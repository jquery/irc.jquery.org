[00:01:15] <Cache_Money> grafi: A lot of solutions are telling me to use D3.js   I'll give it a try.  Thaniks
[00:07:46] <chrnybo> Good morning.  I'm within a new blog framework called Ghost.  Jquery is loaded late in the document.  A little earlier on, I insert client code to alter the DOM.  Is there a hook/callback or something called when jquery is loaded, wherein I could put the DOM-altering code to be executed _after_ JQuery is ready?
[00:08:38] <grafi> $(document).ready(function() {})
[00:09:21] <chrnybo> grafi: But isn't the $ syntax dependent on jquery having been loaded?
[00:09:48] <grafi> might be im still sleeping ._.
[00:09:49] <grafi> :P
[00:09:51] <grafi> erm
[00:10:03] <Cork> chrnybo: no there is nothing you can hook into
[00:10:27] <Cork> chrnybo: and if jquery is loaded at the bottom of the document you are losing much of the page load features of jquery
[00:11:45] <chrnybo> Cork: OK, loading late is not a religious issue to me.  So the regular solution would be to load jquery in the html headers or something?
[00:11:58] <Cork> chrnybo: yes
[00:12:10] <Cork> or you would have to use something else to let you know when scripts are loaded
[00:12:17] <Cork> like ex. require.js
[00:15:25] <k_sze[work]> Anybody knows how $(document).ready() works in IE8?
[00:16:00] <aagii> hi guys
[00:16:08] <k_sze[work]> I'm trying to attach a handler manually to document.onreadystatechange
[00:16:23] <Cork> k_sze[work]: it falls back to load
[00:16:33] <k_sze[work]> somehow my handler is run after $(document).ready() when I want it to run before
[00:16:43] <aagii> after updated jquery 1.4.2 to 1.10.2, some selectors not working
[00:17:02] <Cork> aagii: example?
[00:17:31] <aagii> dynamically drawed button not working
[00:17:50] <Cork> aagii: please create an example on jsfiddle.net
[00:18:32] <aagii> ok
[00:19:22] <k_sze[work]> Cork: how about IE9? also fall back to load?
[00:19:45] <Cork> k_sze[work]: just noticed
[00:19:54] <Cork> ready isn't onreadystatechange
[00:20:04] <Cork> it's DOMContentLoaded
[00:20:08] <aagii> cork: http://jsfiddle.net/P56BH/
[00:20:17] <Cork> k_sze[work]: and yes it is supported in ie9
[00:20:30] <Cork> k_sze[work]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/DOMContentLoaded
[00:21:24] <aagii> cork: first function is working, second is not working
[00:21:25] <k_sze[work]> Cork: I see. Thanks.
[00:21:52] <Cork> aagii: uh, a working example; meaning it actually runs please....
[00:22:40] <Cork> aagii: especially i need to know the html, and what gets added when
[00:27:00] <aagii> cork: updated the html what gets added http://jsfiddle.net/P56BH/1/
[00:27:50] <Cork> ah, let me guess you replaced live with on?
[00:28:05] <aagii> yes i already replaced
[00:28:19] <aagii> but there is no action
[00:28:20] <Cork> on uses a different syntax then live
[00:28:43] <Cork> aagii: this is the equiv to live http://jsfiddle.net/P56BH/2/
[00:28:45] <aagii> i tested do alert
[00:28:51] <Cork> read up on delegate and on
[00:28:54] <Cork> ?api delegate
[00:28:54] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:28:55] <Cork> ?api on
[00:28:59] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:29:55] <aagii> i think selector doesnt find the element
[00:30:41] <Cork> ya, cause you used a selector for a static element
[00:30:54] <Cork> if checks for element that matches that selector as that line runs
[00:31:01] <Cork> and binds an event listener to those elements
[00:31:12] <Cork> if you add or replace them you have no listeners at all
[00:31:21] <Cork> so you need to use delegation
[00:31:39] <Cork> aagii: this is what live did, just with a broken syntax
[00:32:16] <aagii> cork: its working $(document).on('click', '.btnClosePayloadView',function()
[00:32:27] <aagii> cork: thanks
[00:32:39] <Cork> aagii: again read up on those two documentation pages
[00:32:44] <Cork> especially the delegate one
[00:32:53] <aagii> ok
[00:33:03] <aagii> thanks
[00:33:06] <Cork> np
[00:39:10] <aagii> cork: do you mean to use delegation like $( "body" ).on( "click", "p", function() ?
[00:39:28] <Cork> aagii: well if you use body you can just as well use document
[00:39:40] <Cork> the point is you select a parent and then define the delegation selector from there
[00:40:14] <Cork> closest common parent is normally a good choice (the closest parent that is always around)
[00:40:44] <Cork> though body is normally pointless as document is for event close to the same thing
[00:40:46] <aagii> ok i c
[00:41:26] <aagii> now i'm understanding clearly
[00:53:41] <Whiskey> Can someone help me whit this one, http://jsfiddle.net/xdca4/6/
[00:58:24] <grafi> what are you trying to do?
[00:58:43] <Whiskey> hehe first of all i will get rid of the underscore
[00:58:52] <Whiskey> in the text and get it to use the <em>
[01:06:28] <Whiskey> it just use em first time :(
[01:07:10] <Cork> Whiskey: "em first time"?
[01:07:18] <Whiskey> go in the fiddle and check
[01:07:28] <Whiskey> <em>Text</em>
[01:07:32] <Cork> ya?
[01:08:05] <Whiskey> and if you click on the text, the im is gone
[01:08:08] <Whiskey> "em"
[01:08:29] <Cork> well you replace the content of a with only text
[01:08:53] <Cork> if you want to keep the em make a selection for it and change it's text
[01:09:24] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:09:41] <joroci> i can't load fiddle
[01:09:47] <joroci> wtf :|
[01:09:54] <Cork> ya, it's ddosed again
[01:09:57] <Whiskey> yeh its really slow
[01:10:13] <joroci> maybe it's pastebin :P
[01:10:21] <Cork> jsbin.com
[01:15:12] <Whiskey> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zmjrJ here you go
[01:16:24] <Cork> Whiskey: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zmjrJ
[01:16:36] <Cork> Whiskey: also don't create broken links
[01:16:50] <Cork> if you don't plan to provide a link, to use <a> tags
[01:17:30] <Whiskey> nope just a text
[01:17:41] <Cork> then skip the <a> tag
[01:17:42] <doug65536> is $.get guaranteed to be asynchronous (assuming no $.ajaxSetup
[01:17:44] <Whiskey> that going to use js to change view on two diffrent things
[01:17:45] <Cork> you can style the em directly
[01:18:16] <Whiskey> how?
[01:18:32] <doug65536> it will never call the .done before $.get returns, right?
[01:19:04] <Cork> Whiskey: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zmjrJ
[01:19:18] <Whiskey> its unchanged
[01:19:28] <Cork> hmm then how do you save on codepen?
[01:19:41] <Whiskey> click on save copy the link it gives me
[01:20:02] <Cork> there where none, so i made a fork instead http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BCFxe
[01:20:03] <doug65536> Cork: I think you need to fork it
[01:20:28] <Whiskey> you need to open clean one
[01:20:30] <Whiskey> lol thats stupid
[01:20:37] <Whiskey> yeh fork it
[01:21:11] <Whiskey> yeh thats awsome
[01:22:17] <Whiskey> Cork i need two more things, first it need to check that classs "ViewLink" so it won¬¥t break other things
[01:22:25] <Whiskey> and then it also need to check what the text is like this
[01:22:37] <Cork> Whiskey: just replace em with .ViewLink
[01:22:41] <Cork> (in the js)
[01:23:35] <Whiskey> if {ViewLink=="Text"} var text = [$a.text(), 'Image']; elseif {ViewLink=="Image"} var text = [$a.text(), 'Text'];
[01:23:52] <Whiskey> as it can get it from both ways depends on whats my get is set on :)
[01:23:56] <Whiskey> in php
[01:24:12] <Cork> uh... what?
[01:24:21] <Whiskey> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jovfe <-- fixed
[01:24:28] <Whiskey> yeh know its just change the text
[01:24:54] <Whiskey> Switch View: Text <--- its need to know if it says Text and should toogle to Image, or the other way around
[01:25:01] <Cork> Whiskey: actually i would recommend a different solution
[01:25:21] <Whiskey> ok
[01:26:23] <Whiskey> I can load it reversed in PHP from get and do the if question there, but i don¬¥t know whats smartest
[01:28:13] <Cork> Whiskey: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fievx
[01:28:33] <Cork> that is a much cleaner solution as it keeps the content where it belongs; in the html
[01:28:55] <Cork> you could even make it dynamic by changing the selector to delegate
[01:30:21] <Whiskey> yeh that would work
[01:30:40] <Cork> and it would support most anything
[01:31:02] <Whiskey> last thing that i was going to fix my self but is a bit unsure for know is that
[01:31:14] <Whiskey> when Text is toggle it should have css changes
[01:31:36] <Cork> Whiskey: then apply the css rules on the content1 and content2 (you might want to rename those)
[01:31:50] <Whiskey> well yeh
[01:31:51] <Whiskey> but
[01:32:23] <k_sze[work]> It's ok to attach callbacks to a jqXHR *after* it has been sent, and they are still guaranteed to fire, right?
[01:32:47] <Cork> k_sze[work]: as long as you are in the same js stack as the original ajax cal yes
[01:32:52] <Whiskey> lets try it in the fiddle so make sure it gets correct
[01:33:13] <k_sze[work]> same js stack?
[01:33:22] <Cork> Whiskey: also there is nothing preventing you from adding additional classes if you want different styles
[01:33:43] <Cork> j_simon: ex if the js code starts from an event
[01:34:03] <Cork> until you exit the end of that event the ajax call won't happen
[01:34:10] <Cork> so it is safe to attach event listeners
[01:34:22] <Cork> or rather i suspect you mean deferred callbacks
[01:34:37] <Cork> k_sze[work]: but it is NOT safe to do it ex. in a timer
[01:34:43] <Cork> or in a separate event listener
[01:37:02] <alex88> hi guys, why jQuery removes x-requested-with on crossdomain requests? is it unsafe?
[01:37:33] <Whiskey> yeh that works pefect
[01:37:37] <Whiskey> thx cork :)
[01:37:41] <Cork> Whiskey: np
[01:37:46] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/
[01:39:16] <Cork> alex88: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js#L62
[01:39:28] <greek> Hi guys. I've got <td>Meh<span>foo</span></td> with an onmouseover event attached to the td. When I hover mouse over the span, the td's onmouseover no longer triggers in IE. Any ideas?
[01:39:31] <Cork> alex88: you can set it your self though if you want it
[01:39:50] <k_sze[work]> Cork: ok, what if I have two script files, a.js and b.js, a.js creates a $.ajax() and stores it as window.foo, can b.js still safely attach callbacks on window.foo and expect them to fire?
[01:40:10] <Whiskey> Cork, i find one problem do
[01:40:14] <Cork> k_sze[work]: js doens't have a concept of files
[01:40:29] <Whiskey> naa it dosen¬¥t matter really
[01:40:32] <Cork> k_sze[work]: it is all one big blob, with scopes for variable names
[01:40:33] <alex88> Cork: thanks for that, I was just thinking if it could be a problem, seems it got removed by default just because otherwise it creates the preflight request
[01:40:44] <alex88> Cork: you know if there is a way to set it globally?
[01:40:55] <Cork> alex88: sure
[01:41:09] <Cork> ?api ajaxSetup
[01:41:09] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:41:13] <Cork> ?api jQueryajaxSetup
[01:41:14] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:41:16] <Cork> ...
[01:41:20] <Cork> ?api jQuery.ajaxSetup
[01:41:20] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajaxSetup(): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[01:41:30] <k_sze[work]> Cork: which is why I don't understand your idea of a 'stack'.
[01:41:46] <Cork> k_sze[work]: a stack is a short name for "call stack"
[01:41:46] <alex88> Cork: great man! Thanks a lot!!
[01:41:58] <alex88> that saves me lot of time
[01:42:03] <Cork> k_sze[work]: each function you call is added to the call stack when the next function is called
[01:42:14] <Cork> and removed from the call stack as you exist the function
[01:42:34] <Cork> it is what keeps track of what function is currently waiting for the execution pointer to return
[01:42:52] <Cork> when that js call stack gets down to zero the browser starts executing again
[01:43:02] <Cork> and that is when ajax calls fire
[01:43:07] <k_sze[work]> oh
[01:43:10] <k_sze[work]> I didn't know that.
[01:43:27] <Cork> k_sze[work]: except for the delay of browser thing, that is how all code works
[01:44:05] <k_sze[work]> Same thing even for IE8's XDomainRequest? It doesn't actually get sent until the call stack all popped?
[01:44:16] <Cork> yes
[01:44:49] <k_sze[work]> But does that affect how jqXHR.done() works?>
[01:45:06] <CodesStuff> This channel never sleeps
[01:45:08] <CodesStuff> Love it
[01:45:10] <Cork> k_sze[work]: it is vital for .done to work at all :)
[01:45:52] <k_sze[work]> but if I call jqXHR in another call stack, it's still no longer guaranteed to have any effect, correct?
[01:46:10] <Cork> yes, but you rarely ever need to do that
[01:46:38] <k_sze[work]> That's exactly what I'm trying to do now.
[01:47:17] <Cork> k_sze[work]: also deferred (use for ajax) can (and does for ajax) keep around the fired state of the resolve
[01:47:40] <Cork> so if you add a new event listener after the resolve has happened it just fires directly
[01:48:36] <k_sze[work]> I thought you just agreed that it's no longer guaranteed to have any effect.
[01:49:07] <Cork> k_sze[work]: i just talked about how simple callbacks work
[01:49:15] <Cork> and how the normal deferred works
[01:49:26] <CodesStuff> Cork: You worked for jquery/ff right?
[01:49:43] <CodesStuff> I haven't been in here in forever. Can't remember.
[01:49:46] <greek> *bumpHi guys. I've got <td>Meh<span>foo</span></td> with an onmouseover event attached to the td. When I hover mouse over the span, the td's onmouseover no longer triggers in IE. Any ideas?
[01:49:55] <Cork> CodesStuff: uh, worked for?
[01:50:02] <CodesStuff> Or work for, rather.
[01:50:04] <Cork> strictly i would have to say no
[01:50:27] <k_sze[work]> Cork: right, there was a typo in my question. Anyway, jqXHR.done() is guaranteed to fire because it's a Deferred.
[01:50:38] <k_sze[work]> that's what I was trying to establish.
[01:52:34] <Cork> k_sze[work]: hmm just checked the documentation, and it actually looks like they've removed those prefs and made the fireonce default
[01:52:46] <Cork> so yes it is always guaranteed
[01:53:33] <k_sze[work]> Thanks. :D
[01:53:39] <Cork> k_sze[work]: this is similar to what deferred has before http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/#supported-flags
[01:54:10] <Cork> s/has/had/
[01:55:19] <Cork> CodesStuff: i don't work for any of those, i've a few lines of code in firefox, but only bug reports for jquery
[01:55:21] <k_sze[work]> I suppose the naÔve way to emulate the same thing with raw XMLHttpRequest would be something like if (request.readyState === 4) { foo();} else {request.onreadystatechange = foo;}
[01:56:01] <Cork> k_sze[work]: it is similar, but deferred actually let you attach unknown functions after the fact
[01:56:09] <Cork> so it isn't exactly the same
[01:56:14] <Cork> but ya similar
[01:57:03] <k_sze[work]> 'unknown functions'?
[01:57:48] <lemonsparrow> pls help me get a shorthand comparison for this case http://pastebin.com/Vpy9L0dt
[01:57:53] <Cork> defobj.resolve(value); (way later somewhere else) defobj.done(function(value) {}); <-- and this will fire with the data
[01:58:13] <jsteunou> hi there
[01:58:33] <jsteunou> I got an issue with $.when I think
[01:58:51] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it really doesn't get much shorter then that; unless you resort to raw html
[01:58:59] <CodesStuff> Cork: Ah. Perhaps it was someone else.
[02:00:02] <Cork> lemonsparrow: though that said [userObj[i].firstName, userObj[i].lastName].join(' ').trim() ?
[02:00:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this aint working if (a == null && b==null)? "":(a +" "+ b)
[02:00:50] <jsteunou> I got a function called in a "done" of a $.when but all errors in it seem to be "catch"
[02:01:02] <jsteunou> I dont see nothing in any web console
[02:01:21] <jsteunou> if I remove the "done" and manually start my app i do see the errors back
[02:01:47] <jop008> I want to create a popup I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/51/ but no output
[02:04:35] <Nancy2012> I am using jquery ui datepicker in which i have 2 dates (StartData and  EndDate). My problem is soo simple‚Ä¶ Actually, i want if i would select 27/10/2013 (Start Date) then all the previous dates and even 27/10/2013 must be disable.. because i want my user can select the end date which must be higher than start date . Here is my Code.. http://jsfiddle.net/3yVYx/
[02:05:14] <Nancy2012>  thanks in advance for your support
[02:09:22] <k_sze[work]> Cork: but this is also ok, right? http://jsfiddle.net/7X4KD/
[02:10:10] <Cork> k_sze[work]: no need if you want to attach it like that
[02:10:25] <Cork> hmm
[02:10:28] <Cork> or is it...
[02:10:48] <k_sze[work]> because we're talking about a different call stack in the later part.
[02:10:53] <Cork> k_sze[work]: ah, ya that should work
[02:11:18] <Cork> had to think for min to follow what you did
[02:11:23] <k_sze[work]> :D
[02:12:14] <k_sze[work]> And even though window.foo has already been sent, its readyState is guaranteed to not change in the middle of the execution of the second call stack, right?
[02:12:15] <Cork> k_sze[work]: just make sure you never run that second section more then once per call
[02:12:29] <Cork> k_sze[work]: yes
[02:13:29] <k_sze[work]> Cork: more than once per call? per what call?
[02:13:39] <Cork> k_sze[work]: per ajax call
[02:14:02] <Cork> k_sze[work]: as you you call the onreadystatechange more then once the first function will be lost
[02:14:11] <k_sze[work]> ah
[02:14:14] <Cork> or rather it can only keep one reference
[02:14:53] <k_sze[work]> well, attachEvent or addEventListener then?
[02:15:12] <Cork> you can't use event listeners for those
[02:15:19] <Cork> cause it isn't really events
[02:15:22] <Nancy2012> I am using jquery ui datepicker in which i have 2 dates (StartData and  EndDate). My problem is soo simple‚Ä¶ Actually, i want if i would select 27/10/2013 (Start Date) then all the previous dates and even 27/10/2013 must be disable.. because i want my user can select the end date which must be higher than start date . Here is my Code.. http://jsfiddle.net/3yVYx/
[02:15:42] <k_sze[work]> ah well
[02:16:00] <Cork> k_sze[work]: but if you are using jquery why do it the hard way?
[02:16:10] <k_sze[work]> thank god I am not concerned with multiple event handlers for my usage.
[02:17:37] <k_sze[work]> Because I'm masochistic
[02:18:07] <k_sze[work]> no really, because there's a request that I want to fire before jQuery and a whole bunch of other libraries are loaded.
[02:19:27] <jop008> How to open a popup? http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/59/
[02:20:23] <Cork> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/60/?
[02:21:12] <jop008> thx what did you change?
[02:23:12] <seutje> changed the script loading to be onload
[02:23:15] <Cork> delayed the load
[02:23:42] <seutje> but... it shows the popup instantly, whereas it didn't before
[02:23:59] <seutje> I don't see the issue with 59
[02:24:49] <Cork> well that was what i though 59 was about
[02:25:06] <seutje> it works, cause it injects it at the bottom of the body
[02:25:21] <Cork> i don't get the popup on load here
[02:25:32] <Cork> only if i click it
[02:25:43] <seutje> oh, it's supposed to open right away? my bad... I need coffee...
[02:27:10] <greek> I've got <td>Meh<span>foo</span></td> with an onmouseover event attached to the td. When I hover mouse over the span, the td's onmouseover no longer triggers in IE. Any ideas?
[02:27:36] <CodesStuff> greek, jsfiddle please.
[02:27:39] <greek> It seems it has something to do with the onmouseout on the td. For some reason, when I hover over the span, it executes the td's mouseout event
[02:27:54] <Cork> greek: historically tables elements has been iffy when it comes to styling and events
[02:28:08] <Cork> so if you by ie mean older ie that might be it
[02:28:11] <CodesStuff> greek: because <span> envelopes the span contents only, not the full dimensions of the <td>
[02:28:12] <greek> ie9
[02:28:23] <CodesStuff> Also, stop using tables unless absolutely required.
[02:28:36] <greek> CodesStuff, yeah it's required, thanks
[02:28:42] <Cork> well it should be used for table data
[02:28:46] <Nancy2012> I am using jquery ui datepicker in which i have 2 dates (StartData and  EndDate). My problem is soo simple‚Ä¶ Actually, i want if i would select 27/10/2013 (Start Date) then all the previous dates and even 27/10/2013 must be disable.. because i want my user can select the end date which must be higher than start date . Here is my Code.. http://jsfiddle.net/3yVYx/
[02:28:47] <Nancy2012> [10:15am]
[02:28:56] <greek> also, the span is inside the td, so not sure why td's onmouseout is being executed when hovering over the span
[02:29:11] <CodesStuff> greek: Make a jsfiddle and I'll take a peek.
[02:29:15] <greek> thanks will do
[02:29:48] <CodesStuff> I like jquery. I used it to power one of my more popular desktop applications (which is hilarious).
[02:35:07] <jop008> I want to replace all my alerts to popups what is the best way to do that?
[02:35:21] <CodesStuff> ctrl + h? :p
[02:36:06] <CodesStuff> function malert(){ /*modal code here*/ }, then CTLR + H "alert" with "malert"
[02:36:26] <CodesStuff> obviously pass in the alert "text" into function def
[02:37:36] <Cork> or just window.alert = replacement;
[02:37:52] <Cork> ex. window.alert = console.log;
[02:38:25] <CodesStuff> that makes sense, too. I never liked redefining window.* functions, though. makes me paranoid they won't come back :D
[02:38:42] <Cork> lol
[02:38:47] <Cork> delete window.alert;
[02:39:30] <CodesStuff> put it on a setInterval in a browser extension and inject into the DOM of every page
[02:39:41] <CodesStuff> That would be hilariously evil.
[02:39:51] <lenswipe> hey guys
[02:39:56] <lenswipe> can someone help me out with something
[02:39:58] <Cork> CodesStuff: uh.. no
[02:40:05] <seutje> u want evil? Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty = function() {return !!Math.round(Math.random());}
[02:40:07] <lenswipe> im having trouble using .on to bind a dynamic event
[02:40:08] <CodesStuff> Not as good as preventDefault() on <a> onclick.
[02:40:09] <Cork> CodesStuff: you should use use defineProperty there
[02:40:14] <lenswipe> is this even possible with .on?
[02:40:28] <lenswipe> or to put it another way, should it work and im doing it wrong?
[02:40:31] <Cork> lenswipe: read up on delegate
[02:40:39] <CodesStuff> Cork: I've never used defineProperty. Googlin' now
[02:40:39] <Cork> lenswipe: and yes on can do it too
[02:40:49] <Cork> ?api delegate @ lenswipe
[02:40:49] <b-ot> lenswipe: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:40:59] <Cork> lenswipe: read then and then the on documentation
[02:41:22] <lenswipe> Cork, whats happening is that an AJAX call is returning some HTML form elements including a button and I need to bind a click handler to the button and for some reason I can't fathom the damn thing isn't firing
[02:41:29] <lenswipe> I read the docs and even put together a jsfiddle
[02:41:31] <lenswipe> it worked in the jsfiddle
[02:41:35] <Cork> lenswipe: read the link i gave you
[02:41:40] <lenswipe> Cork, Im about to
[02:41:46] * lenswipe puts cork in the water and watches him float
[02:42:08] <Cork> i wish they removed live before they added on
[02:42:13] <Cork> it would have made life easier
[02:42:36] <seutje> the fact that delegate takes its arguments in a different order doesn't help either
[02:42:53] <lenswipe> Corey, well I've inherited a project that used to use .live  and someone has literally just done a find replace for .live and replaced with .on
[02:42:58] <lenswipe> with predictable results
[02:43:02] <lenswipe> Cork* even
[02:43:11] <Cork> well a LOT of users do s/\.live/\.on/g "why isn't it working"
[02:43:16] <Cork> and it starts to be a bit annoying
[02:43:21] <seutje> lol
[02:43:22] <lenswipe> yeah well that's what happened here
[02:43:35] <lenswipe> except i put the args in the correcet order and it's still not working :-/
[02:43:43] <Cork> lenswipe: you need to read up on how delegate works, and then use the delegate syntax for on
[02:43:44] <seutje> better off monkey patching it
[02:43:52] <Cork> lenswipe: else you are just using bind with a different name
[02:43:58] <CodesStuff> ?abortion
[02:44:03] <lenswipe> Corey, can I give you a jsfiddle of what I am doing?
[02:44:10] <CodesStuff> Aw, did bot-t get new commands? :[
[02:44:29] <Cork> lenswipe: really just read those two documents and you WILL know why it isn't
[02:44:33] <CodesStuff> ?you destroyed my site
[02:44:42] <Cork> even just the first 10 lines of delegate will help
[02:44:55] <lenswipe> Cork, I'll do that
[02:44:57] <CodesStuff> Derp. Looks like he got updated. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17612316/bot-t/factoids.html
[02:45:34] <lenswipe> Cork, I assume you refer to: $("table").delegate("tr", "click", function(){}));
[02:45:47] <Cork> lenswipe: yes that is an example yes
[02:45:56] <lenswipe> Cork, yeah - that's what im doing :(
[02:46:08] <Cork> and table is always around?
[02:47:40] <lenswipe> Cork, it's not a table - it's a form, but no
[02:47:43] <lenswipe> this is what im doing: http://jsfiddle.net/LGvjE/
[02:47:59] <Cork> lenswipe: well if the selector doesn't match anything you won't get any event listener
[02:48:08] <lenswipe> look at the jsfiddle
[02:48:12] <lenswipe> :-)
[02:48:22] <seutje> lenswipe: the fiddle doesn't have any dynamic elements to it
[02:48:25] <Cork> $('tr').live() does the same thing as $(document).on('click, 'tr')
[02:48:35] <lenswipe> seutje, no it doesn't, but that's the syntax I'm using
[02:48:40] <CodesStuff> ^^seutje: yeah, i was looking at it like "wat"
[02:48:49] <Cork> lenswipe: when you add delegate or on you must point it to a sticky parent
[02:48:59] <seutje> lenswipe: lemme guess, the #address_fields gets injected?
[02:48:59] <CodesStuff> lenswipe: Maybe add the event handler after the DOM is populated with the stuff you want to modify?
[02:49:00] <Cork> else it can't delegate to it; as the element isn't there
[02:49:19] <Cork> CodesStuff: or just use the commands correctly...
[02:49:22] <lenswipe> seutje, no I don't think it does...although now that you mention it, that's worth checking
[02:49:27] <seutje> it's kind of impossible to see the problem if your presenting it entirely differently
[02:49:31] <Cork> you want to delegate events cause it doesn't slow down the dom as much
[02:49:32] <CodesStuff> Cork: Stop using that logic stuff.
[02:49:34] <lenswipe> Cork, what do you mean by stick parent?
[02:49:45] <seutje> a parent that doesn't change
[02:49:47] <lenswipe> okay
[02:49:48] <Cork> lenswipe: $('select') makes a search through the dom
[02:49:56] <lenswipe> right
[02:50:00] <Cork> it builds a list of those matched elements
[02:50:05] <Yatekii> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0f9988721ae415131b78 Guys why does the first .push not work? :S
[02:50:10] <Yatekii> ahhhh the second
[02:50:12] <Cork> if you want to run commands on that the elements much be in that list
[02:50:20] <lenswipe> seutje, im not using the jsfiddle as a demonstration of the problem; just a demonstration of my syntax.
[02:50:21] <seutje> Yatekii: is blobs an array?
[02:50:30] <Cork> lenswipe: and that was one of the problems with .live
[02:50:32] <Yatekii> seutje: ya
[02:50:39] <lenswipe> Cork, seutje well ill go make sure that #address_fields is "sticky"
[02:51:04] <Cork> lenswipe: well the correct term is prob static
[02:51:09] <Cork> not sure though
[02:51:14] <lenswipe> either way
[02:51:23] <lenswipe> as a sidenote, is .delegate faster than .on?
[02:51:23] <Yatekii> seutje: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/eb9006522c9dc594d0a3
[02:51:28] <lenswipe> or are they the same
[02:51:34] <Cork> lenswipe: no it is the exact same command
[02:51:41] <lenswipe> okay
[02:51:46] <lenswipe> are they literally just aliases of each other?
[02:51:52] <Cork> lenswipe: delegate was around before on, and no it is just a small translation function that calls on
[02:51:54] <seutje> Yatekii: the first doesn't fail, the second does
[02:52:33] <Yatekii> seutje: yeah as I said
[02:52:33] <lenswipe> Cork, im looking at the response where the dynamic form fields come back and it doesn't look like #address_fields is in there
[02:52:40] <lenswipe> Cork, the form is, but not the surrounding div
[02:52:41] <Yatekii> but why?
[02:52:42] <seutje> Yatekii: basically, on the first iteration of the outside loop, you add 1 array to blob, making blob[0] an array and all the rest empty
[02:53:08] <seutje> Yatekii: you then initialize a loop trying to push to blobl[0], blob[1], ... blob[99]
[02:53:09] <Yatekii> seutje: and now where is the Problem?
[02:53:14] <seutje> Yatekii: but only blob[0] is an array
[02:53:21] <Yatekii> and?
[02:53:22] <seutje> blob[1] is undefined, and thus has no push method
[02:53:34] <Cork> lenswipe: basically console.log($('selector').length > 0) must be true
[02:53:38] <seutje> also, stop using new Array()
[02:53:43] <Cork> lenswipe: if it isn't you have broken code
[02:53:47] <Yatekii> ahm seutje that is why I push a new array every iteration? oO
[02:54:03] <lenswipe> Cork, where "selector" is #address_fields ?
[02:54:37] <Cork> lenswipe: anyway simplest if it's for an old project is prob to convert $('selector').live('click') to $(document).on('click', 'selector)
[02:54:39] <seutje> Yatekii: every outside loop, you initiate an inside loop that loops 100 times
[02:54:47] <Yatekii> seutje: I initialize a loop that pushes Arrays for every iteration and a second loop that pushes things inside that new array.
[02:54:55] <Cork> lenswipe: then you would get the EXACT same behavior but with the new syntax
[02:54:58] <lenswipe> okay
[02:55:01] <seutje> Yatekii: nope
[02:55:06] <Yatekii> seutje: but the inside loop just operates on that newly pushed array.
[02:55:10] <seutje> Yatekii: you make 100 loops of 100
[02:55:11] <Yatekii> blobs[i];
[02:55:20] <Yatekii> blobs[I]
[02:55:22] <Yatekii> and NOT J
[02:55:42] <seutje> Yatekii: ur incrementin i though
[02:55:54] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/jD4MZ/
[02:55:55] <lenswipe> Cork, ill give that a try
[02:56:31] <seutje> so in essence, you we only doing 1 iteration
[02:56:35] <seutje> were*
[02:57:32] <Yatekii> I do not see the difference between your and my code ...
[02:58:02] <seutje> i++ vs j++
[02:58:16] <seutje> fine, just bolt
[02:58:37] <seutje> now I didn't get to explain why he should use literal notation instead :(
[02:58:56] <Yatekii> no I did not oO
[02:59:22] <seutje> well, this is eerie
[02:59:53] <Yatekii> nah why?
[03:00:02] <Yatekii> there is no difference between your code and mine lol
[03:00:06] <seutje> fine
[03:00:08] <seutje> use yours
[03:00:27] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/jD4MZ/1/
[03:00:35] <seutje> made another tiny change
[03:01:08] <seutje> see it?
[03:01:08] <Yatekii> seutje: tell me which lines differ
[03:01:14] <Yatekii> I just see the []
[03:01:21] <Yatekii> instead of new Array()
[03:01:26] <Yatekii> the loops are EXACTLY the same
[03:02:21] <seutje> yeah, that's the second change
[03:02:48] <Yatekii> seutje: there is no other difference ... name me the line
[03:02:50] <seutje> lines 3 and 4 I guess
[03:03:06] <seutje> I shall name them... John and Louie
[03:03:21] <seutje> no wait, the other way around
[03:03:30] <seutje> cause John is the one where I replaced i with j
[03:03:45] <seutje> and Louie cause I changed line 3 to use a literal notation
[03:04:12] <Yatekii> seutje: yeah that was what I found myself, sorry
[03:04:16] <Yatekii> but was still not working
[03:04:20] <Yatekii> somehow it does now
[03:04:26] <Yatekii> I am sorry for the inconvenience :S
[03:04:27] <seutje> magic!
[03:04:36] * seutje whips out the jazz hands
[03:04:48] <lenswipe> Corey, I got it working using the $(document).on() method - thanks! :)
[03:04:51] <lenswipe> Cork, *
[03:04:57] <lenswipe> this problem has been bugging me for ages
[03:05:08] <seutje> Yatekii: but yeah, you should use literal notation: http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/2151-when-to-use-the-array-literal-notation-in-javascript/
[03:05:30] <Cork> lenswipe: well you might want to find closer static parents, but for an old project it normally isn't worth it if you don't know it well
[03:05:43] <Yatekii> seutje: changed it yet :) still do not understand why ^^
[03:05:53] <seutje> xcept when you want to do funky stuff like new Array(100).join('lol')
[03:06:21] <lenswipe> Cork, I started this job Monday last week
[03:06:24] <lenswipe> so...yeah...
[03:06:25] <lenswipe> :-/
[03:07:08] <seutje> lenswipe: might be interesting to keep their selector and just move them to the body
[03:07:24] <seutje> I've done that when converting from live to on
[03:07:42] <dwarder> how do i have a selector by .data() ?
[03:07:57] <Cork> seutje: there is no point in moving it to body over document
[03:08:20] <Cork> dwarder: you don't
[03:08:30] <Cork> .data isn't added to the dom, so you can't select on it
[03:08:31] <seutje> Cork: oh, I wasn't implying there is
[03:09:00] <Cork> dwarder: if you need it added to the dom you can use attr
[03:09:09] <Cork> though you lost much of the functionality of .data
[03:09:26] <Cork> .data('something') => .attr('data-something')
[03:10:08] <andywww> Hi, i am writing my first plugin. I need it to react to a window resize. Is it considered better practice to pass window as a parameter or can I just put $(window).resize(); in my plugin?
[03:10:41] <Cork> andywww: $(document).on('resize.your-plugin-name', func)
[03:10:56] <Cork> opps window not document
[03:12:05] <andywww> so if i had a private method inside my plugin that handled all the resize stuff, I'd put that method in there?
[03:12:19] <andywww> i was thinking $.pluginname.resize
[03:12:26] <andywww> but that would be wrong, wouldn't it?
[03:12:42] <Cork> andywww: depends if that function uses this
[03:12:49] <andywww> one sec
[03:12:54] <Cork> and $.pluginname.resize isn't reall private :)
[03:13:00] <Cork> *really
[03:13:26] <Cork> andywww: just add a scope around your plugin and create the function in that
[03:13:31] <Cork> no need to expose it to the public
[03:13:55] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e9d2c7b7eaa7a2975fb0
[03:14:21] <andywww> i'd like to trigger resize each time the window is resized
[03:14:57] <Cork> andywww: then just give resize to on
[03:15:16] <Cork> $(window).on('resize.webbo', resize);
[03:15:25] <andywww> ah excellent
[03:15:27] <andywww> thanks for that
[03:15:31] <Cork> and if you ever want to remove it
[03:15:48] <Cork> do $(window).off('.webbo') and all your events on window will be removed
[03:15:57] <andywww> i see
[03:16:10] <andywww> is there any way to make it completely self contained within the plugin?
[03:16:13] <Cork> you can do resize.webbo too if you want just that one
[03:16:21] <Cork> not really
[03:16:25] <Cork> as it is event listeners
[03:16:29] <andywww> bummer
[03:16:58] <andywww> alright well that looks tidy enough for me, i'll implant that
[03:16:59] <andywww> thanks again
[03:17:11] <andywww> implement
[03:17:12] <Cork> andywww: also $(document.createElement('img')) => $('<img>')
[03:17:16] <andywww> fkin autocorrect
[03:17:18] <Cork> no need for document.createElement
[03:17:38] <andywww> yeah i read a bit on that
[03:17:54] <andywww> apparently it a gnats cock faster if you use document.create element
[03:18:21] <andywww> that said its less code :)
[03:18:40] <Cork> andywww: jquery has a fast path for <[tag name]>
[03:18:48] <Cork> so no the speed difference is none existing
[03:19:00] <andywww> cool, i'll swap that too!
[03:19:01] <Cork> compared to passing html to $() is another matter
[03:19:06] <andywww> any other bits that could be optimised?
[03:20:14] <Cork> nextArrow.add(nextArrow).click(function(e) { e.repeventDefault(); });
[03:20:18] <Cork> no need for the each loop
[03:20:47] <Cork> opps nextArrow.add(prevArrow)
[03:21:48] <andywww> next arrow and prev arrow are two separate elements though?
[03:22:01] <Cork> so?
[03:22:11] <andywww> would i do one line per element?
[03:22:14] <Cork> jquery is at core an array of elements
[03:22:19] <Cork> no
[03:22:32] <Cork> evens will be bound on all elements in the jquery array
[03:23:09] <Cork> so you basically loop an array create a new array with one element in it and loop that array and bind click
[03:23:18] <Cork> instead of just looping the first array and binding click :)
[03:23:24] <andywww> aah
[03:23:31] <seutje> u can use a single handler that determines which to do
[03:23:54] <andywww> so how would that each look written properly then?
[03:24:07] <Cork> andywww: like i showed you
[03:24:17] <Cork> nextArrow.add(prevArrow).click(function(e) { e.repeventDefault(); });
[03:24:26] <Cork> it would do the same as the code you have
[03:24:40] <andywww> nextArrow.add(prevArrow).click(function(e) { e.repeventDefault(); });
[03:25:01] <andywww> with prevent spelled correctly of course
[03:25:11] <Cork> :x
[03:25:12] <Cork> XD
[03:25:17] <Cork> sorry about that
[03:25:22] <andywww> hah no worries
[03:25:26] <andywww> but thats correct, yeah?
[03:25:29] <Cork> ya
[03:25:32] <andywww> perfect
[03:25:33] <andywww> thanks
[03:26:20] <seutje> it's okay Cork, we'll just map it over :P
[03:26:27] <Cork> XD
[03:47:23] <zhulikas> I have a div which is inside a tab
[03:47:28] <zhulikas> jquery ui tab
[03:47:43] <zhulikas> but I want that specific div to be visible in two different tabs
[03:48:30] <CodesStuff> mirror the content, or just grab the .html() from one div and put it in the other.
[03:48:47] <CodesStuff> im sure there is some weird selector you could use, but I'm not aware of it
[03:48:49] <zhulikas> just got an idea to listen for tab click event
[03:48:54] <zhulikas> and then switch parent of that div
[03:48:58] <zhulikas> to a div of another tab
[03:49:17] <Yatekii> anyone of you knows snapsvg.io?
[03:49:22] <joroci> got a fiddle?
[03:49:31] <joroci> or something
[03:50:58] <joroci> zhulikas?
[03:51:03] <zhulikas> no
[03:51:33] <joroci> oh you solved it :)?
[03:51:49] <zhulikas> almost :D
[03:52:08] <zhulikas> $("#newParent").append($("#childToMove").detach());
[03:52:28] <zhulikas> seems like a hack, but everything in javascript does
[04:09:06] <cannap> Hi
[04:09:20] <cannap> ho can i in the jquery-ui disable past days?
[04:09:47] <Cork> your talking about the date picker?
[04:10:40] <Cork> cannap: ?
[04:10:45] <cannap> yes$
[04:10:53] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-minDate
[04:13:57] <cannap> ah so easy minDate: 0
[04:14:05] <cannap> thx
[04:19:09] <mls_> hi all
[04:19:59] <mls_> how to register 2 differents click events on the same element depending on the classes it has (would be "class1" and "class1 inactive")
[04:21:50] <Cork> mls_: check .hasClass() in the callback
[04:23:00] <mls_> cork : so I only register the on click on the ".class1" and inside the callback i test if "inactive" is present, ok thanks l:)
[04:23:31] <Cork> mls_: $() and .click is two separate things
[04:23:44] <Cork> $() searches through the dom for element that matches the selector you gave it
[04:23:50] <Cork> it then builds an array
[04:24:02] <Cork> .click then loops that array and adds event listeners to those elements
[04:24:18] <Cork> mls_: so it isn't dynamic, it is just a way to get a list of elements
[04:24:43] <Cork> mls_: if you want to get a dynamic selector for event listeners use delegated events
[04:25:17] <mls_> Cork: how to do delegated events ?
[04:25:26] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:25:26] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:25:44] <Cork> mls_: on can do it too, but be sure to read up on it so you use the correct syntax
[04:25:49] <Cork> ?api on
[04:25:49] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:26:04] <mls_> I'm always using .on() atm
[04:26:15] <Cork> again read up on the syntax
[04:26:21] <mls_> Cork: ok thanks
[04:26:45] <Cork> np
[04:30:53] <mls_> Cork: for what I'm reading on .on() it's not dynamic, they specify to be sure to call .on on existing elements. Thought it was dynamic too ?
[04:31:10] <Cork> mls_: read the first link i gave you
[04:31:22] <Cork> it will explain how it works, and yes on can do the same thing as delegate
[04:31:50] <Cork> but you have to be careful with on as it has several different way of acting depending on it's arguments
[04:32:33] <GreatPotato_> I need to preload some sound files, can i do this by just making an ajax request to them?
[04:32:58] <Cork> GreatPotato_: ajax is meant for text so no
[04:33:10] <Cork> you would have to fiddle with preloading
[04:33:28] <Cork> haven't done that for sound though so not sure how that is done
[04:33:36] <GreatPotato_> The problem is, different buttons have different sounds, and i want to load all the sounds so that there is no pause when the button is clicked
[04:33:43] <Cork> but i suspect it includes fiddling with the Audio constructor
[04:33:57] <GreatPotato_> Im using this: https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-audio-fx
[04:34:28] <GreatPotato_> So i need to find a way of preloading all the audio files initially so they don't have to load on click, as they are already loaded
[04:34:51] <Cork> GreatPotato_: looks like that script has that built in
[04:36:15] <GreatPotato_> That just provides a callback for when the sound has loaded, doesn't let me load them all initially
[04:36:47] <Cork> GreatPotato_: well when you create the audio object it will request the resource
[04:36:57] <Cork> you will have to wait for the resource to load
[04:37:01] <Cork> no way around that
[04:37:25] <GreatPotato_> Might help if i give a little more insight...
[04:37:28] <GreatPotato_> Im using http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/
[04:37:36] <CodesStuff> Cork: No pseudo-streaming?
[04:37:38] <GreatPotato_> And basically have sounds playing on next/prev slide
[04:37:54] <Cork> CodesStuff: well you will still have to wait for part of it to load
[04:37:58] <GreatPotato_> But sometimes its taking 3-4 seconds to play because of slow connection
[04:38:02] <Cork> but yes there is streaming support
[04:38:28] <Cork> GreatPotato_: so create the objects on page load and show a throbber while you load the sounds files
[04:38:46] <CodesStuff> GreatPotato_: preload it, then.
[04:38:51] <Cork> ...
[04:39:05] <Cork> CodesStuff: read up on the question before saying things >_<
[04:39:09] <CodesStuff> Never
[04:39:41] <CodesStuff> I want coffee. DUNKIN TIME!
[04:44:16] <jop008> what is the correct <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> line for a jqMobile site?
[04:44:27] <jop008> Now users can zoom
[04:45:23] <Cork> if you don't want zoom you add user-scalable=0,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0
[04:45:58] <jop008> Now I use this function http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/77/
[04:46:09] <jop008> but users can still zoom
[04:46:53] <Cork> don't think you can dynamically change those; not sure though
[04:47:10] <jop008> so the best is use <meta?
[04:47:17] <Cork> also that ua sniffer is very broken
[04:48:11] <jop008> So I drop it
[04:49:29] <jop008> It works!

[05:24:10] <troop> hello i'm looking a script does load the page just then while scrolling down
[05:24:19] <troop> whats that script's name?
[05:43:24] <seutje> troop: infinite scroll?
[05:43:45] <troop> seutje: no not infinite, i will find an example and show you
[05:44:43] <troop> seutje: for example http://visia.themes.pixelentity.com/
[05:45:25] <seutje> troop: parallax?
[05:45:32] <troop> seutje: this is more good example http://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/full_screen_preview/2833226
[05:45:49] <troop> scroll down slightly
[05:48:03] <seutje> sorta different though
[05:48:14] <seutje> this looks like a poorly implemented position: sticky;
[05:48:23] <seutje> whereas the other was a straight up parallax
[05:49:14] <troop> hmm
[05:49:33] <troop> but it occurs once when load page
[05:49:35] <troop> just once
[05:51:00] <seutje> troop: oh,u mean the slideshow that opens or the menu bar that scrolls along?
[05:52:23] <troop> seutje: find this text at the page "Blog Slideshow Post" and observe that the thumbnail loads when you reach the text
[05:52:31] <troop> but before, reload the page
[05:52:37] <troop> http://themeforest.net/item/avada-responsive-multipurpose-theme/full_screen_preview/2833226
[05:53:17] <troop> contents come to page with animation while scrolling down
[05:53:24] <troop> but once.
[05:58:18] <seutje> troop: oh, a lazy loader?
[06:05:09] <nardev> hello, i have some custom tags to hold some values for me and infect i have them nested one into another. when i try to select this one it works .children('feedback').html() but when i try to select the inner one with this it doesn't work .children('feedback correct').html()
[06:05:15] <nardev> am i doing something wrong?
[06:05:43] <nardev> Is ti possible at to do it that way? i also tried using > but it didn't work
[06:07:10] <seutje> nardev: children only selects the direct children of the element(s) you called it on
[06:07:19] <seutje> nardev: passing a string to children filters that collection
[06:08:55] <seutje> basically, ur telling it, give me all the children and filter it down to the one that has an element type of "feedback correct"
[06:09:18] <seutje> which is impossible, since <feedback correct> would cause correct to be interpreted as attribute instead of part of the element name
[06:09:31] <nardev> seutje, ahaa.. OKI DOKI
[06:09:50] <seutje> nardev: prolly best to use find instead of children
[06:10:14] <seutje> like .find('> feedback correct')
[06:10:28] <seutje> I added the > to make it mimic the way children works
[06:10:38] <seutje> as in, only check the direct descendants
[06:11:44] <seutje> thing to remember is that methods like children, siblings, parent, ... only have a depth of 1
[06:12:09] <seutje> that's prolly a pretty shitty explanation though
[06:13:03] <troop> seutje: sorry for late, is that lazy loader?
[06:14:38] <seutje> `g jquer ylazy loader
[06:14:39] <b-ot> seutje: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüjquer ylazy loader‚Äù.

[06:16:20] <treeprogram> hi, does anyone know of a way to submit the data of a form to two locations upon a submit? I don't know whether it's better to try to do it client side, or server side in PHP
[06:16:48] <Cork> treeprogram: you could send an extra set through ajax
[06:17:07] <treeprogram> Cork: thanks
[06:17:14] <Cork> though it might be better to do it server side, depending on how important it is
[06:17:48] <nerder> hello
[06:17:51] <treeprogram> Cork: not superimportant. I get several form submissions a day, and only a small percentage of them end up being valuable. I could afford to lose a couple
[06:17:54] <nerder> i have some problem with this script
[06:18:15] <nerder> http://dribbble.com/shots/345520-Share-Buttons-PSD
[06:18:29] <nardev> seutje, thnx
[06:18:53] <nerder> i implemented that in my own web site: http://pieceofitaly.com
[06:19:10] <nerder> but the G+ button doesent appear
[06:19:39] <nerder> and cause of that even the css in "broken"
[06:20:35] <seutje> nerder: the google plus wrapper is empty, missing some markup
[06:21:12] <seutje> also, this image is missing: http://pieceofitaly.com/img/example6.png
[06:21:38] <nerder> i see
[06:21:45] <nerder> so i have to download even the image right?
[06:22:03] <seutje> it also seems to be trying to access this url: http://pieceofitaly.com/sharrre.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsharrre.com%2F&type=googlePlus
[06:24:15] <seutje> nerder: looks like it expects you to pass a urlCurl in the options argument: http://sharrre.com/#documentation
[06:25:20] <nerder> old on
[06:25:38] <nerder> hold on*
[06:26:59] <nerder> so what i have to do? i have to upload sharrre.php?
[06:29:51] <nerder> ok seutje G+ button appear but css is steel broken
[06:30:26] <nerder> but the image that you asking for there's not
[06:31:28] <seutje> I'm not asking for an image
[06:31:46] <seutje> you are making my browser ask for one, but ur correct in saying it isn't there
[06:32:05] <nerder> <seutje> also, this image is missing: http://pieceofitaly.com/img/example6.png
[06:32:07] <seutje> you also put the wrong text in the google plus one
[06:32:23] <nerder> umm
[06:33:29] <seutje> and the span shouldn't be in the G+ one
[06:35:12] <nerder> yep cause is fit for "+1" not for "Google+" i guess
[06:35:57] <seutje> no, the G+ one doesn't get an icon, so there doesn't need to be a span for it, taking up space
[06:36:56] <nerder> i have to move up?
[06:39:30] <seutje> no clue what that's supposed to mean
[06:50:56] <limpc> hi guys
[06:51:28] <limpc> im having a frustrating time trying to pass an array of html strings back to the server via $.ajax.  no matter what I do, the back-end (php) is always saying there's only 1 element in a multi-element array
[06:51:59] <limpc> each array element is an encodeURIComponent() encoded list of <td> values
[06:52:51] <limpc> im passing it back via: var data = { "data": JSON.stringify(myarray) }; $.ajax({ url: "/myurl.php", data: data, dataType: "json" });
[06:58:11] <limpc> any idea?
[06:58:20] <limpc> ive been fighting with this for hours.
[07:02:44] <Velveeta> your problem is that you're stringifying your array, and then passing ito to ajax as part of your data object
[07:03:17] <Velveeta> at the time it gets shipped, the ajax function is seeing that as a data object with a string property, and transporting it that way
[07:03:38] <Velveeta> don't stringify it first, just assign it as {"data": myarray}
[07:11:13] <limpc> apparently my problem was the client was using jquery 1.7.  it started working when i upgraded it to 1.10
[07:17:26] <kristofers> Hey can anyone help me figure out a way to alternative between floating my caption left and right
[07:17:48] <kristofers> It's a slider and i want to alternate on each slide
[07:20:39] <BillCriswell> kristofers: Which slider? Some have built in options for what transition to use for which slide.
[07:20:56] <kristofers> nivo slider
[07:21:08] <kristofers> problem is the caption is a div changed by jquery and not inside each div
[07:21:28] <kristofers> i was using a slider and i changed the class with php
[07:21:31] <kristofers> but can't do that now
[07:22:42] <kristofers> Or i can just change it to that i guess
[07:22:54] <kristofers> and keep doing it in php
[07:23:31] <BillCriswell> kristofers: http://docs.dev7studios.com/jquery-plugins/nivo-slider#jumpNav-5 Looking at this I'd play around with the "effect" option, but this one might not offer transition per slide functionality.
[07:24:20] <BillCriswell> kristofers: Nevermind. I read further down the page and saw this: http://docs.dev7studios.com/jquery-plugins/nivo-slider#jumpNav-8
[07:25:19] <BillCriswell> kristofers: So output the data-transition attributes with php alternating or loop through them before you initiate the slide.
[07:26:10] <BillCriswell> $('.slide').each(function(i){ $(this).data('transition', i % 2 === 0 ? 'slideInLeft' : 'slideInRight');
[07:29:35] <kristofers> i'm trying to float the caption of the slider either left of right, not the effects
[07:29:51] <kristofers> problem is how nivo slider works, it's updating the caption div in jquery
[07:29:59] <kristofers> even if i remove it in the html it adds it back
[07:30:45] <kristofers> i can probably change the code you sent, have it add a new param
[07:31:02] <kristofers> and change the float of the caption depending on the param of each slide
[07:37:31] <JoeyMe> Hi
[07:37:41] <JoeyMe> Need quick help with JQuery
[07:39:21] <JoeyMe> setInterval(function() {$('#clock').load('clock.php');}, 2000);
[07:39:34] <JoeyMe> how do I use that to load the same page to 2 different DIVs?
[07:39:43] <JoeyMe> I have it working on 1
[07:39:43] <Cork> you can't
[07:39:59] <JoeyMe> have to load the page each time?
[07:40:12] <Cork> also remember that setInterval isn't guaranteed to trigger every 2000 ms
[07:40:21] <JoeyMe> i knoe
[07:40:27] <JoeyMe> im using it to keep a balance correct
[07:40:28] <Cork> JoeyMe: use $.get() and html() it to the two divs
[07:40:31] <JoeyMe> every 10000 actually
[07:40:34] <slax0r> $('#yourotherselector').html($('#clock').html()); might do the trick
[07:40:49] <Cork> no cause .load is async
[07:40:52] <lenswipe> hey guys
[07:40:54] <lenswipe> can someone help me
[07:41:09] <slax0r> Cork: does load have a callback?
[07:41:09] <lenswipe> im trying to write a custom jquery plugin that simply wraps a jquery ui plugin
[07:41:12] <lenswipe> im not sure how to go about it though
[07:41:24] <lenswipe> i have some code with limited success
[07:41:35] <lenswipe> ...and when I say limited, I actually mean none
[07:41:35] <b-ot> lenswipe: I am not in limited,.
[07:41:38] <Cork> slacko: sure, but then you can just as well do it in a pure $.get
[07:41:44] <lenswipe> b-ot, wut?
[07:41:44] <b-ot> lenswipe: outlook good.
[07:41:48] <lenswipe> b-ot, wut?
[07:41:48] <Cork> JoeyMe: $.get().done(function(html) { $('#div1').html(html); $('#div2').html(html); })
[07:41:49] <b-ot> lenswipe: outlook good.
[07:41:53] <slax0r> true
[07:42:04] <lenswipe> b-ot, hello :-)
[07:42:17] <JoeyMe> Thanks
[07:48:35] <jost> I've got a slideshow on a webpage, a jquery plugin (bjqs). Now I want to do something everytime the slide is change, but the plugin doesn't offer a handler for that event. Is there a way to trigger an event everytime the "display"  css property changes? Or the style-attribute?
[07:48:46] <JoeyMe> you can load multiple div with the same load functiojn
[07:48:53] <JoeyMe> just seperate the DIV's with comma
[07:49:08] <lenswipe> also if I do $('p').plugin(); can I use "this" inside my plugin to get the 'p' selecteor
[07:50:35] <seutje> lenswipe: more like the resulting jQuery collection
[07:51:45] <lenswipe> either way doing this.hide() inside my plugin it will hide the elements i called the plugin on, correct?
[07:51:51] <lenswipe> $('a').hide(); like that
[08:01:47] <seutje> lenswipe: yeah
[08:02:57] <lenswipe> seutje, this project is using jquery impromptu and im trying to write a jquery plugin with the same name and method signature that just wraps jquery ui modal
[08:03:02] <lenswipe> seutje, suggestions?
[08:05:39] <seutje> not rly
[08:06:39] <seutje> xcept maybe "glwt!"
[08:14:31] <amcsi_work> hi
[08:15:12] <amcsi_work> how do I make sure an HTML string is properly closed before inserting it into the dom?
[08:15:23] <amcsi_work> I think there was a jquery method for it
[08:15:33] <Cork> nope
[08:16:06] <Cork> that would require a validation feature and that isn't cheap
[08:16:50] <amcsi_work> I think it was related to making a dangling div tag, inserting the html string into it, then grabbing the innerHTML of the dangling <div>
[08:17:20] <Cork> amcsi_work: well ya that is serializing a dom tree
[08:17:27] <Cork> not encuring the html is valid
[08:17:43] <Cork> the error correction isn't even guaranteed to do the correct thing
[08:18:04] <Cork> but yes $('<div>').html(html).html() would do what you just said
[08:18:23] <amcsi_work> that's what I meant
[08:18:27] <amcsi_work> thx
[08:20:46] <amcsi_work> is it possible to turn an html string into a jquery object in a simple way?
[08:21:06] <Cork> $(html) pre 1.9
[08:21:18] <Cork> and $/($.parseHTML(html)) is 1.9+
[08:21:25] <Cork> * $($.parseHTML(html)) is 1.9+
[08:23:39] <amcsi_work> thx
[08:23:41] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[08:24:34] <bobdobbs> I'm using chrome dev tools. How can I tell if an html element has an event attached to it from a js script?
[08:25:58] <bobdobbs> Like, I can see the 'Event Listeners' accordion tab under the inspector. But it gives a whole pile of information. Too much for my eyes. Is there a way to use that tab to quickly find events added from js?
[08:30:51] <sacho_> The Event Listeners tab shows event listeners added via js.
[08:31:21] <Jon47> bobdobbs: not really, i assume you're using some framework to bind event listeners?
[08:32:46] <bobdobbs> Jon47: hi. Yeah. I'm playing around with zepto and the stuff on this page: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/events
[08:33:49] <bobdobbs> I just remember a while ago, I hit a particular problem. And it would have been really useful to find which event handlers were bound to a particular elements click event
[08:34:42] <bobdobbs> Like, the app was using different plugins. They were trying to do the same thing at the same time to the same element on a click event.
[08:35:16] <Jon47> you can also set the debugger to kick in at certain times
[08:35:30] <bobdobbs> using 'debug' or somesuch?
[08:36:16] <Jon47> debugger; // in javascript
[08:36:27] <Jon47> or you can create DOM breakpoints in Dev Tools
[08:36:36] <bobdobbs> right
[08:36:47] <bobdobbs> I've played with those. but I haven't gotten really nimble
[08:37:11] <Jon47> or event listener breakpoints
[08:38:06] <Jon47> unfortunately when you use frameworks that means a lot of code that you're not familiar with is going to be executed, that's a fact of the browser world right now
[08:38:25] <Jon47> and the browser can't be expected to distinguish the stuff you wrote vs the libraries you just included to make your life easier
[08:38:38] <bobdobbs> right
[08:38:45] <Jon47> my advise is get real comfy with the debugger
[08:38:51] <bobdobbs> hehe. yeah
[08:38:57] <Jon47> learn to step through the code or scan the stack trace and pick out the stuff that's releent
[08:38:59] <Jon47> *relevant
[08:38:59] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/P74vP/
[08:39:03] <bobdobbs> soooo much to learn in the debugger alone!
[08:39:28] <Jon47> Yep
[08:39:30] <Bloomberg> Guys why I get the " $(...).fullcalendar is not a function "?
[08:39:32] <Jon47> so much power.
[08:39:37] <bobdobbs> indeed!
[08:40:07] <Cork> Bloomberg: cause you have't loaded the plugin that defines fullcalender
[08:40:08] <Jon47> Bloomberg: you didn't include any external scripts, it looks like you need, at the very least, jquery plus this fullcalendar plugin
[08:40:26] <Bloomberg> Yes I have it loadeed in the main html view!
[08:40:33] <Jon47> not in the fiddle
[08:40:43] <Cork> Bloomberg: after you load jquery?
[08:40:58] <Bloomberg> later!
[08:41:02] <Cork> Bloomberg: and the browser is actually loading the script?
[08:41:08] <Bloomberg> yes
[08:42:02] <Bloomberg> Is that I had the needed of to set a selection list with differents options. and according that options selected load the function with new data
[08:42:04] <Cork> check so you arn't loading two versions of jqeury then
[08:43:28] <BillCriswell> Ugh, mobile inputs and their weird ass focusing behavoirs are driving me nuts.
[08:43:54] <BillCriswell> behaviors even
[08:45:06] <lenswipe> seutje, so im writing this plugin and im trying to call this inside the plugin and its saying "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'html' " in the console
[08:45:28] <Cork> lenswipe: you are trying to run jquery commands on a dom element
[08:45:28] <lenswipe> seutje, if i call $('p').plugin(); i want to be able to get the selector inside the plugin
[08:45:42] <lenswipe> Cork, I know, but how do I change that? Just wrap it in jquery?
[08:45:48] <lenswipe> ie: $(this) instead of this ?
[08:45:48] <Cork> yes
[08:45:51] <lenswipe> o
[08:45:52] <lenswipe> ok
[08:46:22] <lenswipe> and now im getting cannoy read property display of undefined
[08:46:24] <lenswipe> :{
[08:47:16] <Cork> O_o
[08:49:26] <lenswipe> Cork, https://gist.github.com/461c98edc09627b65050
[08:49:30] <lenswipe> that's my plugin code
[08:49:45] <Bloomberg> Cork: What do you suggest me for load a function with differents values each one time?
[08:50:07] <Cork> lenswipe: $(function(){ is messing things up for you
[08:50:37] <Bloomberg> I have this  ::::  $("#segde form").change(function(){ 					displayTableCallendar(loadchanges);
[08:50:47] <lenswipe> Cork, oh, really?
[08:50:48] <Cork> Math.random() ?
[08:50:54] <lenswipe> I read that was the correct way to do it from the jquery docs
[08:50:55] <lenswipe> but ok
[08:51:14] <Cork> lenswipe: when you call things yes, but not in the call functions
[08:51:23] <lenswipe> ah okay
[08:51:30] <Cork> lenswipe: this won't be a reference to the jquery object
[08:51:37] <seutje> wtf, u put a doc rdy in a plugin declaration?
[08:51:39] <Cork> and that is breaking everything for you
[08:51:47] <Cork> ya...
[08:52:15] * seutje tilts his head 90¬∫
[08:52:38] <seutje> lenswipe: within a plugin, this is already a jQuery collection
[08:52:58] <seutje> so you can just go all return this.html(...).dialog({...});
[08:53:00] <Bloomberg> How can I include a file jav inside the same javascript
[08:53:03] <Bloomberg> some like require!
[08:53:12] <lenswipe> seutje, I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but okay
[08:53:18] <lenswipe> my head is quite thick with cold
[08:53:19] <lenswipe> :(
[08:53:27] <seutje> lenswipe: you don't need to wrap it in $()
[08:53:38] <seutje> and you can do it all in 1 chain
[08:53:41] <lenswipe> okay
[08:53:44] <Cork> Bloomberg: natively you can't
[08:53:45] <lenswipe> so I dont need $(this) ?
[08:53:51] <seutje> noh
[08:54:00] <Cork> lenswipe: not when this is the jquery object
[08:54:11] <lenswipe> I'm quite confused then, sorry
[08:54:12] <Bloomberg> Cork: you understand what need i to do?
[08:54:15] <Cork> lenswipe: the ready wrapper replaced this with window
[08:54:25] <Cork> Bloomberg: yes, you want to load a script from another script?
[08:54:30] <lenswipe> okay but I don't have a ready wrapper in my plugin
[08:54:39] <Cork> Bloomberg: $.getScropt() is one option
[08:55:00] <Cork> lenswipe: and then this will be a reference to the jquery object, and no need to call $() on it
[08:55:13] <lenswipe> okay
[08:55:26] <lenswipe> Cork, so lines 3 and 4 can just be "this" not $(this)
[08:55:44] <Cork> lenswipe: yes
[08:55:46] <lenswipe> okay
[08:55:54] <Cork> lenswipe: also relember this can be a set of elements
[08:56:03] <Cork> so you might or might not do an .each loop there
[08:56:04] <lenswipe> right
[08:56:10] <Cork> depending on what the plugin should do
[08:56:29] <Cork> *not want to do
[08:56:46] <lenswipe> Cork, im replacing jquery impromptu which isn't working with the newest jquery ui with a function that works the same way that just wraps jquery ui modal
[08:57:48] <lenswipe> Cork, so you're saying that potentially this could be a collection
[08:57:53] <Cork> yes
[08:57:54] <lenswipe> so I might want a foreach on it
[08:57:56] <lenswipe> ...okay
[08:58:04] <Jayflux> hi jquery, when setting jsonp to talk i still get a querystring attatched to the url
[08:58:08] <Jayflux> :(
[08:58:10] <Jayflux> how can i remove the query string
[08:58:20] <Cork> $('selector') this in the plugin is exactly the same as var this = $('selector'); (except you can't do that)
[08:58:21] <Jayflux> to false*
[08:58:52] <Cork> Jayflux: "to talk"?
[08:58:58] <Jayflux> Cork:  read up
[08:59:04] <Jayflux> I did correct myself
[08:59:30] <Cork> Jayflux: well if your talking about ajax it is about get or post not jsonp
[08:59:56] <Cork> *you're
[09:00:10] <Jayflux> hmm i could try post
[09:00:33] <Cork> Jayflux: though remember you can't do post jsonp cross domains
[09:00:41] <Jayflux> how can i do this then?
[09:00:50] <Cork> remove the data from the request
[09:00:54] <Cork> or leave the query string
[09:00:57] <Cork> no other option
[09:01:04] <Jayflux> Theres no data on it
[09:01:12] <Jayflux> the query string is the jsonCallback
[09:01:13] <Cork> hmm
[09:01:19] <Cork> ah
[09:01:25] <Cork> how are you doing the call?
[09:01:28] <lenswipe> Cork, I tried the foreach and it doesn't sem to be executing
[09:01:28] <lenswipe> https://gist.github.com/461c98edc09627b65050
[09:01:35] <Jayflux> jsonpCallback: 'realtimeCallback',
[09:02:09] <Jayflux> and i have this on the url ?_=1383062245763
[09:03:14] <lenswipe> Jayflux, that's a unix timestamp i belive
[09:03:23] <Cork> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/7rR4y/1/
[09:04:00] <Cork> Jayflux: set cache: true
[09:04:15] <lenswipe> Cork, nada
[09:04:30] <Cork> Jayflux: what you see there is the cache circumvention used to try to work around the browsers cache
[09:04:53] <Cork> lenswipe: not even the console.log ?
[09:04:59] <lenswipe> nope
[09:05:00] <lenswipe> nothing
[09:06:06] <merin> join /#php
[09:06:07] <Jayflux> Thanks Cork
[09:06:24] <Cork> lenswipe: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/7rR4y/2/
[09:06:31] <lenswipe> Corey, console.log(this) produces this: https://gist.github.com/2c0dc22bb459f578a85b
[09:12:03] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[09:12:28] <lenswipe> Bloomberg, ....
[09:12:38] <Bloomberg> How can I clean first the content of a div, because is adding me new content over the old content
[09:12:50] <lenswipe> try .append?
[09:12:58] <lenswipe> $('div').append("Poop");
[09:13:27] <jphase> Bloomberg: .empty
[09:13:44] <Bloomberg> Yes i know that will work, but in this case the function is $("#my_selector").fullcalendar();
[09:14:55] <Bloomberg> .empty works perfect
[09:14:58] <Bloomberg> Thanks you so much!!
[09:15:01] <Bloomberg> thank*
[09:15:03] <jphase> np
[09:15:45] <Velveeta> also, you don't ever want to append Poop to something, because Poop is gross
[09:16:50] <lenswipe> Velveeta, append poop to a windows box
[09:16:52] <lenswipe> it will only improve it
[09:17:03] <jphase> lulz
[09:17:14] <Velveeta> i could say the same about a mac, tbh :D
[09:17:17] <lenswipe> and linux
[09:17:24] <lenswipe> I hate all platforms for different reasons
[09:17:59] <Velveeta> there is but 1 os, and its name is punch card
[09:18:14] <lenswipe> Velveeta, nope - apple already patented that
[09:18:21] <Velveeta> iPunchCard
[09:18:25] <lenswipe> it's the most stable form of storage ever
[09:18:31] <lenswipe> this changes things again again again again again
[09:18:51] <jphase> I like a unix/linux based terminal. I don't like using a website to tell a client where their MX record is pointed to :\
[09:18:51] <lenswipe> - made of natural paper
[09:18:54] <lenswipe> - 100% natural
[09:19:05] <lenswipe> - compatible with all desks out of the box
[09:19:08] <lenswipe> - doesn't get pc viruses
[09:19:32] <jphase> btw, I h8 that "PC" is somehow associated with Windows
[09:19:54] <Velveeta> indeed
[09:19:56] <lenswipe> jphase, +1
[09:20:08] <lenswipe> linux mac and windows are all PCs unless they are servers
[09:20:18] <lenswipe> ..but who the fuck would have a mac as a server, seriously
[09:20:40] <Velveeta> to be fair, macs could be construed as a lifestyle choice vs a personal computer
[09:20:42] <jphase> I mean, if we were gonna get all proprietary we should call a "PC" a Xerox or IBM computer hehe
[09:20:51] <Velveeta> at least, if you look at any of the fanboys i know
[09:21:07] <bberry_> If you have an ajax call where dataType: 'json', i assume the return data has already been parsed and is an object from the json text?
[09:21:07] <lenswipe> Velveeta, along with skinny jeans, caramel latte frapuccino, vinyl and a douchey attitude
[09:21:14] <jphase> heh, it just got politically nerdy in here
[09:21:43] <Velveeta> i'll never understand the fixation with vinyl‚Ä¶ it doesn't sound better, i don't care what the hipster audiophiles say :D
[09:22:13] <bberry_> Velveeta: Maybe they like the scratchiness? idk
[09:22:18] <Velveeta> on that note, <puts on his seinfeld voice> what's the deal with minecraft, anyway?! have we really come all this way to decide that 8-bit blocks are the height of gaming technology?!
[09:22:29] <bberry_> lol
[09:22:51] <lenswipe> +1
[09:22:59] <jphase> well it's definitely the FLAC of analog so I understand it a bit. Most ex-dj's prefer it
[09:23:27] <Ankhwatcher> hey! is there a jquery mobile channel?
[09:23:33] <Velveeta> you remember in old reel to reel footage where you could see the little hairs on the screen?
[09:23:34] <jphase> Ankhwatcher: this is it
[09:23:42] <Velveeta> i can hear those audio hairs on the record
[09:23:45] <Velveeta> it's disgusting
[09:23:51] <jphase> haha, yeah reel 2 reel ftw lol
[09:24:01] <Ankhwatcher> ah good
[09:26:32] <lenswipe> Velveeta, only on old vinyl
[09:26:37] <lenswipe> new vinyl is better quality
[09:26:43] <lenswipe> the problem is it degrades very very quickly
[09:26:50] <lenswipe> </hipster voice>
[09:26:53] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:27:28] <jphase> yeah, my mp3's don't melt in the sun
[09:27:34] <jphase> but I still <3 some vinyl
[09:28:31] <lenswipe> so yeah if im writing a jquery plugin and i call this inside the plugin
[09:28:39] <lenswipe> im trying to return the selector that the plugin was called on
[09:28:56] <Ankhwatcher> could I define a ListItem in a html file and have jquery copy it and put it into listview?
[09:29:23] <lenswipe> https://gist.github.com/b114d61e26260e647bab
[09:30:53] <nettoweb> guys, I'm creating a comment form (name, email, message and send button), I'm hiding all except message and when clicking in message box, I show other fields, but when I click outside message box, the other elements disappear too, because I'm using blu/focus on message box, is there a way to prevent this to occur?
[09:32:48] <bberry_> how do people here feel about using framesets to construct your website
[09:33:16] <jphase> lenswipe: this.selector should work I believe
[09:33:18] <lenswipe> bberry_, no.
[09:33:25] <lenswipe> jphase, ill try it
[09:33:27] <jphase> oh wait
[09:33:30] <jphase> that's deprecated I forgot
[09:33:45] <jphase> erm, Velveeta might know
[09:34:00] <Velveeta> <reading back>
[09:34:20] <bberry_> lenswipe: My coworker is using them.  I dont know why, because it is frustrating and confusing.  are there any functional problems with it so i can convince him not to?
[09:34:51] <lenswipe> bberry_, how about the fact that it makes it impossible to link to any pages on your site
[09:35:11] <jphase> frames are very 1990
[09:35:17] <jphase> ajax ftw :D
[09:35:36] <jphase> hell, .load even if it's on the same domain hehe
[09:35:54] <bberry_> wow
[09:35:55] <bberry_> hmmk
[09:35:56] <lenswipe> and the fact that the resulting site will not be responsive
[09:35:58] <slax0r> get your ajax to work when the client isn't executing js :P
[09:36:03] <lenswipe> seriously - frames....not even once.
[09:36:07] <bberry_> hahaha
[09:36:08] <lenswipe> []_[]
[09:36:13] <NoiseEee> bberry_: they've been deprecated for coming up on 10 years i think
[09:36:17] <lenswipe> [x]_[x]
[09:36:47] <nicetry> Hello.  I have a span inside a div.  each have a .on(click, '.respective-class', function(){}) events attached to them that lead users to different places.  However I can't figure out how to NOT have the div's on-click fire when someone clicks on the span.  Any suggestions?
[09:37:22] <jphase> bberry_: if he HAS to load content from another page all lazy-like, tell him to use $('div').load('yourfile.html');  or something.
[09:37:25] <slax0r> when you click the span, you in turn click also the dif
[09:37:27] <slax0r> div*
[09:37:46] <nicetry> being that the span is inside the div.
[09:38:12] <nicetry> I tried useing :not(.spans-class), and also e.stopPropogation, neither worked...
[09:38:47] <nicetry> slax0r: Is there a way to prevent the click on the div?
[09:38:56] <jphase> nicetry: stopPropagation should work on a child div. You have code samples?
[09:39:09] <slax0r> jphase: div is a parent
[09:39:24] <nicetry> jphase: I'll throw something together.
[09:39:31] <jphase> div/span/element/whatevs
[09:39:44] <jphase> teh childrenz
[09:39:52] <Velveeta> lenswipe: what jphase said was pretty much correct, you could assign your jquery-wrapped node to a var, and then inside your plugin reference varName.selector to get the original selector‚Ä¶ i don't think there's a native way from inside the plugin to get it, as the $.fn functions are executed in the context of the node itself, without any jquery data
[09:40:16] <Velveeta> so it would have to be something you assigned to a var externally and then referenced inside the plugin function‚Ä¶ additionally, as jphase said, it's been deprecated, as of 1.7
[09:40:17] <jphase> Velveeta: isn't .selector deprecated now though?
[09:40:21] <Velveeta> yepyep
[09:40:24] <jphase> oh *foot in mouth*
[09:40:27] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:40:41] <slax0r> yours or his?
[09:40:46] <Velveeta> the recommended way of getting that information is to pass it in as a parameter: http://api.jquery.com/selector/
[09:40:48] <lenswipe> Velveeta,
[09:40:48] <lenswipe> <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:40:50] <lenswipe> oops
[09:40:54] <lenswipe> Velveeta, https://gist.github.com/367c98df9f6853d35cbf
[09:41:00] <lenswipe> that's my plugin so far
[09:41:15] <lenswipe> i feel like im battering my head against the wall here
[09:41:17] <jphase> yeah, pass as param would be best for future proofing
[09:41:32] <Velveeta> yeah i don't think this.selector should exist in that context, as it's passing in the element itself as 'this', and the element itself doesn't have any idea what constructor was used to create that jquery object
[09:41:52] <lenswipe> Velveeta, well $(this) doesn't work, this doesn't work so I'm literally grasping at straws here
[09:42:03] <intellix> people using head.js.... is it possible to do .js() and an array of scripts?
[09:42:06] <lenswipe> Velveeta, so I appeal to you....wat do.
[09:42:18] <Velveeta> 'this' should work just fine
[09:42:35] <Velveeta> functions in the $.fn namespace are executed w/ the context of the node(s) that they were chained off of
[09:42:54] <Velveeta> actually, i'm smoking crack on part of what i said
[09:43:10] <Velveeta> "this" inside the function is actually representative of the jquery collection they were chained off of
[09:43:28] <Velveeta> so this.selector probably would be a viable property name in older versions of jquery, but you shouldn't use it
[09:43:43] <Velveeta> you should just do this.dialog
[09:44:28] <Velveeta> return this.each(someFunctionThatDoesWhatYouWant);
[09:45:13] <nicetry> slax0r and jphase -- http://jsfiddle.net/nua9C/
[09:46:39] <jphase> nicetry: http://jsfiddle.net/nua9C/1/
[09:46:51] <jphase> bind an additional click event to that child el
[09:48:30] <nicetry> ah
[09:48:31] <nicetry> http://jsfiddle.net/nua9C/2/
[09:48:36] <nicetry> just had to separate them
[09:48:41] <nicetry> thanks!
[09:52:31] <guideX> jquery chosen isn't working on iphone, any ideas?
[09:54:44] <jphase> hmm, rly?
[09:54:55] * jphase downloads an iOS simulator
[09:56:48] <jphase> guideX: ahh yeah, like the autocomplete portion you mean? Looks like iOS treats it as a regular select element
[09:57:57] <jphase> guideX: looks like they're unsupported for now https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/pull/1388
[09:57:58] <b-ot> jphase: Pull request #1388 by koenpunt (3mon 1w ago): Disable Chosen on iOS devices (iPad, iPod, iPhone)
[09:58:06] <adjo> won't that just be because of how phones treat select elements?
[09:58:20] <Ankhwatcher> okay new plan, how do I create a JQuery Mobile Javascript listitem object?
[09:58:35] <jphase> yeah, iOS just takes over on all select elements
[10:02:10] <guideX> oic
[10:02:14] <guideX> hmm
[10:02:25] <guideX> but then even the dropdownlist has 0 items.. I wonder if there's a workaround
[10:02:30] <guideX> which doesn't involve pulling chosen
[10:03:01] <jphase> mine seems to have a dropdown list, is your select markup funny in any way?
[10:03:16] <guideX> hmm
[10:03:18] <guideX> let me check
[10:03:37] <jphase> mine is a standard single select with some optgroups
[10:03:39] <lenswipe> hey guys
[10:03:47] <lenswipe> can someone tell me how i make a jquery plugin that i can call without a selector?
[10:03:50] <guideX> nope looks fairly normal, i'll paste somewhere..
[10:03:55] <lenswipe> like $.alert() whatever
[10:04:26] <guideX> http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39654
[10:04:42] <guideX> but it says 0 items
[10:04:44] <jphase> lenswipe: you can just $.fn.something = function(){ //something }
[10:05:09] <lenswipe> jphase, im doing that
[10:05:23] <lenswipe> jphase, im trying to make a plugin that wraps jquery ui's dialog
[10:05:43] <lenswipe> jphase, the problem is that it requrest HTML to be present to begin with, so im trying to make it inject the HTML it needs into the page and then use that HTML
[10:05:47] <lenswipe> jphase, is this doable?
[10:05:54] <jphase> lenswipe: yeah if you need to reference an element you'll need to use the element, your method will call without one though
[10:06:04] <jphase> oh sure
[10:06:27] <jphase> just build it out $('<div>').dialog().appendTo($('body'))  or something
[10:06:42] <jphase> you'll still need a place to append/insert it though, which still references an element :\
[10:08:04] <jphase> guideX: try removing some of those styles and make a very plain/vanilla version of that select and see if that fixes it for iOS. If it does, remove one thing at a time
[10:08:18] <guideX> hmm ok
[10:08:20] <jphase> like just <select>
[10:08:27] <guideX> perhaps it is my manipulation of the select list
[10:08:35] <guideX> I am adding and removing, then calling chosen
[10:08:42] <guideX> as users click around
[10:08:47] <guideX> so maybe it's something like that
[10:09:31] <jphase> I'm doing the exact same thing right now, modifying the options dynamically and calling the "chosen:updated" event and iOS seems to still have my vals
[10:09:59] <guideX> oic hmm
[10:13:10] <lenswipe> jphase, https://gist.github.com/0bcfda33fd6fdb1c27d3 and https://gist.github.com/0bcfda33fd6fdb1c27d3
[10:13:38] <jphase> boddy?
[10:13:57] <jphase> must be one HAWT body tog to use 2 d's ;)
[10:14:48] <lenswipe> jphase, I didn't...
[10:15:00] <lenswipe> ffs - I did!
[10:15:01] <lenswipe> fuuuu
[10:15:10] <jphase> ;]
[10:15:13] <lenswipe> anyway, same error persists - Uncaught TypeError: Object function (e,n){return new x.fn.init(e,n,t)} has no method 'prompt'
[10:15:35] <jphase> lenswipe: firstly, don't use prompt cause that's a native js function name
[10:15:37] <guideX> jphase: were you using a multi select list
[10:15:49] <lenswipe> jphase, ....
[10:15:51] <jphase> guideX: not atm no, but it *should* be the same I'd think
[10:16:01] <guideX> hmm ok
[10:16:03] <lenswipe> jphase, im calling it prompt to replace another jquery plugin that doesn't work(impromptu)
[10:16:12] <jphase> lenswipe: that's probably not your issue cause it's a method not a standard function
[10:16:14] <guideX> I think the regular select list will work, but multiselect won't
[10:16:49] <jphase> guideX: lemme test, sec
[10:16:50] <guideX> the weird thing is, it should detect that it's an iphone and not load chosen
[10:17:07] <jphase> yeah, definitely shouldn't be loading chosen
[10:17:35] <jphase> you've confirmed it's still loading chosen?
[10:17:38] <guideX> yeah
[10:17:44] <jphase> hmmm o_O
[10:17:46] <guideX> here's some code where it detects iphone .. http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39655
[10:18:02] <guideX> in chosen.jquery.min
[10:18:07] <guideX> err .js
[10:18:09] <nardev> hello, if i put somename.init(); inside document.ready it works ok, but if i put that inside DOM's onclick="javascript:somename.init();" it doesn't work, what the hack i'm doing wrong?
[10:18:15] <nerder> hello
[10:18:25] <nerder> i'm looking for something like http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/inspiration/footer-designs-showcase/ number6
[10:18:29] <jphase> guideX: and you're using an actual iOS device or simulator I assume? Nothing funky?
[10:18:29] <nerder> someone can help me?
[10:18:44] <guideX> ios device
[10:18:54] <guideX> I have several versions, same thing :(
[10:19:34] <jphase> nerder: that's really more of a design question, not sure what that has to do with jQuery exactly. If you have a specific question regarding how to build something with jQuery, let us know ;)
[10:20:56] <jphase> nardev: don't use inline click events. Use .click(function(){   or  .on('click', function(){  in jQuery instead
[10:21:11] <lenswipe> jphase, any thoughts on my issue?
[10:21:36] <nardev> jphase, i just tried to declare that but it doesn't work ether :/
[10:23:20] <nardev> jphase, it's up to me
[10:26:12] <jphase> nardev: try creating a jsfiddle or something, we have no context
[10:26:14] <jphase> lenswipe: sec
[10:26:30] <nardev> jphase, i figured out thank you
[10:26:41] <nardev> it was wrong selector...
[10:27:20] <hlve> Alright. so I'm trying to remove the title of all checkboxes with a specific class after the page loads. The title is being applied by JQWidgets.
[10:27:21] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/wA26mFzM
[10:27:31] <hlve> Can someone look at this code and tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[10:27:52] <hlve> When it actually does work, it only seems to remove the first checkbox it finds, and doesn't remove all of the others.
[10:27:59] <jphase> lenswipe: oh that's right, you need to not use .fn in there to extend
[10:28:11] <hlve> Basically, JQWidgets is adding a title of 'True' on check, and 'False' on unchecked. It's driving me mad.
[10:28:16] <jphase> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/sYd3z/
[10:28:18] <lenswipe> oic
[10:28:31] <lenswipe> jphase, now i have Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined
[10:28:52] <jphase> lenswipe: well that's an entirely different issue, your function exists now though :D
[10:29:03] <lenswipe> jphase, well the thing is that error is coming from jquery-2.0.3.js:6350
[10:29:17] <hlve> ;/
[10:30:03] <jphase> lenswipe: make a jsfiddle and I can help debug
[10:31:02] <lenswipe> jphase, http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=LdrvsdLoik
[10:31:33] <hlve> anybodys?
[10:32:24] <NoiseEee> hey, i have a question about a callback in jquery plugins: https://gist.github.com/NoiseEee/7219117
[10:33:21] <Whiskey> Checkout this http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/1/
[10:33:30] <Whiskey> it should only toggle if i click on the text, not the images
[10:35:29] <Whiskey> not sure what i did wrong
[10:36:05] <ngharo> Whiskey: you're <em> contains the image
[10:36:09] <ngharo> close it before your img tag
[10:36:27] <jedimind> or adjust your selector
[10:36:37] <jedimind> to not be .ViewLink, but rahter ".ViewLink .Text"
[10:36:41] <jedimind> or something to that effect
[10:36:47] <jedimind> although this feels over engineered
[10:36:50] <Whiskey> it is closed
[10:37:04] <ngharo> click events bubble up
[10:37:25] <ngharo> so anything inside your selector that is clicked will trip it
[10:39:18] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/3/ <---that should be correct html
[10:39:35] <hlve> :(
[10:40:29] <Whiskey> complicated :/
[10:40:41] <mdev> $('tr':odd).css({backgroundColor: '#ccc'});
[10:40:44] <mdev> what's wrong with that?
[10:40:57] <mdev> is complaining about the : i'm assuming after the tr
[10:41:11] <mdev> that's suppose to change the odd table columns to the specified color
[10:41:23] <pragma-> its outside the quotes
[10:41:33] <ngharo> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/4/
[10:41:48] <mdev> err should have tested that
[10:41:50] <mdev> thanks brother
[10:42:41] <Whiskey> thats wrong :)
[10:43:04] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/1/ <-- you see that change the text when you toggle, your one miss that
[10:47:46] <Whiskey> funny that is broken :/
[10:50:31] <ngharo> Whiskey: move the ID up -- http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/8/
[10:51:14] <Whiskey> yeh thats correct
[10:52:56] <mdev> I wonder how much jsfiddle author makes
[10:52:58] <mdev> off the site
[10:52:59] <Whiskey> ngharo, its actully going to be a problem
[10:53:57] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/10/ <-- thats how its going to be the images not going to be inside that divs, i should have told that, did not really think about it
[10:54:29] <Whiskey> but it should be some easy way to find it whit class name, as those are only in the images and text
[10:56:36] <ngharo> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/11/
[10:57:52] <NoiseEee> hey, i have a question about a callback in jquery plugins: https://gist.github.com/NoiseEee/7219117
[10:58:49] <sunbeam> I need to use .mouseleave on a .class that is added after page is loaded
[10:58:51] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[10:58:59] <teufelChiCoder> hi everyone, im using https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine for validations, but keep getting an "error" popup when its used no a slider?
[10:59:14] <teufelChiCoder> anone familiar how to set it up for a slider?
[10:59:22] <Whiskey> nice :)
[10:59:29] <Whiskey> hope i can get it work in my code :D
[11:07:36] <hlve> I hate jqwidgets
[11:07:38] <hlve> I really do
[11:13:35] <Whiskey> It can¬¥t find it
[11:14:07] <Bloomberg> Guys !!
[11:14:15] <Bloomberg> With $.getScript();
[11:14:25] <Bloomberg> Can I set more than one file?
[11:14:52] <ngharo> $.getScript(file1); $.getScript(file2);
[11:14:56] <ngharo> so no :)
[11:15:33] <Whiskey> Can¬¥t the <em class="ViewLink"> be anywhere?
[11:15:45] <Whiskey> or does it exactly have the divs and crap thats in the example ngharo
[11:16:16] <ngharo> could be anywhere
[11:16:37] <ngharo> but the click is bound to it so make sure it contains whatever you want clicked to trigger the action
[11:25:07] <nafta> Hello, I really hope that someone could give me a hand..
[11:25:24] <nafta> this is my code -> http://pastebin.com/DQ4Pck4X
[11:25:51] <nafta> Basically...what I'm trying to do...is...updating the text in the class="header-points"
[11:25:58] <nafta> to the points currently won
[11:26:41] <Whiskey> strange can¬¥t get it to work
[11:27:49] <nafta> My code is correctly writing to the database
[11:27:55] <nafta> but I can't get the points to update lively
[11:32:26] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Did you get it figured out?
[11:32:45] <guideX> any idea why ::before stops working with html5 doctype?
[11:33:41] <BillCriswell> guideX: I never used before. Does :before work?
[11:33:53] <guideX> yeah
[11:34:08] <BillCriswell> Hmm... ::before
[11:34:12] <guideX> it's like css3 #mytype::before {
[11:34:17] <guideX> it's like tooltip functionality
[11:34:29] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yep thanks
[11:34:58] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Sweeet.
[11:35:47] <BillCriswell> guideX: Not sure why it wouldn't. Can't just switch to :before?
[11:37:15] <nafta> anyone could take a look at my code?
[11:37:18] <nafta> thanks
[11:37:29] <nafta> http://pastebin.com/DQ4Pck4X
[11:37:34] <nafta> I'm trying to update the points
[11:37:37] <nafta> lively
[11:37:42] <nafta> but...I can't seem to figure it out
[11:44:43] <mdev> jquery is pretty awesome, wish I had learned it earlier
[11:45:15] <mdev> I was trying to do everything in javascript straight, and while possible there are far less examples than jquery and jquery simplifies tons of stuff drastically
[11:45:31] <mdev> whoever created it should get a big fat check
[11:47:34] <BillCriswell> mdev: https://jquery.org/donate/ sure they'd all appreciate it haha
[11:48:42] <clime> hey anyone experienced with jquery-file-upload plugin? Ihave a question regarding use of name files[] for the input.Why files[] when one filename is always sent?
[11:49:14] <clime> *one file  not one filename, i meant
[11:51:24] <clime> e.g. as shown here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin
[11:51:38] <clime> they call the input files[] and I don't get why
[11:56:45] <BillCriswell> clime: If you put a multiple attribute in there does the plugin still work?
[11:58:13] <clime> BillCriswell: I have got a working example where the input looks like this: <input id="fileupload" type="file" name="file" multiple>
[11:58:46] <BillCriswell> clime: It's so there would be an array of files instead of just one if I'm understnading you right
[11:59:34] <Erston> i am trying to create a typewriter effect, can any recommend?
[12:00:32] <BillCriswell> Erston: http://jsbin.com/araget/5/edit seems nice.
[12:01:45] <michelem> hello folks
[12:02:14] <clime> BillCriswell: I well even if there is multiple option it does send a request for each file separately so I don't get why it should be array if always one file is received by server at a time
[12:02:24] <michelem> http://jsfiddle.net/3d2u7/ I get an "undefined" in the alert on line 84 here. The code is so trivial, what is it?
[12:02:51] <BillCriswell> clime: I'm not sure if it does one at a time or not. Never really played with it to be honest.
[12:03:31] <clime> BillCriswell: ye a pity their demo page is not working
[12:03:34] <michelem> forget about that, the id was named with #
[12:04:38] <BillCriswell> michelem: Okie doke.
[12:04:52] <BillCriswell> clime: Did you download it and tyr it out
[12:05:12] <clime> BillCriswell: sure, i have a working demo
[12:06:20] <clime> BillCriswell: but in that demo, they use name="file" as I would expect. I would just like to understand why they use files[] in docs because to me it seems weird.
[12:06:48] <BillCriswell> clime: Because it's uploading multiple files.
[12:07:29] <Erston> thx
[12:07:32] <Erston> lots of code in that example
[12:07:34] <clime> BillCriswell: ok but just one file is always in that array, ok perhaps it's like you say
[12:07:47] <Erston> nice though, will save that
[12:07:49] <BillCriswell> clime: You can hold control and choose multiple files.
[12:08:31] <clime> BillCriswell: even if you chose multiple files it uploads each file separately.
[12:09:57] <BillCriswell> clime: Yeah, but if it was just named "files" it would only get one file I imagine ( or none ).
[12:10:14] <Whiskey> i need help
[12:11:03] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/SDnh9/12/ <-- check that one and tell me when you have check the CSS

[12:13:44] <BillCriswell> So there's actually no issue with the link you posted?
[12:13:52] <Whiskey> Well no but i have it in a diffrent code
[12:14:01] <Whiskey> i get everything to work espect when i change to image it won¬¥t show the image
[12:14:42] <Whiskey> thinked it maybe esyer to see it in the real code i use'
[12:15:00] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone know a good plugin for horizontal scrolling?
[12:15:06] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Inspect the element in your developers tools.
[12:15:40] <Whiskey> i have check recheck and yeh
[12:15:44] <Whiskey> i can¬¥t see any problem
[12:16:04] <Whiskey> if not the css block it but it reverse it so it can¬¥t be that ether
[12:16:35] <yakko_air> hey guys, I'm looking for a javascript library for templating, something that looks like the ng-property="last_name" things from angular, did you guys have any good experiences with any of those in particular?
[12:16:53] <jedimind> yakko_air underscore, mustache
[12:17:18] <Whiskey> so i have no clue what it can be
[12:17:24] <jedimind> yakko_air http://mustache.github.io/
[12:17:42] <jedimind> if youre looking for logicless templates, mustache is your bad boy
[12:18:29] <yakko_air> jedimind: hm, that's nice, I played with it in a hackaton app once
[12:18:44] <Whiskey> BillCriswell?
[12:19:01] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Not sure. Actually just got pulled into something at work.
[12:19:05] <shoky> yakko_air you might like knockout.js too if you want bindings similar to angular's
[12:19:15] <Whiskey> What you mean?
[12:19:48] <yakko_air> jedimind shoky: my real goal is to move the presenters logic to javascript and see if that will become a good practice of code, what do you guys think?
[12:20:03] <Whiskey> Somethings block it no clue what
[12:20:09] <jedimind> yakko_air i think you should just stick to angularjs :)
[12:21:09] <yakko_air> ... so that I mostly have my server language write a js object, I'm trying to make my views even dumber
[12:22:18] <Whiskey> actully found it
[12:22:54] <andrew9183> what up jedimind
[12:32:55] <jedimind> yo andrew9183
[12:37:16] <andrew9183> what up !
[12:38:17] <LeBlaaanc> anyone know of an infinite scroll jquery plugin? There's a pretty popular one I can't seem to find
[12:44:59] <ElysiumNet> anyone knows of a plugin that allows me to scale, rotate and transform an element?
[12:47:13] <jedimind> LeBlaaanc did you try google? its literally called "infinite scroll"
[12:47:28] <LeBlaaanc> jedimind: nah the one I was looking for is called waypoints
[12:47:37] <LeBlaaanc> had to look in my logs
[12:48:01] <jedimind> waypoints have nothing to do with infinite scroll
[12:48:02] <jedimind> but okay :)
[12:48:27] <LeBlaaanc> jedimind: well it has an example of infinite scroll so I'm not sure how that has nothing to do with infinite scrol.
[12:48:42] <jedimind> it also uses html and css
[12:48:48] <LeBlaaanc> nice
[12:48:48] <jedimind> but if i want to code some css, i dont download waypoints javascript plugin
[12:48:53] <jedimind> but okay
[12:48:57] <LeBlaaanc> ya brilliant comeback.
[12:49:07] <jedimind> waypoints literally doesnt include anything regarding infinite scroll
[12:49:13] <jedimind> they use an existing infinite scroll plugin from someone else
[12:49:16] <jedimind> in one of their examples.
[12:49:23] <jedimind> nothing more
[12:49:29] <jedimind> but you are clearly the smarter one
[12:50:34] <LeBlaaanc> indeed.
[13:00:14] <andywww> hello?

[13:15:56] <amh345> i've got an on click event on a button that changes the text in another button.  i've got an issue where i need to remove that copy that gets added. but i need to remove it using another js file.
[13:16:23] <amh345> i've got another on click event for that button in another js file- but it doesn't seem to pick it it.
[13:16:39] <amh345> is there a way to achieve this without touching the other js file?
[13:19:29] <BillCriswell> amh345: How is the on click event added?
[13:21:25] <amh345> BillCriswell: $("form").on("click",".delete_btn",function(){ 	$('a.add').each(function(){ // remove copy // }) ;});
[13:21:55] <BillCriswell> amh345: You should be able to do $('form').off('click');
[13:23:46] <BillCriswell> amh345: http://jsbin.com/AVakeKE/1/watch?js,output does work.
[13:26:12] <amh345> BillCriswell: thanks. I'm messing with it now. my function on the off("click",".delete_btn",function () {/// }  doesn't seem to be triggering.  i need to read up on .off
[13:26:37] <nafta> if I return echo true from PHP how can I check if data is true or false in jquery?
[13:27:44] <BillCriswell> nafta: Are you doing echo "true"; or echo true; ?
[13:27:53] <nafta> echo true
[13:29:19] <BillCriswell> When you visit this page what do you see? Just a 1?
[13:30:10] <BillCriswell> nafta: I mean.. I'd try to get it to return some JSON cause doing echo true; just seems weird.
[13:30:17] <amh345> BillCriswell: in your example. i never see console.log('First!'); in the console ?
[13:30:40] <BillCriswell> amh345: Yes. The off is removing the event listeners for click.
[13:31:37] <andywww> I've built a basic plugin and i'm using it more than once on a page
[13:31:38] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/80b5cecd86d8812385f1
[13:32:06] <andywww> i want to trigger a function of each instance
[13:32:43] <nafta> BillCriswell: what if I make it return a var with a value... I wanna know the syntax to evaluate that value inside jquery something like .done(function(data) { if (value == "true") {alert("yay!");}else{alert("boo");}  }); ?
[13:32:57] <nafta> is it correct?
[13:33:23] <BillCriswell> nafta: Yeah, but instead of value == "true" you'd want to use data.
[13:33:28] <andywww> how do i run: $(window).on('resize.carousel', resize); on each instance of the carousel?
[13:33:34] <BillCriswell> data will be the response from whatever you requested.
[13:34:05] <nafta> so if in my php I have echo "I am true"; data will equal that ?
[13:34:07] <nafta> the string?
[13:34:18] <BillCriswell> nafta: Yes.
[13:34:26] <nafta> so if data == "I am true" ?
[13:34:49] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:34:54] <nafta> nice let me check
[13:34:55] <nafta> thanks
[13:34:58] <amh345> BillCriswell: i think this is not what i need, sadly. it looks like that it's for removing events.
[13:36:20] <BillCriswell> amh345: You were just trying to prevent the callback from doing one thing in the whole body of the function?
[13:40:38] <nafta> BillCriswell: can you help me out with a selector question?
[13:40:38] <BillCriswell> amh345: Do you want to set the text back to what it was before the first one ran?
[13:41:05] <nafta> I have this -> var selectValue = $('.trivia-answer > select[name=select] > option:selected').val();   and I want to select...the data-filter within that selection...but in another var..
[13:41:16] <nafta> I don't know how the syntax goes tho
[13:41:22] <nafta> I mean..I don't know how to select it
[13:42:02] <BillCriswell> What is data-filter on?
[13:42:09] <nafta> it is a value
[13:42:11] <nafta> int
[13:42:18] <nafta> that I want to get to be able to send to php
[13:42:22] <nafta> oh
[13:42:34] <nafta> echo "<option value=\"1\" data-filter=".$triviaId.">".$result25['option_1']."</option>";
[13:42:38] <nafta> there..a select option
[13:44:01] <BillCriswell> nafta: So you want an option with data-filter=X to be selected?
[13:44:06] <amh345> BillCriswell: yes. i want to set it back to what it was. sorry, I'm trying to gist the code for both on events.  but a phone call came in :/  my apologize
[13:44:21] <nafta> no no...I just want to pass the value data-filter from the selected option
[13:44:28] <nafta> I want to store it a variable
[13:45:02] <BillCriswell> amh345: $('#foo').on('click', function(){ $(this).text('Hi'); }); $('#foo').on('click', function(){ $(this).text('Bye'); });  like that?
[13:45:34] <ElysiumNet> anyone here knows of a plugin that allows the manipulation of multiple elements?
[13:45:43] <BillCriswell> nafta: $('.trivia-answer > select[name=select] > option:selected').data('filter') should do what you need.
[13:45:52] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: jQuery?
[13:46:02] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: I mean something like an editor
[13:46:30] <ElysiumNet> so you can rotate/scale/move elements, and also multiple elements at one
[13:46:32] <ElysiumNet> *once
[13:47:02] <BillCriswell> ElysiumNet: Not sure. I'd just play around in the dev tools I guess.
[13:47:11] <BillCriswell> Don't do it often enough to be useful here though.
[13:52:08] <andywww> i have a plugin which i have used multiple times on a page, i'd like to run a function in each of the instanced on window resize but its only effecting the last instance
[13:52:26] <andywww> i can see this is a common problem from googling but haven't been able to solve it
[13:52:45] <andywww> could someone help me out?

[13:56:19] <Warpten|Code> Hi, is there any reason why I cannot retrieve the onmouseover property of a dom node as a string? It's declared as in-line html property
[14:00:06] <BillCriswell> Warpten|Code: Just tried it out and it seemed to work OK
[14:00:26] <Warpten|Code> Interesting
[14:00:55] <Warpten|Code> (Web scraping)  I'll spoof this site's jquery, just to try
[14:00:55] <BillCriswell> Warpten|Code: http://jsbin.com/ununase/1/edit?html,js,output My test.
[14:09:38] <thin> I have a function that contains other function that contains other functions. When i try to use one of those nested function with $(document).ready() the `this` value is wrong. What can I do about that?
[14:10:40] <Husar> 123
[14:10:59] <amh345> BillCriswell: here is a piece of the code http://jsbin.com/AmAsaqAh/2/edit
[14:11:42] <amh345> basically, in file1 $('body').on('click', '.delete_btn', function(e) { }); triggers adding "add" again to the html text.  but i need to not have that ADD happen.
[14:12:14] <Husar> Hi, Im looking for any free Halloween script (flyaing pumpkin, bat etc) :D
[14:15:13] <BillCriswell> amh345: Ohhhhh
[14:16:56] <dabear> thin: save this to another variable. example: function foo(){   var self = this;  (function bar(){ /* self refers to the outer scope*/ })();    }; new Foo();
[14:17:22] <BillCriswell> I don't think you can keep it from adding the "add". You'll just have to remove the "add" when it's added. $('body').on('click', '.delete_btn', function(){ // Strip the "add" });
[14:17:55] <amh345> BillCriswell: that's what i tried originally in FILE2. but it didn't seem to pick up the strip
[14:19:32] <SolarBoom> Hi All, I have an implementation of Datepicker plugin, and highlight holidays and I want when user clicks on a holiday to show them holiday name
[14:19:55] <SolarBoom> I have no idea, please anyone help me
[14:20:45] <BillCriswell> amh345: http://jsbin.com/AmAsaqAh/3/edit?html,js,output this help?
[14:23:22] <nafta> BillCriswell: well bro...I've been fighting with this for almost 1 hour already...if you can see something that I can't I would appreciate it
[14:23:24] <nafta> http://pastebin.com/LJhkMLCZ
[14:23:29] <nafta> I'm not able to write to the database
[14:24:38] <BillCriswell> nafta: Any white space before <?php or after ?>. That can make the response " correct" or "correct ".
[14:25:02] <BillCriswell> You should really leave off the ending ?> since white spaced always sneak in after that asshole.
[14:25:13] <BillCriswell> I have to run though. Good luck!
[14:25:18] <nafta> ok thanks
[14:26:26] <Atlantic777> Hi! I've built something with jquery mobile and I have a piece of code where on every keyup event in that input box I check some data and refresh UI if data is correct.
[14:27:09] <Atlantic777> Now, my client moved actually to touch screen computer and wanted me to add a clear button, because they enter values with some kind of RFID reader and need a way to clear data without actual keyboard.
[14:27:41] <Atlantic777> The problem is I don't know to which event I should connect that callback for UI refresh/data-check/whatver.
[14:28:00] <Atlantic777> 'change' event on that text input field doesn't seem to work...
[14:28:10] <Atlantic777> Any other ideas?
[14:30:19] <Atlantic777> nah, a setTimeout() solved it
[14:32:33] <Warpten|Code> BillCriswell: issue was caused by old version of jquery on the page, spoofing it to 1.10 worked just fine
[14:35:09] <Erston> hello
[14:39:32] <Erston> i am trying to create a typewriter effect, writing multiple lines, i am unsure of what to do next, http://jsfiddle.net/RmP49/9/
[14:47:46] <sunbeam> I need to use .mouseleave() on a .class that is added after page is loaded
[14:47:46] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[14:48:04] <Velveeta> i don't believe hover events bubble
[14:48:18] <Velveeta> so you'd have to attach that handler at the time that element was injected into the page
[14:48:57] <nafta> Velveeta: god...I was praying for you to show up
[14:49:04] <Velveeta> lol
[14:49:26] <Velveeta> i'm nearly always online, if you say my name, my colloquy will ding at me and pop up a growl message
[14:49:41] <Velveeta> but i'm not necessarily always looking at my screen if someone comes up to me w/ a question or i'm in a meeting or something
[14:49:48] <Velveeta> so i may miss it, but most of the time, i see it
[14:50:01] <nafta> is this correctly evaluated? .done(function(data) { if(data=="correct"){ alert("correct"); } else{ alert("incorrect"); } });
[14:50:05] <nafta> oh alright
[14:50:17] <nafta> I'm getting always incorrect
[14:50:31] <Velveeta> well it depends on what's being sent to that function
[14:50:39] <nafta> I'm basically this is what I'm echoing from the php echo "correct"; or incorrect
[14:50:39] <bakers> I need a good cli based minify to put into my build process for minifying JS files. Any good suggestions?
[14:51:15] <Velveeta> bakers: if you're using grunt, uglify works like a charm
[14:51:58] <nafta> Velveeta: I'm just echoing strings from php
[14:52:09] <Velveeta> nafta: if you console.log(data) what does it show?
[14:52:15] <nafta> hold on
[14:52:24] <Velveeta> and what dataType are you passing to your ajax function?
[14:52:47] <Velveeta> also, i'm always gonna recommend that you output json vs static strings like that :D
[14:54:22] <sunbeam> Velveeta: how can i do that?
[14:54:55] <nafta> Velveeta: take a look at this
[14:54:56] <nafta> http://pastebin.com/SdCwQy4q
[14:54:58] <Velveeta> sunbeam: whatever function is injecting your content w/ that class you need a mouseleave event listener on, you'll need to attach the listener there also
[14:55:07] <nafta> thing is...it is writing correctly to the database...without issues
[14:55:24] <sunbeam> Velveeta: ok how can I do that? I add the new class with mouseover()
[14:55:38] <bakers> Velveeta: It has a command line option?
[14:55:51] <bakers> I just want "minify big_file.css > small.css"
[14:55:54] <Velveeta> nafta: and what's that console.log outputting?
[14:55:56] <bakers> something simple/stupid
[14:56:03] <nafta> Velveeta: nadda
[14:56:04] <nafta> zero
[14:56:07] <nafta> O_o
[14:56:37] <Velveeta> bakers: i'm not sure if it has command line options or not, but i would think so, using node
[14:56:47] <JFranks> If your JSON response data has this var objholder = JSON.parse({ "foo":"bar", "x":"y", "1":"ok" }); .. how would you deal with the numeric object name?  ... objholder.foo = bar .. objholder.1 = SyntaxError Unexpected Number
[14:57:31] <Velveeta> sunbeam: so wait, you have a mouseover function already attached to the element in question, which adds the class, and you just need a mouseleave function to remove the class, or what?
[14:57:44] <sunbeam> Velveeta: correct/
[14:57:51] <Velveeta> jFranks: objholder['1']
[14:58:12] <Velveeta> sunbeam: just attach that listener at the same place you attach the mouseover listener‚Ä¶.
[14:58:54] <JFranks> Velveeta: Yeah I tried it and got :  "        .. Let me try '2'
[14:59:35] <JFranks> Velveeta: Oh wait.. I R DUM.. Thanks!
[14:59:36] <Velveeta> nafta: i'm not sure
[14:59:42] <Velveeta> jfranks: no problem
[15:00:17] <Velveeta> nafta: what browser are you testing this in?
[15:00:30] <nafta> Velveeta: what can I add to my get function to get the json_encode data?
[15:00:37] <nafta> Velveeta: all of them
[15:00:57] <Velveeta> nafta: then check the actual server response that you're receiving, in chrome you can find the request on the network tab
[15:01:13] <Velveeta> in firefox, if you have firebug running, you can find it right in the console
[15:01:29] <nafta> Velveeta: is there a way to make that .get function to receive json_encoded data?
[15:01:51] <Velveeta> nafta: add a dataType: 'json' parameter to it
[15:02:02] <Velveeta> you can try adding dataType: 'html' and see if it'll work with the current method
[15:02:15] <Velveeta> by default, it tries to intelligently guess what data type it's getting if you don't specify
[15:02:19] <Velveeta> so it may just be guessing wrong
[15:02:56] <nafta> Velveeta: $.get("checkTrivia.php", { "selectValue" : selectValue, "selectTriviaId" : selectTriviaId }, dataType: 'json')
[15:02:58] <nafta> like that?
[15:03:01] <nafta> it won't let me run it
[15:03:04] <nafta> hrm
[15:03:15] <nafta> Unexpected string
[15:03:17] <nafta> O_o
[15:03:23] <nafta> oh syntax error
[15:04:11] <Velveeta> sorry, on the $.get function, dataType is its own parameter at the end
[15:04:19] <Velveeta> just pass 'json' as your last parameter
[15:04:34] <Velveeta> if you're using $.ajax, you'd pass it as a key/value pair, dataType: 'json'
[15:07:50] <Velveeta> ok, i'm about to take off from work and it'll be a good hour and a half before i hit the house
[15:07:59] <Velveeta> so if you have any other questions, now would be the tiem
[15:08:01] <Velveeta> time*
[15:08:19] <nafta> Velveeta:
[15:08:23] <Velveeta> yassir
[15:08:27] <nafta> I'm sorry but I don't seem to get it
[15:08:48] <Velveeta> what do you have written?
[15:09:04] <nafta> http://jsfiddle.net/g7DHJ/
[15:09:07] <nafta> there it is Velveeta
[15:09:27] <Velveeta> you don't have a dataType parameter in that $.get call
[15:09:38] <Velveeta> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/g7DHJ/1/
[15:10:52] <nafta> oh alright
[15:10:54] <nafta> I'm going to test
[15:10:57] <nafta> thanks again Velveeta
[15:11:48] <Velveeta> no problemo, i'm out for a while :D
[15:11:59] <nafta> ok thanks

[15:40:30] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me with a simple function of jquery? I'm trying to add or remove class to a li element, but it not works. Any help please? The part of my code: http://pastebin.com/nrMtNzri
[15:41:45] <jphase> abailarri: looks fine, do you have errors in your console?
[15:42:31] <abailarri> jphase, no
[15:42:52] <jphase> abailarri: hmm, can you make a jsfiddle with some markup in there so I can see what's going on?
[15:43:22] <abailarri> ok jphase
[15:47:46] <sunbeam> i have a mouseenter
[15:47:55] <sunbeam> after tyhat i add .mouseleave(function() { } )
[15:48:07] <sunbeam> but this mouseleave should be from another object
[15:48:17] <sunbeam> relative to the object I originally mouseentered one
[15:48:18] <sunbeam> on
[15:50:51] <Guest12398> hey guys
[15:51:40] <abailarri> jphase, If I put the code in jsfiddle, it works
[15:51:52] <abailarri> but In my html code no. Why?
[15:51:58] <Guest12398> is there anyway to combine the below?
[15:52:02] <Guest12398> $(document).on('keyup', '.classone', function(){  ...  $(document).on('click', '.classtwo', function(){
[15:52:20] <zakj> abailarri: your script is running before your content is loaded, so the $('li a') will not find the elements. either move the script tag to the end of your body element, or wrap the contents of the script tag in $(function () { /* your code */ });
[15:54:59] <abailarri> ok zakj now it works, Thx
[15:55:12] <zakj> np
[16:19:24] <esmic> jphase you still there
[16:19:33] <esmic> i made a fiddle to illustrate

[16:35:54] <eliudnir> Hi, I wrote myself a small function to just add a bunch of img's to my html using .load() and .append() - now I am tring to cache said img's to a variable, which doens't work - any hints?
[16:35:55] <gregf_> hi, i'm trying to get a select to readonly but this somehow does not work: $('#class_select').attr('readonly', true);
[16:42:08] <B0TTiG> im stumped with a jquery issue
[16:42:24] <B0TTiG> can someone look at my fiddle and tell me why my jquery isnt working?
[16:42:46] <B0TTiG> Fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/LUdWC/
[16:43:59] <aro> how come when you set a radio button using prop(), it doesnt trigger the change event?
[16:44:26] <oste> is pnotify the best notification query plugin?
[16:44:34] <oste> should I be looking into other options?
[16:45:47] <oste> https://github.com/needim/noty/
[16:45:49] <oste> hrm
[16:47:21] <rmah> I've been trying out noty
[16:47:23] <rmah> it's ok
[16:47:29] <rmah> a bit verbose though
[16:48:04] <oste> rmah have you tried pnotify?
[16:48:09] <rmah> nope
[16:48:17] <oste> ah, know of any other options?
[16:48:46] <B0TTiG> Would anyone mind reviewing my jquery?
[16:49:55] <jphase> B0TTiG: hmm, elaborate on "isn't working"
[16:50:22] <B0TTiG> jphase: https://engineering.purdue.edu/Faboratory/testing/index.html see it in action here
[16:50:37] <eliudnir> anyone know how I can select and assign to a variable elements that's been added to the DOM using append() ?
[16:50:53] <jphase> B0TTiG: jQuery isn't defined on this page
[16:51:35] <B0TTiG> jphase: can you elaborate? I use script src in the head
[16:52:11] <jphase> B0TTiG: ctrl + shift + j    or   cmd + shift + j    says "$ is not defined"  so for some reason it doesn't like your $
[16:52:28] <jphase> B0TTiG: try changing $(function(){   to    jQuery(document).ready(function($){    and see if that works
[16:52:51] <jphase> actually nvm
[16:52:57] <jphase> that won't work cause I can't use jQuery in the console
[16:53:30] <B0TTiG> ok, thanks
[16:53:32] <jphase> sec
[16:54:14] <oste> http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/
[16:54:56] <B0TTiG> jphase: were you talking to me?
[16:55:01] <jphase> yes, one sec
[16:55:06] <B0TTiG> k
[16:56:10] <oste> so looks like the big players in the notifications plugin game are
[16:56:13] <oste> noty - https://github.com/needim/noty
[16:56:20] <oste> alertify - http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/
[16:56:27] <oste> pnotify - http://pinesframework.org/pnotify/
[16:56:32] <xid_> you talkin to me? well i'm the only one here. i'm standin here you make the move.
[16:57:17] <eliudnir> Hi, I'm gonna try this again; I have a page that has some img added by a script using jquery .append() - later on I wanna cache these img's to variables and access them, this doesn't seem to work at all - i assume this is because I did append() - any idea, pointers ?
[16:58:44] <jphase> B0TTiG: hmm, something is off on this page. try removing your init.js file for a second so I can do some tests
[16:59:56] <B0TTiG> jphase: done
[16:59:57] <jphase> B0TTiG: works fine in the fiddle and I can't console.log(jQuery) so that's an issue
[17:00:33] <B0TTiG> jphase: yea, its frustrating... seems like it shouldnt be a problem
[17:00:40] <jphase> B0TTiG: you need to use // instead of http:// in your google include there
[17:00:52] <jphase> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:01:03] <jphase> since you're loading over HTTPS that will just match the current protocol being used ;)
[17:01:20] <jphase> then you can put your init.js back in
[17:02:26] <B0TTiG> jphase: yes! thanks for spotting that
[17:02:30] <xid_> eliudnir: you need to make sure your statement is executing after the append() has inserted its code. sometimes the best thing you can do is post a jsfiddle.net
[17:02:32] <B0TTiG> jphase: it works
[17:03:28] <jphase> B0TTiG: cool beans. Also load your Raleway font with // as well ;)
[17:03:29] <zakj> jphase: :D
[17:04:13] <jphase> zakj: !!!!!!!
[17:04:28] <jphase> thanks so much for your gift man!!! you guys are the best!
[17:04:35] <zakj> jphase: ¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°
[17:04:40] <sunbeam> when I rightclick on a page I get a copyright popup
[17:04:42] <zakj> no, you're the best! ;)
[17:04:42] <sunbeam> how can I disable this?
[17:08:33] <eliudnir> i can't fiddle this, it's spread out on a lot of files
[17:09:00] <eliudnir> it's easy to think about tho, images are added and class is added to images, i later try to select all images of said class, but can't, no selection
[17:11:10] <eliudnir> it's obvious it has to do with hte objects having been appended with append() since it works if i try to select something not added with append()
[17:11:41] <jphase> eliudnir: sounds like your selector of those images is firing before they're appended to the DOM
[17:11:43] <eliudnir> the only documentation I can find tells me to to select an object using $('.whatever') as the selector
[17:11:58] <eliudnir> jphase, how do I fix that ?
[17:12:10] <jphase> eliudnir: make sure your event fires after they're appended to the DOM
[17:12:17] <eliudnir> right
[17:12:19] <eliudnir> how ? :)
[17:12:29] <jphase> hmm, so your .append()
[17:12:33] <eliudnir>  just doing the script after isn't working
[17:12:40] <jphase> that needs to happen before the $('.whatever')
[17:12:53] <eliudnir> right, that isn't working
[17:13:57] <jphase> eliudnir: for example, bind a click event to a button or something, then console.log($('.whatever'))  on that click event, then make sure you click the button after the stuff is appended and you'll see your stuff
[17:14:12] <eliudnir> on my page i'm loading two scripts, first in the html comes the one that adds the img's, then comes the one where i try to cache them as variables and log it just to see if i even can at this point, it doesn't work tho
[17:14:56] <jphase> loading two scripts meaning <script src="something.js"></script>   or .getScript?
[17:15:05] <eliudnir> <script>
[17:15:19] <jphase> k, and what event does the .append happen on ?
[17:15:21] <jphase> doc ready?
[17:15:26] <eliudnir> yeah
[17:15:38] <eliudnir> ohhh
[17:15:39] <eliudnir> i see
[17:15:48] <eliudnir> i need to fire the other script after, not on doc ready
[17:15:51] <eliudnir> boo
[17:15:57] <eliudnir> now I gotta figure out how that happends :)
[17:16:02] <jphase> well, you just need to make sure one happens after the other
[17:16:06] <eliudnir> right
[17:16:13] <eliudnir> any documentation on this i should read ?
[17:16:20] <eliudnir> i don't like bugging you people :P
[17:16:33] <jphase> what do you mean "you people" ?????
[17:16:33] <jphase> j/k
[17:16:37] <eliudnir> haha
[17:16:46] <eliudnir> you pro's ?
[17:16:50] * eliudnir whistles
[17:16:57] <jphase> no, just based on the events that fire really, hard to definitively say without seeing the code
[17:17:22] <eliudnir> ok - i am definitely ashamed of my code atm, so not sharing, but i'll try to figure this out, at least i know why it's not working
[17:17:25] <eliudnir> that's half the battle :)
[17:17:30] <eliudnir> thanks a billion jphase
[17:17:31] <eliudnir> :)

[19:03:38] <LoneSoldier728> basically I am having issues with removing views from backbone and was thinking about maybe lookin at it

[19:06:05] <LoneSoldier728> what do u mean
[19:06:16] <esmic> they add together
[19:06:20] <esmic> all
[19:06:32] <esmic> i want only 2 of them to add
[19:07:02] <LoneSoldier728> aren't you basing it off what is selected tho
[19:07:38] <LoneSoldier728> so cant you just include 2
[19:07:41] <LoneSoldier728> as oppose to 3 of em

[20:27:11] <Vorspire> VectorX; cross-domain ajax requests are not allowed
[20:27:40] <Vorspire> if your server supports PHP, consider using cURL to fetch and output the target url data
[20:28:08] <VectorX> i need to do it from the client side
[20:28:22] <grafi> you cant
[20:28:31] <Vorspire> you can, but you reference your ajax request target url to your local php file
[20:29:41] <Vorspire> a typical cURL GET request and data output in PHP can be done in about 10 lines of code or less
[20:30:00] <VectorX> Vorspire i need it to be client side
[20:30:20] <Vorspire> then you can't do it
[20:30:24] <B0TTiG> Ive got a bit of jQuery here that I could use some help with... http://jsfiddle.net/LUdWC/
[20:30:38] <Vorspire> even with the ajax option crossDomain set to true, it will still be blocked
[20:30:51] <Vorspire> if using google chrome, hit f12 and look at the console logs on jsfiddle
[20:31:30] <grafi> B0TTiG what do you need help with?
[20:31:35] <esmic> BOTTIG im really bad at it, but what isyour question
[20:32:16] <B0TTiG> grafi: I want to be able to click the same button, and remove the content
[20:33:32] <VectorX> Vorspire i know the problem, im trying to see how do it
[20:33:38] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/LUdWC/1/ B0TTiG
[20:34:10] <B0TTiG> grafi: excellent, thanks!
[20:35:56] <cauffe> Does anyone here have any expirence in putting jQueryRotate into production? http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/ ?
[20:39:40] <grafi> like how it works, or if it works?
[20:39:58] <Vorspire> BOTTiG; http://jsfiddle.net/LUdWC/2/
[20:40:26] <Vorspire> no need for all the attributes
[20:41:12] <Vorspire> B0TTiG *
[20:41:15] <grafi> Vorspire binding a click handler to each button is not very good though
[20:42:23] <Vorspire> it can be optimized, to not use attributes and only use one subscription
[20:42:30] <Vorspire> best of both worlds
[20:44:02] <grafi> how would you do that?
[20:46:14] <VectorX> Vorspire i got it to work
[20:46:15] <Vorspire> grafi; http://jsfiddle.net/LUdWC/3/
[20:47:17] <grafi> not sure if thats going to be faster than selecting by id
[20:47:23] <grafi> but ok :)
[20:54:09] <esmic> how do i assign an array to an <option>and then post that array to multiple divs
[20:56:48] <systemfault> esmic: Do you mind explaining it more?
[20:56:55] <Jibblit> What kind of array?  And what do you mean by 'post it to multiple divs'?
[20:57:07] <Jibblit> Like print a string representation of the array in the div?
[20:59:36] <esmic> each option represents some numbers like (1,2,7,8,9) and then when you select option it post to <div =attribute1>  <div =attribute2>
[21:00:41] <esmic> select option that is
[21:01:14] <systemfault> Post what?
[21:01:40] <esmic> i try make a fiddle
[21:07:26] <oste> anyone know of a jquery plugin that can give this effect http://codecanyon.net/item/zoomflow-banner-rotator-teaser/full_screen_preview/4257939
[21:07:44] <oste> main image is in the middle with other images set behind it
[21:08:18] <oste> would be even better if 5 images can be shown at once
[21:08:39] <esmic> systemfault:http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/Dc254/ triedtoexplain it here
[21:09:16] <oste> http://codecanyon.net/item/icarousel-wordpress/full_screen_preview/2589154?ref=janecross
[21:29:48] <amh345> var replaceText = $('.select_wrapper a[data-productid="414"]');  replaceText.text().replace(/Add/g,"");   in console returns the proper text within console.. but it doesn't update the html.  am i missing something here?
[21:35:03] <amh345> ok, well replaceText.html(replaceText.html().replace(/Add/g,"")); did the trick
[21:36:55] <nafta> is there a native tooltip that I could use on jquery?
[21:43:30] <oste> looking for an open source version of something like these
[21:43:31] <oste> http://codecanyon.net/item/boutique-carousel/full_screen_preview/113093
[21:43:36] <oste> http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-carousel-evolution/full_screen_preview/490018
[21:43:41] <oste> http://codecanyon.net/item/icarousel/full_screen_preview/2527180
[21:43:57] <oste> ie. the main image is in the middle and there is overlay
[21:46:05] <tw2113> http://imageflow.finnrudolph.de/
[21:48:05] <aro> if i have a select drop down that is dynamically populated, how do i prevent auto complete from messing it up? when autocomplete completes a form, it tends to insert blank values into the select
[22:26:03] <MightyMu> nafta: have you looked at qtip2?
[22:26:20] <nafta> nop
[22:26:22] <nafta> what is it?

[22:38:36] <Aquaguy> Hello
[22:39:13] <Aquaguy> When doing something like sections.find('.title').text() is it possible to retrieve all .title's text in just a single string
[22:39:19] <Aquaguy> like using join in an array or something
[22:44:10] <jphase> Aquaguy: I think you'll have to iterate for that:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/YA7H6/2/
[22:44:54] <PhaseCode> Hey jphase!
[22:46:39] <jphase> hi PhaseCode
[23:03:04] <d3m0n> Hey guys, anyone else notice firefox shows abunch of errors from jQuery now?
[23:03:17] <d3m0n> Doesnt look to effect anything, just firefox showing erros
[23:10:23] <grafi> nope
[23:45:47] <wormmd> Hey all. I have this fiddle, and I don't know quite what I'm doing wrong to get it to play right. I've got my bow all rosined up and everything: http://jsfiddle.net/wormmd/zfDaM/
[23:46:20] <wormmd> Let me know if you can't figure out at a passing glance what I'm trying to do and what's not happening.
[23:46:50] <wormmd> That's the wrong link.
[23:46:59] <jphase> wormmd: what seems to be the problem?
[23:47:06] <wormmd> This is the right one: http://jsfiddle.net/wormmd/zfDaM/2/
[23:48:03] <wormmd> jphase, I'm trying to hide all divs but the one with class "content vis" initially (working), and switch divs based on the h1 element clicked in the bav bar (not working).
[23:48:48] <wormmd> *nav bar
[23:50:05] <jphase> wormmd: I don't think your h1 is going to have a .val() there
[23:51:48] <jphase> wormmd: try something like $(this).text().toLowerCase() instead
[23:52:28] <jphase> granted, I'd suggest using something like a rel="home" on your h1 though rather than base it off the text of the h1 itself. It's a bit of a cleaner method
[23:53:33] <wormmd> The text suggestion worked, but I'm all about clean code.
[23:54:31] <jphase> yeah, use something like... http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/zfDaM/3/
[23:54:53] <jphase> rel tags in there will make them relate and then you can have like "Contact Us" instead or whatever you want
[23:56:54] <wormmd> Is rel an attribute you can set arbitrarily on any tag?
[23:57:03] <jphase> yeah
[23:57:34] <jphase> you could use any attribute really, but rel is short for relative or relational or something of the like so I use it for things like that personally
[23:57:57] <wormmd> Nice. Can you set any arbitrary attribute on any tag and assume that the renderer will jsut skip it if it doesn't know what to do?
[23:58:33] <jphase> yes, you could technically set blah="farts" but some folks don't like to use things like that since the reason you mentioned
[23:58:58] <jphase> if you care about w3c validation then you may want to use something that's already commonly used
[23:59:59] <grafi> data-blah="farts"
