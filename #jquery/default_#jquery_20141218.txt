[00:09:51] <pilgrimish> http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/6229356z/9/ how could i target either of the videos, instead of just one in this function?
[00:21:24] <Cork> pilgrimish: you can't
[00:21:35] <Cork> the videos is loaded in frames from cross origin
[00:21:44] <Cork> so you don't have access to the content of the iframe
[00:27:36] <pilgrimish> Cork: so there‚Äôs no way to listen in on a video‚Äôs play status on a video by video basis on a single page?
[00:27:57] <Cork> pilgrimish: if you have the <video> tag on your page, sure
[00:27:59] <Cork> you you don't
[00:28:13] <Cork> you have an iframe from a third party server and they have the video tag
[00:28:39] <Cork> and cors block your access to the page there
[00:29:03] <Cork> so you have to relay on there api for interaction
[00:31:59] <pilgrimish> would mediaelementjs be a better option in terms of having control over that?
[00:32:17] <Cork> wouldn't know
[00:32:22] <Cork> check what controls they offer you
[01:08:48] <pilgrimish> Cork: this seems to make more sense, wrapping the iframe in a video tag wrapper, though I‚Äôm now just as lost‚Ä¶ :) http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/k5z4w572/17/
[01:09:05] <Cork> lol
[01:09:15] <Cork> pilgrimish: no, you can't embed an iframe in a video tag
[01:09:29] <Cork> pilgrimish: video is how you embed the video file
[01:09:49] <pilgrimish> i mean, it‚Äôs being done dynamically, via mediaelement js, i believe
[01:09:51] <Cork> but if you use a third party service they normally don't let you have direct access to the file
[01:12:39] <HansWurst> hello guys
[01:12:51] <HansWurst> i have a question to multiple select
[01:20:12] <HansWurst> is it possible to get the "new selected options" of a multiple select if there are 2 selected and i select 2 more?
[01:20:32] <HansWurst> is there something like a previous state in the .change() ?
[01:20:37] <Cork> HansWurst: you would have to store what the old ones was
[01:20:47] <Cork> and then compare the difference
[01:21:03] <Cork> and no form elements don't keep a modification history
[01:21:19] <HansWurst> ok thx
[01:30:07] <mooncup> morning guys
[01:30:53] <jacomyal> Hi
[01:31:09] <mooncup> I'm trying to achieve something like this:
[01:31:13] <mooncup> $('.reward-table-ajax').load($(this).attr('href'));
[01:31:23] <mooncup> where the href is attached to the reward-table-ajax element
[01:31:45] <mooncup> but $(this) atm refers to the selector that is calling the load function
[01:31:54] <mooncup> rather than the selector for the load, if you see what I mean
[01:31:55] <Cork> var target = $('.reward-table-ajax'); target.load(target.attr('href'));
[01:32:29] <mooncup> and will that work for multiple selectors at once cork?
[01:32:34] <Cork> no
[01:32:38] <mooncup> ah
[01:32:42] <Cork> you woould have to loop in those cases
[01:32:50] <mooncup> ok that would work I guess
[01:32:51] <mooncup> thanks
[01:32:52] <Cork> also i doubt this is in an <a> element
[01:32:55] <Cork> so you shouldn't use href
[01:33:01] <mooncup> I could use a data tag I guess
[01:33:05] <Cork> you should
[01:33:15] <Cork> data-<what ever>
[01:34:39] <topriddy_> hi guys
[01:34:53] <topriddy_> i am having problems with a simple task as submitting a form from jquery sending a form automatically using jquery
[01:35:03] <topriddy_> ~pastebin
[01:43:53] <MadHeadFreak> Hey, is this the right way to use .on if I want to take a.attr('id')? $('#top-menu').on('click', 'a', $(this).attr('id'), function(){});
[01:44:17] <Cork> what what?
[01:44:34] <MadHeadFreak> I want to pass c as data
[01:44:40] <MadHeadFreak> on has 4 params
[01:44:57] <Cork> most likely no
[01:45:01] <Cork> but too little context
[01:45:06] <MadHeadFreak> events, element, data, handler
[01:45:15] <Cork> ?paste
[01:45:15] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:45:47] <MadHeadFreak> Cork, there is no code. I just want to clarify, this was made on the go.
[01:46:10] <Cork> MadHeadFreak: what is "this" meant to reference in this case?
[01:46:13] <MadHeadFreak> I want to pass data to handler
[01:46:22] <MadHeadFreak> this = a
[01:46:29] <Cork> and what is a...
[01:46:35] <MadHeadFreak> a is a link
[01:46:54] <Cork> so you want to access the link the event handler target?
[01:46:59] <MadHeadFreak> <a id='smth' href='#' >lblalbal</a>
[01:47:03] <Cork> why not just access it in the function?
[01:47:16] <Cork> $('#top-menu').on('click', 'a', function(){ $(this).attr('id') });
[01:47:36] <MadHeadFreak> Cork, but why not exploit .on if it has this prebuild?
[01:47:49] <Cork> MadHeadFreak: cause you don't have the element in the scope where you run it
[01:47:56] <MadHeadFreak> But doesn't document how to do that, I only saw json examples
[01:47:58] <Cork> this there would be to the wrapping function
[01:48:36] <MadHeadFreak> Cork, what does wrapping function mean in this case?
[01:48:46] <Cork> (function() { $('#top-menu').on('click', 'a', $(this).attr('id'), function(){}); /* $(this) === $(window) here */  }).call(window);
[01:48:56] <Cork> MadHeadFreak: the function your code runs in
[01:49:13] <Cork> MadHeadFreak: .on is not a function scope it doesn't create a this variable
[01:49:25] <Cork> it just take parameters
[01:49:32] <Cork> sorry arguments
[01:49:35] <MadHeadFreak> oh
[01:50:03] <MadHeadFreak> So I can generate json from other functions and put it into .on function.
[01:50:08] <Cork> the data column is a way to attach static data to the event handler
[01:50:17] <MadHeadFreak> And handle them in handler
[01:50:17] <Cork> kinda
[01:50:28] <Cork> though it is per handler, not per element
[01:50:36] <Cork> so it isn't normally very useful
[01:50:40] <MadHeadFreak> Cork, thanx for clarification, I was expecting some thing out of the box :-D
[01:50:58] <Cork> MadHeadFreak: $('').data() is prob more what you need
[01:51:19] <MadHeadFreak> Cork, okay I'll investigate that one :-)
[01:51:22] <Cork> then you can attach data with an element
[01:55:59] <wa5ted> grafi:  where are you
[01:56:02] <wa5ted> i know you are there
[02:05:14] <Omar-> is for loops async?
[02:05:45] <Cork> no
[02:06:27] <Omar-> how can make them async
[02:06:37] <Cork> you can't
[02:07:01] <Cork> you can recurs call a function to create something like it though
[02:07:46] <Cork> function next(i) { setTimeout(function() { next(++i); }); } next(0);
[02:08:00] <Cork> that would create an async loop
[02:08:05] <Omar-> Cork thank you. shall I use $.each instead?
[02:08:12] <Cork> it isn't async
[02:08:12] <Omar-> inside a widget?
[02:08:25] <Cork> Omar-: why do you need an async loop?
[02:08:35] <Cork> or rather do you really need it?
[02:08:55] <Omar-> I want to create html elements and then loop through other elements to add prevously created ones
[02:09:17] <Cork> and this needs to be async cause?
[02:09:26] <arschmitz> Omar-: JS is single threaded so async in general really does not apply to actual operations and only to special things like events and ajax
[02:09:27] <keksike> how can I simply get json from my node.js mongodb server?
[02:09:33] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/wmynawyq/3/ line 53 first for loop to create elements
[02:09:53] <Omar-> line 60 appends created elements into another for loop
[02:10:09] <Omar-> what happens now is that, it appends only to last element
[02:11:22] <Cork> Omar-: that sounds like you only use the first element in the list for some reason
[02:11:27] <Cork> async won't help you there
[02:12:04] <HansWurst> Cork: is it possible to make the selection in a multiple select toggle with a click on the options?
[02:12:29] <Cork> HansWurst: you would have to do that manually
[02:13:06] <Omar-> Cork it's weird, I dont why. console logs all data but nothing in being added to elements except for last one
[02:13:13] <arschmitz> Omar-: in fact async would make what your trying to do much much harder as you would need a promise to know when your first loop was done before starting the second
[02:13:38] <arschmitz> you very much want that to be sync no async
[02:13:52] <HansWurst> Cork: do u know if there is a snippet for something like that somewhere?
[02:14:00] <Cork> Omar-: so follow the code from there you have it to where it is appended and figure out where the other elements gets lost
[02:14:16] <Cork> HansWurst: google it, you should be able to find it fairly quick
[02:14:19] <Omar-> arschmitz so you recommend I create child elements in another function and then append them once done?
[02:14:29] <arschmitz> no
[02:14:48] <arschmitz> im im not suggesting anything besides that you very much do not want async
[02:14:59] <Cork> Omar-: you want to avoid appending the elements to the page as long as possible
[02:15:11] <Cork> cause when you do you get reflow, and that makes things slow
[02:15:32] <Omar-> Cork so you suggest using pure JS to create child elements?
[02:15:47] <Cork> Omar-: what you do there looks like it should work just fine
[02:15:48] <Omar-> arschmitz thanks for the heads up
[02:15:56] <Cork> follow the code and see where the elements are lost
[02:15:59] <Omar-> arschmitz what would you recommend?
[02:16:25] <arschmitz> Omar-: like cork said something is broken in your logic
[02:16:26] <Omar-> Cork I will double check it, there must be something missing
[02:16:37] <arschmitz> trace it step by step to find out what your doing wrong
[02:16:49] <Cork> Omar-: something like appending them one at a time with .html() for example
[02:16:54] <Cork> instead of adding them all in one go
[02:17:22] <Omar-> arschmitz btw, I used _getChildrenByTagName function from listview widget. I'll give jQM attribution of course ;)
[02:18:00] <Omar-> Cork sure I will try other methods
[02:18:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: its all open source and MIT
[02:18:39] <Omar-> arschmitz MIT means attribution required I assume?
[02:20:19] <Omar-> Cork if I replace .append(html) with .append(html markup string) it works
[02:20:32] <Omar-> so something wrong in html var
[02:20:36] <Omar-> in previous for loop
[02:20:37] <Cork> wait a min...
[02:20:38] <arschmitz> Omar-: fixed
[02:20:39] <arschmitz> http://jsfiddle.net/wmynawyq/4/
[02:21:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: stuff was a refrence to a specific element
[02:21:10] <arschmitz> so on each iteration of the second loop your moving it
[02:21:18] <arschmitz> you need to clone it each time
[02:21:37] <Omar-> arschmitz oh, so I had to clone it!
[02:21:42] <Cork> ah
[02:21:58] <Omar-> wonderful
[02:22:18] <Omar-> what a noob I am
[02:22:29] <arschmitz> omar but you dont need that loop at all
[02:22:39] <Cork> Omar-: it's a very common mistake, so don't worry too much about it
[02:22:42] <Omar-> second loop arschmitz?
[02:23:06] <Omar-> Cork If you just know the truth, you'd laugh for ages
[02:23:22] <Omar-> just two years ago, I didn't know that one element can accept more than one class
[02:24:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/wmynawyq/6/
[02:24:25] <arschmitz> you dont need the second for loop at all
[02:25:33] <Omar-> arschmitz much better, thanks a lot
[02:35:18] <Omar-> is this a good way to attach events? html = html.add("<span class=" + btnClass + "><p class='btn'>" + text + "</p></span>").on(event, todo);
[02:35:30] <Omar-> to dynamically created elements?
[02:38:00] <Omar-> it doesn't work anyway
[02:38:02] <Cork> Omar-: if the handler is meant to do about the same thing
[02:38:09] <Cork> use a delegated event listener for all of them instead
[02:38:13] <Cork> much cheaper
[02:38:55] <Omar-> Cork true, but in case a user wants to attach a different function for each button upon initializing the widget
[02:39:13] <Cork> Omar-: doesn't really prevent that
[02:39:20] <Omar-> of course, one delegated event is much better
[02:39:31] <Cork> you could just have a function that checks for ex a class or data-<something> on the element
[02:39:40] <Cork> and have an array/object where the final function is
[02:39:49] <Omar-> hmmmm
[02:39:59] <Cork> something like callbacks[$(this).data('type')]()
[02:40:33] <Omar-> well, this is not within my skills scope haha
[02:40:38] <Omar-> too much for me to understand
[02:41:02] <Omar-> anyway, let the user attach events outside the widget
[02:41:08] <Cork> ok, looking at the code
[02:41:16] <Omar-> i dont want to complicate things
[02:41:37] <Omar-> thanks Cork, I appreciate it
[02:41:37] <Cork> you would use something like defaults.buttons[$(this).index()].callback.todo()
[02:42:09] <Cork> though you might want to simplify the structure a bit
[02:42:39] <Omar-> Cork looks simpler for sure
[02:42:51] <Omar-> but where to add the event? e.g. click
[02:43:18] <Cork> well it is buttons, all events would be click right?
[02:43:35] <Omar-> yea, click, tap, vclick
[02:43:40] <Cork> ah
[02:43:49] <Omar-> it's for jQM
[02:43:51] <Cork> well i would bind all three at the parent
[02:44:03] <Cork> and just check in a list if the button has one
[02:44:16] <Omar-> I have a click handler already. _handleClick
[02:44:33] <Omar-> this prevents anchor to work in listitem is swiped
[02:44:41] <Cork> i'm just skimming the code, i don't have the time to dig deep into it
[02:44:47] <Omar-> this leads to another question.
[02:44:58] <Omar-> it's ok Cork you've done more than enough
[02:45:45] <Omar-> I'll try to sort out the callback thing, or maybe just drop it. it looks complicated
[02:47:57] <Omar-> the other question, swipe triggers click, so I handle that click with another handle _handleClick which checks offset().left of element
[02:48:09] <Omar-> if it's < 0 return false
[02:48:30] <Omar-> if it's >= 0 let the click pass
[02:48:51] <Omar-> the issue is, at the end of swiping right, the offset is 0
[02:49:19] <Omar-> how can I .off click and .on click again (delay it for a bit)
[02:49:56] <Cork> do swipe have a start and end?
[02:50:24] <Cork> i usually just use the native events
[02:52:12] <Omar-> Cork no, unfortunately it doesn't. it's a custom event by jQM
[02:53:04] <Omar-> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js#L206-L218
[02:54:52] <Cork> Omar-: try checking $.event.special.swipe.eventInProgress in the click handler
[02:55:27] <Cork> not sure of the firing orders but it might work
[02:59:52] <Omar-> Cork sounds like a good idea
[02:59:56] <Omar-> I'll work on it
[03:02:51] <Omar-> Cork same behavior.
[03:03:14] <Omar-> can I use ._delay() in _.on?
[03:03:24] <Cork> not sure
[03:04:57] <Omar-> I'll play around for a bit
[03:06:33] <Omar-> thanks Cork :)
[03:06:38] <Cork> np
[03:06:41] <Omar-> and arschmitz :)
[03:59:11] <Xatenev> Heya
[03:59:12] <Xatenev> a fast questerinho
[03:59:24] <Xatenev> At the moment im using this code: $('.header-tabs .head').hover(
[03:59:24] <Xatenev>    function () {
[03:59:34] <Xatenev> to do something cool on hover over a headline
[04:00:07] <Xatenev> problem: when i just stay over the headline for 0.2 seconds
[04:00:18] <Xatenev> and go away, its not performing all of the cool things i want it to do
[04:00:25] <Xatenev> (which is completly legit cause i dont hover it anymore)
[04:00:42] <Xatenev> how can I tell it to do all my cool things when I hover the element once
[04:01:11] <Cork> ?paste @ Xatenev
[04:01:11] <b-ot> Xatenev: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:01:17] <Xatenev> Ay
[04:01:28] <Xatenev> My cool things explanation wasnt enough? :'D
[04:01:29] <joroc> hey, does chrome have issues with saving user login details in ajax requests?
[04:02:05] <Cork> joroc: if you by user credentials mean basic auth
[04:02:29] <Cork> then ya, browsers mangles that quite badly in all kind of places for ajax calls
[04:02:42] <joroc> in firefox it works but chrome doesn't behave :|
[04:02:52] <Cork> basically basic auth support sucks in all browsers except possibly ie
[04:02:55] <Xatenev> http://pastebin.com/qSDXvsP9
[04:03:08] <Xatenev> Im just using pastebin cause theres no need of an exact testcase I think
[04:03:18] <Cork> Xatenev: where in that line did you see http://pastebin.com ?
[04:03:34] <joroc> is there a simple solution for this?
[04:03:36] <Xatenev> No need of an exact testcase there^^
[04:03:46] <Uhkis> 3 options, go for worst one not in those 3 options :-D
[04:03:59] <Xatenev> I just wanna know if there is an equivalent to hover
[04:04:00] <Cork> joroc: for me, i just dropped the idea of using basic auth from browsers
[04:04:12] <Xatenev> which just performs the action completly, when hovered ONCE
[04:04:22] <Cork> and just used a session cookie for browsers in the rest api
[04:05:07] <Xatenev> Nvm I solve this differently :P
[04:05:12] <joroc> i see , thanks
[04:25:50] <Omar-> Cork I'm trying to compare both events timeStamp, click and swipe
[04:26:14] <Omar-> so I created a _swipeTime function which returns timeStamp of the swipe
[04:26:29] <Omar-> I'm getting undefined which is weird
[04:26:45] <Cork> you prob can't return between the events
[04:26:45] <Omar->             this._swipeTime(event.timeStamp);
[04:26:53] <Cork> as it most likely are separate events
[04:27:01] <Omar-> this is inside _handleSwipe
[04:27:19] <Omar->         _swipeTime: function (time) {
[04:27:19] <Omar->             return time;
[04:27:19] <Omar->         },
[04:27:30] <Omar-> this is the anonymous function
[04:27:31] <Cork> but simplest should be to just do something like console.log('<event-type>', Date.now())
[04:28:28] <Omar-> i'll try this
[04:36:19] <Omar-> Cork best way is to handle all events in one function e.g. _handleEvents
[04:45:28] <Omar-> nothing is working
[04:50:04] <FilipNortic> are there any serious downside with nesting ajaxcalls in many levels?
[04:50:16] <Cork> readability
[04:50:32] <Cork> that is why deferred was added
[04:53:15] <FilipNortic> is defered when and then?
[04:53:45] <FilipNortic> and some others?
[04:55:30] <Cork> FilipNortic: deferred is what makes $.when().then possible
[04:55:38] <Cork> but no it is a different thing
[04:56:04] <Cork> deferred is .done/.fail/.always
[04:56:18] <Cork> and the backend needed to make it work
[04:58:33] <FilipNortic> ok, seems I need to do some reading threre.
[04:59:01] <Cork> FilipNortic: might be of interest to read up in Promise
[04:59:32] <Cork> its an es6 feature added based on - among other - deferred
[04:59:38] <Cork> ?g mdn promise
[05:00:03] <Cork> yay i killed the bot...
[05:00:16] <FilipNortic> The name "promise" always put me of. I can be stupid like that sometimes
[05:00:17] <Cork> FilipNortic: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[05:00:34] <Cork> FilipNortic: well you make a promise of future data
[05:00:45] <Cork> so it makes sense
[05:20:53] <damasceno> Hello. I'm trying to load a GIF image as a loader when Ajax is called but it isn't working. This is the code: http://pastebin.com/wNUk7jWL Is there something wrong? I can't see what's wrong, it's a simple example... Thanks.
[05:33:24] <Cork> damasceno: are you sure you want to replace everything in the page?
[05:33:44] <Cork> also you have .gif.gif
[05:37:36] <Omar-> Cork got it working finally.
[05:37:47] <Omar-> saved timeStamp of swipe in a global var
[05:38:12] <Omar-> and then compared it with click timeStamp
[05:39:07] <Omar-> Cork I appreciate your help and patience.
[05:39:13] <Omar-> talk to you later
[05:39:13] <Cork> yw
[05:40:05] <damasceno> Cork: no I do not want to replace everything, I already fixed the .gif.gif but it doesn't work. :/
[05:40:31] <Cork> damasceno: then you don't want to run .html() on $(this)=
[05:40:41] <damasceno> Cork: I need to call the loader when the Ajax is called, basically that's what I need.
[05:40:57] <Cork> damasceno: and it does that
[05:41:24] <damasceno> Cork: got it. Do have an example?
[05:41:37] <Cork> ?g jquery ajaxStart
[05:41:47] <Cork> right... the bot is dead...
[05:42:01] <Cork> damasceno: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxstart/
[05:43:50] <damasceno> Cork: thanks.
[05:45:28] <Cork> damasceno: and a full chain http://jsfiddle.net/2xkqhorw/
[05:46:06] <damasceno> Cork: thanks.
[05:46:30] <damasceno> Great nickname by the way. Is one of the most beautiful places in Ireland. :)
[05:46:38] <Cork> lol

[07:24:11] <keksike> my node.js server looks like this https://github.com/Keksike/luuppiquotes/blob/master/app.js, so sending a get to /quotes/:id returns a quote-json. How can I use jquery to get the json and display it in the html?
[07:29:13] <Uhkis> ?api get
[07:29:13] <b-ot> Uhkis: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:29:37] <Uhkis> ?api .get
[07:29:38] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[07:30:05] <Uhkis> keksike: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[07:30:47] <keksike> Uhkis: could you give me an example of using this in my program?
[07:40:29] <Uhkis> check  the examples from the api page
[07:42:26] <farid> Hi, I have a set of checkboxes with the same name. using jquery i want ot get the value of all the selected checkboxes and pass it to an ajax.which is doing a point to a php file.... is it possible
[07:42:51] <farid> doing a POST to a php file
[07:44:17] <NoiseEee> as long as the name ends in [] sure
[07:46:16] <farid> which name .. name of the form field or the name of the variable posted via ajax
[07:47:14] <keksike> Uhkis: allright, ill try to do it, thanks for your help
[07:51:07] <NoiseEee> farid: name of the form field. its basic form handling
[07:52:29] <farid> ok thanks I will give that a go
[08:02:51] <stampz> hi
[08:03:30] <stampz> why in jquery mobile 1.4.5 listview items take more height than in 1.1.1 version ?
[08:27:05] <_DB> any reason this doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/en9uezbb/
[08:27:10] <_DB> im trying to create a table via append
[08:27:17] <_DB> im using a php MVC so thats actually written in php in the javascript
[08:27:27] <_DB> but thats what the script looks like on the source
[08:31:03] <Uhkis> works fine here
[09:19:54] <decx> "fine"
[09:26:57] <pacmanfan> is the click event sufficient to detect radio button input?
[09:27:09] <robertmaxrees> use change
[09:27:12] <pacmanfan> i tried to use oninput, but it didn't detect it.
[09:30:48] <pacmanfan> robertmaxrees, thanks
[09:31:06] <Es0teric> question ‚Äî whats another way to do this: this.dom.info.attr('data-meta-stylist') != undefined ?
[09:37:13] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: what part of it? whats the issue?
[09:37:26] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: i am trying to check for undefined values
[09:37:52] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: but are you also asking/trying to wonder if "dom", "info" might also be undefined?
[09:38:09] <NoiseEee> or just about that thing not having an attribute called 'data-meta-stylist'
[09:38:47] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: its defined.. i am just checking the output of it
[09:38:50] <Es0teric> to see if its undefined
[09:39:50] <NoiseEee> sorry im not following, the 'output'?
[09:40:01] <NoiseEee> are you asking if that has an attr called "data-meta-stylist" ?
[09:40:39] <BillCriswell> jQuery Draggable takes a function for the revert property and I learned that you can pass an argument that will be the droppable if it's dropped on a valid droppable. It's not documented but it has worked for a long time. Is there any reason this isn't documented? Should I not use it?
[09:41:45] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: i am asking if the data attr has .text() in it
[09:41:48] <Es0teric> or if its undefined
[09:42:07] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: those are two different things
[09:42:39] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: my problem is that its returning ‚Äúundefined‚Äù
[09:42:41] <NoiseEee> if the attribute is there, then the value is either '' more a string like 'foo'
[09:42:47] <Es0teric> and i am checking for undefined but it still outputs the data
[09:43:12] <NoiseEee> 'undefined' would only be returned if the element did not have the data-meta-stylist attribute
[09:44:38] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: right
[09:44:46] <Es0teric> so then why is it that i am checking for it
[09:44:54] <NoiseEee> thats what i've been trying to ask you
[09:44:55] <Es0teric> by doing != and its still outputting ‚Äúundefined"
[09:44:55] <Es0teric> "
[09:45:45] <NoiseEee> if(typeof(someElement.attr('data-football'))==='undefined') { //the attribute is not present
[09:46:01] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: A demo would make this a lot clearer.
[09:46:21] <Es0teric> i am only looking for logic righ tnow
[09:46:23] <Es0teric> *right
[09:46:33] <Es0teric> i am not trying to spend time making a demo for something that doesnt really need one
[09:46:54] <Es0teric> this is not some elaborate plugin or something‚Ä¶ i am simply doing if statements
[09:47:59] <Es0teric> BillCriswell, NoiseEee http://pastebin.com/vYtc7kre
[09:48:01] <Es0teric> simple stuff
[09:51:22] <Hazim> hi people, can a jquery slider initiate with array values?
[09:53:37] <NoiseEee> what's not working about that Es0teric?
[09:53:59] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: for instance, bylineType.name is still outputting eventhough its ‚Äúundefined"
[09:56:25] <robertmaxrees> btw it's .data('meta-other')
[09:56:28] <robertmaxrees> don't use .attr()
[09:56:51] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, .data() doesnt output the data sometimes
[09:56:57] <Es0teric> .attr() always grabs the field
[09:57:18] <Es0teric> but thats not my problem and i am not about to do a sitewide change for that
[09:57:22] <Es0teric> its staying as is
[09:57:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:57:56] <robertmaxrees> .data() always outputs data.  if you have cases it doesn't, ur doin it rong
[09:58:05] <robertmaxrees> just poining it out.
[09:58:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: again that is not my problem
[09:58:22] <Es0teric> i am only doing what i need to do
[09:58:33] <Es0teric> i have a more pressing issue right now with this ‚Äúundefined‚Äù thing
[09:58:57] <NoiseEee> your OR is whats messing you up
[09:59:13] <Es0teric> NoiseEee: how is the OR messing it up?
[09:59:39] <Es0teric> i do that type of check in PHP all the time.. so why would it be messing it up in js
[09:59:39] <Es0teric> ?
[10:00:15] <NoiseEee> &&
[10:00:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't even need those checks btw.
[10:00:49] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[10:00:56] <robertmaxrees> if (!bylineType.other)
[10:01:04] <robertmaxrees> empty string and undefined are both falsy values
[10:01:26] <robertmaxrees> actually it'd be if (bylineType.other)
[10:01:31] <robertmaxrees> without the ~
[10:01:39] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/1m45xLdn && http://jsfiddle.net/1m45xLdn/1/
[10:01:43] <robertmaxrees> err, !, because it looks like you want to make sure there's a value.
[10:02:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: !bylineType.other is still outputting the return string
[10:02:27] <robertmaxrees> see what i just said - without the !
[10:03:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1m45xLdn/3/
[10:03:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: !bylineType.other still outputs the string
[10:03:29] <NoiseEee> beauty robertmaxrees
[10:03:30] <robertmaxrees> again.
[10:03:40] <NoiseEee> look at the code Es0teric, good luck
[10:03:45] <robertmaxrees> if (bylineType.other) - i misspoke about the ~
[10:03:50] <robertmaxrees> err, exclamation
[10:04:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: oh
[10:04:11] <Es0teric> got it got it
[10:04:16] <Es0teric> yea yeah now i understand i got mixed up lol
[10:04:21] <Es0teric> and NoiseEee i saw those
[10:04:28] <Es0teric> they work there but not with what i am doing
[10:04:34] <NoiseEee> lol ok
[10:04:40] <Es0teric> so robertmaxrees‚Äôs solution actually worked but it makes more sense to me
[10:04:47] <NoiseEee> good
[10:04:59] <robertmaxrees> be lazy.
[10:05:24] <Es0teric> yeah i see that now, if it had a value it would be true ‚Äî if it didnt have a value it would be false.. since my objective is checking for the value i can just check if theres anything existing at all
[10:06:08] <robertmaxrees> this also avoids those pesky comparisons with coercion
[10:06:48] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: theres alot of those != ‚Äò ‚Äô and undefined checks on the js
[10:07:07] <robertmaxrees> aye - i'd avoid the coercive checks.
[10:07:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah i see the point in that now.. i mean php side its useful but in js i see it gets tricky
[10:07:58] <robertmaxrees> type coercion is rarely useful.
[10:08:38] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: yeah but in php i usually do something like `!empty( $string ) || $string != ‚Äò‚Äô ` just to be on the safe side
[10:08:55] <snover> the safe side of what?
[10:09:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't know anything about PHP, but iirc is allows for strict comparisons, which are always better to use.
[10:10:06] <robertmaxrees> it's partially why i kind of wish JS had a better type enforcement mechanism.
[10:11:08] <robertmaxrees> and why facebook's Flow is a Good Thing‚Ñ¢
[10:14:26] <NoiseEee> php is also pretty lacking in type comparisons fwiw
[10:14:30] <NoiseEee> "2" == 2
[10:14:46] <robertmaxrees> does it have a string type comparison mechanism at least?
[10:15:11] <NoiseEee> yeah
[10:15:19] <robertmaxrees> err, strict type
[10:15:46] <NoiseEee> well yeah "2" !== 2
[10:15:51] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:15:56] <robertmaxrees> so like JS.
[10:16:00] <NoiseEee> yep
[10:16:04] <NoiseEee> handicaps for all!
[10:16:12] <robertmaxrees> :D
[10:17:15] <wodim> what's the syntax to check for the existence of a certain attr? $("#blah:[attr]") does not work
[10:17:39] <robertmaxrees> could use .filter9)
[10:17:42] <robertmaxrees> *.filter()
[10:17:50] <wodim> me you say?
[10:17:54] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:17:57] <wodim> ok thanks
[10:19:19] <NoiseEee> wodim: its a weird example you pasted
[10:19:52] <NoiseEee> wodim: either that ID exists or it doesn't; you just want to know if that element has a particular attribute?
[10:19:58] <wodim> NoiseEee: no in fact i just realised the syntax is $("#blah[attr]")
[10:20:10] <robertmaxrees> D:
[10:20:13] <wodim> NoiseEee: you are right, # is wrong here, . would be more appropriate
[10:20:30] <wodim> NoiseEee: for example, a[href] (despite that all a should have a href, but whatever)
[10:20:40] <NoiseEee> ahh sure :)
[10:20:49] <robertmaxrees> I would avoid selecting on those attributes, but I'm weird.
[10:21:18] <wodim> no
[10:21:25] <wodim> in fact i'm selecting on my own data- attributes
[10:21:30] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> don't do that at all then.
[10:22:32] <NoiseEee> you're just looking for particular elements with your own data- attributes?  ie: all divs with a data-productid attribute for example?
[10:37:04] <_DB> sup guys I was wondering how can I make it so when I select a checkbox I can make something happen?
[10:37:22] <_DB> for example I have 5 checkboxes when I check or uncheck I want something to happen
[10:37:30] <robertmaxrees> bind to their change event.
[10:39:47] <_DB> ok
[10:42:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ep56bjyb/
[10:42:29] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[10:44:15] <_DB> robertmaxrees what if this is my checkboxes id  <input type="checkbox" name="ubchk[]" id="ubchk[13]" class="chk-row" value="13">
[10:44:48] <robertmaxrees> what about it
[10:45:23] <_DB> ah I see you used a div and checked the onchange of its inputs?
[10:45:30] <robertmaxrees> event delegation.
[10:45:49] <Primero> hi, in the sample of http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form, the model its open with a button, i want open it with <a href=JavaScript:dialog.dialog("open")>Modal</a>, but I got a "dialog is not defined", how can I call the dialog on this way?
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> don't bind like that.
[10:46:15] <robertmaxrees> use javascript event binding instead.
[10:46:53] <robertmaxrees> also, dialog must be defined as your dialog box.
[10:47:41] <_DB> robertmaxrees thanks for the help bud
[10:47:49] <robertmaxrees> yep
[10:49:25] <cjohnson> 1: Do JSONP and CORS play well together? 2: If I make an $.ajax request with JSONP, do I still get a jq deferred back to call .always on?
[10:49:32] <_DB> lets say I have a div
[10:49:37] <_DB> taht  just displays a number
[10:49:41] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson JSONP doesn't use AJAX
[10:49:44] <_DB> how can I grab the number thats in it?
[10:49:46] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: right
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> _DB use .text()
[10:49:54] <cjohnson> but does jquery still return a promise?
[10:50:06] <robertmaxrees> i believe so, yes.
[10:50:24] <cjohnson> cool beans. I've spent the last 8 hours pulling my hair out trying to get chrome to accept a self-signed CA/cert
[10:50:29] <robertmaxrees> hah
[10:50:29] <cjohnson> only to remember JSONP
[10:50:46] <robertmaxrees> that only works if the other server supports it.
[10:51:28] <cjohnson> yeah I own it. it's a little web server I deploy to client machines. when they load a page in my admin, it makes a request to http://localhost:3000 and if the server is running, I make links to take them there
[10:51:38] <robertmaxrees> ah
[10:51:48] <cjohnson> kind of hacky but it works nicely once I get https/http to play nice
[10:52:04] <robertmaxrees> are you mixing the two?
[10:52:09] <robertmaxrees> because that's going to be a pain.
[10:52:13] <cjohnson> oh wait yeah. I'm dumb. this isn't a solution at all :(
[10:52:21] <_DB> how can I make a global variable?
[10:52:31] <robertmaxrees> _DB avoid them.
[10:52:36] <_DB> alright
[10:52:56] <robertmaxrees> _DB work in your current scope.
[10:53:01] <cjohnson> admin page is https, client server is http. I can get the client to do https but it's self-signed and so the ajax request fails if they haven't approved the exception this page load
[10:53:11] <cjohnson> this browser session*
[10:53:22] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:53:26] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have problems with that.
[10:53:35] <cjohnson> yeah as I've found. aaaaany hacky suggestions?
[10:53:50] <robertmaxrees> not without making users reconfigure their web browsers.
[10:53:55] <cjohnson> fuck
[10:54:01] <cjohnson> I hate technology
[10:54:04] <robertmaxrees> have them both be https
[10:54:07] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[10:54:13] <cjohnson> they are
[10:54:22] <robertmaxrees> " admin page is https, client server is http."
[10:54:27] <robertmaxrees> is the admin local?
[10:54:38] <deepy> That sounds like a weird setup
[10:54:39] <cjohnson> the rest of that is "I can make the client https, but it's a self-signed cert"
[10:54:51] <aarobc> the only reason you you'd put code inside $(function(){...}); is to wait till the document loads right?
[10:54:51] <cjohnson> so ajax request fail until they do the whole "this cert is bad! do you accept it?"
[10:55:01] <cjohnson> yes aarobc
[10:55:05] <robertmaxrees> aarobc and to create a new scope if you want.
[10:55:11] <_DB> alright im having a problem
[10:55:15] <robertmaxrees> _DB fiddle it.
[10:55:25] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson you need to make them both http or https.
[10:56:12] <aarobc> because this guy is doing it EVERYWHERE just for $(document).on() stuff, and because it's bound to the document, I really see no reason for him to be putting it inside the $(function(){..});
[10:56:30] <robertmaxrees> because he wasn't sure where else to put it.
[10:56:40] <_DB> robertmaxrees    http://jsfiddle.net/ep56bjyb/1/
[10:56:40] <robertmaxrees> might have wanted IIFEs instead.
[10:56:43] <aarobc> lol
[10:56:53] <_DB> I want the number on there to go down by 1 everytime you check a new box
[10:57:04] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: right. they're both https. but again, the ajax request fails until they have added my self-signed cert to their exception list. and chrome doesn't seem to store that exception permanently, so this would have to happen every browser session
[10:57:07] <robertmaxrees> _DB ah, you want to hold state.
[10:57:30] <robertmaxrees> _DB .text() returns... text.
[10:57:32] <robertmaxrees> not a number.
[10:58:11] <robertmaxrees> also, you don't want that code in the each.
[10:58:52] <robertmaxrees> _DB so it starts at 12 and goes down by one every time you check a box?
[10:58:59] <robertmaxrees> what if I un-check and then re-check?
[10:59:23] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[11:02:40] <BillCriswell> It's time for Yaht Rock.
[11:02:45] <BillCriswell> Cause it feels like Friday.
[11:02:58] <robertmaxrees> isn't it always time for yacht rock?
[11:04:21] <BillCriswell> You have a really good point.
[11:04:52] <robertmaxrees> for once.
[11:06:30] <BillCriswell> The absolute first time.
[11:07:06] <robertmaxrees> jeeeze
[11:09:29] <BillCriswell> 8)
[11:09:39] <BillCriswell> Ew, looks like the drupal guy a bit.
[11:09:48] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaa
[11:09:50] <robertmaxrees> ew drupal
[11:10:32] <Primero> somebody speak spanish and works freelance, I need support for a project
[11:10:57] <Primero> javascript and jquery support
[11:11:22] <robertmaxrees> might have more luck in #freelance/
[11:11:27] <BillCriswell> thinkxl: ^^
[11:11:32] <robertmaxrees> * #freelance
[11:11:46] <thinkxl> Primero: Que onda
[11:12:09] <thinkxl> Primero: Yo hablo espanol, que necesitas?
[11:12:15] <BillCriswell> I believe that means something in spanish.
[11:12:29] <Primero> private, please
[11:12:45] <thinkxl> Send it
[11:13:21] <cjohnson> Yeah I'm just going to give up my goal of checking if the server is running. I'll just always show the link to localhost and if it's down, it's down
[11:14:01] <cjohnson> seems chrome has killed off using self-signed certs
[11:14:10] <cjohnson> in any practical fashion anyway
[11:15:13] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[11:28:00] <notchris> I have a link inside of a div
[11:28:15] <BillCriswell> notchris: What are you thinking?!
[11:28:28] <notchris> How can I make clicking on the div go to the href of that link
[11:28:29] <robertmaxrees> links in divs?  live is getty crazy
[11:28:34] <notchris> @BillCriswell Haha :P
[11:28:36] <robertmaxrees> D:
[11:28:45] <notchris> hey @robertmaxrees :)
[11:28:56] <BillCriswell> notchris: Can you wrap the div in an <a> tag instead?
[11:28:57] <robertmaxrees> i hate to say it, but change the div to a link
[11:29:00] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[11:29:26] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I agree. It feels like parking the garage in a car but it's definitely fine to do.
[11:29:38] <notchris> Cant I just search for a link in a div and pull the href
[11:29:40] <robertmaxrees> oh absolutely.  i've done it a few times.
[11:29:45] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's a bad idea.
[11:29:49] <Jacta> What can I check for if I dont get any answer back on a xhr request send af json to same domain - but if I test with a tool I get response - anything normal to check for?
[11:29:49] <robertmaxrees> just use a link instead.
[11:30:07] <Jacta> just get "failed to load response data" in chrome - eventhough there should be some json
[11:30:19] <BillCriswell> notchris: a { display: block; } is a div with linking power.
[11:30:36] <_DB> robertmaxrees sorry was on break
[11:30:44] <_DB> yeah if they uncheck make the number go up
[11:30:53] <_DB> if they check make it go down one
[11:30:56] <BillCriswell> notchris: If you insist on the other way though you can do $('.some-div').on('click', function () { window.location.replace($(this).find('a').prop('href')); });
[11:31:11] <notchris> Thanks @BillCriswell
[11:31:15] <notchris> I‚Äôm going to go with the first way
[11:31:17] <_DB> basically I have to assign objects to a users order
[11:31:21] <BillCriswell> notchris: :(
[11:31:23] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[11:31:24] <notchris> So that @robertmaxrees wont be dissapointed in me
[11:31:40] <_DB> so if he ordered 5 I want to check 5..so when that value is 0 they can no longer check anymore
[11:32:13] <_DB> (well atleast it wont save data in the database if its over the amount ordered)
[11:34:07] <Jacta> Can anyone give me a clue :/

[11:35:22] <_DB> on that link
[11:36:23] <Jacta> http://kortlink.dk/fk55
[11:37:20] <BillCriswell> I wish there was a best practice guide for using jQuery UI widgets.
[11:37:50] <BillCriswell> Wonder if I'd be qualified to write something like that up.
[11:38:11] <BillCriswell> I guess that's the good thing about the internet, you can write about whatever you want with a bit of authority.
[11:40:36] <_DB> lol
[11:42:13] <_DB> robertmaxrees any idea how I can do that?
[11:42:19] <robertmaxrees> sorry was away for a sec.
[11:42:46] <robertmaxrees> _DB fiddle again?
[11:42:59] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/ep56bjyb/1/
[11:43:18] <_DB> im trying to make that number go down and up depending if I select or deselect a checkbox
[11:44:23] <robertmaxrees> easy - add a data-defaulvalue="12" to that div and then subtract the number of clicked checkboxes from it.
[11:44:48] <_DB> ahh
[11:44:50] <_DB> trye
[11:44:53] <_DB> true**
[11:45:09] <Getty> robertmaxrees: forgetty that usage of my nick ;)
[11:45:22] <_DB> do you know how I can change the value of a dataelement?
[11:45:31] <robertmaxrees> _DB you wouldn't change it ever
[11:45:43] <_DB> well I set the value of the div
[11:45:48] <_DB> through jquery
[11:45:50] <robertmaxrees> right, you don't change the data/.
[11:46:02] <_DB> so I would have to set the default  value of the default value element
[11:46:09] <_DB> lol
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> right - do that in your HTML.
[11:46:15] <robertmaxrees> not in your jquery
[11:46:30] <_DB> well its actually a form that gets up dated through ajax
[11:46:36] <_DB> for example I have 5 orders
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> but not created, right?
[11:46:57] <_DB> when I edit one that div shows up with the info of that order
[11:47:28] <_DB> yeah but the default value would be different for different order
[11:47:34] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[11:47:35] <_DB> some may be 12 other may be 3
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> .dat('name', 'value');
[11:48:14] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: hahahaha
[11:48:18] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[11:48:20] <robertmaxrees> .data
[11:48:22] <robertmaxrees> these fuckin' meds
[11:48:26] <_DB> lol
[11:48:31] <BillCriswell> .dat is so much funnier than .data
[11:49:04] <BillCriswell> if ($el.dat('value') === 3.5) { console.log('tree fiddy'); }
[11:49:09] <robertmaxrees> haha
[11:49:22] <_DB> lol
[11:51:10] <_DB> cool it works thanks bud robertmaxrees
[11:51:16] <robertmaxrees> fshosho
[12:04:32] <theshadow> http://jsfiddle.net/de2LLoa8/4/ Why isn't the alert ever firing?
[12:05:00] <robertmaxrees> fires for me.
[12:05:12] <_DB> robertmaxrees how can I change this line so it only grabs the inputs from inside a div    $('input').each(function() {
[12:05:19] <theshadow> robertmaxrees: When the page loads?
[12:05:29] <_DB> I just noticed I have other checkboxes on the page that are getting affected by this
[12:05:45] <robertmaxrees> theshadow nope - the handler is bound after the code runs.,
[12:06:02] <theshadow> haderp
[12:06:04] <theshadow> that is so obvious
[12:06:08] <_DB> lol
[12:06:10] <robertmaxrees> _DB okay
[12:08:33] <_DB> is it  $('#div_id  :input').each(function() {
[12:08:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:09:17] <_DB>  $('input').each(function() {   how can I only grab each input inside a particular div
[12:09:31] <NoiseEee> $('#someDivID input')
[12:09:31] <robertmaxrees> select throguh a parent container.
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> give them all a class.
[12:09:35] <robertmaxrees> whatever.
[12:09:38] <robertmaxrees> same way with CSS>
[12:09:47] <_DB> ahh
[12:09:48] <_DB> k
[12:09:51] <NoiseEee> or someDivReference.find('input')
[12:10:28] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[12:10:55] <_DB> ok
[13:13:12] <sodacrunch> anyone ever had issues with scrolltop items in a scrollable div?
[13:13:19] <sodacrunch> I cant get it to scroll to the right position
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> why not
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:15:02] <sodacrunch> no idea
[13:15:17] <robertmaxrees> (show us the problem)
[13:15:23] <sodacrunch> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/azZEmx
[13:15:42] <sodacrunch> on the result part, if you go down to where you see the locations, johns creek, brookhaven etc etc
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> wooah.
[13:15:53] <sodacrunch> if you click those, they are supposed to expand and then scroll to the top
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> this is your entire page.
[13:17:00] <NoiseEee> sodacrunch: of what use is expanding a div and the taking the user away / scrolling to top?
[13:17:04] <NoiseEee> or is that what you're trying to fix?
[13:17:28] <sodacrunch> right now it does expand, and scroll, but it doesnt scroll to the right location
[13:17:41] <NoiseEee> why invoke any scroll at all though?
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> also, scroll_loc = $(this).attr('class').split(' ')[1]; isn't what you want.
[13:18:34] <sodacrunch> because if you click the location, it expands more info, and if it was to scroll to the top you can see it better
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> get its position().top and scroll to that.
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> sodacrunch btw end users know how to use a scrollbar
[13:20:10] <c1> Hi anyone time to help me ?
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ c1
[13:20:14] <b-ot> c1: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:20:48] <c1> Are there any jquery plugins which can be used to categorize data
[13:21:41] <c1> A bit like datatables
[13:21:46] <c1> http://www.datatables.net/examples/basic_init/zero_configuration.html
[13:21:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just use datatables?
[13:22:03] <robertmaxrees> like, what all do you need?
[13:22:20] <c1> The first column could show the same value more than once
[13:22:57] <c1> robertmaxrees: http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html
[13:23:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:23:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused.
[13:23:18] <c1> something like that but then when you expand you will see sub records to the main
[13:24:27] <c1> robertmaxrees: assume this example: http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html
[13:33:01] <c123a> http://notepad.cc/ponuffo69
[13:33:31] <c123a> would it be possible to show the above using something similar in http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html
[13:33:49] <c123a> but only show the 3 fields
[13:34:10] <c123a> then when expanded show the last 2 fields
[13:34:11] <robertmaxrees> the three unique ones?
[13:34:17] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to massage the data first i'm guessing.
[13:34:35] <c123a> Is there somewhere only where I can create the example ?
[13:34:44] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle
[13:34:45] <c123a> or do I need to get a free hosts somewhere ?
[13:34:58] <c123a> ok let me check
[13:40:08] <sodacrunch> robertmaxrees, that is what I am doing, position().top
[13:40:44] <robertmaxrees> sodacrunch do that off of the $(this) then, instead of trying to reselect the element by splitting the class attribute.
[13:51:01] <sodacrunch> robertmaxrees, I cleaned up the page http://codepen.io/anon/pen/azZEmx and changed it to this, but it still seems to have the same effect
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> where is the relevant js?
[13:53:20] <sodacrunch> at the top of the js
[13:56:18] <robertmaxrees> nonono not what i mean.
[13:58:17] <c123a> robertmaxrees: anyone combines accordion with datatables ?
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/YPWYaW
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> like thius
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> c123a dunno.
[14:03:29] <sodacrunch> robertmaxrees, thanks for the edits, I understand what you added, but for it still remains the same, does it for you as well?
[14:03:41] <robertmaxrees> it works fine for me.
[14:03:52] <robertmaxrees> wait wtf
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> oh that's why.
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> $(this).children(".location-more-container")
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> your code is very strange.
[14:07:33] <sodacrunch> how come? im selecting this' "location-more-container" which each locations div has, to expand as its hidden
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> the offset is likely happening against .locs
[14:09:19] <robertmaxrees> *position().top
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> you might have to use offset() against the clicked thing and its container and do some math to get to where you want.
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> though i still argue that you don't need the autoscroll
[14:13:17] <adfs23s> How do I detect if the user's mouse is over the right border (which has a width of a few pxs) of a given #div?
[14:14:13] <adfs23s> i think that's only possible by calculating the mouse position ...
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[14:14:24] <RTPMatt> That's how I would do it.
[14:14:33] <RTPMatt> Sounds kind of terrible.
[14:14:39] <adfs23s> lol
[14:14:46] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[14:15:08] <RTPMatt> Why not just add a second div instead of a border?
[14:15:14] <adfs23s> i was gonna say that
[14:15:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[14:15:26] <adfs23s> i'm trying to write my own splitter plugin
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:15:50] <adfs23s> i know there are ready to use solutions
[14:16:01] <adfs23s> doing it for the fun of it
[14:16:20] <adfs23s> but i will probably use option 2 instead, insert a new div
[14:16:33] <robertmaxrees> That'll give you some good styling options, too.
[14:17:15] <adfs23s>  yeha
[14:56:49] <sodacrunch> thanks robertmaxrees , robert from Art of Fighting, for Neo Geo
[14:58:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:59:42] <matthewk> i'm using find('[onclick]') to collect all of the ments with onclick attribute set. i would like to further grab the first parameter from window.open( from each of the onclick attr. could someone help me get this parameter value?
[14:59:57] <robertmaxrees> matthewk woah what
[15:00:17] <matthewk> robertmaxrees: sorry, "elements" instead of "ments"
[15:00:22] <robertmaxrees> still.
[15:00:24] <robertmaxrees> woah what
[15:00:51] <matthewk> if the onclick contains a window.open, i'd like to do some manipulation on the first parameter of window.open call
[15:00:51] <robertmaxrees> are you able to not have the onclicks?
[15:01:08] <robertmaxrees> and not parse javascript code using javascript.?
[15:01:20] <matthewk> onclick="window.open('http://...','...)
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> I understand entirely what you want to do - I'm suggesting that you don't have that kind of code in the first place.
[15:01:58] <matthewk> robertmaxrees: no, i don't have the ability to change all of the onclicks
[15:02:02] <robertmaxrees> that'
[15:02:12] <robertmaxrees> *that's really scary.
[15:02:20] <sodacrunch> robertmaxrees, you dont recall neo geo?
[15:02:27] <matthewk> robertmaxrees: i understand. it's just correcting relative paths in the window.open url
[15:02:52] <robertmaxrees> matthewk and you can't fix it server-side?
[15:02:58] <robertmaxrees> sodacrunch i recall it - no idea what you're thanking me for.
[15:03:21] <sodacrunch> robertmaxrees, for taking time to look at my problem man!
[15:03:27] <matthewk> robertmaxrees: right... that's why i need to do it on the client side after my page has loaded some other pages i don't have the ability to change
[15:03:28] <robertmaxrees> ah, okay.
[15:03:38] <robertmaxrees> matthewk that's really scary.
[15:04:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to .toString() that attribute and parse out the string youw ant.
[15:04:24] <matthewk> how to parse to get that first parameter?
[15:04:44] <matthewk> since there may be some variety in whitespace and quotes
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> regular expression
[15:05:01] <robertmaxrees> not sure exactly what that'd look like.
[15:05:17] <matthewk> that's what i expected to use, but i'm not good with regex
[15:05:29] <matthewk> maybe someone in here is
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> you'd get everything between the first and second quotes.
[15:06:16] <robertmaxrees> why not take a crack at it?
[15:07:02] <matthewk> thanks robertmaxrees for your feedback
[15:08:43] <sodacrunch> say you have a div, and inside that div you got a caption thats at the bottom with a bg color, is there a way to click the div where it does this effect, the bottom caption div grows upward and the whole div now that has that captions bg color
[15:17:37] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/blog/1938-git-client-vulnerability-announced
[15:17:49] <robertmaxrees> this is not a github clinet vulneability.
[15:17:59] <robertmaxrees> but one with git proper - update your stuff
[15:26:04] <adfs23s> Anbody know a comprehensive list of available JavaScript UI frameworks (commercial or not)?
[15:54:30] <lizzin> what is the equiv to document.querySelector('#foo')?
[15:54:38] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo')
[15:54:45] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[15:55:02] <lizzin> that creates a jQuery object
[15:55:05] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:55:14] <lizzin> hoping to get the raw element
[15:55:16] <robertmaxrees> you can do a .get(0) on that
[15:55:31] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo')[0]
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> that'll work, too.
[15:56:09] <lizzin> .get(0) worked
[15:56:18] <lizzin> thanks
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> why not sure use document.getElementById() or one of the other DOM methods?
[15:57:43] <lizzin> was just wondering how it was done in jquery
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of inefficient.
[15:58:47] <lizzin> i realize. just curious. im not actually using it
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> lolk
[16:02:59] <mx8manger> hello all
[16:03:14] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:03:30] <mx8manger> am new here i have been using jquey for couple months but first time here on irc
[16:04:07] <floatmastaflex> hey, what is the besy way to delay jquery from executing a hover event for a specific period of time?
[16:04:16] <robertmaxrees> a debounce
[16:04:24] <mx8manger> i do web development and design and working on CMS for educational and cultural and social institute in my country but i haven't finished yet
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't delay the event, you delay the callback.
[16:04:50] <robertmaxrees> floatmastaflex i use https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent for stuff like that.
[16:05:09] <floatmastaflex> thanks
[16:05:29] <mx8manger> but jquey helped make em nice welcoming page and photogallery and validation it saved my life am learning to use it slowly so hard with life stress
[16:05:51] <floatmastaflex> life stress
[16:05:57] <floatmastaflex> #lifestress
[16:06:03] <floatmastaflex> i like that
[16:06:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:06:59] <mx8manger> haha and i know its so un polite to give long introductions lol
[16:07:16] <floatmastaflex> i take it english is noyt your native language
[16:07:45] <mx8manger> but anyway i will be using this chan soon or later and i thought to know people  deeply they should have idea who i am
[16:07:52] <mx8manger> yes
[16:07:57] <mx8manger> am ARAB haha
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> mx8manger haha it's all good - not everybody is in here anyway
[16:08:17] <robertmaxrees> so I wouldn't worry about intros too much :)
[16:09:55] <floatmastaflex> robertmaxrees are debounce actions generally complicated to implement? more specificially, why is this module better than a home baked solution
[16:10:12] <robertmaxrees> hoverintent does a lot more than just debounce
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> it tries to determine what the user is intending.
[16:10:28] <mx8manger> i cant find much time to study jquey so i cannot make horrible things with like other people do with their plugins
[16:11:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:11:30] <mx8manger> am having issue building voice chat for my site i need a free plugin that use flash and does need $$$ to host on free servers any idea
[16:11:33] <floatmastaflex> ok. i will have to look into this later then. sounds like a non-trivial affair
[16:11:45] <robertmaxrees> floatmastaflex hoverintent is super easy to implement.
[16:11:50] <mx8manger> i found one but it needs services that means cash
[16:12:14] <robertmaxrees> mx8manger you're not going to find anything decent for free.
[16:12:53] <floatmastaflex> robertmaxrees sure. i just have a few more pressing things and don't want to spend an hour or two learning about it, implementing in dev, regression testing, and finally pushing it to production
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:13:09] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't take nearly that long, but OK.
[16:13:21] <mx8manger> the problem is my country is banned from paypal mastercard and even ucash and most of the trade sevices and no paypal as well so i cant rent amazon server to run strean handling services
[16:13:46] <mx8manger> the problem is reachability
[16:13:51] <robertmaxrees> mx8manger that's going to be a pretty limiting factor then.  what sort of browser support do you need?
[16:15:30] <mx8manger> 25% of my users might have chrome and maybe having the default android 4.4 androud 2,6 default browser which (IDONT know which vendor made the browser) and they are so lazy to install chrome
[16:15:54] <mx8manger> not to mention they have reachability problem for getting packages as well
[16:17:01] <robertmaxrees> your best bet is going to be WebRTC, but with that kind of browser support you're SOL
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> you're going to need a server of some kind.
[16:18:43] <mx8manger> webRTC backend service needs amazon services and payed licences right? i was reading about something like that and seems like adobe offering free but for ban on the country my users cant reach adobe unless i have to treachem about proxies and vpns
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> WebRTC can be done client-to-client
[16:19:09] <mx8manger> teachem*
[16:19:28] <robertmaxrees> basically what i'm saying is it's going to be nearly impossible for you to do what you want.
[16:19:33] <mx8manger> client to client via my isp and no payed liceneces?
[16:19:52] <nikio_> is there a way to make 12/19/2014 into a date object or something that mysql will accept?
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> mx8manger search for it.
[16:20:16] <mx8manger> niki what do you want
[16:20:16] <mx8manger> yes
[16:20:22] <mx8manger> explode and inject it lol
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ you can parse it out using the Date constructor in JS into whatever format you want.
[16:21:10] <mx8manger> nikio how are you feeding the date string to mysql via form submit or what ?
[16:22:08] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, cool i didnt notice it in the docs
[16:22:29] <nikio_> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp not there
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> don't use w3schools
[16:23:21] <robertmaxrees> use MDN
[16:24:05] <robertmaxrees> or use moment.js
[16:29:55] <nikio_> pff robertmaxrees : /
[16:29:56] <nikio_> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5133807
[16:29:59] <nikio_> look how clunky
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> oh darn.
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why we use mission.js
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> err, moment.js
[16:30:51] <nikio_> ok whats that?
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> !g moment.js
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> awww bad bot.
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> search google.
[16:31:39] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, but that will cause additional overhead
[16:31:45] <nikio_> the client will have to download al ibrary
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> then do it the clunky way.
[16:32:05] <Robdgreat> another "libraries considered harmful"
[16:32:26] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ btw the overhead for downloading something is often far more minimal than you'd think.
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> it's under 35k.  optimize a few images on your site and you'll make that up easily.
[16:33:47] <nikio_> meh ill clunk it up
[16:33:55] <nikio_> respect to my africam surfers
[16:34:00] <nikio_> *african
[16:34:04] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:34:13] <nikio_> in africa every kb counts
[16:34:25] <nikio_> like in europe 15 years ago
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> sure - is your site catering to africa?
[16:34:42] <nikio_> it caters to the world : ]
[16:34:49] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:34:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> something tells me people in africa likely won't use it, but i don't know what it is so i'll leave that alone ;)
[16:36:27] <nikio_> its a lion triangulation webapp
[16:38:08] <floatmastaflex> i have a question about settign up an $.ajax() GET to emit something (an event?) when it completes, so that other functions can monitor and respond. how exactly would i set up my code to allow for A.) this specific ajax() call to emit specific completion message/event, and B.) how would I allow my other functions to monitor for this emission?
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> you can .trigger() a custom event anywhere you want in the .done() callback.
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> but don't do that.
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> just call code you care about in the .done() callback directly.
[16:39:03] <floatmastaflex> i would think i would want to use something like .on('myspecialevent)....
[16:39:15] <floatmastaflex> i can't dothat for the sake of modularity
[16:39:21] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[16:39:26] <robertmaxrees> that's plenty modular.
[16:39:37] <floatmastaflex> in this specific case, it would lead to highly coupled code
[16:39:48] <robertmaxrees> and far less confusing - routing logic through the DOM makes for headaches later on.
[16:40:19] <robertmaxrees> i fail to see how, but OK.
[16:43:24] <floatmastaflex> you would need to see the code to understand the situation (it isn't particularly pretty, but significant refactoring is out ofthe question for the moment). so, is there a way for me to create a custom emission string in jquery?
[16:44:31] <robertmaxrees> just said how :)
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> .trigger()
[16:44:46] <floatmastaflex> thanks
[16:44:48] <robertmaxrees> there are also global ajax events, as well.
[16:44:58] <robertmaxrees> that already exist.
[16:45:17] <floatmastaflex> yeah, i know. i am hesitant to use a global one though, since other ajax stuff might be happening concurrently
[16:45:29] <robertmaxrees> the event will bubble up anyway.
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> though if you're worried about other stuff, that's fair.
[16:48:42] <floatmastaflex> while we're on the topic of emission, is it possible for the pagechange event to be emitted after an ajax GET?
[16:48:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:49:08] <robertmaxrees> oh jqm
[16:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you can always .trigger() it.
[16:49:28] <floatmastaflex> that's a good idea
[17:21:56] <dandaman> ok I've got a thinker here, I'm using foundation to pop up a content dropdown(essentially an overlay), and it is usually big enough to extend past the end of the page; I have this line, $("html,body").animate({scrollTop:$("#"+flightRequestElement).offset().bottom},"500") to scroll to the content dropdown but it jumps around not really working(unless you manually scroll down to the end of the page first), I'm assuming because the dropdown exceed
[17:56:06] <floatmastaflex> robertmaxrees .trigger() appears to "trigger" an event. it doesn't not appear to "emit" an event. what is the proper way to "emit" an event in jquery?
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[17:56:26] <robertmaxrees> nodes emit events.
[17:57:03] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding to these events?
[17:57:36] <floatmastaflex> I have an .on() function that does something when 'pagechange' occurs
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> right - on what element?
[17:58:37] <floatmastaflex> frankly, i thinki can just attach it to the whole document
[17:59:16] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[17:59:27] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter where, just that it's attached.
[17:59:48] <floatmastaflex> canb you explain what "nodes emit events" means?
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> when you click on something, that emits an event.
[18:00:18] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to that element (or a parent, even) and listen for that.
[18:00:51] <floatmastaflex> how do I tell a node to emit a specific event?
[18:00:54] <robertmaxrees> you can define your own event if you want.
[18:00:59] <robertmaxrees> trigger() it.
[18:01:34] <floatmastaflex> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[18:01:41] <floatmastaflex> trigger doesn't appear to emit events
[18:01:45] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:01:48] <robertmaxrees> it triggers them.
[18:01:52] <robertmaxrees> nodes emit events
[18:01:54] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[18:02:00] <floatmastaflex> ok
[18:02:25] <dismist-> once ive registered the cheap version of ssl to a domain (in retrospect i wanted www.domain.com), is it possible to go back and change to the www version and not have that untrusted shit in the top bar
[18:04:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pqazsgtL/ floatmastaflex
[18:04:56] <floatmastaflex> ok. sec
[18:06:34] <floatmastaflex> hm
[18:06:39] <floatmastaflex> i think i see what is happening here
[18:06:43] <floatmastaflex> ok. thanks
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[18:07:32] <floatmastaflex> yeah. that's is what i initially figured it would do. i think the event is being missed because i am no doing this inside a callback
[18:08:31] <floatmastaflex> ugh. yep
[18:12:47] <robertmaxrees> why ugh?
[18:18:07] <floatmastaflex> i jst see how this code is executing, and I don't like it
[18:18:09] <floatmastaflex> not at all
[18:18:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:18:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why i originally said to not do this.
[18:19:07] <floatmastaflex> it's not even "this." the rest of the code is super broken
[18:19:16] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:20:40] <floatmastaflex> i think i may just end up rewriting all of it
[18:20:42] <floatmastaflex> :(
[18:27:44] <nikio_> i want to do something like $.post("deletetodo", toDos[$(this).prop('id')].getTodoId(), function(result) {
[18:28:00] <nikio_> but i think it doesnt accept integers
[18:29:18] <floatmastaflex> this does not make me happt at all
[18:36:10] <aFeijo> hi folks
[18:36:41] <aFeijo> I have a click() event that shouldn't execute if the clicked element parent is a given class. But when I click a <span>, it goes thru and execute it!!!
[18:37:09] <aFeijo> I have it online in a site
[18:50:27] <nikio_> cant i do something like $.post("deletetodo", 4 , function(result) {... bla ?
[18:59:43] <user_> hi everyone

[19:00:11] <user_> is this possible with jquery?

[21:35:12] <reynierpm1> what is the right way to achieve the opposite of toggle on this code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27560199/toggle-element-on-checkbox-checked
[21:46:25] <_rgn> right way is to not use jquery
[21:46:54] <_rgn> right way with jquery, no idea, sorry
[21:50:51] <Robdgreat> ah, we have one of those.
[22:19:12] <donni> is there a way to make a thing like this : when i click a text field, it automatically check a check box
[23:45:42] <zhulikas> hey fellas
[23:46:30] <zhulikas> i was thinking here - $("#element").replaceWith("very similar element with one changed property") versus $("#element").attr("whatever")
[23:46:50] <zhulikas> would replaceWith be an abomination if i use it a lot instead of trying to optimize and change as little as possible
[23:47:25] <zhulikas> it's just that my element source is coming from server side now and it's easier to replace than to write specific commands to execute against existing element so it get's updated instead of being replaced
[23:47:47] <Uhkis> donni: .on('focus'
[23:58:49] <donni> Uhkis
[23:58:49] <donni> Uhkis
[23:58:49] <donni> thank you Uhkis
