[00:00:31] <jhsto> thanks mate
[00:00:57] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[00:02:27] <jhsto> Yep, it works now, thank Cork
[00:29:58] <rigid> isn't it faster when I call methods from an actual javascript object than using $("#myobject").method() ?
[00:39:26] <negev> hi, is there a way to make a function that returns true or false based on the result of an ajax query?  if i understand $.ajax() correctly, it creates a child thread for the request and execution continues even before it has completed.
[00:40:48] <foofoobar> Hi
[00:41:44] <foofoobar> I'm having problems with some javascript related stuff in my bootstrap project. Anyway I think it's jQuery related so I ask my question here: Inside an generated element (popover) no click events are catched.
[00:41:50] <foofoobar> Here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Auqk7/
[00:42:06] <foofoobar> When I click the button to create the popover I get an alert, but when I click inside the popover nothing happens
[00:42:18] <foofoobar> why is the .click() event not sent?
[00:43:35] <frosch> foofoobar: Use on (or delegate / live)
[00:44:17] <foofoobar> frosch: doesn't work for me either: http://jsfiddle.net/VYLfp/
[00:44:45] <foofoobar> What do you mean with "delegate / live" ?
[00:51:12] <foofoobar> ah, I noticed $('body').on("click", ".btn", function() { works
[00:52:09] <foofoobar> Can someone explain me why?
[00:55:07] <NodeX> because on() is the preffered way
[00:56:44] <NodeX> in your circumstance I would imagine that the bootstrap is creating the elements after the dom is loaded and the click's are/were bound before this happned. Using on() ensures future elements macthign the selector will happen
[01:05:08] <foofoobar> NodeX: Okay, so for the future the best way is always to use .on() ?
[01:05:35] <Cork> foofoobar: it doesn't really depend on on
[01:05:43] <Cork> its using delegated event listners
[01:05:47] <Cork> *listeners
[01:05:58] <Cork> they existed before on
[01:06:08] <Cork> (as .delegate() )
[01:06:57] <Cork> foofoobar: delegated event listeners has the effect that they can be bound before the element is added
[01:07:05] <foofoobar> ok
[01:07:13] <Cork> but for the same reason they have the problem that you have to clean them up manually
[01:07:25] <Cork> cause they'r not removed when the element is
[01:07:44] <Cork> (they are removed when the element they'r bound ON is removed, but not the one matched by the selector)
[01:08:26] <Cork> foofoobar: so it all comes down to knowing what you need in each situation
[01:08:32] <foofoobar> ok
[01:08:58] <Cork> a really good situation to use delegated event listeners is if you have many elements that need to run the same listener
[01:09:02] <foofoobar> so is a event listener on the body element a bad idea?
[01:09:06] <Cork> then its ALWAYS good to do it
[01:09:11] <Cork> not really
[01:09:14] <Cork> it might be
[01:09:32] <Cork> if you expect the listener to go away when you remove the btn element
[01:10:07] <Cork> so you want to bind it as close to the target element as you can that still exist when you run your selector
[01:11:20] <computer2000> hey how can i completely hide a div by transitioning its opacity, so that when it is hidden,  no links inside are clickable?
[01:11:50] <computer2000> i need to fade it from 75% to 0% and toggle that, but the problem is, the links remain clickable when its hidden
[01:11:52] <Cork> computer2000: you can't really
[01:12:16] <Cork> you can put an element above the one your hiding
[01:12:21] <Cork> to mask it
[01:12:22] <computer2000> Cork: workaround by moving it -10000px away as callback after transition...?
[01:12:50] <Cork> computer2000: if you just want to make it go away, use fadeOut()
[01:12:57] <Cork> or set display: none
[01:13:20] <computer2000> Cork: ok
[01:13:21] <Cork> computer2000: i thought you meant something else
[01:14:06] <computer2000> Cork: fadeOut() would be ok with fadeIn() if i could say fadeIn(0.75) ... cause i need it to fade to opacity: 0.75 and not fully visible
[01:18:40] <foofoobar> Cork: I'm getting some stuff via ajax and then I want to display this data in an element which is inside the "popover". This popover is generated dynamically, so the selector I wrote in my ajax call does not match
[01:18:46] <foofoobar> How should I delegate this?
[01:18:52] <NodeX> use on();
[01:19:11] <Cork> or add the data to the dom and bind the event listener afterwards
[01:19:31] <Cork> it depends on what your explicit case looks like
[01:20:00] <Cork> if the same event listener comes and goes but should always do the same thing
[01:20:19] <Cork> you should definitely add a static delegated event listener
[01:20:59] <Cork> if its something that happens for one element and most likely never again, binding it after you've added the dom element is prob the way to go
[01:21:05] <foofoobar> Cork: 1) Click on button XYZ opens a popover which contains some links (.choose-layer1) and a div (choose-region-tpl-layer2). On click of choose-layer1 some data via ajax is loaded and should be put in choose-region-tpl-layer2. Here is my code: https://gist.github.com/2dbe0a8b6b0c96479d10
[01:21:53] <Cork> foofoobar: it doesn't really matter how the data is added
[01:22:01] <foofoobar> The problem is that line10 does not work
[01:22:08] <Cork> its more about if the listener can be reused
[01:22:38] <Cork> foofoobar: where does #choose-region-tpl-layer2 come from?
[01:22:43] <Cork> that element that is
[01:22:50] <Cork> is it in data?
[01:22:53] <Cork> or where?
[01:22:54] <foofoobar> No
[01:23:24] <Cork> cause if its in the dom when your ajax callback runs, that code should work
[01:24:01] <foofoobar> It's in my html code and inserted into the popover: $('#choose-region').popover({ content: $('#choose-region-tpl').html() } (#choose-region is the parent of the .choose-layer1 and #choose-region-tpl-layer2
[01:24:23] <foofoobar> Yes, but it looks like the .popover() removes the elements from the dom and re-inserts them
[01:24:31] <Cork> foofoobar: do you have the live code anywhere?
[01:24:49] <foofoobar> I try to put it on jsfiddle, one moment, maybe I can do this
[01:25:14] <Cork> foofoobar: unless #choose-region-tpl-layer2 doesn't exist when your callback fires
[01:25:16] <Cork> that code should work
[01:25:24] <Cork> and if it doesn't, there isn't really anything you can do
[01:26:09] <Cork> foofoobar: your best bet is to inspect the dom and see what it looks like
[01:28:10] <foofoobar> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ZkZ2W/
[01:30:14] <kendooo> hi guys, how can i show the echo $progress into a bootstrap progress bar ? with jq ? http://pastebin.com/vyyxbWCS
[01:30:22] <kendooo> im not sure how could i do it
[01:31:34] <Cork> foofoobar: uh.. that pophover seams bloken...
[01:32:19] <Cork> foofoobar: i can't click anything inside the tooltip so...
[01:32:54] <foofoobar> Cork: oh, okay
[01:33:03] <foofoobar> Clicking inside the popover works for me
[01:33:18] <foofoobar> But maybe I should consider choose something different than this popover
[01:33:22] <foofoobar> If it's that broken
[01:34:03] <foofoobar> What browser are you using?
[01:34:03] <Cork> ah there now it works
[01:34:18] <Cork> na i didn't load an external file it needed
[01:35:38] <Cork> aha
[01:36:07] <Cork> foofoobar: you have the content in dom, and then you send the html serialization to the plugin
[01:36:21] <Cork> when it then renders it, you get duplicate id's in your tree
[01:36:32] <foofoobar> ah, okay
[01:36:34] <Cork> that is invalid to do
[01:37:25] <foofoobar> So how to fix that? I have to pass html-content via the content: option in popover()
[01:37:29] <Cork> my recomendation would be to grab the content store it as a reference in a global variable and remove it from dom
[01:38:51] <Cork> foofoobar: so on load do window.chooseRegion = $('#choose-region-tpl').remove();
[01:39:00] <Cork> then use window.chooseRegion.html()
[01:40:40] <foofoobar> Cork: seems like it fixed it :) http://jsfiddle.net/q7WzU/
[01:40:56] <foofoobar> Cork: Is this a 'clean' way to do what I want?
[01:41:21] <Cork> foofoobar: depends if you want to keep the element for your self you should prob not add it to window.
[01:41:32] <Cork> so => var chooseRegion = $('#choose-region-tpl').remove();
[01:41:47] <Cork> but then chooseRegion is local to your scope, and no one else can reach it
[01:41:57] <Cork> so it depends on what you need
[01:42:16] <pcht>  
[01:43:00] <Cork> foofoobar: other then that, ya, its fairly clean
[01:43:50] <Cork> foofoobar: would prob have prefered if the popover plugin took a dom reference or a string instead of what it does
[01:43:54] <Cork> but... thats just me
[01:44:11] <foofoobar> okay
[01:45:26] <Cork> if it took a dom element you could just have passed it the reference and it would have been removed from the original position
[01:45:39] <Cork> that would have been the cleanest way to handle it
[01:46:18] <Cork> can't really see why they didn't do it that way
[01:51:36] <greek> How can I check if a <tr> contains a <td> with class "abc" ?
[01:53:47] <Cork> greek: by looping over them and check
[01:53:56] <greek> Cork, using hasClass ?
[01:54:00] <Cork> no
[01:54:32] <greek> $("tr").has("td.abc")
[01:54:37] <Cork> $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).find('td').hasClass('abc') })
[01:54:58] <Cork> greek: if possible you should try to set that class on the tr instead of on the td
[01:55:05] <Cork> thats how the dom is meant to work
[01:55:18] <Cork> keep the data on the outermost element that needs to know
[01:55:31] <Cork> cause looking upwards in the dom tree is cheap
[01:55:37] <Cork> looking downwards is costly
[01:55:45] <greek> understood, thanks for the insight
[01:55:45] <Cork> (you want to look downwards)
[01:56:05] <greek> huh? Don't you mean I don't want to look downwards?
[01:57:09] <Cork> exactly
[01:57:21] <Cork> you can, but if you can avoid it you want to
[01:57:47] <Cork> ex add an identifying class on the tr, and have a column identifying class on the td
[01:57:54] <Cork> and style the info from the class on the tr
[01:58:07] <Cork> and you don't have to look on the td when you want to do stuff on the tr
[01:58:16] <anli__> When I use jquery ui slider, I have problems making the slider thumb reach the endpoint
[01:58:25] <anli__> It should go to 70, but I can drag it to 69
[01:58:26] <Cork> classic!
[01:58:41] <Trisox> tripple yawn!! so tired :(
[01:58:46] <Cork> anli__: your styling the slider your self?
[01:58:59] <anli__> I have stolen a style, maybe that guy did not do a good job
[01:59:10] <greek> Cork, ok I see. thanks again
[01:59:25] <Cork> the handle needs to have a left margin thats negative half of the handle width
[01:59:30] <Cork> anli__: ^
[01:59:39] <Cork> so the center of the handle is on the value you want
[01:59:53] <anli__> I am dragging it to the end
[02:00:23] <Cork> does the slider value become 70 or 69?
[02:00:30] <Cork> in what it sets that is
[02:00:33] <Cork> not visibly
[02:00:38] <anli__> 69 if I drag fully to the right, I can slide it a pixel to the left and it becomes 70
[02:00:43] <anli__> Where it should be less actually
[02:00:47] <Cork> uh...
[02:00:52] <Cork> that doesn't make sense
[02:01:01] <anli__> Are you sure? :)
[02:01:02] <Cork> never ever seen that effect my self
[02:01:16] <Cork> and i've hacked the slider a lot over the years
[02:01:27] <anli__> The plugin is ok then?
[02:01:39] <Cork> its rock solid for me
[02:01:45] <anli__> cool
[02:02:00] <anli__> I used it for a site some years ago, it was ok back then
[02:02:10] <anli__> Maybe its easier to use it if I use step
[02:02:20] <Cork> a while back they changed from positioning and calculating the values in px to using %
[02:02:27] <Cork> that broke all old styles
[02:02:29] <anli__> ok
[02:02:44] <Cork> and made many have problems with the handle going off the right end of the slider
[02:02:50] <anli__> ok
[02:02:56] <Cork> but thats another matter
[02:03:23] <anli__> I would like to have the slider color change a bit when the slider is slided, but the background is an image
[02:03:33] <anli__> Maybe I should blend it with a semi transparent div
[02:03:40] <Cork> the change was really good though, cause that made it so the slider could scale and still position the handle on the correct position
[02:03:47] <anli__> ok
[02:04:05] <Cork> anli__: unless you care about ie8< just use gradients
[02:04:12] <Cork> its well supported today
[02:04:32] <Cork> uh sorry ie9<
[02:04:41] <Cork> it works in 9 not 8 >_>
[02:09:33] <johnathanb> Anyone used Redactor?
[02:09:41] <johnathanb> Image uploads in particular
[02:10:58] <computer2000> anyone can recommend me some plugin for this: i want to change the cursor if the mouse hovers over the left side of an image, and change it to another cursor if the mouse hovers on the right side of the image. how can i do thta?
[02:11:12] <blackspotwiggins> computer2000, css can do that
[02:11:36] <computer2000> blackspotwiggins: how do i determine if im on the right or left side of an image?
[02:12:01] <Trisox> hey blackspotwiggins
[02:13:46] <blackspotwiggins> computer2000, create an element there
[02:13:52] <Cork> computer2000: normally you wrapp the image in a container and add two overlay elements ontop of the image
[02:13:53] <blackspotwiggins> you can use :before and :after
[02:14:14] <computer2000> ok thx

[02:34:17] <nisseni> I'm having a field which has a typeahead, when this field change I want to add content to another field, however, it doesn't use the value of the field, it uses the value I typed in
[02:34:54] <nisseni> for example, I'm typing Ha, then I get the option Hawaii, I select hawaii and tab away, then it posts "Ha" instead of Hawaii...
[03:06:02] <angelazou> hi
[03:06:14] <angelazou> I noticed that sometimes functions are called with its name only
[03:06:27] <angelazou> and sometimes there are parentheses following it
[03:06:40] <angelazou> what would be the different occasions that this happens?
[03:09:00] <dabear> angelazou: functions are always called with parentheses
[03:09:34] <dabear> angelazou: they can however be passed by reference
[03:09:48] <dabear> which is what you do in .click(function(){})
[03:12:24] <angelazou> dabear: that is not true, see paste here
[03:12:26] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/WTz9Q/
[03:12:52] <dabear> angelazou: it is indeed true
[03:12:56] <angelazou> I just found out that if it's called where a lambda function would be, there must be no parentheses when calling the function
[03:13:07] <frosch> angelazou: jquery adds the () for you in that case
[03:13:09] <dabear> angelazou: as I said, its passed by reference
[03:13:10] <Larholm> angelazou, it's passed by reference so it can be invoked later
[03:13:15] <angelazou> but if the function is within the lambda function, then it has to add the parentheses
[03:13:30] <angelazou> but then why does case number 3 failed?
[03:13:31] <Larholm> just think of whether you want to invoke the function now or later
[03:13:53] <Larholm> case 3 fails because you invoke the function NOW, instead of letting jQuery invoke it when the document is ready
[03:14:09] <Larholm> you invoke it now, and jQuery tries to invoke the return value of your function when the document is ready
[03:14:22] <Larholm> and addEmphasized does not return a function which can be invoked later
[03:14:26] <angelazou> oh, so in case number 3, it's storing the function rather than triggering it?
[03:14:43] <Larholm> yes, it's storing a reference and triggering it later - when the document ready event is fired
[03:15:20] <angelazou> but doesn't calling the function with parentheses trigger it?
[03:15:31] <angelazou> like it did in case 1?
[03:16:10] <Larholm> sure it does
[03:16:43] <Larholm> in case 1, you're giving jQuery an anonymous function, which itself has one line of code - the call to trigger addEmphasized
[03:17:40] <angelazou> well, I think my question is, how did case 2 works when case 3 doesn't?
[03:18:01] <angelazou> I'm assuming that in order to trigger a function, it has to be called with ()
[03:18:16] <angelazou> in order to store the content of a function, it has to be called without ()
[03:19:09] <angelazou> but then, why does calling the function without () also cause it to be executed in case 2?
[03:21:12] <davetarmac> hey guys
[03:21:42] <davetarmac> is there a good equal column height script that people recommend?
[03:23:05] <davetarmac> Used a couple, and while they work - they don't seem to work fully, in that it sets a height but it seems to hit a ceiling, so I get the content in the longer column spilling over the footer (see this as an example: http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/advice/corporate)
[03:23:51] <davetarmac> the code I'm using is this: http://pastebin.com/bBQBE77i
[03:28:02] <pachet> angelazou: i missed the first part of your question, can you repost it?
[03:29:09] <angelazou> well, I have a script here http://jsfiddle.net/WTz9Q/
[03:29:11] <seutje> davetarmac: the script calculates the height before the image is done loading
[03:29:25] <angelazou> it's a very simple function that I'm trying to invoke in one of 4 ways
[03:29:34] <angelazou> I noticed that case 1 and 2 works
[03:29:49] <seutje> davetarmac: either give the image dimensions or wait for it to be loaded
[03:29:53] <angelazou> but my logic tells me that in order to trigger a function, it has to be called with ()
[03:29:56] <davetarmac> ah right
[03:29:56] <seutje> ?imagesloaded @ davetarmac
[03:29:56] <bot-t> davetarmac, imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[03:30:02] <angelazou> and in order to store the content of a function, it has to be called without ()
[03:30:17] <angelazou> but case 2 and 4 seems to override that logic
[03:30:21] <davetarmac> seutje: I thought that since it was document.ready then that should be fine
[03:30:41] <angelazou> pachet: and I don't really understand why it's even working in case 2
[03:30:47] <seutje> davetarmac: doc.rdy only waits for the DOM to be ready
[03:30:52] <davetarmac> ahhh
[03:31:06] <pachet> angelazou: its working in case 2 for the same reason that its working in case 1
[03:31:07] <seutje> if doc.rdy only fired after images are loaded, I'd be pissed
[03:31:25] <pachet> angelazou: in both cases, you're passing a function --without calling it-- to $()
[03:31:49] <angelazou> but, isn't a function invoked by saying funcname() ?
[03:31:51] <davetarmac> seutje: the image has dimensions
[03:32:01] <pachet> angelazou: yes, that's true
[03:32:06] <pachet> angelazou: but you don't want to invoke it yet
[03:32:07] <angelazou> and if I have a variable, say var some = funcname
[03:32:08] <davetarmac> so I guess it's the plugin script then :)
[03:32:10] <pachet> angelazou: just reference it
[03:32:11] <angelazou> this would be assignment
[03:32:21] <seutje> davetarmac: the one in the sidebar doesn't
[03:32:41] <angelazou> so you are saying that the function is assigned/referenced to the action?
[03:33:16] <pachet> angelazou: i'm saying that you can assign whatever function to whatever variable, and pass in either that variable, or an anonymous function as in case 1
[03:33:41] <pachet> angelazou: as long as jquery receives a function argument, the result will be the same insomuch as jquery will invoke that function for you
[03:33:50] <pachet> *after* the dom is ready for manipulation
[03:34:04] <pachet> notice that you're not the one invoking that function, as you tried to do in case 3
[03:36:42] <angelazou> hmmm.....I still need to re-read your reply a couple of times
[03:38:14] <davetarmac> ahhh - that one seutje :)
[03:38:21] <davetarmac> I can fix that
[03:51:01] <pedda> someone ever did a custom transition effect for iview slider ?
[04:03:53] <diverdude> If i have a variable defined inside the return this.each(function() {}); function, and i need to gain access to this variable from outside the plugin, how can i do that?
[04:06:18] <pachet> diverdude: assign it to something declared outside the .each
[04:06:49] <diverdude> pachet: and then what?
[04:06:56] <pachet> var foo = 1; $(this).each(function(){foo++;});
[04:07:06] <pachet> diverdude: and then assign to it?
[04:07:43] <diverdude> patryk: but foo is also assigned inside the plugin..how do i get access to it from outside the plugin?
[04:09:10] <pachet> who's patryk :[
[04:09:24] <pachet> diverdude: just put your variable wherever it needs to be
[04:09:42] <pachet> as long as its within the resolved scope chain of that final .each() function, you'll be able to assign to it
[04:12:27] <foofoobar> Cork: I'm binding now with an .on("change", â€¦) from an dropdown
[04:12:36] <foofoobar> the drop down is created in runtime
[04:13:40] <foofoobar> How do I get the selected now? Normaly I would use $('#mydropdown option:selected')
[04:13:51] <foofoobar> but this will not work because of the runtime generated element
[04:16:30] <seutje> foofoobar: run on on a parent element that doesn't change
[04:16:59] <foofoobar> seutje: The .on() event for the change works
[04:17:09] <foofoobar> but I'm not able to get the selected from this
[04:17:14] <seutje> like $('#form-that-is-already-in-the-document').on('change', '#mydropdown', function() {...});
[04:18:45] <foofoobar> seutje: this already works: $('body').on('change', '#choose-region-dropdown', function() { console.log("Changed", $(this).children("option")); });
[04:18:56] <foofoobar> In the console I get all option tags
[04:19:03] <foofoobar> but none of this is "selected"
[04:19:48] <seutje> foofoobar: u can use val() on the select
[04:27:09] <foofoobar> seutje: is there also an easy way to get the selected text?
[04:27:17] <foofoobar> .text() gives me the text of all elemenets
[04:27:58] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[04:28:51] <AzizLight> how can I extract the response from an ejax call. This example doesn't work for me: http://pastie.org/4746708 What is the right way to do it please?
[04:29:08] <seutje> foofoobar: http://jsfiddle.net/ZL7f2/2/

[04:33:03] <angelazou_> how can I select a table cell element that contains certain text in jquery?
[04:34:32] <angelazou_> I don't want to replace the text
[04:34:39] <angelazou_> so the .text function is not usable
[04:34:56] <angelazou_> I only want to find td elements that contain certain text node within it

[04:36:00] <angelazou_> thanks
[04:36:18] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, anyone has expierience with time event based triggers?
[04:36:23] <angelazou_> but what about the regex used in css3?
[04:36:37] <jarr0dsz> i want to execute a function on time x,y,z in the future and need a solid way to do so with jquery
[04:36:53] <jarr0dsz> and want to store the triggerment of it like queue inside the browser html
[04:38:50] <angelazou_> what does this selector means? 'tr:not([th]):even'
[04:38:59] <angelazou_> I'm a little confused on the [] part
[04:41:34] <seutje> ?attribute-selector @ angelazou_
[04:41:35] <bot-t> angelazou_, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[04:41:47] <seutje> yeah, that, but without the equals part
[04:42:02] <seutje> so it won't match <tr th="lalala">
[04:42:08] <seutje> or even <tr th>
[04:42:10] <angelazou_> seutje: it's not an attribute
[04:42:17] <angelazou_> it's clearly a parent-child relationship
[04:42:36] <seutje> [] is clearly an attribute selector
[04:42:49] <angelazou_> I know, that's why I'm confused
[04:43:57] <seutje> if it was a parent-child thing, it'd be 'tr :not(th):even'
[04:44:30] <seutje> or 'tr > :not(th):even
[04:44:39] <seutje> with a closing quote ofc
[04:49:38] <angelazou_> and this one is also pretty daunting
[04:49:39] <angelazou_> $('td:contains("Henry")').parent().find('td:eq(1)').addClass( 'highlight').end().find('td:eq(2)').addClass('highlight');
[04:50:34] <angelazou_> why would there be an end()?
[04:50:37] <angelazou_> is it like ; in jquery?
[04:55:24] <seutje> angelazou_: it's like "go back to where I was" sorta kinda
[04:55:38] <seutje> but this is kinda silly
[04:55:46] <angelazou_> ic
[04:55:58] <angelazou_> you mean the functions?
[04:57:37] <seutje> $('td:contains("Henry")').parent().find('td').slice(0, 2).addClass('highlight') seems less confusing
[04:59:06] <seutje> or $('td:contains("Henry")').parent().find('td:lt(2)').addClass('highlight') but I suppose that's less performant in qSA capable browsers
[04:59:09] <seutje> angelazou_: ^
[05:00:42] <AdamPDotty> $('td').parent().find('td') sounds like .siblings()
[05:01:27] <angelazou_> yeah, it was written to demonstrate just how flexible jquery chaining can be
[05:02:23] <RawChid> Hey, I have a form with validate(), so far so good. But now I want that validation to fail when a checkbox is not checked. The 'required:true' (as works with textinput) does not work. Any ideas?
[05:06:09] <diverdude> How can i get the complete url-string of the current loaded page using jquery?
[05:07:03] <pingec> $('#RequestForm input') is this a valid selector?

[05:13:18] <pangelovski> hi guys, does anyone know how to set the width of a button?
[05:13:45] <termite> pangelovski: is it a button element
[05:13:56] <pangelovski> its a link element with the role of a button
[05:14:50] <termite> pangelovski: do you need to do it in js or can you do it in css
[05:15:06] <pangelovski> termite: i can do both so it doesn't really matter
[05:15:18] <pangelovski> termite: ill show you the code
[05:15:38] <computer2000> how can i resize an inline img on window resize? need to constrain the original proportion img/window
[05:15:51] <pangelovski> http://pastebin.com/8cgr8eC7
[05:17:17] <termite> pangelovski: anchor tags don't have widths
[05:17:33] <termite> pangelovski: wrap it in a div
[05:18:02] <termite> pangelovski:or use a button element
[05:18:21] <pangelovski> termite: will try
[05:18:52] <guy> I have event $('a').on('click', function(e){ /* */ }); and a hyperlink <a href="" onclick="return confirm('foo');"></a>
[05:19:05] <guy> How to detect if onclick returned false?
[05:19:26] <guy> (or why does jQuery trigger on('click') at all if onclick returns false.)
[05:20:32] <b0x> why dont u just use .click?
[05:21:42] <termite> guy: since js is async the only way to do this is attach a listener to see if it bubbled up or not
[05:22:17] <termite> guy: you would need to use globals
[05:22:30] <guy> man.
[05:22:41] <blackspotwiggins> just dont use inline event handlers
[05:22:45] <blackspotwiggins> they are not supported
[05:22:51] <blackspotwiggins> and noone will help you
[05:23:05] <termite> guy:why do you need to know if it returns false
[05:24:06] <guy> termite: to stop whatever on('click', function(){  }) was supposed to do.
[05:26:27] <termite> guy: I would not do inline I would use jQuery
[05:26:31] <computer2000> how can i resize an inline img on window resize? need to constrain the original proportion img/window
[05:26:32] <guy> I did just that.
[05:26:45] <guy> https://gist.github.com/fd7e45b0d16d890379de
[05:27:02] <FiLeVeR10> is it filling the entire window?
[05:27:18] <FiLeVeR10> like this? http://cambridgearchitectural.com/
[05:28:29] <termite> guy: so the preventDefault isn't stopping the click?
[05:28:38] <guy> It does.
[05:28:42] <guy> The problem is solved.
[05:30:55] <diverdude> termite: hmmm it seems this does not refresh the page: window.location = window.location.href
[05:31:20] <blackspotwiggins> diverdude, location.reload() is too fancy for you?
[05:31:59] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins: does the supply the exact same parameters as whats in the url?
[05:32:08] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias @ diverdude
[05:32:09] <bot-t> diverdude, Try It And See
[05:32:52] <termite> window.location.href is just to get the url location.reload is to reload the page
[05:33:00] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: http://cambridgearchitectural.com is not what im trying to achieve...
[05:33:32] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: ive got a small inline img inside the window and i need to resize it proportional to the window
[05:33:35] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: do you have an example?
[05:33:48] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: not online
[05:33:54] <FiLeVeR10> the code that makes that work can apply anywhere
[05:35:48] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: you just need to get the window dimensions, calculate the size you want the image to be from that and apply the function on window resize
[05:36:06] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: im trying..
[05:38:07] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: var winH = $(window).height(); var winW = $(window).width();
[05:39:52] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: you may need a container that spans 100%height and width, position it absolute, and set z-index to like -1000, in case the $(window) isn't working in all the browsers you want it to
[05:43:09] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins: thx
[05:43:44] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: just a sec
[05:45:17] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: https://gist.github.com/3742885
[05:45:46] <computer2000> can anyone help me with this image resizing while respecting its proportions to the window: https://gist.github.com/3742885
[05:46:55] <computer2000> the problem right now is that the image gets resized way to much, its probably a calc/math issue
[05:47:15] <FiLeVeR10> how often is the window being resized?
[05:47:32] <AdamPDotty> you should save original proportions first
[05:47:55] <computer2000> FiLeVeR10: just when the user resizes it by hand
[05:48:01] <computer2000> AdamPDotty: why?
[05:48:28] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: might make more sense to use css to resize the image inside a parent container, and us jquery to resize the parent
[05:48:34] <AdamPDotty> you cant CALCULATE a new size without knowing the old
[05:48:40] <prishabh> if I want to set `sandbox=""` on an iframe, how do I go about doing it ?
[05:49:26] <FiLeVeR10> adampdotty: yes you can, you just need the proportions, not the actual values
[05:49:57] <AdamPDotty> with percentages calculating might be needless
[05:50:08] <AdamPDotty> but he hasnt got proportions
[05:51:16] <FiLeVeR10> adampdotty: just need to divide the width/height, but you don't need to know the values just how they relate
[05:51:36] <computer2000> any ideas to a solution?
[05:51:50] <anli__> If I cannot draw a slider the whole way to the right, the thumb is misplaced?
[05:51:52] <AdamPDotty> percentages are the straight way
[05:52:31] <AdamPDotty> for more we would need to know more details
[05:52:34] <FiLeVeR10> computer2000: not without seeing you code, you're vaguely asking a specific question... percentages could work bepending on how it's set up
[05:52:58] <computer2000> ok ill look into it
[05:53:01] <computer2000> thx guys
[05:54:08] <anli__> I have a slider that should max on 35, sometimes, when I drag it, its only 35
[05:54:10] <anli__> oops
[05:54:11] <anli__> 34 :)
[05:54:32] <FiLeVeR10> max it on 36 then?
[05:54:35] <FiLeVeR10> lol
[05:54:38] <anli__> :)
[05:54:41] <AdamPDotty> 35.5 :-)
[05:57:14] <pangelovski> is it possible for jquery to open native apps on mobile devices?
[05:57:19] <pom> In this jquery plugin: http://pastebin.com/ZB3N6JGN, I'm trying to scope the settings and event*-functions under $.fn.dropUpload, yet when run, all iterations are running with the latest $('element').dropUpload(); settings. Anyone with sharper eyes that can tell me what I'm missing?
[05:57:26] <timing_> anli__: perhaps the width of the slider is not dividable in 35 even pieces and fucks op the thing?
[06:02:33] <josefrichter> my take one resizing images before upload, if someone needs it. upvote & feedback much appreciated, thanks. http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4537622
[06:02:51] <tubbo> jquery.com looks awful
[06:02:54] <tubbo> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[06:02:56] <tubbo> lol
[06:03:10] <tubbo> now that i've vented, who's got JS problems ;)
[06:03:25] <ajpiano> ho man that is weird
[06:03:45] <shoky> pom: i think you want:  settings = $.extend({}, defaultSettings, userOptions);
[06:07:12] <pom> shoky: Should I still defined settings at line 43?
[06:07:15] <seutje> so many empty paragraphs
[06:07:44] <shoky> pom: yeah
[06:09:15] <pom> shoky: That did the trick. I do nut understand why, though. :)
[06:09:30] <Iszak> Anyone got any suggestions for jquery-custom-build.com ?
[06:09:56] <shoky> pom: jQuery.extend( target [, object1] [, objectN] )   Description: Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.
[06:10:19] <pom> But I don't understand how the settings object can be overwritten outside of it's scope.
[06:10:29] <ajpiano> Iszak: awesome, didn't know you did this
[06:10:34] <shoky> why outside its scope?
[06:10:40] <pom> I guess it doesn't, but don't understand.
[06:11:14] <shoky> it's scope is that $.fn.dropUpload function
[06:11:22] <shoky> its
[06:11:39] <shoky> and that's where you're overwriting and using it
[06:12:23] <pom> Does this mean that all instances of the plugin will share the queue?
[06:12:28] <pom> Right now?
[06:12:30] <shoky> no
[06:12:44] <pom> But how come they started sharing the settings object?
[06:12:48] <shoky> each time the function is called, a new settings variable is created
[06:12:57] <Iszak> ajpiano ya needed to be done.
[06:12:59] <grifx> hello
[06:13:00] <shoky> before the fix, you mean?
[06:13:04] <pom> Yes.
[06:13:12] <ajpiano> Iszak: yeah, someone else was saying they were gonna take a shot at this
[06:13:16] <grifx> var id = $('input', this).attr('id');     is correct or not ? because my IDE say that it isn't
[06:13:17] <shoky> because you were modifying defaultSettings
[06:13:22] <Iszak> ajpiano oh, whoops =x
[06:13:26] <ajpiano> but i guess you beat him to it :)
[06:13:32] <pom> shoky: Ooooh.
[06:13:37] <pom> Thanks. Got it.
[06:13:41] <shoky> np
[06:13:44] <pachet> grifx: which IDE?
[06:13:49] <seutje> grifx: what's you're IDE saying then?
[06:13:56] <grifx> Netbeans
[06:14:01] <Iszak> sounds like your IDE isn't aware of the context parameter.
[06:14:12] <grifx> property id isn't correct
[06:14:20] <seutje> o.O
[06:14:54] <seutje> can't u tell netbeans to stfu and let jshint handle it?
[06:15:18] <grifx> is it correct
[06:15:19] <grifx> ?
[06:15:21] <pachet> does it have jquery syntax checking? :[
[06:15:41] <seutje> grifx: looks ok to me
[06:15:45] <pachet> because you should probably turn that off
[06:15:56] <seutje> but I'm no IDE
[06:16:06] <Iszak> no, you're better than an IDE.
[06:16:28] <pachet> grifx: it looks ok to vim :] </vimbump>
[06:17:06] <grifx> pachet: ok
[06:17:07] <Iszak> seutje so any suggestions?
[06:17:14] <grifx> thanks everyone
[06:17:28] <seutje> Iszak: wait whaaa?
[06:17:34] <Iszak> sorry I meant ajpiano
[06:18:00] <seutje> are you trying to flatter me? :P
[06:18:04] <grifx> missing : after property id [Stopper sur une erreur] 	  var id = $('input', this).attr('id');
[06:18:21] <ajpiano> Iszak: you could probably explicate a little more in the copy of the second sentence to be clearer
[06:18:29] <grifx> i have to type ":" somewhere ?
[06:18:56] <Iszak> ajpiano care to author the copy and I'll wang it right in there.
[06:19:10] <anli__> Aha, does the width need to be 35 or 70 etc if a slider has a max of 35?
[06:19:19] <anli__> Wonder how that can be it
[06:19:44] <seutje> grifx: oh, is this in a object literal declaration?
[06:20:03] <seutje> like var foo = { var id = $('input', this).attr('id'); } ?
[06:20:10] <grifx> no ...
[06:20:19] <seutje> ok ...
[06:20:27] <grifx>             $( '.taste' ).each({                 var id = $('input', this).attr('id');
[06:20:32] <seutje> -_-
[06:20:38] <seutje> that is an object literal declaration
[06:20:44] <grifx> lol
[06:20:51] <grifx> ahh
[06:20:51] <seutje> did u mean .each(function() { ?
[06:20:59] <grifx> sorry
[06:21:05] <pachet> the IDE wins
[06:21:05] <grifx> i didn't see that
[06:21:07] <pachet> it fights for the user
[06:21:09] <seutje> you're IDE was right after all
[06:21:09] <Iszak> ajpiano or if you can open up a issue about it, all suggestions are welcome.
[06:21:17] <anli__> I get the impression that a jquery ui slider cant be dragged when the mouse pointer is outside the slider, so it cannot force the thumb to the endpoint if the mouse is outside
[06:21:28] <seutje> ?eval hi5('seutje', 'netbeans');
[06:21:37] <ajpiano> like "As of jQuery 1.8, you can use the command line to make a custom build of jQuery using the new grunt-based build system. As appealing as that is to some folks, there are others who want this power without having to open up terminal and install a bunch of new technology. That's where jquery-custom-build.com comes in."
[06:21:41] <ajpiano> Iszak: something like that ^^
[06:21:42] <stewbydoo> the javascript channel is annoying
[06:21:57] <Iszak> ajpiano perfect, thanks! in the credits/about you go :D
[06:22:01] <seutje> stewbydoo: try the css channel
[06:22:01] <ajpiano> :)
[06:22:20] <ajpiano> Iszak: i get why we need a site like this, but it's still so funny to me
[06:22:42] <ajpiano> "Are you someone who's hyper-vigilant about saving a few kilobytes in your frontend JS build, but also petrified of the command line?"
[06:22:53] <seutje> Iszak: do you cache builds?
[06:22:55] <ajpiano> "THEN DO WE HAVE THE UNICORN FOR YOU"
[06:23:07] <Iszak> seutje v2, I only quickly hacked this together.
[06:23:12] <pachet> ajpiano: i'm going door to door to make you this exclusive offer
[06:23:12] <seutje> since u only have a handful of combinations
[06:23:22] <seutje> Iszak: oh, cool
[06:24:03] <eip56> mornin
[06:24:13] <seutje> ajpiano: change the button label to "conceive unicorn and make him poop the rainbows" while we're at it?
[06:24:19] <stewbydoo> seriously how the hell can you get into the javascript channel
[06:24:22] <jugstah> morning folks
[06:24:25] <anli__> If I drag a jquery ui slider fast to the max point and the mouse is leaving the slider, it does not hit max
[06:24:32] <jugstah> anyone familiary with jquery tools tabs+slideshow
[06:24:33] <jugstah> ?
[06:24:45] <stewbydoo> no
[06:24:53] <stewbydoo> well i mean I'm not
[06:25:32] <ajpiano> stewbydoo: the channel might require being authed with nickserv
[06:25:58] <stewbydoo> yea it does and I guess I am not doing it right or something
[06:26:02] <stewbydoo> cuz it's not working
[06:26:10] <ajpiano> you aren't authed :)
[06:26:23] <ajpiano> stewbydoo: luckily, you can ask nickserv for help, or ask in #freenode
[06:26:41] <seutje> yeah, nick is a swell guy
[06:26:52] <stewbydoo> I wish I was authed :(
[06:26:53] <seutje> chan is less nice :(
[06:27:05] <stewbydoo> i thought i was
[06:27:08] <ajpiano> stewbydoo: save your wishes for piles of money, etc
[06:27:10] <Morkel> Does anyone know how i can style a slider with jquery that he looks like this one https://img.skitch.com/20120918-bb16bt6yikfafccd2a2k2qdr98.jpg
[06:27:16] <pachet> ajpiano, stewbydoo: yes, you have to be registered
[06:27:31] <pachet> that's to keep the trolls out. oh wait, herm..
[06:27:42] <Iszak> ajpiano updated :) thanks
[06:27:43] <jugstah> pain in the ass.. all I want to do is to hide a tab but not the default panel itself
[06:28:00] <Iszak> ajpiano will add a URL to your site/twitter in the future, but currently need to sort out Jade.
[06:28:13] <ajpiano> Iszak: yah don't wory bout it mate
[06:28:18] <ajpiano> whenever you get a chance
[06:29:40] <seutje> Morkel: by "a slider", do you mean a native range input? or jquery UI slider or what?
[06:30:10] <Iszak> ajpiano should I add a konami code which displays unicorns?
[06:30:15] <Iszak> and rainbows
[06:30:20] <Morkel> seutje: mean a jquery range slider
[06:30:48] <Morkel> i can use slider() but it looks not like this one
[06:31:10] <seutje> Morkel: just target .ui-slider-handle then
[06:33:09] <Morkel> sente: i will try this
[06:35:38] <anli__> Its so strange, I cannot always slide to max
[06:35:57] <anli__> Is the latest version of jquery ui slider buggy?
[06:38:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[06:39:07] <ajpiano> Iszak: probably overkill :p
[06:41:24] <seutje> Iszak: can I nitpick on the margins? :P
[06:41:31] <Iszak> seutje sure
[06:42:35] <seutje> Iszak: the paragraph at the top is like hugging the form, feels kinda clunky
[06:42:59] <Iszak> it is twitter bootstrap, hmm.
[06:43:04] <Iszak> I could override it though
[06:43:53] <Iszak> seutje if you open up an issue with what you think it should be, I'll be sure remember and resolve it!
[06:52:40] <rgr> is there a shortcut to overlay one record on another e.g if one record has multiple fields including f1 and f2 and fX and I want to update those fields with {f1:v1,f2:v2,fX,vx} ?
[06:52:50] <anli__> Is there a better slider than jquery ui slider?
[06:53:01] <Cork> rgr: "record"?
[06:53:05] <Cork> you mean an object?
[06:53:25] <alvincrespo1> Does anyone know if the <video> element absorbs all events, even if you put a <div> overlay on it; such as an endcard?
[06:53:25] <rgr> yes.
[06:53:53] <Cork> rgr: so i take it you want to extend one with the keys from the other see ?.extend
[06:54:03] <Cork> <_<
[06:54:08] * Cork pokes bot-t
[06:54:16] <Cork> ah. dead again...
[06:54:33] <rgr> no. I just want those fields updated from a object which has a subset of the fields of the target.
[06:55:04] <Cork> no theres nothing for that as far as i know
[06:55:08] <anli__> Is this the same as jquery ui slider? http://egorkhmelev.github.com/jslider/
[06:55:10] <rgr> ok thanks
[06:55:15] <anli__> nm, not, I presume
[06:55:30] <Cork> anli__: whats wrong with the ui slider?
[06:55:59] <anli__> It seems to have errors
[06:56:06] <Cork> where?
[06:56:09] <anli__> I have a slider that should max on 35, but I cannot always drag to that value
[06:56:12] <anli__> It stops at 34
[06:56:21] <anli__> The I drag it a bit to the left and I get 35
[06:56:23] <Cork> can you generate an example in jsfiddle?
[06:56:32] <anli__> Should try
[06:56:54] <Cork> i suspect you meant could :)
[06:59:15] <anli__> Hm, can I include jquery ui in a jsfiddle?
[06:59:40] <Cork> sure
[06:59:45] <Cork> theres an option on the left
[06:59:59] <anli__> Should be, can only find jquery
[07:00:14] <Cork> ah its only visible in 1.7.2
[07:00:15] <Cork> not in 1.8
[07:00:18] <ajpiano> you can include any scsript you want using the "Add Resources" panel
[07:00:18] <Cork> that might be why
[07:00:27] <ajpiano> just with a url to it.
[07:00:41] <anli__> poiting to googles hosted jquery ui then?
[07:00:44] <anli__> pointing
[07:01:40] <ajpiano> that works
[07:04:31] <anli__> But the jquery ui css is not hosted by google ajax?
[07:06:14] <Cork> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/themes/base/jquery.ui.all.css
[07:06:29] <Cork> even https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery.ui.all.css
[07:06:58] <Diogo> hi what is the best way to implement array_diff por javascript..a have two array with objects and i need to discover the difference between them..
[07:07:03] <Diogo> thanks ..
[07:07:19] <anli__> I also found one, strange its not listed on https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[07:07:46] <Cork> anli__: i gave you a link up there
[07:08:16] <Cork> ah no read wrong >_>
[07:10:55] <gx> anyone here a jPlayer expert?
[07:11:08] <gx> I'm trying to figure out why jPlayer's just flat out not working in IE8, but all other browsers are fine
[07:12:45] <Kako> Hi, has anyone an idea why $('#radiobut').prop('checked', true); works but $('#radiobut').prop('checked', false); not?
[07:13:09] <Kako> Or is there a better way to unselect a radio button?
[07:13:17] <Cork> you can't uncheck a radio button
[07:13:23] <Cork> as far as i remember
[07:13:34] <Cork> thats only doable with a checkbox
[07:14:53] <Cork> Kako: if you want to move the selection check the other/one of the other option elements
[07:15:05] <Cork> uh... radio buttons...
[07:15:12] <Kako> hm, the idea ist to unselect all...
[07:15:23] <Kako> to force to user to make a selection.
[07:15:48] <anli__> Cork: done
[07:15:54] <anli__> I have a jsfiddle on http://jsfiddle.net/Epbyx/1/
[07:16:01] <anli__> The slider with "Vikt" does not always go to 35
[07:16:13] <anli__> But sometimes, it goes to 34 when I drag the slider to its end
[07:16:30] <anli__> Then dragging the slider back a bit will give me 35
[07:16:58] <Kako> Cork: Thanks anyway, so I dont need to search longer :-)
[07:17:31] <Cork> Kako: ya, have a hidden one thats "not selected" :)
[07:18:18] <Kako> Cork: hm, this could be a workaround, thanks
[07:18:20] <anli__> hm, if I use ui.value, I get it right
[07:18:45] <anli__> Instead of slider.slider('value')
[07:18:50] <Cork> Kako: ah
[07:19:11] <Cork> Kako: if you move the cursor too fast the handle stops following you
[07:19:12] <anli__> Should not slider.slider("value") be correct as well?
[07:19:32] <Cork> i suspect its cause you have it in a table
[07:19:55] <gx> http://www.voicemailsforever.com/save-voicemail/ <- could someone possibly help me figure out why the audio isn't playing when you click "hear testimonial" in IE8?
[07:20:23] <gx> I'm using jPlayer 2.1.0 and it works in all other browsers
[07:20:40] <Cork> anli__: you really shouldn't use table for markup
[07:24:20] <firstclassfunc_> I will have many templates (at least 15-20). Each template has its own file stored in /templates/* . Is it a bad idea to for the browser to perform several get requests? I cache templates (there are templates for simple things like a label& input text pair)
[07:38:30] <rgr> any recommendations for a good speech bubble type jq-ui tool?
[07:41:30] <tubbo> firstclassfunc_: i would recommend *not* making 20 GET requests for templates alone, if you don't have to.. ;)
[07:42:05] <rgr> totally depends on size and frequency
[07:42:26] <tubbo> rgr: i like bootstrap's tooltips
[07:42:45] <davetarmac> here's an interesting question - equal column heights when they contain show/hide links that toggle divs
[07:42:55] <tubbo> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips
[07:43:09] <davetarmac> obviously being hidden at time of calculation they won't be included
[07:43:54] <tubbo> davetarmac: the most interesting part about that question is the fact that it isn't a question ;)
[07:44:14] <davetarmac> tubbo: it's an implied question
[07:44:21] <tubbo> it's not
[07:44:24] <tubbo> lol
[07:44:30] <tubbo> because i have no idea what you're asking
[07:44:50] <tubbo> and therefore i can't help you
[07:45:16] <Gho5t> how to make equal height columns when it contains hidden elements?
[07:45:20] <jacoluta> http://pastebin.com/KxgUZXX5 can someone tell me why this doesnt work?
[07:45:26] <jacoluta> stopped never gets logged
[07:45:27] <davetarmac> tubbo: is there a good script to equalise column heights that also obeys show/hide elements
[07:45:36] <davetarmac> correct Gho5t :)
[07:45:46] <Gho5t> wasn't that hard : )
[07:46:17] <jacoluta> which means everything prior interval is still there
[07:46:27] <tubbo> i don't give handouts. if you need to know how to do something like that i can assist you but i'm not gonna google that for you
[07:46:28] <Morkel> I have a new problem with the slider. My range slider has only one handle
[07:46:36] <tubbo> i'm sure there is a good script somewhere
[07:46:41] <Gho5t> davetarmac: just set div a's height to div b's and make sure to update the heights when one of their hidden items are shown
[07:47:11] <tubbo> ^^
[07:47:28] <tubbo> not sure if you can do it automatically, like on an event of some kind...
[07:49:24] <Iszak> Thanks seutje :D
[07:49:49] <seutje> Iszak: hey man, if u need someone to nitpick, I'm here for u, bro :P
[07:53:24] <davetarmac> thanks Gho5t
[07:55:55] <Iszak> seutje needs to be done!
[08:11:32] <drvanon> I do not understand what is wrong with this: https://gist.github.com/3743665
[08:11:46] <drvanon> can anyone help me out?
[08:13:22] <Gho5t> keydown isn't firing?
[08:13:30] <drvanon> why wouldn't it?
[08:13:40] <Gho5t> i'm asking what your problem is
[08:13:52] <drvanon> I didn'tspecify, did I?
[08:14:04] <drvanon> I am stupid, yes you are right
[08:14:19] <drvanon> keydown does not fire and I was wondering why not.
[08:14:39] <Gho5t> well you don't have this in $(document).ready()
[08:14:46] <drvanon> I copied this from a fiddle where the near exact same thing worked
[08:14:54] <drvanon> I see,
[08:15:03] <drvanon> but why would it need to be in there?
[08:15:42] <Gho5t> because
[08:20:17] <civilordergone> does anyone know a good tutorial to do ajax appending to the top of a page?
[08:22:50] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone , i try to find a way to trigger event X on time Y is that possible with jquery somehow?
[08:23:13] <jarr0dsz> placing a "queue" inside the html of the browser that executes a certain function when time Y == the current time?
[08:23:30] <jarr0dsz> basically im trying to reload some divs on certain times
[08:26:55] <Gho5t> you can use the native js timer
[08:27:27] <Gho5t> setTimeout
[08:27:45] <jarr0dsz> setInterval() was looking at that but that isent it, i try thx Gho5t
[08:27:54] <Gho5t> that would work too
[08:28:15] <jarr0dsz> Gho5t: the idea is even if user reloads page there is a  hardcoded queue with some times like 12:00
[08:28:23] <jarr0dsz> even if browser reloads at 12:00 it should trigger the event
[08:28:33] <jarr0dsz> i know that reload on exact same time would break that, but i plan to work around that somehow ;p
[08:28:41] <Gho5t> umm
[08:28:44] <jarr0dsz> im now on websockets wich is a pain cause on page reload it breaks..
[08:28:47] <Gho5t> not sure how you could do that exactly
[08:29:00] <Gho5t> actually yeah
[08:29:38] <Gho5t> just get the current time on load
[08:29:41] <Gho5t> and reset the timer
[08:29:56] <Gho5t> because it obviously won't persist if the page is reloaded
[08:30:06] <jarr0dsz> yes and then calculate.. and if the time is > then execute it even though the execution time X is past
[08:30:31] <jarr0dsz> thought of loading that "queue" in true websockets, and post back a check to the application so I know the queue is inside the clients html
[08:30:39] <jarr0dsz> if not i could again load it in on a browser reload
[08:30:50] <jarr0dsz> not sure if i have tackled all aspects but this seems like a good way to solve the issue
[08:31:05] <jarr0dsz> have been thinking of a solution for quite some time now ;(
[08:31:18] <Gho5t> i actually haven't used web sockets much
[08:31:25] <Gho5t> well at all
[08:31:40] <wingy> me loving jQuery
[08:31:43] <Gho5t> how would you use them in this aspect?
[08:31:44] <wingy> will happen
[08:32:51] <jarr0dsz> well websockets send data to a "channel" that listens, and then reload a div
[08:32:58] <jarr0dsz> its a real pain though i have it implemented but its not solid
[08:33:18] <jarr0dsz> could use some websocket callback stuff but thtas not solid i try to move the functionality to the client now
[08:33:37] <jarr0dsz> combinding the 2 using some checks so it will load the right stuff in -always-
[08:34:38] <Gho5t> jarr0dsz	well websockets send data to a "channel" that listens, and then reload a div
[08:34:44] <Gho5t> couldn't you use ajax for this?
[08:35:23] <jarr0dsz> trying to get something together although this isent working http://jsfiddle.net/5fuLm/
[08:35:38] <jarr0dsz> does jsfiddle run ok the late time? last time used it was very buggy and slow
[08:35:59] <jarr0dsz> Gho5t: yes i can use ajax for it and thats the id, trigger a ajax div reload on time X
[08:36:47] <very> jarr0dsz, http://jsfiddle.net/very/5fuLm/1/
[08:37:39] <jarr0dsz> ah on wrap instead of onload for the jquery lib ;p thx very
[08:38:16] <very> otherwise it cannot find addDot
[08:38:56] <civilordergone> hey does anyone know a good tutorial to load posts dynamically? e.g. fb wall posts that get shown to a feed automatically
[08:39:32] <jarr0dsz> that     setTimeout('addDot()',100); just calls this every 100ms, but what if i only want to trigger an event when time  = X ?
[08:39:45] <jarr0dsz> can i still use jquery internals or would a time plugin be a better way to handle it?
[08:40:12] <very> setTimeout('addDot()',100);   calls it ONCE after 100ms.
[08:40:16] <jarr0dsz> also im concerned about timezones etc.. how could i get a uniform timing between the server application and the jquery code? anyone has some expierience in that field
[08:40:34] <jarr0dsz> very: yes every X seconds, i need it to be called ON Time X
[08:42:00] <delboy1978uk> hi guys! any idea why i would get this? Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInOutExpo'
[08:42:13] <delboy1978uk> i am trying to get a coda slider running
[08:42:25] <delboy1978uk> ive loaded jquery ui etc
[08:42:48] <very> jarr0dsz, i would suggest universal time if you're concerned about time zones.
[08:43:10] <jarr0dsz> very: universal time? sounds interesting, i could pass timezone data to jquery from my app though
[08:45:53] <delboy1978uk> sorted it was an old ui i just changed it to the google cdn
[08:46:41] <rzec> is there a way to get the response of an $.ajax request in the error callback?  I am calling a REST API that in the response it returns a JSON object with details about the error when it is an HTTP type error
[08:47:38] <jarr0dsz> hmmz is jquery even possible to trigger event on Time X, not after X seconds?
[08:47:51] <jarr0dsz> I find not a single example of trigger an event in the future, say + 2 minutes
[08:48:02] <toddWork> dilemma: i'm rebuilding a grids application that is a lot of tabular data. currently, it is the traditional html <table>. . . is there any reason to switch to  pure css?
[08:48:10] <very> jarr0dsz, setTimeout(func, 2 * 60 * 1000)
[08:48:33] <termite> rzec: how would your code even run with error codes 300-500
[08:49:03] <very> calls func in + 2 minutes
[08:49:03] <termite> rzec:http errors codes that is
[08:49:09] <delboy1978uk> rzec: wouldn'yt you just add the event into the function that runs on completion? function(event,data){console.log(data);console.log(event);}
[08:51:00] <JamesMGreene> Anyone have working experience with $.ajaxTransport?  Ours is not firing in an iPad webview (file protocol)
[08:51:07] <rzec> termite|delboy1978uk: found out what i needed to do, I just add this as the first line as my error callback : response = JSON.parse(request.responseText)
[08:51:08] <JamesMGreene> But the $.ajaxPrefilters all fire fine
[08:53:43] <very> jarr0dsz, probably there is a jquery plugin if you don't want to use setTimeout directly.
[08:53:57] <rgr> jquerybubblepopup was perfect. A great wee plugin.
[08:54:16] <jarr0dsz> very thx im already using a countdown plugin im going to use that
[08:54:45] <jarr0dsz> it throws -3,-4 seconds after event x so that would be ideal
[08:55:52] <very> jarr0dsz, but if you have a specific problem we could work out some code for it.
[08:58:41] <grifx> I want to launch a function when i keyDown the "Enter" touch
[09:02:46] <ag4ve> what is the grunt program they mention in the readme for building jquery?
[09:03:15] <JamesMGreene> gruntjs.com
[09:03:34] <grifx> what is the difference between $(function() {
[09:03:35] <grifx> and
[09:03:50] <grifx> document.ready
[09:07:32] <ag4ve> ah, found it... and it's an npm package, go figure
[09:08:02] <Jon47> grifx: well, one of them is the native DOM api method, the other is the shorthand for the jquery encapsulation
[09:08:14] <Jon47> $(document).ready(function(){
[09:08:48] <Jon47> $(document).ready(function(){  ~=  $(function(){
[09:09:25] <Jon47> if you're asking what jquery does that makes it better than calling the native API, I dunno, i'm guessing there's some browser inconsistency there that it solves behind the scenes
[09:10:10] <grifx> Jon47: thanks
[09:15:17] <alien_talk> hey does anyone know a good tutorial for php, mysql, ajax, jquery posting to a form dynamically and having hte page load /update the new data dyanmically?
[09:17:14] <Eviltwin> I think you're more likely to find that in two pieces: One that's PHP and MySQL and one that's jQuery and AJAX or one that's PHP, MySQL and AJAX and one that's jQUery
[09:17:17] <Eviltwin> jQuery*
[10:09:08] <rgr> using attribute matching whats the best selector to select all elements of class "navlink" which do not contain an a element whose attribute "href" starts with "http"? is this going the right way or ... $(".navlink").not('a[href^="http"]')
[10:09:55] <Brodingo> ?has
[10:09:56] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[10:12:04] <Brodingo> rgr $(".navlink").filter(':not(:has(a[href^="http"]))')
[10:12:10] <Brodingo> maybe
[10:13:47] <hariram> I am using jquery autocomplete plugin. I see there are two options and I am using {label: ..., value: ...} option. My label is a city name and value is city code. I want the user to select label string and show the label string in the search text box but the plugin is showing label string for hints butnot showing it in the text box. It shows citycode in the text box.
[10:19:59] <rgr> Brodingo: that indeed works, thanks. WHat are my options for regexp in that syntax? e.g suppose I want to add the condition that it also doesnt start with a non alpha character?
[10:20:41] <rgr> Also, is filter the only way or is it the bast way for that particular example?
[10:21:41] <Brodingo> filter is not actually necessary
[10:22:40] <Brodingo> but if you were to do a reg exp it would probably be best to use a filter function
[10:22:54] <rgr> using the syntax/technique above how does add an "or" condition into that lets say "doesnt begin with ? either"
[10:23:29] <Brodingo> ?filter
[10:23:29] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:23:48] <Brodingo> you can check the usage of a filter function
[10:24:37] <rgr> yes I realise I can create a filter function (looking now) but specifically using the technique you did above which isnt a explicit function per se, or is it?
[10:25:38] <Brodingo> the simplest thing would just be the selector string '.navlink:not(:has(a[href^="http"]))'
[10:26:23] <Brodingo> but to do some logic in your element filtering its likely easiest to use filter()
[10:26:38] <hariram> I am using jquery autocomplete plugin. I am using {label: ..., value: ...} option. Here label is a city name and value is city code.
[10:26:43] <rgr> yes, but I'm referrng to how to extend that method to have an additional href check. Iin this case "and does not begin with ?". Easier to use a filter function I suppose,
[10:27:13] <hariram> Need your help in achieving this: I want the user see label string at hint and show the label string in the search text box but the plugin is showing label string for hints butnot showing it in the text box. It shows citycode in the text box.
[10:27:16] <rgr> oh I could simply add another selector in the not. I'll try.
[10:27:18] <hariram> How to fix it?
[10:27:40] <Brodingo> rgr yeah maybe another :has() inside the :not()
[10:29:51] <ptizzy> using jquery mobile, i have two ui-sliders on a page, and i want them to have different background images.  nothing i've tried seems to work.  any ideas?
[10:30:05] <rgr> dont need another has : $('.navlink:not(:has(a[href^="http"],a[href^="?"]))').each(function(){log($("a",this).attr("href"));});

[10:31:36] <Tales1> Is there a way to tell if a user is pressing left Ctrl key or left Shift key or left Alt key? (I can tell they pressed Ctrl or Alt or Shift, but i can't tell if it was left or right )
[10:32:46] <Tales1> anyone?
[10:33:21] <FiLeVeR10> doubt it could be done reliably
[10:33:36] <Brodingo> yeah sounds tricky
[10:33:42] <Brodingo> maybe ask in javascript
[10:34:04] <Tales1> kk, will try there
[10:34:48] <FiLeVeR10> some browsers don't allow very good keystroke sniffing on purpose

[10:48:42] <YokoBR> hey guys, is there any way to keep refreshing the page until a <div> content is "carlos", for example?
[10:48:44] <mexitalian> i will
[10:50:08] <arielserafini> YokoBR, test for the div´s .text()
[10:50:26] <arielserafini> if it´s not carlos, call location.reload()
[10:50:41] <YokoBR> jQuery("#nome").text('carlos')
[10:51:06] <arielserafini> YokoBR, that would be setting the text to carlos, it's not what you want
[10:51:47] <arielserafini> if ($("#nome").text() !== 'carlos' ) { location.reload(); }
[10:52:38] <YokoBR> arielserafini, i have a <div id=name><h2>#randomname</h2></div>. I want that when "randomname" is "Carlos", the page stop refreshin. So it will refresh until the random name is carlos.
[10:53:08] <wingy> using ajax() i have to pass do this when sending json data: {data: JSON.stringify({username: 'foo', password: 'bar'})}
[10:53:14] <arielserafini> YokoBR, can you make a jsfiddle?
[10:53:36] <arielserafini> that code I just wrote should work, I think
[10:53:43] <wingy> is there a way to have it auto converted to json automatically?
[10:53:51] <wingy> so i can just pass an object to data?
[10:55:09] <arielserafini> wingy, I believe you can pass an object to data
[10:55:17] <arielserafini> and it'll convert it to a string anyway
[10:55:22] <wingy> arielserafini: i did but it didn't work
[10:55:31] <wingy> got an error from the server
[10:55:33] <wingy> hmm
[10:55:36] <wingy> could be a server thing though
[10:55:37] <YokoBR> arielserafini, okay
[10:55:45] <wingy> donno why it works when i stringify it
[10:55:54] <arielserafini> hmmm, that's weird
[10:55:59] <YokoBR> arielserafini, http://jsfiddle.net/BwU7Y/
[10:57:04] <wingy> arielserafini: i think i know
[10:57:14] <wingy> arielserafini: the server expects JSON data
[10:57:18] <wingy> which is a string
[10:57:40] <wingy> when POSTing data: {â€¦} then it will send it as form encoded values
[10:57:55] <arielserafini> wingy, that's weird
[10:58:02] <arielserafini> according to the ?ajax api reference
[10:58:05] <arielserafini> Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string.
[10:59:11] <wingy> username:Wingyasd
[10:59:12] <wingy> password:asd
[10:59:18] <wingy> that is what data is when sending as object
[10:59:42] <wingy> when a string it is sending:
[10:59:43] <wingy> {"username":"foo","password":"bar"}:
[11:00:05] <wingy> so .. its a difference .. i think that POSTing username and password is sending them as url encoded POST data
[11:00:19] <wingy> or whatever it is called
[11:00:51] <wingy> anyway .. good to be expliccit using JSON.stringify
[11:01:00] <wingy> it could be xml you are sending next time

[11:16:09] <Eviltwin> trollboy: .button() or .button({...}) is how you button-ify it, .button("destroy") is how you un-button-ify it

[11:31:44] <w00tner> im trying to insert this variable to a div with jquery ... the variable conatain a custon call button with jquery mobile
[11:32:06] <w00tner> the var cuponBody = $('<div align="center" id="tel"><a href="tel:'+ data[jsonID].telefono + '" data-role="button" rel="external">Llama a ' + data[jsonID].empresa + '</a></div>');
[11:32:15] <w00tner> i already tried with  $('#cupon div[data-role=content]').html(cuponBody);
[11:32:20] <w00tner> anmd with  $('#cupon div[data-role=content]').append(cuponBody);
[11:32:32] <w00tner> the button doesnt show i just show the text but it calls
[11:35:05] <w00tner> sorry for the writing im high as hell
[11:37:43] <jerone> $('#cupon div[data-role=content]').html('<div align="center" id="tel"><a href="tel:'+ data[jsonID].telefono + '" data-role="button" rel="external">Llama a ' + data[jsonID].empresa + '</a></div>');
[11:40:04] <w00tner> but i want to store it on a variable
[11:45:14] <NoiseEee> there's no <button>
[11:46:02] <jerone> $('#cupon div[data-role=content]').html(cuponBody).find("a").button();
[11:50:43] <Gates> I have a jquery script I wrote that switched out content based on two filters, they are encased in a  $(".sort-button").click(function (e) { ... }
[11:51:23] <Gates> I realized now that I need the ability to have a url #hashtag to change the 'default' state, so i wrote the needed window.location.hash to get the state initially
[11:51:38] <Gates> but i do not know how to change the click into a function that can be called from both the click and the load
[11:52:25] <Gates> Here is my code, http://pastebin.com/qzGGkfc8
[11:52:26] <Gates> any ideas?
[11:54:20] <jerone> you can make a working example at http://jsfiddle.net/

[12:02:17] <Gates> there it is
[12:02:21] <Gates> and its BROKEN
[12:02:29] <Gates> to see it NOT broken, just pull the 55 - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[12:07:37] <Gates> i think teh function order is messed up but still it does not work
[12:10:21] <Gates> jerone: any luck?
[12:12:05] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone im trying to pass a variable to a function call wich breaks the functionality
[12:12:08] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/private/xxfiwgccb6z3bemab0ojw this works
[12:12:28] <jarr0dsz> but i thought i could do reload('location') ..etc also wich fails
[12:13:24] <astropirate> jarr0dsz, load takes a callback
[12:13:48] <jarr0dsz> or "reload" is a preserved function name in jquery
[12:14:07] <jarr0dsz> how would one do it on  onExpiry: reload}  ? passing a variable
[12:14:16] <jarr0dsz> the reload is a custom function i declare myfslef
[12:23:02] <JoeCog> Hi
[12:24:42] <dabear> yo dawg
[12:25:30] <Gates> hi
[12:26:08] <JoeCog> Is a jquery book needed if I have a javascript book?
[12:26:11] <jerone> Gates: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/56/
[12:28:21] <codechewing> JoeCog: they are two different things.
[12:28:36] <Gates> jerone: is that from the without the /55/ or with, because i tihink wihtout might be wrong
[12:28:40] <Gates> or missing some
[12:29:15] <ogk1000> normally I would use jQuery to {$(this).find('span').stop().fadeTo(50, 1); ... would you guys recommend using CSS3 instead?
[12:29:16] <jerone> without, because that one worked
[12:29:19] <ogk1000> on menus that is
[12:29:27] <JoeCog> Ok. How different are they? I heard Jquery was just a framework of Javascript.
[12:29:37] <starpile> What's an easy way to do a slideToggle style hide for a side nav, so it collapses along the x axis?
[12:30:38] <Gates> jerone: im sorry, i totally messed up can i give u the other working
[12:30:52] <codechewing> JoeCog: yeah - but you'll have to understand how jquery works to use it outside of pure javascript
[12:31:12] <Gates> jerone: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/60/
[12:31:23] <Gates> thats a up-to-date working one
[12:31:54] <codechewing> starpile: the built in slideToggle is only for vertical movement
[12:32:58] <starpile> codechewing: right... I'm thinking of something like animate left -10000 or something to just drag it off the page
[12:34:32] <codechewing> starpile: you could animate the width to zero..
[12:35:04] <MarcGuay> What version of jQuery is the last version of superfish compatible with?  Alternate question:  Is there something akin to superfish which is compatible with the latest?
[12:35:08] <starpile> codechewing, that's a good thought
[12:36:17] <EclipseGc> is there a primary contributor to jquery 2.0 available to answer some questions?
[12:36:27] <EclipseGc> specifically with regard to IE8
[12:38:42] <jerone> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/62/
[12:39:03] <Gates> jerone: wow, thanks - i really appreciate it :)
[12:40:39] <Gates> jerone: it doesn't ork, chrome gives me an error on the last line - Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:41:50] <Gates> Im not sure if that does what i am looking for.. I do want the ability to have you visit the URL with (or without) a #hash at the top and it switched between Department | Services | All
[12:42:10] <Gates> which is the data-type="x" which is already created

[12:42:52] <Primer> Hi, I'm looking to load javascript files asynchronously ala jsonp (with a wrapping script that adds a callback to the delivered javascript file), but using $.ajax with dataType: 'jsonp' reaps the <script> tag. Is there some way to do this without reaping the <script> tag?
[12:43:29] <Gates> jerone: i copy and pasted that into my site's .js file and - http://cl.ly/image/3E2Y431C3c28/o just an error
[12:43:53] <albemuth> Hello, I'm looking to improve the solution for this problem: http://jsfiddle.net/UTxX9/1/
[12:43:53] <albemuth> It's basically one text input with a blur event and a button with a click event, if you focus on the input and then click the button the blur event must not be executed, my current solution uses a flag + timeOut to prevent the blur callback from being executed but maybe someone can think of a better way
[12:44:01] <Gates> jerone: could it be because the whole thing is not wrapped in a tag on my site?
[12:44:23] <jerone> Gates: must be in jQuery load
[12:44:41] <Gates> jerone: yes because fiddle does auto add it- $(window).load(function(){
[12:44:42] <jerone> Gates: but illegal charakter is mostly something else
[12:45:19] <darkfrog> does animate not call the css method when changing properties?
[12:45:57] <Gates> again- Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:46:26] <Gates> darkfrog: it calls a class yes
[12:46:44] <darkfrog> Gates: what?
[12:47:08] <Gates> darkfrog: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/62/embedded/result/#service
[12:47:10] <jerone> Gates: try ready - http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[12:47:22] <darkfrog> Gates: I'm overriding the jQuery css function to change css values in jQuery, but it's not being touched when animate is used.
[12:47:41] <Gates> darkfrog: wrong person
[12:47:46] <Gates> darkfrog:  that link was for you
[12:48:05] <Gates> jerone:
[12:48:12] <Gates> fml.
[12:48:27] <Gates> jerone: sending u site url in pm
[12:48:41] <Gates> no need to talk there, just showing u everything
[12:49:22] <darkfrog> Gates: I'm not sure what I'm looking at...
[12:51:41] <darkfrog> Gates: when I invoke: $('#testDiv').animate({ top: '200px', left: '100px' }, 2000); it never seems to hit jQuery's css method to change top and left...
[12:52:19] <Gates> darkfrog: sorry i confused myself, i do not have the knowledge to help you, sorry.
[12:52:25] <darkfrog> hehe
[12:52:30] <darkfrog> anyone else?
[12:52:40] <Gates> darkfrog: is the object absolute positioned
[12:53:22] <malorie> hi. con somebody recommend me a plugin that lets me fold text with <p>s inside? all the plugins I've found so far don't allow this
[12:53:40] <darkfrog> Gates: I think you were right previously, you don't have the knowledge to help me
[12:53:53] <Gates> hehe
[12:56:33] <Zzaichik> darkfrog: Are you sure it's not being fired (verified with Dev tools  / Firebug)? Does the element exist on DOM load? Better yet, I'm not going to guess - make a working example. (jsfiddle.net) Then I can look at it and see what's going on.
[12:57:08] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: it would seem that animate doesn't use it which seems pretty odd
[12:57:24] <resharpersuxass> in juery can one interact with the print dialog
[12:58:15] <Zzaichik> darkfrog: so it's not even being fired. Alright man, well.. it could be a few different things causing that. I can't help you without seeing the code I'm afraid.
[12:58:38] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: it's fine, I worked around it, just thought it was a bit odd.
[12:58:46] <Zzaichik> yeah that's weird.
[12:58:55] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: quick google search showed that I'm not the only one seeing it.
[12:59:12] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: mostly complaints by people using cssHacks
[12:59:17] <Zzaichik> ahh
[12:59:34] <Zzaichik> darkfrog: does that element exist on dom load or are you adding it dynamically?
[13:00:01] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: dom load, but if I change the block to just move the element instead of animating it works fine
[13:00:25] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: my guess is that animate doesn't use it because of optimizations due to the real-time nature of animations
[13:00:52] <Zzaichik> hmmm - yeah that's interesting. Well I'm glad you got it to work.
[13:01:01] <darkfrog> Zzaichik: thanks anyway
[13:01:44] <jugstah> ping
[13:06:07] <Solow> http://jsfiddle.net/bdX8K/ Why is this not clearing my timeout on a second click? It in stead adds another timeout.
[13:09:43] <codechewing> albemuth: you still here?
[13:09:45] <arielserafini> Solow, you are creating a local variable called timedTimeout inside your function
[13:10:02] <arielserafini> Solow, if you remove the "var" inside the function it should work
[13:10:14] <albemuth> yes, codechewing
[13:10:16] <arielserafini> Solow, http://jsfiddle.net/bdX8K/1/
[13:10:24] <rgr> I have defined a func jQuery.fn.saveEvent which I normally call from a selector which is an "event" e.g myevent.saveEvent(). Whats the corect syntax to staically call it or rather call it with no associated selector?
[13:10:36] <codechewing> albemuth: I tried your script, the click event fires before the blur effect for me..
[13:10:47] <Solow> arielserafini: fail... thanks.
[13:10:51] <arielserafini> :)
[13:11:42] <albemuth> the events not always get fired in the same order
[13:12:21] <albemuth> but in the case that the blur goes of first, I need a way to prevent the callback code from running
[13:12:35] <invisib> Anyone know why this isn't working? if ( $(window).scrollTop() > 200 ) { console.log('foo'); }           ??
[13:12:40] <invisib> Driving me nuts.
[13:13:30] <NoiseEee> invisib: yeah, uh try an element that isn't window.
[13:14:32] <invisib> NoiseEee: Tried $(window), $(document), $('html'), $('body'), $('.my_div'), etc. to no avail.
[13:14:32] <codechewing> albemuth: Inside of the click event handler, you could first put $('#search').unbind( 'blur' );
[13:15:34] <albemuth> that would work too, but it would still require the timeout which is the main thing I want to avoid
[13:16:43] <invisib> Any ideas guys? Blowing my brains out in a sec
[13:18:34] <ryanneufeld> invisib: do you have an event handler bound to the window scroll event?
[13:19:00] <Krambiorix> Pietertje, hang a little mat above the key you want to press
[13:19:01] <invisib> http://jsfiddle.net/x4yqU/
[13:19:08] <Krambiorix> i included jquery in my page. My page has an iframe. Do i have to include jquery in every child iframe page or can i "inherit" it from the parent?
[13:19:10] <invisib> ryanneufeld: No
[13:19:27] <invisib> I'm testing it with if
[13:19:29] <ryanneufeld> invisib: then how would you expect it to work?
[13:19:36] <invisib> I'm testing it with if
[13:19:44] <invisib> if doesn't work that way?
[13:19:49] <NoiseEee> invisib: does look like scrollTop() is very funky.
[13:20:10] <ryanneufeld> invisib: no when that code is executed
[13:20:18] <ryanneufeld> invisib: the scrolltop is 0
[13:20:22] <ryanneufeld> and then your code is done
[13:20:36] <invisib> Ah I see
[13:20:51] <invisib> So I should do a $(window).scroll or something
[13:22:06] <invisib> http://jsfiddle.net/x4yqU/1/
[13:22:08] <invisib> Thanks ryan
[13:22:13] <ryanneufeld> invisib: http://jsfiddle.net/x4yqU/2/
[13:22:13] <codechewing> albemuth: what's the jsfiddle url for this? I think you need to make use of the clearTimeout function
[13:22:47] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, can you help?
[13:22:56] <albemuth> codechewing http://jsfiddle.net/UTxX9/1/
[13:24:00] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: you should put it in the iframe documents, assuming that there is jquery-based javascript happening on those documents.
[13:24:17] <haizum> how do i return an element's x position on the page
[13:25:03] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, in all pages from the child iframe?
[13:25:38] <NoiseEee> all documents loaded into that iframe, yes
[13:25:56] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, that's a pitty
[13:26:05] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: understand they are separate documents though, right?

[13:26:41] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, yes
[13:27:00] <codechewing> albemuth: Has that updated for you?
[13:27:56] <albemuth> codechewing: no, if you update the url should change

[13:38:56] <MarcGuay> Are there versions of jquery which are not compatible with prototype 1.5?
[13:39:49] <codechewing> albemuth: I'm following you now. What's your problem with the timeout method?
[13:40:51] <albemuth> that in a normal blur (click something other than the button) there will be a small unwanted delay
[13:41:00] <wingy> can i ask a jquery mobile question in here?
[13:41:05] <wingy> the original channel is so dead
[13:42:40] <tubbo> sure wingy
[13:45:47] <codechewing> albemuth: You could attach a click event handler to the window to clear the timeout...
[13:50:51] <wingy> if you listen on 'pageinit' event it will only be fired once for each page creation
[13:51:12] <wingy> is there a way to trigger a logic when a page is entered, not just the first time
[13:51:30] <albemuth> codechewing: that wouldn't prevent the delay if clicking an element besides the button
[13:53:25] <wingy> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-beta.1/docs/api/events.html
[13:54:21] <wingy> pagechange event!
[13:57:04] <EyePulp> so I have a date string I'm trying to parse in JS - the string looks like this:   2012-09-18T16:38:29.636195+00:00   and my parser is showing this - which I believe is accurate:   Date {Tue Sep 18 2012 16:38:29 GMT-0500 (CDT)}    how's it getting the GMT offset from the +00:00 though?  or is that using my local browser/os settings?
[13:57:42] <EyePulp> it's the proper offset, btw
[14:14:36] <haizum> can someone take a look at this
[14:14:37] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/2ZLGA/
[14:15:04] <haizum> i'm trying to return the x position of my elements, which works, but only when they are scrolled
[14:15:10] <haizum> i need to get those values on page load as well
[14:15:30] <haizum> on page load they show up incorrectly
[14:15:53] <dogarrhea2> hello.  What does it mean when the debugger debugs to <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> and then it says you are in a file called /thisfileisnotajsfile/ ??
[14:19:27] <dogarrhea2> how can the doctype be counted as a line of code
[14:20:17] <Gates> Hello, I have a single page site that uses JQuery to scroll the site down, is there an easy way have navigation change on scroll, not just click?
[14:20:22] <Gates> http://makerofaweso.me/bridgestreet/
[14:21:02] <arielserafini> haizum, can you add the corresponding HTML to your fiddle?
[14:24:44] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/2ZLGA/1/
[14:24:46] <haizum> my fiddle seems to work
[14:24:56] <haizum> but on my site it doesn't :(
[14:34:27] <diverdude> How do i append a <li></li> after the first element (so in position 1) in a <ul> ?
[14:34:29] <w00tner> whats wrong with this_ mysql_query(INSERT INTO cupones (ID, NOMBRE, DIRECCION, CIUDAD, ESTADO, GIRO, TELEFONO, DESCRIPCION, TIPO, VALOR, EMAIL)

[14:37:40] <wachpwnski> w00tner:  it's not pastebin'd either.
[14:37:53] <dogarrhea2> wut does a hernia feel like?
[14:38:10] <wachpwnski> dogarrhea2:  are you a man?
[14:38:29] <dogarrhea2> yes.
[14:38:38] <wachpwnski> Much like a kick in the balls. You might have a lumb in your stomach were it is extruding your muscle wall.
[14:38:54] <dogarrhea2> also, why does the javascript debugger jump to the doctype in the html?
[14:39:30] <wachpwnski> javascript operates on DOM, why wouldn't it?
[14:39:35] <dogarrhea2> well. my stomach is one big lumps
[14:39:52] <dogarrhea2> why would it operate on the doctype. seems like there might be some bug going on
[14:40:11] <wachpwnski> doctype html ?
[14:40:28] <dogarrhea2> u know the thing that defines transitional or what not
[14:43:48] <imsky> it's a good day for jquery!
[14:45:24] <MistuhKurtz> is it imsky ?
[14:45:48] <dogarrhea2> how so?
[14:46:14] <imsky> feels like it my brothers
[15:01:15] <arielserafini> haizum: are you there?
[15:02:39] <srolfe> Is it safe to move from jQuery 1.7.2 to 1.8.0? I hear there's speed issues with 1.8.1...
[15:03:48] <srolfe> can anyone out there hear me? Or are all these users just bots?
[15:04:16] <dogarrhea2> srolfe: anyone who uses speed has issues.
[15:04:28] <arielserafini> srolfe: try it and see
[15:05:27] <srolfe> ha ha okay then
[15:09:03] <diamonds> does unbind work with multiple events like bind?
[15:09:08] <diamonds> 'one two three'
[15:09:16] <Stephen> it should
[15:10:07] <diamonds> yeah it seems to
[15:10:46] <tolborg> Im struggling with this simple "Show more"  thing: http://jsfiddle.net/tolborg/2hCf6/ <-- this works, but I dont like the approach. Anyone?
[15:10:47] <Stephen> Yup, just tried it
[15:10:58] <Stephen> looking
[15:15:28] <arielserafini> tolborg: do you need it to toggle?
[15:15:41] <tolborg> arielserafini: yeah
[15:15:53] <tolborg> arielserafini: if you mean show more/show less
[15:16:00] <arielserafini> yeah
[15:16:01] <arielserafini> okay
[15:16:21] <tolborg> .. dont worry about the text changing right now though :)
[15:16:37] <Stephen> tolborg: http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/3/
[15:16:39] <shadykhan> how can i add add a class to an element when i am on a specific spot on a page?
[15:16:41] <Stephen> Hows that?
[15:17:43] <tolborg> Stephen.. thanks, but we need to use the visuallyhidden class to hide the rows.. since fadeIn uses display:none, which cant be seen by screen readers
[15:17:54] <tolborg> â€¦ and it doesnt toggle :)
[15:17:57] <Stephen> Hmm.. ok
[15:18:03] <Stephen> I just added toggle
[15:18:08] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/4/
[15:18:11] <Stephen> But I get your point
[15:18:43] <tolborg> its for a library so the screen reader thing is really important
[15:19:21] <Stephen> Hmm... so you need data that a screen reader can read, but you need it to partially hide...
[15:19:30] <arielserafini> tolborg: do you have multiple .wrap on the same page?
[15:19:32] <tolborg> yeah
[15:19:42] <tolborg> ariels yeah
[15:20:16] <tolborg> I could introduce another class on the visuallyhidden rows
[15:20:21] <tolborg> and then just check for that
[15:20:26] <tolborg> atleast its cleaner
[15:21:23] <tolborg> like this : http://jsfiddle.net/tolborg/2hCf6/6/
[15:21:33] <arielserafini> tolborg: I can't think of a way to improve your code
[15:21:44] <arielserafini> ah
[15:21:46] <arielserafini> that works
[15:21:53] <arielserafini> but it's a matter of style
[15:21:56] <arielserafini> right?
[15:22:07] <arielserafini> no CSS pun intended
[15:22:14] <tolborg> well.. its a matter of maintenance and editor needs really :)
[15:23:06] <tolborg> arielserafini: if if was always 5 rows which would be shown, I would do everything in jquery, but the editors need to be able to select the number of rows to hide/show per default
[15:23:57] <arielserafini> well
[15:23:59] <arielserafini> one sec
[15:24:52] <tolborg> arielserafini: but you just gave me an idea!â€¦ I can still use fadeToggleâ€¦ I just add the visuallyhidden class as callback to fadeOut and then show() element again..
[15:25:10] <arielserafini> Stephen was the one who used fade
[15:25:25] <tolborg> of.. then Stephen is responsible :)
[15:25:29] <tolborg> oh even
[15:25:33] <arielserafini> but visuallyhidden doesn't work with fade, I don't think
[15:25:44] <tolborg> ofcourse it does
[15:26:33] <tolborg> arielserafini: if an element has visuallyhidden class as default.. I will hide() removeclass visuallyhidden fadeIn()
[15:26:42] <arielserafini> tolborg: http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/13/
[15:27:23] <arielserafini> er, small mistake there
[15:27:33] <arielserafini> didn't actually use the initialRows parameter
[15:27:34] <arielserafini> :P
[15:29:05] <tolborg> arielserafini: the problem is that the editors should be able to control the number of shown rows per default. Which (at least in my case) means that I have to control that in php
[15:29:11] <arielserafini> tolborg: http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/17/
[15:29:14] <arielserafini> yes
[15:29:15] <arielserafini> that
[15:29:33] <arielserafini> then you just pass that number as an argument
[15:29:35] <arielserafini> to that function
[15:29:50] <arielserafini> OR
[15:30:17] <arielserafini> one sec
[15:30:38] <tolborg> arielserafini: I would prefer not to figure out how to pass php variables to js
[15:30:45] <Biomech> hello, i would like to show "thank your for your message" after someone has submitted on my contact form. I want this to fade in without a page change - like ajax. Can you point me in the direction of some samples/tutorials?
[15:31:03] <tolborg> arielserafini: however.. I could set the number as data-rows="5"
[15:31:36] <arielserafini> tolborg: that's exactly what I was doing now
[15:31:39] <arielserafini> on your fiddle
[15:31:40] <arielserafini> :P
[15:31:57] <tolborg> it is?
[15:31:59] <tolborg> link again
[15:32:59] <Stephen> tolborg\
[15:33:01] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/20/
[15:33:06] <Stephen> later
[15:33:24] <tolborg> Stephen: dude thats ugle :D
[15:33:38] <tolborg> ugly
[15:33:46] <arielserafini> tolborg: http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/17/
[15:33:50] <arielserafini> ah
[15:33:51] <arielserafini> wrong linkg
[15:33:57] <arielserafini> http://jsfiddle.net/2hCf6/21/
[15:33:58] <arielserafini> this one
[15:34:18] <tolborg> arielserafini: bingo! thats what I want.. thanks :))
[15:35:04] <tolborg> arielserafini: butâ€¦ it introduces another layer of logic.. which is - yes cleaner - but unneccesary
[15:35:07] <arielserafini> :)
[15:35:10] <arielserafini> haha
[15:35:16] <arielserafini> well
[15:35:24] <arielserafini> you can't have everything, I guess
[15:35:38] <tolborg> arielserafini: we need the visuallyhidden class on when the page loads anyways
[15:36:49] <arielserafini> tolborg: what language is that?
[15:36:54] <tolborg> arielserafini: â€¦ inspired by your example I could do (totalNumberOfRows - VisuallyhiddenRows) = Default rows
[15:37:02] <tolborg> arielserafini: its danish
[15:37:15] <tolborg> its books :)
[15:37:26] <arielserafini> yeah, I could guess that
[15:37:44] <arielserafini> my danish is not that great though :/
[15:38:43] <tolborg> arielserafini: no reason why it should be :)
[15:40:14] <tolborg> arielserafini: thanks for helping out.. ill call it a night
[15:40:29] <arielserafini> glad to help! have a good one
[15:41:25] <mubster_> hi everyone
[15:41:38] <mubster_> any good links on writing your own widget using query ui?
[15:41:47] <mubster_> jquery*
[15:42:19] <ryanneufeld> ?widget factory
[15:42:21] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[15:42:31] <ryanneufeld> ?widget factory @ mubster_
[15:42:33] <bot-t> mubster_, UI/Developer Guide - ui.core.js provides a factory method to create widget classes. The signature is $.widget(String name, Options prototype). http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[15:42:47] <mubster_> you guys are awesome
[15:42:49] <mubster_> thank you :)
[15:43:38] <ringo> mubster_, this slideshow is pretty awesome: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[15:43:51] <ryanneufeld> ?botsnack
[15:43:51] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[15:43:59] <mubster_> that is pretty cool
[15:44:03] <mubster_> nice one
[15:44:51] <rgenito_> wow, with only a few months without using javascript/jquery... i've already forgotten so much @_@
[15:45:14] <mubster_> I've got a test to hand in tomorrow for a job
[15:45:19] <mubster_> gotta do this task
[15:45:27] <rgenito_> how does one execute some jquery code immediately on an html page? (for example... within the <script> tags?)
[15:45:29] <mubster_> where it involves me writing my own query widget
[15:45:38] <aglemann> question
[15:45:39] <rgenito_> is it $.function() { // code here }; ?
[15:45:45] <astropirate> rgenito_, wut?
[15:45:51] <mubster_> which automatically shifts throughouts tabs (the muenu)
[15:45:51] <ryanneufeld> ?ready()
[15:45:52] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[15:45:53] <mubster_> menu*
[15:45:55] <aglemann> can you use $.unbind to remove events added with $.on?
[15:45:58] <rgenito_> ahh yes, thank you so much mubster_
[15:46:05] <mubster_> and changes the centre image corresponding to the menu selected
[15:46:07] <astropirate> aglemann, use off()
[15:46:27] <Biomech> so anyone know how i can show a thanks for you message once they've hit submit and the mails sent?
[15:46:48] <aglemann> astropirate: right, but the event was applied with a newer version of jquery that uses $.on, but i only have an older version of jquery to remove the event (pre $.off)
[15:46:59] <astropirate> ahhh...
[15:47:54] <astropirate>  sure you can use unbind
[15:48:01] <astropirate> if it was a strait event handler
[15:48:06] <astropirate> if it is being delegated
[15:48:11] <astropirate> then you must use... let me look i tup
[15:48:18] <mubster_> rgenito_ you could use this dude
[15:48:19] <mubster_> var something = (function() {
[15:48:19] <mubster_>             //functions
[15:48:20] <mubster_>         })();
[15:48:25] <astropirate> undelegate
[15:48:34] <aglemann> right, ok, tks
[15:48:37] <mubster_> it will automatically call what you want inside
[15:49:04] <mubster_> obviously put that within the document ready function of course
[15:49:20] <astropirate> :O
[15:49:32] <astropirate> why put a self executing function inside of a function that is being called :S
[15:49:41] <Biomech> sigh
[15:49:57] <astropirate> Biomech, where exactly are you stuck?
[15:49:58] <mubster_> dude! I'm a noob sometimes
[15:50:01] <mubster_> lol
[15:50:03] <Biomech> forget it
[15:50:31] <mubster_> i se it fr one off purposes
[15:50:43] <mubster_> i use it for one off purposes
[15:50:54] <mubster_> still trying to master the just of it tbh
[15:51:05] <mubster_> jist*
[15:51:08] <rgenito_> thanks again mubster_  ... i have a feeling i'm going to be in here for a while until i get jquery back into my brain :)
[15:51:20] <mubster_> rgenito
[15:51:28] <mubster_> I'm not great compared to some of the guys here
[15:51:38] <mubster_> i just know bits and pieces
[15:52:18] <rgenito_> $.ready(function() { console.log('hello?'); });
[15:52:28] <rgenito_> ^-- i do not get a 'hello' in my console.log with that :( any ideas/
[15:52:31] <rgenito_> ?
[15:52:43] <johnkpaul> rgenito_: $(document).ready
[15:52:49] <rgenito_> ahhh yes
[16:01:10] <rgenito_> i'm having a problem debugging why i cannot call a function in my 'object'...
[16:01:12] <rgenito_> http://pastie.org/private/taahdkdacveocbxrefa5g
[16:01:15] <rgenito_> any ideas?
[16:01:21] <rgenito_> (console error is included on that page)
[16:03:00] <arielserafini> rgenito_: your function needs to return the function you're trying to use publicly
[16:05:34] <rgenito_> ooooh
[16:05:43] <rgenito_> i guess this is the "OOP" style of javascript, right? D
[16:05:44] <rgenito_> :D *
[16:05:53] <arielserafini> well
[16:05:55] <arielserafini> maybe
[16:06:12] <arielserafini> you can use the revealing module pattern
[16:06:18] <rgenito_> so are you saying that "RtsMain" needs to return all of the functions that will be used publicly? =\
[16:06:31] <arielserafini> yes, or use this
[16:06:39] <arielserafini> return { loadMaps: loadMaps }
[16:06:54] <arielserafini> before the end of RtsMain
[16:07:02] <rgenito_> ooooh i see
[16:07:32] <rgenito_> so at the end of RtsMain... return this; ... but if i only want to allow public access to 1 function, then "return { publicFunction : publicFunction }; " ?
[16:08:03] <arielserafini> no, not return this
[16:08:38] <arielserafini> if you want to use that function as an object, you need to return an object when the function is executed
[16:08:59] <arielserafini> and have that object's properties point to the inner functions
[16:09:01] <rgenito_> hmm, i'm lost
[16:09:04] <rgenito_> oh wait...
[16:09:17] <rgenito_> inside RtsMain... i now have properties defined as, "loadMaps = function() { ... "
[16:09:26] <rgenito_> i think that's what i was forgetting
[16:10:09] <Biomech> how do i get a div to fade in when the page loads?
[16:10:23] <blindMoe> wait for the page to load.. then fade in the image
[16:10:37] <Biomech> sigh
[16:10:42] <Biomech> fucking amazing
[16:11:04] <blindMoe> want to see something more amazing?  http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+how+do+i+get+a+div+to+fade+in+when+the+page+loads%3F
[16:11:36] <blindMoe> you can't ask a question like that and expect people to not mess with you ;)
[16:11:46] <Biomech> whatever
[16:11:53] <blindMoe> haha I bet you say that a lot
[16:12:03] <Biomech> if its not that difficult you could have just told me instead of actiing like a cunt
[16:12:17] <arielserafini> now that's some great attitude
[16:12:18] <blindMoe> you could have just asked google instead of acting like a newb idiot
[16:12:19] <arielserafini> :)
[16:12:52] <Biomech> so whats the point in asking you anything?
[16:12:56] <Biomech> or anyone in the channel
[16:13:04] <Biomech> if all youre going to say is google it

[16:13:15] <cizra> Hi! I'm rather new to JavaScript and web development in general. I'm trying to create a fancybox, but it doesn't work: the window pops up, the GET request is successful, but no HTML is displayed in the window. What might be wrong?
[16:13:21] <rgenito_> can anyone tell me how to be able to successfully call RtsMain.loadMaps(); ?
[16:13:31] <cizra> Aaaand I've asked Google already :-)
[16:13:35] <rgenito_> i'm not exactly a javascript newbie... but i forgot a lot from not using it lately
[16:13:42] <rgenito_> any tips (or repaste) would be much appreciated :)
[16:13:56] <arielserafini> rgenito_: I'm helping you, remember?
[16:14:14] <rgenito_> yay ty arielserafini :D
[16:14:35] <rgenito_> well, how do i do what you suggested? "have that object's properties point to the inner functions"?
[16:16:05] <Biomech> rgenito, apparently you have to google it yourself
[16:16:43] <Biomech> rather than answer a question, they like to repeat it back to you minus the ? and then tell you to gtfo
[16:17:00] <blindMoe> Biomech: you're an angry one aren't you?
[16:17:17] <Biomech> not really, just bored of pricks like you
[16:17:26] <blindMoe> haha
[16:17:31] <Zzaichik> haha
[16:17:31] <blindMoe> IRC anger is awesome
[16:17:37] <Biomech> yawn, whatever kid
[16:18:11] <arielserafini> rgenito_: one sec
[16:18:13] <Biomech> people come here for help and all you do is tell them to gtfo and google it
[16:18:30] <Biomech> funnily enough, we're asking becuase we cant find what we need on google
[16:18:42] <blindMoe> Biomech: I help people all the time.. if you want to flood the channel w/ your b.s. just msg me directly... some people in here have real jobs and need to get things done so they don't need to see you rant like a child
[16:19:15] <Biomech> yeah some of us have real jobs and need real help
[16:19:33] <Biomech> not your fucking google bullshit
[16:19:50] <blindMoe> you seriously asked an extremely obvious question... you would actually be done w/ what you wanted if you just clicked the link I pasted instead of ranting
[16:19:51] <ryanneufeld> Biomech: simmer down
[16:19:54] <Biomech> fuck off
[16:20:15] <ngharo> WHOA
[16:20:20] <blindMoe> like I said.. if you want to rant just /msg me instead of flooding the channel
[16:20:34] <Biomech> oh because the channel is so full of helpful discussion
[16:20:38] <ryanneufeld> Biomech: you're kinda being a baby
[16:20:46] <Biomech> people join, ask a question, get abused and leave
[16:20:57] <ryanneufeld> Biomech: sounds like you're the one abusing people
[16:20:58] <Biomech> theres been more white text in the last 2 minutes than all week
[16:20:59] <cizra> Er, I respect your wish to yell at each other, but is there any hope I'll get some help myself on this channel? Just so that I'd know whether to watch it.
[16:21:01] <arielserafini> rgenito_: http://jsfiddle.net/zLuva/
[16:21:08] <Eviltwin> Biomech: Last warning to simmer down
[16:21:12] <ryanneufeld> the first thing you said to to me was "fuck off"
[16:21:15] <Biomech> oh no!!!
[16:21:15] <rgenito_> ty arielserafini
[16:21:26] <Biomech> what you going to ban me from a channel that provides no help?
[16:21:28] <arielserafini> rgenito_: take a look, and see if you can understand
[16:21:30] <Biomech> that'll be the end of me!
[16:21:35] <Biomech> what will i do!
[16:22:08] <arielserafini> ?demo @ cizra
[16:22:09] <bot-t> cizra, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:22:11] <rgenito_> arielserafini, ooooh ok i see... i can now see already what i needed to do (i am also looking at http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/
[16:22:38] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: thanks
[16:22:56] <arielserafini> rgenito_: basically you execute the function and save its output (an object) in a variable RtsMain
[16:23:09] <CockBalls> lol fucking hell, this isn't the 90's kid
[16:23:22] <CockBalls> pathetic
[16:23:29] <arielserafini> that object is whatever you put inside that function's return statement
[16:23:33] <cizra> bot-t: I'll create a demo. Hang on.
[16:23:34] <bot-t> cizra, Friday - Documentation - jQuery - http://docs.jquery.com/action/render/JQuerySprint/demos/irclog
[16:23:59] <arielserafini> cizra: that's just a bot, but I'll take a look at your fiddle when you're done
[16:25:19] <ajpiano> wow
[16:25:29] <arielserafini> thank you, by the way, Eviltwin
[16:25:44] <Eviltwin> Yeah that guy was being super unreasonable
[16:25:49] <arielserafini> yeah
[16:25:50] <blindMoe> sorry bout that guys.. didn't realize he had 0 sense of humor
[16:25:52] <ajpiano> ysee kids, if you don't like the first answer someone gives in an IRC channel, the right way to rectify it isn't to start cursing and assuming everyone knows how "tired you are"
[16:26:02] <ajpiano> especially when you ask a bad question
[16:28:25] <Biomech[Roaming]> Like I said this yang tyre 90s
[16:28:37] <Biomech[Roaming]> Isn't the
[16:28:37] <Eviltwin> Biomech[Roaming]: Dude, seriously
[16:28:53] <Biomech[Roaming]> Seriously yourself
[16:28:57] <Eviltwin> Biomech[Roaming]: Attitude change now if you ever want help again
[16:28:58] <Biomech[Roaming]> Youre the one dragging this out
[16:29:06] <Eviltwin> You're the one who seriously overreacted
[16:29:23] <Biomech[Roaming]> I asked a simple question and got bull shit
[16:29:35] <coldhead> look we've all made mistakes and we'll all try to be better people in the future
[16:29:35] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say â€œreadâ€ to me when you wish to read it.
[16:29:38] <coldhead> let's all take 5
[16:29:42] <ryanneuf_> Biomech[Roaming]: and you think the way you're acting now makes ANY of us want to help you?
[16:30:03] <Biomech[Roaming]> Could have been answered quicker than the google crap
[16:30:03] <arielserafini> hey, at least you're paying us to help, right?
[16:30:18] <Eviltwin> Biomech[Roaming]: You need to be polite if you want help
[16:30:25] <ryanneuf_> God forbid you don't get the help you're not entitled to
[16:30:34] <Biomech[Roaming]> I was polite
[16:30:48] <ryanneuf_> the first thing you said to me was "fuck you"
[16:30:49] <Biomech[Roaming]> Apparently the solution is really easy
[16:30:58] <coldhead> let's all try to avoid using the words "is", "are" and "were"
[16:31:10] <Biomech[Roaming]> but you decided to tell me to gtfo instead
[16:31:16] <ryanneuf_> I did?
[16:31:29] <blindMoe> Biomech[Roaming]: the reason is it nice to have people check google first is because people in here deserve that ... you can't just expect people to do the research for you or hand over simple answers
[16:31:32] <Biomech[Roaming]> Did I say you?
[16:31:41] <Biomech[Roaming]> I did check google
[16:31:48] <blindMoe> we all have jobs and are busy.. we help when we can
[16:31:58] <Biomech[Roaming]> And couldn't find what I needed
[16:31:59] <arielserafini> ?fadeIn
[16:32:00] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[16:32:03] <Biomech[Roaming]> Hence I asked here
[16:32:09] <ryanneuf_> Biomech[Roaming]: then clearly losing your shit is the solution to not finding what you needed.
[16:32:09] <arielserafini> ?fadeIn @ Biomech[Roaming]
[16:32:10] <bot-t> Biomech[Roaming], .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[16:32:33] <Biomech[Roaming]> I know what fade in is, that want my question
[16:32:39] <Biomech[Roaming]> Wasn't
[16:32:40] <blindMoe> Biomech[Roaming]: the first result on the google link I gave you has the answer
[16:32:58] <Biomech[Roaming]> No it didn't
[16:33:05] <Biomech[Roaming]> Otherwise I wouldn't have asked
[16:33:16] <blindMoe> you want a div to fade in when the page loads?
[16:33:20] <arielserafini> Biomech[Roaming]: have you tried to read the jQuery docs/API?
[16:33:26] <Biomech[Roaming]> Yes
[16:33:35] <blindMoe> Biomech[Roaming]: first result of the link I pasted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218348/fade-in-div-on-page-load
[16:33:43] <ajpiano> Biomech[Roaming]: furthermore, ban evasion after getting banned for what is a completley reasonable cause is not "good behaviour." i understand the initial response you got from the first person you got may not have thrilled you, but the solution isn't to start cursing and ranting
[16:34:15] <Biomech[Roaming]> Like I said, forget it,
[16:34:59] <Biomech[Roaming]> Although to be fair it makes a change from being ignored when asking a valid question
[16:35:15] <Biomech[Roaming]> Done.
[16:35:40] <Eviltwin> And please stay out...
[16:35:41] <ajpiano> can't spell "class act" without "ass"
[16:35:51] <blindMoe> he is still here.. just as Biomech
[16:36:14] <coldhead> he's a good guy, yall should be kinder
[16:36:15] <ryanneufeld> his first question "so anyone know how i can show a thanks for you message once they've hit submit and the mails sent?"
[16:36:21] <blindMoe> anyway... sorry again
[16:36:41] <ryanneufeld> then he didn't get a response and started cursing at people... what shame
[16:36:51] <blindMoe> quality
[16:37:10] <arielserafini> to be fair he wrote "sigh" and "forget it" before cursing at people
[16:37:17] <arielserafini> like all entitled people do
[16:37:18] <ShaiTan> how do I read a cookie from an array? in my PHP code I have $_COOKIE['foo']['bar']
[16:37:22] <Eviltwin> Then he pulled out "fuck" several times and "cunt"
[16:37:30] <Eviltwin> Completely unreasonable
[16:37:46] <ryanneufeld> arielserafini even asked him where he was stuck
[16:37:48] <ajpiano> yep, it's totally fine :)
[16:37:55] <coldhead> but, he does have a point. i mean, fuck all you cunts
[16:38:05] <ajpiano> if he can come back tomorrow after the ban expires and particpate better, then that's ok
[16:38:07] <ShaiTan> good point
[16:38:10] <coldhead> you can see what he's getting at
[16:38:17] <cizra> arielserafini: {"error": "Please use POST request"} is all I get
[16:38:24] <ryanneufeld> ShaiTan: check out a library called jquery.cookie.js
[16:38:34] <ryanneufeld> ShaiTan: I've used it many many tims
[16:38:37] <ryanneufeld> &times
[16:38:43] <ShaiTan> ryanneufeld: that is needed to get a cookie value?
[16:39:14] <ryanneufeld> ShaiTan: not entirely, but it does make the process much less painful
[16:39:16] <arielserafini> cizra: that's ok, just save the fiddle so I can take a look at your code
[16:39:19] <Eviltwin> One person wasn't giving him answers that weren't particularly helpful abd he takes that as grounds for insulting a channel with over 800 people in it
[16:39:28] <Eviltwin> Rather than waiting for someone else to respond
[16:39:39] <ryanneufeld> ShaiTan: https://gist.github.com/3746748
[16:39:46] <blindMoe> even the answer I did give had his answer .. I just figured he would have a better sense of humor than he did :)
[16:39:58] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: not the first time it's happened nor will it be the last
[16:40:01] <blindMoe> I'll just not do anything next time ...
[16:40:11] <cizra> arielserafini: I can't test it to make sure it works right
[16:40:21] <cizra> arielserafini: anyhow, here it comes: http://jsfiddle.net/KhjDY/3/
[16:40:23] <Eviltwin> Yeah but that's why I don't agree with his reaction to it
[16:40:40] <ajpiano> blindMoe: guess you've now learned the perils of giving the cheeky answer :p
[16:40:46] <coldhead> behead those who insult the channel
[16:40:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: me too - that's why he's banned
[16:40:57] <ryanneufeld> gotta have thick skin on the internets
[16:40:57] <blindMoe> hehe sometimes you just have to have fun on IRC :)
[16:40:59] <someprimetime> what's the best thing to do when you inherit some code and don't understand it at all and it doesn't have any comments? (maybe like 20 lines of comments total with over 800 lines of code)?
[16:41:02] <ajpiano> anyhow
[16:41:08] <coldhead> blindMoe: don't ever change
[16:41:13] <someprimetime> and i'd rate myself as an intermediate js guy
[16:41:20] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: read it
[16:41:26] <LumberCartel> Is this the right channel to use to find out about FlowPlayer?  (I'm trying to download FlowPlayer, but the download page is empty.)
[16:41:29] <coldhead> someprimetime: read it and add the comments yourself
[16:41:30] <someprimetime> i'm honestly thinking of rewriting it
[16:41:33] <blindMoe> someprimetime: is the code minified or something?
[16:41:34] <cizra> arielserafini: Note that it's a large page with LOADS of unneccessary junk which might be interfering. It's just that both the fancybox comes up and the GET request is successful that I believe it also ought to display the page.
[16:41:41] <someprimetime> blindMoe: no but the style almost reflects that
[16:41:43] <blindMoe> I normally just go through and start commenting it myself
[16:41:48] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: honestly, that's the only way to really know. I've been there, and it sucks, but you can either rewrite it, or comment it yoruself
[16:41:55] <coldhead> or both!
[16:41:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Pick pieces of it and try to figure out what they do
[16:41:59] <someprimetime> hmm yeah
[16:42:04] <Eviltwin> Use jsbeautifier if necessary to help
[16:42:08] <Eviltwin> Then label the pieces
[16:42:13] <coldhead> ?beauty
[16:42:13] <bot-t> please beautify your horrible code at http://jsbeautifier.org <3
[16:42:22] <someprimetime> oh what the heck nice
[16:42:30] <someprimetime> thx for the link
[16:42:49] <ryanneufeld> coldhead has to use that just others won't mock him
[16:43:00] <coldhead> they mock me anyway!
[16:43:02] * coldhead cries
[16:43:13] * ryanneufeld pokes the weak weeping coldhead
[16:43:20] * ryanneufeld with a stick
[16:43:32] <coldhead> you see? THIS IS WHY I CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS
[16:43:42] <ryanneufeld> this has nothing to do with that
[16:43:48] <ryanneufeld> and you know it
[16:44:15] <coldhead> i can't have nice things because of the nosebleeds, i understand
[16:44:42] <ryanneufeld> I keep telling you not to break your toys.
[16:45:01] * LumberCartel laughs "He who dies with the most toys wins!"
[16:46:54] <cizra> arielserafini: Any hope? (I know you're not obliged to help me)
[16:51:26] <Jouva> Is there documentation about the jQuery UI draggable start and stop parameters? I don't know what event and ui point to
[17:00:30] <coldhead> Jouva: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#event-start ?
[17:00:47] <Jouva> I saw that but it provides no info as to what they hold
[17:00:53] <Jouva> it just shows they get passed
[17:01:15] <Jouva> oh wait it's on THAT part and not the event listing itself
[17:01:28] <rgr> whats the preferred way to add an element of class X if its not already added and at the same time to bind a click to it.
[17:02:03] <rgr> I could just specifically remove it first then just append and bind the click but that seems crude
[17:02:31] <coldhead> rgr: if you use on() you only have to bind it once and it will work for all matching elements that are added later
[17:02:44] <coldhead> and to test if it's already present if ($('.someclass').length)
[17:02:56] <Eviltwin> If you're using event delegation
[17:03:15] <coldhead> i'll delegate you, buddy
[17:18:09] <ShaiTan> I have a ui dialog box, works fine. But when I try to close it postcodeChangeDialog.dialog('close'); nothing happens..
[17:18:47] <ShaiTan> in fact... cannot even see anything bound to the id :(
[18:26:04] <quang> hi
[18:26:07] <rgr> whats the story with dblclick on nav links? I would like, if possible, for the click not to be processed if there is a dblclick on href links - (its for a context editor that enabled your to dblclick a link to edit the link test).
[18:26:13] <quang> i am using toggle to open a div
[18:26:27] <quang> but i have another button that opens another div but i want the original div to close too
[18:26:34] <quang> what should i call to close the first div
[18:28:23] <rgr> depends what you mean by close. remove? hide?
[18:29:16] <rgr> hmm. I'll rethink the dblclick thing. google shows it to be a mindfield. maybe shift click instead to edit the field text.
[18:29:27] <quang> hide
[18:29:58] <rgr> then $(".mydivclass").css("display","none") might do it for you.
[18:32:06] <quang> ok
[18:32:10] <quang> well i did
[18:32:15] <quang> hide("slow")
[18:32:17] <quang> seems to work
[18:51:07] <black_warlock> hello
[18:57:37] <black_warlock> someone there?
[18:58:04] <black_warlock> i wish to execute another action if somebody click yes on return confirm
[18:58:11] <black_warlock> how can I do it ?
[18:58:29] <black_warlock> onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to del this record?'); get_mylink('go_ahead.htm');"
[18:58:49] <black_warlock> why doesnt work
[18:58:59] <astropirate> black_warlock, please don't mix your javascript with your html
[18:59:18] <astropirate> black_warlock, use this: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:00:27] <McCuz> btw astropirate while we're at it.. i'm new at jquery.. is using on() faster than html methods to call js code?
[19:00:33] <McCuz> or whats the point
[19:01:03] <astropirate> McCuz, its generally a bad idea to mix your js and your html. it will become a maintainability hell
[19:01:20] <astropirate> also, with on() you have more control
[19:01:29] <McCuz> ah I see, that makes sense
[19:01:33] <astropirate> + bells and whistles
[19:01:44] <black_warlock> hum
[19:02:59] <McCuz> so what he's saying (in newbie language) black_warlock, use a unique ID for your submit button, then use http://api.jquery.com/click/
[19:03:17] <McCuz> and merge your "return confirm('Are you sure you want to del this record?'); get_mylink('go_ahead.htm');" into one function
[19:03:24] <black_warlock> i know that but
[19:03:46] <black_warlock> i use that get_mylink function in all buttons
[19:04:04] <McCuz> then use a class instead of id
[19:04:07] <black_warlock> just in the case i del one item i want to put return confirm
[19:04:23] <McCuz> and have a second class for just this one button
[19:04:28] <black_warlock> it means i have to make 2 functions insted of one
[19:05:12] <McCuz> well.. yes
[19:05:14] <black_warlock> zzzzzzzz it means a toon of lines moar
[19:05:19] <McCuz> not really
[19:05:22] <black_warlock> 2 functions
[19:05:26] <black_warlock> almost identic
[19:05:52] <McCuz> <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="getMyLink confirm" />
[19:06:28] <McCuz> you could also put it in 1 function
[19:06:38] <McCuz> that would also check if class = confirm
[19:06:52] <McCuz> and then execute the code in that if
[19:13:00] <black_warlock> like this
[19:13:01] <black_warlock> ?
[19:13:02] <black_warlock> if ($(this).attr("class","deltree")=true)) {return confirm('Are you sure you want to del this record?');}
[19:14:47] <ngharo> $(this).is('.deltree')
[19:14:59] <ngharo> $(this).hasClass('deltree')
[19:16:45] <adavia> hey guys how can i do to process a form in the same div im bringing the content?
[19:17:42] <ngharo> ?demo @ adavia
[19:17:42] <bot-t> adavia, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:17:54] <adavia> ok..
[19:18:15] <ngharo> i dont follow.. show me some sweet, sweet, code
[19:18:30] <black_warlock> yes
[19:18:33] <black_warlock> adavia
[19:18:39] <black_warlock> use .load
[19:19:32] <adavia> ok im using this function to bring up content inside a div
[19:19:33] <adavia> http://pastebin.com/ZtX5WYWg
[19:19:52] <black_warlock> $('#formdiv).load(mylink + ' #formdiv');
[19:20:09] <black_warlock> where mylink its the same page that conteins form
[19:20:10] <adavia> i need to process a form in the same div
[19:20:27] <ngharo> adavia: use .on() delegation to attach a submit handler to the form you insert
[19:21:48] <adavia> ngharo:  if i add action = myform.php it works fine but im being redirect to the page instead of being processed in the div im bringing
[19:22:32] <black_warlock> you got error on the php code then
[19:22:57] <adavia> black_warlock: should i add that before the $.ajax({
[19:23:00] <adavia> ?
[19:23:01] <ngharo> give that form an ID then $(document).on('submit', '#myForm', function() { // submit firm })
[19:23:07] <ngharo> s/firm/form/
[19:23:10] <black_warlock> omg ajax ?
[19:23:15] <black_warlock> dont need ajax
[19:24:03] <adavia> black_warlock:  if i need to bring up dinamic content from a different page ajax is the solution i guess
[19:24:39] <black_warlock> if you set the page to read a post content you can simply reload the div
[19:25:18] <black_warlock> $('#formdiv).load('page.php' + ' #formdiv');
[19:25:59] <black_warlock> and i guess your page already do that
[19:26:03] <black_warlock> to check the errors
[19:26:54] <adavia> actually when i submit it dissapears
[19:27:23] <black_warlock> you cant test it on jsfiddle
[19:27:32] <rgr> someone have a recommendation for a simple text input pop up?
[19:29:58] <black_warlock> use windows open
[19:30:01] <black_warlock> and stop
[19:30:18] <ngharo> 0_o
[19:30:29] <ngharo> window.open, rly?
[19:31:25] <black_warlock> input pop up
[19:31:42] <ngharo> rgr, plenty of dialog implementations or "fancybox" type things
[19:31:44] <ngharo> take your pick
[19:31:59] <ngharo> ?popup
[19:31:59] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[19:32:30] <black_warlock> but for a simple test?
[19:32:35] <black_warlock> text
[19:32:54] <rgr> well thats the problem. there are millions. Hence asking for a recommendation. Just want to pop up and accept some text input. I could role my own but well.. cheers anyway.
[19:34:20] <adavia> so i should do $('#formdiv).load('page.php' + ' #formdiv'); once i press submit?
[19:43:09] <black_warlock> if ($(this).hasClass('deltree')) {return confirm('Are you sure you want to del this record?'); return false;}
[19:43:34] <black_warlock> ngharo it doesnt work
[19:43:37] <black_warlock> =(
[19:44:31] <ngharo> you and your blocking code yick
[19:44:34] <RealistR> where can I past a short page (~30lines) and will someone take a look to maybe explain why the ajaxForm is not being called?

[19:47:42] <black_warlock> whats wrong
[19:48:07] <RealistR> would someone please take a look at a small webpage and provide some feedback on why the javascript may not be getting called in a form?
[19:48:20] <ngharo> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/tyUvu/
[19:48:31] <tash> not really sure what question to ask so I'll just explain the behavior and see if someone can help...
[19:49:36] <ngharo> black_warlock: how do you call my_link()
[19:49:43] <ngharo> or get_mylink() whatev
[19:49:43] <tash> I'm using the jq datepicker which works fine until I click on a checkbox in my table...it's a .on event and I know for sure that it is causing the problem b/c when I remove it, it works fine... anyways, when I click a checkbox whose purpose is to mark a job as finished, the datepicker becomes useless until the next page load.
[19:49:58] <black_warlock> onclick
[19:50:20] <ngharo> ick
[19:50:39] <tash> well, it's .on( "change", 'tr :checkbox:checked', function () { blah blah
[19:50:40] <ngharo> is mylink the href?
[19:51:50] <ngharo> ?demo @ tash
[19:51:50] <bot-t> tash, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:51:56] <black_warlock> its a dynamic vaiable
[19:52:04] <black_warlock> defined in onclick stright
[19:52:11] <black_warlock> the href its empty
[19:52:15] <black_warlock> there is a  #
[19:52:24] <ngharo> you really shouldnt use onclick in markup but if you must
[19:52:30] <black_warlock> i must
[19:52:35] <ngharo> nuh uh
[19:52:40] <black_warlock> yes hu
[19:52:48] <ngharo> no wai bro
[19:52:52] <black_warlock> XD
[19:53:11] <ngharo> black_warlock: you could shove "mylink" into data-mylink="bleh"
[19:53:15] <ngharo> instead of the onclick
[19:53:16] <haizum> i have a .hover event attached to a div, but if i rollover it with my mouse too fast, the callback (mouseout) event doesn't run
[19:53:27] <black_warlock> see
[19:53:32] <black_warlock> your doesnt work 2
[19:53:38] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/tyUvu/1/
[19:53:49] <black_warlock> i have setted another action after the return connfirm
[19:54:10] <black_warlock> and if you click yes doesnt pass to the alert
[19:54:29] <ngharo> because return exits the function
[19:54:30] <haizum> how can i prevent this?
[19:54:56] <ngharo> stop mousing so hard!
[19:55:21] <black_warlock> zzzzzzzzz
[19:55:52] <black_warlock> but the function must bring to the page to delete the record
[19:55:57] <ngharo> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/tyUvu/2/
[19:56:34] <ngharo> confirm, alert, AHHH
[19:56:52] <black_warlock> lol
[19:56:53] <black_warlock> wtf
[20:01:06] <ngharo> haizum: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDSbF/1/ i can't repro
[20:01:24] <ngharo> and i'm mousing as hard as i can
[20:01:27] <fonko> guys! im having an issue trying to show a loading gif for ajax in INTERNET EXPLORER, first time i click the damn link it works but second time it wont! and so on
[20:01:41] <black_warlock> zzzzzzzzz
[20:02:03] <fonko> im sure you guys face something like this before, i tried with .on() instead of .bind() but same thing is happening
[20:02:18] <fonko> all the other browsers are working fine!
[20:02:29] <ngharo> :(
[20:02:49] <ngharo> thankfully i dont have internet explorer within my grasp
[20:02:59] <ngharo> sorry bro
[20:03:45] <fonko> dont feel sorry for me... its bill gates who must live with that shit in his resume :P
[20:04:12] <ngharo> lol
[20:05:41] <black_warlock> Bill Gates = the biggest Virus Trader ...... fuk explorer and all developers.
[20:06:31] <fonko> true
[20:06:37] <fonko> but i must have a solution for htis!
[20:06:39] <fonko> this*
[20:06:40] <fonko> anyone?
[20:06:49] <fonko> nobody face this shit before?
[20:06:58] <fonko> i can only show this gif for loading ajax ONCE
[20:07:04] <ngharo> what triggers the loading img
[20:07:08] <fonko> next time i click... it laugh about me
[20:07:26] <ngharo> click... ok, and what happens after you click
[20:07:44] <fonko> <a href="/proyecto/Users/add" class="nav4" id="link-539176182">Sign up</a>
[20:08:10] <fonko> let me find a site where to paste the code
[20:08:13] <fonko> oen sec
[20:08:16] <ringo> put some code on jsfiddle
[20:09:23] <fonko> http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/Qp9dgxFS5l
[20:10:04] <fonko> ringo: whats that?
[20:10:22] <jrockjiggz_l> fonko: un-indented code is unreadable
[20:10:26] <fonko> im using jquery 1.7.2
[20:10:37] <fonko> sorry let me try to indent
[20:11:07] <haizum> ngharo: i had to put stop() in front of animate for it to work right
[20:11:31] <jrockjiggz_l> fonko: try changing line 2 from return false;  to   event.preventDefault();
[20:13:00] <fonko> http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/kdAmSPGbLz
[20:13:18] <fonko> jrockjiggz_l: k, let me try that
[20:14:35] <fonko> jrockjiggz_l: should i try to change al return false for that?
[20:14:46] <fonko> i have like 3 false
[20:17:15] <ngharo> maybe its something to do with animations colliding.  You could try .stop().hide().fadeIn() and .stop().show().fadeOut();
[20:17:40] <fonko> are you talking to me ngharo?
[20:18:36] <ngharo> yeah
[20:19:18] <fonko> how can i do that?
[20:19:20] <fonko> i mean
[20:19:28] <fonko> to chain the animations
[20:22:39] <ngharo> doubt its that after testing
[20:24:09] <ngharo> are the click handlers even firing at all the second time around?
[20:24:53] <fonko> how can i knwo that? its so tough to debug jquery in ie
[20:25:05] <ngharo> ie has some craptastic developer tools
[20:25:30] <fonko> that that you said is actually a good question to be made
[20:25:31] <ngharo> throw a console.log() in there before you do $.ajax()
[20:25:38] <fonko> are they firing?
[20:25:42] <fonko> ok
[20:25:50] <ngharo> or alert
[20:26:52] <fonko> like this?
[20:26:53] <fonko> function (event) {console.log(),$.ajax({beforeSend:fu
[20:27:10] <ngharo> console.log('OMG SOMETHING HAPPENED'); ..
[20:27:13] <ngharo> then you must watch the console
[20:27:29] <ngharo> or just alert('omgz') if you dont want to deal with IE dev tools
[20:27:35] <fonko> lol
[20:27:37] <fonko> ok
[20:28:15] <fonko> but where precisely?
[20:28:23] <ngharo> you had it in the right spot
[20:28:32] <fonko> k
[20:28:41] <fonko> hey man thanks for this that you are doing
[20:28:46] <fonko> i was cracking my head
[20:28:51] <fonko> hope to find a solution though
[20:29:30] <fonko> im very green with jquery
[20:31:08] <fonko> dang... still not working
[20:31:37] <ngharo> well what happens? it should pop the alert the first time when your loading image works
[20:31:48] <fonko> im gonna upgrade jquery to the last version
[20:31:52] <fonko> maybe they fixed this
[20:32:15] <ngharo> highly doubt its jquery but oke
[20:32:40] <fonko> plz if you come with something else to try let me know
[20:32:49] <ngharo> the alerts where a troubleshooting step
[20:32:56] <ngharo> what happened when you tried them
[20:34:46] <fonko> they are popping up alright
[20:34:49] <fonko> each time i click
[20:35:01] <fonko> but still, gif wont appear
[20:35:18] <fonko> its wokring with chrome and firefox, though
[20:36:08] <ngharo> change fadeIn() to show() and fadeOut() to hide()
[20:36:11] <ngharo> for funsies
[20:40:02] <fonko> same result
[20:40:10] <fonko> all other browsers are working except ie
[20:40:24] <fonko> i also have changed the version of js
[20:40:26] <fonko> to the latest
[20:40:48] <fonko> but definitely... its something else
[20:41:03] <fonko> maybe something that i should add to the css at the start?
[20:41:18] <fonko> i only have this at the css
[20:41:18] <fonko> #busy-indicator {
[20:41:19] <fonko> 	display:none;
[20:41:19] <fonko> 	
[20:41:19] <fonko> }
[20:43:38] <rodd> coding as one-man army is exhaustive
[20:44:47] <ngharo> fonko: i'm out of ideas.  would need to reproduce it to help
[20:45:20] <fonko> how can we do that? if you want of course
[20:45:25] <fonko> i can upload it
[20:45:35] <ngharo> i lack a windows puter at home
[20:45:38] <ngharo> sorry pal
[20:45:42] <fonko> hahaha
[20:45:47] <fonko> wise choice
[20:46:09] <ngharo> :)
[20:46:27] <Hiroki> Hi. I don't know if it is the correct place to ask... can someone here help with some jquery related stuff? :X
[20:47:16] <coldhead> ask your question, Hiroki :)
[20:49:19] <Hiroki> it's slightly AJAX related, but I am unsure if it is the ajax causing the issue.
[20:49:22] <Hiroki> http://pastebin.com/CEDiDDve/
[20:50:36] <Abbas|> guys, is this hierarchy notation correct? i just want to go way back from one child to the top most paretn and select the 2nd child's first inner child. jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().nth-child(1).first-child.addClass('checked')
[20:50:59] <coldhead> Hiroki: what is not working?
[20:51:03] <coldhead> you don't see the alert()?
[20:51:26] <coldhead> no Abbas| nth-child() isn't a thing
[20:51:43] <coldhead> you use that inside a selector, 'between quotes'
[20:51:43] <jrockjiggz_l> .first-child isnt a thing eithr
[20:51:45] <coldhead> it's not a fn
[20:51:53] <coldhead> word
[20:52:40] <Hiroki> everything in that code works, but i think when the ajax is complete, parent.html() does not retain it's value on the page.
[20:52:51] <Hiroki> one moment... i can upload this on my server
[20:53:04] <jrockjiggz_l> jQuery.closest('div.parent').find('<li>').eq(1).find(':first').addClass('checked') //just a guess
[20:54:02] <Abbas|> jrockjiggz , in this case, if the parent is a <li>
[20:54:12] <Abbas|> i do jQuery.closest('li.praent') ?
[20:54:20] <Abbas|> jrockjiggz_l *
[20:54:31] <coldhead> Hiroki: you think maybe the return false; isn't working, and the form is being submitted?
[20:55:23] <jrockjiggz_l> Abbas|: if your parent has class="parent" in the element
[20:55:49] <jrockjiggz_l> Abbas|: really, you would be using $(this).closest().....
[20:55:57] <Abbas|> it doesnt, its just a simple <li> <span><span> radio 1 <span><span> radio 2
[20:56:03] <Abbas|> and about 5 groups like that
[20:56:06] <jrockjiggz_l> jQuery.closest() isnt helpful
[20:56:41] <Hiroki> http://myjobsucks.co/index.php -- looky here. that parent.html() does not execute properly...
[20:56:41] <Abbas|> so if radio 1 is clicked i want to go to radio's hierarchy and put a class on radio2's span
[20:56:57] <coldhead> controversial domain name, Hiroki
[20:57:02] <Hiroki> heh
[20:57:03] <jrockjiggz_l> then, $(this).closest('li').find('span').eq(1).find('*:first').addClass('qwerty')
[20:57:22] <Abbas|> what is eq(1)?
[20:57:34] <jrockjiggz_l> ?eq @ Abbas|
[20:57:34] <bot-t> Abbas|, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:57:52] <Abbas|> ok ty
[20:57:56] <Abbas|> im going to put this knowledge to use
[20:58:20] <fonko> ?eq
[20:58:21] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:58:22] <jrockjiggz_l> Abbas|: eq(1) will use the 2nd element in the matched set
[20:58:26] <fonko> wow... nice
[20:58:36] <Abbas|> so basically
[20:58:50] <Abbas|> eq(1) will take me to li's 2nd child
[20:58:56] <Abbas|> and eq(3) to li's 3rd child
[20:59:01] <Abbas|> in this case. i.e.
[20:59:08] <jrockjiggz_l> eq(3) will get the 4th matched element
[20:59:26] <Abbas|> ah, got it
[20:59:33] <jrockjiggz_l> since i'm using .find('span').. you may have 400 spans, but .eq(1) selects the 2nd one
[20:59:49] <jrockjiggz_l> .eq(index) starts at 0
[20:59:55] <Abbas|> got that
[20:59:56] <Abbas|> ty
[20:59:58] <jrockjiggz_l> np
[21:00:06] <coldhead> Hiroki: i think you might have some other JS interfering here
[21:09:12] <coldhead> Hiroki: i would try adding href="#" to the <a>
[21:09:15] <coldhead> so it's more valid
[21:09:44] <coldhead> then if that didn't help i'd try unincluding all your other JS and readding a script at a time until you find the culprit
[21:09:56] <coldhead> i can't see it immediate;y but you have a lot in here
[21:11:53] <Hiroki> if it helps, ill uncomment something
[21:11:57] <Hiroki> one sec
[21:13:04] <Hiroki> http://myjobsucks.co/random.php
[21:13:40] <Hiroki> it works there, the html being used is very close (minus the # you suggested, and cosmetics)
[21:16:23] <coldhead> it looks like the loadData is being called again
[21:18:52] <Hiroki> slapped an alert in loadData, not it :(
[21:20:00] <coldhead> so maybe try taking out the facebook g+ stuff
[21:20:03] <coldhead> just in case
[21:21:32] <xboi209> what happens to deprecated stuff?
[21:23:59] <Hiroki> yeah, not it either x_x.
[21:26:14] <xboi209> anyone?
[21:26:49] <dragonshed> xboi209: er generally deprecated stuff is removed in future releases
[21:26:55] <xboi209> ok
[21:29:42] <xboi209> where can i find a list of deprecated stuff?
[21:31:26] <dragonshed> http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[21:32:59] <xboi209> including html and javascript?
[21:34:24] <Hiroki> wewt. going to give up.
[21:35:31] <coldhead> Hiroki: try this weirdness
[21:35:41] <coldhead> Inspect Element on the social div
[21:35:51] <coldhead> and Delete Node from the web inspector
[21:35:53] <coldhead> then vote
[21:36:02] <coldhead> and watch as the social div is magically restored
[21:36:17] <coldhead> SOMETHING is rebuilding your content
[21:38:13] <coldhead> yup, line 20 of pagaination.js is definitely being executed
[21:39:53] <Hiroki> check it out now, if you can
[21:39:59] <Hiroki> removed all social related
[21:40:18] <coldhead> it's not being caused by social
[21:40:26] <coldhead> my point is that i deleted that stuff and it got put back
[21:40:34] <coldhead> and then i found that loadData is still running
[21:41:13] <Hiroki> ah, put an alert at line 20 and it was it
[21:41:23] <coldhead> so find out what's doing that and stop it :)
[21:41:46] <Hiroki> is there a way to kill/stop/end a function abruptly, in this case ._.
[21:42:03] <coldhead> you don't want the function to run
[21:42:21] <coldhead> you must have $('a').live('click', function () {... loadData() ... }) somewhere
[21:42:36] <coldhead> you COULD add a check to loadData that makes sure it's running for the right reason
[21:42:48] <coldhead> but far better to make sure loadData only runs when it's supposed to
[21:42:56] <goddard> i have a jquery tab how can i detect if it is clicked using $("#tabs-2").click(function(){
[21:42:58] <goddard> console.log("success");
[21:43:01] <goddard> });
[21:43:03] <goddard> does nothing
[21:48:05] <coldhead> goddard: maybe you need $("#tabs-2").live('click', function(){ ...
[21:48:10] <Abbas|> jrockjiggz_l . please see this
[21:48:11] <Abbas|> http://abbaskhan.eu/s/20120919044759277.jpeg
[21:48:22] <coldhead> in case that element isn't present in the page when you bind the handler
[21:48:50] <Abbas|> jQuery(this).closest('li').find('span').eq(0).find('span').eq(0).addClass('checked') ]
[21:49:10] <Hiroki> thank you so much for your help by the way!
[21:49:12] <Abbas|> but if i try eq(1) or eq(2) etc, for the 2nd group of span, it doesnt work
[21:50:31] <jrockjiggz_l> Abbas|: that statement is saying: find the closest <li>, inside this, find all the <span>, select the fist one ( eq(0) ), inside this span, find all the spans (again), again select the first one, and addClass to that
[21:50:33] <jrockjiggz_l> gtg
[21:50:34] <jrockjiggz_l> gl!
[21:50:36] <jrockjiggz_l> `q
[21:51:01] <goddard> coldhead: no luck
[21:51:37] <coldhead> do you have a live demo, goddard?
[21:54:37] <goddard> coldhead: trying to get it working but no idea how check it out http://jsfiddle.net/
[21:56:07] <goddard> sorry here
[21:56:08] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/hhKFN/
[21:59:46] <goddard> got it working nvm
[22:04:29] <Que_> how can i submit a form in the same page i bring it up without being linked to the originall page
[22:14:24] <coldhead> goddard: http://jsfiddle.net/hhKFN/3/
[22:14:30] <coldhead> seems you can't use an ID
[22:14:35] <coldhead> but with a class that works for me
[22:14:43] <coldhead> (i secretly hate UI)
[22:15:55] <Cork> you can't use the id cause its bound to the div not the a tag
[22:16:25] <Cork> if you add an id to the a tag it should work just fine (as long as it doesn't conflict)
[22:16:59] <coldhead> that didn't work for me
[22:17:05] <coldhead> but i suck dog's balls
[22:19:49] <coldhead> dog's balls
[22:19:54] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:20:23] <goddard> coldhead: cool
[22:20:50] <goddard> coldhead: i did something similar just assigned an id to the tab link
[22:20:58] <goddard> coldhead: thanks for the help
[22:21:34] <coldhead> happy hacking, goddard
[22:28:36] <angelazou> hi, I have a script here
[22:28:37] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/4NtMg/
[22:29:19] <angelazou> actually, it's this one http://jsfiddle.net/4NtMg/1/
[22:29:27] <angelazou> that works really well in jsfiddle
[22:29:36] <angelazou> but it doesn't work at all in safari
[22:29:50] <angelazou> and I'm a little worried because this is not the first time this has happened
[22:30:57] <angelazou> is anyone else having this problem?
[22:31:09] <Cork> angelazou: you haven't said what problem your having
[22:31:20] <Cork> only a generic doesn't work
[22:31:27] <angelazou> well, the script is working fine in jsfiddle
[22:31:38] <angelazou> the button are applied different classes
[22:31:57] <angelazou> and the body text are applied different classes as different buttons are clicked on
[22:32:10] <angelazou> but when I put them in safari
[22:32:11] <Cork> i see what it does
[22:32:19] <Cork> but whats the problem your having?
[22:32:24] <angelazou> none of the events happen
[22:32:38] <Cork> in safari only?
[22:32:41] <angelazou> the identical script don't work as they did in jsfiddle
[22:33:01] <Cork> you prob run your selectors before you've added the elements to the page
[22:33:32] <angelazou> so i should run the script from the bottom of the page?
[22:33:45] <angelazou> but it's a local script
[22:33:51] <Cork> that depends on when your adding the content
[22:33:56] <angelazou> i mean nothing loads faster than a local script
[22:34:15] <Cork> if you wrap your script in ready, where on the page you have the script doesn't really matter
[22:34:40] <angelazou> the script is in a separate file
[22:34:47] <Cork> but if you have scripts that add the content to the page, just waiting for ready won't be enough
[22:34:54] <angelazou> that's attached using the script tag
[22:34:59] <Cork> uh...
[22:35:08] <angelazou> and it has document.ready
[22:35:19] <angelazou> and the script is behind the jquery.js
[22:35:33] <angelazou> and like i said, this is not the first time this has happened
[22:35:52] <angelazou> plus it's not working in safari, firefox, and chrome
[22:35:56] <angelazou> so it's a script problem
[22:36:42] <Cork> angelazou: read my answer
[22:37:36] <angelazou> what do you mean by waiting for ready won't be enough?
[22:38:27] <Cork> angelazou: if your adding the content through script (like i said)
[22:38:40] <Cork> the elements are added after ready is triggered, and your selectors won't work
[22:39:01] <angelazou> but that's how the book lays it out for me
[22:39:19] <angelazou> and I'm not adding content, only classes
[22:39:26] <Cork> angelazou: if your content is statically added to the page yes
[22:39:39] <angelazou> I only have an html file
[22:39:41] <Cork> that is every element is in the html file your loading
[22:39:54] <Cork> and nothing is modified through is yes that should work
[22:40:18] <Cork> if you've done that, i need a link to your page where you have the problem
[22:40:43] <angelazou> hmm, do you mind zip files?
[22:40:56] <Cork> yes
[22:41:18] <Cork> i need to see the page as it has the problem
[22:41:36] <Cork> a copy might not work as you just said, you couldn't reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[22:42:59] <angelazou> Cork: here you go http://www.4shared.com/zip/GCP82xpH/03_online.html?
[22:43:08] <Cork> sigh...
[22:43:32] <Cork> angelazou: if you can reproduce the problem in jsfiddle, try doing so
[22:43:37] <Cork> else i need a live link
[22:43:59] <angelazou> well...it's just 4 files
[22:44:17] <angelazou> less than 200KB i think, it's jquery.js that's taking the most space
[22:47:00] <mdhopkins> I have this current-menu-setting code for a single-page site. I want to make it generic but can only see how with a literal containing the page's menu information and eval(), which is madness. any suggestions for how to make this set of conditionals generic without pseudo-macros? http://jsfiddle.net/pTmBA/
[22:47:39] <mdhopkins> to clarify i'm expanding the single-page design to multiple pages, each with its own set of menu items.
[22:48:02] <Cork> mdhopkins: what part is it you want to make generic?
[22:48:58] <mdhopkins> Cork: what I want is to avoid reduplicating the if then array for each page. I want to generate the if-elseif-else behavior for each page depending on the hash (heights, #hash to set, etc.)
[22:49:26] <mdhopkins> Perhaps eval isn't madness but it certainly goes against what i've been taught...
[22:49:32] <Cork> mdhopkins: so have a configuration object
[22:49:57] <Cork> hmm on second though you want an array
[22:50:56] <coldhead> and i want a kitten
[22:51:00] <Cork> [{ scroll: 2150, id: 'nav_5', hash: 'contact'}, { scroll: 1300, id: 'nav_3', hash: 'portfolio'}]
[22:51:05] <Cork> mdhopkins: ^
[22:51:30] <mdhopkins> Well, I've got that actually. I'm not sure what the smart way is to implement the generic structure for that data.
[22:51:45] <mdhopkins> I mean the generic implementation that uses that data.
[22:51:52] <Cork> then just loop over the array until scroll > h[i].scroll and scroll < h[i+1].scroll
[22:52:27] <angelazou> Cork: I still can't reproduce the problem in jsfiddle see this http://jsfiddle.net/4NtMg/2/
[22:53:03] <mdhopkins> Cork: ah, of course.
[22:54:20] <Cork> mdhopkins: alternatively i would build the menu without depending on id's
[22:54:26] <Cork> that would simplify the code
[22:54:47] <Cork> give the menu options a class
[22:54:48] <angelazou> although, after I upload it to the file server, the problem begin to show
[22:54:50] <angelazou> http://93hosting.com/jq/index.html
[22:55:12] <Cork> mdhopkins: and map the index of the menu element with the position in the array
[22:56:23] <Cork> angelazou: your loading jquery too late
[22:56:27] <Cork> it needs to be in the head
[22:56:46] <mdhopkins> Cork: seems like a sensible plan.
[22:57:06] <coldhead> you're*
[22:57:30] <angelazou> Cork: just modified it, but that doesn't change anything
[22:58:01] <Cork> oh wait
[22:58:06] <Cork> i'm not reading >_<'
[22:58:12] <Cork> your using .on in ff 1.6.2
[22:58:32] <Cork> uh...
[22:58:38] <Cork> jquery 1.6.2
[22:58:44] <Cork> it was added in 1.7
[22:59:07] <Cork> you need to use bind or the $().click event listner
[22:59:53] <angelazou> oh
[23:00:07] <Cork> or update your jquery lib
[23:01:08] <angelazou> aha
[23:01:11] <angelazou> got it, thank you
[23:02:38] <angelazou> ah wait...I'm using the google jquery 1.8 in the script
[23:02:53] <angelazou> interestingly enough, as soon as i do that, the web server one works
[23:03:00] <angelazou> but the local script still doesn't
[23:03:20] <angelazou> guess it's bandwidth problem...
[23:45:29] <angelazou> I have this script http://jsfiddle.net/w6qf8/2/
[23:45:47] <angelazou> in the first step I used a simple approach assuming that all are using px
[23:46:13] <angelazou> and in the second approach I'm taking in consideration of the different unit, however, the bigger button won't work
[23:54:39] <angelazou> anyone?
