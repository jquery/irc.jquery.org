[00:22:55] <Cork> MagePsycho: move your js out of your html
[00:23:42] <MagePsycho> Cork: whats the possible solution
[00:24:05] <Cork> MagePsycho: to start with, move your js out of event attributes
[00:24:10] <Cork> and use event listeners instead
[00:24:28] <Cork> it will make things a lot easier to get working
[00:24:43] <MagePsycho> Cork: which event should be listened in this case
[00:24:54] <Cork> submit on the form
[01:08:12] <pcfreak30> Why is jq mobile auto-adding ui-btn-left when data-role="none" is present?
[01:24:06] <ocx> can i make gestures and finger swipe work over an iframe?
[01:25:24] <Cork> ocx: you would prob have to put an overlay over the iframe for that to work
[01:25:39] <ocx> Cork: how can i do that?
[01:26:10] <Cork> ocx: wrap the iframe in a div make it position relateive
[01:26:19] <Cork> and put another div in it and make it go over the iframe
[01:26:55] <ocx> and the div needs to be relative too?
[01:27:04] <Cork> when an event start you need to change the z-index of the cover div so it goes above the iframe
[01:27:10] <Cork> position: absolute
[01:27:18] <Cork> that is why you have the wrapper div
[01:27:30] <ocx> Cork: on event stat i am reloading a new page href
[01:28:14] <CrowX-> Cork, do you know some good book about jquery that isn't like 800 pages long?
[01:28:23] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[01:28:34] <Cork> CrowX-: i don't buy books about programming
[01:28:56] <ocx> Cork: http://pastie.org/8969603
[01:28:56] <CrowX-> currently I'm only learning by googling individual problems I face. Is there a better way, to get a solid foundation, like the one you have?
[01:29:03] <ocx> it doest work on body where iframe is included
[01:29:10] <ocx> it works on the whole body but not on ifrmae
[01:29:26] <CrowX-> Cork, how did you learn?
[01:29:47] <Cork> CrowX-: i learned js from about when it was created
[01:30:01] <Cork> CrowX-: and then just put jquery ontop of it
[01:30:19] <CrowX-> so you like read all the functions jquery contains? :p
[01:30:20] <Cork> CrowX-: by way of learning is to learn to get things going
[01:30:37] <Cork> and then bit by bit dig into the inner parts of the framework/language
[01:30:47] <Cork> so basically learning by solving
[01:30:49] <CrowX-> that's what I'm doing now, and I still end up bothering you with questions every now and then
[01:31:26] <Cork> CrowX-: a good start is to start breaking down the problem
[01:31:37] <Cork> when something doesn't work
[01:31:50] <Cork> start a small testcase and pinpoint exactly what breaks it
[01:32:15] <Cork> that normally is enough for you to be able to get a hint of what is the exact problem, and solution
[01:32:23] <Cork> the rest is basically just experience
[01:32:30] <CrowX-> ok
[01:32:32] <CrowX-> thanks
[01:32:34] <Cork> np
[01:33:06] <Cork> CrowX-: that is actually why i nag about reduced testcases in jsfiddle and jsbin
[01:33:25] <Cork> CrowX-: cause when i was fairly new at jquery i found that was where i solved my problem
[01:33:44] <Cork> generating the problem again to ask the question, often made me not have to ask the question
[01:33:45] <ocx> Cork: have you dealt with the hammer.js?
[01:34:05] <Cork> cause i found the problem and by that the solution by formulating the example and question
[01:34:25] <Cork> ocx: can't say i've even heard of it
[01:34:37] <Cork> ah
[01:34:38] <Cork> touch
[01:34:43] <ocx> ok thats the buddy giving gestures and swipes dectection
[01:34:47] <CrowX-> I see
[01:35:09] <ocx> Cork: the code  http://pastie.org/8969603 works on the wholebody but not on the iframe included in body
[01:36:00] <Cork> ocx: ya, cause iframes are a separate document
[01:36:09] <Cork> ocx: so events don't go from the iframe into the parent page
[01:36:24] <Cork> ocx: that is why i talked about the cover div
[01:36:32] <Cork> if you put an element ontop of the iframe
[01:36:36] <ocx> so it would go <div><iframe></div> ?
[01:36:51] <Cork> <div><iframe></iframe><div></div></div>
[01:37:06] <Cork> <div class="wrapper"><iframe></iframe><div class="cover"></div></div>
[01:37:18] <Cork> ocx: but not that also means you can't get events into the iframe
[01:37:22] <Cork> *note
[01:38:00] <ocx> i just want to give the user the abilitiy to swipe left or right on any part of the screen including when doing so over the iframe Cork
[01:38:16] <Cork> ocx: ya, but it isn't that simple
[01:38:20] <Cork> for the reason i gave you
[01:38:31] <ocx> your method wouldnt work?
[01:38:51] <Cork> my method would work but it might be hard to hook it into hammer
[01:39:27] <Cork> ocx: but the base of the problem is that touch and mouse events goes into the document you do it over
[01:39:36] <Cork> it doesn't propagate cross documents
[01:40:10] <ocx> like create a layer for touch events which is transparent
[01:40:11] <ocx> dunno
[01:40:18] <Cork> yes
[01:40:35] <Cork> that is what i meant with the example i gave
[01:41:37] <ocx> the whole other code is included in <div class="cover"></div> ?
[01:42:03] <Cork> no
[01:45:08] <ocx> Cork: http://pastie.org/8969655
[01:45:10] <ocx> doest work
[01:46:28] <dwarder> does jquery sends callback upon post request?
[01:48:06] <Cork> dwarder: send callbacks?
[01:50:47] <dwarder> Cork: as it does with get
[01:50:47] <Cork> ocx: http://jsfiddle.net/bcqhL/1/
[01:51:04] <dwarder> Cork: random callback
[01:51:08] <Cork> dwarder: are you talking about if the callbacks fire when you get a response from the server?
[01:52:07] <ocx> Cork: what idoes that mean?
[01:52:10] <dwarder> Cork: upon get request jquery adds randomb value callback so that server could respond with values that are wrapped inside this random callback
[01:52:10] <Cork> ocx: http://jsfiddle.net/bcqhL/2/
[01:52:12] <ocx> it doesnt work?
[01:52:17] <Cork> actually the background color change isn't needed
[01:52:24] <Cork> ocx: press a mousebutton
[01:52:36] <Cork> wait for a little bit and move over the iframe
[01:53:12] <dwarder> Cork: jsonp it is called?
[01:53:23] <Cork> ah
[01:53:31] <Cork> dwarder: you can only make get calls with jsonp
[01:53:44] <ocx> Cork: the mouse button needs to be pressed outside theiframe
[01:53:45] <Cork> dwarder: jsonp creates <script> tags and add them to the head
[01:53:56] <ocx> what if the user swipes from the iframe
[01:54:00] <Cork> dwarder: and loads js from a server and the js calls a function with the json
[01:54:16] <Cork> ocx: only way to handle that would be to have js in the iframe
[01:54:22] <dwarder> Cork: got it thank you
[01:54:24] <ocx> cant i position an overlay on top of the iframe with visibility: hidden
[01:54:39] <Cork> ocx: unless your ok with completely blocking mouse/touch events from ever getting to the iframe
[01:54:55] <Cork> ocx: the problem isn't visibility
[01:55:05] <Cork> it is if you want to be able to interact with the content in the iframe
[01:55:31] <Cork> ocx: http://jsfiddle.net/bcqhL/3/
[01:55:37] <Cork> try scrolling the second iframe
[01:55:48] <Cork> (by mouseweel)
[01:56:09] <Cork> the cover is remove on mouseup so clicking will kill my example
[01:56:28] <Cork> a better example of the problem http://jsfiddle.net/bcqhL/4
[01:57:44] <ocx> Cork: can i overwrite the left and right on the iframe and keep the scroll up and down working?
[01:57:59] <Cork> left and right?
[01:58:13] <Cork> ocx: what i did was add a cover over the iframe
[01:58:20] <Cork> no events what so ever gets to the iframe
[01:58:31] <ocx> but now i cannot navigate the iframe right
[01:58:32] <Cork> as you can't focus it, or click on it
[01:58:36] <Cork> exactly
[01:58:57] <Cork> that is why you need to do the cover thing based of when you think it's going to happen
[01:59:00] <ocx> the iframe is actually browsable heh
[01:59:04] <Cork> so the normal functionality can work
[01:59:22] <Cork> ocx: should be impossible in /4
[01:59:45] <ocx> so we conclude that if the iframe needs to be scrollable browsable it will such up all events over it
[02:00:15] <Cork> ocx: no iframes will always suck up all mouse and touch events
[02:00:22] <ocx> otherwise a malicious user would be able to control the clicks
[02:00:28] <Cork> exactly
[02:00:32] <ocx> inside the iframe to redirect the user to some other site maybe
[02:00:48] <Cork> and what we did with the cover is actually called click jacking
[02:00:49] <ocx> good talk thanks Cork  :)
[02:00:53] <Cork> *clickjacking
[02:01:03] <ocx> yea it can trick the user too specially on ads maybe
[02:01:10] <Cork> but it is the only way to do it if you want to get the events
[02:01:20] <Cork> as it actually happens on a different page
[02:01:21] <ocx> where they would say press the button and you get redirected to some other stuff
[02:01:59] <Cork> ya, that is what clickjacking concepts aim to do
[02:02:59] <ocx> Cork: btw why is jscript so risky to execute what kind of nasty stuff can it do inside a browser?
[02:03:12] <Cork> js or javascript
[02:03:17] <ocx> javascript
[02:03:24] <Cork> jscript is microsofts thing
[02:03:28] <ocx> yes
[02:03:41] <Cork> ocx: cause random site can run it without the user having to do anything
[02:03:50] <Cork> and it runs on there computer with there sessions
[02:04:02] <Cork> so it can do things as that user on pages
[02:04:06] <ocx> yes but i mean it cannot harm the user
[02:04:12] <Cork> js isn't really risky as long as it is limited to your page
[02:04:16] <Cork> ocx: it can
[02:04:28] <Cork> if they can for ex access the content of an iframe
[02:04:35] <ocx> it can make the user do some behaviors on sites, but i mean it cannot harm his computer
[02:04:43] <Cork> they would just use a hidden iframe, load the users facebook account
[02:04:50] <Cork> and change there password, or plainly grab it
[02:04:58] <Cork> or there address, phone number or...
[02:05:16] <Cork> ocx: well not the computer, but the users account on other pages
[02:05:36] <ocx> can you illustrate that? curious to know how it would happen :)
[02:05:38] <Cork> ocx: most of the xss problems is about leaking info from one site to another
[02:05:39] <ocx> if you have time..
[02:05:55] <Cork> you can't do it anymore cause browsers block it
[02:06:26] <Cork> but <iframe style="display: none" src="http://other-site.com/useraccount></iframe>
[02:06:46] <Cork> and on load of the iframe you go into the document and grab the data you want
[02:07:03] <Cork> as the iframe will be loaded by the users browser
[02:07:10] <Cork> it will send the users session cookie
[02:07:20] <Cork> so the page loaded there will have the users account
[02:07:36] <Cork> another check is to check if the page is a specific height
[02:07:42] <Cork> if the page change height if your logged in
[02:07:54] <Cork> that way the site could sniff if you have an account there
[02:07:57] <Cork> and so on
[02:08:13] <Cork> other solutions was to use the visited styling of links
[02:08:22] <ocx> so mainly a small javascript that would go and read the content returned from the iframe and maybe email it to the malicious user
[02:08:29] <Cork> and check if a link had that color to see if they visited the url you had
[02:08:41] <Cork> ocx: and click buttons and what not
[02:09:46] <ocx> interesting
[02:10:09] <Cork> ocx: this is just a few historical xss problems
[02:10:13] <Cork> there is loads more
[02:10:13] <ocx> now browsers dont allow hidden iframes to be loaded?
[02:10:19] <Cork> they do
[02:10:25] <zth> is the classic "collapse" function a native part of jquery?
[02:10:28] <Cork> but if the loaded content is from a different domain
[02:10:31] <Cork> you can't access the content
[02:10:38] <Cork> not even the height or scrollbar position
[02:10:47] <Cork> the iframe is a black box
[02:11:02] <ocx> so how can i see it if i cant access it
[02:11:26] <ocx> it is retrieved somewhere in the browser in a section where a user does not have access to?
[02:11:28] <DRSK> Cork Â» http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/7/show/ <-- how do I make sure I can't bug the animation out by pressing the buttons before the animation has finished? I need to somehow make it foolproof. Do you have any ideas what I can do? Also I am unable to center the damn box in its container, something with line 16.
[02:11:50] <Cork> ocx: it throws an exception if you try
[02:13:12] <Cork> DRSK: not a hole lot of options there
[02:13:27] <Cork> DRSK: i usually do it by letting css do the animations how days
[02:13:35] <Cork> as it handles those things automatically
[02:13:39] <DRSK> Cork Â» ouch, really? well, anything really.
[02:13:42] <DRSK> Wait, you mean CSS3?
[02:13:45] <Cork> yes
[02:13:49] <DRSK> Well this little section is for IE8 users ;/
[02:13:59] <Cork> then you can use .stop()
[02:14:00] <DRSK> hence the transitionSupport is forced to false;
[02:14:12] <Cork> or block clicks on the button until the animation ends
[02:14:13] <DRSK> I am trying, it's on line 16 but they're ignored somehow in my logic
[02:14:16] <Cork> not really much else you can do
[02:14:49] <DRSK> How could I perhaps .off() the button click thing until the animation is done?
[02:15:07] <DRSK> Do I do something like bla.off(); inside the fn.contentSlide on in/out respectively?
[02:15:11] <Cork> set a value on .data() for the element
[02:15:22] <Cork> and at the beginning of the event handler check the value
[02:15:30] <Cork> when animation ends you remove the value
[02:15:48] <Cork> well true/false is prob the simplest solution
[02:15:59] <Cork> though that usually give a bad user experience
[02:16:12] <Cork> as the ui freezes for animations to complete
[02:16:19] <DRSK> that sounds viable enough, I will try. Although I'm not all that familiar with data except for fetching data-attrs
[02:16:20] <Cork> and makes it feel sluggish
[02:16:41] <DRSK> I just want to make sure the boxes don't stack and bug out if you switch between them too fast
[02:16:59] <DRSK> which, right now, they do. And that means the entire page breaks and I can't have that :(
[02:17:02] <Cork> DRSK: if($(this).data('block') { return; } $(this).data('block',true);
[02:17:09] <Cork> and after the animation $(this).data('block',false);
[02:17:31] <Cork> DRSK: the problem there is that animate queues per element
[02:17:45] <Cork> DRSK: and as you animate each element on it's own you get the problem you see
[02:17:58] <Cork> DRSK: you could try setting stop to jump to the end of the animation
[02:18:07] <Cork> but remember you need to do it on the old element
[02:18:09] <Cork> not the new one
[02:18:19] <DRSK> ohhh good point
[02:19:42] <dawkirst> Trying to wrap my head around callbacks and events. Is http://jsfiddle.net/emilesilvis/rp6r8/1/ functionally equivalent to http://jsfiddle.net/emilesilvis/Z52BS/2/ (albeit different patterns)?
[02:20:01] <DRSK> Cork Â» as for the .data part, the first one where it returns if it's true; so let me get it right. When I start the animation of moving a box in, I first check for "block". If that's true, return (which would abort?). If it's not true, set it to true. Now AFTER the animation is finished, perhaps in the callback of animate? I specifically set it to false?
[02:20:55] <Cork> dawkirst: yes they are basically the same thing
[02:21:09] <Cork> dawkirst: only difference is one does it with callbacks, and one with fake events
[02:21:58] <Cork> DRSK: exactly
[02:22:58] <Cork> DRSK: i would try avoiding it for animations though
[02:23:15] <Cork> but for ex ajax i use is sometimes to prevent duplicate calls
[02:23:48] <DRSK> hmph, I understand your concern. But other than .data the only thing I can do is try to get hold of the previous 'target' and .stop() that, else I'm shite out of luck? ^^
[02:24:12] <dawkirst> Cork, thanks. So, from a best practice point of view, which one is preferred, and why?
[02:24:26] <Cork> DRSK: ya, that is prob the bets option (the old element that is)
[02:24:50] <DRSK> Cork Â» that being said, taking a look within the extended function surrounding line 16, how could I somehow fetch it's predecessor so to speak? :p
[02:24:53] <Cork> dawkirst: i usually use fake events as little as possible
[02:25:11] <Cork> dawkirst: but if an unknown script needs to be notified about the action
[02:25:12] <DRSK> Cork Â» meaning, the 'previous' element isn't available and I'm wondering how I could make it so?
[02:25:19] <Cork> events is often nice there
[02:25:32] <dawkirst> Cork, what are "fake events"? As in custom events?
[02:25:33] <DRSK> Cork Â» perhaps I add another argument to the function where I can pass along the previous element? or hm
[02:25:41] <Cork> dawkirst: but if it is limited to responses for an action callbacks is faster and much less overhead
[02:25:53] <Cork> dawkirst: .trigger()
[02:26:04] <Cork> it makes jquery go an event emulation route
[02:27:07] <dawkirst> Cork, ok, makes sense. Thanks.
[02:28:21] <ocx> cork how can i load a new page like an href when a user swipes
[02:28:21] <Cork> DRSK: i don't really see how you pick the new element
[02:28:46] <Cork> ocx: window.location = href
[02:28:48] <ocx> something like .on("swipeleft", function(ev) { <load new page>});
[02:28:51] <ocx> ok
[02:29:02] <DRSK> Cork Â» the links have data-link="" and that's being used at line 37 to determine the target
[02:29:07] <Cork> jqm might have a helper function to do it with ajax when possible if you use jqm that is
[02:29:29] <Cork> DRSK: sure, i follow that part
[02:29:34] <Cork> but what moves to the next element?
[02:29:36] <DRSK> Cork Â» later on at line 53 is basically where I'm calling the function to do the animation if
[02:29:46] <Cork> or this isn't a a slideshow?
[02:30:14] <DRSK> it's not really a slideshow, no. It's just an attempt of having a specific way of animating the different content boxes there are
[02:30:33] <DRSK> the boxes will look like "busses" eventually, and so they come from the left and leave to the right..
[02:30:46] <Cork> ah
[02:30:53] <DRSK> if that makes any sense at all ;p
[02:31:32] <Cork> DRSK: you might be able to do something like contentBoxes.filter(':animated') ?
[02:31:38] <DRSK> so basically I have the "current" (before animating anything) set to active I believe
[02:31:45] <DRSK> animated? oh that sounds useful
[02:31:53] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[02:32:14] <Cork> so before you do the in call you do contentBoxes.filter(':animated').stop()
[02:32:40] <Cork> or even contentBoxes.filter(':animated').stop(true, true)
[02:33:35] <DRSK> Cork Â» so between line 53 and 54 and 56/57?
[02:33:57] <Cork> ya
[02:34:08] <DRSK> hmph yeah somehow that didn't fire, hang on I'll update
[02:34:13] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/8/
[02:34:51] <DRSK> Cork Â» after "switching" a couple of times, both are visible one being underneath the other
[02:35:33] <Cork> hmm
[02:35:47] <janq> Have you guys any tips for plugins that would allow the user to hightlight or bold the text
[02:36:05] <janq> while preserving \n etc
[02:36:13] <Cork> janq: it is that thing called css ;)
[02:36:25] <janq> :3
[02:36:38] <Cork> DRSK: sorry can't really help you it is a little more complex then i have time to dig into
[02:36:52] <DRSK> Cork Â» all right I understand thanks for helping me!
[02:37:08] <janq> Well thats what i did at 1st
[02:37:10] <Cork> janq: to bold text you need elements
[02:37:25] <janq> so no bolding in pure pre?
[02:37:32] <Cork> no
[02:37:46] <janq> not a good day :D
[02:49:53] <Grundell> Hello
[02:51:29] <xec> Hello Grundell! Welcome to #jQuery !
[02:51:57] <slax0r> No
[02:51:58] <Grundell> I have a bit of a problem atm. I have a fixed menu and from the menu there is a button that is called "FÃ¥ offert", Here is a dropdown form the problem is that this dropdown form is to high in mobile landscape view, so i woundered if there is a posibility to maybe adds some type of jQuery to make that element scroll before the page scrolls
[02:52:07] <Grundell> The page is www.dresssupinyou.se
[02:52:17] <Grundell> sorry
[02:52:27] <slax0r> sorry for? :)
[02:52:27] <Grundell> www.dressupinyou.se
[02:52:32] <Grundell> Wrong adress :)
[02:53:08] <Grundell> slax0r noted that i had three s's instead of 2 :)
[02:53:49] <xec> Grundell: I don't see "FÃ¥ offert" anywhere, where am I supposed to look?
[02:54:07] <xec> oh it's a title not a menu item
[02:54:19] <xec> you mean the "FÃ¥ offert direkt!" ?
[02:54:33] <Grundell> xec  - its the green button right under the menu when you're in landskape
[02:54:44] <xec> oh, "FÃ¥ information" ?
[02:55:13] <seutje> I can't help but read "Ã¥" like a divine shout
[02:55:27] <Cork> heh
[02:55:27] <xec> I believe it is.
[02:55:30] <Grundell> Yes but you have to be in mobile view in order to see it in the menu
[02:55:38] <xec> Pronounced "AWW"
[02:55:49] <Grundell> seutje:  hahaha :D
[02:55:50] <xec> define "mobile view"?
[02:56:41] <Grundell> 568x380 px landscape iphone
[02:56:49] <xec> i can actually see a "FÃ¥ offert" button with a narrow browser window, but it doesn't appear to do anything. layout is a mess though
[02:57:02] <Cork> seutje: "i enda u a véya é a å å i åa ä a ö"
[02:57:16] <Cork> i love the old slang phrase :)
[02:57:39] <Grundell> you need to reload the page since everything is built depending on scenarios
[02:57:48] <xec> google translate gives "the only thing u a Veya Ã© a Ã¥ Ã¥ AA A a island" for that
[02:58:08] <seronis> need help with a selector syntax.. i know this is wrong  $(infoCopy+ ' > tbody > tr'),    infoCopy itself is the return of a clone(true)..  but what do i write to get the selector im attempting there ?
[02:58:12] <seutje> Cork: I read that to the tone of "old McDonald had a farm"
[02:58:15] <Grundell> so reload the page when browser window is 568 x 320 px and you'll see that it is a dropdown..
[02:58:34] <xec> lol. okay
[02:58:54] <seutje> the "Ã© Ã¥ i Ã¤ Ã¶" did me in, probably
[02:58:55] <Cork> xec: "at the end of the road is a river and in the river is an island"
[02:59:24] <anli_> What does the function .on do when there are three args?
[02:59:26] <xec> damn swedes
[02:59:28] <Cork> å == river ö = island
[02:59:37] <anli_> element.on("click", ".foobar", function(){});
[02:59:39] <Cork> é = är == is
[02:59:40] <Grundell> Cork - Learning swedish ?
[02:59:48] <Cork> Grundell: lol nope
[02:59:49] <anli_> :)
[02:59:55] <xec> cork IS a damn swede
[02:59:57] <anli_> Allt é bra
[02:59:59] <Cork> Grundell: just local slang
[03:00:02] <anli_> "All is well"
[03:00:10] <seutje> xec: sweet*
[03:00:15] <xec> s/damn/sweet
[03:00:15] <seronis> anli,  when the 'click' event is generated on something with class 'foobar' assigned it calls the supplied function
[03:00:16] <Grundell> Cork: you are :D thats awesome, me too
[03:00:20] <seronis> since your function has no body, it does nothing
[03:00:31] <seutje> I always call it sweetland
[03:00:32] <anli_> seronis: Does it filter on target then?
[03:00:52] <xec> seutje: the sweetish people of sweeten
[03:01:02] <Grundell> anyhow is there a smart way to fix this scroll problem ?
[03:01:43] <seronis> anli_,  https://api.jquery.com/on/  probably explains it better than me.  im new.
[03:01:50] <xec> Grundell: i dont really understand the problem to be honest. what do you mean by "make that element scroll before the page scrolls"
[03:02:03] <seronis> but yes its filtering your selectors descendants based on the target  '.foobar'
[03:03:31] <Cork> Grundell, seutje, xec: http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Dumt_f%C3%B4lk
[03:04:08] <seutje> I need somebody to send me a recording of them saying this
[03:04:14] <Grundell> xec- okay since the window height is 320px - the fixed menu is 45px and the dropdown form is 320px the problem is that in mobile landscape you cant se the whole form, though since the form is positioned to fixed i need to do something that makes it possible for me to scroll down the from in order to see the whole form in mobile landscape view
[03:04:22] <seutje> hearing sweetish brabble just cheers me up
[03:05:07] <Grundell> Cork: you have to much time on your hands :D
[03:05:10] <xec> seutje: i think there is a youtube clip of someone reciting that, hold on
[03:05:36] <xec> seutje: found it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UmUX68KtE
[03:05:37] <Cork> seutje: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP_mwiOY7C8
[03:06:14] <xec> i was first ;)
[03:06:23] <Cork> hmm no that is not the correct one...
[03:06:29] <Cork> (mine i meant)
[03:06:46] <Grundell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeL1Uo-gX34
[03:07:48] <seutje> xec: is this legit?
[03:07:50] <seutje> :')
[03:08:37] <xec> seutje: i'm pretty sure, just keep the text handy so you can see what he's saying
[03:08:44] <Grundell> Cork , seutje, xec - here it is !!
[03:08:45] <Grundell> http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Dumt_fÃ´lk
[03:08:56] <Cork> Grundell: i already linked the text
[03:08:58] <xec> lol
[03:08:59] <Grundell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRpybTw1XLM
[03:09:01] <Grundell> Sorry
[03:09:05] <Grundell> Wrong one :)
[03:09:06] <seutje> no sorry, only happy
[03:10:17] <Cork> the recording is quite bad though
[03:10:21] <seronis> anli_,  hopefully that link was helpful.  i had it handy cause i just used it 5 minutes before you asked
[03:10:30] <Grundell> Cork - well not that bad :P
[03:10:33] <anli_> :)
[03:10:41] <Grundell> Can hear pretty well what they are saying
[03:10:47] <Cork> Grundell: the slang is not correct
[03:11:11] <Cork> Grundell: sounds like a stocholmer trying to imitate it
[03:11:17] <Grundell> No well it's written in 1892 so can't really apply the swedish rules
[03:11:31] <anli_> seutje: I will translate the call to .on to .kendoTouch, seems like I have to do the selection in the event handler myself
[03:12:03] <seutje> oro? I've never used kendo o.O
[03:14:09] <Cork> Grundell: my dad has an old cassette with real dialect
[03:14:14] <Cork> it makes all the difference
[03:17:06] <seronis> is there a selector syntax you can use to grab staggered sets of child elements?  like grab every even child.  every odd child.  or to grab 3, skip 3, grab 3, skip 3 etc
[03:17:30] <seutje> staggered? you mean like nth-child or nth-of-type?
[03:17:55] <seronis> and in sets.  its for manipulating table rows that are grouped in order to do staggered colors
[03:18:01] <seronis> like white row, black row, white row, etc
[03:18:22] <seronis> and some of the tables im editing have the rows in sets.. so its 3 white, 3 black, 3 white, etc
[03:18:50] <seutje> jQuery does all CSS3 selectors, you can just use thos
[03:18:52] <seutje> those*
[03:19:24] <seronis> is there a selector syntax to do what i said though?
[03:19:35] <Cork> seronis: seutje just answered you...
[03:19:59] <seronis> all i've found is for grabbing a specific child.  or first/last
[03:20:00] <Cork> $('tr:nth-child(odd)')
[03:20:21] <Cork> ?mdn nth-child
[03:20:21] <b-ot> Cork: :nth-child - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child
[03:21:12] <Cork> seronis: also just do it with css, not need to color rows in js
[03:22:00] <xec> +1 for css
[03:22:11] <seronis> id be grabbing the sets in order to just apply a class label
[03:22:31] <xec> why
[03:22:33] <seronis> but that page still doesnt seem to do grabs in sets
[03:22:36] <Cork> seronis: or just add the style for the table from css
[03:22:51] <seronis> im editing pages with greasemonkey
[03:22:59] <Cork> ah
[03:23:00] <seronis> i cant edit the originals
[03:23:06] <Cork> add a <style> tag?
[03:23:25] <seronis> yeah.. im just looking for a smiple selector to replace the ugly looping i have to do now
[03:23:43] <seronis> ie.. sometables are in groups of 4.. so i need to graqb 4 rows, skip 4, grab 4, skip 4
[03:24:12] <seronis> the nth child doesnt seem to do that
[03:24:36] <Grundell> Sorry guys got a phonecall
[03:25:04] <Grundell> Any how, im looking for a soulution on my form... is there a smart way to solve this ?
[03:26:30] <Cork> seronis: if you want a range slice might be what you want
[03:26:37] <xec> seronis: http://jsfiddle.net/xj6W2/2/ no javascript
[03:26:53] <xec> seronis: if you are just trying to style them
[03:27:33] <seronis> xec,  im also doing insertions, deletions, other things.  its why im curious if there is a selector syntax to do even/odd but in N sized groups
[03:27:47] <seronis> the loops to do it manually are ugly =-)
[03:28:06] <xec> well you can use the same selector i did in css with jquery
[03:29:20] <xec> seronis: http://jsfiddle.net/xj6W2/3/
[03:29:26] <seutje> seronis: http://jsfiddle.net/a7A3k/
[03:29:36] <seutje> lol
[03:30:10] <seronis> ok thanks guys.  between the 2 of those it makes sense
[03:31:30] <Tekla> how do i know what's in "$(this)"?
[03:32:00] <seutje> look at the context or just console.log() it
[03:32:13] <Cork> Tekla: do what in this?
[03:32:34] <Tekla> i mean if i add a .click() thingy and call a function from there is there going to be the original calling scope?
[03:33:00] <Cork> Tekla: depends on how you structure your code
[03:33:07] <xec> in a click handler, 'this' will be whatever you bound to
[03:33:32] <Cork> xec: i think he meant it calls a function from the handler
[03:33:34] <Tekla> yes.. that's what i want to be transferred :)
[03:33:45] <Cork> Tekla: func.call(this)
[03:33:49] <seutje> `mdn function.call
[03:33:49] <b-ot> seutje: Function.prototype.call() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[03:34:01] <seutje> still too slow q.q
[03:34:08] <xec> :D
[03:34:10] <Tekla> $('body').click(function() { if (isPrintable()) do whatever}); <-- in isPrintable
[03:34:24] <seutje> isPrintable.call(this)
[03:34:25] <Cork> isPrintable.call(this)
[03:34:29] <Tekla> thanks
[03:34:36] <seutje> HAH!
[03:34:41] <xec> lol
[03:34:42] * seutje does a victory dance
[03:34:44] <Cork> or if you prefer isPrintable(this) function isPrintable(target) {}
[03:36:28] <rethus> I have add this to my html document:http://privatepaste.com/cbe435440a
[03:36:42] <rethus> but if i have a look at the page, if loaded :
[03:37:10] <rethus> document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] there is no jquery loaded with it
[03:37:44] <Cork> rethus: the first one triggers async loading
[03:37:50] <rethus> but if i evecute the code inside of the typeof jQuery.ui function, the script is added
[03:37:53] <Cork> rethus: so the second script tag will fail
[03:38:01] <rethus> Cork: how can i do this
[03:38:10] <Cork> rethus: you need to attach an onload event handler on the script tag
[03:38:20] <Cork> and fire the second code from the callback
[03:39:29] <rethus> this one: $(document).load(function(){
[03:39:50] <Cork> no
[03:40:18] <DRSK> I'm still stuck trying to prevent the boxes to bug out when pressing the buttons "too much" - it's unstable because I can't seem to make .stop() function properly seen on line 54 and 58. Anyone able to help me solve this issue? - http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/8/
[03:40:19] <Cork> rethus: the script tag you create in the first script section
[03:40:42] <Cork> rethus: also you risk causing jquery ui to fail to load for the same reason
[03:40:48] <xec> can't you just listen to the load event on the script element?
[03:40:55] <Cork> you have to
[03:41:08] <Cork> there is no other event that will indicate that the code is loaded
[03:41:09] <xec> also, the check for jquery ui is reversed
[03:41:15] <xec> != instead of ==
[03:41:34] <Cork> and you don't need typeof
[03:41:44] <Cork> window.jQuery === undefined
[03:41:51] <Cork> and window.jQuery.ui === undefined
[03:42:28] <xec> window.jQuery.ui will fail if window.jQuery doesnt exist
[03:42:33] <Cork> ya
[03:42:36] <rethus> don't see what you mean to fire with an callback. how can i do this?
[03:42:59] <Cork> rethus: in the if cases in the first script tag
[03:43:03] <DRSK> xec, seutje, I'd appreciate your inputs :)
[03:43:06] <Cork> you have a "script" variable
[03:43:07] <xec> (but so will jQuery.ui)
[03:43:13] <seutje> I'm up, I'm up!
[03:43:20] <DRSK> :P
[03:43:27] <rethus> Cork: yes
[03:43:35] <Cork> rethus: if jquery ui doesn't exist you create a script variable
[03:43:44] <Cork> you need to attach an load event to that element
[03:44:03] <Cork> and when it fires load jquery ui
[03:44:14] <Cork> and when that loads
[03:44:21] <Cork> handle the jquery code you want
[03:44:53] <xec> rethus: there are libs that help with this sort of thing though http://requirejs.org/
[03:44:53] <Cork> basically if jquery is missing load it, when that is loaded load ui or if jquery existed but didn't load ui
[03:45:12] <Cork> rethus: ready calls you have in the later script tag won't work
[03:45:21] <Cork> as jquery won't exist when that code runs
[03:45:46] <rethus> you mean this way: $(document).ready(document.createElement('script'))
[03:45:51] <Cork> no
[03:46:02] <Cork> that only works if you always have jquery loaded
[03:46:17] <Cork> rethus: but you create the jquery script tag with js
[03:46:24] <seutje> DRSK: how do you want it to act?
[03:46:26] <Cork> so you need to handle the load event from loading the script
[03:46:34] <Cork> and wait for the script to be loaded
[03:47:09] <DRSK> seutje Â» well, if you change transitionSupport to "true" up top you'll see how it switches from using animate() to CSS3 -> and that's basically the behavior I'm after.
[03:47:15] <DRSK> ok time to hide, pet0r just arrived :D'
[03:47:52] <DRSK> seutje Â» basically, if you don't change to true and leave it at false, it works if you're "gentle", meaning.. if you let it finish it works as intended. However if you spam the buttons all hell breaks loose.
[03:48:45] <DRSK> seutje Â» usually that's a .stop() being required, but as Cork put it earlier, I'm animating two different elements hence two different queues I guess. So there we have it, now the question is really how I can prevent it from bugging out!
[03:50:15] <seutje> well, ur not even animating them in the same way
[03:51:15] <DRSK> seutje Â» the animate() part is for IE8 really, and I'm trying to "mimmick" the way it works with CSS, or sort of. Which it kinda does, btu the problem is that I can bugg it and that's that :(
[03:51:38] <xec> all this work for ie8 support?
[03:51:48] <xec> can't ie8 users live without animation? :P
[03:51:51] <DRSK> Trying to avoid it bugging out really and basically just in from left, staying put, out to the right.
[03:51:57] <seutje> without a similar easing, this will never look close to the other
[03:51:59] <DRSK> xec Â» it's a special case I'm afraid.
[03:52:24] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/9/
[03:52:31] <seutje> good enough? didn't add the easing though
[03:52:34] * xec is so happy he doesn't have to care about ie8 any more
[03:52:36] <DRSK> seutje Â» ignore the actual animation easing for now, that's not the problem I'm facing. It's 2 issues; if you spam the buttons it breaks. And secondly, I can't seem to center the damn thing btu that's another story.
[03:53:04] <seutje> framerate takes a hit if u spam, but it's not that bad imo
[03:53:27] <DRSK> seutje Â» hm now one button animates in and the other out, that's not the intention :D
[03:53:35] <seutje> oh
[03:53:37] <seutje> lol
[03:54:15] <seutje> erm, that's not how it works for me though
[03:54:28] <rethus> Cork: Mhh. dont't understand that fully. But thanks to try to explain it.
[03:54:49] <xec> if open, first click animates out, next in
[03:54:53] <Cork> rethus: when you create a script element and inject it into the page
[03:54:59] <xec> i guess he wants to open whatever you click
[03:55:03] <Cork> rethus: it ends up at the end of scripts to parse and run
[03:55:09] <xec> (i.e. never just out)
[03:55:15] <Cork> rethus: so all the script that was statically in the page will run first
[03:55:23] <seutje> I can spam-click "bar" and "hehe" will never go away though
[03:55:29] <seutje> same for foo and haha
[03:55:32] <rethus> Cork: ok
[03:55:35] <Cork> rethus: so, for them to run after the script you create, you need them to wait for the load event of the new element
[03:58:12] <DRSK> seutje Â» 2 seconds gonna reload again
[03:58:42] <rethus> Cork: http://privatepaste.com/68fb53d7b9 so here is an onload.
[03:58:48] <DRSK> seutje Â» yeah no, I click "bar" and bar's content box comes from the left. Now I want to view "foo", that only takes "bar" out.
[03:58:49] <rethus> you mean this way?
[03:59:16] <Cork> rethus: uh...
[03:59:26] <seutje> oh yeah, guess I made it so you *have* to spam-click :P
[03:59:32] <Cork> rethus: that is completely opposite to what i said
[03:59:41] <DRSK> seutje Â» the idea is like xec said, clicking a button will animate the content box from left to center. Clicking "another" button will toss the previous one out to the right and take the new one in from left.
[03:59:46] <rethus> in this way tha scripts should be loaded first ?!
[04:00:09] <DRSK> seutje Â» and the issue I had was if I spammed them they'd break (displaying both, one under the other) and locking the script
[04:00:12] <Cork> rethus: no in that way you won't even create the script tag until everything else including images has been loaded
[04:00:36] <DRSK> seutje Â» do you see any way out of this misery ? :p
[04:00:38] <rethus> but how can i handle it to load them before each other
[04:00:44] <Cork> so you pushed the scripts even further back in the load queue
[04:00:51] <Cork> rethus: the onload event
[04:01:05] <seutje> DRSK: yeah, grab a cup of coffee and have a smoke :D
[04:01:09] <Cork> you need to wait for the script tag you created to load
[04:01:40] <seutje> I should really finish this goals and objectives craptolia
[04:01:45] <rethus> k, but I don't know how to do that
[04:01:53] <Cork> uh
[04:02:02] <Cork> "attach the event listener to the script tag"
[04:02:12] <Cork> what part of that isn't obvious?
[04:02:24] <DRSK> seutje Â» been pulling my hair out for the past couple of hours trying to figure this one out. I'm totally fine with the way it functions for us with a browser that works. But I really do need to provide a similar experience for those without in this case :/
[04:02:58] <DRSK> and it breaks due to excessive "clicking"
[04:06:07] <murosai> does someone know if it's possible to make content overflow the boundaries of jquery-dialog?
[04:06:34] <Cork> murosai: change the content element to be overflow: visible;
[04:07:26] <pessimism> what's a good way to debug jquery CSS that doesn't look like it's being applied?
[04:07:50] <Cork> pessimism: the browsers inspector is normally the best tool
[04:08:28] <rethus> Cork: I'm not worked a lot with eventliseners. I've found something like: document.addEventListener("DomContentLoaded",fn,false);
[04:08:39] <rethus> you mean something like this ?
[04:08:47] <Cork> rethus: your still trying to delay the wrong end
[04:08:58] <Cork> rethus: it isn't events from the document you need to wait for
[04:09:03] <Cork> it is events from the script tag
[04:09:16] <pessimism> Cork: does jQuery log the CSS anywhere?
[04:09:18] <Cork> rethus: you are using the correct event just on the wrong end
[04:09:29] <Cork> pessimism: jquery doesn't load the css
[04:09:31] <Cork> the browser does
[04:09:34] <pessimism> ah
[04:09:56] <rethus> k, one moment â€¦
[04:10:17] <rethus> script.addEventListener("DomContentLoaded",fn,false);
[04:10:30] <Cork> no
[04:10:51] <Cork> rethus: try to think about what we said instead of throwing random things out
[04:12:54] <DaniG2k> can anyone help me please. I am trying to only display these dropdown divs when the li is clicked, not have them expanded by default
[04:12:57] <DaniG2k> http://jsfiddle.net/a2geG/2/
[04:13:26] <DaniG2k> also, I noticed that when a div opens or closes, the one below jumps a bit as well
[04:13:32] <DaniG2k> is there a way I can make that smoother?
[04:13:55] <rethus> Cork: sorry have no clue. :(
[04:15:11] <Cork> rethus: like i said when you create the new script tag, attach a load event and from the load event fire the code that depends on what you loaded with the script tag
[04:27:40] <murosai> Cork: i tried, then it disabled the scollbar the dialog still cuts the content
[04:27:55] <murosai> but the*
[04:28:25] <Cork> murosai: jsfiddle?
[04:30:29] <murosai> okay let me try to simplify the code
[04:32:54] <DRSK> Cork Â» ok so I've tried .stop() on various places and combinations and I've also tried the .data() approach, none of which seem to be working for me. This is my latest abomination: http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/10/ where lines 17, 20, 26, 64 and 68 are all attempts at fixing the bug which appears if you switch from "foo" and "bar" too quickly or frequently. If you get a moment to take a look or suggest another approach I'd appreciate it.

[04:39:53] <mepl> Hi, I am trying to select attr id from the selected option. This is what i've done so far
[04:39:56] <mepl> $(this).closest('.addtrunknum').find('select option:selected').attr('id');
[04:39:58] <pessimism> "say I have nine elements. I have an nth-child(3) jQuery CSS selector I apply before and after an event. Because jQuery merely display:none the elements, it still counts the hidden elements in the DOM. Is there a way to count from only the array of remaining elements?" http://jsfiddle.net/pessimism/E95GX/
[04:39:59] <mepl> and it did not work, ideas?
[04:43:43] <bengalo> mepl: 1. are you sure you want the id and not the name/value? 2. does your stuff without the .attr('id') return anything?
[04:45:02] <DRSK> mepl Â» $( this ).find( ':selected' ).attr( 'id' ); ?
[04:45:17] <DRSK> depends on where you're doing it, hang on
[04:45:35] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/xg4cL/
[04:48:57] <Velveeta> pessimism: what if you add :visible to your selector like this? http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/1/
[04:49:16] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: hows it going man?
[04:49:24] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: Im back with yesterday's same problem :P
[04:49:30] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: slightly modified verison of it
[04:49:42] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: here's the updated issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22659371/get-jquery-dropdown-to-load-and-drop-gracefully
[04:50:34] <DaniG2k> any help much appreciated :)
[04:51:08] <bengalo> if you use firebug or whatever, you can check why your styles are not applied
[04:51:16] <bengalo> you can see what overrides them etc
[04:51:32] <bengalo> any developer plugin/ext should show that
[04:51:53] <bengalo> for your background thingie
[04:52:29] <Velveeta> well, you have inline css on those bounce-summary blocks that says display: block, that's why it's not using the external css, inline overrrides with specificity
[04:53:12] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/3fm2T/  why my </ul> it's written before ending <li> loop ?
[04:54:14] <bengalo> ?
[04:54:20] <bengalo> cuz u put it there=
[04:54:21] <bengalo> ?
[04:54:39] <bengalo> just put the ending tag after your last </li>
[04:55:53] <Velveeta> xnotte: you're appending nodes instead of markup
[04:56:15] <Velveeta> you should be concatenating a single string to pass to append(), not appending each string chunk
[04:57:53] <pessimism> Velveeta doesn't seem to be applied
[04:58:35] <Macaveli> What would be the best selector for this div? <div class="alert alert-error" style="display: none;"></div>
[04:58:36] <Velveeta> then you may need to split that selector up into 2 separate ones, one to first filter out the visible nodes, and the other to get your nth-child from that collection
[04:58:45] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: Im not sure I understand your advice
[04:59:15] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I tried removing/adding the display: block everywhere in the css
[04:59:32] <Velveeta> danig2k: not in the css, in the markup
[04:59:44] <Velveeta> you have it inlined o your element itself
[04:59:52] <pessimism> Velveeta as a CSS selector operation?
[05:00:24] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: can you give me an example plz? I dont see it
[05:00:40] <pessimism> brb
[05:01:01] <DaniG2k> what do you mean by markup, the html?
[05:01:25] <Velveeta> yes, i see this in the markup of the linked fiddle: <div class="bounce-summary" style="display: block;">Summary goes in here</div>
[05:02:39] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: hmm i wonder how that happened. Anyways, removing it doesnt make a difference: http://jsfiddle.net/a2geG/6/
[05:03:29] <repxl> can i stop display my website if the user has no javascript enabled?
[05:03:44] <repxl> and write something like , to see this website javascript must be enabled
[05:04:35] <xec> sure
[05:04:49] <Velveeta> danig2k: you're also not setting .bounce-summary to display: none anywhere that i can see, and you have .rounded-list div as display: block in that css, despite saying you removed all instances of display block (i spotted one other one also, but it wouldn't apply)... people have already posted about this specific instance of display block on your SO question, did you read the responses?
[05:04:49] <repxl> xec how
[05:04:51] <bengalo> there is probably some way with tags imo but you could defaultly display that message and make js hide it (not the best approach) ;)
[05:05:16] <xec> repxl: if your site has a containing element, hide it by default and show it with js
[05:05:37] <xec> repxl: and do the opposite (or use <noscript>) for the message
[05:05:54] <bengalo> riiight, noscript it is ;)
[05:06:50] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: Im reading but i suck at css -_-
[05:07:44] <Velveeta> pessimism: something like this, if that first option didn't work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/2/
[05:13:15] <pessimism> Velveeta I'll check it out in a few minutes, thanks a bunch
[05:13:25] <jenia> hello. I have a form where i do this:
[05:13:26] <jenia> 	$(function(){
[05:13:27] <jenia> 	    $("#location_form_" + outer_this.sp.db_index + " [name=opening_date]").datepicker();
[05:13:27] <jenia> 	});
[05:13:44] <jenia> the selector return the correct input field
[05:13:45] <Tekla> if i bind the .click to 'body' this is going to be 'body', won't it?
[05:13:54] <jenia> but theres no datepicker that appear there
[05:14:02] <jenia> can someone suggest why?
[05:14:49] <Cork> Tekla: yes, unless you use delegate
[05:15:13] <Cork> jenia: and no js errors?
[05:15:19] <jenia> nope
[05:19:21] <jenia> Cork, actually theres technically a date picker there
[05:20:12] <jenia> it just doesnt show up
[05:20:51] <Cork> jenia: do you have the needed css loaded?
[05:21:08] <jenia> let me check one second
[05:21:57] <jenia>   <link rel="stylesheet" type-"text/css" href="static/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom/css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.css" />
[05:22:09] <jenia> yea i think so. because when i use a dialog it works fine
[05:22:17] <Cork> depends
[05:22:34] <Cork> whats in custom depends on what you picked when you use the theme roller
[05:23:08] <Cork> you could try if http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.4/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css makes any difference
[05:24:51] <jenia> exactly right
[05:24:53] <jenia> thanks very much
[05:34:05] <Tekla> i dunno what i just did but chrome pops up its print facility when i load the page :)
[05:35:58] <Tekla> ah... just print() from jquery does that
[05:35:59] <bristleback> hi
[05:36:47] <bristleback> I have the following problem: I have a form containing two sections, each section being displayed in a table, and each one containing a various number of input elements
[05:37:13] <bristleback> the input elements in the second sections are generated with jquery by injecting HTML code in the DOM
[05:37:48] <bristleback> what I need is to serialize only the second section of the form separately from the first section
[05:39:03] <bristleback> my approach was to copy the html in the second table, create a javascript variable containing the HTML of what I need surrounded by <form> tags, and then I serialize the obtained form
[05:39:40] <bristleback> the problem is that the object resulting from this operation doesn't contain the values inserted in the input fields
[05:40:52] <bristleback> now, what I think about doing, is to attach an onchange event to each input element, which will call a function, which, in return, will set the attribute value of that respective input to what the user typed
[05:41:16] <bristleback> this way, when I copy the HTML I will also have the values typed in those inputs
[05:41:43] <bristleback> now, this approach is not very elegant, is prone to further errors and so one
[05:42:02] <bristleback> is there a better way to do this, or this is the only option there is
[05:42:04] <bristleback> ?
[06:03:27] <nisseni> Is it legit to set your own "data attributes" within an element tag? For example if I have an image, can I set <img src="image" data-image-id="xx" data-image-color="red"> ? This in order to use attr('data-image-id') in jQuery methods?
[06:03:47] <NeoThermic|Work> I'm having a bit of trouble with selectors; I'm trying to find a radio button that has a specific value via $('input[type="radio"][value="1557"]'), but that finds nothing. Have I missed something?
[06:03:55] <Hooloovoo> nisseni: yea that's what it's for
[06:03:58] <NeoThermic|Work> nisseni: that would be valid, yes.
[06:04:07] <Hooloovoo> nisseni: however, to access it from jquery you can use .data()
[06:04:47] <NeoThermic|Work> If you use .data, you don't need to include the data- bit either. So to find the data-image-color, you'd .data('image-color')
[06:05:28] <nisseni> ah, neat! Is it possible to reach elements like that? I mean for id I do $('#myId").doThis() - like a similar thing? Also, does this work on all browsers?
[06:06:47] <Hooloovoo> NeoThermic|Work: does it work you you remove the double quotes around the value?
[06:07:03] <Hooloovoo> and type
[06:08:14] <NeoThermic|Work> Hooloovoo: quotes around: both, no work; just value, no work; just type, no work; no quotes, no work.
[06:08:48] <Hooloovoo> NeoThermic|Work: :(
[06:08:51] <NeoThermic|Work> wait, hmm
[06:09:42] <NeoThermic|Work> sweet, that has worked.
[06:09:49] <Hooloovoo> Nice :)
[06:11:59] <lsfc1914> Hello. I have a table with 5 rows and button "Add row" which adds new rows to table. Each of the new added rows have a button which purpose is to delete them. Here is the problem - I can't put the code for deleting these row in $(document).ready() because the page is not loading scripts again when I add new row to the table. Can you point me a solution to this problem?
[06:12:06] <ocx> hi
[06:12:17] <ocx> i need to change the default colors of jqm
[06:12:20] <ocx> how can i do it
[06:12:29] <ocx> i am not able to trace which css style to change
[06:12:33] <Hooloovoo> lsfc1914: Have a look at delegation
[06:12:34] <HiMaX> why do i have to use event as $(document).ready(function() { and $(document).click(function() { to make the page show this $("#title").html(myvar); ?
[06:12:48] <HiMaX> i dont want use event , just display it $("#title").html(myvar); :(
[06:12:52] <Hooloovoo> lsfc1914: You can basically bind to the parent <table> element, but have it trigger on the buttons.
[06:13:07] <seutje> HiMaX: put it at the bottom then
[06:13:47] <seutje> it's essentially the same as doc.rdy, but since ur being all iffy about that
[06:14:04] <HiMaX> seutje: how is it even its possible with no including $(document).ready(function() { and $(document).click(function() {
[06:14:30] <BinaryKitten> HiMaX you need the document ready if you're putting code in the head as the scripts will get parsed and processed before the body content will .
[06:14:31] <seutje> erm, iono, cause it was designed like that? o.O
[06:14:48] <seutje> I don't understand the question :(
[06:14:53] <BinaryKitten> so at the time of processing, the element with id "ttle" is not there
[06:15:02] <rethus> i have this now to check if jquery and jquery-ui is loaded. http://privatepaste.com/bfbe87d948
[06:15:16] <BinaryKitten> HiMaX thus document ready event fires once all the content is there and ready for interaction
[06:15:21] <rethus> but sometimes jquery ui is loaded, and sometimes not
[06:15:33] <rethus> is anything wrong with the script?
[06:16:16] <HiMaX> BinaryKitten: so you in meaning i cannot use  $("#title").html(myvar); without event function wrapped around it ?
[06:17:00] <BinaryKitten> not unless you put your code AFTER the document. by that i mean just before the </body> tag
[06:17:27] <BinaryKitten> at which point, the script will process after the rest of the document, which as seutje said, is like document ready but without the event
[06:18:31] <HiMaX> BinaryKitten: okay i think am understand now, thanks and seutje too :)
[06:18:48] * BinaryKitten hi5s seutje
[06:18:56] <seutje> rethus: typeof window.jQuery == 'undefined' <- there's no risk of accidental falsyness, so might as well just if (window.jQuery)
[06:19:31] * seutje was not prepared and catches 5 to the face
[06:20:03] <rethus> seutje: I've read, IE need this "undefined" requst
[06:20:31] <seutje> rethus: not if you call it as a property on the window object
[06:20:36] <BinaryKitten> rethus why not just chain them
[06:21:22] <seutje> there's tiny libraries for doing just this btw
[06:22:08] <rethus> seutje: which one ?
[06:22:13] <seutje> frankly, if jQuery is undefined, this script will throw an error
[06:22:26] <seutje> on the window.jQuery.ui call
[06:22:31] <BinaryKitten> http://privatepaste.com/f7d8026182
[06:22:36] <BinaryKitten> = chained loading
[06:22:51] <BinaryKitten> if the jQuery isn't loaded properly jQuery ui will not exist
[06:23:01] <BinaryKitten> also, try require JS
[06:23:34] <seutje> or like yepnope if u don't wanna convert the whole shebang
[06:24:00] <seutje> why is this thing flagging the closing tag though
[06:24:31] <dylix> for some reason this json isnt settings cookies https://dylix.org/comics/
[06:25:00] <dylix> ah nm, fixed it
[06:25:49] <seutje> tbh I wouldn't expect a data format to set cookies all by itself :P
[06:26:02] <dylix> i meant jquery :P its early
[06:27:50] <coRz> anyone needs help with something?
[06:28:08] <dylix> i could use some coffee, thx corz
[06:28:18] <rethus> seutje same result. sometimes it is loaded, sometimes not.
[06:28:38] <rethus> i see it on the error that .dialog is undefined
[06:29:27] <seutje> rethus: when do you execute this dialog call?
[06:29:30] <danieka> Hi everyone. I would like some help regarding jQuery mobile and listviews. I want to remove elements from the list when the user clicks on it, and I've got that down. But now I only want to listen to clicks on the minus-icon. I can't see a html element that contains the icon. Do I have to skip the inbuilt icons and manually create a html element to listen to? If you want to see it in action, go to mdi14.no-ip.org, open menu and go to
[06:29:30] <danieka> the playlist editor, that's the listview I'm talking about. All help is greatly appreciated.
[06:29:44] <rethus> after $(document).ready(function(){
[06:30:01] <coRz> dylix, just made myself some coffee ;)
[06:30:04] <seutje> not in the callback for the script onload?
[06:30:48] <rethus> you mean inside of the if(!doneâ€¦)  ?
[06:31:15] <danieka> tl;dr How do I listen to click only on the icon in listviews?
[06:31:41] <rethus> ah, i see inside of the loadjQuery('//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js', function(){â€¦â€¦here make the .dialog-stuff});
[06:32:17] <aitiba> hi

[07:02:16] <ankurk_> coRz: what did you do there? e.PreventDefault?
[07:02:33] <coRz> yeah and the class you removed was the problem
[07:02:51] <coRz> the .hidden
[07:04:02] <ankurk_> but I have to remove the class since it is hidden

[07:08:12] <HiMaX> everything broken it is now. Page is show all blank white page. Please for expert help it is easy this for expert here http://bpaste.net/show/193927/
[07:09:34] <coRz> HiMax, $("#title").html(settings.title);
[07:09:48] <coRz> HiMax, dont use html use text
[07:10:49] <coRz> HiMax, and function cant be declared with '-'
[07:11:07] <coRz> HiMax, <body onload="settings-page();"> remove the -
[07:11:09] <HiMaX> coRz: i use the $("#title").text(settings.title); but still it white page
[07:11:15] <coRz> onload...
[07:11:22] <coRz> remove the '-'
[07:11:29] <coRz> to this: <body onload="settingspage();">
[07:11:39] <coRz> and ofc the function name too
[07:11:59] <coRz> user camel-case
[07:12:05] <coRz> settingsPage()
[07:12:11] <coRz> use*
[07:13:01] <coRz> HiMaX, understand?
[07:13:09] <HiMaX> coRz: <body onload="settingsPage();">  still make white page no of it output :(
[07:13:28] <coRz> change the function name too...
[07:13:33] <HiMaX> changed in the function of it too from code
[07:13:48] <coRz> chech if you got jquery in the directory
[07:13:57] <coRz> you got this: <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
[07:14:07] <coRz> jquery-1.10.2.min.js does this exists?
[07:14:20] <HiMaX> coRz: yes it loaded in directory
[07:14:29] <dave_s> Can anyone help me figure out why I can't prevent this form from submitting? http://jsfiddle.net/ckm5r/1/
[07:14:33] <HiMaX> same directory
[07:15:24] <coRz> http://bpaste.net/show/azAbvloBL0ayMGqOTRsa/ works fine..
[07:17:02] <bengalo> dave_s .submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); .... });
[07:17:28] <dave_s> bengalo: return false; is the same as e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation().
[07:18:02] <HiMaX> coRz: i copied that your paste , but still i have it the blank page no output
[07:18:12] <bengalo> true, didnt even check for that, just skimming for preventDefault ;/
[07:19:47] <dave_s> bengalo: Actually, adding that at the beginning of the function permits this to work, however returning false should work too and so that seems hacky. :S
[07:20:26] <coRz> HiMaX, everything works fine... check the console log for errors
[07:21:04] <HiMaX> coRz: it working! I made it typo jquery-1.10.2min.js :)
[07:21:08] <K-202> Hi. How to find an element (:input) AFTER given element? But it may be in another DOM branch (so we might want to look up first, then down/right)
[07:21:10] <bengalo> dave_s: i never actually use return false for stuff like this, but yeah, it prob should still work
[07:21:28] <HiMaX> coRz: thanks you in very much :)
[07:21:32] <dave_s> bengalo: But it doesn't. :(
[07:23:18] <HiMaX> coRz: so i never must it use of "-" symbol in the function naming. I learned today :)
[07:23:37] <NoiseEee> HiMaX: because - is a mathematical operator
[07:24:24] <HiMaX> NoiseEee: +1 :)
[07:24:45] <bengalo> dave_s
[07:24:49] <bengalo> it might be
[07:24:57] <bengalo> because youre using return false somewhere else
[07:25:11] <bengalo> and that prevents your event here of bubbling at all
[07:25:15] <bengalo> or getting reached
[07:25:37] <BillCriswell> K-202: Is it definitely in a common parent?
[07:28:14] <coRz> back
[07:29:05] <pessimism> anyone knows whether combining selectors like :visible with something like :first-child is supported? I've tried all permutations, and I can't get it to change the element I want
[07:29:19] <pessimism> i.e. a:visible:first-child
[07:29:27] <quicksilver> it's permitted it just doesn't mean what you want
[07:29:27] <pessimism> *e.g.
[07:29:32] <pessimism> oh?
[07:29:46] <BillCriswell> pessimism: It would only select visible first-childs, not the first child that's visible.
[07:29:51] <quicksilver> that means all <a> objects which are visible and the first children of their parents
[07:29:56] <coRz> pessimism, yes
[07:29:58] <BillCriswell> pessimism: That one took me for a loop.
[07:30:02] <quicksilver> not "first visible children" which is prehaps what you meant.
[07:30:05] <quicksilver> or hoped for.
[07:30:19] <pessimism> as in "of the visible <a>, pick the first one"
[07:30:19] <coRz> pessimism, .not(':visible').is(':first-child')
[07:30:28] <coRz> or whatever you want
[07:30:34] <BillCriswell> $('a:visible').first()
[07:30:42] <coRz> or that...
[07:30:44] <quicksilver> 'a:visible:eq(0)'
[07:30:54] <quicksilver> but that's the first first visible a on your page
[07:31:00] <quicksilver> not each of the first one of several groups
[07:31:10] <quicksilver> it's all about knowing what you actually wanted
[07:31:31] <pessimism> hmm
[07:31:35] <pessimism> I'll check it out, thanks
[07:31:50] <coRz> good luck
[07:31:50] <pessimism> so much help I almost couldn't keep up with the chat :)
[07:31:51] <xec> pessimism: so what is it you really wanted?
[07:32:13] <BillCriswell> pessimism: I think it's just everyone was confused by that in the past haha.
[07:33:08] <pessimism> xec This is from an earlier example: http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/
[07:33:28] <pessimism> I'll throw in the original CSS to have it make more sense, sec
[07:34:10] <pessimism> Here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/3/
[07:34:38] <pessimism> I filter away some elements with .hide(), and I want to re-apply the CSS on the remaining elements, basically
[07:34:43] <xec> how does this explain what you want?
[07:35:09] <pessimism> oops, updating css
[07:35:09] <coRz> lol
[07:35:24] <xec> oh i think i know what you mean. you want to select the oranges as if the apples weren't in the dom
[07:35:39] <xec> so to speak
[07:35:42] <davesleep> what is the command to make jqueryUI acccordian not be as large as th elargest
[07:35:46] <davesleep> piece of content
[07:35:51] <BillCriswell> ".oranges:nth-child(3n) + .oranges" Would this be .oranges:nth-child(4n) ?
[07:36:20] <pessimism> http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/7/
[07:36:33] <pessimism> BillCriswell Yep
[07:36:43] <BillCriswell> davesleep: It looks like { heightStyle: "content" }
[07:36:52] <davesleep> ahhh cheers
[07:36:59] <BillCriswell> davesleep: https://jqueryui.com/accordion/ Many answers here.
[07:37:11] <davesleep> kept trying auto height
[07:37:37] <davesleep> like i couldn't google the right term
[07:37:46] <bengalo> (thats what i thought)
[07:37:47] <bengalo> ;>>>
[07:38:04] <xec> pessimism: if you use ".nth-child" selectors, they look at all elements, hidden or not. if you want the third .orange you coud do $(".oranges").eq(2) instead
[07:38:10] <bengalo> ive skimmed through the jquery ui dialogs/draggable page like a million times imo
[07:38:39] <pessimism> xec Alright, that should fix it, then
[07:38:45] <xec> pessimism: .eq() applies to the collection, while :nth-child() looks at all siblings (regardless of classname or hidden etc)
[07:39:04] <pessimism> xec Ah, I thought I could counteract that with a :visible selector
[07:40:03] <BillCriswell> davesleep: Haha, yeah it happens.
[07:40:20] <xec> pessimism: the more you add to the selector, the fewer things match. ":visible:first-child" means "first child *and* visible", not "the first visible"
[07:41:59] <pessimism> ah
[07:43:36] <pessimism> alright, set it up. Everything except .eq(1) works: http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/9/
[07:44:50] <xec> pessimism: are you sure? .eq(3) is the fourth orange (doesn't exist, same goes for 4)
[07:44:59] <xec> .eq(1) should be the second
[07:45:50] <pessimism> ah, it's zero-indexed. Then it's a wonder it's working in the first place. Gonna give it a second look. (I'm using it on a separate piece of code, the jsfiddle is just as a demo)
[07:45:52] <pessimism> :)
[07:46:32] <xec> pessimism: http://jsfiddle.net/E95GX/10/
[07:46:49] <xec> `api eq @ pessimism
[07:46:49] <b-ot> pessimism: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[07:47:46] <anli_> console.log("foo"); stopped produce output
[07:47:51] <anli_> However, debugger; still works
[07:47:52] <anli_> (firefox)
[07:48:00] <anli_> I have tried to restart ff
[07:49:36] <anli_> I fail to search for add-ons in firefox
[07:50:11] <pessimism> brb
[07:50:23] <xec> not to worry, i'm sure #jquery has the solution! ;)
[07:51:57] <amigojapan> hey guys, I am new to jquery, I am trying to make a new dinamic div, and I want it to be draggable....  this is what I have http://192.168.1.100/easypageeditor/edit.html   any ideas?
[07:52:38] <xec> that's a lan ip
[07:52:51] <amigojapan> oh sorry xec , let me fix that
[07:53:30] <amigojapan> there we go http://amigojapan.duckdns.org/easypageeditor/edit.html
[07:53:38] <xec> http://p2127-ipbf2705souka.saitama.ocn.ne.jp/easypageeditor/edit.html seemed to work ;)
[07:53:46] <amigojapan> yeah
[07:54:21] <xec> it looks like you're calling .draggable() before the div exists
[07:55:17] <amigojapan> xec: wouldnt appendChild make the div exist?
[07:55:47] <xec> yes, but it wouldn't be draggable, as .draggable() were called on an empty collection earlier
[07:55:53] <xec> were? was?
[07:56:30] <xec> you're not just new to jquery are you
[07:56:33] <amigojapan> hmmm, xec are you talking about the portions of hte code I commented out?
[07:56:37] <xec> you're new to javascript as well? :)
[07:56:51] <xec> var k=document.createElement('d'); ? create a <d> element?
[07:56:55] <amigojapan> xec: well, I have used JS before, but I am no expert
[07:57:01] <b-ot> xec: No output.
[07:57:08] <xec> lol silly b-ot
[07:58:00] <amigojapan> yeah xec I am unfamilliar with that, but it seems to work, cause the div does seem to appear
[07:58:24] <xec> amigojapan: nevermind i see the second .draggable() call
[07:58:28] <xec> you had some earlier as well
[07:58:37] <xec> amigojapan: i see what you're trying to do now
[07:58:51] <amigojapan> xec: those are commented out
[07:58:53] <xec> amigojapan: you're not creating a <div id="d"> you are creating a <d>
[07:59:03] <amigojapan> ah ok
[07:59:05] <xec> amigojapan: no its a separate <script>
[07:59:21] <amigojapan> hmm ok
[07:59:32] <xec> amigojapan: anyway you dont need to select it again, just do $(k).draggable()
[07:59:50] <amigojapan> ah, thanks xec, let me try that
[08:00:39] <amigojapan> thanks xec!!!
[08:01:01] <xec> passing a dom element node object to jquery will return a jquery object containing that element
[08:01:46] <amigojapan> thanx xec, I think I get it, but jquery seems pretty confusing,   compared to just plain JS
[08:02:06] <xec> yes you should definitely learn plain javascript properly first
[08:02:58] <amigojapan> thanx though xec, it seems to work now
[08:03:07] <xec> good :) glad it worked
[08:03:36] <amigojapan> :)
[08:12:53] <loincloth> i'm having difficulty writing tests for behavior triggered by scroll events
[08:13:37] <loincloth> there seems to be a timing issue related to the async nature of those behaviors... i found some writing on related concerns where it was claimed explicitly triggering the window scroll event will get around that
[08:14:05] <loincloth> but i'm not finding that to be the case... i'm seeing the window event triggered, my test assertions happening, and then later the behavior from my scroll event callback
[08:14:22] <loincloth> has anybody run into similar issues?
[08:14:43] <pessimism> is there a jQuery equivalent to :nth-child(3n)?
[08:14:55] <pessimism> or rather, something like .eq(3n)
[08:17:39] <shoky> .filter(':nth-child(3n)')
[08:19:04] <BillCriswell> So tempted to use a 1px by 1x1 transparent gif right now lol
[08:19:51] <shoky> i dare you
[08:20:05] <BillCriswell> It'll kill my street cred.
[08:20:12] <shoky> heh
[08:21:16] <farn5w0rth> will the jquery .append() add to the end of my existing code or will it replace it? ex. if i had <th class="db_address_heading">Address</th> and i did a $(â€œ.db_address_headingâ€).append(â€œ&nbsp;<img..>â€); would it replace my â€œAddressâ€ with the image or would it add to it?
[08:21:34] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: No, it would append.
[08:22:06] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: meaning it would add to it?
[08:22:41] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:22:46] <BillCriswell> It would append to it.
[08:23:03] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: thank you very much :)
[08:23:49] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:26:29] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking a 1x1 px would be much better for performance shoky.
[08:26:33] <BillCriswell> Tell me it's ok.
[08:26:48] <shoky> no idea, what're you doing
[08:28:18] <decx> now i'm curious as well but not enough to scroll up and read BillCriswell
[08:28:19] <BillCriswell> Trying to maintain a auto height in a div with a bunch of absolutely positioned elements.
[08:28:35] <decx> autoheight again
[08:28:40] <decx> it's your nemesis
[08:28:45] <shoky> whatcha mean by auto height
[08:28:57] <BillCriswell> If the width changes the height will as well.
[08:29:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[08:29:52] <BillCriswell> I know I could adjust the container on resize but that feels icky.
[08:30:27] <BillCriswell> Not sure my brain is working right today.
[08:30:42] <shoky> you mean you wanna use the img for this cause <img>s already do that for you?
[08:30:53] <shoky> not sure i'm following
[08:31:06] <BillCriswell> Yes, the issue is the images have to be absolute since I'm fading in and out.
[08:31:37] * shoky squints
[08:31:44] <shoky> i'd need a fiddle to understand ;p
[08:36:37] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://jsbin.com/lizopahu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:37:31] <repxl> im using each key, value when i print key i see 2 "results" and "status" when i print value i get "2 objects", "OK"    how i can go into the next object ?
[08:41:34] <repxl> i should use on every json object a new $each ?
[08:43:49] * BillCriswell stands perfectly still
[08:48:07] <decx> what like this? http://jsbin.com/lizopahu/8/edit
[08:49:40] <BillCriswell> The padding bottom is relative with the width, huh?
[08:49:48] <decx> don'T ask me why
[08:50:01] <decx> i use it for responsive iframes and embeds and it works well
[08:50:25] <BillCriswell> Well that is exactly what I Was going for, so thanks!
[08:50:29] <BillCriswell> shoky: It's good!
[08:54:22] <repxl> man fu ck $.each  when i  output value i get 2 fu cking values i want check just the key "status" value
[08:54:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:54:33] <repxl> how i can just call the key "status" value
[08:54:44] <duch_kazatel> do you have a fiddle?
[08:55:13] <BillCriswell> decx: Stinks something like this feels so counter intuitive.
[08:55:31] <duch_kazatel> awww i missed all the fun this morning didn't i?
[08:55:35] <BillCriswell> decx: Luckily it works well.
[08:55:50] <decx> yeah i have no idea why padding is relative to width
[08:55:56] <DarsVaeda> how do I select an input by name with array syntax?
[08:56:11] <decx> padding-bottom that is
[08:56:16] <DarsVaeda> is it possible?
[08:56:19] <duch_kazatel> DarsVaeda that question is nonsensical.
[08:56:25] <duch_kazatel> DarsVaeda fiddle it :)
[08:56:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. It was a question I had about keeping a parent the height of it's absolutely positioned children.
[08:56:55] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah bummer for you there :D
[08:56:59] <DarsVaeda> <input type="text" name="foo[bar]" /> ... $('input[name=foo[bar]]")
[08:57:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha, decx got it pretty quick.
[08:57:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/lizopahu/7/edit?css,output
[08:57:20] <duch_kazatel> DarsVaeda I see some strings there - those aren't arrays.
[08:57:20] <repxl> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/   i want only check the second key "status" if it's OK for the other 2 objects i want to do a new loop if OK is checked
[08:57:46] <duch_kazatel> DarsVaeda if you want to select off the name attribute, you want $('input[name='foo[bar]']")
[08:57:47] <DarsVaeda> duch_kazatel: maybe array is not the right word
[08:57:56] <DarsVaeda> ahh
[08:57:57] <duch_kazatel> DarsVaeda it's just a string like any other.
[08:58:14] <repxl> duch_kazatel ? hm
[08:58:20] <duch_kazatel> repxl looking now.
[08:58:47] <duch_kazatel> repxl so you want to know the status?
[08:59:06] <DarsVaeda> duch_kazatel: thx, that worked
[08:59:51] <duch_kazatel> repxl something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/1/
[09:00:20] <repxl> duch_kazatel i see now [object Object],[object Object] OK   but i want see only OK
[09:00:29] <repxl> duch_kazatel sry for my bad explaining ..
[09:00:36] <BillCriswell> I feel pretty damn ignorant for not knowing that decx haha
[09:00:44] <BillCriswell> Seems insanely useful.
[09:01:01] <duch_kazatel> repxl what do you want to see where you currently see the [object Object] ?
[09:01:16] <duch_kazatel> repxl this is basic object traversal, so it's pretty simple stuff.
[09:01:53] <repxl> duch_kazatel nothing i want see only the OK than i check if the OK is really OK and than i will use the first 2 objects on which i will again do a each loop
[09:01:55] <decx> BillCriswell i learned it from the fitvids plugin. it just looks what the width/height ratio of a video is and sets the appropriate inline style paddin-bottom
[09:02:26] <duch_kazatel> repxl then you don't want the loop yet - you're confused about what's what.
[09:02:37] <repxl> duch_kazatel the first 2 objects are key "results" the second OK is key "status"  so i want only to retrive the OK
[09:02:42] <Whirl3d> If you request an html document, can the contents be returned malformed, then use jquery to reassemble it?
[09:02:53] <decx> js based recalc on resize is unbearable
[09:03:02] <duch_kazatel> repxl then this is all you need: http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/2/
[09:03:17] <duch_kazatel> repxl that checks the status object in the returned data.
[09:03:47] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed. I was reading to use a transparent gif like the good old days.
[09:03:51] <BillCriswell> I was ready*
[09:04:24] <Whirl3d> in other words, if you had a php script that returned the <html><head></head><body></body></html> tags then included another php script that had <p>something</p> could you use jquery to put the <p> in the <body>?
[09:04:32] <decx> anoter option would be to always have the first child positioned relative and only the others absolute
[09:04:46] <computer2000> i need to place a text on a path, aligned to it. anyone can point me to how to achieve this? canvas?
[09:04:56] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d sure.  you'd use document fragments, though that hardly makes sense to do with javascript.
[09:05:15] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d you shouldn't be duplicating/replacing html, head, and body.
[09:05:57] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, I also considered that. I didn't feel like figuring out if it would make any of the fades weird.
[09:06:07] <decx> it does
[09:06:14] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, thanks for the reply, I wouldn't be duplicating anything, really.
[09:06:43] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d so your original page would be the "shell", and then you'd fetch individual areas with ajax?
[09:06:45] <duch_kazatel> that's normal.
[09:06:47] <Whirl3d> But rather than keep track of "open" tags like <html><body>, I wanted to close them and then append more text after
[09:07:06] <decx> the padding way is still hacky, should be in a css spec, max-width&ratio
[09:07:16] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d huh?
[09:07:25] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d you mean you want to append to nodes?  that's easy.
[09:07:25] <Whirl3d> My original page would be the "site-level" context. Then the section template stuff would load next, then the content.
[09:07:46] <Whirl3d> but the sections would be empty. and the "site-level" elements would be empty
[09:07:54] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d yeah, your ajax calls would append to the appropriate area.
[09:08:03] <Whirl3d> afterwards, I'd use js to put the content in the right places
[09:08:08] <duch_kazatel> this is a perfect use case for promises if you're firing off all your requests at once.
[09:08:20] <Whirl3d> I figured I would use php includes to include the pieces
[09:08:46] <Whirl3d> so I would end up with a long messed up text file and a script would fix it.
[09:08:57] <duch_kazatel> that's not the right way to do it.
[09:09:04] <duch_kazatel> setup endpoints that return only what they need to return.
[09:09:25] <repxl> duch_kazatel so whenever a [Object ] occurs i need to loop it right ?
[09:09:40] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?  no.
[09:09:50] <Whirl3d> I reallly appreciate your help, but I think I am not explaining myself correctly. Gimme just a minute to write it out. brb
[09:10:28] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d if you're suggesting that you'd create a single point that'd shoot out everything in a big ol' string, and then you'd shuffle it back into place, that's a Bad Idea(tm)
[09:11:09] <repxl> duch_kazatel and how i can go inside a [Object object] ?
[09:11:30] <duch_kazatel> repxl my calling that property.  link me the fiddle so I can show you.
[09:12:14] <duch_kazatel> nvm i have iut.

[09:12:46] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/3/
[09:12:48] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[09:15:23] <duch_kazatel> repxl see http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/3/
[09:15:25] <repxl> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/4/
[09:15:26] <duch_kazatel> simple stuff
[09:15:41] <duch_kazatel> use console, not alert btw
[09:16:00] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/3/
[09:16:15] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to print a string representation of a relatively complex object.
[09:16:17] <repxl> duch_kazatel y but i get [object Object],[object Object]
[09:16:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/6/ <-- also what I just said.
[09:16:32] <repxl> duch_kazatel what is if i want to go inside that [object Object] and use data
[09:16:50] <duch_kazatel> then you need to hit the properties that contain the data you want.
[09:17:02] <aitiba> some can help me with a CORS get request please?
[09:17:06] <aitiba> someone*

[09:17:40] <duch_kazatel> repxl so what's a piece of data you want to display?
[09:17:48] <rus_> hi all
[09:18:09] <duch_kazatel> repxl because here's one example: http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/7/
[09:18:42] <repxl> duch_kazatel look so i basically don't need any loop lol http://jsfiddle.net/Rg5K4/8/
[09:19:12] <duch_kazatel> repxl now, if you wanted to iterate through all the objects in the results array, or you wanted to enumerate over all the object somewhere else, then you'd use something like each or a for...in or a simple for loop
[09:19:19] <Ownix> If I mouse in real fast and mouse out the .noti-header class is never fadded out http://jsfiddle.net/tn3bg/
[09:19:37] <Ownix> Is this a bug or is my code not right?
[09:19:51] <aitiba> I have this jquery http://pastebin.com/4jGdACUV but I get "Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." error. allow-origin is set to * ¿any ideas please?
[09:20:04] <duch_kazatel> Ownix when dealing with animations, you have to handle cases where you do something before an event finishes
[09:20:21] <duch_kazatel> aitiba what server are you using?
[09:20:53] <duch_kazatel> ah wait i see it - aitiba http://burujabetech.net/laravel-angular-comment-app/public/api/comments/1 <- these guys might not allow you do do that.
[09:21:01] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: Is there another event that will trigger I can hook into?
[09:21:16] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: I use php with laravel4
[09:21:41] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: the problem is that Access-Control-Allow-Origin is not allowed for localhost?
[09:21:45] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you're hooked to the mouseenter and mouseleave events i'm betting.  you need to figure out how to handle cases where you fire an animation, then "prematurely" trigger the event.
[09:22:01] <duch_kazatel> aitiba the problem is the server for http://burujabetech.net/ doesn't allow it.
[09:22:15] <duch_kazatel> that server needs to allow it before you can go on.
[09:22:33] <aitiba> allow what? Access-Control-Allow-Origin to burujabetech.net?
[09:22:51] <duch_kazatel> the server at  burujabetech.net needs to enable CORS.
[09:23:11] <duch_kazatel> !g enable cors @ aitiba

[09:23:20] <duch_kazatel> http://enable-cors.org/ - that's what you want.
[09:23:22] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok great now if i have done some validation and have some data how i can pass it to php to continue proccessing the data on the php side ? by ajax ?
[09:24:40] <duch_kazatel> repxl you have to submit that data somehow.  the php end needs to have some kind of enpoint that preferably allows you to POST to it.
[09:26:38] <repxl> duch_kazatel hmmm im using $("#forms").submit(function() and here is my getJSON ...
[09:26:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl right - what do you have on the PHP side to accept that form?
[09:27:21] <repxl> duch_kazatel a submit input ehh ?
[09:27:27] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?
[09:27:47] <repxl> duch_kazatel i don't know what you mean bro :/
[09:27:56] <duch_kazatel> repxl is that form getting handled on the PHP side?
[09:28:07] <duch_kazatel> like, you submit a form.  then what?  what does the PHP do with it?
[09:28:16] <repxl> duch_kazatel yes i do a php validation
[09:28:29] <duch_kazatel> okay.  then what is your question?
[09:28:36] <duch_kazatel> you're submitting the data via a form.
[09:29:01] <repxl> duch_kazatel how to transfer the data that i get from getJSON to php  now to save it into a database for example
[09:29:34] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: if CORS is enabled on my server, I would see "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" on request headers of the firebug right?
[09:29:44] <duch_kazatel> you have to either populate a form and submit that, or serialize that data and POST it.
[09:30:59] <duch_kazatel> repxl btw - if you're doing this to work around some kind of limitation in the maps API, they will figure out what you're doing eventually.
[09:31:14] <rus_> hi guys, this may seem like a foolish question, but does anyone consider jquery mobile a suitable foundation for a desktop site?
[09:31:26] <duch_kazatel> rus_ no.  i would never use it for desktop.
[09:31:57] <repxl> duch_kazatel hmm it's not forbidden i mean maps api is based on the ip address this way the ip address will be the clients not the server so the limitations will increase.
[09:32:12] <duch_kazatel> repxl you're submitting data to your server to save for later, right?
[09:32:20] <duch_kazatel> repxl because that's shady business.
[09:32:25] <duch_kazatel> just a heads-up
[09:32:42] <rus_> duch_kazatel, here is my issue, I have my desktop site, I want to make it more viable on a range of mobile devices, yet I see running two sets of pages and code i.e. mobile and desktop as undesirable.....
[09:32:42] <duch_kazatel> either way, you should probably go lean about how to submit data to a server.
[09:32:57] <duch_kazatel> rus_ then do a responsive site.
[09:33:09] <rus_> I was thinking of responsive design using the jquery mobile...
[09:33:09] <duch_kazatel> rus_ otherwise, you'll end up having a terrible desktop experience.
[09:33:16] <duch_kazatel> rus_ don't use jquery mobile to do that.
[09:33:32] <duch_kazatel> either build out a separate frontend for mobile and use jquery mobile there, or build a responsive site.
[09:33:58] <duch_kazatel> but don't try to make a desktop site using jquery mobile.
[09:34:19] <CrowX-> if you do JSON.stringify to an empty array, what will be the resulting string?
[09:34:34] <repxl> duch_kazatel well it does not matter for me im also learning the relation ship between js and php, i have get the api data on the js side that is fine but i want to use that data now on the php side. you know
[09:34:35] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- Did You Try? (tm)
[09:34:58] <CrowX-> or, which string would create an empty array if used in JSON.parse
[09:35:04] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, i haven't tried anything
[09:35:10] <duch_kazatel> repxl PHP renders stuff out to the page.  javascript interacts with the rendered result.
[09:35:15] <rus_> I thought the idea of a responsive site was to use media querys and one set framework?
[09:35:27] <duch_kazatel> rus_ right - jquery mobile is not the library to use to do that.
[09:35:31] <rus_> i.e. design from mobile upwards using media queiries?
[09:35:42] <repxl> duch_kazatel so the only one way is to use ajax to can use that js data on the php side ?
[09:36:14] <duch_kazatel> repxl ajax is one way to do it.  to send data to the server-side, you have to either submit it in a form or via ajax.
[09:36:25] <duch_kazatel> note that AJAX ends up being very functionally similar to forms, btw.
[09:36:39] <duch_kazatel> all ajax really does is enable you to submit requests to servers without reloading the page.
[09:37:08] <duch_kazatel> Ajax is short for asynchronous javascript and xml.
[09:37:27] <duch_kazatel> the "xml" part can be replaced with any kind of data, really.
[09:38:12] <duch_kazatel> JSON, CSV, whatever.
[09:38:15] <repxl> duch_kazatel oh wait i get it now you mean i can append that API data from js to the form so i don't need ajax than all i do is the php side
[09:39:25] <duch_kazatel> repxl sure - you could populate the form with your data.
[09:39:35] <duch_kazatel> repxl but keep in mind the page will refresh when you submit.
[09:40:06] <repxl> duch_kazatel y but the api call is still from client side ;)  i don't care about refresh, refresh is sexy
[09:40:12] <duch_kazatel> repxl lmao
[09:40:20] <duch_kazatel> repxl either way, yes, that is one way to do it.
[09:44:33] <sky> im trying to use $(this).find('select').val() to find multiple selected values in a div
[09:44:38] <sky> but it only finds the first..
[09:44:49] <duch_kazatel> sky fiddle it?
[09:45:24] <nhulea> hey guys I am releasing the v1 of my image painting website its only version one so there are still some hiccups but for the most part it works have a look and thanks for the help in here for sure I really appreciate it alot
[09:45:26] <nhulea> http://yourimage.io/
[09:45:44] <sky> IE multple selected options, not multiple selections in a list
[09:45:56] <duch_kazatel> sky a representation of the code would be helpful.
[09:48:10] <sky> http://jsfiddle.net/mZ3gp/
[09:48:38] <duch_kazatel> use console.log btw
[09:49:01] <duch_kazatel> and your code, right now, is trying to iterate through every div on the page.
[09:49:36] <sky> and i missed a closing option tag
[09:49:41] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:49:43] <sky> but it operates the same
[09:49:46] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/mZ3gp/1/
[09:49:48] <sky> i want the value one and two
[09:49:49] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[09:50:04] <duch_kazatel> you want $('div select').each(function () { and then var item = ($(this).val());
[09:50:25] <repxl> duch_kazatel look bro i trying to literate now the 4 objects and it just comes out 4 times undefined .. lol http://jsfiddle.net/MP3uS/
[09:51:14] <duch_kazatel> sky this time with event handling: http://jsfiddle.net/mZ3gp/3/
[09:51:26] <duch_kazatel> repxl don't use alerts.
[09:51:49] <repxl> duch_kazatel yea but where the fu ck is console on jsfiddle :D ?
[09:51:54] <duch_kazatel> *fuck
[09:51:58] <duch_kazatel> just curse or don't.
[09:52:06] <duch_kazatel> and it's in your dev tools.
[09:52:15] <duch_kazatel> repxl what browser/os are you using?
[09:52:29] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: these callbacks are frustrating. You would expect the events to go their full cycle when triggered not suddenly exit.
[09:52:59] <duch_kazatel> Ownix not to me.  you're calling a function.
[09:53:02] <duch_kazatel> that's really all it is.
[09:53:41] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: but the function is exiting pre-matruely right?
[09:53:44] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok you mean i should use firebug ok
[09:53:48] <duch_kazatel> Ownix nope.
[09:53:49] <sky> thanks duch_kazatel
[09:53:58] <duch_kazatel> repxl if you have firebug, sure.
[09:53:59] <sky> i figured a similar method :)
[09:54:04] <duch_kazatel> or chrome's dev tools.
[09:54:14] <duch_kazatel> sky cool!  glad I could help.
[09:55:33] <repxl> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/MP3uS/2/ ok updated
[09:56:17] <duch_kazatel> repxl so you want to iterate through every object in data['results'][0]['address_components'] ?
[09:56:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/MP3uS/3/
[09:56:55] <repxl> duch_kazatel yes
[09:56:56] <duch_kazatel> because there they are.
[09:57:00] <duch_kazatel> remove the key.
[09:57:03] <duch_kazatel> just use value.
[09:58:31] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: can you clarify on whats happeneing? Mousin fires my Open() function, mouseout fires my Close() function. They both run so how can one suddenly stop?
[09:58:45] <duch_kazatel> Ownix neither is "stopping".
[09:58:55] <duch_kazatel> neither is waiting for the other to finish, either.
[09:59:01] <duch_kazatel> you're confused about queueing
[09:59:06] <Ownix> yes
[09:59:23] <duch_kazatel> so you call an animation, which starts and takes time, then you fire something else.
[09:59:30] <repxl> duch_kazatel ah ok i trying to understand now how that works and ye that console rocks !  i can see it better now not just a object
[09:59:50] <repxl> duch_kazatel however i don't understand why it runs only 3 times http://jsfiddle.net/MP3uS/4/ if there are 4 short_name values
[09:59:54] <duch_kazatel> Ownix I'm terrible at explaining queueing and animations in jquery.  somebody else might be better suited to help you.
[09:59:55] <Fishy> Any ideas how to count the number of occurrences of a class in a table?
[10:00:09] <duch_kazatel> Fishy .length
[10:00:28] <duch_kazatel> repxl see the "2" to the right of the first result?
[10:00:33] <duch_kazatel> that means that result was duplicated.
[10:00:38] <duch_kazatel> it runs 4 times.
[10:01:05] <duch_kazatel> Fishy $('#myTable .className').length should do it.
[10:01:15] <repxl> duch_kazatel oh ok sry :D
[10:01:18] <Fishy> duch_kazatel: that was easier then expected
[10:01:25] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: so they are in queue so how can one not be waiting for the other to finish?
[10:01:36] <Ownix> isnt that the definition of a queue?
[10:01:39] <duch_kazatel> Fishy the jQuery object is "array-like", so you can even do stuff like $('#myTable .className')[2]
[10:01:54] <Fishy> duch_kazatel: thatnk you for the info
[10:02:14] <duch_kazatel> Ownix like I said, I'm bad at explaining it - it's not really a queue.
[10:03:07] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: fair enough. Do you have a suggested action I take? Should I avoid using these callbacks? Is there some way to say if(callback == not finished) { //do xyz} ?
[10:03:37] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you basically have to manually stop animations.  there may be a status, as well.
[10:04:12] <Ownix> that doesnt sound fun. Oh wait... the other animation is triggering before the first is not finished
[10:04:16] <Ownix> thats the problem isnt it?
[10:04:19] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[10:04:35] <Ownix> So its more or less a conflict of interest.
[10:04:39] <duch_kazatel> animations are not my forte at all because of shit like that.
[10:04:44] <Ownix> Maybe a finished boolean can help
[10:04:49] <Ownix> yeah its not fun
[10:05:10] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta - https://github.com/FelixNeutatz/2048_M-A-Star
[10:05:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you might appreciate that link as well.
[10:06:03] <decx> hacker news frontpage links are banned ^^
[10:06:12] <duch_kazatel> hhaha
[10:06:18] <duch_kazatel> finally got around to my morning scrub today.
[10:10:22] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'd still lose.
[10:18:09] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: what is the proper way to have callbacks and options? I cant get this code to work and I want to use the options that come with ainamte http://pastie.org/private/rwn8vhxmjahne4ha92375w
[10:22:15] <sky> http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/25/inside-a-secret-apple-room-where-iphone-software-was-born/
[10:22:18] <sky> oopsp
[10:27:01] <repxl> duch_kazatel huh what happend :D http://jsfiddle.net/vevB6/
[10:27:18] <repxl> duch_kazatel it do not appear inside the form .. just nothing happens even no refresh
[10:32:02] <duch_kazatel> sorry about that folks.
[10:32:05] <duch_kazatel> was away for a bit.
[10:32:34] <duch_kazatel> actual work got in the way.
[10:33:00] <Ownix> actual work lol
[10:33:06] <duch_kazatel> :D
[10:33:21] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: how do you know so much about jquery?
[10:33:29] <duch_kazatel> i work with it every day.
[10:33:33] <duch_kazatel> been a programmer for a few years.
[10:33:40] <duch_kazatel> and i have very strong google-fu
[10:34:00] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: what is google-fu?
[10:34:05] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: google fuck you?
[10:34:16] <duch_kazatel> it's like kung-fu, but google.
[10:35:22] <duch_kazatel> sometimes i forget method names or built-in object or whatever, so I'm good with using stuff like MDN and the API docs, too.
[10:36:39] <duch_kazatel> and finally: i'm in the middle of a jquery migration from 1.8.3 to 1.11.  You will learn a lot doing that.
[10:40:31] <Velveeta_> damnit duch, i have roughly an hour until the last 2 hours of my day are taken up in meetings, and you've most likely ended any hope i had of getting work done by posting me another 2048 clone :D
[10:41:01] <Velveeta_> oh wait, this is just an algorithm for beating it, huzzah!
[10:41:45] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta_ exactly!  you're free now!  go live!
[10:43:02] <JqueryInfo> hi all
[10:43:11] <duch_kazatel> goood morning.
[10:44:45] <JqueryInfo> Why when I call my page in ajax, ajax does not redisplay me the number of votes in my page called by ajax?
[10:45:30] <duch_kazatel> are you rewriting apart of the page?
[10:45:46] <duch_kazatel> or are you just calling $.ajax() ?
[10:45:48] <serin38> Does anyone if they figured fixed jQuery UI's touch capability as seen in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13808663/jquery-ui-slider-touch-drag-drop-support-on-mobile-devices?
[10:47:20] <repxl> duch_kazatel here ?
[10:47:28] <duch_kazatel> repxl am now, yeah.
[10:47:36] <repxl> duch_kazatel well but if my form is not refreshing how i can proccess the form on the php side :D ?
[10:47:56] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel:  in my page index.php this is where all his calling my ajax page
[10:48:01] <duch_kazatel> you have to submit the data somehow, repxl
[10:48:14] <repxl> duch_kazatel wooot ? D:
[10:48:28] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo php and javascript do not magially know about one another.
[10:48:41] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo when you call $.ajax(), you then have to do something with that data.
[10:48:51] <JqueryInfo> I am forced to refresh my page for my number I like is displayed
[10:49:14] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo could you share your ajax code?
[10:49:17] <duch_kazatel> in a jsfiddle?
[10:49:28] <JqueryInfo> yes duch_kazatel
[10:49:38] <JqueryInfo> http://pastebin.com/zGTnpKpL
[10:49:56] <duch_kazatel> jquery are you getting any console errors with this?
[10:50:07] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo i mean.
[10:50:28] <JqueryInfo> my error console : HorodatageÂ : 26/03/2014 18:46:58 ErreurÂ : Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'
[10:51:03] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo what line of your example has that error?
[10:51:22] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo err, I mean errors in your console on your page, not in the pastebin.,
[10:52:31] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel: it's just that ajax does not charge my data "like" that are stored in db
[10:52:52] <JqueryInfo> on index.php
[10:53:05] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo the php and javascript are separate things.
[10:53:12] <duch_kazatel> updating one does not magically update the other
[10:53:16] <duch_kazatel> you have to do that yourself.
[10:54:12] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel: but how ?
[10:54:20] <JqueryInfo> in php or in js ?
[10:54:32] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo in the success/done callback in your javascript, put your logic that updates stuff.
[10:54:43] <duch_kazatel> you are confused about the relationship between php and javascript.
[10:55:00] <duch_kazatel> php simply pumps content out to the browser.  the javascript acts on that content.
[10:55:21] <duch_kazatel> to get new stuff for javascript, you need to call php, which pumps out new stuff.
[10:56:20] <JqueryInfo> ok duch_kazatel : function afficher(data) ?
[10:56:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:56:50] <dan_j> Hi. With Select2 or Chosen selectbox replacements, can the height and width be altered?
[10:57:25] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/ - see line 14 ?
[10:57:30] <duch_kazatel> that's where your logic should go.
[10:59:04] <JqueryInfo> ok duch_kazatel  i see it
[10:59:19] <Velveeta_> duch is pretty good at magic
[10:59:29] <Velveeta_> he once grabbed the nose right off my face
[10:59:33] <duch_kazatel> nah.  i'm a hell of a guitarist though.
[10:59:40] <Velveeta_> and then separated his thumb right in front of me, it was crazy!
[11:03:38] <NicholasC> Silly question: I'm using $.post() to post some data to a page, which yields a file content-disposition:attachment. Is there any way to get that file back and if so, what's the proper way?
[11:05:21] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC not that i'm aware of.  you'd have to generate the URL and then do like an iframe or something
[11:05:39] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3499597/javascript-jquery-to-download-file-via-post-with-json-data
[11:05:42] <duch_kazatel> yep #nailedit.
[11:05:56] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, hm. Then I'll need to find some other solution. Damn.
[11:06:04] <duch_kazatel> did you see my solution?
[11:06:18] <NicholasC> I did, stumbled across it earlier, but it's not working :D
[11:06:24] <repxl> duch_kazatel i mean i append the data in the form but when the page no refresh the php no work than...
[11:06:26] <SimbaLion> Is it possible using jquery to control the behavior of a link based on whether a person taps once, or twice, on a mobile device? I was under the impression the behavior of tapping is dictated by the device alone.
[11:06:31] <JqueryInfo> i'm lost on this code duch_kazatel can you help me ?
[11:06:48] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion sort of, using timeouts and preventDefault()
[11:06:55] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, thanks anyway, I think I'll just go and iframe the whole thing.. somehow
[11:07:01] <duch_kazatel> repxl right - you have to submit it.
[11:07:08] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo what are you lost with.
[11:08:34] <repxl> duch_kazatel but it still no work because when i submit it the php runs above my form and than the jquery append data it's too late.
[11:08:35] <JqueryInfo> I'm not very good at js, I do what I know and the relationship php js beyond me
[11:09:06] <duch_kazatel> repxl "the php runs above my form" huh?  you should probably go read up on how forms in PHP works.
[11:09:23] <duch_kazatel> repxl you submit the form and php handles the form.
[11:09:28] <repxl> duch_kazatel action="" :)
[11:09:32] <duch_kazatel> repxl yep.
[11:09:35] <duch_kazatel> and method
[11:09:55] <SimbaLion> duch_kazatel, thank you.
[11:09:58] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo it's not "beyond" you.  pretty simple.
[11:10:01] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion of course.
[11:10:08] <repxl> duch_kazatel yes the php handles the form but when i use jquery to append more <input> it do not work ....
[11:10:23] <duch_kazatel> repxl you need to append your inputs to your form.
[11:10:35] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo PHP generates HTML.  Jquery acts on that generated HTML.
[11:10:43] <duch_kazatel> *javascript acts on that generated HTML.
[11:11:54] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo so when you make an ajax request, the php returns data of some kind.  you then take that data and act on it within javascript.
[11:12:56] <JqueryInfo> ok ok thank duch_kazatel, i put a function afficher in end of my code js ?
[11:13:08] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo I have no idea what that means.
[11:13:35] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo if you want to do something with the data returned via the ajax call, it needs to be inside the success handler.
[11:14:17] <repxl> duch_kazatal i do it in one button the firing up of the jquery and the php firing up
[11:14:27] <repxl> duch_kazatel .submit in jquery
[11:14:32] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel:  what ? my php in index.php ?
[11:14:34] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[11:14:38] <repxl> duch_kazatel and submit on php isset(blabla)
[11:15:14] <duch_kazatel> repxl no idea what that means.,  jsfiddle your html and javascript please.
[11:15:47] <repxl> duch_kazatel are you a bit familiar with php ? so i can put that too inside jsfiddle so you see what i mean
[11:15:48] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo if that doesn't make sense, then I'd start to go look up tutorials on javascript basics and php basics.
[11:15:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl nope.
[11:17:02] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel: no I did not say it, I just wanted to know how I should do to make it work
[11:17:28] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo huh?  did you look at the thing I pasted for you?
[11:18:36] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/1/
[11:18:43] <duch_kazatel> with a big old comment.
[11:19:19] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo in that success handler you put all your code that handles the data that comes back from your server.
[11:19:20] <Spami> Any idea why IE8 and IE9 would get stuck on 'error' here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2977d0de005df43c5e40 and IE 10 succeed ?
[11:19:28] <JqueryInfo> ok duch_kazatel  i had not seen excuse me
[11:20:07] <duch_kazatel> "get stuck"
[11:20:09] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel:  big thank i will do now
[11:20:11] <duch_kazatel> Spami define that pls
[11:20:53] <Spami> duch_kazatel, well on IE8/9 its always goes to error and on IE 10 it goes to success, I can't figure out why
[11:21:51] <Spami> duch_kazatel, the error is 'No Transport'
[11:22:08] <duch_kazatel> which version of jquery?
[11:23:35] <duch_kazatel> Spami aaaah that's right - CORS is done wrong in IE until 10.
[11:23:36] <shoky> Spami try including this https://rawgithub.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/master/src/xdr.js
[11:23:57] <duch_kazatel> try what shoky just shared :)
[11:24:36] <Spami> ah, those fuckers
[11:24:54] <duch_kazatel> lol they're not the only ones guilty of not following spec ;)
[11:26:39] <Spami> thanks shoky and duch_kazatel !
[11:27:35] <JqueryInfo> duch_kazatel: i'm lost i use append() ? or $(document).on('click', 'span.jaime', function() {
[11:28:07] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo huh?
[11:28:26] <duch_kazatel> JqueryInfo i don't know what your server is returning or what you're trying to do, sooo.
[11:28:38] <duch_kazatel> you should probably go read some basic jquery tutorials to get started.
[11:32:27] <Spami> holy shit, now i'm getting an access denied
[11:32:42] <duch_kazatel> Spami ?
[11:33:33] <Spami> google api is returning access denied on ie8 and not ie10
[11:37:26] <nhulea> hey so is windows xp version ie 6,7, & 8 different from other ie browsers ?
[11:37:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:37:55] <duch_kazatel> you mean is IE7 on XP different from IE7 on, say Vista?
[11:38:33] <nhulea> cause my code works in ie7  compadability mode win 7 but when I use browserstack to check it fails at a point that I wasnt expecting
[11:38:51] <duch_kazatel> are you using IE10's emulation?
[11:38:58] <duch_kazatel> because 11's is better iirc.
[11:39:06] <nhulea> for xp all 3 6  7 8
[11:39:34] <duch_kazatel> also: drop support for 6 and 7 unless you really feel the need to support them.
[11:39:52] <nhulea> I had ie 11 but now I reverted back to 9 thinking that would be more authentic experience
[11:39:57] <nhulea> for the js
[11:40:11] <nhulea> yeah see I think I might ahve to
[11:40:16] <nhulea> have to
[11:40:30] <nhulea> let me check my coed and see what particular is failing maybe I can just modify that
[11:40:40] <nhulea> to something more universal
[11:42:17] <nhulea> is there somethign out there that will check your js for ie compatability
[11:42:27] <nhulea> or is that just the browser
[11:42:58] <duch_kazatel> dunno, but knowing the line it's breaking on would be helpful.
[11:43:32] <nhulea> yeah I am actually not sure
[11:44:04] <nhulea> but I think I actually just found something that might be doing it
[11:44:09] <duch_kazatel> ?
[11:44:30] <nhulea> I might have found the error and it is could be vary simple
[11:44:34] <nhulea> very*
[11:44:37] <duch_kazatel> what's the error?>
[11:46:10] <nhulea> in my vars at the top I had this var _ten_ = instead of var _ten_;  it wasnt closed not sure how strict ie can be for that ?
[11:46:31] <nhulea> but it def looked pretty bad
[11:48:07] <esgee> Hey there folks... I'm having trouble running a jQuery image slider on my server and I'm hoping to find some help to figure out why it won't work
[11:49:06] <NicholasC> Alright, are you getting any errors through the console?
[11:49:15] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ esgee
[11:49:15] <b-ot> esgee: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:49:19] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:49:26] <NicholasC> That works too.
[11:49:57] <NicholasC> About my problem earlier, duch_kazatel: I gave it, added a div with a form in it, appended the stuff I needed to it as input fields and submitted that. Not as elegant as I had hoped, but still bleedin' fast.
[11:50:03] <NicholasC> gave in*
[11:50:16] <esgee> @NicholasC, no errors coming up
[11:50:37] <NicholasC> So what is it not doing? Do you have an example?
[11:50:58] <esgee> it was functioning properly on the designer's server
[11:51:03] <esgee> www.thainoodlesmadison.com
[11:51:05] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC meh, it works.
[11:51:24] <esgee> the images display, the but the transitions do not display now that the exact copy of the code is on my server
[11:51:34] <duch_kazatel> esgee do you have all dependencies?
[11:51:40] <NicholasC> Hah, a fellow Thai-focussed webber. I started my career with those :D
[11:51:57] <duch_kazatel> esgee wait did you pay somebody else to build this for you?
[11:52:27] <esgee> yes, yes I did duch_
[11:52:37] <duch_kazatel> esgee they need to fix that for you, then.
[11:52:41] <esgee> he seems to think it's a 'server side issue'
[11:53:05] <duch_kazatel> esgee do you have the right version of jquery?
[11:53:22] <esgee> it seems way out of date
[11:53:28] <duch_kazatel> your version?
[11:53:32] <duch_kazatel> what version is it?
[11:53:49] <esgee> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.6.3.min.js"></script>
[11:53:49] <esgee> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/coin-slider.js"></script>
[11:53:52] <dan_j> Is there a responsive select box replacement?
[11:54:05] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that is VERY out of date - what version did the designer use?
[11:54:17] <duch_kazatel> err, esgee
[11:54:22] <duch_kazatel> no es0 >.>
[11:54:22] <Es0teric> lol duch_kazatel
[11:54:25] <esgee> I mean, I have what he gave me
[11:54:25] <duch_kazatel> :D
[11:54:27] <esgee> : P
[11:54:34] <duch_kazatel> esgee okay, then he needs to troubleshoot it.
[11:54:37] <esgee> I don't know why he wouldn't use an up to date version (?)
[11:54:46] <duch_kazatel> esgee designrs aren't developers usually.
[11:54:51] <duch_kazatel> *designers
[11:54:55] <duch_kazatel> they just do stuff that works.
[11:55:03] <esgee> right,.. I'm supposed to be the 'developer' here
[11:55:07] <esgee> so I think I might need to fix this
[11:55:14] <duch_kazatel> esgee are you a developer by trade?
[11:55:35] <NicholasC> let's see what happens when we plug in 1.10
[11:55:50] <duch_kazatel> long story short, if the assets are all the same, it should work the same.
[11:56:08] <esgee> duch_ not really ... I try to do what I can, then beg borrow and steal to cover my deficits
[11:56:20] <esgee> I work with small businesses to help them with their web stuff at large
[11:56:39] <duch_kazatel> esgee then you're going to have a hell of a time.  either way - did they go any further other than it might be something about the server?
[11:56:54] <esgee> I'm talking with him on Skype now... here's his response:
[11:57:17] <esgee> [11:54:53 AM] A its fine on hyper6 but not on your site, which in turn means its gotta be something on your server
[11:57:18] <esgee> [11:54:57 AM] A and im no server tech, just a designer
[11:57:43] <NicholasC> That's pretty much the lamest excuse.
[11:57:52] <NicholasC> Can you give us the link on his server?
[11:57:52] <esgee> : (
[11:57:53] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make any sense.
[11:58:10] <duch_kazatel> did he send you a zip file of literally everything?
[11:58:12] <esgee> http://www.hyper6.com/clients/v2/ThaiNoodles
[11:58:26] <NicholasC> He's removed that if it's it: 404
[11:58:26] <esgee> it was there, but seems to have been taken down - @duch_kazatel, yeah
[11:58:29] <duch_kazatel> that's giving me a 404
[11:59:02] <duch_kazatel> esgee maybe it's an encoding problem.  what OS did they develop this on, and what OS is the server?
[11:59:45] <NicholasC> Bloody.. your designer's website takes ages to load :(
[11:59:49] <esgee> http://www.h6.cr/clients/v2/ThaiNoodles/
[11:59:57] <esgee> he changed servers ^ updated link
[12:00:35] <NicholasC> Ah hell, that animation is horrid.. let's see what's going wrong
[12:00:38] <esgee> I wish he would be more helpful about this, but he gave me a good deal and usually works for more so I guess he feels like it's not really his job to fix this
[12:00:51] <duch_kazatel> time to find a new person, then.
[12:00:59] <esgee> I can't really blame him. Probably, duch_
[12:01:09] <esgee> thanks by the way guys, you are all way helpful
[12:01:10] <duch_kazatel> if he's that flippant, it's not worth it.  you'll spend more money in the long run dealing with this.
[12:01:52] <esgee> hardly flippant- I just think this is beyond his skillset is all
[12:02:07] <esgee> whoever said something about it being a server OS issue - I'm betting that is the issue too
[12:02:13] <nhulea> weird it was a console.log() that was undefined ?
[12:02:47] <NicholasC> esgee, I do hope he didn't tell you he designed this specifically for you.
[12:03:35] <duch_kazatel> nhulea console.log() doesn't exist in old browsers unless the console was open.
[12:03:44] * Velveeta_ screams out "ha HA!" and then swings down on a rope with a knife clenched between his teeth, missing the deck and landing in the ocean, with only bubbles to mark where he landed.
[12:03:45] <duch_kazatel> esgee that was me.
[12:03:54] <dave_s> Anyone mind letting me know if this is total rubbish? https://github.com/thedavidscherer/bsNotify
[12:04:12] <duch_kazatel> esgee did you download the zip from an ftp server?  if so, did you download as binary?
[12:04:58] <esgee> @Nicholas... : / he did.
[12:05:06] <nhulea> hell yeah it worked  !
[12:05:22] <nhulea> wait then how did people debug code with no console ?
[12:05:32] <duch_kazatel> nhulea window.alert() ;)
[12:05:40] <nhulea> christ
[12:05:50] <nhulea> that sounds like it could be fun
[12:05:50] <duch_kazatel> nhulea before firebug, there was nothing, really.
[12:05:57] <nhulea> damn
[12:06:30] <esgee> ummm hmmm.... I don't think there was a binary file... it was an html.zip
[12:06:49] <duch_kazatel> esgee right, but when you download you have 2 options - download as binary or download as text.
[12:07:23] <stlstude> Does anyone know why using replaceWith is not retaining the rollover animation in this instance? I'm working on someone else's super janky code, so know that this isn't how I would have originally implemented rollovers! http://jsfiddle.net/9g7CN/
[12:07:24] <NicholasC> esgee, that's a plugin from 2010 made originally by some russian~
[12:07:36] <leosw> Hello world. I'm new to jquery. I want to do something like that :
[12:07:37] <leosw> $( "#overlay" ).not( "#content" ).stop().click(function() {
[12:07:47] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC I think esgee meant that the site was specially designed for him.
[12:07:50] <duch_kazatel> not the plugin.
[12:07:58] <NicholasC> Ah, right. The site's nice, midn you
[12:08:11] <leosw> To do something on #overlay click but not on #content, which is inclued in #overlay
[12:08:17] <esgee> ahaha yes- thank you duch_
[12:08:21] <NicholasC> the Plugin's just rubbish. You could rebuild it with one of the large selections of up-to-date plugins for JQuery
[12:08:24] <esgee> yes I agree! he's a very good designer
[12:08:37] <esgee> I think that's probably the move... shouldn't be too hard and it will be a good learning experience for me
[12:09:07] <duch_kazatel> leosw what's with the .stop() in there?/
[12:09:24] <NicholasC> leosw, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12652874/jquery-function-when-clicking-on-div-but-not-its-nested-div
[12:09:42] <leosw> duch_kazatel, Because there is many animations
[12:10:06] <Spami> Ho gosh, IE8 is such a pain
[12:10:07] <esgee> the good folks at Host Gator are taking a look for me for now...
[12:10:18] <esgee> When I DLed, I doubt I got the binary version
[12:10:19] <duch_kazatel> leosw - http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/10/
[12:10:41] <duch_kazatel> esgee the encoding it one potential problem.
[12:11:34] <esgee> @duch_ would you be able to lead me in the right direction of fixing that?
[12:11:44] <duch_kazatel> leosw http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/11/ for the actual example.
[12:12:16] <duch_kazatel> esgee i'd redownload the file as binary and go from there - use an actual FTP client and go from there.
[12:12:33] <esgee> used filezilla to upload
[12:12:58] <esgee> I've made a lot of changes to the site already too
[12:12:58] <duch_kazatel> what about the download?
[12:13:19] <duch_kazatel> esgee it's hidden characters - /r/n vs /n
[12:13:31] <NicholasC> Ah. wow. Oops.
[12:13:34] <esgee> shoot - that is concerning.
[12:13:53] <NicholasC> Common, but concerning. This is why repos are so damned handy.
[12:14:09] <duch_kazatel> esgee the way newlines are made between operating systems are different from windows to OS X / *nix based systems.
[12:14:16] <duch_kazatel> that might be part of your problem.
[12:14:23] <duch_kazatel> all right folks i gotta head out for lunch,  enjoy yourself.
[12:15:35] <esgee> sorry for my stupidity here duch_kazatel, but I'm not sure exactly how I should be downloading this. He sent me a link to the file in an email. ThaiNoodles/html.zip ... there aren't multiple options when I try saving it by going to that location
[12:16:51] <esgee> thanks for the help, duch
[12:17:52] <leosw> Thanks a lot, you solved my pb
[12:19:03] <orolo> i saw this way of having markup in the DOM but is hidden by a "type" (like script) that the DOM doesn't recognize so you can show it as needed. does anyone do this or know what that type of element would look like?
[12:25:30] <Jon47> orolo: I've seen this done with script tags, e.g. http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[12:25:32] <BillCriswell> orolo: Like a template tag?
[12:26:29] <orolo> that must be it (i'm still trying to figure out WHAT it was). but this  looks right. thanks Jon47 BillCriswell
[12:26:51] <Jon47> Are you writing a single-page app? generally you don't templates in the document, which is a fresh hit to the server every time you reload the page, when you could have them in a static resource that is cached..
[12:27:10] <orolo> ah yes, exactly this: Embedding scripts in your page that have a unknown content-type (such is the case here – the browser doesn’t know how to execute a text/html script) are simply ignored by the browser – and by search engines and screenreaders. I
[12:31:43] <orolo> Jon47, not a single page app; i was thinking of using it for an autocomplete list of li's; so, clone the one on the dom, add the data and values, show it and append it to the ul.
[12:36:47] <JqueryInfo> Cork:  hi can you help me ?
[12:39:46] <esgee> Hey all, I'm still struggling to resolve a small issue I'm having with an older version of jQuery and it not properly working with coin-slider.js
[12:39:53] <esgee> can anyone help me with this?
[12:40:36] <Jon47> orolo: since it's a template and by definition static, ideally you'd keep the definition in a static file, so a user could reload the page or navigate around and not have to download the same template each time; not a big deal but definitely something you should think about if you're trying to optimize performance
[12:42:29] <CrowX-> if I have set this "this.namebox         = document.querySelector(".name-box");"  can I make the DIV using that class disappear by calling "namebox.style.display = 'none';"?
[12:48:17] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: this.namebox.style.display = 'none';
[12:48:31] <CrowX-> BillCriswell, thanks
[12:48:51] <BillCriswell> You're in #jquery, for the record.
[12:49:40] <coder7of9> on the ipad i am setting focus onto an input field programmatically - this brings up the keyboard - however when i type no text is entered in the field.. if i manually select the field then the text which i type is entered in the field. is this a security feature or is there a way to focus, bring up the keyboard and then allow the user to type into the field?
[13:10:05] <mardukkk> http://pastebin.com/PRu9iTxz how come the mysqli_query is being run? when the other stuff isnt, before a change in the checkbox happens
[13:10:46] <duch_kazatel> mardukkk because the php is processed server-side before the page is rendered out to the browser.
[13:11:58] <duch_kazatel> mardukkk the javascript has no knowledge of your php, and vice versa.
[13:12:14] <mardukkk> okay. how would you suggest i do it? im a bit confused how to store these things
[13:12:25] <duch_kazatel> what exactly are you trying to do?
[13:12:26] <mardukkk> and thanks
[13:13:54] <mardukkk> duch_kazatel im trying to combine jquery with php.
[13:14:04] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make any sense.
[13:14:18] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to run something server-side with jquery?
[13:14:49] <mardukkk> no, it should check if the checkbox is changed and if it is, then it should update the database with php
[13:14:58] <mardukkk> and some info from the jquery
[13:14:59] <duch_kazatel> that's not possible.
[13:15:13] <duch_kazatel> you have to call a URL from jquery.
[13:15:48] <duch_kazatel> all PHP does is render stuff out to HTML.  all javascript does is run against rendered HTML.
[13:15:58] <duch_kazatel> they have know knowledge of one another.
[13:16:28] <duch_kazatel> *no
[13:17:10] <freebirD2> you guys, after I insert a piece of code into my website, the input validation, stops, what should I do ? How can I track down this kind of problem ?
[13:17:50] <freebirD2> have lots of jquery files in th esame file,
[13:18:04] <mardukkk> duch_kazatel you have any suggestions on what i should google for, to get a simple example
[13:18:34] <duch_kazatel> mardukkk if you want to save something to a database, you need to setup an endpoint in PHP you can hit that accepts a POST.  then POST to that endpoint using $.ajax()
[13:18:51] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 any errors in the console?
[13:19:52] <mardukkk> okay ill try, thanks
[13:19:57] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, not that I can see in my debian firefox 26
[13:20:12] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 okay.  then what did you add?
[13:20:25] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, I'll show oyu
[13:20:27] <freebirD2> 1 sec
[13:23:59] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 ask here - not in a PM.
[13:24:20] <freebirD2> I'll send you the user so you can login and see it ? may I /
[13:24:21] <freebirD2> ?
[13:24:27] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel,
[13:24:31] <duch_kazatel> i cannot take the time to do that.
[13:24:36] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[13:24:48] <duch_kazatel> it would be a good idea to setup a use case if possible.
[13:24:59] <duch_kazatel> that use case should demonstrate the problem.
[13:25:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.com is a good place to do that.
[13:26:30] <freebirD2> 1 login ? that would be 5 seconds
[13:27:11] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 let me clarify: For a variety of reasons, I feel very uncomfortable helping people when I need to log in to their site for them to show me the problem.
[13:27:49] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, I understand, no rpoblems, the issues shows up, after I insert this piece of code: http://pastebin.com/q45Kqzn5
[13:27:57] <freebirD2> issue
[13:28:17] <freebirD2> no matter where I insert the jquery part, my validation stops working
[13:28:30] <duch_kazatel> what validator are you using?
[13:28:59] <duch_kazatel> also: $(textbox).bind('change keyup', function() { - this is going to likely cause your problem.
[13:29:10] <duch_kazatel> stop through that function and see what all it's doing.
[13:29:28] <alaing> Hi I'm trying to grab the values of text fields and the text value of a selected <option>. Howver its outputting [object Object]
[13:29:31] <alaing> http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/CLmxq/
[13:30:11] <alaing> I think its from around line 15 where it all starts falling apart
[13:30:27] <alaing> http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/qDiyf/ works but its only text fields
[13:30:53] <duch_kazatel> alaing that means you're trying to output a complex object as a string.
[13:31:28] <freebirD2> duch_
[13:31:33] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, http://codetidy.com/8653/
[13:31:36] <freebirD2> validation line 285
[13:31:45] <freebirD2> going crazy alread, huge file
[13:32:04] <alaing> but why is it returning an object when my val() function is grabbing the .text() or .val() of the element
[13:32:31] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 dude really?  test case it.  i'm not going to help you until you get setup something basic on jsfiddle.com. I told you where your issue lies.
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> alaing let's look.
[13:33:20] <alaing> line 16 of http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/CLmxq/
[13:33:26] <freebirD2> you asked about the validator
[13:33:35] <freebirD2> I'm showing you the validator,
[13:33:58] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 I asked which one you were using, not for the entire contents of the page.
[13:34:08] <freebirD2> line 285
[13:34:10] <freebirD2> I told you
[13:34:28] <duch_kazatel> alaing running a console log of secondTDVal shows that it's returning an object
[13:34:30] <alaing> freebirD2: Dude, I agree with duch_kazatel you need an example
[13:34:58] <duch_kazatel> alaing thanks, but I can just ignore them :)
[13:35:04] <freebirD2> example of what ? I can't put the entire system inside fiddle
[13:35:08] <alaing> just cant figure out why though
[13:35:39] <zumba_addict> anyone here uses REST Sniffer?
[13:35:40] <alaing> freebirD2: we know that......but a test case is all we asking to be able to help you
[13:35:57] <duch_kazatel> alaing what, exactly, are you trying to do here?
[13:36:15] <alaing> create a readonly version of the table
[13:36:19] <NoiseEee> alaing: val() doesn't take a function.
[13:36:24] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee it can :)
[13:36:26] <alaing> it does
[13:36:29] <freebirD2> that's the problem friend, I've a entire system with many libs, and in one point, the validatoin stops, so tell me, how to put that inside jsfiddle ?
[13:36:30] <NoiseEee> oh blow me
[13:36:31] <NoiseEee> jk
[13:36:32] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/val/#val-functionindex--value
[13:36:33] <duch_kazatel> :D
[13:36:33] <NoiseEee> nr
[13:36:42] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 you need to create a test case.
[13:37:03] <freebirD2> that would require to put the entire system inside fiddle
[13:37:14] <freebirD2> because i don't know where th eerror is
[13:37:23] <duch_kazatel> alaing so you're trying to get the value of each field, right?
[13:38:19] <NoiseEee> freebirD2: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 should offer some tips on how to dig a bit deeper into whats happening
[13:38:25] <alaing> yes, I grab the label then move up the dom to the td level and then move to the next td, grab the input value or select lists display text
[13:38:36] <duch_kazatel> alaing mind if I try this a different way?
[13:38:38] <alaing> and then output a new table
[13:38:53] <alaing> duch_kazatel: sure just fork that demo
[13:39:57] <duch_kazatel> alaing can I modify the markup at all?
[13:40:33] <alaing> sure can
[13:40:40] <duch_kazatel> rad
[13:41:24] <alaing> although I might not be able to replicate that back into my system but happy to see what you suggest
[13:41:55] <duch_kazatel> i'll do it without modifying the markup then.
[13:42:05] <duch_kazatel> just looking at the given parameters :)
[13:42:05] <alaing> I know table based layout....naughty naughty :-D
[13:42:11] <duch_kazatel> nah it's fine.
[13:45:17] <alaing> odd if you add a console.log() before the return statement it outputs the value that i'm looking for
[13:45:44] <alaing> but the function seems to be returning the element as a jquery object
[13:47:07] <alaing> possible bug?
[13:47:46] <alaing> although thats in jquery 1.9.1 as well
[13:47:52] <duch_kazatel> nope.  scoping issue.  but i'm giving you a better way :)
[13:48:00] <freebirD2> NoiseEee, Tks, others in here pretend they help, but all they do is waste your time, and in the end, nothing
[13:48:56] <NoiseEee> freebirD2: look, its hard to offer help when all there is is code to look at, and a *lot* of it.  The best way of getting help is *reducing* your issue to something testable, and made an example of on a JS site like jsfiddle
[13:48:56] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 huh?
[13:49:32] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 i'm at work and can't dedicate a ton of time to parsing through a bunch of stuff.  sorry that my needing a paycheck offends you.
[13:51:19] <freebirD2> duch_kazatel, you asked like 3 questions, and said no in the end
[13:51:36] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 because you became rude.
[13:51:37] <freebirD2> I showed you a big file but gave you the line number
[13:53:30] <freebirD2> I mean, obviously some code in the new code, is making the validation stop, maybe I should replace $ for jquery, or something like this, no need for a full example in jsfidlle, sorry, that's my point,
[13:53:54] <NoiseEee> freebirD2: and your point is wrong
[13:54:04] <NoiseEee> freebirD2: it is impossible to debug code without a working sample
[13:54:28] <duch_kazatel> alaing sorry this took as long as it did - http://jsfiddle.net/bEH8P/3/
[13:54:29] <NoiseEee> freebirD2: so since you are the only one with a working sample, i've given you a link on how to debug. because you are the only person who can do it at this point.
[13:54:30] <freebirD2> I thought maybe it was some kind of common error
[13:54:35] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily clean, either, but this should help.
[13:54:56] <freebirD2> NoiseEee, I'll check the link, tks
[13:55:27] <duch_kazatel> freebirD2 in the future, insulting people is not how to get help.  i'm glad to help. Hell, I told you the exact line to start looking at for all your woes.
[13:56:47] <duch_kazatel> alaing this is also an option: http://jsfiddle.net/bEH8P/5/
[13:56:51] <alaing> duch_kazatel: Ah, thats pretty neat. look at it from a tr level
[13:56:57] <duch_kazatel> again, not the cleanest, but it goves you a starting point.
[13:57:00] <duch_kazatel> *gives
[13:57:08] <alaing> you do know you can chain the last statement
[13:57:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah, find the common container they share and go from there.
[13:57:10] <alaing> http://jsfiddle.net/bEH8P/4/
[13:57:19] <duch_kazatel> alaing yep, but I prefer not to.
[13:57:42] <alaing> the only thing that might be an issue is if there is to labels in a tr
[13:57:56] <alaing> why dont you prefer too?
[13:58:18] <duch_kazatel> just harder for me and my coworkers to read.
[13:58:50] <duch_kazatel> it's a great feature, sure, but not one I often use.  and that example is not for grace and speed.  just for functioning.
[13:59:12] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, any way to set your user's device on fire when they're using IE?
[13:59:18] <alaing> duch_kazatel: fair enough
[13:59:35] <duch_kazatel> if I were going for speed, I'd ditch the .each() and cache more.  i'd also do everything in a fragment and then append a little more than I do.
[13:59:42] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC I like IE 11 :)
[13:59:42] <alaing> duch_kazatel: thats not quiet what I was looking for with regards to the select list
[13:59:47] <alaing> just playing with the demo
[13:59:53] <duch_kazatel> alaing what are you looking for, then?
[14:00:00] <vipconsult> I have a form in a modal dialog . I submit via ajax for server side validation. I need: if form validation ok , reload current page , if validation fails load the php reposnse in the same modal dailog  .
[14:00:13] <vipconsult> I ame up with this , but it is not very elegant
[14:00:14] <vipconsult> success:function(result){                          if(result.search("errorValidation")>0) {                             //$($id).css("background-image", "default");                             $($id).html(result);                             $($id).colorbox.resize();                         }                         else {                               location.reload();                          }                       
[14:00:17] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, it's hung on me 6 times so far for testing this application for no discernible reason. IE 11 that is
[14:00:19] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ vipconsult
[14:00:19] <b-ot> vipconsult: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:00:32] <vipconsult> ok
[14:00:42] <alaing> duch_kazatel: still works : http://jsfiddle.net/bEH8P/6/
[14:00:54] <alaing> grab the select list options text not value
[14:01:16] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  fair enough.
[14:01:20] <vipconsult> what is a good practise to read the reposnse ? I guess if it fails I can set the headers via php and then jquery read the header if ok reload page ...
[14:01:35] <duch_kazatel> vipconsult use the appropriate callbacks.
[14:01:45] <duch_kazatel> .done() vs .fail()
[14:01:54] <duch_kazatel> or success and error, if you're using those.
[14:01:57] <alaing> duch_kazatel: thanks mate....
[14:02:08] <duch_kazatel> alaing of course - the idea a little clearer now?
[14:02:09] <alaing> any one here attending jquery uk conf this year?
[14:02:47] <alaing> duch_kazatel: yeah just not sure why my method wasn't working
[14:03:21] <alaing> duch_kazatel: are you on twitter?
[14:04:45] <vipconsult> duch_kazatel : and I need to set some fail header in php if the validation fails right ?
[14:05:40] <NoiseEee> vipconsult: personally, i think "fail" should be used for true server failures
[14:05:54] <NoiseEee> vipconsult: if you're talking about the app refusing validation, pass that back as part of the response
[14:06:17] <NoiseEee> ie:  {"result":"fail", "failMessage":"Failed Validation"}
[14:06:37] <NoiseEee> the xhr call itself succeeded; your app/login issued a fail
[14:16:23] <duch_kazatel> alaing yep.
[14:16:32] <duch_kazatel> woo hotfixes!
[14:16:34] <vipconsult> NoiseEee : that means I need to use json right and I need to modify the php form as it now return pure html
[14:17:33] <blindMoe> can anyone recommend a newer alternative to $.scrollTo()?  I like Scroll To but I am wondering if anyone has come up with anything newer in the past 7 years
[14:18:12] <alaing> duch_kazatel: all working :-)
[14:18:16] <duch_kazatel> woop!
[14:18:28] <duch_kazatel> Blacksheep a newer alternative to scrollTo()?
[14:18:32] <duch_kazatel> isn't that a jquery function?
[14:18:59] <blindMoe> well jQuery has $.scrollTo() but there is also a scrollTo plugin that adds some extra features
[14:19:52] <blindMoe> actually maybe jquery doesn't have $.scrollTo() .. don't see it in the docs
[14:19:56] <NoiseEee> vipconsult: correct. always use json as a response anyways, throw the html in
[14:20:26] <duch_kazatel> i'm thinking of .scroll()
[14:20:27] <duch_kazatel> derp
[14:21:47] <blindMoe> guess I will just stick with .scrollTo or waypoints
[14:24:49] <Sherbert> How would I debug for conflicting jquery scripts? (triggering one breaks the other)
[14:25:25] <NoiseEee> what do you mean by conflicting jquery scripts?
[14:29:19] <Sherbert> NoiseEee: Well, I'm trying to implement an expander script (http://plugins.gravitysign.com/colio/index_white.html)  into Drupal. I have the expanding part working just fine, but as soon as I add any type of slider inside of my expanding content, it will just show 1 picture
[14:29:37] <Sherbert> It's not just flexslider that's affected, various other jquery sliders I've tested give me the same result
[14:31:44] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your initialization is off.
[14:32:33] <Sherbert> How can I check for that? ( I can provide my current full output)
[14:32:42] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it?
[14:38:40] <repxxl> can anyone say me why when i moved my if(rdy == true) to another place it now returns allways false i mean all that is above the if(rdy == true) is proccessed FIRST or does the jquery logic goes not from top to bottom . http://pastebin.com/MGAHdj1L
[14:38:47] <repxxl> eeerrr js i mean
[14:39:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:39:13] <duch_kazatel> oh, easy
[14:39:30] <duch_kazatel> AJAX is short for "Asynchronous Javascript And XML"
[14:39:50] <duch_kazatel> just because code appears after an ajax call does not mean the script waits for the ajax call to complete.
[14:39:58] <Sherbert> duch_kazatel: somewhat cleaned up jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/5XS9E/
[14:40:06] <duch_kazatel> instead, it fires off the request and keeps going.
[14:40:21] <duch_kazatel> repxxl so anything that relies on the ajax call to complete should go in the success callback.
[14:40:37] <acidjazz> ur moms a request
[14:40:38] <acidjazz> that i fire
[14:40:48] <acidjazz> she relies on my call
[14:40:48] <repxxl> duch_kazatel hmm k  i will try another way
[14:40:49] <duch_kazatel> Sherbert woah can you take this down to just a simplse use case?
[14:41:30] <Sherbert> duch_kazatel: in its simplest form, it works, but as soon as I implement it it doesn't. I already stripped it somewhat. I'll try if I can clean it up further
[14:42:33] <repxxl> duch_kazatel you can ajax put a parameter to work synchron not async .. right ?
[14:42:37] <duch_kazatel> Sherbert eh, i wouldn't waste the time - basically, what I meant is that you're probably initializing the gallery before something exists.
[14:42:45] <duch_kazatel> r
[14:43:18] <duch_kazatel> repxxl you can, but it won't be supported much longer.
[14:43:25] <duch_kazatel> repxxl so you should learn to use the callbacks instead.
[14:44:42] <Sherbert> if that is the case, how would I go about fixing that?  Because basically the entire thing just messes about with display:none, rather than actually destroying/calling stuff
[14:44:51] <repxxl> duch_kazatel why they involved a synchro option i mean this is not healthy for ajax since it stands fro async ... :/
[14:44:58] <Sherbert> Also, adding a slider to the page but outside of the opening content will work somehow :(
[14:45:24] <duch_kazatel> Sherbert aaah, because the slider is calculating things for you that break because of the way the css is getting mucked with.
[14:45:53] <duch_kazatel> repxxl huh?
[14:47:32] <Sherbert> duch_kazatel: To prevent too much meddling, the slider doesn't actually autoplay, shouldn't that fix things? After all, it can only be moved back/forward when the content is already open
[14:48:09] <duch_kazatel> Sherbert probably not, because it's about the base values it's calculating.
[14:48:11] <duch_kazatel> that's my guess.
[14:48:36] <duch_kazatel> you could always wait to init the sliders until after content has opened/.
[14:49:12] <Sherbert> That seems to be what the example does  ( onContent: function(content){ 						// init "flexslider" plugin 						$('.flexslider', content).flexslider({slideshow: false, animationSpeed: 300}); 					}  )
[14:49:26] <Sherbert> However, adding that code to my implementation resulted in being unable to even open my items
[14:49:28] <duch_kazatel> AFTER the expand animation completes?
[14:49:59] <Sherbert> http://plugins.gravitysign.com/colio/index_white.html   Line 62 of the source code
[14:50:46] <duch_kazatel> Sherbert I don't knopw that the "onContent" callback is for.
[14:51:09] <Sherbert> onContent appears to fire whenever I click on a link that "opens" that slide thing
[14:51:23] <Sherbert> so in that demo, it would be clicking view project links
[14:51:25] <duch_kazatel> is that an animation?
[14:51:40] <duch_kazatel> because you want to wait until the animation completes.
[14:52:33] <Sherbert> I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that
[14:52:56] <duch_kazatel> onContent fires when you click the link that opens the slider thing, right?
[14:53:25] <Sherbert> yes
[14:53:46] <duch_kazatel> right - you need the animation to finish first.
[14:53:57] <duch_kazatel> it slides open - you're getting the state of things when the animation starts.
[14:54:55] <Sherbert> that makes sense, but I don't see a delay of any sort in the demo source
[14:55:10] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:55:29] <duch_kazatel> oh, you mean you can't see a way to delay it.
[14:55:35] <Sherbert> Well, if you have to wait for the animation to finish before you initialize something else, why is there no such thing in that demo (at least as far as I can see)
[14:55:43] <Sherbert> Because the demo employs flexslider
[14:55:57] <duch_kazatel> and that works fine?
[14:56:49] <Sherbert> The demo page I showed you works fine, I have the plugin downloaded, and locally it works fine as well
[14:56:58] <Sherbert> It isn't until I try to combine it with drupal that things go wrong
[14:57:19] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  hrm.  i hear lots of problems with drupal.  no idea what the fix might be.
[14:57:34] <Sherbert> The open/close part works just fine in Drupal
[14:57:45] <Sherbert> but adding anything "inside" the opened content that uses jquery just kills it
[14:58:08] <duch_kazatel> "that uses jquery" huh?
[14:58:21] <Sherbert> Well, I've tried to implement flexslider for instance
[14:58:49] <Sherbert> and various other sliders which normally work great
[14:59:09] <duch_kazatel> but you said one of those examples uses a slider no problem?
[15:00:01] <Sherbert> The example does yes, but it doesn't use drupal, so it's basically coded optimally for the example
[15:00:17] <duch_kazatel> drupal is just a cms, isn't it? that part shouldn't matter.
[15:00:22] <Sherbert> Yea that's wht I thought
[15:00:44] <Sherbert> You sure you don't want me to tear down that output further? Might give some insight as to what could be wrong
[15:01:13] <duch_kazatel> i don't really have time atm.  feel free to, but as long as you're delivering assets in the right order and following the example, you should be fine.
[15:01:58] <Sherbert> I think the order might be what's problematic
[15:02:06] <Sherbert> but I dont know how to change it
[15:02:15] <Sherbert> As for the actual output, I can match the exact demo
[15:02:20] <duch_kazatel> then do that.
[16:37:47] <JqueryHelp> Cork: hi please help me ?
[16:38:20] <JqueryHelp> i need help for my code like
[16:38:36] <JqueryHelp> shoky:  hi please help me ?
[16:44:15] <JqueryHelp> i need help
[16:46:46] <Gege> hi
[16:47:46] <BillCriswell> JqueryHelp: Just ask.
[16:48:13] <JqueryHelp> BillCriswell:  ok
[16:48:28] <BillCriswell> Just ask flat out, no reason to ask to ask and ask specific people.
[16:50:14] <JqueryHelp> I remember when my page load ajax does not redisplay my php. php is loaded when I get on the site but when I change the page with ajax, and I come back to the page with ajax then there are the more I love
[16:50:43] <JqueryHelp> BillCriswell:  I do not know the function code in question
[16:53:12] <BillCriswell> JqueryHelp: I don't know what you're asking.
[16:54:43] <JqueryHelp> when my site loads, it shows me all the php, if I change my page and I go back to the page using ajax, given my php / mysql are lost BillCriswell
[16:54:53] <JqueryHelp> http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[16:55:35] <SimbaLion> I need a really simple question answered, I'm trying to implement this plugin http://osvaldas.info/drop-down-navigation-responsive-and-touch-friendly and at the very end it says the plugin should only be applied to parent links, and gives a line of code. But where do I put that line of code?
[16:59:40] <repxl> when i want a autocomplete input the values need to be stored into the database right ?
[16:59:57] <BillCriswell> SimbaLion: Anytime after the element is available.
[17:00:15] <SimbaLion> What I mean is, does it go in the html?
[17:00:57] <BillCriswell> SimbaLion: Yes, or an external JS file.
[17:00:58] <jphase> repxl: autocompletion plugins (not the autocomplete from your browser) can usually be configured to have an array of values as well if you wanted to hard code them. They wouldn't be dynamic at that point.
[17:01:12] <SimbaLion> Ah I see, and I can see it in the demo site's code, thank you for your help
[17:01:40] <BillCriswell> SimbaLion: No problem.
[17:02:20] <repxl> jphase like not save the words into db but in a array ?
[17:03:11] <jphase> repxl: well "saving" somewhat implies a database, I'm just saying the values can be pulled from an API somewhere, or from a javascript array as well.
[17:03:38] <SimbaLion> Another question this one maybe a little less newb, in the .html there is this 	$( function(), but when I "view source" on the rendered page it displays instead as $( document ).ready(function() {, can someone explain what's happening there? I don't see the same result in the source for the demo site..
[17:04:57] <bleathem> Velveeta: another jquery UI question for you (or anyone else really)
[17:06:14] <bleathem> Why doesn't the widget factory use a _disable/_enable callback mechanism to be consistent with the _create/_destroy approach?
[17:06:19] <SimbaLion> nevermind I figured it out, there was an unclosed function call immediately following
[17:09:20] <JqueryHelp> in my page ajax, i have a button like, if change page for load a new page ajax and return on first page, my php lost BillCriswell
[17:09:46] <BillCriswell> SimbaLion: They're the same thing basically. $(function(){ }) and $(document).ready(function(){ }); are essentially the same thing.
[17:10:10] <SimbaLion> I see, thank you. I have a lot to learn still about js and jquery :)
[17:11:15] <Velveeta> bleathem: because they're meant to be publicly accessible
[17:11:31] <BillCriswell> JqueryHelp: You would need to handle that with different urls.
[17:11:41] <Velveeta> or are you asking why they don't include _disable/_enable along with public functions that chain through to them internally?
[17:11:56] <bleathem> yes, the latter
[17:12:28] <BillCriswell> JqueryHelp: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/ take a look at this. See how the url changes and adds #foo
[17:12:59] <Velveeta> that i'm not sure of... and even the disabled state itself, which can be set via the option method, isn't a true option, it has a hack in place specifically for the "disabled" option, which just sets classes as appropriate
[17:38:54] <JqueryHelp> BillCriswell:  no it is not different url it's just different js file and different file php
[17:53:54] <freebirD2> you guys, I've this select filter jquery, and works fine, the problem is that before a I filter, the disable in the option works fine (not clickable), after the filtering, returns options clickable, how do I achieve that please ?
[17:53:56] <freebirD2> http://pastebin.com/tHRwJiPi
[17:54:17] <freebirD2> I'm pretty much sure this is going on in here:     $('<option>').text(option.text).val(option.value)
[17:54:40] <freebirD2> I would need to verify if it's a disabled input, and add a disabled in there, not sure
[17:55:32] <aitiba> hi
[17:56:19] <freebirD2> hi
[18:02:41] <Velveeta> oh time warner, your shenanigans never fail to annoy
[18:02:56] <Velveeta> we're currently getting 0.80mbps downstream.. on the 50mbps pipe that we pay for
[18:03:21] <jphase> yikes
[18:03:34] <Velveeta> yikes indeed, and this isn't even an isolated incident
[18:03:34] <tw2113> ever find it ironic that other countries get the faster internet to more blocked sites and we get the slow internet to most anything, Velveeta ?
[18:04:02] <Velveeta> tw2113: i don't think about their blocked sites, just about the fact that they get up to 100gbps for something like $20/mo
[18:04:46] <tw2113> granted we're starting too look at other country's monitoring/blocking as a guidebook here?which is scary
[18:04:58] <Velveeta> indeed
[18:05:35] <Velveeta> did you see that at&t's ceo lashed out at netflix's last week because netflix said the fcc needed to revisit its stance on net neutrality?
[18:07:30] <tw2113> nope
[18:08:01] <tw2113> sadly the people in power weren't prepared for the internet and what it'd become, and are in a position where they can do something about it
[18:08:25] <tw2113> *cough* washington dc *hack hoot*
[18:12:35] <Velveeta> obama's comin fer are internet guns
[18:21:26] <Velveeta> stupid interwebz
[18:22:46] <Velveeta> lemme axe you all a queshun
[18:23:19] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Hoap we've antsas
[18:23:30] <Velveeta> i guess first, by show of hands (i can't see your hands), how many of you attend some form of front-end engineering/javascripty conference at least once a year
[18:24:14] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I do not... but I never really looked into them either.
[18:24:48] <Velveeta> because i keep finding out about them long after they've been announced, when they're either sold out, or the "early bird" tickets are sold out or whatever
[18:25:06] <Velveeta> and it's not like i don't search for them... i just don't know how people search for them properly, apparently
[18:25:27] <Velveeta> there's gotta be some central repository of conference listings somewhere that make it easy to spot all the ones you want to attend in a given year, or at least quarter
[18:25:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Never even thought about it... seems like it'd be a useful website haha.
[18:26:07] <BillCriswell> Not sure how to aggregate all it....
[18:26:20] <Velveeta> i just found out about FEOC yesterday (F-E Ops Con), and both early bird and regular registration are sold out, only the 'last minute' category for $499 is left
[18:26:27] <BillCriswell> Since we can't find it... but fuck it. They can come to you!
[18:26:51] <Velveeta> and even traditional ones i knows the names of, to be able to search for them, don't always yield anything fruitful
[18:27:12] <BillCriswell> dosomethingnerdytonight.com
[18:27:40] <Velveeta> i tried searching for txdevfest recently, which google hosted here in austin last year, no listings for 2014... txjs, which is an annual event, doesn't seem to have any info on a 2014 event yet
[18:28:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: It seems like it would be a really useful site.
[18:28:50] <Velveeta> a google search for: front end engineering conferences, yields a top page of worthless results
[18:28:54] <Velveeta> yeah it does
[18:29:17] <Velveeta> there's only one page that looks relevant really, from lanyrd.com, and when you click through to it, it's a garbage page
[18:29:35] <BillCriswell> You figure it's something that would be super organized.
[18:29:59] <BillCriswell> "tech events" seems like a relative search term?
[18:30:05] <Velveeta> actually, this page looks promising: http://lanyrd.com/topics/javascript/
[18:30:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Niice.
[18:31:06] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://2014.phillytechweek.com/events#filter=track:dev&date=2014-04-04 For techweek we have a pretty sweet website!
[18:31:09] <Velveeta> annnnnd bookmarked so i never have to hunt for it again
[18:31:25] <Velveeta> are you from philly, i'm guessing?
[18:31:28] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:31:44] <BillCriswell> Linear events presented in a masonry format is odd to me... but whatever.
[18:32:24] <Velveeta> lol
[18:32:25] <BillCriswell> I bet I could eat for free this whole week.
[18:33:20] <Velveeta> oh boy, this looks like it could be a fun topic: http://lanyrd.com/2014/yldworkshops/
[18:33:50] <BillCriswell> 2 speakers, 2 attendees
[18:36:46] <Velveeta> just passed a chicago event on to our chicago people... still hunting for a texas-based one :D
[18:38:37] <Velveeta> http://futureinsightslive.com/las-vegas-2014/schedule/ ... close enough to texas :D
[18:39:16] <BillCriswell> Nice looking site.
[18:40:41] <Velveeta> oh, there's a css dev conf in new orleans, that's close enough that i could drive it
[18:40:42] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://www.meetup.com/ seems like it does a good job of keeping many of them organized.
[18:40:48] <Velveeta> and featuring chris coyier, we all love him
[18:40:56] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[18:41:12] <BillCriswell> Maybe not big ones... but general meetups
[18:41:20] <BillCriswell> It's funny, the ONE i do go to isn't listed here.
[18:42:37] <Velveeta> oh yeah, well i'm signed onto a few different meetups, i thought you meant actual conferences :)
[18:42:49] <Velveeta> my company is actually hosting an angular meeting right this second i think
[18:44:32] <Velveeta> i may try to get in on that css dev conf, js is a huge strength of mine, and i'm pretty good with css, but could certainly be stronger, especially as css3 support continues to improve
[18:45:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I hear that... I learned something really useful with CSS today.
[18:46:04] <Velveeta> oh yeah? like what?
[18:47:17] <BillCriswell> When you use a percentage for top and bottom padding on an element it's based on the width.
[18:47:40] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/lizopahu/10/edit This padding-bottom: 40%; was extremely useful to me.
[18:48:10] <BillCriswell> It beats resetting the height on the container on browser resize.
[18:48:21] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i remember dave rupert using a trick like that to make embedded youtube videos responsive
[18:48:42] <Velveeta> gave them a padding of 50% so they'd scale proportionally with the browser window i think
[18:49:19] <Velveeta> i have another awesome css nugget for you, that was discovered by one of our devs a few months back
[18:49:24] <Velveeta> i'm sure you're familiar w/ css expressions?
[18:49:29] <BillCriswell> Lay it on me.
[18:49:29] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:49:34] <BillCriswell> Oh shit. Netsplit.
[18:49:43] <Velveeta> and how they're naughty because they're such expensive operations?
[18:49:51] <Velveeta> and they they reevaluate themselves nearly friggin constantly
[18:49:51] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:50:17] <Velveeta> he found a method of implementing single-instance expressions, that evaluate themselves once and overwrite the expression value
[18:50:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That is interesting.
[18:50:48] <Velveeta> like so: http://vacskamati.blogspot.com/2008/10/one-time-execution-of-ie-css.html
[18:54:23] <BillCriswell> Luckily I never needed to do this, but it's good to know I can do it not crappily.
[18:54:43] <Velveeta> yeah, we actually did have need of doing it once or twice, and it was good to know that this type of method was available
[18:55:06] <Velveeta> it's not a live-updating kind of thing because it only evaluates once, but it will solve the majority of problems i would imagine..
[18:55:18] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[18:55:44] <Velveeta> like the inherit example they used would only inherit the parent color at the time it loaded, and if js changed the parent color, would then be out of sync, but still.... don't do that stuff
[18:56:17] <BillCriswell> Absolutely.
[18:56:49] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: This is what I was tempted to use the transparent 1x1 gif for if you remember that from earlier.
[18:57:15] <Velveeta> i don't remember that, was it from tonight? because i haven't been paying a whole lot of attention tonight :)
[18:57:45] <BillCriswell> No way earlier today. Maybe it wasn't you.
[18:59:04] <Velveeta> yeah probably not, i was swamped with meetings today
[19:39:34] <amigojapan> hi, again, I am new to jquery... I am using draggable....  but when I drag a div to another place, it's top and left properties are empty.... I need to know the absolute position of the object, my code it a bit big, but here it is  http://amigojapan.duckdns.org/easypageeditor/edit.html
[19:41:06] <amigojapan> notice that when you click the text, I want ti to print out the potition, but the position is empty
[19:47:21] <LoneStar99> how would I parse through the following --> to get port numbers --> http://pastebin.com/PC7AgkM3
[19:52:12] <jphase> LoneStar99: use var whatever = $.parseJSON(thatstring);  and use $.each(whatever, function(index, value){ console.log($(this).port); });
[19:53:57] <tw2113> LoneStar99, http://jsbin.com/dexacutu/1/edit
[19:57:19] <amigojapan> ok, I figured it out :)
[19:59:53] <jphase> amigojapan: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/9nv7g/
[20:00:08] <jphase> whoops, a bit too late
[20:00:18] <Velveeta> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/8mu6f
[20:00:26] <amigojapan> thanks jphase I will take a look anyway
[20:00:32] <Velveeta> that's not anything.. i just felt left out of all the link posting...
[20:00:38] <LoneStar99> lol k thanks will take a look
[20:00:42] <jphase> lol
[20:00:57] <Velveeta> i just decremented each value in your own url
[20:01:08] <amigojapan> thanks jphase
[20:02:19] <jphase> hah, didn't notice that, that's even nerdier
[20:03:50] <jphase> amigojapan: åœŸäº•è¶³ã—ã¾ã—ã¦
[20:04:11] <amigojapan> jphase: ã¸ã¸ã¸ã€€ã©ã†ã‚‚
[20:07:59] <cjwelborn> ã‚¯ãƒªã‚¹ â† my name for real.
[20:08:47] <jphase> hi there chris ;)
[20:09:39] <cjwelborn> heh. pretty good.
[20:10:02] * jphase says in hick voice... "wahh tahshee no ã‚¸ã‚§ãƒ• sunnn"
[20:10:13] <jphase> woops
[20:10:21] <jphase> forgot the namae
[20:10:28] <jphase> and the wa
[20:10:45] <jphase> </gaikokujin>
[20:10:50] <LoneStar99> tw2113: thanks, that worked, just need to tweak my code,...
[20:18:27] <CiE> sup guys
[20:20:55] <jphase> yo
[20:21:01] <Velveeta> sup, fellow brogrammer
[20:21:36] <Velveeta> i came across this today, and coined the term bronygrammer: http://panzi.github.io/Browser-Ponies/
[20:51:18] <jphase> bah, it's way to early to have css problems :\
[21:36:00] <ManyouRisms> if you use .attr("disabled",true) to disable a button, can i target specifically a disabled button later using jquery object? like $(button[disabled="disabled"]) or something?
[21:36:17] <ManyouRisms> or do i have to do condition checking to see if its attr("disabled") returns true
[21:38:50] <jphase> ManyouRisms: yes you can
[21:39:12] <ManyouRisms> using the syntax i tried? [disabled="disabled"] >
[21:39:23] <ManyouRisms> i must be messing something else up then
[21:39:24] <jphase> $('button[disabled]') would be a short and sweet version that would support html5 attribute as well
[21:39:25] <ManyouRisms> thanks!
[21:45:37] <ManyouRisms> netsplits galore today
[21:47:07] <jphase> yeah, counted a few
[21:50:32] <ManyouRisms> ps, problem earlier was because turns out, there were more than one disabled buttons
[21:50:52] <ManyouRisms> so was throwing a warning more than an error
[22:12:52] <jphase> ManyouRisms: ahh gotcha. use my nick if you need my attention or my client won't ping me btw ;)
[22:14:26] <Velveeta> i should throw out that using .attr() to disable a button is the legacy way of doing things, you should be changing disabled state with .prop('disabled'), and you can check for disabled buttons with $('button:disabled'), which should check both the attribute and the data property
[22:14:34] <ManyouRisms> jphase: you gotter. i just got netbeans set up to work with my web stuff, it is fairly nice actually
[22:14:41] <ManyouRisms> liking it better than komodo
[22:14:55] <ManyouRisms> Velveeta: thanks
[22:15:02] <Velveeta> no problem
[22:15:14] <jphase> I'm a sublime person myself
[22:15:23] <ManyouRisms> I like sublime too
[22:15:23] <Velveeta> +1 for sublime
[22:15:33] <ManyouRisms> brackets is also nice
[22:15:37] <ManyouRisms> excited to try atom
[22:15:48] <jphase> downloaded Atom a week or two ago, seems okay but a bit far away from using it imo
[22:15:57] <Velveeta> i've seen buzz in the twitterverse about atom, but haven't tried it yet
[22:16:04] <jphase> and also I don't like things that take me out of my terminal for git control and such
[22:16:07] <Velveeta> but apparently some big names have already converted over to it
[22:16:36] <jphase> yeah, it's pretty much like a fancy cool version of sublime but isn't quite there yet
[22:16:53] <jphase> the one very nice thing is the file tree is colored based on changes in the repo since it's all gitcentric
[22:17:02] <ManyouRisms> for me, it's whatever you get used to. i like command completion netbeans provides because it has the little popup of the API that you need, which is good because i'm still fairly new to jQ
[22:17:09] <ManyouRisms> and my pocketguide is a whopping 4 oz
[22:17:15] <jphase> kinda neat to see how many green files I have to tell me I need to push my changes
[22:18:04] <ManyouRisms> haven't tried using sublime with git yet..
[22:18:40] <jphase> I don't use it "with" git per sÃ©, I still do 100% of my version control in the terminal
[22:18:56] <jphase> I like my IDE being strictly for code
[22:19:39] <ManyouRisms> ahh, just a nifty reminder when the filetree is green? i see
[22:19:58] <ManyouRisms> There's a pay version of sublime, no?
[22:20:21] <jphase> yeah
[22:20:42] <jphase> well there's more than that in atom, it's very similar to sublime so it's an easy transition
[22:20:53] <jphase> that's just the one "ooOOOoooo" factor for me personally
[22:21:12] <ManyouRisms> i tried to get an invite for it, nothing yet.
[22:21:17] <ManyouRisms> i won't cry about it
[22:22:38] <jphase> what's your email?
[22:23:17] <ManyouRisms> jezzah@gmail.com
[22:23:26] <jphase> sent
[22:23:35] <ManyouRisms> right on, thanks. how many invites did you get?
[22:23:50] <jphase> I only had 1 but I earned 2 since my last login apparently
[22:24:25] <jphase> looks like with each person you invite (if they accept) you get 2 more
[22:24:32] <ManyouRisms> well, you earned them, thats forsheezy.
[22:24:35] <ManyouRisms> sounds pyramid scheemy
[22:24:50] <jphase> hehe, well yeah it's definitely a roll out phase
[22:24:57] <jphase> they plan to make it paid when it launches
[22:25:18] <ManyouRisms> fair enough. I definitely don't mind paying for things if they work for me
[22:25:23] <jphase> same
[22:25:41] <jphase> developers that bitch about paying other developers for developing make me giggle
[22:27:16] <ManyouRisms> well, yeah. especially with the alternative being ads (for the most part).
[22:27:31] <Velveeta> i definitelt don't mind having my company pay for things if they work out for me ;)
[22:28:11] <jphase> hah, amen to that Velveeta
[22:28:29] <jphase> speaking of which, I still need reimbursement for these darn monitors...
[22:29:11] <Velveeta> i'm considering expensing a trip to css dev conf in new orleans under my tuition reimbursement
[22:29:14] <jphase> working across the country has it's down sides for sure, can't poke the accounting guy effectively over IM
[22:29:28] <jphase> when is that btw?
[22:29:36] <Velveeta> oct 13-15
[22:29:43] <jphase> hmmm
[22:30:38] <jphase> maybe I'll get the wiki kids to pay my way to that
[22:30:49] <jphase> been meaning to go to a jquery conference too but haven't had the time
[22:31:12] <jphase> well that's not true, I always forget to put them in my calendar
[22:32:07] <Velveeta> heheheh
[22:32:36] <Velveeta> the hardest part for me is just finding the damn conferences
[22:32:53] <ManyouRisms> i was gonna say, whats the best way of finding them
[22:32:58] <Velveeta> i bookmarked a page on lanyrd.com earlier that seemed promising
[22:33:02] <ManyouRisms> i've heard of a couple after they had come and gone
[22:33:06] <ManyouRisms> ie the recent toronto one
[22:33:17] <Velveeta> yeah, i always hear about them too late
[22:33:40] <Velveeta> like i heard about jsconf when it was sold out, submitted a proposal to present (and earn a free ticket) but it got rejected
[22:33:52] <jphase> :(
[22:34:12] <Velveeta> i heard of FEOC just yesterday, and it's been sold out of early bird and regular tickets already, only on the 'last minute' ones, which are too pricey
[22:34:55] <Velveeta> but this link was pretty helpful earlier, i recommend bookmarking it: http://lanyrd.com/topics/javascript/
[22:35:11] <Velveeta> they still list some toronto ones for 2014
[22:35:41] <Velveeta> well, *a* toronto one
[22:35:56] <Velveeta> and one in ottawa
[22:36:17] <ManyouRisms> bah. sask is too far away. i'll have to wait until i move
[22:37:06] <ManyouRisms> night guys
[22:37:23] <jphase> night
[22:37:54] <Velveeta> adios
[22:38:44] <jphase> neat site, definitely bookmarked
[22:39:04] <jphase> I now know all the conferences in my neck of the woods :D
[22:43:42] <Velveeta> :)
[22:43:51] <Velveeta> on that note, i'm out for the night
[22:44:11] <jphase> ciao cheesy
[22:52:26] <Besan> Hello everyone :)
[22:52:33] <Besan> I think i came to the right place
[22:56:37] <jphase> ?
[23:16:19] <Voyage_> why there is a need for callbacks in ajax calls? why not just use succes: do something , error: do some thing in normal way?
[23:16:47] <dylix> one does not simply ask why there are callbacks
[23:17:38] <Voyage_> dylix,  can you please explain?
[23:18:15] <dylix> not really, just playing devils advocate here :)
[23:19:24] <Voyage_> k
[23:36:59] <svector> Hello
[23:37:11] <svector> How do retrieve Objects from nodes?
[23:37:22] <svector> looks like .attr gets the string representation?
[23:37:49] <jphase> .prop
[23:50:03] <Voyage_> why use the first method and the call to it. (call back functions).  and why not use the last one? http://pastebin.ca/2683261
[23:50:16] <Voyage_> one method is using success: success    line 8 . and the caller of that method actually puts up the method on success (line 16)
[23:52:49] <svector> jphase, doc says .prop returns either  String or bool
[23:54:10] <jphase> sorry, didn't know you literally meant an object type svector, what's in your attribute exactly?
[23:54:48] <svector> some json object. I'm actually using jstree
[23:55:00] <jphase> .data would probably be your best bet
[23:55:06] <jphase> can't remember if you need to parse it or not
[23:55:06] <svector> I want to embed json data to nodes before creation
