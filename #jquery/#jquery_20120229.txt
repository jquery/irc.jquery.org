[00:03:55] <mindis|wurk> hurrr. how the heck can datepicker push other elements around when it's position: absolute
[00:04:29] <Cork> it can't
[00:04:38] <mindis|wurk> yet it does :P
[00:04:48] <Cork> then its not position absolute
[00:04:53] <mindis|wurk> but it is
[00:07:06] <mindis|wurk> it's in fact defined by datepickers own code, it forces absolute
[00:07:32] <Cork> mindis|wurk: do you have a link?
[00:08:18] <mindis|wurk> sorry, internal stuff
[00:10:02] <defendguin> how can i convery a json javascript object to a string for local storage?
[00:10:53] <Cork> JSON.stringify
[00:11:04] <defendguin> thanks!!
[00:11:10] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify({ obj:'test' })
[00:11:11] <bot-t> Cork: "{\"obj\":\"test\"}"
[00:15:30] <theBrettman> I wonder if fastfrag does that?
[00:26:37] <Xotix> is there anything wrong with $('#editor img').attr("src")?
[00:38:23] <beasty> mornings
[00:38:26] <tankBurger> Hi guys! I'm going to use a keyup/keypress function, on an <input> but I don't want them to trigger on anything but letters/numbers. What's the best way to ensure that I get these exceptions? I've tried with "e.each", and it works, but it seems a little dirty to just add every one of these keys in the IF
[00:39:02] <beasty> tankBurger: regex it
[00:39:27] <Xotix> what's wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/uLF7j/ i want to check if any image has no src defined and if so then replace it. But i fail at getting them correctly.
[00:40:08] <tankBurger> aha, thanks
[00:41:27] <Carlitta87> im not sure if this is the right place to ask, but i want to create a simple pager for a small content area but i cant find anything about it online
[00:41:29] <tankBurger> btw, when I said e.each, I meant of "e.which"...not that it matters but still :)
[00:42:17] <mindis|wurk> Xotix is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/uLF7j/1/
[00:44:16] <Xotix> mindis|wurk: â€¦ yes. how stupid :) thanks a lot
[00:44:27] <mindis|wurk> np
[00:52:02] <Navetz> hey guys. I'm using jqueryui and trying to do this but I don't know how  $('<div>TEST <input class="date-picker"></div>').datepicker().dialog();
[00:52:41] <Navetz> i know having .datepicker() before the .dialog doesn't make sense but I don't know how to load the date-picker script after so that it works after the dialog box pops up
[00:59:06] <Xotix> How can i get all img's from a variable containg some html? e.g. $(myVar img).foo();
[01:02:00] <Hooloovoo> Xotix: html as a string or as a jquery element?
[01:02:20] <Cork> $(myVar).find('img')
[01:02:55] <Hooloovoo> Cork: that'll only work if it's a element or a jquery element, right?
[01:03:01] <Hooloovoo> not if it's a html string
[01:03:03] <Cork> no
[01:03:15] <Cork> $(myVar) will parse the html to dom
[01:03:24] <Hooloovoo> ohh, that's pretty nice.
[01:03:52] <Cork> if theres no outer element it won't work though
[01:04:05] <Xotix> works thanks :).
[01:04:06] <Carlitta87> simple jager
[01:04:09] <Carlitta87> pager
[01:04:15] <Cork> $('<img><span></span><img>') needs to use .filter instead
[01:04:20] <Hooloovoo> might be better to attach it to another div first as a failsafe
[01:04:30] <Cork> not really
[01:04:45] <Cork> $() works grate
[01:04:54] <Hooloovoo> then it would find direct img childs too
[01:05:13] <Cork> the first isn't childs though
[01:05:15] <Cork> :)
[01:05:33] <Hooloovoo> in case myVar = "<img src='test'><div><img src='hehe'></div>"
[01:05:41] <Cork> but ya $('<div/>').append('<img><span></span><img>').find works
[01:05:42] <Hooloovoo> true
[01:07:59] <twoface> Navetz, there are a few things missing. First of all, you need to append the new <div> to your document for it to be visible. Second, you use .datepicker() on the div, and not on the input - which I guess is wrong.
[01:10:54] <Navetz> twoface, I thought that .dialog() would append that <div> to the document? I understand that the way I have it makes no sense but it would probably work if I could append it to the document, then call datepicker, then call the dialog function on the <div>
[01:13:05] <twoface> I don't recall .dialog() doing that magic, but I could be wrong. Anyway, you can do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/a6c6N/
[01:13:24] <twoface> expand or contract is wanted
[01:13:51] <twoface> right - removing document.append still works :)
[01:14:26] <Xotix> hmm, need further helpâ€¦I have a var, with some html as a string. There are some img's with an empty src path. I want to replace them and get back the whole string with that replaced img's. How do i do that? Doing it directly in the dom is no problem, but I don't get the trick doing it with an var.
[01:15:15] <twoface> Xotix, is it really necessary to have it as a string? if your variable is a jquery object, it would be the same as manipulating dom
[01:15:58] <Carlitta87> does anyone know a link i cud use to do sum "paging"?
[01:16:20] <Xotix> twoface i just got it, but it looks ugly. http://pastebin.com/JxrB0vDA
[01:16:45] <Carlitta87> please
[01:17:06] <tankBurger> Is this true? You can't get the actual key pressed in the when using the keyup/keypress function, you can only get the ascii code.
[01:17:14] <twoface> Xotix, $("img[src='']", content).attr('src', 'dummy.png');
[01:17:21] <tankBurger> if that's true, I actually think IE handles this better :P
[01:17:22] <Navetz> twoface, thanks a lot. I haven't got it working yet because I have a bug somewhere else but I'm on track now
[01:17:23] <twoface> i guess that would do the same
[01:18:07] <twoface> tankBurger, what would be the difference? you can't really save a "arrow up" or "esc" as a character :)
[01:18:31] <tankBurger> easier for me to filter the input, without knowing all the codes :(
[01:18:53] <twoface> all ascii codes are easily found on google
[01:19:00] <tankBurger> logic: is this number or charachter? yes -> then do something
[01:19:12] <tankBurger> yeah, but then I need a huge IF function
[01:19:23] <tankBurger> i was hoping for some clean regexp
[01:19:34] <Xotix> nope, twoface. This just returns me the img's. It returns what the selector selected, in this case, the img's. But i want to replace the mand get what i've passed. that's why i started with children() and later searched for the imgs.
[01:20:53] <twoface> tankBurger, what about /^([48-56]|[65-90]|[97-122])$/ might do it
[01:21:31] <tankBurger> aha, the ranges...ok, thanks, I'll give that a go :)
[01:21:47] <twoface> Xotix, then only use my example within your .children().each()
[01:22:06] <Xotix> twoface: i did that of course
[01:22:17] <tankBurger> I also found out that I could compare the input field with the old value vs the new and get the input by comparioson, but that seems a bit heavy
[01:22:41] <Xotix> thanks. how is selector called you made? using [src=''] in the selector?
[01:23:10] <twoface> what it is called? an attribute selector, i think
[01:24:27] <Carlitta87> need to do a simple paging item just for sum text...i cant find it online
[01:25:42] <Carlitta87> ppl not being helpful
[01:26:21] <twoface> right - nagging gets you helped faster :)

[01:28:27] <Narhir> My slide got broken, and I have no idea why, its wordpress website and it happend around the time when I was trying to do domain transfer: http://d22.d22-zone.us.positive-dedicated.net
[01:28:33] <Narhir> if someone could help it would be great
[01:28:56] <twoface> slide where?
[01:29:10] <Narhir> this "in the spotlight" section
[01:29:16] <twoface> besides, your code throws an error
[01:29:18] <Narhir> it should be like you click on 1 item it move to another
[01:29:24] <Narhir> well what can be caused by tis error.. ?
[01:29:29] <Narhir> it wasnt was like yesterday
[01:29:33] <Narhir> and then it showed up for no reason
[01:29:45] <twoface> theres always a reason
[01:29:57] <EdwardIII> hrm, for some reason this json response is triggering error on jQuery.get() rather than success? {"rank": "7"}
[01:30:00] <Cork> Narhir: most of the time your sending something other then jquery expect
[01:30:01] <EdwardIII> looks pretty valid to me!
[01:30:19] <theBrettman> how would I cache my json response?
[01:30:23] <Narhir> hmmm
[01:30:28] <Cork> EdwardIII: get doesn't even validate json
[01:30:31] <theBrettman> so that I can access it with any function
[01:30:42] <twoface> theBrettman, save it in a veriable
[01:31:06] <Narhir> so is there any way to fix it ? if I dont even know what caused an error ?;/
[01:31:08] <EdwardIII> Cork: i thought if it didn't receive JSON it returned a fail?
[01:31:12] <EdwardIII> returned/triggered
[01:31:16] <Cork> EdwardIII: nope
[01:31:21] <EdwardIII> raised perhaps might be the right word heh
[01:31:21] <Cork> it only handles plain text
[01:31:29] <Cork> so you can send broken json all you like
[01:31:43] <EdwardIII> hrm, the data object coming back has status: 200 and statusText: "OK"
[01:31:47] <varnie> good day.
[01:31:47] <Cork> EdwardIII: make sure you don't do something like xss or similar
[01:32:09] <Cork> EdwardIII: cause then the browser will block the data
[01:32:21] <Navetz> twoface, got it all figured out thanks
[01:32:56] <EdwardIII> Cork: it's all on the same domain name (localhost)
[01:33:03] <EdwardIII> Cork: https://gist.github.com/1939439 <- looks fine to me? this is the code
[01:33:05] <varnie> I have some href which invokes javascript:void(0) and (function($) {someStuffHere();})(jQuery); construction on that page, but it doesn't get executed. what did I wrong?
[01:33:21] <EdwardIII> Cork: and it's executing the code in the error block
[01:33:44] <Cork> EdwardIII: and no output in the error console?
[01:33:53] <EdwardIII> Cork: just pasting that now
[01:34:10] <varnie> if I put that js script simply as "$(function(){someStuffHere();}); it works.
[01:34:40] <twoface> varnie, please pastebin your code
[01:34:47] <Narhir> anyone interested in fixing this problem of mine for $$ ?
[01:34:57] <varnie> Okay, please wait a bit.
[01:35:06] <EdwardIII> Cork: here's the whole console output: https://gist.github.com/1939453
[01:36:20] <EdwardIII> Cork: so it's the xhr info, then it's the console.dir output for the data coming back in the error handler
[01:36:57] <Cork> EdwardIII: check the third argument
[01:36:59] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[01:37:05] <Cork> EdwardIII: (of error)
[01:37:06] <Double_Rainbow> i want to create a counter in Ajax
[01:37:10] <Cork> it should have the error object
[01:37:12] <Double_Rainbow> that counts from 1 - 10
[01:37:20] <Cork> might include something interesting
[01:37:24] <Double_Rainbow> and then updates the browser page dynamically
[01:37:27] <Double_Rainbow> any help ?
[01:37:56] <Cork> Double_Rainbow: you mean like 10 requests then update the page?
[01:37:56] <varnie> here jt js>
[01:37:59] <varnie> here it is*: http://jsfiddle.net/F4LLCON/wWSjX/
[01:38:06] <Cork> or just wait 10 secs then update?
[01:38:20] <EdwardIII> Cork: printed out the other 2 arguments passed into the error handler: https://gist.github.com/1939462
[01:38:55] <Cork> unexpected_tocken....
[01:39:08] <EdwardIII> Cork: https://gist.github.com/1939467
[01:39:15] <Double_Rainbow> Cork: no, i have a loop that counts from 1 - 10, then each time the number increments, the user sees it on its page, without refreshing his browser
[01:39:29] <Double_Rainbow> is that possible ?
[01:39:41] <Cork> Double_Rainbow: you mean a loop on the server side?
[01:40:30] <Double_Rainbow> Cork: ya
[01:40:34] <Cork> no its not
[01:40:39] <varnie> twoface, clicking the link doesn't work this way.
[01:40:50] <Cork> you can only send one update at a time through an ajax connection
[01:41:09] <Double_Rainbow> Cork: what?
[01:41:16] <EdwardIII> he could do it the other way though couldn't he? use websockets and push the data?
[01:41:34] <EdwardIII> node.js + comet + js  = party!?
[01:41:43] <Cork> EdwardIII: hmm wait a min
[01:41:47] * dualcore parties
[01:41:57] <Cork> EdwardIII: what mimetype does the stream have?
[01:41:58] <EdwardIII> although to be honest that doesn't sound like a real application, print 1-10?
[01:42:03] <Cork> application/json?
[01:42:24] <EdwardIII> Cork: application/javascript
[01:42:27] <Double_Rainbow> Cork: i cannot do a simple countdown with PHP/ajax ?
[01:42:30] <EdwardIII> i'm guessing that should actually be application/json?
[01:42:50] <EdwardIII> Cork: damn, that's exactly it heh
[01:42:52] <EdwardIII> Cork: thanks!
[01:42:56] <Cork> :)
[01:43:43] <EdwardIII> i guess you'd want javascript if it was jsonp
[01:43:48] <varnie> so, here're two code snippets, the first doesn't work, while the 2nd works: http://jsfiddle.net/wWSjX/4/ and http://jsfiddle.net/wWSjX/5/
[01:43:51] <Cork> ya
[01:44:06] <Cork> but then it would have to be wrapped in a function
[01:45:01] <Cork> varnie: (function($) {})(jQuery); is a plugin wrapper
[01:45:05] <Cork> its not what you want
[01:45:30] <Cork> varnie: it only create a scope where it garantees that $ is jQuery
[01:45:45] <Cork> $(function() {}); is an event listner
[01:45:51] <varnie> I see.
[01:45:57] <Cork> it waits for when the dom has loaded completly
[01:46:20] <Cork> if you want to garantee the $ use jQuery(function($) {});
[01:46:45] <varnie> thank you
[01:46:51] <Cork> np
[01:49:57] <theBrettman> ajax has an option where you can set cache: false; but what is this cache and how do i access it?
[01:50:06] <theBrettman> I need to know more about it so I can use it
[01:50:08] <Murugaratham> ajaxSetup
[01:50:34] <Murugaratham> $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
[01:50:41] <Cork> theBrettman: it doesn't
[01:50:52] <Cork> cache: true means "don't do anything special"
[01:51:05] <Murugaratham> it caches xhr get from what i know
[01:51:06] <Cork> cache: false means add a timestamp at the end of the url
[01:51:21] <Murugaratham> which forces a retrieval from server?
[01:51:27] <Cork> yes
[01:51:32] <theBrettman> y would they need it then if it doesn't cache anyway?
[01:51:37] <Cork> cause the browser caches based on the full url
[01:51:42] <dualcore> theBrettman: are you asking how to access the browser cache?
[01:51:47] <theBrettman> aha
[01:51:51] <theBrettman> there u go
[01:52:02] <Cork> so http://www.example.com/img.png is not the same as so http://www.example.com/img.png?_=1
[01:52:15] <EdwardIII> hrm time to do my first selenium test from python
[01:52:17] <theBrettman> so it depends on the browser. let me guess, there's no standard and that's what the html5 stuff is for
[01:52:45] <Cork> theBrettman: no this is an OLD hack and has been around as long as browsers has used cache
[01:52:51] <Murugaratham> what are u planning to do with the cache
[01:52:52] <Cork> and works cross browsers
[01:52:59] <Murugaratham> i think we are talking about different things lol
[01:53:01] <Cork> some proxies break it though
[01:53:24] <Murugaratham> Cork & i are talking bout jQuery cache, theBrettman is talking about browser cache object?
[01:53:29] <Cork> Murugaratham: we'r talking about the cache option for $.ajax
[01:53:42] <theBrettman> yes
[01:53:47] <Cork> Murugaratham: jquery doens't have an ajax cache
[01:53:56] <theBrettman> I mean the browser cache
[01:54:08] <twoface> varnie, your non-working example runs your $('#foo') code before the dom is finished loading
[01:54:11] <theBrettman> if it's being cached, I might as well use it, right?
[01:54:34] <Murugaratham> if it's ajax get the browser caches it
[01:54:38] <Cork> theBrettman: unless you fetch live data yes
[01:54:56] <theBrettman> so nothing caches my json response?
[01:55:03] <Cork> it does
[01:55:14] <theBrettman> what does?
[01:55:20] <Cork> unless the cache workaround is used
[01:55:23] <Murugaratham> u can try to do a static services that returns something
[01:55:30] <theBrettman> I want the cache
[01:55:33] <Murugaratham> and u update it and see if your ajax returns u the updated value
[01:55:44] <theBrettman> the cache will be refreshed on update
[01:55:53] <Murugaratham> nope, it returns u the old value
[01:56:10] <theBrettman> not if I update the cache on update
[01:56:18] <theBrettman> that is the plan
[01:56:18] <Murugaratham> hmm.. lol
[01:56:33] <Murugaratham> if u have a web service that returns u timestamp
[01:56:36] <theBrettman> if it's already in place, y make my own?
[01:56:48] <Murugaratham> and jquery ajax cache option is true
[01:57:07] <Murugaratham> you can call it 23842934 times, when you console.log it, it's always the same value
[01:57:11] <Cork> its true by default for get but not post
[01:57:21] <theBrettman> well what is a cache? it hold a value, right? can't I just change that value?
[01:57:28] <Murugaratham> it's client side
[01:57:33] <Cork> no you can't
[01:57:39] <theBrettman> I want the response, not the get or post
[01:58:00] <Cork> theBrettman: you can't modify the cache at all
[01:58:03] <theBrettman> what's a cache for if u can't access it?
[01:58:08] <Cork> that would be a security problem
[01:58:13] <theBrettman> nvm, I get it
[01:58:28] <Cork> the cache is there to cache network trafic
[01:58:30] <Murugaratham> u can specify the ajax type, you know that?
[01:58:32] <theBrettman> so if anything, I'd be setting cache to false or get stuck with what I don't want
[01:58:37] <Cork> its the same cache that caches your images and html files
[01:58:57] <Cork> theBrettman: or you can handle what image to use through your own cache variable
[01:59:11] <Cork> just suflix ?_=<identifyer>
[01:59:25] <Murugaratham> $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); <- this is global
[01:59:39] <Murugaratham> you can specify the option for individual ajax
[01:59:52] <theBrettman> I will use an isset function then and that will tell me if my cache var is set already
[02:00:00] <Murugaratham> hmm
[02:00:02] <theBrettman> and then have an update function to update it
[02:00:17] <theBrettman> that way it only fetches if it doesn't exist
[02:00:20] <Murugaratham> i think you need to understand this caching thingie
[02:00:37] <theBrettman> it's simple, I need a json dataset
[02:00:49] <Murugaratham> i think you are treating it more like a local variable
[02:00:54] <theBrettman> I need it to populate a few different things at different times
[02:01:13] <Murugaratham> how different? in what sense?
[02:01:17] <theBrettman> someone else suggested earlier to store it in a var
[02:01:33] <Murugaratham> it depends what u are populating at what time
[02:01:44] <Murugaratham> becoz i still don't have much of a clue what you are trying to achieve
[02:01:47] <theBrettman> one populates a dialog, the other a menu
[02:01:57] <Murugaratham> 2 ajax calls?
[02:02:00] <Murugaratham> or a chained function
[02:02:08] <theBrettman> ajax calls
[02:02:14] <Murugaratham> 1 or 2?
[02:02:17] <theBrettman> 2
[02:02:40] <Murugaratham> first call populates the first dialog, 2nd call to populate a menu based on the first call's result?
[02:02:58] <theBrettman> nvm, they have different data anyway
[02:03:04] <Cork> theBrettman: don't forget to set the cache time in the http header
[02:03:08] <theBrettman> I forgot about the nonce
[02:03:43] <Murugaratham> well, in ajax, there's a success callback, you can do ur 2nd function there
[02:03:45] <Cork> ?g http expires header
[02:03:46] <bot-t> Cork, HTTP/1.1: Header Field Definitions - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html
[02:04:25] <theBrettman> oh wait, no the nonce doesn't go there anyway... grr, this is so complex
[02:04:41] <theBrettman> I will have to look at everything from further back, lol
[02:04:44] <Murugaratham> good luck :) knocking off from work
[02:04:44] <theBrettman> it's not easy
[02:05:01] <theBrettman> maybe I can do it all in the same function
[02:05:35] <theBrettman> everytime I change my code, it's like I gotta rewrite the whole thing
[02:05:40] <theBrettman> and it's huge
[02:06:32] <theBrettman> but when I'm done, it will be a lot smaller
[02:17:58] <theBrettman> epiphany!
[02:19:00] <theBrettman> I have been posting stuff to my php script and having it set values in the array and then store it when I should do that on the client side and then just sent the string to be stored
[02:19:17] <theBrettman> the less my server has to do, the better
[02:20:38] <Cork> as long as that data is ok to be cached, that exactly what the http cache are there for
[02:21:09] <theBrettman> actually, I don't know what to use and not sure I can explain this but it has something to do with an object
[02:21:14] <Cork> theBrettman: but as i said, don't forget to set the http headers so you can control how long it will use the cache before it askes again
[02:21:22] <theBrettman> since json is object notation
[02:21:28] <Cork> not really
[02:21:31] <Cork> json is just a string
[02:21:42] <theBrettman> ok, a string that contains arrays
[02:21:44] <Cork> its then parsed to javascript objects
[02:21:50] <theBrettman> anyway, I can access it with dot notation
[02:21:59] <Cork> after its parsed yes
[02:22:12] <theBrettman> I never had to parse my responses?
[02:22:14] <Cork> before no, then its just a string
[02:22:21] <Cork> your using getJSON?
[02:22:26] <theBrettman> no
[02:22:31] <Cork> or mimetype application/json?
[02:22:43] <Cork> or $.ajax with type: 'json'
[02:22:51] <theBrettman> it's storing the string in a row in the database
[02:23:02] <theBrettman> the php fetches it
[02:23:20] <Cork> ya, but you can't send javascript objects over http
[02:23:35] <Cork> you send json, and that text is then parsed to a javascript object
[02:23:45] <theBrettman> php json encodes it
[02:24:05] <Cork> ?eval ('{"value":"this is json"}').value
[02:24:07] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[02:24:11] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"value":"this is json"}').value
[02:24:11] <bot-t> Cork: "this is json"
[02:24:23] <Cork> json is json, and needs to be parsed
[02:24:31] <Cork> jquery does it for you most of the time
[02:24:39] <theBrettman> how come I can do response.value then?
[02:24:56] <Cork> cause jquery parses json that it recognizes
[02:25:25] <theBrettman> ok, so anyway, I want to setup an object I guess
[02:25:32] <theBrettman> assign the json to an object
[02:25:43] <theBrettman> not sure I said that right but I'm sure u know what I mean
[02:25:47] <Cork> theBrettman: why not just use the http cache?
[02:25:57] <theBrettman> cuz u said I can't update it
[02:26:06] <Cork> you shouldn't have to
[02:26:12] <theBrettman> yes, if I change something
[02:26:23] <theBrettman> I may change something in the array and store that in the database
[02:26:30] <theBrettman> maybe I'll add to it
[02:26:35] <Cork> /my_php_script.php?data_to_return=1
[02:26:37] <Cork> /my_php_script.php?data_to_return=2
[02:26:38] <Cork> and so on
[02:26:39] <theBrettman> then I need to get the values from it
[02:26:48] <Cork> the server sends the correct data and the cache works
[02:27:13] <Cork> the server can even control when it feels the browser should ask again
[02:27:29] <theBrettman> ok, say I have templates and sidebars and the application is an editor. it has forms to add new templates and sidebars...
[02:27:31] <Cork> ex. expire the cache acter 5 mins
[02:27:43] <Cork> *after
[02:28:30] <Xotix> IF you have an div. in that div you got an ul. there you got some simple inputs with labels. If you do $( "ul, li" ).disableSelection(); the form is still clickable in chrome, safari etc. but not in firefox, there it is disabled, at least for left click. You still can rightclick it. Is that a known issue?
[02:28:40] <theBrettman> templates is a row in the options table and so is widgets
[02:29:11] <theBrettman> if I add a new widget, I need to update the database so that all applications requiring it can use it too
[02:29:18] <theBrettman> and I need it locally for my editor
[02:29:59] <theBrettman> back to my thinking chair...
[02:30:43] <theBrettman> not sure y my brain has to complicate simple comcepts
[02:30:55] <theBrettman> *concepts
[02:31:12] <arvidkahl> i bet it enjoys thinking :D
[02:32:21] <theBrettman> that's all it ever does
[02:32:36] <theBrettman> and farts a lot
[02:35:44] <DreamStiffler> how do i do this in javascript not in jquery
[02:35:44] <DreamStiffler> $(e).closest("td").next().text();
[02:36:35] <Cork> uh $(e) ?
[02:36:36] <DreamStiffler> and guess what its a continuation from my last problem...somehow IE is not responding..soo im backtracking
[02:36:44] <Cork> whats e?
[02:36:45] <DreamStiffler> e = this
[02:37:51] <DreamStiffler> hellue colhead my hero
[02:38:43] <coldhead> hellue yourself my good man
[02:39:30] <Cork> DreamStiffler: var parent = this.parentNode; while(parent.nodeType === 'TD' || parent.nodeType === 'BODY') { parent = parent.parentNode }; var target = parent.nextSibling; return target.innerText || target.textContent;
[02:40:22] <Cork> DreamStiffler: you need to add a check for if it didn't find the td too
[02:43:16] <DreamStiffler> gimme an hour to try and understand
[02:43:17] <DreamStiffler> bl
[02:43:18] <DreamStiffler> thanks
[02:43:51] <dinduks> Hi guys
[02:44:50] <Cork> DreamStiffler: GAH sorry it should be while(parent.nodeType !== 'TD' && parent.nodeType !== 'BODY')
[02:44:50] <mindis|wurk> hmm. strange. i'm creating dynamic inputs and try to apply a datepicker to them but it doesn't appear to work. it assigns the id and class to the input but on click nothing happens
[02:45:38] <DreamStiffler> allthose consiced to the last line u gave? or ?
[02:46:50] <DreamStiffler> nvm
[02:47:02] <Benit> hi all
[02:47:21] <Benit> Im a total novice with jquery and i've a dout
[02:47:28] <Benit> i've got a link which is inside an structure like  <div class="a"><div class="b"><div class="c"><a href="" class="edit"></a></div></div></div>
[02:47:42] <Benit> when i press the link i whant to get the div class = a
[02:47:58] <Benit> i've been playing with closest parent parents and i cannot manage to get it
[02:48:01] <rasmusth> when using the following code: http://pastie.org/3487213 the load callback is called before the image inside the poster element is loaded
[02:48:06] <Cork> DreamStiffler: to explain it; it first grabs the parent from this; then it loops over the code that grabs the next parent untill the type of the element is td or body (to prevent null pointer)
[02:48:26] <Benit> does anyone knows how I've to aproach it?
[02:48:37] <Cork> DreamStiffler: and then it just does the nextSibling and grabs the text (gecko doens't support innerText so you need textContent too)
[02:48:41] <rasmusth> any ideas?
[02:50:23] <xec> Benit: .closest(".a") should do the trick, what does your click handler look like?
[02:50:45] <Benit> wait
[02:50:51] <Benit> pastebin
[02:52:10] <Benit> http://pastebin.com/M4vADprW
[02:53:31] <rasmusth> when using the following code: http://pastie.org/3487213 the load callback is called before the image inside the poster element is loaded. isnt it possible to get a callback once it is done loading it all?
[02:54:18] <Cork> rasmusth: no
[02:54:27] <Cork> load triggers when the html is added
[02:54:45] <Benit> xec: looks like i've got a miss spell thank you closest works fine :)
[02:54:47] <Cork> you need to attach a load event to the img tag to catch when its done
[02:54:49] <Benit> thank you
[02:54:57] <xec> np
[02:55:15] <rasmusth> Cork ok
[02:55:21] <Cork> rasmusth: and that has to happen before you add it to the dom
[02:55:26] <Cork> or you might miss the event
[02:56:18] <Cork> rasmusth: a little correction, the callback is a callback called when jquery has added the html to the dom, its not a load event
[02:56:20] <rasmusth> Cork: so I have to build two different ajax functions serverside, one for the markup and one for the image?
[02:56:31] <Cork> no
[02:56:40] <Cork> but you can prob not use load
[02:56:51] <rasmusth> okay
[02:57:02] <rasmusth> any suggestions?
[02:58:12] <nixfloyd> guys, quick question, can't seem to get it to work. I'm generating a form by javascript (using $("#dev-name").html() ) in the current page. After that, can I get the values of the form elements in another function on the same page?
[02:58:42] <Cork> rasmusth: $.get(url, function(data) { var post = $(data).find('#post'); post.find('img').each(function() { $(this).load(function() { alert('loaded!'); }); }); target.html(post); });
[02:58:58] <nixfloyd> like "if $("#element-id").is(":checked") "
[02:59:33] <xec> Cork: that's a lot of weird looking smileys
[02:59:40] <Cork> :)
[03:00:02] <rasmusth> Cork thanks I am looking
[03:00:02] <Cork> break it out onto new lines and it should be easier to read
[03:03:41] <rasmusth> Cork yeh I did
[03:03:46] <nFFF> Does .load() take just a callback? never knew that
[03:03:46] <rasmusth> looks clever
[03:05:07] <nFFF> Why doesn't you can use load() as an event in the docs :<
[03:05:12] <nFFF> ?load()
[03:05:12] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:05:25] <nFFF> Ah ok :>>
[03:08:42] <rasmusth> Cork it works
[03:08:46] <rasmusth> did you just write that up?
[03:09:17] <Cork> ya
[03:09:18] <xec> i bet he did, he's some sort of savant i believe
[03:09:22] <xec> there you go
[03:12:09] <rasmusth> Cork: thanks a lot
[03:12:14] <Cork> np
[03:15:12] <VorTechS> hi all, need a little help with jQuery/JS :)
[03:15:43] <VorTechS> If I store an array of callback functions, and use jQuery.each to iterate them, how can I actually fire one?
[03:17:01] <VorTechS> here's what I'm trying to do: http://pastebin.com/mHLbgMHF
[03:19:45] <DreamStiffler> Cork: excuse me but i cant get it to work...can you have a look at it at http://jsfiddle.net/vHZdF/2/
[03:20:47] <twoface> VorTechS, seems like you are already doing it
[03:23:00] <VorTechS> twoface: well that's what I thought, but the callback is an anonymous delegate defined like this: new function () { SomeFunction; }
[03:23:45] <twoface> precisely like that? then it doesn't return SomeFunction, and it can't be called
[03:24:16] <VorTechS> yes, if I define it with parenthesis it fires when JS parses, and that causes problems
[03:24:34] <VorTechS> I'm guessing I need to define it another way
[03:24:37] <twoface> new function() { return SomeFunction; } ?
[03:25:01] <twoface> then you should be able to call it callback()() (although it is ugly)
[03:25:41] <VorTechS> ah that's awesome!  Thanks! :)
[03:26:18] <Ad0> hey I have a tablesorter with custom textExtraction... it extracts the text fine, but it doesn't seem to sort on date even if I defined it on that header
[03:26:18] <DreamStiffler> Cork: maybe onclick the td instead of the checkbox?
[03:26:23] <Ad0> it just sorts alphabetically?
[03:26:56] <VorTechS> twoface: it also didn't need the second set of parenthesis!
[03:27:27] <twoface> great - then I misunderstood you :)
[03:28:09] <VorTechS> the key was the 'return'
[03:29:57] <Cork> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/vHZdF/11/
[03:30:08] <DreamStiffler> ok hold up
[03:30:23] <Cork> it was nodeName not nodeType
[03:30:32] <Wiz_KeeD> does anyone have any ideea why .hide() and .show() do not work for .options in a select menu when using a mobile devicE?
[03:30:36] <Wiz_KeeD> everything else seems to work...
[03:31:02] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: i don't think you can set display: none on option
[03:31:13] <Cork> at least not cross browsers
[03:31:15] <Wiz_KeeD> it works on the pc
[03:31:21] <Wiz_KeeD> then how would i hide it?
[03:31:32] <Cork> you don't
[03:31:37] <Wiz_KeeD> pff
[03:31:38] <Cork> you move them out of there
[03:31:52] <Wiz_KeeD> and then i need to move them back in
[03:31:58] <Cork> yup
[03:31:58] <Wiz_KeeD> that means i need to store them somewhere
[03:32:02] <Wiz_KeeD> that sucks...
[03:32:08] <Cork> like the .data object ya
[03:32:16] <Wiz_KeeD> what do you mean?
[03:32:38] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options')
[03:33:08] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options', $('select option')[0]); $('select option').eq(0).detatch()
[03:33:22] <DreamStiffler> ok thanks Cork...i need to leave coz they locking ze door..ill get back to ya on this if i have any questions. thanks anyway
[03:33:36] <Cork> DreamStiffler: hmm sorry that won't work
[03:33:42] <Cork> that would only store one element
[03:33:49] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options', [])
[03:33:59] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options').push($('select option')[0]); $('select option').eq(0).detatch()
[03:34:48] <DreamStiffler> Cork: what wont work? if it doesnt i guess ill have to work it out. but theres no error now..so i might work with it..thanks nonetheless
[03:34:57] <DreamStiffler> cork: l8r
[03:42:06] <sx2020> does anyone here use history.js, or know about it ?
[03:47:02] <austincheney> I changed a variable name from "$" to "$$" to make the tool compatible with jQuery
[03:47:12] <austincheney> is "$$" compatible with jQuery?
[03:47:58] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys... Is there a way to only perform an action on e.g. the 2 first matches? If I have 100 hidden items with class="togglehide", and I only wanted to show the two first, how would I do that? Currently I have $('.togglehide:hidden').show();, but that shows all of them
[03:48:18] <jaffipaffi> austincheney: You can create your own identifier with jquery noconflict
[03:49:06] <jaffipaffi> austincheney: var j = jQuery.noConflict();
[03:49:10] <austincheney> yeah, but my tool does not implement jQuery
[03:49:30] <austincheney> i just want to be without conflict to others who do wish to use it with jquery
[03:49:34] <quicksilver> jaffipaffi: http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[03:50:04] <quicksilver> jaffipaffi: or http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[03:50:12] <claudio> austincheney, so, implement a noConflict() method in your tool
[03:50:41] <jaffipaffi> Thanks quicksilver
[03:50:56] <claudio> austincheney, ($$ is used by Prototypejs)
[03:51:33] <austincheney> i would have to include jquery to use its noconflict method though
[03:52:04] <austincheney> I wonder if anybody uses _$
[03:52:31] <claudio> austincheney, no. You implement *your* noConflict() method in YOUR tool. It's really simple. Just take a look at the jquery source
[03:53:21] <claudio> then you can use anything you want, and tell people to you your  noConflict() method
[03:53:27] <claudio> *to use
[03:54:05] <austincheney> ah, thanks claudio
[04:19:30] <QKO|Work> hello
[04:19:37] <QKO|Work> I'm sending something using ajax
[04:19:44] <QKO|Work> but one of my variables does not get sent
[04:19:52] <QKO|Work> variable name is context
[04:19:56] <fof> can anyone help me with this? http://i.imgur.com/kkibo.jpg
[04:19:59] <QKO|Work> and it quit sending that today
[04:21:53] <mindis|wurk> fof that could lead to pipeline overloads and datastream corruption
[04:24:06] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to jquery and wonder if there  is a way to check when $(window).scroll ends? and i don't mean when the user scrolled to the bottom or top of the page. i mean when he stops scrolling
[04:26:19] <Hooloovoo> mightym: umm... what do you mean by stops?
[04:26:37] <dgx> Hey guys, Im looking for a very simple fade/fadeout slider(with links). Any reccomendations?
[04:26:38] <dreamOfLife> Hello, I just started to learn js and jquery and I am having problem with simple alert(); As Result I get null, but book says I should get <p> tag and its content as result
[04:26:52] <dreamOfLife> http://jsfiddle.net/wwYz6/
[04:26:53] <Hooloovoo> mightym: each scroll is kinda like a mouse click. it's something that happens repeatedly, not something that starts and ends
[04:27:21] <Hooloovoo> mightym: if you want it to "start" and "end" you have to define what you mean by that yourself
[04:28:45] <QKO|Work> anyone?
[04:29:04] <mightym> Hooloovoo: ok, actually right now i checking if scrollTop is changing in the last x seconds, and that means "stop" for me. but in browsers like safari and chrome you have this momentum scroll, which means you scroll 1 time and the browser is still scrolling for a few milliseconds
[04:29:11] <Hooloovoo> QKO|Work: sounds like it's value isn't defined. check it.
[04:29:36] <QKO|Work> Hooloovoo: the value is defined
[04:29:50] <Hooloovoo> mightym: nothing like that afaik. you can use a timeout to see if scrollTop changes there too.
[04:29:51] <QKO|Work> it's converted in the datastring(I checked the jQuery code underneath)
[04:30:04] <QKO|Work> it's send through the dom
[04:30:20] <QKO|Work> and then when chrome/firefox should be sending the full thing
[04:30:27] <Hooloovoo> QKO|Work: so you have lime var postdata = { asd: "teehee", pfft: "ehehehe" };?
[04:30:28] <QKO|Work> they take it of
[04:30:34] <Hooloovoo> and then send that as postdata?
[04:30:41] <QKO|Work> yes
[04:30:52] <Hooloovoo> print the postdata var and see what's in it
[04:30:53] <QKO|Work> and it if I rename context to xcontext it does get send
[04:31:06] <mightym> Hooloovoo: and if scroll is like a mouse click is there something like mouse up? that was what I'm thinking about when talking about "stop" â€¦ like "the user has scrolled"
[04:31:09] <Hooloovoo> context shouldn't be reserved
[04:32:07] <Hooloovoo> mightym: yup. just lemme check google to see how to get the events
[04:33:27] <mightym> Hooloovoo: sry, i already googled around but just found solutions which check if the offset changed and if not fire an event :(
[04:34:14] <mightym> didn't want to bother you
[04:34:41] <Hooloovoo> mightym: well, how would you like it to be done?
[04:36:24] <Hooloovoo> mightym: this is how i've done it before http://viralpatel.net/blogs/2009/08/javascript-mouse-scroll-event-down-example.html
[04:36:43] <mightym> well what i actually do is: $(window).scroll( -> check if scrollTop changes â€¦ but what id like to have is $(window).scrollStop( oder some kind of callback when .scroll was executed
[04:37:39] <Hooloovoo> mightym: well you won't have that unless you build it
[04:37:54] <QKO|Work> Hooloovoo: is there anything that can influence how the xhr works?
[04:38:11] <Hooloovoo> QKO|Work: might be, but i've never heard of anything like that.
[04:38:43] <Hooloovoo> mightym: don't have time to write up a example right now. you have to detect if the soft scroll is done yourself. it can be done quite easily
[04:39:03] <Hooloovoo> mightym: so either figure it out or wait a few hours until i get off work =P
[04:39:27] <mightym> Hooloovoo: ok :) I'm relieved to hear that. so at least i can stop looking around for sty like scrollEnd ;)
[04:41:24] <Hooloovoo> mightym: yes there's nothing like that. on the scroll event you have to set a interval to check and wait for the scrolling to end
[04:41:29] <Hooloovoo> you're half way there already
[04:48:05] <Wiz_KeeD> what is the best way to show/hide options from a select box?
[04:57:59] <Guest50377> hi people.  have an advocacy-related topic.  in my dev team, we mostly work on demos and proof-of-concept.  mostly front-ends with backends being simulated
[04:58:12] <Guest50377> i'm very big on html5 / css3 / jquery (ui) etc
[04:58:44] <Guest50377> my colleague is insistent that it's "faster and easier" to develop in java with gwt.  :(
[04:58:49] <Guest50377> this is painful, of course
[04:59:04] <Guest50377> why do we need to compile stuff all the time?
[04:59:17] <Guest50377> any ideas as to what i might tell him, given that i haven't already gotten through?
[04:59:32] <Guest50377> i think it is an issue of that he has been doing java for years, so wants to use it for everything
[05:00:17] <znf> cut of his hand
[05:00:34] <Guest50377> znf: i was hoping for something a little more serious
[05:00:42] <znf> cut of his pinky?
[05:00:50] <Guest50377> plus he is going on about having a gui to develop with *facepalm*
[05:01:07] <znf> there's nothing you can do to that kind of person(s)
[05:01:34] <_dave_h_d> hi all using jquery with some closure compiled code (have defined it as extern) and it gives us this: object is undefined
[05:01:43] <_dave_h_d> length = object.length,
[05:01:47] <Guest50377> i know what this audience would say, but is there any chance that he might be *right*?  to me there's nothing easier than lobbing together a lightweight html template et al, and loading it in the browser
[05:02:06] <_dave_h_d> and points to this jquery function :// args is for internal usage only
[05:02:06] <_dave_h_d> each: function( object, callback, args ) {
[05:03:02] <_dave_h_d> btw using jquery-1.6.2.js
[05:03:10] <xec> Guest50377: gwt compiles java to javascript?
[05:03:30] <znf> Guest50377, well, he sounds indoctrinated with Java - so, again, whatever you're gonna tell him is not gonna make a difference to him.
[05:03:56] <Guest50377> xec: i have no idea, but the most relevant point is that they want to use java, which just seems like it will put loads of shit in the way
[05:04:30] <fof> what type of software are you prototyping?
[05:04:35] <Guest50377> znf: the problem is that he's on my team, and i've already been told that he discussed it with the third dev who will be working on this, and if 2/3 agree that java is faster and easier, it must be so *facepalm*
[05:05:05] <xec> Guest50377: well, without a plugin in the browser you can't use java, as javascript is the only language supported natively in browsers
[05:05:19] <Guest50377> fof: it's nothing complex.  few panes, buttons, tree or two, pie chart here or there
[05:05:34] <znf> Guest50377, people are comfortable with what they know. I wouldn't put that much thought in it. It depends on where your interface is supposed to be used.
[05:05:34] <Guest50377> why is my nickname not antgel? :(
[05:05:38] <fof> i mean, is it for desktop apps?
[05:05:50] <znf> If it's browser that we're talking about, then they're downright retarded.
[05:06:11] <xec> antgel: so, there really is no discussion - for websites you need javascript. assuming we are talking client side development
[05:06:14] <fof> but anyway if it was 2:1 against me, i'd suck my thumb
[05:06:22] <znf> If it's supposed to be a desktop app, then there's stuff to discuss.
[05:06:29] <mindis|wurk> what the...seriously, javascripts date object accepts dates in mm/dd/yyyy format? what a joke
[05:06:30] <fof> unless they want to prototype sites in java
[05:06:34] <Cork> antgel: just a heads up, its quite common ppl don't have java plugins
[05:06:37] <antgel> znf, fof: well, there's no official desktop *or* browser requirement.  i've been around a long time, but even i recognize that most things fit in the browser pretty nicely these days
[05:07:01] <Cork> antgel: just as a fact, i uninstalled java from both my parents computers this last weekend
[05:07:05] <antgel> Cork, xec: it would be demoed to a client by us in house.  i don't think anyone cares if it's in a browser or not
[05:07:06] <xec> Cork: he mentioned google web toolkit, which includes "GWT Java-to-JavaScript Compiler"
[05:07:22] <Cork> ..
[05:07:27] <xec> Cork: which, to me, sounds like a horrible horrible idea
[05:07:34] <Cork> why not write it in c++ when your at it?
[05:07:38] <xec> indeed
[05:07:56] <xec> NaCl ftw
[05:07:57] <Cork> and then compile it with emscripten
[05:07:59] <antgel> so fine, whatever, i think i'll just have a word with my manager and see if i can get out of the project and work on my main focus (ironically trying to modernize the dev cycle and change mindset)
[05:08:01] <Cork> ?g emscripten
[05:08:01] <znf> antgel, so that's what you're doing? Compiling Java to JavaScript?
[05:08:01] <xec> :P
[05:08:02] <bot-t> Cork, kripken/emscripten - GitHub - https://github.com/kripken/emscripten
[05:08:11] <fof> personally if it isn't specifically a site, i'd much prefer to use c# + winforms or something to mock something up
[05:08:59] <antgel> znf: i'm not doing anything yet.  i started to write the prototype yesterday and then got told that actually i shouldn't have started until we'd discussed it (read: until he'd told me that we're using java because it's "faster and easier and has a gui dev tool")
[05:09:06] <antgel> probably eclipse
[05:09:11] * antgel holds head in hands
[05:09:53] <Cork> a bit sadening ya
[05:10:03] <antgel> or maybe i proceed with my effort regardless.  i'm new to jquery but i still kind of fancy my chances of getting something done quicker and better.  oh, the deadline is very tight (end next week!)
[05:10:11] <Cork> compiler to javascript won't ever be as fast as sites written in javascript from the start
[05:10:16] <xec> a gui dev tool is a good thing really, but a decent one doesnt exist for web development
[05:10:33] <Wiz_KeeD> Cork, do you think you can help me out hiding/showing the options on the select box?
[05:10:50] <fof> antgel: tell them java is ok, but buy you an IDEA license :)
[05:11:06] <Cork> i can give you hints as you ask for them; but i'm at work and can't really sit down and write it
[05:11:11] <antgel> fof: no :D
[05:11:41] <antgel> okay, well thanks people for letting me know that i'm actually sane here.  i'm walking a bit of a political tightrope
[05:12:58] <Wiz_KeeD> so first of all i need to store all the options somewhere right?
[05:13:00] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i do that...
[05:13:14] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options', [])
[05:13:21] <Cork> $('select').data('hidden-options').push($('select option')[0]);
[05:13:28] <Cork> then you can just push them into there
[05:13:55] <Nece228> hello
[05:14:00] <Cork> (line one you just need to run once)
[05:14:27] <fleur_> oh Cork, you just make me doubt myself a lot
[05:14:32] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: or you can keep them in a jquery selector if you prefer
[05:14:36] <Wiz_KeeD> so i do var options = $('select').data('hidden-options', [])
[05:14:36] <Nece228> i currently search with onkeyup: $('#search').keyup(function() {
[05:14:40] <fleur_> maDe
[05:14:42] <Wiz_KeeD> how does that work Cork ?
[05:14:46] <Cork> fleur_?
[05:15:05] <Nece228> but i want to search it when pressed button, i already created it it has its div called button. how to do this?
[05:15:17] <itonohito> hi, guys :)
[05:15:20] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: .data is just a function that let you add a variable assosiated to the element
[05:15:41] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah so i've noticed, thanks let me try
[05:15:54] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: and as i said, if you want to use jquery selectors
[05:15:57] <fleur_> Cork: when I left to eat, the last thing I saw in here was your sample code with push, and then I get back and I see it again like I jsut saw it, and I was sure I saw it before lunch
[05:16:12] <Cork> do $('select').data('hidden-options', options)
[05:16:12] <phil-adept> Hi all. Does anyone have any recomended jquery file upload plugins?
[05:16:22] <Cork> options = options.add(new_option);
[05:16:28] <fleur_> Cork: arg, I'm tired too, so my english is bad
[05:16:31] <phil-adept> I've looked at uploadify, but we've had too many issues with it before
[05:16:53] <Cork> fleur_: lol
[05:16:56] <xec> fleur_: i got a deja vu moment too
[05:17:09] <Wiz_KeeD> 		$('#vending_machine_id').data('options', [])		console.log(options); doesn't bring up anything
[05:17:23] <Cork> doesn't work like that
[05:17:31] <Wiz_KeeD> my bad then
[05:17:43] <Cork> $('#vending_machine_id').data('options', []) stors an empty array in $('#vending_machine_id').data('options')
[05:17:54] <Cork> its a setter and getter
[05:18:07] <LukeNukem> yo Wiz_KeeD
[05:18:11] <LukeNukem> hello CORALZX
[05:18:13] <Wiz_KeeD> hello LukeNukem
[05:18:14] <LukeNukem> Cork, *
[05:18:19] <Cork> o/
[05:18:27] <LukeNukem> whats o/
[05:18:33] <LukeNukem> wave?
[05:18:34] <Cork> o <-- my head
[05:18:42] <LukeNukem> its wave.
[05:18:44] <Cork> / <-- my right arm :)
[05:18:44] <Wiz_KeeD> haha
[05:18:45] <Cork> :)
[05:18:55] <Wiz_KeeD> \0/
[05:18:57] <Wiz_KeeD> |
[05:19:04] <Wiz_KeeD> /\
[05:19:10] <Wiz_KeeD> more graphics
[05:19:13] <Wiz_KeeD> yay
[05:19:19] <Wiz_KeeD> ok so i set that empty array, then what
[05:19:37] <Cork> one sec i think its faster to wipp up an example
[05:19:37] <xec> put all the things in the array
[05:20:01] <LukeNukem> var oldlikescount = $(this).data("likes");
[05:20:01] <LukeNukem> var newlikescount = parseInt(oldlikescount) -1;
[05:20:02] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks a lot man
[05:20:15] <LukeNukem> its suppose to subtract, it adds o.o
[05:22:27] <phil-adept> anyone?
[05:22:43] <phil-adept> does anyone have any recomended jquery file upload plugins?
[05:22:46] <LukeNukem> nvm fixed
[05:23:00] <jita> How can i sort the table ?
[05:23:02] <jita> by columns ?
[05:23:03] <skylamer`> x:)
[05:23:05] <LukeNukem> phil-adept, uploadify is what i get recommended always
[05:23:12] <VorTechS> ^^
[05:28:48] <titii> Hello
[05:28:54] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: http://jsfiddle.net/EDDCX/
[05:30:08] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm
[05:30:21] <Wiz_KeeD> i need to adapt that to my scenario somehow...
[05:32:05] <titii> I thought the $(".news-latest-item a:eq(0)").addClass('mouseover'); is for all the first a tag elements of .news-latest-item. But it's only for the first element a tag. Why?
[05:32:13] <pif> hi, in a (say) click event handler, 'this' is the element clicked?
[05:32:46] <xec> titii: "all the first"?
[05:32:54] <Cork> titii: eq means first in the selection list
[05:32:56] <titii> xec: yes
[05:32:59] <Cork> you prob want :first
[05:33:15] <erichynds> :first-child
[05:33:31] <rworth> pif: yes
[05:33:44] <titii> All Thank you guys it should be this... thank you :)
[05:33:50] <Cork> first-child isn't cross browser
[05:33:59] <erichynds> jquery makes it cross browser
[05:34:16] <Cork> even in ie< 9 ?
[05:34:23] <erichynds> it isn't a javascript selector to begin with
[05:34:25] <erichynds> all sizzle
[05:34:36] <Cork> erichynds: no
[05:34:39] <xec> fo' shizzle
[05:34:42] <Cork> it uses broweser native selectors if it can
[05:35:00] <pif> rworth: so if 'this' is an 'option' in a 'select', how do I get a the label of that element?
[05:35:02] <Cork> and first-child is a native selector as far as i know
[05:35:04] <pif> in a jq way?
[05:35:15] <erichynds> Cork, i'm saying that you can't pass first-child into QSA, so it must fallback to sizzle
[05:35:23] <erichynds> it is not a valid javascript selector, it is a css3 selector
[05:35:25] <Cork> erichynds: sure you can
[05:35:47] * erichynds researches
[05:37:13] <Cork> ?mdc document.querySelectorAll @ erichynds
[05:37:15] * erichynds is wrong
[05:37:18] <bot-t> erichynds, Document.querySelectorAll - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a list of the elements within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes) that match the specified group of selectors. The object returned is a NodeList . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll
[05:37:36] <rworth> pif: 'this' won't be an 'option' in a click handler
[05:37:50] <_dave_h_d> has anyone used google closure compiler successfully with jquery as an extern?
[05:38:10] <rworth> pif: bak up and state what you're trying to do, rather than how you're trying to do it
[05:38:26] <pif> rworth: hmm, right the 'select' list is 'this'
[05:38:28] <rworth> _dave_h_d: do you mean in advanced mode?
[05:38:40] <_dave_h_d> sorry rworth yes of course
[05:38:50] <_dave_h_d> simple mode is no-pointless
[05:39:20] <rworth> work is being done by some on the closure compiler team. can be tracked on http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-bugs-team/browse_thread/thread/fdd1b17ba29a3b56
[05:39:31] <rworth> perhaps other threads on that list
[05:40:08] <rworth> in short, it's not ready yet, but it's showing promise
[05:40:36] <_dave_h_d> rworth:
[05:40:39] <_dave_h_d> damn
[05:40:47] <_dave_h_d> shame
[05:40:50] <_dave_h_d> :-(
[05:41:10] <rworth> pif: if you're trying to catch a change to a select element, you should likely bind to 'change' rather than 'click'
[05:41:35] <rasmusth> http://pastie.org/3488228 does anybody have an idea of why this doesnt work? the onComplete function is never fired
[05:44:00] <_dave_h_d> rworth: how about combining all the code with jquery and then google closure compiling it?
[05:44:41] <rworth> that's indeed what will be required once it is supported, afaik
[05:44:54] <_dave_h_d> ahh
[05:45:03] <_dave_h_d> cause i have been bring to use --extern
[05:45:05] <_dave_h_d> so far
[05:45:21] <rworth> it could be that I don't understand well enough what other cases may become possible
[05:45:34] <rworth> but at least that one is not possible yet, and is one aim of the work being done
[05:46:14] <titii> Ohh guys it should be easy? If yes, please how to make selector to add class of each .news-latest-item element's for the first A tag
[05:46:58] <titii> Hmm maybe I have to use the each()?
[05:48:49] <erichynds> titii: $(".news-latest-item a:first-child").addClass("foo")
[05:50:34] <bartmax> how to do $('.remove.deliveryzone').live('click', function () { ......  with on ? i change live to on and doesn't work like live
[05:50:42] <titii> erichynds: but in the .news-latest-item block is many A tags, the first-child doesnt work. all the a tags has tha class foo... hmmm
[05:51:14] <erichynds> titii: .news-latest-item is the element you want to match?
[05:51:22] <erichynds> it's the anchor tag?
[05:52:14] <titii> erichynds: no this is the DIV ...
[05:52:47] <titii> erichynds: <div class="news-latest-item"><a ...> ... 6 times
[05:52:59] <titii> 6 times of <div class="news-latest-item">
[05:53:17] <erichynds> and you want that first <a> inside the <div class="news-latest-item"> for each set?
[05:53:29] <titii> erichynds: right
[05:54:11] <titii> i have to use each? or it should works without the each()?
[05:54:36] <erichynds> titii: http://jsfiddle.net/2V5Dr/
[05:57:56] <titii> erichynds: hmmm,, i know what is the problem, but in the element is a P tag, and inside is A tag, so it select also .news-latest-item and A tag of P tag first-child... this is the problem, so how to use not?
[05:58:20] <erichynds> try .news-latest-item p:first-child a
[05:58:56] <titii> erichynds: no, the A p tag and also H2 A tag I do not need
[05:59:09] <erichynds> paste your structure titii
[05:59:15] <titii> erichynds: ok
[05:59:17] <erichynds> in jsfiddle or something else
[06:01:53] <Wiz_KeeD> Cork, i think i made it work by accident!
[06:01:58] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks for your example dude! :D
[06:02:06] <Cork> np
[06:02:23] <titii> erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/DXktJ/1/

[06:07:22] <bibo360> hello ! scott_gonzalez ? can i submit you an issue ?
[06:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> About what?
[06:07:45] <bibo360> just try http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/scroll.html
[06:08:19] <bibo360> whenever i scroll vertically, the helper moves away from cursor
[06:08:20] <antgel> hi again.  is jstree the "most obvious" option for a tree in jquery?  (where of course i'm aware that i haven't explained my use case, but i just want to get some tree in my app quickly for demo purposes)
[06:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6817
[06:10:50] <bibo360> scott_gonzalez:  yeah, had seen the bug report but as there was no activity in there. Wanted to be sure you were aware of it
[06:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, we're aware, we're not working on draggable bugs.
[06:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> All of the interactions are being rewritten from scratch.
[06:11:38] <rasmusth> my site is here: http://realen.dk/drupal/ - the fancybox link that has the callback option which doesnt work is the one called "Handelsbetingelser" at the bottom right of the page. It is supposed to fire an alert.
[06:11:43] <rasmusth> please someone take a look
[06:16:09] <bibo360> scott_gonzalez: ah good news ! but at the same time bad news as i've to deal with my issue for now :(
[06:18:21] <bibo360> would you have some hints about that particular issue ? or shoud i wear my debugger-suit and dive into js-jquery-plumbery ;-)
[06:27:48] <sjobidoo> is it possible to use nth-child() to select multiple children?
[06:27:52] <soee> hi, if i have href attribute with such content: #xyz-123 can i extract somehow only 123 part from it ?
[06:28:00] <sjobidoo> something like nth-child(2,3) if i want 2nd and 3rd :P

[06:38:57] <antgel> i want to use jstree with the tree data in a data.json file rather than polluting my js code.  the json data is provided to .jstree in a parameter - data [ .. json .. ].  how can i get it to reference the external json file by url instead?
[06:41:15] <Xotix> I have a little ajax call. it works in firefox and co but not in IE, why? http://tinyw.in/BLrg actually a second form should be there which action gets changed. If you wonder about the JS.
[06:56:20] <mat-hieu> Hey

[07:10:01] <claudio> "."
[07:10:14] <Zogot> aye sorry .
[07:10:22] <Zogot> ive been spending all day in htmldomscraper
[07:10:28] <Zogot> very similar syntax as jquery
[07:11:22] <mat-hieu> Zogot : The alert display : undefined ...
[07:16:41] <dekub> $("a.button span.rename").focusout(function(){ console.debug('focusout') }); why it not work.
[07:17:21] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with html5 boilerplate build script?

[07:27:45] <Xotix> why should $.post() not work with ie9?
[07:31:02] <JAAulde> I find myself in need of keeping a registry of ajax requests which are in progress.  Rather than modify all code which does ajax, I'd like to use a global function.  `.ajaxSend()` looked pretty useful until I read the docs and saw it was tied to the DOM.  How odd.  Anyone have any suggestions?
[07:32:34] <MSK> Is there any video Slideshow in jquery?
[07:37:26] <JAAulde> why the heck would `.ajaxSend()` be part of `fn` and require the collection hold a DOM element?  PITA!
[07:40:06] <jeffsmykil> How can I envoke an instance of the date picker from an input that isn't present on page load?
[07:40:54] <xec> JAAulde: much like any other event? you could just attach to document i imagine
[07:41:17] <jeffsmykil> was that meant for me?
[07:41:20] <Hooloovoo> jeffsmykil: you run the datepicker function on it when it's created
[07:41:37] <JAAulde> xec: you can bind events to any object in jQ.  `$({}).on('customevent', function () {});` works
[07:42:00] <JAAulde> xec: but with ajaxSend, the event won't fire if it's not a DOM object
[07:42:20] <jeffsmykil> Hooloovoo:  sometimes the answer is so obvious you should hit me with a stick
[07:42:43] <JAAulde> xec: furthermore, I just want to bind to a global event pre-send of any ajax request, but don't need any DOM interaction when it fires.  just need to store a ref to the XHR
[07:43:54] <xec> JAAulde: have you tried $({}).on('ajaxSend', function () {}); ?
[07:44:20] <JAAulde> xec: yes.  both that and $({}).ajaxSend().  neither work
[07:45:03] <Xotix> can someone try this link in  internet explorer? http://tinyw.in/zDLP looks like the $.post() doesn't work, but why?

[07:52:42] <wpsmith> I am trying to show/hide sections based on a select selector & I am doing something wrong. Can someone help me out please? http://jsfiddle.net/MLF8C/2/
[07:56:50] <hurry> how can I not repeat the action if I click a button? if I have a fadeIn and that is done at the click of a button, if I click 100 times I have 100 times this action, how can I not create this "Queue"?
[07:59:22] <Zogot> .stop()
[07:59:23] <Zogot> before animate
[08:00:31] <Zogot> hurry: so $(ele).stop().fadeIn('slow');
[08:00:33] <Zogot> something like that
[08:00:49] <hurry> ok now try thanks Zogot

[08:04:09] <SnackWhack> How can I change the 'title' attribute for all img's with the class 'us_flag' for example?
[08:04:44] <quicksilver> wpsmith: you misunderstand $.each
[08:05:25] <One-Man-Bucket> hmm we have a custom event ("dragstart") that needs to access event.pageX/Y in it's callback
[08:05:37] <One-Man-Bucket> do i need to add pageX and pageY to the proplist?
[08:05:52] <One-Man-Bucket> $.event.props.push("pageX", "pageY");
[08:05:57] <One-Man-Bucket> like that?
[08:06:58] <quicksilver> wpsmith: and you have also confused 'class' and 'id'
[08:07:07] <hurry> Zogot: $("#response").stop().show(); Good thanks
[08:07:34] <wpsmith> quicksliver ok what did I do wrong with $.each?
[08:08:15] <DreamHazard> anyone know how I can pass the div ID that contains a button on the button's click event?
[08:08:22] <quicksilver> wpsmith: when you use $.each you don't get "this" setup, you get either one argument (if you're eaching over an array) or two (over a map) to the callback.
[08:08:26] <quicksilver> wpsmith: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[08:09:47] <DreamHazard> eurgh, just read that back
[08:10:22] <DreamHazard> I want to pass the ID of a div that contains a button as a string to another function, when the button is clicked.
[08:11:39] <JSONB> SnackWhack: â€‹$('.us_flag').attr('title', 'new-title-name');â€‹
[08:11:50] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: $(".something").click(function() {  anotherFunc( this.id );  });
[08:11:58] <SnackWhack> JSONB: Thanks.. I figured it out too
[08:12:38] <obert-> hello,someone had never play with http://flex.madebymufffin.com/ before?
[08:12:40] <DreamHazard> so I use (this.id) to pass the container's ID?
[08:13:29] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: you pass arguments to functions by passing them to the function, and 'this.id' is the containers id, so yes
[08:13:31] <Gaia> he guys, i realy have a problem with my code
[08:13:32] <Gaia> http://pastebin.com/Zgr823Ny
[08:13:44] <Gaia> The banner doesnt work and i realy dont know how to fix it
[08:13:58] <Gaia> if anyone can help me with it, you will be a real life-saver
[08:14:11] <quicksilver> wpsmith: and, finally, you've applied the 'change' event to a div, which does work OK, but "this" won't be the <select> so you can't use .val() on it.
[08:14:14] <Gaia> www.vrijegeesten.com/test/banner.html - working banner
[08:14:24] <DreamHazard> ok, I wasn't sure if this.id would just give me the id of the button
[08:14:35] <quicksilver> ...and, he's gone.
[08:14:49] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: it does.
[08:15:06] <DreamHazard> right, I want the id of the div that holds the button inside
[08:15:11] <ajpiano> oh
[08:15:30] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("div").attr("id')
[08:15:42] <Nece228> hello
[08:15:50] <DreamHazard> that seems likely, I'll try that out, thanks :)
[08:15:56] <Nece228> i currently have a search which searchhes with keyup method
[08:16:07] <Nece228> i want to search it when i press button
[08:16:13] <Nece228> not when i stop typing
[08:16:35] <Gaia> www.elitel.nl
[08:16:51] <Gaia> is the broken banner
[08:17:18] <leandroa> hi, in autocomplete, is there a way to recognize when user focus on dropdown item and then goes back to the field with the keyboard?
[08:17:39] <DreamHazard> ajpiano: Dreamweaver's throwing a fit over that line
[08:17:40] <Gaia> http://pastebin.com/Zgr823Ny
[08:17:47] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: sorry bro
[08:18:25] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: by "throwing a fit" i assume you mean " i have a syntax error that i can't diagnose myself" ?
[08:18:40] <wfq> hi guys
[08:18:52] <DreamHazard> something along those lines. It's refusing to tell me where the error is.
[08:19:21] <ajpiano> DreamHazard: http://jshint.com
[08:19:46] <DreamHazard> ooh, thanks :)
[08:19:57] <jinside> Is anyone familiar with either a) An asynchronous script loading library that executes scripts in the order provided *AND* gives you the ability to save the loaded scripts' data into variables? or b) A way to make jQuery's native $.getScript() download scripts in parallel but execute them in the order the $.getScript() functions are written?
[08:20:04] <wfq> How could I select all elements within a form whose style.class == required? I know how to select elements according to attributes but I don't know how to do it for my case
[08:20:06] <wfq> thanks
[08:20:34] <ajpiano> wfq: $(".required") ?
[08:20:55] <obert-> i wish to dont use a container for the slider but straight the ul, would be easy to change the script in that way,please?
[08:21:10] <JSONB> wfq: $('form').find('.required');
[08:21:33] <DreamHazard> ha, singlequote closing a string instead of double. It's always the little things
[08:23:39] <wfq> sorry I was missing apples with oranges. I meant any element such border color is red for example (style.border.color == red)? is that possible or I need to get the parent element and loop through?
[08:24:31] <claudio> wfq, use classes, never rely on the "computed value" of a property
[08:26:08] <ajpiano> wfq: what claudio said is correct
[08:26:28] <ajpiano> it's pretty much crazy to write an app around things like "find me all elements that have a red border"
[08:26:36] <jeffsmykil> can you do new Date(foo, milliseconds);
[08:27:28] <wfq> unless you know what your are doing. The problem is pretty much fenced and I know this will always be so in the site I am doing for a particular case
[08:27:46] <wfq> that html is generated back from the framework
[08:28:18] <ajpiano> wfq: you can use .filter(function() { /* */   }); do the check
[08:28:40] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: easy way to do a date object to epoch?
[08:29:30] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = new Date(); +foo;
[08:29:35] <bot-t> ajpiano: 1330532968147
[08:30:01] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: coerce it to a number with + or just call .getTime() on it ?
[08:30:27] <wfq> can I not get $(:text).blur (function () {//and then something like if $(this).style.border.color == red     })?
[08:30:36] <jeffsmykil> getTime duh
[08:30:37] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[08:30:54] <wfq> don't know how to get a css attribute
[08:31:10] <ajpiano> wfq: you can do that. just this.style.... or $(this).css("border") or whatnot
[08:31:12] <ajpiano> ?css
[08:31:14] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:31:17] <blankstare> hi all.  i'm experiencing some jerky animations in a slider.  i'm trying to get my head around what could potentially be the cause and it looks like our css isn't playing along with the plugin.  anyone know of any known causes (margins set in parent, margins not set in parent, etc.)?
[08:32:56] <wfq> thanks guys
[08:33:01] <LukeNukem> Hello, is there any way i can use css inside jquery alert box without using jquery UI
[08:34:38] <jeffsmykil> LukeNukem: not that I know of
[08:35:12] <LukeNukem> ok
[08:35:24] <xec> jquery alert box? i didn't even know there was such a thing
[08:35:24] <ajpiano> what is a "jQuery alert box"
[08:35:37] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: if you're using any sort of custom control that creates html in the DOM
[08:35:39] <ajpiano> you can use CSS on it
[08:35:59] <LukeNukem> ajpiano, alert();
[08:36:04] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: hes talking about the native alert
[08:36:06] <ajpiano> ok, that's not a 'jquery alert"
[08:36:09] <ajpiano> then no, you can't.
[08:36:10] <LukeNukem> i dont understand what you mean by custom control? like a div that stands out with a shadow?
[08:36:19] <jeffsmykil> holy shit I was right!
[08:36:22] <LukeNukem> and then use jquery to disable the bg?
[08:36:27] <jeffsmykil> first time for everything
[08:36:36] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: i mean like, a custom alert "replacement"
[08:36:42] <ajpiano> of which there are many
[08:36:52] <ajpiano> like "a div that stands out with a shadow", yes.
[08:37:09] <LukeNukem> thas nice :)
[08:37:33] <jeffsmykil> jquery ui is pretty straightforward once you figure it out
[08:38:05] <LukeNukem> meh i just wanna do things on my own
[08:38:11] <LukeNukem> im pretty insecure..
[08:38:24] <xec> you mean shy
[08:38:25] <jeffsmykil> well you can reinvent the wheel if you'd like
[08:38:37] <jeffsmykil> wouldn't be that hard
[08:39:09] <xec> jeffsmykil: start out with a square. chop off the corners until smooth.
[08:39:37] <LukeNukem> when i use a plugin it makes me feel like im someone who cant do shit on his own
[08:39:48] <jeffsmykil> I used to feel that way
[08:39:53] <jeffsmykil> then time became an issue
[08:39:58] <jeffsmykil> and I know i can do it on my own
[08:40:15] <jeffsmykil> most of the time
[08:40:21] <LukeNukem> so im not the only one :O
[08:40:23] <jeffsmykil> sometimes it's just not worth it man
[08:40:49] <jeffsmykil> why write a date picker when there are all sorts of datepickers out there and it would take me a week from scratch
[08:40:51] <Nece228> could anyone review my code?: http://paste.opensuse.org/56701516
[08:41:13] <Nece228> it works fine when i insert something and press the button #search, but only the first time
[08:41:47] <Nece228> when i delete the text from a field and enter something and press button again nothing happens
[08:41:53] <Nece228> so i need to refresh the page
[08:42:05] <ajpiano> Nece228: is the "#button" inside of the "#search_results" element?
[08:42:29] <LukeNukem> you're right, but time is something i've got plenty and i will try things :)
[08:42:45] <LukeNukem> you know work it all out and then end up using the plugin in the end but satisfied because i know i can do it
[08:42:47] <jeffsmykil> ah you must be in high school and have no gf then LukeNukem
[08:43:14] <LukeNukem> fuckin stalker :|
[08:43:18] <xec> lol
[08:43:26] <Nece228> ajpiano: nope
[08:43:31] <LukeNukem> i am 14 and in high school and have no gf, thats true.
[08:43:51] <jeffsmykil> then by all means sir, write it from scratch
[08:44:03] <jeffsmykil> Im sure zuckerberg had no gf when he was 14
[08:44:26] <LukeNukem> also im wondering...my age and what im studying will indicate that i have plenty of time in my hands, but how does not having a girlfriend prove i have time?
[08:44:27] <xec> Nece228: maybe you're duplicating IDs?
[08:44:33] <LukeNukem> and yes zuckerberg is my idol.
[08:44:44] <jeffsmykil> LukeNukem: Girlfriends are time drains
[08:44:52] <jeffsmykil> LukeNukem: once you have one you will understand
[08:44:54] <Snane> very true
[08:44:55] <Nece228> hmm need to take a look at it
[08:44:58] <LukeNukem> i had one
[08:45:00] <LukeNukem> she did not bother me
[08:45:00] <LukeNukem> that slut
[08:45:02] <Nece228> heres my index.html btw: http://paste.opensuse.org/86025590
[08:45:19] <jeffsmykil> not that it's a bad thing, just less time to do what you are trying to do
[08:45:32] <Snane> they suck away your time and money
[08:45:37] <LukeNukem> meh, i dont know what i will do with myself once i complete this project
[08:45:41] <LukeNukem> go on a vacation maybe
[08:46:23] <jeffsmykil> learn C#
[08:46:32] <jeffsmykil> or better yet objective c
[08:47:03] <Snane> only girlfriend worth having is one that knows programming =P
[08:47:24] <LukeNukem> I like friends with benefits better -_-
[08:47:30] <xec> Snane: you single too? xD
[08:47:31] <Snane> agreed
[08:47:37] <Snane> Yeah xec
[08:47:46] <jeffsmykil> i had a gf once whos dad worked for sun so i used to send questions to him about my code homework and he would answer me, turns out it was my gf who had no coding experience and was figuring it out her self
[08:47:50] <LukeNukem> jeffsmykil, i will do java, work my way up there you know..Because i gotta build a mobile app for my project
[08:47:58] <ajpiano> ?offtopic your dating habits
[08:47:59] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of your dating habits is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[08:48:00] <Snane> i had a 5 year relation..... totally changed my view on girlfriends
[08:48:15] <LukeNukem> jeffsmykil,  too good to be true
[08:48:26] <jeffsmykil> LukeNukem: Objective C would let you create an iPhone app
[08:48:33] <Nece228> xec: nope
[08:48:36] <LukeNukem> android needs java
[08:48:53] <jeffsmykil> and W7 needs C#
[08:49:04] <jeffsmykil> can you pick the shittiest language out of those three?
[08:49:15] <jeffsmykil> ill give you a hint: it's java
[08:49:49] <xec> based on that hint i'm going to guess.... Objective-C?
[08:49:53] <LukeNukem> android can C#?
[08:50:21] <jeffsmykil> lol xec sorry try again
[08:50:31] <jeffsmykil> android can't C# but the Windows phones do
[08:50:31] <LukeNukem> either ways..im friendzoned most of the time or brozoned
[08:50:34] <xec> jeffsmykil: dammit. i'm not good with hints
[08:50:36] <Nece228> anyone knows how to solve the problem?
[08:50:55] <LukeNukem> plus i look like shit.
[08:50:56] <xec> Nece228: not without more info, anything would be guesses
[08:51:11] <djQuery> they can all html5\javascript
[08:51:23] <Nece228> xec: ok so i will post all three files pastebin
[08:51:27] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: indeed
[08:51:37] <xec> Nece228: i don't see anything wrong with your code, but have no idea what the selectors do
[08:51:43] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: but then if you need a database you have to write the services probably in C#
[08:51:44] <Nece228> index.html: http://paste.opensuse.org/60550613
[08:51:54] <Nece228> search.js: http://paste.opensuse.org/28046428
[08:52:01] <LukeNukem> djQuery, on the browser yes, but i want to build a full on mobile app
[08:52:19] <bzupnick> hey! =)
[08:52:22] <Nece228> the file called livesearch is not important
[08:52:32] <bzupnick> http://pastebin.com/aWV1Ph7g
[08:52:34] <bzupnick> my script isn't running for some reason....
[08:52:49] <bzupnick> all the functions aren't working....but they were before
[08:52:54] <bzupnick> so, idk how i screwed it up, lol
[08:53:09] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, I have ditched windows. I use node.js now
[08:53:15] <Zzaichik> now you done it.
[08:53:35] <xec> Nece228: any errors in console? do you see the http request?
[08:53:37] <jeffsmykil> haven't used it djQuery I get WCF from co-workers and pass json back and forth
[08:53:40] <djQuery> LukeNukem, there are browser methods to take the app off line
[08:53:58] <jeffsmykil> djquery is of course right HTML 5 has some neato features
[08:54:11] <Nece228> xec: no errors
[08:55:02] <LukeNukem> djQuery, do tell me more
[08:55:41] <Nece228> xec: i can re explain just in case. the code works fine, i enter some text in the field, press the blah button and results show up normally below the input field and button, but then when i click on text field, write something else and click blah button again, nothing happens, i still see the old results from previous search.
[08:55:48] <djQuery> LukeNukem, http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/
[08:55:59] <ajpiano> Nece228: if you want someone to actually be able to help you you should provide a live demo of the code failing
[08:56:08] <ajpiano> three static files and a story about them doesn't help anyone debug
[08:56:36] <jeffsmykil> LukeNukem: also http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-offlineweb/
[08:57:25] <xec> Nece228: does a http request happen both clicks?
[08:57:30] <jeffsmykil> man I wish i had time to make an offline mobile app
[08:57:42] <Nece228> ajpiano: ok thats what happened when i typed xbox in search field and pressed the button "blah", seems fine: http://wstaw.org/m/2012/02/29/snapshot9.jpeg
[08:57:48] <LukeNukem> jeffsmykil, djQuery well i need to use php and shit...
[08:57:56] <ajpiano> Nece228: i said live demo, not "screen shot"
[08:58:19] <LukeNukem> Nece228, jsfiddle.net
[08:58:21] <xec> ?demo @ Nece228
[08:58:21] <Nece228> xec: that is the problem i think, it doesnt request when i click on the button second time
[08:58:21] <bot-t> Nece228, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:58:54] <djQuery> LukeNukem, you can make it offline but have it work to your backend whatever it is when they are online
[08:58:56] <xec> Nece228: you can simulate server response at jsfiddle
[08:59:28] <Nece228> thanks im trying now
[08:59:50] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: assuming he has data, we don't know what his app is
[08:59:59] <djQuery> LukeNukem, jeffsmkil: but ajpiano's right these are all off topic
[09:00:29] <LukeNukem> can i pm?
[09:00:43] <djQuery> after you google first
[09:01:04] <LukeNukem> ok
[09:01:14] <Nece228> well i need also to paste php file
[09:01:43] <LukeNukem> Nece228, no..when you make a live demo..load the page(the php will process the shit and make it html) view source, copy the html and paste into html field in jsfiddle
[09:01:54] <LukeNukem> and then the css and javascript code too
[09:02:16] <xec> LukeNukem: his code requres an ajax request to a php page to work
[09:02:40] <LukeNukem> xec, Nece228 use the examples from jsfiddle
[09:02:46] <xec> Nece228: if you look at the left hand menu at jsfiddle.net theres "testing ajax requests" help there
[09:03:06] <LukeNukem> xec, thats what i meant
[09:03:18] <xec> LukeNukem: but it's sure not what you wrote
[09:04:31] <LukeNukem> yeah iknow
[09:06:44] <xec> Nece228: i was bored and made you one http://jsfiddle.net/Mr8Cn/
[09:07:59] <Nece228> xec: thanks because i didnt understand anything at jsfiddle
[09:09:34] <xec> Nece228: i basically copied your code, fixed indentation and made some changes required by jsfiddle, post instead of get and html: as key for the dataz
[09:10:03] <wfq> cannot I do this: $(this).siblings().('.errorlist').hide();?
[09:10:05] <Nece228> xec: and its working in the result, but mine doesnt work
[09:10:31] <wfq> apparently I can do this: $("p").siblings(".selected").css("background", "yellow"); so the line above should be ok
[09:11:01] <xec> wfq: what the hell is .('errorlist')
[09:11:05] <ajpiano> wfq: $(this).siblings(".errorlist")
[09:11:21] <ajpiano> wfq:  jquery has this stupid requirement that you actually write syntactically valid javascript
[09:11:32] <wfq> ahhh I see
[09:11:42] <wfq> thanks guys
[09:13:06] <xec> Nece228: obviously, something else must differ
[09:13:37] <Nece228> xec: i guess could there be something wrong with my php file
[09:13:51] <Nece228> might be offtopic, but if you understand php
[09:14:07] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/6318882
[09:14:15] <xec> i gotta go in a minute, and no, i don't like looking at php, makes me feel dirty inside
[09:14:45] <xec> but. can't. help. myself.
[09:14:50] <xec> waaah
[09:14:56] <djQuery> ajpiano, jquery not being a mind reader and fingering out what we mean can be so annoying sometimes
[09:15:20] <xec> djQuery: lol @ fingering
[09:15:22] <ajpiano> but it feels so good when jquery fingers out exactly what you mean
[09:16:31] <xec> Nece228: what if you make a really simple php page that just returns whatever you send it
[09:17:16] <Nece228> xec: good ide, lemme try
[09:17:21] <Nece228> *idea
[09:17:22] <xec> Nece228: i'm not recommending this for production or anything ;)
[09:17:56] <xec> anyway, good luck, i'm off
[09:18:08] <LukeNukem> Nece228, what issue are you having?
[09:19:20] <Nece228> xec: when i have simple php which just echoes $_GET it works fine
[09:19:29] <Nece228> o why!!111
[09:20:14] <LukeNukem> Nece228, i cant help you without you telling me your issue
[09:20:15] <LukeNukem> o.o
[09:21:37] <Nece228> LukeNukem: the code works fine, i enter some text in the field, press the blah button and results show up normally below the input field and button, but then when i click on text field again, write something else and click blah button again, nothing happens, i still see the old results from previous search.
[09:21:52] <LukeNukem> hmm
[09:21:57] <LukeNukem> you mentioned some $_GET stuff
[09:21:58] <LukeNukem> what was that
[09:22:26] <Nece228> LukeNukem: just echoing what i wrote in the text field
[09:22:28] <Nece228> it works just fine
[09:22:33] <LukeNukem> fiddle link
[09:22:43] <Nece228> but when i want to work my more complex php code it fails
[09:22:52] <griffinjt_> can someone give some help with event binding? I need to bind the conditional logic at the top because it stops working once a user submits a form via ajax: https://gist.github.com/e2c1ecc292255b5745f1
[09:23:05] <griffinjt_> else it works fine, but I'm not sure how to bind a conditional
[09:23:40] <LukeNukem> Nece228, it would be a php issue then?
[09:24:13] <Nece228> LukeNukem: if you know php could you take a look?: http://paste.opensuse.org/54231500
[09:24:59] <LukeNukem> yes i know php
[09:25:00] <Nece228> LukeNukem: im not sure if its something in that php code, because in first time it works fine. keep in mind that it actually echoes results from external website, so perhaps jquery isnt refreshing the way it should
[09:25:50] <LukeNukem> why are you replacing $search = str_replace(" ", "+", $search);
[09:25:54] <LukeNukem> "" with plus?
[09:26:40] <LukeNukem> i take it that you are trying to make a search script?
[09:26:46] <Nece228> LukeNukem: because in url there cant be spaces.
[09:26:56] <Nece228> LukeNukem: yes, im searching from adverts site
[09:27:26] <LukeNukem> Its easier to do an ajax request like so
[09:27:42] <LukeNukem> var term = $("#inputfieldid").val();
[09:28:09] <LukeNukem> oh waait, you are doing it right
[09:29:30] <DreamHazard> ajpiano: thanks for the help bro, I got my code working now :D
[09:31:43] <elb0w> any idea why calling a .click() method would cause an error on IE?
[09:31:46] <elb0w> but not on chrome
[09:31:50] <elb0w> other than it being IE
[09:31:55] <elb0w> IE8
[09:32:23] <Vorspire> standards or quirks mode?
[09:33:47] <elb0w> Vorspire: you mean compatibility mode?
[09:33:59] <elb0w> this is the full command im running, $("#ts").contents().find("iframe[name='DisplayFrame']").contents().find("button[title='Refresh data for this view']").click()
[09:34:40] <Vorspire> ahh, try reversing your quotations, apprently it matters when using pseudo selectors for attributes and such
[09:35:44] <elb0w> ok
[09:35:52] <titii> What mean in animation() effect the toggle value? For example height: 'toggle' ?
[09:36:22] <elb0w> Vorspire: it finds the object though if I alert up to the .click() it gives me [Object object]
[09:36:48] <Vorspire> (titii): it means it will toggle the height, say the natural heigt of the element is 100, it will toggle it to 0, another toggle would take it back to 100
[09:37:10] <Vorspire> elb0w; why use alert? use consol.log :)
[09:38:18] <elb0w> Vorspire: in IE?
[09:38:37] <elb0w> also reversing the quotes faired the same error
[09:38:41] <titii> Vorspire: ok, but can i use it, if initial height is 50, i want to animate to 100 then back to 50? hmmm toggle means the 0? Strange\
[09:38:43] <elb0w> man I hate debugging ie
[09:40:23] <Vorspire> titii; you probably want to use .animate with a collection of css properties to achieve that
[09:41:00] <Vorspire> elb0w; last time I checked, IE was voted the browser with the best development kit/tools, which is very surprising considering the rest of the browser should be abandonware
[09:41:38] <titii> Vorspire: yes, I thought the toggle get me back the initial value, but not? Hmmm what mean toggle value?
[09:42:11] <Vorspire> titii; check the jQuery documentation
[09:42:18] <Vorspire> that's the best I can offer right now
[09:42:50] <jacof> Hi. How can I find the next ul element throughout the siblings ?
[09:43:10] <Vorspire> ?next
[09:43:10] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:43:13] <titii> Vorspire: I do, but there is no written about what it mekes... there is just the value is show hide and toggle
[09:43:34] <jacof> great, thanks
[09:44:09] <Vorspire> titii; are you talking about .toggle() ?
[09:44:47] <titii> Vorspire: nono... i mean $('#...').animate({height: 'toggle'...
[09:47:04] <pow4h> does anyone know how to type the 'start of heading' character, which is ascii for 1?
[09:50:41] <ignite> I have a table and I'm trying to return an array that contains the contents (innerHTML) of each row but excluding the last column. I've tried doing a bar.map() of  a foo.find('table tbody tr').filter(':not(:last-child)') but it returns thie children html element without any way to get the parent (tr).  What would be the way to go about this?
[09:51:27] <wfq> shouldn't the code at the bottom of the file hides the ul list whose class name is 'errorlist'? When I just do $(".errorlist").hide() all the elements with a classname like that are faded away obviously. So why doesn't it work? http://dpaste.com/709497/
[09:52:14] <keirlav87> can anyone suggest any good courses to take to get a better knowledge of programming in general in the UK?
[09:52:49] <tomasm-> hi, are there any decent facebook-like chat plugins for jquery, that I can use in my business (a niche web asp) so I (as an admin) can chat with my customers while we're both "online" (ie logged in and consistently pinging the server)
[09:53:29] <titii> Vorspire: I tried that, it looks, the toggle goes to 0... hmmm strange, maybe not
[09:53:58] <Vorspire> if the starting height before using toggle is > 0, then it will toggle to 0
[09:54:11] <Vorspire> even if the height is 1
[09:54:50] <pow4h> keirlav87 i dont know about UK courses. but did you know youtube has videos on programming? also if there is something you are interested in doing you could use google to find what language is best and specific tutorials
[09:55:36] <wfq> hmm the sibligns() function is not working
[09:56:42] <tomasm-> thats because it's siblings(), not sibligns()
[09:56:59] <pow4h> keirlav87 also if you arent having much luck asking your quesiton in programmign channels you can try job or career channels if IRC has any.  /list
[09:58:07] <elb0w> is there another way to simulate a click other than $("#ts").contents().find("iframe[name='DisplayFrame']").contents().find("button[title='Refresh data for this view']").click() , jquery is erroring with 'nodeName' is null or not an object in IE8
[09:58:21] <keirlav87> i've taught myself quite abit (relative to me that is!) using online tutorials / general reading - I'd just like the more rounded and thorough understanding that you get with a formal learning course, thanks for your suggestions though :)
[09:58:29] <tomasm-> keirlav87, honestly, the best way to learn is to do it on your own. it usually ends up being more practical and rapid that way.... just devise a programming project in your mind, get some books, try some online tutorials, etc and do the research
[09:58:34] <Vorspire> http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html
[09:58:40] <Vorspire> excuse the profanity
[09:58:53] <xec> Vorspire++
[09:59:22] <keirlav87> Vorspire: lol nice link, thanks
[09:59:57] <tomasm-> elb0w, I would suspect that it's not finding it, that you need to trace it back until something is found.... perhaps it's because you're crossing over into an iframe? it's technically a different page, different DOM entirely
[10:01:32] <elb0w> tomasm-: First thing I did, it finds it
[10:01:50] <keirlav87> I work in admin in the minute, and our guys we're using word letter templates to send out customer letters, I made a little php app that will let you put all the variables that need changing on the letter in a form and then that puts them into the letter and prints it for you, found it really satisfying when i got it to work though and would love to get a qualification that would let me do this sorta thing as a career
[10:01:57] <elb0w> everything in [Object object] up until the .click()
[10:02:00] <elb0w> is*
[10:02:37] <wfq> tomasm-, that is one error :) but anyway it does not work at all however if do sibligns().css('background-color'.black) works. Very weird. Java is loaded alwasy after the html is, right?
[10:02:42] <wfq> *javascript
[10:03:29] <tomasm-> elb0w, there may be some ie security issues code-clicking in an iframe, maybe google "jquery iframe click"
[10:03:40] <wfq> same if rather than using the class I use the element type itself
[10:04:12] <wfq> gonna have to use pure javascript at the end :(
[10:11:25] <iamjarvo> for all the chrome dev tools guru is there a way to make the element im inspecting be $(this)
[10:13:11] <johnkpaul> iamjarvo: $0
[10:13:22] <johnkpaul> is the element
[10:13:27] <johnkpaul> so you can do $($0)
[10:14:05] <iamjarvo> johnkpaul:  thanks
[10:14:31] <hdon> hi all :) are there any known gotchas when using .data()?
[10:15:03] <wfq> I should be punished to dead...
[10:16:33] <iamjarvo> johnkpaul:  shouldnt i be able to do $($0).offset() and get the top and left values
[10:16:43] <johnkpaul> yes
[10:16:44] <wfq> ajpiano told me 3 hours ago and I was so blind that I did not see the error
[10:17:02] <ajpiano> i di
[10:17:03] <ajpiano> ?
[10:17:14] <iamjarvo> i am getting this error TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'offset'
[10:17:14] <Jon47> hdon there are some reserved dataset properties.. i think jquery uses "events" for its event binding, for example
[10:17:59] <ajpiano> hdon: also when using the automatic conversion of data- attributes to .data(), strings will be coerced to numbers if possible
[10:18:35] <wfq> yes you did. Time to get some fresh air, frustration is not good.
[10:18:39] <wfq> thanks again guys
[10:18:42] <ajpiano> and sometimes you might not want that to happen
[10:18:56] <ajpiano> wfq no problem, i don't even remember what i told you! congrats!
[10:18:58] <johnkpaul> iamjarvo: are you sure that $ === jQuery?
[10:19:02] <johnkpaul> try jQuery($0)
[10:19:06] <johnkpaul> .offset()
[10:20:12] <iamjarvo> johnkpaul:  thanks. it worked. i guess there was a $ conflict?
[10:20:40] <johnkpaul> iamjarvo: yes, something else on your page is using $ and you probably called jQuery.noConflict() somewhere
[10:21:15] <iamjarvo> johnkpaul:  so does the dev tools inherit from what ever libs you are calling on the page. thats pretty awesome
[10:21:51] <johnkpaul> the dev tools run all javascript in the context of your running page
[10:22:41] <iamjarvo> kk thanks
[10:22:57] <hdon> Jon47: ajpiano: thanks. is it safe to store Objects? do they become serialized?
[10:23:11] <ajpiano> it is indeed safe, and no they do not become serialized
[10:23:19] <hdon> ajpiano: awesome :) thank you
[10:23:22] <ajpiano> hdon: data *is* just an object
[10:23:32] <hdon> ajpiano: i had hoped as much but wasn't 100% certain
[10:23:33] <ajpiano> jQuery.cache is where everything lives
[10:23:51] <hdon> hmm.. how does jQuery avoid memory leaks?
[10:24:22] <ajpiano> very carefully
[10:24:47] <ajpiano> events and data are cleaned up when elements are destroyed, as well
[10:24:49] <Dreamstar> Hi guys, I'm wondering if anyone got an idea how to do a autocomplete search?
[10:24:59] <ajpiano> i have to go to a haircut now, goodbye #jqueriers

[10:25:39] <hdon> ajpiano: awesome :) thanks for the chat
[10:25:58] <BaNzoun3t> Hi guys, I used $("#table").text(tab); to add a table in html page after an action but my problem is that the html code is not "render" I mean I get the whole <table> ... thing instead of the table :( Someone can help me? What did I do wronh?
[10:27:06] <WebDragon> anyone around here used jquery.multiple-bgs.js as opposed to something like PIE.htc to get multiple background images on an item in IE7-8 ?
[10:31:12] <monk12> hey all, quick question. I want a way to submit a form for clicking dynamically created radio buttons... so I do something like: $('input[type=radio]').live('click',function(){ //submitForm });   but i want a way to say for all radio buttons whose <form> parent doesn't have a class="auto-submit". I could check in the click function itself. but was curious if it can be done beforehand in the selector.
[10:31:15] <hdon> WebDragon: i assume something is not working with it?
[10:31:17] <BaNzoun3t> seems that -text +html fixed it ;D
[10:32:28] <monk12> i was thinking something like a .not('form.auto-submit') appended onto the selector... (but that wont work obviously cause you have a handle to the radio buttons at that point i think.)
[10:33:04] <hdon> monk12: you could use .filter
[10:33:26] <ajpiano> monk12: $("form:not(.auto-submit) input[type='radio']")
[10:33:37] <monk12> cool was just looking at :not :)
[10:33:44] <ajpiano> same as css, you separate descendant selectors hierarchicacy
[10:33:45] <monk12> thanks ajpiano
[10:33:46] <ajpiano> cally
[10:33:54] <hdon> monk12: wait, you want to automatically submit the form only if the form does NOT have auto-submit class?
[10:35:49] <ignite> I'm using a plugin that hides rows in a table if any of its contents matches the value of a textbox.  I'm attempting to extend it by excluding the last row (by using :not(:last-child)) but I'm getting unexpected results seen here http://jsfiddle.net/UhTkA/1/  Any ideas what could be wrong?
[10:35:50] <jaha> How would I remove the invisibles(returns,tabs) in a copied JSON string?
[10:36:09] <monk12> hdon: haha, well I phrazed my question bad to make it simpler (and then it doesnt make sense :) ). I actually have a <form> question that ajax-gets the next <form> question. but the next <form> could be a 'super-form' with many radio buttons and text fields in 'one' question... so i wanted a way to selectivly not ajax-auto-submit the current question if it is a super-form (which I'd look for by looking for a selector 'super-form' pretend)
[10:37:02] <hdon> monk12: ah i gotcha ;)
[10:37:23] <monk12> so $("form:not(.super-form) input[type='radio']") would basically work. but on regular questionaiire they want a radio button question to submit the form automatically (without hitting Next button)
[10:37:30] <WebDragon> hdon: pretty much yes
[10:37:33] <ignite> not last row, but last column
[10:37:52] <WebDragon> I haven't actually managed to get a solid multiple-backgrounds test working with either of the two on IE7-8
[10:38:17] <hdon> WebDragon: URL?
[10:38:22] <WebDragon> then again, I've only got IETester to play with, vs IE9+browsermode both of which are flawed in small ways
[10:38:47] <WebDragon> http://360.client-proof.com/home.php -- the multibg's are on the footer and the searchbox
[10:44:54] <WebDragon> hdon: I've been thinking of using this https://github.com/xdissent/ievms over IETester -- just found out about it last night
[10:45:50] <WebDragon> might be more fruitful to get 100% accurate results from the specific IE + Javascript implementations rather than browser-mode or whatever it is that IETester is DoingItWrongâ„¢ with à² _à² 
[10:50:04] <johnkpaul> WebDragon: I use ievms
[10:50:06] <johnkpaul> and I'm a big fan
[10:50:07] <ShadowBelmolve> Whats's the best History plugin?
[10:50:15] <johnkpaul> especially since ie6 came out in deember
[10:52:47] <WebDragon> johnkpaul: yeah I probably wouldn't use the IE6 one much. but it's nice to know it's available
[10:53:39] <pow4h> so if i have a data file full of 1s and 0s, and my posix style read function is returning their ascii number for it, how do get it turn back into 1s and 0s like i wanted? i did vi myfile 123 :wq , then read() storing it to char array[10], and when i printf with array[0] it says 49
[10:53:51] <dualcore> how do you check if a string contains a phrase?  similar to stristr for php
[10:54:50] <jinside> Let's say I embed an external script into my page using the standard <script> tags. How can I then use jQuery to actually store that script's javascript into a variable (so I can place it into LocalStorage) once it's been downloaded?
[10:54:55] <hdon> pow4h: lol wrong channel, but, char c = '0'; printf("%d", c - '0')
[10:55:12] <hdon> dualcore: s.indexOf('phrase')
[10:55:56] <babonk> How can I do an actual POST with query (not an XmlHTTPREquest)?
[10:55:57] <kindness> hi all, i'm trying to run a jquery $.get() call inside of an each loop and append the result to a selected html <option>
[10:56:03] <dualcore> or could you use .index ? http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:56:14] <babonk> *with jquery
[10:56:22] <dualcore> babonk: are you just trying to submit a form with jquery?
[10:56:23] <kindness> i receive data from the server and I can select my option node, but append seems to fail within the jquery $.get() return function
[10:56:24] <Vorspire> hdon doesn't indexOf return -1 for nothing found? 0 would be truthy in this context so checking is essential against != -1 ?
[10:56:48] <kindness> anyone have any ideas why append wouldn't work only within a $.get() call?
[10:56:53] <hdon> Vorspire: yes, though i habitually use >=0 rather than !=-1
[10:57:03] <babonk> dualcore: yes
[10:57:21] <Vorspire> hdon; matter of style I guess
[10:57:43] <dualcore> babonk: http://api.jquery.com/submit/

[11:00:25] <WebDragon> (currently the jquery.multiple-bgs.js is commented out of the markup)
[11:01:25] <hdon> WebDragon: yes sorry
[11:01:45] <hdon> was doing work
[11:02:00] <hdon> WebDragon: which CSS file contains your backgrounds?
[11:02:04] <WebDragon> no worries, I got people around me (near my desk) constantly wanting to talk about personal bullshit while I'm trying to work
[11:02:34] <WebDragon> hdon: should be in style.css -- normalize.css is just that (same thing html5boilerplate uses)
[11:02:36] <kindness> can anyone look at my each loop with a $.get() call in it and tell me what I'm doing wrong? It's about 3 lines of code, so it has to be a stupid mistake, I just can't figure it out
[11:03:30] <hdon> WebDragon: yeah i see i've looked through and found it
[11:03:41] <WebDragon> hdon: I can try re-enabling the jquery-multibackground script on the server if you need me to
[11:04:01] <WebDragon> I was hoping that PIE.htc could solve that, in addition to all the rest that it does
[11:04:28] <kindness> http://pastebin.com/ueWsXYMF
[11:05:09] <hdon> WebDragon: try correcting your background declarations. compare your rules to those here: http://www.chicowebdesign.com/blog/2010/10/21/updated-jquery-multiple-background-plug-in/ that might help
[11:06:05] <hdon> WebDragon: so, url("") REPEAT-DECL X Y
[11:06:16] <WebDragon> hdon: where are they not doing that? that was the thing I tried *first* before falling back to PIE.htc when I realized it did more
[11:06:34] <hdon> WebDragon: but you have url("") X Y REPEAT-DECL
[11:07:03] <WebDragon> hdon: had some interesting issues
[11:07:25] <WebDragon> normally I use url() scroll repeat-N x y;
[11:08:31] <hdon> WebDragon: i don't actually know how this plugin works under the hood when it introspects your CSS rules, so i thought complying with the format given in the example might do the job. have you visited a demo of the plugin with the affected browsers? did it work then?
[11:08:55] <WebDragon> no but that's a great idea and I should have thought of that. I'll do that
[11:09:15] <WebDragon> thanks for the wake-up call =)

[11:10:22] <kindness> can anyone tell me why my append() statement doesn't work within this each() loop? http://pastebin.com/ueWsXYMF
[11:10:48] <WebDragon> hdon: actually most of the multi-bg declarations DO use that format. there was only one line I needed to correct
[11:12:05] <hdon> WebDragon: ah sorry i didn't look any further than the first one.
[11:12:22] <WebDragon> let me re-enable the plugin
[11:12:25] <hdon> im actually being a jerk trying to offer any help that isn't info i know off the top of my head because i'm really focused on work right now :(
[11:13:06] <WebDragon> hopefully it doesn't conflict with PIE
[11:13:39] <WebDragon> yeah I've got that problem compounded by people playing xbox nearby and trying to constantly draw me into conversations about the dang game during working hours
[11:13:51] <WebDragon> doesn't help that it's Fallout either
[11:13:53] <WebDragon> =)
[11:15:07] <dualcore> how come this form wont submit? http://jsfiddle.net/nJUdL/
[11:15:11] <kindness> can anyone please tell me why my append() statement doesn't work within this each() loop? http://pastebin.com/ueWsXYMF
[11:15:23] <dualcore> you can see the alert, but if you uncomment .submit() it doesn't do it
[11:15:47] <kindness> dualcore: the form has no action
[11:16:58] <dualcore> kindness: but i want it to submit to itself
[11:17:53] <dualcore> ive done this before with action="" i'm not sure why it isn't working in this example
[11:18:04] <dualcore> document.forms["form"].submit(); isn't working either
[11:18:51] <kindness> dualcore: what's it supposed to do when it submits?
[11:19:15] <kindness> dualcore: document.getElementById("frm1").submit();
[11:19:18] <kindness> try that
[11:19:26] <dualcore> that is handled separately i just need it to submit
[11:19:28] <dualcore> i wll try
[11:20:09] <kindness> can anyone please tell me why my append() statement doesn't work within this each() loop? http://pastebin.com/ueWsXYMF
[11:20:53] <dualcore> that doesn't seem to be working either http://jsfiddle.net/nJUdL/1/
[11:21:24] <bear2ban> I'm attempting to disable a hyperlink dynamically using jQuery, but setting the onclick attribute to 'return false' doesn't seem to work all the time (and this is an Ajax/dynamic page).  Suggestions as to the best way of disabling hyperlinks (anchors), but still being able to toggle them to be clickable at a later time?
[11:26:09] <Nece228> xec: do you remember me?
[11:26:28] <Nece228> so actually i solved the problem
[11:26:44] <Nece228> i needed to remove line: <base href="http://www.skelbiu.lt/skelbimai/">
[11:27:06] <Nece228> because it prevented from refreshing the page second time
[11:27:11] <Nece228> this is really weird
[11:28:34] <kindness> dualcore: i tried a bunch of stuff, i've got nothing :p
[11:28:49] <dualcore> i know what the heck
[11:28:54] <kindness> it's really weird
[11:28:56] <dualcore> let me try a simpler example
[11:28:59] <kindness> that should work just fine
[11:29:22] <Vorspire> whats the problem?
[11:29:23] <kindness>  can anyone please tell me why my append() statement doesn't work within this each() loop? http://pastebin.com/ueWsXYMF
[11:30:18] <fission6> i want to make an async call for html and inject into #myinject, whats the ideal way to call for html?
[11:31:32] <johnkpaul> ?load
[11:31:33] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:31:44] <bear2ban> fission6: ajax post (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) with dataType html ?
[11:31:52] <fission6> i guess
[11:31:56] <johnkpaul> fission6: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:32:04] <fission6> johnkpaul: interesting let me review
[11:32:19] <fission6> thanks
[11:32:21] <fission6> !
[11:32:22] <johnkpaul> np
[11:33:09] <toxz> hi! how can i get the value of pixels i have scrolled down a page?
[11:34:27] <Vorspire> kindness, can you put up a live demo? http://www.jsfiddle.net
[11:34:39] <Vorspire> I'll help you optimize it
[11:34:56] <initself> I'm posting a new div before every table with a class .tablesorter: http://pgsql.privatepaste.com/619244bba9
[11:35:06] <kindness> sure, I probably can't get it working with the ajax results, though
[11:35:28] <initself> is there a way for me to keep track of how many times i've inserted a new one, ie. how many different .tablesorter tables I have?
[11:35:35] <Vorspire> that's fine, just a simple demo of the big picture is good
[11:35:46] <johnkpaul> ?scrollTop @ toxz
[11:35:46] <bot-t> toxz, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[11:36:28] <toxz> johnkpaul - great
[11:37:35] <Vorspire> initself; just use .length ?
[11:37:50] <initself> .length of what?
[11:37:58] <Vorspire> $('.tablesorter').length
[11:38:09] <kindness> Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/TPJQk/
[11:39:48] <kindness> dualcore: you still here?
[11:40:19] <dualcore> kindness: yes
[11:40:20] <initself> Vorspire: I'm thinking I need to pass that length to onclick="getCSVData()
[11:40:23] <LakWork> if you leave action out entirely it does not work?
[11:40:34] <LakWork> err disregard. i was scrolled up
[11:40:37] <initself> so that the getCSVData knows which table I'm talking about.  does that make sense?
[11:40:38] <Vorspire> kindness; I'm almost certain it's because .append expects HTML or a jQuery object, not just plain text?
[11:40:40] <kindness> dualcore: try changing the name of your submit button to something like "submit2"
[11:40:41] <Vorspire> ?append
[11:40:41] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:41:11] <kindness> Vorspire: I thought that, too, but if I .append() outside of get, it works fine
[11:41:25] <Vorspire> ahh hmm
[11:41:26] <Vorspire> one sec
[11:41:26] <kindness> Vorspire: exact same code outside of the get loop, with a dummy data value works
[11:43:40] <dualcore> kindness: nope
[11:43:51] <Vorspire> ?get
[11:43:51] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:43:52] <kindness> dualcore: damn. google has failed me.
[11:44:46] <Vorspire> kindness, what kind of data is returned by $.get?
[11:45:07] <kindness> Vorpsire: just a number; like 42; not wrapped in html tags
[11:45:38] <Vorspire> k
[11:47:18] <dualcore> can someone please advise on this "error": "Shell form does not validate" - trying to submit this form? http://jsfiddle.net/wBkxZ/
[11:48:51] <kindness> dualcore: give your form a name
[11:50:11] <warrenparsons> dualcore: Why an input type="button" rather than an actual <button> element?
[11:50:11] <Vorspire> kindness; not sure since I can't test properly, but try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/TPJQk/4/
[11:50:27] <Jazo>  I cant make work my irc services. error : ./services: Exec format error. Binary file not executable.
[11:51:01] <Vorspire> Jazo, what's that to do with jQuery? :)
[11:51:14] <kindness> Vorspire: ohh, that might work; lemme check
[11:51:28] <Jazo> i dont know just need help
[11:52:20] <warrenparsons> Jazo: I'd try the #camaroEnthusiasts channel. They're just as likely to be able to help.
[11:53:45] <Stew-a> if i have something like this http://pastebin.com/SmCh79a9 how could i get the value of i at the time of the get request into the success function, the success function inherits the scope just fine as it is but it also inherits the changes to the value of i
[11:54:03] <kindness> Vorspire: that doesn't do it either. sigh
[11:55:33] <kindness> Vorspire: I don't quite get it. If I set up alert() or console.log() statements, I have values for both selected and data, I just can't seem to stick one to the other
[11:55:57] <warrenparsons> kindness: What are you trying to do?
[11:56:09] <bear2ban> How can I disable the click event for hyperlinks with jQuery?  I've tried setting onclick to return false; and I could probably remove the href attr, but I need to preserve the href since this is a dynamic page.  Ideas?  Thanks.
[11:56:17] <JAAulde> Running jQ 1.7.1, UI 1.8.18, is it still necessary to load the bgiframe plugin, or is that stuff accounted for in stuff like UI dialog already?
[11:56:30] <kindness> warrenparsons: make a $.get or $.ajax call within an each loop and append that result of the call to the value of the selected item in the loop
[11:56:36] <warrenparsons> bear2ban: $('a').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[11:56:39] <WebDragon> bear2ban: e.preventDefault()
[11:56:57] <bear2ban> thanks warrenparsons / WebDragon - I'll give it a shot
[11:57:11] <warrenparsons> kindness: Does the append operation happen inside the same loop?
[11:57:23] <kindness> warrenparsons: yes
[11:57:45] <warrenparsons> kindness: Then more than likely you're running into a situation where the append operation is happening before the AJAX call returns its result.
[11:57:53] <warrenparsons> So it has nothing to append.
[11:58:09] <kindness> warrenparsons: i have the append operation within the get call...are you thinking setTimeout()?
[11:58:34] <warrenparsons> kindness: That's one way, but it's fiddly because network latency is somewhat unpredictable.
[11:58:46] <Vorspire> kindness, you can test his theory by adding async: false to the ajaxOptions
[11:58:53] <kindness> warrenparsons: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/TPJQk/
[11:58:58] <warrenparsons> kindness: I've seen patterns for doing it a better way, but don't have them at hand.
[11:58:58] <kindness> Vorspire: yep
[12:00:01] <warrenparsons> kindness: Are the AJAX calls all to the same data source?
[12:00:06] <Vorspire> kindness; that link goes to the old code http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/TPJQk/4/
[12:00:13] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I don't see bgiframe mentioned in the UI dialog docs anymore...is that concern gone?
[12:00:23] <kindness> warrenparsons: yes
[12:00:26] <kindness> Vorspire: thanks
[12:00:36] <imsky> stitches need witches
[12:02:15] <kindness> Vorpsire: !@#$ yeah! async: false did it
[12:02:22] <Vorspire> sweet :D
[12:02:30] <kindness> thanks!
[12:02:54] <Vorspire> warrenparsons++
[12:03:08] <kindness> indeed
[12:03:12] <warrenparsons> kindness: You got it sorted out?
[12:03:22] <kindness> warrenparsons: I do. thanks for the help
[12:03:26] <djQuery> async false is just a hack
[12:03:47] <Vorspire> yeah, just blocks the stack call, useful though
[12:04:03] <kindness> yep
[12:04:18] <warrenparsons> kindness: Good. Just some additional info - When I have to loop through the results of an AJAX request, I usually do the request first, save the results to a var, and then loop through that in one operation. It's usually best for performance to keep what happens inside a loop to a minimum.
[12:04:20] <kindness> blocking calls make my life easy
[12:04:49] <kindness> warrenparsons: I did consider that. probably would've been my next stp. I was gonna load all results into an array and then append them.
[12:04:52] <Vorspire> warrenparsons; in his context he's only using it once anyway, since it's option:selected
[12:05:09] <kindness> that, too
[12:05:15] <Vorspire> but yea, ajax first
[12:05:22] <warrenparsons> kindness: Vorspire Yeah, I came in late to the conversation anyway.
[12:05:23] <Vorspire> is normally best practise
[12:05:42] <kindness> Indeed, I just didn't feel like buffering the ajax data in javascript
[12:05:56] <kindness> mostly b/c I figured there was a lazier way to do it
[12:06:05] <JAAulde> nevermind all my bgifram questions--I forgot that was only for IE6, which we aren't supporting.  woot, removing
[12:10:00] <bear2ban> I need to update production to 1.7 soon ... so instead of .on() and .off(), I was able to use .bind() and .unbind() ... thanks again!
[12:10:44] <kindness> gotta go, thanks again guys
[12:11:37] <AlexMax> I'm trying to use $.getJSON to grab some JSON from a URL.  However, I'm finding out that my queries are all activating the failure callback and I can't figure out why they're simply erroring out.  Doing a .error(function(e) { console.log(e);}) gives me an object with an unhelpful error message...e.status is 0 and e.statText is just "error", no indication of what it found objectionable about the JSON
[12:12:36] <dualcore> i think switching to <input id="save" name="save" value="save" type="button" /> is what fixed it.
[12:13:59] <Vorspire> AlexMax - we need to see some source code or a demo in order to help you effectively
[12:14:13] <Vorspire> http://www.jsfiddle.net
[12:16:06] <AlexMax> Vorspire: Are you sure?  The only sticking point is one function call, and I'd prefer not to reveal the URL being used (though I can answer questions about content types and such).
[12:16:41] <AlexMax> This is literally the extent of the problematic code I'm running into
[12:16:43] <AlexMax> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/HdIcNjinJSJOoFTHvmI4/
[12:16:53] <AlexMax> and it's a 99% copypaste from the documentation
[12:19:57] <AlexMax> I mean...is there a way to get any sort of specific error out of getJSON?
[12:20:27] <AlexMax> Something like a "I was expecting this but got that"
[12:21:55] <Eviltwin> Can you give an example of what you're waiting for?
[12:22:04] <Eviltwin> looking*
[12:24:41] <AlexMax> Eviltwin: Well...all I know is that I'm pointing getJSON at a URL and although it's returning valid json (checking with curl) it does not call the success callback...and if I supply an error callback that does get called.  So getJSON is basically telling me that it's running into an error, but it's not giving me any clues as to what the actual error is.
[12:24:52] <johnkpaul> AlexMax: jsonp or xhr
[12:25:02] <johnkpaul> if it's jsonp, you can't use the normal error callback
[12:25:09] <johnkpaul> you'll have to create your own timeout to check
[12:25:29] <johnkpaul> http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/3442/jsonabort.patch @AlexMax

[12:26:51] <johnkpaul> can you say what the problem you're experiencing is?
[12:27:05] <queztone> well, the class is not being removed when you hover the ul.tabmenu li#office element
[12:27:15] <queztone> class active is not removed
[12:27:23] <queztone> err when you click i mean
[12:27:28] <queztone> err
[12:27:42] <queztone> ok, rephrase, breathe in, breathe out.. :)
[12:28:15] <queztone> i put that onclick on another element, when you click it, it does not remove the class active from the specified element
[12:28:36] <johnkpaul> but there is no error in the javascript console?

[12:29:33] <johnkpaul> there you go
[12:29:41] <johnkpaul> there's no $ on the page
[12:29:42] <queztone> does that mean it can't handle the truth?
[12:30:05] <queztone> does it mean it can't find $('ul.tabmenu li#office') ?

[12:50:34] <lenswipe> hey guys
[12:50:46] <lenswipe> anyone here good with AJAX?
[12:50:58] <xec> mrsd: could you make a quick demo at jsfiddle.net with the relevant markup and working accordion? i'm sure it's possible
[12:51:03] <monk12> lenswipe, what is your ?
[12:51:14] <__composern> http://jsfiddle.net/FFMsX/ <-- sourcehttp://s14.postimage.org/7wgzjsiq8/Screenshot_at_2012_02_29_22_51_04.jpg
[12:51:19] <__composern> problem http://s14.postimage.org/7wgzjsiq8/Screenshot_at_2012_02_29_22_51_04.jpg
[12:51:22] <lenswipe> monk12, im having trouble taking JSON from my server and turning it into a set of HTML elements
[12:51:23] <monk12> everyone here has some knowledge of ajax, im sure someone will answer if you just ask.
[12:52:26] <mrsd> thanks for responding xec: I'll give it a go
[12:52:44] <monk12> does your JSON return html in it or just things youd loop over to create your html like {people: [{name:'Arian',city:'Phila' },{name:'Malone',city:'Chicago'}] }
[12:52:46] <monk12> lenswipe, ^
[12:52:59] <__composern> it must be look like this http://datatables.net/styling/themes  but it isnt
[12:53:00] <lenswipe> monk12, it has some HTML in it like image tags
[12:53:13] <xec> __composern: sry but this is quite useless, put the html in the html field (omit body and anything outside) and actually demonstrate the issue
[12:53:18] <monk12> okay. did you confirm in firebug its returning good data?
[12:53:34] <lenswipe> monk12, im taking the blog from one site and embedding it into another using JSON and AJAX (yes i know i could use server side processing and RSS but im trying to learn AJAX)
[12:53:39] <lenswipe> monk12, sure
[12:53:49] <monk12> like in the JSON sub-tab of the POST/GET request in the Firebug Console tab.
[12:54:04] <monk12> so sure as in the data is good?
[12:54:19] <lenswipe> monk12, well it /was/
[12:54:31] <monk12> so whats the issue? u doing $('#placeToEmbed').html(jsonData.MarkupTag); and not showing up?
[12:54:36] <xec> lenswipe: can you see what the http request returns?
[12:54:41] <__composern> http://jsfiddle.net/FFMsX/1/ here is to html content
[12:54:56] <lenswipe> i was in yesterday and someone started helping me and then left and now chrome developer console just says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL"
[12:55:17] <monk12> probably not escaped correctly or something.
[12:55:41] <xec> __composern: the html field is top left.. where it says "html" ...
[12:56:19] <xec> __composern: it doesnt matter if you spend some time making a demo, we'll wait. just make sure it actually demonstrates your issue
[12:56:46] <__composern> ok
[12:56:48] <__composern> wait plase
[12:57:06] <xec> comment the relevant parts of the code if there are more than say 5 lines
[12:57:17] <lenswipe> monk12, im just looking through my local history to find a verison that isnt broken
[12:57:35] <monk12> lenswipe,  or maybe the returned JSON object properties arent with qoutes? I thought {name: 'Me'} is valid but JSLINT complains even with single qoutes so JSLINT says {"name": "Me"} is valid. Dunno if your library will say its invalid/bad data.
[12:58:17] <monk12> i dunno how various libraries handle that. like are qoutes strict? or like javascript they aren't needed unless property has a space or something. i dunno myself
[12:58:44] <monk12> lenswipe: cool, let us know if find out the issue or get further looking at old code
[12:59:06] <xec> monk12, lenswipe: my money is on "same origin policy" unless you can verify the http request is actually ok
[12:59:08] <lenswipe> monk12, got it
[12:59:16] <monk12> lenswipe, what was it?
[12:59:31] <lenswipe> monk12, no i mean ive found a version that produces json objects in the console
[13:00:06] <monk12> So someone added something that breaks that then? like xec was saying maybe you can check out what the request is actually returning then.
[13:00:27] <lenswipe> monk12, http://jsfiddle.net/sGDLN/
[13:00:43] <lenswipe> so im back to where i have an array of JSON objects
[13:00:58] <lenswipe> i want to take those json objects and from them create 3 divs containing that info
[13:01:28] <__composern> xec: do you have teamviewer ?
[13:01:38] <__composern> i cannot create apache
[13:01:45] <__composern> service
[13:01:50] <xec> __composern: nope
[13:01:53] <__composern> on linux machine
[13:02:02] <lenswipe> __composern, cannot create or cannot start?
[13:02:06] <monk12> lenswipe, can you do something like this is the look: $('body').append('<div>'+ x +'</div>'); to test (if x actually has markup)?
[13:02:08] <__composern> create !
[13:02:19] <monk12> like this in the *loop*
[13:02:20] <lenswipe> monk12, i guess - yeah
[13:02:45] <xec> lenswipe: he's apparently writing his own webserver, this could take some time
[13:02:55] * xec fetches popcorn
[13:03:13] <__composern> i've virtualbox, if you want i can create a virtual os for you
[13:03:22] <xec> __composern: what on earth for
[13:03:23] <__composern> you can connect teamviewer or somethink else
[13:04:51] <xec> __composern: i'm not some support technician hired to help you, if you want free help from fellow developers we expect you to put some effort into it
[13:05:51] <xec> __composern: spend some time learning how jsfiddle works, make a live demo of your issue and you have better chances
[13:07:49] <lenswipe> xec, this sounds like fun
[13:08:24] <lenswipe> xec, any particular reason why hes discussing this in here and not in #httpd or #coding or #programming?
[13:09:24] <xec> lenswipe: he was asking about a jquery plugin earlier, i was thinking he maybe wanted to show what he had through a server
[13:10:21] <mrsd> Ok, I think I've done it... http://jsfiddle.net/GVFBJ/
[13:11:34] <mrsd> so if there is no content then essentially disable that panel and allow the link to go to the named anchor lsewhere in the page
[13:12:26] <KevlarSoul> mrsd how would i know what to click as the user?
[13:12:43] <KevlarSoul> Plus sign minus sign, maybe?
[13:12:59] <KevlarSoul> side arrow down arrow?
[13:13:17] <xec> mrsd: but, all these accordion tabs have content
[13:13:29] <mrsd> I have it with the UI theme on my page... just didn't take the time to add it in here
[13:13:37] <KevlarSoul> oh okay
[13:13:38] <xec> mrsd: how would the markup look like if it did not
[13:13:42] <mrsd> took me long enough to figure out jsfiddle
[13:13:48] <mrsd> never used it before today
[13:13:59] <xec> mrsd, KevlarSoul: added jq ui css http://jsfiddle.net/GVFBJ/1/
[13:14:53] <KevlarSoul> better XD but he said he had it so...
[13:15:15] <KevlarSoul> cant close it without clicking another
[13:15:24] <lenswipe> monk12, now that i have my stuff displaying properly, do you know of a way to animate the filling of the div?
[13:15:36] <xec> KevlarSoul: that is correct, and also not the issue ;)
[13:15:43] <lenswipe> so that the stuff appears to fade in or slide rather than just appear?
[13:16:18] <xec> KevlarSoul: mrsd asked how to make the headers link to some other stuff if there was no content. thing is: there is content under each header
[13:16:47] <xec> so, mrsd: how would the markup look if there was no content - what can we look for
[13:17:49] <monk12> lenswipe, hehe  well google/research the 'jquery effects'
[13:17:54] <lenswipe> hmm
[13:17:59] <monk12> should be the first match googling
[13:18:07] <mrsd> Ok, the link you posted is not what I am looking at as posting in jsfiddle so maybe I am doing something wrong
[13:18:10] <KevlarSoul> .slideUp('slow')
[13:18:30] <KevlarSoul> .slideDown('slow')
[13:18:32] <mrsd> http://jsfiddle.net/GVFBJ/2/
[13:18:37] <mrsd> try that
[13:18:48] <monk12> Yyou can see examples of each on jquery's page. most are named appropriately
[13:19:00] <xec> ok, womens issues is empty, lets have a go
[13:19:13] <mrsd> I apologize, my first time using it
[13:19:50] <mrsd> thank you xec for being patient with me
[13:22:19] <KevlarSoul> remove the panel and give it a link?
[13:26:02] <mrsd> I've found that the links are disabled if the accordion is functioning so it makes more sense to me to add the alternate function of the link if the panel is empty and default to the alternate link being disable if the panel contains content don't you tink?
[13:27:00] <KevlarSoul> interesting
[13:27:05] <mrsd> plus if I remove the panel and simply make it a link wont I lose the theme appearance?
[13:27:48] <xec> mrsd: sorry, i don't know a good way to do what you want. but you might be able to make a hack, there is an event called changestart - you could check if the newContent contains any text and then scroll to something - if thats what you meant with anchor. this is my start; http://jsfiddle.net/GVFBJ/3/
[13:28:20] <xec> it should now alert "empty" every time you click an empti accordion tab
[13:29:06] <dualcore> how would you check if a string contains @
[13:29:35] <xec> dualcore: indexOf()
[13:29:45] <KevlarSoul> define a different panel?
[13:29:51] <KevlarSoul> .PanelEmpty
[13:30:08] <KevlarSoul> Make it small and just contain the link?
[13:30:28] <xec> dualcore: if ("do i have a @ in me".indexOf("@") > -1) { ... }
[13:30:32] <KevlarSoul> OR
[13:30:42] <KevlarSoul> Why do you have women's issues in the accordion at all, remove it.
[13:30:47] <KevlarSoul> put it back in with content
[13:30:48] <KevlarSoul> when you get it
[13:31:29] <KevlarSoul> Just make it a "button" above mens health they wont know the difference.
[13:32:19] <xec> KevlarSoul: i'm guessing the content of the accordion is dynamic in nature
[13:32:43] <KevlarSoul> ahh so he want the structure to be there for when he fills his db?
[13:32:59] <KevlarSoul> I still say remove it and do a faux accordion button...
[13:33:13] <KevlarSoul> :D
[13:33:16] <mrsd> thanks xec, I was able to find that much of a solution by way of google... I can get an alert to popup but can figure out how to make the link behave as a link
[13:33:40] <xec> mrsd: you can't - but you can simulate it
[13:33:50] <mrsd> yes, kevlar, trying to maintain structure
[13:33:53] <KevlarSoul> work around accordion , meh. User wont know.
[13:34:00] <xec> mrsd: by getting the href value, looking for a matching ID and scroll there
[13:34:57] <xec> like i said, it will be a hack though. KevlarSoul's idea of simply not using an accordion might be more feasible ;)
[13:34:58] <mrsd> xec: sounds promising but may be beyond me
[13:37:10] <xec> mrsd: do you understand what I did so far? the newcontent and ui and changestart?
[13:37:16] <KevlarSoul> just create the backend empty structure, when you have content remove the faux button and write the html to match it
[13:37:32] <KevlarSoul> or whatever
[13:37:48] <KevlarSoul> you'd be done by now :D
[13:39:01] <KevlarSoul> or ask other rooms, there may be a way to get it to act as a link
[13:39:17] <KevlarSoul> the rabbit hole is deep enough to play in all afternoon!
[13:40:39] <mrsd> a little but not entirely, like I said, pretty much a newbie
[13:40:59] <KevlarSoul> hey me too! That's why my solution is basically "f-it! move on!"
[13:41:03] <KevlarSoul> thats a newbie response :D
[13:42:47] <mrsd> I'm trying to learn but learning on the fly
[13:43:08] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[13:43:08] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:46:11] <xec> mrsd: http://jsfiddle.net/GVFBJ/7/
[13:47:19] <xec> mrsd: like i said, this is a hack, and assumes that there will be a link in every header, and that links href will contain the name of an ID of an element elsewhere
[13:48:25] <xec> mrsd: also, i'm not sure how cross browser the .trim() method is
[13:48:50] <mrsd> ok, ok, now we're getting somewhere!
[13:50:35] <xec> mrsd: i don't use jquery ui personally, just found the changestart event at http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ - so i don't know if you can prevent the empty accordion tab from opening
[13:51:46] <xec> mrsd: looks like IE<9 doesn't support the .trim() i used - you can find a shim here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim
[13:53:31] <mrsd> it is causing some undesirable effects with the other accordion tabs but atleast it gives me something to start with and work from. Better than the alert box popping up... THANKS!
[14:04:21] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best syntax to get teh font size of an element in js
[14:04:23] <jeffreylevesque> or jquery?
[14:05:26] <Eviltwin> jeffreylevesque: I'm not sure there's a good way to do that
[14:11:37] <diverdude> can i search for different classes in a single select?
[14:11:50] <diverdude> like $('.class1 or class2')
[14:12:02] <xec> diverdude: yes, use a comma
[14:12:11] <diverdude> thx
[14:12:40] <xec> $(".class1, .class2") will select any element with either class
[14:12:53] <xec> $(".class1.class2") will select any element with both classes present
[14:13:04] <xec> in case that's what you meant
[14:13:25] <ollierattue> Hey
[14:13:48] <ollierattue> $('#profile').find('.browserItemLink').click(function(event) { - how do I blind another selector to that event?
[14:14:02] <diverdude> xec: thx for info
[14:14:06] <ollierattue> $('.profileEventButton').click
[14:15:32] <monk12> hmmmm using jquery 1.7.1 and css/js Foundation library together... in  user's browser IE8, i see an error where a selector is $('.nav-bar li a, .nav-bar li a:after') ... the error is  Syntax error, unrecognized expression: after  jquery-1.7.1.js, line 4179 character 2.
[14:15:44] <monk12> just curious if anyone has witnessed selectors crashing in older browsers.
[14:15:45] <xec> ollierattue: if you have a recent jQuery version, you should use .on() - for instance $("#profile").on("click", ".browserItemLink, .profileEventButton", function(){...});
[14:16:15] <monk12> i saw something about jquery/Sizzle errors if you use attribute selectors without quotes... but that is an :after
[14:17:06] <xec> monk12: i don't think you can access pseudo elements (generated css content) with javascript that easily, unfortunately
[14:17:40] <xec> monk12: such as :after and :before
[14:17:47] <monk12> In otherwords the :after jquery implemention could be iffy in older browsers?
[14:17:47] <ollierattue> xec: thanks
[14:17:52] <monk12> xec^
[14:18:06] <xec> monk12: i didn't think there was one?
[14:18:34] <ifnspifn> Hiya. Quick question about .append() and performance...
[14:18:36] <xec> monk12: but it shouldnt throw a syntax error either
[14:18:44] <monk12> xec, hmmmm, interesting i'll research. I thought it would work since newer browsers dont error when that js file comes up.
[14:18:58] <monk12> i dont even use their nav drop downs. i could comment it out... but jsut curious why errored
[14:19:27] <ifnspifn> if I have, let's say, 300 individual dropdown select boxes, all with class ".thisClass", and I want to append an <option> to all of them
[14:19:39] <ifnspifn> how might I do it without spinning the browser for about 10 seconds?
[14:20:17] <ifnspifn> They all need to carry their own unique selected option, which is why I have them all as individual DOM elements. Is there a better way to do this?
[14:22:50] <monk12> xec, looks like u right. Couple websites say the explicit css selector :after doesnt work. Thanks. found a bug in Foundation code :)
[14:30:09] <bartmax> how to write this in jQuery? : if $element is child of $otherelement ?
[14:30:11] <Zzaichik> sphincter. That is all
[14:30:18] <bartmax> $otherelement.has($element) ?
[14:30:46] <bartmax> $otherelemenet.childrens($element).length ?
[14:31:16] <Zzaichik> if($('#element').has('childElement'))
[14:31:39] <bartmax> ty Zzaichik
[14:31:59] <Zzaichik> yeeeeeeeep
[14:32:13] <bartmax> sure ?
[14:32:19] <rasmusth> Hey guys, I am having an IE7 specific problem. I load a div with ajax when clicking a link, and then when clicking another link the div is shown in a fancybox. However in IE7 I get an error as if it cannot find that div. You can see it live here: http://realen.dk/drupal/
[14:32:30] <Zzaichik> are you asking me if I"m sure?
[14:32:36] <Zzaichik> negative.
[14:32:39] <bartmax> Zzaichik: :D
[14:32:44] <Zzaichik> ;p;
[14:32:46] <Zzaichik> lol
[14:35:20] <ifnspifn> Perhaps my question at 17:33 would be better placed in an HTML-oriented channel?
[14:36:33] <initself> http://pgsql.privatepaste.com/619244bba9
[14:36:48] <initself> how can i get "which" .tablesorter I inserted before?
[14:37:22] <initself> Vorspire said try .length, but I don't know how to modify my syntax to 'save' that value anywhere.
[14:46:28] <initself> .length gets me a value of two.  I guess now I can just loop through child elements by nuber?
[14:46:31] <initself> nubmer?
[14:47:52] <initself> or maybe i need :eq()

[15:00:00] <someprimetime> any idea why?
[15:03:00] <w00tzer> Hi guys, can you please help me ?
[15:04:11] <Zzaichik> possibly..
[15:04:40] <someprimetime> is it possible to clone a div by adding parameters to it?
[15:09:18] <w00tzer> Im trying to disable Fancybox in certaing links
[15:09:31] <stones_> Hi. Has anyone here ever installed JQzoom? Im having a bit of trouble getting it setup as I am not familiar with setting up Jquery scripts
[15:09:45] <w00tzer> Buy i guess "<a " is binded to all links so it makes it impossible
[15:10:31] <w00tzer> I have been reading a lot and i found this possible fix:   $("a").fancybox();
[15:10:40] <w00tzer> But i cant find it anywhere
[15:10:46] <coldhead> you'll do fine, stones_. can you be more specific about your problem?
[15:11:51] <stones_> Thank you coldhead, I appreciate your response buddy :)
[15:12:14] <stones_> I am sure if I learn now how to load a script I can load other scripts myself in the future.
[15:12:32] <stones_> coldhead Here is the script i am trying to implement into my online shop with Shopify: http://www.mind-projects.it/projects/jqzoom/index.php
[15:12:44] <stones_> It has instructions there and I followed them but I am not sure if I am placing it in the right place
[15:12:44] <coldhead> oh god, shopify
[15:12:49] <stones_> I know :x
[15:12:51] <coldhead> jQuery is the least of your problems
[15:12:55] <stones_> hehe
[15:13:11] <coldhead> do you have your attempt online somewhere?
[15:13:28] <stones_> hmmm yeah
[15:13:33] <stones_> Could I shoot you a PM?
[15:13:38] <coldhead> if you must
[15:13:45] <stones_> Yep, site is password protected
[15:13:45] <w00tzer> http://cuponaria.com/#cp_restas
[15:14:39] <w00tzer> i dont want the images to open with fancybox... can you give me a tip or something???
[15:14:47] <w00tzer> how to disable it?
[15:16:46] <w00tzer> anyone ??
[15:17:55] <Joe_S> you could do something like this: $("a:not(.nofancybox)").fancybox();
[15:18:28] <tetradon> I'm using .prepend to add a div as the 1st child of a parent div. I have an onclick event set up for the newly added element, but when I click on the element it doesn't work. However if I refresh the page it does work.
[15:18:33] <tetradon> What am I doing wrong here?
[15:18:49] <tetradon> Is there something other than .prepend that adds an element to the DOM?
[15:19:03] <Joe_S> and then apply class="nofancybox" to any link you want to disable fancybox on
[15:19:35] <w00tzer> Thanks for the response
[15:19:47] <Joe_S> your welcome :)
[15:19:53] <w00tzer> that must be inside $(document).ready(function(){  ????
[15:19:59] <Joe_S> yes
[15:20:11] <w00tzer> Let me try it
[15:21:09] <w00tzer> And how do i set the link id=#nofancybox# ??
[15:21:09] <w00tzer> And how do i set the link id=#nofancybox ??
[15:21:52] <Joe_S> <a class="nofancybox" href="#">link</a>
[15:22:36] <izepstan> hi, hello there, can someone of you tell me if there is a method to get the last selected in a radiobuttonlist if new one is selected?
[15:23:14] <nFFF> Was just looking for first time at all the jqueyr plugins
[15:23:19] <nFFF> its pretty fucking crazy
[15:23:26] <nFFF> theres some really cool plugins
[15:23:44] <JonnyCash> anyone know a good/fun/hip writer looking for some side work?
[15:23:46] <eddiemonge> izepstan: you would need to set a variable to store it
[15:23:46] <nFFF> you pretty much don't even need to be able to code to make some pretty cool sites :>
[15:23:47] <stones_> has anyone ever install JqZOOM?
[15:24:07] <izepstan> eddiemonge: go on..
[15:24:35] <eddiemonge> tetradon: how are you doing the click event?
[15:24:46] <tetradon> eddiemonge: .click
[15:24:53] <w00tzer> Joe_S Can I PM you ?
[15:24:56] <eddiemonge> izepstan: that was it. when you select the element, add it to a variable and then you can reference that later on
[15:24:58] <Joe_S> Sure
[15:25:08] <eddiemonge> tetradon: are you delegating it? new element or moved element?
[15:25:36] <tetradon> eddiemonge: new element
[15:26:05] <izepstan> eddiemonge: ok, and run first a .each to get the default selected, cause its not first element..
[15:26:18] <izepstan> got that.. thx..
[15:27:13] <eddiemonge> ?delegation @ tetradon
[15:27:13] <bot-t> tetradon, If you try to attach an event to an element that doesn't exist in the DOM yet, it will not bind. You need to delegate the event handler to a parent that is in the DOM to look for its children.
[15:28:00] <eddiemonge> izepstan: no. just use see ? selected
[15:28:00] <bot-t> izepstan, :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[15:28:18] <tetradon> eddiemonge: Thanks. That makes sense.
[15:28:32] <izepstan> even better.. great..
[15:44:42] <lionmac> i have two slideshows in a page ... they both use jQuery(function($) .... at the moment the first slideshow uses jquery the second stops
[15:45:20] <someprimetime> i wrote a plugin that restricts submitting a form until 2 input fields are filled outâ€¦ i'm also cloning these forms so the plugin should need to apply to the new clones
[15:45:20] <eddiemonge> ?Demo @ lionmac
[15:45:21] <bot-t> lionmac, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:45:31] <someprimetime> is there an easy way to do this with my plugin?
[15:45:43] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: yeah call it after the clone
[15:45:44] <someprimetime> would i need to delegate the declaration of the plugin itself?
[15:45:44] <someprimetime> or
[15:45:52] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: or deep clone
[15:46:58] <someprimetime> oh eddiemonge
[15:47:00] <someprimetime> oh you

[15:49:32] <citizenkeys> $('#myId').html().replace("some text",""); <-- how do i make that work?

[15:51:39] <eddiemonge> citizenkeys: how doesnt it work?
[15:55:28] <citizenkeys> it's not doing the replace.

[15:56:33] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: I think .html() might return a copy of the .innerHTML and not the original .innerHTML
[15:56:35] <Eviltwin> Maybe?
[15:57:17] <eddiemonge> citizenkeys: http://jsfiddle.net/TPaLR/
[15:57:29] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: works just fine for me
[15:57:37] <Eviltwin> Oh, right, .replace() performs the replace on a copy
[15:57:55] <Eviltwin> I think his goal was to actually modify the HTML of that element directly
[15:58:40] <eddiemonge> then maybe citizenkeys should state that? i see a var that says myNewText but no reference what that is for
[15:58:49] <lenswipe> hey guys
[15:58:59] <citizenkeys> i'm creating a variable.  i need to get the id's innerhtml and replace part of it.
[15:59:22] <lenswipe> is there a way for jquery.ajax to get the HTTP status code like 404 - Not Found instead of just "error - not found" ?
[15:59:51] <eddiemonge> citizenkeys: ok then your code works. if it doesnt, you have something else going on in your page breaking it
[16:00:19] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: did you read the docs for ajax?
[16:00:25] <eddiemonge> ?ajax.error
[16:00:27] <bot-t> eddiemonge, .ajaxError() - Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete with an error. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[16:00:29] <lenswipe> im reading them right now
[16:00:47] <danheberden> lenswipe: the status is also on the jqXHR
[16:01:12] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/
[16:01:20] <lenswipe> $('#json').append('<div style="display:block; clear:both;"><h6 class="center alert-block">Unable To Load Content: ' + status + ' - ' + error + '</h6></div>');
[16:01:31] <lenswipe> right now the "status" in there just shows "error"
[16:01:41] <lenswipe> i want it to show the actual status code like 404 or 403 or whatever
[16:02:50] <danheberden> lenswipe http://jsfiddle.net/SQNTn/
[16:02:56] <ndss56> lenswipe: its there. read the doc.
[16:03:03] <lenswipe> ndss56, im reading it
[16:03:13] <lenswipe> danheberden, is that all?
[16:03:15] <lenswipe> wow, cool
[16:03:25] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: run this code: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/1/
[16:03:34] <citizenkeys> problem was apparently the original string to be replaced was not exactly correct.
[16:03:43] <citizenkeys> which is why nothing was being replaced .  :-)
[16:04:05] <eddiemonge> citizenkeys: kind of figured that might be the problem
[16:04:20] <eddiemonge> hard to tell without demos or examples though but glad you got it worked out
[16:05:55] <lenswipe> thats it! :D
[16:05:55] <lenswipe> ' + jqXHR.status + ' - ' + status + '
[16:06:04] <lenswipe> thanks eddiemonge, danand ndss56
[16:10:45] <lionmac> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[16:10:46] <lionmac> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:10:52] <lionmac> what are these error
[16:11:10] <lionmac> i got a working slider and put it into my html page and it want work
[16:11:35] <ndss56> what is jQuery(edge)?
[16:11:45] <eddiemonge> bot-t: tell lenswipe your code could be cleaned up greatly. heres a start: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/2/ learn about jQuery chaining and not appending in loops and lots of appends as it causes a reflow on each append
[16:11:46] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Okay.
[16:12:07] <eddiemonge> lionmac: you arent including jQuery on the page
[16:12:18] <lionmac> but it is there
[16:12:23] <ndss56> eddiemonge: lenswipe is not here anymore :)
[16:12:25] <eddiemonge> ndss56: what do you mean?
[16:12:38] <eddiemonge> ndss56: thats why i told bot-t to tell him when he gets back
[16:12:41] <eddiemonge> and he will be back
[16:12:42] <lionmac> the other slideshow works which is a different code ... i have two in one page
[16:12:52] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ lionmac
[16:12:52] <bot-t> lionmac, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:12:53] <eddiemonge> or a link
[16:12:59] <ndss56> eddiemonge: ahhh... didnt't know you can do that. cool
[16:13:28] <eddiemonge> ndss56: jquery(edge) is the latest git built version
[16:14:06] <ndss56> eddiemonge: an in unofficial release?
[16:15:04] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[16:15:11] <Blaster> if you had 2 radio input boxes, how could you get the index of the one selected?
[16:15:29] <ndss56> Blaster: $(this)
[16:15:51] <someprimetime> how come when i clone some of my divs they are like at 10% opacity?
[16:15:55] <someprimetime> of the original
[16:16:15] <eddiemonge> Blaster: $("radio:selected").index()
[16:16:34] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: because thats the style applied to them?
[16:16:58] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: nah i mean some of them will look fine, but if it's like 10 clones the last couple will be way lighter
[16:16:59] <someprimetime> it's weird
[16:17:25] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: are they on top of each other or something. you should pretty much know what im going to ask for by now
[16:17:40] <someprimetime> haha word *goes to jsfiddle*
[16:17:40] <someprimetime> t
[16:17:45] <someprimetime> they aren't on top of each other though
[16:17:49] <someprimetime> that's the first thing i thought
[16:20:59] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: hmm
[16:20:59] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/bcFJ7/1/
[16:21:00] <someprimetime> weird
[16:21:02] <someprimetime> works fine there
[16:21:06] <someprimetime> must be some shit in the css
[16:24:51] <someprimetime> weird i think it's an id issue
[16:25:49] <eddiemonge> because your id's are numbers?

[16:55:38] <Emn1ty> So... anyone know why this isn't removing the hider class from the parent div? http://jsfiddle.net/FU5r8/3/
[16:56:22] <Carlitta87> how can i use j\key press up to seperate numbers in an input field like a contact number?
[16:56:31] <mordof> Emn1ty: 'this' <-- wrong
[16:57:03] <mordof> this   isn't a string selector, but rather the context - an object
[16:57:09] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: you know $rowId only returns one thing right?
[16:57:24] <eddiemonge> mordof: huh?
[16:57:29] <Emn1ty> eddie: yes, thats the point.
[16:57:45] <mordof> eddiemonge: he's got $('this') .. that's wrong
[16:57:57] <mordof> this is the context, not a string
[16:58:05] <Emn1ty> ah
[16:58:28] <eddiemonge> mordof: that makes more sense. nice catch
[16:58:58] <whoisthis> mordof: where exactly in Firebug can I check which line of script is at fault? If a script is broken, I don't even see it on the list of loaded .js files
[16:59:10] <Emn1ty> mordof: darn quotes :|
[16:59:13] <Emn1ty> thanks
[16:59:25] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: you are also creating global vars everywhere
[16:59:29] <mordof> Emn1ty: also, you're alternating between $(this) and $this (already having saved the selector object)

[16:59:38] <bot-t> whoisthis, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:59:42] <whoisthis> eddiemonge: that's great, but I'd rather have something that doesn't require copy/pasting
[16:59:51] <mordof> eddiemonge: .... creating global variables?
[16:59:56] <whoisthis> eddiemonge: I'll read that, thanks
[17:00:19] <mordof> eddiemonge: those aren't created as global variables. it does pose a problem though if those names already exist in the parent scope
[17:00:36] <Emn1ty> mordof: Actually, $this is in relation to the current foreach loop while $this is the element clicked.
[17:00:44] <eddiemonge> mordof: they are
[17:00:56] <Emn1ty> $(this) is in relation to the loop
[17:01:10] <whoisthis> ah, console...didn't think of it
[17:01:11] * whoisthis silly
[17:01:24] <mordof> Emn1ty: line 3: $this=$(this);  line 5: $parentId= $(this)
[17:01:29] <darrellf> okay here is a sample page... if you select add new address from the drop down you will see an alert of the data returned - and on IE 6 you will see only part of that data get into the page
[17:01:33] <darrellf> https://secure.vortalgroup.com/police/auction5/testlayout.php
[17:01:37] <Emn1ty> yeah
[17:02:18] <mordof> Emn1ty: they're the same thing, except you've already stored it in a variable. may as well use the variable
[17:02:36] <Emn1ty> mordof: yeah noticed that
[17:02:45] <y3di> is there a general web dev channel
[17:02:50] <mordof> >> function blah(){  test = "rawr"; }(); blah();  test;

[17:03:40] <eddiemonge> mordof: click the header
[17:04:22] <mordof> hm
[17:05:12] <Emn1ty> well, i'm a PHP user so I'm fairly good at keeping my naming conventions in sync :P
[17:05:53] <mordof> eddiemonge: is that the same with defining functions as well?
[17:06:05] <eddiemonge> mordof: no
[17:06:26] <eddiemonge> functions created in another function, unless defined before that parent function, are locally scoped to that function
[17:06:40] <mordof> kk, thought so but just wanted to make sure, heh
[17:06:54] <mordof> man that'[s really disappointing that it's actually CREATED in global scope for variables
[17:07:23] <Eruadan> Hi, i have some knowledge of javascript and now i'm looking into jquery as a first lib to work with. I like jquery because it seems closer to what i already do,html/css. I was wondering, how long would take for me to be coe a "jquery" ninja? Also, i was thinking...If i focus only on writting custom jquery code(and not learning other js libs) how would be the job offers? I don't want to be learning thousands of libs before i start working...
[17:07:29] <darrellf> so i should add a prevent default after my load?
[17:08:22] <mordof> Eruadan: it depends on your level of knowledge with javascript to become a "jquery ninja" so to speak
[17:08:40] <mordof> Eruadan: in respect to amount of time taken, i mean
[17:08:43] <coldhead> i'd rather be a jQuery taoist
[17:08:51] <eddiemonge> darrellf: no, i saw $(a).click(function() { return false; }); thats what preventDefault is for. dont use return false unless you understand all the implications
[17:09:10] <mordof> eddiemonge: the implications being..?
[17:09:13] <eddiemonge> coldhead: some day you might be. not on your first day though
[17:10:07] <coldhead> i'll keep trying, thanks for the encouragement mr monge!
[17:10:43] <mordof> Eruadan: personally I would suggest you acquire more than "some" knowledge of javascript before moving into a library and just focusing on that library.
[17:10:47] <eddiemonge> mordof: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357118/event-preventdefault-vs-return-false
[17:10:54] <Eruadan> mm, i know javascript well, i think. I mean, the basis. All the basics.I know how to use llops, and if statments. I also know how to work with objects and constructors. i know how to use prototype to chain constructors, etc
[17:11:12] <mordof> Eruadan: what about closures?
[17:11:15] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: do you know how to work with the DOM?
[17:11:26] <Eruadan> yes, i know anonymous functions also
[17:11:55] <Eruadan> and scope/closures
[17:12:04] <Eruadan> the DOM i don't know much
[17:12:18] <Eruadan> that is where i' steeping into now
[17:12:21] <Eruadan> the DOM
[17:13:40] <Eruadan> mordof, what do think?
[17:13:45] <Eruadan> do you*
[17:14:04] <mordof> Eruadan: when I learned js, i refused to jump to jquery until I could handle everything with plain js
[17:14:10] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ Eruadan
[17:14:12] <bot-t> Eruadan, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[17:14:22] <eddiemonge> or read rmurphey ebook
[17:14:51] <mordof> Eruadan: and even now I only use jquery when it suits the purpose. there are a number of times where using jquery is a bad idea
[17:15:08] <Eruadan> such as?
[17:15:24] <mordof> Eruadan: performance intensive applications for one.
[17:15:24] <KevlarSoul> like when javascript is simpler?
[17:15:28] <mordof> that too
[17:15:37] <Eruadan> sure, then you need backbone ;)
[17:15:43] <mordof> backbone...?
[17:15:59] <mordof> when i need performance i don't use any libraries and do it with plain js
[17:16:05] <Eruadan> backbone for intensive apps
[17:16:14] <Eruadan> ohh, ok, plain js
[17:16:37] <mordof> backbone... *looks into it*
[17:17:08] <Eruadan> mordof, when you build those intensive apps, are they CRUD based?
[17:17:16] <mordof> what is CRUD?
[17:18:09] <Eruadan> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete
[17:18:45] <mordof> Eruadan: why would something to do with persistant storage be used with an intensive app?
[17:19:09] <Blaster> Hey guys!  I had a good sleep last night and I'm feeling very RESTful today!
[17:19:28] <Eruadan> mm, i'm sry, i think i don't understand what you mean by intensive app :(
[17:19:36] <mordof> Eruadan: performance wise
[17:19:45] <mordof> Eruadan: something that requires a lot of speed
[17:20:10] <Eruadan> mm, nice..i would like to see an example of such app
[17:20:12] <y3di> Blaster: ha...
[17:20:19] <mordof> Eruadan: sec, i have one ready for times like these, lol
[17:20:26] <Eruadan> ok, :)
[17:20:52] <Eruadan> source code also?lol
[17:21:02] <mordof> Eruadan: it's client side
[17:21:10] <Eruadan> k, cool
[17:22:26] <mordof> Eruadan: http://mike.orenjidesigns.com/brain/   it's a variation of Brian's Brain - we were going to make a multiplayer version... so there are some different rules added
[17:23:59] <mordof> that's the smoothest i got it before i had to start on different projects in terms of optimization - handling a 500x500 grid (before i found out about the hashlife algorithm)
[17:24:19] <mordof> though the canvas drawing itself becomes a bottleneck, i hadn't optimized that yet either xD
[17:24:22] <Eruadan> very nice :)
[17:24:38] <mordof> it's not buffered.. so that probably plays a huge part
[17:25:26] <Eruadan> mordof, that is exact the kinda of stuff i would like to  learn. I like js, but i hate CRUD apps
[17:25:38] <Eruadan> i found them boring
[17:25:57] <mordof> Eruadan: anyway, there's still a lot to be done in terms of optimization.. but if you start trying to throw jquery in there to help with some stuff it'd slow right down. not to mention there's not really much for jquery to do anyway
[17:27:29] <Eruadan> mordof, what would you do to refactor the code to make it faster? ternaries?
[17:27:37] <mordof> ternaries? what?
[17:27:39] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: if you have data at all, you are going to basically be doing nothing but crud
[17:27:42] * mordof doesn't know terminology
[17:28:02] <eddiemonge>  if x then y else z
[17:28:13] <eddiemonge> var hi = true ? 5 : 6;
[17:28:19] <mordof> er..
[17:28:32] <eddiemonge> but that doesnt make it faster than a normal if else statement
[17:28:43] <mordof> yeah, lol.. was gonna say that shouldn't be a speed optimization
[17:29:05] <mordof> Eruadan: there's a couple things
[17:29:34] <mordof> Eruadan: first - since i'm directly modifying pixel data, grabbing the data array for the canvas *should* be faster than using .fillRect(x, y, 1, 1) etc
[17:29:37] <Eruadan> eddiemonge, so i don't want to work with data
[17:29:57] <mordof> Eruadan: second, i'm not using a canvas buffer, but i should be.  third, there's a hashlife algorithm that (unlikely) might be faster than what i'm using now
[17:30:04] <mordof> but i don't know
[17:30:08] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: hate to tell you this, but if you dont want to work with data, programming is not a good choice for you
[17:30:18] <Eruadan> o.O
[17:30:28] <eddiemonge> all programming involves data.
[17:30:33] * mordof nods
[17:30:38] <eddiemonge> even developing games like Halo
[17:30:38] <mordof> and any UI in particular will have lots of it
[17:31:02] <Eruadan> can i just work with jquery animations perhaps
[17:31:08] <mordof> heh
[17:31:23] <mordof> Eruadan: you can't get much work at all doing that
[17:31:32] <mordof> not anything to life off of anyway
[17:31:53] <mordof> Eruadan: jquery animations are like 1% of a job
[17:32:16] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: animations still require data as well
[17:32:20] <Eruadan> whatever, i will keep my css thing, and use my js skills to give some eye candy, that's it
[17:32:23] <eddiemonge> where to start, where to end, how long to run
[17:32:25] <mordof> Eruadan: and most that are doing the rest of the job won't have much trouble setting up basic animations
[17:32:36] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: thats backwards. CSS is the eye candy
[17:32:41] * mordof nods
[17:32:56] <mordof> js is the interactivity
[17:33:04] <mordof> interactiveness?
[17:33:11] <mordof> interactive aspect***
[17:33:15] <Eruadan> yes, of course, css3 all the way, but i just want to do something with my js skill, not sure what yet
[17:33:23] <dman777> hi, i am trying to download the jquery library. when i try to download it, my browser just takes me to a webpage with many functions written/listed. sorry, i am new.
[17:33:47] <mordof> dman777: a couple options. instead of clicking -> right click, save as
[17:34:02] <mordof> dman777: or once it's open, copy and paste all that into a file and name it to match what's presented to you in the URL bar
[17:34:16] <dman777> mordof: ok, thank you
[17:34:28] <mordof> dman777: if you're going the second route, remember to rename the extention or it'll remain .txt (guessing you're on windows)
[17:34:41] <mordof> extension**
[17:35:03] <mordof> Eruadan: the vast majority of paid js work, or web dev in general, will have UI and data handling aspects
[17:35:15] <mordof> Eruadan: there isn't much out there that avoids that
[17:35:38] <mordof> Eruadan: the example i gave you is 99.9% data handling and manipulation
[17:35:44] <dman777> mordof: naw, using gentoo

[17:37:33] <mordof> dman777: don't start with jquery
[17:37:40] <dman777> mordof: what should i start with?
[17:37:47] <mordof> dman777: the language it's written in - javascript
[17:37:53] <Eruadan> mordof, data handling? I just see an animation in that example. what would be the data in there?
[17:38:04] <mordof> dman777: since using jquery means you're using javascript - it's good to know what you're writing in
[17:38:27] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ dman777
[17:38:28] <bot-t> dman777, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[17:38:41] <eddiemonge> "Basic knowledge of JavaScript and the document object model (DOM) is required"
[17:38:45] <mordof> Eruadan: each dot is a data set, and running through each "frame" as you would put it - requires calculating the differences of the data sets and finding out what to change
[17:38:56] <dman777> mordof: ah....ok. it looks like jquery is just pre-written functions for javascript, correct?
[17:39:08] <mordof> dman777: yep, it's all just javascript functions and stuff
[17:39:12] <eddiemonge> dman777: jquery is javascript
[17:39:25] <dilvie> I wish I could have started learning JavaScript with jQuery. I'm not convinced by the "you must learn JavaScript before you learn jQuery" camp.
[17:39:25] <eddiemonge> javascript is not jquery
[17:39:45] <eddiemonge> its the whole square is a rectangle but a rectangle isnt always a square thing
[17:40:02] <mordof> dilvie: oh? so by learning jquery first you understood prototype inheritance and proper complex closure scope?
[17:40:07] <mordof> understand*
[17:40:24] <eddiemonge> yeah sure you can pick up jquery without learning javascript but most of the time the resulting code isnt going to be as good as someone who has a solid understanding of javascript
[17:40:25] <dilvie> I think they can be learned at the same time. jQuery is just a tool. It'd be like learning C and a good library at the same time (which I did in highschool)
[17:40:53] <Eruadan> mordof, but that kinda of data i like, i just don't like those db data, etc..
[17:40:53] <dilvie> mordof: jQuery taught me quite a bit about proper closure scope, actually.
[17:41:02] <dilvie> mordof: and I didn't learn jQuery first.
[17:41:09] <mordof> dilvie: i find the problem is more that most people don't bother to dive in past the top layers jquery provides
[17:41:12] <dilvie> mordof: I wish I had learned them at the same time. =)
[17:41:16] <mordof> maybe not most, but
[17:41:39] <dilvie> mordof: go back and learn machine code, then. =)
[17:41:48] <mordof> Eruadan: I wrote an implementation of indexing for managing that data in a similar way that databases handle data. but it's specific to my data set so that it's incredibly fast in comparison
[17:41:49] <Blaster> will jquery automatically encode spaces in ajax requests?
[17:41:55] <mordof> dilvie: that's different
[17:42:19] <Eruadan> mordof, redis?
[17:42:24] <mordof> redis? what?
[17:42:33] <Eruadan> the db you used for that data
[17:42:36] <mordof> no
[17:42:52] <eddiemonge> Blaster: depends on how you pass them in
[17:42:56] <mordof> Eruadan: like i said, i didn't use any libraries
[17:42:56] <dilvie> mordof: not much. I rarely mess with the bare metal dom methods that jQuery wraps. Learning the DOM that jQuery abstracts is not equivalent to learning JavaScript. =)
[17:43:02] <Eruadan> ahh, ok
[17:43:09] <mordof> Eruadan: i wrote everything specifically in plain javascript for as much optimization as possible. i wrote my own data layer
[17:43:27] <Carlitta87> im using a .validate, i was wondering if in validate i can use mask as well?
[17:43:31] <dilvie> coding with jQuery is still coding with JavaScript.. it just makes life a bit easier (and better, generally).
[17:43:46] <Blaster> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/ZnNraMdB  (see space on line 1)
[17:44:39] <eddiemonge> Blaster: no because you are passing that yourself
[17:44:47] <Carlitta87> *being ignored is no fun
[17:44:55] <mordof> Eruadan: I've written other apps that actually use indexing - an R* Tree.. or was it R+ tree.. i forget
[17:45:18] <Blaster> eddiemonge: So in what scenario would they be automatically encoded?
[17:45:31] <mordof> Carlitta87: wow, a whole minute and 20 seconds. quite a bit of patience you have there
[17:45:34] <eddiemonge> Blaster: pass it in as the data option
[17:45:36] <Eruadan> mordof, nice
[17:45:49] <Carlitta87> lol...ive been in here for 4 hours
[17:45:53] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: your question is very vague
[17:45:57] <Carlitta87> not the first tim eive asked the question
[17:46:03] <dman777> What is the DOM? I can't find an explaniations on it
[17:46:20] <Eruadan> the DOM is the DOM, it's a mistery, lol
[17:46:23] <mordof> ?DOM @ dman777
[17:46:24] <bot-t> dman777, DOM Insertion, Outside - These methods allow us to insert new content outside an existing element. http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-outside/
[17:46:27] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy dom @ dman777
[17:46:28] <bot-t> dman777, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dom
[17:46:28] <mordof> er..
[17:46:30] <Carlitta87> sry.. im trying to use .validate so that an input field can retain the mask 00/00/0000
[17:46:47] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: define .validate
[17:46:48] <Carlitta87> this field is being dynamically prtined
[17:46:49] <Blaster> Still vague
[17:47:13] <Carlitta87> .validate is used with the plugin ....
[17:47:15] <mordof> it seems to be a plugin
[17:47:26] <eddiemonge> mordof: there are a lot of validation plugins
[17:47:37] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: which one?
[17:47:37] <mordof> eddiemonge: ah
[17:47:44] <Carlitta87> ....
[17:48:05] <Carlitta87> theres more than one jquery validation plugin?
[17:48:05] <Eruadan> http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-outside/ this is all i need to know about the DOM? piece of cake, i'm learning jquery right now ;)
[17:48:17] <eddiemonge> yes
[17:48:24] <eddiemonge> there are about a billion jquery plugins
[17:48:27] <mordof> Eruadan: no, ignore that link, lol
[17:48:53] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: read that link i sent to dman
[17:49:22] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: validation is the handling of inputs after an action. not the presentation of the inputs. so masking would be something different
[17:49:34] <Eruadan> i am reading, i posted the same link
[17:49:54] <mordof> Eruadan: that's not the link he sent, that's the one I brought up by mistake
[17:50:04] <dman777> i wanted to learn css also for better graphics. is css meant to be run with javascript or can a webiste be entirely css?
[17:50:17] <mordof> dman777: CSS is meant to Style HTML
[17:50:24] <mordof> dman777: there is no reliance on Javascript
[17:51:57] <Eruadan> the dom https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_DOM_Reference/Introduction#What_is_the_DOM.3F
[17:52:21] <mordof> that works
[17:52:24] <mordof> MDN ftw
[17:53:58] <Funhouse> hey guys, just wondering if you ever use mootools with jquery, or is that just blasphemy?
[17:54:41] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: a quick search pulled up http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[17:55:13] <eddiemonge> dman777: you might want to pick up a book on getting started with web development
[17:56:03] <Carlitta87> eddiemonge: this is wat im using to mask my dob fields.... but there is one set thats its not working with b/c they are dynamically printed
[17:56:14] <Carlitta87> so i wanted to use to jquery to validate it
[17:56:42] <Carlitta87> $('.bday').validate({ //enter code here});
[17:56:54] <Carlitta87> but...i dont know what to put in the middle
[17:57:05] <eddiemonge> Carlitta87: have you read the documentation for that plugin?
[17:57:14] <Carlitta87> yes
[17:57:17] <Eruadan> mordof,any other place to learn the DOM? i remember i found another very good place, but i don't have in my bookmarks. It's something to do with nonja or turtle, not sure
[17:57:20] <dman777> eddiemonge: well, i'm reading up on javascript and its easy so far. i already do bash scripting and c so this isn't unfamilar. but what would be the differnce between placeing <script> java code </script> inside a <body> versus outside of <body>?
[17:57:56] <mordof> Eruadan: sorry, I don't know of any reference off hand. i haven't looked for documents like that in a long time
[17:58:06] <eddiemonge> dman777: an intro to javascript book would cover that. theres a lot of differences
[17:58:26] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy dom @ Eruadan
[17:58:27] <bot-t> Eruadan, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dom
[17:59:01] <dman777> eddiemonge: ya, i'm reading http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/755/JavaScript-For-Beginners and they don't really list the differences
[17:59:20] <eddiemonge> Eviltwin: time for your shift?
[17:59:26] <eddiemonge> dman777: thats why i said book
[18:01:54] <eddiemonge> http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wrox-Programmer/dp/047022780X/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330567211&sr=1-8
[18:02:53] <eddiemonge> updated: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330567350&sr=1-2
[18:05:10] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: My shift's not till this weekend, sorry
[18:05:18] <Eviltwin> Too much to do right now
[18:05:59] <coldhead> :D
[18:06:41] <coldhead> hang in there, evilsy
[18:06:58] <dman777> eddiemonge: ok, looks like i will buy one of those. thanks. would i use css to style javascript?
[18:08:23] <eddiemonge> dman777: read that second book and itll answer your question
[18:09:03] <eddiemonge> this one will answer your css questions http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Definitive-Guide-Eric-Meyer/dp/0596527330/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330567709&sr=1-4
[18:14:01] <dlama_query> ALGUN CHILENO
[18:14:51] <coldhead> Â¿algun chileno que me pueda ayudar?
[18:25:46] <dman777> eddiemonge: do you use cgi?
[18:26:36] <Eruadan> oh, finally i found what i'm into http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design , i would like to use jquery for this
[18:26:59] <eddiemonge> dman777: for what?
[18:27:32] <mordof> Eruadan: there's still a lot of data work to be done there
[18:28:01] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: thats not something you "use jquery for"
[18:28:06] <dman777> eddiemonge: for web pages?
[18:28:20] <eddiemonge> dman777: no. its not 1995 anymore
[18:28:29] <eddiemonge> although php uses cgi somewhat
[18:28:52] <peteyg> What? It's not 1995 anymore? Man... I'm behind the times!
[18:29:02] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy way to make a background color 'blink' (ie toggle between two distinct colors) ? at least until it's 'shut off'
[18:29:05] <dman777> eddiemonge: what has replaced cgi?
[18:29:06] <mordof> i've never used cgi.. not even really sure what it is/used for, lol
[18:29:14] <eddiemonge> PHP fastcgi
[18:29:57] <mordof> tomasm-: sure, but why would yo uwant to?
[18:30:09] <Eruadan> mordof, sure, but it would be towards what i really like, wich is making interactive designs based on the user confort. I see 80% ui's aroud not really nice, or intuitive. I'm good with this, using the desgn
[18:30:29] <tomasm-> mordof, making a custom chat plugin for my ASP support system/forum
[18:30:53] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: thats really design work, not development
[18:31:15] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: setTimeout
[18:31:28] <mordof> i'd use interval for that
[18:32:01] <peteyg> Why not animate()?
[18:32:02] <eddiemonge> ?setinterval
[18:32:02] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[18:32:24] <eddiemonge> you really shouldnt use setinterval for most case
[18:32:28] <tomasm-> yes, i know how to repeat it, i just dont know how to change the bg in the first place
[18:32:36] <eddiemonge> ?css @ tomasm-
[18:32:37] <bot-t> tomasm-, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[18:33:08] <tomasm-> well, what if I wanted it to gradually fade to the color? maybe slow, maybe fast, i dunno
[18:33:35] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: youll need the color plugin then
[18:33:41] <eddiemonge> ?color
[18:33:42] <bot-t> Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[18:34:35] <Eruadan> jquery is very primitive, i'm sure it will fit my designer's needs.
[18:34:43] <mordof> ...
[18:34:53] * mordof staggers
[18:35:03] <bambams> I'm having trouble understanding promises.. :-/
[18:35:08] <Eruadan> no ofences
[18:35:50] <bambams> In particular, we have some really bad code that attempts to fire a handler after n asynchronous processes complete. Can promises be used to simplify that?
[18:35:58] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: you are going about all of this very wrongly-like
[18:36:19] <eddiemonge> bambams: danheberden is your promises guy
[18:36:22] <zduffy> Does anyone know why the printElement does not work well with cufon?
[18:36:40] <eddiemonge> zduffy: say what? jQuery what?
[18:36:51] <zduffy> jqeury.printelement
[18:36:55] <Eruadan> eddiemonge, i think you know so lil about me, to make such assumptions
[18:37:40] <eddiemonge> zduffy: because its not a good plugin or it wasnt written for that?
[18:38:14] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: no, i have a feeling i have pretty good idea. i think you are trying to solve x with y
[18:38:22] <zduffy> I just need to print out part of a webpage on click and I want it to look exactly the same. I don't want the entire page printing out
[18:38:43] <Eruadan> eddiemonge. whatever dude, i have to go
[18:38:49] <eddiemonge> zduffy: media queries perhaps? or media="print" with CSS?
[18:39:01] <mordof> Eruadan: yeah - it's not just him
[18:39:07] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: i didnt mean to offend you.
[18:39:17] <bambams> Hmmm, maybe it just requires thinking about things backwards. :-/ It seems chaining can be accomplished by returning a promise from promise callbacks, so perhaps the inner-most callback needs to start the process going, returning a new promise, which subsequent handlers can use to create new promises... Or something like that.
[18:39:24] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: im just saying you are trying to use jQuery where javascript isnt applicable
[18:39:39] <mordof> Eruadan: wrong tool for the job, basically
[18:39:53] <eddiemonge> bambams: that sounds like its getting complicated.
[18:40:07] <dman777> eddiemonge: from what i read, cgi is just some kind of interface that allows the perl interpreter and perl scripts to run. The example I read was using cgi and perl to run a form and place the information in a array. Can javascript do the same thing with a form?
[18:40:18] <zduffy> eddiemonge: all the tags that are replaced are called "replace" I can send different css to the printer via print element. The question is what do i change replace to on the replacement css?
[18:40:32] <mordof> dman777: yes, easily
[18:40:47] <bambams> eddiemonge: Agreed, but more complicated than ugly shared state, arbitrary counters, or recursive timers? I don't know.
[18:40:55] <eddiemonge> dman777: front end vs back end. jQuery happens on the front end. Perl/Python/PHP/Ruby happen on the backend
[18:41:26] <eddiemonge> bambams: its hard to help you without examples
[18:41:32] <Eruadan> hehe, not what this guy thinks http://www.byrichardpowell.co.uk/ he uses jquery for ui/ux quite a lot
[18:43:20] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: im not quite sure you are understanding what UI/UX is
[18:43:30] <Eruadan> no?
[18:43:44] <coldhead> i've never really understood either
[18:44:13] <cerberos> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Maintaining_Chainability has $this = $(this); when further up the page it says 'there's no need to do $(this) because "this" is already a jquery object'. What's the story?
[18:44:19] <eddiemonge> User Interface/User Experience. Its the design and layout of sites and the interaction of the user with it...as in button placement, text size/placement, that sort of thing
[18:44:31] <Gonad> hi
[18:44:35] <Gonad> is anyone using History.js?
[18:44:40] <Eruadan> yes, yes!that's what i like!!!
[18:44:48] <mordof> cerberos: that's to help with context/scope further on
[18:44:49] <dman777> eddiemonge: http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Definitive-Guide-Eric-Meyer/dp/0596527330/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330567709&sr=1- would this be outdated since it is not css3? it looks like it was published 2006
[18:44:51] <Gonad> i haev it working more or less but it keeps removing the hash
[18:44:59] <eddiemonge> cerberos: depends on what this is. if its in a plugin, this is already a jqobject. if its in a callback, this is the dom element
[18:45:14] <Gonad> like i expect http://blah/#!/page but something keeps turning it to http://blah/!/page
[18:45:15] <mordof> ah, good point
[18:45:16] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: that is design work. photoshop, indesign. not development
[18:45:21] <Gonad> is it my .htaccess?
[18:45:30] <cerberos> mordof: can you elaborate
[18:45:38] <eddiemonge> dman777: its got the basics. you need to understand that. css3 is more of the same
[18:45:51] <Eruadan> but i'm sure that if you know javascript, and pull some tricks in the top won't hurt ;)
[18:46:01] <eddiemonge> Gonad: could be. or it could be the js
[18:46:15] <mordof> cerberos: well, the way i use it is i do $self=$(this); in scenarios where i'm going to be doing other callbacks within a certain context so i can reference $self to influence the main context that i'm in
[18:46:16] <Gonad> my htaccess is pretty simple
[18:46:17] <cerberos> eddiemonge: yes it is a plugin, I know this is already a jqobject, so I'm not sure why the tutorial has $this = $(this) when it explicitly says it's not necessary
[18:46:29] <Eruadan> eddiemonge, and yes, i'm already very good with those tools you mention
[18:46:42] <Eruadan> i mean it, 10 years of experience
[18:46:43] <Germanaz0> Gonad: could you copy/paste on pastie.org the .htaccess ?
[18:46:47] <mordof> cerberos: like eddiemonge pointed out - sometimes this is a jqob, sometimes it isn't
[18:46:50] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: again its design versus development. designers are the architects (sometimes) and developers are the builders
[18:46:58] <Gonad> http://pastebin.com/gVQRjsWv
[18:47:19] <Eruadan> i think it happens that i'm a bit of both
[18:47:23] <Gonad> and i call History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "/#!/"+currentPageName);
[18:47:53] <cerberos> mordof: in a plugin it always is a jqobject (according to the docs), which is the context I'm talking about
[18:48:03] <mordof> cerberos: ok
[18:48:29] <Gonad> apache and php
[18:48:32] <Gonad> anything with apache?
[18:48:50] <Eruadan> i will be reading all the documents to make my mind before i do anything anyway, cheers mate
[18:48:53] <Germanaz0> Gonad: the htaccess is not
[18:48:54] <cerberos> mordof, eddiemonge: see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Context
[18:48:57] <Germanaz0> it works correctly
[18:49:14] <Gonad> Germanaz0: so the htaccess is fine
[18:49:16] <Gonad> so what else sit?
[18:49:21] <Gonad> im using chrome (canary)
[18:49:21] <dman777> eddiemonge: thank you for all your help
[18:49:40] <eddiemonge> cerberos: not always. if you have event handlers in the plugin then that uses a different "this"
[18:49:50] <Germanaz0> Gonad: how do you handle
[18:49:55] <Germanaz0> the page forward ?
[18:49:58] <Germanaz0> the JS
[18:50:17] <eddiemonge> cerberos: exactly
[18:50:21] <eddiemonge> like i said
[18:50:33] <cerberos> eddiemonge: I think I see the difference
[18:50:35] <Gonad> hrm
[18:50:46] <Gonad> seems like IE9 leaves /#!/
[18:50:51] <Gonad> whereas chrome removes #
[18:50:58] <Gonad> i havent handled page loading
[18:51:05] <Germanaz0> ahh Gonad
[18:51:06] <Gonad> i only got as far as handling the pushing
[18:51:10] <Germanaz0> try refresh the cache
[18:51:12] <Germanaz0> for chrome
[18:51:12] <Gonad> when i noticed
[18:51:19] <Germanaz0> ctrl+shift+R
[18:51:32] <Gonad> firefos does the same
[18:51:33] <Gonad> removs #
[18:51:38] <Gonad> just started up ff
[18:51:40] <Gonad> i hardly use ff
[18:51:41] <Germanaz0> if you had something before
[18:51:52] <Germanaz0> chrome or FF cache the JS
[18:51:58] <Gonad> oh and I always use shfit+ctrl+r :D
[18:51:59] <Germanaz0> the cache is very persistent
[18:52:09] <Gonad> i havent loaded up ff in ages and just did it now to test
[18:52:12] <Gonad> it removes #
[18:52:35] <Germanaz0> hmmm
[18:52:41] <Germanaz0> what are you using on JS ?
[18:52:43] <eddiemonge> cerberos: http://jsfiddle.net/BYhWm/
[18:52:47] <Germanaz0> to detect the hash ?
[18:52:54] <Gonad> nothign yet
[18:53:05] <Gonad> ttat line i posted
[18:53:07] <Germanaz0> so, without JS it removes the hash  ?
[18:53:13] <Gonad> History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "/#!/"+currentPageName);
[18:53:18] <Gonad> thats pretty much i call right now on a div click
[18:53:25] <Gonad> oh i havent tried without history js
[18:53:26] <Gonad> sec
[18:53:57] <Gonad> ah ha
[18:54:05] <Gonad> without history.js the urls stay
[18:54:18] <Gonad> so it must be history.js doing something (or rather expecting me to do something with the new state)>
[18:54:20] <Gonad> ?
[18:54:21] <Gonad> hrm
[18:54:27] <cerberos> eddiemonge: thx, I realised I was being a div. In the example I gave the $this = $(this) was inside .each(), so this context it is the current element, much the same as your example
[18:54:53] <Germanaz0> which version of history.js do you have ?
[18:55:19] <Gonad> latest
[18:55:47] <Gonad> html4+html5\jquery.history.js
[18:55:49] <Germanaz0> lemme see a sec
[18:56:27] <Germanaz0> that plugin are you using Gonad  ?¿
[18:56:28] <Germanaz0> https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[18:57:54] <Gonad> yup
[18:59:33] <Germanaz0> Gonad:
[18:59:34] <Germanaz0> try this
[18:59:50] <Germanaz0> History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "/!/"+currentPageName);
[18:59:54] <Germanaz0> or a sec
[18:59:58] <Germanaz0> History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "!/"+currentPageName);
[19:00:28] <Gonad> that's worked fine
[19:00:34] <Gonad> im not sure whyits removing the hash
[19:01:21] <Germanaz0> bcs the library
[19:01:27] <Germanaz0> add you the hash
[19:01:32] <Gonad> return fullUrl.replace(/\#$/,'');
[19:01:33] <Germanaz0> look at the example
[19:01:35] <Gonad> i see that in teh code
[19:01:44] <Gonad> history.js
[19:01:54] <Germanaz0> with HTML5 the url looks like www.mysite.com/?state=1
[19:02:01] <Germanaz0> with HTML4 www.mysite.com/#?state=1&_suid=1
[19:02:20] <Germanaz0> if you make this History.pushState({state:1}, "State 1", "?state=1");
[19:02:22] <Gonad> so it must be an html5 thing
[19:02:25] <Germanaz0> so the hash # is not needed
[19:02:32] <Gonad> gotcha
[19:02:35] <Gonad> wicked
[19:02:36] <Germanaz0> while pushing
[19:02:45] <Gonad> also heres the funnt thing
[19:02:48] <Germanaz0> which worked ?
[19:02:57] <Germanaz0> History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "!/"+currentPageName); (Example 1)
[19:03:04] <Gonad> either
[19:03:06] <Germanaz0> History.pushState({state:currentPageName}, currentPageName, "/!/"+currentPageName); ( example 2 )
[19:03:15] <Gonad> either of these /#!/, /!, !/
[19:03:22] <Gonad> they all force it to /!/
[19:03:37] <Gonad> anywho so once i see /!/blah in my url
[19:03:39] <Gonad> if i hit reload then
[19:03:41] <Gonad> i get blank page
[19:03:47] <Gonad> even if the page source has all content
[19:03:48] <Germanaz0> ahh
[19:03:53] <Gonad> guess is hould be handling the load then
[19:03:59] <Germanaz0> and why you want to add the ! ?
[19:04:52] <Eruadan> the ! denies, like !== not equal to, at least in plain javascript
[19:05:14] <Eruadan> but , i'm a newbie,^^, so i might be wrong
[19:05:42] <Germanaz0> uh ?
[19:05:43] <Germanaz0> xD
[19:05:51] <Germanaz0> ~ this denies too xD
[19:07:01] <Germanaz0> Gonad: http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/85-best-practices-dynamic-content/ this could be interesting for you :D
[19:09:02] <Gonad> Germanaz0 thanks :)
[19:09:16] <Gonad> hah i remember chris coyier
[19:09:24] <Gonad> ive watched much of his stuff some time ago
[19:12:36] <Germanaz0> that site is incredible xD
[19:29:04] <deltree_> so I really don't know what I'm doing with jquery-ui, I mean seriously, it doesn't work for me at all http://jsfiddle.net/ae7Yc/
[19:30:02] <deltree_> I have no clue what I'm missing
[19:31:00] <tw2113> ?tweets > tw2113
[19:31:02] <bot-t> tw2113, Couldn't find "tweets > tw2113" in jQuery Docs.
[19:32:23] <tw2113> damn https://github.com/kerberoS/jQuery-Tweets/blob/master/js/jquery.tweets.0.1.js
[19:33:45] <deltree_> ?
[19:33:57] <tw2113> i was looking at the jsfiddle examples
[19:34:26] <ndss56> deltree_: what do you want it to do in http://jsfiddle.net/ae7Yc/
[19:34:56] <deltree_> ndss56: this http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#default
[19:36:07] <deltree_> the jsfiddle shows the code works the same if there were no javascript at all
[19:36:52] <ndss56> deltree_: what is showing is a standard HTML button
[19:37:10] <deltree_> right, but jquery-ui should make it a better button
[19:37:19] <deltree_> and jquery-ui is not working at all
[19:37:39] <deltree_> what am I missing?
[19:39:28] <ndss56> deltree_: not sure. trying to figure it out myself....
[19:40:34] <Eruadan> Germanaz0. like a lot that video
[19:40:42] <deltree_> at first I thought it was just me, so I put together the jsfiddle thinking I'd see it in action and figure out what I did wrong, only to see it doesn't work on jsfiddle either, so I figured I'd come ask the experts
[19:41:38] <ndss56> deltree_: http://jsfiddle.net/ae7Yc/2/
[19:41:54] <ndss56> deltree_: thats as far as i got. you need to click on jquery_ui on left panel
[19:42:03] <ndss56> deltree_: still doesn't work though
[19:42:48] <deltree_> you added jquery-ui twice and we're still looking at nothing :(
[19:43:30] <ndss56> deltree_: i think you need to add resources on the left panel as well for the jquery_ui .css file
[19:43:48] <spiffie> it's working, but there's no special css loaded by jsfiddle
[19:43:51] <deltree_> I think you're right, just saw that it's generating the proper html
[19:47:51] <deltree_> yup, so it was me after all
[19:48:14] <deltree_> <link rel="Stylesheet" href=""/> is not the same as <link rel="stylesheet" href=""/>
[19:48:21] <spiffie> you can add this as a resource to the fiddle, and it will provide styling: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/start/jquery-ui.css
[19:48:38] <spiffie> (or a better version, if you prefer)
[19:49:01] <deltree_> thanks for your help spiffie and ndss56
[19:54:40] <Eruadan> this book is good? jQuery: Novice to Ninja
[19:56:44] <tetradon> How do you event bind on newly created elements?
[19:56:54] <tetradon> I use to use .live but it's deprecated now
[19:57:01] <RandalSchwartz> use ".on"
[19:57:03] <abjorn> stupid osx and it's stupid bsd
[19:57:06] <abjorn> :c
[19:57:07] <RandalSchwartz> works for old and new events
[19:57:15] <tetradon> I tried .on but it's not working
[19:57:27] <RandalSchwartz> then you aren't specifying it properly. :)
[19:57:36] <tetradon> I'm event binding for a click event
[19:57:58] <RandalSchwartz> what's your jq expression?
[19:58:07] <RandalSchwartz> a few of them are problematic, I hear.
[19:58:17] <tetradon> alright so this is what I have: $('.delete').bind('click', function() { ... });
[19:58:19] <RandalSchwartz> $('what here').on('click' ... )
[19:58:27] <coldhead> that's a filthy lie, RandalSchwartz, they're all perfect
[19:58:28] <RandalSchwartz> wel - that's a bind
[19:58:39] <RandalSchwartz> did you try .on ?
[19:58:40] <tetradon> oops, I had .on there
[19:58:41] <tetradon> lol
[19:59:10] <tetradon> yeah it doesn't work
[19:59:32] <tetradon> I just do an $('.all-posts').prepend(newPost);
[20:00:20] <tetradon> And then my .on code
[20:00:59] <tetradon> Is it because the element is a child of a parent?
[20:01:18] <tetradon> I don't see why it doesn't work
[20:01:52] <Marston> hi guys, can I override browser's back/forward buttons with custom functions?
[20:01:59] <coldhead> can you create a live demo at jsfiddle, tetradon ?
[20:03:02] <tetradon> Yeah I think I can recreate this. I have another script being called using ajax but I can just skip that part
[20:04:23] <coldhead> tetradon: just set up the html as it will eventually be in the page, on() doesn't care
[20:05:26] <tetradon> well everything is setup right
[20:05:36] <tetradon> The html being prepended is fine
[20:05:59] <tetradon> It's the .click for the delete class doesn't work on newly created elements
[20:08:52] <coldhead> tetradon: that is exactly the problem on() is meant to solve
[20:09:26] <tetradon> It doesn't seem to work though
[20:09:42] <tetradon> I'm almost done writing up everything on jsfiddle. I'll send a link soon
[20:10:23] <RandalSchwartz> you keep saying "it doesn't work"
[20:10:25] <RandalSchwartz> how do you know?
[20:10:35] <RandalSchwartz> start with somethign simple like an alert()
[20:10:57] <tetradon> because it doesn't ask me a question
[20:11:05] <tetradon> I'm using a confirm();
[20:11:22] <RandalSchwartz> well - I'll be anxious to see this then
[20:11:31] <tetradon> Alright sir :)
[20:11:34] <tetradon> You shall lol
[20:12:06] <MeowthThatsRight> Hey guys I had a question about the draggable UI plugin. I'm trying to get it so each individual image is able to be drag between the two sides. http://emos.justdied.com/sb <-- you have to create a new deck though (sorry) and then from there when you try and move one image it moves ALL of them not just a single one.
[20:16:01] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: i haven't looked at the code, but it looks like your selector is placed on the images container
[20:17:02] <MeowthThatsRight> Hmm.. should it be on the li and not the id of the img?
[20:17:48] <mordof> the img's have no id
[20:17:58] <MeowthThatsRight> yes they do
[20:18:04] <MeowthThatsRight> they're just dynamic
[20:18:05] <MeowthThatsRight> lol
[20:18:13] <MeowthThatsRight> id="000000005" or whatever
[20:18:20] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: that's not the img
[20:18:23] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: that's the li
[20:18:53] <MeowthThatsRight> ahh
[20:18:54] <coldhead> ID's can't start with a digit
[20:19:19] <Voziv> Hello, anyone know why "<script>window.jQuery || alert("NO JQUERY");</script>" directly after including jquery at the bottom of my html works just fine, but including it in a file shows me the messagebox saying "NO JQUERY"?
[20:19:34] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: what file intiates the drag n drop?
[20:19:38] <mordof> initiates*
[20:19:48] <coldhead> got a demo of this Voziv ?
[20:20:34] <MeowthThatsRight> mordof come again? basically all I want to do is be able to drag the from one side to the other side. click "save order" and then either json or array or csv I don't care ajax send that to my php and store it :D
[20:20:57] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: where is the code that sets up the UI drag n drop?
[20:21:00] <mordof> what javascript file
[20:21:04] <MeowthThatsRight> ooooh lol
[20:21:12] <MeowthThatsRight> slide-funcs.js
[20:21:16] <mordof> i know what you're trying to do - i've done it many times
[20:21:24] <MeowthThatsRight> wicked.
[20:22:23] <tetradon> http://jsfiddle.net/YfaAd/13/
[20:22:28] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: all i see is '.thumbs-view' .sortable, which is wrong
[20:22:40] <MeowthThatsRight> mordof i'm kinda new to the sortable lol
[20:23:16] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[20:23:24] <Voziv> coldhead: Putting up a test on a live server, I'll just be a moment
[20:24:01] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: i don't know that what you're trying to do would work properly under one sortable statement
[20:24:25] <coldhead> thanks Vozy
[20:24:31] <RandalSchwartz> tetradon - your html doesn't scan
[20:24:36] <RandalSchwartz> <a href=#"
[20:24:38] <RandalSchwartz> that's broken
[20:24:44] <tetradon> oops
[20:24:48] <RandalSchwartz> fix it and try again
[20:25:07] <tetradon> http://jsfiddle.net/YfaAd/14/
[20:25:15] <tetradon> It isn't like that in my code
[20:25:21] <tetradon> I just screwed up while typing it
[20:25:49] <RandalSchwartz> tetradon - that works for me
[20:25:57] <RandalSchwartz> the confirm pops up
[20:26:04] <tw2113> it doesn't delete the newly created ones
[20:26:21] <RandalSchwartz> does for me
[20:26:36] <RandalSchwartz> so if you can post something that is broken, let us know
[20:26:37] <tw2113> you're able to click "add new post" and then delete it afterwards?
[20:26:54] <RandalSchwartz> your code to add a container is broken
[20:26:59] <RandalSchwartz> please fix that too
[20:27:12] <RandalSchwartz> href=#"
[20:27:19] <RandalSchwartz> perhaps also a problem in your source
[20:29:10] <Voziv> coldhead: http://www.oneleveldeeper.com/
[20:30:47] <MeowthThatsRight> I think my stuff is just broken lol
[20:31:18] <tetradon> http://jsfiddle.net/YfaAd/16/
[20:31:28] <mordof> MeowthThatsRight: the link i posted tells you how to set it up properly
[20:31:51] <MeowthThatsRight> mordof I did and it just broke it
[20:31:56] <tetradon> I don't have any of these markup mistakes in my source
[20:32:00] * mordof refreshes
[20:32:43] <digital-ghost> http://pastie.org/3493682 -- Anyone able to tell me what the result of this function would be?
[20:33:31] <coldhead> Voziv: that's just weird, man
[20:33:57] <coldhead> what happens if you wrap the alert() bit in a $(document).ready( ... ) ?
[20:34:05] <Voziv> coldhead: I know, I created a test script called test.html on voziv.com with just the items at the bottom, and it doesn't do that
[20:34:16] <Voziv> It complains that $ doesn't exist
[20:34:19] <coldhead> Voziv: do you need the offline fallback?
[20:34:25] <coldhead> from modernizr?
[20:34:31] <coldhead> i would remove that line
[20:34:37] <Voziv> I tried without the fallback, same thing
[20:34:51] <Voziv> I also tried with only the fallback
[20:35:04] <coldhead> if only paul_irish were here
[20:35:28] <coldhead> what about this line
[20:35:29] <coldhead> $(document).onready(function(){$('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown();});
[20:35:35] <coldhead> there's no onready()
[20:35:47] <Voziv> If you refresh, it should be fixed
[20:36:03] <RandalSchwartz> $(document).onready?
[20:36:04] <tetradon> For me neither the confirm message pop ups or the newly created element is deleted
[20:36:13] <RandalSchwartz> what century are you from? :)
[20:36:50] <coldhead> Voziv: if you watch the document load in your debugger, it seems that jQuery is loading slowest
[20:36:57] <coldhead> and the others are all done first
[20:37:36] <coldhead> so i'd really expect $(document).ready around the whole of script.js would fix it
[20:37:36] <tetradon> If I refresh the page with the newly created elements "attached" to the DOM they delete
[20:37:45] <coldhead> but it's literally my first day using jQuery
[20:37:51] <Voziv> ah
[20:37:52] <coldhead> so i can't be sure
[20:38:02] <tetradon> Apparently .on doesn't work in this situation
[20:38:09] <coldhead> it shouldn't be this difficult
[20:38:22] <coldhead> tetradon: you really must be using on() weirdly
[20:38:24] <RandalSchwartz> tetradon - seems like a bug
[20:38:25] <RandalSchwartz> file it
[20:38:26] <coldhead> it should Just Work
[20:38:44] <coldhead> good call Randal
[20:38:57] <RandalSchwartz> might be that the click for <a> is taking over and not letting the event ripple
[20:38:59] <coldhead> make a reduced test case tetradon and take it to #jQuery-dev
[20:39:10] <RandalSchwartz> to be caught - it has to end up rippling to body
[20:39:25] <RandalSchwartz> do you need to use <a>?
[20:39:34] <RandalSchwartz> try it without that
[20:40:16] <RandalSchwartz> for .on to work, it has to bind at <body>, and therefore it has to ripple there
[20:40:24] <RandalSchwartz> would still be a bug, but understandable
[20:41:19] <RandalSchwartz> I'm guessing browser is eating <a href='#'> ... </a> click
[20:41:26] <Voziv> coldhead: Apparently I'm getting a bit tired. script.js appears physically before and after jquery. It's a zend based project, and I apparently was echoing the scripts out twice >.>
[20:41:31] <tetradon> Well they are meant to be clickable elements so an <a> is best for this situation
[20:41:32] <RandalSchwartz> since it has a logical meaning
[20:41:38] <coldhead> oh dear, sorry i didn't spot that Voziv
[20:41:44] <coldhead> let's never speak of this again
[20:41:59] <RandalSchwartz> tetradon - yes, logical, but see my explanation
[20:42:11] <RandalSchwartz> try something else.  might work.  might be a workaround.
[20:42:30] <RandalSchwartz> <ul class="delete">try clicking me</ul>
[20:43:47] <tetradon> I don't see how this is a bug. They would have caught this surely. It's such a common situation where you would need to use .on
[20:44:08] <RandalSchwartz> ok - don't even try
[20:44:12] <RandalSchwartz> my theory is crap
[20:44:12] <tetradon> Alright I'll try that I guess
[20:44:16] <RandalSchwartz> don't ask for my help in the future then
[20:44:32] <tetradon> I'm just trying to figure this out is all
[20:44:33] <RandalSchwartz> but seriously... I'm giving you a theory
[20:44:38] <RandalSchwartz> and possibly a workaround
[20:44:42] <RandalSchwartz> what else do you want for free?
[20:44:55] <tetradon> lol, alright I'll try it
[20:45:02] <RandalSchwartz> and .on is quite new
[20:45:10] <RandalSchwartz> so very likely some bugs are still there
[20:45:16] <RandalSchwartz> and your investigation might help
[20:45:34] <RandalSchwartz> I'm actually wondering how they would possibly solve this
[20:45:50] <RandalSchwartz> if <a href='#'> already has an action on click, that'll never end up in <body>
[20:45:52] <tetradon> What does facebook use then? A plugin they wrote for jquery?
[20:46:14] <RandalSchwartz> thus, I'm curious
[20:46:35] <RandalSchwartz> facebook has links like this that they add dynamically?
[20:46:47] <tetradon> posts are added dynamically
[20:46:59] <tetradon> I'm just trying to mimic this
[20:47:01] <RandalSchwartz> sure - but there aren't a lot of <a> in their code
[20:47:05] <RandalSchwartz> it's pretty weird
[20:47:17] <tetradon> They have a delete button on their posts
[20:47:18] <RandalSchwartz> lots of hoverish links
[20:47:22] <RandalSchwartz> BUTTON
[20:47:25] <RandalSchwartz> please pay attention
[20:47:29] <RandalSchwartz> not <a>
[20:47:31] <tetradon> well now it's a drop down list
[20:47:35] <RandalSchwartz> <button> is not <a>
[20:47:39] <tetradon> lol
[20:47:42] <tetradon> Well alright
[20:47:44] <RandalSchwartz> <a href='#'> has a meaning on click
[20:47:46] <tetradon> I'm testing it
[20:47:57] <RandalSchwartz> <button> has NO INHERENT MEANING
[20:48:13] <abjorn> $("#coldhead").detach();
[20:48:32] <coldhead> i think the click event ripples all the way up to body before the default action (following the href) occurs
[20:48:40] <coldhead> so you can cancel it
[20:48:46] <RandalSchwartz> coldhead - really?
[20:48:51] <coldhead> i /think/ so
[20:48:57] <RandalSchwartz> I would expect the most narrow thing gets to decide first
[20:49:01] <abjorn> notice I didn't assign the value to a variable, so you just got garbage collected, coldhead
[20:49:09] <RandalSchwartz> and ripple happens only if narrow declines
[20:49:23] <RandalSchwartz> taht's my understanding of ripple
[20:49:28] <tetradon> button doesn't work
[20:49:33] <tetradon> I just tried it
[20:49:39] <RandalSchwartz> well - different theory then
[20:49:41] * RandalSchwartz grins
[20:49:44] <RandalSchwartz> new theory: bug :)
[20:50:50] <tetradon> new practice: screw .on, I'm going back to .live
[20:50:51] <tetradon> lol
[20:51:04] <tetradon> It works fine with .live
[20:51:13] <tetradon> I'll file a bug report
[20:51:18] <LukeNukem> Yo dawgs
[20:51:20] <LukeNukem> wassup
[20:51:46] <RandalSchwartz> I'm getting really annoyed by my relatively new beard.
[20:51:53] <RandalSchwartz> I'm debating shaving it all off tomorrow
[20:52:05] <tetradon> thanks for the help RandalSchwartz for the help
[20:52:05] <LukeNukem> shave all the bear \m/
[20:52:08] <LukeNukem> beard*
[20:52:13] <RandalSchwartz> shave the bear!
[20:52:15] <abjorn> >shave all the bear
[20:52:19] <tetradon> Depends...
[20:52:21] <aqeel> lol
[20:52:24] <abjorn> crack open a bear
[20:52:27] <RandalSchwartz> that's the name of my Dudley Doright coverband!
[20:52:29] <coldhead> RandalSchwartz, tetradon http://jsfiddle.net/EGLSb/
[20:52:38] <coldhead> that catches the event before it follows the link
[20:52:41] <coldhead> and cancels it
[20:52:45] <tetradon> I know quite a few women who love beards
[20:53:16] <tetradon> I love beards ;)
[20:53:38] <abjorn> $("#coldhead").addClass("jquery-noob");
[20:53:55] <coldhead> that class is permanant and read only, abjsy
[20:54:21] <RandalSchwartz> heh stonehenge.com/merlyn :)
[20:54:22] <abjorn> a read only class, what the fuck world are we living in
[20:54:23] <tetradon> coldhead: Alright! Cool! Thanks! :)
[20:54:40] <coldhead> i'm in IE, abjorn
[20:54:43] <abjorn> oh
[20:54:45] <coldhead> things you wouldn't believe
[20:54:46] <abjorn> that would explain it
[20:56:40] <MeowthThatsRight> I followed the tutorial from the jquery site and they still aren't drag able.. http://emos.justdied.com/sb (must create a deck first)
[21:08:03] <abjorn> coldhead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AOLLcQ28w4 I feel kind of like this today
[21:11:49] <StevenCodes22> you n me both
[21:11:52] <LukeNukem> How can i animate a div onto the screen? right now i do $("body").append("<div class='img_display_status'> </div>");
[21:12:11] <LukeNukem> is it better to hide img_display_status and then to show it with some animations on click?
[21:15:29] <redheadphones> how can i use .filter() in a loop to whittle down an array, as in applying .filter() on each resulting array from the previous .filter() call until some condition is set
[21:16:49] <StevenCodes22> How much would I charge for jquery plugin updates or shit
[21:16:55] <MeowthThatsRight> I'm having an issue with .sortable() basically I'm trying to connect the two list but it won't allow me to. I'm thinking it has to do with the overflow:auto on the CSS itself but i'm not sure how else to overflow and connect . Anyone able to help? LINK: http://emos.justdied.com/sb
[21:21:16] <bambams> RandalSchwartz: :|
[21:22:14] <Eruadan> nice for the newbies http://visualjquery.com/
[21:22:56] <bambams> s,:|,\o/,
[21:24:45] <bambams> O_O Interestingly, that doesn't work at all as expected. Not only the unescaped \, but especially the unescaped |.
[21:25:14] <Veetee> Hi
[21:27:16] <bronson> I have some divs that appear on hover...  I want to be able to move the mouse over them and have them disappear when the mouse leaves.
[21:27:47] <bronson> This is not so easy because it's an irregular area...  if the mouse leaves one div and enters another I want them to remain up.
[21:28:35] <bronson> If the mouse leaves a div and doesn't enter another one, I want them all to hide.
[21:28:45] <bronson> Does that make sense?
[21:29:09] <bronson> Hoping there's an elegant way of doing this...  I can brute-force it with setTimeout but that's not fun.
[21:29:10] <donCams> bronson: make some delay once the mouse leaves
[21:29:26] <donCams> setTimeOut or .delay()
[21:29:30] <bambams> Nevermind what I was thinking of saying. ^ That sounds good. ;D
[21:29:47] <bronson> donCams: yep, that's what I'm picturing.  someone HAS to have solved this before...?
[21:30:06] <donCams> bronson: yes. they're using the ones i've mentioned
[21:30:18] <bambams> Yet, somebody doesn't have to have encapsulated it before. D:
[21:30:25] <donCams> on hover out, initiate the timeout
[21:30:46] <bronson> donCams: and store state in a data element somewhere
[21:31:18] <bronson> ugh...  so be it.  brute force ftw.
[21:31:19] <donCams> you can also implement closing the overlay ones the user clicks outside the divs :3
[21:31:26] <donCams> *once
[21:31:55] <bronson> according to the client, gotta be hover.
[21:32:22] <donCams> look at superfish's code. when you hover out of the dropdown, it retracts
[21:32:24] <Anorov> hi, i'm loading some images dynamically, and i want to bind a .load() callback to each of them. i can't seem to get it to work though
[21:32:24] <bronson> what about putting up a transparent div behind these elements?  when the mouse enters the transparent div, I'm sure it left my shape, then I hide everything
[21:32:58] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. I am using jquery BBQ to handle redirects from qr codes and I'm running into a simple problem. I parse the hash value on page load and if it has #attorney=john in it, I need to open the mobile url for that attorney.
[21:33:24] <Anorov> is there a way to somehow register the image load handler permanently, so every new image uses it, or something?
[21:34:19] <donCams> $('#myDiv1, #myDiv2').hover(function(){}, function(){ $('#theDiv').hide(); });
[21:34:23] <bronson> donCams: yeah, superfish is basically the exact behavior I'm looking for.
[21:34:26] <donCams> i don't know :))
[21:34:36] <donCams> but jQuery has the .hover() function
[21:34:42] <Whirl3d> so I say: window.location.href="m.lawfirm.com/#john" and it gives me the page: www.lawfirm.com/m.lawfirm.com/#john   which is invalid
[21:34:47] <donCams> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[21:36:01] <bronson> Whirl3d: w.l.href="http://m.lawfirm.com" ?
[21:36:21] <bronson> gotta include the scheme if you include the hostname.
[21:38:33] <Whirl3d> bronson, thanks for the reply. I tried that and it didn't work. I think it's because the hashchange function is grabbbing the url from bbq
[21:41:28] <Whirl3d> yep. I had already made a global variable called "manualHash" to tell my hash parser not to re-parse the url and all I had to do was set it to true. Works now. Anybody got a good tut on detecting mobile devices for redirection to a mobile site?
[21:42:14] <Anorov> i'm trying to do something like this: <img onload="$(this).parent().fadeIn(300)">. i can't seem to get .load() to work in this way; is it good style to use the onload attribute in this way?
[21:42:47] <Whirl3d> Anorov, no it is not
[21:43:03] <Whirl3d> you would be best to have your img elements defined without src attributes.
[21:43:12] <Whirl3d> then define the load handler
[21:43:19] <Whirl3d> then apply the src attr
[21:43:39] <Anorov> whirl3d: could you describe how? that seems like it'd be more complex than my current solution
[21:44:08] <Anorov> whirl3d: i can tell onload is probably archaic but...what i'm doing atm is a for loop that generates divs and fills them with an image, and i want the div to fadein once the image loads
[21:44:26] <Whirl3d> then immediately check if the image is pre-loaded (because it will fail in IE if it is cached) by checking the elements native "complete" attribute and then manually calling the load handler if true
[21:44:40] <Anorov> whirl3d: with the images i'm using, they will never ever be cached. if that simplifies things.
[21:45:17] <Whirl3d> var img=$("<img>").appendTo($("#someImageHolder")).load(imageLoaderFunc).attr("src",imageurl);
[21:45:40] <Whirl3d> if (img[0].complete) {imageLoaderFunc());
[21:45:55] <Anorov> thanks, i'll try that
[21:51:12] <darrellf> okay I'm back and still having a problem with IE and Jquery if someone is available to help I would appreciate it
[21:52:34] <RandalSchwartz> IE is usually the problem :)
[21:53:28] <darrellf> I realize IE is the problem but there has to be a solution other than not using jquery
[21:53:39] <RandalSchwartz> yes, stop using IE :)
[21:53:42] <Eruadan> i decided to ignore ie in my next projects
[21:54:21] <darrellf> I can't control what the customers use and can't turn away payments because they use IE
[21:54:55] <Eruadan> if ie, show some big warning " we do not support bad browsers" lol
[21:55:06] <Whirl3d> There are so many conflicting stories on how to redirect mobile devices, can someone give me some direction?
[21:56:00] <darrellf> anyway it has to do with loading form inputs into the page... using jquery .load()
[21:56:55] <darrellf> IE alerts all the data as returned but only adds the last 2 inputs to the page
[21:58:50] <Eruadan> damn ie, i thought it would be troubles only with css, now i see it is a real shit ;/
[21:59:55] <Eruadan> <darrellf>,maybe a gist with the code?
[22:00:08] <Whirl3d> darrellf, if you can tell me how long a piece of string is, I can answer your question.
[22:00:37] <Whirl3d> you have to provide some code or it's just a random question with no way to answer it.
[22:01:38] <darrellf> if you select add new address here it wil alert you the code that it got back  and in IE only telephone and Email actually get added to the page https://secure.vortalgroup.com/police/auction5/testlayout.php
[22:03:37] <Whirl3d> don't see "add new addresses" on this page
[22:03:59] <Whirl3d> sry
[22:04:01] <Whirl3d> see it now
[22:04:04] <darrellf> in the dropdown
[22:05:32] <Whirl3d> I get the same in Chrome as I do in IE
[22:06:06] <Whirl3d> course I'm using IE9, do you mean IE6 or 7?
[22:06:32] <darrellf> atleast IE8 and IE6 it does not work
[22:06:38] <darrellf> did not try in 9
[22:06:55] <darrellf> so 9 t actually flies in the whole set of inputs?
[22:07:54] <Whirl3d> so, you have it alert the content and it shows everything, right?
[22:08:10] <Whirl3d> but then you append it to your page and most of it is missing
[22:08:23] <Eruadan> cmon, ie 6 :/
[22:09:24] <LukeNukem> Is it possible to send an ajax request to grab an image?
[22:09:46] <darrellf> well it is alerting what was returned on the complete event of .load()... so it should already have been trying to apend it... but yes
[22:09:48] <LukeNukem> Hi Whirl3d
[22:09:50] <Anorov> is there any way i can use .on() to replicate .live()'s functionality of adding the same binding to past and future elements?
[22:10:01] <Anorov> i know .live() is deprecated but i wasn't quite able to get .on() to work the way i wanted
[22:10:20] <donCams> Anorov: .on is working like that
[22:10:32] <donCams> at least i think so
[22:10:41] <Anorov> donCams: doesn't seem to
[22:10:43] <LukeNukem> Anorov, .on does not work the way i want it too either
[22:10:47] <Whirl3d> Anorov, do you have all of your images in a common container (that's preferably not the dom itself)
[22:10:53] <Cork> Anorov: $(document).on('event', 'selector') is the same as live
[22:10:54] <Anorov> whirl3d: yes, i do
[22:11:13] <Whirl3d> then are your images predefined with src attributes?
[22:11:27] <Whirl3d> or can you define them after they are added to the dom?
[22:11:41] <Anorov> whirl3d: they are defined after they added. in fact, that was what you just suggested i add, which i just did
[22:11:45] <Anorov> after they are added*
[22:12:04] <Whirl3d> Perfect. Then what is the problem? What failed?
[22:12:44] <Anorov> well, in this case i have <input>s loaded below each image. i was trying to add a handler for the inputs, which all belong to one class
[22:12:44] <optraz> http://jsfiddle.net/jmarikle/FeKqp/2/  <== can anyone explain where is this.selectedIndex originate from  in the javascript window?
[22:13:27] <Anorov> for example $(".inputclass").on("keypress", handler). which is the syntax i used to use for .live()
[22:13:58] <Cork> optraz: what do you mean?
[22:14:11] <Cork> its the selected option in the select element
[22:14:59] <optraz> Cork: if i code, how do i know which word to use? is the selectedIndex is predefined?
[22:15:21] <Cork> optraz: its an element property yes
[22:15:48] <optraz> element property, do you mean i cna find selectedIndex in html documentation?
[22:16:13] <Cork> cna find?
[22:16:18] <Cork> can find?
[22:16:27] <Cork> ah
[22:16:28] <BadQuanta> Yo.  If I want to select all children who's class is .view, but not their subsequent children who are also .view.  Would this be the right selector: ".view:not(.view .view)"?
[22:16:29] <optraz> cant locate it.. http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
[22:16:33] <optraz> Cork: ^^
[22:16:34] <Cork> ..
[22:16:49] <Cork> optraz: don't use w3schools
[22:16:50] <Cork> it sucks
[22:16:58] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[22:16:59] <bot-t> Cork, W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention - http://w3fools.com/
[22:17:31] <Cork> optraz: dom elements of different type has properties
[22:17:44] <Cork> select has among other selectIndex
[22:17:51] <Cork> *selectedIndex
[22:18:01] <optraz> hmm..where can i find more information about selectedIndex please?
[22:18:17] <BadQuanta> Well.. I don't know why I asked.
[22:18:20] <BadQuanta> I just tried it.
[22:18:20] <Cork> ?mdc selectedindex

[22:18:25] <BadQuanta> excuse my stupidity. Please.
[22:18:35] <donCams> Anorov: http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:18:42] <Cork> xul... not exactly what i was looking for
[22:19:16] <Cork> optraz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/select
[22:19:22] <donCams> sorry. forgot to save the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/TrY5S/
[22:20:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/LFv9q/2/
[22:20:29] <Whirl3d> Anorov, here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/LFv9q/2/
[22:21:27] <optraz> Cork: thank you. looks like we can access the selected index using dom this.selectedIndex
[22:21:32] <optraz> thank you. now it is clear
[22:21:38] <Whirl3d> Cork! my hero! How do you redirect mobile traffic to a mobile site?
[22:21:47] <Anorov> whirl3d: i'm trying to add a handler for "keypress" on the input. but i see the syntax now
[22:22:24] <Cork> Whirl3d: if you really want to redirect them, you need ua sniffing
[22:22:38] <Cork> Whirl3d: a modern way is to do it through css, and only have one site
[22:22:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I'm working on that
[22:23:01] <Whirl3d> But until I get it all worked out, I have a jquery mobile site setup for them
[22:23:02] <Cork> ?g detect mobile browsers @ Whirl3d
[22:23:03] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Detect Mobile Browsers - Open source mobile phone detection - http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[22:23:39] <Whirl3d> you rock. Thanks. I have found a million different ways, but wasn't sure which to use. This is perfect.
[22:23:41] <Cork> hmm
[22:23:41] <Cork> no
[22:23:48] <Cork> ?g detectmobilebrowsers.mobi @ Whirl3d
[22:23:49] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Detect Mobile Browsers - Mobile User Agent Detection - http://detectmobilebrowsers.mobi/
[22:23:55] <Cork> there we go
[22:24:19] <Cork> Whirl3d: thats the one i use
[22:25:16] <theBrettman> why can't I use event.pageX and event.pageY for my: and at: on ui-position?
[22:25:30] <Cork> Whirl3d: all you really need is a list of ua's the coding is simple
[22:26:15] <Whirl3d> I tried that using a regex to match against all re-directable user agents and it failed.
[22:26:39] <Cork> well you can't do it with one regex :)
[22:26:54] <Cork> it takes about 3-4
[22:27:16] <Whirl3d> var isMobile = navigator.userAgent.match(/(iPhone|iPod|iPad|Android|BlackBerry)/i);
[22:27:30] <Cork> that won't catch even half :)
[22:27:45] <Whirl3d> See, I am so glad you are here!
[22:28:04] <LukeNukem> how can i fetch an image using ajax?
[22:28:23] <Cork> LukeNukem: you can't
[22:28:37] <Cork> you can only add element that fetches the image
[22:28:54] <LukeNukem> ok
[22:29:06] <LukeNukem> so i want to add a loading bar before the image is shown
[22:29:08] <Cork> img, canvas, object, css background-image and so forth
[22:29:11] <LukeNukem> like in lightbox plugins
[22:29:18] <LukeNukem> how can i do that
[22:29:39] <Cork> would prob add a loading indicator inline
[22:29:54] <Cork> and show it through js before the lightbox open
[22:30:40] <Cork> or you can have lightbox open the throbber
[22:30:47] <Cork> load the image in the background
[22:30:59] <Cork> and when its load event triggers replace your placeholder
[22:31:07] <Cork> theres many ways
[22:34:03] <Whirl3d> Cork, but here is the real issue. If someone wants to go to a specific attorney's page, I have BBQ read the hash and redirect accordingly.   lawfirm.com#john   would go to the appropriate page. So I want this to be true for mobile browsers, but their url needs to be m.lawfirm.com#john   any suggestions?
[22:34:08] <LeoJweda> hi, my jquery slider slider isn't rendering properly
[22:34:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: # is never submitted to the server
[22:34:55] <Cork> Whirl3d: so you would have to do that in js
[22:34:58] <LeoJweda> the "highlighted" part is like twice the height of the slider, any ideas?
[22:35:54] <Cork> LeoJweda: "somethings" wrong with your css
[22:36:04] <Cork> though what isn't something one can guess
[22:36:18] * LeoJweda examines his CSS
[22:36:35] <Cork> inspect the rendering in your browser instead
[22:36:44] <Cork> it'll tell you more
[22:37:52] <LeoJweda> Cork: i removed all CSS and it worked, now i gotta guess what was causing the problem.
[22:38:12] <Cork> as i said, inspect the element in the browser
[22:38:19] <Cork> and you'll be able to toggle the css
[22:38:27] <Cork> it should be simple to find it
[22:38:28] <LeoJweda> will do that now
[22:43:50] <mindis|wurk> argh. date comparisons are atrocious in javascript. doesn't help that parseInt can't even convert numbers with leading zeros properly
[22:44:10] <DreamStiffler> !seen cork
[22:44:34] <Cork> <_<
[22:44:35] <donCams> Cork: ping!
[22:44:43] <donCams> lmao... you're quite famous here Cork
[22:44:47] <DreamStiffler> Cork:hi guess what i figured our causing problem to my code
[22:45:11] <donCams> your irc client sounds enabled? eh Cork?
[22:45:13] <Cork> ok?
[22:45:19] <Cork> nope
[22:45:38] <Cork> but i have a summary window that shows a bright red line when someone highlight me
[22:45:54] <donCams> that drives me crazy
[22:46:00] <DreamStiffler> can anyone tell me why .innerText or .textContent use by the next node  cannot be read when the html row isnt coded in line?
[22:46:25] <Cork> donCams: its a summary window, and its only the text color
[22:46:33] <DreamStiffler> brb ..toilet
[22:46:44] <Anorov> doncams and whirl3d: here's an example that does what i want http://jsfiddle.net/vnuzu/ and here is what i'm using which does not work, i suppose due to things being loaded dynamically in a callback: http://jsfiddle.net/hL2nr/
[22:46:47] <donCams> still, it drives me mad
[22:46:54] <Cork> DreamStiffler: coded inline?
[22:46:58] <theBrettman> in case anyone wants to know, to use event.pageX and event.pageY for ui-position's at: and my: , you just set of: event
[22:48:25] <LeoJweda> Cork: Got it! There was padding on .ui-widget-header and .ui-widget-content by the other developer.
[22:48:36] <Cork> :)
[22:49:06] <Anorov> and switching .on() to .live() fixes it, in the second example
[22:49:33] <Cork> Anorov: did you miss my response on how you express live with on?
[22:49:48] <Anorov> cork: sorry, i may've
[22:49:54] <donCams> Anorov: i also provided an example
[22:50:01] <Cork> Anorov: $(document).on('event', 'selector', function) is the same as live
[22:50:11] <donCams> Whirl3d: also provided an example
[22:50:16] <Cork> Anorov: selector is what you put in $() in live
[22:50:33] <donCams> Anorov: http://jsfiddle.net/TrY5S/ here's my example
[22:50:55] <Cork> Anorov: on doesn't have a live syntax, but it has delegate, and it can express live's syntax just fine
[22:51:12] <Cork> (better actaully)
[22:51:33] <Whirl3d> Anorov, use one "on" statementon the "#content" element
[22:51:36] <Anorov> ahhh thank you doncams
[22:51:39] <Whirl3d> then add as many as you want
[22:51:53] <Anorov> i see how it works now. you have to add that extra argument
[22:52:14] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/hL2nr/1/
[22:52:21] <LeoJweda> gotta go now, thanks again Cork
[22:52:23] <LeoJweda> 'night *
[22:52:29] <Whirl3d> changed one line.
[22:54:19] <theBrettman> I <3 postion()
[22:54:25] <theBrettman> *position
[22:54:34] <coldhead> that's what she said
[22:54:37] <coldhead> probably
[22:54:47] <theBrettman> I always typo on that word. that and hello world
[22:55:18] <theBrettman> can't spell hello world without hellow, lol
[22:55:28] <theBrettman> always have to use backspace
[22:55:34] <Whirl3d> so if I create a php function that checks user agents, how do I get javascript to access it?
[22:55:40] <Whirl3d> through ajax or something?
[22:56:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: best is prob to do the same in js
[22:56:39] <Cork> Whirl3d: but php could set a value in the page like mobile = true
[22:56:44] <Cork> if thats all you need
[22:56:48] <Cork> (in js)
[23:01:30] <DreamStiffler> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vHZdF/17/ differ the two rows...second row wouldnt return result in webkit browsers
[23:01:40] <DreamStiffler> i had to hold my shat for this
[23:01:57] <Cork> Whirl3d: just checked up on one thing
[23:02:02] <donCams> !seen tw2113
[23:02:09] <DreamStiffler> cork:any documentation  on this? why wouldnt it work?
[23:02:15] <Cork> Whirl3d: what type of redirect are you using?
[23:02:27] <tw2113> what about me
[23:02:31] <DreamStiffler> cork: what should i search google for
[23:02:45] <Whirl3d> window.location.href='m.lawfirm.com'+hash
[23:02:49] <donCams> hey look, anon function in php http://codepad.viper-7.com/dzLb7v
[23:03:09] <Whirl3d> or rather window.location.href="http://m.lawfirmcom"+hash
[23:03:11] <donCams> i should post my worthless functions in github
[23:03:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: http redirect 303 or 302 should give you the effect your after
[23:03:57] <Cork> the browser should keep the original fragment
[23:04:54] <Cork> DreamStiffler: what isn't working?
[23:05:29] <DreamStiffler> cork:see in console log. do not modify the html. click both check boxes.
[23:05:32] <Cork> DreamStiffler: it works just fine here
[23:05:44] <DreamStiffler> cork: the bottom one wouldnt log in console...itll return empty
[23:06:06] <DreamStiffler> cork: i found out the cause is because the html <td
[23:06:12] <Cork> DreamStiffler: do you remember the "check for body" i mentioned?
[23:06:15] <DreamStiffler> cork: <td> layout
[23:06:18] <Cork> you haven't done that :)
[23:06:20] <DreamStiffler> nope
[23:06:25] <DreamStiffler> what check for body?
[23:06:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vHZdF/18/
[23:07:35] <Cork> oh sorry thats not it
[23:07:57] <Cork> hmm wonder what nextSibling returns when there isn't any siblings...
[23:08:38] <Cork> lol...
[23:08:41] <Cork> textnode...
[23:08:56] <Cork> ok... that... fails
[23:09:06] <tw2113> less fail Cork
[23:09:43] <DreamStiffler> what body cork? i mustve missed what you said
[23:09:44] <StevenHammons22> wish i could find one non-yankee that knows what i know
[23:09:44] <StevenHammons22> lol
[23:11:21] <Cork> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/vHZdF/19/
[23:12:26] <Blue-Dragon> is there a way to animate an element and let it fade out while animating? I tried a simple $(this).animate(pos).fadeOut(); but the fade only starts as soon as the animate has finished.
[23:12:46] <Anorov> final question: if i have something like <div class="x"><span class="y">1</span></div><div class="x"><span class="y"></span></div>, and i currently have the first span ".y" selected, what's the cleanest way to get to the next ".y"? $(this).parent().next().children(".y") seems a bit gross
[23:12:48] <Cork> Blue-Dragon: opacity:0 ?
[23:13:02] <DreamStiffler> Cork: can explain if(parent.nodeName === 'BODY') { return; }?
[23:13:17] <darrellf> hmmm https://secure.vortalgroup.com/police/auction5/index.php can anyone tell my why in IE8 and IE6 when you select add new address it only flies in part of the returned data
[23:13:18] <Anorov> cleanest and fastest too, i suppose
[23:13:21] <Cork> DreamStiffler: its a saify check
[23:13:27] <Blue-Dragon> oh gosh, didn't think about that. Thank you Cork, works fine.
[23:13:41] <Cork> DreamStiffler: if your current element doesn't have a td parent
[23:13:54] <Cork> it could go up until it hits html
[23:14:06] <Cork> DreamStiffler: the code checks for body to prevent that
[23:14:13] <b0ggs> I've got a weird issue where I'm checking a parameter to see if its true, but even if I declare it true directly before it wont pass. However if I alert just before the check it will  'update' the parameter and check it correctly.
[23:14:17] <Cork> but that means parent could be body if no target was found
[23:15:11] <b0ggs> Here is the relevant code, sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/ExVJ2/
[23:15:41] <DreamStiffler> cork saify?
[23:16:36] <Cork> DreamStiffler: sorry *safety
[23:17:59] <Cork> b0ggs: and what code isn't working?
[23:18:20] <b0ggs> the section that starts with: if(options.submitOnReturn == true)
[23:18:26] <Veetee> hi
[23:18:39] <b0ggs> cork: the section submits if and only if an alert is directly before it
[23:18:50] <Cork> b0ggs: is options even an object?
[23:19:18] <DreamStiffler> Cork: thanks
[23:19:34] <Cork> b0ggs: it would help if you actaully constructed the pb so it actaully works
[23:19:44] <Cork> this is just static dead code
[23:20:07] <Cork> DreamStiffler: np
[23:21:37] <veetee1> can anyone tell me why my slider for spToggleIcon isnt working? http://forum.prehospitalmedicine.ca/
[23:21:53] <veetee1> the script is in
[23:22:29] <Cork> veemon: "$ is not a function"
[23:22:34] <veetee1> http://forum.prehospitalmedicine.ca/wp-content/plugins/simple-press/forum/resources/jscript/spToggleSubView.js?ver=3.3.1
[23:22:48] <darrellf> Cork can you take a look at mine when you get a chance and tell me why add new address is not working properly in IE6, IE7 and IE8? https://secure.vortalgroup.com/police/auction5/index.php
[23:22:52] <Cork> you either missing jquery or jquery haven't loaded yet or you've overwritten it
[23:23:27] <Cork> darrellf: ??
[23:23:36] <Cork> your sure thats the correct url?
[23:23:51] <b0ggs> cork: I'll link the full thing for you sorry, one second: http://jsfiddle.net/ExVJ2/1/
[23:24:21] <veetee1> hmm thats odd, isnt it loading before the script?
[23:24:31] <darrellf> opps https://secure.vortalgroup.com/police/auction5/testlayout.php
[23:24:44] <veetee1> i have called the effects-core and effects-slide js files
[23:26:19] <darrellf> I'm using .load() and as you can see from the .load callback alert it seems to be getting all the data back but only loading the last 2 fields into the page
[23:27:10] <StevenHammons22> What is a kewl jquery app i could build hmmmmm
[23:27:43] <darrellf> one that makes IE behave like a normal browser
[23:28:09] <Cork> veetee1: $ is (function JSTH_$(aId) {try {return aJSTerm._window.document.getElementById(aId);} catch (ex) {aJSTerm.console.error(ex.message);}})
[23:28:17] <Cork> thats not jquery
[23:29:02] <Cork> veetee1: sorry scratch that
[23:29:10] <Cork> its my debug tool messing with me
[23:30:33] <veetee1> its okay, should i change the script?
[23:34:19] <b0ggs> cork: got it figured out, just needed to throw $this.options.submitOnReturn
[23:34:22] <Cork> darrellf: old rant; your serving html, so don't use xhtml doctype
[23:36:49] <DreamStiffler> how do i post | (pipeline) via IE
[23:37:01] <DreamStiffler> webkit dont seem to have any trouble posting it
[23:37:05] <DreamStiffler> IE returns empty
[23:38:58] <darrellf> Cork okay thought everything was just xhtml these days. But I'm guessing that is not the IE problem?
[23:39:35] <Cork> darrellf: no nothing has more or less ever been xhtml
[23:39:59] <Cork> darrellf: to serv xhtml the mimetype of your page has to be application/xhtml+xml
[23:40:06] <Cork> else its just broken html
[23:40:16] <Cork> darrellf: just use the simple html doctype
[23:40:19] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[23:40:30] <darrellf> so i should be using html4 doc type then
[23:40:36] <Cork> no
[23:40:42] <Cork> just "<!doctype html>"
[23:40:42] <darrellf> html okay
[23:40:57] <Cork> html is version less now days
[23:41:48] <darrellf> as you can probably tell been a while since i did front end stuff lol
[23:42:00] <Cork> darrellf: yup :)
[23:42:13] <JonnyCash> what tools do you guys use to optimize + check cross browser compat?
[23:44:05] <Cork> darrellf: though not sure why it fails with your html fragemnt
[23:44:21] <Cork> only thing i can think of is parsing error
[23:45:07] <Cork> JonnyCash: kvm instances
[23:45:13] <JonnyCash> really eh..
[23:45:18] <JonnyCash> everyone seems to be doing it this way
[23:45:32] <Cork> only way to make sure you see the correct rendering
[23:45:43] <JonnyCash> can you do mobile that way too?
[23:45:57] <Cork> ios is imposible as far as i know
[23:46:05] <Cork> but android has a vm too
[23:46:29] <Cork> ios i'll just have to take as a "before release test"
[23:46:39] <Whirl3d> anybody know off-hand how to set the default state of a collapsible element in jquery mobile to collapsed?
[23:46:41] <Xlator> Having some trouble with deferreds. Full story @ https://gist.github.com/1947303 . Have searched all over the place and found lots of similar code that works, can't wrap my head around what's wrong. Basically, the deferred object never resolves.
[23:47:19] <darrellf> yeah it is weird that is alerting what it got back but only adding the last part
[23:48:05] <Whirl3d> darrellf, I thinks it's going to be a css issue. If you look at the source, it's all there.. Just some of it is not showing
[23:48:14] <Anorov> final question: if i have something like <div class="x"><span class="y">1</span></div><div class="x"><span class="y"></span></div>, and i currently have the first span ".y" selected, what's the cleanest way to get to the next ".y"? $(this).parent().next().children(".y") seems a bit gross
[23:48:51] <Whirl3d> $(this).next(); ?
[23:49:10] <Cork> Xlator: why arn't you just using the build in deffer from ajax?
[23:49:29] <Cork> .error .success .completed
[23:49:39] <jrockjiggz> $(.y).eq(1)
[23:49:59] <Xlator> Cork: As in return $.ajax().promise() ? Tried that. Never resolves.
[23:50:09] <Anorov> whirl3d: sorry, that's a bad example. there are more things nested inside each div, so next just returns a sibling
[23:50:19] <Cork> Xlator: no just do return $.ajax()
[23:50:25] <jrockjiggz> or.. $('.y:eq(1)')
[23:50:30] <Anorov> jrock: anyway to do something like $(".y").eq(current+1)?
[23:50:31] <Xlator> error success and completed just point to done, fail and always according to nettuts.
[23:50:54] <Xlator> Cork: I'll try that.
[23:50:55] <Cork> Xlator:  function a() { return $.ajax(...); });  a().error().success()
[23:51:27] <jrockjiggz> Anorov: sure
[23:51:54] <Anorov> jrockjiggz: well, i guess increment a variable each time i need to?
[23:52:26] <jrockjiggz> Anorov: i don't know what you are trying todo
[23:52:31] <darrellf> Whirl3d actually that might get closer to the problem... because looking at the source it appears to be all there except the first field is still missing
[23:52:47] <Xlator> Cork: Doesn't work either.
[23:52:56] <Anorov> jrockjiggz: i have a series of elements, and when "enter" is pressed, i just want to go to the next element of that class, over and over. the element is nested in a separate div though.
[23:53:34] <Cork> Anorov: dosen't get better then $(this).closest('.x').next().find('.x')
[23:53:47] <Cork> Anorov: its just how dom works
[23:54:23] <Anorov> cork: would that be slow, at all? having to traverse the dom over and over, if i run this hundreds of times?
[23:54:49] <Cork> Anorov: parent() and next() is about as fast as anything can be
[23:54:56] <Cork> its just pointers
[23:55:06] <Cork> this.parent.nextElementSibling
[23:55:21] <Cork> closest is a LITTLE slower, but safer
[23:55:31] <Anorov> how about .find()?
[23:55:32] <Cork> same with nextAll
[23:55:34] <jrockjiggz> Anorov: eq works good, you might want to traverse so your not querying your dom every time
[23:55:46] <Cork> it only looks in that dom elements childern
[23:55:56] <Cork> so unless it has a HUG amount of elements in it
[23:55:59] <Cork> it shouldn't matter
[23:56:16] <jrockjiggz> $(this).parent().next().find('.y')   it's a bit ugly
[23:57:12] <Cork> ya this is prob the safest you can ever be $(this).closest('.x').nextAll('.x').eq(0).find('.x')
[23:57:15] <jrockjiggz> Anorov: theres also $('.y')[1]
[23:57:25] <Xlator> Cork: Is there any way of checking the state without using an explicit promise(), so I can check if it is pending/successful/failed?
[23:57:34] <Cork> jrockjiggz: thats slower and riskier
[23:57:59] <Anorov> jrock: i just realized elements are also going to be removed from the dom, depending on what a user's doing, so it may not always work the way i want. i suppose i'll stick with the parent() thing
[23:58:02] <Xlator> 'cos when I was using $.Deferred, state() said "pending" forever".
[23:58:04] <jrockjiggz> i wonder if you can use closest in a forward motion
[23:58:28] <Anorov> yeah, that would be nice. i wish i could use closest without it selecting itself
[23:58:37] <Anorov> like a .nextClosest() or something
[23:59:00] <Cork> Xlator: the the readyState and status should so that
[23:59:13] <Xlator> Anorov: Can't you just use a better/more unique idetifier, like add a data field and use .y[data-something=z] as your selector?
[23:59:29] <Xlator> Or cache the location in a variable?
[23:59:49] <Anorov> xlator: i'm not sure. in this case, i literally want the next closest, whether above or below the current element
