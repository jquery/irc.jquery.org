[00:00:29] <Braden`> Anyone?
[00:02:04] <Braden`> request.done(function (response, textStatus, jqXHR){  <--- How do I break response down into variables?
[00:02:28] <Braden`> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ <-- Doesn't have any of the parms
[00:05:12] <Braden`> Anyone?
[00:05:23] <Braden`> 776 people, 1 awake
[00:05:40] <Braden`> Thats what I get for being non-US/Europe timezone :(
[00:27:20] <xdjuj_> Braden` can't you use list() ?
[00:33:27] <Nebros> is there an easy way to open a link of my page in mid, with this effect "background darken"?
[00:34:06] <Braden`> list()?  Let me look up the docs
[00:34:17] <JesperA> ?list
[00:34:26] <bot-t> JesperA, .last() | jQuery API Documentation - Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[00:35:53] <Braden`> That doesn't sound right...
[00:36:20] <Braden`> I am assuming the response is sent in the form of serialized data or just standard html output?
[00:36:24] <Cork> Braden`: are you returning json?
[00:36:53] <Braden`> No, I don't think so
[00:36:55] <Cork> Braden`: the data is sent in the form your server tells the client it is
[00:37:07] <Cork> text, html, xml, json ...
[00:37:11] <Braden`> I have php handling the response, but I am not doing anything special to encapsulate it
[00:37:16] <Braden`> Its being sent back in the form of html
[00:37:40] <Cork> and you want it parsed to dom elements or what?
[00:38:24] <Braden`> I would like it returned in the form of variables that I could then parse client side
[00:46:16] <tay1> does anyone have experience with tokenInput?
[00:47:09] <aquatix> Braden`: I would go with json
[00:47:22] <aquatix> That's easy parsing in JavaScript
[00:53:08] <tay1> anyone?
[01:01:25] <topriddy> wanted  to confirm stuff, if i have a form with multiple submit buttons, javascript is the way to go right? sample code link please?
[01:01:51] <Cork> "to go right"?
[01:03:00] <JesperA> every server side language can handle multiple submit buttons, no need for javascript for that
[01:03:38] <Cork> unless you use ajax, then you can't handle it natively
[01:03:45] <topriddy> JesperA: in a single form? how do you specify what action url to go too?
[01:03:54] <topriddy> :/
[01:04:16] <JesperA> why do you need different actio urls?
[01:04:34] <Cork> topology: without javascript you go to the same url, and what button you clicked tells what to do
[01:04:46] <Cork> with javascript you modify the action url, or set a hidden value
[01:05:03] <AdamPDotty> <input type="submit" name="action" value="MAction">
[01:05:07] <Cork> as the submit event doesn't exposed what button was clicked
[01:05:19] <AdamPDotty> doesnt?
[01:05:29] <Cork> no
[01:05:33] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[01:05:44] <AdamPDotty> submit is an input like any other
[01:05:49] <Cork> well it does in some browsers, but not all
[01:05:59] <Cork> AdamPDotty: submit EVENT
[01:06:04] <Cork> not submit input type
[01:09:27] <topriddy> AdamPDotty: so the clicked button has a value? that way i can know?
[01:09:55] <JesperA> no, name
[01:10:49] <topriddy> AdamPDotty: can i have multiple input submit buttons in a form with same name, but different values, on click, i know by checking the value? is that t???
[01:11:05] <Cork> topology: if your doing a basic html form, the button pushed to submit the form will be included in the params sent to the server
[01:11:07] <topriddy> JesperA: sorry for disturbing on such a simple concept.
[01:11:21] <Olambataar> Can't seem to attach events to dynamically created controls using '.on()'. Check it out http://jsfiddle.net/N6G45/2/ (see the 2 events which are commented "DO NOT WORK") Compare that to this working example, where the only difference is that I've added onclick and onchange in the markup http://jsfiddle.net/N6G45/1/
[01:11:23] <Cork> topology: the value is what is visible on the button
[01:11:42] <topriddy> Cork: then what do i look for then? ie check?
[01:11:52] <Cork> topology: isset?
[01:12:27] <topriddy> Cork: doing java/jsp. if i know the "value" to look for i can translate
[01:12:47] <AdamPDotty> topriddy yes
[01:13:29] <AdamPDotty> like http://mattzug.de/bmm/skript
[01:13:37] <AdamPDotty> simple design, lots of submit buttons
[01:17:08] <topriddy> AdamPDotty: yeah, but you still havent explained what value to look for in the name of the button
[01:17:25] <topriddy> if the button is the one clicked, what value is it going to be set too?
[01:17:45] <JesperA> the name
[01:17:55] <AdamPDotty> the shown value as mentioned by Cork
[01:18:09] <AdamPDotty> the name is used as key
[01:18:20] <sacho_> Olambataar, I don't see an element with the xyz_onSelect class, and I don't see your button being added either
[01:19:24] <topriddy> java: request.getParameter("name1")...i dont know what to test what this is going to be equal too.
[01:20:00] <AdamPDotty> whatever you set the input value to
[01:20:39] <Olambataar> sacho: the button in question is defined as 'var btnRemove = $('<button class="btnRemoveDropdown" >remove</button>');' and the select element that is supposed to have the onSelect event attached is is defined as 'var ddl = $('<select class="addableDropdown" />');  '
[01:20:46] <topriddy> AdamPDotty: ie the displayed value. thanks :)
[01:21:03] <sacho> Olambataar, I'm talking specifically about:
[01:21:28] <sacho> $('.addableDropdown_onSelect') <-- there is no element with such a class
[01:21:39] <topriddy> AdamPDotty: if thhis works, it'll mean our old implementations were unneccessary complex> ***covers face***
[01:22:00] <Olambataar> I'm trying to attach an event for the button like this : $('.btnRemoveDropdown').on('click', function () { removeParent($(this));});
[01:22:04] <sacho> also, you create the container, but then you try to use it(getDropdownCount) before its been added to the DOM - so your count function fails, and you never add the button
[01:22:28] <topriddy> what would have been close to perfect though is multiple buttons with same name, but different values. so i can just look up one parameter name in server back end...but then this is fine too
[01:22:32] <Olambataar> and trying to attach an onchange event to the dropdown like this: $('.addableDropdown_onSelect').on('change', function() { addableDropdown_onSelect(); });
[01:22:58] <sacho> the dropdown doesn't have that class.
[01:23:37] <obert> what a naming
[01:23:43] <Olambataar> None of these events will attach properly. As seen in http://jsfiddle.net/N6G45/1/ it works if I set onchange and onclick in the markup though
[01:24:21] <sacho> you aren't listening to me.
[01:26:01] <sacho> You are trying to select an element with the class addableDropdown_onSelect. There is no such element. That's why your first .on function doesn't do anything.
[01:26:52] <sacho> The second one doesn't do anything because the remove button is never added. The remove button is never added because the conditional you use for it fails. The conditional fails because it tries to select an element(the container) before it has been added to the DOM
[01:28:47] <Olambataar> I think I have used '.on('click', function () {});
[01:28:53] <liotur> join #General
[01:28:54] <Olambataar>  in the proper way
[01:29:07] <AdamPDotty> join #Major
[01:29:14] <obert> #Colonel
[01:29:28] <Olambataar> and it IS the recommended way of adding event handlers to dynamically created controls, right?
[01:29:55] <sacho> I think you're completely ignoring what I'm saying
[01:30:03] <seutje> Olambataar: yeah, but you should set the context to a higher element, one that won't change
[01:30:35] <sacho> here's a half-working example - it now adds the event listeners for the first select, but doesn't add them for your future created ones(I haven't looked at the code that creates them to know why)
[01:30:35] <Olambataar> sacho: whoa, sorry, I missed your last messages :P
[01:30:36] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/N6G45/3/
[01:30:40] <seutje> Olambataar: like $('#static-wrapper').on('click', '.dynamic-element', function(){...});
[01:33:21] <sacho> at any rate, what seutje is saying is the better course of action - If you're adding elements into a container, instead of having to bind new event listeners to the newly created elements, binding event listeners to a parent container using the delegation option of on is much simpler.
[01:33:53] <seutje> even if that parent container ends up being body :P
[01:35:19] <Olambataar> sacho, seutje: Okay, now I get it. Thanks :)
[02:16:11] <boytoy> Which div slider would you guys use? https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe or https://github.com/viljamis/ResponsiveSlides.js ?
[02:36:03] <lessless> what should I use to fire event when was new value in <select> has been selected?
[02:36:12] <lessless> .on() or change()
[02:37:06] <Cork> lessless: change is a shorthand for on('change'
[02:38:06] <lessless> thnx
[02:39:07] <JesperA> youÂ´re welcome lessless
[02:47:27] <amaroks> hola
[02:51:27] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/imotil/1/edit using the wonderful http://swipejs.com -- how do I apply custom CSS3 transitions to the slides?
[02:54:39] <Tulip> Hi, I have used custom flexslider on hover effect and generated thumbnail and caption for it now I want to link thumbanail to the slide url I have specified in the backend, I have used jQuery to show the slide url in the anchor tag but somehow anchor tag is not getting worked on normal left but its opening generated url on middle click of mouse. I want to go to that url on click of mouse
[02:58:04] <seutje> boytoy: it already uses css transitions
[03:00:10] <Tulip> Hi, I have used custom flexslider on hover effect and generated thumbnail and caption for it now I want to link thumbanail to the slide url I have specified in the backend, I have used jQuery to show the slide url in the anchor tag but somehow anchor tag is not getting worked on normal left but its opening generated url on middle click of mouse. I want to go to that url on click of mouse
[03:19:46] <lejocelyn> about relative path and Javascript code, when javascript code is executed, it's always from where the browser sees it?
[03:19:47] <lejocelyn> or is it relative to the original file location?
[03:19:49] <Cork> lejocelyn: when you load a script its through a <script> tag in the html
[03:19:49] <Cork> and relative paths is in relation to the document its loaded in
[03:20:12] <lejocelyn> Cork: I couldn't read your answer...
[03:20:45] <lejocelyn> what's going on?
[03:20:49] <Cork> net split
[03:20:52] <Cork> just wait it out
[03:21:19] <duderion> hi guys, does anyone of you know a plugin that supports adjustable image effects (like sepia, black to white, blur effect and so on)
[03:21:27] <duderion> even commercial
[03:21:36] <Cork> lejocelyn: when you load a script its through a <script> tag in the html
[03:21:40] <Cork> and relative paths is in relation to the document its loaded in
[03:30:08] <boytoy_> seutje: interesting -- so i must modify https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe/blob/master/swipe.js#L120-L173 or is there an easier way?
[03:31:11] <lejocelyn> Cork: thank you, I thought I would be like that
[03:31:46] <seutje> boytoy_: oh, u want custom ones
[03:32:00] <lejocelyn> then, it doesn't explain why my Jqeury $.ajax stops  on success: function(data)
[03:32:23] <ingnu> hi
[03:32:25] <lejocelyn> checking with Firebug
[03:33:06] <lejocelyn> what could be the reasons for the script to stop at success :function(datya)
[03:33:08] <lejocelyn> ?
[03:34:52] <ingnu> I've followed the following page to create my first plugin: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/stateful-plugins-with-widget-factory/, but when do var bar = ...progressbar(), bar is a dom object, not a progressbar object, can someone help me to find out why ?
[03:34:55] <seutje> boytoy_: not sure tbh, might be worth trying to just define it in CSS and see if it overrides it
[03:34:57] <boytoy_> seutje: yeah gotta do some fading
[03:35:06] <boytoy_> cool will do that
[03:43:31] <ingnu> for the record, if I could give more information, I would, but I just done a copy/paste of the code in the documentation without any modification, and try to .progressbar() on a span element, then to access the options field directly (by doing bar.options.value, just like the sample code)
[03:44:13] <ingnu> I tryied a alert(bar.attr('id')) just to be sure, and I get the id of the dom element, instead an expected 'undefined'
[03:46:39] <ingnu> (or a 'bar.attr is not a function' message, in fact)
[03:47:58] <ynonperek> hi all
[03:48:13] <seutje> ingnu: you have to call the widget methods on that dom element
[03:48:15] <ynonperek> what's the best plugin for auto complete ?
[03:48:33] <seutje> ingnu: like the example shows: var bar = $("<div></div>").appendTo("body").progressbar({ value: 20 }); bar.progressbar( "value", 50 );
[03:49:17] <ingnu> yes, that works, but look under the 'The Widget Factory: Under the Hood' section
[03:49:46] <ingnu> it appears that you can call plugin methods and fields directly
[03:49:50] <ingnu> or am I wrong ?
[03:50:24] <seutje> ingnu: and you're missing the data call?
[03:50:49] <ingnu> no, I added the data call when I try to access methods directly
[03:51:07] <ingnu> but
[03:51:22] <ingnu> when doing it, I get a 'cannot convert bar to object' message
[03:51:30] <seutje> odd
[03:51:40] <ingnu> var pb = $('#progressabr').progressbar({ value: 20 }).data('progressbar');
[03:51:40] <ingnu>         alert(pb.options.value);
[03:51:44] <seutje> I don't even know if widget factory still works the way it's described here
[03:52:02] <ingnu> it could explain my issue :D
[03:53:41] <seutje> ingnu: http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[03:53:45] <seutje> check the section under instance
[03:54:01] <seutje> looks like u gotta prepend the widget name with 'ui-' ? o.O
[03:57:33] <ingnu> prefixing by ui changes nothing :/
[03:57:53] <sunbeam> for some reason, datepicker cannot have 2 instances for 2 fields, any idea how come?
[03:58:10] <sunbeam> (note, this extra field  where I use datepicker on gets created after the page is loaded)
[04:00:41] <seutje> ingnu: aha! http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide10
[04:00:56] <chachan> hey there, I'm using bootstrap, I have a table, the first column are checkboxes, the rest of columns trigger a modal for edition. But I'm having problems with checkboxes, they're not working naturally, any suggestion?
[04:00:58] <seutje> so .progressbar('instance')
[04:02:52] <seutje> chachan: can you be a bit more specific than "not working naturally"?
[04:03:06] <seutje> like... clicking them does't toggle them?
[04:03:21] <seutje> cause then it's prolly a handler preventing default or some shit
[04:03:33] <chachan> seutje, sure, check and un-check actions don't make any change on status
[04:03:51] <chachan> seutje, yes
[04:03:57] <seutje> chachan: but u can still tab to them and use space to toggle them?
[04:04:12] <chachan> seutje, haven't tried that, let me see
[04:04:23] <seutje> cause yeah, then it's prolly a click handler
[04:04:45] <chachan> seutje, no, space them don't work neither
[04:05:17] <seutje> oh, then it might be a change handler doing and extra toggle
[04:05:20] <okdamn> hey dudes
[04:05:27] <okdamn> why .show('slide',{direction:'right'},100);
[04:05:33] <okdamn> doesn't shows the hidden element?
[04:05:39] <seutje> chachan: chrome allows you to break on any instance of a certain event type
[04:05:43] <okdamn> it slides but doesn't shows the element
[04:05:46] <okdamn> why please?
[04:05:50] <okdamn> it's strange
[04:05:56] <seutje> chachan: you can then see where the handler is coming from
[04:06:00] <okdamn> shouldn't that also showing the element?
[04:06:08] <seutje> or rather, what the handler is, which will help you figure out where it's coming from
[04:06:28] <seutje> chachan: if they're jQuery events, they can be accessed by using $_data(elem, 'events')
[04:06:59] <seutje> (when .on was used, u'll have to pass the element on was called on, not the selector that was passed)
[04:07:42] <chachan> seutje, I did $(":checkbox :not(:first)").click, without () to see which code is handling that event and that's not mine, is that what you are talking about?
[04:07:55] <okdamn> hey what about
[04:07:55] <okdamn> show('slide',{direction:'right'},100);
[04:08:00] <okdamn> why not showing element?
[04:08:10] <seutje> chachan: that will just give you the source for $.fn.click
[04:08:37] <chachan> seutje, let me list the events for a single checkbox
[04:08:44] <okdamn> any suggestion please?
[04:09:00] <okdamn> how to slide element from left to right showing it from hidden ?
[04:10:37] <chachan> seutje, sorry, what do you mean with $_data?
[04:10:55] <seutje> chachan: sorry, I meant $>_data
[04:11:00] <seutje> holy ass
[04:11:05] <seutje> I meant $._data
[04:11:23] <seutje> as in, the static _data method on the jQuery object
[04:11:48] <chachan> $._data($(":checkbox").eq(1), 'events') // it's throwing me undefined
[04:13:32] <seutje> u need to pass DOM element if I'm not mistaken
[04:13:43] <seutje> so $._data($(":checkbox")[0], 'events')
[04:14:09] <seutje> also see ?g visualevent
[04:14:11] <bot-t> seutje, Allan Jardine | Reflections | Visual Event - http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[04:16:02] <chachan> seutje, ok, I got a response, should I search the handler, right?
[04:17:12] <seutje> yeah, like $._data($(":checkbox")[0], 'events').click[0].handler should give u the function bound as the first click handler on that element
[04:17:48] <seutje> likewise $._data($(":checkbox")[0], 'events').change[0].handler will give the first handler for change events on that element
[04:17:59] <seutje> note that these only show events bound by jQuery
[04:18:04] <chachan> hm
[04:18:16] <okdamn> hey how to show+slide right an element?
[04:19:23] <okdamn> anybody alive here?
[04:19:29] <okdamn> everyone died?
[04:19:33] <okdamn> Zzzzzzzzzzz
[04:20:42] <chachan> seutje, ok, has not events
[04:21:18] <chachan> $.data($(":checkbox")[1], 'events') // throws undefined
[04:21:39] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[04:21:39] <chachan> I'm going to check the parents
[04:22:04] <chachan> yes, $._
[04:22:12] <chachan> throws undefined
[04:22:25] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[04:22:48] <chachan> 1.9.1
[04:24:02] <ingnu> seutje: OK, I managed to make it work by writing the simpliest code: (function($, undefined) { $.widget( "cyca.folder", { folder_id: function() { return 'test'; } }); }(jQuery));
[04:24:16] <ingnu> then var pb = $('#folder_handle_0').folder(); alert(pb.folder('folder_id'));
[04:24:29] <Cork> are you sure you have any events bound on that element?
[04:24:35] <Cork> chachan: ^
[04:24:56] <ingnu> so this works, but according to the documentation, I should be able to do alert(pb.folder_id) in some way
[04:25:34] <ingnu> but adding data() function to my call breaks the pb object...
[04:25:52] <chachan> Cork, no, I don't have any event bound on that element
[04:26:05] <Cork> chachan: then undefined is expected
[04:26:17] <chachan> but they don't toggle status when I click them
[04:27:07] <chachan> they are inside a table, I checked events for td and tr and I still get undefined for both of them
[04:27:12] <Cork> chachan: you mean the browser don't react to the click?
[04:27:19] <chachan> Cork, right
[04:27:40] <Cork> chachan: have you checked if any element covers it? (transparent)
[04:28:37] <chachan> no, they are not other element, I'm going to paste it
[04:28:40] <chachan> hold on
[04:32:45] <constantin_mike> hello
[04:32:57] <constantin_mike> i need a bit of help with bootstrap/modal
[04:33:09] <okdamn> hey
[04:33:09] <constantin_mike> i want to open a modal lightbox but with content coming through ajax
[04:33:12] <okdamn> WTFFF show('slide', 10000,{direction: 'right'})
[04:33:16] <okdamn> why doesn't works?
[04:33:25] <constantin_mike> i simply cannot figure out how to make it work, except for static content
[04:33:36] <okdamn> ??
[04:33:56] <constantin_mike> does anybode have a clue?
[04:34:24] <okdamn> everybody dided today
[04:34:27] <okdamn> nobody alive here
[04:34:56] <constantin_mike> :)
[04:37:20] <chachan> Cork, seutje, this is my HTML http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/gbBr8/
[04:38:52] <chachan> as you can see, first checkbox works fine, but remaining don't
[04:40:12] <constantin_mike> can someone help me with bootstrap/modal?!
[04:40:44] <chachan> constantin_mike, sure
[04:40:45] <Cork> chachan: your checkboxes need a name and a value
[04:41:05] <Cork> chachan: else they can't be checked
[04:41:26] <chachan> Cork, first one doesn't have a name and a value
[04:41:39] <constantin_mike> chachan, my problem is that i want to open a modal but with content from ajax call but trying to put the URL-to-be-called in href attribute doesn't work
[04:42:05] <chachan> constantin_mike, hold on
[04:42:10] <Cork> chachan: none of them do, and that is the problem
[04:42:11] <constantin_mike> yep, okay :D
[04:42:43] <Cork> chachan: <input type="checkbox" data-id="10"> needs to be <input type="checkbox" data-id="10" name="check" value="10">
[04:47:47] <chachan> Cork, still having the same problem =/
[04:48:38] <chachan> constantin_mike, on your modal HTML, put element with IDs where you can change before trigger the event
[04:50:00] <chachan> constantin_mike, then you can call and trigger using something like http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/VdB3m/
[04:50:05] <constantin_mike> chachan, you mean: first load ajax content into hidden box, then trigger the modal with the id of the box
[04:51:06] <chachan> constantin_mike, yeah, you initial modal with have, for instances, empty divs, so you can fill them up after your event
[04:51:26] <chachan> will have*
[04:51:47] <constantin_mike> chachan, okay, will do. it's a good idea. thanks for help
[04:52:03] <chachan> my english sucks, sorry for that
[04:52:11] <constantin_mike> no problem :)
[04:56:08] <chachan> constantin_mike, btw, I use something like data-content if you need to create modal based on specific data that you already have on render moment. I'm not sure if that was clear enough
[04:56:28] <Cork> chachan: http://jsfiddle.net/gbBr8/2/
[04:58:37] <constantin_mike> chachan, will try that also
[04:59:11] <chachan> Cork, what kind of useful sorcery was that? :D :D
[04:59:21] <Cork> chachan: check the javascript
[04:59:34] <Cork> you have the alert bootstrap bound to the table
[04:59:38] <chachan> Cork, yeah, it's totally working
[04:59:42] <Cork> so the click from the checkbox bubbles
[05:00:00] <Cork> and causes the bootstrap to preventDefault
[05:00:04] <chachan> Cork, how did you figure that out?
[05:00:10] <Cork> my stopping the propagation you get it working
[05:00:35] <Cork> chachan: 1. disabling javascript "fixed" it, 2. unloading bootstrap-modal fixed it
[05:00:45] <Cork> 3. event.stopPropagation() fixed it
[05:01:14] <chachan> awesome work, thanks, I did learn something today ;)
[05:01:43] <chachan> one more happy client, closing a ticket :)
[05:02:05] <amaroks> anyone can help determine why this jquery plugin https://github.com/amaroks/simpleSlider can be attached to 1 element per page?
[05:03:43] <Cork> amaroks: all variables in the plugin except for the arguments are global
[05:04:19] <Cork> amaroks: https://github.com/amaroks/simpleSlider/blob/master/js/jquery.simpleslider.js#L24

[05:04:42] <Cork> https://github.com/amaroks/simpleSlider/blob/master/js/jquery.simpleslider.js#L29
[05:04:45] <Cork> and so on
[05:05:31] <amaroks> Cork: isn't var myvar. is what makes it global?
[05:05:42] <Cork> no its what makes it local
[05:05:43] <amaroks> How do I make the variable for current object only?
[05:05:53] <Cork> var the_name;
[05:06:00] <amaroks> Cork: so I should add var in front
[05:06:03] <Cork> yes
[05:06:08] <amaroks> Cork: Thank you
[05:06:13] <Cork> you should ALWAYS do that
[05:06:31] <Cork> amaroks: tip try "use strict";
[05:06:54] <Cork> if you use a modern browser it will throw errors for this kind of problems
[05:07:09] <amaroks> Cork:  I will try Thanks
[05:07:30] <Ukto> hey guys... inside of a working .click(){}, how can I call $(".genHTML").toggle("slow"); on a live html using .on?  $(".genHTML").on("toggle","slow"); doesnt do anything
[05:08:04] <Ukto> or jquery throws an awkward error having access issues
[05:08:24] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'target', function() { $(".genHTML").toggle("slow"); });
[05:08:40] <Ukto> but i have to click it for that to execute right?
[05:08:41] <Cork> replace target with what you used before .click() before
[05:08:47] <Cork> ues
[05:08:49] <Cork> *yes
[05:08:54] <Ukto> i have already clicked osmething else, working from within its click function
[05:09:02] <Cork> if you ron $(".genHTML").toggle("slow"); it will just work
[05:09:09] <Cork> *run
[05:09:19] <Cork> no need to do anything special
[05:09:40] <macsim> hi, I try to load js from a page, it's work but I'm not sure to doing it right here is the code I used https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5195580 is it the good way ? thanks
[05:10:15] <Ukto> Corey: doesnt. i will have to make a jsfiddle of this to get more help. thanks.
[05:13:23] <ggggg> jj
[05:13:37] <ggggg> nhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[05:13:40] <ggggg> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[05:13:42] <ggggg> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[05:15:03] <Ukto> Cork: an example, not exactly what I am doing, of what I mean is: http://jsfiddle.net/T83Xy/
[05:16:08] <Cork> Ukto: ok?
[05:16:22] <Cork> and... you want to fade in the charts?
[05:16:23] <Ukto> i need to .toggle that generated div html
[05:16:26] <Ukto> errr
[05:16:32] <Ukto> stupid jsfiddle
[05:16:33] <Ukto> one sec
[05:16:37] <superdo> hi
[05:16:50] <Ukto> http://jsfiddle.net/pstcF/
[05:16:51] <Ukto> try that one
[05:16:53] <superdo> any idea how to loop trough an objects context-attributes ?
[05:17:26] <Cork> superdo: whats context-attribute?
[05:18:05] <apeiros_> hi there. it seems jQuery 1.9 no longer executes $.event.special.NAME.setup. I haven't seen any mention of this in the upgrade guide for 1.9 - anything I need to know about that?
[05:18:39] <Cork> Ukto: http://jsfiddle.net/pstcF/1/
[05:18:50] <superdo> Cork: i have a soap xml, parsed with Jquery.. and..
[05:19:08] <Cork> apeiros_: no jquery 1.9 should execute setup
[05:19:20] <superdo> the data i need is in the context->attributes "part" if I see the result with Firebug
[05:19:45] <Cork> ok, so you need to traverse a dom tree??
[05:19:47] <Cork> -?
[05:19:50] <superdo> yes
[05:19:58] <superdo> but its spec. soap xml thingy
[05:20:25] <Cork> $(xml).find('context').each(function() {})
[05:20:43] <Cork> $(this).attr('part')
[05:20:52] <apeiros_> Cork: hm, indeed, it does. the bug was in an unrelated piece of my code. odd. (it bound to the wrong event)
[05:20:57] <superdo> checking..
[05:22:15] <Ukto> Cork: sorry. here. http://jsfiddle.net/6kESS/
[05:22:20] <Ukto> thats exactly what I can't make work
[05:22:39] <Ukto> sorry agian, and thanks for the help. its really appreciated
[05:23:17] <superdo> Cork, I modded a bit your code, but now works. thank you :)
[05:23:58] <Cork> Ukto: http://jsfiddle.net/6kESS/2/
[05:24:43] <Ukto> cork: clicking doesnt rotate
[05:24:53] <Cork> Ukto: depends on your browser
[05:24:57] <Ukto> chrome
[05:25:01] <Ukto> :P
[05:25:05] <Cork> version
[05:25:18] <Ukto> 25.0.1364.172 m
[05:25:29] <Ukto> that rotate script worked on everything i tested
[05:25:48] <Ukto> which is why I was wanting to use it. didnt think accessing the live data would be an issue heh
[05:26:25] <Cork> Ukto: http://jsfiddle.net/6kESS/3/
[05:26:39] <Cork> Ukto: well it wasn't in the page so...
[05:28:22] <Ukto> its on the page..
[05:31:02] <Ukto> either wya, i got it not. thanks alot cork :)
[05:31:03] <Ukto> your awse :)
[05:31:07] <fotoflo> Hello all, just trying to understand $.when().done() â€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/PBSaX/1/      anyone help ?   I think i have to do something with deferred objects in my getPlaylistsByTag function?
[05:42:54] <fotoflo> hmmm, my internet connection is being really flaky, did anyone reply to me
[05:42:55] <fotoflo> ?
[05:46:27] <seutje> fotoflo: the deferred for each gets resolved before the ajax requests return
[05:46:39] <seutje> I think
[05:47:56] <fotoflo> seutje: so how should this be done?
[05:49:08] <dingdong_> anyone else koow the pattern of design
[05:49:09] <dingdong_> ?
[05:49:18] <Trudko> guys I want to add thead to table but I am not successf ul what am I doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/akevez/2/edit
[05:49:20] <dingdong_> anyone else kown the pattern of design
[05:52:49] <seutje> fotoflo: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/PBSaX/2/
[05:53:38] <fotoflo> seutje: ok ill give this a try
[05:53:38] <seutje> shit sry lol
[05:53:54] <seutje> fotoflo: http://jsfiddle.net/PBSaX/3/ when instead of then :P
[05:54:31] <dingdong_> Does anybody know the design pattern?
[05:54:38] <seutje> fotoflo: I'm assuming your getPlaylistByTag function returns the deferred object when making the ajax call
[05:55:12] <seutje> like getPlaylistByTag = function() { return $.ajax(...); } <-- that return statement is pretty essential
[05:58:48] <fotoflo> seutje: it doesnt
[05:59:01] <fotoflo> seutje: il can fix that, but I'm getting def. has no method when
[06:01:37] <seutje> fotoflo: oh lol I'm stupid
[06:01:56] <fotoflo> seutje: hmm I'm using jQuery 1.8.3 â€¦ maybe thats why?
[06:02:14] <seutje> no, it's prolly cause I was misusing the API
[06:03:09] <fotoflo> okâ€¦ so how does this work?
[06:03:48] <juria_roberts> I have an iframe inside a div.Im doing an innerhtml of the div and putting that inside another div.Will the iframe along with its innercontents be transferred as well?
[06:04:29] <seutje> fotoflo: well it doesn't, obviously
[06:04:42] <fotoflo> hehe, right, but how should it be done?
[06:06:57] <Braden`> Is there an easy way to decode json in jquery?
[06:07:14] <seutje> fotoflo: liek this, perhaps? http://jsfiddle.net/PBSaX/4/
[06:07:31] <seutje> ?parsejson
[06:07:32] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[06:07:49] <seutje> Braden`: ^
[06:08:10] <computer2000> offtopic sorry but on stackoverflow, if every answer on a topic has the same legit right to be marked as 'correct answer', what do i do as initiator?
[06:09:08] <JesperA> follow your heart
[06:09:27] <seutje> nobody cares about SO cred anyway
[06:09:36] <fotoflo> seutje: whats  def.when.apply?
[06:09:47] <fotoflo> cannot call method apply of undefined
[06:09:53] <superdo> Cork: have a sec? why I get the above error : http://paste.laravel.com/kOt
[06:09:58] <computer2000> JesperA: seutje: now i feel better!
[06:09:58] <seutje> I didn't write that
[06:10:07] <seutje> fotoflo: where are u getting that from?
[06:10:18] <seutje> pretty sure my example had $.when.apply
[06:10:30] <fotoflo> whoops, I'm dyslexic ;-)
[06:11:01] <seutje> but but... u didn't misspell dyslexic (I almost did :x)
[06:11:32] <seutje> entirely unsure if this will work as expected though
[06:11:34] <mipo> hi :)
[06:11:39] <fotoflo> it works~
[06:11:41] <fotoflo> !
[06:11:54] <fotoflo> i understand we are pushing the deferred objects into an array
[06:12:08] <fotoflo> but I idont understand what we're doing with the $.when.apply
[06:13:33] <furyFoo> Is there any way to display two different portion of the same CSS sprite in the same DIV ?
[06:13:34] <furyFoo>  I have a 400px tall sprite and I want to dynamically display certain portion of it i.e. 0 to 50 and 300 to 350 .
[06:14:43] <JesperA> asign it to div:before or div:after, i think some browsers have support for multiple backgrounds in divs to but yeah
[06:15:38] <seutje> fotoflo: we're calling $.when using null as the this object and piping the array as an argument list
[06:15:55] <seutje> sorta like doing $.when(def[0], def[1], ...)
[06:16:05] <Braden`> request.done(function (response, textStatus, jqXHR){ <-- For ajax, what would be the value of "response"?
[06:16:15] <seutje> cause we need to convert our array to a regular arguments list, apply is perfect
[06:16:32] <seutje> the null can probably be anything, don't think it matters
[06:16:50] <furyFoo> What if I need 5 active portions ? Would using the canvas element work ?
[06:17:17] <seutje> Braden`: whatever the server responded
[06:17:40] <seutje> Braden`: if the ajax request has a datatype of json set, I believe the response will be a parsed object instead of a JSON string
[06:17:59] <seutje> fotoflo: did that make sense>?
[06:18:23] <fotoflo> seutje: i didn't find apply in the jquery docs
[06:18:32] <seutje> ?mdn function.apply
[06:18:33] <b-ot> seutje: Function.prototype.apply method - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[06:18:37] <seutje> it's just javascript :)
[06:18:39] <bot-t> seutje, Closures | jQuery Learning Center - Closures are an extension of the concept of scope. With closures, functions have access to variables that were available in the scope where the function was created. If that seems confusing, don’t ... http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/closures/
[06:18:48] <seutje> bot-t: NOH!
[06:18:50] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "NOH!" in jQuery Docs.
[06:18:54] <seutje> SHADDAP!

[06:19:25] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "I have a bootable WinME and I'm not afraid to use it!" in jQuery Docs.
[06:19:39] <Braden`> What is jqXHR?
[06:19:45] <seutje> doesn't respond well to threats it seems
[06:20:02] <seutje> Braden`: jQuery flavoured XMLHttpRequest object
[06:20:51] <seutje> Braden`: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jqXHR
[06:21:17] <seutje> those blue underlined thingies in the docs... they're links, u can click em :P
[06:21:25] <fotoflo> seutje: reading up on the apply method...
[06:22:10] <seutje> fotoflo: it's useful for forcing the "this" context within the function and to convert an array of arguments to a list of them
[06:22:11] <fotoflo> oh, so apply takes the array def and converts it to elements
[06:22:35] <seutje> sorta, I guess
[06:22:47] <Trudko> Guys is this seletor ok for finding out td inside of thead inside of table? if I dont have class or id $("#t").find("thead > tr > td")
[06:23:31] <seutje> fotoflo: it just makes the function interpret it as being "first argument", "second argument", ... instead of being a single argument that's an array
[06:23:35] <fotoflo> right
[06:23:37] <fotoflo> i get it
[06:23:40] <fotoflo> thanks
[06:23:43] <seutje> $.when(def) would be an array as argument !
[06:23:45] <seutje> $.when(def) would be an array as argument 1
[06:24:25] <seutje> apply is like "run this function with this context and these arguments plz"
[06:25:45] <fotoflo> and fn.apply( myThis, [a, b, c]) calls fn with a as arg1 b as arg2 and c as arg3, with myThis as this
[06:30:28] <seutje> fotoflo: exactly
[06:30:44] <seutje> (assuming arg1 is the first and isn't preceded by arg0) :P
[06:47:11] <ingnu> seutje: thank you, I still can't directly access to methods and properties but it will work for now on
[06:47:16] <ingnu> bye !

[07:06:11] <pachet> ^
[07:06:12] <seutje> ah
[07:06:32] <pachet> i'm still stuck in the past with that one :[
[07:06:45] <seutje> s'ok
[07:06:56] <seutje> frontend dev's a thug life
[07:07:42] <Tsd_> hmmm it does'nt solve that problem
[07:07:52] <Tsd_> i use ejs to render a list
[07:08:20] <Tsd_> after putting it into my html everything is in normal charakters
[07:08:30] <Tsd_> but it is rendered as string
[07:08:33] <Tsd_> not as html code
[07:08:51] <Tsd_> looks in the source code like
[07:09:52] <dcherman> Tsd_: if i'm understanding this right you have a string with html that you literally want the user to see, use $( "<div>" ).text( myRenderedTemplate )
[07:09:59] <Tsd_> <ul> '<li> item 1 <ul> <li>item 12</li><li>item 13</li></ul></li><li>item2</li>'</ul>
[07:11:09] <Tsd_> no @dcherman
[07:11:24] <Tsd_> i get some html back from my ejs template
[07:11:36] <Tsd_> unfortunately it is with ascii code
[07:12:00] <Tsd_> after put it into my html via .html(content)
[07:12:03] <dcherman> Tsd_: can you make a jsfiddle demo?  that would probably help us help you.
[07:12:04] <pachet> can you paste the escaped output somewhere
[07:12:10] <Tsd_> the characters are displayed as string
[07:12:10] <pachet> or that^
[07:12:39] <Tsd_> hmm it is a bit complicated because it is an mvc project
[07:12:43] <Tsd_> but i try it
[07:12:52] <masentinel900> Could someone help me?
[07:13:14] <pachet> then just paste the output
[07:17:43] <Tsd_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sebtra/zupvC/
[07:19:00] <Tsd_> @pachet @dcherman @seutje
[07:20:24] <masentinel900> Plz!!!
[07:20:47] <dcherman> Tsd_: it's already escaped from HTML which id why it isn't working - you mentioned MVC, are you escaping this on the server side?
[07:22:31] <Tsd_> i get it from the ejs file
[07:22:47] <Tsd_> there i iterate through an nested object
[07:23:30] <dcherman> Tsd_: is EJS escaping html then?  is there any way that you can tell it to spit out literal HTML?
[07:23:30] <Tsd_> i do not escape it knowingly
[07:24:11] <greengriminal> I am trying to get the jquery dialog to appear upon selecting a number of cells. It seem that the following https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5193107 does not work.
[07:24:27] <seutje> Tsd_: http://jsfiddle.net/zupvC/1/ ?
[07:24:32] <seutje> so awkward
[07:24:45] <seutje> the outer wrapper isn't escaped which makes it a lot more annoying
[07:25:34] <soee_> hi, how can i remove class 'foo' from all elements that dont have both classes 'foo bar' ?
[07:25:35] <dcherman> seutje: yea, that's why i'd personally go with a "fix this at the template" solution.  it's doable on the client, but awkward and confusing
[07:25:55] <seutje> Tsd_: basically, I parse it, grab the text (the escaped part) and pipe that back into the parsed wrapper, but as html, not as text
[07:26:11] <alesandro> I use jQuery-File-Upload and make a XHR request on upload
[07:27:02] <superdo> hi
[07:27:04] <alesandro> Chrome devtools show me that the response code is 200 ... but jQuery (jqXHR) does always call the "fail" function instead of "done"
[07:27:09] <Tsd_> hmmm thanks seutje it looks a bit strange but it works
[07:27:13] <superdo> anyone using handlebars.js on chrome?
[07:27:17] <Tsd_> :D
[07:27:21] <alesandro> what could be the reason why jQuery is doing so?
[07:27:25] <alesandro> thanks :)
[07:27:41] <ryanneufeld> superdo: no, no one, ever
[07:27:50] <superdo> why?
[07:28:03] <superdo> page renders well on firefox, but chrome..
[07:28:04] <ryanneufeld> I was being sarcastic
[07:28:19] <superdo> no error in console
[07:28:37] <ryanneufeld> well, you'd probably be best checking in the handlebars support channels
[07:30:08] <superdo> yeah
[07:30:14] <superdo> thx

[07:35:56] <PsychicTWIG> Should you reqire I can explain further
[07:36:38] <PsychicTWIG> The issue comes in within the domManip function
[07:37:19] <lil-murph> If i put a "done" on a Deferred that's already resolved, is it immediatly executed, or something like setTimeout(..,0)
[07:38:46] <PsychicTWIG> So, would anyone be able to assist me with the domManip section of JQuery?
[07:46:50] <Tsd_> the solution: <%== put your html unescaped into an ejs file @pachet @dcherman @seutje
[07:47:42] <loincloth> does anyone know why my Dialog widgets would position overflowing off the top on first load but properly centered after that?
[07:48:03] <loincloth> are there general gotchas there?
[07:48:30] <loincloth> smells like a timing issue, like something needs to wait for something else to load or finish {whatever}
[07:51:34] <PsychicTWIG> Would anyone be able to assist with Fragment script loading
[07:51:54] <loincloth> not sure what you mean by that

[08:31:01] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[08:32:50] <Stephen> Hola
[08:35:34] <masentinel900> <Stephen>: Where are you from?
[08:43:44] <harumph> anyone know of a good library for slide shows, specifically for background images.
[08:44:14] <superdo> hey
[08:44:47] <superdo> guys what the wrong with this code part? problems only in Chrome.. http://hastebin.com/quxubimihi.coffee
[08:44:53] <superdo> *what's
[08:50:04] <velts> superdo: what error are you getting?
[08:50:54] <sorre> hi, i'm using a rotator with videos embedded on an iframe which seem to avoid all my events. How should I embed videos if not using the iframe? (youtube)
[08:52:01] <itatitat> guys Im having a problem with ajax. I'm making some request by console, with curl, but later, my script always get error, I havent response from the server. But by using console I have it
[08:52:10] <itatitat> how can work only the console?, my script jquery should make the shame no?
[08:52:11] <superdo> velts: nothing
[08:52:43] <velts> sorre: https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters
[08:53:09] <superdo> velts, the data contains the xml, but in the each loop logging the index or data doesnt do anything
[08:53:23] <harumph> hi guys. i'm looking for a library for doing background-image slideshows. slidesjs is only good for images.
[08:53:28] <harumph> anyone know one?
[08:53:42] <superdo> velts, works well in FF, and all IE
[08:54:05] <velts> any chance you service could return json instead of XML?
[08:54:17] <superdo> guessing that chrome cant handle well the spec tag
[08:54:18] <superdo> no
[08:54:44] <superdo> its a test file not service
[08:55:19] <velts> can you log out the typeof 'data'
[08:56:14] <superdo> yes, and it has the xml data
[08:56:20] <superdo> ohh
[08:56:21] <superdo> sorry
[08:56:43] <superdo> velts, object
[08:56:55] <velts> hmm
[08:57:26] <itatitat> guys, im making a simple get request ajax, but I've always readystate=1, and error, no response
[08:57:29] <itatitat> what happening?
[08:57:33] <superdo> i dont know if this is the right was to parse a soap xml, found on stacko
[08:57:38] <superdo> *way
[08:58:02] <sorre> velts that didnt help much
[08:58:21] <velts> not sure this will help, but could you try the other .each format -> $.each( myArray, function(){ });
[08:59:00] <velts> itatitat: jsfiddle it for us
[08:59:06] <itatitat> o
[08:59:09] <itatitat> ok
[08:59:09] <velts> so we can see your code
[08:59:20] <superdo> velts, ok i try
[09:00:50] <itatitat> velts:  http://jsfiddle.net/CqdSx/
[09:01:46] <velts> itatitat: so you are never getting your response to log out?
[09:02:04] <itatitat> yes, from now I have only readystate=1
[09:03:07] <itatitat> why?
[09:03:19] <itatitat> I make the same request in my console, with curl, and I have response
[09:03:50] <velts> try running it with an error condidtion
[09:03:51] <velts> http://jsfiddle.net/CqdSx/1/
[09:04:00] <velts> see what prints out
[09:04:18] <itatitat> thx
[09:06:04] <itatitat> velts: only I see error:
[09:06:28] <itatitat> my url is "http://domain.com/somthing.php
[09:06:34] <itatitat> but I never had an error
[09:07:17] <velts> so its going into the error function for your request
[09:07:32] <NoiseEee> itatitat: and same origin policy is respected?
[09:07:52] <itatitat> yes, making the same request in my console with curl I have the response
[09:07:57] <itatitat> then is not a question of ips
[09:08:43] <superdo> velts, same. but strangely chrome doesnt escape well the z\\:row -> z\:row
[09:09:00] <NoiseEee> itatitat: what do you mean "making the same request in my console with curl" ?  JS doesn't use curl.
[09:09:15] <NoiseEee> and same-origin-policy only applies to JS
[09:10:59] <velts> superdo: log out $(data).find('z\\:row').length before the each
[09:11:09] <superdo> ok
[09:11:25] <velts> see if its actually getting elements
[09:11:41] <itatitat> velts:  curl get the content file, can be that?, I need to get the content instead the response made up with echo in php?
[09:11:53] <superdo> velts, yes, 7
[09:12:02] <superdo> i have seven elements in the xml
[09:12:23] <velts> in chrome?
[09:12:26] <sorre> So i read: don't use the iframe code to embed your youtube videos because the iframe will prevent the click event from propagating up into the main document. On the other hand everyone seems to recommend iframe for youtube video embedding. Can someone point me in the right direction to be able to stop a rotator when on a youtube video?
[09:12:36] <superdo> velts, yes.
[09:13:03] <superdo> velts, grrrrr. i shortened find to "row", now works in chrome, but not in firefox :(
[09:13:26] <superdo> they fck me both
[09:13:35] <velts> seems very weird
[09:13:49] <superdo> yes
[09:13:51] <superdo> what if
[09:14:06] <superdo> i check if browser chrome then do .. and if firefox then do..
[09:14:11] <superdo> lame solution right?
[09:14:18] <velts> yah
[09:14:42] <superdo> surely its about the escaping the : char
[09:16:09] <velts> so you are getting no errors in chrome, it just isn't going in the loop. right?
[09:16:19] <superdo> velts, right
[09:17:05] <velts> can you post the data somewhere?
[09:17:10] <superdo> but again z\\:row length in chrome is 0
[09:17:28] <superdo> yes in pm ok?
[09:17:35] <superdo> i mean  i paste oc
[09:18:44] <velts> yah whereever
[09:22:22] <chris__> Would it be possible to create a script that detects if a user is inpatiently clicking on the same link over and over?
[09:27:38] <muay-guy> Hi, is it correct to ask something related to twitter-bootstrap here? (modal function)

[09:31:15] <mvta> hi mates
[09:31:20] <mvta> I have a strange problem
[09:31:37] <mvta> that I didn't solve
[09:31:38] <mvta> well,
[09:31:44] <mvta> I have a JSON object
[09:31:46] <muay-guy> I'm trying to show some modal div after an ajax call is executed, but it doesn't seem to work (http://jsfiddle.net/fp7SY/4/, for some reason part of the div is showing up here, sorry I can't exactly replicate)
[09:31:49] <mvta> in a callback function
[09:32:07] <mvta> and chrome, firefox etc
[09:32:11] <mvta> understand
[09:32:15] <mvta> data.items.length
[09:32:19] <Lichurec> Hi there :)
[09:32:23] <mvta> but IE8 didn't
[09:32:33] <mvta> and I'm going crazy with this
[09:32:40] <mvta> I tried to $.makeArray
[09:32:43] <mvta> $.map
[09:32:43] <mvta> etc
[09:32:45] <mvta> but...
[09:32:47] <mvta> nothing
[09:32:55] <ladislaw> talk to me
[09:33:15] <mvta> can anybody helps?
[09:33:40] <Lichurec> Is there a reliable way to get a _untransformed_ position of a element who's a child of css transform: scale element ?
[09:42:46] <Lichurec> >.<
[09:42:54] <prishabh> :)
[09:43:11] <Lichurec> Mayday, mayday, we've got a split!
[09:43:27] <prishabh> lolday lolday you go bit
[09:44:34] <Lichurec> Anyway - I need to do sth like this http://jsfiddle.net/lichurec/etsYm/2/
[09:45:02] <Lichurec> "arrow" should point onto the corner of the "link" when placed within scaled element
[09:45:14] <Lichurec> just remove the scale class and re-run
[09:45:56] <Lichurec> AFAIC it's not doable, hence getBoundingClientRect which is a base of position and offset is now transform aware in most browsers
[09:47:26] <scalex000> hi, how can I check if a element has child?
[09:47:39] <ryanneufeld> scalex000: .children().length
[09:47:59] <scalex000> element.childre().length
[09:48:26] <scalex000> do you know a boolean function?
[09:49:09] <Lichurec> scalex000: just do if ($foo.children().length) {}
[09:49:37] <scalex000> thanky
[09:49:38] <Lichurec> or if ( !!$foo.children().length) {} if you really need bool
[09:50:04] <anew> hey guys, i am fetching a page with ajax, but the problem is there is a split second where nothing shows
[09:50:06] <anew> any way to fix this /
[09:50:07] <anew> ?
[09:50:23] <Lichurec> buy a faster server
[09:50:29] <anew> no... i mean
[09:50:31] <anew> i said it wrong
[09:50:47] <anew> if i start on /home/ then go to /profile/ (ajax page)
[09:50:50] <anew> it waits, so correct
[09:50:57] <anew> then i go back to /home/ and back to /profile/
[09:51:01] <anew> it loads /profile/ all over again
[09:51:05] <anew> any type of caching to do here
[09:51:05] <anew> ?
[09:51:17] <ezrafree> anyone know of any good jquery pdf viewers?
[09:52:06] <anew> lichurec ?
[09:53:07] <Lichurec> anew: well - depends on your implementation
[09:53:15] <Lichurec> jQ is a getter here onlyâ€¦
[09:53:28] <anew> 'getter' ?
[09:54:05] <sorre> So i read: don't use the iframe code to embed your youtube videos because the iframe will prevent the click event from propagating up into the main document.

[09:55:32] <djQuery> sorre, look and see how they did it here http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/
[09:55:47] <sorre> djQuery:  ok thanks
[09:56:05] <anew> meh
[09:56:47] <capi> hi
[10:00:01] <sorre> djQuery: im not very sure on where or what to look, their example is not a rotator
[10:02:33] <sorre> djQuery: they dont seem to use iframes anyway
[10:02:44] <newtonianb> do you need to remove the bindings on elements if the parents is getting deleted?
[10:02:55] <newtonianb> if the element gets recreated do the bindings still exist?
[10:03:49] <djQuery> newtonianb, depends on how you bound it see ?.on

[10:04:10] <newtonianb> i thought it was live now?
[10:04:24] <djQuery> live is old
[10:04:34] <Lichurec> live's just a shorthand for .on now
[10:04:44] <Lichurec> if U may call it a shorthand xD
[10:04:54] <djQuery> live doesnt exist at all in newest ver
[10:05:05] <Lichurec> in 2.0 ?
[10:05:32] <Lichurec> ohâ€¦ "removed: 1.9"
[10:05:33] <Lichurec> GOOD
[10:05:35] <newtonianb> oh
[10:05:36] <Lichurec> xD
[10:07:34] <abstortedminds> Random question here:  this is working find in Safari, but in Firefox it has no effect at all, im not sure how I can find out why:  $("#"+ tmp).find('polygon').css('fill','00FFFF');
[10:08:28] <jacobroufa> anyone know why meta refresh breaks my ajax and subsequently, my page? its driving me insane... and i cant get rid of the refresh unfortunately
[10:08:33] <djQuery> abstortedminds, .find('polygon')   ? when was the polygon element added
[10:09:22] <Bubo> How do I get the position to where I have scrolled to on the website? http://puu.sh/2kvt4 As you can see I have scrolled down here, how do I get the TOP position on this window?
[10:09:33] <abstortedminds> djQuery it was there the whole time
[10:10:00] <abstortedminds> well actually, it was added later with ajax
[10:10:01] <djQuery> abstortedminds, there is no such type of element  did you mean .polygon
[10:10:06] <abstortedminds> but it works fine in safari
[10:10:20] <abstortedminds> djQuery its part of the svg spec
[10:10:28] <djQuery> k
[10:10:41] <djQuery> so does ff suport it
[10:10:44] <abstortedminds> yes
[10:10:50] <abstortedminds> it displays correctly
[10:10:54] <abstortedminds> and is shown in the source
[10:11:51] <abstortedminds> i guess how would i approach debugging it
[10:12:33] <abstortedminds> djQuery: https://gist.github.com/remyb/5198037
[10:13:16] <abstortedminds> in safari it finds that polygon based on the nodeID# and fill it in with the css values
[10:14:22] <djQuery> abstortedminds, i dont know i just saw something I didn't recognize is all

[10:16:45] <ZeroBeholder> You guys do much with adding code to test live using the dev consoles? Is there a way to add document.ready code after the page has been loaded?
[10:17:35] <ZeroBeholder> Firebug has been letting me add html elements with inline event triggers-- but now moving all that to a block to test and not going as well as I would have hoped.
[10:18:11] <Fuzai> http://dev.neurobots.net/test/triggertest.html Hi i'm trying to change a form element on click of a checkbox.  It seems that I've got the click of the check box right, but I can't seem to update my text input areas.  Could someone take a look and tell me whats going on?
[10:19:16] <ladislaw> this the proper way to do it? "if($('div#foo').hide()){}"?
[10:19:35] <ladislaw> sorry .... "if($('div#foo').hide()==true){}"?
[10:19:57] <superdo> anyone know a cross-browser xml namespace selecting method?
[10:20:12] <obert> ladislaw: you can remove div too
[10:21:41] <Lichurec> Fuzai:  JSFiddle that plz
[10:21:53] <superdo> nevermind
[10:23:06] <Yatekii> Hey guys, can you help me with this: http://pastebin.com/zRykEiqj Error on l4: Semantic issue: Expected token ')'
[10:23:17] <KWhat_Work> Does anyone know how to use http://api.jqueryui.com/position/ specifically the using: function() {}.
[10:24:56] <abstortedminds> djQuery really simple solution, i added # in front of the hex color
[10:24:58] <abstortedminds> and now firefox works
[10:25:00] <abstortedminds> :\
[10:25:17] <ZeroBeholder> So, my google searches to find my own answer went best with this search "add event trigger with firebug"
[10:25:46] <ZeroBeholder> Any words I'm missing or you think would give me better results for adding event triggered code via the debug console
[10:25:50] <sacho_> ZeroBeholder, what's the point of adding document.ready code after the page has been loaded?
[10:25:51] <boytoy> anybody tried out admobi? does it annoy users or does it give u some nice income?
[10:25:56] <sacho_> simply executing it would do the trick as well.
[10:26:15] <ZeroBeholder> (I am calling the various panes of firebug the dev console).
[10:26:31] <ZeroBeholder> I can't modify the code on the server...
[10:26:33] <rael> in an unordered list , to append a sublevel, can I select </li> somehow
[10:26:42] <sacho_> ok?
[10:26:49] <ZeroBeholder> So, everything I have been doing has been injected locally after load.
[10:26:52] <sacho_> I don't understand what you need
[10:27:15] <gf3> rael: No
[10:27:25] <gf3> rael: You're working with elements, not tags
[10:27:41] <gf3> rael: But whatever you're trying to accomplish it's surely possible
[10:28:03] <ZeroBeholder> To get the various things to work, I've added a button by editing the code in firebug with an onclick="" property.
[10:28:35] <ZeroBeholder> Now that everything works, it is time to throw it in functions that stand on their own and are triggered by .on().
[10:29:07] <ZeroBeholder> .on() stuff that I usually stick in document.ready(). Which is not injecting very well. Sadness.
[10:29:28] <sacho_> You don't *have* to put it in a ready()
[10:29:30] <sacho_> I mean, you still could
[10:29:42] <sacho_> I don't understand the point of doing so
[10:30:16] <ZeroBeholder> I know, but my code might get pushed around, it is in a framework called formboss. document.ready partially idiot proofs it.
[10:30:57] <sacho_> And you lost me again.
[10:31:08] <sacho_> You're adding your code after the page has already loaded, via the dev console.
[10:31:14] <ZeroBeholder> Yes.
[10:31:15] <sacho_> What does what you just said have to do with that?
[10:31:18] <ZeroBeholder> That exactly.
[10:31:30] <ZeroBeholder> Nothing now that you mention it.
[10:31:54] <ZeroBeholder> New google searches immenent.
[10:31:58] <sacho_> How is the code going to get "pushed around", or why does document.ready idiot proof if(note, the document is ready by the time you add your code, so it's irrelevant)
[10:32:25] <ZeroBeholder> The code I am injecting will be emailed for cut/paste into the project.
[10:32:48] <DanyWalker> hi guys, a help please. How i reload a div every minute, without open again if i load anorther page in the same div?
[10:32:53] <ZeroBeholder> But, I can put the stuff in a docready block later and say too bad if my guesses are a shade off.
[10:33:33] <ZeroBeholder> DanyWalker: Take a look at .load() see if that might fit your use case.
[10:33:41] <KWhat_Work> DanyWalker: maybe something like http://api.jquery.com/delay/ ?  I didnt understand the second part of your question.
[10:33:57] <sacho_> ZeroBeholder, sure, you can do that.
[10:34:51] <ZeroBeholder> DanyWalker: Then if that is sufficient to load your content, then put it on a timed element. Those methods are not on the top of my head setTimeout maybe...
[10:36:19] <winterpk> hi all
[10:36:57] <winterpk> Has anyone run into a problem when fading images where the animation is jumpy?  Is so how do I fix this?
[10:37:21] <ZeroBeholder> Got it. I can put my functions in above the </body> tag by editing the HTML.
[10:37:55] <ZeroBeholder> Then I can pump the event triggers in with the command line type textbox at the bottom.
[10:38:26] <DanyWalker> uhm
[10:39:38] <winterpk> Has anyone encountered an issue when animating opacity with images where the anmiation is jumpy?
[10:39:51] <ZeroBeholder> DanyWalker: Can't work with that, use your words. If you are new that is fine, can't be an expert at everything. Explain to the best of your ability.
[10:46:50] <Croves> I have several divs, and inside each one I have several radio buttons. I need to write a script that select all the radios inside that div with the lower value. Any suggestion?
[10:47:02] <eddiemonge> winterpk: do you have an example?
[10:47:48] <eddiemonge> Croves: use context searching and .filter()
[10:49:08] <Croves> Thank you, eddiemonge. I'll take a look at filter() =)
[10:49:11] <ZeroBeholder> winterpk: Yes, I cleaned up a script that had a ton of things happening at timed intervals-- those messed with the animations. The solution was to set one timer at sufficient intervals so that everything happened in the proper proportions and a count, if the count was a particular number do these things. If count is less than top number add one, else count is 0. That cleared up most of the...
[10:49:12] <Croves> didn't know about that function
[10:49:13] <ZeroBeholder> ...animation problems.
[10:49:47] <BillCriswell> Croves: $('div :radio').eq(0).prop('checked', true); might be all you need. Depending on how the radio buttons are laid out.
[10:50:33] <BillCriswell> $('div').each(function(){ $this.find(':radio').eq(0).prop('checked', true); }); I mean.... I think.
[10:50:37] <BillCriswell> Having a brain fart.
[10:50:40] <eddiemonge> winterpk: what browser?
[10:50:42] <Croves> BillCriswell: I think I'll have to loop each div, and do a search inside it to check what radio have the lower value
[10:50:57] <BillCriswell> Ah, ok.
[10:51:16] <Croves> But I'm not quite sure.. I'm a bit lost here
[10:51:23] <winterpk> eddie: im using FF
[10:52:44] <Croves> BillCriswell: Damn.. your code almost worked 100% :D But it's selecting only the first ones, I need to select the lower value one... but I think now I can do it
[10:52:57] <eddiemonge> winterpk: $('#footer-sitemap > div').children('div') is sort of funny
[10:53:09] <BillCriswell> Croves: .eq(-1) migh do the trick.
[10:54:27] <winterpk> eddie: yeah I know
[10:54:30] <eddiemonge> winterpk: also, why are you looking at the mouse position?
[10:54:30] <winterpk> still in dev
[10:54:56] <winterpk> because I need to know where on the image the mouse is so I can determine which image to swap out
[10:55:05] <Fuzai> Is there a way to make the acordian start completely collasped?
[10:55:15] <itatitat> guys I dont understand what happen in my code, I create an object, with some values by default, but later make click, those values are lost: http://jsfiddle.net/Wbp4d/
[10:55:57] <itatitat> someone can tell me?
[10:56:12] <winterpk> eddie: are you getting the jumpy anmiation?
[10:56:21] <eddiemonge> winterpk: a better way would be to have each image have its own element with background position and use hover to change the bg image with opacity
[10:56:37] <winterpk> yeah but then I can't keep it flowing like it is
[10:56:49] <winterpk> I tried that at first this way is better for my layout
[10:58:19] <Croves> BillCriswell: thank you!
[10:58:24] <Croves> It solved my problem
[10:58:25] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:59:05] <eddiemonge> winterpk: what do you mean you cant keep it flowing like it is? flowing how? you mean in order like that?
[10:59:34] <sorre> i'm using the http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/ and everything works smooth besides the fact that, each <li> appears in its natural position of the list and not in the position of the first <li>, Any ideas of what can be wrong?
[11:00:22] <winterpk> eddie: resize the window to small, I need that image to drop below on breakpoint.
[11:00:36] <winterpk> It doesn't work properly if I break it up into multiple images.
[11:01:18] <eddiemonge> itatitat: seems fine to me: http://jsfiddle.net/Wbp4d/1/
[11:01:28] <winterpk> that would mean I would have to set equal percentages with proper padding for each image and that doesn't work
[11:01:42] <itatitat> there must be a problem with closures or something, I lost the values of my object just after clicking the button
[11:01:56] <itatitat> but I dont know how to fix it...its my first time with objects
[11:02:34] <eddiemonge> winterpk: im just thinking that if you are seeing jumpy animations it could be all the mouse tracking
[11:03:09] <eddiemonge> you are running a function for every mousemove.
[11:03:20] <winterpk> yeah I see what you're saying
[11:03:22] <eddiemonge> itatitat: did you look at what i put?
[11:03:40] <itatitat> in jssfidle?
[11:03:55] <eddiemonge> yes
[11:03:59] <StephenS> hey guys, when I call ajax evertyhing is fine, however I want to place a ajax spinner to loading only when its requested, how would I do that
[11:04:01] <itatitat> im seeing
[11:04:08] <StephenS> how would I retrieve/know when loading is successful?
[11:05:01] <itatitat> eddiemonge: im seeing the same.....
[11:05:14] <sacho_> StephenS, how do you use ajax requests normally
[11:05:16] <itatitat> or perhaps I dont detect the difference...
[11:05:22] <BillCriswell> Croves: I aim so solve problems. Winston Wolfe is my idol.
[11:05:25] <StephenS> with $.ajax() and success: and error:
[11:05:37] <StephenS> depends is it event or on click tho
[11:05:49] <Croves> BillCriswell: lol
[11:05:56] <sacho_> so what's the problem of starting the spinner before you call that, then removing it on success/error?
[11:06:36] <StephenS> with ajaxComplete event is completed, but how to do it in meantime?
[11:07:03] <StephenS> I mean with ajaxComplete I can hide spinner, but during load, should i just add it inside success: ?
[11:07:14] <itatitat> eddiemonge: might you tell me what's the difference?
[11:07:58] <M4d3L-Rabbit> how do I transfort response from ajax into usable jquery object?
[11:08:05] <StephenS> json?
[11:08:10] <eddiemonge> M4d3L-Rabbit: automatically?
[11:08:34] <StephenS> sacho_, uhm ha?
[11:08:36] <M4d3L-Rabbit> I receive html in response, and I want to only get the <script></script> part
[11:08:41] <eddiemonge> .get(url, function(data) { data.someProp }, 'json');
[11:08:47] <StephenS> sacho_, do you mean placing spinner inside success: and then hididng it with ajaxComplete() ?
[11:08:57] <eddiemonge> M4d3L-Rabbit: then dont send both html and script
[11:09:07] <eddiemonge> otherwise you have to parse it and eval it
[11:09:53] <M4d3L-Rabbit> eddiemonge: yeah I know but this is the easyest way to do it actually. else to pass days to refactor it.
[11:09:59] <sacho_> stephens, I assume you want to show it before the success of the request
[11:10:06] <StephenS> Yeah
[11:10:12] <sacho_> so you'd do it near the ajax call.
[11:10:22] <StephenS> but then again is success the same as ajaxComplete()?
[11:10:43] <M4d3L-Rabbit> success: function (data) {  var script = $(data).find("script").html();} I have try something like this but return undefined.
[11:11:06] <sacho_> not quite
[11:12:29] <eddiemonge> itatitat: what are you trying to do? why do you think you need to do this as an object?
[11:12:53] <itatitat> I want to use objects.....is only that, I like to use them
[11:13:05] <itatitat> its a good opportunity to learn new stuff
[11:15:50] <ladislaw> I'd like to add a condition statement when a button is clicked outside of a particular element...
[11:16:36] <abes> question: I have a function $(document).on('click touchstart', function (e) - that detects when I click outside of a given div. How can I bind it to another function, so it only takes action when particular div is visible?
[11:24:29] <eddiemonge> ladislaw: abes it sounds like you two need something like outerclick
[11:27:07] <NoiseEee> ...function(e) { //is visible?  callOtherfunction();  }
[11:27:32] <BillCriswell> abes: You can look at the event's target and see what it is.
[11:27:33] <abes> eddiemonge: the idea is that I have an object that disappears onmouseleave, but now I have to make it also work on ipad, so I'm using .on('click touchstart"), but that is executed on the whole document - I don't want it wasting resources on each click throughout the site - id rather have it work only when the DIV to be hidden is visible. I hope Im making sense
[11:28:04] <eddiemonge> abes: set a flag then
[11:28:11] <eddiemonge> or bind and unbind
[11:28:20] <abes> eddiemonge: yes, i need to know how to bind it
[11:28:37] <abes> eddiemonge: that's exactly what I was suggested :)
[11:29:07] <BillCriswell> Anyone here use Balsamiq mockups?
[11:29:10] <eddiemonge> onclick(bind) || document.body.on(click, function(e) if e then unbind
[11:29:16] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: i do occasionally
[11:29:25] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I can't believe they don't have an iPad app.
[11:29:33] <eddiemonge> its flash. i can believe it
[11:29:55] <NoiseEee> abes: are you asking   if(somethingVisible) { document.on('click touchstart',etc); }  ?
[11:30:54] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Very true, but it would be so awesome on an iPad.
[11:32:35] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: it would be awesome not in flash too
[11:32:50] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: have you looked at imockup i think its called?
[11:33:05] <eddiemonge> http://www.endloop.ca/imockups/
[11:33:41] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I have not. Looks pretty good though.
[11:33:56] <BillCriswell> VERY similar to balsamiq or however you spell that.
[11:35:43] <eddiemonge> yeah
[11:36:29] <BillCriswell> there's no desktop version of this one which kind of stinks, woudl be nice to go back and forth.
[11:41:04] <winterpk> Has anyone ever experienced buggy animation when fading images ?  I'm trying to make an image replacement rollover, but during animation the images seem to be inconsistent widths. Once its finished its good, just during animation. Has anyone experienced this or have a fix for this?
[11:43:08] <sorre> i'm using the http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/ and everything works smooth besides the fact that, each <li> appears in its natural position of the list and not in the position of the first <li>, Any ideas of what can be wrong?
[11:44:43] <abes> Question: why would #aim-top disappear when I click ON it?
[11:45:05] <StephenS> hey guys <script>$("#langdiv").load("ajax/lang.php");</script>	is not actually loading as ajax
[11:45:22] <StephenS> I mean it displays lang, however I think its loaded on page load when that is modal
[11:55:57] <abes> Question: http://pastebin.com/cYqva6pm why would #aim-menu disappear when I click on #aim-top?
[11:56:25] <scar> so, if im using datepicker and i want to store the date MM/DD/YYYY , but also send the "actual day" such as "Sunday" via a callback, how is that possible?
[12:01:10] <tw2113> send it through some sort of date format function
[12:03:28] <whatever_42> hey guys. this is a stripped down version of my website. an ajax request is created via clicking on an element of #actualSidebar. the sidebar is updated via this ajax request as well and once this happened jquerys runs two ajax request at the same time. any ideas how to avoid this behavior?
[12:03:31] <whatever_42> http://jsfiddle.net/LpRAc/2/
[12:04:33] <whatever_42> i removed the ajax request of course in order to make it work on jsfiddle
[12:04:57] <Bubo> How do I get the position to where I have scrolled to on the website? http://puu.sh/2kvt4 As you can see I have scrolled down here, how do I get the TOP position on this window?

[12:17:55] <sayd> eddiemonge obviously
[12:18:16] <eddiemonge> im just curious what the reason is, other than fixing bugs or the like
[12:19:38] <sayd> eddiemonge yeah i was trying to see if it fixed this ember issue i am having
[12:20:05] <sayd> and since i already had it checked out it was easier to build then hunt down for the version
[12:21:27] <sayd> this bug specifically http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13292

[12:38:31] <StephenS> anyone?
[12:38:53] <pachet> StephenS: you're using inline event handlers, is what's wrong with it
[12:38:59] <pachet> why on earth, when you're already using jquery?
[12:39:08] <StephenS> how would you do it?
[12:39:11] <StephenS> with event?
[12:39:13] <StephenS> .click() ?
[12:39:43] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/x7YfH/
[12:40:19] <StephenS> ah k
[12:42:22] <StephenS> hmm why modal does not load then
[12:42:31] <StephenS> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/x7YfH/1/
[12:42:51] <StephenS> and modal div is inside /ajax/lang.php shouldnt that replace langdiv and make a popup modal?
[12:43:42] <StephenS> I just want on click to make a modal popup with loading txt or spinner and then to call ajax and displat all languages
[12:44:53] <StephenS> pachet, ?
[12:45:33] <eddiemonge> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/x7YfH/2/
[12:45:58] <eddiemonge> that doesnt give you a modal though. since you didnt specify what you are using for a modal
[12:48:00] <StephenS> yeh I have problem with modal
[12:48:28] <eddiemonge> StephenS: thats a separate issue then. what are you using?
[12:48:32] <NoiseEee> so maybe you should try making a fiddle that relates to the problem you're having.
[12:48:39] <pachet> $('#makethecall').makeModalPopup(loadingText || spinner).call(ajax).displat(allLanguages)

[12:54:03] <eddiemonge> StephenS: you know there is like a billion editors right? saying you want to use windows just because of notepad++ is like saying you want a specific car because of the steering wheel
[12:54:22] <eddiemonge> or some other analogy thats like something i was trying to compare
[12:54:23] <StephenS> Ive got used to npp

[13:02:11] <Quest> eddiemonge,  I imply if its just one line code to be adjusted in a method. payment does not seems implicit on such irc chat. does it?
[13:02:12] <m8> SpawnPro, thanks :)
[13:02:32] <vhsjon_> any help is much appreciated!
[13:04:01] <eddiemonge> Quest: i mean if you havent learned the basics on what you are doing and asking for others to fix all your code for you without you understanding it isnt a longterm viable solution
[13:04:28] <Quest> eddiemonge,  ok
[13:04:46] <Quest> i just needed that to work in my life. any way thanks
[13:06:26] <whatever_42> ok try #2. hey guys. this is a stripped down version of my website. an ajax request is created via clicking on an element of #actualSidebar. the sidebar is updated via this ajax request as well and once this happened jquerys runs two ajax request at the same time. any ideas how to avoid this behavior?
[13:06:34] <whatever_42> http://jsfiddle.net/LpRAc/2/
[13:07:04] <pachet> eddiemonge: geez, he just needed it to work
[13:07:06] <pachet> in his life
[13:07:14] <eddiemonge> :(
[13:09:19] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: those are some crazy selectors
[13:10:39] <whatever_42> i prefer to think of them as creative :D ok maybe not the best solution. i wrote it when it discovered that jquery also uses these selectors. but i do not think that they cause this problem do they?
[13:12:19] <eddiemonge> no but it makes it harder to figure out what you are targeting
[13:13:41] <whatever_42> ok a more simple version http://jsfiddle.net/LpRAc/4/
[13:14:34] <benjibee> If I have a form I'm serializing and passing to .load() is it better to pass as an array or serialized string? Or is it the same?
[13:14:56] <eddiemonge> same
[13:16:16] <benjibee> eddiemonge: Okay, thanks.
[13:16:43] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: http://jsfiddle.net/LpRAc/5/ but whats your question again?
[13:16:54] <danheberden> benjibee: also depends on how you want it consumed by your serverside stuff
[13:17:21] <whatever_42> well those sidebar elements can be replaced via ajax
[13:17:50] <whatever_42> but ones they are replaced and i click on a "new" one jquery runs two ajax request instead of just one.
[13:18:56] <benjibee> danheberden: passing url parameters to the page itself, targetting a specific DIV, and the PHP grabs the _GET or _POST data and updates content inside of that DIV.
[13:19:07] <whatever_42> and three in case the sidebar is replaced once more so every time i replace those it increases by one
[13:19:29] <SpawnPro> that will help you m8
[13:19:31] <SpawnPro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9amsg2rF5f0
[13:19:37] <m8> :O
[13:19:38] <danheberden> benjibee: i wasn't being clear with my question, but sounds like you have it all worked out
[13:20:45] <benjibee> danheberden: Well, I'm having some issues at the moment, but I wanted to doublecheck I'm going about it the recommended way before I tear my code apart looking for the bug.
[13:21:35] <itatitat> guys, it's happening something weird with an ajax request. Im calling, with get, to a page in another server that only has ->    echo "hello!!!";    but I dont receive that hello never
[13:21:47] <itatitat> its very simple. But instedad, if I use curl, or I write the address in the browser, I see that "hello!!"
[13:23:40] <itatitat> my code is absolutely simple, its this one:  http://jsfiddle.net/wctqf/1/
[13:24:06] <NoiseEee> itatitat: haven't we been over this?
[13:24:07] <whatever_42> query is not enabled.
[13:24:12] <NoiseEee> itatitat: same origin policy for javascript?
[13:24:17] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: when are you calling that function?
[13:24:23] <itatitat> policy for javascript?..............
[13:24:38] <NoiseEee> itatitat: unless your JS/app is running on "http://domain.com/" you cannot ajax/xhr there (*)
[13:24:52] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript @ itatitat
[13:24:57] <NoiseEee> itatitat: same link as from 3 hours ago
[13:24:58] <itatitat> yes, its running, if I write the address I can see that "hello!"
[13:25:04] <whatever_42> eddiemonge: which one do you mean?
[13:25:05] <NoiseEee> .... good luck.
[13:25:06] <eddiemonge> itatitat: whats console say for the response?
[13:25:27] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: the event binder. it sounds like its called everytime you load the ajax instead of once
[13:25:35] <itatitat> readyState=1, statusText="error"
[13:25:50] <eddiemonge> and whats the error?
[13:26:19] <NoiseEee> s.o.p. i'll bet, $100 double down
[13:26:20] <itatitat> the error is that I dont see the response from the server, never, but the server is working, is a simple echo
[13:26:35] <whatever_42> well i want this function to be called every time i click on an .sidebar-element
[13:26:43] <NoiseEee> itatitat: what does your browser console show about the XHR response?
[13:27:21] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: not the event, i mean the actual saying when this is clicked do this
[13:27:30] <itatitat> the last time was "error:"
[13:27:32] <itatitat> only that
[13:27:50] <eddiemonge> itatitat: where do you see that?
[13:27:57] <eddiemonge> what browser?
[13:27:58] <itatitat> firebug, in console
[13:28:23] <itatitat> I added a statement error: in the ajax request
[13:28:33] <whatever_42> i am afraid i can't follow you.
[13:29:10] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: what is your actual code?

[13:32:11] <constantin_mike> hello again
[13:32:24] <constantin_mike> one more question about bootstrap modal: how do i specify the window size?
[13:32:31] <constantin_mike> btw, the docs are really baaaad
[13:32:42] <constantin_mike> so, any ideas?
[13:34:07] <eddiemonge> itatitat: look in chrome since i forgot how firebug works: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s18/sh/489ae932-f48b-4a48-94b2-1a6fa5e6a18a/801f1b91c6ebdc9f19e2f6c054d2d96a
[13:34:23] <itatitat> thanks
[13:39:36] <lejocelyn> Hi, I'm looking at different soap plugins to do some autocomplete from soap services
[13:39:43] <kid_icarus> why would jQuery('#whatever').append() work, and jQuery.find('#whatever').append() error with undefined method?
[13:39:44] <lejocelyn> I found that : https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap/blob/master/README.md
[13:39:52] <lejocelyn> what do you think ?
[13:40:46] <whatever_42> so? or are you now stunned because of the bad code?
[13:42:39] <Nancy2012> I m using jquery UI datepicket n want to make a calendar somethign like this (http://www.vueling.com/en/) and my problem is only to disabled all dates previous of from"
[13:42:52] <tw2113> alrighty, for once i have a question
[13:43:17] <tw2113> how do I re-bind some on() calls after submitting some content via ajax
[13:43:25] <Nancy2012> any idea guysâ€¦
[13:44:12] <NoiseEee> tw2113: you don't, you use event delegation.  $('#commonParentOfNewContent').on('click','.classOfStuffCaredAbout',function(){});
[13:44:17] <Nancy2012> i have 2 dates. from and to  and once user inserts from dateâ€¦ then user can not select date which are previus than from
[13:44:22] <constantin_mike> any idea on bootstrap modal size setting?!
[13:44:31] <Nancy2012> i m using jquery datepicker
[13:44:36] <Nancy2012> any idea guys???
[13:45:35] <benjibee> Why would two key value URL parameters passed by jQuery via .serialize() and .load() only show one (omitting the second completley) when I print_r($_POST) on that page?
[13:45:47] <tw2113> NoiseEee, so that i am comprehending. attach on() to something that doesn't change/reload with the ajax, and just have it search the reloaded content?
[13:46:11] <tw2113> essentially
[13:46:16] <vacho> can someone guide me in the right direction? I want the input on row 25 to be the result of an ajax call that returns an object. http://pastebin.com/vCF5Cmdt
[13:47:18] <NoiseEee> tw2113: you attach the .on() to a common parent of the dynamic/non-dynamic stuff that does the same thing, and then use the 2nd parameter to restrict it to a selector of your choice (ie: '.classToDoStuffWith')
[13:47:27] <DansVC> hello
[13:47:28] <tw2113> gotcha
[13:47:30] <eddiemonge> Nancy2012: did you look at http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range
[13:47:56] <DansVC> Someone help me?
[13:48:10] <eddiemonge> benjibee: are they the same name?
[13:48:21] <Nancy2012> thanks
[13:48:44] <DansVC> How I can play the two codes? http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/fbFuW/145/
[13:49:13] <tw2113> thanks NoiseEee
[13:49:24] <benjibee> eddiemonge: the key and value pairs? Yes, the two keys are, but not the values.. is this an issue?
[13:49:25] <vacho> anyone/
[13:50:11] <DansVC> no, I have the key control and click to move the ball
[13:50:18] <benjibee> real example: attachment_id=4873&language=english&attachment_id=4872&language=german
[13:51:23] <whatever_42> eddiemonge?
[13:51:32] <tomasm-> hi, I'm getting an issue with some code that heavily relies upon "curCSS".... I was wondering what to use instead of $["curCSS"] ... also, does that syntax basically mean $.curCSS ? (ie hash key notation instead of dot-notation) - and what do I replace it with?
[13:52:09] <sacho_> yes to your syntax question
[13:52:49] <vacho>  tw2113: care to take a look? http://pastebin.com/vCF5Cmdt
[13:52:49] <sacho_> I hadn't heard of curcss but reading the 1.8 release notes, it was just an alias for css
[13:52:57] <sacho_> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[13:53:03] <eddiemonge> benjibee: you need to pass them as an array
[13:53:18] <eddiemonge> attachment_id[]=4873&language=english&attachment_id[]=4872&language=german
[13:53:49] <tw2113> no idea vacho
[13:53:57] <vacho> ok
[13:54:27] <tw2113> NoiseEee is my hero of the day
[13:54:39] <benjibee> eddiemonge: well I'm actually using .serializeArray() and .load(url+targetDiv, serializedArray)
[13:54:57] <eddiemonge> whatever_42: i dont know why there would be multiple ajax calls. i feel like it would be something else
[13:55:48] <eddiemonge> benjibee: whats the form look like?
[13:56:11] <whatever_42> ok well thanks anyway
[13:58:26] <rrva> What could be the reason if a site with jquery works in all browsers, except ipad where it gets "Can't find variable: $"
[13:58:49] <benjibee> eddiemonge: <form><input hidden name="attachement_id" value="0000"> <select name="language"> <option value="english"> <input type="submit"> </form>
[13:59:10] <eddiemonge> why would you have multiples then?
[13:59:29] <eddiemonge> rrva: have you tried linting your code? is jquery even loading?
[14:00:23] <rrva> eddiemonge: its loading fine in all browsers, no errors except on ipad for some users
[14:00:36] <benjibee> The contents of the <form> can be repeated x times by a foreach in the PHP before </form>
[14:01:27] <benjibee> The weird thing is that a console.log() of the .serialize() string shows exactly what I want.. all of the variables in order and one after another.
[14:01:56] <benjibee> And .serializeArray() shows all of the objects as I'd want, too.
[14:06:09] <vhsjon_> hi guys, there is  a lot of different ways of scrolling and zooming for query mobile, does anybody have any good experiences with any of them? For me it looks like iscroll4 should be a good choice.
[14:06:23] <benjibee> Erp... this is weird.
[14:06:40] <shoky> benjibee: .load() issues a GET request.. check the request URL/params
[14:07:05] <xboi209> how do i check if an element's children does not have a certain element?
[14:07:37] <benjibee> shoky: I'm passing data through .load() as an object which should be POST according to the docs, no?
[14:07:39] <shoky> .has
[14:08:23] <shoky> benjibee:  ah right, sorry.
[14:10:47] <lejocelyn> for that plugin, https://github.com/doedje/jquery.soap, there a soap.jquery.json file; I'm not sure what it is for
[14:10:50] <lejocelyn> any idea?
[14:14:00] <shoky> benjibee: well, indeed its sent with the multiple values.. it's a PHP question of how to parse it correctly
[14:14:56] <benjibee> shoky: I think you're right, I just wanted to clear jQuery before I dug into the rest of my code. Thanks, though.
[14:17:40] <shoky> benjibee: maybe it'd help if you add [] to the end of the key name.. i'm not sure tho
[14:21:02] <boytoy> Anybody know how to add custom CSS3 transitions to SwipeJS? http://jsbin.com/imotil/4/edit

[14:22:01] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[14:22:11] <masentinel900> Why always takes the same url?
[14:23:29] <shoky> masentinel900: you're always referencing the same element
[14:24:17] <masentinel900> I'm just taking the class of that element, but me condition serialize the id of element
[14:24:17] <shoky> .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the __first__ element in the set of matched elements
[14:24:28] <shoky> the id of the FIRST element
[14:24:29] <masentinel900> haha...
[14:24:40] <masentinel900> So, How could I to do that?
[14:24:52] <shoky> do what?
[14:25:24] <liam> hey does anyone know if the countdown widget on this page is opensource or can be bought from somewhere? http://www.talenthouse.com/create-artwork-for-olympus-has-fallen
[14:25:42] <shoky> if you want to loop over elements you can use .each ..
[14:26:16] <metatron1> How can I bind .on() to more than 1 object?
[14:26:30] <masentinel900> I need conditioned the url about what <a> selected
[14:26:57] <billycomic> .swipe-wrap > div {
[14:26:59] <metatron1> IE, var foo = "#foo", bar = "#bar"; $($(foo), $(bar)).on(...

[14:32:05] <troop> hello, i created a city town  select script with php. when someone select a city then town selectbox will come automaticaly with towns depends on city selection. it works good. but after the came of town selectbox i can't see <option> s on source?
[14:32:11] <troop> is it normal?
[14:33:07] <masentinel900> <shoky>: How do you believe hat could to be that my script?
[14:33:33] <shoky> masentinel900: it's hard to understand you.. maybe you want a click handler for the <a>s  and use this.id  inside
[14:34:15] <masentinel900> See, I just want get the id for to do like a switch what should to open
[14:34:18] <masentinel900> for example
[14:34:27] <shoky> based on which <a> was clicked?
[14:34:29] <masentinel900> If the id = "1" open window 1
[14:34:38] <masentinel900> If the id = "2" open window 2
[14:34:42] <masentinel900> Like this
[14:34:43] <shoky> based on which <a> was clicked?
[14:34:54] <masentinel900> <li><a class='left-menu-a' id='sorPro' data-fancybox-type='ajax'>Orden Procesos</a></li>
[14:34:58] <shoky> if id="1"  was clicked,  open window 1   <-- yes?
[14:35:07] <masentinel900> yes
[14:35:16] <shoky> then you need a .on('click',...   handler
[14:35:22] <shoky> to handle clicks.
[14:36:00] <masentinel900> Hey, But is another way .... see
[14:36:11] <troop> i think i found a serious bug
[14:36:22] <sacho_> well, that's serious.
[14:36:25] <masentinel900> I have a list of four tags <a>
[14:36:32] <shoky> e.g.  $(document).on('click', '.left-menu-a', function(e) {  var url;  if (this.id === 'sorPro') { url = 'bla' } ....etc }
[14:36:53] <masentinel900> mmmm..
[14:36:57] <shoky> best to switch document to some other element that contains the <a>'s
[14:36:59] <masentinel900> I going to try it!
[14:38:03] <shoky> you can also just write the urls as a data-url (or data-whatever) tag
[14:38:25] <shoky> and then you dont need the 'if/else' stuff
[14:38:35] <shoky> just.. $(this).data('url')  is the url (inside the click handler)
[14:38:55] <shoky> i meant a data-url attribute , sry
[14:39:28] <shoky> <a class="left-menu-a" data-url="/theUrl/forThis/link" ...
[14:39:52] <shoky> i'd also guess fancybox already has a way for you to do that
[14:41:24] <clone1018> Does anyone know of a jQuery plugin that'll allow me to easily allow the user to rotate images? Kinda like jQuery UI's resize/movable
[14:42:22] <troop> there is a really bug, i will try to explain... http://pastebin.com/Xc9pkGWD here is the file please read
[14:44:14] <rael> jsfiddle doesn't work in ie8?
[14:52:28] <troop> ???
[14:59:41] <whatever_42> ok still the same problem. http://jsfiddle.net/LpRAc/5/ this is a stripped down version of my code. by clicking on an list element query fires an ajax request. this request might update the sidebar. once the sidebar is changed query fires 2 requests at once. any ideas?
[14:59:59] <shoky> troop: if you think there's a bug, reproduce it on http://jsfiddle.net   you can also mock ajax requests there if you need
[15:01:33] <troop> shoky: i use codeigniter, does jsfiddle run codeigniter kind programming?
[15:03:41] <gf3> troop: Does jsfiddle run PHP?
[15:03:41] <shoky> troop:  codeigniter is server-side. i thought you "found a bug" in jquery/client-side
[15:03:53] <shoky> troop: if the bug is in codeigniter, then dont ask about it here.
[15:04:17] <shoky> if you just have an issue and want help, please ask
[15:04:26] <troop> shoky if i find to source of bug i may be fix, i ask here and there
[15:04:38] <troop> i already ask?
[15:05:16] <shoky> troop:  cant help you if i dont see the issue myself.. looking at your pastebin doesnt help
[15:05:29] <troop> by the way, i upload my local files to server.. it works there, i think its local server bug?
[15:05:36] <shoky> how should i know?
[15:06:30] <troop> ok thanks i'm trying to fix
[15:06:46] <shoky> all you said is "there is a bug, after this i can't post the data or bring data"
[15:08:06] <troop> http://yigitozmen.com/CI/index.php/ilce shoky  does it work? please try
[15:08:39] <shoky> troop... <script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost/CI/js/jquery.js"></script>
[15:08:58] <shoky> i hope you know what localhost means
[15:10:01] <troop> i know shoky please don't despise me. i just sent my file to web server from localhost and i had forgot to change
[15:10:41] <shoky> i definitely don't despise you
[15:10:51] <shoky> i'm allowed to tease though
[15:11:00] <shoky> how you take it is up to you
[15:11:55] <shoky> btw you're missing a <body>
[15:12:07] <troop> http://yigitozmen.com/CI/index.php/ilce now try please
[15:12:15] * tw2113 is too sexy for this <body>
[15:13:11] <shoky> troop:  your PHP is throwing errors
[15:13:39] <shoky> troop:  http://pastebin.com/ev2xHSZ6
[15:13:42] <troop> what is message?
[15:14:01] <shoky> that's what the ajax response is
[15:14:30] <shoky> and you're setting the <select>'s inner html to that...
[15:14:40] <troop> interesting, it works here right now, but throws error you
[15:15:15] <shoky> it "works" here too, as in, the 2nd <select> does get changed
[15:15:17] <shoky> but...
[15:15:32] <troop> but there is no error here?
[15:15:42] <shoky> there is error.
[15:16:02] <troop> i think i'm discovered php with AI
[15:16:05] <shoky> /ilce/ajax is outputting that error
[15:16:05] <b-ot> shoky: memorised â€œilce/ajaxâ€.
[15:17:02] <troop> i will ask the error in #php
[15:18:50] <shoky> troop: it seems pretty simple.. you didn't define the variable
[15:18:56] <liox_> after creating a dynamic content I can not read the size in lenght
[15:19:58] <liox_> someone help me
[15:19:58] <liox_> ?
[15:20:12] <shoky> `demo @ liox_
[15:20:12] <b-ot> liox_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:20:49] <troop> shoky http://yigitozmen.com/CI/index.php/ilce can you try again please?
[15:21:16] <shoky> troop:  still same error
[15:21:23] <shoky> troop:  you didn't define $object anywhere.. i think
[15:21:40] <troop> i defined now
[15:21:59] <troop> interesting, it works here and someone's computer too :S
[15:22:17] <shoky> what does "works" mean
[15:22:24] <shoky> it changes the <select> here too..
[15:22:47] <shoky> but it does so while throwing the error (if i look at the network tab to see what the server responds with)
[15:23:25] <troop> haaa in firebug
[15:23:31] <troop> now i understand you
[15:23:31] <shoky> no shit
[15:23:38] <sheilablackrose> hi guys, i have this in my view <span id="tagButtonSave" class="btn-green solid panelSubmitBtnText">Apply</span> and $(document.body).on('click','#tagButtonSave', savePanelTags); in my js file. it works fine on a pc but doens't on a ipad. any idea why
[15:23:39] <sheilablackrose> ?
[15:23:54] <troop> i can't see any error message in browser... but now i look in firebug and i see
[15:25:27] <luckyruby> what's the preferred way nowadays to prevent multiple form submissions using jquery?
[15:25:35] <luckyruby> .one?
[15:25:47] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  i think it's because on ipad the click/touch events don't bubble up to <body>
[15:26:03] <sheilablackrose> so what can i do to fix it?
[15:26:14] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  instead of document.body  use a container element that is "closer" to the clicked elements
[15:26:17] <sheilablackrose> change event works right?
[15:27:04] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  change document.body to some container <div> or whatever you have in your html under <body> ..
[15:27:11] <shoky> donno what change event has to do with it
[15:27:14] <sheilablackrose> shoky can you explain please. do you mean like a div than call $('#div').click
[15:27:17] <sheilablackrose> ah ic
[15:28:29] <sheilablackrose> bcoz i have a similar one like $(document.body).on('change', '.cashflowMainCheckBox', getCurrentCashFlowTag);
[15:28:34] <sheilablackrose> this seems to work on an ipad
[15:28:48] <shoky> yeah its specific to click events i think
[15:29:24] <sheilablackrose> got it ill try using a div or a span
[15:29:26] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[15:48:50] <sheilablackrose> shoky you were right
[15:49:50] <shoky> i'll have some pizza then
[15:51:09] <sheilablackrose> :)
[15:52:25] <Shoutsid> This seems really hack-ish? All I'm doing is wraping the image size to the container... https://gist.github.com/shoutsid/5200887

[16:25:59] <track7> Any freelance javascript developers here looking for a paid opportunity?
[16:27:34] <coldhead> track7: you might want to summarise the project somewhere online and link people to that so they have some idea what's on offer
[16:30:16] <Woosta> $('#summary').load( document.location.href + ' #summary')
[16:30:24] <Woosta> ^^ loads the summary into itself
[16:30:34] <Woosta> How should I *replace* the summary with itself?
[16:30:49] <coldhead> ?replacewith
[16:30:50] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[16:31:26] <Woosta> OK, so it can't quite be as neat :-D
[16:31:32] <Woosta> Thanks for replaceWith
[16:33:55] <Woosta> So if I $.get() the page, what do I pass to replaceWith to just get #summary ?
[16:34:21] <Woosta> Does something like this work? $(data).find('#summary')
[16:34:34] <Woosta> (where data is from .get)
[16:35:09] <coldhead> yes, that's what i'd shoot for
[16:35:24] <coldhead> $('#summary').replaceWith( $(data).find('#summary') )
[16:35:36] <Woosta> Worked 100%!
[16:35:37] <Woosta> THanks
[16:35:47] <coldhead> and if that worked i'd poor myself a generous whiskey
[16:36:18] <Woosta> I'd pour YOU one if you were here
[16:36:46] <coldhead> it's 10:30am here, so i guess that would be okay

[17:11:08] <rhickeybot> grafi: yeah the problem is that query ajax will turn them into +
[17:11:26] <rhickeybot> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3400
[17:11:46] <grafi> so encode it yourself?
[17:16:42] <innociv> What is the best way to read data from a png?  I need to get the RGB of each pixel.
[17:22:23] <gf3> innociv: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Pixel_manipulation_with_canvas
[17:23:42] <verism_> maybe i should rephrase : is there a way to reliably tell what an element's dimensions are, before invoking a function?
[17:23:51] <imsky> yes/no
[17:24:03] <imsky> the element must be at least "invisible"
[17:24:26] <imsky> if it hasn't been created yet or its display is set to none or it's in a parent with display none, it's not going to be easy
[17:24:38] <verism_> it's always visible
[17:24:48] <imsky> have you tried .width and .height
[17:25:14] <verism_> i used .outerHeight(), as it includes floated children
[17:25:41] <imsky> yep that's better
[17:26:17] <innociv> Do I really need to use canvas when all I want to do is read the array of pixels?
[17:26:48] <imsky> yeah dude
[17:26:50] <imsky> welcome to hell
[17:26:58] <imsky> it's not a 2-dimensional array either
[17:27:02] <verism_> can you see the link i posted? - that's the code i'm using
[17:28:02] <innociv> heh
[17:28:17] <verism_> i considered delay() to offset any render time - but it seems hacky
[17:28:17] <innociv> I'm having trouble reading that page.  I don't see where to get imageData from
[17:28:36] <greengriminal> Is it possible to make the selectable work with jquery-ui dialog? Using the following example - http://jqueryui.com/selectable/#display-grid is it possible to select and then have a dialog appear?
[17:30:00] <innociv> imsky, not being 2d array is fine.  You just calculate based off the width.
[17:30:15] <imsky> yeah, don't get too smart
[17:30:21] <innociv> ?
[17:38:06] <innociv> So um, how do I actually create a canvas element and load a png into it?
[17:38:24] <innociv> I'm not seeing this.  I'm seeing how to create ones from scratch and such when I want to read from a web image.
[17:42:41] <abes> Question: how would I go about detecting a click/touch outside of a SET of elements instead of a single element?
[17:47:26] <verism_> somebody *must* know something about js runtime vs. DOM element sizing
[17:47:44] <verism_> @abes - how are you defining the set of elements
[17:50:08] <greengriminal> is there a reason why my .selectable() is not working with my dialog. - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5201471
[17:57:14] <initself> using jQuery tabs, my url doesn't change when #anchor tags are used.
[17:57:23] <initself> is there a way to actually change the displayed url?
[17:59:51] <viktorminator> hi all! I have toogle question also. I've made two div-block which I want to show depending on my group button clicks. Here is what was done http://jsfiddle.net/fwMLt/395/ My question is: how to select my data-show div? I can get attribute data-show and after that how to make selection of this data-show div?
[18:04:44] <shoky> viktorminator:  $('#' + $(this).data('show'))
[18:05:26] <viktorminator> shoky, thanks! that's just what I need to know!
[18:15:31] <zuloyd> hi
[18:18:25] <topriddy> hi guys...i need an action button such that when clicked shows pops up a list of menu that could be different actions with icons just to the right of it. not sure exactly how to proceed
[18:18:48] <Teza19> Hi, I'm looking at finding a jQuery RSS ticket, but can only seem to find ones that allow a single source of feeds. Is there a way to either a) consolidate the information from multiple feeds into one, or b) find a jquery example with multiple feeds?
[18:19:44] <coldhead> Teza19: i've never had much luck reading remote RSS with jquery. i'd lean on yahoo pipes for that kind of thing, to consolidate and what not
[18:19:56] <greengriminal> I have seletable() working however it seems to not be highlighting nor firing the dialog - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5201594 any ideas?
[18:20:10] <topriddy> how does one go about stuff like that?
[18:20:14] <Teza19> coldhead: so you suggest adding the feeds to something like yahoo/google and then pulling info from them?
[18:20:34] <coldhead> yes, i've done that before
[18:20:38] <coldhead> it made things simpler
[18:21:04] <coldhead> that's just me though, Teza19, there might be other ways
[18:21:34] <Teza19> okay, I'll try that. How would you recommend I pull the information from yahoo. Do they have sample code that you can just 'add' to your website? Sorry, I've never implemented RSS into a site before.
[18:22:08] <[Tyrant]> Whats the dead simplest way to slide in a body background image on page load, just once.
[18:22:13] <coldhead> Teza19: give it a google, i did it a few years ago and there were a lot of tutorials
[18:22:15] <coldhead> it was very easy
[18:22:25] <Teza19> Great. Thanks coldhead.
[18:22:27] <coldhead> unfortunately the code i used has been retired so i can't link you :(
[18:22:39] <Teza19> That's fine :) thanks anyway.
[18:22:43] <coldhead> dytrivedi works for yahoo if you need any help :D
[18:22:50] <coldhead> he's online in a couple of hours
[18:29:25] <initself> how do i get a selector to match id="add_list_attempt_button.0" ?
[18:29:35] <initself> don't care about the 0
[18:29:51] <initself> want the code to run if a user clicks with an id that matches 'add_list_attempt_button'
[18:29:56] <initself> just use pattern matching?
[18:34:22] <basiclaser> hey guys what is the syntax for creating a variable from user input?  turning the input range value into the var time for example? I tried var time = $('input value') but it didn't seem to work
[18:34:25] <shoky> initself:  http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[18:34:58] <basiclaser> i am a noob, i always forget the correct syntax
[18:35:09] <initself> i did this but it didn't feel good
[18:35:09] <initself> $("[id^=add_list_attempt_button]").click(function () {
[18:35:25] <shoky> oh you want wildcard
[18:35:35] <shoky> yea that's how you do it and you're right, it's not good
[18:35:53] <initself> can you say more about what's not good?
[18:35:58] <shoky> use classes instead, and if you got time read about event delegation
[18:36:24] <initself> makes sense
[18:37:20] <StephenS> I have response on success and its always true, how come?
[18:37:30] <initself> wait, but if there are other classes that match this....
[18:37:35] <tw2113> because your magic 8 ball is busted
[18:37:41] <initself> it's select them all, i just want it to select THE ONE
[18:38:03] <imsky> tw2113, faulty logic
[18:38:08] <imsky> could be 2000 trues in a row
[18:38:11] <StephenS> and ajax is not even called
[18:38:13] <imsky> and the 2001st response is false
[18:39:15] <shoky> initself:  what is THE ONE
[18:39:28] <initself> shoky: ya, i'm beginning to see that i havent' clearly defined things
[18:39:43] <initself> there's a number of button on the screen
[18:39:51] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[18:39:53] <initself> ok
[18:42:25] <verism_> @shoky - have you any ideas how i can be sure of an element's height before invoking a function?
[18:42:37] <verism_> you seem to be well versed
[18:42:43] <shoky> initself: and btw since you asked whats not good, just know that if you do $('[id^=smth]')  it's the same as:  $('*[id^=smth]')  meaning it selects all elements and does filtering
[18:43:25] <prologic> Hey all. I have some fairly complex UI requirements (GIS Web App) and I would like to use a richer UI/Widget library than what JQuery UI provides.
[18:43:35] <initself> shoky:
[18:43:36] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/Ugnva/
[18:43:40] <prologic> For me it's a choice between jqwidgets, kendo and wijimo
[18:43:46] <shoky> verism_: usually you just get its height and it'll be its height at the time you got it. assuming its in the DOM and visible and all. i read some of your question earlier, and the missing ingredient was a jsfiddle/demo
[18:44:01] <prologic> But having trouble deciding -- several of my colleagues don't like jqwidgets because they think it looks uglyâ€¦
[18:44:39] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/Ugnva/1/
[18:44:43] <initself> shoky: seems to work ok
[18:45:02] <verism_> fair enough - it's difficult to recreate in jsf - i'll try again
[18:45:18] <[Tyrant]> Whats the most dead simple way to slide in a body background-image on page load, just once.
[18:45:26] <shoky> initself:  ok so:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Ugnva/2/
[18:45:38] <shoky> initself:  still don't know what THE ONE is
[18:45:52] <initself> shoky: yes, that's fine, i totally understand what you are saying
[18:45:57] <initself> .click will get the one clicked
[18:46:01] <StephenS> what to do?
[18:46:09] <initself> the selector just chooses which ones will be processed on click
[18:46:12] <StephenS> I have response but cannot redirect with php header
[18:46:25] <shoky> StephenS: it's impossible so far to understand your problem
[18:46:35] <shoky> StephenS: we can't read your mind
[18:47:07] <StephenS> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/LHZMX/
[18:48:01] <StephenS> here what I tried http://jsfiddle.net/LHZMX/1/
[18:48:03] <shoky> StephenS: what's the problem ?
[18:48:27] <StephenS> the fact is, response and error is showing fine, and when its done (user registered) header work, but just inside the div showerror
[18:48:30] <initself> shoky++
[18:48:47] <StephenS> I need on response "done" to redirect client fully, and not inside div.
[18:49:13] <StephenS> anyway if I compare response === done, its always true, even if I didnt called ajax, its in src, always true.
[18:49:39] <shoky> StephenS: location.href = '/new/url';
[18:49:53] <StephenS> no
[18:49:55] <StephenS> it wont work
[18:50:02] <StephenS> maybe inside php file
[18:50:10] <StephenS> but it wont work with response comparation
[18:51:03] <shoky> why wouldn't it be === done ?
[18:51:23] <StephenS> because when I insert info in db, I echo done as response
[18:52:03] <shoky> so ..?
[18:52:37] <shoky> also no idea what you meant with:   even if I didnt called ajax, its in src, always true.
[18:53:06] <StephenS> uhm, well forget about that sentence
[18:53:14] <StephenS> Your way work, but not really well
[18:53:14] <shoky> which sentences should i remember, then?
[18:53:38] <StephenS> on submission, diverror is still showed for a second, until location is redirected to the page
[18:53:50] <StephenS> but there must be better way
[18:54:09] <StephenS> for example how would I display success div if response is good?
[18:54:16] <shoky> huh?
[18:54:26] <shoky> you want to redirect, or you wanna show a success div..?
[18:54:36] <shoky> what diverror?
[18:55:20] <StephenS> shoky, depends on what user did, if user have errors in submission sign up form, then error div, if registration is good, then successfib
[18:55:22] <StephenS> div*
[18:55:47] <shoky> if you dont want error div to show, don't show it
[18:55:50] <shoky> it can't be simpler than that
[18:55:54] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, why don't you just hide the div immediately if you get a success returned
[18:56:08] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, then do your redirect
[18:56:20] <StephenS> LocalPCGuy, and how to hide it on success?
[18:56:30] <StephenS> You mean to put jquery script in php ajax code?
[18:56:58] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, ajax has a callback function, .done() and .fail()
[18:57:06] <LocalPCGuy> ?done @ StephenS
[18:57:06] <bot-t> StephenS, deferred.done(doneCallbacks, [doneCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[18:57:45] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, and in that callback function you can check your condition to make sure your insert was successful, and if so, hide the error div with jquery
[18:58:47] <StephenS> that done fun works with $.get
[18:58:58] <StephenS> I dont get anything, I submit values with json format
[18:59:43] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, it doesn't matter what you submit, you can still return a result.  what specific ajax function are you using?
[19:00:03] <shoky> $.ajax
[19:00:36] <shoky> i didn't understand his problem yet :S
[19:00:38] <LocalPCGuy> I think it actually doesn't matter, I think all the ajax functions will fire a done() callback
[19:00:47] <StephenS> that I think too
[19:00:49] <LocalPCGuy> but .ajax definitely does
[19:00:54] <shoky> yea they all do
[19:00:55] <StephenS> I dont get it
[19:01:12] <shoky> StephenS: what's the problem again..
[19:01:45] <StephenS> div showingon successful sign up submission
[19:01:49] <shoky> imagine we're stupid and you have to explain, step by step.
[19:02:01] <StephenS> I click sign up button and I get redirected
[19:02:13] <shoky> no, we're stupider than that
[19:02:14] <StephenS> but for second I see displayed errordiv
[19:02:20] <shoky> talk slower. dont swallow your words
[19:02:35] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, ya, I understand your problem, and I gave you a solution
[19:02:50] <StephenS> but how to know when its .done ?
[19:03:06] <LocalPCGuy> with a callback function passed to .done
[19:03:15] <LocalPCGuy> go read the API docs for done
[19:03:21] <LocalPCGuy> it accepts a callback function
[19:03:45] <LocalPCGuy> $.ajax({ ...ajaxstuff... }).done(callbackFunction);
[19:03:46] <shoky> he's already using 'success' option which is equivalent
[19:03:58] <LocalPCGuy> well, then I really don't understand the "problem"
[19:04:02] <shoky> ;]
[19:04:38] <shoky> StephenS, see? we're really really stupid
[19:04:39] <LocalPCGuy> if you know when the AJAX function returns, via done or success, then you can hide the errordiv
[19:04:58] <StephenS> maybe see LocalPCGuy http://jsfiddle.net/LHZMX/1/
[19:05:18] <LocalPCGuy> ok, first line problem - .live()
[19:05:20] <LocalPCGuy> ;P
[19:05:27] <LocalPCGuy> shouldn't use that
[19:05:34] <StephenS> but on main signup.html page I have $("#showerror").html(response).show;
[19:05:34] <shoky> StephenS:  why is the errordiv showing for a second? when are you showing it?
[19:05:39] <StephenS> so wahetevr response is, errordiv is always showed
[19:05:58] <shoky> StephenS:  maybe your PHP is not really returning "done"  ?
[19:06:02] <StephenS> I tried with if(response === "goodform") { #divsuccess }
[19:06:05] <StephenS> but somehow that wont work
[19:06:09] <shoky> maybe there's a newline before the "done" , for example
[19:06:10] <StephenS> It is returning
[19:06:12] <shoky> or any other thing
[19:06:26] <StephenS> Its returning but the problem is with javascript
[19:06:35] <shoky> StephenS:  console.log(response)  first thing in the success function
[19:06:39] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, have you looked at your response in the chrome dev tools network tab or firebug?
[19:06:41] <StephenS> if(response === "bla") { header(); }
[19:06:46] <shoky> look in your network tab to see what the PHP responds
[19:06:46] <StephenS> and header is executed always in php
[19:06:52] <LocalPCGuy> stephen or console.log(response)
[19:06:53] <StephenS> yes console is good
[19:07:00] <StephenS> I did all good
[19:07:00] <LocalPCGuy> and it shows "done"
[19:07:07] <StephenS> Yes on submission
[19:07:09] <shoky> StephenS:  what is the console log?
[19:07:22] <StephenS> debugger?
[19:07:24] <LocalPCGuy> and did you try response == "done"
[19:07:32] <LocalPCGuy> to see if it is a type issue
[19:07:44] <StephenS> no but I dont think it will help
[19:07:44] <LocalPCGuy> === compares value and type
[19:07:53] <shoky> StephenS:  just do what we're telling you
[19:07:53] <StephenS> sec
[19:07:55] <greengriminal> I have seletable() working however it seems to not be highlighting nor firing the dialog - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5201594 all that it is doing is the following: http://i.imgur.com/FxjhRKH.png when it should be highlighting the cells. Why is this not working?
[19:08:19] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, so it never gets into the true condition for response === "done"?
[19:08:22] <LocalPCGuy> is that the problem
[19:08:30] <LocalPCGuy> or is it just that it shows the errrordiv
[19:09:13] <pishposh> hey everyone! i'm struggling to get my script click function to hide() and show() the way i want. seems to be a problem with my node selectors. Please take a look if you're interested: https://github.com/desmondrawls/Game_Memory/blob/master/index.html
[19:09:14] <StephenS> here, from page source if(response == 'done') {
[19:09:14] <StephenS> 		this is php executed code		}else {
[19:09:14] <StephenS> 		$("#showerror").html(response).show();
[19:09:14] <StephenS> 		}
[19:09:29] <shoky> `demo @ greengriminal
[19:09:29] <b-ot> greengriminal: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:09:36] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, is it getting into the true condition of the IF statement?
[19:09:50] <StephenS> ha?>
[19:10:03] <shoky> StephenS:  console.log(response)  and tell us what it logs .
[19:10:07] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, does it redirect?
[19:10:21] <StephenS> how will redirect
[19:10:27] <StephenS> if I dont have header()
[19:10:45] <shoky> o.O
[19:10:59] <LocalPCGuy> <?php header("Location: index.php"); (btw- this is missing the ?>, I assume it is actually there in your code?)
[19:11:03] <pishposh> can a click method apply to a div that has only a class?  $('.className').click(function(){â€¦
[19:11:09] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, yes
[19:11:14] <StephenS> LocalPCGuy, yes it is
[19:11:15] <greengriminal> shoky: I cannot provide a working demo as my application is written in full JS. I am using Ruby on Rails. However i can give you access to my app if need me
[19:11:20] <greengriminal> shoky: be
[19:11:27] <StephenS> and no console.log does not even show response as submssion was not made
[19:11:38] <StephenS> I get unexpected error in colsole tho for my txt :(
[19:11:41] <LocalPCGuy> StephenS, so why not just hide #showerror before the IF
[19:11:47] <shoky> greengriminal: why cant you provide a working demo? it'll take maybe 5 min to set it up on jsfiddle, no?
[19:11:52] <StephenS> as you can see if does nothing
[19:12:07] <StephenS> all the code is executed no matter what but sure sec
[19:12:31] <chadkouse> I'm running jquery-ujs and for the life of me I can't figure out why ajax events aren't being triggered (or at least, the elements that are bound to them aren't receiving them) -- even the default ajax global events aren't working.  The AJAX post, however, works great..
[19:13:26] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, that is a lot of code in your github link, try making a working demo to show just the basics of what you are trying to do
[19:13:37] <StephenS> lol now done is displated in errordiv
[19:13:46] <StephenS> like there are no if statements in code at all
[19:13:50] <StephenS> what Im doing wrong ugh
[19:14:13] <pishposh> LocalPCGuy: will do
[19:20:27] <greengriminal> shoky: Basically take this example here that i've mocked up and is not working http://jsfiddle.net/skQqV/1/ what I am trying to do is upon selecting your boxes the dialog box appears
[19:21:25] <verism_> i gave it my best, but a jsfiddle just isn't possible - please see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15505620/browser-resize-condition-not-always-firing-properly
[19:22:01] <verism_> *jsfiddle recreation
[19:22:37] <shoky> greengriminal:  Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[19:23:06] <shoky> (and you didnt close the $(function() {....     )
[19:23:43] <pishposh> LocalPCGuy: http://jsfiddle.net/bznYn/
[19:23:45] <greengriminal> shoky: So i need to intialize it before i call the 'open'
[19:24:18] <shoky> greengriminal: of course
[19:24:26] <verism_> (working) jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/verism/cH66F/
[19:24:36] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, you are trying to attach the click event but the element doesn't exist at the time you are trying to attach the event.  You need to use event delegation
[19:24:53] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, so ... let me make a quick edit
[19:25:20] <pishposh> LocalPCGuy: yeah i've never heard of event delegation but it sounds like a party
[19:25:34] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, you are using jQuery 1.7+?
[19:25:59] <pishposh> LocalPCGuy: 1.7.1
[19:26:16] <greengriminal> okay got that working http://jsfiddle.net/skQqV/2/
[19:26:17] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, good - http://jsfiddle.net/bznYn/1/
[19:26:23] <shoky> verism_: honestly i didn't even understand the question
[19:26:31] <LocalPCGuy> ?on @ pishposh
[19:26:32] <bot-t> pishposh, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:27:20] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, basically, you are letting the click event "bubble" up to #photo_container and then checking to see if it was actually .flip_content that was clicked - if so, execute the function
[19:27:36] <verism_> damnit
[19:27:37] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, and that works for dynamic elements
[19:28:18] <pishposh> LocalPCGuy: thanks boss that's the understanding i was missing
[19:28:32] <verism_> basically, i'm comparing an element's height against anothers, and then doing one of two things, condition depending
[19:28:40] <pishposh> bot-t: thanks man
[19:28:40] * bot-t sighs
[19:28:51] <LocalPCGuy> pishposh, np
[19:29:13] <verism_> but it happens on a window resize, and doesn't always work
[19:29:21] <verism_> it's fairly niche
[19:29:41] <myndzi> anybody know why :hover was removed from (sizzle?) and is there an alternative?
[19:29:42] <shoky> verism_:  i see you have  $(this).width()/2
[19:30:03] <shoky> verism_:   why $(this) and not $(window) ?
[19:30:58] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, "As of 1.9, the event name string "hover" is no longer supported as a synonym for "mouseenter mouseleave". "
[19:31:13] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, so...seems like you should use mouseenter and mouseleave
[19:31:24] <StephenS> so no idea for me? :D
[19:31:38] <myndzi> :hover, the pseudo-selector
[19:31:40] <verism_> because i set the elemnt's width according to its height, which is defined by the window height
[19:31:45] <myndzi> as in foo.is(':hover')
[19:31:55] <LocalPCGuy> oh yah, I always get that mixed up
[19:32:00] <shoky> verism_:  but  in that scope,  this === window
[19:32:01] <Foxhoundz> myndzi: why not .hover()
[19:32:51] <myndzi> Foxhoundz: you mean the deprecated function? :P
[19:32:57] <Foxhoundz> ...
[19:33:06] <Foxhoundz> .it's deprecated?
[19:33:10] <myndzi> wow.
[19:33:12] <Foxhoundz> I need to upgrade my library
[19:33:13] <shoky> verism_:  $('#foo').css({ height: $(this).width() })   ===     var w = $(this).width();  $('#foo').css({ height: w });
[19:33:17] <myndzi> 19:30.46 < LocalPCGuy> myndzi, "As of 1.9, the event name string "hover" is no longer supported as a synonym for "mouseenter mouseleave". "
[19:33:24] <myndzi> and i'm not talking about the event anyway
[19:33:49] <Foxhoundz> I don't see anything about it being deprecated on the documentation
[19:33:53] <Foxhoundz> where are you getting this from?!
[19:34:01] <myndzi> google and this channel
[19:34:05] <Foxhoundz> ...
[19:34:06] <myndzi> like 15 lines up
[19:34:07] <Foxhoundz> and the documentation?
[19:34:42] <myndzi> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+1.9+deprecated+functions
[19:34:53] <shoky> verism_:  just sayin' , your code is depending on the fact that 'window' is the global, while i dont think you intended to do that
[19:34:58] <Foxhoundz> that doesn't come close to answering my question
[19:35:09] <Foxhoundz> I currently have the hover documentation page open
[19:35:18] <Foxhoundz> and there's no indication that the method was deprecated
[19:35:21] <myndzi> ....
[19:35:23] <tw2113> and documentation can be outofdate
[19:35:24] <myndzi> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#hover-pseudo-event
[19:35:26] <myndzi> the first result
[19:35:27] <shoky> verism_: well, not the global, but the default value of 'this'
[19:35:28] <myndzi> after searching
[19:35:29] <myndzi> jesus
[19:35:35] <Foxhoundz> tw2113: that was the point I was trying to get across :)
[19:35:57] <LocalPCGuy> according to this SO, :hover is a CSS pseudo-class, not a jQuery selector. It cannot be reliably used with is() on all browsers.
[19:35:58] <tw2113> so make an issue on the docs over on github
[19:36:06] <LocalPCGuy> http://stackoverflow.com/a/8010298
[19:36:52] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, and this one gives code to determine if the mouse is over an element or not (assuming that is the goal) http://stackoverflow.com/a/1670561
[19:36:53] <tw2113> "As of 1.9, the event name string "hover" is no longer supported as a synonym for "mouseenter mouseleave""
[19:37:05] <tw2113> i don't think they're talking about the .hover() method
[19:37:18] <verism_> i realise that - the problem really lies in the problemFunc()
[19:37:23] <myndzi> that is the goal, but the question was "why was :hover deprecated"
[19:37:32] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113, he's talking about the :hover psuedo-class which can't be reliably used in all browser
[19:37:32] <myndzi> i'm quite capable of finding workarounds :P
[19:37:43] <myndzi> it's worked for me before
[19:37:43] <tw2113> :hover !== .hover()
[19:37:44] <Foxhoundz> tsk tsk myndzi
[19:37:50] <myndzi> on this same browser
[19:37:54] <myndzi> now i get a console error
[19:38:00] <myndzi> that's what i was asking after
[19:38:02] <tw2113> glad i could help everyone
[19:38:05] <verism_> what's doubly annoying is this can't be replicated in jsfiddle - the example i posted was more for reference sake
[19:38:20] <myndzi> when you say it's not reliable in all browsers, is that current browsers or like, IE6?
[19:38:20] * tw2113 drinks
[19:38:33] <tw2113> the only reliable thing in ie6 is fail
[19:38:38] <LocalPCGuy> like - I wouldn't trust it in a production environment
[19:38:39] <myndzi> hehe
[19:38:45] <LocalPCGuy> period
[19:39:11] <myndzi> well it's fixing a minor edge case graphical glitch anyway, and the site is not going to support old versions of IE
[19:39:17] <jrajav> Nobody trusts anything in a production environment
[19:39:18] <myndzi> so the question is, what makes it unreliable and in which browsers?
[19:39:20] <jrajav> If they do, fire them
[19:39:24] <tw2113> IE6 does two things, one spectacularly well, one "meh"
[19:39:34] <tw2113> and those are fail and download other browsers
[19:40:29] <tw2113> i don't consider IE6 a browser any more
[19:40:42] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, and you did ask for an alternative in your question ;)
[19:41:42] <myndzi> note the "and" :P
[19:41:55] <myndzi> and by alternative i meant, is it deprecated in favor of something new and what is that new thing
[19:42:37] <coldhead> lol production
[19:42:42] <tw2113> mouseenter/mouseleave ?
[19:43:11] <tw2113> coldhead, i wish WordPress was more like jQuery
[19:43:49] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, jQuery is unable to resolve dynamic pseudo-classes, such as :link/:visited for hyperlinks and :hover, :active and :focus for user interaction. The latter set of pseudo-classes in particular are state-based and not event-based, so you need to use event handlers rather than pseudo-classes to run code when elements enter and leave these states. See this answer for an explanation.
[19:44:59] <myndzi> .is(':hover') comes from a number of SO answers, and if you test in jquery 1.71 it works; the reason i'm trying to use it is because i'm getting extra drag enter/leave events that are screwing things up and i want to abort early if the mouse is still over the object
[19:45:23] <myndzi> so, yes: it worked, now it doesn't, i'm curious why
[19:45:39] <tw2113> because they removed it as a synonym for mouseenter/mouseleave in 1.9
[19:45:49] <tw2113> if you want to stick with 1.71 and use it, go for it
[19:46:11] <myndzi> ...
[19:46:19] <myndzi> i'm not talking about the event, i'm talking about the css pseudo-selector
[19:46:27] <myndzi> http://jsfiddle.net/Meligy/2kyaJ/3/
[19:46:27] <tw2113> and that's what was depreciated
[19:46:32] <LocalPCGuy> speculating, but it was probably removed because it was unreliable to test against
[19:46:42] <myndzi> that's not what was deprecated
[19:46:44] <tw2113> deprecated
[19:46:54] <tw2113> damn my spelling
[19:47:05] <myndzi> the .hover pseudo-event is what was deprecated
[19:47:17] <myndzi> the :hover pseudo-selector is no longer supported in sizzle or something
[19:47:18] <tw2113> no .hover the method wasn't
[19:47:26] <myndzi> jesus
[19:47:33] <myndzi> i just got done proving this to LocalPCGuy
[19:47:44] <myndzi> usually it's the newbies asking for help that are dense
[19:47:54] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, I acutally think you are missing "deprecated" with "never worked properly to begin with so was then removed from sizzle"
[19:47:58] <myndzi> As of 1.9, the event name string "hover" is no longer supported as a synonym for "mouseenter mouseleave". This allows applications to attach and trigger a custom "hover" event. Changing existing code is a simple find/replace, and the "hover" pseudo-event is also supported in the jQuery Migrate plugin to simplify migration.
[19:48:05] <greengriminal> at this moment it does --> http://i.imgur.com/FxjhRKH.png however it is not highlighting any cells nor rending the dialog if that make sense
[19:48:20] <myndzi> LocalPCGuy: that would be an answer i'm looking for, i was just hoping for an official reference
[19:48:25] <tw2113> supported in terms of being detected to move away from is how i read that
[19:48:27] <myndzi> or rather, that someone knew what i was talking about
[19:49:42] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, btw, I like the top portion of this answer where it adds a "hovering" data attribute to the item in question using .hover (which would need to be mouseenter/mouseout, of course) http://stackoverflow.com/a/11771202
[19:50:10] <myndzi> trouble is, because the glitch is screwing with my mouseout/mousein, i can't use that :\
[19:50:27] <tw2113> myndzi, just to clear my head, you think .hover() is deprecated?
[19:50:39] <LocalPCGuy> why not fix the glitch instead of trying to trap the error?
[19:50:43] <LocalPCGuy> curious
[19:52:25] <myndzi> the whole point was to add a selector on mouse in
[19:52:25] <myndzi> and remove it on mouse out
[19:52:25] <myndzi> excuse me, i'm talking about dragover and dragleave, not mouseenter/mouseout
[19:52:25] <myndzi> anyway, i'll just have to do something else, but the question has made me curious so i'll be digging through github for a while
[19:52:39] <myndzi> tw2113: it says so on the jquery page itself in the list of changes for 1.9
[19:52:54] <myndzi> i'm uncertain if the glitch is supposed to happen or not, and i've tried a number of fixes
[19:52:55] <tw2113> jquery-latest.js
[19:53:00] <tw2113> jQuery.fn.hover = function( fnOver, fnOut )
[19:53:07] <myndzi> i'll end up finding something, but after having to get into it so deep i was curious
[19:53:32] <myndzi> tw2113: then i guess it's the upgrade page that's wrong
[19:53:34] <LocalPCGuy> sizzle docs: For instance, the following pseudo-selectors are not supported- :hover
[19:53:34] <tw2113> return this.mouseenter( fnOver ).mouseleave( fnOut || fnOver ); };
[19:53:44] <tw2113> i think you're confusing .hover() with :hover
[19:53:51] <tw2113> with the latter being the one that's deprecated
[19:55:02] <tw2113> and it'd be something like $('a:hover') that was done away with due to unreliability
[19:55:11] <innociv> oh wow...  Um so I have a 20x20 pixel png.  Why is the canvas.imageData.data array 1599 long?  20*20*3 is 1200.  Is one alpha too?  I guess that's it..
[19:55:48] <tw2113> does a same dimension jg return 1200?
[19:56:10] <tw2113> jpg
[19:56:41] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, So...here is about as official as it'll get: :hover // this requires adding a special event to the DOM in unsupported browsers, we're not going to do this
[19:56:51] <scar> im using .on('click', function() {}) and trying to prevent the item from being clicked / activated until it actually is done processing the action. however, the only way i can think of is to disable the selector/trigger and then enable. however, disabling is still not preventing the click from firing. any ideas?
[19:57:02] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, After more investigation, support for :link, :visited, and :hover cannot be added without adding events to the DOM to keep track of state. These will remain unsupported to minimize Sizzle's footprint on the DOM.
[19:57:06] <scar> so if a user double clicks it, it doesnt screw up
[19:57:09] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/44
[19:57:10] <b-ot> LocalPCGuy: Issue #44 by barraponto (26mon 4w ago): CSS3 Selector compatibility
[19:57:33] <scar> i even tried to return false; if the trigger was disabled ( i checked for .attr('disabled')
[19:58:39] <myndzi> LocalPCGuy: was just reading that, still trying to find out why it worked in 1.7
[19:58:46] <LocalPCGuy> luck
[19:58:47] <myndzi> thanks
[19:58:59] <geoous> anyone knows how to fix a bug when we want to type something inside a box the text goes outside of it?
[19:59:20] <LocalPCGuy> that issue was from 2 years ago, so it wasn't that it "worked" because of something that was removed, it was that it worked in spite of them not supporting it
[19:59:40] <myndzi> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12736
[19:59:48] <myndzi> ^ looks like that's what happened
[20:00:01] <myndzi> jquery implemented a hack and they removed it now
[20:00:07] <myndzi> it never was in sizzle
[20:00:18] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[20:00:29] <myndzi> er wtf
[20:00:39] <myndzi> that's the event, nm
[20:00:49] <myndzi> it said pseudo:hover so i thought it was talking css
[20:01:29] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, no, that was for :hover
[20:01:46] <myndzi> click the pull request link
[20:01:48] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, var rhoverHack = /(?:^|\s)hover(\.\S+|)\b/
[20:01:57] <myndzi> "Move hoverHack for 'hover' -> 'mouseover' 'mouseout' to deprecated.js"
[20:02:01] <LocalPCGuy> no regex expert, but pretty sure that matches :hover
[20:02:25] <myndzi> (?:etc) means it's a non capturing group
[20:02:45] <LocalPCGuy> ah...well, yah, then it's the event :P
[20:02:48] <myndzi> it's matching hover with the start of line or whitespace before and .nonwhitespace after
[20:03:34] <myndzi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15079708/jquery-why-does-hover-work-only-once
[20:03:39] <LocalPCGuy> but I bet you will find that it wasn't sizzle but jquery that "worked"
[20:03:54] <myndzi> apparently there was simply not a rule to disallow it in sizzle(?)
[20:04:39] <myndzi> hum, well, better get back to finding the problem :P
[20:04:44] <LocalPCGuy> prbly
[20:05:11] <myndzi> can you think of any reason why changing classes on a hovered element would re-trigger dragenter/dragleave events?
[20:05:18] <maskio> how do i disable a combobox? self disable on ajax call and re-enable on success.
[20:06:01] <LocalPCGuy> not offhand, but that doesn't mean it won't obviously.  using UI draggable/droppable?
[20:06:10] <myndzi> no
[20:06:43] <myndzi> when i start dragging an item, it does a quick 70ms transition to opacity 0, changes the background image, and another 70ms transition to opacity 1
[20:06:48] <myndzi> (not the dragged item)
[20:07:04] <myndzi> when the dragged item hovers over the icon, it adds a class to highlight it
[20:07:08] <myndzi> and when it leaves, it removes the class
[20:07:17] <myndzi> if i drag and wait for the transition to complete it works as expected
[20:07:36] <myndzi> console.log shows that it spams a couple extra dragenter/dragleave events if i drag it over before the transition completes, and it winds up without the class i want on it
[20:07:49] <myndzi> it's kinda weird, because i'm pretty sure dragenter is the last event
[20:08:00] <myndzi> may be some kind of race condition
[20:13:48] <myndzi> here's the sequence if you're curious
[20:13:48] <myndzi> http://pastebin.com/jvBtvDC3
[20:13:48] <myndzi> two enters one leave, then one enter two leaves
[20:13:48] <myndzi> lol
[20:13:48] <myndzi> that'd explain it
[20:13:49] <myndzi> i guess it means i can increment/decrement a counter
[20:16:06] <myndzi> counter works :)
[20:17:04] <LocalPCGuy> myndzi, adding a class to the dom triggers a repaint, I wonder if the repaint is triggering your dragevent
[20:17:07] <LocalPCGuy> s
[20:25:09] <sunuslee> a from's height in firefox is two time bigger than it in safari, why?
[20:32:32] <abes> Question: I am implementing an jQuer-aim-menu (https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim) and here is my funciton which makes the menu items activate/deactivate along with their appropriate content divs (makes them visible/invisible) - http://pastebin.com/maiY2fs3 - how can I call a deactivate function for particular element from outside this function?
[20:33:13] <abes> I have a separate div that when hovered displays the menu, but when i hover out of the the menu, the last item doesn't get deactivated
[20:38:31] <sunuslee> firebug script in chrom, Access to restricted URI deniedâ€¦ anyone know how to debug? it works fine in firefox
[20:46:03] <rael> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form  <-- they write the user input back on line 80, can you write back to a location relative to the button that was clicked to open the form?
[20:46:49] <Guddu> Dear friends....The selector $('#id_entered_pack_qty').length is always returning one when I have atleast 10 elements with matching ID (dynamically added)...What could be the issue?
[20:47:22] <coldhead> Guddu: the issue is that IDs must be unique
[20:47:30] <coldhead> you only get to use an ID once per page
[20:47:35] <coldhead> jQuery is obeying this law
[20:47:40] <coldhead> and only bothering to find one
[20:47:48] <Guddu> coldhead, Thanks
[20:47:50] <coldhead> you should use classes instead of duplicate IDs
[20:48:44] <Guddu> coldhead, For an input element "name" can be same across mutiple such inputs though right?
[20:48:58] <abes> Question: I've somebody include two function in a row, one was for .hover and the other seemed like it was called when .hover no longer applied - what's the syntax for that?
[20:49:04] <coldhead> yes, although they should be in different <form>s
[20:49:10] <coldhead> otherwise you might have problems
[20:49:44] <coldhead> hover(mouse_in, mouse_out)
[20:49:50] <coldhead> where mouse_in and mouse_out are functions
[20:50:08] <Guddu> coldhead, I have them in same form..basically multipl dynamic rows....If the name cannot be same then there is no way to predict how many actually  get added when i process the form on server...
[20:50:15] <abes> coldhead: how does that differ from .mouseenter and .mouseleave?
[20:50:34] <coldhead> abes: less typing
[20:50:48] <coldhead> .hover() vs .mouseenter() and .mouseleave()
[20:50:51] <HFranks> I think I might be expecting a bit too much and need some help with selectors: http://jsfiddle.net/G2QEs/5/  .. When you slide the top slider it should be changing the filter attribute.. I even tagged it with an ID for certainty and no joy?
[20:50:53] <coldhead> use whhichever you prefer
[20:53:31] <coldhead> HFranks: i don't think you can select SVG elements with jQuery
[20:53:59] <HFranks> coldhead: Hmmm what does it mind?? ;)
[20:54:14] <mmlac> If I want to write a script that embeds a reader on another page, I have to do an iframe if I need to make AJAX calls to let's say example.com and the script runs at foo.com, correct?
[20:54:21] <coldhead> i am wrong, it looks like you can
[20:54:28] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/G2QEs/6/
[20:54:34] <coldhead> ignore me, i am a big fat stupid fatty
[20:54:46] <mmlac> and yes, SVG should work like normal DOM if I remember correctly
[20:54:55] <mmlac> had to fiddle around with it some time ago
[20:56:12] <coldhead> seems to be doing the right thing http://jsfiddle.net/G2QEs/7/
[20:56:27] <coldhead> maybe SVG doesn't notice changes made after it's been rendered?
[21:03:14] <Guddu> coldhead, I have this HTML snippet http://dpaste.com/1028532/ . . . I am using The following to select the containing <tr> of any input but it seems to be not selecting
[21:03:17] <Guddu> $('input[name="entered_pack_qty"]').first().prev('tr')
[21:05:24] <Guddu> is 'tr' not a valid seletor?
[21:06:39] <coldhead> i don't think prev() does what you think it does
[21:06:44] <coldhead> you maybe want to use ?closest
[21:06:44] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:06:54] <coldhead> prev is for siblings, not ancestors
[21:07:12] <Guddu> Thanks coldhead That explains it
[21:07:46] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:07:47] <b-ot> coldhead: CASE CLOASED >:|
[21:07:47] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[21:08:20] <LocalPCGuy> prev also has an annoying habit of only looking at the element just before the one you call it on and only selecting it if it matches the selector; it doesn't keep checking until it finds the "prev" element that matches the selector
[21:08:26] <LocalPCGuy> i dunno, annoying to me
[21:09:59] <grafi> so closest doesnt find element after the element im starting from?
[21:10:18] <grafi> or does it go both ways
[21:10:22] <coldhead> LocalPCGuy: prevAll()
[21:10:41] <LocalPCGuy> coldhead prevAll('li').eq(0) to be precise
[21:10:41] <coldhead> next() does the other way
[21:10:49] <coldhead> pfft
[21:10:53] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[21:10:57] <coldhead> .prevAll('li:first')
[21:11:05] <LocalPCGuy> meh, I like .eq(0)
[21:12:52] <coldhead> i don't want to spend all day typing jquery
[21:15:15] <coldhead> why am i even on this channel >: |
[21:15:20] <HFranks> coldhead: <feSpecularLighting in="blur" id="bibbles" surfaceScale="5" specularConstant=".25" specularExponent="20" lighting-color="#bbbbbb" result="specOut" specularconstant="0.18">  (So it's somehow dropping the case of the attribute?!)
[21:15:24] <coldhead> you people are all obsessed with jquery
[21:15:31] <coldhead> oh gross HFranks
[21:15:33] <coldhead> so gross
[21:15:57] <coldhead> HFranks: i guess you have to mess with the element directly, rather than through jquery
[21:16:53] <LocalPCGuy> HFranks, html is case insensitive
[21:17:05] <LocalPCGuy> and that is ugly, fwiw
[21:17:05] <HFranks> ^ This
[21:17:50] <sunuslee> in javascript. object.height() get different value in webit and gekco, any idea to make them both to work?
[21:18:39] <HFranks> Ugly as in it's not charming/artistic or ugly as in attacking it head on vs. some lib designed to be more elegant with SVG filters?
[21:20:14] <HFranks> Cause I didn't draw it, and I was just curious how quickly I could have a dynamic CSS filter demo, wasn't trying to be elegant really. ;)
[21:21:52] <LocalPCGuy> more just ugly cause it has all the presentational stuff in a tag, if it is SVG or something other than HTML I guess I take it back
[21:30:38] <HFranks> Yep.. Just an SVG. Looks like the attribute actually becomes an 'SVGAnimatedString' object inside the browser. So when I set the attribute it did pass it along, but didn't effect the object that the browser is rendering?
[21:31:28] <SuperNoeMan> hey, I'm trying to set up a visual studio web forms project to work with jquery
[21:31:35] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have this dialog box. when i check in firebug th evalue of the z-index comes under inline style. How is this value being set?
[21:31:40] <sheilablackrose> i bnever used dialog box before
[21:32:01] <SuperNoeMan> and the problem is, I'm nervous that because it came with one, I can't use the nuget package manager to add it
[21:34:59] <SuperNoeMan> so, using nuget, I get two jquery packages in my web forms at the same time
[21:35:00] <SuperNoeMan> ...
[21:40:48] <iurimartins08> hi
[21:41:19] <iurimartins08> i need some help with jquery library, can u help me?
[21:42:28] <iurimartins08> hi
[21:42:49] <iurimartins08> someone there?
[21:43:02] <SuperNoeMan> iurimartins08: I'm working on jquery library in visual studio web forms project
[21:43:08] <SuperNoeMan> perhaps we have the same issue?
[21:43:39] <iurimartins08> i don't know, i never used jquery... that's why :S
[21:44:56] <iurimartins08> when i press one button, must appear one image... i don't know how to do it with jquery
[21:46:13] <dytrivedi> hey iurimartins08
[21:46:22] <dytrivedi> how're you, my man?
[21:48:10] <iurimartins08> i'm good
[21:48:18] <dytrivedi> iurimartins08: you've used GTD lately?
[21:48:19] <iurimartins08> well not good but u understand
[21:48:26] <iurimartins08> gtd?
[21:48:33] <dytrivedi> Getting Things Done
[21:48:55] <iurimartins08> i think so
[21:49:17] <dytrivedi> Hmm, tough
[21:49:31] <dytrivedi> then you're not using GTD enabled jQuery
[21:49:48] <dytrivedi> because GTD enabled jQuery GETS THINGS DONE
[21:49:55] <iurimartins08> i'm doing a project for school, and i need to use jquery, but i was on the hospital so i didn't catch that parta in school...
[21:50:02] <iurimartins08> true i'm not :S
[21:50:05] <SuperNoeMan> anybody able to help with jquery in a visual studio web forms project?
[21:50:15] <iurimartins08> what program do u use? i use dream weaver
[21:50:35] <SuperNoeMan> just visual studio
[21:50:40] <SuperNoeMan> honestly, my issue is this:
[21:50:47] <dytrivedi> I use a magnet to directly change bits in my hard disk
[21:50:57] <SuperNoeMan> visual studio seems to bundle jquery with its web forms projects, so that when you create a new one
[21:51:12] <dytrivedi> although, it may not work unless you're high
[21:51:16] <dytrivedi> WITH BHANG
[21:51:41] <SuperNoeMan> look-I know its microsoft's stuff, but its a school project and our sponsor supported this
[21:51:52] <SuperNoeMan> school project -> college senior design proejct
[21:52:01] <SuperNoeMan> so, I'm stuck with visual studio
[21:52:40] <SuperNoeMan> so when you create a new one, you get jquery. But the jquery you get is out of date. And using nuget package manager, you get an entirely new jquery, now with two
[21:53:27] <dytrivedi> SuperNoeMan: so you replace it in yo source
[21:53:50] <SuperNoeMan> its a brand new project. From what I understand, we haven't referenced jquery, so
[21:54:26] <SuperNoeMan> I'm concerned that things will break if I remove the old one. Plus, there's no automated way to remove old one
[21:54:41] <dytrivedi> man
[21:54:54] <wookiehangover> oh, nuget package manager, npm
[21:55:34] <SuperNoeMan> the old one wasn't installed with nuget package manager. there's an automated way to remove the new one, but that is self defeating
[21:55:42] <wookiehangover> not be confused with the "other" npm
[21:55:47] <wookiehangover> the nugent pacakge manager http://tropicsofmeta.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/nugent-scream-dream.jpg
[21:56:02] <grafi> oÃ´
[21:56:08] <grafi> too much npm entirely
[21:56:34] <coldhead> yes, wookiehangover. this.
[21:56:59] <pixelBash> using version control like git? test and revert if necessary?
[21:59:42] <SuperNoeMan> pixelBash: well yeah, but I'm hoping to find someone that has addressed this before, since if I'm getting it then others are as well
[22:00:21] <grafi> try google
[22:00:28] <grafi> i hear he has great experience
[22:01:12] <SuperNoeMan> doing it at the same time for the past hour
[22:01:19] <SuperNoeMan> grafi: ^
[22:01:21] <grafi> and no luck
[22:01:24] <grafi> thats hard
[22:01:39] <SuperNoeMan> some luck, but its not directly applicable. I'm looking for directly applicable advice
[22:02:05] <iurimartins08>  i need to do one table where on the left side is buttons, on the other side shows images when i click the buttons, i need to u jquery to do the clicking thing :S
[22:02:11] <iurimartins08> someone know how can i do it?
[22:02:41] <pixelBash> read the docs?
[22:02:50] <pixelBash> @iurimartins08
[22:03:18] <coldhead> I ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH RAEL
[22:03:24] <pixelBash> im not sure what the problem is SuperNoeMan, you want to upgrade but know in advance if it will break anything? or just upgrade
[22:04:01] <rael> lol calmez-vous
[22:04:04] <pixelBash> because the only real way to know what will break is to read the release notes between the two versions... or try it
[22:04:24] <SuperNoeMan> pixelBash: there are two jquery instances in my web forms project, there should only every be one, am I right?
[22:04:36] <grafi> just delete the older one
[22:04:42] <grafi> and be done with it
[22:05:42] <pixelBash> in my experience the only thing that tends to break is stuff like .live()
[22:06:12] <pixelBash> yeah but its pretty robust, are they both being included in the same place? like right after each other
[22:07:12] <SuperNoeMan> pixelBash: well, they both have some files in the scripts folder
[22:07:31] <SuperNoeMan> but to be honest, this is my first web forms project, so I don't know where all the other stuff jquery is supposed to have is
[22:07:45] <initself> hey yo
[22:07:48] <initself> this works: $('select[name="list_type_id"]').change(function() {
[22:07:53] <SuperNoeMan> I would think jquery would be a fat ass collection of files. I've never even used it, so you guys are all way ahead of me.
[22:08:12] <initself> but how can i get it to trigger on page load where it not only runs on .change, but runs for that selector on the first page load?
[22:08:13] <SuperNoeMan> initself: ? me?
[22:08:17] <SuperNoeMan> oh
[22:08:20] <SuperNoeMan> nevermind
[22:08:51] <initself> SuperNoeMan: I dont think it works to have jQuery running all over your code base
[22:08:57] <initself> it doesn't need to only be in one place
[22:09:21] <initself> it's gonna run every time a page loads, for the most part
[22:09:21] <SuperNoeMan> initself: I don't know where nuget installs jquery. and, I didn't put jquery anywhere
[22:09:32] <initself> hrm
[22:09:39] <iurimartins08> how can u "instal" jquery in dreamweaver?
[22:09:43] <initself> SuperNoeMan: I am not sure what you are trying to solve, i just started looking at the channel.
[22:09:56] <pixelBash> SuperNoeMan: jquery is normally just one file
[22:10:06] <SuperNoeMan> other than where nuget put it, and where the new web forms project wizard put it
[22:10:08] <pixelBash> SuperNoeMan: and typically a bunch of plugins
[22:10:18] <initself> SuperNoeMan: my jQuery runns like this
[22:10:18] <initself> script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:10:24] <dblosevn> hey, is there a method simliar to ajax.preFilter that attaches to all ajax requests and previews the response before sending to the callback? something like ajax.postFilter except i dont see postfilter in the docs
[22:10:36] <SuperNoeMan> initself: I have no idea where you're coming from with what you're saying
[22:10:54] <SuperNoeMan> It sounds like you have a problem you're trying to solve, but like I said, I'm complete novice at jquery
[22:11:12] <initself> hey look, other people have my problem!
[22:11:13] <initself> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579658/jquery-is-there-a-tag-like-change-that-also-runs-on-page-load
[22:11:21] <SuperNoeMan> pixelBash: "and typically a bunch of plugins" ??? sounds like a slice of sentence...
[22:11:41] <pixelBash> before that -> jquery is normally just one file
[22:11:52] <dblosevn> eg a global listener to determine if a user is no longer logged in and display a login screen
[22:12:06] <iurimartins08> someone portuguese ?
[22:12:09] <SuperNoeMan> pixelBash: ah, that answers a little bit.
[22:12:34] <pixelBash> SuperNoeMan: This *is* jquery https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js
[22:12:43] <pixelBash> version 1.7.1 to be exact
[22:12:51] <SuperNoeMan> so if I delete jquery-1.7.1.js and jquery-1.7.1.min.js
[22:13:11] <SuperNoeMan> 1.7.1???
[22:13:16] <SuperNoeMan> what?
[22:13:18] <pixelBash> im not hot on visual studio but cant you just delete the line where it includes the js file
[22:13:22] <SuperNoeMan> nuget puts my jquery at 1.9.1
[22:13:28] <pixelBash> thats pretty recent
[22:13:50] <pixelBash> the most recent
[22:13:51] <SuperNoeMan> yeah, the nuget packages jquery ui and juice ui both require
[22:13:58] <SuperNoeMan> jquery version > 1.8.0
[22:14:02] <pixelBash> ah i see
[22:14:14] <pixelBash> how much code relies on 1.7.1 or do you not know that
[22:14:15] <SuperNoeMan> see that's why I have to have jquery all be used at one version
[22:14:17] <SuperNoeMan> 1.9.1
[22:14:21] <SuperNoeMan> I have no idea
[22:14:50] <SuperNoeMan> this was an empty web app project that was upgraded to a web forms project with some login stuff
[22:15:02] <SuperNoeMan> so, I have no idea what relies on 1.7.1
[22:15:14] <SuperNoeMan> I'm guessing there's a way to search through the whole project for 1.7?
[22:15:17] <SuperNoeMan> or the include line?
[22:15:25] <pixelBash> cant your IDE do that?
[22:15:28] <pixelBash> search in files
[22:15:30] <SuperNoeMan> I'm sure
[22:15:36] <SuperNoeMan> that's what I was talking about.
[22:15:42] <SuperNoeMan> but I'm not so hot with Visual Studio either
[22:15:45] <SuperNoeMan> I'm an eclipse guy
[22:15:53] <pixelBash> sublime text ftw
[22:16:01] <SuperNoeMan> to be honest, this whole senior project thing has got me way out of kilter
[22:16:12] <SuperNoeMan> well, I say eclipse, but I use vim as much as possible
[22:16:13] <pixelBash> might have more luck in a visual studio channel
[22:16:18] <pixelBash> tbh
[22:16:34] <SuperNoeMan> right, I was looking for one, but there's not a #visualstudio to my knowledge
[22:16:50] <pixelBash> ill stick to php thanks haha
[22:16:56] <pixelBash> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dechx2tz(v=vs.80).aspx
[22:16:59] <pixelBash> this help?
[22:17:10] <SuperNoeMan> oh
[22:17:18] <SuperNoeMan> ok, so what include statement am I looking for?
[22:18:06] <pixelBash> jquery.js probably
[22:18:16] <pixelBash> jquery.1.7.1.min.js
[22:18:17] <Konst> I am trying to read text from an XML file and the text in the XML file contains html code examples which the .text(); method is ignoring. What can I do to have those html tags appear as text.

[22:45:10] <Mr_Grim> hey guys? is it possible to select all href links that begin with #?\
[22:45:37] <nardev> dblosevn, Whenever an Ajax request completes successfully, jQuery triggers the ajaxSuccess event. Any and all handlers that have been registered with the .ajaxSuccess() method are executed at this time.
[22:46:00] <dblosevn> what is the firing order is my question
[22:46:44] <dblosevn> eg $(document).ajaxSuccess(function() { }); $.get('xhr.php', function() { } );
[22:46:45] <nardev> as you see, i copied that from web, i assume it's after
[22:47:08] <dblosevn> would the get callback fire before or after the success
[22:48:04] <dblosevn> being the success listener is bound before the get i would assume it would be fired first
[22:50:34] <dblosevn> but it would appear im wrong :-(

[23:13:06] <vacho> that's what I get shoky
[23:13:14] <shoky> replace obj with your object name...

[23:13:55] <vacho> $.each( data.s_t, function(i, val) { alert(val); });
[23:14:27] <shoky> assuming data is an object, yeah
[23:14:45] <shoky> except the alert :\
[23:15:07] <tw2113> alert is for amateurs
[23:15:29] <tw2113> professionals console.log()
[23:16:22] <vacho> that worked!

[23:17:07] <vacho> is there a way I can get next value in the loop?
[23:17:07] <coldhead> great work vacho
[23:17:25] <shoky> i is the current index
[23:17:49] <vacho> data.s_t[i] ?
[23:18:00] <tw2113> you can use numerals to reference specific indexes

[23:39:44] <nardev> dblosevn, doesn't work for me :( it's bg image of html tag
[23:39:57] <dblosevn> read the answer
[23:40:19] <dblosevn> it will have to be an html tag as there is no way to animate a background-image
[23:40:20] <tw2113> people still attach bg images on the html tag?
[23:40:28] <nardev> dblosevn, i read it 10 miinutes ago
[23:40:46] <dblosevn> without a crazy plugin
[23:40:57] <tw2113> use CSS for your bg images
[23:41:17] <dblosevn> that would basically create an overlay with the new background behind the element with the old background and fade the old one
[23:42:01] <nardev> tw2113, i need full page bg image check www.streljana.ba
[23:42:09] <jon_x2> oops I'm in jquery sorry
[23:42:16] <tw2113> that's nice
[23:42:37] <tw2113> http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/
[23:43:05] <nardev> tw2113, the problem here is that with fade in i fade everything on page
[23:43:21] <nardev> can i fadeIn only css change?
[23:43:37] <dblosevn> you are fading body
[23:43:48] <dblosevn> of course it will fade the whole page
[23:44:18] <dblosevn> well technically your fading html
[23:44:20] <nardev> dblosevn, no, i'm fading html now check out streljana.ba
[23:44:30] <dblosevn> which is the parent of body
[23:44:40] <dblosevn> so your fading body as well
[23:47:20] <nardev> dblosevn, i think that  jquery.backstretch.min.js  solved the issue :D
[23:48:08] <dblosevn> that does exactly what i told you you needed to do
[23:48:31] <dblosevn> sort of it actually uses image tags instead of background-image
[23:49:51] <nardev> thank you dblosevn
[23:50:09] <dblosevn> now if somebody could just help me lmao
[23:50:17] <dblosevn> been stuck for 4 hours

[23:50:39] <dblosevn> wow its 3 am make that 7 hours
[23:51:11] <nardev> dblosevn, it's 7:51 over here :D
[23:52:06] <b1lly> yo
[23:58:26] <dblosevn> oh well it works firing after the other callbacks but i would really rather it work before
