[00:25:38] <bittyx-work> hi all. i need to bind an event to when something is clicked other than a certain element on a page. i've tried doing it with $(document).on('click', ':not[div#special]', function(e){}), but this usually fires many times due to propagation. but i'm pretty sure i don't want to do e.preventDefault() here, since it may mess with other events on the page. or am i wrong about this?\

[01:18:41] <mindis|wurk> gentlemen. anyone got tips how to retrieve the complete html of an iframes content? not just head, body or <html> but all of it

[01:20:39] <Whirl3d> mehdrad, you are such a pain in the ass. I argued with you for an hour yesterday that whenever you see this.jquerymethod it has to be a plugin and you swore it wasn't. Now the problem lines you mention are this.something and THEY ARE PART OF A PLUGIN
[01:20:57] <Whirl3d> you lie, refuse to learn, refuse to take advise...I'm out of here.

[01:30:02] <mehrdad> it was someone else i talked to yesterday :/
[01:36:33] <mehrdad> now i think more about it, i can't be sure if it was him or someone else

[01:37:40] <lucasw> Hi, ive got a random number of divs in my site, each div get its unique id on pagerender, how can i write a function that every click on a link opens up their own hidden div? I mean on one site i can have 4 different hidden divs that each have a link and when i click one link that specific div that belongs to that link should become visible, how can this be done? One page could contain 3 links,
[01:37:40] <lucasw> another one could contain 10, and another one could contain 7 so there isnt the same every time, can this be done?
[01:40:08] <bigkevmcd> lucasw: is there some way to identify the div from the link?
[01:44:57] <lucasw> bigkevmcd yes, they all have this kind of id: start_ctl01_lista but the number 01 changes so everyone have their own number like so: start_ctl01_lista, start_ctl02_lista, start_ctl03_lista but i prefer not to hardcode every animation
[01:45:42] <bigkevmcd> lucasw: yeah, but from the link, can you work out which div? i.e. is there a correlation between the id of the link, and the id of the div you want to expand?
[01:46:15] <bigkevmcd> lucasw: if so, you can handle the click on the link with a function which calculates the div id from the id of the link, and expand it
[01:49:15] <mehrdad> whirled u jackass
[01:49:44] <mehrdad> i was talkin about foreach yesterday not this one
[01:49:55] <mehrdad> this problem is different
[01:50:23] <lucasw> bigkevmcd okay, do you have any information i can read about it or similar? any similar function that im looking for? :)
[01:50:42] <mathi> hi
[01:50:55] <Sebah> hello! I have something like '$(this).parent().data('video-enabled', true)' in my code. I've been wondering how can I access the elements with .data('video-enabled', false). Basically I'm trying to close all the div's with 'false' attribute for the 'video-enabled'
[01:51:24] <mathi> the following line takes about 250 miliseconds: var jData = $(data);    because data contains HTML and it's pretty huge
[01:51:47] <mathi> and it blocks the interface
[01:53:13] <AdvoWork> Hi there, i've got a <td> which is <td data-row_count="1">  where 1 is incremental, how can i use that? ie i'm trying to get the value from an input field within that td?
[01:55:07] <sahbeewah> needs more info... but probably: $(this).closest("td").data("row_count");
[01:55:09] <bigkevmcd> lucasw: something like this http://pastebin.com/G9Gma4fg
[01:55:53] <pflock> any idea why this script: ( http://pastebin.com/8TyL8eVz ) always alerts "Couldn't post. Error: 1" ? If data=1 it should alert "Submitted"...
[01:57:48] <AdvoWork> sahbeewah, can i get the closest td with an id? ie <tr id="470" name="price_break_row_existing" data-row_count="0"><td class="col1 cell"><input type="text" name="data-vendor_item_id=" 472"="" id="existing_price_break_quantity_470" value="1"></td> </tr>
[01:58:26] <Sebah> AdvoWork is the <tr>'s id unique?
[01:58:26] <jita> Any idea why this does not work? http://jsfiddle.net/FdBKK/ ?
[02:00:23] <sahbeewah> i don't think you should have numbers as ids
[02:06:05] <sahbeewah> pflock, trying using $.trim()
[02:10:13] <pflock> sahbeewah: no, didnt work :/
[02:14:03] <sahbeewah> well data is a string so you need to change the strict !==
[02:14:10] <sahbeewah> unless you want to convert it first
[02:29:41] <pflock> sahbeewah: how do I convert it or what would be a not strict way for a !== ?
[02:30:48] <nFFF> !=
[02:33:14] <pflock> nFFF: so !== is strict and != isnt strict? Is it the same way with = and == ?
[02:33:49] <nFFF> yes to first part
[02:33:54] <nFFF> and no to second
[02:34:02] <nFFF> its the same as '===' and '=='
[02:34:16] <nFFF> Basically it's just type strictness
[02:34:32] <nFFF> === operator compares value and type, where == doesn't
[02:34:41] <nFFF> You should really always use === :<
[02:36:48] <pflock> nFFF: soooo... !== and === compare value and type, != and == dont. But its better to compare value and type?
[02:37:04] <dabear> yep
[02:37:09] <dabear> it is faster
[02:37:20] <dabear> as there is no coercion of types
[02:37:46] <xec> well, it's not faster  if the types are the same, and if the types aren't the same the result might not either
[02:37:56] <pflock> is it faster to convert the variable and use !== or to use != and dont convert?
[02:38:06] <nFFF> pflock, lets rephrase the question, is the type ambiguity a good thing?
[02:38:21] <nFFF> Its wierd in javascript how '==' isn't '===' by default
[02:38:29] <blackspotwiggins> == and != are dangerous if you don't know how they work
[02:38:32] <nFFF> why they boith exists doesnt make sense :<
[02:38:57] <pflock> yea, ok, I'll convert the string then :D
[02:39:00] <blackspotwiggins> undefined == false == 0 == ""
[02:39:01] <dabear> Sense, haven't made any since '96
[02:39:59] <dabear> 95*
[02:44:23] <jita> I want to play multiples audio files. I tried using jplayer query plugin, but it loads the player and audio file when the document loads, but i want a player where i can pass the mp3 path to the player and it will play that file in the template
[02:44:28] <jita> Is there any plugin for that ?
[02:45:17] <NET||abuse> hi guys,, i have a form element, and i need to find if a sibling of it's parent elements exist.
[02:45:23] <NET||abuse> i can't see the right method to find this.
[02:46:05] <NET||abuse> basically there are a few different positions a parent sibling element can take, it can be a <span with a class of header or a h2 with no class,
[02:46:08] <Cork> NET||abuse: closest().siblings()
[02:46:46] <nFFF> parent().siblings() ?
[02:47:23] <Cork> parent is a bit tricy though, as it only works for direct parents
[02:47:47] <NET||abuse> yeh
[02:48:48] <NET||abuse> it's a bit of a case of , the element has a wrapper, the h2 might be a sibling of that wrapper, or the wrapper might be inside another subform wrapper(fieldset or div) and a sibling of that might be a <span class="header"
[02:48:54] <NET||abuse> or there is neither, in which case
[02:49:11] <NET||abuse> i just have to attach it to either the <div class="form-wrapper" or the form itself
[02:49:24] <NET||abuse> this is for field validation incase that wasn't obvious
[02:50:13] <pflock> can anyone tell me how I can write something in#mysql?
[02:50:28] <pflock> there is something about /Identify but I dont understand that :D
[02:50:36] <nFFF> :P
[02:50:55] <mindis|wurk> you need to register your nick in freenode to talk there
[02:51:31] <pflock> -.- I gues I'll have to do that
[02:52:06] <mindis|wurk> it's not a very arduous process, you just have to remember to identify yourself every time you join the network
[02:53:08] <nFFF> Or just write a little 3 line code in mirc to do it for you
[02:53:23] <mindis|wurk> if you happen to use it that is
[02:53:31] <AdvoWork> if i have an input field, with a data attribute called data-existing_price_counter="33"  how can i get the value of the input field by that data attribute?
[02:53:44] <mindis|wurk> or rather you don't even need code for it in mirc but i guess that's getting even more offtopic ;)
[02:54:21] <nFFF> AdvoWork, attr()
[02:54:37] <pflock> I'm registered now but I still can't post :D
[02:55:06] <Cork> AdvoWork: $(this).val($(this).data('existing_price_counter))
[02:55:13] <sviatovigt> hi
[02:55:18] <Cork> AdvoWork: * $(this).val($(this).data('existing_price_counter'))
[02:56:15] <sviatovigt> I have a variable number of buttons with ids following this pattern: button-1, button-2, button-3,...,button-n
[02:56:36] <rishiket> hi, what's the difference between $(document).ready(function({})) and jQuery(document).ready(function({}))?
[02:56:40] <mindis|wurk> pflock you haven't identified (=logged in) yet
[02:57:05] <sviatovigt> how can I create a listner on each button that will trigger an action when one of the buttons is clicked
[02:57:11] <Cork> rishiket: one of them use the jQuery variable to access the jquery object and the other uses the $ one
[02:57:15] <pflock> mindis|wurk: Ye I did the Nickserv thing and now am registered somehow. I tried /Identify but that doesnt work
[02:57:16] <sviatovigt> and how can I detect which one os clicked
[02:57:18] <Cork> sviatovigt: use a class
[02:57:40] <Cork> id's need to be repeated every single one of them, so you can't make a generic selector
[02:57:44] <sviatovigt> Cork: is too much if I ask you an example?
[02:58:05] <Cork> uh <button id="button-1" class="buttons">
[02:58:12] <rishiket> Cork, what are the ways to declare the jQuery variable?
[02:58:12] <sviatovigt> ohhh
[02:58:14] <sviatovigt> ok
[02:58:20] <mindis|wurk> pflock you identify by /msg nickserv identify yourpassword
[02:58:27] <sviatovigt> and how can I detect which button was clicked?
[02:58:41] <Cork> then bind $(document).on('click', '.buttons', function() {})
[02:58:50] <Cork> the this variable will be the clicked button
[02:59:41] <Cork> rishiket: jQuery is defined when you load the script, and it sets the $ too
[03:00:00] <Cork> rishiket: other scripts can overwrite it or you can release it (.noConflict())
[03:00:00] <pflock> mindis|wurk: haha, thanks!!
[03:00:10] <mindis|wurk> np
[03:00:22] <Cork> rishiket: among other ways
[03:00:30] <Cork> rishiket: its variables just like any other
[03:00:48] <rishiket> how do I load it? I have a plain html with <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.4.2.js"></script>
[03:01:01] <Cork> ya
[03:01:03] <rishiket> the $ works here, but I can't use jQuery()
[03:01:10] <rishiket> as a variable
[03:01:14] <Cork> both would work
[03:02:06] <rishiket> I am using a hover function on document ready, it's not working if I am using jQuery(), but works if I use $
[03:02:32] <rishiket> I have set jQuery.noConflict(); also
[03:03:33] <Cork> rishiket: sounds like something is overwriting the jQuery object
[03:03:42] <Cork> and thats quite rare actually
[03:04:50] <sviatovigt> Cork: how could I get the id of the button clicked?
[03:04:59] <niels__> what's the easiest way for making a commaseparated string from the .text of let's say 10 divs? add them to an array and do join(',') ?
[03:07:16] <nFFF> niels__ .text().replace(/[ ,]+/g, ",");
[03:08:13] <rishiket> Cork, here is my piece of code: http://jsfiddle.net/XNVSZ/
[03:08:38] <rishiket> I am not using any other javascript, except loading the jquery js file
[03:09:18] <rishiket> the rest of my hmtl code is just static content
[03:10:47] <niels__> nFFF: there aren't any commas. it's something like http://pastebin.com/44TATZGz
[03:14:14] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/
[03:15:25] <rishiket> Cork, complete code at - http://jsfiddle.net/XNVSZ/1/
[03:15:26] <niels__> nFFF: that way it would append a comma to the last item, in this case sun, but i guess that doesnt really matter much
[03:15:47] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/1/
[03:18:36] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/2/
[03:19:45] <nFFF> There may be better ways of doing it, but it works :D
[03:20:05] <xec> just do .join() if you have an array
[03:22:02] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/3/
[03:22:29] <niels__> thanks, lovely ppl
[03:24:51] <nFFF> :DD
[03:24:55] <iNerd> :[
[03:27:39] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/4/ how I would do it :)

[03:29:36] <dabear> or even http://jsfiddle.net/94Q4V/5/
[03:30:11] <dabear> nFFF: you cannot compare objects with ==
[03:30:28] <dabear> you can however loop through all properties and check if they are the same
[03:40:16] <Xotix> Hi, i have a problem. The demo is very pasted and cutted code. posting everything would be too big. Using tables = newsletter so please! no comment on that. http://jsfiddle.net/TwxXU/ the elements on the right, the pic with the text, is sortable. If you dblclick on the text, an editor appears. (editable div) if you save it, you can't sort the element anymore. Why?
[03:42:29] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, you are trying to use js in a ... newsletter?
[03:42:45] <xec> my thought exactly
[03:43:04] <Xotix> No, its about creating them
[03:44:04] <xec> you are generating a static newsletter using sortable plugin...?
[03:46:06] <Xotix> xec, it is just a little isolated part. Why does it matter?  You got some library of elements. You can drag them into your newsletter, edit them, resort them etc.
[03:46:40] <xec> ah, i see, that makes sense
[03:48:02] <xec> but i don't see any images above the text "headTHIS IMG's ABOVE ARE NOT DRAGGABLE!!"
[03:49:05] <Xotix> xec :) i'll create a good demo.

[04:02:54] <robk> I have a form which has a bunch of form elements on it, but also needs to be dragged in the proper order on the same page.

[04:31:10] <kevindougans> i'm having a bit of
[04:31:19] <kevindougans> a problem trying to "explode" effect a div
[04:31:20] <kevindougans> http://jsfiddle.net/kevindougans/5zYQG/1/
[04:31:23] <kevindougans> can anyone help?
[04:31:59] <kevindougans> var liid = $('#' + $(that).attr('data-lid')).val(); // isn't working
[04:32:36] <Cork> use .data when you access data- values
[04:32:42] <Cork> makes the code simpler to read
[04:33:34] <Cork> kevindanko: and $(that) is a bit pointless its alreay a jquery object
[04:37:48] <Cork> kevindanko: and the reason the .val fails is cause you don't have any data-lid on the add new button
[04:38:02] <Cork> so the selector doens't find any element
[04:42:07] <kevindougans> Cork: it's not the "add new" button i'm using for this. i want that when you click the x it send the ajax (which works fine) then explodes the <li> so that it vanishes
[04:45:34] <Cork> kevindanko: uh... your runnin val on an li element
[04:46:19] <Cork> where do you want the value from?
[04:46:57] <kevindougans> i was hoping to store the <LI> id in the button so that i could easily access it and then hide the <Li>
[04:47:30] <Cork> sure
[04:47:43] <kevindougans> thats what i've tried to do
[04:47:46] <kevindougans> sorry if its messy
[04:47:51] <Cork> but our running $('#' that.data('liid')) followed by .val()
[04:47:51] <kevindougans> still getting to grips with jquery
[04:48:03] <Cork> that'll look for form values on the element
[04:48:13] <kevindougans> originally i had:
[04:48:17] <Cork> and li isn't a form element so val win't be meaning full
[04:48:38] <kevindougans> data-lid="l170116373916303360" <- i had this in the button
[04:48:39] <kevindougans> then
[04:48:41] <kevindougans> was trying to
[04:48:56] <kevindougans> var liid = $('#' + $(this).attr('data-lid')).val();
[04:49:04] <kevindougans> because i thought to access the data-ref
[04:49:07] <kevindougans> i had to use .val
[04:49:16] <domcat> I have an overlay image on s slideshow which I want to hide on mouseove, Im using this code http://pastie.org/3420135, the problem is that when I click to next slide it has the overlay again - but it should be gone for all slides, any ideas how to accomplis that?
[04:49:18] <Cork> your looking for the "Approve" button?
[04:49:29] <kevindougans> the "x" button actually
[04:49:34] <kevindougans> thats the one i want to delete the tweet
[04:49:46] <Cork> and why not just get that from that?
[04:49:53] <Cork> it is the x button if you click it
[04:50:12] <kevindougans> yeh so when you click the x i want to hide the parent <li>
[04:50:27] <kevindougans> not sure from click the x how i tell it to hide the whole <li>
[04:50:40] <Cork> so that.closest('li').hide() ?
[04:50:43] <kevindougans> i know how to hide the "x" if you click the x but i want it to "hide" the whole row
[04:50:58] <kevindougans> closest????
[04:50:59] <kevindougans> never heard of it

[04:51:16] <kevindougans> god i love jquery
[04:51:20] <Cork> as in match the closest parent
[04:51:37] <Cork> it doesn't match based on position or things like that
[04:51:45] <Cork> and it doesn't match siblings or children
[04:51:47] <Cork> only parents
[05:01:06] <nFFF> Cork whats the difference between parent and closest
[05:01:09] <nFFF> and which is fastest?
[05:01:10] <juria_roberts> for a submit button how do I get which form element its attached to?
[05:01:28] <Cork> nFFF: parent does dom.parent
[05:01:38] <Cork> so it only looks statically on the direct parent
[05:02:09] <Cork> closest is a selector, it looks up the parent tree trying to find one that matches your selector
[05:02:40] <Cork> nFFF: when its about speed, parent is faster, though it rarly matters cause the difference is so small
[05:03:22] <nFFF> in your case: that.closest('li').hide()
[05:03:39] <nFFF> is there any difference between that and that.parent('li').hide()
[05:03:48] <Cork> yes
[05:03:55] <nFFF> Do they both not find the first closest parent li?
[05:04:05] <Cork> parent('li') returns the current elements parent if it is an li
[05:04:11] <Cork> if the direct parent isn't an li element
[05:04:14] <Cork> it returns nothing
[05:04:15] <nFFF> Ah ok
[05:04:41] <pflock> if I call a php script via $.post, and I have 2 different echos in the PHP script, eg echo 1 and echo 2. Will data just be 12 or is there a way to seperate the original echos?
[05:04:45] <Cork> so closest is most of the time what you want
[05:04:52] <nFFF> Yep
[05:05:13] <Cork> pflock: its just a stream of data
[05:05:15] <nFFF> Youd think it could be named better :D
[05:05:26] <Cork> pflock: you can split them by row, or use something like json
[05:05:38] <Cork> data.split('\n')
[05:06:09] <Cork> nFFF: parent is named after the dom conterpart
[05:06:31] <nFFF> Im thinkign closest
[05:06:32] <Cork> its just a function that let you access the dom pointer from jquery objects
[05:06:46] <nFFF> implies closest element child sinbling or parent
[05:06:48] <Cork> i find it farly descriptive
[05:07:18] <nFFF> parent() makes sense for direct parent, closest should be somehting like parentAll
[05:07:42] <xec> there is already a .parents() that does what i would expect a parentAll to do
[05:07:50] <xec> .. get all the parents
[05:08:12] <nFFF> yea perhaps i literally thought of that on the spot
[05:08:13] <Cork> ya, and many that use parents actually wants closest again
[05:08:19] <nFFF> the point is closest could be named bette
[05:08:22] <xec> i guess .closestParent() would be more descriptive
[05:08:26] <nFFF> yes
[05:08:34] <nFFF> closest implies any relationship just simply closest
[05:08:47] <Cork> it would be a bit mouth full though
[05:08:51] <nFFF> which I thought it did when I first encountered it
[05:09:02] <nFFF> I thought it simply return the closest matched element regardless of relationship
[05:09:12] <xec> well, now you know
[05:09:17] <xec> :)
[05:09:29] <juria_roberts> for a submit button how do I get which form element its attached to?
[05:09:53] <erichynds> juria_roberts: use the "form" property of the submit button node
[05:09:54] <Cork> juria_roberts: why do you need to?
[05:09:54] <bot-t> (62 hours 4 mins ago) <nimbu> tell erichynds this ram ad anifinitum is hilarious.
[05:10:01] <Cork> just bind the submit to the form
[05:10:27] <juria_roberts> erichynds: $('#srch_bx_sbmt').attr('form') comes as undefined
[05:10:54] <erichynds> juria_roberts: $("#srch_bx_sbmt").prop("form")
[05:11:53] <juria_roberts> erichynds: thanks
[05:11:53] <pflock_> can I pass multiple or multidimensional arrays through JSON?
[05:12:02] <Cork> sure
[05:12:24] <juria_roberts> erichynds: how do i get to see all the properties?
[05:12:30] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
[05:12:33] <bot-t> Cork: "[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]"
[05:12:44] <erichynds> juria_roberts: you'll need to console.log() the DOM element and use webkit inspector/firebug to inspect it
[05:12:47] <erichynds> and see what's there
[05:13:02] <juria_roberts> erichynds: ok
[05:14:57] <pflock_> Cork: Thanks ;)
[05:17:50] <who_are_you> hello
[05:18:15] <who_are_you> I am using .animate on a div; I want it to change width, and also remove paddings
[05:18:33] <who_are_you> but while it animates width change nicely, paddings are set immediately
[05:21:10] <alaing> Hi I'm having difficulties with jQuery UI DatePickers. I have $('.mydates').datepicker(). When I inspect the DOM I can see a "hasDatepicker" class has been added which suggests that datepicker has been applied but when the field has focus no calendar appears. Any ideas?
[05:21:40] <kevindougans> hey cork: thanks for earlier if i didn't say it already
[05:21:40] <who_are_you> nevermind, it turns out you have to use individual properties ("padding-left" instead of "padding", etc.)
[05:21:59] <Cork> kevindougans: np :)
[05:22:57] <Cork> who_are_you: ya, you can't use shorthands in animate
[05:27:24] <alaing> Hi I'm having difficulties with jQuery UI DatePickers. I have $('.mydates').datepicker(). When I inspect the DOM I can see a "hasDatepicker" class has been added which suggests that datepicker has been applied but when the field has focus no calendar appears. Any ideas?
[05:28:52] <poppiez> hi, can't jquery/browsers handle a HTTP status code of 204 in AJAX requests? my response is blank
[05:34:58] <who_are_you> Ok, now for another problem. I'm using .resizable on an object, with only 's' handle. Thing is, I don't want it to create handle...only to accept mine, which is completely different div
[05:35:25] <who_are_you> let me jsfiddle that :)
[05:35:58] <who_are_you> definitely jsfiddle that, as there's more involved too
[05:36:34] <Haraldson> any idea why my animations won't run at all when given the queue parameter (string)?
[05:37:38] <JCBK> could some take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/hNHmk/3/ and tell me why the delay doesn't work? :)
[05:39:21] <tuxie__> Hi. I am trying to serialize a form. Problem is, the checkbox value when its checked is not used, it just sends an empty string if its checked.
[05:40:04] <tuxie__> That is, if i don't check the checkbox, no value for the checkbox is returned. If i do check the checkbox, the name of the checkbox is returned, but with an empty value.
[05:41:50] <Mako_> guys I need to find first element from  selector  - some element starting with X -> http://jsfiddle.net/JT9Te/7/
[05:43:06] <tuxie__> The only thing i find about it on google is that jquery leaves unchecked checkboxes, but thats alright. I just want it to be filled with.. well. Anything.
[05:43:27] <angelazou> hello, I'm having a problem getting a piece of jquery to work
[05:43:39] <angelazou> it seems like it works fine in the jsfiddle demo
[05:43:50] <angelazou> but the exact same code doesn't work on my site
[05:43:57] <who_are_you> http://jsfiddle.net/dLa4S/
[05:44:08] <angelazou> This is happening to http://wanda.centilin.com/category/Âè∞Ê±ü‰∏áËææ/ÁÉ≠ÂçñÂïÜÂüé/# page
[05:44:32] <angelazou> where you are suppose to click the link next to [get_loc], and it will open a dropdown meanu
[05:44:37] <angelazou> menu I mean
[05:46:17] <angelazou> can someone tell me why the snippet is not running?
[05:46:32] <angelazou> I checked with firebug, there are a few errors, but it's not relevant to the snippet
[05:48:48] <angelazou> anyone?
[05:49:30] <Cork> angelazou: if code doesn't parse, other parts might not run
[05:49:55] <angelazou> what can cause the code to not parse? Cork?
[05:50:10] <Cork> angelazou: syntax errors most of the time
[05:50:18] <Cork> your error console should tell you
[05:50:50] <Cork> angelazou: my point was mainly that just cause the line isn't the one you have problem with, doesn't mean its not related
[05:51:29] <tuxie__> Can't reproduce :/
[05:54:34] <angelazou> actually, Safari told me about an error with the script, I pasted it here (on line 10) http://jsfiddle.net/5UwwE/
[05:54:53] <angelazou> however, I don't understand why there is an error, it looks perfectly fine to me
[05:55:07] <angelazou> Firefox said there is an illegal character on that line
[05:57:39] <Cork> angelazou: whats the first line?
[05:57:50] <angelazou> of the javascript? or the error message?
[05:58:09] <angelazou> I pasted the entire snippet
[05:58:17] <who_are_you> hmm...maybe another way
[05:58:27] <Cork> ah, no sorry thought your html was something else
[05:58:28] <Cork> :)
[05:58:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5UwwE/1/ works here

[06:17:50] <dangerousdave> in prototype i would do $('image').setAttribute("src",path), what would that look like in jquery please?

[06:19:41] <poppiez> why does the jquery success callback fire when a http status code 204 is returned? wouldn't that give an error?
[06:19:58] <dangerousdave> jomofcw: thanks
[06:20:02] <jomofcw> erdos imgs.each(function())
[06:20:23] <Cork> poppiez: 200 is a success call
[06:20:32] <erdos> jomofcw: thanks! i didn't realise you could do it like that
[06:20:35] <jomofcw> poppiez a request is a success if the server answer something imo.
[06:20:38] <Cork> poppiez: or rather 2xx is success status
[06:20:48] <Cork> jomofcw: its not
[06:20:56] <jomofcw> erdos jquery.each is for collection other than a jQuery object.
[06:21:18] <jomofcw> Cork OK ^^
[06:21:23] <Cork> 2xx is success, 3xx is redirect, 4xx is client error and 5xx is server error
[06:21:26] <erdos> jomofcw: ah ok, so in that function how do i refer to each single object?

[06:22:00] <jomofcw> erdos : this yea. Don't forget to do $(this) to get the jQuery thing.
[06:22:02] <poppiez> Cork: ah, ok. thx a lot!
[06:22:05] <Cork> jomofcw: you have only one radio button in the li?

[06:30:10] <Cork> pflock_: through the success callback
[06:30:19] <Cork> its first parameter is the data
[06:30:44] <pflock_> Cork: So data is the json-string?
[06:30:50] <pflock_> Cork: Or an Object?
[06:30:53] <Cork> no its a javascript object
[06:31:10] <Syco54645_work> Cork: that worked, thanks
[06:31:27] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"this":"is what you get"}')
[06:31:29] <bot-t> Cork: {"this": "is what you get"}
[06:31:41] <Cork> so no its not json
[06:31:48] <jomofcw> Cork it crash probably because it create a loop :/.
[06:32:36] <Cork> jomofcw: ha, ya you have to stop the bubbeling event on the option element
[06:32:46] <pflock_> Cork: ye and where is the string '{"this":"is what you get"}' saved?
[06:32:59] <Cork> else you will have li click > radio click > bubble > li click > start over
[06:33:05] <sviatovigt> Cork: that is not working
[06:33:12] <Cork> pflock_: its not, you get the parsed value
[06:33:53] <Cork> ?eval 'button-12'.match(/[0-9]+$/)[0] @ sviatovigt
[06:33:54] <bot-t> sviatovigt: "12"

[06:34:57] <jomofcw> It works ! Thanks Cork !
[06:35:18] <Cork> pflock_: as i said, the first argument to the success function
[06:35:41] <crem> Wow so many brettsters.

[06:36:05] <Cork> crem: and soon its prob going to start spaming
[06:42:34] <angelazou> I'm having a little trouble getting this script to run http://jsfiddle.net/gKT8R/
[06:42:51] <angelazou> when I checked it a couple of days ago, it was working fine
[06:43:00] <angelazou> Not sure what's wrong here
[06:43:08] <angelazou> inputs are appreciated
[06:44:10] <johnkpaul> angelazou: what is the problem you're observing
[06:44:10] <bigkevmcd> angelazou: "$(#field_9n6ljw)." <- should that not have quotes round it?
[06:44:30] <angelazou> well, it's suppose to update
[06:44:38] <angelazou> this is a simple calculation snippet
[06:44:47] <angelazou> right now I'm setting price to be fixed
[06:44:59] <johnkpaul>  $(#field_9n6ljw) is invalid syntax
[06:45:06] <angelazou> i want the total price which is quantity * unit price
[06:45:07] <johnkpaul> you need to put quotes around the string
[06:45:32] <johnkpaul> now it's working for me
[06:45:45] <johnkpaul> just bear in mind that the "change" event is only fired after blur
[06:46:20] <angelazou> I added, the quote, but still nothing changes...
[06:46:29] <angelazou> how did you get it work johnkpaul?
[06:46:41] <johnkpaul> you need two quotes angelazou
[06:46:50] <johnkpaul> one before # and one after the 'w'
[06:46:55] <angelazou> oh, I see it now, have to leave for the data to update
[06:47:15] <angelazou> is it possible to update it without clicking elsewhere?
[06:49:07] <angelazou> also, how can I get that total to round to 2 digits, already tried toFixed
[06:49:12] <angelazou> see this paste http://jsfiddle.net/gKT8R/2/
[06:49:35] <johnkpaul> thats what I meant when the change event only hapens after blur
[06:49:52] <johnkpaul> angelazou: you migth want to try keyup instead of change
[06:50:10] <johnkpaul> also, Math.round
[06:50:13] <johnkpaul> is how you round
[06:51:26] <johnkpaul> although, that's interesting, I don't know what the difference between toFixed and round is
[06:51:45] <angelazou> okay, one last thing, can I rewrite the value like this?                 $("#total_price").val('¬•' + total);
[06:51:57] <angelazou> I need to keep that yen sign
[06:52:13] <johnkpaul> :) why don't you try it and let me know how it goes
[06:52:40] <dangerousdave> how can i achieve this prototype code in jquery please? height = document.viewport.getDimensions().height;
[06:53:05] <johnkpaul> angelazou: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/566564/javascript-functions-math-round0-vs-tofixed0-and-browser-inconsistencies might be interesting to you
[06:53:13] <johnkpaul> dangerousdave: "prototype code"?
[06:53:14] <similian> cheers folks
[06:53:42] * chee rs folks
[06:53:42] <similian> how can I delayDefault for links and inputs in general?
[06:53:53] <dangerousdave> johnkpaul: yeah, prototype http://www.prototypejs.org/
[06:54:10] <Seubeu> Hi all, a simple question I think : I have a <select> with a $('#MySelect').change(function()) listener. How do I trigger my function on load AND on change ?
[06:54:12] <johnkpaul> oh :) prototype is an overloaded word in the js community
[06:54:23] <dangerousdave> johnkpaul: sorry
[06:54:40] <DukeDrake> hi
[06:54:50] <Seubeu> except using .trigger :p
[06:54:59] <similian> how can I call Default after having it delayed some time before?
[06:55:03] <Cork> Seubeu: in your onload event do  $('#MySelect').change();
[06:55:31] <johnkpaul> dangerousdave: I'm pretty sure that $(window).height() and width() give you the viewport dimensions
[06:55:48] <dangerousdave> johnkpaul: thanks!
[06:56:16] <johnkpaul> similian: what do you mean "call default"?
[06:56:26] <johnkpaul> or rather, what is default
[06:56:37] <Seubeu> thanks Cork that was obvious ;)
[06:58:42] <johnkpaul> dangerousdave: no problem, have fun
[06:59:23] <angelazou> hey johnkpaul, round seem to go either up or down, but doesn't give me the decimal points, I decided to remain with tofixed
[06:59:38] <angelazou> however, I keep getting the undefined function error on the total.tofixed() line
[06:59:43] <angelazou> any idea how that happened?
[07:00:06] <johnkpaul> I dont' remember your code completely, but my guess is that you're calling toFixed on a string rather than an int
[07:01:06] <angelazou> I forgot, here is the paste http://jsfiddle.net/gKT8R/3/
[07:01:20] <JonathanCutrell> Hello hello folks.
[07:01:20] <angelazou> but I converted it to a float already, with parsefloat
[07:02:40] <Eviltwin> angelazou: toFixed !== tofixed
[07:02:54] <angelazou> ah, thanks Eviltwin
[07:02:59] <Eviltwin> Just like parseFloat !== parsefloat
[07:03:40] <angelazou> and if I want to append something to the text, can I do it like this?  $("#total_price").val('¬•' + total);
[07:04:11] <angelazou> for some really weird reason, toFixed isn't working
[07:04:27] <Eviltwin> ?eval (3.14159).toFixed(2)
[07:04:27] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "3.14"
[07:04:31] <angelazou> if I get the quantity set to 3 or 6, it gives me a really long line of 0
[07:04:54] <angelazou> hmm...
[07:05:38] * faithlove is away (Gone fishing!)
[07:05:43] <Eviltwin> You apparently don't understand how toFixed works
[07:05:48] <Eviltwin> It doesn't modify the number
[07:05:58] <Eviltwin> It produces a string with that fixed number of 0's
[07:06:25] <Xotix> How can i clean up incoming input which gets pasted?
[07:06:32] <Xotix> *was
[07:06:46] <angelazou> so are you saying I should output the string instead of the number, right?
[07:06:54] <Eviltwin> Uh...yeah
[07:07:10] <angelazou> ha, got it working
[07:07:54] <angelazou> one last thing, I asked earlier about another snippet here http://jsfiddle.net/5UwwE/
[07:08:02] <angelazou> this one is working in JSfiddle
[07:08:24] <angelazou> but when I put it in my site (an exact replica), I got errors from firefox and safari
[07:08:43] <niels__> I'm trying to get this AJAX form to work. And it does, if I use a simple text string as the parameter, but i can't use the string i made from array.join(). could anyone have a look? http://pastebin.com/EVLY9m67
[07:08:54] <angelazou> they say that there is a parse error with the last }); but I'm totally confused
[07:09:35] <angelazou> should I or should I not add a semicolon at the end of a function?
[07:09:38] <JonathanCutrell> niels__: I'll look.
[07:11:13] <niels__> JonathanCutrell: thanks alot
[07:12:06] <JonathanCutrell> niels__: weird. Doesn't look like there's a js error...
[07:13:20] <niels__> it's really weird.. thought maybe i'd missed a tiny bit, but.. i can't figure it out for the life of me
[07:14:46] <JonathanCutrell> niels__: it does work when you substitute a string, you say?
[07:15:03] <niels__> yes
[07:15:17] <JonathanCutrell> niels__: and when you console.log out the other, it is a string?
[07:17:16] <niels__> JonathanCutrell: good question, not sure
[07:19:14] <niels__> JonathanCutrell: console.log(jQuery.type(string)); outputs string
[07:19:45] <JonathanCutrell> try adding a "complete" function as well, and see what data it passes.
[07:21:47] <who_are_you> is there a way to "overlay" an image over a div, without making content in div, well, unusable?
[07:21:55] <who_are_you> let me show you
[07:22:03] <niels__> JonathanCutrell: i can alert(string) in the complete function perfectly fine
[07:22:53] <nFFF> niels__, does the string contain invalid characters perhap
[07:23:07] <niels__> nFFF: not at all, tripple checked
[07:23:23] <pflock_> my js just started working somehow. If I enter all my code to JSFiddle it works fine there, but on my laptop suddenly all JS/Jquery things aren't working in all my browsers....any idea's what happened?
[07:25:39] <who_are_you> http://jsfiddle.net/28jY5/
[07:25:49] <who_are_you> I'd like to still be able to select "SOME TEXT", etc.
[07:26:53] <ralphholzmann> who_are_you: you can add "pointer-events: none;" to the #over element style
[07:26:59] <ralphholzmann> but that'll only work in newer browsers
[07:27:02] <ralphholzmann> def not IE
[07:27:19] <ralphholzmann> http://jsfiddle.net/28jY5/1/
[07:28:48] <who_are_you> ralphholzmann: I have to get it working in IE7...damn
[07:29:22] <who_are_you> basically idea is, I need to create image over a div
[07:29:30] <who_are_you> .png, half-transparent
[07:29:50] <who_are_you> without touching interactions with this div
[07:32:50] <ralphholzmann> right
[07:33:05] <ralphholzmann> sounds hacky, but you could put a second, duplicate div in front
[07:33:12] <ralphholzmann> with "color: transparent"
[07:36:02] <diverdude> if i have var a =[1 4 5 6]; how do i remove element value = 4, so that i have array a = [1 5 6] left?
[07:37:05] <K3|Chris> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3680429/click-through-a-div-to-underlying-elements <--
[07:37:07] <niels__> nFFF & JonathanCutrell: I had a form validation of max 64 chars. just spend 2 hours figuring that out. no biggie.
[07:37:24] <Guest23550> diverdude: Easy! make a new array
[07:37:40] <diverdude> Guest23550: that sounds like a horrible idea
[07:38:37] <who_are_you> ralphholzmann: that's on CMS, cloning divs is a bad idea...
[07:38:45] <who_are_you> anyway, I think I found a solution.
[07:38:55] <who_are_you> It's even more hacky but well, what isn't?
[07:41:29] <shisma> hi
[07:42:02] <shisma> did you ever wonder how to align stuff vertically without js?
[07:42:18] <who_are_you> shisma: css?
[07:42:35] <shisma> with css
[07:42:36] <shisma> yes
[07:42:49] <who_are_you> not too hard, thought a bit hacky
[07:43:00] <Xotix> valign or something like that?
[07:43:10] <shisma> i think i've found a way wich is not hacky
[07:43:19] <who_are_you> oops we're thinking of another ways :)
[07:43:31] <shisma> http://geeks.yannickoo.de/sites/geeks.yannickoo.de/files/attachments/vertical-aligned-page.html
[07:45:00] <Xotix> I have an ajax img upload created with jquery.forms. On ie i get access denied, why?
[07:45:26] <dangerousdave> can you bind a function in jquery like this? $('#overlay').click = hideLightBox;
[07:45:45] <dangerousdave> above is prototype code (doesn't work for jquery.
[07:50:00] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ dangerousdave
[07:50:02] <bot-t> dangerousdave, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[07:50:19] <aaronmcadam> you'd pass into the func
[07:50:23] <AdvoWork> i'm using ajax to send post information to a .php file. http://pastebin.com/L2Ukzw0g  its only very basic, to_passdata has the data, but the php file doesn't seem to get it. Any ideas please?
[07:50:29] <aaronmcadam> $('#overlay').click( hideLightBox );
[07:50:43] <aaronmcadam> but sometimes that triggers the handler
[07:50:43] <who_are_you> what's the way to obtain absolute position of corner of a div?
[07:50:52] <aaronmcadam> which corner
[07:51:11] <aaronmcadam> scrollLeft, scrollTop
[07:52:06] <who_are_you> let's say upper right
[07:52:22] <aaronmcadam> css('right')
[07:52:24] <dangerousdave> aaronmcadam: reading, thanks for help
[07:52:28] <aaronmcadam> np
[07:52:44] <who_are_you> aaronmcadam: silly me, of course
[07:53:10] <aaronmcadam> var rightCoords = [ $.fn.css('top'), $.fn.css('right') ]
[07:53:16] <fof> for anyone interested, this started today: http://www.saas-class.org/
[07:54:01] <who_are_you> ok...
[07:54:10] <who_are_you> aaronmcadam: it returns auto
[07:54:14] <who_are_you> which doesn't help much :p
[07:54:17] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:54:23] <Aamir> who_are_you: or yourDiv.position().top :|
[07:54:28] <aaronmcadam> that's the one
[07:55:08] <Aamir> if relative to document (and not its parent) than yourdiv.offset().top
[07:55:11] <Aamir> ?nice

[07:57:13] <pflock> My Javascript just stopped working. Website completly working when entered by JSFiddle. Someone knows what could be the problem?
[07:57:24] <aaronmcadam> hahah wow
[07:57:47] <aaronmcadam> ?doesn't work
[07:57:48] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[07:58:32] <who_are_you> Aamir: maybe you know some quick way of making sure it's always right, i.e. after resizing of browser window?
[07:59:03] <pflock> bot-t: No no error message or something. Just as if I would have JS turned of in all my browsers, just all javascript functions of the website won't work. But if I just copy my whole code to JSFiddle it works, and I just don't have any idea what would be the problem

[08:06:02] <aaronmcadam> DukeDrake: { "response": [{"page1": "2323"},{"page23": ""}] }
[08:06:11] <K3|Chris> I sure hope so
[08:06:14] <DukeDrake> aaronmcadam: ah ... thanx!
[08:06:15] <K3|Chris> but even so...
[08:06:18] <aaronmcadam> yip
[08:06:28] <aaronmcadam> put that thru jsonlint

[08:06:53] <K3|Chris> "reverse is faster!"
[08:07:17] <pflock> can anyone look over this: ( http://pastie.org/3421268 ) and maybe find the mistake why nothing in the script works (just as if JS is turned of in the browser, the website hasn't any JS functions anymore)
[08:07:34] <DukeDrake> aaronmcadam: valid =)
[08:07:37] <aaronmcadam> yip
[08:15:15] <aaronmcadam> pflock: run ur code thru jshint
[08:16:01] <iNerd> Aaagh. I am going mad.
[08:16:10] <aaronmcadam> the sign of web dev
[08:16:20] <iNerd> I have a script to resize a div that sometimes, only sometimes, fails to resize.
[08:16:34] <iNerd> so you load it and it'll be fine. then you do it again and it isn't until you resize.
[08:16:44] <iNerd> And I cannot for the life of me work out why.
[08:17:54] <iNerd> Other than 	jQuery.event.add(window, "load", resizeFrame);
[08:17:54] <iNerd> 	jQuery.event.add(window, "resize", resizeFrame);
[08:18:04] <iNerd> there's not more one can do to make somethnig load is there?
[08:19:04] <pifantastic> iNerd: use $(document).ready()
[08:19:22] <pifantastic> iNerd: is it possible that the JS is executing before that element exists?
[08:20:49] <pflock> aaronmcadam: thanks, thats a great tool, didnt know about it. but didn't help me either.. what does it mean with Missing "use strict" statement? ( Diskarray = new Array )
[08:21:04] <iNerd> That's what i'm wondering pif
[08:21:15] <iNerd> it's in a doc ready
[08:21:25] <dangerousdave> I have this prototype code: 	$('box').style.top = (height/2) - parseInt($('box').getHeight())/2 + "px";   and am trying to convert to jquery. is there a jquery equivalent to "parseInt"?
[08:21:45] <iNerd> though the div should be there at load, though the content is being added by another script
[08:21:57] <aaronmcadam> pflock: sets whether u want ECMA.next
[08:22:12] <aaronmcadam> no need for new Array, use literals
[08:22:17] <dangerousdave> I see there is, but is there a better way to achieve this in jquery?
[08:22:24] <aaronmcadam> lol
[08:22:32] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs @ dangerousdave
[08:22:32] <bot-t> dangerousdave, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[08:22:44] <aaronmcadam> parseInt is js fooool :D
[08:23:11] <dangerousdave> aaronmcadam: doh, thanks, feel silly now
[08:23:26] <khmer> you know that's kinda needlessly dismissive isn't it
[08:23:33] <aaronmcadam> to get those properties, u need to get the DOM element from the jq selection
[08:23:42] <khmer> there are convenience functions in jquery for all sorts of things
[08:23:42] <aaronmcadam> with $('.box')[0]
[08:24:49] <aaronmcadam> khmer maybe, but then people end up using $.fn.size() instead of native properties like `length`
[08:24:51] <iNerd> someone's got a good connection :p
[08:25:05] <dangerousdave> aaronmcadam: ta
[08:25:10] <aaronmcadam> np
[08:25:35] <khmer> aaronmcadam: yes, it's better to go native for small things, but that thing treats people like idiots for thinking something that jquery already encourages--that existing JS patterns are usefully abstracted in jquery
[08:26:38] <khmer> we have .size() when .length will do, and .isArray when Object.prototype.toString.call(this).indexOf('Array') != -1
[08:26:41] <khmer> would work fine
[08:26:47] <khmer> but someone asks if there's a parseInt and we're like
[08:26:55] <khmer> DOY, you NOOB
[08:26:57] <Sebah> i have three div's on my page with the class 'w-align-left', 'w-align-center' & 'w-align-right'. Can I select all three of them at the same time ( something like $('.w-align' + *) )?
[08:27:00] <aaronmcadam> it's important to know the difference
[08:27:08] <khmer> it's important to not be twelve-year-olds
[08:28:05] <khmer> you're lucky dangerousdave is nicer than you and i are

[08:34:23] <Onkeltem> What is alternative to then 'on' method of jQuery 1.7 in jQuery 1.5?
[08:34:39] <rocky> what's the most common way for consuming restful+json based services with jquery? is there a jquery plugin that will wrap a restful service like this and provide an easy api to use?
[08:35:35] <gehsekky> Onkeltem: bind, live, or delegate
[08:36:30] <brianloveswords> gehsekky: none of the above -- use "on".
[08:36:38] <Onkeltem> gehsekky: so I can freely replace `on` with `bind` w/o consequences?
[08:36:59] <brianloveswords> ahhh 1.5, didn't see that.
[08:37:07] <Onkeltem> I have some code with 'on' and need to convert it to 1.5
[08:37:12] <Onkeltem> Please, help
[08:37:12] <brianloveswords> Onkeltem: the best replacement would be delegate.
[08:37:14] <iNerd> Huurk. How can I get a script to wait until another script has loaded an image -_-
[08:37:41] <brianloveswords> Onkeltem: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:37:45] <gehsekky> brianloveswords: i thought jq 1.7 was using bind/live/delegate as one line wrappers for on?
[08:38:02] <gehsekky> but you're saying none of them use on?
[08:38:02] <brianloveswords> gehsekky: Internally it is.
[08:38:04] <ajpiano> Onkeltem: the best thing to do would be to not touch the existing .on code and duckpunch it into your 1.5 install
[08:38:12] <gehsekky> brianloveswords: then why would you say that?
[08:38:46] <ajpiano> $.fn.on = function( event, selector, handler ) {  return this.delegate( selector, event, handler );   };
[08:39:07] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: thumbs up!
[08:39:17] <gehsekky> so really, everything is a wrapper for delegate?
[08:39:28] <ajpiano> in 1.7, everything is a wrapper for .on
[08:39:38] <gehsekky> ahh ok. that's what i thought
[08:46:34] * chee is a wrapper for .on
[08:46:49] <iNerd> Hum. what am i doing wrong.
[08:46:52] <iNerd> http://jsfiddle.net/UregA/
[08:49:59] <nFFF> iNerd, there's no html :<<
[08:50:25] <iNerd> indeed, trying to extracate it is hard.
[08:50:33] <iNerd> it's part of a wordpress thing.
[08:51:59] <warrenparsons> iNerd: Why are you using jQuery.event.add() rather than $(window).on('load', resizeFrame)?
[08:52:11] <nFFF> ^^
[08:52:44] <iNerd> I'm piecing this together from googles, so there's no very good reason.
[08:53:00] <nFFF> I think you only do that for a custom events
[08:53:04] <nFFF> but load is native
[08:53:18] <faithlove> hi guys! i've found a free jQuery video tutorials series. can i post the link here ? :)
[08:54:07] <warrenparsons> iNerd: I strongly suggest spending some quality time with http://api.jquery.com/ before writing much more code. Attaching a standard event is pretty fundamental stuff.
[08:55:01] <nFFF> ?resize @ iNerd
[08:55:02] <bot-t> iNerd, .resize(handler): Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[08:55:06] <iNerd> Arr. :/ just trying to get this to work so I can forget about it >_<
[08:55:13] <nFFF> ?load @ iNerd
[08:55:13] <bot-t> iNerd, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:56:28] * faithlove for newbies: http://learnjquery.tutsplus.com/
[08:56:36] <warrenparsons> I prefer the one-model-to-rule-them-all .on() vs. the convenience methods. But I suppose if someone's trying to "forget about it" it doesn't matter. *sigh*
[08:57:38] <iNerd> I'm not really in a position to spend months lerning jquery sadly.
[08:58:35] <faithlove> iNerd: each tutorial is in average 15mins long. you have video examples, sourcecodes and a forum. all of this is free :)
[08:58:48] <faithlove> and the guy explains everything very clearly
[08:58:56] <warrenparsons> iNerd: You don't need to spend months all at once. But spending a couple hours reading up on the basics can help tremendously. Use of jQuery.event.add() in this situation tells me you need better sources for your information. Hence the http://api.jquery.com/ mention.
[08:59:23] <ajpiano> jQuery.event.add isn't a user-facing API.
[09:00:41] <iNerd> I've been trying to google to fix a problem. that's what it threw it at me.
[09:01:53] <ajpiano> iNerd: if you aren't willing to spend at least a few hours looking over the docs and other materials, you'll be setting yourself up for several months of ineffectual flailing about and blaming google for your problems
[09:02:44] * warrenparsons blames Google for all his problems.
[09:04:02] <iNerd> No. I don't blame google. I was merely trying to use it to see if someone else had had and also solved this already.
[09:04:35] <warrenparsons> iNerd: Did the use of .on() that I demonstrated earlier make sense to you?
[09:04:55] <faithlove> my dad always said: if you don't know how to use a tool, why don't you learn? :)
[09:06:03] <faithlove> dude, just follow that tutorial. it's really great... seriously
[09:06:40] <iNerd> I intend to, just not all of it this instant
[09:07:00] <faithlove> yeah, well just look at what you're interested in :)
[09:08:55] * faithlove is away (Gone fishing!)

[09:18:27] <Sebah> iNerd: don't mind nsfw, but not know. I'm at work :)
[09:18:29] <SirCmpwn> the error function, however, is called, and only shows "error"
[09:18:43] <iNerd> and if I'm boing horribly annoying I do apologise it's not at all intentional
[09:22:33] <drakythe> If i'm using an if statement examining the value of a checkbox, what am I comparied, 1/0 or the value of the checkbox?
[09:22:43] <nickelnick> yo adam you out there buddy?
[09:24:35] <anoob> i would like to stop subsequent events: http://pastebin.com/gLBt40M8
[09:25:08] <Eviltwin> How do you stop something from firing an event?
[09:25:25] <Eviltwin> Is that the question?
[09:27:53] <anoob> sorry: http://pastebin.com/gLBt40M8
[09:28:19] <Eviltwin> Okay, why?
[09:28:32] <anoob> Eviltwin, $('#price-slider').slider("option", { step: 1000, max: 50000, values: [0, 25000]}); will fire an event
[09:28:37] <anoob> I would like to stop it
[09:28:42] <Eviltwin> Okay, why
[09:28:43] <anoob> prevent it
[09:28:47] <Eviltwin> Okay, why?
[09:29:01] <anoob> I don't need to fire it now
[09:29:11] <Eviltwin> What event?
[09:29:40] <anoob> sliderchange
[09:29:42] <LordThumper> Hi there. When initializing a jQuery plugin with objects, is it possible to initialise with an object's key/value pair? Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dKDF8/
[09:29:43] <anoob> it will fire
[09:29:51] <Eviltwin> And why is that a problem?
[09:30:07] <LordThumper> a jQuery plugin with options*
[09:32:11] <LordThumper> Can I do something like $("div").fancybox(object) ?
[09:32:47] <Eviltwin> Well I don't know if fancybox does anything with the "border" or "padding" keys
[09:33:01] <Eviltwin> But yeah, you can use that instead of the { "key": "value", ... } syntax
[09:33:33] <LordThumper> Ah awesome, thanks Eviltwin
[09:33:37] <Eviltwin> BTW: http://jsfiddle.net/dKDF8/1/
[09:34:11] <LordThumper> Awesome :)
[09:34:12] <LordThumper> tyvm
[09:34:34] <drakythe> Anyone feel like helping a newbie with evaluating a checkbox status? http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/TKGgD/7/
[09:34:58] <nickelnick> what about it
[09:35:19] <nickelnick> $('#checkbox').val()
[09:35:22] <drakythe> I need to trigger a .show if its checked
[09:35:39] <drakythe> and I'm such a newb the process I would use to do this is escaping me
[09:35:52] <Chopps> hey guys, i want to have a load gif and then fade out the gif and fade in my content, i have this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/2CpqW/ can anyone tell me why its not working please??
[09:36:15] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ Chopps
[09:36:15] <drakythe> alright, so what is the val() of a checkbox? is it true/false 1/0 or the value assigned in the html?
[09:36:15] <bot-t> Chopps, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[09:36:44] <nickelnick> yea  1 0 i believe
[09:36:52] <nickelnick> you could do like...
[09:37:46] <nickelnick> $('#checkbox').live('click' function(){ do something });
[09:37:54] <Eviltwin> No
[09:37:58] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[09:37:59] <Eviltwin> Ever
[09:38:01] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[09:38:02] <nickelnick> oh yea lol
[09:38:04] <nickelnick> i forgot about that
[09:38:13] <Eviltwin> If you need .live's behavior, use .delegate or .on
[09:38:18] <drakythe> alright, .change then?
[09:38:43] <nickelnick> cant you make the var avail after dom
[09:39:08] <SirCmpwn> For this code, the callback isn't run, the post is made, and the error is "error": http://pastebin.com/wvNrmcMY
[09:40:05] <Eviltwin> ?g Same-Origin Policy @ SirCmpwn
[09:40:06] <bot-t> SirCmpwn, Same origin policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[09:40:10] <Eviltwin> Are you violating that?
[09:40:34] <SirCmpwn> no
[09:40:51] <SirCmpwn> oh, wait, different subdomain
[09:40:52] <SirCmpwn> so yes
[09:41:05] <SirCmpwn> but the post is made
[09:43:23] <Chopps> ive read that already Eviltwin, i wasnt able to find the error.
[09:50:01] <cybersholt> yawnnnn looks like theres been some .live excitement
[09:52:20] <nFFF> Anything wrong with this: $('.quantity').css('margin-top','-125');
[09:52:53] <slinq> you should specify a unit
[09:52:54] <slinq> ie px
[09:52:55] <LordThumper> $('.quantity').css('margin-top',-125)
[09:53:10] <LordThumper> or $('.quantity').css('margin-top','-125px')
[09:53:25] <slinq> ya either of those
[09:53:49] <nFFF> nah isnt working
[09:54:06] <nFFF> $('.quantity').css('margin-top','-125px');
[09:54:27] <slinq> $('.quantity').css({'margin-top','-125px'});
[09:55:10] <slinq> oops
[09:55:13] <slinq> $('.quantity').css({'margin-top': '-125px'});
[09:55:15] <slinq> is correct
[09:55:16] <slinq> heh
[09:57:27] <LordThumper> lol didnt notice either ;p
[09:57:38] <nFFF> Yea doesnt work for soem reason
[09:58:17] <SlinQ> $('.quantity').css({'margin-top': '-125px'}); <-- that'll definitely work, if it's not either you have no elements with a class of 'quantity' or, you've done something else to your CSS to make margin-top not relevant
[09:59:03] <LordThumper> $('.quantity').css('margin-left',300) works for me
[09:59:31] <kedarm> Hi! Is  http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/1b51bab47fd983d9  the way to go to make "enter" key result in a custom form submission?
[09:59:37] <nFFF> yea
[09:59:43] <nFFF> Must be something on the page
[10:00:04] <nFFF> I know why
[10:00:05] <nFFF> nvm
[10:00:06] <nFFF> d
[10:00:30] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: back to the .on-wrapping code. Somehow my app script doesn't work. Perhaps it doesn't relate to .on-code, but I get strange error in the console: "Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: )"
[10:00:31] <nFFF> No actually i dont :|
[10:00:44] <ajpiano> that's not a "strange error", it's a syntax error
[10:01:07] <ajpiano> run your code through any of the many automated tools that will identify javascript syntax errors for you, if your console isn't already blatantly pointing to a line and column
[10:01:09] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: yes, but the code itself saves and validates by chrome. This is strange
[10:01:39] <ajpiano> Onkeltem: i'm relatively busy at the moment so all you are going to be able to get from me are catty remarks about the fact that yes, it's strange
[10:01:40] <ajpiano> :)
[10:02:29] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: just wondering why error source is jquery.js itself
[10:02:38] <nFFF> Ok FFS was conflict with $
[10:02:53] <ajpiano> it usually still means you're doing something wrong
[10:03:01] <ajpiano> your error console knows a lot more about this problem than i do
[10:03:01] <Onkeltem> no doubts
[10:03:14] <ajpiano> Onkeltem: try putting your chrome dev tools to use "break on uncaught exceptions"
[10:03:26] <ajpiano> (assuming you're using chrome/saf)
[10:03:34] <Onkeltem> sure.
[10:03:41] <ajpiano> you can do this by pressing the grey "pause" button in the bottom left of your scripts pane
[10:03:47] <ajpiano> until it's purple
[10:04:01] <ajpiano> then the code will stop when it breaks and you can use the call stack to navigate up to your own code that calls jquery
[10:04:14] <Onkeltem> okay, thanks!
[10:05:14] <ajpiano> hope that helps
[10:12:18] <Chopps> hey guys, i want to have a load gif and then fade out the gif and fade in my content, this my code: http://jsfiddle.net/2CpqW/ but its behaving in a weird way, can anyone take a look please?
[10:12:55] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Can you try to focus on the specific issue?
[10:12:58] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ Chopps
[10:12:58] <bot-t> Chopps, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[10:13:06] <Eviltwin> Try to narrow it down as much as possible
[10:13:12] <iNerd> Sigh. in having a script load images on('load') is running too soon
[10:13:26] <iNerd> and buggering me
[10:14:00] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ iNerd
[10:14:00] <bot-t> iNerd, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:15:20] <iNerd> if you mind bras-
[10:16:06] <iNerd> then I guess this is nsfw
[10:16:16] <Eviltwin> Then try to make a demo on jsFiddle
[10:16:19] <Eviltwin> Without bras
[10:16:33] <Nomikos> Anyone know, does the jQuery UI wreak bloody havoc on table row elements in some browsers? or is that doable?
[10:16:35] <iNerd> bleh. I'll try. too much intertwined crap -_-
[10:16:46] <Nomikos> *.sortable (*cough*)
[10:17:16] <ajpiano> Nomikos: it wreaks havoc, use see ?g jquery isocra tablednd
[10:17:18] <bot-t> Nomikos, Table Drag and Drop JQuery plugin | Isocra - http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/
[10:17:36] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: would you take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/DSiF8WTe ? Please....
[10:18:55] <Nomikos> ajpiano: you just saved me an hour at /least/, thank you
[10:19:26] <Nomikos> I'll move this stuff out of tables into .. something else, now.
[10:19:39] <Chopps> Eviltwin, i think the issue is on the $(window).load function, the other code is for a tab layout(the code works), i used the tab layout code because im using that on my irl test site
[10:21:48] <ajpiano> Onkeltem: i may have drastically oversimplified that duckpunch for .on = .delegate
[10:21:50] <ajpiano> :|
[10:22:03] <ajpiano> it's certainly far from guaranteed to work, sorry
[10:22:15] <Onkeltem> oh,ok :)
[10:22:38] <ajpiano> you may actually be better off just physically modifying the code, now i feel so guilty
[10:22:43] <Onkeltem> I liked your approach much :)
[10:22:49] <ajpiano> but i'm not sure that's why you were getting a syntax error, couldn't really look too deeply
[10:23:04] <ajpiano> Onkeltem: if you want to do it right just analyse the source a bit more and test that it's working independently of your app code
[10:23:43] <Onkeltem> ajpiano: what is your typing speed? :)
[10:23:58] <ajpiano> lol i can get up to like 90 wpm
[10:24:04] <Onkeltem> lol
[10:24:21] <kitikonti> hi, i have a little problem with animation. http://jsfiddle.net/kitikonti/xkV88/ this is my testbuild. and i only want to see the content box when the col is full expanded (on hover). it seems to work, but if you only hover quickly over a col the content box gets faded in
[10:27:19] <z1000> is there a .next for elements that are not siblings
[10:28:06] <johnkpaul> z1000: then how would you define .next?
[10:28:16] <z1000> not sure but its not working
[10:28:26] <johnkpaul> I mean, what are you trying to do
[10:28:53] <ajpiano> z1000: if you just want to search the dom in general, you use a cached set and the index methods
[10:29:02] <johnkpaul> .parent().next().firstChild()?
[10:29:07] <z1000> http://collabedit.com/9mmvc
[10:29:18] <z1000> johnkpaul, take a look at that link kinda shows what im trying to do
[10:29:25] <ajpiano> var elems = $(".these"), current = elems.index( this ), next = elems.eq( current + 1);
[10:29:37] <ajpiano> z1000: ^^ assuming 'this' is a dom element with the class .these
[10:29:59] <z1000> ajpiano, my link shows it... howcome not workign :?
[10:30:08] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: no, I think he wants to go up the dom first
[10:30:36] <z1000> I just want to crawl the dom to the next element without any consideration for parents/siblings/children
[10:30:38] <johnkpaul> so for the example you gave z1000, you could use .parent().parent().parent().next(),
[10:30:39] <tripodman> if i do $("#someItem .otherItems").on("click", action()); how can i get rid of the click listeners later
[10:30:43] <johnkpaul> you want to flatten it out
[10:30:46] <ajpiano> z1000: my approach
[10:30:47] <ajpiano> will work
[10:31:07] <ajpiano> it just gets all the elements, gets the current one's index in the set, and then plucks the one at the next index
[10:31:12] <z1000> ajpiano, your suggestions seems a bit advanced
[10:31:23] <ajpiano> z1000: it's really not.
[10:31:29] <johnkpaul> but ajpiano, he wants it to be in the contaxt of another element, something that's not .these
[10:31:34] <tripodman> can i just call off on the same selector
[10:31:39] <z1000> can you help me then ?
[10:31:47] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: well then help him with the travertsal, i think i need to just close #jquery right now
[10:31:49] <ajpiano> too busy to help fully
[10:31:52] <ajpiano> good luck fokls
[10:32:01] <z1000> lol thx anyway buddy
[10:32:19] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:32:42] <johnkpaul> so z1000, my approach would probably be to search upwards until some container that every suite has
[10:32:52] <johnkpaul> and then search down for a .suite
[10:33:12] <johnkpaul> for example $(this).parents(".suite-container").find(".suite-lg")
[10:33:38] <johnkpaul> because it doesn't seem like there's any regularity to where suite-lg can be in relation to .suite
[10:34:03] <johnkpaul> if it's always .parent().parent().parent().parent().next() then you can use that
[10:34:16] <z1000> lol seems crazy but perhaps that will work
[10:34:17] <johnkpaul> although that's horribly unreadable
[10:34:34] <johnkpaul> I mean, don't just cpy and paste what I said
[10:34:37] <johnkpaul> I didn't really count
[10:34:40] <johnkpaul> check in your own dom
[10:34:43] <z1000> ya that worked
[10:34:49] <johnkpaul> :) ok
[10:34:50] <z1000> 		function(){$(this).parent().parent().parent().next('.suite-lg').slideDown(300);
[10:34:59] <johnkpaul> ok
[10:35:03] <z1000> lol is that really bad practice or who cares?
[10:35:25] <johnkpaul> so I'd probably move that into some function called getSuiteLg(this)
[10:35:30] <johnkpaul> or full form of wahtever lg means
[10:35:56] <johnkpaul> it's not a bad practice, that's just a crazy thing to read again after a few weeks when you come back to this code
[10:37:02] <z1000> either way thanks for the help johnkpaul
[10:37:22] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[10:39:19] <johnkpaul> tripodman: did someoone answer you?
[10:39:26] <johnkpaul> you can use .unbind
[10:42:34] <tripodman> johnkpaul: $("#shoppingSets .shoppingSet").off().on("click", function(){}); i'm trying this but i have close to no clue if it's doing what i think it should be doing :P
[10:43:06] <tripodman> i keep reloading the #shoppingSets div many times and i'm afraid of event listeners piling up
[10:44:04] <johnkpaul> just use .delegate and then you don't have to worry about it
[10:44:16] <cybersholt> or . change http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:44:28] <tripodman> johnkpaul:ah i forgot about that. your the man
[10:44:32] <tripodman> you're*
[10:45:51] <tripodman> johnkpaul: i've had some trouble messing with delegate and using "this", maybe i'm crazy
[10:46:27] <johnkpaul> this will be bound to the element where the event is handled, not the elements where the event is dispatched
[10:46:39] <johnkpaul> (I dont' remember if that jargon is completel;y correct, but you should get the idea)
[10:47:31] <tripodman> so if i do $("#shoppingSets").on(".item", "click", function (){}); this will be #shoppingsets right
[10:47:59] <johnkpaul> yes, I'm pretty sure
[10:48:11] <johnkpaul> just try it out, and you'll find out very soon
[10:48:22] <tripodman> johnkpaul: no, that's been my experience
[10:48:27] <johnkpaul> if jsfiddle was loading for me, I could tell you
[10:49:39] <tripodman> yeah, this was the parent, but can i check which child was clicked?
[10:49:51] <johnkpaul> hmm, it's not for me
[10:49:52] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/GLzxY/
[10:49:59] <johnkpaul> I get the li
[10:51:58] <tripodman> johnkpaul: sec
[10:55:19] <tripodman> johnkpaul: ah you're right, for some reason on() wouldnt work but delegate() did
[10:57:40] <nathggns> So I had an idea for a project. Would it be feasable to create a kind of api where you can specify what specfic jquery functions you want, and it will return a bespoke version of jquery with just those functions and their dependcies?
[10:57:58] <jita> Whats the best way to display email form in a modal window ?
[11:00:39] <nathggns> well just write the modal form with pure css and html, then hide+show it when you click a button with jqueryu
[11:02:38] <amalvagomes> I'm writing a new plugin for jQuery and it's my first one.  How do I add functions that you can call after calling the main plugin function to interface with it‚Ä¶ like an API?
[11:03:03] <amalvagomes> I can paste bin it if you'd like to see what I'm playing with.
[11:03:20] <nathggns> okay, pastebin it
[11:03:21] <johnkpaul> amalvagomes: you can add properies to your addition to jQUery.fn as much as you want
[11:03:36] <johnkpaul> so if you have a plugin jQuery.fn.autocompleteWidget
[11:03:57] <johnkpaul> you can add functions to it like jQuery.fn.autocompleteWidget.myStaticFunc = function(){}
[11:04:02] <amalvagomes> johnkpaul: pastebin.com/Yaisx4NQ  Can you repost this with an example?  I'm kind of a newbie...
[11:04:15] <amalvagomes> How would I call that later on?
[11:04:29] <nathggns> what, toggleSelect?
[11:05:11] <amalvagomes> Yeah.  I have it there and I want to be able to call it later on.  The idea I had in mind was to be able to select an html "option" and call toggleSelect on it.
[11:05:26] <nathggns> gimme a sec
[11:05:47] <amalvagomes> Thank you guys so much.  I really appreciate this.
[11:07:11] <sviatovigt> how can I receive more than one variable upon a successful ajax request?
[11:07:22] <johnkpaul> oh you mean you want to call $(".your-selector").multiselect().toggleSelect()
[11:07:27] <johnkpaul> is that right amalvagomes?
[11:08:04] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: if whatever server you use sends a json string, jQuery will pass that entire json object to your sucess callback
[11:08:47] <amalvagomes> Well, I wanted to be able to call $('a selector that selects HTML select tags').multiselect() and then call $('a selector that selects an HTML option tag that is a child of the select tag').toggleSelect()
[11:08:51] <amalvagomes> Is that possible?
[11:09:06] <johnkpaul> "that is a child of the select tag" meaning that it is an option?
[11:09:26] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: can please give me more details?
[11:09:39] <nathggns> amalvagomes, to do that you would write two different plugins
[11:09:42] <nathggns> but
[11:10:08] <amalvagomes> johnkpaul: Yes, something like that.
[11:10:27] <nathggns> I think https://gist.github.com/1870796 would work for you better.
[11:11:24] <amalvagomes> Ah, thank you!
[11:11:27] <amalvagomes> I like that idea.
[11:11:39] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: your backend is sending some string to the frontend when you make that ajax call
[11:11:41] <johnkpaul> what is that string now?
[11:11:53] <sviatovigt> let's say that I want to receive the last inserted id in the database, and a flag whether the request was successfully saved or not
[11:13:13] <nathggns> so you would do $(element).multiselect(opts) then $(element).multiselect("toggleSelect", opts);
[11:13:17] <johnkpaul> so then your server side should return the string "{lastId:123,saved:true}"
[11:13:21] <johnkpaul> with content type application/json
[11:13:29] <johnkpaul> and jQuery will hand you an object as the parameter to success
[11:13:32] <johnkpaul> with two properties
[11:13:35] <johnkpaul> lastId and Saved
[11:13:51] <johnkpaul> nathggns: is that the pattern that jQuery ui uses?
[11:14:06] <nathggns> I dunno, I came up with it for jquery scrollbars
[11:14:13] <nathggns> it might
[11:38:05] <krz> http://www.mixcloud.com/aboveandbeyond/above-beyond-tatw-412/ how do they provide the embed link to the player?
[11:38:30] <krz> so it can be copied
[11:55:32] <rosalindwills> is there an easy way to tell jquery to wrap specific rows of a table in a tbody tag? i.e. find the 3rd through 5th rows of a table and wrap tbody around it?
[11:58:41] <nveid> hey
[11:58:47] <nveid> Having some issues with some jquery: http://pastebin.com/YivaMDGR
[11:59:05] <nveid> basically.. my each loop in reorder_fields.. doesn't look like its looping through & building a string up
[11:59:31] <darcyclarke> nveid you're saying string =
[11:59:32] <nveid> Curious, if someone can point out to me what I'm doing wrong
[11:59:36] <dabear> nveid: string +=
[11:59:36] <nveid> Oh!

[12:04:31] <sviatovigt> for some unknown reason, when I specify the dataType option inside $.ajax, although that section of code it is executed, and it is executed successfully, the code inside success it will not be ran
[12:04:56] <sviatovigt> if I comment the line with dataType, the content of success executes without any problem
[12:05:09] <sviatovigt> does anyone have any idea where should I look?
[12:05:49] <ilriso> Hi guys
[12:06:06] <nathggns> Hello
[12:06:29] <ilriso> I'm using jquery ui to create a nice menu for my site, how can I make the top level menu items to follow the link they're supposed to?
[12:06:46] <ilriso> (i'm using the accordion)
[12:06:47] <krz> http://www.mixcloud.com/aboveandbeyond/above-beyond-tatw-412/ how do they provide the embed link to the player?
[12:09:11] <niels__> anyone got/knows a good jquery bundle for textmate?
[12:09:12] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: do you have an error callback in $.ajax?
[12:09:37] <sviatovigt> no, I don't
[12:10:05] <edulterado> hi, I¬¥m learning javascript/jquery and I was wondering how can I make use the value of a function/variable, that has a local scope, outside the function where they was declared; more specifically: http://pastebin.com/6S6F5Nik
[12:10:23] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: add one, the 3rd parameter is the error object that was thrown
[12:10:31] <johnkpaul> if success isn't called, error is
[12:10:41] <sviatovigt> I do not realy know how to use the jqXHR
[12:10:50] <sviatovigt> I'm a beginner
[12:11:02] <sviatovigt> and I try to avoid things that I don't know
[12:11:23] <johnkpaul> success:function(){}, error:function(xhr, status, errorObject){console.log(errorObject)}
[12:11:34] <johnkpaul> then look in your console and you'll have a little better idea as to what the erorr is
[12:11:54] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ scroll to error
[12:13:33] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul:...
[12:13:37] <sviatovigt> you are right
[12:13:40] <sviatovigt> error is called
[12:13:46] <sviatovigt> but I do not understand why
[12:13:58] <johnkpaul> did you look in the console at that error object
[12:14:02] <johnkpaul> if you click it, you should see a message
[12:14:17] <Jester831> anyone used jsrender/observable/jsview?
[12:14:31] <sviatovigt> I only get the values that I send from PHP in a json format...
[12:14:43] <johnkpaul> edulterado: you can't name a variable "new" it is a reserved word
[12:15:02] <johnkpaul> edulterado: so I can't really tell what you're trying to do in that pastebin
[12:15:05] <sviatovigt> jhonkpaul: this is what I get: Object { lastId="25", status="saved"}
[12:15:25] <sviatovigt> and if I click on it I will get the same thing
[12:15:55] <johnkpaul> hmm, what version of jquery are you using?
[12:16:04] <johnkpaul> ^^ sviatovigt
[12:16:22] <sviatovigt> where can I see that because I don't really remember
[12:16:35] <sviatovigt> one of the latest versions anyway
[12:17:09] <sviatovigt> jhonkpaul: in the documentation I found this: Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests
[12:17:22] <sviatovigt> is this the reason?
[12:17:40] <johnkpaul> run $().jquery to get the version
[12:17:41] <edulterado> johnkpaul: I was trying to make test() to returns the value of 'new' outside the function where it was declared
[12:17:42] <sviatovigt> no, it is not, stupid question
[12:17:55] <edulterado> johnkpaul: is it possible such a thing?
[12:17:58] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: then it _woudn't be called :)
[12:18:10] <sviatovigt> yes
[12:18:13] <sviatovigt> indeed
[12:18:16] <johnkpaul> so the question is, why is it an error
[12:18:22] <johnkpaul> can you console.log(arguments) in your error handler
[12:18:27] <johnkpaul> and see if that brings any more light
[12:18:38] <johnkpaul> edulterado: I don't realy understand what you mean "outside the function where it was declared
[12:18:44] <johnkpaul> you want it to return the string "new" all the time?
[12:19:09] <kavi_> hi am trying to implement jstree..in my application ..and am having a problem with cookies plugin
[12:19:18] <kavi_> it is going to an infinite loop..
[12:19:21] <edulterado> johnkpaul: well, I would like the value of 'new' to be modified by the function, and make use of that modified value in other functions
[12:19:37] <kavi_> any suggestions/help...pls
[12:20:06] <kavi_> is this the right place to post this question??
[12:20:41] <johnkpaul> edulterado: so you want to use test outside of the scope where it is defined? then you need to define the variable outside of it
[12:21:00] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul:  console.log($().jquery) will not bring anything out
[12:21:02] <kavi_> hi
[12:21:09] <johnkpaul> kavi_: it is, but you're prbably going to have to wait for someone with jstree experience to come around
[12:21:24] <jeffreylevesque> my CMS is generating list items with div tags inside it.  Sometimes the div tags are empty.  I'd like to display:none for these occurances.  Is this proper syntax: $('.profile-certificate').each(function(){ if(!this.div.hasChildNodes){ $(this).css('display', 'none'); } }); ?
[12:21:28] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: try jQuery().jquery
[12:21:34] <johnkpaul> maybe your $ isn't mapped to jquery
[12:21:41] <sviatovigt> jhonkpaul: console.log(arguments)  doesn't give me more information at well
[12:21:43] <kavi_> johnkpaul - ok. thank u..
[12:21:46] <sviatovigt> it is
[12:21:58] <sviatovigt> otherwise probably it wouldn't work
[12:22:35] <macobo> Are they keys and valuables stored by .data methods accesible by tools such as firebug/etc?
[12:22:43] <johnkpaul> in your console, type $().jquery and run it
[12:23:06] <johnkpaul> macobo: yes, they aren't stored anywhere special, it's all in regular userspace variables/data structres
[12:23:59] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: huston we have a problem
[12:24:06] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: how do I do that
[12:24:17] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:24:17] <kavi_> anyone with jstree experience???
[12:24:17] <ryanneufeld> so, I'm trying to figure out why this doesn't work the way I expect it to... http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Y8ZNU/2/
[12:24:18] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: I'm using firebug
[12:24:25] <johnkpaul> so in firebug, in the console tab
[12:24:31] <johnkpaul> type $().jquery
[12:24:33] <johnkpaul> and hit enter
[12:24:59] <sviatovigt> ok
[12:25:05] <sviatovigt> version 1.7.1
[12:25:05] <johnkpaul> kavi_: just wait a bit and ask your whole question again
[12:25:11] <johnkpaul> or post in the jstree support forums or something
[12:25:17] <bjensen> what do people use for in place edit now a days?
[12:25:26] <johnkpaul> ok good, so you have the most recent version sviatovigt
[12:25:48] <johnkpaul> so now, console.log(arguments) in the error handler, doesnt' show anything in your firebug console?
[12:25:56] <johnkpaul> ryanneufeld: how do you expect it to wor
[12:26:06] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: no, it doesn't
[12:26:21] <johnkpaul> hmm, that means that it's no longer called
[12:26:25] <johnkpaul> did you change something else?
[12:26:29] <sviatovigt> no
[12:26:34] <sviatovigt> but it is called
[12:26:43] <sviatovigt> I have left the rest of the code there
[12:26:52] <johnkpaul> it is called, but nothing is logged to the console?
[12:26:53] <kavi_> <johnkpaul> i have a problem with cookies plugin in jstree. it is running into an infinite loop..
[12:27:07] <sviatovigt> I can see what's inside errorObject, but arguments it's empty
[12:27:16] <johnkpaul> hmm, that's really odd
[12:27:23] <johnkpaul> then try individually console logging the arguments
[12:27:50] <johnkpaul> kavi_: so that isn't really a lot of information, have you tried going through the cookies plugin using a debugger and seeing where the infinite loop happens?
[12:27:59] <johnkpaul> or maybe, you could create a test case in jsfiddle
[12:28:04] <johnkpaul> that way, we could easily debug and help you
[12:29:11] <ryanneufeld> johnkpaul: well the last item in the q is throwing an illegal invocation
[12:29:17] <johnkpaul> not for me
[12:29:18] <johnkpaul> in FF 10
[12:29:28] <ryanneufeld> johnkpaul: I'm in chrome
[12:29:29] <ryanneufeld> 17
[12:30:36] <ryanneufeld> okay, so it seems that it doesn't work in chrome, that's fine
[12:30:42] <johnkpaul> I think it's because console.log is a native/host/builtin that acts oddle
[12:30:44] <johnkpaul> console.log.apply(this,["what"]) doesn't work either
[12:30:44] <ryanneufeld> probably not the best usage of it anyway
[12:30:46] <johnkpaul> >> console.log.apply(this,["what"])
[12:30:47] <bjensen> how can you, as a plugin developer, have a dependency to an old outdated plugin!?!? Oh wait..its because you are the author of it
[12:31:01] <kavi_> <johnkpaul> - http://jsfiddle.net/kavithak/hYkXe/
[12:31:12] <johnkpaul> is there no jsbot in #jquery?
[12:31:30] <ryanneufeld> eval console.log.apply(this,["what"])
[12:31:36] <ryanneufeld> ?eval console.log.apply(this,["what"])
[12:31:36] <johnkpaul> kavi_: so where is this inifinite loop?
[12:31:37] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: "what"
[12:31:40] <johnkpaul> ah
[12:31:47] <johnkpaul> ?eval
[12:31:47] <bot-t> johnkpaul: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[12:32:26] <ryanneufeld> see I'm trying to replicate how google analytics does it's event queing
[12:32:28] <kavi_> this is my code- in bind select node when am trying to redirect to a different page
[12:32:33] <amites> Any ideas why ajax loaded content would not be scriptable? running alert(obj_id) through firebug keeps returning object with contents == null...  -- haven't copied over to jsfiddle yet thought I'd see if this triggered something for anyone
[12:32:49] <Es0teric> how do i do over/out hover states with on() ?
[12:32:55] <amites> the content is loaded via ajax into a colorbox if that makes a difference
[12:33:18] <kavi_> i used cookies plugin to maintain the state of the node. after including that plugin ..it is running into infinite loop.
[12:33:21] <johnkpaul> ryanneufeld: I think tht what you have is a really good way to do it
[12:33:32] <ryanneufeld> I thought so tooo
[12:33:32] <johnkpaul> only comment is that you always have Array.prototype.push
[12:33:43] <johnkpaul> so you don't necessarily need to keep it around
[12:33:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I was being safe
[12:33:48] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: can it be because I'm sending a variable called status inside the jason string?
[12:34:00] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: not that I know of
[12:34:04] <kavi_> if the cookies plugin is not present , the code works as expected but it does not maintain the state of the nodes(closed/open)
[12:34:07] <sviatovigt> now it's working, but I haven't done anything special
[12:34:29] <johnkpaul> kavi_: when you say inifintie loop, do you know where that is, or is it just that your UI is freezing u
[12:34:58] <kavi_> the browser is refreshing n refreshing...
[12:35:13] <johnkpaul> ryanneufeld: console.log.apply(console,"what")
[12:35:15] <johnkpaul> works fine in chrome
[12:35:27] <johnkpaul> apparently console _requires_ itself to be run in it's own context
[12:35:31] <johnkpaul> which actually makes complete sense
[12:35:47] <johnkpaul> that's what hapens when you have something unspeced that people rely on
[12:35:51] <johnkpaul> gratefully it's just for development
[12:35:53] <tyoc213> Hi there, I need to watch for changes on a big table
[12:36:00] <tyoc213> it is a last div/row
[12:36:12] <johnkpaul> kavi_: my recommendation would be to dig into that coookie plugin
[12:36:17] <johnkpaul> and use firebug/chrome and breakpoints
[12:36:18] <tyoc213> how do I do it? aparently $("table").change is a little slow
[12:36:33] <johnkpaul> and see if you can find that code that resets window.location or something
[12:36:38] <johnkpaul> such taht it refreses and refreshes
[12:36:46] <tyoc213> I have already tried DOMSubtreeModified and DOMNodeInserted
[12:36:52] <tyoc213> but they seem a little slow also
[12:37:05] <tyoc213> and DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument doesnt launch the event at all
[12:37:38] <johnkpaul> tyoc213: does this have to hapen synchronously?
[12:37:49] <kavi_> <johnkpaul> - http://www.jstree.com/faq
[12:37:57] <johnkpaul> I'd probably just setup some interval that checks every some time, but I don't know if that's the best way
[12:37:58] <tyoc213> if possible, I have a link that add the row with all the elements
[12:38:08] <kavi_> has this question. but i didnt understand very clearly about the solution
[12:38:10] <Es0teric> how do i hover over an element in jquery, change what the element says then when i hover out, it goes back to what it is?
[12:38:18] <kavi_> i will try firebug..and debug
[12:38:20] <tyoc213> johnkpaul: for example Im thinking of a setTimeout and execute the code I want each x ms
[12:38:36] <johnkpaul> tyoc213: yeah that would be my solution, use setInterval and not timeout though
[12:38:41] <tyoc213> johnkpaul: that seem by now the most easy and fast way to execute it
[12:38:48] <QueueQueue> Es0teric: you can do that with the jquery .hover
[12:38:53] <tyoc213> O yeah, I mean that...
[12:39:09] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, i know but how do i revert back to what the element was?
[12:39:13] <johnkpaul> kavi_: oh, that page gives you your answer, and code to fix it
[12:39:17] <tyoc213> so johnkpaul there is no good way to watch for the add event (for a last row) of a table?
[12:39:38] <kavi_> but it doesnt seems to work..
[12:39:38] <johnkpaul> there are, you already named the
[12:39:39] <johnkpaul> m
[12:39:44] <johnkpaul> ^^ tyoc213
[12:40:04] <kavi_> <johnkpaul> - i will be back in few secs
[12:40:14] <johnkpaul> kavi_: the code that you sent me didn't have anything like that
[12:40:18] <QueueQueue> Es0teric: have you looked into .mouseover and .mouseenter ?
[12:40:30] <QueueQueue> and .mouseout
[12:40:53] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, i KNOW how to use hover -_- i just want to know how to revert back to what the element was on mouseout
[12:41:08] <QueueQueue> read the 2nd line
[12:41:12] <tyoc213> johnkpaul: thanks for the clarification
[12:41:28] <Es0teric> QueueQueue what?
[12:41:31] <tyoc213> johnkpaul: I will try the Interval with some wards on the length of the table
[12:41:34] <QueueQueue> .mouseout
[12:41:34] <ryanneufeld> johnkpaul: thanks for the assistance
[12:41:39] <tyoc213> guards*
[12:41:43] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[12:42:23] <Es0teric> QueueQueue I KNOW WHAT .MOUSEOUT IS‚Ä¶ you arent answering my question - i said REVERT back to the element AFTER mouseout happens
[12:42:24] <gyzmodo> can i use two parametrs $(window).bind("load", function() {... load & resize?
[12:42:57] <QueueQueue> ...
[12:43:13] <AustinS> Es0teric, calm down
[12:43:25] <QueueQueue> if you manipulate the element on mouse in you have to manipulate it on mouseout..
[12:43:32] <Chopps> hey guys, is there any way to append an extra element to another element, but append it before X element?
[12:43:51] <QueueQueue> unless its simple css properties
[12:43:56] <QueueQueue> which you'd do in css anyways
[12:43:56] <AustinS> Chopps: could use prepend on x
[12:43:57] <warrenparsons> Chopps: .prepend() / .prependTo()
[12:44:03] <kavi> hi am back..somebody was talking to me..
[12:44:04] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, ok thats what i needed to know
[12:44:13] <kavi> may i know who was that
[12:44:32] <Chopps> oh thanks AustinS, i will take a look, ty for the quick reply :D
[12:45:09] <kavi> johnkpaul - i didnt understand the solution and tat didnt work for me
[12:48:32] <slartsa> I'm having an area with div elements inside, I'm adding div elements to that area and I want those div elements to go go smaller so they could fit, anyone had done anything like this?
[12:48:34] <sviatovigt> johnkpaul: thanks for the help! may I ask you one more question?
[12:49:20] <ssbr_> Hey guys. What does it mean for a function to be defined where you have "$(function() { ...});" ?
[12:49:37] <erichynds> ssbr_: shortcut for $(document).ready(fn)
[12:49:52] <ssbr_> erichynds: ah, much thanks!
[12:50:57] <Es0teric> what function do i use to get a child element in the div i specify? so if i have a <div class="someClass"><p>test paragraph <b>bolded paragraph</b></p></div> <-- how do i grab the <p> tag in that paragraph?
[12:51:02] <Es0teric> *in that div
[12:51:19] <amites> Can anyone help me understand why I keep getting the error -- [cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector -- http://jsfiddle.net/RuTkU/1/
[12:51:29] <QueueQueue> $('.someClass p')
[12:51:55] <kavi> any help with cookies plugin infinite loop??
[12:53:39] <QueueQueue> amites: when you click on the colorbox open?
[12:53:42] <Es0teric> QueueQueue i am talking about if i have var divclass = $('.someClass');.. how do i get a function to get the <p> tag?
[12:53:56] <amites> QueueQueue: yes
[12:55:05] <QueueQueue> Es0teric: $('p', divclass)
[12:55:16] <amites> QueueQueue: error appears in Console of Firebug & Dev Tools in Chromium -- tried cycling through the div by id manually and kept getting null for $('#dom_id').each()
[12:55:18] <QueueQueue> is that what you're referring to?
[12:55:20] <johnkpaul> sviatovigt: just ask, someone other than m might respond :)
[12:55:22] <johnkpaul> m*
[12:55:32] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, let me try
[12:55:36] <johnkpaul> kavi: what didn't you undersand about the solution that they offered on their own faq page?
[12:55:50] <johnkpaul> ask more direct questions, that makes it seem like you did some research on your own, and you'll get more help
[12:55:59] <QueueQueue> amites: when I click that box it works fine for me in chrome
[12:56:15] <amites> QueueQueue: do the images at the bottom cycle?
[12:56:45] <QueueQueue> amites: are you referring to the windmill?
[12:56:52] <QueueQueue> amites: if so, no it just stays on that image.
[12:56:53] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, that works..
[12:57:02] <FunnyLookinHat> I'm trying to drag and drop items ( <div class="object"> ) from one div to another ( <div class="parent1"> to <div class="parent2"> ) - but parent1 and parent2 have overflow-y: scroll because they need to display lists... I noticed that this breaks the ability to drag an item from one div to another - any way to get around this?
[12:57:04] <kavi> <johnkpaul> - i tried that but what is happening is that it is not refereshing the page but the bind select node event is not being called
[12:57:26] <amites> QueueQueue: exactly, if you inspect that element there are 5+ images there meant to rotate -- that's where the error shows up
[12:57:46] <amites> QueueQueue: My apologies for not being specific in the error I'm trying to debug
[12:58:27] <johnkpaul> kavi: after the first time the select_node.jstree event happens, can you check window.first, and make sure that it has the value true?
[12:58:30] <QueueQueue> amites: hmm, I am not getting an error in the console or anything, though they don't rotate. Strange.
[12:59:28] <nitrospectide> I am using a dead simple line of jquery to try to apply a style to something, and I am getting nothing. What do I need to look at to sort it out? The line is: $("div").css("border","1px solid red");
[12:59:55] <cybersholt> try this $("div").css({"border","1px solid red"});
[13:00:26] <QueueQueue> amites: I think I see an issue.... You're not passing in any id to cycle_photos so it's defaulting to the selector #sidebar_photos
[13:00:41] <QueueQueue> amites: and the photos are contained within a parent named project-photos
[13:00:46] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: no improvement
[13:01:04] <nitrospectide> What could be gunking it up?
[13:01:07] <QueueQueue> ** project_photos
[13:01:08] <QueueQueue> er
[13:01:09] <QueueQueue> no
[13:01:12] <QueueQueue> I was right the first time xD
[13:01:24] <warrenparsons> nitrospectide: $('div').css({ border: '1px solid red' });
[13:01:46] <cybersholt> thats what i said
[13:01:53] <QueueQueue> amites: yeah you're passing in the wrong id
[13:01:54] <warrenparsons> If you're using object notation, make sure you're passing in an object.
[13:01:58] <amites> QueueQueue: *smacks head* had the wrong id to cycle -- thank you
[13:02:09] <cybersholt> nitro u try and give it an id like foo can calling #foo?
[13:02:13] <Jester831> what's the best way to parse something like $1.00 into a float?
[13:02:16] <johnkpaul> ryanneufeld: that console.log context issue is a wontfix bug in chromium http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=48662
[13:02:17] <warrenparsons> cybersholt: No, not at all. You weren't using object notation.
[13:02:45] <cybersholt> ahh my bad just woke back up lol
[13:02:53] <nitrospectide> warrenparsons: still nothing
[13:03:20] <cybersholt> try this nitro $('#foo').css("color","red");
[13:03:21] <warrenparsons> nitrospectide: Do you have this function in a $(document).ready(){} ?
[13:03:35] <cybersholt> give your div an id of foo
[13:03:50] <kavi> <johnkpaul> - i was not checking for window.first ..i was just checking for first.. thank you..it resolved.
[13:03:55] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: I stripped off all classes in my selector so it would simply outline any and all divs. there seems to be something more fundamental
[13:04:28] <cybersholt> ahhh i see hmmm no js errors in the console?
[13:04:29] <johnkpaul> kavi: great, you're welcome, have fun
[13:04:34] <jeffsmykil> Will .attr() only get me valid attributes or will it get me anything I make up?
[13:04:57] <nitrospectide> warrenparsons: cybersholt: full script file: http://pastie.org/3422962
[13:04:57] <QueueQueue> jeff: It should work for any attribute
[13:05:15] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Even if it will grab invalid attributes, I wouldn't trust that it will do so forever.
[13:05:26] <jeffreylevesque> can someone assist me turning the existing example: http://jsfiddle.net/zv4hM/19 to something that includes accompanying text for each slide?
[13:05:27] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: hrm
[13:05:31] <jeffreylevesque> this was my attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/zv4hM/21/
[13:05:40] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: this error: event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[13:05:40] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: That's the kind of thing that gets fixed in point releases.
[13:05:48] <jeffsmykil> but its handy
[13:06:10] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: You can/should probably use data attributes instead of invalid code.
[13:06:20] <cybersholt> yes thats fine nitro look @ this http://jsfiddle.net/vShSX/1/
[13:06:35] <jeffsmykil> never used data attributes can is that just a data="">
[13:06:37] <QueueQueue> warrenparsons: I don't know if it would be "fixed". Custom attributes are common in html.. It's more of a feature. Standard compliant or not xD
[13:06:46] <cybersholt> i think that will fix ya up
[13:07:00] * faithlove is away (Gone fishing!)
[13:07:03] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: data-myCustomName="blah"
[13:07:21] <warrenparsons> QueueQueue: It still makes me twitch.
[13:07:47] <jeffsmykil> and to get data I do $(this).attr("data")?
[13:07:54] <cybersholt> nitrospectide: did that fix ya up or u still having problems?
[13:07:57] <QueueQueue> jeff: yes
[13:07:58] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Then to read it in jQuery, use $(this).data('myCustomName');
[13:08:24] <jeffsmykil> if there is no custom name i can merely go data()?
[13:08:34] <matt_> is there a way to listen for a jquery event from another script?
[13:08:43] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: that's what I had started with
[13:08:44] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: I believe that will return an object/array of all data attributes on the element. Best to check the docs, tho.
[13:08:50] <QueueQueue> matt_: what do you mean?
[13:08:59] <cybersholt> and u're not getting a result at all?
[13:09:41] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: nothing
[13:09:51] <cybersholt> hmm both ways are working for me
[13:09:52] <matt_> QueueQueue: working in drupal cms and using a module that creates a slideshow, but I want to listen for the firing of the transition so I can create other animations timed with it.
[13:10:02] <warrenparsons> ?data
[13:10:03] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:10:43] * jeffsmykil reads
[13:10:44] <corrosionx> Can anyone tell me why a $('select').change(function() { ... });  wouldn't work?  Nothing is fired when I change the dropdown value...
[13:10:47] <cybersholt> maybe you are having an error with another script or jq plugin
[13:10:54] <QueueQueue> matt_: Can you not modify the source of the slideshow to call a method you define on the event?
[13:10:59] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: You want the second use case for your situation.
[13:11:05] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: I don't think it's a syntax issue. I think something upstream is wrong‚Ä¶ but no idea what that could be? The script is being loaded...
[13:11:34] <matt_> QueueQueue: trying not to.  We are using git so i'd have to fork the module.. bad news.
[13:11:41] <cybersholt> and the other jq on the page works??? is the dom showing ready???
[13:12:23] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: I just threw in alert("OK"); and that is not working :(
[13:12:36] <cybersholt> wow mannnnnn
[13:12:39] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Data attributes are probably my favorite addition in HTML5. Makes tons of things so much cleaner where we used to use flag classes, custom attributes, etc.
[13:13:03] <cybersholt> double check that you are getting jquery loaded on the page
[13:13:05] <jeffsmykil> not using html 5
[13:13:06] <jeffsmykil> :/
[13:13:17] <cybersholt> see if you can get an alert to work in a document.ready
[13:13:22] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Switch your doctype and use the data attributes. You don't have to use any of the new tags.
[13:13:52] <QueueQueue> corrosionx: that should work...
[13:14:09] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Truth is jQuery will probably read the data attributes regardless.
[13:14:15] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[13:14:15] <matt_> QueueQueue: any other ideas?  is there no way to just listen for an event?
[13:15:11] <ryanneufeld> thanks johnkpaul
[13:15:11] <cybersholt> nitrospectide: just one step at a time, make sure everything is loading and ok
[13:15:21] <QueueQueue> matt_: off hand I am not sure if you can listen for the event in that manner, I am thinking of a way you could achieve that though.
[13:15:27] <jeffsmykil> ty QueueQueue and warrenparsons
[13:16:34] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: I am getting an error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;
[13:16:44] <corrosionx> QueueQueue: Just tried it with $("select") and it does work... it doesn't work when I try $('.selectclass')  weird
[13:16:46] <nitrospectide> on this: http://pastie.org/3422962
[13:16:56] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: yi
[13:16:57] <QueueQueue> corrosionx: what browser?
[13:17:02] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: That is, yw
[13:17:52] <gehsekky> nitrospectide: $(document).ready(function () { });
[13:17:52] <QueueQueue> corrosionx: ah yes, I recall IE having issues with .change on dropdown lists.... You're using IE I assume
[13:18:00] <Es0teric> someClass.hover(function(){ $this.addClass('testclass1'); }, function() { $this.removeClass('testclass1') }) <-- thats not working for me for some reason
[13:18:46] <QueueQueue> Es0teric: missing a ;
[13:18:51] <cybersholt> here nitro u have a typo
[13:18:52] <cybersholt> http://jsfiddle.net/vShSX/1/
[13:18:56] <FunnyLookinHat> Any idea how I can get jQueryUI draggable/droppable to work with div tags that have scrolling enabled?  http://jsfiddle.net/74V7S/
[13:19:09] <Es0teric> QueueQueue, i added the ; and still wont work
[13:19:11] <corrosionx> queuequeue: no, Chrome... just tried it in Firefox and it does work... when I use $('select') in CHrome it works once only..
[13:19:41] <QueueQueue> corrosionx: I recall having to use a different means to handle this for dropdown lists, let me see if I can find what I did before
[13:20:22] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: I'm doing var RuleSequenceLength = $(this).data('rules');
[13:20:53] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: what typo?
[13:20:54] <jeffsmykil> and my data-rules="foo"
[13:21:03] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: That looks right.
[13:21:13] <jeffsmykil> yeah it does :/
[13:21:14] <nitrospectide> gehsekky: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[13:21:22] <nitrospectide> but jQuery is loading
[13:21:26] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Assuming "rules" isn't some odd reserved word.
[13:21:38] <cybersholt> nitrospectide: it needs to look like this u forgot a ) on document $(document).ready(function() {});
[13:21:58] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: foo gives it the same result
[13:22:04] <jeffsmykil> so unless both are reserved
[13:22:12] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: I'm pretty sure foo isn't LOL
[13:22:14] <corrosionx> queuequeue: I got it to work once on Chrome but now it doesn't work again...  I think I remmeber select boxes having that problem with jquery for a long time.
[13:22:41] <QueueQueue> corrosionx it works fine for me in chrome
[13:22:48] <QueueQueue> as $('select').change(function(){alert('test');});
[13:23:27] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: ok. I put that in. now I get: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[13:23:37] <QueueQueue> nitro: are you including js before jquery
[13:23:42] <QueueQueue> nitro that uses jquery
[13:24:09] <QueueQueue> can you post a link to the code ?
[13:24:26] <cybersholt> you may have to put jquery into no conflict mode but that message usually means theres a problem with jq
[13:25:37] <nitrospectide> QueueQueue: http://pastie.org/3422962
[13:25:53] <nitrospectide> jquery is in the head before that script
[13:25:58] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/9XRPy/
[13:26:22] <QueueQueue> nitro: is jquery the only js you're including on that page?
[13:26:36] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Are you using an HTML5 doctype? I might be wrong about jQuery not caring...
[13:26:53] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Or are you using a version of jQuery prior to 1.6?
[13:27:26] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Actually, 1.4 and up works for me.
[13:27:26] <sviatovigt> my $.ajax function returns a html response containing an html template that I need to use
[13:27:38] <sviatovigt> the response is stored in the variable template
[13:27:56] <sviatovigt> if try to issue template.find() I receive an error
[13:27:59] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: im just changing it to a class :/
[13:28:03] <sviatovigt> how can I avoid this issue?
[13:28:08] <sviatovigt> does anyone knows?
[13:28:27] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Heh, okay. Something to keep in mind for the future anyway. It really is handy as all get out.
[13:28:49] <jeffsmykil> well except now class isn't working wtf
[13:28:59] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: doesn't find only search the dom?
[13:29:17] <nitrospectide> QueueQueue: no. http://pastie.org/3423120 the scripts are all loaded separately in dev, but will be aggregated in production
[13:29:18] <sviatovigt> good question
[13:29:31] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: are you just receiving the mark up as a string into the variable? If thats the case you can't search for it as it isn't in the dom
[13:30:10] <sviatovigt> the documentation doesn't say anything about this restriction
[13:30:25] <cybersholt> nitro when i go to http://d7basetest.dev/sites/all/modules/jquery_update/replace/jquery/jquery.min.js?v=1.5.2 i get nothing i assume this is where u get jQuery from
[13:30:32] <sviatovigt> ok, it does
[13:30:36] <cybersholt> oops
[13:30:36] <sviatovigt> I have looked closely
[13:30:39] <cybersholt> lol
[13:30:45] <dangerousdave> whats the best way to set the "top" property of an element please?
[13:30:55] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: from the docs  "Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .find() method allows us to search through the descendants of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements."
[13:31:14] <sviatovigt> I have seen now
[13:31:19] <corrosionx> QueueQueue: http://pel.demo-wec.com/products/chairs/chair-112717/  there are 2 select boxes and something should happen when you change the value...  it works in Firefox, Safari, IE... turns out only Chrome doesn't work
[13:31:29] <sviatovigt> but I should be able to search here too
[13:31:37] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: note the .dev domain. It is resolving on a local MAMP install
[13:31:46] <cybersholt> yeah that was my bad
[13:31:59] <cybersholt> :P just woke up from a nap
[13:32:19] <cybersholt> i would strip it down to just jQ and progressively add from there
[13:32:43] <corrosionx> QueueQueue: but I think there's another path I can take for the same result... thanks
[13:32:58] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: I am going to ask in the chan for the CMS first, since stripping everything out is no easy task
[13:33:49] <cybersholt> yeah i feel ya somethings probly hanging jQ up did u try jQuery('div').css({ border: '1px solid red' });
[13:34:33] <QueueQueue> nitro: did you check in your debugger to verify that all your js sources are being loaded
[13:34:48] <cybersholt> i saw @ the bottom of your js for some menu was loading a jq function like that
[13:35:01] <QueueQueue> nitro: you're 100% sure that jquery exists at "http://d7basetest.dev/sites/all/modules/jquery_update/replace/jquery/jquery.min.js?v=1.5.2"  ?
[13:35:12] <qom2> http://www.walkerart.org/ <- looking for a top stories slider like this one, anyone know one?
[13:35:31] <cybersholt> Queue that is his local domain
[13:35:48] <cybersholt> i said the same
[13:36:03] <QueueQueue> Yeah, but if the path is wrong it won't work xD
[13:36:33] <cybersholt> yea thats what i said i always put a failsafe on mine call from CDN with local fall back or vice versa
[13:36:42] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: this.data just gives me an empty object
[13:37:08] <cybersholt> ehhhh need more coffee i guess
[13:37:16] <nitrospectide> QueueQueue: I have to confess I'm not totally sure how to check that everything is loading. I use the WebKit inspector to check the page source for the script link, and click through to the script. It is in fact there.
[13:37:25] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: What about $(this).data? Unless this is already a jQuery object, the data method won't work right.
[13:37:36] <jeffsmykil> yeah i was just lazy
[13:37:37] <jeffsmykil> there is
[13:37:40] <warrenparsons> k
[13:38:03] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Is the page online and something you could link to?
[13:38:13] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately not
[13:38:17] <warrenparsons> k
[13:38:21] <cybersholt> nitro u can also try window.jQuery or window.$ see what that returns
[13:38:32] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Did you switch to an HTML5 doctype?
[13:38:44] <jeffsmykil> thats next
[13:38:44] <Hor1zon> hi
[13:38:56] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: That could be it. Like I said, I could be wrong about jQuery not caring.
[13:39:06] <QueueQueue> nitro, in chrome debugger click on "Resources", under "Frames" you will see scripts
[13:39:17] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: the weird thing is it doesn
[13:39:18] <QueueQueue> it shows all the scripts being loaded on that page
[13:39:28] <jeffsmykil> t care if i put it in class or rel or data its coming back undefined
[13:39:39] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Definitely weird.
[13:39:49] <warrenparsons> Is the element in the page at load time?
[13:40:13] <jeffsmykil> no but im using live
[13:40:15] <jeffsmykil> $("#alertType").append("<option rel='" + types[i].AlertTypeId  + "' value='" + types[i].AlertRule + "'>" + types[i].AlertDescription + "</option>");
[13:40:23] <jeffsmykil> thats building the select
[13:40:37] <jeffsmykil> ive tried rel data class
[13:40:38] <jeffsmykil> nothing
[13:40:44] <jeffsmykil> and the value is good
[13:40:51] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Ahhhh. I don't think any of those are valid on option tags.
[13:41:02] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[13:41:06] <Hor1zon> i'm using ajax to get a pre compiled form from a php script, and i'm using a jquery plugin (.ajaxSubmit();) but it wont work with the ajax loaded form, if i write the form in the page manually it works, but if i load the form from ajax nothing happens :( someone know why?
[13:41:12] <jeffsmykil> how can I store another bit of data than warrenparsons
[13:41:18] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Option is handled differently than just about anything else.
[13:41:33] <cybersholt> jeff have u tried delegate or on ?
[13:41:47] <jeffsmykil> instead of live?
[13:41:50] <jeffsmykil> I know i should
[13:41:56] <cybersholt> yeah
[13:41:59] <jeffsmykil> but i have stuck with what I know
[13:42:00] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: cybersholt Wouldn't matter for this case.
[13:42:02] <cybersholt> live is depreciated
[13:42:10] <QueueQueue> hor1zon: so you're appending the form html from the server and the event isn't working? Is that the issue?
[13:42:36] <jeffsmykil> cybersholt: yeah I know it is
[13:42:52] <cybersholt> just my 2 c worth the :)
[13:42:55] <cybersholt> then*
[13:42:56] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Yeah, I'm not even positive ID is valid on option LOL
[13:43:19] <QueueQueue> warren: can't say I've tried that myself... lol
[13:43:28] <QueueQueue> warren: it doesn't sound right to say the least.
[13:43:52] <Hor1zon> yes, i have an empty div and i do $('#id').html(ajaxresponse); the form appear but when i do $('#form_id').ajaxSubmit(); it doesn't work
[13:44:02] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: You might have to something funky with checking the value of the parent select on each change event, and running from there.
[13:44:35] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Option just isn't really treated as its own element where the DOM is concerned.
[13:44:41] <QueueQueue> hor1zon where are you calling the ajaxSubmit event?
[13:44:42] <warrenparsons> At least not in any normal way.
[13:46:04] <Hor1zon> QueueQueue, i show an apprise with this http://thrivingkings.com/apprise/ , in the apprise appear the form loaded with ajax and  if the apprise response is true i call ajaxSubmit
[13:46:18] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Would your use case allow you to use radio buttons instead? That would probably make life easier since you'd have individual inputs and labels to reference.
[13:46:35] <nitrospectide> QueueQueue: I had already done the Resources tab‚Ä¶ so I guess I *did* know how. Wasn't sure if that meant it was just linked or actually loaded.
[13:47:31] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: there are a ton of options radio buttons are a nil
[13:47:38] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Gotcha.
[13:48:04] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Can you describe at a higher level what you're trying to do based on the selected option?
[13:48:22] <jeffsmykil> oh I have a service call that takes two parameters
[13:48:31] <jeffsmykil> so I need to embed both parameters in the option
[13:48:36] <QueueQueue> Hor1zon is the ajaxSubmit method being called? If you put in console logs or an alert the line before is that being reached?
[13:48:37] <jeffsmykil> so when I switch to it I can make the call
[13:49:33] <FunnyLookinHat> Ok - when draggable jqueryui stuff - I want to create an image and have that follow the mouse cursor as the user drags ( i.e. "Add me to a list" contextual helper ) - is there an easy way to do that?
[13:49:34] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: ‚Ä¶ kinda ugly, but could you embed the params in the value? Maybe hyphen-separated so you could split them in a separate operation.
[13:49:49] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: that was my next step
[13:50:00] <Hor1zon> QueueQueue, yes it is called
[13:50:01] <jeffsmykil> ugly minds think alike warrenparsons
[13:50:02] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Yeah, sorry, but option doesn't leave you with a lot of options :P
[13:50:19] <Hor1zon> but it can't find in the dom the id of the form cause it was loaded by ajax
[13:51:02] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: I do appreciate your help
[13:51:10] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: The only other approach that comes to mind is building a fake drop down, but that only really works if your site is already using custom appearances for real selects.
[13:51:23] <jeffsmykil> we are on some things
[13:51:32] <jeffsmykil> so i might end up recoding this in li's
[13:51:39] <jeffsmykil> which would be par for the course
[13:51:45] <Vespakoen> Hey guys, can somebody help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/9/  (Sortable / draggable / ?.) =)
[13:51:53] <jeffsmykil> I personally hate custom dropdowns
[13:52:00] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Yeah, I've done that before. Usually not for such an aggravating reason, though.
[13:52:13] <Vespakoen> So i can drop items on the 2 boxes, but i cant move them from one box to another
[13:54:29] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: fun with regex next!
[13:54:31] <nitrospectide> OK. Got it sorted in #drupal-support
[13:54:35] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: yipee!
[13:54:35] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Ha!
[13:54:57] <nitrospectide> Apparently, drupal uses jQuery's .noConflict and de-assigns the $
[13:55:33] <warrenparsons> nitrospectide: Just the sort of thing you figure out after 6 hours of banging your head against a brick wall because it's not well-documented.
[13:55:50] <nitrospectide> so the choice was to either start using jQuery() or wrap my code to assign the $ on the fly
[13:55:56] <cybersholt> ha so i was right in saying try jQuery('div')   :)
[13:56:05] <Vespakoen> nvm, got it, connectWith =)
[13:56:05] <nveid> k.. Haven't another issue it seems..  jQuery(object).closest('tr').siblings('td','.DATA_FIELD').html() is returning null.  line 37 of http://pastebin.com/pAmibMey
[13:56:20] <nitrospectide> :|
[13:56:25] <nitrospectide> LOL
[13:56:32] <nveid> however.. .DATA_FIELD IS a child class of the element its being worked on
[13:56:37] <nveid> as I verified on line 36 of that code
[13:56:38] <QueueQueue> Hor1zon: I found out what seems to be your issue, just coming up with a solution. Bare with me
[13:56:38] <nitrospectide> cybersholt: QueueQueue: Thanks
[13:56:58] <cybersholt> no problem bro good luck with everything

[14:04:11] <nexion> is there an expected delay after doing .append() before the height of the element can be retrieved accurately? I'm getting different heights for the exact same append depending on how long I wait (0-20ms vs 30+ ms) after doing the .append
[14:04:37] <QueueQueue> Hor1zon if you know what the id of the button being generated in, in your ajax sucess (where you append the form html), just bind to the click of the button right after you dump in the html... However if the form is validated... I suppose that would cause an issue with that method. I am not sure what type of form you're using in this context.
[14:04:54] <ravenzz> Es0teric mhmhh?
[14:04:56] <ravenzz> :p
[14:05:11] <ravenzz> can you at least provide us the markup?
[14:05:21] <Es0teric> sure, ravenzz ‚Ä¶ i'll pastie it
[14:05:29] <ravenzz> jsfiddle.net
[14:05:41] <Es0teric> alright
[14:05:48] <QueueQueue> Hor1zon: however, the key element here is just make sure you're binding that submit button which calls ajaxSubmit AFTER the form append and you should be good :)
[14:06:13] <dangerousdave> whats the best way to set the "top" property of an element please?
[14:06:47] <QueueQueue> dangerousdave: $('#elementName').css('top', '10');
[14:06:49] <ravenzz> dangerousdave .css({ top: value}) ?
[14:07:02] <QueueQueue> either or
[14:07:03] <QueueQueue>  :)
[14:07:09] <nveid> anyone mind taking a look at this: http://pastebin.com/Z1j9ygud
[14:07:16] <nveid> line 37 isn't working correctly
[14:07:23] <theBrettman> who else is a fast host for jquery/jquery-ui other than googleapis cuz github is faster than googleapis now... googleapis is slow anymore
[14:07:39] <nveid> .DATA_FIELD is a valid child class created in the table on line 8
[14:07:49] <dangerousdave> thanks guys
[14:07:52] <nveid> but I'm getting a null
[14:07:56] <chee> nitrospectide: it's impossible to tell
[14:08:01] <tw2113> self host theBrettman
[14:08:17] <theBrettman> x10hosting is slow too, lol
[14:08:23] <theBrettman> that's what I use for now
[14:09:02] <theBrettman> and my local development server is taking 500-600ms in waiting to load pages...
[14:09:06] <theBrettman> not sure what's going on with that
[14:09:22] <theBrettman> guess I need to reinstall openSUSE
[14:10:54] <tucan> hey, i tried to add Thickbox to my site and for some reason it's showing at the bottom left of the page, could someone take a look?
[14:11:24] <QueueQueue> tucan: link it
[14:11:54] <tucan> http://www.chinesedictionary.org/
[14:12:24] <tucan> when you click one of the chinese images, i want it to do a Thickbox
[14:12:40] <tucan> but it's showing up at the way bottom left
[14:14:10] <QueueQueue> tucan: you should use colorbox as thickbox is deprecated, but I will look into your issue. Give me a few
[14:14:20] <tucan> ok thanks
[14:14:25] <nveid> ahh.. found out children() works better than siblings
[14:15:53] <stalecache> tucan: I think you're missing the CSS file thickbox comes with?
[14:16:37] <tucan> oh let me add that real quick
[14:17:15] <QueueQueue> #tucan are you including the thickbox css? I don't see it on your page
[14:17:24] <Es0teric> ravenzz -> http://jsfiddle.net/LNKfD/4/
[14:17:27] <tucan> refresh now
[14:17:39] <Hor1zon> QueueQueue, it works, i love you now.
[14:18:08] <QueueQueue> <3 glad it works Hor1zon :)
[14:18:50] <baubbelayponge> tucan, i get a 404 for the css
[14:19:13] <tucan> reallly?
[14:19:26] <tucan> cuz for my i did view source and see it
[14:19:33] <QueueQueue> I see it not being loaded
[14:19:39] <ravenzz> Es0teric 1st of all you forgot to include jQuery there
[14:19:42] <stalecache> tucan, /css/thickbox.css is a 404
[14:20:00] <QueueQueue> you only have chinesedictionary.css in your css directory
[14:20:01] <Es0teric> ravenzz, oops‚Ä¶ lol
[14:20:14] <Es0teric> ravenzz -> http://jsfiddle.net/LNKfD/5/ jquery included
[14:20:52] <ravenzz> anyway what is the purpose of using a submit button without having a form?
[14:21:13] <QueueQueue> specifically a submit button, or a button in general?
[14:21:24] <ravenzz> both
[14:21:31] <QueueQueue> well, you can attach events to a button
[14:21:33] <QueueQueue> that do other things
[14:21:37] <QueueQueue> other than submit
[14:21:40] <tucan> oh crap
[14:21:42] <ravenzz> that is semantically wrong man
[14:21:42] <tucan> sorry
[14:21:50] <sviatovigt> how can I use find on an $.ajax html response without adding the response to the page?
[14:21:52] <QueueQueue> it works tucan!
[14:21:52] <tucan> i uploaded the css and now it works
[14:21:53] <QueueQueue> yay!: )
[14:21:55] <tucan> thanks
[14:21:56] <Es0teric> ravenzz, this is just for rest purposes‚Ä¶ the submit btn is a placeholder - i actually have a image on the real site
[14:21:57] <tucan> :)
[14:23:12] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: you'd have to search the response. It depends on what you're searching for though.
[14:23:41] <ravenzz> Es0teric so what are you trying to do? Do you want to change the wrkwrk text on mouse enter?
[14:23:44] <QueueQueue> What would you be looking for in your scenario?
[14:23:45] <sviatovigt> and how can I search inside it?
[14:24:04] <ravenzz> and set it back to the original value on mouse out?
[14:24:05] <Es0teric> ravenzz, yes - and change it back to the text <p> contains on mouseout
[14:24:11] <ravenzz> k
[14:24:11] <Es0teric> yes, ravenzz
[14:24:17] <sviatovigt> I use jquery/ajax to load a form and save it
[14:24:41] <ravenzz> Es0teric that's pretty simple, I can't believe that you don't get it :P
[14:24:47] <sviatovigt> after the form is saved, I use ajax again to load a template that will hold the data previously saved
[14:24:59] <sviatovigt> in that template I look for some elements using the id
[14:25:08] <sviatovigt> in order to add the html content
[14:25:08] <Es0teric> ravenzz, i have been coding in php for the past 2 weeks.. i almost essentially forgot how to do the simple shit in jquery lol
[14:25:22] <sviatovigt> after the template is filled in with the form data
[14:25:27] <sviatovigt> I will add it to the page
[14:25:51] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt, it is kind of a 'hacky' method, but you can append it to a div that his hidden
[14:25:57] <QueueQueue> *that is
[14:26:10] <sviatovigt> I have already thought of that
[14:26:12] <ravenzz> Es0teric ahah np I wasn't complaining about that. It is more about logic. Hold on
[14:26:19] <sviatovigt> but... isn't there an easier way?
[14:27:08] <QueueQueue> since the response is just a string and has dom presence you can't grab elements as objects
[14:27:16] <QueueQueue> *and has no
[14:27:20] <QueueQueue> (can't type today sorry)
[14:27:39] <pflock> ,can anyone tell me why this isn't executed by the browser? http://pastie.org/3423451
[14:28:41] <jpk> Quick question: Are jquery's DOM manipulations asynchronous, or do they block?
[14:28:55] <sviatovigt> is there a way to add it to the DOM in a different way than by adding it in a hidden element?
[14:29:14] <tucan> QueueQueue: you recommend Colorbox over Thickbox?
[14:29:20] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: you would have to look up a means to parse out html tags and append them
[14:30:08] <erichynds> jpk: sync
[14:30:12] <QueueQueue> tucan: ive used colorbox and like it. It's not a HUGE deal if you have thickbox implemented and working now though. It's just no longer supported
[14:31:02] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: look around for html parsing scripts. I don't have any on hand unfortunately :(
[14:31:03] <tucan> QueueQueue: will Thickbox break in any of the new browsers
[14:31:08] <paul_irish> chovy: around bro?
[14:31:46] <QueueQueue> tucan: I've had no issues with browser compatibility. Honestly though, the link to colorbox is right on the thickbox page. Just load it up and try it in different browsers to verify for yourself  :)
[14:32:43] <QueueQueue> sviatovigt: you can try this... I haven't used it so I can't speak to how effective it is     http://ejohn.org/blog/pure-javascript-html-parser/
[14:32:43] <tucan> ok :)
[14:33:12] <ravenzz> Es0teric something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ujFfE/ i guess
[14:34:35] <Es0teric> HAAAAA, ravenzz ‚Ä¶ paper mario, dope
[14:35:09] <ravenzz> yeah ;D
[14:35:55] <QueueQueue> I always get dc'd from freenode irc channels :(
[14:36:18] <sviatovigt> QueueQueue: that link might work, but I can't use it
[14:36:29] <sviatovigt> that is only for isolated cases
[14:36:46] <sviatovigt> in my case it will be a little bit difficult
[14:37:10] <awkward> CORS or JSONP?
[14:37:17] <QueueQueue> Yeah unfortunately I don't know all the details of what you're trying to do, sorry :(
[14:37:33] <ravenzz> Es0teric what are you going to do on hover? what will be inside the so called p.info ?
[14:37:47] <sviatovigt> that link is good to remember
[14:38:06] <ravenzz> awkward depend on your needs
[14:38:20] <Es0teric> well, ravenzz‚Ä¶ this is all for a week calendar i am building.. so i want it to do something like "edit event" and i'll have a pencil icon and a x icon next to it
[14:38:33] <ravenzz> awkward the cors could be easier
[14:38:38] <Es0teric> but all the data is displayed in php, of course
[14:38:50] <awkward> i guess JSONP appears to be more of a hack whereas CORS will probably continue to have good support as browser implementations move to support it
[14:39:34] <ravenzz> Es0teric so why don't you put anything in your markup and just hide/show these "children" in css?
[14:40:00] <Es0teric> ravenzz, i am going to do that if js is turned off...
[14:40:13] <ravenzz> Es0teric basically your application should work if js is disabled or your script is broken
[14:40:37] <Es0teric> ravenzz, right...
[14:40:43] <ravenzz> eh so what is the advantage of using js?
[14:40:47] <ravenzz> effects?
[14:40:54] <Es0teric> ravenzz exactly
[14:41:01] <ravenzz> css3 is sweet :o
[14:41:08] <Es0teric> and i also want to ajaxify the data
[14:41:28] <ravenzz> and you can use modernizr to detect the non-supported features, so you can polyfill them in js
[14:42:02] <Es0teric> ravenzz, i can do what now?
[14:42:18] <ravenzz> mh yes
[14:42:29] <ravenzz> http://www.modernizr.com/
[14:42:59] <Es0teric> OH SNAP
[14:43:06] <Es0teric> ravenzz:
[14:43:40] <QueueQueue> You know, I haven't really used modernizr... I understand what it does; but how reliable is it?
[14:45:03] <ravenzz> i think that my code is less reliable than the modernizr one
[14:56:29] <paul_irish> QueueQueue: 99% of the attempts to write a detect for localStorage have been wrong. Modernizr's detect is the only one that works
[14:56:40] <a_L_p> I am trying to wrap specific text within a div with a span tag, I am using the contains: selector and wrap() but to no avail. can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong?
[14:56:41] <a_L_p> http://jsfiddle.net/42jHh/
[14:56:58] <a_L_p> I am bring to wrap the word brown in a span in that example
[14:58:40] <adac> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/Typ7t/4/ (notice the behaviour of the menu)
[14:58:49] <Superbiff> Hey all.. I admit to being a bit noob to jQuery / JSON but I'm a non-idiot (coded for a long time) and have hit a snag trying to use an API (petfinder) that is driving me insane.. I've experimented and googled like mad but am stuck.. is it cool to ask in here or am I in the wrong spot
[15:01:05] <adac> j #javascript
[15:06:54] <GoSox> is <input disabled="disabled"> still the HTML5 valid way to disable a field?
[15:07:07] <paul_irish> ya
[15:07:10] <GoSox> i know that doesn't sound like a query question, but it is because i'm trying to disable a whole forum in jq
[15:07:28] <GoSox> good good
[15:08:15] <GoSox> can you add an attribute without a value, with query?
[15:08:25] <GoSox> autocorrect is killing me
[15:08:38] <GoSox> jQuery
[15:10:06] <Superbiff> here's a long shot.. has anyone here ever used the Petfinder API via jQuery/JSON .. I have a bug driving me insane that I know has to be something stupid I just can't find.. I'd happily paypal someone $20 to fix it :P
[15:14:19] <nickelnick_> superbiff, i would be willing to take a look at it for you
[15:14:27] <nickelnick_> if you can wait about an hour for me to get off work
[15:14:48] <nickelnick_> i'm pretty poor so i could use the cash anyways
[15:15:06] <Superbiff> I'll leave the window open and you can PM me.. at this rate I don't know that I'll have it fixed.. I know generally people say "just ask your question" but I don't have enough background to explain it well and didn't want to spam the room
[15:15:21] <nickelnick_> we can skype? do you havce that?
[15:15:25] <Superbiff> I'm serious about the paypal too; I'm 36 not 12 .. time is worth $$ to me
[15:15:27] <nickelnick_> add me on nickeltyme
[15:15:32] <nickelnick_> cool, no prob im also 30
[15:15:47] <nickelnick_> i feel the same about my time
[15:16:06] <nickelnick_> did you add me on skype?
[15:17:03] <Superbiff> just installed skype .. working on that.. I'm an IM person generally
[15:17:31] <doc|work> hello, I have a <select> against which I'm trying to register a $('.selectclass').on('change', function_name); I'm trying to do this where I'd normally use live, as dynamic elements are created by the ui. It doesn't seem to be triggering. Is there some gotcha I'm missing?
[15:17:46] <doc|work> I've read the docs and it should be working I think
[15:21:08] <QueueQueue> Sorry got dc'd, not sure if you got my msg... doc can you show code?
[15:24:44] <paul_irish> QueueQueue: you saw my response to you?
[15:25:09] <doc|work> QueueQueue: will do, one sec
[15:25:50] <paul_irish> ok good :)
[15:26:49] <doc|work> QueueQueue: http://pastebin.ca/2120263
[15:27:17] <doc|work> also, if anyone has any recommendations of a better way to generate the content I'm all ears
[15:30:07] <tripodman> http://jsfiddle.net/TKDwP/2/, i can't get my callbacks to fire off right, can someone take a look for me?
[15:30:41] <QueueQueue> doc: looking into it now; gimmie a few
[15:30:48] <doc|work> QueueQueue: thanks
[15:33:59] <QueueQueue> doc, planner_id is an empty div on the page?
[15:34:48] <doc|work> QueueQueue: nope, it's a select which has two options with appropriate values. I'm seeing 'attach' in the console as I'd expect from line 31.
[15:36:37] <QueueQueue> so planner_id and condition_select are both drop downs?
[15:37:01] <doc|work> QueueQueue: tjat
[15:37:03] <doc|work> bah
[15:37:04] <QueueQueue> nvm, I see
[15:37:06] <doc|work> QueueQueue: that's right
[15:37:34] <tripodman> mmm i actually got it
[15:39:53] <QueueQueue> are there multiple condition_select classed elements on the page ?
[15:41:19] <QueueQueue> Because you're attaching an event to elements with the class condition_select prior to that element being created it seems.
[15:41:35] <doc|work> QueueQueue: yep, my understanding is on replaces live(). Is that wrong?
[15:43:18] <QueueQueue> agh, sorry keep getting disconnected! :(
[15:43:23] <doc|work> hehe :)
[15:43:32] <QueueQueue> Did you say anything after my last msg?
[15:43:33] <doc|work> repeat: QueueQueue: yep, my understanding is on replaces live(). Is that wrong?
[15:43:41] <doc|work> *on()
[15:43:45] <QueueQueue> you're not wrong
[15:43:54] <doc|work> so it should work, shouldn't it?
[15:43:58] <QueueQueue> however did you see what I had said about the event being bound prior to creation?
[15:44:09] <QueueQueue> not sure if that went through before dcing
[15:44:51] <doc|work> QueueQueue: isn't live() / on() supposed to add to any elements that match from that point on?
[15:44:58] <QueueQueue> When you bind the event with $('.condition_select').on('change',condition_change);    it doesn't mean that will apply to all dom elements created after that point
[15:45:00] <doc|work> add as in attach anevent
[15:45:30] <doc|work> ".live(): Attach an event handler for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future."
[15:46:20] <doc|work> does on differ from live in that sense?
[15:47:11] <doc|work> oh, now I see
[15:47:26] <doc|work> "To ensure the elements are present and can be selected, perform event binding inside a document ready handler for elements that are in the HTML markup on the page."
[15:48:20] <doc|work> that's not a great replacement if you have a significant part of the interface generated in js :/ I'll have to match on an item way up the dom and then delegate to the select :/
[15:48:48] <doc|work>  /win 3
[15:48:53] <doc|work> oops
[15:50:09] <doc|work> ok, yeah, that works
[15:50:25] <doc|work> it needed to be: $('#planner_rules').on('change','select.condition_select',condition_change);
[15:51:54] <QueueQueue> Yeah. See, I think live would work in this situation, however i've heard it's "less efficient" I often times bind events to elements as I create them
[15:51:57] <QueueQueue> but to each thier own I suppose
[15:52:07] <QueueQueue> as well as on
[15:52:35] <doc|work> QueueQueue: yeah, I would too, but means not being able to bulk generate the content if I do that. Supposedly quicker.
[15:53:03] <doc|work> and live() is deprecated :/
[15:53:08] <nitrospectide> http://pastie.org/3423120 what is the jQuery syntax to style the <a> tag in the <li> that comes after the <li> with the <a> that has the .active class?
[15:54:23] <QueueQueue> so adding 'select.condition_select' resolved it all for you?
[15:54:32] <doc|work> $('li>a.active').parent().siblings('li').next().find('a') should get the dom element for you
[15:54:38] <doc|work> nitrospectide: ^
[15:54:47] <doc|work> I'm not sure that's the most efficient way though
[15:56:28] <nitrospectide> doc|work: trying now...
[15:56:39] * ryanneufeld waves at coldhead
[15:56:47] <doc|work> nitrospectide: if that doesn't work, I recommend reading the docs about traversing.
[15:56:59] * chee burns both ryanneufeld and coldhead with acid
[15:57:06] * coldhead vibrates in terror
[15:57:10] <doc|work> actually, even if it does I recommend reading it. It's important.
[15:57:25] <ryanneufeld> hey, chee, guess what?
[15:57:30] <chee> what!
[15:57:32] <ryanneufeld> fuck you
[15:57:34] <ryanneufeld> that's what
[15:57:36] <chee> :<
[15:57:56] <ryanneufeld> burn me with acid, that shit hurts dude
[15:58:07] <ryanneufeld> hurts me in the feelbads
[15:58:28] <chee> itw as a typo i meant to say 'gives ice-cream'
[15:58:52] <chee> but waever if you don't want the ice cream then i will eat the icecream
[15:59:23] <ryanneufeld> chee: oh, yeah common typo, happens all time
[15:59:24] <nitrospectide> doc|work: that actually applies it to everything BUT the one I want
[15:59:50] <doc|work> nitrospectide: erm, it should just be getting the one after the active one
[16:00:06] <coldhead> today is pizza day
[16:00:14] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: how you been lately?
[16:00:21] <ryanneufeld> I haven't been around much lately
[16:00:24] <doc|work> nitrospectide: if not, it's time to spend some quality time with the docs :)
[16:01:03] <nitrospectide> doc|work: This is what I used: http://pastie.org/3423868
[16:02:42] <coldhead> yeah we missed you ryry
[16:02:48] <doc|work> nitrospectide: try it without the siblings('li')
[16:02:52] <coldhead> i've been experimenting with backbone
[16:03:02] <coldhead> and jsonp from wikipedia
[16:03:27] <coldhead> DID YOU EVEN KNOW WIKIPEDIA SERVED PAGES VIA JSONP!?
[16:05:37] <Soopaman> coldhead: as in you can get the page in jsonp rather than markup?
[16:06:27] <coldhead> as in any page anywhere can request wikipedia content via ajax
[16:06:43] <coldhead> no mess, no fuss
[16:09:12] <diverdude> Is it expensive to check if a jquery-node has been appended to <body>?
[16:10:05] <nitrospectide> doc|work: dropping the siblings does it!
[16:12:10] <doc|work> nitrospectide: win!
[16:12:38] <nitrospectide> doc|work ++
[16:13:56] <ndss56> diverdude: what do you mean by expensive?
[16:17:57] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: NO I DID NOT KNOW IT SERVED PAGES IN JSONP!!! BUT THAT'S AWESOME
[16:18:41] <chee> yes it really is so awesome
[16:20:38] <ndss56> what is jsonp?
[16:24:46] <coldhead> ndss56: cross domain ajax
[16:25:00] <coldhead> ?w jsonp
[16:25:01] <bot-t> coldhead, JSONP - JSONP or "JSON with padding" is a complement to the base JavaScript Object Notation JSON data format, a pattern of usage allowing a page to request data from a server in a different domain. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[16:25:18] <ndss56> coldhead: what do you mean cross domain?
[16:25:52] <coldhead> a page at foo.com can request data via ajax at wikipedia.org
[16:25:56] <coldhead> you can't usually do that
[16:25:59] <Superbiff> ffs.. 4 hours to debug the fact that I forgot a stinking $
[16:26:04] <coldhead> unless the remote domain supports jsonp
[16:26:10] <Superbiff> #headexplodes
[16:26:10] <coldhead> and when it does, whoo mamma
[16:26:22] <coldhead> you won't do that again at least, Superbiff :D
[16:26:48] <coldhead> watch out for guns
[16:26:48] <Superbiff> yea really.. you never forget stuff like that.. er.. well, we like to say that, until the next time we do assignment instead of comparison and then debug it and start throwing things
[16:26:50] <coldhead> watch out for girls
[16:26:53] <thenior> quick question.. if I have several elements with the same CLASS, how can I get the numerical value for one of them? For instance, if I clicked the third one, return 3 etc
[16:27:03] <ndss56> coldhead: you mean foo.com request data from server1 that retrieves it from wiki.org?
[16:27:13] <coldhead> no, that's the point ndss56 !
[16:27:17] <coldhead> no server1 required!
[16:27:30] <Superbiff> yea that would be a cross-cross-domain
[16:27:51] <coldhead> the wikipedia article explains it well
[16:28:21] <Superbiff> cross-domain calls are cool but XSS attacks are still a thorn
[16:28:25] <ndss56> coldhead: if you know wiki.org ip u can connect anyway so whats the point?
[16:30:20] <chee> client side data request, with ajax, ndss56.
[16:30:50] <ndss56> ok
[16:30:58] <coldhead> ndss56: even if you have the IP of wikipedia, you can't load the article about Freemasonry into your page without JSONP
[16:31:06] <chee> or the list of latin phrases
[16:31:16] <coldhead> OR THE LIST OF LATIN PHRASES
[16:31:26] <coldhead> THAT WOULD BE AN IDEAL SE
[16:31:27] <chee> coldhead: i just had a great idea for an app
[16:31:28] <coldhead> USE*
[16:31:38] <thenior> (psst, friendly bump): if I had 3 elements with the class "myClass", how could I get jquery to return "2" when I click the 2nd one (or "3" if I click the third etc)
[16:31:46] <ndss56> u can write a script to connect to any domain and retrieve anything
[16:32:00] <coldhead> ?index @ thenior
[16:32:00] <ndss56> anyway, i got to run and get lunch
[16:32:00] <bot-t> thenior, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[16:32:05] <ndss56> bye
[16:32:10] <coldhead> bye ndss56 !
[16:32:32] <coldhead> ignore bot-t, thenior, there is another sense of index() that should do what you want
[16:33:01] <NackNick> can someone help me, i keep getting this error on one page but the validator works on my other pages this is the error "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'validate'"
[16:33:16] <thenior> coldhead: thx, I'll look into that
[16:33:22] <NackNick> and the script is being called on the page
[16:33:28] <NackNick> so im not sure why im getting the error
[16:33:55] <Amanda19> hi, i need newsletter popup script
[16:33:59] <Amanda19> any idea where to get it?
[16:34:44] <thenior> Amanda19: ... a newsletter popup script? Any details?
[16:35:25] <Amanda19> when a user comes to the site, a popup comes up where it says to leave name, email
[16:35:28] <adac> How can I access this array from a div? http://jsfiddle.net/zwPtQ/
[16:37:22] <c_t_montgomery> adac: do you mean $(".fetched-page-picture-aray").text()? not sure exactly what you're trying to do there
[16:38:20] <thenior> Amanda19: try http://www.thesimplexdesign.com/2011/02/using-jquery-to-make-one-time.html
[16:39:22] <adac> c_t_montgomery, well basically this a hidden div that contains paths to images. and i need to read in those paths into a java array
[16:39:27] <ryanneufeld> http://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart?feature=g-all-esi#p/u/1/a5z-OEIfw3s
[16:39:50] <Amanda19> thenioe, exactly
[16:40:00] <Amanda19> but is there a better looking one?
[16:40:28] <thenior_> Amanda19: you can always reskin one
[16:43:51] <c_t_montgomery> adac: ah, no worries. just use var array_of_paths = $(".fetched-page-picture-array").html() - that will store the array of images in array_of_paths, and from there, you can do the work you need to with java
[16:45:37] <erichynds> c_t_montgomery: getters only return the value for the first element in a site
[16:50:18] <kristofer91> Hey guys, i made a tab sort of menu, and what i am trying to do is when someone clicked the 1st out 3 tabs there is, i want it to have an active state
[16:50:22] <kristofer91> 	  	jQuery("#selected").appendTo(jQuery("#feature1"));
[16:50:26] <kristofer91> shouldn't this do the trick ?
[16:50:48] <kkuno> hi
[16:51:44] <kkuno> I need to change page with ajax... I always used   the hashtag. Now I want to use additionally the hashtag for its real purpose :P
[16:51:55] <kkuno> for jumping to a part of the page
[16:52:06] <kkuno> like    #page#jump-id
[16:52:10] <kkuno> how can I do this?
[16:53:01] <Eviltwin> You can't unless the <A>'s are named with the page and jump ID
[16:53:05] <Eviltwin> You'd have to fake it
[16:53:39] <Superbiff> here's an odd one.. I have a $.getJSON that retrieves back a set of data from an API (petfinder).. For each of them it calls a function that builds a display row of the appropriate data. Once it has the result, it displays it. That function in turn calls a different JSON (one of the values requires a separate lookup using the ID) which it builds into the string of row data it returns.. What is odd is that it is displaying all of t
[16:53:58] <Superbiff> then those columns start appearing one by one.. since I'm doing all this in the callback function, I would have thought it would wait?
[16:54:03] <kkuno> Eviltwin, so it's impossible?
[16:54:29] <Eviltwin> Well you could do http://server/page#jump-id
[16:54:40] <Eviltwin> Or http://server/#page-jump-id
[16:54:50] <Eviltwin> Have your page recognize how to pick that apart
[16:54:55] <Eviltwin> So that it can find "page" and show the right content
[16:55:18] <Eviltwin> And either have your <A> be <A name="page-jump-id"> instead of <A name="jump-id">
[16:55:22] <Eviltwin> Or fake it
[16:55:27] <Eviltwin> Use JavaScript to scroll them there
[16:55:31] <Eviltwin> Those are your choices
[16:55:42] <Eviltwin> The hash wasn't really designed for what modern AJAX sites do
[16:55:46] <Eviltwin> It was just a simple way to implement it
[16:55:50] <kkuno> evident, but in this case I have to jump using javascript, instead of the builtin browser function
[16:55:55] <kkuno> ok
[16:56:22] <kkuno> the browser should not be able to sprate #page-jump-id on its own
[16:56:23] <Eviltwin> If you insist on calling it "jump-id" in the <A> tag but not having #jump-id be the hash, then yes...
[16:56:36] <Eviltwin> So you can either not do one of those things
[16:56:41] <Eviltwin> Or use JavaScript
[16:57:05] <Eviltwin> What the hash was intended for was nagivation within the page pre-JavaScript
[16:57:13] <Eviltwin> We have JavaScript now, we can use it
[16:58:57] <kkuno> well, I was looking at google+, and it doesn't use hashtag to change page with ajax
[16:59:12] <kkuno> I need to document about it
[17:00:07] <Eviltwin> It's called pushState
[17:00:08] <rmurphey> kkuno: they are probably using pushstate
[17:00:10] <Eviltwin> And it's only in modern browsers
[17:00:25] <kkuno> mmh ok
[17:00:40] <Eviltwin> Most large AJAXy sites use it now but with a fallback on hash or traditional navigation (or in most cases, both)
[17:01:25] <coldhead> if anyone has any questions on what DOM stands for, snover is happy to help out
[17:02:31] <Eviltwin> Something about a bunch of women modeling clothes while men treat them like objects and document the results?
[17:02:58] * doc|work wants that job
[17:03:27] <Eviltwin> I thought that's what a Document Object Model gig was
[17:12:38] <kristofer91> Eviltwin
[17:12:48] <kristofer91> is there any other ways for what i am trying to do, or am i just doing it wrong or something
[17:13:21] <kristofer91> I basically have 3 tabs, and i want that when one is clicked it's in an active mode, so that the css changes it, i mean you know what i mean
[17:13:39] <kristofer91> 	  	jQuery("#selected").appendTo(jQuery("#feature1"));
[17:13:44] <kristofer91> somehow this isn't working
[17:14:13] <abjorn> IMSKY MY WIGGLA
[17:15:48] <rmurphey> kristofer91: why not just add a class to the clicked tab, rather than adding an element to it?
[17:18:45] <rmurphey> kristofer91: like http://jsfiddle.net/Kwh2C/
[17:24:32] <kristofer91> Thanks rmurphey
[17:24:43] <kristofer91> although i'm just using a div, not a li
[17:24:48] <kristofer91>  ichanged to p just to test it works
[17:24:54] <kristofer91> ,but im trying to make it if a div is clicked
[17:25:06] <kristofer91> what would i need to put instead of the li
[17:25:57] <rmurphey> kristofer91: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:29:52] <kristofer91> hum while going over it i saw this : toggleClass
[17:30:03] <kristofer91> Shouldn't this work also for what i am trying ?

[19:30:00] <Axium> Hi all, any ideas on grabbing an element and its next N siblings in one selector? getting confused trying to make that happen with nextAll()
[19:36:14] <mutedia> hey, what's the proper event to bind for a page that is loaded through a form.submit() function?
[19:36:47] <kborchers> crankharder: that height is enforced on resize, you need to use the height option

[19:50:50] <anth0ny> Just learning JS/jQuery here, making a simple image gallery.  How would I bind a function to run when an image changes display from "hidden" to "visible"?
[19:50:51] <JBP641> any help?
[19:51:13] <imsky> abjorn: i don't like em either
[19:51:20] <imsky> they look great in photos
[19:51:29] <imsky> but when you start using them, everything falls apart
[19:52:58] <abjorn> yeeeaah
[19:53:22] <imsky> case in point, try to select parts of a string using modifier keys
[19:53:49] <imsky> apple-shift-left works for the whole string
[19:53:57] <imsky> but can you guess what makes it go word-by-word?
[19:54:05] <abjorn> absolutely nothing
[19:54:14] <imsky> option-shift-left
[19:54:21] <abjorn> OSX just neglects the oddest features that you never think you're gonna miss until it's gone.
[19:54:25] <abjorn> Like...locking the fucking computer.
[19:54:30] <imsky> and finder sucks
[19:54:38] <abjorn> oh god yes it does
[19:54:47] <abjorn> windows 7 file manager is better :\
[19:54:55] <imsky> it's even better than linux file managers
[19:55:02] <imsky> which is ridiculous
[19:55:03] <abjorn> lol
[19:56:31] <imsky> i customize it pretty hardcore tho
[19:57:24] <imsky> for fun, do option-apple-space

[20:02:33] <Amanda19> hi
[20:02:43] <Amanda19> i want to use pop up optin email

[20:02:50] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org/popup/
[20:02:58] <Amanda19> i would collect users emails
[20:03:22] <Amanda19> does anybody know how is it possible to delete text when user clicks inside the email box
[20:03:32] <Amanda19> now you have to select it and delete it
[20:03:42] <Amanda19> i just want user to click inside and the text would be deleted
[20:03:57] <Amanda19> for example in the box that says Ime in priimek
[20:04:02] <Amanda19> "Ime in priimek"

[20:06:12] <Amanda19> you can do directly in the html?
[20:06:18] <imsky> nope
[20:06:24] <imsky> you...could use html5 placeholder

[20:07:14] <Amanda19> wow
[20:07:20] <Amanda19> that placeholder looks nice
[20:07:32] <imsky> unlike windows, where winkey+number gives you goddamn apps
[20:07:41] <abjorn> Yes, and 10 years later than it should've been in the standard, Amanda19!
[20:07:42] <imsky> oh shiiit

[20:08:24] <imsky> Amanda19: that's why we use polyfills

[20:20:21] <Amanda19> <input name="email" type="text" placeholder="Vaö email" size="30" />
[20:20:26] <imsky> there ya go
[20:21:06] <angelazou> Hi, I need some help with a script
[20:21:12] <imsky> sure you do
[20:21:17] <angelazou> I'm following this tutorial
[20:21:19] <angelazou> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/12/countdown-jquery/
[20:21:59] <angelazou> to create a countdown, I need to customize it, and I have deleted all files and left with the core jquery.countdown.js
[20:21:59] <imsky> abjorn: you still there?
[20:22:03] <Amanda19> wow it works irmsky
[20:22:18] <Amanda19> will it mess up my form ?
[20:22:20] <angelazou> however, this is very different from the tutorial
[20:22:24] <imsky> no Amanda19
[20:22:32] <angelazou> but I'm not sure where did I go wrong
[20:22:37] <Amanda19> ok
[20:22:49] <angelazou> I made a paste here http://jsfiddle.net/Z4HR3/
[20:22:51] <Amanda19> so how to embed this into my website via popup
[20:23:13] <angelazou> as you can see, the countdown seem to work but it doesn't get the number of days, hours or second
[20:23:24] <angelazou> nor does it get formatted like it should be
[20:23:40] <angelazou> how can I fix this?
[20:23:54] <imsky> lol
[20:24:09] <imsky> little late for me
[20:24:12] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org/popup/  i want this to popup for every user that comes to my site
[20:24:24] <imsky> i'm out abjorn, don't forget the invert colors trick
[20:25:58] <Amanda19> anybody can help?
[20:26:48] <angelazou> oh, I got the css back, see update, http://jsfiddle.net/Z4HR3/1/
[20:27:02] <angelazou> but it's still giving me the na na stuff
[20:28:04] <rmurphey> angelazou: what is $matches?
[20:28:11] <rmurphey> i don't see you defining it anywhere
[20:28:19] <rmurphey> and you're using it inside a string
[20:28:20] <angelazou> oh....
[20:28:22] <rmurphey> so ..
[20:28:34] <Amanda19> guys how to make optin pop up box
[20:28:40] <angelazou> thanks
[20:28:43] <rmurphey> my guess is that you are passing bad arguments to new Date() :)
[20:28:52] <rmurphey> Amanda19: what have you tried?
[20:29:12] <Amanda19> i wanted to do this
[20:29:13] <Amanda19> http://www.thesimplexdesign.com/2011/02/using-jquery-to-make-one-time.html
[20:29:18] <Amanda19> but havent tested it
[20:29:23] <Amanda19> it is for blogger though
[20:29:26] <Amanda19> i have regular site
[20:29:42] <Amanda19> i want each user to get popup newsletter box when he gets to my site
[20:29:56] <Amanda19> another option would be when he tries to leave the site
[20:29:57] <rmurphey> Amanda19: you will have more luck here if you show what you have tried and explain what is not working about it
[20:30:13] <rmurphey> than just asking how to do a fairly broad thing
[20:33:41] <angelazou> rmurphey, is it possible to have jquery or javascript reload a page?
[20:34:05] <angelazou> I want to do some php when that countdown has ended, but I know that since php is serverside
[20:34:29] <angelazou> I can't trigger php with javascript, but if I can reload the page using javascript, I can get php to run, right?
[20:34:46] <rmurphey> ?g reload page with javascript
[20:34:47] <bot-t> rmurphey, How to Reload the Page With JavaScript - http://www.mediacollege.com/internet/javascript/page/reload.html
[20:35:22] <rmurphey> so, their advice to do it with an onclick attribute is terrible
[20:35:53] <rmurphey> sorry
[20:36:08] <rmurphey> window.location.reload()
[20:36:34] <angelazou> that's helpful really, just one more thing, can you tell me which part of script can tell me that the count down has ended?
[20:36:46] <angelazou> i pasted the jquery.countdown.js in the javascript section here http://jsfiddle.net/Z4HR3/2/
[20:36:48] <rmurphey> you'll have to read the plugin :)
[20:37:52] <aviraldg> Hi. The latest jQuery version (from git) seems to be failing almost all tests and it looks like "jQuery" isn't being defined, even though:
[20:37:54] <aviraldg> 1. I have a proper test environment (with PHP) set up
[20:37:56] <aviraldg> 2. jQuery is built fine; tried 'make clean; make' but to no avail.
[20:38:00] <aviraldg> Any idea what might be causing this?
[20:38:36] <aviraldg> *about
[20:38:48] <Eviltwin> I think this is a question for #jquery-dev
[20:56:52] <Amanda19> can somebody tell me how to link to script file in the header?
[21:02:28] <robk> I have a form, with quiz answers in it, these answers can be re-arranged in their order, and they have input boxes in them. when i bind jquery ui sortable() to the answer list, the inputboxes are no longer selectable, can you cannot type anything in the form list anymore.
[21:02:47] <gasull> Why does alert(data) doesn't work at the bottom of this page? http://jsfiddle.net/uehgD/  In Firebug I find the JSON request returns an empty response in JavaScript, but if I reach the URL manually in the browser of with curl I get a JSON dictionary.
[21:03:03] <robk> is it possible to make sortable jquery ui only allow one element in the form to allow you to drag to a different order?
[21:07:59] <Amanda19> ok, my popup works in local server but on website it does not
[21:08:07] <Amanda19> is thee somethign wrong with js?
[21:08:09] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org/popup/
[21:09:04] <snover> not sure if trolling‚Ä¶
[21:09:25] <Amanda19> anybody?
[21:09:45] <Amanda19> i am almost done, just need a little help
[21:10:25] <Cork> ?
[21:10:44] <Cork> whats wrong with the js, might be that there isn't any
[21:10:45] <Es0teric> how do i keep the hoverstate on an element persistent as long as the mouse is over the parent element AFTER hovering over the child element?
[21:11:04] <Amanda19> my popup doe not work
[21:11:07] <Amanda19> can you check the link?
[21:11:32] <Cork> Es0teric: use mouseenter on the element, and mouseleave on the parent
[21:11:46] <Es0teric> AH ok thanks
[21:12:59] <Amanda19> wrong link
[21:13:04] <Amanda19> here it is again http://www.numerologija.org/popup/optin.html
[21:17:42] <Amanda19> ok it works now
[21:19:18] <coldhead> good work Amanda19 !
[21:22:41] <kara_sweets> does anyone know how to grab the value of a form field ? or can identify what's wrong with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/yp39C/
[21:24:06] <Cork> ?.serialize @ kara_sweets
[21:24:06] <bot-t> kara_sweets, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[21:24:23] <Cork> or if you just want the value see ?.val
[21:24:23] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:29:44] <kara_sweets> for some reason serialize isnt using for this situation, so im just gonna try to grab one value in the form, how do i reference the input in relation to $form?
[21:45:28] <Amanda19> how toplaceholder does not show up in iE
[21:45:38] <Amanda19> placeholder is missing in IE
[21:45:40] <Amanda19> what to do?
[21:51:40] <snover> I thought numerology had all the answers
[21:52:55] <coldhead> bot-t: does numerology have all the answers?
[21:52:55] <bot-t> coldhead, It is decidedly so.
[22:00:53] <axium> Hi all, quick question about wrapAll(): I have several siblings that I'm selecting and attempting to wrap with a div
[22:01:17] <palani> hi hi
[22:01:19] <axium> When I grab siblings in the middle, I'm noticing that wrapAll is nuking the siblings before it.. Ie: sib sib sib (  sib sib sib )
[22:01:21] <palani> gud morning
[22:01:53] <axium> curious if I need to be taking a different approach
[22:02:47] <palani> pls any 1 help me.........when ever click the side bar link that time selected link ill be highlighted????????
[22:06:01] <palani> using jquery function
[22:11:34] <palani> pls any 1 help me.........when ever click the side bar link that time selected link ill be highlighted????????
[22:12:26] <vladikoff> yes.
[22:14:07] <palani> using jquery
[22:15:19] <Es0teric> how do i use .find(":contains('unavailable')") to find the text and grab the whole tag its in?
[22:15:31] <rmurphey> palani: do you mean something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Kwh2C/1/
[22:15:38] <Es0teric> .find("contains:('unavailable')") *
[22:18:12] <coldhead> Es0teric: you don't need to quote unavailable
[22:18:29] <Es0teric> coldhead, alright but how do i grab the whole element its in?
[22:18:55] <coldhead> you want the child-most element with that text?
[22:19:00] <coldhead> not the parents and grandparents?
[22:19:19] <coldhead> INTERESTING
[22:19:45] <Es0teric> sarcasm...
[22:19:52] <tw2113> is awesome
[22:20:20] <Es0teric> coldhead, the text i am looking for is wrapped in a <p> tag, i am trying to get the entire tag w/ all context.. not just the matched word
[22:21:23] <coldhead> there was no sarcasm, switch to decaf
[22:21:46] <coldhead> that selector you have should get you the whole tag
[22:21:57] <coldhead> jQuery doesn't generally operate on individual words
[22:22:09] <coldhead> :contains() selects the dom node which CONTAINS the thing
[22:22:27] <Es0teric> so then why am i just getting the matched word?
[22:23:23] <rmurphey> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/AzEz5/1/
[22:23:26] <rmurphey> i get elements
[22:23:33] <rmurphey> but beware ... i get six of them in that test
[22:24:43] <Es0teric> yeah, i see
[22:24:49] <rmurphey> i would not use :contains if you can avoid it
[22:25:02] <rmurphey> better to put a class on the elements you want to be able to find
[22:25:11] <angelazou> hello, how can I use javascript to highlight all text when clicking on any part of the element?
[22:29:23] <coldhead> angelazou: that needs different code for different browsers, you should find a plugin that does it so you don't have to
[22:29:40] <angelazou> I see, thanks for the info coldhead
[22:38:18] <GoSox> is there an easy (and reliable) way to get a user's time zone?

[22:46:24] <tw2113> oh wait, it is
[22:46:40] <Amanda19> rmurphey? what?
[22:46:49] <easel> hehe, wasn't sure if it was that kind of jquery room, just being polite :)

[22:48:23] <rmurphey> Amanda19: what have you done to try to solve this problem? can you show us the code you've written that isn't working?
[22:48:31] <easel> I'm building a bulk file upload form for a poster printing company and I have got jQuery adding extra fields (width, height, poster_type) for each successfully upload
[22:48:32] <Amanda19> yes it is here
[22:48:34] <rmurphey> hello tw2113
[22:48:36] <Amanda19> it is almost working
[22:48:48] <Amanda19> it does not recognize cookie i think, so it shows up on every page refresh

[22:48:56] <Amanda19> http://www.numerologija.org/
[22:49:00] <Amanda19> this is my site
[22:49:19] <Amanda19> and popup does not have grey transparent background
[22:49:21] <Amanda19> i would like that
[22:49:34] <Amanda19> and the form is not centered
[22:50:01] <easel> each extra field will carry the name "type_{file_id}, width_{file_id}, etc"
[22:50:32] <easel> the type_{file_id} is a radio select
[22:50:47] <Amanda19> please help
[22:50:58] <rmurphey> Amanda19: it does not show up for me when i reload after closing the popup
[22:51:11] <Amanda19> really?
[22:51:11] <easel> I need to fetch all the dynamically created type fields so that I can use them in a calculator to calculate a quote
[22:51:15] <rmurphey> really
[22:51:16] <Amanda19> why it shows up for me?
[22:51:35] <Amanda19> it is only setup on homepage
[22:51:38] <rmurphey> perhaps you need to clear your cache?
[22:51:38] <Amanda19> not on other pages
[22:51:50] <rmurphey> i am on the home page
[22:51:59] <easel> but it's proving challenging because I can't isolate all the radio fields, because they all have different field names
[22:51:59] <Eviltwin> easel: This might help you: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/

[22:58:13] <rmurphey> and more to the point, does the item at the 0 position of the array have a "text" method?
[22:59:28] <Amanda19> it is already position:fixed

[23:00:47] <Es0teric> its harder to make a demo in js
[23:00:48] <Es0teric> than php
[23:00:49] <Es0teric> :|

[23:02:51] <Amanda19> gosox i doubt you even know how to
[23:02:56] <Amanda19> so dont bother
[23:03:29] <GoSox> oh i was just kidding, i was going to help, but if you don't want me to, that's fine too
[23:03:46] <rmurphey> Amanda19: i'm trying very hard to understand how you've found yourself in a situation where the only way you can get this done, urgently, is by repeatedly leaning on total strangers
[23:03:46] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: At some point you're going to have to actually build your own website
[23:03:50] <Eviltwin> Not haev us build it for you
[23:04:08] <Amanda19> i build site myself
[23:04:16] <Amanda19> i am just new to jquery so i ask here
[23:04:32] <rmurphey> you have asked a lot of questions that do not demonstrate that you have made a serious effort at discovering the answers on your own
[23:04:45] <rmurphey> so, please, make a serious effort at discovering the answers on your own
[23:04:52] <rmurphey> read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html and then read it again
[23:04:57] <Es0teric> does jquery have a striptags method?
[23:04:59] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Amanda19
[23:05:00] <bot-t> Amanda19, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[23:05:07] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: Please read through those guides first
[23:05:16] <mindis|wurk> 'scrollable form' also sounds more like a css issue
[23:05:34] <Amanda19> so you dont know how to check css?
[23:05:42] <Amanda19> it should be a very easy task
[23:05:54] <mindis|wurk> there is some sweet irony in that statement
[23:05:58] <rmurphey> indeed
[23:06:03] <GoSox> what is the name for a function that you define "on the spot", like inside the spot where the callback goes, you put function() { statement; } <- what is that kind of function called?
[23:06:18] <rmurphey> anonymous?
[23:06:34] <GoSox> are variables created in anonymous functions global?
[23:06:37] <rmurphey> no
[23:06:44] <rmurphey> not if they're created using the var statement, anyway
[23:06:54] <GoSox> what if they aren't?
[23:07:07] <GoSox> just variableName = value;
[23:07:15] <tw2113> good practice, always use var ?
[23:07:35] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: There's a big difference between what people know and can do and what they're how much time they're willing to waste sharing their knowledge and talents with a complete stranger for no money.
[23:07:43] <rmurphey> then they are scoped to wherever they *were* declared via var, or they are global if they were never declared using var
[23:07:57] <rmurphey> actually that is a confusing statement i just made :)
[23:08:07] <GoSox> i have a variable that is being remembered, which is good because that's what i want, but i don't get why it is working, i thought the variable should be undefined until i do something like make it global
[23:08:18] <Eviltwin> GoSox: You should always use "var" when you instantiate a new variable
[23:08:21] <GoSox> oh ok so i am making globals
[23:08:32] <Eviltwin> If you leave off "var" it goes up the tree of functions to find a reference to it
[23:08:33] <rmurphey> what Eviltwin
[23:08:37] <rmurphey> said
[23:08:40] <Eviltwin> And if there isn't one, it uses global scope
[23:08:40] <rmurphey> always use var
[23:08:48] <Eviltwin> So it becomes less predictable
[23:08:53] <Eviltwin> You need to be more careful about naming
[23:09:00] <GoSox> well i wanted this one to be global after all so it worked out great
[23:09:08] <Eviltwin> If you explicitly want to make something global (usually not a good idea), use window.varname = foo();
[23:09:28] <rmurphey> there is almost always a better answer than using a global
[23:09:39] <Eviltwin> But don't just not put var on it to make it global
[23:09:47] <Eviltwin> That makes the code difficult to read
[23:10:51] <Es0teric> does jquery have a striptags function?
[23:11:39] <Eviltwin> Es0teric: Why?
[23:11:46] <Eviltwin> You're working in JavaScript already
[23:11:51] <Es0teric> because i know what jquery is doing...
[23:11:54] <Eviltwin> Concerns are different
[23:13:11] <Es0teric> jquery is trying to use the .text() method on the <p> element
[23:13:17] <Es0teric> but the <p> element has no method
[23:13:34] <Es0teric> what i REALLY want to do is get the string thats inside the <p> tag
[23:14:00] <Eviltwin> I think you need to see ?learn
[23:14:01] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[23:14:10] <Amanda19> hmm i used this code to show placeholders in ie
[23:14:11] <Amanda19> http://www.hagenburger.net/BLOG/HTML5-Input-Placeholder-Fix-With-jQuery.html
[23:14:21] <Amanda19> i pasted the code in my js file
[23:14:34] <Amanda19> but in ie the placeholder still does not show up
[23:14:34] <rmurphey> Es0teric: given a dom element, there are plenty of ways that you can get its text, using jquery or plain js
[23:14:49] <tw2113> innerHTML ?
[23:14:50] <Eviltwin> .text() is a method of jQuery objects, not DOM elements
[23:14:54] <rmurphey> Amanda19: what have you done to try to solve this problem?
[23:15:05] <Eviltwin> rmurphey: Come running here as fast as possible
[23:15:08] <rmurphey> i.e. have you searched google?
[23:15:20] <tw2113> or duckduckgo?
[23:15:21] <rmurphey> or visited any sites about html5?
[23:15:34] <Amanda19> yes i try to show placeholder text in ie
[23:15:40] <rmurphey> i give up
[23:15:46] <rmurphey> good night everyone, and good luck :)
[23:15:50] <Amanda19> and i pasted the jquery here   http://www.numerologija.org/popup.js
[23:15:53] <tw2113> night rmurphey
[23:16:17] <Amanda19> what have i done to solve the problem, i am asking here on this chat
[23:16:25] <Amanda19> that is what i have done
[23:16:52] <Amanda19> maybe put the big title, dont ask any questions if you are not at least level 10 pagan in WOW
[23:17:10] <rmurphey> Amanda19: so
[23:17:15] * GoSox is a level 12 pagan 
[23:17:16] <rmurphey> you encountered a problem
[23:17:21] <Amanda19> i am not familiar with wow, you probably are
[23:17:21] <rmurphey> and your solution to that problem
[23:17:28] <rmurphey> is to ask strangers to solve it
[23:17:30] <rmurphey> ?
[23:17:32] <Amanda19> are you joking?
[23:17:38] <Amanda19> yes that is what the chat is for right?
[23:17:47] <rmurphey> http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:17:51] <Amanda19> or is it just a close family here?
[23:17:51] <rmurphey> please. read. that.
[23:18:08] <tw2113> i only recognize a few people, mostly from twitter
[23:18:51] <coldhead> you can't just start accusing IRC users of incest
[23:19:05] <Amanda19> then i think you should read this http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lets-be-Polite-P-K-Hallinan/dp/0824965620/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1329808722&sr=8-3
[23:19:24] <tw2113> heh, and i thought it got bad in #wordpress
[23:19:27] <Amanda19> rmurphey just ignore me, you dont have an answer
[23:19:46] <Amanda19> anybody else can help, ineed jquery expert
[23:20:11] <Amanda19> next time you come on marketing chat, i will post that link for you rmurphey
[23:20:16] <Amanda19> lets see how you will feel
[23:20:30] <coldhead> Amanda19: look up a book called "jQuery Fundamentals" and see who the main author is
[23:21:02] <rmurphey> coldhead: i bet that person doesn't know fuck-all about jquery
[23:21:06] <Amanda19> i dont get it, everybody asks questions here, only i am not allowed
[23:21:14] <coldhead> or manners
[23:21:15] <Amanda19> is it because i am a woman?
[23:21:20] <coldhead> you are allowed, Amanda19 !
[23:21:26] <coldhead> several of us are women
[23:21:33] <coldhead> you just have to ask better questions
[23:21:36] <coldhead> to get better answers
[23:21:42] <coldhead> it's going to be okay
[23:21:48] <Amanda19> so just if you dont want to help be quiet and dont post me links how to ask smart questions
[23:22:03] <rmurphey> i am trying to hlep you get answers
[23:22:04] <GoSox> Amanda19: are you attractive? if you post pics before asking your question, you'll get much more help
[23:22:14] * tw2113 facepalms in the corner
[23:22:20] <rmurphey> you are frustrated that you are not getting answers
[23:22:47] <coldhead> welcome back GoSox :)
[23:22:50] <palanivel> here i will write a demo code for highlighting the link bar when ever click the link but i dont know the jquery script       please help me.......http://jsfiddle.net/3WZnm
[23:22:55] <GoSox> of all the people to kick right now, you kicked me
[23:22:55] <Amanda19> gosox just shutup
[23:22:57] <rmurphey> and i am trying to offer you guidance on how to ask questions such that you will get answers
[23:22:58] <GoSox> thats dumb
[23:23:16] <palanivel> here i am write a demo code for highlighting the link bar when ever click the link but i dont know the jquery script please help me.......http://jsfiddle.net/3WZnm
[23:23:30] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: Please at least read through some of this book before continuing to ask questions: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[23:23:39] <Eviltwin> You've asked questions that are explained in great detail in the first few chapters
[23:23:56] <Eviltwin> The purpose of writing a book is so that you don't have to type it out to someone over and over and over again
[23:24:02] <coldhead> GoSox: sexism is just more offensive than ignorance somehow, but forgive me, i didn't meant to upset you
[23:24:06] <Eviltwin> You type it one and type it well
[23:24:10] <Eviltwin> And then you don't have to type it again
[23:24:17] <Eviltwin> People just need to read it
[23:24:33] <rmurphey> and then when you're done typing you make it free instead of charging money so that anyone who wants to can read it
[23:24:33] <Amanda19> ok let me type it again
[23:24:34] <Eviltwin> We have to pick and choose what we spend our time on here
[23:24:49] <GoSox> what should i be using to check and uncheck checkboxes? .prop( ), .attr( ) or something else?
[23:24:51] <Eviltwin> Mostly because none of us are getting paid for it
[23:25:10] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Either the element's .checked, the .prop("checked") or you can use .is(":checked")
[23:25:11] * tw2113 bookmarks that jqfundamentals.com site
[23:25:25] <Eviltwin> .attr refers to what's actually in the HTML (effectively)
[23:25:31] <Eviltwin> Attributes vs. properties
[23:25:36] <Amanda19> 1)))    the popup script on my site is scrolling up with the page, it has the css position fixed element, but still it scrolls up, http://www.numerologija.org
[23:25:46] <GoSox> should I be using .prop( ) to disable input's too?
[23:26:33] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: No, it has position: absolute
[23:26:40] <Amanda19> 2)))  I have added the code here  http://www.numerologija.org/popup.js  in the last few lines, to show up elements in webform, like email and name field, but it does not work in IE still
[23:26:45] <Eviltwin> GoSox: I don't remember with that one actually but I think it's still prop
[23:26:59] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: Do you use Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools?
[23:27:07] <tw2113> to be fair, it's easier to list what DOES work in IE, than to list what DOESN'T
[23:27:16] <elfrancesco_> hello
[23:27:22] <Amanda19> i use inspect elemt
[23:27:37] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: Then you should see that this actually has "position: absolute" in the style
[23:27:48] <elfrancesco_> I am gettint trouble with this piece of code : http://jsfiddle.net/S4EfJ/4/
[23:27:54] <Eviltwin> This guide explains how to thoroughly utilize all of the developer tools to help you solve your problems
[23:27:56] <Amanda19> and firebug sometimes, absolute is only for ie if I am not mistaken
[23:28:00] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ Amanda19
[23:28:00] <bot-t> Amanda19, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[23:28:39] <Eviltwin> You're probably frustrated because we're not helping you solve you're problem
[23:28:52] <Eviltwin> But that's because we're frustrated that you don't seem to be doing anything to try to solve your problem on your own
[23:29:07] <Eviltwin> Just keep asking for steps from us and then not doing them if they like too much work for you
[23:29:45] <Eviltwin> Like 34 of your popup.js sets the position to be absolute
[23:30:09] <Eviltwin> It's crap like that that makes us think we've read your code better than you have
[23:30:11] <ngharo> elfrancesco_: you're missing a closing parenth
[23:30:24] <Eviltwin> Which is really not how it's supposed to work
[23:30:39] <Amanda19> the problem is that the position fixed is overlapped with absolute in element.style  { }
[23:30:40] <GoSox> Eviltwin: can i talk to your good twin?
[23:31:13] <Amanda19> i set it up to be fixed in #popupContact  but it is overlapped by default element.style
[23:31:16] <Eviltwin> Amanda19: I just told you EXACTLY where you set the position from fixed to absolute
[23:31:29] <Eviltwin> If you're not going to listen, then we're really going to just ignore you
[23:31:41] <Eviltwin> GoSox: He's not really jQuery-fluent
[23:31:54] <tw2113> Eviltwin is his name Bob?
[23:32:01] <Eviltwin> No but good guess
[23:32:03] <GoSox> of course. a good twin would have avoided javascript all together *DOH*
[23:32:04] <Eviltwin> A lot of people are named Bob
[23:32:16] <Eviltwin> I gotta go
[23:32:19] * tw2113 knows an EvilBob on IRC
[23:32:19] <Eviltwin> Best of luck to you all
[23:32:20] <elfrancesco_> ngharo: in fact my pb is that i can't use the text() method ... i don't understand why in fact... for my parenthesis count i don't understand what you mean...
[23:32:32] <Eviltwin> Hope Amanda19 learns to debug while I'm gone
[23:32:34] <Amanda19> huh... i am looking at the css
[23:32:43] <rmurphey> nite Eviltwin :)
[23:32:43] <tw2113> elfrancesco_ the very last } needs a )
[23:32:51] <ngharo> Amanda19: the .css() call in your popup.js will override any linked css styles
[23:32:58] <tw2113> the one that opens $(function()...
[23:33:45] <Amanda19> uh, i see it now, it is in popup.js
[23:33:55] <Amanda19> bugger
[23:34:02] <elfrancesco_> tw2113  and ngharo thanks i made the update but in fact my pb is about the text method not available
[23:34:15] <ngharo> elfrancesco_: take out the [0]
[23:34:25] <ngharo> that grabs the DOM element, which has no .text() method
[23:34:35] <ngharo> only jquery collections can use jquery methods
[23:35:08] <Amanda19> yeah it works
[23:35:38] <Amanda19> thank you eviltwin
[23:35:42] <Amanda19> now it works
[23:35:45] <elfrancesco_> ok ngharo thanks for the explaination. I should use .each() method to retrieve my elements or is there a way to select one specific element (for instance the second one) ?
[23:35:56] <GoSox> Eviltwin: now had you just told her that from the beginning . . . ;)
[23:36:07] <tw2113> rmurphey when are we getting a new yayquery? :D
[23:37:48] <Amanda19> anotehr thing i am seeing is that youtube video is ovelapping my popup form, i set the z-index to be 10, but that does not help
[23:38:29] <ngharo> ?g flash z-index @ Amanda19
[23:38:31] <bot-t> Amanda19, Z-Index in Flash - http://www.flashdesignerzone.com/tutorials/t1026.php
[23:39:25] <ngharo> elfrancesco_: so you want to grab the first LI of the second UL?
[23:40:44] <GoSox> does js have an operator the same as php's .=
[23:40:51] <ngharo> +=
[23:40:55] <GoSox> ah
[23:41:24] <airandfingers> what pitfalls should i watch out for if i'm trying to mimic a form submission with a call to $.post()?
[23:41:25] <chjj> GoSox: + is to add and concatenate in js
[23:42:20] <elfrancesco_> ngharo: for the first i would use :first but for others i might use somthing like 3nth in fact i am searching on jQuery doc now i think i will find it this way thanks for your help
[23:42:59] <ngharo> elfrancesco_: yep, there are all sorts of ways to traverse the DOM.  good luck :)
[23:43:17] <elfrancesco_> thank you again
[23:47:40] <Amanda19> bot-t thanks
[23:50:31] <Amanda19> another thing is that in ie, the form fields name and email inputs are blank, the text - placeholders are missing, i added some code here, but it does not help http://www.numerologija.org/popup.js
[23:54:02] <ngharo> all your runtime code should go in document ready, see ?ready
[23:54:02] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:57:01] <K3|Chris> doesn't work reliably for me for some reason
[23:57:08] <K3|Chris> can execute a while before or after it seems
[23:57:41] <ngharo> eh?
[23:58:04] <K3|Chris> nvm
