[00:09:25] <linkaixi> hello
[00:10:16] <linkaixi> James Morriston ,are you here?
[00:10:30] <linkaixi> ping
[00:10:52] <linkaixi> Any one chat with me?
[00:13:43] <muhoo> nice, it's done.
[00:27:09] <tck> i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up
[00:30:09] <redfox75> has someone never used flexigrid?
[00:38:09] <kollapse> redfox75: I prefer DataTables
[00:38:16] <kollapse> http://datatables.net/
[00:42:54] <raver> on this page i have a slider in the header featuring featured articles.. the slide is on click, how can i make it move automatically after say 2-3 seconds? http://asteponline.org/2011/
[00:47:00] <tck> i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up
[00:48:40] <redfox75> kollaspe: ok datatable, but this can refresh data via ajax on click in a button for eg=
[00:48:42] <redfox75> ?
[00:53:52] <kollapse> redfox75: Check it out - http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/ajax.html
[00:55:13] <redfox75> kollaspe: i'll try
[00:55:16] <redfox75> thanx
[00:56:34] <kollapse> redfox75: Also, you have the fnDraw() function which redraws it. Using that in combination with Ajax will update the view.
[00:58:17] <Logitec> Hello guys, I have a slight issue here; I want to replace a div's INNERHTML to contain a message and then do a redirect to the login page.
[00:58:49] <Logitec> The problem at the moment is that the redirect function (with a 3 second sleep) is executed before the page is displayed, so the message is never displayed
[00:59:20] <Logitec> Does anybody know how to resolve this issue?
[00:59:31] <beasty_> morning
[00:59:39] <beasty_> is it possible to sort a object ?
[00:59:50] <kollapse> Logitec: Do you call the function once the document loads ?
[01:00:31] <Logitec> I tried with document.onload and document.ready, both have the same problem
[01:00:55] <Logitec> Are there any other event handlers like this?
[01:01:00] <jayflux> how is google's doodle made?
[01:01:19] <kollapse> Logitec: Pastebin the code ?
[01:01:25] <beasty_> byte per byte
[01:03:40] <shesek> Logitec, sounds odd; $(function(){    $('#msg').text(...); setTimeout(function(){ document.location=...; }, 3000);    }); should do the trick
[01:04:00] <Logitec> kollapse: http://jsfiddle.net/ZT559/
[01:04:07] <shesek> even without doing that on an event, the delay alone should be enough so you'll at least see the message
[01:04:33] <Logitec> setTimeout... that could be useful, I'm using a custom sleep method at the moment
[01:05:06] <kollapse> o.O "while (new Date().getTime() < start + delay);" -> That is awful.
[01:05:09] <kollapse> Use setTimeout
[01:05:25] <shesek> Logitec, oh man... the horror
[01:05:29] <shesek> that is more than awful
[01:05:30] <Cork> Logitec: domready should be triggered before redirect happen
[01:05:42] <Cork> Logitec: unless your using http redirect
[01:05:50] <Cork> (instead of meta redirect)
[01:06:06] <Logitec> Cork: window.location
[01:06:11] <shesek> Logitec, do NOT, ever, use a sleep function like that
[01:06:12] <Logitec> I see guys, let me implement setTimeout
[01:06:36] <kollapse> Logitec: http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_timing1
[01:06:46] <Logitec> shesek: Thanks, noted
[01:06:49] <Cork> Logitec: the old sleep function you implemented will hang the page until the sleep ends...
[01:07:23] <Logitec> kollapse: Thank you
[01:07:51] <shesek> Logitec, that'll make the window completely stuck and unresponsive, or even the entire browser on some browsers
[01:08:03] <shesek> and will eat CPU like crazy
[01:08:09] <kollapse> IE is in for a treat.
[01:08:12] <kollapse> :)
[01:08:29] <Cork> and many modern browsers will kill your page
[01:08:49] <Cork> if the sleep is too long (say 15 sec)
[01:08:57] <shesek> yeah, Jimmy, he's dead! and stuff
[01:09:05] <Logitec> setTimeout worked perfectly fine
[01:09:11] <Logitec> Thanks a lot guys
[01:09:22] <kollapse> 15 seconds of getting a new Date every cycle... talk about efficiency.
[01:10:05] <beasty_> can i do this ? apList.sort(function(a,b) { return parseInt(a.q) - parseInt(b.q) });
[01:10:09] <beasty_> on a object ?
[01:10:48] <tck> i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up. any idea?
[01:15:25] <tck> i wanna use jquery. the content of a empty Container (div id= 'test') is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the content of the empty container should be filled. any idea?
[01:18:34] <Zackko> whats the best way to attach a plugin like $('someEl').contextmenu(); to all items now and in the future?
[01:18:52] <Zackko> is there a way to do that similar to how live monitors added elements?
[01:19:42] <xec> Zackko: not that i know of. maybe something like  http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/  can help
[01:20:46] <xec> assuming all "someEl" are added after ajax requests...
[01:30:34] <astronaute> hello all
[01:31:09] <pjeweb> About jQ mobile: How do I change the listview filter placeholder?
[01:31:41] <astronaute> can someone please help me with sortable tabs ? http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#sortable <- when I drag them around, they have a vertical offset
[01:32:01] <astronaute> How to remove the vertical offset please ?
[01:32:23] <astronaute> Maybe it is not possible ?
[01:34:18] <pjeweb> Sth. Like data-placeholder?
[01:36:22] <astronaute> I'm new to jquery and the first issue I have no one can solve :) I feel lucky !
[01:43:39] <negev> hi, im using ui/sortable to put drag sort into a table. i have one instance where it's working perfectly, but on another table using the exact same jquery code, it works but when i drag one of the rows up or down it doesn't move the row underneath out of the way.  can anyone point me in the right direction as to what might be causing this?  i suspect css classes because i can't see what else could be different..
[01:44:33] <tck_> negev: check the tablednd plugin
[01:48:42] <tck_> i wanna use jquery. the content of a empty Container (div id= 'test') is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the content of the empty container should be filled. any idea?
[01:49:36] <Anticom> tck_ ajax?
[01:50:59] <negev> tck_: i don't need another plugin, i want to know why this works in one instance and not another
[01:51:39] <tck_> anticom: yes
[01:52:07] <tck_> how should the script looks like?
[01:52:21] <tck_> have you maybe a good reference ?
[01:52:33] <Anticom> onclick event fireing ajax and replacing the return stuff
[01:53:08] <tck_> i need the code. i am a jquery noob
[01:53:30] <Anticom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ there are not just many examples on there but also a bunch of links with more detailed information
[01:55:32] <tck_> i cannot find there what i want...i guess im just to stupid
[01:58:37] <tck_> anticom: can you give ne a exact link for my Problem ?
[01:58:47] <Anticom> oh boy
[01:59:06] <raver> on this page i have a slider in the header featuring featured articles.. the slide is on click, how can i make it move automatically slide after say 2-3 seconds? http://asteponline.org/2011/
[01:59:19] <Anticom> tck_ use $('a').click(function() { CODE GOES HERE });
[01:59:32] <Anticom> and then do the ajax stuff as it is said in the docs
[02:00:10] <Anticom> next use $(this).html(ajaxResult); to replace the link
[02:00:16] <Anticom> done
[02:01:27] <Anticom> raver how about a non-jquery approach? http://javascript.about.com/library/blstvsi.htm
[02:01:29] <tck_> okay thx
[02:01:34] <Anticom> youre welcome
[02:02:59] <tck_> and how can i put the ID value to the dataphp without to reload the page ?
[02:03:53] <raver> so setInterval calling SlideVideo by going through an array with the ids?
[02:05:12] <tck_> remember : it is a (a href) link
[02:09:22] <tck_> anticom ?
[02:09:55] <Anticom> raver that's how i would do it probably
[02:10:08] <Anticom> tck_ didn't get your question
[02:10:43] <Anticom> you can access attributes of a DOM element using .attr(attribute-name) and set them using .attr(attribute-name, newValue)
[02:11:14] <Anticom> so to get the href attribute for instance you would use $(this).attr('href');
[02:12:24] <tck_> nice ok thx
[02:12:28] <tck_> again
[02:23:18] <tck_> anticom: is it possible to invent attributes ? as sample: <a href='value1' attribute2='value2'></a>
[02:23:47] <Anticom> basically it should be possible but makes no sense
[02:23:58] <Anticom> you can either use the "data" attribute
[02:23:59] <Anticom> OR
[02:24:08] <Anticom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[02:24:18] <raver> Anticom here is what i did: http://pastebin.com/VW6Jc3NV code seems to be ok, but no slide :(
[02:24:45] <raver> it's also up on the website
[02:27:05] <Anticom> you need to call the setInterval function only once and then inside the called function you need to either randomly select one or increase id by one untill id>count(id's) (then set it to 0)
[02:30:18] <raver> can you show me an example Anticom ? this is about the third or fourth time in my life that i've touched js :/
[02:30:35] <shesek> tck_, it is possible to "invent" attributes, and it'll most likely work - but it won't validate. The correct way to do that, in HTML5, is prefixing custom attributes with `data-`, e..g <span data-foo="bar">
[02:30:42] <Anticom> usually i don't because that's the only way guys learn how to code :D
[02:30:54] <Anticom> but after going for a cigarette i'll help you raver
[02:30:55] <Anticom> brb
[02:31:04] <raver> thanks :)
[02:31:11] <shesek> tck_, than you can use data() to access it, e.g., in the example above, $('span').data('foo') would return bar
[02:31:21] <Anticom> shesek but for good manner he should use the data method :P
[02:31:39] <Anticom> haha okay good to know we agree :D
[02:31:55] <shesek> Anticom, the data() method is a way to //read// that data, not an alternative for defining it
[02:32:25] <shesek> well, not an alternative for defining it from the markup at least, which is what he's after
[02:32:31] <raver> to be fair, i don't wanna learn js, but when the boss says fix this, it's also programming, what can i say :D
[02:33:33] <shesek> raver, to get a programmer that known JavaScript?
[02:33:45] <shesek> doesn't seem fair to throw bugs you shouldn't be fixing at you
[02:33:55] <raver> you'd think that makes sense instead of bugging the php guy :P
[02:34:51] <shesek> JavaScript is a really nice language tho, you should really learn it sometime, regardless if your dayjob
[02:35:15] <shesek> Its has some awful parts, but the good parts are //really// good IMHO
[02:35:29] <raver> i do have some experience with adding plugins out of the box and noob stuff like that
[02:35:29] <shesek> You can do stuff you can't do in most other languages
[02:36:22] <shesek> With CoffeeScript sugar on top, its really fun and productive working on it :-)
[02:36:49] * shesek is off to make some coffee
[02:37:07] <raver> hmm
[02:37:13] <raver> reading about coffeescript
[02:37:50] <raver> ha! love the elvis example
[02:38:39] <shesek> if you ever do get serious about javascript, I don't recommend getting started with CoffeeScript before knowing JavaScript and its quirks well enough first
[02:39:35] <raver> yeah... i can relate to that.. i had a friend try to learn a php framework without knowing just some basic php, lol
[02:51:05] <raver> Anticom you smoke way too much :)
[02:51:22] <Anticom> no i need to finish an important issue that just occured
[02:51:26] <Anticom> <-- @work
[02:51:28] <Anticom> ;)
[02:51:32] <Anticom> i'll help you in a sec
[02:51:44] <raver> oh - i was just looking for some quit smoking sites to share if you want, lol
[02:53:41] <guy> jquery doesn't have event "mousewheel" ?
[02:53:50] <SugaSlide> theres a plugin
[02:54:17] <SugaSlide> @ guy
[02:54:31] <guy> the question is why jQuery doesn't have native thing..
[02:54:45] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[02:54:47] <guy> anyway, will use the plugin
[02:54:55] <Double_Rainbow> what could generate a key like this: b6d5e3e1d97806ef6a40fd5d67a1d098
[02:54:59] <Double_Rainbow> is this md5?
[02:55:18] <guy> md5sum
[02:55:24] <shesek> Double_Rainbow, why's your nick so long? it moved my nick-message separator like 15 pixels
[02:55:32] <shesek> what's the length?
[02:55:48] <shesek> yeah, looks like md5
[02:55:52] <Double_Rainbow> shesek: you are probably still on Atari
[02:56:26] <shesek> 32 characters, 0-9 and a-f (hexdecimal)
[02:56:27] <shesek> XChat, actually
[02:56:30] <raver> Double_Rainbow it is... 32 chars is a trademark of md5 string
[02:56:37] <Anticom> okay
[02:56:53] <Double_Rainbow> cool
[02:56:54] <Double_Rainbow> thaks
[02:56:59] <guy> any idea what is this?
[02:56:59] <guy> oEvent		= $.event.fix(oEvent || window.event);
[02:57:04] <guy> event.fix
[02:57:08] <guy> more specifically
[03:02:24] <whoru> Please help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/FLgjZ/
[03:03:03] <Zackko> Ok, so im stuck in sort of the same issue as before. http://jsfiddle.net/hgrPd/1/
[03:03:13] <Zackko> when I call .contextmenu on the element, i try to assign the allowedChildren array to the "items" property, but as is with assigning things in a loop, it ends up being the same for each instance
[03:04:37] <whoru> http://jsfiddle.net/FLgjZ/1/
[03:05:10] <whoru> plz its very urgent..
[03:05:11] <alex88> hi guys, in this code http://pastebin.com/3EuXWCqn why does it prevent event also if that if goes into true? i've added breakpoint on preventDefault line and it's never fired
[03:05:34] <Anticom> lol... actually feeling quite dumb now
[03:05:42] <whoru> hey alex88
[03:05:46] <Anticom> raver it's got to be something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/24AU5/
[03:05:47] <raver> was an easy fix?
[03:05:56] <Anticom> but firebug is telling me, that slide() is not defined o.O
[03:05:56] <alex88> hi whoru!
[03:06:31] <raver> plugging it in :)
[03:06:32] <whoru> here is solution for you http://jsfiddle.net/QUhH9/
[03:07:20] <whoru> you missed event param in funtion()
[03:07:28] <whoru> function() -> function(event)
[03:07:48] <whoru> try using Firebug
[03:07:59] <whoru> and use console.log()
[03:08:22] <Zackko> :) anyone?
[03:08:24] <Anticom> whoru any idea why setInterval doesn't like slide() ?
[03:08:49] <alex88> whoru: pm?
[03:09:32] <alex88> whoru: oh wait, problem is, button is set to disabled before the end of the function
[03:09:42] <alex88> so i need to manually submit the form
[03:09:45] <Anticom> no idea Zackko
[03:09:54] <Anticom> sry
[03:10:13] <raver> Anticom still nothing http://asteponline.org/2011/ not even the alert... seems to be a syntax error, but it shows me everything on a single line argh
[03:10:37] <Anticom> syntax error
[03:10:37] <Anticom> [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten] }); var ids=new Array(); ids[]=491;... 0; } alert(ids[counter]);}
[03:10:39] <alex88> whoru: that worked! :D thanks!
[03:10:45] <whoru> :)
[03:11:06] <whoru> plz  help me with http://jsfiddle.net/FLgjZ/1/
[03:11:48] <whoru> problem in beforeunload
[03:11:50] <whoru> event
[03:12:02] <Anticom> raver http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Mastering_Javascript_Arrays
[03:12:06] <Anticom> :)
[03:12:14] <alex88> whoru: not fired?
[03:12:19] <Anticom> js != php
[03:12:37] <whoru> please read comment in code
[03:13:17] <alex88> whoru: like the "do you want to live" in freenode's webchat?
[03:13:21] <Anticom> don't get your issue
[03:13:28] <Anticom> is it just that it's not working in ff4+?
[03:13:56] <Anticom> i mean... how can a simple return not work :O
[03:14:15] <whoru> my question is
[03:14:32] <whoru> how would I check if user has clicked on Yes or No
[03:15:00] <whoru> if Yes so AJAX call
[03:15:11] <whoru> since I need to process some data
[03:15:32] <alex88> not sure it is possible, because in that case you could deny the page to close and it's not accepted by the browser
[03:15:59] <alex88> imagine if someone tries to close a page, you ask if he's sure, he click yes, and you do an infinite loop, the page won't close
[03:16:05] <whoru> I am okey with Async requests
[03:16:06] <alex88> not sure if any browser let you do that
[03:16:34] <whoru> Its same as GMail
[03:17:00] <whoru> in which while composing email if you move away from page
[03:17:03] <whoru> its asks
[03:17:44] <raver> Anticom fixed the array thing and the slide name not defined
[03:17:52] <Anticom> arghhh :S
[03:17:52] <whoru> do you really want to discard the message or save its data
[03:17:53] <raver> now it tells me counter is not defined??
[03:18:08] <alex88> it says that if you exit it won't save, else it will
[03:18:17] <Anticom> since you need it in a pretty much global scope you need to define the var counter outside any functions
[03:18:30] <alex88> so in case user remain on that page it will save, else it won't do anything
[03:18:35] <Anticom> like <script blabalbal> var counter = 0; [...]
[03:18:41] <alex88> whoru: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[03:18:50] <alex88> whoru: Note that in Firefox 4 and later the returned string is not displayed to the user. See Bug 588292.
[03:18:58] <whoru> yes
[03:19:00] <whoru> I know
[03:19:09] <whoru> thats not a prob
[03:19:19] <raver> got it.. how f*ckn ids is not defined
[03:19:26] <raver> now* not how
[03:19:30] <whoru> I just want to check if user clicks yes send AJAX request
[03:19:43] <Anticom> same for them ;)
[03:20:01] <whoru> which is asynchronous so if at all user closed the browser request is already sent
[03:20:08] <Anticom> raver http://www.mredkj.com/tutorials/reference_js_intro_ex.html
[03:20:10] <whoru> so data will be processed anyway
[03:20:23] <Alex82> How can I reassign all index keys starting from 0 to 9 to LocalStorage existing keys ?
[03:20:24] <Anticom> i'm out for lunch
[03:20:55] <raver> cheers Anticom and thanks for all the help :)
[03:21:05] <Anticom> you're welcome (:
[03:21:07] <whoru> I just want to check something similar to confirm prompt where if(prompt("Yes or No")) { AJAX Call }
[03:21:32] <negev> hi, im using ui/sortable to put drag sort into a table. i have one instance where it's working perfectly, but on another table using the exact same jquery code, it works but when i drag one of the rows up or down it doesn't move the row underneath out of the way.  can anyone point me in the right direction as to what might be causing this?  i suspect css classes because i can't see what else could be different..
[03:24:51] <raver> Anticom left already?
[03:25:03] <raver> no more errors, yey :D no slide though boo :(
[03:28:00] <Xotix> I have a simple form. Name. i cna easily make i ajax by adding a click event to the submit, so it doesnt reload and get the value with val() from the input and use ajax(). But, how can i get the file as a string? liek it get's passed to the server as a post var.
[03:30:14] <xec> what file?
[03:30:51] <whoru> alex88
[03:30:58] <whoru> plz reply
[03:31:56] <Xotix> xec doesn't matter. a file. e.g. img. If you have a normal file upload and you press submit, the file get's send as a string in a post variable to a server. si want that "generated" string but not the refresh.
[03:32:15] <alex88> whoru: sry was working... btw i don't think it's possible to do the ajax call if someone press yes to exit
[03:32:26] <whoru> :(
[03:32:46] <xec> Xotix: maybe http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ ?
[03:33:40] <Xotix> xec Data from file select elements is not serialized. :)
[03:35:43] <whoru> is any other alternative to do so?
[03:35:49] <whoru> using some modal or anything
[03:36:03] <whoru> otherwise I have to leave it on PHP
[03:36:56] <raver> Xotix the file is never sent as a string, and it's not available in POST
[03:37:37] <raver> you have the FILES array which contains the name of the file and other properties
[03:37:52] <Xotix> it's sent via post request.
[03:39:00] <Xotix> raver, anyway, how can i get that with jquery so i can use ajax()?
[03:40:46] <raver> i donno man, i suck at jquery
[03:40:47] <raver> :)
[03:41:44] <negev> ok i've made some progress, it seems that when i drag one of the rows, sortable adds a new 'helper' row into the table with absolute positioning which is supposed to show as a blank row underneath the row you're dragging. the problem is the absolute positioning, if i can remove that from the row that has class ui-sortable-helper i think it'll look right, is that possible?
[03:42:02] <alex88> whoru: i don't think any browser let you don't close the window, do the ajax call on the onunload event and then just ask
[03:43:52] <tom^85> hi all i have a question, how can i get value from <input value when on that field was executed ui autocomplete plugin
[03:43:53] <tom^85> ?
[03:44:02] <tom^85> $("#tag").val()
[03:44:10] <tom^85> return empty value
[03:44:14] <tom^85> its ver ystrange
[03:44:52] <tom^85> anyone can help ?
[03:45:17] <tom^85> ?
[03:45:33] <Rembane> What is #tag?
[03:45:39] <Rembane> What kind of element?
[03:45:42] <tom^85> ints input field
[03:45:50] <tom^85> <input type="text"
[03:46:04] <tom^85> on this field wa run ui autocomplete
[03:46:11] <Rembane> Have the autocomplete function actually run when you try to get the value from #tag?
[03:46:19] <tom^85> and then i want to get that value
[03:46:31] <tom^85> no its  finished
[03:46:51] <tom^85> i mean value its actualy in the input field
[03:47:01] <tom^85> and now the point is to get tah value
[03:47:13] <tom^85> from outer action
[03:47:19] <tom^85> for example button click
[03:47:44] <Treborbob> so long as your code to get the value runs after the input is populated with something, I don't see why it wouldn't work
[03:48:01] <tom^85> exactly
[03:48:06] <tom^85> i dont know
[03:48:08] <tom^85> to
[03:48:42] <Treborbob> have you looked at $('#tag').length; to check it's actually finding an element?
[03:48:51] <tom^85> yeap its returned 1
[03:50:08] <xec> ?demo @ tom^85
[03:50:08] <bot-t> tom^85, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:54:34] <tom^85> but is it possible that can be any collision
[03:54:42] <tom^85> with autocomplete
[03:54:43] <tom^85> ?
[03:55:34] <guy> $('.foo', root)
[03:55:38] <guy> what's the root var for?
[03:55:55] <tom^85> its a contekstual selector
[03:55:58] <tom^85> its mean
[03:55:59] <guy> does this basically mean $('#what-ever-root-is .foo')?
[03:56:05] <tom^85> root > .fott
[03:56:07] <tom^85> foo
[03:56:12] <tom^85> yeap
[03:56:18] <guy> with > or just child of root?
[03:56:36] <tom^85> hm
[03:56:41] <tom^85> without >
[03:56:46] <tom^85> i think
[03:56:49] <xec> yes
[03:56:53] <xec> any descendant
[03:57:09] <xec> did you manage to make that demo, tom?
[03:57:31] <xec> very hard to debug without seeing the issue
[03:57:47] <tom^85> i know

[04:01:33] <tom^85> maybe it may help
[04:02:02] <tom^85> there is a code from autocomplete and input filed
[04:02:28] <tom^85> and when a field is populated with value returned from server,
[04:02:30] <xec> what is extractLast() ?
[04:02:48] <tom^85> oh sorr yi forgot
[04:03:13] <tom^85> its just ecplode(",") and then get pop()
[04:03:17] <tom^85> from array
[04:03:41] <xec> also, could you supply a sample of what the tag search request would return?
[04:04:18] <tom^85> its return a autosuggest list of tags
[04:05:25] <xec> my point is, try to make it a *working* demo, that demonstrates the issue - remember to check jQuery UI on the left as well
[04:05:43] <tom^85> ok

[05:10:58] <fgro> how can i select nested elements. example form#address input ... all input fields with the form with id="address"?
[05:11:38] <fgro> $("address") .. and then?
[05:11:49] <Cork> "#*
[05:11:50] <fgro> sorry $("#address")
[05:11:53] <Cork> :)
[05:12:19] <phrearch> hello
[05:12:26] <Cork> fgro: what you wrote should work just fine "#address input"
[05:12:28] <jomofcw> $('#address input')
[05:12:39] <phrearch> im trying to create a contextmenu plugin for fullcalendar, but somehow this delegate wont fire on the table cell
[05:12:39] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/511860/
[05:12:45] <fgro> Cork: ok. just like in css. cheears
[05:12:48] <fgro> ;-)
[05:12:52] <Cork> exactly
[05:12:59] <phrearch> any idea what the best way is to attach contextmenu events to not-yet-in-dom elements?
[05:13:05] <Cork> fgro: thats what it mimics
[05:13:06] <jomofcw> fgro you're right : just like in CSS ;) that's how jQuery works :).
[05:13:17] <jomofcw> +1 Cork
[05:13:45] <Cork> phrearch: as long as you have it wrapped in a jquery object you can attach it jus fine
[05:13:49] <helllen> helllo
[05:14:07] <Cork> phrearch: is the element you have in html or parsed dom?
[05:14:33] <phrearch> Cork: its in parsed dom
[05:14:43] <Cork> just attach it then
[05:14:52] <Cork> attach it before you append it to the dom
[05:14:56] <helllen> I have an accordion running and it works ok. I am having a problem when I load the content from ajax. How could I expand the resize the content to adjust to the new content?
[05:14:57] <phrearch> fullcalendar renders the html. im trying to attach it to
[05:15:02] <Wiz_KeeD> hello fellow jquerian
[05:15:03] <Wiz_KeeD> s
[05:15:07] <phrearch> aha
[05:15:32] <Wiz_KeeD> Can anyone tell me what could be the cause of the output inserted by tinymce to add extra "" ?
[05:15:57] <Wiz_KeeD> i place a link <a href="www.link.com">aa</a> in tinymce, and it comes out <a href=""www.ink.com"">aa</a>
[05:15:59] <Wiz_KeeD> on the other side
[05:16:29] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: i remember it was a pref that caused that
[05:16:43] <Cork> was a bit too long since i fiddled with it to remember its name though
[05:17:57] <aaronmcadam> or just ckeditor :)
[05:18:06] <aaronmcadam> i know, not helpful #justsayin
[05:18:31] <Cork> fckeditor had its purks too
[05:18:38] <Cork> ckeditor is a bit nicer though
[05:18:42] <aaronmcadam> still a lot better
[05:18:53] <aaronmcadam> the output is muuuch better
[05:18:57] <Cork> ya
[05:19:09] <Cork> but fckeditor wasn't that much better
[05:19:28] <aaronmcadam> he rewrote the whole thing
[05:19:32] <Wiz_KeeD> a pref Cork ?
[05:19:34] <Cork> exactly
[05:19:39] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone know a way around that?
[05:19:51] <Cork> changeing the pref?
[05:19:53] <Cork> :D
[05:20:04] <Wiz_KeeD> how?
[05:20:08] <Wiz_KeeD> to what?
[05:20:09] <Cork> uhh...
[05:20:11] <Cork> the config file?
[05:20:19] <Wiz_KeeD> config file of tinymce?
[05:20:23] <Cork> google the effect thats how i found it
[05:20:25] <Cork> ya
[05:21:18] <Wiz_KeeD> i googled it too
[05:21:21] <Wiz_KeeD> couldn't find anything
[05:22:50] <Cork> Wiz_KeeD: btw your getting the quote problem client or server side?
[05:23:05] <Cork> that is are you checking the string in js or ex. php?
[05:23:14] <Wiz_KeeD> client
[05:23:17] <Wiz_KeeD> wait no
[05:23:18] <Wiz_KeeD> server side
[05:23:23] <Wiz_KeeD> i mean i place a link in tinymce
[05:23:27] <Wiz_KeeD> i save the text
[05:23:31] <Cork> check what data the client sends
[05:23:33] <Wiz_KeeD> go in the front-end, check the text outputed
[05:23:40] <Cork> so it really is from it
[05:23:42] <Wiz_KeeD> has that extra crap
[05:23:57] <Cork> and not added by the server
[05:24:39] <jubby> Anyone in here using the roundabout plugin? http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout Need to figure out how to get a callback out of it.
[05:24:53] <Alex82> building an app with HTML5 + Jquery - I got a bug in my code. Basically I would need to reassign all the keys and values with index from 0 to the last element present in the localStorage. How can I do that? http://jsfiddle.net/Jb9QD/1/
[05:25:52] <Alex82> cause when i delete multiple values then after few deletion and adding new tasks it won t print the tasks cause its index has gone over the loop
[05:26:16] <Alex82> could anyone give me a hand?

[05:31:53] <kez> hi
[05:32:16] <xec> Alex82: that's a lot of code for a demo. maybe explain steps taken needed to reproduce issue?
[05:32:49] <kez> a bit silly , but how can I check if the value of an input has changed ?
[05:32:53] <kez> like when I'm tyiping
[05:33:10] <kez> have tryed change() to the input , but that works like an onblur more really
[05:33:12] <xec> ?keyup @ kez
[05:33:12] <bot-t> kez, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[05:33:20] <kez> keyup , yes
[05:33:38] <kez> the problem is after I finish my string , and move to another input , it fires the event one more..
[05:33:43] <Cork> no better with ?.keypress
[05:34:02] <Cork> keyup will miss repeting characters
[05:34:34] <Cork> kez: you need to filter it on valid characters
[05:34:36] <xec> Cork: are you sure?
[05:34:39] <Cork> yex
[05:34:44] <Lichurec> Hey
[05:34:47] <Cork> hold down a key and nothing happens in keyup
[05:34:51] <Cork> but it happens in keypress
[05:35:06] <Cork> yex==yes
[05:35:20] <Lichurec> does anyone got any idea on why IE does NOT get a proper scope in this: http://jsfiddle.net/lichurec/C2CCt/
[05:35:23] <Cork> thats the difference
[05:35:49] <xec> Cork: works in firefox http://jsfiddle.net/XLsdr/
[05:35:51] <kez> yep , keypress is better
[05:36:17] <kez> thanks
[05:36:28] <xec> keypress triggers on every character
[05:36:36] <xec> seems like overkill
[05:37:07] <Cork> xec: then you can just as well check change
[05:37:23] <Cork> if you want to check ex. number of characters (a max)
[05:37:29] <Cork> then keyup will fail badly
[05:38:06] <xec> yeah i guess it depends on what you're checking really, but change won't trigger till you leave the field iirc
[05:38:16] <Cork> Lichurec: i have a vage memory that settimeout gets its own scope in ie
[05:38:37] <Cork> Lichurec: don't really remember the details though, but it should be safe in farly new ones
[05:38:45] <Lichurec> well
[05:39:20] <Lichurec> I pass proper scope to the timeout, as a custom parameter, then .call() the initial function
[05:39:25] <Lichurec> works everywhere apart from IE
[05:39:30] <Lichurec> any version of IE
[05:39:35] <Cork> xec: keyup is rarly what your looking for if you want to check after each key hit
[05:39:41] <xec> Cork: also, keypress fires before the current keypress is done, i.e. value will be missing the last character
[05:40:12] <kez> wait guys , I'll debug
[05:40:14] <Lichurec> and I do need to delay a action on _init function of a UI Dialog; and really do not want to hand-modify the UI lib itself
[05:40:18] <Cork> Lichurec: i'm using very similar code except for the setTimeout and it works just fine
[05:41:02] <Cork> Lichurec: but why do you need to delay the init?
[05:41:06] <kez> yep
[05:41:14] <Lichurec> cos we resize page ondomready
[05:41:20] <kez> keypress fires before the value has changed
[05:41:23] <Cork> so?
[05:41:49] <Cork> Lichurec: just don't display the dialog until onready and it should be fine
[05:41:59] <Lichurec> and if the popout gets initialized on before domready - it gets unproper window sizing and gets positioned (in most situations) out of viewport
[05:42:45] <Alex82> xec: then another question, if i got some item alreaady inside localStorage with some keys and values. Ex. key -> index-0  value ->1  key -> index-1  value ->2   key -> index-2 value -> 1     And let's say i delete the one in the middle. How can I reassign the key index-2 to index-1 ??? Let's assume that there are several keys/values and i delete randomly some of those.
[05:43:05] <Alex82> So i mean with a for cycle
[05:43:22] <xec> kez, Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/XLsdr/1/
[05:43:42] <Lichurec> even if I initialize the Dialog ondomready (even after the resizing script) if it has a "autOpen" option - it still gets the "unresized" window size
[05:44:05] <Cork> Lichurec: wierd, doesn't happen here
[05:44:08] <Lichurec> and I am kindof tired of sniffing trough the UI lib  ;]
[05:44:16] <Cork> and i create the area i put it on dom ready
[05:44:41] <xec> Alex82: what?
[05:46:04] <Spadeski> how would I make the backgrround of a div transparent but not the element in front ?
[05:46:07] <Lichurec> Cork: it's not a code taht I wrote (I'd have done it in a completely different way), but: we have an app (a FB App, to be precise) that's loaded in iFrame; onDOMReady - the app's iFrame gets resized trough FB.ui API; if we trigger the Dialog directly  ondomready - it still gets the unresized window-size
[05:46:40] <Lichurec> probably because FB does not "resize" the iFrame itself immediately
[05:46:43] <Cork> xec: how i handle it from time to time: http://jsfiddle.net/XLsdr/2/
[05:46:58] <Cork> bah typo...
[05:47:06] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/XLsdr/3/
[05:48:36] <Lichurec> so I need a delay, 250ms 'round and the easiest way (and least aggressive) I could figure out is the one I mentioned; but that does not work (for whatever reason) in IE
[05:49:28] <Cork> Lichurec: the timer scope is the only thing i can think of
[05:51:10] <Lichurec> Cork:  I am aware of https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout#section_7 That's why I pass proper scope as a parameter
[05:52:36] <Lichurec> Ha!
[05:52:39] <Lichurec> "IE’s version of setTimeout doesn’t allow you to pass in extra argument."
[05:52:44] <Lichurec> Shitty software
[05:53:16] <Cork> Lichurec: thats what i meant
[05:53:22] <Cork> there is a workaround though
[05:53:30] <kez> how can I fadeIn/Out some markup created with after() ?
[05:53:30] <Cork> (thats what i was looking for)
[05:53:35] <Cork> http://alexle.net/archives/169
[05:53:42] <Cork> Lichurec: ^
[05:53:43] <Lichurec> Yeah, I just got on that
[05:53:56] <Lichurec> "Great minds think alike"
[05:54:11] <Cork> i knew about it from before
[05:54:18] <Lichurec> as I've mentioned - Shitty software
[05:54:24] <Cork> finding the workaround was another matter :)
[05:54:38] <Cork> Lichurec: ya the internet would be a better place if ie could just die
[05:55:04] <Lichurec> well
[05:55:20] <danzik17> Cork Lichurec : what are you trying to do?
[05:55:32] <Lichurec> it wouldn't if you look on the old times from the perspective of today
[05:55:46] <Cork> danzik17: its about scope leaks in ie
[05:55:49] <Lichurec> but as for now - well. I just wish they could timetravel
[05:56:08] <Cork> danzik17: http://alexle.net/archives/169
[05:56:14] <Lichurec> if we might have like "IE15" right NOW - everything would be just FINE
[05:56:32] <danzik17> Cork: i read it, and his solution doesn't seem that great ( really...eval? )
[05:56:42] <Cork> Lichurec: for a year until they dropped behind again :)
[05:56:45] <Lichurec> danzik17: Find a better one ;)
[05:56:47] <danzik17> so i was wondering what the actual issue was
[05:57:06] <Cork> danzik17: shity solutions, but when the browser doesn't support a better one...
[05:57:24] <danzik17> you're just trying to change the context of a given function?
[05:57:27] <Cork> danzik17: you lose the scope when you call setTimeout/setInterval
[05:57:27] <Lichurec> danzik17: in short: find a universal solution to delay "any function" execution, without loosing a propper scope
[05:57:49] <Cork> danzik17: and if you don't pass it along (and you can't do that in ie) it works in the global scop
[05:59:16] <danzik17> Cork: have to run to a meeting, but you can likely solve this with jQuery.proxy, Function.bind ( if your browser supports it ), Underscore's _bind, or by just managing scope with variables depending on how your code is structured
[06:00:05] <Cork> danzik17: no you can't proxy does the same thing as we do by hand
[06:00:16] <Cork> its not difference
[06:00:51] <Cork> not==no
[06:01:16] <danzik17> if you can make a jsfiddle showing what problem you're trying to solve, i'll look in a few minutes - heading to my meeting now.
[06:01:51] <Cork> danzik17: there is already one
[06:02:22] <Cork> Lichurec: though as far as i know it should be fixed in ie7 and thats my experience too
[06:06:12] <jubby> Hey All! Can anyone point me to a resource on how to write a callback into a plugin?
[06:07:17] <pachet> jubby: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2534436/jquery-plugin-adding-callback-functionality
[06:09:20] <Lichurec> Cork: nope; IE8 or IE9 still throws an error even on the sample mentioned above
[06:17:07] <kez> guys
[06:17:13] <kez> I have an input
[06:17:24] <kez> I double click on it and I get autosuggestions
[06:17:36] <kez> keyup , change wont trigger on this event
[06:17:48] <kez> what even should I use ?
[06:18:48] <Lichurec> Cork: this should fix the problem http://jsfiddle.net/lichurec/C2CCt/2/
[06:25:17] <FlashGordon> Hi, I would like to write a jQuery plugin but don't know how to modularize my code. With MooTools I would write multiple classes, each in its own file and use Packager to build one file for deployment. How is it done with jQuery?
[06:27:56] <rroelofs> FlashGordon:  Check out some of the jQuery plugins on GitHub and see how they are organized.
[06:28:29] <rroelofs> The ones I write are all small enough to sensibly keep in one file.
[06:30:47] <jubby> pachet: Thanks!
[07:08:12] <Sil4nc4> hi guys, a question, is there any reason why if you have multiple libraries, let say jquery.js, jquery-ui.min.js, jquery.tools.min.js etc that functions will fail because it searches the wrong library? Can this be avoided
[07:08:19] <Sil4nc4> PS: i need all those libraries
[07:08:56] <timing> the jquery-ui version should be compatible with jquery
[07:09:07] <Sil4nc4> if i change jquery.min.tools to jquery.tools.js it works find
[07:09:16] <timing> ?
[07:09:31] <timing> it can't find the file?
[07:09:36] <Sil4nc4> yes it can
[07:09:41] <Sil4nc4> works and loads both ok
[07:12:12] <Sil4nc4> but in the first case it will use jquery.tools.min.js because it seems to find the function it looks for
[07:13:21] <Sil4nc4> function(a,b)
[07:13:30] <Sil4nc4> in full version thats not there
[07:14:02] <Sil4nc4> it overlaps, i guess i cannot tell which library to use
[07:14:07] <timing> what is the name of that function? it's just the params being shortened becuase of minimization
[07:14:25] <JackBauer24> Hi! Simple question: I've got a following plugin code: http://pastebin.com/T9VLuRkT . How can I refer to the "#list" element inside of the "keyup" event? $(this) and "this" refers to the "settings.filterField" element
[07:16:35] <Sil4nc4> options.url = $.param.querystring(options.url, options.data);
[07:17:22] <Sil4nc4> @timing
[07:17:54] <Sil4nc4> $.param.querystring is not a function
[07:20:53] <Sil4nc4> its located in http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[07:31:13] <timing> Sil4nc4: the function is called $.param() not the querystring. at least in jquery
[07:31:25] <timing> you probably want to pass querystring to that function?
[07:35:57] <Gorkyman_> is there any good opensource js heatmap available? maybe jquery?
[07:36:04] <Sil4nc4> fixed it timing,
[07:36:08] <Sil4nc4> stripped it
[07:36:22] <Sil4nc4> thx for the time though :)
[07:37:20] <glauco29> hi
[07:37:28] <glauco29> I have to clones
[07:37:41] <glauco29> every one stored in a variable
[07:37:46] <glauco29> how can I concat it?
[07:38:15] <glauco29> var a = $('.selector').clone()
[07:38:15] <glauco29> var b = $('.selector2').clone()
[07:38:24] <glauco29> var c = a + b dont work
[07:41:01] <nail_> what would you expect it to do?
[07:42:11] <MariusKarthaus> Hi I'm using the widget factory to  create  jqeury widget. How do I call a function that is defined inside the widget from within the _init() function? The function is not on the same scope and is also not in this. I do not want to stick all the functionality in the _init function
[07:42:19] <glauco29> $('selector3').html(c);
[07:43:58] <nail_> glauco29: .clone() returns a jQuery object not a string
[07:44:34] <glauco29> I realize it
[07:44:58] <glauco29> How Can I output it as htm
[07:45:26] <juha_> $(".selector3").html(a.html()) ?
[07:46:56] <pachet> why not just $('selector').empty().append(a,b);
[07:47:53] <glauco29> thank u so much pachet
[07:55:28] <sadmicrowave> Hey all, I'm having problems with an animate function.  Animating +left works fine however when I want to animate -left the object moves to -left of the parent container rather than -left of the current position... any ideas how to fix this?
[07:57:39] <ablomen> sadmicrowave, get the element's starting position and animate relative to that, you can also use += and -= but i find it's better not to use that
[07:57:45] <ryanneufeld> -=
[07:58:06] <pachet> MariusKarthaus: where is the function defined exactly?
[07:58:51] <sadmicrowave> ablomen, so $this.animate({left: iMove+'px'}, 500); is left: += iMove+'px' ?
[07:58:58] <sadmicrowave> no way thats right ^
[07:59:19] <ryanneufeld> "-="+iMove+'px'
[07:59:22] <ryanneufeld> imove >0
[08:03:17] <sadmicrowave> excellent! thanks guys
[08:04:20] <MariusKarthaus> pachet: o never mind I was inside an each loop
[08:05:20] <pachet> sadmicrowave: you can omit the 'px'
[08:06:09] <sadmicrowave> :)
[08:07:20] <sadmicrowave> fyi, this is what I have now: $this.animate({left: "+=" + iMove}, 500);
[08:07:44] <pachet> $(this)
[08:08:50] <sadmicrowave> pachet, I use $(this) multiple times within this function so I created a variable
[08:09:23] <sadmicrowave> caching == faster
[08:12:20] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: += a negative number == -= number
[08:12:35] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: why not do it that way?
[08:13:13] <sadmicrowave> ryanneufeld, because a negative iMove will result in +=-iMove which is the same thing
[08:13:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, but it's less maintainable
[08:13:39] <sadmicrowave> how so?
[08:13:39] <ryanneufeld> -= in your code is clear as to what's happening
[08:14:15] <ryanneufeld> clarity > *
[08:16:03] <sadmicrowave> so your solution to 'maintainable' code is: iMove = ( iMove < 0 ? "-=" + Math.abs(iMove) : "+=" + iMove ); ?
[08:17:16] <ryanneufeld> not exactly :p
[08:17:18] <cactuss> hey i wanted to find all of the images that have a src that starts with http://foo. This is my attempt that doesnt work: $("img[src=\"http://foo*\"]")
[08:17:27] <b1lly> if i wanted to take a string "boom_bam_bang" and convert it to array but explode it by '_'         so that array[0] = boom, array[1] = bam, etc, is there a function
[08:17:44] <cactuss> "a_b_c".split("_")
[08:17:45] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: my point is if you can make iMove positive before using it .css
[08:18:07] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: like where ever your calculating iMove
[08:18:20] <sadmicrowave> cactuss, why use escapes instead of single quotes?
[08:18:30] <cactuss> does that make it work?
[08:18:34] <phlp> cactuss: $('img[src^="http://foo"]')
[08:18:41] <sadmicrowave> cactuss, lol thats not what I said.
[08:18:58] <cactuss> haha i guess i'm writing too many bash scripts lately :p
[08:19:06] <cactuss> thanks phlp !!
[08:20:01] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: I'm presuming of course that you're calculating the left position relative to the elements current position, in which case, switching your operands around could net you a positive number
[08:20:45] <sadmicrowave> ryanneufeld, ok I understand where your coming from now.
[08:21:08] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: yeah, wasn't trying to muscle in on your code or anything lol
[08:21:17] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:21:26] <_zoggy_> update topic. 1.7.1 is out
[08:21:38] <sadmicrowave> i know, I was just trying to wrap my head around your suggestion
[08:21:54] <cactuss> what if i wanted to pattern match.. so what if i'm looking for something that's like http://foo.com.*bar.* ? in $('img[src^="http://foo.com"]')
[08:22:04] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: k, tone is really hard to get sometimes in text
[08:22:16] <sadmicrowave> yea, you should try harder next time
[08:22:22] <sadmicrowave> :p

[08:25:17] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, thanks
[08:25:21] <cactuss> oh there's *= that might be what i want!
[08:25:21] <ryanneufeld> thanks ajpiano
[08:25:30] <glauco29> please, take a look: http://pastebin.com/DY7m15qy
[08:25:52] <astronaute> when dragging tabs around in http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#sortable there is a vertical offset, how to remove it please ?
[08:26:28] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: it's all CSS
[08:26:32] <glauco29> I store a copy of object in a variable, adter I try show it X times using a each, but I just get one time
[08:26:34] <Guest15771> Hello loves. If I set a variable like this: var thing = $("#thing"); can I call jquery functions directly on thing, or do I need to wrap it in a standard selector? I can obviously easily test this and I did and it seems to work, but I guess I'm wondering if I SHOULD...
[08:26:41] <sadmicrowave> loves?
[08:26:44] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: yes
[08:26:51] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: and yes you should
[08:26:56] <astronaute> ryanneufeld yes I guess, but I'm new to this, can you please help me achieve this if it is possible ?
[08:27:10] <Guest15771> ryanneufeld: <3 Thank you very much man!!
[08:27:21] <Guest15771> it looks much better, but I didn't know if there was any cost associated
[08:27:24] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: what you're doing is referred to as caching a selector
[08:27:38] <crab> on the contrary, there's a cost associated with wrapping it inside $()
[08:27:38] <ryanneufeld> and it's actually a recommended pattern/tecnique
[08:27:40] <sadmicrowave> caching == faster
[08:27:41] <Guest15771> right, so I don't keep having to look through the dom
[08:27:43] <astronaute> ryanneufeld I tried: #tabs .ui-sortable-helper top: 9px; but it only works first time, the vertical offset is back after it
[08:27:55] <sadmicrowave> Guest15771, correct
[08:28:00] <crab> $(obj) doesn't look through the dom, but still.
[08:28:00] <cactuss> cool i'm using $('img[src^="http://foo.com/"]').filter('img[src*="bar"]') and it's working for me!
[08:28:04] <Guest15771> but I wasn't sure about after "caching the selector" if I needed to or should wrap it in the $() (jQuery(), etc). But now I know I do!
[08:28:06] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: var thing = $("#thing"); thing.someJqueryMethod() is good
[08:28:11] <Guest15771> And that, sadmicrowave, is why I say loves!
[08:28:20] <Guest15771> ryanneufeld: wait, that's good?
[08:28:21] <sadmicrowave> Guest15771, wait, no you don't
[08:28:38] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: yes, you don't need to wrap thing agian
[08:28:42] <Guest15771> ok, great!
[08:28:50] <sadmicrowave> Guest15771, var $el = $('selector');...then reference it by using $el
[08:28:56] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: in fact, it's faster if you don't
[08:29:02] <Guest15771> $el? PHP?
[08:29:13] <ajpiano> ?$prefix
[08:29:14] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[08:29:16] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: in javascript the $ is just a character
[08:29:19] <sadmicrowave> Guest15771, no I just use $ signs when creating a dom cache
[08:29:30] <Guest15771> oh wow, that's awesome
[08:29:36] <pachet> *objects*
[08:29:40] <sadmicrowave> that way you know it is already wrapped
[08:29:43] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: it's common for people to do that, so they know it's a jquery collection
[08:29:46] <Guest15771> right. that makes 100% sense
[08:29:48] <ajpiano> i think it's clear from that which one of us got tired of typing that a long time ago
[08:29:49] <ryanneufeld> Guest15771: I do it that way too
[08:30:10] <sadmicrowave> Guest15771, I do it that way too
[08:30:11] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: not to me?
[08:30:14] <astronaute> ryanneufeld so is it possible to remove vertical offset ? it is maybe a bug ?
[08:30:14] <sadmicrowave> :p
[08:30:37] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: me
[08:30:41] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: I can tell you it's probably not a bug, and I'm not sure what you mean by vertical offset
[08:30:43] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: ag
[08:30:44] <ryanneufeld> *ah
[08:31:04] <ryanneufeld> ?g Hungarian Notation
[08:31:05] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Hungarian notation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation
[08:31:17] <astronaute> ryanneufeld try to drag tabs around and you'll see they have vertical offset: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#sortable
[08:31:42] <astronaute> ryanneufeld it must be a bug imho, as I cannot remove it :(
[08:32:09] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: that's not a bug
[08:32:12] <ajpiano> astronaute: get rid of the {axis: 'x' }
[08:32:29] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: .sortable({ axis: "x" });
[08:32:34] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's what's doing it
[08:32:46] <ajpiano> it does slightly jump to above where it was
[08:32:58] <astronaute> ryanseddon & ajpiano but I want to drag them on X axis
[08:33:27] <astronaute> ryanneufeld & ajpiano but without the vertical offset, i want them to stay at same vertical position
[08:34:16] <datlap> i have a table  broken down to many pages via pagination. the table is also displayed as a map via load(). now i use ajax to load the pages (via a func called ajax_get_update()) and load() doesnt get called anymore. how can i reload the map w/ the new page?
[08:34:19] <astronaute> ryanneufeld & ajpiano I tried : #tabs .ui-sortable-helper top: 9px; but it only works on first drag :( you still think it is not a bug ?
[08:34:19] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: you're gonna have to dive in to the CSS for it dude
[08:34:29] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: it's not a bug
[08:35:37] <astronaute> ryanneufeld & ajpiano can you at least tell me what to look for if it is not a bug, pretty please, i'm new to jQuery and first thing I want to do I am stuck
[08:37:58] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: reasonably speaking it shouldn't be miscalculating the offset there
[08:37:59] <sadmicrowave> what are the type of design graphic in the background of this image called? http://imgur.com/WFrEL
[08:38:17] <ajpiano> not sure why it is though
[08:38:35] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: oh, hmm, I just took a second look I see what you're saying
[08:38:40] <astronaute> ajpiano that's why I think it is a bug, because this does not work: #tabs .ui-sortable-helper top: 9px;
[08:39:07] <ajpiano> astronaute: that's because it puts an inline style on the element
[08:39:12] <ajpiano> with a "top" definition
[08:39:15] <ajpiano> so your style isn't hitting it
[08:39:38] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: probably not the place to ask that :P
[08:39:41] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: http://imgur.com/gallery/oReaT
[08:40:07] <astronaute> ajpiano I'm pretty sure it is hitting it as you can see on first "drag", but the style is reset after the first drag
[08:40:10] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: is it doing that in your own code? or just on the demo and it's freaking you out?
[08:40:32] <ajpiano> astronaute:what happens before the drag is kind of irrelevant, dontcha think?
[08:40:36] <astronaute> ryanneufeld in my own code same as on demo, the css is only working first time
[08:40:44] <ajpiano> obviously the style applied in a stylesheet works BEFORE an inline style is applied to the same element
[08:40:48] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: k, just making sure it's not the demo
[08:40:59] <Guest15771> well, just want to say thank you for the help guys, I really appreciate it! Now, I'm off and running (have a lot to do before noon today before thanksgiving break!)
[08:41:00] <Guest15771> <3
[08:41:16] <astronaute> ajpiano it works AFTER the first drag, but not after the second
[08:41:28] <mlechner> hi, how to select an all divs having class a AND class b <div class="a b">? $("div .a .b") doesn't seem to work.
[08:41:36] <astronaute> ajpiano it is somehow reset on drop it seems
[08:41:46] <ohcibi> when i do a console.dir(document.cookie); i see less cookies, than print_r($_COOKIE); prints. hows that? are there some cookies hidden to the js-engine?
[08:41:54] <astronaute> ajpiano try it you'll see it is funny
[08:42:07] <ajpiano> yeah man i'm literally laughing out loud
[08:42:34] <ajpiano> mlechner: $("div.a.b")
[08:42:39] <ajpiano> mlechner: space is a descendant selector
[08:44:03] <astronaute> ajpiano & ryanneufeld I'll fill a bug, as there is no way to remove it with CSS, thank you for trying to help me at least
[08:44:07] <ryanneufeld> ohcibi: some cookies are JS only, some are http only
[08:44:27] <ryanneufeld> ohcibi: also, are they all from the same domain?
[08:44:37] <ohcibi> ryanneufeld: yes
[08:45:03] <ajpiano> astronaute: yeah it's definitely something specifically to do with the axis option
[08:45:05] <andrew9183> how do i run a function only once using one() ?
[08:45:24] <ryanneufeld> astronaute: I apologize for dismissing you so quickly
[08:45:30] <ajpiano> because when you take off the axis, it doesn't jump on drag
[08:45:52] <mlechner> ajpiano: thnx
[08:45:53] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that's probably because a normal drag doesn't enforce one axis
[08:45:56] <ryanneufeld> ?
[08:46:06] <ajpiano> yeah, so it's mispositioning something somewhere
[08:46:07] <ajpiano> bummer
[08:46:25] <andrew9183> is once() deprecated ?
[08:46:37] <astronaute> ajpiano yes but I need the drag on X axis only (unfortunately) :)
[08:46:46] <ajpiano> astronaute: i'm working on a workaround for you
[08:46:59] <astronaute> ajpiano oh, then I wait !
[08:51:27] <diverdude> Is jquery a substitute for the less css framework?
[08:53:05] <scar3> if i have 5 textboxes in a row, how can i get jquery to count and tell me if 3 or more are blank? do i have to MANUALLY code each id, etc, or is there a way to do a loop of some sort?
[08:53:21] <andrew9183> you can use .each
[08:54:59] <shoelessone> var count = 0; $(".uniqueSelectorForEachBox").each(function(){ if($(this).html() == "")count++;});
[08:55:00] <shoelessone> or something
[08:55:06] <shoelessone> scar3: /\
[08:58:02] <pjeweb> About jq mobile: How do I change the listview filter placeholder?
[09:00:19] <glauco29> I have an object: var first = $('.multiple-services').first().clone();
[09:00:42] <glauco29> I insert it inside a div $('.multiple-services-wrapper').append(first.html());
[09:00:47] <glauco29> but it dont appear
[09:01:02] <ryanneufeld> $('.multiple-services-wrapper').append(first;
[09:01:06] <ryanneufeld> $('.multiple-services-wrapper').append(first);
[09:01:25] <glauco29> dont work
[09:01:52] <hdon_> hi all :) jquery ui question: if i .tabs() my <div><ul><li><a>tab0</a></li><li><a>tab1</a></li></ul><div/><div/></div> why are my unselected tabs also disabled?
[09:01:54] <glauco29> the append line is inside a loop ($.each)
[09:02:56] <glauco29> I spent time too much it
[09:03:12] <ajpiano> astronaute: http://jsbin.com/olijof
[09:03:20] <initself> jsfiddle is down?
[09:03:53] <ajpiano> initself: it seems to be really slow, whic i s why i just made a jsbin
[09:03:54] <ajpiano> :p
[09:04:01] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/5hANU/
[09:04:11] <initself> this code seems to work great in Firefox, not so much in IE.
[09:04:17] <initself> Any debugging tips?
[09:04:26] <astronaute> ajpiano thx im testing !
[09:04:32] <ajpiano> astronaute: you can see the code here http://jsbin.com/olijof/edit#javascript,html,live
[09:05:00] <tomh> hey is this channel also for qunit?
[09:05:08] <astronaute> ajpiano its almost okay, i think i can tweak from here thank you :)
[09:05:51] <ajpiano> ok good
[09:06:02] <ajpiano> tomh: ostensibly yes, don't know if you'll get good answers on it
[09:06:13] <ajpiano> initself: how is it not working in IE?
[09:06:20] <ajpiano> are you like, using the built in debugging tools from ie?
[09:06:26] <initself> i dont know how
[09:06:36] <initself> it looks like the json request is not being executed
[09:06:58] <ajpiano> debugging tips , debugging tips... wherefore art thou debugging tips

[09:07:00] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[09:07:01] * initself tries outputing error to screen.
[09:07:02] <Druid_> is there an jquery manager? mostly one doesn't need all features of jquery
[09:07:24] <ajpiano> Druid_: there is not
[09:07:56] <tomh> I'm using qunit and I sometimes get a 'complete' of my tests while the tests are still running
[09:08:04] <ajpiano> tomh: are they asnychronous tests?
[09:08:08] <tomh> yeah
[09:08:18] <ajpiano> are you using stop and start?
[09:08:21] <tomh> yeah
[09:08:36] * ajpiano runs out of useful advice
[09:08:38] <tomh> could it be some kind of load order?
[09:08:46] <tomh> Im using phantom.js to load them
[09:09:04] <ajpiano> Druid_: please read these two posts for our positions on this stuff lately http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/08/building-a-slimmer-jquery/ http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/22/call-for-jquery-1-8-ideas/
[09:09:21] <tomh> maybe when it parses qunit, it doesn't detect tests and sais complete, but after a while the tests are loaded too, so they start running
[09:09:36] <ajpiano> tomh: i really have no idea
[09:09:46] <ajpiano> sounds like an intricate situation and you might want to poke at the thing you just pointed out
[09:09:53] <ajpiano> if you're loading the tests themselves async
[09:10:45] <ajpiano> i'll brb in a bit gentlemen and gentleladies of #jquery, i hope all your endeavours result in success
[09:10:55] <initself> no!
[09:10:58] <initself> you're my only jope!
[09:11:40] <EdwardIII> hey
[09:11:51] <initself> HORSES
[09:12:22] <ajpiano> initself: the debugging tools are there, read my presentation , it talks about how to launch the debugger in IE, how to test if ajax requests are being fired, etc.
[09:12:31] <EdwardIII> i've picked up someone elses project here and their animation stuff is preventing form submissions: https://gist.github.com/1389245
[09:12:36] <initself> it looks like there's Firebug Lite for IE.....
[09:12:37] <EdwardIII> line #7 is responsibile
[09:12:42] <initself> not sure if it will help me
[09:12:55] <EdwardIII> well, i THINK #7 is responsible
[09:12:58] <initself> opt_out_flag: $(this).data('opt_out_flag'),
[09:12:59] <initself> that one?
[09:13:18] <initself> oh
[09:13:24] <EdwardIII> is there a more sane way of doing this so that things like submit buttons don't get thraped?
[09:13:24] <initself> you mean in YOUR code! hhehee
[09:16:18] <initself> firebug-lite.js failed
[09:16:53] <ajpiano> initself: when did i say anything about using fb lite
[09:16:58] <ajpiano> there are literally tools BUILT INTO IE
[09:17:04] * initself transitions to ajpiano's docs.
[09:17:11] <ajpiano> mazal tov
[09:17:56] <initself> ajpiano: are you playing Prince of Persia?
[09:18:26] <ajpiano> nope, i'm playing assassin's creed revelations and it takes place in constantinople
[09:18:27] <ajpiano> so like
[09:18:30] <ajpiano> almost the same thing right??
[09:18:34] <initself> totally
[09:18:43] <initself> but i'm talking about in 1984
[09:19:08] <ajpiano> no in 1984 i'm working for the ministry of love
[09:19:09] <ajpiano> duh
[09:19:15] <initself> i'm so slow
[09:19:32] <initself> so this F12 thing is gonna show me why my JSON request is bad?
[09:19:37] <ajpiano> nope
[09:19:39] <initself> fuck
[09:19:41] <initself> fsck
[09:19:42] <ajpiano> it will show you any other js errors
[09:20:00] <initself> i profile it?
[09:20:02] <ajpiano> later in the presentation i talk about how to use Charles to test if ajax requests are working properly in IE
[09:20:06] <initself> (should i keep reading....)
[09:20:17] <ajpiano> initself: did you used to be a doctor?
[09:20:24] <initself> Not yet.
[09:20:38] <ajpiano> ah, well that explains why you are yet to have enough patients
[09:20:39] <ajpiano> ;)
[09:20:44] <initself> hahahahahahahah
[09:20:51] <pachet> ;[
[09:21:20] <initself> this is a beautiful slideshow
[09:21:25] <initself> in and of itself
[09:22:04] <ajpiano> starting with that kid on the first page righte
[09:22:07] <ajpiano> anyway im out
[09:22:15] <ajpiano> short story for you is "Get Charles"
[09:22:41] <ryanneufeld> hahah ajpiano, patients lulz
[09:23:41] <glauco29> I have a json object
[09:24:11] <glauco29> Can I know the number of propertis?
[09:25:33] <Timcrack> hi. how can i define values from a <a href> link for ajax?
[09:25:47] <initself> FSHCK YOU OPENDNS YOU FARRT
[09:26:00] <initself> i can't use charlesproxy.com from my network
[09:26:01] <initself> IDITIOS
[09:30:03] <Timcrack> use someone the dialog function ?
[09:31:18] <Druid_> ajpiano thanks
[09:33:23] <andrew9183> hey ajpiano, in slide 57, the example is broke
[09:33:28] <andrew9183> it writes that foo is true ?
[09:33:30] <andrew9183> just wondering
[09:33:44] <Druid_> ajpiano, coming from mootools *cough* so just wanna give jq a shot on a new project
[09:35:55] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to add functions to the jquery object itself, similar to $.fn.foo ? how would i declare/define it?
[09:36:40] <tomasm-> do I just assign to $.foo ??
[09:37:13] <shesek> tomasm-, you would want to use $('foo').yourfunc(), or $.yourfunc() ?
[09:37:27] <tomasm-> the second... as its not related to a dom object
[09:37:59] <Timcrack> How can i use the content of another file when i sent a post via ajax?
[09:38:02] <Mkop> uh oh. just discovered that this page loads SLOWLY in IE7. takes like 15 seconds on a good machine
[09:38:27] <tomasm-> shesek, i would just declare $.myfunc = function(param1,param2) { ... }; , right?
[09:39:09] <shesek> tomasm-, yep
[09:39:32] <Mkop> andrew9183: it is browser-specific
[09:39:48] <andrew9183> ah
[09:39:57] <Mkop> ajpiano asked me fix his slides for him in payment for a favor he did me
[09:40:03] <Mkop> I'll do it one of these days... :-)
[09:40:09] <andrew9183> haha
[09:41:06] <andrew9183> i'm still a jquery noob.  i know i write bad code but i can't digest everything ive learned until i actually use it
[09:41:21] <Mkop> using it is the only way to learn
[09:43:55] <Timcrack> How can i use the content of another file when i sent a post via ajax?
[09:44:53] <Mkop> what do you mean?
[09:45:01] <ragas> can you recommend a good cross-browser testing site?
[09:46:40] <Timcrack> if i use ajax: the ajax command send values to the defined site and give back the result of the defined site..am i right?
[09:47:38] <Mkop> yes.....
[09:47:49] <Timcrack> how can i use this result?
[09:48:13] <Mkop> have you read the documentation at all?
[09:48:18] <Mkop> your question is very vague
[09:48:25] <Mkop> you use the success function
[09:48:48] <Timcrack> i have problems with english :/ i cant understand that documentation completely
[09:48:53] <Timcrack> i know...noob
[09:49:32] <Mkop> can you find documentation in your language? I can't explain everything over IRC
[09:49:37] <Mkop> tutorials and the like are much better
[09:49:42] <initself> when i run my .getJSON, it returns to the success function good stuff.
[09:49:46] <initself> however, no write happens!
[09:49:52] <initself> bad IE
[09:50:08] <Mkop> IE is indeed bad
[09:50:18] <Mkop> I just discovered that my form takes 15 seconds to render
[09:50:18] <cgiGeek> this channel is super interesting, but is getting addictive like facebook, have to log out to get some work done
[09:51:14] <datlap> my search result is served via ajax and my map is not reloaded w/ the new result. how do i load the map w/ the new result>
[09:51:31] <bakers> If I have an object foo, and a string bar how do I create an entry in the object for bar? I was trying foo.bar = '123'; but that puts 'bar' in the object
[09:52:59] <Mkop> bakers: huh? what do you mean by an entry in the object?
[09:53:40] <Mkop> datlap: I have no idea what you mean by map. a code example might help. use jsfiddle
[09:53:51] <bewl> does anyone know if a good slideshow (controlable) that will change out the 'background' of a div
[09:53:52] <bakers> Mkop: key/value pair
[09:54:07] <Mkop> bakers: foo.bar or foo['bar'] (equivalent syntaxes)
[09:54:53] <yonyon> when calling a function by using (this) i can't use any function of jquery
[09:55:02] <yonyon> any solution for this?
[09:56:23] <diverdude> can >>less CSS<< be used in combination with jquery and html5boilerplate?
[09:56:26] <ccohn> Do you mean $(this) or (this)
[09:57:00] <Mkop> diverdude: see no reason why not....
[09:57:16] <diverdude> Mkop: did you tryout the lessCSS?
[09:57:20] <Mkop> no comments about html5boilerplate (don't know what it is)
[09:57:27] <datlap> MKop: in my load(): i have var map = new GMap2... in my ajax_get_update() i have $.get(url, function(results){ $('#ajax_table_result').html(table);.... which updates the table fine. how do i update the map
[09:57:59] <Mkop> I've never used the version of lesscss that does client-side compilation
[09:58:24] <NickC_dev> Can anybody recommend a good OSX app to record the screen + webcam picture-in-picture style?
[09:59:16] <diverdude> Mkop: i see... That seems to be smarter...no need for a compile cycle then
[09:59:39] <diverdude> Mkop: wonder how it works out with jquery which i cannot live without basically
[09:59:39] <farhad2161> how can i hide all dives that their ids start with "test" for example "test1","test2" . $("#test*").hide() does not work
[10:00:10] <Mkop> someone once showed me something he built that autocompiled the css files whenever he edited the .lcss files
[10:00:29] <Mkop> farhad2161: read the documentation about the different selectors
[10:00:46] <Mkop> something like $("[id|=test")
[10:01:07] <Mkop> there's a "starts with" operator
[10:01:26] <diverdude> Mkop: well i think its fine if its just compiled at the client
[10:01:37] <ccohn> ^=
[10:02:02] <Mkop> but that introduces potential compatibility issues. if it works great, otherwise you'll have to do server-side
[10:02:09] <Mkop> let me know what you find
[10:02:45] <yonyon> farhad2161, $('[id^="test"]')
[10:03:23] <diverdude> Mkop: hmmm right
[10:03:32] <diverdude> Mkop: somebody must have tried that out before me
[10:03:51] <Mkop> yes, I'm sure. try googling
[10:04:19] <farhad2161> yonyon: It was great,thanks
[10:05:53] <initself> wtf
[10:05:58] <initself> why the hell does this work?
[10:05:59] <initself> http://www.factory-h.com/blog/?p=67
[10:06:05] <initself> $.getJSON( .somescript.php.+ .?. + Math.round(new Date().getTime()),
[10:06:17] <initself> appending a timestamp is a work around to IE caching?
[10:08:04] <initself> and here's why! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/264216/getjson-returning-cached-data-in-ie8
[10:08:31] <initself> can you add a nocache option to .getJSON or do you have to use .ajax?
[10:08:52] <Timcrack> I get the error: $jQuery is not defined; what do i wrong? Here the script: http://pastebin.com/DvLJxThn
[10:09:07] <ryanneufeld> ?getJSON @ initself
[10:09:08] <bot-t> initself, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:09:23] <diverdude> Mkop: maybe this is what the guy showed you: http://incident57.com/less/
[10:09:35] <initself> ryanneufeld: i don't see a nocache option there, or a place to put it
[10:10:07] <ryanneufeld> initself: yeah, use ajax
[10:10:16] <ryanneufeld> initself: getJSON is just a shortcut
[10:10:20] <initself> i guess i'm just gonna use the random function for now
[10:10:30] <ryanneufeld> initself: or, use getJSON
[10:10:37] <initself> (or maybe i should just rewrite using .ajax)
[10:10:50] <ryanneufeld> initself: yes, do that
[10:12:31] <Timcrack> I get the error: $jQuery is not defined; what do i wrong? Here the script: http://pastebin.com/DvLJxThn here the file wich is ajax linked to: http://pastebin.com/CVV8Fh6E
[10:13:15] <initself> ryanneufeld: that wasn't so hard
[10:13:18] <initself> ryanneufeld++
[10:13:35] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: cause $jQuery isn't defined
[10:13:40] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: use $ or jQuery
[10:13:44] <ryanneufeld> initself: nice
[10:13:44] <Timcrack> okay
[10:13:47] <Timcrack> thx
[10:14:07] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: also your php is grosee
[10:14:11] <ryanneufeld> gross
[10:14:39] <Timcrack> why? :(
[10:14:56] <silverwind> ryanneufeld, it implies that PHP can be "non-gross" :P
[10:15:00] <silverwind> Which is... false.
[10:15:08] <ryanneufeld> silverwind: quiet you
[10:15:12] <silverwind> :(
[10:16:07] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: http://pastebin.com/eQC7kAyp try that ;)
[10:16:46] <Timcrack> you just cut of the echo part right?
[10:16:50] <ryanneufeld> no
[10:17:01] <ryanneufeld> <?=$idrow->Titel?>
[10:17:13] <Timcrack> instead of echo :)
[10:17:14] <Timcrack> thx :)
[10:17:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:17:31] <ryanneufeld> so you break out of php, and then open it back up at the end of your while
[10:17:35] <ryanneufeld> a little easier to maintain
[10:17:40] <ryanneufeld> a lot actually
[10:18:53] <Timcrack> okay
[10:19:19] <Timcrack> you wrote <?=$idrow->Titel?> - why not <?php$idrow->Titel?> ? is there a difference?
[10:20:14] <dw> <?php long form was designed to avoid conflicts with xml preprocessing syntax
[10:20:27] <dw> if you're using php as a template language to generate xml you're already insane
[10:20:37] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: <?= $varName ?>  is the same as <?php echo $varName;?>
[10:20:40] <dw> leaving little good reason not to use the short form, except to be anal
[10:21:02] <Timcrack> okay thx
[10:21:15] <ryanneufeld> Timcrack: yes, there is a big difference, one echos (mine), yours does not :p
[10:21:31] <Timcrack> :d
[10:21:33] <ryanneufeld> <?= is a shortcut to <?php echo
[10:21:45] <farhad2161> how can i check a div with id="test" is exist,with jquery?
[10:22:03] <ryanneufeld> $('#test').length > 0
[10:22:25] <ryanneufeld> farhad2161: $('#test').length == 1 will be true if it's there
[10:22:38] * ryanneufeld Timcrack check this out http://ca3.php.net/echo
[10:29:35] <tomasm-> is there a way to get a synchronous json object from a function call without using callbacks? ie var data = $.getJSON("url", ...) ? or some other function
[10:31:36] <diverdude> would it be a good idea to use less.css and then
[10:31:36] <diverdude> 	    html5boilerplate to help ensure crossbrowser compatibility?
[10:36:15] <tomasm-> am I thinking incorrectly in trying to get a getJSON() call to return a value, rather than using a callback?
[10:41:08] <Timcrack> http://pastebin.com/T6kbwQrs - http://pastebin.com/T6kbwQrs i use that for a dialog. if i click now on a link -> no dialog pops up. if i define a empty div on the main page -> the dialog pops up but everytime i load the mainpage, a empty dialog will pop up
[10:41:29] <Timcrack> why?
[10:41:44] <sadmicrowave> hey guys, I'm looking for a better way to do the following (perhaps a way that doesn't consume so much processing capacity): http://jsfiddle.net/H4sjf/1/
[10:43:19] <iatkotep> Hey, to avoid FOUC, can I use jQuery to manipulate elements that are set to display:none, or do I have to use visibility: hidden?
[10:44:27] <sadmicrowave> iatkotep, jquery can't manip elements that are display none
[10:44:35] <Mkop> anyone have a recommendation of a jquery plugin to replace my current crappy menu? current one looks like http://imgur.com/ElZNo , I would want something that is along the same lines to reduce training friction
[10:45:00] <iatkotep> sadmicrowave - thank you.  that's what I thought.  I'll set them to visibility: hidden.
[10:45:27] <sadmicrowave> Mkop, are you looking for a similar dir tree view?
[10:46:16] <Mkop> sadmicrowave: preferably. dir tree isn't necessarily mandatory, but hierarchy definitely is
[10:46:32] <Mkop> the more similar it looks, the more easily I can convince my boss that the gain is more than the pain
[10:47:37] <sadmicrowave> Mkop, http://www.htmlab.gr/demos/jquery_folder_tree/# ?
[10:48:29] <Mkop> hmm, that might work
[10:49:07] <sadmicrowave> Mkop, alternatively, here are others that are posted on jquery's site http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/tree

[10:57:53] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/sDbjk/
[10:58:48] <Dave_Stein> emx: you can bind to sortstop and the ui object returned should have ui.helper

[10:59:33] <emx> Dave_Stein, the helper is still available in beforeStop. i need to do some quirksing to get what i want. but thanks.
[11:10:04] <hdon_> hi all :) non-jquery question: do any notable browsers not support contenteditable? i'm targeting firefox8, safari(version?), iphone, android, blackberry
[11:10:29] <hdon_> ah i found this http://caniuse.com/contenteditable
[11:10:32] <hdon_> lol caniuse.com
[11:10:36] <ccmonster> any idea?
[11:14:37] <ccmonster> what am i doing wrong with this $.grep ? http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/sDbjk/4/
[11:16:27] <ccmonster> it's a dead zone in here today

[11:26:26] <icedwater> I'm seeing an idiom var A=A||new function ... blah, does that assign function to A?
[11:27:19] <danzik17> icedwater: if 'A' is falsy, yes - otherwise, no
[11:27:38] <icedwater> But A hasn't been defined before, right?
[11:27:55] <icedwater> So it would definitely assign the function to A...
[11:28:06] <danzik17> dunno, a single line of code doesn't tell me anything
[11:28:49] <shoelessone> Anybody have a great solution for fadeing something out, changing the inner html of the faded element, then fading back in, WITHOUT the "jumpy" look?
[11:28:56] <shoelessone> I'll give an example
[11:29:32] <icedwater> danzik17: Ah, I was thinking it would be enough information.
[11:29:46] <icedwater> danzik17: Because the variable is defined in the same line... it can't have any value yet right?
[11:30:19] <danzik17> if that's the first time it's ever being declared, then yes, it's undefined

[11:31:44] <icedwater> Hmm, got to examine the scope then.
[11:32:01] <LessSeen> shoelessone: $('.element').fadeOut(100,function(){$(this).html(some_html).fadeIn(100);});   <-untested ._.
[11:34:22] <shoelessone> this is how i normally do it: http://jsfiddle.net/Ax5Kp/
[11:34:47] <shoelessone> but sometimes it's like the fade in will happen before the html is fully rendered, so it looks like everything is "jumping"
[11:36:42] <anrope> I'm trying to use a closure to pass an extra parameter to my callback of an $.ajax() JSONP call, as in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4201934/jquery-ajax-pass-additional-argument-to-success-callback . Unfortunately, the closure-wrapped callback never receives the 'data' parameter that should be passed to the callback. I'm guessing that this is because of the <script> tag nastiness involved in JSONP requests. Is there a way to pass an e
[11:36:42] <anrope> xtra parameter to the callback of an $.ajax() JSONP request?
[11:37:50] <ajpiano> anrope: you should do what the second answer tells you to do
[11:38:08] <ajpiano> you can't "pass parameters" to a function by 'executing the function when you need to reference it' which is what you're doing
[11:39:03] <anrope> ajpiano, the stackoverflow question isn't mine, I'm just using the first answer as a reference.
[11:40:11] <ajpiano> the first answer is not useful
[11:40:14] <ajpiano> the second one is
[11:42:14] <anrope> ajpiano, sorry, I linked the wrong stackoverflow post. This is hte post I meant to link. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6129145/pass-extra-parameter-to-jquery-getjson-success-callback-function
[11:42:27] <ajpiano> glurg
[11:42:29] <anrope> my code follows the pattern in the top answer in that post
[11:42:41] <anrope> yeah that was shitty, I'm sorry.
[11:42:45] <ajpiano> same diff
[11:42:59] <ajpiano> you cannot magically "pass a variable" to a function by defining it as an argument
[11:43:16] <ajpiano> it's a mistake that everyone makes early on in JS stuff
[11:43:37] <ajpiano> oh wait
[11:43:47] <ajpiano> yeah it's the same problem with iterator persistence
[11:43:55] <danzik17> ajpiano: it should work, except for the terrible use of the 'i' var there
[11:43:57] <ajpiano> see ?forloopscope
[11:43:57] <bot-t> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[11:44:45] <ajpiano> danzik17: i thought he was doing the thing from the first question still... var foo = "bar";  $.getJSON("x.php", function(data, bar) { })
[11:45:00] <danzik17> fair nuff.
[11:45:06] <ajpiano> anyhow
[11:45:17] <ajpiano> the problem is that in a for loop the iterator persists after the loop
[11:46:02] <anrope> let me post a gist
[11:46:13] <Mkop> ajpiano: on that first SO link, one of the answers is completely eroneous, right? I will comment to that effect
[11:46:57] <ajpiano> mkop not erroneous, just irrelevant to the question
[11:47:19] <Mkop> why is it not erroneous? won't it call success_cb immediately?
[11:47:25] <Mkop> unless success_cb returns a function
[11:47:45] <Mkop> oh no wait, I'm confused
[11:47:45] <ajpiano> that's not an answer, it's the question
[11:47:48] <ajpiano> lol
[11:48:21] <danzik17> the question IS the answer!  ( mind === blown)
[11:48:30] <Sil4nc4> in a cgridview, if you have a function you need to call that processes $data variable how do you do it?             'value' => 'CHtml::encode($data->username)' this works but this 'customFunction($data->username)' not.
[11:48:34] <buuu> can someone help me with a jquery ui question , im not sure if it is a bug but it looks so.
[11:48:51] <Mkop> no, I was looking at the answer. I was just misreading it
[11:49:08] <pachet> buuu: it's probably a css issue, that seems to be the theme of the day
[11:49:13] <pachet> if not, we can always blame ajpiano

[11:49:31] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: ya check out that blog post i wrote? just updated it
[11:49:41] <anrope> this pattern works fine for a regular json call
[11:49:47] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: yes i did
[11:49:50] <buuu> no its not a css problem :)
[11:49:52] <anrope> which is to say, I get an extra parameter
[11:50:08] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: options is actually updatable now and i took out the context since that can be done via $.proxy when calling
[11:50:13] <ajpiano> anrope: you have to actually post the gist

[11:50:44] <anrope> if you insist
[11:50:53] <buuu> When i use Jquery UI on a input field type="File" on submit the $_FILES[] array is plain empty. If i disable the effect . Everything works fine!
[11:51:24] <buuu> im using the toggle slide effect on a button
[11:51:42] <buuu> that shows/hides Browsefield ( input type= file)
[11:52:01] <danzik17> anrope: don't use jsonpCallback, use success
[11:52:38] <anrope> danzik17, I was under the impression that I need to use jsonpCallback because it's JSONP; JSON causes an CSRF issue.
[11:53:25] <buuu> anyone got some ideas? :/
[11:53:33] <buuu> i can share screen on skype
[11:53:36] <buuu> with the debugger
[11:53:58] <danzik17> anrope:  you need JSONP yes, but you're mistaken about what jsonpCallback does - see ?ajax
[11:53:58] <bot-t> anrope, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:54:13] <ajpiano> anrope: what danzik17 just said :p
[11:54:43] <ajpiano> buuu: using a slide effect on a form shouldn't affect the way a file input behaves
[11:54:57] <ajpiano> also, creating a live demo is considered preferable to screen sharing

[11:56:34] <thenior> hey everyone, quick question
[11:56:51] <buuu> well yes i know that
[11:57:08] <anrope> ajpiano, danzik17. ahhhhh that did it. that certainly makes a lot more sense, using success. Thanks for your help.
[11:57:16] <ajpiano> Timcrack: you can't have mulitple ids in the dom
[11:57:18] <ajpiano> duplicated
[11:57:27] <thenior> I'm trying to understand the syntax for using after() with load(). I'm wanting to .load() something after $(this) element
[11:57:32] <ajpiano> you have multiple bearbeiten_link id, and same for loeschen link
[11:57:39] <ajpiano> thenior: you don't
[11:58:15] <ajpiano> thenior: you would use var $el = $(this); $.get("foo.php", function(data) { $el.after(data);   }
[11:58:22] <ajpiano> or something along those lines
[11:58:40] <ajpiano> .load is for the very specific use case that you want to replace the entire content of an element with the data returned from the ajax
[11:58:42] <Mkop> anyone know stuff about jqwidgets? looks like quality stuff, they have more things than jquery-ui. I'm surprised I've never come acrosss them before
[11:58:56] <ajpiano> Mkop: i had the same reaction, i came across it the other day for the first time
[11:59:06] <thenior> ajpiano: I see, so get seems to have more functionality
[11:59:16] <Timcrack> ajpiano: how can i solve the problem?
[11:59:38] <Timcrack> ajpiano: should i make for every link an own ID and for every link another javascript?
[11:59:43] <ajpiano> no
[11:59:45] <ajpiano> you should use a class
[11:59:55] <Mkop> I was hoping for a list of 20 reasons why jquery-ui > jqwidgets. seems I won't be getting that from adam at least
[11:59:57] <Timcrack> ah okay
[12:00:00] <Timcrack> i try it
[12:00:24] <ajpiano> $(".bearbeiten_link").click(function() { /* use $(this) instead of querying the dom */    });
[12:01:32] <Mkop> seems they don't have a datatable widget. that would have been a killer feature, allowing me to ditch YUI entirely
[12:01:58] <Mkop> I can't wait for jquery-ui's datatable...
[12:02:09] <icedwater> danzik17: Thanks, I checked and A earlier was passed in as an argument, so it's not entirely senseless.
[12:03:40] <gho5t> I'm creating a tooltip widget. In my create method I create an element and add it to the dom. Is there a way to save a reference to this element so I can refer to it in my widget's methods? I'm trying ref = el.after('<div class="tooltip" />')
[12:04:20] <Timcrack> ajpiano: very nice! thx!
[12:04:49] <ajpiano> gho5t: var ref = $("<div class='tooltip'>").insertAfter( el );
[12:04:59] <gho5t> thanks
[12:07:44] <permyriad> how can I traverse an arbitrary json-derived object? I see there are tree traversal methods but those seem to be oriented towards walking the DOM
[12:08:49] <permyriad> like suppose I wanted to uppercase every string in a json response
[12:09:08] <permyriad> including deeply nested strigns
[12:09:16] <gho5t> permyriad: $.each
[12:09:42] <permyriad> gho5t: but that doesn't seem to recursive into nested structures
[12:11:16] <rroelofs> permyriad:  DOM traversal only works because all elements descend from the same base class.  For a js object you will have to detect variable type and recurse yourself.
[12:14:24] <permyriad> it doesn't have to handle an arbitrary js object, just one deserialized from json.  maybe there is a json-handling library that might have somethign for this?
[12:14:49] <silverwind> Super question of t3h month: What is a good and reliable file upload plugin?
[12:15:39] <gho5t> ajpiano: if I apply this tooltip to multiple elements on a page, ref seems to be equal to the last one that got applied
[12:16:50] <gho5t> so it doesn't seem to be reliable reference

[12:25:06] <buuu> no
[12:25:09] <buuu> there is no ajax

[12:26:27] <brainLess1> okay.. maybe i should watched the youtube video ^^
[12:26:39] <buuu> well its 1min 26 seconds i believe..
[12:26:48] <buuu> the first 10 seconds are mess you can skip them
[12:28:34] <brainLess1> k, im tethering right now and the connection is not the best... this should take a minute or two
[12:28:39] <TheCerbere> hii do u have the link of the youtube video?

[12:29:27] <TheCerbere> thx u :)
[12:35:36] <brainLess1> couldn see anything in a solution my connection allowed. Would you mind to give a link to the site ? It's easier to see the problem

[12:38:59] <brainLess1> Cause jquery returns the pixel value. Are relative values really neccessary? Or has the parent element a fixed size?
[12:42:34] <BlaDe^> brainLess1: yes
[12:42:40] <BlaDe^> brainLess1: it's a progress bar

[12:46:14] <feelfreetoQ> quick question
[12:47:38] <feelfreetoQ> trying to select <ul class="blah"> <li></li></ul> the li items in the ul and what is the syntax for selection?  $("ul.blah li") or $("ul.blah > li") or are both wrong?
[12:48:08] <gho5t> so jquery ui doesn't have a tooltip?
[12:49:16] <Chopps> gho5t check here http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/

[12:49:54] <buuu> more than 2hours already :/
[12:50:01] <feelfreetoQ> any help?
[12:50:16] <buuu> well i posted a youtube movie of the problem

[12:53:08] <nicksergeant> buuu: post on http://jsfiddle.net
[12:54:23] <buuu> uhm i cant actually because the page is generated by php and reads form sqlite database
[12:54:27] <buuu> from*
[12:54:28] <feelfreetoQ> ty nick, trying it now
[12:54:42] <buuu> what i can do is give you a link with it working
[12:54:55] <buuu> which means Jquery UI disabled
[12:55:01] <buuu> you can upload an image to me no problem
[12:55:22] <buuu> and you could moniutor using Firebug -> net tab the successful POST to me
[12:55:52] <buuu> then i will enable Jquery UI and suddenly you will POST again successfuly but the image part of you upload will be missing

[12:57:47] <Rembane> [^\d]
[12:57:48] <Norgus> so i want periods and not the 'point' between 2 numbers
[12:57:59] <Rembane> Oh
[12:58:25] <Rembane> [^\d\.]+
[12:58:27] <Rembane> Might work
[12:58:29] <Rembane> Hm...
[12:59:01] <Norgus> would the brackts and bar work somehow?
[12:59:59] <feelfreetoQ> ok, so i copied this tutorial word for word, http://buildinternet.com/2009/01/how-to-make-a-smooth-animated-menu-with-jquery/ and am trying to use the selector $('ul.blah li') and its not working.  everything looks right to me...am I doin somethin wrong?
[13:01:16] <Rembane> Norgus: Try it and see what happens, it might become weird. :D

[13:15:50] <Chopps> 1	\d\.	\.
[13:16:01] <Chopps> sorry, wrong window
[13:16:49] <Chopps> that regex will get \. from \d\.\d
[13:16:58] <Chopps> dammit
[13:19:58] <KodeKamel> Norgus:  no problem...  I can't write a regex without it. lol
[13:21:32] <datlap> a table can be sorted by $("table#ajax_table_result").tablesorter({ sortList: [[1,0]] }); . when user clicks on next, i load page 2,3 of the table using ajax. but the table sorter script is no longer called. what to do?
[13:24:22] <feelfreetoQ> @S|acker http://jsfiddle.net/RmTKU/1/ updated jsfiddle, the selection works there, but the subtext gets lost?  not sure what the fix is
[13:24:25] <Tonel> Can someone check what is wrong with the code please?
[13:24:26] <Tonel> http://jsfiddle.net/CwyHT/
[13:24:30] <Tonel> Would really appreciate it
[13:24:57] <buuu> at first glance double brackets
[13:25:19] <buuu>  $("#theLink")) = >  $("#theLink")
[13:25:47] <Tonel> Ah ups
[13:26:11] <Tonel> Still doesnt work
[13:27:39] <bbonora> Is it considered a bad practice to dynamically create an iframe?  The iframe will be pulling in content from YouTube.
[13:28:37] <dw> bbonora: no reason why not
[13:28:55] <dw> limit your use of iframes to only a few per page where possible, they demolish performance
[13:29:00] <bbonora> Cool! That's the way I'll do it
[13:29:08] <dw> also cross domain iframes swallow DOM mouse events at least on firefox
[13:29:35] <bbonora> dw: what do you mean swallow dom mouse events?
[13:29:52] <dw> try implementing drag'n'drop or drag to resize over an iframe with content in another domain :)
[13:30:10] <dw> mousemove events don't propagate while the mouse is over the frmae
[13:30:28] <buuu> anyone want to look at an odd problem
[13:30:48] <buuu> firebug required or POST/GET request monitor tool
[13:30:48] <bbonora> huh... You think I'm better off dynamically embedding a flash player?
[13:31:00] <TheoMurpse> How can I select the nth TD in a TR? I tried $('tr>td:eq(n)') but it's only selecting the nth from the first row. I want to build a selector that gives me nth of row 1, nth of row 2, ...
[13:31:09] <dw> bbonora: is this to embed a youtube vid?
[13:31:09] <buuu> i think embedding is better
[13:31:21] <nicksergeant> TheoMurpse: $('tr > td').eq(n)
[13:31:25] <TheoMurpse> I know I can $('tr').each(function(i,e){$(e).find('td:eq(n)');} but that's long
[13:31:26] <dw> the iframe embed is the better approach there
[13:31:34] <ajpiano> TheoMurpse: use the nth-child selector
[13:31:38] <nicksergeant> TheoMurpse: ah, nevermind
[13:31:44] <bbonora> dw: yup, basically I want to avoid having multiple instances of YouTube on each page
[13:31:45] <nicksergeant> TheoMurpse: read that wrong
[13:32:05] <TheoMurpse> ajpiano aren't I using that with :eq(n)?
[13:32:16] <ajpiano> $("tbody td:nth-child(3)")
[13:32:17] <ajpiano> nope
[13:32:27] <ajpiano> otherwise the docs for nth-child would say "does the same thing as eq"
[13:32:34] <ajpiano> but they don't say that at all
[13:32:52] <TheoMurpse> So does :eq(n) only select the nth element of the entire previous part of the selector? In other words, "tr td" gives me all TDs and then :eq(n) reduces it to the single nth element of "tr td"?
[13:32:59] <ajpiano> corret
[13:33:10] <TheoMurpse> ok thanks, this makes my code much nicer :)
[13:39:27] <Tonel> Can someone take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/CwyHT/3/
[13:39:33] <Tonel> couple of lines, but I'm stuck
[13:39:40] <Tonel> The First works, the Second doesn't
[13:39:53] <Tonel> ah nvm
[13:40:02] <Tonel> case sensitivity
[13:40:05] <buuu> yes
[13:41:53] <MisterSpeaker> I'm a bit confused by the $.ajax docs: Are the success/error/complete methods of $.ajax going to be deprecated (in favor of deferred) or does the deprecation only apply to the success/error/compete methods of the (jq)XHR objects returned as parameters to the ajax callbacks (for example, the callback function from $.get)? http://pastebin.com/wVDvfDFa
[13:43:13] <ajpiano> MisterSpeaker: the latter
[13:43:22] <ajpiano> only the aliases on the jqXHR will be deprecated
[13:44:03] <ajpiano> $.ajax({success: fn}) isn't going anywhere
[13:44:07] <Tonel> Hope Visual Studio 2012 will have better JScript support...
[13:44:12] <ajpiano> just $.ajax().success();
[13:44:22] <MisterSpeaker> Ah excellent! (I think thats good for newbies who might not grok deferred)
[13:44:55] <b0ot> How would I had add a roe to a table using jquery.
[13:45:01] <b0ot> Row
[13:47:19] <c_t_montgomery> $('<tr>CONTENT</tr>').appendTo('table')
[13:47:22] <buuu> where can i report a bug ?
[13:47:34] <c_t_montgomery> buuu: http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket?redirectedfrom=
[13:48:55] <Barryville1> jquery newb here, when you have .load('ajax/content.html');    what the format that the URL can be in? can it be www.google.com? or how does it work?
[13:49:11] <ajpiano> it has to be a url on your own domain
[13:49:41] <Barryville1> ajpiano: if I'm using jsfiddle to prototype, is there anyway to set something so the .load returns content?
[13:49:46] <ajpiano> yes
[13:50:09] <ajpiano> see section on the left for Testing Ajax Requests
[13:50:32] <ajpiano> basically you can post to /echo/html/ and send a data object {html: "<div>thehtmlyouwanttogetback</div>"}
[13:50:38] <ajpiano> and that's what you'll get
[13:50:59] <Barryville1> ajpiano: awesome thanks
[13:59:47] <winterpk> Hi everbody
[14:00:39] <ekkis> is there a way I can find out the location of a script included in a page within the script?
[14:01:00] <ajpiano> no
[14:01:36] <hightekvagabond> better question: why would you want to?
[14:01:43] <janthony> Has anyone been able to get the jquery cycle plugin to work in IE when the text is rotating on a transparent background?
[14:01:47] <winterpk> Does anyone know how I can stop a the resize event given a condition?  Here is my fiddle example http://jsfiddle.net/winterpk/K8L4c/358/.  I simply need to figure out how to stop the resize from happening.  Anyone have any ideas
[14:02:09] <ekkis> hightekvagabond: addressed to me?
[14:02:21] <hightekvagabond> ekkis: yes
[14:03:03] <ekkis> janthony: I used the cycle with some transparency stuff on IE but I don't know if it's quite your question.  check out: http://www.pamelaalexandre.com/
[14:03:42] <ajpiano> winterpk: i don't see where there's a resizable thing
[14:03:48] <janthony> Yeah, I'm using the clearType: false parameter with the plugin, but it still makes the text anti-alias on fade
[14:04:18] <winterpk> ajpiano: click on a cell
[14:04:21] <ekkis> hightekvagabond: I'm working on a jQuery plugin that picks up attributes from the tag that included the plugin but I'm having trouble determining which tag was used because I cannot rely on selecting the last one in the array due to dynamic loading
[14:05:02] <ajpiano> winterpk: why are you not using the maxHeight option of the resizable
[14:05:43] <ekkis> winterpk: .stopPropagation() ?
[14:06:02] <winterpk> ekkis: i'll give it a try;
[14:06:28] <ekkis> winterpk: look it up - I think it'll do what you want
[14:06:40] <hightekvagabond> ekkis… ok, that makes sense…. I've wished a couple times for a $(document).ready_last() method a few times that would move my thing to happen after all the other readys…. but never wanted it bad enough to really dig in and make it… something like that would be nice in such a case
[14:06:55] <winterpk> so would I do that on the event?  like event.stopPropagation();
[14:07:01] <ajpiano> stopPropagation has nothing to do with what he wants, ekkis, winterpk
[14:07:09] <ajpiano> winterpk: answer the question i asked oyu
[14:07:14] <Godfather_> hi
[14:07:22] <ekkis> hightekvagabond: ah yes, I've had issues with that too... a .ready_last() would be cool
[14:07:26] <botfather> ;]
[14:07:35] <ekkis> ajpiano: oh, ok
[14:08:19] <Godfather_> can anyone recommend a first book of jquery ? i have read good reviews on "JQuery in action"
[14:08:25] <hightekvagabond> of course a .ready_last would still be built as a queue and someone else could ready_last after you and mess you up, there in lies the flaw with the logic
[14:08:33] <ajpiano> Godfather_: see ?jqf
[14:08:33] <bot-t> Godfather_, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:08:46] <ekkis> hightekvagabond: so right now my problem is that I the script that is running is available within $('script') but I don't know which of the entries is the one that represents the current code... any ideas?
[14:09:02] <botfather> i like the jquery chapter in the oreilly js book
[14:09:18] <winterpk> ajpiano: sorry I missed your question
[14:09:20] <botfather> cause i need to pickup on javascript as well
[14:09:38] <ajpiano> winterpk: why aren't you using the maxHeight option
[14:09:56] <winterpk> ajpiano: because maxHeight is not what I need.  I'm trying to make it so the appointments cannot overlap
[14:09:56] <ekkis> hightekvagabond: I thought document.location might tell me but that actually shows me the location of the document loading the js library, not the location of the library itself
[14:09:57] <janthony> I think I need to do something like after: function(currSlideElement, nextSlideElement, options, forwardFlag){ this.style.removeAttribute('filter'); } - but doesn't seem to work
[14:10:07] <Godfather_> thx ajpiano
[14:10:15] <janthony> Doing that as a call back on the after event on .cycle()
[14:11:03] <janthony> after: function(currSlideElement, nextSlideElement, options, forwardFlag){ currSlideElement.style.removeAttribute('filter'); } didn't work either
[14:11:08] <Gulli> Hey
[14:11:12] <Gulli> wondering if anyone could help me
[14:11:20] <Gulli> http://pastebin.com/rqUr1ceh
[14:11:39] <Gulli> trying to put stuff from a json string into an array to use with a plotting function
[14:11:45] <Gulli> the json stiring is at the bottom
[14:11:51] <Gulli> and the commented out thing works
[14:11:56] <Gulli> but not the uncommented
[14:11:57] <Druid_> wtf
[14:11:57] <Druid_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=S2SUaoVy_iU
[14:12:00] <Gulli> anyone know why?
[14:12:07] <hightekvagabond> ekkis: sorry… interesting problem and I'd like to chew on it with you but everyone else is packed, time to load in the car to go to a far away place where they don't know what internet is for 5 days… a mystical land known as Iowa
[14:12:24] <datlap> i use load() to display markers on my map. how can i reload the markers when user clicks prev,next (which displays the next/prev 10 results)
[14:13:53] <ekkis> Gulli: the jason string is what your json.php returns I gather?
[14:14:01] <Gulli> yes
[14:14:34] <ekkis> then you don't need to do anything.  data will contain the array and you can dereference it like: data[2].a
[14:15:04] <winterpk> ajpiano: Any ideas on how to accomplish that?  I've tried dynamically creating containment divs, but that didn't seem to work.  I suppose I could calculate maxHeight, but it would differ based on if they drag up or down.  How do I tell which way they are resizing ?
[14:15:19] <Gulli> hmm, so id use a for loop instead stopping at lenth? doing data[i].a and b?
[14:15:23] <Gulli> length
[14:17:36] <ajpiano> winterpk: trying something
[14:18:43] <winterpk> ajpiano: I think you might be right.  I need to dynamically calculate max height based on if they are resizing up or down and neighboring appointment cells.
[14:22:27] <ajpiano> winterpk: seems like that
[14:22:40] <ajpiano> i tried something like calling soem of the internal mouse API
[14:22:45] <ajpiano> to see if i could trigger the mouseUp
[14:22:57] <ajpiano> and it kinda worked but then the next time you select it, it reverts to its original size
[14:22:57] <winterpk> ajpiana: is there anyway to tell if they are going up or down?
[14:24:47] <ajpiano> you could try something like tracking the actual resize events and finding the delta between the position of the last one and the current one
[14:24:51] <ajpiano> i can mock something up
[14:25:52] <emkei> hello All
[14:26:23] <janthony> I'm not having any luck. Anyone able to get .fadeIn() or .cycle() plugin to fade smoothly in iE8 with text that's on a transparent background?
[14:26:46] <emkei> have a quick question I need to create buttons on the fly and do not want to assign button handler to each element is it possible
[14:27:27] <winterpk> ajpiano: Thank you. That would be very helpful if you are willing. I'm still kinda new to jquery development.
[14:31:14] <ekkis> janthony: did you look at the site I shared with you?
[14:31:31] <winterpk> ajpiano: I think I might have it.  On start event I can just check ui.originalPosition.top against ui.position.top and see if it changed.  If so, then they are draggin up.  Otherwise its down.
[14:31:33] <janthony> ekkis: Yeah, that site doesn't fade text, only images :P
[14:31:45] <ajpiano> yep :)
[14:31:46] <ajpiano> there you go
[14:31:47] <ekkis> janthony: ah... sorry then
[14:31:59] <ajpiano> that's better than what i was doing lol
[14:32:08] <winterpk> thanks for talking me through it =)
[14:32:29] <ajpiano> you don't want to see "if it changed" so much as you want to see if the difference between those two values is more than 0 (down) or less than 0 (up)
[14:32:42] <winterpk> right
[14:33:59] <janthony> I fifgured something like this: http://pastie.org/2911400 - would fix the issue, but not having any luck on the text transition in IE8 when it's on a transparent background
[14:37:00] <janthony> Every place I look, clear type is suppose to fix it, but not having any luck.
[14:41:03] <janthony> .cycle plugin aside, the same problem exists in IE with jquery's built in fadeIn() and fadeOut()
[14:42:32] <ekkis> janthony: I'm running IE9 - a substantial improvement over 8
[14:47:03] <`WarpKat> anyone here know of a plugin like Overscroll that will let you put an image into a contrained div container so you can move it around?
[14:50:31] <redfox_> hi, i'm using jQuery("#pazientitable tbody tr").click( function () {  to catch the click on row table, but i need to catch the first td elements, the value inside <td></td> ... how can i?
[14:52:07] <thevoice-> hi
[14:52:15] <thevoice-> I have a small question
[14:53:33] <thevoice-> I have a $(div).each(function loop
[14:53:48] <thevoice-> it calls a PHP script from within which returns a response each time
[14:54:08] <thevoice-> now what I want is for each div to change to a loading image as it calls the PHP script
[14:54:33] <thevoice-> so for that I put $(this).html('<img src="images/ajax-loader.gif"/>');
[14:54:58] <thevoice-> now instead of changing just the DIV it is currently working on, it changes all of them
[15:08:58] <Barryville1> can someone tell me why when I run thru "expand" and then "close" a second time the box doesn't load the ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/gaby/N6Jkw/1/
[15:09:35] <Bheam> hi
[15:11:06] <Bheam> i have a $(submitbtn).click() {...} on a submitbutton, but i also have <input type="submit" ... onclick="if (!VerifyData()) return false;"> that cancels submission if the verification fails... but that doesn't work when i hooked into the button with jquery
[15:11:13] <emkei> what should I use for event delegation: on or delegate?
[15:11:23] <Bheam> the jquery hook still gets executed and i can find no way to detect that it has been cancelled
[15:12:27] <Bheam> any suggestions?
[15:13:33] <Barryville1> can someone tell me why when I run thru "expand" and then "close" a second time the box doesn't load the ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/gaby/N6Jkw/1/
[15:22:13] <datlap> my search results are displayed using ajax pagination. how do i hook prev/next to load() {map.setCenter...}  since load() only gets loaded once?
[15:25:49] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363 my add_field and remove_field function cause jquery to scroll back to the top of the page rather acknowledging the return false and not scrolling to the top. how can i keep it from scrolling up to the top of the page.
[15:25:53] <Eaven> how do i make mobile safari not jump to the fucking top of the screen after clicking a jq button link ;x
[15:25:58] <Eaven> :(
[15:26:00] <Eaven> lol
[15:26:05] <Eaven> i love logs
[15:30:25] <TehCodr> how do I make an offset animate?
[15:34:24] <TehCodr> how do I animate and offset something? I want a partially shown element to slide down, when you mouse over it
[15:40:20] <kedarm> Can I add a handler to a form input element such that it gets called when that element _loses_ the focus?
[15:42:28] <Raynos> If I wanted to emulate the browser event model, is there a reference library that does this which isn't as complex as jQuery ?
[15:42:28] <aaronmcadam> ?blur kedarm
[15:42:29] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Couldn't find "blur kedarm" in jQuery Docs.
[15:42:31] <kedarm> The behavior I need is when f1 (the first input field) loses the focus and has some value, I should disable f2
[15:42:35] <aaronmcadam> ?blur @kedarm
[15:42:36] <bot-t> kedarm, .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/

[15:42:51] <Raynos> For example, jQuery doesn't use fireEvent, they use their own event model
[15:43:07] <TehCodr> how do I smoothly animate/reposition a css element?
[15:43:19] <aaronmcadam> you mean property?
[15:43:26] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: thanks!
[15:43:29] <TehCodr> like a div tag
[15:43:35] <aaronmcadam> no worries, come back to me if ur stuck kedarm
[15:43:59] <TehCodr> say I have #hover-over, who's height is -15%, so only a small part is jutting out
[15:44:00] <aaronmcadam> TehCodr: you can use $.fn.animate
[15:44:08] <aaronmcadam> on any CSS property that makes sense to animate
[15:44:11] <TehCodr> I tried, but it jumps...
[15:44:18] <aaronmcadam> e.g. display, z-index
[15:44:54] <aaronmcadam> it might be jumping due to your other css rules like abs positioned stuff
[15:45:14] <TehCodr> ty :D
[15:45:16] <aaronmcadam> those examples were on what *not* to animate btw
[15:45:18] <TehCodr> I'll check it out
[15:45:34] <TehCodr> :P
[15:45:40] <aaronmcadam> what does slideDown do for u?
[15:45:51] <aaronmcadam> I don't actually know what effect u want heh
[15:46:05] <TehCodr> dunno, didn't know I could do $.offset(blah).slideDown()...
[15:46:15] <TehCodr> I did want it to slide down :P
[15:47:24] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: It says Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'focusout' ? :(
[15:47:33] <ScottO_> how do i run one ajax after another?
[15:47:55] <ScottO_> curently i have 2 that run at the same time and the resulting actions cause conflict
[15:48:06] <ScottO_> does .ajax have a callback?
[15:48:11] <coldhead> it does!
[15:48:13] <coldhead> use that :)
[15:48:17] <coldhead> ?ajax @ ScottO_
[15:48:17] <bot-t> ScottO_, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:48:22] <coldhead> check the docs
[15:48:25] <ScottO_> i did, and its not running the callback
[15:48:48] <coldhead> then something is going wrong
[15:48:55] <coldhead> and jquery doesn't think it has been successful
[15:49:01] <coldhead> and isn't running the success handler
[15:49:03] <coldhead> and is ashamed
[15:49:14] <ScottO_> callback different than the callback on an event?
[15:49:43] <ScottO_> ooh
[15:49:43] <coldhead> $.ajax('someurl', {success:function () {alert('sup')}})
[15:49:58] <ScottO_> nm i guess ill use the 'complete' callback
[15:50:05] <ScottO_> i needed to it run even without success
[15:50:15] <coldhead> very good
[15:50:16] <ScottO_> just needed them to be sequential run
[15:50:27] <coldhead> right, callbacks ahoy then
[15:50:32] <ScottO_> thx
[15:50:48] <coldhead> good luck!
[15:50:58] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: how are u calling it
[15:51:14] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: you need to make sure you're wrapping ur obj with jQuery u know
[15:51:17] <aaronmcadam> $()
[15:52:13] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: $("#external_url_field").focusout(function(e) {});
[15:52:23] <aaronmcadam> which version of jq?
[15:52:52] <kedarm> 1.6.4
[15:53:20] <aaronmcadam> ?focusout
[15:53:21] <bot-t> .focusout(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusout" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[15:53:26] <aaronmcadam> check the docs, that's strange
[15:54:23] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: Yeah, the example however binds the handler to the "p" element and not the text-field inside it!
[15:54:51] <aaronmcadam> that shouldn't matter
[15:54:59] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: make a jsfiddle plz
[15:55:49] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: OK
[15:58:47] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/aXDTL/ (Still a n00b, be kind :) )
[15:59:40] <aaronmcadam> why the noConflict?
[15:59:45] <aaronmcadam> haha your global is fun
[16:00:09] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: I am just following advices ;) noConflict for there's a use of prototype.js elsewhere.
[16:00:46] <aaronmcadam> lol u put ur js in the html pnae
[16:00:50] <aaronmcadam> pane
[16:01:14] <aaronmcadam> and u didn't include any html?
[16:01:29] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:01:34] <aaronmcadam> I know the problem kedarm
[16:01:44] <aaronmcadam> THIS_PAGE.external_url_field is a DOM object
[16:01:52] <aaronmcadam> external_url_field: j("#job_post_external_url")[0],
[16:02:37] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/mAwt5/
[16:04:03] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: you're almost there with ur object, you should use the revealing module pattern to return a public api too
[16:04:12] <aaronmcadam> so u can keep private stuff private
[16:04:28] <aaronmcadam> so u can change what actually happens in your object but keep the same API
[16:04:42] <aaronmcadam> or rather the *how* it does its stuff
[16:06:51] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: I am still digesting what you said there (e.g. didn't know about revealing module pattern).
[16:06:56] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: but thank you!
[16:07:00] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:07:09] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: it's not that different from what u have there
[16:07:23] <teadict> how come the Aristo famous theme is not in the ThemeRoller?
[16:07:37] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: yeah, and in a hurry, I even placed js in html on jsfiddle. silly me :)
[16:07:52] <aaronmcadam> one sec I'll edit it to show u how
[16:08:38] <ajpiano> teadict: the aristo theme is there to show that one can apply as much custom theming as one wants to the jquery ui css framework
[16:08:43] <ajpiano> it's not availalbe in themeroller
[16:09:00] <teadict> can I include it?
[16:09:01] <teadict> somehow
[16:09:43] <aFtAb> Hello, Is there a way for jquery to detect if there is some other javascript code trying to open popup from a web page and don't let it open
[16:09:44] <teadict> no, that was a silly question
[16:09:58] <atxq> I have a div tag above another one and want to move the top div tag below the bottom one. Any suggestions on how I can go about doing this in jquery?
[16:10:25] <aFtAb> teadict: is that answer for me or someone else ?
[16:10:34] <atxq> clone, after and then remove?
[16:10:44] <ajpiano> teadict: you can download it from the dude who published it
[16:11:39] <teadict> ajpiano: yes, I was thinking about the firefox booklet and if it would work with it... mm let's see
[16:12:42] <teadict> if I use the themeroller dev tool in its demo page, it doesn't change
[16:12:52] <teadict> ajpiano: doesn't that mean it's not correctly themed?
[16:13:13] <ajpiano> uhh
[16:13:26] <ajpiano> i don't know how well the bookmarklet works anymore
[16:13:29] <teadict> or did I not understand the objective of the bookmarley?
[16:13:30] <teadict> t
[16:13:36] <teadict> thought so...
[16:13:49] <teadict> so what's the best way to offer theme changing ability for an app?
[16:14:19] <ajpiano> if i wanted that in my app i'd probably look at the themeswitcher and implement something based ont hat
[16:15:26] <teadict> that's what I wanted, ajpiano: thanks
[16:15:31] <imsky> baby
[16:15:43] <imsky> something something satisfy you
[16:17:50] <coldhead> mayonnaise handjob?
[16:18:34] <hobs> hello I would like to sign up for one
[16:19:28] <aaronmcadam> what's the best way to fix this guys: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/mAwt5/
[16:19:47] <aaronmcadam> refactored a dude's code into the module pattern
[16:19:54] <aaronmcadam> seems the context is wrong
[16:20:39] <aaronmcadam> "this.external_url_field is undefined"
[16:25:19] <TehCodr> just posting the results of several jQuery tests:
[16:25:35] <TehCodr> Microsoft CDN is in the lead, 0.05 seconds
[16:25:47] <TehCodr> CDNJS is 0.07 seconds
[16:25:48] <aaronmcadam> tried cloudflar?
[16:25:51] <aaronmcadam> ok cool
[16:25:53] <TehCodr> and google is 0.1 seconds
[16:25:56] <aaronmcadam> RackSpace?
[16:26:06] <TehCodr> rackspace has jquery?
[16:26:13] <aaronmcadam> rackspace cdn
[16:26:15] <TehCodr> I'm talking about external line to other cdns
[16:26:16] <aaronmcadam> I've got one
[16:26:18] <TehCodr> oh
[16:26:19] <TehCodr> cool
[16:26:24] <TehCodr> I'll test it
[16:26:26] <aaronmcadam> it uses that damn can't remember
[16:26:41] <aaronmcadam> that super awesome system a bit like varnish
[16:26:44] <aaronmcadam> wtf is it
[16:27:47] <TehCodr> damn...
[16:28:13] <TehCodr> backspace doesn't compress the files
[16:28:15] <TehCodr> rackspace*
[16:29:43] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: still here?
[16:29:51] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: yes!
[16:29:53] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: look at this now http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/mAwt5/
[16:30:06] <aaronmcadam> you'll get an error but that's cuz there's no html
[16:30:22] <aaronmcadam> took me a while to figure that out, tireddd
[16:30:26] <aaronmcadam> its 00:30 here hah
[16:30:53] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: now do u see the difference?
[16:31:06] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: going through it. Thanks for taking time.
[16:31:18] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[16:32:15] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: so, in theory, your initialize func could change completely but your API would still be the same, in one place at the end of the module
[16:33:17] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: I see. Interesting.
[16:33:22] <aaronmcadam> you could also probably do with a getProperty method
[16:33:45] <aaronmcadam> lemme see
[16:35:19] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: Maybe this is naive, but what does $(APP.page.external_url_field) achieve?
[16:35:34] <aaronmcadam> you've set ur field as a DOM obj
[16:35:38] <aaronmcadam> with the [0]
[16:35:42] <kedarm> right
[16:35:51] <aaronmcadam> you need to wrap it with jq to access methods
[16:36:10] <kedarm> but then isn't j my jq object?
[16:36:24] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah sorry
[16:36:26] <aaronmcadam> one min
[16:37:00] <kedarm> Also, THIS_PAGE should be APP.page?
[16:38:06] <aaronmcadam> that's what I've done
[16:38:13] <aaronmcadam> to namespace ur app
[16:38:17] <aaronmcadam> if u read all the comments
[16:38:47] <Putr> hey just a quick question:  How do you execute something periodicly with jquery? ( i whant to execute a function every 3000 ms)
[16:39:06] <aaronmcadam> ?setInterval @ Putr
[16:39:06] <bot-t> Putr, http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[16:39:11] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[16:39:20] <Putr> thanks
[16:39:24] <danheberden> ?g setInterval mdc @ Putr
[16:39:25] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn setInterval @ Putr
[16:39:26] <bot-t> Putr, Animating with javascript: from setInterval to requestAnimationFrame ... - http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/animating-with-javascript-from-setinterval-to-requestanimationframe/
[16:39:26] <bot-t> Putr, window.setInterval - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setInterval
[16:39:33] <danheberden> haha
[16:39:37] <aaronmcadam> that's the one ^^
[16:39:49] <aaronmcadam> oh hey awesome deferred dude :D haha
[16:39:50] <Putr> the second one?
[16:39:56] <aaronmcadam> the MDN one
[16:40:07] <Putr> it works cross browser?
[16:40:30] <aaronmcadam> i'd hope so, the whole internet uses it haha
[16:40:37] <aaronmcadam> must be js 1.2 or something silly
[16:40:49] <danheberden> the erichynds article is really good
[16:41:12] <Putr> 2 bad there isnt a jquery event i could bind to :)
[16:41:20] <aaronmcadam> um
[16:41:25] <aaronmcadam> what event would that be?
[16:41:30] <danheberden> about doing like (function go(){ /* do stuff */; setInterval( go, 500 );}());
[16:41:40] <Eviltwin> What's up?
[16:41:48] <danheberden> Putr, that's like saying "i wish jquery could make strings"
[16:41:50] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah makes sense
[16:41:52] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:41:56] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs @ Putr
[16:41:57] <bot-t> Putr, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[16:42:00] <danheberden> you make strings in javascript :p
[16:42:12] <aaronmcadam> I love the add plugin danheberden
[16:42:17] <aaronmcadam> 1.add(2) it's amazing
[16:42:26] <Putr> ok good point :)
[16:42:30] <aaronmcadam> oh, sorry I meant $.add(1,2)
[16:42:42] <danheberden> Putr, but yeah - easy to get used to the 'jquery' way
[16:43:00] <danheberden> and forget, like, 'shit javascript it pretty damn cool on its own even!'
[16:43:18] <aaronmcadam> i'm mad, just had to stop myself trying to use vim bindings in jsfiddle lol
[16:43:43] <danheberden> if i had a nickel for everytime i've typed ':w' in a jsfiddle
[16:44:04] <Eviltwin> I've gotten pretty good at separating myself
[16:44:12] <danheberden> sounds kinky
[16:44:17] <Eviltwin> Ha
[16:44:38] <Eviltwin> I meant using certain keys one place and other keys in another place
[16:45:15] <aaronmcadam> what's going on here guys, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/mAwt5/
[16:45:21] <aaronmcadam> I know it's probably context related
[16:45:32] <danheberden> aaronmcadam a javascript party?
[16:45:32] <aaronmcadam> but need to go sleep soooon
[16:45:42] <aaronmcadam> haha :@D
[16:46:12] <aaronmcadam> it's the context isn't it
[16:46:24] <aaronmcadam> it's when the init func gets called, this isn't the same maybe
[16:46:45] <coldhead> just put everything in the global scope
[16:46:51] <aaronmcadam> so unless i pass it this to it
[16:46:55] <coldhead> prefix all your vars with window.
[16:47:04] <coldhead> real time saver
[16:47:10] <aaronmcadam> oimg rlyyyy
[16:47:16] <aaronmcadam> ur such a trollbitch :P
[16:47:30] <aaronmcadam> see I just invented a word for u coldhead :D
[16:47:32] <danheberden> aaronmcadam this is DOMWindow
[16:47:41] <coldhead> i'm not trolling, i am solving real world problems
[16:47:43] <coldhead> i am the 99%
[16:47:47] <danheberden> coldhead already has a name, and it's 'handsome lover'
[16:47:55] <coldhead> cha cha cha cha champion
[16:48:01] <coldhead> thanks dan
[16:48:07] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[16:48:22] <coldhead> CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHA CHAMPION
[16:48:32] <aaronmcadam> any ideas
[16:48:37] <aksnowman> hi, I'm working on a slideshow setup, and I have thumbnails at the bottom, essentially wondering what the best way to find the offset/index of the thumbnail that was click'd is. I'd imagine there's something better than .each() and comparing, and more backwards-compatable than data-whatever?
[16:48:55] <danheberden> aaronmcadam reference APP.page directly?
[16:48:58] <aaronmcadam> I might just leave it but was trying to show kedarm how to refactor his code into the module pattern
[16:49:03] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:49:08] <coldhead> aksnowman: index() ?
[16:49:10] <aaronmcadam> that's what I do myself
[16:49:20] <aaronmcadam> was just wondering if this could work
[16:50:14] <aksnowman> lmao, coldhead perfect
[16:50:22] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: i think you need to add the methods you want public onto 'this' and return this; as the module instead of returning the object literal with references to the private function
[16:50:27] <aksnowman> I found the page just as you mentioned it
[16:50:56] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/mAwt5/15/
[16:51:00] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[16:51:08] <Eviltwin> Still not exactly the "right" way to do this
[16:51:18] <Eviltwin> You're using the closure scope
[16:51:21] <Eviltwin> Instead of the object scope
[16:51:27] <Eviltwin> Which means multiple instances can be weird
[16:51:33] <Eviltwin> And you don't have a way to copy it
[16:51:46] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[16:51:51] <ajpiano> yeah, you really want the page to be a constructor, not a "module" per se
[16:51:54] <aaronmcadam> how to do it ajpiano's way then
[16:52:21] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: are u taking all this in, hehe
[16:52:25] <danheberden> btw, potential hepful reading: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[16:52:43] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah I've read it and loads of other stuffs
[16:53:02] <aaronmcadam> just trying to help this dude use a pattern, he was nearly there already
[16:53:20] <danheberden> "finish him!"
[16:53:26] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: yes, I think the encapsulation makes sense.
[16:53:28] <ajpiano> it's not the right pattern though
[16:53:35] <ajpiano> all he needs is a constructor
[16:53:38] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:53:40] <webPragmatist> can i do something like $("#video_shell").children().each().click(function($) { ...
[16:53:46] <ajpiano> oh well
[16:53:49] <ajpiano> maybe not
[16:53:50] <ajpiano> lol
[16:54:00] <aaronmcadam> I was talking about the module pattern, and wanted to show him an example is all
[16:54:01] <danheberden> webPragmatist .click will attach to all in the collection
[16:54:08] <aaronmcadam> i didn't think about the actual use case
[16:54:13] <aaronmcadam> maybe I should have haha
[16:54:17] <danheberden> $( '#whatever' ).children().click( fn )
[16:54:18] <webPragmatist> so children().click() is sufficient?
[16:54:20] <webPragmatist> chtcha
[16:54:22] <webPragmatist> gotcha8
[16:54:46] <danheberden> then look into event delegation someday
[16:55:01] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:55:14] <danheberden> $( '#whatever' ).on( 'click', '.someSelector', fn );
[16:55:16] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam http://jsfiddle.net/mAwt5/16/ ?
[16:55:18] <ajpiano> is that better?
[16:55:45] <aaronmcadam> ahh right
[16:56:14] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:56:26] <danheberden> ajpiano you're still puting that this on window
[16:56:34] <aaronmcadam> is that better than the way I was returning the API, or is it just for this specific example?
[16:56:34] <Eviltwin> Here are three different ways of making effectively the same object: http://jsfiddle.net/jrpZA/
[16:56:35] <danheberden> 'this' is going to be window
[16:56:42] <ajpiano> oh ffuuu
[16:56:51] <danheberden> i mean, coldhead said it's oik
[16:56:53] <danheberden> *ok
[16:57:04] <Eviltwin> So you can do me.getName() or me.setName("John")
[16:57:08] <aaronmcadam> you can't namespace it?
[16:57:10] <ajpiano> change the iife to .call( {} , j );
[16:57:14] <danheberden> aye
[16:57:36] <aaronmcadam> an empty obj?
[16:57:40] <coldhead> s/iife/Alman function/
[16:57:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:58:22] <danheberden> s/s\/iife\/Alman function\//s\/iife\/Alman function\/g/
[16:59:27] <ngharo> yo dawg...
[16:59:28] <imsky> what the hell's going on here
[16:59:31] <imsky> with the almans
[16:59:31] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: I put this in place, but somehow, when the field loses focus, focusout is not called (it does not hit my breakpoint :( )
[16:59:52] <aaronmcadam> can u fiddle ur updated code?
[17:00:03] <kedarm> I updated your fiddle
[17:00:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah but u don't get to write to the base
[17:00:22] <aaronmcadam> so I've not idea what rev ur on
[17:01:02] <kedarm> http://jsfiddle.net/mAwt5/17/
[17:01:27] <aaronmcadam> kedarm: you're passing the callback wrong
[17:01:36] <aaronmcadam> there u are calling it instead of passing it, remove the ()
[17:02:18] <aaronmcadam> and u wanna be using this workaround http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/XWf8w/
[17:02:40] <aaronmcadam> but I've really gotta go now so good luck
[17:02:45] <aaronmcadam> 01:02 :S
[17:02:47] <kedarm> aaronmcadam: thanks, got it
[17:03:03] <aaronmcadam> cool man night all
[17:03:56] <ryanneufeld> anyone had issues with accented chars in json?
[17:04:07] <coldhead> hell yes, ryanneufeld
[17:04:16] <coldhead> my solution is EVERYONE JUST SPEAK ENGLISH, PLS
[17:04:34] <ryanneufeld> ENGLISH ALL THE THINGS!!!!
[17:04:55] <ryanneufeld> so is there a solution other than preprocessing the string?
[17:06:15] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: ?
[17:07:56] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: What's up?
[17:08:19] <ryanneufeld> I think this might be a php issue, now
[17:08:24] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna head over to ##php
[17:08:28] <Eviltwin> Are you using json_encode?
[17:08:53] <ryanneufeld> yes
[17:09:38] <ryanneufeld> I'm using utf8_encode as well
[17:09:41] <ryanneufeld> M\u00c3\u00a9xico
[17:09:43] <ryanneufeld> getting that
[17:09:48] <ryanneufeld> which is better than Mxico
[17:09:54] <ryanneufeld> which is what I was getting before
[17:10:04] <Eviltwin> Just json_encode should work
[17:10:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's not
[17:10:38] <Eviltwin> What's happening?
[17:11:12] <ryanneufeld> Mxico instead of Mexico with the accented e
[17:11:34] <ryanneufeld> México
[17:11:40] <ryanneufeld> is what is in our DB
[17:11:53] <ryanneufeld> among others like some arabic
[17:12:09] <ryanneufeld> and asian hyroglyphics
[17:13:51] <Eviltwin> What shows up in the JSON?
[17:14:47] <ryanneufeld> Mxico instead of Mexico with the accented e
[17:14:55] <Eviltwin> No \u anything?
[17:15:02] <ryanneufeld> if I use utf8 encode yes
[17:15:08] <ryanneufeld> M\u00c3\u00a9xico
[17:15:43] <Eviltwin> If I do echo json_encode("\0"); in PHP, I get back literally: "\u0000"
[17:16:19] <ryanneufeld> fuuu
[17:16:21] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: What shows up in the json before sending to the client?
[17:16:34] <ryanneufeld> FFS i just answered that
[17:16:38] <ryanneufeld> M\u00c3\u00a9xico
[17:16:57] <ryanneufeld> but this is how the browser sees it "MÃ©xico"
[17:17:03] <ryanneufeld> which probably means it's utf-16
[17:17:10] <ryanneufeld> fuuu
[17:18:17] <ryanneufeld> I have some code that will change the é to &eacute;
[17:18:27] <ryanneufeld> which I suppose is fine
[17:18:28] <Eviltwin> Why?
[17:18:37] <Eviltwin> That's an HTML escape
[17:18:43] <ryanneufeld> yes, I know
[17:18:46] <ChrisPartridge> Is your php code setting the utf8 charset in a header?
[17:18:57] <ryanneufeld> should be
[17:19:14] <ryanneufeld> it's json datatype though
[17:19:35] <Eviltwin> JSON is always ASCII
[17:19:44] <ryanneufeld> okay
[17:19:49] <ryanneufeld> I've figured that part out now
[17:19:50] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[17:19:55] <ryanneufeld> but when using M\u00c3\u00a9xico in the console.
[17:20:05] <ryanneufeld> it turns into "MÃ©xico"
[17:20:38] <ryanneufeld> ?eval thing = 'M\u00c3\u00a9xico';
[17:20:48] <ryanneufeld> ?eval thing = 'M\u00c3\u00a9xico'; thing
[17:20:55] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: "MÃ©xico"
[17:20:55] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: "MÃ©xico"
[17:20:59] <ryanneufeld> ah
[17:21:00] <ryanneufeld> see
[17:21:02] <ryanneufeld> WTF
[17:21:52] <ryanneufeld> it's multibyte chars, that's why
[17:22:00] <Eviltwin> Well...yeah
[17:22:07] <Eviltwin> It's UTF
[17:22:16] <ryanneufeld> السعودية
[17:22:17] <webPragmatist> can i make firebug ignore a script
[17:22:17] <webPragmatist> like swfobject
[17:22:17] <webPragmatist> it keeps hanging up
[17:22:27] <ryanneufeld> webPragmatist: no
[17:22:31] <minna> Is it possible to collect the response that another js function is calling and not jquery?

[17:22:52] <minna> fuck im tired
[17:22:59] <Eviltwin> Holy crap
[17:23:00] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yeah, this isn't utf-8 though, it's utf-16
[17:23:36] <tokam> which wysiwyg editor could you recommend me?
[17:24:28] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery rich text editor @ tokam
[17:24:30] <bot-t> tokam, 10 jQuery and non-jQuery javascript Rich Text Editors | Queness - http://www.queness.com/post/212/10-jquery-and-non-jquery-javascript-rich-text-editors
[17:24:56] <tokam> thx
[17:25:01] <krogant> hi, is there such a plugin yet that will play audio files when i want to trigger them?
[17:25:04] <ryanneufeld> tokam: np
[17:25:15] <krogant> either with the flash player or html5 audio player?
[17:25:19] <ryanneufeld> krogant: see ?dygit
[17:25:26] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Couldn't find "dygit" in jQuery Docs.
[17:25:28] <ryanneufeld> krogant: see ?dygi
[17:25:35] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: i usually get europeans like nlogax to help with their fruity european characters
[17:25:36] <bot-t> krogant, The Digi Deli Blog  Fed up with trying to fit everything we wanted to ... - http://www.thedigideli.com/blog/
[17:25:41] <coldhead> utf-8 all the things
[17:25:43] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:25:45] <coldhead> ?utf-9/11
[17:25:46] <bot-t> ✈∏∏ NEVER FORGET
[17:25:51] <ryanneufeld> lol
[17:25:59] <ryanneufeld> I shouldn't laugh at that
[17:26:02] <Eviltwin> Huh: $("#json").text(JSON.stringify($("#input").text()));
[17:26:02] <Eviltwin> console.log("Output: "+$("#output").text());
[17:26:02] <ryanneufeld> I'm going to hell
[17:26:21] <krogant> thanks ryanneufeld i'll check it out
[17:26:21] <coldhead> it's funny because it's unicode
[17:26:29] <tokam> TinyMCE - non-jQuery looks impressive
[17:26:31] <coldhead> if you laugh, the terrorists lose
[17:26:31] <tokam> like MS word xD
[17:26:31] <ryanneufeld> krogant: I meant "did you google it"
[17:27:05] <webPragmatist> any of you know if with vimeo you can "start" the player with javascript?
[17:27:05] <ryanneufeld> tokam: it is, but it's massive, and not very well documented
[17:27:19] <ryanneufeld> webPragmatist: dude, they have an api, check it out
[17:27:51] <webPragmatist> yea i am trying to figure it out…. the player api doesn't seem to do what i want unless i am missing the point
[17:27:51] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: did you sort out your json issue?
[17:27:58] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:27:59] <tokam> looks good but seems to be complicated to install http://code.google.com/p/jwysiwyg/
[17:28:07] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: are you explicity calling utf8_encode?
[17:28:12] <ryanneufeld> ChrisPartridge: yes
[17:28:20] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: ensure your document is utf8, and then remove it
[17:28:28] <ChrisPartridge> read first comment here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php
[17:29:08] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/egtXf/1/

[17:29:12] <bot-t> ChrisPartridge: "MÃ©xico"
[17:29:39] <coldhead> gross
[17:30:03] <krogant> does this show anything ? http://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/
[17:30:06] <krogant> i see a blank page
[17:30:51] <Eviltwin> Maybe JSON does support unicode: http://www.json.org/string.gif
[17:32:02] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yes, but for some reason, the accented e in our DB is TWO unicode chars
[17:33:08] <ryanneufeld> ?eval ""M\xe9xico";

[17:33:24] <Putr> I'm trying to do this: $(".slider-front-active")[0].attr("id"); but the function stops execution at this point (i can tell cuz console.logs do not show after it, but  only up untill it, it's in a loop). There are multiple item with that class
[17:33:41] <Eviltwin> Why do you have a [0]?
[17:33:48] <ryanneufeld> $(".slider-front-active").first().attr("id");
[17:33:58] <Putr> maby my jquery is a bit out of date :)
[17:33:59] <krogant> actually, is mp3 supported in html 5?
[17:34:01] <ryanneufeld> [0] will give you the dom elemenrt
[17:34:12] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: you see my eval there?
[17:34:20] <Putr> ryanneufeld: thanks! that clears it up
[17:34:37] <ryanneufeld> Putr: good now see ?get()
[17:34:38] <bot-t> Putr, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[17:34:45] <ryanneufeld> Putr: that's what you're doing with []
[17:34:47] <Eviltwin> The layers of conversions that happen before the text gets to my client
[17:35:06] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/egtXf/2/
[17:35:27] <Eviltwin> Looks fine there to me
[17:35:31] <Putr> ryanneufeld: ok, good to know, i'll read it up (it's 2:35 AM here, so i mite not be the most efficiant programer atm)
[17:35:33] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/egtXf/3/
[17:35:54] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: bad name is what utf8_encode produces for me
[17:36:12] <Eviltwin> So either it was misencoded in the database
[17:37:24] <ryanneufeld> coming from an iphone
[17:37:44] <Eviltwin> How'd it get from the iPhone?
[17:37:58] <ryanneufeld> its the api our iphone app uses
[17:38:10] <ryanneufeld> and our chrome extension
[17:38:36] <Eviltwin> Could be misencoded when it comes in the PHP
[17:38:47] <tokam> I am having the issue that the wysiwyg editor repositions my textarea and removes it's label I use now http://code.google.com/p/jwysiwyg/
[17:38:51] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: whats the data look like before you run utf8_encode over it?
[17:39:13] <ryanneufeld> السعودية
[17:39:18] <tokam> *the label is not removed but wrapped into the border of my editor
[17:39:54] <ryanneufeld> or ישראל
[17:40:04] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: Ok, and what encoding is the db using?
[17:40:22] <ryanneufeld> utf8_general_ci
[17:40:47] <ryanneufeld> oh, the fun part, you can't change that without re-making the table :S
[17:41:07] <ryanneufeld> mb_convert_encoding($string, "UTF-8") solves my problem though
[17:41:32] <ChrisPartridge> yeah - your trying to convert from a unicode to utf8 with utf8_encode - as per my prior link
[17:41:47] <ryanneufeld> ChrisPartridge: yeah, That was intentional
[17:41:57] <dogarrhea2> anyone else notice the bug at http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#snap-to for the 80x80 grid?
[17:42:01] <dogarrhea2> in chrome
[17:42:01] <ryanneufeld> ChrisPartridge: I was simply tracing through the possible options
[17:42:09] <dogarrhea2> a bug on the demo page
[17:42:12] <ChrisPartridge> ryanneufeld: encoding is a bitch :-)
[17:42:16] <ryanneufeld> ChrisPartridge: "For UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS2 and UCS4, encoding detection will fail always."  http://ca3.php.net/manual/de/function.mb-detect-order.php :s
[17:42:50] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: What about it?
[17:42:56] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: what bug?
[17:43:23] <dogarrhea2> sometimes when you drag the 80x80 grid div around and try to drag it back to the original position, it's not in the same place as where it started
[17:43:30] <dogarrhea2> it's off by 10-20 pixels
[17:43:35] <ryanneufeld> nope
[17:43:41] <ryanneufeld> sure isn't
[17:43:50] <ryanneufeld> those boxes are 90x80 ;)
[17:44:30] <dogarrhea2> hrm so the draggable grid function is broken then
[17:44:36] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:44:44] <ryanneufeld> your understanding if it is :p
[17:44:48] <ryanneufeld> check it
[17:44:54] <ryanneufeld> there is a 90x80 box
[17:45:17] <ryanneufeld> which also appears to have some kind of border on it
[17:45:37] <ryanneufeld> and you're dragging the 90x80 grid around on an 80x80 grid
[17:45:51] <dogarrhea2> i know but you'd expect it to snap back to the original position instead of 10 to the left
[17:45:52] <ryanneufeld> so it's not gonna line up exactly cause the math is off
[17:45:54] <dogarrhea2> which i am experiencing
[17:46:28] <dogarrhea2> it just doesn't go back to original position. somehow if you think about it, it should
[17:46:37] <dogarrhea2> since it's using a grid.
[17:46:49] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[17:46:58] <dogarrhea2> if you walk forward 10 feet and walk back 10 feet you won't be 1 feet before you started heh
[17:46:59] <ryanneufeld> just maybe, you're on to something
[17:47:19] <ryanneufeld> Its working the same for me though
[17:47:56] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: it works fine for me in chrome and ff
[17:47:58] <ryanneufeld> on mac
[17:48:00] <ryanneufeld> chrome 17
[17:48:04] <ryanneufeld> ff 8.0.1
[17:48:13] <dogarrhea2> hrm i am in 15
[17:48:54] <ryanneufeld> psh
[17:48:58] <ryanneufeld> that's Ooooold
[17:49:30] <ryanneufeld> ChrisPartridge, Eviltwin thanks for talking through stuff w/  me
[17:49:42] <Eviltwin> No problem
[17:50:01] <ryanneufeld> that mb_change_encoding worked a treat
[17:50:03] <dogarrhea2> yea it seems that you get non zero numbers in the least significant digits for the offsets
[17:50:15] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[17:50:39] <dogarrhea2> somehow multiplying 80 by some non-zero number enables non multiples of 0
[17:50:49] <dogarrhea2> (in the least sig)
[17:51:12] <Eviltwin> I presumed grid had something to do with the position within the parent
[17:51:19] <Zackko> how do i unbind an .ajaxComplete event?
[17:51:20] <Eviltwin> Not relative to the element's current position
[17:56:41] <tokam> does that editor only style the content on editation? http://code.google.com/p/jwysiwyg/
[17:57:04] <tokam> how can I send the styled content to my server?
[17:57:14] <tokam> I always recieve plain text
[17:57:35] <Eviltwin> Have you tried asking in #jwysiwyg ?
[17:57:39] <Eviltwin> This is #jquery
[17:59:40] <tokam> Oh no sorry I just had a striptags filter on my server )=
[18:00:00] <ryanneufeld> tokam: have you tried reading the docs? Have you googled it?
[18:00:31] <tokam> of course i do ryanneufeld i just forgot i have a striptags active on my server
[18:00:48] <tokam> i must somehow manage now to filter script tags on server side
[18:00:58] <tokam> to avoid xss attacs
[18:01:18] <ryanneufeld> tokam: http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php
[18:01:21] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[18:01:25] <Eviltwin> That's like not allowing data to be sent to your server to prevent XSS
[18:01:29] <Datamosh> #php? lol
[18:01:35] <ryanneufeld> Datamosh++
[18:02:50] <tokam> ryanneufeld: http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php#89453
[18:03:12] <ryanneufeld> tokam: that's fantastic....
[18:03:30] <tokam> if it works, did you ever test it?
[18:03:41] <ryanneufeld> tokam: why would I?
[18:04:05] <tokam> to avoid XSS Attacks together with wysiwyg editors =)
[18:05:41] <Datamosh> Tokam, use http://htmlpurifier.org/
[18:06:26] <Zackko> i tried to attach .live('load'…. to an element, waiting for it to load in the future and then perform something on it, then unbind, but its not working lol. any thoughts?
[18:06:30] <minna> Im trying to send some json data usin .ajax, but it doesn't seem to send json. Isn't it this parameter i set to send json? : dataType: "json",
[18:07:34] <minna> Instead of json, it uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[18:07:58] <Eviltwin> ?.ajax @ minna
[18:07:59] <bot-t> minna, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:08:05] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to dataType
[18:08:11] <Eviltwin> Read the first sentence
[18:08:38] <tokam> what a silly code if(0)
[18:09:07] <AfroTurf> if i have <div><h1>title</h1><p>blah....</p></div> how do i append into div but after h1?
[18:09:28] <Eviltwin> $("h1").after("<div>Foo!</div>");
[18:09:36] <Datamosh> Zackko, maybe same question here? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2548479/jquery-live-on-load-event
[18:10:05] <minna> Eviltwin: Ah, it's for the response right? but how do i set for post?
[18:10:11] <tokam> I think the guy is taking the piss out of us
[18:10:14] <Eviltwin> minna: You read that page
[18:10:37] <minna> Eviltwin: i read this page.
[18:10:45] <Eviltwin> minna: It tells you on there
[18:10:47] <Eviltwin> Which one you use
[18:11:18] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: nice insertAfter does the trick :)
[18:11:24] <AfroTurf> thx
[18:11:25] <Eviltwin> AfroTurf: Yup, it's just the reverse
[18:11:56] <AfroTurf> ya i was appendingTo just so i could change with the new object in one line
[18:12:03] <AfroTurf> chain
[18:12:20] <minna> Eviltwin: Ok, thanks.
[18:12:33] <Eviltwin> minna: It's contentType
[18:13:07] <tokam> Datamosh: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3336582/strip-html-tags-in-zend-framework
[18:14:36] <imsky> o say can you see
[18:15:26] <tokam> I need a list of the tags the wysiwyg can produce
[18:15:52] <imsky> wot
[18:19:09] <dogarrhea2> bah. why can't you combine containment to a parent with a grid for draggables
[18:23:55] <minna> Eviltwin: You sure?
[18:24:14] <minna> Eviltwin: Ah. nvm
[18:26:40] <dogarrhea2> looks like a bug with chrome
[18:26:48] <dogarrhea2> at least the version i'm using..
[18:47:59] <zodiak> hey guys and gals, I am having some weirdness trying to do $.find(...).bind(...) in jquery 1.6.4
[18:48:19] <zodiak> how would I use find to then bind a click callback/function to each element ?
[18:48:31] <Eviltwin> $.find or $(...).find(...)?
[18:48:55] <zodiak> oh. well. $(data).find(...)
[18:49:00] <zodiak> are the two not the same ?
[18:49:24] <Eviltwin> There is no $.find
[18:49:38] <Eviltwin> But a jQuery object has a .find method
[18:49:50] <zodiak> okay.
[18:50:30] <Eviltwin> .bind can bind to a set of elements
[18:50:56] <Eviltwin> What you've written should work fine

[19:15:18] <acidjazz> yup
[19:15:21] <fris> acidjazz just html css and images and you commit changes like you would normally do
[19:15:26] <acidjazz> well i added -moz- o's
[19:15:32] <imsky> time to investigate the crap out of that
[19:15:33] <fris> think you can use jekyl as well to create pages
[19:15:50] <imsky> yep jekyl's pretty hip
[19:15:50] <acidjazz> maybe i need those display:'s
[19:15:51] <imsky> jekyll
[19:15:52] <Eviltwin> TheBen: First, what are you trying to do?
[19:16:05] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev, my problem is that addgame is undefined
[19:16:15] <TheBen> Eviltwin, post to game.php
[19:16:17] <imsky> ah, acidjazz, sorry to say. i'm working on this particular area of cssfx, which parses the properties inside the transition
[19:16:24] <Eviltwin> TheBen: Post what?
[19:16:24] <acidjazz> come to think of it the css demos i found online didnt animate in FF as well
[19:16:27] <imsky> so you'll have to do it manually for now
[19:16:43] <imsky> -moz-transition: -moz-transform 0.5s ease-in @ acidjazz
[19:16:45] <TheBen> Eviltwin, nothing for now
[19:16:56] <chrisvwebdev> TheBen..but how are you using it?  that block of code doesn't show me anything
[19:17:00] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to redirect the apeg?
[19:17:01] <Eviltwin> page*
[19:17:06] <fris> acidjazz from the ansi days? :p
[19:17:08] <chrisvwebdev> are you trying to invoke the method before you define it?
[19:17:10] <TheBen> onclick
[19:17:17] <chrisvwebdev> what onclick?
[19:17:35] <chrisvwebdev> i see this:
[19:17:38] <chrisvwebdev> function addgame(){
[19:17:38] <chrisvwebdev> $.post("game.php");
[19:17:38] <chrisvwebdev> } 
[19:17:58] <acidjazz> imsky: http://pastebin.com/2Pu1qvvv
[19:17:58] <acidjazz> fris: yea :)
[19:18:01] <JohnnyL> How do you set the class for an individual option in a select object?
[19:18:07] <JohnnyL> add a class rather
[19:18:17] <Eviltwin> You can select options
[19:18:18] <chrisvwebdev> plus, jquery has a .click() method...or are you using js onclick instead?
[19:18:20] <imsky> acidjazz: -moz-transition: -webkit-transform 0.2s ease-in;
[19:18:22] <imsky> ^ that's wrong
[19:18:28] <imsky> -moz-transition: -moz-transform
[19:18:32] <acidjazz> oh moz and moz
[19:18:34] <acidjazz> bingo
[19:18:56] <acidjazz> that did it
[19:18:56] <acidjazz> graci
[19:19:10] <imsky> yw
[19:19:19] <acidjazz> fris: i threw this a cpl years ago http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/12/BUBFUD235.DTL
[19:20:18] <chrisvwebdev> how many devs here have upgraded to jquery 1.7?
[19:20:24] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev and Eviltwin, http://pastebin.com/9yfknW4q
[19:20:32] <TheBen> openswf is called and works
[19:20:37] <chrisvwebdev> any issues with backwards compatibility on live sites in the wild?
[19:20:48] <imsky> chrisvwebdev: i have, and no issues except for layerX and layerY errors disappearing
[19:20:49] <fris> i was looking for archives of ansii stuff from diff groups a few weeks ago
[19:20:53] <TheBen> addgame results in function not found error
[19:21:32] <Retistic> does anyone know id next() will return a sibling outside of the current elements div?
[19:21:36] <Retistic> if*
[19:21:41] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev, http://pastebin.com/9yfknW4q
[19:22:01] <Eviltwin> Retistic: siblings by definition are inside the same parent
[19:22:25] <acidjazz> fris: sixteencolors?
[19:22:31] <chrisvwebdev> TheBen: you should end all your statements with ;
[19:23:06] <fris> thanks nice link
[19:23:23] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev, ok but that's not my problem
[19:23:30] <fris> thought jason might have some archive on textfiles.com
[19:24:03] <Retistic> Eviltwin: ah, ok thanks. i have and element <div><a href class="button get-next-button"></a></div><a href class="button"></a>
[19:24:12] <acidjazz> i ened a good way to scroll down a web page ot somewhere.. jquery plugin recommendations?
[19:24:27] <Retistic> Eviltwin: how might i get the next button regardless of parent?
[19:24:39] <fris> acidjazz dont really need a plugin for that
[19:25:10] <fris> acidjazz http://frisx.com/2011/10/31/test-table-of-contents/ click on the items in the table of contents on the right
[19:25:22] <TheBen> Eviltwin, http://pastebin.com/9yfknW4q
[19:25:54] <Retistic> Eviltwin: seems like it should be fairly simple
[19:25:58] <acidjazz> thats perfect fris
[19:26:00] <acidjazz> codes
[19:26:07] <chrisvwebdev> TheBen:  http://jsfiddle.net/6FBAf/3/
[19:26:13] <acidjazz> where the codes at?
[19:26:22] <chrisvwebdev> it works
[19:27:09] <acidjazz> holy 60 js scripts on this page fris
[19:27:28] <fris> heh its not a live site, just a testing ground
[19:28:01] <acidjazz> wheres the scroll code?
[19:28:02] <fris> http://frisx.com/wp-content/themes/cody/js/toc.js is the scrolling part (ignore the top function) just goes to the top by typing up on the keyboard
[19:29:59] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev, openswf is undefined now
[19:30:42] <fris> why not usw swfobject
[19:31:16] <acidjazz> oh i see you bound it to hash links
[19:31:20] <acidjazz> i need this to be automatic
[19:31:25] <acidjazz> and be able to be bound to an element
[19:31:31] <acidjazz> ill just convert this
[19:31:38] <TheBen> fris, I'm going to change it to swfobject later
[19:32:53] <chrisvwebdev> TheBen, how is it undefined?
[19:33:40] <chrisvwebdev> it's there with addgame?  i invoked openswf to call addgame?
[19:33:45] <Retistic> how do i make the first button get the next button with class button?  <div><a href class=button get-next"></a></div>   <a href class=button"></a>
[19:34:02] <chrisvwebdev> you will need to show all the code so i can see what is going on....to see how you are using the methods
[19:34:29] <Eviltwin> Retistic: That's actually non-trivial unless you know some more information.
[19:34:34] <acidjazz> ah k i see .. a .animate
[19:35:20] <chrisvwebdev> http://jsfiddle.net/6FBAf/4/  shows you openswf is properly defined as a 'function'
[19:35:35] <TheBen> chrisvwebdev, I figured it out
[19:35:42] <TheBen> Thanks though
[19:36:20] <Retistic> Eviltwin: There's no function that checks for the next element with a certain class on the page (regardless of child/parent)?
[19:36:48] <Eviltwin> Selectors always return elements in DOM order
[19:37:00] <Eviltwin> So you could select all of them
[19:37:25] <Eviltwin> And then find the one that's after the element you're currently looking at
[19:38:08] <acidjazz> fris: your thing looks for the .top in css()
[19:38:15] <acidjazz> fris: what do you do when theres no .top set?
[19:39:34] <Retistic> Eviltwin: hmm makes sense. its my first day with jquery
[19:41:19] <fris> acidjazz only top is for going to the top, hashtags are mainly what i use for the table of contents since its all generated via a post automatically so i can tell which to goto
[19:42:09] <acidjazz> fris:   scroll: function(obj) { $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: obj.offset().top}, 400) }
[19:42:10] <acidjazz> bingo
[19:43:09] <sickonnet> how to maxlength input that duplicate from others input text
[19:45:15] <sickonnet> can i paste my code here?
[19:46:00] <chrisvwebdev> sickonnet no
[19:46:09] <chrisvwebdev> use jsfiddle.net then give the link
[19:54:29] <sickonnet> http://jsfiddle.net/EuWR2/
[19:55:30] <chrisvwebdev> so what's the problem again?
[19:55:36] <sickonnet> i want to made second input limit to 24 char only when first input type something even longer than 24 char
[19:55:59] <sickonnet> the problem is the second input duplicate the first input cant limit to 24 char
[19:58:36] <chrisvwebdev> so if chars in first input > 24, you want second input to be maxlength=24
[19:58:41] <chrisvwebdev> is that right?
[19:58:43] <sickonnet> yupe
[20:00:38] <Spadeski> if($(this).val() > 24){ //change me}
[20:02:29] <b0ot> I essentially have a table of information that will be updating approx 1/sec what would be a nice way to show the information. I currently display it with a simple table and use jquery to rebuild a table every second
[20:04:40] <coldhead> what's the problem with what you have now?
[20:05:02] <sickonnet> http://jsfiddle.net/EuWR2/6/ here before limit char
[20:05:05] <coldhead> appending or prepending new rows would be more elegant, if that's appropriate
[20:06:15] <sunscreen> hrm
[20:06:28] <sunscreen> i keep getting this Uncaught TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'done'
[20:06:47] <sickonnet> Spadeski: i need duplicate 1 input to second input with limit up to 24 char for second input
[20:06:50] <acidjazz> is it possibel to box-shadow just the bottom of a div?
[20:07:10] <sickonnet> 1st input is still same text what ever it input on that
[20:07:42] <sickonnet> even the char is not up to 24 it also duplicated
[20:08:20] <sickonnet> try add attr('maxlength',24) not work
[20:17:35] <chrisvwebdev> sickonnet: http://jsfiddle.net/EuWR2/20/
[20:19:31] <letterpress> acidjazz yes here are some examples http://www.elektronotdienst-nuernberg.de/bugs/box-shadow_inset.html
[20:20:00] <sickonnet> chrisvwebdev try it now thx u
[20:20:36] <chrisvwebdev> no prob. the key was using the .attr() method based on the value of the first input
[20:20:54] <chrisvwebdev> sorry took so long.  i have to put kids to bed
[20:23:38] <coldhead> aw
[20:26:30] <acidjazz> letterpress: traci
[20:26:32] <acidjazz> graci
[20:26:51] <sickonnet> sorry chris
[20:27:13] <letterpress> np! i've probably been using box-shadow too much lately. i don't know when to say when.
[20:27:13] <ryanneufeld> I love kids
[20:27:16] <sickonnet> but the value from first input not duplicated to second input
[20:27:24] <ryanneufeld> but I can never eat a whole one... always have leftovers
[20:27:26] <sickonnet>   $('#desc').attr('maxlength',24).val($(this).val());
[20:28:08] <letterpress> is $.hoverIntent() the recommended plugin for… hover intent?
[20:28:29] <ryanneufeld> letterpress: I don't know about *the* recommended one, but it's a good one
[20:28:53] <ryanneufeld> letterpress: we use it on www.metrolyrics.com for our nav menu
[20:29:40] <letterpress> ok thanks!
[20:30:45] <coldhead> it was good enough for daniel
[20:31:06] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: who is daniel?
[20:33:33] <imsky> his name was robert paulson
[20:34:36] <coldhead> ?w daniel
[20:34:38] <bot-t> coldhead, Daniel - Daniel (, meaning "God is my Judge") is the protagonist in the Book of Daniel of the Hebrew Bible. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel
[20:40:42] <imsky> good lord
[20:59:55] <joshsmith> if I have html structured like <div><a><div></div></a><a><div>...
[21:00:21] <joshsmith> how can I show true/false for the existence of .current on one of those nested divs?
[21:00:30] <joshsmith> http://jsfiddle.net/CjFyw/3/
[21:01:01] <joshsmith> I need to see if any of those buttons have .current, and remove the .current if so
[21:01:41] <coldhead> $this.siblings().not(this).removeClass('current')
[21:02:03] <joshsmith> ah coldhead, you have been my saviour way too many times
[21:02:16] <coldhead> you don't ask much from a saviour huh
[21:02:28] <coldhead> reach for the stars
[21:02:31] <joshsmith> well, given I'm an idiot, it's a lot for me
[21:02:39] <rpaddock> Is there an issue with .toggle() on IE?
[21:02:39] <coldhead> :D
[21:02:44] <coldhead> good luck
[21:02:53] <coldhead> not that i've ever encountered, rpaddock
[21:05:32] <coldhead> what are you seeing?
[21:07:47] <rpaddock> Having an issue where within an anchor I have 2 spans, 1 hidden, 1 shown, both with the same class. When you click one, it toggles visibility for both. On non-IE, works great. On IE, the first toggle works, but then the next doesn't
[21:08:11] <rpaddock> the 2nd toggle makes both spans hidden
[21:10:34] <tiagofaustino> teste
[21:23:51] <dwarder> i am trying to use this plugin http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#ajax, it works thought when i update my div with ajax request it not working anymore, how can i fix that?
[21:25:01] <dwarder> though*
[21:25:08] <c_t_montgomery> i'm assuming the div you have has the link inside of it that enables the plugin?
[21:26:14] <dwarder> in my div i have a link with with an id by which i assign that plugin
[21:27:09] <dwarder> and when i updated this div, my link content changes, but id remains
[21:27:20] <c_t_montgomery> what version of jquery are you using? if 1.7, you ought to use .on(), if you're using a previous version, use .delegate(), instead of the 'click', which I'm assuming you are using as the handler?
[21:27:43] <dwarder> it is hover in my case
[21:28:08] <dwarder> http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#
[21:28:28] <dwarder> c_t_montgomery: plese click view the source
[21:29:18] <c_t_montgomery> dwarder: with that link you just sent - how can i make the ajax request to view the problem?
[21:30:06] <dwarder> i guess i need to jsfiddle iti
[21:30:10] <c_t_montgomery> ahh
[21:30:13] <c_t_montgomery> no i see
[21:30:15] <dwarder> then
[21:30:17] <c_t_montgomery> i didn't see the "view source" button
[21:30:30] <dwarder> right corner
[21:30:32] <dwarder> top
[21:30:35] <c_t_montgomery> yes. now what's your problem?
[21:30:45] <dwarder> near with download
[21:31:00] <dwarder> c_t_montgomery: tooltip stops working
[21:31:24] <dwarder> i.e. not showing it after div content has been refreshe
[21:31:25] <dwarder> d
[21:31:39] <dwarder> and my jquery version is v1.5.1
[21:32:26] <c_t_montgomery> dwarder: i don't see where it should be working or where it shouldn't be. what did you mean by 'near with download'. where should the tooltip be showing up
[21:32:51] <Zackko> how do i keep the content from flashing before its styled in jquery ui tbas?
[21:32:53] <Zackko> tabs*
[21:33:24] <dwarder> c_t_montgomery: by "near with download" i meant where the view source button is ... this right top corner on the page http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#
[21:34:21] <c_t_montgomery> dwarder: what should i hover over to see it working in one place and not over the other - looks fine to me so far
[21:34:37] <dwarder> c_t_montgomery: and in this source code imagine that you've just updated the content of the first p tag with an ajax
[21:34:52] <dwarder> with the button for example
[21:35:09] <dwarder> i need to jsfiddle that
[21:35:11] <c_t_montgomery> yeah
[21:35:21] <dwarder> so that you don't have to imagine it :)
[21:35:29] <c_t_montgomery> ;)
[21:40:54] <dwarder> i think that could help me http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/tutorials/events/#live
[21:41:28] <Eviltwin> dwarder: Don't use .live
[21:42:31] <coldhead> aw live()'s okay
[21:42:36] <coldhead> there are worse things
[21:42:43] <coldhead> homophobia for instance
[21:43:28] <dwarder> lol
[21:44:11] <c_t_montgomery> don't use live(), plz
[21:44:13] <Eviltwin> .live is wasteful and encourages bad habits
[21:44:15] <c_t_montgomery> truth
[21:44:33] <c_t_montgomery> since you're using jquery < 1.7, just use .delegate to a parent element of your div
[21:45:16] <dwarder> c_t_montgomery: i don't know hot to emulate ajax with jsfiddlle http://jsfiddle.net/mzMvj/
[21:45:41] <dwarder> what i need, i think, is to reinit qtip
[21:45:48] <dwarder> after ajax
[21:45:57] <coldhead> that sounds good
[21:46:45] <dwarder> i wonder how ...
[21:47:15] <coldhead> in your ajax success handler, just do $('*').qtip()
[21:47:22] <coldhead> and that wil qtip all the things
[21:48:02] <c_t_montgomery> that would work great and be easy to implement. thx, coldhead
[21:50:06] <dwarder> thank you guys
[21:50:35] <c_t_montgomery> anytime - hope it helps!

[22:12:10] <Roots47> Hey, quick question... I have a span that sits next to my input boxes, its position is absolute and only appears when there is some validation message that must appear... however everytime I hide and reshow the box, it appears below the textbox instead of next to it
[22:13:24] <Zackko> is there a way to make jquery ui accordians able to open more than one accordian at once?
[22:14:29] <jacky123> in jquery, how do you select a tag inside an iframe ?
[22:14:48] <Eviltwin> jacky123: You can't for security reasons
[22:15:19] <dwarder> why ajax is not working by click http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/
[22:15:21] <jacky123> and the security reasons are ?
[22:15:40] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/1/
[22:16:27] <GoSox> I know $("#id") and $(".class") , is there a way to specify the 'span' tag that's inside #id ?
[22:16:43] <dwarder> '#id span'
[22:16:49] <GoSox> hmm easy enough
[22:17:05] <GoSox> so it's all the same stuff you use in css then?
[22:17:22] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Yes, selectors
[22:17:27] <Eviltwin> ANy more
[22:17:28] <Eviltwin> And more*
[22:17:40] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[22:18:50] <dwarder> why my ajax onclick doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/1/
[22:19:22] <dwarder> works without though
[22:19:35] <thevoice-> HI
[22:19:48] <thevoice-> How do I make a JQUERY while loop pause until it gets a response from a post?
[22:20:05] <Eviltwin> thevoice-: You can't
[22:20:10] <Eviltwin> You use callbacks
[22:20:12] <Roots47> Hey, quick question... I have a span that sits next to my input boxes, its position is absolute and only appears when there is some validation message that must appear... however everytime I hide and reshow the box, it appears below the textbox instead of next to it.  It works fine in IE, however.
[22:20:18] <thevoice-> ?
[22:20:46] <thevoice-> So if I want to loop through each element of a table and change it as the function responds
[22:20:49] <thevoice-> what would I do
[22:21:01] <dwarder> anyone?
[22:21:15] <Eviltwin> thevoice-: You would learn about asynchronous programming
[22:21:34] <Eviltwin> thevoice-: Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[22:21:35] <dwarder> would?
[22:21:44] <Eviltwin> The letters represent the order of execution
[22:23:05] <thevoice-> thanks
[22:31:37] <GoSox> Eviltwin: does it matter where you define a function in a javascript file? I notice that most js has the functions defined at the top. But as a PHPer, I always define my functions at the bottom.
[22:42:02] <Zackko> how can i make these windows resize syncronously with a handle where the red circle is? http://imm.io/c0eP
[22:43:14] <xSk> some Brazilian to help me?
[22:43:41] <sonuloveu> ?
[22:44:15] <Eviltwin> GoSox: No, functions are hoisted
[22:44:27] <manoj> Enter text here...hi
[22:44:32] <Eviltwin> Meaning every function definition is actually dragged to the top before compiling
[22:44:42] <GoSox> ok good
[22:44:56] <manoj> i have problem with code any one can solve it.
[22:45:22] <manoj> hi
[22:45:49] <manoj> how to place <span></span> in element's parent's td to next td
[22:47:12] <Eviltwin> manoj: I can't undersatnd what you're asking
[22:47:53] <xSk> I'm sending a message via post, but if by the bug &!
[22:48:11] <manoj> how to place <span></span> in element's parent's td to next td
[22:48:31] <GoSox> Eviltwin: oh well let me repeat myself word for word then
[22:49:20] <Eviltwin> manoj: I can't undersatnd what you're asking
[22:49:26] <GoSox> Eviltwin: can you put a callback function in any function youve made yourself?
[22:49:40] <Eviltwin> GoSox: How do you mean?
[22:50:19] <GoSox> well i have function a that updates values, then i have function b that checks those very values, and applies various css styles to various parts of the page.
[22:50:35] <redfox75> hi, someone has never used datatable? I would like to make an event when you click on a row ....
[22:51:04] <GoSox> i want to use setInterval to run function A, then function B. I also want function B to run on document load (but not A because at that point, hard coded data will be loaded with the page load)
[22:51:35] <GoSox> but if A and B run at the same time during setInterval, the wrong things will happen
[22:51:50] <GoSox> you get what i'm saying?
[22:52:37] <xSk> I have problems using the jquery POST! can anyone help me?
[22:52:54] <c_t_montgomery> what's your problem? can you make a jsfiddle?
[22:52:55] <Eviltwin> So run B on load, then run A followed by B every interval?
[22:53:31] <GoSox> i guess what i'm asking is, when do functions run at the same time, and when do they run consecutively?
[22:53:51] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Functions never *actually* run at the same time
[22:54:00] <Eviltwin> Let me make an example real quick
[22:54:06] <GoSox> actually wait
[22:54:12] <GoSox> probably easy if you just look at my code
[22:54:16] <GoSox> its pretty simple really
[22:54:17] <Eviltwin> Sure
[22:54:41] <GoSox> so A and B are update_temps() and update_styles()
[22:54:57] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/gHqB6/
[22:55:39] <Eviltwin> So do you know the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
[22:55:59] <GoSox> in theory yes, in how it applies to javascript, not really
[22:56:11] <Eviltwin> What do you know about the theory?
[22:56:48] <GoSox> basically that you can have things that run at the same time, or you can have things that run one after another, where one thing doesn't start until the previous finishes
[22:57:20] <Eviltwin> That's the basics of it
[22:57:27] <Eviltwin> Do you know what threads are?
[22:57:33] <GoSox> indeed i do
[22:57:48] <Eviltwin> Threads are one kind of asynchronous programming
[22:58:03] <Eviltwin> Two different functions are running at the same time
[22:58:04] <GoSox> i have two quad-core processors sitting on my desk waiting to go in my mac pro. the more threads the better
[22:58:53] <Eviltwin> Have you done any thread programming before?
[22:58:58] <GoSox> nope
[22:59:15] <Eviltwin> One of the biggest problems with it
[22:59:17] <redfox75> none expert on datatable?
[22:59:25] <Eviltwin> Is that the two functions aren't necessarily in sync
[22:59:34] <Eviltwin> They can run different bits at different times
[22:59:40] <Eviltwin> They work essentially indepedently
[22:59:44] <Eviltwin> But sometimes you need them to work together
[22:59:51] <Eviltwin> And you need to force them to get in sync
[23:00:00] <Eviltwin> Which is where a lot of pain happens
[23:00:31] <Eviltwin> JavaScript arguably simplified the problem
[23:00:40] <Eviltwin> Only one JavaScript function runs at a given time
[23:00:54] <Eviltwin> If one of your functions is running, no other function will run until your function returns
[23:01:05] <Eviltwin> But there are some things you can do
[23:01:11] <Eviltwin> For example you can use AJAX
[23:01:24] <Eviltwin> Where you start this request and then it runs a callback function when the data is returned
[23:01:40] <Eviltwin> The AJAX keeps on processing in the background, separately
[23:01:46] <Eviltwin> While JavaScript goes on its way
[23:02:29] <Eviltwin> Take a look at this example of synchronous vs. asynchronous functions: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[23:02:36] <Eviltwin> I've labeled the order the code will run in
[23:02:43] <Eviltwin> With letters
[23:02:48] <GoSox> yup i looked at that earlier
[23:03:32] <Eviltwin> So you have one asynchronous call
[23:03:38] <Eviltwin> Which means update_temps() will run and return
[23:03:52] <Eviltwin> And at some point in the future your code in the callback there will run
[23:03:59] <Eviltwin> In the mean time, other timers could fire
[23:04:02] <Eviltwin> And run their code
[23:04:04] <Eviltwin> Etc.
[23:04:58] <Eviltwin> But do you understand what I mean about only one function being able to run at once
[23:05:10] <GoSox> no actually
[23:05:17] <GoSox> looking at your example, for example
[23:05:26] <GoSox> what makes one function synchronous and one asynchronous
[23:05:35] <GoSox> code-wise i mean, why is one one way and one another way
[23:05:50] <Eviltwin> Because of the setTimeout
[23:06:07] <Eviltwin> The functions are there to illustrate the difference between synchronous and asynchronous
[23:06:24] <Eviltwin> There's really no reason you'd ever want this operation to be asyncrhonous
[23:06:30] <Eviltwin> But it's a simple example
[23:06:37] <Eviltwin> So what setTimeout does
[23:06:54] <dissidentat> how can I use javascript to cause actions within an iframe? for example, make the iframe load a page on another website and then change form elements within the iframe and submit them
[23:07:02] <Eviltwin> Is it registers with the JavaScript engine that you'd like the function you pass to be run later
[23:07:11] <Eviltwin> At least 10ms later in this case
[23:07:19] <Eviltwin> So it doesn't run it right away
[23:07:38] <Eviltwin> In fact it won't run it until all other functions stop running (have returned)
[23:09:07] <GoSox> ok so, looking at my code, it's clear I didn't use that technique in any of my questions. But I have no idea what jQuery is doing, i assume it is using those techniques, right?
[23:09:31] <Eviltwin> Well $.get is asynchronous
[23:09:51] <Eviltwin> setTimeout is an example of one of the types of asynchronous functions
[23:10:28] <GoSox> so what I want is an anonymous functoin in setInterval, that runs my update_temps() and then my update_styles()
[23:10:43] <GoSox> and remove teh update_styles call from teh end of update_temp
[23:11:14] <GoSox> then all the asynchronous jquery stuff will still be "contained" within the update_temps() call?
[23:11:15] <Eviltwin> That will actually cause the update_styles to run before the html has been fillde in
[23:11:25] <Eviltwin> One of the issues with asynchronousness
[23:11:52] <Eviltwin> Is if you have an asynchronous function, you can't make it synchronous
[23:12:03] <Eviltwin> You can't make something wait until it's done, it's not possible
[23:13:29] <GoSox> so, like you said to that other guy, what i need is callbacks then? but where would i put a callback to update_styles()?
[23:13:54] <Eviltwin> Where you have it now is rught
[23:14:00] <Eviltwin> If you want it to run after those .html() calls
[23:14:21] <GoSox> i didn't know i had a callback function now
[23:14:34] <Eviltwin>     $.get('update_numbers.php',function($data) {
[23:14:54] <GoSox> oh so just the .get is asynchronous, but not the .html's?
[23:16:08] <Eviltwin> Correct
[23:16:12] <Eviltwin> I put in labels: http://jsfiddle.net/gHqB6/1/
[23:16:14] <GoSox> oh
[23:16:15] <Eviltwin> For the order things run in
[23:16:36] <Eviltwin> (The first time)
[23:16:47] <Eviltwin> F-L happens repeatedly
[23:16:59] <GoSox> oh now i totally get it, i was thinking all of my jquery stuff was asynchronous, so the way i hate it, update_styles was being called before/during/after the .html calls
[23:17:14] <GoSox> hate -> had
[23:17:30] <Eviltwin> Right, it's running after
[23:17:39] <Eviltwin> Because .html is synrchronous
[23:17:51] <Eviltwin> I would say most of jQuery is synchrounous
[23:17:53] <GoSox> ok then i'm golden
[23:18:00] <Eviltwin> It's things that have to do with AJAX and other remote fetching
[23:18:09] <GoSox> Eviltwin: you could have saved yourself a shit load of typing like 20 minutes ago :D
[23:18:10] <dwarder> why my ajax onclick doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/1/
[23:18:12] <Eviltwin> And things that have to do with timers/delays/animations that aren't
[23:18:28] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Well it's important to understand the fundamentals
[23:19:26] <GoSox> i thought i did, and apparently i was right :P when you started talking to that other guy about it earlier, thats when i started to get confused and wondering if my code wasn't going to run as expected
[23:19:56] <GoSox> this page is going to have an awful lot of js code on it
[23:20:18] <GoSox> good thing it's not server-side code (php) because it's running on a 900 MHz mac with 256 MB of ram
[23:21:32] <Eviltwin> I'm amazed how many people still put so much of the work on the server
[23:22:29] <GoSox> things are so optimized on the server. this computer is a dinosaur, and it easily handles all of the database calls and php code and on the fly gzip compression
[23:22:51] <GoSox> on my real server, it hums along at an average 5% CPU load, and my sites get a LOT of traffic
[23:23:00] <dwarder> why cannot i wrap $.ajax into a function?
[23:23:21] <GoSox> and if its running on the server, you KNOW it's running. If it's running in javascript, it's probably going to run
[23:24:09] <Eviltwin> Most of the time if it doesn't run
[23:24:14] <Eviltwin> It's because the client is a bot
[23:24:26] <Cork> dwarder: you can, but i guess your talking about the success callback?
[23:24:41] <GoSox> that may be true, but i can tell you that my php runs 100% of the time, no matter what the requestor is
[23:24:43] <dwarder> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/1/
[23:25:09] <dwarder> i want to execute ajax upon my click
[23:25:10] <GoSox> plus PHP is easier (imo) than javascript. It has a function for everything, the syntax is less weird. it's good stuff
[23:25:43] <Cork> dwarder: that should work just fine, as long as $ is defined so xmlhttpPost can access it
[23:25:57] <dwarder> Cork: why it doesnt?
[23:26:10] <Cork> dwarder: add console.log($) before $.ajax
[23:26:19] <Cork> and see so that variable is jquery
[23:26:29] <GoSox> Eviltwin: if you're wondering what we've been working on, it's this: http://coldmac.macfixer.net:30080/
[23:26:50] <Eviltwin> Control panel or something?
[23:27:05] <GoSox> a weather station, kind of
[23:27:16] <dwarder> Cork: please take a look at the jsfiddle link, $.ajax works, but not when i wrap it in a function, there are both cases
[23:27:20] <Eviltwin> Flash...
[23:28:04] <GoSox> yeah, the graphs are flash
[23:28:43] <Eviltwin> dwarder: You're not running the function...
[23:28:50] <GoSox> those graphs are a massive pain in the ass to configure, but tehy are pretty slick once they are working
[23:28:58] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/2/
[23:29:19] <Cork> dwarder: your defineing xmlhttpPost in domready, thats an event callback
[23:29:43] <Eviltwin> You wanna see a browser slow to a crawl? Load them up with flash
[23:29:50] <Cork> dwarder: so its not globaly accessable, but your trying to access it though inline events that works on the globa scope
[23:30:03] <dwarder> Eviltwin: well i have an onclick in my <a> tag
[23:30:13] <GoSox> i agree, but when the point of a web page is to show graphs, i think putting two flash graphs on that web page is acceptable
[23:30:48] <dwarder> Cork: $(document).ready(function () {} ?
[23:30:51] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/djCmX/3/
[23:31:53] <Cork> dwarder: and as two side notes, you shouldn't use inline events, and you don't need javascript: in event strings
[23:33:37] <enerel1> what is the best plugin for fullscreen background?
[23:33:46] <dwarder> i see now
[23:33:51] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[23:34:01] <Cork> np
[23:49:06] <muhoo> is there an easy/standard way to listen for a 13 (carriage return) inside a listbox, and then execute some callback based on it?
[23:49:21] <muhoo> seems like it''s used all the time for autocomplete
[23:49:53] <Eviltwin> muhoo: $(window).keyup(function(e){if(e.keyCode != 13)return;...});
[23:50:04] <muhoo> awesome, thanks
[23:50:25] <muhoo> will thaat work with $('#someinput') instead of $(window) ?
[23:50:43] <Cork> and you can remove the magic number if you use jquery-ui
[23:51:09] <Cork> $.keyCode.ENTER works then
[23:52:28] <muhoo> right. but i need it to be specific to one element, not $(window)
[23:52:40] * muhoo tries it
[23:52:44] <Cork> muhoo: bind it to that element then
[23:52:49] <muhoo> k, thanks
[23:52:59] <Cork> as long as it can take input it should work fine
[23:53:19] <muhoo> awesome, works!
[23:53:21] <Cork> (in other words, binding it on a div won't work)
[23:59:24] <muhoo> binding it to the input element works great. actually, binding it to a div that encoses the input also works
[23:59:47] <Eviltwin> To expand on what Cork was saying
