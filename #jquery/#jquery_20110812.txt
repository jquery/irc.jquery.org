[00:00:08] <coldhead> the code that can be known is not the eternal code
[00:00:22] <Cork> durre: might be the element is created after the click bind call
[00:00:40] <Weasel1991> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" /> fixes all of my problems coldhead
[00:00:42] <Weasel1991> :p
[00:00:56] <coldhead> omg Weasel1991, i am so sorry to hear that
[00:00:56] <Cork> Weasel1991: ugg..
[00:01:01] <Weasel1991> I know :(
[00:01:02] <Cork> ya
[00:01:04] <coldhead> i hope you can move on with your life
[00:01:09] <coldhead> it will get better!
[00:01:09] <Weasel1991> I cant
[00:01:15] <Weasel1991> But I want to know!
[00:01:16] <coldhead> THERE'LL BE OTHER PROJECTS
[00:01:25] <coldhead> other browsers
[00:01:27] <Weasel1991> :'(
[00:01:47] <Cork> Weasel1991: that means two things, validate the code, and check if your running ie fix code that isn't needed
[00:01:58] <Cork> (in newer versions)
[00:04:44] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[00:06:01] <coldhead> you're*
[00:09:07] <durre> Cork: thanks for the help. now it works. they had put the event.stopPropagation on the wrong element
[00:10:43] <Cork> durre: heh
[00:11:00] <Cork> durre: as long as its in the same tree hirarcy it should work
[00:13:05] <durre> Cork: it wasnt :)
[00:15:57] <eml> Ok I'm a little baffled here. I have an array containing objects with links and some names. $('<a/>').attr('href', object.href').text(object.name) is fine and dandy, but I need to create a comma separated list (commas after each link). So if I have an array of such links, how can I easily do something like array.join(', ')?
[00:16:44] <Cork> eml: you mean create loads of a links?
[00:17:29] <coldhead> the answer may be to not use jQuery
[00:17:33] <coldhead> just build the string
[00:17:34] <eml> Yep, create a bunch of links and ', ' in between each one (except the last one)
[00:17:51] <eml> Mkay, that's what I am doing now. I was just hoping for a good looking solution =)
[00:18:07] <coldhead> jQuery is great for elements, not so great with textnodes in between
[00:18:09] <Cork> eml: $.map(links, function(href) { return $('<a/>')..; }).join('');
[00:18:16] <coldhead> yeah AS IF THAT WILL WORK
[00:18:19] <coldhead> does that work?
[00:18:23] <Cork> lol
[00:18:30] <eml> :D
[00:18:50] <coldhead> you know pretty much everything worth knowing, Cork
[00:18:59] <coldhead> i hope someday i have girl trouble i can ask you about
[00:19:05] <coldhead> but that's a few years off yet
[00:19:08] <eml> I hope someday I have a girl
[00:19:12] <eml> Thanks Cork
[00:19:26] <eml> I'll be back whining when it doesn't work
[00:19:32] <eml> :)
[00:20:10] <Cork> elm: but a better option might be to use each and append it directly instead
[00:28:07] <durre> jquery, sass, compass, css3.... I might actually become tempted to go frontend afterall :)
[00:29:23] <coldhead> Dear Client, You can't expect popups to solve all your problems.
[00:29:34] <coldhead> durre: coffeescript, too!
[00:29:55] <eml> Yeah don't forget coffeescript =)
[00:30:11] <durre> coldhead: and nodejs, that might actually make backend to go frontend ;)
[00:32:25] <juha_> my coworkers didn't like the pink font in our internal tool :/
[00:33:01] <coldhead> nodejs is just an interesting diversion from moving everything to the JVM
[00:33:13] <coldhead> juha_: tell your cow orkers i hate them
[00:33:20] <juha_> just to mess with them, i left rebecca blacks lyrics on the page.. inside a <marquee>
[00:33:28] <juha_> coldhead: will do
[00:33:55] <austen> Ugh... Ok, I'm running out of options to try with IE... Resorted to injecting the html with jQuery, even THAT doesn't prevent IE from ignoring my default selections...
[00:34:28] <ndss56> whats the right jquery function to fire an event when a using presses down on a button and fire another event when user lets go of the button?
[00:34:52] <ndss56> .click() only fires when user presses and lets go of button....
[00:34:58] <juha_> "I'm trying to take screenshots but there's the lyrics coming up"
[00:35:01] <juha_> muahahhaha

[00:36:43] <coldhead> if you ask about mousemove next I KILLEE
[00:36:47] <coldhead> i don't really
[00:38:39] <austen> OH my GOD what a nightmare that was!
[00:39:06] <ndss56> coldhead: is mousemove() used to select the <option> in a menu initiated from a mousedown() which opens the menu?
[00:39:42] <coldhead> no, no it isn't
[00:39:42] <austen> srsly, about 2 hours of fiddling with internete explorer to bypass it's idiotic quirks...
[00:39:51] <coldhead> austen: you okay little buddy?
[00:39:58] <coldhead> can you get yourself a beer?
[00:40:15] <austen> coldhead: the vein in my forehead should subside soon enough...
[00:40:29] <austen> coldhead: no, can you bring me one?
[00:40:37] <austen> Or a valium?
[00:41:02] <coldhead> i don't got sorry!
[00:41:04] <coldhead> jus water
[00:41:11] <austen> Same...
[00:41:39] <austen> I have warm diet coke, but one is in the freezer and should be ready soon enough. Until then: H2O and cigarettes... speaking of which...
[00:41:50] <coldhead> well earned

[00:45:54] <juha_> you should drink those cigarettes and smoke the water, be a hipster
[00:48:27] <g0rd0n> i am using datatables and want it to get data over ajax (json format), but then i want specific columns to be formatted differently depending on what value json gives... is there a way to do this?
[00:50:02] <xec> g0rd0n: checking the values shouldnt be too hard? is it the formatting you're struggling with?
[00:50:23] <coldhead> ON THIS DAAAAAY I'VE LOSSSST FAIIIIIIIIIITH
[00:50:42] <xec> who is FAIIIIIIIIIITH?
[00:51:10] <coldhead> ahahahhaha
[00:51:11] <g0rd0n> xec:  no, checking the values... basically right now datatables displays what it gets in the rows/columns, but i dont know how to customize output... i looked at the docs but couldnt find an option
[00:51:24] <austen> coldhead: That day was Obama's inauguration for me... Regret voting for that fucker...
[00:52:23] <xec> g0rd0n: oh, i missed the part where you used some automated plugin
[00:54:51] <coldhead> yes well, i'm sure he's doing the best he can, austen
[00:54:56] <coldhead> we all are
[00:55:03] <coldhead> except dead people
[00:55:24] <eml> So I'm making a right side toolbar that follows along as the site scrolls (it positions itself to $(window).scrollTop()). The positioning makes the content of the sidebar flicker a lot, so I'm thinking I might be using the wrong approach: https://gist.github.com/1141661 <- the code is in coffeescript but it's as simple as -> means function()
[00:55:48] <coldhead> and people in comas
[00:55:48] <coldhead> SO LAZY
[00:56:27] <coldhead> thanks for the coffeescript tutorial, eml
[00:56:41] <coldhead> why aren't you just using position:fixed in CSS?
[00:56:50] <eml> Good question
[00:56:53] <coldhead> not lazy enough?
[00:57:10] <eml> Probably. Sec
[00:57:11] <eml> :p
[00:57:49] <eml> Oh yeah. I just need to reposition it when scrollTop() goes beyond a certain value. Thanks coldhead
[00:58:10] <coldhead> yay!
[01:00:19] <JKarsrud> morning #jquery :) Long time, no see :)
[01:00:52] <xec> or IS IT
[01:00:57] <coldhead> welcome home, JKarsrud
[01:01:09] <JKarsrud> thanks coldhead :)
[01:01:27] <JKarsrud> how's life?
[01:02:30] <juha_> i hate the visit
[01:03:38] <coldhead> hahaha
[01:03:41] <coldhead> the visit was awesome
[01:03:59] <coldhead> JKarsrud: i am about to ditch work for the week to go feast on pakistani food
[01:04:13] <coldhead> it could be worse
[01:04:20] <coldhead> it could still be yesterday, for instance
[01:04:23] <coldhead> or this morning
[01:04:32] <JKarsrud> heh, for sure!
[01:04:39] <juha_> or even worse, you could be on #jquery
[01:04:42] <coldhead> i shared that visit hating far and wide, thanks juha_
[01:05:35] <coldhead> sup juha_
[01:05:38] <JKarsrud> :D
[01:05:42] <juha_> this is what i was talking about, they give opsors to all kind of lunatics
[01:05:49] <JKarsrud> why you hatin' juha?
[01:05:56] <xmart2k> hello, is there an event that is triggered when an object appear in dom? I'm getting some data from ajax and I need to make some changes on that object. adding an action onscucces is not an option. thanks
[01:06:00] <coldhead> he's just a little sober, JKarsrud
[01:06:03] <coldhead> he'll get better
[01:06:13] <juha_> i hate being sober
[01:06:15] <coldhead> a few more trips to the bottle hidden in the toilets
[01:06:23] <juha_> toiletwine
[01:06:32] <coldhead> it gets me through the day!
[01:06:47] <JKarsrud> toilcila?
[01:06:58] <JKarsrud> toilquila even
[01:07:56] <coldhead> ima try ordering that next time i'm at a bar
[01:08:03] <JKarsrud> :D
[01:08:24] <juha_> you'll get the best toilquilas behind the bar, in the dark alley
[01:08:50] <JKarsrud> I'm still trying to sober up a bit from the vacation, but going totally sober just won't cut it
[01:11:53] <coldhead> sobriety is for the pope
[01:11:56] <coldhead> and even he drinks
[01:11:59] <coldhead> probably
[01:12:31] <JKarsrud> most likely
[01:14:37] <austen> Are you kidding? Haven't you seen those boozy sunken eye sockets? Christ Jesus, does the man DRINK!
[01:15:17] <coldhead> well i'm sure it helps him forget
[01:15:23] <austen> He drinks Everclear and then chases that with turpentine.
[01:16:00] <coldhead> http://wackyiraqi.com/wtf/everyone_has_aids.jpg
[01:16:41] <austen> Yeah, if it was your job to protect child molesters in Sunday-school positions, you'd probably drink too.
[01:17:22] <austen> That guy is seriously creepy...
[01:18:17] <coldhead> well he'll be dead soon
[01:18:31] <coldhead> then we'll get a hot young african pope
[01:18:38] <berserkr> hi all
[01:18:57] <coldhead> oh hi
[01:19:35] <berserkr> is possible to block de queue of fadeIn() fadeOut() functions??
[01:19:52] <berserkr> or I need to use animate instead?
[01:21:27] <Cork> berserkr: animate does the same thing
[01:21:39] <Cork> berserkr: you can stop the earlier animation though
[01:21:42] <Cork> ?.stop
[01:21:42] <bot-t1> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[01:22:36] <Cork> berserkr: or if something has ended up in the queue theres clearQueue see ?.clearQueue
[01:22:36] <bot-t1> berserkr, .clearQueue([queueName]): Remove from the queue all items that have not yet been run. http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[01:23:09] <berserkr> ohm! thank you I'll take a look
[01:26:25] <coldhead> good day, you all
[01:27:53] <ndss56> how to auto full menu on mouse down? see http://jsfiddle.net/WVeqb/
[01:29:23] <g0rd0n> xec: automated plugin? what do you mean
[01:29:54] <xec> g0rd0n: "datatables"
[01:31:42] <g0rd0n> heh :)
[01:32:51] <xec> first i thought you just meant generic html tables with data in them... ;)
[01:36:18] <ndss56> how to get menu to open up fully on mouseup()? see http://jsfiddle.net/WVeqb/1/
[01:36:25] <devians> is it possible to make multiple ajax requests simultaneously and then trigger a callback after the last one returns?
[01:37:05] <Cork> devians: not nativly, but its simple enough to wrap
[01:37:23] <devians> Cork: some pointers would be greatly appreciated
[01:38:07] <Cork> devians: stor a variable for the number of calls, create a function that you call to create the ajax request (a wrapper around .ajax)
[01:38:31] <Cork> devians: then beforey you call .ajax insert a function for complete
[01:38:40] <Cork> in that one run count--;
[01:38:48] <Cork> and when its 0 call your own callback
[01:38:57] <devians> ah yeah, thats simple enough
[01:39:13] <Cork> don't forget to check it like count < 1
[01:39:41] <Cork> its so irritating when a callback fails cause you get count -1 :)
[01:40:08] <austen> Wow... JSFiddle works just like IE: follow a link to their site and you get what you were working on previously, not what whomever posted the link wanted you to see..
[01:40:16] <austen> Sorry ndss56: I tried
[01:40:33] <Cork> austen: thats cause it uses coolies
[01:40:46] <Cork> *cookies
[01:41:26] <austen> Yeah? Still a bad design. :) Lots of sites use cookies but can still deliver the page you direct link to. :)
[01:41:42] <ndss56> austen: thanks for trying. im not sure if its even possible to fully open drop down menu on mouseup()..
[01:42:38] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/WVeqb/
[01:42:49] <austen> ndss56: is this a drop-down menu that you're animating yourself? I have similar menus (drop down and slide out) that work just fine. But I'm not using mouseup, I'm just using .click()
[01:43:37] <ndss56> austen: im happy to use .click() if that can fully open drop down menu
[01:45:06] <austen> My guess is that it doesn't have anything to do with mouseup or click. Are you animating the menu yourself or are you letting some plugin handle it? eg, are you caling $(selector).animate({bottom: +=200px}) or somethign like that?
[01:45:47] <austen> Or are you calling .slideDown()
[01:46:06] <ndss56> austen: animating myself.
[01:46:28] <ndss56> austen: tried calling .click() on select but that doesnt open up drop down menu
[01:47:07] <austen> ndss56: check your CSS. make sure the element you're animating has a width and a height set.
[01:47:47] <ndss56> austen: the drop down menu is showing but i want it to fully open up the list on mouseup()
[01:47:55] <austen> I would also check the starting position of the element, bring it to z-index: 100001010101 or something ridiculously high so you can see where it begins and ends on your page.
[01:48:14] <austen> Hmnnn...
[01:48:14] <mijaha> hi
[01:48:51] <ndss56> austen: now you get me ;) http://jsfiddle.net/WVeqb/
[01:48:53] <mijaha> how can i protect my register jquery post from multiple fake acc, if i have withoud mail confirm an captcha ?
[01:49:21] <austen> DAMN IT TO HELL!! How can I get to *sobebody else's* code in fucking jsfiddle?? This is super retarded...
[01:49:56] <xec> austen: lolwut?
[01:50:40] <ndss56> austen: im using IE. im sure why you cant see code in jsfiddle.
[01:50:46] <ndss56> *not sure
[01:51:34] <austen> Ok, deleted the damn cookies... now I can see.
[01:51:48] <austen> "select option" 1234, yeah?
[01:51:55] <ndss56> austen: eyah
[01:52:09] <austen> Works fine for me... Let me check it in IE
[01:52:21] <Toverbal> Hi guys, I have kind of an issue with the sortables (it's probably that I don't understand how it actually works). If you go to the test page of the portlets at http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/portlets.html and you horizontally move the 'shopping' portlet to the right, it will have a drop target on the bottom. If you don't release it and move it to the left again and then to the right again, its drop target is changed to the middle one.
[01:52:40] <Toverbal> question: how does the sortable decide where to drop the portlet?
[01:52:52] <ndss56> austen: dude, the menu shows but the list is fully open until you click on the menu.
[01:53:12] <ndss56> austen: i want it to happen automatically.
[01:53:19] <austen> ndss56: it's working in ie8 for me too...
[01:53:50] <ndss56> austen: dude, the menu is not fully open until you click on it.
[01:54:01] <austen> Um.. Aah... ok.
[01:54:36] <austen> I think there is an HTML option you can explicilty set in the select to show a certain # of fields...
[01:55:27] <ndss56> austen: really? what is it?
[01:56:36] <austen> I think I just pasted it into your code... But it is:  multiple="multiple" size="2"
[01:56:55] <austen> put that into your <select> and it will show all four options at once.
[01:57:22] <austen> er/ show size= number of options...
[01:59:18] <ndss56> whats the link?

[02:40:40] <willka> Hello, everyone. I've a rokkie, I don't know how to use Jquery to select the content of Title in the sentense:<img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://dev.devwht.com/sites/dev.devwht.com/files/20101131438516.jpg" alt="" title="Standard Cabin    ">

[02:42:17] <willka> I just know how to select the html from the class , but I don't know how to get part of the content
[02:42:44] <exitdescription> there's prob some kind of .data method from the html fragment you obtain
[02:43:33] <jovrtn> willka: $('img').attr('title')
[02:44:52] <willka> what I want to do is print the Title of this image from this HTML
[02:45:21] <xec> willka: jovrtn's method should do just that, show us your code if it doesnt work
[02:45:21] <exitdescription> create another fragment and set the content of it
[02:45:48] <exitdescription> it should be pretty obvious in the documentation
[02:46:06] <willka> Thanks anyway :)
[02:46:11] <willka> I will try it
[02:47:45] <willka> :)  I think it harder than create a WOW's macro
[02:48:14] <jovrtn> where are you from?
[02:48:18] <xec> heheh
[02:49:19] <willka> China, so my English is as bad as my Jquery

[03:52:06] <Deele> I dont get "modern" HTML/CSS designers, who are using HTML5 & CSS3 already... its not ready for usage...
[03:52:19] <seutje> I don't get ppl that say that
[03:52:23] <Deele> :D
[03:52:24] <seutje> Deele: using CSS 2.1?
[03:52:28] <seutje> IT'S NOT READY!!
[03:52:44] <Deele> I mean, most browsers does not support those feature
[03:52:45] <Deele> s
[03:52:57] <seutje> define "most" and define "features"
[03:53:05] <Deele> wont do that atm
[03:53:10] <Deele> just saying...
[03:53:32] <seutje> figures
[03:53:43] <Deele> its good and nifty, does the job lot faster, but still, its not reday for full-scale usage
[03:54:23] <seutje> moar vague statements, MOAR!!
[03:54:30] <Deele> even jquery has no CSS3 support...
[03:54:46] <Deele> afaik
[03:55:09] <seutje> sure it does
[03:55:48] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, no examples = you're full of it
[03:56:14] <blackspotwiggins> what makes html5 doctype "not ready for use"
[03:59:00] <Deele> blackspotwiggins, ok, it is compleated, starting from this month... did not know
[03:59:18] <seutje> ?define compleated
[03:59:27] <blackspotwiggins> wtf?
[03:59:48] <seutje> oh, u just meant completed
[03:59:53] <seutje> wait what? o.O
[03:59:56] <Deele> "as of August 2011 is still under development"
[04:00:12] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, name
[04:00:13] <seutje> still says working draft for me
[04:00:15] <blackspotwiggins> 2 reasons
[04:00:20] <blackspotwiggins> why html5 doctype is not ready for use
[04:00:22] <blackspotwiggins> for stfu
[04:00:23] <Deele> draft = not compleated
[04:00:27] <seutje> so?
[04:00:27] <Lampoon> so are you
[04:00:28] <blackspotwiggins> or*
[04:00:49] <Deele> draft = not implemented by majority of browsers
[04:00:58] <blackspotwiggins> wrong, bitch
[04:00:58] <seutje> now ur just making shit up
[04:01:09] <blackspotwiggins> it works everywhere
[04:01:15] <seutje> even if it didn't
[04:01:19] <seutje> that's not what draft means
[04:01:35] <seutje> just means "some of this shit might change, be weary!"
[04:01:47] <astropirate> Deele, People like you are why the world is so crewed up!
[04:02:28] <Deele> astropirate, thanks, but still, comparing one people you do not know to "people" you dont know either, is little bit dumb...
[04:02:45] <astropirate> Deele, lol i kid i kid
[04:03:00] <seutje> I think that sentence just gave me an aneurism o.o
[04:03:28] <Deele> I'm sorry, if you can't understand my english...
[04:03:33] <seutje> Deele: btw, I'm using CSS3 animations where supported in this lil plugin I'm writing
[04:03:39] <seutje> I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings
[04:03:57] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, im using html5 and css3 everywhere. just to spite backwarded people like you
[04:04:16] <Deele> I initiated dicussion, looks like noone needs that, just throwing axes in my face, i did not said that you can't or you should not, I just dont think, it is reliable to work with "technology in draft"...
[04:05:04] <blackspotwiggins> you probably are one of those people who says gravity is just a "theory"
[04:05:16] <blackspotwiggins> without understanding what the word means
[04:05:39] <Deele> I'm sorry, if you cant communicate with people in internet, you are only interested in flaming about my personality, that you dont even know...
[04:06:05] <astropirate> so
[04:06:09] <astropirate> who wants to talk some jquery?
[04:06:12] <seutje> throwing a condescending comment in an unrelated chatroom full people u just addressed in quotes is hardly initiating a discussion
[04:06:24] <seutje> especially when u completely refuse to present any arguments
[04:06:49] <seutje> they have a word for that on the intertubes...
[04:06:53] <seutje> just saying...
[04:07:22] <Deele> no use to argue with you... you completely refuse to understand, what I'm saying...
[04:07:23] <sean`> astropirate, COME ON BABY
[04:07:34] <sean`> hi seutje
[04:07:49] <seutje> OHAI sean`
[04:08:27] <astropirate> Any linux people here?  How does your JavaScript development environment look like?
[04:08:36] <seutje> slick
[04:08:38] <seutje> :P
[04:09:03] <seutje> giving netbeans another shot, but it really blows at JS
[04:09:13] <seutje> and css for that matter
[04:09:17] <blackspotwiggins> like anything with java, it runs superslow
[04:09:23] <twoface> vim is fine for js :)
[04:09:26] <blackspotwiggins> im using sublime text2 for now
[04:09:31] <seutje> yea, but compared to eclipse, it's lightning fast :P
[04:09:40] <astropirate> i tried vim for javascript it was a disaster
[04:09:48] <seutje> might give cloud9IDE another go
[04:09:54] <nail_> sometimes when I close netbeans I can hear my memory screaming "freeeeeeeeeedooooooooommmmmmmmmm" if there's no noise in the room
[04:09:55] <Cork> gedit is farly nice if your running gnome
[04:09:55] <seutje> or just go back to gedit
[04:10:05] <astropirate> nail_, lol
[04:10:19] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:10:21] <seutje> thing I don't like about gedit is the vast amount of outdated and useless plugins out there
[04:10:30] <astropirate> i thik i found the perfect setup  i hope this doesn't come accross as promotion
[04:10:34] <astropirate> http://mansoorsayed.com/2011/08/10/gnome3-javascript-developement-setup/
[04:11:09] <seutje> why is that a video?
[04:11:31] <astropirate> because i wanted to try ffmpeg :D
[04:11:38] <astropirate> and didn't want to write
[04:12:20] <seutje> oh, sry, I just viewed it as 5 screenshots
[04:12:44] <Cradam> i have found something some people might like for the plugin i use quite frequently
[04:14:23] <zapp> hi
[04:14:27] <zapp> quick question
[04:14:53] <Cradam> http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/CDNjQueryCycle299.ashx = great
[04:15:16] <zapp> I am using jquery-ui datepicker
[04:15:35] <zapp> I want it to always be visible so I call it in a div instead of a input box
[04:15:42] <zapp> but then how do I get the value of the date the user picks?
[04:16:23] <seutje> zapp: onSelect
[04:16:30] <zapp> I want to add a submit button so the user can select a date/time and get those values.  But I also want the calendar to always be visible
[04:16:38] <zapp> but there are multiple parts to it?
[04:16:41] <zapp> its date+time
[04:16:49] <JKarsrud> seutje: saw you mentioning IDE's up there, have you tried WebStorm?
[04:17:10] <seutje> JKarsrud: yea, that's even worse than eclipse in terms of memory consumption
[04:17:44] <JKarsrud> Hm, not my experience at all..
[04:18:37] <juha_> oh man i just updated my personal homepages
[04:18:39] <juha_> looks sweeeet
[04:18:42] <JKarsrud> but yes, it's not awesome, but I don't think I could live without it's code intelligence when working on large projects :)
[04:18:50] <JKarsrud> juha_: linkz?!
[04:19:06] <juha_> http://juha.bin.fi view in webkit <3
[04:19:35] <JKarsrud> ahhh, <3
[04:19:51] <blackspotwiggins> comic sans :D
[04:20:01] <JKarsrud> love it juha_!
[04:20:04] <juha_> best font ever
[04:20:54] <JKarsrud> I concurr
[04:47:51] <BucketHarmony> I need help.  I need to call a delay on a mouseout event before changing the CSS property of the item that calls the event.
[04:49:50] <BucketHarmony> something like jQuery(this).children('ul').delay(500).css('display', 'none');
[04:49:56] <IgnisDiabolus> BucketHarmony, $('#button').mousetout(function() { setTimeout(function() {}, 1000); });
[04:49:59] <IgnisDiabolus> aw
[04:50:00] <IgnisDiabolus> :(
[04:50:58] <BucketHarmony> Ignis, I will try to make that work
[04:51:29] <IgnisDiabolus> *mouseout
[04:51:42] <dabear> you're such a mousetout!
[04:51:48] <BucketHarmony> Can I pass $('this') as a variable to a function?
[04:52:06] <BucketHarmony> I seem to be having problems with that
[04:52:09] <IgnisDiabolus> $(this)
[04:52:56] <IgnisDiabolus> js noob here, but I think js vars are most of the time global. can you post your code?
[04:53:05] <IgnisDiabolus> in pastebin
[04:53:10] <sunscreen> I want to make a scrollable list into the dashboard of  http://stream.selectukradio.tk/shoutstats-0.8.4/  which is my best bet
[04:53:24] <durre> I have the event. how do I check what type of element was clicked? I want to check if it was a <a> element
[04:55:55] <Lochlan> event.target ?
[04:55:58] <Lochlan> or event.target.className ?
[04:56:00] <astropirate> durre,   inside of the  event handler    $(this).get(0).tagName
[04:56:57] <Lochlan> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[04:57:01] <Lochlan> bottom tutorial even does it
[04:57:30] <BucketHarmony> http://pastebin.com/v0FM5D19
[04:57:38] <BucketHarmony> Any tips on why this does not work?
[04:57:47] <BucketHarmony> It works without the delay
[04:58:18] <Cradam> BucketHarmony, jsfiddle
[04:59:16] <astropirate> BucketHarmony, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[04:59:37] <rambo3> having a problem with nth child and variable , it it posible to use variable inside string like printf %2 or php "st{var}rin" :  $("#MainContent_resultpanel > div:nth-child(" + (curr) + ")").css("display", "block"); is not working  $("#MainContent_resultpanel > div:nth-child(2)").css("display", "block");
[05:02:37] <BlaDe^> if I have <ul> ... </ul> <ul> <li> <ul> ... </ul> </li> </ul>   and I do $('ul').hide();
[05:02:55] <BlaDe^> how can I only select the outermost ul's ? or should I add a class and do a :is(.outer) ?
[05:03:26] <dabear> BlaDe^: <ul class="outer"> and $("ul.outer")
[05:03:27] <Cradam> class
[05:03:28] <IgnisDiabolus> BucketHarmony, this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/VWEYwEhB
[05:03:55] <BlaDe^> so there isn't a selector to do it?
[05:05:10] <BucketHarmony> Ignis, nope does not work
[05:05:11] <xec> BlaDe^: if you know what the containing element of the outermost ul is, you can select using that
[05:05:26] <BlaDe^> and do :first-child ?
[05:05:34] <BlaDe^> it works with classes, i'm only curious for future reference
[05:05:34] <xec> BlaDe^: like $('div > ul')
[05:05:38] <BlaDe^> ah ok - thanks :)
[05:06:24] <xec> first-child is to select the first of siblings, not filter if an element is a direct child
[05:07:22] <BlaDe^> that's what I thought
[05:08:58] <BucketHarmony> Whooo hoo I got it working
[05:09:20] <Derppy> Anyone familiar with colorbox, or some other jquery lightbox-plugins? I got a bunch of thumbnail-links to images and I want to create a slideshow out of them, but not directly from clicking the thumbnails (different behavior for that). I'd want to start the slideshow from click of a button.
[05:10:12] <rambo3> so nth-child start at 1
[05:10:15] <rambo3> solved
[05:12:36] <mazzachre> Is there a way to use the alert window from jquerymobile to show some alert of my own?
[05:13:49] <Derppy> The button isn't a child of the links. It's a "start slideshow"-button on top of the gallery. Clicking the thumbnails opens the image in fixed position, but the slideshow-button should trigger the lightbox/colorbox whatever. I just couldn't find a method to prevent it from capturing clicks and supplying a manual trigger instead.
[05:18:35] <Cradam> Derppy, i like fancybox
[05:37:07] <davidw> Is there a way to select with some kind of OR?   ".foobar || .beebop" ?
[05:37:30] <johanhar> I could need some help with the autocomplete UI widget, anyone who think they are able to help ?
[05:37:52] <ndss56> how to trigger a select menu to show all options without clicking on the select menu?
[05:37:53] <erichynds> davidw: $(".foo, .bar")
[05:38:10] <Cradam> erichynds, isnt that .foo and .bar
[05:38:33] <johanhar> I want to select the first ui.item that was in the list/widget on close. But doing a console.log(ui) on the close event, gives me nothing. Any suggestions to how I can get the data fetched in the ajax call on close?
[05:38:34] <erichynds> depends how you read it
[05:38:42] <seutje> davidw: $foo = $('.foobar'); $foo = $foo.length ? $foo : $('.beebop'); ?
[05:38:42] <nail_> davidw: what would you expect? if there are elements of the foobar class, take them and only them, and if not, take those of the beebop class?
[05:39:01] <seutje> looks fugly though
[05:39:16] <davidw> nail_, no.  Take any element that is either a .foobar or a .beebop
[05:39:22] <davidw> so I think what erichynds said
[05:39:23] <seutje> oh
[05:39:27] <seutje> then erichynds' is correct
[05:39:34] <nail_> yep, that's an and :)
[05:39:52] <davidw> nail_, mmm an and would mean that it must be both classes
[05:40:03] <seutje> davidw: were u confused with a selector that selects stuff that has both classes? like $('.foobar.beebop') ?
[05:40:04] <nail_> no, both classes would be .foo.bar
[05:40:26] <seutje> CSS doesn't work with ORs and ANDs :P
[05:40:28] <ndss56> need help guys. sample code here http://jsfiddle.net/WVeqb/4/
[05:40:47] <davidw> seutje, I was speaking 'logically'... "select all classes that are X OR Y"
[05:41:10] <erichynds> don't worry, i knew what you meant
[05:41:21] <davidw> I think erichynds is the winner in any case
[05:41:30] <seutje> emotes rly don't mean anything to people nowadays :(
[05:41:51] <seutje> ndss56: u want the select list to open?
[05:42:17] <ndss56> seutje: yes when user clicks on button.
[05:42:23] <seutje> ndss56: don't think u can
[05:42:24] <Cradam> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP12EKjRIrI
[05:42:32] <seutje> will prolly have to make a faux select
[05:42:44] <seutje> like jquery UI does, or uniform or the likes
[05:42:48] <ndss56> seutje: really? this website has it.
[05:43:08] <seutje> care to show me?
[05:43:19] <seutje> or do I guess what the URL to this website is?
[05:43:46] <ndss56> seutje: im not sure you would be bothered creating an account to see it.
[05:43:56] <seutje> nope, I wouldn't
[05:44:07] <seutje> are u sure it isn't a faux select?
[05:44:21] <ndss56> seutje: what do you mean by faux select?
[05:44:39] <seutje> a bunch of divs or a ul with LIs that just look like a select
[05:44:51] <seutje> but just propagate all clicks and stuff to the real select that's hidden
[05:45:31] <seutje> ndss56: like on http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[05:45:41] <ndss56> seutje: it think be a faux select. i really have no way of telling though
[05:45:56] <seutje> rly? just inspect it o.O
[05:46:43] <ndss56> seutje: actually yeah.... i'll give that a try.
[05:48:37] <ndss56> it would be cool if jquery could trigger select menu list to open...
[05:48:51] <ndss56> one less click by user.
[05:50:03] <erichynds> it's not an issue with jquery, its a browser limitation
[05:50:48] <seutje> yea
[05:50:50] <ndss56> erichynds: browser or html spec limitation
[05:51:05] <seutje> no point having it in the spec if no1 implements it :P
[05:51:35] <erichynds> ye, that's usually how things roll
[05:51:44] <ndss56> :D but im sure its not in the spec though.
[05:54:17] <ndss56> yeh faux menu... a ul with a bunch of li
[05:54:34] <ndss56> clever cookie you are seutje
[05:55:08] <Cherish> Hi.. all , just wondering if someone could help with something someone was trying to help me with last night.   code is http://pastebin.com/FN4v9F0s my working url is at http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride.html which is before it was recoded and the one with the problem is http://chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html.  I am basically trying to get the dressinfo div to update with the longDescription of what ever image is in the im
[05:57:37] <nawras> Hello
[06:00:04] <nawras> I'm using jquery templates with jquerymobile. It works fine when I visit a page A for the first time, but when I change to page B and come back to page A, it's like no CSS is being applied to it.
[06:00:22] <nawras> But the data in the template is updated...
[06:00:24] <ff0000_it> hi all :-)
[06:03:25] <ff0000_it> i'm trying to code a JS flash blocker, but i've a problem: to block flash content on the current document i use "beforeload" event (it should be from webkit library) and it works fine, but i can't find a way (event or somthing else) to parse IFRAMEs' DOM before they get loaded... any suggestion?
[06:07:34] <JAAulde> Is it documented anywhere that an element has the `remove` event triggered on it when jQuery is used to `.remove()` it from the DOM?
[06:18:52] <johnline3> $('#js-slideshow:nth-child(1n+2)').cycle({fx: 'fade', timeout: 5400, speed: 1000, slideResize: 0});
[06:19:31] <johnline3> hey guys, im trying to make jquery cycle rotate all images except the first one in a list with this
[06:19:35] <johnline3> but it doesnt work
[06:19:53] <johnline3> does jquery support these more complex types of nth-child?
[06:20:55] <ndss56>  <li id="x" class="d">option a</li>
[06:20:58] <ndss56>  <-- how to get the text option a?
[06:21:20] <erichynds> $("#x").text()
[06:21:36] <ndss56> erichynds: thankyou.
[06:21:53] <erichynds> you are most welcome
[06:22:55] <ndss56> erichynds: with all my heart.
[06:23:18] <TeddyMurray> with firebug, how can i see the events that are binded to the event?
[06:23:22] <TeddyMurray> actually i mean the chrome inspector
[06:23:27] <TeddyMurray> binded to an element*
[06:25:28] <ndss56> its amazing what you can learn from inspecting source code.
[06:26:46] <TeddyMurray> ?
[06:27:41] <TeddyMurray> ah ha, there is an event listeners tab in chrome
[06:27:46] <JAAulde> Is it documented anywhere that an element has the `remove` event triggered on it when jQuery is used to `.remove()` it from the DOM?
[06:33:33] <TeddyMurray> hmm, in the chrome inspector.. under event listeners.. how can i see what line and what file the jquery is being excuted?
[06:33:51] <TeddyMurray> right now its just telling me that an event exists

[06:45:42] <metamd> I'm doing this to show and hide two different elements when something's clicked: http://pastebin.com/pwspcPts
[06:45:54] <metamd> is there a way of doing it without using slideUp's callback to trigger slideDown on the other element
[06:46:03] <IAMJONNY> brugby, v8
[06:46:12] <IAMJONNY> it works in everything else other than IE
[06:46:26] <brugby> google jquery slideup ie
[06:46:27] <metamd> i.e. is there a nicer way to queue effects on different elements
[06:46:35] <brugby> im sure there is something if it's truly a systemic ie problem
[06:46:39] <Cradam> can anyone post a link to a tabbed navigation?
[06:46:45] <brugby> .queue and dequeu
[06:46:53] <brugby> jqueryui.com
[06:47:35] <IAMJONNY> brugby, i think its to do with position: relative being set to the slideDown fieldset =p ill check now
[06:47:47] <metamd> brugby: was that at me
[06:48:01] <IAMJONNY> no its not:(
[06:48:58] <brugby> yea. something like that IAMJONNY , http://forum.jquery.com/topic/internet-explorer-7-and-slideup
[06:49:25] <brugby> yes metamd , http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[06:49:43] <brugby> Cradam, same thing - http://jqueryui.com/demos/

[06:51:51] <brugby> Not sure what the issue is.
[06:51:55] <brugby> what ver of jquery are you using?
[06:52:12] <Conanbatt> Hey guys. I have a page with an iframe inside. TO do some stuff in the iframe i need information from the higher document. What is the proper way to send a message from the document to the iframe?
[06:52:12] <IAMJONNY> 1.6.4
[06:52:21] <IAMJONNY> 1.6.2
[06:52:23] <brugby> i didnt even know they were up to .4 lol
[06:52:24] <IAMJONNY> *
[06:52:25] <brugby> ok.
[06:52:25] <Conanbatt> so far, im writing a div, and reading it from the other side, which works but feels alittle hackish
[06:52:39] <krisjnt> Hello, anyone french ?
[06:52:52] <brugby> ?demo @ Conanbatt
[06:52:52] <bot-t1> Conanbatt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:53:07] <g0rd0n> k nvm i found a solution
[06:53:51] <krisjnt> Doesn't matter. Does $.ajax( /* ... */ ).responseText works with "async:true" ?
[06:54:52] <ff0000_it> is there a way to traverse an iframe DOM before it gets loaded?
[06:55:13] <krisjnt> Does $.ajax( /* ... */ ).responseText works with "async:true" ?
[06:55:48] <brugby> before?
[06:56:11] <brugby> just don't show it, traverse it, then show what you want after you've stripped out waht you need or w/e
[06:56:20] <brugby> not sure krisjnt
[06:56:27] <brugby> what you trying to do krisjnt
[06:56:41] <ff0000_it> brugby, i'd like to prevent flash loading...
[06:56:56] <krisjnt> @brugby I'm in a very strong problem...
[06:57:17] <brugby> prevent? then just strip it out via js
[06:58:15] <krisjnt> I'm trying to return the data I collected with $.ajax() asynchroniously, but apparently, I can't use responseText for that...
[06:58:43] <brugby> in the success: function (response){// do your stuff here}
[06:58:47] <IAMJONNY> brugby - do you have any suggestions mate:)?
[06:59:08] <brugby> Nope. I dont even look at IE lol
[06:59:43] <brugby> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />
[06:59:46] <brugby> in the header
[06:59:52] <ff0000_it> brugby, mmmh... say that i'm trying so i don't know what i'm doing :-P, but in the current page document i fire up an event listener ("beforeload") and remove all flash before they are displayed (and i think before they are downloaded).
[07:00:04] <krisjnt> I tried with "success", but, I really need to store the data in a variable, but the function is "private"
[07:00:08] <TeddyMurray> $('#contact2 option:selected').val() is this correct?
[07:00:13] <TeddyMurray> #contact2 is a select box
[07:01:00] <krisjnt> (Sorry for my english, I'm french)
[07:01:05] <brugby> then outside your $.ajax do a var data; then in your success: data = response
[07:01:47] <brugby> hey IAMJONNY , make sure you put var's on all your variables
[07:01:50] <brugby> IE hates NO vars
[07:02:13] <ff0000_it> brugby, i think "beforeload" event occures right after the DOM tree is built, so the browser hasn't downloaded the embedded contents yet... i'm searching if it's possible to do the same thing with IFRAMEs
[07:02:45] <brugby> IAMJONNY, also, make sure you have your jquery script loading as 'text/javascript' not 'application/javascript'
[07:03:18] <brugby> just store it do a variable. It's not LOADED into the dom until you append the data so you should be able to get around it
[07:04:03] <krisjnt> doing a var data doesn't work anymore... :s I tried to understand $.ajax with async:true, and it seems to be executed in an other "thread", so I use semaphores to protect it, but it's very hard to control it...
[07:04:03] <brugby> did you get that IAMJONNY
[07:04:21] <brugby> $.ajax is async by default
[07:04:25] <seutje> did that punk just call me a biscuit?
[07:04:37] <ff0000_it> brugby, thanks i'll try that way :-)
[07:04:38] <brugby> lol
[07:05:05] <seutje> if ajax was sync by default, my head would asplode :(
[07:06:07] <JAAulde> if it were sync by default, it would be sjax
[07:06:10] <brugby> also, IAMJONNY , overflow:hidden helps on the sliding element
[07:06:12] <JAAulde> l0lz0r
[07:06:27] <brugby> lol seutje
[07:06:43] <seutje> WAT?
[07:06:45] <brugby> and then it wouldn't be nearly as catchy sounding
[07:06:55] <JAAulde> quite true
[07:07:05] <brugby> the my head would explode quip you made :)
[07:07:28] <seutje> meh, ppl manage to pronounce PECL and HAML and stuff...
[07:08:15] <seutje> would sjax be pronounced S-jax or sajax?
[07:08:33] <brugby> True, but Ajax rolls of the tongue. And both have consonent vowel, this would be consanent consonent - not nearly as pretty rolling off the tongue
[07:08:43] <brugby> but i'm sure we would manage
[07:09:16] <krisjnt> I'm lost...
[07:09:43] <brugby> lost abotu what
[07:10:27] <krisjnt> I tried so many solution to obtain what I need, but nothing run as I want ^^
[07:10:53] <brugby> ?demo @ krisjnt
[07:10:53] <bot-t1> krisjnt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:11:08] <brugby> just throw up a fiddle or pastie and show us. it is much easier for people to help you that way
[07:11:43] <krisjnt> Okey, I go on http://jsfiddle.net
[07:12:05] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/e8SHgxww
[07:12:27] <Sean-Der> If I sent an alert at the very top of this event it works but at the bottom to alert the user of NumPhones its a no go?
[07:14:24] <krisjnt> here is a very simplified with just necessary functions of my problem : http://jsfiddle.net/fFqGF/
[07:15:39] <g0rd0n> i have a time in format HH:MM:SS however i just want to show the HH:MM so what is the best way to do so?
[07:15:40] <Brodingo> krisjnt you should be using a callback
[07:15:56] <g0rd0n> using Date()?
[07:16:01] <Brodingo> the function returns immediately while the ajax is still going
[07:16:02] <krisjnt> @Brodingo : how ? with success ?
[07:16:05] <Brodingo> yes
[07:17:00] <krisjnt> I've ever tried it, but as I say before, I need to store the content in a variable...
[07:17:14] <Brodingo> and you can do that on success
[07:17:43] <JAAulde> Is it documented anywhere that an element has the `remove` event triggered on it when jQuery is used to `.remove()` it from the DOM?
[07:20:02] <krisjnt> after modifications http://jsfiddle.net/fFqGF/3/ , it doesn't work :(
[07:20:34] <Brodingo> youre still trying to do the same thing krisjnt
[07:20:36] <Brodingo> ?ajax101
[07:20:48] <Brodingo> ?ajax101
[07:20:58] <Brodingo> ahem
[07:21:06] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[07:21:30] <krisjnt> Yes I'm always trying to do the same thing...
[07:21:43] <Brodingo> please inspect that image krisjnt
[07:22:00] <courpse> There a way to get marginLeft in % instead of px?
[07:22:16] <courpse> (Apart from doing the math, just checking first.)
[07:22:29] <Brodingo> krisjnt you need to use the success function to trigger some function or event, hence async
[07:22:33] <sean`> courpse, yes
[07:22:44] <courpse> sean`, Can you share please?
[07:22:57] <sean`> .css ('marginLeft', '50%');
[07:23:06] <courpse> I said get, not set, :/
[07:23:25] <brugby> :)
[07:23:38] <sean`> oh
[07:23:39] <sean`> well
[07:23:41] <sean`> mathboy
[07:23:58] <courpse> Right, thought so, was just checknig first thou, :)
[07:24:19] <brugby> haha
[07:24:34] <computer2000> anyone can recommend a text animation plugin?
[07:30:00] <johnline3> does jquery support these more complex types of nth-child?
[07:30:06] <johnline3> im trying to make jquery cycle rotate all images except the first one in a list with this
[07:30:12] <johnline3> but it doesnt work
[07:30:17] <jomofcw> I have created a jquery element like this $script_elements = $('<script></script>'); I want to "add" another SCRIPT element to it to append those together to another element. How to ? Add seems to work only with selectors.
[07:30:42] <johnline3> $('#js-slideshow:nth-child(1n+2)').cycle({fx: 'fade', timeout: 5400, speed: 1000, slideResize: 0});
[07:31:11] <Cradam> johnline3, you could possibly use a bit of jquery that removes the first slide from the dom
[07:32:45] <johnline3> i need to maintain it in the dom im afraid :<
[07:33:30] <Brodingo> johnline3 :not(:first)
[07:33:32] <brugby> jomofcw, just append
[07:34:19] <brugby> var s1 = $('<script></script').append($('<script></script')) etc etc
[07:34:49] <jomofcw> brugby hello ! this will append the second script in the second :/
[07:35:13] <johnline3> infact, i think this is a limitation of jquery cycle
[07:35:32] <brugby> what do you want?
[07:35:43] <AdamDV> How could I go about changing the color of text in a <textarea> as its typed? Essentially, syntax highlighting for a web-based IDE.
[07:35:54] <brugby> you want to just throw script after script into the dom?
[07:36:44] <johnline3> it wants me to select a container that holds the items of the slideshow, rather than the items themselves
[07:37:27] <brugby> google jquery syntax hilighting
[07:37:31] <Brodingo> what were you expecting johnline3?
[07:37:38] <brugby> jomofcw, ?
[07:37:41] <courpse> Humm, jquery allows +=0.2% for marginLeft, but doesn't allow -=0.2%?
[07:37:51] <brugby> lol
[07:38:39] <courpse> brugby, Is this true?
[07:39:21] <Cradam> it would have to be a pretty big site to do anything more than 1pixels of movement
[07:39:44] <brugby> yea. really big
[07:39:55] <courpse> Its doing it per pixel mouse movement.
[07:40:11] <courpse> And going forward is a good pace.
[07:40:15] <courpse> Going backwards does nothing.
[07:40:42] <johnline3> perhaps removing it isnt a bad idea Cradam
[07:40:44] <johnline3> thanks
[07:40:58] <ustunozgur> AdamDV: basically, I think you would bind an event to keydown etc.
[07:41:14] <Cradam> :)
[07:41:36] <Cradam> you just do a time delay on the remove so it doesnt remove it while it is visible
[07:41:59] <brugby> or fade it's opacity to 0, then remove
[07:42:18] <brugby> that way it's not going to get jumpy
[07:42:43] <courpse> Who you talking to?
[07:42:56] <johnline3> i was thinking it might not be difficult to write the slideshow manually, and avoid cycle on this page
[07:43:13] <courpse> Not me, darn.
[07:44:13] <brugby> dont go writing one
[07:44:18] <brugby> someone has done it, and done it better.
[07:44:21] <jomofcw> brugby my bad, it works xD.
[07:44:30] <Cradam> johnline3, you using a CDN for cycles?
[07:44:32] <brugby> don't waste your time man.
[07:44:40] <brugby> which part got it wworking jomofcw
[07:47:26] <brugby> what's another way to do a indexof without using indexof?
[07:47:42] <brugby> because I get an error in chrome with it, but I need to check a string to slice it...
[07:47:59] <dorxy> hi
[07:48:12] <dorxy> I was wondering if anyone could help me with a CSS question
[07:48:17] <jomofcw> brugby $script_elements->append()
[07:48:23] <dorxy> I have a couple of jquery UI plugins on my website
[07:48:31] <courpse> Damn it.
[07:48:36] <dorxy> but they take over part of the master page css
[07:48:43] <courpse> How can i make an image move relative of mouse position?
[07:48:43] <dorxy> like id's don't matter
[07:48:46] <brugby> um, that's a strange..php like answer
[07:49:00] <brugby> take over ? what do you mean?
[07:49:06] <brugby> ?demo @ dorxy
[07:49:07] <bot-t> dorxy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:49:32] <johnline3> didnt know there was one Cradam
[07:50:05] <Cradam> i found it today
[07:50:13] <Cradam> switching all my sites over to it
[07:50:15] <Cradam> http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/CDNjQueryCycle299.ashx
[07:50:27] <johnline3> is this the full or lite
[07:50:37] <dorxy> I'll make a screenshot
[07:50:39] <johnline3> oh nvm
[07:52:00] <Nacho> If in have $("select").find("option:first-child").remove() what do i add to end of remove to go back to the selects and then do .change()?
[07:52:26] <dorxy> imgpaste.com/LVjA.tiff is what it looks like (my tables look like that) yet this is what it should look like: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[07:52:42] <dorxy> I don't know if jquery does smt to cancel out part of that css
[07:54:31] <Cradam> its all the versions, i went for the minified full version
[07:54:50] <johnline3> nice
[07:55:19] <johnline3> i done the remove trick, sadly cycle doesnt update and i get a blank slide
[07:55:24] <muzone> At http://www.theoutnet.com/product/233196 - can somebody help me get the URL for the zoomed image?
[07:55:27] <Cradam> ahh...
[07:56:28] <muzone> I'm trying to use Firebug, but the zoom disappears before I can select inspect and hover my cursor over it.
[07:57:00] <johnline3>  slideExpr:     null,  // expression for selecting slides (if something other than all children is required)
[07:57:01] <johnline3> hmm
[07:57:08] <johnline3> maybe this is what im looking for
[08:05:51] <dorxy> brugby: do you know what it could be?
[08:06:44] <Cradam> muzone, you dont need to click it
[08:07:24] <Cradam> just navigate to where it appears in the file and wait for it to change
[08:12:44] <johnline3> http://jsbin.com/iledo3/3
[08:12:56] <johnline3> p awesome, just need to remove randomisation
[08:17:12] <wackywabbit> Can someone take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/pxkCF/
[08:17:40] <wackywabbit> I want it so each of those DIVs hide or show when the TD is clicked
[08:21:12] <ruben-> Are there known problems when selecting an element by id with e '%' in the name?
[08:22:01] <vargadanis> hi everyone!
[08:22:22] <wackywabbit> hello
[08:24:01] <vargadanis> isn't there some JS or rather JQuery method to do PHP like str_replace? meaning: I have 2 character arrays 1 for search, 1 for replace and do something like: string.replace(search_array, replace_array); where search_array is something like: search_array = ['',''] and replace_array is something like: replace_array =  ['a', 'e']
[08:24:48] <seutje> wackywabbit: u don't have to include anything outside the body tag
[08:25:28] <brugby> alright, back
[08:25:45] <wackywabbit> seutje: What do you mean? My jQuery code?
[08:25:56] <seutje> wackywabbit: #stu_info isn't a child of any div
[08:26:18] <seutje> wackywabbit: nah, the html
[08:26:49] <Xeon06_> Is there an equivalent to serialize but for normal objects?
[08:27:12] <wackywabbit> seutje: So I don't need the other tags, other than BODY, is that what you mean?
[08:27:27] <seutje> don't even need body, just the contents
[08:27:56] <wackywabbit> seutje: k
[08:28:27] <seutje> wackywabbit: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/pxkCF/1/
[08:28:35] <seutje> that's what u were gunning for, right?
[08:29:06] <wackywabbit> seutje: perfect, thanks
[08:29:16] <seutje> actually, lemme optimize it a bit
[08:29:36] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[08:29:55] <Shwaiil> Q: How to select something by "name" ? I remember something like Form[name] ehhh :P Thanks for looking
[08:30:18] <jonkri> i have this horizontal div that i want to scroll horizontally using up and down scroll events. however, when i look at the jquery scroll event functions, it seems that they are actually only triggered when the element is actually scrolled up and down. my element cannot be scrolled up or down, nor do i want it. does anyone have any ideas of what i can do instead? thanks :)
[08:30:24] <wackywabbit> seutje: I added toggle... you have a better optimization?
[08:30:49] <Xenefungus> Shwaiil: using id is preferred
[08:31:28] <seutje> wackywabbit: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/pxkCF/3/
[08:31:44] <seutje> if u would want to use toggle, u need to check the actual target
[08:32:00] <seutje> coz if ppl click the e-mail address, they're also clicking within that TD, so the toggle will fire...
[08:32:59] <brugby> hey, how do I head say 500 lines to another file in shell?
[08:34:13] <Shwaiil> Xenefungus, thanks ;)
[08:34:20] <seutje> holy ass why is fiddle so slow today
[08:34:35] <seutje> wackywabbit: like that: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/pxkCF/5/
[08:35:51] <wackywabbit> seutje: ahhh, perfect! Thatnks a bunch seutje
[08:37:48] <seutje> np, peace
[08:45:52] <jonkri> how would you catch scrolling events? (the jquery scroll() function doesn't generate an event an event if the element is not actually scrolled)
[08:47:48] <Sean-Der> Can someone please look at my jQuery for some reason my submit works in every browser but IE. I am doing things incorrectly that FireFox and others are accounting for?
[08:47:48] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/DWWZnGUh
[08:50:04] <Sean-Der> Does any one have an example of a submit done correctly?
[08:52:58] <Brodingo> Sean-Der youre missing some code in that paste
[08:53:46] <Sean-Der> Brodingo: I guess my big question is $("form").submit(function() the correct way to do a submit?
[08:54:02] <Brodingo> yes
[08:54:27] <Brodingo> should use one var statement per function though
[08:54:34] <sshaginyan> Can someone please why my jquery validation library doesn't work in ie 8, 7
[08:54:36] <sshaginyan> please
[08:54:36] <Brodingo> set all your vars at the top
[08:54:49] <sshaginyan> http://expressnationwide.com/
[08:54:57] <sshaginyan> the form at the top right
[08:55:51] <sshaginyan> Is it not suppose to work?
[08:56:10] <sshaginyan> I didn't read anything in the validation lib
[08:56:53] <Sean-Der> Ok I will do that
[08:57:23] <Brodingo> sshaginyan your whitespace is super fucked and hard to look at
[08:57:44] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: Sprry I didn't write the code let me try to fix it
[08:57:49] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: Sorry again
[08:57:58] <Brodingo> trailing comma in txtCityFrom
[08:58:07] <Brodingo> fix that, might work
[08:59:38] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: Do you mean after defaultInvalid:true(,)?
[08:59:56] <Brodingo> yeah
[09:00:06] <sshaginyan> okay let me try
[09:00:27] <Sean-Der> <input type="submit" value="Submit Quote" /> Even with my js commented out its a no go seems to be an issue with my HTML?
[09:00:45] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: please I've been at this for a day now. Let me try
[09:01:12] <Brodingo> Sean-Der working demo besides the pastebin?
[09:01:53] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: Nope didn't work
[09:02:02] <sshaginyan> Sean-Der: let me try yours
[09:02:31] <CainV> Hi
[09:02:44] <Sean-Der> I don't have a public demo atm my dev machine is behind a NAT
[09:02:54] <sshaginyan> Sean-Der: Sorry thought you where talking to me
[09:03:15] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: I tried in ie 8 with no luck
[09:03:36] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: cleaning code
[09:04:08] <CainV> anyone around minds telling me how can i refrence the object that issued a .get in it's response?
[09:05:46] <Sean-Der> HAHAH I figured it out!
[09:05:56] <Sean-Der> My <form> tags were malformed
[09:08:10] <thm> maybe that's OT, but does someone know how to implement elements that, when you scroll the page, first move up, until they reach the browser's edge and then stay there? (googlemail's button bar for example)
[09:09:14] <Shwaiil> Q: Assuming I've got $('select').live({ change : function(){} }) , on <select><option></option></value>. How to get option value ? Thanks!
[09:09:40] <sshaginyan> Brodingo: Okay it's clean
[09:09:54] <sshaginyan> Can someone please why my jquery validation library doesn't work in ie 8, 7
[09:09:59] <sshaginyan> please
[09:10:12] <sshaginyan> http://expressnationwide.com/ it's the top right form
[09:11:03] <brugby> Shwaiil, when you select something, an attrr is added to that option
[09:11:27] <Shwaiil> brugby, tks for looking.
[09:11:36] <Shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/eQQNR/9/
[09:11:45] <brugby> $("select option:selected").each(function () {
[09:11:55] <Shwaiil> brugby, I'll try that :)
[09:12:30] <Shwaiil> I remember doing this in the paste, with .live and change event
[09:12:34] <Shwaiil> worked in all browsers
[09:12:38] <brugby> so inside your change you could do a $(this).find(':selected') i believe
[09:13:27] <Shwaiil> hum nice
[09:13:29] <Shwaiil> i'll try
[09:13:54] <brugby> http://jsfiddle.net/eQQNR/11/
[09:13:56] <brugby> check that
[09:14:15] <Shwaiil> thanks a lot for your time
[09:14:22] <Shwaiil> I'm reading it right now
[09:14:34] <brugby> and you dont need to surround that e with a $() in your consolel.log
[09:14:45] <brugby> you should just be able to do console.log('my event:',e)
[09:15:00] <brugby> or console.log('my event:',e.val())
[09:15:09] <brugby> anyone elese?
[09:19:14] <jonkri> is there some way i can remove the jquery ui dialog title bar completely and only display the close button?
[09:21:18] <brugby> sure.
[09:21:29] <brugby> look for the css class and remove
[09:22:48] <brugby> $(".ui-dialog-titlebar").hide();
[09:23:03] <brugby> that should do the trick. The title bar will still render and be on the dom, but it wont display.
[09:24:10] <sehh> hey people
[09:24:43] <sehh> q: since jQuery.support can't detect HTML5 support, is there another way to do this?
[09:25:59] <erichynds> you detect individual features of html5, not the standard itself
[09:27:41] <sehh> thats the problem with jQuery.support, it doesn't have EVERY feature that I may need
[09:27:56] <sehh> for example, how can it test for the support of the <nav> tag?
[09:28:26] <sehh> so I need a general HTML5 support, than just every individual HTML5 feature
[09:28:38] <erichynds> bro
[09:28:41] <erichynds> take a step back
[09:28:45] <sehh> ok
[09:28:56] <erichynds> you want modernizr
[09:29:00] <erichynds> not jquery
[09:29:21] <erichynds> $.support detects stuff that jquery needs to operate internally with cross browser support and shit
[09:29:39] <sehh> ah so its not for us to use
[09:29:54] <sehh> rather useless function then
[09:30:12] <JAAulde> lol
[09:30:18] <erichynds> sigh
[09:30:36] <Bower^> Hey. I've just started learning javascript and I've come across jquery. I was hoping to use it to make requests for XML documents through REST APIs but I've just learn about the "same origin policy". Does this mean that I can't make requests to these web APIs when the user requests it? :/
[09:30:41] <Bower^> Or have I misunderstood it?
[09:30:46] <jeffsmykil> does offset use pixels or is it unitless?
[09:31:24] <donburks> jeffsmykil: http://api.jquery.com/offset
[09:31:34] <JAAulde> Is it documented anywhere that an element has the `remove` event triggered on it when jQuery is used to `.remove()` it from the DOM?
[09:32:02] <jeffsmykil> yeah im skimming through it now
[09:32:04] <jeffsmykil> or when you pasted it
[09:32:05] <donburks> JAAulde: There is a built-in JS event when DOM elements are removed.
[09:32:10] <jeffsmykil> just wanted the quick answer ;)
[09:32:13] <JAAulde> donburks: orly?
[09:32:19] <donburks> JAAulde: Yup.
[09:32:27] <donburks> You can bind to that event.
[09:32:46] <donburks> jeffsmykil: URL's quicker to type than the question. :P
[09:32:55] <JAAulde> donburks: that would be the entv I see triggered when bound (via jQuery) to 'remove' on an element, and then that elments gets .remove()'ed?
[09:32:59] <jeffsmykil> all that reading donburks ;)
[09:33:07] <donburks> jeffsmykil: Tsk?
[09:34:04] <donburks> JAAulde: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Events#Mutation_DOM_events
[09:34:11] <donburks> JAAulde: You want DomNodeRemove
[09:34:12] <donburks> +d
[09:34:29] <dabear> JAAulde: are you using jquery ui? it extends .remove in jquery so that a remove event is triggered when an element is .removed
[09:34:59] <JAAulde> dabear: ahhh, that must be it.  Yes, we have UI loaded and we see 'remove' get triggered when a DOM node is .removed()'ed
[09:35:09] <JAAulde> dabear: so we were trying to find docs on it
[09:35:48] <JAAulde> donburks: thanks for that info--very helpful actually. not quite my question though...see my response to dabear
[09:36:22] <donburks> Ahhhh, didn't realize you were in jqueryui.
[09:36:48] <JAAulde> donburks: heh, I didn't mention it because I had no idea it was related
[09:37:36] <JAAulde> donburks, dabear: is it document in the UI docs anywhere?  Is it something we should rely on or is it subject to change?
[09:37:49] <dabear> JAAulde: they use it internally
[09:38:06] <donburks> JAAulde: The DOMNodeRemoved event is always there, library-agnostic.
[09:38:18] <JAAulde> dabear: sure, just trying to determine how stable it is
[09:38:22] <JAAulde> donburks: true...
[09:42:54] <dabear> JAAulde: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js
[09:43:03] <dabear> it overwrites $.cleanData
[09:43:21] <dabear> and triggers remove events
[09:43:24] <JAAulde> dabear: yes, I found it in the code we're using (ui 1.8.9) thanks!
[09:43:42] <JAAulde> dabear: I guess we'll bind to it...and hope they don't remove it in the future
[09:43:46] <JAAulde> :D
[09:47:16] <brugby> sup dabear
[09:52:30] <dabear> brugby: nuthin
[09:53:11] <brugby> awesome :)
[09:55:04] <wesbos> Bower^ did you get it figured out
[09:55:34] <ShaunR> anybody have any recommendations for good horizontal drop down menu's that have nice jquery effects?  I was using superfish, looking for alternatives.
[09:56:36] <brugby> horizontal?
[09:56:46] <Bower^> wesbos, nah I'm still stuck man. I don't think what I wanna do is possible
[09:56:52] <Bower^> :(
[09:56:53] <wesbos> ShaunR jQuery UI has one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/demos/menu
[09:57:10] <wesbos> Bower^ what exactly are you trying to do? Request XML from another domain?
[09:58:09] <nym> hey, what's the correct syntax to get all "a" elements that are within the dom tree of $(selecta); ?
[09:58:27] <datlap> To delete an object I inherit from DeleteView which has 3 steps (user clicks on delete, goes to confirm page, click yes again, redirected to success page) How can I make it more inline (user clicks delete, the object is gone, user is still on the same page)
[09:58:59] <b1lly> is there a way to create an array with unique values? for example if you try to set a value inside an array that already exists, it skips it
[09:59:08] <Bower^> wesbos, I want to call the last.fm API when the user clicks some panel (triggers a call to collect the respective data and display it). At the moment I'm making all the requests in one go with PHP. It's 10+ calls so it's slow as hell
[09:59:21] <wesbos> nym: $(selecta).find('a') i believe is what you want
[09:59:39] <nym> yes, thank you!
[09:59:57] <wesbos> Bower^ you need JSONP, wich is allowed cross domain
[10:00:00] <nym> wesbos: ++
[10:00:20] <Bower^> Ah wesbos I love you man, thanks. I thought this wasn't possible
[10:00:30] <Bower^> I'll check it out
[10:01:06] <wesbos> Bower^ Im not sure if they offer JSONP, but most APIs do, good luck :)
[10:02:36] <enjoycrf> hi
[10:03:22] <wesbos> Bower^ This will give you jsonp http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=chart.gethypedartists&api_key=b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026&format=json&callback=wat
[10:03:37] <wesbos> Bower^ just specify the params &format=json&callback=wat
[10:03:53] <Bower^> Much appreciated, thanks again :)
[10:04:33] <wesbos> Bower^ np
[10:06:25] <enjoycrf> hi
[10:06:28] <wesbos> heyo
[10:06:44] <enjoycrf> yesterday i was like
[10:06:48] <Arch_> Is it possible to get the text from a .js file using jquery without it running the js file? I have a URL and essentially just want to $.get it and get the content of the file. It is running it automatically though which is not good
[10:07:01] <enjoycrf> putting a function(){} as a param
[10:07:11] <enjoycrf> and was trying to do eval on it
[10:07:13] <enjoycrf> haha
[10:07:18] <dabear> Arch_: use .ajax with datatype as text
[10:07:28] <dianeinflorida> morning all How do I assign a buttonw to show or hiude based on a text value?
[10:07:39] <Arch_> dabear: Let me try that...
[10:07:46] <enjoycrf> then i figured out that its callback"()";
[10:07:51] <enjoycrf> just like in php
[10:08:38] <dianeinflorida> Sorry I am new to chat
[10:09:29] <wesbos> dianeinflorida $('button[value=yourtext]').hide()
[10:10:16] <dianeinflorida> thank you!!

[10:18:13] <ClashCityKing> are there any good best practice guides for jQuery Mobile use?
[10:33:29] <etcetera> anyone know how jquery handles css3 grid layout?
[10:33:30] <etcetera> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/
[10:34:27] <Flam9> Why would it be any different than any other types of CSS?
[10:35:13] <etcetera> heh, nevermind, no current browser version supports it :-)

[11:12:09] <Eviltwin> Okay, fun question
[11:12:21] <Eviltwin> I'm trying to write a debugging tool
[11:12:36] <brugby> you get it working
[11:12:37] <brugby> ?
[11:13:01] <hichs> ajpiano :
[11:13:01] <Eviltwin> I would like to capture all events that pass through jQuery
[11:13:05] <Eviltwin> How do you suggest I do it?
[11:13:35] <BaconJuice> brugby: me?
[11:13:38] <BaconJuice> no I didn't
[11:13:38] <brugby> yea BaconJuice
[11:13:44] <brugby> all events?
[11:13:49] <brugby> would you really want to do that ?
[11:13:55] <dabear> Eviltwin: overwrite .bind
[11:14:00] <dabear> or .trigger
[11:14:22] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net
[11:15:14] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/Ebj2t/
[11:15:18] <BaconJuice> sorry
[11:15:20] <sshaginyan> LOL found a bug in jquery.validate.js ..............
[11:15:26] <BaconJuice> in a lecture
[11:15:33] <sshaginyan> it works :) thanks everyone
[11:15:44] <BaconJuice> sshaginyan: your welcome now help me =)
[11:15:54] <sshaginyan> sure
[11:15:57] <sshaginyan> let me see
[11:16:21] <BaconJuice> the UI breaks when I use .append()
[11:17:23] <brugby> do you mean to use jquery mobile BaconJuice ?
[11:17:34] <BaconJuice> yes I am using it
[11:17:36] <Eviltwin> dabear: I'm thinking it might be better to overwrite jQuery.Event
[11:17:39] <BaconJuice> the site is jqm powered
[11:17:44] <Eviltwin> Because if I do var x = $("#x")
[11:17:50] <Eviltwin> It's trigger wouldn't be overwritten
[11:17:53] <Eviltwin> Its*
[11:18:11] <dabear> it will
[11:18:13] <dianeinflorida> I am going a little nutty trying to figure out something if I use this $('Grade[value=fifth]').hide() what should my html look like on JQM
[11:18:15] <Eviltwin> If I enabled this code after
[11:18:20] <tauame> Hi, is there a way to show a tab as active, without showing its content?
[11:18:29] <dabear> if you overwrite $.fn.trigger..
[11:18:52] <dabear> tauame: show it, then .hide() its contents
[11:19:41] <tauame> hmm, ok, thankyou... Ill take a look
[11:20:15] <sshaginyan> BaconJuice: Tell me what happens exactly. So everything is blank or the anchors append incorrectly?
[11:20:37] <BaconJuice> everything works fine
[11:21:31] <BaconJuice> hang on
[11:21:33] <BaconJuice> sshaginyan:
[11:21:44] <sshaginyan> BaconJuice: Can I see the website?
[11:21:53] <BaconJuice> there is no html in the source code in the html
[11:22:28] <BaconJuice> <div data-role="controlgroup" data-type="horizontal" align="center" id="showromeday"></div>
[11:22:33] <BaconJuice> there is not output
[11:22:50] <thefalling> why cant i do this? $("#shipCellBEDF01").easyTooltip({useElement: "displayShipBEDF01" + $(this).attr('id').substring(8)});
[11:23:14] <thefalling> if i put the actual id in there instead of $(this).attr('id').substring(8) it works fine
[11:23:33] <BaconJuice> this is taken directly from html browser output
[11:23:36] <sshaginyan> BaconJuice: Can I see the website?
[11:23:49] <BaconJuice> sshaginyan local host =S
[11:24:10] <sshaginyan> BaconJuice: Can you copy all the html and put it in paste.org
[11:24:15] <sshaginyan> pastie.org
[11:24:20] <BaconJuice> sure
[11:24:27] <BaconJuice> but the problem is in the js file
[11:24:27] <sshaginyan> BaconJuice: html + javascript
[11:24:34] <BaconJuice> okay
[11:24:39] <BaconJuice> I will be back in 30 mins

[11:34:27] <DreamPhreak> like say div #id contains text 123, in a huge list of items. i need it to copy the 123 from the div with the #id and show it in a different section of the page. :)
[11:34:55] <Brodingo> ?text

[11:35:33] <DreamPhreak> sweet! thanks
[11:38:11] <saulo> How can I get the <img> tag number 2 in a document? I'm was trying $("#MyDiv").find(img).get(2), but isn't working
[11:38:23] <Xenefungus> ajpiano: yes it is inserted there. is that wrong?
[11:38:26] <Brodingo> ?eq @ saulo
[11:38:26] <bot-t1> saulo, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[11:38:31] <Xenefungus> donburks: no there isn't
[11:38:52] <donburks> A billion years later.
[11:39:08] <Brodingo> saulo .get() and [0] are for html, .eq() is for jquery objects
[11:39:09] <Xenefungus> yeah sorry, was having supper^^
[11:40:11] <saulo> Brodingo: Thanks! But .eq works with .find? My div have some other elements
[11:40:14] <donburks> saulo: Also remember that the arrays are 0-based, not 1-based.
[11:40:41] <Brodingo> $("#MyDiv").find(img).eq(1)
[11:40:45] <Brodingo> its zero indexed
[11:40:49] <saulo> donburks: good remember!
[11:41:05] <saulo> Brodingo, donburks: Thanks for help!
[11:46:15] <pilgrim> $potentialPlaceholders.get(0).selectedIndex returns 0 but  $potentialPlaceholders.children('option:selected').length returns 0 too, what's up? Is this a jquery bug?
[11:47:09] <saulo> What jQuery function is compatible with IE7 and Safari for .next() ?
[11:47:55] <saulo> pilgrim with children you need use .size(), i think....
[11:48:38] <Brodingo> no, length is fine
[11:49:37] <Brodingo> ?eq @ pilgrim
[11:49:37] <bot-t1> pilgrim, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[11:52:26] <Xenefungus> anyone has an idea why i cant select .activetopic outside the get? http://pastie.org/2362231
[11:58:02] <dnyy> i have an if case in a form submit, and if it fails (and the alert happens), i can't submit again after clicking okay. is this normal and how can i get around it? http://pastie.org/2362552
[11:59:57] <Brodingo> Xenefungus if its not there yet, how can you select it?
[12:00:16] <donburks> Xenefungus: Does the $.get() fire successfully?
[12:03:23] <Xenefungus> donburks: yes it does, you can have a look at it here: http://qwertz.iriscouch.com/ba/_design/barebone/index.html#
[12:03:40] <Xenefungus> the "more stuff!" gets inserted as it should, the "cool stuff" doesnt
[12:03:58] <Xenefungus> feel free to tell me if my approach is wrong, im just starting to dig into jquery
[12:05:23] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: well its created first and then selected, isnt it?
[12:05:49] <Brodingo> ?ajax101
[12:06:14] <Xenefungus> ?
[12:06:17] <Brodingo> godamnit bot
[12:06:47] <Brodingo> that executes before the ajax finishes because its asynchronous
[12:07:24] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: oh, i see. what would be the right way to do it, do i have to do all manipulation inside the get()?
[12:07:46] <Brodingo> in the success function, yes
[12:07:52] <thefalling> why cant i do this? $("#shipCellBEDF01").easyTooltip({useElement: "displayShipBEDF01" + $(this).attr('id').substring(8)});
[12:07:55] <thefalling> if i put the actual id in there instead of $(this).attr('id').substring(8) it works fine
[12:08:40] <Brodingo> wrap it in an anon function thefalling
[12:08:55] <dabear> depends what $(this) is?
[12:09:07] <dabear> it would not be the same as $("#shipCellBEDF01")
[12:09:10] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: thefalling?
[12:09:14] <dabear> which probably is where your error is
[12:09:41] <thefalling> yeah ill try doin that
[12:10:12] <KWhat_Work> why the fuck does var item = $('div').attr('id', 'fucking_js'); fuck up all the god damn css on my fucking site?  Just that line nothing else, not append no selectors
[12:10:32] <dnyy> anyone have any ideas about my problem posted earlier? :(
[12:11:08] <dnyy> the actual code: http://pastie.org/2362623
[12:11:17] <Brodingo> KWhat_Work that sets all the divs on your page to have the same id
[12:11:49] <Brodingo> KWhat_Work if you want to create a div, $('<div>')
[12:11:57] <KWhat_Work> ohhh woops forgot that <> thansk Brodingo
[12:12:02] <KWhat_Work> its been a long long week
[12:12:07] <Brodingo> i mean if you fucking want to fucking create a fucking div
[12:12:08] <blindMoe> if I am using ajax to read a json strong from the server do I need to set the content-type to 'application/json' in the header of the response?
[12:12:20] <KWhat_Work> Brodingo++
[12:15:50] <Brodingo> dnyy form in quotes?
[12:16:09] <Brodingo> or is form a var?
[12:16:34] <dnyy> Brodingo: oh, it's a var passed in to the function
[12:16:51] <Brodingo> what problem are you having?
[12:17:02] <dnyy> i got it working, though, by doing $('form input[type=submit']).click instead of submit
[12:17:16] <dnyy> it wasn't letting me submit the form again after the alert came up
[12:17:26] <Brodingo> hmmmm, thats not really good practice
[12:17:40] <dnyy> yeah, but it isn't working otherwise
[12:17:49] <Brodingo> :/
[12:18:02] <dnyy> not sure why, and google doesn't show any reasons ;-;
[12:19:39] <webdeveloperneed> so no one want to earn money by making me a website?
[12:22:17] <Bower^> webdeveloperneed, might be worth checking out some developer sites like rent a coder (think its name has changed now)
[12:23:34] <Bower^> I really wouldn't expect the service you'd get from a professional company though. I'm sure there's exceptions but they're just that, exceptions.
[12:23:55] <blindMoe> if an ajax call errors out and the error callback is called, can I access the content sent back from the server  ( like 'data' in 'success' )
[12:24:41] <djQuery> blindMoe: did you happen to look atthe documentation? see ?.ajax
[12:24:41] <bot-t> blindMoe, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:25:28] <blindMoe> djQuery: yeah I did... it returns jqXHR, textStatus and errorThrown
[12:25:44] <djQuery> well then thats the stuff u can access
[12:25:44] <blindMoe> I did an alert on each of them and non of them contained the content
[12:26:18] <djQuery> well why not learn to realy debug something and do a console.log instead?
[12:26:30] <djQuery> blindMoe: see ?ftjq
[12:26:31] <bot-t> blindMoe, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:29:03] <mistermocha> help! Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I wrote a script using a couple jquery calls and can't seem to get them to run. I know the page actually does load the script because I dropped in an alert message just to see if it runs, and it did...
[12:29:18] <mistermocha> http://swan.bdweber.net/cgi-bin/story.cgi (for those looking, look at chapterLoader.js)
[12:29:51] <rcacua> s
[12:30:11] <mistermocha> I'm really trying to get the ajax json piece to work, but I'm not sure what could be failing, which is why I started with just the simple html add-in
[12:30:21] <rcacua> help, send focus an element and run keyup..??
[12:31:32] <rcacua> to send the focus to an item that runs the keyup
[12:38:36] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: how would i check if the get() has finished?
[12:39:17] <Brodingo> you can trigger an event in the success function
[12:39:34] <pathauto> Anyone have a minute or two to help me work through jquery toggle issue?
[12:40:01] <djQuery> ?ask@pathauto
[12:40:01] <bot-t> pathauto, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:40:07] <djQuery> ?demo@pathauto
[12:40:07] <bot-t> pathauto, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:40:10] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: how exactly? i tried to bind an ajex.success function ut that didnt work
[12:40:37] <djQuery> ?get@xenefungus
[12:40:38] <bot-t> xenefungus, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

[12:40:42] <pathauto> ok one sec
[12:41:09] <djQuery> get('url', function(){ /* I fire when get is done */})
[12:41:31] <Xenefungus> djinni: yeah thats how i have it already, see my code
[12:41:44] <pathauto> Ok, so here is the page. http://www.mdsol.com/conferences/mug/amug-venue-agenda.html
[12:41:45] <Xenefungus> but i want to change the content later as well
[12:41:49] <Xenefungus> is that not possible?
[12:42:18] <pathauto> I've used Soh Tanak's tuts to build a tabbed agenda with toggle links
[12:42:25] <pathauto> Tanaka, even
[12:42:49] <Brodingo> Xenefungus its unreliable if youre adding elements asynchronously
[12:43:07] <Brodingo> learn to love the callback
[12:43:18] <djQuery> pathauto: see ?.stop
[12:43:18] <bot-t> pathauto, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[12:44:22] <Brodingo> Dr. Ajax or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Use the Success Function
[12:44:35] <pathauto> The powers that be want me to add simple open/close buttons to make it more obvious but I'm having a figuring out how to toggle the two.
[12:45:05] <pathauto> Everything works perfectly as is. I just need to be able to incorporate a toggle for some small open/close icons
[12:45:19] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: ok, perhaps i'm trying it the wrong way, let me explain: what i want to do is an app that is to run on a wall display with no interactivity. i have several items and want to change between them in certain intervals. to achieve that, i want to set the activetopic class to whichever is active right now.
[12:45:32] <Xenefungus> is my way fundamentally wrong, would you do that in another way?
[12:45:41] <pathauto> into the original toggle script
[12:46:08] <djQuery> pathauto: so add an icon at the start of the description of each event and toggle it when they click on it?
[12:46:37] <pathauto> egg-zactly. Like this: http://theodin.co.uk/blog/development/jquery-image-toggle-script-tutorial.html
[12:47:08] <Xenefungus> i tried to use a while(true) in my success function but then the get() it is called in never finishes and the site is never loaded at all
[12:47:21] <Brodingo> never
[12:47:22] <Brodingo> ever
[12:47:26] <Brodingo> ever
[12:47:30] <Brodingo> use while(true)
[12:47:38] <Xenefungus> oh, not?
[12:48:04] <Xenefungus> but i want it to run continously, is there another way to do that?
[12:48:14] <Brodingo> setTimeout
[12:48:19] <djQuery> <span class="event colapsed"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-carat-1-s"></span>Metting info</span>
[12:48:27] <t4nkd> How can I .trigger('click') but not until N seconds have passed
[12:48:41] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: but then is only a single timeout right? i need to repeat that
[12:49:00] <Brodingo> have the setTimeout call itself again
[12:49:04] <sabaton> Xenefungus, let the function use settimeout on itself
[12:49:32] <Xenefungus> oh, thats smart!
[12:49:34] <Brodingo> t4nkd setTimeout(n * 1000)
[12:49:45] <Brodingo> with a function too of course
[12:49:50] <sabaton> Xenefungus, it is better than setinterval in some cases which also could be used
[12:50:05] <Brodingo> especially when using ajax
[12:50:08] <t4nkd> Okay so I can't do like, setTimeout($('foo').slideUp();, 1000) it's got to be a function for that
[12:50:13] <djQuery> $('.event').live('click', function(){   $(this).stop(true, true).toggleClass('colapsed').find('ui-icon').toggleClass('ui-icon-carat-1-s ui-icon-carat-1-n');});
[12:50:42] <Brodingo> setTimeout(function(){//code here}, n * 1000)
[12:50:55] <t4nkd> oh cool thanks bro
[12:50:59] <t4nkd> nice nick btw
[12:51:03] <Brodingo> no prob
[12:51:07] <Brodingo> THANKS BRO
[12:51:22] <t4nkd> You, I see what you did there
[12:51:27] <djQuery> pathauto: $('.event').live('click', function(){   $(this).stop(true, true).toggleClass('colapsed').find('ui-icon').toggleClass('ui-icon-carat-1-s ui-icon-carat-1-n');});
[12:52:28] <thefalling> Brodingo: hey i tried using an anon function, but that didnt work, no idea what im doin
[12:52:49] <Brodingo> poast coads
[12:53:16] <Krinkle> removeAttr sets name (if it matches the attributes-that-should-be-props) to false, removeProp sets to undefined and tries to delete it
[12:53:22] <Krinkle> That's kinda inconsistent
[12:53:27] <thefalling> Brodingo still dont understand why something like : $("[id^=shipCell]").easyTooltip({useElement: "displayShip" + ($(this).attr('id')).substring(15)	}); wont work
[12:53:39] <bluefirex> Hello :)
[12:53:50] <Krinkle> I'd expect removeAttr to do removeProp if the attribute name is in fact a property
[12:53:53] <Brodingo> $(this) likely doesnt have the right context
[12:53:59] <Krinkle> of course *I* will use removeProp anyway.
[12:54:30] <thefalling> how exactly do i do it then
[12:54:38] <Brodingo> $("[id^=shipCell]").easyTooltip({useElement: function(){ return "displayShip" + ($(this).attr('id')).substring(15)	;} });
[12:54:57] <pathauto> Does that get nested within $(document).ready(function(){ or nested further within the $("h4.trigger").click(function()?
[12:56:24] <mistermocha> still not sure what I'm doing wrong!!
[12:56:38] <pathauto> And how do I actually incorporate in the html?
[12:57:06] <pathauto> I just basically want to swap a couple of gif or png files
[12:57:11] <mistermocha> will just loading $.somefunction execute on page load, or will I have to do more?
[12:57:32] <pathauto> so by default, the one with the plus sign shows when closed and the one with the minus when the toggle is open.
[12:57:34] <Brodingo> $(function(){ myFunc(); });
[12:57:45] <chjj> git log
[12:57:49] <chjj> dammit
[12:57:56] <chjj> thats what i get for using a terminal client
[12:58:09] <Brodingo> mistermocha thats doc ready, page load is $(window).load(function(){ //coads });
[12:58:52] <mistermocha> Brodingo: well, what am I missing here: http://swan.bdweber.net/static/js/chapterLoader.js ??
[12:59:01] <Marak> SlexAxton: i heard you were talking smack about my rap skills
[12:59:08] <mistermocha> I put in the first line just to test whether or not something would happen
[12:59:27] <Marak> SlexAxton: i also heard you were trying to say the client-side is better then the server-side when it comes to JS
[12:59:29] <Marak> them fighting words
[12:59:48] <Brodingo> wrap it in a ready or load function
[12:59:58] <mistermocha> Brodingo: me?
[13:00:01] <Brodingo> yessir
[13:00:22] <mistermocha> ok... uh... googling...
[13:00:28] <Brodingo> ?ready
[13:00:30] <jesteracer> can someone help with jcrop, i need to block the user from clicking to the area, that is not cropped, in other words, the cropped area must allways be selected
[13:00:37] <Brodingo> dangit bot
[13:00:51] <djQuery> pathauto: I dont do pms
[13:01:12] <mistermocha> aha!
[13:01:15] <mistermocha> Brodingo: thx
[13:01:17] <Brodingo> mistermocha $(document).ready(function(){ //your code });
[13:01:19] <Brodingo> :)
[13:02:24] <thefalling> Brodingo: that didnt help, the anon function doesnt do anything i even tested $("[id^=shipCell]").easyTooltip({useElement: function() {return "displayShipBEDF01";}}); which doesnt work, but $("[id^=shipCell]").easyTooltip({useElement:  "displayShipBEDF01"}); works fine :S
[13:02:42] <mistermocha> squee!! thanks!
[13:07:18] <Xenefungus> hm why does "setInterval(alert("test"), 3000);" only show one alert and doesnt repeat it every 3 seconds?
[13:07:59] <phlp> setInterval(alert, 3000, "test");
[13:08:20] <Brodingo> you need to pass a function
[13:08:38] <Brodingo> else it just alerts immediately
[13:09:12] <Brodingo> also, i would recommend steering away from setInterval
[13:09:52] <ciss> Brodingo++
[13:10:48] <Xenefungus> phlp: awesome, thanks!
[13:11:03] <Xenefungus> Brodingo: ok, i did ir recursively with settimeout
[13:11:04] <Xenefungus> 		function recwait() {
[13:11:04] <Xenefungus> 			alert("test");
[13:11:04] <Xenefungus> 			setTimeout(recwait, 3000);
[13:11:04] <Xenefungus> 		}
[13:11:04] <Xenefungus> 		recwait();
[13:11:15] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[13:11:25] <Xenefungus> uhm did you get it?
[13:11:27] <pathauto> Does any know how I can modify this: http://www.mdsol.com/conferences/mug/js/toggle.js to show/hide an open.png and closed.png based on state?
[13:11:42] <Xenefungus> didnt want to flood, sorry
[13:11:47] <Brodingo> it happens
[13:11:48] <pathauto> grpahic would be before each link
[13:12:36] <Brodingo> you could use css based on active
[13:12:48] <Brodingo> :before, .active:before
[13:13:02] <Brodingo> and change background position of a sprite
[13:14:03] <pathauto> The original tutorial had a css sprite as a background image rather than text links. I tried the same thing with smaller images but it's revealing both images
[13:15:29] <pathauto> not sure I understand how those would be used in css
[13:15:43] <djQuery> pathauto: somethign like this. http://jsbin.com/udoqix/edit#javascript,html,live
[13:16:58] <tdignan> Is there an event for "when I changed the value of a select"?
[13:17:04] <Brodingo> ?change
[13:17:08] <Brodingo> fuuuu
[13:17:13] <tdignan> i got it
[13:17:15] <tdignan> thanks
[13:22:05] <pathauto> Thanks dj. There's nothing going on in that link. The rendered output is just showing a static list item with downward carat. For this, I'm just trying to find the path of least resistance as I don't want to have to go in and re-do a ton of css.code. I figured there might be a simple solution adding to either the js or css.
[13:22:39] <djQuery> pathauto: yeah I ddidnt test it but you should see what I am trying to do there
[13:24:09] <chris_> hey guys, whats wrong with this function? :(
[13:24:09] <chris_> 	  function del(var) { 	  $('#liste').removeClass(var); 	  }
[13:25:42] <ciss> Guest39407: nothing. what's the issue?
[13:25:57] <Guest39407> aah
[13:25:58] <Guest39407> got it
[13:26:00] <wookiehangover> var is a reserved word
[13:26:03] <Guest39407> shouzld not name it "var
[13:26:04] <Guest39407> y
[13:26:05] <Guest39407> thx^^
[13:26:35] <thefalling> Brodingo: how would i just assign to the useElement property inside the anon function?
[13:28:04] <Brodingo> i dunno i thought it would work, if you do a fiddle i could try to fork it and see whats up
[13:28:51] <thefalling> i get this error if it helps, using ur version and mine, "$(this).attr("id") is undefined"
[13:29:11] <sshaginyan> I know this is wrong http://pastie.org/2362929 but is there a way to do this?
[13:29:20] <Bower^> Hey. I've been trying to implement AJAX requests using jquery and PHP but I can't crack it. It would work but the same origin policy is kicking in. I must be misusing something or just misunderstand it. Can someone please take a look at http://pastebin.com/avUjbtUG and tell me how I could send back $artistName? As soon as I uncomment the code that grabs the XML doc it doesn't produce an output (seems the browser detects misuse)
[13:30:44] <sshaginyan> I actually don't even need success all I want is a callback function...
[13:31:17] <djQuery> pathauto: http://jsbin.com/udoqix/2/edit

[13:41:51] <peter123> can someone help me? why isnt this working: http://pastebin.com/i5wZGA5q
[13:42:39] <chovy> peter123: try a string instead of a number.
[13:42:56] <initself> i'm gonna go with I don't know Javascript on this one
[13:42:57] <initself> if (product.whse_001 >= qty.val()) {
[13:43:01] <chovy> peter123: or $(this).parent().remove();
[13:43:06] <initself> do i want >== or something?
[13:43:31] <mathi> this doesn't alert "TEST", what's wrong ?
[13:43:33] <mathi> $(html).find("#paramId").attr('name', 'TEST'); alert($(html).find("#paramId").attr('name'));
[13:43:44] <dimitris5> Im getting errors can you please help me fix them? I tried noconflict http://home.dakulov.eu:85/ituts.gr/
[13:44:51] <phlp> initself: parseInt(qty.val(),10)
[13:45:08] <initself> it's not an int already?
[13:45:25] <initself> Can I declare it as an int?
[13:45:35] <initself> qty       = $('input[name$="qty"]');
[13:45:43] <initself> phlp: i'll just do what you said
[13:45:50] <phlp> it's always a string
[13:45:54] <initself> ah
[13:45:56] <initself> that helps
[13:46:05] <initself> so i need my other one an int, too
[13:46:12] <thefalling> is there another way to set default options other than the ordinary .something({myOption: 'this'}); can i do it in a anon function?
[13:46:23] <initself> phlp: isn't the 10 radix a default?
[13:46:54] <phlp> initself: no the default is to guess based on the string. if it starts with a 0 you will get octal

[13:52:04] <Shishire> Am I missing something somewhere, or does neither javascript nor jquery have a standard array union function? e.g., x = [1,2,3,4]; y = [2,4,6]; x.union(y); x === [1,2,3,4,6];
[13:53:02] <phlp> ?js [1,2,3].concat([4,5,6]) @ Shishire
[13:53:03] <bot-t> Shishire: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[13:53:30] <Shishire> ?js [1,2,3].concat([2,4,5])
[13:53:30] <bot-t> Shishire: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]
[13:53:38] <Shishire> there are 2 "2"s
[13:54:45] <phlp> ?js $.unique([1,2,3].concat([2,4,5]))
[13:54:45] <bot-t> phlp: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]
[13:55:14] <phlp> it works, i promise
[13:55:20] <phlp> ?js $().jquery
[13:55:20] <bot-t> phlp: "1.4.2"
[13:55:27] <IMTheNachoMan> anyone have any ideas on the best marquee/scrolling plugin for jquery?
[13:57:05] <ajpiano> phlp: $.unique only works on arrays of dom elements

[14:09:52] <danheberden> ?ftj @ dimitris5
[14:09:52] <bot-t> dimitris5, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:10:29] <Shishire> dimitris5, you need to make sure to include the Bubble.js file as well.  You're currently just using grumble, but missing Bubble.  It's a dependancy.
[14:10:53] <dimitris5> Shishire: the example doesnt include it
[14:11:34] <Shishire> dimitris5, then the example is wrong.  The code actually wants a global object named Bubble, and complains when it doesn't get it.
[14:12:34] <dimitris5> Shishire: http://jamescryer.github.com/grumble.js/ the example
[14:13:54] <thefalling> is there another way to set default options other than the ordinary .something({myOption: 'this'}); can i do it in a anon function?
[14:16:08] <danheberden> dimitris5 Bubble is part of the minified JS in that example
[14:16:09] <danheberden> http://jamescryer.github.com/grumble.js/js/jquery.grumble.min.js?v=1
[14:16:14] <danheberden> it's just all concatenated
[14:16:27] <danheberden> the i.Bubble= part is window.Bubble=function..
[14:16:58] <danheberden> just poor naming on the example's part - should be 'scripts.js' or something
[14:17:22] <danheberden> thefalling you aren't being very specific
[14:17:24] <dimitris5> danheberden: you are right. Thanks a lot
[14:17:26] <danheberden> a plugin you're making?

[14:17:48] <danheberden> why are objects bad for options?
[14:17:59] <danheberden> ?xy @ thefalling
[14:18:00] <bot-t> thefalling, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[14:22:39] <eragon77> Hi guys
[14:22:42] <pathauto> @djQuery: I played around with the script you posted. I can get it to show the image and clicking on it allows the dropdown but the images aren't actually toggling. In any case, This would require me going in and rewriting how I have the current hide/show set up which is a good deal of code to go through. I thought there would be an easier way to just edit the script I'm already using. I'm playing around with css sprites right now bu

[14:36:42] <pathauto> @phlp Dude, you rock!
[14:37:36] <pathauto> That worked perfectly. The only thing I'm wondering about is if there is a better way to implement rather than using empty <span> tags for the image.
[14:37:48] <pathauto> Something more semantically correct.

[15:44:09] <richthegeek> hi, can anyone recommend a decent Javascript framework/lib/whatever for handling the front-end logic? Something along the lines of Knockout.js
[15:44:37] <sic1>  backbone.js, sproutcore
[15:44:48] <ajpiano> richthegeek backbone.js spine.js sproutcore are all similar to that
[15:44:52] <richthegeek> sic1: sproutcore is ruby isn't it?
[15:44:56] <sic1> i like backbone.js personally
[15:45:07] <ajpiano> me too
[15:45:13] <wookiehangover> me three!
[15:45:29] <sic1> naw its a js framework like the others, just real heavy with ui built in
[15:45:36] <sic1> ^ sproutcore
[15:45:38] <stevdev> i read backbone.js is more structured
[15:45:47] <richthegeek> sic1: huh, when I tried to download it was insisting I install it with a gem
[15:45:52] <stevdev> knockout is good for larger teams
[15:45:54] <sic1> there are things i like, and things i dont like about it
[15:46:03] <wookiehangover> backbone meant for RESTful apis
[15:46:13] <ajpiano> i have a sproutcore early adopter tshirt
[15:46:13] <wookiehangover> but you can use it for anything
[15:46:17] <ajpiano> but i've never used it
[15:46:17] <ajpiano> lol
[15:46:21] <wookiehangover> ha
[15:46:26] <sic1> hah
[15:46:34] <sic1> always was just too heavy
[15:46:42] <sic1> specially when u always have to do custom ui
[15:46:44] <richthegeek> currently using Laravel as the REST API backend
[15:46:45] <ajpiano> its just so damn cute
[15:46:50] <richthegeek> trying to find what to use on the frontend
[15:47:28] <ceej> what's the best way to get the current index of an element?
[15:47:35] <sic1> i really need to put out my real simple MVC wrapper...doesnt have all the goodness of backbone
[15:47:43] <sic1> but does it nice
[15:48:13] <sic1> current index of an element in a stack...say like the index of an li within a ul?
[15:49:45] <ceej> ye
[15:50:20] <ceej> so if I had a ul and I select an li inside, I want to get the number the li is in the list
[15:51:12] <ceej> I essentially I want to get the element type and number that is
[15:51:22] <sic1> well, not sure if anyone has better ways
[15:51:23] <wookiehangover> $('ul').children('> li').length
[15:51:32] <sic1> there it is
[15:51:40] <sic1> :X
[15:51:51] <wookiehangover> or $('ul > li').length
[15:52:07] <wookiehangover> obviously scoped to the ul you want to target
[15:52:09] <ceej> I'm already inside that element
[15:52:25] <ceej> it could be a td also or a div inside a div etc..
[15:52:30] <wookiehangover> $('li').siblings().length
[15:52:37] <Arch_> I want to do a blur-like event where if I click away from an object another object hides UNLESS I'm clicking in the object that is to be hidden. Is this possible?
[15:52:55] <sic1> $li.parent().children().index( $li ) ...
[15:53:19] <sic1> i think ur lookin for something more like that from where ur targeting...
[15:53:23] <sic1> maybe im off
[15:53:36] <wookiehangover> siblings() would be better in that case
[15:53:58] <sic1> dont u need to add self to it then?
[15:55:40] <richthegeek> ok, any links to decent tutorials for backbone.js?
[15:55:57] <stevdev> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/hh377172.aspx
[15:56:12] <richthegeek> well I never... a useful article on MSDN
[15:56:17] <ceej> thank you all
[15:56:20] <sic1> lol, its a good one too
[15:56:38] <wookiehangover> their scriptjunkie blog is surprisingly not complete shit
[15:57:01] <richthegeek> I don't think I've seen any site with a higher waste:content ratio
[15:57:07] <richthegeek> *maybe* Answers.com
[15:57:31] <donburks> w3schools
[15:57:44] <richthegeek> that's useful to the most n00bish of us
[15:58:22] <donburks> Well yes, I suppose. The same way explosives are useful to children.
[15:58:40] <richthegeek> well it handily lists the various properties of most CSS 2.1 stuff
[15:58:48] <richthegeek> and most Javascript native stuff

[16:02:37] <sic1> so, check this out...foursquare is telling me that i need to send a POST...well i am, did it thru $.post( 'url', data )
[16:03:01] <sic1> then i did one with all ajax settings, watching as tehy came in and out, type always was POST
[16:03:11] <sic1> so THEN i did a curl -d ... the post when thru
[16:03:24] <sic1> from terminal
[16:03:34] <sic1> so...anyone know what kinda ajax options curl -d has?
[16:03:37] <wookiehangover> does it need type "application/json"
[16:03:37] <ajpiano> you can't do cross domain ajax
[16:03:43] <wookiehangover> nvm
[16:03:48] <ajpiano> curl is not the same as an ajax request
[16:03:49] <sic1> well, i can from where i am :)
[16:03:57] <sic1> maybe its messin it up
[16:04:04] <ajpiano> sic1 where are you? not a browser?
[16:04:13] <IMTheNachoMan> how can i wrap all elements in a collection in a parent element?

[16:25:25] <Bower^> Hey. I'm new to jquery and javascript in general. I'm hoping someone can explain something to me. http://pastebin.com/sydTyxpt - I would expect that to perform as follows: Once the page has fully loaded, attach some function calls to the two buttons. Once the user clicks the construct button, the JSON data should be assigned to the currentJSON global. When the user then clicks on the get album title button it should display some value stored in that var. It o
[16:25:26] <Bower^> nly works when I uncomment the call to constructJSON() within the document ready bit and I'm not quite sure why. Could someone give a basic explanation on this?
[16:26:27] <Bower^> Well I know that the object doesn't get constructed (it stays null) but I'm not sure why
[16:26:51] <Bower^> Any general help would be much appreciated :)
[16:28:00] <sic1> lookin
[16:28:07] <Bower^> thanks dude
[16:28:43] <Bower^> The code doesn't actually do anything interesting, I'm just learning how things work :)
[16:29:07] <sic1> u should use http://jsfiddle.net/ to set these up
[16:29:14] <sic1> makes for very easy rapid tests
[16:29:28] <Bower^> I assumed it wouldn't work with jquery
[16:29:49] <sic1> :)
[16:29:52] <sic1> they got u covered
[16:30:06] <sic1> check it out...lots of options on the side to toggle

[16:31:12] <sic1> im just sayin...
[16:31:21] <Bower^> just an example i grabbed from last.fm's api tutorial page
[16:31:47] <sic1> lmao
[16:32:01] <sic1> im takin a look bud, but im sure it has to do with how u are tryin to structure it
[16:32:19] <Bower^> well i'm dude I'm really new to this
[16:32:25] <Bower^> I'm appreciate some structure advice
[16:32:40] <Bower^> urgh i need coffee
[16:32:45] <Bower^> excuse the terrible english lol
[16:34:21] <Bower^> I can't see why it wouldn't work though
[16:34:32] <sic1> i got u, just putting it together better
[16:35:02] <Bower^> cool
[16:38:21] <Krinkle> sic1: .length is relatively cheap compared to real object members since the Array constructor's native implementation has some way of caching it as well (in that, it doesn't have to "count" how long the array is)
[16:39:12] <Krinkle> but especially multilevel objects are often pitfalls when placed inside loops that are in central parts of a web app. It can make a difference when combined with other improvements.

[16:39:40] <Krinkle> cross-domain ?
[16:39:59] <sic1> thanks krinkle
[16:40:02] <Krinkle> perhaps use a callback (if not already)
[16:40:09] <sic1> and yea... its cross-domain
[16:40:21] <sic1> and it seeeems to be going thru, but foursquare is shooting it down

[16:40:46] <sic1> im tryin all sorts of options...hard to put in a fiddle tho...
[16:40:51] <Krinkle> it does support callbacks
[16:40:55] <Krinkle> so cross-domain isn't an issue
[16:41:17] <sic1> doh were u talkin about my earlier Question>?
[16:41:29] <sic1> or bowers?
[16:41:35] <Krinkle> sic1: I was referring to the jsfiddle link you sent
[16:41:38] <sic1> bowers dont need a callback, jquery does that
[16:41:44] <Krinkle> I know
[16:41:45] <sic1> no need
[16:41:48] <sic1> :P
[16:41:57] <sic1> gahhh brb
[16:42:02] <Krinkle> sic1: that code doesn't work since the access to myData is outside the callback

[16:50:25] <ajpiano> DerNalia: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[16:50:54] <Krinkle> Bower^: http://jsfiddle.net/htSHy/2/
[16:52:06] <Bower^> I see! Thank you very much Krinkle
[16:52:15] <Krinkle> DerNalia: Remove the " () " after renderLayout. () means to execute a function, you don't want that. you want the bind-event to execute it
[16:52:28] <Krinkle> Bower^: Notice the callback=?
[16:52:46] <Krinkle> sic1: Seems jQuery doesn't' automatically do it for getJSON, at least not in Chrome
[16:52:47] <Bower^> Yeah I've encountered it
[16:52:48] <DerNalia> @Krinkle oh, thanks!
[16:52:59] <DerNalia> @ajpiano, I don't have any ajax yet
[16:53:06] <Krinkle> Bower^: btw, also look at the other small changes I made!
[16:53:12] <ajpiano> DerNalia: did you look at slide 32, it has nothing to do with ajax
[16:53:21] <Krinkle> such as click(function(){ foo(); }) -> click( foo )
[16:53:37] <Bower^> I'll look at it carefully after my cup of tea. Really appreciate that dude :D
[16:53:41] <ajpiano> DerNalia: it is what Krinkle just said... you are executing the function instead of referencing it to be executing on the event
[16:54:05] <DerNalia> @ajpiano: oh, lol. I somehow got on the AJAX part =\
[17:00:09] <ArmOrAttAk> do dropdown menus work in ie8?
[17:01:10] <sic1> yea i had to play a game-o-foosball - now its 5! that worked well. Bower^ u good?
[17:01:44] <sic1> well im out, cheers!
[17:01:50] <Bower^> yea thanks sic1
[17:02:04] <Bower^> cya man
[17:03:15] <Bower^> Krinkle, I think that fiddle you posted is really nice. Is that how you would personally do it?
[17:03:26] <Krinkle> yes
[17:03:32] <Bower^> Excluding stuff like js in the html and stuff
[17:03:35] <Bower^> nice
[17:03:40] <Bower^> Well thanks again
[17:04:11] <Krinkle> Well, when I create a new fiddle I'd put the script in the bottom left part of the jsFiddle, not in a <script> tag
[17:04:29] <Krinkle> But otherwise that's how I'd do it.
[17:08:03] <ArmOrAttAk> do dropdown menus work in ie8?
[17:08:21] <silo> yes
[17:08:42] <ArmOrAttAk> what do we have to do different?
[17:08:50] <ArmOrAttAk> to get them working?
[17:09:07] <silo> depends what your doing
[17:09:23] <silo> Are you using an out of the box dropdown menu?
[17:09:52] <ArmOrAttAk> yes
[17:10:00] <ArmOrAttAk> out of the jquery box
[17:10:19] <silo> whats it called?
[17:11:52] <ArmOrAttAk> i don't know let me check/
[17:14:51] <ArmOrAttAk> silo: http://pastebin.com/Z3QEfCBM
[17:16:16] <silo> hrmm
[17:16:25] <silo> that looks like it should work in ie8
[17:16:33] <silo> could just be a css issue
[17:16:47] <ArmOrAttAk> works in  other browsers
[17:16:52] <silo> tbh I am so tired I can't decipher any more code
[17:16:59] <ArmOrAttAk> okay
[17:17:03] <silo> its 1am i need sleep :>
[17:17:24] <silo> the submenu .li don't show up?
[17:17:53] <ArmOrAttAk> right
[17:51:31] <daleharvey> anyone know where the code for fastclick is done in jquery mobile?
[18:06:15] <djQuery1> ?fastclick
[18:06:19] <bot-t> djQuery1, Widgets - Documentation - http://docs.jquery.com/action/render/UI/Changelog/1.7?diff=prev&oldid=14182&
[18:16:27] <cedrichurst> so i'm looking to xhr with jquery such that the message body contains a json represenation of shared object state (a la rest)
[18:17:02] <cedrichurst> ah the moment, when i try to PUT a json object as data, it gets flattened out as params (key/value pairs)
[18:17:10] <cedrichurst> is there a way to avoid this?
[18:18:07] <daleharvey> cedrichurst: set the Content-Type
[18:19:02] <cedrichurst> ah, cool
[18:19:06] <cedrichurst> i'll try that, thanks
[18:20:01] <daleharvey> its a guess, dataType:"json" might also help
[18:20:30] <cedrichurst> tried the dataType route
[18:20:43] <cedrichurst> but after you mentioned contentType, i found a section in the docs which mentioned processData
[18:20:55] <cedrichurst> if i set it to false, it should bypass the conversion to parameters
[18:21:05] <cedrichurst> so i'll use that in conjunction with setting the content type
[18:21:25] <daleharvey> oh and you will also be wanting to use data: JSON.stringify(json)
[18:21:31] <daleharvey> and not just data: json
[18:21:52] <cedrichurst> JSON is provided by jquery or ecmascript?
[18:22:25] <daleharvey> its native in all modern browsers, crockford has a fallback library for older browsers
[18:55:57] <DAKSH> is jqeury ui widgets can run with jquery mobile? I am asking because I have no idea baout jquery mobile or wap
[19:01:15] <tallisman> Anyone here? If so.. is it possible to submit content into a textarea with the cursor actually moving..?
[19:06:09] <chjj> tallisman: what do you mean "submit content into a textarea"?
[19:07:13] <tallisman> well, you click a button, say, 'hello', and the text hello gets inserted into the textarea.
[19:07:37] <tallisman> Well, I figured that far.. but I want the cursor to jump to the end of the
[19:07:52] <tallisman> 'e' as well.
[19:07:56] <chjj> you can modify textContent or value, which are `text` and `val` in jquery if i remember right
[19:08:19] <chjj> oh
[19:08:39] <chjj> well there is selection api, but i dont think its supported by legacy browsers, maybe someone can correct me
[19:10:45] <chjj> whether theres a jquery abstraction for it, i dont know, i dont use jquery anymore
[19:11:05] <kborchers> tallisman: so you want the cursor to move to the end of the content in the textarea after you insert content right?
[19:11:19] <tallisman> yes
[19:11:36] <tallisman> preferably to the end of the inserted content.
[19:11:58] <kborchers> are you not inserting at the end?
[19:12:14] <tallisman> depends on the location of the cursor, I insert where the cursor is
[19:13:06] <chjj> there is a setSelectionRange method and selectionStart/End properties, but i doubt theyre supported by legacy browsers
[19:13:29] <chjj> otherwise you can move the caret wherever you want
[19:13:49] <tallisman> setSelectionRange works, but only on textarea. selectionStart does not work in chrome.. I believe
[19:14:20] <chjj> sorry, i thought you were talking about a textarea?
[19:14:33] <tallisman> in general I am
[19:14:42] <tallisman> so setSelectionRange does suffice
[19:15:19] <tallisman> But textarea has it's drawbacks as well :p, html is just text.

[20:08:13] <lucasoman> what's the name of that js bookmark that allows you to debug jquery events

[21:51:02] <courpse> Thats the lamest attempt of a flood i've ever seen...
[21:51:22] <cedrichurst> getting his as well: Received CTCP 'VERSION' (to cedrichurst) from Angstrom_
[21:52:40] <tbranyen> if you're gonna flood at least use space jam lyrics
[21:52:51] <paul_irish> tbranyen:  :)
[21:52:57] <tbranyen> :-p
[21:54:19] <paul_irish> so
[21:54:24] <paul_irish> any jquery questions ?! :D
[21:55:22] <vladikoff> what's your favourite jquery?
[21:55:36] <tbranyen> 1.4.4 because its my favorite number
[21:56:00] <vladikoff> i kinda liked 1.4.2
[21:56:03] <paul_irish> 1.2.6 has a special place in my heart
[21:56:08] <vladikoff> :)
[21:56:22] <zoggy> is there ever going to be a jquery validator or jquery lint style app?
[21:56:29] <paul_irish> yes
[21:56:31] <paul_irish> there already is
[21:56:36] <paul_irish> ?g padolsey jquery lint
[21:56:37] <bot-t1> paul_irish, jQuery Lint  James Padolsey - http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-lint/
[21:56:43] <paul_irish> its integrated into jsfiddle even.
[21:56:52] <zoggy> well nm then
[21:56:54] <paul_irish> :)
[21:56:55] <cedrichurst> my favorite jquery is $('input[name="foo"]')
[21:57:02] <paul_irish> could use some maintenance though
[21:57:02] <vladikoff> zoggy, you get a jquery!
[21:57:12] <paul_irish> cedrichurst: good thing you throw quotes on that bitch
[21:57:27] <cedrichurst> is it?
[21:57:45] <paul_irish> yah on the foo
[21:57:58] <zoggy> just seems like there are 20 ways to do the same thing in jquery... which may be flexible but what if you want a more strict/proper way of doing stuff
[21:57:58] <paul_irish> rules are vague around it but its good to quote that shit
[21:58:12] <cedrichurst> yeah, i always have
[21:59:38] <wookiehangover> not quoting that shit can lead to serious pain-in-the-assness
[21:59:54] <paul_irish> ^_^
[22:02:06] <zoggy> when is the jquery ui theme builder getting redone?
[22:03:29] <wookiehangover> dunno. might be on the roadmap tho http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[22:05:58] <zoggy> paul_irish, i have a jquery ui question for ya... autocomplete.. whats the proper way to have it bold the matching text in the autocomplete result.. this was alredy built in from the original autocomplete before it was intergrated into jquery ui
[22:06:11] * paul_irish shrugs
[22:13:49] <hamiltop> So I'm a little confused by the .data() function.  Where is that data stored?
[22:15:22] <wookiehangover> if you assign something with .data('foo'), it will live in memory
[22:16:01] <wookiehangover> as in, you won't see a data attribute created on the DOM node
[22:17:15] <wookiehangover> sorry, i meant .data('foo','bar')
[22:17:53] <wookiehangover> but if you have a data-attribute in your markup, you can get at it with .data()
[22:19:09] <hamiltop> can you see it in the "scope variables" of Chrome?
[22:21:45] <wookiehangover> ?tias
[22:23:15] <coldhead> ?tias
[22:23:15] <bot-t> Try It And See
[22:23:22] <coldhead> thanks bot-o
[22:23:34] <wookiehangover> i just gave up
[22:24:01] <coldhead> i didn't want to leave anyone wondering what you meant
[23:17:13] <iman> how can find what textfield is focused when happen clicking in webpage ?
[23:24:07] <raiun> If i have a json object Person and that has a property of "name" how do i access that property
[23:24:13] <raiun> cus Person.name is saying "undefined"
[23:30:47] <thomedy> okay if anyone is willing im useing jquery to run a very simple ajax query and ive done it before a very similar version and im not sure why its not working
[23:31:01] <_wired> hey guys. anyone here keen in taking up a quick jquery + GD project? probably wont take more than a few hours of your time :) can pay you today/tomorrow, too.
[23:31:17] <thomedy> im booked sorry
[23:31:59] <_wired> no need to write any new libraries or stuff though, already have the sample code but just looking for someone to put together
[23:32:01] <thomedy> besides my knowledge is just now exiting novice and entering qualified maybe so im not sure if i your guy
[23:36:34] <djQuery1> gd?
[23:36:55] <thomedy> $.post('file.php');
[23:36:57] <_wired> yea, PHP-GD
[23:37:08] <thomedy> thats the most basic post ajax right
[23:38:01] <_wired> client-side jquery: resize, drag, rotate (have sample code) instances of image onto canvas. server-side: turn whatever seen in client-side into a real image via GD or ImageMagick
[23:38:15] <_wired> up for it? :)
[23:47:54] <iman> how can I get event source of clicking of whole of page ?
