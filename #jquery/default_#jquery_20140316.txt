[00:10:11] <basiclaser> hey chaps. Im making this webapp ATM, i want it to use local storage, store values based on toggling buttons, calculates periods between toggling in hours, across multiple days, then displays information in piecharts.. It's all new to me :P where do i start? how do you guys plan building logic systems?
[00:10:18] <basiclaser> i wrote a huge list of all the subtasks
[00:10:31] <basiclaser> dont know where is bes t to start
[00:50:38] <aidan> So I'm making a super simple jquery plugin to list files on AWS, looks like this: http://share.aidanlister.com/URUU
[01:00:11] <aidan> http://jsfiddle.net/JFysR/
[01:00:33] <aidan> Let me generate an empty bucket / credentials
[01:04:38] <davan> Hi there, did any1 encounter a strange behavior with 'setInterval();' - when i move my mouse slowly (on.('mousehover')) my clearInterval is working correct, when i move my mouse fast over elements which fire a call - than my clearInterval mechanism is not working anymore - anywhere - any ideas?
[01:16:58] <mouses> anybody up?
[01:19:04] <mouses> i have <section id="main"><div id="main-inner"> ... </div></section>  and #main-inner {width:1280px}
[01:19:17] <mouses> works fine on desktop windows, mac
[01:19:38] <mouses> but on mobile, main will be 965px and main-inner is 1280px
[01:19:47] <mouses> wtf
[01:20:33] <mouses> i tried #main{width:100%} - no effect
[01:20:55] <mouses> i want main (the outter section) to be the page width
[01:23:41] <beancurd> mouses: is this mobile on the actual screen? or are you using emulator in chrome/ff
[01:24:11] <mouses> both
[01:24:22] <mouses> on my phone, it looks the same as emulator in chrome
[01:24:40] <mouses> well i didnt try width:100% on the actual phone
[01:25:10] <mouses> but the problem of the default outter element being 965px is confirmed on both phone and emulator
[01:25:16] <beancurd> just mess around in the emulator, look at the metrics window/calculated thing.
[01:27:27] <mouses> nowhere in my css do i specify 965px width for the outter element
[01:28:47] <aidan> http://jsfiddle.net/JFysR/3/
[01:30:18] <beancurd> yep. in your inspector, look at the computed width for the element and see what's causing it
[01:31:09] <mouses> 965px is computed
[01:31:23] <mouses> trying to figure out why but no parent element is specifying it
[01:31:45] <mouses> thats only in the mobile emulator though
[01:31:57] <mouses> and on the actual mobile device
[01:32:05] <aidan> Alright ... so ... can anyone think of a neat way to indent for each folder?
[01:32:09] <mouses> but not when i use desktop as normal
[01:32:25] <aidan> You've got foo/ foo/a foo/b ... and I'd want to produce a nested list for that
[01:40:50] <Thoams> I got used to using Opera's Dragonfly inspector many moons ago
[01:41:08] <Thoams> and find every other inspector woefully lacking
[01:42:28] <Thoams> largely for the fact that it immediately upon invoke provides you with layout lines and padding / margin visual feedback over the hovered element
[01:43:15] <Thoams> every other inspector I've used a) demands that I hit a button and b) doesn't have anything like the guides
[01:56:50] <edoop> why  html  files starts  with  <!doctype html>

[02:28:22] <lima_web> Hey, any Idea to get rid off my "undefined" and why it happen in my concatenation ? http://jsfiddle.net/eA45S/

[02:47:05] <axilaris> wonder u guys can help me... i'ved got my code in github https://github.com/axilaris/bootstrapmodal/blob/master/app/views/posts/_form.html.erb
[02:47:17] <axilaris> and im trying bootstrap modal
[02:47:54] <axilaris> the modal works... but when i click on ok, it goes to okClicked(), but somehow the parent form is cleared
[02:48:26] <axilaris> $('#windowCreateInvoiceProductDialog').modal('hide');  is there a way to dismiss the modal window without touching the parent ?
[03:07:26] <damaya> Say that I am using a plugin, and I instantiate that plugin like so: $('element').plugin({options});
[03:08:03] <damaya> Now, say that plugin has a method (let's call it methodY), and I want to apply methodY to anything matching the following classes: classA, classB, and classC.
[03:08:40] <damaya> Now, I write my own extension to that plugin, and I then do $('.classA).mymethod({options}); and so on for each class.
[03:08:47] <aidan> http://jsfiddle.net/JFysR/4/
[03:08:50] <aidan> looking good
[03:09:08] <damaya> My question now is this: How do I use methodY from the plugin in my own plugin?
[03:09:45] <damaya> Does that make sense? Do I pass the object as a parameter to my plugin?
[03:11:36] <damaya> Oh wow, wait a second. I think I am approaching jquery from a completely misguided perspective (i.e., it's not like Java, C++, etc).
[03:12:18] <damaya> So, I can say $('element').myplugin({options}) and it seems that my plugin inherits the functions of the other plugin... I.e., jquery doesn't have namespaces?
[03:15:51] <damaya> all functions are global? Or functions are inherited by scripts called after a script?
[03:36:51] <Thoams> not in strict javascript
[03:37:21] <Thoams> generally objects are global: they're attached to the window namespace
[03:37:35] <Thoams> then you have scope
[03:43:39] <Thoams> and no jquery is not like java, c++, etc - it's a framework which abstracts away from pure javascript and in so doing helps to unify the multitude of browser implementation abberations
[03:43:41] <damaya> I'm gonna need to read a book :D
[03:43:58] <Thoams> I could have worded that better but I'm three sheets to the proverbial
[03:44:07] <damaya> I figured I'd just get it, but it's different than most programming I've done in a few ways. It's awesome as hell though.
[03:44:15] <Thoams> books are highly recommended
[03:44:20] <damaya> Thoams, no, I got it... thanks ;)
[03:44:45] <Thoams> cool.
[03:45:27] <Thoams> get a herbert schildt reference on javascript if you want a long read and an upsetting migraine
[03:45:46] <Thoams> other than that, jquery api references are plenty good.
[03:47:24] <Thoams> wish the damned sortables wouldn't capture my draggables when they're tucked away in an overflow-x: scroll div though.
[03:47:51] <Thoams> all... causin' random unwanted related-product-page associations 'n' shit.
[03:47:55] <Thoams> :\
[03:51:23] <damaya> I've been checking out the API docs a bit. I just like more of a tutorial to learn, then the API docs would be a great reference.
[03:53:23] <Thoams> You'll do well. Crack on.
[04:04:28] <herol3oy> Hi. is there any chance to find the jquery source of this page?
[04:04:30] <herol3oy> luladesigns.com
[04:06:01] <damaya> herol3oy, for things I've that nature I've been using Firebug. I know Chrome has built in developer tools if you're using Chrome.
[04:06:07] <beancurd> t's right there on the page.
[04:06:09] <beancurd> i
[04:06:34] <beancurd> looks like it's just supersized.js?
[04:08:04] <herol3oy> so if i have that js file, that's all?
[04:08:17] <herol3oy> how can i do that with my photos?
[04:08:25] <herol3oy> is that complicated/
[04:08:31] <beancurd> http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/
[04:08:46] <beancurd> go there, download, then look at demos, replace with your stuff. done.
[04:08:46] <herol3oy> act i'm a UI desginger and photographer but not a programmer :(
[04:09:07] <beancurd> oh, in that case, ... yeah.. do that. go here: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/
[04:09:15] <beancurd> download the demo, and just start replacing stuff.
[04:10:19] <Thoams> are you aware of nielsen's ten ux heuristics
[04:11:47] <herol3oy> beancurd: hey tnx. i downloaded it but inside the zip file there is no index file
[04:11:49] <herol3oy> ?
[04:15:35] <beancurd> inside core/core.html
[04:15:56] <beancurd> slideshow/demo.html
[04:15:59] <beancurd> fade.html
[04:16:00] <beancurd> etc etc.
[04:16:53] <herol3oy> beancurd: so shalll i rename them to index.html and put my images in images folder and change the links and upload them on my web server, yeah?
[04:17:12] <beancurd> pretty much? get it working on your local computer first, then upload it.
[04:18:12] <herol3oy> beancurd: tnx. got it. but what about this one? http://slideme.luigiferraresi.it/
[04:18:33] <herol3oy> cause there is only two files inside the zip file?
[04:18:49] <beancurd> look at setup, it tells you what to put in your html.
[04:40:58] <Riztonnn> Hello
[04:41:55] <Riztonnn> I would like to understand what is exactly "click" event on ipad and if it works fine binding this event with jquery ? I am asking this question because I dont own an ipad
[04:42:41] <Riztonnn> some people do hacky stuff like that : http://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/jquery-click-events-ipad why ?
[04:51:55] <jop008> Is there a way to remove tokens like this Nîmes => make it Nimes
[04:54:52] <jop008> I am using autocomplete is it possible to extend the number of items shown?

[07:07:34] <jop008> How to trap the loose focus of a selectbox? I tried blur but no success
[07:09:38] <systemfault> Should work.
[07:09:48] <systemfault> How are you doing it?
[07:09:58] <systemfault> mySelect.on('blur', function() {}) ?
[07:12:59] <jop008> how to trap the blur event of a selectlist?
[07:13:00] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/C3veS/
[07:13:22] <systemfault> Your code works.
[07:13:22] <jop008> when the user clicked outside the select box I want to hide it right away
[07:13:56] <systemfault> The code you just pasted.. works.
[07:14:16] <jop008> No click outside the select no alert
[07:14:25] <jop008> only after the focus it fires
[07:14:33] <systemfault> ...
[07:14:37] <beancurd> it's firing for me :/
[07:14:44] <systemfault> blur == LOST OF FOCUS
[07:14:51] <jop008> I know
[07:14:53] <beancurd> 'blur event is firing'
[07:15:06] <jop008> I don't have it seamonkey browser
[07:15:31] <jop008> also on FF not
[07:15:40] <beancurd> i'm on ff, works fine.
[07:15:49] <jop008> I am on Apple
[07:15:53] <beancurd> ff 27.0.1
[07:16:17] <jop008> Same version
[07:16:42] <beancurd> yep, on osx here.
[07:16:45] <jop008> On chrome also no alert
[07:17:09] <beancurd> yeah, works fine here.
[07:17:16] <beancurd> also, why alert, and not console.log?
[07:17:31] <jop008> not my fiddle
[07:17:38] <jop008> keep to the issue please
[07:18:13] <jop008> So if you click outside the select box you got an alert?
[07:18:28] <beancurd> yeah dude, select something from the dropdown, then click outside. totally get an alert.
[07:18:46] <jop008> No immeadeatly click outside
[07:18:52] <jop008> not touching the select
[07:19:07] <kborchers> jop008: that is not a blur then because the select needs focus first
[07:19:24] <jop008> So how to handle this requirement?
[07:19:32] <beancurd> it triggers if you click twice.
[07:19:41] <beancurd> on the document.
[07:20:00] <jop008> So there is no way to do this?
[07:20:18] <beancurd> i still have no idea what you're trying to do.
[07:20:26] <beancurd> what's the use case here.
[07:20:27] <jop008> I create a selectlist on the fly and if users don't use it it must be hidden
[07:20:52] <jop008> Must I repeat it hide the select when clikcing somewhere
[07:21:35] <beancurd> ok, bind a click event on the document, check value of select box, then hide it if the value isn't set
[07:21:49] <beancurd> kekeke
[07:22:12] <jop008> but if the click on the select then the document trigger will also fire?
[07:23:00] <beancurd> you can go stoppropagation on the click
[07:23:16] <beancurd> http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[07:23:34] <beancurd> this is probably all terrible advice. but it'll work, probably.
[07:23:57] <kborchers> jop008: this sounds like a terrible UI. what if i accidentally click on the document? now i don't have that select that i may still need
[07:23:58] <jop008> so this must be used on the selectlist?
[07:24:41] <beancurd> kborchers: KEEP TO THE ISSUE YO
[07:24:44] <jop008> No they hit it by accident they can easily pop up the selectbox again
[07:24:47] <beancurd> kekeke.
[07:26:29] <aedwards88> I am trying to decide on using Jquery Mobile or Sencha Touch which is better for creating a quick application that will work great on mobile devices.
[07:26:52] <kborchers> aedwards88: i imagine you will get a slightly biased opinion here ;)
[07:27:41] <aedwards88> kborchers: Lol I agree I like the fact Sencha is MVC based I was looking to get the same features from Jquery Mobile.
[07:28:00] <beancurd> the last time i used jquery mobile it was clunky and slow, is that still the case now?
[07:28:20] <aedwards88> beancurd: I am wondering the same thing.
[07:29:15] <beancurd> aedwards88: it's not free, but kendo ui could be an option too?
[07:29:45] <beancurd> i've  never used it, bet the sales guy who came by the other time tried tell it like it was the second coming.
[07:30:32] <aedwards88> beancurd: I was looking into kendo, then I came on to Sencha Touch which seems promising. It uses MVC which is great for my use case of building a app that is maintainable. I was wondering if jquery mobile has a similar functionality. Having multiple pages seems to be a nightmare in Jquery Mobile.
[07:31:17] <aedwards88> Has any one created a application in jquery mobile with multiple pages?
[07:31:46] <beancurd> i've only had limited experience with jquery mobile, doing catalogue sites. this was about 2 years ago.
[07:32:10] <beancurd> wow. 2 years..
[07:32:29] <aedwards88> Currently I am trying to build a social network app, need to build quite quickly.
[07:32:54] <beancurd> why not go responsive web app route?
[07:33:24] <beancurd> jquery mobile / other js mobile frameworks seems like a lot of overhead ontop of having to build the app as well.
[07:33:39] <aedwards88> What do you mean beancurd. Just create a mobile web app using a framework such as bootstrap?
[07:33:47] <beancurd> yeah.
[07:33:51] <aedwards88> For the UI.
[07:33:59] <aedwards88> Hmm have not thought of it that way.
[07:34:07] <aedwards88> You make a valid point.
[07:34:32] <beancurd> i mean, look at this.
[07:34:34] <beancurd> http://cdn.mosaicpro.biz/social/php/admin/index.html?lang=en&v=v1.0.1-rc2
[07:34:49] <aedwards88> beancurd: I was also looking into this http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/
[07:34:59] <aedwards88> HTML5 mobile boilerplate.
[07:35:08] <aedwards88> Pretty lean, quick easy to use.
[07:35:23] <beancurd> yeah, or you could roll your own with bootstrap/boilerplate.
[07:35:56] <beancurd> or you could just take pre-bulit one and customise it to your needs, worry about making the product better, if it hits off, come back and clean up the frontend.
[07:37:04] <aedwards88> beancurd: This is awesome!!
[07:38:10] <beancurd> there's a bunch of them on themeforest,
[07:38:52] <beancurd> the one i linked is here: http://themeforest.net/item/social-network-admin-website-template/6767145
[07:39:22] <beancurd> but it looks like there's a couple of social networky ones.
[07:41:03] <aedwards88> beancurd: This looks great, the only issue is getting touch actions to work well with mobile.
[07:41:56] <aedwards88> But then again Jquery mobile for the most part uses Jquery. No reason why I cannot add what I need as I need it rather than loading all the bloat of Jquery Mobile.
[07:42:53] <aedwards88> Not to say I dislike Jquery Mobile, but for a large complex application it becomes very sluggish for me..
[07:43:15] <beancurd> that was the case when I used it.
[07:44:08] <beancurd> it's always going to be a pain in the ass to get touch actions to work well, but for the most part, swipe / double tap should be ok with a couple of plugins.
[07:44:21] <beancurd> just stay away from pinchzoom.
[08:01:36] <javalover> i'm going to code this myself just asking are there any jquery plugins for photo uploads?
[08:01:56] <javalover> ones that would have like "link" so you could put a link. Or "browse" and pick the file you want to upload
[08:02:09] <javalover> it's fine i'll google
[08:05:44] <aedwards88> javalover: Is this for a mobile application
[08:06:25] <javalover> nah
[08:06:27] <javalover> I found this: http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[08:06:30] <javalover> i really like it
[08:06:51] <javalover> I think for mobile i'd just use the api
[08:07:06] <javalover> in fact that's a great question
[08:07:19] <aedwards88> If so you need to access actual mechanics of the device. Jquery is not going to do this for you. I would recommend looking into Phonegap,
[08:07:37] <javalover> *cringe* at site of phonegap
[08:07:41] <aedwards88> You can use this if you have a backend programming language which will handle the file.
[08:08:00] <aedwards88> Such as PHP the issue is that you need a backend technology which will handle the file upload.
[08:08:15] <javalover> this is an interesting issue
[08:08:21] <javalover> that I never thought about as i'm doing desktop right now but
[08:08:30] <javalover> or "web app" if you will
[08:08:31] <aedwards88> Cool this will work great for you.
[08:08:41] <aedwards88> I have used this in the past. Go for it.
[08:08:55] <javalover> *not sureeee if trolling or helping* Fry Lock pic here
[08:09:20] <javalover> no I appreciate it
[08:09:23] <javalover> thx for your help edwards
[08:14:06] <aedwards88> beancurd: Thanks for the advice. I will proceed with the mobile web app route. Down the road I can convert to use a platform like Sencha. It is really not that bad to use I just do not have time to learn a entire new platform at the moment. Thank you again for your advice you really helped me a lot.
[09:42:01] <jop008> I I asked also in PHP in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/C3veS/18/ at server site $_POST["param"] is not set but why?
[09:54:37] <Voyage> hi
[09:54:46] <Voyage> why is this not working ? any clue http://jsfiddle.net/7JETU/2/ ?
[09:59:06] <systemfault> Voyage: Because "return" doesn't work with async code.
[09:59:31] <Voyage> systemfault,  async : is false
[09:59:44] <systemfault> Ah...
[09:59:46] <systemfault> lol
[09:59:52] <systemfault> Good luck :)
[09:59:55] <Voyage> sorry?
[10:00:58] <systemfault> I don't do sync XHR... Not even sure how... and in any case, it's bad and I won't encourage it.
[10:12:20] <ravenzz> maybe someone can help me with a couple of sentences in english?! "a library for making xhr requests" or "to make"?
[10:12:58] <systemfault> ravenzz: Ask the #English guys, they're really helpful
[10:13:40] <ravenzz> hehe I know, however I am afraid they might not know what an xhr is
[10:14:40] <ravenzz> I'll give it a try
[10:16:33] <Thoams> A utility library to facilitate the execution of xhr requests.
[10:17:01] * Thoams wins.
[10:17:53] <ravenzz> oh well that sounds a bit odd
[10:18:06] <Thoams> It's concise?
[10:18:11] <ravenzz> it is
[10:18:27] <Thoams> AjaxLib.
[10:18:40] <Thoams> :)
[10:18:49] <ravenzz> execution sounds odd in this contest
[10:18:52] <Thoams> x
[10:19:09] <ravenzz> x*
[10:19:11] <Thoams> well, you're not cuddling them
[10:19:15] <Thoams> and you're not halting them
[10:19:21] <Thoams> you're pretty much executing them
[10:19:21] <ravenzz> I am making them
[10:19:28] <Thoams> weeeell
[10:19:29] <Voyage> systemfault,   http://jsfiddle.net/7JETU/11/   better?  one question that I was unable to do. how to get the html data of that link ?
[10:19:30] <Thoams> granted
[10:19:54] <Thoams> but you'd presumably like to advertise the fact that you're doing more than just generating requests
[10:20:05] <Thoams> hopefully you're also doing something with the potential responses
[10:20:13] <ravenzz> correct
[10:20:14] <Thoams> the whole process being execution
[10:20:27] <Thoams> generation, transmission, response handling
[10:20:49] <Thoams> best of luck though
[10:21:02] <Thoams> nomenclature is a word which sort of means how we name words.
[10:21:05] <systemfault> Voyage: What's wrong?
[10:21:05] <Thoams> or... something.
[10:21:40] <systemfault> Voyage: I suggest you use the "data" param of the $.ajax instead of adding them yourself to the URL
[10:21:51] <ravenzz> Thoams you're right mate, but my question was more grammar related than anything else
[10:22:09] <systemfault> Beside that, it's fine... you will only get an error on the jsfiddle because of the cross-domain origin policy
[10:24:26] <systemfault> Voyage: Bonjour?
[10:25:01] <Voyage> systemfault,  here http://jsfiddle.net/7JETU/15/
[10:26:32] <systemfault> Voyage: Do you understand you'll never be able to load the HTML from a domain that is different than the one you're on?
[10:26:49] <systemfault> (Unless the target website has CORS enabled at the server level)
[10:27:52] <systemfault> Voyage: Also, you need to prevent the default when you click on the link
[10:28:08] <systemfault> Or else, clicking on the link will change the page
[10:29:45] <jop008> Is there a way to extend the length of an autocomplete field?
[10:31:20] <Voyage> systemfault,  hm. I tried in my local server too. http://jsfiddle.net/7JETU/17/
[10:31:30] <Voyage> systemfault,  took care of prevent
[10:32:52] <systemfault> Voyage: It's working now?
[10:35:52] <Voyage> thanks. i got it working
[10:39:44] <systemfault> Voyage: You could make it a bit nicer by 1) using the "data" config option instead of adding params to the url 2) using the promise-based interface to make it more flexible.
[10:46:19] <Voyage> k
[10:47:39] <kidem_> n00b question so say i have a PHP file that you would enter data into - and you want jquery to validate the data and to collect all the data in a form, and give field names nice names , any got an example of this?
[10:48:03] <DobreJoe> jquery form validation plugins
[10:48:24] <DobreJoe> those are filled with examples of just that
[10:50:10] <kidem_> nice thx
[12:40:41] <Hyperking> anyone here use gulp or grunt
[12:42:51] <Hyperking> hello
[12:43:31] <ManyouRisms> just ask...
[12:44:16] <Hyperking> can gulp or grunt tasks run from a local folder without nodemodules being installed locally?
[14:13:32] <AstonJ> Hi All... I was just wondering for tips on achieving the following... I want to add a #hashtag system for users posting on my for admin-set keywords (provided in JSON format - the keyword and a URL) and I'd like to use JS to provide suggestions as they type (perhaps something like jQuery UI autocomplete?). So while typing #ho we show 'Honda' as a suggestion, and when clicked, it inserts the BBCODE for a link to the Honda page on our site. Any ideas or tips on 
[14:13:32] <AstonJ> best to achieve this please? Thanks in advance.

[15:04:13] <adamsilver> I have FIELD1 in ($this): http://bpaste.net/show/k6i85gHBSA8kW72d2O2o/ .. I want to get FIELD2… this is not getting it for me: $(this).closest(("select[name*='FIELD2']") .. why?
[15:14:16] <ajpiano>  adamsilver: closest is not just "magically find the closest thing", it searches the element itself and its ancestors
[15:15:09] <adamsilver> ajpiano: I tried: $(this).parent().parent().closest and it didn't work either
[15:15:32] <ajpiano> not sure what you really mean when you say you "have FIELD1 in $(this)"
[15:15:55] <ajpiano> FIELD1 is a string that is found in a bunch of attributes, but is not itself unique to a particular element
[15:16:45] <ajpiano> do you mean that
[15:16:59] <ajpiano> this === select#id_form-0-FIELD1
[15:16:59] <ajpiano> ?
[15:17:11] <ajpiano> if so, then what you need is
[15:17:25] <ajpiano> $(this).closest(".form-group").next()
[15:18:29] <ajpiano> and if you want to find the select within that, then .find("select") off that
[15:18:29] <ajpiano> etc
[15:21:09] <adamsilver> ajpiano: ok thanks i am trying this now
[16:15:07] <axilaris> hi... is there a way to trigger to make a selection on select dropdown ?
[16:15:35] <axilaris> just like we set a value on text input like this $('#product_name').val('Product B');
[16:22:50] <ManyouRisms> $("#box").append('option', { "text" : $("input[name=otherSize]").text(), "value" :  $("input[name=otherSize]").text() })
[16:23:10] <v0id3d> I am working on making a jquery plugin/library and I want to use the append feature so I can append to the actual element but $(this).append("<h1>Test</h1>");
[16:23:49] <bengalo> axilaris you can read and set with val() too
[16:24:18] <v0id3d> i am am attempting to have it called like ("#test").pluginname();
[16:24:20] <axilaris> bengalo: ManyouRisms: thanks... actually i tried setting val() didnt work...
[16:24:32] <axilaris> let me try ManyouRisms suggestion
[16:27:00] <ManyouRisms> oh i think it should be value actually, it still pretends to add and gives no error, but then nothing is added to the seleciton box
[16:27:01] <ManyouRisms> grr
[16:27:07] <ManyouRisms> .val() rather
[16:28:49] <axilaris> tried the .val didnt work
[16:28:49] <axilaris> https://gist.github.com/axilaris/9591377
[16:28:57] <axilaris> using coffeescript
[16:29:02] <axilaris> and converting into js
[16:31:33] <bengalo> well, val does work ;)
[16:32:13] <axilaris> maybe there needs to be .trigger
[16:32:16] <axilaris> saw some where
[16:32:20] <axilaris> bengalo: really
[16:34:31] <bengalo> this is not comfortable to look at at all
[16:37:06] <bengalo> trying to find a site that does the formatting itself but couldnt come up with one :/
[16:37:21] <axilaris> u r right
[16:37:22] <axilaris> it works
[16:37:29] <axilaris> i tried on another select box
[16:37:34] <axilaris> probably the id is not right
[16:38:01] <bengalo> why are you using all those returns?
[16:38:19] <axilaris> i dont know...coffeescript generates it
[16:38:25] <axilaris> not on purpose
[16:38:38] <axilaris> i thought of trying coffeescript to make it neater...
[16:39:17] <axilaris> .val might not work on select2 box
[16:39:29] <davearel> Coffeescript, like ruby, returns the last line of any function
[16:39:57] <axilaris> then its not an issue then
[16:40:11] <davearel> It won't hurt anything
[16:40:15] <axilaris> yup
[16:41:14] <bengalo> btw var varname = value
[16:41:16] <bengalo> 1 line
[16:43:06] <axilaris> ?
[16:44:04] <bengalo> nohting serious, just leave what u have
[16:44:23] <axilaris> ok .val doesnt work on select2
[16:44:38] <axilaris> have to figure out how to explicitly trigger a select2 option
[16:45:19] <axilaris> let me try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13987379/change-select2-option-on-click
[16:46:34] <bengalo> i dont even know selct2
[16:46:35] <bengalo> but
[16:46:40] <bengalo> from
[16:46:41] <bengalo> http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#documentation
[16:46:49] <bengalo> Gets or sets the selection. If the value parameter is not specified, the id attribute of the currently selected element is returned. If the value parameter is specified it will become the current selection.
[16:48:33] <axilaris> yup that worked
[16:48:40] <bengalo> reading the doc helps ;)
[16:48:48] <axilaris> so thats the way to do it :) $("#e8").select2("val", "CA");
[16:48:55] <bengalo> correct
[16:49:06] <axilaris> cheers mate!
[16:49:15] <bengalo> keep the link
[16:49:17] <bengalo> you will need it
[16:49:19] <axilaris> haha
[16:49:20] <bengalo> :>
[17:00:58] <bfrederi> I have some javascript that I want to run on all different mobile browsers, but "new Date()" returns inconsistent values across all mobile phones. How can I get them all in sync with a certain time?
[17:01:19] <__joshua__> mahahahaha
[17:01:19] <bfrederi> (down to the second)
[17:01:24] <__joshua__> sorry, but good luck
[17:01:33] <__joshua__> the browser can tell you what ever time it feels like
[17:02:00] <__joshua__> if you dont care about time zones etc then it should be relatively straight foward
[17:02:06] <__joshua__> you probably want a utc epoch
[17:02:13] <__joshua__> which is an integer
[17:02:42] <__joshua__> or use this shim https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString
[17:05:39] <bfrederi> __joshua__, How would I get a standard time? I already tried doing a current time fetch from an ajax endpoint on my server, where I would set the current time based on what my server said.
[17:06:11] <bfrederi> But that didn't seem to work for some reason.
[17:06:29] <__joshua__> by standard, to you mean in a standard format, or in a standard timezone?
[17:07:19] <bfrederi> __joshua__: sorry, I meant just the same time (all the devices will be on the same timezone)
[17:07:36] <bfrederi> __joshua__: to the second
[17:07:49] <bfrederi> __joshua__: utc would be fine
[17:08:14] <bfrederi> __joshua__: but the exact second has to be consistent across all mobile browsers
[17:08:28] <__joshua__> you could make it around a second
[17:08:45] <__joshua__> ok, you could pass utc to the client, who uses compares it with their time.
[17:09:23] <__joshua__> you just have to keep track of the difference between server time and client time
[17:09:45] <__joshua__> like var time_offset = server_utc - client_utc;
[17:10:08] <__joshua__> current time = new Date().getUTC() - time_offset.... that kinda thing
[17:11:19] <bfrederi> __joshua__: Good idea. I need to see why the current_time was off, even though I was setting the time to the exact server time's current time...
[17:11:56] <__joshua__> but, the time in the client will lag by the latency of the connection to the server, and will depending on where/on what stage of page load you set the offset
[17:13:17] <v0id3d> I am working on making a jquery plugin/library and I want to use the append feature so I can append to the actual element but $(this).append("<h1>Test</h1>");
[17:13:20] <v0id3d> i am am attempting to have it called like ("#test").pluginname();
[17:13:50] <bfrederi> __joshua__: I'm fine with even a second of lag. But this was like several seconds off for some reason...
[17:14:14] <bfrederi> __joshua__: I must have done something wrong...
[17:14:25] <__joshua__> look at your network time line (if using ff or chrome).  when does your js execute?  on dom ready?  onload?
[17:14:46] <__joshua__> v0id3d: like appendTo?
[17:15:03] <v0id3d> yea like i want it to append to the element that it is calling it
[17:15:17] <v0id3d> $('#test')
[17:15:27] <__joshua__> like appendTo?
[17:15:34] <v0id3d> if i replace the $(this). to ('#test") it works
[17:15:41] <bfrederi> Yeah, on dom read. But I also use a .setInterval function that constantly pulls the current time from the server on every second
[17:15:52] <__joshua__> https://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[17:15:56] <v0id3d> ty
[17:16:37] <__joshua__> and how long is the round trip for that poll?
[17:18:42] <bfrederi> __joshua__: not sure
[17:19:01] <__joshua__> you can see in the network graph if using chrome or ff
[17:19:44] <tavp> Hey guys, someone there?
[17:20:01] <__joshua__> hi
[17:20:18] <v0id3d> it says append and appendTo are the same
[17:20:52] <bfrederi> __joshua__: Thanks! I'll check it out.
[17:21:13] <__joshua__> v0id3d: they are opposites
[17:21:13] <bfrederi> Need to fix up my code again for doing the $.get... :-/
[17:22:04] <v0id3d> so if I say ("this text").appendTo.($this) it should work?
[17:22:22] <tavp> Any one got an idea on why I get the error msg "has no method 'pareseJSON'? (Im using JQuery 2.0.2 and it is referenced via link http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.2.js)
[17:22:34] <__joshua__> pareseJSON is a typo
[17:23:29] <tavp>   var jsonp = '{"Lang":"jQuery","ID":"1"}';
[17:23:30] <tavp>   var obj = $.parseJSON(jsonp); it gives me the error
[17:24:31] <__joshua__> tavp: really old browser?
[17:25:17] <tavp> chrome
[17:25:22] <tavp> 33.0
[17:25:33] <__joshua__> and what (exact) error are you getting?
[17:26:04] <__joshua__> im assuming  "has no method 'pareseJSON' is your typo?
[17:26:14] <systemfault> In jQuery 2.x... parseJSON directly uses JSON.parse..
[17:26:24] <__joshua__> yeah, so it should just work
[17:26:25] <systemfault> So, it's your code that is messed up
[17:26:33] <tavp> I'll try it now
[17:26:35] <tavp> 1sec
[17:29:10] <tavp> it worked joshua
[17:29:14] <tavp> thanks bro!
[17:47:47] <iampamza> Looking for JSON parse errors? what's it all about? So here's a sample: http://69.171.235.16/ It's a JSON error, Would love to know what's with JSON exploitation and if anything could be done such as 'JSON' injection. I heard Jquery is vulnerable as well if properly not implemented. Rest is Ruby on Rails over PHP etc..
[17:48:54] <systemfault> Do you understand that code?
[17:48:58] <systemfault> And why it's there?
[17:49:18] <iampamza> systemfault: Why is it there?
[17:49:45] <systemfault> iampamza: So that json is impossible to load with a <script> tag
[17:50:04] <systemfault> Loading it with a <script> tag would crash the browser
[17:50:31] <iampamza> systemfault: So it is not exploitable?
[17:50:36] <systemfault> Not really
[17:50:49] <systemfault> Don't take my word for it though, I'm not a security expert.
[17:51:23] <systemfault> So... you have that loop to avoid leaking data via <script> tags.... and for normal XHR, you have the crossdomain policy
[17:52:17] <iampamza> yes, JSON that you serve over HTTP should not be valid JavaScript
[17:52:27] <iampamza> however, trying to load invalid JavaScript in a <script> tag should not "crash the browser"
[17:52:36] <iampamza> or are you using a pretty poor browser
[17:53:34] <__joshua__> yeah, an object literal with no expression is not valid js
[17:53:40] <__joshua__> no json isn't valid by itself
[17:53:44] <__joshua__> so*
[17:54:32] <systemfault> iampamza: You're new to JS?
[17:54:43] <systemfault> iampamza: Try running an infinite loop for fun
[17:54:55] <systemfault> You will at least crash that tab
[17:55:14] <iampamza> by the way, it doesn't need to be a "loop"
[17:55:21] <iampamza> when i dealt with this problem in the past, i just prefaced the JSON with a ] [08:54] <Cathy> which is sufficient to make it invalid JavaScript
[17:55:37] <__joshua__> if you have chrome dev tools open, you will crash occasionally, though (i do)
[17:55:59] <iampamza> So it is not vulnerable?
[17:56:23] <systemfault> Anyway.... facebook and google both use that kind of "guard" on their json payloads.
[17:56:59] <iampamza> JSON injection
[19:49:42] <v0id3d> when you make a plugin $(this) is the name of the plug in rite?
[20:23:40] <Jonno_FTW> hi
[20:23:50] <Europa88_> Hi there
[20:24:03] <Jonno_FTW> I have a problem where a plugin I am using isn't loading
[20:24:36] <Jonno_FTW> I'm using sticktable headers, but I run $("table#localization_table").stickyTableHeaders(); and get TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'stickyTableHeaders'
[20:24:54] <Jonno_FTW> <script type='script/javascript' src="/js/jquery.stickytableheaders.min.js"></script> is loaded before the table is loaded
[20:25:26] <Jonno_FTW> using jquery 1.9.1
[20:26:52] <Velveeta> can you put together a demo, or post a link to where the error can be seen?
[20:27:09] <Jonno_FTW> it's a local site, but I'll see if I can replicate it
[20:32:35] <Velveeta> i would start by verifying that the url you're loading that script from is correct... the only reason that error should be occurring is if it's not loaded
[20:36:00] <Jonno_FTW> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/BAv2Q/
[20:36:13] <Velveeta> looking now
[20:36:18] <Jonno_FTW> ty
[20:37:06] <Velveeta> i'm not seeing an error in this page though, and let me restructure the way you've included that script
[20:37:15] <Velveeta> or rather i'm not seeing *your* error on this page
[20:40:36] <Jonno_FTW> Velveeta: on my local version I get no error either, but when I run the $("table").stickytableheaders() I get the error
[20:40:54] <Velveeta> are you executing it with that case?
[20:40:58] <Velveeta> or camel-cased
[20:41:03] <Jonno_FTW> no
[20:42:48] <Jonno_FTW> 4~how can I check if the plugin is loaded?
[20:43:04] <Velveeta> you can try to console.log($.fn.stickyTableHeaders)
[20:43:10] <Velveeta> and see if it outputs undefined or function
[20:43:27] <Jonno_FTW> it's not there
[20:43:38] <Velveeta> as in, it's undefined?
[20:43:48] <Jonno_FTW> correct
[20:43:57] <Velveeta> then yeah, it's not loaded at the time you're trying to call it
[20:44:00] <v0id3d> I am writting a plugin and when i attach $(this).append("Some text") the $(this) in the plugin is refering to the $(selector) in my actual js rite?
[20:44:36] <Velveeta> v0id3d: if you're writing your plugin function to live in the $.fn namespace, then yes
[20:44:40] <Jonno_FTW> maybe I need to use $(document).ready
[20:44:56] <v0id3d> because it is not working rite
[20:45:25] <Velveeta> jonno_ftw: that's always a wise choice, but provided you've loaded it in a script tag, those block execution until they've loaded, so their contents should be available anytime after their tag has been passed in the dom
[20:45:34] <v0id3d> if i post it in a fiddle can you take a look at it for me?
[20:45:37] <Velveeta> that's why i said i'd start by verifying the address you're loading it from is correct
[20:45:52] <Jonno_FTW> Velveeta: it comes up in the network tab as loaded
[20:45:56] <Velveeta> v0id3d: i can take a quick look, yes, but i'll be on my way to bed in the next couple minutes, so you'll need to be fast
[20:46:14] <Velveeta> jonno_ftw: and if you examine the contents of what got loaded, those contents are valid?
[20:46:25] <Velveeta> it's not loading like a custom 404 error page or something right?
[20:46:36] <v0id3d> http://jsfiddle.net/gQd23/
[20:46:46] <v0id3d> thats the plugin
[20:47:22] <v0id3d> and i am calling it like $("#state").qzSQLComboLoad();
[20:48:04] <v0id3d> if i change the bottom $(this) to $("#state").append(blabla) it works fine
[20:49:05] <Velveeta> v0id3d: when you write a plugin function, 'this' is the element, in the top-level scope
[20:49:23] <Velveeta> but within that scope, you're calling another function, which is resetting 'this' to a different scope within its own callback
[20:50:15] <v0id3d> so how would i achive what i am looking for?
[20:50:27] <v0id3d> i guess its the function for success rite
[20:50:46] <Velveeta> you should do some quick reading up about how javascript function scoping works, but in the meantime, the quick answer to your problem can be seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/gQd23/1/ note the $.proxy wrapper on your success callback
[20:51:02] <Velveeta> that will bind the scope of the current element in that loop, to be passed in as the scope of the callback function for your ajax request
[20:51:51] <Velveeta> another tip for you, executing ajax requests in loops like that is bad practice.. also, passing anonymous functions in loops, you should create the function once, outside the loop, and then pass it by reference inside the loop
[20:52:04] <Velveeta> like function foo () {}, and then $.each(blah, foo)
[20:52:24] <v0id3d> ok
[20:52:31] <Velveeta> or rather, $.each(blah, function () { $.ajax{{success: foo}) })
[20:52:31] <v0id3d> this is first run at trying something
[20:52:43] <Velveeta> right, that's fine, i'm just throwing that info out there as best practice knowledge
[20:52:46] <v0id3d> so i should read up $.each
[20:53:11] <v0id3d> I had a feeling that I needed to do something like that
[20:53:22] <Velveeta> you should read up on function scoping first, and learn how javascript defines the scope of its functions (the 'this' reference) as well as how to define it yourself when you invoke a function manually
[20:53:40] <Velveeta> and then read up on $.proxy towards that end
[20:53:42] <v0id3d> ok thanks
[20:53:46] <Velveeta> no problemo, good luck
[21:02:01] <nights> hi guys
[21:02:14] <nights> how can i send two fields as if they were part of a form by a single ajax query?
[21:02:28] <nights> ive experimented with processData: false,
[21:02:28] <nights>                 contentType: 'multipart/form-data',
[21:02:40] <nights> but havnt been able to get it working
[21:06:49] <MrSavage> I'm trying to: console.log($("first_last")); and I have prevObject containing what I want inside that
[21:07:05] <MrSavage> But when I do console.log($("first_last")[0]); I get undefined
[21:07:08] <MrSavage> what is up with that?
[21:16:41] <Hilton> Why would an AJAX request that returns 200 OK (and JSON response data) be triggering the error function in $.ajax() ? All my other calls - dozens of them - work perfectly fine using the exact same save function, but this one gives an error box instead of showing saved, even though the data is saved and the response even indicates it.
[21:18:50] <nights> Hilton: code pls
[21:19:00] <Hilton> Actually I just realized the problem.
[21:19:06] <nights> ok
[21:19:11] <nights> bet it was easy to figure out
[21:19:12] <Hilton> Somehow a <br> was being output before the JSON data.
[21:19:17] <Hilton> Didn't notice it.
[21:19:19] <nights> yeah
[21:19:31] <nights> before i switched to a better editor
[21:19:42] <nights> i had a invisible 0-space character in my editor
[21:19:51] <Hilton> Still seems odd that it triggered an error - other ajax calls that don't return JSON (and return straight HTML) work just fine...,
[21:20:45] <nights> hm
[21:20:56] <nights> well thats because they are just html?
[21:21:08] <nights> was dataType: 'json', even on?
[21:21:38] <Hilton> No
[21:22:49] <nights> hm
[21:23:00] <nights> you need that
[21:23:16] <nights> didnt know you could even process json in the response without it
[21:23:38] <Hilton> First line of my success function is:                     $.each(result, function (k, v) {
[21:23:46] <Hilton> Seems to work.
[21:23:56] <nights> hm
[21:24:04] <nights> you do that on the raw response?
[21:24:12] <Hilton> Yeah.
[21:24:29] <nights> better tuck in that array as on of the response parameters
[21:24:38] <nights> *one
[21:24:47] <Hilton> Maybe that's where the error was being triggered, when $.each encountered non-JSON data. Now that I think about it, this function relies on JSON - the raw HTML calls are elsewhere.
[21:24:56] <nights> yeah
[21:25:04] <Hilton> ?
[21:25:06] <nights> but dataType: 'json', in your ajax call
[21:25:10] <nights> and see if it works
[21:26:01] <Hilton> No effect, everything still works. (I already corrected the initial bug, it was in PHP)
[21:26:54] <nights> ok then its probably right
[21:27:03] <nights> but to be safe always use that dataType param
[21:27:07] <nights> for your json calls
[21:27:21] <nights> not sure what happens without it
[21:27:40] <nights> might work, but bet you will run into problems
[21:28:00] <Hilton> nights: I'm sure this code is thoroughly scary: http://pastebin.com/HAGHjzth
[21:28:39] <Hilton> And riddled with mistakes.
[21:29:04] <nights> hm
[21:29:10] <nights> that each block doesnt look right
[21:29:26] <nights> have you looked at serialize?
[21:30:17] <nights> For jQuery Ajax Form Submit, we can use jQuery.ajax()  or jQuery.post() method. To serialize form data, we can use jQuery.serialize() or jQuery.serializeArray().
[21:30:22] <nights> look at these
[21:30:55] <Hilton> Oh, the FIRST $.each
[21:31:25] <nights> yeah
[21:32:23] <Hilton> Hmm. That will require changes to my server side code. Right now it expects key-value pairs - data ID => value
[21:32:50] <nights> yeah
[21:32:51] <nights> i hear you
[21:32:54] <nights> you might want to conform
[21:32:57] <nights> things will get easier
[21:33:03] <nights> its up to you when
[21:33:05] <nights> :)
[21:33:33] <nights> if you are in it long term, just shape things up will do a lot of good
[21:33:34] <Hilton> A submission right now is -- http://kcs.local/userAjax/update?user-26-first_name=Test&user-26-last_name=Account&_=1395030761963
[21:33:45] <nights> that code you showed me looked fragile
[21:33:57] <Hilton> Could be one or twenty key-value pairs.
[21:33:59] <nights> so you might spend a lot of time repairing that while like serialize() is simple
[21:35:46] <Hilton> It's a pretty simple loop. It would just be a quick data collection - $.each(elemI, function (k, i) { fieldData[inp.prop('name')] = inp.val(); }); except for having to test for checkboxes.
[21:36:42] * Hilton tests what serialize() does with checkboxes...
[21:37:22] <nights> yeah
[21:37:39] <nights> but then you will have other html form components in the future
[21:37:47] <nights> and having to deal with them on that level is a pain
[21:37:54] <nights> when you dont need to do anything more than serialize
[21:38:32] <nights> i have some hacks like that too, but spent some time to get rid of most of them recently
[21:39:03] <Hilton> See that's the problem.
[21:39:38] <Hilton> I think I looked at serialize and couldn't use it because it skips checkboxes that aren't checked. I can't make that assumption - I have to know if it's checked or not, hence why my code sets "on" or NULL.
[21:40:56] <imjakechapman> Hey guys, I'm having some problems with require.js and not sure if anyone can help me figure this out... been reading through the require.js docs and still haven't found a solution... nothing on stackoverflow nothing...
[21:40:56] <imjakechapman> http://laravel.io/bin/4rY8
[21:42:03] <Hilton> "Values from checkboxes and radio buttons (inputs of type "radio" or "checkbox") are included only if they are checked." No good.
[21:42:44] <nights> hilton, why do you need non checked fields?
[21:42:51] <nights> in php just do
[21:43:02] <nights> isset( $_POST['mycheckbox'] )
[21:43:07] <nights> if its not there, its not checked
[21:43:14] <nights> thats all you need, and its the standard way of doing it
[21:50:32] <Hilton> nights: Because this is not a standard form. It's a type of in-place editing. Nothing is being done a "standard way" because it's not a standard presentation. Only values which are presented are changed - everything else is untouched.
[21:55:25] <nights> Hilton: yeah, but dont you see that the logic will be the same?
[21:55:42] <nights> unless you are doing something like
[21:56:11] <nights> $db_row->{$_POST['checkbox_name']} = $_POST['checkbox_value']
[22:01:04] <Hilton> nights: That's roughly it, with a few more checks and balances. There are hundreds of editable values across a dozen pages, each of which can be editing any of hundreds of records. To tie it all together, simplify code and maintenance, and keep everything functioning the same, there is a single set of JS functions which handle add/delete/edit/save. On the PHP side is a single Update function...
[22:01:05] <Hilton> ...which handles all the incoming data - it does look for *known* value keys (and do extra validation where the AR model validation isn't sufficient), but makes no assumptions that those are actually being submitted unless the data is found. To do otherwise would mean a few dozen update functions all doing roughly the same thing and all having to be maintained in parallel.
[22:02:14] <Hilton> There are thorough and sometimes repeated checks that the data is coming from a logged in user, and one that has appropriate permission to edit the area they are trying to submit. So even if someone figures out the system and tries to submit data to something they can't control, it will be rejected.
[23:18:31] <MrSavage> What's a function that lets me obtain all the HTML of a URL in DOM format?
[23:18:55] <mitchdotpro> Hey guys -- just been checking out this site in Chrome -- any ideas how they might be detecting the scroll down/up to scroll between sections? http://www.oregongridiron.com/#!/
[23:27:30] <Hilton> mitchdotpro: Not sure if it's what you're after, but check out superscrollorama, it can do a LOT of things.
[23:27:40] <Hilton> http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[23:27:52] <mitchdotpro> Hilton: Looking - thanks! :-)
[23:29:47] <mitchdotpro> Hilton: It might be right, will require more delving. Thanks.
[23:30:02] <mitchdotpro> Now if I can just remember the name of that jQuery plguin that had a ton of parallax functionality in built
[23:39:38] <nights> Hilton: ok, i see... well then, you might need some custom validation :)
[23:39:52] <nights> i always run into those situations
[23:40:00] <Hilton> Yeah.
[23:40:08] <Hilton> (amazingly, I'm still here!)
[23:40:42] <Hilton> This was the best I could come up with for the scenario without creating tons of extra work.
[23:40:48] <Hilton> I've done my best on security checks though.
[23:40:56] <nights> hm good
[23:40:58] <nights> but
[23:41:04] <nights> why not do the same thing on server
[23:41:13] <nights> if you have an AR model you know the fields in the db
[23:41:23] <nights> foreach them and if the POSt var is isset
[23:41:24] <nights> set it
[23:41:48] <nights> well if you have tons of fields that might even be slopw
[23:42:11] <nights> but not sure if sending hundreds of empty checkbox values over http is much better
[23:42:33] <nights> (surprisingly im still here , too!)
[23:57:46] <Hilton> Most submissions, as I said before, are 1-20 fields.
[23:58:33] <Hilton> foreaches for each possible submission would mean tons of different update functions to accommodate them all, plus lots of manual updating to handle new fields.
