[00:00:03] <lijzz> but i need the images to come from XML
[00:00:12] <seancurtis> lijzz: load the images onto the page and then animate them with jQuery - you could even use css animations for that
[00:00:36] <new2jq> i m new to jquery and unable to run templete...!!
[00:00:50] <seancurtis> lijzz: you could probably do an ajax call for them - sounds like you need to hire a frontend developer :)
[00:00:52] <lijzz> do you have any examples
[00:01:06] <seancurtis> not off the top of my head - I'd just go googling
[00:06:00] <lijzz> nops
[00:07:05] <lijzz>  does some body have any control to display images? i want to display images from xml file 3 at a time with navigate buttons. the first and 3rd should be dim
[00:07:27] <lijzz> go go
[00:07:33] <lijzz> come come
[00:11:28] <darthness> hi everybody
[00:13:49] <djQuery> Whirl3d: you know you can do var x = 1, y=2 ect... you dont have to do a new var for each one right?
[00:14:35] <larzen> ok I have two objects --- and I wanted to compare them both...
[00:14:54] <larzen> they are are actually clones of each other initially, then one changes slightly depending on user input. Any ideas/
[00:14:56] <durre> I have a subnavigation bar that opens on click. I want it to close again if someone clicks outside it. is there a more efficient way than attaching a click event to the body and closing the menu there?
[00:15:42] <djQuery> ?clickoutside
[00:15:44] <bot-t1> djQuery, clickoutside | jQuery Plugins - On click outside of an element executes a callback. It can be attached to multiple elements. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/click-outside
[00:15:52] <djQuery> durre: ^^
[00:16:23] <djQuery> not the one I was looking for but
[00:18:42] <jomofcw> Hello !
[00:19:20] <asadpakistani1> How can i execute a callback in the parent window from a jquery ui dialog iframe passing it some variables upon closing?
[00:23:16] <djQuery> asadpakistani1: window.top?
[00:24:37] <anli_> If I use foo.click(function(event) {}); can I always rely on event.target to exist?
[00:24:50] <asadpakistani1> djQuery: just my object in like window.top.MyObject?
[00:25:02] <djQuery> anli_: if you pass in the event yes
[00:25:27] <djQuery> asadpakistani1: it has been a long time since I needed to do it having to look it up again
[00:25:51] <Cork> anli_: yes you can, jquery fakes .target for browsers that doesn't support it
[00:26:54] <djQuery> asadpakistani1: think its parent.functionname()
[00:27:04] <djQuery> there is also parent.document
[00:27:12] <anli_> Cork: Thats cool, event is also a jquery object, is it?
[00:27:23] <Cork> anli_: no its an event object
[00:27:30] <anli_> ah, ok
[00:27:35] <anli_> thx Cork!
[00:27:37] <Cork> but jquery extends it
[00:27:41] <Cork> np
[00:28:01] <anli_> Hm, if you declare the event handler using html instead of script, jquery will not intervene, I suppose?
[00:28:20] <Cork> anli_: you will have the dom native event object ya
[00:28:45] <Cork> anli_: but you should never use inline events anyway
[00:28:54] <anli_> Cork: why not?
[00:29:08] <anli_> Seems to be the simpliest way of declaring an event handler
[00:29:19] <djQuery> anli_: seperation of html and code
[00:29:28] <Cork> anli_: it makes the code hard to mainain
[00:29:33] <Cork> *maintain
[00:29:45] <anli_> Hm, does it
[00:30:02] <djQuery> not to mention those inline events can be hard to debug
[00:30:03] <anli_> Its a lot easier to spot the existence of the event if you declare it inline
[00:30:13] <Cork> yes, if you scatter the event bindings all over the html, you will have to hunt for it and make sure you find them all
[00:30:32] <Cork> while if you bind it all in one place you know where it is
[00:31:10] <anli_> all stuff happends in one place is not my recipe for easy code maintainability
[00:31:12] <anli_> happens
[00:31:17] <Cork> anli_: and in modern browsers you get performans penelties too
[00:31:22] <djQuery> anli_: I personaly work hard to try to do stuff the same on every page so that I can reuse my script no matter what. I dont need to handle it in each individual element. I know if I put an element of x type it is gonnna perform y
[00:31:26] <anli_> I never consider performance
[00:31:31] <Cork> heh
[00:31:35] <anli_> I never need to :)
[00:31:43] <Cork> i goess you never write js heavy pages
[00:31:50] <anli_> reusing is not that good
[00:31:56] <anli_> Its good, but not as good as ppl think
[00:32:00] <anli_> I do
[00:32:10] <anli_> But I try to stay away from having them heavy :)
[00:32:28] <djQuery> <input type="email" required multiple />
[00:32:34] <anli_> I rather split them in many pages, will make it easier for the user as well
[00:32:48] <anli_> djQuery: I agree thats good
[00:32:59] <anli_> djQuery: you meant class, I suppose
[00:33:08] <djQuery> nope thats valid html5
[00:33:15] <Cork> anli_: my current project is built with over 20000 lines of code, and most of the html is js generated
[00:33:16] <anli_> <input type="email" class="required multiple">
[00:33:24] <Cork> inline events would kill it in a min
[00:33:33] <anli_> Aha
[00:33:40] <anli_> djQuery: but how beautiful is it
[00:34:01] <djQuery> anli_: what do you mean how buetiful is it?
[00:34:05] <Cork> djQuery: not really / isn't valid html5
[00:34:06] <anli_> talking about performance, its faster to find elements belonging to a certain class
[00:34:20] <Cork> djQuery: thats xhtml and not html
[00:34:55] <Cork> <input type="email" required multiple> if you want html5 or <input type="email" required="required" multiple="multiple" /> if you want xhtml5
[00:35:14] <anli_> I thought invented properties should be named data-required and data-multiple
[00:35:17] <djQuery> Cork: ok dont need the /> closing in html 5
[00:35:33] <Cork> djQuery: your actaully not allowed if it is to be valid
[00:35:35] <djQuery> anli_: copied from the html site <input type=email multiple name=cc>
[00:35:42] <Cork> anli_: those arn't invented
[00:35:43] <djQuery> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-multiple-attribute
[00:35:50] <anli_> cork: oh
[00:35:57] <Cork> anli_: those are speced attributes
[00:35:59] <anli_> ok
[00:36:29] <anli_> So required will not let the <form> element submit the form if the element contains an empty string?
[00:36:45] <djQuery> anli_: the great thing is if they have a newer browser I dont even need to test it client side
[00:37:07] <anli_> hm, ok
[00:37:44] <anli_> The required attribute is associated with the <form> tag which I never use
[00:37:49] <anli_> I do it all ajax
[00:37:51] <djQuery> anli_: If I mark it as an email type chrome\firefox\safari wont let them type in something that is not an email address
[00:38:00] <Cork> djQuery: but as you have to validate it for older clients, its not very usefull yet
[00:38:01] <anli_> aha
[00:38:05] <anli_> thats cool
[00:38:22] <djQuery> anli_: why cant I use a form tag and still do it ajax?
[00:38:28] <djQuery> ?malsup form
[00:38:32] <bot-t1> djQuery, 1 - Search Results – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/search?ticket=on&changeset=on&wiki=on&q=malsup&page=1&noquickjump=1
[00:38:45] <anli_> True, but you can get rid of the <form> tag using ajax
[00:38:53] <asadpakistani1> djQuery: thanks
[00:38:54] <djQuery> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[00:38:55] <anli_> And <form> tags is not that nice, I think
[00:39:24] <anli_> I was happy when I found that jquery saved me from them
[00:39:47] <djQuery> anli_: sure it is a nice way of telling your css and javascript that you have a group of elements that need to be formated\handled a certain way.
[00:40:01] <anli_> I put such elements in a <div> instead
[00:40:11] <anli_> divs are a logical divider anyway
[00:40:18] <anli_> are logical dividers
[00:40:37] <djQuery> anli_: yes but a form tag will help you logicaly group elements that need user interaction\population
[00:40:44] <rimantas> where is logic in divs?
[00:41:09] <anli_> Its a way to divide up things in logical units, I think
[00:41:16] <djQuery> hey javascript any time a form is submited do this. cant do that with a div
[00:41:18] <anli_> Things that belongs to each other
[00:41:27] <Cork> anli_: form is actually needed to some part
[00:41:37] <anli_> Cork: But I use ajax instead
[00:41:43] <anli_> $.post and  maybe $.get
[00:41:43] <Cork> anli_: ex, hitting enter in a field t submit doesn't work
[00:41:48] <Cork> if you don't have a <form> tag
[00:41:54] <Cork> t==to
[00:41:55] <anli_> I add the class autoenter to such fields
[00:42:07] <anli_> Then I write some code to make autoenter work
[00:42:18] <djQuery> and you know what my forms will still work if javascript is turned off
[00:42:22] <Cork> anli_: and the different form fill features doens't work
[00:42:24] <anli_> Then I can decide which <input>:s you can just press enter in
[00:42:46] <anli_> If javascript is turned off, I dont support the user with a webpage
[00:43:17] <djQuery> and some silly manager\designer decides they want an extra field and all goes to crap
[00:43:25] <dorigentoo> join #jquery-fr
[00:43:25] <anli_> Lets face it, its only in fairytales you find users that have turned off javascript
[00:43:40] <anli_> djQuery: You can still iterate <inputs>
[00:43:51] <anli_> Using  $('#div input').each
[00:43:57] <anli_> I collect form data that way
[00:44:05] <iszak> anli_, I have JS disabled all the time
[00:44:42] <anli_> The nicest thing about getting rid of <form> is that you can actually reload a page without getting asked if you want to post the form data one more time
[00:44:47] <iszak> why would I ever have it enabled? so people can track my mouse movement and clicking habits?! PSH
[00:44:57] <anli_> hehe
[00:45:07] <anli_> iszak: Mabe you are not one of my users :)
[00:45:18] <anli_> But people that turn off javascript are not that many
[00:45:29] <anli_> That hype is gone
[00:45:38] <anli_> It went away together with web safe colors
[00:45:53] <iszak> and as for your preposterous idea of removing a form element, why stop there? why not use JS to render HTML?
[00:45:58] <iszak> like ExtJS basically but more so
[00:46:08] <rimantas> Let me introduce MinHTML. Easy to learn: it has only few elements: html, link, script and div. <div class="header">There comes the header</div><div class="para">thre comes the text</div>
[00:46:09] <djQuery> iszak: anli_: I have it turned off as well.
[00:46:14] <iszak> and that way, when a non-JS (or search engine for that matter) the site just craps itself
[00:46:23] <anli_> djQuery, iszak: but you still use jquery?
[00:46:30] <iszak> yep
[00:46:33] <anli_> How is jquery running without javascript
[00:46:39] <iszak> NoScript
[00:46:41] <anli_> Its a javascript :)
[00:46:42] <rimantas> very fast
[00:46:48] <djQuery> if I like\trust a site I turn it on
[00:46:52] <iszak> djQuery, NoScript?
[00:47:01] <djQuery> y
[00:47:20] <anli_> I dont understand it, how can people turn off javascript, if you fear that people track your mouse movement, then stop being on the Internet :)
[00:47:23] <iszak> Plus by having JS disabled on most sites, you avoid all those crappy advertisements.
[00:47:28] <djQuery> hell half the time i am browsing in incognito mode anyway
[00:47:46] <anli_> I can send you a mail with all the mouse movements I have done today if you want
[00:47:49] <dorigentoo> hi guys
[00:48:06] <iszak> anli_, it's not so much about mouse movement and clicking, just that sites often abuse JS
[00:48:14] <anli_> I abuse it
[00:48:16] <anli_> ;)
[00:48:38] <anli_> Abuse in which way then?
[00:48:47] <iszak> Mostly advertisements, shit you don't want.
[00:48:57] <djQuery> anli_: get the book progressive enhancement and maybe have to do work where it has to work everywhere some time
[00:48:58] <dorigentoo> I have a div with opacity:0.5 and display:none. I do a $(".mydivclass").show("bounce") , by the opacity comes only once the bounce animation finished. I want to see the opacity during the animation, how can I fix that ?
[00:49:02] <anli_> But ads are flash
[00:49:15] <iszak> which are generally rendered by swfobject which is JS, no?
[00:49:27] <anli_> sure it is, but swfobject is not my greatest enemy
[00:49:49] <iszak> anli_, if a site needs JS (and I trust it) I will enable it, otherwise, NO JS FOR YOU
[00:49:53] <djQuery> anli_: its all the damn tracking scripts that I want to avoid
[00:49:55] <anli_> hehe
[00:50:11] <anli_> So you dont want ppl to track you?
[00:50:24] <anli_> I understand that actually
[00:50:35] <djQuery> if they want to know where I am going they can pay me
[00:50:41] <anli_> Do you have a facebook account?
[00:50:46] <djQuery> nopers
[00:50:49] <anli_> ok
[00:50:55] <iszak> god Facebook is evil
[00:51:06] <anli_> Which church do you both belong to? :)
[00:51:07] <iszak> all their data mining, it's ridiculous
[00:51:14] <iszak> I don't believe in religion.
[00:51:18] <anli_> Ah, that one
[00:51:49] <djQuery> the curch of dont screw with me and I wont screw with u
[00:51:53] <anli_> hehe
[00:52:00] <iszak> oh yeah I considered joining that one.
[00:52:13] <anli_> I am not afraid of people screwing with me, makes me feel comfortable with living
[00:52:19] <anli_> hehe
[00:52:28] <anli_> Let them screw and screw
[00:52:34] <anli_> screw them anyway
[00:52:37] <iszak> and makes it more justifiable when you screw them back, hard.
[00:52:42] <anli_> hehe
[00:53:10] <anli_> Do you also have surveillance cameras in your house?
[00:53:15] <iszak> no
[00:53:21] <djQuery> well I failed to grock jsviews
[00:53:25] <anli_> ok
[00:53:43] <djQuery> any got a client side templating framework that does databinding as well
[00:54:12] <djQuery> anli_: couple outside my house
[00:54:29] <iszak> how much did they cost djQuery ?
[00:54:30] <Whirl3d> if you create an unattached element stored in a variable ('holder') and use it to wrap another item, does your reference to the outer element remain in tact?
[00:54:43] <djQuery> last year a guy spent a little time in jail for being the third one to steal my car stereo
[00:54:44] <anli_> djQuery: ok
[00:55:03] * iszak thinks about using one of his 3 monitors to setup a surveillance system.
[00:55:05] <anli_> does he like music? :)
[00:55:21] <djQuery> iszak: more than the radio but less than the radio+window+dashboard etc..
[00:55:32] <iszak> are they 1080p?
[00:55:54] <iszak> and how long do you keep the videos for?
[00:56:46] <djQuery> they are low quality infrared wireless jobs
[00:57:07] <eirikb> Hey. I've been looking at some plugins for tables, such as tablesorter, datatable and flexgrid. What are your recommendations?
[00:57:15] <iszak> ExtJS
[00:57:39] <eirikb> I'm also going to be using jQuery UI
[00:57:53] <iszak> oh
[00:57:55] <djQuery> eirikb: if you wanna pay for it or you have an opensource project go with extjs if you want free open source go with see ?jqgrid
[00:57:57] <bot-t1> eirikb, jqGrid - Server Side Grid | jQuery Plugins - The grid is a Ajax-enabled JavaScript control that provides solution for representing tabular data on the web. Since the grid is client-side solution and loading data dynamically through Ajax callb... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqGrid
[00:58:05] <iszak> there was talk about jQuery Grids (for UI) not sure what's going on with that.
[00:58:28] <iszak> djQuery, ExtJS is awesome isn't it? :D
[00:58:55] <djQuery> eirikb: iszak: I have looked at thier demos but thier pricing models have driven me away from it.
[00:58:56] <eirikb> iszak: Yeah that is why I used Grids last time, but haven't seen anything more about it so looking around again
[00:59:22] <eirikb> djQuery: Thanks for the info
[00:59:28] <djQuery> eirikb: jqgrid is pretty active and a decent support forum
[00:59:34] <iszak> yeah
[01:00:25] <rogy> how to get all style information from a #id ?
[01:00:26] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/uxenub/24/edit
[01:00:41] <matter> Hey guys, I would like to do something simple I think : I have a list (ul li) and I would like just to navigate to the next li with a prev and next button
[01:00:46] <djQuery> anyone see anything I am doing wrong there.
[01:01:13] <djQuery> if your familar with templates its should be pretty obvious whats not working right
[01:01:25] <Cork> matter: $(this).next(); if this is your current li
[01:01:28] <djQuery> matter see ?.next
[01:01:29] <bot-t1> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[01:01:35] <eirikb> iszak: djQuery: Thanks for the info. I will look into jqGrid again then :) And since I'm already using UI and it is extending by UI I guess it makes sense
[01:01:54] <djQuery> eirikb: yeah its themable
[01:04:05] <matter> Cork, djQuery thanks, I am going to check this, I would like an horizontal list that where I click next the next li display and when I click prev, the previous li item display
[01:05:53] <djQuery> <ul><li> <span class="next">Next</span><span class="prev">Previous</span></li><li></li></ul>     $('ul').delegate('.next', 'click', fucntion(e){ $(this).closest('li').siblings('.active').removeClass('active').end().next().addClass('active');   })
[01:05:57] <matter> I think this will do it : http://jsfiddle.net/Rtmdj/10/
[01:06:03] <djQuery> matter: ^^^^^^
[01:08:31] <matter> djQuery, I prefer your solution
[01:09:14] <djQuery> matter that is putting the button in each li though
[01:10:23] <matter> I think I am on a good track, thanks djQuery
[01:11:43] <sean`> ola
[01:15:34] <SugaSlide> lol the UI demo page needs updating
[01:16:02] <djQuery> matter: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Rtmdj/11/
[01:17:34] <djQuery> matter: little change http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Rtmdj/12/   previous would be the same
[01:18:11] <clockwize> hey guys, i'm trying to preload an image, then when it's loaded, set it as the background of a div (which I have .hide()en) and then fadeIn('fast') but the image is just popping up, not fading in? http://pastebin.com/Wves0YGt
[01:19:31] <Whirl3d> clockwize, try using .animate instead of .fadeIn and .fadeOut. I hade the same problem and couldn't resolve it with .fadeIn and .fadeOut, so just animate opacity. It worked for me.
[01:19:43] <clockwize> ok, thanks
[01:20:17] <Whirl3d> Plus, in IE, you have to check for .complete because the load event never fires for cached images.
[01:20:32] <djQuery> clockwize: and think not using attr see ?.css
[01:20:33] <bot-t1> clockwize, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[01:21:05] <clockwize> Whirl3d: thanks, i'll bear that in mind :) What versions of IE does that affect?
[01:22:17] <djQuery> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fixing-load-in-ie-for-cached-images/
[01:22:27] <djQuery> clockwize: ^^^^^^^
[01:22:34] <Whirl3d> djQuery, you are my hero.
[01:22:40] <clockwize> thanks :)
[01:23:10] <djQuery> Whirl3d: funny google is mine

[01:24:11] <djQuery> SugaSlide: what wrong with it now?
[01:24:39] <anli_> Hm, I have two <input>:s with onchange, I also have a button with an onclick, if I change the text in one input and presses the button, the behaviour should be onchange-handler+onclick-handler, right?
[01:24:50] <Whirl3d> djQuery, here's the thing (before you go preaching how easy it is to find stuff on Google): There are 20 million results and at least 10 million of them provide out of date or conflicting information.
[01:25:06] <Whirl3d> The real value is in having someone who knows which result to trust
[01:25:09] <djQuery> Whirl3d: lol
[01:25:14] <Whirl3d> That's where you are needed and appreciated
[01:25:30] <Cork> anli_: yes onchange will trigger when you focus the button for the onclick
[01:26:11] * djQuery google f00 = 8
[01:26:13] <anli_> yes, but onclick never happened
[01:26:13] <SugaSlide> doesnt have all the new widgets in lol (the examples page when you download the package)
[01:26:26] <anli_> It only does if I click the button without changing an input
[01:26:40] <djQuery> SugaSlide: dont know of any that are missing. maybe .menu()
[01:26:45] <djQuery> whats missing?
[01:26:49] <Whirl3d> What would be nice is if there was a way for you to simple tag any sites you find with valid information. Then, when I google something, if it has djQuery's signature on it, I know it's golden.
[01:27:01] <SugaSlide> buttons buttonset :P
[01:27:03] <Whirl3d> ;)
[01:27:27] <djQuery> Whirl3d: there is its the +1 button
[01:27:38] <SugaSlide> isnt there also a tooltip thing added?
[01:27:44] <djQuery> SugaSlide: .button is there
[01:27:51] <djQuery> SugaSlide: not til 1.9
[01:28:17] <djQuery> stupid lazy bot

[01:31:28] <djQuery> Cork: looks good to me
[01:31:40] <Cork> ya i know
[01:31:51] <anli_> Cork: Maybe I should have done it with script to start with instead of inline, a strange thing is that onclick comes after a delay
[01:31:54] <lkeijser> hi, i'm looking for a lightbox-like effect to show text (only), but then in a fixed place like between two div's. Is this possible?
[01:32:14] <SugaSlide> djQuery hmm im messing around with a theme for jqui
[01:32:32] <clockwize> guy, it still doesn't work! It still just pops the image up :( http://pastebin.com/UqyEsSxk
[01:32:46] <SugaSlide> like changing paddings n stuff.. just too lazy to add the extra bits into the eg page
[01:32:51] <si458> hi people
[01:33:03] <djQuery> clockwize: shame to put all that work into it and not have a working demo see ?demo
[01:33:03] <bot-t> clockwize, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:33:12] <si458> is the someone in here who can help me with the .unload command
[01:33:31] <si458> i need my webpage to do a php script when the window/tab is closed
[01:33:36] <si458> is it possible to do this?
[01:33:37] <djQuery> clockwize: jsbin is good as well. see ?jsbin
[01:33:38] <bot-t> clockwize, JS Bin - Collaborative JavaScript Debugging - http://jsbin.com/
[01:33:49] <si458> i got the when the window closes say sumthing working
[01:33:59] <clockwize> i tried to use jsbin, kept getting javascript errors and nothing happening, then it reset my html and i had to do it agian!
[01:34:00] <djQuery> si458: its a browser limitation
[01:34:08] <si458> but havnt managed to get the run this php script working with the .post command :(
[01:34:11] <si458> oh right :(
[01:34:18] <si458> is the no way around this?
[01:34:30] <djQuery> si458: not that I know of
[01:34:33] <clockwize> http://jsfiddle.net/YAKNc/ but this works
[01:35:01] <si458> well basically i want it so when the user logs in and then closes the browser it sets a value in mysql database to 0 as if they have logged off
[01:35:17] <si458> is the another way of doing this then? without cron and stuff running on the sever
[01:35:32] <si458> ?
[01:36:16] <Cork> si458: not really
[01:36:49] <djQuery> si458: dont know if php has a session end event but in .net there is
[01:36:51] <Cork> closest that exist for that is websocket
[01:37:31] <Cork> si458: something will have to wait for it to happen server side, how ever you do it
[01:38:38] <anli_> Cork: I used alerts in the event handlers, so for some reason the onclick event was forgotten after an alert had popped up informing about the onchange
[01:38:54] <anli_> Just appending to the div as you do is another story
[01:39:16] <Nuck> If I use $.extend to add to the jQuery object, this is already jQuery-fied, right?
[01:39:24] <djQuery> anli_: u just ran into a great reason not to use alerts

[01:39:29] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[01:39:29] <Nuck> Or do I needa do $(this)?
[01:39:55] <Cork> Nuck: it extends the original object
[01:39:57] <Cork> noting else
[01:40:08] <djQuery> Nuck: I forget try console.log(this) and see what it is
[01:40:09] <Cork> is its a jquery object, it says that way, if not...
[01:41:00] <Nuck> djQuery: Okay :P
[01:42:57] <djQuery> anyone used jsviews yet? cant finger out what I am doing wrong here http://jsbin.com/uxenub/24/edit

[02:03:38] <Puck`> guys, while using toggle() can I specify the hide animation? If I do toggle().animation() that's only for showing the element
[02:05:05] <Aamir> Puck`:  i think no but u can see ?slideToggle

[02:05:54] <Puck`> oh perfect, thank you Aamir, just what I was looking for
[02:24:11] <momito> is there a short way of making a .click event only be active when the animation is complete?
[02:27:49] <gar_onn> the callback
[02:28:16] <gar_onn> bind it after the animation with callback of the animation you use

[02:34:12] <aaronmcadam> anyone know what's holding up 1.6.2?

[02:35:47] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano, any idea what's holding back the 1.6.2 release?
[02:37:02] <ndee> is there a way to remove a class with a regex? I have an element with following classes: "rating rating-5-s" and I want to replace rating-5-s with maybe, rating-2-s or rating-3-s.
[02:38:40] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:39:02] <aaronmcadam> couldn't you be smart and do starts with rating-, ends with -s
[02:39:28] <aaronmcadam> [^rating-]
[02:41:23] <aaronmcadam> ndee what have you tried so far?
[02:41:38] <ndee> aaronmcadam, ('.rating').removeClass('rating-([0-9]+)-s');
[02:41:49] <ndee> cuz I read that it supports regex
[02:42:24] <aaronmcadam> it takes a function
[02:42:39] <aaronmcadam> ndee
[02:42:54] <aaronmcadam> so you could test the element's classname in there

[02:46:30] <aschiwi> hi guys! what's the best way to find a jquery plugin for slideshows if I already know what it needs to look like? I need it to look like this: https://skitch.com/aschiwi/f88y5/slidehow and I feel I've seen this before but can't find it anymore.
[02:47:18] <aaronmcadam> dunno
[02:48:49] <[gr]ouzo12> Is it possible to have some guidance on : How can i set a cookie so as long as it is not deleted a ,previusly,hidden div will fadein and remain vissible until an exit button is clicked or untill user leaves the page.I have found how to setup a cookie but i m not sure on how to do the interaction.
[02:49:07] <ndee> aaronmcadam, thx, I found a solution :)
[02:49:59] <arminrosu> sorry for posting code, but why would this evaluate as false
[02:50:06] <arminrosu> if ( {average: 'false'} === {average: 'false'} ) {}
[02:51:51] <aaronmcadam> ndee mind pasting it for me?
[02:52:04] <ndee> aaronmcadam, not fully working yet, I will paste it afterwards :)
[02:52:08] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:52:15] <aaronmcadam> just wondering
[02:52:39] <aaronmcadam> wtf is that
[02:53:05] <aaronmcadam> arminrosu, are you just asking or is that part of code
[02:55:35] <arminrosu> aaronmcadam: part of code, do you want me to pastebin the lot?
[02:55:46] <aaronmcadam> noooo
[02:56:00] <[gr]ouzo12> Damn i got disconnected,any answer about the hidden div and cookie question?
[02:56:04] <aaronmcadam> just wondering why the hell ur doing that arminrosu
[02:56:37] <aaronmcadam> why??
[02:57:06] <pissypaw> sup sup sup
[02:57:22] <arminrosu> aaronmcadam: trying to write a plugin and am at wits end, why options passed are different from defined ones, although contain the same
[02:57:33] <aaronmcadam> you're doing it wrong
[02:57:48] <aaronmcadam> what you're doing doesn't make sense
[02:58:36] <aaronmcadam> you should be checking opts.average
[02:58:49] <pissypaw> if jquery was you dad, what would be his favourite rock band?
[02:58:57] <arminrosu> actually I'm checking opt.settings
[02:59:12] <arminrosu> options.settings = {average: false};
[02:59:16] <aaronmcadam> eh
[02:59:34] <aaronmcadam> can't do that
[02:59:39] <arminrosu> ?
[02:59:41] <aaronmcadam> what about options.settings.average
[02:59:46] <arminrosu> works
[02:59:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:59:58] <aaronmcadam> thats an object literal there it's falsy
[03:00:20] <aaronmcadam> new Object() !== new Object()
[03:00:53] <aaronmcadam> it's not going to compare it like that
[03:01:10] <aaronmcadam> you need to check the keys of settings
[03:01:18] <aaronmcadam> not the whole structure arminrosu
[03:01:28] <arminrosu> thanks aaronmcadam
[03:01:45] <aaronmcadam> np
[03:02:00] <pngl> What is the best way to synchronize animation start on multiple elements?
[03:02:13] <arminrosu> does jquery change objects when passing them as options in a plugin?
[03:02:35] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't
[03:03:06] <arminrosu> hmmm, I'm at a loss then ...
[03:05:41] <Lee_msi> is there a way of syncing classnames across elements. Basically i have a validation plugin, but the select element in my form is hidden and a custom select element appears instead. problem is that when validation runs, it adds the class to the hidden select. I need to propogate that class name change to the custom element too
[03:06:00] <arminrosu> aaronmcadam: can you please have a look at this, maybe you see something I don't
[03:06:01] <arminrosu> http://pastebin.com/tKtki2hL
[03:06:52] <arminrosu> Lee_msi: so you want to listen for an event, that gets fired when input[hidden] gets that class and propagate it?
[03:07:16] <arminrosu> why not just add the classes to all elements in one go?
[03:07:26] <Lee_msi> basically yes, a sort of "onClassUpdate" event
[03:08:22] <aaronmcadam> arminrosu, line 17
[03:08:32] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to say != undefined
[03:08:35] <Lee_msi> Because the validation plugin doesnt do that and while i could hack the script to do it, that would mean the two seperate plugins wouldn;t be seperate anymore. So while i know one way, it isnt the cleanest nor does it go hand in hand with the whole extensibility and portability of jquery
[03:08:43] <aaronmcadam> just if options.settings arminrosu
[03:08:49] <rogy> how to get all style data for a particular #id ?
[03:09:08] <Lee_msi> rogy: $(id).css()
[03:09:18] <aaronmcadam> arminrosu, you've not read what i said properly
[03:09:32] <aaronmcadam> you can't compare objects like that
[03:10:05] <rogy> lee_msi thanks, how can i print them or use the values? are they in key value pairs?
[03:10:39] <arminrosu> aaronmcadam: yeah, sorry, that part of the code is just for checking myself, forgot to take it out
[03:10:42] <aaronmcadam> arminrosu, http://pastebin.com/5Mg2UvUx
[03:10:42] <Lee_msi> its an object, so you can just console.log or maybe use .each()
[03:11:00] <aaronmcadam> line 17 and line 21 changed arminrosu
[03:11:18] <arminrosu> thanks
[03:11:35] <aaronmcadam> rogy, use console.dir for objects alternatively
[03:12:46] <arminrosu> aaronmcadam: line 38, replacing hatter with {average: false} makes it work, anything else breaks pixastic â€¦ that's actually my main goal, to get it working
[03:13:14] <ndee> aaronmcadam, http://pastebin.com/qer0yCgx <-- that's my version :D
[03:13:17] <aaronmcadam> arminrosu, I've not read it all
[03:14:01] <aaronmcadam> weee tweak ndee :P http://pastebin.com/bVZZ0Jr6
[03:14:11] <aaronmcadam> you don't need length > 0
[03:14:26] <ndee> kk :D
[03:14:27] <ndee> thx :D
[03:14:31] <aaronmcadam> np :)
[03:14:42] <aaronmcadam> think I'm gonna save that as a gist
[03:14:45] <zangetsu> hello
[03:16:46] <aschiwi> does anyone here program custom plugins for money? :)
[03:18:08] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:18:19] <ndee> aaronmcadam, what's a gist?
[03:19:20] <aaronmcadam> ndee, https://gist.github.com/1053597

[03:19:47] <aaronmcadam> i keep my snippets there
[03:22:03] <aaronmcadam> good stuff
[03:23:06] <aaronmcadam> some pretty nifty looking string functions here, underscore plugin: https://github.com/edtsech/underscore.string
[03:26:11] <aschiwi> alright if nobody here programs plugins for money maybe you know a job forum I can turn to?
[03:26:24] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:26:36] <aaronmcadam> what do u actually need?
[03:27:01] <aaronmcadam> you should go on the forums anyway http://forum.jquery.com/
[03:27:28] <aaronmcadam> aschiwi, have you looked here http://jquerylist.com/
[03:27:41] <xover> Aren't there web sites specifically set up for trading small ad hoc jobs like this?
[03:27:52] <xover> I'm sure I've ran across them from time to time.
[03:27:57] <FxIII> hi all
[03:28:26] <aaronmcadam> if he told us what he  wanted we might be able to suggest an existing plugin

[03:28:32] <FxIII> while fadeIn works, fadeout does not for svg elements, is this a known issue?

[03:28:54] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[03:29:02] <aaronmcadam> ah sorry hehe
[03:29:08] <aschiwi> no problem
[03:29:18] <aaronmcadam> check jquerylist?
[03:29:22] <aschiwi> I assume everyone's a he, too
[03:29:31] <aschiwi> alright let me check jquerylist first, thanks
[03:30:13] <aschiwi> but if that won't work a job board would be great to have.
[03:30:35] <aaronmcadam> could you not try roundabout?

[03:32:28] <aschiwi> aaronmcadam: oh yeah that's looking good! you think I can mix images with videos in there? I'm no good at jquery, I'm just looking for a script I can include in php.
[03:32:38] <aschiwi> ugh
[03:33:05] <aaronmcadam> ah that doesn't sound good :P
[03:33:20] <aschiwi> thought so :D
[03:33:30] <aaronmcadam> http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/
[03:33:49] <aaronmcadam> it might be possible
[03:34:07] <aaronmcadam> not sure how a playing video would look whilst being animated
[03:34:10] <aaronmcadam> like that
[03:34:19] <aaronmcadam> flash being shite
[03:34:43] <aschiwi> right
[03:34:43] <aaronmcadam> anythingslider works for anything but it's a normal horizontal slider
[03:35:02] <xover> Video != Flash
[03:35:04] <aaronmcadam> i don't think video will work from a ux perspective with that ui
[03:35:12] <aaronmcadam> ah come on
[03:35:14] <aaronmcadam> be realistic
[03:44:02] <FxIII> is there a way to set a watchdog in jquery?
[03:45:31] <dr0id> you mean a dog that'll watch whether jquery is loading or not ?
[03:46:20] <FxIII> I whant a function called after 200ms after another one if the other is not called within 200ms
[03:48:02] <Kambfhase> use a boolean and two setTimeouts
[03:49:20] <ablomen> FxIII, var timeout; function a ( ) { if (timeout) { clearTimeout(timeout); timeout = false; } doSomething(); timeout = setTimeout(b, 200); }; function b ( ) { doSomethingElse(); };
[03:50:02] <ablomen> oh and set timeout to false in b() too so you can run it again
[03:51:41] <FxIII> ok ablomen i was missing the clearTimeout
[03:55:47] <[gr]ouzo12> Any help according how to manipulate (show/hide) a hidden div with cookies?
[03:56:25] <FxIII> is there a way to a function to be called with a progerssive parameter over an intervall of time?
[03:56:40] <DarsVaeda> hi, is there a simple way to negate .hasClass() ?

[04:17:20] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:17:26] <aaronmcadam> wonder what the difference is
[04:20:51] <aaronmcadam> awesomes
[04:22:42] <davetarmac> is #coffeescript a US channel by any chance?
[04:23:09] <davetarmac> everyone seems vewy quiet
[04:23:17] <davetarmac> in the words of Elmer Fudd
[04:24:39] <aaronmcadam> heh
[04:24:41] <aaronmcadam> probably
[04:24:44] <aaronmcadam> like this one
[04:27:43] <orl> Hi!
[04:28:41] <aaronmcadam> yo!
[04:29:11] <orl> I'm trying to use History.js, but I'm not sure to use it the right way (I'm quite sure of the opposite). I'm trying to use after a $.load() (at that point, I already don't know if that's OK), and use History.pushState, but cannot get it working the way I want.
[04:31:29] <orl> here you can see a shortened version of my script: http://pastebin.com/aTbYgCFy
[04:32:22] <orl> I've read the github page of History.js (https://github.com/balupton/history.js) and that article called diveintodogs  (http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html)
[04:32:47] <orl> What I've written is basically kind of an adaptation of the scripts proposed on both those pages and what I feel I need.
[04:33:44] <orl> Actually, the "sufficient" snippet proposed on History.js github (https://gist.github.com/854622) is quite hard to comprehend, and I would need a bit more explanations or skills to understand it, I think.
[04:35:53] <orl> the current behaviour is the following: next and previous arrow become active, the url is changed (hashed - I don't have any html5 ready web browser on that machine). So that part is OK. But when pressing back (or forward) arrows, the url changes, which is OK, but the content doesn't (like no AJAX was reloaded), and so the correct page is finally not displayed.
[04:36:00] <orl> Can someone help me with that?
[04:36:47] <aaronmcadam> orl have you watched remy sharp's video on this stuff
[04:36:56] <aaronmcadam> he uses ben alman's bbq
[04:37:37] <aaronmcadam> i'm not exactly clear as to what you're trying to do though
[04:37:49] <timing> Hi!
[04:37:59] <orl> aaronmcadam: no I didn't know about it.
[04:38:00] <aaronmcadam> if you're trying to maintain a history of hashlinks
[04:38:03] <timing> my jquery $.ajax doesn't fire error when the json is not parseable
[04:38:06] <aaronmcadam> one sec orl
[04:38:06] <timing> how can that happen?
[04:38:18] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:38:36] <orl> aaronmcadam: I'm trying to preserve history and back and forward buttons even if using load in my menu.
[04:38:56] <aaronmcadam> what?
[04:39:11] <orl> (is that 'what' for me?)
[04:39:24] <aaronmcadam> orl http://jqueryfordesigners.com/enabling-the-back-button/
[04:39:38] <aaronmcadam> timing handle errors in your callback
[04:41:08] <jmvelasco> hi there, I am around four hours now trying tounderstand a strange issue with jquery. details=>  http://pastebin.com/50DqZ0Af
[04:42:21] <orl> aaronmcadam: actually, I was really thinking about using History.js as it answers all the problems I get: back and forward buttons, history, url, and so on, in a very clean and compatible way (from what I've seen).
[04:42:41] <technoisy> Is there any doc on removing a loaded page with ajax?
[04:42:48] <aaronmcadam> jmvelasco, explain what you're trying to do, don't just post your code
[04:42:49] <jmvelasco> the JS function is executed, i can see the log from the PHP script called thrugh AJAX, but the beforeSend and success parts are not done. I got form ugly IE8 a jquery error that is not lanched on firefox, but maybe it could help to clarify what could be happening
[04:42:52] <technoisy> for examle, .ajax.Load(url);
[04:42:57] <jmvelasco> i was on that ;)
[04:43:00] <jmvelasco> aaronmcadam,
[04:43:08] <technoisy> any such thing like ajax.remove(url)??
[04:43:24] <orl> From what I understand, bbq is just another way to hash links and listen to hashchange, which is what History.js do, but it also deals with html5
[04:43:59] <jmvelasco> more strange is that the same JS call from an old code is not giving up any kind of error and beforeSend and success are executed normally
[04:44:03] <aaronmcadam> jmvelasco, you're passing a list of functions to call dynamically?
[04:44:21] <Trisox> technoisy: removing ?
[04:44:26] <jmvelasco> aaronmcadam, thank you for your time
[04:44:34] <jmvelasco> i am not sure what is your question
[04:44:49] <aaronmcadam> orl that might help u understand how to do it
[04:44:57] <aaronmcadam> doesn't matter bout the specific plugin
[04:45:00] <Trisox> add it before the ajax $('#something').remove()
[04:45:01] <timing> aaronmcadam: yeah I try to in the error callback
[04:45:07] <aaronmcadam> no
[04:45:07] <timing> aaronmcadam: that's how it worked previously
[04:45:09] <aaronmcadam> in success
[04:45:22] <Ankit_> Hi all
[04:45:22] <orl> aaronmcadam: OK, I'm reading it right now (don't have flash on that machine, neither a soundcard plugged!)
[04:45:26] <aaronmcadam> error is for an actual error in the *request*
[04:45:33] <aaronmcadam> not in the *returned data*
[04:45:44] <Trisox> you can check for error
[04:45:48] <aaronmcadam> you should handle errors in success
[04:45:53] <timing> if I set dataType: 'json' and the return value is: bug;{foo: bar} it fired error in a previous version of jquery
[04:45:56] <Ankit_> can anyone please tell me how to hide anchor tag
[04:46:05] <technoisy> tra
[04:46:06] <jmvelasco> there is an onclick event function that call to a PHP script, the script is well executed since I have logged it and is all as i expect
[04:46:09] <timing> aaronmcadam: but could it be this was different in 1.4 ?
[04:46:13] <technoisy> Trisox yeah
[04:46:19] <technoisy> Trisox yeah that will remove the div
[04:46:23] <technoisy> right?
[04:46:31] <aaronmcadam> timing probably as you need to have valid json
[04:46:32] <jmvelasco> the problem is being at the html content change, if i use other way to show the result is shown
[04:46:33] <Trisox> yup
[04:46:57] <Trisox> if (data.error) { } else { here your succes stuff}
[04:47:04] <Trisox> add that in your ajax call
[04:47:14] <jmvelasco> and the jquery error i can't see why is it
[04:47:14] <technoisy> Ok
[04:47:20] <Trisox> not you :P
[04:47:20] <technoisy> while data.error? no Json.
[04:47:40] <technoisy> not me?
[04:47:43] <Trisox> technoisy: make a jsfiddle plzz with you html and js
[04:48:01] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ technoisy
[04:48:02] <bot-t> technoisy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:48:07] <technoisy> Trisox I just want to know if its possible to unload a url
[04:48:09] <jmvelasco> aaronmcadam, if i add alert(...) i can see the alert window ...
[04:48:11] <technoisy> dont tell me that aaronmcadam
[04:48:22] <jmvelasco> so i feel really confused
[04:48:25] <jmvelasco> and lost
[04:48:25] <aaronmcadam> i didn't the bot did
[04:48:29] <Trisox> ?paste
[04:48:29] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:48:37] <technoisy> aaronmcadam you queried the bot
[04:48:44] <aaronmcadam> jmvelasco, I don't know what you want
[04:48:57] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ BlackAnt
[04:48:58] <bot-t> BlackAnt, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:49:10] <rogy> hello, how to copy the css from one #id and copy it to another #id2 ?
[04:49:49] <BlackAnt> If your not answering my question, pass that line to me multiple times ok@ aaronmcadam
[04:49:49] <jmvelasco> there is click event on a button, when user clicks it, it perform a PHP script, and after that the input button is changed for the PHP script result, that it is a string "process done"
[04:49:58] <aaronmcadam> rogy just $(id).css() will return
[04:50:02] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:50:06] <Trisox> indeed ;)
[04:50:10] <aaronmcadam> paste an example
[04:50:11] <BlackAnt> try again if u can
[04:50:12] <BlackAnt> dude
[04:50:30] <jmvelasco> what i want to to know why i am getting this error, and it is not doing. by other hand very similar code is well run
[04:50:33] <Trisox> aaronmcadam: you just answer faster :D
[04:50:35] <aaronmcadam> ok jmcantrell simple enough
[04:50:44] <aaronmcadam> I've no idea what he wants Trisox
[04:50:47] <Trisox> jmvelasco: is your json valid
[04:50:58] <BlackAnt> A rhetorical question doesnt need jsfiddle
[04:51:00] <jmvelasco> there is no json there
[04:51:11] <aaronmcadam> what's the question?!
[04:51:22] <Trisox> what your parsing then?
[04:51:39] <rogy> aaronmcadam?
[04:51:42] <rogy> i dont get it
[04:51:46] <aaronmcadam> what?
[04:51:55] <jmvelasco> the main problem is $(cont).html(data); is not doing
[04:51:56] <aaronmcadam> oh
[04:51:56] <rogy> rogy just $(id).css() will return
[04:51:59] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:52:08] <Trisox> rogy: $('.something').css() wil return css
[04:52:13] <aaronmcadam> ?css @ rogy
[04:52:13] <bot-t> rogy, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:52:25] <rogy> yeah, but what if i want to copy that css to another id
[04:52:26] <rogy> ?
[04:52:28] <jmvelasco> if i write alert(data) after, i can see the text at the alrt window, but the html code is not changed
[04:52:29] <Trisox> if you put css parameters in .css() you fill it
[04:52:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah simple
[04:52:44] <Trisox> make a var of it or something
[04:53:10] <jmvelasco> also, at beforeSend there is no change to show the animated img to indicate the user the script is running behind
[04:53:26] <jmvelasco> data is a var itself
[04:53:31] <jmvelasco> it is the returned data
[04:54:32] <BlackAnt> I think someone is surprised here
[04:55:00] <orl> aaronmcadam: sorry, I've been disconnected.
[04:55:27] <timing> aaronmcadam: "json": Evaluates the response as JSON and returns a JavaScript object. In jQuery 1.4 the JSON data is parsed in a strict manner; any malformed JSON is rejected and a parse error is thrown. (See json.org for more information on proper JSON formatting.)
[04:55:38] <timing> aaronmcadam: it seems this is not the case anymore
[04:55:40] <aaronmcadam> uh
[04:56:28] <orl> aaronmcadam: OK, I've read your link, it explains how to use hash for navigation, that's OK, I think I've understood (might be that I do not), but it doesn't really tell me how I'm supposed to use History.js, as that's not really the has part which gives me problem
[04:56:50] <orl> (actually, the has part works, the url change too, and the back and forward buttons are visible, but not acting correctly)
[04:57:13] <timing> during development sometimes when php generates an error, the json it returns is bad, that's okay because I had the error callback for that. now it jsut goes to success and it's anoying :-)
[04:57:23] <orl> aaronmcadam: I'm not sure, but I think there might be something with that popstate event, but I didn't really understood what it was
[04:58:05] <natrixnatrix89> hello. guys. how do i get image dimensions using jquery (i want to get the dimensions of the real image, not the element that is shown in the browser)?
[04:58:28] <natrixnatrix89> for example if i have just an image object
[04:58:44] <natrixnatrix89> var image = new image..
[05:01:18] <aaronmcadam> rogy did u get it
[05:02:38] <natrixnatrix89> anyone?
[05:02:41] <emil-malmoe> Dear everyone, there are two books at the library: jQuery - Novice to Ninja by E. Castledine and Learning jQuery 1.3 by J. Chaffer and I do not know which one to pick. Any ideas?
[05:03:01] <emil-malmoe> I'm a javascript and jQuery beginner but have done some C, Java and PHP
[05:03:29] <aaronmcadam> rogy, http://jsfiddle.net/hFtcH/1/
[05:03:52] <aaronmcadam> emil-malmoe, learning jQuery
[05:03:58] <aaronmcadam> the Packt Publishing one
[05:04:02] <aaronmcadam> that's the best
[05:04:03] <lyricnz> hi jquery guys!
[05:04:57] <emil-malmoe> thanks for your advice. I'll pick that one. :) have good experiences from Pack Publishing before
[05:05:03] <aaronmcadam> yes
[05:05:11] <aaronmcadam> don't worry bout the version number
[05:05:15] <aaronmcadam> the content is really good
[05:05:52] <lyricnz> Is there a way to defer browser (re)layouts *during* execution of a big loop?  and just do it once at the end?
[05:06:24] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:06:38] <aaronmcadam> could do some sort of setTimeout maybe
[05:06:38] <emil-malmoe> That's great! :) Well, I'm off for the library then. Bye!
[05:06:43] <aaronmcadam> haha cool!
[05:06:47] <lyricnz> I've got a page, and we're adding a few hundred checkboxes to it via jquery, then going through them all and hiding them all. This causes a layout, which is taking lots of time...
[05:07:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:07:09] <lyricnz> s/a layout/a layout PER hide/
[05:07:12] <aaronmcadam> why don't you fire it at the end
[05:07:46] <aaronmcadam> or why don't you add them to dom as hidden?
[05:07:51] <aaronmcadam> why are you showing and then hiding?
[05:08:32] <lyricnz> I'm not explicitly calling layout, I think that happens inside show/hide.
[05:08:49] <aaronmcadam> i dunno what this "layout" object is you're talkin about
[05:09:02] <aaronmcadam> but I think there's a better way for you to do it
[05:09:14] <lyricnz> it's not an object, it's work done by the browser after I showhide
[05:09:16] <aaronmcadam> and why are are you adding a hundred checkboxes to a page?
[05:09:25] <aaronmcadam> that's repainting, reflow, etc
[05:09:33] <lyricnz> yeah, I asgree
[05:09:45] <aaronmcadam> you're probably doing something inefficient
[05:10:03] <aaronmcadam> there is a plugin i saw ages ago though that handled adding loads of rows to a table quite well
[05:10:03] <lyricnz> the JS itself runs in no time, it's the layout/repaint etc that takes all the time
[05:10:17] <aaronmcadam> why are you adding so many checkboxes?
[05:10:25] <aaronmcadam> is it a ui for a table?
[05:10:27] <lyricnz> Yes
[05:10:30] <lyricnz> I've got a page with ~300 rows, each of which have ~7 checkboxes on them.
[05:10:37] <geekbuntu> aaronmcadam, was wondering same thing...
[05:10:40] <geekbuntu> holy crap
[05:10:42] <aaronmcadam> you could try paginating
[05:10:43] <lyricnz> (as it happens, the rows are a list of permissions, and the columns are the roles)
[05:10:52] <aaronmcadam> to smaller groups of rows
[05:11:07] <aaronmcadam> one sec I'll see if i can find that plugin
[05:11:09] <lyricnz> The usability of the form is another thing entirely :)   I just need a quick fix to survive a bit more ;)
[05:11:17] <aaronmcadam> it's designed exactly for this sort of thing
[05:12:05] <lyricnz> This actually part of a CMS, adding plugins is a wee bit problematic.  But if that's the only solution...
[05:12:24] <lyricnz> I raised one issue about the outright performance, will raise another about the usability
[05:12:30] <aaronmcadam> can't you paginate it
[05:12:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah usability is out the window there lyricnz
[05:12:47] <aaronmcadam> paginate it
[05:12:58] <lyricnz> I agree. But can't really paginate it, because they're kindof only semi-sorted.
[05:13:02] <eirikb> Hello. What do I do if I want to use $el.find but also use selector on $el?
[05:13:10] <aaronmcadam> semi sorted?
[05:13:23] <aaronmcadam> you could just pass get vars to the prev n next buttons
[05:13:46] <aaronmcadam> ?andSelf @ eirikb
[05:14:10] <aaronmcadam> ?test
[05:14:12] <eirikb> aaronmcadam: Works
[05:14:14] <eirikb> Thanks
[05:14:15] <lyricnz> the permissions are nested. the top-level headings are sorted, and the sub-headings are sorted within each group. but if you want permission "XXX" you don't normally know what heading it's under.  So just search for it in page.
[05:14:20] <lyricnz> That's entirely separate issue.
[05:14:22] <aaronmcadam> hmm bot is down again
[05:14:22] <[gr]ouzo12> Any ideas why this gets messed up? http://pastebin.com/dfU8hFVm
[05:14:31] <lyricnz> Ideally, just need a way to defer page layout until the end
[05:14:36] <natrixnatrix89> do you guys know how jquery memory copy works/
[05:14:37] <natrixnatrix89> ?
[05:16:14] <aaronmcadam> lyricnz, this was the one: https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/
[05:16:22] <lyricnz> ok
[05:16:42] <aaronmcadam> no ie6 support tho
[05:19:04] <eirikb> aaronmcadam: Hmm, andSelf always include self then? It will not trigger the selector on it? So I basically need to use $el.find(selector).andSelf().filter(selector) ?
[05:19:40] <aaronmcadam> uh
[05:19:41] <aaronmcadam> no
[05:19:47] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't work like that
[05:20:06] <aaronmcadam> it just adds the preceding selector to the set
[05:20:16] <eirikb> But what if I'm on the root element?
[05:20:23] <eirikb> Like this $('<p>').andSelf().find('p')
[05:20:27] <aaronmcadam> $('ul').find('li').andSelf() = $('ul');
[05:20:42] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense
[05:21:05] <aaronmcadam> think you're misunderstanding the function a little
[05:21:24] <osoba> is there a way to select all (#somethings) and all (#something elses).filter(lalala) ?
[05:21:58] <aaronmcadam> can you just paste an example of what u want?
[05:22:02] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ osoba
[05:22:07] <aaronmcadam> goddammit
[05:22:10] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle osoba?
[05:22:22] <aaronmcadam> ?bot is deadddd
[05:22:27] <osoba> for example i want both $('a[href=/]) and $('a[href$=google.com/]).filter("[href^=http://google], [href^=http://www.google]")
[05:23:25] <osoba> how to say select first or second
[05:23:41] <osoba> either*
[05:23:46] <aaronmcadam> don't you mean "first and second"
[05:24:03] <osoba> i mean select all elements that match either of the two criteria
[05:24:05] <aaronmcadam> $( id1, id2 ).filter....
[05:24:14] <osoba> that would apply the filter to the first item too
[05:24:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:24:40] <aaronmcadam> if you don't want that
[05:24:44] <aaronmcadam> then just use on selector
[05:24:47] <aaronmcadam> i'm confused
[05:24:53] <aaronmcadam> one selector*
[05:25:12] <eirikb> aaronmcadam: From $('<a><b><a>') I want to select 'a', but sometimes the markup look like $('<b><a>') so I don't always want to select the top most element
[05:25:18] <osoba> well im asking because i want to use both
[05:25:43] <aaronmcadam> can you do an example on jsfiddle please
[05:25:54] <osoba> @ me?
[05:25:57] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[05:26:00] <osoba> sigh
[05:26:08] <aaronmcadam> if you want my help...
[05:26:51] <aaronmcadam> there's probably a better way of doing what u want
[05:27:03] <aaronmcadam> but if you can't be arsed then ok :D
[05:27:24] <aaronmcadam> lyricnz, did ya get anywhere?
[05:27:26] <seutje> ?add @ osoba
[05:27:42] <lyricnz> still investigating. pagination is not really a short term option.
[05:27:43] <eirikb> Would it be horrible to wrap in a div?   $('<div>').append($el).find(...)
[05:28:03] <aaronmcadam> lyricnz, god help anyone who has to use it tho lol
[05:28:09] <eirikb> The filter-hack is probably nicer
[05:28:09] <lyricnz> if you're interested - http://drupal.org/node/1203766
[05:28:11] <Smoke> im using 2 jquery script and they give me conflict any solution for that??  i have an week with this problem and no solution.
[05:28:15] <osoba> here zou go http://jsfiddle.net/TRvkV/
[05:28:29] <aaronmcadam> why don't u pass a callback to filter
[05:28:36] <osoba> hmm http://api.jquery.com/add/
[05:28:41] <osoba> thanks seutje
[05:28:48] <eirikb> A callback? Why not just use filter as I said earlier
[05:29:07] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:29:11] <Smoke> im using 2 jquery script and they give me conflict any solution for that??  i have an week with this problem and no solution.
[05:29:12] <eirikb> Example?
[05:29:27] <aaronmcadam> and test if it matches the first selector or second
[05:29:50] <aaronmcadam> eirikb, http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[05:30:06] <eirikb> This works with filter: var s = 'a'; $('<b><c>').find(s).andSelf().filter(s)
[05:30:11] <seutje> Smoke: can u please be a little more vague, we might actually be able to guess what your problem is with this humongous load of information
[05:30:17] <aaronmcadam> hhaha
[05:30:27] <aaronmcadam> have you tried ajax Smoke :D
[05:30:50] <eirikb> aaronmcadam: Sorry I don't understand what you mean, how could I use it in a better way?
[05:30:53] <seutje> "ajax smoke" now there's an original idea
[05:31:07] <aaronmcadam> ok
[05:31:10] <osoba> thanks seutje that worked :D
[05:31:16] <osoba> @ add
[05:31:27] <seutje> the andSelf with a filter also works
[05:31:34] <seutje> might wanna jsperf it
[05:32:21] <osoba> meh its just a simple script for a lighbox
[05:32:23] <eirikb> It's not a lot of elements though
[05:32:44] <osoba> i just want to select both locally linked home page and the full url linked
[05:32:53] <osoba> aka both "/" and "site.com"
[05:33:23] <osoba> anyhow thanks and tata o/
[05:35:45] <seutje> that's pretty stupid, absolute links to ur own domain o.O
[05:36:07] <aaronmcadam> haha
[05:36:17] <aaronmcadam> i like your style seutje :p
[05:36:28] <seutje> the fuck...
[05:36:37] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[05:37:36] <seutje> Smoke: ugh, why do u ask me if it's ok to PM me when ur just gonna do it anyway?
[05:39:07] <Smoke> seutje  hmmm,  do u have any solution for that?
[05:39:19] <seutje> uhm no
[05:39:26] <Smoke> ok thx
[05:39:40] <seutje> tbh, I didn't rly look at it
[05:40:05] <aaronmcadam> did he try ajax seutje
[05:40:27] <aaronmcadam> Smoke, there's this really awesome jQuery plugin you should try, it's called JavaScript
[05:40:35] <aaronmcadam> also, the add plugin is awesome
[05:40:37] <seutje> wow...
[05:40:47] <aaronmcadam> 1.add(2);
[05:40:49] <aaronmcadam> amazing :D
[05:41:22] <Smoke> ?
[05:42:16] <aaronmcadam> jokes what's your problem
[05:42:45] <Smoke> i have a conflict with 2 jquery sliders
[05:42:55] <Smoke>  http://www.testela.al/              this is my site   and i want to include  this in the main content   http://www.testela.al/slider  but doesnt work and i think it is a jquery conflict
[05:43:19] <aaronmcadam> ok christ
[05:43:27] <Smoke> :)
[05:43:44] <aaronmcadam> slider is 404
[05:44:10] <Bitcrusher_> hi guys
[05:44:10] <aaronmcadam> it's working for me
[05:44:16] <aaronmcadam> hey
[05:44:20] <aaronmcadam> ?bot alive?
[05:44:23] <ThomK> Hi. I have problem with jquery.form.js, maybe I will get here quick help. I have form with file field, on every browser it works great, but not on IE. :) I've tried 9 and on nignx there is 499 error (connection closed before nginx even returned something). Any help?
[05:45:07] <aaronmcadam> file an issue on github if it's there
[05:45:20] <aaronmcadam> could well be an ie9 issue
[05:45:36] <Bitcrusher_> anyone know how to run a jquery function, everytime you scroll up/down the page?
[05:45:51] <Smoke> aaronmcadam: any idea for me? what should i try
[05:45:57] <ThomK> AFAIK, other users have same issues, with different IE versions.
[05:46:03] <aaronmcadam> i dunno i can't reproduce it
[05:46:58] <Jon47> Bitcrusher_ http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[05:47:12] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[05:47:18] <aaronmcadam> ?eval(1+1);
[05:47:26] <Jon47> but be very careful what function you call, you may want to put it on a delay and ensure it only runs once at a time
[05:47:34] <blackspotwiggins> bot is ded
[05:47:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah Bitcrusher_ you can destroy performance with it
[05:47:51] <Jon47> different browsers send the scroll event at different frequencies, sometimes it'll get fired super fast
[05:48:04] <Bitcrusher_> Jon47: thanks, weird google didn't bring that page up :-/
[05:48:15] <Jon47> np
[05:48:17] <aaronmcadam> twitter had to downgrade because of how badly they implemented it
[05:48:35] <aaronmcadam> Bitcrusher_, http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[05:48:47] <[gr]ouzo12> Can som1 check this cookie problem http://pastebin.com/dfU8hFVm line 13-14
[05:49:13] <Bitcrusher_> Jon47: ok, what other alternatives are there? I want to reproduce something like the red bar in the bottom of this page, that "docks" when you get to the bottom of the page http://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/thin-and-light-laptops/2011/05/24/dell-xps-15z-40092869/
[05:49:15] <aaronmcadam> read that article Bitcrusher_ shows you how
[05:50:01] <Jon47> yeah .scroll is fine, you just need to understand how to use it
[05:50:04] <Bitcrusher_> aaronmcadam: thanks, bookmarked and will read now :)
[05:50:13] <aaronmcadam> np Bitcrusher_
[05:50:25] <aaronmcadam> I wouldn't use .scroll for that
[05:50:34] <aaronmcadam> it's probably not using it either
[05:50:39] <aaronmcadam> it's just a fixed div
[05:50:47] <Bitcrusher_> no, it uses mootools
[05:50:59] <aaronmcadam> the join|signin| follow red bar
[05:51:05] <Edler> hey guys
[05:51:08] <Edler> any way in jquery
[05:51:14] <aaronmcadam> it looks pretty simple Bitcrusher_
[05:51:17] <Edler> to remove a css attribute (so it becomes default value)
[05:51:18] <Edler> ?
[05:51:21] <Jon47> aaronmcadam, scroll to the bottom of the page, you'll see that the fixed div becomes relative when it scrolls down to the footer
[05:51:25] <aaronmcadam> just a modal window and a bit
[05:51:42] <aaronmcadam> ah
[05:51:43] <Bitcrusher_> aaronmcadam: when you get to the bottom, it changes from position: fixed; bottom: 0; to position: absolute; bottom: x (relative distance to make bottom show)
[05:51:46] <aaronmcadam> i see
[05:51:54] <aaronmcadam> i see it now
[05:52:01] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:52:13] <Jon47> well, actually absolute, but oyu get the idea
[05:52:21] <Bitcrusher_> sorry, yeah
[05:52:22] <Edler> ...?
[05:52:24] <aaronmcadam> probably need to check if the current scroll is the same as the footer's top method
[05:52:40] <aaronmcadam> property i mean
[05:53:13] <Bitcrusher_> i was thinking of using if (($(document).height() - 137) >= 0)
[05:53:19] <aaronmcadam> offsetTop maybe
[05:53:38] <Bitcrusher_> so if there is less than 137 pixels to the bottom, it would be absolute, and over, it would be fixed
[05:53:45] <orl> OK, I've been looking a bit further, if I'm not wrong with History.js thing, I have to tell the behaviour when pressing back and next buttons?
[05:53:49] <aaronmcadam> fair enough
[05:54:01] <orl> using History.Adapter.bind
[05:54:04] <orl> is that right?
[05:54:08] <Bitcrusher_> I must admit, this is my first jquery code ;)
[05:54:11] <aaronmcadam> should work
[05:54:13] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[05:54:17] <aaronmcadam> what were u doin before
[05:54:20] <aaronmcadam> pure js?
[05:54:51] <Bitcrusher_> if needed, so bad js yes, but i'm mainly php and recently java
[05:55:03] <aaronmcadam> christ
[05:55:04] <clockwize> guys, when i do .animate(), how does it know when to stop?
[05:55:17] <clockwize> if i use say {"opacity": "+=0.1"}
[05:55:26] <aaronmcadam> u pass the duration
[05:55:33] <clockwize> my duration is "slow"
[05:55:36] <clockwize> not a fixed number
[05:55:40] <aaronmcadam> it maps to one
[05:55:47] <clockwize> ha ok
[05:55:48] <clockwize> ah*
[05:55:50] <aaronmcadam> u can change it to a number
[05:56:05] <aaronmcadam> 1200 or whatever
[05:56:05] <Bitcrusher_> aaronmcadam: never had the great need for js, but now i'm redoing my companys website, so I want to do it properly, and thought I would learn a bit of jquery at the same time
[05:56:15] <aaronmcadam> cool
[05:56:16] <[gr]ouzo12> irc://freenode/aaronmcadam,isnick Any idea why line 13-14 messes everything? http://pastebin.com/dfU8hFVm
[05:56:24] <[gr]ouzo12> (lmao:P)
[05:56:30] <aaronmcadam> your technique should work ok
[05:56:32] <Edler> no one knows ?
[05:56:33] <aaronmcadam> document.height
[05:56:44] <aaronmcadam> u don't need a jquery wrap
[05:56:47] * Bitcrusher_ hopes aaronmcadam's question "what were u doin before", was directed at him ;)
[05:57:00] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah it was
[05:57:15] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[05:57:46] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[05:58:03] <aaronmcadam> I love how people expect you to read the code to see what they want it to do
[05:58:31] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, specially when its not working
[05:58:40] <aaronmcadam> with no html either
[05:58:41] <aaronmcadam> :S
[05:59:03] <[gr]ouzo12> I guess this was goin for me? (!)
[05:59:08] <aaronmcadam> or when they paste in vast swathes of code and expect you to look at it all
[05:59:18] <aaronmcadam> yeah use jsfiddle please [gr]ouzo12
[05:59:44] <aaronmcadam> ?why no bot :(
[05:59:55] <[gr]ouzo12> Apologies but its the first time i get an answer for this question past 24h,and the "lame" solution whas the last choice i had :(
[05:59:56] <Bitcrusher_> but thanks to the both of you, aaronmcadam and Jon47, i'll read up a bit and see if I can figure this thing out :)
[06:00:11] <aaronmcadam> good man Bitcrusher_
[06:00:24] <aaronmcadam> Bitcrusher_, come back n tell us if you figure it out
[06:00:32] <Bitcrusher_> will do :)
[06:01:04] <aaronmcadam> ?help
[06:03:29] <aaronmcadam> why is the bot down again
[06:04:14] <Kambfhase> bot.t
[06:05:33] <orl> aaronmcadam: History.Adapter.bind(element,event,callback)
[06:05:35] <orl> A framework independent event binder, you may either use this or your framework's native event binder.
[06:05:51] <orl> I'm not sure to understand that (english problem, I think)
[06:06:03] <orl> what would be jQuery native event binder for this?
[06:06:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:07:21] <aaronmcadam> $( el ).bind( 'event', callback);
[06:07:34] <orl> oh simply....
[06:08:12] <orl> so, finally $(window).bind('statechange', callback)
[06:08:56] <aaronmcadam> yep try it
[06:09:05] <orl> then, that callback should be the fucntion which will restore the content if using back or next buttons?
[06:09:25] <aaronmcadam> do: var callback = function(){ console.log( 'state changed!); };
[06:09:32] <aaronmcadam> and then that line
[06:10:00] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, where does console.log go if you don't have firebug installed?
[06:10:08] <aaronmcadam> up it's own arse
[06:10:09] <orl> that's OK, I manager to enter that callback and read "state changed" in the popup
[06:10:15] <aaronmcadam> fb provides the console api haha
[06:10:15] <orl> (pop)
[06:10:17] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:10:25] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:10:26] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:10:28] <aaronmcadam> in chrome it's chrome dev tools
[06:10:41] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[06:11:28] <orl> OK, but still, if I put a $.load() in that callback (after anylising the History.getState output), it doesn't work
[06:11:39] <aaronmcadam> don't use load
[06:11:46] <orl> I mean, the content is erased, but the content which should replace it is not
[06:11:47] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, I know this is troll from the room topic but do you know anything about php?
[06:11:52] <aaronmcadam> try a proper ajax method and see
[06:11:58] <aaronmcadam> it is?
[06:12:01] <aaronmcadam> a troll?
[06:12:05] <orl> sadmicrowave: are you talking to me?
[06:12:05] <aaronmcadam> little bastards
[06:12:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:12:17] <aaronmcadam> I do I work with django now though
[06:12:28] <sadmicrowave> orl, no thats why I put aaronmcadam at the beginning of my statement
[06:12:33] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:12:42] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue sadmicrowave
[06:12:45] <orl> aaronmcadam: are you thinking about $.ajax?
[06:12:51] <aaronmcadam> yep orl
[06:12:52] <orl> sadmicrowave: oh yeah, sorry
[06:12:59] <sadmicrowave> perhaps you could take a look at my SO post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6511913/php-sql-error-message-changed-database-context
[06:13:19] <sadmicrowave> orl, its cool
[06:13:28] <aaronmcadam> eek ur using mssql?
[06:13:44] <sadmicrowave> T_T I know
[06:13:49] <aaronmcadam> :O
[06:13:54] <aaronmcadam> on apache at least?
[06:13:59] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[06:14:05] <aaronmcadam> oh good
[06:14:21] <sadmicrowave> yea I don't do much cli stuf
[06:14:34] <orl> aaronmcadam: just to be sure (cause i've already tried to use $.ajax() and was not really in ease with this), what should lead me to this choice instead of $.load()?
[06:14:54] <orl> I mean, what are the differences and the cartesian reasons to switch back to $.ajax()
[06:14:59] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, my problem is when I try to use the query link_identifier option with mssql_query()
[06:15:02] <aaronmcadam> never seen that before
[06:15:17] <sadmicrowave> crap balls
[06:15:17] <aaronmcadam> load is for pussies orl
[06:15:22] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[06:15:24] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[06:15:40] <sadmicrowave> .load() works well for images
[06:15:41] <aaronmcadam> it's a stripped down shortcut
[06:15:44] <orl> aaronmcadam: thanks for you cartesianism! I don't have anything against pussy
[06:15:54] <sadmicrowave> what about being one?
[06:15:59] <aaronmcadam> i don't, definately didn't last night, heh heh
[06:16:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah it looks very weird
[06:16:28] <aaronmcadam> i wonder if it's mssql specific
[06:16:35] <orl> well let's forget about that by now, but load isn't recommended for loading parts of a document?
[06:16:39] <aaronmcadam> wtf is database context
[06:16:43] <aaronmcadam> or 'itf'
[06:16:44] <orl> that = pussies
[06:16:44] <sadmicrowave> I believe it is, I can use the same context in a mysql_query and it works ok
[06:16:48] <aaronmcadam> utf?
[06:17:01] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, well 'itf' is the name of my database
[06:17:05] <sadmicrowave> but thats all I know
[06:17:05] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[06:17:17] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[06:17:17] <sadmicrowave> I should probably put that in ther
[06:17:20] <aaronmcadam> i get it
[06:17:37] <aaronmcadam> looks like the last thing it does is just selects ur db
[06:17:48] <sadmicrowave> right
[06:17:52] <aaronmcadam> and isn't runnin ur query
[06:18:03] <sadmicrowave> well it fails while trying to run it
[06:18:23] <aaronmcadam> and your sql gives u what u want right?
[06:18:24] <sadmicrowave> and in the die() command the mssql_get_last_message() returns that message
[06:18:32] <sadmicrowave> right
[06:18:34] <aaronmcadam> from mysql admin or whatever
[06:18:59] <aaronmcadam> you've printed out $login_res to see if the string has been built properly and tested that too?
[06:18:59] <sadmicrowave> I just have to use the link_identifier because I switch back and forth between mssql and mysql
[06:19:06] <sadmicrowave> yes
[06:20:46] <shankysv87> i'm having trouble with ajax and fancybox... anyone know if this is a known issue or is it just me? i have an index that loads multiple pages via ajax and without reload.  Setup similar to that of how iframes work, but when i load the container with a document that will call fancybox, it won't show, if its the original page loaded then it works just fine, however if i switch from original load
[06:20:46] <shankysv87> to newly loaded and back again, then it doesn't work once again. any suggestions?
[06:21:07] <aaronmcadam> shankysv87 yeah u can use ajax
[06:21:22] <sadmicrowave> shankysv87, we were talking here...
[06:21:29] <sadmicrowave> lol jk
[06:21:31] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you need to use delegate maybe
[06:21:43] <aaronmcadam> if the event is firing the first time
[06:21:51] <aaronmcadam> but without seeing your code
[06:22:18] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, dang you really like using delegate this is at least the 4th time I've seen you recommend using delegate
[06:22:21] <aaronmcadam> it's impossible
[06:22:25] <aaronmcadam> ahah
[06:22:54] <aaronmcadam> it's because it's the correct way to do it sadmicrowave
[06:23:07] <sadmicrowave> :)
[06:23:14] <sadmicrowave> I'm not debating that
[06:23:26] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:23:30] <aaronmcadam> ?where the fuck are youuu
[06:23:54] <shankysv87> http://pastebin.com/aXJXHrW3 both home.php and newpuppy.php will use fancybox for various uses.
[06:24:10] <sadmicrowave> right here
[06:24:47] <shankysv87> home on first load will show fancybox correctly, switch to newpuppy.php, nogo, switch back to home, no go.
[06:25:04] <momito> is it possible to animate a div  growing from its  center?
[06:25:20] <aaronmcadam> ah christ
[06:25:34] <aaronmcadam> have u got js in those php files.... shankysv87
[06:25:48] <shankysv87> http://pastebin.com/TPTV1SkW
[06:26:03] <shankysv87> the script from those files.
[06:26:07] <aaronmcadam> aaargh
[06:26:14] <aaronmcadam> whyyyy
[06:26:23] <aaronmcadam> that's just stupid
[06:26:43] <shankysv87> idk thats why i'm asking here :P jk (your probably not talking to me for that last one)
[06:26:53] <aaronmcadam> don't put js includes in external files and then call them with ajax  and expect it to work properly
[06:27:01] <aaronmcadam> I am shankysv87
[06:27:13] <orl> are you ?
[06:27:14] <aaronmcadam> include your js in the root document ffs
[06:27:47] <UglyBOB> Hi, can anyone have a look at this? http://pastebin.com/uR085nVy
[06:28:34] <aaronmcadam> uh
[06:28:37] <sadmicrowave> UglyBOB, what are we supposed to do with it?
[06:28:47] <aaronmcadam> UglyBOB, aren't you loading the same HTML content of element back into itself there
[06:28:52] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make much sense
[06:28:56] <UglyBOB> yes I am Aaron
[06:28:58] <aaronmcadam> $(element).html($(this).html());
[06:29:06] <UglyBOB> that code is javascript that needs to be refreshed
[06:29:18] <aaronmcadam> A call to document.write() from an asynchronously-loaded external script was ignored.
[06:29:19] <UglyBOB> each time it's loaded, it calls an external javascript to add different content
[06:29:28] <aaronmcadam> serves u right for using document.write :D
[06:29:33] <shankysv87> aaronmcadam: ah! it works fine now, ty!
[06:29:34] <sadmicrowave> lol
[06:29:42] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:29:48] <UglyBOB> i don't use it, it's in the external file, over which i have no control
[06:30:17] <aaronmcadam> now repeat what aaron told you, "don't include js ever again in php files called by ajax"
[06:30:53] <UglyBOB> not sure what you mean by that...
[06:31:04] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking to shankysv87
[06:31:10] <UglyBOB> ah ok
[06:31:11] <Kambfhase> UglyBOB: you could try using jQuery.getScript() not sure if that is cross-dmoain though
[06:31:23] <aaronmcadam> JSONP baby
[06:32:01] <aaronmcadam> probably not
[06:32:09] <aaronmcadam> doesn't mention sop in the docs
[06:32:13] <aaronmcadam> but probably is
[06:32:33] <UglyBOB> would it help if I show the code that is reloaded on itself?
[06:32:48] <aaronmcadam> is there no other way?
[06:33:00] <aaronmcadam> might be another technique u can use
[06:33:33] <EdwardIII> hey
[06:33:51] <sadmicrowave> hi
[06:33:58] <pmarsh> I'm doing a simple append() with a <h1><a href='foo'></h1> every time the href is blanked out
[06:34:04] <EdwardIII> i've got 2 seperate jquery-ui tabs bits. is there something i can do to seperate them? i.e. can i somehow feed different class names (as opposed to id=tabs) into the jquery tab builder?
[06:34:16] <sadmicrowave> pmarsh, can you show your code?
[06:34:21] <sadmicrowave> jsfiddle or pastebin
[06:34:25] <pmarsh> sadmicrowave: yes, one sec
[06:34:53] <UglyBOB> Aaron, here I added the full code: http://pastebin.com/BLp04wKz
[06:34:53] <EdwardIII> i realise i can just change jQuery( "#tabs" ).tabs({ to point to #tabs-home instead for example which is great, but then what about all the resultant generated source?
[06:35:04] <sadmicrowave> EdwardIII, I don't know, I made my own tabs instead of using jquery tabs
[06:35:29] <seutje> pmarsh: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/4pkj5/
[06:36:07] <kborchers> EdwardIII: yes, you can use class names instead of id's to create UI tabs
[06:36:51] <seutje> pmarsh: there, now u can see and click it http://jsfiddle.net/4pkj5/1/
[06:37:42] <EdwardIII> kborchers: i'm actually alright with hooking jquery to the tabs, it's just the styling
[06:37:52] <EdwardIII> actually i guess i can just overrite that stuff using inheritence, e.g. border: 0;
[06:37:58] <EdwardIII> uninheritence heh
[06:38:24] <pmarsh> seutje: found the typo while pasting it :) thank you
[06:38:47] <pmarsh> seutje: had a whole bunch of stuff in there for jquery mobile and accidently had an extra href
[06:39:19] <seutje> so u lied to me :(
[06:40:00] <DarsVaeda> hi, anyone can help on preventing the resizing of the  first column of the table when hovering "Raum1" and so on? -> http://jsfiddle.net/SZUZC/
[06:40:43] <DarsVaeda> I actually do not get why it is resized, but maybe thats a question for #html...
[06:42:05] <Aamir> DarsVaeda:  for #css
[06:42:18] <DarsVaeda> or that
[06:43:43] <domcat> Is i possible to exclude image from lazy loading? the issue I have is that I have image in a hidden block that when is displayed then lazy load should not apply to that image
[06:43:59] <Aamir> DarsVaeda:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/SZUZC/2/
[06:44:26] <aaronmcadam> ?up yet
[06:44:27] <aaronmcadam> ?
[06:44:33] <aaronmcadam> ?test
[06:44:41] <DarsVaeda> yeah that was my first idea too, but as there can be more columns I would have to compute the width's
[06:44:47] <Aamir> domcat:  filter that image in ur selector while applying lazyload? :/
[06:44:48] <DarsVaeda> that will be a mess I think
[06:45:26] <Edler> someone help
[06:45:27] <Edler> if i have
[06:45:33] <UglyBOB> aaron, mind having a quick look at the dynamically loaded javascript?
[06:45:40] <domcat> Aamir: I have the lazy load installed as a WP plugin,  it would not be the best option to edit plugin as in the next update my chnages could be lost :(
[06:45:41] <Edler> {something : "..", anything : function(){...}}
[06:45:47] <Edler> how cna i from inside the anything function
[06:45:49] <Edler> reference something ?
[06:46:08] <Aamir> DarsVaeda:  thats because input increases the width of td. you can try making input's width smaller than the text width like http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/SZUZC/3/
[06:46:30] <Edler> ...
[06:46:56] <Aamir> domcat: you don't to edit the plugin. its just the line where you actually apply the plugin
[06:47:16] <Aamir> Edler:  ?
[06:47:17] <Aamir> what
[06:47:37] <Kambfhase> Edler: this
[06:49:24] <Edler> thx
[06:49:27] <domcat> Aamir: I am not sure I understand you
[06:53:02] <Edler> anyone here knows how to work with Google Earth api, i have a paid project for it
[06:54:59] <VictorCL2> hola
[06:55:15] <mipo> Como esta
[06:55:25] <VictorCL2> what is fastest or better  ,  find("div[class=white]")  or find("div.white")   ???
[06:55:58] <jmvelasco> VictorCL2, i think you'll need profiler ;)
[06:56:19] <UglyBOB> velasco, can u help me?
[06:56:24] <jmvelasco> you can check it by your own with firebug i guess
[06:56:48] <VictorCL2> but the examples I gave .. are exactly the same thing no?
[06:56:56] <jmvelasco> i am not a jquery guru, but i guess it is the same
[06:56:59] <jmvelasco> yeah, i think so
[06:57:31] <kborchers> VictorCL2: speed is going to differ based on your html, computer, etc. but I imagine they are very similar. the selectors should work the same and div.white is better just because it's cleaner looking ;)
[06:57:34] <jmvelasco> it's a good question to a jquery developer who could know what need extra process to understand
[06:57:46] <jmvelasco> :D
[06:58:14] <jmvelasco> i agree but find("div[class=white]") has more information about what you are looking for :p
[06:58:27] <kborchers> VictorCL2: you could check the speed at http://jsperf.com but like i said, it will be very much dependant on your situation
[06:58:46] <VictorCL2> i will do test with firebug then to compare
[06:58:58] <jmvelasco> div.white you need to kwnow it is a class syntax, with dic[class=white] it's more clear you are lookinf for a class called white
[06:59:08] <jmvelasco> good choice VictorCL2
[06:59:14] <jmvelasco> from Chile maybe ?¡
[06:59:18] <VictorCL2> si

[07:05:16] <jmvelasco> Hazardrix mayeb this link could help you : http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html

[07:05:45] <b0c1> :)
[07:06:07] <mengu> hi. i have a table and i would like to append a new element just before the latest <tr>. is it possible?
[07:06:09] <UglyBOB> can anyone look at this problem? http://pastebin.com/BLp04wKz
[07:06:15] <jmvelasco> even i am atletico madrid supporter, the team we always lose lol
[07:06:17] <b0c1> spain is a good place, but I can´t learn the language :)
[07:06:30] <b0c1> jmvelasco: srry... :)
[07:06:39] <b0c1> jmvelasco: barca the best ;)
[07:06:42] <kborchers> mengu: by latest, do you mean last?
[07:07:13] <hazardrix> jmvelasco ok, thanks, looks a bit unclean, but as long as it works ;)
[07:07:41] <jmvelasco> it has been just hte first match from css input file search
[07:08:03] <jmvelasco> so, i guess you can surf until you get the information you need
[07:08:06] <mengu> kborchers: sorry, yes.
[07:08:10] <hazardrix> hehe, ok ;)
[07:08:26] <jmvelasco> UglyBOB, i agree it should work :/
[07:09:01] * jmvelasco doesn't want to work today, but he might do, so ... see you around
[07:09:07] <kborchers> mengu: $("#elementToInsert").insertBefore("#tableID > tr:last"); try that
[07:09:08] <UglyBOB> why does it give that warning then?
[07:09:15] <MoTiOnXml> how do you get the name of a property given an index?
[07:09:26] <MoTiOnXml> is that possible or do i have to loop + compare?
[07:10:49] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: what index? you can not count on properties to be in the same order across browsers
[07:12:47] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: i'm not; i'm serializing an object to querystring params etc.
[07:12:53] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: doesn't matter the order
[07:13:17] <MoTiOnXml> kborchers: just curious if i can get the name of index i, as is the case with the value
[07:13:37] <MoTiOnXml> like { key: value}[0].getName()
[07:13:40] <b0c1> hmm... a question. How can I convert ¨data[x][y]¨ = ¨asd¨ to js object?
[07:14:04] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: hmm, i see. not sure on that one, sorry
[07:15:51] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: you can do a for in loop, but pls note: properties do not have an order
[07:16:22] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: like i suggested; thanks
[07:16:31] <SuRfDeMoN> Hi, does anyone know which version of jquery, ajax works in? i'm getting errors about undefined properties and they are coming from within jquery.js
[07:16:32] <kborchers> Kambfhase: yeah, i already told him that but he explained a little more and he's not actually working with "properties"
[07:16:46] <Kambfhase> kk
[07:16:51] <MoTiOnXml> :)
[07:16:55] <MoTiOnXml> i'm good :)
[07:17:11] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, i found a nice impl.
[07:17:16] <Kambfhase> SuRfDeMoN: more information pls, browser, jq version, code, etc.
[07:17:42] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: example online? do you have a link to share as i am curious?
[07:17:51] <SuRfDeMoN> reference to undefined property jQuery.cache[id][name]
[07:18:28] <kborchers> MoTiOnXml: i mean of the implimentation you found
[07:19:12] <SuRfDeMoN> Line 507http://pastebin.com/GiFkifVX
[07:19:22] <SuRfDeMoN> jquery 1.2
[07:19:30] <SuRfDeMoN> i've tried other versions of jquery
[07:19:31] <billy_ran_away> Anyone familiar with iTunes?  You know when you're browsing the iTunes store they draw borders around apps when selected? http://iphoneaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/uninstall-apps.png I'd like to borders like that around some images when they're selected... anyone have any techniques for doing something like that?
[07:19:45] <SuRfDeMoN> each give errors about undefined things from jquery.js
[07:19:58] <billy_ran_away> Currently I have just a blue image that I stretch around my image for it to be selected, but it looks really plain since it doesn't have rounded corners...
[07:20:00] <SuRfDeMoN> with the same code as shown in that pastebin
[07:20:23] <gar_onn_> SugaSlide, do you have a pastebin?
[07:20:38] <SugaSlide> lol
[07:20:49] <billy_ran_away> And there's another monkey wrench, on a different screen I'd like to display multiple color'ed borders to represent certain metadata... i.e. one image might have a blue and red borders...
[07:20:50] <gar_onn_> SuRfDeMoN, can you give the pastebin agan plz
[07:21:01] <aaronmcadam> SuRfDeMoN, you're doing something very wrong if jQuery itself is erroring
[07:21:06] <VictorCL2> is fireQuery  any good ?
[07:21:12] <aaronmcadam> ye
[07:21:15] <aaronmcadam> excellent
[07:21:26] <SuRfDeMoN> with jquery 1.6.1 i get this message "reference to undefined property jQuery.valHooks[this]
[07:21:29] <SuRfDeMoN> Line 2484
[07:21:40] <SuRfDeMoN> exact same code http://pastebin.com/GiFkifVX
[07:22:03] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you're not getting mixed between attrs and prop
[07:22:14] <SuRfDeMoN> just changing the content of jquery.js to new jquery version
[07:22:15] <aaronmcadam> remember the new change?
[07:22:24] <mekwall> startkeylogger
[07:22:27] <UglyBOB> can anyone look at this problem? http://pastebin.com/BLp04wKz
[07:22:27] <aaronmcadam> are u not aware of it
[07:22:33] <mekwall> oh noes :(
[07:22:38] <SuRfDeMoN> aaronmcadam: no change?
[07:22:48] <aaronmcadam> SuRfDeMoN, http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/
[07:23:20] <aaronmcadam> ah nevermind
[07:23:23] <cwillu_at_work> is there a way to get something similar to $().is(':visible'), except that also excludes :hidden elements?
[07:23:40] <aaronmcadam> excludes?
[07:24:00] <aaronmcadam> :hidden cwillu_at_work
[07:24:05] <cwillu_at_work> yes
[07:24:16] <aaronmcadam> ah
[07:24:26] <aaronmcadam> $().is(':visible').not(':hidden')
[07:24:29] <aaronmcadam> ?
[07:24:33] * cwillu_at_work tries
[07:24:47] <aaronmcadam> doesn't make any sense though
[07:25:08] <aaronmcadam> it's the diff between visibility and hidden i spose
[07:25:09] <cwillu_at_work> aaronmcadam, I think you're labouring under the same misconception I was until a few minutes ago
[07:25:19] <aaronmcadam> haha really
[07:25:20] <cwillu_at_work> hidden items are considered visible for the purposes of :visible
[07:25:24] <cwillu_at_work> (yes, really)
[07:25:33] <cwillu_at_work> because they still take up layout space :p
[07:25:34] <aaronmcadam> I've just said that I know the difference
[07:25:54] <billy_ran_away> This plugin, http://css-tricks.com/examples/InsetBorderEffect/, could almost work, but double borders can't be different colors...
[07:25:55] <cwillu_at_work> heh
[07:25:58] <cwillu_at_work> lets restart :p
[07:26:01] <aaronmcadam> just from seeing that code tho it doesn't make for nice reading
[07:26:20] <SuRfDeMoN> aaronmcadam: still gives the same error
[07:26:27] <cwillu_at_work> I have form fields that get hidden, which saves alot of time on reflows that I don't need on underpowered devices
[07:26:36] <aaronmcadam> I dunno i didn't really read ur paste srurf
[07:26:56] <SuRfDeMoN> aaronmcadam: jQuery.valHooks[this] undefined property
[07:27:02] <cwillu_at_work> $().is(":visible") still lists them as visible though
[07:27:55] <aaronmcadam> I don't know surf I didn't read ur code
[07:28:03] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[07:28:06] <aaronmcadam> course it would?
[07:28:12] <aaronmcadam> that's what you're matching?
[07:28:38] <aaronmcadam> you want not(), not is() in that case?
[07:28:41] <aaronmcadam> ?are you working?
[07:28:43] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jQuery.trim() - Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[07:28:48] <aaronmcadam> bout time
[07:31:39] * geekbuntu i like trim - saves me from myself
[07:31:51] * geekbuntu trim == good
[07:37:48] <Trisox> cwillu_at_work use :hidden
[07:38:07] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, doesn't work
[07:38:17] <Trisox> not is
[07:38:23] <cwillu_at_work> I know
[07:38:28] <Trisox> just like $('.something:hidden')
[07:38:40] <cwillu_at_work> it's the parent that's hidden though, not that specific element
[07:38:43] <cwillu_at_work> that seems to break it
[07:38:43] <Trisox> $('.something:visable')
[07:39:02] <Trisox> :)
[07:39:10] <cwillu_at_work> yes, doesn't work :p
[07:39:58] <cwillu_at_work> $('.required:visible') returns the element, and chrome's dev tools highlight a blank region when I hover it.  $('.required:hidden') doesn't return it at all
[07:42:03] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, $('.required:visible') on http://scaletech.cwillu.com/truck/
[07:45:09] <Bitcrusher_> aaronmcadam: do you have a moment to look at my code, tell me what I'm doing wrong? ;)
[07:45:39] <Bitcrusher_> sounded like you had an idea about how to solve my problem before
[07:46:39] <aaronmcadam> aye
[07:49:50] <cwillu_at_work> doh, I bet this is due to the lack of an updated jquery
[07:50:18] <cwillu_at_work> huh, no.
[07:51:19] <Trisox> cwillu_at_work: try $('.something:visible').length see what you get back
[07:51:25] <Trisox> $('.something:hidden').length
[07:51:44] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, 1
[07:51:58] <Trisox> so its hidden
[07:51:58] <cwillu_at_work> hidden: 0
[07:52:04] <Trisox> mmm
[07:52:06] <cwillu_at_work> visible is 1, hidden is 0
[07:52:39] <lessless> people, had anybody do google-alike preview of the page without images ?
[07:53:18] <BMCouto> Hi, anyone knows a good plugin to require several js files and have a callback when all of them are loaded?
[07:54:01] <codecab> when i call $.find().concat() it says ".concat is not a function".. why?
[07:54:13] <codecab> doesnt $.find() return an array?
[07:54:18] <mengu> kborchers: thank you very much. insertBefore did help.
[07:55:35] <UglyBOB> can anyone look at this problem please? http://pastebin.com/BLp04wKz
[07:56:49] <Trisox> cwillu_at_work: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/VMLNG/6/
[07:56:54] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, as of 1.3.2, "visibility: hidden" doesn't show up as ":hidden" or .not(":visible"), as it uses the offsetwidth/height, and a visibility: hidden item has both
[07:56:57] <Trisox> take the style off you see it
[07:57:12] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, yeah, you missed that bit before :p
[07:57:13] <Trisox> should work
[07:57:28] <cwillu_at_work> I was specifically wanting to avoid the reflow from changing display to none
[07:58:15] <Trisox> wy
[07:58:23] <codecab> when i call Array.concat() on the returned array of a $.find()-call i gett the following error message: ".concat is not a function".. why?
[07:58:33] <Trisox> you could use classes and check on them give it class hiddenItem
[07:58:44] <[gr]ouzo12> I give up!Cookies seem not to work in here.Any help? http://pastebin.com/7JXd85VG
[07:58:44] <cwillu_at_work> because a reflow takes half a second on a slow device, and a visibility: hidden is instantaneous
[07:59:13] <codecab> Trisox: u should NEVER select by classes
[07:59:17] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, that's what I used to do, still pretty slow
[07:59:22] <codecab> if you need to, prepend with TAG
[07:59:42] <Trisox> say never never
[07:59:44] <Trisox> ;)
[08:00:01] <cwillu_at_work> yeah, I use class selectors all the time, and have no interest in prefixing tags in those cases
[08:00:09] <cwillu_at_work> they're not performance critical, and things break less
[08:00:52] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, hmm
[08:00:59] <aaronmcadam> haha
[08:01:04] <codecab> well.. youre whining about a slow script :>
[08:01:07] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, looks like I could just add a specific check of .css('visibility') in addition to the :visible
[08:01:17] <cwillu_at_work> codecab, in a place unrelated to that
[08:01:58] <cwillu_at_work> codecab, it's possible for it to be okay for one thing to be slow, while another thing has to be fast :p
[08:02:06] <Trisox> just cash your selectors if used often easy speed up
[08:02:24] <codecab> ye, real cash cash monaay
[08:02:27] <cwillu_at_work> something that requires a round trip is gonna be half a second anyway in this instance, while something completely local...
[08:02:29] <ThiefMaster|work> did i miss something or is there no function to get offsetWidth/Height?
[08:03:24] <Trisox> ?offset
[08:03:24] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[08:03:34] <ThiefMaster|work> not width/height but x,y
[08:03:56] <ThiefMaster|work> i.e. thw width/height including border etc
[08:03:56] <Trisox> you prob should write it your self
[08:04:06] <Trisox> css with ;)
[08:04:09] <cwillu_at_work> Trisox, $(thing).is(':hidden') || $(thing).css('visibility') === 'hidden' works perfectly
[08:04:26] <kborchers> ?outerheight @ ThiefMaster|work
[08:04:26] <Trisox> well use that then ;)
[08:04:27] <bot-t> ThiefMaster|work, .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[08:04:37] <Trisox> indeed that one ;)
[08:04:39] <cwillu_at_work> it's just what I would have expected :hidden and :visible to do in the first place :p
[08:04:40] <kborchers> ?outerwidth @ ThiefMaster|work
[08:04:41] <bot-t> ThiefMaster|work, .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[08:05:10] <[gr]ouzo12> Could som1 point out the problem in this script?After 24 hours i still cant figure out how to set and manipulate something with cookies :/  http://pastebin.com/7JXd85VG
[08:06:47] <UglyBOB> is my script so disturbing that no one can look at it or solve it?
[08:07:29] <aaronmcadam> well u are called UglyBOB
[08:07:38] <aaronmcadam> ?g UglyBob @ UglyBOB
[08:07:39] <UglyBOB> lol
[08:07:39] <bot-t> UglyBOB, Ugly Bob - South Park Archives - Cartman, Comedy Central, Trey ... - http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Ugly_Bob
[08:07:48] <UglyBOB> i have my bag on
[08:07:51] <UglyBOB> so it's safe
[08:08:46] <UglyBOB> this problem is driving me crazy for 2 days
[08:09:58] <Whirl3d> where is your script?
[08:10:20] <UglyBOB> here: http://pastebin.com/BLp04wKz
[08:10:55] <aaronmcadam> why does it have to be reloaded tho?
[08:11:05] <aaronmcadam> what part is dynamic?
[08:11:12] <UglyBOB> it's an ad server... each time the js gets reloaded, it shows a different ad
[08:11:26] <aaronmcadam> right
[08:11:35] <UglyBOB> that whole thing is just in a div
[08:11:39] <UglyBOB> no php is involved here
[08:11:51] <UglyBOB> just html and jquery
[08:11:52] <aaronmcadam> how are u reloading it?
[08:12:10] <aaronmcadam> line 4 still makes no sense to me tho
[08:12:26] <UglyBOB> why not?
[08:12:28] <aaronmcadam> it looks redundant
[08:12:40] <UglyBOB> how else can I reload only a specific DIV with the same content?
[08:12:42] <aaronmcadam> element is basically the same as this there
[08:13:02] <UglyBOB> $(this).html($(this).html());
[08:13:09] <UglyBOB> should work too yes
[08:13:11] <aaronmcadam> what's in the div?
[08:13:15] <Whirl3d> where are you getting the html?
[08:13:26] <UglyBOB> inside the div is that ad code
[08:13:31] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense UglyBOB the html should be exactly the same
[08:13:49] <aaronmcadam> are you saying when u refresh there's a unique script being called
[08:13:59] <aaronmcadam> that html() call would not be making a request
[08:14:13] <Whirl3d> UglyBOB, you should have a script that loads the content and then unloads it and load the next content
[08:14:15] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna have to use YQL with JSONP
[08:14:17] <UglyBOB> it works perfectly with other javascript... just not this code
[08:14:59] <UglyBOB> how would that go whirl3D? somediv.html() returns the html inside that div and reloads it
[08:15:28] <UglyBOB> let me show you the div
[08:15:47] <aaronmcadam> it's not going to *refresh* it though
[08:16:09] <UglyBOB> but the javascript gets reloaded?
[08:16:19] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(adURL, {dataType:"html",success:function (data) {$(targetdiv).html($(data))}});

[08:17:31] <DynamicFail> I'm trying to learn how to create a form that would change based on values the user selects. IE if the user selects a -> they get group x of questions if they select b-> they get group y for one section. I also would like the user to be able to have zero to many sections of group Z... any good tutorials on how to do this?
[08:17:35] <UglyBOB> Whirl3D: but your "adUrl" i don't have... I only have a block of code... which contains the loading of an external js
[08:18:10] <Whirl3d> I still don't see where you get any html for the ad even in the loaded js
[08:18:22] <rethus> why the validateion-plugin didn't work here: http://kfz-schwalmtal.de/neueSeite/kontakt.php
[08:18:27] <rethus> i don't see the problem
[08:19:35] <Whirl3d> UglyBOB, are you trying to say that the url for the next content comes from the loaded content?
[08:21:23] <UglyBOB> there is no url... I only have this javascript code which gets included via an external file (tags.js) over which i have no control
[08:21:35] <UglyBOB> all that code block does is display an advert
[08:21:45] <Whirl3d> Where is tag.js?
[08:21:55] <aaronmcadam> do u not need to trigger a page refresh though UglyBOB to get a new script?
[08:22:28] <UglyBOB> no, the page can't be refreshed, only the inside of that div should be refreshed
[08:22:41] <UglyBOB> that's why i try to load it with the same javascript code
[08:22:56] <UglyBOB> tags.js is in that codeblock
[08:23:04] <UglyBOB>  http://pastebin.com/s9yhndK3
[08:23:11] <Whirl3d> Which lines?
[08:23:17] <UglyBOB> 17
[08:23:40] <Whirl3d> cute. that's the include. What is inside tags.js
[08:24:12] <UglyBOB> external code, on a different server
[08:24:46] <UglyBOB> it just returns some ad code
[08:27:56] <Whirl3d> it appears to load a script called displayAd.js and adds a hash so that it loads fresh each time
[08:28:47] <TheJohlin> Hello guys, I think I've encountered a bug, or it's just me not thinking straight... http://jsbin.com/ihaseh/edit
[08:28:55] <UglyBOB> yes, if document.write would not be ignored
[08:29:04] <TheJohlin> [Warning] Will crash tab in chrome
[08:30:39] <Aamir> TheJohlin: you have included jQuery and you are using var images = document.getElementById('main-view').getElementsByTagName('img'); ?
[08:31:00] <Aamir> Also use .each instead of for loop :|
[08:31:39] <TheJohlin> @Aamir: Don't know how to put it into an array with jQuery, it seems to make an object out of every one of them!
[08:31:40] <Whirl3d> So the tags.js script is your ad factory, it should handle loading the new content (which is always going to be the script displayAd.js) and it uses a unique hash each time it loads the script so that it reloads it
[08:32:10] <Whirl3d> so we need to see the content in displayAd.js.
[08:32:32] <Whirl3d> It will most likely have the timer and the call back to the factory to generate a new ad
[08:32:44] <UglyBOB> Ok Whirl I get that, but shouldnt it be possible to set .html() with whatever displayAd.js returns?
[08:33:02] <Whirl3d> your factory should do that
[08:33:13] <UglyBOB> it does that
[08:33:22] <UglyBOB> when i refresh the page, it returns a different ad each time
[08:33:28] <aaronmcadam> you're not making another request UglyBOB !
[08:33:33] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[08:33:44] <aaronmcadam> i've told u that like 3 times
[08:33:49] <kborchers> TheJohlin: try http://jsbin.com/ihaseh/3/edit
[08:33:53] <Whirl3d> Wow, what's the issue then?
[08:34:01] <UglyBOB> but tell me then how to make that request, based on a click!
[08:34:26] <aaronmcadam> I told u
[08:34:26] <UglyBOB> i thought outputting the javascript with html() would make a new request to displayAd.js
[08:34:38] <aaronmcadam> use YQL with JSONP if it's a crossdomain script
[08:34:42] <aaronmcadam> no
[08:34:59] <aaronmcadam> you're not getting a new script when u call html()
[08:35:28] <notze> he guys little selector question how can i get the <a href="www.fr">text</a> by the text value?
[08:35:29] <UglyBOB> ok, gotta read up on that then, cause never heeard of it
[08:35:43] <aaronmcadam> it's easy
[08:35:45] <Whirl3d> $("#adelementid").click(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); expo9_ad().apply($(this)).... or something like that
[08:35:47] <aaronmcadam> ?yql @ UglyBOB
[08:35:51] <bot-t> UglyBOB, yql | jQuery Plugins - A easy to use jQuery YQL query execution plugin. Easy to use MySql like queries: $.YQL(query,callback) http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/yql
[08:36:29] <aaronmcadam> UglyBOB,  http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-cross-domain-ajax-request-with-yql-and-jquery/
[08:36:32] <snackbucket> I'm doing a $.get() in ie7.  The response is an HTML string but no matter what I do, I can't get it to act like a jQuery object.  x = $(response) gives me an object, but I can't do any jquery operations on it.  Any suggestions?
[08:36:47] <Whirl3d> you get the new script when you instantiate a new expo9_ad() command
[08:36:51] <TheJohlin> @kborchers, Thanks! Still curious about why my code didn't work..
[08:37:12] <Whirl3d> in fact, you could likely do $("#ad").click(expo9_ad);
[08:37:16] <Aamir> TheJohlin:  http://jsbin.com/ihaseh/4/
[08:37:26] <albacker> $('#foo:selected').attr('value'); does it return the value of the option inside the select with id 'foo' ? or is selected just for checkboxes.
[08:37:32] <UglyBOB> no Whirl, that would make it ad specific to that server
[08:37:40] <UglyBOB> it should work with any ad provider
[08:38:18] <Whirl3d> how would that make it specific to any server?
[08:38:27] <Beta2K> Hello all
[08:38:28] <UglyBOB> they all offer a slice of javascript code to include, but all use a different ad server
[08:38:41] <kborchers> TheJohlin: not sure, it was a mess. ;) This is even better http://jsbin.com/ihaseh/5/edit
[08:38:44] <Aamir> albacker:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/g7QrD/1/
[08:38:48] <Beta2K> I'm having some trouble loading a colorbox window in IE8
[08:39:08] <Whirl3d> UglyBob, that has to be handled by your displayAd.js script.
[08:39:11] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ynPH6/   - -- using draggable/sortable items but i cant get my `dragstop` event to fire?? wtf??
[08:39:30] <Whirl3d> in tags.js, it sets everything up and reloads the displayAd.js script
[08:39:55] <Whirl3d> so, by calling the initialization function for the ad, you reload the script
[08:39:58] <Beta2K> I'm not sure the javascript is actually firing, I've added a onclick to a <a> tag that calls a function that instantiates the colorbox
[08:40:13] <Whirl3d> and it could be on any server the displayAd.js decides
[08:40:18] <albacker> Aamir, what about something like this : $('#team_field:selected').attr('value')  ?
[08:40:20] <UglyBOB> ok
[08:40:31] <janthony> http://pastie.org/2140335 - I made a jquery function to give me a time output I need. Is the way I did this really needed, or is there a more simple way to produce a timestamp with my exact format with a one line similar to how I did it with my php example listed in this pastie?
[08:40:41] <VictorCL2> how do you make this symbol  ~  with the alt key?
[08:40:50] <swiggy> can someone help me with jqueryUI draggable/sortable items?? i cant get my event - dragstop - to fire?!?!?!?! http://jsfiddle.net/ynPH6/
[08:40:58] <Whirl3d> if you look at tags.js, you'll see that the ad always loads the same url (with a different hash to ensure that it is freshly loaded);
[08:41:09] <swiggy> ugh figures djquery isnt online yet :(
[08:41:52] <Whirl3d> so if the content comes from somewhere else, that has to be deteremined by the script that keeps getting reloaded. If you bind click to create a new ad (over the old ad), it will load a new script on click
[08:42:19] <Aamir> albacker:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/g7QrD/2/
[08:42:33] <UglyBOB> ok gotcha :)
[08:42:48] <UglyBOB> i have to restructure some stuff
[08:43:20] <Aamir> albacker:  to get the value, better to use .val()   http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/g7QrD/3/
[08:43:44] <Beta2K> Anyone know where to start trying to figure out what IE8 is doing to break my function?
[08:44:50] <Beta2K> Speakign of which, is there any way to stop the browser from going forward on a <a href> when it has a onclick?
[08:44:51] <kborchers> Beta2K: ie8 has developer tools so you can console.log from your function to see whats going on
[08:45:26] <aaronmcadam> ?preventDefault @ Beta2K
[08:45:27] <bot-t> Beta2K, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:45:36] <kborchers> Beta2K: return false from onclick or if you are binding to the click event with jquery, see ?preventDefault

[08:45:55] <sukima> swiggy: could there be a conflict in that you are defining a sortable and a draggable in the same element?
[08:46:11] <swiggy> they arent tho
[08:46:33] <sukima> Your draggable element is a child of a sortable element.

[09:24:50] <Dykotomee> Hey guys, stupid question: is there any reason why animations aren't working?
[09:25:10] <Dykotomee> I'm doing something as simple as $('#MyTable').slideUp() and all it does is make it disappear.
[09:25:22] <Dykotomee> It's as if the animations are broken.
[09:25:26] <djQuery> wao: yeh desktop chrome it will still allow entry of non numerics. you could bind to keydown and change and check to see if it passes isNAN
[09:25:35] <[gr]ouzo13> This script  works ok untill it comes to the cookies.I cant find a way to make em work :/http://jsfiddle.net/bkEEb/7/
[09:25:54] <Dykotomee> Is there a common mistake for animations? Am I missing something obvious?
[09:25:58] <Acorn> ben_alman: hey, I saw your code for adding jquery to bookmarklet, and was wondering if you had any tips for doing the same with userscripts..
[09:26:31] <Acorn> ben_alman: With this I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'noConflict' of undefined"  https://gist.github.com/284f17e79f4716401e61

[09:28:04] <djQuery> wao: http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaScript/Form-Control/AllowingOnlyNumbersintoaTextBox.htm
[09:28:29] <Dykotomee> So of course animations don't work with tables, trs, and tds. :-/
[09:28:32] <djQuery> wao: but you would need to fix it to allow , . backspace as well

[09:34:41] <systemfault> VictorCL2: Perhaps the problem is... **drama**you**drama**
[09:35:04] <swiggy> ie: you move slide 1 to slide 4, it should then update slide 1 to say slide 4, and slide 4 to slide 5, slide 2 to slide 1, slide 3, to slide 2..
[09:35:07] <swiggy> ill do all that work
[09:35:07] <[gr]ouzo13> Could someone help with $.cookie correct syntax here? http://jsfiddle.net/bkEEb/9/
[09:35:17] <swiggy> but i cant get it to tell me when a slide has been move and to what location
[09:35:18] <systemfault> VictorCL2: The "The website must look the same on every browser" mentality is wrong..
[09:35:54] <VictorCL2> tell that to a client .. that doesnt understand websites .. he just want the stuff to look fine
[09:36:11] <djQuery> VictorCL2: you know in a couple years that every site will have rounded corners so sites will start putting square corners to look different. just tell the client that he is allready ahead of the cubist movement
[09:36:47] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah haha, I was saying that to a friend a few days ago :P "Square corners are the new rounded corners" :P
[09:37:02] <Noeble> #django
[09:37:06] <VictorCL2> well he is correct xD .. but didnt want to do the extra work convincing him we work only with ie9 .. which is the newest

[09:42:07] <z3yo> Is there a function which can reset a form ?
[09:42:42] <z3yo> I'm searching "reset" on the documentation, I find anything
[09:42:48] <necromancer> z3yo: <button type="reset">Reset</button> :)
[09:43:00] <necromancer> it's part of HTML
[09:43:17] <necromancer> i think <input type="reset" works too
[09:43:22] <z3yo> necromancer, Ok now with JQuery ?
[09:43:34] <necromancer> why would you need jQuery if you can accomplish it with HTML...
[09:43:38] <necromancer> why would you need jQuery if you can accomplish it with HTML...?*
[09:43:41] <djQuery> swiggy: have you looked at stop?
[09:43:54] <z3yo> Because I can't display the button
[09:44:01] <swiggy> im using change
[09:44:03] <Beta2K> Hrm, apparently Windows updated me to IE9, not IE8
[09:44:09] <swiggy> i was using stop
[09:44:13] <necromancer> z3yo: so how's the form going to be reset?
[09:44:23] <djQuery> swiggy: no ur using update
[09:44:34] <swiggy> right, thats what i meant
[09:44:44] <z3yo> It's my question : Is there a JQuery function which can do this ? necromancer
[09:44:50] <djQuery> sounds like either should work
[09:44:52] <swiggy> because my thought was, there is no reason to check it unless it is changed
[09:45:08] <jessica__> http://pastebin.com/yhb4uUcv how to show loading animation til it shows the output in div block
[09:45:09] <djQuery> z3yo: see jsisjs
[09:45:16] <necromancer> z3yo: no, there's not. it's one line of code, go figure it out.
[09:45:21] <djQuery> ?jsisjs
[09:45:22] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:45:24] <necromancer> ?find
[09:45:24] <swiggy> stop is unnecessary since it might still be in the same spot
[09:45:25] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:45:28] <necromancer> ?val
[09:45:29] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:45:32] <necromancer> read up.
[09:45:33] <swiggy> whereas update means its always changed
[09:45:47] <djQuery> $('form').reset();
[09:45:50] <swiggy> and i only need to check and change the legends for the slides, if they are changed
[09:46:13] <z3yo> I dissapointed, JQuery is so powerful, but it can reset a form ...
[09:46:24] <z3yo> can't
[09:47:24] <jessica__> why isnt anyone even trying to help me
[09:47:31] <jessica__> are you guys too busy or am i ignored?
[09:47:36] <ravenzz> because you are a female.
[09:47:41] <Aamir> PlsHelp:  try wrapping your <i></i> in another div and style it position relative
[09:47:46] <ravenzz> and here we are all gay
[09:47:46] <ravenzz> .
[09:48:08] <jessica__> does that even make any sense
[09:48:26] <z3yo> necromancer, djQuery http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/08/clearing-form-data << I think this kind of function should be native to JQuery
[09:48:54] <ravenzz> jessica__ i'm joking :|
[09:49:02] <Aamir> jessecrouch:  before your $.post line    $('div#image').html('Loading...')

[09:49:10] <Aamir> jessica__:  ^ for u
[09:49:10] <ravenzz> me

[09:50:17] <PlsHelp> Aamir not work
[09:50:54] <Aamir> jessica__:  something like http://pastebin.com/GM966yCW
[09:51:05] <Aamir> PlsHelp:  cannot check, dont have IE8
[09:51:10] <ravenzz> yep
[09:51:53] <ravenzz> as Aamir said
[09:52:19] <necromancer> z3yo: personally, i wouldn't find a use for that at all and it would just bog down jQuery core
[09:52:21] <necromancer> for me
[09:52:30] <necromancer> z3yo: but you could just encapsulate that into a plugin
[09:52:51] <necromancer> z3yo: if you REALLY think it should be part of core go talk to the dudes in #jquery-dev or fork the code yourself on github and make a pull request
[09:54:54] <z3yo> necromancer, a plugin is enought
[09:55:06] <necromancer> ?plugins
[09:55:09] <bot-t> necromancer, Project types | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/

[09:55:45] <z3yo> There is submit(), I was sure to find reset()
[09:55:52] <necromancer> heh
[09:56:05] <necromancer> well it's not really a common action to capture
[09:56:13] <necromancer> because it just resets all form fields to nothing
[09:56:20] <necromancer> and there's a button that just does that
[09:56:49] <albacker> having a radio check called #foo, what's the elegant way to get 0/1 in a variable depending if it'se checked or no?
[09:57:28] <z3yo> Is there a function which check the typeof a selected element ?
[09:58:28] <z3yo> Like this : $(#myTable);   the function return me "table", is there something like that ?
[09:58:31] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ynPH6/5/
[10:02:17] <PlsHelp> Somebody help me please. The red square does not disappear in IE8, everything else was ok. demo: http://www.proverstka.ru/demo/demo.html

[10:04:50] <albacker> didn't know prop :)
[10:05:02] <Daninmass> hi all. I'm having an issue removing a <br> from a table cell, maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong. > http://jsfiddle.net/4fZJJ/
[10:05:09] <djQuery> albacker: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[10:05:09] <systemfault> Using a selector is more 1337 though.
[10:05:18] <DynamicFail> basic jquery question: Why does this:  var num = $('.clonedInput').length not use new but this: ar newNum  = new Number(num + 1);  use new
[10:06:11] <systemfault> DynamicFail: unboxed vs boxed values
[10:06:38] <DynamicFail> systemfault, could you elaborate a bit more?
[10:06:47] <Daninmass> i tried using parent() and prev() but neither seems to work for me
[10:06:49] <djQuery> Daninmass: are u sure its a <br> and not a /r/n
[10:07:01] <Daninmass> yes defintely
[10:07:34] <systemfault> DynamicFail: In javascript, you have a primitive (number) its boxed equivalent(Number) which is an object
[10:07:54] <systemfault> DynamicFail: I don't know why he used new Number in that case ...
[10:08:26] <systemfault> You pretty much never need to use new.
[10:08:30] <alexKour> hello,could som1 highlight what is goin wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/bkEEb/10/ :/
[10:08:32] <DynamicFail> hmm
[10:08:33] <DynamicFail> alright
[10:08:49] <Daninmass> I would assume I'm not traversing properly, but it looks right
[10:09:14] <DynamicFail> systemfault, so he could have just done var newNum = num +1;
[10:09:41] <systemfault> Sure.
[10:11:01] <Daninmass> anyone have any suggestion on this? removing a br from a table cell? - http://jsfiddle.net/4fZJJ/
[10:12:47] <systemfault> Daninmass: Ugly but this http://jsfiddle.net/4fZJJ/1/
[10:13:27] <systemfault> The br was a stupid idea... why don't you remove it from the template?
[10:13:38] <Demascus> Just when I was feeling smart, I decided to try jQuery. Either there's something wrong with my browser or there's a "how-to" doc missing from damn near every project I find, or (more likely) I'm not nearly ready for jQuery.. ?
[10:13:58] <djQuery> swiggy: did that get it for you?
[10:14:35] <swiggy> eh sorta
[10:14:36] <Demascus> Take: http://www.datatables.net  for example.. There's not one scrap of install help anywhere I can find.. not on the site, in the forums, or in the download.. ?
[10:15:11] <Daninmass> systemfault it's part of a sharepoint 2007 form and I dont have access to edit the layout directly.  that's a little ugly, but it works , thank you.  Any idea why my code wasn't working by chance?
[10:15:27] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ynPH6/6/
[10:15:40] <swiggy> notice how it also changes the notes | add note fieldset too
[10:15:54] <swiggy> and not the remaining slides below it
[10:17:28] <djQuery> swiggy: put a diffent class on the fieldset that contains the header legend. or on the header legend itself and find it by fieldset.legendclass.
[10:17:41] <systemfault> Daninmass: I pasted the solution..
[10:17:47] <swiggy> u smarty
[10:17:48] <systemfault> Daninmass: Have you checked it?
[10:18:05] <swiggy> but how come it doesnt update the other slides (below it)
[10:18:31] <Daninmass> systemfault yes, it works, I said thank you :). I was wondering if you happen to know my code was not working
[10:18:58] <djQuery> also might wanna apply class="draggable ui-widget ui-widget-content"   and for the header apply class="ui-widget-header"
[10:19:16] <djQuery> swiggy: ^^ might give it a nicer look
[10:20:16] <systemfault> Daninmass: My guess is that the .remove function doesn't work recursively.. (the br was in the span)
[10:20:37] <systemfault> Daninmass: .parent() gives the td
[10:21:10] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/ynPH6/7/  -- if im understanding you right, it is setting them all to '1' no matter which its moved to
[10:22:18] <Daninmass> systemfault hmm. OK thank you again :)
[10:23:35] <djQuery> hey notes off to the right now
[10:23:36] <swiggy> sorry djQuery  i forgot to update the html --> http://jsfiddle.net/ynPH6/8/
[10:23:39] <swiggy> use that as an example
[10:34:25] <rns> anyone know why jqueryUI tabs would not work with cookies on ajax submits?  Seems to work fine on a full page refresh...
[10:34:53] <djQuery> swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ynPH6/10/
[10:35:24] <djQuery> swiggy: notice that you have to grab the slideid to drag now
[10:38:33] <swiggy> fucking perfect
[10:38:36] <swiggy> i like that idea too
[10:38:44] <swiggy> good thinking

[10:41:38] <billy_ran_away> Anyone know how to do a selector for all images with one class OR another class?

[10:42:19] <djQuery> billy_ran_away: same way in jquery
[10:42:21] <swiggy> lol
[10:42:31] <billy_ran_away> djQuery: So $('img.class1,.class2')

[10:43:28] * billy_ran_away runs along
[10:43:51] <djQuery> billy_ran_away: hmmm I thought it was all over the place that it can use any css selector
[10:44:46] <djQuery> watch 10 mins of a technical vid and they start going into how great thier doc writers are but I still have no idea what the product does.
[10:44:46] <billy_ran_away> It's not here, http://api.jquery.com/class-selector/ or here http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

[11:26:21] <Demascus> djQuery: Well I flew at it assuming there would be a .js file to include, and that I'd call it within the HTML using either a button or a "on load" ? Inside the .zip there's a buttload of files and examples.. none seem to work.. there's a media\js\ dir with a few files in it.. "jquery.dataTables.js" looks closest to what I might want to include?
[11:27:25] <Demascus> Clearly I'm missing something really basic and since there's nobody looking for that item it's probably like some fundamental step you're "supposed to know" .. ?

[11:32:43] <KWhat_Work> is it possible to move event listeners around ?
[11:32:51] <rns> djQuery, no it's being set on a form, and the entire form is being returned via ajax
[11:32:55] <djQuery> daneroo: I am pretty good with templates
[11:33:00] <KWhat_Work> for example move event listeners bound to obj1 to obj2
[11:33:17] <daneroo> Iam in the processing of selecting a client side template solution.

[11:34:04] <daneroo> I thought that jquery-templates' official plugin status meant it was the obvious choice
[11:34:23] <djQuery> daneroo: haveing trouble finding a solution that has databinding as well myself.
[11:34:32] <MoTiOnXml> after calling destroy on a widget instance, if instancing the widget again (on the same element), only init() is called; how come?

[11:34:46] <djQuery> daneroo: http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/movies/PagesCore/movies.html
[11:34:59] <MoTiOnXml> i was under the impression that destroy() effectively removed all relation about the instance and element
[11:35:01] <djQuery> daneroo: http://www.borismoore.com/2011/04/jquery-bay-area-conference-presentation.html?showComment=1309286904385#c2300548248483410624
[11:35:09] <daneroo> the setup I am replacing has a lot of event-binding going on, simultaneously to the dom-generation...
[11:35:17] <djQuery> daneroo: http://borismoore.github.com/jsviews/demos/index.html
[11:36:01] <djQuery> daneroo: a lot of the event binding can be replaced using see ?live
[11:36:01] <bot-t> daneroo, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:36:09] <djQuery> or see ?.delegte
[11:36:10] <bot-t> djQuery, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:36:38] <djQuery> bot-t: you deserve a botsnack for getting it right even with my typo
[11:36:39] <bot-t> djQuery, Is that a question?
[11:36:40] <Beta2K> Anyone know how to close a colorbox from within it's content?  The content is loaded via ajax
[11:36:45] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[11:36:46] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[11:36:46] <daneroo> I saw borrismoores jsview, is he one of the main jQ-template authors ?
[11:37:01] <djQuery> daneroo: he is the original author
[11:37:16] <zjk> hey do you know how to unbind an event that has not a namespace ?
[11:37:24] <djQuery> daneroo: but I am having problems with jsviews my self. http://jsbin.com/uxenub/24/edit
[11:37:28] <Beta2K> http://www.parksfurniture.com/c/Sofa.php&test click on the Save 5% button then try and click the close link at the bottom for my attempt at it :)
[11:37:55] <daneroo> do you think jsview is just an experimental playground, or the way jQ-templates is going....
[11:38:02] <djQuery> daneroo: notice it correctly iterates over the data but does not actualy display the data http://jsbin.com/uxenub/24/edit
[11:38:22] <djQuery> daneroo: dunno.
[11:38:51] <daneroo> the code you pasted is your own 'test' ?
[11:39:17] <djQuery> daneroo: yes it is. was hoping to use it to create a kinda jsfiddle for data structures
[11:40:21] <djQuery> daneroo: as close as I can see I am doing the same way as him
[11:40:32] <daneroo> You are blowing my mind, hadn't seen either jsbin, or jsfiddle !
[11:40:44] <daneroo> I need to hang around here more !
[11:40:54] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: familiar with widgets?
[11:41:01] <djQuery> daneroo: I am likeing jsbin more now.
[11:41:37] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: yeah they are the things that Acme Inc. sells right? that and sprockets
[11:41:46] <daneroo> OK, I will go away and look your example over.
[11:41:53] <Shyne> http://newspg.net/news/news3.html | I am trying to load a file into the div, then create a slider from it but when i put the html inside the main file it works fine, when i load it from an external file it doesnt create the slider
[11:41:56] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: you got it - did you see my question above?
[11:42:41] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: if that is the case destroy is not completing correctly
[11:43:04] <djQuery> _create should be called the 2nd time after calling a destroy
[11:43:19] <alexKour> There is a piece of code that works fine on fiddle but when it comes to the localhost version its not.Any help? http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/4/
[11:43:30] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: is this a particular widget or oneu are making
[11:43:34] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: here, it doesn't, and i'm using the widget-template that calls the prototype destroy() etc.
[11:44:03] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: one i'm building from the widget-template
[11:44:23] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: version? 1.9 adds some cool new stuff
[11:44:23] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: the one here @ https://gist.github.com/374414
[11:44:42] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: is 1.9 out?!
[11:45:00] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: noppers. think we still got at least a month or 2
[11:45:15] <djQuery> 1.8.14 just came out
[11:45:28] <djQuery> but dont think it fixes anything with widget itself
[11:45:31] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: yea, i read about the new widget stuff in 1.9 from ajpianos slides, but i'll go with the official release so far
[11:46:16] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: also got a little on my blog http://davidjquery.com/?p=9
[11:46:24] <djQuery> YES I KNOW I NEED A NEW THEME
[11:49:07] <PKKid-Work> djQuery, Very defensive about you're theme.. ;)
[11:49:11] <PKKid-Work> your*
[11:49:31] <djQuery> PKKid-Work: just switched it now its not terrible but not great either
[11:50:15] <jsaxey_> general ? here (specifically about the "BeautyTips" jQuery plugin, but should apply to most)...
[11:50:43] <jsaxey_> the plugin is called with $(element).bt(). how do I unbind this plugin from the element?
[11:51:16] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: if you creat a very simple jsbin or jsfiddle that creates a new plugin that all it does is console.log in _create and it still exhibits the issue you should submit a bug
[11:51:42] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: just tested more - it seems it works; must have been a flux - weird!
[11:51:57] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: not sure how i was calling the destroy() method tho', it was really late last night
[11:52:01] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: $("div.cms-ribbon").ribbon("destroy"); ?!
[11:52:39] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: calling like that works;
[11:53:01] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: $("div.cms-ribbon").ribbon({}); -> $("div.cms-ribbon").ribbon("destroy"); -> $("div.cms-ribbon").ribbon({});
[11:53:17] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: thus create/init, destroy, create/init
[11:54:23] <jsaxey_> no one? :(
[11:55:11] <MoTiOnXml> a detour: if you feel like reading a great scifi book i recommend Ringworld by Larry Niven ;)
[11:55:58] <djQuery> jsaxey_: depends on how the plugin was written and what it does
[11:56:38] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: check out http://www.worldswithoutend.com/
[11:56:59] <MoTiOnXml> if jQuery has a construct like mootools' Class it would be perfect
[11:57:22] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: nice link :)
[11:57:42] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: have got the 4 Ringworld books lined up - can't believe the first is from 1970
[11:57:59] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: it's like watching Alien in 2011 and thinking it's still kick ass
[11:58:12] <Kambfhase> jQuery is a DOM lib. is you need classes use a inheritance lib
[11:58:48] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: point taken - recommendations?
[11:59:16] <Tomashe> if ($(this).parent().parent().parent().css("border-color")!="#51952b") {
[11:59:20] <Tomashe> hey guys this itn working
[11:59:21] <Tomashe> any idea?
[11:59:33] <Kambfhase> what do you need? simple inheritance, big modules, ES5, ...?
[12:00:01] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Tomashe
[12:00:02] <bot-t> Tomashe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:00:10] <Tomashe> oohh i c
[12:00:14] <Tomashe> i need to check bg color
[12:00:18] <Tomashe> if it's match that color
[12:00:32] <djQuery> Kambfhase: hmmmm jqueryy ui has some inheritnce built in
[12:00:34] <jsaxey_> djQuery: k, i might have figured it out (sort of).
[12:01:02] <alexKour> Any idea why this code works on fiddle but not at localhost? http://jsfiddle.net/nRJrx/4/
[12:01:10] <djQuery> ThomK: how about see ?closest

[12:04:06] <g0bl1n> can one bind a load event to a select element ? something like $('#myselect').load(function() {.....})
[12:04:51] <Kambfhase> g0bl1n: no, a selecct element does fire load, do you mean change?
[12:05:23] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, I'd like to populate the select element upon page load
[12:05:42] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, or even when loading the page, as soon as possible
[12:06:19] <Kambfhase> put your js right beneath the <select> element then
[12:07:10] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, I don't mix them. I have all the js in a single file
[12:08:14] <Kambfhase> you could just do a function call though and have the function definition in the js-file
[12:08:29] <Kambfhase> ore maybe try custom events
[12:09:57] <zjk> do you know how to unbind all click event but not click.namespace ?
[12:14:06] <dschuett> what is the function to get the rightmost 2 characters of a string such as this ('00' + mystring, 2)

[12:17:52] <djQuery> Tomashe: you know with html and no js errors
[12:19:04] <Tomashe> i just want to know what is wrong or my condiftion is looking ok?
[12:19:10] <Tomashe> i want to to try build everything now
[12:20:10] <MrPink_> hello... I want to use jQuery and output all links on a site of a certain domain... I found the *= so that I can say it contains the domain name... and I have the right selector to select the links... how would I output the URL ?
[12:20:31] <denysonique> which HTTP status codes are considered erroneous by $.ajax?
[12:20:59] <Kambfhase> Tomashe: when you get the color via .css("border-color") it will bereturned in the patter: rgb(ab, cd, ef) dont ask me why
[12:21:35] <MoTiOnXml> speaking of prototypes ..
[12:22:11] <MoTiOnXml> for the CMS here, i currently use a global (var cms = new Cms({..})) that contains the state info about the current request etc.
[12:22:25] <Kambfhase> MrPink_: like this: $('a[href*="google.com"]').attr("href") ?
[12:22:27] <MoTiOnXml> isn't it nicer to put that one in a prototype?
[12:22:37] <MrPink_> so far my jQuery Statement looks like this: http://pastebin.com/8hY550EH   how would I output all the url that have been selected?
[12:22:39] <MoTiOnXml> such that all objects contains access to .cms?
[12:23:34] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, load() is awesome
[12:24:29] <djQuery> MrPink_: see ?.each
[12:24:29] <bot-t> MrPink_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:30:52] <MrPink_> djQuery: Kambfhase: thx everyone works great :)
[12:36:29] <dschuett> if I have a string that is 1 digit but want to make it 2 digits such as 01, how would i do that? -> something like this: var mystring="1"; RightMost("00" + mystring, 2)
[12:38:02] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: upon doing this: Object.prototype.cmsHttpState = cms // <- a state object, when i do $(document) i see two members entitled "cmsHttpState" in the debugger, but for other objects like $("div") i only see one member
[12:38:09] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: i find that a bit odd
[12:38:20] <djQuery> dschuett: ?g javascript string padding with 0

[12:38:29] <bot-t> dschuett, JavaScript: String trimming and padding | Dream House - http://sajjadhossain.com/2008/10/31/javascript-string-trimming-and-padding/
[12:39:07] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: dunno
[12:39:26] <MoTiOnXml> allright
[12:39:41] <MoTiOnXml> is that a good pattern?
[12:39:54] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, using a prototype property to make a state var available to all instances?
[12:40:26] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: never extend Object.prototype ! and i mean nevar!
[12:40:57] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: noted :)
[12:41:20] <Kambfhase> Other wise you'll end up in JavaScript Hell!
[12:41:31] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: yea, wtf am i doing - just reflected :)
[12:41:46] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: Element should be safe i guess
[12:42:22] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/03/02/maintainable-javascript-dont-modify-objects-you-down-own/
[12:44:09] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: right, so what's the recommended pattern for making a state available? just put it on window?
[12:44:44] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: i need the state to construct calls to json services etc.
[12:45:34] <Kambfhase> either wi dow, or create a module. if you are the only person on the page wwindow should be fine
[12:45:59] <MoTiOnXml> i'm not the only person on the page, but i need a single global var
[12:46:19] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: so that leaves jQuery.prototype out of the equation i guess
[12:46:21] <craveytrain> question for the jquery general populace. Does anyone have any numbers they can point to about primed cache with jquery, versions, hosts (or which cdn), etc?
[12:47:57] <Kambfhase> you can put your stuff on jQuery.prototype. I only recommend doing that for methods though
[12:54:34] <bill20r3> What's the syntax to assign a step() func to an already-existing animation bound to an already-existing div?

[13:00:58] <rns> anyone know why this isn't setting my cookies via ajax?  http://dpaste.com/560942/
[13:01:04] <rns> it only works on full page refresh

[13:17:33] <c0m> hi... Im using binding a function ok doc load... when select changes, I am unbinding it and then rebinding it by doing element.functionname() but that doesn't seem to be working... is that the right way?

[13:24:52] <c0m> again, sorry for lack or info and shorthand, on phone
[13:25:20] <Kambfhase> to change the arguments, do: .datepicker( "option" , optionName , [value] )
[13:25:48] <c0m> if I do my_element.unbind() I can't do my_element.satetimepicker() again...bit doesn't work
[13:26:37] <Kambfhase> why do you do .unbind?
[13:27:00] <c0m> because your method I tried alreqdy and doesn't work
[13:27:20] <rns> anyone know why this won my cookies via ajax?  http://dpaste.com/560942/
[13:27:23] <c0m> thought unbind was alternative

[13:27:26] <rns> anyone know why this wont set my cookies via ajax?  http://dpaste.com/560942/

[13:30:44] <c0m> if I use first example and then I want to use second example for same element how do I do that

[13:30:54] <wraithguard02> Hi, I have an element with several buttons inside. I want to fade it out when the mouse leave the element, and fade in when the mouse hovers back over. That works great, if they stay in the container directly, but when they enter the button, it fades back out. How can I prevent this?
[13:30:58] <djQuery> ?ui.datepicker
[13:30:58] <bot-t> The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[13:31:09] <Techdeck> hey guys, how do you select a div using 2 classes that div has?
[13:31:17] <Techdeck> simple .classA .classB didn't work
[13:31:53] <Kambfhase> ?p @ wraithguard02
[13:31:54] <bot-t> wraithguard02, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:31:58] <c0m> no, not UI darepicker.... addon found on that link I gave
[13:32:23] <Kambfhase> Techdeck: $('div.classA.classB') << no space there!
[13:32:30] <Techdeck> ah
[13:32:31] <Techdeck> thanks!
[13:33:05] <wraithguard02> http://pastie.org/2141626
[13:33:15] <Kambfhase> tman: $('form').attr('action','yourAction')
[13:33:32] <djQuery> c0m: looks likehe is just inheriting from ui.datepicker though
[13:33:40] <wraithguard02> <div class='controls'> is the container for the buttons
[13:33:45] <Kambfhase> wraithguard02: use mouseleave/mouseenter !
[13:33:56] <djQuery> c0m: so the same way that datepicker allows you to change options his should as well
[13:34:14] <wraithguard02> ooh, didn't know such an event existed. Thanks!
[13:34:32] <Kambfhase> wraithguard02: mouseover/mouseout are evil!
[13:34:38] <wraithguard02> why?
[13:34:58] <wraithguard02> I mean, in this circumstance, I see why, but in general?
[13:35:07] <Kambfhase> for the very reason you just discovered. they fire when you interact with a child
[13:35:18] <wraithguard02> ah
[13:35:24] <wraithguard02> ok, cool, thanks! :)
[13:36:02] <rns> Kambfhase, do I escape like this? "#tenant_formset_//{{ forloop.counter }}_tabs"  ?
[13:36:30] <c0m> hmm
[13:37:35] <djQuery> c0m: too bad he doesnt appear to be implimenting a min max time
[13:38:12] <c0m> I tried changing the params but doesn't work
[13:38:23] <c0m> I'm probably doing something

[13:44:09] <djQuery> joshsmith: seeing as I dont have a fb account htat would be pretty hard
[13:44:21] <joshsmith> even better
[13:45:16] <SpinachHead> I have jquery externally loading along with several other jquery libraries and not sure why the other files are saying jQuery is not defined. I have had this problem before and forgot what the problem was....
[13:46:00] <devinrolsen> I'm stumped!! http://jsfiddle.net/rM3ej/4/ jQuery validation works great in all other browser except IE for no reason at all. Anyone see something I might have done wrong here?
[13:47:43] <jm2k> i am familiar how to create custom expressions, ut how can i return only the result/text from context without modifying the DOM? (ie:  title="Hey Dudes - I am Good"   .....  var $result = jQuery("title:split_by('-',1)").text()   where  $result == "I am Good"  ?
[13:48:29] <MoTiOnXml> omg
[13:48:36] <Brodingo_> lolwuttt
[13:48:40] <jm2k> ... i tried to do:   return e.text;
[13:50:12] <SpinachHead> you need commas after the required:true, ?
[13:50:13] <Brodingo_> dollar sign prefixed vars are usually to signify jquery objects so id fix that lest you confuse yourself, you'd want something like $(elem).attr('title').split('-')[1]
[13:50:39] <SpinachHead> IE is really sensitive for jquery.validate if a comma is missing
[13:51:00] <devinrolsen> SpiniachHead, uhh if I add a comma it will throw erros cause there is nothing proceeding the comma.
[13:51:01] <Kambfhase> SpinachHead: totally not true
[13:51:12] <devinrolsen> how me SpinachHead
[13:51:16] <devinrolsen> show*
[13:51:50] <SpinachHead> oh, I guess in that case you're right, but I remember one time I had a comma after an empty rules set and it worked in everything but IE, and then I removed the comma and IE worked
[13:52:11] <jm2k> heres a sample: http://jsfiddle.net/3qAer/
[13:52:14] <Kambfhase> that the complete opposite of what you just said
[13:53:08] <Brodingo_> jm2k check out the info tab on the side of jsfiddle
[13:53:16] <Brodingo_> thats how you set title and body tag
[13:53:28] <devinrolsen> yeah, you and 99.9% of all other IE jquery validation threads out there. I always seems to come down to an extra comma floating around.. but I don't have any in mine.. and I know for a fact it should be work..
[13:53:49] <devinrolsen> I think this is one of them cases where I am 100% sure everything is written right, but it just still fails.
[13:54:22] <jm2k> Brodingo_: thx
[13:54:51] <Kambfhase> devinrolsen: try updating your jQ version
[13:55:10] <devinrolsen> I have, again this is on http://jsfiddle.net/rM3ej/4/.
[13:56:17] <Kambfhase> jQ 1.4.4 ?
[13:57:43] <jm2k> devinrolsen: i think u forgot to add your validation extension code.
[13:57:55] <fabiobik> hi
[13:58:09] <fabiobik> hi
[13:58:12] <devinrolsen> no it's in there
[13:58:15] <devinrolsen> on the jsfiddler
[13:58:47] <Aristata> I have a select element  bound to variable "selection". Do I do selection.change(function(){}), or something different to pick up when it is changed?
[13:59:16] <fabiobik> http://programais.com/labs/php/detec/ on click on "PROBLEMAS NO ARRANQUE" shows the inside of div. but when i click in "O computador nao liga" dont appears the text of that title
[13:59:22] <fabiobik> can someone help me
[14:04:40] <Kambfhase> fabiobik: works for me
[14:05:01] <roddy> i'm trying to create a jsfiddly-thingy to demonstrate a problem, but am tackled by $( '<div>' ) being null on jsfiddle .. is this normal?
[14:05:06] <fabiobik> kambfhase when you click opens the content right?
[14:05:27] <Kambfhase> roddy: chose jQuery on the left!
[14:05:39] <Kambfhase> fabiobik: yes
[14:05:51] <roddy> Kambfhase: ha, how did I miss that.. thanks :}
[14:06:01] <Kambfhase> :) shit happens
[14:06:14] <fabiobik> kambfhase but when you click on title inside "O computador nao liga"  needs to open an text
[14:06:47] <Kambfhase> yeah, when i click "O computador nÃ£o liga" it shows "teste"
[14:16:23] <muzone> At http://www.asos.com - when you hover the Bag / Saved - how do you do that? I just made this dropdown menu - http://www.webdevout.net/test?02T&raw - do I just reuse that?
[14:17:24] <Cluber> when i include my jquery script in another .js file and include it on my page, my onclick event on my button doesn't work.
[14:21:15] <daum> hey guys - i'm usting jquery mobile however a lot of my JS keeps breaking since it is loading a new page which has the same 'ids' as the previous and the js that selects on the id breaks
[14:21:16] <daum> and suggestions?
[14:21:50] <webPragmatist> is it possible to "push" messages to the client instead of polling for a change/
[14:22:27] <systemfault> webPragmatist: It's called comet.. google for it
[14:23:14] <systemfault> It's hackish but heh..
[14:23:31] <kborchers> daum: my advice would be don't use the same id's but you might find better help on #jquerymobile
[14:23:50] <daum> ah tried jquery-mobile earlier
[14:28:08] <webPragmatist> systemfault: is this a decent way to sync something like a clock to the server?
[14:28:55] <roddy> before exposing you to the horror that is my jsfiddley-thing: is there a functional equivalent of the pseudo-code $( '.selector' ).live( 'change ready load', aFunction ) ? i.e., something jQueryish that will perform aFunction once on each element that matches the selector in present & future when it is loaded?
[14:28:55] <muzone> fucking hell i did it!!!!!!
[14:29:26] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0F - what y'all think y'all - my attempt at duplicating the www.asos.com "Bag / Saved" :D
[14:29:56] <muzone> did i get it right?
[14:30:03] <systemfault> webPragmatist: I would just poll.
[14:30:56] <webPragmatist> systemfault: my concern is that something weird might hapen
[14:31:09] <muzone> systemfault: would you recommend i use hoverintent on my dropdown menu / shopping bag?
[14:31:10] <webPragmatist> like it sends the request and it takes 5secs to get there then the clock is 5secs off
[14:31:33] <systemfault> roddy: Sure, just separate them with a space
[14:31:40] <systemfault> roddy: Like you did
[14:32:06] <roddy> systemfault: but they don't seem to fire
[14:32:23] <systemfault> webPragmatist: Perhaps you could actually time the transaction and correct
[14:32:42] <muzone> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[14:32:49] <roddy> couldn't find a list of allowed eventTypes on the documentation page for .live(), so I was hopeful - but it just doesn't do anything
[14:33:27] <systemfault> Ah
[14:33:40] <systemfault> Not that using live that way makes any sense..
[14:34:40] <xxiao> is it so true that jquery takes 47% of the js lib market?
[14:35:30] <xxiao> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript
[14:36:37] <muzone> nice numbers
[14:37:19] <snover> xxiao: no. lies, damn lies, statistics.
[14:37:47] <roddy> systemfault: hence the question whether there is a functional equivalent :}
[14:37:58] <snover> especially since it makes absolutely no sense to compare jquery to swfobject or jquery ui
[14:39:18] <ryanneufeld> http://imgur.com/plXQ4 anyone familiar with jquerymobile enough to tell me how to keep that button on the right hand side of the search box?
[14:40:14] <moo-_-> ryanneufeld: I think you can simply apply your own CSS formatting there
[14:40:23] <moo-_-> using floats or inline-blocks
[14:41:00] <wathek> Hi all
[14:41:44] <wathek> I got a problem I'm trying to get the value and the text of a select but I cannot see why my function isn't called here's my code :     $("#opt_marques_pneus").click(function() {   alert("salut");    });
[14:41:56] <wathek> my select ID is opt_marques_pneus
[14:42:15] <wathek> I don't get the alert
[14:43:08] <systemfault> wathek: Looks fine, the problem is probably somewhere else
[14:43:21] <wathek> systemfault, I tried using change and click
[14:43:22] <moo-_-> wathek: repeat the problem on jsfiddle.net
[14:43:30] <wathek> moo-_-, ok
[14:43:35] <moo-_-> otherwise trying to help you is like shooting in the dark
[14:43:40] <moo-_-> you just get victims :)
[14:43:54] * geekbuntu  *hmmmm, turns off lights*
[14:45:31] <wathek> moo-_-, ;)
[14:46:47] <djQuery> geekbuntu: finaly fingered out what I did wrong http://jsbin.com/uxenub/28/edit
[14:47:03] <djQuery> have no idea where my buttons are disapearing to though
[14:47:28] <geekbuntu> i'm looking djQuery - what was it?
[14:47:38] <wathek> moo-_-, it works well in jsfiddle
[14:47:55] <djQuery> geekbuntu: I had .link(scheme.Tables) instead of .link(scheme.Tables())
[14:47:58] <moo-_-> wathek: see, there is no problem then :)
[14:48:03] <moo-_-> wathek: the problem is somewhere else
[14:48:03] <wathek> yep
[14:48:06] <wathek> yes
[14:48:08] <geekbuntu> djQuery, what was confusing me was i would see a problem, then go look at his example and it was the same way
[14:48:12] <muzone> At http://www.webdevout.net/test?0G&raw - when you hover "My bag", why does the content get pushed to the left, and in some cases left endlessly flickering? I'm on Firefox 4.
[14:48:31] <geekbuntu> djQuery, leaving me to believe there is a 'different' application of tmpl in ui
[14:48:43] <geekbuntu> hover his bag?
[14:48:45] <geekbuntu> o.0
[14:48:54] <geekbuntu> as the hamster shoots out the back door
[14:48:56] <geekbuntu> o.0
[14:49:01] <muzone> geekbuntu: What?
[14:49:17] <geekbuntu> was trying to make sense of what you typed
[14:49:23] <geekbuntu> tlots of medicine here ;-)
[14:49:24] <djQuery> geekbuntu: muzone: geek is just fantasizing again
[14:49:44] <geekbuntu> djQuery, fantasy geek island
[14:50:06] <djQuery> geekbuntu: notice that in the tbltmpl I have span class="buttons"  some how that gets stripped in the output
[14:50:09] <geekbuntu> i' thinking they may be pushing ff5 too soon
[14:50:16] <geekbuntu> looking
[14:50:44] <djQuery> geekbuntu: damit didnt close ou the span correctly was all
[14:50:55] <geekbuntu> yikes
[14:51:14] <geekbuntu> it works now
[14:51:26] <muzone> how is this geek fantasy island like?
[14:51:38] <geekbuntu> http://jsbin.com/uxenub/28/edit#preview looks great man
[14:51:51] <geekbuntu> geek fantasy island has lots of liquor for ppl like paul irish
[14:51:58] <geekbuntu> hookas for ppl like 'normal'
[14:52:07] <geekbuntu> movies for the ppl who need to relax
[14:52:08] <muzone> haha
[14:52:18] <muzone> sounds like a nice island
[14:52:25] <geekbuntu> everytime i talk about paul irish he shows up
[14:52:29] <geekbuntu> :-D
[14:52:43] <geekbuntu> but he knows i still pray to him so it's all good
[14:52:47] * geekbuntu i hope
[14:52:47] <muzone> i am from the trobriands though - very hakuna matata - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0env3FI9Y0
[14:54:03] <geekbuntu> muzone, i will leave the page open - says this pc doesn't have flash on it (it did, but it says it needs to update)
[14:54:36] <djQuery> geekbuntu: http://jsbin.com/uxenub/30/edit
[14:55:00] <geekbuntu> djQuery, that is truly wicked man
[14:55:08] <djQuery> got the edit buttons show again
[14:55:15] <djQuery> now to code them
[14:55:16] <geekbuntu> did you notice a huge amount of difference between tmpl and applying it to the ui?
[14:55:22] <geekbuntu> it looks totally different
[14:55:22] <muzone> cool, i appreciate that geekbuntu
[14:55:33] <muzone> if you're into islands you're welcome to visit
[14:55:33] <geekbuntu> like a different plugin
[14:55:39] <muzone> we grow lots of weed here too
[14:55:44] <geekbuntu> if i win lotto i may move there
[14:55:49] <geekbuntu> i'll bring djquery with me too
[14:55:59] <geekbuntu> and a couple of hookas
[14:56:06] <geekbuntu> and a case of scotch and pual irish
[14:56:07] <geekbuntu> :-D
[14:56:11] <djQuery> geekbuntu: I am not ur date though so dont expect anything
[14:56:11] <muzone> lol
[14:56:21] <muzone> anytime just bring some for me too
[14:56:24] <geekbuntu> djQuery, i said we'z bring some hookas
[14:56:32] <geekbuntu> lol
[14:56:52] <geekbuntu> djQuery, answer ? above
[14:56:54] <geekbuntu> pls
[14:57:01] <geekbuntu> man this looks like a totally different plugin now
[14:57:05] <geekbuntu> is it because of the ui?
[14:57:15] <geekbuntu> all the extra included code/etc?
[15:05:04] <RobW> anyone know how to take a sidebar div and scroll it with the page (css equiv: position:fixed) but have top and bottom boundries?
[15:06:52] <RobW> nvm
[15:08:28] <geekbuntu> muzone, you still here?
[15:08:37] <geekbuntu> muzone, it does not flicker for me
[15:08:43] <geekbuntu> i'm on ff4 in ubuntu
[15:08:58] <geekbuntu> sorry 3.68
[15:09:53] <muzone> no problem mate all i needed was a position: absolute;
[15:10:06] <geekbuntu> ah - so you fixed it before i looked :-D
[15:10:56] <mephux> is there a way to get the height of a div before i add it to the dom?
[15:11:15] <mephux> like building html client side and making sure i have the right amount of space before i prepend or append?
[15:12:04] <geekbuntu> mephux, $('div#id_Name').height()
[15:12:09] <geekbuntu> should return the value in px's
[15:12:43] <mephux> geekbuntu: before its added to the dom.. example.. $('<div />').append(other_html_i_built);
[15:12:44] <geekbuntu> mephux, look at the example about 1/3 the way down this page http://api.jquery.com/height/
[15:12:54] <mephux> geekbuntu: it does not return a height .. just 0
[15:13:25] <geekbuntu> mephux, you may want to 'try' to bind to it -  it may be executed at the same time as the load/build of the div itself
[15:14:38] <geekbuntu> mephux, i do not know your code - so this is a pure shot in the dark o.0     event happens>>div is generated>>get height of div>>do some more stuff>>>
[15:15:00] <djQuery> mephux: no hieght if not added to dom yet
[15:15:14] <mephux> yea djQuery just saw a post on that
[15:15:16] <mephux> damn
[15:15:22] <geekbuntu> that's why i was suggesting not to read it until it's generated
[15:15:24] <geekbuntu> :-D
[15:15:38] <djQuery> mephux: hide it be setting the left to -9999999999999
[15:15:53] <djQuery> mephux: then get the hight
[15:16:04] <mephux> djQuery: well i need the height to know where to place it.. so that may work
[15:16:23] <mephux> djQuery: could i clone it then delete the clone?
[15:16:31] <mephux> .clone() get height.. remove?
[15:16:37] <djQuery> mephux: just clear the left
[15:16:42] <RobW> better question.. how would I set "boundries" for this: $(".side_nav_slide").stop().animate({"marginTop": ($(window).scrollTop() - $(".side_nav_slide").height() + 90) + "px"}, "slow" );
[15:16:45] <djQuery> why bother with all that cloning
[15:17:00] <geekbuntu> iono mephux has a damn good question
[15:17:31] <geekbuntu> cloning usually creates problems
[15:17:43] <mephux> ok i'll try that.. thanks geekbuntu and djQuery
[15:17:46] <geekbuntu> unless it's a straight read - like object before it's written for a local undo
[15:17:50] <mephux> left -9999 that is
[15:17:50] <geekbuntu> yw man
[15:18:01] <geekbuntu> djQuery saves the day again ;-)
[15:18:20] * djQuery but still has no karma
[15:18:56] * djQuery back to coding damn jsviews 
[15:22:01] <jtannenbaum> .click() adds a function that executes when an element is clicked. How do I remove all functions from that list?
[15:22:16] <Shyne> Can someone tell me why this slideshow doesn't load: http://newspg.net/news/news3.html | the div with the border is loading demo.txt
[15:22:17] <jtannenbaum> /clicked./clicked, unless I'm wrong.
[15:22:29] <jtannenbaum> s///s//
[15:22:41] <polyrhythmic> ?unbind
[15:22:41] <bot-t> .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[15:23:15] <jtannenbaum> the handler is the function?
[15:23:53] <polyrhythmic> jtannenbaum: yes, and unbind('click') would remove ALL click handlers
[15:24:02] <jtannenbaum> great, that's what I need, thanks
[15:24:04] <polyrhythmic> np
[15:25:08] <jtannenbaum> woo issue fixed
[15:45:01] <innociv>  I shouldn't put a value on a li, should I?
[15:45:08] <innociv> should I use rel instead?
[15:45:15] <muhdick> hi
[15:45:28] <muhdick> helllo
[15:45:39] <muhdick> i have a html document with a button
[15:45:48] <innociv> The value attribute of <li> is deprecated, and is not supported in HTML 4.01 Strict / XHTML 1.0 Strict DTD.
[15:45:51] <Hierofant> I have a belly with a button
[15:45:58] <muhdick> how can i stop the user from clickin on the button and doing  a post before the jquery is loaded
[15:46:09] <muhdick> is that even possible
[15:47:02] <muhdick> i mean
[15:47:05] <muhdick> do u guys know
[15:48:32] <muhdick> hey
[15:48:51] <muhdick> im talkin to u hierofant
[15:49:16] <muhdick> i mean innociv too
[15:49:59] <innociv> Ehh.  Why stop them if they can click that fast?
[15:50:05] <innociv> dom ready should only take a moment
[15:50:15] <Hierofant> muhdick bind the click handler to the button instead of using an html button.
[15:50:36] <muhdick> jquery cud still be loading on a slow connection
[15:51:03] <muhdick> i mean if u have a form with an action
[15:51:08] <AfroTurf> if i have a radio group witht the name=authorized how can i check if the 2nd one is checked, $("[name=authorized]").prop("checked") only works for the first one
[15:51:13] <muhdick> and u got <input type=Button
[15:51:16] <muhdick> wtf do u do
[15:52:07] <muhdick> what do u mean instead of an html button
[15:52:19] <AfroTurf> nvm i got it :eq() duh
[15:52:19] <muhdick> what does that suppose to me
[15:52:52] <muhdick> let's say...
[15:53:28] <muhdick> my button event which will be attached as soon as jquery library is fully loaded does something different than the form action...
[15:53:56] <muhdick> but it will be only attached and executed if jQuery is fully DOM ready
[15:54:22] <muhdick> what is a good practice to prevent the form action from executing?
[15:54:38] <muhdick> is it a good idea to not use a Form tag at all?
[15:54:56] <sarahh> how can I access a nearby input type="hidden" ?
[15:55:07] <muhdick> or maybe an empty action attribute?
[15:55:45] <bentruyman> muhdick: you want to prevent the form from being submitted?
[15:56:04] <muhdick> basically yes
[15:56:40] <bentruyman> not sure exactly what your'e trying to do, but you could try:
[15:56:41] <bentruyman> $('#my_form').submit(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[15:56:56] <muhdick> the same problem would occure if JavaScript is prevented from being executed at all (e.g. NoScript)
[15:57:17] <muhdick> thx bentruyman ...
[15:57:22] <muhdick> but the question was about
[15:57:28] <muhdick> if somebody hits the button
[15:57:34] <muhdick> before jQuery is ready
[15:58:10] <skiz> create the button after jquery is loaded
[15:58:14] <skiz> or show it
[15:58:16] <bentruyman> ah, well then could you just hide the form using CSS? then show the form when the page has loaded?
[15:58:42] <muhdick> thx guys...
[15:58:44] <muhdick> but:
[15:58:50] <dwarder> does Ajax() function exists in jquery, literally Ajax()
[15:58:56] <dwarder> sxist*
[15:59:00] <dwarder> exist*
[15:59:02] <skiz> $.ajax ?
[15:59:03] <muhdick> @skiz: isn't the HTML and scripts loaded asynchronously?
[15:59:27] <dwarder> skiz: i guess not, then i believe it is a custom one, and i need to fint it
[15:59:27] <skiz> muhdick: $(document).ready(function () { button.show })
[15:59:36] <dwarder> find*
[15:59:37] <skiz> dwarder: $.get and such?
[15:59:50] <skiz> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:59:53] <muhdick> sounds like a good idea..
[16:00:00] <muhdick> thx guys!!!!
[16:00:37] <bentruyman> skiz, muhdick you can't just hide the buton
[16:00:41] <bentruyman> button*
[16:00:49] <bentruyman> the user can still submit the form just using the keyboard
[16:01:03] <skiz> bentruyman: nobody said anything about a form ;)
[16:01:07] <skiz> (or I missed it)
[16:01:24] <bentruyman> i believe that's the issue muhdick was having
[16:01:34] <muhdick> you mean an ordinary POST?
[16:01:41] <muhdick> yeah, that is possible any time
[16:02:07] <muhdick> but maybe not using a form tag at all would not do a POST as well?
[16:02:52] <bentruyman> well if you don't need the form tag, then just remove it altogether
[16:03:04] <bentruyman> if jQuery is being used to handle everything
[16:03:23] <bentruyman> although you should probably provide a solution for those users without JavaScript
[16:03:35] <muhdick> yeah, true
[16:03:39] <muhdick> but i wonder..
[16:03:42] <muhdick> nowadays..
[16:03:47] <muhdick> who really does that?
[16:03:50] <dwarder> skiz: what do you mean, in a code i've found this onclick="Ajax('url_here', 'callback', 'some vars here')
[16:03:51] <muhdick> but you are right
[16:03:57] <bentruyman> muhdick: heh
[16:04:14] <bentruyman> muhdick: well I look at gawker, where a single JavaScript error took down all of their blogs :)
[16:04:15] <dwarder> skiz: is that the  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ ?
[16:04:33] <dwarder> skiz: or is that a custom func?
[16:04:35] <bentruyman> muhdick: because they provided no fallback
[16:04:42] <skiz> dwarder: look at the examples, it could be anything.
[16:04:48] <muhdick> well thanks suckers
[16:04:52] <muhdick> jp
[16:04:58] <dwarder> skiz: thanks
[16:06:44] <jtannenbaum> I'm trying to get an image so that when you click it, it pops up a window where you can upload an image and when you click "upload", it uploads it and the image on the original window changes to that new image. Is there anything in JQuery that can make that easier?
[16:06:54] <djQuery> $('
[16:08:08] <djQuery> $('form').submit(function(e){ if($(this).find('inputtype="submit"]:visible').length){ e.preventDefault();} });
[16:08:32] <djQuery> bentruyman: muhdick: ^^^^^^^^
[16:12:12] <mattalexx> Is there a good way to say "I'm setting this image's src attribute to a different value. Execute this callback function when the new image loads"
[16:14:30] <skiz> mattalexx:  $('#pic').load(function(){...})
[16:17:12] <execution> anyone want $20 to figure out how to make my arrow keys cause scroll.js (https://github.com/thomd/jquery-scroll) to scroll up and down?
[16:17:42] <execution> and by figure out i mean code
[16:20:07] <KWhat_Work> if I have $.each(children, function() { how can I tell if $(this) is the first element or not?  .is(:first) always returns true
[16:21:33] <roddy> KWhat_Work: $.each passes 2 arguments to its callback, index & value - so just replace it by $.each( children, function( index, el ) { var first = index == 0; } )
[16:22:00] <KWhat_Work> ahh that makes things alot easier, thanks roddy
[16:22:33] <sarahh> shouldn't this work for a button close to a input type hidden with class="post_id"  ------->  $(this).closest(".post_id").val()
[16:23:42] <necromancer> sarahh: .closest() goes up the DOM node tree, while .find() goes down
[16:24:29] <necromancer> sarahh: is .post_id a parent of $(this) or a child?
[16:25:25] <sarahh> necromancer, what happens when the button is on a table's row and the hidden is in the the same table but in another row?
[16:25:55] <necromancer> sarahh: you could try $(this).closest('table').find('.post_id')
[16:25:58] <necromancer> that should work
[16:26:10] <necromancer> it'll go up to <table> and then find the .post_id <button> somewhere in the table
[16:26:31] <necromancer> i like to do a "top-down" approach when traversing the DOM
[16:26:37] <necromancer> it just makes my life easier
[16:30:29] <sarahh> necromancer, worked, thanks
[16:44:19] <KWhat_Work> ehhh i just dont fuckign get it
[16:44:52] <KWhat_Work>  the only way i can get the border to be the same before and after ui-state-hover is to set a default border to not display
[16:44:59] <KWhat_Work> it keeps addign the extra width
[16:45:09] <erichynds> indeed
[16:57:51] <sarahh> necromancer, actually it didn't work
[16:58:04] <sarahh> necromancer, it always returns the same id
[17:08:38] <bhosie> What would be the reason that this -> http://pastebin.com/GZtW4PSG works, but this -> http://pastebin.com/ZbFUCQLF doesn't? Can I not set $.height() on a div? on line 7 of paste 2, i've tried "title" and ".title".
[17:15:07] <AfroTurf> $("a").click(function() { $(".formClass").prepend("something").submit(); } this should submit correct?
[17:15:43] <sarahh> <tr><td><input class="a"></td></tr><tr><td><input class="b"></td></tr> how can I access .b from .a?
[17:15:52] <AfroTurf> minus the sytax errors.
[17:17:45] <coldhead> ?submit
[17:17:46] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[17:18:01] <coldhead> sarahh: $('.a').find('.b')
[17:19:08] <sarahh> coldhead, ok but there are several .b's
[17:19:13] <AfroTurf> coldhead: it's not submitting though
[17:20:13] <coldhead> AfroTurf: does it work without the prepend() ?
[17:20:20] <AfroTurf> coldhead: 1 sec
[17:20:35] <coldhead> sarahh: that will select all of them for you -- do you just want the first?
[17:20:47] <coldhead> $('a').find('.b:first')
[17:20:55] <coldhead> or a bunch of other options
[17:21:02] <coldhead> ?selectors
[17:21:03] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[17:21:13] <AfroTurf> coldhead: no it doesn't
[17:21:26] <coldhead> AfroTurf: maybe the selector isn't matching anything?
[17:21:37] <coldhead> what about just $('form').submit()
[17:21:42] <AfroTurf> coldhead: prepend works if i do that by itself
[17:21:50] <coldhead> oh okay
[17:21:55] <coldhead> maybe the form html is borked
[17:22:07] <coldhead> does it submit when you click a submit button?
[17:22:12] <AfroTurf> coldhead: yes
[17:22:31] <coldhead> weirddd
[17:22:48] <AfroTurf> ya totally
[17:22:50] <sarahh> coldhead, i want the b below the a. they go in pairs, when I click an .a I need to find it's corresponding .b
[17:22:55] <AfroTurf> i've had this problem before
[17:24:27] <coldhead> oh okay, sorry sarahh
[17:24:38] <coldhead> you probably want $(this).find('.b')
[17:25:02] <coldhead> oh god no you don't
[17:25:13] <coldhead> they're not nesteed
[17:25:15] <coldhead> blergh
[17:26:04] <sarahh> coldhead, yeah
[17:26:08] <coldhead> AfroTurf: http://jsfiddle.net/VXEJW/2/
[17:26:11] <coldhead> that works
[17:26:29] <coldhead> AfroTurf: can you put your html and js in jsfiddle for us?
[17:26:36] <coldhead> sarahh: i'll do you a lil demo
[17:26:48] <AfroTurf> coldhead: ya give me a sec
[17:34:28] <coldhead> sarahh: http://jsfiddle.net/vDgdx/
[17:34:46] <coldhead> that's awkward because html tables expect you to group rows, not columns
[17:41:39] <coldhead> are we having fun yet?
[17:41:49] <sarahh> coldhead, i think it worked, :D
[17:42:11] <coldhead> oh good
[17:47:46] <Fandekasp> hi
[17:48:39] <coldhead> hi babe
[17:49:45] <Fandekasp> I've found several articles on how to do inheritance with javascript, but the ways to do it differ a little from one example to another. Is there a best practice when working with jquery ? I found a jquery-inheritance plugin, is it the best option ?
[17:51:00] <coldhead> it really depends what you're trying to do, Fandekasp
[17:51:08] <coldhead> you should use whatever makes sense to you
[17:51:29] <coldhead> lots of people just use Javascript's prototypal inheritacl
[17:51:38] <coldhead> inheritance*
[17:51:49] <coldhead> but if you find something you  prefer, sure, use that
[17:51:50] <Fandekasp> Yes that was my first idea as well..
[17:51:57] <Fandekasp> ok
[17:52:21] <coldhead> it's a contentious issue :)
[17:52:44] <coldhead> see also the various implementations of "klass" to bring classes to JS
[17:53:01] * coldhead spits on the floor
[17:55:24] <imsky> das..kapital
[17:57:33] <acidjazz>       $('.menu_buttons').css({background: "url('/img/menu_bottom.png');"});
[17:57:35] <acidjazz> that valid?
[17:58:09] <coldhead> not really
[17:58:20] <coldhead> it probably works
[17:58:38] <coldhead> but you should use 'background-image' if you're just setting an image
[17:58:51] <coldhead> background expects positioning and repeating args too
[17:59:05] <acidjazz>       $('.menu_buttons').css({'background-image': "url('/img/menu_bottom.png');"});
[17:59:08] <acidjazz> n obueno either way
[17:59:22] <coldhead> what are you seeing in firebug?
[17:59:29] <coldhead> is the CSS being changed?
[17:59:34] <sarahh> what could be crashing this? http://dpaste.com/561140/
[17:59:40] <sarahh> oops wrong channel
[17:59:47] <coldhead> oh hey you don't need to quote the stuff inside url(), acidjazz
[18:02:11] <acidjazz> ah that fixed it
[18:11:32] <Fandekasp> coldhead, I think that the extends method is the most jquery-like way of doing oop, isn't it ?
[18:15:00] <roddy> asked once before but now have jsfiddle to demonstrate: is there a way to have a function performed once on $( selector ) in present & future, like .live does? http://jsfiddle.net/a7E6Z/33/
[18:32:37] <RomD> oh, new google design
[19:26:20] * lazyPower yawns
[20:01:18] <Greed> $(this) is static, right?
[20:01:25] <wpsmith> Can anyone help me out with a jquery issue? http://bit.ly/jbU59i
[20:01:29] <Greed> For example,
[20:02:47] <Greed> After $("#foo") -> $(this).children("#bar"), while still in $("#foo")'s function would $(this) be the same value?
[20:03:01] <Greed> I guess what I'm asking is if $(this) ever changes when in the same scope
[20:05:18] <AfroTurf> is there a way to debug .submit() event
[20:13:36] <AfroTurf> $("form").prepend("<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"foo\" value=\"1\" />").submit(); <-- the prepend works, but the event won't trigger :/
[20:17:24] <djQuery> AfroTurf: would be a lot easier if you would use ' and "   '<input type="hidden" name="foo" value="1" />'
[20:17:57] <AfroTurf> djQuery: yes, but does the \" stop the event from triggering?
[20:18:11] <djQuery> AfroTurf: nopers
[20:18:32] <djQuery> just got here so all I saw was the line before my comment
[20:18:40] <AfroTurf> djQuery: when i click the <button type="submit" /> the form submits.. but when i use $("a").click(function() { $("form").submit(); }
[20:18:45] <AfroTurf> nada
[20:20:50] <AfroTurf> i don't know what the conditions are that it won't fire
[20:27:04] <AfroTurf> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/TWyqq/1/ won't even fire here
[20:27:31] <djQuery> pretty busy form
[20:27:50] <AfroTurf> ya
[20:28:05] <AfroTurf> no sytax error that i can see
[20:36:06] <vinmassaro> I am trying to capture an event on a select list. Using my macbook, when I click and hold on the trackpad and then let go on an item, this does not register as a click. How can I capture this?
[20:39:22] <AfroTurf> http://jsfiddle.net/TWyqq/2/ <-- this won't even fire submit
[20:41:09] <superjacaman> hey guys anyone has google+ invites?
[20:44:00] <VoiDeT> Is there a way to find an element at a particular x,y coordinate with jquery?
[20:44:18] <coldhead> VoiDeT: not easily
[20:44:32] <coldhead> nnot without checking every element in the DOM
[20:44:34] <AfroTurf> this doesn't submit when the <button type="submit"> is present http://jsfiddle.net/TWyqq/3/
[20:44:41] <VoiDeT> Traverse the dom and find the bounds hey
[20:44:45] <AfroTurf> it does when i remove it though.. why?
[20:45:15] <coldhead> the return false?
[20:45:29] <coldhead> oh that's for the <a>
[20:45:30] <coldhead> nm
[20:45:55] <AfroTurf> ya try it out.. take out the <button and it submits fine
[20:46:14] <AfroTurf> maybe cause i'm using name="submit"
[20:46:42] <AfroTurf> that was it!!!
[20:46:53] <coldhead> i just found that too :)
[20:46:58] <coldhead> how strange and terrible and annoying
[20:47:00] <AfroTurf> why is that though
[20:47:09] <coldhead> you must be very relieved, AfroTurf
[20:47:13] <AfroTurf> yes i am
[20:47:15] <AfroTurf> :)
[20:47:19] <coldhead> i don't know, and i don't want to know
[20:47:21] <coldhead> let it go
[20:47:24] <AfroTurf> lol
[20:47:25] <coldhead> move on with your life
[20:47:49] <wpsmith> anyone willing to walk through a simple jquery issue. first time using jquery
[20:48:17] <AfroTurf> it seems any attribute that you attach to an element that your going to fire .submit() on doesn't submit
[20:48:34] <AfroTurf> even id="submit"
[20:50:05] <coldhead> it's a known issue, AfroTurf, it rings a vague bell
[20:50:15] <AfroTurf> ah
[20:50:19] <coldhead> the take home lesson was never use the name "submit"
[20:50:24] <AfroTurf> well like you said.. move along
[20:50:30] <AfroTurf> yes
[20:50:40] <coldhead> yes exactly, for your own sanity
[20:50:51] <coldhead> let's hear it, wpsmith
[20:51:09] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery too
[20:51:18] <wpsmith> coldhead, the short of it is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6529534/jquery-show-hide-elements-based-on-selected-option-from-dropdown
[20:51:32] <wpsmith> however, I cannot get those jquery solutions to work
[20:51:34] <wpsmith> not sure what I've done wrong
[20:52:29] <superjacaman> hey coldhead
[20:52:48] <coldhead> hi superjacaman
[20:53:05] <juria_roberts> heyy why does console.log show me a window object when I clicked an anchor tag?
[20:53:17] <juria_roberts> shouldn't it be showing the anchor tag
[20:53:32] <coldhead> console.log WHAT
[20:53:47] <juria_roberts> console.log(this)
[20:54:09] <coldhead> inside a .click(function) it should show the <a>
[20:54:10] <coldhead> yes
[20:54:19] <juria_roberts> its not a click funtion
[20:54:30] <juria_roberts> the function is being called onclick
[20:54:32] <coldhead> but inside a href="javascript:etc"
[20:54:43] <coldhead> you are on a baffling nightmarish journey
[20:54:46] <coldhead> turn back!
[20:54:58] <coldhead> in that context this === window
[20:55:06] <juria_roberts> why?
[20:55:07] <coldhead> use the click()
[20:55:10] <coldhead> that's what it's there for
[20:55:12] <juria_roberts> I cant
[20:55:19] <juria_roberts> is there any other way?
[20:55:21] <coldhead> lol
[20:55:37] <superjacaman> why you can't?
[20:55:38] <coldhead> um there might be a way but it's not a jquery thing
[20:55:47] <coldhead> and i only know jquery
[20:55:58] <coldhead> onclick is so 80s
[20:56:08] <juria_roberts> im an old timer
[20:56:19] <superjacaman> coldhead lol
[20:56:20] <coldhead> i'm older'n you! and i embraced the future
[20:56:23] <coldhead> feels good man
[20:56:38] <juria_roberts> you got the wisdom that comes with age
[20:56:49] <juria_roberts> I got the drive and enthusiasm of youth
[20:57:19] <coldhead> youth invented click() and eschewed onclick
[20:57:29] <coldhead> i'm being gentle with you, juria_roberts
[20:57:48] <coldhead> my standard respoinse is "if you ever use onlcik again i will break every finger in your masturbation hand"
[20:57:55] <juria_roberts> :O
[20:57:56] <coldhead> but i'm not saying that in this instance
[20:58:02] <juria_roberts> :)
[20:58:03] <coldhead> so don't worry
[20:58:06] <juria_roberts> :D
[20:58:06] <madprops> if i change the value of an input button do I have to do something to refresh that value?
[20:58:23] <juria_roberts> ok i cant use click cause i wanna pass some parameters
[20:58:23] <coldhead> madprops: not if you change the value correctly!
[20:58:28] <coldhead> ?val @ madprops
[20:58:29] <bot-t1> madprops, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[20:58:48] <coldhead> juria_roberts: can you maybe use ?data // to set the params?
[20:58:48] <bot-t1> juria_roberts, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[20:59:04] <coldhead> assuming you need them set in the html
[20:59:32] <madprops> coldhead, im trying $(this).attr('value', 'like');
[20:59:45] <coldhead> that should work, madprops
[20:59:52] <coldhead> assuming this is what you think it is
[21:00:05] <coldhead> er actually no it shouldn't
[21:00:12] <coldhead> use $(this).val('like')
[21:00:16] <coldhead> be a cool guy
[21:00:51] <coldhead> wpsmith: i don't understand what is wrong with the solutions given on stack overflow
[21:01:34] <wpsmith> I don't think they are wrong. I am saying that my implementation of them is
[21:01:50] <juria_roberts> coldhead: cant i use an event object or sumthin?
[21:01:54] <coldhead> so why don't you use one of their working implementations?
[21:02:13] <coldhead> juria_roberts: maybe you can! try it and see?
[21:02:24] <coldhead> juria_roberts: i'll show you what i meant
[21:02:29] <juria_roberts> i dont know jquery :(
[21:02:31] <coldhead> one moment
[21:02:33] <juria_roberts> where do I look
[21:03:38] <juria_roberts> bot-t1: i always thot u were a bot
[21:03:39] <bot-t1> juria_roberts, Wednesday, 2011-05-25 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110525.log.html
[21:03:42] <coldhead> you just wait a moment
[21:03:59] <juria_roberts> coldhead: oki
[21:05:19] <coldhead> juria_roberts: http://jsfiddle.net/PHV6r/
[21:06:48] <juria_roberts> coldhead: hmm that could work
[21:07:01] <coldhead> it's supposed to!
[21:07:09] <coldhead> and nobody has any fingers broken <3
[21:07:25] <juria_roberts> i wonder how pirates masturbate?
[21:07:40] <juria_roberts> must be a pain with the hook
[21:07:47] <coldhead> very carefully?
[21:07:58] <coldhead> pirates use onclick
[21:08:10] <juria_roberts> dont be a dick,use onclick
[21:08:19] <superjacaman> lol
[21:09:00] <coldhead> THAT'S NOT THE LESSON, JURIA_ROBERTS
[21:09:04] <madprops> can I use $(this) in this contex http://jsfiddle.net/V5xwW/
[21:09:21] <madprops> if not how do I pass $(this) to the function?
[21:09:45] <wpsmith> coldhead, I've properly implemented them, but they don't work
[21:10:03] <coldhead> do you have a link or a demo, wpsmith ?
[21:10:06] <wpsmith> I've defined the css styles as display:none so that the initial setup is correct
[21:10:07] <superjacaman> use like this: var elem = $(this) and inside the $.get use elem like this
[21:10:30] <wpsmith> here's a dev site: link: http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-admin/upload.php?page=wp-accordion username: guest pw: Password1/
[21:11:55] <wpsmith> coldhead the js is in http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-content/themes/genesis/lib/js/admin.js
[21:12:09] <coldhead> thanks doc
[21:12:29] <coldhead> wordpress is telling me You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.
[21:12:35] <wpsmith> http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-content/plugins/wp-accordion/js/admin.js
[21:12:38] <wpsmith> ok, 1 sec
[21:12:49] <superjacaman> madprops understand my last msg?
[21:13:10] <wpsmith> coldhead refresh
[21:13:38] <madprops> superjacaman, yep thanks
[21:13:50] <superjacaman> =]
[21:14:04] <coldhead> this is crazy complicated, wpsmith !
[21:14:25] <wpsmith> thanks
[21:14:29] <wpsmith> I guess?
[21:15:11] <wpsmith> though coldhead I don't think u meant it as a compliment
[21:15:12] <wpsmith> ?
[21:15:37] <wpsmith> stuff under Hyperlink/Page ID is what I want to work right
[21:15:41] <coldhead> you're brave to try this? :)
[21:15:57] <coldhead> the page is throwing a JS error on line 1 of admin.js
[21:16:01] <coldhead> i am trying to work out why
[21:18:54] <wpsmith> coldhead does it need to start like: jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[21:19:07] <coldhead> that looks right to me
[21:19:15] <coldhead> that's why i don't unnerstan
[21:19:41] <coldhead> http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries#Overriding_the_.24-function
[21:19:48] <coldhead> try that maybe?
[21:20:00] <wpsmith> coldhead, I got it working now
[21:20:17] <coldhead> good job!
[21:20:18] <wpsmith> refresh
[21:20:25] <wpsmith> don't really know what I did and why
[21:20:27] <wpsmith> but it works
[21:20:38] <wpsmith> how do I add a little bit of sliding?
[21:21:01] <coldhead> wait so everything else you asked on stack overflow is all good in the hood now?
[21:21:07] <wpsmith> so show() with a slide
[21:21:12] <wpsmith> yes coldhead
[21:21:14] <coldhead> ?slidetoggle
[21:21:14] <bot-t1> .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[21:21:20] <coldhead> ?slideup

[21:21:26] <coldhead> good job
[21:21:30] <coldhead> i'm going to lunch
[21:21:31] <wpsmith> so instead of show
[21:21:34] <wpsmith> use slidedown?
[21:21:41] <coldhead> yup!
[21:21:41] <wpsmith> ok bye coldhead
[21:21:45] <wpsmith> ok ty
[21:29:54] <madprops> if i change the attr('class') of an input button, will that button respond to .click events set to that class?
[21:33:41] <AfroTurf> if i do $("a").click(function() { $(this).unbind("click"); //after i run some code $(this).bind("click"); <-- i want to rebind the same event
[21:34:05] <AfroTurf> with out doing var = function() { $("a").click(........ }
[21:34:34] <abjorn> http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/6/29/ All this strip needs to be 100% based in fact is for all of them to be incredibly pissed off.
[21:34:34] <bot-t1> (5 hours 8 mins 10 secs ago) <imsky> tell abjorn wiggle that monitor a few times
[21:34:37] <Cork> AfroTurf: can't be done
[21:34:53] <AfroTurf> Cork: so use a function to rebind
[21:35:01] <AfroTurf> is the only way
[21:35:08] <djQuery> coldhead: finaly got jsviews workin http://jsbin.com/uxenub/30/edit
[21:35:16] <Cork> AfroTurf: you could set a variable at the top of your function and return early if your not complete
[21:36:15] <djQuery> AfroTurf: see ?once
[21:36:16] <bot-t1> AfroTurf, $(...).once(); | jQuery Plugins - Filters out all elements that had the same filter applied on them before. It can be used to ensure that a function is only applied once to an element. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once
[21:36:20] <AfroTurf> i was hoping i could get some properties of the event
[21:36:29] <Cork> AfroTurf: (function() { if($(this).data('pending')) { return; } $(this).data('pending', true); <your code>; $(this).removeData('pending'); });
[21:37:52] <AfroTurf> Cork: i'll give it a go.. thanks!
[21:37:59] <djQuery> or cache var $this = $(this);
[21:38:01] <Cork> np
[21:38:36] <Cork> djQuery: its just a code example, its not meant to be implemented exactly like that
[21:38:51] <djQuery> Cork: yeah.
[21:40:23] <AfroTurf> Cork: ya i like that better then unbinding and rebinding :)
[21:41:40] <Cork> AfroTurf: i find it easier to follow what it does if nothing else
[21:44:14] <djQuery> AfroTurf: Cork: have done the same thing with delegate before .delegate('button.active', 'click', fucntion(e){ var $this = $(this).removeClass('active'); do stuff  $this.addClass('active'); });
[21:50:15] <rzen> I'm working on a simple jquery add/remove feature for form elements, and i want my remove link to apply to the element it's paired with (instead of the last added to the list)
[21:50:39] <rzen> what's the trick i need to make my jquery recognize this newly added item in the DOM?
[21:51:12] <Cork> rzen: the dom doesn't have a consept of newly added
[21:51:26] <rzen> t'was my fear
[21:51:43] <Cork> it has dom hierarchy thats it
[21:51:52] <Cork> parent, children and siblings
[21:52:16] <rzen> surely there's some way for me to make this "Remove" link target it's parent, though?
[21:52:31] <Cork> sure
[21:52:36] <rzen> even though the link + it's parent were inserted via ajax
[21:52:38] <Cork> $(this).parent()
[21:53:07] <Cork> or replace this with a selector or what ever you use
[21:53:09] <wpsmith> coldhead ping
[21:53:23] <djQuery> rzen: see ?.live
[21:53:24] <bot-t1> rzen, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[21:53:44] <rzen> ah, perfect
[21:53:51] <rzen> thanks djQuery
[21:54:16] <rzen> BAH! I was already using .live for another similar function earlier in my code
[21:54:18] <rzen> noobsauce
[21:54:33] <djQuery> rzen: TMI
[21:54:46] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to select an <option> that has a certain label? For example $('option[value="1"]')  would select <option value="1">Test</option>  but how do I select the option that has "Test" as its label/content?
[21:55:30] <djQuery> timwis: .attr('selected', true) see ?attr
[21:55:31] <bot-t1> timwis, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[21:56:00] <djQuery> ah timwis see ?contains
[21:56:00] <bot-t1> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[21:57:12] <Cork> timwis: note though, that its better to use class or id on the options, as :contains is a really slow selector
[21:57:15] <djQuery> timwis: might run into issues if more than one has test in it though. in which case you would want to do .filter
[21:59:05] <timwis> thanks. trying to get it working now
[22:00:19] <coldhead> wpsmith: pong?
[22:01:16] <wpsmith> coldhead, I need a unique identifier
[22:01:26] <wpsmith> selecting on one reveals on all
[22:01:59] <coldhead> link me to the JS again
[22:05:16] <coldhead> no?
[22:05:23] <coldhead> perhaps you want to use ?index
[22:05:23] <bot-t1> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[22:05:47] <wpsmith> coldhead: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6529534/jquery-show-hide-elements-based-on-selected-option-from-dropdown
[22:05:48] <coldhead> so you can can match the nth thing-A with the nth thing-B
[22:06:15] <wpsmith> coldhead link: http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-admin/upload.php?page=wp-accordion username: guest pw: Password1/
[22:07:37] <coldhead> wpsmith: $(".link-pages", this)
[22:07:45] <coldhead> no wait
[22:07:46] <timwis> Got it, thanks
[22:08:00] <wpsmith> ok
[22:08:28] <coldhead> $(this).parent().next().find('.link-pages')
[22:08:57] <coldhead> use that pattern to find the elements to show/hide
[22:08:59] <coldhead> capiche?
[22:09:36] <coldhead> or i guess just for the slideDowns, you can hide all of them
[22:10:46] <coldhead> nice butterfly, btw
[22:13:23] <wpsmith> coldhead where does that code go in admin.js?
[22:16:43] <coldhead> let me just rewrite it for you huh
[22:17:28] <wpsmith> coldhead, that would be awesome!
[22:17:53] <dr0id> this is awesome -> http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mel45efdk/mark-zuckerbergs-backyard#content
[22:18:05] <coldhead> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/424511/
[22:18:08] <coldhead> something like that
[22:24:44] <wpsmith> coldhead I see the js doing something in firebug but display:none is not changing
[22:26:38] <coldhead> mark zuckerberg's house is stupid
[22:27:13] <wpsmith> coldhead, it's not executing show(); it locates it though
[22:27:18] <coldhead> wpsmith: http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/tomatopie/wp-content/plugins/wp-accordion/js/admin.js?ver=3.1.3
[22:27:27] <coldhead> that code looks the same to me
[22:27:36] <wpsmith> uploading
[22:28:06] <wpsmith> refresh
[22:29:07] <wpsmith> sorry coldhead...appreciate your time in helping me
[22:29:39] <coldhead> ah okay
[22:30:00] <coldhead> i misread your markup
[22:31:48] <samlander> hey guys
[22:31:48] <coldhead> wpsmith: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/424525/424511/
[22:31:54] <samlander> have some advice to ask
[22:31:56] <coldhead> hey salamander
[22:31:59] <samlander> hi :)
[22:32:35] <samlander> im trying to parse some json from here: http://mtgox.com/code/data/ticker.php
[22:32:54] <samlander> only thing is it's spazzing out probably because the expected type is wrong..
[22:33:29] <samlander> is it possible to do a webrequest type thing to get the data first into a var and then feed it into .getJSON ?
[22:34:03] <execution> anyone want $20 via paypal to help me make arrow keys trigger the scroll up/down events of this lean jquery scroll class? --> https://github.com/thomd/jquery-scroll
[22:34:27] <misterm> samlander: define "spazzing out", is it throwing an error?
[22:34:40] <samlander> it does nothing
[22:35:06] <misterm> no errors?
[22:35:45] <misterm> samlander: can you put up a jsfiddle or pastebin of your code?
[22:35:57] <wpsmith> coldhead a modified version worked
[22:36:02] <wpsmith> ty
[22:36:12] <coldhead> it IS your site :)
[22:36:45] <samlander> www.pastebin.com ?
[22:37:18] <misterm> samlander: sure, or a jsfiddle is nice
[22:37:39] <misterm> samlander: how are you getting the JSON?
[22:37:47] <samlander> http://pastebin.com/BdLgaCjD
[22:37:49] <coldhead> ?json2
[22:37:49] <bot-t1> Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)
[22:38:15] <samlander> tasty, thanks coldhead
[22:38:24] <coldhead> samlander: if you can get the code JSON you can use JSON.parse to extract it anyold when
[22:38:35] <coldhead> what strange syntax
[22:39:18] <samlander> hm?
[22:39:23] <coldhead> wpsmith: you shouldn't need to use all the nextAll crap for the ones you're hiding
[22:39:32] <niftylettuce> any alternative to [Hotlink to Test](#test) ... <h1><a id="test">Test</a></h1> in Markdown/Github syntax???
[22:39:37] <coldhead> because you can safely hide ALL .link-pages
[22:39:43] <coldhead> even the ones that are already hidden
[22:39:46] <coldhead> it don't matter
[22:39:51] <context-> anyone know why this would not work: $('tr:last input.activator, tr:last select.activator', $('tbody.replicator'))
[22:39:53] <coldhead> unless i'm wrong
[22:39:58] <coldhead> in which case i[m sorry
[22:40:02] <coldhead> thanks for playing
[22:40:04] <coldhead> TIME FOR bEER
[22:40:06] <context-> the selector itself works, but when the selectfield changes the live() function never gets called
[22:40:11] <wpsmith> coldhead, yes it hides the others
[22:40:25] <wpsmith> so if one selects page and the other selects posts
[22:40:26] <samlander> coldhead: my syntax is odd?
[22:40:29] <wpsmith> then problem
[22:40:51] <coldhead> sorry samlander , i was referring to my own english
[22:41:01] <context-> err im a dork
[22:41:02] <coldhead> good work, wpsmith
[22:41:02] <samlander> mm k
[22:41:09] <context-> $('tr:last input.activator, tr:last select.activator', $('tbody.replicator')).live('click', function(ev) {...}
[22:41:23] <coldhead> can i also just draw your attention to the fact that #jQuery has a user called SpecialEmily ?
[22:41:28] <coldhead> thanks, tab completion
[22:41:35] <context-> the selector itself works, and if i just do .change(...) it works also
[22:41:42] <context-> but the live does not get called
[22:42:24] <coldhead> live('click') doesn't work? are you sure you're clicking?
[22:42:31] <context-> ... change
[22:42:35] <context-> ive tried click and change
[22:42:44] <context-> .change(...) works. not .live('change', ...)
[22:42:49] <coldhead> change is a bit fruity
[22:43:04] <coldhead> it didn't work in some browsers, back in the day
[22:43:10] <context-> this is chrome
[22:43:11] <coldhead> i thought they fixed it but i donno
[22:43:13] <context-> and firefox 5
[22:43:24] <context-> i think they are new enough :x
[22:43:26] <coldhead> do you need to use .live() ?
[22:43:40] <coldhead> you can't just do bind() when you add the new content?
[22:43:50] <context-> hmmm
[22:43:52] <samlander> http://www.adeepersilence.be/archive/jquerys-getjson-with-php
[22:43:53] <coldhead> i'm suggesting a lazy workaround
[22:43:56] <samlander> thanks guys
[22:43:58] <coldhead> but it should work huh
[22:44:04] <context-> if i remove the tr:last it works
[22:44:07] <coldhead> bye forever, salamander
[22:44:10] <context-> but... thats gonna not do what i want
[22:44:40] <coldhead> context-: remove the :last and then inside your function test if $(this).is(':last')
[22:44:45] <coldhead> and return immediately if not
[22:44:55] <context-> that'll work :/
[22:44:59] <context-> this /use/ to work
[22:44:59] <coldhead> or whatever you need it to do
[22:45:01] <context-> in another project
[22:45:11] <coldhead> yes well it's all very gomblicated isn;t it
[22:45:19] <coldhead> i used to work when i had a job
[22:45:24] <coldhead> and now look at me
[22:45:29] <VoiDeT> :D
[22:45:38] <coldhead> DON'T LOOK AT ME
[22:45:41] <coldhead> I'M HIDEOUS
[22:45:50] * VoiDeT pats coldhead 
[22:46:26] <context-> and that dont work :/
[22:47:08] <coldhead> goddamn
[22:47:31] <coldhead> this whole thing is making me very tired
[22:47:33] <context-> oh wait
[22:47:40] <coldhead> AND ANGRY
[22:47:47] <context-> if (last) != if (!last) sorry
[22:48:07] <context-> still no :/
[22:48:15] <context-> still works if its the not last tr
[22:48:57] <coldhead> ?p @ context-
[22:48:58] <bot-t1> context-, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:49:03] <coldhead> you must be doon it wrong
[22:49:44] <coldhead> oh you know what?
[22:49:54] <coldhead> is(:last) will always return true
[22:50:02] <coldhead> if it's the only elem
[22:50:06] <coldhead> you need something like
[22:50:25] <coldhead> if ($(this).nextAll('tr').length != 0)
[22:50:27] <coldhead> capiche?
[22:51:38] <context-> http://jsfiddle.net/zkj3T/
[22:52:02] <context-> well.... why did tr:last USE to work with live() and now it doesn't
[22:52:15] <coldhead> i don't know
[22:52:24] <coldhead> i am deeply ignorant of many things
[22:52:32] <coldhead> like how it feels to make love to a woman
[22:52:39] <context-> heh. i appreciate the help ;)
[22:52:52] <coldhead> also i thought 'change' only worked for inputs
[22:52:57] <coldhead> not tbodys
[22:53:33] <context-> uhh
[22:53:46] <context-> its not attached to a tbody
[22:54:20] <coldhead> no YOU'RE not attached to a tbody
[22:54:24] <coldhead> I HATE THIS GAME
[22:54:25] <context-> ok.
[22:54:34] <context-> i do too but i DID figure it out
[22:54:38] <context-> WHY i dont know
[22:54:41] <context-> i should read change logs
[22:54:54] <context-> apparently last NOW is not the last THEN
[22:54:59] <context-> last-child NOW is the last THEN
[22:55:09] <coldhead> <_<
[22:55:50] <context-> there is only 1 :last tr in a tbody
[22:55:52] <context-> so WTF !
