[00:54:08] <VectorX> hi in the firefox dev tools, how can i see functions attached to an element similar to Event Listners in chrome
[00:56:57] <VectorX> hello
[01:23:23] <Cork> VectorX: should prob have been a better question for #firefox
[01:23:35] <Cork> but you have (env) bubbles in the dom view
[01:23:37] <Cork> click that
[01:23:42] <VectorX> ok ty
[01:48:13] <AcidRain> hello. in jquery, how do i access an element of an array of an array
[01:49:12] <AcidRain> hmmm
[01:49:15] <AcidRain> appears my structure is wrong
[02:00:47] <AcidRain> so security question
[02:00:55] <AcidRain> what is the javascript equivalent to htmlentities() in php?
[02:01:19] <AcidRain> if i send jquery an htmlentities(); string, will it be entities'ed in jquery?
[02:03:25] <AcidRain> oh wait. im thinking too deeply
[02:05:29] <Cork> AcidRain: there isn't really a way to safely escape html you inject with javascript
[02:05:46] <Cork> AcidRain: the solution if you need that is to build dom objects directly instead of parsing html
[02:06:06] <AcidRain> thx
[02:23:54] <AcidRain> what are those custom fields on an element called?
[02:23:59] <AcidRain> been so long since i seen them
[02:24:10] <AcidRain> its like.... data-zomg=""
[02:24:13] <AcidRain> is it data fields?
[03:56:47] <fxx> is there a more elegant way than this: $('#id').first().each(function() {}) ?
[03:58:01] <Resourceful> fxx, if you have an id - then you know there will be only one result - so why use first()
[03:59:19] <fxx> Resourceful: browser makes sure there are no identical ids?
[03:59:58] <Resourceful> fxx, you should only have one id with a given name per page, use a class
[04:02:11] <fxx> Resourceful: I'm writing a greasemonkey script, I have no control of source, but probably it is safe to assume that ids are unique, right?
[04:03:03] <Resourceful> fxx, yes
[04:04:36] <fxx> Resourceful: thanks :)
[04:05:05] <VectorX> fxx you can look at the code and see if its unique, that would be the sure way to do it, but your code doesnt really do anything, in english: from all the #id's give me the first, then run this function on all of the elements which have the id #id which you only have one of
[04:06:03] <VectorX> if you give the url and what you are trying to do maybe someone can help
[04:12:49] <fxx> VectorX: I'm not sure whether by 'doesnt really do anything' you mean that function is empty or that first() isn't needed
[04:13:19] <Resourceful> fxx, he means that there would be only one id on the page so there is no need for first and the loop - since you won't have anything to loop over
[04:14:05] <fxx> Resourceful: I need to run a function on that element, I didn't find any other way to do it conveniently
[04:14:27] <arc_> you can define a function and then use it like you would with any other method
[04:15:20] <fxx> arc_: that function modifies innerHTML, ie it's run only a single time
[04:16:21] <arc_> so why can't you use one of the existing methods that modifies innerhtml
[04:17:17] <arc_> basically we're having to guess at what you're trying to do because you haven't showed us any code
[04:18:53] <fxx> arc_: it's rather long, 100+ lines and nothing of interest, at the begining it gets innerHTML manipulates it and reasigns back at the end
[04:20:18] <arc_> well if we can't see your code, all i can really say is that one way to run a function on a selector is to define a function
[04:21:32] <arc_> either way, you don't need first() in the line you wrote
[04:22:10] <arc_> even if a page erroneously has some non-unique ids, the browser will only return the first one when you select by id
[04:24:58] <fxx> arc_: thanks :) I modify about 15 different elements, each with it's own function, some I have to select with td:contents(), in that case first() will make sense :)
[04:27:26] <fxx> first().each() doesn't look great to me, but first() doesn't support arguments, so...
[04:27:47] <km4> hi
[04:28:14] <km4> I have this string "Orange Tail" and I need display only "OT" for this
[04:28:22] <km4> how to split this ?
[04:28:53] <arc_> i assume you mean you want to remove lowercase and spaces to turn something into an abbreviation
[04:28:57] <arc_> not just only that specific string
[04:30:26] <km4> ok I have txt.split(" ") >> text2 and text2[0][0] text2[1][0]
[04:31:42] <fxx> km4: always 2 words?
[04:34:55] <km4> fxx: I guess
[04:36:51] <fxx> km4: so do you want first letters of any number of words or do you want all uppercase letters from a string?
[04:39:35] <fxx> km4: imo unless you always have exactly same format you should make a function which does what you need, otherwise you can use some regex
[04:39:52] <Xatenev> regex ftw
[04:39:53] <Xatenev> one sec
[04:40:12] <Xatenev> probably osmething like this: test.replace(/([a-z]*)/g, '').replace(' ', '').trim();
[04:40:27] <Xatenev> would work prob
[04:41:22] <fxx> Xatenev: yeah, unless he wants first letters, ie "Tail of Tiger" to "ToT"
[04:41:32] <Xatenev> he said two words.
[04:41:48] <km4> fxx: first letter is fine
[04:55:44] <fxx> km4: I googled up this: .match(/\b\w/g).join('')
[05:00:28] <hellyeah> hey
[05:00:43] <hellyeah> is it ppossible to use jquery datepicker and moment.js together?
[05:01:59] <fxx> km4: if you only want first letters which are uppercase: 'House of Cards'.match(/\b[A-Z]/g).join('') will produce 'HC'
[05:31:48] <jquery888> Hi, I wounder if someone can see why I cant get to see next step -> https://jsfiddle.net/zvzomL8a/1/
[05:40:15] <jquery888> I want to make to show next tab in tab and so on ---> https://jsfiddle.net/zvzomL8a/1/
[05:40:55] <jquery888> I can show first step to step2 ,, but now step3 and so on
[05:41:04] <jquery888> not*
[06:03:01] <decx> your html is messed up
[06:03:15] <decx> step2 and 3 and children of eqprime
[06:03:19] <decx> are*
[06:14:20] <Trioxin> how would I hide a div in a page loaded in an iframe by id?
[06:14:38] <decx> depends if the iframe is interal or external
[06:14:50] <Trioxin> browser security off
[06:14:55] <Trioxin> using nwjs
[06:15:10] <decx> contents()
[06:15:16] <hellyeah> hey there
[06:16:07] <Trioxin> decx, $('#iframe').contents().find('#divid').hide(); ?
[06:16:26] <decx> that'll do
[06:16:38] <Trioxin> thx
[06:17:04] <Trioxin> decx, out of curiosity what would that be in common js?
[06:17:45] <decx> a mess
[06:20:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:23:22] <hellyeah> does it override the datepicker's date style http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/34/
[06:26:32] <Trioxin> to do getelementsbyclassname('someclass')[0] would it just be $('#xframe')[0] ?
[06:27:04] <Trioxin> actually...
[06:27:09] <Trioxin> it's within an iframe
[06:27:31] <Trioxin> $('#xframe').contents().find('#someclass')[0].hide(); ?
[06:27:50] <decx> the element doesnt have a hide method
[06:27:56] <hellyeah> hey line 2-7 avoid datepicker to show that anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/35/
[06:27:59] <Uhkis> why would you give some element an id "someclass"? ;-)
[06:28:15] <Trioxin> it doesn't have an id, just a class on it
[06:28:19] <Trioxin> it's remote
[06:28:33] <Trioxin> browser security is off in node-webkit
[06:28:45] <Uhkis> #someclass is selector for id="someclass" ;-)
[06:29:42] <Trioxin> Uhkis, how would I do it by the first instance of the usage of that class as in JS getElementsByClassName?
[06:30:06] <decx> eq()
[06:31:00] <Uhkis> .get() returns the non-jquery element
[06:31:25] <decx> the hide() method tells me that ne non jquery element isnt wanted
[06:31:40] <Trioxin> can I combine jquery and javascript? like $('#xframe').contents().getElementsByClassName("mod-nav")[0].style.display = "none";
[06:31:51] <decx> why?
[06:31:58] <decx> also, no
[06:31:59] <Uhkis> jquery is javascript, you always combine those :P
[06:32:00] <decx> but why
[06:32:41] <Trioxin> trying to not learn I suppose. okay I'll lookup eq and get
[06:32:42] <Resourceful> Trioxin, if you use [0] (index) you get a JavaScript value
[06:33:26] <Resourceful> thereafter, you cannot chain jQuery methods - what you can do is call $(el[0]) all over again or use vanilla jhs
[06:33:29] <Resourceful> js*
[06:33:46] <Resourceful> instead of [0] you can do .eq(0)
[06:35:04] <Resourceful> > $('#xframe').contents().find('.someclass').eq(0).hide();
[06:44:09] <niknickolas> hello
[06:46:32] <niknickolas> <div id="item" selected="123123">text</div>
[06:46:59] <niknickolas> console.log($('#item').attr('selected'));
[06:47:06] <niknickolas> console.log(document.getElementById('item').getAttribute('selected'));
[06:48:14] <niknickolas> why jquery method attr () does not do same as getAttribute()
[06:51:30] <hellyeah> hey i try to use moment.js with jquery datepicker. Why datepickers for me to select current date http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/36/ an y idea?_
[06:58:52] <hellyeah> hey no one here
[07:01:04] <decx> selected isnt a valid attribute for a div
[07:03:46] <hellyeah> decx: do you know about datepickers?
[07:04:04] <decx> i'm not gonna read your 250 line fiddle bra
[07:09:03] <hellyeah> decx: short example http://jsfiddle.net/x7ezuekb/1/
[07:10:09] <decx> and`?
[07:10:51] <hellyeah> hmm when you click datepicker it didnt show the dates  nut stackoveflow question stated that i worked.
[07:10:53] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24500726/replace-the-jquery-datepicker-dateformat-with-momentjs-parsing-and-format
[07:11:50] <hellyeah> do you have any idea?
[07:12:57] <decx> you dont go changing library methods willy nilly
[07:13:06] <decx> parseDate doesnt get a value
[07:13:08] <hellyeah> willy nilly?
[07:13:43] <decx> why would you need moment for this anyway
[07:13:43] <hellyeah> then answer is wrong? how can ii fix it?
[07:13:53] <hellyeah> hmm just wondering
[07:13:59] <hellyeah> just try to learn stuff
[07:14:26] <hellyeah> people sugggest me using moment.js for date issues
[07:14:56] <decx> you can still use moment after you get the right data from datepicker
[07:15:03] <decx> no need to change basic library functions
[07:15:28] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:15:38] <hellyeah> ic
[07:15:47] <hellyeah> so i dont need that lines?
[07:16:02] <decx> probably not
[07:16:39] <hellyeah> if i want to change that how can i fix that any ideas?
[07:16:49] <decx> change what=
[07:17:04] <hellyeah> date format
[07:17:13] <decx> how's it supposed to be
[07:18:10] <hellyeah> question meantioned that but aanyway http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24500726/replace-the-jquery-datepicker-dateformat-with-momentjs-parsing-and-format :p
[07:19:14] <hellyeah> forget it
[07:19:27] <hellyeah> what about this usage? http://jsfiddle.net/x7ezuekb/2/
[07:20:35] <decx> that's probably failing silently and falling back to the default format
[07:21:17] <hellyeah> well
[07:21:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:21:29] <hellyeah> are you sure abouÄ±t that?
[07:21:40] <hellyeah> what was the default date format of datepicker
[07:21:44] <hellyeah> wait a sec
[07:21:52] <decx> remove the format property to find out :p
[07:22:06] <hellyeah> i show you smt else
[07:22:11] <hellyeah> to prove you are wrong
[07:22:28] <decx> this is gonna be good
[07:22:42] <hellyeah> check this out http://jsfiddle.net/x7ezuekb/3/
[07:23:22] <decx> so what this returns now
[07:24:12] <hellyeah> i guess date and time together plus timezone
[07:24:49] <decx> dateformat will just handle that as a string
[07:25:00] <decx> same as it would if you did dateFormat: 'hnnnng'
[07:26:10] <hellyeah> ic
[07:26:21] <hellyeah> but at least there is no failling back
[07:26:23] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:30:51] <Voyage> I am in the third TD of a TR. I want to get the href value of <a href> in the first TD.
[07:31:01] <Voyage> what should be the syntax
[07:31:35] <decx> .closest('tr').children().eq(0).find('a').eq(0).prop('href')
[07:32:32] <decx> if you are directly on the td and not a child you can also to .siblings().eq(0)...
[07:34:55] <Voyage> $(this).parent().closest('tr') ?
[07:35:36] <Voyage> $(this).parent().closest('tr').children().eq(0).find('a').eq(0).prop('href') ?
[07:37:18] <decx> you dont need parent
[07:37:35] <decx> closest will go up the tree until it hits a fitting element
[07:51:32] <hellyeah> what about closest('tr').find('a')
[08:33:40] <ismithers> Can anyone suggest a good plugin that handles a list of items (returned from a web-service) and applies pagination controls to them?
[08:53:37] <kassav_> hello, need some help on qunitjs
[08:54:04] <kassav_> which code need unit test and which doesn't need
[08:57:13] <WilsonG> Hi, i have cachedd some selectors, and now i need to change css of them, without caching vars i would just write $('.one, .two').css({}) etc. but how to do it with cached vars? I can't do like : $one.$two.css({});
[08:58:53] <Voyage> Is this valid code?  $('#txtarea-result').prepend('<pre><code class="xml hljs">');       for <textarea id="txtarea-result"> </textarea>
[09:16:08] <shoky> WilsonG: $one.add($two).css(...)
[09:22:03] <taplar_busy> Voyage: i'd probably put the closing tags to be explicit
[09:22:15] <taplar_busy> otherwise it has to guess your intended nesting
[09:22:38] <taplar_busy> it's going to be appending/prepending dom elements, not just the text
[09:25:14] <decx> you want wrap()
[09:40:17] <_TWG_> I've got an array of items.  Most of them have repeat names.  How can I remove the duplicates?
[09:40:19] <Voyage> taplar_busy,  hm
[09:40:27] <Voyage> taplar_busy,  is this valid $('#txtarea-result').html( vkbeautify.xml($('#txtarea-result').html())  );
[09:40:49] <taplar_busy> i'm not familiar with xml()
[09:50:24] <relipse2> I have a hidden div, how do i slide down and show it, for some reason slideDown() is not doing it?
[09:57:25] <_TWG_> Is there an easy way to sort an array in a promise?
[09:58:14] <taplar_busy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[10:01:33] <relipse2> does parentsUntil() do what I think it does?
[10:02:34] <relipse2> i havea a <div class="A"><div class="B"><a></div></div>, but when i do $('a').click(function(){ $(this).parentsUntil('.A'); }); it returns div.B
[10:03:27] <relipse2> i think i want .closest()
[10:17:42] <Xatenev> relipse2: The resulting jQuery object contains all of the ancestors up to but not including the one matched by theÂ .parentsUntil()Â selector.
[10:17:56] <relipse2> yeah lol i noticed
[10:17:57] <relipse2> thanks
[10:20:51] <relipse2> I have a weird problem, I am doing a .slideUp() and then after its done i'm doing a .css('height', '325px') (changing from height: auto), so it is sliding up, but then "bouncing down" to 325px. Is there a way to avoid this?
[10:21:23] <relipse2> if I change the height FIRST then it looks terrible as the content breaks out of the div
[10:22:44] <relipse2> is it possible for the slideUp() to stop at 325px?
[10:23:24] <relipse2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8247341/how-to-make-slideup-stop-at-acertain-height
[10:23:30] <relipse2> that might work
[10:45:35] <AcidRain> what do i gotta do to make jquery fire events on newly created elements after page load?
[10:45:48] <taplar_busy> bind to them or a parent
[11:11:10] <nonconvergent> Hey guys, help me out with something? I had somestuff that worked fine, then I wrapped it in a form tag and now a change() event isn't triggering. https://jsfiddle.net/u3vdfp4g/
[11:11:41] <nonconvergent> If I comment out the form, I get my change. If I don't, it doesn't trigger.
[11:13:16] <nonconvergent> The point of the lines 4-6 is that I have three buttons. dummyBrowse is what the user sees, hiddenbrowse is the input type=file button that dummyBrowse clicks, and Upload is going to be what submits the form, but I also have some stuff in there so the text on the button says what the file is.
[11:14:29] <nonconvergent> The change event on line 8 that enabled the Upload button and copies the filename to it doesn't trigger on browse and file select as soon as I add the form tag.
[11:24:06] <AcidRain> .bind() to newly created elements does not work
[11:24:55] <taplar_busy> i wasn't meaning bind() verbatum
[11:24:58] <taplar_busy> use on()
[11:25:08] <AcidRain> could have sworn i alrdy tried that
[11:25:10] <AcidRain> let me try again
[11:25:44] <taplar_busy> the point is you have to either attach the event handler to the elements after they've been inserted to the dom (if your going to look them up), or attach them when you have a reference to them, or delegate bind to a pre-existing parent ahead of time
[11:26:33] <AcidRain> so this is wrong? : $(".delete_part").on( "click", function() { });
[11:29:11] <taplar_busy> looks fine, provided those element exist in the dom at that point
[11:29:28] <AcidRain> all .delete_part classes are created after page load
[11:29:38] <taplar_busy> so they don't exist yet?
[11:29:40] <AcidRain> however, #participants is available at page load.
[11:29:49] <AcidRain> that also doesnt fire
[11:30:03] <AcidRain> if i do $("#participants a")
[11:30:15] <taplar_busy> do delete_part belong to participants?
[11:30:20] <AcidRain> yes sir
[11:30:28] <taplar_busy> ok, so delegate bind off of that
[11:30:43] <AcidRain> #participants .delete_par?
[11:30:51] <taplar_busy> $('#participants').on('click', '.delete_part', function(){});
[11:31:10] <taplar_busy> and only do that once
[11:31:34] <AcidRain> wow amazing
[11:31:36] <taplar_busy> you understand that bindings belong to elements right?
[11:31:47] <taplar_busy> $('.class') is a lookup to find elements
[11:31:53] <taplar_busy> if it doesn't exist, you can't bind to it
[11:32:03] <AcidRain> i was just about to say. i guess thats what the documentation was trying to explain to me ;)
[11:32:24] <taplar_busy> event handlers are attached to elements
[11:32:32] <taplar_busy> you look them up and put the handlers on them
[11:33:00] <taplar_busy> no future changes to the elements that were referenced by that lookup will mater
[11:33:05] <taplar_busy> it's already attached to them
[11:33:23] <taplar_busy> further more, new ones will not be affected.  they were not around when that selector happened and the event was attached
[11:33:47] <taplar_busy> the selector isn't a magical seperate thing that sits out there referencing all the now and future elements, ::)
[11:34:03] <AcidRain> nice alien smiley
[11:34:09] <taplar_busy> typo, :(
[11:34:15] <AcidRain> :P
[11:34:15] <taplar_busy> anyway, delegates are a way around that
[11:34:32] <taplar_busy> all that still applies to the element you attach the delegate binding to
[11:34:39] <taplar_busy> but it relies on the fact that events bubble
[11:35:08] <taplar_busy> so events originating from a child bubble to the parent, and it checks to see if it originated from what ever child you are concerned about
[11:35:12] <taplar_busy> if so, it executes it
[11:35:24] <taplar_busy> since it's based off of the event bubbling, it doesn't care when the child was created
[11:35:27] <nonconvergent> I'm sorry, did anyone respond to me?
[11:35:30] <taplar_busy> only that it exists to make the event
[11:36:15] <taplar_busy> clear as mud? :)
[11:36:33] <nonconvergent> taplar_busy: was that for me?
[11:36:38] <taplar_busy> no, for acid
[11:36:41] <nonconvergent> oh.
[11:36:49] <nonconvergent> sad face
[11:38:38] <AcidRain> taplar_busy, ok. i was actually firing events on "a" .delete_part of #participants.  which didnt work. but i realized it was just extra code since all "a"s inside of #participants would be captured anyways, i just removed the .delete_part
[11:38:53] <AcidRain> BUT, if it did want to do #participants .delete_part a
[11:38:57] <AcidRain> what is the syntax
[11:39:41] <taplar_busy> $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, eventHandler)
[11:40:07] <AcidRain> so it is indeed: $("#participants").on( "click", "a .delete_part", function() {
[11:40:14] <taplar_busy> :)
[11:40:21] <AcidRain> i tried that. and it wouldnt fire
[11:40:31] <nonconvergent> Well, to restate, I don't know why adding a form like so causes the on change event handler I define in this to no longer trigger when I click on dummyBrowse and input a file. https://jsfiddle.net/u3vdfp4g/1/
[11:40:48] <nonconvergent> It works fine if I ditch the form tag.
[11:41:14] <taplar_busy> 'a .delete_part' looks for anchor tags that have a descendent with a class of 'delete_part'.
[11:41:17] <taplar_busy> is that correct?
[11:41:53] <AcidRain> in desperation i also tried .delete_part a
[11:41:58] <shoky> nonconvergent: try  type="button" on your <button>
[11:42:16] <NotHere> why many people enclose their code inside $(function() { ... });? What's the purpose of this?
[11:42:30] <AcidRain> so hold up. what is the point of using anything else besides .on() ?
[11:42:30] <taplar_busy> it's a doc ready and also scopes down the variables
[11:42:32] <shoky> NotHere:  that's a shortcut to  $(document).ready(...)
[11:42:40] <NotHere> thanks shoky
[11:42:57] <taplar_busy> AcidRain: bind() existed before on() i believe
[11:42:58] <nonconvergent> shoky: which button? there are three.
[11:43:14] <nonconvergent> NotHere: shorthand for what shoky said
[11:43:14] <AcidRain> taplar_busy, so what did we do before on() existed?
[11:43:22] <taplar_busy> bind()
[11:43:27] <AcidRain> oh they are the same thing?
[11:43:31] <shoky> nonconvergent: i only see one <button>
[11:43:37] <taplar_busy> gah, your gonna get me lying
[11:43:44] <taplar_busy> i think now days bind() is a wrapper for on()
[11:43:53] <AcidRain> hehehe
[11:44:03] <AcidRain> kk, thx for the help man
[11:44:10] <taplar_busy> same with click(), resize(), scroll(), etc
[11:44:17] <taplar_busy> they wrap on()
[11:44:20] <nonconvergent> shoky: boostrap makes that anchor look like a button also.
[11:44:35] <shoky> nonconvergent: i'm only referring to the <button> :)
[11:44:42] <nonconvergent> shoky: and the input type=file is that ugly browse button I can't style.
[11:45:25] <nonconvergent> shoky: That worked!
[11:45:36] <nonconvergent> ...that's stupid that I need to do that, but it worked
[11:45:46] <nonconvergent> shoky: Thank you!
[11:45:50] <shoky> nonconvergent: yay. it's because a <button> inside a <form>  is by default a submit button unless you give it a different type
[11:46:27] <nonconvergent> Oh. yeah, the <a> in the form is going to trigger some js that will validate them submit.
[11:55:33] <AcidRain> i rly need to learn how to use jsfiddle
[11:56:58] <nonconvergent> AcidRain: Html goes here, javascript goes there, css over there, and add any libs you want like bootstrap or jquery over to the left.
[11:57:14] <AcidRain> ye one would think it was that ez lol
[11:57:21] <nonconvergent> Boom, you now nknow how to use jsfiddle!
[11:57:32] <Uhkis> nonconvergent: you do realize he can't see your finger? :)
[11:57:45] <AcidRain> fancy gui
[11:58:17] <Uhkis> and the libs are now behind the javascript button
[12:05:41] <jorvis> I want to iterate over an array of xhr results to add repeated content on my page using a template.  I don't see an official JQuery template plugin, but lots of discussion about them.  Is there a favorite?
[12:06:58] <Jordy> jquery selectors does not work at PHP generated content?
[12:07:12] <bango2> should Jordy
[12:07:21] <bango2> php is prehypertext
[12:07:33] <bango2> so jquery runs and sees the dom after php does its magic
[12:07:59] <bango2> hypertext preprocessor rather
[12:08:00] <NoiseEee> Jordy: if you have valid html you should have no issues w/ jquery
[12:08:06] <NoiseEee> Jordy: maybe explain your issue a bit further
[12:08:18] <Jordy> Ok
[12:08:42] <Jordy> Let me jsfiddle
[12:10:45] <Jordy> wait nvm, I see what I did wrong. thanks tho :P
[12:24:39] <chrisml> wizards: how can i select 5 elements that have the class .comment.hidden ?

[12:37:46] <persina> I'm stumpped...why does the hover work but not the click()? https://bpaste.net/show/2af71f63a9dc
[12:44:19] <shoky> persina: jquery doesn't really support SVG if that's what you're doing
[12:45:05] <persina> shoky: It works when I trigger from the dev console though
[12:45:54] <shoky> persina: when you trigger what
[12:46:30] <persina> shoky: When I trigger the .click() from the dev console it works. When I click it on the page it doesn't fire. Hover works on both.
[12:46:48] <shoky> just cause calling click() works doesn't mean jquery supports SVG
[12:47:05] <Looney> I am using slider
[12:47:24] <Looney> I want to slide the second marker on basis of delta
[12:47:34] <raul782> hi guys, so I have this value in a select that I want to extract,  value = "data with 12.50:12.50:0.00:id"
[12:47:34] <raul782> I've tried this, $(myselect).val().match(/:[0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}/) but it only works if I delete the semicolon, but I want to extract the second value
[12:47:42] <Looney> I am using slide function
[12:48:07] <persina> shoky: What does that mean? Obv if it works form the console it should work from the webpage. The both using the same jquery and svg.
[12:48:14] <Looney> I can modify ui.value[1] or ui.value[0]
[12:48:20] <shoky> persina: what's obvious about that?  obviously it doesn't work :)
[12:48:32] <Looney> but marker doesn't seem to be moving  :'(
[12:49:09] <shoky> persina: it means jquery doesn't do anything special to deal with the SVG DOM which is differnt than the regular DOM, and needs to be dealt with differently in many cases
[12:49:53] <shoky> persina: https://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/#svg-vml-or-namespaced-elements-bugs
[12:50:26] <persina> shoky: Why would hover work but click not work? Why would it work when firing from the dev console?
[12:51:17] <shoky> persina: i don't know the precise reasons. but these types of behaviours are expected when trying to do something non-supported
[12:51:33] <shoky> i definitely don't know the reasons without an actual testcase
[12:52:19] <shoky> persina: and firing from the console is totally different than firing the real event with the mouse. it affects tons of things differently
[12:52:31] <shoky> and with SVG, who knows what else it does differently
[12:52:55] <shoky> firing from the console could be equivalent to just calling the click handler function
[12:53:15] <shoky> so, calling a function works.  triggering an event handler based on a click event doesn't. 2 totally differnt thing
[12:53:16] <shoky> things
[13:06:20] <persina> shoky: click should work according to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11701461/attach-events-to-svg-paths
[13:07:49] <NoiseEee> persina: make a better js fiddle, with the SVG.
[13:29:25] <DelphiWorld> yo all
[13:29:55] <DelphiWorld> is it pocible to add a item to a list using jquery?
[13:30:03] <DelphiWorld> <ul></ul>
[13:33:00] <shoky> yes
[13:33:22] <DelphiWorld> shoky: would be glad if you tel me?
[13:33:37] <shoky> you can use .append for example
[13:33:53] <DelphiWorld> shoky: coolio;)
[13:34:05] <DelphiWorld> shoky: what about a multi select list, is it pocible to delete selected items?
[13:35:28] <shoky> DelphiWorld: yes e.g. .find(':selected').remove()
[13:35:32] <persina> If anyone can solve the problem of why this click() event never gets fired I will be gratefull :) here is the fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/ojadbpsa/2/
[13:35:49] <DelphiWorld> shoky:  thank you a lot dude
[13:42:46] <bango2> persina for starters, js should go in the javascript box on jsfiddle
[13:43:23] <persina> bango2: Ik, couldn't figure out how to link it in though, sorry about that.
[13:44:04] <bango2> here it is how it should be
[13:44:04] <bango2> https://jsfiddle.net/ojadbpsa/3/
[13:44:11] <bango2> havent looked into the click yet
[13:44:33] <persina> bango2: No, but now the hover doesn't work.
[13:45:13] <persina> bango2: When you hover over the legend in mine--notice the lines on the graph.  In yours it doesn't work.
[13:46:03] <bango2> where is that hover functionality being called
[13:46:08] <bango2> give me something to "find"
[13:46:41] <bango2> $(this).hover(function () ??
[13:47:40] <bango2> brb
[13:48:29] <persina> bango2: $(this).hover(function () {
[13:48:43] <persina> bango2: It's at the bottom of the file
[13:54:59] <storix_> Design question - I’m converting a web app from loading pages to dynamic page content. The JS for each page now conflicts because they get loaded and stay in memory. Before I put in a ton of unbinds, how have others solved this issue?
[13:55:57] <storix_> .on and .off are options, but I'm thinking about best practices.
[13:56:48] <bango2> persina im not seeing any elements with class mpld3-path
[13:56:55] <bango2> youre selecting the first one to perform those functions
[13:57:03] <Uhkis> storix_: what kind of js is there
[13:57:08] <taplar_busy> storix_ delegate bindings, bind closer to the dynamic content
[13:58:02] <bango2> im seeing them now
[13:58:17] <storix_> Uhkis, query. Certain selectors are conflicting
[13:59:10] <taplar_busy> storix_: so you have multiple selectors which select different things?
[13:59:22] <taplar_busy> *different types of things
[13:59:31] <storix_> taplar_busy, I have polling going on that needs to stop too
[14:00:01] <taplar_busy> it's always a good idea to have your selectors be descriptive of what they reference
[14:01:10] <storix_> taplar_busy, I was hoping for the reverse of getScript. Something to unload the entire script no matter what is in it.
[14:01:29] <taplar_busy> uh, doesn't exist as far as i know
[14:02:01] <taplar_busy> which is why you bind close to your targets.  removal of the elements that you bind on effectively undoes the bindings
[14:02:14] <taplar_busy> and it's more contextual anyway
[14:03:09] <taplar_busy> the whole 'undo' everything is sometimes why you see people putting their entire page in like a <div id="container"> and binding on that.
[14:03:17] <taplar_busy> remove that and recreate it, all bindings gone
[14:04:54] <persina> bango2: They are there inside the svg
[14:05:19] <storix_> taplar_busy, so if I understand. Add a page-specific class to all DOM elements for each page and select accordingly?
[14:05:49] <taplar_busy> are you trying to do a SPA?
[14:06:03] <persina> bango2: It's wierd because the hover works fine but the click doesnt work.  And their both targeting the exact same elements.
[14:06:24] <bango2> yes i see that
[14:07:03] <persina> bango2: Do you think this is a bug jquery? 0.0
[14:07:13] <bango2> thats a leap
[14:08:01] <persina> bango2: Maybe a bug in how jquery triggers events on path elements?
[14:08:51] <bango2> assuming its a bug in jquery is the wrong thing to do
[14:10:08] <persina> bango2: Maybe file a bug report and see where that goes?
[14:10:20] <bango2> do whatever you want im still trying to help you
[14:10:59] <persina> bango2: Oh okay, thanks!  I've asked in #d3.js and #javascript. Nobody seems to be able to crack it :p
[14:15:35] <bango2> persina, in chrome console, putting in $('.mpld3-path') returns null
[14:15:42] <bango2> let alone $('.mpld3-path')[0]
[14:16:54] <bango2> but anyway, i would try delegated events instead of calling individual click functions over and over
[14:17:48] <bango2> delegated as in, $(document).on('click', '.mpld3-path', function(){console.log('here')});
[14:18:36] <bango2> outside the each loop, so even dynamically generated content can have a click function assigned without explicitly assigning it a click function of its own
[14:20:30] <persina> bango2: I've tried that, it still doesn't work. I agree it is better like that but it's not an explanantion for why it woulsn't work.
[14:21:41] <bango2> this guy is using jquery with path elements and click function
[14:21:42] <bango2> http://jsfiddle.net/TmsrP/1/
[14:22:55] <persina> bango2: Yea, I saw that. Just not sure what I'm doing wrong here...
[14:24:36] <taplar_busy> persina: what part are you supposed to be able to click?
[14:25:14] <persina> taplar_busy: use this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/ojadbpsa/2/ and click the lines in the legend
[14:25:56] <taplar_busy> ic
[14:26:49] <persina> taplar_busy: The hover works, but the click has no responce.
[14:28:14] <bango2> haha well i can call this.click right after i add the click event handler
[14:28:22] <bango2> and i get 8 'here's
[14:30:47] <persina> bango2: This is such wierd behavior, right?! what is going on lol
[14:32:06] <bango2> have you tried adding mousedown event listener
[14:32:44] <persina> bango2: No, but doesn't click() use the mousedown listner?
[14:33:55] <persina> bango2: mousedown works!
[14:34:08] <bango2> oohrah
[14:34:14] <persina> bango2: I'm so confused...
[14:35:22] <bango2> i blame obama
[14:35:32] <taplar_busy> i wonder if click isn't a valid thing for those
[14:35:46] <taplar_busy> i mean i attached it directly to the element with this.onclick = function and still nada
[14:35:49] <bango2> i linked a working fiddle
[14:35:53] <persina> taplar_busy: It is though, look here: http://jsfiddle.net/TmsrP/1/
[14:36:20] <bango2> different fiddle, but it was a jquery click function on an svg path
[14:38:33] <taplar_busy> that fiddle is telling me a missing ;
[14:39:12] <bango2> semicolons are optional though
[14:40:14] <taplar_busy> ok, yeah that's weird
[14:43:13] <persina> taplar_busy: change "click" to "mousedown" and it will work
[14:43:45] <persina> And btw i submitted an issue to d3.js and they blame jquery :p https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/2726
[14:45:02] <arc_> i disagree with your assessment of his comment
[14:45:23] <arc_> he basically just said they don't support jquery, which is understandable
[14:45:30] <taplar_busy> i agree with the statement that it needs a reduced test case
[14:46:09] <SmashingX> Does someone know how can I collapse a jquery collapsible using a button like in my example? https://jsfiddle.net/h6ctdrw0/
[14:46:38] <persina> arc_: But jquery/js support DOM manipulation so it really is more of a jquery issue.
[14:46:54] <persina> taplar_busy: I can try and make a reduced test case.
[14:48:15] <arc_> the question is, is it a jquery issue, or a jquery+d3 issue, or something you're missing
[14:49:46] <persina> arc_: Alright, I guess I can post to StackOverflow and see what happens.
[14:52:09] * DelphiWorld back
[14:52:18] <DelphiWorld> let's say i have a text input
[14:53:13] <DelphiWorld> <input type="text" id="mail" placeholder="Email">
[14:53:23] <DelphiWorld> how to take the text value using js?
[14:53:25] <DelphiWorld> mail.val?
[14:53:45] <taplar_busy> document.getElementById('mail').value
[14:54:02] <_test_> dang your quick taplar_busy
[14:54:31] <bango2> $('#mail').val() if were using jquery ;)
[14:54:31] <taplar_busy> DOM Elements use .value.  jQuery maps to it with val()
[14:55:47] <DelphiWorld> brb 5min
[14:56:23] <arc_> persina using firequery i can see that d3.min.js has a mousedown event for path elements
[14:56:31] <arc_> if i disable that, your click event works
[14:56:38] <arc_> as i suspected
[14:56:48] <taplar_busy> so the mousedown is preventing default?
[14:56:54] <arc_> it must be
[14:57:00] <arc_> i can't really see it because it's minified
[14:58:01] <persina> arc_: I tried event.preventDefault() to prevent the default behavior but it didn't work either
[14:58:50] <bango2> maybe you needed to stoppropogation
[14:59:50] <arc_> preventDefault isn't going to do anything in this case because the click event is never firing because there is a mousedown event firing before it that is preventing default
[15:00:02] <bango2> i added the solution and reasoning to your github issue, even though its closed.
[15:00:48] <SmashingX> Does someone know how can I collapse a jquery collapsible using a button like in my example? https://jsfiddle.net/h6ctdrw0/
[15:01:56] <persina> bango2: stoppropogation didn't work either.
[15:02:19] <persina> arc_: How did you disable it?
[15:02:24] <bango2> yes it wouldnt becuase mousedown is stopping the click function from even being called
[15:03:06] <taplar_busy> SmashingX: i don't see a collapsible on jqueryui.  I see an accordion.  did you mean jquery mobile?
[15:03:16] <persina> bango2: Ahh, that makes sense. Why is there even a default set on mousedown for path elements?
[15:03:20] <arc_> persina firequery lets you just click a button to disable any event
[15:03:28] <SmashingX> yeah sorry taplar_busy jquery mobile
[15:03:29] <bango2> its a d3 thing, not something i would know
[15:04:02] <taplar_busy> SmashingX: http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/
[15:04:06] <arc_> i highly recommend it as an addon if you are going to be using jquery a lot
[15:04:13] <persina> arc_: Why does this click work then? http://jsfiddle.net/TmsrP/1/
[15:04:32] <SmashingX> taplar_busy: I already read that
[15:04:56] <arc_> persina well ... this isn't d3, is it?
[15:05:00] <taplar_busy> ok... ?
[15:06:02] <persina> arc_: Ahh i see.
[15:06:11] <choosegoose> hi all, if I call jQuery on an existing jQuery object, it just returns the object, right? like $('body') has the same result as $($('body'))
[15:06:36] <Uhkis> why would you do that?
[15:06:51] <choosegoose> I'm writing a function that takes either a selector or a jquery object and setting obj = $(obj);
[15:07:22] <Uhkis> typeof?
[15:07:37] <choosegoose> I started with typeof, maybe it's better programming
[15:07:49] <taplar_busy> you should check that it's a string, but really in that case i'd just stick it in the $()
[15:07:53] <taplar_busy> *could
[15:08:42] <decx> btw whoever does whatever with d3.js (the discussion goes back too far to find out): d3 has its own on() method
[15:08:57] <arc_> :)
[15:09:01] <arc_> that would explain it
[15:09:07] <decx> whenever you create a new thing you can chain .on
[15:09:28] <arc_> and why the dev talked about event bindings using jquery as if there were a d3 alternative
[15:09:32] <decx> like append('path').attr('fill', ...).attr('d', arc).on(...)
[15:10:06] <decx> and then do whatever with your dataset
[15:10:09] <decx> in that function
[15:10:09] <arc_> persina sounds like you should read up about how you're supposed to bind events in d3
[15:11:47] <persina> arc_: There supposed to be bindeable using pure jquery as well.
[15:11:49] <bango2> haha we werent playing with the full deck
[15:13:35] <arc_> persina well obviously they weren't intending you to do this, don't really know what else to say about it
[15:14:13] <decx> svg events dont bubble up, so you're better off doing it in d3
[15:14:41] <arc_> ah, so maybe they weren't preventing default
[15:14:44] <taplar_busy> so much diablo...
[15:14:54] <arc_> :p
[15:17:58] <nikola_> hi i am trying to delete plugin with delete $.fn.pluginname , i get an error missing name after . operator , any help? thanks
[15:23:17] <taplar_busy> delete $.fn.pluginname; ?
[15:27:32] <persina> arc_: Weird because it doesn't work with their own d3 syntax either.
[15:28:28] <DelphiWorld> SUP back
[15:28:47] <taplar_busy> 5 minutes my ...
[15:29:07] <DelphiWorld> <input id="mail" type="text" placeholder="EMAIL">

[15:29:29] <DelphiWorld> alert (document.getElementById('mail').value);
[15:29:36] <DelphiWorld> why am i getting empty message in alert?
[15:29:42] <taplar_busy> why wouldn't it be?
[15:29:58] <DelphiWorld> taplar_busy: cause i put value in the text?
[15:31:10] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/x3gpozcr/
[15:31:16] <persina> arc_ bango2: Using only d3 syntax: https://jsfiddle.net/ojadbpsa/7/
[15:31:32] <DelphiWorld> taplar_busy: you forget me maybe? feedle dont work for screen reader;)
[15:31:48] <taplar_busy> huh?
[15:31:58] <DelphiWorld> taplar_busy: this link is for me?
[15:32:01] <taplar_busy> yep
[15:32:02] <arup_r> Can we call `.ready()` method on any DOM element ?
[15:32:06] <DelphiWorld> i can't use jsfeedle due to text to speech usage
[15:32:15] <taplar_busy> oh
[15:32:16] <taplar_busy> hmm
[15:32:21] <taplar_busy> what works for you?
[15:32:24] <DelphiWorld> taplar_busy: i am blind...
[15:32:29] <DelphiWorld> using text to speech screen reader
[15:32:52] <DelphiWorld> taplar_busy: hold on
[15:32:53] <_test_> Can anyone tell me why this is not adding items to my table? http://kopy.io/Igea6#nuen0PSVjlvapy
[15:33:16] <taplar_busy> well the fiddle i linked had what you were trying to do with the alert in a delay for 5 seconds.  i can type in it and it alerts the text after the 5 seconds.
[15:33:57] <arc_> persina well i guess then that you can post this as an issue on d3 github
[15:34:20] <taplar_busy> guess he left
[15:34:33] <decx> i dont see an issue
[15:34:38] <persina> arc_: Isn't this like basic D3 functionality? Must be doing something wrong...
[15:34:39] <decx> anything is done by that mpld3.v0.3git.js file
[15:34:46] <decx> everything*
[15:34:55] <arc_> i don't know. i don't know d3
[15:35:08] * DelphiWorld is back
[15:35:16] <persina> decx: mpld3 just converts to d3
[15:35:16] <decx> if you cant extend that then you have to make your own graph and legend which is super easy
[15:35:31] <decx> the mpl builds the graph
[15:35:34] <taplar_busy> DelphiWorld: hey i'm all new with this so should I make sure to put your name in my comment to help your screen reader?
[15:35:42] <persina> decx: yes, so?
[15:35:43] <decx> and there you have your references to attach events
[15:36:02] <decx> i have no idea what else this mpl thing does
[15:36:03] <persina> decx: That's what I'm trying to do
[15:36:14] <decx> for a simple graph you just need a dataset and some d3 chaining
[15:36:35] <persina> decx: scroll to the bottom where I'm trying to target the click event: .on("click", function () {
[15:37:43] <arup_r> Can we call `.ready()` method on any DOM element ?
[15:38:03] <taplar_busy> arup_r: what are you trying to do?
[15:38:15] <taplar_busy> ready is usually associated with the window or document
[15:38:23] <taplar_busy> and probably iframes
[15:38:38] <arup_r> when a form is visible, some js i want to execute
[15:39:00] <arup_r> form is coming to the dom using Ajax
[15:39:17] <taplar_busy> ok, so after the ajax puts the form on the page, execute the other js
[15:40:03] <arup_r> hm true
[15:40:39] <taplar_busy> :)
[16:07:06] <Gasher> Hi, what is a good JQuery book? Something for a reader preferably.
[16:08:06] <taplar_busy> not books, but have you read over try.jquery.com and learn.jquery.com ?
[16:08:44] <Gasher> First one yes, second one no.
[16:08:52] <Gasher> I just like to read books since they are super well written.
[16:11:31] <taplar_busy> i'm partial to O'Reilly books.  i'm sure they have at least one
[16:17:41] <SpecialTechnique> Is there a reason why it clone()'s all instead of the children? https://jsfiddle.net/j7vjeqrp/1/
[16:18:57] <SmashingX> hey so I don't know why my collapse button is not working :( https://jsfiddle.net/h6ctdrw0/1/
[16:19:21] <taplar_busy> SpecialTechnique: what do you mean?
[16:19:31] <SmashingX> onclick="$(this).closest('h4').click();"
[16:19:52] <taplar_busy> SpecialTechnique: your doing .appendTo('.promo');  which is appending without context
[16:21:51] <taplar_busy> SmashingX: you should really bind in your js, rather than in your markup
[16:23:06] <SmashingX> taplar_busy: well yes, let me figure out what's wrong and then I will do that
[16:31:27] <SpecialTechnique> taplar_busy: https://jsfiddle.net/j7vjeqrp/4/ hmmm... I still can't seem to grab the child still. It's appending all of them rather than the each child element :\
[16:37:44] <decx> does appendTo even have the context argument?
[16:38:06] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/j7vjeqrp/7/
[16:38:38] <decx> it doesnt
[16:38:39] <decx> surprise
[16:41:20] <SpecialTechnique> I see the difference, but why was my way wrong?
[16:41:46] <taplar_busy> what decx said
[16:41:50] <SpecialTechnique> decx: I was just following the jquery API and it doesn't really mention much about appendTo context
[16:42:22] <decx> the $ jquery selector allows a context argument $('.blah','.that') to select blah in that, appendTo doesnt have that. so your .view', this does nothing
[16:44:39] <SpecialTechnique> that taplar fiddle is so simple to read ;l
[16:44:59] <taplar_busy> you want easy to read
[16:45:14] <SpecialTechnique> And I'm like struggling to figure out why it wasn't working :\ Thanks though
[16:45:42] <decx> i explained it
[16:48:14] <SpecialTechnique> decx: yea i know, I understood after you explained, which made reading that taplar bit easier.
[17:44:29] * robertmaxrees yawns
[17:44:53] <taplar_busy> show off
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> ALWAYS
[17:45:15] <robertmaxrees> u jelly\
[17:45:26] <taplar_busy> heh
[17:45:53] <robertmaxrees> i want to be home playing guitar.
[17:46:22] <shoky> i'm home playing guitar for you
[17:46:27] <robertmaxrees> jerk!
[17:46:29] <shoky> ;D
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm borrowing my drummer's amp right now - i've been running it in tandem with mine and i'm all about it.
[17:47:58] <taplar_busy> i have an acoustic some where at my parents house
[17:48:14] <robertmaxrees> very nice.  what kind?
[17:48:27] <taplar_busy> cheap walmart one i was trying to learn on
[17:48:31] <robertmaxrees> hah, nice.
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> i need to get something to replace my taylor.
[17:50:14] <shoky> sweet. i'm just noodling on my cheap classical. need to replace my huge amp with a small one so i don't get too lazy to use it
[17:50:21] <shoky> er oh my, i'm quite lagged
[17:50:26] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:50:53] <robertmaxrees> i've been looking for something in the 40 watt range to replace my twin.
[17:53:16] <z1haze> if I log an element to the console and it shows [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: undefined] does this mean its undefined?
[17:53:31] <robertmaxrees> just means context is undefined.
[17:53:49] <z1haze> so it doesnt meant it cant find the element? ok good
[17:53:49] <shoky> i need me something smaller than that
[17:53:57] <robertmaxrees> z1haze try .length
[17:54:02] <robertmaxrees> $().length will tell you.
[17:54:03] <shoky> and not as loud
[17:54:12] <shoky> gr, this lag
[17:54:12] <robertmaxrees> shoky yeah my twin is WAY too loud for stage use.
[17:55:17] <z1haze> so 0 is bad in this case right? if i need it to exist
[17:55:44] <taplar_busy> would be a not found
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> z1haze 0 means there are no elements there
[17:56:23] <z1haze> hmm
[17:56:52] <z1haze> well when i submit this form with this markup. http://dpaste.com/3RR1R40 my el is saying its not there.. how would that be
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> what's your js?
[17:57:05] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:57:08] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) in this case?
[17:57:13] <z1haze> the form
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:57:25] <z1haze> $(this) is the form
[17:57:36] <robertmaxrees> share more of your js.
[17:57:43] <z1haze> ok
[17:58:28] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/38DD45T excuse the mess im still grasping it
[17:58:48] <taplar_busy> hah
[17:58:52] <taplar_busy> so this is not the form
[17:59:04] <taplar_busy> you need to use the variable you stored the this in outside the handler
[17:59:32] <taplar_busy> 'this' in that context is the success function
[17:59:33] <z1haze> so this becomes not the form inside the callback?
[17:59:41] <z1haze> ah i see
[17:59:50] <z1haze> sorry
[17:59:52] <shoky> this always changes between function calls
[18:00:11] <taplar_busy> nah, hey, you already had the variable so you seemed to know you'd need it later.  just need to use it now, :)
[18:00:38] <linux_daemon> can anyone help me with d3pie.js or point me to a channel where i can get some help?
[18:00:39] <z1haze> ok lol, i just checked. all god now. thanks
[18:00:42] <taplar_busy> and you don't have to do $(form)
[18:00:48] <taplar_busy> it's already a jQuery object
[18:01:50] * taplar_busy is going to run one more test and then he's going to go get a cheese burger and a fricken oreo shake
[18:02:13] <shoky> daring plan
[18:02:23] <taplar_busy> it's a winner
[18:02:39] <shoky> i do envy
[18:02:41] <taplar_busy> skipped lunch so i'm all fantasizing
[18:03:27] <taplar_busy> sweet, i'm outie5000.  later
[18:03:40] <shoky> byby
[18:05:03] <linux_daemon> can anyone help me with d3pie.js or point me to a channel where i can get some help?
[18:05:22] <decx> mmmmh... pie
[18:05:42] <linux_daemon> yep :)
[18:05:54] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon you can try posting your question here.
[18:06:02] <decx> dont know about that, but i do love pie in d3
[18:06:11] <decx> that d3pie.js*
[18:07:53] <linux_daemon> ok, i was working with c3js, on pie chart, there is a method load, that loads data, without redrawing the chart. but, on d3pie.js, using updateProp , it reloads the data, but redraws the chart. does anyone know a way to update the d3pie data without redrawing?
[18:12:45] <decx> pass a reference to your data array and apply your changes to that directly
[18:13:02] <linux_daemon> it redraws the chart
[18:13:02] <decx> then it'll just do its thing when you specifically redraw
[18:13:15] <robertmaxrees> why is redrawing the chart a problem?
[18:14:24] <linux_daemon> cause the redrawind causes a post call to db. in the begining, i have a set od data, that need to be shown. but the redraw causes a post
[18:15:10] <robertmaxrees> okay, so your real problem is you'd like to rerender the chart without that post?
[18:15:48] <decx> i cant tell with that plugins
[18:15:54] <linux_daemon> yes
[18:16:00] <decx> but pie charts are pretty straight forward in d3
[18:16:04] <z1haze> if I am logging a jquery object to the console, how do I go about just getting the html element filtered through all of this other mess that is shows
[18:16:19] <decx> mmmh... pie https://jsfiddle.net/127vskqo/
[18:17:10] <linux_daemon> the post gets 10 sets of data. i cicle through them using setInterval, but every freaking time it does another redraw and a post. and btw, i was referring to d3pie, not d3
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze .html()
[18:17:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze normally though you can hightlight the element on the page.
[18:17:31] <z1haze> seems logical :\
[18:17:39] <z1haze> with the console?
[18:17:53] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[18:17:57] <z1haze> chrome
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> mouseover the node.
[18:18:29] <robertmaxrees> in the dev tools
[18:18:51] <robertmaxrees> oh weird ff makes this a lot easier.
[18:19:12] <z1haze> well im using the snippet you helped me with yesterday
[18:19:25] <z1haze> to filter a link by the name of the link
[18:19:35] <z1haze> doesnt seem to be working
[18:19:44] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're talking about.
[18:20:02] <z1haze> heh, http://dpaste.com/3SP4TH9
[18:20:14] <z1haze> the var link part you added to me yesterday
[18:20:34] <z1haze> the element isnt getting removed so im guessing its not finding it
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> and el is what you think it is?
[18:20:54] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[18:21:02] <robertmaxrees> like, without seeing an example it's hard for me to know what the issue is.
[18:21:18] <z1haze> well everything else so far is working
[18:21:21] <robertmaxrees> it could be that you're caching el wrong so it's never getting the new elements, or something else.
[18:21:27] <z1haze> its adding the links on adding a like, changing the icons, changing the count, etc
[18:21:38] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:21:43] <z1haze> its counting down when i unlike, its just not removing the anchor from the dom
[18:21:49] <robertmaxrees> so what does that have to do with any of this?
[18:21:54] <robertmaxrees> like, without seeing your code, it's hard to help.
[18:22:25] <z1haze> ok well in that case: console.log($(link).html()); should give me the element in html?
[18:22:38] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:22:45] <z1haze> logs undefined
[18:22:46] <robertmaxrees> but that part will fail if doesn't work.
[18:22:59] <decx> gotta add more console.logs
[18:23:03] <decx> when in doubt log
[18:23:04] <robertmaxrees> *if return $(this).text() === data.username; doesn't work.
[18:23:07] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i know what the issue is.
[18:23:24] <z1haze> same issue with this?
[18:23:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:23:35] <robertmaxrees> you're appending to a child of el.
[18:23:45] <robertmaxrees> el.filter(function() { isn't looking at children.
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to do el.find('.post-likes like').filter()
[18:24:14] <arc_> kal el?
[18:24:17] <robertmaxrees> you were filtering the wrong elements.
[18:24:33] <decx> i had a weird request today, a list of categories was sorted by name but instead they wanted it to be sorted by string length so that the category list would create "a stair effect" i shit you not
[18:24:38] <z1haze> ah so el.find
[18:24:39] <z1haze> err
[18:24:48] <robertmaxrees> decx that's fucking magical.
[18:24:53] <z1haze> el.find('post-likes').filter( function() { ...
[18:24:57] <arc_> hahah
[18:25:06] <robertmaxrees> z1haze .post-likes .like
[18:25:09] <robertmaxrees> you need the links.
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> not the parent eement of the links.
[18:25:21] <z1haze> ah
[18:25:22] <z1haze> gotcha
[18:25:29] <robertmaxrees> why else would i give you the example i gave you?
[18:25:50] <z1haze> haha i was wondering that too xD i didnt see where you pulled the .like from but now i see i have it on the anchor
[18:26:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:26:19] <z1haze> anyhow thanks
[18:26:22] <z1haze> it makes sense
[18:27:05] <z1haze> freaking a
[18:27:12] <z1haze> still undefined
[18:27:51] <decx> console log your arguments
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> okay - verify the filter.
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> like... can't really do much at this point mang.
[18:28:12] <linux_daemon> so, noone?
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon probably not here, no.
[18:28:28] <z1haze> yay fixed it
[18:28:35] <z1haze> forgot the . in front the class for like
[18:28:55] <decx> mfw id="#id"
[18:28:59] <linux_daemon> cwap
[18:52:30] <uskerine> hi, I have a form with several submit buttons, each one should submit form to a different URL, is that possible with just html? do I need jQuery?
[18:53:31] <robertmaxrees> unless you have multiple forms, you'll need javascript.
[18:54:37] <uskerine> I have a form which displays some buttons or others depending on form status (I asked here yesterday about this, and btw finally implemented it in backend-server)
[18:54:50] <uskerine> now I have to make the buttons do actions
[18:55:07] <robertmaxrees> is each submit button apart of the same form?
[18:55:21] <robertmaxrees> or do you render one form with multiple buttons to the browser?
[18:55:28] <uskerine> they are all contained in the same form
[18:55:39] <robertmaxrees> okay, then you'll need javascript to help with that.
[18:55:50] <uskerine> so <form><button ...><button ...> ... </form>
[18:56:02] <robertmaxrees> right.  you'll need to use javascript.
[18:56:12] <uskerine> when  you say javascript you mean jQuery?
[18:56:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean javascript.
[18:56:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript, so you could use it if you'd like.
[18:56:33] <uskerine> so you won't use jQuery for that?
[18:56:43] <robertmaxrees> you could use jquery to do it, but it's not a requirement.
[18:56:53] <uskerine> I alwasys found jQuery easier
[18:56:59] <robertmaxrees> it's still javascript :)
[18:57:08] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that you don't *have* to use it.
[18:57:10] <uskerine> well we could also say it is assembler too
[18:57:12] <uskerine> but we wont' :)
[18:57:24] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people think that jquery is its own language.
[18:57:33] <robertmaxrees> making sure the distinction is clear.
[18:57:33] <uskerine> I know it is a big library
[18:57:37] <robertmaxrees> it's not really.
[18:58:36] <uskerine> so how would you implement that, just the guidance I will do my homework
[19:00:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd do three bindings.
[19:01:40] <robertmaxrees> one to the form's submit event to prevent default, then a handler on each button for click to do whatever you need it to do.
[19:02:04] <uskerine> and the buttons should be of type="buttons" to avoid default form submission, right?
[19:02:13] <robertmaxrees> just use button elements.
[19:02:35] <uskerine> I will do that
[19:02:44] <uskerine> thanks robertmaxrees
[19:02:46] <robertmaxrees> also: reread what i said :)
[19:03:03] <uskerine> I don't understand why do I have to prevent default?
[19:03:13] <robertmaxrees> are you submitting via ajax?
[19:03:18] <uskerine> I could do it
[19:03:28] <uskerine> I guess I would like to validate the form too in the near future
[19:03:35] <robertmaxrees> build that in now.
[19:03:52] <robertmaxrees> and if you use ajax, that's what the preventDefault() is there for.
[19:03:56] <robertmaxrees> to prevent form submission.
[19:04:16] <uskerine> but if there is no submit button , why should I worry about that?
[19:05:03] <robertmaxrees> buttons will submit forms.
[19:05:15] <uskerine> not if they are of type="button" right?
[19:05:47] <robertmaxrees> prevent potential headaches and exlicitly stop the event.
[19:06:33] <uskerine> so it is  just preventing future mistakes?
[19:06:59] <robertmaxrees> it is making it crystal clear what you intend to do :)
[19:08:08] <uskerine> uhm duly noted
[19:08:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know if I've ever heard anybody complain that code was too clear.
[19:08:20] <robertmaxrees> i often hear the exac opposite though.
[19:08:33] <uskerine> code is being generated out of a framework though, it should be structured and clear enough though
[19:08:37] * taplar hears from time to time that it's too dumbed down
[19:09:10] <robertmaxrees> uskerine that doesn't make any sense.
[19:09:18] <robertmaxrees> and is entirely irrelevant to the quality of your code ;)
[19:09:45] <uskerine> what does not make sense?
[19:10:17] <robertmaxrees> your statement - code from a framework has nothing to do with your own code quality :)_
[19:10:36] <uskerine> well, I write both the framework and the code the framework writes
[19:10:39] <uskerine> so they are related
[19:10:41] <uskerine> :-o
[19:11:14] <robertmaxrees> "the code the framework writes" is a little alarming.
[19:11:16] <uskerine> but I got the point of the third binding preventing form from being submitted
[19:11:36] <uskerine> it should write the associated jQuery handlers too
[19:11:46] <robertmaxrees> never.
[19:11:49] <uskerine> so it generates the buttons
[19:11:54] <robertmaxrees> that's actually bad practice.
[19:11:55] <uskerine> and the associated handler
[19:12:02] <uskerine> and how can you do it then?
[19:12:08] <robertmaxrees> generic js.
[19:12:12] <robertmaxrees> never generate javascript.
[19:12:23] <robertmaxrees> generating logic is sticky and difficult to handle.
[19:12:38] <robertmaxrees> you want to genericize everything and abstract it so your JS doesn't care about the data.
[19:12:55] <uskerine> uhm
[19:13:37] <uskerine> maybe I can use an attribute in the html button generated by the template and generic JS code to submit via ajax the form into that url
[19:13:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:13:47] <robertmaxrees> nooo.
[19:13:55] <robertmaxrees> generate markup, not js.
[19:14:05] <robertmaxrees> that's what html is there for- use data attributes.
[19:14:38] <uskerine> so you can use a data attribute in the html button
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> you can use data-attributes on anything.
[19:15:00] <robertmaxrees> and then read those using .data()
[19:15:06] <uskerine> and then  the JS code (not generated automatically) just reads that data-attribute and submits via AJAX the form to the right URL
[19:15:11] <uskerine> as the URL will change from screen to screen
[19:15:24] <taplar> or hidden fields and serialize the form
[19:15:46] <robertmaxrees> or hidden fields.
[19:15:51] <robertmaxrees> or all sorts of options.
[19:15:59] <robertmaxrees> anything to avoid code generation.
[19:16:02] <uskerine> I get the point
[19:16:07] <uskerine> I see
[19:16:11] <uskerine> well actually is much easier
[19:16:19] <uskerine> you just code a generic handler
[19:16:23] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[19:16:26] <uskerine> and get the specifics via data-attributes
[19:16:34] <robertmaxrees> keep data out of your logic and vice-versa.
[19:16:47] <uskerine> it is always a good idea to ask here
[19:18:00] <uskerine> thanks for all suggestions and help, tomorrow I will implement it
[21:24:35] <SpecialTechnique> Does clone remove any kind of functionality the element it's cloning had?
[21:27:09] <SpecialTechnique> why yes
[21:27:11] <SpecialTechnique> yes it does.
[21:33:16] <shoky> depends what you mean by functionality
[21:33:24] <shoky> and clone can take arguments too
[23:15:51] <phiz> p/w 49
