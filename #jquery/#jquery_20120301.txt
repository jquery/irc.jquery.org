[00:00:23] <Anorov> and i want to keep getting the next closest over and over, including if elements get removed
[00:03:05] <Cork> Anorov: that would be $(this).closest('.x').nextAll('.x').eq(0).find('.x')
[00:03:34] <Cork> opps .find('.y')
[00:03:39] <Anorov> cork: i think i can always use .parent() because y is always going to be a child of x
[00:04:12] <Cork> Anorov: the only thing closest will cost you is a loop and an if statement
[00:04:34] <Cork> unless speed is extreamly important it doesn't matter
[00:04:43] <iLearn> am wondering how i can make the upload process one click. ie select and upload a picture concurrently to a temp folder. also any way i can pop up the file select dialog with javascript???
[00:04:47] <Anorov> cork: not extremely important, but .parent() in this case makes more syntactic sense i think
[00:04:57] <Anorov> cork: while .closest() can be many possible directions
[00:05:06] <iLearn> anybody? plsease??
[00:05:08] <Cork> Anorov: it can't
[00:05:22] <Cork> Anorov: closest == parent + parent parents
[00:05:33] <Anorov> cork: err
[00:05:39] <Cork> Anorov: it just loops over parent and slooks for the selector
[00:05:45] <Cork> *looks
[00:05:54] <Cork> ?.closest
[00:05:54] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:05:55] <PERECil_> iLearn: there is a drag & drop api that exists within html 5 that permits suchs things
[00:06:13] <StevenCodes22> Anorov:  Whats your problem ?
[00:06:35] <Anorov> cork: ah i see. ok, well that doesn't really matter in this case i guess. do i need the .eq(0) and all that though? i think the next element will always be in proximity
[00:07:14] <Cork> Anorov: next('.x') will return nothing unless x is the direct following element
[00:07:19] <Anorov> StevenCodes22: if i have something like <div class="x"><span class="y">1</span><img></div><div class="x"><span class="y"><img></span></div>, and i currently have the first span ".y" selected, what's the cleanest way to get to the next ".y"? $(this).parent().next().children(".y") seems a bit gross
[00:07:27] <Cork> Anorov: thats why its most of the time better to use nextAll
[00:07:31] <Anorov> cork: in that case why not use closest(".x") there?
[00:07:32] <iLearn> PERECil_: not sure you quite understood me. okay, how can i pop up the file select dialog with javascript
[00:07:46] <Cork> Anorov: and that return siblins following the element filtered by the selector
[00:08:02] <StevenCodes22> ^.^
[00:08:05] <Cork> Anorov: cause your looking for a sibling, not a parent
[00:08:17] <Anorov> anorov: ah ok
[00:08:25] <Cork> Anorov: as i said closest ONLY checks parent
[00:08:31] <Cork> nothing else
[00:08:35] <Anorov> yeah you're right, i misunderstood it
[00:09:45] <Anorov> so what does .nextAll return exactly? how is the list of siblings ordered?
[00:09:58] <Cork> it is
[00:10:12] <Cork> its siblings starting from your element and down
[00:10:18] <Cork> filtered by the selector
[00:10:27] <Anorov> down, as in it won't look "up" at all?
[00:10:29] <Anorov> up as in above
[00:10:42] <Cork> exactly
[00:10:49] <Cork> that would be prevAll
[00:10:59] <Cork> and it only checks siblings
[00:10:59] <Anorov> hmm, no way to combine the 2 i guess?
[00:11:08] <Cork> that would be siblings
[00:11:15] <Anorov> ahh
[00:11:16] <Cork> but not sure you want that
[00:11:30] <Anorov> yeah i think that selects every sibling
[00:11:38] <Cork> yup
[00:12:25] <Anorov> well this is more confusing than i thought...but basically i just want to select the next ".x" if it exists, otherwise select the previous ".x"
[00:12:49] <Cork> Anorov: and what should limit if it exist next?
[00:13:00] <Cork> if theres any other element inbetween?
[00:13:07] <Cork> if there is any x below at all?
[00:13:22] <Anorov> cork: in this case i don't think there'll be any elements between. each .x will be direct siblings with every other .x, all in one div
[00:14:35] <Cork> Anorov: but you might slightly modify the structure later, and if you assume that
[00:14:38] <Cork> the code will break
[00:17:05] <Anorov> cork: now that i think about it, i guess i'll go with something more complex. basically i have a bunch of input text fields, and i always want the focus to be on the next field. and as soon as "enter" is pressed on one, focus switches
[00:17:22] <Anorov> cork: i'd be better off always making the "current" focus the very first element. somehow.
[00:17:25] <Anorov> both visually and dom-wise
[00:18:16] <Anorov> cork: then again i guess it'd make more sense to just remove elements on the fly and always change focus to the top...hm. i'll mess with it.
[00:19:21] <Anorov> also is $(".element")[0] different/slower than $(".element").eq(0) ?
[00:21:49] <darrellf> well it is not the box... loaded it into a completely different div at the bottom of the page and still only the 2 fields
[00:22:42] <Cork> Anorov: no
[00:22:53] <Cork> eq does more work but... its not slower
[00:23:13] <Cork> the overhead of eq is that it wrapps the element in a jquery object
[00:23:26] <Cork> $()[] is just the raw object
[00:23:29] <Cork> *raw element
[00:23:33] <Anorov> right, i see
[00:23:47] <Anorov> so i guess there's raw html, then there's dom, then there's jquery dom?
[00:23:59] <Cork> no
[00:24:12] <Cork> its html > dom > dom wrapped in a jquery object
[00:24:21] <Anorov> yeah, that's what i meant kinda
[00:24:31] <Cork> its basicallt an array like object with function on it
[00:24:31] <Anorov> this is my first time making a real website
[00:24:53] <Cork> and the array is a list of dom element
[00:25:14] <Xotix> hi can somepne help me getting this working on ie9? http://test.pmueller.dev.xiag.ch/ i don't know what's wrong with it
[00:27:17] <Cork> Xotix: you have an unclosed div there
[00:29:17] <Cork> Xotix: and ie doesn't support access-control-allow-orign on xmlhttprequest
[00:29:31] <Cork> you need to use XDomainRecuest for taht
[00:29:53] <Cork> *Request
[00:30:26] <Xotix> Cork, Ie9 doesn't? Really? Why does IE always need to do his own thing, But thanks. IE also could throw an error if i violate the one origin policy...
[00:31:10] <Cork> Xotix: cause they first implemented it as XDomainRequest without restriction
[00:31:28] <Cork> that later in ie9 added the csp control
[00:31:40] <Cork> but they never added it to xhr
[00:32:06] <Xotix> … ok thanks for the info
[00:32:09] <Cork> (btw XDomainRequest can only send text)
[00:32:23] <Cork> it forces text/html
[00:32:31] <Cork> so you can't send urlencoded form data
[00:32:57] <Cork> so ex. $_POST won't work
[00:33:49] <Xotix> Great, thanks anyway. I'm probably going to use jquery.form.js  wich uses the iframe hack this should work in ie iirc.
[00:34:06] <Cork> this was enough for me to realice that ie doesn't support csp xhr at all
[00:36:16] <LukeNukem> Hello
[00:36:21] <LukeNukem> hwo can i get the width and height of an image using jquery
[00:36:45] <Cork> only if the image is loaded in an img tag
[00:36:50] <Cork> or image object
[00:36:58] <Cork> new Image()
[00:37:12] <Whirl3d> LukemNukem, did you even try to look that up yourself?
[00:38:03] <LukeNukem> yep
[00:38:09] <LukeNukem> i did
[00:38:16] <mindis|wurk> i don't habeeb it
[00:38:26] <LukeNukem> im trying to make a lightbox
[00:39:16] <darrellf> hmmm 2nd result in google - jquery - How to get image size (height & width) using javascript ...
[00:39:17] <Cork> LukeNukem: if you want to have the dimentions of the image before its loaded; the server has to tell the script before hand
[00:39:30] <chrismou> LukeNukem: If you google "how can i get the width and height of an image using jquery" it's in the top 3 results
[00:39:46] <LukeNukem> Cork, like in a data attribute?
[00:40:01] <Cork> or something ya
[00:40:02] <jrockjiggz> you can load the img into memory and get the dimensions for your script
[00:40:05] <darrellf> now if only my answer was that easy
[00:40:21] <Cork> LukeNukem:though img tags know fast what size the image is going to have
[00:40:37] <darrellf> I have been searching google for hours and hours and hours and ...............
[00:40:45] <Cork> LukeNukem: but you would have to wait until the first few bits comes
[00:40:46] <LukeNukem> well if i use img tags to do that, i will have to make a hidden div and then grab the height and width and then make a new div and style it according
[00:41:10] <jrockjiggz> LukeNukem: look how its done here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/318630/get-real-image-width-and-height-with-javascript-in-safari-chrome
[00:41:35] <Cork> LukeNukem: and the hard part would be to know when you can ask, cause theres no event for when the size is found
[00:42:28] <jrockjiggz> cork: a callback on load() ?
[00:42:41] <Cork> thats when the complete image is loaded
[00:42:50] <Cork> not when the browser knows it dimentions
[00:43:19] <Cork> the dimentions only need the first few bytes of the image (unless its vector graphic)
[00:43:36] <LukeNukem> meh..going with data attributes
[00:43:59] <jrockjiggz> .onload    http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?t=108392
[00:44:06] <Cork> LukeNukem: its prob the best option ya
[00:44:17] <narsilou> Hi, I think I found a bug with keydown(), it fires up only 0 keycodes for letters in chrome android, anyone else saw this behaviour ?
[00:44:20] <Cork> jrockjiggz: your missing the point; load is way late
[00:44:35] <jrockjiggz> yea..
[00:44:55] <LukeNukem> or would you guys know any lightbox plugin which has extra space where i can add my own stuff(leave a comment, like this photo yada yada)
[00:45:19] <Cork> i'm quite sure there is one
[00:45:23] <Cork> theres many out there
[00:45:41] <Cork> but haven't needed to use one for ages
[00:45:50] <LukeNukem> well im creating a sn ;p
[00:48:24] <jrockjiggz> honestly, this jquery stuff is getting out of hand... http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/#/home
[00:49:41] <jrockjiggz> that.. and this sick scrolling effect http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/parallax/
[00:49:48] <darrellf> muh ha ha ha
[00:50:00] <darrellf> Cork, I found it
[00:50:04] <jrockjiggz> another sick scrolling effect http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/
[00:50:24] <darrellf> IE didn't like the html it was getting back
[00:50:42] <Cork> darrellf: yup that was kinda obvius :)
[00:50:51] <Cork> what did it choke on?
[00:51:08] <Cork> it was something around lastname right?
[00:51:12] <Anorov> that scrolling is cool
[00:51:19] <darrellf> seem I had some end div in the code coming back because the start div was already in the page
[00:51:40] <darrellf> once I put the start div in the code coming back it rendered it all
[00:51:48] <Cork> darrellf: you mean end divs without a start tag?
[00:52:30] <darrellf> the <div> was already in the page... the </div> was coming back in the code....
[00:54:16] <darrellf> well 1am got to be up for work in 4 hours... thanks for trying to help me solve that Cork I need some Zzzzzzz
[00:57:17] <narsilou> Hi, I think I found a bug with keydown(), it fires up only 0 keycodes for letters in chrome  android, anyone else saw this behaviour ?
[00:57:37] <Pupeno_W> Does anybody have any photo gallery to recommend? I search a little bit and I found a lot of flashy beautiful things, but they seem to be created to showcase how cool HTML5 is instead to be used in production, where not everything has a correct canvas implementation; they don't look that they'll degrade correctly.
[00:57:40] <nights``> hi
[00:57:50] <nights``> i want to submit a form with some values "stored" in a div
[00:57:57] <nights``> how can i submit them?
[00:58:06] <nights``> with a traditional submit
[00:58:13] <Cork> narsilou: have you checked so its not caused by the browser?
[00:58:23] <Cork> narsilou: that is tested with native events
[00:58:33] <narsilou> How can I check that ?
[00:58:42] <Cork> +listeners
[00:58:42] <mindis|wurk> nights`` i suppose you could add hidden inputs that take those values
[00:58:55] <Cork> narsilou: use addEventListener instead of jquery
[00:59:14] <Cork> ?mdc addEventListener
[00:59:15] <nights``> mindis|wurk: oh, good idea.
[00:59:16] <bot-t> Cork, element.addEventListener - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - addEventListener registers a single event listener on a single target. The event target may be a single node in a document, the document itself, a window , or an XMLHttpRequest . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[00:59:17] <nights``> let me do that
[00:59:33] <narsilou> Cork: Thanks
[01:00:07] <narsilou> Cork: The name of the event is still keydown ?
[01:00:15] <Cork> yes
[01:00:47] <Cork> narsilou: make sure you do it on a dom element and not a jquery object though
[01:05:22] <narsilou> Cork: I tried it here and keycode are also 0, does that mean it's the browser ?
[01:05:32] <narsilou> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/d4FVA/
[01:05:33] <Cork> yes
[01:05:39] <Xotix> iOn IE9: f you double click on the little image on the right (yellow, blue) and choose an image, you get js error access denied. Why?  http://tinyw.in/i3RW
[01:05:51] <narsilou> Cork: Thanks
[01:08:04] <Cork> Xotix: you do?
[01:08:12] <Cork> i get "success" here
[01:08:56] <Xotix> Cork, does the image change?
[01:09:37] <Cork> it gets removed and a dropp area shows
[01:10:00] <Xotix> Cork, you got default security settings?
[01:10:44] <Cork> Xotix: almost
[01:10:50] <Cork> its a w2k8r2 server
[01:10:59] <Cork> and the script restriction is lifted
[01:11:03] <Cork> other then that, yes
[01:11:22] <Cork> it should behave like a normal desktop ie9
[01:11:57] <Xotix> hmm
[01:13:55] <redheadphones> what am i doing wrong here to have offNodes never get updated? http://jsfiddle.net/z5eYm/
[01:15:24] <Cork> redheadphones: whats in graphCheck ?
[01:16:33] <redheadphones> Cork, sorry, this should be all of it: http://jsfiddle.net/z5eYm/1/
[01:18:11] <Cork> redheadphones: have you tried logging what that function does?
[01:18:24] <Cork> might be it doesn't return what you think it does
[01:18:33] <guy> http://www.fernando.com.ar/jquery-puzzle/index.php anyone know a similar plugin to this one? Puzzle.
[01:18:58] <Xotix> cork, script restriction. where can i find these options?
[01:19:25] <redheadphones> Cork, stepping through the while loop and graphCheck, it looks like the offNodes assignment isn't executed after the first time
[01:19:34] <iLearn> can i use jquery to popup a file open dialog?
[01:20:18] <redheadphones> i wonder if it's something with updating offNodes in the loop with the condition being offNodes.length. would that be stale?
[01:23:17] <StevenCodes22> redheadphones:  http://jsfiddle.net/d4FVA/ This is an example of grabbing keycodes using js right ?
[01:24:56] <redheadphones> StevenCodes22, looks that way
[01:25:01] <kmurph79> is there a difference between $('#blah li')  and $('#blah').find(li) ?
[01:26:35] <theBrettman> do you think I'd get smacked if I asked a girl if I could fork her on GitHub?
[01:26:59] <Cork> kmurph79: if you mean find('li') then only that the second one is run as sizzel selectiors
[01:27:07] <sdx> ...
[01:27:07] <Cork> *as two
[01:27:32] <Cork> kmurph79: but they should result in the same selection, and no speed difference
[01:27:40] <sx2020> does anyone know how to detect a location href change?
[01:27:49] <sx2020> i know there are methods to detect hashchange, but I want to detect actual href changes..
[01:27:57] <kmurph79> Cork: thanks
[01:28:02] <theBrettman> sx2020, you mean to stop it?
[01:28:04] <Zogot> so window changes sx2020?
[01:28:09] <Cork> sx2020: onunload?
[01:28:32] <sx2020> Well, I use pushState to update the URL.  but in case the user presses the browser back fwd button, the url changes and I need to detect this.
[01:28:49] <sx2020> so I can update the content via ajax.
[01:28:52] <Cork> that would be the popState evnet
[01:28:58] <Cork> *event
[01:29:59] <sx2020> hmm I thought popState was deprecated?
[01:30:27] <Xotix> Cork: On default, i can make a cross domain non ajax post call (simple form submit) with ie9 right? So if ie9 doesn't know the cors header, why doesn't it just make a simple post call out of it?
[01:31:00] <Cork> Xotix: it knows the cors headers
[01:31:23] <Cork> it just doesn't support doing cross domain xmlhttprequest
[01:31:58] <Cork> Xotix: theres a lot of things to take into account when handling xss
[01:33:17] <sx2020> @Cork: onpopstate does not trigger on browser back/fwd in chrome
[01:33:24] <Xotix> Cork, how do you get to xss know? So with the cors header, i could e.g. outsource my resources(img) without problems but not do any xhr stuff?

[01:48:29] <sx2020> @Cork: thanks. My problem was structuring the function call incorrectly. I was doing this: "function pop(){ console.log('pop!'); }"  "window.onpopstate = pop()"
[01:49:19] <geoffw8_> morning all
[01:49:25] <Cork> sx2020: heh so you bound null as a listner :)
[01:49:26] <sx2020> @Cork: I guess that is fundamentally flawed?
[01:49:30] <geoffw8_> peol: great article :)
[01:49:51] <geoffw8_> peol: about perfect for my level, can write ruby/rails, never really had javascript/jquery *click*
[01:50:05] <Cork> sx2020: = pop() is the return value from pop,  = pop is the reference to the function
[01:50:42] <sx2020> oh, I see. so remove the parentheses and it should work?
[01:50:46] <Cork> sx2020: so when you bind event listners you should always give it the function name without paranteces
[01:50:52] <sx2020> that makes sense
[01:50:53] <Cork> sx2020: yes
[01:51:13] <Cork> sx2020: and you should preferably use addEventListener instead on on*
[01:51:21] <Cork> sx2020: that way you don't overwrite old listners

[01:59:50] <pradev> I am using the jquery jFeed plugin to get feeds of a website.
[01:59:54] <solidus-river> i'm having trouble doing a join
[02:00:07] <Xotix> How can i get the value of an file input in ie9? if i do $().val() i get e.g. C://fakepath/foo.jpg
[02:00:09] <solidus-river> i have a Post object and a PostsTags table that has an id, a post_id and a tag_id
[02:00:22] <solidus-river> but Post.joins(:posts_tags) does not seem to be valid
[02:00:57] <pradev> I want to search if there is a keyword in the feed title.
[02:01:03] <pradev> How can I do that?
[02:03:44] <solidus-river> ok, given that tags is a list of id's
[02:03:50] <solidus-river> how do i change this from an inclusive to exclusive
[02:04:08] <solidus-river> scope :filter_by_tags, lambda { |tags| joins(:tags).where(:posts_tags => {:tag_id => tags }).group(:id) }
[02:04:31] <aaronmcadam> is that ruby?
[02:04:49] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: is that pointed to me?
[02:04:52] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:05:01] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: yeah its a ruby scope using active record
[02:05:01] <aaronmcadam> is that python or ruby
[02:05:17] <aaronmcadam> ok, so ur askin ruby questions in #jquery, ok :)
[02:05:24] <solidus-river> LOL
[02:05:26] <solidus-river> its late
[02:05:29] <solidus-river> :X
[02:05:43] <aaronmcadam> I use django so I dunno
[02:05:49] <solidus-river> yeah i got the wrong channel
[02:05:56] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[02:06:07] <solidus-river> haha, thanks for looking at it though
[02:06:12] <aaronmcadam> ahha no worries
[02:06:16] <aaronmcadam> ruby is nice
[02:06:19] <solidus-river> is django that far off from rails, they seem pretty similar to me in a lot of ways
[02:06:28] <aaronmcadam> they are yes
[02:07:01] <aaronmcadam> from what I've seen there's not a huge amount of difference
[02:07:22] <aaronmcadam> although, the conventions in rails are a lot more strict it seems
[02:07:41] <aaronmcadam> tho, django has its own conventions it likes you to follow, mainly in its ORM
[02:08:12] <solidus-river> yeah it would be fun to do some python stuff, i dont get what all the fighting is about between them, i'm going to take this to the right channel though :P
[02:08:58] <theBrettman> how can I get the application button? I tried event.which and everything else I can think of but that doesn't work on the ctrl or application/menu buttons
[02:09:02] <theBrettman> *keys
[02:09:22] <theBrettman> and it's impossible to find that in a search on google
[02:09:34] <aaronmcadam> hah yeah solidus-river, they're both very good, elegant in their own ways. the in-fighting is *really* stupid
[02:09:46] <theBrettman> anyone know a reference that might have all the key events?
[02:09:59] <aaronmcadam> theBrettman: do u mean event.target?
[02:10:22] <aaronmcadam> application button? u want the actual key codes?
[02:10:33] <aaronmcadam> ?keyup @ theBrettman
[02:10:34] <bot-t> theBrettman, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[02:10:44] <aaronmcadam> that'll tell u how to get the key codes theBrettman
[02:11:06] <theBrettman> I tried the one for keydown
[02:12:34] <theBrettman> yeah, it didn't work
[02:12:52] <theBrettman> maybe it's called the select key?
[02:13:05] <aaronmcadam> what are u trying to do??
[02:13:12] <theBrettman> contextmenu
[02:13:18] <aaronmcadam> u mean right click?
[02:13:24] <theBrettman> yes but for keyboard
[02:13:26] <iLearn> can i use jquery to popup a file open dialog?
[02:13:29] <aaronmcadam> oh god right
[02:13:38] <iLearn> also can i set filename from js?
[02:13:42] <aaronmcadam> theBrettman: u can use console.log
[02:13:42] <theBrettman> and it's not included in the contextmenu event
[02:13:47] <theBrettman> I tried
[02:13:48] <aaronmcadam> but how will mac handle that
[02:13:49] <theBrettman> it didn't show
[02:13:56] <theBrettman> that and ctrl don't
[02:14:03] <theBrettman> and the windows buttons
[02:14:33] <theBrettman> I guess it's the same as alt+ctrl
[02:15:01] <aaronmcadam> u can't depend on that key
[02:15:43] <Kapil> 	Jquery .val() not working in IE8, working fine in firefox. is it expected behavior of JQuery?
[02:15:44] <theBrettman> idk, what does mac use for that?
[02:15:47] <iLearn> hello!
[02:16:05] <theBrettman> maybe that's y contextmenu event doesn't include it
[02:16:08] <aaronmcadam> theBrettman: use a lib like this: http://robertwhurst.github.com/KeyboardJS/
[02:16:15] <aaronmcadam> theBrettman: just ctrl+click
[02:17:07] <theBrettman> I think I'll just let this one go
[02:17:13] <raj> I have a json object, I'd like to display as a collapsible tree
[02:17:17] <aaronmcadam> Kapil: very unlikely, something else must be wrong in ie8, have u got rogue console statements
[02:17:20] <theBrettman> it's not for me anyway
[02:18:02] <theBrettman> is contextmenu event javascript or jquery?
[02:18:13] <gasull> Why does jQuery UI create a <div id="ui-datepicker-div" class="ui-datepicker ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix ui-corner-all"></div> tag at the bottom of my page?
[02:18:21] <Cork> theBrettman: its native dom if thats what you mean
[02:18:37] <theBrettman> ah
[02:18:52] <theBrettman> well if they didn't include that button in it, then I won't worry about it
[02:19:16] <theBrettman> it's probably up to the browsers anyway
[02:19:29] <aaronmcadam> gasull: where do u think the div comes from when u click on the date input
[02:19:55] <aaronmcadam> *nobody* uses that key anyway
[02:20:09] <aaronmcadam> my workmate just turned round and said he never even knew it existed
[02:20:25] <Kapil> aaronmcadam: Thanks for reply. http://pastebin.com/ta58K2rg chk line 9, 10, 92. This is fine in FF but not in IE8
[02:20:32] <theBrettman> how's it look? I forked the demo for ui-menu contextmenu: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/PawEs/
[02:20:37] <aaronmcadam> lint ur code first of all
[02:20:48] <ves> i find a bug?: checkbox doen't work if his fathers have got .click() with a 'return false;' to stop at deeper father.  http://jsfiddle.net/ccAwB/1/
[02:20:53] <Xotix> How can i set the input value fora file inut on ie with jquery?
[02:20:53] <Kapil> http://pastebin.com/ta58K2rg
[02:21:16] <aaronmcadam> that's some sentence
[02:21:35] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: I don't think that's possible
[02:21:54] <theBrettman> the bug is your code, ves. it's preventing default on the click, you'll have to code it another way
[02:21:58] <aaronmcadam> a file input is browser sandboxed
[02:22:06] <Xotix> aaronmcadam, must be somehow.
[02:22:23] <Xotix> can i make type="text, set the value and the nchange it's type….?
[02:22:23] <aaronmcadam> and *don't* use `return false` to suppress events
[02:22:27] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: no
[02:22:29] <aaronmcadam> it's not
[02:22:38] <aaronmcadam> I've talked about this before with smart peoples
[02:22:56] <aaronmcadam> Xotix... uh.. u could *try*
[02:23:00] <aaronmcadam> ?tias
[02:23:01] <bot-t> Try It And See
[02:23:20] <Xotix> So how the heck should i be able to create an ajax fiel upload which got triggered by js? IE got too much security restirctions...
[02:23:36] <aaronmcadam> they're there for a reason
[02:23:46] <aaronmcadam> Zurb's upload was good, but doesn't work in Chrome
[02:23:51] <aaronmcadam> but ye could look at that
[02:24:17] <aaronmcadam> all those file uploads use flash cuz of the security issue
[02:24:54] <Xotix> what security issue? The valdiating is done on server side anyway.
[02:25:26] <aaronmcadam> you can't access the file system
[02:25:27] <GuruRAM> but you can't access file system via js
[02:25:28] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[02:25:30] <aaronmcadam> think about it
[02:25:43] <aaronmcadam> not without the File API
[02:25:54] <aaronmcadam> there's probably a good shim for it somewhere
[02:26:44] <aaronmcadam> "html5 please" or something, Paul Irish's new site on the shiz
[02:28:16] <Cork> aaronmcadam: you can't really access the file system through file api either
[02:28:23] <shwaiil> Q: If I have a structure like <PARENT> <CHILD><THIS  HEADER /><CONTENT /></CHILD><CHILD><THIS HEADER/><CONTENT /></CHILD>, how could I, scroll smooth from one "This header" element to other ? Thanks for looking!
[02:28:28] <Cork> aaronmcadam: all you can do is access the content of input type file
[02:28:34] <aaronmcadam> ooh nice
[02:28:37] <aaronmcadam> makes sense
[02:28:46] <aaronmcadam> drag n drop
[02:28:53] <aaronmcadam> like mothereffinganimatedgif
[02:28:56] <aaronmcadam> have u seen that Cork
[02:29:04] <Cork> yes
[02:29:07] <Cork> used it too
[02:29:08] <aaronmcadam> sexual huh
[02:29:33] <Cork> but the point was you can't ever access the system, only what the browser gives you
[02:30:26] <antgel_> hi people, still new to jquery, using jquery UI for the first time today :) can someone shed some light on when and why the "widget" component is useful?
[02:30:41] <antgel_> is it to make widgets that don't exist in standard jquery ui?
[02:31:00] <Cork> antgel_: you mean the widgetfactory ?
[02:31:13] <antgel_> and if so, when does something become a "widget"?  when i have plans to reuse it?  when it should have rich functionality as opposed to just displaying content?
[02:31:15] <antgel_> Cork: yes
[02:31:34] <ves> theBrettman: checkbox results checked during event... how uncheck? http://jsfiddle.net/ccAwB/2/
[02:31:57] <antgel_> Cork: i'm reading http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget-factory but not finding it that newbie-friendly
[02:32:04] <Cork> antgel_: everything in jquery-ui is built with widget factory
[02:32:17] <Cork> antgel_: and yes if you want to build your own thats what you use
[02:33:42] <theBrettman> ves, do you see it outputs undefined - div clicked. when you click on the #father?
[02:33:46] <antgel_> Cork: right.  any comments on my "when does something become a "widget"" comment ^^?
[02:34:19] <antgel_> my requirement is for a "notification zone" - think of it like a to-do list with tasks, each task has a description and a button that does $something
[02:34:36] <antgel_> so i can build it in a div, with the tasks in a <ul>, blah blah
[02:34:48] <Cork> antgel_: you don't have to use widget if you don't want to
[02:34:57] <Cork> antgel_: its ment for reusable code
[02:35:08] <antgel_> when does it start to be beneficial to use the widget factory, over just coding something in html / css
[02:35:20] <Cork> but if what your creating can be thought of as a gui object, then its a widget
[02:35:20] <antgel_> Cork: right
[02:35:28] <Cork> like a grid, or a menu or...
[02:36:05] <antgel_> Cork: so if i wanted this notification zone to be like a "portlet" (plone term!), i would do well to implement as a widget rather than cut and paste ?  :D
[02:36:06] <Cork> antgel_: if you started today, i would say; don't use it
[02:36:10] <antgel_> hehe
[02:36:12] <antgel_> sure
[02:36:13] <Cork> antgel_: feel your way around it first
[02:36:21] <ves> theBrettman: of corse, but clicking on checkbox it's return is 'checked'
[02:36:26] <antgel_> just always have one eye down the road
[02:36:29] <Cork> when you see how things work, then its the time to dive into widget creating
[02:36:53] <theBrettman> well checked is an input thing. it's boolean
[02:36:59] <Cork> antgel_: i would say when you use a segment of code more then say two or three times
[02:37:00] <theBrettman> so you need to test if checked
[02:37:13] <Cork> antgel_: but it really depends on the complexity of the code
[02:37:33] <theBrettman> or in this case, set it to true or false
[02:38:37] <marekw2143> does $("SomeSelector).each() returns $("SomeSelector") ?
[02:39:26] <Cork> marekw2143: du menar efter each eller i?
[02:39:27] <theBrettman> marekw2143, yes, and an iteration of everything after
[02:39:32] <Cork> wops wrong language :)
[02:39:49] <Cork> marekw2143: you mean after each on inside it?
[02:40:03] <marekw2143> theBrettman: "an iteration of everything after"?
[02:40:33] <Cork> theBrettman: thats wrong
[02:40:38] <theBrettman> is the selector a collection? then it would iterate through each in the collection
[02:40:40] <beasty> mornings
[02:40:45] <beasty> -s
[02:40:50] <theBrettman> I was talking about chaining, Cork
[02:40:54] <Cork> the callback inside each only gives you the dom elements one at a time
[02:41:07] <Cork> each returns the same selector it gets though
[02:41:22] <marekw2143> theBrettman: yes, it's a collectoin, like ".SOmeClass"
[02:42:03] <theBrettman> the collection is an array and it iterates through it
[02:45:42] <theBrettman> take a look what I did with each for an example of what I meant by chaining: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/PawEs/
[02:46:08] <Xotix> On ie, if you have a form and js manipulates e.g. it's action, you can't submit() it anymore. Is there a workaorun?
[02:46:13] <Xotix> *workaround
[02:46:41] <theBrettman> what do you mean, Xotix?
[02:46:56] <theBrettman> why wouldn't you be able to submit?
[02:47:00] <shwaiil> Q: in a document I have various elements with the same class name. When clicking them, I want to check its index. I've tryed to $( body ).index( className ); but returns -1. I'm pretty sure this is the syntax but its not working. any tip ? tks
[02:47:45] <theBrettman> shwaiil, show an example
[02:47:51] <theBrettman> like in a fiddle
[02:48:22] <theBrettman> it may just be syntax
[02:48:24] <shwaiil> theBrettman: tks for looking , found the solution
[02:48:34] <theBrettman> k
[02:48:54] <gianiaz> hi, I have a question about frames, not jquery related, there's a way to call a function in the opener window from a script opened in a iframe?
[02:48:55] <shwaiil> I need to place in the first selector the set of elements like $( commonClassHere ).index( clickedElementWithinThatClass )
[02:49:53] <raj> anyone familiar with jstree?
[02:50:35] <theBrettman> Xotix, you could try to see if it works by triggering submit
[02:51:06] <antgel_> Cork: thanks
[02:52:01] <theBrettman> like $('#submit').click(function() { $('#myForm').trigger('submit')});
[02:53:19] <theBrettman> I don't know why I put trigger('submit') instead of submit(). ohwell
[02:53:52] <Xotix> theBrettman: thanks, i'll try it.
[02:55:46] <rworth> antgel_: another answer to your questions of when something becomes a widget - when it has state
[02:56:24] <theBrettman> and if that don't work, do a test to see if the submit event fires when you click submit by using $('#myForm').submit(function(){alert('submit event fired'); return false});
[02:56:27] <rworth> widgets help manage state from init to destroy by allowing you to get and set options (that sometimes have side effects) and call methods (some of which modify options) and handle events
[02:56:46] <antgel_> rworth: thanks!  very useful
[02:57:53] <rworth> you may also want to read http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/tips-for-developing-jquery-ui-widgets/ and http://bililite.nfshost.com/blog/understanding-jquery-ui-widgets-a-tutorial/ and http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[02:58:33] <theBrettman> ha, I read the 2nd one
[02:58:42] <theBrettman> not the first though
[02:59:05] <theBrettman> and I found another one useful: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/coding-your-first-jquery-ui-plugin/
[03:03:01] <rworth> add those to the top of http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[03:03:06] <rworth> s/add/added/
[03:04:30] <antgel_> i'm using jquery ui css class .ui-widget-content in some of my divs, as it makes them look nice and uniform.  but how can i override some of those attributes?  e.g. that class forces a white background which i don't always want
[03:04:44] <antgel_> in firebug, the id atttributes get overriden by the class :(
[03:05:36] <rworth> you need to choose selectors that are as specific or more specific in order to override
[03:05:47] <rworth> and also include them after the theme stylesheet
[03:13:34] <Xotix> theBrettman: if i have a form with a file input. Also i've a normal button. If i press the button, i change the forms action. onchange of the form i trigger submit(). This works, but the goal is, that the file input opens automatically and the action changes if you press on the button. But if you do input.click(); the submiting doesn't work anymore. Heres a demo:  open in ie http://tinyw.in/w7LA
[03:13:41] <Xotix> trigger
[03:15:10] <shwaiil> Q: How to get the offset or height size from top of document and a element ? For example, I would like to know where's <body><div id="myElement"></div></body>  positioned so I can smoothly scroll to it. Any tip ?tks
[03:17:07] <mindis|wurk> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[03:25:38] <ves> bug checkbox click: work-around founded: http://jsfiddle.net/ccAwB/3/
[03:26:21] <ves> where I can post this matter and solution ? I haven't any account on sdk sites
[03:31:24] <Xotix> does ie have something like console.log() for objects like chrome, ff?
[03:31:43] <SlinQ> no, but you can get Javascript programs to emulate it
[03:31:59] <SlinQ> http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/fauxconsole/
[03:34:27] <SlinQ> Xotix, http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/ is also good, if a little bloated
[03:34:40] <Xotix> SlinQ:  thanks
[03:40:11] <twoface> debugbar can also do it, although it is terribly heavy
[03:40:30] <twoface> they also released a tool for viewing a page in all IE versions in a single program
[03:40:32] <Xotix> I can't clone a file input without losing its val?
[03:40:52] <Xotix> twoface:  console.log(obj) doesn't work in ie dev toolbars.
[03:41:17] <twoface> Xotix, http://www.debugbar.com
[03:41:21] <Xotix> oh u wrote about the debuger.
[03:41:32] <Xotix> ie9 got somethign integrated, thought you meant that.
[03:41:35] <Xotix> thanks
[03:49:53] <cesaro> i have an id stored in a variable, and i'd like to select any an <a> with the same id.
[03:50:21] <cesaro> var myid = $(this).attr('id'); <---- an <a> with the id i just stored in there.
[03:50:25] <cesaro> not quite sure how to select it.
[03:50:41] <blackspotwiggins> cesaro, what's wrong with just using this?
[03:50:47] <fleur> just use a css selector
[03:51:19] <cesaro> well, i may have taken the wrong approach, but its a button thats triggering the js ere
[03:51:22] <cesaro> the <a> is hidden.
[03:51:29] <fleur> and bear in mind that xhtml ids cannot start with a number, if it is your case
[03:51:35] <quicksilver> cesaro: $('#'+myid);
[03:51:39] <blackspotwiggins> omfg
[03:51:45] <quicksilver> but you can't have two elements with the same id.
[03:51:55] <cesaro> hmm.
[03:52:01] <cesaro> i can kill two birds with one stone there
[03:52:01] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you should wrap it in another $()
[03:52:05] <blackspotwiggins> to be even more redundant
[03:52:13] <Xotix> How can i clone a file input into another form on ie?
[03:52:24] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, prolly you cant
[03:53:53] <Xotix> Can i catch the path to the file which was choosen somehow?
[03:54:13] <twoface> nope
[03:54:34] <_ramo> hi
[03:54:52] <_ramo> how can i replace one button with another after an successfull ajax request?
[03:54:53] <cesaro> it doesnt seem to match :i
[03:54:54] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, in some browsers maybe
[03:55:10] <cesaro> $('#'+myid)
[03:55:12] <blackspotwiggins> _ramo, $("#button").replaceWith("<button>")
[03:55:20] <blackspotwiggins> cesaro, are you that thick?
[03:55:28] <blackspotwiggins> this already references that element
[03:55:32] <_ramo> thanks blackspotwiggins
[03:55:36] <blackspotwiggins> you dont have to reselect
[03:55:37] <Guest25256> Imagine if I have a link in the format "1. ello world"
[03:55:44] <Guest25256> How can I replace the 1 with something else?
[03:56:03] <Guest25256> It's for when I finish sorting list items.. I want to replace it wit the he new index
[03:56:06] <cesaro> how does it already reference it.
[03:56:13] <blackspotwiggins> cesaro, this?!
[03:56:15] <blackspotwiggins> do you even read
[03:56:16] <cesaro> i have not selected the <a> i want at all
[03:56:25] <cesaro> this contains the button i clicked.
[03:56:30] <blackspotwiggins> so you have multiple elements with same id?
[03:56:38] <cesaro> i have altered that.
[03:56:54] <cesaro> so its something like <a id=notes_123> that i'd like to select
[03:57:03] <cesaro> and the 123 i can extract from the this, as they correlate
[03:57:33] <Xotix> blackspotwiggins: i have an ajax image upload which gets triggered automatically. everything works but ie doesn't allow to auto submit forms which have been modified with js. e.g. used .click() on an input. workaroudn would be, making a tempForm and clone the input into there, but this doesn't work either… Don't like this browser. -
[03:57:43] <eddyb_> any idea how I can get the text content of a contenteditable element?
[03:57:57] <eddyb_> like, have <br>s replaced with newlines
[03:58:30] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, you cant clone file inputs. that would be a security nightmare
[03:59:28] <_ramo> blackspotwiggins: is that possible with an id too? i mean: $("#button").replaceWith('#otherbutton') ? i have an test in that if a specific attributes exists, it show wheter the one or the other. but via ajax the buttons should be replaced
[03:59:47] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias @ _ramo
[03:59:52] <blackspotwiggins> aww no bot
[03:59:59] <sanjayb> Xotix: aa that seems a bit like hell ..
[04:00:01] <_ramo> :P
[04:00:01] <quicksilver> _ramo: replaceWith is for actually removing elements.
[04:00:06] <blackspotwiggins> _ramo, try it. read the docs for replaceWith
[04:00:12] <quicksilver> _ramo: are you sure you don't just want to hide one and show the other?
[04:00:31] <blackspotwiggins> quicksilver, he asked specifically to _replace_. hence i gave him the method to _replace_.
[04:00:37] <quicksilver> I know you did.
[04:00:43] <quicksilver> I'm not criticising your advice.
[04:00:56] <quicksilver> but he then said "if a specific attributes exists, it show wheter the one or the other"
[04:01:05] <quicksilver> so I wonder if his first question was worded in a confusing way
[04:01:08] <blackspotwiggins> learning to ask the correct questions is part of developing software
[04:01:10] <_ramo> i have two scenarious
[04:01:30] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: no shit :P
[04:01:31] <PrgmrBill> I would argue asking the right questions has many, many applications in life
[04:01:33] <PrgmrBill> and not just programming
[04:01:48] <GuruRAM> agreed
[04:02:17] <_ramo> the first is: on page load, an attribute is check: if it is not set button a is shown, if is set, button b is set. the second scenario is: button a is set -> the user clicks on this button, some actions are processed -> the attribute is set -> now without page refresh button a should be "replaced" with button b
[04:02:18] <eddyb_> so, no idea how I can get a text-equivalent of the contents of a <div> element?
[04:02:36] <blackspotwiggins> eddyb_, have you tried.. .text() ?
[04:02:45] <blackspotwiggins> but yeah, no idea.
[04:02:57] <eddyb_> it's the text elements, not the text-equivalent :(
[04:03:05] <eddyb_> like, <br>s are ignored and stuff
[04:04:07] <eddyb_> or, can I force the browser to insert text in a contenteditable element, instead of wrapping some of it in <div>s and using <br>s
[04:06:15] <Xotix> blackspotwiggins: I have a form. Imagen, theres a picture on the page, if you click on it, the forms action should change and also I do input.click(); so the input opens automatically. Then, at onChange of the input/form, i submit the form. My Problem is the input.click(); if you do tha automatically, IE blocks the submiting of this form. Any Idea how i can deal with that?
[04:06:51] <sanjayb> Xotix: its probably a security concern that you cannot get around
[04:07:11] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, you cant.
[04:07:26] <xec> eddyb_: get the .html() content instead?
[04:07:52] <sanjayb> Xotix: not sure if this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2389341/jquery-change-event-to-input-file-on-ie
[04:08:29] <eddyb_> xec: but that's not the text I want
[04:08:51] <eddyb_> chrome inserts <div>s all over my contenteditable
[04:09:29] <xec> eddyb_: that doesn't sound right. could you whip up a demo + explanation of what happens and what you need?
[04:09:37] <WhiteAngel> Hello, guys
[04:09:40] <Xotix> hmm, i already got that working. I just need to auto pop up the file browser somehow.
[04:09:55] <eddyb_> xec: mkay
[04:10:05] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, you cant.
[04:10:12] <imc> hello, is it possible in jQuery to have an animated transition like bold -> plain ?
[04:10:14] <sanjayb> Xotix: ah. this you cannot do.
[04:10:21] <sanjayb> Xotix: this is for certain.
[04:10:22] <WhiteAngel> Can anyone help with examples or something like this for the next task:
[04:10:23] <WhiteAngel> Write a jQuery module that provides the following methods for setting CSS border properties:
[04:10:23] <WhiteAngel> $('#foo').border('1px solid blue');
[04:10:23] <WhiteAngel> $('#foo').border({width: '2px', color: 'red', radius: '1px'});
[04:10:23] <WhiteAngel> $('#foo').border(null);
[04:10:23] <WhiteAngel> $('#foo').border(); // Returns the value of the border property
[04:10:31] <blackspotwiggins> WhiteAngel, dont paste shit here
[04:10:40] <Xotix> it should provide a bad script to auto upload stuff?
[04:10:44] <WhiteAngel> Do you think that this is shit?
[04:10:51] <blackspotwiggins> WhiteAngel, is that your homework?
[04:11:04] <sanjayb> imc: probably not - you'll probably have to just animate font colour to try and achieve the desired effect.
[04:11:08] <WhiteAngel> I already don't have any hometasks...
[04:11:17] <Xotix> and the input get's sandboxed so i can't get the string out of there somehow? hmm
[04:11:30] <imc> sanjayb: ok, thanks. it's animate() the function i'm looking for?
[04:11:44] * gnarf hugs boaseter_
[04:11:47] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[04:11:47] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[04:11:48] <Xotix> sad, so i'll have to create some ugly working around. thanks a lot
[04:11:57] <sanjayb> imc: so, to animate colour, you will need the jquery color animation plugin, i think, but that works - and then with .animate(), yes
[04:12:07] <WhiteAngel> Can anyone recommend where I can find for example sources of jQuery.position() function?
[04:12:08] <imc> ok thanks
[04:12:15] <aaronmcadam> a jQuery module? I think ur tutor is confused
[04:12:18] <fof> the API?
[04:12:19] <blackspotwiggins> imc, since browsers dont have incremental font weight, it might be impossible.
[04:12:26] <gnarf> WhiteAngel: http://github.com/jquery/jquery
[04:12:31] <WhiteAngel> thx a lot
[04:12:42] <sanjayb> gnarf: nice one
[04:12:55] <aaronmcadam> that is stupid
[04:13:01] <gnarf> WhiteAngel: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/offset.js#L169-198
[04:13:03] <gnarf> specifically
[04:13:07] <imc> yeah, could be from classA to removeClass(classA).addClass(classB) instead ?
[04:13:10] <WhiteAngel> thx once more ;)
[04:13:24] <imc> i'll look into that, thanks a lot
[04:13:40] <overbythere> Best way to do rounded corners on <IE9?
[04:14:01] <fof> i think he wanted examples not the source code :p
[04:14:06] <Xotix> aaronmcadam: i have an <img>. if you click on it i auto open the dialog as i just said. Since this does not work in IE, can i somehow wrap the input button around these images? I can't either, correct?
[04:14:18] <xec> overbythere: http://css3pie.com/
[04:14:34] <overbythere> Xotix: surely an input box with a image as the background maybe?
[04:14:49] <blackspotwiggins> overbythere, can't really style file inputs
[04:14:54] <overbythere> thanks xec, i've tried curvycorners, but only works on some areas
[04:15:08] <overbythere> Oh, sorry..FILE inputs, didn't see that bit
[04:15:18] <gnarf> WhiteAngel: $.fn.border = function ( arg ) { if ( $.type(arg) == "object" ) { $.each( arg, function( key, value ) { this.css("border-"+key, value); } ); } else { this.css("border", arg); } return this };
[04:15:37] <sanjayb> Xotix: no.
[04:15:52] <eddyb_> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/XwR6L/
[04:16:25] <WhiteAngel> Thanks a lot!!!
[04:18:53] <oudee> hello, if i have a string like "*first item *second item" how can i convert it into <ul><li>first item</li><li>second item</li></ul>
[04:20:22] <aaronmcadam> WhiteAngel: was that ur homework?
[04:20:29] <oudee> no
[04:21:25] <GuruRAM> .split('*') + jquery templates
[04:21:43] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, that or some test question to apply for a job
[04:21:46] <eddyb_> xec: it was actually quite easy: http://jsfiddle.net/XwR6L/1/
[04:21:59] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: fucking retared question
[04:22:00] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:22:14] <oudee> ah yes split
[04:22:25] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: "write a setter that already exists in the API..."
[04:22:27] <oudee> there isn't any fancy jq way?
[04:22:45] <eddyb_> oudee: use some markdown converter
[04:23:14] <oudee> eddyb, like some extra libraries you mean?
[04:23:20] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[04:23:22] <blackspotwiggins> FANCY
[04:23:30] <Cork> oudee: what separates the items in the string?
[04:23:43] <eddyb_> xec: the divs I can ignore, or use for lines
[04:23:45] <oudee> some char like *
[04:23:46] <Cork> the star?
[04:23:50] <aaronmcadam> oudee: jquery isn't a framework, it doesn't have every possible *fancy* function you can think of
[04:24:02] <blackspotwiggins> quickly, write a split() plugin
[04:24:09] <aaronmcadam> ahhaha
[04:24:14] <oudee> aaronmcadam: but it has lots, and i don't know all of them
[04:24:22] <aaronmcadam> think about it
[04:24:38] <aaronmcadam> jQuery, the DOM utility library
[04:24:45] <oudee> yes, i know how to do it with split, i just forgot the split
[04:24:47] <GuruRAM> IMO native split is fancy enough
[04:24:52] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:25:03] <aaronmcadam> but, but, but a plugin is better
[04:25:06] <Cork> oudee: $('<ul/>').append($.map("*first item *second item".split('*'), function(s) { return $('<li/>').text(s); }));
[04:25:17] <oudee> i was thinkin like the Vim way \1
[04:26:27] <Cork> oudee: you could use regex too
[04:26:40] <Cork> but it would still always end up with you itterating over an array
[04:27:26] <oudee_> damn crappy connection
[04:27:55] <Cork> <Cork> oudee: you could use regex too
[04:27:58] <Cork> <Cork> but it would still always end up with you itterating over an array
[04:27:59] <JWay> how can I access a json object with a variable name? like jsonObj.myVariableName.length; ?
[04:28:24] <Cork> JWay: convert it to javascript object
[04:28:34] <Cork> JSON.parse(jsonObject)
[04:29:20] <JWay> Cork, and then access it like array with []?
[04:29:40] <Cork> . and [] has no difference in js
[04:29:50] <Cork> except that you can't have serten chanacters after .
[04:29:54] <eddyb_> xec: crap, I can't replace the contents of the contenteditable div without having the text cursor reset to the beginning
[04:30:00] <oudee> Cork, theses *item *item2 are part of long string
[04:30:18] <oudee> how to do it with regex
[04:30:24] <Cork> ?eval var a = { key:1}; print(a.key); print(a['key'])
[04:30:27] <bot-t> Cork: 11
[04:30:42] <gnarf> ?js var str = "*first item *second item"; parts = $( str.split("*") ).filter(function() { return this.match(/\S/) }).get(); if ( parts.length ) { console.log("<ul><li>"+( parts.join("</li><li>") )+"</li></ul>"); }
[04:30:43] <bot-t> gnarf: "<ul><li>first item </li><li>second item</li></ul>"
[04:31:00] <Cork> O_o
[04:31:30] <oudee> gnarf but string is like "hgjhsdfjgkjh *first item * seconf item jhdfkj khs d fu hs udhf
[04:31:53] <Cork> oudee: you kinds screwd if its like that
[04:31:53] <gnarf> ?js var str = "hgjhsdfjgkjh *first item * seconf item jhdfkj *khs d *fu hs udhf"; parts = $( str.split("*") ).filter(function() { return this.match(/\S/) }).get(); if ( parts.length ) { console.log("<ul><li>"+( parts.join("</li><li>") )+"</li></ul>"); }
[04:31:54] <bot-t> gnarf: "<ul><li>hgjhsdfjgkjh </li><li>first item </li><li> seconf item jhdfkj </li><li>khs d </li><li>fu hs udhf</li></ul>"
[04:32:15] <Cork> gnarf: the point was that the first should be skipped
[04:32:25] <Cork> or rather parts inbetween should be skipped
[04:32:46] <Cork> oudee: what should makr the end of an item?
[04:32:50] <oudee> but pretty close thanks gnarf
[04:33:09] <oudee> cork nothing hmm space between words
[04:33:27] <Cork> the next star?
[04:33:51] <Cork> you need something to mark where it start and where it ends
[04:33:57] <oudee> ok, i suppose end could be marked by some char
[04:34:13] <Cork> the end could be ex a line break
[04:34:14] <Cork> \n
[04:34:23] <oudee> yes perhaps two stars mark start and end?
[04:34:34] <oudee> yes, line break
[04:34:58] <oudee> after all <ul> makes a line break
[04:35:25] <sx2020> Cork: How could I send variables to my pop() function?  If I define the function as pop(variable), variable automatically assumes [object PopStateEvent]
[04:35:27] <Cork> something like/\*([^\n]+)*/g should work then
[04:35:43] <Cork> sx2020: you can't really
[04:35:54] <Cork> sx2020: you would have to use an inline event to wrapp your function
[04:36:01] <Cork> *inline function
[04:38:59] <Dirkos> I have an onclick on a TD element
[04:39:09] <Dirkos> how can i check which number element of the TR it is?
[04:39:20] <StevenCodes22> Cork &gt; would be unicode right ?
[04:40:28] <antgel_> i'm using jquery ui css class .ui-widget-content in some of my divs, as it makes them look nice and uniform.  but how can i override some of those attributes?  e.g. that class forces a white background which i don't always want
[04:40:29] <antgel_> in firebug, the id atttributes get overriden by the class :(
[04:40:34] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy way to put a hunk of html code inside of a javascript object, so I can pass json data to format it into html? i'm generating a list of formatted data and need a 'template' to base it off of.... it would be nice to avoid the kludgy string syntax - having macros (ie {id}, {name}, etc) would be niceb
[04:41:23] <NoReGreT> shouldn't $().append(<b>one</b>) in a loop output the html n times ?
[04:42:01] <tomasm-> NoReGreT, dont you need to put something inside the $() ?
[04:42:34] <xec> NoReGreT: what are you appending to
[04:43:00] <eddyb_> xec: any idea how I can get and set the position of the cursor?
[04:43:06] <NoReGreT> nevermind, i found the issue
[04:43:19] <eddyb_> http://jsfiddle.net/timdown/vXnCM/ shows me how to set it (somewhat)
[04:43:59] <xec> eddyb_: sorry, i don't know
[04:46:49] <eddyb_> I found this: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jCaret
[04:47:47] <mindis|wurk> sounds useful, manipulating selections in javascript is pure pain
[04:48:19] <mindis|wurk> and that's even when you forget IE support ;)
[04:51:18] <Dirkos> how can i find which subnode (array element) a node is from its parent?
[04:51:51] <overbythere> xec: works terribly, some elements work some don't, elements within elements break..scrolling is not possible..just overall terrible
[04:51:53] <overbythere> I hate IE!
[04:53:10] <nFFF> Dirkos, by its index?
[04:53:33] <Dirkos> yeah
[04:53:36] <xec> overbythere: have you heard of "progressive enhancement"?
[04:53:49] <Dirkos> i click on a node (click event) but how can i know which index it is from parent
[04:54:06] <overbythere> xec: :p yes, however some elements just completely disappear for no apparent reason, I just don't get how this can be this complicated ..
[04:54:18] <Cork> oudee: http://jsfiddle.net/j9G2c/1/
[04:54:41] <nFFF> ?index
[04:54:42] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:54:49] <nFFF> ?position
[04:54:50] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[04:54:50] <xec> overbythere: i'd recommend you let browser that don't support rounded corners simply do not have them ;)
[04:54:56] <xec> browsers*
[04:55:08] <nFFF> Dirkos, I think position is what you want
[04:55:11] <overbythere> xec: I would love to say that, however its the boss who says he wants it
[04:55:24] <Dirkos> ah nahh i can do a $(node).parent().index()
[04:55:27] <Dirkos> nFFF thnx!
[04:55:55] <xec> overbythere: maybe he won't if you explain how much it costs him in development time to support outdated browsers
[04:56:10] <overbythere> xec: I'll try heh. :) thanks for your help
[04:56:34] <xec> overbythere: and most likely, someone with an old browser and no round corners will never know that they should be round and thinks it still looks good ;)
[04:57:22] <xec> overbythere: that said, i've had no issues with css3pie myself, but i wouldn't use it too much (like slap rounded corners on *everything*)
[04:58:36] <Ahrengot> Hey Guys, can anyone explain to me why JS Lint is not accepting the following jQuery code:
[04:58:38] <Ahrengot> (flag)? $(this).slideDown(speed, easing) : $(this).slideUp(speed, easing);
[04:59:05] <Ahrengot> Error message is: "Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression"
[04:59:12] <xec> context?
[04:59:26] <Ahrengot> 'flag' is a bolean.
[05:00:05] <Ahrengot> Here's the context: http://pastebin.com/ty8zjYnH
[05:00:07] <xec> Ahrengot: maybe it expects ternary to be used with assignments only
[05:02:17] <Ahrengot> maybe… It just seems wierd to me that JS complain about this.
[05:02:28] <Ahrengot> sorry JS Lint. There are no JS errors.
[05:03:19] <NoReGreT> what should I put in order to prevent a link from being a link... i forgot
[05:04:05] <overbythere> xec: our designers just found the rounded corner idea..so everything has it. Ha. and the client is a power company..they only have IE6
[05:04:23] <overbythere> not allowed to upgrade, don't want to upgrade & don't know how to upgrade
[05:05:09] <NoReGreT> nevermind, i found it
[05:05:33] <xec> overbythere: well, in that case you're screwed. let them know IE6 does not have round corners, end of story ;)
[05:05:39] <overbythere> haha
[05:05:41] <overbythere> :)
[05:06:12] <ves> where I can post a problem and its solution ? I haven't any account on sdk sites
[05:06:57] <xec> ves: you want a pastebin? tried jsfiddle.net ?
[05:07:18] <Ahrengot> overbythere haha sounds tough. :)
[05:07:45] <xec> Ahrengot: what about something like this http://pastebin.com/xBwarZdT
[05:08:30] <ves> xec: ok, but how users can search a solution without know the full address?  http://jsfiddle.net/ccAwB/3/
[05:08:48] <sanjayb> Ahrengot: do you need to put flag inside () ?
[05:09:16] <sanjayb> Ahrengot: how about: flag ? ... does it give the same lint error? (of course, also, does it still work?)
[05:09:27] <xec> ves: it's a pastebin, not a help site. maybe try stackoverflow for that
[05:10:20] <Ahrengot> xec: Thanks a lot. That works perfectly. Didn't know you could do ternary without the ()'s
[05:11:11] <Ahrengot> xec: Also didn't know this was the same as $(this) within jQuery callbacks. Sweet!
[05:11:31] <xec> within jquery plugins, yes :)
[05:12:18] <Ahrengot> You just made my code shorter, more readable and JS-Lint approved. You're a trooper!
[05:13:31] * xec rewards himself with some m&ms
[05:23:23] <Sebah> hey guys... I have a question/issue ( it's not totally jquery related, but it has something to do with it ). it can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9516808/jquery-plugin-and-integrating-google-maps-with-autocomplete
[05:30:05] <]Darker[> hi guys
[05:30:06] <]Darker[> :)
[05:31:15] <]Darker[> I am trying to make a sprite animation using jquery. I have 3 images underneath a div. I wish that, every second the visibility on each images turn to off and just one of them is visibile. Any ideas to implment that?
[05:31:47] <xec> ?demo @ ]Darker[
[05:32:11] <xec> bot-t: are you confused by the brackets?
[05:32:12] <Sonu> language know to develop own jquery
[05:33:24] <xec> ]Darker[: there are many ways surely. if you whip up a quick demo at jsfiddle.net with what you have so far you will probably get some suggestions
[05:35:01] <Sebah> xec anything for me?
[05:35:44] <xec> Sebah: to be honest i don't really understand your question
[05:36:22] <xec> some maps and some buttons do some stuff
[05:37:09] <Sebah> xec if you open the jsfiddle and click on the 'Map placeholder' you'll get the unstyled toolbox
[05:37:42] <xec> ok
[05:38:09] <antgel_> so, like any jquery newbie, i'm starting to investigate the world of plugins.  totally bewildering selection, wow!  anyone got any lists of "recommended" plugins, that is to say are there any plugins that are generaly ubiquituous?  (i know the question's a bit vague)
[05:38:13] <xec> brb
[05:39:18] <antgel_> being less vague, my app will have a requirement to present several forms as dialogs / alerts / overlays / lightboxes / whatever you want to call them.   would appreciate a clue as to a good way to do this either with jquery ui or jquery plugins?
[05:39:37] <Sebah> xec: thanks!
[05:41:11] <SlinQ> antgeL_ use jQuery UI's base plugins first, only add third party plugins if you need them
[05:41:20] <SlinQ> jQuery UI has a great dialog widget
[05:41:41] <SlinQ> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[05:42:05] <antgel_> flowplayer tools has a good vibe about it
[05:42:15] <antgel_> SlinQ: thanks.  not sure how i missed that one #headache
[05:42:42] <antgel_> SlinQ: it's that old catch-22, don't know what can be done with plugins, don't know what all the plugins do :)
[05:43:31] <SlinQ> anything can be done, Javascript is turing complete :)
[05:43:32] <antgel_> ah, flowplayer looks like a jquery ui alternative *hides*
[05:43:44] <Sebah> xec: I've updated the css + html so it looks a bit cleaner -> http://jsfiddle.net/rcbnG/1/
[05:46:05] <antgel_> SlinQ: you think i'm expecting to write any Javascript? ;)
[05:50:16] <xec> Sebah: back, so - what is the question/issue?
[05:51:32] <Sebah> xec: I've posted the question on stackoverflow ( http://goo.gl/Vj6tB ). The question's there & the link to the updated jsfiddle.
[05:52:07] <xec> Sebah: yes, i read that, and don't know what you want - replace what with what?
[05:53:23] <guy> Hello, quick question. I am using draggable. On event 'stop' I am trying to get $(this).parent();, but this gives me parent *before drag* not after. I've also tried $(ui.helper).parent()
[05:53:34] <guy> -ui question.
[05:54:46] <Sebah> xec: so I have an HTML markup in which there's already a google map ( embeded using iframe ). that specific div has a trigger above it. when the trigger it's clicked it pops the toolbox. Inside the toolbox there's one input file, one map and one submit button ( these are the stuff that we're actually using now ). when you start typing an address/postcode/etc in the input you get the autocomplete
[05:54:46] <Sebah> working. if you chose one of the suggestions the map updates and drops a pin in the right position. Now I want the plugin to grab the map we just updated and replace the one from the HTML.
[05:55:37] <xec> inside the iframe?
[05:56:21] <Sebah> xec: instead of the iframe :)
[05:58:07] <oudee> anybody happen to know if it's correct syntax to place<ul>'s inside <p> like <p><ul><li>hjh</li></ul></p>?
[05:58:38] <SlinQ> oudee: can't see anything wrong with that
[05:58:45] <xec> Sebah: so, you just want insert the new map and remove the iframe (if it's not removed already)?
[05:58:51] <oudee> is it valid in strict?
[05:58:55] <davorin> does jquery support touch events? or do I have to use jquery mobile?
[05:59:25] <Sebah> xec: exactly :). But the new map is generated in a strange way ( div inside of div inside of another div - see where I'm going? )
[05:59:31] <claudio> in HTML4 DTD P's must contain inline elements only, so that is not correct
[05:59:41] <claudio> oudee, ^^
[05:59:48] <claudio> in HTML5 only God knows :)
[05:59:58] <claudio> (I really miss DTD's)
[06:00:12] <oudee> are they gone?
[06:00:21] <claudio> who?
[06:00:25] <claudio> my friends?
[06:00:29] <oudee> dtd strict?
[06:00:42] <oudee> i'm outdated what goes on in html
[06:00:42] <claudio> oudee, HTML5 has no DTD
[06:00:51] <SlinQ> HTML5 is lovely
[06:01:08] <oudee> i'm still on html 4
[06:01:09] <NoReGreT> how can I apply easing to toggle(func(), func()) ?
[06:01:09] <SlinQ> i'm already dancing on the grave of HTML4 and it's not even dead yet
[06:02:56] <antgel_> SlinQ: the jquery ui dialog is actually pretty flexible, i guess one has to dive into the options :)
[06:03:35] <xec> Sebah: the code is a little much to wade through - you have a reference to the new map's DOM element?
[06:03:36] <SlinQ> jQuery UI dialog is excellent :)
[06:03:40] <SlinQ> jQuery UI in general is excellent
[06:04:02] <SlinQ> although I do wish they'd make ThemeRoller opensource
[06:04:40] <SlinQ> the jQuery UI CSS framework is very powerful, it'd be nice to be able to integrate a theme builder into my own projects without having to build one from scratch
[06:05:19] <rworth> SlinQ: we're working on a standalone+headless version
[06:05:30] <SlinQ> yay :D
[06:05:49] <Sebah> xec: I don't think I do ( I'm sorry, but I'm a sort of a novice in JS... )
[06:06:02] <rworth> track at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39787461/ThemeRoller%20Rewrite
[06:06:13] <xec> Sebah: well, how is the new map created
[06:06:24] <SlinQ> aah thanks rworth, must've missed that page in my browsing of the wiki
[06:06:26] <Field> hello world!
[06:06:35] <xec> hello Field!
[06:08:00] <guy> I have question for jquery-ui and draggable: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9517519/get-element-selector-in-the-event-stop
[06:08:44] <xec> guy: why do you have all the code on one line?
[06:08:44] <rworth> guy: let me take a look
[06:08:50] <guy> To summarize: I am using draggable. On event 'stop' I am trying to get $(this).parent();, but this gives me parent *before drag* state, while I need after drag state parent.
[06:08:58] <rworth> a jsbin.com or a jsfiddle.net would help
[06:09:05] <muka> alhoa
[06:09:14] <rworth> dragging itself doesn't change the parent
[06:09:23] <rworth> it just changes the x, y position
[06:09:26] <rworth> not the position in the dom
[06:09:35] <rworth> if you want to change the position in the dom, that's up to you
[06:09:41] <rworth> for example, you could combine with droppable
[06:09:56] <xec> guy: do a console.log(ui), see if you can find it there
[06:10:02] <rworth> and in the drop event you could call .append or .appendTo on the draggable
[06:10:09] <muka> is there method to know if an event has some handler just registered to it?
[06:10:22] <xec> guy: might only be if you're using droppables
[06:10:29] <Sebah> xec: using the Google Maps API autocomplete ( http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/autocomplete.html )
[06:10:34] <guy> dam it. I didn't think that it only changes the position.
[06:11:08] <rworth> imagine a draggable being moved to end up being over 8 elements, which one would it "land on"?
[06:11:22] <rworth> that's what droppable is for, to create a drop target for draggables
[06:11:43] <guy> I see. Thank you for exolaining.
[06:11:47] <rworth> np
[06:13:20] <muka> Does if( ! $('p').trigger() ) {  /* not binded */   };  makes sense ?
[06:15:39] <xec> Sebah: http://jsfiddle.net/rcbnG/2/
[06:16:05] <nFFF> muka, perhaps check the length
[06:16:19] <nFFF> Im not sure what type of object trigger returns
[06:16:38] <xec> Sebah: a start.. problem is, if i clone the map canvas instead of move it, it becomes a static map without a marker etc
[06:16:38] <nFFF> if( ! $('p').trigger().length ) {  /* not binded */   };
[06:16:53] <muka> mh, the length in this.event ?
[06:19:14] <oudee> if(!$("p").attr("length")) perhaps?
[06:19:56] <oudee> if(!$("p").css("length")) i think perhaps?
[06:19:57] <muka> it return $('p')
[06:20:45] <muka> no I want to know if there is at least one event binded to an element
[06:20:48] <adrianp> is it possible to select a div i've created with $(...).append()? $('#parent').append($('<div').attr('id','child')); $('#child').whatever
[06:20:55] <quicksilver> muka: which event?
[06:21:08] <Sebah> xec: hmmm.. and there's no possible way to include the new map as an iframe, right?
[06:21:08] <muka> http://jsfiddle.net/YABZU/1/
[06:21:28] <muka> any, else i push a default one
[06:21:30] <xec> Sebah: might be, not sure
[06:22:03] <oudee> adrian, dynamically created?
[06:22:25] <Sebah> xec: thanks mate. it's a start :)
[06:22:34] <adrianp> oudee: yes
[06:22:37] <xec> Sebah: just to demonstrate what happens with clone: http://jsfiddle.net/rcbnG/3/
[06:22:59] <oudee> adrian, with live i think it works
[06:23:05] <NoReGreT> what is used to change  a string to first letter uppercase ?
[06:23:24] <muka> adrianp: $('#parent').append($('<div').attr('id','child')).children('#child')
[06:23:26] <quicksilver> muka: no official way as far as I know
[06:23:38] <muka> :(
[06:23:41] <Sebah> xec: makes sense. thanks!
[06:23:42] <quicksilver> muka: you have to understand how it's implement and cheat by looking in the events structure
[06:24:08] <quicksilver> muka: best answer is to keep track of it yourself so you alreayd know.
[06:24:55] <quicksilver> muka: john resig explained how it worked here ; http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/
[06:25:23] <oudee> NoReGreT: toUpperCase();
[06:25:31] <nFFF> muka cant you use
[06:25:34] <nFFF> datA() method
[06:25:35] <quicksilver> muka: see also the answer here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515069/jquery-check-if-event-exists-on-element
[06:25:52] <adrianp> muka: great, i'll have .children() return the object and store it in a var
[06:25:54] <adrianp> should work i think
[06:26:36] <muka> $.data() yes it is !
[06:27:20] <quicksilver> yes, as described in both the links I posted :)
[06:27:30] <muka> Yes, thank you
[06:27:35] <NoReGreT> oudee: can't find it
[06:27:54] <oudee> NoReGreT: can't find what?
[06:28:08] <muka> I was searching for something else I think :J thanks again
[06:28:23] <NoReGreT> oudee: toUpperCase, and in the doc i mean.
[06:28:53] <quicksilver> NoReGreT: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase
[06:28:58] <quicksilver> NoReGreT: (not a jquery question)
[06:29:15] <muka> NoReGreT: http://phpjs.org/functions/ucfirst:568
[06:30:30] <oudee> would be great if php and js developers would use same names for common functions
[06:31:05] <quicksilver> as long as all of them were js's names and none were php's.
[06:31:11] <adrianp> nuked: thx that worked
[06:33:08] <oudee> like string length in js and php and other examples too just can't remember right now
[06:35:00] <oudee> somebody mention earlier about converter libraries and i was wondering are there some jquery libs/plugins for converting strings into html?
[06:35:08] <airstrike> right, because 'parseFloat' is a great name
[06:37:03] <oudee> i'm not looking anything massive just something that would convert normally typed text into html and has ability to add lists and images?
[06:37:35] <johnkpaul> oudee: jQuery itself will convert a string into dom elements
[06:37:56] <quicksilver> I have only the faintest idea what you think "convert normally typed text into HTML" means
[06:38:08] <muka> I would try to use a code highliter engine
[06:38:08] <quicksilver> however, try a google search for "jQuery rich text editor"
[06:38:12] <johnkpaul> !eval jQuery("<div>test</div>")
[06:38:13] <quicksilver> maybe that's what you meant.
[06:38:27] <johnkpaul> !help
[06:39:04] <quicksilver> "jquery code highlighter" also gives many results
[06:39:05] <oudee> yes, i know those rich text editors, but is there like very basic basic editor kind thingy
[06:39:08] <quicksilver> google is your friend.
[06:39:28] <oudee> hehe, a lottle more advanced
[06:39:33] <oudee> little
[06:52:58] <dirkpennings> is http://detectmobilebrowsers.com a good way to check desktop vs. mobile? or are there other best practices?
[06:56:29] <SlinQ> dirkpennings: better to make a site that works on both :)
[06:56:43] <SlinQ> highly recommend this book on the subject:
[06:56:45] <SlinQ> http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design
[06:58:21] <oudee> fluid designs you mean?
[06:59:08] <SlinQ> basically yeah, people are calling it "responsive" now
[06:59:18] <SlinQ> no fixed widths, everything in percentages or 'em's
[06:59:33] <SlinQ> also you can use CSS 3 media queries to change your page layout depending on screen size
[06:59:34] <oudee> or have they invented  something new and evil on mobile that terrorises strict html?
[07:00:03] <SlinQ> they have invented many new and evil things on mobile, but responsive web design isn't one of them
[07:00:08] <oudee> ic, so i'm not so outdated as i thought
[07:01:52] <dirkpennings> SlinQ: yeah ok, but I want to disable my Flash movies on mobiles and tablets :)
[07:01:58] <oudee> whats the relatio between different browsers now, is ie still an evil one?
[07:02:08] <SlinQ> yes IE is still evil ;)
[07:02:15] <oudee> hmm i'm apparently still on ie7
[07:02:42] <SlinQ> dirkpennings - use something like modernizr to detect the presence of html5 video and use it instead? :)
[07:02:53] <SlinQ> oh dear ie7 is most definitely evil
[07:03:14] <SlinQ> although there is a solution now, one i implemented today actually
[07:03:18] <SlinQ> chromeframe :)
[07:03:22] <oudee> it's good to check compatibility though
[07:03:46] <oudee> whats that
[07:03:51] <SlinQ> yes indeed, i've got separate VMs with IE6, IE7 and IE8
[07:04:08] <SlinQ> chromeframe is a plugin for IE that allows you to have your site rendered by chrome
[07:04:11] <SlinQ> inside IE
[07:04:25] <SlinQ> you can install it without administrative access
[07:04:33] <SlinQ> i've dropped IE support completely now :)
[07:05:02] <SlinQ> http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/
[07:05:09] <oudee> yes, but that doesn't help with compatibility
[07:05:21] <SlinQ> it helps you not have to worry about compatibility :)
[07:05:40] <SlinQ> if you're able to say what I've said "either install chromeframe, get a proper browser, or go away"
[07:05:46] <oudee> it's like 0.00001% of ppl will load it
[07:06:08] <SlinQ> you'd be surprised, chromeframe is gaining traction pretty rapidly
[07:06:40] <SlinQ> anyone using the web in IE <9 would be foolish not to install it really
[07:06:59] <SlinQ> i don't serve fools :)
[07:07:25] <oudee> i can't install any new ie cause vista refuses
[07:07:29] <xec> hopefully wXP will die soon so no-one has a reason not to upgrade IE
[07:08:27] <SlinQ> hopefully :)
[07:08:43] <SlinQ> IE is the third most popular browser on many of my sites now (even those that fully support it)
[07:09:01] <SlinQ> this pleases me :D
[07:09:56] <xec> third? really?
[07:10:06] <oudee> isn't google becoming a new evil with all it's data cathering tendensies?
[07:10:13] <SlinQ> yes google is the new microsoft
[07:10:17] <SlinQ> but at least chrome works properly
[07:10:37] <SlinQ> xec: firefox first, chrome second
[07:10:46] <xec> nice
[07:11:19] <oudee> i use firefox too, it's free and alwas installs nicely
[07:11:46] <SlinQ> firefox beats IE on 100% of my sites
[07:11:49] <oudee> thunderbird has one issue though
[07:12:08] <SlinQ> which issue is that?
[07:12:11] <oudee> it goes nuts with large amount of mail
[07:12:15] <SlinQ> mm yes that is true
[07:12:28] <SlinQ> i've been unable to move messages out of my inbox for quite a while
[07:12:30] <oudee> and i have mails for about a decade
[07:12:41] <SlinQ> ye me too
[07:12:49] <SlinQ> 103452 emails in my inbox and counting heh
[07:13:12] <xec> each one with a couple of megs worth of attachments? :D
[07:13:41] <oudee> yes, i just recently find out that you can actually unattach attachments
[07:14:04] <SlinQ> that is handy
[07:14:16] <xec> detachments
[07:14:26] <SlinQ> thunderbird seems to parse emails every time you open them
[07:14:34] <oudee> yes, sorry bad english have to guess words
[07:14:57] * linkbuck hi all
[07:15:07] <SlinQ> thunderbird's not great, i've actually submitted a patch to it that closed an issue that'd been open just under 10 years
[07:15:17] <SlinQ> in the process i noticed that most of their code is still a legacy from netscape
[07:15:22] <SlinQ> all the function names have NS_ as a prefix heh
[07:15:55] <oudee> i wonder how old code there is in mail servers
[07:20:55] <ribot> hey
[07:21:30] <ribot> when i change the css background for an element with jquery, its hover background doesn't work any more
[07:21:59] <hexa___> inline styles take precedence so the old rule is ignored
[07:22:07] <hexa___> add a css class instead?
[07:23:02] * linkbuck http://ef741e91.linkbucks.com Welcome
[07:28:36] <jeffsmykil> I have this weird issue where the code is only being executed if i set a break point
[07:28:58] <jeffsmykil> Anyone ever run into this?
[07:30:25] <jeffsmykil> It isn't an ajax call
[07:32:49] <mattyh88> i'm getting this as a json response: https://gist.github.com/40aed7a9f741def81b10
[07:32:49] <mattyh88> and I'm trying to loop through these like this: https://gist.github.com/a67b38c00e8acb93e10f but for some reason it gives me undefined for index 0 but the correct date for index 1
[07:33:58] <ribot> thanks hexa___
[07:34:32] <mattyh88> *correct data
[07:42:07] <Xotix> how can i append something to the beginning? i have a set of html elements which i need to give an img so the user sees, this is editable. maybe i can do this just with css? I would add an <img> to every element and make it: position absoulte: top: 0 left: 0;, better ideas?
[07:42:39] <SlinQ> $.prependTo() ?
[07:42:43] <Gaia> Hey guys, anyone experience with embedding a youtube channel in your website?.
[07:43:01] <Xotix> thanks
[07:44:37] <Sebah> Gaia: experience what?
[07:46:17] <shwaiil> Q: I have a inputbox that is not clickable, I just can't put any data there...i'm not sure what it may be. it's not readonly, etc :P It may be something preventing it, but I'm out of ideas on how to debug this, any tip ?
[07:46:39] <SlinQ> shwaiil could be another block element over the top of it?
[07:46:45] <SlinQ> use firebug or another DOM inspector to check
[07:47:09] <shwaiil> SlinQ: tks . yeah i'm allways looking in to to console, but...ive run out of solutions for this
[07:47:17] <shwaiil> tryed position absolute, indexing 10000000000000000000
[07:47:26] <shwaiil> not working on FF
[07:47:35] <shwaiil> i've developed this in chrome, I have to double check that
[07:48:51] <SlinQ> text inputs have a 'disabled' state as well as a 'readonly' state
[07:49:02] <SlinQ> if either of them is set, you won't be able to put any data in
[07:50:05] <shwaiil> SlinQ: there's no atributes like readonly etc
[07:50:21] <shwaiil> its simple <input type="text" value="" name="somename" />
[07:50:42] <SlinQ> start removing other stuff from your page until it starts working again :)
[07:51:03] <Xotix> How cna i select elements from more the none class? select all which got foo oder foo1
[07:51:15] <SlinQ> xotix $('.class,.class2')
[07:52:34] <Xotix> SlinQ hmm then i was correct. Thanks :)
[07:52:56] <shwaiil> works on chrome though :P
[07:53:36] <shwaiil> and ie :T strange
[07:54:17] <SlinQ> that is strange
[07:55:10] <SlinQ> if you can condense the problem into a simple jsfiddle.net example I'll take a look
[08:14:38] <aprescott> i have a simple web app which requires basic auth to connect, running at foo.example, and i'm attempting to make a cross-domain request using CORS, from bar.example. i have all the appropriate headers set in the response from foo.example, as can be seen by trying to use $.ajax(url: "http://foo.example", xhrFields: { withCredentials: true }, success: function(data) { console.log(data); }); and it working completely fine when i've already logged into
[08:14:44] <aprescott> foo.example using basic auth. however, i'd like to programmatically enter the user credentials. it seems that (first ensuring you're logged out), trying to use `username: "foo", password: "bar"` in the $.ajax() call causes no request to be attempted, and just gives an error. if you try to set the basic auth credentials using xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic stuffhere"), the OPTIONS preflight fails, presumably because the given
[08:14:50] <aprescott> credentials don't get used for the preflight OPTIONS request
[08:14:53] <aprescott> is this a known problem?
[08:15:03] <aprescott> and/or should this go to #jquery-dev
[08:17:02] <kanzie> hmm I just switched from json to jsonp in $.ajax() and get Uncaught ReferenceError: jquery173295340543534_3214932 is not defined, what am I missing. Doesn't jQuery add its own callback-method?
[08:36:59] <Gates> anyone know anything about the stickam facebook app tab?
[08:47:58] <StevenCodes22> Whats a good code example rss feed for jquery ?
[08:48:57] <microhxo> Guys, i need to check all checkboxes but they need to be of the id #chkRead  here is my current code that checks everything! http://paste2.org/p/1921562
[08:49:23] <RandalSchwartz> microhxo - you can't have more than one thing with the same id
[08:49:25] <RandalSchwartz> do you mean class?
[08:49:33] <microhxo> shit
[08:49:47] <microhxo> thats right, the id needs to be unique.
[08:51:06] <microhxo> Ok i need everything with the class checkedGridRead to be checked
[08:51:10] <microhxo> how can i do that?
[08:51:16] <nights``> what is a good way to on submit of a form copy content of a div to the value field of a hidden input?
[08:52:16] <eddyb> how can I store the position of the caret in a contenteditable element, and then restore it?
[08:53:09] <microhxo> RandalSchwartz: How can i check all checkboxes of the class 'checkedGridRead' with this code? http://paste2.org/p/1921562
[08:53:36] <eddyb> I need to replace the contents with a re-highlighted version of the text, and have the caret in the same place
[08:53:58] <RandalSchwartz> lemme see if I can find my code to do that.  I don't think you can do it that way
[08:54:30] <RandalSchwartz> ... $(nodes).find('input[name^=upload_pay_]').prop('checked',checked);
[08:54:38] <RandalSchwartz> that's how you check things
[08:54:44] <RandalSchwartz> .prop('checked', checked)
[08:54:55] <RandalSchwartz> ooh wait. that
[08:54:59] <RandalSchwartz> second thing is a variable
[08:55:16] <RandalSchwartz> var checked = $(this).prop('checked');
[08:55:34] <RandalSchwartz> I'm using this to make all checkboxes be the same as the "master" checkbox
[08:55:57] <RandalSchwartz> anyway... look at .prop() - that has the key
[08:56:32] <eddyb> .prop?
[08:56:58] <io__> hi i am looking for some kind of scroll to replace the default one with just a <> (up and down) arrows to place in a div corner
[08:57:23] <RandalSchwartz> that's for microhxo
[08:58:17] <microhxo> thanks RandalSchwartz  ill look at prop
[08:58:19] <eddyb> wow, and I've been using .attr this whole time
[08:58:56] <eddyb> I guess it's not bad if you don't do complicated stuff with it
[09:07:45] <peol> geoffw8: thanks! had a blast writing it, will definitely do another one. not sure if i'll do a follow up or cover a whole other area yet.
[09:08:06] <geoffw8> peol: well, I sure would appreciate a follow up, thats for sure
[09:08:16] <geoffw8> this lunchtime I sat down, and it actually for once made sense to me
[09:08:18] <yezariael_> hey everyone, I would like to register a .click event on an element on $(document).ready(), but the element will not yet exist at that point. I will load it with load() later. is that possible?
[09:08:34] <Zzaichik> repetition is king
[09:08:40] <geoffw8> peol: I'm a rails guy, minus any real javascript knowledge. Looking to integrate some things from early this evening
[09:08:51] <geoffw8> Zzaichik: me? if so, for sure
[09:08:52] <Zzaichik> ?.on() @yezariael_
[09:09:00] <peol> geoffw8: yeah, i've heard several say i should do a follow up, so it's leaning towards that
[09:09:05] <Zzaichik> ?on
[09:09:08] <Zzaichik> do it
[09:09:13] <peol> bot-t: hello
[09:09:20] <Zzaichik> geoffw8: yeah that repetition thing was for you. :)
[09:09:24] <geoffw8> peol: ahh great, I'll be sure to read it!
[09:09:37] <geoffw8> Zzaichik: yeah, always the way. I gave up a job last year to become a programmer, reaping the benefits of it now
[09:09:41] <geoffw8> doing it every day helps infinitely
[09:10:55] <geoffw8> but yeah, thanks again peol
[09:11:03] <geoffw8> gonna hang around I think
[09:11:12] <peol> geoffw8: glad you enjoyed it :)
[09:12:17] <Zzaichik> ?delegate
[09:12:17] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:12:23] <Zzaichik> now you work...
[09:12:23] <geoffw8> I guess, just so you know the reason I liked it: being a programmer I don't need to learn the basics, I mean, I "get" it, but then again not being an expert means I don't really know how to piece together the info from the jquery docs
[09:12:32] <geoffw8> peol: it was like all you needed to know in a one pager
[09:12:52] <geoffw8> was great to learn the syntax
[09:13:01] <geoffw8> and how it all links up
[09:13:14] <geoffw8> my colleague laughed that I didn't know what function(){ } parentheses were
[09:13:18] <nights``> what is a good way to on submit of a form copy content of a div to the value field of a hidden input?
[09:13:28] <geoffw8> *were for
[09:14:21] <peol> geoffw8: we all have to learn it some time :) let me know if you have any questions.
[09:14:28] <geoffw8> will do
[09:17:04] <]Darker[> guys, I have a stupid question :\
[09:17:26] <yezariael_> @Zzaichik what does that have to do with my question? So I could use on("click") instead of click(). I tried that, but it still doesn't work as expected. Can an event be registered without the element existing?
[09:17:28] <]Darker[> I wrote a function and I user $('.myClass).myfunction();
[09:17:33] <]Darker[> and it works as expected
[09:17:52] <]Darker[> the function never ends (I need an infinite loop)
[09:18:06] <]Darker[> but i would like tu stop it in some occasions
[09:18:32] <]Darker[> how can I force $('.myClass') to stop executing my function?
[09:19:42] <yezariael_> @]Darker[ I suppose you could make a member variable in your class as a boolean and on a call to MyClass.stop() you change it to false. then check for that variable in your loop
[09:21:25] <]Darker[> basically u suggesting to create a lock
[09:22:08] <]Darker[> I was confident that jquery implementent something like .exit() or,bho
[09:22:09] <]Darker[> you know
[09:22:18] <ajpiano> ]Darker[: you probably don't "need an infinite loop"
[09:22:22] <ajpiano> fwiw.
[09:22:40] <]Darker[> ajpiano: it's a frame animation :)
[09:22:45] <]Darker[> I need it
[09:22:54] <ajpiano> ... what is a "frame animation"
[09:23:09] <]Darker[> one image after another
[09:23:13] <]Darker[> to create like a movie
[09:23:19] <ajpiano> :o
[09:23:33] <ajpiano> there's no reason that should need to be implemented as an "infinite loop"
[09:23:43] <]Darker[> there is a reason
[09:23:50] <ajpiano> and furthermore, the exepectation that jquery would have a command like "magically exit my process" is a bit bizarre
[09:24:00] <]Darker[> just assume that there are 10 images
[09:24:13] <]Darker[> after the 10th, load the 1st again
[09:24:25] <]Darker[> well, why not ? :)
[09:24:27] <]Darker[> it's so cool
[09:24:30] <ajpiano> lol
[09:24:50] <ajpiano> because jquery is javascript, not a team of magical gremlins who infect your entire codebase and magically do whatever you need
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> a slideshow is not an "infinite loop"
[09:24:57] <]Darker[> do you think that implement something like $('.myClass').myfunction().kill(); is so hard?
[09:25:01] <ajpiano> um, yes.
[09:25:35] <]Darker[> it's not properly a slideshow
[09:25:37] <]Darker[> anyway
[09:25:39] <ajpiano> a setInterval or recursive setTimeout implementation is not what anyone would call an "infinite loop"
[09:25:41] <]Darker[> tnx for the suggestions :)
[09:26:03] <]Darker[> i will use a lock
[09:26:54] <ajpiano> ]Darker[: you have to code your thing so it works. creating some methods that let you pause the thing, etc.
[09:27:09] <]Darker[> yeah :(
[09:27:23] <]Darker[> it's exactly what I am trying to avoid :P
[09:27:29] <ajpiano> yeah, it's disappointing to have to program as opposed to hope for libraries to implement magical methods that Read Your Mind™
[09:27:36] <yezariael_> so, can anyone tell me how to register an event to an element that does not yet exist?
[09:27:36] <]Darker[> ahhahahahaha
[09:28:09] <]Darker[> ajpiano: come on, i said "stupid question" for that :D
[09:28:14] <]Darker[> be flexible
[09:28:20] <ajpiano> haha, i missed that part :p
[09:28:26] <]Darker[> ahahha
[09:28:29] <]Darker[> fair enough
[09:32:12] <Jeff_D> I'm trying to find the jQuery API for working with DOM Selection objects (what Opera calls a Selection, and Webkit browsers know as a DOMSelection). No matter how I slice and dice my Google or jQuery API searches, I keep getting told about jQuery's CSS-based selectors, which are NOT the same thing. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[09:32:33] <ajpiano> there isn't anything in jquery core for working with ranges and stuff
[09:33:10] <ajpiano> Jeff_D: http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[09:33:12] <Jeff_D> well, that answers that… the workaround is easy enough; I just was surprised I couldn't find it in base.
[09:33:28] <]Darker[> ok, I discovered that my ability to create lock does not work in Js: any suggestion to understand why the animation never start? http://pastebin.com/VN0a5P0h
[09:33:38] <Jeff_D> ajpiano: that's extremely helpful. Thanks a heap!
[09:34:06] <ajpiano> ]Darker[: uhmm
[09:34:33] <ajpiano> you realise jquery has a lot of built in stuff for queuing effects
[09:34:33] <]Darker[> i set the variable at line 49

[09:38:11] <ajpiano> ]Darker[: unfortunately i can't take the time right now to work through a more reasonable implementation of this with you
[09:38:41] <ajpiano> but in general, when you want to do something like this
[09:38:52] <ajpiano> it makes a lot more sense to have step 1 trigger step 2, step 2 trigger step 3, etc
[09:39:08] <ajpiano> intead of like "pileup a buch of functions that you want to later have run in the order they were set up"

[09:51:16] <A2_> anyone awake and willing to assist?.... http://pastebin.ca/2123282
[09:51:25] <Zzaichik> Dude totally called me out
[09:51:48] <A2_> this should be so simple
[09:51:51] <ajpiano> A2_: you can't concatenate two jQuery objects together
[09:52:00] <Zzaichik> did I not help him? Okay, not really. But I can't help it if I had actual work that needed my attention.  Azezerial = dick
[09:52:02] <A2_> i see that
[09:52:05] <A2_> what do i do?
[09:53:13] <ajpiano> var liHeaderSpan = $('<span/>', {    "className": 'contacts_wrapper' }).append( liHeaderC1 ).append( liHeaderC2 ); would wor
[09:53:30] <ajpiano> A2_: also be careful using 'class' without quotes around it
[09:53:35] <ajpiano> or prefer className
[09:53:44] <ajpiano> A2_: class is technically a reserved word in JS
[09:53:47] <ajpiano> and IE will barf on it.
[09:53:50] <A2_> o
[09:53:52] <A2_> awesome
[09:53:54] <A2_> 100 thanks
[09:55:50] <ravenzz> ajpiano this is cool. I wasn't aware of that. So can I create a new jquery object and set its properties in such way?
[09:55:59] <ajpiano> indeedles
[09:56:03] <ajpiano> you can even bind event handlers up in there
[09:56:07] <NoReGreT> i have a string with newlines, how can I replace them with <br> ?
[09:56:44] <ravenzz> ajpiano in the js way?
[09:56:51] <ajpiano> yep
[09:56:58] <ravenzz> oh ok cool
[09:57:05] <ajpiano> $("<span>", { click: function() { alert("wat"); } );
[09:57:15] <ravenzz> so "nope" :p
[09:57:39] <eddyb> so
[09:57:41] <ravenzz> with js way I meant $("<span/>", { onclick: function(){ }});
[09:57:41] <ajpiano> wat
[09:57:45] <ajpiano> lol no
[09:57:48] <eddyb> how can I replace the contents of an element
[09:58:01] <eddyb> and reset the caret (text cursor)?
[09:58:08] <ravenzz> anyway I am interested in the attr thing
[09:58:25] <eddyb> the element is a textarea or a contenteditable div
[09:58:32] <__composern> $('#id').keypress(function(){ alert( $(this).val() ) });
[09:58:41] <ravenzz> eddyb cursor:auto  for the caret
[09:58:45] <ravenzz> i guess
[09:58:45] <__composern> when i press 1 it does nothing
[09:58:51] <eddyb> ravenzz: caret not cursor
[09:58:57] <__composern> if i press 11 it only allows 1
[09:59:11] <eddyb> ravenzz: not the mouse, but the blinking line in the text
[09:59:21] <NoReGreT> is there any nl2bbr() in jquery ?
[09:59:33] <ravenzz> eddyb demo?
[09:59:39] <eddyb> ravenzz: dude
[09:59:43] <eddyb> a textarea
[09:59:49] <__composern> any help ?
[09:59:53] <eddyb> if it's focused, it has a blinking line
[10:00:05] <eddyb> that's called a caret
[10:00:16] <ravenzz> ok what's wrong with that?
[10:00:18] <ravenzz> you don't get it?
[10:00:24] <ravenzz> you want to focus it?
[10:00:30] <eddyb> what I need is to store its position
[10:00:33] <ravenzz> I mean the textarea?
[10:00:34] <eddyb> and reset it later
[10:00:39] <ravenzz> ah. Dunno
[10:00:41] <ravenzz> then
[10:00:41] <eddyb> after I change the contents
[10:01:02] <ajpiano> eddyb: http://www.examplet.buss.hk/jquery/caret.php
[10:01:05] <eddyb> nobody seems to know, and it's getting annoying
[10:01:18] <eddyb> ajpiano: that works with textarea, but doesn't with contenteditable
[10:01:33] <ajpiano> eddyb: http://code.google.com/p/rangy/
[10:01:52] <ajpiano> i've used that with contenteditable i think, not  necessarily sure if to do what you want
[10:02:53] <Chopps> hey guys, im having trouble getting values from a json object: http://jsfiddle.net/ncbXW/ what i want to do is get the values from the array selected from the select element, can anyone help me out pls? thanks in advance
[10:03:21] <eddyb> ajpiano: I need to get the text of the element, do syntax highlighting on it, then replace the original content with the newly highlighted one
[10:03:38] <eddyb> in the process, the caret goes to the beginning. I need it to stay where it was
[10:04:45] <eddyb> ajpiano: http://rangy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/position.html
[10:04:54] <eddyb> that looks like what I want
[10:05:15] <ajpiano> sweet
[10:05:31] <eddyb> omg that lib is big
[10:05:41] <eddyb> seriously, does it need more than 50 lines?
[10:05:45] <ajpiano> cause there's so much xbrowser wackiness etc
[10:06:02] <ajpiano> eddyb: it's open source, pick out whichever 50 lines you want and find out if it works
[10:07:57] <simple__> I am having an issue with thickbox close buttons.  If you open a thickbox inside a thickbox, the close button on the inside box does not work.  any work arounds to this?
[10:08:24] <eddyb> ajpiano: rangy doesn't actually have methods to set anything
[10:08:35] <kara_sweets> can someone help me figure out why this short little snippet, doesnt actually generate anything? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Rqv/1/
[10:08:47] <eddyb> I tried a few more google searches and I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510296/get-set-caret-position-in-contenteditable-iframe-firefox
[10:09:43] <Kottizen> Hi, does anyone know of a (Jquery) script that allows the user to align boxes below and above each other (Y-wise)? I'd like to use it so that users can change the positions of their 'widgets' on their profiles.
[10:10:04] <simple__> however the esc key still works, how to I get the close button to act on the same command the esc key does?
[10:12:24] <WebDragon> instead of this: var title = $(this).find("h3").text(); I'd like to do something like $(this).find("h1 or h2 or h3 in that order").text(); -- possible?
[10:15:20] <eddyb> ajpiano: great, doesn't work
[10:16:23] <WebDragon> simple__: might I recommend http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ ?
[10:16:32] <ajpiano> sorry.
[10:16:40] <WebDragon> heya ajpiano
[10:16:43] <eddyb> that range thing is relative to the element the selection is in
[10:16:50] * WebDragon slides over the carafe of DragonCoffee™
[10:17:19] <eddyb> ajpiano: considering my thing has <span>s for highlighting, it's a mess
[10:18:12] <ajpiano> eddyb: are you really trying to do syntax highlighting on a contenteditable thing and have it wor?
[10:18:20] <ajpiano> eddyb: why not use codemirror?
[10:18:52] <eddyb> because I've seen its internal magic, just like ACE
[10:19:09] <tomasm-> hi, is it at all possible to have persistent sockets in jquery/javascript/ajax? I'm coming up with a 'chat' plugin for my site and was wondering if there was a way other than polling every 15/30/60 seconds
[10:19:35] <eddyb> ajpiano: codemirror 1, which is what jsfiddle uses, is done with a contexteditable
[10:20:13] <eddyb> err, contenteditable
[10:20:42] <ajpiano> what i was getting at was "why reinvent the wheel"
[10:21:06] <eddyb> because it's not a wheel yet :)
[10:21:38] <ajpiano> wouldn't it be better to contribute to it and improve it rather than be like "oh there is some flaw or another that i don't like so i'm gonna write a new thing from the ground up"
[10:22:20] <NoReGreT> is there any nl2br() (\n to <br>) in jquery ?
[10:22:33] <ses1984> hi- i'm trying to troublsheet/debug a package that uses jq-ui to try to provide draggable table columns, but it doesn't seem to be working as intended
[10:22:35] <eddyb> I have already done my syntax highlighting, by converting Kate Syntax files
[10:22:38] <eddiemonge> NoReGreT: replace
[10:22:44] <WebDragon> find("h1|h2|h3").text() does not work. find("h1,h2,h3').text() grabs the text from all three
[10:22:54] <WebDragon> is there any way I can do what I outline above?
[10:23:07] <ses1984> http://dpaste.com/710035/ -- i keep getting errors at line 26, saying that ui.absolutePosition is undefined
[10:23:29] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: you would have to check each one
[10:24:01] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: so an if/then/else ? or a switch ? (does jquery have switch? not that I recall)
[10:24:03] <eddiemonge> ses1984: what is ui thats being passed in? does it have an absolutePosition property?
[10:24:15] <ses1984> i dont know if this might be related, but it shows that ui.absolutePosition is "removed in callbacks" between 1.7 and 1.8
[10:24:23] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: javascript does have switches but if else if else are better
[10:24:29] <_eddyb_> ajpiano: and it's different from what ACE or CodeMirror use, so I thought I would make a quick editor
[10:24:32] <ses1984> eddiemonge: it doesn't have absolutePosition, it just has originalPosition
[10:24:40] <eddiemonge> ses1984: then thats why it is undefined
[10:24:49] <_eddyb_> but, as usual, I'm getting stuck with little problems
[10:24:52] <y3di> can you animate text changing?
[10:24:55] <ajpiano> _eddyb_: "so i just thought i'd make a quick editor' doesn't sound like "famous last words" to you ?
[10:25:00] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: have you looked at comet or websockets?
[10:25:02] <WebDragon> *nod* ok. I'm kind of surprised there's no |, or-like functionality in find() but I suppose that's a nontrivial problem
[10:25:05] <WebDragon> thanks
[10:25:21] <ajpiano> WebDragon: there's , in find, which is "or-like"
[10:25:22] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: there is sorta. filter
[10:25:26] <eddyb> ajpiano: "I thought I'd start working on my dream IDE" does
[10:25:32] <ses1984> well, i know why it's undefined...we kind of just walked through a tautology there...i'm trying to figure out why the code acts like it should be defined with it isn't,
[10:25:34] <WebDragon> ajpiano: there's what in find?
[10:25:37] <ajpiano> WebDragon: the "problem" is that text always concats everything together
[10:25:46] <WebDragon> ajpiano: all I saw was the comma
[10:25:46] <ajpiano> there's comma
[10:25:51] <eddiemonge> ses1984: because you are calling it
[10:25:52] <ajpiano> that's what i was saying
[10:25:54] <WebDragon> ah yeah, sorta or like
[10:26:00] <WebDragon> but in my case it grabs all three at once
[10:26:09] <ajpiano> WebDragon: exactly
[10:26:09] <WebDragon> more and-like than or-like
[10:26:17] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, I am now
[10:26:25] <WebDragon> mmm
[10:26:39] <ajpiano> WebDragon: "or" means "meets any of the conditions in the list of conditions"
[10:26:47] <ajpiano> WebDragon: and means "meets all of the conditions"
[10:26:50] <ajpiano> comma is or, not and.
[10:27:06] <eddiemonge> its more like and-or
[10:27:13] <ajpiano> whatever that is
[10:27:20] <eddiemonge> grab this and/or that and/or this other one
[10:27:21] <WebDragon> ajpiano: I see.. is there a particular way to grab only the first element it finds as a .text() if I use commas?
[10:27:29] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: yeah yeah
[10:27:31] <WebDragon> I see
[10:27:36] <WebDragon> kinda nifty
[10:27:38] <ajpiano> WebDragon: .first().text() ?
[10:27:41] <WebDragon> if that was what I needed
[10:27:43] <ScorpionHD> Quick question, I can fire functions on .ready right?
[10:28:02] <eddiemonge> ScorpionHD: thats how you are supposed to yes
[10:28:04] * WebDragon slaps his face muttering something about how he can't imagine how he overlooked .first()
[10:28:10] <ajpiano> ScorpionHD: yes.
[10:28:16] <WebDragon> got the dang jqapi.com right here
[10:28:35] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: but if h1 exists but doesnt have text, first().text() will still be empty
[10:28:53] <WebDragon> oh crap
[10:28:55] <WebDragon> hm
[10:28:57] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ ScorpionHD
[10:28:58] <bot-t1> ScorpionHD, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[10:29:34] <Chopps> hey guys, im having trouble getting values from a json object: http://jsfiddle.net/ncbXW/ what i want to do is get the values from the array selected from the select element, can anyone help me out pls? thanks in advance
[10:29:37] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: well, I'll just have to live with that
[10:29:55] <WebDragon> thanks guys :)
[10:30:12] <ScorpionHD> ok i guess my sytanx is messed up? $(document).ready(function () {$('#social-slider').animate({margin-left:'0px'}, 1000);});
[10:30:20] <eddiemonge> Chopps: how are you getting that "json"?
[10:30:39] <raj> anyone familiar with jstree?
[10:30:46] <eddiemonge> ScorpionHD: marginLeft
[10:31:02] <ScorpionHD> BAH I knew Unexpected "-" meant something
[10:31:03] <Chopps> eddiemonge: i have a matrix on php, then i json_encode it
[10:31:04] <ScorpionHD> thanks guys
[10:31:29] <ajpiano> WebDragon: $.grep( $("h1,h2,h3").map(function() { return $(this).text();  }).get(), function(t) { return !!t;  })[0] will get you the first element that actually has text, lol
[10:31:33] <eddiemonge> Chopps: and how does the js get it?
[10:32:02] <WebDragon> ajpiano: jeez
[10:32:22] <Chopps> eddiemonge: var json = <?php echo $dataTemp; ?>;
[10:33:34] <eddiemonge> Chopps: dont do that if $dataTemp was json_encode'd
[10:35:53] <WebDragon> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/B7GvJ/ brilliant if a bit obscure looking LOL
[10:36:35] <shanez> using query UI to load tabs via ajax… how can i get the tab that the ajax query was called for… anchor always seems to be empty on ajax calls
[10:36:35] <ajpiano> WebDragon: technically it would bomb if the result of $.grep led to an empty array, so you'd want to guard against that
[10:37:07] <WebDragon> ajpiano: why the comma after the .get() ?
[10:37:19] <WebDragon> oh wait that's inside the map
[10:37:21] <WebDragon> nevermind
[10:37:22] <ajpiano> because the result of the .map...
[10:37:25] <WebDragon> yea
[10:37:36] <Chopps> eddiemonge, then what should i do?? thats the only way i was able to find to get the object from php to js
[10:37:48] * WebDragon surreptitiously cleans the dust off his laptop screen so he can see more clearlt
[10:37:50] <WebDragon> clearly*
[10:38:11] <eddiemonge> Chopps: what are you trying to do?
[10:39:46] <Chopps> eddiemonge: i want to append the values from the array that matches the selection to a select element
[10:39:59] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: ajpiano what about http://jsfiddle.net/5LGx6/
[10:40:10] <eddiemonge> oh wait
[10:41:00] <eddiemonge> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/5LGx6/1/
[10:42:15] <eddiemonge> something simple
[10:42:31] <eddyb> ajpiano: ok, any idea how I can do .indexOf() on a jquery object?
[10:42:49] <raj> ajpiano, eddiemonge, I don't see how jstree gets its data when just using the core http://www.jstree.com/documentation/core
[10:42:53] <ajpiano> eddyb: what are you looking for, a given element's position in the jQuery object?
[10:43:23] <eddyb> yeah, considering a jQuery object is an extended array
[10:43:24] <AdvoWork> anyone here use datatables? im getting the data(the sql returns in correct order) but the datatables seems to ignore that order lol
[10:43:25] <ajpiano> eddyb: see ?index
[10:43:26] <bot-t1> eddyb, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:43:31] <eddyb> thanks :)
[10:43:38] <ajpiano> eddyb: $(".someElements").index( someElementReference );
[10:44:21] <eddyb> yepp, got it
[10:44:41] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/5LGx6/2/ gets interesting here
[10:45:01] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: how so?
[10:45:16] <WebDragon> precedence
[10:45:20] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: returns exact same thing: http://jsfiddle.net/B7GvJ/1/
[10:45:32] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: then change the order of how you want to look for them
[10:45:57] <WebDragon> suppose one does not know which will appear first
[10:46:05] <WebDragon> here's where it starts to get nontrivial
[10:46:25] <eddiemonge> oh ok i didnt know that was a req. ignore me then
[10:46:34] <WebDragon> such as when the client has control of the cms and is presumably an idiot when it comes to adding content
[10:46:47] <WebDragon> I'm just expanding the idea, don't mind me
[10:46:53] <WebDragon> works = works
[10:47:36] <ajpiano> WebDragon: that's why you should use $("h1,h2,h3") or a flavour of that where you know you'll get the results in dom order intead of the order you queried in
[10:47:47] <eddyb> ajpiano: another question and I'm done: how can I replace an element with its contents? including the text children
[10:48:05] <WebDragon> ajpiano: good point
[10:48:16] <eddyb> or just a version of .children() that includes text children
[10:48:30] <WebDragon> too bad I can't do $("#foo").find("h*").first().text();
[10:48:58] <ajpiano> eddyb: are you willing to give the elements a new container?
[10:49:11] <y3di> can you animate a change in text? like with fade in fade out?
[10:49:19] <eddyb> ajpiano: or just .replaceWith
[10:49:21] <ajpiano> eddyb: the getting textnodes is reasonably simple, $("#foo").contents();
[10:49:41] <eddyb> ajpiano: instead of .children()? that's quite helpful, thanks :)
[10:49:45] <ajpiano> the textnodes will go away though if you do other jquery operations on that object
[10:50:09] <ajpiano> eddyb: if you want *just* textnodes you can do .contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType == 3;  }) iirc.
[10:50:25] <WebDragon> when is .live() expected to go away as it is now deprecated ? (jqapi.com should move that to the deprecated section)
[10:51:05] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: it is deprecated
[10:51:24] <eddiemonge> and it is in that section
[10:51:26] <ajpiano> WebDragon: we're not sure if we'll ever outright pull it
[10:51:53] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: look at the official docs http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[10:52:03] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: if you click the Deprecated section on the left on jqapi.com ...
[10:52:07] <WebDragon> not api.jquery.com
[10:52:09] <Eruadan> I just found a nice slide show. For beginners, http://jquerysbestfriends.com/
[10:52:18] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: thats why i said look at the official documentation ....
[10:52:32] <WebDragon> right, which was why I was commenting that someone should move it on jqapi.com ...
[10:52:43] <ajpiano> WebDragon: so contact the guy who runs jqapi.com :)
[10:52:49] <ajpiano> we don't control that site
[10:52:51] <WebDragon> I'd do it myself right now if I had access LOL
[10:53:05] <WebDragon> oh? who's doing it
[10:53:35] <ajpiano> WebDragon: in the kindest of ways, sometimes i do wonder if you have eyes :)
[10:53:56] <WebDragon> *chuckle* well I'm looking at their homepage now :P
[10:54:09] <WebDragon> just wondered if it were anyone that's hangin around in here, before I got there
[10:54:17] * WebDragon isn't a complete idiot.
[10:54:23] <WebDragon> ... some parts are missing, after all =8)
[10:55:37] <jayar> how do i add values and update dynamically? so far i have $("select").change(function() { var pts = $(this).children("option:selected").val(); $("#total").html(pts); } ... but when i select another value, i want to add and change the result
[10:56:00] <darrellf> eddiemonge it was an issue with the html that IE didn't like btw
[10:56:13] <raj> ehem
[10:56:16] <raj> ajpiano?
[10:56:22] <eddiemonge> darrellf: ?
[10:56:31] <shanez> why when i do ajax calls with jquery tabs is there no anchor in the callback function?
[10:56:32] <eddiemonge> jayar: you mean add to the total?
[10:56:44] <NoReGreT> how can I use easing on .toggle(f(),f()) ?
[10:56:47] <ajpiano> raj:  i've never even looked at that plugin and i don't plan to become conversant in its use at this moment just so i can walk you through the docs as i read them.
[10:57:10] <raj> i don't need to know anything except how to pass data to it, without using an additional plugin
[10:57:18] <eddiemonge> $("#total").html(function(i,o) { return o + pts; })
[10:57:20] <MagmaRules> Hi there. I planning on doing an interface that involves dragging elements to a screen and connecting the with lines / arrows. Anyone knows if there is a lib that has this notion of "nodes" and connections?
[10:57:24] <raj> I figure it'd be a pattern you've seen before
[10:57:43] <jeffkiesel> hi all
[10:57:49] <jeffkiesel> super simple question here
[10:57:53] <ajpiano> ?g jsplumb @ MagmaRules
[10:57:54] <bot-t1> MagmaRules, jsPlumb 1.3.5 demo - jQuery - http://jsplumb.org/
[10:58:09] <jeffkiesel> why is my callback function not being executed?  http://jsfiddle.net/gxNmv/9/    only 4 lines of code
[10:58:13] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: thanks thats it =)
[10:58:30] <eddiemonge> jeffkiesel: because addclass doesnt have a callback
[10:58:36] <jeffkiesel> well shie
[10:58:41] <eddiemonge> ?addclass
[10:58:41] <bot-t1> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[10:58:45] <jeffkiesel> thx eddiemonge
[10:59:03] <eddiemonge> jeffkiesel: not everything in jQuery has a callback function
[10:59:04] <jayar> thnx eddiemonge
[10:59:07] <jeffkiesel> so i guess i have to creat my own function that add a class
[10:59:14] <jeffkiesel> how ... dumb?
[10:59:22] <Eruadan> eddiemonge, I want to apologize if yesterday I didn't express myself very well about my background, etc, so you might have taken a wrong idea about what i wanted with jquery. After reading a lot about it today, i found out that jquery is made for me. This is due to my lil background in a imperative language called BASIC, then after i was a lot into flash AS stuff. I just found that all that i needed was imperative library such as jquery, that could l
[10:59:22] <Eruadan> et me write similar ECMA script code. So big ++ to jquery,yay!
[10:59:38] <__composern> hi
[10:59:41] <ajpiano> raj: from looking at the demo page it looks like you *have* to use one of the plugins
[10:59:42] <jeffkiesel> meh
[10:59:47] <ajpiano> to specify what type of data you want
[11:00:00] <raj> ajpiano, oh, ok, that's what I was confused about...thank you
[11:00:08] <raj> i didn't imagine that the core was useless on its own
[11:00:51] <ajpiano> it's not that its useless on its own, its that the plugin seems to be architected that the method of data extraction is always told to it by a plugin
[11:00:56] <kara_sweets> can someone please help me understand wy this doesnt work?
[11:01:05] <jayar> hrmm... eddiemonge... now it just puts the two values together... i.e. 11, 33 instead of adding 1 + 1, +3, +5
[11:01:15] <__composern> what is wrong with this code ?  <input id="testData" type="text" /> <script type="javascript">  $('#testData').keyup(function() { alert('ola');}); </script>
[11:01:15] <ajpiano> probably because the plugin author explicitly wanted to keep all forms of data extraction out of the core
[11:01:18] <jayar> do i need parseFloat()?
[11:01:23] <raj> ajpiano, k, so it's abstracted...i guess that can be good
[11:02:06] <raj> thank you for looking, ajpiano
[11:02:08] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: by any chance do you know of a lib similar to http://ukijs.org/ built with jquery ? =)
[11:02:36] <ajpiano> there's jqueryui, kendoui, jqwidgets, wijmo
[11:03:33] <__composern> important node #testData loaded by ajax
[11:05:11] <jeffkiesel> stillt rying to add a very simple callback here.  why doesn't this work?  http://jsfiddle.net/gxNmv/12/     only 8 lines of code
[11:05:19] <jeffkiesel> anyone?
[11:05:34] <ajpiano> lol jeffkiesel
[11:05:42] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: callbacks are not "magic"
[11:05:46] <MagmaRules> ty ajpiano
[11:05:46] <ajpiano> you have to actually execute them.
[11:05:50] <jeffkiesel> they are today, ajpiano
[11:05:51] <jeffkiesel> haha
[11:05:58] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: first of all, addClass doesn't *need* a callback
[11:06:02] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I'm adding new elements(li) to a ul, dinamically through ajax. Is there an event that is triggered automatically when a new element is added to the dom?
[11:06:02] <ajpiano> it happens immediately
[11:06:18] <rgoytacaz> an ul*
[11:06:19] <rgoytacaz> sorry
[11:06:49] <jeffkiesel> i have a visual effect i want to ensure happens only after addClass, that's why i 'm trying to do this
[11:07:14] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: code you put after an addClass will never happen until after the class has been applied and the dom has reflowed
[11:07:35] <jeffkiesel> ajpiano: ok, so no need for the callback huh
[11:08:12] <eddiemonge> jayar: parseInt or convert it to a int
[11:08:16] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: but for your own edification, http://jsfiddle.net/gxNmv/13/
[11:08:28] <ajpiano> jeffkiesel: but as you can see, it's just.. calling add class and then calling more code afterward
[11:08:51] <jeffkiesel> ajpiano: thanks for the help & good use of 'edification'
[11:09:08] <ajpiano> <--- learned english before js
[11:09:19] <eddiemonge> jayar: +o + pts
[11:10:41] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I'm adding new elements(li) to an ul, dinamically through ajax. Is there an event that is triggered automatically when a new element is added to the dom?
[11:10:52] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: lol sorry to be bugging you so much, by any change you have experience with any of the ui libs?
[11:11:46] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: KendoUI seems well built and fast and reactive =)
[11:12:00] <ajpiano> MagmaRules: i'm dev rel lead for jquery ui
[11:12:04] <ajpiano> and have used it extensively
[11:12:12] <ajpiano> don't have really any experience with  the other ones
[11:12:23] <ajpiano> i'd advise you to make whatever decision you feel comfortable
[11:12:25] <ajpiano> with
[11:12:42] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: ok =) query ui seems too incomplete for my case =) i have worked with it for some time now =)
[11:13:45] <ajpiano> yea i don't know what you're trying to build
[11:13:46] <JBP641> Hi
[11:14:13] <Tumeski> Hello everyone. I have a kinda of a question. I am mind boggeled on one situation I have at the moment and trying to find the right way to approach in order to get this done.
[11:14:19] <JBP641> if I do an onclick function on a radio choice does the value not get set as well?
[11:14:27] <Tumeski> I have done something like this in past, but I just can't come up with right technigue now!
[11:14:30] <MagmaRules> ajpiano: sorry yeah i didnt really say =) Its a GUI design app that allows me to design some simple forms and flows =)
[11:15:03] <MagmaRules> So i need, split panes, detail areas, nodes and connections. List supports and a few other things =)
[11:15:04] <Tumeski> So basically I am creating a system in wich you can reserve a placement for yourself IE a seat at concert etc...
[11:15:08] <ajpiano> MagmaRules: no prob, i'm just saying, i don't want to advocate a solution that may not work for you
[11:15:36] <Tumeski> So now I need to either use image map in order to create rectangles on top of picture and somehow use them with Jquery
[11:16:07] <Tumeski> or create rectangles on the picture some other way. I just can't think any method off hand. Anyone, any ideas?
[11:16:23] <rgoytacaz> Is there an event as 'create' on jQuery core?
[11:18:19] <JBP641> if I do an onclick function on a radio choice does the value not get set as well?
[11:18:48] <johnkpaul> JBP641: it will as long as you don't preventDefault() on the event
[11:18:55] <johnkpaul> if you're using jquery to attach those event
[11:18:56] <johnkpaul> s
[11:18:59] <JBP641> hrmm
[11:19:15] <JBP641> all of my fields are getting set when I POST them but the one radio
[11:19:17] <JBP641> grumble
[11:21:05] <johnkpaul> can you show an example?
[11:21:15] <patrickcamacho> http://jsfiddle.net/pWrvb/5/ anyone have ideas on how to pass the appended div between anonymous functions?
[11:22:22] <johnkpaul> patrickcamacho: that's a lot of code, can you point us to what you mean
[11:23:05] <patrickcamacho> johnkpaul, absolutely... most of it is a plugin... the last like 20 lines are what i'm having problems with, specifically $('img').livequery
[11:23:30] <patrickcamacho> i am appending a div to the body over the image, and trying to remove it when the image is removed
[11:23:59] <johnkpaul> you mean in the set timeout?
[11:24:02] <patrickcamacho> i have the event listeners triggering, but can't find a way to pass the new element between the two annonymous functions given the .livequery plugin
[11:24:30] <johnkpaul> what are "the two anonymous functions"?
[11:24:47] <patrickcamacho> $('img').livequery(function() {
[11:24:47] <patrickcamacho>     $(this).data('overlay', addInlineOverlay($(this)))
[11:24:47] <patrickcamacho> }, function() {
[11:24:47] <patrickcamacho>     removeInlineOverlay($(this));
[11:24:47] <patrickcamacho> });
[11:24:53] <rgoytacaz> Is there an event such as onCreate?! which would trigger when the element is added to the DOM?
[11:24:55] <rgoytacaz> !help
[11:24:56] <johnkpaul> ah
[11:25:07] <patrickcamacho> rgoytacaz, look at livequery plugin
[11:25:17] <JBP641> johnkpaul: I'll paste bin my fields to you.
[11:26:08] <johnkpaul> patrickcamacho: so you want your livequery extension to have this bound correctly, right?
[11:26:43] <johnkpaul> you might want to take a look at this jquery plugin pattern
[11:26:43] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns/blob/master/jquery.extend-skeleton.js
[11:26:58] <johnkpaul> using this.each, you already setup the value of this
[11:27:10] <rgoytacaz> patrickcamacho: is there an reason why such event wasnt added to core yet?
[11:27:36] <ajpiano> rgoytacaz: liveQuery style stuff is really an antipattern and we'll never add it to core
[11:27:55] <patrickcamacho> rgoytacaz: there ya go, i guess
[11:27:57] <ajpiano> if it works for your app, so be it.
[11:28:25] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: is there another way to bind events to new elements being added through ajax?
[11:28:25] <ajpiano> but "when something that matches this selector is added to the dom, do X" is a leading indicator of your app devolving into a bowl of spaghetti
[11:28:26] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: do you have a better idea for listening to whenever any elements of a certain kind are added or removed?
[11:28:32] <ajpiano> rgoytacaz: event delegation
[11:28:43] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: there's also see ?newConent
[11:28:44] <bot-t1> patrickcamacho, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[11:28:44] <ajpiano> ffuu
[11:28:47] <ajpiano> ?newContent
[11:28:47] <bot-t1> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[11:28:50] <ajpiano> but they do the same thing
[11:28:57] <ajpiano> the point is you shouldn't be writing apps that *do* that.
[11:29:21] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: my code is part of a bookmarklet, so i have little control of the original configurations or events being triggered by the page
[11:29:34] <ajpiano> what's wrong with event delegation
[11:30:37] <patrickcamacho> i am not the one adding or removing elements in that scenario... i'm just responding to events happing that i didn't write
[11:30:48] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: My scenario is that of a ajax pagination or endless scroll, which there are events are that run on each child of a ul.
[11:30:49] <ajpiano> so again, what's wrong with event delegation
[11:30:55] <patrickcamacho> can you give an example of what you mean about using event delegation in that scenario?
[11:31:02] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: what would be the "right" way to do it?
[11:31:06] <ajpiano> $(document).on("whatever", fn);
[11:31:50] <ajpiano> rgoytacaz: the right way to do it would be to a) use event delegation so you don't have to bind new handlers for new content or b) initialise the new content when the ajax is complete
[11:31:59] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: i See, that would be called when the ajax fires to add more elements. not after.
[11:32:09] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: I see.
[11:32:14] <ajpiano> it would be fired after the elements are added
[11:32:28] <patrickcamacho> apiano: sure, that wouldn't be a problem, but i am not of any events for creation or removal of a new element
[11:32:45] <patrickcamacho> *not aware
[11:32:50] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: why do you need events for when the elements are added are removed for your bookmarklet
[11:33:00] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: there are dom mutation events but they are severely in flux
[11:33:03] <tazrover> If I'm using the $.post() method, do I need to designate the type of data that I'm sending.  For example, I'm sending a JSON key: "value" in the data field.  Does .post() know I'm sending JSON?
[11:33:33] <patrickcamacho> dynamic content (specifically endless scroll pages), and i need to append a div to each one
[11:33:48] <patrickcamacho> same goes for removal of content
[11:34:15] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: you're building a bookmarklet for pages that already have an infinite scroll built in?
[11:34:15] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: not by my code, but by the actual page the bookmarklet has been activated on
[11:34:20] <patrickcamacho> yes
[11:34:47] <ajpiano> piggybacking on top of any particular infinite scroll implementation or just "all of them"
[11:35:26] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: the bookmarklet is unrelated to the infinite scroll, but that is a test case where it becomes necessary to listen to the addition of elements from the site, and the removal too when there is ajax pagination.
[11:35:55] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: essentially, for every image on the page, i need to overal a div that allows the user to add the image to a 3rd party site (once they've activated the bookmarklet)
[11:36:10] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: tricky.
[11:36:24] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: first of all, you know that liveQuery/newContent only work on content that was added by jQuery
[11:36:37] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: very tricky... and the divs should be added and removed if the image are added/removed
[11:36:38] <ajpiano> so the idea that liveQuery is a silver bullet here is probably a false thing.
[11:36:45] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: i was not aware of that
[11:36:50] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: that is good to know
[11:37:13] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: i could do a .live method for selection... bad practice, but i don't see a better choice
[11:37:16] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: they work by just duckpunching the jquery dom manipulation methods to like, do a check after those methods were called for the presence of matched selectors in the injected content
[11:37:35] <znf> god damn it, I have to remove "matched" from my highlight keywords, #jquery triggered it like 50 times already
[11:38:08] <ajpiano> lol, znf i accidentally set my nick to be "in" last week, highlight went out of control
[11:38:31] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: i would say that you should just write your bookmarklet and not have it handle images that come in after the bookmarklet was activated
[11:38:47] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: and instead, make it work so that if the bookmarklet is activated again, it only does it to elements that haven't already had the beavhiour applied
[11:39:02] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: otherwise you are just trying to solve a complicated, unrelated problem with your bookmarklet
[11:39:12] <ajpiano> which is "how can i know when new elements come into the dom regardless of the source"
[11:39:40] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: yea, that seems to be what everyone does, and i have that down... i'm concerned though because of complicated sites like pinterest (there are a million of them) that don't use the idea of a static page load
[11:39:56] <patrickcamacho> seems to cripple the effectiveness of the bookmarklet
[11:40:04] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: why not just do "all images on the page when bookmarklet is activated"
[11:40:53] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: the bookmarklet was supposed to be an augmented kind of experience, so the user could browse the page like regular and then click on images to add them as they saw fit. if the bookmarklet doesn't keep up with the new loaded content, it is a little worthless
[11:41:26] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: a unicorn is meant to be an augmented kind of horse, so that a horse can fly
[11:41:34] <ajpiano> but it simply doesn't exist :)
[11:42:17] <patrickcamacho> ajpiano: pushing the bounds of what we believe to be possible results in the coolest stuff though
[11:42:46] <ajpiano> sometimes the coolest stuff just results in freezing to death
[11:43:07] <patrickcamacho> fair enough
[11:43:44] <A2_> unicorn is augmented for the purpose of impalement, pegasuses are augmented to fly
[11:44:13] <Emn1ty> does anyone know a good way to get the same functionality as a PHP foreach such as foreach ($array as $key => $value)?
[11:44:16] <ajpiano> patrickcamacho: http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers you should read about that as well
[11:45:14] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: for in is close
[11:45:37] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: or if you dont care where it works see ? mdc foreach
[11:45:38] <bot-t1> Emn1ty, Array forEach - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a provided function once per array element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[11:46:27] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: ok, the only other thing I found was $.each(array, function()); but I think it would be simpler to just use a generic for in javascript and set the $val manually for reference.
[11:46:49] <dmexs> anybody willing to lend a hand for a moment with history.js?
[11:48:37] <dmexs> i can get pushState to work in changing the url on after an ajax request but I don't know how to restore my initial content when the browser's back button is pressed
[11:53:35] <Gates> How would I go about creating a input form (where there are about 25 of them in blocks of 5), and when a hex color is inputed into the input the color is filled in a box next to it
[11:54:06] <gehsekky> i'm trying to put some global ajax event handlers (ajaxError, ajaxComplete) in an external file, but they don't seem to work. it works fine if i put it on the main page though. anyone else experience this?
[11:54:52] <eddiemonge> Gates: have you looked at the html5 color picker?
[11:55:20] <eddiemonge> gehsekky: how/when are you calling them and you are including that page right?

[12:04:19] <z3yo> I want to get the new value of an autocomplete field, so I tried with the change event  to get my value with attr("value") or val() but nothing works, any idea ?

[12:06:50] <z3yo> eddiemonge, yeah, actually u can get the value only after a second change
[12:07:05] <z3yo> I just discovered that

[12:08:11] <NoReGreT> eddiemonge: toggling a link, i read the docs yeah,
[12:09:16] <NoReGreT> eddiemonge: i'm using .toggle(f(),f()) form, and there is no easing there

[12:11:31] <rgoytacaz> ajpiano: is there a way to get the diff from two selector arrays?
[12:11:54] <djuggler> so .live() has always worked well for me. I can't seem to get a simple alert box to fire when I click on an input field using .on(). Is there a secret?
[12:12:09] <rgoytacaz> $('.product-grid li') - $('.product-grid li.sold') ?
[12:12:27] <djuggler> $("#tblaccountsanddistributions caption").on("click", "#clickme", function(){  alert('boo'); });
[12:12:59] <eddiemonge> djuggler: is #clickme a child of that caption element?
[12:13:12] <eddiemonge> does that caption element exist in the dom when you bind that to it?
[12:13:22] <djuggler> yes
[12:13:30] <rgoytacaz> Is there a way to get the diff from two selector arrays? Eg; $('.product-grid li') - $('.product-grid li.sold') ? anyone?
[12:13:38] <eddiemonge> rgoytacaz: what do you want it for?
[12:13:39] <djuggler> I tried $("#clickme").... earlier with fail.
[12:13:41] <ezio> anyone know why, only in firefox, am i getting an error ... typeerror: elem.nodename is undefined
[12:14:00] <eddiemonge> djuggler: that should work then so if its not, there must be something else going on
[12:14:05] <rgoytacaz> eddiemonge: I need that diff to call .trigger on a reduced set of elements.
[12:14:09] <eddiemonge> ezio: try .each
[12:14:19] <_gates> Can you do like $(this '.class') or something a class under this?
[12:14:22] <eddiemonge> rgoytacaz: filter
[12:14:25] <_gates> or is it like a parenting this i am missing
[12:14:29] <djuggler> since I'm going to dynamically add elements I'm assuming I'll have to use  .on("event", selector....   for delegated stuff
[12:14:38] <eddiemonge> _gates: $('.class', this)
[12:14:49] <ezio> eddiemonge, then i can't break;
[12:14:49] <djuggler> eddiemonge: cool. At least I know this isn't a syntax problem. Thanks!
[12:14:51] <eddiemonge> _gates: or $(this).find('.class')
[12:14:54] <_gates> so thats the class under this evne though its after
[12:14:56] <_gates> ah
[12:15:03] <eddiemonge> ezio: yes you can

[12:16:00] <_gates> http://jsfiddle.net/PLJhV/
[12:16:11] <_gates> i cant get them to do just the one they are grouped with
[12:16:13] <peterschmidler> Why doesn't this show the text for 2 seconds? $(".text").eq(1).show(); $(".text").eq(1).delay(2000).hide();
[12:16:20] <_gates> unless its not inside? and i just am dumb?
[12:17:18] <rgoytacaz> eddiemonge: For this case, $('.product-grid li') - $('.product-grid li.sold'), would I have to use the function to check if the element has the class sold? or is there an easier way?
[12:18:09] <_gates> eddiemonge:  can you do the next instants of that class instead of the one withinside?
[12:18:31] <peterschmidler> How can I show a hidden element for 2 seconds on click.
[12:18:38] <mats_> i have a drop down menu which hides ceratin tbodys with switch, but how do i make sure that they the hidden elements appear if the switch case is to display elements that have been hidden? it's like they're gone. now i just use display before the switch but it doesn't feel to be the right way
[12:20:06] <gehsekky> eddiemonge: nvm. i just made a jsfiddle with it and the external file is working so it must be something in my code that is suppressing the global events from firing

[12:26:23] <NoReGreT> eddiemonge: you mean .toggle(f(),f()).toggleslide() ?
[12:27:03] <someprimetime> is it possible to use reader.onload to readAsBinaryString() with ajax() instead of recreating the xhr object or do i have to explicitly do that?

[12:54:18] <eddiemonge> __composern: your welcome
[12:54:18] <monk12> Is there a good tutorial/explanation of  'on' vs old 'live' way. i had a dynamic form coming in through ajax. and the old "$('form.ajax').live('submit', doStuff() );" works, but .on() doesn't
[12:54:37] <eddiemonge> ?on delegate @ monk12
[12:54:39] <bot-t1> monk12, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:54:45] <eddiemonge> hmm
[12:54:55] <eddiemonge> ?delegation
[12:54:55] <bot-t1> If you try to attach an event to an element that doesn't exist in the DOM yet, it will not bind. You need to delegate the event handler to a parent that is in the DOM to look for its children. Look at .on() or delegate() for more info
[12:55:55] <eddiemonge> monk12: read the delegate docs and then use .on() and just switch the order of the first two params
[12:56:10] <monk12> ok. I'll take a look
[12:56:37] <monk12> The jquery docs seems to say both .live and .delegate should be superceded with .on. so assuming swaping order of 1st two params with .on simulates the old .delegate?
[12:56:59] <monk12> I'll take a closer read now though. only skimmed both docs.
[12:57:34] <jaquerys> hola amigoes
[13:01:44] <monk12> eddiemonge, one last quick question. i see how the params are swapped... for a before like this: "$('.ajax_div_wrapper').live('mouseover', showHyperlink() );" should it become "$('body').on('.ajax_div_wrapper', 'mouseover', showHyperlink() );". I have alot of dynamic checks like that. so would be a few things added to a few .on's... "$('body').on('input.auto-ajax-submit[type="radio"]', 'click', ajaxSubmitForm() );"
[13:02:31] <monk12> i mean would i just have many lines adding onto $('body').on(...);
[13:02:59] <eddiemonge> those are backwards
[13:03:15] <eddiemonge> $(document).on("mouseover", ".selector", callback
[13:03:46] <eddiemonge> but you should be delegating to the closest parent that is in the DOM
[13:05:07] <stones_> Hi guys. I have a drop down menu for people to choose the color of shirt they want. Instead I'd like to replace the drop down with a color pad/pallete. Is there a tutorial on how I can do this?
[13:05:19] <jayar> is this right for a button? $("submit").click(function () {
[13:05:48] <monk12> ok cool, thanks eddiemonge
[13:07:35] <__composern> eddiemonge:  for another question how can add  inputbox keyup function ?
[13:09:31] <shmup> hey guys. jeditable, read that i can change the default actions of clicking outside of editable areas..
[13:09:44] <shmup> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[13:10:07] <__composern> var t= $('#DATA').find("#inputID");  t.keyup(function(){ alert( t.val())});
[13:10:08] <shmup> as the bottom of that article states. options[onblur]
[13:10:20] <eddiemonge> jayar: no
[13:10:31] <eddiemonge> ?on @ __composern
[13:10:31] <bot-t1> __composern, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[13:29:40] <ravenzz> i would agree
[13:29:40] <ajpiano> m4xx: the load event doesn't bubble
[13:29:46] <ajpiano> you can't use delegate/on with it
[13:29:49] <BinaryKitten> m4xx are both pages in and out of the iframe the same domain?
[13:29:58] <m4xx> BinaryKitten: yes
[13:30:22] <m4xx> what would be the proper way to do so with a dynamically added iframe?
[13:31:03] <BinaryKitten> only close to possible way to get what you want is to do $(function(){ $(window.parent.document).trigger('load'); }); and even then it won't guarentee across all browsers
[13:31:14] <dmexs> is there a way to have query reload all .click even catchers? or should i just throw it inside a function?
[13:31:38] <BinaryKitten> dmexs what do you mean by reload?
[13:31:48] <DrShoggoth> when passing a function into something like map() is there any way to access variables outside of the function scope?
[13:32:00] <m4xx> actually $('#some-iframe').load(function(){...}); seems to fail also
[13:32:06] <DrShoggoth> like the calling object?
[13:32:10] <DrShoggoth> calling function...
[13:32:26] <BinaryKitten> DrShoggoth  yes
[13:32:37] <dmexs> BinaryKitten: I mean I'm loading content via ajax and that should trigger the same click event but it doesn't, does that mean i have to do the $('ajaxClickClass').click() thing all over again
[13:32:41] <ravenzz> ?newcontent @ m4xx
[13:32:41] <bot-t1> m4xx, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[13:33:07] <Mkop> I have a page firing off an AJAX request. most of the time the AJAX request comes back with data that I deal with, but sometimes it 302s to a login page. how can I detect that, or handle it gracefully?
[13:33:20] <BinaryKitten> ?.on @ dmexs
[13:33:21] <bot-t1> dmexs, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:33:36] <Mkop> I tried $("html").replaceWith(responsetext) but it didn't work
[13:33:42] <rmelo> hi guys
[13:33:56] <rmelo> i have a strange jquery behavior
[13:34:02] <rmelo> anyone can have a look?
[13:34:26] <BinaryKitten> dmexs use $(parentDivSelector).on('click','ajaxclass', function() {});
[13:34:39] <BinaryKitten> that way it's always bound, and cleaner too
[13:35:06] <dmexs> BinaryKitten: will i have to run that again if I inject new content into a div that has the ajaxclass?
[13:35:34] <BinaryKitten> dmexs in principle no
[13:35:42] <DrShoggoth> BinaryKitten, : so my structure is basically    _.each( array_of_hashes, function( hash ) { dosomething( hash.value1, function( blah ) {  PARENT.hash.done = true } ) } )    <------- thats what I am trying to do
[13:35:55] <m4xx> $('#some-iframe')[0].onload = function() { ... } seems to work just fine though =\
[13:35:57] <DrShoggoth> in dosomething I want to set a value in the hash above it
[13:36:05] <BinaryKitten> you'll need to make sure the 1st item (parentDivSelector) is the common ancestor
[13:36:07] <DrShoggoth> but i dont have access in dosomething
[13:36:37] <DrShoggoth> i can access it is window.array_of_hashes but I wont know what step i am on
[13:36:50] <BinaryKitten> DrShoggoth what is parent.hash?
[13:36:59] <BinaryKitten> surely that's just hash?
[13:37:02] <DrShoggoth> BinaryKitten, it is made up,  it would be the hash
[13:37:06] <dmexs> BinaryKitten: okay I think I see what you're saying, so if I perform the .on() on a #content div, any new content that matches the original class selector will work, even if loaded after the fact
[13:37:22] <BinaryKitten> DrShoggoth have you tried just using hash.done = true; ?
[13:37:39] <BinaryKitten> dmexs not quite
[13:37:52] <DrShoggoth> oh, it is accessable, even though it is not passed to the function... wow ok nvm tyvm
[13:38:03] <dmexs> BinaryKitten: ah, I'd have to rerun it for the newly injected content?
[13:38:16] <BinaryKitten> dmexs no not that either.. two seconds
[13:38:22] <dmexs> BinaryKitten: kk
[13:39:00] <BinaryKitten> DrShoggoth JavaScript scope is inside out up to window.. eg from your function, to it's creation scope, to its creation scope etc until it hits window
[13:39:27] <BinaryKitten> dmexs, ok say you have lots of divs each with the class "ajaxClass"
[13:39:35] <dmexs> ok
[13:39:44] <BinaryKitten> all of those divs are children on a div say with the ID of content
[13:39:45] <DrShoggoth> hm... it doesn't actually affect the hash i am eaching,  its a new copy of each hash
[13:39:51] <dmexs> ok
[13:40:17] <BinaryKitten> dmexs the .on would be $('#content').on('click', '.ajaxClass', fn(){});
[13:40:31] <dmexs> correct
[13:41:03] <BinaryKitten> that would trigger on the click of ajaxClass as long as the item with class "ajaxClass" is inside "#content"
[13:41:20] <BinaryKitten> if the divs with the classes change etc, you won't need to rebind
[13:41:29] <BinaryKitten> because the binding is on #content
[13:41:36] <dmexs> oooh sexy
[13:41:43] <dmexs> got it, thanks!
[13:41:49] <BinaryKitten> it just listens to clicks on items with class "ajaxClass"
[13:41:49] <BinaryKitten> :)
[13:41:59] <dmexs> very nice
[13:41:59] <BinaryKitten> this is event delegation
[13:42:26] <dmexs> this is more effective then setting up a .click() event on the actual ajaxClass right?
[13:42:30] <dmexs> because I won't need to rebind
[13:42:38] <BinaryKitten> .on is the 1.7+ version of .bind, .delegate and .live all rolled into 1 nice item
[13:42:53] <BinaryKitten> dmexs massively more so, it's 1 hook
[13:43:08] <BinaryKitten> instead of 1 hook per item that has the ajaxClass class
[13:43:54] <dmexs> got it, thanks a lot!
[13:44:00] <BinaryKitten> no worries :)
[13:44:11] <BinaryKitten> yay I helped someone!
[13:45:18] <dmexs> :)
[13:47:14] <Eruadan> does anyone have links to unusual implementations of jquery? Something really cool, or maybe a list of them?
[13:47:25] <jedimind> google
[13:47:53] <Eruadan> i was, but i can't find much, just examples of the plugins itself, but not real life sites
[13:48:07] <jedimind> Eruadan, http://tympanus.net/codrops/
[13:48:18] <jedimind> specifially http://tympanus.net/codrops/all-articles/
[13:50:49] <Eruadan> jedimind, thanks, but that is the type of site i found also. I wanted to see a real world cool implementation, not just the plug in code
[13:51:04] <DrShoggoth> ok, i'm all sorted
[13:51:12] <jedimind> these arent really out of the box plugins
[13:51:25] <jedimind> but more just showcasing ideas
[13:51:44] <Eruadan> ok, i will have a closer look
[13:52:55] <johnkpaul> Does anyone have any good resources for learning how to unit test jquery plugins?
[13:53:48] <jedimind> johnkpaul, ive used http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit in the past
[13:54:25] <johnkpaul> thanks jedimind, I mean resources for how to go about testing plugins in parituclar, qunit is a general javascript testing framework that happens to be used for jquery
[13:54:36] <jedimind> fair enough
[13:54:41] <johnkpaul> since almost all code in the traditional jquery plugin is private, it's pretty hard to test
[13:54:51] <johnkpaul> or rather, differnt patterns need to be used in order to test everything
[13:59:27] <Eruadan> jedimind, thanks a lot. That website is really plenty of ideas. :)
[14:00:36] <Eruadan> i lot of css3 in the mix also, good to put me up to date with css.
[14:01:16] <Mkop> johnkpaul: you don't necessarily need to test internals of the plugin. test based on what your expectations are as a user of the plugin
[14:01:34] <Eruadan> wicked http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/TypographyEffects/
[14:02:18] <jedimind> Eruadan, yeah there's lots of really cool test cases on there and concepts
[14:02:18] <johnkpaul> Mkop: yeah, I know, but sometimes I'd rather test some code behavior rather than checking to make sure that the DOM has changed or some event fired
[14:02:30] <johnkpaul> for example, if I am testing $(window).scroll()
[14:02:38] <johnkpaul> I don't want to be dependent on having a browser to scroll
[14:04:33] <johnkpaul> I'd rather just make sure thar $(window).scroll was called with a function that has some behavior
[14:22:05] <Jezzz> for someone who doesn't know what DOM is, when does jQuery(document).ready load?
[14:22:27] <Jezzz> <head>?  <body>?
[14:23:56] <ajpiano> Jezzz: someone who doesn't know what the DOM isn't shouldn't be using jQuery :)
[14:24:06] <ajpiano> Jezzz: but typically, it's at the end of the body tag
[14:24:07] <Jezzz> lol
[14:24:12] <Jezzz> k
[14:24:27] <Jezzz> i'm fighting with drupal (which i've never used) trying to get the flot library working
[14:24:39] <Jezzz> in simple html or asp, it's a cinch
[14:24:43] <Jezzz> drupal is proving frustrating
[14:24:52] <Faryshta> Jezzz, welcome to drupal
[14:25:20] <Jezzz> if it was at the end of the body tag, that would be perfect
[14:25:26] <Jezzz> but it doesn't seem to be working like that atm
[14:26:53] <ajpiano> Jezzz: it's fired when the dom is "ready" but before images have loaded
[14:27:00] <Jezzz> i need the js to run after a <div> is created
[14:27:07] <ajpiano> just put it after the div
[14:27:11] <Jezzz> so dom must be ready before then also
[14:27:34] <Jezzz> ajpiano:  that would be ideal, drupal apparently doesn't allow that
[14:27:36] <ajpiano> Jezzz: it would help if you had a live demo of your code failing, see ?demo
[14:27:37] <bot-t1> Jezzz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:29:51] <Jezzz> well, this is what i'm trying to reproduce: http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/basic.html
[14:30:24] <Jezzz> if you see the source, the script must come after the <div id="placeholder">
[14:30:45] <ajpiano> Jezzz: that's in a document ready block anyway
[14:30:56] <ajpiano> Jezzz: $(function() {}) is the same as $(document).ready(function(){})
[14:31:03] <Jezzz> drupal doesn't allow placing js anywhere, but I thought jquery.ready would work
[14:31:36] <Jezzz> well, that example isn't in drupal and I can't seem to order the code that way
[14:31:40] <Jezzz> or are you saying it shouldn't matter
[14:31:45] <Guest25256> haha. jquery
[14:31:51] <ajpiano> it shouldn't matter where you put it
[14:32:33] <Guest25256> Or should I say, jQuery?!
[14:32:33] <Jezzz> ajpiano:  can I pm you the actual page i'm working on?
[14:32:47] <ajpiano> if you really insist, i supose
[14:32:53] <Jezzz> i don't insist
[14:33:04] <Jezzz> it's just not working
[14:33:04] <ajpiano> why can't you post it in here :p
[14:33:06] <Jezzz> *shrug*
[14:33:17] <Guest25256> ajpiano: It contains military code.
[14:33:42] <ajpiano> Jezzz: send it over
[14:34:37] <nFFF> ajpiano whats your opinion on of PJAX?
[14:34:49] <Guest25256> WHAt is pjax
[14:34:57] <nFFF> ?pjax
[14:34:58] <bot-t1> nFFF, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:36:16] <nFFF> ITs liek ajax on steroids
[14:36:18] <ajpiano> nFFF: i don't have one
[14:36:31] <nFFF> ajpiano never heard of it/used it
[14:36:32] <nFFF> ?
[14:36:37] <nFFF> Or just couldnt care less
[14:36:52] <ajpiano> i've heard about it a few times, haevn't used it, and couldn't care less :p
[14:36:59] <nFFF> :>>>
[14:37:07] <konbiku> I'm trying to use the .on() function to keep some anchor tags active after an ajax load but im not sure if i'm doing it right. Can someone look at this snippet for me? https://gist.github.com/1953724
[14:37:23] <nFFF> Its used for ultra responsive websites, like ajax on steroids, can load in specific html without lots of http requests
[14:37:23] <Guest25256> ajpiano: Tell frred and wilma hi from me
[14:37:37] <ajpiano> Guest25256....
[14:37:43] <Jezzz> ajpiano:  thank you for your help
[14:38:06] <Jezzz> it seems I won't be able to resolve this without significant handholding or the elimination of drupal
[14:38:11] <Jezzz> so it's not looking good ;)
[14:38:16] <ajpiano> sorry Jezzz :(
[14:38:23] <Jezzz> np.  ta
[14:38:34] <Guest25256> ajpiano: It was funny :)
[14:38:47] <eddiemonge> Jezzz: i vote for the elimination of drupal
[14:39:10] <Jezzz> eddiemonge:  hear hear
[14:39:24] <eddiemonge> Guest25256: are you a troll?
[14:39:32] <Guest25256> No?
[14:39:35] <nFFF> konbiku does the click event fire?
[14:39:44] <ajpiano> konbiku: what do you mean by "keep it active"
[14:40:05] <ajpiano> konbiku: i suspect you are missing an event.preventDefault() in here as well
[14:40:30] <konbiku> nFFF & ajpiano... yes the click event fires on the first click, but after it does the .load() function the anchors tags no long work
[14:41:05] <nFFF> Ok the easiest way is to bind and check e.target, or at least thats how id do it :<
[14:41:09] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[14:41:10] <nFFF> bind to parent **
[14:41:46] <konbiku> ajpiano: yes i was just looking at that but feel a little confused still :(
[14:42:00] <konbiku> gill try reading it again..
[14:42:13] <ajpiano> konbiku: think of your links as tables in a room, and your ajax as a tablecloth
[14:42:17] <nFFF> konbiku, basically bind to a parent element that exists on dom load, and check to see if your current element exists
[14:42:39] <konbiku> hmm okay gonna try and see what happens
[14:42:43] <konbiku> thank you :) might be back
[14:42:47] <ajpiano> if you go into the room and put tablecloths on all the tables, and then i go destroy everything in the room and put new tables there, they don't magically have tablecloths on them.
[14:42:50] <ajpiano> it's like that.
[14:43:09] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: how does delegation fit into that analogy?
[14:43:24] <eddiemonge> waiters?
[14:43:37] <ajpiano> delegation is like the room has a sensor that everytime someone puts a table there, put a table cloth on it
[14:43:39] <ajpiano> or something
[14:43:40] <ajpiano> lol
[14:44:17] <chee> ajpiano: lololo
[14:44:19] <nFFF> you should kick ban yourself for such an anology
[14:44:24] <nFFF> imo
[14:44:42] <ajpiano> the tablecloth analogy is tried and true, man
[14:44:46] <chee> i think he should be paid for it
[14:44:51] <nFFF> he is
[14:44:56] <nFFF> he works for jquery
[14:45:01] <nFFF> hookers and cocaine every night baby
[14:45:19] <chee> ya but an especially large amount for the delegates are table sensors specifically
[14:46:41] <chee> invoice for 3 extra hookers

[15:20:15] <nFFF> eddiemonge do you even need the filter?
[15:20:28] <MistuhKurtz> a. Read/learn more to solve your problem
[15:20:38] <Guest25256> MistuhKurtz: Silly attitude
[15:20:39] <Guest25256> -_-
[15:20:42] <lmao25> I'll post the question here, maybe i'll get lucky. The issue is when you open the map icon and try to reopen it the google map does't load. You can see the link here: http://www.kingsport.com/site/ . I did not do the JS code FYI.
[15:20:45] <eddiemonge> nFFF: what filter?
[15:20:51] <MistuhKurtz> and b. Reach out to the community. The developer community is very warm and friendly and helpful
[15:20:59] <nFFF> in your code .filter(:contains
[15:21:14] <nFFF> whats different then putting that in the main selector
[15:21:16] <eddiemonge> nFFF: oh. no it doesnt
[15:21:25] <eddiemonge> i had something else in there first and left the filter
[15:21:36] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, I must infer from your answer that you are suggesting I use .prop in place of .attr, which isn't working as well. I'm not convinced I'm finding the correct selection using the $('select#easdescrip:contains("Civil Danger Warning")')
[15:21:49] <nFFF> constant jsfiddle open :P
[15:22:25] <Guest25256> MistuhKurtz: If people are doing work for little money
[15:22:30] <Guest25256> They clearly need the moneys
[15:23:26] <MistuhKurtz> But it can have the effect of undervaluing better quality professional service
[15:23:32] <MistuhKurtz> meh, </idealism>
[15:23:46] <MistuhKurtz> of course I acknowledge your point as well
[15:23:48] <eddiemonge> damn you nFFF now i have to do a perf test
[15:23:57] <nFFF> zanberdo, whats your beef with :contains()
[15:24:04] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: ok then ignore my clearly working example
[15:24:06] <nFFF> eddiemonge, on vs filter() :D
[15:24:07] <nFFF> ?
[15:24:16] <nFFF> Or contains vs indexOF
[15:24:45] <MistuhKurtz> I was just trying to tell him to try learning and being a part of the developer community. I think the open source/dev community is a really awesome thing and want other people to experience that as well
[15:24:53] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, my bad - I missed the jsfiddle link.
[15:25:36] <jaequery> urgent help, let's say i have var cost = '4,300.59'; ,  how do i convert this to float so i can perform arithmitic on it?
[15:25:47] <MistuhKurtz> How many other professionals can ask their 'competitors' for help and consistently receive it?
[15:26:33] <nFFF> ?parseFloat
[15:26:35] <bot-t1> nFFF, #6848 (style function fails to check for parseFloat(value) == NaN ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6848
[15:26:53] <nFFF> jaequery, use parseFloat
[15:27:09] <nFFF> or just check the parse family of type converters
[15:27:40] <jaequery> its got a comma on it
[15:27:58] <morice> ciao
[15:27:59] <jaequery> parsefloat works on 320.422 strings, but not on 3,422,444.23 strings
[15:28:05] <morice> !list
[15:28:13] <jaequery> or am i just seeing things?
[15:28:23] <nFFF> Yea conver your , into .
[15:28:49] <nFFF> replace() ..
[15:28:59] <nFFF> ?replace
[15:29:00] <bot-t1> nFFF, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[15:29:03] <nFFF> ?replace()
[15:29:04] <bot-t1> nFFF, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[15:29:11] <nFFF> ok only does jquery methods
[15:29:19] <nFFF> jaequery, theres a natie replace() in JS
[15:29:33] <eddiemonge> nFFF: this was my point http://jsperf.com/filter-vs-contains
[15:29:51] <jaequery> yeah i know, i just thought there would be a cleaner way than parseFloat(string.replace(',',''))
[15:30:10] <jaequery> parsefloat should really cover the ones w/ strings built-in by default
[15:30:17] <jaequery> w/ commas*
[15:30:29] <nFFF> eddiemonge yea anyhing but using the main selectors is usually faster
[15:31:09] <eddiemonge> ?eval var cost = '4,300.59'; parseFloat(cost);
[15:31:11] <bot-t1> eddiemonge: 4
[15:31:20] <eddiemonge> ?eval var cost = '4,300.59'; parseInt(cost);
[15:31:21] <bot-t1> eddiemonge: 4
[15:31:25] <jaequery> see :)
[15:31:34] <eddiemonge> ?eval var cost = '4,300.59'; parseFloat(cost.replace(',',''));
[15:31:34] <nFFF> jaequery, whats wrong with replace?
[15:31:35] <bot-t1> eddiemonge: 4300.59
[15:31:55] <nFFF> eddiemonge, the real jsperf is whats faster .filter and .text or indexOf :>
[15:32:29] <nFFF> jaequery, it will take nanoseconds to replace the ',' unless the sequence is massive
[15:32:44] <jaequery> its not the speed, im just talking about in terms of elegance
[15:33:04] <nFFF> :>
[15:33:11] <nFFF> you masterbate over your code?? :>
[15:33:33] <Tumeski> Ummmm I noticed Live() has been changed (obsolete)
[15:33:58] <jaequery> nfff: if its converting string to float, it might as well cover strings with commas , just sayin
[15:34:01] <eddiemonge> deprecated is the correct term
[15:34:04] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, your example works fine (thank you). However, it does not distinguish between multiple selectors with the same matching options. I need to target a specific select by id. I'm still tripped up by how to specify the selector
[15:34:05] <KwikkSilva> hi guys
[15:34:06] <MistuhKurtz> parseFloat(cost.replace(',', ''); looks elegant enough to me
[15:34:38] <KwikkSilva> Can someone help me with my little learning app... the add button keeps flipping back up on the iPad.... fine in Safari
[15:34:40] <KwikkSilva> http://bit.ly/yAnEhE
[15:34:43] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: if you have an id then everything becomes extremely easy. i was satisfying your requirements
[15:34:54] <KwikkSilva> code here - http://jsfiddle.net/KCQ4Z/334/
[15:35:02] <Tumeski> I use some addClass and since its running in Ajax do I just use on() like I would with Live()?
[15:35:11] <MistuhKurtz> no
[15:35:18] <MistuhKurtz> you can, but you have to write it a certain way
[15:35:35] <MistuhKurtz> and it's not recommended unless absolutely necessary
[15:35:39] <eddiemonge> Tumeski: did you read the documentation for .on()?
[15:35:51] <Tumeski> I am looking at it at the moment
[15:36:02] <jaequery> does the same thing in PHP too, O_o
[15:36:02] <Tumeski> Well im looking at .live, gotta check .on out
[15:36:11] <MistuhKurtz> $('a.dynamicClass').on('hover', document, function(){ });
[15:36:14] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, the select object has an id (in the example it should have been 'easdescrip'). The requirements was simply to set the select object id'easdescript' with the appropriate option based on a partial match of the options available for that select id (I'm sure I wasn't that specific at the outset, my bad).
[15:36:21] <MistuhKurtz> is the same as using live(), but it's inefficient
[15:36:24] <eddiemonge> ?on delegation @ Tumeski
[15:36:25] <bot-t1> Tumeski, The new .on() method supports delegated events as well. Read up on it at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:36:46] <Tumeski> Okay thanks all, I'll read first and ask if need more support
[15:36:52] <MistuhKurtz> you should use a parent element that's as close as possible
[15:36:54] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: how is that not answered by my example?
[15:37:02] <jaequery> i think, they should deprecate, .bind() too
[15:37:07] <MistuhKurtz> but read the documentation
[15:37:14] <jaequery> they are like same thing
[15:37:18] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: thats actually an incorrect example. you have it backwards
[15:37:24] <MistuhKurtz> whoops sorry
[15:37:29] <Tumeski> document first :D
[15:37:32] <MistuhKurtz> haven't written it in a while
[15:37:32] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[15:37:41] <Tumeski> but I got the idea, thanks
[15:37:54] <MistuhKurtz> it's better if you do something like
[15:38:09] <MistuhKurtz> $('.dynamic').on('#wrapper', 'hover', function(){});
[15:38:12] <eddiemonge> jaequery: bind internally calls on. bind wont be deprecated anytime soon because it was the way to handle events for all of jQuery's life up until 1.7
[15:38:22] <MistuhKurtz> yeah
[15:38:27] <eddiemonge> MistuhKurtz: still backwards
[15:38:34] <MistuhKurtz> wat
[15:38:38] <MistuhKurtz> last time i wrote 'hover' first
[15:38:41] <jaequery> eddiemonge: thought it was the other way around,  where on() calls bind()
[15:38:43] <MistuhKurtz> OH
[15:38:44] <MistuhKurtz> whoops
[15:38:45] <MistuhKurtz> hahahaha
[15:38:50] <eddiemonge> $("parentSelector").on("event", "childSelector", callback)
[15:39:00] <jaequery> does that mean, on() was there from way back in the beginning?
[15:39:08] * MistuhKurtz facepalms his facepalm
[15:39:11] <MistuhKurtz> lol, thanks.
[15:39:18] <eddiemonge> jaequery: events were pretty much completely rewritten for 1.7
[15:39:30] <MistuhKurtz> no on() is new, before it there was delegate(), then live(), and then bind()
[15:39:54] <MistuhKurtz> but bind() is pretty close to native javascript for attaching event handlers, amirite?
[15:40:27] <eddiemonge> $("parentSelector").on("event", "childSelector", callback)  =  jQuery($), find an element that matches  ("parentSelector") and on this event: "event", find a child selector that matches this: "childSelector" and do this: callback
[15:40:36] <MistuhKurtz> i dont' think it would be deprecated. $('a').on('hover', function(){ }); calls bind() doesn't it?
[15:41:15] <zanberdo> nm, I figured out the necessary syntax to complete your example. Here is mine: http://jsfiddle.net/zanberdo/aqZFP/
[15:41:41] <eddiemonge> bind: function( types, data, fn ) {
[15:41:41] <eddiemonge> 		return this.on( types, null, data, fn );
[15:41:45] <eddiemonge> direct from the source
[15:44:19] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: this would be faster: http://jsfiddle.net/aqZFP/1/
[15:44:42] <eddiemonge> nFFF: look, i used indexOf lol
[15:46:09] <jaequery> the parentselector for on, can it be used like this too? $("div").on(.....
[15:46:33] <jaequery> because sometimes, my triggers aren't on the same parent
[15:46:40] <jaequery> they could be all over the place
[15:47:16] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, actually, that's close to the route I was going to go (I was planning to use the .each to roll through all the options and find the match, then set the selector) but I figured there had to be a more elegant solution. However, I do not know what sort of overhead find/filter would entail vs. the method you have originally proposed.
[15:47:23] <erichynds> jaequery: yeah. you can bind to the document too if you want
[15:47:53] <eddiemonge> erichynds: shh. dont say that. then thats all they will every bind to
[15:48:24] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: what i just gave you is probably one of the fastest ways
[15:48:46] <erichynds> sometimes it's very useful to delegate from the document
[15:48:47] <jaequery> what if i had two of these:  <div class='dad'>... </div>  <div class='dad'>... </div>   and i had $('.dad').on('....   ,  will that work too even though it has two dads as parents?
[15:49:06] <eddiemonge> but also the slowest
[15:49:27] <acidjazz> ur moms the fastest way
[15:49:50] <erichynds> zing
[15:49:58] <eddiemonge> i feel like that was missing the punchline
[15:50:13] <jaequery> last time i heard a ur mom comeback was like 10 years ago
[15:51:12] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, thank you for providing me with some options. I will make good use of them. I also like jsfiddle (this is the first I've seen this site). It will go a long way toward resolving these types of issues outside my main project.
[15:51:20] <jaequery> so back to the question, what if i had two of these:  <div class='dad'>... </div>  <div class='dad'>... </div>   and i had $('.dad').on('....   ,  will that work too even though it has two dads as parents?
[15:51:30] <eddiemonge> yes
[15:51:35] <eddiemonge> its modern
[15:51:39] <Tumeski> Okay I can't get my mind around this simple thing now. If I have $(this).toggleClass("selected"); like so giving class selected for that element. Then I launch on a clik event on a and I go for .each on parent of the element that has selected class now and I want to if(hasClass("selected")) how do I go making this?
[15:51:42] <eddiemonge> it doesnt discriminate
[15:51:59] <erichynds> jaequery: yes
[15:52:13] <eddiemonge> Tumeski: say wha?
[15:52:17] <Tumeski> .each(function(index) { if(index.hasClass("selected")) { like so
[15:52:21] <jaequery> i guess these days, its quite common to have two dads as parent
[15:52:31] <jaequery> so it should work on jquery too i suppose
[15:52:34] <eddiemonge> Tumeski: if ( $(this).hasClass
[15:52:58] <Tumeski> Yeah this, but anyway it's not picking up?
[15:53:05] <erichynds> jaequery: :D
[15:53:13] <teratorn> anyone have a recommendation for submitting a form with ajax as JSON data?
[15:53:38] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ teratorn
[15:53:39] <bot-t1> teratorn, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:53:43] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Tumeski
[15:53:44] <bot-t1> Tumeski, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:53:59] <eddiemonge> teratorn: sorry, not for you.  you need preventDefault and .post()
[15:53:59] <teratorn> huh?
[15:54:04] <teratorn> ok :)
[15:54:27] <teratorn> eddiemonge: I'll check in to it
[15:54:31] <eddiemonge> teratorn: you dont submit it as JSON. you receive the response back as JSON
[15:55:42] <jaequery> $.post(url, json, function(.......
[15:57:35] <Tumeski> http://jsfiddle.net/tHvsA/ like so for the problem
[15:57:54] <teratorn> eddiemonge: I can live with that, but I kinda just wanted to submit as JSON too
[15:58:39] <teratorn> jaequery: the trick is converting a form to JSON
[15:59:46] <erichynds> do you really want json, or just an encoded representation of your form inputs to pass along to the server?
[16:00:00] <ajpiano> teratorn: get this tiny plugin and JSON2.js
[16:00:04] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#serializeobject
[16:00:33] <ajpiano> https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[16:00:34] <jaequery> or just run it by this method http://paste2.org/p/1922062
[16:00:56] <ajpiano> jaequery: that's what the plugin does :)
[16:01:19] <eddiemonge> teratorn: why do you want to submit it as json?
[16:01:32] <teratorn> erichynds: I figured json would be the easiest encoded rep of my form's inputs
[16:01:39] <jaequery> i like submitting data as json, personally
[16:01:39] <tw2113> ut oh.... an @
[16:01:46] <ajpiano> teratorn: and if you get those things, you can do JSON.stringify( $("#someform").serializeObject() );
[16:01:47] <eddiemonge> ?preventDefault @ Tumeski
[16:01:48] <bot-t1> Tumeski, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[16:01:48] <jaequery> so i can manipulate data
[16:02:01] <ajpiano> teratorn: as to why you want to do it, you should know that also :)
[16:02:13] <teratorn> because awesome
[16:02:16] <jaequery> i wonder if he wants to submit as json string or json object
[16:02:26] <eddiemonge> or as json at all
[16:02:36] <teratorn> jaequery: well clearly it has to be flattened to a string
[16:02:47] <erichynds> jaequery: $(form).serialize() would be the easiest
[16:02:51] <ajpiano> jaequery: http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
[16:02:58] <Guest25256> Why is it windows?
[16:03:04] <jaequery> $.post(url, json/obj, function(.......
[16:03:12] <jaequery> it doesnt 'have' to be a string
[16:03:26] <ajpiano> jaequery: um, yeah it does.
[16:03:38] <ajpiano> if you pass an *object* it gets serialised as URL params
[16:03:42] <ajpiano> same as .serialize()
[16:04:05] <ajpiano> jaequery: there's no such thing as a json object, JSON is a string representation of an object. by definition, it is a string.
[16:04:23] <ajpiano> so if teratorn indeed wants to submit json, which is not an unreasonable thing to do, now he knows how
[16:04:32] <boaz> did event hooks ever get added?
[16:04:36] <teratorn> ajpiano: thanks
[16:04:38] <boaz> I should know this but I dont.
[16:04:44] <ajpiano> boaz: yes
[16:04:57] <jaequery> well var bla = "{'bla':'blabla'}"; is what i consider as json string ..  and bla = {bla: 'blabla'}; as json obj
[16:05:13] <jaequery> because i know some people who actually POST as json string
[16:05:14] <ajpiano> jaequery: well you should get your terminology right, because what you consider it is wrong :|
[16:05:28] <ajpiano> it's an object literal, not a "json object"
[16:06:00] <boaz> aha http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ nvm
[16:07:47] <Tumeski> eddiemonge what do you mean by that?
[16:08:23] <boaz> uh, ajpiano, wasn't jQuery.event.props.push("myRandomProp"); deprecated?
[16:08:33] <boaz> jvdev is asking ajpiano
[16:09:02] <ajpiano> boaz: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/s9EXK/
[16:09:06] <boaz> I thought it was being replaced by event hooks, but the docs stil doc it http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[16:09:19] <eddiemonge> Tumeski: you jerk: http://jsfiddle.net/tHvsA/2/  you had a space in your main id and i didnt see it and was getting angry because shit wasnt working
[16:09:29] <boaz> yah, jvdev, use jQuery.event.propHooks.drop
[16:09:39] <jvdev> awesome
[16:09:44] <boaz> the thing ajpiano, jvdev, use that.
[16:09:46] <ajpiano> boaz: i think it's still there, but it may be outdated
[16:09:53] <boaz> yah wicked
[16:10:06] <jvdev> awesome thanks boaz, ajpiano
[16:10:40] <eddiemonge> Tumeski: http://jsfiddle.net/tHvsA/3/
[16:10:43] <Tumeski> haha, sorry I updated it tough it was my mistake. That line of yours looks much better too didn't even think using find bla
[16:11:42] <eddiemonge> teratorn: so what are you submitting the data to?
[16:11:54] <teratorn> eddiemonge: my devious web-app
[16:12:07] <eddiemonge> teratorn: does it expect is as normal POST data?
[16:12:41] <teratorn> eddiemonge: nah, I have full control over it
[16:13:20] <teratorn> twisted-based web server
[16:13:29] <Tumeski> eddiemonge, works great. Thank you for your help
[16:16:21] <Mage_Dude> If I attach an event handler through .on() to a wrapper div #properties so that a button with class 'edit' triggers a response, I should be able to later add a new button with class 'edit' and it should fire the event as well yes?
[16:18:45] <erichynds> Mage_Dude: yeah.
[16:18:47] <eddiemonge> Mage_Dude: depending on your code and DOM yes
[16:19:19] <Mage_Dude> Ok, then I'm doing something wrong.
[16:21:00] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Mage_Dude
[16:21:00] <bot-t1> Mage_Dude, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:22:44] <Mage_Dude> Indeed, just wanted to make sure I wasn't reading the docs wrong. I thought it should work. I'm sure it will work in a stripped down jsfiddle, but it rarely seems to work in practice.
[16:34:16] <jvdev> boaz, ajpiano propHooks is now fixHooks http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10438
[16:35:12] <crankharder> go here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/  make your browser as narrow (horizontally) as possible.  open console and do this: $( "#dialog" ).dialog({width: 500, position: [0,0]});  -- notice that the dialog is forced off the left side of the screen.  why? shouldn't it go off the right side?
[16:47:47] <JE_> Hi!
[16:48:13] <coldhead> hi JE_
[16:48:42] <JE_> I have a question about jquery tabs, are the scripts automatically adding the classes to all elements inside the main tab div?
[16:49:50] <JE_> Because I keep changing the classes in my source code, and they just keep rendering the same way, with the same classes as before
[16:50:19] <JE_> If I comment out the scripts in the head of the file, the classes I specified are actually passed
[16:53:00] <shesek> it should add new classes, not remove the ones you added
[16:54:14] <JE_> I wish to only have the script add the classes necessary for hover and active tabs
[16:54:40] <JE_> The idea is to have a much minimalist look than the default themes
[16:54:52] <JE_> But I guess I should better edit the css...
[16:55:30] <JE_> I just wanted to have my elements with not so much classes (many are usingn 4 or 5, when 1 would do)
[16:56:08] <shesek> if you aren't using most of the CSS provided by jQuery-UI, just don't use it
[16:56:23] <shesek> take out the parts you do want and add to your CSS
[16:56:47] <shesek> you can also create your own jQuery UI theme using the web interface
[16:56:51] <kkk_> fadsfj
[16:57:13] <shesek> or, if you're using the full CSS in some places, you can create a CSS file that only applies to elements within a specific selector
[16:57:21] <coldhead> is this you, shesek ? http://www.shesek.info/category/javascript
[16:57:42] <JE_> Thats what I'm doing. For example, I have this in my source <div class="ui-tabs" id="tabs">
[16:57:45] <shesek> yes, why?
[16:57:53] <coldhead> nice writing!
[16:57:59] <coldhead> i'll read these, good work
[16:58:01] <acidjazz> ur moms
[16:58:10] <JE_> And I get this in the actual page <div id="tabs" class="ui-tabs ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all">
[16:58:40] <shesek> coldhead, cool, thanks :-)
[16:58:48] <acidjazz> why coffeescript though shesk
[16:59:05] <shesek> because JavaScript is so 2011 :P
[16:59:06] <acidjazz> why not create a scripting anguage for your blog that converts it into coffeescript
[16:59:22] <acidjazz> just write it fast enough before its 2012 and you have to write another
[16:59:24] <shesek> j/k. I find CoffeeScript a much more elegant language
[16:59:46] <acidjazz> but your blog now stipulates people from knowing it
[16:59:52] <shesek> much quicker to write, much more readable and expresses the intents of the programmer much better
[16:59:54] <acidjazz> i was super into the post until i hit that then i closed the window
[17:00:11] <shesek> I do mostly provide a JavaScript version too
[17:00:14] <acidjazz> for people that know it..
[17:01:19] <shesek> I don't really make any effort to get people to come there, nor I have any interest in people reading it
[17:01:21] <acidjazz> im sorry shesek i created a new irc client before you said that last phrase that only decodes hyper-acronym-irctalk so we can talk more elegantally about this
[17:01:31] <acidjazz> piisucttmbayb
[17:01:56] <shesek> so... its mostly for my taking notes and for people I work with
[17:02:18] <shesek> I don't care too much about satisfying other people :-)
[17:03:33] <boaz> huh?
[17:04:31] <coldhead> let's all just move on
[17:24:49] <someprimetime> can i create an xhr object and still use it within ajax()?
[17:24:59] <someprimetime> so that i can create the request body
[17:25:31] <eddiemonge> request body?
[17:25:47] <someprimetime> payload request body
[17:26:06] <someprimetime> i'm trying to manipulate a form
[17:26:27] <someprimetime> but for some reason when i try to set the Content-Disposition and Content-Type, it's not formatted properly
[17:26:44] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/nCoai.png
[17:27:18] <someprimetime> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9523041/ajax-request-payload-body-not-formatted-properly
[17:30:04] <eddiemonge> how are you creating it?
[17:32:04] <xx> xxxss
[17:44:43] <diverdude> Hey, im using the jQuery UI MultiSelect Widget. How do i specify font and font size?
[17:45:27] <shesek> in the same way you do for every other element
[17:49:23] <diverdude> shesek: no thats not really working
[17:49:57] <eddiemonge> diverdude: then you arent doing it right. its css
[17:50:01] <diverdude> shesek: $("#LookupBusiness").css("font-weight","normal"); still shows a fat font
[17:50:44] <diverdude> its still bold
[17:50:56] <shesek> diverdude, check out the DOM and see which element actually contains the text
[17:51:05] <shesek> (firebug / developer tools)
[17:52:41] <Guest25256> shesek: If you use windows
[17:53:10] <shesek> .. what?
[17:54:08] <eddiemonge> i feel like Guest25256 is just asking for a boot
[17:54:44] <diverdude> there must be an easier way
[17:54:51] <diverdude> instead of having to hack it
[17:55:22] <eddiemonge> diverdude: who said anything about hacking it? find out which element is specifically bold and make it not so
[17:55:38] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: i'm out for the night but yea he's been just weirdly trolling or... something all day
[17:55:40] <ajpiano> so ya
[17:56:00] <eddiemonge> yea
[17:56:09] <eddiemonge> like not offensive trolling
[17:56:13] <eddiemonge> but plain weird
[18:00:46] <diverdude> eddiemonge: if its an element which is bold because it implements some class and there are 1000 classes its kinda hard to find
[18:01:17] <Gaddel> if i want to select all of a class that does not have a certain attribute, can i do something like $(".cls[!attr]") ?
[18:03:22] <coldhead> Gaddel: http://jsfiddle.net/WrJUN/
[18:04:00] <diverdude> im using this plugin: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[18:04:08] <Gaddel> thanks
[18:04:18] <d4rklit3> hi
[18:04:20] <d4rklit3> if i have a string
[18:04:22] <d4rklit3> thats html
[18:05:07] <d4rklit3> what do i need to do to it to actually make it show up as html   (ie. $("#container").html(myHtmlString);
[18:05:18] <coldhead> just what you have there should work
[18:05:23] <coldhead> it's meant to be easy
[18:05:27] <eddiemonge> diverdude: thats why you use chrome dev tools/firebug to see which one is making it bold. if you use .css() it will overwrite all of the classes
[18:06:00] <Eruadan> Is there any web site with  interactive tutorials ? I quite like that method to learn
[18:06:06] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: that
[18:06:14] <KwikkSilva> Can someone help me with my little learning app... the add button keeps flipping back up on the iPad.... fine in Safari

[18:06:26] <d4rklit3> hmm
[18:06:29] <d4rklit3> that no working
[18:06:31] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: follow the getting started guide
[18:06:37] <d4rklit3> im feeding the data from my Razer model in mvc3
[18:06:47] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: then theres something wrong with your string
[18:06:53] <d4rklit3> yeah prob
[18:07:22] <coldhead> try restarting your browser
[18:07:51] <Eruadan> eddiemonge, yes, that is in my schedule. I was just looking for extra stuff, such as codeacademy is for js.
[18:08:03] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge probably
[18:10:12] <eddiemonge> Eruadan: start there
[18:13:36] <d4rklit3> oo you double quotes
[18:13:41] <d4rklit3> slippery little guys
[18:13:57] <diverdude> eddiemonge: i located the elements but it says nothing about a bold style event though they are shown as bold
[18:14:45] <coldhead> bold style event?
[18:14:49] <shesek> "bold style event"?
[18:14:57] <shesek> blah. beat me to it
[18:15:09] <diverdude> what is that?
[18:15:11] <coldhead> you punctuated it better
[18:15:52] <donCams> "bold style event"?!...
[18:16:03] <shesek> diverdude, you're asking us? you wrote it o_O
[18:16:30] <diverdude> haha
[18:16:37] <diverdude> sorry
[18:16:41] <diverdude> that was a typo
[18:17:06] <diverdude> it should be bold style font
[18:18:24] <shesek> it should be there somewhere
[18:18:43] <shesek> but in any case, just try changing your selector to find the those elements
[18:19:07] <shesek> or better yet, just add `selector {font-weight: normal;}` to your CSS instead of doing that with JavaScript
[18:19:27] <shesek> (you might need !important there, but try without it first and see if it works)
[18:19:34] <diverdude> shesek: yeah, but i have no idea what the selector is
[18:20:57] <shesek> if you see the elements on firebug/developer tools, it shouldn't be hard to write a selector
[18:21:08] <shesek> if you still don't know, you should probably read about writing selectors
[18:21:16] <shesek> !g css selectors
[18:21:18] <shesek> !g css selectors mdn
[18:21:22] <shesek> !google css selectors mdn
[18:21:25] <coldhead> you should be able to "read" the selector off the path shown in your debugger

[18:23:35] <diverdude> shesek: well forexample this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1645757212   this is the html and classes around the element of interest
[18:23:53] <diverdude> shesek: this is the actual text: "Select an option"
[18:23:56] <coldhead> lol
[18:24:04] <diverdude> shesek: but none of those classes has anything in bold
[18:24:21] <diverdude> shesek: when i look in the css
[18:24:29] <eddiemonge> diverdude: ok right click select an option and select inspect element
[18:24:48] <shesek> don't look in the CSS, look in [firebug/developer tools]'s applied styles
[18:25:06] <shesek> there's a list on the right with all the styles applied on the element, and where they come from
[18:25:27] <eddiemonge> div.ui-widget-header ul.ui-helper-reset li { font-weight: normal; }
[18:25:29] <eddiemonge> if it was me
[18:25:41] <diverdude> eddiemonge: i only see inspect in DOM tab. is that the one?
[18:26:05] <eddiemonge> diverdude: what browser are you using?
[18:26:14] <diverdude> firefox
[18:27:04] <diverdude> ahhh its there in the right side ok..i see it
[18:27:05] <eddiemonge> right click, do you see Inspect Element? click that
[18:27:51] <diverdude> ahaaa Inherited fromdiv.ui-widget-header
[18:27:57] <diverdude> theres something bold there
[18:28:14] <eddiemonge> ....like i said
[18:28:27] <diverdude> yes
[18:28:33] <diverdude> like you said
[18:29:28] <diverdude> hmm but i guess if i change boldness for this class it will apply to all jqueryui classes?
[18:31:01] <eddiemonge> diverdude: yes it will.
[18:31:22] <m0> Hello, is there a way to supress the XHR error logs? I don't want the user to get a lot of error logs in their console. The app uses those errors.
[18:31:46] <diverdude> eddiemonge: but im not really interested in that since i use jquery ui for other things also which will then also get affected i guess :/
[18:32:29] <eddiemonge> diverdude: so then target it with an id or something
[18:32:41] <eddiemonge> diverdude: you should really read that css selector guide
[18:32:55] <diverdude> eddiemonge: there is no id
[18:33:08] <diverdude> and starting to hacking it is kinda bad
[18:33:17] <diverdude> beginning to alter the src code
[18:33:29] <diverdude> its not to good
[18:33:37] <someprimetime> oh while we're on the topic of xhr.. http://jsfiddle.net/NcAVc/ anyone know how i can preserve my `i` variable? wrapped it in a closure, but no luck :|
[18:33:38] <diverdude> as i said in the beginning
[18:35:05] <eddiemonge> diverdude: how are you creating the multiselect then?
[18:35:23] <eddiemonge> m0: dont console.log things then
[18:35:56] <coldhead> someprimetime: just do var j = i; inside the closure
[18:35:59] <coldhead> and use j
[18:36:00] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: thats not exactly what closures are for. preserve it for what?
[18:36:01] <diverdude> eddiemonge: like this : $("#weight_kg_from").multiselect({create: function(){ $(this).next().width(boxwidth); },multiple: false,header: "Select an option",noneSelectedText: "Select an Option",selectedList: 1});
[18:36:18] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: preserve it so i can read each one object member
[18:36:36] <eddiemonge> ok then why cant you do #weight_kg_from div.ui-widget-header ul.ui-helper-reset li { font-weight: normal; }
[18:37:15] <Guest97452> Hello guys. So I'm using this script http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery.panorama/, how can I run scripts when the image is in a particular position? I guess it should be by getting the margin-left value, but how to get that recursively during the animation? Thanks.
[18:37:19] <defendguin> does jquery have a built in method for dealing with html 5 dataset attributes or do i have to do .attr('data-name')?
[18:37:22] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: you do some of the weirdest (re: hardest approach) things

[18:37:56] <eddiemonge> its like you didnt even look at the docs ;)
[18:38:05] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: why are you using that?

[18:38:38] <someprimetime> and to let the user remove what they selected before they upload
[18:39:40] <nachitogil> Hello guys. So I'm using this script http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery.panorama/, how can I run scripts when the image is in a particular position? I guess it should be by getting the margin-left value, but how to get that recursively during the animation? Thanks.
[18:40:31] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: for drag and drop what?

[18:40:37] <bot-t1> nachitogil, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/

[18:41:14] * coldhead hugs bot-t1 
[18:41:15] * bot-t1 hugs coldhead back
[18:41:45] <nachitogil> coldhead: that won't work
[18:41:57] <coldhead> sorry nachitogil, it's my first day using jquery
[18:42:04] <nachitogil> ah, thanks
[18:42:48] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: im missing something with filereader and drag and drop and your example
[18:43:01] <eddiemonge> ?coldhead
[18:43:01] <caniuse> eddiemonge: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[18:43:02] <bot-t1> coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[18:43:09] <eddiemonge> double action
[18:43:38] <coldhead> all the bots are against me
[18:44:02] <someprimetime> drag and drop has nothing to do with it.. but that's also what i'm using filereader for.. the main reason for using it, is to read in all the image files' binary data so i can create a "pseudo hash" which is placed as a hidden input field on the page. this is to prevent people from selecting multiple files, removing a few and then trying to add more
[18:44:36] <someprimetime> HTML5 will allow the multiple uploads in an input file field, but it won't allow you to remove those selected before upload
[18:44:40] <someprimetime> so i had to make a workaround
[18:46:47] <diverdude> eddiemonge: hmm ok i managed
[18:46:53] <diverdude> eddiemonge: this did it: $(".ui-state-default, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-default, .ui-widget-header .ui-state-default").css("font-weight","normal").css("font-size","6px")
[18:47:02] <someprimetime> i
[18:47:05] <someprimetime> woops sorry
[18:47:33] <diverdude> eddiemonge: just not a very nice solution sice this will affect all controls using jquery ui which is not really my desire :(
[18:47:56] <eddiemonge> diverdude: why do you consistently ignore my solutions? makes me not want to help you anymore
[18:48:21] <imanc> hey folks - has anyone had a $.post response function not trigger in IE7 o 8 without any errors ?
[18:49:01] <diverdude> eddiemonge: i tried the o #weight_kg_from div.ui-widget-header ul.ui-helper-reset li { font-weight: normal; } as you proposed and it didnt work
[18:49:50] <eddiemonge> diverdude: what didnt work about it?
[18:50:03] <diverdude> eddiemonge: the font was not changed
[18:50:12] <eddiemonge> diverdude: what did the inspector say?
[18:50:29] <eddiemonge> imanc: was it the first time you called it?
[18:51:05] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: have you seen http://robertnyman.com/2010/12/16/utilizing-the-html5-file-api-to-choose-upload-preview-and-see-progress-for-multiple-files/#comment-682330
[18:51:54] <nachitogil> so, how can I get the value recursively during an animation
[18:52:49] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: yeah i implemented drag drop as well, but i give the user a list of the files they drop onto the page
[18:52:58] <SinnerNyx> How would I make my own animation? If I don't want to use animate. I just need a function to be called regularly to update the values, and then dequeue the animation and proceed to the next animation in the queue
[18:53:07] <imanc> eddiemonge: it's just dead. I'm using jquery-tmpl, loading in data and then creating a template.  It works fine in FF ahd chrome but in IE the call back function to post does not ire at all . I put an alert() at the top of it, and I'm not seeing anything in IE. But that alert fires OK in FF and chrome.
[18:53:10] <someprimetime> that way they can remove them if they choose the wrong file (since it works for both clicking a select button as well)
[18:53:25] <diverdude> eddiemonge: nothing else than usually
[18:56:19] <eddiemonge> imanc: did you lint your code?
[18:56:35] <eddiemonge> diverdude: you arent seeing the style you applied?
[18:57:24] <imanc> eddiemonge: linting now. thanks
[19:01:11] <nachitogil> again, how can I get values of an object during an animation?
[19:01:58] <jmoney> que?
[19:02:18] <nachitogil> que de que
[19:02:56] <jmoney> if your animation function is defined in a scope where you can refer to that object, you can just refer to that object
[19:03:16] <eddiemonge> nachitogil: did you read the docs/source for that plugin to see if has callback methods?
[19:03:34] <nachitogil> eddiemonge: yes, there's no callback methods :(
[19:03:45] <nachitogil> eddiemonge: I was trying to write that by my own, but I'm not that good
[19:08:41] <eddiemonge> that is not a good plugin
[19:08:56] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: sorrry, was looking for a way to remove files from a multiple list but cant find any
[19:09:27] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: no worries
[19:09:31] <someprimetime> i already implemented it
[19:10:41] <someprimetime> i basically just mimicked java's hash function and then i do a substr of like the last 30 characters of the file's binary data and then add that in as a hidden input field on the page… then i added that hash to the 'X' icon… when they click the X icon, grab the hash which correlates to the cloned filelist object member that they are trying to remove and remove that hidden input field on the page
[19:10:58] <someprimetime> works pretty well :)
[19:12:48] <eddiemonge> nachitogil: use $(".panorama-container") margin-left to see where it is
[19:13:15] <nachitogil> eddiemonge: thanks, I tried that, but it will call that just when it starts
[19:13:22] <nachitogil> eddiemonge: I need to know that value all the time during animation
[19:13:34] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: but then how are the files actually sent? you are sending them all then ignoring them based on the hidden inputs?
[19:13:36] <nachitogil> eddiemonge: I guess by hacking the plugin using the 'step' thing will work
[19:14:40] <someprimetime> the files are sent by looping through the cloned object and creating an xhr object for each of them
[19:14:45] <someprimetime> they just post to my controller
[19:15:20] <someprimetime> basically each time the user wants to remove one of the selected files, i remove that index (member) and all it's properties from the object
[19:15:39] <someprimetime> so you have a filelist clone object with like 3 members and they click the equivalent of the 1st one.. i just remove that from the object
[19:15:44] <someprimetime> they then click upload.. ok send what's in the object
[19:15:56] <someprimetime> but you have to read the binary data through it though before doing so
[19:16:14] <eddiemonge> ok thats the part i wasnt seeing
[19:16:29] <eddiemonge> so you are reading the file into the object using filereader?
[19:28:41] <nachitogil> Any idea how can I get the position while animation on this plugin? http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery.panorama/
[19:35:33] <m0> Hello, is there a way to supress the XHR error logs? I don't want the user to get a lot of error logs in their console. The app uses those errors. I am not console.logging any of them, they are coming from jQuery (I was looking at jquery source and it doesn't seem to spit anything out, is that a normal Chrome behavoir?)
[19:45:48] <ngharo> m0: you should be fixing errors rather than trying to suppress them
[19:46:40] <engineglue1> hello
[19:47:22] <engineglue1> Can I create a <form> element? I know I can append <input> to a form element but can I create the <form> and </form> elements?
[19:49:06] <shesek> engineglue1, $('<form>') or $(document.createElement('form'))
[19:49:18] <engineglue1> shesek: you make it sound so easy!
[19:49:19] <shesek> or just document.createElement('form') if you want a plain DOM element
[19:49:19] <engineglue1> :)
[19:49:30] <engineglue1> what's a DOM?
[19:49:46] <snover> ?101 @ engineglue1
[19:49:47] <bot-t1> engineglue1, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[19:50:05] <engineglue1> nah, I know how to do it
[19:50:22] <engineglue1> just don't know what DOM means.
[19:50:32] <shesek> ?dom
[19:50:33] <bot-t1> shesek, DOM Insertion, Outside - These methods allow us to insert new content outside an existing element. http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-outside/
[19:50:51] <engineglue1> oh ok
[19:51:04] <shesek> no, its not what I thought he'll say
[19:51:06] <shesek> bad bot
[19:51:13] <engineglue1> dom?
[19:51:54] <snover> not sure if troll…
[19:52:17] <shesek> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model
[19:52:38] <snover> “don’t know what DOM means” is like trying to write complex math equations without knowing what “plus symbol” means
[19:52:56] <shesek> snover, actually its quite common those days
[19:53:20] <shesek> jQuery hides all the "boring details", so people write web application without really knowing how anything works
[19:53:49] <alexmcpherson> But thank god you don't have to use native methods on a daily basis though, amiright?
[19:53:53] <engineglue1> snover: however one can add numbers without knowing what the + symbol means.
[19:54:44] <shesek> alexmcpherson, I do find jQuery much more convenient and hardly ever use the native DOM functions directly
[19:54:59] <shesek> but I do think its very important to know that stuff if you're going to do web development
[19:55:14] <engineglue1> snover: I've seen myself out-perform quite a few developers yet I taught myself everything I know so I don't know what anything is called.
[19:55:35] <shesek> you never even heard the term "DOM"?
[19:55:48] <engineglue1> shesek: yep, never cared.
[19:55:56] <snover> I’m sure your code is amazing.
[19:56:07] <engineglue1> shesek: I tend to only learn what I need to know when I need to know it.
[19:56:16] <engineglue1> snover: nice crack.
[19:56:26] <engineglue1> snover: would you like to critique me?
[19:57:31] <shesek> I'm pretty sure knowing the native DOM API would've save you a lot of time debugging and trying to figure out why stuff doesn't work as expected
[19:57:58] <shesek> !g joelonsoftware law of leaky abstraction
[19:58:04] <shesek> ? joelonsoftware law of leaky abstraction
[19:58:06] <bot-t1> shesek, Couldn't find "joelonsoftware law of leaky abstraction" in jQuery Docs.
[19:58:14] <shesek> how do I search damn google here
[19:58:24] <shesek> http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html
[19:58:55] <engineglue1> snover: I'd actually appreciate a critique from a real professional. I wrote this function to save a users email address by calling a PHP script. http://codepad.org/kqFUGQXg
[19:59:39] <shesek> .append('<input type="hidden" id="emailGeneric" name="email" value="'+email+'" />')
[19:59:46] <shesek> you probably shouldn't be doing that
[19:59:49] <eXodus12> Possible easy fix, no clue where I'm going wrong, have all but one thing working.. http://jsfiddle.net/CPVNK/
[19:59:54] <engineglue1> shesek: I've gotten pretty good at debugging js
[20:00:04] <engineglue1> shesek: what's wrong with that?
[20:00:12] <shesek> .append($('<input />').attr({type: 'hidden', id: 'emailGeneric', name: 'email', value: email}))
[20:00:25] <shesek> would probably work better
[20:00:35] <engineglue1> shesek: why would it be different?
[20:00:56] <shesek> if your email contains special characters (`"` is a valid character in an email) it won't work as expected
[20:01:20] <engineglue1> shesek: I'll have to try that, hold on.
[20:01:55] <snover> not puking a DOM element into a form just to send the data via ajax would probably work better
[20:01:56] <engineglue1> shesek: php is catching it and stating it's invalid
[20:02:14] <shesek> than PHP is wrong
[20:02:19] <nachitogil> hey guys, any idea how can I make callbacks in some positions during an animation? I'm using this plugin http://www.openstudio.fr/jquery.panorama/
[20:02:21] <engineglue1> snover: how would you do it? It was the only way I could figure out how.
[20:02:35] <Eruadan> i was lookin into this lib http://typeface.neocracy.org/ would i be able to integrate with jquery?
[20:02:40] <engineglue1> shesek: " is not valid in an email address
[20:02:55] <shesek> it is valid
[20:03:08] <engineglue1> shesek: I have never seen an email address with "
[20:03:22] <snover> and yet…
[20:03:28] <shesek> its not common, but it is valid
[20:03:32] * shesek is looking up the relevant RFC
[20:03:46] <engineglue1> yahoo.com says it's not alloed
[20:04:04] <m0> ngharo: they are not errors, I want to see their errors, I am seeign if a page 400 (tells me the post has been deleted)
[20:04:14] <webPragmatist> can anyone point me to a already built image manipulation "suite" in jquery? It just needs to be able to resize then crop
[20:04:27] <m0> I guess it is a Chrome feature where XHR errors are logged in the console.
[20:04:45] <shesek> engineglue1, they can choose to allow whatever they want, it doesn't mean anything
[20:04:50] <engineglue1> shesek: you may allow a " on your linux box but the general consensus is that it's invalid. haha even the built in PHP email check code says it's invalid and so does Yahoo.com
[20:04:59] <engineglue1> shesek: i know that
[20:05:16] <engineglue1> shesek: im just sayin
[20:05:22] <webPragmatist> similar to v
[20:05:23] <webPragmatist> http://kroppr.rborn.info/index.php
[20:05:55] <eXodus12> Possible easy fix, no clue where I'm going wrong, have all but one thing working.. http://jsfiddle.net/CPVNK/
[20:05:56] <engineglue1> shesek: why fight the actuality when the consensus is easier?
[20:06:15] <engineglue1> anyway
[20:06:31] <engineglue1>  $('<form>')  doesn't do anything
[20:06:44] <engineglue1> do i need to give it attributes?
[20:07:44] <shesek> engineglue1, regardless of whether or not you want your website to work properly with all email addresses that are valid according to the RFC, stuffing attributes into elements, especially when they come from dynamic user input, using string concatenation isn't a great idea
[20:07:50] <shesek> what do you expect it to do?
[20:08:07] <engineglue1> shesek: thanks
[20:08:08] <shesek> it creates an element, but it doesn't add it to the document
[20:08:18] <engineglue1> shesek: where does it go?
[20:09:07] <miketaylr> that's what she(sek) said
[20:09:13] * miketaylr sees himself out
[20:10:15] <engineglue1> shesek: how about I explain what I want to do and you help me figure it out? :) I'd like to submit variables to a php script which returns a result. I've been using a generic form in the footer but I know there must be a better way. I figured I could create the form object on the fly and delete it after I get the result from PHP.
[20:10:17] <shesek> engineglue1, nowhere. its outside the document, until you add it there
[20:10:40] <shesek> engineglue1, why on earth would you do that, when its much easier to do with ajax?
[20:11:16] <engineglue1> shesek: That's fine, I can use ajax. All I know is jquery and the post function.
[20:11:47] <engineglue1> shesek: which has been working just fine.
[20:12:07] <engineglue1> shesek: i would like to know a better way though. Where can I learn ajax?
[20:12:08] <shesek> than... use it? $.post('/path/to/your/script.php', {email: email, ...}, function(result) { })
[20:12:23] <engineglue1> shesek: i am using post
[20:12:32] <engineglue1> hold on
[20:12:56] <engineglue1> shesek: I can add variables to the post command? holy cow
[20:13:05] <engineglue1> shesek: i feel so stupid now
[20:13:36] <shesek> there we go: http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.html#sec-3.2.5
[20:13:51] <shesek> and http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3696.html#sec-3
[20:14:03] <engineglue1> haha nice
[20:14:10] <shesek> In addition to quoting using the backslash character, conventional double-quote characters may be used to surround strings. For example "Abc@def"@example.com "Fred Bloggs"@example.com
[20:14:30] <coldhead> that's a great way to stop people emailing you
[20:15:04] <engineglue1> yeah
[20:15:15] <shesek> engineglue1, what use did you have for post without adding any data to it? oO
[20:15:25] <shesek> * missing the word `function`
[20:15:47] <engineglue1> shesek: dude, I was appending input elements to a generic form and then using post to submit that generic form.
[20:16:03] <engineglue1> shesek: apparently I misunderstood how it works.
[20:16:19] <shesek> you somehow used $.post with forms?
[20:16:26] <engineglue1> yeah
[20:16:35] <shesek> that... doesn't make any sense :O
[20:16:39] <engineglue1> using serialize
[20:16:44] <shesek> $.post has nothing to do with forms
[20:16:54] <engineglue1> 	$.post('./save/email.php', $("#generic").serialize(), function(data) {
[20:17:11] <engineglue1> that line submits the form id generic
[20:17:24] <engineglue1> it works yo
[20:17:58] <shesek> didn't you ever think that instead of creating a form and using .serialize(), you an just create the data yourself? :O
[20:18:20] <shesek> I'm sorry mate, but that's a serious FAIL
[20:18:37] <engineglue1> shesek: yeah, that's why I thought it was retarded and came here to ask you for a better method. haha
[20:18:49] <engineglue1> i tried it your way and now it's not working
[20:19:04] <shesek> define not working?
[20:19:19] <engineglue1> it's not posting to the php script now
[20:19:24] <coldhead> functionaln't
[20:19:45] <engineglue1> http://codepad.org/vYJJVbxo
[20:20:56] <shesek> looks fine to me; how do you figure its not submitted to PHP?
[20:21:05] <engineglue1> I made a change and now it's working $.post('./save/email.php', {'email': email}, function(data) {
[20:21:08] <shesek> have a look on firebug/developer tools, you should see the request being made
[20:21:25] <engineglue1> email needed to be in quotes
[20:21:27] <shesek> object literals in JavaScript don't require quoting the property keys
[20:21:39] <shesek> (in JSON you do have to, tho)
[20:21:47] <engineglue1> shesek: it was probably conflicting since the variable had the same name
[20:22:01] <shesek> nope. it should work fine
[20:22:06] <engineglue1> it did'nt
[20:22:12] <shesek> it must be something else that changed and caused it to start working
[20:22:13] <engineglue1> it did after i put it in quotes
[20:22:15] <engineglue1> :)
[20:22:19] <shesek> try changing it back and see how it still works
[20:22:22] <engineglue1> that's all i changed
[20:22:23] <engineglue1> ok
[20:22:26] <engineglue1> hold on
[20:22:32] <shesek> >> var email=123; {email: email};
[20:22:36] <shesek> js> var email=123; {email: email};
[20:22:39] <shesek> .. var email=123; {email: email};
[20:22:42] <engineglue1> you're right
[20:22:42] <shesek> v8> var email=123; {email: email};
[20:22:45] <engineglue1> what the hell
[20:22:52] <engineglue1> javascript cache maybeL
[20:22:53] <shesek> FU!U@U!#!> var email=123; {email: email};
[20:22:56] <engineglue1> it works now
[20:23:04] <shesek> (the bot, not you)
[20:23:16] <shesek> what's the syntax for that thing?
[20:23:31] <engineglue1> i meant "what the hell, it's working now"
[20:23:59] <engineglue1> shesek: you have made my life a little easier today. THank you. :) what else do you know? haha
[20:24:10] <shesek> heh
[20:24:11] <shesek> you welcome
[20:24:22] <engineglue1> no more DOM's for me!
[20:24:25] <engineglue1> ;)
[20:25:25] <shesek> why won't you make your PHP accept all valid emails?
[20:25:33] <shesek> I hate it when websites don't let me use `+` in my email address
[20:25:48] <shesek> here's a simple regex that can validate emails according to the RFC:
[20:25:48] <shesek> http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
[20:25:53] <engineglue1> shesek: I'm just using the built in PHP email check
[20:26:43] <engineglue1> is that a functionL
[20:27:12] <engineglue1> shesek: php says + is invalid haha
[20:27:37] <engineglue1> shesek: this is the command I'm using if(!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)){
[20:27:48] <shesek> php is wrong :-(
[20:27:54] <engineglue1> shesek: i agree with you
[20:28:03] <_gates> lol
[20:28:11] <_gates> hi
[20:28:18] <engineglue1> I once worked in a database with over 1,000,000 users, I don't recall seeing an email address with a +
[20:28:19] <engineglue1> haha
[20:28:28] <_gates> What are you trying to do?
[20:28:36] <engineglue1> who?
[20:28:46] <_gates> anyone ;]
[20:28:52] <engineglue1> _gates: cool
[20:28:55] <engineglue1> :)
[20:29:08] <_gates> poop
[20:29:25] <shesek> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43402
[20:29:36] <engineglue1> I was thinking about setting up a php api which I can call from ajax to pull different data for a webpage. Do you think this is a bad idea?
[20:29:43] <shesek> been filled 5 years ago :-(
[20:30:06] <shesek> engineglue1, google lets you add `+anything` after your username
[20:30:21] <engineglue1> shesek: good for google :)
[20:30:22] <shesek> if your email is engineglue1@gmail.com, you can also use engineglue1+abcd@gmail.com
[20:30:40] <engineglue1> shesek: why would you want to do that?
[20:31:17] <shesek> I use it to filter emails away from my inbox, so I have stuff like `shesek+mailinglists@gmail.com`, `shesek+forums@gmail.com`, `shesek+spam@gmail.com`, etc
[20:31:20] <engineglue1> shesek: you're right, it works.
[20:31:35] <shesek> which goes to their own folders instead of cluttering my inbox
[20:31:47] <engineglue1> shesek: damn dude, you have some mad skills. that's a cool idea. Super nerd stuff.
[20:32:07] <shesek> ... yeah, but lots of sites won't accept it :-(
[20:33:33] <engineglue1> shesek: yeah, probably because the people who made those sites (including me) didn't know you could do that. That's pretty cool.
[20:33:40] <shesek> you see? now don't you want super nerd people to be able to use your site with their mad skills?
[20:33:54] <engineglue1> shesek: actually, you scare me a littel.
[20:34:03] <shesek> heh, why?
[20:34:13] <engineglue1> shesek: that was called humor.
[20:34:17] <engineglue1> ?humor
[20:34:22] <bot-t1> engineglue1, humor - jQuery Plugin repository - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/humor
[20:34:43] <engineglue1> oops
[20:34:51] <shesek> that was a jQuery Plugin repository?
[20:34:53] <engineglue1> that was also meant to be humorous
[20:34:59] <engineglue1> haha apparently
[20:35:33] <engineglue1> shesek: are you a developer for a living?
[20:35:41] <engineglue1> shesek: freelance or employed?
[20:35:52] <shesek> employer, actually
[20:35:57] <engineglue1> shesek: cool
[20:36:05] <engineglue1> shesek: very cool
[20:36:06] <shesek> I have a small company with two partners
[20:36:24] <engineglue1> shesek: i see
[20:36:40] <engineglue1> shesek: california?
[20:36:45] <eXodus12> Possible easy fix, no clue where I'm going wrong, have all but one thing working.. http://jsfiddle.net/CPVNK/
[20:37:10] <shesek> engineglue1, nope, Israel
[20:37:20] <engineglue1> shesek: are you American?
[20:37:33] <shesek> eXodus12, what's the problem exactly?
[20:37:40] <engineglue1> eXodus12: what do you want to happen?
[20:37:42] <eXodus12> It's in the comments.
[20:37:58] <eXodus12> I want the value of each to be returned on change/update of either the input or select
[20:38:06] <shesek> oh, I didn't notice the comments
[20:38:09] <eXodus12> but when I modify one, the value of it displays as undefined and visa versa.
[20:38:28] <eXodus12> Pop up Firebug, change the select and change the input number and you'll see what I mean.
[20:39:48] <engineglue1> in jquery, should currentIngredients be servingType?
[20:40:15] <engineglue1> it works that way? cool.
[20:41:13] <eXodus12> Yeah, the issue is the undefined part.. not sure why it's doing that since I'm selecting it's sibling..
[20:41:28] <shesek> eXodus12, .siblings() doesn't return the current element
[20:41:35] <shesek> try .parent().children() instead
[20:41:49] <engineglue1> maybe you could change $(this).siblings.... to $('#servingType').val(); and add an id to the select tag????
[20:42:09] <shesek> I guess he has multiple servingType in each page
[20:42:13] <eXodus12> childrenyeah
[20:42:25] <eXodus12> yeah there will be multiple div's with each a input and select type
[20:42:31] <engineglue1> i see
[20:43:12] <engineglue1> smart stuff
[20:43:43] <shesek> you should probably use `.closest('li').find(..)` so it won't be so tightly coupled with your DOM structure
[20:43:57] <eXodus12> hmm
[20:44:14] <shesek> (instead of `.parent().children()`, that is)
[20:44:35] <shesek> http://jsfiddle.net/CPVNK/2/
[20:45:46] <shesek> and the `^` in your selectors means "starts with", it seems like you don't need it
[20:46:05] <shesek> input[name=thename] should work just as well, probably a bit faster
[20:46:49] <eXodus12> Great shesek that seems to work, now to test with multiples.
[20:47:58] <eXodus12> Seems great, thank you!
[20:49:33] <shesek> you welcome
[20:53:45] <coldhead> i don't know how to stop vomiting since i've been working in an office
[20:54:25] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window :D
[20:57:19] <JonathanNeal> hiya
[21:11:02] <eddyb> so I have a script, included from a html file. can I get the path from which the .js file is loaded, from within the script?
[21:12:24] <_gates> With the JQuery native drag and drop, Can I make it so I have 20px by 20px boxes with background colors and drag and drop over eachother to replace them?
[21:15:04] <coldhead> sure, _gates
[21:15:07] <_gates> hi
[21:15:12] <_gates> coldhead:  how would i go about that
[21:15:23] <_gates> i assume its like make drop able, and set a var and switch them?
[21:15:35] <coldhead> you would style the elements with the colours and sizes you want
[21:15:46] <coldhead> and then have a callback in the droppbale
[21:15:48] <tetradon> I'm trying to use ajax and php to upload a file. This is possible strictly just using jQuery and no other special plugins, correct?
[21:15:50] <coldhead> droppable*
[21:16:02] <coldhead> that notes the colour of the most recently dropped thingy
[21:16:41] <_gates> coldhead:  heres what im using to give u an idea
[21:16:41] <_gates> http://jsfiddle.net/XxXdT/
[21:16:42] <stephenb> does anyone know why .add would reorder my elements when non of them have been attached to the dom yet?
[21:17:14] <coldhead> _gates: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[21:17:16] <_gates> Oh I see the document on
[21:17:17] <_gates> yea
[21:17:18] <_gates> lol
[21:17:28] <coldhead> steal from those nice simple examples
[21:17:32] <coldhead> i won't tell anyone
[21:18:07] <coldhead> tetradon: ajax file loading requires either an iframe and years of your life or just use a nice plugin that does it for you
[21:18:11] <coldhead> and is tested
[21:18:15] <coldhead> and debugged
[21:18:23] <coldhead> then you can get on with your life <3
[21:18:37] <tetradon> lol
[21:18:40] <_gates> coldhead:  so the call back on droppable this refers to the not moved element?
[21:18:40] <coldhead> stephenb: that doesn't sound right
[21:18:46] <_gates> how do i get the moved elementes bg color?
[21:18:52] <tetradon> I did try the iframe method but I can't get it to work
[21:19:03] <coldhead> i can't remember the specifcs i'm sorry _gates
[21:19:08] <coldhead> this is one of those try it and see things
[21:19:17] <coldhead> i just remember it's terribly straightforward
[21:19:35] <_gates> coldhead:  fair enough :]
[21:19:43] <coldhead> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#accepted-elements
[21:19:58] <coldhead> it's $(ui.draggable).css('background-color') or some such
[21:20:18] <coldhead> tetradon: if the iframe method didn't work (and it IS a pain in the ass) you should use a plugin
[21:20:20] <coldhead> like this guy
[21:20:27] <coldhead> ?g blue imp jquery upload
[21:20:28] <bot-t1> coldhead, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[21:20:44] <coldhead> one plugin, hours of your life and sanity reclaimed
[21:20:45] <tetradon> I hate loading plugin scripts for a task that seems so seemingly easy lol
[21:21:00] <coldhead> ajax file uploads is easy if you don't have to support IE!
[21:21:06] <stephenb> yeah, I didn't think it made any sense too. and the order that it picks appears completely random. I start off with an empty jquery object, and add new elements to it via a loop. about half way through, the order goes all weird on me
[21:21:12] <coldhead> until then, world of pain
[21:21:15] <tetradon> hmmm, true
[21:21:28] <coldhead> tetradon: also a plugin gives you someone else to blame
[21:21:32] <coldhead> which is important
[21:24:45] <SinnerNyx> hey guys, i'm having some trouble getting my code to work on chrome. i didn't use standard jQuery animations and I'm wondering if thats why. can you guys maybe help me either figure out whats wrong or how to get what i'm trying to do by adding a custom animation style to jQuery? My code appears to work on FF btw.
[21:24:46] <stephenb> tetradon: I actually just did an ajax file upload from scratch using an iframe and it was pretty easy (I thought) to set up. basically, I put the form in the iframe and forwarded the click event from the fake input on the page to the file input inside the iframe. then I just called submit on the iframe when all was done.
[21:24:49] <SinnerNyx> http://beta.orcaweb.ca
[21:25:08] <SinnerNyx> Clicking on the whale starts the effects.
[21:25:19] <SinnerNyx> why doesn't it work in chrome like it does in FF?
[21:25:47] <m3x> why is php +i? :(
[21:26:35] <tetradon> stephenb: this is, I want to want to submit a form the conventional way. I want to use a change event handler on the file dialog window and then use ajax to call my php script and grab the image and upload it.
[21:26:56] <tetradon> geeze that was a mess
[21:27:00] <tetradon> let me retype that
[21:27:45] <tetradon>  stephenb: Thing is I don't want to submit the form with a submit button. I want to use a change event handler on the file dialog window and then use ajax to call my php script and grab the image and upload it
[21:28:50] <tetradon> I'm beginning to think this is impossible
[21:29:00] <stephenb> easy enough. then call submit on the iframe when the input value changes
[21:29:33] <tetradon> stephenb: hmmm call a submit on the iframe...
[21:29:37] <tetradon> that might work
[21:29:41] <tetradon> thanks I'll give it a try
[21:29:48] <stephenb> yep
[21:35:06] <destryalhmns> hi, back after earlier embaressment
[21:38:14] <ndss56> hi, trying to get links to show background when clicked. almost there. need some help. see http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/2/
[21:40:49] <destryalhmns> when a li is clicked you want a response?
[21:41:51] <ndss56> http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/3/
[21:41:53] <ndss56> worked it out
[21:42:04] <ndss56> not sure its the most elegant way of doing it
[21:44:04] <destryalhmns> i dont think you can css background... but you can css background-color:Green;
[21:46:01] <Gonad|Emo> so im using History.js
[21:46:14] <Gonad|Emo> and i bind up the adapter for state changes
[21:46:16] <defendguin> http://pastie.org/3501941  does this look right?   doesn't look like my events are firing
[21:46:44] <Cork> ndss56: why don't you just use css :active ?
[21:47:00] <ndss56> Cork: can you show me please in my jsfiddle?
[21:47:00] <Gonad|Emo> but in there when i do History.getState(); I get no title
[21:47:16] <destryalhmns> ^you can sniff history with css and document.compute...
[21:47:45] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/5/
[21:47:51] <Cork> or do you want to toggle them?
[21:48:15] <ndss56> let me see. not sure why you mean by toggle
[21:48:38] <Cork> that after clicking the link it should stay green
[21:48:49] <Cork> even if you ex. click in a text area
[21:49:10] <ndss56> yes toggle
[21:49:34] <Cork> do you need the a tags?
[21:49:41] <ndss56> yes
[21:49:45] <Cork> that is, are you going to provide hrefs?
[21:49:50] <ndss56> yes
[21:49:53] <Cork> (that isn't #)
[21:49:59] <Cork> ok
[21:50:39] <Cork> ndss56: then ya, what you did is the most robust way to do it
[21:50:49] <ndss56> :)
[21:51:07] <ndss56> how would you do it without href #
[21:53:24] <destryalhmns> $(whatever).bindorlive(."click", function() {alert("is this working?");});
[21:53:54] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/6/
[21:54:50] <Cork> ndss56: using a tags when its not links is... wrong
[21:55:12] <tetradon> stephenb: thanks I got it to work
[21:55:41] <tetradon> finally! Been working on this problem all damn day lol
[21:55:44] <ndss56> Cork: why do people something do href="#" when its not really a link? is your way the new way of doing it?
[21:55:44] <destryalhmns> wrong is wrong for several months now
[21:55:48] <destryalhmns> html6 in 1 yr
[21:56:11] <Cork> ndss56: cause they want the user to be able to focus the thing by keyboard
[21:56:21] <Cork> ndss56: but tabindex does the same thing
[21:56:35] <Cork> ndss56: not really the new way, it has worked for ages
[21:57:01] <ndss56> Cork: you prefer tabindex over # for non-links?
[21:57:07] <Cork> yes
[21:57:18] <destryalhmns> ^yeah
[21:57:19] <Cork> href="#" shows up as link targers
[21:57:35] <Cork> and its symantically wrong
[21:57:40] <Cork> its not a link
[21:57:49] <Cork> its an element with a click action
[21:58:00] <ndss56> Cork: so you basically never use href="#"?
[21:58:04] <Cork> yes
[21:58:24] <Cork> i use href="#something" or href="fallback/url" or not a link at all
[21:58:37] <Cork> (where #something does the sme thing with js off)
[21:58:42] <destryalhmns> safe to use !# for detecting native back button?
[21:58:51] <destryalhmns> on a non-gay s\page
[21:58:59] <destryalhmns> sry, non gay page
[21:59:31] <ndss56> Cork: ok thanks
[21:59:32] <Cork> sme==same
[22:00:39] <ndss56> oh whats the css for pointer again?
[22:00:48] <Cork> cursor: pointer
[22:00:58] <ndss56> thats the one.
[22:02:13] <ndss56>     <li class="foo" tabindex="0">Link 1</li>
[22:02:13] <ndss56>     <li class="foo" tabindex="1">Link 2</li>
[22:02:57] <Cork> 0 positions the element in a tab order following the dom tree
[22:03:15] <Cork> of you most of the time can just leave it at 0
[22:03:42] <ndss56> you read my mind. ok.
[22:04:38] <Cork> -1 means it can take focus, but isn't in the tab order
[22:07:12] <destryalhmns> i dont think you can tab order on a web page
[22:07:20] <destryalhmns> you are thinking native app?
[22:07:21] <Cork> you can
[22:07:27] <destryalhmns> without hard work?
[22:07:34] <Cork> yes
[22:07:39] <destryalhmns> nm
[22:07:50] <destryalhmns> explicit?
[22:08:19] <destryalhmns> haHAAAAAAAAA
[22:08:59] <Cork> destryalhmns: http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/7/
[22:09:06] <Cork> click the last link
[22:09:09] <Cork> then hit tab
[22:10:43] <ndss56> Cork: how to background first <li>. With a link I can do .trigger('click');
[22:11:20] <Cork> just run addClass('hasFocus')
[22:11:31] <Cork> or if you mean to move focus, then ya
[22:11:36] <Cork> trigger('click')
[22:11:40] <Cork> or just click()
[22:11:57] <destryalhmns> :first
[22:12:52] <destryalhmns> and do border not background for your reality check
[22:12:54] <ndss56> :first should do it
[22:13:04] <destryalhmns> border:1pc solid Black;
[22:13:08] <destryalhmns> x
[22:13:22] <ndss56> destryalhmns: ya just a demo :)
[22:13:26] <Cork> depends actaully
[22:13:29] <Cork> *actually
[22:13:39] <Cork> border has the problem that is shifts the element
[22:13:42] <destryalhmns> i do border and display:none for my reality checks
[22:14:07] <destryalhmns> or font-huge
[22:14:37] <Cork> unless your design needs an element to have a serten size
[22:15:46] <ndss56> FYI http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/8/
[22:16:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/9/
[22:18:06] <ndss56> clever
[22:18:06] <caniuse> ndss56: http://i.imgur.com/8rtrB.jpg
[22:18:27] <Cork> btw if you want the border to stay closer to the links dimention use something like http://jsfiddle.net/z5tSW/10/
[22:18:43] <destryalhmns> html5/ jquery/ css3 have made irc gay
[22:19:04] <destryalhmns> 3 links no idea, not willing to click them
[22:19:49] <destryalhmns> god forbid we link a microsoft (???)
[22:20:17] <destryalhmns> kinnect
[22:20:33] <destryalhmns> god forbid we start linking them plus some modern web shit
[22:20:59] <ndss56> Cork: yeh i know about inline-block ;)
[22:21:24] <Cork> ndss56: i meant more that it should go on the ul, and not the li
[22:21:29] <snover> destryalhmns: no, I’m mostly the one responsible for gaying up irc
[22:21:36] <snover> but thank you for noticing!
[22:22:49] <ndss56> Cork: yeh i noticed in your example.
[22:23:51] <destryalhmns>  I’m dont get that
[22:23:56] <destryalhmns> i am?
[22:24:00] <Cork> ndss56: but hey, theres many solutions, and witch one to use depends on what you want the design to look like :)
[22:24:10] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: surely you can use your words better than you are.
[22:24:21] <destryalhmns> sry for real ideas
[22:24:31] <destryalhmns> and why 3 links sucks more than actual happening
[22:24:54] <JonathanNeal> Are you a native english speaker?
[22:25:06] <ndss56> Cork: yeh no worries. thanks for your input.
[22:25:21] <_gates> coldhead:  thanks for the help again
[22:25:31] <_gates> coldhead:  i did get it to work if you'd like to see => http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/DC9XS/
[22:25:39] <Cork> destryalhmns, ndss56: another fun little css hack http://jsfiddle.net/APYwA/3/ :D
[22:26:37] <destryalhmns> cork, sry, whats it do if i may ask, this is my point about all the links
[22:27:04] <Cork> destryalhmns: jsfiddle is a pastebin like site
[22:27:11] <ndss56> Cork: man i'm not that bored :D
[22:27:19] <Cork> its just demos for css and html
[22:27:23] <JonathanNeal> Cork how is that working, madness!
[22:27:26] <Cork> (and in somecases js)
[22:27:38] <Cork> JonathanNeal: its actaully quite simple
[22:27:51] <Cork> browsers split the color down a corner
[22:27:59] <Cork> so if you have a red bottom border
[22:28:03] <Cork> and a green right
[22:28:19] <Cork> the cut goes down the bottom right corner
[22:28:31] <Cork> here you have the "arrow" as a colored border
[22:28:46] <Cork> and the two borders beside it is transparent
[22:28:54] <Cork> generating an arrow look :)
[22:29:26] <Cork> then you can add transform: rotate for added fun :D
[22:29:27] <JonathanNeal> Nifty.
[22:30:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/APYwA/4/
[22:30:28] <destryalhmns> in 2012 html5/css3/chrome-xyz(shit) dont we deserve crap we can instantly see
[22:30:41] <destryalhmns> windows popping up[
[22:31:02] <Cork> destryalhmns: your free to use svg if you prefer
[22:31:04] <destryalhmns> anyone want to see a lame css thign that i thought was shockingly cool?
[22:31:12] <destryalhmns> SVG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[22:31:17] <destryalhmns> check out raphael
[22:31:34] <Cork> already been using it for about a year in production
[22:31:38] <Cork> and close to 2 in dev
[22:32:06] <destryalhmns> cool cool, i got picked off from the help desk pit 5 months ago
[22:32:45] <Cork> i like its ploting
[22:32:50] <destryalhmns> so no one cares as usual?
[22:33:11] <Cork> cares about what?
[22:33:28] <coldhead> show us the thing
[22:33:34] <destryalhmns> basically it centers around a known css sizing property
[22:33:39] <destryalhmns> k k
[22:33:47] <destryalhmns> as if im not glad to talk about it...
[22:34:03] <destryalhmns> www.seanmchugh.info/player.htm
[22:34:04] <ndss56> interesting .click() can fire on elements that aren't even a link
[22:34:07] <coldhead> i'm glad to share this special moment with you
[22:34:14] <Cork> ndss56: sure
[22:34:14] <coldhead> sure can, ndss56 !
[22:34:16] <destryalhmns> the basic idea is the tiny youtube portal
[22:34:20] <coldhead> anything you can dream of
[22:34:36] <Cork> ndss56: you can bind events for click on everything that takes up space on a page
[22:34:51] <ndss56> very interesting indeed
[22:34:52] <Cork> ndss56: so inless you want to be able to focus the li, you don't need tabindex="0"
[22:34:59] <Cork> *unless
[22:35:12] <destryalhmns> ...apparantly its broke in ff
[22:35:17] <destryalhmns> use chrome
[22:35:44] <eddyb> can I do document.createTextNode('\n') faster in jQuery?
[22:36:06] <Cork> destryalhmns: this is basicallt what got me hooked on raphaël back in the day http://raphaeljs.com/pie.html
[22:36:19] <destryalhmns> yesh cork, yesh
[22:36:23] <Cork> eddyb: why would you want to do '\n' as a text node??
[22:36:24] <eddyb> s/faster/simpler/
[22:36:25] <JonathanNeal> eddyb: i dunno, not much faster than native.
[22:36:28] <destryalhmns> glad someone else appreciates it
[22:36:38] <destryalhmns> im sure you do too
[22:36:51] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: be positive.
[22:37:06] <eddyb> Cork: because I'm reconstructing a jQuery object
[22:37:08] <Cork> destryalhmns: what are you talking about?
[22:37:09] <gnarf> eddyb: ummm?
[22:37:18] <destryalhmns> raphael is really cool and a great compliment to jquery
[22:37:18] <eddyb> actually, nvm
[22:37:20] <gnarf> eddyb: /me shrugs
[22:37:33] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: Raphael js is really cool, yeap.
[22:37:39] <Cork> eddyb: is this in a <pre> tag or something?
[22:38:03] <destryalhmns> css zooming
[22:38:09] <destryalhmns> on the link i posted
[22:38:16] <destryalhmns> neurons zapping or not?
[22:38:21] <JonathanNeal> eddyb: sometimes using text nodes is fun, especially if it's easy for you - it will be faster than the browser parsing your string.
[22:38:24] <Cork> i can't wait for ie's that doesn't support svg instead of vml to die off
[22:38:38] <Cork> then you can use svg without the compatibility js
[22:38:43] <JonathanNeal> You mean ... IE<9 ?
[22:38:44] <ndss56> when you do $('li.foo').click() and you have multiple li.foo, what happens?
[22:38:49] <Cork> JonathanNeal: ya
[22:39:01] <JonathanNeal> Yea, we seem bent on killing IE<8 for now.
[22:39:09] <Cork> JonathanNeal: sadly thats going to be a long long time
[22:39:14] <Cork> ie8 will be the new ie6
[22:39:22] <JonathanNeal> Windows XP users can't use IE9, so that seems to be where the line is drawn.
[22:39:28] <Cork> exactly
[22:39:43] <destryalhmns> xp users expect their computers to fail
[22:39:52] <destryalhmns> respect your users
[22:39:57] <JonathanNeal> the lack of defineProperty on non-domnodes is really annoying in IE8.
[22:40:12] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: are those contrary statements?
[22:40:14] <eddyb> JonathanNeal: yeah, I guess some barebones DOM doesn't hurt :)
[22:40:18] <destryalhmns> no
[22:40:22] <destryalhmns> sort of
[22:40:27] <JonathanNeal> respecting your users is probably not expecting them to fail or expecting that they expect that.
[22:40:37] <Cork> JonathanNeal: actually i find ie constantly annoying :)
[22:40:51] <Cork> ie is always keeping the web back
[22:40:57] <destryalhmns> well my brother is smart and he makes sausages
[22:40:57] <JonathanNeal> eddyb: i like it, and it's fun sometimes too, but be warned it can waste your time and people will get on your case if you optimize too much.
[22:41:07] <JonathanNeal> I was just schooled for such a thing :D
[22:41:23] <JonathanNeal> snover: *cough* :D
[22:42:41] <cordoval> how to get sliders like these for sponsors http://www.20wpc.com/ ?
[22:43:20] <destryalhmns> any OS other the 7-8 or ubunto or leaopord/snowmountain is not cool
[22:43:35] <destryalhmns> if you have any other os you dont know anything at all
[22:43:35] <JonathanNeal> cordoval: those are usually called carousels.
[22:43:49] <JonathanNeal> find a jquery carousel plugin that you like and you can do them too :)
[22:44:04] <destryalhmns> plugins are not professional
[22:44:09] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: what were you running 10 years ago?
[22:44:12] <Cork> destryalhmns... that assumption is catually kinda annoying cause it just shows how little you know about os:es
[22:44:16] <destryalhmns> xp
[22:44:23] <JonathanNeal> so you didn't know anything at all then?
[22:44:42] <destryalhmns> i was a freshman
[22:44:50] <Cork> if you think ubuntu is the coolest thing linux can offer, then ya
[22:45:19] <destryalhmns> its not like unix can run the space shuttle in real time HA HA HAA
[22:45:22] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: i'm applying your logic to your own life.
[22:45:37] <destryalhmns> K
[22:45:43] <gnarf> troll
[22:45:51] <destryalhmns> 7 is the most practical os
[22:45:56] <destryalhmns> and im not a troll
[22:46:00] <tw2113> mmm Fedora
[22:46:03] <JonathanNeal> Why is it the most practical OS, destryalhmns?
[22:46:04] <destryalhmns> no
[22:46:21] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: why are other peoples qualitative ideas so much worse than your own?
[22:46:29] <destryalhmns> cause it works the easiest and every program is designed for it and it can run multiple screens
[22:46:37] <JonathanNeal> Quantify them if you think they are really inferior or superior.
[22:46:52] <gnarf> off-topic
[22:46:52] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: every program is designed for it?
[22:47:01] <tw2113> tell that to textmate
[22:47:09] <JonathanNeal> is jQuery designed for Windows 7?
[22:47:31] <destryalhmns> yes
[22:47:41] <destryalhmns> sry many questions
[22:47:50] <JonathanNeal> I think you answered mine just fine.
[22:47:54] <snover> destryalhmns: you’re boring. be less boring.
[22:48:07] <destryalhmns> if you dont design for 7 you are wrong
[22:48:20] <gnarf> wtf is "7"
[22:48:22] <destryalhmns> try to flip that
[22:48:34] <JonathanNeal> taht
[22:48:35] <destryalhmns> exposes real trolls
[22:48:42] <tw2113> i thought XP was still the most popular by use
[22:48:54] <Cork> it is
[22:48:55] <JonathanNeal> did I flip "that" to your satisfaction, destryalhmns?
[22:49:11] <snover> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM
[22:49:15] <destryalhmns> well actually gather some data on your own and then you can know instead of think
[22:49:17] <snover> this is all I am hearing
[22:49:22] <snover> this entire conversation
[22:49:27] <snover> every word that destryalhmns types
[22:49:29] <snover> is just another “lo”
[22:49:53] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: you don't need to frustrate other people.
[22:49:58] <destryalhmns> snover is a professional troll?
[22:50:00] <JonathanNeal> I'm sorry you're unhappy.
[22:50:05] <destryalhmns> ban him now?
[22:50:07] <JonathanNeal> I'm sorry you feel the need to be so contrary.
[22:50:08] <destryalhmns> or me
[22:50:11] <snover> BAN ME NOW
[22:50:16] <destryalhmns> pls
[22:50:31] <snover> that’ll show that guy
[22:50:40] <destryalhmns> lol
[22:50:44] * tw2113 kicks snover 
[22:50:47] <destryalhmns> wow dude
[22:50:59] <destryalhmns> you are what i would call a massively entrenched troll
[22:51:00] <destryalhmns> or
[22:51:03] <JonathanNeal> If you want to talk about jQuery maybe that will make you more happy :)
[22:51:06] <destryalhmns> you .. a wart
[22:51:09] <gnarf> off-topic
[22:51:18] <destryalhmns> can we change troll to wart?
[22:51:20] <destryalhmns> sorry
[22:51:26] <snover> oh, shit, this channel is about jquery?! I’m sorry I was under the impression that it was the windows 7 + fuck all of you channel
[22:51:39] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: anything in jQuery able to make you more happy?
[22:51:46] <gnarf> snover: thats only from 06:40gmt til 06:50
[22:51:51] <gnarf> times up
[22:52:04] <destryalhmns> sure
[22:52:15] <JonathanNeal> awesome.
[22:52:22] <destryalhmns> i had a jquery html5/css3 thing link posted
[22:52:23] <destryalhmns> but first
[22:52:37] <destryalhmns> why do you allow the wart here before you accept me
[22:53:03] <JonathanNeal> jQuery Carousels make me happy like http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_simple.html
[22:53:30] <gnarf> allow?
[22:53:35] <destryalhmns> he has multiple names
[22:53:35] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: think about jQuery.  It's going to make you feel better.
[22:53:50] <destryalhmns> and attacks anyone he thinks he can get away with attacking
[22:53:57] <JonathanNeal> Remember when someone was asking about jQuery carousels?
[22:54:02] <JonathanNeal> This makes me happy too http://thomaslanciaux.pro/jquery/jquery_carousel.htm
[22:54:04] <gnarf> i don't think we could stop snover
[22:54:13] <gnarf> JonathanNeal: nope
[22:54:18] <JonathanNeal> destryalhmns: don't those make you happy?
[22:54:21] <destryalhmns> so before we get into knowledge of jqueyr or client side scripting or beyond
[22:55:10] <JonathanNeal> If that didn't send you into cosmic happiness maybe this will http://www.pixelzdesign.com/blog_view.php?id=55 WOW 33 JQUERY CAROUSEL PLUGINS!
[22:55:34] <gnarf> JonathanNeal: and how many of them fail in the few builds of jQuery with requestAnimationFrame? :)
[22:55:55] * JonathanNeal explodes into rainbows and fully funded education for children of low income families.
[22:56:32] <Cork> gnarf: uh, has jquery finnarly gotten around to shifting over to it?
[22:56:46] <gnarf> Cork: it landed in 1.6
[22:56:47] <Cork> *oh
[22:56:50] <gnarf> Cork: then got removed
[22:56:55] <Cork> heh
[22:56:56] <gnarf> we haven't put it back
[22:56:58] <Cork> why?
[22:57:18] <gnarf> because there was some idiot who yelled at us about backwards compat or somethin
[22:57:28] <Cork> uh...
[22:57:31] <gnarf> actually - because there are some issues with it
[22:57:39] <gnarf> and it doesnt really improve performance at all
[22:57:45] <Cork> and what prevents setInterval to work as a fallback?
[22:57:46] <gnarf> i fought to keep it around
[22:58:23] <Cork> gnarf: depends i've used it, and as animation frame doens't trigger if what you animate is off screen
[22:58:30] <Cork> it actually helps alot
[22:58:33] <JonathanNeal> requestAnimationFrame in jQuery, what?
[22:58:38] <gnarf> Cork: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe
[22:58:52] <gnarf> Cork: i will gladly make you a custom build with it in it
[22:58:55] <miket3> I have an app with Datables/Themeroller. ANd of course IE doesn't show the drop-downs properly. I cant find any fixes on google search.
[22:58:59] <gnarf> its really easy to plug back in
[22:59:09] <gnarf> i actually was maintaining a branch with that for a bit
[22:59:18] <gnarf> because i wanted that ability
[22:59:32] <Cork> gnarf: do you have a link for the demand of it getting backed out?
[22:59:32] <gnarf> to not suck up battery life with pointless animations
[22:59:45] <gnarf> Cork: read the thread
[22:59:46] <Cork> ya, same here
[22:59:50] <miket3> why do we put up with IE.....  all developers should add code to automatically download FF or something else when an IE browser navigates to their site.
[22:59:51] <Cork> perfect
[23:00:16] <Cork> gnarf: and the best part is that no animation work is needed when the focus is in another tab
[23:00:32] <eddyb> oh yeah :)
[23:00:34] <eddyb> http://jsfiddle.net/yfBsW/8/
[23:00:40] <Cork> and that saves a ton of cpu cycles on my comp (i normaly have three digits number of tabs)
[23:01:26] <gnarf> "So why are we going to remove the entire branch of code that uses requestAnimationFrame when adding the flag to support will give the stubborn people who can't be bothered to learn the correct way an "easy out" and still allows those of us who know what we are doing to have pages that aren't going to waste clock cycles animating in a hidden browser tab. "
[23:01:40] <JonathanNeal> thanks for the conversation, #jquery
[23:03:40] <eddyb> I had to write two utility functions, one to deep-collect contents (also adds a <br> where a <div> doesn't have a <br> before, this is a <pre> container)
[23:04:37] <eddyb> another to get the actual text from that contents array, replacing <br> with \n
[23:05:13] <gnarf> cork: i'm hoping to get rAF back in in 1.8
[23:05:17] <gnarf> with a vengance
[23:05:27] <Cork> :D
[23:05:43] <Cork> gnarf: i totally agree with your first comment at least
[23:05:50] <Cork> seen it and experienced the same
[23:06:02] <Cork> (still reading)
[23:06:42] <Cork> gnarf: i read and followed the implementation bug for raf a bit back (back in jq 1.3)
[23:06:49] <Cork> but i lost track of it since
[23:07:39] <gnarf> thats one of those fights that i just lost eventually
[23:07:43] <gnarf> not even sure how
[23:08:49] <gnarf> realistically http://jqbug.com/9381 is why we lost rAF
[23:09:14] <gnarf> which upsets me
[23:09:26] <gnarf> because the title of that "bug" is exactly WHY we want to use it in the first place
[23:09:27] <Cork> ya...
[23:09:27] <gnarf> :)
[23:09:49] <Cork> ya, thats the hole point of it
[23:10:16] <Cork> what i find interesting is, how many break from the new setInterval/setTimeout browsers use now days?
[23:10:38] <Cork> both sm and v8 change the min interval in inactive tabs
[23:10:50] <eddyb> hmm, how can I have undo/redo work on contenteditable elements, if I replace the contents on every change (I re-highlight the text inside every time)?
[23:10:56] <Cork> if i remember correctly it goes from like 4ms to 300 ms
[23:11:12] <gnarf> 9381 was a good ticket too
[23:11:27] <gnarf> i wrote some good content because of that ticket
[23:11:56] <gnarf> i almost made a slide about it at jqcon
[23:13:34] <Cork> lol that would have been fun
[23:15:12] <xaxxon> how do I make a div flow in from the right and another one go out to the left without scroll bars showing up and without a seam between them?  I've tried messing with left/right and such.. and I don't want to hard code browser widths and stuff in.. having a hard time figuring out how to start
[23:15:23] <xaxxon> I'm trying to imitate iOS style application
[23:15:37] <xaxxon> click a menu item and the details window slides in from right.  hit back button and the list slides back in from left
[23:15:38] <xaxxon> etf
[23:15:40] <xaxxon> etc
[23:15:48] <Xotix> Does anyone know a good file browser?
[23:16:10] <gnarf> Cork: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUEM5KsNiCM
[23:16:12] <gnarf> :)
[23:16:28] <Cork> Xotix: file browser?
[23:16:32] <Cork> you mean for the server?
[23:16:57] <GuruRAM> far2 :)
[23:17:38] <gnarf> i think this one was my favorite bug reading: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlzfJurRLHE&feature=related
[23:17:46] <Cork> gnarf: heh
[23:18:22] <Xotix> Cork, actually i thought of one which uses input type=file and removes my problems having with ie. I know, JS itself can't access the filesystem of the user.
[23:18:40] <gnarf> although DaveMethvin kinda blew me out of the water with: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7muqT0fSDk&feature=related
[23:18:42] <Cork> Xotix: you would have to use flash or java then
[23:19:05] <eddyb> gnarf: wtf
[23:19:19] <gnarf> eddyb: i did a breakout session at the last jqcon
[23:19:37] <gnarf> where i invited a bunch of the team members to pick out a bug report for a "dramatic reading"
[23:19:58] <gnarf> was like a full hour of laughter
[23:20:17] <gnarf> scott and richard did a good job too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfkJXJLZXN4&feature=related
[23:21:23] <Cork> :)
[23:21:33] <powertool08> I reused some older code for an accordion and it works ok with google's jquery 1.7, but not with 1.8.anything. What could cause this?
[23:22:31] <eddyb> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5aAhNk4Ws
[23:24:00] <gnarf> eddyb: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-N-tnloxn0&feature=related
[23:27:21] <eddyb> oh, the laughs
[23:28:17] <eddyb> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQUHaNsiwyE
[23:28:26] <gnarf> heh
[23:28:31] <gnarf> the jamacian
[23:29:31] <gnarf> ben_alaman does a horrible italian
[23:29:34] <gnarf> lol
[23:30:27] <gnarf> omg <3 DaveMethvin
[23:30:42] <eddyb> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfkJXJLZXN4
[23:30:55] <gnarf> snover's featured there at the end of that last one
[23:31:06] <gnarf> snover replys "Thanks, but this is not a jquery bug"
[23:31:22] <gnarf> yeah - autocomplete
[23:31:26] <gnarf> aka "the view source bug"
[23:31:43] <gnarf> the ".box" "does all magic" one is pretty awesome too
[23:31:51] <GuruRAM> autocomplete rocks
[23:32:49] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT3xdUueZZA&feature=related ;)
[23:33:34] <gnarf> oh- heres the .box one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=SgSn60GoeNI
[23:34:58] <gnarf> i think we made a .box widget that weekend
[23:35:10] <gnarf> that picked a random jquery ui widget and ran it
[23:35:19] <gnarf> it does "all magic" right kborchers?
[23:36:40] <gnarf> eddyb: hope you got some good laughs out of those
[23:36:44] <gnarf> i know we did
[23:37:13] <Xotix> Cork, i need to auto open the file input if you click on an img. Maybe i can use some activeX or something?
[23:38:26] <gnarf> Xotix: you can't
[23:38:36] <gnarf> Xotix: at least not in a cross browser supported manner
[23:39:14] <gnarf> you can use flash/silverlight/etc
[23:39:25] <gnarf> but really - look for one of the many packages that does stuff like this
[23:39:25] <gnarf> http://www.plupload.com/
[23:39:32] <gnarf> ive used that in the past and was happy with it
[23:40:06] <Mapper99>  Any idea why I get scroll bars when I open my splash screen?  http://save-the-rain.com/SR2/save-the-rain-2.html  (Click "How much rain can you save" button if splash screen does not come up)
[23:40:21] <Xotix> I just need a fix for IE. I could check for it and include it. Don't like flash. Rather would make some layer fix and just show the file input. Ppl which are using the tool might not have flash and can't install it.
[23:41:27] <gnarf> Mapper99: because the div is larger than the window?
[23:41:39] <gnarf> you might just be able to set overflow: hidden on body
[23:42:17] <tetradon> Can .submit have a callback function?
[23:44:18] <Xotix> tetradon: if you submit it via $.post() you got one.
[23:45:15] <tetradon> Well not in this situation
[23:45:36] <tetradon> I'm dealing with submitting a file with ajax
[23:45:49] <tetradon> and not using any plugins either
[23:46:06] <tetradon> works but I want a callback function after the submit
[23:47:51] <miket3> Does IE do ANYTHING correct?
[23:47:55] <GuruRAM> i solved this problem with http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[23:48:03] <tw2113> download other browsers, miket3
[23:48:27] <cesaro> ie seems to completely die iwth datatables editable
[23:48:27] <cesaro> mfw
[23:48:31] <Xotix> He said he does not want ajax and plugins
[23:48:37] <miket3> tw2113, i use other browsers my customers are on ie
[23:48:48] <tw2113> tell them to use it for that
[23:49:02] <djQuery> gnarf, had to go through all those vids to make sure nothing I submitted was in there
[23:49:05] <miket3> i am trying to solve a select box problem and now i have an baseref probelm
[23:50:20] <miket3> cesaro, ie dies on everything
[23:50:20] <GuruRAM> want a callback, see form plugin sources it does have one.
[23:50:36] <cesaro> -.-
[23:50:55] <gnarf> tetradon: see the ajaxForm plugin
[23:50:58] <gnarf> it allows files
[23:51:05] <gnarf> does it with an iframe trick
[23:51:16] <tetradon> I don't want to use a plugin, lol
[23:51:20] <tetradon> I know of that plugin
[23:52:04] <gnarf> tetradon: so what - not using a plugin means you can't look at how a plugin that does what you want works?
[23:52:09] <gnarf> read its source
[23:52:11] <gnarf> figure out how they do it
[23:52:26] <GuruRAM> steal/copy some code from it then :)
[23:52:27] <tetradon> I already have this working "almost" without using that
[23:52:43] <gnarf> tetradon: if you want a callback you need to use an iframe for the target
[23:52:46] <tetradon> I don't know, I was thinking maybe I could echo a javascript call to a function
[23:53:04] <gnarf> and hook into the iframe
[23:53:08] <gnarf> its pretty straightforward
[23:53:11] <gnarf> look at the plugin
[23:53:29] <tetradon> GuruRAM: lol, nice
[23:54:07] <Cork> gnarf: i find the bugs a bit suppricing; why are everyone complaining about chrome; it was mozilla that came up with it
[23:54:23] <miket3> jquery dropdownchecklist doesn't even show up at all in ie
[23:54:50] <tetradon> Basically everything works without the plugin. I just want to call a javascript function
[23:54:59] <walidvb> hi guys, i'm trying to bind a handler to the resizing of a div(as in, when the div changes size, run a function)
[23:55:12] <gnarf> tetradon: i give up
[23:55:18] <tetradon> I tried echo but since I'm using an MVC (for whatever reason) it can't call the function
[23:55:27] <walidvb> i tried to $(div).bind('resize', function(){})
[23:55:44] <gnarf> tetradon: you obviously can't be bothered to research someone elses code that succesfully does what you want, so why should I help
[23:55:56] <Mapper99> >>><gnarf>  Thanks, overflow worked like a charm!
[23:55:59] <gnarf> walidvb: there is no event for that
[23:56:09] <tetradon> gnarf: thanks for the effort but I don't think you are following me
[23:56:31] <walidvb> gnarf: is there any other way?
[23:56:53] <gnarf> tetradon: i am - it sounds like you're reinventing a wheel - lemme know if it works out
[23:57:28] <GuruRAM> tetradon: how do u post file to the server?
[23:57:30] <gnarf> walidvb: sure there is...
[23:57:45] <gnarf> walidvb: why would the div resize in the first place?
[23:57:48] <walidvb> thing is i am doing horizontal scrolling page, so i need to resize the container(with correctWidth()), but the inner divs change widths as well
[23:58:02] <gandalfu> ?
[23:58:04] <mattyh88> i'm trying to set a textbox with the value from a json object like this: but it keeps giving me the error: "missing ] after element list". But I can't find where to put this in the code? https://gist.github.com/f086b1331392298cf820
[23:58:14] <tetradon> Forget about what I'm trying to do here, lol. How would you propose I do a callback function from a submit call?
[23:58:20] <tetradon> That's all I'm asking.
[23:58:52] <gnarf> tetradon: if you are talking about a "standard" browser submit - there isn't any way that works unless you use an iframe, and attach into its events
[23:59:09] <gnarf> tetradon: kinda like the .ajaxForm() plugin does
[23:59:16] <walidvb> so either i wait for the resize to finish, and THEN call correctWidth(which i find quite dirty), or I find another way, like monitoring the resize of the divs
[23:59:23] <gnarf> maybe its code might help you figure out the technique
[23:59:40] <GuruRAM> generate some js on server side, like $(function(){//ALARM!});
