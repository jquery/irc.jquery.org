[00:30:48] <coldhead> good job

[00:37:22] <krz> how d i get the value of an item that has been selected in the select element
[00:37:25] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[00:37:47] <krz> thanks

[00:38:51] <coldhead> er
[00:38:54] <coldhead> }}*

[00:44:24] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - how do I make #us.state_box appear only when the US is clicked? I'm looking at the way http://backspace.com/mapapp/javascript_world/ makes its city_boxes pop up on click, but I can't figure it out..
[01:00:56] <davetarmac> morning all
[01:02:54] <Robbster> davetarmac: :)
[01:03:15] <muzone> I FIXED IT!!!!!!! YEAAAA
[01:03:18] <muzone> MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!
[01:03:29] * muzone puts http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-oLqMwzvBY on full volume
[01:03:32] <davetarmac> OK, I was going to ask a question, but I don't need to now :)
[01:03:40] <davetarmac> jsFiddle helps :)
[01:09:07] <timing> muzone: can you easily color the countries up front in the paths object with raphaeljs?
[01:09:18] <timing> muzone: still looking for a map replacement in js
[01:12:31] <muzone> timing: yup, you sure can
[01:12:37] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - notice what happens when you click on the U.S. - how do I make everything else but that popup box darkened?
[01:21:51] <lng> please remind me how to work with returned JSON via AJAX
[01:22:09] <lng> msg.message >>> undefined
[01:22:17] <lng> do I need to eval it?
[01:22:48] <coldhead> god no
[01:22:56] <coldhead> dataType:'json'
[01:23:00] <coldhead> in the post call
[01:23:02] <coldhead> or whatever
[01:23:07] <coldhead> and it should extract it for you
[01:23:11] <lng> JSON.parse?
[01:23:15] <coldhead> it will often do it automatically
[01:23:16] <lng> ah, yes
[01:23:21] <coldhead> but if it doesn't, try the dataType
[01:23:23] <lng> thanks!
[01:34:15] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - when clicking the U.S. - how come launchWindow(state); from http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial won't launch my modal window? Am currently using document.getElementById(state).style.display = "block";.
[01:34:40] <muzone> (but that's not fully modal)
[01:42:02] <creati29> can anyone explain '||' please or tell me where I could read up about it as in if 1 = 2 || 2 = 4?
[01:42:36] <alexandroid> || means or
[01:42:48] <alexandroid> 1 equals 2 or 2 equals 4
[01:43:14] <alexandroid> wait.... really?
[01:43:49] <creati29> ?
[01:44:09] <alexandroid> that wasn't a troll?
[01:44:19] <creati29> not following you
[01:45:28] <timing> muzone: I created this map based in highcharts: http://jsfiddle.net/timing/Be5qZ/
[01:45:36] <creati29> oh sorry, you must be the guy who was born with an inherent knowledge of JS syntax and operators - nice to meet you!
[01:45:52] <alexandroid> sometimes people ask incredibly basic programming questions as a troll-like response to a sequence of basic-seeming questions.  I initially gave you the answer you seek - || is the OR operator, then I thought you were taking the piss.
[01:45:55] <alexandroid> I wasn't having a go at you
[01:46:10] <alexandroid> I thought someone was having a lend of me
[01:46:28] <creati29> nope, as frustrating as it may be, I do have to start from the beginning :P
[01:46:39] <alexandroid> no worries, perfectly understandable
[01:46:41] <blackspotwiggins> ?101 @ creati29
[01:46:50] <blackspotwiggins> damn bot is gone again
[01:47:00] <xec> if you want to do assignment, use "=", if you want to compare (equal), use "==="
[01:47:14] <muzone> timing: thats a mighty fine map man :)
[01:47:16] <blackspotwiggins> creati29, http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[01:47:23] <timing> muzone: it sure is, but very heavy
[01:47:55] <creati29> Thanks blackspot
[01:48:29] <muzone> timing: what you think of http://backspace.com/mapapp/javascript_world/ then?
[01:49:35] <timing> muzone: looks good, automatic color intensity based on some sort of volume would be awesome. For charting etc.
[01:49:42] <axle3d> is there a function that can clear/remove a <select> list (so that none is selected?)
[01:50:03] <axle3d> *a <select> list choice
[01:50:08] <muzone> timing: yeah that would be awesome indeed
[01:50:23] <muzone> timing: hey im about to finish off my map as well, you mind if i ask you a rather simple question?
[01:51:32] <timing> muzone: sure
[01:51:42] <muzone> thanks man..
[01:51:57] <muzone> timing: at http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - when clicking the U.S. - how come launchWindow(state); doesn't launch #US?
[01:52:50] <muzone> timing: the commented document.getElementById(state).style.display = "block"; launches it just fine - but without the new modal window features (which i got from http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial)
[01:53:41] <timing> muzone: The closure for the state var seems right, so that's not it probably?
[01:56:25] <timing> muzone: and the var over is not defined :-P
[01:57:32] <muzone> timing: thats probably a remnant from something else
[01:57:36] <muzone> timing: any clue what to do though?
[01:58:24] <axle3d> ** Let me change that, how do I make a <select> unselected?
[02:00:35] <timing> muzone: some debugging :-), how far is the code going :-P
[02:00:43] <timing> is the function even called
[02:00:48] <timing> is the state passed correctly
[02:01:02] <johnywp> hey all
[02:01:12] <timing> Hi Johny WordPress
[02:01:17] <johnywp> i am trying to load 2 versions of jquery
[02:01:29] <timing> do you also have two girlfriends?
[02:01:42] <johnywp> i would like to use a different variable for the 1st, and then load the actual one that will be used for everything else
[02:01:44] <johnywp> any ideas?
[02:01:56] <johnline3> forever alone :'}
[02:01:59] <timing> read the docs on noConflict
[02:02:04] <johnywp> i did
[02:02:15] <johnywp> but for some reason, i can't get it to work
[02:02:16] <timing> it returns the jquery object I think and then you can assign it to another global
[02:02:16] <johnywp> :(
[02:02:44] <johnywp> it's jXXX = noConflict()
[02:02:51] <johnywp> but not sure how to use it properly
[02:03:00] <johnywp> tried everything and nothing seems to work :S
[02:06:29] <thomaslfromZ> helo
[02:06:32] <thomaslfromZ> hello
[02:08:33] <xec> johnywp: noConflict() is not a function in the global scope, but a method on (the latest included) jquery object, so maybe try var jQwhatever = jQuery.noConflict();
[02:21:12] <thomaslfromZ> I have an input box, and empty the vlaue on focus. But if the user types something in/ has typed something the value should not be cleared again. makes sense, right ;-)
[02:21:24] <thomaslfromZ> is there an event like changed() ?
[02:21:33] <thomaslfromZ> cant find anything
[02:23:30] <screenminder> is there a default-value in the input-box?
[02:23:42] <thomaslfromZ> or a keypress() inside a input.focus() ?
[02:23:46] <thomaslfromZ> screenminder: yes
[02:23:56] <screenminder> only clear the value, if the value is like the default
[02:23:56] <thomaslfromZ> and it should get emptied
[02:24:28] <thomaslfromZ> I did that, but its a multilanguage site, so you have to edit the js for each language
[02:24:57] <thomaslfromZ> which I dont want to do
[02:25:22] <screenminder> or u define your own attribute "default" where the default-value is saves
[02:25:32] <thomaslfromZ> oh, read the default value in a varuable and then empty it
[02:25:58] <thomaslfromZ> man, somethimes I dont see the wood because of the trees....
[02:26:03] <screenminder> :)
[02:26:09] <thomaslfromZ> so simple
[02:30:42] <solsTiCe> hi. is there anything in jquery that could give me the size of a string in a given font ? a plugin ?
[02:30:58] <Robbster> size as in pixels?
[02:31:09] <screenminder> which size? Width, oder height? Oder FOnt-Size?
[02:32:13] <solsTiCe> size in pixel yes
[02:32:19] <solsTiCe> width
[02:32:38] <solsTiCe> font-size, I know I can get it with .css()
[02:33:19] <Robbster> never used it, but this may help. http://jupiterjs.com/news/set-inner-outer-width-height-with-jquery-dimensions-etc-plugin
[02:34:44] <solsTiCe> ok thanks
[02:36:53] <MrGoodbyte> hello, is it possible to have horizontal scrolling-enabled pages in jquery mobile?
[02:37:57] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - when clicking the U.S. - how come launchWindow(state); doesn't launch #US? document.getElementById(state).style.display = "block"; worked just fine - but it's without the new modal window features from http://www.queness.com/post/77/simple-jquery-modal-window-tutorial
[02:39:02] <thomaslfromZ> when you check the val of an input you compere it with === or with == ?
[02:39:08] <thomaslfromZ> compare
[02:46:40] <mariuscc> how do I search in an ajax response to see if a class exists ?
[02:46:54] <mariuscc> with jquery
[02:48:23] <mariuscc> anyone?
[02:49:01] <screenminder> @thomaslfromZ u have to compare with ==
[02:49:33] <thomaslfromZ> screenminder: why? isnt === more "proper" ?
[02:49:51] <arvind_khadri> Hi, how can I check if a element has text content. I am looking for the specific element, not its parent.
[02:49:54] <screenminder> but u compare a value ... a string
[02:50:13] <screenminder> === compare type-correct
[02:50:17] <thomaslfromZ> an === is?
[02:50:41] <screenminder> true === "true" is false
[02:50:44] <thomaslfromZ> isnt === compare type-correct AND value?
[02:52:51] * thomaslfromZ is reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators
[02:54:09] <thomaslfromZ> losson learned: The standard equality operators (== and !=) compare two operands without regard to their type. The strict equality operators (=== and !==) perform equality comparisons on operands of the same type.
[02:54:13] <thomaslfromZ> lesson
[02:54:38] <thomaslfromZ> I think in my case it makes no difference
[02:54:45] <screenminder> great listing ...
[02:57:06] <innociv> "if( typeof data.topic != 'undefined' )" = "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'topic' of undefined" ... What?
[02:59:05] <juha_> data is undefined?
[03:02:00] <Heshanh> how do i stop a form from submitting
[03:02:33] <neophyte__> Hi ..
[03:03:24] <juha_> Heshanh: event.preventDefault()
[03:03:24] <neophyte__> I need to find the form element inside a div. I have a variable called container which has this div. Can anyone help me in this
[03:04:14] <juha_> neophyte__: $(container).html("lol")
[03:04:40] <juha_> neophyte__: or $(container).find("div").html("lol")
[03:04:59] <neophyte__> I need to get the form element inside the div
[03:05:32] <juha_> neophyte__: or $(container).find("div form").html("lol")
[03:05:52] <neophyte__> Ok thanks
[03:06:32] <arvind_khadri> Hi, how can I check if a element has text content. I am looking for the specific element, not its parent.
[03:08:27] <arvind_khadri> Here is what I have tried http://jsfiddle.net/msbfg/1/
[03:08:33] <thomaslfromZ> arvind_khadri: you want to check if <div>some text</div> <div>234 423 </div> <div>+ (34)5654 564 45</div> first and last div = true?
[03:09:45] <arvind_khadri> thomaslfromZ, no, not really, I want to get the element <p> if <div><p>Hello</p></div> is there.
[03:09:48] <Robbster> arvind_khadri: seems very expensive?
[03:10:32] <thomaslfromZ> and if <div><p>Yello</p></div> not?
[03:10:50] <thomaslfromZ> what about if <div>Hello</div>
[03:10:59] <Robbster> thomaslfromZ:  given that, I think that arvind_khadri wants to return the 'P'
[03:11:18] <seutje> $('div > p:contains("Hello")')
[03:11:34] <seutje> not sure if that's case sensitive though, I refrain from using :contains
[03:12:03] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, Hello is just an example.. thomaslfromZ
[03:12:17] <seutje> "The text must have matching case to be selected." guess it is
[03:12:50] <Robbster> arvind_khadri: do you know what text you are looking for?
[03:13:33] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, no, and actually I don't need to, I just want to check if the element has text content, if it has then get that element :)
[03:13:50] <thomaslfromZ> then you can check .length()
[03:15:07] <arvind_khadri> thomaslfromZ, could you please tell me how do I use it :)
[03:18:07] <Robbster> wouldn't you need to check for a TEXT nodetype as a child of any DOM element? I'm leaving jquery now and looking at the DOM directly...
[03:18:09] <thomaslfromZ> if ( $('#myDiv').length ){}
[03:19:11] <blackspotwiggins> thomaslfromZ, how does that determine if the element has text content?!
[03:19:23] <thomaslfromZ> it does not
[03:19:45] <blackspotwiggins> then why would you suggest that solution?
[03:20:22] <muzone> At http://home.no/dwaynie/map/map3.html - can you see why #us.state_window won't appear when clicking on the U.S.? I'm trying to do that "Simple Window Modal" from http://www.queness.com/resources/html/modal/jquery-modal-window.html
[03:20:57] <thomaslfromZ> if ( $('Div > p > *').length ){}
[03:21:00] <thomaslfromZ> better?
[03:21:18] <hokapoka> When using $("<pre>") to create an element that I'm going to append, how can I also set it's text, w/o using var ref = $("<pre>"); ref.text("some value"); ?
[03:21:33] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, ya.. you are right..
[03:21:36] <blackspotwiggins> thomaslfromZ, not really
[03:21:45] <thomaslfromZ> damn
[03:21:57] <hokapoka> oh, $("<pre>some value</pre>") works.
[03:22:19] <hokapoka> I'm sure I used to have difficulty with it & closing tags., nm.
[03:25:30] <MeirD> Hello
[03:25:40] <MeirD> How can I change the value inside a text input field?

[03:26:35] <innociv> juha_, sorry for the late response but no it's not
[03:26:44] <Ozd> Hi guys

[03:28:47] <juha_> Ozd: console.log($(x).find("b").html());

[03:48:07] <Robbster> arvind_khadri: you should be able to optimise the selector to reduce the number of times that the loop executes, but the 1st 'if' should be pretty quick,
[03:48:12] <ningia> I can't find how to use not in a complex selection, es $(".firstclass .secondclass:not img[myattr=myvalue]")
[03:48:42] <ningia> well... it maches only elements with secondclass... but I want the opposite
[03:49:02] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, thanks a lot :)
[03:49:27] <ravenzz> :not('.secondclass')
[03:49:27] <ravenzz> ?
[03:51:12] <ningia> ravenzz: $(".firstclass :not(.secondclass) img[myattr=myvalue]") doesn't function for me... :(
[03:51:16] <vindolin> is there a jquery way to find out, through which elements a click event traveled before hitting document?

[03:53:42] <tauame> Its getting me an error when it receives the server response

[03:55:49] <jcrawford-home> Connor are you around?
[03:56:06] <ningia> ravenzz: <div class="firstclass"><img that I need to select/><div class="secondclass"><img that I don't want to select/></div></div>
[03:56:38] <ningia> ho to exclude the second div?
[03:57:28] <ningia> sorry for my bad english and lack of terms to explain it better.. :(
[03:57:29] <juha_> ningia: are you kidding me? $(".firstclass img")
[03:57:46] <ningia> jugstah: but it takes the second image too
[03:57:52] <ningia> jugstah: sorry
[03:57:57] <juha_> no it doesn't!
[03:58:00] <ningia> juha_: but it takes the second image too
[03:58:01] <ravenzz> ningia then $('.firstclass img') ?
[03:58:06] <juha_> your classes are different
[03:58:09] <ravenzz> oh juha
[03:58:13] <ravenzz> answered
[03:58:33] <ningia> div are nidificated
[03:58:43] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, JSLint is throwing up errors.. this is not defined in the loop
[03:58:44] <ningia> it takes the second image too
[03:58:47] <ravenzz> ningia show us a real DOM example
[03:59:05] <juha_> ningia: $(".firstclass img:not(.secondlass img)");
[03:59:18] <ningia> juha_: thanks
[03:59:49] <ningia> juha_: your example clarify to me the use of :not ... ^^

[04:03:24] <muzone> Is it a good idea to use http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home for pretty-printing? It seems to restructure the code a lot...
[04:03:44] <Robbster> arvind_khadri: ?
[04:04:06] <Robbster> wait, try now.
[04:04:13] <Robbster> http://jsfiddle.net/U5YGn/3/
[04:07:50] <arvind_khadri> Robbster, thanks a lot :) it works now
[04:09:27] <Robbster> just be careful with this as it is quite expensive. start with restricting the selector.I would also spend some time looking at why you think that this is needed - there may be a refactoring that you can do so that you don't need to do this..
[04:14:29] <sodapop> how can i focus to a dynamically created input e.g. $("input[name=vars[]]:last").focus();
[04:15:10] <Robbster> $("input[name='vars[]']").last().focus();
[04:15:19] <sodapop> thanks
[04:21:36] <creati29> can anyone suggest a reason why this would be incorrect if data.message is returning a value? jQuery('#feedback').text(data.message).fadeIn();
[04:23:59] <creati29> all that firebug says is jQuery( in red
[04:24:56] <iszak> creati29, possibly jQuery isn't defined.. who still uses firebug?
[04:26:35] <creati29> why whats wrong with firebug?
[04:26:49] <creati29> jQuery is defined though because everything else is working fine
[04:27:51] <iszak> creati29, it's not that anything is wrong with firebug at all, it's just a bit sluggish when compared to the Google Chrome developer tools.
[04:28:54] <creati29> i much prefer firebug
[04:30:17] <iszak> creati29, anyhow, we need more specific errors.
[04:30:40] <iszak> it's possible  that data.message is null/undefined and therefore jquery returns the text instead of setting it and therefore .fadeIn() fails because it's trying to be applied to a string.
[04:39:11] <Dreamstar> Hi there! Is it posible to change checkboxes and radio buttons with jQuery?
[04:42:23] <Segaja> Dreamstar: normally yes. it depends on what you want to do exactly
[04:43:54] <Dreamstar> I just wanna change the appearance of the boxes when they're unchecked and checked, ie change to some pictures

[04:44:36] <seutje> Dreamstar: I usually use uniform ^
[04:45:01] <Dreamstar> seutje: I see, is it free to use?
[04:45:51] <seutje> I certainly hope so
[04:46:17] <Dreamstar> I mean, free to use at any website and free to change as I want
[04:53:52] <seutje> Dreamstar: says it's MIT...
[04:54:01] <Dreamstar> Oh ok
[04:54:03] <Dreamstar> fine
[04:55:40] <miss_spelling> anyone know why the following selector isn't working in IE but works in all other browsers $('script[src*="globalPaperClick"]')
[05:01:31] <creati29> If i have this in my json
[05:01:33] <creati29> "message":"Welcome eDg3C18, you are now logged in!"
[05:02:03] <creati29> how do i put the welcome msg within a div, im trying $('#feedback').text(data.message); but its not working
[05:02:50] <RLa> is that valid json at all?
[05:03:36] <creati29> yeah thats valid json
[05:05:07] <creati29> can anyone help as to why that won't work?
[05:05:36] <RLa> i think valid json requires {} around objects
[05:06:03] <PrgmrBill> http://jsonlint.com/ it's not valid, try it
[05:06:50] <creati29> course it is, obviously the entire json has { } around it
[05:07:01] <creati29> that is just one piece of the entire JSON
[05:07:10] <creati29> but curly braces around my json then validate it again
[05:07:54] <miss_spelling> anyone have any ideas about the selector I'm trying to use?
[05:09:42] <miss_spelling> it's driving me mad, I've been trying to access the backgroundImage of the body tag on a site where ads are being injected, what I'm finding is that IE is preventing me from doing so due to filters being used for gradients etc.  What I'm trying to do instead is to trigger some behaviour based on whether or not a specific script has been injected on the page.  It works fine in all but IE browsers :(
[05:11:35] <joon> hi there, someone can help with datatables ? all is here, thx by advance http://jsfiddle.net/MZadC/1/
[05:12:41] <jomofcw> I've bind the "change" event of a SELECT element. How could I trigger it ? Doing a "$myOptionInMySelect.trigger('click');" doesn't do anything and "$myOptionInMySelect.attr('selected',true);" just select the option without trigger the change event...
[05:13:03] <Jon47> jomofcw, have you tried .trigger('change') ?
[05:16:56] <jomofcw> Jon47 yep I've tried to do a $mySelect.trigger('change') but it just doesn't do anything.
[05:20:13] <muzone> Is there anything you'd do differently with my new and supercool world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map/?
[05:20:45] <muzone> (only the U.S. is clickable at the moment)
[05:21:01] <Jon47> that doesn't seem right..
[05:21:23] <muzone> Jon47: what do you mean?
[05:21:27] <Jon47> muzone try this: http://jsfiddle.net/qmAsJ/
[05:21:54] <Jon47> .trigger('change') also works.. i think you've got some other bug in your code
[05:22:17] <muzone> Jon47: wrong guy
[05:22:21] <Jon47> uh sorry muzone
[05:22:26] <jomofcw> That's for me ^^.
[05:22:31] <jomofcw> OK i'll try.
[05:22:31] <Jon47> yeah ;)

[05:26:26] <Aquaguy> Hello
[05:27:17] <Aquaguy> is there any way to force the browser to download a file instead of opening it? for example a pdf <a href="uploads/file.pdf">Download Here</a>
[05:27:52] <Aquaguy> Doing that instead of downloading it, for example Chrome, displays the pdf
[05:33:29] <aple> Hey guys, I'm trying to assign the text in a label to the value of a textbox, I can do it, but it puts both text values in there... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/481056/
[05:33:46] <thomaslfromZ> Aquaguy: not really a jquery question, but it depends how you setup you browser and you computer. maybe acrobat is linking in between or whatever.
[05:33:59] <aple> Any suggestions for how to iterate through a set of labels and assign them to their appropriate textboxes?
[05:35:08] <thomaslfromZ> aple: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:36:21] <aple> Already there. ;)
[05:40:07] <slashiter> i have a doubt. how can i force a click in an element <a>?
[05:40:19] <PrgmrBill> trigger('click')
[05:40:54] <tauame> http://jsfiddle.net/CzW8W/
[05:41:21] <tauame> Its getting me an error when it receives the server response. it says "invalid label"
[05:41:34] <tauame> the JSON string he gets is fine, no error at all, but it keeps giving me a "invalid label" at javascript consolo
[05:41:41] <tauame> console
[05:43:38] <aple> Ok, I still don't get how to iterate over each element using .each(). This makes sense to me and I'd expect it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/hGRbS/
[05:44:42] <aple> Should go over each div in #signup, find the label text, put it in the input val, and go to next one
[05:44:42] <aple> I must be telling it to do it some screwed up way.
[05:44:44] <aple> Like, that = operator probably isn't doing the job.
[05:46:57] <slashiter> i tried trigger('click') but the click doesn't happen...
[05:47:42] <tauame> talking to me?
[05:48:19] <aple> nope
[05:48:25] <adrianp> in .each() can I reference the next element, something along the lines of: $(index+1).show()?
[05:48:34] <aple> I always forget how useless this channel of 800+ people is
[05:48:54] <aple> I think I've actually gotten decent help in here once or twice out of hundreds of visits
[05:49:01] <thomaslfromZ> aple: I think you val dont get anything
[05:49:41] <adrianp> i'm looking for some decent help
[05:49:58] <aple> thomaslfromZ: http://jsfiddle.net/hGRbS/2/
[05:50:13] <aple> adrianp: Have you tried next() ?
[05:50:24] <aple> http://api.jquery.com/next/
[05:51:22] <thomaslfromZ> aple: you input boxes have no value
[05:52:37] <aple> It should create/assign a val to them even if they're empty no?
[05:53:49] <sr972> aple: you wanna asign the labels text with the text of the input box? oO
[05:54:21] <aple> sr972: No, I want to assign the input's val with whatever is in the text of label
[05:54:29] <aple> Then I'm going to remove the labels
[05:55:14] <thomaslfromZ> no
[05:55:18] <thomaslfromZ> i got it
[05:55:37] <tauame> http://jsfiddle.net/CzW8W/2/
[05:56:03] <thomaslfromZ> aple: http://jsfiddle.net/HYGpw/1/
[05:56:08] <tauame> jsfiddle is not showing the json response in the consoloe :/
[05:56:34] <tauame> perhaps if u copy the code and paste into you own html, then u can see it
[05:58:05] <thomaslfromZ> aple you have to bind it to a submit or connect it to a keypress
[05:58:09] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: In case you missed it jQuery Mobile 1.0 RC1 coming next week: http://t.co/HqVocAyn â˜… http://bit.ly/nfeJCv
[05:58:47] <aple> thomaslfromZ: Thanks man! I completely overlooked where I was assigning that val. I should have been putting it inside the parens, not on the other side of an =
[05:59:10] <thomaslfromZ> aple: np
[05:59:58] <tauame> does anyone ever had the "invalid label" problem when using $.getJSON()?
[06:00:04] <tauame> Its getting me an error when it receives the server response
[06:00:17] <tauame> the JSON string it gets is fine, no error at all, but it keeps giving me a "invalid label" at javascript console
[06:00:28] <tauame> http://jsfiddle.net/CzW8W/2/
[06:03:27] <adrianp> aple: thanks, i just discovered it
[06:03:37] <adrianp> aple: is there a way to break out of .each()? return true; or something?
[06:04:04] <adrianp> just tried that, didn't seem to exit
[06:06:33] <RLa> adrianp, can't you use selector that does not include cases where you want to break out?
[06:07:00] <adrianp> RLa: i don't follow
[06:07:09] <cakehero> Anyone know why I would get an error trying to create a slider: HTML: 							<div id="sell-price-slider"></div> JS: jQuery('#sell-price-slider').slider(); // TypeError
[06:07:37] <cakehero> jQuery UI 1.8.10 Min is included
[06:07:47] <adrianp> currently: .each(function() { if ($(this).is(":visible")) { $(this).hide(); $(this).next().show(); return true });
[06:08:10] <cakehero> RLa you mean use a selector that accounts for visibility?
[06:08:23] <cakehero> RLa I didn't see your ? earlier I'm just guessing based on adrianp's answer
[06:08:32] <creati29> if i have a json that reads { "message" : "welcome you are now logged in" } how do i put the value of message into a variable?
[06:08:35] <adrianp> lol thats my question
[06:08:41] <cakehero> adrianp heh
[06:08:54] <cakehero> adrianp reask
[06:09:05] <cakehero> adrianp i mean there is this but IDK if it'll work for you: http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[06:09:16] <cakehero> creati29 message from where? AJAX call?
[06:09:27] <cakehero> creati29 var message = { 'message': 'welcome' }
[06:10:40] <DukeDrake> hi
[06:10:44] <adrianp> yeah i went about it the wrong way
[06:10:50] <adrianp> using a selector for visible worked
[06:11:07] <adrianp> $("#container > div:visible").fadeOut("fast").next().fadeIn("fast");
[06:11:13] <Ankabout> if I want to select the second sibling of a set of elements, I can do $(".element").index(2)  right?
[06:11:34] <adrianp> cakehero: RLa: thanks
[06:11:40] <cakehero> adrianp np
[06:12:12] <muzone> yo cakehero, finally done with my map man
[06:12:22] <muzone> http://home.no/dwaynie/map/ - anything I can do to simplify / improve it though?
[06:12:27] <cakehero> Ankabout i think '1' not '2'
[06:12:31] <coldhead> that's some nice fading, muzone
[06:12:35] <cakehero> muzone I can check it out
[06:12:40] <coldhead> and some nice lorem ipsbum
[06:12:44] <cakehero> Sweet
[06:12:48] <Ankabout> cakehero, yeah sorry typo, but I get an error...
[06:12:51] <Ankabout> oh wait...
[06:12:54] <Ankabout> lemme try something
[06:13:09] <muzone> cakehero:
[06:13:12] <muzone> no wait coldhead
[06:13:21] <muzone> damn im having trouble telling you guys apart
[06:13:26] <muzone> coldhead: yeah i know right?
[06:13:31] <cakehero> it does look good
[06:13:40] <cakehero> muzone I might make it a plugin or something
[06:13:44] <Ankabout> cakehero: 9Uncaught TypeError: Object -1 has no method 'show'
[06:13:44] <cakehero> but if it ain't broke
[06:13:47] <muzone> much obliged man
[06:13:52] <cakehero> Ankabout that sucks
[06:13:57] <Ankabout> haha
[06:14:06] <Ankabout> wait let me jfiddle it up
[06:14:14] <muzone> cakehero: there's no dont-repeat-yourself stuff i can do to it?
[06:14:22] <thomaslfromZ> if you talk to somebody, mention his name like muzone
[06:14:33] <cakehero> muzone maybe
[06:14:48] <cakehero> muzone what part of it do you think is written the worst
[06:14:52] <muzone> like all those var = null, false etc. too im hoping there's a prettier way of doing that
[06:15:14] <muzone> cakehero: probably the for loop.. am i right?
[06:15:28] <cakehero> muzone maybe
[06:15:32] <cakehero> muzone i think it's fine
[06:15:38] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/yXEab/5/
[06:15:40] <cakehero> muzone maybe some stuff you can do with CSS instead of JS
[06:15:49] <cakehero> that #mask stuff (but I'm not sure)
[06:16:26] <DukeDrake> how can I identify a <select> according to its html() value?
[06:16:30] <cakehero> Ankabout what are you trying to do
[06:16:44] <cakehero> DukeDrake use id's or classes
[06:16:46] <Ankabout> when I click the second list item, the second row should activate
[06:16:54] <Ankabout> likewise for 3rd and 4th row, etc.
[06:17:13] <DukeDrake> probably something along $('select')[val=""].add('selected','true')  ?
[06:17:13] <Ankabout> I'm just testing with an integer now in the fiddle to get the syntax right
[06:17:19] <cakehero> Ankabout how do i know if it's workin
[06:17:31] <Ankabout> the text on the right will becomevisible
[06:17:31] <muzone> cakehero: thanks :)
[06:17:55] <cakehero> Ankabout any reason you aren't using tabs ?
[06:18:07] <cakehero> Ankabout http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[06:18:27] <cakehero> DukeDrake you want to identify a select based on it's currently selected value?
[06:18:31] <cakehero> muzone good work
[06:18:36] <Ankabout> yeah cakehero, this is just a fiddle to get the syntax right, this isn't directly from my site
[06:18:40] <cakehero> Ankabout I'd suggest tabs
[06:18:47] <cakehero> Ankabout b/c it does all this for you
[06:18:56] <Ankabout> for my the layout and all is completely different
[06:19:01] <Ankabout> and the structure
[06:20:10] <DukeDrake> cakehero: no o.o
[06:20:15] <cakehero> Ankabout you can use get
[06:20:26] <cakehero> DukeDrake whats the [val=""] represent?
[06:20:30] <DukeDrake> probably something along $('select')[val=myneedle].add('selected','true')  ?
[06:20:55] <cakehero> Ankabout http://jsfiddle.net/yXEab/6/
[06:21:00] <cakehero> its ghetto fabulous though
[06:21:09] <cakehero> DukeDrake whats myneedle represent?
[06:21:22] <cakehero> DukeDrake the currently selected value of the select?
[06:21:26] <DukeDrake> a string
[06:21:33] <cakehero> ...
[06:21:34] <cakehero> dude
[06:21:35] <cakehero> work with me here
[06:21:39] <DukeDrake> NOT the currently selected value
[06:21:42] <cakehero> a string that is the value of the select?
[06:21:43] <cakehero> ok
[06:21:50] <cakehero> a string that is *a* value of the select?
[06:21:55] <cakehero> but not the currently selected one?
[06:21:57] <DukeDrake> oh,, it's about the options probably
[06:22:01] <DukeDrake> ?
[06:22:10] <cakehero> yes, options == values
[06:22:20] <cakehero> are you trying to get one option of the select?
[06:22:50] <DukeDrake> there are 20 option elements, like <option value="idontknowthis">But I do know THIS =)</option>
[06:23:19] <DukeDrake> so I want to 'select' the option element with html() like "But I do know THIS =)"
[06:23:27] <cakehero> ahh ok
[06:23:32] <cakehero> .val()
[06:23:57] <DukeDrake> ?
[06:24:04] <cakehero> you may have to loop
[06:24:05] <cakehero> one sec
[06:24:53] <DukeDrake> kk
[06:25:06] <Ankabout> cakehero, thanks trying it out
[06:26:00] <muzone> cakehero: do sleep on it though, and let me know if you come up with any suggestions
[06:26:16] <cakehero> DukeDrake jQuery('select option').each(function(i, em){ if(jQuery(em).val() == 'But I do know THIS =)') { your stuff }; });
[06:26:21] <muzone> i know this baby can be tighter
[06:26:26] <cakehero> muzone nah, don't do anything until you need to refactor it
[06:26:45] <muzone> but shes so close to perfection, why not go all the way?
[06:26:50] <cakehero> waste of time
[06:26:54] <cakehero> is why
[06:27:01] <muzone> i dont think like that
[06:27:22] <muzone> cakehero: http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/Land_Before_Time.htm
[06:27:57] <cakehero> Don't talk about my favorite movie in vain
[06:28:04] <DukeDrake> hm
[06:28:12] <muzone> hhhhh:)
[06:28:46] <cakehero> Ok will one of you plz fix my problem now
[06:28:51] <cakehero> which is like stupid simple, heh
[06:30:35] <DukeDrake> cakehero: what was your problem?
[06:32:35] <jpolan> hello all, is there a way to determine whether a mouse is currently in the state of being held down (on mousedown.mouseup detect it at the instant it happens but don't work for intervals). So far I have only found the hack of usein an interval
[06:32:55] <jpolan> *using
[06:33:03] <cakehero> Anyone know why I would get an error trying to create a slider: HTML: <div id="sell-price-slider"></div> JS: jQuery('#sell-price-slider').slider(); // TypeError
[06:33:03] <cakehero> works fine in JSFiddle
[06:33:03] <cakehero> maybe I'm missing a library
[06:33:40] <cakehero> jpolan detect it randomly?
[06:33:49] <cakehero> jpolan or when an event fires?
[06:34:13] <no0ne> hi, does fiddle support $.ajax ?
[06:34:16] <DukeDrake> cakehero: don't really know about libraries :/  The '-' in the id are ok, I guess?
[06:34:19] <jpolan> cakehero: Sorry for the unclarity, I meant when I press the mouse for say 5 seconds I would like to query that state
[06:34:50] <cakehero> jpolan I would do onmousedown + set interval for that
[06:34:52] <_dave_h_d> hi all, is mozilla hardware accelerating 2d or 3d gransforms?
[06:34:58] <_dave_h_d> transforms
[06:34:58] <cakehero> jpolan if you want to make sure it's pressed for a few seconds
[06:35:09] <DukeDrake> cakehero: btw, I found the .filter function : $('option').filter(function () { return $(this).html() == myneedle; }).attr('selected','true');  ^^
[06:35:38] <no0ne> can anyone check this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/gaA2J/1/ $.ajax is not working as expected, it does not return anything
[06:35:42] <cakehero> DukeDrake just another way to do it, same hing
[06:35:43] <jpolan> cakehero, the interval is actually not important, it's for a paint app so whenever I press the mouse button down I should draw
[06:35:56] <cakehero> jpolan i would do onmousedown set a variable
[06:36:11] <cakehero> onmousedown { start drawing } onmouseup { stop drawing }
[06:36:41] <cakehero> bbl
[06:37:19] <ccmonster> HOLA folks
[06:37:37] <darcyclarke> no0ne there's no ajax in that fiddle
[06:38:12] <jpolan> cakehero I tried that yet the behavior is strange it works on the first mousedown but then there is some inconsitency
[06:38:34] <jpolan> *inconsistency
[06:38:47] <no0ne> darcyclarke yeah wrong link, ill make a new one
[06:39:00] <Moody> Hi there :) ! got a little question. i'm sending an ajax request to retrieve some data. i'm using .statusCode() to handle 403 error. The page with 403 also render some json, i can retrieve it in the Response.responseText as string, how can i have it in json ?

[06:41:15] <ccmonster> No clue Rushing_ , not heard of that. Google to see if there are other people reporting that behavior
[06:41:34] <Moody> I've got a little question. i'm sending an ajax request to retrieve some data. i'm using .statusCode() to handle 403 error. The page with 403 also render some json, i can retrieve it in the Response.responseText as string, how can i have it in json ?
[06:41:34] <muzone> ccmonster: http://home.no/dwaynie/test/ (only America is clickable atm)
[06:41:58] <Rushing> yeah i saw some similar reports, but they were from like 2009
[06:42:09] <ccmonster> LOL@ the inuit chick
[06:42:19] <ccmonster> can you update your browser Rushing ?
[06:42:52] <muzone> ccmonster: that thing you were working on yesterday, think you can share it?
[06:43:02] <kurtp> hi guys, got some problem with ajaxSubmit and sortable. I wanted to have a form submit everytime a receive event is triggered. but it doesn't seem to update.
[06:43:13] <ccmonster> Ah, i looked at it for like 2 minutes then got pulled away
[06:43:16] <muzone> that uhm... json object thing
[06:43:23] <muzone> oh i see
[06:45:31] <ccmonster> Yea. you need to just traverse the json object, find the child, if you find the child, return the parent object (which will include the child), then iterate over those children with raphael and highlight all of those
[06:47:02] <cypha> what's a good way to show text, but when the text area is clicked, it's editable?
[06:47:06] <muzone> easier said than done though for sure!
[06:47:23] <muzone> ccmonster: im not sure if i can get any closer than https://gist.github.com/1235781
[06:47:51] <muzone> ccmonster: you mentioned map and grep functions? oh lord =)
[06:48:01] <ccmonster> well, those are options.
[06:48:12] <ccmonster> did you run your gist code and see if it output anything
[06:48:29] <muzone> nope, i can try
[06:49:17] <muzone> ccmonster: so i put console.log() in both those vars then?
[06:49:57] <ccmonster> right after your for(x in json), do a console.log('this:',x)
[06:50:35] <muzone> ccmonster: done - http://home.no/dwaynie/test/
[06:50:45] <abhinav_singh> $('#idname').val() returns the value ..but how do i set the value?
[06:51:03] <ccmonster> $('#idname').val('mynewval')
[06:51:29] <ccmonster> um, muzone, i cant see anything. Do a fiddle
[06:51:32] <ccmonster> jsfiddle.net
[06:51:48] <muzone> sure
[06:54:14] <muzone> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/q2HCA/
[06:54:41] <kurtp> hi guys, got some problem with ajaxSubmit and sortable. I wanted to have a form submit everytime a receive event is triggered. but it doesn't seem to update. Here is my code and html form http://pastebin.com/k6d0wXZ5
[06:55:16] <ccmonster> Well, I dont know if you need all that in your fiddle. really you just need the whole json object in there.
[06:55:22] <ccmonster> Hwat you have there is sort of a seperate fiddle
[06:55:38] <ccmonster> receive event?
[06:56:12] <muzone> ccmonster: should i take something out or?
[06:57:50] <ccmonster> well, i meant basically transferring your gist to fiddle
[06:59:16] <muzone> ooooh
[07:11:08] <ccmonster> anyone alive?
[07:12:27] <FNTom> ccmonster?
[07:12:40] <FNTom> Credit card monster huh?
[07:12:56] <ccmonster> lol no
[07:13:00] <Ankabout> http://www.drawastickman.com/
[07:13:02] <Ankabout> oops
[07:13:10] <Ankabout> wrong window
[07:13:52] <RLa> nice thing anyway
[07:19:54] <fuchstronaut> drawastickman is so nice :)
[07:23:16] <Ankabout> how can I ensure that one function is only executed once the previous one is done?
[07:23:24] <KOTRET> i struggle with a selector: i have <tr>'s, odd is with id and even is without and hidden. now i want to toggle the hidden by clicking on the ones with an id. in the click function i put $(this).next(). ... but it CREATES a <tr>-Element!?
[07:23:27] <creati29> how do i select a json object if it doesnt have a key?
[07:24:55] <ccmonster> [i]
[07:24:59] <ccmonster> use the index
[07:26:25] <creati29> as in data[2]?
[07:28:20] <Elephant> wat
[07:30:10] <smplstk> Ankabout, set a flag before hand, and change the flag once the function executes, thereby only allowing it to run once.
[07:30:44] <Ankabout> smplstk, I just figured out my function has a callback anyways :)
[07:30:47] <Ankabout> but thanks
[07:32:40] <smplstk> Ankabout, that's the most ideal situation
[07:33:44] <muzone> ccmonster: so what to do?
[07:34:04] <ccmonster> oh , sorry. got distracted
[07:34:20] <muzone> np
[07:41:33] <creati29> ahhh this is ridiculous sorry i know ive been going on about this alot, but if i console.log(data) and the result is this
[07:41:35] <creati29> {"error":"false","message":"Welcome eDg3C18, you are now logged in!"}
[07:41:46] <creati29> how do i display 'message' in my page?
[07:41:53] <FNTom> data.message
[07:42:03] <creati29> i've tried that but it won't work
[07:42:19] <ccmonster> muzone, here you go
[07:42:21] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JxV5C/
[07:43:12] <creati29> console.log(data.message) returns undefined?
[07:43:12] <kborchers> creati29: your json is probably just text then see ?parseJSON
[07:43:13] <bot-t> creati29, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[07:43:28] <ccmonster> That should get you most of the way
[07:43:30] <ccmonster> muzone,
[07:45:26] <muzone> ccmonster: niiiiiiiice
[07:45:37] * muzone shakes ccmonster's hands repeatedly
[07:45:41] <muzone> http://home.no/dwaynie/test/
[07:45:50] <ccmonster> you can probably clean that up a bit
[07:45:54] <creati29> when I log my data after the end curly brace I have 'null' why would that happen please anyone?
[07:46:26] <ccmonster> i'd speed up your fade to black
[07:46:31] <ccmonster> no need to make it so slow
[07:47:08] <FNTom> It's not slow here
[07:47:19] <muzone> ccmonster: the land hover or modal window?
[07:47:26] <ccmonster> the modal on click
[07:47:27] <kborchers> ?p @ creati29
[07:47:27] <bot-t> creati29, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:47:33] <ccmonster> the animation is sort of slow, atleast for my taste
[07:47:43] <ccmonster> you want it to be a touch snappy
[07:47:51] <FNTom> Oh yeah, that's slow. hah.
[07:48:11] <ccmonster> it's dramatic, but sort of makes you feel like it's sluggish.
[07:48:31] <muzone> ccmonster: i totally agree actually
[07:48:42] <muzone> i was planning to ask yall about that
[07:48:57] <ccmonster> now you just need to figure out, do you need just the region NAME, or do you need the countries apart of that region, or both?
[07:49:20] <ccmonster> because that determines what you return out of that json traversal
[07:49:50] <ccmonster> i just returned the parent name, you way actually want to return the V (the parent's actual array) to get to all the countries in that region
[07:49:53] <ccmonster> etc etc
[07:51:08] <creati29> this is my jquery http://pastebin.com/cPezDWwP
[07:53:05] <kborchers> creati29: ok, and after you use parseJSON, what's not working right?
[07:53:42] <creati29> heres chromes console response
[07:53:51] <creati29> {"error":"false","message":"Welcome eDg3C18, you are now logged in!"}null jquery-1.4.4.min.js:31Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token n
[07:53:57] <creati29> sorry abit hard to read
[07:54:08] <creati29> this console log of data
[07:54:09] <creati29> {"error":"false","message":"Welcome eDg3C18, you are now logged in!"}null
[07:54:19] <muzone> ccmonster: how do i figure that out? i mean is this where i start changing for(var country in map) { into for(var region in map) {?
[07:54:23] <creati29> and after trying to console log the var obj
[07:54:24] <creati29> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token n
[07:55:00] <roger_padactor_> what is the best way to center something in the middle of the page with position: absolute if the page can scroll?
[07:55:07] <kborchers> creati29: you need to get that null out of there on the PHP side. you should probably have PHP send the appropriate headers as well, then you don't need to do the parseJSON
[07:56:14] <kborchers> ?g php headers to serve json @ creati29
[07:56:15] <bot-t> creati29, PHP headers to serve JSON [php] [json] [header] - http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5882
[07:56:19] <ccmonster> well muzone , what do you need?
[07:56:21] <creati29> Thanks kborchers i'll give it a read through
[07:56:34] <ccmonster> do you need the country name, or do you need the country codes so you can hilight them?
[07:56:42] <josespinal> .j rails
[07:56:49] <ccmonster> i would think you need the array of country codes
[07:56:54] <orl> Hi!
[07:56:57] <davidboy> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong at http://dhserve.dyndns.org/welcome  Trying to hide the little "sheet" dialog with a clip effect
[07:57:22] <muzone> ccmonster: just the country codes i reckon?
[07:57:26] <creati29> lol done it
[07:57:26] <orl> Can I use stop() on a .load() function?
[07:57:29] <creati29> thanks kborchers
[07:57:35] <muzone> ccmonster: i mean the original svg only had 2-letter countrycodes, no names
[07:57:40] <davidboy> No matter what I do, it seems to just fade out and zoom towards the left top corner
[07:57:43] <kborchers> np
[07:57:45] <josespinal> oops
[07:57:46] <josespinal> :P
[07:57:47] <creati29> got so wrapped up in analysing my jquery that didnt think to check what my php was sending back, tunnel vision >.<
[07:57:53] <orl> (I guess I can't), and if not, what can I use to stop the loading of a div when trying to load something else?
[07:58:32] <ccmonster> ok, then you dont care.
[07:58:36] <ccmonster> so then you just return V
[07:58:53] <muzone> cool
[07:59:51] <enleth> Hi there. Is this a proper place for jQueryUI questions?
[08:00:47] <muzone> ccmonster: then its on to making for(var country in map) { into for(var region in map) {?
[08:01:08] <ccmonster> ok, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JxV5C/2/
[08:01:15] <ccmonster> that shows you the countries in the array
[08:02:00] <ccmonster> muzone, actually, there...http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/JxV5C/3/
[08:04:11] <ccmonster> muzone, are you trying to avoid hilighting a single country ever, and instead a whole region?
[08:04:12] <ccmonster> or what?
[08:04:21] <muzone> yes sir thats it:)
[08:04:40] <ccmonster> ok, so when I hilight US, i actually want to hilight North America
[08:04:40] <ccmonster> ?
[08:04:48] <muzone> yes
[08:05:01] <muzone> (does that include greenland by the way?)
[08:05:23] <ccmonster> good question, not sure. i dont think of Greenland as north America, but i dont know
[08:05:43] <enleth> I suppose it is. Can I somehow hook into jQueryUI code - without modifying it outright - to e.g. create additional elements inside of a button when it's created with $(".blah").button()? Say, if I want to use image-based borders or corners that require helper elements?
[08:06:13] <ccmonster> muzone, wheres that fiddle you had with EVERYTHING in it?
[08:06:45] <enleth> "Forking" jQueryUI to add this would be a maintenance and versioning nightmare for a project, so it's right out, and I'd rather hook into the jQueryUI code than build wrapper functions
[08:07:02] <muzone> lets see
[08:07:23] <muzone> damnit its gone, 2 sec
[08:08:10] <FNTom> enleth, yes. Avoid altering the UI codebase, it's pretty easy to hook into whatever you want but modifying the codebase would alienate a large amount of people who might want to use whatever you're making :)
[08:08:44] <muzone> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/JAaWg/
[08:09:10] <muzone> ccmonster: Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe
[08:09:16] <ccmonster> so it looks like that all you want to do  is put a function reference in there around where there the current && map[current] stuff happens
[08:09:37] <muzone> nice..
[08:12:22] <enleth> FNTom: so, how would I go about hooking in a function that is fired on every newly created button after UI is done with it? I'm reading http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/ right now, this looks like a way to get what I want, but there could be more to that
[08:12:54] <roger_padactor_> is jquery mobile just UI ?
[08:13:08] <mashcraft> no
[08:15:15] <FNTom> Okay enleth, first let's see if there's an easier solution than hooking.
[08:15:30] <FNTom> Is this something you could run once all buttons have been created?
[08:15:38] <FNTom> And loop through the buttons and do what needs to be done?
[08:18:32] <kborchers> enleth: couldn't you just use the create event in button to do what you need to do after the button is created?
[08:18:39] <ccmonster> muzone, little buggy, but getting close : http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/q2HCA/1/
[08:18:41] <enleth> FNTom: sure, that's what I *could* do on my own, but I'd rather write code that can be esily reused.
[08:19:03] <enleth> And learn how to do that to prepare for when I really need to extend a widget
[08:20:01] <enleth> Buttons, boxes and whatnot with image-based corners and borders are an everyday chore for me and I'm tired of writing them over and over with all those damn helpers
[08:21:25] <wild_oscar> can css() only be applied to one element? I wanted to change the background colour of a set of tr's and was trying the following without success: $(".activeToggle").parents('tr').css('color', 'green')
[08:23:35] <kborchers> enleth: this is how i extend Menu (both Menu and this extension are still in dev but should give an idea of how it's done) https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-extensions/tree/master/menu
[08:24:18] <kborchers> scott has a few here that may be helpful when learning as well https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions
[08:24:54] <Bower^> Hey. My site has Ajax search and it gets its data from some externel web API. I've noticed on slower connection that the search results don't always return in a sequential order so return values for older queries sometimes overwrite newer ones. My solution was to add each XHR object I create into some list and whenever a new request is made, the script iterates through the list and .aborts() each XHR object. This just doesn't work though. Does anyone have exp
[08:24:54] <Bower^> erience with something like this?
[08:27:45] <enleth> kborchers: thanks, this seems consistent with a few articles I've just found, so at least I know that the authors knew what they were writing about
[08:31:10] <DarsVaeda> I can do "$('#id').myfunction()" what is  the opposite of that?
[08:31:43] <DarsVaeda> I would call it "unbind" but is that what .unbind() does?
[08:31:46] <amon293_> hi!
[08:31:59] <amon293_> anyone here are confortable with nested tabs on easytabs? jquery?
[08:32:16] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: unbinding is the opposite of binding
[08:32:30] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: there is no "opposite" of "calling a function"
[08:33:25] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks
[08:35:35] <amon293_> anyone here are confortable with nested tabs on easytabs? i'm having a little rough time here...
[08:37:10] <muzone> ccmonster: also are there any parts of the code that can be made more DRY / reusable?
[08:37:43] <creati29> what is the result of serializing a password input?
[08:38:02] <creati29> same as serializing a text input?
[08:39:03] <muzone> ccmonster: like all those vars at the top there, hoping theres a way to clear those out, i dont know
[08:39:16] <creati29> i was sending login info to my server using ajax after serializing the form, but when I change the input type to password i get incorrect login message
[08:39:25] <creati29> the only thing i've done is change the input type from text to password
[08:40:56] <ngharo> link?
[08:44:29] <sphinxxx> creati29, how does the server parse it?
[08:44:58] <Bower^> ajpiano, what's a suitable .debounce() duration for functions that call web APIs?
[08:45:03] <FNTom> Are you sure you didn't accidentally change the name of that input?
[08:47:54] <creati29> ahh its ok now sorted it thanks though guys

[10:11:09] <enjoycrf> too primitive
[10:11:22] <Connor_> Great
[10:12:17] <enjoycrf> leme see lol i wana see whats up in css hahaha
[10:12:50] <enjoycrf> crikets
[10:13:17] <enjoycrf> im oficialy using BBQ
[10:13:19] <enjoycrf> every1
[10:13:25] <kinga> what does $() return if there was no element found for the selection ?
[10:13:27] <kinga> null ?
[10:13:32] <ajpiano> kinga: an empty collection
[10:14:07] <MoTiOnXml> enjoycrf: i don't agree; however, lots of people ask really stupid questions.
[10:14:42] <ajpiano> i stay in #css this way i can read back when people complain of perceived injustices
[10:14:52] <enjoycrf> dood im just kidding
[10:14:54] <enjoycrf> omfg
[10:15:21] <kinga> so uhm... how's the variable: var element = $('#element') ? i want to verify if it's empty or not
[10:15:32] <ajpiano> if (element.length) { }
[10:15:42] <enjoycrf> yes
[10:15:45] <kinga> ok thanks :)
[10:15:49] <enjoycrf> use length
[10:15:58] <kinga> i always forget about it
[10:17:30] <mashcraft> if any one around could help me with with a select box that is populated via ajax that would be appreciated. When I make the ajax call and change the options of the select and run a .checkboxradio("refresh") on the element the label gets messed and shows all the options in the select as the label
[10:18:12] <mashcraft> I can provide the url for the page this is happening on if its ok to paste a link here
[10:18:19] <Connor_> Yeah post the link
[10:18:31] <hlvehearttraffic> Hi Guys! TGIF!
[10:18:34] * hlvehearttraffic jumps
[10:19:06] <mashcraft> http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/
[10:19:19] <mashcraft> its happening on the make and model fields
[10:20:43] <hlvehearttraffic> GOOGLE+1 BUTTON, WHY YOU NO STYLE LIKE MY INLINE CSS TELLS YOU TO.
[10:20:44] <hlvehearttraffic> ;[
[10:21:25] <mashcraft> I have searched around but cant seem to find any one who has had this specific problem with jquery mobile
[10:21:50] <foo> mashcraft: #jquerymobile
[10:21:50] <Connor_> So it is when you click on search yeah?
[10:21:57] <Connor_> It shows all of them in a line
[10:22:24] <mashcraft> Connor_ on page load it goes and fetchis a list of makes and a list of models
[10:22:40] <mashcraft> injects the resulting html into the select
[10:22:58] <mashcraft> and then runs a .checkboxradio("refresh") on the element
[10:23:09] <mashcraft> and thats when it gets screwed up
[10:23:33] <mashcraft> now If i leave the refresh off the element on load it shows ok but once I select a different option it gets messed up again
[10:24:46] <mashcraft> foo thanks I will hop in there as well
[10:24:55] <foo> mashcraft: no problem! :D
[10:25:23] <Connor_> Hm, it seems the issue is with selectmenu() function?
[10:25:32] <Connor_> I don't know anything about that :/
[10:26:22] <mashcraft> Connor_: indeed. im going to post it in the mobile room as well and see if any one knows any thing. got to love working on the edge
[10:28:06] <mashcraft> Connor_: let me throw one more problem at you if you dont mind
[10:28:10] <Connor_> Sure
[10:28:14] <mashcraft> check this out http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/vehicle/vin/2HNYD28318H521733/sortdir/ASC
[10:28:37] <mashcraft> if you look at the dom with firebug you will notice its all there
[10:28:53] <mashcraft> but in the console its throwing an undefined error
[10:29:02] <muzone> the future's looking mighty gloomy ccmonster
[10:29:02] <mashcraft> for jQuery.event.special.orientationchange
[10:29:13] <muzone> now i know how them inuits must be feeling
[10:29:15] <ccmonster> haha. why is that
[10:29:16] <ccmonster> lol
[10:29:17] <ccmonster> drink up :)
[10:29:24] <muzone> hhhhh:)
[10:29:48] <muzone> well because you said this thing looks a lot harder than originally forecasted
[10:29:57] <Connor_> @mashcraft looking now
[10:30:03] <mashcraft> Connor_: ok
[10:30:24] <Connor_> Where are you calling orientation?
[10:30:39] <Connor_> Or are you not
[10:30:42] <mashcraft> Connor_: I'm not its some thing jquery mobile does on its own
[10:31:38] <mashcraft> Connor_: a check of the google reveals that this was reported as a problem and that it seems like it should be fixed at this point
[10:32:14] <Connor_> Using latest jquery.mobile?
[10:32:39] <mashcraft> Connor_: indeed
[10:32:42] <mashcraft> and newest jquery
[10:33:07] <Connor_> Can you use the full jquery instead of minified so I can debug easier/
[10:33:08] <Connor_> ?
[10:33:22] <mashcraft> Connor_: sure one second please
[10:34:41] <mashcraft> Connor_: there you go both are the non-min versions
[10:35:37] <Connor_> Thanks
[10:35:41] <Connor_> Just trying to trace it back to the issue
[10:35:51] <Connor_> My thought is that it dosen't work with 1.6.4
[10:35:59] <mashcraft> i just fixed it
[10:36:09] <mashcraft> I can't beleave that was it
[10:36:15] <Connor_> Lol kai
[10:36:36] <mashcraft> I moved the jquery mobile link in the head to right before the </head> tag
[10:36:53] <Connor_> Loading mobile before core?
[10:37:05] <mashcraft> no right after
[10:37:15] <kinga> to select  the 3rd element from a selection is this enough? $('selector')[2] ?
[10:37:16] <mashcraft> but for some reason it didnt like what ever code I was doing after
[10:37:31] <Connor_> Fair enough
[10:37:42] <Connor_> @kinga yes, though you can also use $('selector').eq(2);
[10:37:47] <mashcraft> Connor_: there is now a $.attrRN is undefined on there
[10:37:56] <kinga> ok, i guess using [2] is faster ?
[10:38:07] <Connor_> Probably, it's JS Core
[10:38:07] <kinga> than using a jquery function ?
[10:38:14] <Connor_> Google :P
[10:38:14] <sphinxxx> anyone user slideviewer pro?
[10:38:22] <sphinxxx> use*
[10:38:28] <mashcraft> Connor_: yea thats the next step
[10:39:08] <Connor_> mashcraft, remove touchstart at line 970
[10:39:19] <Connor_> IS that the erro you are getting?
[10:39:23] <Connor_> error*
[10:39:48] <mashcraft> Connor_: let me check
[10:40:12] <mashcraft> Connor_: yea its in there on line 977
[10:40:14] <Connor_> It is either the events aren't being recognized or the .each's reference is undefined
[10:40:49] <mashcraft> yea very odd
[10:41:05] <Connor_> Me thinks its the .each that isn't working
[10:41:19] <Eviltwin> "Guys! I found a bug in jQuery!"
[10:41:33] <Connor_> What if you console.log($) at line 968
[10:41:41] <Connor_> Wait
[10:41:45] <Connor_> No that will return jQuery
[10:41:51] <Connor_> Because it's getting past the each
[10:41:52] <Connor_> Hmm
[10:41:54] <Connor_> Very strange
[10:42:13] <mashcraft> yea a quick google really turns up nothing
[10:42:13] <Eviltwin> Where's this code?
[10:42:55] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/vehicle/vin/2HNYD28318H521733/sortdir/ASC
[10:43:03] <Connor_> attrFn isn't set
[10:43:11] <Connor_> Don't know what this is supposed to be though :P
[10:43:14] <ccmonster> hmm, why wont               var c = item.toUpperCase();
[10:43:14] <ccmonster>                 console.log('map',map.c.node);  gives me C undefined, but if i output c i get US
[10:43:22] <ccmonster> sorry, abotu the paste. oops. my bad
[10:43:34] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: line 997 on jq mobile is where the error is pointing
[10:44:23] <Eviltwin> $.attrFn is not definded?
[10:44:33] <Connor_> Seems to be the issue
[10:45:08] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: yup
[10:46:18] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[10:46:23] <Eviltwin> I think I see why
[10:46:28] <Eviltwin> This jquery.js that's included
[10:46:33] <Eviltwin> Is labeled v1.3.2
[10:46:52] <Eviltwin> You have jquery-1.6.4.js
[10:46:59] <Eviltwin> But also jquery.js
[10:47:04] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: where do you see the jquery.js?
[10:47:49] <Eviltwin> Line 61 of the HTML
[10:47:50] <DarsVaeda> hey, when using googleapis to load jquery-ui.min.js my datepicker is not working anymore and presumably some other functions, what error could it be?
[10:48:03] <Eviltwin> It is a script include for this: http://www.dealervideos.com/scripts/jquery.js
[10:48:08] <Eviltwin> I'm pretty sure that's what's causing your problems
[10:48:17] <Eviltwin> Ancient jQuery
[10:48:22] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: stupid 3rd party stuff. yea one sec let me nuke that
[10:48:24] <DarsVaeda> it loads relativly long 101ms from google
[10:48:47] <Connor_> And you are loading mobile before jQuery
[10:49:04] <Connor_> So jQuery isn't defined
[10:49:33] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: ok that solves that issue. would you mind taking a look at http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/
[10:49:50] <mashcraft> the make and model selects options are populated with ajax
[10:50:20] <mashcraft> and when I call .selectmenu("refresh") on each element it screws up the label
[10:50:39] <mashcraft> im referencing the info at the bottom of this doc http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-selects.html
[10:55:09] <Connor_> Question. Inside a .each() is $(this) the equilivant of caching?
[10:55:16] <Connor_> Or should I cache $(this)?
[10:55:51] <mashcraft> Connor_: I would think that $(this) is already handled by jquery optimally
[10:56:23] <mashcraft> so doing a bunch of refferences to $(this) vs myvar = $(this) should be about the same
[10:56:34] <Connor_> Fair enough
[10:57:24] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: still around or did you get busy
[11:00:57] <mashcraft> i guess so :(
[11:02:14] <Connor_> If I do .each(function() { setTimeout(someFunction(), someCalculatedTimeVariable); }); does the setTimeout keep running even though another setTimeout has been set pretty much instantly
[11:02:17] <Connor_> Example page
[11:02:22] <Connor_> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[11:02:31] <mashcraft> Connor_: it should
[11:02:33] <Connor_> View jquery.halfCarousel.js, line 68
[11:02:44] <mashcraft> if you dont want it keep making new ones
[11:02:59] <mashcraft> you can do myVar = setTimeout
[11:03:09] <Connor_> well, I want it to run regardless if another is running
[11:03:16] <Connor_> But atm they are all running at the same time
[11:03:34] <Connor_> And my calulcated timeout is correct
[11:03:37] <Connor_> Increases correctly etc
[11:04:01] <mashcraft> ok so is the issue maybe that they are all starting within a couple miliseconds of each other?
[11:04:13] <Connor_> I will console.log the intervals for you
[11:04:18] <mashcraft> k
[11:04:23] <Connor_> Wait they are already being console logged :P
[11:04:27] <DarsVaeda> I think the jquery-ui theme downloader is broken, I always get the same blue schemed theme
[11:04:34] <Connor_> 0, 150, 300, 450 etc
[11:04:56] <Connor_> Yet all run at 0 :(
[11:04:57] <mashcraft> Connor_: ok and can you give me a high level overview of what you want this to do ?
[11:05:16] <Connor_> I want the first to start, and then 150 milliseconds later the next one starts coming i
[11:05:26] <Connor_> On the link, you see 1 bag, but really its all the bags at the same time
[11:05:39] <Connor_> I want to have a slight delay between each one
[11:05:40] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: I'm coming and going
[11:05:52] <mashcraft> Connor_: ok on mine i get one bag and then another from the right that comes in and then leaves
[11:06:10] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: ok any chance I could get you to take a look at those selects please :)
[11:06:32] <Connor_> That 1 bag is all of them, which is the issue :P
[11:06:44] <Eviltwin> Connor_: Can you make a jsFiddle example?
[11:06:49] <enjoycrf> hai hai hai hai hai hai guyz
[11:06:52] <enjoycrf> help
[11:06:55] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: What's the deal with the selects?
[11:07:04] <Connor_> I shall try
[11:07:08] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: check out http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/
[11:07:09] <enjoycrf> ShowImages: function() {
[11:07:17] <enjoycrf> how do i get the function name
[11:07:27] <enjoycrf> inside a function
[11:07:37] <mashcraft> Connor_: any reason not to .animate and then on the done have the next one come in ?
[11:07:50] <Connor_> I want the next to come in while the previous is still animating
[11:08:03] <mashcraft> oh right on
[11:08:09] <enjoycrf> how do i get the function name inside a function
[11:08:19] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: You can't generally
[11:08:20] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[11:08:27] <enjoycrf> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[11:08:31] <enjoycrf> :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(
[11:08:38] <Eviltwin> Why would you need it?
[11:08:39] <enjoycrf> jumping out window
[11:08:45] <enjoycrf> bye every1
[11:09:01] <enjoycrf> cause i like to make everything dynamic
[11:09:07] <mashcraft> enjoycrf: pass the name to the function ?
[11:09:17] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: So why would you need the name?
[11:09:23] <Eviltwin> That sounds very static
[11:09:35] <enjoycrf> hmm maybe im overthinking it
[11:09:40] <mashcraft> Connor_: you know you have an error showing up right?
[11:09:47] <Eviltwin> arguments.callee is a handle to the function
[11:09:51] <Connor_> No error, it just runs them all at the same time
[11:09:56] <Eviltwin> Not the name
[11:10:01] <Connor_> Or, runs them all with an interval of 0
[11:10:02] <Eviltwin> But a reference to the function itself
[11:10:13] <mashcraft> Connor_: firebug gives me an error
[11:10:16] <mashcraft> on line 68
[11:10:16] <Connor_> Oh?
[11:10:21] <Connor_> What does it say
[11:10:21] <mashcraft> useless setTimeout call (missing quotes around argument?)
[11:11:19] <Connor_> Lol all sorts of broke in firefox :P
[11:11:23] <Connor_> Works okay in Chrome
[11:11:31] <ericlewis> i'm using the liscroller plugin, but for some reason when i call jQuery("ul#myscroller").liScroll(); it fails the javascript
[11:11:36] <ericlewis> annnny ideas?
[11:11:55] <mashcraft> Connor_: lol maybe thats why im not being of much help
[11:12:06] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: any thoughts on the selects?
[11:12:17] <mashcraft> only reason i keep asking is no one else seams to know :(
[11:12:28] <Connor_> Think it is calling an anonymous function inside the setTimeout
[11:12:38] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: I'm not getting any script errors
[11:12:54] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: no script errors just look at the label for make
[11:13:06] <mashcraft> after the page has loaded and its fetched the ajax
[11:13:28] <mashcraft> Connor_: yea works better in chrome
[11:13:44] <enjoycrf> ok another quastion
[11:14:34] <enjoycrf> i have a  function in onunload that runs $.post but the success is not executing
[11:14:45] <mashcraft> Connor_: where is interval coming from?
[11:14:58] <mashcraft> Connor_: never mind
[11:15:01] <Connor_> :)
[11:15:01] <mashcraft> im losing my mind
[11:15:21] <enjoycrf> its posting but the oncomplete code is not running
[11:15:46] <mashcraft> Connor_: one sec i have an idea
[11:15:51] <Connor_> Okay
[11:16:03] <whalesalad> hey guys. this is more of a general js question but figured someone could help. in a success() callback for an ajax call, if I put an alert() before calling some other code it works fine in IE, otherwise it fails
[11:16:23] <whalesalad> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/481230/
[11:16:38] <mashcraft> Connor_: ok this is iteresting i but a break point on setInterval on the doc ready
[11:16:40] <mashcraft> it never fires
[11:16:52] <Connor_> Wha
[11:16:53] <whalesalad> line 10 is the only thing making this work, so what is the root cause of soothing like this? if I put my self.handleVideoClips call into a setTimeout the same issue occurs so I don't think it's timing
[11:16:58] <Eviltwin> Connor_: http://jsfiddle.net/5VgCG/
[11:17:32] <Eviltwin> Sorry, gotta go
[11:17:36] <Eviltwin> I'll be back to help more later
[11:17:39] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: omg why did i not know about jsfiddle
[11:17:40] <Connor_> Okay thanks
[11:18:06] <mashcraft> nooo
[11:18:16] <mashcraft> crap ok now i need to figure out this select thing
[11:19:23] <ccmonster> c= 'ca'.toUpperCase(); map.c should equal map.CA right?
[11:19:38] <ccmonster> because console.log(map.CA) gives me what I want, but map.c does not
[11:20:41] <mashcraft> ccmonster: one sec
[11:20:48] <enapupe> Hi, how can I trigger a droppable event ?!
[11:21:09] <ccmonster> .trigger('droppable')
[11:21:25] <ccmonster> ?trigger @ enapupe
[11:21:25] <bot-t> enapupe, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:21:50] <UBB> Want free ZNC or counter-strike gathers, or free ventrilo channel? join irc.ubb.lt support in #help channel, don't hesitate to /q amex for free bnc or anything else you want
[11:21:53] <enapupe> ccmonster: but droppable depends on a draggable item
[11:22:00] <mashcraft> ccmonster: are you trying to dynamically creat a function name and then call the function?
[11:22:35] <ccmonster> not a function name
[11:22:37] <ccmonster> an object
[11:22:40] <ccmonster> i have a map obj
[11:22:44] <ccmonster> map.AE is a node
[11:23:32] <mashcraft> ok if your just doing it as a property of the map object you would want to do
[11:23:35] <bencc> is there a jquery based open source whiteboard ?
[11:23:39] <mashcraft> map.c = c;
[11:23:58] <mashcraft> or
[11:23:59] <chippy-> what plugin is the easiest one for creating a carousel with divs ? the "slides" im trying to do this to looks something like <div><img /><div>Desc</div></div>
[11:24:07] <mashcraft> map.c = 'ca'
[11:24:13] <mashcraft> map.c.toUpperCase();
[11:24:20] <mashcraft> i think that would work
[11:26:09] <ccmonster> well map.AE is already a node in a object
[11:26:17] <ccmonster> i just want to target it dynamically with map.myVar
[11:26:46] <ccmonster> however var myNewVar = myVar.toUpperCase(); map.myNewVar isn't targettin the node
[11:29:10] <ccmonster> make sense mashcraft ?
[11:29:43] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle is badassery at its finest
[11:30:43] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: What's wrong now?
[11:31:59] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: yay your back
[11:32:09] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: ok so go here http://villagecadillac.mobile.ptms-cms.com/inventory/
[11:32:19] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: watch the make and model selectors
[11:32:27] <mashcraft> and you will see my issue
[11:34:50] <Eviltwin> You mean the ones that default to "Any"?
[11:35:19] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: are they defaulting to any for you?
[11:35:34] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:35:41] <mashcraft> for me they are defaulting to a string of every element name with no spaces
[11:35:53] <Eviltwin> Let me try FF
[11:35:55] <mashcraft> select a make and tell me what happens to the model selector please
[11:36:03] <Eviltwin> Stays at Any
[11:36:05] <Eviltwin> Same for Model
[11:36:07] <Eviltwin> Not for Max Price
[11:36:11] <Eviltwin> Or the others
[11:36:48] <mashcraft> ok so im trying chrome now and it works ok. so in your firefox if you select a make of audi
[11:37:13] <mashcraft> it dosnt change to audi correct?
[11:37:35] <Eviltwin> Correct
[11:37:46] <Eviltwin> This is a jQuery UI select?
[11:37:59] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: jquery mobile select
[11:38:17] <Eviltwin> I think there's also a jQuery UI channel
[11:39:02] <mashcraft> well i can tryin there so far no one around in the jquery mobile channel
[11:40:07] <muzone> mashcraft: did that stuff ccmonster said make sense to you or not?
[11:40:30] <mashcraft> muzone: ill have to catch up in a few i got pulled out of the room to help some one
[11:42:41] <imsky> mmm  friday
[11:42:59] <Connor_> Mmm friday indeed
[11:44:12] <enjoycrf> ok guuyz im about to do the imposible
[11:44:13] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: Really not sure why this isn't working
[11:44:20] <Eviltwin> But I'm not a jQuery UI expert
[11:44:45] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: yea its a very odd issue that no one seems to have an answer too
[11:44:58] <enjoycrf> waats the issue
[11:45:20] <ccmonster> whats up Eviltwin ?
[11:45:29] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: Try ropping the selecteds
[11:45:29] <enjoycrf> ya wats up eviltwin?

[11:45:41] * geekbuntu *pokes head up*.... imsky?
[11:45:44] <Eviltwin> ccmonster, enjoycrf: Not my issue, it's mashcraft's
[11:45:57] <imsky> geekbuntu: hey man what's up
[11:46:05] <mashcraft> on that page the make and model selects wont show that you select any thing
[11:46:15] <geekbuntu> hey imsky!  just at work
[11:46:19] <mashcraft> and in my firefox it messes up the selects label on refresh
[11:46:21] <geekbuntu> peeped in to see who was around
[11:46:32] <geekbuntu> did you get through your project?
[11:46:46] <imsky> i did, i've been working my ass of on it
[11:46:50] <imsky> added rss and markdown
[11:46:52] <geekbuntu> cool!
[11:47:04] <geekbuntu> i'mi not a markdown fan but everybody else loves it
[11:47:05] <enjoycrf> u need to make ur own selects
[11:47:09] <imsky> i reinvented a php blogging engine for the 43605458235802'th time
[11:47:13] <enjoycrf> instead of using the browsers
[11:47:20] <geekbuntu> imsky, joint the club
[11:47:34] <TheRedOctober> greetings all.  Is there a problem with the tablesorter plugin?  on the jquery plugins page it doesn't render (it is renders just as a vanilla table) http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tablesorter/tablesorter, and I cant seem to get it to work locally
[11:47:35] <imsky> geekbuntu: it's a little wonky at first, but i'm really happy not to be storing xml in the db
[11:47:37] <mashcraft> enjoycrf: say what now? these are the jquery mobile selects
[11:47:47] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: The ones that are working have select="selected" on the Any
[11:47:51] <Eviltwin> aren't*
[11:47:56] <Eviltwin> The ones that are don't
[11:47:58] <Eviltwin> I'd start there
[11:48:00] <ccmonster> yea.
[11:48:03] <ccmonster> that's a dead ringer
[11:48:15] <enjoycrf> but what ur doing there should work
[11:48:29] <enjoycrf> i would make my own select boxes tho
[11:48:30] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: I added the selected="selected" on those items in a hope that it would fix them. let me remove it
[11:48:57] <ShaunR> i'm using windows.location with a get string, but now i want to pass some info that should not be in the browser bar, how can i do this but with post?
[11:49:27] <enjoycrf> just set the span.html to selected item
[11:50:14] <ccmonster> that, and that's odd how you are adding the ';' when you getSearchQueryString
[11:50:42] <TheRedOctober> Has anyone here make tablesorter work using stable?
[11:50:50] <ccmonster> dataTables
[11:51:01] <enjoycrf> ur modifying the crap out of select
[11:51:11] <enjoycrf> yet u expect it to work like it used to
[11:51:42] <enjoycrf> basicly ur only using the selects dropdown
[11:52:06] <enjoycrf> but ur replacing the closed select with ur span
[11:52:31] <ccmonster> yea, build your selects dynamically
[11:52:44] <TheRedOctober> ccmonster: roger, datatables, thx.
[11:52:47] <ccmonster> that way you can rebuild and mantain the reference easier
[11:52:49] <enjoycrf> so u need to span.html(select.selected)
[11:53:05] <enjoycrf> which would be a quick fix
[11:53:15] <enjoycrf> however i would just make my own selects altogethers
[11:53:35] <ccmonster> i second that
[11:53:36] <enjoycrf> so the dropdown box matches the look of the top box
[11:53:54] <enjoycrf> its a lot of work
[11:53:55] <enjoycrf> but
[11:54:09] <enjoycrf> ur asking for it
[11:54:11] <enjoycrf> lol
[11:55:21] <ccmonster> hah
[11:56:04] <enjoycrf> hah
[11:56:25] <enjoycrf> i am ccmonster from paralel universe
[11:56:29] <enjoycrf> helo
[11:58:03] <jcrawford-home> Connor_: thanks again and sorry to bombard your inbox this morning lol
[11:58:17] <Connor_> Hey, no problem :P
[11:58:31] <Eviltwin> mashcraft: Line 89, you have the true outside of the parens
[11:58:32] <jcrawford-home> i also alerted the developer so he can update his release code
[11:58:38] <Eviltwin> 59*
[11:58:47] <Connor_> The code is really bad tbh in that plugin
[11:58:48] <Connor_> :P
[11:58:53] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: checking now
[11:59:20] <jcrawford-home> lol i need to learn more because i was able to follow it haha
[11:59:38] <jcrawford-home> i plan to look through some other plugins too so i may clean this one up once i learn more about them :)
[12:00:09] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: updated
[12:00:12] <Dreamstar> Iam the KING
[12:00:29] <enjoycrf> i jus microwaved my cofe
[12:00:49] <mashcraft> Eviltwin: didnt fix it
[12:00:50] <mashcraft> :(
[12:00:54] <mashcraft> man this thing sucks
[12:00:58] <Connor_> I have started working on one, ill pm you the link
[12:01:01] <mashcraft> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2410#issuecomment-2056494
[12:01:01] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2410 on jquery-mobile, reported by philhaeusler (2w, 4h ago): b3 selectmenu does not refresh properly in PhoneGap iOS
[12:01:24] <enjoycrf> sleep(10000000000000);
[12:01:31] <enjoycrf> that should fix it
[12:03:42] <imsky> :(
[12:03:44] <imsky> y u hate user
[12:04:37] <enjoycrf> return;
[12:04:59] <imsky> y u hate developer
[12:05:20] <enjoycrf> <div class="clear"></div>
[12:05:31] <imsky> y u hate standards
[12:05:39] <enjoycrf> :/
[12:05:47] <imsky> just a ball of hate
[12:05:56] <enjoycrf> i cant deside
[12:06:07] <enjoycrf> if i wana place the tabs on top of my popup
[12:06:11] <enjoycrf> or inside the popup
[12:06:23] <imsky> how about neither
[12:06:33] <enjoycrf> ?
[12:06:49] <imsky> you got tabs in a popup
[12:06:57] <enjoycrf> u sum kind of imp
[12:07:00] <imsky> somewhere your ui just decided to fuck it
[12:07:12] <imsky> i'm an implementation
[12:07:47] <enjoycrf> i actually build stuff instead of jus downloading random plugins
[12:07:55] <enjoycrf> and then not knowing how to use them lol
[12:08:05] <imsky> who are you directing that random plugins line to
[12:08:14] <enjoycrf> ppl who do that
[12:08:22] <imsky> 0_o
[12:08:24] <enjoycrf> i do use legit plugins tho
[12:08:38] <imsky> i didn't know we had illegit plugins
[12:08:41] <erichynds> this conversation is the best
[12:08:52] <imsky> u ruined it
[12:08:54] <enjoycrf> join it
[12:08:56] <imsky> y u hate conversation
[12:08:57] <erichynds> :|
[12:08:59] <enjoycrf> no shut up sky
[12:09:00] <ajpiano> erichynds: i was thinking the same thing
[12:09:06] <enjoycrf> dun lisen to him
[12:09:26] <imsky> ya im not wat is that shit
[12:10:33] <enjoycrf> ok i have tabs that wil control the content inside popup
[12:10:41] <imsky> it sounds like you're failing
[12:10:46] <imsky> would you like some assistance?
[12:10:57] <enjoycrf> should i put them on top of popup or inside popup
[12:11:59] <KeepSafe> Is it possible to update teh contents of a div based on a streaming get request?
[12:12:00] <enjoycrf> see its hard isnt it
[12:12:07] <imsky> whats hard
[12:12:16] <enjoycrf> decisions are hard
[12:12:21] <imsky> life is hard
[12:12:31] <enjoycrf> stay on topic
[12:12:45] <imsky> i'm stayin, you're strayin
[12:12:48] <minijupe> why does     $("#menu ul")[0].addClass('dropdown') produce this error: Object #<HTMLUListElement> has no method 'addClass'
[12:13:06] <imsky> minijupe: because you're referencing the DOM element, not the jquery object
[12:13:08] <imsky> duhh
[12:13:37] <minijupe> imsky: i don't use much jquery. i only want the first ul, not any others
[12:13:45] <imsky> minijupe: today is your lucky day
[12:13:54] <imsky> $("menu ul:first").addClass("dropdown")
[12:14:27] <minijupe> imsky: what if I wanted the 5th one?
[12:14:35] <imsky> minijupe: oh man you're in luck
[12:14:42] <imsky> $("menu ul:eq(4)")
[12:14:59] <D_yne> or $('menu ul')[4] ?
[12:15:04] <imsky> NOAP
[12:15:14] <sphinxxx> can you not use variables in localStorage ?
[12:15:21] <sphinxxx> like localStorage[id] = "test';
[12:15:29] <minijupe> imsky: i'm with D_yne I don't understand why the [x] doesn't work
[12:15:35] <imsky> sphinxxx: this is def not the channel for that garbage, take it to #javascript or #html5
[12:15:46] <Connor_> [x] returns a pure html dom element
[12:15:51] <Connor_> Not a jquery element
[12:15:56] <D_yne> okay :)
[12:15:56] <imsky> minijupe: because the [x] references the xth item in the dom element array that jquery's referencing
[12:16:18] <imsky> if you'd like to know more, plz 2 read the jquery api
[12:16:19] <Connor_> You can also do .index(x) with the same effect and will be a jquery object
[12:16:25] <imsky> Connor_: .get()
[12:16:28] <imsky> not index
[12:16:32] <Connor_> index works
[12:16:36] <imsky> those bastards
[12:16:37] <minijupe> i think I'm probably used to how prototype extends the dom. i don' t hardly do much JS. Doesn't $("#mycss") return an array?
[12:16:42] <imsky> they make everything even more convenient
[12:16:52] <imsky> minijupe: yes
[12:17:05] <enjoycrf> ok im puting my tabs on top of popup
[12:17:10] <enjoycrf> its gona look sick
[12:17:11] <Connor_> (Note, as its a ID it will only return 1 element)
[12:17:27] <imsky> lolol
[12:19:25] <minijupe> Connor_: imsky: .index() and .get() both produce the same error.
[12:19:35] <imsky> minijupe: index isn't meant for that shit
[12:19:40] <imsky> minijupe: what error are you getting though
[12:19:45] <Connor_> Index is meant for that shit
[12:19:50] <minijupe> Object #<HTMLUListElement> has no method 'addClass
[12:19:52] <imsky> noap
[12:19:56] <imsky> minijupe: i thought i told you bro
[12:19:58] <imsky> ul:first
[12:20:02] <imsky> don't use .get()
[12:20:07] <imsky> it's all in the selector
[12:20:09] <minijupe> imsky: you're right, I'll try this: $("menu ul:eq(4)")
[12:20:14] <minijupe> but that is ugly shit
[12:20:17] <imsky> minijupe: that should work too
[12:20:24] <imsky> minijupe: it's css-style selectors
[12:20:37] <minijupe> i prefer programming-style programming : )
[12:20:43] <imsky> hmmm
[12:20:47] <D_yne> lolz
[12:20:50] <imsky> i'm not the one with errors out my ass, minijupe
[12:20:57] <minijupe> imsky: lol
[12:22:53] <Connor_> Sorry I was wrong last time, its actually .eq()
[12:23:02] <imsky> you bet your ass you were
[12:23:33] <Connor_> Also, doing $('.something ul:eq(4)') is a longer way around doing .eq(4);
[12:23:44] <imsky> not any longer
[12:23:50] <imsky> maybe slower, have to check that
[12:24:21] <minijupe> Connor_: what are you saying is a better alternative?
[12:24:43] <Connor_> If you want to select an element based on the index
[12:24:47] <Connor_> Then use .eq
[12:24:53] <ccmonster> eq(3) etc
[12:24:59] <erichynds> yeah, :eq is much slower compared to .eq()
[12:25:02] <Connor_> If you want the first (and don't care about IE6) use :first-child
[12:25:07] <Connor_> Which is a pure CSS selector
[12:25:14] <ccmonster> or, to get a set , $('#id li).slice()
[12:25:19] <imsky> erichynds: probably, though if you're not doing it over and over again, who cares
[12:25:21] <ccmonster> a subset that is
[12:25:27] <jmar777> Connor_: :first-child will work in IE6 (just now through querySelectorAll)
[12:25:35] <erichynds> imsky: why do anything?
[12:25:50] <Connor_> Oh, nice didn't know that
[12:25:55] <jmar777> Connor_: sp/now/not
[12:26:02] <imsky> erichynds: because it gets me paid, son
[12:26:08] <erichynds> imsky: truth!
[12:26:29] <Connor_> If possible don't mess with the selector
[12:26:29] <minijupe> Connor_: that's a bit ambiguous at this point:  do you mean  $('.something ul:eq(4)')  $('.something').eq(4) ?
[12:26:34] <minijupe> which one?
[12:26:41] <Connor_> $('.something').eq(4)
[12:26:47] <Connor_> Will get the 5th element
[12:26:59] <Connor_> Use that
[12:27:13] <Connor_> If it dosen't work then there is another issue
[12:27:46] <imsky> :eq is 73% slower
[12:27:50] <imsky> thanks jsperf
[12:28:16] <imsky> Connor_: no it won't
[12:28:25] <imsky> back to selector school with you
[12:28:36] <Connor_> What won't what
[12:28:43] <mashcraft> Connor_: i got the select to fix by going back to b2 rather than using b3
[12:29:05] <imsky> $('.something').eq(5) won't get the 6th UL, which is what minijupe wants
[12:29:25] <imsky> minijupe: are you feeling confused and exhausted from all this bullshit?
[12:29:32] <minijupe> imsky: nope
[12:29:40] <Connor_> Why wouldn't it get the 6th UL?
[12:29:43] <imsky> oh lawd
[12:29:55] <minijupe> I just find jquery a little wonky
[12:30:04] <minijupe> but that's just me
[12:30:31] <minijupe> maybe I should read the docs again : )
[12:30:35] <minijupe> it's been a while
[12:31:04] <minijupe> but not to start a flame war, I find prototype much more intuitive, maybe because I'm a RoR guy
[12:31:28] <imsky> minijupe: prototype is dead, jquery is way superior to it
[12:31:36] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/nmqs7/
[12:31:42] <Connor_> Works for me @imsky
[12:31:42] <imsky> if you like the prototype approach, go with mootools or something
[12:31:55] <imsky> Connor_: that's not what i meant
[12:32:01] <Askraba> Hello from Stuttgart :)
[12:32:07] <imsky> hello from the internets
[12:32:13] <Askraba> :)
[12:32:28] <Connor_> What did you mean then :/
[12:32:32] <minijupe> imsky: people DO seem to prefer jquery. how exactly is it superior?
[12:32:33] <imsky> bro.
[12:32:55] <imsky> minijupe: hmm depends on how you define superior, i think some guy wrote a mootools vs jquery thing a while back that outlined all points
[12:33:08] <imsky> minijupe: it's a really fast and convenient DOM library, more convenient than any other
[12:33:23] <imsky> minijupe: projects i work on with Ruby guys are littered with prototype crap and it just looks ugly and hackish
[12:33:40] <magcius> How would you guys go about sorting an arbitrary set of <div>s based on some criteria?
[12:33:49] <imsky> magcius: what are the criteria
[12:33:52] <magcius> classname
[12:34:25] <imsky> so you probably want something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/929519/dynamically-arranging-divs-using-jquery/929607#929607
[12:34:26] <minijupe> imsky: does jquery offer class construction?
[12:34:27] <magcius> implement quicksort, but change the swap method to swap the <div>s?
[12:34:38] <imsky> minijupe: should it have to?
[12:35:03] <magcius> Oh, that's a clever solution.
[12:35:05] <Askraba> I have an question. Can you please look at here: http://shoppica.net/Electronics   Do somebody now something about this effect. On mouseover the other elements goes down with the opacityâ€¦do somebody now something about this function?..thank you so muchâ€¦ >>>>Sorry if I disturb
[12:35:08] <minijupe> imsky: I'll take that as a no : )
[12:35:30] <imsky> minijupe: it's a DOM library, not a javascript overhaul
[12:36:19] <minijupe> imsky: i'm not really partisan here. just looking for reasons jquery is better than prototype. I
[12:36:47] <ciss> hi! for versions < 1.4, is there an alternative for using .filter() with a jquery object?
[12:36:56] <imsky> minijupe: hopefully this can adjust your attitude http://www.google.com/trends?q=prototype+js%2C+jquery+js
[12:37:11] <minijupe> imsky: *not partisan*
[12:37:32] <ciss> (read: with a jquery object as argument)
[12:37:35] <imsky> so why say jquery is wonky?
[12:38:16] <ajpiano> minijupe: jquery is a much better supported project in the present tenese... it has an extensible paradigm and a unified interface to calling methods on groups of elements
[12:38:30] <ajpiano> instead of prototypes whole Effect.whatever("whatever") etc
[12:39:25] <ajpiano> ciss: .filter(function( obj ) {  return obj.filter( this ).length  }) ?
[12:39:54] <minijupe> ajpiano: I don't do enough JS to really feel one way or the other. Mostly because working with JS is immensely frustrating. It's obvious that the world prefers jquery these days.
[12:40:01] <ajpiano> right
[12:40:13] <ajpiano> minijupe: jquery helps you obfuscate the ugly parts of cross-browser stuff
[12:40:21] <imsky> ^ that's the best part
[12:40:22] <ajpiano> which will help you wrap your head around "the way javascript works"
[12:40:29] <imsky> i don't even think about that anymore
[12:40:31] <ajpiano> as you'll be much more focused on actually writing apps and improving the way you do that
[12:40:40] <imsky> but with other libraries, shit breaks all the time browser to browser
[12:41:15] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Wasn't the filter by element also added in 1.4?
[12:41:42] <ajpiano> very well may have been
[12:41:45] <Askraba> maybe someone knows something about that: http://shoppica.net/Electronics   :)
[12:41:47] <ajpiano> i don't remember
[12:41:55] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I just looked at the API
[12:42:35] <ajpiano> i guess .filter(function( obj ) { var el = this; return obj.filter( function() { return el == this; }); ).length  })
[12:42:36] <ajpiano> lol
[12:42:40] <ajpiano> ther'es probably a better way
[12:42:47] <imsky> el == this, ajpiano?
[12:42:47] <ajpiano> that is grosssssss
[12:42:51] <imsky> you coercive fucker
[12:43:17] <kanja1> I'm trying to redo some old code that used handleError - should I be looking at .error() as a replacement?
[12:43:24] <enjoycrf> dood how come imsky is not getting banned
[12:43:34] <enjoycrf> if it was me id be so banned already
[12:43:41] <ajpiano> imsky: you can feel free to actually give people code samples instead of prattling on endlessly
[12:43:44] <ajpiano> :p
[12:43:50] <ccmonster> :)
[12:44:20] <imsky> ajpiano: i'm in jquery source right now looking at the .filter function
[12:44:30] <ajpiano> good job
[12:44:30] <imsky> when i have something
[12:44:33] <imsky> i'll let you know
[12:45:18] * geekbuntu imskysaid fucker
[12:45:21] * geekbuntu o.0
[12:45:35] <imsky> lol
[12:45:39] <ajpiano> in case no one has been paying attention for the last 3 years we don't just ban you cause you say a bad word
[12:46:14] <ajpiano> ... within reason :)
[12:46:36] * geekbuntu *holds up sign*  This message was brought to you by ajpiano
[12:46:54] <Eviltwin> Someone doesn't understand /ME ...
[12:47:40] <webPragmatist> I have another script that uses document.getElementByID().doPlay() how can i call this inside of a jquery callback?
[12:48:07] <ajpiano> by putting it there
[12:48:16] <webPragmatist> hrm i tried that...
[12:48:25] <ccmonster> lol
[12:50:16] <webPragmatist> Id...
[12:51:39] <amid_hasan> Hey guys! I'm loading some data view $('#div').load('remotepagedata.php'); using click, how do I attach an ajax-loader after the click but remove it before the data loads?
[12:52:14] <imsky> the .filter implementation is some sneaky js
[12:54:20] <imsky> and defined twice 0_o
[12:56:35] <enjoycrf> i was in javascript and i got banned because i said javascript was primitive lol
[12:56:58] <imsky> hmm
[12:57:02] <imsky> i think that was justified
[12:57:12] <enjoycrf> cant hear you
[12:57:28] <imsky> well obviously, because i'm not speaking into your ear
[12:58:21] <Yoofie> anyone want to help a JS noob solve a jquery show/hide problem?
[12:58:41] <Yoofie> http://jsfiddle.net/J7NJ7/
[12:59:38] <ciss> ajpiano, imsky: gross or not, but el == this was the right direction: http://jsfiddle.net/UaTew/
[12:59:48] <ciss> thanks for your help :)
[12:59:54] <imsky> glad it worked out for ya bud
[13:00:30] <ajpiano> ciss:  you could probably duckpunch that onto $.fn.filter
[13:01:03] <ciss> ajpiano: currently not worth the effort, i only need in a single place
[13:01:17] <ajpiano> this way you can just pass jqueries to filter and it will just work
[13:01:31] <imsky> hold on playas
[13:01:34] <imsky> i'm onto something
[13:01:41] <ajpiano> yah i guess, this way it's def coded in a super brittle way :)
[13:01:47] * ajpiano grasps imsky
[13:01:55] * imsky wiggles
[13:02:02] <imsky> IM FREE I TELLS YA
[13:02:40] <nail_> Yoofie: http://jsfiddle.net/J7NJ7/1/
[13:05:02] <Yoofie> nail_: Thanks! I knew it was something simple
[13:05:23] <imsky> ok ajpiano
[13:05:26] <imsky> i finally dug around
[13:05:40] <imsky> and this is what filter boils down to for a set of elements larger than 1
[13:05:58] <imsky> jQuery.find.matches("div:odd",$("div"))
[13:06:05] <imsky> pretty amazing i know
[13:08:14] <imsky> so ciss, that works with 1.3.2
[13:19:01] <randallb> hey how do I focus on a form element programatically?
[13:19:15] <imsky> .focus()
[13:19:18] <randallb> ie someone clicks a button, a bunch of stuff happens, then I want to shit focus to an input field
[13:19:25] <randallb> ahh or trigger
[13:19:34] <randallb> i just read the "bind an event" part on the docs
[13:19:35] <randallb> thx
[13:25:35] <kinga> hey guys, is this piece of code good ? CurrentState = $('#helper'+helper_id).children('td')[1].text();
[13:25:52] <imsky> does it work?
[13:25:52] <kinga> it gives me the error Object #<HTMLTableCellElement> has no method 'text'
[13:25:56] <imsky> lol
[13:25:59] <imsky> jesus christ
[13:26:07] <imsky> two of these in one irc session
[13:26:34] <eddiemonge> kinga: thats because you are trying to call .text on a dom element and not a jquery object
[13:26:38] <imsky> kinga: $("#helper"+helper_id).children('td').first().text()
[13:26:43] <eddiemonge> ?get @ kinga
[13:26:44] <bot-t> kinga, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:26:44] <kinga> ok. i was expecting that
[13:26:47] <imsky> er not .first
[13:26:49] <eddiemonge> oops not get
[13:26:49] <imsky> .eq(1)
[13:26:57] <kinga> imsky, i don't want first element, but second
[13:26:57] <eddiemonge> what imsky said ^^^
[13:27:03] <imsky> kinga, corrected myself
[13:27:22] <kinga> ok
[13:27:32] <rogeruiz> hey
[13:27:59] <rogeruiz> quick question regarding jquery ui IE8 datepicker functionality
[13:28:04] <rogeruiz> I'm getting this weird loop
[13:28:31] <kinga> now it says Object  has not method text
[13:28:31] <rogeruiz> where the previous button is behaving like the next button
[13:28:40] <kinga> notice the double <space>s
[13:29:06] <imsky> kinga: you're doing something wrong
[13:29:22] <kinga> is there a conv function from dom to jquery and vice-versa
[13:29:23] <kinga> ?
[13:30:28] <Hooloovoo> kinga: eh? you mean $()?
[13:30:29] * jedimind blinks
[13:30:38] <rogeruiz> any suggestions?
[13:30:43] <kinga> yea
[13:31:02] <kinga> $('selector') converted into an array of dom objects
[13:31:04] <Hooloovoo> kinga: well, there is $(). just put a dom element in there and voila!
[13:31:20] <eddiemonge> kinga: try pasting your code at jsfiddle
[13:31:26] <Haprog> kinga: $(dom), jqobj[0]
[13:32:09] <Haprog> $('selector');
[13:32:14] <Haprog> $('selector').toArray();
[13:32:14] <ciss> imsky: unfortunately i'm on 1.2.6 - but yeah, that's pretty amazing ;)
[13:32:15] <kinga> oh damn... drinking even 1 beer is bad for me while working
[13:32:27] <kinga> thanks for the help guys, but i think i'll pass for tonight
[13:35:25] <imsky> ciss: 1.2.6 eh? why didn't you say so!
[13:36:11] <kinga> oh, i discovered my problem :)
[13:36:28] <kinga> i had another call to the method text() on the variable of type string
[13:36:54] <kinga> i was trying to debug and forgot to remove that line
[13:37:08] <rogeruiz> the date picker in the latest query ui is throwing a weird but in IE8 where the previous button is making the calendar dates go forward instead of backwards
[13:37:20] <Dreamstar> How can I post with jQuery then update a div?
[13:37:45] <ciss> imsky: it was too embarrassing
[13:37:52] <Dreamstar> Have like this atm: https://pastee.org/nrkhx
[13:37:55] <imsky> i'd be hiding that too, ciss
[13:38:01] <ciss> i tried
[13:38:11] <imsky> that's 3 years of effort
[13:38:14] <imsky> gone
[13:38:26] <ciss> i notice that about every 20 minutes
[13:38:37] <imsky> ciss: 1.2.6 has .filter thouhg
[13:38:52] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: like that
[13:39:10] <ciss> imsky: yep, but not for jquery objects or dom elements. the fiddle code works fine
[13:39:17] <imsky> oh right
[13:39:19] <ciss> +though
[13:39:30] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: your term selector should be 'input[name="poll"]:checked'
[13:40:43] <ciss> btw, any way to modify a collection directly? currently i have to do: elems = elems.add(target)
[13:42:41] <imsky> ciss, got your filter right here
[13:42:53] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: Alright, I have it like that?
[13:43:17] <imsky> ciss, $($.multiFilter(":odd",$("div")))
[13:43:24] <imsky> 1.2.6 tested :D
[13:43:58] <imsky> ciss: http://jsfiddle.net/xLMWG/1/
[13:44:31] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: if that code isnt working there might be something else going on
[13:45:24] <Dreamstar> I get this warning in firebug
[13:45:26] <Dreamstar> Empty string sent to getElementById ().
[13:45:26] <Dreamstar> The use of getAttributeNodeNS () is obsolete. Use getAttributeNS () instead.
[13:45:48] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: from what?
[13:46:39] <ciss> imsky: i'm guessing the first argument *has* to be a selector string?
[13:46:51] <Dreamstar> I get Empty string when I'm on the page
[13:46:52] <imsky> yeah, but you know what
[13:46:59] <imsky> i just ran .filter on 1.2.6 and it worked well too
[13:47:28] <Dreamstar> The use of getAttributeNodeNS () disappears when i submit
[13:47:40] <ciss> imsky: i know that it does, just not for dom and jq objects: http://jsfiddle.net/UaTew/
[13:47:59] <Dreamstar> otherwise, it is always there
[13:48:20] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: what is being returned?
[13:48:25] <eddiemonge> and a live link would help
[13:48:58] <ciss> imsky: get yer errors while they're warm: http://jsfiddle.net/XND2h/ ;)
[13:49:26] <imsky> righto
[13:51:55] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: One weird question
[13:52:14] <Dreamstar> I have to have the form like this? <form action="#" id="pollForm">
[13:52:21] <Dreamstar> but I want a post action
[13:52:49] <imsky> ciss:
[13:52:49] <imsky> var result1 = $($.multiFilter("#id-1",$("li"))).size()
[13:53:03] <imsky> looks like it returns what you want, but i guess i gotta figure out the jquery obj stuff
[13:53:23] <rogeruiz> i'm having a very strange bug with the ui datepicker. the previous button in the calendar is making the calendar go forward in IE8
[13:53:32] <rogeruiz> any suggestions as to what is happening there?
[13:53:36] <mangOskittle> HALP. I have a bit of JS that on page load is grabbing a param in the page query string and setting it to a var. But the query string can have some international characters, like Ã¼, and the js is immediately replacing it wtih "Ã£Â¼" instead
[13:54:19] <ciss> imsky: i realize this might an exciting challenge and i'm thankful for your efforts, but the current solution works well, while still being readable
[13:54:35] <imsky> ciss: haha i know, glad it works for ya :D
[13:57:14] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: huh? you want a post action? you mean like method="post" ?
[13:57:34] <Dreamstar> Yea, now it just get it
[13:57:56] <Dreamstar> I want some data into a database
[13:58:17] <Dreamstar> when the data is there, refresh the div
[13:58:37] <zanberdo> I'm having trouble with how ie renders a jquery ui dialog. Specifically IE appears to ignore the height property. Anyone have any ideas on why that might be?
[13:59:25] <zanberdo> I'm testing both IE 8 and IE 9 and both appear to completely ignore the height property.
[14:00:53] <savid> Is anyone here using the jquery.tmpl plugin?   I'm getting this strange error in chrome:  http://i.imgur.com/T5rpP.png
[14:01:51] <Hooloovoo> is the jquery.tmpl plugin stable?
[14:03:54] <savid> Hooloovoo, I'm not sure if it is in jquery codebase, but I'm using the external plugin
[14:04:40] <enjoycrf> hey how do i trim w jquery
[14:05:00] <savid> Hooloovoo,  it's been working fine, and I think it's just now broken with a chrome update.
[14:06:57] <rogeruiz> hey all
[14:06:59] <Hooloovoo> savid: Ahh, cool. Gotta try it out some time. Don't know anything about it so i can't help out =(
[14:07:06] <Hooloovoo> rogeruiz: o/
[14:07:14] <rogeruiz> I need help with a ui date picker bug in IE8
[14:07:26] <rogeruiz> the previous button is being mapped to the next button
[14:07:40] <rogeruiz> so the calendar keeps moving forward instead of backwards
[14:07:49] <rogeruiz> this is only happening in IE8
[14:09:34] <hye> hi
[14:09:47] <enjoycrf> haaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiii
[14:09:53] <hye> what is a nice jquery extension I can use, to have an image come out like the way genie comes out of a magic lamp?
[14:09:56] <rogeruiz> any suggestions what might be happening?
[14:10:24] <mangOskittle> Can someone help me deal with some international characters? I'm grabbing a query string param for a var, but for example the character Ã¼ is immediately replaced by ÃƒÂ¼
[14:11:48] <sparuvu> how can I make sure that my scripts are loaded after the dom is loaded via jQuery templates?
[14:19:22] <enjoycrf> ok great every1 leave
[14:19:34] <Dreamstar> ;:D
[14:19:51] <rogeruiz> okay
[14:19:55] <rogeruiz> I fixed it
[14:20:00] <rogeruiz> if anyone is curious
[14:20:10] <sparuvu> how can I make sure that my scripts are loaded after the dom is loaded via jQuery templates?
[14:20:53] <johnernaut> $(document).ready();
[14:23:44] <Elephant> :O a wild mini-jupe appeared
[14:27:29] <sparuvu> johnernaut that wont work as I am loading the DOM dynamically using jQuery templates
[14:27:35] <|RicharD|> hi to all
[14:27:39] <sparuvu> isthere any other way ?
[14:30:25] <enjoycrf> my friends
[14:30:35] <enjoycrf> hey
[14:32:52] <enjoycrf> brocly rules!
[14:37:04] <necromancer> has anyone here had problems with facebox on IE6?
[14:37:21] <necromancer> by loading the JS file i get a "Operation not permitted" error and my page crashes
[14:39:11] <Elephant> ie6
[14:39:22] <Elephant> wow, I'll have to grab me a copy of that.
[14:39:39] <Hooloovoo> necromancer: do yourself a favor, drop IE6 support.
[14:40:21] <necromancer> Hooloovoo: do yourself a favor, don't tell me how to code
[14:40:22] <necromancer> ;)
[14:40:39] <necromancer> everything works basically just facebox's JS is strange
[14:41:04] <necromancer> OH MAYBE THIS IS WHY!?!??!?
[14:41:05] <necromancer>     if ($(this).length == 0) return
[14:41:05] <necromancer>     init(settings)
[14:41:07] <necromancer> what the FUCK
[14:41:13] <necromancer> there are NO semicolons in this file...
[14:42:43] <savid> Figured it out.  You can't have a template variable with the name "class":   http://jsfiddle.net/savid/Cu88v/
[14:50:01] <riyonuk> Figure this would be the best place to ask this. I have a simple, 5 page website. I'm trying to find a solution, where when I press the left and right arrow keys, the next page loads (the content on screen fades out, and the new content fades in). Is that a jQuery thing?
[14:54:56] <ahandy> how would i go abotu stopping a function? in php it's either die(), exit() or just return false
[14:56:17] <michaeldeol> @ahandy return should work
[14:56:25] <ahandy> michaeldeol: just: return false; ?
[14:56:44] <michaeldeol> correct
[14:56:49] <ahandy> hm
[14:56:58] <ahandy> i did that and it didn't work, must be something wrong with the rest of the code
[14:57:22] <ahandy> michaeldeol: if $next = $("element"); and $last = $("element");, would if($next == $last) return true?
[14:57:22] <michaeldeol> sounds like you may not be reaching the return in the code then
[14:57:26] <enjoycrf> BROCOLI
[14:57:31] <enjoycrf> !
[15:00:49] <StPiere> can i iterate through 2 DOMS el1 and el2 like this : $(el1, el2).each(function() {..}) ??
[15:01:55] <ciss> riyonuk: i guess you mean like on github?
[15:02:13] <riyonuk> ciss: Yeah!
[15:02:38] <ciss> riyonuk: the url not changing is a html5 thing, the rest is jquery
[15:02:54] <|RicharD|> hi anyone know why http://studio.quarantastudio.it/contact
[15:03:06] <|RicharD|> not apply the class to the parent li element in menu ?
[15:03:13] <ciss> riyonuk: http://spoiledmilk.dk/blog/html5-changing-the-browser-url-without-refreshing-page
[15:03:19] <|RicharD|> i do this: $('#navmenu li a[href="/' + path + '"]').parent().addClass('select-bottom');
[15:03:37] <riyonuk> ciss: Actually, I want the URL to change.
[15:03:49] <FiSHNUGGET> Is there a way to bind an event listener to an input field that has been completed using Autofill?
[15:03:54] <ciss> riyonuk: thats why i gave you the link
[15:04:13] <michaeldeol> @StPiere appears to work
[15:04:32] <StPiere> thanks
[15:06:43] <enjoycrf> how do i get the first div2 in div1
[15:07:10] <FNTom> div1 and div2 are IDs?
[15:07:26] <|RicharD|> nobody can help with my problem ?
[15:07:27] <FNTom> Or you want the first div inside another div?
[15:07:50] <enjoycrf> sory beat u guys
[15:07:51] <enjoycrf> :first
[15:07:53] <enjoycrf> lol
[15:08:03] <FNTom> Yeah
[15:08:23] <FNTom> RicharD, parent() has always had weird outcomes for me and I'm not sure why.
[15:08:32] <michaeldeol> @|RicharD| what happens when you console.log $('#navmenu li a[href="/' + path + '"]')
[15:08:44] <michaeldeol> is the path actually being built out?
[15:08:55] <|RicharD|> now i try
[15:09:25] <|RicharD|> i ha
[15:09:29] <|RicharD|> had*
[15:09:30] <|RicharD|> fixed
[15:09:32] <|RicharD|> -.-
[15:09:36] <|RicharD|> stupid my error...thx a lot man
[15:09:41] <michaeldeol> np
[15:10:48] <FNTom> Anybody in here interested in MIT licensed Gantt jquery UI graph?
[15:11:17] <FiSHNUGGET> Is there a way to bind an event listener to an input field that has been completed using Autofill?
[15:11:24] <FiSHNUGGET> whoops - sorry to repeat
[15:12:03] <ciss> FNTom: what's the catch? :)
[15:12:27] <FNTom> No catch, looking for a couple of people to test it (should have it up on Github this weekend)
[15:12:59] <ciss> light-weight gantt is always nice
[15:13:11] <FNTom> How lightweight are you thinking? Hah
[15:13:35] <FNTom> It auto-resizes date range on drop / drag or resize. Zoom in / out, grouped moving of tasks etc
[15:13:36] <ciss> FNTom: 10kb should suffice :P
[15:13:44] <FNTom> Minified it should be about 10kb ;)
[15:13:48] <ciss> FNTom: cool
[15:14:11] <ciss> FNTom: got a link to your github so i can save it somewhere?
[15:14:33] <FNTom> I don't have a github account yet, this is my first OOS project :P
[15:14:38] <FNTom> OSS*
[15:17:05] <ciss> FNTom: shouldnt you be looking for testers once there's actually something to test?
[15:17:41] <FNTom> There's very few things left to patch up on it to push it out the door :P
[15:18:08] <FNTom> But it's going up this weekend for sure
[15:18:34] <ciss> hm-hm
[15:19:56] <FNTom> A nay-sayer! I'll try get it up tonight.
[15:20:49] <ciss> :)
[15:21:25] <ajpiano> FNTom: send it to me too,
[15:22:51] <ceasarbautista> hey
[15:22:53] <freedrull> is there an event for when 'ok' is clicked in a confirm box, or do you just have to check the result
[15:23:16] <LakWork_> freedrull check the result
[15:23:19] <LakWork_> true/false
[15:23:34] <FNTom> ajpiano, will do!
[15:24:09] <freedrull> LakWork_: ok
[15:26:16] <laidback_01> hello, I'm using jquery with the standard tabs.   It's running on top of a css grid, which is the front end for a Catalyst app.  I use TT a lot too.  my issue is caching.  When I use jqgrid to display tabular data, the author of that code has taken pains to make sure the data is not cached.  However, I can't work out how to accomplish this task.  Can someone provide an example?  I'm attempting to use the API, but have been unsuccessful with my
[15:26:17] <laidback_01> feeble attempts.
[15:26:38] <ceasarbautista> so i'm a newbie when it comes to ajax stuff. can someone basically explain to me what the best way to implement something where I pull two images out of a db and then let people pick which want they like more?
[15:27:05] <ceasarbautista> does it make sense to like, pull 20 images and then show /hide things as people click through?
[15:27:13] <ceasarbautista> or is there a better way to do it?
[15:27:51] <gnarf> well, every query takes time
[15:28:04] <gnarf> so if pulling 20 options takes the same amount of time as pulling 2 options
[15:28:11] <gnarf> it might be metter to pull 20 and sit on them
[15:28:44] <ceasarbautista> i guess that just comes down to testing then.
[15:29:01] <ceasarbautista> what if I say wanted to stop the user after 20 hits and like, reward them?
[15:29:16] <ceasarbautista> how would I keep track of the number of trials completed?
[15:29:44] <gnarf> .... with a variable?
[15:30:00] <gnarf> server side or client side?
[15:30:19] <ceasarbautista> i guess i was thinking client side
[15:30:25] <gnarf> your asking such broad design questions its really hard to give you an exact answer...
[15:30:31] <ceasarbautista> yeah, apologies
[15:30:35] <gnarf> client side - its just some var that counts
[15:30:52] <ceasarbautista> that makes sense
[15:30:59] <gnarf> but then you run into issues with what if the user refreshses the page for some reason, you lose your counter
[15:31:03] <ceasarbautista> right
[15:31:04] <alystair> I'm having a nightmare with image caching
[15:31:18] <ceasarbautista> that might be okay though
[15:31:20] <gnarf> server side, its still just some var that counts, only its probably a count of their "answers" stored in the db
[15:31:26] <ceasarbautista> right
[15:31:32] <alystair> basically when the page loads I'm using image height for a calculation but sometimes the image doesn't load in time and the height is just '1'
[15:31:41] <ceasarbautista> cool. thank you very much
[15:31:43] <alystair> how can I be absolutely certain the image has actually loaded?
[15:31:54] <ceasarbautista> not sure why I didn't realize that earlier
[15:31:55] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded @alystair
[15:31:56] <bot-t> alystair, imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[15:32:48] <alystair> gnarf: I love you as much a person can love another anonymous contributer on the internet
[15:32:50] * alystair hugs
[15:33:05] <alystair> I've been using load this whole time, haha
[15:33:41] <alystair> which is odd because it's worked except where you just loaded the entire page
[15:34:44] <ShaunR> is there anyway to disable a input field but still allow a user to select the data in it (for copy/paste)
[15:35:11] <ShaunR> right now i'm doing... $('input[name="username"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[15:35:21] * gnarf hugs alystair
[15:36:41] <riyonuk> ciss: I couldn't get it to work. -> window.history.pushState("object", "title", /about);
[15:37:24] <gnarf> riyonuk: unless you just forgot to type the quotes around the /about - thats probably a syntax error
[15:37:49] <riyonuk> gnarf: erm, I meant this one -> window.history.pushState("article", "title", "/about");
[15:38:11] <riyonuk> I pasted that into the console, nothing happened. Feels bad, bro.
[15:38:24] <gnarf> i got zero clue
[15:38:29] <gnarf> never used pushState
[15:38:35] <gnarf> don't feel like researching it right now either
[15:38:53] <riyonuk> LOL. Well, would it just execute if I ran it? I don't really know JS.
[15:39:28] <gnarf> probably? *shrug*
[15:39:37] <riyonuk> For example, I type "window.history.back();", and it just says "undefined", and I'm like >.>
[15:39:51] <gnarf> thats the return of the function
[15:44:18] <alystair> Why is it that Paul Irish always beats me to the punch on everything
[15:44:36] <alystair> does anyone else feel like he's in the vanguard and wherever they go, he was there already?
[15:44:48] <dabear> I just ate a sandwich, and when I didn't burp afterwards, I was like >.>
[15:46:50] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/  I need to toggle the div with the class but only for this div
[15:47:04] <webdev5> there are multiple divs with the same class
[15:47:43] <gnarf> "this" div?
[15:48:04] <webdev5> I tried "this"
[15:48:13] <webdev5> I'm not traversing the div correctly
[15:48:21] <gnarf> $( this ).find( ".availRoles" ).hide() ?
[15:48:30] <webdev5> I'll try that thank you
[15:48:44] <webdev5> find only does children right?
[15:48:49] <gnarf> well "this div" wasn't very specific, which is why i was asking
[15:48:58] <gnarf> find looks for children and grandchildren
[15:49:04] <gnarf> etc
[15:49:07] <gnarf> anything UNDER the div
[15:49:09] <gnarf> ?children
[15:49:10] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[15:49:14] <gnarf> only does immediate childrren
[15:51:22] <webdev5> ok so I click on a plus image
[15:51:39] <webdev5> the div I want to show is up two in parents
[15:51:55] <webdev5> and has a class name .availRoles
[15:52:41] <webdev5> I was thinking something like, "$(this).parents('div').find('.availRoles')
[15:52:47] <webdev5> but that doesn't work
[15:53:37] <abjorn> I find it kind of ironic that robert johnson was given a lifetime achievement award when he died at 27
[15:53:42] <dabear> ?closest
[15:53:42] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:54:09] <webdev5> I'll try that bot-t thanks
[15:54:23] <dabear> ?bot @ webdev5
[15:54:23] <bot-t> webdev5, sentient but living in the machine locale.
[15:58:00] <tripzero> so i have this listview with collapse items in it.  I add/remove one of them from the listview, and call listview('refresh') my listview refreshes but all my items inside lose all style.  Any workarounds for this
[15:58:06] <tripzero> jquery-mobile btw
[15:58:37] <gnarf> i think in mobile they want you to trigger some event
[15:58:43] <gnarf> but im not 100% sure on that
[15:58:49] <webdev5> I tried $(this).closest('.availRoles').toggle();
[15:58:52] <webdev5> that didn't work
[15:58:53] <gnarf> ask in #jquerymobile - might be more people there
[15:59:01] <gnarf> webdev5: closest looks above
[15:59:06] <tripzero> sweet, thanks gnarf
[15:59:15] <gnarf> gotta run tho, see ?glwt
[15:59:15] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[15:59:22] * gnarf disappears
[16:01:03] <StPiere> how can i find a number of checked chekboxes ?
[16:01:16] <webdev5> bot-t is a bot or a person pretending to be a bot?
[16:01:17] <StPiere> $('input:checked').size() ?
[16:02:03] <webdev5> ?glwt
[16:02:03] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[16:02:08] <webdev5> ok I get it now
[16:03:01] <dabear> StPiere: yes, or .length
[16:03:09] <webdev5> dabear, still there?
[16:03:13] <dabear> nope
[16:03:14] <StPiere> thanks
[16:03:18] <webdev5> hehe
[16:03:42] <dabear> I moved a centimeter in my chair
[16:03:48] <webdev5> impressive
[16:03:54] <dabear> so I'm not where I was at some seconds again
[16:03:56] <dabear> ago
[16:04:00] <dabear> *
[16:04:03] <webdev5> you are a freaking ninja
[16:05:52] <webdev5> $(this).closest('.availRoles').toggle(); didn't work dabear, any other ideas?
[16:06:21] <dabear> yes
[16:06:35] <dabear> the issue here is clearly of a pebkac nature
[16:06:45] <dabear> sadly, there is nothing I can do to fix that
[16:07:18] <webdev5> funny
[16:08:17] <dabear> seriously, jsfiddle your code
[16:08:24] <webdev5> I actually did
[16:08:32] <webdev5> I posted it earlier
[16:08:34] <dabear> or look at the console to see the structure of your document
[16:08:35] <webdev5> here it comes again
[16:08:46] <dabear> that's what I gotta do when I look at your code at least
[16:08:50] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/
[16:09:17] <dabear> you just posted a bunch of code
[16:09:45] <dabear> generally posting the smallest example that still breaks, would be better
[16:09:50] <dabear> ?reduce @ webdev5
[16:09:51] <bot-t> webdev5, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[16:11:40] <webdev5> ok I updated the link
[16:12:31] <dabear> now nothing happens
[16:12:37] <dabear> you just defined a js function
[16:13:02] <dabear> and you managed to do that incorrectly too
[16:13:55] <webdev5> thanks for your patience
[16:14:04] <webdev5> how did I define the function incorrectly?
[16:14:09] <StPiere> how to select not checked inputs, i tried input:not(checked) but doesnt work
[16:14:10] <webdev5> oh nm I see
[16:15:08] <webdev5> updated again
[16:16:34] <dabear> webdev5: care to post link to that update
[16:16:35] <dabear> ?
[16:16:58] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/5/
[16:20:17] <webdev5> thank you for your help dabear
[16:22:57] <webdev5> still in your relative position dabear?
[16:23:23] <dabear> as opposed to a static or fixed position?
[16:23:29] <webdev5> exactly
[16:24:09] <webdev5> did my last update help or am I still an extreme noob?
[16:24:30] <dabear> showRoles is undefined
[16:24:44] <dabear> or, rather, it is defined in an inner scope
[16:25:45] <dabear> because jsfiddle wraps your js like this: $(window).load( function(){   function showRoles(){...}   })
[16:26:10] <webdev5> ahh, thank you, how do I compensate?
[16:26:37] <dabear> so showRoles does not exist in the global scope. your image click calls cpde in the global scope
[16:26:44] <dabear> don't use inline js
[16:26:49] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/7/ works though
[16:27:20] <dabear> but you should not use onclick="" attributes in your code
[16:27:34] <dabear> webdev5: buy me a hore
[16:29:08] <webdev5> I will buy you a whore
[16:29:21] <webdev5> what should I use instead of onclick?
[16:29:48] <dabear> selectors in your javascript code?
[16:29:52] <alex87> i have an animate function which has a load callback, which has an animate callback (section fades out, loads new content, fades back in). if the content doesn't load in time the second animation still runs with the old content. how should i be doing this?
[16:30:04] <webdev5> ok
[16:30:08] <dabear> $("a").click( function(){})
[16:30:12] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/8/
[16:30:34] <dabear> yes
[16:30:37] <webdev5> the problem is it  displays both on one click when I want it to only display one
[16:30:42] <dabear> $('.availRoles') selects all those elems
[16:31:03] <dabear> so .toggle on that will toggle all of them on each click
[16:31:17] <webdev5> how do I toggle "this" one
[16:31:29] <webdev5> just "this"
[16:31:39] <dabear> webdev5: first, do what I say
[16:31:44] <dabear> remove the inline code
[16:31:44] <webdev5> ok
[16:32:14] <dabear> webdev5: then see ?next to select the next sibling of an element
[16:32:14] <bot-t> webdev5, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[16:32:25] <dabear> $(this) is the current element
[16:33:19] <StPiere> i have disabled checkbox via .attr('disabled', 'disabled'), ... how to enable it again?
[16:33:42] <dabear> ?removeattr @ StPiere
[16:33:42] <bot-t> StPiere, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[16:34:16] <webdev5> ok thanks dabear
[16:35:08] <StPiere> .removeAttr doesnt seem to have effect. still disabled
[16:35:27] <dabear> StPiere: ?paste
[16:35:32] <dabear> StPiere: see ?paste
[16:35:32] <bot-t> StPiere, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:36:44] <alex87> if .load() doesn't find the url it shouldn't run the callback should it?
[16:37:22] <StPiere> http://jsfiddle.net/ec25x/
[16:39:14] <StPiere> i have multiselect checkboxes with maximal 2 checks
[16:39:19] <dabear> StPiere: that code is useless
[16:39:24] <dabear> ?demo @ StPiere
[16:39:24] <bot-t> StPiere, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:40:12] <dabear> and also, cache your selectors
[16:41:00] <dabear> var inputs = $(".foo input"); input.click( function(){ /* and use $inputs.not(":checked") etc*/   })
[16:41:07] <dabear> inputs*
[16:44:19] <alex87> can i make .load() complete before running the callback?
[16:44:57] <dabear> alex87: huh. callbacks are run when the resource is finished downloading
[16:46:02] <alex87> dabear: that's what i figured, but a client is saying an animation is running before the content is loaded
[16:47:00] <dabear> alex87: run the annimation calls *inside* the callback
[16:47:10] <dabear> -n
[16:47:40] <alex87> dabear: i have a hide animation with a load callback with a show animation callback. i can't replicate the clients behaviour
[16:48:39] <dabear> alex87: one possibility is using different animation queues, which could show that behavior
[16:48:52] <dabear> default queue is called "fx"
[16:49:04] <dabear> ?animate
[16:49:04] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:49:13] <alex87> dabear: i see.. i'll look into that
[16:49:35] <dabear> alex87: look at queue: A Boolean indicating whether to place the animation in the effects queue. If false, the animation will begin immediately.
[16:49:41] <dabear> in the above link
[16:50:24] <alex87> thanks!
[17:04:21] <thinkclay> anyone willing to lend a hand debugging a plugin? I'm having DOM order issues when using appendTo/prependTo and I've spent hours trying to figure this out to no avail
[17:05:32] <ciss> thinkclay: got a link?
[17:05:40] <thinkclay> http://jq-map.chosenclients.com/ is the link, and you can see the script in action at http://jq-map.chosenclients.com/js/supermap.js around line 403 I have slideshow controls
[17:06:33] <thinkclay> Click on a plot on the map, and you'll see a slideshow load, and the prev / next buttons work fine, but then if you close and click another point there's a weird offset that seems to occur
[17:10:00] <thinkclay> and if I log the jq object, the prev / next start returning more than one result which it shouldn't with just .first() and .last() selectors.. unless somehow those selectors are caching in some way
[17:12:14] <Clex> What is the best way to get a <table> specific cell (like tr no 2 td no 5)?
[17:12:46] <thinkclay> Clex: nth-child http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:13:46] <Finity> can I run a click event handler on a link >_>?
[17:14:02] <Clex> Yeah thinkclay, that's it. Thanks a lot.
[17:14:24] <thinkclay> Finity: yes, just make sure to return false after your logic or the browser will follow the link
[17:16:01] <ciss> thinkclay: supermap.js is a custom script?
[17:16:08] <thinkclay> ya
[17:16:42] <thinkclay> I'm working on it for a client that will have many of these maps in the future.. huge PITA
[17:17:07] <thinkclay> The concept in it's most basic form obviously works and I've tested here: http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/fmZ2f/
[17:17:45] <Finity> thinkclay: I feel like I'm doing the most basic of jQuery and nothing happens (firefox error console comes up clean)
[17:17:45] <Finity> http://codepad.org/pj9L4rqi
[17:18:20] <thinkclay> ciss: But its just the .last() and .first() selectors returning more than 1 object.. I have no idea why.. and I've tried variations like first-child and last-child as well
[17:19:45] <thinkclay> finity: have you verified jquery is actually loading via your path? Try simply $(document).ready(function() { alert('jquery is loaded'); }); if that fails, then your script is linked wrong
[17:20:14] <solars> whats the most popular tag cloud plugin?
[17:20:17] <Finity> thinkclay: clicking the link within the view-source dialogue in firefox pulls up the source
[17:20:28] <Finity> (rather than a 404 response output)
[17:20:43] <Finity> thinkclay: I'll try that, though
[17:21:53] <ciss> thinkclay: is ssp-control is dynamically inserted, or does the class get applied dynamically?
[17:22:20] <ciss> ah, nvm
[17:24:26] <thinkclay> finity: i pasted in a fork that works
[17:25:34] <thinkclay> finity: <script> needs closing </script> and for the most part document ready is more suited for basics than anonymous enclosures, at least until you get your feet wet
[17:26:04] <thinkclay> http://codepad.org/oT0y32iG
[17:27:40] <ciss> thinkclay: on a side note: you should seriously consider caching your selectors and using variables instead. makes your code much less error prone
[17:27:53] <Finity> thinkclay: apparently it was the closing /script
[17:28:02] <Finity> I feel like I've never done that before, though o.O
[17:28:11] <Finity> (i.e., the selfclosing tag worked fine)
[17:28:28] <Finity> who knows, maybe I'm rbeing silly
[17:28:49] <Finity> yeah, even the examples in this jQuery book have the closing script tag
[17:28:51] <thinkclay> ciss: I know, I started going through and caching, but I've been on such a crunch lately, I've just whipped through (and now I'm paying for it)
[17:30:21] <thinkclay> finity: no worries, it's usually the little gotchyas that will frustrate you in the beginning, but getting a second set of eyes always helps. Hit me up whenever you need code reviewed @thinkclay on twitter
[17:30:42] <Finity> thinkclay: ty :)
[17:30:53] <thinkclay> np
[17:38:06] <ciss> thinkclay: for starters, try replacing lines 395-415 with this code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/481396/
[17:39:04] <ciss> i don't mind if you add some log statements :)
[17:40:36] <thinkclay> I will do so and give you updated link. Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it
[17:40:59] <ciss> if you have ui elements, don't rely on selectors to retrieve them. find (or create) them and assign them to variables, then do any operations like assigning handlers on the variables
[17:41:07] <ciss> will spare you a lot of pain
[17:43:31] <thinkclay> ciss: that seems to have solved the offset, I'm testing a bit more to make sure
[17:49:14] <freedrull> i forget, how can you bind() to an element that doesn't exist yet?
[17:49:34] <thinkclay> freedrull: .live()
[17:49:56] <freedrull> ah yeh, thanks thinkclay
[17:49:56] <thinkclay> ciss: that was it.. works like a charm http://jq-map.chosenclients.com/
[17:50:28] <thinkclay> ciss: you have a paypal email? :)
[17:51:41] <ciss> thinkclay: nevermind, happy to help :)
[17:53:12] <thinkclay> ciss: well thanks a lot bud. You saved me a lot of frustration, don't hesitate to hit me up (thinkclay on just about any network) if you ever need a second set of eyes.. I'm a lot stronger with php ^.^
[17:53:54] <ciss> thanks, i'll keep that in mind ;)
[17:55:07] <bobdobbs> speaking of second set of eyes, I was wondering if anyone could look at this code snippet with ,
[17:55:13] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.com/1ETgKjBX
[17:55:27] <bobdobbs> It's just a simple use of  $.get.
[17:56:04] <bobdobbs> Is there any obvious reason why it would fail to return a resource?
[17:56:18] <ciss> bobdobbs: jsfiddle.net is far better suited for that than pastebin
[17:57:01] <thinkclay> bobdobbs: cross domain scripting is going to be an issue first and foremost
[17:57:08] <bobdobbs> ciss: You sure? It's just a small snippet. I find jsfiddle more suited to more complex stuff.
[17:57:52] <sparuvu> I have a button on top of the text box. The button's width changes dynamically based on its width I need to change the left padding of the text boxâ€¦.
[17:57:53] <sparuvu> how do I do this ?
[17:58:25] <bobdobbs> thinkclay: In this case, my target resource will be request issued against a rest-based API
[17:58:43] <thinkclay> sparuvu: can you give an example via jsfiddle.net
[17:58:50] <sparuvu> sure...
[17:59:06] <thinkclay> bobdobbs: do you get any errors currently in console?
[17:59:08] <ciss> bobdobbs: jsfiddle is also great for small snippets. anyway, if you run into problems using jquery's ajax functions, try using the verbose .ajax() version mentioned on the docs page. add a complete callback and output any arguments that get passed
[17:59:54] <bobdobbs> ciss: ok. I'll do a debug run using $.ajax.
[18:04:46] <ciss> thinkclay: any frameworks or cms you've specialized in?
[18:05:31] <thinkclay> ciss: kohana, zend and codeignitor as well as WP, Magento, and ExpressionEngine
[18:06:07] <ciss> darn :)
[18:06:47] <thinkclay> ciss: what you looking for specifically, i've done a bit in other frameworks (besides pretty much anything is easier than Zend)
[18:07:05] <sparuvu> thinkclay :: here is the example to my problem  http://jsfiddle.net/YPttY/
[18:07:18] <sparuvu> can you tell me how to padd the text box dynamically ?
[18:07:36] <sparuvu> the width of the button cannot be made fixed
[18:11:38] <bobdobbs> ciss: here is my fiddled, updated troubleshooting code:
[18:11:44] <bobdobbs> http://jsfiddle.net/sdNgC/1/
[18:12:08] <bobdobbs> In this case, the value of 'str' is just an example.
[18:12:15] <thinkclay> sparuvu: is this along the lines of what you're looking for http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/YPttY/1/
[18:12:40] <bobdobbs> But I'm wondering if there's something obviously wrong with it. My real-life version isn't returning a response from the server.
[18:13:27] <ciss> bobdobbs: what does firebug's network tab tell you?
[18:14:21] <ciss> thinkclay: my framework of choice is yii, i've got some legacy projects in cake (1.2, i believe), and right now i'm heavily using drupal 6
[18:14:35] <bobdobbs> fb raises no errors with the code. The request is issued successfully... but the response tab is empty.
[18:14:49] <ciss> bobdobbs: same domain?
[18:15:07] <lenswipe> hey folk
[18:15:09] <lenswipe> folks*
[18:15:18] <bobdobbs> I'm having trouble figuring out what the empty response tab in fb means, so I'm setting up wireshark to look at the http traffic.
[18:15:57] <ciss> bobdobbs: what do you get when you access the url directly?
[18:15:58] <lenswipe> Im trying to write some JQ code so that when i click a <tr> the radio button child of that <tr> is selected link: http://pastebin.com/0Rk4MKhf
[18:16:01] <lenswipe> what am i doing wrong?
[18:16:07] <lenswipe> at the moment only the last one is selected
[18:16:22] <bobdobbs> ciss: I get what I expect - the json response
[18:16:45] <bobdobbs> ciss: the difference between the raw browser request and the request from my code confuses me.
[18:16:50] <thinkclay> bobdobbs: I got an example working that doesnt rely on JSON http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/sdNgC/2/
[18:17:00] <ciss> bobdobbs: it has to be: dataType: 'json'
[18:17:22] <thinkclay> PS, when using jsfiddle, set the library on the left and test your code using 'run' at the top
[18:17:37] <ciss> also, the semicolon is completely wrong
[18:17:48] <bobdobbs> hmmmm
[18:17:57] <lenswipe> what am i doing wrong?
[18:17:59] <lenswipe> Im trying to write some JQ code so that when i click a <tr> the radio button child of that <tr> is selected link: http://pastebin.com/0Rk4MKhf
[18:18:00] <ciss> thinkclay: won't do much with an example.com url ;)
[18:18:19] <ciss> lenswipe: don't repost
[18:18:41] <thinkclay> ciss: yah, thats why i dropped in my test server which has xdomain allowed
[18:20:02] <thinkclay> lenswipe: can you use jsfiddle? It's a lot easier to work with :)
[18:20:32] <lenswipe> ok
[18:21:06] <lenswipe> thinkclay, nswipe: can you use jsfiddle? It's a lot easier to work with :)
[18:21:06] <lenswipe> <lenswipe> ok
[18:21:08] <lenswipe> err
[18:21:09] <lenswipe> sorry
[18:21:16] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/bbj5W/
[18:21:19] <lenswipe> thats what i meant to paste
[18:22:21] <bobdobbs> ciss: I've updated my example with the actual real call. I'm looking at your code to see what the difference is between mine and yours, but I can't quiet see it. What am I missing?
[18:23:31] <ciss> bobdobbs: http://jsfiddle.net/NPWWZ/
[18:24:03] <bobdobbs> thanks
[18:24:54] <thinkclay> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/bbj5W/2/
[18:25:27] <lenswipe> thanks
[18:27:19] <bobdobbs> ciss: I've never used console.log before. This will be interesing.
[18:28:14] <coldhead> welcome to the future, bobdobbs!
[18:28:19] <bobdobbs> :)
[18:28:23] <ciss> :D
[18:28:43] <coldhead> a fun thing to do is console.log(jQuery)
[18:28:43] <ciss> "welcome to the world of tomorrow!"
[18:28:54] <coldhead> then click on the object in the console to expand it
[18:29:01] <coldhead> and you can explore all the magical magic
[18:29:18] <bobdobbs> kewl :)
[18:33:22] <bobdobbs> I think I see the problem, but I'm not sure about the solution...
[18:35:26] <bobdobbs> actually, I just got a new result that confuses me even more. I'm going to take a break for a while then come back to it. Thanks for the assistance guys.
[18:35:48] <ciss> yw
[18:47:04] <vanmik> Why this "$('<xml></xml>').append('<test>world</test>');" not working in IE (6-9)? It brings me an error. jQuery bug? (using latest 1.6.4 version)
[18:53:18] <guy> can anyone suggest an alternative for http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/dynamic_javascript.html ? this one is very old & I am having some computability issues.
[19:03:49] <coldhead> guy: this is quite popular and stable http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[19:04:40] <guy> it doesn't have feature to display multiple
[19:04:49] <coldhead> OH DOESN'T IT
[19:05:09] <guy> coldhead: I didn't find it in intermediate/advance demos.
[19:05:17] <coldhead> yeah well forget it, pal
[19:05:22] <coldhead> JUST FORGET IT
[19:05:31] <coldhead> um i believe this is more recent than the carousel you're usig
[19:05:33] <coldhead> http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/
[19:05:44] <coldhead> so it might be better compatible
[19:06:18] <guy> found this. but it doesn't have AJAX as opposed to jcarousel. (started to write his own plugin, anyway.)
[19:06:35] <guy> shouldn't take more than one hour
[19:06:43] <coldhead> yeah it's not hard
[19:06:58] <coldhead> the trickiest part is usually adding controls
[19:11:21] <guy> would it be right to have a variable dom that'd hold cached selectors?
[19:11:42] <guy> not very..
[19:11:42] <cryptopsy> is there a javascript lib for that 'word cloud' thing people have on their websites
[19:11:57] <cryptopsy> its like a series of hot topics, and the most popular ones has larger fonts
[19:12:16] <guy> cryptopsy: Google "keyword cloud"
[19:12:22] <cryptopsy> but in js
[19:12:37] <guy> though they are useless UI/SEO components
[19:12:55] <cryptopsy> useless why?
[19:13:14] <cryptopsy> i thought it was pretty clever
[19:13:25] <cryptopsy> anyways, there's no js lib for this kind of statistics?
[19:13:36] <guy> cryptopsy: GOOGLE
[19:13:38] <guy> GOOGLE!
[19:14:20] <cryptopsy> i don't traffic analysis
[19:14:32] <coldhead> there are like 300 wordcloud plugins
[19:14:35] <cryptopsy> just various ways to summarize my website, like by size, date, that kind of thing
[19:15:01] <cryptopsy> i guess the best place to find those plugins r in wordpress?
[19:15:23] <cryptopsy> a good majority of my site must be dynamically generated
[19:15:45] <ciss_> cryptopsy: there are, like, millions of blog articles comparing the best cloud plugins for jquery. just make your pick
[19:15:56] <cryptopsy> thanks
[19:15:57] <ciss_> ... "best"
[19:16:36] <cryptopsy> oh i didn't know they were based on jquery
[19:16:45] <cryptopsy> are there js code obfuscators?
[19:17:41] <ciss_> cryptopsy: you're aware you're in #jquery?
[19:18:29] <cryptopsy> ciss_: yea i don't know if those things are based on jquery
[19:18:40] <cryptopsy> for example those cloud things r
[19:18:43] <guy> I've never benchmarked that, though is there a big difference between using jQuery's $.each VS old fashion for([..]  length < [..] )
[19:18:46] <guy> ?
[19:20:01] <ciss_> cryptopsy: are you talking about minifying or obfuscating js?
[19:20:35] <frankbro> I have a small problem with jquery ui in the dialog part. This is my code : http://pastebin.com/MhvQBSU9. Basicly, on the page being opened, the POST of the form isn't being made and if I close the dialog and try to load another link, I get "c[m][n] is undefined
[19:20:35] <frankbro> http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/js/jquery.js
[19:20:35] <frankbro> Line 25".
[19:21:20] <ciss_> guy: don't think so, each should be pretty efficient. you can of course optimize your code to death, but good luck with maintaining it after that
[19:21:29] <guy> : )
[19:27:36] <ciss_> frankbro: just a remark: use click(function(e) { ... and e.preventDefault() instead of return false
[19:31:23] <ciss_> frankbro: what does dialog.dialog('open'); do? is it supposed to display the loaded content? or does it show a loading animation and gets updated once the content is loaded?
[19:31:41] <guy> $ === jQuery
[19:31:42] <guy> right?
[19:31:51] <ciss_> usually, yes
[19:31:59] <guy> so, (function($){})($); is perfectly fine?
[19:33:38] <Guest78900> frankbro: if you're getting cryptic errors, you can temporarily switch to jquery's development version (the unminified one)
[20:04:55] <frankbro> ciss, it displays the content the first time without problem
[20:07:02] <frankbro> ciss, also, it gives me the same error
[20:08:57] <Accelerator> Know of any jQuery scripts that dynamicly kind of make an image glow? Or if it's even possible?
[20:09:01] <Accelerator> For example,
[20:09:21] <Accelerator> http://4img.me <- I'd like to make the links in the nav menu kind of have an underwater/wave effect.
[20:09:25] <Accelerator> To match the background.
[20:10:02] <frankbro> ciss, saw what I typed?
[20:10:19] <Accelerator> Maybe I should repost that in a minute.
[20:11:45] <ciss> frankbro: just did. did you replace jquery?
[20:11:59] <ciss> Accelerator: dont
[20:12:10] <Accelerator> ciss: I mean due to the netsplit.
[20:12:21] <ciss> Accelerator: ah, ok :)
[20:12:58] <frankbro> ciss, yes, I get the non-min version when I click it in firebug
[20:13:57] <ciss> Accelerator: theoretically it's possible to modify image data in javascript, but it would probably be slow as hell. what you're describing would require either flash or canvas. svg might be a third option
[20:14:42] <Accelerator> ciss: I just mean an effect for the text, to amke it glow a variation of colors to kind of simulate an underwater effect
[20:14:47] <Accelerator> No manipulate the background itself
[20:14:53] <ciss> you might also be able to do some tricks with alpha transparency
[20:15:09] <ciss> Accelerator: you can use css3 shadow effects
[20:18:26] <dancaster> hey there. i'm developing a jquery plugin that needs to be called without a selector to do things that apply to the plugin as a whole (working with a three.js scene in this case). what's the best way to do this? add $.plugin to the namespace as a separate function, or perhaps call the plugin with an empty selector? $().plugin?
[20:18:32] <dancaster> any tips?
[20:23:32] <ciss> dancaster: $.plugin should be fine
[20:24:18] <Accelerator> http://activeden.net/item/advanced-glow-text-animation-v2/81605?WT.ac=category_item&WT.seg_1=category_item&WT.z_author=flash_fx This is kind of what I'm looking for.
[20:24:22] <dancaster> great thanks. i've been storing general stuff in document.body.data(), is that the right place?
[20:24:24] <Accelerator> Except a constant colored glow.
[20:24:30] <Hail_Spacecake> what's the best way to use a html form
[20:25:03] <Hail_Spacecake> to allow a user to enter data that the page itself will parse, rather than causing a request?
[20:25:27] <Hail_Spacecake> you can hook a .submit() onto the element, I guess, preventDefault() and then do whatever
[20:25:32] <Hail_Spacecake> but I'm nto sure what's the preferred way
[20:26:14] <ciss> Accelerator: i already told you: use css3 shadows
[20:26:44] <Finity> Hail_Spacecake: I know that ASP.NET uses basically that method for for client side form validation (once that passes, it then sends it to the server and re-validates)
[20:26:58] <Accelerator> ciss: Yeah, but I'm not looking for a static effect is what I'm saying.
[20:27:25] <ciss> Accelerator: you're aware that you can animate css properties with javascript?
[20:27:47] <Accelerator> Ahhh, nevermind, I see what you mean now, sorry.
[20:27:58] <Finity> Hail_Spacecake: essentially the submit's button click even executes javascript for client side validation.  Pretty simple.  Not sure if you're doing any sort of validation, but whatever your doing with it, I'd imagine it's a perfectly accetable solution
[20:28:05] <Finity> event*
[20:28:13] <Finity> acceptable*
[20:28:31] <ciss> dancaster: not sure about that. might wanna check the guide for jquery's data cache
[20:29:40] <dancaster> ciss: okay thanks

[21:46:29] <rosco_y> When I use a Jquery plugin, then is the javascript actually interpreted on the client machine?
[21:47:35] <rosco_y> I'll check for answers periodically--it's not critical.  Thanks in advance!
[21:55:08] <vviljanen> rosco_y: yes.
[21:55:31] <vviljanen> all javascript is interpreted at the clients browser
[21:55:41] <alystair> what's the normal way to create items outside of existing dom?
[21:55:52] <snover> wut?
[21:55:55] <alystair> <div/> ?
[21:56:09] <alystair> $('<div/>')?
[21:56:10] <ciss> alystair: yes
[21:56:14] <alystair> ok.
[21:56:44] <alystair> can it be a non-div element such as an image or would that be appended to the div?
[21:56:57] <snover> ?tias @ alystair
[21:56:58] <bot-t> alystair, Try It And See
[21:57:00] <alystair> where can I read more about it
[21:57:09] <alystair> like doing things outside of the document
[21:57:33] <alystair> ok, JFDI approach it is
[22:14:38] <alystair> hrm
[22:15:46] <rosco_y> Thank you wiljanen.....happy codes to everyone....
[22:16:02] <alystair> ok I'm assuming creating these out-of-dom objects could create a serious leak
[22:16:18] <alystair> I should destroy em when I'm done right?
[22:16:29] <alystair> or does jquery automagically deal with that once it's done its thing
[22:24:59] <snover> what are you doing with DOM objects that you never attach to the document?
[22:39:58] <threecircle> Hi, I have a question about the .resize event â€¦ I'm using it to get some layout to change and I'm having trouble avoiding the flash of unformatted content. How do I avoid that?
[22:43:31] <threecircle> Anyone in here?
[22:45:10] <PL_Przemek> Hey all, I have a question.
[22:45:26] <PL_Przemek> How to make http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ match only John not ex. Johny?
[22:45:33] <danieliser> anybody got experience with jquery and css3pie?
[22:45:44] <PL_Przemek> css3pie
[22:46:21] <PL_Przemek> shouldn't take your attention
[22:46:49] <PL_Przemek> Browsers must be compatible with standards, not CSS3 with browsers
[22:47:21] <PL_Przemek> However, someone know how to help me?
[22:47:28] <PL_Przemek> I'm totally newbie.
[22:47:34] <danieliser> ok lets try it a different way then.. any ie6, 7 8 border-raidus fixes?
[22:49:18] <PL_Przemek> Probably no, but not CSS, XHTML etc should work all right with browsers, that browsers should do it.
[22:49:40] <PL_Przemek> If browser doesn't meet the standards it's just need to be leftr.
[22:49:43] <PL_Przemek> left*
[22:50:09] <PL_Przemek> Not be supported in some tricky ways...
[22:50:49] <PL_Przemek> You know how to make contains selector match only ex. John, but not Johny or MeJohny?
[22:51:50] <danieliser> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/303956/jquery-select-a-which-href-contains-some-string
[22:55:50] <PL_Przemek> Thanks.
[23:10:25] <haizum> i'm trying to trigger a css property change using the .click event, which i can do, but i also want it to revert back right after the click is performed...
[23:10:33] <haizum> ?
[23:11:49] <haizum> would i use a timeout?
[23:15:28] <haizum> basically, i have an image gallery... when user clicks "maximize", i want a css value changed. when they click the same button again, but in maximize mode, i want it to change back (with a click event)
[23:29:36] <posplaw> haizum: its not jquery question at all, but thereis a tip: make an object with property of your maximize state, and use toggle function on click
[23:35:45] <patrick99e99> howdy jQuery folks..  I am trying to clone a <textarea> but when I do .clone() or .clone(true), it doesn't seem to copy the text contents...
[23:35:48] <patrick99e99> what am I doing wrong?
[23:36:25] <patrick99e99> it works fine with input type=text..
[23:36:28] <patrick99e99> just not with textareas
