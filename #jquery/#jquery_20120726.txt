[00:04:55] <godlfishh> what should i even look up?
[00:08:03] <kreantos> hello, im trying to get the height of an element wich might be not jet renderd. its working perfectly in chrome but no chance in firefox
[00:08:12] <kreantos> is there a solution for this problem?
[00:15:39] <ENQ> do i have to do $.each() in all my plugin methods? to not break chainability? or there is other way?
[00:24:29] <hc_> $.parsexml not working in firefox
[00:24:35] <hc_> ?
[00:25:39] <hc_> $.parsexml not working in firefox
[00:25:40] <hc_> ?
[00:25:57] <coldhead> ENQ: it depends how your plugin works, usually you let jQuery handle the each stuff for you and your code gets called for reach element in turn, then it only has to return `this`;
[00:26:19] <coldhead> $.parsexml should work in firefox, can you be more specific
[00:26:21] <coldhead> $.parsexml should work in firefox, can you be more specific
[00:26:41] <hc_>             var xml = $.parseXML(data);
[00:26:48] <hc_> does notinh
[00:27:06] <coldhead> perhaps your XML is not valid
[00:27:14] <ENQ> coldhead, so then in main plugin function i just get one object? no array of them? becous now i get what i select and call my plugin on
[00:27:23] <coldhead> can you build a test case on jsfiddle, hc_ ?
[00:27:51] <coldhead> have you read this, ENQ? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[00:27:57] <ENQ> yes
[00:28:06] <ENQ> i follow this tutorial
[00:28:07] <coldhead> so if you're working on a bunch
[00:28:19] <coldhead> return this.each is fine
[00:28:20] <hc_> <coldhead> ok
[00:28:38] <ENQ> isnt there other way? then do this.each all the time?
[00:28:46] <ENQ> in each plugin function i mean
[00:29:10] <coldhead> we would need to see your code to understand the problem you are having, ENQ
[00:33:58] <ENQ> http://fiddle.jshell.net/nnq8Q/
[00:34:12] <ENQ> coldhead, if you have a min
[00:35:12] <ENQ> can i use $.each or $.map in main plugin function insstead of using it in all public plugin functions?
[00:35:42] <ENQ> maybe there is some disadvatages?
[00:37:57] <godlfishh> ok, plz help how do I add a class label to this $(this)
[00:38:12] <pneftali> addClass
[00:38:20] <ENQ> $(this).addClass('label');
[01:09:10] <Pitel_laptop> what is the best way to get n-th selected element? like, 4th <li>
[01:09:38] <Pitel_laptop> oh, just found it..
[01:09:41] <Pitel_laptop> :eq()
[01:11:42] <ENQ> would someone be so kind and look at my plugin? http://fiddle.jshell.net/nnq8Q/1/
[01:11:49] <ENQ> im i doing it right?
[01:14:53] <shoky> ENQ: Fetchy should be a local _var_
[01:15:25] <ENQ> the function?
[01:16:12] <shoky> yes
[01:16:15] <shoky> well, defaults too
[01:16:24] <ENQ> might i ask why?
[01:16:30] <ENQ> or just to define
[01:16:42] <shoky> cause otherwise you are overwriting/creating in the global scope
[01:16:54] <ENQ> oh, i see, me fix it :)
[01:16:57] <ENQ> ty
[01:16:59] <shoky> instead of the local scope that you created just for the sake of having a local scope
[01:17:31] <ENQ> Fetchy.prototype should be "var Fetchy.prototype" too?
[01:17:38] <shoky> no ;)
[01:17:47] <shoky> it is referencing the local var Fetchy
[01:17:58] <shoky> and accessing its prototype field
[01:18:07] <shoky> well, setting
[01:18:43] <ENQ> ok thanks, can i ask another question? is main function good?
[01:18:52] <ENQ> jQuery.fn.fetchy,
[01:19:22] <shoky> it's alright, i think,
[01:19:35] <ENQ> is there any disadvantage by doing it in the way its done, and proposed on site?
[01:19:45] <shoky> but. first of all, no need to cache the 'm' argument as a local var, because arguments already are local vars
[01:19:52] <ENQ> the $.each in all public plugin functions way
[01:20:26] <ENQ> but will it be accessable in $.each scope?
[01:20:30] <shoky> yes
[01:20:58] <ENQ> ok, fixed it, somehow had problems before..
[01:21:38] <shoky> hm
[01:21:58] <shoky> one line says:   if( typeof _fetchy[method] === 'function'
[01:22:10] <shoky> a following line says:  if( typeof method === 'object' )
[01:22:12] <ENQ> it is
[01:22:15] <dirkpennings> hi guys, I can't get a next() selector to work, what I am doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/UnNke/
[01:23:51] <ENQ> shoky, in function check it cheks if fetchy got such function, other is for setting options, like fetchy({}) nad fetchy('something', {})
[01:24:18] <shoky> ENQ i was just pointing out that you're accessing _fetchy[method]  _before_ even checking if method is a string
[01:25:03] <shoky> dirkpennings: .next() only looks at the immediately following sibling
[01:25:46] <shoky> dirkpennings: try:  .nextAll('.collapsable').first()
[01:26:52] <shoky> ENQ: also no reason to return $(this);  in the .each
[01:27:09] <shoky> the only thing to return from an each is false, if you want to break the loop
[01:27:45] <ENQ> shoky, as you are so helpfull, might ask is this is right? http://screencast.com/t/dozhdAT8j should prototype functions be in object and __proto__, not only in __proto__?
[01:27:53] <ENQ> ok me fix this too :)
[01:28:20] <shoky> no idea what you just asked ;P
[01:28:29] <ENQ> about the screenshot
[01:28:44] <shoky> ah
[01:28:58] <ENQ> its fetchy object, and should there be hide,show functions in there?
[01:29:17] <ENQ> thought it should be in __proto__
[01:29:37] <shoky> it's a Fetchy instance?
[01:29:42] <ENQ> yes
[01:30:00] <Tulip> Hi, I want to loop through automatically generated ids in jquery
[01:30:01] <shoky> so that's fine
[01:30:22] <shoky> ENQ: since the prototype defines those functions, your instance also has them
[01:30:26] <shoky> i think..
[01:30:50] <ENQ> so they arent created on each instance?
[01:31:00] <ENQ> thats why use prototype isnt it?
[01:31:08] <shoky> mm
[01:31:49] <ENQ> i have read something about it, and decided to try
[01:32:35] <Tulip> Hi, I want to loop through automatically generated ids in jquery
[01:33:06] <ENQ> Tulip, you can use $.each(array_to_loop, function(){});
[01:33:55] <Tulip> ENQ: then do i need to assign all those ids in array?
[01:34:20] <ENQ> well where is thos ids anyways?
[01:34:34] <shoky> ENQ: i think it's just firebug showing you the functions from the prototype
[01:34:52] <shoky> ENQ: in chrome i don't see those functions on the object itself
[01:35:00] <Tulip> they are getting generated automatically using module
[01:35:23] <ENQ> Tulip, are they in object? array? text string separated by ";" or smth?
[01:35:31] <ENQ> shoky, me check in chrome too :)
[01:36:28] <ENQ> yes it seems firebug got a bug, or is it a feature
[01:39:16] <Tulip> ENQ: no i guess they just getting generated automatically i just want loop through them is it possible when i not knowing whetheer they are in array or objects?
[01:39:39] <ENQ> yes, use $.each
[01:39:56] <ENQ> idk if it loops throw object tho
[01:40:18] <Tulip> ENQ: but array_to_loop what should i here then?
[01:40:35] <ENQ> well how you retriev ids?
[01:41:47] <Tulip> i am able to see them only in firebug i dont knw behind the scene whr they generating i just want apply css to them and i think its possible by looping through them!
[01:41:49] <shoky> ENQ: if you click in firebug next to the DOM tab , you can set 'show own properties only'
[01:41:58] <shoky> ENQ: but then, it doesn't show the __proto__
[01:42:01] <shoky> lame
[01:42:58] <Tulip> ENQ: i am able to see them only in firebug i dont knw behind the scene whr they generating i just want to apply css to them and i think its possible by looping through them!
[01:43:32] <ENQ> so they are in DOM>
[01:43:57] <ENQ> shoky, its cool, if its works as it should :) thanks for help
[01:45:07] <Tulip> ENQ: yeah they are in DOM
[01:45:53] <ENQ> then use jquery selector to select it $("selector").addClass("some_class");
[01:45:56] <ENQ> or so
[01:47:41] <Tulip> ENQ: views-row-1 this is the call its last number is getting changed every time so what shoul i use .addClass("here")?
[01:48:23] <ENQ> $(".views-row-1").addClass() will add some css class to that row
[01:49:48] <Tulip> ENQ: but if i use .views-row-1 this as selector and add class to it how will it apply to other classes such as to .views-row-2,.views-row-3 and so on?
[01:50:15] <ENQ> apply class on they parent?
[01:50:27] <shoky> Tulip you can also try $('[id^="views-row-"]') to get all elements with id starting with views-row-
[01:50:30] <ENQ> $(".views-row-1").parent() if you dont know its id or class
[01:51:41] <shoky> but it's best if you know more about the dom structure and where these elements will be
[01:51:44] <Tulip> shoky: thanks m trying it may be that will help me
[01:51:55] <shoky> cause what i said will search every single element in the dom
[01:52:32] <Tulip> ENQ: I know its classes and ids i cn view them
[01:53:12] <shoky> Tulip are all these rows under one parent?
[01:53:55] <Tulip> shoky: yeah
[01:54:06] <shoky> Tulip: what's the parent?
[01:54:23] <shoky> Tulip: and, are these rows the only elements inside the parent?
[01:56:23] <shoky> anyways, gotta go
[01:56:35] <ENQ> later shoky
[01:56:38] <Lucky--> holy crap, is it just me or is amazon web services portal down!?
[01:56:50] <ravenzz> why the change event doesn't trigger here http://jsfiddle.net/wAG72/

[01:57:15] <ENQ> it does trigger
[01:57:59] <ravenzz> I don't notice any alert
[01:58:14] <ENQ> ravenzz, i get alerts
[01:58:34] <ravenzz> Doesn't the change event is fired when the value is changed by val() ?
[01:58:47] <ENQ> why should it?
[01:58:48] <ravenzz> ENQ of course I mean when I click the button
[01:58:59] <ravenzz> isn't that a change? :|
[01:59:00] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/GXb56/12/ How do I get the drop-down to re-appear when I select 'None', it hides nicely onselect

[01:59:45] <ravenzz> okkei
[02:00:12] <ravenzz> and isn't there a way to do what I meant?
[02:00:31] <faraway> ravenzz: you can trigger it yourself when you change the val
[02:01:00] <ravenzz> yes of course, but it is a bit annoying and not flexible
[02:02:37] <Tulip> ENQ: M sharing link please have a look on it http://screencast.com/t/RwQLJT4A
[02:03:26] <Tulip> shoky: M sharing link please have a look on it http://screencast.com/t/RwQLJT4A
[02:04:04] <ENQ> Tulip, use $(".views-row").addClass();
[02:08:00] <Tulip> ENQ: But the rows are unique if i use this it will apply css to all rows within tht area i want apply css to every row on hovering on it
[02:08:03] <faraway> ravenzz: you could extend jquery yourself with a valWithChangeEvent function or what ever
[02:08:23] <ravenzz> that is what I thought
[02:08:23] <Tulip> individually
[02:09:00] <ravenzz> anyway a change is a change, not matter if it is made by hand or with val()
[02:09:07] <ENQ> shure Tulip $(".views-row").on('hover', function(){ $(this).addClass("hovered"); });
[02:09:23] <ravenzz> gotta go to buy sigarets anyway, bbl

[02:29:16] <GhostBear> Hello. I want to dynamically create form and do few validations before submit. Its unknown to me if target page will have jquery so i'm wondering how I should include jquery with my form so it would be compatible with existing jquery if there is already one present on page.
[02:33:26] <dirkpennings> shoky: bit late, but why is there a selector option for next() if it's useless?
[02:38:41] <ikosen> I have a problem when using a jquery plugin (http://www.madeincima.it/en/articles/resources-and-tools/easy-accordion-plugin/) I have made a site based on that plugin, but it does not load correctly every time its loaded. The site it: www.ydefeldt.com/sd can someone see what the problem might be?
[02:45:02] <shoky> dirkpennings: the selector just serves as a filter there
[02:47:28] <some_dude> .width()/height() always return 0, what to do, WHAT TO DO?
[02:47:45] <sacho> don't use width() and height() before rendering?
[02:48:47] <wathek> is there a way to select the next element to the element that has the class .selected ?
[02:49:06] <imakewebthings> $('.selected').next()
[02:49:18] <some_dude> sacho: I'm using it at (window).load() still doesn't work
[02:49:41] <some_dude> sacho: btw im using width() on regular divs not images
[02:50:07] <wathek> imakewebthings, thank you
[02:50:25] <imakewebthings> some_dude: and web inspector tells you that those elements do in fact have a width?
[02:50:57] <some_dude> imakewebthings: dont know what web inspector is, but the div has with and height set in the html
[02:51:09] <imakewebthings> webkit web inspector
[02:51:10] <imakewebthings> or firebug
[02:52:35] <imakewebthings> know how to use either? or are some links in order
[02:52:46] <some_dude> im using firebug
[02:53:00] <imakewebthings> so firebug shows that this element has a width
[02:53:09] <imakewebthings> in, say, the computer style tab
[02:53:13] <imakewebthings> computed*
[02:53:22] <imakewebthings> or the layout diagram
[03:08:52] <ENQ> is there something like $.isValidSelector(".a_class")?
[03:09:54] <sacho> I don't think there is.
[03:10:06] <ENQ> thats bad
[03:10:30] <NodeX> why
[03:10:35] <NodeX> why is that bad*
[03:11:01] <ENQ> i need to check if a string is a selector, or its element creation and need to be appended
[03:11:18] <NodeX> regex
[03:11:32] <ENQ> blah, ok, me do so
[03:11:40] <sacho> ENQ, check out how jquery() does it.
[03:11:54] <ENQ> yes, will borrow it :D
[03:15:11] <ENQ> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L104 here it is, possible to retriew it?
[03:15:57] <shoky> retriew?
[03:16:24] <ENQ> yes, like $.rquickExpr
[03:16:28] <ENQ> or smth
[03:16:29] <ENQ> idk
[03:16:44] <shoky> what is retriew
[03:16:58] <shoky> oh retrieve ?
[03:17:07] <sacho> rquickExpr = /^(?:[^#<]*(<[\w\W]+>)[^>]*$|#([\w\-]*)$)/,
[03:17:24] <ENQ> dynamicaly? :D
[03:17:31] <shoky> what for
[03:17:36] <ENQ> idk
[03:17:46] <shoky> nah, no way
[03:17:50] <ENQ> i see
[03:18:09] * norbi waves ans says hello
[03:18:22] <norbi> guys, this is not working for me, why? var nr=$(".input:last",$(this).parent()).attr("id");
[03:18:34] <rosieres> stupid question: I push offset() of some containers into an array how do I can retrieve each .top of that cascaded array best ?
[03:18:37] <norbi> it gives me undefined all the time
[03:19:13] <shoky> norbi how in the world are we supposed to know?
[03:19:26] <sacho> why don't you bloody debug it step by step?
[03:19:47] <shoky> but its all one big step!!
[03:20:16] <sacho> rosieres, map()
[03:20:40] <shoky> $.map(), that is
[03:21:00] <norbi> shoky: i thought there is something incorrect in that statement, but if its correct and it should work that way, then i will debug it.
[03:21:21] <rosieres> sacho shoky: cool, thanks !
[03:21:21] <shoky> its correct in that its doing what it says its doing
[03:21:36] <shoky> whether that is correct for your needs is another question
[03:22:50] <shoky> norbi: btw better and nicer to just do:  $(this).parent().find(".input:last").attr("id")
[03:28:23] <soee> what would be the best event to use to process some link inside input field when user put some link there ?
[03:28:41] <sunbeam> i have an input field, which in a certain context, is $(this), after $(this) (after <input />) i like to place something like <span class="error">[*]</span>
[03:28:44] <sunbeam> how can I do this?
[03:28:53] <astropirate> soee, keyup i'd say
[03:29:20] <Bigsista> is there a plugin to ease walking throug deep json arrays anyone can recommend?
[03:29:25] <ecthiender> sunbeam, look at the .after() method of jquery
[03:29:38] <soee> astropirate, ok ill try
[03:35:31] <sunbeam> ecthiender: ok
[03:38:08] <rosieres> shoky sacho: found out that map() seems to complicated and found within the comments of api.jquery.com/offset that  .offset().top is all I need when I push my Data to the array.... nevertheless thank you for you help
[03:41:46] <sunbeam> $(this).removeClass.closest('error');
[03:41:49] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[03:44:04] <sacho> there's no property "removeClass" of jquery collections.
[03:44:48] <sacho> Oh ok. There is. So, there's no property 'closest' of the function removeClass.
[03:44:58] <sacho> what are you trying to do?
[03:45:44] <sunbeam> I'm trying to remove the closest <span class="error">*</span> lying next to an <input> field which is validated
[03:49:53] <soee> any idea whats wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/HJxVKjax
[03:50:06] <NodeX> $(this).closest('error').remove();
[03:50:10] <soee> the form is loaded with ajax, filed name is ok
[03:50:14] <NodeX> $(this).closest('.error').remove();
[03:50:15] <soee> *id
[03:50:37] <sunbeam> ok thanks
[03:51:03] <NodeX> soee : $('body').on('keyup','#Movie_code',function(){....
[03:51:26] <sacho> soee, the form probably wasn't loaded when you executed that.
[03:52:19] <soee> sacho, yes it wasn't the JS code is in my page code and form is loaded later when user lick proper button
[03:52:28] <NodeX> [11:51:00] <NodeX> soee : $('body').on('keyup','#Movie_code',function(){....
[03:52:39] <soee> NodeX, yes that work
[03:52:54] <sunbeam> whats better, having a form with <span class="erorr">*</span hidden, and visible when in error?
[03:53:11] <sunbeam> or adding that with .after() (and making sure each time it exists only once)
[03:53:42] <NodeX> the former is quicker and uses less resources
[03:55:29] <soee> ok one more question can i in one regular expression check if input value match one of 3 possible strings ?
[03:55:49] <NodeX> sunbeam : what I do personaly is just add a red outline around the required field instead of an element near it when it's not filled in
[03:56:02] <NodeX> soee : yes
[03:56:05] <soee> so when user paste link from youtube input value should be check and 'youtube' string found
[03:56:10] <NodeX> "|" <-- pipe operator
[03:56:32] <soee> ok let me try
[03:57:43] <sunbeam> NodeX: yea but that doesn't fit in this design
[03:58:23] <sunbeam> NodeX: better would probably be, when the form submit is clicked, .each input, and add that error class
[03:58:31] <wathek> how would you do to show a tooltip with a zoomed image when hovered ?
[03:58:41] <NodeX> sunbeam : that's what I just said
[03:59:12] <norbi> guys, i try to use jquery ui dialog, and clicking on a link it opens, but after i click on the link, the page scrolls to top, even is i added .click(function(){ has this->>> return false; })
[03:59:14] <norbi> why?
[03:59:24] <some_dude> .width()/height() always return 0, what to do, WHAT TO DO?
[03:59:24] <soee> NodeX, any sample code to check if input value contains vimeo or youtube string ?
[03:59:33] <norbi> if*
[03:59:51] <NodeX> soee : plenty on google ;)
[04:02:53] <soee> how can i set element as selected on my list by its key value ?
[04:13:41] <some_dude> someone explain this to me: http://jsfiddle.net/vTNu2/3/
[04:14:45] <ENQ> is it posible to do selection like this object.select(":parent > div.block"), so it would select current element parent div child with class of block
[04:20:40] <martisj> mornign
[04:24:10] <olly_c>  some_dude: you need to put px at the end of the width value, i.e. 300px NOT 300
[04:27:45] <seutje> ENQ: object.parent().children('div.block') ?
[04:28:28] <ENQ> seutje, i could use that, but i wish i could use some function, then write rest in selector like i writed
[04:28:59] <rosieres> can somebody tell me what I am doing wrong with my arrays ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/gVztV/4/  outside the iteration the array is filled. within I only get first item. detailled console.log is on
[04:29:36] <seutje> ENQ: you'll have to extend it yourself then, I thinks
[04:30:00] <ENQ> probably, just saw :parent on site and thout i can use it with some functions
[04:30:01] <blackspotwiggins> ENQ, seutje why not siblings() ?
[04:30:17] <seutje> good point
[04:30:26] <ENQ> leme check
[04:31:21] <seutje> ENQ: ":parent' is used for elements that have child elements
[04:31:39] <seutje> (including text nodes)
[04:32:53] <ENQ> no siblings isnt working
[04:34:29] <sacho> rosieres, Why are you using an array as an index to your arrays inside?
[04:35:48] <some_dude> olly_c:  im such a fuckking idiot... thanks
[04:37:55] <rosieres> sacho: I´m still in learning stadium. Think I missed sth. whats the way to do it better ?
[04:38:27] <ENQ> so there is no such thing like :parent selector? ;/
[04:38:53] <some_dude> ENQ:  $(element).parent()
[04:39:20] <sacho> rosieres, what is menuindex in the loop?
[04:40:03] <ENQ> some_dude, maybe something like $(element).select(":parent")?
[04:40:06] <rosieres> sacho: should be the position of the item within the array
[04:40:16] <sacho> It's not.
[04:40:19] <sacho> it's an array.
[04:41:02] <olly_c> some_dude: no problems
[04:41:27] <rosieres> sacho: with every iteration I push an item to the array outside the loop.  I thought this would be right...
[04:41:28] <seutje> ENQ: yea, there is, but it's for selecting elements that have children (including textNode children)
[04:41:38] <seutje> ENQ: not for traversing to the parent of the current element
[04:42:23] <sacho> rosieres, you have a logical problem with your code. Look through it again and think about what is happening.
[04:43:17] <ENQ> i see seutje
[04:45:17] <shoky> ENQ siblings should work
[04:46:10] <ENQ> ill solve it other way then, no need to strech :D
[04:46:23] <shoky> huh? siblings is what you asked for
[04:46:25] <rosieres> sacho: Thank you !! . . .  I reread the api to each() and understood.
[04:46:39] <rosieres> sacho:http://jsfiddle.net/gVztV/6/
[04:46:55] <ENQ> shoky, no they  dont work
[04:47:01] <shoky> well, siblings wouldnt select the current element if you need it
[04:47:22] <ruby_on_tails> :D
[04:47:32] <ENQ> i have a button, i need to get its parent, and then that parent child with some class
[04:47:35] <shoky> but .parent().children() is just fine then. much nicer than cramming it all up into some gross selector
[04:48:18] <shoky> ENQ: if the button is not one of the elements you're looking for, then siblings should work fine
[04:48:19] <ENQ> still would like it to be configurable, will just add selector for closest and children
[04:58:03] <kian_> Question: Attempting to bind a click event to a dropdown select, on "click" it makes changes to the select's options.  Hunky dory on Webkit/FF, keeps closing the dropdown on IE.
[04:59:02] <kian_> Any idea which event I can bind to so I can make the changes before the dropdown shows?
[05:14:03] <Pitel_laptop> i have problem... I have kind of template in my html code: <script>var template = $("<div>");</script>. I my js scripts, I make .clone() of this template first and thanwork with this cloned object. the thing is it is not isolated. wtf?
[05:15:32] <ENQ> umm, i cant change instace object parameters from prototyped function? can i? form Something.prototype.options = function(){this.options = {some value}}
[05:24:35] <kian_> I think there's a cup of tea for me when I get this set of changes done.
[05:24:40] <kian_> #excitinglife
[05:27:49] <Lucky--> http://www.andymatthews.net/read/2012/03/27/jQuery-Mobile-Autocomplete-now-available very cool
[05:48:00] <ENQ> if someone could look, http://fiddle.jshell.net/HnWb2/, my this.options is wrong, all instances got same last instance options, _fix_url and _fix_content functions
[05:49:25] <lathan> you talking about in the Fetchy function ?
[05:49:34] <Lucky--> http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox2/demos/install.html <--- anyone got this thing to work, ive tested it in droid/iOS :-( or got a recommendation for a good mobile datepicker"
[05:49:37] <ENQ> yes lathan they are called there
[05:50:49] <ENQ> the strange thing, that this.$parent is different in all instances, which is set in _fix_content
[05:51:01] <lathan> ENQ can you make your fiddle page demonstrate the error?
[05:51:02] <ENQ> i dont understand something about this prototype..
[05:51:14] <ENQ> gime a sec
[05:51:20] <lathan> I haven't done a lot with prototype but I can try...
[05:51:30] <lathan> and make sure to set the framework to jQuery
[05:51:35] <lathan> so it will actually run
[05:51:48] <sunbeam> how can i prevent users from being able to submit a form with pressing enter?
[05:51:53] <sunbeam> only by clicking the button
[05:52:31] <lathan> sunbeam, you can bind to the form submit event.preventDefault()
[05:53:05] <lathan> sunbeam, then bind to the submit click and do an ajax call, or trigger the form submit with a flag in the data that says it was a submit
[05:54:23] <lathan> $('form').submit(function(e,data){
[05:54:23] <lathan> if(data == 1){ // let the form submit
[05:54:23] <lathan> return true;
[05:54:23] <lathan> }
[05:54:23] <lathan> e.preventDefault();
[05:54:24] <lathan> // or return false
[05:54:24] <lathan> });
[05:54:25] <b-ot> lathan, falsy values in js: null, undefined, NaN, false, zero ( the number 0 - "0" is true ), "" ( empty string )
[05:54:25] <lathan> $('input:submit
[05:54:41] <sunbeam> lathan: thanks!
[05:54:46] <sunbeam> but
[05:54:46] <lathan> np
[05:54:59] <sunbeam> how data gets 1?
[05:55:01] <lathan> I didn't type all that in....(probably shouldn't type any of that)
[05:55:02] <shoky> ENQ: your Fetchy expects the 2nd argument 'options' to be an object of options, no? but you're sending in an array of arguments
[05:55:25] <lathan> $('input:submit').click(function(){ $('form').trigger('submit',1);  e.preventDefault(); })
[05:55:29] <ENQ> shoky, i dont send anything for know, so idk it it works
[05:55:40] <lathan> sunbeam, you trigger the form submit with the 1 in the data argument
[05:55:50] <shoky> ENQ:  $.data(this, 'fetchy', _fetchy = new Fetchy(this, args) );
[05:55:59] <ENQ> here it is, http://fiddle.jshell.net/HnWb2/1/ press button, in firebug element->options->urls
[05:56:43] <shoky> ENQ: you are doing  $.extend(true, arrayOfStrings, defaults)
[05:57:12] <sunbeam> lathan: ah didnt see that, great
[05:57:19] <lathan> I didn't have it yet
[05:57:23] <lathan> accidentally pressed enter
[05:57:24] <ENQ> shoky, so this migh break something :S
[05:57:36] <ENQ> me try fix
[05:57:39] <shoky> ENQ: it doesn't make much sense
[05:58:04] <ENQ> changed it to new Fetchy(this, args[0])
[05:59:01] <shoky> ok, so something is still not good?
[05:59:39] <ENQ> changed this.options to this.opts and fixed that, know it works
[05:59:44] <ENQ> how weird
[06:00:21] <ENQ> $.extend(true, arrayOfStrings, defaults) can this mess up such thing like setting instance parameters?
[06:00:53] <shoky> what do you expect it to do?
[06:01:17] <shoky> jQuery.extend( [deep], target, object1 [, objectN] )
[06:01:26] <shoky> targetThe object to extend. It will receive the new properties.
[06:01:35] <ENQ> target second?
[06:01:46] <ENQ> going to check docs :D
[06:02:01] <ENQ> god damn it
[06:02:24] <Cryp71c> I am looping through a set of objects using .each(function() { }); but there is a variable above all this that I need to have access to within the function() { } call...how can I get access to that global variable?
[06:02:47] <ENQ> know it works..
[06:02:50] <lathan> Cryp71c, you already have it
[06:02:52] <shoky> Cryp71c: you just access it regularly
[06:02:52] <ENQ> thanks again man
[06:03:01] <lathan> Cryp71c, functions inherit scope from what calls it
[06:03:30] <lathan> var foo="a"; $('form').each(function(){ alert(this.src + "  = " + foo); });
[06:04:40] <shoky> ENQ: i hope you're not doing:  $.extend(true, defaults, options)
[06:05:10] <ENQ> shoky, na was better options = $.extend(true, options, defaults)
[06:05:25] <shoky> k
[06:05:36] <lathan> ENQ, shoky does extend return the merged object?
[06:05:39] <lathan> ?extend
[06:05:50] <lathan> bot-t: are you there?
[06:05:55] <shoky> lathan yeah
[06:06:04] <ENQ> but had problem while setting other options in later code, and oll instances was overwrited by last options
[06:06:13] <lathan> shoky, wasn't sure if it modified the object or created a new one
[06:06:27] <shoky> it modifies the target
[06:06:32] <shoky> and also returns it
[06:06:35] <lathan> ah
[06:06:35] <ENQ> thanks again guys
[06:06:47] <lathan> that's probably ENQ's problem
[06:07:01] <lathan> its modifying the global object instead of the one instance of it
[06:07:03] <shoky> if he was calling it on an array, yeah
[06:07:15] <humanite_> heya,
[06:07:19] <shoky> but it's not a global object in his case
[06:07:20] <lathan> hi
[06:07:23] <lathan> true
[06:07:35] <shoky> but you're right, he should do $.extend(true, {}, options, defaults)  to be safe
[06:07:39] <shoky> ENQ ^^
[06:07:56] <humanite_> how can i access the main window from a ui dialog
[06:08:17] <shoky> a ui dialog is part of the main window
[06:08:22] <shoky> so... window ?
[06:08:37] <lathan> humanite_, a ui dialog is not an iframe
[06:09:00] <humanite_> ok, but how can i stop nthen a ajax request when the dialog opens?
[06:09:11] <shoky> ;S
[06:09:36] <humanite_> it like a confirm()
[06:10:00] <lathan> humanite_, do you want to stop an ajax request? or just do a confirm before making an ajax?
[06:10:43] <humanite_> i want to stop the ajax request
[06:12:19] <shoky> which one is that
[06:12:38] <lathan> humanite_, first of all, have you looked at the demo page for the modal confirmation? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[06:13:08] <lathan> humanite_, once in that function you just have to have the ajax request object in the parent scope and call xhr.abort()
[06:13:17] <stack> hello http://pastebin.com/m46dDU8D I'm using this script to fade in a random image when it loads, the problem is that in ie<=8 the onload event is not fired, what could be the problem?
[06:13:32] <lathan> humanite_, but I really think you want to delay starting the ajax until the confirm
[06:13:39] <stack> I'm structuring the script that way to avoid cache issues, if there is a better way let me know.
[06:13:45] <lathan> humanite_, so I think you want to move the ajax call into the function for the accept button
[06:14:25] <seutje> lathan: first off, it's better to use event binders instead of setting the onload
[06:14:34] <seutje> lathan: second, you might want to look into imageLoaded()
[06:14:39] <seutje> imagesLoaded()*
[06:14:45] <lathan> seutje, ...talk to stack...not me
[06:14:53] <stack> yes I noticed :)
[06:15:06] <stack> seutje: imagesLoaded, what is it?
[06:15:09] <humanite_> ok, lathan
[06:15:10] <lathan> plugin
[06:15:13] <seutje> lathan: surri
[06:15:15] <seutje> stack: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[06:15:18] <lathan> np
[06:15:38] <seutje> stack: it's designed to handle both cached images, images that fail to load and regular ones (iirc)
[06:16:52] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Tutorial: Create A jQuery Mobile Picture Uploader To Amazon S3  http://t.co/F6n0gPo8 â˜… http://bit.ly/NXDKBR
[06:17:14] <seutje> stack: as a side note: using things like foo.onLoad = function() {} or similar things will overwrite any handlers already defined, consider using jquery's .on() or a similar method
[06:17:38] <lathan> oi....I got to get used to 1.7's event handlers as opposed to 1.4
[06:17:47] <stack> seutje: ok I'm aware of that anyway
[06:18:01] <stack> I'm using 1.4 btw
[06:18:14] <lathan> so still bind, trigger, delegate
[06:20:02] <seutje> lathan: same, but most frontend work I do is in drupal, so... yea...
[06:22:00] <sunbeam> $(this).closest('span.error').fadeIn("slow");
[06:22:05] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this, any idea?
[06:23:54] <lathan> sunbeam, without context, I would guess its the "this"
[06:24:14] <lathan> or the "fadeIn" (capital i)
[06:24:24] <lathan> oh...nvmind
[06:24:27] <sunbeam> fadeIn is correct
[06:24:33] <sunbeam> yes, but closest should simply just get the nearest .error right?
[06:24:52] <lathan> closest matches the selector on [this, this.parents]
[06:24:59] <lathan> jsfiddle example?
[06:25:31] <sunbeam> ehm actually its a <li><input><span class="error">*</span></li>
[06:25:33] <sunbeam> <input> is this
[06:25:59] <lathan> there's your problem
[06:26:03] <lathan> .closest looks to parents
[06:26:06] <lathan> not descendents
[06:26:18] <lathan> $(this).children() or $(this).find()
[06:26:32] <lathan> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:26:51] <lathan> closest goes up the tree to find parents, find goes down the tree to find children
[06:27:01] <sunbeam> ahh great
[06:27:08] <sunbeam> but technically in my case this isnt children() right?
[06:27:21] <lathan> oh
[06:27:28] <lathan> either siblings
[06:27:32] <lathan> or .parent().find()
[06:27:51] <lathan> $(this).next()
[06:27:58] <lathan> $(this).nextAll('span.error')
[06:28:02] <hoolter>  /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER hoolter wqpszikggtun
[06:28:11] <lathan> $(this).siblings('span.next')
[06:28:14] <hoolter> whoops, sorry! :(
[06:28:18] <lathan> hoolter, your msg just went public
[06:28:19] <lathan> lol
[06:28:36] <hoolter> lathan: mah, that's ok.
[06:28:41] <hoolter> nothing sensitive, as you can see.
[06:28:42] <sunbeam> lathan: ok thanks ill check it
[06:28:46] <hoolter> ciao.
[06:31:15] <rosieres> how would I write this corrctly ? Can I mix this up ? $(window).resize || $(window).scroll (function(){};
[06:31:44] <sunbeam> $(form).on('change', ':checkbox', function() { .. }
[06:31:51] <blackspotwiggins> rosieres, $(window).on("resize scroll", function() {})
[06:31:57] <sunbeam> can i apply this for input[type=text] fields aswell?
[06:31:58] <sunbeam> like
[06:31:59] <rosieres> thx !!
[06:32:02] <lathan> rosieres, $(window).bind('resize scroll')
[06:32:06] <sunbeam> $(form).on('change', 'input[type=text]', function() {
[06:32:23] <lathan> $(window).on('resize scroll', function(){
[06:32:50] <lathan> sunbeam, can't see why not
[06:32:53] <sunbeam> ok
[06:33:19] <lathan> sunbeam, probably do them together even: 'input:checkbox, input:[type=text]'
[06:33:27] <lathan> sky is the limit
[06:35:55] <Ergo^> hey guys, im binding to onSubmit event, and in internet explorer my form.elements.length is 0 - it works in all other browsers - any ideas ?
[06:37:16] <seutje> Ergo^: are they visible?
[06:37:17] <faraway> Ergo^: why don't you use $(form).find("input,textarea").length ?
[06:37:31] <lathan> faraway, don't forget select
[06:37:52] <lathan> faraway, and that messes with the order of the form fields. sometimes you really want to keep the order of the form fields
[06:38:40] <makin> Hi, i have to make a trigger that is executed when the user has stayed for 10 seconds. So, I have to detect the time in the page. How i can do it?
[06:38:44] <faraway> lathan: thought jquery's output is document order. has this changed ?
[06:39:02] <lathan> makin, define "stayed for 10 seconds"
[06:39:16] <lathan> makin, do you mean like before they click away?
[06:39:22] <Ergo^> seutje, yeah they are visible, im not even using jquery, this is general IE/quirk question
[06:39:39] <lathan> faraway, but if you do $('input, textarea') then it first grabs all the inputs (in doc order), but then after that all the textareas are added afterwards
[06:40:14] <seutje> Ergo^: what are you trying to do, exactly?
[06:40:19] <lathan> the comma selector means doig this var list = [ doc.getElementsByTag('input'),doc.getElementsByTag('select'),doc.getElementsByTag('textarea') ]
[06:40:27] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks. I'm not sure where else to ask this on IRC, and I figure there are some really brilliant folks in here, so...
[06:40:27] <seutje> might you be looking for serialize?
[06:40:35] <jonathancutrell> I'm all for open source. But what are the right steps to prevent copyright infringement of a website by someone from a different country?
[06:40:49] <seutje> block said country :D
[06:40:52] <makin> lathan, after the page is loaded. For example, once user enter in the website and stay 10 seconds in the same view, I want to print something.
[06:41:03] <Ergo^> seutje, ok i know, the <form> tag was actually <form /> tag :/
[06:41:05] <Ergo^> typo
[06:41:07] <faraway> lathan: sure, when i tested a while before this where sorted, i even copied the code out of query cause i needed it for another project
[06:41:21] <jonathancutrell> Our site, http://whiteboard.is , was literally copied directly (and offers the "copying" of sites they didn't make as a service) - http://dandier.co.uk
[06:41:43] <seutje> Ergo^: ah, odd that other browsers figured it out for you
[06:42:27] <blackspotwiggins> jonathancutrell, lawyer up, hit the gym, delete facebook
[06:43:09] <lathan> jonathancutrell, you can do obfuscation on resources, but if it is copyrighted, then don't put it on the web
[06:43:32] <lathan> you can minify and zip up javascript, you can watermark images....but....
[06:44:02] <jonathancutrell> lathan: Clearly that's not a complete solution to the problem.
[06:44:03] <seutje> jonathancutrell: just publicly call them out. Don't underestimate the power of public humiliation
[06:44:12] <seutje> jonathancutrell: there is none
[06:44:20] <lathan> hey seutje, you know how to use the queue to run your own custom functions? how do you use delay instead of setTimeout
[06:44:28] <jonathancutrell> seutje lathan I figured that was probably the case.
[06:44:36] <lathan> jonathancutrell, sorry....
[06:44:53] <jonathancutrell> lathan - No worries. We aren't worried about it as much as we are curious. :)
[06:45:04] <makin> lathan, i have this code but don't work as I want: http://jsfiddle.net/D8kzd/
[06:45:23] <lathan> makin, what's wrong?
[06:45:28] <rosieres> how can I check if an element is some pixel out of the viewport, note completely, only with e.g. 20px out of viewport of 200px . the remaining 180px are in viewport.
[06:46:08] <lathan> rosieres, plugin or calculations: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4726030/jquery-how-to-detect-if-an-item-is-currently-outside-of-the-viewport
[06:46:15] <lathan> rosieres, http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/
[06:47:05] <lathan> makin, are you wanting to show a timer?
[06:47:52] <makin> lathan, I only want to detect if 10ms has passed.
[06:48:02] <lathan> 10 ms?
[06:48:07] <lathan> just use setTimeout
[06:48:21] <lathan> setTimeout(function(){ alert('10 ms has passed!!!');},10);
[06:48:24] <rosieres> as far as I understand this only detects if an element is completely in or completely out. but my problem is that an item could run only a few pixel out of it, which I want to correct
[06:48:35] <seutje> lathan: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1058158/can-somebody-explain-jquery-queue-to-me scroll down to the "another custom queue example"
[06:48:41] <lathan> makin, but bewarned, 10 ms isn't that long, people could be in the process of loading the new page
[06:49:01] <lathan> ty a bunch seutje
[06:49:31] <makin> ok thx lathan!
[06:49:37] <faraway> lathan: do you have a link to the docs which confirms you statement with the sort order, cause i looked at the Sizzle docs and the jquery source right now and both indicate that the result is in document order. i don't want to be opinionated, it's just i want to know whats definitely right (it's something important to know for me)
[06:49:57] <makin> just oen problem, i have to create lot of timeouts cuz i have to wait lot of times...
[06:50:09] <lathan> faraway, I have found it in my experience. but I can create an example
[06:50:28] <lathan> makin, timeouts are probably cheap
[06:50:45] <makin> for example: 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 22 seconds ..., aha ok
[06:50:55] <makin> there isn't a better way?
[06:51:32] <makin> lathan, don't worry it0s ok for me
[06:51:37] <shadykhan> whats the best way to fade an element out , then once its gone remove its class and then fade it back in?
[06:51:47] <lathan> makin, you could have one interval at say ... 1000 ms, that checks an array to handle the next timer
[06:52:44] <makin> i will try both options.
[06:54:11] <shoky> shadykhan: $(element).fadeOut( function() { $(this).removeClass('someclass').fadeIn() )
[06:54:20] <shadykhan> thank you
[06:54:32] <faraway> lathan: if you know an example where it is not ordered it would be great to see. hopefully it is then just a jquery thing :D
[06:54:54] <shadykhan> shoky, and how can i make it so if the user spams the button it wont keep repeating?
[06:55:04] <lathan> faraway, my apologies, they fixed it in version 1.3
[06:55:15] <lathan> faraway, it only fails in 1.2.6 http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/8Y2BY/
[06:55:40] <shoky> shadykhan: you can put $(element).stop().fadeOut(..
[06:56:05] <shoky> stop(true)
[06:56:11] <faraway> lathan: np, i currently was not sure  if i'm right thats why i asked
[06:56:26] <lathan> faraway, here's a better way showing of it: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/8Y2BY/1/
[06:56:40] <lathan> but in 1.3+ they fixed it
[06:56:50] <lathan> good thing I learned that...thanks faraway
[06:58:35] <cj101> hi. just a quick question. what does anyone think of this for an extention to jquery? -> http://pastebin.com/VpS46tS5 <- doesnt do elements only ids but i was getting annoyed with not being able to get the selected value of a select box
[06:59:42] <jonathancutrell> cj101: Certainly doesn't need to be on jQuery.prototype
[06:59:49] <Ergo^> seutje, anyways, this didnt fix it, trying to do it outside onSubmit (from console) works fine, it just gets empty on onSubmit :(
[07:00:16] <cj101> Jonadabe, si there a better way to add that function to the jQuery object?
[07:00:24] <faraway> lathan: and i'm reassured that it is document ordered otherwise, it would have been a stressful weekend :D
[07:00:29] <cj101> sorry i ment jonathancutrell ^
[07:00:49] <jonathancutrell> cj101: jQuery.whatever = function(args){ }
[07:00:59] <cj101> oh ok then
[07:01:01] <jonathancutrell> cj101: or jQuery.fn.whatever = function()
[07:01:21] <jonathancutrell> cj101: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[07:01:49] <sahbeewah> you can use .prop to get the selectedIndex
[07:02:14] <jonathancutrell> cj101: You'll want to probably get a better understanding of how chaining and the selector engine works with plugin authoring.
[07:02:26] <cj101> jQuery.whatever = function(args){ } doesnt work but the fn one did
[07:02:26] <jonathancutrell> cj101: Also, what sahbeewah
[07:02:28] <jonathancutrell> said
[07:02:50] <jonathancutrell> cj101: jQuery.whatever = function() would be called with jQuery.whatever(arguments);
[07:03:18] <jonathancutrell> cj101: jQuery.fn.something would be called with $(selector).something()
[07:03:20] <cj101> cool, thanks, i think i get it. ill remember that
[07:07:32] <lathan> you can also say $(this).parent().children().index(this)
[07:07:43] <lathan> or is selectedIndex actuall user cursor / selection?
[07:08:41] <lathan> making, here's the timer idea: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/D8kzd/14/
[07:08:46] <lathan> makin, ^
[07:09:48] <makin> lathan, thank you. I have done this one: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/D8kzd/14/
[07:10:13] <lathan> makin, np...btw...that is the link I gave
[07:10:28] <makin> http://jsfiddle.net/D8kzd/13/ :)
[07:11:19] <lathan> makin, you have to be careful because exact ms values are very hard to get spot on
[07:11:36] <lathan> if you see the console, I don't think they all fire
[07:12:13] <lathan> makin, use a >= instead of a ==. http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/D8kzd/15/
[07:12:23] <makin> ok thank you!
[07:13:05] <lathan> makin, you may want to make a function that adds them in. if you want to create new timers on the fly (the start time could be different...so calculating the ms times is a little more work)
[07:13:37] <makin> lathan, don't worry i get the idea and your code. Thank you for all
[07:13:38] <lathan> newTimer(delay,func){ timers.push(currTime + delay, func) }
[07:13:44] <lathan> np makin, have fun
[07:14:41] <dean[w]> I have a [object HTMLImageElement] in my code, that i need to append to a list (obviously) within a list item. If i do $("ul").append("<li>" + img + "</li>"); it outputs <li>[object HTMLImageElement]</li>. How can i fix this?
[07:14:57] <zsoc> Ok this should be simple but I'm missing something. I'm trying to use datepicker to match an <option to the current month and add .append the 'selected' arg to it
[07:15:23] <faraway> dean[w]: $("ul").append($("<li>").append(img));
[07:15:31] <lathan> dean[w], use $(img).wrap('<li>')
[07:16:12] <lathan> zsoc, $('#select option:selected')
[07:20:53] <textchimp> can anyone recommend a good library for manipulating canvas layers (particularly their blending) in a GIMP/PS - like way?
[07:22:17] <zsoc> lathan: wait, I don't think date picker is what I want.... I just want to get the month and then append the matching option named with the arg... so do i just like date = new Date(); month = date.getMonth(); and then $('.month option:selected') and just make sure the <option's are in a class named by month?
[07:23:05] <lathan> zsoc, seems alright
[07:23:16] <zsoc> rubbin duckin alll day
[07:24:10] <faraway> textchimp: did you already look at jCanvas ?
[07:25:10] <faraway> textchimp: i don't know if it has this features, it just one that came in my mind right now
[07:31:07] <benedikt> does a form need to have a submit button for $("#form").submit() to work?
[07:32:23] <faraway> benedikt: i think some browsers require. i think i had the situation where it didn't work without one
[07:35:27] <textchimp> faraway: thanks, i'll check it out
[07:38:47] <lathan> benedikt, one option is to not actually use the form, but stop the form submit and do an ajax request instead
[07:39:29] <benedikt> lathan: oh, that sounds nice. i haven't touched web development since the days of netscape and GIFs
[07:39:32] <textchimp> faraway: this looks nice, it has layer support but not much in the way of how to handle blending between layers...
[07:39:37] <benedikt> i have *heard* about ajax though
[07:39:44] <lathan> benedikt, just don't try it with upload fields...they are a pain
[07:39:56] <benedikt> dasmmit
[07:39:57] <benedikt> dammit*
[07:40:08] <lathan> lol
[07:40:32] <benedikt> never before has a dream been conjured so easily, and killed so swiftly.
[07:40:46] <lathan> benedikt, what is your goal? to submit without the page loading?
[07:41:05] <faraway> textchimp: i know it is extendable, probably it is not so much to extend it with this feature, not sure what canvas supports out of the box
[07:41:10] <lathan> benedikt, you can use plugins that will make an iframe and have the form submit into the iframe.....http://www.ajaxf1.com/tutorial/ajax-file-upload-tutorial.html
[07:41:13] <lathan> http://www.ajaxf1.com/tutorial/ajax-file-upload-tutorial.html
[07:41:22] <benedikt> not really, i just have to process the input (digitally sign it) before sending it off. and somes pdf files will be uploaded.
[07:41:43] <lathan> benedikt, well, you can catch the submit event...monkey with the fields and then let it submit
[07:41:43] <zsoc> hmm.. wait how do i check getMonth() against a class name if css doesn't have classes that start with numbers?
[07:42:02] <lathan> zsoc, $('option.month' + month)
[07:42:12] <lathan> (with month being your month variable
[07:42:13] <lathan> )
[07:42:21] <benedikt> right now there is just a button that fires upp javascript/jquery and processes it and then submits the form. it would be better to catch the submit event i think
[07:42:29] <benedikt> but now i'm sold on this ajax thing
[07:42:34] <lathan> lol
[07:42:37] <alanroemen> lol
[07:42:42] <textchimp> faraway: yes, that might be the thing to do... you can do whatever you want with setPixels()
[07:43:09] <lathan> benedikt, if you really want it, you can look up and try some jquery upload plugins....
[07:43:18] <lathan> but they are more focused on the files with less other fields
[07:43:22] <benedikt> probably will
[07:43:37] <lathan> you seem to be more focused on the fields (and happen to have the uploads included)
[07:43:50] <zsoc> lathan: I'm sorry, I don't understand how option.month works in this case
[07:43:52] <benedikt> lathan: its either a plaintext field or a file upload field
[07:43:53] <faraway> textchimp: but i would first look if there is a native method in canvas for blending, custom calculations for blending with get/set Pixels are really expensive
[07:43:57] <benedikt> i just havent gotten to the pdf part yet
[07:44:05] <lathan> zsoc, option class="month1"
[07:44:08] <lathan> month2
[07:44:09] <lathan> month3
[07:44:15] <lathan> "month" + date.getMonth()
[07:44:52] <textchimp> faraway: yes, good point. where would i look? the standard for html5 you mean?
[07:44:53] <zsoc> ohhhhh thank you!
[07:45:00] <Mart_> Hello all, anyone knows how i can check if a variable have several objects in them?
[07:46:04] <faraway> textchimp: a quick search gave me this https://github.com/Phrogz/context-blender  so i thing there is no native method ;)
[07:46:54] <textchimp> faraway: i also found this, someone did a blending extension to the Pixastic canvas library: http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2009/01/photoshop-blend-modes-with-pixastic.html
[07:47:13] <textchimp> faraway: there is also some pretty nice webGL blending, i guess it's the fastest ;-)
[07:47:20] <textchimp> http://www.andersriggelsen.dk/glblendfunc.php
[07:48:09] <lathan> Mart_, you mean like does { a : "foo", b: "bar" } have "bar" in it?
[07:48:11] <faraway> textchimp: yes that would be probably the better solution, with glsl you would get much faster resuls
[07:48:54] <jedimind> ugh
[07:48:59] <jedimind> zombie mode today, so tired
[07:49:48] <Mart_> @ lathan yes! I want to make a function that does x if there is 1 object in it (only a f.e.), and i want to do y if there are serveral objects in it
[07:49:49] <b-ot> Mart_, memorised â€œthereâ€.
[07:49:54] <b-ot> Mart_, a question
[07:50:17] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have two text input fields, and one function triggered using .click() - the function inserts a value in one of the two text input field, alternating between the first and the second. What's the best way to keep track of this alternation?
[07:50:56] <Brodingo> ?toggle
[07:51:05] <lathan> bot-t is down
[07:51:07] <Brodingo> >:|
[07:51:08] <textchimp> faraway: but less supported, for now...
[07:51:26] <Brodingo> curse you robot devil
[07:51:30] <Brodingo> you took him too soon
[07:51:44] <lathan> lol
[07:51:49] <zsoc> lathan: great, i just used attr. to add selected. works perfectly :) thanks
[07:52:00] <lathan> np
[07:52:02] <margle> so; it seems my events are being removed when I call .html()
[07:52:18] <lathan> Mart_, there is no specific jQuery way to do that
[07:52:44] <lathan> Mart_, and really no easy way to do it in regular javascript. look at the answer to this stackoverfow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4992383/use-jquerys-find-on-json-object
[07:53:00] <lathan> majd, http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CGYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2Ftoggle%2F&ei=xVkRULWgNIm8rQHC84D4Bg&usg=AFQjCNGiXJSQEIu9ZI5hjngqbTYaL5OB9g&sig2=uMOgNmDyBytSt1vDWerBGA
[07:53:03] <lathan> oops
[07:53:05] <faraway> textchimp: yes .. depends on what you want to do, and if it you can restrict the user group to the ones with newer browsers
[07:53:13] <lathan> sorry about that huge link
[07:53:18] <lathan> Mart_, http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[07:53:38] <Mart_> lathan: thanks! I knew it was basic js, but i was not able to google it
[07:54:29] <lathan> np
[07:54:41] <majd_> sorry, browser crash! someone mentioned .toggle(), but i don't think that applies, because i'm not working on visibility
[07:55:17] <lathan> majd_, there are 2 different toggles
[07:55:22] <lathan> .toggle(function, function)
[07:55:34] <lathan> is different then $('div').toggle('slow')
[07:55:52] <lathan> sorry, I sent the wrong one
[07:56:03] <lathan> majd_, this one: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[07:56:39] <lathan> majd_, that event toggle lets you set up a queue of functions the cycle through whenever a click happens
[07:59:29] <majd_> lathan: ha! i think that's what i'm looking for. Thank you!
[08:01:15] <lathan> np
[08:05:17] <rayzer> When I do a jQuery.get() to do an HTTP get, are the cookies returned received by the browser automatically? If not, how do I get them to be?
[08:06:33] <rayzer> for some reason, I can't seem to find anyone addressing this issue in the search engines
[08:08:11] <rayzer> is there anyone actually here?
[08:08:20] <lathan> yes
[08:09:58] <CopyPastry> yep
[08:10:01] <faraway> no
[08:10:25] <rayzer> When I do a jQuery.get() to do an HTTP get, are the cookies returned received by the browser automatically? If not, how do I get them to be?
[08:13:51] <lathan> rayzer, they should be.... just in document.cookie...but I haven't done a ton with javascript and cookies
[08:16:00] <rayzer> lathan: what if my jQuery get() request was to a different domain though?
[08:16:23] <rayzer> those cookies aren't going to be accessbile to me in my script, but I need to know if they are getting set
[08:16:26] <lathan> rayzer, then you run into cross domain security
[08:16:54] <lathan> rayzer, are you actually handling the cross domain-ness right? is the request going?
[08:16:54] <fRAiLtY-> if dayCount is a variable how do I just add an integer to it, is it as simple as dayCount +1
[08:16:55] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[08:17:06] <lathan> rayzer, have you tried firebug console to see the ajax requests?
[08:17:12] <majd_>  this is more of javascript understanding in general than jquery in particular, but how can i access 'this' in add_coords when it's triggered using the .toggle() function??
[08:17:14] <majd_> http://dpaste.org/pIcwq/
[08:17:20] <rayzer> lathan: what I am working on is only in the idea stage
[08:17:24] <lathan> fRAiLtY-, dayCount += 5;
[08:18:02] <rayzer> I just need to know if the browser will remember cookies set from a jQuery HTTP get
[08:18:13] <rayzer> I don't need to access those cookies from my script
[08:18:19] <aniasis> hello
[08:18:35] <lathan> rayzer, try firebug console and look at the ajax request it will show cookies in the headers
[08:18:36] <lathan> hi
[08:19:09] <rayzer> good idea... so: you're not sure is the answer to my question
[08:19:10] <aniasis> ajpiano: jQmobile isn't initializing in an iframe that I am loading on the same page.
[08:19:20] <ajpiano> aniasis: you know what i hate
[08:19:23] <aniasis> even though I have all the jQmob call there
[08:19:24] <ajpiano> well, hated
[08:19:26] <faraway> rayzer: i think it is like if you include an image form a different domain on your page which tries to set a cookie
[08:19:32] <lathan> jQuery moble?
[08:19:35] <aniasis> ajpiano, no
[08:19:38] <ajpiano> the way that you used to come into this channel and instead of asking a question to the channel
[08:19:46] <ajpiano> you'd specifically direct it to john resig
[08:19:51] <ajpiano> the fact that you've changed that habit
[08:19:53] <ajpiano> to do it to me instead
[08:19:56] <ajpiano> doesn't make me any happier
[08:19:58] <lathan> lol
[08:20:02] <aniasis> lol!
[08:20:04] <rayzer> faraway: and what happens in that instance?
[08:20:12] <faraway> rayzer: so it depends on the browser and its settings if they are accepted. but i would not relay on it
[08:20:20] <aniasis> ajpiano, I would ask multiple times
[08:20:33] <ajpiano> that's how irc works
[08:20:40] <aniasis> then I would direct it to specific people because I felt because no one answered no one knew
[08:20:52] <faraway> rayzer: imho you can set the settings so that you 3rd party cookies cannot be set.
[08:20:58] <aniasis> no just resig or you.
[08:21:07] <aniasis> temp also
[08:21:15] <faraway> rayzer: about you could check if they are set, if you do the request twice and then check if the cookie is send to your server
[08:21:28] <aniasis> ajpiano: I felt we atleast had a repoire that I could do so.  But I will refrain
[08:21:33] <lathan> majd_, the "this" of a a function is a context of a function, jquery functions call a function and correctly set the "this" context with what was selected in the jQuery selector. so jQuery should be doing all the work for you for that.
[08:21:39] <ajpiano> aniasis: it's "rapport" ;)
[08:21:44] <aniasis> ;)
[08:21:49] <lathan> lol
[08:21:54] <aniasis> repoire is the french way
[08:21:59] <faraway> rayzer: and return true {"cookieAccepted":true} or something like thos. then you will at least know if it works and otherwise do a fallback
[08:22:02] <ajpiano> aniasis: no, rapport is the french way
[08:22:04] <lathan> ajpiano, do you know who can restart the bot?
[08:22:04] <aniasis> of spelling
[08:22:15] <aniasis> ajpiano, lay off me man!
[08:22:19] <lathan> aniasis, its not french if there aren't extra silent letters :)
[08:22:24] <ajpiano> aniasis: anyway, the point is
[08:22:30] <aniasis> I just need some assistance
[08:22:34] <rayzer> faraway:  is there any way you know of to access the Response cookies returned from a jQuery HTTP get?
[08:22:36] <ajpiano> when you want to like, ping an "expert" who you know is there
[08:22:39] <faraway> rayzer: damn .. to many typos .. hope you still understand what i sayed
[08:22:41] <ajpiano> at least say hi first and shoot the shit
[08:22:55] <aniasis> point taken
[08:22:56] <rayzer> faraway: I think I am following you
[08:22:58] <ajpiano> not just like HELLO I HVAE BUILT AN OUTPOST AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN AND THE HEATING IS OUT PLZ FIX
[08:23:09] <faraway> rayzer: do you have access to the server of the different domain
[08:23:17] <rayzer> faraway: no
[08:23:33] <aniasis> well I'm back!
[08:23:36] <faraway> rayzer: ok then you won't be able to check .. sorry
[08:23:56] <ajpiano> aniasis: furthermore at this point don't you know that like, it's better to provide a demo or code
[08:24:04] <ajpiano> instead of just telling a story about what's going on
[08:24:20] <aniasis> Yes
[08:24:54] <lathan> ajpiano, haha @ outpost
[08:25:10] <ajpiano> lathan: we don't control bot-t :(
[08:25:16] <lathan> shame
[08:25:17] <ajpiano> lathan: we are just working on a replacement for him
[08:25:24] <faraway> rayzer: ah there is one possibility to check if it would work
[08:25:25] <ajpiano> cause yeah, bummer that he just comes and goes as he fancies
[08:25:41] <lathan> you're replacing bot-t? how can you be so callused? lol
[08:25:43] <lathan> shame
[08:25:52] <lathan> ajpiano, well, I know if you say bot-t: bye he logs off
[08:25:56] <lathan> or ?bye
[08:26:07] <ajpiano> usually he crashes is what is going on, i think
[08:26:40] <lathan> ah
[08:26:48] <Aquaguy> Hey there!
[08:26:50] <lathan> I know I've shut him down once with that
[08:27:00] <faraway> rayzer: if you have the domain www.rayzer.tld, then you could send a request to cookiecheck.rayzer.net?set-cookie  where you set the cookie, then you do a second request  cookiecheck.rayzer.net?check-cookie where you return if the cookie was send with your request
[08:27:07] <rayzer> Here is the thing faraway, jQuery is actually doing a normal HTTP Request and receiving a normal HTTP Response... can I get access to the cookies of that response? I am all ears on the other possibility
[08:27:20] <Aquaguy> good morning, afternoon, evening whenever you are on your day
[08:27:32] <faraway> rayzer: then you know if the settings of the browser support cross domain cookie set .. but reading the cookie of a cross domain is still not possible
[08:27:47] <lathan> rayzer, try doing ajax.getAllResponseHeaders() and see what that does
[08:28:00] <lathan> just out of curiosity
[08:28:06] <Aquaguy> I'm trying to get the height of a image using jquery. The image has been resized using a jquery ui slider. img.height() returns 0.
[08:28:10] <rayzer> right as I say, I don't really need to read it... I only want to know it has been set so when I send the user over there directly, they have the cookie already
[08:28:17] <lathan> like var xhr = $.get('....')
[08:28:27] <rayzer> lathan: thanks! I'll check that!
[08:28:30] <lathan> rayzer, is this like some remote authentication thing?
[08:28:30] <Aquaguy> I don't want the real image height, but the resized height
[08:28:41] <lathan> rayzer, just make sure the success fires before you try to read those headers
[08:28:57] <lathan> rfc standards manuals can be helpful: http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060405/
[08:29:16] <majd_> lathan: hmmm - is it normal that $(this) 's value is window??
[08:29:25] <Aquaguy> anyone?
[08:29:48] <rayzer> lathan: this is an affiliate tracking thing... the landing page on the remote site that accepts the affilite identifier is a crappy page... want to send them directly in to a different page, but the session needs to be known by the remote site as having been sent by the right affiliate
[08:31:07] <lathan> majd_, no
[08:31:19] <lathan> majd_, but that is because this is undefined, and when you do $(undefined) you get window
[08:31:33] <lathan> majd_, is your func really being called by jQuery? jsfiddle code?
[08:32:01] <lathan> I have a problem with :has and 2 child-parent selectors with a comma: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/eBKE9/2/
[08:32:12] <lathan> :has(a b, a c)
[08:32:19] <majd_> lathan: let me quickly convert my dpaste into a jsfiddle example http://dpaste.org/pIcwq/
[08:32:24] <lathan> that don't work unless you do :has(a b), :has(a c)
[08:32:26] <lathan> majd_, ty
[08:32:43] <lathan> majd_, please select jQuery on the left as well....soo annoying when people don't get the jsfiddle working
[08:33:18] <lathan> anyone had a problem with the comma selector and the descendents selector interfering?
[08:36:33] <faraway> lathan: not that i could remember
[08:36:55] <lathan> well, I think I'm finding some issues with an invalid self-closing anchor tag
[08:37:01] <faraway> lathan: just had some problems with the > selector and .on()
[08:37:07] <dethkrieg> So on Google's calendar, when you input time, it's a text field, but it does nice validation, anyone know of an existing plugin that does this or if Google has a public one?
[08:37:24] <faraway> lathan: which browser ?
[08:37:49] <lathan> firefox
[08:38:00] <lathan> I was trying to do <a /> and it was messing up nth-child selectors
[08:38:17] <lathan> the a tag isn't supposed to self close
[08:38:42] <faraway> lathan:hmm â€¦ i know that IE has some problems with certain self-closing tags like <span />    where even the render engine gets totally confused
[08:38:52] <majd_> lathan: alright, here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/VF3Xn/
[08:39:50] <lathan> your inputs don't have the self closing tag @ majd_
[08:41:28] <lathan> majd_, you can't put add-cords(arg) in a toggle statement. then add_cords(arg) is evaluated at runtime, and not at the event
[08:41:50] <lathan> try function(){ add_cords('[name=one]') });
[08:42:13] <lathan> rayzer, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557602/jquery-and-ajax-response-header
[08:43:55] <fRAiLtY-> Theoretically, shouldn't the second select (eq(1)) add 2 to the day count that pre-exists making it 4? It doesn't it just makes it 2 again http://jsfiddle.net/t22xZ/9/
[08:44:42] <rayzer> thanks everyone! I have some things to investigate now!
[08:47:55] <lathan> majd_, okay...here is it fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/VF3Xn/4/
[08:48:11] <lathan> majd_, notice the function(){ add_coords.call(this,....})
[08:48:48] <lathan> majd_,  you need the function so it doesn't call add_coords before the event is fired, and you need the .call(this to pass on the this context
[08:50:13] <lathan> majd_, oh...and it'd be best if you use id selectors instead of [name=one]....
[08:50:43] <majd_> lathan: great explanation, thank you!
[08:51:42] <lathan> majd_, np
[08:51:45] <majd_> lathan: although, the toggle is only happening every 4th click, which is very strange...
[08:51:55] <lathan> what?
[08:51:57] <lathan> not on mine
[08:52:11] <lathan> oh wierd
[08:52:14] <lathan> it is
[08:52:44] <majd_> yeah...
[08:55:54] <aniasis> could someone help with my issue of jQmobile not initializing on the load of an iframe.  but if I load the iframe source independent of the parent page it loads fine.  An example could be found here...
[08:55:54] <aniasis> http://jsfiddle.net/CrStL/
[08:55:57] <lathan> majd_, in all reality, you probably don't want the toggle, because u and v should be the 1st coordinate and x and y are the 2nd? http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/VF3Xn/5/
[08:56:16] <lathan> bot-t: is it you?
[08:56:25] <lathan> shame
[08:56:35] <majd_> lathan: no, i want the first click to fill the first field, the second click to fill the second field
[08:57:06] <lathan> okay
[08:57:06] <lathan> hm
[08:57:20] <wesbos> lathan: lol oops, was goofin around somewhere else ;)
[08:59:03] <lathan> figured
[08:59:13] <lathan> careful with that...alot of places will ban you for having bot in your name
[08:59:27] <wesbos> orlly
[08:59:43] <lathan> wesbos, maybe not irc...but other chats
[08:59:50] <lathan> majd_, there: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/VF3Xn/6/
[09:01:19] <aniasis> ajpiano, hey how's it going?  Me, I'm fine.  You know I created that fiddle we were talking about earlier.  Care to look at it?  ;)
[09:01:34] <ajpiano> i didn't see the link sorry
[09:02:26] <majd_> lathan: are you sure? i'm still seeing the same behaviour
[09:02:34] <ajpiano> aniasis: um
[09:02:45] <ajpiano> you're trying to use jquery mobile and jquery tools together inside of an iframe?
[09:02:56] <lathan> majd_, let me just make sure it saved: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/VF3Xn/7/
[09:03:12] <lathan> woa....it was working..then it stopped
[09:03:31] <majd_> lolz
[09:03:34] <lathan> do a hard refresh majd_
[09:03:39] <lathan> its some wierd cache problem
[09:04:00] <lathan> ctrl+shift+r, ctrl+F5, shift+F5, whatever it is in your browser
[09:05:08] <majd_> opened it in an incognito window, still same behaviour
[09:05:11] <ikosen> I have a problem when using a jquery plugin (http://www.madeincima.it/en/articles/resources-and-tools/easy-accordion-plugin/) I have made a site based on that plugin, but it does not load correctly every time its loaded. The site it: www.ydefeldt.com/sd can someone see what the problem might be?
[09:06:43] <lathan> majd_, something wacky is going on with jsfiddle then....but the concept is sound
[09:06:44] <cohitre> ikosen: are you using any dev tools like firebug?
[09:07:10] <lathan> cyah guys later
[09:07:11] <cohitre> ikosen: if you were you could take a look at the console to see what error your page is raising
[09:07:58] <majd_> lathan_away: thanks for the help!!
[09:09:55] <aniasis> ajpiano not inside the iframe
[09:10:10] <ajpiano> aniasis: realistically i can't debug that situation right now, sorry
[09:10:13] <ajpiano> for stringing you along etc
[09:10:33] <ikosen> cohitre: I tried that but I dont see any errors...
[09:11:30] <ikosen> cohitre: Because you have to reload the site a dusin of times before the error come. It does not load the site correctly..
[09:11:33] <HassanS> ikosen neither do I.  Maybe switch the doctype to HTML5?
[09:12:09] <LindsayMac> dusin?
[09:12:31] <ikosen> Sometimes the site load like this: http://imgur.com/nOirN
[09:12:40] <ikosen> Which is not correct... :)
[09:12:41] <HassanS> she means dozen
[09:12:52] <LindsayMac> lol i know.. i found it funny
[09:12:58] <ikosen> yearh... sry..
[09:13:11] <textchimp> i'm not getting my $(document).load() event firing, is that still supposed to work?
[09:13:24] <ikosen> Caught up in danish...
[09:14:00] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok. you get a pass then
[09:14:14] <aniasis> ajpiano, arrgh well has anyone seen this error?
[09:14:28] <ajpiano> how am i supposed to know every error that other people have seen
[09:14:39] <HassanS> ikosen youre using jQuery 1.3.2 maybe a newer version would fix it
[09:15:03] <aniasis> c(a, "") is null on getComputedStyle?
[09:15:49] <ikosen> The thing that puzzles me is that it a periodic error...
[09:19:51] <JeffreyLevesque> is there jquery code that can turn off IE9 Compatibility Mode?
[09:19:52] <winux> hello.. i have an event.preventDefault() called on a form .submit action, and it gets hit, but right after validation takes place and the form is submitted anyways.. How do I prevent validation from submitting the form ?
[09:20:58] <shoky> winux: what validation?
[09:21:13] <winux> shoky: jquery validation
[09:21:26] <winux> shoky: on required fields, phoneUS, stuff like that
[09:23:44] <johnkpaul> JeffreyLevesque: no, there isn't, that's something you specifiy using that meta tag
[09:24:05] <JeffreyLevesque> thought so
[09:24:12] <JeffreyLevesque> ok thanks Johnkpaul
[09:24:26] <johnkpaul> np JeffreyLevesque
[09:26:53] <shoky> winux: did you try setting a submitHandler for the validation?
[09:28:38] <winux> shoky: i could try that route. I don't understand why preventDefault doesn't work however
[09:28:42] <aniasis> ajpiano, I figured out the problem
[09:29:22] <ajpiano> great!
[09:30:24] <shoky> winux: probably the validation plugin is re-submitting the form or something
[09:31:20] <shoky> winux: i seem to recall that it doesn't do it automatically if you set your own submitHandler. but maybe i'm thinking of a totally unrelated plugin
[09:32:02] <Aquaguy> I'm trying to get the height of a image using jquery. The image has been resized using a jquery ui slider. img.height() returns 0.
[09:32:09] <Aquaguy> I don't want the real image height, but the resized height
[09:33:13] <winux> shoky: wonder if that is expected behaviour
[09:34:03] <shoky> winux: it's expected that the form will submit when validation is over and valid
[09:34:56] <winux> shoky: but that it overrides a preventDefault/return false on the forms submit handler
[09:36:23] <shoky> winux: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/5RrGa/179/
[09:40:31] <codepython777> http://jsfiddle.net/kPSBS/2/ -- How can I make this example so that when someone clicks a trash icon, the element is deleted?

[09:42:55] <shoky> codepython777: http://jsfiddle.net/kPSBS/3/
[09:44:09] <shoky> winux: implicit how
[09:44:38] <codepython777> shoky: thanks.
[09:44:58] <winux> shoky: i dont call validate() anywhere
[09:45:04] <winux> shoky: but my fields have required classes
[09:45:30] <shoky> winux: and the validation is working?
[09:45:34] <winux> shoky: yeah
[09:45:47] <winux> shoky: unless some other script calls it
[09:45:51] <shoky> didn't know it can be used like that...
[09:45:59] <winux> shoky: and i just am oblivious
[09:46:20] <winux> shoky: but i stepped through it and didnt see an explicit call
[09:47:06] <shoky> why aren't you calling .validate() ?
[09:47:40] <shoky> (also, notice that my fiddle stops validating if you remove the .validate() call..)
[09:47:58] <kaylee> howdy
[09:48:28] <winux> shoky: hmm
[09:48:33] <codepython777> shoky: $(this).closest('li').remove(); -- how can i pull this li's id tag in a variable?
[09:48:33] <winux> shoky: ill take another look
[09:48:52] <shoky> codepython777: .attr('id')
[09:49:03] <codepython777> something like li_id = $(this).closest('li').attr('id') ?
[09:49:14] <shoky> ya
[09:49:28] <codepython777> thanks
[09:50:02] <winux> shoky: it looks like there is another vaguely named script written by someone else that does call it. sorry

[09:56:42] <zeromix> I think I have a basic misunderstanding of how $.when can function... I'm trying to keep adding things to a $.when call (continue queueing deferreds), but i can't seem to find a way to do this... only adding them at the initial $.when call.  is there a way to append deferreds to a $.when call?
[09:57:52] <g0z> hm nevermind
[09:58:01] <ajpiano> zeromix: you can't just append more deffereds to a $.when
[09:58:19] <ajpiano> what are you trying to do
[09:58:57] <Vainoharhainen> No one knows? I got two $(window).on('scroll', function()Â {..}); how can i kill one of them?
[09:59:34] <ajpiano> Vainoharhainen: what do you mean by "kill"
[09:59:41] <ENQ> unset probably
[09:59:44] <Vainoharhainen> ajpiano: jQuery(window).off(..
[09:59:51] <ENQ> do it so, off
[09:59:57] <ENQ> :D
[10:00:02] <textchimp> i need an image processing library that works on canvases, not just img objects (like Pixastic). can anyone recommend one or can i convert from canvas to img on the fly?
[10:00:12] <Vainoharhainen> ajpiano: U not reading? I got two .on
[10:00:26] <winux> Vainoharhainen: remove the second line of code.. wtf?
[10:00:41] <ajpiano> Vainoharhainen: you can unbind with a function reference or use a namespaced event handler
[10:01:08] <ENQ> Vainoharhainen, use .off() :)
[10:01:13] <ajpiano> Vainoharhainen: .on("scroll.infinite", fn) on("scroll.otherthing", fn) .off("scroll.otherthing")
[10:01:16] <Vainoharhainen> ENQ...
[10:01:35] <ENQ> Vainoharhainen, http://api.jquery.com/off/
[10:01:52] <Vainoharhainen> ENQ: ....
[10:01:56] <Vainoharhainen> ajpiano: thanks!
[10:01:59] <ENQ> Vainoharhainen, ....
[10:02:54] <Vainoharhainen> ENQ, i know that off exists i asked how i can SPECIFY which "on" i want to "kill".
[10:03:03] <ENQ> oh
[10:03:04] <ajpiano> Vainoharhainen: you can also use a func ref
[10:03:33] <ajpiano> so if you have function foo() { }  $(".bar").on("wat", foo);  then you can later unbind with $(".bar").off("wat", foo)
[10:03:56] <Vainoharhainen> ajpiano: Thanks for the help :) i will test out both :)
[10:10:02] <keirlav87> has anyone experienced a situation using jquery ui autocomplete where you just get a long list of 'undefined' in teh results, even though I can see in firebug that the result returns 1 item, and is as expected?
[10:11:10] <joikus> what's a nice way to sort an already rendered <select> on document ready ?
[10:11:17] <joikus> I need to sort it alphabetically

[10:17:28] <zeromix> ajpiano: Basically, trying to queue up a series of requests that rely on a previous request, but can only be instantiated once the parent request has been resolved (due to needing data from the response)
[10:17:29] <wroathe> I've got an event bound to click that I'd like to unbind and then pass the listener for that event as a callback to a new listener I create, what's the best way to do that?
[10:17:42] <ajpiano> zeromix: you need to use pipe
[10:17:51] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[10:18:04] <ajpiano> damn
[10:18:15] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[10:19:51] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/8XgNB/1/ would it be a good idea to join the two functions into one, like in the commented code?
[10:22:46] <zeromix> ajpiano: I'm making multiple parallel requests, won't pipe only help with linear requests?
[10:23:20] <ajpiano> zeromix: if one is dependent on the other, they'd need to be linear, eh
[10:23:54] <ajpiano> zeromix: if you have complex async flow control requirements you might want to check out a lib like async https://github.com/caolan/async/
[10:23:55] <zeromix> req1->subreq1,subreq2;req2->subreqA->subsubreqI
[10:24:26] <zeromix> subreq1 and 2 depend on req1, while req2 chains to subreqA which chains to subsubreqI
[10:25:15] <ajpiano> zeromix: you can ostensibly get that to work, but i can't think about it too hard right now as i'm on the phone
[10:25:22] <zeromix> understood.
[10:25:42] <zeromix> Right now we have it working in Chrome, but the XHR band is smaller on FF and IE
[10:25:49] <zeromix> so we get concurrency issues in those browsers.
[10:26:43] <joikus> I used this to sort, it works: http://pastebin.com/6EWELT68  but the french characters are at the bottom

[10:27:23] <_geekbuntu> hi - is this the best way to find the last row id from dynamically produced row-ids? http://jsfiddle.net/xy8Nw/1/  tia,
[10:27:50] <MattDunbar> .
[10:30:31] <wroathe> Is there a way to unbind an event handler from an event and save it in a variable to reattach later?
[10:30:46] <wroathe> var oldHandler = $(element).unbind('click');
[10:31:00] <wroathe> and then later $(element).click(oldHandler);
[10:33:28] <wroathe> Anyone?
[10:35:07] <Jon471> wroathe: I believe the event handler functions are stored in a jquery internal data array that you can access (element.data('events') maybe?) but it would probably be a lot easier to describe the specific problem you're having, i suspect there's an easier solution
[10:40:16] <wroathe> Jon471: I've set up an accordion on my client's site and when it starts to change I've got a handler set up to pull in content for the next panel via ajax. Problem is, there's no way for the panel to know how tall it needs to be to contain the content that will be there and so the animation is jagged. It performs an animation to slide the panel down about 10px and then it snaps into it's full height as the content loads.
[10:40:55] <wroathe> As a solution I thought it would be simple enough to get a reference to the handler that performs that animation and pass that in to my function that performs the ajax work and then call that reference as a callback after the work has been finished.
[10:41:05] <wroathe> Delaying it long enough for content to fill the space.
[10:41:14] <FernandoBasso> Somehow, this seems to be assigning an empty value to #txt element in the document. I run it on every keyup event. This is the line: var myText = $('#txt').val();
[10:41:42] <chilversc> wroathe: what if you put a loading placeholder in there, and animate to that height, then when the content is available, swap in the content and animate to the full height?
[10:42:05] <wroathe> chilversc: The client doesn't want to do that. I offered that as a solution
[10:42:26] <wroathe> He wants a loading indicator to appear in the header after the user clicks and when the content has loaded have it perform that animation
[10:42:34] <chilversc> wroathe: ah, so you want to load the content, swap the content in there, then animate the slide
[10:42:42] <wroathe> Yeah
[10:42:59] <wroathe> So that the animation occurs once and is smooth.
[10:45:30] <wroathe> Unless anyhone has any suggestions I think the easy way to do that would be to find a way to get that handlers reference and then use it as a callback.
[10:48:17] <chilversc> wroathe: it seems the accordian isn't really designed for ajax loading of its content like that
[10:49:25] <chilversc> wroathe: can you not load all the content in one shot at the start so you don't need to fetch it via ajax?
[10:49:38] <wroathe> There are a lot of images on each panel.
[10:49:50] <wroathe> So no. I don't want to do that.
[10:50:06] <wroathe> And I dont know what you mean by "designed" to do that
[10:51:09] <chilversc> wroathe: well looking at all the examples on jQuery UI for the accordian, it seems there simply are no hooks for this at convenient points
[10:52:20] <wroathe> changestart
[10:52:24] <wroathe> takes a callback
[10:53:00] <chilversc> right, but nothing to say, hang on a moment, don't animate/display just yet
[10:53:20] <wroathe> Well sometimes you've got to write code to get what you want :)
[10:54:22] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/8XgNB/1/ - I made this text input appear once the first radio button is clicked, and disappear once the second radio button is clicked.
[10:54:25] <abletony84> Is there a way to make the text input disappear as long as the first radio button is deselected though? That way if the second radio button is clicked, it won't try to hide the text input if there's no text input to hide.
[10:54:26] <chilversc> yeah, just looking at how it operates, and examples by other people, it just seems to me like the main design is for it to be a small widget that doesn't have huge amounts of content
[10:54:56] <shoky> wroathe: use the 'event' option
[10:55:02] <shoky> with your own custom event
[10:55:06] <wroathe> Yeah, I'm reading about that.
[10:55:07] <wroathe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6631570/once-an-event-is-bound-in-jquery-how-do-you-get-a-reference-to-the-event-handler
[10:55:10] <wroathe> Also, this.
[10:55:17] <wroathe> Semes like a good solution.
[10:56:20] <wroathe> Despite the fact that hijacking events is bad programming design in general I'm surprised they haven't implemented a function like that.
[10:56:34] <shoky> why not the event option..
[10:56:46] <shoky> it's exactly what you're looking for
[10:56:56] <wroathe> Can you give me a quick example?
[10:56:56] <chilversc> wroathe: right, which was my comment on the design, and why it seems like it isn't designed for this
[10:57:12] <wroathe> $.Event?
[10:57:15] <wroathe> shoky?
[10:57:19] <jkl_> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/344h7/
[10:57:44] <jkl_> What I did is: 1. add the same name to the radio buttons (you see they were both selected at the same time, which is innatural)
[10:57:52] <wroathe> chilversc: Yeah. I know. But I need to do something.
[10:57:53] <shoky> wroathe: the 'event' option of the jquery ui accordion
[10:58:01] <jkl_> 2. then remove preventDefault() as it was no longer needed
[10:58:20] <shoky> wroathe: http://jsfiddle.net/RGfxv/2/
[10:58:52] <chilversc> wroathe: well one question is, is there an alternative widget out there that does what you need rather than the jQuery one?
[10:59:09] <tw2113> slightly off topic, what tools/apps do you mac users use for your jQuery work? besides text editor and browser. I have those two covered
[10:59:11] <shoky> no need for an alternative :\
[10:59:34] <wroathe> shoky you're an awesome human being
[10:59:35] <abletony84> jkl_: nice not bad
[10:59:38] <wroathe> THank you so much
[10:59:39] <jedizombie> why does that accordion have a 1 sec delay on the interaction?
[10:59:54] <wroathe> jedizombie: because that's what I'm trying to achieve.
[10:59:55] <shoky> because i put a setTimeout on it
[10:59:55] <jkl_> tw2113: the jquery documentation
[11:00:03] <jedizombie> ... why
[11:00:05] <jkl_> nothing else is required.
[11:00:06] <jedizombie> thats horrible
[11:00:08] <jedizombie> HORRIBLE
[11:00:13] <shoky> to simulate an async ajax call, you doofus
[11:00:31] <jedizombie> i'll simulate you
[11:00:33] <jedizombie> *wink*
[11:00:34] <abletony84> jkl_: just concerned about the last-child on click, about it running page.hide() if there's no #page to hide kinda
[11:00:41] <jedizombie> oh wait, that's stimulate
[11:00:41] <shoky> schwing
[11:00:43] <tw2113> jkl_ just in general, no local app or anything?
[11:00:48] <wroathe> shoky: <3
[11:00:54] <shoky> ;]
[11:01:47] <abletony84> yo quantegy
[11:01:55] <jkl_> what for? do you have any specific needs that are not covered by the tools you have?
[11:02:26] <abletony84> jkl_: dunno im just not used to firing off unnecessary loads
[11:02:59] <abletony84> except u know
[11:03:02] <jkl_> "what for..." was a reply to tw2113
[11:03:03] <abletony84> when im wif the ladies ;)
[11:03:06] <jkl_> >>
[11:03:09] <abletony84> oh
[11:03:11] <tw2113> i'm researching for suggestions for a future mac i hope to have
[11:03:21] <Baraneedharan__> hi any one can help me fixing the issue with localscroll plugin?
[11:03:48] <tw2113> that's all :D
[11:06:13] <jkl__> abletony84: you can see a <div id="page"> in the html, that's what the variable page refers... no webpage loading
[11:06:22] <jkl__> don't worry
[11:08:19] <maslo> hi guys if anyone could help me out with an .animate it would be very appreciated, I'm trying to animate the menu after/done hovering services on this website http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/, the js for the dropdown is here http://projects.upbeatdev.com/aem/wp-content/themes/aem/js/function.js, thanks
[11:14:49] <sarspazam> when i'm filtering a list, is there an easy way to show everything but what I've just filtered?
[11:15:42] <silverwind> Do the opposite of that filter?
[11:16:10] <sarspazam> can you chain filters .filter().filter()?
[11:16:20] <jkl__> agree with silverwind: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[11:16:45] <jkl__> .filter(   ":not(whatever)"   )
[11:17:32] <sarspazam> ah okay cheers
[11:17:45] <shoky> .not()
[11:18:27] <sarspazam> i tried a not() after the filter the same as the filter but it didn't work
[11:19:07] <shoky> sarspazam chaining filters will keep filtering
[11:19:20] <shoky> sarspazam so obviously chaining a filter with its inverse will get you nothing
[11:19:24] <sarspazam> yeah that's cool, i wondered if it'd reset the orginal
[11:19:35] <shoky> sarspazam: you can use .end() to 'reset' it
[11:19:45] <shoky> and then chain more shit
[11:19:49] <sarspazam> i guess you need to do it agian with the same selector using not
[11:19:52] <sarspazam> one with show one with hide
[11:20:18] <shoky> .not() also takes elements as argument
[11:20:33] <sarspazam> is it exactly the same just opposite from filter?
[11:21:48] <shoky> ignore my last comment
[11:22:33] <lathan_away> not(arg) = filter(':not(' + arg + ')')
[11:23:13] <sarspazam> http://jsbin.com/afukab/watch
[11:24:17] <lathan> sarspazam, that jsbin link doesn't exist....
[11:24:26] <sarspazam> ill try again
[11:24:36] <sarspazam> just try http://jsbin.com/afukab/
[11:25:00] <lathan> blank page with JS Bin
[11:25:02] <shoky> you try it
[11:25:15] <lathan> sarspazam, its been a while since I jsbinned....does it need a save or a publish?
[11:25:22] <lathan> it will run without saving /updating
[11:25:28] <sarspazam> well, i didn't think so
[11:26:05] <sarspazam> http://3.jsbin.com/afukab/1/edit
[11:26:09] <lathan> well it won't be the right url until its like afukab/4/
[11:26:10] <sarspazam> that should?
[11:26:53] <lathan> still a blank/white page with the page title of JS Bin
[11:27:26] <sarspazam> yeah that's shit
[11:27:31] <sarspazam> guess it's not ready yet
[11:28:27] <lathan> I suggest jsfiddle.net
[11:28:41] <lathan> but I know jsbin (at least it did) has verry similar functionality
[11:28:42] <sarspazam> yeah I usually use fiddle but thought id give it a try
[11:28:59] <sarspazam> cause it's all done in js
[11:29:05] <sarspazam> and live preview (Y)
[11:29:45] <lathan> you don't always want live preview
[11:29:54] <lathan> jsfiddle will preview with ctrl+enter
[11:30:32] <sarspazam> so stupid default library in fiddle is mootools, who uses that :p
[11:31:10] <lathan> I know...
[11:31:17] <sarspazam> http://jsfiddle.net/sTBbV/
[11:31:18] <lathan> I should look for a setting in the account profile there to change that
[11:31:37] <sarspazam> thats what i was doing anyway
[11:31:50] <lathan> hm...no account settings
[11:31:52] <Carlitta87> hi, i have a simple question.... I would like to make a document always print in color... every time i try to print a document....it comes up in black n white.....but I've tried on other websites such as google and there appears to be color.....how can i change this?
[11:32:00] <sarspazam> need to find work out a way to filter things based on multiple classes
[11:32:11] <sarspazam> didn't have any success with using mutliple selectors earlier
[11:33:05] <lathan> .filter('.class1.class2')
[11:33:26] <Gaurav__> hey all i have a simple question ....how to i move the button down smotthely when i hover on it....
[11:33:41] <sarspazam> :@
[11:33:54] <sarspazam> i really hope I didn't fuck an hour and a half earlier when its that easy
[11:34:05] <lathan> possibly
[11:34:06] <lathan> bye
[11:37:29] <my200> Backbone.js has a nice event binding feature where you can do thing.on(function(){  this.blah()  },this), and the context is passed to the event handler. In jquery, do people just pass in this as eventData or what?
[11:39:14] <jkl__> gaurav__: a way is to set transition-duration via css ( http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#transition-duration-property ) then change the coords via css
[11:40:57] <jkl__> my200: not sure I understood you correctly, but here is the list of event binding methods: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[11:41:05] <jkl__> there you can see the parameters of each one
[11:41:12] <jkl__> that is of your interest
[11:48:02] <Gaurav__> jkl__: thanks man
[11:48:32] <jkl__> glad to help :)
[11:50:52] <jkl__> my200: also, in the event handler function you can write $(this) to mean the element that the event occurred on.
[11:57:08] <Gaurav__> jkl__: hey transition-duration doesn't work in ie
[11:58:43] <dethkrieg> my first time seeing jsfiddle, awesome, yes I'm late to the party, but it's still sweeet
[11:59:57] <jkl__> gaurav__: oh man, my fault - forgot it's CSS3 and did not check browser support. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(Cascading_Style_Sheets)#cite_ref-104
[12:00:22] <jkl__> ... sorry
[12:02:08] <jkl__> If I read it correctly, it works on Mozilla with -moz-* and on Chrome with -webkit-*
[12:03:55] <jkl__> gaurav__: another idea that comes to my mind is a plain old setTimeout(f, 100) where f moves the button a bit towards the endpoint
[12:05:11] <jkl__> gaurav__: an alternative is .animate() http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:09:15] <sunbeam> Any uniform js users in here?
[12:13:37] <sunbeam> $('#id form').submit(function(e,data){ // do something.. });
[12:13:45] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this? somehow it doesn't trigger
[12:13:50] <sunbeam> when this form is submitted
[12:16:12] <monk13> so i got a user complaint about my website (jquery plugin not functioning as it should). I asked what browser they were on. and she replied back AOL 9.5 hehe.
[12:16:21] <monk13> does AOL have its own browser or does it embed IE?
[12:16:44] <xmaddness> ...
[12:16:54] <monk13> I coulda swore it embeds IE but i do see '[AOL 9.5 has ]A Better Browser' on the AOL download page lol.
[12:17:03] <chovy> sunbeam: what is data
[12:17:14] <chovy> also, is the element already in the dom when you attach it?
[12:18:15] <MistuhKurtz> is it best to bind keydown events to the window object? document?
[12:19:32] <monk13> What a backwards question to be asking. sorry for even mentioning AOL on irc lol ;)
[12:19:48] <xmaddness> I am hearing aol uses netscape 5 or 6
[12:19:52] <xmaddness> from a co worker
[12:19:59] <xmaddness> not sure how true that is though
[12:20:34] <sunbeam> chovy: yes it is in the dom, data is 1 as input param
[12:20:41] <sunbeam> chovy: eh actually not when submitted
[12:21:45] <jkl__> sunbeam: could you please post a fiddle? we cannot answer you without knowing the html
[12:22:09] <HassanS> can I use jQuery on the HTML loaded in an iframe?
[12:22:29] <jkl__> monk13: yes, AOL incapsulates Trident, which is Internet Explorer's layout engine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)
[12:23:11] <jkl__> IE is just a program built around Trident.
[12:23:20] <monk13> jkl__,  cool thanks for the info. Our website targets seniors so im not surprised they using AOL.
[12:23:44] <jkl__> So the browser is different, the HTML/CSS engine is the same.
[12:23:48] <jkl__> yw.
[12:24:32] <daum> can you watch a container and if the overflow causes a scroll bar add width to that container?  My problem is when the scroll barappears it decreases the width and causes the design to break
[12:24:47] <sunbeam> jkl__: ok
[12:25:29] <sunbeam> i'll put it in other words
[12:25:38] <sunbeam> I want to prevent the user from being able to submit a form by pressing enter
[12:25:42] <sunbeam> Anyone know how I can best doi that?
[12:25:47] <jkl__> No, please post the html code that the Javascript is working upon.
[12:26:13] <HassanS> daum could you select the height of the frame and then dynamically increase the width if it's larger than some number?
[12:26:17] <chovy> sunbeam: e.preventDefault()
[12:26:35] <sunbeam> chovy: yes, but that will also prevent click?
[12:26:43] <chovy> click?
[12:26:49] <sunbeam> yes?
[12:26:55] <chovy> it'll prevent submit regardless of how the form was submitted.
[12:27:29] <sunbeam> yes, and thats not what i want
[12:27:32] <chovy> sunbeam: paste a jsfiddle.net
[12:27:37] <sunbeam> i want to be able to have the form submit by clcik
[12:27:38] <sunbeam> click
[12:27:41] <sunbeam> simple as that
[12:27:42] <jkl__> ^
[12:27:42] <jkl__> |
[12:27:45] <daum> HassanS, maybe will have to see
[12:27:47] <chovy> why would you differentiate?
[12:27:55] <sunbeam> because this form consists of many slides
[12:27:56] <chovy> a submit is a sbumit
[12:28:07] <sunbeam> and users tend to press enter to submit a form while not all slides have passed
[12:28:41] <chovy> maybe use button then that does $(this).submit()
[12:30:25] <sunbeam> but then , when users focus on a text input field, they can press enter anyway?
[12:30:31] <sunbeam> or? i dont get it
[12:32:27] <shoky> sunbeam: can you put the submit button outside the form?
[12:32:32] <LindsayMac> Quick question... if I am doing .animate({ height: <~~ can I put a function to calculate height in there?
[12:33:03] <sunbeam> button will also submit when enter is pressed
[12:33:14] <shoky> ah actually no need
[12:33:15] <sunbeam> shoky: nop
[12:33:53] <shoky> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/ES2Mc/
[12:34:08] <LindsayMac> i think im finally starting to get a hang of this JS stuff
[12:34:17] <LindsayMac> wow,, never thought I would say that
[12:35:04] <shoky> LindsayMac: you can put a function _call_ there (evaluated to its return value)
[12:35:27] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ok.. I need to learn how to do that now.. google to the rescue
[12:35:27] <sunbeam> shoky: thanks!
[12:35:41] <LindsayMac> shoky:  what about something like this; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5182511/jquery-animating-width-height-but-stay-centered
[12:35:42] <shoky> LindsayMac:  .animate({ height:  someFunction() })
[12:36:07] <shoky> LindsayMac: what about it? there's no function passed there
[12:36:36] <LindsayMac> I was thinking I could pass the output of the function in a variable and use that... to simplify..
[12:36:36] <shoky> there are function calls there, sure, thats fine as i said
[12:36:39] <LindsayMac> if thats even possible
[12:36:43] <shoky> of course it is
[12:37:07] <LindsayMac> shoky:  doing it that way would probably be best so I can use it in my initializations multiple times
[12:37:19] <sunbeam> shoky: its a simple form, but it also submits
[12:37:21] <sunbeam> even with that
[12:38:10] <shoky> sunbeam: well you're doing something different then..
[12:38:30] <shoky> or if you're talking about my fiddle.. i only tested on chrome ;P
[12:43:10] <initself> i'm already missing all the basics?
[12:43:11] <initself> <span id="user_id">MWB</span>
[12:43:18] <initself> console.log($('span#user_id').val());
[12:43:21] <initself> empty
[12:43:37] <initself> isn't that how you get value from an id?
[12:43:51] <shoky> initself: .val() gets the 'value' attribute
[12:43:59] <initself> which is MWB, right?
[12:44:03] <initself> oh
[12:44:04] <shoky> no
[12:44:06] <initself> right
[12:44:09] <shoky> you probably want .text()
[12:44:10] <initself> i need .text
[12:44:12] <initself> shoky__
[12:44:16] <initself> shoky++
[12:44:22] <shoky> ;]
[12:46:55] <LindsayMac> Bahhh i just wrote my own variable to calculate height of the window and stuck it in an animate... all on my own!
[12:47:36] <LindsayMac> gr but now something else strange is happening with my smooth scrolling!! AHHH I DISLIKE JS
[12:47:41] <zamba> i need an event to fire for each character i type in an input field
[12:47:52] <zamba> .change() only triggered when the input field lost focus
[12:48:06] <shoky> zamba: .keyup()
[12:48:38] <zamba> ah, thanks
[12:48:48] <shoky> or .on('change keyup', ...)
[12:52:41] <monk13> I been using 'input' event for almost any 'change' in an input field (handles typing, and copy and paste better than checking for keyCodes and such).
[12:52:57] <abletony84> Gentlemen
[12:52:59] <abletony84> Ladies
[12:53:04] <monk13> not sure your situation zamba, but maybe could be useful. it doesn't work well in old versions of IE though.
[12:53:05] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Zv7bF/1/ - how do I make Option B appear only when Option A is checked?
[12:54:52] <shoky> heh
[12:56:52] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/Zv7bF/2/
[12:57:40] <abletony84> cool
[12:57:51] <abletony84> didnt know one could do that - thanks a lot man..
[12:58:01] <shoky> yw
[12:58:32] <shoky> you were doing .on(attr('checked',true), ...
[12:59:07] <shoky> there's no attr function , and the first argument to on needs to be the event type(s)
[13:01:03] <abletony84> ah yeah..
[13:04:19] <abletony84> shoky: can i apply the same technique to radios? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/8XgNB/1/ => http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/8XgNB/2/ somehow?
[13:06:56] <abletony84> Instead of showing the input field when the first radio button is clicked, and hiding it when the second radio button is clicked, I was hoping I could show the input field only when the first radio button is clicked. (for simplicity's sake - but also so that it doesn't attempt to hide an input field that ain't there incase the second radio button gets clicked before the first)
[13:08:42] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/8XgNB/6/
[13:09:11] <shoky> i added a name to the radios so only one can be selected at a time
[13:10:15] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm still not able in preventing the default behavior of "enter" when a form is submitted, does anyone know how I can completely prevent the form being submitted?
[13:12:21] <Crumbz> sunbeam, event.preventDefault()
[13:12:54] <shoky> sunbeam: the fiddle i gave you works on chrome and FF and IE
[13:12:57] <LindsayMac> i think thats the 10th time someone told you preventDefault sunbeam
[13:13:05] <abletony84> shoky: awesome man
[13:13:37] <shoky> sunbeam: so obviously you are doing something differently than the fiddle. find what it is.
[13:13:42] <Crumbz> sunbeam, $(selector).on('click', function(event) {event.preventDefault(); //code here;});
[13:13:50] <abletony84> believe me once my startup starts making my millions im gonna throw a HUGE ass party for all you guys
[13:13:54] <shoky> not click
[13:14:04] <Crumbz> sorry onsubmit
[13:14:14] <abletony84> you, pachet, Eviltwin, shoot even coldhead
[13:14:21] <Crumbz> sumit*
[13:14:23] <shoky> even coldhead???
[13:14:45] <sunbeam> shoky: Crumbz ok
[13:15:07] <Peter_lee> Anyone ever use Jquery Token Input with Rails plugin acts_as_taggable_on?
[13:15:10] <abletony84> hehe
[13:15:24] <abletony84> yup
[13:15:33] <shoky> sunbeam: notice that in my fiddle, there is <input type="button" value="submit">   and nowhere is there a <button> and nowhere is there a <input type="submit">
[13:15:34] <abletony84> somewhere down here http://www.fourseasons.com/borabora/
[13:15:36] <Peter_lee> I've created tags but trying to create tag clouds for each, having a really hard time
[13:15:53] <shoky> sunbeam: all 3 of those are important not to deviate from
[13:16:54] <abletony84> shoky: thanks again man
[13:17:01] <abletony84> until then.. hold tight!!
[13:17:12] <shoky> E_HOLDING_ALL_HORSES

[13:23:53] <omnipotent1> any ideas why I might be getting Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function here: http://pastebin.com/v5Cw57kc
[13:23:56] <omnipotent1> line 11
[13:25:09] <shoky> omnipotent1 the last line should be:  })(window);
[13:25:18] <omnipotent1> I thought it could be either way
[13:25:56] <omnipotent1> so, the weird thing is, it works if I call all the scripts separately, but if I combine them into one, it breaks with that error
[13:27:35] <shoky> i'm not getting the error
[13:32:52] <omnipotent1> shoky: I got it fixed, fyi
[13:37:34] <shoky> omnipotent1: what was the problem?
[13:46:13] <omnipotent1> shoky: so, my js was merged, and a different script forgot a semicolon
[13:47:37] <NoiseEee> how are you 'merging' ?

[13:50:39] <jkl__> You want the function to read some property of the elment the event belongs to, right?
[13:50:54] <rosieres_respawn> yes
[13:51:11] <jkl__> Does $(this) *inside the function* work?
[13:51:24] <daevski> Hey everyone. I'm some content generated by webpoint (ppt to html) converter and it uses ajax to load the slides on the page. I'm wondering if there is a way for jquery to detect when the last query finishes or maybe detect if any are running.
[13:51:38] <daevski> I can see in firebug that there is one query for each 2x slides.
[13:52:31] <rosieres_respawn> jkl_ : yes http://jsfiddle.net/8TJyD/2/
[13:52:50] <jkl__> great, so does that solve your problem?
[13:53:40] <rosieres_respawn> jkl__: but I wanted to learn how I pass the property
[13:57:34] <daevski> It also might not truely be ajax, since it's via an iframe. Maybe it's just using ajax to load the slides in the iframe?
[13:58:31] <jkl__> rosieres_respawn: as far as I know, you cannot pass it as a function parameter. hover() does not accept any arguments except the event handlers
[13:58:34] <jkl__> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:59:34] <jkl__> An alternative is by a global variable, but I'd definitely advise the $(this) thing, because it's shorter and cleaner
[13:59:57] <daevski> I can use $(frames[0].window.document).contents() to access things inside there, but not sure if that would even be useful.
[14:00:58] <rosieres_respawn> jkl__:ok thank you !
[14:04:07] <jkl__> daevski: jquery has no notion of webpoint, nor of a slide, etc, so I think you'd be more fortunate in hacking the webpoint-generated js
[14:04:34] <daevski> jkl__:  yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to hook into it.
[14:11:09] <pjungwir> Hello, I wanted to propose a new option for jQuery-UI's datepicker, and contribute a patch if it sounds good to people.
[14:11:18] <pjungwir> Is this the right place?
[14:12:04] <ajpiano> pjungwir: no, the right place is the jquery ui bug tracker
[14:12:09] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[14:12:16] <pjungwir> Okay, thanks!
[14:22:21] <riku> does anyone know if it's possible to input other values to jquery autocomplete ajax query in addition to the "term" query
[14:22:44] <morris_hunt> hello. I have an image to which I am trying to retrieve the value of it's alt attribute via $('img').attr('alt') and concatenate it to a string "hi" for instance. When I use $('img').attr('alt') alone I see the value just fine but when I try to concatenate I always receive a undefined type and the string "hi"
[14:22:57] <morris_hunt> is there any particular way to concatenate values recieved from the attr function?
[14:24:04] <NoiseEee> morris_hunt: crystal ball... fuzzy.
[14:24:15] <NoiseEee> morris_hunt: try showing us your actual code
[14:24:24] <troll-boy> Is it possible to automatically assign serialized data to a form? Like $('#myform').loadForm(serializedData);
[14:24:54] <morris_hunt> NoiseEee: right sorry about that
[14:27:16] <Frantic> does anyone know of any framework that does content generation, like a javascript framework for CMS builders?
[14:29:13] <troll-boy> Frantic, define "generate content" or rather "content generation"
[14:29:39] <Frantic> troll-boy: something that would aid me in developing a CMS backend
[14:30:11] <Frantic> to be honest I'm not sure what I'm looking for, but I'm asking around because I get the feeling that if I don't, I'll end up finding something and hating myself for it :)
[14:30:15] <troll-boy> Frantic, that's still AWFULLY vague
[14:30:23] <troll-boy> jquery does MAGIC with forms and logic though
[14:30:26] <troll-boy> so you should be good
[14:30:32] <troll-boy> what sorta cms are you building?
[14:31:11] <Frantic> troll-boy: I'm building a CMS-like backend where a user can generate his own page. Drop widgets into content areas. The widgets can be moved, resized, have option popups, etc.
[14:31:23] <itatitat> guys, I remember something about hover event and mouseover.....mouseover is recommend no¿
[14:31:27] <Frantic> I know a lot of people do this nowadays, that's why I'm asking if there's anything out there that can help me with it
[14:31:41] <troll-boy> itatitat, .hover() I believe is what you want
[14:31:53] <troll-boy> sounds like jquery is what you want Frantic
[14:32:01] <itatitat> ah ok, yes, I was thinking of them both, thanks
[14:32:01] <troll-boy> I'd love to see your stuff when you're done
[14:32:49] <Frantic> troll-boy: TBH, jQuery is not what I want, I want to use something like Backbone or Emberjs, since I really do want MVC or else I'll go crazy with just jQuery
[14:33:19] <troll-boy> then... why ask?
[14:35:32] <Frantic> troll-boy: sorry, I don't mean to troll (lol, troll-boy), just asking if anyone has heard of any framework on top of jQuery which would help with this, something like Backbone but more specialized towards a CMS admin page
[14:37:07] <Meowth> Hey guysm I'm having issues trying to sort based off lastname. http://jsfiddle.net/una8S/3/  sorting by first name is easy, how can I modify that to implement the last name instead of first?
[14:37:42] <silverwind> Frantic, if you want a complete solution with a toolkit.. take a loot at extjs.
[14:38:10] <silverwind> Frantic, if you want a MV* framework to help handling complexity then.. backbone/ember are good choices
[14:38:16] <Frantic> Meowth: instead of generating upA and upB, generate lastA and lastB, by splitting a.text() andj b.text()
[14:38:56] <Frantic> silverwind: ext is hard to skin, I'm thinking of going with ember/backbone/spine, but was wondering if there's anything more specialized for CMSes since a LOT of people do this nowadays
[14:39:03] <Meowth> Frantic, I tried but that didn't work
[14:39:36] <silverwind> Frantic, not sure what a CMS would require that is different than any other website :/
[14:40:46] <Frantic> silverwind: I'm thinking of a BlockOrderedContainerController, MovableBlockView, BlockOptionsView, etc
[14:41:01] <Frantic> like I said, not sure what exactly I'm looking for :)
[14:41:19] <ajpiano> Frantic: i don't think there exists a client side mvc framework specifically for the creation of interfaces for cmses
[14:41:27] <ajpiano> what you are looking for is a unicorn
[14:42:37] <Frantic> ok, thanks for trying guys, I appreciate it
[14:43:08] <ajpiano> riku: there is
[14:43:15] <riku> :o
[14:43:16] <Meowth> Frantic, do you see the reason why it doesn't work?
[14:43:19] <ajpiano> you just use a custom source: function() {}  and do your own ajax request
[14:43:39] <lcb> Hi. could you plsease give me a suggestion of a good and customizable HTML5â€²s audio/video web  broadcasting  jquery player so I could try to adapt to it an interface I designed?...
[14:43:42] <riku> alright, ill read about that one then. thank you ajpiano !
[14:44:26] <ajpiano> riku: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[14:44:45] <ajpiano> you get the request information and a continuation to call when the xhr is complete
[14:44:58] <ajpiano> that's the general idea you need to follow
[14:45:30] <riku> okay, sound pretty simple
[14:49:25] <itatitat> guys I've this weird error with hover.... http://snipt.org/vsjc3#expand
[14:50:01] <itatitat> seems like only detect the event for out.....
[14:50:08] <Frantic> Meowth: http://jsfiddle.net/QNdAW/1/
[14:50:39] <jkl__> Meowth, first name ordering works by chance. Your html has no notion of a first or last name.
[14:51:09] <Meowth> Frantic, thanks
[14:51:25] <Frantic> Meowth: just try to understand why it works, use console.log
[14:53:20] <itatitat> someone know why this happen? http://snipt.org/vsjc3#expand
[14:53:44] <jkl__> Those hacks won't work in a alanguage that puts last name before first name, e.g. chinese. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080526192039AAk49jU
[14:54:16] <jkl__> Sir <span class="firstname">Adam</span> <span class="lastname">Smith</span>
[14:54:35] <jkl__> This way you can control.
[14:55:48] <jkl__> itatitat: put the ( on the same line as jQuery('.house').live
[14:55:56] <itatitat> ouch!
[14:56:53] <jkl__> JS allows for a field get to be a stand-alone statement (which honestly, is pointless)
[14:57:12] <itatitat> jkl__: no...............the same...
[14:58:49] <jkl__> hrm, so will need to debug http://jsfiddle.net/p59zw/
[15:01:06] <alexidoia> hi
[15:01:25] <alexidoia> I am inside a td and looking to select the closet tr, how can I do this ?
[15:01:37] <alexidoia> actually its parent
[15:02:01] <zoned> is there a way i can make animate() halt execution of other code until its done, aside from using a complete callback?
[15:02:29] <zoned> or just using complete to start again
[15:02:30] <jkl__> itatitat: I only see handlerin evnts
[15:02:59] <jkl__> alexidoia http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[15:02:59] <itatitat> really?!?!?!?, I'll try with another browser.........very weird!!
[15:03:06] <itatitat> thanks for testing my code
[15:03:16] <jkl__> yeah
[15:03:28] <alexidoia> jkl__: yes I got this, but I need to know the element I am in
[15:03:52] <jkl__> i don't get... you mean $(this) ?
[15:04:06] <alexidoia> jkl__: I might
[15:04:29] <jkl__> $(this).parent()
[15:05:37] <alexidoia> how do I get the name of the parent element, because this returns an object
[15:05:57] <alexidoia> I need to check on its kind (tr, div ...)
[15:06:13] <DukeDave> Is there a jQuery equivalent to Ruby on Rails' 'try' method?
[15:06:27] <DukeDave> So, if var is defined call method upon it, else undefined
[15:06:47] <zoned> try { // something } catch (e) { console.log(e); }
[15:06:54] <jkl__> alexidoia $(this).parent().is("tr")     http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:07:02] <alexidoia> jkl__: thanks a lot
[15:07:31] <lcb> Hi. could you plsease give me a suggestion of a good and customizable HTML5â€²s audio/video web  broadcasting  jquery player so I could try to adapt to it an interface I designed?...
[15:07:44] <zoned> DukeDave, in your example.... if (var) { method(var); } else { somethingelse(); }
[15:08:20] <zoned> if var is 0, null, or undefined, the else will be triggered
[15:09:08] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/9S4Ss/1/ - is there a way to make the top jQuery UI slider look like the bottom HTML5 slider without recreating it pixel by pixel but rather utilizing the default OS widgets or whatever it's called?
[15:11:50] <w00tner> Hello, can anyone help this nooblet with a json parsing with jquery ???
[15:11:59] <hjk> itatitat: .live() is deprecated, so you should not use it anyway: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:12:06] <hjk> you have many options:
[15:12:34] <hjk>   - .mouseenter() + .mouseleave()     http://api.jquery.com/?ns0=1&s=.mouseenter&go=
[15:12:47] <w00tner> I have my sweet json file. And i actually can retrieve data using console.log().
[15:12:54] <hjk>    - .delegate() (haven't tested)
[15:13:10] <hjk>    - .on
[15:13:17] <w00tner> The question is how to create the template with javascript inside the body
[15:13:33] <hjk>    - .bind
[15:13:53] <alexidoia> can I do this : $(this).parent().addClass("no-items"); ?
[15:14:33] <itatitat> guys how I can do this?:  this is wrong: jQuery(this  .title). etc.....
[15:14:54] <hjk> However, I see that live() has the property that it will be automatically attached to dynamically inserted content, so if that's a requirement for you, you shoyuld stick to the methods advised in the documentation
[15:15:45] <hjk> w00tner: json parsing is done with JSON.parse(string)
[15:16:10] <hjk> which is not part of jQuery, actually
[15:16:11] <w00tner> im using $get.JSON(file.json, function(data)
[15:16:56] <w00tner> i already have the json file, and i can retrieve data using console.log(). I just want to know how to insert this content into divs.
[15:17:00] <hjk> but does JSON.parse work?
[15:17:13] <hjk> aaaah
[15:17:27] <w00tner> using a premade template just to fill the some "dynamic content"
[15:17:50] <w00tner> this is my json file: http://www.cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json
[15:18:17] <dzajdband> w00tner yo quiero cupones!
[15:18:19] <dzajdband> jaja
[15:18:24] <w00tner> ayudame
[15:18:36] <w00tner> estoy enloqueciendo lentamente
[15:18:38] <purplexed> hey guys. I need to select all elements from a page where the attribute name starts with: data-constraint-  .. I was going for something like: $(document).find("[data-constraint-*]") .. but that's wrong. Anyone able to tell me how to construct the query correctly ?
[15:20:05] <hjk> w00tner: a plain old function with innerHTML?
[15:20:09] <hjk> er--
[15:20:24] <hjk> function that generates html, and the caller of that function injects into the document with innerhTML
[15:20:36] <hjk> it seems reasonable?
[15:21:25] <w00tner> innerHTML ok,. i will check it out
[15:21:32] <alexidoia> I'd like to get the Element Name of $this
[15:22:33] <hjk> alexidoia: got an answer, doesn't work?
[15:23:00] <alexidoia> no I have $(this).parent().is("tr"), but it returns false
[15:23:26] <gnarf> alexidoia: version?
[15:23:39] <alexidoia> of jquery ? the google one
[15:23:48] <gnarf> alexidoia: if you want "this" --- console.log( this.nodeName ) ?
[15:23:59] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/9S4Ss/2/ - is it possible making jQuery UI's slider utilize ones default OS widgets?
[15:24:12] <gnarf> alexidoia: $(this).parent()[0].nodeName
[15:24:27] <gnarf> alexidoia: $(this).parent().prop( "nodeName" )
[15:24:42] <gnarf> ?mdc nodeName
[15:24:46] <bot-t> gnarf, Node.nodeName - MDN - Returns the name of the current node as a string. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node.nodeName
[15:24:53] <alexidoia> undefined
[15:25:23] <alexidoia> I am in a td in a script element and I am looking for targetting the tr
[15:25:33] <hjk> what do you mean by 'i am in a td element'?
[15:25:45] <alexidoia> <td><script>...
[15:25:57] <ajpiano> alexidoia: scripts don't know where they are in the dom
[15:25:59] <hjk> oooh, well, that has no meaning to jquery
[15:26:09] <DukeDave> Thanks zoned
[15:26:14] <alexidoia> hjk: ah ok
[15:26:22] <alexidoia> so there is no way to get the tr
[15:26:31] <pyF-AM> you can always ID it
[15:26:42] <pyF-AM> or try to identify it by other means
[15:26:46] <hjk> select by class or id
[15:27:42] <pyF-AM> if worse comes to worse, you can document.getElementsByTagName('tr')[index]
[15:27:51] <zoned> DukeDave, just be sure that you realize that a 0 will also be treated as undefined in this case. if you want, you could say if (var === undefined || var === null)
[15:29:08] <Tiberio> hi, How can I select a element with display: none css property?
[15:29:34] <itatitat> guys, when I change the property (in my case a simple color of a text), is there any way to make the change of property with a transition?.....more slow?
[15:29:49] <gnarf> alexidoia: why are you using inline scripts at all?
[15:30:24] <gnarf> ?js 0 == undefined
[15:30:26] <bot-t> gnarf: false
[15:30:29] <gnarf> zoned: ^^^
[15:30:43] <gnarf> the only things that == undefined are undefined and null
[15:30:55] <gnarf> so === undefined || === null -> == nul
[15:31:04] <zoned> ahh
[15:33:00] <gnarf> ?js $([0, false, "", undefined, null]).map(function( index, elem ) { return elem + ": is " + ( elem ? "truthy":"falsy" ) + " and " + ( elem == null ? "==" : "!=" ) + " null";}).get()
[15:33:02] <bot-t> gnarf: ["0: is falsy and != null", "false: is falsy and != null", ": is falsy and != null", "undefined: is falsy and == null", "null: is falsy and == null"]
[15:33:45] <Tiberio> Again, I am using jasmine-jquery. The toBeHidden() matcher is to test hidden elements (they that don't comsume space in the document), but I can use select the element with display: none property
[15:37:41] <mfoxdogg|work> moring all
[15:37:52] <hjk> Tiberio: maybe http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:42:03] <purplexed> does anyone know how to select all elements, that have an attribute with a name that starts with some wildcard ?
[15:44:56] <carnau> Hello, is there any way to get the html inside a div with a class, that is inside a response.data object. It contains a lot of html, but only need that text.
[15:46:12] <carnau> like response.data = '<div class="a">hello</div><div class="clase">laksdjflaksjdfkls</div>';. Just want to get the first div.
[15:46:27] <carnau> don't know if I can use .html method
[15:46:48] <carnau> or I have to compare it with a regexp an .match()
[15:46:58] <carnau> any hints, please?
[15:49:04] <hjk> carnau: tell me if it works:      $(response.data).filter(".a").html()
[15:50:08] <hjk> I used the jQuery(html) version here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/     and .filter(): http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:51:55] <carnau> hjk, superb man, many thanks! :-)

[16:09:06] <autolycus> jjk ok let me test a few things and if not working I will ask here. thanks
[16:12:19] <hjk> Why on jsfiddle.net the $() does not accept a selector but only an id? :-/
[16:17:49] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/9S4Ss/2/ - is it possible making jQuery UI's slider utilize ones default OS widgets? Or will I have to wait until HTML5 sliders are supported by all browsers?
[16:20:50] <scar> if im using the UI for dialogs and triggers for the dialogs--- is there a way to minimize the amount of code? lets say i have a list of items and i want each item to be a link that triggers a dialog-- instead of trigger_1 through trigger_50 or whatever and dialog_1 - dialog_50, can i just create one dialog? not sure if the interaction could be done that way-- not expert in js/jquery
[16:21:35] <DukeDrake> hi
[16:22:36] <itatitat> guys I spent 2 hours with only three lines....I think is something wrong in Javascript....I tried hundredes wayt
[16:22:38] <itatitat> ways
[16:22:38] <itatitat> http://snipt.org/vsjd7#expand
[16:23:09] <itatitat> I havent error, simply doesnt work
[16:25:18] <scar> itatitat: i dont even think that code is valid lol
[16:25:30] <itatitat> no?, why?
[16:25:40] <scar> itatitat: i am no expert, but ive never seen a jquery selector like that
[16:26:17] <scar> i shouldnt be giving advice, as i have no idea if im right. sorry :\
[16:26:52] <hjk> purplexed: http://jsfiddle.net/FwtVU/
[16:26:52] <itatitat> ou, with so many corrections I forgot the selector, is true, but now I made fine, and is not working yet
[16:27:08] <itatitat> Now my selector is jQuery(div#form)
[16:27:16] <ogk1000> is it possible to ajax load a page that has scripts and then the scripts run after loaded in with ajax?
[16:28:24] <pyF-AM> itatitat: I did some testing with animate and I cannot animate a border
[16:28:35] <hjk> ogk1000: change window.location?
[16:28:47] <hjk> btw that involves no ajax
[16:28:51] <itatitat> jummmm, so....animate only animate some features?
[16:28:51] <hjk> :p
[16:29:18] <ogk1000> im trying to do:
[16:29:18] <ogk1000> 				$('#widgetsc').load('http://ogkex.com/wp-content/themes/ogk/weather-widgets.html');
[16:29:25] <pyF-AM> itatitat: I have only used animate on certain css properties like top, left, opacity
[16:29:28] <ogk1000> but it wont load the generated widgets
[16:29:53] <itatitat> jummmmm, but for example im trying to change the background of a div when I make mouseover
[16:29:57] <itatitat> but is not working......
[16:30:12] <pyF-AM> you can use:  $('#id').css('border', '2px solid red');  //but it won't animate
[16:31:10] <hjk> You could try the css transition, but it is only supported in chrome and firefox atm
[16:31:28] <hjk> last msg was @itatitat
[16:31:38] <pyF-AM> i don't think jquery can animate css:background either
[16:32:01] <ogk1000> it for sure can pyF-AM but you need a plugin
[16:32:37] <ogk1000> are you trying to do color or image
[16:32:55] <ogk1000> itatitat, what are you trying to change exactly
[16:33:07] <pyF-AM> he was trying border
[16:33:11] <ogk1000> borderColor
[16:33:24] <itatitat> I've a div, I want to change the background slowly when I make hover or mouseover
[16:33:35] <ogk1000> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[16:33:41] <demersdesigns> animate in jquery UI will do that
[16:33:43] <pyF-AM> $('.infos').animate({borderColor : '2px solid red'}, 'slow');  // does not work
[16:33:48] <DukeDrake> is it possible to delay the actions triggered by .hover()? E.g.: if I move the mouse out within 500ms the action shouldn't be triggered...
[16:33:52] <DukeDrake> =
[16:33:54] <ogk1000> no need for UI just use that plugin
[16:33:58] <ogk1000> >>>> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[16:34:11] <pyF-AM> cool
[16:34:31] <ogk1000> may want to do .stop().animate()
[16:34:37] <ogk1000> I like .stop(true,true).animate
[16:34:41] <itatitat> ou.....................thats new for me....thanks
[16:35:09] <hjk> ogk1000: look at the additional notes http://api.jquery.com/load/
[16:35:33] <hjk> looks like the widgets are belong to http://netweather.accuweather.com
[16:35:43] <hjk> (according to the widget page source)
[16:35:51] <ogk1000> yes
[16:36:04] <ogk1000> so any thoughts on how to make that work ?
[16:36:21] <ogk1000> I dont want them loaded on page view unless someone physically calls for them
[16:36:33] <hjk> an iframe?
[16:36:51] <ogk1000> .prepend('<iframe>') ?
[16:37:07] <hjk> .innerHTML +="<iframe> ... "
[16:37:25] <ogk1000> can you give me a more specfic example
[16:39:43] <DukeDrake> is it possible to delay the actions triggered by .hover()? E.g.: if I move the mouse out within 500ms the action shouldn't be triggered...
[16:40:27] <ogk1000> DukeDrake, you can use setTimeout
[16:40:40] <ogk1000> instead of $(foo).animate
[16:40:55] <ogk1000> setTimeout(function() { // do something }, 500 );
[16:41:04] <DukeDrake> hm
[16:41:07] <DukeDrake> mhhh .....
[16:41:18] <ogk1000> not sure if thats best practice but it would def work
[16:41:27] <DukeDrake> no .. 'delay' is probably not the correct term =)
[16:41:40] <ogk1000> well delay doesnt always work from my experience
[16:41:46] <DukeDrake> no
[16:41:54] <ogk1000> and delay is based on setTimeout
[16:42:04] <ogk1000> if u search jquery core for delay you will see
[16:42:07] <DukeDrake> I want to avoid the actions to be triggered at all, if user moves out in time
[16:42:20] <pyF-AM> you can do this:  var delay = setTimeout(function() { //stuff }
[16:42:23] <DukeDrake> i.e. cancles the hover event
[16:42:32] <pyF-AM> then if user moves out:  clearTimeout(delay)
[16:43:12] <DukeDrake> ah! =)
[16:43:37] <ogk1000> DukeDrake, you may want to look into hoverIntent plugin http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[16:43:49] <pyF-AM> plugins for everything... geeze
[16:44:16] <pyF-AM> plugins just mean importing 95% more code than you really need
[16:44:32] <ogk1000> better than making the core bulkier than you need
[16:44:43] <ogk1000> and we are talking like 5-20-30kb ?
[16:45:01] <hjk> ogk1000: http://jsfiddle.net/hkrER/
[16:45:21] <DukeDrake> pyF-AM: sounds good
[16:46:43] <hjk> I would have done a plain, simple .html(), but again, it was forbid by the same-origin policy.
[16:48:53] <ogk1000> tryign this now hjk seems legit
[16:52:22] <DukeDrake> doesn't work o.o
[16:53:08] <DukeDrake> errr .. no... it DOES work! =D
[16:54:55] <ogk1000> which worked best DukeDrake
[16:55:24] <ogk1000> hjk, I ended up grabbing the generated code
[16:55:28] <ogk1000> and ajax is working now
[16:55:46] <ogk1000> so it supports flash embeds just no JS
[16:55:50] <hjk> what is generated?
[16:55:56] <ogk1000> http://ogkex.com/wp-content/themes/ogk/weather-widgets.html
[16:56:19] <ogk1000> the scripts wrote an object tag so im just hardcoding the object tags to html file
[16:56:31] <ogk1000> but your way is great if thats not an option
[16:57:19] <hjk> does this mean it will be loaded even if the user does not physically call for it?
[16:57:38] <hjk> what do you mean by "if that's not an option"?
[16:58:28] <ogk1000> meaning if you wnat to load JS file with ajax or .html
[16:58:33] <ogk1000> use your attr src solution
[16:58:38] <ogk1000> if no other option
[16:58:50] <hjk> h got it
[16:59:13] <ogk1000> smart thinking... weird how .html doesnt allow external JS either
[17:01:16] <hjk> goodnight guys
[17:03:54] <michael> Hi guys. What is a good image slider plugin for jqm?

[17:08:38] <ogk1000> Michael, what is jqm
[17:09:05] <Michael> jquery mobile sorry
[17:09:25] <ogk1000> hmm I would think cycle plugin still but not sure

[18:49:44] <azbyin> hi all.. how to check if an element is visible?
[18:49:59] <azbyin> $("#myid").is(":visible") ?
[18:52:43] <rmurphey> ?tias
[18:52:52] <azbyin> works and doesn;t work :(
[18:52:57] <azbyin> which is driving me kinda nuts :)
[18:53:03] <tw2113> come on bot
[18:53:35] <azbyin> for a hidden div, if i check, it says false. which is nice. then i make the div visible and it shows true.  which is good
[18:53:48] <azbyin> then i hide the div, now it says true!
[18:54:12] <rmurphey> azbyin: can you put together a fiddle that shows the issue?
[18:54:18] <azbyin> i will try now
[18:56:03] <coldhead> listen for the victories / they always come quietly
[19:11:42] <tronhammer> hey guys, i'm running into an issue, and i'm wondering if it's my approach, or a valid bug in the 1.7.2 sizzle engine
[19:12:14] <tronhammer> I'm attempting to determine if a block of text has any nodes in it by evaluating it with standard $() call
[19:12:53] <tronhammer> so something like $("<type></type>").length == 1 would notify that there are valid nodes in the text
[19:13:18] <tronhammer> but when something like $("hey there :)"); is evaluated, the sizzle engine trips and triggers a syntax error
[19:13:36] <rmurphey> tronhammer: $('<type></type>') would try to create a type element
[19:13:39] <rmurphey> it would not select one
[19:13:52] <rmurphey> $('hey there :)') would try to make a selection
[19:13:55] <rmurphey> and it would fail miserably
[19:14:01] <tronhammer> very true, that example was just to determine if there are nodes, then we continue by parsing them out
[19:14:05] <tronhammer> ah
[19:14:37] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[19:14:51] <rmurphey> that is a good place to start
[19:15:18] <tronhammer> :O i see!
[19:15:25] <rmurphey> if you are looking to see whether, say, a div #foo has any children .bar
[19:15:34] <rmurphey> then you could do $('#foo .bar').length
[19:15:39] <tronhammer> dang, some sanitizing to be done
[19:15:44] <rmurphey> if you are looking to do text matching then you want to use :contains
[19:16:27] <tronhammer> well, for this case, we're getting a private message, which can contain plain text, or an xml string that has associated object info
[19:16:46] <tronhammer> and so we were originally do the xml evaluation by seeing if jQuery could parse any valid nodes from the string
[19:17:16] <tronhammer> but 1.7.2 barfs on that do to the ":" being a reserved character
[19:17:21] <ajpiano> damntr http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[19:17:21] <tronhammer> due*
[19:17:24] <ajpiano> tronhammer: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[19:17:44] <tronhammer> :O!!  why didn't google reveal this to me?
[19:18:04] <tronhammer> four stack overflow questions, and none even shined a light on that :|
[19:18:18] <tronhammer> thanks much
[19:24:45] <azbyin> jquery :visible works by checking the display property on the element!!
[19:25:16] <azbyin> grr.. so there isn;t support to check if an element is visibility: visible or visibility:hidden
[19:25:30] <azbyin> i don;tknow why it is setup this way
[19:26:35] <azbyin> if you are going to always be doing display:none;  to display:block;   then the checking selector shouldn;t be ":visible" but ":display" or something
[19:28:02] <rmurphey> ajpiano: aren't you supposed to be visualizing things with the javascripts?
[19:28:27] <ajpiano> i decided to play video games instead, i might get up and work tonight
[19:28:32] <ajpiano> oh wait this isn't us iming
[19:28:34] <ajpiano> it's #jquery
[19:28:34] <ajpiano> :p
[19:28:36] <rmurphey> good plan
[19:33:19] <mogaal> Hi, I need your help. I am "alerting" (alert function) the following line: $('fieldset[name=contenedor_exp_apn_indiv]:visible:last input[type=text][name~="exp_apn_cargo"]').val() but I get undefined, when I change the name by complete name (without "regex" ~= ) all work perfect. Any ideas?
[19:41:24] <mogaal> forget it, I solve with filter()
[19:41:37] <mogaal> but is weird that not work with the other method
[19:43:29] <coldhead> that's a pretty crazy selector
[19:52:46] <kurol> you can give fieldsets names?

[20:43:50] <coldhead> not easily, Guilherme
[20:44:13] <coldhead> you have to keep track of where everything else is and how much space they take up
[20:45:34] <Guilherme> yeah, it's the best i could think
[20:45:57] <Guilherme> put every new valid position in an array
[20:46:19] <coldhead> Guilherme: maybe take a look at jquery masonry
[20:46:21] <johnkpaul> Guilherme: is every image the same size?
[20:46:34] <coldhead> if you can't use it exactly you can borrow their code at least maybe

[20:49:45] <lakshmi> Hi
[20:51:01] <lakshmi> I'm using dropdown in the jqueryui tab. i open the popup and navigate to the next tab. when i change the tab, the popup is still shown
[20:51:18] <lakshmi> may i know how can i avoid this issue?
[20:52:01] <lakshmi> i have used document.click event to close the popup. but when i use the dropdown inside the tab, the event did not fire
[20:52:49] <johnkpaul> lakshmi jquery ui tabs have specialized events that you can add handlers to
[20:53:08] <johnkpaul> lakshmi: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ click on the "Events" tab
[20:53:12] <Crimlo> member:identifier:guilherme: use the z-index duh
[20:53:34] <johnkpaul> you can add a handler to "show" that closes your popup
[20:53:49] <Guilherme> Crimlo, how could z-index prevent this?
[20:54:56] <lakshmi> is there anyother method to avoid this issue?
[20:55:08] <lakshmi> is it possible to override the jquery events?
[20:56:41] <lakshmi> y does the jquery tab select event prevents other events?
[20:58:29] <Guilherme> i think i've solved my problem, a guy from another channel give me the suggestion to use a collision library and i found it http://sourceforge.net/projects/jquerycollision/
[21:03:25] <lakshmi> any solution?
[21:04:19] <lakshmi> w

[21:16:37] <amal_> Hi al, i am trying to develop a jquery mobile application and i am using iframes to load websites into an iframe. Iframe doesnot work when it is in another virtual page of jquery mobile application. Help me please.
[21:24:28] <Anime> hi. i was trying to find a way of using templates with jquery and found this plugin http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/, but since its dropped what's an actual way of doing it today?
[21:33:23] <znf> Hello. I have a small question about a pre-made javascript "lava lamp menu". This is the code in question: http://pastebin.com/DUfK8skv
[21:35:39] <znf> My issue is that I can have up to 2 menus on a page, the app I use appends _selected to the class of the currently active element. The thing is that one menu can have menu and append _selected, so it becomes menu_selected, the other can have configmenu and configmenu_selected. How can I add a condition or something like that for the same code to work on multiple types of menus? code in cause is at line 13)
[21:36:42] <znf> I can't change the html code as it's generated by an app that I can't modify (unless I want to recompile everything, which would defeat my initial purpose of theming that app)
[21:38:17] <tw2113> i imagine you could use some regex selection to select all that end in _selected
[21:42:01] <zxc> znf: maybe I am wrong, but as far as I know, addClass adds a separate class. Thus you are not adding _selected to the class, you are adding a separte class. I.e. you finally have 2 classes menu menuselected.
[21:42:51] <znf> zxc, the code is adding menu_selected, yes
[21:42:58] <zxc> Which is actually far better, because you can independently select .menu and .menu_selected.
[21:43:06] <tw2113> li[class$="_selected"] ?
[21:43:16] <zxc> and thus have code that runs selectively for one of them or both of them.
[21:43:31] <znf> zxc, I'm not sure I understand
[21:44:27] <amal_> Hi al, i am trying to develop a jquery mobile application and i am using iframes to load websites into an iframe. Iframe doesnot work when it is in another virtual page of jquery mobile application. Help me please.
[21:45:10] <znf> I'm really confused by that || and $li[0], not that "fluent" in javascript
[21:45:57] <tw2113> || means OR
[21:46:08] <tw2113> $li is the variable name
[21:46:09] <znf> uhm, do I need something special for :regexp ?
[21:46:12] <tw2113> [0] references the index value
[21:46:18] <znf> I get unrecognized expression
[21:46:46] <zxc> Now I think I am completely wrong, please ignore my above comments.
[21:48:05] <zxc> sorry.
[21:49:28] <znf> zxc, my program replaces menu with menu_selected, or configmenu with configmenu_selected, I never need to query both independently
[21:49:42] <znf> when was :regexp implemented?
[21:49:54] <znf> Seems I'm running a really old jQuery and it doesn't have it
[21:50:23] <zxc> yes, in fact I misunderstood both the request and the line, please ignore my comments above.
[21:52:31] <znf> tw2113, so... where exactly is :regex from? :-/
[21:53:07] <znf> Oh, dear god
[21:53:17] <znf> I'm so dumb... I was reading about a regex plugin for jQuery
[21:53:41] <quazimodo> hay hay
[21:55:09] <quazimodo> guys I'm looking for a jquery plugin, it is like a div slider/carousel. The idea is that say you have 4 divs with images/other dis in them, and they stack up over each other on the right, with the 1st dive showing on the left. As you mous over the edges of the stacked divs to the right, they slide over to the left and are shown
[21:55:14] <quazimodo> I cant find this plugin anywhere
[21:55:36] <quazimodo> http://wwwm.coventry.ac.uk/Pages/index.aspx
[21:55:52] <quazimodo> it is very much like this effect, only the left most div is shown by default
[21:58:03] <zxc> .animate()
[21:58:36] <zxc> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[21:59:18] <zxc> + hover() of course http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[22:01:31] <zxc> As a side note, actually I see, by default, all the divs with the left edges separated by a fixed amount, so no special "left div", but I don't know if that's what it's intended to be for
[22:02:13] <zxc> quazimodo: ^^
[22:03:28] <znf> Would anyone know why this plugin throws an error for me? http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[22:03:45] <znf> I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '3' of undefined "
[22:04:39] <coldhead> its probably written for an older version of jQuery
[22:04:48] <coldhead> some internals may have changed
[22:05:01] <coldhead> can you downgrade jQ to an earlier version and see if that works?
[22:05:45] <znf> I guess I can, any idea what version of jQuery would that be written for, in 2009?
[22:07:12] <coldhead> 1.3
[22:07:20] <znf> mhm, just tried it, same thing :-/
[22:07:49] <coldhead> it works for me here: http://jsfiddle.net/wTD2j/1/
[22:07:56] <coldhead> maybe you copy pasted wrong?
[22:08:36] <znf> I'll try it again
[22:09:46] <znf> yeah, weird, how could I have copied badly *ponders*
[22:10:08] <znf> tw2113, thanks, that sugestion worked!
[22:10:22] <znf> thank you, too, coldhead
[22:10:34] <tw2113> thank coldhead more
[22:10:41] <tw2113> he's the one that helped you get it working
[22:10:46] <tw2113> i just got the thought process going
[22:11:28] <coldhead> i think we can all agree that we are amongst the finest fellows that ever were
[22:11:32] <coldhead> and good job, take 5
[22:11:39] * znf gives cookies to everyone
[22:11:56] <tw2113> goes good with dr. pepper
[22:13:47] <Jagan_> Hi.
[22:14:27] <tw2113> yo
[22:15:37] <znf> I'm telling you, never let C write HTML in any form...
[22:15:41] <znf> erm
[22:15:48] <znf> never let C coders write HTML in any form, there fixed
[22:16:11] <Jagan_> if i press enter key in email , password input it will call login button. But this is affecting on autofill, if i press enter key it call login? how to restrict that
[22:18:22] <zxc> stupid question: why pressing enter key while autofiling?
[22:18:46] <zxc> [    for clarity: I mean, mine is a stupida question    ]
[22:19:44] <zxc> [     or, I guess it is, since there must be a reason but I am not able to see it     ]
[22:23:44] <znf> isn't autofil basically saying "here, have this form fully completed, just press login?"
[22:23:50] <znf> or I'm not understanding it, either  :P
[22:25:53] <znf> anyone knows of a ready-to-apply CSS for form-controls styling?
[22:27:03] <znf> (with no images)
[22:37:43] <ENQ> znf have you tryed bootstrap?
[22:38:10] <znf> ENQ, yup, but I can't use LESS in this project
[22:38:30] <ENQ> then dont use it?
[22:38:37] <znf> I'm assuming you're referring to  http://markdotto.com/bootstrap ?
[22:38:39] <ENQ> use compiled version?
[22:39:07] <znf> but how does that help me with forms? :)
[22:39:31] <znf> last time I checked that didn't style forms
[22:39:39] <ENQ> well it is :/
[22:39:53] <ENQ> its they are pretty
[22:40:42] <ENQ> be back later :)
[22:41:51] <tw2113> i think he was suggesting stealing the ready-made css
[22:42:17] <znf> I think he was also referring to http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[22:42:27] <tw2113> same idea, different source
[22:42:57] <znf> yeah, I know what he means by using the compiled one
[22:43:51] <tw2113> https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/forms.less
[22:43:52] <znf> just that I never seen that bootstrap gitpage :)
[22:44:23] <tw2113> may have to spend a little bit of time removing the LESS bits
[22:44:39] <tw2113> or just go with the compiled end result
[22:45:21] <BlowMyWhistle> yo
[22:45:24] <znf> yeah, I'll compile it, I guess :)
[22:46:31] <znf> Although it's not exactly what I want... it seems that it only pretty much styles input forms in chrome :-/
[22:47:50] <BlowMyWhistle> znf: put the song titled "blow my whistle". it will help you program better.
[22:50:11] <quazimodo> zxc: yeah i guessi ts a jquery accordion
[22:51:04] <znf> BlowMyWhistle, wut?
[22:54:12] <zxc> Actually, I find music with a lot of words and rhytm very distracting. I have to think about the words in the code, not the words of the song.
[22:54:46] <beancurd> zxc: because you not gangstar enough.
[22:55:12] <coldhead> i also find instrumentals more conducive
[22:55:27] <coldhead> no need to tie up the speech processing parts of your brain
[22:55:32] <coldhead> you might need them for debugging
[23:00:10] <coldhead> the best album for debugging is tortoise's millions now living will never die
[23:00:16] <coldhead> that is a scientific fact
[23:01:39] <jayant> how did you guys manage to go through all those events and selectors and remember them all
[23:02:42] <coldhead> you look them up, mostly
[23:02:48] <coldhead> and eventually remember them with practice
[23:06:55] <zxc> open http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ then Ctrl+F (find) "name of selector"
[23:08:30] <zxc> also, looking them up for helping others with issues is a pretty good exercise
[23:09:13] <zxc> which is one of the reasons I spend so much time in a jquery channel :p some issues are css-related and actually not jquery-related so...
[23:10:23] <zxc> It's like, "how do you remember all the rules of javascript?" >> don't remember them, just ask Google :p
[23:18:31] <azbyin> is it possible to set a callback on change of an element's css ?
[23:18:55] <azbyin> basically, i want to detect a change from visibility:hidden to visibility:visible
[23:27:19] <ENQ> azbyin, idk such event, are you making thes changes yourself?
[23:28:02] <azbyin> what do you mean  by "are you making these changes yourself"?
[23:28:32] <azbyin> i'm not changing jquery itself. i simply want a 'csspropertychanged' event on which i can bind a callback
[23:28:36] <ENQ> are you hiding element by calling function?
[23:28:44] <azbyin> someone else is!
[23:37:26] <ENQ> azbyin, have you tryed this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1397251/event-detect-when-css-property-changed-using-jquery?
[23:58:21] <zxc> enq, azbyin: "That event is deprecated in w3c. It must be another way. â€“ ccsakuweb Jul 2 at 6:55" (cit.)
[23:58:33] <ENQ> hmm
[23:58:34] <zxc> from answer's comments
[23:58:46] <ENQ> then there is no way
[23:58:56] <ENQ> except to trigger it yourself
[23:59:22] <ENQ> or extend addClass, removeClass and css functions, so they trigger something
[23:59:30] <azbyin> how does one add an event listener with jquery ?
[23:59:54] <azbyin> i mean in addition to whatever event listeners that might already exist
