[00:10:56] <ItsJustMe> Okay, off-topic .. Does someone know an irc-client without status-messages? who cares about who has quit or joined?
[00:11:43] <dogmatic69> ItsJustMe: most clients can disable that.
[00:11:46] <ItsJustMe> oh - I am using windows xp ^^
[00:11:52] <ItsJustMe> mine cannot ._.
[00:11:59] <dogmatic69> xchat does for one.
[00:13:09] <ItsJustMe> okay, i'll install it .. thx
[00:13:45] <NodeX> You can turn off things like that on Mirc
[00:14:37] <ItsJustMe> i saw mirc years ago .. more playground than irc i think :D
[00:16:10] <ItsJustMe> rejoin - see ya (:
[00:25:40] <ItsJustMe> Woop Woop - No more join messages :) Thanks again! :D
[00:26:49] <Borre> Can someone help me with some JSON stuff?
[00:28:01] <Hooloovoo> Borre: just ask away
[00:28:13] <Hooloovoo> someone will answer... eventually.
[00:28:28] <Borre> Okay. First time here, so.. :P
[00:28:56] <Borre> Anyways, my code doesn't give any result while there actually is data on the requested file.. http://jsfiddle.net/TyZQ4/
[00:29:44] <Hooloovoo> Borre: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.q-music.be/1.1/events. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[00:30:47] <Borre> Hmm
[00:30:57] <BinaryKitten> Borre  is the url yours?
[00:31:20] <Borre> no, but I have an FTP account where it probably will connect
[00:31:24] <Borre> I'll try it out
[00:32:04] <BinaryKitten> ftp to the api?
[00:32:55] <Borre> no, I have acces to their library where I can connect
[00:33:50] <BinaryKitten> ok, if they don't have a JSONP connection you can't access it without messing with CORRS or a serverside proxy on your server
[00:34:36] <BinaryKitten> (sorry CORS - 2 Rs = Band)
[00:34:39] <raj> is the success handler synchronous?
[00:34:45] <raj> for ajax
[00:35:01] <raj> like, does everything I put in the success handler's function occur in order
[00:35:14] <BinaryKitten> everything o
[00:35:21] <raj> cool :)
[00:35:29] <raj> thanks
[00:35:34] <BinaryKitten> everything inside the function happens in the typical way js uses functions
[00:35:57] <BinaryKitten> it's just the triggering of it that happens outside
[00:36:47] <Borre> This should normally work: http://jsfiddle.net/Q9tZ6/ (websocket is included in this one)
[00:37:20] <jessica> raj can you help me please
[00:37:22] <Hooloovoo> raj: unless you put another asynchronous function there.
[00:37:56] <aqeel> hi room
[00:39:49] <ItsJustMe> Hi aqeel :) how r u?
[00:40:03] <aqeel> fine thanks
[00:40:10] <Borre> the weird thing is, if I use file_get_contents() in PHP on that URL, it actually works..
[00:40:18] <Borre> Or is that a different kind of request?
[00:41:30] <Cork> Borre: browsers doesn't let you do cross domain ajax calls
[00:42:03] <Cork> Borre: unless the target server is configured to send cors headers (and then it just works in modern browsers)
[00:44:09] <Borre> mkay, thx! ;)
[00:46:01] <jessica> http://jsfiddle.net/BZY5y/8/    , can any1 help me here
[00:46:54] <Cork> jessica: you need to ask a question for anyone to be able to help you
[00:47:46] <jessica> is my php code ok ?? i am not getting result of my json return value
[00:48:15] <Cork> what you're php generates isn't in that fiddle
[00:50:38] <jessica> this is my php code
[00:50:40] <jessica> http://pastebin.com/rYB4VTjC
[00:50:55] <fRAiLtY-> jessica:  Please don't use mysql_* functions
[00:51:08] <fRAiLtY-> But that's not for this channel
[00:51:38] <Cork> jessica: i meant the generated json structure, not the php code
[00:51:38] <jessica> actually my prob is  jquery and php mixture kind of, so askin help
[00:51:58] <Cork> jessica: so check them each at at time
[00:52:16] <Cork> don't try to look at the php and understand why jquery can't handle the response
[00:52:28] <Cork> look at the generated json and try to understand what happens
[00:52:34] <jessica> kk
[00:53:35] <Borre> fRAiLtY- why wouldn't she use mysql_* funcs?
[00:53:51] <fRAiLtY-> Deprecated? Use mysqli_ if you have to or ideally PDO
[00:54:08] <Hooloovoo> php should be depricated >:|
[00:54:20] <Cork> Borre: you should use mysqli not the old mysql driver
[00:54:32] <BinaryKitten> oh lol woo someone made a php joke now we can all fall about laughing
[00:54:42] <fRAiLtY-> lol
[00:54:42] <Hooloovoo> \o/
[00:55:22] <Cork> Borre: http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.statements.php
[00:55:29] <Borre> mkay, any arguments?
[00:55:43] <BinaryKitten> Hooloovoo much of php has been deprecated. Unfortunately big name companies don't like it when little up start open source things take away functionality they use in their big project
[00:55:49] <aqeel> jquery 1.8.3 is out, last night was not there......where can i see the chnage log
[00:56:03] <BinaryKitten> urm wait is Borre === Jee5us_w ?
[00:56:06] <BinaryKitten> ooop
[00:56:09] <Borre> No, lol
[00:56:11] <BinaryKitten> urm wait is Borre === jessica ?
[00:56:39] <Cork> Borre: cause the it leads to a much cleaner workflow, and simpler code
[00:56:45] <BinaryKitten> seems to have 2 people asking similar things.. and people commenting cross-origin
[00:56:48] <Cork> Borre: anyway wrong channel for that talk
[00:56:57] <Borre> allright
[00:57:01] <Hooloovoo> BinaryKitten: php is not little up start
[00:57:28] <BinaryKitten> lol Hooloovoo
[00:57:32] <Cork> BinaryKitten: the second person asked cause of the response to the first question
[00:57:34] <Cork> so...
[00:58:12] <BinaryKitten> Cork yup .. but it's early and my brain was left behind in bed. Also it's my 1st day with jQueries
[00:58:35] <Cork> BinaryKitten: long day then :)
[00:59:13] <BinaryKitten> oooh yes
[00:59:18] <BinaryKitten> always
[00:59:43] <Cork> cause i've seen you in here for months ;P
[01:00:07] <Borre> I've been able to make the connection btw. ;-)
[01:01:26] <BinaryKitten> damn. foiled, papered and clingwrapped
[01:01:40] * BinaryKitten departs for the office
[01:01:44] <ItsJustMe> Why does the IRC get logged to public?
[01:01:54] <BinaryKitten> ItsJustMe why not?
[01:02:09] <BinaryKitten> it's a public channel and it's a lot easier to search
[01:02:24] <ItsJustMe> oh, okay :)
[01:02:33] <Borre> ItsJustMe just has secrets for the public world
[01:02:40] <ItsJustMe> never needed to search something :P
[01:02:42] <Borre> He wants to spread some terrorism here
[01:02:45] <ItsJustMe> xD
[01:02:49] <ItsJustMe> sure :)
[01:02:51] <Borre> :P
[01:02:59] <Borre> I have a lot of fantasy
[01:02:59] <Borre> ;D
[01:03:06] <ItsJustMe> but it does not work here .. so I'll spread it in the js-channel :P
[01:03:06] <BinaryKitten> Borre now we're gonna get raided cause you used the T word
[01:03:36] * Borre hides somewhere in a corner
[01:05:12] * ItsJustMe meanwhile tries to manage his code xD
[01:08:11] * ItsJustMe desperately deletes all his work.
[01:08:18] <ItsJustMe> I'm kidding myself all the time -.-
[01:09:37] <Borre> That sucks

[01:15:42] <Cork> aqeel: ?
[01:16:04] <selectable> Hi all, could someone give an advice to me about how to combine jquery ui selectable and text selection?
[01:16:13] <aqeel> jquery 1.8.3....surprised me
[01:16:27] <selectable> So i have boxes, and i would like to keep the user to be able to select text in the box, but to be able to multiselect boxes
[01:16:31] <Cork> aqeel: its in the subject of the channel
[01:16:33] <aqeel> last night i was looking through their documents and then now
[01:16:53] <Cork> jQuery 1.8.3 http://jquery.com | jQuery UI 1.9.1 http://jqueryui.com | jQuery Mobile 1.2 http://jquerymobile.com <--
[01:17:08] <aqeel> thanks...but i am too excited
[01:17:21] <aqeel> i am like WOW
[01:17:37] <ItsJustMe> but why?
[01:17:47] <ItsJustMe> it stands there like about 1 or 2 weeks? :D

[01:19:36] <SmallCode> Hello fellow coders
[01:19:39] <SmallCode> !motd
[01:19:40] <SmallCode> motd
[01:19:43] <SmallCode> okay
[01:19:58] <SmallCode> What is the best way to do this
[01:20:02] <SmallCode> I have comments
[01:20:05] <fRAiLtY-> If I'm in a <dt> element and I want the "next" or associated <dd> element to toggle, how so? $$('dd:first-child').toggle(); doesn't work and if I do $$('dd').first().toggle(); it just toggles the first dd element on the page
[01:20:19] <SmallCode> In a comment box, when page loads, it pulls up 5 comments
[01:20:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: is the dd a child of the dt?
[01:21:10] <Cork> don't remember the dt/dd relation at the top of my head...
[01:21:48] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Looks like this: http://pastie.org/5441490
[01:21:56] <fRAiLtY-> I click the title I want the dd to show/hide
[01:22:14] <Cork> so $(this).nextAll('dd').first().toggle()
[01:22:34] <Trisox> what is the best way to convert video to mp4 ogv and webm
[01:22:37] <Trisox> mornign Cork
[01:22:47] <Cork> g'morning
[01:23:02] <SmallCode> Hi trisox
[01:23:14] <Cork> Trisox: if you have the raw video just do it in the encoder
[01:23:16] <SmallCode> If you are looking to convert it, you might want to try flash media server
[01:23:32] <Cork> all of them are lossy so you don't want to convert if you don't have to
[01:23:33] <Trisox> no flash :)
[01:23:48] <Trisox> i have to ...
[01:24:05] <Trisox> now using miro http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/
[01:24:18] <SmallCode> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEncoder
[01:24:40] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys
[01:24:47] <SmallCode> Oh wait were you trying to do this through php
[01:24:51] <SmallCode> Or just on your computer?
[01:24:56] <Trisox> computer
[01:24:56] <Trisox> :)
[01:24:59] <SmallCode> Oh sorry
[01:25:03] <MiracleBlue> Derp
[01:25:46] <selectable> Seems solved (found cancel option)
[01:26:02] <Cork> Trisox: you could give handbrake a try
[01:26:09] <Trisox> oke
[01:26:19] <Cork> ?g handbrake transkode
[01:26:22] <bot-t> Cork, HandBrake - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HandBrake
[01:26:48] <MiracleBlue> Ooh
[01:26:57] <MiracleBlue> What is it?
[01:27:43] <aqeel> frailty $("dt").click(function(){$("dd").toggle();});
[01:28:02] <Cork> aqeel: that will toggle all dd
[01:28:08] <Cork> and that not what he asked for
[01:28:28] <aqeel> then use id for specific
[01:28:36] <Cork> yuck
[01:28:38] <Cork> why?
[01:28:39] <Trisox> ill go with miro
[01:28:57] <Cork> aqeel: $(this).nextAll('dd').first().toggle() will do it just fine
[01:29:20] <aqeel> yup, but i thought that might just be too much...
[01:29:26] <aqeel> for the person...
[01:29:34] <Cork> too much?
[01:29:44] <CalvinMcGee> If i have the following object, http://pastebin.com/LKcxn5qv , and I wan't to do $.each() over $SSDBonus['SEK'], can I be sure that they will always be in the same sequence (121000, 45750, 0)? I know that arrays keep track of index, but that doesn't seem to be applicable here.
[01:29:46] <Cork> if finds the next dd and toggles it
[01:30:02] <aqeel> chaining and the functions used
[01:30:13] <aqeel> MUST be in sspecific order as well
[01:30:41] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: objects is always in the same order in js
[01:30:58] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: if they differ its prob from the language that generates it
[01:31:11] <CalvinMcGee> Cork: Ok, thanks!
[01:31:29] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: and same order is the order it was added in the object
[01:34:41] <Laban> Hello
[01:35:34] <Laban> I'm using jQuery autocomplete, and for some reason the completed fields are not passed on to the server after jQuery has done its job. Seems the fields are renamed and contain leading space. Any clue on how to fix this?
[01:36:45] <Cork> autocomplete does't submit anything to the server (except for the request used to fill the dropdown)
[01:36:49] <raj> yes jessica, what's up?
[01:36:59] <raj> hey there Cork
[01:36:59] <Cork> Laban: so its prob another part of the code that messes up
[01:37:02] <Cork> o/
[01:37:18] <raj> what happened to your right arm?
[01:37:39] <Cork> i usually just wave with them one at a time
[01:37:51] <raj> .o/
[01:37:56] <Laban> Hm...
[01:38:01] <Cork> heh
[01:38:08] <raj> yeah, but you should have a shoulder for the rest out of view =P
[01:38:12] <raj> i dunno, just pulling your leg
[01:38:20] <Cork> lol
[01:40:52] <raj> will hide() reverse the applied styles from fadeIn()?
[01:40:55] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  That didn't work :x
[01:41:07] <raj> or is there something more exact?
[01:41:19] <raj> I don't want to use fadeOut, because I want it to be immediate
[01:41:27] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: where are you calling it from?
[01:41:31] <raj> preferrably without fadeOut(0)
[01:41:32] <luky_vj> raj : Can you explain it more ?
[01:41:40] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: a click on the dt or where?
[01:42:03] <fRAiLtY-> on click on the dt
[01:42:08] <jessica> hii ray
[01:42:09] <Laban> gdmnit... A missplaced " screwed the code up... Thanks Cork.
[01:42:11] <jessica> raj
[01:42:23] <jessica> my this line in php has errors, can you help me- $query = mysql_query("select phno from phonebook where contactname=($_POST['name'])");
[01:42:58] <luky_vj> its a jquery channel @jessica
[01:43:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and $('dt').click(function() { $(this).nextAll('dd').first().toggle(); }); doesn't work?
[01:43:13] <Borre> JesseCW
[01:43:23] <raj> I'm fading an element in. The element already has the class 'content'. As a callback for fadeIn, I add the class 'active' onto it. '.content' has `display:none` and '.active' has `display:inline`. So basically I just wanna be able to remove '.active' and have it disappear
[01:43:31] <Borre> jessica: try contactname = '".$_POST['name']."'
[01:43:39] <Borre> but this is the jquery channel, so
[01:43:41] <raj> but because of the fadeIn, `display:block` lingers
[01:43:52] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Do I need a on click with that?
[01:43:54] <Cork> jessica: ##php is the channel you want
[01:44:09] <luky_vj> raj try : .style.opacity(0)
[01:44:13] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it needs to be in a click event for it to have the reference for this
[01:44:28] <luky_vj> or something which not interfer with your jquery code
[01:44:31] <fRAiLtY-> ? So <a href="#" onclick="?"> ?
[01:44:34] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, WordPress › Support » Having trouble with jQuery variable scope in ... - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/having-trouble-with-jquary-variable-scope-in-an-image-upload-plugin#" onclick="?"> ?
[01:44:35] <jessica> Borre>, thanks, you rock
[01:44:39] <Cork> ouch no
[01:44:44] <luky_vj> prefer a onclick yeah
[01:44:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: not inline event attributes
[01:44:55] <Borre> ;-)
[01:45:40] <raj> luky_vj, is that the exact opposite?
[01:45:50] <raj> will that basically reset that element back to its original styles?
[01:46:00] <luky_vj> raj: nope
[01:46:02] <raj> as it was before I put .active onto it and before I faded it in?
[01:46:09] <raj> ok, so how can I go back to status quo?
[01:46:19] <raj> or what's the best way to approach this?
[01:46:23] <luky_vj> can you paste your code on jsfiddle and send me it ?
[01:46:29] <raj> sure
[01:46:34] <luky_vj> thanks
[01:46:57] <Cork> raj: you could set css('display', '')
[01:47:21] <Cork> but if you hide it through .hide() jquery should do the correct thing by default
[01:47:43] <SmallCode> Anyone know a good way to do jQuery comment loading, I dont want to load the same comments over again
[01:47:58] <luky_vj> yes you could, personnaly i use onclick="style.opacity(0)"
[01:48:10] <Cork> ...
[01:48:17] <Cork> don't use inline event attributes
[01:48:18] <raj> Cork, meaning undo the styles of fadeIn, without adding any additional styles form js?
[01:48:36] <Cork> it creates a hell of a situation later if you ever want to use modern event listeners
[01:48:48] <Cork> raj: yes
[01:49:00] <Cork> raj: styles should be in your css file
[01:49:26] <Cork> so when animations are done they should be reset to what the css gives
[01:49:26] <luky_vj> But make your tests with <style></style> directly on your html page,
[01:49:30] <luky_vj> time saver
[01:50:11] <luky_vj> raj: so ?
[01:51:06] <Cork> depends, if file structure is sane modifying the css file shouldn't be harder
[01:51:10] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Can I PM quickly please? Have a different q but bit lengthly
[01:51:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ok
[01:51:41] <luky_vj> Sure, but for dev tests, you should dev in the same document
[01:51:59] <Cork> for dev tests you should test in a separate structure
[01:55:00] <raj> apparently I made a mistake here
[01:55:01] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/PyXun/
[01:55:15] <raj> oh no, that's it
[01:55:40] <raj> notice how it doesn't hide when you click the other link
[01:55:54] <raj> it's supposed to because `.active` has been removed
[01:56:12] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: opps toggled the wrong flag, you have to try again
[01:56:37] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  it's ok I sorted it now, see PM
[02:00:08] <jessica> i want to get all the data in my table, where i can add new row, delete a row, update existing...and i want to do this using restful,json something
[02:00:23] <jessica> can any1 guide me the best way to achieve it ?  any example ?
[02:00:50] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/PyXun/5/
[02:02:53] <raj> its supposed to remove the other thing though
[02:02:56] <raj> only 1 should be displayed
[02:03:04] <raj> it's okay, your hide() idea worked perfectly
[02:03:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/PyXun/6/
[02:04:00] <raj> thank you sir :)
[02:06:45] <ItsJustMe> a girl o:
[02:06:52] * ItsJustMe is confused :D
[02:07:27] <Borre> How can I get the ISO time of the current time in JS/jQuery?
[02:07:51] <kyrix> any ideas on how to use fontawesome with raty? i've only found accounts it works, but I can't think of a way
[02:08:07] <lobbin> If I'd like a custom look on JQM checkboxes, what is the way to move forward? Custom plugin?
[02:08:39] <Borre> So I can hide hidden events in my list like if (currentISO > "2012-06-30T05:00:00+02:00") { return false; }
[02:09:36] <jessica> raj , can you suggest me what should i use ??
[02:09:46] <jessica> i want to get all the data in my table, where i can add new row, delete a row, update existing...and i want to do this using restful,json something
[02:10:26] <jessica> Borre, can you guide me the best way to ahieve this ?
[02:16:03] <pneftali> hi guys
[02:19:17] <Douglish> jessica: Simply create a view for each action, such as /object/add (for creating, should use POST method),  /object/delete/id (Deletes object identified by id), /object/edit/id (Should send data using POST and id is id of edited object), /object/id (Simple get to retrieve data). You can use simplejson for serialization (http://hdknr.github.com/docs/django/django.utils.simplejson.html)
[02:21:13] <jessica> Douglish, i am just a beginner, i wish some easy method if in there...or is there a tutorial to learn how to create a view for each action
[02:26:47] <Douglish> jessica: I would suggest you to go throught this django tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/
[02:26:56] <jessica> kk

[02:28:31] <Douglish> jessica: Or check out this great screencast http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/resources/
[02:29:23] <jessica> that link was saying python, but i dont use phthon
[02:29:28] <fRAiLtY-> Tried this too: http://pastie.org/5441748
[02:29:33] <fRAiLtY-> But nothing returned onclick
[02:29:42] <jessica> django is what ?
[02:30:28] <Douglish> jessica: django is a python web framework
[02:30:43] <jessica> i use js,jquery,php
[02:31:56] <Douglish> jessica: Then you should use some php framework. For example nette or something. I don't use PHP, so I don't know which one is the most suitable for you.
[02:32:07] <jessica> kk
[02:32:31] <Douglish> jessica: http://nette.org Maybe you can give it a try.
[02:32:35] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone ^^ ?
[02:32:46] <jessica> kk
[02:34:53] <Douglish> fRAiLtY-: You should try the jquery-related question on #jquery channel. Git greater chances to get answer I guess.
[02:35:06] <fRAiLtY-> I'm in jquery?
[02:36:28] <Asone> stupid question : does $('a:visited') target should work ?
[02:36:34] <Douglish> fRAiLtY-: Sorry, my bad, I thought my on different channel.
[02:43:11] <lobbin> Any freelancing JQM developer/designer here?
[02:43:35] <xec_> Asone: probably not https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector
[02:46:58] <Asone> :(
[02:47:08] <Asone> thanks xec_
[02:52:31] <MagePsycho> how to close fancybox once the form is submitted?
[02:58:02] <Trisox> MagePsycho: $.fancybox.close(); ?
[02:58:12] <MagePsycho> not working exactly
[02:58:22] <Trisox> hmm
[02:58:23] <MagePsycho> i am opening a login form in iframe
[02:58:31] <MagePsycho> and when try to submit the form
[02:58:31] <Trisox> frame
[02:58:46] <Trisox> 1 sec
[02:58:50] <MagePsycho> parent.jQuery.fancybox.close();
[02:58:52] <MagePsycho> using this
[03:01:07] <Trisox> parent.$.fn.fancybox.close();
[03:01:17] <Trisox> ah oke
[03:02:15] <MagePsycho> Trisox: let me try
[03:02:37] <Trisox> you only need to close it?
[03:02:43] <Trisox> or refresh also
[03:03:52] <Trisox> <a href="/yourparentpage" target="_parent">close</a>
[03:06:38] <MagePsycho> not working
[03:13:34] <ItsJustMe> MagePsycho: Maybe just hide it?
[03:13:48] <ItsJustMe> I use framewarp and just need to ..
[03:14:33] <MagePsycho> ItsJustMe: http://jquer.in/helpful-jquery-plugins-for-html5-websites/framewarp/
[03:14:35] <MagePsycho> ?
[03:15:20] <ItsJustMe> right ;) http://tutorialzine.com/2012/07/framewarp-jquery-plugin/
[03:16:48] <MagePsycho> ItsJustMe: seems therre is no close button like fancybox
[03:17:09] <MagePsycho> fancybox2 looks koolbut didn't figure out how to close fancybox once the form is submitted
[03:18:53] <khaan> guys sorry for the extreme n00b question, but can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/6ETSZ/
[03:19:30] <GoSox> I'm getting a "Can't find variable: $" error in my javascript file, at the last line of my jQuery container $(function() { code; });
[03:19:40] <GoSox> the line with the " }); "
[03:22:22] <GoSox> i don't need to pastebin it, it's not that big, you can just look at it directly. Line 71 throws the error
[03:22:23] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/js/main.js
[03:22:38] <ItsJustMe> khaan what do you want to do?
[03:22:59] <khaan> itsJustMe: just to toggle the value of the margin into that ID
[03:24:01] <ItsJustMe> khaan so that it moves onclick?
[03:24:24] <khaan> yes, when i click on the button with id #homeButton the other #wrapper div moves along
[03:24:41] <khaan> should be elementary or so
[03:26:45] <GoSox> solved my own problem :D
[03:27:14] <GoSox> but this one is baffling me. I load some new content from the server into a div. That new content has tags with some IDs. I want to add some classes to some of those new IDs but I can't seem to
[03:28:19] <dogmatic69> GoSox: do it before inserting in the page maybe?
[03:28:29] <GoSox> you mean server side?
[03:28:45] <dogmatic69> $(your_html).addClass(...);
[03:28:47] <ItsJustMe> khaan: do you need to move it back?
[03:28:50] <ItsJustMe> or only forward?
[03:28:59] <khaan> back and forward
[03:29:03] <khaan> it's a toggle
[03:29:36] <GoSox> dogmatic69: i don't get hat you're suggesting
[03:36:00] <ItsJustMe> khaan: a bit quick'n'dirty, but works http://jsfiddle.net/J4emk/
[03:36:59] <khaan> trying, thank you
[03:37:00] <GoSox> I came up with this, but it doesn't seem to be working either: $("li").find("#r"+$.cookie('last-rest')).addClass("marked_li");
[03:37:20] <ItsJustMe> np :)
[03:37:55] <GoSox> maybe find is still not looking at 'newly' inserted items?
[03:39:22] <dogmatic69> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/fncXc/1/
[03:39:43] <dogmatic69> That adds some html and sets a class, maybe your selectors are not correct.
[03:43:06] <GoSox> dogmatic69: that's more or less what I have, except throw an ID on the <b> tag, and addClass by ID instead of by tag reference
[03:45:02] <dogmatic69> GoSox: still works http://jsfiddle.net/fncXc/2/
[03:45:36] <GoSox> also my data is loaded with a $.get from an external page, would that affect it?
[03:45:49] <dogmatic69> and if you want to use a var, http://jsfiddle.net/fncXc/3/
[03:46:19] <dogmatic69> .get still has success: function(data)...
[03:46:59] <dogmatic69> You should debug the data and make sure the id is even there. also debug the selectors you are making and check they are correct. eg: you could be doing #undefined
[03:47:18] <GoSox> i did both of that and everything looks good
[03:47:26] <GoSox> this is the meat of my code: http://jsfiddle.net/YCeKm/
[03:47:46] <GoSox> that restaurants.php file inserts the ID i'm trying to work with, i know this for sure
[03:47:53] <GoSox> and i get an ALERT with the proper selector
[03:47:58] <GoSox> but i get no class added
[03:48:08] <GoSox> and no errors in the inspector
[03:53:37] <GoSox> and my addClass line works if i hard code in some other random ID from my page. It just doesn't work on the IDs i insert from the $.get request
[03:54:32] <GoSox> i gotta go i guess ill try again later
[04:07:58] <tankblergh> Hi! I have a question about a line of code im trying to interpret here. It starts with "$.widget". Does anyone know what that is?
[04:10:53] <seutje> tankblergh: jQuery UI shizzle afaik
[04:11:19] <tankblergh> aha, good place to start, thanks
[04:12:41] <seutje> tankblergh: http://jqueryui.com/widget/
[04:31:23] <tankblergh> thanks!
[04:32:11] <Cork> ... ms, i love you guys...
[04:32:33] <Cork> ie10 removed support for filter: gray; but they didn't implement any other way to get the same effect...
[04:32:38] <Cork> lovely...
[04:34:10] <my_name> search google for "ie10 unnecessary 25 hour workarounds" there should be a list of hundreds of things to do
[04:35:14] <Cork> my_name: that search gives me nothing
[04:35:15] <ItsJustMe> I'm wondering why anyone is further using IE .. There are so much better ones ^^
[04:35:25] <ItsJustMe> Why are we trying to support it?
[04:35:31] <Cork> and the only workaround as of now is to embed the content in an inline svg tag
[04:35:55] <Cork> ItsJustMe: cause you should try to support all the major browsers if possible
[04:36:00] <Cork> at least the newer ones
[04:36:34] <ItsJustMe> yeah, but if nobody would further support that piece of **** it would not be a major one much longer ;D
[04:36:41] <ItsJustMe> and it would be that simple o.ô
[04:36:45] <Cork> and its quite annoying that i can solve it easily in firefox, chrome and safari ie5.5 > ie9 but not in ie10 :/
[04:37:20] <Cork> there i need to send all the data twice ones for the colored copy and ones for the grayscale version...
[04:37:59] <ItsJustMe> The only problem of no further support would be the companies where the administrators block everything else ^^
[04:38:37] <my_name> Cork sorry, that was a joke.. not really a good search..
[04:38:38] <Cork> ItsJustMe: well then 30%+ of the visitor uses the damn browser you don't really have a choice
[04:38:47] <Cork> then==when
[04:39:18] <Cork> oh well its there dataplans
[04:44:15] <lobbin> If I'd like a custom look on JQM checkboxes, what is the way to move forward? Custom plugin?
[04:44:33] <pbalduino> hi there. i have a question about event naming in jquery. i don't know if there's a standard about it.
[04:44:55] <Cork> lobbin: is jqm using the native look normally?
[04:45:51] <Cork> lobbin: if yes, you can use one of the css hacks that uses a checkbox and a label and images in the label based on the input:checked selector
[04:46:02] <lobbin> Cork: No, the checkbox is styled JQM-ish, but I want to style it differently from the normal JQM way
[04:46:04] <Cork> lobbin: its prob the cleanest and most stable way to do it
[04:46:21] <Cork> lobbin: then modify its css
[04:46:30] <Cork> that should be all you need
[04:46:42] <Cork> ?ask @ pbalduino
[04:46:46] <bot-t> pbalduino, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:47:07] <DukeDrake> if I add an element like $('#container').append('<div id="#newid">text</div>'); - will $('#newid').length be 0 or 1?
[04:47:32] <pbalduino> when I'm using a named function to handle an event, I use to name it as on[Identifier][Event]. what do you think about it? is this correct? for example: given an element with id #foo, the named function for the event would be onFooClick
[04:47:54] <Cork> DukeDrake: 1
[04:48:13] <pbalduino> so $("#foo").click(onFooClick);
[04:48:26] <lobbin> Cork: I don't think I can solve it just by modifing it's css
[04:48:34] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[04:48:57] <Cork> DukeDrake: or you can just do var newid = $('<div>text</div>');  $('#container').append(newid);
[04:49:44] <Cork> pbalduino: just pick a standard and stick with it
[04:50:00] <foobar321> Hi. I would like to download jqueryMobile 1.3 version. I know it's not released yet but I just need tables from there. Where can I find whole package for this ?
[04:50:02] <Cork> pbalduino: depending on who you do it you might not want to have it as named functions
[04:50:18] <DukeDrake> Cork: thanx
[04:50:33] <foobar321> Is this channel for jquerymobile as well ?
[04:51:04] <lobbin> A sidenote, I'm also looking for freelancers or consultants with experience in JQM. Is there a preferred list of partners or something like that?
[04:51:32] <foobar321> I cannot join #jquerymobile :/ Can someone invite me please? Or answer my question where to find files for unreleased 1.3 version ?
[04:52:37] <Cork> foobar321: i expect that you should get the upcomming ine here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[04:52:56] <pbalduino> Cork: it's just an exceptional case when it's better to increase legibility. Thank you
[04:52:58] <foobar321> Cork: but where to get version 1.3 ?
[04:53:18] <Cork> foobar321: that link points to git master
[04:53:30] <Cork> its as close to 1.3 as you can get
[04:53:42] <Cork> its the working state or right now
[04:56:00] <DukeDrake> Cork: I just checked ... my version returns .length = 0 :(
[04:56:32] <Cork> DukeDrake: and $('#container').length ?
[04:58:05] <DukeDrake> hm
[04:58:15] <DukeDrake> I should probably learn how to use the console ...
[04:58:25] <Cork> prob
[04:58:28] <theCole> DukeDrake: there is not much to learn
[04:58:31] <theCole> it is super easy
[04:58:36] <theCole> console.log
[04:58:39] <theCole> console.warn
[04:58:45] <DukeDrake> yeah
[04:58:47] <theCole> learn how to use the debugger
[04:59:12] <DukeDrake> I mean the ">>>" thing in firebug .. do I need to use "console.log()" there, too?
[04:59:22] <theCole> http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[04:59:37] <theCole> nah, use chromes dev tools
[04:59:41] <theCole> way better
[05:00:32] <DukeDrake> maybe. But I need to solve this in FF now ^^
[05:01:36] <DukeDrake> Cork: $('#container').length is "1", of course ...
[05:04:25] <ravigehlot> Guys, I am trying to use AJAX to call an action page without leaving the current page then do what it needs to do and return a message. Any quick code available to do this?
[05:06:25] <DukeDrake> ravigehlot: $.post("[address of your server or script], yourvar=yourvalue, function(data) {alert(data); }, "text" }
[05:07:03] <theCole> DukeDrake: what exactly is your problem?
[05:08:55] <DukeDrake> I think I solved it by now
[05:09:02] <DukeDrake> Cork gave the right hint
[05:10:03] <Cork> DukeDrake: another thing to check is that you don't have multiple instances with the same id
[05:10:13] <Cork> that could cause problems like that
[05:10:24] <DukeDrake> or not
[05:10:48] <DukeDrake> my version as well as Cork's bot work in the console XD
[05:10:56] <DukeDrake> *both
[05:11:08] <Cork> DukeDrake: you're waiting for dom ready?
[05:12:03] <DukeDrake> sure
[05:12:26] <DukeDrake> Cork: The DOM change gets applied as a callback from a $.post
[05:13:01] <Cork> and $('[id="container"]').length $('[id="newid"]').length ?
[05:14:42] <DukeDrake> meh
[05:15:04] <Cork> ?
[05:15:16] <DukeDrake> (still doesn't work)
[05:15:36] <Cork> can't come up with any more tips without seeing the code
[05:16:25] <DukeDrake> $('[id="container"]').length = 1, $('[id="newid"]').length = 0
[05:16:45] <DukeDrake> If I try the code in the console, it works XD
[05:17:02] <Cork> so the new html was never appended
[05:17:15] <Cork> check so it validates
[05:17:27] <Cork> and are you sure the callback from post is called?
[05:17:53] <theCole> can you share your code?
[05:18:15] <DukeDrake> ok, hang on
[05:18:28] <DukeDrake> maybe there's an error in the html
[05:23:15] <DukeDrake> console doesn't like linebreaks in html-code??
[05:26:01] <DukeDrake> If there's a linebreak in the html code, console will complain about an "unterminated string literal"
[05:26:06] <DukeDrake> :/
[05:27:41] <seutje> DukeDrake: works fine for me
[05:38:41] <DukeDrake> yupp
[05:39:13] <DukeDrake> var somestring = 'string with
[05:39:27] <DukeDrake> line break';  ... seems to be illegal?
[05:41:06] <djsounds02> if I want to replace certain words in my content with another word what do I use?
[05:41:40] <zhulikas> a regular expression?
[05:41:56] <djsounds02> is that to me?
[05:42:04] <zhulikas> yes
[05:42:13] <djsounds02> no idea what you mean then in that case
[05:42:24] <zhulikas> then don't use it
[05:42:24] <zhulikas> :D
[05:42:34] <_MagePsycho> has anyone used tinybox for formpopup?
[05:42:38] <djsounds02> huh?
[05:42:46] <zhulikas> it's complicated
[05:42:53] <djsounds02> ok
[05:42:59] <djsounds02> so how would I do it?
[05:43:06] <djsounds02> is it .text?
[05:47:10] <DukeDrake> djsounds02: it's not complicated. Use yourstring.replace
[05:47:35] <DukeDrake> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp
[05:49:11] <DukeDrake> Cork: apparently it really is the linebreak which is messing everything up XD
[05:50:12] <theCole> DukeDrake: ya that is bad form
[05:50:18] <theCole> you can add a / at the end of the line
[05:50:28] <theCole> and that will let you do multi line string declarationg
[05:51:28] <DukeDrake> theCole: ah
[05:52:12] <DukeDrake> theCole: but ... is it possible to understand, why it is bad form?
[05:53:03] <djsounds02> DukeDrake Thanks
[05:53:26] <theCole> DukeDrake: bad form because it is illegal javascript
[05:53:27] <theCole> lol
[05:56:17] <DukeDrake> theCole: that doesn't explain anything lol
[05:56:36] <DukeDrake> why is a linebreak in a string illegal?
[05:57:28] <selectable> exit
[05:57:35] <selectable> i mean
[06:01:59] <niyazpk> it was one of the language decisions which got stuck..
[06:04:12] <mazzachre> Did jsfiddle just die?
[06:04:44] <halcyon1234> @mazzachre: I can't access jsfiddle either.
[06:05:08] <veQue> ok is using jquery as a style sheet bad for performance?
[06:05:25] <veQue> just having a lot of .css calls
[06:05:35] <veQue> or no worse than actual css?
[06:06:25] <mazzachre> veQue: That should be fairly easy to test...
[06:07:11] <veQue> ....
[06:07:15] <mazzachre> It works... but it have horrendously slow access times... minutes!
[06:07:18] <veQue> not a simple  yes or no?
[06:07:27] <veQue> ohhh
[06:07:30] <mazzachre> veQue: I have no idea...
[06:07:43] <mazzachre> jsfiddle that is...
[06:07:47] <veQue> so use .css calls only when making something dynamic?
[06:08:20] <mazzachre> veQue: No idea... You could setup a test, there is somewhere to do that...
[06:08:39] <veQue> well i was looking for a faster answer
[06:09:07] <veQue> at this point in the project i can go either way because if it is slower it wont be too noticable
[06:09:20] <veQue> but in future projects it would be good to know
[06:09:38] <RA3OR> if its slow, some links might be broken
[06:09:43] <niyazpk> ideally use jquery to set/remove classes and then style in your css using the classes
[06:10:35] <veQue> oh i see
[06:10:58] <veQue> so basically. dont try to avoid having a style.css file
[06:11:05] <veQue> lol
[06:11:09] <veQue> thanks
[06:13:01] <niyazpk> yeah styles belong in css files (or better sass files: http://sass-lang.com/ )
[06:21:08] <mazzachre> niyazpk: Or in the system I am hired to work on... in style="" tags dotted randomly around the entire code... /cry
[06:22:06] <Teduardo> what is the best way to say if isset(div#sta) { //do stuff } else { //do other stuff } in jquery?
[06:23:24] <mazzachre> what do you mean by isset?
[06:23:29] <veQue> mazzachre: lol
[06:23:30] <Teduardo> if it exists
[06:23:59] <veQue> mazzachre: well thanks to that comment i'll casually remove my style tag
[06:24:02] <mazzachre> Well, $('#sta').length will tell you if something is found or not
[06:24:22] <mazzachre> veQue: You just saved a kitteh :)
[06:24:25] <Teduardo> i was hoping i could use like if (document.getElementById(sta)) { }
[06:25:15] <mazzachre> Teduardo: Dunno about that... but if($('#sta').length) {} will do the job... and it won't throw any exceptions
[06:28:58] <Borre> mmm, why is "$('table#events td').not('.inactive').click( function() {" not workig? :/
[06:29:26] <seutje> ?dw
[06:29:36] <bot-t> seutje, Don't convert $(undefined) to $(document), use arguments.length ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3695
[06:29:41] <seutje> what the poop?
[06:29:58] <Teduardo> mazzachre: is there a way to say if ( ($('#sta').length) && ($('#sta').html() == "OH") ) { //something }
[06:30:02] <seutje> Borre: prolly cause that collection is empty when it's executed
[06:34:07] <Teduardo> is jsfiddle.net screwy for anyone else?
[06:34:58] <brad> http://isup.me/jsfiddle.net
[06:35:07] <Teduardo> ah, it's up but when I click run it hangs
[06:35:12] <neys> Hey guys. I'm using this code: http://jsfiddle.net/686Xk/1/ to load content when a button is pressed. I was just wondering if there wasn't a way to sort of "minimize" the code, so I don't have to repeat it for each new button I need to load stuff
[06:35:26] <brad> doesn't work for me Teduardo
[06:35:40] <Borre> same here
[06:35:56] <dogmatic69> not working for me either.
[06:36:02] <Teduardo> neys: you could set all of them in a class and then operate on the class
[06:36:21] <neys> Teduardo: how= :S
[06:37:18] <Saaether> neys you only need 1 document ready wrapper
[06:37:36] <neys> okay
[06:39:12] <neys> Saaether: like this?: http://jsfiddle.net/686Xk/2/
[06:40:15] <veQue> $('.myTextOut').val(C.toString()) ; ..... ok i'm trying to condense my code.. i have n text inputs  all class="myTextOut" .. How can i call that val(C.toString) method on all of them except 'this' ?
[06:40:25] <Saaether> id tell you if jsfiddle moved abit faster =/
[06:40:44] <Saaether> neys http://jsfiddle.net/686Xk/4/ heres what i did quickly
[06:41:14] <neys> sweet, thanks :)
[06:41:54] <neys> Saaether: Dont I need a document ready around it all ?
[06:42:14] <Saaether> thats what the first line does
[06:42:48] <Saaether> $(function() {}); is the shortform for document ready
[06:42:52] <neys> is $ = a document ready?
[06:42:54] <neys> ah, okay
[06:42:56] <neys> didnt know
[06:44:24] <neys> thanks a lot, Saaether
[06:44:25] <Siver> Hi, silly question ... is there some sort of jquery plugin that provides a fallback for media queries ... so that ie7 users can view the website as intended
[06:44:33] <Saaether> np
[06:45:56] <neys> Saaether: It's saying there's an unexpected token at the last line 'ILLEGAL'
[06:46:29] <Saaether> o.O
[06:46:32] <neys> oh wait, isn't that a bug with pasting from jsfiddle?
[06:46:48] <Saaether> unless i typo'd something it should be ok
[06:46:49] <neys> like an 'invisible' symbol. Think I've had that before
[06:49:45] <neys> what's the difference between using $ and jQuery?
[06:49:56] <Saaether> its just a shortform
[06:50:18] <Saaether> who wants to type out jQuery all the time? heh
[06:50:18] <neys> oki
[06:50:23] <neys> :)
[06:51:40] <neys> Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ this is what jsfiddle leaves at the end of a document when I copy paste from it. Weird
[06:51:51] <Saaether> weird
[06:51:54] <Saaether> ive never seen that
[06:52:13] <osman> deneme
[06:52:18] <osman> merhaba
[06:52:43] <osman> haha
[06:56:28] <aqeel> hi room
[06:57:26] <aqeel> .text(menu+" menu - Locked").addClass("red").removeClass("green");------------------------------->.text(menu+" menu - Locked").toggleClass("red green");...is not working
[06:59:36] <Trisox> aqeel
[06:59:42] <aqeel> yes
[06:59:43] <Trisox> ).toggleClass("red ,green");
[07:00:35] <Trisox> migth work
[07:01:03] <aqeel> trying
[07:01:07] <aqeel> thanks
[07:01:17] <Trisox> does it work?
[07:01:34] <aqeel> nope
[07:01:43] <Trisox> hhh
[07:01:44] <Saaether> One or more class names (separated by spaces) to be toggled for each element in the matched set.
[07:01:44] <aqeel> i wonder why?
[07:01:45] <Trisox> :)
[07:01:48] <Trisox> no i dont
[07:01:51] <Trisox> hehe
[07:01:53] <Saaether> spaces not comma's
[07:02:13] <Trisox> it adds red green
[07:02:20] <Trisox> and removes it
[07:02:25] <aqeel> spaces also not working
[07:02:53] <Trisox> <div class="red green">   .. <div class="">
[07:02:56] <Trisox> thats the toggle
[07:03:05] <Trisox> not between red and green
[07:03:39] <aqeel> i want between red and green
[07:03:46] <Saaether> toggleClass adds or removes a class depending on if the element has that class or not, it doesnt replace one class with another. if thats what you are trying to do
[07:03:53] <aqeel> .text(menu+" menu - Locked").addClass("red").removeClass("green");
[07:04:03] <aqeel> i want to replace add and remove with toggle
[07:05:34] <Leentje> use 2 toggles then
[07:05:46] <Leentje> and make sure only 1 is on at the moment of loading
[07:07:08] <aqeel> but can't i use toggleClass([switch])
[07:07:17] <Saaether> 1 toggle is fine for both classes as long as the element only has 1 of the classes
[07:07:30] <aqeel> yes it has only one class,
[07:07:40] <aqeel> but togles on situtation
[07:10:56] <Saaether> heres a quick example of it working
[07:10:56] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/nJPBh/
[07:15:51] <aqeel> well it is not working .....might i did not specifically specify its initial state, add and remove will force as code is passed through but for toggle, i must need something to toggle against...
[07:17:56] <aqeel> Saaether: thanks for your code....according to it, i do not have specify my initial state and is only added at that moment....where addClass() comes in...
[07:18:23] <aqeel> so for my toggle i guess need to have a condition..
[07:19:13] <aqeel> so i cannot simply change it to toggleClass() like that...
[07:19:33] <wturrell> Does anyone know how the 'mouse target' (thats not the proper name - I mean the bit where you get the down arrow) is specified in jQueryUI resizable?  If I apply it to an element, changing the padding, margin and border doesn't seem to make any difference.  I want to increase the size of the area where you can activate it.
[07:21:08] <xec> good afternoon everybody!
[07:21:20] <BillCriswell> Ay yoooo
[07:21:33] <abletony84> hey xec!
[07:21:39] <aqeel> so is my add remove ok or do i chnage it to toggleclass....what are your opinions
[07:21:42] <abletony84> whoyoooooooh
[07:22:04] <aqeel> goodevening..
[07:22:12] <abletony84> (as they say near the equator)
[07:23:51] <wturrell> re: above - it looks like it's in the CSS - .ui-resizable-* for each 'handle' and hardcoded based on the theme
[07:24:47] <BillCriswell> wturrell: That's what I was just looking at. I think you'd have to make that taller and wider and position the background image at the bottom right.
[07:24:49] <computer2000> how do i select the element right before the one which is currently selected? i have 10 li elements, currently the 8th is selected and i need to select the one before it, the 7th
[07:24:58] <computer2000> without eq()
[07:26:21] <kyrix> while trying to use bootstrap wizard: https://github.com/gilluminate/Bootstrap-Wizard, i don't find the obj where I have to apply the next or play methods. its not element.bwizard.count, and not jQuery.boostrap.bwizard, and I don't find anything else
[07:27:09] <BillCriswell> computer2000: .prev()
[07:27:20] <computer2000> BillCriswell: thx man
[07:27:24] <BillCriswell> $('li.selected').prev() I guess, depending on your css.
[07:27:26] <BillCriswell> Sure thing!
[07:28:01] <BillCriswell> Well... HTML... You get it thoguh
[07:29:00] <Ninjabear> My site seems totally broken but I can't figure it out. It's saying there are errors in jquery, cufon, easing plugin, everything and all the same error.
[07:29:36] <Ninjabear> http://testseedetail.seedetail.co.uk/  <--If you could help I would appreciate it. Look in Firefox error console
[07:31:11] <BillCriswell> Ninjabear: Is the line before the /*/23b416*/ supposed to be there in http://testseedetail.seedetail.co.uk/js/cufon.js ?
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> just seems out of place.
[07:32:38] <BillCriswell> Ninjabear: That appears to be in all your scripts... Did you run any kind of project wide replacement?
[07:32:45] <Ninjabear> BillCriswell: See I don't know what that number is but I think we got hacked at some point.
[07:33:05] <Ninjabear> I'll download cufon again, thanks.
[07:33:57] <BillCriswell> Ninjabear: Good plan! That in consistent across the 3 scripts.
[07:35:22] <dmcdaniel12> Hello folks. Got an issue with .show and .hide in chrome. Any ideas if there are conflicts with Chrome that I should be aware of?
[07:36:58] <BillCriswell> dmcdaniel12: Your best bet is to just put some code somewhere in a situation like this.
[07:37:17] <dmcdaniel12> BillCriswell - Here is what I am using: works fine on FF, not in Chrome: http://pastebin.com/qjdH1qJD
[07:39:01] <thomas____> Hi guys, after 8 hours of trying all types of things, i'm finally at my end. Could someone help me out a couple of minutes? I don't want anyone to write my code, I just need help finding an error. If anyone has a few minutes for a 1on1 conversation, hook me up!
[07:39:39] <brad> just ask your question
[07:39:49] <thomas____> ok
[07:41:49] <thomas____> I use a script called superbgimage, a derivate of the widely used supersized plugin to display an image almost fullscreen (within a certain container), in chrome, FF and so on things are working perfectly, but in any IE-version the first image gets extremely stretched. What bothers me about it, that its a javscript and not a css-thing. The page I am talking about is this one: http://werbeagenten.com/design/branding/
[07:44:43] <GoSox> so how can I select an ID after i've inserted it into my document via .html()? simply doing a regular $("#id") doesn't work on dynamically created stuff
[07:45:22] <warrenparsons> GoSox: $('#wrapper').on('click', '#id', function(){â€¦});
[07:45:26] <jacta> Is it possible to get height in px of first two line text? http://jsfiddle.net/BaMF8/
[07:45:45] <GoSox> warrenparsons: i don't want to act on a click, i want to addClass() to my element :)
[07:45:51] <GoSox> its not classy
[07:46:27] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Why not add the class at the same point you insert the element into the DOM?
[07:46:36] <BillCriswell> dmcdaniel12: Hmmm... it appears it needs a duration, but the docs say otherwise.
[07:47:06] <GoSox> warrenparsons: i'm inserting a list of a whole lot of elements all at once
[07:47:14] <dmcdaniel12> BillCriswell - That is strange. I'm calling the loadSpinner when the ajax starts, and unloadSpinner when ajax stops. Works fine on FF. Okay, I will look into the docs some more. Thanks
[07:47:19] <GoSox> and I have the ID number of the one I want to add a class to
[07:47:34] <warrenparsons> GoSox: A simple $('#id').addClass() should work if you run it after the insertion.
[07:48:00] <GoSox> i do and it doesnt
[07:48:23] <GoSox> i verified the selector string is right
[07:48:30] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Can you create a jsfiddle? This should be a pretty cut and dried operation to perform.
[07:48:41] <GoSox> and if i used a different selector, IT does get the class
[07:49:28] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Dumb question, but you're not reusing the same ID multiple times, are you?
[07:49:34] <GoSox> nope
[07:49:35] <warrenparsons> k
[07:49:37] <GoSox> they are prefixed
[07:49:45] <GoSox> "r100", "r101" etc
[07:49:46] <BillCriswell> dmcdaniel12: Yeah that's interesting.
[07:51:20] <BillCriswell> dmcdaniel12: I think I was just doing something wrong. This appears to work totally fine: http://jsfiddle.net/LewqN/
[07:51:31] <GoSox> warrenparsons: this is going to be hard to jsfiddle as it uses cookies and loading content from external pages
[07:51:49] <GoSox> you can't use $.get() to load data from a different domain, can you?
[07:51:58] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Not usually.
[07:52:02] <GoSox> ok well
[07:52:11] <dmcdaniel12> BillCriswell - thanks. I will take a look at that and see if I can get it to work on my side.
[07:52:17] <GoSox> let me paste up my code anyway, it won't be functional but you'll get it, it's pretty simple
[07:52:27] <warrenparsons> GoSox: That'll work.
[07:52:46] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net
[07:52:50] <GoSox> so with that code
[07:53:01] <GoSox> i get an alert with the correct ID
[07:53:12] <warrenparsons> GoSox: That URL is missing something :)
[07:53:15] <jacta> can anyone help me with my question?
[07:53:23] <GoSox> huh that's wierd
[07:53:28] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/UUvbU/
[07:53:29] <BillCriswell> dmcdaniel12: I figure out why my first thing "wasn't working" haha. I'm a dumb ass.
[07:53:54] <GoSox> so I get an alert with the right ID
[07:54:11] <GoSox> i can view the document with the inspector and see the ID get inserted with the .html() call
[07:54:17] <GoSox> but the ID does not get the class added
[07:54:27] <warrenparsons> GoSox: looking
[07:54:37] <thomas____> jacta: do you just need the height of .Caption?
[07:54:41] <GoSox> i can send you to the live document too if you want
[07:55:28] <jacta> thomas____, only first two lines inside caption - could be three lines in total, but need to limit to two
[07:55:40] <warrenparsons> GoSox: First off you could probably build that selector inline if you didn't need it elsewhere. $('#r' + $.cookie('last-rest'));
[07:55:56] <GoSox> warrenparsons: yeah thats how i originally had it
[07:56:02] <thomas____> jacta: can you wrap the first two lines in an additional element?
[07:56:02] <GoSox> but with the alert and all
[07:56:16] <jacta> thomas____, no :/
[07:56:33] <warrenparsons> GoSox: And the alert just returns your string, right? Not a jQuery object.
[07:57:02] <GoSox> correct, it says "#r731" without quotes
[07:57:05] <warrenparsons> k
[07:57:22] <thomas____> jacta: just giving some input: you could calculate it with font-size and line-height values
[07:57:52] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Personally I wouldn't prefix that var with a $, as that indicates a jQuery object is in the var according to typical conventions.
[07:57:55] <GoSox> warrenparsons: could it just be a time thing? like maybe the browser is getting to the addClass before the .html() is done? should i add it as an inline callback function?
[07:57:57] <jacta> thomas____, problem is, that right now on some browsers it not all the same, that way would maybe do it
[07:58:30] <warrenparsons> GoSox: That could be it. If it's firing before the $.get is finished, that would explain the problem.
[07:58:31] <GoSox> removed the $, no effect
[07:58:34] <thomas____> jacta: Ah, and I assume you want to calculate difference by getting the height of the two lines, right?
[07:58:49] <warrenparsons> GoSox: No, it wouldn't have a code effect. Just makes it easier to read.
[07:59:19] <GoSox> i'm from php land, if a variable doesn't start with a $, it's not a variable, to my brain
[07:59:27] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Gotcha.
[07:59:41] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Just keep it in mind for future reference, as it's very common in jQuery land.
[07:59:42] <jacta> I want to set height of element .Caption so only two lines is showed, even if it fills for 4 :p
[08:00:08] <GoSox> warrenparsons: so can you put a callback function in .html( ) ?
[08:00:35] <thomas____> jacta: the proper way of doing this is truncating string serverside, but thats probably not applicable?
[08:00:56] <warrenparsons> GoSox: I would probably put it right after the .html command. I don't think .html() accepts a callback directly. Code order should do the job, though.
[08:01:14] <GoSox> but isn't the code already in the right order?
[08:01:27] <jacta> thomas____, text is from another system, so its not possible to do
[08:01:32] <GoSox> oh you mean inside GET's callback?
[08:01:34] <warrenparsons> GoSox: It is, but that piece isn't contained in $.get's callback.
[08:01:42] <warrenparsons> GoSox: There you go.
[08:01:47] <GoSox> ok let me try that
[08:02:39] <thomas____> jacta: you could truncate also on the client side, like: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1199352/smart-way-to-shorten-long-strings-with-javascript
[08:03:24] <GoSox> warrenparsons++
[08:03:31] <warrenparsons> That worked?
[08:03:37] <GoSox> yup
[08:03:42] <warrenparsons> Great
[08:03:51] <GoSox> now my selector goes back inline, bye bye alert
[08:03:53] <GoSox> aaaannddddd
[08:04:32] <GoSox> yup
[08:04:34] <GoSox> works great!
[08:04:35] <GoSox> thanks
[08:04:38] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Also, if you're not already, I'd strongly suggest using console.log() in place of alert(). It's much less painful to use, especially where you're running it multiple times.
[08:05:07] <GoSox> meh. safari 6's dev tools are such a pain compared to the old ones
[08:05:16] <GoSox> a little alert just to see a string, ain't so bad
[08:05:21] <warrenparsons> *cough* Chrome.
[08:05:34] <GoSox> yeah i do switch to chrome sometimes when i'm doing dev work
[08:05:42] <GoSox> but for general use, safari is much nicer
[08:05:49] <GoSox> and so i always end up back in safari
[08:06:08] <warrenparsons> Heh, I always feel way too limited in Safari. I like my plugins.
[08:06:20] <GoSox> well there you go, i do not like plugins
[08:06:28] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: inside your js file (jquery.superbgimage.js) you have on line 22 a }; thats invalid
[08:06:42] <GoSox> except click2flash, i wish there was still a good click2flash available for safari, like the old plugin that was great, not like the new extension that suckss
[08:06:50] <thomas____> jacta: what about a css-only solution with a fixed height and text-overflow: ellipsis;
[08:07:20] <GoSox> warrenparsons: so how often do you use cookies on a jQuery heavy website?
[08:07:26] <jacta> thomas____, fixed height shows different on different machines with different browsers :\
[08:07:37] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: uh,, i dont know the problem yet, but i am looking.. but you have error
[08:07:44] <warrenparsons> GoSox: As often as necessary. It really depends.
[08:07:53] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: thanks so much for taking time!
[08:08:00] <warrenparsons> GoSox: The jquery.cookie plugin makes it very easy.
[08:08:20] <thomas____> jacta: but the px difference between browsers is never full text-line, right?
[08:08:25] <GoSox> i've rarely used them at all over the past 10 years, but suddenly on this fairly fancy jquery heavy website, i've been using them left and right. I had to put the in a spreadsheet so i can keep track of them
[08:08:33] <GoSox> yup i use the jquery plugin
[08:08:38] <jacta> thomas____, should be right yep
[08:08:40] <GoSox> javascript's native cookie handling is so terrible
[08:08:44] <GoSox> php's is so easy
[08:10:03] <warrenparsons> GoSox: If I'm just passing state from one page to another, I usually prefer querystring vars. If I had to guess at an average, I probably create 1 to 3 cookies myself on the front end on a given site.
[08:10:08] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: hmm in that file line 22 is still in the comment block? dont get it
[08:10:18] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: actually, i copied wrong. it is ok
[08:10:58] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: ah, ok. the fact that just IE gets it wrong makes me stodder. at least JS (i thought) is crossbrowser the same
[08:11:13] <GoSox> on this website, i do lots of dynamic content where you navigte through columns, kind of like the column view in teh Finder. So I use cookies to store the last thing you loaded, so when the page is reload (ie back button), it can restore the state, since the URLs don't give any information
[08:11:28] <GoSox> i also tried implementing the new history stuff but that did not work out at all
[08:11:30] <warrenparsons> GoSox: Fair enough.
[08:11:38] <GoSox> it's pretty cool though
[08:11:51] <GoSox> i'm up to 13 so far on this site
[08:12:01] <GoSox> most of them only live for an hour
[08:12:22] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: JS is the reason of browser wars, jQuery is so popular because is handles these issues
[08:13:34] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: a pity! as far as my research goes: imgs get a weird 5-digit top value from the script
[08:14:09] <xrmx> hello, i can't figure how to do a POST request with basic auth, i get 401, i can't figure out how to add the proper Authorization: Basic header, any hint? http://pastebin.com/kGTvsApc
[08:14:31] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: but it's crazy because in the comment section of the plugin not a single comment stated wierd IE-behaviour. and there are more than 150 comments
[08:14:41] <jacta> thomas____, so you would do?
[08:15:04] <computer2000> pls help - i have a relatively positioned container with absolutely positioned images in it overlapping each other (slideshow), now the problem is, all content which follows after the relative position container gets lifted to the top, under the container... how can i avoid that?
[08:15:28] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: jsut throwing this out there, have you tried a diffirent image to start with?
[08:16:04] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: actually every subpage (click the navigation to the left) has its own images, uploaded through a cms
[08:16:12] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: so yeah
[08:16:37] <jrockjiggz> xrmx: req.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "'Basic \'Zm9vOmJhcg=='"); //or something..
[08:16:46] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: another piece of information: on the front page (http://werbeagenten.com/) there is the same script, but working even in IE
[08:17:06] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: so I suppose its about the inline usage (not fullscreen)
[08:17:22] <thomas____> jacta: I think the css solution is the easiest and most elegant
[08:18:12] <jacta> thomas____, but aint that pr line?
[08:18:44] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: its hard to test without a case.. i would look at Math.round (lines 373) and see if it is rounding properly.. i'm pretty sure it is newheight (line 383) that is coming out wrong
[08:19:17] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: ok, good one - will test a bit with the rounding scenarios
[08:19:26] <thomas____> jrockjiggz:  thanks so far for your time!
[08:19:37] <jrockjiggz> np
[08:24:02] <xrmx> jrockjiggz, nope, even with that quotes i see an OPTIONS request sent without the Authorization header
[08:24:37] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: ah, I got a good one: in jQuery.fn.superbgCalcSize (352) i've now put in a console.log(imgh); and suddenly I get weird numbers in IE! first a null, then the correct 1333 and suddenly 19515 which is way too much
[08:24:57] <jrockjiggz> IE doesnt have console.log unfortunately
[08:25:26] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: why does it print stuff in the console then lol
[08:25:39] <jrockjiggz> lol maybe newer ones
[08:25:54] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: haha got ie9 running
[08:27:37] <aqeel> press f12
[08:29:18] <jrockjiggz2> thomas____: browserheight = $('#' + options.id).height(); //line 363
[08:30:35] <thomas____> jrockjiggz2: but the wrong numbers come before this line, looks like they already get faulty passed to the function
[08:31:38] <jrockjiggz2> what is $('#' + options.id).height(
[08:32:18] <thomas____> jrockjiggz2: options.id is the specified element in which the imgs get placed
[08:32:32] <wildman> jrockjiggz: $('#' + options.id) will select the element with id = options.id
[08:32:39] <jrockjiggz> what is $('#' + options.id).height();  -- log that
[08:32:40] <GoSox> can you do a POST with $.get? or is there a $.post?
[08:32:55] <thomas____> jrockjiggz2: k, mom
[08:33:05] <jrockjiggz> ??
[08:34:03] <jrockjiggz> GoSox: there is jQuery.post()
[08:34:39] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: done, the browserheight seems fine, the imgh causes the problem
[08:35:29] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: image loads fine, but resize browser you will see the jump
[08:35:37] <GoSox> great
[08:35:43] <GoSox> now I know what i'm doing tomorrow :D
[08:36:39] <hugo_moss> if i wanted to make a site that uses jquery for desktop and jquery mobile for mobile devices, and i wanted to make it a single site instead of a site that has a mobile version and a full desktop version, how would i go about making it known to make a call to jquery mobile instead of jquery or vice versa, how would i go about doing that or what would be the best way?
[08:36:41] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: ?
[08:37:44] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: imgh changes on reflow: http://i.imgur.com/Cy8aj.png
[08:38:24] <jrockjiggz> hugo_moss: theres quite a few documents on browser sniffing, browser detection, or feature detection..
[08:38:28] <jrockjiggz> ?detect
[08:38:33] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, jQuery.isPlainObject() - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isPlainObject/
[08:38:43] <jrockjiggz> no..
[08:40:30] <jrockjiggz> hugo_moss: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/ there are some good reads there on the links
[08:41:11] <jrockjiggz> hugo_moss: http://modernizr.com/ should be useful for you
[08:41:54] <hugo_moss> jrock: i mean like if i wanted to use the mobile version i'd have to use touch or swipe or tap, double tap, and make a call to jquery mobile, but if i wanted to do a call to click  for desktop, id have the same piece of code but have to know which one is called. i know there is a browser detection using .test navigator agent, so would i just set a boolean variable to find out isMobile, then
[08:41:54] <hugo_moss> call whichever code based on that boolean?
[08:43:54] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: in the end its imgh that gets misinterpreted which is created at 451 and set at line 462, maybe it's about that .load in there
[08:45:30] <jrockjiggz> hugo_moss: I wouldn't lol, it would be messy.. I dont have an answer, i feel most people develop their mobile apps seperate, maybe sharing some backend
[08:47:08] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: aaaand it's always just the first image that gets the weird imgh - maybe its something about timing of events
[08:48:19] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: maybe some callabcks are required...
[08:48:41] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: yeah. but where?
[08:49:00] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: not really inside the script, probably somewhere in my document.ready
[08:49:43] <jrockjiggz> i'm pretty sure is 448 & 449 var img = new Image();
[08:50:57] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: its 451 in my IDE, but yeah - its somewhere in there
[08:51:48] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: maybe I should try changing new Image to document.createElement? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1110406/ie-8-js-call-to-new-image-fails-when-the-code-is-run-in-a-popup-window
[08:52:16] <jrockjiggz> im going to show you how i load images in jquery
[08:52:35] <jrockjiggz> mainly $('<img>').attr('src',url); //will preload image
[08:52:54] <jrockjiggz> prop, rather
[08:54:08] <hugo_moss> if (Modernizr.touch){
[08:54:17] <hugo_moss> like that jrock
[08:54:28] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: OMG!!!! var img = document.createElement("img"); really helps
[08:54:37] <hugo_moss> use touch event else use click events
[08:55:21] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: I mean its still a little stretched, but not as much as before
[08:56:03] <firstclassfunc> > http://pastebin.com/TCPG8JN8 -- I'm confused by this fetchMarkupDoc function, can someone please have a short look
[08:56:07] <Otineb> hey everyone. IM a bit of a JS noob and I've got a few scripts working that call two different libraries. I'm having issues formatting my .js file so that the commands work. I normally have the scripts directly in my header section while calling the libraries. Now I just want to dump the working scripts into a single .js file and call that instead but that seems to stop the functions from working
[08:56:24] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: eg. shit goes crazy in this one: http://werbeagenten.com/unternehmensberatung/marketing/
[08:56:25] <hugo_moss> thanks jrock
[08:56:48] <Otineb> Do I need to put my functions into separate .js files?
[08:56:57] <hugo_moss> with modernizr you can detect if it uses touch, and decide what to use, would you still not recommend to do it this way?
[08:57:28] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: instead of that, try loading the image another way

[09:08:23] <tevz> hello, i have question about jquery ui slider
[09:08:23] <tevz> here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/dvWMg/1/
[09:08:32] <tevz> i need excatcly that distribution as it is on background, and to show slider handler in the middle of interval (so i extended handler to 30px)
[09:08:44] <tevz> the problem is, if you click on the right edge of interval, slider will slide to the next value
[09:08:50] <tevz> i want better solution than this: create 2*48 values and if user click on odds interval, slide the slider to the next value
[09:08:50] <tevz> any suggestion?
[09:09:08] <computer2000> anyone can check my front page on IE7/8 ??
[09:09:12] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: even though it look a LOT better now

[09:10:23] <computer2000> pls, anyone can give a short eye on my website on IE7 or IE8 ?
[09:10:27] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: anonymous function?!
[09:11:13] <tevz> computer2000: use IETester
[09:11:16] <jrockjiggz> =/
[09:11:55] <computer2000> tevz: thats what im doing and strangely i get a never seen problem so i thought the ietester engine could be broken or somewhat...
[09:12:37] <computer2000> tevz: $('#bigHomeImage').height($('#bigHomeImage img').height()); makes the whole document be like 3000px high instead of 500px

[09:14:13] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/G43Na/3/
[09:14:18] <jrockjiggz> i will then look at your page

[09:14:56] <Saaether> imgsrc is not defined
[09:15:06] <jrockjiggz> its from the functin

[09:17:45] <jrockjiggz> yea its because $.superbgCalcSize
[09:17:54] <thomas____> no object attached
[09:18:08] <thomas____> just copied your fiddle :(
[09:18:10] <jrockjiggz> it *was* $(this).superbgCalcSize, but that was inside a .load() function, which would refer to the time...
[09:18:15] <jrockjiggz> *to the image
[09:18:20] <thomas____> yeah
[09:18:22] <thomas____> totally
[09:18:35] <jrockjiggz> I dont see
[09:20:44] <thomas____> thats the old one for reference: http://jsfiddle.net/E4XSR/
[09:20:57] <jrockjiggz> yea i just put $. back to img.
[09:20:57] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/G43Na/4/
[09:22:06] <jrockjiggz> wops
[09:22:24] <thomas____> a lot better, but weird shit in console on imgh
[09:23:13] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/G43Na/5/
[09:23:15] <thomas____> for my learning process: the load function was malicious and your way of inserting an img is better than new Image(), right?
[09:24:02] <jrockjiggz> or change it to $(this), sorry i'm not sure after this
[09:24:04] <firstclassfunc> shoky: ok, thanks. do you have a better way of naming/structuring things w.r.t. my code snippet/
[09:26:38] <jrockjiggz> thomas____: i wouldn't say better, but hopefully not fall victim to IE. you can try my last jsfiddle, but i feel it might have the same problem http://jsfiddle.net/G43Na/5/
[09:27:18] <thomas____> yeah tried it, 4th fiddleedit was better than 5th
[09:28:10] <thomas____> look now: http://werbeagenten.com/unternehmensberatung/marketing/
[09:28:15] <thomas____> in console
[09:28:54] <thomas____> only at first put, after that (eg resize the window) it works fine!
[09:30:59] <jrockjiggz> IE is bogus
[09:31:20] <thomas____> haha
[09:31:25] <thomas____> its horrible
[09:31:35] <thomas____> thats part of jquery in the console right?
[09:31:37] <thomas____> amazing
[09:32:01] <thomas____> ok, what if I trigger the resize event after the image was added to the dom? hacky, but maybe a solution, right?
[09:32:59] <thomas____> can I execute the resize event?
[09:34:16] <jacobroufa> whats everyones favorite js graphing lib or jquery plugin?
[09:37:41] <tw2113> you know, that one, that does that thing with the DOM
[09:39:10] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: yeah I got it!
[09:39:45] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: I changed img.width to img.width() because its now low an "Image" but an DOM element
[09:41:20] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: its completely fixed now. Thank you soooo much for your help, I've learned a lot about JS-Browser-Inconsistencies. Thank your for your time and effort, would have NEVER made it by myself.
[09:41:32] <jrockjiggz> hey i'm glad you got it !
[09:41:45] <thomas____> jrockjiggz: is there anything I could do for you? :-)
[09:42:13] <jrockjiggz> lol, no thank you
[09:42:31] <thomas____> well then have a pleasant evening :-)
[09:43:37] <jrockjiggz> cheers
[09:47:56] <veQue> for every $(:text) that has a data-x == 3 {//do this}  ... how do i go about this the simplest way?
[09:48:47] <veQue> dothis will be $(':text').val('');
[09:49:02] <veQue> ' ' rather
[09:49:40] <veQue> do i have to do a if for each one?
[09:50:34] <veQue> that's the only way i can think of
[09:50:50] <veQue> is there a one bullet way?
[09:51:19] <veQue> hmm
[09:51:32] <veQue> i guess if i had used arrays i couldve done it
[09:52:51] <veQue> with a for loop
[09:54:28] <Saaether> $(":text[a data-x='3']").each(function() { do something } );
[09:54:42] <Saaether> oops bad copy
[09:54:48] <Saaether> $(":text[data-x='3']").each(function() { do something } );
[09:55:47] <Saaether> veQue see above, should work
[09:56:46] <veQue> Saaether:  awesome you just saved me a lot of lines of code
[09:59:54] <veQue>  it works!!
[10:00:23] <Saaether> cool
[10:01:40] <hugo_moss> is that the only way to do it? creating separate mobile and desktop versions of a site? you can't have a hybrid? i find myself hating mobile versions of sites on the ipad because theyre always incomplete with features
[10:04:30] <MistuhKurtz> hugo_moss, you can have a 'hybrid,' with 'responsive CSS' or css media queries
[10:04:50] <MistuhKurtz> it allows you to apply different CSS styles based on stuff like the width of the browser viewport
[10:05:42] <hugo_moss> what if you want to use javascript for a hybrid site?
[10:05:47] <hugo_moss> or jquery mobile?
[10:05:50] <hugo_moss> and jquery
[10:05:54] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/aBuk7/ - am I on the right path trying to get this div to resize if it's below the sidebar?
[10:07:35] <MistuhKurtz> hugo_moss, not too sure how well jQuery mobile would work on a responsive site. I've never used it but my impression is that it's useful for developing mobile-only sites as it mimics common mobile UI elements
[10:08:21] <hugo_moss> yeah
[10:08:37] <MistuhKurtz> hugo_moss, you can most certainly use javascript, but you're going to want to keep your styles/css and interaction/js layers cleanly separated
[10:09:08] <hugo_moss> how do you mean separated?
[10:09:22] <MistuhKurtz> don't want to mix up style and interaction when you can help it
[10:09:54] <hugo_moss> i dont understand, arent they separated by design?
[10:09:59] <hugo_moss> how would you mix the two?
[10:10:34] <abletony84> must leave
[10:10:45] <MistuhKurtz> for example, instead of applying CSS styles directly in javascript, use the javascript to add a class
[10:11:34] <hugo_moss> and then load a stylesheet with css with javascript?
[10:11:41] <hugo_moss> with the css loaded with styling information?
[10:11:49] <hugo_moss> so that they are separate
[10:12:07] <MiracleBlue> Good morning, gentlemen!
[10:19:32] <veQue> good morning MiracleBlue
[10:19:37] <MiracleBlue> :D
[10:19:45] <MiracleBlue> Sup?
[10:23:44] <veQue> makin progress, got side tracked by opera videos on youtube >_> but still making progress
[10:23:48] <veQue> ^_^
[10:23:58] <MiracleBlue> Haha
[10:24:10] <MiracleBlue> veQue: Opera videos, that's pretty cool
[10:24:23] <veQue> hey i want swipe to trigger a animation
[10:24:49] <MiracleBlue> Yep?
[10:24:51] <veQue> like in my text inputs i want it to slide the value off to the left right before it resets
[10:25:03] <veQue> like i'm throwingin the text value away
[10:25:08] <MiracleBlue> Ah cool
[10:25:16] <MiracleBlue> So you want to do that on a swipe action on touch devices?
[10:25:21] <veQue> yeh
[10:25:30] <veQue> i got swipe to clear
[10:25:31] <MiracleBlue> Are you using a swipe event plugin at all?
[10:25:33] <veQue> but no animation
[10:25:38] <veQue> no just swipe
[10:25:48] <veQue> the jquery method
[10:25:52] <MiracleBlue> Oh, right
[10:25:54] <veQue> swipeleft to be precise
[10:25:57] <MiracleBlue> I didn't know that existed actually haha
[10:26:04] <MiracleBlue> Alright, well, it has a callback, right?
[10:26:22] <MiracleBlue> Just put your animation logic in the callback.
[10:26:28] <veQue> i wish i knew what callback meant right baout now
[10:26:32] <MiracleBlue> Oh, sorry.
[10:26:43] <MiracleBlue> You know how you pass it a function to execute when the swipe happens?
[10:26:52] <MiracleBlue> Like, clearing the textbox
[10:27:08] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/aUAws/
[10:27:27] <veQue> yes
[10:27:39] <veQue> ok i think i got you
[10:27:50] <MiracleBlue> Yeah there you go.  Put your animation logic inside that function before the $(this).val('');
[10:28:09] <veQue> ok .animate right
[10:28:16] <MiracleBlue> Yes sir :)
[10:28:20] <veQue> awesome
[10:39:40] <hugo_moss> mistuhkurtz: i read this article: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/19/building-relationship-between-css-javascript/
[10:40:22] <hugo_moss> but why even use jquery at all then? if you can't use its methods?
[10:40:48] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/aUAws/9/ MiracleBlue =P ...
[10:40:57] <MistuhKurtz> I don't follow hugo_moss
[10:41:04] <veQue> if i want just the value can i add a .val somewhere?
[10:41:38] <hugo_moss> well its suggesting to not use .hide() for example
[10:41:47] <MiracleBlue> veQue: yep
[10:41:56] <MiracleBlue> You just call .val on its own and it will give you the value.
[10:42:31] <hugo_moss> or .fadeout
[10:42:40] <hugo_moss> instead create css stylesheet rules for that
[10:42:48] <hugo_moss> so you can separate the javascript and css layers
[10:43:12] <hugo_moss> but then you would have to ignore portions of jquery that make it easier for you to write it in the first place
[10:43:29] <MistuhKurtz> it's not an absolute rule
[10:43:41] <veQue> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/04/select-text-in-input-box-on-user-select.html
[10:43:57] <veQue> .select it says
[10:44:03] <MistuhKurtz> it's up to you as the developer to choose how to implement. it's more of a guideline.
[10:44:48] <MistuhKurtz> but I don't have time to talk about conceptual problems of code abstraction, so I must take my leave
[10:44:58] <hugo_moss> i think it has a good intention
[10:45:24] <veQue> MistuhKurtz: got time for a practical solution?
[10:45:50] <MiracleBlue> veQue: Oh
[10:45:59] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/aUAws/9/
[10:46:02] <MiracleBlue> Are you trying to make it highlight the text?
[10:46:08] <veQue> no
[10:46:23] <veQue> just want sswipe to animate a throwing to the left of text
[10:46:40] <veQue> then seting value as ' '
[10:47:36] <veQue> just need to know how to select the value
[10:47:40] <MiracleBlue> Right, yes.  Sorry.  .select highlights the text in an input box, doesn't it?
[10:47:53] <MiracleBlue> If you call .val with no arguments, it returns the actual value.
[10:59:24] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/7ksWA/268/ i was looking over this script and it had me fooled for a second
[10:59:57] <filipiz> ? ajax

[11:08:23] <hugo_moss> data-* attributes
[11:08:32] <MiracleBlue> Of course.

[11:57:02] <Birliban> hi, on loading a page i want to put some database data fetched via server side into an js object and work with that data via jquery. whats the best way to store this? array? object? i want to build it with iterating.
[12:00:35] <Cronoh> up to you, if its simply database results i personally might go with array since i find it quicker but they are pretty close to the same
[12:01:29] <veQue> mek1 i am guessing dropdown has some defaults that need to be overridden
[12:02:12] <mek1> veQue: Yeah, when clicking the link to open the popover i use e.stopPropagation(); but i cant mange to find a way to keep it open if i click inside the popover
[12:03:09] <veQue> yeh no ideal
[12:03:48] <veQue> i tried adding a stopPropagation() to the other thing
[12:04:03] <veQue> can you try two stopPropagations?
[12:04:37] <mek1> Yeah I just dont know how to get "it" to stop on the right thing :)
[12:04:47] <veQue> i think the stopPropagation is working
[12:05:01] <andrew9184> i hate my code, my whole damn code is a million if and elses
[12:05:01] <veQue> becaus when i reopen the dropdown banana is still open
[12:05:26] <veQue> andrew yeh so is mine
[12:05:45] <Cronoh> continue to work on making your code better
[12:06:06] <Cronoh> learn better ways to accomplish your task
[12:07:26] <mek1> veQue: the popover is still open because thats how it works (if i got it right) the problem is when you click inside the input then dropdown itself goes away
[12:08:21] <veQue> i'm just trying to guess code it.. i porbably should read documentation on the stopPropagation
[12:09:15] <Birliban> Cronoh, ok, is an array also quicker in filtering data?
[12:09:43] <kfir> Hey, is there a way to merge between two instances of TBG?
[12:10:29] <kfir> I have two installations that are disconnected from each other and I would like to merge the data between them and update them every once in a while
[12:11:13] <NCS_One> hi
[12:12:05] <NCS_One> what could make a script work on my local server but fail on a remote server? its a ajax call, maybe some delay?
[12:14:51] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/sailorob/HDxNm/ mek1 not what you want  exactly
[12:14:55] <veQue> but i found this
[12:15:10] <veQue> fadeIn
[12:19:02] <ItsJustMe> how to sort some div's depending on html5-data-attributes and user specification via dropdown?
[12:19:13] <ItsJustMe> from lowest to highest one
[12:19:22] <ItsJustMe> and way back
[12:19:41] <mek1> Anyone know a way to "debug" what jqeury events are fired when and by what?
[12:20:12] <Ogredude_> is there a better way to find out if a radio button is checked than $("selector").is(":checked") ?
[12:20:32] <goddard> i am getting "/home/user/public_html/components/com_cbactivity/helpers/Restricted access" when using Jquery.get
[12:20:33] <goddard> any idea how i can fix
[12:21:22] <Eviltwin> goddard: see ?sop
[12:21:23] <bot-t> goddard, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[12:21:46] <Eviltwin> Ogredude_: $("selector")[0].checked is fsater
[12:22:03] <Eviltwin> But the string "checked" will have to be in there either way
[12:22:09] <Eviltwin> So you're not going to get much shorter than that
[12:22:28] <Eviltwin> ItsJustMe: By sort, do you mean sort the collection or reorder the elements on the page?
[12:22:33] <Ogredude_> Eviltwin: thanks
[12:22:45] <ItsJustMe> reorder ..
[12:22:54] <ItsJustMe> they get loaded and then shall be sorted Eviltwin
[12:23:12] <Eviltwin> Are they all inside the same parent
[12:23:20] <ItsJustMe> yes, they are ..
[12:23:45] <ItsJustMe> <div id="container"><div class="offer"></div></div>
[12:29:11] <goddard> Eviltwin: any idea on what url I should put into my Jquery.get() ? because i tried http:// and www. and just the /path/to/file/blah.php
[12:29:28] <Eviltwin> ItsJustMe: http://jsfiddle.net/HdyhA/
[12:29:35] <NoiseEee> goddard: your own app is redirecting you dude.
[12:29:43] <Eviltwin> goddard: What URL does your page have?
[12:30:30] <ItsJustMe> Eviltwin: Thanks a lot!
[12:32:23] <goddard> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/g8dZepev
[12:32:36] <andrew9184> i would pay for someone to teach me how to code js better
[12:33:09] <Eviltwin> Why jQuery 1.5.0
[12:33:50] <goddard> Eviltwin: its a very large old project
[12:33:52] <BillCriswell> I remember using 1.4 and 1.6... but never 1.5. Weird.
[12:34:00] <Eviltwin> andrew9184: Ha ha, that's a hard thing to do
[12:34:13] <Eviltwin> No guarantees your teacher would be successful either
[12:35:37] <Eviltwin> goddard: Copy-paste what's in your URL bar
[12:35:48] <Eviltwin> Changing to www.url.com if necessary
[12:35:55] <Eviltwin> But don't change anything else
[12:37:17] <andrew9184> i think it doesnt help that i always work on these weird, one off projects
[12:37:24] <andrew9184> i don't really code anything ive done before
[12:37:50] <goddard> Eviltwin: http://www.url.com/my-page
[12:38:19] <Eviltwin> Okay, try var url = '/components/com_cbactivity/add-on1/helpers/commentupdate.php'
[12:38:23] <Eviltwin> At line 3
[12:38:25] <Eviltwin> instead
[12:41:12] <goddard> Eviltwin: same result
[12:41:23] <Eviltwin> You sure?
[12:41:33] <Eviltwin> Did you actually view the source?
[12:41:38] <Eviltwin> Make sure the change is reflected
[12:41:47] <Birliban> could jQuery.grep() be a good approach to filter an array?
[12:42:16] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:42:24] <NoiseEee> goddard: your own app is redirecting you because the URL you're trying to access is presumably not being passed correct authentication details
[12:42:50] <Eviltwin> Birliban: Literally in the description: "Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function."
[12:43:32] <Birliban> Eviltwin, for having an input field that filters an array on keypress and puts the result into a <select>?
[12:43:36] <goddard> Eviltwin: yes and its the same "/home/user/www/components/cb_activity/helpers/Restriced access
[12:43:45] <goddard> NoiseEee: i see
[12:43:54] <Eviltwin> goddard: Where the hell is this /home/user/www coming from?
[12:44:23] <Eviltwin> Birliban: Sure
[12:44:58] <Birliban> Eviltwin, ok, thanks!
[12:45:03] <goddard> Eviltwin: oh it is as NoiseEee said related to a joomla access restriction defined('_JEXEC') or die(dirname(__FILE__).DS.'Restricted access');
[12:45:15] <goddard> not to be confused with Access to restricted URI
[12:45:30] <Eviltwin> Oh, then go see #joomla or whatever
[12:45:35] <goddard> man thanks
[12:45:35] <Eviltwin> No longer our problem
[12:45:46] <goddard> :D thanks
[12:54:24] <mek1> Looking on https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-dropdown.js it looks like a click is bind to "html" and that makes the dropdown close when I click"outside" the menu?
[12:56:02] <konradb> hi
[12:56:24] <mek1> Hello
[12:56:59] <konradb> how can I change <span> value by typing string into <input type="text without sending form?
[13:03:05] <veQue> mek1 get it working?
[13:03:25] <alwayslearning> hey guys, does anyone have any experience working with bxSlider? How do i set the amount the of horizontal scroll that happens with the pager controls. I'm truly stumped
[13:03:55] <mek1> Not really, it looks from the link above that the "close" fires when click event is catched from 'html' but I have no idea how I can/should prevent that
[13:04:27] <andrew9184> whats the difference between foobar : function() { } and function foobar() {} ?
[13:04:30] <veQue> hmm must be a way
[13:04:46] <veQue> come to think of it i dont really see text boxes in dropdowns
[13:07:07] <danzik17> andrew9184: it's a function expression vs a function declaration.  see http://kangax.github.com/nfe/#expr-vs-decl
[13:11:19] <initself> is there a way to pass a YYYY-MM-DD date string into Date() and have it give me a proper object?

[13:14:10] <initself> .split("-") is a nice method an all
[13:14:20] <initself> but that requires me to....create a string object, maybe?
[13:14:37] * initself goes with "yes".
[13:15:56] <alwayslearning> I'm initself i dont know enough to be of help
[13:16:01] <alwayslearning> *I'm sorry

[13:37:43] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQ
[13:38:58] <TelFiRE> Does anyone do anything special for mobile? I mean if I do a simple slidetoggle, or really any kind of animation, I get extremely choppy animation.
[13:39:46] <mek1> veQue: I think I found it now
[13:40:05] <veQue> great mek1
[13:40:20] <veQue> i'm having animation problems of my own
[13:40:41] <Jee5us> Hi! I havve a problem. I'm trying to find the next element in my list that has the class "visible"
[13:40:44] <Jee5us> how to?
[13:40:52] <veQue> some times i need animations to run at the same time and sometimes i need them to run back to back
[13:42:34] <veQue> Jee5us http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3670136/jquery-find-next-element-by-class might help
[13:46:15] <Jee5us> veQue:thanks... i had the selector wrong..derp
[13:49:07] <mek1> So to see that I clicked inside the right window I use if ($(event.target).parents(".popover")), but it looks like it returns true even if it dont find the parent+
[13:50:11] <Eviltwin> It does
[13:51:21] <Eviltwin> http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics
[13:51:28] <Eviltwin> Look under the heading "Did my selection get anything?"
[13:53:00] <mek1> .. thanks Eviltwin
[13:53:13] <Eviltwin> .. you're welcome
[13:53:14] <b-ot> Eviltwin, no YOU'RE welcome
[13:54:04] <Eviltwin> rmill: Not sure that's useful
[13:54:48] <rmill> lol
[13:55:18] <rmill> b-ot: you're being BAD
[13:55:18] <b-ot> rmill, no YOU'RE being BAD
[13:55:57] <Eviltwin> b-ot: you're an evil twin of bot-t
[13:55:57] <b-ot> Eviltwin, no YOU'RE an evil twin of bot-t
[13:55:58] <andheiberg> When does lines execute in jQuery/Javascript? I have a function that changes say 10 elements in the dom, however they do not execute one after the other, but rather all at once.
[13:56:05] <mek1> veQue: Solution ended with http://jsfiddle.net/CuYQs/9/ and working as I wanted
[13:56:25] <Eviltwin> andheiberg: I don't know what that means
[13:57:06] <rmill> b-ot: Will you eat us come judgment day?
[13:57:06] <b-ot> rmill, it is decidedly so.
[13:57:29] <Eviltwin> Not sure we need bot toys in here
[13:57:35] <Eviltwin> I think there's already enough noise
[13:58:13] <rmill> bot-t does the same thing.
[13:58:36] <rmill> bot-t: is Eviltwin being a prude?
[13:58:38] <bot-t> rmill, Cannot predict now.
[13:58:43] <rmill> Shame.
[13:59:01] <andheiberg> Eviltwin: I have a function. This function contains 10 lines that changes the value of a string in the dom. Each line has to get some information from another place so there is some lag. The lag for all the lines combined is around 1 sec. My question is if it is possible for each line to fire as soon as it is ready, and not when all ten lines are ready.
[13:59:27] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ andheiberg
[13:59:28] <bot-t> andheiberg, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[14:01:34] <andheiberg> bot-t: I will give it a try....
[14:01:52] <bot-t> andheiberg, draggable with clone won't work after first drop - Bug Tracker - jQuery - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8462
[14:01:58] <monsieur_h> Or as L. Thorvald says: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
[14:02:25] <Eviltwin> I prefer mine
[14:02:40] <monsieur_h> It's more polite, but less catchy
[14:02:51] <rmill> bot-t: I love you
[14:02:52] <bot-t> no you don't
[14:03:15] <Eviltwin> b-ot: is is is
[14:03:15] <b-ot> Eviltwin, memorised â€œisâ€.
[14:03:20] <b-ot> Eviltwin, is
[14:03:30] <rmill> lol
[14:03:31] <NoiseEee> lol
[14:03:40] <rmill> b-ot: forget is
[14:03:41] <b-ot> rmill, I have forgotten â€œisâ€.
[14:03:57] <Eviltwin> To be fair I meant to target the other bot
[14:04:59] <b-ot> Eviltwin, why you gotta play me like that?
[14:15:36] <TelFiRE> Why is animation so choppy on mobile devices? Is there a trick to it or should I be subbing out the library and having different js even though it's basically the same actions?
[14:16:28] <andheiberg> bot-t: jsfiddle doesn't seam to for for me?
[14:16:29] <bot-t> andheiberg, Most likely.
[14:25:19] <andheiberg> +bot-t: http://codepen.io/anon/full/syCzm
[14:25:34] <andheiberg> See how all the p changes value at the same time?
[14:28:15] <andheiberg> Can anyone help me with this? http://codepen.io/anon/full/syCzm
[14:29:39] <Eviltwin> Solution
[14:29:43] <Eviltwin> Don't do the lots of long math
[14:30:33] <andheiberg> That's no solution. There must be some way of executing the que asyncronosly
[14:31:51] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't be trying to do extensive computations in the browser
[14:35:13] <veQue> i need help with animations
[14:35:16] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/Dbbum/5/
[14:35:28] <veQue> i want to run two animations at the same time easy
[14:35:30] <someprimetime> damn that code pen is taking forever to load
[14:35:43] <veQue> but then i want to do two other things AFTER the animation...
[14:35:47] <someprimetime> css tricks is ok but codepen is kinda weak imo
[14:35:52] <veQue> my code runs everything at the same time
[14:36:27] <veQue> someprimetime: still in beta i bet
[14:36:32] <veQue> i've used it and like it
[14:36:46] <veQue> jsfiddle is the best i think
[14:36:47] <someprimetime> jsfiddle > jsbin > codepen > pastebin > codepad
[14:37:06] <veQue> someprimetime: any experience with animations?
[14:37:31] <someprimetime> veQue: depends what kind of animations.. from your demo it just said Done a bunch of times and nothing happened
[14:37:33] <andheiberg> Eviltwin: But say I wanted to do it? How whould I get around this?
[14:37:40] <someprimetime> sup Eviltwin
[14:37:56] <veQue> someprimetime: oh sorry
[14:38:00] <Eviltwin> andheiberg: Use WebWorkers
[14:38:09] <veQue> text text in one of the text inputs and wipe left
[14:38:22] <veQue> it show animate the text moving to he left then reset itself
[14:38:29] <veQue> type text i mean
[14:38:41] <veQue> but it does everything at the same time
[14:38:55] <someprimetime> use a callback to trigger the other ones
[14:38:57] <veQue> can i tell animation to finish first before doing something else?
[14:39:01] <veQue> how?
[14:39:08] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: He put some absurd thing like var i = 9999999999; while (i > 0) i--; or something
[14:39:10] <veQue> second time i heard callback today
[14:39:12] <someprimetime> usually as an added parameter in animate()
[14:39:14] <Eviltwin> In that codepad
[14:39:35] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: ah i tried to click edit but that tab froze
[14:40:40] <andheiberg> Eviltwin thanks for your help
[14:45:29] <veQue> O_O too many parenthsis curlys to comprehend
[14:45:36] <veQue> bah
[14:45:42] * veQue bashes head on keyboard
[14:46:38] <veQue> someprimetime: can you help?
[14:47:25] <someprimetime> ?deferred @ veQue
[14:47:25] <bot-t> veQue, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[14:47:29] <Eviltwin> veQue: Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Dbbum/6/
[14:47:30] <someprimetime> that's what you want to use
[14:47:53] <someprimetime> or use Eviltwin's solution since he knows what he's talking about :p
[15:06:08] <bigLanky> i am trying to build something like http://screencast.com/t/K3mi48mWw - The idea behind this is that there are 4 triangles here. When you hover over one of the triangles, a new hover image loads. Anyone know how to do this or can point me in the right direction?
[15:07:29] <acidjazz> i got this situation where im doing a scrollTop(0) and a scrollLeft(0).. is there any way i can do this while animating it via css? i tried adding transitions to the div.. no go
[15:17:47] <coldhead> acidjazz: .animate({scrollTop: 0, scrollLeft: 0}, 'slow') ?
[15:19:55] <acidjazz> coldhead: i wnat to use transitions.. i want it to be hardware accelerated
[15:21:09] <coldhead> ah, my apologies
[15:21:12] <coldhead> i've never tried that
[15:22:30] <coldhead> acidjazz: you probably already saw this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9292070/how-to-use-the-same-method-of-jquery-scrolltop-with-css3
[15:23:41] <acidjazz> hashes eh?
[15:23:42] <acidjazz> hmm
[15:24:13] <coldhead> the 2nd answer is more animatey
[15:24:22] <coldhead> but not esp. promising either
[15:24:39] <coldhead> i guess CSS3 would have you do it with margins
[15:30:13] <acidjazz> coldhead: my issue is im not scrolling the window.. im scrolling inside a particular div
[15:33:26] <coldhead> acidjazz: that's what i thought, which is why i thought you might be able to do it with margins
[15:33:52] <coldhead> but i'm pretty new at this, probably best to ignore me
[15:37:37] <Birliban> hi... how to call it, if you wrote some dozen lines of js code without testing it and after finishing it and call the work in browser and everything works like a charm ;-)
[15:38:01] <Birliban> luck :-P
[15:39:40] <coldhead> excellent workmanship, Birliban
[15:39:45] <coldhead> outstanding competence
[15:39:51] <coldhead> and the gods have smiled upon you
[15:39:58] <coldhead> great work!
[15:49:19] <Birliban> coldhead, u're soo good to me ;-)
[15:49:46] <Birliban> this thing happens about one time out of 20 ^^
[15:56:53] <azbyin> hi all.
[15:57:25] <coldhead> hi azbsy
[15:57:34] <azbyin> is there an el.remove() with fadeout ?
[15:57:51] <azbyin> or do i have to call remove within the finished callback of fadeout ?
[15:57:54] <raj> does hiding an element remove its bindings for when I make it show again??
[15:58:02] <raj> event bindings
[15:58:08] <shoky> raj: nope
[15:58:26] <azbyin> jqel.fadeOut('fast', function(){jqel.remove();});  ?
[15:58:57] <goddard> if i have a link id and i want to grab the id from the link that is in the form "javascript:showfield(20279)"
[15:58:59] <coldhead> yeah gotta use the callback
[15:59:07] <raj> damn
[15:59:12] <azbyin> coldhead, thanks.. hows the first day of jquery going so far?
[15:59:29] <coldhead> a little scary but i'm getting through it thx azbyin!
[16:00:24] <coldhead> ?eval "javascript:showfield(20279)".match(/(\d+)/)
[16:00:33] <azbyin> raj, if you want to move the element to somewhere else in the document tree, you might want to use detach() as that preserves the bindings (on that detached element) and appendTo or append to the new parent
[16:00:34] <coldhead> come on bot-t
[16:00:39] <bot-t> coldhead: No output. (Process Killed)
[16:00:45] <coldhead> ?eval "javascript:showfield(20279)".match(/(\d+)/)
[16:00:48] <bot-t> coldhead: ["20279", "20279"]
[16:00:53] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[16:00:53] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[16:01:07] <coldhead> bot-t: do you think that changes how i feel about you?
[16:01:07] <bot-t> coldhead, Signs point to yes.
[16:01:15] <coldhead> NO IT DOESN'T. THE SIGNS ARE WRONG
[16:02:21] <sear> Hi guys.  I'm having an issue under Firefox.  I included the untouched jQuery source in my page, but Firefox is telling me there's a syntax error in that source
[16:02:21] <sear> http://i.imgur.com/yg6wW.png
[16:02:27] <sear> Any idea what might be going on?
[16:03:09] <coldhead> sear: try includig jQuery from a CDN and see if the same issue occurs
[16:03:17] <azbyin> sear, show us your html
[16:03:29] <coldhead> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js
[16:03:31] <azbyin> i.e. your inclusion of jquery.min.js
[16:04:24] <sear> azbyin: Full HTML can be found here: http://pastebin.com/Lrcij9ad
[16:04:32] <sear> I put it in pastebin before you made your stipulation :P
[16:04:50] <sear> coldhead: Will try from a CDN.
[16:09:35] <sear> Hmm.  Interesting.  It's now complaining about jQuery-UI.
[16:10:43] <coldhead> sear: can you load the included files in your browser?
[16:11:07] <coldhead> maybe your server is doing some nasty routing thing
[16:12:21] <sear> coldhead, Seems everything checks out: http://pastebin.com/psYxnb0H
[16:13:31] <coldhead> yeah that looks reasonable
[16:14:39] <coldhead> what about if you load http://herpderp.me:6500/script/jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js in your browser?
[16:14:44] <coldhead> does it look like the right thing?
[16:15:09] <sear> Yeah, it seems correct.
[16:15:22] <coldhead> spluh
[16:15:29] <sear> o_O
[16:18:23] <shoky> sear: pastebin what you get for http://herpderp.me:6500/script/jquery.min.js
[16:19:03] <sear> The server is open to the world.  Clicking that link will show you.
[16:19:08] <shoky> o
[16:21:33] <coldhead> sear: i see crud like this at the end of yoru JS files ;})(jQuery);HTTP/1.0 404 File not found
[16:21:34] <coldhead> Connection: close
[16:21:47] <coldhead> like you're doing some concatenation on the server?
[16:22:00] <sear> Ah!  Interesting.  Must be a bug in the server I wrote for this thing.  :P
[16:22:04] <coldhead> that's at the end of http://herpderp.me:6500/script/jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js
[16:22:09] <sear> coldhead, thanks much!
[16:22:16] <coldhead> i don't know why it doesn't happen in chrome
[16:22:22] <coldhead> user agent sniffing mebbe?
[16:22:24] <coldhead> good luck sir
[16:22:27] <coldhead> it's a hard road
[16:22:31] <sear> coldhead, Thanks <3
[16:28:35] <coldhead> the roots and the ruins are the same thing
[16:28:58] <mlang> Is there a way that I can scope the selector somehow?
[16:29:16] <coldhead> $('someselect', starting_node) ?
[16:31:08] <mlang> coldhead: Not quite was I was looking for, I guess. I'm iteration through different records, they all have the same classes. So if I click on an element, I want the selector to have it select the element in the same container, not the entire page.
[16:31:18] <mlang> And yes, this description is quite bad, but I don't know who to put it.
[16:31:37] <coldhead> $(this).closest('tr').find('.someotherthing')
[16:31:39] <coldhead> ?closest
[16:31:40] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[16:32:10] <mlang> Ah! Okay! :)
[16:32:23] <mlang> Thanks :)
[16:33:43] <coldhead> gluck
[16:40:09] <mlang> coldhead: The Problem is, it goes up one - and then the element is a 'sister'-element.
[16:40:36] <azbyin> you mean 'sibling'
[16:40:42] <coldhead> ?nextall
[16:40:42] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[16:40:51] <coldhead> also prevAll() and siblings()
[16:41:11] <coldhead> there's sure to be some combination that describes your particular family tree
[16:41:15] <coldhead> lol incest
[16:41:19] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[16:41:36] <coldhead> what, my sisters are hot, i can admit that
[16:41:46] <azbyin> unless he gives a concrete example showing a tree with which exact selection he wants, its hard to guess
[16:41:46] <mlang> Sorry :>
[16:41:54] <mlang> Didn't know what the right nomenclature was.
[16:42:19] <coldhead> so you link him to some options and hope for the best, azbyin
[16:42:30] <azbyin> lol, no..
[16:42:31] <coldhead> it's what we in the legal fraternity call "a matter for yourself"
[16:42:46] <azbyin> mlang, give us an example of a tree and which element(s) you want matched
[16:42:58] <azbyin> then we might be able to help you out
[16:43:11] <sunbeam> $(".flex-direction-nav li a")
[16:43:18] <sunbeam> inside this i like to add a span, how can i best do this?
[16:43:21] <mlang> azbyin: https://gist.github.com/4158230
[16:43:54] <mlang> What's going to happen - Click on the #expand, and then show the .orderdetails
[16:44:17] <coldhead> ?append @ sunbeam
[16:44:18] <bot-t> sunbeam, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[16:44:53] <coldhead> $(".flex-direction-nav li a").append('<span>-_-</span>')
[16:45:05] <azbyin> mlang, err.. you do realise that this is ##javascript, right?
[16:45:21] <azbyin> err.. #jquery :D
[16:45:33] <mlang> azbyin: I do, couldn't find a better way to get the DOM :>
[16:45:36] <coldhead> whew, for a second i thought i was unbanned from ##javascript
[16:45:42] <azbyin> lol coldhead
[16:45:42] <mlang> Just simply extract it from the Browser Source?
[16:46:05] <azbyin> i don;t know the relevant selector engine/library in ruby
[16:46:06] <coldhead> mlang: inspect with your debugger and "copy as HTML"
[16:46:12] <NCS_One> hi
[16:46:16] <NCS_One> what could make a script work on my local server but fail on a remote server? its a ajax call, maybe some delay?
[16:46:21] <sunbeam> coldhead: thanks
[16:46:54] <coldhead> NCS_One: are you trying to do ajax across domains?
[16:46:57] <azbyin> NCS_One, is it doing a cross domain $.ajax call ?
[16:47:03] * coldhead bows out
[16:47:07] <azbyin> hah
[16:47:13] <mlang> azbyin: https://gist.github.com/4158256
[16:47:15] <mlang> Better? :)
[16:48:18] <azbyin> mlang, ok. your html is not valid. you have 2 span elements with id="expand"
[16:48:51] <mlang> azbyin: Okay.. Fixed that.
[16:49:20] <azbyin> also, put this on jsfiddle or jsbin, etc. easier to perform live matching
[16:49:33] <NCS_One> coldhead, azbyin: no, its from client to server
[16:50:12] <azbyin> yeah, is the ajax target server the same as the server which served the webpage?
[16:50:37] <azbyin> if not, this is the very definition of 'cross domain' ajax request
[16:51:04] <NCS_One> azbyin: its the same
[16:51:30] <mlang> azbyin: It just was meant to see the Tree. Not really how it works?
[16:51:34] <azbyin> paste some code.. and are you looking at the developer console in chrome/firebug ?
[16:52:10] <coldhead> NCS_One: can you link us to the an example?
[16:52:35] <azbyin> mlang, and your point being? you want to perform the selector query and get element(s) back in js within a browser as the client?
[16:52:46] <azbyin> or do you want to this stuff within ruby?
[16:53:00] <azbyin> i'm not understanding your problem!
[16:53:18] <mlang> azbyin: No worries then, I just wanted to ask what function to use to actually find a sibling element up the dom tree. I didn't know it was such a big deal.
[16:53:52] <mlang> Imagine that: I want to go up one-left in the DOM Tree. I actually think it's easier to imagine it light that, that now digging through my entire Code.
[16:55:10] <azbyin> dude! what language/environment do you want to do this in? if JS (&jquery) within a browser (& maybe even node.js), you may be in the right channel
[16:55:22] <azbyin> otherwise you are definitely in the wrong channel!
[16:56:13] <azbyin> different languages and different libraries within those will offer different ways to query the tree
[16:56:19] <mlang> azbyin: No, its jQuery. I just pasted in the HAML, as i fought it would be a little bit cleaner.
[16:57:40] <shoky> up one-left? you want an uncle?
[16:57:59] <shoky> .parent().prev() is one example..
[16:58:31] <shoky> .closest('.classA').siblings('.classB') is another
[16:58:58] <mlang> shaky - In that case, yes, let's title it Uncle. Thanks, thats kinda was I'm looking for.
[17:01:54] <mlang> azbyin: I didn't mean to offend you. I'm sorry if I did. I just think there is way too much overhead for such a simple question.
[17:04:53] <azbyin> no need to apologise. i simply didn't understand the question. you pasted some haml code. then pasted the html(which was the right thing to do). then said you pasted just to see the tree and not really how it works
[17:05:02] <azbyin> so i got confused as to what exactly you were asking
[17:05:50] <mlang> Sorry about that - I hope its a little bit more clear now?
[17:06:08] <azbyin> ofcourse
[17:06:09] <shoky> mlang: it would be clearest with a simple minimal testcase on jsfiddle.net
[17:06:41] <shoky> something like <div> <p> hi <span>lol</span> <span>wow</span> </p> <p> hey </p> </div>
[17:06:45] <shoky> would've even been enough.
[17:07:03] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky I say YO YO YO HOWS IT CRACKIN MY BROMOSEXUAL G DAWG B
[17:07:04] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:07:15] <mlang> shoky, azbyin http://jsfiddle.net/G2Ypz/ Here :)
[17:07:46] <mlang> shoky: I see. its quite different over there in the Rails Channel, sorry - Just getting used to that every community has its own little quirks :)
[17:07:50] <shoky> that doesnt help without you saying which element you're on and which you wanna get to, etc..
[17:08:30] <mlang> shoky: Okay, I want to show the div.orderdetails when i click the corresponding span.expandorder.
[17:11:06] <shoky> $('span.expandorder').click(function() { $(this).closest('p.twelve').next('.orderdetails').show() });
[17:11:26] <shoky> for example
[17:12:45] <azbyin> shouldn't that be .prev('.orderdetails') ?
[17:12:56] <shoky> why prev?
[17:13:16] <shoky> the orderdetails is after the <p> holding the clicked span
[17:13:31] <azbyin> ok
[17:13:49] <mlang> Jepp.
[17:14:10] <azbyin> i didn;t see the entire thing..
[17:14:19] <mlang> Doesn't work tough :(
[17:15:39] <mlang> And.. Yepp, it does, just wrong implementation in the Asset Pipeline, my bad :(
[17:15:45] <mlang> Thanks, shoky and azbyin!
[17:34:16] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[17:37:05] <abjorn> sure thing, boss
[17:40:01] <veQue> hi i want to hide the blinking cursor
[17:40:05] <veQue> in a type:text
[17:40:19] <veQue> i tried cursor:none but that's the mouse cursor
[17:41:35] <coldhead> veQue: apparently you can't do that in CSS
[17:41:54] <coldhead> here is a way to do it with a textarea overlay http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3671141/hide-textfield-blinking-cursor
[17:42:00] <coldhead> reading it nearly made me throw up
[17:44:26] <veQue> .>_
[17:44:29] <veQue> ._>
[17:44:34] <veQue> yeh
[17:44:39] <azbyin> uh.. hiding the caret
[17:44:40] <veQue> i'm not using that
[17:44:40] <azbyin> bleh
[17:44:49] <veQue> coldhead: thanks
[17:44:54] <azbyin> why exactly do you need it to be hidden?
[17:45:20] <azbyin> it makes sense to show it as the user knows where he/she/it is typing
[17:45:21] <veQue> well it's gonna be a mobile app
[17:45:31] <veQue> i will highlight the whole input
[17:45:39] <veQue> and i have a swipe to reset data
[17:45:53] <veQue> so they will know where to put data
[17:46:25] <veQue> i swear i keep telling myself i'm gonna finish this project tongith
[17:46:36] <veQue> and i speak hours debugging this mess
[17:46:42] <veQue> spend
[17:46:45] <veQue> geez
[17:46:52] <veQue> i cant even do english
[17:46:56] <veQue> let alone jquery
[17:48:07] <veQue> you know what screw it i am going to finish this
[17:48:18] <veQue> i dont care if i have to start drinking coffee
[17:59:10] <coldhead> coffee good
[18:01:43] <ML74> Can anyone help with this? The page always reloads if an error exists and i can't figure out why. Any help would be appreciated! https://gist.github.com/29d15982e4498e1d9d81
[18:04:19] <coldhead> ML74: do you see the other stuff happen before it reloads?
[18:04:27] <ML74> yeah
[18:04:28] <coldhead> like the error message or the sliding down?
[18:04:39] <coldhead> soit's just the return false that isn't working?
[18:04:47] <ML74> yeah, seems to be
[18:04:52] <coldhead> maybe you want to use ?preventdefault
[18:04:52] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[18:05:01] <coldhead> then you can use that at the start of the handler
[18:05:07] <coldhead> and not have to do it at the end
[18:05:23] <coldhead> .submit(function (e) {... e.preventDefault(); ...
[18:09:47] <veQue> o_O
[18:09:54] <veQue> a syntaxerror
[18:10:02] <veQue> alowly syntax error
[18:10:19] <veQue> a molecule of a syntax error
[18:10:30] <veQue> oh well it works now
[18:16:28] <coldhead> good work, veQue
[18:16:43] <coldhead> why don't you take 5 minutes and get yourself something sticky and sweet
[18:21:03] <veQue> epic streaming music playing right on cue

[18:23:52] <MiracleBlue> Nice
[18:23:54] <MiracleBlue> Vangelis
[18:24:07] <coldhead> i meant share the jQUery :D
[18:24:22] <veQue> oh
[18:24:24] <veQue> lol
[18:26:48] <veQue> let me do a commit
[18:29:12] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/Dbbum/10/
[18:29:57] <veQue> basically there's some missing code that i have that changes the style of the calculated value
[18:30:36] <veQue> but basically swipe just resets the one you want to reset and any calculated fields
[18:30:43] <veQue> not much to look at
[18:31:14] <veQue> but i guess going from 0 jquery 8das ago to now aint bad
[18:31:21] <veQue> days
[18:32:11] <veQue> you can type a number and slide it away
[18:32:13] <veQue> >_>
[18:32:20] <coldhead> that's pretty cool, veQue
[18:32:26] <veQue> \o/
[18:32:29] <veQue> thanks
[18:32:30] <coldhead> you're writing it almost like a native
[18:32:40] <coldhead> and it does what you want in just a few lines
[18:32:43] <coldhead> that's living the dream
[18:32:45] <veQue> my next project wont take nearly as long
[18:33:38] <veQue> now do you know how to make it stop displayinging NaN?

[19:17:33] <veQue> coldhead: let me guess you use firefox?
[19:18:21] <veQue> i ask because i just tried my code in chrome and not working
[19:31:48] <badbandit> hello, I am implementing stripe.js for first time in a django project, how would I go about removing the "name" attribute from all the cc fields?
[19:31:56] <badbandit> just removeAttr("name")?
[19:32:34] <coldhead> veQue: i use a bunch of different browsers
[19:32:39] <coldhead> don't pigeonhole me, man
[19:33:16] <veQue> i think something is up with chrome's padding
[19:33:26] <veQue> it's not animating properly with jquery
[19:33:32] <coldhead> are you using normalise.css or reset.css ?
[19:37:04] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/smashko/zu6aX/ someone else has the same problem with animating padding
[19:37:12] <veQue> works in ff not in chrome
[19:43:06] <coldhead> does it work when the padding isn't animated?
[19:43:24] <coldhead> i would guess it's something to do with the width of the parent(s) not being set
[19:45:24] <veQue> i'll set the width and see what happens

[20:01:04] <mfoxdogg|work> im going to ask again, how do i post a file field using ajax i do NOT want to upload, just post the file back, what i have http://jsfiddle.net/pVhKb/
[20:01:07] <garbagecollectio> dude if the hiring manager says 24 hours
[20:01:07] * tw2113 takes notes
[20:01:11] <garbagecollectio> says good luck at the end of the interview
[20:01:17] <garbagecollectio> its probably bad
[20:01:21] <garbagecollectio> and not responding to emails
[20:01:59] <coldhead> they seem more like the kind of company that is too busy to respond in time than they seem like the kind of company that will just blank you
[20:02:21] <garbagecollectio> right, about not getting it
[20:34:49] <hateIE> hey does any one know where i can find a tutorial to make weekly schedule that one can use to to extract the currently active appointment/entry so if the time(now) is between the the time slot the current day it will display who or what is in the time slot
[20:36:26] <hateIE> er this whacky keyboard! let me rephrase.. does any one know where i can find a tutorial to make A  weekly schedule that one can use to to extract the currently active appointment/entry so if the time(now) is between the current time slot OF the current day it will display who or what is in the time slot
[20:39:29] <sacho> you're unlikely to find a tutorial to make something so specific
[20:40:49] <donburks> Break it down into its component parts.
[20:41:00] <donburks> Find tutorials for those.
[20:41:01] <donburks> Though.
[20:41:11] <donburks> Once you break it into pieces, you'll probably find you don't need the tutorial so much anymore.
[20:41:19] <donburks> #justsayin
[20:56:34] <eip56> So im making an oject oriented script. In the object I have an 'init:' function that basically handles everything. Should I be chaining i calls to member functions or should each statement be only one call to one function?
[21:00:59] <ryanneufeld> donburks HI!!
[21:01:11] <donburks> ryanneufeld: Heya ;)
[21:01:32] <ryanneufeld> I think this is the first time I've seen you in here
[21:01:38] <donburks> No, just the first time in a while.
[21:01:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[21:02:32] <donburks> Had to hop on to talk to the UrbanAirship guys, and decided to lurk for a while out of a sense of nostalgia.
[21:02:35] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Burke?
[21:02:47] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: no, that's not him
[21:03:01] <donburks> Sadly, no. Neither Australian, nor that famous.
[21:03:20] <coldhead> well i won't hold that against you
[21:03:26] <coldhead> i'm not that much into gardening anyway
[21:04:45] <ryanneufeld> donburks is lurkingmore
[21:05:16] <donburks> I need to lurk more. Finally got a new IRC client, when XChat stb'ed.
[21:05:22] <ryanneufeld> limechat?
[21:07:15] <ryanneufeld> donburks: ^^
[21:07:23] <donburks> Yup.
[21:28:26] <MiracleBlue> Hey guys
[21:36:07] <hateIE> ok well I know i can make a table that represents the schedule / time table .. I can create a app to enter the cells in the time slots days being th's and time slots being the tds .. but then I need a code to iterate each day then each time slot.. I have already created a mysql db .. which i simple added tables from mon - sun then each slot 12 of them at 2 hours each I simply made a text field
[21:36:07] <hateIE> to contain a name/thing for that slot but its kind of hard :D i am suffering with extreme coders block and lazyitis at the moment
[21:45:16] <ryanneufeld> hateIE: lazytits or not, as donburks stated you need to break it down even further. There are methods like map and each you can use.
[21:55:40] <aqeel> hi room
[22:07:07] <dnyy> Is it not possible to close an iframe from within the iframe (not on same domain)? I've tried attaching a function to the parent window, but `parent` within the context of the iframe is a Window object with no properties. :/
[22:10:35] <donburks> If the iframe is not from your domain, you cannot cross the border. Same Origin Policy applies.
[22:10:41] <donburks> If you control the parent window, you can delete the iframe from the DOM.
[22:10:54] <donburks> Make sure the iframe has a specific ID.
[22:11:56] <dnyy> donburks: It's a bookmarklet, so It's not on the same domain, but the function is defined in a JS file that gets injected into the parent window. I guess that won't work? Not sure how other bookmarklets do it.
[22:12:22] <donburks> Into the parent window, yes, usually as a script tag.
[22:12:28] <donburks> But not from within an iframe?
[22:12:42] <dnyy> well, the parent window needs to know when to close it.
[22:13:38] <SmallCode> Hello everyone
[22:19:58] <JBlitzen> What's the difference between this channel and #jquery-dev?
[22:23:56] <aqeel> this channel use of jquery widely in html, #jquery-dev.....solely for advancement in jquery library itself
[22:28:23] <JBlitzen> Ahh, ty
[22:28:50] <jeremy-> I'm following the instructions as shown here: http://www.evensongraphics.co.nz/blog/2012/05/08/isotope-nextgen-gallery-template/ to add an isotope jquery gallery with filter to wordpress using nextgen gallery. I'm getting jquery errors which I believe is either script order or perhaps the safe mode jquery is running in. I have a demo up here: http://gravitymarketing.com.au/bodyvision/gallery/
[22:28:50] <jeremy-> I've done some googling and added jquery before the document ready declaration, however I'm not sure about if jquery needs to be added before any other function calls
[22:29:38] <SmallCode> Got an sql question, if anyone is good with mysql and can help me pm me
[22:29:47] <jeremy-> I believe the culprit is: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[22:35:55] <danheberden> jeremy-: jQuery does indeed need to be included on the page before you, you know, actually use it
[22:36:39] <jeremy-> Well i've inserted the code below other currently functional jquery scripts so i assumed that ruled out that possibility
[22:37:19] <jeremy-> When i said that I kind of meant other conflicts really but yes that is a dumb/obvious thing to say
[22:39:00] <SmallCode> hi
[22:39:17] <SmallCode> Is anyone familiar with mysql searching
[22:40:33] <coldhead> SmallCode: the people in ##mysql are obsessed with that stuff!
[22:41:18] <SmallCode> coldhead, it says cannot send to channel
[22:41:36] <coldhead> you probably have to register your nick with NickServ
[22:41:42] <coldhead> try /msg NickServ help
[22:43:21] <goddard> why isn't this working ? http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/
[22:43:24] <SmallCode> coldhead i registered
[22:43:48] <eip56> I am trying to fadeIn() a blacked out div dynamically. Why wouldn't $('div').fadeIn() not work. It will appear it just wont fade in?
[22:46:49] <jrockjiggz> what is blacked out? opacity: 0? display: none? off the screen? made the same color as the background? made really small?
[22:47:05] <jrockjiggz> i'll keep guessing
[22:47:31] <jrockjiggz> maybe visibility: hidden
[22:47:48] <eip56> No i think i have it figured out but thanks. I was trying to create a black overlay which i could do but jqueyr wouldnt fade in
[22:48:08] <eip56> basically would have to hide it first in would seem so i just created it in the dom then display: none till i need it
[22:48:11] <eip56> works just as well
[22:50:42] <goddard> i keep getting undefined
[22:54:25] <goddard> yo yo
[22:55:46] <goddard> calling all cars
[22:56:04] <goddard> weouweou weouweou
[22:59:13] <JBlitzen> Hang on goddard
[22:59:18] <donburks> goddard: Use .siblings('a').first() instead.
[23:00:11] <donburks> I would also put the actionid in a data attribute instead of just a plain attribute.
[23:00:15] <donburks> But that's just me.
[23:00:47] <goddard> whats a data attribute?
[23:02:19] <goddard> donburks: i tried that and it didn't work
[23:04:28] <donburks> goddard: $($(this).siblings()[0]).attr('actionid');
[23:04:31] <donburks> Ugly.
[23:04:33] <donburks> But it works.
[23:04:35] <donburks> Optimize from there.
[23:05:30] <goddard> how would i optimize it?
[23:06:03] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/3/
[23:06:09] <goddard> are you looking at this one?
[23:06:19] <donburks> Yes.
[23:06:31] <goddard> sorry
[23:06:34] <goddard> its different slightly
[23:06:49] <goddard> it maybe in a div or a span
[23:07:03] <donburks> What you have to ask yourself is what are you trying to accomplish? Do you just want the attribute from the next link? If so, just give that one an ID and call it directly, no need for the dom traversal.
[23:07:04] <goddard> i really just am trying to figure out a way to grab the closest link of that class no matter what
[23:07:10] <donburks> Ahh, okay.
[23:12:12] <goddard> is that more difficult would i have to do some kind of strange looping?
[23:12:44] <donburks> Nah.
[23:13:00] <donburks> Use .index() to find out where the pictureBox is in its container. Then get the children of the container and do index+1
[23:13:12] <JBlitzen> goddard
[23:13:13] <JBlitzen>             var testValue = $(this).nextAll('.activityID').attr('actionid');
[23:13:15] <JBlitzen> Try that
[23:13:28] <JBlitzen> Note that that's the first line of jquery I've ever written
[23:13:28] <donburks> Of course, if the link is before the pictureBox, neither what I said, or what JBlitzen said will work.
[23:13:47] <JBlitzen> nod, "closest" is kind of vague
[23:17:00] <goddard> like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/4/ it gives me undefined
[23:17:26] <goddard> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/5/
[23:20:03] <JBlitzen> You didn't have the img tag wrapped in an anchor tag before, goddard
[23:20:18] <donburks> Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
[23:20:26] <JBlitzen> Now that you have, you've got its scope isolated, so nextAll is looking for other elements within that anchor tag
[23:20:43] <JBlitzen> Either climb back out of that anchor tag, or remove it
[23:20:48] <goddard> oh ok
[23:21:09] <JBlitzen> But again, that was only my first line of jquery, so I'm pulling all this out of my ass
[23:21:15] <goddard> so basically i would need to either loop and keep passing along the parent tag till i find the next element of that class?
[23:21:28] <JBlitzen> Well
[23:21:41] <JBlitzen> It wasn't clear wtf you wanted.  If you want the next one in the entire file, hmm
[23:21:45] <JBlitzen> I'll have to look that up
[23:22:13] <goddard> yeah i figured thats what closest would do
[23:22:55] <donburks> Well, are the links /always/ going to be after the image?
[23:23:15] <jrockjiggz> goddard: http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/6/
[23:23:43] <donburks> That doesn't get him the closest one though.
[23:28:53] <JBlitzen> It's not clear to me that you can do that with jquery, goddard
[23:29:03] <JBlitzen> Not without any knowledge whatsoever of the parent structure
[23:30:10] <donburks> Yes, you can, it's just cumbersome. And that's not jQuery's fault.
[23:30:49] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/pxu8j/
[23:30:52] <JBlitzen> goddard ^
[23:31:04] <JBlitzen> parent().parent(). to break out of the img and then out of the a, I presume
[23:31:13] <JBlitzen> Or out of the a and then out of whatever the a is inside of
[23:31:26] <donburks> Well, if you knew the parent structure, you would do .parents('.selector')
[23:31:33] <donburks> And that would climb the chain until that point.
[23:31:43] <donburks> But .siblings('.activityID') would get you all the ones in the same container.
[23:31:48] <donburks> And then you could pick one from there.
[23:31:53] <JBlitzen> Problem is they aren't in the same container
[23:33:15] <jrockjiggz> goddard: my solution: http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/11/
[23:38:03] <ItsJustMe> Good morning :)
[23:50:05] <ItsJustMe> I need to tell jquery that price-month is price-month and not price less month .. How to do that? :)
[23:51:29] <ItsJustMe> nvm .. no patience for waiting this morning :D
[23:51:39] <ItsJustMe> I will just change it to price_month
[23:52:35] <zhulikas> wtf is price less month?
[23:52:41] <zhulikas> price < month?
[23:53:26] <donburks> Price minus month
[23:54:11] <zhulikas> are those two number variables?
[23:56:09] <ItsJustMe> donburks is right zuhulikas .. :)
[23:56:21] <ItsJustMe> zhulikas*
