[00:19:00] <nucc1> Hi guys, i've got a simple jquery function to load a url into a div. the content gets retrieved fine, but the div is set blank instead by jquery. The site is at : http://ssldumpviewer.com and a sample text file is here: http://nucco.org/files/aj.txt . Appreciate if anyone has any clue what's going wrong.
[00:55:27] <TheJHNZ> for some reason using opacity laggs using the animate() function ?
[01:07:35] <TheJHNZ> does using find('*') affect anything?
[01:13:24] <seutje> TheJHNZ: grabs all descendant elements separately in a collection
[01:14:16] <seutje> like if you did this on a <ul><li><a>lol</a></li></ul> $('ul').find('*'); would return a collection with [0] being the LI and [1] being the A
[01:15:11] <erickl_s> R)
[01:15:15] <TheJHNZ> would it cause any performance issues?
[01:15:34] <TheJHNZ> im having some trouble with my script on ios using animate
[01:16:02] <TheJHNZ> could you take a look and see if you can spot anything that would be causing it? http://203.86.203.162:8080/gitdev/mepo/application/public/js/global.js
[01:17:22] <TheJHNZ> its like stuttering
[01:18:13] <seutje> $(document).ready(function() {}); and $(function(){}); are essentially the same
[01:18:32] <seutje> so ur just wrapping them in eachother, not very useful, but that shouldn't cause any real problems
[01:19:08] <seutje> that label click handler is native behavior, no?
[01:19:25] <seutje> xcept native behavior throws focus and not an arbitrary click
[01:19:55] <TheJHNZ> its the reg-footer a, label
[01:19:57] <TheJHNZ> which is being used
[01:20:08] <seutje> also, you don't want to be defining the slide function inside the click handler
[01:20:19] <seutje> it'll effectively be redefined every time you click
[01:20:45] <seutje> there's no need for it to change in between clicks, so you could just put in a higher scope
[01:21:43] <TheJHNZ> ahh alright
[01:21:58] <seutje> now there are a lot of problems with getting setTimeout based animations smooth on some devices
[01:22:16] <TheJHNZ> so put the slide function inside the document ready ?
[01:22:17] <seutje> and I'm not sure you'll be able to get it as smooth as desired going about it this way
[01:22:25] <seutje> sure
[01:23:27] <TheJHNZ> alright done that
[01:23:38] <TheJHNZ> lets check the performance now
[01:23:52] <TheJHNZ> didnt change
[01:23:52] <TheJHNZ> hmm
[01:24:15] <TheJHNZ> it was smooth and i had just the slide going
[01:25:25] <TheJHNZ> i closed some stuff in ios and its way better lol
[01:26:57] <TheJHNZ> so much better
[01:27:03] <TheJHNZ> it must of just been crappy apple
[01:27:03] <TheJHNZ> lol
[01:30:46] <seutje> it'll be similar on other devices
[01:31:13] <seutje> basically you have 2 options, have accurate steps or have accurate beginning/end
[01:31:44] <seutje> both is really hard, and if we're talking non-essential fluff, it's prolly not worth the time
[01:35:16] <nucc1> turns out to be a stray space in the URL (not visible to the naked eye, but solved with a trim() )
[01:39:06] <ck123> hi
[01:40:36] <ck123> hey anbody there to save me
[02:06:18] <TheJHNZ> whats an easy way to wait for something to complete then do something else ?
[02:10:59] <Clex> TheJHNZ: to emit an event once the first thing is over.
[02:11:28] <TheJHNZ> not sure how i would do that
[02:11:48] <TheJHNZ> http://pastebin.com/kQw9U5x5
[02:11:53] <TheJHNZ> i have this code
[02:12:06] <TheJHNZ> but it doesnt seem to animate the next slide
[02:12:12] <TheJHNZ> well
[02:12:17] <TheJHNZ> it doesnt seem to do the animation
[02:12:48] <TheJHNZ> oh wait.. it's not actually changing anything
[02:23:12] <faianca> Morning
[03:18:34] <mehrdad> hello
[03:19:31] <mehrdad> i need to display a ui-icon on a dynamically generated element. how can i do that?
[03:20:11] <mehrdad> since the element is dynamically generated, applying the ui-icon-* class doesn't work.
[03:58:30] <grafi> hm?
[04:14:14] <corv> Hey everynone
[04:14:57] <corv> anyone knows any client side encryption that wont be hacked easily?
[04:15:52] <SyntheCypher> How do I detect what platform/os my page is currently displaying on?
[04:16:34] <Asmooh> force the user to select a option?
[04:16:35] <corv> navigator.userAgent
[04:16:53] <corv> SyntheCypher -> navigator.userAgent
[04:17:23] <SyntheCypher> but that's a really long string
[04:17:27] <SyntheCypher> I just want like
[04:17:29] <SyntheCypher> Android
[04:17:30] <SyntheCypher> iOS
[04:17:32] <SyntheCypher> Windows
[04:17:38] <SyntheCypher> Mac
[04:17:52] <Asmooh> and you think that those are the only plaforms?
[04:17:54] <Asmooh> pfff
[04:18:03] <SyntheCypher> well
[04:18:05] <SyntheCypher> you know
[04:18:08] <SyntheCypher> ...
[04:18:09] <SyntheCypher> etc.
[04:18:38] <Asmooh> or just do: if the screen is lower than 720p, force the user to buy a real phone/device
[04:18:39] <Asmooh> ;P
[04:18:59] <SyntheCypher> that's not really the point
[04:19:02] <SyntheCypher> I'm using weinre
[04:19:23] <SyntheCypher> and I want to seperate my debugging using a platform string
[04:27:26] <motaka2> why in this peace of code http://paste.ubuntu.com/6702884/ on line 4 we need to pass anew object so the inheritence would work ?
[04:30:56] <motaka2> Why do we need SubClass.prototype = new(ParentClass.prototype) and why  SubClass.prototype = ParentClass.prototype alone is not correct?
[04:33:33] <grafi> who is we, what is that, maybe you should ask in ##javascript ?
[04:34:37] <motaka2> grafi: :)
[04:35:18] <TheJHNZ> http://joshua.geek.nz/s/DERP01-07-01-34-09.png
[04:35:23] <TheJHNZ> getting this ghosting bug in ff
[04:35:29] <TheJHNZ> when using animate
[04:35:56] <grafi> impressive
[04:36:21] <TheJHNZ> huh
[04:36:22] <TheJHNZ> lol
[05:18:26] <malinens> what is the name of event when i select value for input field not by typing but by selecting previously typed value? (browser remembers what I typed there and provides dropdown of prevously writen values)
[05:20:36] <AdamPDotty> should still be change
[06:02:41] <NBhosting> anyone some experiance with jquery mobie css
[06:02:54] <NBhosting> my default css classes dont seem to work within jquery mobile
[06:04:37] <sanchit> well you can always hit F12 and see which things are conflicting.
[06:05:07] <sanchit> also with mobile just try and have one css/js class if possible
[06:05:24] <sanchit> as it loads all new pages as transitions with ajax = no new css/js unless you do it correctly.
[06:05:49] <NBhosting> i think its somehow not picking up my css because the class needs to be surrounded bij de mobie class or something
[06:06:27] <sanchit> well if your css is incorrect then it won't work either :P
[06:06:39] <sanchit> so give it that class or whatever and try again.
[06:07:42] <NBhosting> i have something like   #dothisondiv { background:#ff0000;}   but when i put the class on the div inside the jquery mobiel page/content  i wont do it
[06:07:58] <NBhosting> <div id="blok1" class="blok2">
[06:08:00] <NBhosting> wont work
[06:09:18] <NBhosting> if i manual put a style="" on it, it works fine
[06:11:32] <sanchit> "#" isnt a class, that is ID   "." is a class
[06:12:06] <NBhosting> trief both
[06:12:09] <NBhosting> tried
[06:12:47] <NBhosting> also tried to set  data-role="none"
[06:12:51] <NBhosting> on those divs
[06:13:12] <sanchit> give a sample page with code maybe? You're obviously doing somethign super simple wrong.
[06:13:23] <sanchit> wehre is this css file located? Are you calling it?
[06:13:38] <NBhosting> ill make a short dpaste 1 sec
[06:13:50] <sanchit> yep yep. ez
[06:15:03] <NBhosting> https://dpaste.de/3NCA
[06:15:35] <NBhosting> fro example: <div class="ruimte"><label class="profinfo">Ogen: </label>Bruin</div>
[06:15:49] <NBhosting> those doesnt get called inside the jquery content
[06:15:55] <NBhosting> outside it works fine
[06:16:43] <NBhosting> looks like its just ignoring the class or id totaly
[06:17:59] <NBhosting> i think it wants my class in a namespace or something like that?
[06:23:13] <sanchit> Maybe it doesnt like the fact that it isnt actually a css file? "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/profielen/callcss/" >"
[06:30:07] <NBhosting> k let me try
[06:30:35] <NBhosting> that works fine in normal browser do
[06:32:41] <NBhosting> no difrance <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/profielen/callcss.css">
[06:35:04] <NBhosting> could also be the page theming that doesnt like what im doing
[06:35:32] <NBhosting> in the jquery css they do this alot
[06:35:33] <NBhosting> html .ui-bar-c
[06:35:33] <sanchit> Your paste is ilke too complicated. I really doubt its a complicated problem. Try putting your relevant css in the head in a script tag vs that file maybe.
[06:35:38] <NBhosting> html before every class
[06:35:41] <sanchit> do you use conflicting stuff?
[06:35:54] <NBhosting> k ill trt
[06:35:56] <NBhosting> try
[06:35:59] <sanchit> files only load once. you cant load different "head" sections over different pages in jquery
[06:36:02] <sanchit> unless you do it right
[06:36:10] <sanchit> you only reload "body" sections on page transitions
[06:36:57] <NBhosting> mm idd, when i put it manualy in there it does work
[06:37:44] <NBhosting> maybe try some other ways to load <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/profielen/callcss.css">
[06:37:57] <NBhosting> not sure if we can try something else there
[06:41:47] <Nescafe_> hi guys, I having a problem with my option selected to show hidden div --> http://jsfiddle.net/ZUBkB/
[06:42:14] <Nescafe_> may I know where did I get wrong? why my option custom wasn't show even the option selected custom is made
[07:11:47] <BillCriswell> Nescafe_: I think it's just the way you're trying to grab the option. http://jsfiddle.net/ZUBkB/1/ works
[07:12:41] <NBhosting> @import "newstyles.css"; could work
[07:13:35] <BillCriswell> Nescafe_: Duh. Also you probably wanted $('#optionpicker option:selected').val(), not $('#optionpicker option:selected').text(). $('#optionpicker option:selected').text() === 'Custom' not === 'custom'
[07:21:50] <Nescafe_> BillCriswell, ahh thank you so much, I followed the tutorial wrongly haha
[07:22:11] <Nescafe_> thanks for the markup and advise, will avoid the same mistake in future :)
[07:23:56] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:24:41] <Nescafe_> BillCriswell, ahh, my jquery ui datepicker not showing, is it because of the script?
[07:24:57] <Nescafe_> if you see this line <div id="datepicker"></div><br />
[07:25:07] <Nescafe_> actually it's the line to call the datepicker
[07:26:08] <BillCriswell> I don't see anything about the date picker in the fiddle.
[07:26:18] <BillCriswell> JS wise, at least.
[07:26:31] <Nescafe_> BillCrisswell, here updated the code with datepicker --> http://jsfiddle.net/ZUBkB/3/
[07:26:48] <Nescafe_> i remove out the display: none; so you can see it
[07:28:30] <BillCriswell> Nescafe_: What's your goal here?
[07:29:18] <Nescafe_> BillCriswell, to display the <div></div> that contain the jquery datepicker and input field if "custom" option selected else it's hidden
[07:29:46] <BillCriswell> Nescafe_: I never seen the date picker used that way.
[07:30:08] <Nescafe_> opps...
[07:30:29] <seutje> Nescafe_: $('div').hide();
[07:30:32] <seutje> ur hiding ALL divs
[07:30:35] <BillCriswell> Nescafe_: http://jsfiddle.net/ZUBkB/4/ Were you shooting for this?
[07:30:36] <Nescafe_> because the current option I don't want to confuse the user either they should key in the date or select the option
[07:30:41] <seutje> and then you show a parent, but the children are still hidden
[07:31:43] <seutje> $('div').hide(); includes <div id="datepicker">
[07:32:04] <Nescafe_> BillCriswell, yes but with the datepicker show as well
[07:32:25] <BillCriswell> What's the deal with hacker news being down. I want to find some code golf to do while I work haha.
[07:32:30] <seutje> Nescafe_: http://jsfiddle.net/ZUBkB/5/
[07:32:45] <Nescafe_> ouch, so possible to put the <div id="datepicker"></div> not to be hidden?
[07:33:10] <BillCriswell> I'm glad someone else knew what the goal was.
[07:33:17] <seutje> I'm just guessing
[07:33:29] <Nescafe_> seutje ahhh!! thanks man!! that save my life again
[07:33:33] <seutje> but I'm also guessing the from/to is much easier with the built in API options: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range
[07:33:51] <BillCriswell> I need to play with jQuery UI more.
[07:33:58] <seutje> then at least ur instanciating it on a input instead of a DIV
[07:33:58] <Nescafe_> now I understand if only $('div') it will hide all div tag
[07:34:02] <BillCriswell> I used draggable and droppable recently, that was a good time.
[07:34:03] <seutje> yes
[07:34:29] <seutje> I like their new z-index stacking mechanism
[07:37:06] <BillCriswell> That does sound fancy.
[07:37:37] <BillCriswell> I have the Pete & Pete theme song stuck in my head.
[07:38:38] <seutje> http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/stacking-elements/
[07:42:53] <BillCriswell> seutje: That took me way longer to understand than it should have.
[07:45:03] <seutje> BillCriswell: oh lol, never actually read that page, figured it out from sauce
[07:45:16] <seutje> although I'm not sure that makes it easier
[07:46:53] <BillCriswell> seutje: I rarely run into trouble with z-index. When I do I'm usually doing something dumb, though.
[07:47:48] <seutje> BillCriswell: yeah, me neither, but it's nice to have something manage it without having components that have to know about the other's z-index
[07:48:28] <BillCriswell> True.
[07:51:46] <digifiv5e> [Q]: How do i inject working jquery via appendTo? (I'm adding repeatable input fields with new id number and require a datepicker to be added for each new field)
[07:54:10] <drager> So I'm creating and moving new elements (abit to the bottom and to the left) https://dpaste.de/K86w  in another element but when I'm coming to the "end" of the parent element it should "start over" so it doesn't have a position outside of the parent element. Ideas?
[08:02:53] <sdwrage> Hey all. I have three divs with links inside. They don't actually go anywhere but when I click each one I will assign a class to them called "selected". What is the best way to check all three divs to see if there is at least one selected from each and then fire a function if so?
[08:03:13] <digifiv5e> Anyone know how to append jquery to a div using jquery?
[08:07:21] <BillCriswell> Web development is so weird... you can spend days on something and it'll seem like nothing then minutes on something and it'll seem like days worth of work.
[08:07:43] <ujkaaa> hi need a little help
[08:07:56] <ujkaaa> need horizontal slider
[08:08:22] <sdwrage> BillCriswell, guessing that it has something to do with how enjoyable that particular piece of code is
[08:08:31] <ujkaaa> i've found a lot of tuts but no one is good
[08:10:32] <drager> So I'm creating and moving new elements (abit to the bottom and to the left) https://dpaste.de/K86w  in another element but when I'm coming to the "end" of the parent element it should "start over" so it doesn't have a position outside of the parent element. Ideas?
[08:10:39] <BillCriswell> ujkaaa: Horizontal slider would be as easy as overflow: auto. What's your issue?
[08:11:17] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: Agreed.
[08:11:53] <ujkaaa> BillCriswell i am new in jquery :), but i found this tuts: http://www.htmldrive.net/items/demo/966/jQuery-Horizontal-automatic-Scrollbars-with-mouse
[08:12:18] <ujkaaa> i want to make smaller slider
[08:13:32] <BillCriswell> drager: When you say "start over" do you mean add to the next line
[08:13:32] <BillCriswell> ?
[08:13:38] <BillCriswell> go to the next line(
[08:14:02] <sdwrage> if i go to select an element from a div and it doesn't exist, I get nil correct>
[08:14:03] <sdwrage> ?
[08:14:34] <drager> BillCriswell: I mean like, start over from "top set to 0" but move it away
[08:14:40] <drager> to the left or something
[08:14:42] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: An empty object.
[08:15:13] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: You'd have to check the length if you want something truth/falsy.
[08:15:28] <digifiv5e> Anyone know how to append jquery to a div using jquery?
[08:15:30] <sdwrage> BillCriswell, so if returnedobj.length > 0?
[08:15:43] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: Yeah.
[08:15:45] <sdwrage> okay
[08:15:46] <sdwrage> good
[08:16:19] <BillCriswell> drager: I'm having a hard time following what you're going for.
[08:18:25] <drager> BillCriswell: I want to create elements (like a window with content) and when I'm creating it I move it like this; $(this).css({ 'left': 40 * i + 'px', 'top': 10 * i + 'px'}); and when it create an element and moves it and if it's left or top position is larger or equal to the width of the parent element I would like to set the top to 0 and the left or right to someting?
[08:24:08] <jsc802> hi
[08:24:29] <jsc802> i have this selector $('#poochy input[type="image"]').on('click',function(){
[08:24:40] <jsc802> but i want $(this) to refer to the #poochy container
[08:24:52] <jsc802> what is the best way to do this?
[08:26:23] <drager> BillCriswell: You didn't follow now either?=
[08:27:52] <jedimind> drager why arent you using css3 transitions for that ?
[08:28:17] <jsc802> anyone?
[08:28:52] <drager> jedimind: For moving dynamically created elements?
[08:29:15] <jedimind> sure
[08:35:28] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm having a strange issue with a slider, for some reason before the page is loaded I first see for a couple seconds the images stacked above each other, I've tried to debug this going through the JS custom code but nothing helps, any ideas?
[08:38:34] <digifiv5e> sunbeam, because the jquery isn't applied to the images when they init
[08:40:18] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: yes, but why the delay? I Mean a few ms would be fine
[08:40:21] <sunbeam> but why 1 second
[08:40:40] <digifiv5e> check the net console to see how long it takes to load the images
[08:40:45] <digifiv5e> and the rest of the page
[08:41:06] <digifiv5e> i'm thinking the jquery is being executed on document.ready
[08:41:15] <digifiv5e> (so it loads at the very last)
[08:41:23] <usc911> Hey guys, I have a bit of an issue when creating a button and appending it that is doesnt seem to work, if I pull it outside of the generated code it works fine, anyone shed any light please? https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/dbdfeafaf649ad894852
[08:41:48] <digifiv5e> sunbeam, you could hide the images initially via css and then remove that declaration via jquery when the page is completely loaded
[08:42:24] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: yep, thats what I thought, sec
[08:49:35] <sdwrage> Hey guys. I have a click event on links in a div, how do I check what content is inside of the link?
[08:50:05] <sdwrage> meaning, if I have <a href="#">this stuff here</a> how do I get "this stuff here"
[08:50:27] <NoiseEee> jQueriedReferenceToA.html()
[08:54:15] <digifiv5e> sdwrage, $('#mylink').text(); perhaps (or even .html
[08:54:15] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: what should I set on them?
[08:54:21] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: what CSS
[08:54:22] <digifiv5e> http://api.jquery.com/text/
[08:54:42] <sdwrage> digifiv5e, I need to fetch it inside of the callback function for an event
[08:55:05] <digifiv5e> sunbeam, css, either display none or visibility hidden
[08:56:24] <sdwrage> getting this when I alert $(this).text
[08:56:26] <sdwrage> function (e){return x.access(this,function(e){return e===t?x.text(this):this.empty().append((this[0]&&this[0].ownerDocument||a).createTextNode(e))},null,e,arguments.length)}
[08:58:47] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: doesn't change anything
[08:59:00] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: even when I add display: none !important; visibility: hidden !important
[08:59:20] <sunbeam> digifiv5e: ohh
[08:59:34] <sunbeam> cause of the type of page there are no <img> but background images of each <li>
[09:00:26] <digifiv5e> sdwrage, it should be relatively simple as it just returns a value http://jsfiddle.net/4fvgP/
[09:01:07] <digifiv5e> sunbeam, if it's a bg image, you can apply that css to the div rather than the image tag
[09:01:19] <digifiv5e> or li i mean
[09:02:52] <sunbeam> yea
[09:03:00] <sdwrage> digifiv5e, I am using an event so I don't know what element it might be
[09:03:16] <sdwrage> I want, when I click, to get the content of the element I clicked
[09:03:22] <sdwrage> there is no id or class on it
[09:03:26] <joro> use
[09:03:30] <joro> evt.target
[09:04:17] <joro> but how do you attach an event to it if you don't have class/id?
[09:04:39] <sdwrage> moro, yep it was $(event.target).html();
[09:05:01] <sdwrage> joro, $(.nav a).click(function() {}
[09:05:14] <sdwrage> I had a parent but I needed the a element
[09:05:16] <joro> ih
[09:05:17] <joro> oh
[09:05:21] <joro> so e.target
[09:05:27] <sdwrage> event target was fine
[09:05:29] <sdwrage> :P
[09:05:32] <joro> a contains text only?
[09:05:36] <sdwrage> yeah
[09:05:36] <joro> 'a'?
[09:05:41] <joro> so just do
[09:05:47] <sdwrage> no worries man it worked
[09:05:48] <joro> e.target.textContent
[09:05:49] <sdwrage> lol
[09:05:53] <sdwrage> :P
[09:06:01] <joro> it's faster
[09:06:03] <sdwrage> okay
[09:06:12] <joro> but will work with ie9+ so if not...
[09:06:48] <sdwrage> textContent doesn't work in ie8>
[09:06:49] <sdwrage> ?
[09:07:52] <joro> 8 or 9 not sure
[09:08:08] <joro> 9 works , i'm not sure about 8
[09:09:38] <joro> yea it's not 9 and above
[09:24:27] <davidw> hi - I'm using the lightness jquery-ui via rails, and it's not showing the little X in the corner.  Does this ring any bells off hand? I'm not seeing errors in the console, and everything else seems ok
[09:34:20] <wa5ted> could that x be associated with a close button davidw
[09:34:26] <wa5ted> just guessing here
[09:34:38] <digifiv5e> davidw, no 404 or anything? is it supposed to have an X? some are designed with no X and to just click outside the box
[09:35:00] <davidw> digifiv5e, it's supposed to have an X - I checked the themes  on jquery-ui
[09:35:05] <davidw> it had an X before
[09:35:22] <davidw> something in all these assets and gems and whatknot has broken it, sllightly, it would seem...sigh
[09:37:54] <digifiv5e> davidw, so it's all working except the little x?
[09:38:31] <davidw> digifiv5e, as far as I can tell, yes
[09:39:50] <digifiv5e> davidw, send me a link to the library? (I'm guessing you're working locally since it's rails)
[09:43:35] <davidw> digifiv5e, let's see, I've got jquery-ui-rails, jquery-rails and jquery-ui-themes as gems, all updated to recent versions 4.1.1, 2.3.0, 0.0.11
[09:45:47] <digifiv5e> davidw, and you've added the proper "require" to load these into your app?
[09:46:04] <digifiv5e> like "require jquery.ui.all"
[09:46:20] <digifiv5e> (not sure if that's the actual, just an example)
[09:46:33] <davidw> digifiv5e, yeah, I have that and require jquery-ui/ui-lightness
[09:48:38] <subsonic> I'm using .sortable(), I'm changing elements dynamicaly and need to re-run sortable() on them.  What's the best way to do that?
[09:52:31] <BillCriswell> subsonic: What are you changing about the element?
[09:58:01] <subsonic> BillCriswell: Adding, removing
[09:58:33] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhh
[09:59:00] <subsonic> refresh doesn't seem to be fixiing it
[09:59:28] <subsonic> it works if I just re-run sortable on the entire thing.
[09:59:54] <subsonic> it could be like a strange issue between canjs and sortable
[10:00:48] <BillCriswell> subsonic: Hmm.. wonder why refresh isn't working.
[10:01:16] <darkfrog> if I have a selector (ie: $('.someclass')) and I want to create an Array of the ids from the selector, what would be the most efficient way to write that?
[10:01:37] <darkfrog> I can do crappy string concatenation, but I'm hoping for a "map" style function?
[10:01:44] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: I would use map.
[10:01:59] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('id'); }).get();
[10:02:11] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: ah, nice, thanks! :)
[10:04:15] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: No problem.
[10:07:36] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[10:07:57] <sdwrage> is there a decent way to iterate through json and build out some html to populate with json data?
[10:08:11] <sdwrage> other than a heck of a lot of string concats in my js file
[10:09:24] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: I'll use an array if I don't have underscore or something with a template function of some sort.
[10:11:02] <sdwrage> BillCriswell, I do have an array of json objects... so I will, in the end, have to still write my html and concat with json object properties?
[10:11:49] <sdwrage> aka '<li>' + currentobj.name + "<br /><p>" + currentobj.info + "</p></li>"
[10:11:50] <sdwrage> ?
[10:13:32] <BillCriswell> That's as good as it gets with plain JS.
[10:14:45] <BillCriswell> sdwrage: If you're using underscore you can do like _.template('<li><%= name %><br><p><%= info %></p></li>', currentObj);
[10:16:30] <BillCriswell> http://underscorejs.org/#template
[10:17:50] <BillCriswell> http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/ might also interest you if you don't want to use all of underscore.
[10:42:42] <jimi_> For mobile browsers like safari, how can I detect "idle" ness on a page
[10:42:58] <duch_kazatel> "idle" ness defined as...?
[10:43:39] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, no movement, no clicks, no scrolling, nothing
[10:44:50] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ you'd likely have to hook into various interaction events and manually set a timer.
[10:44:58] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to accomplish?
[10:45:27] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, log a mobile user out and redirect on idleness... like sitting on one page for greater than N minutes
[10:46:09] <duch_kazatel> i'd just do what most banks do - base it on when the page was loaded.
[10:49:05] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, mind blond, didnt even think of that, thats perfect.
[10:49:17] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, even if they are actively scrolling the page, fuck it, shoulda clicked something :P
[10:51:07] <mrchris> I have a selector that runs extremely slow on Chrome as soon as the number of checkboxes gets around the 600 mark. It runs fairly quick on firefox.  Are there any obvious things I can do to speed it up?   Here's the code : https://gist.github.com/cmrichards/a05fb2a0ba898e1a8f6e
[10:51:55] <duch_kazatel> mrchris $("tr#"+row+" input[type=checkbox]").each(function(index, checkbox) - that's your problem./
[10:52:17] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: how can it be made quicker?
[10:52:27] <duch_kazatel> mrchris jquery's .each() iterator is slow.
[10:52:57] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: what would be a better way?
[10:53:32] <duch_kazatel> well, first of all that tr is completely unncessary.
[10:53:34] <duch_kazatel> so remove that.
[10:54:19] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: I need to loop through X number of rows after a specific row.
[10:54:42] <duch_kazatel> try splitting it into something like this: $currentRow = $("#"+row); currentCheckBox = $currentRow.find("input[type=checkbox]");
[10:54:53] <duch_kazatel> basically, reduce the amound of lookups.
[10:55:35] <maxmoore14> anyone know the expected drop date for the JQM upgrade guide? http://jquerymobile.com/upgrade-guide/1.4/
[10:56:37] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: thanks! that made a huge difference
[10:56:39] <duch_kazatel> mrchris part of the problem is that selector is going to be sloooooow no matter what. input[type=checkbox] is expensive.  can you attach a class to those checkboxes?
[10:56:52] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: yes there is a class...
[10:57:01] <duch_kazatel> then why not target that class instead?
[10:57:05] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: i will
[10:57:24] <mrchris> duch_kazatel:  so is input[type=checkbox].class_name better than input.class_name ?
[10:57:35] <shoky> mrchris: also you're searching in an array of IDs. that's a linear-time search for each checkbox of each row. test_ids should be an object with the ids as keys, and use "in" operator instead of $.inArray
[10:57:36] <duch_kazatel> no, input.class_name is better.
[10:58:01] <duch_kazatel> you want to avoid the square-brackets whenever possible.
[10:59:48] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: ok thanks a lot.  that should help.  I need to go now, wife is calling me home
[10:59:50] <mrchris> shoky: thanks
[10:59:56] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, avoid the jquery iterators.  those are expensive.  .each(), .inArray(), etc.
[11:00:10] <duch_kazatel> enjoy cap'n
[11:00:47] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: cap
[11:00:50] <mrchris> duch_kazatel: cap'n?
[11:01:07] <duch_kazatel> i call people "captain", or "cap'n" for short.
[11:05:03] <GoSox> is there an 'easy' way to iterate through every item of a class? Like if I have ten DIVs of class "fish", and I want do go through all 10 and perform some functions on them
[11:05:33] <jphase> GoSox: $('.fish').each(function(){ console.log($(this)); });
[11:09:39] <GoSox> wow it's so easy it's almost scary
[11:09:39] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: you should add kipt'n to your vocabulary, like chekov
[11:12:43] <GoSox> Does anyone have an opinion on using "..." vs "&hellip;"
[11:15:25] <duch_kazatel> GoSox one is a single char, the other is three.
[11:15:33] <GoSox> i know
[11:15:49] <GoSox> ok so, does anyone have an opinion on their usage
[11:16:02] <duch_kazatel> i know that the single char version renders kinda funny on windows to me, but that's personal taste.
[11:16:03] <jphase> one has adorable dots close together, other is spacey?
[11:16:17] <jphase> I don't use hellip personally
[11:16:36] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[11:32:17] <GoSox> does $(this) change if you put it in the callback of a $.post() call?
[11:33:07] <shoky> yea. "this" changes in any callback
[11:39:42] <maxmoore14> anyone know the expected drop date for the JQM upgrade guide? http://jquerymobile.com/upgrade-guide/1.4/
[11:46:32] <jonez> greetings. I need to replace everything in my document (including the <?xml before the html tag. is there a way to do this? I tried $("html").html = "this is a test" but that does not work (still shows original page)
[11:47:15] <jonez> I'm not sure what to google for
[11:47:27] <joro> got an example code?
[11:47:30] <BinaryKitten> jonez see other channel?
[11:47:56] <jonez> BinaryKitten, ok
[11:48:42] <GoSox> sooo i thought that javascript inside the $(function() {} ); didn't execute until after the page loaded?
[11:49:10] <BinaryKitten> mostly
[11:49:18] <BinaryKitten> GoSox it's document.ready
[11:49:22] <BinaryKitten> which is close
[11:49:45] <GoSox> i have a little app i'm working on, and i do some non-async ajax calls, but these start going before the page renders, so the page doesn't render until all of the commands are done, which defeats the whole purpose of doing jquery and fancy animation
[11:49:58] <GoSox> i could have just built the whole thing in php if i was going to operate this way
[11:51:05] <programmerpanda> Heyo!
[11:52:14] <joro> oye
[11:53:56] <programmerpanda> http://jsfiddle.net/JVb8X/
[11:54:08] <programmerpanda> I'm attempting to make it so all my pages load via ajax.
[11:54:33] <programmerpanda> just replacing the #content section on the pages.
[11:58:11] <GoSox> i'm trying to make a series of http calls, and 'process' the results of each call, one at a time
[11:59:26] <GoSox> if i use async calls, every potential request is initiated all at once, and they just take a long time to run, as browsers only do 4 http calls at one time. If I use sync calls, the whole page freezes until every request is finished, then the page loads, as if i had done the entire thing server-side
[12:01:18] <GoSox> is there some way to pause the parent function, until i tell it to resume from within the callback of an .ajax() call, but with the call still done asynchronously?
[12:02:59] <NoiseEee> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/ @ GoSox
[12:05:53] <programmerpanda> any help on my issue ?
[12:20:06] <NoiseEee> programmerpanda: you should be loading content, not a new page.  otherwise you get multiple <html>, <body> etc etc
[12:20:52] <shoky> he is. he just didn't say what the issue is
[12:21:19] <GoSox> the issue is that no one can link to pages on his site, since they're all one page
[12:21:28] <GoSox> unless he uses that history editing function
[12:21:58] <BillCriswell> I hate websites.
[12:29:19] <alaing> hi, i'm trying to clone th and insert them in mutliple places in my table. http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/xEwDi
[12:29:39] <alaing> however it only seems to output it at the end of the table
[12:29:48] <alaing> any ideas?
[12:32:08] <alaing> just updated that demo
[12:32:10] <alaing> http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/xEwDi
[12:32:32] <alaing> to show what I'm trying to dynamically build
[12:33:07] <Scott0_> what's the best way to get a video displayed overlayed on the first page loaded from a website?
[12:33:38] <maxmoore14> anyone know the expected drop date for the JQM upgrade guide? http://jquerymobile.com/upgrade-guide/1.4/
[12:33:39] <Scott0_> im guessing that just a lightbox of some kind
[12:35:49] <alaing> Scott0_: are you using jquery ui?
[12:36:15] <Scott0_> ill use what I have to
[12:36:23] <Scott0_> and im thinking about using vimeo or youtube
[12:36:36] <Scott0_> leaning towards vimeo because I like their player
[12:37:09] <alaing> Scott0_: am i right in thinking you want like a promo video that overlayes the first page
[12:37:26] <Scott0_> its an informational video
[12:37:31] <Scott0_> but yet for as short time
[12:37:34] <alaing> Ah ok
[12:38:14] <alaing> lightbox woudl work but jquery ui also work
[12:38:48] <alaing> jquery ui has dialog box which allows you to pass it a url
[12:39:01] <alaing> and it will load in the content
[12:40:12] <alaing> Scott0_: take it you not lookin to host this video yourselve
[12:40:39] <Scott0_> nope
[12:41:07] <alaing> Scott0_: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal
[12:42:24] <alaing> hi, i'm trying to clone th and insert them in mutliple places in my table. http://codepen.io/aliuk12/pen/xEwDi
[12:45:14] <shoky> alaing: you have to clone it each time
[12:47:33] <alaing> ah, is that because I'm just refering to the same cached selection. So I need to clone $heading each time
[12:48:00] <shoky> yeah
[12:48:23] <alaing> shoky: doh!! completely forgot about that. Thanks working perfectly
[12:49:20] <alaing> thanks shoky
[12:49:43] <alaing> Scott0_: hope you manage to come right with your video
[12:50:14] <alaing> I need to head off for bed, got a really long day ahead tomorrow.
[12:53:58] <Cyclohexane> I have something where when you click a tr it triggers a checkbox click inside of that tr, but it seems that the checkbox click triggers the tr.. how would I get around this?
[12:55:25] <shoky> don't trigger a click on the checkbox, just change its checked property. or - in the checkbox click event handler call event.stopPropagation() on the event argument
[12:57:44] <Cyclohexane> shoky: the thing is the checkbox in this library seems to be a <div> made to look like a checkbox lol
[12:58:16] <shoky> still, triggering clicks is evil if the intention is just to run a function
[12:59:04] <shoky> anyway.. stopPropagation will stop it bubbling up to the tr
[13:02:02] <BillCriswell> I just tried to do something in Drupal and it actually sort of worked.
[13:02:14] <BillCriswell> This may be my biggest accomplishment on a computer.
[13:10:58] <shoky> heh
[13:12:34] <BillCriswell> shoky: Baby steps.
[13:53:03] <ProfElm> Hey guys, I have a question. Is there a way that I can use a selector on a selector? E.g. $("#Pages").children(".child-1");
[13:53:16] <BillCriswell> ProfElm: Exactly like that.
[13:53:26] <BillCriswell> If you want to look deeper than children use .find()
[13:53:33] <ProfElm> That's not quite working. I think find might work.
[13:54:31] <BillCriswell> ProfElm: You may also need filter if you're trying to get the roots? Like... $('li').find('.someClassOnLi') won't work, you would need to do $('li').filter('someClassOnLi').whatever()
[13:54:53] <BillCriswell> .fliter('.someClassOnLi') *
[13:54:56] <ProfElm> I see, I think I figure d out what was going on.
[13:55:02] <ProfElm> The thing is that I was filtering like this...
[13:55:02] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeeet.
[13:55:33] <ProfElm> $("#elem .class"), which returned two "li" elements with class "class".
[13:55:44] <ProfElm> And I was trying to filter those further
[13:55:53] <duch_kazatel> ProfElm that'll return all elements with .class that are inside of #elem.
[13:55:59] <ProfElm> Right.
[13:56:00] <duch_kazatel> just like css.
[13:56:05] <ProfElm> But then I couldn't filter those duch_kazatel .
[13:56:11] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> if it's not a lot of elements, .each() is a great place to start ;)
[13:56:42] <duch_kazatel> * :)
[13:57:10] <BillCriswell> $('#elem .classOne').filter('.classTwo'); but also $('#elem .classOne.classTwo') can work.
[13:57:20] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[14:03:39] <BillCriswell> Why am I so repulsed by string concatenation?
[14:04:58] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell depends on when you're doing it :)
[14:05:56] <jphase> wordwrap ftl?
[14:09:58] <BillCriswell> Say whatttt
[14:11:37] <AliG1000> How would I pre-populate this slider http://jsfiddle.net/LTCDU/ so that the min value stored in a database is 75, then this is the initial slider position?
[14:12:47] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 something tells me the "values" property has something to dop with it.
[14:12:49] <duch_kazatel> *do
[14:13:51] <AliG1000> duch_kazatel:  for sure, but I don't know how to set them.  Everything I try breaks it
[14:20:52] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 you'll have to expose that info to your page.
[14:21:10] <duch_kazatel> you could create an object and set various properties on it for things like that.
[14:21:43] <duch_kazatel> and then use that reference in place of that number.
[14:26:54] <AliG1000> not sure what you mean but, looking at my code I thought it was line 15 I needed to alter, but that doesn't work for me'
[14:31:51] <AliG1000> Oh, Line 9.  I think this works now. checking
[14:34:47] <duch_kazatel> Yes - line 6 sets your upper/lower values, whereas 7 and 8 set your min/max values.
[14:34:53] <duch_kazatel> basically, min/max vs range
[15:50:26] <tehopeologist> hey all
[15:51:24] <tehopeologist> anyone got an idea on how to only display characters BEFORE a certain character via JS/jQuery?
[15:51:37] <tehopeologist> ie: 1234 Main Street, City, FL
[15:51:45] <tehopeologist> i only want 1234 Main Street
[15:51:50] <tehopeologist> but the var has all of it
[15:52:28] <duch_kazatel> you want to split on the comma?
[15:52:31] <tehopeologist> yeah
[15:52:34] <tehopeologist> is it just .split?
[15:52:37] <tehopeologist> O_o
[15:52:42] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:52:44] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[15:52:49] <duch_kazatel> .split(',');
[15:52:53] <tehopeologist> sexy.
[15:52:56] <tehopeologist> imma try it :D
[15:52:59] <tehopeologist> thanks for the tip
[15:53:06] <tehopeologist> trying to make this google result not so gross looking
[15:53:12] <tehopeologist> gives me like city, state, country
[15:53:17] <tehopeologist> O_o  rofl, don't need all of that
[15:54:10] <duch_kazatel> try .split(',')[1];
[15:54:16] <duch_kazatel> err, [0] actually.
[15:54:37] <tehopeologist> mkay
[15:55:04] <duch_kazatel> .split() generates an array.
[15:57:23] <tehopeologist> duch_kazatel: you familiar with the maps API?
[16:41:40] <seriaph> hello chaps
[16:46:06] <seriaph> I have a strange question if anybody is around to answer it. Is there any drawbacks to doing something such as $($('#selector')[0])?
[16:48:50] <shoky> seriaph: it's the same as doing $('#selector').first() or .eq(0). but that's never really needed for an ID query like that, since it will never match more than one element anyway
[16:49:02] <dni> yep
[16:50:11] <seriaph> Interesting! Thanks shoky.
[17:31:27] <barraponto> is there a selector for input values?
[17:31:49] <barraponto> like jQuery('select[:value="first-option"]')
[17:33:13] <subsonic> Will more memory be used if I keep calling .sortable() on the same elements?
[17:33:17] <shoky> barraponto: no but you can make one (i'm sure stackoverflow has examples) and you can just use .filter(function() { return this.value === 'first-option' })
[17:33:48] <barraponto> shoky: I'm building the selector from the backend, so I'd rather use an actual selector.
[17:35:23] <barraponto> I'm using jquery.validate to check for unique values on multiple select elements, but I don't care if the "none" value is not unique.
[17:35:59] <barraponto> shoky: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15031698 is this a good approach?
[17:36:48] <shoky> that's a fine approach for making such a selector, sure.. but building selectors in your backend sounds like a bad one
[17:47:29] <gabriel_> !rules
[17:49:33] <duch_kazatel> gabrui
[17:49:36] <duch_kazatel> err, whoops!
[18:09:31] <barraponto> shoky: you know, CMS that does everything for the site builder... like Drupal.
[18:14:37] <chachan> hey guys, I'm working in a product details page. I'm using fancybox to open a lightbox for the main picture. There are some thumbnails and I want that when an user clicks a thumbnails, it should become a main image. Can I do this with fancybox or do I need to make the replacement by myself?
[18:15:14] <chachan> I know this is not the fancybox support channel. Just shooting from the hips...
[18:16:46] <duch_kazatel> chachan can you supply a working example of the problem?
[18:17:04] <chachan> duch_kazatel, http://goo.gl/kVyF3z
[18:17:30] <duch_kazatel> I'm sorry - of your code.
[18:17:34] <chachan> duch_kazatel, when you click a thumbnail, it opens a lightbox, I want to replace the main image by the clicked thumbnail
[18:17:36] <chachan> makes sense?
[18:17:57] <duch_kazatel> and still open the lightbox?
[18:18:01] <duch_kazatel> or simply swap out that main image?
[18:18:22] <chachan> duch_kazatel, just swap them
[18:19:01] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with lightbox :)  you'll have to remove whatever makes lightbox bind to those thumbnails and then build your own setup to swap out that main image afaik
[18:19:58] <chachan> duch_kazatel, I was expecting that answer :) Just wanted to be 100% sure. Thank you!
[18:20:07] <duch_kazatel> sure
[19:01:12] <Leo2013> Hello i need Help .. i dont know jnothing about java script :D ... i embed a countdown on my site .. but i need something like a timer just something who told the user how long the site is online just like ... 200 Days - 07 Hours - 59 Minutes - 30 Second (past from the start date)  my embed code is: ...
[19:01:20] <Leo2013> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/966d6d8e4731cb33a6b5
[19:01:45] <Leo2013> Can i do a correction in this code to get it run ? ??
[19:01:51] <Leo2013> Please Help me if you can
[19:04:12] <Leo2013> No1 knows ?
[19:05:56] <jphase> Leo2013: I don't have much focus to help you right now but maybe try http://e.ggtimer.com/
[19:06:28] <jphase> I mean, it'd be pretty easy to write on your own if you had the date object of when your site launched
[19:06:44] <jphase> but there's probably some easy script you can use
[19:07:14] <Leo2013> okay jphase - i will try to find another script
[19:08:17] <jphase> sorry Leo2013, just don't have time to check to see if homeboy's script is worth while hehe. But if you google "javascript find difference between two dates" then you could probably come up with something pretty easily if you had the launch date in object form.
[19:10:43] <Leo2013> Okay No Problem you helped me a little bit with the link :) i would try
[19:20:29] <thom_> its been a while since i have done this so im a bit rusty.... if someone could go to www.thinkrium.com/clients/mtech
[19:20:46] <thom_> click on the menu links and tell me why my slides arent smooth
[19:28:39] <louism2wash> does anyone know of any gotchas with the remove() method?  I am animating dom elements height and width to 0 and then calling remove() on the dom element which is not being removed from the dom.
[19:30:51] <shoky> louism2wash: no gotchas.. it removes from the dom. something else is going on in your thing.. or maybe you're wrong about it not being removed ;p
[19:31:35] <louism2wash> shoky: according to the chrome developer tools it is still in the dom…. I'll have to mess around a bit and then maybe post some code
[19:32:27] <louism2wash> shoky: it is a backbone.js app so there could be something going on there as well
[19:32:52] <shoky> ya make a testcase
[19:34:18] <ocmax> hi there, i have a short question about the post method of jquery
[19:34:35] <ocmax> which type i have to transmit there as my form data?
[19:34:47] <nevahsobah> is http://getbootstrap.com/ just a jquery ui replacement
[19:35:10] <ocmax> i want to construct the object {firstparameter:"value"} automatically
[19:35:39] <shoky> automatically from what?
[19:36:04] <ocmax> i read the values by input tags
[19:36:37] <shoky> you might want .serialize()  donno
[19:37:20] <ocmax> i have some vars i want to add optionally like: {firstparameter:"value"} if firstparameter != "" , {firstparameter:"value",sparameter:"value2"}  if first and second != "" ...
[19:38:05] <malaphus> Hi guys.  I'm using $parent = window.parent.jQuery.noConflict() in an iframe so that I can create elements using jquery in the parent, this works fine however when I crease a dialog this way the dragable nature of the dialog gets really weird, it only drags once, and after I close the dialog I can no longer click anything on the page
[19:38:09] <malaphus> Any idea what might cause that?
[19:39:02] <Velveeta> shoky
[19:39:25] <ocmax> shoky, something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jpLU5/
[19:39:33] <ocmax> but this is not working
[19:46:10] <shoky> ocmax: http://jsfiddle.net/jpLU5/1/
[19:46:34] <shoky> well, something like that
[19:47:01] <ocmax> shoky, the problem is not the checking, its he container of formdata
[19:47:08] <ocmax> its not working with an array
[19:47:16] <shoky> ocmax: take a closer look at my fiddle..
[19:49:26] <ocmax> sorry, didn't look right. thx
[19:50:11] <shoky> sup Velveeta
[19:50:56] <Velveeta> nadaâ€¦ i was just answering malaphus's questionâ€¦ shoky might cause that
[19:51:09] <shoky> ;D
[19:54:12] <Velveeta> wtf, my irc is still working, so my internet connection is apparently active, and yet my browser isn't doing anythingâ€¦ i wonder if my dns server went out
[19:54:59] <shibly> Hi
[19:55:48] <Velveeta> well, from my terminal i can ping my own web site by name, so name resolution is working properly...
[19:59:22] <Velveeta> brb
[20:24:26] <TheJHNZ> o/
[21:15:36] <Xander92> hey guys
[21:15:47] <Xander92> How to I increment values with attr?
[21:15:53] <Xander92> For ex: $(this).find('.class').attr('data-number', ?);
[21:16:23] <Xander92> If I wanted to bump all the data-numbers +1
[21:16:47] <Xander92> Or do I need to use an each?
[21:16:47] <seriaph> is there any specific event you want to increment them on?
[21:17:09] <Xander92> Well, they're incrementing on a click function, so this is part of the code within that function
[21:24:47] <seriaph> http://jsfiddle.net/D7zjG/
[21:24:59] <seriaph> something like that would do the trick, though there's probably a better way.
[21:28:38] <Xander92> That's kind of what I'm doing at the moment, although it needs a parseInt, otherwise it simply goes 1 to 11
[21:35:09] <shoky> Xander92: .attr('data-number', function(i,num){ return 1+Number(num) })
[21:36:32] <TheJHNZ> o/
[21:46:03] <Xander92> thanks shoky, works perfect
[23:57:15] <BrazenBraden> if you have a series of divs with the same class generated dynamically, each containing a select box, what sort of code would one need to do something whenever any of the select boxes are 'changed' in any of the divs?
