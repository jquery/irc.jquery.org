[00:12:50] <MatBoy> morning guys!
[00:13:23] <MatBoy> I was wondering how I can display all data from a table. In PHP I use a while for an example
[00:13:36] <manuel_> $("tr").each ?
[00:15:49] <jrockjiggz> ?replace img src
[00:15:51] <bot-t1> jrockjiggz, .attr() - Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[00:16:46] <MatBoy> manuel_: I'm new to jquery so :)
[00:16:52] <manuel_> :}
[00:16:57] <manuel_> i'm not very fluent either
[00:16:59] <MatBoy> manuel_: shall I give you a link to the code ?
[00:17:06] <manuel_> sorry if that came across as smartassish
[00:17:10] <manuel_> MatBoy: sure
[00:17:36] <MatBoy> manuel_: here you go, this is what I use for learning :) http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107
[00:27:20] <MatBoy> manuel_: doable ?
[00:27:27] <manuel_> sorry?
[00:27:32] <manuel_> i left the channel :/
[00:27:56] <MatBoy> manuel_: oh here you go
[00:28:02] <MatBoy> manuel_: here you go, this is what I use for learning :) http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107
[00:28:31] <manuel_> ok, and you want to?
[00:28:53] <MatBoy> manuel_: now this example displays one row and I want to display all
[00:29:00] <MatBoy> I have more rows in my table
[00:29:16] <MatBoy> so I need some while @ the jquery side I guess
[00:29:22] <manuel_> ok
[00:29:24] <MatBoy> for each maybe
[00:29:41] <manuel_> you need to fetch all the rows on the php side
[00:29:44] <manuel_> and encode them in json first
[00:30:16] <MatBoy> ok, that json part might be the issue... I'm OK with PHP :)
[00:30:33] <MatBoy> I have read about it, I need to do something with XML ?
[00:30:36] <manuel_> then you can do $.each(data, function (idx, row) { $("<tr><td>" + row[0] + ‚Ä¶).appendTo(table); });
[00:30:50] <manuel_> no, jsonis a lightweight syntax to replace xml
[00:30:58] <MatBoy> ok :)
[00:31:05] <manuel_> so you need to $data = mysql_fetch_all(); return json_encode($data) or something like that
[00:31:23] <MatBoy> ok thanks
[00:31:35] <MatBoy> it's not easy to learn when you come from PHP
[00:32:14] <jrockjiggz> JS != PHP
[00:33:41] <manuel_> yes js can be a quirky language
[00:37:23] <MatBoy> jrockjiggz: did I say it is ?
[00:40:19] <jrockjiggz> just stating the obvious...
[00:40:53] <MatBoy> jrockjiggz: hehe ;) geek :P
[00:41:08] <MatBoy> manuel_: you are right... but you need to on a mobile phone
[01:15:53] <howardgrigg> ajpiano: cheers for your help earlier  - here is the end(ish) result http://dcbc.co.nz/binnumbers/form.html
[01:44:06] <jquerier> hi
[01:51:17] <xonev> i want to prevent the enter key from going to a new line in a textarea
[01:51:19] <xonev> any ideas?
[01:55:30] <xonev> i've tried event.preventDefault() and 'return false;'
[01:56:29] <blackspotwiggins> xonev, you need to remove newline manually
[01:57:07] <xonev> blackspotwiggins: hmm, you're sure there's no way to stop it from inserting?
[01:57:33] <blackspotwiggins> im not sure, but i cant think of any other way than what you described
[01:57:52] <xonev> blackspotwiggins: i just figured it out
[01:58:14] <xonev> blackspotwiggins: the problem was i was only binding to the keyup event - i needed to return false from the keypress event
[01:58:30] <blackspotwiggins> ah, that might be it
[02:26:37] <jqh_mhtn> hi all, why is this animation happening twice? http://pastie.org/2437941
[02:27:32] <jqh_mhtn> is anyone here?
[02:27:32] <ruby_on_tails> manuel_: http://jsfiddle.net/5CfXt/11/ i have pasted some html as well, try clicking the asset/profitloss links
[02:27:38] <ruby_on_tails> basically it toggles some TR
[02:27:41] <ruby_on_tails> TRs*
[02:34:44] <jqh_mhtn> can anyone explain why calling ".show('slide', {direction: 'left'})" happens twice?
[02:34:50] <jqh_mhtn> it's driving me nuts
[03:04:59] <hemanth> instead of preload(), does loading and img to a div and hide and display it for a click action, sounds right?
[03:05:21] <SIDU> <b></b><img><span>me here</span>==>b.click: $(this).next().next().next().html('new text')
[03:05:28] <SIDU> how to update above to nicer jq

[03:07:06] <SIDU> $(this).next('span').html() does not work :(
[03:07:53] <jrockjiggz> $(this).closest('span')
[03:08:37] <SIDU> ok fixed. nextAll() works. i was using nextAll() not working , i guess cache problem ?
[03:09:32] <SIDU> $.post(..data) ==>howto pass back 2 data ? or
[03:09:48] <SIDU> data = "some text |cut here: data 2 "
[03:09:50] <SIDU> possible ?
[03:10:41] <SIDU> data = <div>all divs</div><p>this is the only p in data</p> so each to cut the p off ?
[03:11:31] <SIDU> my data contains all <div>, and i need to pass back an int as well. howto the easiest ?
[03:13:39] <SIDU> also q2: howto apply $(document).ready(function(){ to the data get from post ?
[03:13:45] <MatBoy> nice, I try to use cookies on phonegap... auch!
[03:14:20] <SIDU> data is only plain text with html tags
[03:14:31] <SIDU> no html header etc
[03:19:12] <SIDU> .post(...,data) howto cut the last element from data ?
[03:19:36] <fabiobik> hello

[03:21:57] <SIDU> $(this).append('X')
[03:27:07] <pgherveou> hello there I am trying to extend the sortable plugin to make it work in on a more data driven fashion,
[03:27:07] <pgherveou> I realized that if I extend the plugin I loose interaction you get with draggable through the connectToSortable option
[03:27:07] <pgherveou> Looking at the draggable code it looks like it comes from the fact that draggable interact with sortable through the sortable data property
[03:27:09] <pgherveou> $.data(this, 'sortable');
[03:27:11] <pgherveou> can we force extended plugin to use the same data property ?
[03:31:51] <pgherveou> found out that setting widgetName does the trick
[03:45:18] <Stava> There must be a better way to do this: $(this).children(".navigation").children("li").children("a")
[03:45:45] <blackspotwiggins> Stava, $(this).find(".navigation > li > a")
[03:45:53] <Stava> blackspotwiggins, great, thanks
[03:48:36] <FakeHeal> I want to make a button "Scroll to top" with jQuery & I want this button to appear only when user has scrolled down and does not see the top of the page. Any ideas ? (:
[03:50:46] <jrockjiggz> $("html").scrollTop();
[03:51:41] <MatBoy> wow HTML5 localStorage is great!
[04:01:08] <SIDU> <b onclick='ff()'>-</b> fn ff(){alert($(this).html()); ==> says: null ? i just can not find out where is the err ?
[04:01:10] <jonee> hi! anybody familiar with a facebook like contacts search plugin ?
[04:02:32] <SIDU> or anyone tells me howto apply document.ready fn to data from .post() ?
[04:05:55] <FakeHeal> jrockjiggz:  function toTop(){$("html, body").animate({scrollTop:0},1000);} html -> <a href="javascript:toTop()"> Top</a>, and I want this link to be shown if the user's not on viewing the top of the page? (:
[04:07:06] <blackspotwiggins> FakeHeal, use css?
[04:07:48] <FakeHeal> add id and in the css to set display: none
[04:08:12] <FakeHeal> but the thing I dont know is how to check which part of the page
[04:08:19] <FakeHeal> the user's viewing (:
[04:09:11] <blackspotwiggins> for that you need to use js
[04:09:39] <blackspotwiggins> window scroll event for starters
[04:11:06] <FakeHeal> window.onscroll?
[04:15:52] <FakeHeal> blackspotwiggins, thanks a lot! I'm a beginner and I'm not that familiar with all functions js/jquery provides.
[04:17:39] <SIDU> i guess, jq not applied to data get from post, so that everything not working
[04:17:55] <SIDU> however use old js, works
[04:18:04] <SIDU> but more lines of code.
[04:21:50] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/bdGgS/ - how do I make it so that when the first button is clicked, a second button comes sliding in from underneath it?
[04:26:49] <Segaja> muzone: onclick of the first button define some slidUp animation or so for the second
[04:27:31] <muzone> lets see
[04:27:55] <Segaja> muzone: another thing: you have the same id two times in your html code
[04:27:58] <Segaja> that shouldn't be
[04:28:03] <Segaja> an id should be unique on the page
[04:28:21] <Segaja> actually the id is in it 3 times
[04:29:39] <muzone> Segaja: well its like two different scenarios
[04:29:45] <muzone> hold up im redefining the paste
[04:30:19] <muzone> Actually http://jsfiddle.net/fKyjB/ is as far as I can take it Segaja
[04:30:42] <muzone> might you give me a hand?
[04:32:41] <Segaja> i'm trying :)
[04:35:15] <paveq> hi
[04:35:22] <paveq> whats the best solution for forms?
[04:35:23] <Segaja> muzone:
[04:35:24] <Segaja> http://jsfiddle.net/ZNpTX/1/
[04:35:37] <paveq> I need to prevent normal page reloading, and capture text from text field
[04:36:04] <paveq> I don't even need submit button, just capture the text when enter is pressed
[04:36:11] <paveq> doing irc client here :)
[04:36:14] <Segaja> muzone: i used .fadeIn('slow') because it was the first that came to my mind.
[04:36:43] <Segaja> paveq: when enter is pressed on a <input> field it is the .submit() function called
[04:36:59] <muzone> hahaaaaaaaaaaaa!
[04:37:01] <paveq> yep, I need to capture that
[04:37:03] <muzone> Segaja: you are the MAN!!!
[04:37:08] <paveq> Segaja: do I need to use plugin?
[04:37:09] <Segaja> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[04:37:13] <muzone> towering above all other men:)
[04:37:15] <Segaja> paveq: i don't think so
[04:37:23] * muzone gives Segaja a hug and shakes his hand repeatedly with a sick grin
[04:37:25] <paveq> Segaja: when I google "jquery forms" it kind of tells me so
[04:37:44] <Segaja> paveq: yes, but you can do much without the form plugin
[04:38:42] <paveq> Segaja: thanks :)
[04:38:47] <Segaja> yw
[04:41:46] <bosky101> does anyoen know the khan academy irc channel name ?
[04:45:21] <MatBoy> so you always have to echo data to a jquery script?
[04:45:50] <Segaja> MatBoy: what?
[04:48:42] <MatBoy> Segaja: from a PHP script
[04:49:02] <Segaja> MatBoy: sorry. i don't get the context
[04:51:30] <MatBoy> Segaja: when I query something using PHP @ the serverside... do I always need to echo the data to the jquery script ?
[04:51:50] <MatBoy> let me see, I have an example
[04:52:55] <MatBoy> Segaja: here you go http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/107
[04:53:04] <MatBoy> look @ the echo "yes"
[04:54:13] <Segaja> hm sorry i can't help you
[04:55:40] <MatBoy> Segaja: ok, no problem :) this works OK.. but if you always have to echo everything than you have a challenge
[04:57:13] <muzone> Segaja: At your paste here - http://jsfiddle.net/ZNpTX/1/ - what's a good way to dim out the first button after it's pressed?
[04:57:36] <muzone> Like how do I add some CSS to it?
[04:59:16] <Segaja> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/xtuUD/
[04:59:32] <Segaja> ah dim out. sorry. so you want to gray it out?
[05:00:57] <paveq> Segaja: now it works.. I can get the text from the field with .val(), but how would I clear the field?
[05:01:16] <Segaja> paveq: .val('') ?
[05:01:53] <muzone> Segaja: yup, to like signify that it's already been pressed..
[05:02:17] <paveq> Segaja: doh, didn't realize val also sets the value for object :p
[05:03:21] <Segaja> muzone: hang on
[05:06:30] <Segaja> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/Q3Xww/
[05:06:40] <Segaja> something like that?
[05:08:24] <Segaja> muzone: you can also add some .css() stuff there. see http://api.jquery.com/css/
[05:16:15] <muzone> sorry Segaja, got a weak wireless connection here
[05:16:33] <Segaja> did you get my paste?
[05:17:44] <muzone> Segaja: .css() stuff? like this you mean? http://jsfiddle.net/Q3Xww/2/
[05:18:02] <Deafgoose> Can anybody tell me why my 2nd json call gets triggered 3 times together when select the first select box the 3rd time? http://jsfiddle.net/haE92/4/
[05:18:04] <muzone> yup i did
[05:18:34] <muzone> Segaja: i'd prefer to only add css to it though as my buttons will be styled with background images and all sorts of stuff
[05:18:47] <muzone> Segaja: so im thinking after it's clicked, apply some sort of alpha effect
[05:18:58] <muzone> css alpha effect or whatever's out there
[05:19:40] <Segaja> muzone: for some reason your fiddle doesn't run for me
[05:20:04] <Segaja> ah, your css() call is wrong
[05:20:39] <Segaja> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/Q3Xww/3/
[05:20:49] <Segaja> muzone: read the http://api.jquery.com/css/ api
[05:21:01] <Segaja> muzone: i would also disable it so that noone else can click the button
[05:21:25] <muzone> Segaja: thanks a lot man:-)
[05:21:28] <muzone> yeah thats a good idea
[05:21:51] <Deafgoose> Can anybody tell me why my 2nd json call gets triggered 3 times together when select the first select box the 3rd time? http://jsfiddle.net/haE92/4/

[05:37:02] <Thorn> hello
[05:37:29] <Thorn> which html attributes can I use to pass data to a script in a cross-browser way?
[05:41:10] <sevenpluseight> hey everyone! I have a menu, in codeignitor, using a master template. the Home menu item has a class called "active" on it, what that does is add a bold/underline effect. When I click About Us page I want that active class to switch to the respective page so then About Us would have the active class and be underlined and bold. Would I be using jQuery for this? or maybe PHP?

[05:51:52] <trickz> explain me the weirdness behind such a behaviour
[05:56:03] <misterm> trickz: exactly what weirdness do you mean
[05:56:26] <trickz> it alerts 0 with "" and 1 without ""
[05:56:28] <trickz> why so ?
[05:56:34] <trickz> it should alert 1 in both case
[05:56:41] <trickz> or atleast 1 in the case of ""
[05:56:49] <howardgrigg> hey guys, can i ask for some help on an easy question - I'd like to count the number of characters in a textfield then multiple that number by a given amount and set a value on another textfield to the total - any ideas?
[05:57:38] <howardgrigg> i.e. if they type in "hello" that's 5 characters then say each character cost $10 the total would be $50
[05:57:55] <trickz> str.length * 10
[05:58:18] <trickz> $('input[type="text"]').val( (str.length * 10) );
[05:58:22] <trickz> now help me
[05:58:49] <misterm> trickz: why should it be 1 in both cases?
[05:59:36] <trickz> is there any difference between $('input[value=123]') and $('input[value="123"]') ?
[05:59:52] <misterm> trickz: yes
[05:59:57] <trickz> what ?
[06:00:07] <misterm> trickz: they're not the same thing
[06:00:20] <misterm> trickz: you can see that in that the strings are not the same length
[06:00:31] <trickz> i think they are the same
[06:00:39] <trickz> infact value="123" is more appropriate/correct
[06:00:48] <trickz> and it doesnt works ????

[06:56:11] <ThePendulum> Hey
[06:56:39] <ThePendulum> I was wondering, is there a limit for the time an animation (like slideDown or fadeOut) can durate?
[07:52:51] <ryrych> hi
[07:53:46] <ryrych> what do you recommend similar to oohembed? I did not even notice the owner changed ;(
[07:55:46] <ThePendulum> I wonder why there's a channel with 790 users and no one responds
[07:56:44] <ajpiano> have you considered the fact that it's a saturday morning in late august and one of the most active geographic corridors is about to be blasted by a hurricane
[07:57:55] <ajpiano> i don't believe there is an upper bound of time on animations
[07:58:39] <ThePendulum> Well, all 790 are in the same area? I doubt it...
[07:58:49] <ThePendulum> But good luck to those who are there
[07:59:16] <ajpiano> no of course not but in general
[07:59:55] <ThePendulum> Anyway, I tried something like '8000' which should take 8 seconds, but then it chooses to close 'fast'
[08:00:21] <ajpiano> the whole "i can't believe there are X people in this giant IRC channel and no one is answering my questions" is one of those things that makes people want to break out the world's smallest violin
[08:00:55] <ThePendulum> To me it sounds acceptable to log off things when you're not available
[08:01:31] <ThePendulum> I don't expect people to answer my question or anything, but I'd expect more activity, you understand? :)
[08:01:55] <imsky> D V N O
[08:01:58] <imsky> four capital letters
[08:02:01] <imsky> printed in gold
[08:03:34] <ajpiano> ThePendulum: of course, but how long have you really been on IRC
[08:03:57] <ThePendulum> Hmm, several years I guess
[08:03:59] <ThePendulum> Hmm, I'm trying jQuery but it seems not to be working. Does anyone know I'm doing wrong?: http://94.228.211.26/tryout/jquery , Thank you in advance!
[08:04:44] <ThePendulum> At the moment I'm in the OpenLayers, CodeIgniter and reddit-webdesign channel which are far more active despite having 1/10th the amount of users who appear to be online
[08:04:49] <imsky> you didn't wrap your stuff in $(document).ready
[08:04:51] <ThePendulum> But that's irrelevant to jQuery
[08:05:03] <imsky> or the shorter version of it, which i never use
[08:05:20] <ThePendulum> I'm just following the documentation really, hmm
[08:05:22] <ajpiano> ThePendulum: small channels with tight knit communities of people who all know each other tend to have very different ebbs and flows
[08:05:23] <ThePendulum> Let me see
[08:06:56] <ThePendulum> first there was document.body and I replaced it with "#display" and "#hide", how can I select a specific div using document.body?
[08:06:59] <ThePendulum> getElementById?
[08:07:03] <imsky> wat
[08:07:10] <imsky> you're in #jquery
[08:07:16] <ThePendulum> I know
[08:07:17] <imsky> for painful DOM function, see ##javascript
[08:07:26] <ThePendulum> ...
[08:07:42] <ThePendulum> This function should show or hide a div when I click a certain other element
[08:07:53] <imsky> yeah, wrap your crap in a .ready handler
[08:07:55] <ThePendulum> document.body sounds to me like any other element
[08:07:58] <imsky> no
[08:08:07] <ThePendulum> within the body of course
[08:08:10] <imsky> nopew
[08:08:24] <imsky> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:08:37] <imsky> if you don't read that, john resig himself can't help you
[08:09:54] <ThePendulum> why are you so harsh? I never mentioned I am not going to read that. for the love of god, I'm reading it right now
[08:10:45] <ryrych> what provider as good as former oohembed would you recommend?
[08:10:51] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure if .ready() is relevant to my issue though, after reading the documentation on it you provided
[08:10:58] <imsky> lol
[08:11:12] <howardgrigg> hey - just having some issues on setting and multiply simple variables, any helpers? http://pastie.org/2438985
[08:12:14] <imsky> ThePendulum: http://jsfiddle.net/xpPfN/
[08:12:25] <imsky> don't contradict people who are singing DVNO
[08:12:28] <imsky> four capital letters
[08:12:33] <imsky> printed in gold, la la la la la la la
[08:13:18] <ThePendulum> AHA! thanks imsky
[08:13:25] <imsky> noooo problem
[08:13:30] <ThePendulum> I missed your point before, sorry
[08:32:25] <mrryanjohnston> hey guys. I know with the audio tag I can do something like this in javascript: var v = document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0];
[08:32:31] <mrryanjohnston> v.play();
[08:32:47] <mrryanjohnston> Is there an equivalent to this in jquery so that I can do $('audio').play ?
[08:33:00] <mrryanjohnston> os $('audio').play() ?
[08:33:02] <mrryanjohnston> or*
[08:33:22] <Deafgoose> Can anybody tell me why my 2nd json call gets triggered 3 times together when select the first select box the 3rd time? http://jsfiddle.net/haE92/4/
[08:50:08] <matt0212> Can anyone offer some help on a JQ + Ajax issue?
[08:53:16] <jonee> anyone has a recommended plugin for autocomplete that looks like the facebook contacts search
[08:55:21] <blessYAHU> what is it?
[08:56:09] <blessYAHU> what's the JQ Ajax problem?
[08:57:43] <rg_> hey everyone
[08:58:26] <rg_> I'm trying to use $.post to post some data and receive from a remote server and i keep getting an error but I dont know why or how to troubleshoot it, can anyone help me?
[08:58:55] <jdevel> rg_ check out cross domains perhaps.
[08:59:21] <rg_> so if i run it on my computer locally, cross domains shouldn't be an issue, correct?
[08:59:29] <jdevel> nope
[08:59:32] <rg_> I'm also using it with phonegap
[09:00:04] <rg_> when i call it, it spits back the status as "error" and the data is [object Object]
[09:00:11] <rg_> how do i find out what that error actually is?
[09:00:23] <ThePendulum> I was wondering, what is the jQuery equivalent of "document.GetElementById("someID").style.visibility = "hidden";" ?
[09:00:36] <jdevel> have you tried debugging through some form of developer tools?
[09:00:54] <aavikkojootti> and debugging the backend
[09:01:05] <rg_> not really, im new to all of this javascript stuff, what developer tool(s) would you suggest for that?
[09:01:14] <jdevel> ThePendulum, you can do $('#someID').hide();
[09:01:32] <jdevel> $('#someID') and $('#someID')[0] will get you the element.
[09:01:52] <jdevel> the 2nd will be the element, the first is a jquery object I believe
[09:02:03] <jdevel> but should still be accessible in all the same ways.
[09:02:13] <ThePendulum> well touch√© jddevel :P, but what if I want to do something else besides hiding it? I wasn't refering to hiding it, more to the principe of altering an element
[09:02:15] <jdevel> just go with the $ object.
[09:02:26] <blessYAHU> ThePendulum: $('#someID).hide()
[09:02:41] <jdevel> just do the same things with what I mentioned..
[09:02:59] <jdevel> you can also use .css() to set properties etc.
[09:03:13] <jdevel> documentation is your friend :)
[09:03:36] <jonee> anyone has a recommended plugin for autocomplete that looks like the facebook contacts search
[09:03:45] <ThePendulum> it's often hard to read the docs if you don't know what you're looking for hehe :P
[09:03:53] <jdevel> understood.
[09:03:58] <blessYAHU> better to make a css class with the style and assign the object using $('#someID').addClass('cssClass')
[09:04:00] <ThePendulum> but thank you for your support :)
[09:04:09] <jdevel> anytime.
[09:04:49] <ThePendulum> that's a nice one bless
[09:05:00] <rg_> jdevel what would you recommend for debugging javascript?
[09:05:10] <jdevel> depends on the browser
[09:05:16] <rg_> i use chrome
[09:05:29] <jdevel> FF = firebug, chrome = built in dev tools, IE = built in dev tools.
[09:05:41] <ThePendulum> but say I want to change the content of the div, so not .style.visibility, but .innerHTML. isn't there some general way to do any modification?
[09:05:46] <jdevel> chrome = Ctrl+Shift+J
[09:05:52] <jdevel> IE = F12
[09:06:04] <ThePendulum> Chrome has a very nice development tool
[09:06:09] <ThePendulum> one of the main reasons I'm using chrome
[09:06:10] <jdevel> indeed it does
[09:06:27] <ThePendulum> If you know what jQuery is, you shouldn't be using IE anymore though :P
[09:06:27] <jdevel> nice for js injections
[09:06:39] <jdevel> you need to use IE...
[09:06:43] <ThePendulum> what for?
[09:07:05] <jdevel> it still has a huge part of the browser market...
[09:07:05] <blessYAHU> ThePendulum, not really.  .text() to change the text in the element, .html() to change the inner html..
[09:07:25] <ThePendulum> true, but why does that mean you should use it for development?
[09:07:36] <ThePendulum> allright thanks bless
[09:07:42] <jdevel> because you want your work cross browser compatible
[09:07:58] <ThePendulum> ooh yeah, but therefor I use a tool like Adobe BrowserLab
[09:08:25] <jdevel> what's that, runs multi browser engines?
[09:08:42] <ThePendulum> It's an online tool that runs your website in different browsers
[09:08:46] <ThePendulum> like Firefox for OS X if you like
[09:08:55] <ThePendulum> and shows you how it looks
[09:08:56] <jdevel> i'll take a look at that.
[09:09:00] <ThePendulum> though I must say
[09:09:09] <ThePendulum> It will be a bit difficult to test javascript with it
[09:09:23] <ThePendulum> It's more for design issues
[09:09:37] <ThePendulum> I'll try my jquery tryout page with it right now
[09:09:45] <jdevel> right, so I'll keep testing in the masses of browsers installed on my dev machine
[09:10:33] <jdevel> through IE9, you can test IE9-7 behaviors and displays
[09:10:40] <jdevel> using F12 tools.
[09:10:40] <ThePendulum> For JavaScript that might be the best, but it's nice to use it to test OS X browsers etc.
[09:10:52] <ThePendulum> You don't want to install OS X on your machine just to test browser compability hehe
[09:11:00] <jdevel> unless you have them installed already on a virtual machine..
[09:11:31] <jdevel> I've got 6 OSs on my machine running right now
[09:11:35] <ThePendulum> I mainly use it to be sure Firefox 5.0 for OS X does the job
[09:11:39] <ThePendulum> 6?!
[09:11:45] <jdevel> yep
[09:11:48] <ThePendulum> Which ones?
[09:11:51] <jdevel> multi linux installs
[09:11:55] <jdevel> a pbx system
[09:12:03] <jdevel> etc.
[09:12:07] <ThePendulum> Hexa-boot is the new Dual-boot lol
[09:12:09] <jdevel> windows 2008 server
[09:12:17] <jdevel> I don't dual boot
[09:12:29] <jdevel> I run em all parallel
[09:12:36] <ThePendulum> How's that possible?
[09:12:37] <jdevel> all are currently running at the same time
[09:12:48] <jdevel> check out VMware
[09:12:57] <jdevel> virtualization software
[09:13:12] <ThePendulum> Oh well that explains :P
[09:13:13] <jdevel> I'm running VMware workstation
[09:13:33] <jdevel> it's brilliant for development
[09:13:52] <jdevel> perfect sandbox
[09:14:32] <ThePendulum> I'm really hesitating between Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.04
[09:14:41] <jdevel> I run em both
[09:14:42] <jdevel> lol
[09:14:54] <ThePendulum> well my machine isn't powerful enough for virtualization I'm afraid :P
[09:15:01] <jdevel> ahaha
[09:15:12] <ThePendulum> I love Ubuntu for web development, but it's a pain to use it with my MIDI usb keyboard and drawing tablet. Also, somehow, it sucks to play music
[09:15:23] <jdevel> yea, this one isn't super but 4 cpus and 6g of ram
[09:15:32] <ThePendulum> And I occasionally want to play games, which is a pain as well
[09:15:42] <ThePendulum> Windows is exactly vice versa lol
[09:16:07] <djQuery> I have no problems developing on windows
[09:16:15] <jdevel> neither do I
[09:16:23] <ThePendulum> There are no problems or anything
[09:16:28] <rg_> so i'm in the Chrome developer tools and playing around but I'm not sure how to find out about this post error
[09:16:31] <ThePendulum> But it's just quicker and far more easy on Ubuntu
[09:16:33] <jdevel> actually, people bitch about windows vista, but I've never had an issue on the OS either..
[09:16:35] <ThePendulum> Also, my VPS runs ubuntu as well
[09:16:37] <jdevel> it's all in the user..
[09:16:58] <djQuery> quad core with 32 gigs of ram here.
[09:17:04] <jdevel> excellent
[09:17:10] <ThePendulum> Well Vista is worthless if you weren't running a high-end PC when it was released
[09:17:12] <djQuery> damn sharepoint vm was taking up tooooo much ram
[09:17:18] <jdevel> obviously running a 64 bit system
[09:18:01] <ThePendulum> Ahum, jdevel & djQuery, my: Intele Celeron D (1x3,4ghz), 2GB RAM (GeIL 1x2, 333mhz), nVidea GeForce GT220 (512mb)
[09:18:07] <jdevel> ThePendulum, you should check out VMware Player.. it's free and you might be able to play around with at least a 2nd OS on your box
[09:18:10] <ThePendulum> *Intel
[09:19:02] <jdevel> I'm telling you though, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities when you start to virtualize
[09:19:09] <imsky> virtualbox > vmware
[09:19:14] <ThePendulum> I virtualized before mate
[09:19:20] <jdevel> right on
[09:19:24] <ThePendulum> Resulted in pretty bad stuff lol
[09:19:27] <djQuery> ThePendulum: lol you wont even be able to find more memory to throw at that thing will u?
[09:19:41] <ThePendulum> The 2gb is of a 4gb set
[09:19:47] <ThePendulum> But my motherboard has a 2gb limit -_-
[09:20:25] <ThePendulum> I have the other module laying around but I can't use it :P
[09:20:31] <djQuery> new mb+cpu+mem can be as cheep as 300 and blow that thing away
[09:20:46] <ThePendulum> I don't want to waste my money on a mediocre PC
[09:20:56] <ThePendulum> If I'm going to buy a new one, it needs to be one of the most powerful available :P
[09:20:58] <imsky> you're running a celeron
[09:21:01] <ThePendulum> well at least, the best parts
[09:21:08] <imsky> wrong again
[09:21:18] <imsky> get the best-performing parts for the least amount of money
[09:21:31] <ThePendulum> I didn't know a lot about hardware 4 years ago lol
[09:21:35] <ThePendulum> I was 11 for god sake
[09:21:36] <imsky> yeah
[09:21:37] <jdevel> right, because they will be old news in a couple months time
[09:21:53] <djQuery> a 100 mb is typicaly good enough for me.  200 on the 2nd or 3rd newest AMD proc and then just memory left
[09:22:04] <ThePendulum> Anyway, I'm going to get some food
[09:22:05] <ThePendulum> Later guys
[09:22:17] <imsky> djQuery: 100mb for what
[09:22:35] <djQuery> mother board
[09:22:42] <systemfault> what?
[09:22:43] <imsky> oh
[09:22:46] <djQuery> $100 mother board
[09:23:01] <imsky> lol
[09:23:12] <imsky> i don't think i've seen people differentiate mobos by price before
[09:23:20] <systemfault> I can sell MBs to djQuery ?
[09:23:32] <imsky> yes, just mark them up 3x
[09:23:32] <systemfault> I have a 1 TB drive I could sell him
[09:23:50] <djQuery> every year or 2 I upgrade mine and give current to my wife\kids
[09:24:06] <djQuery> systemfault: already got 10 tb of drive
[09:24:16] <systemfault> :)
[09:24:32] <djQuery> was running low till I deleted some DB
[09:24:34] <systemfault> 10TB drives... the impression of security.
[09:24:58] <imsky> i'm feeling pretty breezy with 3 TB
[09:25:04] <imsky> how can you run out of space with 10 TB
[09:25:30] <systemfault> I'd be scared to have that much data on a single drive.
[09:25:39] <imsky> is it on a single drive?
[09:25:56] <systemfault> Well, that's what djQuery said.. I think
[09:26:52] <systemfault> I blame the humanity.. still storing data in a something with mecanical moving parts..
[09:27:04] <systemfault> That's beyond stupidity :/
[09:29:27] <djQuery> imsky: when you are dealing with big databases you can run out pretty quick
[09:29:54] <imsky> for sure
[09:29:59] <djQuery> systemfault: and no I have 5 2tb drives
[09:30:39] <djQuery> it got to the point where I had to delete one db to be able to work on a differnet db.
[09:31:10] <djQuery> and even with all the stuff I have on this machine upgrades on mine would still take less time than the customers.
[09:32:18] <systemfault> :)
[09:33:18] <djQuery> we gonna do any jquery today?
[09:33:48] <systemfault> I'm a traitor so no..
[09:34:05] <systemfault> New project at work is using yui3
[09:35:34] <djQuery> systemfault: any good havent played with it
[09:38:35] <systemfault> A bit more difficult to learn than jQuery because it's a bit more complex (It has its loader for example). But I think it pays in the long term as its API is nicer.
[09:39:28] <systemfault> They tried to make it easier to use with simpleyui but imho.. that's not the way to go.
[10:10:55] <jdevel> anyone have any good plugin ideas that I should code?
[10:12:35] <jdevel> i've seen a number of sliders, one for pay, another that just didn't work well cross browser wise.. so I'm finishing up one of those.  Wondering about what I should do next.
[10:13:10] <jdevel> I'm also writing them to reduce the bloated css files that come with many plugins.
[10:19:31] <jdevel> ColKurtz, your name made me want a sandwich
[10:22:18] <Kamakazi> anybody have any JQuery calendar suggestions
[10:22:50] <jdevel> regarding plugin development?
[10:24:01] <Kamakazi> meant to say "jquery calendar plugin suggestions"
[10:24:11] <jdevel> i think once HTML5 is fully supported the calendar is going to be a built in part of the form type
[10:24:31] <jdevel> well input type rather
[10:24:37] <Kamakazi> that will be nice
[10:25:05] <jdevel> yea, I was thinking about doing a lot of jquery stuff for forms.. but HTML5 is going to take care of a lot of it.
[10:25:21] <Kamakazi> problem being support is still iffy at best
[10:25:29] <Kamakazi> all the cool stuff is a cross platform nighmare
[10:25:31] <jdevel> indeed you are right
[10:25:32] <Kamakazi> nightmare*
[10:25:43] <jdevel> I know, I've already experienced it
[10:25:54] <Kamakazi> on most recent site decided to try and use canvas for a bunch of stuff...scrapped that
[10:26:04] <jdevel> made me wait a little on HTML5 development
[10:26:08] <jdevel> just not supported enough yet.
[10:26:09] <Kamakazi> Yep
[10:26:19] <Kamakazi> Although I am a big fan of the <video> tag
[10:26:34] <jdevel> I play with it in chrome... yea and the supported files types..
[10:26:39] <jdevel> going to be nice for iOS..
[10:26:54] <plainas> hey all
[10:26:55] <Kamakazi> Yep
[10:26:57] <Kamakazi> howdy
[10:27:25] <plainas> is there any way to rever jQuery.noconflict() ater I've done whatever I wanted with other libraries?
[10:27:35] <plainas> *revert
[10:32:44] <jdevel> plainas, I'm guessing you already looked at: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:37:02] <Kamakazi> so I am reasonably new to jquery...just discoveredd the .ajax call....now a big fan
[10:41:24] <jdevel> yea, I've actually writting my own object for ajax, which is very simple, can call and bind to elements in a single short line of code.. however jquery added a bit more than I did.
[10:42:07] <jdevel> I absolutely have to give credit where credit is due, jquery did a lot of things very nicely.
[10:42:57] <jdevel> so I've stopped working on my own JS library as I can't keep up with the community jquery has so I figured I'd just start to contribute to jquery..
[10:43:48] <djQuery> Kamakazi: there are plenty of plugins to reproduce everything in html5 forms
[10:44:10] <djQuery> http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html
[10:45:02] <djQuery> jdevel: .tmpl + knockout.js
[10:47:01] <ColKurtz> ejsy
[10:47:08] <ColKurtz> what's up djQuery
[10:47:25] <djQuery> just learnin MVC
[10:47:35] <ColKurtz> me too.
[10:47:42] <ColKurtz> any particular framework?
[10:48:03] <djQuery> .net  razor view engin pretty cool
[10:48:14] <ColKurtz> ahh mvc in ASP
[10:49:19] <djQuery> ColKurtz: if I was gonna do it in something else I would look at backbone.js
[10:50:40] <aavikkojootti> i dont like of the auth system of MVC
[10:51:04] <aavikkojootti> +the MVC
[10:51:53] * ColKurtz googles backbone
[10:52:23] <djQuery> ?backbone.js
[10:52:26] <bot-t1> djQuery, #9212 (jQuery with classes) ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9212
[10:52:48] <ColKurtz> ?g backbone.js
[10:52:49] <bot-t1> ColKurtz, Backbone.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/

[10:52:50] <bot-t1> colkurtz, Backbone.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[11:00:44] <djQuery> plainas: you should just be able to do $= jQuery
[11:11:06] <jdevel> djQuery, just looked at knockoutjs examples and wasn't overly impressed.
[11:16:35] <plainas> jdevel, yes I looked at that page (obviously?)
[11:18:02] <dabear> hi people
[11:18:05] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/6SA6y/1/
[11:18:17] <dabear> I need a good effect that would really stand out
[11:18:28] <dabear> any ideas beside increasing the font?
[11:19:39] <jdevel> not sure what you mean by (obviously?) plainas
[11:23:43] <plainas> jdevel, that i thought that was abvious but aparently is not
[11:23:56] <plainas> either way, I did (obviously or not)
[11:24:25] <jdevel> I must be missing something because I don't really know what your talking about :/
[11:24:51] <plainas> noconflict()
[11:24:54] <jdevel> ohhh
[11:25:14] <plainas> lets say I am using another library, I use noconflict() to free the $ name
[11:25:23] <jdevel> well, many people ask questions here without even looking at documentation.
[11:26:23] <plainas> jdevel, I believe so, but i'm not sure we should assume that sistematically... if it matters that is
[11:27:00] <plainas> anyway... so I want to include free the $ name but later assign it agin to jquery
[11:27:04] <jdevel> fair enough, so not that's settled.. back to the ?
[11:27:09] <plainas> should i just $=jQuery?
[11:27:56] <plainas> this is for a wordpress plugin
[11:28:31] <plainas> most of the people use jquery with wordpress... but I need to load other libraries that also assign $
[11:29:47] <jdevel> you can also assign jquery to another shortcut if that helps
[11:29:56] <jdevel> like $j = jquery;
[11:31:10] <ravenzz> var j = jQuery.noConflict();
[11:31:11] <ravenzz> :?
[11:31:30] <ravenzz> console.log(j('#foo').html());
[11:31:44] <djQuery> plainas: if you just wrap all your code in a funciton it wont realy matter.    (function($){   /* Doesnt matter what $ is outside of this funciton */ }){jQuery);
[11:33:02] <djQuery> this is the way that all plugins should do it, but you can run your code in there as well.
[11:33:18] <jdevel> just don't think you can prototype in there
[11:33:36] <ravenzz> btw why using different libraries like mootools and jquery?
[11:38:36] <jdevel> yea so the noConflict returns the jquery object. so you can just assign that to whatever var and access it via your new object.
[11:38:38] <impatient> forgive me for the nonsense I am about to ask
[11:38:53] <impatient> I don't know a good way to word it :\
[11:39:09] <jdevel> or encapsulate like djQuery said
[11:39:59] <impatient> there a mechanism I can use to grab only the -first- descendant(s) matched by a given selector?
[11:40:22] <impatient> so like "#foo ul" would match <div id="foo"> <ul>
[11:40:34] <impatient> but not <div id="foo"> <ul> <ul>
[11:40:49] <ravenzz> $('#foo > ul')
[11:41:06] <impatient> I was about to clarify that away :)
[11:41:17] <impatient> I need it to match <div id="foo"> <div> <ul> also
[11:41:19] <MatBoy> I'm looking for a simple query using a php file and a html file for the jquery.. so server/client side that can query multiple rows and I can' t find an example online... is someone willing to help ?
[11:41:47] <impatient> like once a match is hit, said match's descendants aren't analyzed
[11:42:05] <impatient> siblings are still analyzed, just not descendants of a match
[11:42:12] <jdevel> ravenzz, impatient, you can also use $('#myID').find('>ul');
[11:43:04] <MatBoy> I wonder why such examples are nowhere to find ?
[11:43:17] <jdevel> mostly covered in selectors I believe
[11:43:31] <impatient> jdevel: how is that different than $("#myId>ul") ?
[11:43:50] <jdevel> it's not really different, but you can use it on this.find() etc..
[11:44:03] <impatient> right
[11:44:08] <impatient> not really what I need tho :\
[11:44:29] <jdevel> ravenzz example is perfectly fine too
[11:44:32] <impatient> I need something similar to the > selector but it doesn't care if its an immediate child or not
[11:44:45] <impatient> just cares if its the FIRST match in the given descendant chain
[11:45:09] <jdevel> > is for child
[11:45:10] <hsbot>   Not in scope: `is'Not in scope: `for'Not in scope: `child'
[11:45:15] <plainas> the use case is: I am writting a plugin for wordpress that uses a js script that assigns $, the problem is that both jquery and that other script ,ust be included
[11:45:28] <plainas> I'm not sure there's a solution without hacking that other script :S
[11:46:17] <impatient> jquery also defines a jQuery objectg
[11:46:23] <jdevel> should be able to use noConflict(true) and use the return object to use jquery, and $ for the other library
[11:47:17] <MoTiOnXml> if jQuery was released by apple they would have charged 40$
[11:47:21] <impatient> meh, this problem is annoying the fuck outta me
[11:47:41] <jdevel> is the other script part of a CMS?
[11:48:49] <plainas> jdevel, it's a slideshow script
[11:49:20] <plainas> jdevel,hacking its source should work, but doesn't feel so elegant for many reasons
[11:49:51] <impatient> there a filter method for jquery?
[11:50:05] <impatient> to filter the matched set?
[11:50:19] <impatient> based on a unary predicate or some such
[11:50:37] <jdevel> why not just use a jquery slideshow?
[11:50:50] <jdevel> or write a quick plugin for one
[11:51:07] <jdevel> impatient, yes check documentation
[11:51:21] <jdevel> search filter
[11:51:21] <impatient> I'm trying
[11:51:40] <jdevel> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:51:53] <impatient> haha
[11:51:56] <impatient> thanks man
[11:51:59] <jdevel> n/p
[11:52:15] <impatient> who would have guessed it would have actually been called "filter"
[11:52:18] <impatient> hehe
[11:52:24] <jdevel> amazing!
[11:52:35] <impatient> this solution is going to suck tho
[11:52:44] <impatient> gonna need to use filter along with parents
[11:52:50] <impatient> ugly
[11:52:53] <jdevel> you should be able to get what you need from a selector
[11:52:58] <jdevel> you can also use not etc..
[11:53:17] <impatient> not sure how not will help in this case
[11:53:30] <jdevel> read the selector section a little more, well not is like filter.
[11:53:39] <jdevel> not this element..
[11:53:47] <impatient> actually depending on the impl "not" may be ok
[11:53:47] <jdevel> not this element's parent
[11:53:49] <jdevel> etc..
[11:54:10] <impatient> I almost need boolean logic in the selector
[11:54:28] <jdevel> make a fiddle
[11:54:33] <jdevel> and send the link
[11:55:21] <jdevel> i'll check it out.  I'm just waiting for a hurricane to come and clean my windows.
[11:55:27] <impatient> same
[11:55:31] <impatient> very mild now
[11:55:36] <jdevel> indeed
[11:55:43] <impatient> where you located?
[11:55:49] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone know the channel for Flash?
[11:55:52] <JD-Robbs> As in Adobe Flash
[11:56:09] <jdevel> search channel list for "flash"
[11:56:41] <Jamal> Hi, is it possible to get the backgroundcolor of an element using jquery, that i can make an if-statement querying the backgroundcolor?
[11:56:44] <JD-Robbs> Thanks jdevel: What command would that be? :D
[11:57:04] <j_wright>  /list *fash*
[11:57:10] <IgnisDiabolus> Jamal, yes
[11:57:32] <JD-Robbs> Thanks j_wright  :)
[11:58:05] <IgnisDiabolus> you mean var bgcolor = $('#element').css(); ?
[11:58:19] <IgnisDiabolus> oooops. $('#element').css('background-color');
[11:58:21] <Jamal> IgnisDiabolus: How does this work? I tried something like if (jQuery('#id').css("background-color" != "#80FF80"))
[11:58:39] <Jamal> yes
[11:59:02] <imsky> O_O
[11:59:07] <imsky> u r fail
[11:59:26] <Jamal> probably yes :D that's why i'm asking
[11:59:50] <IgnisDiabolus> what? you want to select all elements where background-color != "#80FF80"?
[12:00:01] <imsky> already he's on the road to failure
[12:00:09] <imsky> paved with regret and chocolate ice cream
[12:00:27] <Jamal> No i want to ask if the element has the background-color != "#80FF80"
[12:00:28] <IgnisDiabolus> i like chocolate ice cream
[12:01:10] <IgnisDiabolus> if ($('#element').css('background-color') != "#80FF80") {}
[12:01:13] <imsky> Jamal: $("#element").css("background-color") !== "#80FF80"
[12:01:14] <imsky> BUT
[12:01:20] <imsky> you might have cross-browser problems
[12:01:27] <impatient> yo jdevel, where you located?
[12:02:02] <Jamal> Hm okay, so there is no perfect solution?
[12:02:08] <Jamal> without cross browser problems
[12:02:13] <jdevel> CT at the moment
[12:02:21] <jdevel> moving back to NY soon likely
[12:02:31] <impatient> 6 months into my current, and 1 week before it is supposed to go live, the product owner told us all pages need to look as good in ie8 as every other browser
[12:02:36] <imsky> Jamal: test and see
[12:02:39] <impatient> and that ie8 is the -only- browser the clients will be using
[12:02:42] <jdevel> we will see, If I start working for ESPN I'll stay in CT for a little longer
[12:02:48] <impatient> current project, even
[12:03:43] <impatient> we were using rounded corners, gradients, shadows, etc etc all over the place
[12:05:58] <IgnisDiabolus> <!--[if IE 8]><link to ie 8 css /><![endif]--> ftw! lol

[12:08:47] <impatient> win
[12:17:09] <thnee> doesnt .css('top') return what .css('top', '10px') has set previously?
[12:18:12] <imsky> maybe
[12:18:19] <imsky> what does it return for you, dear stranger
[12:18:53] <thnee> imsky: undefined
[12:19:15] <imsky> hmm
[12:19:18] <imsky> seems fishy
[12:19:30] <thnee> im thinking it can only return whats been set via css?
[12:19:44] <thnee> actual css files that is
[12:21:01] <imsky> thnee: http://jsfiddle.net/eSH7x/
[12:21:12] <imsky> you're doing something wrong chief

[12:40:58] <soapyillusions> is there a specific jQuery UI channel?
[12:41:05] <jdevel> yep
[12:41:13] <jdevel> #jqueryui-dev
[12:41:39] <soapyillusions> jdevel is that even just for generic UI questions (or only for the jQueryUI devs)
[12:42:08] <jdevel> could probably just ask here
[12:42:11] <MatBoy> mhh, why can't I find a simple jquery php/html server/client script
[12:42:28] <djQuery> soapyillusions: u will have better luck askin here first
[12:43:39] <soapyillusions> I have a div which i set to draggable, and even when setting the zIndex and stack properties, it always floats behind my droppable div (which is absolutely positioned)
[12:43:53] <soapyillusions> when it should be floating on top
[12:44:13] <djQuery> ?demo@ soapyillusions
[12:44:14] <bot-t1> soapyillusions, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:44:48] <djQuery> soapyillusions: do they start in different containers?
[12:45:08] <soapyillusions> djQuery yes they are different containers
[12:45:32] <djQuery> soapyillusions: isnt z-index relative to the container
[12:45:57] <jdevel> also make sure both elements are using z-index
[12:46:41] <soapyillusions> jdevel will do, but there are many elements on the page, do I need to set a z-index on everything
[12:47:06] <jdevel> I don't believe so
[12:47:19] <jdevel> the max z-index is the max of a 32 bit int...
[13:04:14] <soapyillusions> if anyone wants to help with the jQuery zIndex thing I have uploaded my test HTML to dropbox at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1695666/wavo-ui-test/index.html

[13:12:08] <Cenk> hi
[13:12:33] <Cenk> a
[13:23:45] <_Cory> Hello
[13:25:00] <_Cory> I didn't know there was a jQuery channel or I would have connected LONG AGO!!!!
[13:25:34] <ThePendulum> You didn't? :O
[13:25:40] <ThePendulum> It's the most obvious channel :O
[13:25:47] <ThePendulum> Welcome :)
[13:25:53] <_Cory> TY
[13:26:25] <_Cory> So do people help each other here a lot regarding jQuery or is this more of a hang out channel
[13:26:46] <ThePendulum> Well there's a lot of silence really, but most of the actual words regard jQuery
[13:26:48] <Deafgoose> http://pastebin.com/9ReMKKGt Why if my form submission doing a GET on firebug isntead of POST?
[13:27:11] <ThePendulum> I was wondering... what is the jquery equivalent of --document.getElementById("somebutton").innerHTML = "Hide";-- ?
[13:27:44] <_Cory> Does your FORM specify POST
[13:27:50] <Deafgoose> u want to hide the whole tag?
[13:28:09] <ThePendulum> No? I want to get <button>Hide</button>
[13:28:13] <ThePendulum> It says innerHTML hehe :P
[13:28:21] <Deafgoose> _Cory no
[13:28:27] <Deafgoose> nothing specified in the tag
[13:28:30] <Deafgoose> <form>
[13:28:52] <_Cory> When I use .submit() I still add method=post
[13:29:03] <_Cory> or else defaults to get
[13:29:12] <Deafgoose> let me add it and see
[13:29:24] <_Cory> dont forget action ='?'
[13:30:07] <Deafgoose> <form action="" method="post"  id="main_form" NAME="main_form">
[13:30:14] <_Cory> I do it all the time and it works for me
[13:30:15] <Deafgoose> thats what I have
[13:30:31] <_Cory> got to have action = '?'
[13:31:01] <_Cory> some browsers hate action=''
[13:31:12] <Deafgoose> strange
[13:31:14] <Deafgoose> <form action="?" method="post"  id="main_form" NAME="main_form">
[13:31:14] <_Cory> will never forward in some browsers without it
[13:31:18] <Deafgoose> still shows as GET on firebug
[13:31:35] <_Cory> are you using php to receieve?
[13:31:36] <ThePendulum> I want the content of my <button> to change when I click it hehe
[13:31:41] <Deafgoose> yea
[13:31:53] <Deafgoose> I can see all values submitted but they are on the querystring
[13:31:57] <_Cory> see if it is coming in unser $_POST or $_GET
[13:32:10] <_Cory> forebug might just not be showing ti correctly
[13:32:39] <Deafgoose> strange code almost similar to on jquery site, overthere shows as POST just fine
[13:32:46] <Kamakazi> Is is considered poor form to use JS/JQuery as a sort of templating method by using scripts to generate HTML for things like menus on all pages?
[13:33:17] <_Cory> I wouldnt do it this way
[13:34:11] <_Cory> simple because I usually do too many things pre-submit, like validate and manipulate form css
[13:34:33] <_Cory> Never get to use serialize
[13:34:36] <_Cory> hehehehe
[13:34:57] <_Cory> brb
[13:43:32] <dave_h_d> hi all, my jquery ui accordion does not seem to work after I update the elements elements dynamically using append, anyone else come across this?
[13:46:01] <Deafgoose> still doing a get, what the heck? http://pastebin.com/fw5PDYeP
[13:46:04] <_Cory> yep, dont remember what I did
[13:47:01] <_Cory> I can show you what I di
[13:47:05] <_Cory> what I do
[13:47:10] <Deafgoose> sure :0
[13:47:34] <Deafgoose> I mean, the data is getting submiteed ok, however I want to do it via post, cant make sense of this
[13:47:53] <_Cory> Yeah, I only use post myself
[13:47:57] <_Cory> and what I do works
[13:49:00] <_Cory> lety me find it
[13:49:12] <Deafgoose> sure :D
[13:49:13] <ThePendulum> How, in jQuery, can I check if a div is slided down (slideDown) or not?
[13:53:37] <_Cory> making a pastebin account to do this
[13:56:43] <_Cory> Almost ready
[13:58:42] <dave_h_d> dave_h_d: I found that if one destroys the accordion just before creating it, it works :-)
[14:05:08] <_Cory> http://pastebin.com/4Q6VcTnB
[14:06:09] <Deafgoose> lots of code :D
[14:06:24] <_Cory> I have cut this out
[14:06:35] <_Cory> this is the smaller versionj
[14:07:02] <Deafgoose> ;)
[14:12:26] <_Cory> So basically cut it out of a very huge application of mine
[14:12:46] <_Cory> I left just enough so you can grasp the method and why I dont use serializer
[14:12:49] <_Cory> hehehehe
[14:13:36] <_Cory> and I noticed I dont have action='?' I use action = ''
[14:13:45] <_Cory> hehehehe I correct myself
[14:13:58] <_Cory> Guess I went off half cocked there
[14:14:05] <_Cory> :) hehehe
[14:16:17] <Deafgoose> :)
[14:16:22] <Deafgoose> I think I figured out my fproblem
[14:18:31] <trebi> hi here, I have a issue with .animate() function. I need to move element from left to right side of the page, and when it reaches a side I want to start the animation again. So result is infinite movement from left to right. How could I do that?
[14:19:18] <ThePendulum> I'd say a method to do that would be a timer that retriggers the animation after it should be done
[14:19:30] <ThePendulum> But I have no idea what options jQuery offers for looping
[14:21:00] <trebi> ThePendulum: I think I will definitely need some callback function to determinate for example a width of page
[14:22:58] <trebi> now I have googled that looping should be possible with jquery.timers.js extention
[14:28:32] <gbgallardo> Where can I ask jQTouch questions?
[14:29:59] <ThePendulum> http://pastebin.com/VSni5X3z --> http://94.228.211.26/tryout/jquery -->  I was wondering, why won't it change the buttons inner html back to Show? :O
[14:32:35] <razzi> ThePendulum, probably because switch is a local variable and loses value when the function ends
[14:32:50] <ThePendulum> Touch√©
[14:33:21] <razzi> you can leave out the var keyword, to see if that's the case
[14:33:26] <ThePendulum> well, I just did
[14:33:29] <ThePendulum> and now it won't change at all
[14:34:19] <razzi> ThePendulum, put the code in jsfiddle
[14:34:27] <ThePendulum> allright
[14:35:20] <ThePendulum> Do I need to split up the code manually?
[14:35:36] <razzi> probably not
[14:36:16] <ThePendulum> I think I do, not sure how else to get the javascript in 'javascript'
[14:40:55] <ThePendulum> How am I supposed to get my page into jsfiddle?
[14:41:02] <razzi> ThePendulum, never mind jsfiddle
[14:41:11] <razzi> just debug your script using console.log()
[14:41:42] <ThePendulum> There aren't any bugs
[14:41:57] <ThePendulum> It just doesn't do what I want it to do lol
[14:42:11] <ThePendulum> But that doesn't nessecarily mean there code itself is wrong as code
[14:42:25] <razzi> using console.log() you can monitor values of variables
[14:42:30] <razzi> and you will understand what is happening
[14:42:52] <ThePendulum> how do I need to implement console.log?
[14:44:13] <razzi> for example, console.log(switched); will print the value of the switched variable to console
[14:44:26] <_Cory> deafgoose, find it?
[14:44:50] <_Cory> Not sure what is causing it but the solution is pretty straight forward
[14:45:33] <ThePendulum> somehow jsfiddle behaves differently than my original page
[14:45:43] <RandalSchwartz> I'm mucking with datatables.net
[14:45:52] <RandalSchwartz> I presume ther's not a good irc for that
[14:45:59] <RandalSchwartz> so I have a few questions that maybe I can ask here.
[14:46:30] <RandalSchwartz> is there a general way to get from the "this" in a bind event back to the datatable object related to it?
[14:47:03] <RandalSchwartz> or do I need to set that up as a closure variable when I create the event?
[14:48:51] <razzi> ThePendulum, try this ..
[14:48:55] <razzi> http://pastebin.com/prjU1Ksx
[14:48:57] <a111> Anyone got IE 9 installed?
[14:50:10] <ThePendulum> http://jsfiddle.net/DgGrp/ <-- got it working
[14:50:13] <ThePendulum> ah let me see your pastebin razzi
[14:51:11] <_Cory> Your hide does not go back to show
[14:53:19] <ThePendulum> _Cory: That's exactly my issue lol
[14:54:55] <ThePendulum> Got it working thanks to razzi, thanks :)
[14:55:46] <_Cory> ohhh hehehe
[14:55:56] <_Cory> ok I will take a look then
[14:56:02] <ThePendulum> 1 more thing though
[14:56:03] <ThePendulum> http://94.228.211.26/tryout/jquery
[14:56:12] <ThePendulum> As you can see, it makes a little 'hop' after the animation is done
[14:56:14] <_Cory> I have done that before
[14:56:14] <ThePendulum> Does anyone know why?
[14:56:29] <_Cory> it is tricky
[14:56:30] <ThePendulum> well I just started with jQuery so I'm sorry for my sillyness :P
[14:56:41] <ThePendulum> the button works now though
[14:56:57] <_Cory> the problem is that the text does not update?
[14:57:16] <_Cory> ohhh ok
[14:57:20] <_Cory> I see you fixed it
[14:57:22] <ThePendulum> Got it exactly how I like now :)
[14:57:23] <_Cory> never mind
[14:57:24] <ThePendulum> Yes
[14:57:31] <ThePendulum> The hopping was because of <p>
[14:57:39] <ThePendulum> Thanks for considering to help though! :)
[14:57:45] <_Cory> yw
[14:58:05] <_Cory> the way I do it is chaining 2 toggles
[14:58:25] <ThePendulum> Well it's fairly simple now I know how
[14:58:29] <ThePendulum> And it only requires 1 toggle
[14:58:45] <_Cory> heheh 1 toggle is the hard way
[14:58:48] <_Cory> hehehe
[14:58:56] <_Cory> but it works and that is all that matter
[14:59:40] <_Cory> swhat I do is make 2 object each with a double toggle reversed of each other with callbacks hiding the other element
[15:00:18] <_Cory> but that whats fun about programming, there is more than one way to skin a cat so to speak
[15:01:25] <_Cory> You are taking a single element and updating its text, as opposed to 2 seperate elements that hide/visible each other upon toggle
[15:01:53] <ThePendulum> It's just what you prefer I guess
[15:02:01] <_Cory> yup
[15:02:05] <ThePendulum> And like you said indeed
[15:02:06] <_Cory> all the same to the user
[15:02:11] <ThePendulum> There's more than 1 way to do it
[15:02:40] <_Cory> I have been programming since I was 11 years old I am not 39
[15:02:47] <ThePendulum> I think this simplier to do than your method though, not sure :P
[15:02:49] <_Cory> oops
[15:02:53] <_Cory> I am NOW 39
[15:02:54] <ThePendulum> What are you if you're not 39?
[15:02:55] <ThePendulum> oh
[15:03:04] <ThePendulum> LOL I was like, okay you're not 39 then :P
[15:03:06] <ThePendulum> hehe
[15:03:08] <_Cory> hehehe
[15:03:11] <ThePendulum> That's a long history of programming
[15:03:20] <ThePendulum> 28 years
[15:03:23] <_Cory> I make those same typos in my code
[15:03:25] <razzi> did you start on the c64?
[15:03:30] <_Cory> yup
[15:03:35] <ThePendulum> You must have programmed BASIC like a boss
[15:03:35] <RandalSchwartz> I started when I was 9.  Now I'm 49
[15:03:40] <razzi> basic and assembler?
[15:03:50] <ThePendulum> What was there to program in 1971?
[15:04:06] <_Cory> yeah, just about every function in PHP I already wrote 25 years ago
[15:04:18] <ThePendulum> I started when I was 11 as well
[15:04:20] <ThePendulum> Now I'm 15
[15:04:22] <ThePendulum> :P
[15:04:23] <RandalSchwartz> HP2000C Time Shared BASIC on a HP2100 system
[15:04:24] <_Cory> hehehe
[15:04:44] <RandalSchwartz> And OMSI Pascal on the PDP 11/45
[15:04:50] <_Cory> HOWEVER, i just started PHP and Javascript a little over 1 year ago
[15:05:02] <jdevel> ThePendulum, thats about when at&t developed unix
[15:05:04] <ThePendulum> dad just walked in, he was all like 'in my time you didn't have such thing as if/else, there was only if-then'
[15:05:05] <ThePendulum> lol
[15:05:07] <RandalSchwartz> PHP is evil
[15:05:11] <_Cory> and getting more into javascript now thanks to jquery
[15:05:39] <_Cory> and I am still not quite got the hang of javascript
[15:05:41] <RandalSchwartz> AT&T didn't do unix
[15:05:42] <jdevel> I started coding around 12 also, but now I'm 28
[15:05:43] <RandalSchwartz> it was bell labs
[15:05:45] <_Cory> wow is that stuff difficult
[15:05:47] <ThePendulum> I started with web development at primary school, when we had to make websites (with Word D:)
[15:05:51] <ThePendulum> and I really liked it
[15:06:04] <ThePendulum> I really wish the school still had those pages somewhere
[15:06:13] <RandalSchwartz> I know... I rewrote those manpages numerous times
[15:06:21] <ThePendulum> I mean, they're nothing about coding
[15:06:26] <ThePendulum> But I'd love to see my very first page haha
[15:06:31] <jdevel> Randal, at&t is bell labs
[15:06:34] <_Cory> Right now I am learning to put all my stuff into jQuery pligins
[15:06:45] <RandalSchwartz> AT&T owns bell labs now.
[15:06:52] <RandalSchwartz> but back then... it was a separate business unit
[15:07:06] <RandalSchwartz> regulatory requirement
[15:07:41] <RandalSchwartz> three arms: unregulated research, unregulated for profit, and regulated
[15:07:51] <razzi> i started programming in 1825
[15:07:56] <ThePendulum> lol
[15:07:57] <_Cory> hehehee
[15:08:07] <RandalSchwartz> bell labs, at&T, and bell system
[15:08:11] <_Cory> 1 block and 2 blocks
[15:08:23] <RandalSchwartz> or maybe of them was wester something
[15:08:30] <_Cory> or... 1 pebble and 2 pebbles
[15:08:34] <jdevel> bell labs was renamed at&t apparently
[15:09:06] <jdevel> in the early 80's
[15:09:06] <RandalSchwartz> wetern electric
[15:09:19] <RandalSchwartz> right - but when unix was developed, it wasn't at&t :)
[15:09:41] <_Cory> I went to school for electronics, and thanks to the c64 I understood memory mapping, and as a result I figured out how to build a prototype calculator
[15:09:46] <jdevel> ok, got me on a technical point
[15:09:51] <_Cory> was a lot of fun
[15:09:59] <jdevel> more or less same folks though
[15:10:14] <_Cory> nice to see I am talking to fellow pros
[15:10:28] <_Cory> was afraid this was a place for all newbies
[15:10:43] <_Cory> I am looking for advanced help
[15:11:29] <_Cory> As you know yourself, after learning your 12th language you realize they are all very close to each other
[15:11:40] <_Cory> HOWEVER, this javascript sits all by its self
[15:12:08] <ThePendulum> I feel insulted.
[15:12:25] <RobertV> when you've got a property name 'background-color' how do you access it using dot notation?
[15:12:42] <_Cory> insulted?
[15:12:53] <ThePendulum> <_Cory> was afraid this was a place for all newbies
[15:13:01] <_Cory> hehehehehe
[15:13:08] <_Cory> Ohh come on
[15:13:08] <ThePendulum> All of you have 40 years of experience
[15:13:11] <RandalSchwartz> can I easily get from $(this) to the form to set up a submit hook?
[15:13:20] <ThePendulum> And I don'te ven have 40 months of experience
[15:13:22] <_Cory> there is nothing wrong with newbies
[15:13:23] <ThePendulum> *don't even
[15:13:41] <_Cory> I was refering to if this was all 100% newbies
[15:13:59] <_Cory> and its not, just saying that is a good thing
[15:14:05] <ThePendulum> You still see me as the counter percentage of the non-noobies rotfl
[15:14:09] <_Cory> not just for me, but for you too
[15:14:24] <ThePendulum> Yeah it helps if it's not just people asking for help, but as well some people offering it
[15:14:35] <_Cory> someone with 5 days cant help someone with 3 days
[15:14:50] <_Cory> got to have the experts around or we learn nothing
[15:14:52] <RandalSchwartz> s ithere an idiom for that
[15:15:05] <_Cory> yes there is
[15:15:14] <_Cory> but I am sure there is rules
[15:15:17] <_Cory> hehehehe
[15:15:50] <ThePendulum> Well there's some stuff I learned within 5 days and thought kids who still didn't get it after 3 days :)
[15:15:57] <_Cory> I have been in the dumb helping dumber and you get nowhere fast
[15:16:33] <_Cory> then good for you, that means you have the talent then
[15:16:40] <Kamakazi> lol
[15:16:44] <ThePendulum> Well, usually you teach what you learned in the 2 days advantage you have lol
[15:17:01] <_Cory> thats what I did in el;ectronics class
[15:17:21] <_Cory> after the teachers lesson, I went around help all the other people inthe class
[15:17:31] <_Cory> by the time I was done, I never needed to study
[15:17:36] <RandalSchwartz> nay ideas?
[15:17:36] <savid> How do I specify multiple attribute selectors in the same selector?  For example, I want  something like "input[type=hidden,name^=_id]"  (but that doesn't seem to work)
[15:17:37] <_Cory> \was already lock in
[15:17:44] <RandalSchwartz> ay that is?
[15:17:47] <ThePendulum> So
[15:17:51] <_Cory> easy
[15:17:55] <ThePendulum> Anyone who feels like contributing to my project? :O
[15:18:16] <ThePendulum> I don't have a budget to hire the pro pro's, so perhaps there are some bored people around
[15:18:42] <_Cory> input[type=hidden],input[name=id]
[15:18:47] <Kamakazi> might need more information than that there ThePendulum
[15:19:09] <RandalSchwartz> do I ned to attach the .submit event to the .form element?
[15:19:22] <ThePendulum> Kamakazi: http://www.aeaprojects.com/
[15:19:46] <ThePendulum> That's a mirror of the actual development site, I dedicated it to the project
[15:19:47] <_Cory> jQuery('#FORMID').submit()
[15:20:05] <ThePendulum> Well not really a mirror, more of a back-up & tryout server
[15:20:17] <ThePendulum> And it explains the very basic concept
[15:20:31] <RandalSchwartz> e asbove
[15:20:33] <RandalSchwartz> see above
[15:20:43] <RandalSchwartz> given $(this), an element *within* a form
[15:20:45] <_Cory> I am working on a very huge project of my own, been working on it for 1.5 years now
[15:20:55] <RandalSchwartz> what is the .submit(...) idiom
[15:21:02] <Kamakazi> _Cory: Dang
[15:21:51] <ThePendulum> What is the project about _Cory?
[15:22:00] <_Cory> I am working on a internet desktop style, applicastion platform for future applications that includes in-hacking security
[15:22:12] <_Cory> I call it the anti-hack(inator)
[15:22:16] <_Cory> hehehe
[15:22:36] <_Cory> basically it is a platform
[15:22:54] <_Cory> with probably the most secury and complex login system
[15:23:00] <razzi> RobertV, you mean a css property?
[15:23:24] <htoothrot> most secure + most complex (huh??)
[15:23:40] <ThePendulum> Sounds like a service where you forget your password, and never be able to use it again
[15:23:48] <ThePendulum> (the service)
[15:24:28] <_Cory> its a platform that accepts plugins as classes
[15:24:29] <ThePendulum> But let me know when you're done :)
[15:24:50] <RandalSchwartz> no idea?
[15:25:07] <ThePendulum> Does anyone know if I can use a jQuery toggle with a different animation?
[15:25:21] <_Cory> just like WP
[15:26:02] <_Cory> I cant really even being to explain it
[15:26:12] <_Cory> it is just so huge I dont know where to start
[15:26:15] <_Cory> jhehjehehe
[15:26:32] <_Cory> and most of it is a secrete for now anyway
[15:26:50] <RandalSchwartz> any thoughts?
[15:27:17] <ThePendulum> Kamakazi: Any interest in the project?
[15:27:19] <savid> Is there a way to "pre-compile" a jquery object for later use?  That is,  I have a complex jquery object built using .not(), etc. that I'd like to use on different parent nodes.  Is there a way to do that?
[15:27:27] <_Cory> I can tell you this... I met some real hackers, not people who figured out where the on switch is, but real hackers
[15:27:45] <RandalSchwartz> hackers as in good or bad?
[15:27:54] <_Cory> they have been assisting me in developing my ghosted user instance identifier
[15:27:57] <razzi> savid .. var $divs = $('div');
[15:27:59] <_Cory> bad ones
[15:28:11] <RandalSchwartz> those are crackers, not hackers
[15:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> please don't taint the term
[15:28:18] <_Cory> ones that should be in jail but are too good to get caught
[15:28:55] <_Cory> basically we sat down and designed  communicatino process that stops them in their tracks
[15:29:06] <ThePendulum> Hackers which get caught often get the oppertunity to work for the government
[15:29:15] <_Cory> getting ready for a live test here next week
[15:29:18] <ThePendulum> *who
[15:29:23] <savid> razzi,  yeah but say I have  var $divs = $('div.child'),   and I want to get all elements that match $divs ?
[15:29:26] <RandalSchwartz> "Hackers" aren't doing things to get caught.
[15:29:29] <RandalSchwartz> *crackers* are
[15:29:31] <_Cory> brb
[15:29:34] <RandalSchwartz> please stop pissing on the term "hackers"
[15:29:39] <ThePendulum> Well I'm sorry then :P I meant crackers
[15:29:39] <savid> razzi, or,  all "p" that match divs
[15:29:46] <razzi> savid .. huh?
[15:29:48] <ThePendulum> To my, 'crackers' are those things I might eat during breakfast
[15:30:12] <RandalSchwartz> hacker just means good.  not illegal
[15:30:15] <ThePendulum> *to me
[15:30:27] <RandalSchwartz> please stop using the term to mean criminal
[15:30:35] <ThePendulum> Well I'm sorry sir :\
[15:31:17] <RandalSchwartz> some hackers are criminal.  CRiminal hACKERS are called "crackers"
[15:31:24] <razzi> no
[15:31:45] <razzi> crackers crack software protections, hackers penetrate into systems
[15:32:01] <razzi> that was what it used to mean originally
[15:32:04] <RandalSchwartz> no.  you are confused.
[15:32:12] <RandalSchwartz> hackers didn't originally mean "penetrate"
[15:32:22] <RandalSchwartz> hackers meant "understand the system real well"
[15:32:38] <razzi> then people who wrote regular code thought they were cool and started calling themselves hackers
[15:32:53] <RandalSchwartz> razzi you are confused
[15:32:59] <RandalSchwartz> I was *there*
[15:33:03] <RandalSchwartz> I know better
[15:33:07] <razzi> lol, and i wasn't?
[15:33:14] <RandalSchwartz> apparently not
[15:33:17] <razzi> heh ok
[15:33:39] <RandalSchwartz> take my moniker of "Just another Perl hacker"
[15:33:50] <RandalSchwartz> it *never* implied any kind of criminal activity
[15:33:57] <ThePendulum> Penetrating into systems without approval of the owner of the system is considered illegal in the Netherlands
[15:34:07] <ThePendulum> It's like digital rape.
[15:34:12] <RandalSchwartz> preceding it were things like "Just another Unix hacker"
[15:34:15] <razzi> oh je bent nl
[15:34:41] <RandalSchwartz> anyway - no idea on my query?
[15:34:54] <ThePendulum> Ik ben een nederlander inderdaad :P
[15:34:59] <razzi> what about it randal
[15:35:08] <RandalSchwartz> $(this).nearest('form').submit( ... )?
[15:35:12] <RandalSchwartz> is that the common idion?
[15:35:17] <ThePendulum> Het hele gedoe met Anonymous is ook niet cracken, en toch zitten ze er voor vast of niet?
[15:35:22] <razzi> what are you trying to do?
[15:35:41] <ThePendulum> --> The whole hassle considering the Anonymous team isn't cracking as far as I know, though they are in jail now, aren't they?
[15:35:59] <RandalSchwartz> given a table in $(this), I'm trying to create an onSubmit event handler for the form in which it is located.
[15:36:50] <RandalSchwartz> the table is a datatables.net table specifically
[15:36:55] <RandalSchwartz> if that makes any difference
[15:39:17] <razzi> RandalSchwartz dunno about nearest, but you can use .closest('form')
[15:39:50] <_Cory> Wow, did I start that conversation
[15:39:56] <_Cory> phone rang
[15:41:01] <_Cory> What I think is funny that there are people out there that figure out how to use a right click and call them selves a hacker because they found something new
[15:42:26] <razzi> i find abed in community funny
[15:43:01] <_Cory> Hacker is a person whom "Hacks away at security" searching for loop holes and breaking code be means of inserting code to manipulate different results other than what was intended
[15:43:05] <ThePendulum> I CAN SEE THE SOURCE OF THIS WEBSITE USING CTRL + U. I'M A HACKER (6)
[15:43:19] <RandalSchwartz> _Cory not entirely
[15:43:26] <_Cory> I can go on
[15:43:29] <RandalSchwartz> one of a dozen subsets of what hacker is
[15:43:39] <_Cory> but then again, my goal is not to ba a now it all
[15:43:40] <ThePendulum> RandalSchwartz: I wonder why you're the only one thinking differently about hackers, though still you think you're correct and we're not
[15:43:45] <RandalSchwartz> includes both criminal and white hat activity
[15:44:19] <_Cory> to manipulate different results
[15:44:35] <_Cory> yes
[15:44:45] <ThePendulum> _Cory: You said you have hackers in your team to secure your website, correct?
[15:45:00] <RandalSchwartz> I'm just angry that the white hat hackers keep getting ignored
[15:45:03] <_Cory> well they are consultants
[15:45:19] <_Cory> and o
[15:45:22] <_Cory> no
[15:45:38] <razzi> soon people making a website with dreamweaver will call themselves hackers
[15:45:48] <ThePendulum> Aren't they just developers?
[15:45:48] <RandalSchwartz> since I am absolutely a white-hat hacker
[15:45:53] <_Cory> they are consultants in designing an application that will be online line one day
[15:45:54] <razzi> k-rad h4ck3r
[15:46:09] <ThePendulum> Define white-hat hacker, RandalSchwartz, perhaps I'll understand
[15:46:13] <_Cory> I write my own retail software
[15:46:24] <RandalSchwartz> a hacker who is white-hat.  works for good, not evil.
[15:46:31] <RandalSchwartz> how hard is that to understand?
[15:46:31] <ThePendulum> Well I got that
[15:46:45] <_Cory> that is not trully a hacker then
[15:46:51] <ThePendulum> But when do you work for 'good', what's working for 'good'? Like a company hired you to hack their services to be sure they're quite safe?
[15:46:54] <RandalSchwartz> _Cory  - WRONG
[15:46:54] <razzi> so it is like good and bad witches?
[15:46:56] <RandalSchwartz> that's the point
[15:47:05] <RandalSchwartz> hacker just means "knows the system deeply"
[15:47:10] <_Cory> Yeah I see it
[15:47:12] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't mean "... and is generally evil"
[15:47:20] <ThePendulum> RandalSchwartz: Face it, definitions change as they suffer of time
[15:47:33] <RandalSchwartz> only if you're sloppy about the definitions
[15:47:40] <RandalSchwartz> I'm trying not to be sloppy
[15:47:54] <ThePendulum> RandalSchwartz: If I say I feel 'gay' today, wouldn't you have a strange look at me?
[15:48:02] <RandalSchwartz> not at all :)
[15:48:10] <ThePendulum> I guess you're one of a few
[15:48:13] <_Cory> hacker: who makes innovative customizations or combinations of retail electronic and computer equipment
[15:48:31] <_Cory> hacker: who shares an anti-authoritarian approach to software development now associated with the free software movement
[15:48:42] <_Cory> hacker: a contentious term used in computing for several types of person
[15:48:51] <ThePendulum> RandalSchwartz: It's not about the exact definition of a word, you should be able to tell what we mean by the context
[15:49:05] <_Cory> This primarily concerns unauthorized remote computer break-ins via a communication networks such as the Internet
[15:49:10] <RandalSchwartz> as long as you don't exclude white-hats from hackers, I'm ok
[15:49:33] <_Cory> but also includes those who debug or fix security problems (White hats),
[15:49:38] <ThePendulum> If we say "the hackers that took down google", you shouldn't think like "oh my god they're thinking I'm evil because I hack as well"
[15:50:00] <RandalSchwartz> see - why wouldn't you just say "the clever people who took down google"
[15:50:02] <RandalSchwartz> it's the same thing
[15:50:04] <_Cory> So he is right
[15:50:06] <RandalSchwartz> but doesn't keep tainting hackers
[15:50:13] <_Cory> he is absolutely right
[15:50:17] <ThePendulum> That seems like we approve of them
[15:50:24] <ThePendulum> Which we most likely don't
[15:50:33] <RandalSchwartz> you *should* approve of "hackers"
[15:50:40] <RandalSchwartz> since there's no morality in that
[15:50:43] <ThePendulum> I'm not talking about exact definition, more about the impression a word makes in a certain sentence
[15:50:47] <RandalSchwartz> you should *not* approve of criminals
[15:50:59] <RandalSchwartz> which the people who took down google clearly are
[15:50:59] <ThePendulum> Never mind, I guess I'm just a fool
[15:51:11] <RandalSchwartz> just stop tainting "hacker" as "evil", and we'll get along
[15:52:05] <RandalSchwartz> now - back to my query
[15:52:09] <ThePendulum> Look, "the hackers.." <-- that's not the defining the evilness of hackers. ".. who took down google" <-- THAT is defining those specific hackers are evil
[15:52:44] <RandalSchwartz> ThePendulum - if I said "the germans who took down google"
[15:52:53] <RandalSchwartz> don't you think that'd reflect badly on germans
[15:52:59] <ThePendulum> No
[15:53:02] <RandalSchwartz> since I called them out specifically for their nationality
[15:53:14] <ThePendulum> I'd think of a bunch of German people who are evil, but only those who took down Google
[15:53:14] <RandalSchwartz> well - I do
[15:53:25] <RandalSchwartz> if it doesn't matter that it's german, *don't say german*
[15:53:50] <RandalSchwartz> it's just "the people who took down google"
[15:53:55] <RandalSchwartz> no need to mention hackers.
[15:54:09] <ThePendulum> In that case, 'people' would be evil, if I would apply your theory
[15:54:30] <RandalSchwartz> but "all people" can't be evil, by definition
[15:54:32] <RandalSchwartz> so it's safe
[15:55:18] <ThePendulum> Look, 'hackers' are people who make a specific piece of software act like it was not intended by their developers and programmers. It doesn't matter if you're hired by the company to do just that or you're not, you still do the same. That's why 'hackers' is the best word to use in such sentence. The rest of the context will tell if those specific hackers mentioned were evil or not
[15:55:51] <RandalSchwartz> ThePendulum - hackers includes a broader definition than that
[15:56:00] <RandalSchwartz> basically it's the equivalent of "uber-clever"
[15:56:25] <RandalSchwartz> any better ideas about my query?
[15:56:29] <RandalSchwartz> or should I just walk away
[15:57:05] <RandalSchwartz> must .submit() be called only on a $('form') element?
[15:57:29] <RandalSchwartz> and if so, given an enclosed table, what's the easiest way to get to the encloding form?
[15:57:37] <Fonzerelli> Hi
[16:00:48] <ThePendulum> Hey
[16:07:12] <_Cory> WHat I didnt know is that when you leave a primary key in either a cookie or a session file, a hacker ghosting a session state uses the server side data to browser accounts unauthorized
[16:07:57] <_Cory> I mean I kinda knew but I didn't realize how hacking into websites was simply that easy
[16:08:17] <djQuery>  RandalSchwartz: by default yes.
[16:08:37] <_Cory> thus causing extream measures needed to be taken as PHP sessions is an open book for hackers
[16:08:41] <djQuery> but you can add custom triggers to other items they just wont be called automaticaly
[16:11:10] <_Cory> Let's put it this way.. if you write a web app that you create a session state after a successfull password match and only rely on php sessions, your site is simple playground for even amature hackers
[16:12:46] <_Cory> All they do is get your IP and mirror your firewall or router, and now the server has NO IDEA who is who
[16:13:07] <ThePendulum> Lots of sites relay on it though
[16:13:21] <_Cory> The server doesnt even know that there is actually 2 computers accessing the one account
[16:13:26] <_Cory> yup
[16:13:29] <ThePendulum> Not sure of sessions work with IP though
[16:13:30] <_Cory> scarry isint it
[16:13:58] <ThePendulum> I thought they created a cookie, and then match the content of the cookie to one stored on the server
[16:14:12] <_Cory> In my application I create my own session state, session id, and per-click authorization tokens
[16:14:31] <ThePendulum> That's how the framework I'm using works as well I think
[16:14:54] <_Cory> yeah, you have to if you want any kind of security
[16:14:57] <_Cory> however
[16:15:10] <ThePendulum> But I seriously doubt sessions work with IP
[16:15:11] <_Cory> HOWEVER, lots of the systems out there now are still hackable
[16:15:16] <ThePendulum> True
[16:15:20] <_Cory> because they make the mistake of ...
[16:15:46] <_Cory> saving any information in session that points to what is needed to authorize a transaction
[16:15:53] <djQuery> _Cory: easy enough to store last access ip
[16:16:03] <_Cory> these are little things the hackers at large have already gotten around
[16:16:15] <_Cory> nope
[16:16:24] <_Cory> it is your IP they are mirring
[16:16:29] <_Cory> mirroring
[16:16:37] <ThePendulum> I wonder why it doesn't work the way I thought it worked then
[16:16:48] <djQuery> _Cory: just catchin up on the convo
[16:16:51] <jdevel> you kidding, I picked up a project the other day because I exposed authentication bypass by poorly handled cookies
[16:17:01] <ThePendulum> Also, if it would be IP based, why wouldn't 2 browsers be logged in at the same time?
[16:17:07] <ThePendulum> If I log in using chrome, I'm not logged in in Firefox
[16:17:10] <_Cory> ghosted users look 100% identical to each other
[16:17:11] <jdevel> I was able to enumerate through the whole user database by manipulating cookies
[16:17:28] <_Cory> in my system ....
[16:17:39] <_Cory> if you login again you get kicked from the other
[16:17:47] <_Cory> same browser or not
[16:18:01] <djQuery> _Cory: if you look hard enoguh no one looks exactly the same. the browser capabilities that you can snif out about form a fingerprint for each machine
[16:18:06] <_Cory> and even if you get in, without a login by mirroring you get kicked
[16:18:39] <_Cory> What fingure print?
[16:18:47] <_Cory> fingerprint?
[16:19:08] <jdevel> it's basically a description of the machine pinned down by collecting values from the client
[16:19:13] <djQuery> some stupid bank was caught just a few months ago exposing all acounts simply by loging in as regular user then changing the url parameters
[16:19:32] <jdevel> gotta be joking..
[16:19:34] <_Cory> that is just plain design stupidity
[16:19:35] <jdevel> a bank?
[16:19:48] <_Cory> see in my platform
[16:20:00] <_Cory> each user has a level, status and ID
[16:20:00] <jdevel> you would actually be surprised how many developers just don't know much about security
[16:20:22] <_Cory> and every click has 5 encrypted tokens each with different expiring times
[16:20:58] <_Cory> not only does the request has to match the token int he end, but every request requires a background check
[16:21:04] <jdevel> don't want to overload the system with sessions either.. especially if they are tracked on the server.. big traffic site will go down pretty fast
[16:21:18] <_Cory> meaning you myust be of the right level to even submit a url command
[16:21:35] <_Cory> also he told me this
[16:21:44] <_Cory> when you save IPs in a history
[16:21:54] <_Cory> in the database,m always save them encrypted
[16:22:03] <jdevel> eh
[16:22:04] <_Cory> never store 22.33.44.555 in a database
[16:22:20] <jdevel> of clients or authorized users?
[16:22:28] <_Cory> ebveryting
[16:22:31] <jdevel> also, that wouldn't matter unless you were authenticating based on IP
[16:22:37] <jdevel> then spoofing would be your downfall
[16:22:53] <jdevel> IP doesn't really matter if you ask me
[16:22:58] <_Cory> thats just it, you cannot rely on IP or session ID at all
[16:22:59] <jdevel> I can get yours right now
[16:23:34] <_Cory> when creating a secure session, verifying you IP means nothing
[16:23:45] <_Cory> IP's can be spoofed
[16:23:50] <jdevel> easily
[16:24:19] <_Cory> what I do is every ajax request, send for an authorization request first
[16:24:26] <jdevel> I would just use it as a logging thing for unauthorized activity, however anyone that knows what they are doing is bouncing through some proxies..
[16:24:40] <_Cory> server sends back 5 keys, random encryption, random expire times
[16:25:06] <_Cory> I call it the random revolving encryption
[16:25:46] <_Cory> these keys are sent right back authorizing the click
[16:26:13] <_Cory> and each key is like a que
[16:26:35] <_Cory> if all keys are expired then the transaction is denied
[16:26:45] <_Cory> wrong keys lock the account
[16:27:07] <_Cory> so if a ghosted user clicks a link
[16:27:28] <_Cory> then the real user's keys will be invalid
[16:27:34] <_Cory> anbd vise versa
[16:27:56] <_Cory> 1 ghosted user will only get 1 click in before casught
[16:28:22] <_Cory> took 14 days to write the class that does al of this
[17:50:24] <RobertV> $(elem).hover(enter, null);  // any ideas why enter() gets called on mouse leave? (using a dummy f() instead of null, stops it)
[17:51:52] <RobertV> using .mouseenter() instead...

[18:48:23] <howardgrigg> hey guys,
[18:49:32] <howardgrigg> is anyone able to help me with this http://dcbc.co.nz/binnumbers/form.html it basically works but I'm having issues trying to update the total based on the checked state of the checkboxs
[19:01:57] <alabd> howardgrigg: hi
[19:03:16] <howardgrigg> alabd: afternoon :)
[19:03:55] <alabd> 6:33 am :) afternoon howardgrigg
[19:06:29] <Z3R0> hey guys
[19:09:19] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/FSs4q7S1 is this the right way to add a loader to a lightbox type image viewer?
[19:43:03] <Z3R0> what's the best method to add html elements to a div ? such as inputs? with adding attributes like type="" name="" etc
[19:48:04] <Z3R0> wow chat dead tonight lol
[19:49:39] <IgnisDiabolus> hi Z3R0
[19:49:50] <Z3R0> lol hello
[19:50:22] <IgnisDiabolus> $('<input />').appendTo('div#someID').attr('type','text');
[19:50:28] <IgnisDiabolus> something like that
[19:51:57] <IgnisDiabolus> i think you can do .attr({'type':'text', 'name':'someName', 'id':'someID'});
[19:52:29] <Z3R0> does it have to be append to or can I do
[19:52:42] <Z3R0> $('#some_div').append( // list of items } ?
[19:53:14] <IgnisDiabolus> you can build the string
[19:53:51] <IgnisDiabolus> var s_htmlElements = '<input type="text" /> <div id="something"></div>';
[19:54:18] <IgnisDiabolus> then $('#some_div').html(s_htmlElements); or $('#some_div').append(s_htmlElements);
[19:54:34] <Z3R0> hmmmm
[19:54:45] <Z3R0> ok thanks gave me some ideas now much appreciated
[19:55:02] <IgnisDiabolus> it's best practice to build string first before doing any append. as much as you can
[19:56:02] <Z3R0> well I'm trying to modify a template based on a $.post() of an array of items sent back so I will build them in the *.php and then append to template
[19:56:47] <IgnisDiabolus> yes. that's good. to build first in server-side before returning :3
[19:59:06] <Z3R0> ok time to revamp my entire setup, but this should be better so I don't have to mess with the template now and have multiple view pages
[20:04:59] <savid> How do I build jqueryui from git?
[20:08:55] <savid> there's no makefile, and "ant" doesn't seem to work
[20:11:02] <djQuery> Z3R0: you can even do $('<input>', {type: 'email', 'class': 'email', required: true}).appendTo('#somediv');
[20:11:21] <Z3R0> o.o
[20:11:25] <Z3R0> ah it accepts an array of params
[20:12:31] <djQuery> and dont do .appendTo('div#someID')   if you allready know the id putting div infront it just slows it down
[20:41:11] <howardgrigg> hey guys - can anyone see why the totals are getting messed up if you uncheck the different options http://jsfiddle.net/xzfGP/
[20:46:33] <weswongsf> Hi All.   I have a jquery mobile question.   I guess first off - is there a room dedicated to jquery mobile ?   if this is the best place for a question - then my question is can a users photo library be accessed from a jquery mobile web app ?  if so - how ?
[20:47:19] <jmordica> how do i edit a js file with the jquery ui?
[20:48:06] <jmordica> I notice the ui creates templates on it's own is that right?
[20:52:46] <letterpress> jmordica you don't do that with jquery ui
[20:53:31] <sdwrage> Hey all
[20:53:50] <sdwrage> Anyone know of a solution that checks a form to make sure all fields have been filled out?
[20:54:00] <danzik17> howardgrigg: How are the totals getting messed up?
[20:54:34] <letterpress> sdwrage http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[20:54:40] <Z3R0> danzik17 when he unchecks the tick boxes, they go ape shit lol, but I think I fixed it
[20:55:21] <sdwrage> letterpress, thanks
[20:55:45] <letterpress> just give the inputs a class "required" and run valid()
[20:55:53] <IgnisDiabolus> sdwrage, better to do it in server-side
[20:56:27] <sdwrage> IgnisDiabolus, currently is client side
[20:56:36] <sdwrage> er
[20:56:37] <sdwrage> server side
[20:56:43] <IgnisDiabolus> ok :3
[20:57:02] <sdwrage> using this to stop the user from submitting and going through the hassle :P
[20:57:54] <Asone> Ohai, got a question. I'm generating Ids on HTML elements, so i get a list like : main_red, main_blue, main_violet. With a bind i get the id and stock it in a variable, but i'd like to supress the "main_" to only stay with the second part ( here : red, blue or violet ). Does anyone know how i can do that ?
[20:58:02] <howardgrigg> danzik17: cheers but Z3R0 helped me out in a private message
[20:58:48] <Z3R0> ^_^
[20:58:56] <Z3R0> so happy I was able to actually help someone ^^
[20:59:25] <IgnisDiabolus> Z3R0, how's your code doing? :3
[20:59:35] <Z3R0> ugh, I dunno
[20:59:52] <Z3R0> I have a feeling I'm doing this VERY VERY wrong, but unfortunately it's DOING what I want
[21:00:09] <IgnisDiabolus> i'm looking for a tut on how to do something similar in facebook when you're tagging someone
[21:00:27] <IgnisDiabolus> it autosuggests then autocompletes when you highlight then press enter/tag
[21:00:31] <IgnisDiabolus> s/tag/tab
[21:00:56] <IgnisDiabolus> i'm doing it for a wordpress plugin. do you guys know of something similar?
[21:01:04] <Z3R0> nope not i
[21:01:26] <IgnisDiabolus> ooops. just figured it out in my head. heh. thanks
[21:02:23] <Z3R0> lol gotta love those
[21:05:15] <Z3R0_> sorry guys got frozen
[21:06:51] <letterpress> Asone won't the .replace javascript method work to remove "main_" from the id of the element? perhaps you could paste code somewhere to look at.
[21:07:36] <Asone> pastebining the code
[21:08:49] <Asone> http://pastebin.com/y86RrvHw ( HTML/CSS/JS part ) & http://pastebin.com/vi37FhJp ( XML struct from wich i build the lists...Etc )
[21:09:17] <Asone> the thing is that main_ in some other lists will be another thing
[21:09:32] <Asone> here you have main_ , left_ and right_ lists
[21:09:50] <Asone> so i suppose i should suppress everything before the underscore
[21:10:05] <Asone> but i dunno how to do that, probably with a regex but i'm really not a master at regex
[21:12:09] <Asone> ( with the sample i gave, i get three lists, with three elements in each so we get nine elements : main_rojo, main_violeta, main_azul, left_rojo, left_violeta ....etc
[21:12:51] <letterpress> this makes no sense but var color = $("#main_red").attr("id").replace("main_id","")
[21:12:59] <letterpress> oops
[21:13:16] <letterpress> var color = $("#main_red").attr("id").replace("main_","")
[21:14:01] <Asone> mm'k i see how i must do it
[21:14:04] <Asone> Thanks a lot :)
[21:14:18] <Asone> i'll have to add a few lines more to adapt it but i get it
[21:14:20] <Asone> thanks a lot :D
[21:14:39] <letterpress> np hope that helped‚Ä¶?!?
[21:14:51] <Asone> you win one good karma point :D
[21:16:06] <Asone> ( i'll add a line for getting the parent ID wich always contains lists_thenameofpart (nameofpart here = main, left, right ), stock it in variable and then do another replace like you said
[21:16:09] <Asone> it should works
[21:20:01] <bobbobbins> hey, im using $.ajax with a serialized form, and it works great, but now they
[21:20:30] <bobbobbins> we're adding a file upload field to the form, and that doesn't really work, how do i do file uploads with $.ajax?
[21:24:24] <jmordica> I need to call an event in html. the event is this $('button.register', dialogRegister).click(function(event) {
[21:24:24] <jmordica>                 event.preventDefault();
[21:24:32] <jmordica> this would be an onclick event
[21:24:49] <jmordica> there is also an html page that has the form
[21:25:22] <jmordica> so what else do i need to make this event read the html page a pop up when someone clicks the event?
[21:25:27] <jmordica> using jquery ui
[21:27:11] <jmordica> so <button onclick='button.register', dialogRegister).click(function(event) {>Register Now</button>   ?
[21:27:17] <jmordica> but where does the html go?
[21:36:46] <Asone> letterpress : it worked
[21:36:47] <Asone> be blessed
[21:37:11] <letterpress> yeah! thx.
[21:37:17] <Asone> whatever people can say, jquery is definitely fucking awesome
[21:37:30] <Asone> that's for a shirt customizing system on an online market
[21:37:45] <Asone> like the nike or converse system to create your own shoes
[21:37:52] <Asone> but without shitty flash :D
[21:38:28] <Asone> ( death to flash )
[21:55:49] <Z3R0_> anyone know how I can use "tablesorter" with a live type function? doesn't like dynamic content apparently, and I can't figure out how to make it update after I have parsed the html
[21:58:08] <bobdobbs> how do I set an elements attribute ?
[21:58:27] <Z3R0_> $('#my_id').attr('name','value');
[21:58:36] <Z3R0_> ? attr
[21:58:37] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[21:58:43] <bobdobbs> thanks
[22:26:18] <wreel> if I'm using jquery to output the result of an ajax call where i want to dress up the output with some HTML, I'm assuming that it is more stylistically appropriate to add the html spice on the javascript side, right? this way I can use some APIs rather than write html as text in my code? if this is correct, can someone point me to which API I should use? is it the DOM stuff? thanks!
[22:28:58] <wreel> specifically, i want to render a radio button with some of the output, so i'm looking for some sort of radio constructor which i assume must exist. i just need to know which technology/api to learn about
[22:45:49] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/FSs4q7S1 is this the right way to add a loader to a lightbox type image viewer?
[22:46:53] <jrockjiggz> Rinthe: i'm not familiar to why your writing your html inside jQuery() object
[22:47:28] <jrockjiggz> normally i would var loader = "<html here>"; then $('#loading').html(loader).load(url)
[22:49:58] <Rinthe> jrockjiggz: whats .load(url)
[22:50:54] <Rinthe> url of what?
[22:55:16] <jrockjiggz> well that is an ajax example
[22:56:04] <jrockjiggz> if you want a loader, i typically use: $('div').html('<div>Loading...</div>').load(url); //url being the content u want to load
[22:56:24] <jrockjiggz> i'm not really answering your question, just giving an alternative
[23:00:27] <rubyontails> http://jsfiddle.net/5CfXt/12/ how can i optimise this code ? it becomes very slow when i have long tables around 1000 trs
[23:02:14] <astropirate> rubyontails, always always always have   var in front of your variable declarations
[23:03:49] <jrockjiggz> rubyontails: i just saved $(this) as a variable so it doesn't have to rescan the DOM everytime. you should see an increase http://jsfiddle.net/5CfXt/13/
[23:07:32] <rubyontails> astropirate: hmm
[23:08:14] <astropirate> rubyontails, if you don't, it will contaminate the window object
[23:08:32] <astropirate> aka the global object
[23:08:33] <rubyontails> hmm
