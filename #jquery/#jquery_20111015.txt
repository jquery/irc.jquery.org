[00:00:01] <snover> good thing itâ€™s late late friday night and everyone else is in a drunken coma, coldhead
[00:00:06] <cypha> cool, it would be great if it has good docs
[00:00:14] <cypha> cuz jquery really had great ones, i thought
[00:00:27] <diverdude> you should go to a chat channel instead
[00:01:39] <snover> they are the unfortunate achilles heel but work is underway to improve them. anyway, #dojo exists, you should go in there or something
[00:01:48] <snover> so I can stop feeling like a bastard
[00:02:10] <cypha> haha
[00:07:08] <coldhead> dojox.jsonquery looks useful
[00:07:54] <domino14> what is the difference between doing function something () { } and var something = function () { Â } Â ?
[00:07:55] <domino14> 12:04
[00:08:18] <snover> domino14: the former is a function declaration and the latter is a function expression
[00:08:47] <snover> the former will be hoisted and always defined for use by all code immediately
[00:09:10] <domino14> what will the latter do?
[00:09:15] <snover> the latter will not be hoisted and so will only be defined once that line of code is actually executed
[00:09:21] <snover> in the order it was written
[00:09:44] <snover> you can use a function expression in conjunction with an if statement, for example, but not a function declaration
[00:10:22] <domino14> oh
[00:10:29] <domino14> so only define the function if some statement is true
[00:10:41] <domino14> is there any reason to do that though?
[00:12:11] <coldhead> if you want to make the function behave differently in different parts of your program maybe?
[00:12:25] <coldhead> you shouldn't worry about it unless you need it
[00:12:34] <coldhead> and if you ever need it: BOO YA
[00:13:17] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[00:13:22] <snover> domino14: conditional definition of functions is extremely useful in conjunction with feature detection, for instance
[00:14:30] <Double_Rainbow> i have a lot of <span> with class name "arrayofcountries". How do i get them in an array and foreach each of them so that i can retreive  their id and html content?
[00:14:35] <Double_Rainbow> thanks
[00:16:48] <coldhead> $('span.arrayofcountries').each(...) ?
[00:16:57] <Double_Rainbow> cool
[00:17:00] <coldhead> i think that would work
[00:17:13] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[00:17:31] <Double_Rainbow> coldhead: really?
[00:17:41] <coldhead> i think so
[00:17:47] <coldhead> i mean it looks valid
[00:17:49] <coldhead> from what i've read
[00:17:56] <coldhead> and experimented with so far
[00:18:01] <Double_Rainbow> i just know jquery for ajax purposes
[00:18:42] <coldhead> yeah the ajax stuff looks really nice
[00:18:52] <coldhead> i'm going to try that later on tonight
[00:19:05] <coldhead> i'll ask you if i have any questions Double_Rainbow
[00:19:29] <Double_Rainbow> i am not the right person for questions coldhead ;)
[00:19:41] <coldhead> HEY I HELPED YOU BUDDY
[00:19:46] <coldhead> QUID PRO QUO
[00:20:06] <Double_Rainbow> coldhead: ok ok, chill out
[00:20:29] <coldhead> sorry, it's been a long day
[00:21:16] <CodeZombie> would someone mind taking a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/YKSZD/1/ I'm getting an odd drift on the dynamic elements when zooming
[00:21:23] <CodeZombie> click the background, to add an element
[00:23:33] <CodeZombie> I notice that when I don't subtract the element width/height when I add it, the element doesn't drift, however, I need to subtract those values to center it on the cursor
[00:28:35] <CodeZombie> *sigh* not an ideal Friday night... That's for certain
[00:34:18] <coldhead> it's a hard problem, CodeZombie!
[00:34:24] <Double_Rainbow> its a zombie and a coder one!
[00:34:38] <Double_Rainbow> do you eat braaaiiinnnns?
[00:34:45] <CodeZombie> apparently, not enough
[00:35:09] <Double_Rainbow> drink coffee, its helps me a lot
[00:35:33] <Double_Rainbow> when i drink coffee, i feel like that guy from the movie Limitless
[00:35:45] <CodeZombie> removed some lint errors : http://jsfiddle.net/YKSZD/2/
[00:50:53] <na3r> hi all
[00:51:10] <na3r> how can i resize image width befor load
[00:51:22] <na3r> here is my code $('#content img:first').width($('#content').width());
[00:51:58] <na3r> but it is resized when image loads completly
[00:52:16] <Double_Rainbow> want an image resizer, why not ZOIDBERG?
[00:52:57] <na3r> Double_Rainbow, what is it?
[00:53:17] <CodeZombie> na3r: I don't think you can work with an object before it loads
[00:53:38] <CodeZombie> you could hide it, resize, and when it finishes loading show it
[00:54:03] <na3r> CodeZombie, nice idea :)
[00:54:18] <CodeZombie> $('#content img:first').load(function() { $(this).width($('#content').width()) }
[00:54:30] <CodeZombie> errr
[00:54:39] <CodeZombie> $('#content img:first').load(function() { $(this).width($('#content').width()); $(this).fadeIn(); });

[01:34:56] <Axsuul> Ok so ajax is reloading a portion of my website that has a javascript include. The website gets slower and slower the more times it reloads and I'm fairly sure it's because of this javascript include.. is there any way to clear the memory or resources?
[01:35:27] <Lochlan> do you have an example?
[01:37:00] <Axsuul> Hmm well, I have a $.getScript(...)
[01:37:04] <Axsuul> and in this script I have something like
[01:37:18] <Axsuul> $('#id').html('<style type="text/javascript" src="..">')
[01:37:58] <Axsuul> Does that make sense? :D
[01:39:12] <NodeX> check if the script is loaded already

[02:00:44] <linusoleander> Is there a way to convert "a=10" into {a: 10} using jQuery?
[02:00:56] <textHtml> http://jsfiddle.net/wgeAA/  in that code, i have a textarea and div, whatever i type in the div its getting reflected into the textarea, but when i type the return key, its not reflecting int the textarea
[02:01:36] <NodeX> linusoleander : there is a plugin to serialize to an object
[02:03:11] <NodeX> and textHtml : id you can't be bothered to setup a proper demo then I can't be bothered to show you the answer :)
[02:05:40] <Axsuul> How would I add a jQuery UI slider to future elements (that are not loaded at the DOM)
[02:05:54] <NodeX> delegate
[02:05:59] <NodeX> ?deletgate
[02:06:00] <bot-t1> NodeX, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[02:06:13] <Axsuul> Ya I looked at delegate but how would that work in my situation
[02:06:18] <Axsuul> what would be the eventType?
[02:06:38] <NodeX> right I get what you mean ..
[02:07:44] <NodeX> try "load" as the event
[02:08:24] <textHtml> NodeX:  what is proper setup?  I placed the css in the css place, is that ok? http://jsfiddle.net/wgeAA/13/
[02:08:54] <NodeX> omg

[02:09:38] <textHtml> http://jsfiddle.net/wgeAA/13/
[02:09:42] <NodeX> wtf
[02:09:47] <NodeX> I just pasted you the answer
[02:09:58] <NodeX> a little tip ... read the docs
[02:10:21] <textHtml> please look int the the updated link, http://jsfiddle.net/wgeAA/13/
[02:10:34] <NodeX> NO
[02:10:42] <NodeX> Look at the ONE I PASTED AS IT HAS THE ANSWER
[02:10:46] <NodeX> ffs
[02:11:17] <NodeX> your updated link is still wrong because you dont read the docs
[02:11:33] <NodeX> Axsuul : load wilol not work
[02:11:37] <NodeX> will not *
[02:12:38] <Axsuul> NodeX: hmm ok, i have a little playground
[02:12:39] <Axsuul> http://jsfiddle.net/MZVXE/
[02:13:28] <NodeX> very weird how the CSS is not inheriting
[02:13:47] <NodeX> err negate that
[02:13:50] <Axsuul> but this is about the same situation as mine
[02:13:53] <NodeX> *bad hangover*
[02:13:59] <Axsuul> except im just trying to add a .slider()
[02:14:29] <NodeX> $("#list").append(...).slider(); ?
[02:15:02] <Axsuul> in my situation im not really appending though
[02:15:14] <Axsuul> basically one part of my site is being reloaded
[02:15:23] <Axsuul> and the sliders need to be readded
[02:15:25] <NodeX> perhaps a js fiddle of your code
[02:19:25] <textHtml> that's very nice NodeX , thanks for it
[02:19:27] <textHtml> bye

[02:58:55] <ura> hi
[02:59:38] <ura> Google CDN prevent caching of jquery, is this right behavior?
[03:00:14] <ura> When GET-ting http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js headers Date and Expires are equal, so script is never cached.
[03:01:47] <ura> It is not behavior that I expect. I want to use CDN to take benefit of this script already being cached. Instead it never get cached resulting in worse performance than store it on server.
[03:05:30] <ravenzz> ura the dont't prevent it
[03:05:37] <ravenzz> they*
[03:07:14] <dabear> ura: it's your browsers fault if its not cached. after reading the if-modified-since header, your browser can abort loading from the server and read from a local cache instead
[03:07:15] <ura> http://nopaste.info/b29e721ab8.html
[03:08:14] <ura> Standard compliant UserAgent does not even try to ask If-Modified-Since on document which is already expired (where Expires <= Date)
[03:08:53] <dabear> ura: well, google returns a  304 not modified
[03:09:42] <ura> dabear, Google will return 304 not modified if it would be asked (there is If-Modified-Header). The problem that useragent does not send if-modified header for expired document.
[03:10:04] <dabear> ura: well, my chrome does
[03:10:16] <ura> google returns date and expires headers with the same value, is this normal?
[03:10:28] <ura> this means that document already expired
[03:11:45] <dabear> use another cdn? :p
[03:12:29] <ura> Or to host it locally :(
[03:14:02] <ura> I googled and I feel that such behavior was not before, Expires header was correct (a year later than current time).
[03:15:07] <ravenzz> ura do you notice the same with http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.6.4.min.js and http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js
[03:15:08] <ravenzz> =
[03:15:12] <ravenzz> ?
[03:16:19] <ura> ravenzz, I tried it with curl --HEAD and headers looks ok, it should be cached. I'll try it in browser right now.
[03:25:34] <ura> ravenzz, Cache is working for microsoft CDN. But caching started to work with google cdn as well after restarting firefox.
[03:27:26] <ura> Nothing changed  with headers, date is still equal to expires but javascript is being cached.
[03:28:29] <ura> It must be some bug with browser. Thanks for help and I'm sorry for bothering for nothing.
[03:29:46] <ravenzz> np, you're welcome
[03:29:46] <NodeX> firefox is notorious for caching
[03:29:51] <ravenzz> ^
[03:29:59] <NodeX> always test caching issues with lynx / curl
[03:30:14] <NodeX> webkit is even worse lol
[03:30:21] <NodeX> dont get me started on IE!
[03:39:16] <ura> Since I don't use disk cache, after restarting firefox cache started from scratch. So it must be there was something wrong with cache, which resolved by restart.
[03:40:55] <ura> Probably cache reached maximum size and for some reason (bug?) it didn't cleaned older stuff but refused to add new.
[03:41:17] <NodeX> Ctrl + shift + R in firefox to unload the cacche
[03:41:19] <NodeX> cache *
[03:48:44] <ura> I knew about shift-<reload> combination, but I thought it just for bypassing cache for one specific time.
[03:50:29] <ura> There was some strange bug, for document from my server If-modified-since was sen, and 304 not modified was received. But for documents hosted on google, requests was sent as with shift-<reload>, without if-modified-since header.
[03:51:13] <ura> Anyway restarting helped, and most important for me that it was just my local bug, and javascript would be cached for users :)
[04:04:07] <Camer0n> if you go here: http://vermilionsite.com/phone/?id=1
[04:04:12] <Camer0n> click the first option
[04:04:18] <Camer0n> then choose a colour
[04:04:25] <Camer0n> then mouse over the image it shows a zoom
[04:04:33] <Camer0n> but the zoom is of the original image, how do i make it so that it is also coloured?
[04:06:07] <ravenzz> Camer0n when you click on the thumbnail (alias when you choose the color) bind the magnify() to the new image
[04:06:27] <Camer0n> sorry, im awful with jquery, how would i do that?
[04:09:07] <ravenzz> you should try with $('.previewImg').attr("src", data).magnify();
[04:09:31] <ravenzz> select3() function
[04:10:24] <DThought> i've got an <TR> element and some of the <TD>s inside are stlyed "display:none"   i need to extract information from them, but $("tr#specified").children("td.mark")  doesn't show them. Is there any way to circumvent this?
[04:10:50] <NodeX> what sort of information ?
[04:11:33] <DThought> NodeX: textContent
[04:12:14] <DThought> the reason i'm hiding the tds is because i'm styling the table to insert "rowspan=3" when appropiate
[04:12:21] <dabear> DThought: do the TDs have a mark class? if so, that should owrk. see also ?paste
[04:12:33] <DThought> dabear: yes, they do
[04:12:42] <dabear> DThought: jsfiddle it
[04:12:47] <dabear> give an example
[04:13:35] <NodeX> even if they are hidden you should be able to get content from them.. the only thing hiding stops is width/height/position
[04:13:48] <DThought> NodeX: thats my understanding...
[04:14:28] <NodeX> best to pastebin ^^ .. it's probably not finding the element
[04:14:33] <NodeX> fiddle sorry*
[04:14:45] <ravenzz> DThought http://jsfiddle.net/2WXsz/
[04:15:16] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/2WXsz/1/
[04:15:43] <DThought> ravenzz: yes.... okay.
[04:16:04] <DThought> I'll recheck my solution, i suspect the error is on my side then
[04:16:05] <DThought> thank you
[04:16:13] <ravenzz> yw
[04:16:14] <DThought> i.e. in generation of that list
[04:16:39] <ravenzz> I dunno, if you need further help you should paste your code somewhere
[04:16:47] <ravenzz> as we can take a look at it
[04:17:39] <ravenzz> we = the mafia :[ lol
[04:17:49] <pootietang> sup peeps!
[04:18:16] <Camer0n> ravenzz > i tried that but it didnt work
[04:18:28] <pootietang> reading the book: jquery enlightment
[04:18:32] <pootietang> it's awesome
[04:18:43] <Camer0n> btw the .magnify bit shouldnt have ever been in there, it should be .loupe
[04:18:48] <Camer0n> but that still doesnt work
[04:18:58] <ravenzz> I have to go
[04:18:58] <ravenzz> sorry
[04:19:07] <Camer0n> anyone else?
[04:19:08] <ravenzz> bbl
[04:19:18] <Camer0n> http://vermilionsite.com/phone/?id=1
[04:19:29] <Camer0n> click the first option
[04:19:34] <Camer0n> then choose a colour
[04:19:38] <Camer0n> then hover over the image
[04:19:53] <Camer0n> it should zoom it but it uses the original image
[04:20:00] <Camer0n> how do i make it so it is coloured?
[04:21:53] <Dreamstar> Hello! How can I get the value of a anchortags title?
[04:24:04] <Dreamstar> Nevermind
[04:24:52] <Camer0n> anyone??
[04:31:57] <michael_mbp> lo
[04:33:32] <michael_mbp> any jquery/JS pro's around?
[04:33:59] <NodeX> Just ask the question .. someone will answer if they can :)
[04:34:49] <michael_mbp> http://jsfiddle.net/ZwY9b/19/  < I want to inject the contents of each JSON object (apart from json[0]) inside <div class="row"><div class="grid_4"> but it needs to close the row so that we have 3 colums.
[04:34:55] <michael_mbp> hey NodeX thanks.
[04:35:48] <michael_mbp> the outer most $.each will later be replaced with a .getJSON call.
[04:36:40] <michael_mbp> NodeX ideas?
[04:37:19] <NodeX> I'll take a look in a min
[04:37:27] <michael_mbp> sure cheers
[04:40:16] <NodeX> you will probably have to make 3 divs and populate them and float them left
[04:41:02] <NodeX> of change your if's() to add some else if's when checking the entryIndex
[04:41:06] <NodeX> or change*
[04:41:57] <NodeX> and I would change the entryIndex to a switch()
[04:46:12] <michael_mbp> mind making the changes?
[04:46:14] <Camer0n> NodeX please have a look at my question?
[04:47:38] <michael_mbp> I guess what you're saying is create the the 3 divs, inject the content into them (they already have the row wrapping around them) ?
[04:50:27] <NodeX> Camer0n : I dont click external links sorry
[04:50:38] <NodeX> apart from fiddle and pastebin
[04:50:43] <Camer0n> oh ok
[04:50:48] <NodeX> michael_mbp : yep
[04:50:56] <NodeX> that would be the safest way
[04:51:39] <michael_mbp> so on each loop it'll output one <div row>... </div> ?
[04:52:12] <NodeX> yes .. but concat the HTML like you are doing as it's much faster to update teh 3 divs at the end of the loop
[04:52:17] <michael_mbp> would be great if you can update the fiddle, I've been fiddling for a while LOL...
[04:52:28] <michael_mbp> right.
[04:52:33] <NodeX> I'm about to go sorry
[04:52:50] <michael_mbp> ok, I'll be here if I'm stuck... probably see you when your back.
[04:52:52] <michael_mbp> thanks.
[04:58:28] <michael_mbp> lol that was easier than expected...WTF
[04:58:45] <michael_mbp> oh wait...not!
[05:05:52] <rgr> I'm looking for some pointers to tutorials/faqs on debugging jquery ajax optimsiation/performance. Some json calls aer taking about 3 seconds when calling to a local php server.

[06:09:11] <sente> V/wg 13
[06:27:37] <namelessjon> If an element is overflowing, is there a way in jquery to find the height of the content? (vs the height of the element)
[06:28:55] <Dreamstar> How can I remove the old title attribute but still have my own styled one?
[06:29:46] <NodeX> namelessjon : the height of the content is the height of the element minus padding
[06:30:51] <namelessjon> NodeX: But when I add content, say inline list items, to a list, they seem to overflow out of the bottom, without the reported $ul.height() changing.
[06:35:20] <dabear> namelessjon: you could copy the contents to a new div that does not have height/width set in css
[06:35:28] <dabear> then calculate the size of that div
[06:37:37] <namelessjon> dabear: Ah, that might work.  I will give that a shot after lunch. Thanks for the suggestion.
[06:38:25] <ravenzz> or just set the height to auto
[06:40:07] <namelessjon> I'd like to have some height initially (even when there are no items there), it's just on the rare occasion it overflows, I don't want it to look bad/make the rest of the page harder to use.
[06:40:51] <ravenzz> can you provide a demo?
[06:41:23] <ravenzz> you could set the overflow to auto, so the scrollbars will appear
[06:44:49] <namelessjon> ravenzz: Yes, I'll put something up on jsbin or so soon.

[06:53:23] <ravenzz> Dreamstar what do you mean?
[06:53:42] <ravenzz> you want to remove the title="" attr and?
[06:53:50] <Dreamstar> have my own tooltip
[06:53:59] <ravenzz> ah
[06:54:07] <Dreamstar> I can show u some code maybe?

[06:54:34] <Dreamstar> will do
[06:56:18] <Dreamstar> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/8azYV/
[06:58:46] <ravenzz> ok
[07:01:47] <namelessjon> ravenzz: Ah, what I wanted was height: auto, but with a min-height specified too.  Thanks for the suggestion :)

[07:03:06] <mikdiet> Hi, which event will start immediately after appearence of element, when I use .live() ?
[07:11:31] <dabear> mikdiet: no such thing

[07:29:00] <oal> Are there any libraries with additional Jquery UI widgets worth checking out? I'm looking for a <select> replacement with support for icons + text <option>s. Suggestions?
[07:32:49] <JackBauer24> oal: check this out: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[07:33:02] <JackBauer24> I'm not sure if it has icon support but it has nice search engine
[07:33:32] <oal> JackBauer24, looks great. Thanks :)
[07:50:06] <Kamakazi> amazing how much work can be done on a Saturday mornining when I wake up at 5AM
[07:52:47] <warrenparsons> JackBauer24: I'm using Chosen on a project right now. It's come in quite handy.
[07:53:25] <JackBauer24> warrenparsons: good to know, because I am about to implement this too
[08:29:57] <abjorn> (10:29:20 AM) poisonarms: just because i dont have a reason for chrome being shit doesnt mean it isnt shit
[08:39:16] <arashtamere> Calling $('#step1').after('<div id="step2"></div>'); if I call $('#step2').offset() right after, then I will get 0,0. But if I wait ~ 500 milliseconds, then I get the correct offset. is there any way to set a callback function for when the .after is "completed"?
[08:39:44] <arashtamere> I tried to add a .bind('load') on #step1 and #step2 but they never actually get called.
[08:43:21] <arashtamere> The Internets says "Regular DOM manipulation events (that is, not .load(), which uses Ajax) are synchronous" but that doesn't seem to be the case
[08:43:53] <billy_> hi
[08:43:58] <billy_> i'm having this wierd problem
[08:44:14] <billy_> i'm trying to make a modal dialog box with jquery
[08:44:23] <billy_> and i've tried these two libraries: fancybox and simplemodal
[08:44:35] <billy_> and in each case, the library doesn't seem to load
[08:44:45] <billy_> as in, the extension methods ($.fancybox and $.modal) don't exist!
[08:44:48] <billy_> can anyone advise?
[08:45:50] <dabear> billy_: can be one of multiple reasons. are you loading jquery twice? are you using $(..).modal() or $.modal? etc
[08:45:57] <dabear> billy_: ?paste
[08:46:11] <dabear> ?paste @ billy_
[08:46:11] <billy_> i'm pretty sure i'm loading jquery once
[08:46:12] <bot-t> billy_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:57:20] <Kamakazi> is there anyway to have a loading indicator over just a certain part of my page while it loads?
[09:35:57] <XCoder> Hi everyone! I'm trying to develop a book-reader website. Anyone an idea on how to calculate the amount of text that fits on a page without a using a scrollbar?
[09:36:04] <callumacrae> How can I change the default fade time for .fadeIn / .fadeOut?
[09:37:39] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: fadeIn(800)
[09:37:51] <callumacrae> "default"
[09:37:55] <eddiemonge> XCoder: check height vs the parent height when overflow is set
[09:38:07] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: why do you want to?
[09:38:47] <callumacrae> Because I have been told that calling .fadeOut(100) every time isn't allowed, and using a constant isn't allowed
[09:39:08] <damjan> can I get to the underlaying XMLHttpRequest instance when doing an $.ajax request?
[09:39:15] <callumacrae> Uh, I'm not talking in general here
[09:39:27] <callumacrae> It isn't allowed on this project
[09:39:27] <callumacrae> xD
[09:39:49] <Krinkle> damjan: $.ajax( â€¦ ) returns an instance of jqXHR
[09:40:10] <Krinkle> jqXHR is a normalized (cross-browser compatible) version of the XMLHttpRequest
[09:40:20] <Krinkle> you'll want to use that instead of XMLHttpRequest
[09:40:25] <damjan> Krinkle: ok, but it doesn't have responseText and also readState is 1 all the time
[09:40:43] <damjan> I need access to those two (and I don't care about IE)
[09:40:50] <JackBauer24> callumacrae: you can make a global config variable and then use it in fadeIn()
[09:41:09] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: its not a great idea but http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/wYgvM/
[09:41:10] <XCoder> thx eddiemonge . Is there a jquery function to do that for all browsers?
[09:41:15] <callumacrae> That there is the definition of a constant, JackBauer24 ;-)
[09:41:26] <callumacrae> eddiemonge: Thanks :-)
[09:41:27] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: why would that not be allowed?
[09:41:31] <eddiemonge> XCoder: no
[09:41:33] <callumacrae> I don't know
[09:41:39] <eddiemonge> you have to make your own
[09:41:42] <XCoder> damn it :D
[09:41:47] <JackBauer24> callumacrea: I didn't notica that, but that sounds radicalous
[09:41:57] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: that sounds like a dumb rule. thats actually stated?
[09:42:14] <callumacrae> "All of these fade calls should be DRYed. There should be one function which fades in, and one which fades out, which are called from the rest of the code"
[09:42:24] <callumacrae> I don't get it either
[09:42:34] <eddiemonge> damjan: for what purpose?
[09:42:54] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: ok so adding the speed doesnt go against that
[09:42:55] <damjan> eddiemonge: I want to do a watchdog on longpoll connections
[09:43:18] <eddiemonge> damjan: and you dont want comet?
[09:43:28] <callumacrae> eddiemonge: That's specifically what he was referring to, because that is what I have been doing
[09:43:28] <damjan> eddiemonge: the server sends a heartbeat every 10s, I want to see if responseText is growing, so that I know the connection is alive
[09:43:44] <damjan> eddiemonge: the server is CouchDB, so I can't change that
[09:43:57] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: who is he? and he is probably an idiot
[09:44:15] <eddiemonge> damjan: thats a database, not a server
[09:44:16] <callumacrae> He is a non-javascript developer
[09:44:18] <callumacrae> :D
[09:44:30] <callumacrae> I don't know what he wants, but this will do
[09:44:32] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: then hit him over the head and tell him the correct way to do it
[09:44:42] <damjan> eddiemonge: CouchDB is a database AND a http + json server
[09:44:58] <eddiemonge> callumacrae: im just saying that doing it that way is a really bad idea as that approach could be crushed or changed in a jq update
[09:45:32] <eddiemonge> damjan: how are you thinking a longpoll connection will work?
[09:45:46] <damjan> eddiemonge: ? sorry?
[09:46:03] <damjan> eddiemonge: CouchDB has builtin longpoll support on _changes feed
[09:46:13] <damjan> it notifes you of changes in the documents it stores
[09:47:01] <gnarf> damjan: you may have to write your own ajax transport
[09:47:46] <damjan> gnarf: hmm, ok, I'll look at it
[09:49:40] <gnarf> damjan: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Transports
[09:49:53] <damjan> thanks
[09:52:30] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: ok so opera mobile is now my default browser. so what?
[09:52:36] <miketaylr> haha
[09:52:44] <miketaylr> ME TOO
[09:53:16] <eddiemonge> the share feature is great
[09:53:50] <miketaylr> yeah, i also like saving pages for reading when i'm on the train
[09:54:38] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: but im still not agreeing on desktop opera
[09:54:45] <miketaylr> heh
[09:54:49] <miketaylr> but...but..but.. :P
[09:55:22] <ravenzz> is it opera mini good as well?
[09:55:34] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: do you have a dumb phone?
[09:56:14] <miketaylr> opera mini is good, even on iOS or Android
[09:56:25] <ravenzz> uhm almost dumb
[09:56:29] <ravenzz> it is an htc wildfire
[09:56:45] <miketaylr> it's fast
[09:57:01] <ravenzz> miketaylr which features are not included in the mini version?
[09:57:18] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: what is the point of the navigation toolbar in desktop?
[09:57:21] <miketaylr> ravenzz: mini is a proxy browser, so ajaxy-type sites aren't going to be the same
[09:57:33] <michael_mbp> guys
[09:57:37] <miketaylr> eddiemonge: which toolbar is that?
[09:57:38] <ravenzz> oh I see
[09:57:42] <michael_mbp> I'm making a JSON request to one of my own apps
[09:57:45] <michael_mbp> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:3002/videos.json. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:57:48] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: Navigation
[09:57:54] <miketaylr> ravenzz: but pages are about 80% compressed, so way faster
[09:58:07] <michael_mbp> looks like CSRF?
[09:58:31] <ravenzz> is it even better than the default android browser?
[09:58:32] <eddiemonge> michael_mbp: is it going to the same port and all? does it have to be an absolute url?
[09:58:36] <miketaylr> eddiemonge: oh, i dunno, i've never used it
[09:58:44] <miketaylr> might be for keyboard users
[09:58:46] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: mobile is yeah. default android sucks
[09:59:00] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: everything in it is greyed out for the sites i tested
[09:59:01] <michael_mbp> as of right now yeah, I'm running the app under development locally
[09:59:21] <miketaylr> weird, if i find out i'll let you know eddiemonge
[09:59:23] <michael_mbp> when I move to production it'll be a subdomain.domain.org/videos.json
[09:59:33] <eddiemonge> michael_mbp: i mean the links, are they pointing to the same port and everything?
[09:59:37] <michael_mbp> but both applications will share domain.org
[09:59:56] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: ill keep trying opera every now and then but at the moment Chrome is my goto
[09:59:57] <michael_mbp> what links?
[10:00:05] <miketaylr> yeah, chrome is good
[10:00:36] <eddiemonge> i mostly like it for its minimal chrome
[10:00:49] <ravenzz> same for me
[10:00:51] <miketaylr> yeah, you have to do a bit of work to remove stuff in opera
[10:01:03] <miketaylr> but pretty much everything you can right-click and remove
[10:01:11] <ravenzz> it sucks with there are flash stuffs running
[10:01:14] <miketaylr> customize > remove, or wahtever
[10:01:36] <ravenzz> eddiemonge have you experienced issues with flash on chrome?
[10:01:46] <miketaylr> but chrome's got a nice default, simple feel
[10:02:00] <Aquaguy> Hey
[10:02:18] <michael_mbp> all
[10:02:19] <Aquaguy> is there any way to stop a .each(function () {}) with a break or something?
[10:02:31] <michael_mbp> it's a security feature for AJAX and local files
[10:02:31] <michael_mbp> right.
[10:02:33] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: i try to avoid flash at all costs
[10:03:05] <eddiemonge> ? each @ Aquaguy
[10:03:06] <bot-t> Aquaguy, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:03:22] <Aquaguy> yeah, and? nothing there
[10:03:32] <tonyjcamp> @Aquaguy  you can use return
[10:03:45] <tonyjcamp> If a condition is met, just return;
[10:03:54] <miketaylr> opera:config#UserPrefs|EnableOnDemandPlugin in Opera is neat--you have to click on a flash movie for it to load
[10:03:57] <arashtamere> nah you can't use return it'll just call the same function on the next element
[10:04:10] <Aquaguy> oh ok
[10:04:10] <eddiemonge> Aquaguy: really? because it is there how to stop the loop
[10:04:11] <Aquaguy> thanks
[10:04:26] <arashtamere> ah you have to return false
[10:04:54] <miketaylr> time to bounce, PEACE
[10:05:57] <eddiemonge> right before examples it says "We can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning false."
[10:10:40] <ravenzz> woah!
[10:10:46] <ravenzz> it is fast!
[10:19:01] <Astus> Would a color-changing background based on mouse movement be ressource intensive on the user´s PC?
[10:22:14] <eddiemonge> Astus: probably
[10:22:44] <Astus> eddiemonge, thanks.
[10:26:49] <gnarf> Astus: not that intensive if you throttle the mousemove event
[11:13:46] <eric_lewis> yo errbody
[11:14:00] <eric_lewis> anybody know of a good side scroller collision detection library for jquery/js?
[11:16:35] <falieson> I tried changing     $(document).ready(function() { $('input[type="text"]).addClass("idleField"); .... to $(document).ready(function() {       $('input[type="text"]'||'textarea').addClass("idleField"); ... but that didn't work. what am i supposed to do?
[11:17:07] <drd> falieson: $('input[type=text], textarea')
[11:17:12] <falieson> thanks, haha
[11:17:15] <drd> just like in css ;)
[11:17:23] <falieson> <-- still learning both
[11:17:28] <drd> 'foo' || 'bar' is true in javascript
[11:17:56] <drd> er, actually it's 'foo'
[11:18:00] <falieson> right
[11:18:02] <drd> stupid truthiness
[11:18:25] <falieson> so the comma, just adds objects?
[11:19:14] <drd> yeah, if you want to change all headings in css its:
[11:19:31] <drd> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { display: inline; }
[11:19:38] <falieson> that's pretty sweet
[11:21:27] <falieson> thanks drd
[11:21:33] <drd> np
[11:25:11] <falieson> the focusField doesn't seem to work though :-/
[11:25:36] <falieson> ah... nm I see it =)
[11:26:27] <juha_> holy cat poop, batman!
[11:40:59] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/WEVH9/ is there any reason why my borders should be yellow + the color specified with focusField ?
[11:45:54] <falieson> drd , can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/WEVH9/ is there any reason why my borders should be yellow + the color specified with focusField ?
[11:45:58] <falieson> i think its something simple...

[11:58:57] <yayqueryyy> hi snov  ;)
[11:59:02] <snover> hi guyssss
[11:59:15] <snover> youâ€™re reunioning way too early in the day
[11:59:42] <snover> go watch bats and come back when the basement-dwellers wake up
[12:07:41] <gnarf> anyone know of a good blog talking about how to solve this http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42 ?
[12:09:00] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/WEVH9/ is there any reason why my borders should be yellow + the color specified with focusField ? I think its something easy
[12:10:21] <yayqueryyy> set outline to 0
[12:12:10] <falieson> yayqueryyy: now its just yellow.. rather than #333
[12:24:59] <botfather> wauw
[12:25:01] <botfather> huge
[12:27:42] <JKarsrud> falieson: works correctly here...
[12:28:52] <bsod2> yes, botfather :)
[12:29:11] <JKarsrud> gnarf: haven't seen any blogposts about it, no
[12:29:30] <botfather> oi bsod2 ;]
[12:29:34] <gnarf> JKarsrud: http://stackoverflow.com/q/7779825/91914 -- I think someone needs to write one - this question comes up A LOT
[12:30:54] <JKarsrud> gnarf: for sure! Maybe addy could do it, he seems to be writing a lot of good articles/blog posts lately ;)
[12:31:56] <falieson> JKarsrud: when you click on a field you don't get a yellow border around the border?
[12:32:36] <JKarsrud> falieson: nope, not with outline:0; on .focusField
[12:33:27] <falieson> JKarsrud: where does the yellow come from?
[12:33:31] <JKarsrud> btw: why aren't you using the :focus pseudo selector for focused elements?
[12:33:50] <falieson> JKarsrud: I just copied this focus thing from a tutorial online
[12:33:51] <JKarsrud> falieson: what browser are you on?
[12:33:54] <falieson> chrome
[12:34:00] <JKarsrud> Ok, on windows, then?
[12:34:30] <falieson> hmm.. nm.. i readded it and its gone, maybe the file wasnt refreshed on the server when I tried it
[12:34:31] <JKarsrud> because chrome has an orange outline on focused elements on windows. It's blue on OSX
[12:34:34] <falieson> border:0 did it
[12:34:49] <falieson> hmm.. how do you override it? or does border:0 do that?
[12:34:54] <JKarsrud> http://jsfiddle.net/WEVH9/1/
[12:34:59] <JKarsrud> outline:0; works around it :)
[12:35:04] <falieson> thanks :-)
[12:35:20] <JKarsrud> But I'll write you up a better solution that doesn't rely on JS :)
[12:35:32] <falieson> do you know jquery.validate() ? I want it to just change the background color rather than add text
[12:35:48] <falieson> *background color of the form element
[12:37:52] <JKarsrud> falieson: better code; http://jsfiddle.net/WEVH9/2/
[12:38:15] <JKarsrud> falieson: no, haven't used .validate() in ages
[12:39:31] <JKarsrud> hey sean`
[12:39:48] <falieson> JKarsrud: ooo... thats so much nicer
[12:39:50] <falieson> JKarsrud: lol
[12:40:40] <JKarsrud> falieson: what's lol? :)
[12:40:49] <falieson> JKarsrud: your css version the js version
[12:40:55] <JKarsrud> aha
[12:41:02] <JKarsrud> yeah
[12:41:03] <falieson> *vs the
[12:41:51] <JKarsrud> I also added a small placeholder attribute there instead. If you want to support browsers that doesn't have placeholder (which is a new HTML5 attribute), google jquery.placeholder
[12:45:51] <falieson> with jquery validation, instead of a message I want it to change the form style tochanging the background and border, anyone have an idea how to do this? I'd probably prefer a method other than changing jquery.validate
[12:46:28] <deed02392> Hi, how do I determine the size of an array (number of elements) when dealing within the jquery template? e.g. {{if artists.count() > 1}}<h1>more than one</h1>{{/if}}
[12:53:13] <Kamakazi> is there a way with jquery-ui to pass in the content of the dialog instead of having to have a div existing to tie to it?

[13:08:38] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/ZaYsn/ when you enter text into a field that has the class errorField afterwards all the text is removed...
[13:11:00] <gnarf> JuJuBee: you'll have better luck binding to the forms submit event
[13:11:50] <gnarf> like var shouldCancelSubmit = false; $("#Form").submit( function( event ) { if ( shouldCancelSubmit ) { event.preventDefault(); } });
[13:12:04] <gnarf> then set it to true before the confirm, and false after confirm
[13:12:15] <gnarf> and then trigger submit again
[13:12:22] <gnarf> rather than stopping the click on the button

[13:18:33] <tsyrak> and if i need words before or after that
[13:19:01] <tsyrak> i'll just work something around an index for those spans
[13:20:12] <JuJuBee> gnarf: thanks, but I don't understand what you are suggesting.
[13:20:17] <Camer0n> http://vermilionsite.com/phone/?id=1
[13:20:27] <Camer0n> if you go there and mouse over the image it zooms in
[13:20:35] <Camer0n> when you move the mouse off and on again it stops working
[13:20:36] <Camer0n> why!?
[13:20:43] <gnarf> JuJuBee: use the form submit event instead of the button click event
[13:21:01] <gnarf> JuJuBee: then preventDefault if it hasn't been confirmed yet, otherwise confirm
[13:21:56] <gnarf> replace that "otherwise" with "and"
[13:22:16] <gnarf> so like you prevent the submit and pop the confirm, or they have already confirmed and you do nothing
[13:22:39] <Camer0n> ravenzz!
[13:22:43] <Camer0n> http://vermilionsite.com/phone/?id=1
[13:22:46] <Camer0n> if you go there and mouse over the image it zooms in
[13:22:50] <Camer0n> when you move the mouse off and on again it stops working
[13:23:06] <Camer0n>  
[13:23:16] <gnarf> wow- you just like pounced on ravenzz
[13:23:30] <Camer0n> yes
[13:23:33] <Camer0n> :D
[13:23:56] <Camer0n> he's the only one whos ever actually helped me one here lol
[13:23:57] <Coderah> Camer0n: look in the console, there is an error
[13:23:57] <Dreamstar> Is there a great way to push with jQuery?
[13:23:58] <ravenzz> omg I need to smoke, I should uncheck, reconnect on disconnect/keep channels opne
[13:23:59] <ravenzz> lol
[13:24:12] <JuJuBee> gnarf: like http://pastebin.com/0UPnTKtV ?
[13:24:16] <Camer0n> oh
[13:24:26] <Camer0n> so how would i fix that?
[13:24:46] <gnarf> JuJuBee: yeah, except you prolly want shouldSubmit=false
[13:24:59] <gnarf> and then after line 6
[13:25:02] <gnarf> trigger the submit again
[13:25:08] <gnarf> $("#testForm").submit();
[13:25:25] <gnarf> actually
[13:25:36] <gnarf> that jConfirm should be in the if as well
[13:26:51] <Camer0n> it says its in the jquery file Coderah
[13:26:57] <Camer0n> jquery.min.js
[13:27:17] <JuJuBee> Wont this result in a loop?
[13:27:19] <Coderah> Camer0n: yeah one sec im looking.. just cause it says the error is there doesn't really mean it is
[13:27:25] <Camer0n> ok
[13:27:51] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/nVPfc/ validation works, but the correct class isn't being applied and I would like .errorField to override the focus until there is no longer an error... can anyone help?
[13:31:19] <Coderah> Camer0n: the loupe plugin is causing the error (as far as i can tell) it's trying to animate with easeOutBack which is not defined or something to that effect. I have not used this plugin so I'm not entirely sure how to help you
[13:31:34] <Camer0n> hmm
[13:31:36] <JuJuBee> gnarf: if I trigger the submit again, won't that just create a loop?
[13:31:47] <gnarf> JuJuBee: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/TmHF2/
[13:32:09] <gnarf> JuJuBee: not if the jConfirm doesn't run because you know they already confirmed it
[13:32:34] <gnarf> and i didn't feel like setting up jConfirm
[13:32:38] <gnarf> so i used ui dialog
[13:33:14] <JuJuBee> gnarf: thanks, I will try to make that work using jConfirm...
[13:36:33] <gnarf> JuJuBee: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/TmHF2/1/
[13:37:32] <gnarf> JuJuBee: was just trying to write a wrapper so I could use the same function as you
[13:37:33] <gnarf> :)
[13:37:56] <gnarf> although darnit
[13:38:00] <gnarf> mine needs a title
[13:38:43] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/TmHF2/2/ there JuJuBee
[13:42:08] <gnarf> now minus the bug in my fake jConfirm: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/TmHF2/3/
[13:42:33] <gnarf> JuJuBee: ^^^
[13:43:59] <JuJuBee> gnarf: Hmmmm, still doesn't work when I use jConfirm
[13:44:18] <gnarf> JuJuBee: is it working in my fiddle?
[13:44:44] <gnarf> if so, i leave debugging your problem up to you.... try adding some console.log()'s into the code to see whats being executed, etc
[13:45:59] <ryanneufeld> anyone know a lot about jquery ui's sortable and draggable widgets?
[13:47:32] <ryanneufeld> ?seen ajpiano
[13:47:50] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, #7533 (Problem with id containing a period) – jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7533
[13:48:45] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: what do you want to know?
[13:48:52] <gnarf> ?ask @ryanneufeld
[13:49:03] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:49:04] <ryanneufeld> wow, it's been a while since I've been here lol
[13:49:12] <ryanneufeld> I forgot about that rule lol
[13:49:21] <ryanneufeld> I have two ul's
[13:49:33] <ryanneufeld> I need to be able drag and drop from on to the other
[13:49:37] <ryanneufeld> one way
[13:49:42] <ryanneufeld> the destination list
[13:49:46] <ryanneufeld> also needs to be sortable
[13:49:48] <gnarf> that totally sortable()
[13:49:52] <gnarf> on both sides
[13:50:07] <gnarf> there are some archaic options you need to play with
[13:50:10] <gnarf> like connectWith
[13:50:18] <ryanneufeld> I don't want the starting side sortable though
[13:50:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:50:18] <ryanneufeld> I'm playing with that right now
[13:50:24] <gnarf> so
[13:50:27] <gnarf> what you want
[13:50:34] <ryanneufeld> I don't want the source list to be sortable
[13:50:35] <gnarf> is .draggable's on the "source"
[13:50:44] <gnarf> that when you drop on the sortable get sorted?
[13:50:44] <ryanneufeld> I'm getting there
[13:50:51] <ryanneufeld> I did that first
[13:51:06] <ryanneufeld> but I found that the drop method was being called on the droppable before the sort stop
[13:51:06] <gnarf> interesting
[13:51:19] <ryanneufeld> the problem is that I have some ajax on the droppable
[13:51:28] <ryanneufeld> so settings are instant
[13:51:35] <gnarf> right
[13:51:44] <ryanneufeld> no save button
[13:51:44] <ryanneufeld> and the UX does a red BG when it fails
[13:52:00] <ryanneufeld> so what's happening is that it's 'failing' every time you sort the list
[13:52:26] <gnarf> sounds like a separate issue atm...
[13:52:42] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/nVPfc/ validation works, but the correct class isn't being applied and I would like .errorField to override the focus until there is no longer an error... can anyone help?
[13:53:33] <JuJuBee> gnarf: so some weird behavior.  my form has an ID of testForm, but if I use form=$(#testForm)  it does not work.  If I use $(#form) it works...
[13:53:48] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: if you like I could show you what's going on
[13:54:12] <ryanneufeld> I don't have a fiddle, but i could get the code to a public place for a demo
[13:55:28] <StevePC> I have a stupid JS question. I write a bunch of functions in a html page and everything works. If I put them in a .js file and then try to call them then nothing works. What am I doing wrong?
[13:55:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: It sounds like you're asking to drag a clone from one list into a sortable on the other....
[13:55:46] <gnarf> the ajax should probably happen on the sortstop
[13:56:02] <gnarf> but you need to find some way for the 'incoming item' to also trigger "sorting" behavior right?
[13:56:10] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: my original was just to have a list as a draggable, and one as a droppable
[13:56:20] <ryanneufeld> but I wanted the droppable to be sortable as well
[13:56:32] <ryanneufeld> yes, that's kinda what i'm after
[13:56:50] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't have to be sortable as you drop it, just so long as once it's been dropped it can be
[13:56:57] <gnarf> ahh
[13:57:02] <gnarf> okay
[13:57:18] <gnarf> so you need to detect in the dragstop if its a "new item" or a sortable right?
[13:58:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:58:27] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/1290131
[13:58:27] <gnarf> could you attach some flag on the <LI> that is set onces its added to the "sortable" side ?
[13:58:32] <ryanneufeld> that's the code I have right now
[13:58:39] <gnarf> like .data( "destList", true )
[13:58:52] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm having a race condition though
[13:59:02] <gnarf> dragstop happens before sortstop
[13:59:14] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:59:18] <ryanneufeld> lemme test that
[13:59:39] <gnarf> $("#destList li").data("destList", true);
[14:00:03] <gnarf> then set the "destList" in the dragstop that wont be firing a sortstop
[14:00:20] <ryanneufeld> I see
[14:00:21] <gnarf> because it didn't start in the "destList"
[14:00:36] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: might work? *shrug*
[14:00:39] <ryanneufeld> I was also thinking about changing the droppable's accept
[14:00:47] <ryanneufeld> to only accept li's from the destination list
[14:00:55] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: that might mess up the sortable
[14:00:59] <gnarf> but try it
[14:01:12] <ryanneufeld> I will
[14:01:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: could you make the drop zone a containing div?
[14:01:34] <gnarf> instead of the ul?
[14:02:02] <ryanneufeld> I could, but I don't want to sacrifice the UI
[14:02:06] <ryanneufeld> *UX
[14:02:14] <ryanneufeld> it's an image gallery manager
[14:02:30] <ryanneufeld> and I'd like it to be as natural as possible
[14:02:45] <bcardarella> If I have a common teardown function I'm calling in every qunit module is there a way to extract this so I only have to define it once but it is still called for every module?
[14:02:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: when you drag into a sortable, does it let you insert in place?
[14:02:56] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:03:10] <ryanneufeld> not unless you're using two sortables linked
[14:03:28] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: then creating a wrapping div probably wont sacrifice anything
[14:03:37] <gnarf> unless your CSS is REALLY picky about using > selectors
[14:03:54] <ryanneufeld> no, it doesn't have any of those
[14:04:03] <gnarf> create a wrapping div, put the droppable code on it
[14:04:12] <gnarf> sortable stays where it was
[14:04:19] <peter___> hey.... is there a jquery function to check if a scrollbar exists?
[14:04:33] <gnarf> that way the "drop zone" contains the whole UL
[14:04:36] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: wouldn't I then have to find the right place to append the li
[14:04:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: you don't do that now anyway right?
[14:05:12] <gnarf> "finding the right place" that is
[14:05:26] <gnarf> the current droppable implementation probably only appends right?
[14:05:43] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah, I specifically append it
[14:05:47] <ryanneufeld> did you see my gist?
[14:06:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm not actually appending the LI it self
[14:06:42] <gnarf> right
[14:06:45] <gnarf> so like
[14:06:47] <ryanneufeld> I clone it from the source list, then once dropped I pull some data from it, do a getJSON
[14:06:53] <ryanneufeld> then use a template to add one
[14:06:56] <gnarf> $gallery.wrap("<div>")
[14:07:01] <gnarf> and use that as the droppable
[14:07:17] <ryanneufeld> I don't even need to do that... the whole UL is in a div already
[14:07:20] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[14:07:24] <ryanneufeld> you might be on to something
[14:07:28] <ryanneufeld> lemme try that
[14:08:26] <ryanneufeld> hm
[14:08:30] <ryanneufeld> that's not it either
[14:08:30] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: filename.split( "/" ).pop()
[14:08:42] <ryanneufeld> nice
[14:08:47] <ryanneufeld> why didn't I think of that@
[14:08:48] <ryanneufeld> !
[14:08:54] <gnarf> ?js "abc/123/omg".split("/").pop()
[14:08:56] <bot-t> gnarf: "omg"
[14:09:35] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: nice, thanks
[14:09:49] <ryanneufeld> using the parent div as the dropable doesn't seem to work either...
[14:10:01] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: are you getting extra drop events?
[14:10:07] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:10:09] <gnarf> that are maybe bubbled up from sortable ul?
[14:10:24] <ryanneufeld> event.stopPropagation()?
[14:10:29] <gnarf> check console.log( this ) in your drop
[14:10:32] <astropirate> Can someone please explain why the `style` property of an element is not taken into account when i insert the element via .html()?  example: http://jsfiddle.net/MFfFx/7/
[14:10:49] <gnarf> or even look at event.target ?
[14:11:01] <gnarf> make sure its the outer div not the inner sort?
[14:11:13] <ryanneufeld> checking now
[14:11:29] <ryanneufeld> on the sort
[14:11:35] <ryanneufeld> this is the parent div
[14:11:37] <ryanneufeld> ef
[14:11:44] <gnarf> that makes sense
[14:11:46] <gnarf> its bound there
[14:11:52] <gnarf> but what about event.target
[14:11:57] <gnarf> or even attrs on the ui
[14:12:00] <dreamss> astropirate, im a newb and most likely wrong.. by try and use .css() on that div
[14:12:09] <gnarf> is there any diff?
[14:12:18] <ryanneufeld> target is also the div
[14:12:23] <astropirate> dreamss, .css() works, but in this cas i have to use .html()
[14:12:31] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: what about the item
[14:12:44] <ryanneufeld> sorry?
[14:13:11] <ryanneufeld> on the sort, the target is the ul
[14:13:12] <ryanneufeld> as expected
[14:13:20] <gnarf> cool
[14:13:33] <gnarf> you could say if ( event.target !== this ) return;
[14:13:50] <ryanneufeld> on the dropable?
[14:13:53] <gnarf> yeah
[14:13:59] <ryanneufeld> but it is
[14:14:01] <ryanneufeld> on the sort
[14:14:06] <gnarf> jsut skip all that extra droppable
[14:14:15] <ryanneufeld> this and the target is the same on that event
[14:14:18] <gnarf> oh
[14:14:20] <gnarf> okay then
[14:14:24] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:14:26] <gnarf> ui hash?
[14:14:28] <gnarf> ui.item ?
[14:14:36] <gnarf> is there a class on the draggable thing
[14:14:41] <gnarf> that isn't on the sortable thing?
[14:14:43] <dreamss> astropirate cant u just call .css on that class or add id to the div and set the props?
[14:14:46] <dreamss> style
[14:14:48] <gnarf> ui.item.is(".inTheListAlready")
[14:15:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm thinking of that too...
[14:15:37] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: presumably, the sort stop function will eventually be updating the "order"
[14:15:42] <astropirate> dreamss, I can, but i dont want to because i'm creating > 2000 elements and i dont' want to create dom elements for them my self, I want to let the browser do it for me
[14:15:53] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yes, it will do an ajax of it's own
[14:16:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: but you need to stop it from thinking every drop is a new image
[14:16:06] <ryanneufeld> bingo
[14:16:14] <dreamss> fun :/
[14:16:16] <dreamss> well
[14:16:26] <gnarf> .addClass("draggable-thumbs") on 23 of your gist
[14:16:29] <astropirate> dreamss, its much much faster, aside from the stupid style property being ignored
[14:16:34] <gnarf> and check for it in the drop
[14:16:35] <astropirate> for some odd reason
[14:16:47] <dreamss> u can just set the class once and any div will read it?
[14:17:18] <dreamss> and yeah inlines... i had issues with those
[14:17:21] <astropirate> dreamss, not in this case, i'm trying to set the  top: and left: properties
[14:17:27] <dreamss> meh
[14:18:42] <ryanneufeld> gnarf:  we both just had the same thought
[14:18:52] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: by adding that class
[14:19:06] <ryanneufeld> and updating the accepts option to li.whateverclassIchoose
[14:19:13] <ryanneufeld> the drop doesn't happen on sort
[14:19:18] <ryanneufeld> beauty
[14:19:49] <ryanneufeld> peter___: there are native methods for checking window height, and you can get the height of the body element
[14:19:57] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nice

[14:21:11] <gnarf> yeah
[14:21:13] <gnarf> something did
[14:21:17] <gnarf> but its not huge
[14:21:25] <gnarf> you should make the getJSON call a function
[14:21:35] <ryanneufeld> yes, I should
[14:21:43] <gnarf> but you'll refactor there eventually
[14:21:44] <ryanneufeld> I plan on breaking it all out eventually
[14:21:49] <gnarf> that drop function is pretty huge :)
[14:21:52] <ryanneufeld> yeah, obvious huh?

[14:25:11] <crash21> hello, I want to call load and then the loaded html have load too. the first time it runs ok but the loaded html looks like dont have load binded... any help please?
[14:25:44] <ryanneufeld> crash21: so you want load html, that has JS in it that calls load?
[14:25:52] <ryanneufeld> why not just have it all load at once?
[14:26:47] <crash21> ryanneufeld: exactly, want site use only ajax, so every link on every page will call load
[14:27:09] <ryanneufeld> crash21: so SEO isn't an issue for you then?
[14:27:21] <crash21> not at all
[14:27:26] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[14:27:35] <crash21> its for training issues
[14:27:52] <gnarf> crash21: don't be lazy, write the same javascript for every page
[14:27:58] <crash21> jsut want link -> load form -> submit form all in ajax
[14:28:11] <ryanneufeld> oh
[14:28:16] <ryanneufeld> you don't want load then
[14:28:18] <crash21> @gnarf i have master page
[14:28:21] <gnarf> you want callback
[14:28:23] <ryanneufeld> just put all your HTML on the page
[14:28:34] <ryanneufeld> and use callbacks to show/hide the appropriate parts of the page
[14:28:34] <crash21> i use this
[14:28:37] <gnarf> callback calls your 'initialize' stuff
[14:28:41] <gnarf> ?newContent
[14:28:42] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[14:29:08] <crash21> see here what i do http://pastebin.com/Av4THq0S
[14:29:38] <gnarf> omg
[14:29:46] <gnarf> that is SO broken
[14:30:21] <crash21> why?
[14:30:22] <gnarf> you a) are loading an entire html document into a div
[14:30:59] <crash21> i use symfony, for some reason it returns only the nested page without the master page
[14:31:09] <gnarf> b) you'll be injecting new copies of jQuery, everything else (assuming you have some sort of template)
[14:31:21] <crash21> so it returns only what i need exactly without <html> <head> etc
[14:31:36] <gnarf> c) if you just made a "pageLoad" function and call it from the callback in .load and your standard document ready you've already solved your problem
[14:32:08] <ryanneufeld> gnarf++
[14:32:11] <gnarf> don't inline <script> s
[14:32:14] <gnarf> ever
[14:32:31] <crash21> i dont inline i have thi code on ajax.js
[14:32:33] <gnarf> crash21: jquerymobile has a navigation framework like this already
[14:32:44] <ryanneufeld> I was just gonna suggest that actually
[14:32:50] <ryanneufeld> by retheming it
[14:32:55] <crash21> i think the problem is that ajax on symfony don;t load all html
[14:32:57] <ryanneufeld> you could have what you're after
[14:33:01] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:33:06] <ryanneufeld> that's not it
[14:33:08] <gnarf> thats a GOOD thing
[14:33:12] <ryanneufeld> symfony is giving you what you need
[14:33:12] <gnarf> thank it
[14:33:20] <ryanneufeld> You're doing it wrong
[14:33:26] <crash21> so how do it?
[14:33:34] <gnarf> c) if you just made a "pageLoad" function and call it from the callback in .load and your standard document ready you've already solved your problem
[14:33:46] <gnarf> you make a function that you call after you load new content
[14:33:53] <gnarf> that you also call after you load the main document
[14:33:59] <gnarf> ?boom
[14:34:00] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[14:34:27] <crash21> is it possible a sample? i don't understand what you mean exactly
[14:34:33] <gnarf> you just have to put the code for every page on your site in one javascript, which is what you need
[14:34:59] <ryanneufeld> crash21: gnarf like this https://gist.github.com/1290177
[14:35:17] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[14:35:17] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[14:35:30] <gnarf> eh - live is a pain
[14:35:30] <ryanneufeld> ?shazam
[14:35:34] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, #2997 ($.clone() bugs in IE when $.length>1 and elements don't ... - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2997
[14:35:36] <gnarf> also
[14:35:42] <crash21> i am gonna test
[14:35:44] <gnarf> that doesn't check for XHR / Cross page stuff
[14:35:54] <gnarf> ?sop
[14:35:55] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[14:35:56] <gnarf> and what not
[14:36:03] <crash21> this will be inside document load right?
[14:36:06] <ryanneufeld> well, it was a basic example
[14:36:07] <gnarf> but like this is why this whole approach is flawed
[14:36:08] <ryanneufeld> NO
[14:36:09] <crash21> document read*
[14:36:12] <ryanneufeld> yea
[14:36:34] <ryanneufeld> crash21: why is it that you want it all ajax?
[14:36:37] <gnarf> crash21: basically, if you want my advice - don't do it
[14:36:55] <gnarf> crash21: if you really want something like this, look at using jquerymobile
[14:37:04] <ryanneufeld> jquerymobile+++++
[14:37:14] <ryanneufeld> Lobe that shiz
[14:37:29] <gnarf> its going to handle all sorts of other issues with this idea that you haven't even realized you will have yet
[14:37:36] <gnarf> like browser back buttons
[14:37:39] <ryanneufeld> built this with it in 1.5 weeks: http://m.metrolyrics.com/
[14:37:56] <crash21> its for training only
[14:38:03] <crash21> not for development or something
[14:38:11] <ryanneufeld> training of whom?
[14:38:21] <ryanneufeld> you trainging yourself to do this stuff?
[14:38:21] <crash21> of me :D
[14:38:25] <crash21> yeah
[14:38:27] <ryanneufeld> or is it a training app?
[14:38:28] <ryanneufeld> ah
[14:38:46] <ryanneufeld> then learn this: you're setting yourself up for a world of headaches by going down this path
[14:39:14] <gnarf> crash21: best advice - use a library that handles it
[14:39:20] <ryanneufeld> ajaxing an entire site is not simple. Why do you think there aren't many that are done that way?
[14:39:41] <gnarf> what ryanneufeld said
[14:39:55] <crash21> with the code you sent me it loads page without ajax even if i added event.preventDefault();
[14:40:12] <crash21> dont use ajax
[14:41:07] <ragas> http://pastie.org/2702556 is some (attempted) key controls for a slideshow.  the function works fine, binded to a click link.  Whats wrong?
[14:41:24] <ryanneufeld> cleaner version :https://gist.github.com/1290177 crash21
[14:41:28] <crash21> http://pastebin.com/gG0J12qP
[14:41:56] <crash21> no need return false, just event.preventDefault();
[14:41:59] <ryanneufeld> crash21: are you getting any console errors?
[14:42:04] <gnarf> crash21: https://gist.github.com/980b6d8879ace869d63c
[14:42:12] <ryanneufeld> return false; does the same thing
[14:42:28] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: return false is bad practice nowadays imo
[14:42:29] <crash21> ok
[14:42:30] <ryanneufeld> and it's smaller code, and doesn't require you to add a parameter to the callback function
[14:42:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: but i write code at library level now
[14:42:53] <gnarf> "preventDefault" is usually all you mean
[14:43:00] <gnarf> you don't want to also "stopPropagation"
[14:43:03] <gnarf> which return false does
[14:43:08] <ryanneufeld> no, I usually
[14:43:09] <ryanneufeld> do
[14:43:13] <ryanneufeld> that's why i use false
[14:43:20] <ryanneufeld> I know the difference :P
[14:43:55] <ryanneufeld> any how, whichever one you use
[14:43:56] <crash21> yeah it works! excellent!
[14:44:12] <gnarf> crash21: notice that setupPageEvent function is being called as a callback to load ?
[14:44:18] <gnarf> and as a document ready function?
[14:44:22] <gnarf> thats what i was talking about
[14:44:39] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you're rebinding on load?
[14:45:02] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: for something as simple as events, we have delegate and live, sure
[14:45:12] <gnarf> but there are times where you need to .each() some of your content for some reason
[14:45:16] <gnarf> and you can't do that with live()
[14:45:22] <gnarf> hence this method
[14:45:33] <gnarf> and also see ?newContent
[14:45:34] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[14:46:07] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:46:11] <ryanneufeld> well, thanks again
[14:46:12] <ryanneufeld> i'm out
[14:46:18] <ryanneufeld> good luck crash21, thanks gnarf
[14:46:25] <crash21> thanks a lot
[14:48:39] <falieson> can someone take a look at this js? http://jsfiddle.net/zcyyu/ I think its just missing a ) or } or ; somewhere but I can't figure out where. you can use recursive success: right?
[14:48:53] <JuJuBee> gnarf: I appreciate your help, but I cannot get this to work for the life of me.
[14:49:20] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[14:49:21] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[14:49:36] <gnarf> in other words: whats the issue?
[14:50:35] <gnarf> falieson: that is not recursive btw
[14:50:39] <gnarf> also try jshint.com
[14:50:43] <JuJuBee> When I click the submit button, it seems to be "post"ing  but I don't get the page I expect.  http://pastebin.com/KQh6FsSQ
[14:51:50] <falieson> gnarf: thanks for jshint
[14:52:07] <gnarf> JuJuBee: what are you getting then?
[14:53:01] <JuJuBee> Nothing more than the original form
[14:53:44] <gnarf> JuJuBee: you need a value on the submitButton
[14:53:45] <gnarf> input
[14:53:51] <gnarf> JuJuBee: its not being set because there is no value
[14:53:52] <gnarf> :)
[14:54:15] <JuJuBee> no diff
[14:55:10] <falieson> gnarf: updated: http://jsfiddle.net/aeMd8/  . I'm getting a number of errors, missing ; and expected ) but I'm not sure where they are really supposed to go
[14:55:22] <falieson> I'm kinda just piecing together jS  without really knowiong jS very well
[14:55:43] <gnarf> falieson: comma after the errorPlacement function prolly?
[14:56:17] <gnarf> Line 7: success: function() {
[14:56:17] <gnarf> Expected '}' to match '{' from line 2 and instead saw 'success'.
[14:56:42] <falieson> that helped
[14:57:54] <gnarf> falieson: its harder for me to parse your intention than JavaScript i think
[14:58:03] <gnarf> falieson: cuz like lines 10-17 make no sense
[14:58:26] <gnarf> you're missing a $.ajax it seems
[14:59:09] <falieson> oh, see I thought I could replace $.ajax  with  function(){ }
[14:59:36] <falieson> <--- nob
[14:59:41] <falieson> *noob even
[15:00:14] <Shadeness> What's that 2x2 framed CSS JS Html testbed and output site? (yes this has nothing to do with jquery)
[15:00:28] <gnarf> jsfiddle
[15:00:31] <Shadeness> danke
[15:00:58] <falieson> gnarf: adding that back in fixed the errors, thanks
[15:01:56] <JuJuBee> gnarf: that made no difference
[15:02:22] <gnarf> JuJuBee: it obviously works in the fiddle, correct?
[15:02:48] <gnarf> JuJuBee: try posting to a google like i did in the fiddle, see if you see it
[15:04:05] <JuJuBee> gnarf: so that work, but why doesn't when I post to my page?
[15:04:21] <gnarf> JuJuBee: sounds like you have an issue with your page
[15:04:35] <gnarf> JuJuBee: try just var_dump($_POST)
[15:05:06] <gnarf> php obviously
[15:07:22] <JuJuBee> gnarf: if I change the form.submit to form.submit2  (to bypass that and do normal post), it works fine.  I get the POST vars.  Something not going through from the jConfirm...
[15:08:07] <gnarf> JuJuBee: oh
[15:08:12] <gnarf> clicking on the submit button
[15:08:19] <gnarf> thats what adds it
[15:08:33] <gnarf> so add <input type="hidden" value="Yup">
[15:08:51] <gnarf> or even <input type="hidden" name="submitButton" value="Ok">
[15:09:31] <gnarf> JuJuBee: since you aren't submitting by clicking on the button anymore (you're using .submit() instead) - that buttons value isn't POSTEd
[15:11:21] <gnarf> if you needed to add it
[15:11:29] <gnarf> you could always inject it with a hidden
[15:13:57] <crash21> guys how to do this? $('#datepicker').live('load', function() { ...
[15:14:02] <crash21> load event dont seem to work
[15:14:10] <falieson> gnarf: well the script doens't actually seem to be sending an email after validation. I included all the code except boxy since it shouldn't really matter. http://jsfiddle.net/khR8F/
[15:14:12] <crash21> or ready
[15:14:32] <JuJuBee> gnarf: sorry, my network dropped my connection...
[15:15:19] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/43f3526dfe8bac517c74
[15:15:48] <gnarf> JuJuBee: that make sense?
[15:18:10] <JuJuBee> like http://pastebin.com/2pHCktN1
[15:19:05] <gnarf> JuJuBee: the submitButton is never getting set
[15:19:15] <gnarf> thats why you aren't seeing the vardump
[15:19:40] <gnarf> JuJuBee: submit <inputs> are only a part of the form values if they are the thing creating the submit
[15:20:00] <gnarf> but now that the jConfirm "ok" button creates it - no "submitButton" in your $_POST
[15:20:15] <crash21> any ideas how to use live on ready or on load?
[15:20:28] <JuJuBee> gnarf I understand.  I changed the post['submitButton'] to post['submit']
[15:20:38] <JuJuBee> I still do not get the var_dump
[15:21:13] <gnarf> JuJuBee: take the var dump out of the if
[15:21:26] <gnarf> JuJuBee: don't have an input named "submit" either
[15:21:29] <gnarf> it totally breaks shit
[15:21:36] <gnarf> like form.submit() from javascript
[15:21:38] <gnarf> :)
[15:24:23] <JuJuBee> yippppeeeee  Thanks Heaps.... working now...
[15:24:41] <JuJuBee> I forgot that the submit button doesn't pass through the jConfirm.
[15:26:46] <crash21> can i use on delegate event load or ready?
[15:28:52] <falieson> I added everything after errorPlacement (starting with the success: ) and validation doesn't work nor does the actual email submission. can someone help please? http://jsfiddle.net/khR8F/3/
[15:30:13] <gnarf> JuJuBee: no problem, sorry i didn't get you straighter to the solution ;) -- forms are tricky beasts
[15:31:43] <zamba> hi there, i have a challenge here.. i'm creating a form for adding a team to a tournament.. and to validate the input, i'm using the validate plugin.. but one of the validations is making sure that several rows of input are unique.. can the validation plugin do that?
[15:32:18] <falieson> gnarf: haha... i'm battling my own form. such a B =(
[15:32:56] <StevePC> what js libraries should I look at to abstract away w3c sql databases client side so it looks like active record or similar?
[15:34:55] <JuJuBee> gnarf: Yes, I see that.  I usually use ajax to continue the post, but in this case I didn't want to use it.
[15:41:25] <zamba> i have a set of form input fields that i want to make sure contains unique values.. how can i do a client-side validation of that, and especially how do i integrate that into the validation plugin?
[15:41:48] <gnarf> JuJuBee: just glad to help :)
[15:44:16] <falieson> zamba: what do you mean by unique values? like somethign that doesn't already exist in your db?
[15:48:34] <zamba> falieson: no, this is client-side
[15:48:37] <zamba> falieson: so it's not ajax
[15:48:51] <falieson> my question was whta do you mean by unique
[15:48:58] <zamba> falieson: i just want to make sure that the user doesn't write the same value in two or more input fields
[15:49:01] <zamba> (it's a number)
[15:49:05] <falieson> k
[15:49:37] <falieson> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions
[15:49:48] <falieson> create a rule that makes sure all the vars aren't equal
[15:49:59] <falieson> *any of the vars aren't equal to each other
[15:50:45] <zamba> falieson: hm?
[15:50:51] <zamba> falieson: that's kind of what i'm asking ;)
[15:50:58] <zamba> falieson: how to do it..
[15:52:21] <falieson> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3571347/how-to-add-a-not-equal-to-rule-in-jquery-validation
[15:53:27] <zamba> falieson: oh, ok, so then i have to write something that checks all the other input fields
[15:55:37] <falieson> right
[15:55:52] <falieson> there is probably a fast way to make sure that none of them are equal to each other, I'm not a great coder either
[15:56:08] <falieson> like a loop or something
[15:56:28] <zamba> yeah, just have to loop through all the items of the same type (except the current one) and check the value
[15:57:59] <crash21> if an element have a return confirm on on click event, is there its answer saved somewhere on the elements attributes?
[16:00:58] <noazark> Is there some kind of maximum length for serialzing form data? I've got a lengthy form that fails to serialize properly after a certain number of fields.
[16:10:30] <eddiemonge> noazark: i think its 2gb
[16:11:25] <noazark> hmmm.. I'm certainly not reaching that.
[16:19:46] <eddiemonge> code?
[16:20:53] <crash21> is there a way to use delegate or live and use event ready or load?
[16:22:23] <Kamakazi> is there anyway to make it so that Jquery UI opening a dialog on top of another dialog automatically places them side by side?
[16:22:46] <eddiemonge> crash21: yes you can use delegate and live inside a .ready() block
[16:23:08] <eddiemonge> Kamakazi: ugh thats bad ui but it is possible, just not easily
[16:23:41] <Kamakazi> eddiemonge: I want to use it for context sensitive help, if they need help with the form it just pops up right beside it
[16:24:29] <eddiemonge> eww. why not just expand the dialog with another column
[16:25:10] <Kamakazi> that would work
[16:27:54] <Kamakazi> if I'm using divs in the modal I assume the easiest way to add a column would be float one left and one right?
[16:29:02] <eddiemonge> sure
[16:37:43] <zamba> i solved it like this (suggestions and smarter ways of solving the same are welcome!): http://jsfiddle.net/tgrym/
[16:41:48] <eddiemonge> i hate ruby

[21:15:57] <coldhead> there is a story i just made up where einstein hands his copy of the C++ manual back to it's author and says "i refuse to believe the human mind is this complex"
[21:16:07] <abjorn> lol
[21:16:09] <abjorn> well
[21:16:22] <abjorn> the point of writing c++ in this case
[21:16:25] <abjorn> is for gamez
[21:16:36] <abjorn> im workin on my native javascript engine
[21:16:40] <abjorn> so then people can write games
[21:16:43] <abjorn> that are native
[21:16:45] <abjorn> in jaboscirpt
[21:17:18] <coldhead> oh
[21:17:27] <coldhead> that's actually a very good explanation
[21:17:42] <coldhead> are you sure you've had enough to drink?
[21:18:07] <abjorn> no
[21:18:08] <abjorn> i havent
[21:18:17] <abjorn> but i ran out
[21:18:25] <abjorn> can only get so much when you're underage
[21:18:38] <abjorn> see on that
[21:18:39] <abjorn> chart
[21:18:45] <abjorn> i havent hit the peak yet
[21:21:04] <coldhead> you're... young?
[21:21:19] <coldhead> i can't believe i've cybered you!
[21:21:28] <coldhead> i feel so unclean
[21:22:03] <chjj> jabathehutscript?
[21:22:24] <abjorn> no
[21:22:26] <abjorn> jaboscript
[21:22:31] <abjorn> coldhead knows
[21:22:32] <abjorn> he knows
[21:22:37] <abjorn> yeah im 20, WHAT OF IT
[21:23:45] <coldhead> last time i buy YOU a drink
[21:24:01] <coldhead> you know in my country you would have been legally passed out in the gutter for TWO YEARS
[21:24:13] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, obama
[21:24:18] <abjorn> lolll
[21:24:26] <abjorn> Drinking legally should be based on whether you have a high school diploma or not
[21:25:04] <abjorn> i deserve to drink. my ex does not
[21:25:53] <bbrandon> i don't deserve to drink
[21:26:24] <abjorn> no

[22:07:38] <falieson> can someone have a look at this and tell me why it's not working? http://jsfiddle.net/PVmbB/1/
[22:08:03] <falieson> its supposed to hide one div by default, and replace it when another div is clicked
[22:11:17] <josh9>  javascript
[22:11:26] <falieson> ?
[22:11:50] <DrkShadow> Why does the datepicker show up see-through?
[22:21:13] <falieson>  http://jsfiddle.net/PVmbB/1/ can someone take a peak and tell me why my onClick show() / hide () doesn't work?
[22:27:04] <Spadeski> ok basically i have an extra tag on html element as block_id I need to get the id with jquery how do i do it ?
[22:32:20] <falieson> from what i've learned  you do something like this... but people in this room said I was umb or something... they oculdn't explain to me why it was wrong
[22:33:12] <falieson> (one sec, looken for the fiddle)
[22:33:59] <falieson> Spadeski: http://jsfiddle.net/xar73/
[22:34:16] <Spadeski> checking it out
[22:34:33] <falieson> i couldn't get it to work but from what I understand you implement it something like that div[data-side="L"] type
[22:35:37] <DrkShadow> So, anyone on why the datepicker has no background?
[22:35:45] <DrkShadow> or anything else for that matter.. theme is smoothness.
[22:37:02] <falieson> DrkShadow: you might not be getting responses because people aren't clear what you're talking about, always best to post some code
[22:37:19] <DrkShadow> nggghhh.... ergh. <link href="..." not src..
[22:37:46] <Spadeski> falieson:  internet i s too slow too load it
[22:37:52] <falieson> spadesk
[22:37:53] <falieson> lol
[22:38:03] <Spadeski> lol
[22:50:30] <RobertV> when you dynamically insert some javascript into the dom, is there something you need to do to "activate" it? i'm inserting <div onclick="f()"></div> in response to some action, but the DIV doesn't responde to clicks.
[23:04:56] <Spadeski>  /join #hl2
[23:29:17] <ragas> ive got an element on my page of class connect_widget, and Im trying to hide it with $('.connect_widget').hide(); but it wont go away.
[23:36:08] <gf3> lies
[23:36:13] <gf3> ragas: jsfiddle
[23:43:32] <ragas> oh, it looks like the element im trying to hide is embedded in a facebook iframe.
[23:49:42] <ragas> can i override a stlye inside an iframe?
[23:53:49] <Hannibal_Lecter> no you can't
[23:59:14] <dexter_e> Is there an easy way to monitor Loading Errors on the entire page with jQuery?     I see $('body').error()  but that doesn't seem to work.
