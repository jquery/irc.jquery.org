[00:00:36] <Already> hi
[00:01:39] <bobdobbs`> Cork: 'sum' is a variable, that starts with the value of zero.
[00:02:13] <Cork> ?eval var sum = 0; sum = sum + "10"; sum;
[00:02:14] <bot-t> Cork: "010"
[00:02:17] <Cork> bobdobbs`: ^
[00:02:19] <bobdobbs`> hmm
[00:02:48] <Cork> "10" is what you get from .val(), or rather you always get a string from input fields
[00:03:31] <bobdobbs`> oh dang
[00:03:48] <bobdobbs`> I guess there's a way to cast the string to a number?
[00:03:51] <bobdobbs`> googling...
[00:03:56] <Cork> bobdobbs`: in js, if you have two data sources of different types, js always converts everything to string
[00:04:06] <Cork> bobdobbs`: i just showed you a while ago
[00:04:15] <Cork> ?eval var sum = 0; sum = sum + parseInt("10", 10); sum;
[00:04:16] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[00:04:20] <Cork> ?eval var sum = 0; sum = sum + parseInt("100", 10); sum;
[00:04:21] <bot-t> Cork: 100
[00:04:39] <Cork> and for completeness
[00:04:56] <Cork> ?eval var sum = 0; sum = sum + {}; sum
[00:04:57] <bot-t> Cork: "0[object Object]"
[00:05:20] <bobdobbs`> hmmm
[00:05:23] <bobdobbs`> thanks.
[00:05:28] <Cork> thats why you get [Object Object] if you alert an object
[00:05:28] <bobdobbs`> I think I get it.
[00:09:31] <ISDP> http://jsfiddle.net/Gfekt/2/ why does the div not show?
[00:11:34] <ISDP> or even better, why doesn't it hide? http://jsfiddle.net/Gfekt/3/
[00:13:05] <bobdobbs`> Cork: heh, sorry. I forgot to thank you. Thanks for the pointers :)
[00:13:15] <Cork> heh yrw
[00:14:29] <Cork> ISDP: your defining a function in an onload function, and tries to call it from the global scope
[00:14:59] <Cork> ISDP: http://jsfiddle.net/Gfekt/5/
[00:15:36] <Cork> ISDP: and thats one of the reasons why you shouldn't use inline event attributes
[00:15:43] <Cork> use modern event listeners
[00:30:49] <ISDP> Cork: next issue... http://jsfiddle.net/Gfekt/7/
[00:31:28] <erdos> hey there jquery people
[00:31:42] <erdos> i was wondering if someone could give me a bit of guidance with debugging
[00:32:43] <Already> What kind of guidance?
[00:33:33] <erdos> i'm looking at this page: http://www.coteetciel.com/boutique/hard-shells.html#product316 , i want to know where in their code they define the scrolling action when you click on the pictures... i inspect the element in chrome dev tools and look at the event listeners, there's click, but i can't make any sense out of it?
[00:33:59] <erdos> i just want to trace back and figure out how they did it, but i always end up stuck in some part of a minified jquery file, not knowing where to go
[00:35:56] <ISDP> http://i.imgur.com/8udyj.png tables and divs are annoying
[00:38:06] <erdos> Already: thoughts? do you know what i'm trying to do here? do you ever do this?
[00:40:37] <erdos> basically i think i just need to better understand what the things under the "Event Listeners" section ( https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/elements ) mean, but i wouldn't have a clue where to start
[00:41:57] <Already> I never really did that kind of reverse engineering. That's not debugging. ;)
[00:42:39] <erdos> oh right, dang! mostly i just want to see the little snippet of their code to figure out how they achieved something
[00:42:57] <erdos> so if i did this i'd be reverse engineering, how l33t!
[00:44:13] <gym_jane> hi all
[00:44:32] <gym_jane> how can I capture the text entered into a search box with jquery?
[00:44:56] <erdos> $("searchbox").val()
[00:45:26] <gym_jane> thank you
[00:45:30] <erdos> np
[00:46:15] <gym_jane> just to confirm. I have a generic value i.e. "search here" but I want to capture what the user types, would that still work ?
[00:46:27] <Already> Still it's pretty straight forward erdos. Just look at the Page Source. I'd guess you want to see how they're displaying thae item information? Probably it's the bunch of code that starts with $slides(document).ready(function() {
[00:48:25] <erdos> i've tried just reading the code to do this sort of stuff but sometimes these pages can turn into apps, i really want to master the debugger so i can look at what events are bound to elements, pause when those events are fired, and look back down the call stack
[00:48:36] <erdos> although i don't have the slightest idea how to do such i thing
[00:48:51] <erdos> i need a book entitled "javascript reverse engineering with chrome developer tools"
[00:49:00] <erdos> that would be great if someone would like to write that for me
[00:49:11] <erdos> i'd definitely pay at least $19.95
[00:49:48] <erdos> gym_jane: if the value of your input field is "search here" by default, .val() will still return that
[00:49:54] <Already> How about just developing your own code? ;)
[00:50:00] <erdos> i DO!
[00:50:09] <erdos> i don't want to steal other people code!
[00:50:13] <erdos> i want to learn from them!
[00:50:43] <erdos> shiiiiit
[00:52:03] <erdos> gym_jane: i usually have <input type="text" value="search here" class="touched" />, remove the "touched" class on focus of the element, when you're processing the text check if the element has the "touched" class, if yes, treat the val as null, if not, grab the value with .val()
[00:52:08] <gym_jane> erdos here is what I got http://pastebin.com/xq9B1etQ
[00:52:53] <erdos> blech, onfocus? go pick up a book on jquery
[00:53:06] <erdos> the whole point of jquery is to avoid stuff like that
[00:53:25] <gym_jane> I want the value typed by user to be pushed to  <input type="submit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Homepage Search Bar', 'Submit', 'i want the value here'])"
[00:53:35] <Already> DOn't get me wrong erdos but sometimes it might just be easier to develop your own code than to reverse engineer someones code and trying to understand whatever strange thoughts he had.
[00:54:49] <iSeeDeadPixels> does anyone know why this happens? http://i.imgur.com/8udyj.png
[00:54:54] <Already> why don't you just read it rigth there? $("someelement").val() insteadt of 'I want the value here'
[00:55:16] <erdos> yeah i know, but i find myself constantly being given briefs from graphic designers saying "make it look like this", usually i just find the plugin.js file, look at what plugins they're using and figure it out from there, but sometimes they write it themselves! then i become obsessed trying to figure it out, i just want to sharpen my skills with the debugger
[00:56:37] <Already> Oh OK. Well sorry I can't really give you anyone pointers on how to venture into unkown code using the debugger. I've seldomly done that.
[00:56:47] <erdos> hehe that's cool
[00:57:05] <erdos> i'll keep looking on the google, i'm sure someone's written something about it somewhere
[00:57:29] <erdos> the thing is i feel like i'm THAT close to getting it figured
[01:05:44] <bobdobbs`> Cork: you still around?
[01:06:07] <bobdobbs`> When I add two numbers together, my result is NaN
[01:06:22] <bobdobbs`> This is a snippet from what I'm doing: http://pastebin.com/hbjvJmUi
[01:06:44] <bobdobbs`> If I enter that snippet in my console, I get NaN
[01:07:06] <bobdobbs`> oh wait
[01:07:09] <bobdobbs`> pft
[01:07:19] <bobdobbs`> don't worry. I see what I'm doing wrong
[01:20:20] <xevi> hi, I have a simple call to a controller delete function, but it's not working and I don't know why, can somebody help me please? http://pastebin.com/rcy1BS4C
[01:22:12] <DrPoole> Hello.
[01:22:28] <DrPoole> I think this explains it all -> http://imgur.com/XwTcq
[01:22:32] <DrPoole> (it really doesnt)
[01:23:01] <DrPoole> i have a feed from an external source returning me an array with 3 keys and inside each an unknown amount of entries.
[01:23:19] <DrPoole> i have them in a div that can scroll
[01:23:41] <DrPoole> and i want to center those 3 items on the pink one (it's actually [yesterday][today][tomorrow])
[01:24:09] <DrPoole> i know the width of each "section" and the width of the whole.
[01:24:51] <DrPoole> sorry ... i want to center the div's scroll on the pink (today) entries.
[01:27:59] <deerjohn> hello world
[01:28:07] <deerjohn> how do i remove #contenu-index div
[01:28:20] <deerjohn> and then re-create it later dynamically ?
[01:28:31] <deerjohn> with its id="contenu-index"
[01:30:34] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/5YVTg/ how to combine the two events?
[01:31:12] <Cork> deerjohn: you should prob not remove it, if you want it back later the correct solution is to just hide it .hide() (display: none)
[01:31:38] <deerjohn> really, will it not conflit with div id being duplicates ?
[01:31:52] <Cork> yes it will
[01:32:14] <Cork> but you should never have multiple elements with the same id
[01:32:26] <deerjohn> dammit :(
[01:32:46] <Cork> boulet101010: as you need to check keyCode in one of them; you can't
[01:33:04] <Cork> boulet101010: use a function that you put your common actions in and call that function from each event handler
[01:33:52] <boulet101010> ok that's what i though
[01:34:04] <boulet101010> thought*
[01:34:12] <Cork> boulet101010: actually, on second thought
[01:34:13] <Cork> there is a way
[01:34:26] <boulet101010> ?_¿
[01:34:27] <bot-t> boulet101010, domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[01:34:57] <Cork> boulet101010: http://jsfiddle.net/5YVTg/1/
[01:35:44] <Cork> boulet101010: you should ALWAYS have a form
[01:35:57] <Cork> cause browsers does a lot of special handling of forms
[01:36:11] <boulet101010> i knew that ^^
[01:36:14] <boulet101010> but
[01:36:33] <boulet101010> how to change the key that submits a textzone?
[01:36:51] <Cork> what do you mean?
[01:37:14] <Cork> enter in textareas shouldn't submit the form
[01:37:46] <boulet101010> eww bo
[01:37:47] <boulet101010> no
[01:38:17] <boulet101010> i meant in the input
[01:38:32] <Cork> enter in input elements submit the form by default
[01:38:46] <Cork> you don't need to special case that at all
[01:38:51] <boulet101010> ok
[01:39:15] <boulet101010> so "accesskey" attribute has nothing to do with that?
[01:39:36] <Cork> thats for focusing the element
[01:39:58] <Cork> accesskey was standardized in html5 right?
[01:40:02] <boulet101010> yeah that's what i thought
[01:40:11] <Cork> i have a vague memory of that
[01:40:16] <boulet101010> (don't know about standardization of acceskey)
[01:40:27] <Cork> ?mdn accesskey attribute
[01:40:29] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn accesskey attribute" in jQuery Docs.
[01:40:40] <Cork> ?g mdn accesskey attribute
[01:40:42] <bot-t> Cork, accesskey | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/Attribute/accesskey
[01:40:52] <Cork> uh...
[01:40:55] <Cork> xul...
[01:41:04] <boulet101010> =(
[01:41:13] <Cork> ?g mdn html accesskey attribute
[01:41:15] <bot-t> Cork, accesskey | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/Attribute/accesskey
[01:41:24] <Cork> nope thats not supported in html at all
[01:42:28] <Already> Should be before HTML5 and accesskey, as far as i understand, ist meant for quick access and helping disabled people. Just that it was limited in HTML 4 if we can trust http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp
[01:42:52] <Cork> you can't
[01:43:15] <Cork> Already: you should always ignore everything that comes from that site
[01:44:00] <Already> http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2
[01:44:15] <Cork> much better :)
[01:44:20] <Already> If i can't trust w3 i'd be lost
[01:45:12] <bobdobbs`> in js, can functions have private member variables?
[01:45:28] <Cork> interesting that that is missing completely from the mozilla wiki
[01:45:34] <Cork> bobdobbs`: no
[01:45:39] <bobdobbs`> damn
[01:45:49] <Cork> you have local scope, and inherited scope
[01:45:54] <Cork> and global scope
[01:46:04] <Cork> (thats actually just a form of inherited scope)
[01:46:23] <Cork> bobdobbs`: what is it you need to do?
[01:48:11] <iSeeDeadPixels> :c
[01:48:17] <bobdobbs`> Cork: basically, do some maths. :\
[01:48:34] <bobdobbs`> I'm making a calculator of sorts.
[01:49:04] <Already> eeeee
[01:49:05] <bobdobbs`> For the part of the calculator that I'm working on, I have to think about scoping issues
[01:49:15] <bobdobbs`> I don't like thinking

[01:49:40] <juha_> iSeeDeadPixels: that is a value, not object
[01:49:48] <juha_> also wut, that should work :D
[01:50:09] <iSeeDeadPixels> it obviously doesn't ><
[01:51:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> $("#frmSummary span[data-name=\"" + fName + "\"]").replaceWith("<span style=\"float:left;\">" + fName + " " + fVal + "</span><span style=\"float: right;\" data-price=\""+ fPrice +"\">&euro; "+ fPrice.toFixed(2) +"</span>");
[01:52:18] <bobdobbs`> Cork: I've got this within a function: http://pastebin.com/xnbvdk6J
[01:52:39] <bobdobbs`> As you can see, I'm trying to add to 'sum' if a value exists.
[01:52:52] <bobdobbs`> But I'm not sure how to get to 'sum' from the loop
[01:53:39] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: you have a clue what's going wrong htere?
[01:54:37] <PBDev> How can I write a jquery for a dropdown box?
[01:54:53] <iSeeDeadPixels> PBDev:  what do you mean?
[01:56:05] <PBDev> I want to list a group of items from the database. And hover over or select one, so I can then click delete it and remove if from the db
[01:56:28] <bobdobbs`> I guess what I'm asking is basically this: how to I access the parent scope from inside a loop ?
[01:57:29] <seutje> bobdobbs`: you always have access to the parent scope
[01:57:29] <PBDev> lol, I like your nickname. very funny. >iSeeDeadPixels
[01:57:43] <seutje> bobdobbs`: especially if you leak into the global scope like you're doing there
[01:57:53] <seutje> bobdobbs`: but you prolly want to parseInt those values
[01:58:02] <bobdobbs`> oh yeah
[01:58:20] <bobdobbs`> I'll do that...
[01:58:47] <seutje> bobdobbs`: http://jsfiddle.net/42dpv/1/
[01:59:19] <bobdobbs`> seutje: thanks
[01:59:38] <bobdobbs`> what does that '10' do?
[02:00:17] <seutje> bobdobbs`: it's the radix

[02:08:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> juha_: the price gets logged, now what?
[02:11:45] <juha_> iSeeDeadPixels: you could check the proto object from it, just for lulz to see if toFixed is there
[02:12:27] <iSeeDeadPixels> wut?
[02:12:29] <juha_> iSeeDeadPixels: you could also wrap the fPrice into number, Number(fPrice).toFixed()
[02:13:00] <adam_lynch> anyone? :/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12636739/infinite-loop-when-using-generic-solution-to-split-up-carousel-contents
[02:13:26] <seutje> iSeeDeadPixels: doesn't that attr call return a string? not sure what toFixed is, but sounds like you'd want to parseInt that
[02:13:30] <iSeeDeadPixels> juha_: that last thing worked.
[02:13:43] <seutje> juha_: isn't it better to parseInt?
[02:13:48] <seutje> or parseFloat
[02:14:27] <juha_> i guess
[02:15:17] <juha_> well i guess the attr returns it as a string and not as a float so that's why it didn't work
[02:57:32] <coppa> I there any killer web-dev from tunisia arond ? ;)
[03:27:09] <caddoo> You know If i submit a form with multiple elements of the same name
[03:27:19] <caddoo> ie, favouriteColors[]
[03:27:33] <caddoo> How can I get an array similar to that from jQuery
[03:28:59] <caddoo> like if I have favouriteColors[3] and favouriteColors[5] it treats them different, I want to group them
[03:29:51] <BlaDe^> why can't I do var array = $.map(...); array.indexOf ?
[03:33:27] <BlaDe^> here's an example: var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var test = array.map( function(a) { return a}); test.slice(test.indexOf(2), 1); test
[03:33:35] <Douilspee> hi, im' looking for a jquery slider, with ranges, variable ranges, number of items in range, and seo compatible :)
[03:33:37] <BlaDe^> it seems just using it inside .slice is where it isn't working
[03:40:20] <pangelovski> hi guys
[03:46:05] <BlaDe^> getting some weird behaviour with this code: http://pastie.org/private/qogp22mftw2elruphpeyq -- line 4 shows the correct data, line 6 -always- shows the last item in the array
[03:46:07] <BlaDe^> why is that?
[03:47:12] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: regarding indexOf...  test.indexOf(2) returns 1. for .slice end value is also 1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[03:47:38] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: slice will return new array from begin & upto end (not including end). so you are getting empty array here
[03:49:56] <BlaDe^> Ravindran:  i just looped to find it myself in the end.. indexOf was working on console but not in practice
[03:50:16] <BlaDe^> Ravindran:  http://pastie.org/private/h3u8tsvk3onq60e9xt8nq
[03:53:11] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: line 13 - loading.splice(idx, 1); shd be replaced with loading = loading.splice(idx, 1); //splice doesn't alter the original array
[03:54:17] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: Minor correction. it shd be loading = loading.splice(idx, idx+1);
[03:54:56] <mllie> hello
[03:55:05] <mllie> Anyone that have experience from flowplayer in here?
[03:55:52] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: what is the other problem with the code? img tag is not inserted / img not displayed?
[03:56:10] <BlaDe^> no that works, it's just they're all the same image
[03:56:30] <BlaDe^> line 14 shows a different image every time as expected, the callback in .fadeOut shows the same image every time (line 16 is the log)
[04:02:00] <BlaDe^> any ideas Ravindran  ? :)
[04:03:58] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: no idea. still thinking
[04:04:48] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: can you try to get the spinner jquer object again before fadeOut here?
[04:05:38] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm wondering if anyone of you have any experience authentication against a rest web service from a query app?
[04:07:44] <BlaDe^> Ravindran: the spinner object is different every time, the img object is the same
[04:08:35] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: can you try create a jsfiddle so that this can be easily experimented?
[04:08:48] <BlaDe^> Ravindran:  can I notice you the link so you can see the console output? maybe it'll help
[04:09:41] <rgr> Im looking for an approach/fix for this situation : I us hovers on screen elements to put up a toolbar on the element in "admin mode". Each element has various editble fields. sing jquery.jeditable I can edit text in place. The problem comes with a datepicker from jquery-ui. its attached to a relative positioned div and fired by a click. Unfortunately its appearing *under* the border of the next major element. Now the date picker has a
[04:09:42] <rgr> z index of 9999 or something and the next element whose border covers it is 1 ... Any ideas? And while at it, how can I make the datepicker modal?

[04:19:04] <BlaDe^> hi seutje
[04:25:33] <BlaDe^> Ravindran: i just wrapped it in a closure... (function(img) { ... })(img) and it fixed it :S
[04:25:56] <Ravindran> BlaDe^: gr8
[04:26:05] <BlaDe^> thanks for your tim!
[04:26:06] <BlaDe^> time*
[04:34:38] <Cork> BlaDe^: you might want to try using a separate variable instead, that might be cheaper then a full scope
[04:35:04] <Cork> on the other hand, unless you loop thousands of times, it won't matter
[04:47:28] <BlaDe^> Cork: /window 15
[04:47:30] <BlaDe^> oops
[04:47:39] <Cork> ?
[04:51:00] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm having a weird issue...
[04:51:42] <code_ph0y> hey guys ... have a question .. i have a click event on an element ... and I wanna add a class to the element clicked .... i have something like ... event.target.addClass('tab_active');
[04:51:51] <code_ph0y> am i doing that wrong
[04:52:16] <Cork> $(this).addClass('tab_active')
[04:52:18] <code_ph0y> $(this).click(function(event) { <<< thats my entry point
[04:52:36] <Cork> whats this there?
[04:52:44] <Cork> your looping over tabs?
[04:52:55] <code_ph0y> yeah two secs
[04:53:02] <Cork> ?p @ code_ph0y
[04:53:03] <bot-t> code_ph0y, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:53:30] <code_ph0y> thanks bud i was doing everything to not paste bin haha
[04:53:31] <code_ph0y> two mins
[04:54:25] <Fleudje> guys, i got a question which i have been looking for multiple hours now and i don't get it fixed.. I'm using the slideDown function with speed 400 and easing 'linear', which seems pretty normal. But actually it takes 400ms to slide down but the effect is that first you see a short while nothing and then the whole div opens at once.. anyone familiar with this problem?
[04:55:14] <Cork> Fleudje: classic, it depends on the css you're using for the element
[04:55:37] <code_ph0y> Cork: http://pastebin.com/DCcdhwKh ... thanks bud
[04:55:42] <Fleudje> ah, good to hear it's something classic :-)
[04:55:53] <Cork> i don't remember what causes the effect straight of my head, so i would need a link to tell why
[04:56:13] <Cork> Felix: but play with display: and overflow: hidden
[04:56:14] <Fleudje> np, i have a staging environment, allowed to paste in here?
[04:56:26] <Cork> links sure
[04:56:31] <Cork> not code
[04:56:46] <Fleudje> http://staging.kei-bv.nl/ <- it happens when you click on 'Over KEI' - trigger the effect, click it again to slideUp
[04:58:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://jsfiddle.net/wF5A3/2/ now why doesn't it work in jsfiddle, but kinda does on my html page..
[04:58:18] <Cork> code_ph0y: http://pastebin.com/bs6pRJgK
[04:59:30] <bobdobbs`> how do I make the validation plugin require a number from an input?
[04:59:31] <bobdobbs`> I've found a doc page for this purpose, but I can't get it working myself
[04:59:31] <bobdobbs`> The doc page is here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/number
[05:00:29] <Cork> Fleudje: cssefectos.css:73 => .pagina_expanded { min-height: 300px; }
[05:00:34] <Cork> Fleudje: thats why it fails
[05:00:47] <Cork> remove that part and the animation will work
[05:00:52] <Fleudje> cool, let me check
[05:01:53] <code_ph0y> Cork!
[05:02:02] <Fleudje> can you also explain me how you found out? i'm quite experienced with php etc, but this one was a bit too hard to find out
[05:02:08] <Fleudje> will help in the future :)
[05:03:02] <code_ph0y> totes amazing ... but am puzzled!
[05:03:02] <Cork> Fleudje: 1. inspected the element, 2. clicked the element, 3. saw what css that changes (it should work), 4. opened the related css tab and saw that rule, 5. disabled the min-height rule
[05:03:10] <code_ph0y> that shouldn't work :S
[05:03:25] <Cork> code_ph0y: it should
[05:03:39] <Cork> thats how you write jquery selector and actions
[05:03:50] <Fleudje> hehe oke :)
[05:03:55] <Fleudje> it works indeed, great, thanks a lot :-)
[05:03:57] <Fleudje> saves the day :)
[05:04:01] <Cork> np
[05:04:26] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: have you tried if you change the select option on the left to "no wrap (head)" ?
[05:04:38] <Cork> i'm not sure what "doesn't work" so...
[05:04:50] <Cork> would be good if you explained whats expected on that page
[05:04:51] <code_ph0y> tech it doesn't work but I love that you have re factored my code :P ... its adding the class but not removing them every time they are clicked
[05:04:51] * AdamPDotty works
[05:05:10] <Cork> code_ph0y: neither did your code :)
[05:05:24] <code_ph0y> yeah am not complaining bud!
[05:05:29] <code_ph0y> its amazing!
[05:05:51] <code_ph0y> am still stumped how the each is working but?
[05:05:59] <Cork> code_ph0y: just run the remove part on each click event and your done
[05:06:00] <code_ph0y> when the each isn't there?
[05:06:18] <code_ph0y> yeah done that
[05:06:30] <Cork> code_ph0y: the selector ('.learner_tabs div') builds and array
[05:06:40] <Cork> each loops over each element in that array
[05:06:51] <Cork> then you run removeClass on each element at a time
[05:06:59] <Cork> and binds a click event listener
[05:07:07] <Cork> the code i posted you does:
[05:07:25] <Cork> it builds the array removeClass on all elements in the array
[05:07:37] <Cork> and then binds a click event listener on all elements in the array
[05:07:53] <Cork> so your just doing a loop thats not needed, thats all
[05:08:39] <code_ph0y> ahhhh ok!
[05:08:51] <code_ph0y> i'll remember that!
[05:08:58] <code_ph0y> thanks bud
[05:09:02] <Cork> np

[05:25:12] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I would like to execute a javascript function every x seconds. How can I do that? I can put an infinite loop in $('document').ready(function(){...}), but won't that block all other javascript execution?
[05:25:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: changing rages
[05:25:21] <iSeeDeadPixels> changing pages*
[05:25:58] <Cork> ?g mdn setTimeout @ SmokeyD
[05:26:11] <SmokeyD> Cork, ah, ok. Thanks
[05:26:16] <Cork> aaand, the bot is down again
[05:26:21] <AdamPDotty> setInterval?
[05:26:31] <Cork> setInterval is most of the time a bad choice
[05:27:03] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: when i want to press << Vorige on the second page it doesn't change the divs
[05:27:39] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: "change page"?
[05:27:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> yes
[05:28:02] <kzrdt> I have problems trying to select an element
[05:28:03] <kzrdt> http://pastebin.com/FmGU4NP3
[05:28:32] <seutje> AdamPDotty: isn't setinterval prone to leaking memory on IE?
[05:28:47] <AdamPDotty> whats IE?
[05:28:49] <kzrdt> I want to select the #ficheActivite_domaineActivite_rome1stratpc element by the class on a select change
[05:29:21] <kzrdt> but I don't suceed to access to div .row
[05:29:23] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: ok, like i said before the dropdown on the left, change that to  "no wrap (head)" http://jsfiddle.net/wF5A3/3/
[05:29:56] <kzrdt> by $(this).parent().next('div.row')
[05:30:05] <seutje> AdamPDotty: actually, it also occurs in V8
[05:31:34] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork, now all pages switch but in my browser it does not :(
[05:32:04] <Cork> well wwfm
[05:32:10] <Cork> *wfm
[05:33:39] <Cork> seutje: you know that jquery's animation is based around setInterval right *whistles*
[05:33:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> pfff
[05:34:42] <seutje> Cork: yeah, just saying, it's prone to leak memory when you don't massage it
[05:35:10] <seutje> just look at fx.stop
[05:35:12] <Cork> seutje: its prone to a lot of made problems
[05:35:24] <Cork> well mad and bad ;P
[05:36:30] <Cork> and most of the time its just better to have a sane setTimeout loop instead, as that gives you much more reliable control of what happens
[05:45:48] <phrearch> hey
[05:46:34] <phrearch> is it possible to do chaining like this? .after an element after the selector, and then wrap both ?
[05:46:48] <phrearch> or should i use a seperate selector for that?
[05:47:31] <Cork> phrearch: simplest is prob to after the wrapper
[05:47:35] <Cork> and then append both inside it
[05:48:30] <Cork> var wrapper = '<div class="wrapper"/>'; $(org).after(wrapper); wrapper.append($(org)).append(new);
[05:48:35] <Cork> opps
[05:48:41] <Cork> var wrapper = $('<div class="wrapper"/>'); $(org).after(wrapper); wrapper.append($(org)).append(new);
[05:49:18] <phrearch> Cork: thanks, ill give that a try
[05:50:45] <phrearch> there are multiple $(org) results though
[05:51:26] <Cork> then you would have to loop them with each
[05:52:57] <Cork> ya, theres no generic way to do both the after and wrap without an each loop
[05:53:08] <Cork> at least not that i can think of at least :)
[05:53:22] <Cork> *not that i can think of at least
[05:53:36] <phrearch> this seems to work :)
[05:53:38] <phrearch> thanks
[05:53:42] <Cork> np
[05:56:11] <bobdobbs> I cannot for the life me get the jquery validation plugin to strictly require numbers. I'm stumped.
[05:56:35] <bobdobbs> My code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/EgsuG/
[05:57:19] <bobdobbs> Am I missing something?
[06:05:21] <converge> can someone help me to fix it ? http://cl.ly/image/311R0T1O431q I dont know why the argument is not passed to ajaxMsg function
[06:07:41] <seutje> converge: is it in the header?
[06:08:03] <converge> seutje: yes, im just testing for now
[06:12:17] <seutje> well if it's in the header, it's being sent, so the rest is up to your php app
[06:12:44] <johnkpaul> converge: I'm guessing this is zend?
[06:12:52] <johnkpaul> zend layout's have content type text/html IIRC
[06:12:59] <johnkpaul> you need to explictly set it to application/json
[06:13:18] <converge> johnathanb: it's cakephp, I just foud the solution
[06:13:34] <converge> I needed that $id = $this->request->data['sku'];
[06:13:35] <johnathanb> johnkpaul ^^
[06:13:51] <johnkpaul> ah ok
[06:14:48] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I have created tabs with jquery-ui's .tabs(). I want to reload the content of a tab. I do this by .tabs('load',index)
[06:15:04] <SmokeyD> but somehow this doesn't seem to reload the page from the server
[06:15:30] <SmokeyD> at least not when index is the index of the currently visible tab
[06:15:58] <SmokeyD> how can I force the tab content to be fetched again from the server?
[06:19:40] <john-dev> hey, is it possible to track changes of an array with jquery?
[06:20:04] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: I don't think that the functionality is offered using the public api for tabs
[06:20:26] <johnkpaul> looking through the soruce, you can call .url(index,oldURL) and it will reset the cache
[06:20:31] <phrearch> whats the easiest way to change an element from a 'p' to a 'span' using jquery?
[06:20:32] <johnkpaul> or you can use this extension http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2624228/jquery-ui-tabs-caching
[06:20:43] <johnkpaul> john-dev: no, jquery doesn't have data binding like that
[06:20:51] <johnkpaul> john-dev: look into knockout if you want something lightweight
[06:21:06] <johnkpaul> ?unwrap @phrearch
[06:21:07] <bot-t> phrearch, .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[06:21:09] <johnkpaul> ?wrap @ phrearch
[06:21:10] <bot-t> phrearch, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[06:21:51] <SmokeyD> johnkpaul, there should be the .tabs( "load" , index ) method, which according to the docs should reload the content of the tab.
[06:21:56] <SmokeyD> but it doesn't.
[06:21:58] <phrearch> johnkpaul: thanks
[06:22:31] <rgr> what would be the most efficient to jquery this "append item to item1 if it exists else to item2 if it exists? Some sort of select or like $(".item1class,.item2class").first().append() ?
[06:22:40] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: where does it say that it will reload from the server?
[06:22:57] <johnkpaul> rgr: :D yes, it's that _exactly_
[06:22:59] <SmokeyD> in the docs it says "This method always loads the tab content from the remote location, even if cache is set to true."
[06:23:06] <johnkpaul> ?tias @rgr
[06:23:07] <bot-t> rgr, Try It And See
[06:23:45] <rgr> Please dont tias me... Its rude and detrimental to the reason for asking human experts their views on methods and alternate methods.
[06:23:50] <rgr> but thanks
[06:23:52] <johnkpaul> hmm, SmokeyD, I see that
[06:24:00] <johnkpaul> rgr: I was not dismissiong your question
[06:24:06] <johnkpaul> I was saying that you were right in your assumption about the api
[06:24:38] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: I don't know, looking at the source of .load(), it does seem to consult the cache
[06:25:37] <johnkpaul> oh actually, SmokeyD, I am looking at an old version
[06:25:40] <johnkpaul> not the github repo
[06:25:48] <johnkpaul> what version are you using?
[06:27:50] <rgr> and, unfortunately, it wasnt what I wanted at all because since jquery 1.3+ the selector returns the objects in DOM order not in the order of the composite selector.
[06:28:24] <termite> SmokeyD: add ?ts=new Date().getTime to the end of your load() url
[06:28:28] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: http://jqueryui.com/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js does check the cache, wheras the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js does not
[06:28:53] <termite> err ?ts=new Date().getTime()
[06:29:30] <johnkpaul> rgr: try $('.itemclass1').add('.itemclass2')
[06:29:30] <termite> "?ts="+new Date().getTime;
[06:30:41] <rgr> no, still in dom order.
[06:30:47] <rgr> I'll do it explicitly. shame.
[06:38:47] <rgr> ok, Im startting to think about element ordering in my little interactive ui. Now, currently each "element" is simply a div with a few siblings inside a parent "list" div". It is not currently a ol/ul/li thing. The elements are chucked out from a database by php based on an element "orderby" field. I have drag and drop working to reorder them. I can then save whatever attribute the dom uses to make that persistant. Now my Q is : is this
[06:38:47] <rgr> a fair enough approach? Or should, in your opinion, I go to ol/li?
[06:41:37] <r--> lol internet
[06:49:43] <SmokeyD> johnkpaul, termite: sorry I was on the phone
[06:49:53] <SmokeyD> termite, what does the ts querystring parameter do?
[06:50:09] <SmokeyD> My webapp doesn't know that parameter
[06:52:02] <SmokeyD> johnkpaul, I am using jquery uit 1.8.18 and jquery 1.7
[06:52:06] <jacks_appendix> Hello, why does this return an empty string? http://jsfiddle.net/46Abm/
[06:53:24] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: potentially the way caching works has changed
[06:53:25] <SmokeyD> jacks_appendix, the .html() method should get a string with html as argument I think
[06:53:27] <johnkpaul> can you try upgrading?
[06:53:46] <johnkpaul> jacks_appendix: yes, SmokeyD is right, in addition, it can lso take an element, but I am confused about your question
[06:53:53] <johnkpaul> jacks_appendix: I don't see any return statement, what is returning an empty string?
[06:54:01] <Cork> JackBauer24: http://jsfiddle.net/46Abm/2/
[06:54:27] <Cork> opps
[06:54:32] <Cork> wrong nick jacks_appendix ^
[06:54:42] <jacks_appendix> I thought that if no argument is placed in html() that it's supposed to return the html belonging to the selector..
[06:55:04] <Cork> jacks_appendix: it returns the innerHTML
[06:55:16] <Cork> not the serialization of the element
[06:55:42] <anli_> Is firebug discontinued? Cant search for it in the add-ons manager
[06:55:51] <jacks_appendix> Cork, when you say serialization, do you mean a string?
[06:55:55] <Cork> anli_: nope its there
[06:56:06] <anli_> Wonder how I cannot find it then :)
[06:56:09] <jacks_appendix> anli_, update your firefox ;)
[06:56:10] <Cork> jacks_appendix: what your working with is the dom, and thats not a string
[06:56:17] <pangelovski> hi guys, in query i have a popup dialog that opens up with two buttons yes or cancel. however if i click on anywhere else on the screen the popup disappears.
[06:56:37] <Cork> jacks_appendix: in order to generate a string, you need to convert the dom object to a string; thats called serialization
[06:56:46] <anli_> oh, it did not come as a topmost search hit
[06:56:58] <anli_> Wonder how firebug itself could not be the most relevant hit :)
[06:57:06] <Cork> anli_: getfirebug.com
[06:57:15] <anli_> I just found it in the add-ons manager
[06:57:18] <jacks_appendix> Cork, hmm ok, got it. Would you know how I could serialize in js?
[06:57:38] <Cork> jacks_appendix: i gave you a working link
[06:59:08] <jacks_appendix> Cork, ahh! ok i just missed it.. you had it pre-fixed for "JackBauer24". Thank you!
[06:59:27] <Cork> jacks_appendix: ya, and i corrected that two lines below :)

[07:07:29] <jerzi> hi
[07:07:40] <jerzi> is it possible to register a click event twice?
[07:08:00] <johnkpaul> jerzi: yes
[07:08:01] <termite> SmokeyD: it keeps the browser from caching the html since the timestamp is different every time
[07:08:11] <jacks_appendix> SmokeyD, Hi SmokeyD, yes. It my original example, i was trying to get the element as a string, which is why it wasn't working. That does work though. thank you :)
[07:09:11] <jerzi> johnkpaul: I have a button to do an ajax post, but on ajax success I want to fire a qtip tooltip immediately. Problem is, I can't register the first click event inside the ajax successcallback
[07:09:38] <SmokeyD> termite, I don't get where this magic is coming from. Querystring arguments are handled by the server right? Does my server know how to handle the ts querystring argument?
[07:09:52] <johnkpaul> jerzi: why do you want do add a click event? why not fire the tooltip?
[07:10:04] <johnkpaul> SmokeyD: because if it's a diffent url every time, it wont be cached
[07:10:06] <johnkpaul> or, it shouldn't be cached
[07:10:15] <johnkpaul> your server just has to not-pay attention to it
[07:10:42] <jerzi> the qtip tooltip shows on events, usually mouseover or click
[07:11:19] <jerzi> the message to be displayed depends on success/failure of the ajax post
[07:11:50] <SmokeyD> johnkpaul, ah, ok. Now I get the trick. I can try that. I would prefer that trick over the updating of jquery/jquery-ui
[07:12:57] <jerzi> I'm trying to fit it all inside the click handler of the button: http://pastebin.com/FcqZ5y7Y
[07:12:58] <johnkpaul> jerzi: you can show them whenever you want, there's an option for it called "show"
[07:13:12] <johnkpaul> jerzi: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/reference/#show
[07:13:19] <johnkpaul> you don't have to have an event to show it
[07:16:06] <jerzi> hmm
[07:16:08] <jerzi> I'll try that
[07:18:26] <jerzi> johnkpaul: doesn't seem to work, tried leaving out the show var or 'show: {target: $(this)}'
[07:19:18] <johnkpaul> ?demo @jerzi
[07:19:19] <bot-t> jerzi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:21:19] <abisson> Hey guys… I am running into a small problem. I am using the sortable plugin in Jquery UI to do "mass" reordering. However, I want to allow the user to "cancel" all the reordering he has done. I already have an "initial" order saved into the <li> element via HTML5. Therefore, I am trying to get the list back in order according to what the initial "order" was. However, nothing appears after this function call…. http://jsfiddle.net/gNXwr/
[07:24:37] <angelazou> hi, I need to decode a html string that has %20 using jquery or javascript
[07:24:53] <angelazou> I tried the $('<div/>').html( string ).text() method
[07:25:01] <angelazou> but it didn't help at all
[07:25:53] <vlad27aug> angelazou: you have native js functions for that...encodeUri and decodeUri
[07:27:44] <angelazou> vlad27aug, like this string.encodeUri or encodeUri(string)?
[07:28:45] <jerzi> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/AnEeF/ that's the code (without the images, it's about the buttons labeled 'Voeg toe')
[07:30:36] <johnkpaul> jerzi: are you using qtip 1 or qtip 2.0?
[07:30:45] <jerzi> 2.0
[07:31:55] <ney> Hey guys, I have a problem I hope you can help me with. Here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/ as you can see in the result, only one thing works, hope you can help! :-)
[07:31:56] <angelazou> vlad27aug: decodeURI(string) didn't work
[07:32:04] <angelazou> I'm working with a string
[07:32:13] <angelazou> it's actually only portion of the existing uri
[07:32:14] <johnkpaul> jerzi: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/api/#show
[07:32:15] <angelazou> so
[07:32:21] <ney> crap
[07:32:28] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn decodeuricomponent @ angelazou
[07:32:29] <bot-t> angelazou, decodeURIComponent | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[07:32:34] <ney> wrong link! here's the updated one ; http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/1/
[07:34:32] <ney> problem is Im not sure how to select the div
[07:35:11] <johnkpaul> ney: do you want clicking on .test6 to also exepand .test8?
[07:35:30] <ney> exactly :)
[07:35:51] <ney> that's precisely what I want
[07:36:58] <jerzi> johnkpaul: thanx, I see it in the docs, still it doesn't quite seem to work yet
[07:37:28] <johnkpaul> ney: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/2/
[07:37:37] <johnkpaul> jerzi: what is the problem?
[07:37:55] <ney> omg, thanks johnkpaul !
[07:38:06] <ney> I should've gone here right away, spent so long on it :)
[07:38:40] <ney> ffs lol, was it really that simple? :S
[07:38:46] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[07:38:51] <johnkpaul> ney: only simple because I Know the API
[07:38:55] <johnkpaul> just make sure you undestand what I did
[07:39:01] <ney> I see it
[07:39:52] <ney> oh, damn, I should've made it clearer, johnkpaul: look at it now: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/3/ I need it to not expand both
[07:40:05] <ney> just one at a time
[07:40:29] <johnkpaul> ney: then add different calsses
[07:40:42] <johnkpaul> if you're adding an event to .test7, it will fire on all elements with class .test7
[07:40:45] <johnkpaul> classes*
[07:40:55] <ney> is that the only way? Because then I'll have tons of classes once I'm done
[07:41:07] <tqrst> is there a way to make jquery automatically fallback to JSONP+GET if an ajax request would result in a cross-domain request? I'm writing something that needs to talk to a server that might sometimes be deployed on the same domain, sometimes not, and I'd like to use JSON+POST when possible.
[07:41:30] <jerzi> johnkpaul: I removed the qtip code from inside the ajax function to below the ajax function (so still inside the click function of the button), specified it like this: http://pastebin.com/m179xBqm
[07:41:50] <jerzi> according to what I see in the docs, this should work?
[07:42:01] <johnkpaul> ney: it's not the only way, but it's the only way that I can tell if you need the functionality that I think you expect
[07:42:04] <mspisars> tqrst:
[07:42:05] <mspisars> yes
[07:42:10] <mspisars> it does so automatically
[07:42:14] <johnkpaul> jerzi: but you want your qtip to show after the ajax call returns, right?
[07:42:37] <tqrst> mspisars: what funciton would that be? getJSON() doesn't seem to do it, nor does ajax()
[07:42:43] <jerzi> yes directly after the call returns yes
[07:42:57] <tqrst> function*
[07:43:08] <ney> johnkpaul: the first fiddle I posted works like I want if I have a lot of instances of the same classes, you sure it wont work?
[07:43:25] <johnkpaul> it wil work, but it will fire the event on every element with that class
[07:43:59] <jerzi> it should appear to the user that the qtip shows 'instantly'
[07:44:10] <jerzi> as if it were a qtip fired on a click event
[07:44:20] <anli_> Is there anyone here that have tried to use chutzpah to unit test js code?
[07:44:25] <jerzi> I do realize ajax is asynchronous so it wouldn't be directly
[07:44:26] <anli_> Does it work well with jquery?
[07:45:15] <ney> how come this one doesn't then: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/5/ johnkpaul
[07:45:47] <johnkpaul> ney: because now you have explicit source order
[07:46:00] <ney> hmm, okay
[07:46:02] <johnkpaul> if you always have a .test8 _inside_ of the element that you add the click event to, that's fine
[07:46:08] <angelazou> johnkpaul: well, the decodeURIComponent didn't work either
[07:46:13] <angelazou> not sure why
[07:46:16] <johnkpaul> ney: but the example you orignally gave me didn't have that
[07:46:21] <johnkpaul> ?demo @angelazou
[07:46:21] <bot-t> angelazou, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:46:23] <jerzi> ney: look at the class names
[07:46:31] <ney> yeah, I see it
[07:46:42] <jerzi> ney:  the ones that don't work have a different class name than the ones that do work
[07:47:19] <ney> hmm okay
[07:47:25] <jerzi> you can have them both work by changing line 4 with: $(".test7 .test6").click(function()
[07:47:53] <jerzi> oh wrong
[07:48:01] <jerzi> nvm last advice
[07:48:06] <mspisars> tqrst: I can't find the documentation for it right now
[07:48:27] <ney> yeah, that didn't work, jerzi :)
[07:48:36] <tqrst> mspisars: I can't either, hence me being here :)
[07:48:42] <mspisars> but it definitely used to say that it would do a get if it was a cross domain request
[07:49:40] <tqrst> mspisars: closest I could find is a weirdly documented crossDomain option in $.ajax
[07:49:57] <jerzi> ney: this works http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/10/
[07:50:36] <jerzi> you need to have the same div (.test-8) inside the test-6 else it won't work
[07:50:48] <jerzi> your html structure needs to be in order
[07:51:11] <mspisars> tqrst: yeah not the same stuff I remember.
[07:51:39] <ney> okay, no way around doing that?
[07:52:03] <jerzi> you can have multiple buttons firing the same expand block
[07:52:13] <jerzi> but you'd better use an ID for that expand block then
[07:52:43] <tqrst> mspisars: according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414899/why-isnt-jquery-automatically-appending-the-jsonp-callback the docs used to say it
[07:52:46] <tqrst> but they don't any more
[07:52:50] <jerzi> johnkpaul: did you see my latest pastebin?
[07:52:55] <johnkpaul> no
[07:52:58] <johnkpaul> link?
[07:53:03] <ney> so in theory there's really no possible way to target a class if they arent in some way in the same div, jerzi?
[07:53:30] <jerzi> http://pastebin.com/m179xBqm
[07:54:15] <jerzi> ney: it is possbile, but then you should 'travel up the document tree' to find the right div to expand
[07:54:51] <jerzi> you see when a div 'A' is inside a div 'B', B is the child of A, A is its parent
[07:55:02] <ney> hmm okay. I think what I need is to travel up from one div and then down into another div
[07:55:08] <jerzi> if A has a div 'C' below it, C is a sibling of A
[07:55:19] <jerzi> going from B to C means indeed going 1 up and then find C
[07:55:55] <ney> isn't that what I need then? To go 1 up and then find C?
[07:56:02] <jerzi> yea I think so
[07:56:20] <jerzi> try it
[07:56:39] <jerzi> johnkpaul: does that look right according to the docs to you?
[07:58:27] <johnkpaul> jerzi: no you're not showing the qtip
[07:58:30] <johnkpaul> after the ajax call returns
[07:58:32] <johnkpaul> in the success method
[07:58:52] <jerzi> no but after the ajax call, so it still should fire right?
[07:59:04] <anli_> Wow, all qunit seems to product is "global error"
[07:59:10] <anli_> produce
[07:59:23] <ney> jerzi: is it clearer now what I need? http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/12/
[07:59:30] <johnkpaul> ah jerzi, I understand the issue
[07:59:33] <johnkpaul> ?ajax101 @jerzi
[07:59:33] <bot-t> jerzi, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:00:02] <rgr> Can someone recommend me a simple, mouse driven date and time picker other than jquery-ui one - it simply doesnot want to work in a modal dialog properly.
[08:01:36] <tqrst> mspisars: now that I think about it, I have control over the server side too, so I might just switch to websockets for this particular case instead
[08:01:50] <jerzi> ok I see that problem there
[08:02:07] <jerzi> but that's not my original problem
[08:02:17] <jerzi> I just moved it there
[08:03:28] <dux0r> I have an input with an id: <input type="button" name="goReplaceAll" value="Go" id="allReplace" style="cursor:hand;">
[08:03:30] <dux0r> and a call in my js:
[08:03:30] <ney> jerzi: is it clearer now what I need? http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/12/ sorry to bother you again >.<
[08:03:36] <dux0r>  $(document).ready(function() {
[08:03:41] <dux0r>   $('#allReplace').click(replaceAll);
[08:03:45] <dux0r>   });
[08:03:47] <johnkpaul> jerzi: if you move it all inside the success callback, that should work according to the docs
[08:03:57] <jerzi> yea tried that already
[08:03:59] <dux0r> but it refuses to do anything when I click the button, any ideas?
[08:04:34] <dux0r> No errors, just nothing happening
[08:05:34] <anli_> If I change the value of a <input type="text" using .val(), I have to use .change manually to call that handler, right?
[08:06:07] <NoiseEee> anli_: or just call the handler after you change the value programatically
[08:06:20] <mspisars> tqrst: but I am using this presently with 1.7
[08:06:22] <anli_> ok
[08:07:08] <omolio> Hi. I want to set nextUntil() for three target elements h3, h2 and h1. Is this possible? Something like nextUntil('h3 or h2 or h1')
[08:11:39] <alien_talk> anyone know good plugins to make an image circle?
[08:12:29] <alien_talk> er like a circle image cutout from a photograph?
[08:13:04] <alien_talk> nvm found it: http://webdesignerwall.com/demo/css3-image-styles/
[08:13:07] <ney> Can anyone help me out? I need to add a "target" to my code so it expands/collapses like the texts in the jsfiddle says, I'm not sure how to target it properly though. Heres the code: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/13/
[08:14:37] <dux0r> I have an input on my index page: <input type="button" name="goReplaceAll" value="Go" id="allReplaceGo" style="cursor:hand;" />
[08:14:37] <dux0r> And an onclick call from jquery: $(document).ready(function() {
[08:14:37] <dux0r> 		$('#allReplaceGo').click(replaceAll);
[08:14:37] <dux0r> });
[08:14:37] <dux0r> function replaceAll(){ alert('a'); }
[08:14:46] <dux0r> Any ideas why clicking does absolutely nothing?
[08:14:55] <dux0r> Link: http://www.texturepacker.net/
[08:15:33] <Asheck385> if($('input[value*="' + val + '"]').length>1) I need this to be case insensitive. Anyone have any ideas? Google fu isn't as helpful as I wish. Even a better search term hint would help me
[08:15:55] <Asheck385> figured typical ettiquette on these rooms is ask the question, don't ask to ask
[08:16:55] <ney> Can anyone help me out? I need to add a "target" to my code so it expands/collapses like the texts in the jsfiddle says, I'm not sure how to target it properly though. Heres the code: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/13/
[08:17:00] <BillCriswell> Asheck385: Totally.
[08:17:13] <Asheck385> totally?
[08:17:29] <BillCriswell> Asheck385: You have the etiquette right.
[08:17:55] <Asheck385> I see
[08:18:02] <Asheck385> and how do I private message someone
[08:18:11] <BillCriswell> Can you just lowercase the val as your'e comparing it?
[08:18:29] <BillCriswell> val.toLowerCase()
[08:18:29] <Asheck385> Tried that
[08:18:42] <Asheck385> theh problem is that the input values aren't all lowercase
[08:19:08] <Asheck385> tried to make a loop using each as well but that got headachy in a hurry
[08:19:09] <NoiseEee> right
[08:19:15] <Asheck385> because then I could use toLowerCase()
[08:19:44] <Asheck385> as you can probably tell, I'm far from an expert on jQuery
[08:19:46] <dux0r> compare against val.toLowerCase()
[08:20:07] <dux0r> then mixed case doesnt matter
[08:20:12] <Asheck385> if($('input[value="' + val.toLowerCase + '"]').length>1)
[08:20:23] <Asheck385> but there are elements on the page that have mixed case
[08:20:28] <Asheck385> and can be edited by the end users
[08:20:50] <Asheck385> hmm
[08:20:55] <ney> really no one who knows how to do this?: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/13/
[08:20:55] <Asheck385> maybe I'm not explaining it well
[08:21:06] <anli_> whats a good name of an operation that makes 3#4 of 3###4 ? not implode, but...
[08:21:17] <NoiseEee> Asheck385: you should probably dump the selector and grab the val() of each, in a loop
[08:21:22] <anli_> And not compact
[08:21:29] <NoiseEee> Asheck385: i don't think there's any way of declaring mixed case in an actual selector
[08:21:43] <mdelcx> anli_: regex replace :)
[08:21:53] <anli_> its an english word I am seeking for
[08:21:57] <anli_> the name of such an operation
[08:21:57] <Asheck385> yeah, NoiseEee. I suppose. Was trying to avoid that. It got messy because the elements weren't being found
[08:22:04] <BillCriswell> anli_: split()?
[08:22:12] <Asheck385> Simply put that piece is much more simple.
[08:22:16] <anli_> hm
[08:22:19] <Asheck385> I might just check on the insert into the DB
[08:22:22] <Asheck385> because that's case insensitive
[08:23:01] <at[o]m> hi
[08:23:04] <Asheck385> Welp...thanks guys, I was going to go the route you suggested without talking to you but was hoping you'd have a quick solution. I can't imagine that this is completely uncommon. Such is life. Thanks all for you help
[08:24:10] <NoiseEee> good luck Asheck385
[08:24:21] <BillCriswell> Asheck385: What your doing seems weird.
[08:26:52] <ney> really no one who knows how to do this?: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/13/
[08:28:43] <BillCriswell> anli_: '1####4###2#5'.replace(/#{2,}/g, '#')
[08:29:00] <poppiez> I'm doing this little fancy pancy check when using a specific feature on my site: if (!$.support.ajax || (!!window.ActiveXObject && !window.XMLHttpRequest)) {} it works great to avoid IE6 and other sucky browsers. although sucky, IE8 should be allowed but it isn't when our customers use IE8 inside citrix. any idea why?
[08:29:32] <BillCriswell> anli_: If you'd like to avoid regex you can use split() and filter perhaps?
[08:30:47] <BillCriswell> anli_: '3###2######4'.split('#').filter(function(item){ return item.length > 0 });
[08:31:29] <BillCriswell> anli_: Shit, sorry: '3###2######4'.split('#').filter(function(item){ return item.length > 0 }).join('#')
[08:34:11] <ney> trying again: anyone who can help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/13/ should explain itself
[08:36:58] <code_ph0y> hey guys hows it going ... can someone tell me how you fire an event?
[08:37:55] <BillCriswell> code_ph0y: Check out .trigger()
[08:38:17] <code_ph0y> thanks bud! much respect!
[08:38:40] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:38:55] <warden23> G'day, has anyone worked with jScrollPane before?
[08:38:58] <warden23> jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com
[08:38:59] <BillCriswell> ney: Can you make a more confusing example please?
[08:39:28] <dmcdaniel12> I'm using a jquery ajax call to get jsonp. I'm getting the error: SyntaxError: invalid label [Break On This Error] {"results". Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
[08:39:44] <warden23> Because atm the moment when I scroll on ipad the bar goes the opposite direction lol
[08:40:06] <ney> uhh, sorry. What should I make clearer? I need the div called "test6" to expand or collaps like the class called "test7" already does
[08:41:17] <dmcdaniel12> http://pastebin.com/RhTFNmLe - Here is my code so far
[08:41:44] <ney> is this better, BillCriswell ? http://jsfiddle.net/j54QD/15/
[08:41:55] <ryanneufeld> ney: your problem is that you're using $(this)
[08:42:01] <ryanneufeld> when you click on test6
[08:42:08] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't have any .text8 children
[08:42:22] <ryanneufeld> so it won't do anything
[08:42:26] <ney> yeah, I need to figure out how to target it correctly
[08:42:32] <ney> but that's what I dont know
[08:43:38] <ryanneufeld> well, your markup is working against you
[08:44:03] <ryanneufeld> you can use combinations of parent(), parents() and children() and find() I think
[08:44:06] <ney> I know, but I just thought there'd be a way
[08:44:06] <ryanneufeld> or use ID's
[08:44:25] <ryanneufeld> ney: there is a way, just not the one you'd like it seems
[08:44:26] <BillCriswell> You can use $(this).closest('.some-class').find('.test8')
[08:44:34] <ryanneufeld> BillCriswell++
[08:44:55] <BillCriswell> closest() would find the closest parent, to clarify.
[08:45:38] <ney> that worked!!!
[08:45:42] <ney> thanks a lot guys!
[08:45:47] <ney> thanks BillCriswell !!!
[08:45:51] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:46:09] <BillCriswell> ryanneufeld: Helped me a lot cause I had no idea what you were trying to explain haha
[08:46:43] <ryanneufeld> Yay everyone's happy
[08:46:45] <ney> I guess I should get better at explaining myself then. I've been at this problem for 5 hours straight now, so that might be it
[08:46:56] <ney> again: Thanks a lot :-)
[08:47:06] <ryanneufeld> to be fair, I don't know how I would have explained that better
[08:47:06] <BillCriswell> ney: I think it's your example that's confusing.
[08:47:30] <ryanneufeld> ney: BillCriswell is right, the example you gave was a little confusing, since you had the same thing duplicated.
[08:47:52] <ney> yeah, but that was the thing. It had to work duplicated as well
[08:48:05] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I hear you.
[08:48:08] <ney> I could only get it to work so it opened up in both sections at the same time
[08:48:18] <ryanneufeld> this is an example of where using .each is etter
[08:48:22] <dmcdaniel12> Anyone familiar with $.ajax and get/put?
[08:48:39] <shoky> nobody uses ajax
[08:48:49] <shoky> requests? to the server? whaaaat?
[08:48:50] <tw2113> i use it to clean my sinks
[08:49:05] <shoky> lul
[08:49:14] <xec> s/nobody/shoky
[08:49:35] <shoky> i c whut u did der
[08:49:35] <dmcdaniel12> I need to connect to a server and pull jsonp from it. I'm still new to jquery (just started learning about a few days ago) so I am a little lost with the error I am getting.
[08:49:40] <BillCriswell> I wonder if anli_ saw my response.
[08:49:48] <warden23> Anyone here have an ipad?
[08:49:55] <tw2113> well it's still debateable a bit if shoky is a "someone" anyway
[08:49:57] <tw2113> :)
[08:50:01] <shoky> ;]
[08:50:05] <BillCriswell> warden23: Not on me :(
[08:50:20] <xec> hehe
[08:50:24] <warden23> aww, does someone? http://www.toggleway.com.au/pre-release/weststyle/media/scoop.html
[08:50:28] <dmcdaniel12> I'm getting the error: SyntaxError: invalid label when I pull the info from the server. I know the get is working but not sure what I am doing wrong or if it is a server error with the info they are passing
[08:50:46] <warden23> on the big scroll bar to the right try and scroll up and down you'll notice it's reversed
[08:50:48] <warden23> to normal
[08:50:57] <BillCriswell> warden23: Have the meta viewport set up properly?
[08:51:07] <warden23> it's using this script: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[08:51:16] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: got a jsfiddle? or at least some code to show..
[08:51:37] <warden23> yeah, because even their official site
[08:51:39] <warden23> is reverse
[08:51:40] <warden23> lol
[08:51:51] <dmcdaniel12> shoky - http://pastebin.com/RhTFNmLe
[08:52:19] <BillCriswell> warden23: You're a brave man for messing with scrolling.
[08:52:39] <warden23> *flexes*
[08:52:46] <warden23> lol the client wants it, i dont like it
[08:52:54] <warden23> but hey they get what they want
[08:53:04] <dmcdaniel12> I get a different error based on browser. Chrome shows: Unexpected Token but Firefox shows the SyntaxError:
[08:53:21] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: what's the url?
[08:53:27] <shoky> you sure the server supports jsonp?
[08:53:41] <BillCriswell> warden23: You including the css before your js? http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/faqs.html
[08:54:07] <dmcdaniel12> shoky, the url is inside a vpn. I'm asking the developer now if it supports jsonp
[08:54:52] <freeed> Hey all.. I seem to remember a little known function of jQuery UI that allowed for fading out/in a class, e.g. removeClass().fadeOut().addClass() or similar.. any ideas?
[08:55:15] <BillCriswell> warden23: I feel like I'd be going at it with this client in a minute. I'm very lucky I don't do freelance work haha.
[08:55:35] <warden23> nah the css is before
[08:55:57] <warden23> lol
[08:56:17] <warden23> yeah i know.. im mean seriously who would want a scrollbar out in the middle of a page like that
[08:56:20] <warden23> it's like.. derp derp
[08:56:23] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: also, you wouldn't need to parseJSON the response, it should already be parsed if all goes well
[08:56:36] <dmcdaniel12> Got ya. Yeah, I changed that.
[08:56:58] <freeed> ahhh .toggleClass() nvm
[08:57:49] <dmcdaniel12> shoky - yeah, the server is setup to send it out as json
[08:58:08] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: json, sure. but does it support JSONP ?
[08:58:40] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: what do you see when you go to the url in your browser? or what does your browser's devtools network tab show for the response?
[08:58:55] <xckpd7> how do you do <not first and 2nd child)?
[08:59:04] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: and what's the actual url being fetched? doesnt matter if its in a vpn
[08:59:09] <dmcdaniel12> Here is the URL (obv you wont be able to get to it): http://172.19.0.70:8081/roads-services-backend/user/choozgroops/123456789/details
[08:59:22] <xckpd7> I tried this: td:not(:eq(1), :eq(0)) but that is only the first elements, not first child
[08:59:53] <xckpd7> I basically want this: td:not(:first-child, :second-child)
[09:00:06] <loincloth> hi all
[09:00:49] <loincloth> are there any plugins for making arbitrary elements layout to take up available height in a viewport?
[09:01:14] <loincloth> e.g. say there is some 'header' kind of content which just flows.. then there is a box which should dynamically adjust to fill the rest of the visible space
[09:02:46] <dmcdaniel12> shoky - Here is the URL (obv you wont be able to get to it): http://172.19.0.70:8081/roads-services-backend/user/choozgroops/123456789/details
[09:03:11] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: ok that's one of the questions partially answered.
[09:03:30] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: the important one was: does the server support JSONP yes no
[09:03:49] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: if the developer doesn't know, then it probably doesn't
[09:04:03] <dmcdaniel12> I'm not sure. Can't seem to get a straight answer. Keeps telling me it should be on client side only
[09:04:22] <dmcdaniel12> shoky - sorry, this is all new to me still.
[09:04:23] <iSeeDeadPixels> Wayfinder's OuterTpl gets only called once right?
[09:04:48] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: what do you get when you go to: http://172.19.0.70:8081/roads-services-backend/user/choozgroops/123456789/details?callback=abcd1234
[09:05:02] <warden23> \o/
[09:05:11] <dmcdaniel12> I get the results I need
[09:05:17] <shoky> dmcdaniel12: in what format, exactly ?
[09:05:25] <dmcdaniel12> let me get you a paste
[09:05:48] <dmcdaniel12> shoky - http://pastebin.com/DEA26iPN
[09:05:56] <shoky> yeah that's plain JSON
[09:06:15] <shoky> server doesn't support JSONP  (or you need a special callback name but i doubt it)
[09:07:21] <mckeder> shoky: sorry, I disconnected on accident
[09:07:26] <shoky> if it supported JSONP the respose would be something like:   abcd1234(JSON_STUFF_HERE);
[09:07:36] <mckeder> Ah okay
[09:07:49] <shoky> ??
[09:08:11] <shoky> oh you're him k
[09:08:15] <mckeder> sorry, it's dmcdaniel12. They wont let me use my other nick right now for some reason.
[09:08:18] <shoky> in case you didn't see:
[09:08:22] <shoky> [18:06:01] <shoky> yeah that's plain JSON
[09:08:22] <shoky> [18:06:20] <shoky> server doesn't support JSONP  (or you need a special callback name but i doubt it)
[09:08:28] <shoky> [18:07:31] <shoky> if it supported JSONP the respose would be something like:   abcd1234(JSON_STUFF_HERE);
[09:08:36] <mckeder> Okay, that makes sense.
[09:08:43] <mckeder> Thank you very much for your help.
[09:08:47] <shoky> np
[09:20:01] <xckpd7> question: how to do second-child in jQuery?
[09:20:21] <tw2113> nth-child(2)
[09:29:10] <NackNick> and someone take a quick look at my code, im getting a ie8 error on it saying "Object doesn't support this property or method" my code works fine on everything else =/ http://pastebin.com/qNrFrZCn
[09:29:38] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: You could even do :eq(1) or .eq(1).
[09:30:25] <BillCriswell> give the line number?
[09:30:51] <NackNick> line 1
[09:30:54] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: the problem is, is that first-child isn't just the first result
[09:31:01] <NackNick> the very 1st dang line -_-
[09:31:18] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: if I say td.first-child, I'm saying give me all the td's which are first-childs inside of their trs
[09:31:28] <BillCriswell> NackNick: Should you be doing function($) ?
[09:31:54] <NackNick> well i tried that but still same result
[09:32:02] <NackNick> its the $ thats throwing the error
[09:32:09] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: eq is just saying "give me the first element that this selector pulls"
[09:32:17] <NackNick> i have $('#button').click(function($) {
[09:32:23] <BillCriswell> NackNick: Change it to just "e" or "event" maybe?
[09:32:43] <BillCriswell> not strings, obviously.
[09:32:54] <jedimind> can anyone recommend a decent looking corner curl plugin thats cross browser
[09:33:04] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: You $('.foo')[0] maybe?
[09:33:05] <NackNick> so e('#button').click(function() {
[09:33:06] <NackNick> ?
[09:33:11] <bartmax> ? data
[09:33:11] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:33:25] <BillCriswell> NackNick: No no, jusst $('#button').click(function(){
[09:33:56] <bartmax> is there any shorthand use of data to filter by data without doing .find('element[data-attr="someVal"]') ?
[09:34:05] <NackNick> i oringinally had that and then i added the $ inside the function and still the error occured
[09:34:38] <BillCriswell> Why are you passing the $? $ is becoming an event variable in the funct... I think? Maybe I don't know enough about this.
[09:35:29] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: I think that's what you want.
[09:35:50] <bartmax> NackNick: remove the $ from the .click(function(<< NO $ HERE >>)
[09:36:03] <BillCriswell> $('b')[0] on <b>boobies</b> and <b>beer</b> would return boobies.
[09:36:11] <NackNick> i changed it to jQuery
[09:36:15] <NackNick> seems to work now...
[09:36:17] <BillCriswell> NackNick: No no no.
[09:36:24] <NackNick> why why why?
[09:36:25] <BillCriswell> Just don't pass anythign there.
[09:36:38] <BillCriswell> function() will do just fine.
[09:36:47] <NackNick> if i put $('#button').click(function() {
[09:36:51] <BillCriswell> Not even sure how it's working the way you have it in other browsers.
[09:36:55] <NackNick> the error still occurs
[09:37:17] <NackNick> if i change it to jQuery('#button').click(function($) {
[09:37:21] <NackNick> sorry
[09:37:23] <bartmax> NackNick: when you put the $ there, inside the function scope $ will became the event click, so if you try to use $ (jQuery) you are actually saying : $ = clickevent, so you lost access to $. It's like an override.
[09:37:28] <NackNick> jQuery('#button').click(function() {
[09:37:33] <NackNick> problem solved
[09:38:03] <NackNick> ok but either make the script not work in ie
[09:38:14] <bartmax> NackNick: problem is, you are redefining $ somewhere else (with the same mechanism described above) .. so review your code or pastebin somewhere and remove the $ in the function ( ) param scope.
[09:38:14] <BillCriswell> NackNick: Is $ something else in your code and not jQuery?
[09:38:21] <BillCriswell> Nevermind. I'm grabbing a beer.
[09:38:25] <BillCriswell> I'll be back.
[09:38:34] <bartmax> NackNick: try to read with attention.
[09:38:49] <bartmax> NackNick: what you are doing will give you headache.
[09:39:19] <BillCriswell> NackNick: What bartmax is saying.
[09:39:47] <aca20031> http://pastebin.com/FUmgn2bT So im sure im doing something wrong, but given this, my function slider_activate(data) { console.log(data.index); } prints "undefined" - cant find an example of passing data to event functions either!
[09:40:48] <bartmax> aca20031: what's container? what's sliders? where is jquery in that code ?
[09:41:10] <aca20031> well the where is jquery question is silly considering the .mouseover, but for the rest
[09:41:16] <aca20031> http://st0rm.net/demo.php all the code is here
[09:41:24] <aca20031> very simple demo of just this one concern
[09:41:35] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I have a quick question. So I'm trying to use jQuery to make an ajax request for a stand alone HTML file. Here is the file: http://pastebin.com/mZvCz8Xd
[09:41:36] <jjb123> Whenever I run this, firebug says that the request was okay with a 200 response code, however the response text is empty and jQuery says the request failed. When I access the url (from the firebug XHR panel) in my browser, it returns valid JSON. Any ideas?
[09:41:56] <jjb123> Also, I thought it might be because of the same-origin thing but I thought .get was supposed to take care of that?
[09:42:37] <bartmax> aca20031: silly is how you are writing your code :) not the question.
[09:42:50] <NackNick> ...
[09:43:02] <bartmax> how can someone will imaging that .label is actually a $('<img/>') <-- and there is the jQuery
[09:43:07] <aca20031> if you have a suggestion give it
[09:43:09] <aca20031> dont just throw about insults
[09:43:31] <bartmax> aca20031: im explaining why the question wasn't silly as you pointed out first
[09:43:45] <bartmax> ? mouseover
[09:43:45] <bot-t> .mouseover(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mouseover" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[09:43:45] <NackNick> go to
[09:43:47] <NackNick> https://online-medicare-plans.com/form/
[09:43:58] <NackNick> you will see its the only error on the whole site
[09:44:09] <aca20031> ive read it, as best as i can see there are no examples there about passing data to the callback function
[09:45:17] <NackNick> i understand what you guys are saying, but jQuery might have to be used in this case
[09:46:25] <jjb123> Also, the thrownError parameter from jQuery is empty
[09:47:02] <codeshah> hey guys, question about google maps js api... on the first load of the page, it is always a bit down and to the right instead of centered. Then it's always OK... [Is this right place to ask or another channel?]
[09:48:14] <bartmax> codeshah: make sure your set the height / width before loading the map
[09:49:06] <bartmax> NackNick: you are loading 2 versions of jQuery on that page
[09:49:20] <bartmax> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.0.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> and <script type='text/javascript' src='https://online-medicare-plans.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.7.2'></script>
[09:52:24] <bartmax> NackNick: apart from that, i dont see a problem in the code.
[09:53:02] <bartmax> NackNick: except i recommend doing <label for="id"> for your gender options in the form :)
[09:53:38] <NackNick> =) ok
[09:53:55] <bartmax> NackNick: you are using the tag label on elements that shouldn't be labels.
[09:54:54] <bartmax> NackNick: and label have a great functionality when u use it like <label for="someInputId">text</label><input id="someInputId />
[10:13:23] <MichMich> Hey guys...
[10:14:03] <MichMich> I'm looking for some nice Javascript libraries for http://devcandy.net - Suggestions anybody?
[10:17:21] <ninjanlu> Hello guys
[10:18:13] <ninjanlu> I have a proposal for the jquery plugin website
[10:19:13] <ninjanlu> is there someone interested?
[10:21:42] <dux0r> Any info appreciated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12644563/jquery-onclick-placer-doing-nothing
[10:23:27] <johnkpaul> dux0r: what browser?
[10:23:33] <johnkpaul> dux0r: http://jsfiddle.net/kasqm/ works for me on chrome 22
[10:23:35] <FiLeVeR10> dux0r: you have to define it before you call it, put the function above the click
[10:23:58] <dux0r> Testing on chrome
[10:24:11] <dux0r> isn't document.ready declared after the dom loads?
[10:24:20] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: that isn't true, a function declaration will be hoisted
[10:24:45] <FiLeVeR10> johnkpaul: it can be, but it isn't here
[10:24:57] <johnkpaul> dux0r: functions that you pass to $(document).ready() will be executed when the dom is ready
[10:24:58] <dux0r> Hmm, on Firefox it alerts without me clicking
[10:24:59] <ag4ve> what's the method to insert text inside tags - before the end of the tag?
[10:25:04] <dux0r> i.e when I load the page
[10:25:05] <dux0r> weird
[10:25:09] <dux0r> I see
[10:25:11] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: http://jsfiddle.net/kasqm/
[10:25:19] <johnkpaul> it is hoisted in dux0r's example
[10:25:28] <ag4ve> so i've got <dif id="info">INFO:</div> how do i insert after INFO:?
[10:26:30] <ag4ve> .append would be after </div> .insertAfter seems to do about the same (opposite) ...?
[10:27:07] <FiLeVeR10> johnkpaul: then he wouldn't get a not defined error.
[10:27:23] <mspisars> .append() should be the right thing not after </div>
[10:27:25] <dux0r> Yeah, moving the function above makes no difference
[10:27:27] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: you mean when it's in the onclick attribute?
[10:27:42] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: that depends on what scope the code in the example on stack overflow is in
[10:27:48] <FiLeVeR10> no, just the js
[10:27:55] <ninjanlu> www.gianlucaguarini.com/blog/jquery-plugins-website-redesign-proposal/
[10:28:02] <FiLeVeR10> johnkpaul: indeed it does
[10:28:14] <ninjanlu> just in case you would check my redesign prototype
[10:28:17] <johnkpaul> the function declaration will always be hoisted
[10:28:23] <johnkpaul> just how javascript works
[10:28:23] <FiLeVeR10> no point in onclick if you're doin it w/jquery though...
[10:28:24] <ninjanlu> i am already developing it
[10:28:38] <dux0r> I'm not using onclick
[10:28:41] <dux0r> I was before
[10:28:46] <dux0r> I'm using .click
[10:29:02] <dux0r> onclick actually worked though
[10:29:06] <dux0r> or launched the function
[10:29:41] <ag4ve> iirc, click is depreciated
[10:30:02] <dux0r> tried .live too
[10:30:03] <dux0r> also fails
[10:30:22] <dux0r> Screw it, I'll wait for a stack overflow reply
[10:31:21] <ninjanlu> any feedback?
[10:32:27] <FiLeVeR10> johnkpaul: not in all browsers, not all the time... http://statichtml.com/2011/spidermonkey-function-hoisting.html
[10:32:56] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: sure, tehre are bugs around conditionals, but not in that example
[10:33:39] <johnkpaul> FiLeVeR10: http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
[10:33:48] <johnkpaul> that has every single detail
[10:33:53] <johnkpaul> very interesting read
[10:35:06] <FiLeVeR10> johnkpaul: yea, that one should be fine. there must be more to it if it's not working
[10:42:42] <ag4ve> err, how do i select a div class within a div class? <div class="one"> .... <div class="two"> here </div></div> ?
[10:43:23] <BillCriswell> ag4ve: $('.one').find('.two')
[10:43:32] <BillCriswell> or just $('.one .two')
[10:43:55] <ag4ve> oh, thanks
[10:44:15] <ag4ve> i getting farther and farther off there :(
[10:44:35] <BillCriswell> Keep at it.
[10:44:52] <BillCriswell> ag4ve: Do you know CSS?
[10:50:39] <ag4ve> BillCriswell: i've dealt with xpath a little, but not much.
[10:53:56] <BillCriswell> ag4ve: Hmmm... jQuery use to have xpath support.
[10:54:00] <BillCriswell> Not sure if it still does.
[10:54:39] <BillCriswell> Learning a bit of CSS will help you a lot though!
[10:59:27] <dux0r> Which of these would be quickest for checking if an image exists in jS? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3646914/how-do-i-check-if-file-exists-in-jquery-or-javascript
[11:08:28] <astropirate> dux0r, the proper way to do it is make a request with HEAD method.... if your file server supports HEAD method. if it doesnt then just make a regular request
[11:08:34] <astropirate> it doesnt really matter which way yo udo it

[11:13:03] <aca20031>  sliders[i].label.mouseover({index:i},slider_activate);  sliders[i] is an $('<img>') - my only problem with this is that slider_activate(data) { console.log(data.index); } prints undefined - how can I pass "i" to it if this is not the method to do so?
[11:18:31] <macclearich_> anyone know why, when I call $.ajax(url, {type: 'post', … options …} ) it doesn't respect any of the parameters to the function and just makes a GET request to the url of the current page?
[11:18:40] <macclearich_> I'm completely flabbergasted.
[11:19:39] <macclearich_> I was able to get it to do *some* of the right things by forcing $.ajaxSetup() just before issuing the $.ajax(), but it still didn't pick up my data parameter
[11:21:09] <macclearich_> 866 people here and nobody's got anything?
[11:22:56] <mdelcx> macclearich_: can you put up a demo? people would be more likely to help...
[11:23:18] <macclearich_> it's difficult, this is a huge page
[11:23:22] <mdelcx> also, unless you paid for jQuery support, you can wait a few minutes for an answer...
[11:23:44] <macclearich_> i'll wait as long as it takes, man

[11:50:02] <Gates> Anyone up for a navgation menu challenge?
[11:50:10] <Gates> Im pretty confident it cane be done in all css

[11:55:01] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with bxSlider jquery plugin?  i'm having issues with miscalculated width in chrome
[11:58:54] <xec> Gates: i'm not sure what you think javascript can do for you in this case
[11:59:31] <xec> Gates: you've got the behaviour already, all that's lacking is the appearance, which is css
[11:59:44] <Gates> xec: duplicate the object
[11:59:55] <Gates> xec: any ideas on how to do it
[12:00:05] <xec> duplicate what?
[12:01:08] <arielserafini> Gates, that's probably the best fiddle I've seen
[12:01:12] <arielserafini> congratulations :P
[12:01:57] <termite> yes you get a cookie
[12:01:58] <xec> arielserafini: you just hit a 7/10 on my sarcasm-o-meter
[12:02:11] <arielserafini> that was not sarcasm
[12:02:12] <arielserafini> :/
[12:02:23] <arielserafini> it is really a well explained fiddle
[12:02:25] <xec> it must not be working
[12:02:26] <arielserafini> is it not?
[12:02:52] <termite> Gates: did someone answer your question because you can do it in jquery
[12:02:54] <xec> hehe sorry it's just a lot of weird class names in the markup
[12:03:24] <arielserafini> Gates, what exactly are you trying to do?

[12:06:32] <CodesStuff> I figured it out
[12:06:42] <CodesStuff> I'm an idiot and had JS disabled on Chrome for some reason.
[12:06:49] <Brodingo> ?cc
[12:06:50] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[12:06:52] <CodesStuff> LOL
[12:06:56] <termite> ahah
[12:07:02] * CodesStuff puts on sunglasses
[12:07:07] <xec> the "i never ask them in here" sort of threw me :P
[12:07:28] <CodesStuff> I seriously spend more time answering questions in here
[12:07:32] <CodesStuff> than anything else
[12:07:57] <CodesStuff> God I'm dumb lol. I can't stop laughing at my idiocy
[12:08:11] * xec makes CodesStuff a cup of coffee
[12:08:44] * CodesStuff greedily sips his blueberry cobbler coffee he got 30 minutes ago
[12:09:56] <xec> Gates: as far as i can tell, you can achieve what you want with css alone. some border-radius and rgba magic for transparency
[12:10:36] <Gates> termite: no they didnt
[12:10:38] <Gates> arielserafini: why
[12:11:02] <Gates> xec: i cant because the hover box is bigger than the height
[12:11:25] <xec> Gates: the height of what? sorry i'm not following
[12:11:51] <arielserafini> Gates, http://jsfiddle.net/aWrur/13/
[12:12:21] <Gates> arielserafini: def a step forward
[12:12:26] <Gates> but theres one issue that i have
[12:12:50] <Gates> xec: this is for you too
[12:13:13] <Gates> the height of the rounded box for example when u hover "Products" on arielserafini fiddle
[12:13:29] <Gates> its TALLER than the line to the right and left
[12:13:33] <Gates> thus my issue
[12:13:36] <arielserafini> ah
[12:13:40] <arielserafini> that specific?
[12:13:47] <arielserafini> why do you have to match that EXACTLY?
[12:13:55] <xec> that's because of the size
[12:14:08] <xec> :P
[12:14:41] <xec> what if you insert a "|" between, instead of making borders
[12:15:22] <xec> #menu-primary-menu > li + li:before { content: "|"; }
[12:15:25] <arielserafini> Gates, exaggerated example http://jsfiddle.net/aWrur/14/
[12:16:12] <Gates> arielserafini: how the f*
[12:16:33] <arielserafini> Gates, ?
[12:16:48] <Gates> it looks to be correct
[12:16:51] <arielserafini> ah
[12:16:57] <arielserafini> negative margin
[12:16:59] <Gates> xec: idk maybe
[12:17:03] <arielserafini> with the same amount of positive padding
[12:17:06] <Gates> arielserafini: is that cross browser?
[12:17:11] <arielserafini> you tell me
[12:17:15] <arielserafini> i'm not testing that
[12:17:32] <arielserafini> but that should be a starting point for you
[12:17:33] <arielserafini> hopefully
[12:17:39] <xec> nothing wrong with negative margins
[12:17:42] <arielserafini> yeah
[12:17:52] <arielserafini> it * should* work, but I didn't test
[12:17:58] <Gates> arielserafini: what as it the best fiddle
[12:18:15] <Gates> arielserafini and xec - thanks alot!!
[12:18:20] <xec> but as it is now, it applies to descendant list elements too
[12:18:29] <arielserafini> Gates, ah, that's because you added your code neatly and provided an example and all
[12:19:00] <Gates> xec: but i can just set the margin on the chrilden
[12:19:13] <xec> Gates: yep
[12:20:19] <xec> the shadow is going to be tricky though
[12:20:31] <xec> as its two boxes
[12:20:48] <Gates> xec: yeah fml
[12:21:09] <xec> does it need to be transparent?
[12:21:58] <xec> if not, you can probably fix it with a third box on top of the part of the shadow you don't want
[12:22:25] <xec> but this is all better discussed in #css really
[12:26:43] <Gates> agreed
[12:26:50] <Gates> i was there but not a lot of help
[12:26:53] <Gates> thanks everyone (:
[12:31:45] <MXBrandon> I have an object and multiple properties defined in that object.  In the object, I have a method which calls jquery $.ajax().  Within the success:function(), I try to access my objects properties, however 'this' now refers to to success:function.  Is there a way to access my objects properties without needing to pass it into the success:function()?
[12:33:42] <vacho> 	$("#dialog").load("dialog.ajax.php",{"type": type, asset_status_id: asset_status_id  } ).dialog("open"); 		$("#radio").buttonset();
[12:33:53] <vacho> can someone check that out? my buttonset is not being set... :(
[12:33:59] <vacho> is it because the content is loaded with ajax?
[12:35:43] <vacho> ajpiano: :D
[12:37:10] <Pymous> Hello !
[12:37:51] <Pymous> I have a small issue with my code, here the JSFiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/66/
[12:38:24] <Pymous> I'm trying to create a pagination, but when I try to change the actual page with the function setPage, the addClass and removeClass aren't working :(
[12:42:00] <vacho> dfq!
[12:43:28] <llu> is jquery.dataTables-1.9.4.min.js compatible with jquery 1.7.2?
[12:46:51] <latour2012> How can i force this: $('input[name=splits]:checked').val() into an integer even though it's undefined?
[12:48:13] <BillCriswell> latour2012: You mean you want 0?
[12:48:25] <MXBrandon> I have an object and multiple properties defined in that object.  In the object, I have a method which calls jquery $.ajax().  Within the success:function(), I try to access my objects properties, however 'this' now refers to to success:function.  Is there a way to access my objects properties without needing to pass it into the success:function()?
[12:49:02] <latour2012> BillCriswell, Yeah
[12:49:13] <latour2012> BillCriswell, if the user does't fill out the value it's undefined and it breaks the script
[12:49:21] <filipiz> MXBrandon: see the attribute "context " on the ajax options documentation...
[12:49:42] <BillCriswell> latour2012: $('input[name=splits]:checked').val() || 0
[12:49:54] <filipiz> you can set your object as the context of the ajax call and make "this" as your object
[12:50:13] <latour2012> wow, thanks Bill!
[12:50:28] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:50:39] <jholloman> you'll still want to do parseint right?
[12:50:44] <jholloman> .val of an input will return string?
[12:50:55] <Pymous> I need some help, I have a simple Class toggle function, but the CSS doesn't change according to the new class, even if the event is fired : http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/66/
[12:51:07] <BillCriswell> latour2012: He brings up a good point, depend on the script.
[12:51:09] <jholloman> parseInt( #(selector).val(), 10 ) || 0
[12:51:12] <MXBrandon> filipiz> Thanks, checking it now
[12:51:21] <jholloman> depends if you really need an int for math or not i suppose
[12:51:48] <BillCriswell> running parseInt on undefined may break things though?
[12:52:01] <jholloman> doing that || 0 was giving me 0 in console
[12:52:06] <jholloman> not sure if that's just for chrome though
[12:52:08] <jholloman> may be unsafe
[12:52:34] <jholloman> parseInt(undefined, 10) gives NaN
[12:52:52] <FiLeVeR10> so if it = Nan define it
[12:52:59] <jholloman> so NaN || 0 then you get 0
[12:53:05] <FiLeVeR10> indeed
[12:53:26] <BillCriswell> Truth.
[12:53:38] <BillCriswell> Wasn't sure how NaN woudl be handled
[12:54:00] <danheberden> add a little hummus and you got yourself a great snack
[12:54:24] <jholloman> hummus + NaN === true?
[12:54:28] <BillCriswell> typeof $this.val() === 'undefined' ? parseInt( $this.val(), 10 ) : 0; was my next guess haha
[12:54:48] <BillCriswell> parseInt( $this.val(), 10 ) || 0 definite works though
[12:57:54] <Pymous> Nobody for my CSS not being changed ? :(
[12:57:54] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/67/
[12:58:24] <user_> is this the right channel to ask QUnit questions in, or is there a QUnit channel?
[12:58:33] <BillCriswell> Pymous: You should close <ul>.
[12:58:48] <jholloman> @pymous: i can't get jsfiddle to load for some reason
[12:59:05] <Pymous> BillCriswell > Updated (but not the reason ;) ) => http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/68/
[12:59:14] <jholloman> hmm no #qunit room, can try here or stackoverflow if no luck here
[12:59:15] <Pymous> jholloman > Ohhh :( wan't something else ?
[12:59:36] <jholloman> i think my network is having issues, been flakey lately
[12:59:55] <jholloman> ah it loaded
[12:59:58] <jholloman> what was the issue again?
[13:00:24] <BillCriswell> Pymous: Is it just supposed to be highlighting the one you click and none of the others?
[13:00:24] <Pymous> jholloman > Try to click on a Grey square
[13:00:25] <sphinxxx> i need a content slider.. i've been using bxSlider but it has a serious bug with chrome and i have to find something else
[13:00:33] <Pymous> It should change to blue, but it doesn't
[13:00:53] <Pymous> BillCriswell > The one clicked should become blue, and all the others be grey
[13:01:21] <Pymous> the class is actually removed (and the added to the new), but the CSS, for some reason, isn't updated
[13:01:24] <jholloman> ok thats what i thought
[13:03:25] <Pymous> I seriously don't understand why it's doing this, it's nothing much :(
[13:03:27] <Pymous> Any clue ?
[13:05:13] <BillCriswell> Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/bnQjQ/ might help? Hacked that up quick for you.
[13:06:03] <BillCriswell> Ohhh, I see.
[13:06:32] <jholloman> you're adding/removing the class from the li
[13:06:35] <jholloman> but it starts in the a
[13:06:40] <jholloman> that's one issue I see
[13:08:01] <ninjanlu> hello guys
[13:08:15] <BillCriswell> Pymous: Why is the pagination being refreshed every time?
[13:08:26] <jholloman> @Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/70/
[13:08:38] <jholloman> I updated so it's looking at the anchor tags instead of the li tags
[13:08:41] <Pymous> jholloman > That was it !
[13:08:44] <Pymous> I'm so stupid ><
[13:08:54] <jholloman> can still probably make the selectors a little smaller
[13:09:02] <jholloman> might not need the ul
[13:09:09] <jholloman> depends on what else you have on the page though
[13:09:46] <Pymous> jholloman > Thanks you for your help (.subs-pagination li a is the smalles avalaible for my markup :) )
[13:09:54] <Pymous> BillCriswell > Thanks for trying, really :)
[13:09:58] <ninjanlu> is there someone agree with me that jquery plugin website needs a restyle?
[13:10:07] <BillCriswell> Haha no problem!
[13:11:18] <BillCriswell> ninjanlu: I think it was accidentally deleted and they're working on it.
[13:11:34] <ninjanlu> i made a redesign prototype
[13:11:41] <ninjanlu> and i am working on it
[13:11:55] <FiLeVeR10> http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/bnQjQ/5/
[13:12:02] <ninjanlu> http://www.gianlucaguarini.com/blog/jquery-plugins-website-redesign-proposal/
[13:12:03] <BillCriswell> Party time.
[13:12:26] <BillCriswell> FiLeVeR10: No love for end?!
[13:12:26] <BillCriswell> end()*
[13:12:39] <FiLeVeR10> ?
[13:12:59] <BillCriswell> FiLeVeR10: You took the code I had and removed the end() usage haha
[13:13:09] <ninjanlu> @BillCriswell do you think that this could be a good draft?
[13:13:32] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: didn't see the end on the one i went to
[13:13:54] <BillCriswell> It's commented out on your link thingie.
[13:14:10] <BillCriswell> ninjanlu: Looks nice, very metroish.
[13:14:16] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: id it necessary?
[13:14:19] <FiLeVeR10> *is
[13:14:35] <BillCriswell> It was just a preference haha
[13:14:54] <BillCriswell> It's basically the same code.
[13:15:15] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: well the one you had went through all siblings to look for active, this one only looks for active and not all siblings
[13:16:10] <ninjanlu> 	@BillCriswell thanks but I mean.. is there any chance that they could consider my prototype?
[13:16:28] <BillCriswell> FiLeVeR10: Still would be $(this).siblings('.active').removeClass('active').end().addClass('active'); instead using end.. wonder which is faster.
[13:16:32] <BillCriswell> ninjanlu: I have zero idea.
[13:16:57] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: fixed http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/bnQjQ/6/
[13:17:02] <ninjanlu> someone said that the new one will be released in a couple of weeks
[13:17:18] <BillCriswell> FiLeVeR10: Word.
[13:17:59] <BillCriswell> I wonder how much of a speed difference siblings() vs siblings('.foo') is
[13:18:08] <BillCriswell> not enough to care ever, still curious.
[13:20:35] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: well with just siblings it will look for all, where as with siblings('.foo') it only look for elemtns on the same level with that class. so i would imagine in instances where you have a lot of elements to go through it could make a bit of a difference. though for a item list probably not so much
[13:27:07] <FiLeVeR10> BillCriswell: this one will work in more places http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/bnQjQ/17/
[13:27:46] <BillCriswell> Not sure what you mean by more places?
[13:28:11] <FiLeVeR10> fixed the issues in safari and ie6
[13:28:21] <FiLeVeR10> css
[13:29:01] <MXBrandon> filipiz: This is a bit of a delayed response since I was reading the document you sent me, but ajax context worked perfect. Thanks!
[13:32:49] <filipiz> MXBrandon: ;)
[13:35:46] <TelFiRE> Hey, anyone know why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/tb4Wm/
[13:35:58] <TelFiRE> Trying to get the height of an element then set the height of a different element to that.
[13:36:46] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: .css('height', slideheight); maybe/
[13:37:15] <TelFiRE> Actually now that I think about it... the way this old, hacky slideshow works... I don't think it's actually got an image on the page on document ready... so that explains it
[13:37:49] <TelFiRE> oh nope nvm that wasnt it you were totally right BillCriswell :) thanks
[13:38:06] <BillCriswell> Sweeet.
[13:38:10] <Brodingo> yeah height isnt a setter
[13:38:45] <FiLeVeR10> don't u need to add 'px'?
[13:38:46] <FiLeVeR10> http://jsfiddle.net/filever10/tb4Wm/2/
[13:38:53] <Brodingo> no
[13:39:17] <BillCriswell> Don't think it hurts to add the 'px'.
[13:39:30] <FiLeVeR10> the height value is just an int
[13:43:47] <Brodingo> oh, height _is_ a setter
[13:43:50] <Brodingo> mybad
[13:44:18] <simple__> is some function is define as such :   this.$element.bind('orbit.goto', function (event, index) {      how do i call it in my own javascript?
[13:44:59] <Brodingo> ew what
[13:45:36] <jholloman> have a good weekend all
[13:46:45] <Brodingo> simple__ paste an example of the code to get some better help
[13:47:39] <simple__> Brodingo:  I'm using https://github.com/zurb/orbit
[13:48:09] <simple__> just need to know the code to goto slide..  im trying $('#featured-slides').orbits.goto(5); which doesn't work
[13:48:51] <Brodingo> hmmm ok well never used that but typically one would use trigger() for custom events
[13:49:30] <simple__> example?
[13:49:43] <Brodingo> other than that maybe consult the documentation for usage
[13:49:50] <Brodingo> ?trigger
[13:49:51] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[13:50:37] <simple__> documentation is very limited
[13:51:21] <Brodingo> yeah i see that
[13:51:35] <Brodingo> you should bug them if they want adopters ;)
[13:52:30] <simple__> bingo that was the key i was missing, thanks Brodingo
[13:52:43] <Brodingo> great, cheers
[14:07:37] <rogi> how do I select based on data- attribute on elements?
[14:08:11] <rogi> $('a:data(foo=bar)') … but without that plugin?
[14:11:42] <rogi> anyone?
[14:13:04] <madprops> can I define the argument in js, like somefunc(a=x, b=y) ?
[14:13:31] <madprops> can I have default values for this arguments?
[14:15:32] <rogi> madprops: nope, you can pass an object and 'extend' it with defaults
[14:15:56] <rogi> madprops: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[14:16:21] <rogi> or rather, extend your defaults with the passed in objects
[14:16:32] <rogi> object
[14:16:52] <xec> you could also just set each argument var
[14:16:53] <Jon47> its kinda messy but you could do:     a = a || 'x'; b = b || 'y';    on the first few lines
[14:18:38] <rogi> Jon47: avoid that due to falsy args
[14:28:18] <rogi> is jquery.cookies available from any CDN out there?
[14:30:08] <simple__> I define it like this in one block of <script>jQuery(function($) {    function changeSlide(index) {}}    then in another block i call it <script>jQuery(function($) { changeSlide(4);      then function not found....  what am i doing wrong????
[14:31:07] <danheberden> simple__: changeSlide is scoped what it's in
[14:31:11] <danheberden> and you have it in a closure
[14:31:29] <danheberden> (the anonymous function that is inside of function($){}
[14:31:32] <danheberden> ugh
[14:31:36] <danheberden> inside of jQuery()
[14:32:22] <simple__> oh, its nested becuase of that?
[14:32:28] <danheberden> What *i* would do is make something global - `var slide = { changeSlide: function(index){} }` along with any other properties or methods
[14:32:45] <danheberden> that way, you can reference slide.changeSlide (or some better naming convention) elsewhere
[14:33:40] <danheberden> another note, if you *do* need to attach something to be global (remember, though, globals are the devil) you can explicitly do that with `window.whatever = yourShit`
[14:33:51] <danheberden> because `window` is the global object
[14:33:55] <danheberden> in this case
[14:34:31] <danheberden> also jQuery( function($){} ); is gross and confusing - i recommend being verbose about it: `jQuery( document ).ready( function($) {`
[14:34:59] <simple__> hmm im working in the drupal envornment.  they recommened using Drupal.behavior.myCustom = { attach: function}}   but i don't understand that one either
[14:35:32] <danheberden> I'm not familiar with Drupal at all, but I would imagine 'Drupal' is a global
[14:37:19] <rogi> nothing wrong with $(function(){});
[14:38:14] <rogi> RE: my plugin CDN question, http://www.jsdelivr.com/ has it, supports https too
[14:50:06] <johnline>  that pump cuz
[14:53:21] <devslash> I'm using a jQuery plugin called jQueryFiletree that lets me browse a path on my server using a windows explorer like way. each line for a directory is based on a list item and each row is built with this html code: <li class="directory collapsed"><a href="#" rel="/var/www/test/Music/some album/">some album</a></li>. if i use firebug to modify the link text, the link stops working
[14:53:44] <aniasis> Hey guys.  Any know issue with sending a http request using jQuery 1.4.2 in IE?
[14:53:46] <devslash> .j html
[14:53:49] <devslash> oops
[14:54:20] <aniasis> Sending a nested http request that is.
[14:57:42] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[15:27:55] <simple__> i still dont get it.  after Drupal.behaviors.exampleModule = { attach: function {}}  How do it get the link onClick="exampleModule();"    to fire the function?
[15:59:04] <Navetz> hey guys, not sure if i'm asking in the right place but I'm trying to implement an idea for the frontpage of a website. I'd like to know if there are any tips/tools/plugins you guys could give me for something like this: http://i.imgur.com/Gw0h1.png
[16:10:42] <ag4ve> how do i .toggle with mouseover / mouseoff ?
[16:11:32] <bung> say i have var $obj1 = $('#obj1'); and i want to do $('#obj1.active').bind(...) ... is there a way to do it with the $obj1 var?
[16:11:38] <ag4ve> ... i guess i need to look for some menu examples
[16:11:49] <bung> ag4ve: .toggle(function(){}, function(){});
[16:11:59] <bung> sorry hover() not toggle()
[16:12:03] <bung> ? hover @ ag4ve
[16:12:04] <bot-t> ag4ve, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[16:13:22] <blindMoe> can anyone recommend a good form validation plugin?  ( there are so many I figured I would ask to see what people actually use )
[16:13:36] <ag4ve> bot-t: thanks, that got me what i think i want: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2262480/jquery-live-hover
[16:13:36] * bot-t sighs
[16:13:44] <bung> lol
[16:13:57] <blindMoe> hehe
[16:14:07] <ag4ve> blindMoe: validate.js maybe?
[16:14:20] <bung> blindMoe: ive used the bassistance one
[16:14:41] <blindMoe> ag4ve: validate.js is not jquery dependant is it?
[16:14:52] <savid> Hi, I'd like to animate something to the left while fading out, but I can't figure out how to do that with animate().  Any ideas?
[16:15:07] <ag4ve> blindMoe: nope. i know it from node stuff
[16:15:10] <blindMoe> savid: have it animate both opacity and left at the same time
[16:15:18] <blindMoe> ag4ve: k cool.. just wanted to make sure I was looking at the right one
[16:15:36] <bung> blindMoe: savid, .fadeOut().animate(...)
[16:15:43] <savid> Ah, good idea.  Thanks.
[16:16:15] <ag4ve> savid: heh, i just happen to have this open: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions
[16:17:01] <blindMoe> $(this).next().animate({width: 'toggle'});   had no idea you could do that
[16:17:32] <bung> if i have var $obj1 = $('#obj1'); and i want to do $('#obj1.active').bind(...) ... is there a way to do it with the $obj1 var?
[16:17:46] <ag4ve> heh, now that you mention it, i didn't either.... that's odd
[16:18:13] <blindMoe> didn't think 'toggle' would be a constant
[16:18:23] <blindMoe> but I guess it makes sense since 'fast' and 'slow' work
[16:19:05] <blindMoe> bung I have never tried this but maybe $obj1.is('.active')   ?
[16:19:44] <bung> blindMoe: i guess i will try and see if it does the bind/on or not that way
[16:19:48] <bung> ? tias @ bung
[16:19:48] <bot-t> bung, Try It And See
[16:23:25] <bung> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/u6C7s/
[16:23:33] <bung> not sure if thats going to work
[16:25:03] <blindMoe> bung: yeah I have only used  $.is(':visible') which makes more sense but I wasn't sure if it would work that way
[16:25:27] <blindMoe> I believe there is $.hasClass()
[16:25:45] <bung> i guess i just have to have an internal if( !$(this).hasClass() ) return false;
[16:25:53] <bung> just thought there might be a clever way to do it outside of the bind
[16:26:24] <Eviltwin> $.fn.hasClass

[16:33:06] <sent-hil> what's the name for plugin that shows hidden divs if you click on a link? i.e. a "more info" button
[16:33:35] <NackNick> does anyone know what a radix parameter is, im getting it on my code =( http://jsfiddle.net/HEb5n/
[16:34:29] <Patabugen> sent-hil: Have you tried doing it with the core .show() function?
[16:35:04] <sent-hil> Patabugen: i need multiple links that show the appropriate divs when click
[16:35:33] <bung> NackNick: when i do parseInt() on a string like '120px', i have to set a radix of 10, ie parseInt('120px',10)
[16:35:44] <bung> thats all i know about it :)
[16:35:50] <Patabugen> sent-hil: Ah fair enough, I don't know then I'm afraid. Unless there's a way to get tabs() in UI to do it
[16:36:23] * NackNick slams head on desk
[16:36:27] <bung> sent-hil: what kind of relation ship do you have
[16:36:46] <sent-hil> bung: ?
[16:36:46] <NackNick> ok i could probably figure that out
[16:36:52] <NackNick> whats a Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[16:37:18] <sent-hil> this one looks interesting: http://plugins.learningjquery.com/expander/index.html
[16:37:33] <NackNick> everything else in my script works flawlessly except when i add the dob validation fucntion in
[16:37:42] <bung> <a href="#" rel="test1">test1</a><div id="test1"></div> ... $('a').click(function(){ $('#'+$(this).attr('rel')).show()});
[16:38:19] <NackNick> which is the http://jsfiddle.net/HEb5n in chrome it says its a Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL but in jsfiddle i get a radix parameter error -_-
[16:40:10] <bung> NackNick: im going to start here http://jsfiddle.net/HEb5n/1/
[16:41:15] <bung> i dont get anything when i run that
[16:41:18] <bung> no errors or output
[16:41:24] <NackNick> you added in a date...
[16:41:39] <NackNick> hmmm
[16:41:47] <NackNick> i think i know what it s
[16:41:48] <NackNick> is
[16:42:19] <NackNick> I have the date in a dropdown menu and then the dropdown menu 1st loads the values are --
[16:42:22] <bung> youre comparing a string dude
[16:42:23] <NackNick> their not numbers
[16:42:26] <bung> youre getting an int
[16:42:47] <bung> http://jsfiddle.net/HEb5n/3/
[16:43:28] <bung> it thinks im 94 years old
[16:43:36] <bung> the math is wrong, but at least its kinda working
[16:44:07] <bung> you gotta turn the firstdate around
[16:44:11] <bung> http://jsfiddle.net/HEb5n/4/
[16:44:19] <bung> lookin good to me
[16:44:25] <simple___> can a jquery master tell me how to go about this.   I've got a generated list of li elements that have the background as a slide thumb.   The client wants when this is hovered over to show text about this slide.   I don't see anyway of connecting text to this slide because there is no class or id to touch upon, nor anything in html, only after orbits slideshow has run.  I have a page example
[16:44:46] <NackNick> nah thats not the problem
[16:44:59] <NackNick> its something with the if(dob != ''){
[16:45:14] <bung> alright mine runs perfectly, so let me know what the different is between that code sample and your local code
[16:45:35] <bung> i fixed the age > '64' as well as the firstdate order
[16:45:48] <bung> simple___: link the example
[16:46:32] <bung> someone might be able to help you if you link the example here
[16:46:35] <bung> dont PM me with it
[16:46:45] <sent-hil> bung: that works, thx!
[16:47:07] <bung> sent-hil: i hope youve made it less generic, but ok
[16:47:52] <sent-hil> bung: yea i added the id of each element from the json response to id/rel links
[16:48:12] <bung> ok, and about the anchors themselves?
[16:48:20] <bung> $('a') binds to all anchors on the page right

[16:54:40] <macclearich_> anyone got time to help debug a very unusual $.ajax problem?
[16:54:43] <macclearich_> http://pastebin.com/PMgtjCRw
[16:55:43] <NackNick> MAWHAHWHWHAHWHWHAHHAHHAHA
[16:55:48] <NackNick> IT WORKS!
[16:56:16] * NackNick pulls out his pistol and shoots in the air
[16:57:16] <bung> macclearich_: the error being?
[16:57:25] <macclearich_> it always sends as GET
[16:57:27] <macclearich_> not POST
[16:57:37] <bung> what the hell is  $.ajax($("#evOptinForm").attr("action"), {
[16:57:39] <macclearich_> despite having type: 'post' in the options
[16:57:52] <macclearich_> pulls the action out of the form tag?
[16:58:05] <bung> oh sorry durr
[16:58:09] <macclearich_> :)
[16:58:20] <macclearich_> since i'm not as sure what it'll be
[16:58:40] <macclearich_> and I know the IDs on those are bunged.  fixing.
[16:58:56] <macclearich_> better version here:
[16:58:57] <macclearich_> http://pastebin.com/yb4hXU7x
[16:59:13] <macclearich_> because silly me forgot to disguise the old form id
[16:59:51] <bung> dumb question, it doesnt have to be POST does it
[17:00:05] <macclearich_> it does
[17:00:16] <macclearich_> believe me, my life would be so much easier if it didn't
[17:00:33] <macclearich_> and it has to be $.ajax because the full version has error handlers
[17:00:40] <macclearich_> or I'd just use $.post instead
[17:00:43] <bung> could you try text instead of json
[17:01:19] <macclearich_> still GET
[17:01:48] <macclearich_> so the full problem is:
[17:01:52] <macclearich_> (and I'm adding this to the paste)
[17:01:54] <bung> tough to get good search terms on this
[17:02:11] <macclearich_> when I call $.ajax on this, it ignores the parameters I'm sending
[17:02:21] <macclearich_> and just does a GET on the page I'm currently on
[17:02:30] <macclearich_> if I do $.post, that works
[17:02:42] <bung> really? lol
[17:02:45] <bung> its just a wrapper isnt it
[17:03:42] <macclearich_> I know, right?
[17:03:53] <macclearich_> that's what's driving me crazy!
[17:03:58] <macclearich_> I was up til 1 last night
[17:04:54] <bung> you say its doing a get on the page youre on instead of the action attr
[17:04:57] <bung> thats weird
[17:04:59] <macclearich_> ayup
[17:05:12] <macclearich_> this is with jQuery 1.7.2
[17:07:43] <bung> http://jsfiddle.net/5gFJm/1/
[17:07:50] <bung> that posts
[17:07:57] <bung> weird
[17:08:02] * bung still googling
[17:09:05] <bung> would you try $.ajaxSetup({type: 'POST'}); at the top of your <script> for kicks
[17:09:09] <macclearich_> yep
[17:09:14] <macclearich_> I did actually try that
[17:09:17] <bung> kk
[17:09:18] <macclearich_> it forces the post, right enough
[17:09:22] <macclearich_> but still ignores the URL
[17:09:24] <macclearich_> and the data
[17:09:32] <macclearich_> and makes me want to throw my coffee mug
[17:10:19] <bung> well so, are you ok to use .post()? i mean is it worth continuing on .ajax?
[17:10:31] <bung> maybe a stackoverflow post would be better, i dont know too much outside of just using it
[17:10:53] <macclearich_> so, the deal is I have to use $.ajax if only because it allows me to set an error handler
[17:10:58] <bung> do you need to set the contentType or anything
[17:11:12] <macclearich_> don't think I do, no
[17:12:38] <macclearich_> if someone knew a genius way to get $.post() to accept more than just the success handler, that would work as well
[17:13:53] <bung> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.post
[17:13:57] <bung> it only does success
[17:14:02] <macclearich_> yup
[17:14:18] <bung> make your own maybe? LoL
[17:14:38] <macclearich_> I'll accept that as a last-ditch option
[17:14:52] <bung> im gonna keep reading, but id start a SO post if you havnt
[17:14:57] <macclearich_> I'm about to
[17:15:15] <macclearich_> would there be anything OTHER THAN ajaxSetup which could cause jQuery to ignore those params?
[17:15:28] <macclearich_> I'm not showing the entire environment here; it's a couple thousand lines of code
[17:15:37] <macclearich_> (and horribly bad code at that)
[17:16:31] <bung> i just wonder if its not happy with what youre sending it to, or what youre trying to send, and it wont let you post
[17:16:46] <macclearich_> well, if you reload that paste
[17:16:51] <macclearich_> http://pastebin.com/yb4hXU7x
[17:16:52] <bung> the radios might serialize to some weird array shit it doesnt like
[17:17:09] <bung> but then again it did work on that jsfiddle i did
[17:17:09] <NackNick> is jsfiddle down for anyone?
[17:17:18] <NackNick> nvm
[17:17:23] <macclearich_> in the same - SAME - method, I call $.post() after the $.ajax() and it works correctly
[17:17:29] <macclearich_> but I just can't handle errors in that
[17:17:35] <macclearich_> which means it's a nonstarter
[17:17:38] <bung> aye
[17:18:07] <macclearich_> I get a whiff that this is something in my environment here that might be futzing with $.ajax, but… what coudl be doing it?
[17:22:34] <bung> btw, what is 'method' on that post source code
[17:22:39] <bung> type: method
[17:23:04] <macclearich_> where's it say that?
[17:23:11] <macclearich_> it says type: 'post'?
[17:23:12] <shoky> sure you can handle errors with $.post
[17:23:15] <bung> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.post
[17:23:23] <shoky> but either way your issue sounds fishy
[17:23:28] <bung> also, have you by chance tried 1.8 to see if it happens
[17:23:41] <macclearich_> word from on high: no upgrade to 1.8 until later
[17:23:54] <bung> it doesnt think thers some x-domain stuff with your action
[17:24:03] <bung> well even just to try it
[17:24:16] <bung> a dev environment?
[17:24:22] <macclearich_> no, there's no x-domain issues.  it's a /whatever url
[17:24:28] <macclearich_> it's on the same machine
[17:24:58] <macclearich_> and shoky: I agree it sounds fishy, that's why I'm wondering if something else could somehow be blowing up $.ajax()
[17:25:07] <macclearich_> that I haven't yet found in the thousands of lines of code in this page
[17:25:50] <shoky> $.post is just a shortcut for $.ajax anyway
[17:25:58] <macclearich_> I know
[17:26:11] <macclearich_> it's a big part of what has me so confused
[17:26:15] <macclearich_> it oughtn't be doing this
[17:26:31] <macclearich_> unless $.ajax() somehow got overwritten?
[17:27:15] <shoky> even if it did, $.post just calls $.ajax
[17:27:37] <macclearich_> so how the heck is this happening? Please don't think that I'm making this up.
[17:28:07] <macclearich_> if you look at the paste, I swear to bob that those two calls in the button handler both fire, one fires as a get, the other as a post
[17:28:13] <macclearich_> and I do not for the life of me understand why
[17:28:37] <bung> sorry can you link the updated paste
[17:28:43] <bung> i dont know how versioning works on pastebin
[17:29:19] <macclearich_> http://pastebin.com/yb4hXU7x
[17:30:08] <macclearich_> shoky, if there's a way to have an error handler and complete handler in a regular $.post, I can do that
[17:30:23] <macclearich_> but as far as I know, $.post only allows a success handler callback
[17:30:40] <shoky> macclearich_:  $.post(...).fail(...).always(...)
[17:30:50] <macclearich_> …
[17:30:50] <shoky> .done(...)
[17:30:54] <macclearich_> that's awesome
[17:30:56] <macclearich_> works in 1.7.2?
[17:30:59] <shoky> yea
[17:31:03] <shoky> but.....
[17:31:09] <shoky> that still doesnt make any sense :P
[17:31:13] <macclearich_> I know!
[17:31:15] <Pasq89> i m building a form. if form submitted before, some data are saved into php session, and set values for form's inputs.. in that case, reset button restores everything as it was.. function i use for reset does: $('#form')....all inputs.val('');
[17:31:21] <macclearich_> I have lost many, many brain cells over this!
[17:31:45] <Pasq89> is something i m missing? if form initial values where empty, this works..
[17:31:49] <macclearich_> and have personally depleted the coffee production of at least one small equatorial nation trying to make it go :)
[17:32:01] <shoky> any way you can link to it?
[17:34:22] <Pasq89> hmm.. found a workaround !
[17:36:10] <Pasq89> posting questions on irc, helps me find solutions easier... :)
[17:43:57] <bung> whats the function alternative for the :gt() selector
[17:44:15] <bung> $('tr:gt(4)') ... $('tr').gt(4)
[17:44:58] <bung> ? slice @ bung
[17:44:59] <bot-t> bung, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[17:52:47] <pensive612> If anyone has a second.  I'm banging my head over a cloning plugin i'm creating for making quick mockups.
[17:53:03] <pensive612> http://jsfiddle.net/adamin/u46Ps/
[17:53:51] <pensive612> I'm able to clone any items. However, when nested items are cloned, it only seems to clone top down.
[17:53:57] <Travis-42> ui tabs says that if you wish to "reuse an existing container" you can do so by matching a title attribute and the containers id. This appears to work, but it ignores the data in the existing container and reloads the content from the server by ajax (even with caching enabled). Is there any way to get tabs to realize that the content in this container is already loaded?
[17:56:39] <macclearich_> shoky, you still around?
[17:57:20] <macclearich_> whether you are or not, it's fixed and I'm one grateful SOB.
[17:58:01] <bung> macclearich_: you went with .done and such?
[17:58:05] <macclearich_> yeah
[17:58:16] <macclearich_> $.post().fail().always()
[17:58:20] <macclearich_> and it bloody well works
[17:58:29] <macclearich_> thanks much for helping me out, both of youse guys
[17:58:35] <macclearich_> seriously just saved my weekend
[17:58:52] <bung> Travis-42: you say even with { cache: true }
[17:59:35] <Travis-42> bung: yes, and I checked the source… it doesn't check whether or not content is already in the container. It just assumes that you want to reuse the container, not that you might have preloaded content
[18:01:06] <bung> i wonder if you could do some hackish load: function( event, ui ){ if($('#existingDiv').length) $(this).tabs('abort') })
[18:01:12] <bung> heh
[18:03:11] <bung> Travis-42: have you also set $.ajaxOptions({ cache: true });
[18:03:17] <bung> outside of the option in the tabs
[18:03:21] <bung> *shrug*
[18:03:28] <bung> hard ajax questions today
[18:05:16] <Travis-42> bung: tried playing with that too. but looking at the source, looks like I may be able to set "data-cache.tabs" to true on the tab, and then it will believe that it's cached. Not documented so I don't like relying on it, but it looks like it should work
[18:09:12] <bung> why cant you pass a jquery object into .on()
[18:09:14] <bung> thats weird
[18:15:14] <rmurphey> bung: how do you want to pass a jquery object to .on() ?
[18:33:26] <bonhoeffer> anyone know what this line does: return this.s(s).indexOf(pattern) > -1;
[18:33:57] <bonhoeffer> this.s(s) is undefined and it is killing my page
[18:33:58] <macclearich_> it returns true or false based on whether a given string pattern appears in another, I think
[18:34:23] <dogmatic69> this.s is a function which seems to return an array
[18:34:44] <macclearich_> I see this.s and I'm wondering if someone tried to do a shorthand toString?
[18:34:59] <macclearich_> so pass in a variable and this.s maybe extracts any string content
[18:35:04] <macclearich_> and then scans it for a given pattern
[18:35:08] <macclearich_> and if found, returns true
[18:35:11] <macclearich_> or of not, false
[18:35:24] <dogmatic69> could be
[18:35:40] <dogmatic69> s() is not really descriptive
[18:35:44] <macclearich_> what's the context of this?
[18:35:50] <macclearich_> I mean, the this keyword :)
[18:38:46] <pixeltarian> has anyone ever come across or does anyone sell a good theme for cPanel?
[18:39:04] <b0xa> theres plenty available
[18:39:05] <pixeltarian> why are web control panels so ugly?
[18:39:12] <b0xa> why not build ur own?
[18:39:26] <b0xa> google 'cpanel themes'
[18:39:37] <pixeltarian> yes thanks. I did that
[18:39:57] <pixeltarian> I'd say maybe one result looks ok.
[18:39:58] <b0xa> i agree though the interface is fairly outdated
[18:40:16] <pixeltarian> even the best theme I found was good-not-great

[18:40:38] <pixeltarian> I just want to sell the admins on it
[18:40:52] <b0xa> gl with that
[18:40:55] <dogmatic69> bonhoeffer: maybe some minify script?
[18:40:55] <pixeltarian> hahah
[18:40:55] <b0xa> if it works...  etc
[18:41:04] <bonhoeffer> not sure
[18:41:18] <bonhoeffer> this.ScriptFragment gives me"<script[^>]*>([\S\s]*?)</script>"
[18:41:31] <pixeltarian> yeah, I feel if I could show them an amazing design they'd possibly add it to the list of awful themes they have on the server already
[18:42:09] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/3802876 <-- dogmatic69, might help

[19:12:47] <pixeltarian> does anyone remember what cloud9 IDE was called when it was just a mozilla onine-editor project?
[19:13:48] <pixeltarian> or... does anyone know of a good text editor for development that can be hosted?
[19:14:16] <rmurphey> depending on what you're after, codemirror or ace editor may be good
[19:14:36] <rmurphey> also, bespin
[19:15:37] <pixeltarian> ahh, bespin is the one I was tring to remember

[19:34:34] <danmichel> the masonry here doesn't look quite right. any ideas why? NSFW http://varmag.com/category/interview/ . thanks in advance for any help
[19:35:29] <tw2113> jQuery not defined danmichel
[19:35:45] <tw2113> touchwipe is not a function
[19:35:51] <tw2113> masonry is not a function
[19:35:58] <danmichel> i see. that's weird
[19:36:28] <tw2113> you have 2 versions of jquery loaded
[19:36:28] <danmichel> thanks tw2113. ill check it out
[19:37:20] <danmichel> i can't imagine why tw2113
[19:37:30] <tw2113> it's what firebug console tells me
[19:39:08] <tw2113> it looks like you're trying to use jquery before it's loaded
[19:40:08] <danmichel> is it still loading 2 tw2113?
[19:40:32] <tw2113> doesn't look like it
[19:40:48] <danmichel> cool. but my top header uses query and that's fine
[19:41:21] <tw2113> <script src="http://24.varmag.com/wp-content/w3tc/min/c28f0/default.include.d617f9.js" type="text/javascript">
[19:41:44] <tw2113> that combined js file uses jquery, but it's not loaded yet, because the jquery lib is loaded afterwards
[19:42:14] <danmichel> tw2113 touch wipe is a function in meteor slides which is a script for the front page
[19:42:24] <tw2113> i don't care whats IN it
[19:42:31] <tw2113> i'm just saying shit's out of order
[19:42:34] <danmichel> tw2113 what can i do about this
[19:42:43] <tw2113> get jquery loaded earlier
[19:43:00] <danmichel> i will try tw2113
[19:45:05] <danmichel> i use headspace 2 which is a plugin that allows you to load jquery only for specific pages. still not sure how to use it
[19:45:28] <tw2113> couldn't tell ya
[19:45:41] <tw2113> something was loading jquery 1.4
[20:04:51] <testmachine> how can i do
[20:05:11] <garbagecollectio> how can i do a non blocking synchronous ajax call
[20:05:24] <garbagecollectio> in jquery
[20:08:22] <EasyCo> Hey guys, when building a jquery plugin, you can access public methods like $.pluginname.fuckingawesomemethod(). But how does it work with a jQuery widget? I thought it would be the same.
[20:10:11] <bung> what is a jquery widget
[20:14:51] <EasyCo> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[20:17:25] <garbagecollectio> hey
[20:17:29] <garbagecollectio> what is jquery complete
[20:17:33] <garbagecollectio> vs success
[20:20:37] <EDK> Is it possible that each tab of jqueryUI holds single form
[20:21:15] <EDK> actually, i have multi tabs and i want to save them one by one ... each tab data save sperately
[20:23:20] <bung> garbagecollectio: complete happens regardless of error or success
[20:23:38] <garbagecollectio> i dont understand the difference between asycn ajax and synchronous ajax
[20:23:41] <bung> EDK anything is possible
[20:23:44] <garbagecollectio> my script works when i do synchronous ajax
[20:23:58] <garbagecollectio> when i use asynch, my looped ajax calls write over each other in the following function
[20:24:00] <bung> the first a in ajax stands for asynchronous
[20:24:15] <bung> which means other things can happen while the ajax is happening
[20:24:15] <garbagecollectio> how can i do asynch ajax without blocking the browser
[20:24:26] <bung> you might want to google a bit
[20:24:33] <garbagecollectio> why
[20:24:50] <bung> to learn something
[20:25:07] <bung> about ajax specifically
[20:25:39] <EDK> <bung> i have big problem dealing with this stuffs.. i have found there are way.. to define.. different pages for each tab...
[20:25:55] <EDK> but inside the each page.. is it possible to create sperate form..
[20:26:01] <bung> can you prepare something on jsfiddle.net
[20:26:12] <EDK> yes.. i can show u
[20:26:26] <garbagecollectio> oh shit so the loop is still going on while the ajax waits to finish?
[20:26:36] <garbagecollectio> is that what would happen?
[20:26:47] <garbagecollectio> if i looped asynchronous ajax requests from an array
[20:26:53] <garbagecollectio> array holding the URL
[20:27:07] <bung> ? asynchronous
[20:27:12] <bung> ?g asynchronous

[20:27:21] <garbagecollectio> bung i kow what this is
[20:27:29] <garbagecollectio> but
[20:27:32] <garbagecollectio> if the success
[20:27:40] <garbagecollectio> calls a function that does some sanitzation
[20:28:00] <garbagecollectio> why would that function be affected
[20:28:08] <garbagecollectio> (overwritten)
[20:30:27] <bung> ? mediumsize @ EDK
[20:30:28] <bot-t> EDK, There should be a happy medium between a tiny sample/explanation and wading through your entire application online.
[20:30:49] <bung> ? reduce @ garbagecollectio
[20:30:49] <bot-t> garbagecollectio, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[20:31:15] <garbagecollectio> bung
[20:31:24] <garbagecollectio> is using a bot the simplest way to tell me this
[20:31:58] <bung> you give no code samples, i have no idea what your trying to do
[20:32:06] <bung> you dont have a good grasp on what ajax is, i suggested googling
[20:32:19] <bung> so either make a sample or google what ajax is
[20:32:32] <bung> ?g jsfiddle
[20:32:47] <bung> ?jsfiddle
[20:33:02] <bung> ? paste @ garbagecollectio
[20:33:12] <bung> hm
[20:33:14] <garbagecollectio> lol
[20:33:20] <garbagecollectio> i do have a good grasp

[20:33:28] <garbagecollectio> have u heard of jquery pipes?
[20:33:29] <bung> there you go
[20:33:32] <garbagecollectio> no
[20:33:38] <garbagecollectio> dude u have to be the most annoying person ever
[20:33:47] <garbagecollectio> u have the gall to tell me
[20:33:54] <garbagecollectio> i dont know what fucking ajax is or how it works?
[20:34:01] <garbagecollectio> cause i asked how to do a non blocking asynchronous call?
[20:34:06] <garbagecollectio> lol
[20:34:15] <garbagecollectio> do u know the difference between asycn and non blocking?
[20:34:33] <garbagecollectio> u have no idea what im trying to do cause u cant understand what i am writing
[20:34:44] <garbagecollectio> u cant comprehend it
[20:34:57] <garbagecollectio> so dont blame u not understanding what im trying to do on me
[20:35:08] <garbagecollectio> ill try and "reduce" it for you
[20:35:26] <garbagecollectio> my async ajax call
[20:35:46] <garbagecollectio> is causing my loop to continue
[20:35:51] <garbagecollectio> the loop is not wiating for the ajax to complete
[20:39:37] <garbagecollectio> and here is the fucking answer

[20:43:43] <chare> bung: NO not a download
[20:43:46] <chare> why isn't it built in
[20:43:50] <chare> i don't want the hassle of downloading
[20:44:13] <bung> did you hear that the developers of that text editor idle here or?
[20:44:38] <chare> bung: are the developers of sublime text planning on adding coffeesrcipt support native
[20:44:50] <bung> are you in the right room?
[20:45:02] <chare> wrong room i don't care
[20:45:09] <bung> good luck with that
[20:46:44] <chare> bung: you use sublime text 2?
[20:47:05] <bung> nope
[20:47:09] <bung> any good?
[20:47:20] <arielserafini> it's great
[20:47:37] <Pasq89> how can i send the: this pointer, of currenlty selected element?
[20:47:48] <arielserafini> Pasq89: ?
[20:47:59] <Pasq89> eg: $('#id1 #id2 #id3).each(updateStatus(this));
[20:48:20] <Pasq89> that this, doesnt work.. :P
[20:48:44] <arielserafini> Pasq89: you need commas in that selector
[20:48:55] <Pasq89> i have..
[20:49:04] <Pasq89> i wrote a simple example here.. :)
[20:49:10] <arielserafini> okay
[20:49:18] <gonssal___> $('#id1, #id2, #id3").each(function(){updateStatus($(this))});
[20:50:31] <Pasq89> works like a charm!
[20:50:34] <Pasq89> :)
[20:50:46] <Pasq89> so.. function() does the trick?
[20:51:55] <Pasq89> that works on some events.. like $( id1 id2 id3).keyup .. and i though "this" now works, because a specific element triggered "keyup" .. thank you
[20:53:15] <arielserafini> Pasq89: when you write updateStatus(this) you're CALLING a function right where it's written
[20:53:34] <arielserafini> Pasq89: .each expects a REFERENCE to a function instead, so it can call it when it needs to
[20:54:17] <arielserafini> that's why wrapping it in function(){ ... } makes it work
[20:54:40] <Pasq89> hmmm.. nice... thanks!
[21:03:56] <MXBrandon> http://jsfiddle.net/mKK7K/4/      In this example, is there a way to call method2() inside the setTimeout function without needing to define parent=this   earlier?
[21:09:34] <Gates> hi
[21:10:50] <bung> MXBrandon: maybe if it was var method2 = function() ?
[21:11:10] <bung> theres something about that, whats the name of it again... hmm
[21:13:11] <bung> function declarations vs function expressions maybe
[21:13:12] <bung> http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/
[21:14:45] <bung> thats the theory for that stuff, not sure if it will let you do what you want though
[21:15:02] <bung> thats a great blogpost now that i think about it
[21:24:22] <MXBrandon> bung: Reading it now, thanks :)
[21:25:08] <bung> its a bit thick for late night reading for me :)
