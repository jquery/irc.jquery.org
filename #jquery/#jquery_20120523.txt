[00:02:08] <auckland> here is hwo it looks
[00:02:26] <auckland> http://imagebin.org/213550
[00:03:29] <Eshu> auckland: r u .net developer
[00:03:42] <auckland> yes..
[00:03:50] <Eshu> cool me to
[00:03:58] <auckland> nice
[00:04:34] <Cork> auckland: i don't know the charter your using, so check its documentation for how you do that
[00:04:36] <auckland> but i am beginner though.. used to be into java.. but microsoft was too good to me.. so decided to give it a try :)
[00:05:55] <auckland> cork: this is how they need the data   data: [20, 30, 50, 70, 60]
[00:06:11] <Cork> and the labels?
[00:06:19] <Ziber> I hate that I'm doing such fun JS stuff and the root cause of my latest problem is a simple HTML thing with tables that I'm not entirely sure how to solve.
[00:06:53] <auckland> there are three set of those
[00:07:56] <auckland> categories: [john, smith, libin, joseph, jose]
[00:08:07] <auckland> those will be rendered as labels
[00:09:10] <Cork> ok, so you would have to restructure your json, or loop the data in js
[00:10:08] <auckland> i actually tried looping
[00:10:31] <Cork> categories: $.map(data, function(o) { return o.Contractor_FirstName; })
[00:11:03] <Eshu> auckland: what chart are you using
[00:11:13] <Cork> or just change the json to { categories: ["", "", "", ""] }
[00:11:18] <auckland> highchart
[00:11:19] <Eshu> is that google charting?
[00:13:31] <auckland> Cork: i am trying it out now
[00:14:02] * Cork afk
[00:19:19] <Whirl3d> Anybody know of a good tutorial for accessing mySQL data for a jquery slideshow?
[00:21:06] <Ziber> At the moment, I could probably write one.
[00:21:09] <tw2113> use php to echo the mysql data into the right spots
[00:22:57] <Whirl3d> tw2113, sure.that's the plan. But as it turns out, I am having some difficulties making it come together and thought that someone here would know of a good resource to use so I don't keep whining for help here. LOL
[00:23:52] <tw2113> which part is failing? the MySQL pulling?
[00:24:04] <tw2113> or getting it into the js/jquery parts?
[00:25:43] <Whirl3d> it appears the mySQL pulling...specifically I don't want to expose my username and password in the script. I figure it's kind of off-topic, so that's why I asked.
[00:26:06] <tw2113> well, never echo on the parts that have the username and password
[00:26:38] <Whirl3d> sure. But there's a way to use include.php in the header to include the connection details
[00:26:40] <tw2113> if you're still worried about that part, have the username/password in a separate file that is included
[00:27:00] <tw2113> <?php include('include.php'); ?>
[00:28:58] <Whirl3d> I guess as I step back and look at the bigger picture, I should just go back to using the mySQL_connect method rather than the PDO API since I know it a little better. It's funny how all of this side stuff is just to get a list of details for the real problem: my first gallery script. LOL
[00:58:43] <daniele_> Hi
[00:59:20] <peiper> does the datepicker/timepicker have a changed event?
[00:59:39] <poppiez> I have a problem on the ipad: I've attached a click handler on a link where I prevent default. while default behavior gets prevented, the address bar shows the URL I prevent navigating to for like 100 ms and then back to the original URL. is this a bug?
[01:01:18] <daniele_> I've to implement the focusout event, but i must use jquery 1.2.6. I Know that this handler has been implemented after 1.4 version. Is there a plugin ? can someone help me ?
[01:03:07] <peiper> daniele_, why do you have to use such an old version?
[01:04:32] <daniele_> I' can't change it, I don't manage de portal.
[01:06:58] <auckland> is there anyone in here
[01:07:22] <Alf__> hey guys i want to use a normal input instead of textarea for my chat... how i can change it ? http://pastebin.com/pusWY5Pp

[01:37:59] <dezzz> Hi
[01:38:35] <dezzz> With an object like: var test = {candy:{name: 'ben', type: 'floss'}}; how can I get the candy? like something like test[0] i want it to output candy
[01:39:00] <dezzz> not {name:'ben',type:'floss'} but the text string 'candy'
[01:40:03] <dezzz> like I can define it as  var test = {'candy':{name: 'ben', type: 'floss'}}; but I haven't figured out how to get just 'candy'
[01:41:25] <koichirose> Hello. I found this code but I'm not sure how to use the 'set_option' function nor how to find documentation about it ^^ http://pastie.org/3954380 hints?
[01:43:24] <dezzz> $('#id').widgetname('option', 'width',200);
[01:43:26] <dezzz> something like that
[01:43:47] <tab1293> anyone know of any services similar to IMDB that distribute information about movies, tv shows, possibly even music that has a free and open web api?
[01:44:12] <dezzz> koichirose> it's jquery UI? here's an example $('#'+id+'_dialog').dialog('option', 'height',obj.height);
[01:45:00] <koichirose> dezzz: it's not but I'll try
[01:45:08] <auckland> tab1293 : try http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1/
[01:45:13] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/b66tXs0g this is withi nthe document ready. Why does proceedCallback() in example 2 get caleld immediately at initialisation wwhereas example 1 does not get called? If a normal function gets called instantly, why does a anonymouse function not get called? also, if proceedcallback is not wrapepd by an anonymosue function, why is "data" not available within that function? Not that in example 2, data shouldn't be specified so that the functio ng
[01:45:40] <koichirose> dezzz: that's it, that was easy :) thank you
[01:45:47] <dezzz> sure =)
[01:46:14] <tab1293> auckland: imdb states it is illegal to use their information to post on other sites
[01:46:18] <poppiez> I have a problem on the ipad: I've attached a click handler on a link where I prevent default. while default behavior gets prevented, the address bar shows the URL I prevent navigating to for like 100 ms and then back to the original URL. is this a bug?
[01:46:21] <tab1293> so pulling from them is no good
[01:47:28] <auckland> tab1293 : this is not IMDB right
[01:47:29] <Trisox> $('a').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); should work
[01:47:55] <Trisox> preventing the href="#" to fire
[01:48:12] <tab1293> auckland: oh my mistake thank you
[01:48:23] <auckland> u welcome
[01:49:38] <auckland> dezz: could you please tell me how I can set a json to a variable in javascript
[01:51:09] <Xotix> auckland: var jsonObj = $.parseJSON(jsonString);
[01:52:09] <Xotix> hmm not json Obj but jsObj.
[01:54:01] <mattyh88> what would be the correct syntax to echo something in the html() function with php? i've tried selector.html("<?php echo 'blabla' ?>"); but that doens't work .. selector.html(<?php echo 'blabla' ?>); doesn't work either :(
[01:54:31] <peiper> whaat?
[01:54:48] <auckland> xotix : will it be in this format [20, 30, 50, 70, 60]
[01:54:56] <auckland> thats how i need it
[01:55:00] <peiper> you cant run php code clientside mattyh88
[01:55:13] <Cork> mattyh88: the first one should work; IF your php should run when the page loads
[01:55:38] <Cork> (and your js is inside a .php file)
[01:55:40] <mattyh88> Cork: hm okay .. i'll investigate some more
[01:55:46] <mattyh88> yes it's inside a php file :)
[01:55:54] <Cork> then ya the first should work
[01:56:07] <peiper> ah now i understand what ure tryin 0.o
[01:56:14] <Cork> mattyh88: check the generated test output
[01:56:30] <peiper> youre missing semicolon after the echo string
[01:56:33] <peiper> maybe thats why?
[01:56:37] <Cork> yes
[01:56:50] <Cork> php will crash without it
[01:57:00] <Cork> (or rather throw an error)
[01:57:06] <peiper> watch tail /var/log/apache2/error.log FTW
[01:57:55] <mattyh88> Cork: this is the actual code in my php file: https://gist.github.com/2774025
[01:58:07] <mattyh88> should work really? :)
[01:58:37] <peiper> no
[01:58:37] <Cork> no
[01:58:43] <peiper> youre missing a semicolon
[01:58:43] <Cork> you have php inside a php string
[01:58:46] <peiper> again^^
[01:59:33] <Cork> replace "<?php echo __(...) ?>" with " . __(...) . "
[01:59:54] <Cork> opps
[02:00:10] <Cork> no it should be  '" . __(...) . "'
[02:01:10] <peiper> https://gist.github.com/4f1a91fb96b4178dd877
[02:01:14] <peiper> try it mattyh88
[02:02:42] <Cork> peiper: you missed the '
[02:02:47] <mattyh88> peiper, doesn't work .. it reads the php as if it's just simple text
[02:03:05] <Cork> uh no that should throw js error
[02:03:18] <auckland> Cork : i did not get ur method to work
[02:03:18] <peiper> 1 stupid question
[02:03:23] <peiper> __ = php function? 0.o
[02:03:33] <auckland> the chart does not load at all now
[02:04:11] <mattyh88> jup got it now :)
[02:04:16] <mattyh88> forgot the ' as cork said :)
[02:04:20] <mattyh88> thx :)
[02:04:33] <mattyh88> it's a specific framework function
[02:04:52] <peiper> where did i missed the ' ?
[02:05:12] <poppiez> I have a problem on the ipad: I've attached a click handler on a link where I prevent default. while default behavior gets prevented, the address bar shows the URL I prevent navigating to for like 100 ms and then back to the original URL. is this a bug?
[02:06:47] <Cork> peiper:  html('" . __(...) . "') not html(" . __(...) . ")
[02:07:12] <Ziber> I can use .val() to set values of hidden input fields, right?
[02:07:14] <dezzz> can you bind 'scroll' on canvas?
[02:07:27] <Cork> Ziber: yes
[02:07:47] <Cork> dezzz: no you would have to bind mouseweel
[02:07:54] <Cork> if thats what you want
[02:07:59] <dezzz> ah cool thanks =)
[02:08:07] <Cork> canvas can't have a scrollbar :)
[02:08:12] <Cork> so no scroll event
[02:08:23] <Cork> uh.. rather it doens't have overflow
[02:08:33] <Ziber> Cork: You mind helping me with a bit of a complicated problem?
[02:08:39] <Ziber> You're my last hope before I call it a night.
[02:08:44] <Cork> lol
[02:08:44] <Ziber> Wed May 23 05:08:44 EDT 2012
[02:08:49] <Cork> ouch >_>
[02:08:58] <Cork> sure go ahead
[02:09:03] <Ziber> Haha, yeah.
[02:09:21] <Cork> its lunch in 51 mins here :)
[02:09:30] <Zhy> "Save me, Cork Wan Kenobi, you are my last hope."
[02:09:49] <Zhy> association :0
[02:09:58] * Cork throws Zhy a lifeline
[02:10:26] * Zhy grabs it and tries to haul himself up again
[02:10:31] <Zhy> Thank you, Cork ! :D
[02:10:36] <Cork> ^^
[02:12:18] <Ziber> Okay, so. http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/user - I have three input fields, email, password, and confirm pass. When the email field is blurred, it checks the validity of whats entered and the availability of it in an sql database (PHP works fine). I have a hidden input field, usernameStatus, that is either going to be set to 0 or 1, 0 for error (either invalid or taken) and 1 for valid/available. The input field never appears to be set. (If you type something...
[02:12:24] <Ziber> into the email field and hit register, you'll see a status message come up, to which I've appended $("#usernameStatus").val(), which seems to be only undefined. I have $("#usernameStatus").val("1") in various places, to no avail.
[02:13:29] <peiper> Ziber Not Found
[02:13:29] <peiper> The requested URL /jquery/user was not found on this server.
[02:13:37] <Ziber> The register button checks to make sure that $("#usernameStatus").val() is 1 before it proceeds.
[02:13:40] <Ziber> s/user/users
[02:13:40] <Ziber> sorry
[02:14:03] <Ziber> http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery/users
[02:18:16] <Cork> Ziber: you have #usernameStatus inside #output
[02:18:27] <Ziber> Hm?
[02:18:28] <Cork> so when you set "Available!" you remove it
[02:18:49] <peiper> yup thats the prob
[02:18:56] * Ziber sighs
[02:19:31] <peiper> when u check the document with firebug after u click register u can see that your hidden inputs are gone
[02:19:43] <Ziber> i've been firebugging all night.
[02:19:50] <peiper> :P
[02:19:51] <Ziber> im not terribly familiar with it yet
[02:20:26] <Ziber> Except... still no good?
[02:21:01] <Ziber> the password div wasnt closed either
[02:21:03] * Ziber sighs
[02:21:21] <Ziber> oh the things you can miss at 5:20am
[02:21:31] <peiper> 11pm here :D
[02:21:44] <Ziber> isnt that like... hawaii time?
[02:21:49] <Zhy> oO
[02:21:53] <Zhy> Europe :D
[02:21:56] <Zhy> ah damn
[02:21:57] <Zhy> pm
[02:21:59] <Zhy> nvm
[02:21:59] <Ziber> :P
[02:22:08] <Ziber> yes, eu = est + 6
[02:22:14] <stenno|work> GMT + 2 ftw o/
[02:22:17] <izual> Hi, I want to use the dialog UI, is this embeded? I cannot find any .js file to downlaod
[02:22:20] <Ziber> but hawaii was either est - 6 or - 9
[02:22:35] * Zhy severs the lifeline himself
[02:22:41] <peiper> it comes with jquery ui izual
[02:22:44] <peiper> www.jqueryui.com
[02:23:05] <izual> thanks peiper
[02:24:29] <Ziber> thanks a lot btw :)
[02:28:33] <Lundy> heya guys, how can I take some json data returned from my query and put it into a table? http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/QsHw4/
[02:29:44] <Eshu> okey Lundy
[02:29:47] <Eshu> wait
[02:30:44] <peiper> inside the show_response function you can simply build the table? but <table> tags arount the each-loop and put <tr>/<td>'s inside
[02:30:46] <Lundy> I know im doing it wrong here :/
[02:32:51] <Eshu> yes you are doing wrong something there
[02:34:19] <laerti2> How can i add classes to auto generated divs from php?
[02:34:55] <rue> You find the divs, and then add the classes
[02:35:05] <Lundy> Iv done this http://jsfiddle.net/QsHw4/2786/ but now im getting a double the amount into info (as if it loops twice)
[02:35:20] <Xotix> $('#imgTrans input').keypress(function() { is there somethign similar to this but which includes checkboxes?
[02:35:44] <laerti2> yes but they has the same same class and i want to hide one of them, but if i display:NONE  they are all gone cause they have the same class
[02:36:45] <peiper_> laerti2 $(selector).toggle(); or hide() or show()
[02:37:51] <laerti2> peiper_:    this is the link  and i want to hide the company name  http://duabiznes.com/aitanew/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6:dm-consulting-services&lang=en

[02:50:32] <Lundy> Heya guys, could someone help me here .... here is the data im getting back from a json request but im unsure how I can place each value into a table.......
[02:50:33] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/QsHw4/2788/
[02:58:28] <mansour> I need to request data from the server for each item after page loads. What do I need to use ??
[02:59:01] <lb> Lundy: http://jsfiddle.net/QsHw4/2789/
[03:08:49] <Lundy> lb if im getting a return off say "[Object { product_id="1", code="0.52CSCREENED", description="0.5 2C SCREENED CABLE [M]"}, Object { product_id="2", code="00000000001", description="THIS IS PRODUCT TWO "}]" how can I get the product code 1 ?
[03:08:56] <Lundy> or 2
[03:09:38] <lb> Lundy: that's not valid json
[03:09:47] <Lundy> oh
[03:09:56] <lb> jsonlint.com
[03:09:58] <mansour> json should have ":" as a separator
[03:10:46] <stenno|work> json _has_ : as seperator
[03:10:56] <lb> what stenno|work says
[03:10:59] <mansour> any one can tell me how to modify an attribute for multiple elements with values queried from the server ??
[03:11:04] <stenno|work> >> JSON.parse("{temp: 23}");
[03:11:08] <stenno|work> oh sorry
[03:11:17] <Cork> you need strings for keys too
[03:11:35] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"temp": 23}')
[03:11:36] <caniuse> Cork: { temp: 23 }
[03:11:36] <stenno|work> right, mixed it up with javascript object
[03:11:38] <lb> http://www.json.org/
[03:11:44] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{temp: 23}')
[03:11:45] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token t'
[03:11:52] <stenno|work> yeah
[03:12:30] <Lundy> hmmmmmmm
[03:14:25] <mansour> how do I select the <div> surounding the $(this) ??
[03:14:46] <Cork> mansour: .closest('div')
[03:14:49] <mansour> I mean I have <div> <img....> </img></div>
[03:15:01] <mansour> Cork: think you a loooooooot
[03:15:03] <Cork> or if its always the closest parent use parent()
[03:15:20] <Cork> closest is normally a bit more stable

[03:38:54] <wild_oscar> hi. when having the minified version in the web path I get an error in Eclipse complaining about the syntax. someone at eclipse said it should be there, because minified versions should not be used for development. while I agree, he wasn't able to answer the follow-up: how do people usually separate development and production code, concerning jquery's full vs minified versions?

[04:03:16] <zafi> Hello. I have a question regarding the selector syntax. I need to find <image> tags in an svg with a specific href attribute. When using the following syntax $('#chart image[href^=foo]') nothing is found, but going the detour with siblings() á la $(#chart image').siblings('image[href^=foo]') the correct images are found. is this a bug?
[04:39:28] <eshlox> type = $('select[name=type]').val(); doesnt work in IE, any ideas how get selected value in IE?
[04:42:19] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[04:42:38] <Double_Rainbow> how do i verify if a string contains "http://"
[04:42:47] <Double_Rainbow> in jquery ?
[04:42:59] <Double_Rainbow> thanks....
[04:44:32] <Zhy> you can use only javascript for that http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp
[04:45:12] <Zhy> if(string.indexOf('http://') == -1 ) { alert('not contained'); }
[04:45:33] <Zhy> string being your string
[04:45:39] <Double_Rainbow> great
[04:45:51] <Double_Rainbow> and how do i append http to any string ?
[04:46:14] <Zhy> var newstring = 'http://'+anystring ?
[04:46:22] <Double_Rainbow> ah lol
[04:46:25] <Zhy> :D
[04:46:54] <Double_Rainbow> thanks Zhy
[04:47:01] <Zhy> you're welcome
[04:51:28] <eshlox> i hate IE ;-S
[04:53:16] <anli_> r is null in ckeditor, is that corrected?
[04:53:35] <Double_Rainbow> i say Micro$oft should stick with making Operating Systems and keep the task of making browsers to others

[04:59:58] <lost123> u need to add jquery ui to get accordion work?
[05:00:04] <eshlox> $('select[name=type]').val(); this is correct, right?
[05:01:11] <Trisox> that equals <select name="type" .....
[05:01:16] <Trisox> but you need the option ;)
[05:01:24] <Trisox> select doesnt have a val
[05:01:46] <Trisox> $('select[name="type"] option').val();
[05:01:48] <Trisox> eshlox
[05:04:16] <eshlox> Trisox: doesnt work in ie ;-p
[05:04:59] <eshlox> maybe is another way to get value of selected option
[05:05:54] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into an html table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226
[05:07:10] <Trisox> ill show you 1 sec
[05:08:05] <noregret> Trisox: thanks
[05:08:20] <Xotix> if i have an input and the keydown event on it. and withi nthe key down event i console.log the value of the input. how can i make sure, the input is there so the output is correct to the current value? using a timeout?
[05:13:32] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/GcKBBv3m e.g. this. can i make it better somehow?
[05:15:14] <soee> hi, how can i get element right upper corner position ?
[05:16:04] <Trisox> noregret: sorry got a call
[05:16:05] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/R5D4H/
[05:16:43] <pachet> Xotix: yeah, that's best - except you should clear the previous timeout, if its already been set
[05:17:00] <noregret> Trisox: what's what ?
[05:17:04] <noregret> what's that *
[05:17:15] <Xotix> pacht previous?
[05:17:19] <Xotix> pachet:
[05:17:21] <Trisox> way to select the option that is selected?
[05:17:42] <noregret> Trisox: why would I need that ?
[05:17:43] <pachet> Xotix: yeah, you dont assign it to anything in what you pasted
[05:17:50] <Trisox> you asked for that right?
[05:17:52] <Trisox> lol
[05:17:58] <noregret> Trisox: did you take a look at my paste ?
[05:18:09] <pachet> Xotix: basically just throttling the logic - but maybe you dont want that <shrug>

[05:18:21] <noregret> Trisox: ^^
[05:18:30] <Xotix> pachet assign a setTimeout? to the window obejct. i jsut want to wait until the browser took the incoming vlaue and wrote it as the value of the input.
[05:18:36] <Trisox> it was for eshlox
[05:18:38] <Trisox> :P
[05:18:39] <Trisox> eshlox

[05:19:31] <pachet> soee: var elem = $('#foo'), offset = elem.offset(), coords = { x : offset.left + elem.width(), y : offset.top };
[05:21:45] <Xotix> pachet what to you mean by assigning the timeout to something? is there a different use case for setTimeout as waiting for x seconds? or ms.
[05:23:17] <Ortix> Hello, I'm in the dire need of help. I have to finish up someone elses project and I am stuck on a very simple thing
[05:23:38] <Ortix> it's very hard to explain in words, so i'll use a picturei nstead
[05:24:28] <pachet> Xotix: its just input throttling, that's all - you dont have to implement it if you dont want to
[05:24:36] <Ortix> this is the form
[05:24:36] <Ortix> http://s8.postimage.org/pltejedk3/Capture.png
[05:24:50] <Ortix> when one of the 3 buttons is clicked, several values are sent to a script
[05:25:02] <yango> What's a good mechanism to ensure that ajax requests are sent in the order they occur with a decent timeout between them?
[05:25:23] <ndugu> hi. i want my pictures to be fully centered without sliding, just fading when you click
[05:25:23] <yango> I tried doing something with a boolean flag and setTimeout() but in practice it's not ensuring order
[05:25:25] <Ortix> there is an onclick attribute on the images which uses a custom JS script to get the values of the form and send it to the script
[05:25:25] <ndugu> http://pastebin.com/Lha8UBZU
[05:25:34] <Ortix> I need to include the MPI parameter
[05:25:45] <ndugu> i've seen the two examples
[05:25:53] <Ortix> so if anyone is willign to help me?..
[05:25:58] <Ortix> i'd explain more
[05:26:00] <Xotix> pachet i have to since i need the current value
[05:26:00] <LukeNukem> Cork, hey can you show me that $.map thing again? :\
[05:26:27] <ndugu> will someone help me?
[05:26:43] <LukeNukem> ndugu, sup?
[05:26:50] <ndugu> LukeNukem: http://pastebin.com/Lha8UBZU
[05:26:55] <Xotix> pachet you jsut weird me up with "clear previous timeout" since i don't know why you think there is a previous one
[05:26:58] <ndugu> i want my pictures to be fully centered without sliding, just fading when you click
[05:26:58] <anli_> Cant $.cookie('foo', null); be used to clear a cookie?
[05:27:09] <Cork> LukeNukem: what about it?
[05:27:16] <LukeNukem> ndugu, what about it?
[05:27:24] <ndugu> what can i do to my code?
[05:27:26] <Ortix> i'm not that good with JS so I did this
[05:27:27] <Ortix>     str += '&mpi='+document.selectSubject.elements['mpi_enabled'].value;
[05:27:35] <LukeNukem> Cork, i wanted to store all the href values of an element in an array, i lost the snippet you gave me ;\
[05:27:45] <Ortix> which I think would get the value of the checkbox named mpi_enabled
[05:27:47] <LukeNukem> ndugu, what exactly do you want to achieve?
[05:27:52] <Ortix> and append it to the url
[05:27:54] <Cork> LukeNukem: its not of an element its of a group of links
[05:28:02] <ndugu> i want my pictures to be centered
[05:28:08] <ndugu> or the whole page, really
[05:28:13] <LukeNukem> ndugu, more like a css question dont you think?
[05:28:23] <ndugu> oh
[05:28:28] <ndugu> wrong channel, you think?
[05:28:30] <Cork> LukeNukem: $.map($('a'), function(elm) { return $(elm).prop('href'); });
[05:28:31] <LukeNukem> Cork, can you show me how its done once more?
[05:28:40] <Cork> i was on my way
[05:28:45] <Cork> just had to type it out :
[05:28:48] <Cork> *:)
[05:29:07] <LukeNukem> ah i forgot the $ in the callback, that was the problem
[05:29:17] <LukeNukem> i used attr instead of prop tho
[05:29:32] <Cork> attr will get the exact string you have in the html tag
[05:29:38] <Cork> prop will get the full url
[05:29:44] <anli_> Will jquery tabs add something to the cookie name?
[05:29:44] <Cork> so its up to you what you want
[05:29:45] <soee> how can i get some content with ajax call and append it to body ?
[05:30:08] <Cork> soee: .load is the simplest way
[05:30:11] <LukeNukem> Cork, what do you mean, im confused about that. isn't the same thing tho?
[05:30:23] <Cork> soee: but just get it and append it to the body
[05:30:38] <soee> Cork, ok ill tru
[05:30:39] <soee> *try
[05:31:05] <nFFFF> How does a liveticker like facebooks livefeed work
[05:31:23] <nFFFF> Is it just an iterative ajax request
[05:31:28] <nFFFF> every 5 seconds
[05:31:29] <LukeNukem> nFFFF, no
[05:31:35] <LukeNukem> its realtime.
[05:31:35] <Cork> LukeNukem: ex. <a href="img/p.png"> -- $('a').attr('href') == 'img/p.png'; $('a').prop('href') == 'http://www.example.com/full/url/img/p.png';
[05:31:55] <nFFFF> LukeNukem, but how does the client know when to get the data from the server?
[05:32:07] <LukeNukem> ah okay thanks Corey
[05:32:09] <LukeNukem> Cork*
[05:32:18] <ndugu> LukeNukem: so you don't know?
[05:32:25] <LukeNukem> ndugu, you should ask #css
[05:32:28] <nFFFF> It has to be a recursive ajax request
[05:32:32] <ndugu> im doing it :)
[05:32:35] <nFFFF> like every 5 seconds
[05:32:42] <LukeNukem> nFFFF, no. That will be stupid
[05:32:47] <LukeNukem> hammering the server every 5 seconds.
[05:32:57] <LukeNukem> ndugu, here is a tip -> margin: 0 autol
[05:33:00] <LukeNukem> auto;
[05:33:09] <nFFFF> LukeNukem, so how is it done then....
[05:33:10] <ndugu> in?
[05:33:30] <ndugu> .slideshow or .slideshow img?
[05:33:36] <LukeNukem> nFFFF, every time there is new data, it is pushed to the client.
[05:33:43] <pietia> i have a weird problem with query.ui and IE. i use several query plugins like, notifybar, multiselect. All hose plugins work nicely in chrome / ff but i've figured out that there is no background and proper styles for all jquer.ui-based widget in IE. is it know problem? some gotcha?
[05:34:01] <LukeNukem> nFFFF, look into Ape Server(this is what you want if you want just real time stuff) or nodeJS(if you want js server side)
[05:34:10] <LukeNukem> ndugu, depends on what you want to be centered.
[05:34:26] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into an html table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226
[05:34:54] <nFFFF> 'pushed' to the client?
[05:34:57] <nFFFF> What does that even mean
[05:34:59] <LukeNukem> i think you can use foreach :P if jquery has it
[05:34:59] <ndugu> LukeNukem: pictures and text
[05:35:02] <LukeNukem> javascript*
[05:35:12] <ndugu> LukeNukem: but first and foremost the pictures in the slideshow
[05:35:15] <LukeNukem> ndugu, well, whatever element contains it..You should apply that property onto it
[05:35:27] <ndugu> ok :)
[05:35:37] <LukeNukem> nFFFF, the client is always connected
[05:35:44] <LukeNukem> its confusing, the logic of it.
[05:36:44] <lb> Lundy: found your bug?
[05:37:00] <nFFFF> From what Ive just read it uses long polling: client connects to server -> stays connected until new info -> connection closes and ata returned to client -> new connection
[05:37:20] <eshlox> Trisox: ok, it works, thanks
[05:38:13] <Trisox> eshlox: ;-) hf
[05:38:55] <nFFFF> LukeNukem, or perhaps not, just reading another stackoverflow that suggest different
[05:39:48] <nFFFF> Ape or Comet was suggested
[05:39:52] <nFFFF> Ill have to read up
[05:40:18] <g0rd0n> .
[05:42:08] <soee> Cork, using load() can i somehow assign returned content into variable  (not putting inside any container)?
[05:44:16] <MacroMan> How do I get the value from the name attribute of an element?
[05:44:25] <Cork> soee: no then you want to use $.get instead
[05:44:33] <Cork> ?.get @ soee
[05:44:35] <MacroMan> $('#my_ele').name(); ???
[05:44:35] <mansour> I have this script http://pastebin.com/NS1S8srY and I am trying to call ajax request for each $('img') to set its @src

[06:01:44] <moijkm> hum. i got a jquery ui datepicker, and currently displays the selected date formatted one way. but iwant to fetch the unixtime out of it. how do i do that?
[06:02:45] <Lachezar> Hello colleagues. Can I make the toggle() animation work only on height, and not on width?
[06:03:32] <soee> how can i slide container from right to left ?
[06:03:48] <Xotix> soee:  Lachezar animate()
[06:03:51] <sjobidoo> I'm trying to use animate() to make an object move to the right at the same time as it loops an animation. (trying to make the object wobble up and down along the y-axis as it moves along the x-axis) :) .  I'm using the jquery easing plugin as well..but if it set queue: false to the x-movement it seems to not regard the duration i've set on the animation :/
[06:04:30] <Cork> soee: $(elm).css('left', <start pos>).animate({ left: 0 }, 500);
[06:05:44] <soee> Cork, container is placed at the right browser side, and i need it to slideot from the right browser border
[06:05:44] <inad922> hello
[06:06:06] <inad922> Is there anyone here who used the jquery.textshadow plugin from https://github.com/heygrady/textshadow
[06:06:30] <sjobidoo> soee: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide    , this should help you out :)
[06:07:03] <inad922> it only seem to accept px values for offset and blur radius and I don't know how I can convert em values for a given a rendered textpiece to px
[06:07:09] <soee> is there some configurator where i can select effects do download etc ?
[06:08:00] <sjobidoo> soee: http://jqueryui.com/download
[06:08:01] <Cork> soee: theres effects bundled with jquery
[06:08:18] <Cork> you don't need to download anything
[06:08:19] <sjobidoo> in the link i gave ya you can choose what you want
[06:09:42] <soee> Cork, ?
[06:10:13] <Cork> these effects are bundled with jquery http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[06:10:30] <Lachezar> Xotix: Nice: .animate({"height": "toggle", "opacity": "toggle"}, "fast");
[06:10:48] <Lachezar> Xotix: How can I make two animations on two elements synchronized.
[06:12:10] <Lachezar> Xotix: I need to fade and hide one element and show and expand another one in its place. If I apply animation to both, they get out-of-sync and there is some page jumping up and down.
[06:12:52] <Xotix> Lachezar: oh… i don't know. they get queued and if you turn off the queue it will suck. as you noticed probably. hmm read about the queuing
[06:13:47] <anli_> Is r is null still a problem with ckedit? The proposed solution to add the text <p>&nbsp;</p> is not working
[06:14:50] <Lachezar> Xotix: Well they're not queued per se (they work at the same time), but there is some small discrepancy, as if they work at inconsistent speeds :-/;
[06:15:48] <mansour> how can I modify "img"s onload with and populate it with data obtained from the server after loading ???
[06:16:06] <Lachezar> Xotix: TBH I am trying to create accordion style behaviour without using jQueryUI (I can't change the page structure).
[06:16:29] <Cork> mansour: you can't really overide inline img onload
[06:16:37] <Cork> they might happen before you get to them
[06:17:32] <mansour> Cork: I need to populate it with the src attr. That's all.
[06:17:49] <Cork> so it doesn't have a src?
[06:18:20] <Cork> does it have an inline onload or what do you mean with overide?
[06:18:21] <mansour> it has a loader-animation.gif
[06:18:40] <Cork> and the onload is for that image?
[06:18:44] <mansour> no, all it does is the loader-animation.
[06:18:52] <mansour> onload for the page
[06:19:15] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[06:19:18] <mansour> I mean when I load the DIV that contains those images, I need to modify them
[06:19:33] <Cork> page onload isn't triggered if you insert html
[06:20:24] <mansour> Cork: I missed that one. I was not clear.
[06:20:47] <Xotix> Lachezar: i never had to animate 2 items at the same time. read about the queuing. hwo it queues etc
[06:21:34] <mansour> there's a DIV contains those img tags and I need to replace each src in those images with a value obtained from the server. Here's the code that's not working @ line 40 http://pastebin.com/NS1S8srY
[06:21:34] <Lachezar> How can I combine $(this).next() and $("div.title + :visible") with one selector?
[06:21:43] <Xotix> Lachezar did yo utry to just disable the queuing
[06:22:09] <Lachezar> Xotix: Ugh... I have to check how to do that...
[06:22:47] <lost123> hi i have added the jquery.ui.accordian but my accordion doesn't work, any idea?
[06:22:58] <lost123> when i add jquery-ui.js it works
[06:23:04] <Xotix> Lachezar: from teh docs http://pastebin.com/8aqFzrnM you can make a selector separated by , i think
[06:23:52] <Lachezar> Xotix: I tried that, but the first is NOT a selector :-/
[06:23:52] <pietia> i have a weird problem with query.ui and IE. i use several query plugins like, notifybar, multiselect. All hose plugins work nicely in chrome / ff but i've figured out that there is no background and proper styles for all jquer.ui-based widget in IE. is it know problem? some gotcha?
[06:24:44] <Xotix> Lachezar: $(this, "div.title + :visible") doesn't work? never tried it but i think it should. but i'm absolutely not sure
[06:25:03] <Lachezar> Xotix: I need $(this).next()
[06:25:43] <Lachezar> Xotix: $($(this).next(), 'div.title + :visible').animate() applies animation to the first only.
[06:27:13] <Xotix> Lachezar uh never did somethign liek this. Try each() no guarante how nice this solution is.
[06:28:15] <jonkersjoe> hi just wondering if anyone has problems with .hover where the hover out function is called even thought the mouse has not moved out of the element ?
[06:28:25] <Lundy> Heya how can I put my product_id into a LINK so that I can call it when I click on the link? at the moment im using <a class="show_hidden">View</a> is it like data-product_id="1" >>
[06:28:26] <Lundy> ??
[06:29:29] <vlad27aug> Lachezar: I think $(this).next() returns only one element...so to wrap it in another jquery object with the context 'div.title + :visible' seems overhead
[06:30:26] <vlad27aug> nevermind...just checked...it's not just one element
[06:31:05] <Cork> it is
[06:31:13] <Cork> its an array with always only one element
[06:31:18] <Lachezar> vlad27aug: next() is an iterator of the elements that are next to those matched by the selector. Nifty!
[06:31:18] <vlad27aug> actually no...I'm right...it's just one
[06:31:42] <Lundy> anyone?
[06:31:48] <Lachezar> I can do: $('div.title').next().toggle() and it toggles all elements next to a title.
[06:31:56] <vlad27aug> it returns exactly one element following each element already selected
[06:32:15] <vlad27aug> so if you have 3 elements sel3ected...with .next() you will get a maximum of 3 elements
[06:33:02] <Lachezar> Well. .next() returns a jQuery, so you can do anything as if it was a selector.
[06:33:11] <vlad27aug> in a list with 100 list elements if you select the frist 'li' and apply .next() on it you should get only the second li
[06:33:20] <vlad27aug> not the next 99 elements
[06:34:27] <Lachezar> vlad27aug: I am not sure. I am not using next() to match elements that match th eoriginal selector.
[06:35:08] <Lachezar> BUT! I have 3 <div class='title'> followed by <div> (not title), and I can hide all with $('div.title').next().toggle(false);
[06:35:22] <Lachezar> Divs in pairs
[06:37:39] <Lachezar> The way I see it $('???').next() is roughly equivalent to $('??? + *')
[06:37:52] <Lachezar> But I *AM* a jQuery nebie.
[06:37:58] <Lachezar> *newbie.
[06:38:09] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into a table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226
[06:38:13] <Cork> Lachezar: its not
[06:38:35] <Lachezar> Cork: What's the difference?
[06:38:36] <Cork> $('???').next is the same as $('??? + *)
[06:38:40] <Cork> * $('??? + *')
[06:38:46] <Cork> uhh
[06:38:48] <Cork> read wrong >_<
[06:38:55] <Cork> Lachezar: so yes your correct
[06:38:56] <Flanagan> hello :-) is something like this possible: $('.anmeldungsuccess').html("../templates/anmelden_lastschrift_erfolg.html"); To get a page?
[06:39:13] <lost123> my accordion is not working can anyone help
[06:39:15] <Lachezar> Cork: Nice. Except for $(this).next() that is very useful!
[06:39:19] <Cork> (read it as $('???' + ' *');
[06:39:32] <Cork> Lachezar: yes, nextAll is nice too
[06:40:12] <lost123> http://tinyurl.com/7hq7lz2
[06:40:41] <lost123> the accordion is on the element #homenews
[06:43:20] <Lachezar> lost123: It looks like you have accordion added twice: Once from the jquery.ui.accordion.js and once from jquery-ui-1.8.20.custom.js
[06:43:28] <Lundy> how can I clear anything in a table which isnt the <th> ??
[06:43:39] <Lundy> like anything below <th> ?
[06:43:49] <Lachezar> lost123: I don't think that's how it should work.
[06:44:18] <Lachezar> Lundy: I would put all th in <thead><tr>, anything else in <tbody><tr> and clear the <tbody>
[06:45:27] <lost123> i have accordian.js once now Lachezar
[06:45:34] <lost123> but that doesn't work either
[06:46:11] <Lachezar> lost123: Remove the accordion! It's part of jquery-ui-custom. And you have to include it *AFTER* the jquery.js inclusion!
[06:46:51] <lost123> when i include the jquery-ui-custom my slider breaks
[06:47:24] <lost123> because i already had jquery.ui.widget  , jquery.ui.buttons etc included
[06:47:35] <lost123> may be thats the reason
[06:47:46] <venus_> hello, i have this page here, it is loading good in firefox and chrome, but giving some error in IE, http://www.cammanning.com/home/ Can anyone guide me how to fix it thanks !
[06:47:55] <Lachezar> Well... Add the jquery.ui.accordion where you're including the other UI elements.
[06:51:41] <Lachezar> How can I get the maximum height of many elements without using .each(...)? Something like $('div.title').height().max()?
[06:53:20] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into a table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226 is there any dynamic table that allows me to insert cells anywhere ?
[06:54:03] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: why don't you want to use .each? any other solution would use .each underneath anyway
[06:54:33] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Clarity! Found it: maxh = Math.max($('div.title').height());
[06:54:48] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: So damn beautiful and clear.
[06:55:38] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: but .height() returns a single number
[06:55:52] <johnkpaul> I don't think that's doing what you think it is Lachezar
[06:56:01] <johnkpaul> ?eval Math.max(10)
[06:56:03] <bot-t> johnkpaul: 10
[06:56:15] <Brodingo> Lachezar http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/5KxRn/
[06:56:24] <Lachezar> ?eval Math.max(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2);
[06:56:25] <bot-t> Lachezar: 5
[06:56:32] <Lachezar> Yei!
[06:56:55] <johnkpaul> sure, but you're not calling Math.max with multiple arguments, you're passing one argument
[06:56:56] <venus_> ?eval Math.max(4,3,2,4,5,7);
[06:56:57] <bot-t> venus_: 7
[06:56:58] <gho5t> isn't $('div.title').height() just going to return the first item in the array
[06:57:14] <johnkpaul> gho5t: it returns the height of the first item in the jq object
[06:57:28] <gho5t> right that's what i meant
[06:57:32] <johnkpaul> $("div.title").height() == $("div.title").first().height()
[06:58:38] <gho5t> do you hear that Lachezar
[06:59:28] <Lachezar> ?eval Math.max([1,3,2]);
[06:59:29] <bot-t> Lachezar: NaN
[06:59:29] <johnkpaul> :) hopefully Lachezar is just using Brodingo's solution and not worrying about this
[06:59:32] <Lachezar> Damn.
[06:59:36] <Brodingo> yeah haha
[06:59:42] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: if you want to do that, use apply
[06:59:55] <johnkpaul> ?Eval Math.max.apply(Math, [1,3,2])
[06:59:55] <bot-t> johnkpaul: 3
[07:00:11] <noregret> can anyone take a look at my json please
[07:00:20] <Lachezar> I had a bad assumption, it turns out my highest element was laso first.
[07:00:24] <Lachezar> Will fix it.
[07:01:09] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: This seems a bit uglier, but it it works... *shrug*
[07:02:09] <Brodingo> ?mlu
[07:02:10] <bot-t> much like urself
[07:02:35] <johnkpaul> bazinga
[07:02:58] <toxz> hi! i want to create elements, put them into a list and insert the list at the end into the dom. what kind of list do i have to use, to append it via jquery?
[07:03:00] <johnkpaul> noregret: take a look at the jquery data tables plugin
[07:03:22] <johnkpaul> toxz: you mean ol vs ul? jquery doesn't care
[07:03:55] <Ortix> i have a bunch of checkboxes in a column and I use a jquery script to change it's value when it's checked or unchecked
[07:03:57] <Ortix> however
[07:04:03] <Ortix> it only works for the first checkbox
[07:04:29] <toxz> johnkpaul - no something like this - http://pastebin.com/yBPkah3e - but array doesnt work
[07:04:49] <Ortix> http://pastebin.com/s0NKngHa
[07:04:53] <Ortix> pastebin
[07:05:08] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ toxz
[07:05:09] <bot-t> toxz, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[07:05:31] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Found where I was mislead. I thought .height() would return a jQuery as most other methods. Bad assumption ;(
[07:05:37] <johnkpaul> Ortix: that's not how you set a select box to checked
[07:05:40] <toxz> johnkpaul - http://jsfiddle.net/e7sm4/
[07:05:53] <johnkpaul> Ortix: try .prop("checked", true")
[07:06:07] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: that's the first thing that I told you :)
[07:06:13] <toxz> Array seems not to work for append
[07:06:41] <Ortix> johnkpaul: let me try that!
[07:06:42] <johnkpaul> toxz: that code isn't complete
[07:06:48] <johnkpaul> where is $suggetion defined?
[07:07:01] <Lundy> heya guys iv got a json return off this (this is the console.log response) how can I print the value off code?? Object { product_id="2", code="00000000001", description="THIS IS PRODUCT TWO ", more...}

[07:07:02] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[07:07:25] <johnkpaul> an array of elements should work fine

[07:07:49] <toxz> johnkpaul - i know its not complete - i need a container to collect span-elements in, which i can append once afterwards
[07:08:12] <johnkpaul> toxz: ok, so from the that code, I can't really tell what is wrong
[07:08:13] <toxz> array should work? mmm
[07:08:18] <johnkpaul> because I don't know what $suggestion is
[07:08:29] <Ortix> johnkpaul: still gives same result, only first element changes its value
[07:08:56] <johnkpaul> Ortix: where in your code are you changing multiple elemtns?
[07:09:07] <toxz> johnkpaul - http://jsfiddle.net/e7sm4/1/

[07:09:34] <Ortix> okidoki 1 sec
[07:09:55] <Lachezar> What's the return value of .each()?
[07:10:07] <johnkpaul> toxz: I can't see anything wrong with that code, perhaps try moving appending inside the loop to debug
[07:10:12] <Brodingo> Lachezar a jquery object
[07:10:13] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: the original jquery object
[07:10:49] <Lachezar> Doh! *Face-Palm*
[07:11:32] <toxz> johnkpaul - Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8  was the error. but thank you. ill take a deeper look now. i though array is not the way to do it
[07:11:57] <johnkpaul> no problem toxz
[07:12:17] <venus_> hello, i have this page here, it is loading good in firefox and chrome, but giving some error in IE, http://www.cammanning.com/home/ Can anyone guide me how to fix it thanks !
[07:14:44] <vl1234> @venus
[07:14:53] <vl1234> wt is the problem u fased
[07:15:03] <vl1234> faced
[07:16:22] <Ortix> http://jsfiddle.net/ZJdns/
[07:16:33] <Ortix> so whenever I click a checkbox only ITS value should change to 1
[07:16:39] <Ortix> now it doesn't seem to work at all
[07:16:56] <Ortix> johnkpaul: i posted the demo above
[07:17:08] <jugglinmike> http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679878/mits-freaky-non-stick-coating-keeps-ketchup-flowing
[07:17:11] <jugglinmike> "It just floats right onto the sandwich," Smith says.
[07:17:38] <venus_> vl1234, it is not loading the slideshow on top
[07:18:39] <johnkpaul> Ortix: id needs to be unique on a page
[07:18:48] <johnkpaul> you have 4 different elements with id #mpi_checkbox
[07:19:03] <Ortix> oh shi-
[07:19:27] <Ortix> so what does this entale?
[07:19:55] <johnkpaul> remove the ids, if they are for styling, add classes
[07:19:57] <vl1234> @venus for which version not workin
[07:20:18] <johnkpaul> can you describe what you're trying to do, Ortix? when one checkbox is checked, you want all fo them to be checked?
[07:20:23] <johnkpaul> and if one is unchecked, you want all to be unchecked?
[07:20:28] <vl1234> @venus its workin fine in IE 9 compat view
[07:20:55] <Ortix> johnkpaul: no no, when I check 1 checkbox, I want ITS value to change to 1
[07:20:58] <Ortix> only of that checkbox
[07:21:10] <Ortix> and when i uncheck it, the value back to 0
[07:21:40] <johnkpaul> Ortix: :) that's kinda the point of the checkbox by itself
[07:21:43] <johnkpaul> you don't need jquery to do that
[07:22:00] <johnkpaul> the checkbox is a boolean already, it's either checked or not
[07:22:07] <vl1234> @venus......which jquery version u r using
[07:22:11] <Ortix> I know I know, but for my purpose i do need it
[07:22:32] <Ortix> working on someone elses website and he uses a weird way to get its value
[07:22:50] <Ortix> usually i'd use a $_GET to get the value, but in this case i HAVE to use this solution
[07:23:00] <Famic> anyone knows how to have a placeholder replacement that works in IE7/8 ?
[07:23:14] <Ortix> so if you could help me out i'd greatly appreciate it
[07:23:15] <johnkpaul> Ortix: ok, if you _really_ want to do this, all you need is change ids to classes
[07:23:21] <johnkpaul> and change your selector to the class
[07:23:23] <johnkpaul> and your code looks fine
[07:24:32] <Ortix> johnkpaul: hey it works~!
[07:24:38] <Ortix> just 1 t hing.. it won't let me unselect it T_T
[07:24:56] <vl1234> @venus......some problem in jquery plugin only........

And also, when I drag them to the right or left side, they become tall rather than wide(300x600)?
[07:46:48] <kevwilde> how can a .height() be 0; if i see it?
[07:47:17] <johnkpaul> kevwilde: are you sure you're not in quirks mode?
[07:47:35] <johnkpaul> also, the height can be 0 but if the overflow is visible, you can see content

[08:26:12] <poppiez> how do you avoid page scrolling when hitting "space"?
[08:29:20] <WebDragon|laptop> poppiez: some browsers have that built-in
[08:29:44] <poppiez> WebDragon|laptop: how do you use it?
[08:30:17] <WebDragon|laptop> opera scrolls a page at a time when you press space (similar to pgdn)
[08:30:29] <WebDragon|laptop> I'm sure other browsers do this similarly
[08:30:39] <WebDragon|laptop> how do you 'use' it I have no idea
[08:30:50] <WebDragon|laptop> other than oh, PRESS THE SPACE BAR.... :)

[09:05:02] <Taggnostr2> johnkpaul, I meant the width, the <p> should appear under the text, but the cell shouldn't get wider (taller is fine though)

[09:10:47] <bartmax> ty johnkpaul
[09:10:52] <johnkpaul> np
[09:10:58] <johnkpaul> hillct: they get along fine
[09:11:18] <hlveheart> My .ajax call is being ignored in IE8, and IE7, but works just fine in IE9.
[09:11:19] <hlveheart> o_O
[09:11:20] <johnkpaul> ^^ @ h1
[09:11:23] <johnkpaul> hlveheart:
[09:11:27] <hemangpatel> is anyone there for my question ?
[09:11:29] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ hlveheart
[09:11:30] <bot-t> hlveheart, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:11:50] <hlveheart> can't really provide you with a working demo because it's ASP
[09:11:51] <hlveheart> lol
[09:12:04] <hlveheart> and it's all in production stages atm
[09:12:24] <dogbrain> hemangpatel, well... start with making a javascript pdf reader :)
[09:12:56] <johnkpaul> then show us the code hlveheart
[09:13:36] <hemangpatel> dogbrain : i dont need reader . i need book reader. turn page something like
[09:14:14] <dogbrain> hemangpatel, to be able to turn a pdf page then you need to be able to read the pdf in javascript..
[09:14:16] <hlveheart> <script>$.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance", cache: false }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").append(html); });</script>
[09:14:37] <hlveheart> ^^
[09:16:20] <catcher> Any strategy suggestions - I've got an element that's hidden to begin with, then overlays itself on top of my content (absolutely positioned) with user activation.  The problem is that some of my pages aren't tall enough to support the new element (and I don't want to set an overall min-height for all pages). Ideas?
[09:19:43] <SystemParadox_> afternoon. jQuery.get is returning 'Object' in Chrome and IE (not even '{}'!), but correctly returns the data in Firefox. Cannot for the life of me figure out why. Can anyone give me any hints what might be wrong? Thanks
[09:20:08] <johnkpaul> hlveheart: there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that from what you showed
[09:20:15] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ SystemParadox_
[09:20:16] <bot-t> SystemParadox_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:21:13] <WebDragon|laptop> http://devel.delpizzoconstruction.com/  the first slide is a video that should open in a lightbox but in IE9.0.8112 it does not -- anyone have a clue why not ?
[09:24:48] <bartmax> is it posible to splice a string ?
[09:24:50] <bartmax> in js
[09:25:04] <bartmax> $ eval "P3444".splice(0,1)
[09:25:16] <bartmax> ? eval "P3444".splice(0,1)
[09:25:17] <bot-t> bartmax: TypeError: "P3444".splice is not a function
[09:25:21] <bartmax> ? eval $("P3444").splice(0,1)
[09:25:22] <bot-t> bartmax: []
[09:25:24] <bartmax> mmmm
[09:25:25] <johnkpaul> bartmax: what are you trying to do? js strings have substr and substring
[09:25:51] <bartmax> trying to split a string into 2 - first character into one and rest into another
[09:25:53] <bartmax> ? substr
[09:25:58] <bot-t> bartmax, bug1737.patch on Ticket #1737  Attachment  jQuery Core - Bug ... - Patch to invoke moveTo() properly from sliderMoveTo() http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/1737/bug1737.patch
[09:26:02] <devOlsen> strange, .trigger('click'); or .click() on an anchor fails to respect target attributes.
[09:26:02] <bartmax> lol
[09:26:19] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn javacript substr @ bartmax
[09:26:20] <bot-t> bartmax, substr - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr
[09:26:27] <bartmax> ty johnkpaul
[09:26:29] <johnkpaul> np
[09:26:44] <johnkpaul> devOlsen: .trigger("click") does not actually click on the link as if a user clicked with a mouse
[09:27:00] <johnkpaul> you have to use document.createEvent for that
[09:27:34] <bartmax> johnkpaul: PERFECT!!!!
[09:27:49] <ndugu> heh
[09:27:56] <WebDragon> damn you IE what the hell
[09:28:12] <WebDragon> this thing even works on android
[09:28:46] <devOlsen> indeed, the anchors are built by server side on pages load, not artificially inserted. Looks like the only way to simulate a target _blank along with a programmatically click on these anchors is to use creepy old window.open.
[09:29:00] <bartmax> lol@webdragon
[09:29:03] <bartmax> brbr
[09:30:54] <johnkpaul> devOlsen: ah I see, you're replacing the functionaity of the browser completely, yes you need window.open
[09:31:41] <WebDragon> http://devel.delpizzoconstruction.com/  soliciting any assistance to help me understand why clicking the first slide does not open the lightbox in IE9 to display the video
[09:31:58] <devOlsen> indeed, trying to delay these from fireing to set off a GA event tracking on them, but some contain target _blank. What sucks is window.open is almost always caught by popup blockers, as well as almost never opens as a new tab.
[09:32:33] <WebDragon> window.open is only caught by popup blockers when it's called without a click triggering the event
[09:32:36] <WebDragon> or mostly only
[09:32:56] <WebDragon> if the user clicked on something and window.open is called, usually it should work, at least TTBOMK
[09:33:29] <devOlsen> indeed, and in my scenario I have to artificially trigger the click events on these links.
[09:34:12] <hariom> I have created any associated array. How to retrieve keys of that associated array?
[09:34:25] <m4xx> zend astounds me, they charge so much for their product and have _terrible_ support ticket response times
[09:34:49] <ndugu> yo. i did this and it worked: http://jsfiddle.net/BUds3/2/. but then i added more images and it didnt: http://chrlie.com/test2.htm. why not?
[09:35:57] <johnkpaul> devOlsen: why do you need to artificially trigger them to send a tracking event?
[09:36:04] <johnkpaul> that's what .click() is for
[09:37:11] <devOlsen> because some contain target blank that wont interrupt the event track from sending, while others do no, and will interrupt the event track from being successfully sent. and yes I'm using the GA async version.
[09:37:39] <Alf__> why my input doesn,t work but textarea work ? http://css-tricks.com/jquery-php-chat/       i want to use input .... can anyone help me
[09:38:48] <johnkpaul> devOlsen: why would it interrupt?
[09:39:58] <devOlsen> when I say interrupted I mean, the track event wont even fire, cause the window has already started to load the next page.
[09:40:21] <johnkpaul> but GA's async tracking fires on beforeunload, no?
[09:40:32] <devOlsen> seems to be not.
[09:41:38] <johnkpaul> devOlsen: hmm, that's really surprising
[09:42:15] <devOlsen> although, what am I thinking! Just do regular track event call on _blank targeted links, cause this wont be interrupted, while I just pause non _blank target links, fire track and then use trigger on these..! Hah had the solution the whole time.
[09:42:23] <devOlsen> duh thanks for listening to me rant guys heh.
[09:46:28] <Alf__> hm?
[09:48:44] <freeed> Hey all.. I've got an html image tag in a javascript string.. how can I use jquery to pull out the src attribute into a seperate variable?
[09:49:13] <skylamer`> just get the src attr from the img tags :)
[09:49:36] <imsky> maaaan what a wednesday
[09:49:36] <bot-t> (11 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky he's a bastard
[09:49:36] <bot-t> (11 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky jk ily
[09:50:08] <Famic> freeed:either use regex or instanciate the img and use .attr()
[09:50:44] <freeed> skylamer`, it's a complte image tag being returned via another script… i.e. var blah = '<img src="blah blah" />'  Was hoping I could somehow turn it into a real dom element and simply use .attr('src') to pull out the srouce
[09:50:48] <freeed> source*
[09:51:06] <shoky_> you can
[09:51:12] <skylamer`> regex . . . :)
[09:51:17] <Famic> freeed: try $(blah).attr(src')
[09:51:21] <shoky_> $(blah).attr('src')
[09:51:36] <freeed> Heh.. it's always too simple :D thanks guys
[09:52:10] <imsky> $(blah).attr("src") @ freeed
[09:52:23] <shoky_> 3 times ice cream
[09:52:24] <Famic> anyone for a fourth ? :)
[09:52:30] <imsky> wish i could connect twice
[09:53:37] <WebDragon> I wish I could figure out why this isn't working on IE9
[09:53:48] <WebDragon> not even any js errors
[09:54:09] <shoky_> what's that
[09:54:37] <WebDragon> shoky_: http://devel.delpizzoconstruction.com/ the first slide should open the youtube video in a fancybox
[09:54:37] <shoky_> o
[09:55:16] <Famic> WebDragon: it works in IE9 here
[09:55:25] <WebDragon> the click event on the window that's not in one of the left/right areas, should drop a console.log of the href
[09:55:30] <WebDragon> it does?
[09:55:38] <WebDragon> tha fsck? O_o
[09:55:55] <Famic> 9.0.8112.16421
[09:56:01] <imsky> i use ie4
[09:56:04] <WebDragon> I can't wait to get my new laptop
[09:56:05] <imsky> am i behind the times?
[09:56:05] <Famic> took a bit of time though
[09:56:25] <Famic> imsky: simpler times :D
[09:56:29] <shoky_> works here too
[09:56:32] <shoky_> @ ie9
[09:56:33] <imsky> bet your ass Famic
[09:56:53] <Famic> I'm just glad IE6 is mostly out of the picture
[09:57:02] <WebDragon> then I can finally install https://github.com/xdissent/ievms
[09:57:45] <imsky> lol at that
[09:57:56] <WebDragon> beats the hell outta IETester
[09:57:58] <imsky> ie6 support is a 1.5x quote multiplier
[09:58:15] <imsky> win xp laptop on ebay = $200
[09:58:21] <johnkpaul> WebDragon: why do you need a new laptop for the ie vms?
[09:58:36] <johnkpaul> that's just the OSX version, those are made from virtual pc images for windows
[09:59:05] <WebDragon> johnkpaul: the new laptop is already on the way -- this way I don't have to upgrade the linux on this laptop to get the current virtualbox-OSE that can run it
[09:59:43] <WebDragon> I haven't upgraded this one in a  bit -- been too damn busy and can't afford to chance any downtime if something goes agley, and don't have a reliable enough linux backup-restore solution that can restore to bare-metal if necessary
[09:59:58] <WebDragon> I had great hopes for Mondo, but it's still not part of Fedora yet :/
[10:00:46] <WebDragon> not just OSX version; linux too
[10:00:58] <WebDragon> @ johnkpaul
[10:01:20] <johnkpaul> yeah, sorry, I should have said a virtualbox version
[10:01:27] <WebDragon> ah
[10:01:41] <WebDragon> yeah that's exactly what I'm looking for
[10:02:04] <WebDragon> I dual-boot the laptop but all the tools I use for webdevel are on the linux side, so I can boot over, test in IE, but can't tweak anything easily
[10:02:19] <WebDragon> the ievms will be a frigging godsend if it works
[10:02:33] <imsky> WebDragon, you know xp sp3 is like $50
[10:02:55] <WebDragon> used to have IEs4Linux back in the day but that developer dropped off the planet, and it was never quite clean enough
[10:03:20] <WebDragon> imsky: I don't need all of windows just to test IE versions with -- and the microsoft vm's work pretty well from what I hear
[10:03:41] <WebDragon> this script converts them to work with virtualbox -- which again, if it works as advertised, it's precisely what I need most
[10:03:46] <imsky> WebDragon, seems it's a way cleaner solution, pop the disc in, install in vbox. rather than dicking around with GB-sized images
[10:04:12] <WebDragon> once installed in vbox it's GB-sized images anyway, so what's the difference ?
[10:04:35] <imsky> my time is so valuable though
[10:04:40] <WebDragon> precisely
[10:04:45] <WebDragon> I can download 'em while I sleep
[10:04:49] <WebDragon> :D
[10:04:53] <imsky> GOOD LUCK BRO
[10:04:58] <WebDragon> THANZK
[10:04:58] <shoky_> `ta
[10:05:00] <WebDragon> hehe
[10:05:28] <WebDragon> new lappy is gonna be much sweeter.. this one's an old T2060 processor (dual core but not a core2duo) -- new one's a core i5
[10:05:36] <imsky> "The VMs provided by Microsoft will not pass the Windows Genuine Advantage and cannot be activated. Unfortunately for us, that means our VMs will lock us out after 30 days of unactivated use. By reverting to the clean snapshot the countdown to the activation apocalypse is reset, effectively allowing your VM to work indefinitely."
[10:05:39] <imsky> ^ oh my lol
[10:05:40] <gho5t> I need help with my styled checkbox. 1) I don't understand why only the first checkbox is styled. 2) Why isn't the click event firing? http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/2/
[10:05:55] <WebDragon> imsky: yeah, brilliant ain't it?
[10:06:03] <imsky> the solution costs $50
[10:06:07] <WebDragon> always clean, no left over cruft getting in the way
[10:06:13] <WebDragon> no cost
[10:06:19] <WebDragon> just reset the vm
[10:06:24] <shoky_> when it comes to OS VMs just for fucken browser testing, i'm a very proud pirate
[10:06:46] <WebDragon> I don't need the whole OS when MS provides a stripped down solution to do exactly what I want and little else
[10:07:04] <imsky> WebDragon, you mean the 699 MB disc with or the VHD monstrosity
[10:07:07] <WebDragon> saves on gigs of storage keeping various VM's of OS's around to support ie 6 7 8 9 10
[10:07:13] <imsky> lol hurr
[10:07:23] <imsky> the lengths some people go to
[10:07:27] <gho5t> just fixed it
[10:07:27] <WebDragon> xp+vista+win7
[10:07:34] <WebDragon> I don't need all that
[10:07:40] <gho5t> i was derping
[10:07:44] <WebDragon> I don't see how this is a greater length, honestly
[10:07:44] <shoky_> screw vista
[10:07:47] <imsky> derp away my brother
[10:07:59] * imsky used vista approximately for 1% of his computing career
[10:08:00] <WebDragon> the vm
[10:08:17] <shoky_> that's a sizable chunk
[10:08:25] <imsky> is it?
[10:08:30] <imsky> i'm rounding up
[10:08:34] <shoky_> unless you started computing a year ago
[10:08:36] <WebDragon> the vm's are smaller, only have IE, are tuned to the specific IE version, and the solutions keeps them clean, you don't need to pay anything, nor deal with 30 day deactivation
[10:08:39] <WebDragon> how is it a problem? :)
[10:09:00] <WebDragon> or too difficult/complicated?
[10:09:42] * WebDragon *scratches his head*
[10:10:07] <shoky_> now mine!
[10:10:09] <WebDragon> anyway, if the slidebar video link to fancybox framed vid works in IE9, then I'm good to go and can proof the client
[10:10:44] <WebDragon> gotta figure out what's wrong with boss's testing computer at some later point :D
[10:10:57] <nights> how does this look?
[10:10:58] <nights> http://www-dev.maishoku.com/en/
[10:10:59] <WebDragon> SNMF (so not my fault)
[10:11:02] <WebDragon> :D
[10:11:10] <eddiemonge> wesbos: sup
[10:11:25] <wesbos> eddiemonge: whoop! I'mmma message you
[10:11:30] <shoky_> nights: sugoi desu yo
[10:11:53] <nights> hehe
[10:11:57] <nights> honto
[10:12:07] <nights> komento ha
[10:12:37] <nevin> Hi
[10:12:56] <shoky_> hontou. shikashi, the 'maishoku' logo is kinda bland
[10:13:24] <WebDragon> nights: http://i49.tinypic.com/96x64k.jpg  and also I get a horizontal scrollbar in Opera 11.64
[10:13:37] <gho5t> Is there a general reason why a handler won't fire when using .live() but will with just a .click()
[10:13:46] <gho5t> $facade.live('click', function () {	alert('yo'); });
[10:14:02] <shoky_> don't use live dude
[10:14:02] <nevin> I have a problem with a slider here, http://baltimoresunmediagroup.com/, when you switch to a new tab in the browser after a couple of minutes and come back to the page the slides are on top of each other...
[10:14:14] <gho5t> shoky_: i'm using 1.5
[10:14:16] <WebDragon> gho5t: .on replaced .live in current jquery
[10:14:22] <shoky_> gho5t: then use delegate
[10:14:45] <WebDragon> nevin: sounds like a css problem actually
[10:15:00] <gho5t> so never use live basically
[10:15:04] <shoky_> yes
[10:15:08] <gho5t> shit dog
[10:15:08] <nights> shoky_: HA... good cus that i will definately get rid off
[10:15:12] <gho5t> i been using that for years
[10:15:15] <WebDragon> http://devel.delpizzoconstruction.com/ I just finished this one up, nevin -- maybe you can cadge a find there
[10:15:23] <shoky_> nights: good ;)
[10:15:24] <nights> shoky_: so the rest is not half bad then?
[10:15:39] <shoky_> nights: nop i like it
[10:15:42] <majuscule> I have a select element referenced by "this". how can I apply the ":selected" option to it?
[10:15:50] <nevin> thanks WebDragon
[10:15:52] <nights> as soon as that designcrowd page refunds us.... they refunded 400 out of 460 bucks.... although they have a 100% money back guarantee
[10:15:56] <WebDragon> nevin: cheers
[10:16:10] <nights> so i can NOT recommend designcrowd = DEVIL IN DISGUISE!
[10:17:12] <gho5t> shoky_: how would i rewrite it using a delegate? it seems to want a selector in the params. $facade.live('click', function () { alert('yo'); });
[10:17:28] <nights> shoky_: thanks vm anyway :)
[10:17:46] <shoky_> dou itashimashite
[10:17:49] <shoky_> i think
[10:18:23] <ndugu> i did this and it worked: http://jsfiddle.net/BUds3/2/. but then i added more images and it didnt: http://chrlie.com/test2.htm. why not?
[10:18:28] <ndugu> the last one is just a test
[10:18:34] <shoky_> gho5t: you delegate the event to some container element. (live does this but it always chooses the 'document' element for you)
[10:18:49] <gho5t> ok yeah i was just about to do $(window).delegate(".checkbox", "click", function() {
[10:18:55] <gho5t> i guess use document instead?
[10:18:57] <thomaslfromz> hello
[10:19:06] <gho5t> yah
[10:19:41] <gho5t> this is not pretty. if i'm doing this in a widget that means every checkbox is going to be creating a new delegate
[10:19:55] <shoky_> ideally you use some container div or something
[10:20:02] <Alf__> why my input doesn,t work but textarea work ? http://css-tricks.com/jquery-php-chat/       i want to use input .... can anyone help me
[10:20:08] <gho5t> yeah i should do that
[10:20:19] <thomaslfromz> my jQuery("*").bind("click", function () { console.log("click");}); works, my jQuery("#footer").bind("click", function () { console.log("click");}); not
[10:20:19] <shoky_> because if you delegate to the window or document, all clicks will get handled
[10:20:36] <gho5t> i see why delegates are better but live should work
[10:20:49] <shoky_> yea i dono why in your case .click() works but .live doesnt
[10:20:57] <shoky_> have to see a demo for that
[10:21:12] <gho5t> yeah i would put it on jsfiddle but it's a widget and a bunch of code
[10:21:17] <gho5t> oh well
[10:21:22] <shoky_> putting it on a jsfiddle
[10:21:27] <shoky_> will force you to isolate the issue
[10:21:35] <shoky_> and then you'll solve it
[10:21:40] <gho5t> all right
[10:21:45] <shoky_> i say go for it
[10:21:59] <ndugu> why doesnt this work when i add more images? http://jsfiddle.net/BUds3/2/
[10:21:59] <gho5t> widgets need jqui right?
[10:22:07] <shoky_> i guess
[10:24:15] <beeviz> whats the easiest way to replace a node with another _without_ losing the content?
[10:24:24] <nights> shoky_> nande nihongo wakaru no
[10:24:35] <beeviz> ... without losing the content and all bound event listeners
[10:24:43] <eddiemonge> beeviz:  why do you want to?
[10:24:46] <jedimind_> replace it with what
[10:25:21] <gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/5/
[10:25:25] <gho5t> why won't my widget work in here
[10:25:39] <shoky_> nights: daigaku de 3-nan benkyou shita
[10:25:40] <beeviz> i have several <a href="#showMenu">show menu</a> links in a (mobile) page. which cause iphone to show the location bar for a short moment
[10:25:51] <shoky_> nights: like 5-6 years ago ;p
[10:25:55] <nights> 3 nen
[10:25:59] <shoky_> nen :)
[10:26:03] <nights> nihongo mou wasuretekita kana?
[10:26:03] <ndugu> why doesnt this work when i add more images? http://jsfiddle.net/BUds3/2/
[10:26:11] <ndugu> in different sizes
[10:26:14] <nights> shoky: nani daigaku de?
[10:26:22] <beeviz> but i cant use <span class="showMenu"></span> instead because i dont have link targets on non javascript devices
[10:26:29] <ndugu> im trying to center them all
[10:26:38] <shoky_> tel-aviv no daigaku de
[10:26:44] <gho5t> shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/7/
[10:26:51] <beeviz> so my intention was to replace all <a> with <span> in case a device supports javascript
[10:26:55] <nights> aa, nihon de benkyou shitenakatta no ka
[10:26:57] <gho5t> if you change live to just a click handler you'll see it will work

[10:27:14] <shoky_> sou
[10:27:41] <shoky_> demo nihon de ryouko shita
[10:27:56] <shoky_> ok poor #jquery
[10:28:34] <eddiemonge> beeviz:  thats not the right solution
[10:29:33] <gho5t> shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/7/
[10:30:06] <eddiemonge> beeviz:  take a look at jquery mobile and how its being done there
[10:30:27] <beeviz> don't they have the same problem?
[10:30:45] <beeviz> i remember times where i get the same effect with jquery mobile
[10:30:49] <beeviz> got
[10:31:02] <beeviz> don't know if they found a working solution yet
[10:31:32] <eddiemonge> they did
[10:31:38] <eddiemonge> awhile back
[10:32:55] <shoky_> gho5t:  this is how you use live: http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/9/
[10:33:41] <gho5t> ah. so i can't wire it up in the widget?
[10:33:59] <gho5t> i was hoping to do that because checkboxes in hidden divs that are later shown are not getting their click handlers
[10:34:00] <shoky_> gho5t: but i'll change it to delegate: http://jsfiddle.net/fWYpM/10/
[10:34:43] <shoky_> if your widget has some container element that you want to delegate clicks to, you can...
[10:34:50] <gho5t> ok
[10:35:05] <gho5t> this is just going back to why i couldn't use llive in the widget though
[10:35:09] <shoky_> but otherwise, calling .live multiple times for the same selector is redundant
[10:35:26] <shoky_> don't use live either way
[10:37:02] <gho5t> ok
[10:37:11] <gho5t> i'll use delegate and wrap this guy in a parent
[10:37:13] <gho5t> thanks
[10:37:19] <shoky_> np
[10:42:33] <thomaslfromz> ps: mach auch noch codeyear.com
[10:42:34] <thomaslfromz> ;-)
[10:44:43] <gho5t> dammit. even with delegate the event won't fire. i have a panel that is hidden and later revealed and it shows the checkbox styles from my widget, but the click handler isn't wiring up.
[10:45:55] <gho5t> i can reinit the widget when the panel is shown but it seems to add my html elements to the page again - even though they're only set to add to the dom in the widget's create method
[10:46:15] <gho5t> when only init should be called again in the widget

[10:54:27] <moijk> Hi. anyone got experience with jsTree? I'm trying to correctly create a node in a tree made out of html_data
[10:55:21] <Lundy> How can I grab the value off a class AFTER I have set it with something?
[10:55:35] <vadi> What is the event which is raised when I click, that is to say when I select-choose, a value from a jquery autocomplete list of an input field?   I know it is not the select event ;-)   Any hint?
[10:55:55] <eddiemonge> Lundy: what do you mena?
[10:56:02] <vadi>       jquery-ui autocomplete list
[10:56:24] <Lundy> Iv changed it with .html and now I want to grab the new value off it, when I select something from a dropdown box
[10:56:47] <nullpointer> why thank you.. allso i am stuck at somthing.. i want to get ahold of info outside of the .documents cookie, as i am creating a browser app wich utulixzes some things you get when logged in to a service, but i hace to get ahold of a value in the other cookie
[10:56:59] <Lundy> $("#margin_percent").change(function(){ 	var margin_value = $(".product_cost_price").val(); alert(margin_value); }); <------- returns NULL
[10:57:04] <nullpointer> anyone know how to do this?
[10:58:28] <eddiemonge> Lundy: what is product_cost_price?
[10:58:35] <bradmaxs> Speaking of jquery-ui autocomplete, I am having a problem with my data src when I updated the function. http://jsfiddle.net/RcKUQ/2/
[10:59:00] <Lundy> eddiemonge: here is the working script..... www.lundy.me.uk
[10:59:17] <Lundy> search for product code 0 (zero) then click on the code
[10:59:51] <Lundy> when you select a new discount margin ...... it should alert the current cost price of what ever product you have selected but it doesnt
[11:01:11] <eddiemonge> Lundy:  product_cost_price isnt an input.
[11:01:35] <gho5t> got it. i guess it was because i was applying the widget to my input and then hiding it, which sort of screwed stuff up

[11:05:07] <Whirl3d> slightly off-topic, but is anyone familiar with how to extract data from mySQL. I need to get the data for a jquery slideshow out of a mysql db and I can get the first row...I am just not sure how to get the rest...
[11:05:34] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: you probably need to loop through the results
[11:06:21] <ZilenceR> Hello folks! I got a problem with having jquery not working over iframes, anyone have a min to help me?
[11:06:23] <Whirl3d> I guess I just need to look up the syntax for the loop. Thanks for the reply, eddiemonge...haven't seen you in a while how are you?
[11:06:45] <Zzaichik> ZilenceR: yikes
[11:07:06] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d:  good. busy. new job
[11:07:18] <ZilenceR> Zzaichik: yikes huh? :P
[11:07:28] <eddiemonge> ZilenceR:  it generally wont work in iframes
[11:08:02] <ZilenceR> eddiemonge: Oh, thats why it doesnt work. Spent several hours trying to figure it out
[11:08:02] <Whirl3d> congrats. It's always good to see you in here.
[11:08:08] <Zzaichik> iframes have their own set of files that they're pulling from
[11:08:29] <ZilenceR> eddiemonge: Several ppl on different forums has told me to use .parent and .getelementbyid
[11:08:54] <ZilenceR> Zzaichik: Yea, because of that there cant be any interaction between the two+
[11:09:16] <Zzaichik> Yeah it makes it "complicated". ;)
[11:10:28] <ZilenceR> Zzaichik: Facebook joke huh :P haha! So basicly what i want to do is having a .slideToggle working with a box, and i want to activate that toggle from the iframe
[11:11:57] <eddiemonge> whats in the iframe?
[11:12:43] <ZilenceR> eddiemonge: Its a js menu atm
[11:13:10] <eddiemonge> ZilenceR:  why is it in an iframe?
[11:13:35] <velcrobots> going to take my first leap into creating an offline-capable mobile web "app" - anyone have any recommendations as to what storage technology to use?  WebSQL?
[11:13:52] <ZilenceR> eddiemonge: Becuase i had some issues with the animation extending outside the cssbox and not being reliable in the box.
[11:14:15] <Zzaichik> oooooooh - rethink your CSS man.
[11:14:34] <ZilenceR> eddiemonge: sometimes the animation came out at top and sometimes at the bottom.
[11:15:39] <mantas322> Hi guys
[11:15:46] <ZilenceR> Zzaichik: Yea, well tbh its not my design :P
[11:15:47] <mantas322> is this channel active? i have some questions
[11:16:15] <xec> ?ask @ mantas322
[11:16:15] <bot-t> mantas322, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:16:29] <Zzaichik> ZilenceR: I'd scrap the iframe idea and rethink the HTML / CSS. There's no reason for an iframe there.  Ahh, well that makes more sense. haha
[11:16:46] <mantas322> so I'm trying to generate multiple Ajax upload buttons
[11:16:51] <ZilenceR> Zzaichik: Ok! Thanks m8 :)
[11:17:09] <Zzaichik> np1
[11:17:54] <mantas322> I guess im struggling to understand how file upload dialog works...
[11:18:04] <mantas322> I'm using this as an example
[11:18:04] <mantas322> http://valums.com/files/2009/ajax-upload/demo-jquery.htm#
[11:18:28] <mantas322> but im really new to jquery.. so I was wondering for "best practices" for somethign like this
[11:18:43] <mantas322> so image a page which could have a dynamic number of file upload buttons
[11:18:46] <mantas322> imagine*
[11:19:16] <nullpointer> um.. why would you want multiple buttons?
[11:19:48] <mantas322> so a person could upload different files to different categories
[11:20:02] <nullpointer> could make sense yes
[11:20:09] <mantas322> laike "case1 [upload]      case2 [upload]  case3[upload]
[11:20:32] <mantas322> however in the example the buttons are hardcoded to their handlers
[11:20:41] <nullpointer> could in some cases be a bit more user-friendly
[11:21:09] <mantas322> so i guess my question is how can I create a dynamic upload button
[11:21:22] <mantas322> and how does uploading files to a website work at all?
[11:21:32] <mantas322> btw i have coldfusion on the backend of this
[11:21:51] <gho5t> haha
[11:21:54] <gho5t> jk
[11:21:58] <gho5t> kinda
[11:21:59] <mantas322> dont laugh
[11:22:01] <mantas322> i know...
[11:22:04] <nullpointer> you can create as many buttons as you will. sayyou iterate over a categories list, you could add a new button for every category
[11:22:12] <mantas322> right right
[11:22:22] <mantas322> but how can I handle that within the event of the button
[11:22:32] <nullpointer> and create a default upload handler, shich takes category as an argument, and creates the dialogue for you
[11:22:44] <mantas322> right....
[11:22:47] <mantas322> hmm
[11:22:55] <mantas322> I guess i need to figure out how to upload a file first
[11:23:01] <mantas322> in cf
[11:23:13] <nullpointer> so when you set handler to the button in each iteration, set the same default handler, with the category
[11:23:17] <delinquentme> hey all I've got a JSON string that I've built up in ruby ... if it responds to .type()   .. as an Array ... does that mean that its incorrectly formatted?
[11:23:48] <shoky_> are you asking about ruby or js
[11:23:57] <delinquentme> shoky_, in js
[11:24:03] <nullpointer> arent json just an array?
[11:24:09] <vadi> What is the event which is raised when I click, that is to say when I select-choose, a value from a jquery-ui autocomplete list of an input field?   I know it is not the select event ;-)   Any hint?
[11:24:19] <delinquentme> console.log( $.type( data['links'] ) )   >> array
[11:24:20] <shoky_> so what do you mean as an array?
[11:24:25] <shoky_> o
[11:24:40] <aphid> nullpointer: it's not called JSAN is it?
[11:25:12] <shoky_> then data['links'] is probably NOT a json string..
[11:25:18] <nullpointer> aphid: what did you just ask me?
[11:25:30] <nullpointer> a json file is essentially an array of values
[11:25:51] <delinquentme> the issue im having is that I need the formatting {source: nodes[3], target: nodes[5]}    but what I've got is {source: "nodes[2]", target: "nodes[0]"},
[11:25:51] <shoky_> whut
[11:26:36] <delinquentme> the 2nd option evals as valid json .. but I need some way to get the values in those KV pairs  as ... " not strings"
[11:26:37] <delinquentme> lol
[11:27:08] <shoky_> what do you mean 'what ive got'
[11:27:12] <delinquentme> so I figured I'd parse them with $.parseJSON( data['links'] )  but this spits at me and says its a null value
[11:27:13] <shoky_> got from where
[11:27:29] <delinquentme> shoky_, from an AJAX call to a ruby generated string
[11:27:48] <shoky_> then ruby is generating 'what ive got' ?
[11:28:02] <shoky_> then you want to change your ruby code?
[11:28:36] <delinquentme> http://pastie.org/3956913
[11:28:48] <delinquentme> is what ruby is generating
[11:28:51] <delinquentme> maybe...
[11:29:19] <delinquentme> but shoky_ if chrome JSON's viewer is evaluating it as well-encoded JSON
[11:29:25] <delinquentme> then it should be valid JSON no?
[11:29:34] <bil_> lets say I had <div class="foo"/> <div class="bar"/> <div class="bar"/>, and i wanted to transverse to div.foo from $(this) on the second div.bar element. I thought .prevUntil('.foo') would work, but it seems to return the first preceeding sibling no matter what selector i use for prevUntil
[11:29:54] <shoky_> delinquentme: its valid JSON, that doesnt mean its the formatting you want
[11:33:29] <bartmax_> can do a find on JS plain object ?
[11:33:35] <arpegius> for a collection of jquery objects ($elements), what's the best way to manipulate the last n objects? specifically, I want to remove the last n elements from the dom.
[11:33:50] <bartmax_> $(plainJSObject).find('name="bart"') ??
[11:33:55] <johnkpaul> ?slice @ arpegius
[11:33:56] <bot-t> arpegius, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[11:34:09] <coldhead> no bartmax_, you have to search it manually
[11:34:22] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn array.prototype.filter @ bartmax_
[11:34:24] <bot-t> bartmax_, Array filter method - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[11:34:32] <arpegius> johnkpaul: perfect. didn't know about slice. thanks.
[11:34:42] <johnkpaul> np, arpegius, have fun
[11:34:52] <bartmax_> johnkpaul: in nested collections, that would became kinda complex right ?
[11:35:15] <johnkpaul> bartmax_: depends on what you mean by nested collection
[11:35:34] <johnkpaul> but yeah, in the case that it's not a simple deep property comparison, you'll need to write your own code to do the search
[11:35:44] <bartmax_> root.Customers().Order().Items().Products() <-- search for a product ...
[11:36:19] <bartmax_> xxx() == array,
[11:37:29] <johnkpaul> bartmax_: jquery doesn't have anything OOTB to help you
[11:37:35] <bartmax_> johnkpaul: ko ?
[11:41:17] <psyolus> Does an expression like var one = two || three || four; just set one equal to the first defined value?
[11:42:01] <bartmax_> psyolus: yes
[11:42:14] <bartmax_> ? eval one = two || three || four
[11:42:16] <bot-t> bartmax_: ReferenceError: two is not defined
[11:42:24] <nail__> to the first true value
[11:42:27] <bartmax_> ? eval one = 2 || 3 || 4

[11:42:38] <bartmax_> ? eval one = false || 3 || 4
[11:42:39] <bot-t> bartmax_: 3
[11:43:05] <bartmax_> ? eval one = { someProp : propValue } || 3 || 4
[11:43:05] <bot-t> bartmax_: ReferenceError: propValue is not defined
[11:43:10] <bartmax_> ? eval one = { someProp : 'propValue' } || 3 || 4
[11:43:11] <bot-t> bartmax_: {"someProp": "propValue"}
[11:43:35] <shoky_> ? eval 0 || false || null || undefined || (1 == 0) || 'bartmax'
[11:43:35] <bot-t> shoky_: "bartmax"
[11:46:00] <hlveheart> Where's capone when you need him
[11:46:01] <hlveheart> :|
[11:46:55] <hlveheart> i cannot figure out why this ajax isn't appending my html in IE7/8, but works just fine in IE9, and Firefox/chrome/etc
[11:46:56] <hlveheart> o_o
[11:46:57] <hlveheart> ...
[11:47:24] <hlveheart> i can't jsfiddle it, because it's asp, and on a webstage pending release
[11:47:28] <hlveheart> i'm going bonkers
[11:47:48] <jedimind> get an ie8/7 inspector and check it out
[11:47:56] <hlveheart> i did, no errors when I tried inspecting
[11:47:57] <jedimind> also are you doing it in native ie7/8 or ie9 in compat mode
[11:48:01] <hlveheart> Compat mode
[11:48:07] <jedimind> use a native/standalone one instead
[11:48:09] <hlveheart> but also tried IE8 non compat mode, on a virtual box
[11:48:10] <jedimind> in a VM
[11:48:12] <hlveheart> and same issue
[11:48:13] <jedimind> ok
[11:48:23] <jedimind> review your code, make sure that you're dilligent with ;
[11:48:32] <jedimind> like EVERYWHERE
[11:48:40] <hlveheart> Thing that's strange is that I can call an alert, and it outputs my html in the alert
[11:48:40] <hlveheart> but
[11:48:42] <jedimind> IE7/8 hates missing semicolons
[11:48:43] <hlveheart> it won't append
[11:48:57] <hlveheart> for example
[11:48:57] <jedimind> thos eare just basic ie7/8 debugs
[11:48:58] <hlveheart> $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").html(html); alert(html); });
[11:49:10] <hlveheart> That displays the HTML in an alert just fine
[11:49:15] <hlveheart> $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").append(html); });
[11:49:21] <hlveheart> Ignores it completely in IE6/7
[11:49:23] <hlveheart> and 8
[11:49:48] <jedimind> try to recreate the problem in a small testcase
[11:49:52] <jedimind> i know its a pain in the ass to isolate it
[11:49:56] <jedimind> but it'll help
[11:52:17] <hlveheart> I bet you it's a broken tag somewhere
[11:52:18] <hlveheart> I bet you
[11:52:18] <hlveheart> ;|
[11:52:33] <hlveheart> but the entire site is in ASP, so it's kinda hard to pinpoint that
[11:52:35] <fission6> if i have a form and a button to submit it, which object should i attach the submit handler too
[11:52:41] <hlveheart> in master page, after master page
[11:52:44] <fission6> right nowits on form and that doesnt seem to stop the submission
[11:53:24] <ravenzz> hlveheart why are you using done() ?
[11:53:29] <fission6> damn just tried button too - that doesn't work either
[11:53:49] <silverwind> ravenzz, what else would you use?
[11:54:21] <ravenzz> the success callback?
[11:54:24] <silverwind> .done/.fail/.always should be used.. the others are deprecated.
[11:55:05] <fission6> is there something special i have to do if i am using multiple forms and doing $(form.comments).submit(return false); cause right now that doesn;t work and th eform still submits
[11:55:21] <ravenzz> $.ajax({ url : '/foo', success : function(data) { /* have fun*/ } })
[11:55:29] <silverwind> fission6, .submit takes a function as parameter, not statements
[11:55:41] <hlveheart> ravenzz: would would done() end up doing?
[11:55:58] <silverwind> ravenzz, it works but it's being deprecated in favor of the promise interface..
[11:56:12] <hlveheart> and how would that work with this code:
[11:56:12] <hlveheart> $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(function (html) { $("#ajaxtickr").append(html); });
[11:56:14] <silverwind> ravenzz, Which is cleaner and more powerful
[11:56:19] <ravenzz> ok
[11:56:20] <ravenzz> np
[11:56:40] <hlveheart> $.ajax({ url: "/tsweb/maintenance" }).done(); ?
[11:56:55] <fission6> silverwind: understood but can the selector for submit() be form.some_class where its bound to many forms?
[11:57:46] <ravenzz> hlveheart try alert($('#ajaxtickr').length)
[11:58:38] <silverwind> fission6, It's not a selector :/
[11:58:40] <ravenzz> or console.log with firebug lite or something
[11:58:56] <silverwind> fission6, myForm.submit(function() { return false; });
[11:59:01] <hlveheart> ravenzz; it's coming back with alert of 1
[11:59:14] <ravenzz> so at least exists :p
[11:59:17] <hlveheart> like I said, in IE9, firefox, chrome, the ajax works just fine
[11:59:21] <fission6> silverwind: i have many forms
[11:59:30] <hlveheart> if I alert it, it'll show the correct html
[11:59:35] <hlveheart> but it's just not appending it
[11:59:36] <hlveheart> lol
[11:59:55] <silverwind> fission6, Also, you want to pass a selector to the $ object(It's a string)
[12:00:05] <fission6> i am
[12:00:10] <fission6> i have many forms
[12:00:23] <fission6> each containing a comment box per post
[12:00:43] <fission6> i want to bind submit to each form and make submission through ajax vs standard POST right now
[12:01:26] <fission6> silverwind: http://jsfiddle.net/4yGnQ/
[12:02:00] <fission6> silverwind: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/4yGnQ/1/
[12:02:01] <silverwind> fission6, looks fine to me
[12:02:10] <fission6> the form still keeps submititng
[12:03:10] <silverwind> fission6, http://jsfiddle.net/4yGnQ/2/
[12:03:12] <fission6> okay i see the issue
[12:03:54] <fission6> silverwind: now to take the form and submit through ajax, i can use serialize right? and then just $.post
[12:04:18] <silverwind> fission6, Totally :)
[12:05:06] <ravenzz> hlveheart try with function (html) { var ajaxtickr = $('#ajaxtickr'); ajaxtickr.html(ajaxtickr.html() + html); }
[12:05:09] <ravenzz> just in case
[12:05:30] <fission6> silverwind: tank you
[12:05:40] <Whirl3d> in order for .ajax data to be valid JSON, is a document header or mimetype required or can php just spit out the JSON data?
[12:06:24] <ravenzz> even though it should work, i mean you can have an html string as parameter
[12:06:37] <thinkt4nk> Whirl3d php can just spit out the JSON data, as long as the response is well-formed
[12:07:02] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5FUVk/21/
[12:07:21] <thinkt4nk> Whirl3d however, application/json is the best mime type for the response
[12:07:34] <Whirl3d> I copied the result of the php script into the comments. Am I missing something else?
[12:08:10] <shoky_> Whirl3d: thats not a JSON object
[12:08:50] <shoky_> (it's like 10)
[12:09:19] <thinkt4nk> Whirl3d you don't have to parse the json if you specified the dataType in the call to ajax
[12:10:06] <thinkt4nk> oh, and as shoky_ pointed out, it's not well-formed json
[12:11:34] <Whirl3d> So, I used php's jSON api to parse the results of a mysql query....where'd I go wrong?
[12:12:14] <shoky_> you need to output one JSON object
[12:12:53] <shoky_> donno php's api
[12:14:12] <mantas322> okay I have a specific quesiton now
[12:14:30] <nono> inquesition?
[12:14:39] <nono> :)
[12:14:55] <shoky_> why i never expected
[12:14:58] <mantas322> I have an AjaxUpload thing
[12:15:09] <mantas322> lemme paste bin this
[12:15:27] <bartmax_> list of strings, how can i do a li ? errors = ["a", "b"]. data-bind="foreach: errors" and how do I do the text binding ?
[12:15:54] <shoky_> $data ?
[12:16:01] <shoky_> wrong channel btw
[12:16:35] <mantas322> http://pastebin.com/rU8XWCev
[12:16:39] <ezio> i'm using autocomplete ... is there any way to tell if the user pressed enter without selecting something in the list?
[12:16:44] <mantas322> ^ okay so im tryign to send in a file name param to my uploadpage
[12:16:50] <mantas322> how can i do this using jquery
[12:16:57] <bartmax_> sorry
[12:17:04] <mantas322> with ext js I could add in params: { filename:file},
[12:17:13] <bartmax_> shoky_: in fact, wrong channel :D
[12:17:22] <shoky_> that's what i said :P ? ?
[12:17:23] <bartmax_> im kinda jumping from jquery / ko and viceversa :D
[12:18:49] <ezio> i'm using autocomplete ... is there any way to tell if the user pressed enter without selecting something in the list?
[12:19:40] <niftylettuce> best way to find a <div> with string inside like <div>Blah</div> ?
[12:19:50] <niftylettuce> :contains? innerHTML?
[12:20:37] <catcher> ezio, just test the val before performing the action, and prevent it from going through if it's null.
[12:20:57] <shoky_> niftylettuce: :contains should be fine
[12:21:03] <hlveheart> ;/
[12:21:07] <hlveheart> This doesn't make any sense
[12:21:18] <shoky_> niftylettuce: but the BEST way is neither
[12:21:25] <ezio> catcher, i want that value
[12:21:36] <niftylettuce> nvm got it
[12:21:39] <hlveheart> What on earth can cause ajax to not append html on only IE8, and IE7, but work just fine on an alert, and will also append the HTML in every single other browser?!~
[12:21:40] <hlveheart> ...
[12:21:48] <niftylettuce> shoky_: yeah I used :contains, but I needed to add [role=button]
[12:22:04] <shoky_> hlveheart: if it alerts fine, then its not ajax that is the problematic fine, is it?
[12:22:09] <kylehayes> What's the best way to disconnect, an array of event handles?
[12:22:10] <shoky_> er fine=one
[12:22:23] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into a table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226 is there any dynamic table that allows me to insert cells anywhere ?
[12:22:37] <hlveheart> so what can the issue be, if it's only effecting IE7, and 8?
[12:22:46] <shoky_> i dont know, fiddle it up
[12:22:55] <hlveheart> i can't, it's asp, and full of master pages
[12:23:03] <shoky_> you can if you really want to
[12:23:11] <shoky_> i didnt say put your whole site in jsfiddle
[12:23:15] <shoky_> isolate the issue
[12:23:18] <shoky_> make a fiddle
[12:23:40] <shoky_> you can mock ajax requests there if you really need to
[12:23:53] <shoky_> (but as we've said it doesn't seem to be the ajax that is problematic)
[12:24:01] <shoky_> if it gets the html and alerts in the right time
[12:24:33] <catcher> ezio, $('#your_input_element).val()
[12:24:42] <ezio> catcher, it will have a value
[12:24:44] <ezio> and rightly so
[12:24:53] <catcher> ezio, just test if it's ''
[12:24:55] <ezio> what if i don't select something from auto complete in google
[12:24:57] <catcher> empty string
[12:25:06] <mantas322> anyone know how to help me with my issue?
[12:25:08] <ezio> catcher, it won't be empty
[12:25:55] <catcher> ezio, you don't want them to be able to search for what they actually typed in?
[12:26:24] <catcher> what if they don't like the autocomplete options?
[12:26:25] <ezio> catcher, i want them to be able to type in something that doesn't necessarily exist in the autocomplete list
[12:27:59] <ezio> catcher, what i did to get around it was put a keypress event on the input and test for enter, it works in everything but ff where it fires two events when they select something from the autocomplete list
[12:28:02] <catcher> ezio, If I'm not misunderstanding, you should have your autocomplete put the results in the same input field. Then you can always just use that for your query.
[12:28:46] <ezio> catcher, i need to know if he or she selected something from the list
[12:32:05] <catcher> ezio, I suppose you could set a flag when they do, and then test for it before sending off your main input's action. You'll have to reset it at the right time though.
[12:32:43] <catcher> Seems more complicated than sharing the input field though.
[12:32:48] <ezio> yeah that's something that should be taken care of in the box
[12:33:07] <ezio> catcher, sharing the input field?
[12:33:15] <Whirl3d> YEAH! I got it to work finally. Thanks shoky, thinkt4nk, ravenzzz
[12:35:07] <catcher> ezio, have your enter keypress on the autocomplete results trigger the submit function on the same form.. then there's only 1 action that can happen, and it won't care if the data was typed or selected from the list.
[12:36:41] <ezio> catcher, you mean both the keypress and the select trigger the submit?
[12:36:53] <ezio> and the submit will only select one?
[12:37:12] <karl_heinz> how can I perform some action if a value "0" is selected from a dropdown menu
[12:38:25] <smplstk> ?change @ karl_heinz
[12:38:25] <bot-t> karl_heinz, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[12:38:28] <karl_heinz> nevermind, found it, thanks
[12:38:35] <smplstk> ...
[12:39:57] <catcher> ezio, the way I've done it in the past is to have 'enter' keypress trigger the submit on the form with the query, but selecting it sets the val of the input.
[12:40:00] <reenignEesreveR> I want to have visual communication between my remote designers and engineers/clients. Is there any annotation/feedback library which I may use to enable point and click paste notes or annotations on visual elements of the HTML site?
[12:40:22] <catcher> ezio, the form's onsubmit handler should only run once.
[12:40:37] <noregret> can anyone take a look at my json please?
[12:40:50] <delinquentme> anyone ever see this before: Error: Problem parsing d="MNaN,NaNLNaN,NaNCNaN,NaN NaN,NaN NaN,NaNLNaN,NaNCNaN,NaN NaN,NaN NaN,NaN"
[12:41:01] <delinquentme> i mean other than directions for nyan cat soup .. its not telling me much
[12:41:04] <ezio> delinquentme, did it go baaaaaaaaaaaaaaatman after?
[12:41:12] <jawhn> lmfao
[12:41:42] <delinquentme> ezio, i'd know what to do then!
[12:41:46] <delinquentme> however that is nit the case
[12:41:52] <catcher> lol
[12:42:11] <hlveheart> shoky_, you still there?
[12:45:59] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into a table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226 is there any dynamic table that allows me to insert cells anywhere ?
[12:51:10] <larzen-wrk2> question.. i need to POST a json object to the server...
[12:51:25] <larzen-wrk2> for whatever reason, my jQuery.post(restPath, requestData, {contentType: 'application/json'}); is not posting json
[12:51:26] <delinquentme> what do i put at the end of an object to get its value?
[12:51:31] <delinquentme> .inspect or something like that?
[12:52:31] <delinquentme> if the object is  {"key":"value"}
[12:52:50] <erichynds> object.name_of_key
[12:55:47] <delinquentme> erichynds, what about if the object is {source: nodes[2], target: nodes[0]}
[12:55:50] <delinquentme> without quotes
[12:56:11] <erichynds> same thing
[12:57:09] <Absolute0> I have a navigation menu with one item slideDown/slideUp when hovered over. If I pass the mouse over the said item a bunch of times, I get the menu slide up and down bunch of times annoyingly. How can I fix this?
[12:57:27] <Brodingo> ?g hover intent @ Absolute0
[12:57:28] <bot-t> Absolute0, hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in - http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[12:57:40] <delinquentme> lulzzz
[12:57:41] <delinquentme> wow
[12:57:42] <delinquentme> ok
[12:57:57] <Absolute0> sweet
[12:58:15] <Brodingo> Absolute0 it has to do with animation queue stacking up
[12:58:32] <Absolute0> yeah, I was trying to hack my way around it -- no luck.
[12:58:45] <jeffsmykil> anyone familiar with brandonaaron's mousewheel plugin?
[12:59:35] <Brodingo> Absolute0 also see http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/01/quick-tip-prevent-animation-queue-buildup
[12:59:40] <jeffsmykil> i feel like it fires twice each time i turn the wheel
[13:00:04] <Brodingo> Absolute0 if found using .stop with .slide and .fade can produce some strange bugs so i use hover intent
[13:00:47] <Brodingo> jeffsmykil ive used it and ive seen varying results with different mice acutally
[13:01:05] <jeffsmykil> Brodingo: is there a better way to do this?
[13:01:10] <Brodingo> i dunno man
[13:01:10] <jeffsmykil> a better plugin maybe?
[13:01:56] <Brodingo> ive only used it in conjunction with jscrollpane and i havent had problems really
[13:02:20] <jeffsmykil> yeah im trying to increase or decrease magnification but like i said i think its firing twice
[13:02:50] <Brodingo> my try to debounce it somehow
[13:02:54] <Brodingo> might try*
[13:03:02] <jedimind> .detach
[13:03:04] <Brodingo> shrugs
[13:03:05] <jedimind> is probably your friend
[13:03:10] <smplstk> noregret: what is this for?
[13:03:30] <noregret> smplstk: what do you mean
[13:03:45] <smplstk> im just curious what you're building.
[13:03:54] <smplstk> *as to*
[13:04:23] <imachuchu> with the jquery-ui autocomplete widget is there a way to pass additional data along with the term (I need to also pass which database to query against)?
[13:04:30] <noregret> smplstk: a tool that tags news
[13:04:51] <noregret> smplstk: and I want to display the json data in teh shown table, any idea ?
[13:05:08] <smplstk> noregret: I take it you have no control over the json structure?
[13:05:22] <noregret> smplstk: i do have control
[13:05:44] <noregret> smplstk: it's the most relevant structure that i could think of
[13:08:30] <coreyman> Hi I have an array like this, {"status":1,"userData":[{"userID":"12","name":"coreyman"}]} there can be multiple userID and name like this {"userID":"12","name":"coreyman"}, {"userID":"12","name":"coreyman"} how can I loop through this using each to get all of the userID and name?
[13:16:49] <jeffsmykil> Brodingo: I fixed it
[13:16:53] <jeffsmykil> its hacky but i fixed it
[13:17:07] <Brodingo> yay!
[13:17:18] <hlveheart> I fixed my issue, too
[13:17:23] <Brodingo> yay!!!!
[13:17:23] <hlveheart> I'm a bit ashamed, though
[13:17:25] <jeffsmykil> i just set a global variable
[13:17:28] <Brodingo> oh
[13:17:34] <Brodingo> i retract my yay
[13:17:37] <Brodingo> no yay for you
[13:17:42] <jeffsmykil> and filtere out every other
[13:17:45] <jeffsmykil> I know I know
[13:18:18] <Brodingo> ya know if youre in a closure you can avoid globals
[13:18:34] <noregret> coreyman: $.each(data.userData, function(i,v){console.log(v.userID,"/",v.name)})
[13:18:54] <jeffsmykil> Im not sure what you mean brodingo
[13:19:10] <niftylettuce> how can I trigger two keycodes down at once? (e.g. var e=$.Event("keydown"); e.which = 17; ) would trigger CTRL, but what about CTRL+S without using ctrlKey=true?
[13:19:12] <coreyman_> noregret ugh im dumb i was trying i.userid and i.name
[13:19:17] <Brodingo> (function (window, document, $, undefined) { // coads here! }(window, document, jQuery));
[13:19:25] <Brodingo> not sure how popular of a practice that is though
[13:20:05] <coreyman_> noregret thank you very much I'm all good now
[13:20:13] <draginx> Is there anyway to see if an element with a z-index of 2 is over an element with a z-index of 1?
[13:20:16] <coreyman_> doesn't help you to think when a kid is sitting right beside you asking 100 questions
[13:20:28] <noregret> coreyman_: yw
[13:21:36] <Brodingo> niftylettuce $.Event() ?
[13:22:17] <noregret> can someone help with transforming that json into a table ? http://www.pastie.org/3955226 is there any dynamic table that allows me to insert cells anywhere ? I can change the json structure, but it's the most relevant structure i could think of

[13:26:22] <niftylettuce> Brodingo: yeah that link doesn't help, I'm not using ctrlKey = true, I want to trigger both keys 17 and 83 at once, asimilar to pressing J and K key at once
[13:26:27] <Brodingo> hmm that seems kinda shitty yeah
[13:26:44] <niftylettuce> im having an interface which has stringfromcharcode event checker
[13:27:18] <niftylettuce> maybe im triggering the event on the wrong selector
[13:27:21] <niftylettuce> hmph
[13:27:58] <niftylettuce> Brodingo: I'm trying to simulate the CTRL+S event in Gmail so I don't have to click Save Draft
[13:29:01] <Whirl3d> noregret, the first thing I would do is convert your dates array into a flat array....right now you have an associative array, leaving us with key values like: 2012-03-24 16:30;:13   which make for terrible variable names
[13:29:41] <noregret> Whirl3d: how would it look lke ?
[13:31:51] <Whirl3d> something like {infractions:[{date:".....", charge:[{chargetype:"carding", chargeid:3000},{chargetype:"dos", chargeid:3002}]
[13:33:25] <noregret> Whirl3d: and how will each chargetype be linked to that xxxx_xxxx id ?
[13:35:06] <smplstk> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/d2dB7/
[13:35:13] <smplstk> that's insanely ugly
[13:36:58] <noregret> smplstk: those 3 tags were an example, there might be more of course, it's a variable :)
[13:37:41] <smplstk> yeah - so instead of that switch case statement, you'd need to check if they're in the set
[13:37:48] <smplstk> atleast that'll give you an idea?
[13:37:55] * smplstk shrugs
[13:38:23] <noregret> smplstk: thanks :)
[13:38:26] <AcademyIntl> Hmm, anyone have any ideas how I'd go about doing .each on two different selectors at once?  ie:  $('.qty').each linked with $('.price').each ?  Totalling items in the invoice creation page of an application.
[13:38:31] <Whirl3d> noregret, I have to ask if you are sure your data is correct.
[13:38:40] <Whirl3d> do you have the same id for multiple charges?
[13:38:47] <Whirl3d> and is member really identified by date
[13:39:09] <Whirl3d> I think it's more like the table you show is the member table (list of infractions by date)
[13:39:11] <smplstk> noregret, Whirl3d, that's what I'm sayin'
[13:39:28] <smplstk> like, that data set is all whacky.
[13:39:32] <Whirl3d> the first column is date, the remaining columns represent charges by id
[13:40:03] <Whirl3d> which would basically indicate that each charge has it's own id. Which is only logical.
[13:40:19] <Whirl3d> smplstk, I gotta give you credit though, you turned it out with what you had.
[13:40:36] <AcademyIntl> Basically I need to do this: http://i.imgur.com/wDUwK.png  the subtotal, tax, total needs to update on the .change of each qty and price; I have the function for that already but I need some way to loop through these items one by one qty and price linked per row.
[13:40:43] <Whirl3d> great job with a difficult (and probably incorrectly formed) data set
[13:41:23] <noregret> Whirl3d: could you provide an example structure ? i did it that way because it is the only data that i need to present
[13:41:43] <Whirl3d> no problem. give me just a second
[13:41:57] <noregret> Whirl3d: each chargetype does have an id
[13:42:05] <noregret> take your time
[13:42:41] <AcademyIntl> Any ideas ?
[13:42:53] <DwarfSmasher> quick, simple question, say  var arr = $('div a'), gets me array of objects, arr[0], will return 1st object as string, is there anyways to select 1st while maintaning it as an object?
[13:43:25] <NoiseEee> DwarfSmasher: arr.eq(0)
[13:43:36] <NoiseEee> [0] is giving you the dom element au natural iirc
[13:44:06] <DwarfSmasher> thank you!
[13:45:17] <AcademyIntl> :(  Nobody has any idea about mine, gah;  I have no idea how I'm supposed to do this unless I do some wonky .each on the actual <tr>s in the table :/
[13:46:34] <Whirl3d> no regret, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZpJpz/
[13:47:13] <Whirl3d> so each "charge" would have three properties:  chargeID (unique), a date, and a type
[13:47:16] * smplstk nods
[13:47:24] <Whirl3d> and infractions would be a simple array of those charges
[13:47:40] <noregret> Whirl3d: there is a missing variable there
[13:47:41] <Whirl3d> and each record would have a single member name and list of infractions
[13:47:47] <Whirl3d> which is?
[13:47:54] <noregret> the xxxx_xxxx id
[13:48:04] <Whirl3d> thats your chargeid
[13:48:04] <noregret> which should have, in this case, several charges
[13:48:19] <noregret> then it can't be unique
[13:48:29] <noregret> since each id, has several chargetypes
[13:48:36] <noregret> note the json structure
[13:48:47] <Whirl3d> I asked about the json structure. It looks like a mistake.
[13:48:54] <Whirl3d> usually charges have unique ids
[13:49:03] <Whirl3d> I work for attorneys and do this kind of shit every day
[13:49:19] <Whirl3d> but in the event that I am wrong, I will show you how to do it with your data.
[13:50:08] <noregret> Whirl3d: it can be a mistake, and i want to fix it based on the criteria (a data is linked to an id which in turn is linked to several tags)
[13:50:18] <noregret> a date *
[13:50:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZpJpz/1/
[13:52:21] <Whirl3d> now, notice the "tags" is missing
[13:52:43] <Whirl3d> that's because the tags is just the chargeDates object charge values
[13:53:29] <smplstk> json apis are hard, man.
[13:53:42] <noregret> Whirl3d: by tags, you mean the xxx_xxx id ?
[13:53:47] <Whirl3d> if you have to keep track of the tags and don't want to calculate that in js, or if you want to keep track of it for verification that your table is building the right columns, you could add it under the infractions object.
[13:54:07] <noregret> Whirl3d: by tags, i mean dos/carding/other
[13:54:09] <Whirl3d> In your original structure, you have a "tags" variable that indicates the column titles by number
[13:54:19] <noregret> ah
[13:54:47] <smplstk> see, this was all the explaining that I was going to avoid
[13:55:05] <noregret> Whirl3d: but still, what about the xxx_xxx id ?
[13:55:06] <Whirl3d> so that could either be added to your stucture or ignored since we can find the tags by parsing through each of the charge dates
[13:55:06] <smplstk> I thought my shitty example would help to illustrate the flaw in the data structure ;D
[13:55:21] <Whirl3d> that's chartgeID
[13:55:32] <Whirl3d> each infraction has a chargeID
[13:55:33] <smplstk> loops n loops n spaghetti
[13:55:55] <noregret> Whirl3d: so infractions should be an array with several chargeids?
[13:56:11] <Whirl3d> is that what my data structure indicates?
[13:56:35] <noregret> Whirl3d: no idea, that's why im asking :P
[13:56:35] <Whirl3d> you would have one infraction with one id and several charges
[13:57:07] <Whirl3d> this is not meant to be rude, but perhaps you need to study javascript objects before you try this
[13:58:11] <noregret> Whirl3d: your structure indicates one infractions object with a chargeid
[13:58:15] <noregret> isn't that right ?
[13:58:31] <Whirl3d> yes
[13:58:45] <Whirl3d> one per date
[13:58:46] <imachuchu_> what is the easiest way of finding which radio button is selected (so name="the_radio_buttons" values="a" and "b")
[13:59:06] <Whirl3d> which is what your original data indicated. You never have more than one id per date-line
[14:00:03] <noregret> Whirl3d: ok, so i should be doing an array of infractions, right ?
[14:00:37] <Whirl3d> gimme just a second to draw some notes on your original data....
[14:00:45] <noregret> alright
[14:06:20] <imachuchu_> nm, $('input[name=radioName]:checked', '#myForm').val() gets it (where radioName is the name of the radio selector, myForm is the name of the form)
[14:07:17] <andreamauri> ciao
[14:07:22] <andreamauri> !list
[14:07:32] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BSuvV/
[14:07:44] <andreamauri> ciao
[14:07:51] <Whirl3d> this shows line by line how your data is logically organized based on your original table.
[14:08:23] <Whirl3d> I bet you will find that you need to fix this structure becuase each date will have several infractions with their own id/type, but we'll see
[14:09:13] <noregret> Whirl3d: i will fix the table, but btw, i didn't write that structure by hand, it is converted from a php array to that :)
[14:09:33] <Whirl3d> sure, but the php array is associative
[14:09:57] <Whirl3d> you need to convert it from the associative array to make it work better for you. You can do that in php
[14:10:06] <noregret> right
[14:10:16] <noregret> thanks, I will check it out
[14:10:42] <Whirl3d> np. Lemme know if you get stuck with the php part. I'm not the best at php, but I can get by I suppose.
[14:11:32] <noregret> will o
[14:11:33] <noregret> do
[14:13:22] <gho5t> when i do $('.foo').focus() shouldn't .foo show the :focus styles?
[14:13:29] <gho5t> if not, how can i can make that happen
[14:13:47] <Whirl3d> gho5t, you can't focus multiple items
[14:14:21] <Whirl3d> but you could add your own class like .focused to css and then $(".foo").addClass("focused");
[14:15:16] <gho5t> ah makes sense
[14:15:18] <gho5t> der
[14:15:19] <gho5t> thanks
[14:15:32] <Whirl3d> then in your css, on the line where you have :focus change it to :focus, .focused
[14:15:44] <Whirl3d> np, gl
[14:17:14] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  Shut up before I love you too death
[14:17:21] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:17:28] <gho5t> how would i remove the class on unfocus
[14:17:35] <StevenCodes> .reove()
[14:17:40] <gho5t> is there a jq event for unfocus
[14:17:42] <StevenCodes> or RemoveClass
[14:17:44] <StevenCodes> idk
[14:17:50] <gho5t> i suppose i should look before asking huh
[14:17:54] <Whirl3d> noregret, I just noticed another discrepency in your data that makes me curuious
[14:17:57] <StevenCodes> probably
[14:17:58] <Whirl3d> .removeClass
[14:18:10] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  +1 knew it
[14:18:18] <Zzaichik> .blur()
[14:18:50] <gho5t> Zzaichik: thanks
[14:18:53] <Zzaichik> yeep
[14:18:57] <Whirl3d> true, blur removes :focus, whereas removeClass("focused") removes the other
[14:19:04] <Zzaichik> I'm glad you knew I was talking to you. haha
[14:19:50] <gho5t> Whirl3d: right but i needed to hook into the event when you leave focus
[14:19:55] <gho5t> so i could remove the class
[14:20:10] <noregret> Whirl3d: which is ?
[14:20:30] <greedo> how could I generate a dynamic object name and then use it?
[14:21:03] <Whirl3d> your date column is really a date/time column. You have several "dates" where there are multiple infractions at different times
[14:21:13] <Zzaichik> .attr('name', 'dynamic-name');
[14:21:17] <Zzaichik> just kidding. don't do that.
[14:21:41] <Whirl3d> noregret, from a symantec stand point, you might want to have "times" be the first column, not dates.
[14:22:00] <noregret> Whirl3d: yeah, i know that. I might discard the time, and combine the dates
[14:22:09] <greedo> so have an object named chart_votes1, etc, so I need to call a different object by name with a for loop
[14:22:26] <greedo> within*
[14:22:28] <shoky_> greedo: if you mean dynamic property names then you can do that with obj['property'] notation
[14:22:35] <Whirl3d> noregret, in which case, you will have multiple infractions per date...changing your structure slightly
[14:22:55] <Whirl3d> right now we have one infraction object per "time" incorrectly identified as per "date"
[14:23:06] <noregret> yeah
[14:23:12] <noregret> will change it accordingly
[14:23:21] <Whirl3d> 8)
[14:23:45] <shoky_> Whirl3d: got .pipe yet?
[14:23:55] <greedo> shoky_: all the object are in window
[14:24:00] <greedo> objects*
[14:24:14] <shoky_> greedo: window['myObjectName'] ?
[14:24:28] <Whirl3d> that is so funny, i have a t-shirt with a crackpipe on it that says got pipe?
[14:24:30] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:24:35] <shoky_> lul
[14:24:43] <shoky_> got crack?
[14:24:50] <shoky_> er
[14:24:57] <raj> why does jquery-ui slider not take an array for setting its values? http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#method-values
[14:25:00] <raj> it asks for an index
[14:25:05] <raj> yo shoky_
[14:25:06] <shoky_> cause youre a raj!!~
[14:25:10] <shoky_> yos
[14:25:10] <raj> wuttup my nuzzle
[14:25:15] <shoky_> just fuzzling
[14:25:29] <shoky_> & h r u
[14:25:42] <raj> cooling mah ninja
[14:25:49] <noregret> Whirl3d: btw, i noticed that after fixing the structure, displaying in a table won't be easy as i can see
[14:26:00] <Whirl3d> so, I am avoiding using .pipe by passing around my deferreds rather than piping them.. It took me forever to realize that it was like "piping" text to file in unix
[14:26:24] <raj> sorry, I just saw Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
[14:26:37] <Whirl3d> noregret, change your parameters and it would be...
[14:26:41] <shoky_> watz dat
[14:26:51] <greedo> shoky_: thanks, that worked perfectly
[14:27:00] <raj> movie making fun of all other ghetto black movies
[14:27:37] <shoky_> np greedo
[14:27:49] <shoky_> heh is it a good one
[14:28:01] <Whirl3d> change infractions to {{infractionType:"dos", dates:[], id:999]}   for example
[14:28:05] <shoky_> raj +1 on your slider question
[14:28:49] <Whirl3d> blacksploitation, ftw. LOL
[14:29:51] <shoky_> oh raj
[14:29:57] <shoky_> you can pass an array
[14:30:03] <shoky_> just not documented
[14:30:11] <raj> yeah, I just realized that
[14:30:12] <bartmax_> $ is
[14:30:22] <bartmax_> ? $.is
[14:30:22] <raj> jquery-ui docs should be on github
[14:30:31] <bartmax_> ? is
[14:30:35] <Whirl3d> headed that way, raj
[14:30:35] <bartmax_> ok ...
[14:30:42] <shoky_> bartmax_:
[14:30:53] <shoky_> ?js $().is
[14:30:58] <vladikoff> ls
[14:31:02] <shoky_> ?eval $().is
[14:31:02] <bartmax_> how can i do a $(this).is(':input textarea') <-- what i mean is if it's an input OR a textarea
[14:31:07] <shoky_> derp
[14:31:16] <bartmax_> is is a the new is in 1.7 :D
[14:31:25] <bartmax_> is is the new is :D
[14:31:25] <shoky_> then i'd expect undefined
[14:31:27] <Whirl3d> .is(":input",":textarea");
[14:31:47] <bartmax_> why is that incosistent with rest of params? :(
[14:31:55] <bartmax_> doesn't work btw
[14:32:04] <anli_> I tried to specify a member variable of the code behind in a an xaml attribute like this foo="{StaticResource theVar}", however, the theVar is not a resource
[14:32:05] <shoky_> .is(':input,textara')
[14:32:09] <Whirl3d> try *:input, *:textarea
[14:32:14] <anli_> So what shall I do?
[14:32:25] <bartmax_> none works
[14:32:41] <Whirl3d> can you do them separately and add them?
[14:32:50] <bartmax_> lets try not :D
[14:32:55] <bartmax_> ? not
[14:32:56] <Whirl3d> .is(":input").add(":textarea").   lol
[14:33:07] <anli_> oops, wrong channel
[14:33:11] <anli_> sorry
[14:33:15] <keith_hyfn> Hi all, so I know you can use the the jquery error() function (http://api.jquery.com/error/) to check if an image cannot be loaded when the event happens, but I was wondering if  anyone knew of a good way for figuring out if a previously loaded image succeeded or not?
[14:33:20] <shoky_> bartmax_:  :input already works for textareas too
[14:33:31] <bartmax_> shoky_: not here... .mmmm let me check again
[14:33:42] <shoky_> ?:index
[14:33:55] <keith_hyfn> (assuming that the image was being loaded in an HTML img tag)
[14:35:20] <raj> shoky_, followup question, what if I want the array to be [1,1] so that both handles are on the same node?
[14:35:27] <raj> it seems to bug out
[14:35:41] <bartmax_> shoky_: mmm werid, nothing seems to work
[14:35:48] <shoky_> hmm raj works for me
[14:36:09] <shoky_> bartmax_: .is(':input') ?
[14:36:56] <Whirl3d> bartmax, what do you get when you do them separately. Perhaps one of your markup tags is malformed
[14:36:57] <shoky_> works for me
[14:38:45] <bartmax_>     $(document).on('keydown', ':not(:input)', function() {
[14:38:45] <bartmax_>         $('input:first').focus();
[14:38:45] <bartmax_>     });
[14:38:59] <bartmax_> when typing in a textarea, it do the focus anyway
[14:40:40] <Whirl3d> can you do the selector like that? .not is a method, not a selector, right?
[14:40:55] <Whirl3d> isn't the selector :not(":input")
[14:41:05] <Whirl3d> nvm
[14:41:24] <Whirl3d> my monitor is too big. I misread...srry
[14:42:31] <bartmax_> weird
[14:42:37] <bartmax_> can't make it work
[14:42:49] <bartmax_> even with :not(textarea) or :not(:textarea)
[14:42:55] <shoky_> maybe the keydown event is being sent to other elements..
[14:43:15] <bartmax_> :input -> Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements.
[14:43:17] <bartmax_> weird
[14:43:24] <bartmax_> BUG!! jquery!! BUGG!!
[14:43:26] <bartmax_> :D
[14:43:37] <bartmax_> where's ajpiano when i found bugs ?
[14:43:38] <rroelofs> bartmax_: :input is supposed to select all form elements
[14:43:47] <shoky_> what, who said it's a bug, relax
[14:43:53] <bartmax_> ok
[14:43:54] <bartmax_> :D
[14:44:02] <bartmax_> it would be my 2nd
[14:44:03] <bartmax_> :D
[14:44:05] <rroelofs> "input" selects all elements <input>
[14:44:13] <shoky_> my guess is the event is being sent to something else
[14:44:23] <shoky_> log 'this' in your console inside the handler
[14:45:19] <shoky_> of course this would all be much easier if you fiddled it
[14:47:14] <shoky_> probably <body> or something
[14:49:11] <shoky_> yep: http://jsfiddle.net/RpsJq/
[14:49:17] <shoky_> <body> and <html>
[14:49:34] <shoky_> they are :not(:input) indeed
[14:49:53] <shoky_> no bug plz.
[14:50:27] <rroelofs> :-)
[14:52:52] <bartmax_> ok, got it working : http://jsfiddle.net/m45hs/
[14:53:02] <bartmax_> thank you shoky_
[14:53:12] <bartmax_> i expected keydown will trigger the current element either way.
[14:53:17] <bartmax_> not the body/html
[14:53:22] <bartmax_> but, i think i can live with it
[14:53:23] <bartmax_> :)
[14:53:45] <raj> shoky_, figured it out, the change method of the slider was getting set off from setting it, and creating a neverending loop
[14:55:01] <shoky_> raj: sounds derpy ;p
[14:55:10] <raj> indeed
[14:56:52] <MacroMan> http://pastebin.com/dHwjcCb3 Is the variable 'left' not available inside the $.each loop?
[14:58:15] <andrewhl> I'm using the following jquery on a page. It works properly in Chrome, but in Firefox it just crashes the browser outright. Any idea why?
[14:58:16] <andrewhl> https://gist.github.com/2778091
[14:58:33] <andrewhl> I'm not even sure how to debug this, since just scrolling the page in firefox causes it to crash
[15:00:51] <MacroMan> Anyone know the answer to my question above? Do local variables have scope once I've moved inside an $.each loop?
[15:01:13] <MacroMan> I'm having some trouble getting it working.
[15:01:39] <Flanagan> hi :-) i have this http://pastebin.com/JQm8h6ij and i want that some field are NOT checked is it possible to set up something not to be checked?
[15:01:40] <shoky_> MacroMan: it should be available
[15:02:40] <MacroMan> shoky_: That's what I thought, but when I alert it, it shows undefined. I didn't really want to make it global just for this. Do you know a way around it?
[15:03:39] <shoky_> maybe it's undefined ;P
[15:04:00] <shoky_> make a jsfiddle of the issue and i'll try to help
[15:04:55] <noregret> Whirl3d: would that be right http://www.pastie.org/3957936 ? in php ie
[15:05:26] <ngharo> When handling an event, is there anyway to tell if said event already has went through a handler?
[15:05:46] <MacroMan> shoky_: I've made it global and changed the name to something unique as a work around. But thanks all the same
[15:06:41] <shoky_> making it global should definitely not be neccesary
[15:06:59] <shoky_> nor wise probably
[15:08:50] <shoky_> MacroMan: http://jsfiddle.net/vWdtH/
[15:10:11] <MacroMan> shoky_: Hmm. Odd. Mine seems to be working now it's global. This script is getting too long and I'm too tired.
[15:10:45] <shoky_> why would you make it global if it's a function argument :\
[15:14:41] <prefixed> can someone explain the point of the parenthesis at the beginning of this string as well as the $ inside the method signature? (function ($) {
[15:15:10] <shoky_> the parenthesis at the beginning has to do with the parenthesis at the end
[15:15:23] <Ziber> When reading JSON data from a PHP script, what header should I set?
[15:15:33] <Ziber> s/reading/writing s/from/in
[15:15:41] <tw2113> gah shoky_ made me snicker
[15:15:42] <prefixed> shoky_ is that just a jquery snytax thing?
[15:15:45] <tw2113> *runs away in shame*
[15:15:48] <shoky_> and the $ is just a parameter for this anonymous function, most likely set to jQuery
[15:16:28] <shoky_> prefixed: ( function () { ... } )();
[15:16:39] <prefixed> yes
[15:16:53] <shoky_> that is an anonymous function, invoked immediately (the () at the end is the invokation)
[15:17:04] <shoky_> so that solves the parens question
[15:17:17] <prefixed> ok
[15:17:18] <prefixed> makes sense
[15:17:20] <prefixed> thanks
[15:17:40] <shoky_> then:  ( function ($) { ... use $ and know that it is jQuery ... } )( jQuery );
[15:18:26] <shoky_> that's for making sure you can use $ and that some other evil script didn't set it to something else, or maybe jQuery.noConflict was called, or whatever
[15:18:50] <shoky_> it immediately invokes the anonymous function, passing jQuery as argument
[15:19:12] <shoky_> tw2113 there is no shame in that!
[15:19:53] <shoky_> er i said invokation
[15:19:58] <Ziber> application/json?
[15:21:01] <shoky_> yeah
[15:24:56] <Juch__> anyone here?
[15:25:58] <tw2113> 855 bots Juch__
[15:26:06] <tw2113> yes, you included
[15:27:32] <keith_hyfn> can the 'error' Javascript event (http://api.jquery.com/error/) be delegated in a way such as this? $(".container").on('error','img.errorable-images',function(){});
[15:33:55] <Dr-Bombay> keith: what a strange question, you could just try it
[15:39:54] <Ziber> Using simple jquery/ajax, what's the best way to make it work in IE?
[15:40:24] <tman> has anyone had any luck being able to remove the play icon from flowplayer (plugin)
[15:57:02] <meph15t0> hey there
[15:57:25] <meph15t0> one question please..
[15:58:36] <meph15t0> in this function jQuery(this).bind('DOMSubtreeModified',function(e){...}) hot to get the element modified inside the function? please
[16:00:48] <Whirl3d> noregret, sorry. I was afk. What does your source material look like?
[16:02:30] <noregret> Whirl3d: nevermind, i fixed the array
[16:02:53] <noregret> Whirl3d: http://pastie.org/3958131
[16:03:59] <noregret> that should be correct i guess
[16:04:06] <Whirl3d> noregret, that looks much more reasonable.
[16:04:24] <Whirl3d> now can you parse that into a table format? or did you still need help with it?
[16:05:39] <noregret> Whirl3d: i can parse it, but not sure how would i go with the <th> being the tags...
[16:07:06] <noregret> Whirl3d: e.g. http://pastie.org/3958239
[16:07:22] <shinobi_one> easy question, i have an html anchor inside an html list item, when i click on the anchor i want to get the html list item element, using the anchors id and doing $('#anchorid').parent or .parentElement do not work
[16:08:18] <meph15t0> how to get the element modified using the event DOMSubtreeModified? please
[16:13:31] <shinobi_one> nevermind i'm an idiot who needs sleep
[16:15:54] <shoky_> meph15t0: like any other event.  .on()
[16:18:53] <k1ng> by the way what is wrong with jquery 1.7.2?
[16:19:11] <k1ng> its give error randomly
[16:19:27] <k1ng> even jquery was loaded but jQuery is not found blah blah blah
[16:19:49] <rohanrhu> do i must use kendoui?
[16:20:26] <ccmonster> d
[16:24:02] <suedoh> Anyone well versed with jQuery Mobile?
[16:24:46] <vladikoff> suedoh, ask away
[16:25:08] <suedoh> Sure, I don't mean to ask in both channels, as I've already asked in #jquerymobile, but it's very quiet there
[16:25:17] <suedoh> So I'll ask here as well, and I hope I don't get into trouble :)
[16:25:22] <suedoh> I'm trying to get the whole jquery package that is in the CDN on my local disk since I use a https site.  For some reason the default zip package on the website doesn't include the default theme's and image files for all the icons that the CDN version includes.  Is there a way to get the whole CDN package?  Thanks!
[16:27:44] <vladikoff> suedoh, have you checked http://www.asp.net/ajaxLibrary/CDN.ashx#jQuery_Mobile_Releases_on_the_CDN_3
[16:28:18] <suedoh> no I haven't, since it's not on the jquerymobile site itself
[16:28:27] <meph15t0> <shoky_> thank you. What i wanted was to detect in a tree what element has changed, the problem using .on() would be an exaustive task.
[16:28:31] <suedoh> feels weird to follow asp.net and not jquerymobile.com, you know
[16:28:37] <suedoh> but i'll check it out, thanks
[16:32:19] <vladikoff> suedoh, sorry, it's the official Microsoft CDN
[16:32:57] <vladikoff> suedoh, for example this page http://www.asp.net/ajaxLibrary/CDNjQueryMobile110.ashx has all the image assets it seems, hopefully that's what you are looking for :)
[16:33:25] <suedoh> Yea, definitely
[16:33:33] <suedoh> Thanks, let me get a test on this
[16:33:41] <suedoh> :)
[16:34:02] <Whirl3d> uggg. I think I found another perfect use case for pipe but the docs are so weirdly written....
[16:36:07] <Whirl3d> is it my imagination, or is .pipe simply a way of distributing .then to multiple handlers? in other words. Deferred.pipe=function (succ, fail) {this.then(succ, fail); return (this);}
[16:36:40] <Whirl3d> err,, sorry, return this.promise()
[16:39:47] <noregret> Whirl3d: i should pass another array with all the tags to simplify the table creation, right ?
[16:40:47] <Whirl3d> I don't think so. Just add a conditional statement that, when running through your tags array, if a new tag value exists, add a column
[16:42:06] <noregret> Whirl3d: ok thanks
[16:42:07] <Whirl3d> noregret, a lot of this depends on how the data is originally stored.
[16:42:38] <noregret> Whirl3d: what do you mean.. I have the json with the data..
[16:42:53] <Whirl3d> but you are creating the JSON data from....
[16:43:13] <noregret> Whirl3d: i don't think the original source as long there is a valid outcome
[16:43:25] <Whirl3d> mysql lookup, maybe
[16:43:43] <Whirl3d> sure, but depending on how the original data is setup, you could set your JSON data up better
[16:44:34] <Dave_Stein> aside from the data format in DB, your server can sometimes more easily set it up for a format you'd want to send to a client
[16:44:42] <Dave_Stein> ie PHP reformatting it before sending it down
[16:44:49] <Whirl3d> in fact, depending on how your original data is setup, if ou are having to do a lot of work in php to get it to the format you need in jquery (via JSON), then you could just return the table straight from PHP in html format.
[16:44:59] <Whirl3d> lol what he said
[16:45:14] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:45:21] <noregret> ok thanks guys
[16:45:25] <Dave_Stein> i missed the start of the convo, just saw from the array bit on
[16:45:40] <Whirl3d> you were right on the money, sir.
[16:47:07] <Dave_Stein> i live in JSON transporting ha
[16:47:24] <Whirl3d> so in the Deferred.pipe examples, it is not clear why you would use .pipe and not just two or more .then
[16:49:23] <Whirl3d> which basically makes .pipe redundant since: Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Since deferred.then returns the deferred object, other methods of the deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional .then() methods. F
[16:50:11] <Dave_Stein> well isn't it that pipe returns the manipulated data to your .then
[16:50:21] <Dave_Stein> but if you chain .then it won't passed manipualted data to second
[16:50:25] <Dave_Stein> unless i guess you're storing it yourself elsewhere?
[16:51:20] <Whirl3d> OH....that's the secret.
[16:51:54] <Dave_Stein> i haven't used it yet really just asked my coworker that ive seen use it once or twice :)
[16:53:04] <Whirl3d> so, .pipe is .then with benefits.
[16:53:26] <Dave_Stein> indeed
[16:53:36] <Whirl3d> I keep passing deferreds around instead of callbacks
[16:54:30] <Dave_Stein> i think you'd still do that
[16:54:43] <Whirl3d> so, for my animate functions, for example, I pass the optional deferred like $(element).animatetoo(css, action, defr)
[16:54:45] <Dave_Stein> unless you only want to run the filtered function
[16:55:56] <Whirl3d> what happens if you try to reject a resolved defer or the other way around?
[16:56:21] <Dave_Stein> you can't reject a resolved defer
[16:56:42] <Whirl3d> so it fails with an error, or it just ignores it?
[16:56:49] <Dave_Stein> and rejecting will never fire done
[16:56:57] <Dave_Stein> just the fail c
[16:57:00] <Dave_Stein> so youd need a bind to that
[16:57:13] <Dave_Stein> its silent
[16:57:17] <Dave_Stein> unless you use fail to the defered
[16:57:19] <Dave_Stein> as far as i know
[16:57:24] <Whirl3d> so, doesn't it seem like deferred are a temporary kludge for a pub//sub system
[16:58:14] <Dave_Stein> yeah but one where you have to pass around the object containing the listening
[16:58:23] <Dave_Stein> like you cant just blindly bind and trigger
[16:58:28] <Dave_Stein> you need to pass around the object to a function
[16:58:36] <Dave_Stein> and then have the function do something when object resolves/fails
[16:58:43] <shoky_> what? .pipe is nothing like .then
[16:58:59] <shoky_> .then is just a shortcut for .done()/.error()
[16:59:14] <Dave_Stein> but pipe passes the changed data to those guys
[16:59:16] <shoky_> .pipe can create a NEW promise
[16:59:39] <shoky_> yes but that's not all it does
[16:59:43] <Dave_Stein> yeah its not correct to say its like .then...but you'd use it with then on the new promise for the manipulated data
[16:59:45] <Whirl3d> but when one chained promise resolves, they all do
[16:59:59] <Dave_Stein> .pipe doesnt chain the new promise does it?
[17:00:20] <shoky_> you'd use .then if thats what you need.. you could just as well use .done
[17:00:22] <shoky_> and .error
[17:01:15] <Whirl3d> but the only time you'd use .pipe is if you needed to pass data along with .then
[17:01:39] <Whirl3d> if you didn't need to pass any data, use .then
[17:01:43] <Dave_Stein> but wait... the new promise doesnt chain to the original one, does it?
[17:01:48] <shoky_> the magic of .pipe happens only when you give it a function that returns a deferred/promise
[17:02:04] <shoky_> otherwise it's just a shortcut like .then, yes
[17:02:12] <shoky_> or a shortcut + filter, whatever
[17:02:16] <Whirl3d> which, I'd like to point out, isn't clear by the docs...
[17:02:17] <Dave_Stein> hmm
[17:02:23] <Dave_Stein> the doc doesn't show the callbacks returning promisesb
[17:02:29] <Dave_Stein> but it does say that a new promise is created
[17:02:31] <shoky_> it does
[17:02:51] <shoky_> request.pipe(function( data ) { return $.ajax( url2, { data: { user: data.userId } } ); });
[17:02:54] <Dave_Stein> filtered = defer.pipe(function() { return x } )
[17:03:11] <Dave_Stein> ah i was looking at first example
[17:03:19] <Dave_Stein> so basically it only chains if you make it chain by returning an ew promise within function
[17:03:23] <shoky_> first 2 examples are just for filtering
[17:03:35] <shoky_> not much magic there
[17:03:50] <Dave_Stein> right right
[17:03:55] <Whirl3d> in fact, not much different from .then there
[17:04:18] <Dave_Stein> if you dont return a new promise from the callback
[17:04:30] <Dave_Stein> dfered.pipe will still return a promise
[17:04:34] <Dave_Stein> is it the original one, or a new one?
[17:04:38] <Dave_Stein> new correct?
[17:04:57] <Whirl3d> so, if I return a new promise from .then() in my handler, it's .pipe? equivalent?
[17:05:22] <shoky_> return it where?
[17:05:22] <Dave_Stein> i dont think so cause i dont think anyone is listening for the return in that case
[17:05:32] <Dave_Stein> if you return a new prmose within the then callback
[17:05:39] <Whirl3d> got ya
[17:05:41] <shoky_> then how will you access it
[17:05:46] <Whirl3d> I see.
[17:05:47] <Dave_Stein> right that's what i was saying
[17:05:50] <Dave_Stein> pipe is how youd access it
[17:05:51] <shoky_> hence .pipe
[17:05:52] <Dave_Stein> in then you cant
[17:06:15] <Dave_Stein> but im still not 100% on what filtered equals in that first example... the original or a new promise?
[17:06:33] <Whirl3d> the original, I thought
[17:06:54] <Dave_Stein> "The deferred.pipe() method returns a new promise" so it's new i thought
[17:06:59] <Dave_Stein> i was just double checkin :)
[17:07:14] <Dave_Stein> cause the chain is on top of the new promise i believe
[17:07:18] <Dave_Stein> not the original
[17:07:20] <Whirl3d> but what does that mean> When could it ever reject when the original was .done
[17:07:20] <shoky_> it's always a new promise,
[17:07:30] <shoky_> but unless you return a promise as in the 3rd example,
[17:07:48] <shoky_> then the new promise will already be resolved
[17:07:56] <shoky_> so it's as if its the old promise
[17:07:58] <Dave_Stein> @ajpiano hey guy - decide on gotham yet?
[17:07:58] <shoky_> i think,.
[17:08:08] <Whirl3d> the presumption of a new promise would indicate that it could resolve differently than the original. Ortherwise it's the original promise
[17:08:38] <shoky_> it's a new promise
[17:08:41] <Whirl3d> in the third example, it's a new promise
[17:08:42] <shoky_> because if you call .done() on the old one
[17:08:49] <Dave_Stein> it won't do anything to the new one
[17:08:50] <shoky_> you'll get the original value and not the filtered one
[17:09:13] <Whirl3d> ok I 'm closee....let me get that sinked in...
[17:09:59] <shoky_> ;p
[17:10:20] <Dave_Stein> i think it's clearer when you'll have an actual use case for it
[17:10:44] <Dave_Stein> it's a bitch from the docs alone :)
[17:10:51] <shoky_> aye
[17:11:03] <Dave_Stein> programmers speak english? that's unpossible! :D
[17:11:11] <shoky_> i liked johnkpaul's example in his vimeo vid
[17:11:26] <shoky_> did you watch that Whirl3d ?
[17:12:14] <Whirl3d> Okay, so I could create two functions that returned different color values....one if the deferred fails on if it resolves. Then pipe the original deferred to those functions to get my new color..
[17:13:06] <Whirl3d> shoky,..I did. But I am afraid that I was in too much of a hurry to let it sink in at the time. Now I think I will understand it better. I think I bookmarked it.
[17:13:38] <shoky_> not sure why you'd need pipe in your colors example
[17:15:49] <Whirl3d> so I could say var color=defer.pipe(function () {return "red"}, function () {return "blue:}); and the value for color would only change when the deferred was resolved or rejected.
[17:16:13] <Whirl3d> otherwise, I would need the context of "color" in the handlers for reject and fail
[17:18:06] <Whirl3d> http://vimeo.com/40793064
[17:19:21] <shoky_> no, remember, pipe returns a promise
[17:23:28] <shoky_> if you wanted to change the color based on resolve/reject you'd just do  defer.then(function() { color='red'; }, function() { color='blue'; })
[17:25:00] <Whirl3d> I guess .pipe is just outside of the scope of what I will ever understand. I have yet to figure out where .pipe is different than .then
[17:25:55] <raj> shoky_, can I just do $('#size_slider').unbind('change') ?
[17:26:01] <raj> cuz it doesn't seem to be working
[17:26:21] <raj> it's still running the change function
[17:26:35] <raj> that was defined in the plugin's initialization
[17:26:52] <shoky_> .then just assigns done/fail callbacks.   pipe has 2 main uses: filtering the arguments like in the first 2 examples,  or chaining of async tasks so they happen one after the other, and .pipe returns the promise for the whole ordeal
[17:27:18] <raj> oh, promises, i gotta learn what that means one day
[17:28:04] <Whirl3d> shoky, if you look at this: it's johnkpauls' original fiddle with .then instead of .pipe .....same result
[17:28:11] <phragg> Anyone ever work with jquery TokenInput: http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[17:28:15] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tcJrh/1/
[17:28:30] <phragg> I'm having issues sending the item through a form.
[17:28:38] <phragg> cause I have it as a $_POST previously
[17:29:27] <Dr-Bombay> phragg: do you have a jsfiddle example ready
[17:29:42] <shoky_> raj : it's  'slidechange'
[17:30:52] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul's original fiddle from the vimeo example:http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/tcjrh/
[17:32:17] <shoky_> Whirl3d: umm
[17:32:18] <shoky_> sec
[17:33:14] <shoky_> in this example he's not doing the filtering right
[17:33:35] <ndugu> fiddling is cool
[17:33:37] <shoky_> well
[17:33:37] <Whirl3d> I just copied the fiddle url from his video
[17:33:40] <shoky_> i know
[17:34:44] <Whirl3d> shoky_ I really appreciate your patience, btw. I'm not trying to be difficult and I keep thinking that I am just about to get it all and then....blunted again.
[17:35:40] <Dr-Bombay> phragg: do you have a jsfiddle example ready
[17:36:35] <shoky_> Whirl3d: np
[17:36:41] <Dr-Bombay> another ask & run
[17:37:24] <Whirl3d> i' m gonna setup a fiddle so you can tell me if .pipe would help or not. brb.
[17:37:28] <shoky_> Whirl3d: in his example, if you use .then instead of pipe,
[17:37:51] <shoky_> then the other ajax requests are called at the same time
[17:38:09] <shoky_> Whirl3d: check out http://jsfiddle.net/tcJrh/3/
[17:38:21] <shoky_> all i did was add a delay of 2 seconds to each ajax request
[17:38:42] <shoky_> if you use pipe, you only get the alert after all requests have processed, one after the other
[17:39:00] <shoky_> with then, only the first request needs to finish
[17:39:54] <shoky_> and nothing happens on the success of the following requests, because you dont access the returned promises
[17:40:02] <shoky_> dont/cant
[17:41:59] <raj> is there something I can put in a function to figure out what function called it
[17:42:01] <Whirl3d> changed it to .hten and got same results
[17:42:05] <raj> ?
[17:42:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tcJrh/4/
[17:45:17] <shoky_> i'll look at it,
[17:45:20] <shoky_> but look at: http://jsfiddle.net/tcJrh/7/
[17:45:27] <shoky_> change that to .then and see the difference
[17:46:24] <StevenCodes> Whirl3d,  If I may ask what's the point of this script ?
[17:46:36] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tcJrh/9/
[17:46:53] <Whirl3d> I think I am starting to get it....slowly
[17:47:23] <shoky_> raj:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller
[17:47:25] <Whirl3d> in my latest post, the first alert happens, then 2 seconds, then the second, then 2 seconds, then the third.
[17:47:37] <StevenCodes> oh ok
[17:47:58] <Whirl3d> whereas with .then it happens like first, second, then two seconds, third
[17:48:36] <beefman> how do i use a selector on the contents of a variable?  i am using $.get(<file>, function(data){   ...    };) and want to only grab a div with certain id from data
[17:48:36] <Ziber> using $.ajax(), how can I POST a variable with no value? $.ajax({ url: "blah.php", data: { blah: }).success(function() { //do stuff }); ?
[17:48:50] <shoky_> Whirl3d: well you changed the whole thing when adding the success callbacks..
[17:48:52] <Ziber> im missing a type: "post" there, but you get the point.
[17:49:04] <shoky_> Whirl3d: dont mix deferred stuff with non-deferred , thats fugly ;p
[17:49:20] <shoky_> Whirl3d: look at my example, its simpler
[17:49:35] <shoky_> and no alerts :P
[17:50:43] <luchenbill> I have built a nested accordion using jquery ui and it's a nested ul/li's for a navigation... the functionality is fine however i'm trying to figure out a way to keep the active accordion tab open while navigating to a different page any suggestions?
[17:53:04] <Whirl3d> shoky, .pipe will be the backbone of my animation engine, I can tell now. It makes a lot more sense now, thank you.
[17:53:23] <Whirl3d> we should let johnkpaul know to update his example to avoid alert
[17:53:28] <shoky_> :)
[17:54:34] <Whirl3d> gosh, you would not believe the mess I have been putting myself through to get the equivalent of .pipe to work . LOL
[17:55:00] <shoky_> lol
[17:55:40] <Whirl3d> I was passing around deferred's like acid at a rave...they were everywhere and only some of them worked right
[17:55:52] <beefman> nm that -- i just realized i could specify context in the selector itself
[17:55:59] <beefman> $('#myid', data)
[17:56:05] <Ziber> setTimeOut(20000, function() { // do stuff }); will call it every 20 seconds, right?
[17:56:18] <Whirl3d> setInterval
[17:56:27] <Whirl3d> setTimeOut will do it once
[17:56:31] <Ziber> Oh, thanks
[17:56:59] <shoky_> lol@acid analogy
[17:57:02] <Whirl3d> Ziber, just make sure to clearInterval at some point.
[17:58:49] <HarryPitfall> also, the parameters are inversed
[17:58:50] <Ziber> Well, I'm trying to figure out the best way to do a live feed of sorts.
[17:59:00] <HarryPitfall> first the closure/eval, then the time
[17:59:11] <HarryPitfall> AFAIK
[17:59:45] <HarryPitfall> I prefer to call setTimeout() again inside the closure, instead use of setInterval()
[17:59:49] <Ziber> HarryPitfall: Yes, you were right, thanks.
[18:00:11] <Ziber> How do you mean?
[18:00:13] <HarryPitfall> this way, if something goes really wrong, the loop will stop
[18:00:25] <Whirl3d> amen! Testify!
[18:01:03] <HarryPitfall> setTimeOut(yourFunction, 20000); function yourFunction() { doTheStuff; setTimeOut(yourFunction, 20000); }
[18:01:19] <Ziber> Ahh, okay.
[18:01:20] <Ziber> Gotcha.
[18:01:24] <HarryPitfall> if doTheStuff; generated a exception, the loop will stop
[18:01:34] <shoky_> setTimeout :P
[18:01:37] <luchenbill> here is an example of what i'm trying to do :| http://jsfiddle.net/LqU2c/1/
[18:02:50] <shoky_> that is one weird accordion
[18:03:50] <luchenbill> :| I couldn't really find a good way to do nested accordion navigation's
[18:04:05] <luchenbill> it seems there is not much out there about them
[18:04:08] <shoky_> you're supposed to call .tabs() on a div
[18:04:13] <shoky_> not on the tabs <ul>
[18:04:33] <shoky_> wtf
[18:04:36] <shoky_> sorry
[18:04:41] <shoky_> disregard me :(
[18:04:55] <shoky_> i went from accordion to tabs
[18:05:00] <shoky_> for some reason
[18:05:28] <shoky_> but yeah, point still applies
[18:05:41] <luchenbill> I followed an example I found on stack overflow
[18:06:12] <luchenbill> the accordion seems to be functioning just fine, it's just the fact that when I get to another page, the accordion closes up and I can't keep the place
[18:06:23] <shoky_> i dont see it functioning fine..
[18:06:38] <luchenbill> so for instance if you go vehicle Repair -> brakes
[18:06:46] <luchenbill> that's the 3rd level
[18:06:57] <luchenbill> but if I click sub link in there, when the page reloads it's collapsed
[18:08:06] <shoky_> uhm it doesnt reload
[18:08:27] <luchenbill> uhm that's because it's a jsfiddle, not a live example I guess i'll just put my stuff on a server
[18:09:05] <shoky_> anyway not sure what you're after
[18:09:11] <shoky_> if the page is reloaded
[18:09:16] <shoky_> then its reloaded
[18:09:26] <shoky_> then it should behave as if........... its reloaded
[18:10:03] <luchenbill> I guess you're missing the POINT
[18:10:11] <luchenbill> one second i'll give a better example :)
[18:10:39] <need_jquery_help> Hello
[18:10:45] <shoky_> lol.
[18:11:04] <need_jquery_help> ;)
[18:11:46] <StevenCodes> need_jquery_help,  +1 that's hilarious
[18:11:59] <luchenbill> need_jquery_help++
[18:12:17] <need_jquery_help> nice nice :)))
[18:12:21] <Dr-Bombay> oh no you just angered the jslint gods
[18:12:27] <prefixed> wtf does this mean? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'next'
[18:12:39] <Dr-Bombay>  better replace that with += 1 which is identical in every way
[18:12:47] <shoky_> that you're calling .next() on a DOM element instead of a jquery object
[18:12:51] <prefixed> i am setting a variable next to this.next()
[18:12:59] <shoky_> then you want $(this).next()
[18:13:05] <prefixed> hm
[18:13:06] <prefixed> ok
[18:13:32] <prefixed> next doesn't find the next matching DOM element?
[18:13:41] <prefixed> it only finds the next matching object?
[18:13:56] <shoky_> it does what the docs say pretty much, not sure what you mean
[18:14:26] <need_jquery_help> I'm using jquery 1.4.4. The actual problem that I have I can not access to selected option attribute called "foo". The drop down loaded via ajax, and when user changed selected value I need "foo" attribute value. Currently firebug shows $(this).attr("foo") is undefined
[18:14:36] <shoky_> if you call .next()  without params it'll get the next sibling dom element
[18:14:47] <shoky_> if there is one
[18:15:24] <prefixed> shoky I'm asking more along the line of whether if it does a straight match for the next DOM sibling or not
[18:15:47] <shoky_> i dont understand what you mean by that
[18:16:13] <shoky_> it doesn't have to do with the selector anymore
[18:16:17] <luchenbill> okay this is a quick and dirty example of exactly what I need... I have this accordion located here -> http://www.modernwebpro.com/acc/ if you only use the link Vehicle Maintaince & Repair => Brakes => Heat & Brake Fade you will see you are 3 levels down when you click the link, the page reloads and the accordion is collapsed, I need to track what level was open so I can re-open the accordion upon the new page load... i'm just hav
[18:16:58] <prefixed> shoky I'm pretty sure I understand what you mean, but I am asking for a clarification. As I understand it, next() and prev() only work on objects
[18:17:00] <prefixed> correct?
[18:17:12] <shoky_> they work on jquery objects yah
[18:17:23] <prefixed> ok
[18:17:24] * need_jquery_help 
[18:17:26] <prefixed> I can dig that
[18:18:06] <need_jquery_help> shoky_: could you help me  ? :(
[18:18:17] <luchenbill> sup need_jquery_help please do ask or create a jsfiddle
[18:19:01] <shoky_> luchenbill: if you're loading a new page , then you need to somehow pass data from one page to another. either with GET/POST params, or with cookies, or whatever
[18:19:55] <shoky_> and then you need your new page to do something with that data, like open an accordion
[18:20:32] <shoky_> need_jquery_help: where are you calling $(this).attr("foo")
[18:21:09] <luchenbill> right well I was thinking I could add a hash to the a like blah.html#fooblah so when the new page opened, I could loop through the list looking for the hash that was in the url and do it like that... hoever if you view the source you will see I fail
[18:21:56] <need_jquery_help> shoky_: $(".dropdown_selector").bind('change', function(){ $(this).attr('foo') });
[18:21:59] <Lucky--> Can I retrieve the user's ip address/query string parameters via javascript? If I can, I can get rid of all php
[18:22:02] <Lucky--> js or jquery
[18:22:17] <shoky_> need_jquery_help: foo attribute is on the <select> ?
[18:22:46] <need_jquery_help> shoky_: foo attribute is on options if <select>
[18:22:50] <need_jquery_help> shoky_: foo attribute is on options of <select>
[18:23:05] <shoky_> need_jquery_help: then that's one problem
[18:23:39] <need_jquery_help> shoky_:  bind ?
[18:23:54] <luchenbill> how would I do it with php => get/post, and wtf a cookie?
[18:23:59] <shoky_> i guess you want  $(':selected', this).attr('foo')
[18:24:20] <shoky_> a cookie is one way..
[18:24:57] <need_jquery_help> shoky_:  let me check will it work
[18:25:06] <Lucky--> http://www.jsonip.com/
[18:25:23] <shoky_> ?
[18:25:39] <luchenbill> huh?
[18:28:51] <ale__> Guys, there are sometimes that I want to save a textarea, and something like this is saved "jQuery171017176257037398523_1337788270691"}
[18:29:07] <ale__> But it's randomly, sometimes happens, others not..why could it be?
[18:32:02] <prefixed> what is the correct way to find/change a div within a jquery object?
[18:32:25] <shoky_> ask a better question please
[18:33:30] <luchenbill> fml I wish I could get this
[18:33:36] <Dr-Bombay> which div do you want to change what jquery object are you starting with
[18:33:41] <luchenbill> >_<
[18:34:21] <prefixed> I am starting with jquery object this, and I would like to change the div inside of it with class "trackname"
[18:34:32] <shoky_> you find with find
[18:35:04] <need_jquery_help> shoky_: Thank you very much, works !!!
[18:35:11] <shoky_> y a y z
[18:35:20] <prefixed> yes, but how do I make sure that I do not find all of the "trackname" classes on the page?
[18:35:34] <shoky_> this.find('.trackname')
[18:36:42] <prefixed> ok, so would this allow me to modify the text of jp-title? var $test = (this.find('.jp-title')).text('The text has changed');
[18:37:11] <shoky_> sure.. no need for the extra parens
[18:37:22] <shoky_> .find(..).text(..) is fine
[18:37:42] <prefixed> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'find'
[18:37:57] <shoky_> i guess 'this' is not a jquery object as you said
[18:38:02] <StevenCodes> yeah
[18:38:03] <shoky_> maybe you want $(this)
[18:38:05] <StevenCodes> definetely not
[18:38:41] <StevenCodes>  prefixed  is $(this) a class or ID
[18:38:54] <shoky_> wat
[18:38:56] <prefixed> I'll tell you in a moment
[18:40:00] <prefixed> ok
[18:40:04] <Dr-Bombay> how do you keep a chatter in suspense?
[18:40:22] <prefixed> so the following isn't actually changing the text: var $test = $(this).find('.jp-title').text('The text has changed');
[18:40:53] <shoky_> so go debug it
[18:41:01] <prefixed> that's what I'm doing
[18:41:07] <shoky_> goody
[18:41:10] <StevenCodes> prefixed,  I'm not certain but is $test supposed to have a $ ?
[18:41:16] <prefixed> I dislike your attitude
[18:41:18] <shoky_> what does that matter
[18:41:28] <Dr-Bombay> steven: no but that doesn't keep php programmers from putting one there anyway
[18:41:40] <StevenCodes> Dr-Bombay,  Gotcha
[18:42:07] <shoky_> prefixed: you want a step by step recipe for how to debug that line?>
[18:42:09] <Dr-Bombay> admittedly there are broader reasons to do it
[18:42:14] <shoky_> some people..
[18:42:20] <Dr-Bombay> as a form of hungarian notation
[18:42:26] <prefixed> shoky gotta learn somewhere
[18:42:43] <shoky_> prefixed: check if .find even finds anything
[18:42:45] <Dr-Bombay> I guess you need to look at $(this).find('.jp-title').length to see whether the element was found
[18:44:31] <prefixed> Dr-Bombay how would one go about printing length?
[18:44:46] <Dr-Bombay> prefix: oh come on
[18:45:02] <prefixed> I'm really new to this
[18:45:02] <shoky_> :D
[18:45:35] <StevenCodes> prefixed,  $(this).length()
[18:45:35] <shoky_> prefixed: go watch http://fixingthesejquery.com/   now
[18:46:10] <shoky_> and learn some javascript :/
[18:46:29] <shoky_> .length, not .length()
[18:51:06] <prefixed> hm
[18:51:08] <prefixed> length is 1
[18:51:20] <prefixed> tha'ts incorrect
[18:51:22] <StevenCodes> shoky,  My bad :p
[18:53:01] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:53:03] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[18:53:28] <prefixed> will .find look at an object's children?
[18:53:44] <lenswipe> prefixed, yes it will
[18:53:50] <prefixed> well then wtf
[18:53:52] <lenswipe> prefixed, and their children and their children and their children etc
[18:54:13] <lenswipe> $('p').find('.hello');
[18:54:24] <lenswipe> that will find EVERY child of <p> no matter how deep with the class "hello"
[18:55:08] <prefixed> ok, so let's say I need to find a class named .jp-title in a div several levels down from an object named this
[18:55:19] <lenswipe> okay
[18:55:37] <Dr-Bombay> prefixed: I thought you said you needed to change a div. so you have one div
[18:55:57] <prefixed> so I'm doing this: var $test = $(this).find('.jp-title').text('The text has changed');
[18:56:26] <lenswipe> prefixed, what browser are you using?
[18:56:45] <prefixed> I think that code should find the text indie of .jp-title and change it to "the text has changed"
[18:56:47] <prefixed> chrome
[18:56:57] <lenswipe> prefixed, do you know how to use web inspector?
[18:57:03] <prefixed> yeah, I'm using it now
[18:57:06] <lenswipe> right
[18:57:07] <Dr-Bombay> why did you say length 1 was incorrect?
[18:57:29] <lenswipe> console.log($(this).find('.jp-title')); <---Put that in your JS and look at web inspector
[18:57:36] <lenswipe> look at the "Console" tab
[18:57:42] <lenswipe> prefixed, ^
[18:57:44] <prefixed> Dr-Bombay I thought it returned the number of chars
[18:57:50] <prefixed> so it is actually correct
[18:57:53] <prefixed> *was
[18:57:59] <Sasha_> hi all, i need some help with jquery deferred objects, does anyone know much about these
[18:58:19] <shoky_> Sasha_: just ask
[18:58:37] <prefixed> lenswipe it looks like I am finding it
[18:58:47] <shoky_> prefixed: what type of element is it
[18:58:48] <Sasha_> ok, so
[18:58:49] <lenswipe> prefixed, so try replacing .text(0 with .html()
[18:59:12] <lenswipe> prefixed, if that doesn't work try .val()
[18:59:24] <Carlitta87> i have two divs with content, one of them is set to display none...i would like to be able to hover over the visible one and then the hidden one will appear...but only wen its hovering.... can anyone help me with that?
[18:59:40] <Sasha_> i have this ajax call $.ajax ( ... ), and the success function of the call can detect an error (it checks whether the returned json field 'status' is nonzero)
[18:59:47] <shoky_> Carlitta87: that's what .hover(...) is for
[18:59:56] <Sasha_> e.g. success(json) { if json.status != 0 throw some kind of error }
[19:00:03] <Sasha_> i was wondering what kind of error i can throw, so that a call like
[19:00:10] <Sasha_> $.when ( my ajax call ).done(...)
[19:00:12] <Sasha_> will not fire
[19:00:26] <Sasha_> ie, how do i throw an error that will prevent a .done call
[19:00:33] <Sasha_> from within the success function
[19:00:39] <shoky_> umm
[19:00:54] <systemfault> Sasha_: It would probably work if you used HTTP properly.. no?
[19:01:00] <systemfault> (Just saying)
[19:01:04] <Sasha_> what do you mean?
[19:01:20] <shoky_> why not:  $.ajax(...).done( function(json) { if (json.status != 0) return; ..... } )
[19:01:23] <systemfault> Sasha_: With HTTP, you can decide between success and failures with status codes
[19:01:41] <Dr-Bombay> you want the success function to prevent itself from being called?
[19:01:52] <Sasha_> no, i want the success function to be called, so i can get the returned json
[19:01:57] <shoky_> he means to use an HTTP error code i think..
[19:02:04] <shoky_> oops i was scrolled up
[19:02:10] <systemfault> shoky: Oui monsieur.
[19:02:18] <Sasha_> i understand what youre saying, systemfault, but its a 3rd-party API that uses json and a 200 status code no matter what
[19:02:27] <systemfault> Sasha_: Ah :/ Sad
[19:02:32] <Sasha_> *nods*
[19:02:48] <Sasha_> so i need the success function to be called, so i can check json.status
[19:02:48] <shoky_> Sasha_:  why do you need to throw any error
[19:02:54] <shoky_> then what's the problem?
[19:02:56] <Sasha_> but i dont want $.when( ... ).done to be called
[19:03:05] <shoky_> but that IS the success function
[19:03:20] <shoky_> oh $.when
[19:03:21] <shoky_> hmm
[19:03:23] <systemfault> shoky: He wants the .fail of $.when to be called
[19:03:27] <Sasha_> the success function im talking about is the one specified in $.ajax ( { success: } )
[19:03:31] <Sasha_> thats right
[19:03:38] <Sasha_> well, not necessarily .fail, even just .complete will be fine
[19:03:45] <Sasha_> just not .done
[19:03:50] <systemfault> perhaps you could create a function that returns a promise
[19:03:57] <Sasha_> a promise?
[19:04:25] <Sasha_> hmm ok
[19:04:29] <Carlitta87> shoky_: thats what i did but its not working
[19:04:30] <systemfault> Sasha_: Yeah… $.when/.done/.fail are all part of the jquery "promise/deferred" infrastructure
[19:04:39] <Sasha_> yes hmm i can see that
[19:05:03] <Sasha_> ok thanks, i will look into that and let you know :)
[19:05:09] <systemfault> Sasha_: So, if you write a function that wraps the ajax call, you will be able to do what you want
[19:05:26] <systemfault> ok :D
[19:06:46] <shoky_> Sasha_: $.ajax(...).pipe( function(data) { var dfd = $.Deferred(); data.status == 0 ? dfd.resolve(data) : dfd.reject(data); return dfd; } )
[19:06:48] <shoky_> i think.
[19:07:43] <shoky_> but that's a really odd way of just saying   if (data.status != 0) {  do whatever }   in your original success handler.................
[19:07:45] <systemfault> shoky: Nice if you can do that
[19:08:13] <systemfault> shoky: Didn't know you could simply return a promise from the pipe function
[19:08:28] <shoky_> that's what its good for
[19:08:39] <Carlitta87> shoky_ : this is wat im trying to do.. http://jsfiddle.net/5eMEp/
[19:10:27] <Carlitta87> shoky_: sry made an update , http://jsfiddle.net/5eMEp/2/
[19:11:51] <prefixed> lenswipe how can I make sure that the class in question is found through the console?
[19:12:10] <shoky_> Carlitta87: you had a typo : http://jsfiddle.net/5eMEp/3/
[19:12:12] <lenswipe> it should show you what it finds
[19:12:18] <lenswipe> can someone help me with long polling?
[19:12:22] <lenswipe> im getting duplicates
[19:12:49] <defaultro> hey guys, kinda confused. Would like to know how I should call this for click function  <div class=" form-button submit-login"><input class="button" type="submit"></div>
[19:13:23] <defaultro> like this -      $("input.button").click(function(e) { }
[19:13:42] <shoky_> that should work
[19:14:08] <prefixed> lenswipe I set a breakpoint at the line in question, but I am not seeing *where* it should show me what it found
[19:14:09] <defaultro> yeah, looks like it worked
[19:15:33] <defaultro> it worked :D my cookie code also worked! :D
[19:15:47] <shoky_> that's confusing indeed!
[19:15:49] <defaultro> i've spent almost 4 hours troubleshooing the code
[19:15:52] <Dr-Bombay> lenswipe: sounds indecent
[19:16:01] <lenswipe> Dr-Bombay, ?
[19:16:11] <lenswipe> nevermind
[19:16:15] <lenswipe> im tired its late im going to bed
[19:16:30] <lenswipe> prefixed, it shows you in the console
[19:16:35] <lenswipe> click on "Object > "
[19:16:44] <lenswipe> if you dont see that its not finding anything
[19:16:56] <lenswipe> best of luck im off to bed
[19:18:03] <methods> how come the selectors doesn't list :nth() but that works fine from testing ?
[19:19:00] <defaultro> for the cookie plugin, if I want only few hours, what value should we put? Looks like the default unit is days
[19:20:18] <Sasha_> if i need to use HTTP status codes to invoke an error, which is the best error code to use?
[19:20:36] <shoky_> methods: i found this in the :nth-child comments:
[19:20:37] <shoky_> It does the exact same thing as the :eq selector: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selec.... We don't document :nth, because we want people to use :eq so we can eventually phase out :nth.
[19:20:46] <Carlitta87> shoky... im trying this effect on a gallery of items but its not working :/ ...
[19:20:48] <Carlitta87> http://demo.devmediastudios.com/cbjamaica/nmcms.php?snippet=properties&p=propsearch
[19:21:15] <methods> lol not nice!
[19:21:40] <shoky_> Carlitta87: maybe you stil have typos?
[19:21:47] <methods> thanks
[19:21:56] <Carlitta87> ill check again
[19:22:33] <shoky_> Carlitta87 as you can see it does work...
[19:22:41] <shoky_> (in the fiddle)
[19:23:59] <shoky_> oh
[19:24:01] <shoky_> Carlitta87:   $(this).$(".highlight").fadeOut("slow");
[19:24:27] <shoky_> that is wrong
[19:24:32] <shoky_> check your console..
[19:25:32] <Carlitta87> but i dont want all of them to come up
[19:25:37] <shoky_> Carlitta87: $(this).find('.highlight').fadeOut('slow')
[19:25:43] <Carlitta87> oooh
[19:25:48] <Carlitta87> thank u...
[19:25:48] <shoky_> you cant do $().$() ...
[19:25:50] <shoky_> np
[19:25:51] <Carlitta87> really appreciate it
[19:27:16] <Carlitta87> shoky_: it does this push thing effect
[19:27:17] <Carlitta87> mmm
[19:27:44] <shoky_> Carlitta87: the divs are not on top of each other probably
[19:27:52] <shoky_> i mean, not one behind the other
[19:27:57] <shoky_> they need to be
[19:28:06] <shoky_> in the same place..
[19:28:25] <shoky_> or maybe you do want them not in the same place?
[19:28:59] <shoky_> then you would need to just animate opacity instead of fading out because fadeOut() sets display:none after the fadeout
[19:29:12] <Carlitta87> yeh...i wud like a genreal smooth effect...no jumping
[19:29:13] <shoky_> anyway. goodnight
[19:29:25] <Carlitta87> oooh
[19:29:26] <Carlitta87> ok
[19:56:49] <prefixed> can someone explain why my code on the following page (jplayer.js) is not appending an "active" class to the player element when the play button is clicked? http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[20:01:16] <prefixed> anyone? I'm kinda roadblocked until I understand why this isn't working
[20:01:39] <k1ng> prefixed,
[20:01:39] <k1ng> http://puu.sh/ws07
[20:02:30] <k1ng> <script src="/js/jquery.marquee.js"></script> < not found
[20:03:00] <prefixed> k1ng that's not actually relevant to the problem at hand. I am having an issue with jplayer.js
[20:03:29] <k1ng> i thought this channel is for jQuery
[20:04:40] <prefixed> this is jquery
[20:06:55] <MrTeera> Are there anyone knows how to make a progress bar before finish loading entire page like icloud.com or others?
[20:07:05] <MrTeera> I really don't know the keywords to search Google.
[20:12:12] <raj> shoky_, unbind('slidechange') isn't working
[20:12:14] <raj> it's still bound
[20:20:38] <draginx> Anyone know of a plugin or something that can take multiple square shapes and try to fit them together as best as they can in a canvas/main square?
[20:21:10] <LukeNukem_> hai pplz
[20:21:16] <raj> hai
[20:21:38] <LukeNukem_> man this child selector is really a bummer :<
[20:22:08] <raj> anyone familiar with jquery-ui's slider plugin? i can't seem to unbind the change event
[20:23:21] <Cork> raj: how did you add the listner?
[20:23:50] <Cork> inline when you initialized the slider?
[20:23:53] <raj> in an object to $('#myslider').slider({change: function...})
[20:23:55] <raj> yes
[20:24:06] <Cork> those arn't normal event listners
[20:24:09] <Cork> its callback functions
[20:24:16] <raj> oh
[20:24:32] <raj> damnit, I've been troubleshooting this for like 5hrs
[20:24:41] <raj> so that can't be unbound?
[20:24:49] <Cork> btw did you prefix your event unbinding?
[20:25:14] <raj> prefix?
[20:25:17] <raj> with the selector?
[20:25:19] <raj> yes
[20:25:29] <Cork> ya, all ui events is prefixed with the element name
[20:25:30] <raj> oh, you mean 'slidechange' ?
[20:25:33] <Cork> yes
[20:25:36] <raj> yep
[20:26:13] <Cork> haven't tried this since 1.4, but back then you couldn't unbind the callback functions
[20:26:47] <Cork> so change $('#myslider').slider({change: function() {}}) to $('#myslider').slider().bind('sliderchange' , function() {})
[20:27:03] <raj> k
[20:27:14] <Cork> then you should be able to do $('#myslider').unbind('sliderchange')
[20:30:07] <raj> Cork, yes, that worked
[20:30:22] <raj> i can't believe I've been trying to troubleshoot for this long
[20:30:30] <Cork> :)
[20:31:14] <Cork> when i started using jquery ui i read through how its widgetfactory works
[20:31:35] <Cork> that helps
[20:32:31] <raj> still have that link by any chance? :)
[20:32:37] <raj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[20:32:49] <Cork> for what?
[20:32:59] <raj> reading up on how the widgetfactories work
[20:33:13] <papelboyl> Hi. I have several checkboxes on my form with the ID for them all starting with "tags". I have this $("[id^=tags]").click(function() to check if any of the checkbox was ticked. How do I find out which specific checkbox was ticked? thank you :)
[20:33:14] <Cork> heh, i read the source code
[20:33:21] <raj> i probably would have known that it adds .data() to the element it initialized on
[20:33:26] <raj> oh, you would
[20:33:28] <raj> :)
[20:33:46] <Cork> i created by first jquery-ui plugin almost the same day i started using jquery ui
[20:33:55] <Cork> i need to extend dialog a lot
[20:34:24] <Cork> papelboyl: $(this)
[20:34:26] <raj> what?? you created the dialog plugin?
[20:34:30] <Cork> no
[20:34:34] <Cork> i extended it
[20:34:42] <papelboyl> heh. didn't thought of that! thank you very much :)
[20:35:18] <raj> cool, what'd you make it do?
[20:35:35] <cockatrice> Hi, I'm having a very basic problem I can't figure out.
[20:35:39] <cockatrice> http://braxtonspence.com/
[20:35:49] <cockatrice> My script is at http://braxtonspence.com/scripts/main.js
[20:35:57] <cockatrice> It doesn't alert after I click it.
[20:36:11] <jqueery> How can I return the json from a $.getJSON call?
[20:36:25] <Cork> jqueery: a callback
[20:36:42] <Cork> jqueery: or deferred
[20:36:49] <jqueery> Cork: deferred?
[20:36:54] <Cork> ?.deferred
[20:36:55] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".deferred" in jQuery Docs.
[20:37:03] <Cork> O_o
[20:37:24] <papelboyl> Is there a attribute for names on checkboxes? I tried alert($this).attr(name)); and it's displaying undefined. thanks again
[20:37:33] <Cork> ah right its callback something now days
[20:37:50] <Cork> ?.Callbacks @ jqueery
[20:37:51] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".Callbacks" in jQuery Docs.
[20:37:56] * Cork hits bot-t 
[20:38:06] <jqueery> Thx
[20:38:09] <Cork> jqueery: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[20:38:19] <Cork> jqueery: you can't ever really return the value though
[20:38:37] <Cork> just define functions that you can call
[20:39:16] <Cork> the reason for that is that $.getJSON and all other ajax calls are async, so your function ends before the response comes back
[20:39:43] <Cork> ?.ready @ cockatrice
[20:39:44] <bot-t> cockatrice, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[20:39:50] <cockatrice> Ooooh.
[20:39:54] <cockatrice> Of course.
[20:39:59] <cockatrice> Thanks!
[20:43:22] <papelboyl> thank you very much cork. -thumbs up-
[20:43:35] <Cork> heh, np
[20:59:37] <cockatrice> Okay, Cork. Clearly you are magic. Perhaps you can help me once more.
[20:59:52] <cockatrice> The website is http://braxtonspence.com/
[20:59:55] <opie-x> can someone take a peek at this in ie9 and tell me if i'm doing something strange, notice it doesn't repaint until you click the screen when switching between the options

[21:00:28] <cockatrice> If you click on the pen, it's supposed to load the content and it should look like it does when you first load the page.
[21:00:49] <Cork> cockatrice: please ask your questions first, instead of last
[21:00:55] <cockatrice> I'm sorry.
[21:01:03] <Cork> np
[21:01:11] <Cork> it just makes it simpler to answer
[21:01:38] <cockatrice> I probably can't ask you to look through this and tell me what's wrong anyway, you've probably got other things to do than sift through that
[21:01:42] <cockatrice> I mean, it's rather short
[21:01:54] <cockatrice> The things that are wrong:
[21:02:12] <cockatrice> When you click on the pen, the words "Braxton Spence" are on the left and unformatted
[21:02:18] <Cork> cockatrice: <a href="/#aboutme""> <-- html errors
[21:02:24] <cockatrice> Oh whoops
[21:02:44] <LukeNukem_> sup Cork
[21:02:48] <cockatrice> Thanks for that.
[21:02:58] <cockatrice> But the stuff is still incorrectly formatted when it loads.
[21:03:26] <Cork> cockatrice: and you need to move the line 11-15 into the success callback
[21:04:10] <Cork> LukeNukem_: life goes on
[21:04:22] <cockatrice> Thanks. I appreciate you helping me so much!
[21:06:14] <Cork> opie-x: its cause your using change
[21:06:27] <Cork> opie-x: different browsers triggers it a bit different
[21:06:32] <Cork> it does it on blur
[21:06:38] <Cork> it==ie
[21:07:44] <cockatrice> Does it have something to do with the return value of indexOf()?
[21:07:52] <cockatrice> I think that has to be it.
[21:08:09] <Cork> no
[21:08:15] <Cork> your missing the async values
[21:08:23] <Cork> you can't do it the way your doing it
[21:08:27] <cockatrice> Me?
[21:08:33] <cockatrice> Or opie-x?
[21:08:48] <Cork> ah sorry you've moved it :)
[21:08:55] <Cork> ok, let me test again
[21:09:04] <cockatrice> I'm about to change it once more
[21:09:09] <cockatrice> It just adds a little alert thing
[21:09:12] <cockatrice> debugging
[21:09:35] <cockatrice> Yeah, there we go.
[21:09:45] <cockatrice> data.indexOf('\n\n') is returning =1
[21:09:48] <cockatrice> *-1
[21:10:48] <Cork> cockatrice: your sending with windows encloding
[21:10:54] <Cork> so its \r\n\r\n
[21:11:03] <cockatrice> I was just about to say that, haha.
[21:11:22] <cockatrice> Well, let's hope changing that will fix it all.
[21:12:26] <cockatrice> Now that's just strange
[21:12:33] <cockatrice> Now the h1 is floating in the middle of the text, lol.
[21:12:41] <cockatrice> But at least I fixed the bigger problem.
[21:13:46] <cockatrice> Got it!
[21:13:59] <cockatrice> I accidentally wrapped it in <h1> tags in the text file.
[21:14:08] <cockatrice> Thanks again for all of your help, Cork!
[21:14:41] <prefixed> ok. I am currently attempting to get each player on the following page to transition into the next player upon song completion. Could someone in here tell me where I'm going wrong, and why I'm seeing the following error? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'pushStack' http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/sEfK1fX5
[21:15:41] <Cork> cockatrice: your adding a h1 inside a h1 tag
[21:16:00] <cockatrice> Yeah, I fixed that
[21:16:06] <cockatrice> It's all dandy now.
[21:19:08] <opie-x> Cork: ahh, you can't see in my demo cause i don't host the images public, but locally here the images change in ie9, but the text doesn't
[21:19:39] <opie-x> Cork: which is crazy, cause i can see why you think it's the blur, but i don't buy that i think it's a repaint but
[21:19:43] <opie-x> bug*
[21:20:02] <opie-x> but yeah, the demo i showed you totally points to blur
[21:20:13] <opie-x> which is a red hering
[21:20:23] <prefixed> anyone? I am dying here!
[21:20:32] <Cork> opie-x: didn't try it in ie to be honnest
[21:20:46] <opie-x> yeah =)
[21:20:49] <Cork> opie-x: just know that change is flimsy on select element :=
[21:20:54] <Cork> =)
[21:21:13] <opie-x> yeah
[21:21:26] <opie-x> i've got an idea
[21:23:45] <Cork> opie-x: uh... your example works fine here on ie9
[21:23:58] <Cork> looks the same as in the other browsers
[21:24:19] <Cork> (had to boot up a vm, thats why it took some time)
[21:24:45] <opie-x> so, if i $.unwrap($container.wrap()) after the updates it works perfectly in ie
[21:25:05] <opie-x> ohh hmm
[21:25:15] <Cork> uh no i ment the old link works
[21:25:24] <opie-x> so what i was noticing is that when switching between 1 / 2 sometimes the name doesn't repaint
[21:25:36] <prefixed> :(
[21:25:55] <Cork> opie-x: your using one for change
[21:26:03] <Cork> opie-x: so as expected it only works once
[21:26:12] <opie-x> cork, keep reading
[21:26:22] <opie-x> the one simple shows it the first time and removes the select caption option
[21:26:30] <opie-x> then the change handles
[21:26:38] <opie-x> updating the ui
[21:26:44] <opie-x> it's a little ux trick i made up
[21:27:04] <Cork> hmm
[21:27:11] <Cork> that might actually be what breaks it
[21:27:21] <opie-x> no because you comment that line still does it
[21:27:43] <opie-x> it's an ie repaint issue
[21:28:13] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/frk73/5/ works with no update issue
[21:28:39] <Cork> so yes one is the problem
[21:29:21] <opie-x> well
[21:29:23] <opie-x> not true
[21:29:29] <opie-x> because of the show is now running everytime
[21:29:30] <opie-x> like i said
[21:29:39] <opie-x> wrap and unwrap and it works
[21:29:45] <opie-x> anything that causes styles to repaint the div
[21:29:50] <opie-x> i.e. show()
[21:29:53] <opie-x> just saying
[21:30:00] <opie-x> if you actually comment that it comes back
[21:30:39] <opie-x> just trying to get root cause but i like your determination to plays devils advocate here =)
[21:31:29] <Cork> opie-x: wrap/unwrap will actually serialize the dom and reparse the html
[21:31:40] <opie-x> well, yeah bad idea i guess =)
[21:31:49] <Cork> show just sets css display
[21:32:19] <opie-x> yeah, i'm not saying show isn't a much more effecient way to repaint
[21:35:02] <opie-x> ok so yeah i just did this then, seems to work great. thanks cork. =)
[21:35:09] <opie-x> http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/frk73/8/
[21:35:51] <opie-x> i'll go file the ie9 bug
[21:35:54] <opie-x> ;)
[21:36:36] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/frk73/9/ works too
[21:36:55] <Cork> opie-x: its actually the old "hasLayout" bug
[21:38:42] <Cork> opie-x: so just make the spans not inline, and it works fine
[21:38:54] <Cork> no need for any js changes
[21:44:03] <prefixed> ok. I am currently attempting to get each player on the following page to transition into the next player upon song completion. Could someone in here tell me where I'm going wrong, and why I'm seeing the following error? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'pushStack' http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/sEfK1fX5
[21:49:26] <opie-x> thanks cork
[21:49:29] <opie-x> you're right
[21:49:56] <opie-x> thanks
[21:52:49] <cockatrice> Now whenever I load other content, the container shifts back and forth.
[21:52:56] <cockatrice> http://braxtonspence.com/
[21:54:08] <Cork> you mean the bottom?
[21:54:39] <Cork> or do you mean the effect of the scrollbar?
[21:55:30] <Cork> cockatrice: body { overflow-y: scroll; }
[21:55:49] <cockatrice> No, horizontally.
[21:56:01] <Cork> so the bottom of the "paper"?
[21:56:02] <prefixed> hm
[21:56:06] <cockatrice> Also, I just changed it to have a minimum height for better transitions.
[21:56:08] <cockatrice> No, the sides.
[21:56:09] <prefixed> you are not very helpful
[21:56:16] <cockatrice> Click on "home", then "about me".
[21:56:23] <Cork> cockatrice: it doesn't shift here
[21:56:37] <cockatrice> It doesn't shift left or right for you?
[21:56:46] <Cork> only from the scroll bar
[21:56:58] <Cork> changed overflow-y: scroll and its dead stable
[21:57:07] <cockatrice> Oh, that's really odd.
[21:57:13] <prefixed> no
[21:57:22] <Cork> cockatrice: try setting body { overflow-y: scroll; }
[21:57:59] <cockatrice> OOOOh, I see what you're saying.
[21:58:05] <cockatrice> Hahah, I'm so dumb. Thanks.
[21:58:32] <cockatrice> I've set the minimum height to like 1000px so that was fixed right after I asked the problem anyway.
[21:58:43] <cockatrice> I think that is my last question for the night for you, hahah.
[22:00:09] <abjorn> :o
[22:00:10] <bot-t> (12 hours 9 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn lol wat you bastard
[22:00:21] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky you heard me bitch
[22:00:22] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[22:13:54] <Foxhoundz> .on('click'), click(), or bind('click')
[22:14:04] <Foxhoundz> Which is the prefered way of adding a click event listener
[22:14:16] <Foxhoundz> and why, pray tell, are there so many aliases for it
[22:14:51] <Eshu> HI guys
[22:14:59] <erank> hey
[22:15:02] <Eshu> i want to highlight the search result same like google map.
[22:15:22] <Cork> Foxhoundz: click(function() {}); or .on('click', function() {});
[22:15:53] <Eshu> Cork: Hi Cork
[22:16:09] <Cork> Foxhoundz: .on is the new way to handle binding events in jquery 1.7+, and bind is just an alias for it
[22:16:15] <Cork> Eshu: hi
[22:16:28] <Eshu> i want to highlight the search result same like google map
[22:16:36] <Eshu> in my google application
[22:16:55] <Cork> highligh search results on google map?
[22:17:27] <Cork> ah you mean in the autocomplete dropdown?
[22:17:56] <Foxhoundz> I see
[22:18:28] <Eshu> Cork
[22:18:33] <Cork> Foxhoundz: that said, theres no reason to sit down and rename your calls :)
[22:18:45] <erank> Does anybody knows how to shrink all elements (buttons, header, footer, text etc) in jQuery Mobile?
[22:18:46] <Eshu> Cork Wait I am Uploading the Image
[22:18:49] <Cork> Foxhoundz: the only ones you should do something about is .live if you use them
[22:19:05] <prefixed> ok. I am currently attempting to get each player on the following page to transition into the next player upon song completion. Could someone in here tell me where I'm going wrong, and why I'm seeing the following error? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDocument> has no method 'pushStack' http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/sEfK1fX5
[22:19:08] <Cork> Foxhoundz: the rest is find either way
[22:19:18] <Cork> *rest is fine
[22:19:39] <Cork> erank: css?
[22:20:24] <Eshu> Cork: plz see this Image i uploaded there http://imagebin.org/213658
[22:20:36] <Cork> wow >_>
[22:20:36] <Eshu> Cork: I want to do the same like this
[22:20:42] <Cork> never seen that before
[22:20:45] <erank> Cork, in the end I think this is the only way. I thought there was an easier way :/
[22:21:11] <Cork> erank: no, that is the easy way :)
[22:21:20] <Cork> css defines how things look
[22:21:55] <Eshu> Cork: have you seen the imah
[22:22:29] <Cork> Eshu: yes, thats why i said wow
[22:22:30] <erank> Cork, you are right but the "problem" is that I am new to jqm and don't know all the properties that need changing. A lot of trial and error
[22:22:42] * Cork feels cheated... it dosn't do it around here :/
[22:23:07] <Eshu> Cork; any idea how can we do that
[22:23:17] <Cork> erank: just inspect the dom tree with a browser debugger
[22:23:28] <Cork> Eshu: no, as i've never seen it before
[22:24:07] <Eshu> Okey then any idea ?
[22:24:13] <Cork> ah, it only works in map mode
[22:24:45] <Cork> Eshu: the overlay api
[22:25:06] <Cork> haven't fiddled with google maps api in ages though
[22:25:42] <erank> Cork: thanks dude, just wanted to be sure that it was not possible before actually doing it
[22:26:15] <Cork> erank: there might, though i don't think it should
[22:26:32] <Cork> erank: styling should be in css
[22:27:13] <Mavvok> How would i retrieve the value of the selected <option> of a <select> using JQuery?
[22:27:28] <Cork> $('select').val()
[22:30:53] <Mavvok> Cork: thanks
[23:11:32] <Mavvok> Do I need to use JSON to parse data from a php file?
[23:12:09] <tga> Mavvok: json is a data format, you can generate it with php and read it in your javascript
[23:13:24] <Cork> Mavvok: if your loading your data through ajax, then no
[23:13:54] <Cork> Mavvok: as long as you set the correct mimetype and its encoded as valid json, jquery will parse it for you
[23:14:36] <Cork> well you need to use getJSON or ajax({ dataType: 'json' }) too
[23:16:06] <Mavvok> Cork: thanks
[23:51:25] <Dr-Bombay> oh here's a "rock star" variant you haven't heard before
[23:51:27] <Dr-Bombay> I guarantee
[23:51:32] <Dr-Bombay> anyone here to hear this? It's good
