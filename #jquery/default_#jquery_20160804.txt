[00:13:10] <arc_> so i guess i can't just do .on('ajaxsuccess', and have it work for any type of xhr
[01:56:25] <Yepp> http://www.hastebin.com/nexuhokija.coffee
[01:56:38] <Yepp> calling valid() on click works
[01:56:55] <Yepp> it does not when I put it in on keyup and change
[01:57:03] <Yepp> same method used
[01:57:34] <Yepp> console log shows up true and false but the errors are not showing up
[01:58:14] <SlizardWizard> Is it possible to be able to scroll an oveflow:scroll; div?
[03:18:29] <SlizardWizard> I will take that as i have no clue
[03:50:21] <_Justice_> Do i need to activate jquery migrate somehow to show errors?
[03:51:13] <Justice> I used the cdn for jquery 3.1 and migrate 3.0. But from my understanding using $(document).on('ready' fun); should produce messages ?
[04:06:54] <obert> OT: what's wrong with prompt("Foo?"); ?
[04:55:34] <cecunguki> How to add <a href ="#blah>word</a> inner <div> while i click button
[05:02:20] <MarkX> $("#button").click(function(){     var kP = $("#kP").val();  $("#boxOutput").val(kP);     });
[05:03:24] <MarkX> sorry if this is a noobish question, is this enough to change the text in a textarea (id=boxOutput) to the text inside the input box (id=kP)
[05:06:30] <MarkX> omg nevermind i got it
[05:06:40] <MarkX> i had the ids set wrong in the html :(
[05:07:06] <cecunguk> Thanks for your answer MarKX i will try that
[05:07:17] <MarkX> cecunguk, ?
[05:07:20] <MarkX> try what?
[05:09:39] <cecunguk> Lol

[05:43:27] <DelphiWorld> hey all
[05:43:32] <DelphiWorld> var audio = createPlayer('assets/audio.mp3')
[05:43:48] <linski> ok
[05:43:49] <DelphiWorld> how could i retrieve the assets/audio.mp3 from a localstorage value?
[05:44:05] <matthewbe> I have an issue with array of elements, I can't retrieve an element as a jquery object
[05:44:16] <matthewbe> https://jsfiddle.net/akrs57vt/   outputs elements[0].next is not a function
[05:45:19] <linski> .next()
[05:45:27] <matthewbe> I did
[05:45:47] <matthewbe> it doesn't work
[05:47:26] <DelphiWorld> so what i want is to load the mp3 filename from a localstorage value and create the audio player
[05:47:26] <DelphiWorld> var audio = createPlayer('assets/audio.mp3')
[05:48:38] <linski> idk im a python dev, try doing a function within const then hit elements[0].next();?
[05:49:14] <matthewbe> linski, it's just jquery basics really, but I just don't understand
[05:49:24] <matthewbe> linski, i'll tell you when I find out
[05:52:21] <matthewbe> linski, looks like I have to wrap each element of the array as a jquery object again:-/ so $(elements[0]).next()
[05:53:08] <linski> or parent()
[05:53:36] <linski> parent().next()
[05:53:52] <linski> parent().prev()
[05:54:40] <linski> as long as it works i guess
[06:46:44] <Duikb00t-home> o/
[07:06:34] <stennowork> good day, i have an element with some text in it <div>abcdefgh</div>. how can insert another element right after the third character ("c") so the result would be <div>abc<span>foo</span>defgh</div> ?
[07:07:51] <stennowork> the first idea would be to fetch the text and clear the element, split the text, append the first part, append the other element, then append the second part
[07:43:48] <chrisml> anyone know why select2 doesn't show the default option? https://jsfiddle.net/pe2jpex6/1/
[08:21:56] <Dulcin> Hi, bear with me: I have a jquery ajax get call, and on success I check if there's data. On my server I return an empty HTTP response. Now on ubuntu chromium/firefox it works it tells me there's no data. On Windows 10 Edge/Chrome it tells me there is no data, but on another PC with Windows 10, same version of Chrome, it tells me there is a newline in the response, which it considers data. The other Windows 10 PC with Chrome is the exact same version as the
[08:21:56] <Dulcin> other
[08:22:20] <Dulcin> I have no idea how to figure out what the difference is and why it's causing it to think that the empty response is not empty. Is this a familiar issue?
[08:22:40] <Dulcin> They're on the same network, I tried both icognito
[08:46:50] <ESTNSC> i need help on my code http://pastebin.com/PFGeS0RF
[09:06:59] <maxpen> can someone help me out here with replacing <trust> to <li> https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/sr950f2p/
[09:09:11] <xec> maxpen: https://jsfiddle.net/sr950f2p/1/
[09:09:43] <xec> maxpen: you were finding all the <trust> elements, then doing $(this).html(), which woul only return the content inside a <trust>
[09:10:02] <xec> i just removed it from the selector so you fetch the contents of the <ul> instead
[09:10:31] <shoky> Dulcin: what does "it tells me" mean?
[09:10:36] <maxpen> xec awesome
[09:11:19] <Dulcin> shoky: well simply put if I write if(data) it is false on my machines
[09:11:27] <xec> maxpen: you still have the stray commas though, so it's still invalid html
[09:11:57] <shoky> Dulcin: check the devtools network tab which shows the actual response.. if that looks ok then maybe the problem is with your code, which we'd need to see i guess..
[09:11:58] <Dulcin> I just realized the other machine I was testing on is on a different network, so somehow a newline is added because it's not on my local network
[09:11:59] <maxpen> xec that was going to be my next issue/question how do I target the , and replace it with a dot
[09:12:20] <maxpen> and remove the and
[09:12:50] <xec> maxpen: you could fetch all the trust instead, create all new html with their contents, and discard the rest
[09:13:31] <maxpen> good plan xec, how would I go about doing that, haven't done that too often, is tehre a working example I can look at?
[09:13:50] <Dulcin> shoky: Well on my machines (within my LAN) the response is empty it says 'this request has no response data available'
[09:14:16] <Dulcin> shoky: On the machine that is on a different LAN behind our firewall, the response is the newline
[09:14:43] <shoky> Dulcin: then the response has a newline, and the issue is with your server/network.. not your jquery
[09:15:09] <shoky> if you see the newline in the response in the network tab.. then it's there ;p
[09:15:17] <xec> maxpen: this assumes there is only one <div> and <ul> https://jsfiddle.net/sr950f2p/2/
[09:15:38] <wa5ted> shoky ehhhhhhhhh
[09:15:46] <Dulcin> yeah it is there for sure, but what is adding it, it's such a weird issue
[09:15:47] <shoky> wa5ted unghhhhhhhhhhh
[09:15:54] <wa5ted> :(
[09:15:57] <wa5ted> what i do....
[09:15:58] <shoky> Dulcin: maybe your server-side code, who knows
[09:16:03] <Dulcin> and I'm no expert on networking so I guess I'll never figure it out
[09:16:05] <shoky> wa5ted about?
[09:16:18] <wa5ted> you no lieky i said hi
[09:16:27] <shoky> Dulcin: i doubt it's a network issue, probably a server code/configuration issue
[09:16:47] <Dulcin> It's a django development server, maybe that is causing the issue
[09:17:02] <shoky> wa5ted i just replied in the same manner as your greeting :|
[09:17:05] <xec> wa5ted: "ehhhhhhhhh" != "hi" i guess :D
[09:17:12] <taplar> canadian
[09:17:15] <wa5ted> ^^
[09:17:24] <xec> btw, hi shoky!
[09:17:26] <wa5ted> shoky hi, long time no see or talk
[09:17:33] <AwkwardCough> or the fonze
[09:17:36] <shoky> unghhhhh = israeli for joyous bliss, ok??
[09:17:45] <wa5ted> oooouuuuu
[09:17:45] <shoky> heya dudes ;]
[09:17:46] <wa5ted> okay
[09:17:48] <taplar> AwkwardCough: true!
[09:17:50] <shoky> (not really)
[09:17:59] <taplar> was he also canadian?
[09:18:05] <taplar> that'd be a twist
[09:18:06] <wa5ted> me or AwkwardCough
[09:18:26] <taplar> fonze
[09:18:59] <AwkwardCough> nah dude was american thru and thru
[09:19:10] <taplar> that's a shame
[09:20:45] <Bent0> Probably an easy fix but I cant see it. https://jsfiddle.net/kueL5hsp/   Whenever I click the button, send the form and then do it again without reloading the page the form gets send twice. Do it again three times, them 4 times etc. (See console). Anyone know how to fix this?
[09:21:50] <taplar> your rebinding sumbit on every popover event
[09:21:58] <shoky> Dulcin: i don't mind looking at relevant django routes/code if you pastebin it, if you want
[09:22:22] <Bent0> taplar: Not sure how to fix that. Any idea?
[09:22:26] <taplar> don't do that
[09:22:29] <taplar> only bind once
[09:22:56] <Bent0> but how :p
[09:23:03] <taplar> 99% of the time you don't want to bind inside of an event handler
[09:23:17] <taplar> move it outside of the event handler?
[09:23:47] <maxpen> thank you xec got it to work perfectly
[09:23:48] <Bent0> When I do that the thing does not fire. Because the popover is written to the DOM then clicking the REPORT button
[09:24:06] <Bent0> thats why Im using the on('shown.bs.popover
[09:24:10] <taplar> so the form does not exist on page load?
[09:24:13] <Bent0> nope
[09:24:52] <taplar> so bind when they click the report button
[09:24:58] <taplar> once you know it exists
[09:25:56] <taplar> they click the report button, it creates the form, then bind, done
[09:26:36] <shoky> or use event delegation
[09:26:59] <Bent0> I tried this instead of the shown.bs.popover but that just results in the same outcome: $('#addreport').click(function(){
[09:27:03] <Bent0> #addreport is the report button
[09:27:08] <taplar> i wouldn't think that would work with the form, since he's trying to cancel it
[09:27:16] <shoky> $(document).on('submit', '#report_form', function(e) { ...
[09:27:19] <taplar> since it would have propagated out by then
[09:27:31] <shoky> you can cancel a bubbled event
[09:27:34] <taplar> oh?
[09:27:44] <shoky> yea, bubbling and canceling are 2 separate things
[09:27:44] <taplar> i thought i ran into issues with that in the past with forms
[09:27:54] <marw> how do I block href and execute onclick javascript function in same link? event.preventDefault() ignored js function and href was still working.
[09:28:03] <shoky> hmm don't think i've ran into issues with that
[09:28:08] <Bent0> Could you show me that in the jsfiddle? kind of lost here
[09:28:12] <shoky> but i might be wrong donno
[09:29:02] <shoky> https://jsfiddle.net/kueL5hsp/1/
[09:30:04] <Bent0> That works wonders :-D Cheers guys
[09:30:23] <taplar> huh, wonder what i did wrong in the past.  many things i'm sure
[09:32:24] <shoky> it rings a bell that there's some related issue regarding preventDefault and bubbling,  but maybe more with keydown/up/press type events
[09:37:45] <hellyeah-SVG> hey
[09:37:52] <taplar> yo
[09:38:35] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  how goes?
[09:38:50] <taplar> forever onwards, :)
[09:39:16] <hellyeah-SVG> what does onwards mean?
[09:39:34] <hellyeah-SVG> like dont look back?
[09:39:45] <AwkwardCough> pretty much
[09:39:48] <AwkwardCough> moving forward
[09:39:54] <hellyeah-SVG> ic
[09:40:02] <taplar> advancing
[09:41:39] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  is there any further suggestion about my code? http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/
[09:42:14] <shoky> how about proper indentation? :)
[09:42:49] <taplar> not really right now.  last i looked at it the big thing that i was looking as was your use of 'box1' and 'box2' and the like
[09:43:13] <taplar> instead of descriptive classes or variables like 'month'
[09:43:42] <Dulcin> shoky: It's not even the django development server, I uploaded it to my (local) test server, which has nginx with uwsgi on it, and the issue remains the same
[09:44:02] <taplar> got some stuff i have to focus on now so i can't really spend a lot of time right now deep diving other code
[09:44:03] * hellyeah-SVG i will tidy up
[09:44:29] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/10/
[09:44:30] <taplar> but descriptive classes and variables +100
[09:44:32] <hellyeah-SVG> ops
[09:44:33] <Dulcin> shoky: gonna see if the issue remains if I visit it from an external IP
[09:44:35] <hellyeah-SVG> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/10/
[09:45:08] <Ice_Strike> $('.child-row-'. rowID)
[09:45:16] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  thanks good lock with the code you need to focus on
[09:45:17] <Ice_Strike> How do I get html from this class?
[09:45:26] <hellyeah-SVG> .html() ?
[09:45:32] <Ice_Strike> Tried that
[09:45:37] <shoky> that's not valid javascript
[09:45:41] <hellyeah-SVG> fiddle
[09:45:43] <Ice_Strike>   htmlChild = $('.child-row-'. rowID).html();
[09:45:44] <hellyeah-SVG> . rowId
[09:45:47] <hellyeah-SVG> what is that
[09:45:54] <Ice_Strike> Oops you are right
[09:45:56] <taplar> period is php appending
[09:46:02] <Ice_Strike> Forgot to add +
[09:46:03] <hellyeah-SVG> you check the console?
[09:46:10] <Ice_Strike>                 htmlChild = $('.child-row-' + rowID).html();
[09:46:10] <Ice_Strike>                 row.child(addChildRow(htmlChild)).show();
[09:46:15] <hellyeah-SVG> what is the error on your console?
[09:46:40] <hellyeah-SVG> shoky:  any suggestion?
[09:46:43] <hellyeah-SVG> .d
[09:47:18] <Ice_Strike> I am getting undefined
[09:47:26] <Ice_Strike> htmlChild = $('.child-row-' + rowID).html();
[09:47:33] <Ice_Strike> onsole.log(htmlChild);
[09:47:39] <shoky> hellyeah-SVG: too long for me to look at.. also think i had enough of your datepickers for a lifetime :D
[09:47:41] <taplar> what is rowID?
[09:47:48] <shoky> hellyeah-SVG: sorry :)
[09:47:53] <hellyeah-SVG> ShekharReddy:  okey :D no problem
[09:48:00] <hellyeah-SVG> see you in the different code :D
[09:48:08] <shoky> :)
[09:48:14] <hellyeah-SVG> Ice_Strike:  you should think to do a fiddle
[09:49:08] <hellyeah-SVG> Ice_Strike:  js fiddle
[09:49:22] <taplar> btw, what's up with the -SVG ?
[09:50:01] <shoky> Dulcin: well it could be something with your django app/config/template/code in general, not necessarily the dev server
[09:50:41] <Ice_Strike> hellyeah-SVG Sure
[09:51:13] <Ice_Strike> Before I do that
[09:51:14] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar:  i have a project idea
[09:51:19] <Ice_Strike> <tr class="child-row-1"> ... </tr>
[09:51:26] <Ice_Strike> $('.child-row-' + rowID).html(); is right?
[09:51:27] <hellyeah-SVG> i will draw a server room with svg
[09:51:32] <taplar> what is rowID?
[09:51:33] <Ice_Strike> rowID is workign fine
[09:51:51] <Ice_Strike>   var rowID = $(tr).data('row');
[09:51:55] <hellyeah-SVG> rowId is probably a number
[09:51:58] <Ice_Strike> Yes
[09:52:03] <Ice_Strike> click event
[09:52:04] <taplar> 'probably' isn't a good thing
[09:52:23] <hellyeah-SVG> you have many childrow from 1 to ... for example right
[09:52:30] <Ice_Strike> yes
[09:52:42] <Ice_Strike> I'll pastebin html
[09:52:48] <shoky> your selector is wrong, or the element doesn't exist at the time you're running this
[09:52:52] <hellyeah-SVG> and you want to make all childrow clickable
[09:52:56] <hellyeah-SVG> icedp:
[09:52:57] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[09:52:58] <hellyeah-SVG> ops
[09:53:05] <hellyeah-SVG> make a jsfiddle dont pastebin it
[09:53:09] <Ice_Strike> ok :)
[09:53:58] <taplar> and there is also form#report_form
[09:54:00] <taplar> crap
[09:54:06] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:54:19] <Ice_Strike> do I need to include jquery file in  jsfiddle ?
[09:54:29] <hellyeah-SVG> yes
[09:54:31] <taplar> there is a javascript cog
[09:54:38] <hellyeah-SVG> you can do it from dropdowwn menu
[09:54:42] <taplar> top right corner of the jquery section
[09:54:47] <hellyeah-SVG> you see pure javascript
[09:54:47] <taplar> err, javascript section
[09:54:50] <Ice_Strike> Oh I see
[09:54:54] <Ice_Strike> That was quite hidden!
[09:54:54] <hellyeah-SVG> do this jquery 2.1.3 for example
[10:01:20] <Ice_Strike> hellyeah-SVG https://jsfiddle.net/phbyatjt/
[10:01:38] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar_:  and shoky knows better than me
[10:01:38] <Ice_Strike> see html = $('.child-row-' + rowID).html(); in the code
[10:01:51] <hellyeah-SVG> you should ask generally instead of directing question to someone
[10:01:54] <hellyeah-SVG> let me check
[10:03:05] <hellyeah-SVG> there are some errors
[10:03:11] <hellyeah-SVG> did you check the console?
[10:04:19] <EugenA> hi, I'd like to disable my both submit buttons on submit
[10:04:41] <hellyeah-SVG> you get undefined when you click + on the table
[10:04:44] <hellyeah-SVG> is that the problem?
[10:05:00] <EugenA> the problem is, if I disable them and do then .submit() the buttons are not in the POST
[10:05:28] <EugenA> but I need them there, because I do different actions depending on button id
[10:07:46] <EugenA> as workaround I can hide buttons... but I'd like to make them not clickable
[10:09:25] <hellyeah-SVG> Ice_Strike:  you have some problems about selecting elements
[10:10:50] <Ice_Strike> hellyeah-SVG I didnt get problem when I get rowID
[10:10:52] <Ice_Strike> It show number
[10:11:06] <AwkwardCough> EugenA: I think you can do something like "pointer-events: none;" for a css class
[10:11:27] <AwkwardCough> then just add and remove the class as needed
[10:11:35] <Sliya> Hi, I want to send a "delete" request using ajax with the id of the resource to delete, but the only way I found was to add the parameter in the url. Why can't I pass them to the $.ajax "data" field (like I do whith a GET) ?
[10:11:45] <hellyeah-SVG> it showed number on the if
[10:12:28] <Ice_Strike> Problem is  $('.child-row-' + rowID).html()
[10:12:34] <hellyeah-SVG> ah sorry
[10:12:36] <Ice_Strike> couldnt find: <tr class="child-row-1">
[10:12:37] <hellyeah-SVG> sec
[10:14:59] <hellyeah-SVG> Ice_Strike:
[10:15:10] <hellyeah-SVG> html() method may not be the method you are looking for
[10:15:19] <hellyeah-SVG> you want to content of clicked row right
[10:15:28] <taplar_> the selector is not working
[10:15:49] <taplar_> oh
[10:15:50] <Ice_Strike> hellyeah-SVG get the content from <tr class="child-row-1"> .. </tr>
[10:15:57] <taplar_> you have <tr> outside of a table dude
[10:16:07] <Ice_Strike> $('.child-row-' + rowID).html() would equal = <tr class="child-row-x"> .. </tr>
[10:16:08] <taplar_> that's invalid markup
[10:16:25] <Ice_Strike> taplar_ I know.
[10:16:33] <hellyeah-SVG> taplar_:  selector seems work in line 2 https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/phbyatjt/1/
[10:16:57] <hellyeah-SVG> i got object object
[10:16:59] <Dulcin> shoky: http://pastebin.com/nd52vqqM
[10:17:11] <hellyeah-SVG> anyway i need to go launch
[10:17:14] <Dulcin> shoky: I completely stripped my code and the issue persists
[10:17:25] <taplar_> $() always returns an object hellyeah-SVG
[10:17:29] <taplar_> the issue is the invalid markup
[10:17:35] <taplar_> if you change the div to a table, it works
[10:17:43] <hellyeah-SVG> ah
[10:17:53] <Ice_Strike> Hmmm
[10:17:56] <Ice_Strike> Let me tey
[10:17:58] <Ice_Strike> try
[10:18:03] <taplar_> <table> and it's sub elements are among the most strict tags in html
[10:18:09] <hellyeah-SVG> Ice_Strike:
[10:18:14] <taplar_> they must belong to their expected parents
[10:18:14] <hellyeah-SVG> this is really obvious mistake
[10:18:53] <hellyeah-SVG> anyway gotta launch
[10:19:09] <Ice_Strike> Work great, thanks. I thought even invalid markup is wrong, <tr>  in div should work
[10:19:13] <Ice_Strike> hmm
[10:19:15] <taplar_> nope
[10:19:23] <taplar_> the dom will not accept them
[10:20:28] <chrisml> i have a div with links and form elements in, i want to be able to click the div as a link, but still want the links and buttons inside it to work. whats the best way?
[10:21:02] <taplar_> stop propagation on the click of the sub links
[10:22:45] <chrisml> taplar_ so on all the inner handlers, event.stopPropagation(); ?
[10:22:53] <taplar_> yup
[10:23:02] <chrisml> taplar_ thanks
[10:23:41] <Sliya> Hi, I want to send a "delete" request using ajax with the id of the resource to delete, but the only way I found was to add the parameter in the url. Why can't I pass them to the $.ajax "data" field (like I do whith a GET) ?
[10:24:58] <shoky> Dulcin: no idea sorry
[10:25:24] <Dulcin> shoky: Yeah that's what I'm thinking as well :D
[10:25:26] <shoky> Sliya: you can
[10:27:18] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/vu37Lrdb/1/ works fine
[10:29:15] <shoky> Dulcin: if you want to take screenshots of the 2 different requests/responses in the network tab (including headers & body), maybe i'll see something there... ;p
[10:29:22] <Sliya> taplar_ When I do that, I can't access the data in my script on the server
[10:29:42] <Sliya> I have to pass them in the uri
[10:30:08] <shoky> Sliya: you can access it, it's just not query params in the url as GET data,  it's in the response body like a POST
[10:31:06] <taplar_> idr if php has a $_DELETE if your working with that
[10:33:01] <Justice> a question about scoping here. When you run stuff in <script> tags its global but when you do it in js files the vars and methods are only visible in their own file right?
[10:33:22] <chrisml> no
[10:33:24] <taplar_> in the page or in a file, they are the same
[10:33:54] <Justice> how can you make a method private/global
[10:33:59] <shoky> both are <script> tags ;p
[10:34:06] <taplar_> global, don't use var
[10:34:09] <taplar_> or assign to window
[10:34:15] <taplar_> which you really don't want to do alot
[10:34:24] <taplar_> making private, use closures
[10:34:32] <chrisml> google iife
[10:37:31] <Justice> hmhm
[10:37:33] <jomofcw> Hello !
[10:37:49] <jomofcw> Is there an event that mean "when appended to the DOM" ?
[10:38:02] <taplar_> nope
[10:38:53] <jomofcw> Hello taplar_ :). OK thanks.
[10:39:33] <alluringme> Hi jsPDF does not have support for languages other than English? When I export it displays chars such as ?®?Á?
[10:40:07] <Dulcin> shoky: I found it, it was a fucking proxy in the firewall adding the newline, pardon my french
[10:40:23] <alluringme> English exports work like a charm. :O
[10:40:36] <Dulcin> but I have been trying to debug it for the past 6 hours :')
[10:40:47] <taplar_> jomofcw: you can read up on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FMutationObserver if the browser support works for you
[10:41:54] <jomofcw> Thanks taplar_ :).
[10:43:17] <chrisml> taplar_ if i have static links (no event handlers) inside the clickable div, should i handle them with js so i can stop propagation?
[10:43:49] <alluringme> Nvm, I got my answer. :/ It just wont work: https://codepen.io/MrBeerBrewer/pen/mEzEgJ
[10:43:59] <taplar_> chrisml: not sure what you mean.
[10:44:13] <alluringme> Any solutions to make it support a particular language?
[10:44:28] <chrisml> taplar_ like i have an fb share button which is just a normal link, when i click it, it first the event for the parent div which i want to be clickable
[10:44:40] <chrisml> s/first/fires
[10:44:40] <b-ot> Correction, <chrisml> taplar_ like i have an fb share button which is just a normal link, when i click it, it fires the event for the parent div which i want to be clickable
[10:44:45] <shoky> Dulcin: yuck. nice find ;]
[10:44:59] <taplar_> if you click the link it should fire that link, and then fire the div click link
[10:45:13] <chrisml> yeah i don't want it to fire the div click event
[10:45:24] <taplar_> right, which is what the stopPropagation is for
[10:45:41] <chrisml> yeah, so i need to handle the fb share with js rather than href
[10:46:03] <taplar_> no, you just attach a click handler to the inner links
[10:46:24] <chrisml> that's what i mean
[10:46:39] <taplar_> 'rather than href' is confusing me, lol
[10:46:47] <chrisml> lol
[10:46:51] <chrisml> it's just a normal link atm
[10:46:57] <chrisml> no event handler attached
[10:47:11] <chrisml> when you click it, it fires the event on the div, i don't want it to
[10:47:25] <chrisml> so i need to attach an event listener to it to stop propagation
[10:47:44] <taplar_> right, but you'll still have an href on it
[10:47:49] <chrisml> yeah that's fine
[10:47:52] <chrisml> :D
[10:47:56] <taplar_> the 'rather than' is confusing me
[10:48:00] <taplar_> your not changing things
[10:48:02] <taplar_> your adding things
[10:50:41] <chrisml> taplar_ thank you anyway. i have maybe 30% more understanding of event propagation now :D
[10:51:02] <taplar_> you need a small example?
[10:51:29] <chrisml> does it just mean that it stops "parent" events firing?
[10:51:55] <taplar_> it makes the browser not pass the event further back to the previous parents
[10:52:01] <taplar_> it stops the bubbling
[10:52:05] <chrisml> yeah
[10:52:13] <chrisml> gotya
[11:13:12] <chrisml> taplar_ the parent div is firing on focus of inputs, i've tried attach event handlers on focus and active and stopping propagation, but no luck
[11:14:50] <taplar_> oy
[11:14:54] <taplar_> sorry
[11:15:00] <taplar_> it's firing on focus?
[11:15:23] <chrisml> the parent event is firing when you click inside a textarea, text input, label
[11:15:23] <chrisml> etc
[11:15:34] <taplar_> lol
[11:15:47] <taplar_> yeah, that makes sense
[11:16:00] <taplar_> remind me again, why is your outer div clickable? ;)
[11:21:23] <chrisml> taplar_ to take you to the page it is about
[11:22:17] <taplar_> just giving you a hard time
[11:22:31] <chrisml> lol
[11:22:36] <taplar_> though it is strange you have something clickable that has many things in it that you don't want to trigger it on
[11:22:39] <taplar_> but anyway
[11:22:45] <chrisml> yep
[11:22:50] <chrisml> because they do their own things
[11:23:08] <taplar_> an easier way of doing this may be to attach a click handler to the div, and check if the original event matches itself
[11:23:15] <taplar_> if not, prevent default
[11:23:59] <chrisml> original event matches itself?
[11:24:36] <taplar_> yeah, so the event will have a property on it telling what element it originated from
[11:24:47] <taplar_> if you click on a sub child and not the div, it will be that sub child
[11:24:55] <chrisml> yep
[11:24:56] <chrisml> hmm
[11:29:45] <chrisml> taplar_ but i dunno why the parent event is firing on the inputs, as i've done $('.form-control').on('click focus', // stop propagation) :(
[11:30:35] <taplar_> is form control on all those textarea, text input, labels, etc?
[11:30:52] <chrisml> taplar_ not label
[11:32:07] <chrisml> but the label is for a checkbox (which doesnt have that class)
[11:32:40] <Duikb00t-home> o/ o/
[11:32:50] <taplar_> sure, but any time you click on anything inside the div, the click will propagate unless you stop it
[11:32:58] <chrisml> yep
[11:33:13] <chrisml> i'll do it the other way
[11:33:14] <chrisml> lol
[11:33:22] <chrisml> git checkout .
[11:35:26] <PCatinean> hey guys, there's a bite of code that calls a function passing the result of my function inside a try except block
[11:35:38] <PCatinean> is there any way I can return something with my function that would throw a specific error up?
[11:35:56] <taplar_> sure or your method can throw the error
[11:42:30] <PCatinean> taplar_, I tried but it didn't catch
[11:42:32] <PCatinean> what's the syntax?
[11:43:02] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/bivonalima.coffee
[11:43:14] <PCatinean> onload my method
[11:45:31] <taplar_> throw <something>
[11:45:43] <taplar_> ex. throw "weee";
[11:45:54] <taplar_> ex throw new Error("Invalid Username");
[11:46:09] <taplar_> you can throw whatever
[11:47:16] <PCatinean> i tried the first, did not work
[11:48:25] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/e8pgteud/
[11:58:48] <Duikb00t-home> o/ damn
[11:58:53] <taplar_> ?
[11:59:11] <Duikb00t-home> I have something in my head now I have to represent it in jquery :D
[11:59:29] <taplar_> lol, for a second i though you were referring to your <head>
[11:59:34] <Duikb00t-home> a table sorter wich holds the position of the TR and saves that order in the DB.
[11:59:35] <taplar_> like, what's the problem?  lol
[11:59:41] <Duikb00t-home> So on the front-end it will render in that order
[11:59:47] <Duikb00t-home> ui-sortable?
[11:59:59] <taplar_> doesn't play nice with <table>s
[12:00:04] <Duikb00t-home> Just stared with: https://jsfiddle.net/x9ffsb5t/1/
[12:00:22] <taplar_> well, maybe sortable does, i forget.
[12:04:46] <Duikb00t-home> Is there a way I can make sure it's being loaded in the right order? https://jsfiddle.net/x9ffsb5t/2/
[12:05:00] <Duikb00t-home> in a fiddle? Seems it's not loading the jquery-ui at the right time
[12:05:41] <taplar_> iirc, the external resources on fiddle are loaded after the cog ones
[12:06:40] <Duikb00t-home> Should be right then Hmmz
[12:06:58] <Duikb00t-home> nvm it forgot to save some resources
[12:07:56] <Duikb00t-home> yeah it started doing ' something' already https://jsfiddle.net/x9ffsb5t/5/
[12:08:24] <Duikb00t-home> SWEET https://jsfiddle.net/x9ffsb5t/6/
[12:09:21] <Duikb00t-home> Now I have to find myself a way how to save the 'order' of the sortable thing
[12:09:25] <Duikb00t-home> so I can save it in my DB
[12:09:29] <Duikb00t-home> and I can loop it in that order
[12:11:58] <taplar_> i'd suggest a column for that
[12:12:01] <taplar_> "sequence" perhaps
[12:12:04] <Duikb00t-home> wait wait
[12:12:12] <Duikb00t-home> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15633341/jquery-ui-sortable-then-write-order-into-a-database
[12:12:14] <Duikb00t-home> muhah
[12:13:01] <taplar_> "position", that works too
[12:13:17] <Duikb00t-home> iinstead of serialize?
[12:13:27] <taplar_> no, the name of the column in the table
[12:13:30] <Duikb00t-home> oh ok :)
[12:13:33] <taplar_> notice their sql update statement
[12:13:51] <Duikb00t-home> / UPDATE [Table] SET [Position] = $i WHERE [EntityId] = $value
[12:14:05] <taplar_> yeah, kinda pseudocode, but it gives the idea
[12:14:09] <Duikb00t-home> indeed
[12:14:42] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/22190656/ - How do i get the data from $.ajax? always getting null, empty.
[12:15:04] <taplar_> you use the data in the success method
[12:15:15] <taplar_> or pass it to a method to use it from within the success method
[12:15:37] <taplar_> by it's nature, ajax is asynchronous.  any logic you do after it that is not in a callback can/will execute before it finishes
[12:16:11] <taplar_> otherwise the way your trying to do it
[12:16:22] <taplar_> have the method return $.ajax();
[12:16:29] <taplar_> this will return the deferred/promise
[12:16:38] <taplar_> and you can attach a then() or done() to it
[12:16:57] <taplar_> async: false, <-- don't do this
[12:17:06] <taplar_> it's deprecated and also locks your browser
[12:18:17] <Duikb00t-home> wowow :D
[12:18:24] <Duikb00t-home> Im now setting up the route for the AJAX call :P
[12:21:53] <Duikb00t-home> https://www.pastery.net/uaruwu/ so far taplar_lunch
[12:21:56] <Duikb00t-home> Have a great lunch.
[12:27:17] <taplar_lunch> cool
[12:40:49] <Duikb00t-home> taplar_lunch:  sweet my ajax call works
[12:41:01] <Duikb00t-home> Now I have to pass in the position somewhere I guess?
[12:41:20] <Duikb00t-home> to pass it to the php method and execute an update
[12:41:33] <taplar_lunch> i thought that was part of the serialize deal
[12:41:41] <Duikb00t-home> ohhh
[12:47:25] <Duikb00t-home> Have you an idea how I can console.log the 'current'position
[12:47:59] <taplar_lunch> what do you mean?
[12:48:20] <Duikb00t-home> Well evertime the ajax call is happening I would like to console.log the position to check its correct
[12:48:57] <Duikb00t-home> When I just console.log(data); i retrieve an empty line
[12:49:41] <Duikb00t-home> https://www.pastery.net/marrgx/  that's what I do currently
[12:50:13] <taplar_lunch> your sortable is on your tbody and not the top level table?
[12:51:09] <Duikb00t-home> When I change that... my whole table is draggable :D
[12:51:20] <Duikb00t-home> When I do it like that... it works on the front-end.
[12:51:40] <taplar_lunch> can you make a working fiddle showing the issue?
[12:51:55] <Duikb00t-home> hmmm.
[12:52:43] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/x9ffsb5t/7/
[12:52:44] <Duikb00t-home> there you go
[12:57:27] <taplar_lunch> your tr's doing have an id on them
[12:57:35] <taplar_lunch> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize
[12:59:06] <Duikb00t-home> hmm oh
[12:59:10] <Duikb00t-home> I have no ID's on the trs atm
[12:59:31] <taplar_lunch> yep, however according to the documentation that's what serialize is looking for
[12:59:44] <Duikb00t-home> Hmm
[12:59:53] <Duikb00t-home> Thinking about how I should generate them
[13:00:26] <Duikb00t-home> Taking the dish-id is not a good idea
[13:40:52] <hellyeah> yoÄ±
[13:41:36] <Duikb00t-home> oy
[13:42:07] <taplar_lunch> vey
[13:42:30] <SpecialTech> has anybody ever heard of something called "DuP Framework"?
[13:42:45] <SpecialTech> I've never heard that before, the only thing close enough I can remember is "DuPont Framework"
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:42:56] <hellyeah> today i hheard ionic
[13:43:12] <hellyeah> ionic framework
[13:43:21] <robertmaxrees> hah, ionic's been around for a while.  we forked their icons for our own uses.
[13:44:33] <hellyeah> jquery fork
[13:44:34] <hellyeah> it
[13:44:38] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[13:44:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:44:49] <robertmaxrees> by "we" i mean "my company"
[13:44:50] <hellyeah> aha
[13:44:52] <hellyeah> sorry
[13:44:53] <taplar_lunch> git fork
[13:45:00] <taplar_lunch> not jquery fork
[13:45:00] <hellyeah> forkerd the icon :D
[13:45:45] <taplar_lunch> it's terminology going back to multi-processing
[13:46:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:48:23] <arc_> robertmaxrees don't you work for jquery?!?!
[13:48:35] <robertmaxrees> arc_ nope.
[13:48:41] <arc_> lol i was joking
[13:48:47] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:48:57] <robertmaxrees> people have asked me that before and been serious.
[13:49:43] <hellyeah> code is long i am sorry for that can you check line2-274 i couldnt find the error. The thingh i want to do is to click datepicker's title and selec month and open datepicker with  specified month . line 238 for "from" lline 270 for "to" should do that also you can pick different year by slicking dialog's title pls can you help me with that?
[13:49:46] <arc_> so is there any way to trigger something on any xhr, even if it's not ajax
[13:50:04] <arc_> i actually don't quite understand the difference between xhr and ajax but ajaxsuccess is not working in this case
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:50:15] <robertmaxrees> xhr IS ajax.
[13:50:25] <arc_> that's what i thought before : /
[13:50:31] * hellyeah i am at the top of pleasure hahah
[13:50:50] <robertmaxrees> XHR is short for XMLHttpRequest - basically the same thing.
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> arc_ so what are you seeing that's telling you it's NOT the same?
[13:51:23] <arc_> i know what it stands for, but i'm trying to do .on('ajaxsuccess' and it doesn't fire when an xhr request is clearly being made
[13:51:29] <arc_> i have done this successfully in a userscript on another site
[13:51:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you binding to?
[13:51:47] <arc_> document
[13:52:14] <robertmaxrees> try $(document).ajaxSuccess() instead.
[13:52:20] <arc_> hm, ok
[13:52:24] <arc_> i'll try that, thanks
[13:52:25] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, then they're not using jquery for their ajax calls.
[13:52:52] <arc_> well they might not be. so if they aren't, .on('ajaxsuccess' won't work?
[13:53:19] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you want .ajaxSuccess() unless something changed.  and no - those custom events/bindings don't work.
[13:53:41] <arc_> all right, thanks
[13:54:07] <arc_> what's the difference between using .on() and using .ajaxSuccess()?
[13:54:28] <robertmaxrees> afaik jquery doesn't use normal event emitters for the global ajax event handlers.
[13:54:44] <hellyeah> on is for binding
[13:54:48] <taplar_lunch> ajaxSuccess, iirc, is like setting up a global succes: handler
[13:54:51] <arc_> idk what that means really, but i've used it like that before
[13:54:53] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:55:00] <taplar_lunch> that will be used for all proceeding calls
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i don't think that was ever officially supported.
[13:55:10] <hellyeah> is ajaxSucces a callback?
[13:55:11] <arc_> i see
[13:55:50] <taplar_lunch> you give it a callback hellyeah
[13:56:09] <taplar_lunch> think of it like this, say you have 50 ajax calls
[13:56:21] <taplar_lunch> and, for some weird reason, they all need to use the same success callback
[13:56:41] <taplar_lunch> if you didn't want to do it on every one of them, you can use ajaxSuccess and then you don't have to specify them
[13:56:46] <taplar_lunch> *for the ajax calls
[13:57:44] <taplar_lunch> actually it could make sense in one case
[13:57:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:57:51] <taplar_lunch> if success callbacks stack
[13:57:55] <hellyeah> 50 ajax call in one time
[13:58:05] <arc_> i always thought of it as something that would be used for like maintenance purposes
[13:58:07] <taplar_lunch> then you could do a ajaxSuccess() giving it a handler that does auth logic checking
[13:58:09] <hellyeah> it can be right
[13:58:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:58:22] <taplar_lunch> which could execute prior to your other specific success handlers
[13:58:36] <hellyeah> understand
[13:58:40] <robertmaxrees> i still wouldn't use it then.
[13:58:43] <robertmaxrees> but (meh)
[13:59:20] <arc_> now i see that this site isn't using jquery at all so i am pretty confused why it wasn't throwing errors before
[13:59:33] <hellyeah> cant you handle that by using success callback?
[13:59:39] <hellyeah> ajax is async thing
[13:59:42] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you want to use the promises instead.
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> and ajaxSuccess is a global handler for all ajax calls.
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> it's still async.
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> arc_ your script dealio might be wrapping things in a try/catch to hide those errors from you.
[14:00:25] <hellyeah> i dont know anything about promise btw
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you should learn.
[14:00:44] <taplar_lunch> resolve to learn them.
[14:00:48] <taplar_lunch> heh, see what i did there?
[14:00:51] * taplar_lunch gloats
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> much more flexible than the old success/fail callback paradigm
[14:01:06] <hellyeah> but i dont understand can we deal that situtation with success? may be not
[14:01:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah success/etc are on their way out.
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> and for good reason.
[14:01:31] <hellyeah> ah
[14:01:40] <hellyeah> what is that reason?
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> promises are far more flexible.
[14:03:57] <hellyeah> then i will learn promise i "promise" :D
[14:04:04] <hellyeah> any tips about my problem btw?
[14:04:13] <arc_> the documentation on promises is confusing as hell to me
[14:04:13] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you didn't share any code.
[14:04:23] <robertmaxrees> arc_ they're much easier than you'd think :)
[14:04:32] <arc_> also dude i swear you have been working on datepicker problems for like a year
[14:04:43] <taplar_> at some point in time, they are going to reject, or resolve
[14:04:51] <taplar_> doing error, or success logic as a result
[14:04:58] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i shared but sec :Ä°D
[14:04:58] <robertmaxrees> ^ and one promise can only ever resolve or reject once.
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you didn't.  scrolled back - i don't see the link anywhere
[14:05:39] <hellyeah> arc_:
[14:05:47] <hellyeah> my manager is badass bitch
[14:05:51] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:05:54] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:05:57] <hellyeah> Code is long i am sorry for that can you check line2-274 i couldnt find the error. The thingh i want to do is to click datepicker's title and selec month and open datepicker with  specified month . line 238 for "from" lline 270 for "to" should do that also you can pick different year by slicking dialog's title pls can you help me with that?
[14:05:58] <robertmaxrees> careful there.
[14:06:00] <hellyeah> oh
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah where's the link? ;)
[14:06:09] <hellyeah> forgot to put a link :D:D:D
[14:06:09] <arc_> i don't see a link
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:06:26] <arc_> you linked something like 4 hours ago but idk if it's the same one
[14:06:30] <hellyeah> my fault i am sorry http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/
[14:06:56] <robertmaxrees> so break this down.
[14:07:03] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  he is just mobbing me after 2 years
[14:07:11] <hellyeah> because i did everything there
[14:07:17] <hellyeah> and they just ignored my work
[14:07:18] <robertmaxrees> so break this down: what's your first question?
[14:07:29] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue what you're talking about, but OK.
[14:07:29] <taplar_> i still can't get used to the 'mobbing' word.  i keep thinking of it in the context of agile
[14:07:51] <hellyeah> can be
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> also: this is not a good test case at all.
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> if your isolated test case requires more than 40 or 50 lines of JS, it's not really very well isolated.
[14:09:02] <hellyeah> well when you create datepicker and click datepicker's title list of month will come to you you can pick any month. I expect to see datepicker with spesific month let me show you working example . Calendars are Turkish i am sorry http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/10/
[14:09:52] <taplar_> i keep thinking this functionality already exists
[14:10:06] <hellyeah> it is different in jquery datepicker
[14:10:22] <robertmaxrees> why not just use datepicker's functionality?
[14:10:29] <hellyeah> datepicker has changeMonth and changeYear which offers you drop downs for months and years
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to, like, buy-in halfway to jqui.
[14:10:38] <taplar_> no i know i've see the month popout else where
[14:10:43] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  my manager asked me to do
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> there's a popout version baked in pretty sure.
[14:11:04] <hellyeah> taplar_:  if this functionality exist and will tell me god bless you
[14:11:25] <taplar_> i'm pretty sure i've told you this in the past
[14:11:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:11:35] <robertmaxrees> could always dump through the logs.
[14:12:00] <hellyeah> i dont remember taplar_ i am sorry :/
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah are you having a hard time remembering the things what we show you here?
[14:12:53] <hellyeah> actually no
[14:13:19] <taplar_> not the same, but there is this one: https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year
[14:13:19] <hellyeah> i really cultivated my jquery skills thanks to you guys if i have a hard time to remember i couldnt write that code
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah so why are the dropdowns unacceptable?
[14:13:41] <taplar_> man, where was it
[14:14:04] <hellyeah> taplar_:  yeah i know this one you enable with options changeMonth: true and changeYear: true
[14:14:21] <hellyeah> taplar_:  yeah i know this one you enable with options changeMonth: true and changeYear: true
[14:14:25] <arc_> sounds like managers having an exact specification from which they aren't willing to budge
[14:14:44] <hellyeah> hey
[14:14:48] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[14:15:01] <hellyeah> my manager wants calendar have windows calendar functionality
[14:15:05] <arc_> haha
[14:15:12] <hellyeah> he doesnt want a dropdown i already showed him
[14:15:12] <arc_> yeah that sounds about right
[14:15:34] <hellyeah> really hate him
[14:15:43] <taplar_> got a meeting in a bit, but i'll def try to find it again
[14:15:47] <hellyeah> but i have to do what he asked me to do in order to sue him
[14:15:55] <hellyeah> taplar_:  thankk you
[14:15:55] <taplar_> ?
[14:15:57] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> either way hellyeah so you have a functioning example?
[14:16:52] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/10/ click datepickers title to see month and click dialog title's to see years you can open datepicker with spesific month and year
[14:17:03] <robertmaxrees> great.
[14:17:07] <robertmaxrees> there's your functioning exampke.
[14:17:09] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[14:17:11] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  this is what i did
[14:17:24] <robertmaxrees> if you paste the 1,000 line fiddle i'ma ignore it lol
[14:17:55] <hellyeah> code is fine just that part between 2-274
[14:18:05] <hellyeah> but anyway let me try to make it small
[14:18:53] <arc_> the code is fine, just not 27.3% of 1000 lines
[14:19:36] <hellyeah> what do you mean 27.3% ?
[14:20:12] <arc_> 2-274 is 273 lines. 273 / 1000 * 100 = 27.3%
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:21:02] <taplar_> fk
[14:21:08] <taplar_> all i know how to do is index + 4
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[14:22:13] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[14:22:17] <arc_> i am so confused right now
[14:22:27] <taplar_> callback to yesterday
[14:22:30] <arc_> lol ok
[14:22:39] * hellyeah back to the future
[14:22:53] <hellyeah> can we think callback like back to the future at some point?
[14:25:23] <taplar_> oh, something i wondered yesterday or some time
[14:25:32] <taplar_> why are there two listCalender blocks?
[14:27:51] <hellyeah> taplar_afk:  i will explain later i didnt see two listYear btw
[16:02:39] <taplar> i leave and the room goes quiet.  come on people, :P
[16:06:36] <AwkwardCough> the lynchpin holding all chat together... who knew
[16:07:27] <taplar> who needed to say it, really
[16:10:35] <AwkwardCough> well obviously no one
[16:14:34] <_TWG_> ANyone here ever work with IIS and SSL?
[16:14:45] <_TWG_> Was hoping there would be an IIS channel but I didn't find one.
[16:14:48] <taplar> for a second i read IIS as ISIS
[16:15:57] <_TWG_> LOL
[16:46:32] <Ahrotahntee> and I misread it as ISS
[16:46:39] <Ahrotahntee> good 'ol brains
[16:49:20] <Captain_Ramius> OK, I give up: how do I rein in my HTML form submit when using jQuery AJAX? I've scoured the .ajax() docs and I'm all boggled now.
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're using an event handler, yeah?
[16:50:03] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius
[16:50:48] <Captain_Ramius> I think so. I'm a newbie, so my vocab is a little shaky. (Idea!) Let me throw up a fiddle and I'll show you.
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> perfect ;)
[16:53:11] <Captain_Ramius> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=vkt4yCf4zC
[16:54:22] <Captain_Ramius> I just ripped it straight from my IDE, so I might be missing some connecting parts.
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> event.preventDefault;
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> should be event.preventDefault();
[16:54:35] <taplar> uh, your binding a submit handler when the button is clicked
[16:54:44] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[16:55:04] <Captain_Ramius> Arrrrggghh!!! One day society will collapse and we will trace it all back to one puncuation typo!
[16:55:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4j7jdu9n/1/
[16:55:42] <Captain_Ramius> Well, I had a problem with the form being submitted twice. That was my main  question.
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing things weird.
[16:56:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4j7jdu9n/2/
[16:56:03] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[16:56:15] <Captain_Ramius> It's running twice but I don't know what should be .preventDefault() 'ed and what should have the function call: form or button or both?
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:31] <Captain_Ramius> "because you're doing things weird." I hear that a lot actually.
[16:56:35] <robertmaxrees> function call: form?
[16:56:36] <taplar> you don't prevent anything.  you just don't do it twice
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> so basically, you never use onclick/onchange/whatever.
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> use jquery's .on()
[16:57:18] <Captain_Ramius> So I don't need both onsubmit and onclick? That's what I suspected, but when I remove one or the other, it doesn't do anything (probably because of the missing parens on preventdefault
[16:57:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:57:31] <robertmaxrees> you weren't doing it correctly.
[16:57:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:59:17] <Captain_Ramius> Well, thanks for helping me clean up the mess I made.
[16:59:23] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:59:45] <Captain_Ramius> "you never use onclick/onchange": that's simple enough.
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:59:57] <robertmaxrees> don't put event handlers in your html.
[17:00:00] <taplar> i'm slightly confused.  i didn't thing type="button" would trigger the submit
[17:00:43] <taplar> oh it's bound on the form
[17:00:54] <taplar> but true about the button, right?
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> should be, yeah.
[17:02:08] <Captain_Ramius> I was testing different solutions, hence the .bind() (that I dont' even understand), and who knows what else in there.
[17:02:12] * Captain_Ramius goes to get a mop
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> also: var rowNum = $("body").data("row");
[17:02:30] <robertmaxrees> why
[17:05:44] * Captain_Ramius looks around sheepishly
[17:06:32] <Captain_Ramius> Because this is being translated from the previous version that was written in Google Apps Script
[17:07:18] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:07:55] <Captain_Ramius> I had to store values to use later and I didn't know a better way.
[17:08:20] <Captain_Ramius> I will update that later, but if it works now, I'm going to leave it (it's a business decision, not dev decision).
[17:08:36] <robertmaxrees> business decisions should never have that kind of control over code, but alright.
[17:10:48] <Captain_Ramius> I don't like it either but it's a necessary sacrifice: the kicker is that I am the business decider AND the dev. Talk about conflict of interest!
[17:11:19] <Captain_Ramius> I need it to work: I'm not launching a SaaS and I'm not trying to optimize performance for 1000s of users.
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> neither one of those would have influenced my suggestion to change it but OK.
[17:11:44] <robertmaxrees> :) whatever works.
[17:12:36] <Captain_Ramius> What's your concern with it?
[17:13:01] <Captain_Ramius> (since I can't type in a certain tone) I'm honestly curious.
[17:13:11] <robertmaxrees> i would've just selected the rows and gotten the length of them.
[17:13:38] <Captain_Ramius> from the db table?
[17:13:58] <robertmaxrees> err, is that a reference to a db row?
[17:14:24] <Captain_Ramius> I think you need some context: the "row" in this case is the table row number AKA "id" of the item that was just selected from the input form using Autocomplete.
[17:14:42] <robertmaxrees> that seems strange, but alright.
[17:14:44] <Captain_Ramius> The Autocomplete source is all the rows where Set = X.
[17:15:13] <Captain_Ramius> Short history: I have a db table of inventory items and each item belongs to a certain Lot of items.
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:15:41] <Captain_Ramius> I use "SELECT item_name, upc where Lot_id = X" to Source my Autocomplete
[17:16:12] <Captain_Ramius> Then we are only looking at the items that are in the current Lot of inventory. Each guy processes one lot at a time, that only contains CERTAIN items.
[17:16:38] <Captain_Ramius> Believe me, it gets weirder, but it's a weird business to begin with.
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:16:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not very weird.
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[17:17:49] <Captain_Ramius> If you want to see the whole thing, you can check out my Github repo: I just threw it up there so a friend of mine could do a little peer review.
[17:18:00] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:18:48] <Captain_Ramius> It's up to you how far you go down the rabbit hole, Alice. https://github.com/tree-wizard
[17:18:52] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:19:12] * Captain_Ramius hands robertmaxrees a red pill.
[17:19:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:20:26] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i'm pretty familiar with inventory processors on account of i work for medium-ish ecom company.
[17:20:34] <Captain_Ramius> I already got a 3 page email reply from my buddy showing "areas that may benefit from improvement". I'm open to input.
[17:20:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do free code review ;)
[17:21:41] <Captain_Ramius> No kidding? How bout that? I'm sure this looks like a kindergarten art project then.
[17:21:51] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:27:09] <maxpen> guys
[17:27:24] <maxpen> what am I doing wrong
[17:27:24] <maxpen>  var li = $(".trustworty_reasons ul li").children().length;     var score = $(".trustworthy_reasons score").html("" + li + "/7");
[17:27:32] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[17:27:38] <robertmaxrees> other than <score> isn't an element.
[17:27:42] <maxpen> it says 0
[17:27:50] <maxpen>  0/7
[17:28:10] <maxpen> while it should say 6/7
[17:28:16] <robertmaxrees> then i need a fiddle.
[17:31:20] <maxpen> well alright
[17:31:28] <maxpen> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/sr950f2p/4/
[17:31:52] <maxpen> wait
[17:31:53] <maxpen> https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/sr950f2p/5/
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> maxpen you realize you can't just make up tagnames, right?
[17:32:35] <maxpen> says who lol
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> the w3c and the browsers?
[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> they have no idea how to handle the,m.
[17:32:55] <maxpen> but I style them
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[17:33:01] <maxpen> so they just read the css
[17:33:08] <robertmaxrees> none of them will ever agree on how to use them
[17:33:55] <robertmaxrees> also: <ul> elements can only have <li> as children.
[17:34:46] <maxpen> yea I know
[17:34:52] <maxpen> hence why there is a each
[17:35:04] <maxpen> also http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/
[17:35:08] <robertmaxrees> you actually want a .map() there.
[17:35:12] <robertmaxrees> and you're not using webcomponents.
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> so that's not applicable here ;)
[17:36:08] <maxpen> hmm
[17:36:11] <robertmaxrees> but a big part of your problem is your custom markup.
[17:36:17] <maxpen> ok
[17:36:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sr950f2p/6/
[17:36:20] <maxpen> hmmm
[17:36:26] <robertmaxrees> "<li>[object HTMLUnknownElement]</li>"
[17:36:49] <robertmaxrees> are you pulling in xml from somewhere else and trying to transform that or something?
[17:36:56] <maxpen> well
[17:37:36] <maxpen> I'm using a Wordpress plugin that allows you to define a list of checkboxes and i added for each option <li> but that breaks it so instead I added <trust> and then convert that to li on the clientside
[17:37:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not a good thing to do.
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to at least use valid html.
[17:37:55] <maxpen> I could also add nothing just plain text
[17:38:02] <maxpen> but then how would I target it
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> by using classes?
[17:38:50] <robertmaxrees> why not just output things correctly in the first place?
[17:39:06] <maxpen> the output would be <ul> plain text, plain text, plain text, </ul>
[17:39:14] <robertmaxrees> so wrap them in lis?
[17:39:24] <maxpen> don't know how to taggl
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:39:46] <maxpen> tackle
[17:40:08] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[17:40:57] <rudi_s> Hi. I'm looking for a way to replace (actually surround) some text in a tag with a (jquery) html tag. So e.g. <div>this is a nice text</div> should be changed to <div>this is a <span>nice</span> text</div> - and if possible this should be safe from possible XSS no matter what kind of replacements I perform.
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> rudi_s you can use .html() to get that as  text and then use .replace()
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> XSS protection would be a little funkier.
[17:45:35] <maxpen> robertmaxrees http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6164000/how-can-i-create-my-own-html-tag
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> maxpen *sigh*
[17:46:32] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and ignore me if you want, but that's literally what's causing your problems.
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:47:23] <maxpen> I tried doing it normally
[17:47:23] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: Thanks. - Let's say I use $('<span>').text('nice') to create the tags and then use replace on the outer html. Shouldn't that be XSS-safe?
[17:47:29] <maxpen> no results
[17:47:35] <robertmaxrees> maxpen shoiw me what you tried.
[17:48:09] <robertmaxrees> rudi_s if you want, sure?  not sure why you're letting potentially unsafe user-supplied content that far onto the page.
[17:48:17] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: What?
[17:48:37] <robertmaxrees> rudi_s you should be sanitizing that data.
[17:48:38] <maxpen> https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/sr950f2p/7/
[17:48:44] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: Why and how?
[17:48:59] <rudi_s> (The more important part being the why.)
[17:49:38] <robertmaxrees> because it's overall safer to do it that way.  i'd never trust my frontend enough to let potentially unsafe content out to iut.
[17:50:20] <robertmaxrees> maxpen because you misspelled trustworthy
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> also: you can't put commas after the closing li.
[17:50:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sr950f2p/8/
[17:51:26] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: What exactly do you mean? Let's say I make an AJAX request to get data from the server. Why should the server provide escaped data (which I then can't properly search for example)?
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you making the client-side work harder?
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> have the endpoint do the searching.
[17:51:58] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: And with endpoint you mean?
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> rudi_s the thing you're requesting from.
[17:52:24] <robertmaxrees> the url your ajax call hits is an endpoint.
[17:53:29] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: It's faster. - But my point wasn't the specific operation. If I don't have the "raw" data I can't perform any other action than displaying it.
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you doing want to expose potentially unsafe content to your frontend. period.
[17:53:55] <rudi_s> But I want to do more with it because that's the reason I'm using JavaScript.
[17:54:09] <robertmaxrees> let your backend handle all the sorting and searching.
[17:54:17] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: All right. Don't understand why and how you work with encoded data. But anyway.
[17:54:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't do it client side.
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> let your server handle that.
[17:55:19] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees:So you're telling me that I shouldn't handle user input at all on the client side? I hope you're joking.
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you should do both.  but you should never rely solely on your client-side for it.
[17:55:52] <robertmaxrees> you should prioritize server-side first.
[17:56:07] <rudi_s> If I have to be able to handle untrusted data, why should I do any of the escaping on the server side?
[17:56:20] <rudi_s> Besides that escaping depends on the context where I want to put the untrusted data.
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> because now you're moving all that handling to a place that is much harder to tamper with than the page.
[17:57:08] <rudi_s> But the page does have to handle it anway, e.g. when I want to process user input and the user enters a html tag.
[17:57:30] <robertmaxrees> sure - users aren't going to pwn themselves usually.
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) do what you want, but relying on client-side javascript to sanitize your output to users is something i'd really suggest avoiding.
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> feel free to also have client-side validation.  it's nbd.
[17:58:10] <robertmaxrees> for the record - i advocate for both.
[17:58:23] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: What the hell. It's not about "pwn" but a user writing something which contains a tag.
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> right - so who are you trying to protect in those cases?
[17:58:44] <rudi_s> And you're talking about validation, why should I do any validation? I want to handle the tag, not validate it.
[17:58:56] <robertmaxrees> and also: you can (and still) should sanitize and validate client-side.
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> i can tell you're frustrated; forget i said anything :)
[17:59:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry for bugging you.
[17:59:21] <rudi_s> I want to "protect" the rendering of the page which breaks when a tag is just inserted.
[17:59:43] <robertmaxrees> feel free to use the technique you described above.
[17:59:44] <rudi_s> I'm not frustrated, just confused what you're recommending.
[18:02:36] <maxpen> thank you robertmaxrees
[18:10:10] <IamTrying> https://code.google.com/archive/p/jquery-stream/downloads - I need to handle lot of Stream with jQuery. Can anyone please tell me for 2016 which jQuery stream is upto date with latest jQuery version (they one i reference is very old from 2011 and no updates..)
[18:20:50] <Saul775> I'm trying to find all instances of a checkbox IN a div with a specific id WITH a specific data attribute.  I'm trying this:  $("div#Messages[data-isurgent] :checkbox"), but it isn't working.  Is this the correct syntax?
[18:22:35] <shoky> yes but id's must be unique so "#Messages :checkbox" is enough and better
[18:22:52] <shoky> and if your id's aren't unique - fix that ;]
[18:23:04] <shoky> (use classes instead)
[18:23:19] <shoky> Saul775 ^
[18:24:12] <Saul775> Well, there aren't any IDs for the checkboxes.  Maybe that's why my length is 0?
[18:24:30] <shoky> no
[18:24:33] <Saul775> Oh!  It's been a long day.
[18:24:46] <Saul775> I think it should be div#Messages :checkbox[data-isurgent].
[18:24:48] * Saul775 sighs.
[18:26:53] <Saul775> Thanks for the help, shoky.
[18:31:50] <rudi_s> Can I append text (without interpreting it as HTML) to a html tag? Let's say I have "text <foo>" and "<div></div>" and I want to append the _text_ and get "<div>text &lt;foo&gt;</div>". Is this possible with jquery?
[18:32:10] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and let's play around with it :)
[18:32:52] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: Are you talking to me?
[18:32:56] <robertmaxrees> si .
[18:33:37] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: Then please stop it. That's a legitimate question and if you have nothing to add then please shut up.
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> woah dude.
[18:34:07] <robertmaxrees> no need to get rude.
[18:34:12] <robertmaxrees> just trying to help you.
[18:34:45] <rudi_s> Very helpful indeed.
[18:35:08] <robertmaxrees> i was only providing feedback earlier because you mentioned a concern with XSS.  thjat's all.
[18:35:15] <robertmaxrees> there's absolutely no reason you snap at me :)
[18:35:27] <robertmaxrees> s/you/to
[18:35:28] <b-ot> Correction, <robertmaxrees> there's absolutely no reason to snap at me :)
[18:35:49] <rudi_s> ...
[18:36:49] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw you can use encodeURIcomponent
[18:37:14] <robertmaxrees> or just encodeURI, depending.
[18:37:27] <rudi_s> My question was more if I can append a _text_ to a tag without creating a html tag and append that.
[18:37:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:37:35] <robertmaxrees> absolutely can.
[18:37:36] <rudi_s> How?
[18:37:49] <rudi_s> And with _text_ I mean without it getting interpreted.
[18:38:25] <rudi_s> And encode* sounds dangerous. Every time you have to escape something, your API has issues ..
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> whose api?
[18:39:12] <rudi_s> Any API.
[18:39:29] <taplar> if you use text() you don't have to change _ to & code thing
[18:39:31] <robertmaxrees> that hasn't been my experience, and with jquery that shouldn't really matter, especially since you want to append as text.
[18:39:51] <robertmaxrees> taplar he wants to escape < and > to their entities.
[18:40:10] <taplar> is he wanting to do that because he isn't aware of text nodes?
[18:40:11] <rudi_s> I don't want to escape anything. That's exactly my point. - I want to append it as _text_ without me having to escape it at all.
[18:40:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L8sa6rrj/1/
[18:40:29] <rudi_s> And I know .text() - but I don't know how to append text to a tag.
[18:40:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:40:46] <robertmaxrees> youy have to fetch the preexisting text and then contact onto that manually.
[18:40:52] <rudi_s> $(..).text("foo") works, but how can I do $(..).append(XXX) where XXX is text().
[18:42:16] <rudi_s> But fetching .text() and setting it again will destroy all exs
[18:42:21] <rudi_s> *existing tags.
[18:42:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/L8sa6rrj/3/
[18:43:02] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you have an element whose contents may or may not contain html that you'd like to retain.
[18:43:36] <rudi_s> taplar: Awesome, document.createTextNode what was I was looking for. - Is there a jquery shortcut for this like $('<div>') is shortcut for document.createElement?
[18:43:48] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[18:43:54] <taplar> that's what text() is really
[18:43:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:44:06] <taplar> which works for a whole sell set
[18:44:39] <rudi_s> So I'll have to spell that out each time. Well as long as it works. - Thank you!
[18:44:49] <taplar> first world problems, :)
[18:44:58] <rudi_s> ;-)
[18:45:17] <taplar> you could always write your own little jq extension
[18:45:49] <rudi_s> taplar: How can I do that?
[18:46:17] <robertmaxrees> plugin authoring is pretty easy :) the learning center has a fantastic guide here: https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[18:46:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/L8sa6rrj/5/
[18:47:36] <rudi_s> robertmaxrees: taplar: Thank you.
[18:47:48] <rudi_s> taplar: Why did you use if (this.length) in your snippet?
[18:47:51] <taplar> just be aware your making a custom jquery method that new people will have questions about
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ and it'll be attached to every object made with $()
[18:48:04] <taplar> if nothing is selected, no reason to do the processing
[18:48:42] <rudi_s> taplar: Ah good point.
[18:49:32] <rudi_s> Yeah, that's true. I think I'll just spell it out and don't modify $.fn - but it's good to know for the future, thanks.
[18:49:44] <taplar> :)
[19:31:45] <taplar> boom http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
[19:31:53] <taplar> it was a bootstrap datepicker
[19:32:00] <taplar> i guess, couldn't find the other one i had found
[20:31:26] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[21:01:40] <z1haze> when using bower, how to you require() modules and stuff like you would with npm/browserify ?
