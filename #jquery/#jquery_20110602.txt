[00:08:57] <aaa355> dsgdfgvbcvbcvb
[00:19:12] <MoTiOnXml> when using an anchor that has class on it, this doesn't work: this.element.find("a[data-jsonID]").live("click", function(e) {})
[00:19:26] <MoTiOnXml> only when it's got the data-jsonID and NO class
[00:19:32] <MoTiOnXml> any suggestions?
[00:22:13] <MoTiOnXml> ah
[00:22:18] <MoTiOnXml> i was missing an ending quote
[00:23:48] <izepstan> if i have something like this $.post("shops/showinfo/"+$(this).attr('rel')), how can i specify the target container?
[00:25:37] <fantomas> Hi all. Is it possible to bind Ctrl-click to some action?
[00:27:18] <ndee> hi there, I'm looking at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#categories and was wondering, what's the best way, to make the input field then look like this: http://xoxco.com/clickable/jquery-tags-input . The fields should look like tags.
[00:31:27] <abstrusenick> ndee: that sucks
[00:31:52] <ndee> abstrusenick, what sucks? the tag-ified input field?
[00:31:59] <abstrusenick> http://tagedit.webwork-albrecht.de/index.html
[00:34:56] <ndee> abstrusenick, jup, looks better :D
[00:50:53] <ndee> abstrusenick, the documentation is quite lacking of that plugin :/
[00:52:00] <MoTiOnXml> abstrusenick: nice plugin!
[00:52:11] <abstrusenick> yeah
[01:24:06] <Whirl3d> hello all. Isn't there a jquery command to reverse an animation? Like if you animate something to a position and want it to animate back?
[01:24:24] <fantomas> Hi all. Is it possible to bind Ctrl-click to some action?
[01:25:18] <Whirl3d> fantomas, you would bind control to a handler and click to a handler and see if both events happen.
[01:32:47] <bigos__> hi, if I set a global .ajax({ error:} handler, and then set another handler, just for one request... which one will be used when the request timeouts? Will global handler be overridden?
[01:37:38] <ximi>  the global handler will be overwritten
[01:37:47] <ximi> From the api: All subsequent Ajax calls using any function will use the new settings, unless overridden by the individual calls, until the next invocation of $.ajaxSetup().
[01:49:40] <Graloth> how do i go about submitting a form with its 3rd button via javascript, when all buttons are type="submit" ?
[01:50:12] <Graloth> doing .submit() does not work, as it uses the default form submit, i need it to "click" the 3rd button
[01:50:20] <Graloth> .click() seems to do nothing
[01:51:02] <ximi> click should work, you just need to target that button specifically
[01:51:15] <ximi> ideally assign the 3rd button an unique id
[01:51:31] <Graloth> i have targeted it
[01:51:40] <ximi> and then you $('#myButton').click(function() { // your form submit here });
[01:51:49] <ximi> Do you have an example somewhere?
[01:52:08] <Graloth> i dont think im allowed to show you, but i can go in more detail
[01:52:38] <ximi> Is any error thrown on click?
[01:52:40] <Graloth> basically i have a hidden form, that i need the 3rd button clicked, i need this done by clicking a text link elsewhere on the site
[01:52:41] <Graloth> nope
[01:52:53] <nVee> sup everyone. I'm trying to control a button's disabled function with the keyup of an input. Can anyone please help me? I have the following code: http://pastebin.com/XWimD2fi
[01:53:10] <Graloth> so i have a click() on the text link, and inside that i target the 3rd button, and use .click()
[01:53:30] <Graloth> problem is that nothing happens, and i just get sent to the links link, even when using return false
[01:59:05] <mipo> Hi , I have problem on jquery
[01:59:07] <mipo> this is my code
[02:00:29] <nVee> awesome
[02:00:29] <mipo> http://pastie.org/2007566
[02:00:36] <mipo> anybody can help me?
[02:00:42] <nVee> umm you're kidding me
[02:00:49] <nVee> you're not going to say what the problem is
[02:00:50] <jayflux> how about you explain what your problem is
[02:01:36] <ximi> graloth: so you wanna trigger a click on the third submit button when you click on a link?
[02:01:59] <Graloth> yes
[02:02:12] <Graloth> right now nothing happens and you follow the text link
[02:02:18] <Graloth> even thou it has return false
[02:03:05] <mipo> when I click I a menu , that create a dialog near the menu link
[02:03:07] <mipo> with 3 link
[02:03:18] <mipo> when I click I delete link
[02:03:34] <mipo> I see on that dialog yes/no link
[02:03:51] <mipo> when I click on No link , I see several alert!
[02:04:04] <mipo> but I need just 1 alert!
[02:04:05] <mipo> ok?
[02:04:18] <ximi> check out this, this works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/ximi/8Dyut/
[02:07:14] <mipo> ximi , click function can't work! I should use live function
[02:07:49] <nVee> mipo: Whats with all the "!"?
[02:07:58] <nVee> it's like your shouting at the people trying to help you?
[02:08:19] <ximi> mipo sorry this was actually meant for graloth
[02:08:29] <mipo> ximi , sorry!
[02:09:16] <mipo> nVee , sorry!
[02:11:17] <pahis__> is there a way to check if variable exists or is not null or empty
[02:11:28] <pahis__> * or not empty
[02:11:38] <bigos__> if(variable) ?
[02:12:04] <pahis__> and if its array
[02:13:44] <Hornet> http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/ site seems half-down
[02:13:50] <Hornet> no stylesheets etc
[02:14:33] <Graloth> ximi: that works because it submits the form, i dont want that, i just want the button clicked, since the system that is running this site is listening to clicks on that button to open an overlay, it doesn't listen to form submits
[02:14:52] <bigos__> pahis__: hmm i don't know, first try if it exists, and then check if it has a "length" property... if it does, it's probably an array
[02:15:13] <AdvoWork> i'm using jquery for my tables, and have applied a theme, ive given certain rows a specific class name, so that i can change the background, this does this initially, but once loaded, the theme overwrites it. any ideas how i can have all my table rows the same apart from ones with a certain classname? the td's are getting styled with .ui-widget-content .  any ideas please?
[02:15:53] <bigos__> pahis__: bear in mind that "" is not null nor undefined... so if you check a string for being null or empty, "" will fail that check
[02:16:11] <bigos__> also, empty array is not null/undefined too
[02:16:15] <kephu> hi
[02:16:23] <kephu> anyone here use flexigrid?
[02:16:36] <ximi> graloth, why not open the overlay directly when clicking on the link?
[02:17:25] <Graloth> ximi: i would if i knew how, i have no idea what function is listening much less how to trigger the overlay
[02:17:55] <izepstan> is it possible to assign values to variables inside a function like $(this).qtip({
[02:18:04] <ximi> ok, well you can also do this: http://jsfiddle.net/ximi/8Dyut/
[02:18:42] <ximi> izepstan: of course it is possble
[02:19:36] <Graloth> ximi: sadly did not trigger the overlay, probably because its loaded via ajax or something like that
[02:19:38] <izepstan> it throws a syntax error if i do var clickedfield=$(this).attr('rel')),
[02:20:02] <ximi> it should still trigger it though
[02:20:15] <ximi> I any of the links/buttons inserted dynamically?
[02:20:23] <izepstan> all
[02:20:52] <Graloth> ximi: when the button is manually clicked, it is replaced with a "loading" text & animation untill the overlay appears
[02:20:55] <ximi> can you paste an example to jsfiddle.com ?
[02:21:20] <izepstan> ximi: me or graloth?
[02:21:32] <ximi> ximi: you izepstan
[02:21:36] <izepstan> ok mom.
[02:26:39] <izepstan> ok it doesn't work but you see the functionality http://jsfiddle.net/izepstan/CGcRU/ - i wanna replace all $(this).attr('rel')) with a variable
[02:26:55] <izepstan> the link is normally a dot on a mp
[02:26:56] <izepstan> map
[02:28:00] <izepstan> cause the ajax request on onRender: function()  does not work .attr(rel) is undefined in this moment
[02:29:25] <pahis__> is it possible to use jquery with jsclass? any experience?
[02:31:32] <NL_Ed> Hi All, how can I detect if an Iframe is clicked?
[02:33:21] <pahis__> NL_Ed: try put handler in iframes body and then notify top window
[02:34:00] <NL_Ed> pahis__: I can't that's the only problem, It's using Tinymce so is generated on the fly
[02:34:37] <ximi> izepstan: what does the qtip function do?
[02:35:11] <izepstan> ximi: it displays the information from the hidden divs as a speech bubble
[02:35:20] <zoggy> qtip2
[02:35:37] <izepstan> zoggy: not ready now?
[02:36:39] <ximi> izepstan: you have a parenthesis too much, that's what's throwing the error
[02:36:54] <ximi> it should be var clickedfield=$(this).attr('rel'),
[02:37:03] <ximi> you have one more closing ")" before the ,
[02:38:00] <izepstan> ximi: var clickedfield=$(this).attr('rel'), throws the same error
[02:38:18] <izepstan> Unexpected identifier
[02:38:53] <pahis__> NL_Ed: you can, just pick the richtext container $('my_tinymc') after its rendered and bind eventhandler to this element
[02:39:34] <NL_Ed> pahis__: Example?
[02:40:25] <ximi> could you try to move the statement outside of qtip
[02:40:33] <ximi> within the each loop
[02:42:00] <izepstan> ximi: i tried to avoid this but in this moment it throws me: unexpected token (
[02:42:35] <izepstan> ok my fault
[02:43:11] <izepstan> yeah that works
[02:43:24] <izepstan> but isnt it looped now each time the function is called?
[02:44:11] <izepstan> doesn't matter cpu's are powerfull enough?
[02:46:26] <izepstan> thank you very much ximi, last question why clickedfield.attr('rel') does not work?
[02:47:15] <dytrivedi> guise any jquery plugin that halps to truncate text based on height?
[02:47:17] <izepstan> cause on time i have to get the value from rel from a field wich i referenced with somediv.attr(rel).attr(rel)
[02:47:31] <dytrivedi> and moar importantly, ensures no 'half-cut' lines
[02:47:34] <dytrivedi> ?
[02:48:29] <ximi> izpestan .attr returns a string, not an object. if you want to access the attr of the clickedfield just call clickedfield
[02:49:59] <AdvoWork> i'm using jquery for my tables, and have applied a theme, ive given certain rows a specific class name, so that i can change the background, this does this initially, but once loaded, the theme overwrites it. any ideas how i can have all my table rows the same apart from ones with a certain classname? the td's are getting styled with .ui-widget-content .  any ideas please?

[02:58:13] <nbari> hi all
[02:59:00] <nbari> I created a list (ul/li) from a json input and later placed using the jquery.html() funcition and notice that the browser autocomplete the unclosed </li> or </ul>
[02:59:29] <coldhead> it does that, nbari
[02:59:36] <coldhead> you can't insert invalid html
[02:59:39] <nbari> so wondering it is ok for simplicity to just open or create the necesary ul/ui and let the brower to "autoclose" the tags
[02:59:56] <nbari> so then jquery fix the html ?
[03:00:11] <coldhead> you ARE inserting invalid html
[03:00:17] <coldhead> which is kind of icky
[03:00:24] <coldhead> but if it works, no one can stop you
[03:00:49] <nbari> the part that i like is that the code was automatically clieaned
[03:00:52] <dytrivedi> coldhead: do you have an idea of any such plugin?
[03:01:01] <nbari> but who cleaned? jquery html() orthe browser
[03:01:30] <coldhead> i tend to do it like this: $('<ul />').append('<li />').text('lol').end().appendTo('#somewhere')
[03:01:30] <pahis__> is it possible to use jquery with jsclass? any experience?
[03:01:52] <coldhead> i'm not sure, nbari, probably the browser
[03:02:02] <nbari> ok
[03:02:05] <dytrivedi> hmm there is one, but for width
[03:02:05] <dytrivedi> http://web5.me/jquery/plugins/shorten/shorten.doc.html
[03:02:11] <AdvoWork> Xaevo, but where does my class "exact_class" go into that?
[03:02:19] <coldhead> that stuff is kind of a nightmare, dytrivedi
[03:02:23] <coldhead> do you really have to do it?
[03:02:46] <Xaevo> AdvoWork: change the classes with jQuery i think
[03:03:17] <Xaevo> eg .class1 tr:nth-child(even)
[03:03:30] <dytrivedi> naah coldhead, I'm just checking if there's somethin'
[03:03:44] <dytrivedi> can straight away decline client
[03:03:55] <coldhead> dytrivedi: i've never seen anything do it right
[03:04:44] <coldhead> ?source html
[03:04:45] <bot-t> Line#5194 - "html: function( value ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5194
[03:04:47] <dytrivedi> aww
[03:13:15] <pahis__> how to typecheck a string e.g. isString('asdf') => true
[03:13:52] <ximi> izepstan: that won't work because $(this).attr('rel') returns a string
[03:14:17] <izepstan> ximi: but before i used the var it worked...
[03:14:31] <pahis__> there is no way to check that variable is a string? cool.
[03:14:33] <ximi> yes, you will still need to use the var
[03:14:59] <ximi> pathis___ with typeof
[03:15:03] <izepstan> hmm
[03:15:09] <tra> pahis__: typeof yourVar == 'string'
[03:15:24] <laga> morning guys. i want to do an XMLHttpRequest and work with the XML that's returned, DOM-style. problem: the server is returning tag soup, not valid XML. any way i can easily turn the tag soup into a DOM with jquery?
[03:15:38] <g0rd0n> is it possible to select a specific jqueryui Tab based on the anchor in the url? for example http://localhost/#tab2

[03:24:25] <josemota> hi guys, I'm looking for a file uploader that won't use flash. I've tried like 10, none of them is good enough. Uploadify is the best one so far but it screws my sessions up with Java on the server-side. Does anyone have any suggestion? Thank you.
[03:25:53] <coldhead> josemota: this is very popular lately https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[03:28:09] <AdvoWork> Xaevo, struggling a little, ive basically got some rows with <tr class="exact_match"> and some are just <td> i only want to change the background of the exact_match so how would i adapt that?
[03:28:49] <Anthraxium-64> .exact_match tr:nth-child(even) ?
[03:30:03] <AdvoWork> and thats in css rather than js code?
[03:33:49] <jayflux> anyone here use flot graphs?
[03:34:18] <raver> any idea why this simple code refuses to work in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/HRfm2/
[03:35:31] <AdvoWork> Anthraxium-64, so is that just in the jquery code? or does it have to go in my .css fike
[03:35:41] <Anthraxium-64> css
[03:45:10] <josemota> coldhead: will try it. thank you very much :)
[03:47:15] <AdvoWork> Anthraxium-64, ive got .exact_match tr:nth-child(even) {background-color:#06F;} in my css, and ive reloaded the page, and its not changed the background colour at all, any ideas?
[03:49:38] <Anthraxium-64> AdvoWork: i don't know then, sorry =[
[03:50:04] <Anthraxium-64> maybe try odd instead of even
[03:50:11] <Anthraxium-64> nth-child(odd)
[03:55:29] <AdvoWork> Anthraxium-64, nope, unfortunately that didnt work either
[03:55:30] <juha____> BUTTTEEERRR
[03:55:53] <AdvoWork> but i dont see it even change the colour before everything is done, previously i could see the tr background change, then when the page was fully loaded it was overwritten
[03:56:13] <userfriendly> has one of you used jqGrid before? I'm having the problem that some ID attributes are duplicate when I feed two instances of jqGrid on the same page (from two different tables)
[03:57:40] <depex> can someone point me in the right direction for hiding a div if it overflowes. so if some of the div is outside the wrapper the enire div should be hidden
[03:58:10] <nbari> I was trying to display an ordered list using ul/li tags and also on a select box but until I change the broser from crhome to firefox, notice that chrome doest not properl order the items
[03:58:17] <AdvoWork> Anthraxium-64, this is how the table is setup: http://pastebin.com/p0tcsnDQ
[03:58:25] <nbari> is this a bug on crhome or is there a way to give a turn to that ?
[03:59:31] <Anthraxium-64> sadly dunno alot about jQuery, i know more about CSS, and i assumed it was a css defect instead of jQuery
[04:02:55] <AdvoWork> in that case, if ive got: $('td', table).addClass('ui-widget-content');  how can i say td for that table but for one with the class "exact_match" ?
[04:05:18] <AdvoWork> fek, this works: $('.exact_match td', table).addClass('exact_match'); but again when the page has fully loaded it overwrites it :(
[04:06:08] <theotherguy> how can i scroll a overflow:auto div to its end?
[04:08:10] <AdvoWork> got it, wootoot
[04:08:38] <fantomas> Whirl3d: how to see what keys were pressed inside a handler?
[04:08:54] <AdvoWork> $('td:not(".exact_match")', table).addClass('ui-widget-content'); got it
[04:24:28] <pdelgallego> Hi, that anyone knows if there is any plugin to show youtube videos the way facebook does. I mean a thumb image and when the user click in the image them the video start playing.
[04:31:01] <timing_> is there a cdn providing jquery ui themes?
[04:47:25] <nVee> I'm stuck with a little issue. I have a content slider of which 1 slide has a input box, on the click on the confirm button, the next screen should show the value of the input box. I have assigned that value within a function but how do I print it when the next screen pops up?
[04:55:22] <rns> is it typical to detect the users screen resolution and change the layout as needed?
[04:56:13] <Ron1> hi all, where should I ask my question?
[04:56:40] <ximi> Ron1: just post it here and we'll do the best we can to help you out
[04:57:08] <ximi> rns: you might wanna look into css3 media queries. Other than that I wouldn't say it is typical, but it is certainly not a bad idea
[04:58:41] <Ron1> ok, I have a Div element which id is changed upon click
[04:58:42] <Ron1> $('div#test_$ui').click(function()Â {Â $.ajax({Â type:Â 'POST',Â url:Â 'vacations2.php',data:Â 'e=true',success:Â function(msg){
[04:58:43] <Ron1> $('#test_$ui').html('Final Approve').attr('id','test2_$ui')
[04:58:43] <Ron1> }
[04:58:43] <Ron1> });
[04:58:43] <Ron1> returnÂ false;});
[04:58:47] <Ron1> and this works
[04:59:09] <Ron1> my problem is that I need to then click that same DIV, and it is not recognizing the new DIV ID
[05:00:12] <Ron1> so the whole cycle which I am trying to make work now is:
[05:00:16] <Ron1> $('div#test_$ui').click(function() { $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: 'vacations2.php',data: 'e=true', success: function(msg){
[05:00:16] <Ron1> $('#test_$ui').html('Final Approve').attr('id','test2_$ui')
[05:00:16] <Ron1> }
[05:00:16] <Ron1> });
[05:00:16] <Ron1> return false;});
[05:00:17] <Ron1> $('div#test2_$ui').click(function() { $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: 'vacations2.php',data: 'e=true1', success: function(msg){
[05:00:17] <Ron1> $('#test2_$ui').attr('id','test_$ui').html('Approve');
[05:00:18] <Ron1> }
[05:00:18] <Ron1> });
[05:00:19] <Ron1> return false;});
[05:00:26] <Ron1> but the second snippet is not being executed

[05:04:12] <coldhead> why are you asking in #jQuery then!
[05:04:15] <nbari> how to make google chrome to display  an sorted alphabetically select box ?
[05:04:15] <mahen23> nVee: document.Write
[05:04:26] <mahen23> coldhead: #javascript is dead
[05:04:27] <nVee> $(".className").document.write("like this?");
[05:04:36] <mahen23> ah

[05:05:21] <Graloth> Does anyone have any recommendations for a simple javascript count-down, that counts down the days, hours etc. untill a specific date?
[05:05:36] <mahen23> Graloth: google?
[05:05:54] <r3x> guys i really need some help im getting nuts with IE7
[05:05:55] <Graloth> i have, founds tons, just wanted to know if anyone inhere could recommend one
[05:05:56] <r3x> http://pastie.org/2008157
[05:05:57] <VectorX> hi, anyone seen a script out there to do this, i want to display a count up of numbers, from 0 to 10, so if the value to be shown is 5, it will go 0,1,2,3,4,5 but there will be like a fade effect or something between showing the numbers and will happen real fast ?
[05:06:06] <r3x> this code works on IE8 or any other browser
[05:06:15] <r3x> has someone been through this
[05:06:18] <r3x> ?
[05:06:20] <juha____> i just washed my pussy
[05:06:26] <juha____> it's super angry
[05:07:35] <r3x> the issue is -- when you .load() content with elements that should also trigger the .load() they just dont' work
[05:07:42] <r3x> even calling the function again
[05:07:47] <r3x> only on IE7
[05:07:57] <r3x> has anyone went through this?
[05:08:32] <ximi> ron1: use live for your second event
[05:08:39] <r3x> please have a look: http://pastie.org/2008157
[05:08:53] <Ron1> ximi, I tried...but no success

[05:09:30] <r3x> pleeeaaase...
[05:09:32] <r3x> :)
[05:09:35] <ximi> Ron1: do $('div#test2_$ui').live('click', function() { // your code });
[05:10:04] <mahen23> coldhead: awesome dude, thanks a lot
[05:10:32] <HLHLHL> Hey, anyone knows when jquery 1.6.2 will be released? I am waiting for the fix of the "elem.getElementsByTagName" exception.
[05:10:46] <owzzz> Hi guys, Im trying to add another input box when a certain select box value is chosen.. this all works great using a standard drop down... but my problem is, I'm using a select box jquery library to style up the select box..
[05:11:02] <coldhead> HLHLHL: is it on github?
[05:11:13] <coldhead> you can build it yourself and use that while you wait
[05:11:14] <owzzz> because of this I cannot fire the .change event on the layered select element
[05:11:16] <coldhead> or use the nightly
[05:11:29] <owzzz> any idea how I would go about doing this? here is an example of the form using it: http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/free-your-bike
[05:11:30] <HLHLHL> ColdHead: Didn't notice
[05:12:14] <HLHLHL> Coldhead: Do you have a fix for this issue?
[05:12:43] <coldhead> i am unaware of it, HLHLHL, sorry
[05:13:03] <coldhead> i'll see what i can find out, until i get bored
[05:13:17] <HLHLHL> coldhead: :) thanx
[05:13:56] <Ron1> ximi: work,s thanks a TON!
[05:14:58] <coldhead> HLHLHL: is it marked as fixed here? http://bugs.jquery.com/search?q=getelementsbytagname&go=&ticket=on
[05:15:39] <HLHLHL> Yeah I know, it's said that it will be release with 1.6.2. this is why I asked when 1.6.2 will be released :)
[05:17:47] <coldhead> HLHLHL: it it should be fixed here while you wait: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[05:18:40] <coldhead> HLHLHL: looks like there are only 2 bugs blocking 1.6.2 http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&group=status&milestone=1.6.2
[05:19:03] <coldhead> so ask rwaldron or timmywil to hurry up :)

[05:23:32] <kataire> Is there a non-jQueryUI library compatible with jQuery that provides the same basic interactions (e.g. sorting, drag & drop, selection)?
[05:50:34] <WintermeW> hi ppl...got a question that will probably look lame but i have no idea about how to achieve this, and google gave me unclear results..how i pass extra parameters to callback function, without the function signature being broken ?
[05:51:08] <kataire> Wasn't there a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {...})?

[06:00:31] <teflonpanne> Hi, can anyone please help me with the ScrollTo script? I'm having some issues
[06:00:34] <ximi> AdvoWork: do $('#field').text();
[06:00:47] <ximi> letsgojuno: what exactly is the problem?
[06:01:00] <ximi> katarie: shorthand is: $(function() { });
[06:01:34] <AdvoWork> ximi, thanks

[06:06:33] <BlaDe^> can I get the site of a file which is in an <input type="file" /> ?
[06:07:39] <teflonpanne> No one can help?
[06:09:07] <shaggy_> JQUERY HATES ME! CAPS!!!1
[06:10:33] <jayflux> im quite sure that isnt true
[06:10:42] <teflonpanne> You're not alone
[06:11:15] <teflonpanne> Jayflux, you have any knowledge of the ScrollTo script?
[06:11:29] <jayflux> nope sorry
[06:12:26] <teflonpanne> I just can't make it scroll to my desired anchor, but only 50%, so that it scroll to the middle of the anchor, not placing it at the very top of page
[06:14:07] <AdvoWork> is there a better way than doing: if($('#actual'+id).val() == "") { ?
[06:14:14] <mahen23> anyone can tell me how do i generate random variable names in javascript?
[06:14:21] <mahen23> like var 121212
[06:14:23] <mahen23> var 343434
[06:14:51] <mahen23> i tried concatenating with a random number, did not work
[06:15:24] <WintermeW> with FF4/5 Beta JS Engine, it seems that the onmouseout events aren't triggered if you pass with your mouse very quickly through the object which have the event. has anybody else experienced this behaviour ?
[06:15:52] <Ron1> mahen23: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp
[06:16:25] <mahen23> how do you generate random variables name with that?
[06:16:32] <mahen23> eval it
[06:17:06] <Ron1> generate it, then set is with .attr
[06:17:44] <mahen23> Ron1: i think you are confused about my problem
[06:17:45] <Ron1> .attr('var_name','generated_random_variable')
[06:17:57] <Ron1> ok, sorry then :)
[06:21:33] <t4nkd> Hey jQ, just wondering, for an if statement, is it better to ask if( $(this).is(':checked') ) or if( $(this).attr('checked', true) ) ??
[06:22:50] <Anitox> this.checked ?
[06:23:14] <Dravekx> can someone tell me why I can't see the progress bar here? http://dravekx.dyndns.org/index2.html

[06:25:39] <mazzachre> Hi, I have this problem... I have made an object to keep track of some data elements from my backend, I need to display some select information form this dataset in a table, no problem, however I also want to be able to edit the elements, so I have deviced a dialog (jQueryUI) with the fields to be edited and a way to populate it from the object, however I would like to be able to make the function that initiates the editing inside th
[06:25:39] <mazzachre> e object I use to create the object, but how do I do that? I really want to reference the "this" object of the object that calls $('something').bind('click', ???); how do I do that? Is it even possible?
[06:29:22] <mazzachre> Or must I do the binding outside the scope of the object where I have the refference to the instance? As in $('something').bind('click', function() {myObject.populateWindow(this);}); ?
[06:36:23] <Jon47> mazzachre, the second one would always work
[06:36:26] <nVee> i have a pretty weird question. When making a ajax call through jQuery, is the php file being "included" into the current working scope or is it literally calling it outside of the current project? Will I need to setup my database connection in the php file although I have an active connection in my current project state?
[06:36:28] <Jon47> but you might want to read into this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[06:39:37] <mazzachre> Jon47: Hmmm, ya... would it work as function myObject(){$('someElement').bind('click', $.proxy(this.doSomething, this)); doSomething = function() {alert("Something!")}); ?
[06:40:15] <Jon47> I actually haven't used it yet, but i bookmarked it when i was researching something similar to what you're doing
[06:40:21] <Jon47> good luck!
[06:41:48] <Diverdude> Hello. I am trying to find the jquery validation plugin. Here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation   I dont see anywhere to download it. IS there a special way to download it?
[06:41:50] <mazzachre> OK, I will check it out... I guess I loose the refference to the element being clicked though...
[06:42:37] <Anitox> Diverdude, click the link at the top
[06:42:47] <Anitox> « Back to the jQuery Validation Plugin page
[06:42:56] <Diverdude> Anitox, which one?
[06:43:05] <Diverdude> ahh
[06:47:28] <khurram> ximi:  it works with the version 1.5

[07:02:46] <hlveheart> Quick question guys, what would hte jquery $.browser.version.slice be for Firefox 4.0.1?
[07:02:48] <hlveheart> o_0
[07:04:02] <hlveheart> I have
[07:04:02] <hlveheart> <script>if ( $.browser.mozilla && $.browser.version.slice(0,4) == "2.0" ) {$('#vff').css("display","none");}</script>
[07:04:14] <hlveheart> Right now, and that was for Firefox 4. after 4.0.1 came out it broke
[07:04:20] <juha____> everyone has aids
[07:04:28] <hlveheart> I blame tornados in the north east.
[07:04:30] * hlveheart grins
[07:04:50] <systemfault> Eww, browser testing
[07:05:01] <hlveheart> i know :(
[07:05:17] <hlveheart> Stupid link displays differently on FF4, then it does on FF3, and IE
[07:05:20] <juha____> i blame you.
[07:05:26] <hlveheart> I do blame me, too.
[07:05:35] <hlveheart> so can anyone helpz%
[07:05:43] <hlveheart> i'll be your manslave?
[07:06:16] <dr0id> hey
[07:06:18] <hlveheart> just need to know what would make that ^ up there trigger for FF 4.0.1 :(
[07:06:19] <dr0id> jquery isn't a js lib
[07:06:21] <dr0id> its a js framework
[07:06:26] <hlveheart> I understand that.
[07:06:37] <juha____> hlveheart: will there be a promise of cheezburger or delicious cake?
[07:06:45] <dr0id> dam
[07:06:46] <dr0id> http://net.tutsplus.com/quizzes/nettuts-quiz-jquery-basics/
[07:06:51] <dr0id> I got question 1 and 10 wrong :(
[07:06:57] <dr0id> Good enough to be a NazgÃ»l, I guess. You scored 86.67%
[07:06:59] <dr0id> :(
[07:06:59] <phlp> hlveheart: did you try .slice(0,3)
[07:07:06] <hlveheart> You can haz all the cheezburgets and super delicious cake that never was that you want!
[07:07:10] <hlveheart> thanks, trying. :P
[07:07:29] <hlveheart> that did it!
[07:07:33] <hlveheart> Thank you very much.
[07:07:34] <phlp> ?js "2.0.1".slice(0,4)
[07:07:39] <hlveheart> How come it goes backwards?
[07:07:41] <juha____> so, no cake for me?
[07:07:49] * hlveheart gives juha____ a HUGE delicious cake.
[07:07:57] <juha____> <3
[07:08:00] <hlveheart> :) <3
[07:08:14] <hlveheart> How come with a version increase, the number in the slice goes down?
[07:08:23] <hlveheart> I know that's probably a stupid question, just curious
[07:08:41] <juha____> slice removes element from array
[07:08:45] <phlp> it doesnt.. "2.0.1".slice(0,4) == "2.0." but since it was 2.0 before you never knew it
[07:08:57] <juha____> no wait, i have no idea what the question was
[07:09:15] <hlveheart> what does 2.0 declare though?
[07:09:24] <hlveheart> That does NOT effect FF3, etc?
[07:10:17] <AzaToth> dr0id: "You e awesome enough to just walk into Mordor, aren't you? You scored 100%"
[07:10:27] <dr0id> :(
[07:11:09] <juha____> one does not simply walk into mordor, one takes the cab
[07:11:29] * hlveheart looks around
[07:20:59] <amikrop> Hello, how can I change a variable I have declared somewhere outside, in a success $.ajax callback function?
[07:21:54] <Anitox> just set it inside the callback function
[07:22:41] <amikrop> Anitox: I did so, but turned out "undefined" when I checked it out of the function
[07:23:08] <netAction> If I have $(element).click(function() { ... }); and then hide() and show() again the element, click does not work any longer. Why?
[07:23:15] <amikrop> hmm, maybe I need to make the ajax call synchronous because it doesn't get the response quick enough
[07:24:43] <amikrop> Anitox: hmm no, that didn't work either
[07:25:15] <amikrop> Anitox: I set the variable inside the success callback function but the value of the outside variable does not change...
[07:25:19] <mightym> hey guys, can someone recommend me a good template engine for jquery/javascript?
[07:30:46] <fealls`work> is the issue with slowness of add() in IE7/8 being worked on? http://jsperf.com/jquery-add-performance-2
[07:32:19] <fealls`work> 1.6 scores 5ops/sec in IE8, 1.4.2 scores 88, both are still very very slow
[07:40:00] <TylerE> Grr. Why can't I get this stupid autocomplete to work? I don't get any js errors...
[07:45:48] <VectorX> hi, anyone seen a script out there to do this, i want to display a count up of numbers, from 0 to 10, so if the value to be shown is 5, it will go 0,1,2,3,4,5 but there will be like a fade effect or something between showing the numbers and will happen real fast ?
[07:46:26] <netAction> VectorX: Do it yourself, it is easy.
[07:46:59] <netAction> You have to use setTimeout
[07:47:16] <VectorX> netAction i havent done jquery in a long time, and looking for an example i can work off of
[07:47:44] <VectorX> hopefully you can see the effect i am going for, it basically needs to chane within like a sec or 1.5 secs
[07:47:56] <VectorX> really fast bam in your face sort of thing
[07:48:42] <Jon47> VectorX I will write it for you for $100
[07:50:08] <VectorX> good one Jon47
[07:50:33] <netAction> Is it possible to get a click event before a blur event?
[07:50:43] <nVee> what is the difference between using load() and get() for ajax in jquery?
[07:51:21] <nbari> via json i get this data: http://pastebin.com/uQQgGehu the one I use to create a select menu, but just notice that google crhome doest not respect the order of the list, is there a way arround to this ?
[07:51:24] <nbari> or it a bug on crhome ?
[07:51:42] <netAction> nVee: get() has nothing to do with ajax.
[07:51:58] <netAction> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:52:15] <nVee> netAction: hmmmm... I want to assign my returned ajax call to a variable and not to a div or class
[07:52:18] <nbari> also notice that some select boxes are not order alphabetically like suposed to be but this only happends with crhome browser not firefox/safary
[07:52:36] <netAction> nVee: getJson
[07:52:38] <nVee> did obviously does not work: var result = html(loadUrl).load(loadUrl, "id=1");
[07:52:57] <Jon47> I think he's thinking of $.get (the global function) rather than .get (the method)
[07:53:21] <nVee> haha sorry i guess its no secret that i am spanking new to jquery
[07:53:37] <VectorX> yeah the cats out of the bag
[07:55:34] <Jon47> nVee, the basic difference (which is further explained here: http://api.jquery.com/load/) is that load will automatically replace the html contents of the matched elements with the response message of the XHR, whereas $.get (a wrapper for $.ajax) will not inherently do anythign with the response - it's up to you to define your own success or error functions
[07:56:59] <nVee> Jon47: thank you :) So for my request (I need to either just get a true or false from the ajax call) $.get is the way to go? :P
[07:57:06] <Jon47> sounds like it
[07:57:12] <matschaffer> anyone here used history.js + jquery? On IE if I navigate away then click back, the page state doesn't reload automatically. I was hoping for an automagic onload handler
[07:57:54] <AdvoWork> how can i simulate clicking a href link, but in code instead?
[07:58:19] <phlp> $('a').click();
[08:00:23] <AdvoWork> phlp, will that work if ive got a click function already, but i need to simulate what would happen if the user clicked the link, ie goto http://...idex.php etc ?
[08:01:42] <Jon47> AdvoWork, yes that will initiate the "click" event on the element, which will fire off the event and trigger all its associated handlers
[08:02:45] <Jon47> it's a thin wrapper for .trigger('click')
[08:02:50] <imanc> how can I stick a red border around a field in jquery?
[08:02:51] <Jon47> if you want to read more about the method
[08:03:32] <Jon47> imanc use .css http://api.jquery.com/css/
[08:03:46] <imanc> ah perfect
[08:04:25] <AdvoWork> Jon47, the thing is, im constructing the url within my function based on various input fields data if that makes sense?
[08:04:33] <Jon47> sure
[08:04:37] <Jon47> that shouldn't be a problem
[08:04:51] <Jon47> the DOM changes all the time, jquery is hip to it
[08:05:29] <phlp> AdvoWork: window.location = href;
[08:05:53] <AdvoWork> for example function .... () { // get variable, // get another var,  url = .... + var + var etc etc, so in my function ive got this constructed url,so would i have to update my a href with that url? or can i bypass it?
[08:06:55] <Jon47> it's your call, if you just want to change the URL right then, then do what phlp said, if you want the new href to persist in your a tag, then use $yourLink.attr('href', url) to set it
[08:07:38] <greg_f> I have group of chaeckboxes, which event should I use to get if any was checked/unchecked?
[08:08:34] <Jon47> greg_f I *believe* "change" will work on checkboxes, but you'd have to check that
[08:09:01] <greg_f> Jon47: thanks, will try

[08:14:09] <Qantourisc> .hide on the other hand DOES work ...
[08:16:29] <phlp> Qantourisc: are you using a print stylesheet? maybe it defines that class?
[08:17:01] <Qantourisc> phlp: no, but maybe it's a weird bug, sec you gave me an idea
[08:17:46] <Qantourisc> phlp: nea not it, the weird thing is, hide does work

[08:19:46] <mcfletch-jazinga> Jquery Mobile question: how would I prevent JQM from styling a particular input (a type="image" one)?  I'd like the button to just show up as a regular image input.
[08:19:50] <Qantourisc> phlp: can i use jquery in print preview ? :)
[08:20:21] <Qantourisc> phlp: i mean firebug
[08:21:18] <nickelnick> yo peeepz
[08:21:20] <phlp> no but it shouldnt matter print preview should show the state of the page (except maybe backgrounds) exactly as it is unless you have a print stylesheet
[08:21:50] <nickelnick> i'm wondering...is there a way to do something with .live where the eevent is onblur?
[08:22:32] * nickelnick waves to Adam
[08:23:41] <agbeladem> Okay anybody here ?
[08:23:47] <nickelnick> I am
[08:23:53] <nickelnick> whats be up
[08:26:07] <jmsole> hey guys
[08:26:11] <jmsole> I have a question
[08:26:48] <agbeladem> nickelnick: I'm using ajax to load an external page. Firefox's console tells me it has been loaded with code 200, but jquery returns a 0 statusCod in error function
[08:26:48] <jmsole> $("a").click(function() {
[08:26:48] <jmsole>             window.open("/emails", "Email Text", "scrollbars=no,width=300,height=200");
[08:26:48] <jmsole>         });   this is not working, any ideas?
[08:26:54] <Qantourisc> phlp: it's the background-style not beeing applied it seems
[08:27:46] <necromancer> hey i
[08:27:46] <phlp> Qantourisc: that's normal for printing. no one wants to print your black background and waste all their ink
[08:28:02] <jmsole> can anyone help me?
[08:28:33] <Qantourisc> phlp: what would be "normal" is peaple setting there background to white in in the css :)
[08:28:48] <Qantourisc> phlp: but that's a pipedream :)
[08:28:52] <Qantourisc> hell i don't even do it :)
[08:28:59] <Qantourisc> in any case, in this case i want it :p
[08:29:19] <jmsole> please :( anyone?
[08:29:37] <viscious> jsmole: when you says its not working, what do you mean
[08:29:51] <jmsole> well when i click on a link, nothing happens
[08:29:52] <ajpiano> jmsole: you have to prevent the default action of the <a>
[08:30:04] <le_coeur> How can I trigger click event in jQuery for 10 times with 1s delay?
[08:30:06] <ajpiano> jmsole, do you have your code in a $(document).ready(function() {}); block
[08:30:14] <jmsole> does it need to be?
[08:30:18] <ajpiano> ?mdc setInterval @ le_coeur
[08:30:19] <ajpiano> jmsole yes
[08:30:23] <mcfletch-jazinga> for reference in the logs/docs: add data-role="none" to the button you do not want styled
[08:30:38] <le_coeur> set interval makes only one click
[08:30:38] <le_coeur> setInterval($("#next").click(), 1000);
[08:30:58] <ajpiano> le_coeur, you have to pass a fucntion reference to it, not just the body of a function
[08:31:00] <le_coeur> or I have use it wrong?
[08:31:01] * nickelnick apologizes, was busy typing up an email.
[08:31:15] <ajpiano> setInterval(function() {  $("#next").click();  },1000)
[08:31:23] <ajpiano> but you would need more logic in there to make it kill itself after 10 times
[08:31:42] <Qantourisc> jmsole: do you have a javascript console/debugger ?
[08:31:48] <jmsole> firebug
[08:31:52] <le_coeur> yeap it works
[08:31:53] <le_coeur> thanks
[08:31:55] <jmsole> but it reports no errrors
[08:31:57] <jmsole> errors
[08:31:57] <phlp> setInterval($("#next").click,1000)
[08:32:04] <Qantourisc> jmsole: try alert to see if it is ran at all
[08:32:09] <jmsole> ok
[08:32:15] <phlp> should do it, it only calls once because you are calling it and sending setInterval the result
[08:32:35] <nickelnick> agbel: still there?
[08:32:50] <jmsole> I guess it's not running
[08:32:54] <jmsole> alert won't even work
[08:33:12] <ajpiano> jmsole, that's cause it's not in a document ready block or otherwise running when the dom is actually available
[08:33:16] <nickelnick> agbel: just because the page loaded, doesn't mean there was success in the return
[08:33:43] <nickelnick> or maybe im not followig
[08:33:53] <jmsole> i put it in the document ready block
[08:34:04] <jmsole>  $(document).ready(function() {
[08:34:04] <jmsole>         	$("a").click(function() {
[08:34:04] <jmsole>             	alert("test");
[08:34:04] <jmsole>             	// window.open("/emails", "Email Text", "scrollbars=no,width=300,height=200");
[08:34:04] <jmsole>         	});
[08:34:05] <jmsole>         });
[08:34:11] <ajpiano> jmsole http://jsfiddle.net/dkM29/
[08:34:25] <ajpiano> jmsole, use a pastebin, don't paste a lot of code into an IRC channel
[08:34:28] <ajpiano> ?p
[08:34:37] <ajpiano> botty :(
[08:34:40] <nickelnick> adam, yo brotha! riddle me this.....is there a way to do a .live() onblur event?
[08:34:47] <jmsole> im sorry
[08:34:55] <nickelnick> i dont see it listed as one of the events...
[08:35:04] <nickelnick> im guessing there might be a way round that
[08:35:08] <ajpiano> nickelnick, i *think* - what version of jquery are you on
[08:35:24] <nickelnick> double checking
[08:36:18] <phlp> "As of jQuery 1.4.1 even focus and blur work with live (mapping to the more appropriate, bubbling, events focusin and focusout)." http://api.jquery.com/live
[08:36:27] <nguyendh> question @ http://pastebin.com/fezvcrNh
[08:36:48] <nickelnick> 1.5.2
[08:36:51] <agbeladem> nickelnick: sorry
[08:36:53] <ajpiano> nguyendh: what is your quesiton
[08:37:01] <ajpiano> you can tell which thing clicked it by getting the class of this
[08:37:10] <agbeladem> nickelnick: well firefox returns a 200 code which basically means "success"
[08:37:11] <ajpiano> $(this).hasClass("year")
[08:37:45] <nickelnick> talking to me  "$(this).hasClass("year")" ?
[08:38:01] <nickelnick> i didnt think so but
[08:38:03] <nguyendh> ajpiano, i c. if i use $(this).hasClass('year'). i can have a if statement in it. thanks
[08:38:09] <nickelnick> ok nevm
[08:38:17] <ajpiano> yep
[08:38:37] <nickelnick> adam: dude im retarded.....not onblur
[08:38:40] <nickelnick> onload
[08:38:43] <ajpiano> lol
[08:38:44] <ajpiano> no
[08:38:52] <ajpiano> i don't think anyone has figured that out
[08:38:58] <nickelnick> fak
[08:39:42] <danyk2099> Hello, can anybody help me with a Fancybox issue?
[08:39:50] <nickelnick> is there maybe a work around you can think of?
[08:40:04] <nickelnick> i'm not wanting to put this validation instantiation on every page
[08:40:14] <g0rd0n> maybe this is a javascript question but... i have a variable containing the string "ABC123", is there an easy way to extract just the numeric part of it?
[08:40:16] <nickelnick> rather, would like the class to just be picked up
[08:40:19] <g0rd0n> so that i would get 123
[08:40:36] <nickelnick> but needs to do an initial validation on page load...then any onblur/focusout etc
[08:40:44] <ajpiano> nickelnick: you're talking to me like i have any context of what your'e trying to do
[08:40:51] <nickelnick> haha my bad
[08:41:29] <nguyendh> is it a good practice to declare every js variable b4 assign a value to it ?
[08:41:46] <ajpiano> yes
[08:42:04] <nguyendh> thanks
[08:42:06] <fealls`work> is the issue with slowness of add() in IE7/8 being worked on? http://jsperf.com/jquery-add-performance-2
[08:42:28] <agbeladem> nickelnick: okay I'm seriously stuck
[08:42:34] <jay252> Is it possible to iterate over the event attributes of an element? If I wanted to iterate over an element to see which event attributes are set such as onclick, onchange, is this possible without prior knowledge of all the event attribute names?
[08:43:11] <nickelnick> so heres the thing....we need to validate the forms that load with both jquerymobile and our nonmobile site without changing much, and without adding a script line to initialize it on each page...so that it checks at the page load also
[08:43:26] <orolo> can i set the 'event.Target' and pass it into a function?
[08:43:49] <ajpiano> orolo: you can straight up just mock an event object by doing {target: someDomElement}
[08:44:09] <ajpiano> jay252, yes, every element has an attributes property
[08:44:13] <ajpiano> you should be able to iterate that
[08:44:15] <orolo> ajpiano: ah.
[08:44:17] <Hashmed> Upgraded from 1.5 to 1.6.1 and the ajzax start function through an error.     $().ajaxStart($("#loading").show());        works but        $("#something").ajaxStart($("#loading").show()); causes a  j.handler.apply is not a function error
[08:44:18] <orolo> thanks
[08:44:38] <Hashmed> threw*
[08:44:48] <ajpiano> Hashmed: neither of those should work, you're not passing a function, you're executing it
[08:45:15] <ajpiano> also $() isnt a shortcut to document, it's $.ajaxStart(fn)
[08:45:25] <ajpiano> Hashmed, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[08:45:52] <ajpiano> fealls`work: i think we somewhat addressed it, see http://jqbug.com/7341
[08:46:43] * ryanneufeld waves @ ajpiano
[08:46:49] <ajpiano> heya ryanneufeld
[08:46:51] <Hashmed> I know, when an ajax request starts I want it to show the element with an ID of loading it the first statement worked perfectly fine qith 1.5
[08:46:55] <fealls`work> ajpiano: I did test it with 1.6.2 as well, and it didn't improve much (if at all)
[08:47:05] <jay252> ajpiano: You're absolutely right I can itterate over the elements attributes property. Thanks so much!
[08:47:17] <ajpiano> np jay252
[08:47:31] <ajpiano> fealls`work: i don't have ie here to test with right now
[08:47:34] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you're up early, unless you're on the east coast
[08:47:37] <ajpiano> but i recall it being improved
[08:47:42] <ajpiano> lol yeah i am
[08:47:45] <ajpiano> on the east coast
[08:47:56] <ryanneufeld> I'm not stalking I swear
[08:47:57] <ryanneufeld> lol
[08:48:06] <ajpiano> lol
[08:48:19] <fealls`work> ajpiano: I did set up a test case with 1.6.2 as well in it, I'll do it again and give you a link after running it on IE8 & chrome13 again, sec
[08:48:44] <ajpiano> fealls`work, you should definitely continue this discussion on the ticket, once you get the jsperfs
[08:48:58] <fealls`work> ajpiano: alrighty. thanks!
[08:49:20] <fealls`work> I found out about this in the worst moment ever
[08:49:25] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: do you know if that spinner bug I found was ever addressed?
[08:49:35] <ajpiano> i don't
[08:49:48] <Hashmed> ajpiano: how come this works with 1.5 but not 1.6.1 $('#someID').ajaxStart($("#loading").show());
[08:50:01] <ajpiano> don't know, but you're doing it wrong anyway
[08:50:06] <ajpiano> so garbage in garbage out i say
[08:50:34] <Hashmed> I don't get how it's wrong, can you provide a meaningful hint?
[08:50:44] <ryanneufeld> shouldn't that be $('#someID').ajaxStart(function(){$("#loading").show()});
[08:50:50] <ajpiano> read up to when i explained and sent you a link, Hashmed
[08:51:00] <ajpiano> about how you're not passing a function reference, but rather executing one
[08:51:08] <fealls`work> it's for some time now that we don't QA on IE, as we didn't do major changes to our UI except adding a few fields here and there, and today the product manager pitched our product to investors in guess what browser... (IE 8) (he got a few good yells from me), only to find it is really slow and pops up the "Script too slow error"
[08:51:12] <Hashmed> i want it to execute
[08:51:21] <ajpiano> no
[08:51:26] <ajpiano> you want it to execute WHEN that thing happens
[08:51:28] <ajpiano> not at the time you bind it
[08:51:31] <ajpiano> which is what you're doing it
[08:51:33] <ajpiano> so.
[08:52:08] <tmTim> I need some input on something. Would you attempt to do this in jQuery? The header area at http://www.intrepidboats.com/ which is flash. The person i'm doing this for needs the image to bleed under the menu part and the above header when different items are picked but it also needs to work in ie6. I am afraid of png support there not being appropriate
[08:52:18] <tmTim> I am not skilled in flash and really don't want to use it
[08:52:58] <ryanneufeld> tmTim: find a new client if they insist on IE6
[08:53:12] <tmTim> yes indeed I do agree there :)
[08:53:32] <tmTim> I think I will come up with a compromise if this seems doable in jQuery while also being fast loading as this flash one is
[08:53:40] <ryanneufeld> ?html5 boilerplate @ tmTim
[08:53:42] <Hashmed> so the implementation of callbacks is different, FYI it still doesn't work that way in 1.6.1 and doesn't perform the way I need it to in 1.5 if I do it "your" way
[08:53:57] <tmTim> I will have to learn how to show a loading bar between images and load them as they are picked or something
[08:54:00] <Hashmed> thanks anways
[08:54:04] <ryanneufeld> Hashmed: It's not "his" way
[08:54:07] <ryanneufeld> you're doing it wrong
[08:54:19] <tmTim> ?html5 boilerplate
[08:54:25] <phlp> being so worried about ie6 is pointless when using flash for a major part of the site. flash leaves people out the same way not supporting ie6 would
[08:54:43] <fealls`work> Everyone ditched ie6 long ago
[08:54:50] <tmTim> I have the analytics for the last few years and they have like 2% using it
[08:54:54] <fealls`work> and even google ditched ie7 for most of their stuff lately
[08:55:22] <phlp> i havnt had flash installed in a long time
[08:55:23] <Jon47> unless your audience is primarily in China, I'd highly recommend WONTFIXing that bug
[08:55:27] <ryanneufeld> tmTim: so do we, and we get 48Million hits/month
[08:55:31] <ryanneufeld> but we don't support it
[08:55:50] <tmTim> ryanneufeld: good point, I will just have to stand my ground and explain why it is just bad to support it now
[08:55:50] <ryanneufeld> MS has let it die
[08:56:01] <ryanneufeld> tmTim:MS has announced it's end of life
[08:56:16] <tmTim> ryanneufeld: that will be a good point to bring up for sure
[08:56:29] <tmTim> or else they can't have all of these fancy features
[08:56:42] <ryanneufeld> I would offer a conditional comment that would display a "Sorry we're not looking our best, but IE6 sucks donkey balls so we don't support it"
[08:56:46] <nbari> how to avoid google-Chrome to alter the order of a returned json array ?
[08:56:48] <ryanneufeld> or something to that effect
[08:56:51] <tmTim> hehe
[08:56:52] <fealls`work> tmTim: official MS site: http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[08:56:57] <ryanneufeld> nbari: it doesn't
[08:57:02] <systemfault> IE6 will still be supported until April 9th 2014
[08:57:11] <systemfault> That's its REAL EOL
[08:57:18] <systemfault> Was it 8th
[08:57:24] <systemfault> Anyway.. around that date :)
[08:57:56] <nbari> ryanneufeld: or how to avoid the sort
[08:57:57] <systemfault> It's 8th
[08:58:06] <ryanneufeld> nbari: it doesn't sort it either
[08:58:26] <nbari> well then how to make behavie like Firefox or Safari ?
[08:58:29] <ryanneufeld> nbari: it shouldn't I haven't seen it do that, and I use every day
[08:59:09] <JAAulde> Does anyone know if Filament group has a newer version of SelectToUISlider than this: http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_jquery_ui_slider_from_a_select_element_now_with_aria_support/
[08:59:48] <themadprofessor> evening
[08:59:49] <ryanneufeld> nbari: I haven't seen anything close to the behaviour you're describing
[08:59:56] <jay252> ajpiano: In regards to iterating over an elements event attributes, the elements attributes property only shows attributes that were defined when the element was created. If the onclick was assigned after the element was created do you know of any way to see this?
[09:00:01] <themadprofessor> can anyone help me out with a jquery ajax problem plese :) using this code : http://jsfiddle.net/v3yfE/
[09:00:11] <themadprofessor> the idea is that the data is retrieved and then retuned by the function
[09:00:13] <nbari> ryanneufeld: my select boxes are not order by name but google crhome seems to alter the order
[09:00:23] <ajpiano> jay252, what do you mean, jquery doesn't add "onclick" attributes
[09:00:34] <themadprofessor> but i get "results is undefined"  on line 3
[09:00:36] <ajpiano> so attempting to find events bound via js is not going to work
[09:00:44] <ajpiano> and if you're trying to actually dynamically add click events
[09:01:13] <ajpiano> then that's just a bad idea
[09:01:20] <systemfault> ajpiano: He means that jQuery uses addEventListener so iterating on the node's properties just won't work.
[09:01:24] <nbari> here is the json I receive via ajax: http://pastebin.com/NKEsuRT9
[09:01:33] <ryanneufeld> ?p @nbari
[09:01:40] <jay252> ajpiano: I have an element that was created outside of jquery, I want to inspect it to see if any event attributes are assigned to it.
[09:01:45] <nbari> and also there is how google chrome reorder the data
[09:01:47] <jay252> suck as onclick
[09:01:50] <jay252> such
[09:01:53] <nerk> anyone know how i would trap the enter key on inputs and do something else then submit the form?
[09:02:28] <Anitox> ?.keypress
[09:02:46] <Anitox> http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[09:02:53] <Anitox> check the key code for 13, which is the enter key
[09:03:00] <Anitox> then return false
[09:03:02] <fealls`work> ajpiano: my bad about the jsperf. using the latest version DOES indicate it's close to the levels of speed at 1.4.2
[09:03:45] <fealls`work> (i mistakely used 1.6.2 in the jquery script url, which made it use the previous script (1.6.1) and give me wrong data thinking it wasn't actually fixed.) thanks for the help anyways
[09:04:15] <ryanneufeld> gah, no bot t
[09:04:15] <fealls`work> though that being so slow compared to Chrome/Firefox actually requires me to do things different
[09:04:29] <nbari> the problem that I have is that the data is already been sorted on the server side via mysql but when processing the data the order is changed (just on Crhome) but wondering if there is a way with code to fix this or is a crhome issue
[09:05:03] <zw|w0rk> I have a quick question, i'm not entirely sure why, but inside of a jquery plugin (translation plugin..) i'm trying to manipulate an object's values that is established before the plugin is called, inside of the local scope, it appears the object changes.. but as soon as i'm out of the plugin block -- it's back to it's original state - as if the values weren't ever altered
[09:07:39] <ajpiano> fealls`work: at that point it's not really jquery's fault, just the fact that chrome and ff have much faster js engines
[09:09:12] <nbari> how can i make the code compatible ? currently users with safari/firefox can see the the select box or ul/li tables properly ordered but uwers with chrome can't
[09:09:24] <nbari> maybe changing the datatype:text instead of json could help ?
[09:10:48] <nerk> hrrm
[09:10:50] <Phoenixz> I'm a bit confused with setting texts in, for example, a <h1>.. Would I use $('h1.foobar').text('Hello world!'); ?
[09:10:57] <nerk> odd it works in a test case i just built in jsfiddle
[09:11:00] <Phoenixz> Because that doesnt seem to work
[09:11:05] <nerk> but not the environment I am trying to do this on
[09:11:13] <stefancrs> hey, me being a front-end noob. I'm rendering a calendar of sorts, with cells that are "bookable". I'd like to have the start timestamp for that cell accessible from js, should one add it as an attribute to the <a> tag I'm using for the cells?
[09:11:23] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/UhbYQ/1/
[09:12:52] <stefancrs> just <a data-timestamp="452662562"> ?
[09:13:19] <jinxdone> stefancrs, sure, why not
[09:13:27] <stefancrs> coolers
[09:15:25] <bakers> On the google search results you can use the arrow keys to navigate entries. How do they reposition the window to follow the arrow?
[09:16:13] <Phoenixz> I have an HTML <div> element clone()'d from another (hidden) one.. now, I alert(block.width()); and I get 0.. Should I not get a width?
[09:16:23] <Jon47> bakers can you say that another way, i'm not sure I follow
[09:16:44] <nickelnick> bakers: your talking about checking for a keyup or keydown
[09:16:48] <ajpiano> Phoenixz, the clone won't have a width until it's in the DOM
[09:17:18] <bakers> Jon47: If go here: http://www.google.com/search?q=smurf&btnG=Search and press up or down the arrow moves to each result. WHen you get to the bottom of the screen it repsotion the view window. How do I reposition the viewport
[09:17:33] <Jon47> yeah I see that now.. pretty cool, never used the cursor keys on that page before
[09:17:57] <Jon47> http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[09:18:20] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: ah, okay.. but as soon as I place it in the dom, it will imediately affect other elements, isnt it? Thing is, I want to move other elements out of the way smoothly with an animate, but for that, I'd need the width..
[09:18:36] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: I suppose I could use the width from the original..
[09:18:57] <nickelnick> bakers: check out my script for arrowing down to next and previous inputs
[09:19:01] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: you could use the width from the original, or position it offscreen to measure it's dimensions and then insert itinto its intended location
[09:19:08] <nickelnick> it uses tab to go to each also
[09:19:29] <nickelnick> http://pastie.org/2009315
[09:20:07] <nickelnick> bind the function to .keydown
[09:21:32] <Jon47> is there a way, given a node, to find it's order of appearance in the DOM relative to its parent?  say if I've got ul > li+li+li, and i have a handle on that third li, to get the number 2 (or 3 even.. depending on whether it's zero-indexed)
[09:21:47] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/index Jon47
[09:21:53] <Jon47> ah, sick, ty ajpiano
[09:31:05] <stefancrs> if I want to a post and move on to another page (by post I mean), do I need a form in the DOM or can one do it somehow anyway?
[09:31:22] <stefancrs> (it's not a problem to add a form with the right target, just wondering if it's unnecessary)
[09:32:31] <Jon47> stefancrs you don't necessary need a form.. you can just do $.post() and then update the location.href in the completion function..
[09:32:59] <stefancrs> Jon47: hm. and that will show the results of the post?
[09:33:21] <nguyendh> can i make my code shorter ? http://pastebin.com/xEYxbR3f
[09:33:32] <Jon47> stefancrs your success/error/complete function will have access to the response of the post to the server..
[09:33:40] <Jon47> but it sounds like you just want to do a classic post in html, not an ajax post
[09:33:44] <bakers> How can I find the coordinates of an element in relation to the viewport
[09:33:53] <stefancrs> Jon47: yep
[09:34:10] <Jon47> so forget jquery and just do it the old-fashioned way ;)
[09:34:18] <stefancrs> Jon47: well...
[09:34:26] <themadprofessor> hmmm
[09:34:53] <stefancrs> Jon47: i'm displaying a calendar with cells, and each cell is an <a> tag, and if you click one, you proceed to another page where you set up the event on the time you clicked
[09:35:00] <themadprofessor> if i want to make an ajax request, which will return a datestamp with the data, and if the datestamp is older than 10 minutes i want to remake the request... how do i recall the ajax query
[09:35:05] <stefancrs> Jon47: so there isn't any form per se
[09:35:19] <themadprofessor> i can't recall the query from within its own callback an i?
[09:35:24] <themadprofessor> *can
[09:35:31] <stefancrs> themadprofessor: why can't you?
[09:35:52] <stefancrs> themadprofessor: wrap it a method and call that method if needed. watch out for endless recursion.
[09:36:12] <Jon47> stefancrs ok, so do it with jquery, $.post and then examine the response from the server in your sucess function and conditionally update the location.href
[09:36:16] <themadprofessor> is a method and function the same thing?
[09:36:25] <stefancrs> Jon47: will have a go at that :)
[09:36:49] <Jon47> themadprofessor - typically calling something a method suggests that it's a member of a class/object
[09:36:57] <Jon47> but yeah, basically they are interchangable
[09:50:13] <depex> using a plugin to hide overflowing items from a div but I cant seem to make it work properly with dynamic resizing
[09:50:14] <depex> var Height = jQuery('.loop-1').height(); jQuery('.widget_fitnessbloggen_featured .widget-inside').height(Height -35).removeOverflow();
[09:50:34] <depex> bugs about 75% of the time, anything I can do to fix this?
[09:51:11] <ccmonster> i cannot get the jquery menu to work correctly at all
[09:51:18] <depex> check if my .loop-1 is done resizing or something?
[09:51:21] <ccmonster> submenus show in my fiddle, but in a page, no dice on submenus
[09:53:11] <danyk2099> How come Fancybox doesn't work on data craeted by ajax?!?
[09:53:30] <stefancrs> Jon47: hm, so.. what do I do in the success callback actually? :)
[09:53:57] <Jon47> stefancrs - i can't do it for ya
[09:54:04] <stefancrs> I get that
[09:54:30] <stefancrs> but I can't redirect... should I just set the location, without going there, and replace the DOM?
[09:54:40] <Jon47> oh god no!
[09:54:44] <Jon47> why can't you redirect?
[09:54:52] <stefancrs> won't that result in a GET?
[09:54:59] <Jon47> yes
[09:55:10] <Jon47> but it happens (conditionally) after your post..
[09:55:22] <stefancrs> so I have to rewrite the backend to deal with this? :)
[09:55:35] <stefancrs> so that it stores the post stuff and displays it on get?
[09:56:14] <Jon47> or add the form element somewhere and just submit it synchronously
[09:56:31] <stefancrs> seems easier
[09:58:35] <nickelnick> hey adam, is the crossDomain specification in ajax broken?
[09:58:56] <d4rklit3> has anyone encountered an issue where fancybox just opens up at the size of the page?
[10:05:02] <stefancrs> Jon47: works a treat, thanks
[10:05:41] <Jon47> np bro
[10:08:27] <Flammy> I'm trying to use  .toggle () but with nested toggles and several on one page. the sample code I have just has it toggling a paragraph tag, how do I ensure it toggles the right one?
[10:09:27] <jonclark> show us the code, Flammy :)
[10:10:04] <le_coeur> hm,  var run = function() {  run â€¦  } how can I do this without to define var, something like this function() {this;}  ?
[10:11:10] <Flammy> jonclark: k, one sec
[10:13:39] <le_coeur> oops, I found a solution
[10:14:16] <Flammy> jonclark: http://jsfiddle.net/7mLHZ/
[10:14:37] <Flammy> I'd like the 'north view' button to open the image, and the kitchen button to only open the north view button
[10:14:43] <Flammy> but I don
[10:14:57] <Flammy> but i don't know how to tie each button to a specific paragraph tag
[10:17:18] <JAAulde> wtf, when did JSFiddle remove the option to include UI w/ jQ?
[10:17:49] <Flammy> jonclark: any advice?
[10:18:16] <jonclark> yea one sec
[10:18:52] <Flammy> k, thanks
[10:20:56] <themadprofessor> if i want to repeatedly call a function, waiting 3 seconds between each time
[10:21:05] <themadprofessor> can i use functionName().delay(3000); ?
[10:21:24] <themadprofessor> within a while loop?
[10:21:35] <fero> setTimeout(function() {}, 3000);
[10:23:29] <JAAulde> Can anyone explain jQuery's UI slider to me?  I cannot seem to make it work--at all... http://jsfiddle.net/YNAb2/1/
[10:24:16] <themadprofessor> have you included the jquery ui library
[10:25:37] <themadprofessor> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.13/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[10:26:55] <ccmonster> how do i get the jquery menu to work with something that isnt <LI><a>
[10:27:02] <ccmonster> and is li's with say options and radios?
[10:27:05] <JAAulde> update: CSS included in fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YNAb2/2/
[10:27:33] <JAAulde> themadprofessor: yes, in the fiddle open "Manage Resources" on the left and you'll see that I have UI included
[10:29:52] <nickelnick> ccmonster: which jquery menu?
[10:29:59] <nickelnick> treemenu?
[10:30:36] <ccmonster> regular jquery.menu()
[10:30:49] <ccmonster> im trying to get the flyouts to work and it does in a fiddle, but on my page, even with css and such stripped out, it does not
[10:31:21] <nickelnick> using same version both sides?
[10:31:34] <fero> I am making script for loading some content via ajax. There is google ads on the page and somethimes i got redirected to that google ad. Does anyone have a clue about this problem?
[10:31:36] <JAAulde> has anyone else here ever gotten jQ UI slider to work?
[10:32:06] <nickelnick> jaaulde, ya dude but never really use it
[10:32:27] <nickelnick> it works on the demo too....
[10:32:41] <JAAulde> as far as I can see there is no way I could be doing something wrong...it won't work in Fiddle or my site
[10:32:52] <ccmonster> yea, same all around
[10:33:09] <nickelnick> oh i thought u were saying it worked in fiddle but not your site
[10:33:20] <nickelnick> oops wrng person ahha
[10:33:33] <nickelnick> does it even show up?
[10:33:37] <nickelnick> the slide
[10:33:43] <JAAulde> no
[10:33:55] <nickelnick> ah, you got something wrong in your html then
[10:34:04] <JAAulde> my selecets get the slider classes, and the UI CSS causes some styling on the selects, but no slider
[10:34:33] <cgcardona> can anyone recommend a good copy to clipboard plugin or code example?
[10:34:38] <ccmonster> um.
[10:34:38] <nickelnick> do u have a live link?
[10:34:44] <ccmonster> i doubt it at this point
[10:34:49] <nickelnick> pastie.org
[10:34:50] <ccmonster> ive checked hi and low.
[10:35:12] <JAAulde> nickelnick: http://jsfiddle.net/YNAb2/2/
[10:35:14] <nickelnick> sorry ccmonster...was taling to jaauld
[10:35:22] <nickelnick> about the slider deal
[10:35:38] <fero> JAAUlde you need to make div not select element
[10:35:42] <nickelnick> cc: your saying it works in fiddle but not your site right?
[10:35:52] <fero> and then in javascript put range
[10:35:56] <JAAulde> dero expound please?
[10:35:57] <fero> or something like that
[10:36:11] <JAAulde> nickelnick: no, it does not work anywhere
[10:36:25] <nickelnick> ah yea thats funky biz jjaulde
[10:36:29] <fero> <div id="one"> </div> <div id="two"> </div> <div id="three"> </div>
[10:36:33] <fero> html
[10:36:38] <JAAulde> fero: wtf, no effing way
[10:37:10] <JAAulde> I mean, I am not saying you're wrong, but if you're right, that's jacked
[10:37:22] <fero> try it :)
[10:37:33] <fero> and you then put max and min
[10:37:49] <ccmonster> Yes nickelnick . http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/13/

[10:38:08] <nickelnick> jaaulde: ya man hes right
[10:38:09] <ccmonster> thats the exact ul structure out of my site, as well as the only css and js on that page right now
[10:38:30] <nickelnick> far as i remember that is
[10:38:31] <fero> I am making script for loading some content via ajax. There is google ads on the page and somethimes i got redirected to that google ad. Does anyone have a clue about this problem?
[10:38:32] <JAAulde> well that's pure shit
[10:38:40] <JAAulde> how the eff is that semantic?
[10:38:49] <systemfault> Hmm.. A better jQuery API reference than the real website, http://jqapi.com/
[10:38:57] <phlp> ccmonster: did you put it in $(document).ready() fiddle does that for you
[10:39:01] <nickelnick> why not just use jquery to set the slider
[10:39:10] <nickelnick> instead of divs
[10:39:16] <levifig> hey guys, any idea why the .ajax call is not doing a redirect in success (even though I'm getting the data from it successfully in the database): success: function() { window.location.href = "http://domain.com/redirected"; } ?
[10:39:24] <JAAulde> nickelnick: the site I am currently developing uses a very old filament group plugin to turn selects into sliders
[10:39:28] <levifig> it just doesn't redirect
[10:39:43] <JAAulde> I was hoping to move to this UI function as it is more current
[10:39:47] <ccmonster> yeap. hold on. i will show a pasty in a second.
[10:39:48] <nickelnick> ohhh dang
[10:39:57] <nickelnick> sounds to me like a revision of html
[10:40:02] <nickelnick> that sux
[10:40:14] <JAAulde> makes 0 sense to put a div in the markup and turn it into a slider
[10:40:28] <JAAulde> so much for progressive enhancement of a SELECT or other form element
[10:40:32] <nickelnick> what about span?
[10:40:32] <themadprofessor> hmmmm. i'm trying to get a number to increment every second until it reaches a target. but it seems that setTimeout within a while loop doesn't have the desired effect (it actually crashes my browser)... http://pastie.org/2009670
[10:40:38] <nickelnick> ohhh
[10:41:32] <fero> JAAulde : you can collect properties and replace with divs
[10:41:46] <levifig> basically nothing is going on on "success" even though I get the form submitted nicely
[10:41:47] <nickelnick> yah that sucks but
[10:41:50] <fero> that includes slider
[10:42:21] <JAAulde> this is the first thing I have ever dealt with in UI that makes me go "WTF?"
[10:42:23] <JAAulde> *sigh*
[10:42:51] <nickelnick> i fell into a similar situation with molding jquerymobile around a site
[10:43:07] <JAAulde> oh well, I see that you're right, fero, and am adapting this code monster on our site to the UI demo stuff
[10:43:09] <nickelnick> i was able to manage however
[10:43:14] <ccmonster> what did you say?
[10:43:26] <fero> you don need to change markup
[10:43:46] <fero> you can make javascript read values of select element
[10:43:55] <fero> and then make slider based on that
[10:44:27] <JAAulde> fero: I understand and that is what I wil do
[10:44:31] <JAAulde> but it makes zero sense to me
[10:44:57] <JAAulde> esp since Filament Group has had a progressive enhacement chunk of code to do JUST THIS THING for years
[10:45:16] <JAAulde> anywho, sorry muy frustration has carried into the chan
[10:45:24] <JAAulde> thanks for the help fero and nickelnick
[10:45:37] <fero> np
[10:46:03] <fero> if you want i can make fiddle with that functionality ?
[10:46:16] <JAAulde> fero: na, I know how
[10:46:23] <JAAulde> I just had no idea I'd need to
[10:46:32] * nickelnick needs to get back on task...bbl
[10:47:03] <fero> Anyone have the answer for my problem - I am making script for loading some content via ajax. There is google ads on the page and somethimes i got redirected to that google ad. Does anyone have a clue about this problem?
[10:47:12] <phlp> JAAulde: why not use the one by filament group?
[10:48:27] <b0ot> I have a bash script monitoring stuff on my system. The output of my bash script is a number that I want to use to update my progress bar up and down from: http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/#animated I would like the bar to be able to dynamically move without the user updating the page... is there a way to do this?
[10:49:04] <phlp> JAAulde: their page says "These progressive enhancement features will eventually be rolled into the jQuery UI slider itself."
[10:49:05] <ccmonster> wtf does missing } in XML expression mean in firebug?
[10:49:14] <ccmonster> there is no } needed on the line its referencing
[10:49:27] <evll> hello. a question about jquery-ui here.
[10:49:27] <evll> is there a way to make a draggable image to be inserted into text under the cursor?
[10:49:27] <evll> so far I can only get absolute positioning above text
[10:49:37] <JAAulde> phlp: 1) which one by filament group?
[10:49:48] <phlp> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_jquery_ui_slider_from_a_select_element_now_with_aria_support
[10:49:56] <JAAulde> phlp: that's what we're using now
[10:49:59] <orolo> in my function, $(this) returns an object but i just want the html DOM name for it.
[10:50:06] <JAAulde> it seems to have issues in jQ 1.6+
[10:50:24] <orolo> <div class="thisone"></div> instead of Object.

[10:59:41] <MIRV-> err
[10:59:54] <MIRV-> $('input ~ label')
[11:00:06] <imanc> $('#myinputfield').prev('label') perhaps?
[11:00:35] <MIRV-> if they are direct siblings the sibling CSS3 operator will work just fine..
[11:00:50] <imanc> MIRV-: yes they're next to each other
[11:01:28] <fero> I am making script for loading some content via ajax. There is google ads on the page and somethimes i got redirected to that google ad . Does anyone have a clue about this problem?  $.('<div>').append(response); on this line i got redirection

[11:15:03] <orolo> i mean what you did works perfect.
[11:15:14] <orolo> but does it solve my issue. thank you.
[11:16:00] <orolo> ccmonster: your menu is not working locally but working in fiddle, is that right?
[11:16:35] <ccmonster> yea.
[11:16:56] <orolo> ccmonster: anything show up in firebug (or inspector) console?
[11:17:00] <ccmonster> is the jquery-ui-menu include in the full jquery-ui.js or do i need to pull it in specially
[11:17:38] <orolo> ccmonster: i don't know that it's actually included yet; isn't it still in beta?
[11:17:52] <orolo> where are you pulling jqueryui from? google?
[11:18:30] <ccmonster> ok, looks like you gotta pull it in seperately at the moment.
[11:18:33] <ccmonster> i just got it to work.
[11:18:37] <ccmonster> ugg, that's a total pain in the ass

[11:37:00] <phlp>  $('').change(myOwnFunction);
[11:37:23] <imanc> phlp: cheers - will an instance of $() be passed as $(this) to the function?
[11:37:56] <phlp> this will be the same as if you passed an anonymous function
[11:41:31] <swiggy> is this a valid selector
[11:41:40] <swiggy> $('*[id*="something"]')
[11:41:55] <systemfault> Yes
[11:41:55] <phlp> yes
[11:42:39] <systemfault> Selects elements of any type having an id attribute that contains "something"
[11:42:56] <systemfault> The first * is not needed actually.
[11:42:59] <swiggy> right on

[12:05:15] <Anitox> confirm("Are you sure?");
[12:05:44] <Anitox> returns true or false depending on if they choose Yes or No, respectively
[12:06:10] <Anitox> both confirm() and alert() are javascript functions, not jQuery stuff
[12:06:54] <cuQa> oh okay, but jquery makes the popup I guess?
[12:06:54] <necromancer> cuQa: alert() is also a straight JS function
[12:07:01] <Anitox> no
[12:07:18] <necromancer> cuQa: your browser makes it
[12:07:51] <necromancer> cuQa: http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html read it, then you'll understand jQuery better.
[12:07:59] <nickelnick> in jquery mobile....how come when i hit enter, its like hitting submit if there exists no button to submit
[12:08:08] <nickelnick> when i am within a text nput
[12:08:19] <Anitox> nickelnick, you need to do a check for key code 13 and return false
[12:08:25] <Anitox> ?.keypress
[12:08:37] * Anitox kicks the bot.
[12:08:38] <nickelnick> ah darn...thought might be easier way
[12:08:52] <Anitox> you can do a global return false on it
[12:09:04] <Anitox> $(window).keypress(function(){
[12:09:06] <Anitox> then check for it there
[12:09:16] <Anitox> but, set an argument for that function
[12:09:43] <Anitox> example on: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[12:12:02] <nickelnick> k thx
[12:13:06] <muszek> hi... newbie question: when you need to store item's database id number in the html (example: <a href="#" someattrib="52">delete comment #52</a>, which attribute do you use for it?  Say attribute "id" cannot be used (for example because there's more than one element).
[12:13:13] <Aut0ExeC> weirdest thing... i loaded the jquery lib but it wont do anything
[12:13:47] <muszek> Aut0ExeC: I don't think it does anything by itself.
[12:14:22] <Aut0ExeC> muszek: http://pastebin.com/A2JNsBWr
[12:14:46] <Aut0ExeC> muszek: thats all between the <head>
[12:14:51] <Aut0ExeC> but no cigar
[12:15:07] <Aut0ExeC> can you see where i went wrong?
[12:15:22] <phlp> muszek: http://api.jquery.com/data
[12:16:05] <muszek> phlp: thank you
[12:16:47] <Aut0ExeC> can someone please help with http://pastebin.com/A2JNsBWr
[12:16:52] <Aut0ExeC> cant see where i'm going wrong
[12:17:18] <phlp> do you have an element on the page with class="heading"
[12:18:10] <Aut0ExeC> phlp: yes
[12:18:54] <phlp> did you click it?
[12:19:04] <Aut0ExeC> yessir
[12:19:07] <Aut0ExeC> and nothing
[12:19:07] <phlp> :)
[12:19:12] <Aut0ExeC> i'm using 960 grid
[12:19:20] <Aut0ExeC> perhaps i'll set it up as a seperate id
[12:19:24] <Aut0ExeC> cuz i have multiple classes together
[12:19:29] <Aut0ExeC> lemme try that
[12:20:10] <muszek> Aut0ExeC: it works over here
[12:20:17] <Aut0ExeC> oh it works?
[12:20:18] <Aut0ExeC> damn
[12:20:57] <Aut0ExeC> weird man
[12:21:00] <Aut0ExeC> still no cigar
[12:21:06] <phlp> paste the html
[12:21:14] <muszek> Aut0ExeC: http://bobek.muszek.com:37080/temp/test.html
[12:24:23] <mikedoty> I have <div><span1 class='x'/><span2 class='x'/><span3 class='x'/><ul></ul></div>.  I'm trying $(div).find("span.x:last-child") but it's returning null.  If I just do .find("span.x") then it does give me the spans.
[12:24:43] <mikedoty> If I do .find("span.x").filter(":last") it works how I want.  I'm confused as to why the first approach failed, though.
[12:25:03] <mikedoty> Was I doing something syntactically incorrect when I tried .find("span.x:last-child") ?
[12:25:21] <innociv_> Wow.  Some domain I want is just one of 1,400,000 squatted on the same server it looks like.
[12:26:40] <jonclark> mikedoty, if you did $("div span.x:last-child") you would get the expected result
[12:26:53] <Aut0ExeC> muszek: was my link to the jquery
[12:26:58] <Aut0ExeC> muszek: weird...ur link works
[12:27:01] <Aut0ExeC> muszek: mine doesnt
[12:27:05] <jonclark> looks like :last-child assumes a parent selector. http://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/
[12:27:39] <mikedoty> Ok.  My real code had a couple additional layers in it, so maybe it wa sthat, or maybe I screwed up the DOM itself or something
[12:27:44] <mikedoty> Thanks for the help
[12:27:45] <Anitox> $("div span.x:last")
[12:29:08] <geestring> if($("#morning").is(':visible')){ $("#morning").hide(); $("#afternoon").show(); } else { $("#morning").show(); $("#afternoon").hide();}       this if statement seems to just run through both conditions and i cant figure out why
[12:29:47] <jonclark> geestring, toggle() ?
[12:29:47] <jeffsmykil> Counting mouse clicks on an element?  I know I have seen something in the documentation before, but now I can;t find it
[12:31:07] <Anitox> $("#morning, #afternoon").toggle();
[12:36:33] <muszek> phlp: data() is nice, but I need to set that data with php, not jquery
[12:38:22] <phlp> muszek: http://jsfiddle.net/tfSHR
[12:38:25] <muszek> phlp: I used to insert a special class, for example: class="special52" and to get it I'd loop through all classes and see if it begins with "special"... but it doesn't sound like an optimal solution
[12:39:00] <muszek> phlp: hmmm... does it validate?
[12:40:45] <phlp> muszek: it's valid html5, dont know if it validates for anything else but it definitely works
[12:41:23] <muszek> phlp: ok, thanks for your help :)
[12:49:26] <geestring> jonclark, I want to eventually use animate on that code.
[12:49:30] <vector_xyz> what do you call one that is good in web dev, design, programming, js, c++ etc... can't call him a Software Engineer or Applications Developer... what kind of title would such person have ?

[12:56:16] <Patman> has anyone delt with adding .click function to multiple elements and trying to make it run once?
[12:57:59] <erichynds> ?one @ Patman
[12:58:00] <bot-t> Patman, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[12:59:06] <Patman> will it also do it .live?
[13:00:46] <erichynds> no
[13:00:51] <Patman> hmm its still running it multiple times wiht .one
[13:01:14] <Patman> i have several links with the same class and then this $('a.lsContentPopbox').one('click', function(e)
[13:02:49] <coreyw> $('a').click(function() {$('a').unbind('click'); // all your code});
[13:06:40] <Patman> @coreyw worked, thanks

[13:12:10] <Innocentus> hiii
[13:12:51] <phlp> welcome Maximus Innocentus
[13:14:30] <necromancer> hey i'm having an issue with jsonp...i get the "invalid label" error, even though i ran it through jsonlint.com and confirmed it's valid. here is the ajax call: https://gist.github.com/1005208 and here's the JSON being returned: https://gist.github.com/1005203
[13:18:39] <swimrr> hey all
[13:19:45] <swimrr> can anyone recommend a simple rotating image script for the top of a web page?
[13:20:43] <versatiletech> swimrr: it would be extremely simple just to write one from scratch
[13:20:55] <themadprofessor> it's not really jquery but does anyone fancy helping me out with some maths :)
[13:21:29] <systemfault> necromancer: I'm not really jsonp knowledgeable but.. it looks weird to me, it looks like a normal XHR transaction, not JSONP
[13:21:44] <swimrr> versatiletech: uh....not fer a noob like me
[13:21:51] <systemfault> necromancer: You use post, no callback.. nothing.
[13:21:52] <swimrr> :-)
[13:22:41] <Innocentus> hii
[13:22:58] <Innocentus> Can you recommend me a good timepicker-jquery ui plugin?
[13:23:13] <Innocentus> I found a nice one for dates - the datepicker jquery ui plugin.
[13:23:23] <Innocentus> But for time, what can you recommend to me for?
[13:23:54] <nguyendh> i use datepicker jquery ui
[13:24:03] <versatiletech> have an array with URIs to your images, then generate a random number between the between 0 and the size of the array minus 1. Then grab the random number and use it to find that element in the array and echo it to the html src attribute of image
[13:24:08] <nguyendh> u can try jquery tools , it has date plugin
[13:24:23] <saimon69> necromancer: look mjustlike JSON to me, where is the surrounding function?
[13:25:15] <saimon69> like functionName({data1:'data',data2:'data'});
[13:26:35] <necromancer> systemfault: ah turns out it was an improper callback
[13:26:49] <systemfault> Thought so.
[13:26:57] <necromancer> systemfault: i had to encapsulate the json in the GET callback param and parenthesis
[13:27:15] <necromancer> i was trying to get it working with regular XHR/JSON
[13:27:15] <systemfault> necromancer: JSONP is just a stupid name someone invented for "I create a <script> tag and set the src to get around the SOP"
[13:27:19] <systemfault> Right.
[13:27:32] <necromancer> it is on the same domain
[13:27:40] <necromancer> but honestly, i'm just gonna use jsonp all the time now
[13:27:40] <systemfault> Then why do you use JSONP?
[13:27:48] <necromancer> it wasn't working with just straight json
[13:27:50] <systemfault> It's shit jsonp.
[13:27:57] <systemfault> It's a hack, no more, no less.
[13:28:00] <necromancer> yeah i know
[13:28:10] <necromancer> but it seems to work most of the time
[13:28:19] <necromancer> regular json doesn't seem to work properly all the time
[13:28:35] <systemfault> Should work all the time as long as the URL is on the same domain.
[13:29:51] <systemfault> Of course, there's also the possible security issues..
[13:29:59] <systemfault> You're choice mate :/
[13:31:37] <necromancer> systemfault: when i change it back to regular json, i get errors...invalid label and jQuery152021447514378771448_1307046638650 was not called
[13:31:50] <rgr> that jqfundamentals hasnt even got a working index.htm.
[13:32:29] <tman> has anyone run into issues when trying to set the opacity on a png in ie?  my filter is being ignored.
[13:32:47] <necromancer> surrounding the returned JSON in () seems to fix the invalid label thing
[13:32:52] <necromancer> but i'm still getting the callback not found error
[13:33:19] <systemfault> necromancer: Normal XHR doesn't work with a callback like JSONP
[13:34:12] <saimon69> since JSONP is the same like invoking the function functionName with an object as parameter, you just need to have the equivalent function
[13:36:03] <saimon69> might suggest to change the AJAX here as: success: function (feed){  functionName(feed)   }    and make a functionName outside that receives it
[13:37:12] <thelastbaldwin> Can anyone help me use jquery.color.js to make a smooth transition to a hover state with a different background color?
[13:37:13] <saimon69> hmm maybe not
[13:39:02] <saimon69> how can i insert a script in a div?
[13:39:18] <saimon69> using jquery
[13:39:31] <systemfault> Not sure I get it.
[13:39:39] <chrislabeard> Hey, I need a good way of showing the default value in a textfield and them removing it but on form submit to clear all the default values so the form can validate correctly. Any idea on a good method?
[13:39:55] <necromancer> saimon69: like an external file?
[13:39:58] <necromancer> or inline JS?
[13:40:35] <Tant102> chrislabeard; http://diveintohtml5.org/examples/input-placeholder.html
[13:40:38] <Tant102> html 5 goodies? ;)
[13:40:40] <evantravers> question... I'm trying to protect a form from spam by adding the email field after page load. Has anyone ever done this and is there a trick to it?
[13:40:44] <saimon69> nope, like a string: have a flashObject that generates a flash chart and on a button press need to recreate the chart and the script that generates it
[13:40:58] <chrislabeard> Tant102: Yeah I don't think i can use html5 though cause it needs to work for IE7
[13:41:07] <chrislabeard> that would be so nice If I could use that
[13:41:08] <Tant102> evantravers, what type of spam are you trying to protect yourself from?
[13:41:23] <saimon69> necromancer: as inline JS, yes
[13:41:26] <evantravers> just bot spam
[13:41:50] <Tant102> chrislabeard; http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/309915069/swapping-input-field-placeholder-text-with-jquery
[13:42:02] <Tant102> Combine that with something that clears the field when the form submits.

[13:42:29] <jonclark> the top voted answer is what i've been using

[13:42:42] <orolo> hmm. what's the documentation for forms and options?
[13:42:47] <necromancer> i have to use jsonp for that?
[13:42:55] <ccmonster> in an text input, if i hit enter, im handling it correctly and triggering my search button without posting the page. However, if i hit enter again, it posts and the default is not prevented

[13:43:21] <danstever> hey everyone - I need some help. I have a page that refreshes div content via ajax. it loads a img slideshow that needs to be called, but it will not fire. I assume it is because the content is loaded after the (document).ready has fired too. Tried putting another (document).ready in the external file div, but still won't work. Any suggestions?
[13:43:42] <evantravers> thanks jonclark
[13:43:46] <ccmonster> jsfiddle or pastie danstever
[13:44:19] <systemfault> necromancer: What type of transaction is it? POST ?
[13:44:20] <hlveheart> i'll jsfiddle you!
[13:44:27] * hlveheart giggles like a school girl
[13:44:36] <vector_xyz> jsbin is better fiddle is for newbs!
[13:44:43] <systemfault> necromancer: And by data, do you mean the data config property?
[13:44:44] <hlveheart> pastebin is for the winners
[13:44:46] <hlveheart> :|
[13:45:16] <necromancer> systemfault: POST, yeah. and by data i mean the first parameter in success: function(), where it returns the response
[13:45:28] <vector_xyz> am i the only one still using jquery 1.2.1
[13:45:32] <systemfault> necromancer: You're using .ajax?
[13:45:35] <necromancer> yep
[13:45:38] <vector_xyz> what happened to being cool and old skool
[13:45:47] <systemfault> necromancer: Then you probably got a string back
[13:45:56] <necromancer> okay
[13:46:14] <hlveheart> I want to jsfiddle all of you, cutie patooties.
[13:46:29] <necromancer> systemfault: the response should be JSON...
[13:46:31] <hlveheart> dont judge.
[13:46:33] <systemfault> necromancer: You need to either 1) parse it with jQuery.parseJSON OR 2(Use jQuery.getJSON instead of .ajax
[13:46:49] <systemfault> necromancer: JSON is a string.
[13:46:57] <systemfault> necromancer: You need to parse it to an object.
[13:47:05] <necromancer> oh ok
[13:47:20] <systemfault> necromancer: Both ways will work.
[13:47:35] <systemfault> necromancer: 2) is just a wrapper on .ajax
[13:47:54] <systemfault> That will give you an object like you want.
[13:47:58] <danstever> ccmonster: http://pastie.org/2010524
[13:47:59] <necromancer> ok
[13:49:52] <ccmonster> have you done some console logging to debug where it's failing
[13:50:01] <ccmonster> and you dont need 'normal' in the fadeIn/Outs
[13:50:19] <ccmonster> it defaults with nothing there to 800ms, it's probably better to use the milliseconds anyway
[13:50:20] <necromancer> systemfault: thanks, .getJSON worked
[13:50:25] <danstever> ccmonster: it just doesn't fire...
[13:50:41] <systemfault> necromancer: :D
[13:50:51] <ccmonster> throw a console.log('step 1') etc
[13:50:55] <ccmonster> and figure out where it fails
[13:51:01] <systemfault> necromancer: So much people don't understand JSON...
[13:51:05] <danstever> ccmonster: If I open developer tools and type in the console the (function($) {$('#team-photo').cycle('fade');})(jQuery); it fires straight away
[13:51:08] <ccmonster> and log out the response of load
[13:51:13] <necromancer> systemfault: well it is quite confusing :)
[13:51:14] <systemfault> necromancer: It's just a serialization format, it's a damn string.
[13:51:25] <ccmonster> ok. then you are initializing it wrong
[13:51:40] <necromancer> right but it's also a file type, like xml
[13:51:47] <necromancer> at least, it can be..
[13:52:29] <danstever> ccmonster: ... soo... i'm just lost because that is the exact thing I have in my file too.
[13:54:12] <ccmonster> which line is not firing again?
[13:55:12] <danstever> ccmonster: in my pastie link - http://pastie.org/2010524 - Lines 63 - 73
[13:55:35] <danstever> ccmonster: lines 60 - 91 are the ones loaded via ajax
[13:55:48] <ccmonster> rip out the stuf wrapped around document.ready
[13:55:50] <ccmonster> you dont need that
[13:56:50] <danstever> ccmonster: i do. I'm using this inside Drupal
[13:57:04] <ccmonster> ah.
[13:57:44] <ccmonster> im not sure what drupal could be doing to cause problem.s
[13:59:23] <danstever> ccmonster: ... tell me about it.
[14:00:05] <danstever> ccmonster: thanks for taking a moment to look though. I have to run.

[14:07:14] <ceej> I thought you could just parse html into $()

[14:29:36] <Jayflux> jaequery you probably want to look at .animate()

[14:30:19] <jaequery> i probably already did :)
[14:30:24] <gkatsev> Jayflux: I should probably take a look at that too. Have some stuff I want to do that it would be useful for.
[14:30:40] <jaequery> just don't know if there's a way to do it indefinitely going back and forth without me resorting to setTimeout
[14:33:54] <systemfault> CSS3 animations I guess :/ If your browser supports them :P
[14:36:52] <gkatsev> systemfault: ff5 finally supports them!

[14:56:14] <jesta> ^-- this is what jsfiddle, gists and pastebin are for
[14:56:26] <jesta> too bad I was late on my arrow
[14:56:29] <xcaliber> i need to get the respected grade_details to show
[14:56:41] <weavie> here's what I have
[14:56:44] <weavie> http://pastebin.com/HeisBjhC
[14:57:38] <xcaliber> man, it's tough to get questions answered here huh?  anybody wanna volunteer to help me 1 on 1?
[14:57:57] <weavie> this is a drupal webform where #webform-component-donation is my fieldset of pulldowns and I'm trying to get the total selected to populate the text field #edit-submitted-donation-checkbox-results
[14:58:50] <snover> weavie: do *not* paste in the channel
[14:59:15] <weavie> I had it working with a set of checkboxes but can't figure out how to make it work with dropdowns
[14:59:26] <weavie> (thanks, I got the hint about pasting)
[14:59:57] <KWhat_Work> can you bind events with names spaces like this?  .bind({ 'mousedown.filebox': function(e) {
[15:00:13] <Cork[home]> yes
[15:01:57] <snover> xcaliber: you havenâ€™t actually asked a question bro
[15:02:16] <keyo> snover: yeah, I had to use some string processing to fix it. but in jquery really
[15:03:14] <xcaliber> umm, so  you know how i have a bunch of loops with class grade_details, i want the correct ones to show when I expand the table
[15:04:02] <xcaliber> meaning every grade_details in the for loop as one
[15:04:12] <xcaliber> and when the for loop runs again, then all the ones in taht one as another group
[15:08:59] <xcaliber> anybody?

[15:11:03] <Fidelix> Am I doing something wrong, or is jQuery very buggy with IE8?
[15:11:49] <TheIronSky> Everything is buggy with IE8
[15:12:27] <Fidelix> TheIronSky, how do you generally work with that?
[15:12:44] <TheIronSky> I don't
[15:12:50] <dadsasfgds> http://www.snowlinux.de/ Snowlinux
[15:13:00] <phlp> $.bugs.fix();
[15:13:05] <TheIronSky> I just said "screw IE8" and decided I'd only support Firefox and Chrome
[15:13:13] <TheIronSky> not advised
[15:13:16] <TheIronSky> but it is an option
[15:13:28] <donssp> good evening
[15:13:42] <necromancer> Fidelix: it's quite easy to code for IE8 if you're competent and you know how everything works
[15:13:45] <Fidelix> TheIronSky, yes, it is. But throwing away 30% of my visitors is not an option
[15:13:56] <necromancer> Fidelix: in fact, i find IE 8'
[15:14:10] <Fidelix> necromancer, then I believe I'm not competent, and I don't know how anything works.
[15:14:19] <necromancer> to be way more strict when it comes to proper formatting of markup & CSS
[15:14:24] <Fidelix> But I'm trying very simple stuff with jquery and IE8, and it does not work.
[15:14:41] <necromancer> Fidelix: paste what you're trying to do
[15:14:43] <necromancer> jsfiddle.net
[15:15:37] <necromancer> Fidelix: a lot of IE "incompatibilities" stem from the programmer's misunderstanding of proper CSS or HTML formatting. everything else wrong with IE is just that: a bug.
[15:17:46] <necromancer> TheIronSky: you realize that your code only supports 33% of the market, right?
[15:18:02] <saimon69> hey necromancer, sorry was at lunch, any idea for me? they told me eval is evil so i dont use it, plus i need to receive values from another script in the page so not sure the external js might work, any other idea?
[15:18:59] <Fidelix> necromancer, http://jsfiddle.net/fzsQg/
[15:19:04] <necromancer> saimon69: why do you want to put all that JS in a string?
[15:19:25] <necromancer> saimon69: can't you just run all that JS as javascript within a doc ready?
[15:20:23] <saimon69> well, is a flash chart that i need to reload when the user change params
[15:20:56] <saimon69> i did it in the past using ajax, was trying not to use it again plus have several charts
[15:21:10] <necromancer> not sure why you wouldn't want to use ajax but..
[15:21:47] <necromancer> an elegant solution would be to put that JS/swfobject call in a function and just call the function every time
[15:22:26] <necromancer> saimon69: why can't you use ajax now?
[15:22:32] <TheIronSky> necromancer: I haven't worked on my site in a year, not really worried about it.
[15:22:57] <TheIronSky> necromancer: my audience is pretty specialized anyway
[15:23:01] <saimon69> hope will work
[15:23:05] <necromancer> TheIronSky: ah i was assuming this was a general thing
[15:23:16] <necromancer> saimon69: if you already got it working with ajax before, why wouldn't it work now?
[15:23:17] <TheIronSky> necromancer: the only people who use the site are co-workers who use Firefox 4
[15:23:30] <saimon69> because in the past had only one chart now might have 3 or 4
[15:24:07] <necromancer> saimon69: displaying simultaneously on the page?
[15:24:14] <saimon69> so need to generate the flash for each one with $('#'+namediv) and might not work am afraid
[15:24:19] <saimon69> yup
[15:24:25] <necromancer> i don't see why not
[15:24:45] <saimon69> is a stats page, and each chart has form controls that should change parameters
[15:24:49] <necromancer> more intense things have been done
[15:25:04] <saimon69> from others, am still kinda n00b and dont do OOP
[15:25:07] <saimon69> yet
[15:25:10] <necromancer> lol
[15:25:13] <necromancer> you can't anyway ;)
[15:25:18] <necromancer> well that's not true
[15:25:20] <necromancer> JS is kinda OOP
[15:25:41] <necromancer> but it doesn't use classical inheritance (which means you can't really make classes and expect them to behave the same way as in other languages)
[15:25:48] <necromancer> what you're gonna have to do is detect when params have been changed and re-build the flash object each time
[15:25:58] <saimon69> the base was the same
[15:26:06] <necromancer> so when someone changes a param, remove the flash object and then re-embed it with the different info
[15:26:18] <saimon69> just did not wanted to have a PHP that generates the stuff
[15:26:31] <Fidelix> necromancer, did you take a look?
[15:26:31] <necromancer> you don't have to use php..
[15:26:31] <saimon69> (the way i used ajax so far)
[15:26:54] <necromancer> Fidelix: what issues are you having with it?
[15:27:02] <keyo> avoid using php if you can
[15:27:29] <Fidelix> necromancer, this doesn't work on IE. Nothing.
[15:27:37] <Fidelix> And it works on all other browsers
[15:28:00] <Fidelix> Sorry, IE8
[15:28:05] <nguyendh> i have problem where a jquery ui datepicker reset the year to min when i select a month from dropdown . anyidea what causes this ?
[15:31:26] <keyo> IE7 + Fancybox = hopeless. I can't even load the same div into the popup as the other browsers
[15:34:37] <saimon69> neuromancer: removed all the insert script stuff, i make now work the function directly and so far seems to work

[15:58:00] <KWhat_Work> I have added a mouse move listener to a div tag and it works well except that it keeps working after im not longer moving above that tag.  Is that the designed behavor?

[16:08:08] <Diverdude> i am reading a value from a text area which a user enters and putting it in the database. How can i check if the string i read from the text area contains HTML or javascript?
[16:08:55] <snover> you canâ€™t
[16:09:00] <Diverdude> snover, ?
[16:09:46] <Diverdude> snover, please be serious'
[16:09:49] <snover> you can make a heuristic guess but there is no way to be sure that it is intended to be js or html without the user making their request explicit
[16:10:45] <snover> If I write â€œ2 < 5 > 3â€, thatâ€™s not HTML, but a naÃ¯ve function might think it is
[16:20:23] <gasull> erichynds: thanks (sorry, I had to go)
[16:21:00] <coldhead> blackboard: what the fuck, bro
[16:21:13] <coldhead> what the fucking fuck
[16:35:29] <GeoDud> http://shouldilearnjavascript.com/
[16:41:26] <keyo> Wtf is up with xml parsing in 1.4.2. It just won't work. It works great in 1.6
[16:41:36] <keyo> This is my $.ajax http://pastebin.com/83bwfsf6
[16:44:37] <erichynds> keyo, what does the XML look like?
[16:46:59] <freedrull> i am submitting an ajax request with .post, on a form, using .submit. then i replaced the form with a new form, with the same id. but the .submit doesn't seem to be called the second time around, even though it has the same id. http://pastebin.com/87cVHNrH
[16:47:34] <coldhead> ?live @ freedrull
[16:47:34] <bot-t> freedrull, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:47:44] <coldhead> the "in the future" bit applies to you
[16:47:52] <freedrull> coldhead: bot-t: thanks
[16:48:08] <freedrull> thought i might need something else since im only doing this in document.ready
[16:48:28] <coldhead> yes, jQuery anticipated your needs :)
[16:52:17] <coldhead> lol sony again
[16:56:41] <keyo> erichynds: I'll put some xml in a pastebin, 1min
[16:57:27] <keyo> erichynds: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/S1olrRVnttpb5PUhjLyd/
[16:58:28] <erichynds> analysis is your root node so find won't work
[16:58:43] <erichynds> try just $(data).find('Item')
[17:00:08] <keyo> erichynds: okay. interesting that 1.6 lets me do that
[17:00:22] <erichynds> i could be wrong
[17:00:55] <keyo> it still errors out :/
[17:01:07] <keyo> xml is valid
[17:01:32] <erichynds> are you sending it as text/xml or application/xml ?
[17:01:54] <keyo> probably just text, I never set any header
[17:02:29] <erichynds> well, 1.5+ has the ability to convert text to XML, which is probably why it works
[17:02:49] <erichynds> 1.4 relies on responseXML which won't exist if you're not sending it down as XML
[17:03:17] <keyo> yeah, I did have to set dataType to xml in 1.6, so that makes sense
[17:05:03] <keyo> erichynds: Thanks mate, the new header did the job
[17:05:10] <erichynds> cool
[17:11:05] <agib> alright this is killing me... I have this html: <form target="foo" method="post" ...>...</form> <iframe name="foo" ...></iframe> and I'm using jQuery("form").submit() to populate the iframe... now, this works in all browsers except IE7 thinks that it's a popup... anyone know why this might be?
[17:12:15] <snover> agib: what does that mean, thinks it is a popup?
[17:13:02] <agib> snover: I get the yellow bar (this site is trying to open a popup window...) and when I hit allow, it opens my post response in a new window instead of the iframe
[17:13:43] <Replayer> djquery
[17:14:07] <Replayer> Ah, not around
[17:14:41] <Replayer> I have this page here I've created: http://127.0.0.1/JQPT.html#JQPT.html
[17:14:45] <Replayer> er
[17:15:02] <Replayer> http://www.runningfromcode.com/Testing/JQPT.html#JQPT.html
[17:15:23] <Replayer> Im trying to have it maintain the 100% height, but not sure what event to bind on
[17:15:40] <snover> agib: ie8 works properly?
[17:15:40] <Replayer> the page is loaded with ajax, so I'm not really sure what to do
[17:16:27] <agib> snover: yeah... hmm I'm trying to do it the way facebook does it on facebook pages with iframes...
[17:16:31] <agib> ie8 works
[17:17:29] <agib> on facebook ie7 works... and my proof of concept works too in ie7: https://github.com/agibralter/iframe-widget-test
[17:18:01] <snover> soâ€¦it works but it doesnâ€™t work?
[17:18:05] <snover> wat?
[17:20:26] <agib> snover: sorry -- my brain is fried -- Yeah, so the way facebook does it works in all browsers. I made a proof of concept (iframe-widget-test) and it also works in all browsers. Now, I'm developing my real application and it doesn't work in ie7
[17:20:49] <snover> so what is different?
[17:20:53] <keyo> I am trying to get the width & height of a hidden element. Should it always be 0 if it is hidden
[17:20:54] <agib> I'm guessing there's a small discrepancy between my app and my proof of concept... but I can't seem to find anything
[17:21:07] <agib> was wondering if anyone had seen that problem with IE7 before
[17:24:03] <imanc> is there such thing as a decent step through javascript debugger?
[17:24:28] <snover> yes.
[17:27:39] <imanc> snover: where?
[17:27:42] <KWhat_Work> keyo: depends how its 'hidden', check the display
[17:27:54] <snover> imanc: in every cope of chrome on the planet
[17:27:59] <snover> copy*
[17:30:46] <notuo> Hi. Need some help with this sample:http://216.59.5.83/~talento/t2.html the  gray div/frame shows for a moment and then starts the animation. I need just the animation.
[17:37:43] <keyo> notuo, so don't put an animation on the show()
[17:38:02] <keyo> notuo: Do you just want it to face
[17:38:04] <keyo> fade*
[17:38:55] <notuo> @keyo I need the animation. (the movement to land in the final place) and the fade in is optional
[17:39:39] <keyo> notuo I see what you mean. Can't you just .hide() before you show it
[17:40:07] <keyo> put a .hide() before the .delay()
[17:40:23] <notuo> @keyo, let me try
[17:41:13] <keyo> notuo: $("div#text-wrap").hide().delay(500).show("puff", {}, 500);
[17:42:25] <notuo> @keyo, that worked for the "blink" but now the text inside the div  is not centered.
[18:00:49] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[18:01:54] <ch3mical> What's the best way to generate xml elements in jquery? Can you do it the same as html elements? i.e. $('<xml/>',{ text: "blah" }); or use wrap, etc?
[18:02:08] <wkmanire> probly
[18:02:33] <xcaliber> hey, does anybody know how to change the selector name in jquery?
[18:02:55] <wkmanire> xcaliber: As in change $ to something else?
[18:03:13] <xcaliber> nope, say I had <div id="something">
[18:03:30] <xcaliber> can i go like $('#something') = #something_else?
[18:04:46] <ch3mical> What are you trying to accomplish, exactly?
[18:04:47] <snover> xcaliber: you canâ€™t assign to an expression
[18:04:50] <snover> it makes no sense
[18:05:08] <xcaliber> im trying to change the name of $('#something')
[18:05:13] <xcaliber> in the actual HTML code
[18:05:30] <wkmanire> xcaliber: So you want change the tagName of the element with ID soemthing?
[18:05:36] <xcaliber> yeah
[18:05:37] <ch3mical> $('#something').attr('id','somethingelse');
[18:05:41] <xcaliber> ooh
[18:05:42] <xcaliber> thx
[18:05:51] <ch3mical> Is that what you want?
[18:05:54] <xcaliber> yep :D
[18:05:56] <xcaliber> i think
[18:06:14] <xcaliber> the reason is because i'm coding a expand/collapse button w/ .show() and .hide()
[18:06:31] <wkmanire> Why would you change the ID for that?
[18:06:37] <ch3mical> What he said ^
[18:06:37] <xcaliber> because it's the same button i guess
[18:07:11] <ch3mical> See ?toggle @ xcaliber
[18:07:11] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[18:07:22] <xcaliber> ooh
[18:07:23] <xcaliber> thanks!
[18:07:37] <wkmanire> $( "#something" ).click( function () {$( "#somethingElse" ).toggle() } );
[18:07:48] <wkmanire> Or something like that
[18:08:08] <ch3mical> wkmanire: I don't think that's what he wants
[18:08:34] <wkmanire> Alternate the click handler instead?
[18:08:42] <xcaliber> actually toggler worked
[18:08:46] <xcaliber> toggle*
[18:08:50] <ch3mical> wkmanire: It seems like he thought he couldn't bind multiple events to the same object, but what he wants to do is have one button control the visibility of another element alternately, like with toggle
[18:09:12] <xcaliber> i tried slideToggle but it seemed to lag a lot
[18:09:16] <ch3mical> He was trying to reinvent the wheel
[18:09:36] <xcaliber> i have 3 rows in a table hidden, but slide toggle kinda makes my rows bounce lol
[18:09:39] <wkmanire> ah ok.
[18:09:46] <xcaliber> is there a way to fix that lag?
[18:09:48] <wkmanire> I'm guilty of that more often than I care to admit
[18:10:07] <ch3mical> We all do lol
[18:10:38] <xcaliber> have you guys experienced the slideToggle() lag?
[18:10:50] <xcaliber> it doesn't really bring my rows down smoothly lol
[18:11:12] <wkmanire> try slideToggle("fast") or slideToggle(0)
[18:11:17] <ch3mical> xcaliber: it's an animation effect, so there's a timing involved, which you may be mistakenly seeing as lag
[18:11:32] <xcaliber> i mean i know how the animation looks like
[18:11:35] <ch3mical> There's no point in doing slidetoggle with 0 duration
[18:11:39] <ch3mical> Just toggle hide/show
[18:11:41] <wkmanire> yep
[18:12:17] <ch3mical> Hey, I was working, damnit, stop making me answer questions! ;p
[18:12:57] <wkmanire> ch3mical: :D
[18:17:38] <xcaliber> how long did it take you guys to learn jquery?
[18:17:48] <Rotham> hey.. how can I make "jQuery("#menu ul li")" so it selects "#menu2 ul li" also?
[18:18:09] <Rotham> or should I just repeat the code?
[18:18:31] <xcaliber> .next()
[18:18:41] <paul_irish> xcaliber: a few monthssss
[18:19:03] <xcaliber> Rotham: jquery can only select 1 element at a time
[18:19:21] <Rotham> xcaliber: thanks
[18:19:21] <xcaliber> if you want it to select the whole bunch, try putting something that wraps around it
[18:20:20] <wkmanire> xcaliber: It takes a long time to figure out how to use javascript correctly for most.
[18:20:56] <xcaliber> i still don't know how to correctly use javascript :D
[18:21:00] <xcaliber> just went straight to jquery.
[18:21:42] <wkmanire> You'll get more out of jQuery if you learn javascript first. You'll appreciate even more how many of the headaches jquery alleviates.
[18:22:29] <xcaliber> haha, i've been told how much headache jquery alleviates from javascript
[18:22:34] <xcaliber> that's why im avoiding it :P
[18:23:51] <Replayer> http://www.runningfromcode.com/Testing/JQPT.html : My problem is that when I click the "confirm answer button" I want the page that is loaded to still use the fixgeometry function to reposition the bottom bar. Any tips?

[18:26:17] <wkmanire> This demo seems to have it right
[18:26:25] <Replayer> xenyz: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/#usage
[18:26:38] <Replayer> wkmanire, thats what I found originally
[18:26:55] <xenyz> "the most awesome jquery image slider" heh
[18:26:57] <Replayer> the only issue is that when you hop pages, the fixgeometry function won't run again
[18:27:11] <Replayer> I just need to think of how to call the function for the page loaded via ajax
[18:28:06] <xenyz> Replayer: well, it's not boring that's for sure. thanks
[18:28:22] <Replayer> No problem!
[18:29:03] <wkmanire> I'm not that familiar with jQuery Mobile to be honest, but from what I can remember jQuery mobile puts both page's documents into the DOM at the same time to perform the transition.
[18:29:18] <xenyz> Replayer: MIT license too, woot.
[18:29:41] <Replayer> I know, I researched for a good slideshow-er when I needed one
[18:30:01] <wkmanire> So you probably need to hook into a callback event for when it completes displaying the new content and then just call fixgeometry again
[18:30:01] <cgcardona> Anyone know a way offhand to use jquery to modify a value in a loaded css file? In this case the css file is loaded already and I want to change some css in it so that anything that gets added to the DOM will get the change automatically
[18:30:02] <cgcardona> rather than using jquery to modify the css on the dom objects themselves
[18:30:06] <Replayer> right wkmanire, which is why I tried to stack the events to run ahead of time
[18:30:16] <xenyz> I found jquery cycle before but I think I'm going to try nivo instead.
[18:30:37] <Replayer> cgcardona, perhaps specify 2 classes in the css, and use jquery to change an element's class.
[18:31:00] <wkmanire> Replayer, cgcardona: It is possible to manipulate the CSS DOM directly.
[18:31:34] <wkmanire> I'm trying to find an example
[18:31:44] <ch3mical> Ok, how do I create an element like this $('<media:content'); ? It complains about the colon
[18:32:06] <clem> Hello.please look these code. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/399834/
[18:32:07] <clem> I want to show the link when I move mouse on the picture and hide the link when move out of the picture.
[18:32:09] <clem> But I do not know how to select the below link,I just can select all link with a class.Please help me.
[18:32:13] <ch3mical> oops, I meant $('<media:content/>')
[18:33:46] <wkmanire> dammit, I can't find it. I know its possible, I've seen it before.
[18:37:50] <clem> <table><tbody><tr><td><a class=moveonit></a></td></tr></tbody></table>       <div><a class=hideit></a></div>
[18:37:51] <clem> If a.moveonit is $(this),how can I select a.hideit?
[18:38:38] <wkmanire> cgcardona: I'm pretty sure the native API object you'll be editing is an instance of CSSStyleSheet
[18:38:58] <wkmanire> cgcardona: Go into the chrome console and type dir(CSSStyleSheet)
[18:39:02] <wkmanire> You'll see what I'm talkinga bout
[18:39:05] <wkmanire> about*
[18:39:13] <wkmanire> I'm looking now to find out how to get at the actual isntances.
[18:39:26] <cgcardona> cool. thanks
[18:40:34] <wkmanire> instances*
[18:41:39] <wkmanire> cgcardona: There it is document.styleSheets
[18:41:59] <wkmanire> it has a complete API for modifying the applied style sheets on the page.
[18:43:08] <clem> <div><a class=foo></a><div>,if a.foo is $(this),how can I select the <div>?
[18:43:16] <cgcardona> awesome thanks
[18:43:37] <wkmanire> cgcardona: document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].style
[18:43:57] <wkmanire> cgcardona: I think that gets you right to the meat of things
[18:44:06] <cgcardona> very cool. :)
[18:44:07] <cgcardona> thanks
[18:44:10] <wkmanire> No problem
[18:44:23] <b1lly> with the jquery ui, sortable. I'm trying to grab the parent of the element that was dropped
[18:45:07] <b1lly> right now i'm doing $('selector').sortable ({ update: function(event,ui) { parent_id = $(ui.item).parent(); } }); and its not returning correctly
[18:48:16] <pixeltarian> Does anyone know the best practice for placing a URL within a page? as in, I want a link back to the "main site" but don't want to use a frame.
[18:50:41] <JmZ> pixeltarian what do you mean, can you give an example
[18:50:50] <pixeltarian> well, back in the day...
[18:50:56] <pixeltarian> I'd use iframe
[18:51:06] <pixeltarian> and put a website within the website
[18:51:08] <JmZ> to do what though? i mean an example of what you're trying to do
[18:51:15] <pixeltarian> oh
[18:51:38] <JmZ> 'a link back to the main site' is what im not understanding
[18:51:45] <pixeltarian> let's see... long story short. I want everyone in the artist co-op I live in to have kick ass online art portfolios
[18:51:53] <pixeltarian> so I'm going to get them all cargocollective sites
[18:52:04] <pixeltarian> but their domain will be their unit number
[18:52:27] <pixeltarian> EG joe lives in 103 so he's url will be 103.artistcoopsite.com
[18:52:50] <pixeltarian> but I want the visitor to be able to get back to the artist co-op site
[18:53:03] <pixeltarian> and not just get redirected to cargocollective.com/joessite
[18:53:25] <pixeltarian> does that make sense I should I muster more brain power and try to articulate better?
[18:53:52] <JmZ> lol kind of but its like 3am here so concentration is low right now
[18:53:58] <pixeltarian> oh and for reference
[18:53:59] <pixeltarian> http://cargocollective.com/
[18:54:05] <pixeltarian> cargo is a CMS for artists
[18:54:11] <JmZ> in any case, the alternative to an iframe would just be to use AJAX to set the content of a container
[18:54:33] <JmZ> although, it won't work crossdomain i guess
[18:54:50] <awongh> anyone know the template plugin?
[18:55:10] <awongh> my browser is crashing when i remove the template elements.....
[18:55:13] <devil2005> hello, i installed wp-e-commerce and i get this error, jQuery("form.product_form").livequery is not a function , ive never used live query, is there a typo in this code? http://pastie.org/2011669
[18:56:40] <pixeltarian> maybe I should just make it easy on myself and just <target="_blank"> it
[18:56:51] <pixeltarian> not as nice and fancy but way less of a headache
[18:57:10] <pixeltarian> iframe type business annoys most users, I suspect.
[18:58:14] <JmZ> oh how fun my screen randomly decided to black out for several seconds
[18:58:48] <iszak> JmZ, yeah didn't you know, monitors now have auto-censor built in.
[18:59:11] <iszak> it uses a complex algorithm to detect whether a naked body is being displayed or not and blacks out your monitor.
[19:00:14] <iszak> no one steal that idea, I'm going to patent it.
[19:05:25] <b1lly> why when i use .parent() it's returning "Object Object"
[19:05:28] <b1lly> when I alert the value
[19:05:49] <iszak> b1lly, use console.log() instead
[19:05:58] <iszak> if you want to alert use something like .attr('id') or so
[19:09:04] <b1lly> iszak i want to get the parent().attr('id');
[19:09:48] <iszak> so then do .parent().attr('id')
[19:12:14] <systemfault> haha
[19:20:04] <b1lly> how do i break an element out of its parent?
[19:21:06] <b1lly> unwrap removes all elements iwthin the parent
[19:21:13] <b1lly> i just want to remove 1 element from the container
[19:23:09] <ryanseddon> b1lly: you can use detach() or remove()
[19:24:13] <b1lly> detach removes it all together?
[19:24:20] <b1lly> i just want to take it out of the parent
[19:24:51] <ryanseddon> and put the element where?
[19:25:53] <b1lly> outside it
[19:25:56] <b1lly> so for example if i have an
[19:26:22] <b1lly> <div> <span></span> </div> and i wanted to just remove <span> from its parent so that it was <div></div><span></span>
[19:26:43] <b1lly> do i need to detatch and than append?
[19:26:54] <Brodingo> after
[19:26:56] <Brodingo> not append
[19:26:56] <badlands> is this a good irc channel to discuss working the html canvas? I will be manipulating it with jquery.
[19:27:07] <agib> snover: I FIGURED IT OUT!
[19:27:19] <snover> figured what out?
[19:27:20] <agib> :) so just for the general edification of the room...
[19:27:25] <agib> the iframe post problem
[19:27:29] <agib> in IE7...
[19:28:34] <agib> snover: I was building the iframe HTML with $("<iframe>", {name: "foo" ... });
[19:28:52] <b1lly> Brodingo: ? i'm sry
[19:29:02] <b1lly> using after just keeps it within the container?
[19:29:08] <agib> IE7 doesn't recognize elements that don't have the name hard coded in
[19:29:22] <agib> it needed to be $("<iframe name="foo">")
[19:29:24] <agib> I shit you not...
[19:29:31] <agib> wtf is up with IE?
[19:29:36] <ryanseddon> b1lly: to move the span outside of div $("div").after("span")
[19:49:10] <devil2005> can anyone recommend a simple collapsable tree menu multi-payer?
[19:49:26] <devil2005> multi-layer*
[19:54:49] <ganiman> hello
[20:08:12] <b1lly> lets say i have an array = {"test","test2","test3" };
[20:08:22] <b1lly> is there a way to check the array to see if $string is in $array
[20:08:34] <b1lly> if ($string in($array)) {
[20:09:29] <snover> b1lly: that ainâ€™t an array bro.
[20:12:29] <b1lly> regardless, how do I check an array for a string
[20:13:19] <snover> b1lly: go read the api docs please
[20:14:41] <jafin> try http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[20:36:51] <Shai-Tan> I have a $(document).ready(function() { ... and wish this to be run onclick. How do I change this?
[20:38:25] <zpoley> extract the function part into a named function and call that function $("#someelement").click(funcName)
[20:39:05] <Shai-Tan> I have a bunch of buttons, can I do like $("button").click(function() { ?
[20:39:46] <zpoley> you want to take the function part out like: function funcName() { â€¦ }
[20:40:02] <zpoley> then you can do $("button").click(funcName)
[20:40:52] <Shai-Tan> so like $("button").click(requestData() {
[20:42:08] <KWhat_Mobile> was there a way to umbind all evnets in a namespace ?
[20:42:26] <zpoley> Shai-Tan: i would do it like this: http://pastie.org/2011961
[20:43:06] <Shai-Tan> zpoley: ok, thanks
[20:43:17] <zpoley> Shai-Tan: sure np
[20:52:36] <Whirl3d> good evening all, What's your favorite way to embed video on a webpage for full-page video? Anbody know of any good jQuery solutions?
[20:53:34] <ColKurtz> HTML5 video or flash?
[20:53:57] <ColKurtz> or both
[20:54:02] <Whirl3d> ColKurtz,  thnx for the reply. I guess html5 with a flash fallback..
[20:54:19] <ColKurtz> you could use YepNope.js to test for HTMl5 video (i think)
[20:54:31] <ColKurtz> and load the appropriate JS to embed that
[20:54:58] <Whirl3d> Right now I am using Video For Everbody...but all of the players have controls. I want a controllerless video to play full screen
[20:54:59] <ColKurtz> and if HTML5 video isn't enabled then you can load swfobject and embed the flash player
[20:55:09] <snover> why the christ would you load swfobject just to embed a video player
[20:55:16] <ColKurtz> idk
[20:55:23] <ColKurtz> i haven't embedded video in a while
[20:55:27] <ColKurtz> or even messed around with HTML5 video
[20:55:33] <ColKurtz> lol
[20:56:04] <ColKurtz> how about flowplayer? http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html
[20:56:14] <ColKurtz> http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html
[20:56:26] <ColKurtz> copy paste fail. http://flowplayer.org/index.html
[20:56:36] <Whirl3d> It's a tired request, but my friend wants to have a landing page with a "click here to enter" button that plays a short intro video full screen. I can't quite get it to work.
[20:56:57] <snover> Whirl3d: so your friend wants their site to suck and drive away its audience, is what you are saying
[20:57:15] <ColKurtz> he should just feature the video with a play button on his home page
[20:57:15] <Whirl3d> Yes, and I have tried and tried to talk him out of it. No go
[20:57:23] <Whirl3d> It loses the effect
[20:57:30] <ColKurtz> you can have a nice design that makes the video really prominent
[20:57:43] <ColKurtz> but lets you scroll down to see more home page content
[20:57:54] <snover> what effect is that? â€œdear visitor, i hate you and i want you to feel pain?â€
[20:57:57] <Whirl3d> The effect looks like you are being drawn into the site through the logo in 3D. It's a cute intro, but it's tired.
[20:58:21] <ColKurtz> that is terrible
[20:58:22] <snover> Whirl3d: this is the point at which you say â€œbro, I am the expert and I am trying to keep you from making a terrible mistakeâ€
[20:58:32] <snover> â€œyou hired me because I do this for a livingâ€
[20:59:16] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your response. I have even given him articles that explain in detail what a bad idea it is and his heart is set on it.
[20:59:26] <coldhead> they hired me to help them navigate through a diverse and increasingly fragmented media landscape
[20:59:42] <coldhead> return on investment not found
[20:59:45] <snover> â€œif I came to you for help with [whatever the fuck your friend does] and I said I wanted to do [whatever] the wrong way, I would respect you when you told me I was in error; why donâ€™t you pay me the same respect?â€
[21:00:25] <sdio> heaven forbid we just let him fuck up his site.
[21:00:44] <coldhead> you have no love in your heart, sdio
[21:00:47] <Hierofant> Hi.  Why isn't this ##jquery?
[21:00:52] <sdio> irc really has gone downhill.
[21:00:54] <Whirl3d> If I hadn't already been through this about a hundred times, I'd be more willing to try it again. But honestly, at this point, I'm sick of fighting him on it.
[21:01:03] <snover> Hierofant: because it is the official jquery channel.
[21:01:26] <Hierofant> says who?
[21:01:26] <sdio> Whirl3d: I support your friend.
[21:01:33] <snover> Hierofant: says the jquery project?
[21:01:49] <Whirl3d> sdio, thx. He's old and stuck in his ways.
[21:02:08] <sdio> Make sure to throw in plenty of <blink>
[21:02:15] <Hierofant> snover oh, ok.  officialness is not always obvious
[21:02:35] <Whirl3d> The entire site is really cheesey, actually. Considering he's an attorney with the name Wolfe...it looks more like a wildlife website than an attorney's website
[21:02:46] <sdio> That's the problem I have with almost every site these days is.. not enough <blink>.
[21:02:50] <sdio> Moar <blink>!
[21:02:55] <ColKurtz> LMFAO it's an attorney's website
[21:03:01] <Whirl3d> exactly.
[21:03:14] <ColKurtz> tell him to find you a good well-known attorney or firm with a website that has an intro video like htat.
[21:03:22] <coldhead> its probably not even relevant, Hierofant, channels can be unofficially good or officially shite, too
[21:03:31] <Whirl3d> But if you've seen any other attorney website, it is a LOT better looking than anything else out there
[21:03:46] <sdio> Does it have a background of stars?
[21:03:59] <Hierofant> heh well this one's amazing.. far beyond good.  I just noticed many channels on freenode are stuck with ## when there's no such thing as "official"
[21:04:12] <sdio> possibly with a <blink>REACH FOR THE STARS WITH US</blink?
[21:04:16] <sdio> <h2>?
[21:04:33] <sdio> +>
[21:04:55] <ColKurtz> are you a designer Whirl3d ? or coder?
[21:05:22] <Whirl3d> I would say that I'm a designer, but I do all my own code
[21:05:37] <sdio> Why is nobody with me on this? :(
[21:05:44] <sdio> bros before hos, people.
[21:05:46] <ColKurtz> oh ok
[21:06:04] <snover> sdio: I donâ€™t like to give people the gun with which they shoot themselves (or their clients)
[21:06:09] <snover> especially if it is for a lawyer
[21:06:10] <ColKurtz> b/c i was gonna say, you can get a really nice looking template or theme from a vendor
[21:06:14] <snover> good luck with that Whirl3d
[21:06:18] <ColKurtz> that would be perfect for an attorney's website
[21:06:25] <coldhead> i don't think blink works anymore, sdio
[21:06:31] <Whirl3d> Regardless, if you look at ANY attorney website, it's the same bullshit reworked with a different pathetic theme. Ours is at least more visually appealing.
[21:06:32] <sdio> wtf?
[21:06:49] <Whirl3d> That's what he wants to avoid.
[21:06:51] <coldhead> i'm not sure attorney's need websites
[21:06:54] <sdio> coldhead: http://isblink.partofhtml5.com/
[21:06:59] <ColKurtz> oh
[21:06:59] <ColKurtz> haha
[21:07:02] <ColKurtz> i misread
[21:07:13] <snover> WE WILL CHARGE YOU UP THE ASS FOR OUR LEGAL CONSULTATION. EXPECT TO PAY AT LEAST $500 PER HOUR. AND YOU WILL ENJOY IT.
[21:07:17] <ColKurtz> Whirl3d: But if you've seen any other attorney website, it is a LOT better looking than anything else out there
[21:07:41] <coldhead> i don't think blink works WITH JS DISABLED anymore, sdio
[21:07:53] <ColKurtz> for some reason i thought i read the opposite, that it didn't even look good for an attorney site
[21:08:04] <Whirl3d> lol
[21:08:13] <ColKurtz> can i see it?
[21:08:15] <coldhead> i have loved a few attorneys in my time
[21:08:22] <coldhead> and none of them needed websites
[21:08:32] <Whirl3d> lemme see if any of the parts are posted. brb
[21:08:32] <sdio> coldhead: I'm not bored enough to check.
[21:08:38] <coldhead> they just need a car that can keep pace with an ambulance
[21:08:56] <sdio> We should have cruiser-chasin' attorneys.
[21:11:01] <Whirl3d> here is a rough draft. The art is not finished and the pieces have changed a bit, but the layout and concept are the same. This is one of 3 sections, rough, mind you:
[21:11:02] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/yourcase/index-5.html#concepts
[21:12:06] <amid_hasan> Whirl3D same goes for dental websites. Most are same sh** template by the same company with little to no information about the actual practice.
[21:13:04] <Whirl3d> yup. But with an attorney, sometimes it's just important to look good
[21:13:23] <Whirl3d> Here is the intro video (also rough)....and cheesey!
[21:13:25] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/intro/intro.swf
[21:13:40] <amid_hasan> Whild3d: totally agree.
[21:13:43] <sdio> Whirl3d: atleast have an option to turn off all the animations.
[21:13:51] <sdio> Whirl3d: then slowly convince him to set that to the default.
[21:14:02] <sdio> small steps.
[21:14:42] <amid_hasan> Wow. Did you make that yourself?
[21:14:50] <Whirl3d> Yes
[21:15:08] <amid_hasan> Great job!
[21:15:43] <Whirl3d> thanks. It's not done yet. But thanks. It's pretty dynamic too, so it'll work well with any subject in the future.
[21:15:59] <Whirl3d> You could easily have teeth fly-in for a dentist, for example. LOL
[21:16:46] <amid_hasan> I'm actually working on one custom dental website now. Doing a appointment system that integrates with the business's smartphone/email and auto alerts doc of emergencies
[21:16:59] <amid_hasan> Simple on the front end, powerful backend
[21:17:09] <Whirl3d> Now that's real work. wow
[21:17:13] <amid_hasan> I've simplified everything
[21:17:36] <amid_hasan> No need for long paragraphs. Few sentences, large font. Benefits and what works
[21:18:10] <amid_hasan> Thanks to cron jobs I can automate a lot here
[21:18:17] <amid_hasan> jquery for the front end stuff
[21:18:46] <Whirl3d> Sounds like a huge project, though. Are you starting with a framework?
[21:19:14] <amid_hasan> No. I'm using my own stack. Most of it is coded from scratch
[21:19:16] <ColKurtz> that intro looks more appropriate for a film production company in movie credits
[21:19:25] <ColKurtz> not an attorney's website
[21:19:27] <ColKurtz> tho it looks good.
[21:19:35] <amid_hasan> Whirl3d: I have some sites that you can get ideas from
[21:19:51] <amid_hasan> http://www.mofo.com/ is the big one
[21:20:01] <amid_hasan> top corporate/ otherwise big money firm
[21:20:19] <ColKurtz> Whirl3d: the bouncing animation is a bit much for me. a clean fade or swipe would look good though.
[21:20:25] <amid_hasan> http://www.orrick.com/ another
[21:20:30] <Whirl3d> ColKurtz, I agree. You should see the Pulp Fiction piece that I had to pull....and recently i edited a southpark episode to have his likeness added to a scene on Hate Crimes..
[21:20:45] <tbranyen> i hate crime
[21:22:50] <Whirl3d> amid_hasan, that mofo site is nice, clean, simple. I wish I could talk my friend into something clean and attractive like that.
[21:23:23] <Whirl3d> Here is his current website: http://www.ldavidwolfe.com
[21:23:38] <Whirl3d> <--not mine. It's horrendous, imo
[21:24:06] <teadict> I've got this textarea inside a PrettyPhoto... I can't get its value.. it's like the property doesn't exist ^.-
[21:26:26] <Whirl3d> teadict, I assume that PrettyPhoto is a plugin or something?
[21:26:44] <teadict> http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/
[21:26:51] <amid_hasan> Whirl3d: I can make a kick-a$$ site. How much can you pay me?
[21:29:08] <Whirl3d> Did I mention that I am doing this for a friend? LOL I wish I could pay you, I like your work. Unfortunately, I'm helping him out because he saved a friend's ass who almost went to jail for 40+ years for drugs.
[21:29:10] <teadict> Whirl3d: 'tis weird.. $("input:text").val() no problems.. $("textarea").val() notghin.. but I checked the dom object, it has no value anywhere.. nor a property that holds the value I write into it..
[21:30:21] <amid_hasan> Whirl3d: search some law sites to get the idea
[21:30:33] <amid_hasan> its all about alignment with law sites
[21:30:36] <teadict> wait, the value is there.. wth...
[21:34:32] <Whirl3d> amid_hasan, that's exactly what he's trying to avoid. 99% of the websites out there use recycled content and templates. Which recently Google announced that recycled content will get lower ratings...
[21:35:35] <amid_hasan> Um, I mean to get inspiration
[21:35:40] <amid_hasan> Not content.
[21:35:46] <amid_hasan> Google itself is spamming the web
[21:35:55] <Whirl3d> amen
[21:35:55] <amid_hasan> the make it so disorganized
[21:36:37] <amid_hasan> I'm surprised that they make several billion dollars every 4 months on this
[21:37:01] <amid_hasan> And they don't even produce any of the content
[21:37:04] <amid_hasan> its web developers
[21:37:11] <amid_hasan> that allow their sites to be crawled
[21:38:13] <luckydev> amid_hasan: try downloading all of the sites in this planet and write an algorithm to find a word in those trillion sites
[21:38:28] <luckydev> member:amid_hasan: search is a very hard problem.
[21:38:50] <amid_hasan> you cannot download a site if it is not visible to you
[21:39:24] <Whirl3d> they could start charging a penny per search and they'd make a billions a day probably.
[21:39:41] <dsdeiz> hi! how do i disable image selection?
[21:40:05] <Whirl3d> dsdeiz, are you trying to keep people from pilfering images?
[21:41:03] <dsdeiz> nah just wanted to remove the highlight
[21:41:11] <dsdeiz> when they select it a blue highlight appears
[21:41:21] <Whirl3d> fix that in css
[21:41:30] <dsdeiz> yeah, found it.. thx
[21:41:31] <agib> so... my css has "filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=30)" for IE... It doesn't seem like jquery's IE opacity plays nice with this... it expects alpha=...
[21:47:48] <ionico> hi
[21:48:38] <b1lly> is there a way to put 2 selectors on an event listener
[21:49:08] <ionico> how can i reach an input inside a div with jquery ?
[21:49:16] <b1lly> reach an input?
[21:50:18] <b1lly> nm got it
[21:50:22] <b1lly> ionico what do you mean
[21:50:28] <b1lly> reach an input?
[21:50:35] <ionico> yes,  i what to get the value of an input   <div id=id1><input value=1>   </div>
[21:51:12] <b1lly> $('#id1 input').val() ?
[21:51:46] <b1lly> alert($('#id1 input').attr('value')); ?
[21:53:06] <ionico> ok, letme try like you say
[22:04:32] <Ganymede> Can someone help me with this code segment? http://jsfiddle.net/CPrcG/ <-- The update function here gets called with about 500 milliseconds between each call. However, in Google Chrome's developer tools console, I see a bunch of "GET http://mydomain.com/undefined 404 (Not Found)" How can it possibly be fetching "undefined" over and over again if I explicitly gave it a string literal to fetch?
[22:07:00] <entr> i'm using .stopImmediatePropagation() to prevent already assigned handlers from exec
[22:07:31] <entr> but it doesn't stop handlers set before .stopImmediatePropagation()
[22:07:34] <entr> is that normal ?
[22:09:21] <da-beginner> hi all.. is there a way to attach an event to an element that is yet to be loaded into the page?
[22:10:07] <entr> da-beginner: well .load is a good example of that
[22:11:12] <Ganymede> I think you meant .live()
[22:11:55] <Ganymede> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:13:41] <Ganymede> Never mind my question, I'll try asking again in the morning.
[22:14:06] <entr> Ganymede: what was it?

[22:16:44] <brettgoulder> sup jquery!
[22:17:09] <entr> what jq version r u using?
[22:20:42] <Ganymede> entr, http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js
[22:24:01] <entr> then get your slideshow id like:
[22:24:21] <entr> slideshow_id = $('#index').data('slideshowid');
[22:29:03] <Ganymede> entr, Thanks for the advice but that's unrelated to the actual problem I'm having.
[22:36:17] <kataire> When using ui.droppable, is there any way to find out where the dropped element originated from?
[22:44:14] <da-beginner> can i do $('p.button').load(function(){ ...  }); ?
[22:44:46] <jonathansampson_> Just an idea, but could not append the parents name as a class to the draggable and then access it when dropped?
[22:45:34] <gnarf> kataire: yes, there is...
[22:45:48] <gnarf> kataire: a) have you looked at the "ui" object in the drop event?
[22:46:03] <gnarf> also, the "this" may or may not be what you are looking for
[22:46:15] <gnarf> I remember answering this for someone else not to long ago.
[22:47:03] <gnarf> kataire: also, what about checking the .parent() cuz i think unless you're using sortable, it doesn't actually move the element
[22:47:54] <da-beginner> can i do $('p.button').load(function(){ ...  }); ?
[22:48:01] <jonathansampson_> Good point, gnarf. Just depositions top and left?
[22:48:24] <jonathansampson_> Repositions, I meant. Darn iPad.
[22:48:54] <jonathansampson_> da-beginner: What are you trying to do? Load content on click?
[22:49:31] <da-beginner> jonathansampson_: i want to bind a click function on a p.button element that is yet to be loaded
[22:49:32] <Deele> LabrÄ«t. Good morning. Ð”Ð¾Ð±Ñ€Ð¾Ðµ ÑƒÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾!
[22:49:59] <jonathansampson_> da-beginner: You would use $.live() in that case.
[22:50:06] <da-beginner> hm ok
[22:50:44] <gnarf> see ?jQuery.live
[22:50:45] <jonathansampson_> That will auto-bind the event to any element matching the selector that comes into the DOM later.
[22:50:45] <bot-t> gnarf, .live() - Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:50:50] <gnarf> or even see ?delegate
[22:50:50] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:51:46] <jonathansampson_> Note, live can be costly since it listens to the entire document. Consider delegate, as gnarf said.
[22:52:11] <gnarf> da-beginner: https://gist.github.com/1003630 i have this kinda plugin looking thing
[22:52:48] <gnarf> which might be useful too... but a lot of cases live/delegate will do what you need
[22:53:46] <da-beginner> jonathansampson_: thanks i'll give this a try
[22:54:32] <kataire> gnarf: I am using a sortable, so it does get moved. I worked around it, though.
[22:54:50] <gnarf> kataire: try the "this" i think that was the original sortable
[22:55:34] <jonathansampson_> Wouldn't that refer to the sortable itself, rather than it's last parent?
[22:55:39] <da-beginner> gnarf: what is the advantage over live? your plugin
[22:55:49] <kataire> gnarf: Nope. it's the new target. But I found a different way to solve my problem without having to know the original parent.
[22:56:26] <gnarf> da-beginner: its actually not extremely similar to .live() -- just in the fact that you can use it to bind actions to "newContent()"
[22:56:36] <kataire> gnarf: I wanted to restrict the origin, but of course I can just use a not-selector
[22:56:53] <jonathansampson_> gnarf: So it
[22:57:04] <jonathansampson_> Oops
[22:57:23] <jonathansampson_> It listens for changes to things like .HTML and .text too?
[22:59:29] <gnarf> jonathansampson_: no, you call .newContent()
[22:59:34] <gnarf> when you want it to search
[22:59:43] <gnarf> and it will look for anything you bound via .newContent()
[23:00:22] <jonathansampson_> Ah.
[23:00:29] <gnarf> there is no magic way to detect new content, you explicitly direct it that there is new content
[23:01:00] <gnarf> $("li.test").newContent(function() { this.each(...); })
[23:01:13] <gnarf> searches for li.test and calls that function with the result
[23:01:24] <gnarf> then whenever you call .newContent()
[23:01:36] <gnarf> it looks for any "li.test" in the element and calls that function with the result
[23:01:57] <Deele> nice
[23:02:17] <gnarf> Yeah, I just started using it on one of my projects and its pretty fn awesome
[23:02:54] <gnarf> some things you can live or whatever, but when you want to like get some data from the element and like turn it into a ui widget or something
[23:03:02] <gnarf> thats when .newContent() helps a lot
[23:04:22] <jonathansampson> Was just checking out the gist you linked earlier.
[23:04:41] <gnarf> i just updated it
[23:04:48] <gnarf> mostly just rewriting comments
[23:04:58] <gnarf> added one feature i just noticed was missing ;)
[23:05:06] <gnarf> it was calling the callback for empty matches, which is pointless
[23:05:46] <jonathansampson> Just a formality for good measure ;)
[23:07:47] <jonathansampson> Well, I'm off to bed for some reading. Take care, Corey.
[23:10:34] <__machine> how do i resize a popup window to fit the size of the content (an image) exactly... or if the image is larger than the screen resolution, shrink the image (constraining proportions) and also resize the popup to fit the resized image?
[23:14:35] <da-beginner> is live() working in jquery1.4.2?
[23:18:26] <da-beginner> is live() working in jquery1.4.2?
[23:18:51] <gnarf> da-beginner: yes
[23:19:12] <gnarf> da-beginner: there might be bugs tho - it is a few versions behind
[23:19:28] <gnarf> da-beginner: see ?p if you have a specific case
[23:19:29] <bot-t> da-beginner, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/

[23:22:55] <da-beginner> when i run this via firebug, it doesn't complain
[23:23:03] <da-beginner> but when i put it in the js code and run it, it complains
[23:23:54] <munderwo> Hi all. Im trying to get the autocomplete functionality wirking in jquery-ui. but im getting an error from jquery-1.5.1.js that it has no method 'autocomplete' ... im a little confused about the status of autocomplete, is it still the way to autocomplete form fields?
[23:34:33] <da-beginner> how do i find out which jquery version a page is using?
[23:34:44] <da-beginner> can i do that from firebug?
[23:38:33] <da-beginner> ok.. so if i use jquery 1.2.6 and want to do a live( ) - like function, is it possible?
[23:39:14] <dytrivedi> 1.2.6!!
[23:39:22] <dytrivedi> umm
[23:39:28] <dytrivedi> hmm
[23:39:43] <dytrivedi> there's this livequery plugin, I think live() ain't there in 1.2.6
[23:39:54] <dytrivedi> but a better idea would be to use latest jQueries
[23:39:57] <da-beginner> yes live is not there
[23:39:59] <da-beginner> i cant
[23:40:11] <da-beginner> not enough time.. plenty of red tape in moving it to the latest version lol
[23:40:24] <dytrivedi> hmm so use livequery then
[23:42:45] <b1lly> why cant you pass an array thru a function
[23:43:49] <zpoley> you can
[23:43:49] <dytrivedi> wat
[23:47:08] <entr> is .stopImmediatePropagation() supposed to stop all handlers or just those following ?
[23:47:23] <entr> can't figure it out
[23:49:50] <munderwo> Hi all.. If I want to autocomplete a form field is the jquery-ui autocomplete() method the best way to do this?
