[00:00:12] <iksik> thanks ;-)
[00:01:21] <beachandbytes> .next wont get the child
[00:01:37] <Cork> beachandbytes: read up on the question
[00:02:01] <beachandbytes> ahh ya gotcha
[00:02:42] <Cork> well that comment isn't completely true as th is allowed too
[00:02:59] <Cork> but for what he wan't to do i don't think that matters
[00:10:35] <nesoi> so I'm trying to use this dialog function http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/button.html
[00:11:05] <nesoi> and I want to name the buttons something dynamically, but it isn't working. If I put a variable where the button name goes, it's just printing the variable name
[00:11:12] <nesoi> how would I get that to work?
[00:23:43] <nesoi> hm... no one here?
[00:24:12] <beachandbytes> some are
[00:24:42] <nesoi> :)
[00:25:59] <nesoi> beachandbytes : if you look at this example: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/button.html how would I use a variable for the button name? it accepts a string in '' but if I use a variable it is not taking the value of the variable
[00:28:50] <beachandbytes> you will have to be more specific with "name"
[00:29:01] <beachandbytes> do you mean html tag name, button text, id?
[00:29:33] <nesoi> beachandbytes : where it says 'OK' or 'Cancel' I want to have a variable which contains a string
[00:30:09] <nesoi> but if I put a variable there, it ignores the fact that it's a variable and just prints the variable name
[00:30:21] <beachandbytes> just substitute the stirings with variables
[00:30:25] <beachandbytes> nothing else needs to be done
[00:30:31] <nesoi> I tried that and it doesn't work
[00:30:39] <beachandbytes> can you post your code
[00:31:14] <nesoi> https://gist.github.com/rlad/8fe698e8940abb6f7b50
[00:31:51] <nesoi> I was hoping it would put "woo woo" on the button, but instead it puts 'testlabel' on the button
[00:34:06] <relipse>  https://play.google.com/store/search?q=cworklog <-- MY FIRST ANDROID APP!! CHECK IT (uses jquerymobile)
[00:35:31] <beachandbytes> newsoi i think you will have to use array syntax to set a variable propety
[00:35:31] <nesoi> relipse : phonegap?
[00:35:45] <nesoi> beachandbytes
[00:35:50] <nesoi> how would I do that?
[00:35:50] <fat> How do i get this to to work in jquery 1.9.1 http://jsfiddle.net/4nMkh/4/
[00:37:23] <beachandbytes> nesoi look at this
[00:37:24] <beachandbytes> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1464843/jquery-dialog-button-variable
[00:38:20] <nesoi> beachandbytes : I don't know how that would apply to this simpledialog2 though
[00:38:56] <beachandbytes> you need to create your button name the same way
[00:39:30] <beachandbytes> define it in array syntax first
[00:39:37] <beachandbytes> and then use it as a property
[00:39:40] <nesoi> beachandbytes : hmm.. I'm not following it actually
[00:40:40] <relipse> nesoi: yes
[00:41:14] <fat> helop?
[00:41:57] <beachandbytes> nesoi, everything inside of button: you need to define in object array sytnax
[00:42:19] <beachandbytes> just like the stackoverflow example
[00:42:34] <nesoi> which example? and then how do I pass it to simpledialog2?
[00:43:23] <nesoi> or is there another dialog plugin I should use?
[00:43:33] <beachandbytes> thats up to you really
[00:43:53] <beachandbytes> depending on how they implement the button text it will be equal or easier for yo
[00:43:57] <nesoi> beachandbytes : thanks, but I really have no idea still how to do it
[00:46:06] <nesoi> beachandbytes : what's an example of 'object array syntax' which I could use in this case?
[00:48:35] <beachandbytes> https://gist.github.com/beachandbytes/5011859
[00:48:43] <beachandbytes> try that nesoi
[00:50:10] <beachandbytes> refresh, meant to replace that string with the variable
[00:51:02] <beachandbytes> hopefully that helps
[00:52:04] <nesoi> so if you have several buttons you just do that for each one?
[00:52:12] <nesoi> what if you have a variable number of buttons?
[00:52:12] <beachandbytes> ya
[00:52:30] <nesoi> can you put that in a loop?
[00:52:34] <beachandbytes> sure
[00:52:44] <beachandbytes> do whatever you want to the array before the popup declaration
[00:52:51] <nesoi> cool, I was wondering how to deal with that
[00:53:19] <nesoi> and that should work no matter how simpledialog2 is implemented because we're just supplying it with the right data structure
[00:53:28] <nesoi> ?
[00:53:41] <beachandbytes> well as long as its 'string' : function () { }
[00:53:47] <beachandbytes> which it seems to be from the example
[00:54:14] <nesoi> cool, thanks a lot! I am as is obvious a novice with this stuff
[00:54:17] <beachandbytes> which is just an object way of defining what we did above
[00:54:41] <beachandbytes> me too no worries
[00:54:53] <nesoi> you seem to know javascript at least though
[00:55:04] <beachandbytes> im just better at interpreting stackoverflow
[00:55:12] <nesoi> ah... good skill
[00:55:18] <beachandbytes> definitly
[00:56:12] <beachandbytes> let me know if you need anything else always glad to help
[00:56:19] <nesoi> thanks so much!
[01:02:01] <nesoi> beachandbytes : how about the other properties under 'Cancel' in the code I pasted?
[01:02:37] <nesoi> and what about the "tap:" in the example?
[01:03:42] <fat> Can someone please make tihs work on jquery 1.9.1 http://jsfiddle.net/5KLeA/
[01:05:10] <beachandbytes> nesoi you can define that in your function
[01:05:48] <nesoi> beachandbytes : like this?
[01:06:26] <nesoi> dialog_buttons['Cancel'].tap = function (){console.log('cancel');} dialog_buttons['Cancel'].icon = 'delete'; dialog_buttons['Cancel'].theme = 'c';
[01:06:39] <beachandbytes> thats what i would try
[01:06:50] <beachandbytes> now that i look at it, it would probably be the required function
[01:07:45] <nesoi> what do you mean?
[01:08:53] <iksik> hmmm, what am i doing wrong here http://plnkr.co/edit/LsYhYj?p=preview ? after second drop, cells with is screwed ;-/
[01:09:29] <nesoi> beachandbytes : hmm... not working ERROR:Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'tap' of undefined, file:///android_asset/www/js/rl.js:439 at file:///android_asset/www/js/rl.js:1
[01:10:14] <nesoi> beachandbytes : that line says
[01:10:20] <nesoi> dialog_buttons[currentContact.phoneNumbers[m]].tap = function() {
[01:10:22] <beachandbytes> you need to set dialog_buttons['Cancel] = {}
[01:10:34] <beachandbytes> then dialog_buttons['Cancel'].tap = function...
[01:10:41] <nesoi> ah
[01:11:24] <didiergm> fat it works if you add the migrate 1.1.0 plugin, there you get some error messages in the console
[01:12:58] <nesoi> hmm.. beachandbytes it shows object.object as the label
[01:13:32] <nesoi> but at least it shows the buttons...
[01:13:44] <beachandbytes> humm
[01:14:51] <beachandbytes> try dialog_buttons['Cancel']['tap'] = {}
[01:14:53] <beachandbytes> then function
[01:15:13] <beachandbytes> now im just guessing :)
[01:15:33] <nesoi> first dialog_buttons['Cancel'] = {}; and then dialog_buttons['Cancel']['tap'] = {}; you think?
[01:15:37] <beachandbytes> can you put up a simple example on jsfiddle
[01:15:50] <nesoi> hm. maybe
[01:16:04] <didiergm> fat there is a conversation re browser deprecated @ stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9638247/is-jquery-browser-deprecated
[01:16:12] <beachandbytes> im too lazy to do it myself but if you put it up im interested enough to play with it :)
[01:16:43] <nesoi> will jsfiddle let me include a js library?
[01:17:06] <beachandbytes> ya
[01:17:08] <beachandbytes> references tab
[01:17:17] <beachandbytes> on left side just link to it
[01:17:39] <discorpia> nesoi: "Add Resources" in the left side menu
[01:17:59] <beachandbytes> or that :)
[01:18:39] <fat> didiergm: ok i just finished reading that, i find it useless. i still dont' know how to get this to work in 1.9.1
[01:18:40] <fat> http://jsfiddle.net/5KLeA/2/
[01:21:25] <nesoi> hum... I haven't done that b4
[01:22:03] <didiergm> fat I unfiortunately don't have the time to delve into the dropkick plugin atm - sorry I am about to launch a new app - but on their page @ github there is a link to talk to the original author; may be worth a shot.  page is at https://github.com/JamieLottering/DropKick
[01:22:24] <nesoi> in jsfiddle do I have to define all the events, etc?
[01:23:36] <beachandbytes> just the ones needed for this popup
[01:23:41] <beachandbytes> just create a div to click on
[01:23:48] <beachandbytes> and the popup event trigged by div
[01:24:32] <didiergm> as a quick fix you could either add the compatibility plugin or fix the use of $.browser in the plugin; a quick look show it is only used in one place. should not be too complex to fix
[01:25:58] <didiergm> fat : sorry forgot to add your name
[01:28:05] <faraway> fat: do oyu need to go with dropkit, or would http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/index.html be an alternative?
[01:28:51] <nesoi> beachandbytes : actually it worked! the thing I was using was itself an object so I had to read it off into another variable
[01:28:54] <nesoi> yay!
[01:28:57] <nesoi> thanks again
[01:29:05] <beachandbytes> np glad it worked
[01:29:37] <nesoi> I didn't know you could do that, and I was thinking of cludgy ways to handle cases where there were different #s of phone #s
[01:32:21] <didiergm> jqm 1.3.0 do you know what is the preferred jquery version I am starting to upgrade
[01:32:36] <nesoi> jqm 1.3 is brand new
[01:32:55] <nesoi> supposedly it works with 1.9.1 jq, but I haven't tested it
[01:33:17] <nesoi> that is, I tried it and it didn't work for me at all
[01:33:23] <nesoi> but I'm using some deprecated stuff
[01:34:11] <didiergm> nesoi I am asking because the cdn links refer to 1.8.2; Ok I guess I'll give it a shot
[01:34:51] <SP33D> hi littel syntax question <script language="JavaScript"><document.write("<form name=formname method=post action=\"mailto:recipient@example.com?body=" + encodeURIComponent("Anzahl 1 Cent Packete") + "\">mail me!</a>")</script>
[01:35:01] <nesoi> yeah, try 1.9.1 and if not go back to 1.8.2
[01:35:11] <SP33D> in this example when i wanna use a javascript var in the encodeURIComponent value
[01:35:16] <SP33D> how do i need to do that
[01:35:17] <beachandbytes> its usually pretty easy to debug whats breaking it
[01:35:28] <beachandbytes> possibly .live
[01:35:48] <nesoi> how would you debut it? I'm using delegate
[01:36:13] <nesoi> debug
[01:36:16] <beachandbytes> what errors are you getting?:
[01:36:21] <beachandbytes> if any
[01:36:55] <nesoi> I didn't check. I just substituted 1.3.0 and 1.9.1 for 1.2.0 and 1.8.2 and things didn't work so I gave up  :)
[01:37:26] <beachandbytes> well definitly check errors first
[01:37:31] <beachandbytes> might be something simple
[01:42:12] <didiergm> nesoi, beachandbyte will do and report here what issues I had it may help someone  migrating
[01:47:40] <nesoi> cool didiergm
[01:49:16] <wavez> I'm working with .sortable(). It's setting an inline style on my elements after dropping them, and it's messing up my CSS.
[01:49:36] <wavez> It's adding style="display: block"
[01:51:07] <wavez> hmm. Must have been a result of using helper: clone
[01:57:32] <SP33D> waves
[01:57:43] <SP33D> you can overwrite the inline code with css in the css file
[01:57:43] <James13433>  Can somebody please help me withhow to do this in javascript, I have written what I need in php. http://pastebin.com/Zg6F1DzG
[01:57:53] <SP33D> simply google a bit about overwriting inline css
[01:58:56] <didiergm> nesoi: initial impression : positive, feels faster. in my case the migrate plugin is useless as I started the app 6 weeks ago and was careful to avoid deprecated features.
[02:00:16] <esas> James: What is the array containing?
[02:00:19] <didiergm> on JQM itself a few css issues (e.g. data entry fields not same size as before, canvas has a background, some fields which where hidden are visible, but I need to delve into that one a bit more.) so it won't be a drop in replacement
[02:00:21] <esas> no native foreach
[02:00:50] <James13433> esas, input values and names.
[02:00:52] <didiergm> but does not seem too much - will continue testing with the frontend/back end (php) interactions
[02:01:31] <esas> ohic , hold on
[02:02:42] <esas> crap, infection, brb
[02:06:41] <stabb> would this work? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/uskyp
[02:12:17] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have problems with putting a tab() on a dialog... The tabs are there but when i click them, the div for the tab is not shown. Did anyone experienced the same?
[02:13:07] <stabb> open: function() { $('#tabs').tabs(); }
[02:14:22] <Krambiorix> stabb, that's what i have
[02:14:54] <stabb> markup error
[02:15:08] <Krambiorix> stabb, the html content validates
[02:15:29] <stabb> not invalid, but the mark is incorrect
[02:15:39] <stabb> markup
[02:16:43] <Krambiorix> stabb, how do you mean?
[02:17:38] <stabb> if you copy paste from the sample markup does it work?
[02:19:56] <JonnyT> I have a number of different colour styles for a website in which i want to randomize on each page load/request by changing the body id value... code soo far  https://gist.github.com/turkingj/e0ee781800c76791148f
[02:20:13] <stabb> you can post to jsfiddle.net what you have so everyone can have a look
[02:21:19] <JonnyT> ahh ok
[02:21:38] <stabb> that was for Krambiorix, JonnyT
[02:22:22] <stabb> you can use Math.floor() and Math.random() JonnyT
[02:27:18] <JonnyT> Thanks stabb, new to jquery/javascript do i need to use the $(document).ready() function to stop the default colours from displaying and then changing to the new colours?? and how to use Math.floor and random ? https://gist.github.com/turkingj/e0ee781800c76791148f
[02:32:53] <stabb> bgcol = colours[Math.floor(Math.random()*colours.length)];
[02:33:23] <limpc> im looking for a thumbnail "stack" plugin that will sort of expand the stack slightly so you can see more of the thumbnails on mouseover. any suggestions? I've been googling but not finding anything useful
[02:33:42] <stabb> so now bgcol is yellow or whatever
[02:34:53] <stabb> then in your ready(), $(body).css('background-color', bgcolour);
[02:37:13] <stabb> and in one hit $(body).css({'background-color': colours[Math.floor(Math.random()*colours.length)]});
[02:37:56] <JonnyT> Thanks stabb, i have multiple styles so needing it to change the body id value
[02:38:29] <JonnyT> so <body id="red"> etc..
[02:39:27] <stabb> attr('id', bgcolour);
[02:45:59] <Krambiorix> stabb, i'm checking that out now
[02:48:37] <dude> http://pastebin.com/DL5KQMRS
[02:48:42] <dude> hey dudes why timeouts won't work?
[02:48:49] <dude> it's alaways undefined in console
[02:49:17] <Guest88160> #javascript
[02:49:27] <stabb> var timeouts = [];
[02:49:59] <Guest88160> ?
[02:50:02] <Guest88160> it's ok
[02:50:14] <Guest88160> but it doesn't sets them in ajax request success
[02:50:22] <Guest88160> cause if i log them they are undefined
[02:50:26] <Krambiorix> stabb, when i run the code from the dialog (without the dialog) it works
[02:50:31] <limpc> http://tympanus.net/Development/Baraja/ thats what i was looking for
[02:50:33] <stabb> put it in popComments?
[02:50:43] <Guest88160> stabb: already in
[02:50:51] <Guest88160> check beforeSend and success:
[02:50:59] <Guest88160> 1 clear  1 set , timeouts
[02:51:03] <Guest88160> but it doesn't works
[02:51:21] <Guest88160> all is ok, request return json everything ok, but it doesn't set and clean timeouts
[02:51:58] <Guest88160> unbeliavable
[02:52:11] <Krambiorix> stabb, sorry it doesn't
[02:52:33] <stabb> Krambiorix: post to jsfiddle.net
[02:54:23] <stabb> var thing; function hello() { alert(window.thing);} ?
[02:54:38] <stabb> old sk00l
[02:55:01] <Krambiorix> stabb, http://jsfiddle.net/7vbLe/
[02:55:25] <Guest88160> stabb: any help?
[02:57:21] <shcked> anyone know what the effect for slowly sliding a floated div into the place of another div that has been faded out would be call?
[02:58:02] <nesoi> hmm... so now I can see these popups, and they seem to work, but if I tap a button on the popup, the element under the popup also gets a tap. How do I stop that from happening?
[02:59:08] <stabb> http://jsfiddle.net/RcUHz/1/
[03:01:06] <stabb> Krambiorix: might want to clean up that jsfiddle so it only shows clean html, js + select jqueryUI from the library
[03:01:34] <stabb> put the css in the css area, the html in the..  you get the idea
[03:02:17] <stabb> Krambiorix: here is a head start http://jsfiddle.net/dreadwarrior/3d7QC/12/
[03:05:24] <Krambiorix> stabb, thanks!
[03:07:48] <nesoi> stabb : would you have any hint as to preventing underlying elements from receiving a tap event when a dialog box floating on top of them is tapped?
[03:08:33] <nesoi> or anyone else?
[03:08:46] <stabb> your using jquery UI on a touch device?
[03:08:52] <nesoi> jqm
[03:09:11] <stabb> Ok - I don't know :)
[03:09:22] <milestone> hi all i am trying to write an automated load test against a jquery ui. can anyone tell me which is the best tool for that?
[03:09:40] <nesoi> what if it were a click on a non-touch device?
[03:10:54] <nesoi> I know how to kludge it but...
[03:11:00] <stabb> unbind events under a certain z-index maybe? idk
[03:11:01] <shcked> http://jsfiddle.net/shcked/8Fjkg/ not fading out..
[03:11:25] <stabb> or where object is not dialog
[03:15:47] <Hermiene> What's the preferred click event handler? I've seen click(), live(), and on()
[03:16:03] <Cork> Hermiene: .live is deprecated
[03:16:15] <Cork> on and bind is basically the same thing
[03:16:20] <Cork> and .click is a shorthand for that
[03:16:54] <Cork> .click(function() {}) === .bind('click', function() {}) === .on('click', function() {})
[03:18:11] <nesoi> stabb: that's interesting. how do you unbind events by z-index?
[03:19:09] <stabb> idk but it sounds like a bad idea :P
[03:19:25] <seba4> hi there ... how could i solve this code..... https://gist.github.com/seba4/5012765
[03:19:33] <seba4> i have a problem it works fine on click
[03:19:50] <seba4> but when it is open once.. and i press esc  then the code gets wronge
[03:19:51] <seba4> wrong
[03:20:13] <seba4> this code $(".securekey_toggle").toggle("drop") ... just misses when is showed and when is hidden ..
[03:32:12] <stabb> lol http://learn.jquery.com/performance/dont-act-on-absent-elements/
[03:33:27] <Hermiene> Cork: Alright, thanks.
[03:33:42] <nesoi> I thought I could kludge it by setting a global flag when we're in the middle of doing a popup and ignoring tap events to the underlying listview if the flag is set, but that isn't working either.
[03:33:46] <nesoi> any ideas of what to try?
[03:34:28] <shcked> stabb: would you know how to get my blue div to smoothly slide into the place of my red div? http://jsfiddle.net/shcked/8Fjkg/
[03:36:01] <shcked> I tried using Quicksand to do this (razorjack.net/quicksand) but the plugin isn't easy to work with =\
[03:36:35] <bluescreenX> good morning! someone here who knows about the jquery mobile nested listviews?
[03:36:55] <bluescreenX> the documentation says its deprecated
[03:37:37] <bluescreenX> how can i implement a navigation tree without it? do i need to create all the subpages?
[03:37:37] <Anuruddha> hi all
[03:37:59] <Anuruddha> I have an issue with jquery mobile nav bar
[03:38:44] <Anuruddha> when clicked on  new tab nav bar also undergoes the page transition
[03:38:49] <chilversc_> can't really agree with all those performance tips, such as the Celver Conditionals one
[03:38:57] <chilversc_> *Clever
[03:39:21] <Anuruddha> how can I avoid the transition of navbar?
[03:39:44] <chilversc_> that just seem to be too clever and obfusicates the code a bit, the type == ... || type == ... is simpler to read
[03:40:13] <bluescreenX> you have to set it to fixed persistent mode
[03:41:37] <bluescreenX> Anuruddha, set it to data-position="fixed" and data-tap-toggle="false" to remove the hiding behavior
[03:42:04] <bluescreenX> and for the items you have to use the cative class "ui-btn-active ui-state-persist"
[03:42:11] <bluescreenX> *active
[03:42:21] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX:
[03:42:39] <bluescreenX> this worked for me
[03:42:49] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: i did the same as you said.but it didn't work on my android device
[03:43:59] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: here is my code http://jsbin.com/izoroj/3/
[03:44:34] <Anuruddha> it works nice there.But on mobile navbar also undergoes the transition
[03:47:05] <bluescreenX> i guess the position:fixed is not working on your device
[03:47:46] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: do you know any fix?.i've spent many hours on this issue
[03:48:03] <Murph`> does anyone know if there is an actual download-version of the jquery-api?
[03:48:31] <bluescreenX> http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/fixed-position/
[03:49:32] <chilversc_> Murph`: is this what you're after? https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[03:49:36] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: many thanks for the help.I'll look in to that :)
[03:49:41] <c00kiemon5ter> hey all
[03:50:08] <chilversc_> Murph`: thought that isn't strictly offline documentation
[03:50:38] <c00kiemon5ter> say, I'm looking at example.com from my browser, with an open console. example.com does not load jquery so I cannot do stuff like $('li') .. etc
[03:50:56] <c00kiemon5ter> is there a way to load jquery there and have that functionality in the console ?
[03:50:58] <bluescreenX> Anuruddha, do you maybe have an idea how to get a back button into a nested listview :D
[03:51:44] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: sorry,i didn't get you.
[03:53:16] <Murph`> chilversc_ unfortunately not :( i'm using jQuery in my Bachelor-Thesis and my professor wants all related stuff on CD, jQuery itself is no problem, but the complete documentation is :/
[03:54:19] <bluescreenX> just provide a link to the docs on your cd ;)
[03:54:33] <chilversc_> Murph`: well, technically the complete documentation is there, so long as you're willing to read XML :)
[03:54:41] <bluescreenX> the prof should have internet
[03:55:05] <chilversc_> bluescreenX: probably needs to be stand-alone so it can be archived, the site can always change or be removed
[03:55:36] <Murph`> chilversc_ your right, it's about for future use, when the ucrrent version may be outdated and not anymore available
[03:55:49] <bluescreenX> ah ok
[03:56:18] <stabb> shcked: here is one idea http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[03:56:31] <Murph`> it will be archived for 10 years i think, that may be a little long for websites to remain unchanged;)
[03:56:52] <bluescreenX> can someone tell me an alternative to using nested listviews in jqm?
[03:57:36] <stabb> shcked: You are most likely going to adjust z-index and move either side
[04:00:36] <treeprogram> Is it possible with jQuery to redirect the user to a new page, and transfer a variables stored client side to the user's new client-side code?
[04:01:47] <Anuruddha> bluescreenX: I've jsut changed the jqm version and it worked :)
[04:01:58] <bluescreenX> :D
[04:02:05] <chilversc_> Murph`: but the build scripts for the documentation, etc are in that repository, along with the instructions, so you might be able to build some static offline docs from that with a bit of work
[04:02:19] <bluescreenX> yes the 1.30 was realeased last days
[04:02:20] <chilversc_> Murph`: though any ajax demos wouldn't work, since ajax can't run off the local hard drive
[04:02:39] <treeprogram> So, firstpage.html has a 'var1' with a value stored in it, the page redirects to secondpage.html, with 'var1' and its value in the HTML, all without 'var1' being sent to the server?
[04:02:59] <Murph`> i think its more about the describtion of functions than the actual demos
[04:03:11] <emaxxim> hi, everybody
[04:03:37] <bluescreenX> treeprogram, just put your varaibles global, or use cookies, localStorage or web sql database
[04:03:49] <chilversc_> Murph`: you can also get the jquery source from http://github.com/jquery/jquery the advantage over the single flat file is it's much more readable
[04:03:49] <bluescreenX> there are many possibilities
[04:04:29] <treeprogram> bluescreenX thanks
[04:04:45] <chilversc_> treeprogram: there's also sessionStorage for something like that (localStorage but specific to the browser session)
[04:05:06] <bluescreenX> yes i forgot that one ;)
[04:05:17] <chilversc_> bluescreenX: cookies technically still send to the server
[04:05:21] <emaxxim> how i can show one div when click the direct element from one list or a sequence of a div, I don't want to write the code for all of the showing objetc
[04:05:42] <emaxxim> *object
[04:05:48] <treeprogram> ok I'll check that out chiversc_ thanks
[04:05:54] <bluescreenX> but is sessionStorage available on all devices/browsers?
[04:06:41] <Dirkos> Is there a way to register a dblclick on a select? i noticed it wont work in firefox but i actually need it
[04:06:58] <chilversc_> bluescreenX: dunno, but the same can be asked about localstorage, websql or webdb
[04:07:07] <ohcibi> is a normal div not able to receive a keydown event?
[04:07:31] <ohcibi> actually i mean a <li> 8-)...
[04:07:38] <bluescreenX> ohcibi, if there is no focus yes
[04:07:48] <chilversc_> bluescreenX: as with anything, just have to test on all the browsers you support, and allow for degredation if you can or if it matters
[04:07:53] <bluescreenX> you have to focus it first to receive ke events
[04:08:03] <ohcibi> bluescreenX: it is focussed.. now keyevent thrown
[04:08:30] <ohcibi> bluescreenX: oh sorry, it is... but not on the smart tv emulator and the remote control buttons...
[04:08:38] <chilversc_> bluescreenX: I'd find it odd if a browser supported localStorage but not sessionStorage (they're the same interface, sessionStorage is just deleted at the end of the browser session)
[04:09:09] <bluescreenX> yeah you' right
[04:09:11] <ohcibi> bluescreenX: hm nope... i had a listener on document, but when I change it back to the focussed element no handler is thrown..
[04:09:13] <ohcibi> i'll fiddle
[04:09:50] <bluescreenX> ah it seems i have to hack the core to get the backbutton on the sub pages of the nested list ...
[04:09:58] <Murph`> chilversc_ thanks i'll have a look at the github and if i got the time at the end, i'll have a look into parsing the xmls
[04:14:34] <emaxxim> someone can help me?
[04:15:23] <bluescreenX> ask
[04:15:46] <emaxxim> how i can show one div when click the direct element from one list or a sequence of a div, I don't want to write the code for all of the showing object
[04:17:25] <Kambfhase> Whats the point of calling .on() without a handler?
[04:18:08] <emaxxim> hold on a sec i'll post some code
[04:19:28] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: there isn't, the handler is a required paramter
[04:19:59] <Kambfhase> chilversc: thats what i thought: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:20:03] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: that or the events parameter has to be an object, where key names match the event name, and the values are a handler
[04:20:31] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: eg, $(...).on({click: clickHandler, change: changeHandler})
[04:20:45] <Kambfhase> Ah, yeah. But. on("click") ist bullshit, right?
[04:20:51] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: yeah
[04:20:55] <Kambfhase> kk
[04:21:56] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: dunno if it gets counted as if you'd wrote, .on("click", false) which cancels the event
[04:22:56] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: but if so I'd say that's still an error in the code, since .on("click", false) is explicit in what is supposed to be happening, whilst .on("click") just looks wrong
[04:24:11] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: nope, just checked the source, and it uses if (fn === false)
[04:25:38] <chilversc_> also on a side note looking at the source, overloaded functions in javascript are just messy, especially when it's the middle parameters that are optional
[04:26:47] <Kambfhase> You know, what woudl be cool: .on("click", {".class1":foo, "class2": bar})
[04:27:24] <emaxxim> here is what i need http://jsbin.com/amovuj/1/
[04:28:09] <emaxxim> when i click on el1 id i want to show desc1, and so on
[04:28:30] <emaxxim> but i don't want to write four different function
[04:28:39] <Kambfhase> emattias: you cannot have multiple elements with the same ID
[04:30:26] <chilversc_> emaxxim: you could make them hyperlinks and use anchor tags, then hook in to the window.hashchange event
[04:31:00] <chilversc_> emaxxim: so then you'd just have; <a href="#description1">Foo</a><div id="description1">...</div>
[04:32:01] <chilversc_> emaxxim: if you can't use hashs for whatever reason, then another way is to add something like data-target, eg, <div data-target="description1">Primo</div> and use .attr('data-target')
[04:32:18] <chilversc_> emaxxim: but I like that one less, because it doesn't play as nicely with nagivation, history and copying the URL
[04:32:35] <Kambfhase> thats overpowered.
[04:32:40] <emaxxim> thank chilversc_
[04:32:53] <emaxxim> but i don't get it
[04:33:04] <chilversc_> emaxxim: also, it doesn't make the menu items hyperlinks, so you should really wrap them in <button data-target="description1" type="button">Primo</button> so that they support keyboard navigation
[04:33:13] <emaxxim> and I want some animations that's why i use jquery
[04:33:21] <chilversc_> emaxxim: but all that is getting to be a lot more work than using a hyperlink and a url hash
[04:34:05] <emaxxim> I know but it's all on the same page
[04:34:25] <emaxxim> It's a mega box in one page
[04:34:45] <chilversc_> emaxxim: that's exactly why you use the url hash + window.hashchange, it doesn't navigate to a different page
[04:34:51] <Kambfhase> http://jsbin.com/amovuj/2
[04:35:34] <Kambfhase> emaxxim: http://jsbin.com/amovuj/2 << that totally works without hash change
[04:35:42] <chilversc_> emaxxim: if you want animations between pages, and want to support graceful degredation for older browsers, and want to split the content on to multiple pages, you can instead use the new pushstate method
[04:35:43] <emaxxim> yeah this Kambfhase
[04:36:39] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: I don't like that so much, I find it more fragile (since it requires the order to match between the 2 items)
[04:36:51] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: so now, if you re-arrange the menu but not the items things break
[04:37:03] <emaxxim> Kambfhase thanks this is what I need, and maybe i can apply this script to a hover?
[04:37:10] <Kambfhase> yes
[04:37:20] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: hence why I'd prefer the data-target over that, since it's more explicit
[04:37:29] <Kambfhase> but thats a bit more work.
[04:38:57] <Kambfhase> chilversc: well, obviously emaxx couldn't even figure out this simple version himself. So you must not point him to advanced shit like pushState
[04:39:28] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: not really, I find it less work, $("#menu").on("click", "div", function() { var target = $(this).attr("data-target"); $("#description).children().hide(); if (target) $(target).show(); });
[04:40:02] <emaxxim> Kambfhase: can i add some default text before the first click?
[04:40:05] <Kambfhase> why not use .data("target")
[04:41:20] <Kambfhase> emaxxim: you could a fifth div, that gets hidden, once a "link" gets clicked. YEah.
[04:42:26] <btipling> heh
[04:42:35] <btipling> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/variable-definition/
[04:42:38] <btipling> that page is rubbish
[04:42:45] <btipling> http://jsperf.com/variable-definition
[04:43:00] <btipling> same in chrome, and the suggestion is *slower* in Firefox
[04:43:11] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: because I know I want the data attribute, why go through all the extra complexity that the data method adds?
[04:43:21] <Kambfhase> yeah, ist not a self-executing function. its an IIFE
[04:44:19] <Kambfhase> chilversc: if you want the element with the id "menu" ,why go through all the extra complexity that jQuery adds?
[04:44:43] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: because it handles a few cross-browser compatibily issues
[04:47:16] <sukima> OMG I don't know what happened but this might be a bug in jQuery latest: https://gist.github.com/sukima/5013173 <- causes an infinate loop! Did I do something wrong?!
[04:47:33] <chilversc_> Kambfhase: also, I see where $.fn.data caches the data- attributes, but I don't see where it updates that cache if the attribute's value changes
[04:47:56] <chilversc_> so if you do use $.fn.data to read the data- attributes, you must also use it to update them
[04:48:46] <Kambfhase> you have a function in a function with the same name as the function?
[04:49:51] <Kambfhase> you shoudl put a new on line 11
[04:50:57] <sukima> Kambfhase: That's a pattern I stole from CoffeeScript. It is done to step around some weird IE bugs
[04:53:15] <Kambfhase> Line 6 ist weird. Why to you try to trigger an event on a function?
[04:54:15] <sukima> Kambfhase: I wanted to use jQuery events on my object.
[04:54:19] <sukima> coffeescript: http://coffeescript.org/#try:class%20Test%0A%20%20constructor%3A%20-%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%24(Test).trigger%20%22init.test%22%0A%20%20ready%3A%20-%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%24(%40).trigger%20%22ready.test%22%0A%0A%24(Test).on%20%22init%22%2C%20-%3E%20console.log%20%22Test%20init'ed%22%0A%0AmyTest%20%3D%20new%20Test()%0A%0A%24(myTest).on%20%22ready%22%2C%20-%3E%20console.log%20%22Test%20ready'ed%22%0A%0AmyTest.ready()
[04:55:23] <sukima> Got the idea from this blog post: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1520-Binding-Events-To-Non-DOM-Objects-With-jQuery.htm
[04:55:54] <Kambfhase> sukima: a) you missed the most important part! ()
[04:56:25] <sukima> LOL so I did!
[04:56:42] <Kambfhase> b) I stil think that should be $(@).trigger "init.test"
[04:59:46] <sukima> I thought about that but was like how can I attach an event with on to an object that hasn;t been created yet. So that's why I trigger on the static version. Either way this still causes the browser to go into an infinate loop and crash
[05:02:31] <sm_> Hello, I'm currently using jQ UI draggable and droppable a list of elements but I also want to fire a click event only if the element has not been dragged. Is there any way to test for this and fire click event only if the element has not been moved?
[05:04:00] <sukima> Fixed the gist
[05:05:23] <Kambfhase> hah, got it.
[05:05:24] <hemanth> what's wrong with? $('div.langs:contains("python")'); ?
[05:07:05] <Kambfhase> sukima: when you pass a function into $(fn) thats a shortcut for document.ready. Since the document is ready, that gets immideately fired. so fn gets executed. In this cas thats the inner Test. Which then passes itself into $(fn), ...
[05:07:33] <sukima> OMG! Kambfhase Your right! Thank you!
[05:08:28] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:08:44] <sukima> You rick sir!
[05:08:48] <sukima> *rock
[05:09:40] <Kambfhase> :D
[05:10:00] <hemanth> $('*[python]').css("border","solid 2px red"); hmm does not work...missing something?
[05:10:26] <hemanth> I'm just collecting lines that contains any given term
[05:12:51] <Kambfhase> hemanth: please paste your code
[05:13:08] <hemanth> Kambfhase, $('div:contains("python")')
[05:13:39] <Kambfhase> It's case sensitive.
[05:14:14] <hemanth> can't use RE here?
[05:15:08] <Kambfhase> you can use $('div').filter(function(){ return /python/i.test(this); })
[05:16:32] <hemanth> Kambfhase, that is returning [] even though there are many occurrences
[05:16:50] <Kambfhase> you can use $('div').filter(function(){ return /python/i.test($(this).text()); })
[05:16:52] <Kambfhase> my bad
[05:19:09] <tallio> hello guys
[05:20:28] <tallio> could someone help me to understand how to animate a little thing ? I d want make an animation on text that disappear then re appear. i d like to understand the 'How to'
[05:21:06] <tallio> not to make the code, only to understand how i will have to do
[05:22:57] <soee> tallio, just hide it/show it
[05:23:04] <Teduardo> does anyone know of a decent frame work that can help make a form that builds itself based on responses to ajax queries? for example the form is blank until the user selects an option, and then it does an ajaxcall and builds the form based on what comes back from the ajax call?
[05:23:12] <soee> for example using some effect like fade
[05:24:49] <tallio> soee > it s just more complicate : i get texts infos from sql db, then via php i made divs for every text. simple :) then i would make a function in jquery that show the first div (as they are all display none) then hide it in a duration of 5000 per example then make the second appear and repeat it for all the divs
[05:25:13] <tallio> *complicated
[05:25:47] <dersand> Could someone please explain to me what "function parameters" or "function arguments" is what they do?
[05:26:03] <dersand> is and what they do*
[05:26:07] <eroll> hi, i'm using jquery autocomplete with a remote call to a solr core. Everything seems correct and works excepts my ajax call ( after having complete open function of autocomplete ) which raise a parserror ... anyone knows why or how this happens ?
[05:26:33] <soee> tallio, no not so complicated, just use each() on those divs and go to next index, until last is reached, than go back to first
[05:27:40] <ohcibi> does anyone know a cool trick to do this: https://gist.github.com/ohcibi/5013367 in one line/more elegant?
[05:27:42] <tallio> soee > ok i think i understand. but do you know a tuto or somethin to understand how to get first index, all index and last index ?
[05:30:28] <hemanth> Kambfhase, that worked, but not $('div').filter(function(){ $('div#test').html(/python/i.test($(this).text())); }) ; why not?
[05:31:01] <Kambfhase> return
[05:31:38] <Kambfhase> WTF is that code supposed to do anyways?
[05:34:03] <hemanth> Kambfhase, heh heh, need to filter out the containing term and hide all other either than those that matched
[05:35:13] <Kambfhase> $('div').filter(function(){ return !/python/i.test( $(this).text()); ).hide();
[05:36:40] <Kambfhase> dersand: http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter3.html
[05:37:49] <hemanth> Kambfhase, yikes it hide everything...
[05:38:48] <hemanth> Kambfhase, my bad, that was uber kool!
[05:39:03] <Kambfhase> you men Übercool?
[05:39:23] <Kambfhase> or Übercööl?
[05:42:15] <hemanth> heh heh Kambfhase instead of div, if i need to search the whole body? $('body').filter....did not produce the same
[05:42:54] <dersand> how is function(variable) diffrent from function(){var variable }?
[05:42:56] <Kambfhase> thats not how you do it.
[05:43:49] <Kambfhase> $(".seletor > to.elements > that +shall.be #hidden").filter() ...
[05:44:13] <Kambfhase> dersand: well, you know you can call a function, right?
[05:44:23] <hemanth> for search the whole page?
[05:44:45] <dersand> you mean function name()?
[05:44:45] <Kambfhase> you dont want to hide the whole page, or do you?
[05:44:57] <Kambfhase> dersand: yes.
[05:45:43] <Kambfhase> you can also do name( 12, "string", argument).
[05:46:21] <Kambfhase> In that cas you tell the function, "Hey do what i coded you for, using these values as input"
[05:46:45] <Teduardo> Is it lame to hide/unhide <div> based on the value of a select?
[05:47:55] <carpii> not overly, depends what youre trying to do
[05:51:24] <Teduardo> carpii: I'm trying to make a dynamic form to open a support ticket; basiclaly the page loads and has a <select>; when they pick an option I want it to hit a php script which will return a list of the users objects for the category they select (in json) then display the proper form.
[05:51:40] <Teduardo> im just trying to do it in the least lame way possible
[05:52:18] <carpii> Ted, that would kinda work but id consider having a Next button or something
[05:52:32] <carpii> because if they mousewheel down the select, it may end up firing lots of ajax you werent intending
[05:52:51] <carpii> which of course you could avoid with a bit of coding, but a next button would make more sense
[05:53:02] <seba4> for what for is return function?
[05:53:22] <carpii> or present them as labels, and handle the click event on those
[05:53:24] <Teduardo> ahh next buttons are web 1.0 =D and I can do that whole thing with just PHP and no client side, so that seems fine =)
[05:53:33] <Teduardo> i'll do it that way
[05:53:43] <carpii> the other issue is in some browsers selects dont always fire events when using the keyboard arrows
[05:54:18] <hemanth> Kambfhase, if no occurrences i don't mind hiding the whole page, but for the next search term i need to unhide them all ...hmm
[05:54:30] <carpii> i wouldnt worry if its web 1.0 or web 2.0. People just want usability :p
[05:54:32] <Teduardo> next+click = submit anyway
[05:55:05] <Kambfhase> $('div').show().filter(function(){ return !/python/i.test( $(this).text()); ).hide();
[05:55:41] <Teduardo> you should see some of my server side shenanigans
[06:03:56] <lolhii> Can this be done in one line? http://paste.laravel.com/irI
[06:05:58] <Kambfhase> jQuery(form).append(paypal_digital,payerid,token)
[06:06:35] <Kambfhase> jQuery(form).append(paypal_digital,[payerid,token])
[06:07:05] <Kambfhase> doesnt matter.
[06:07:36] <Petazz> I'm trying to use the wymeditor, through file jquery.wymeditor.js but I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'browser' of undefined jquery.wymeditor.js:6424
[06:08:00] <Petazz> What could cause that jquery isn't loaded beforehand?
[06:09:11] <shoky> Petazz: that plugin is using $.browser which was removed in jquery 1.9
[06:09:33] <shoky> oh hm of undefined, maybe a diff problem
[06:09:43] <Petazz> shoky: But the jQuery I'm using is 1.4.2 =/
[06:10:09] <Petazz> I'm using actually Django-CMS and it works fine built in but with a new plugin it fails for some reason
[06:10:25] <Petazz> And in the console it says $ not defined
[06:10:43] <shoky> Petazz: ok.. i don't really know without seeing it for myself..
[06:12:01] <Petazz> shoky: Ok, but how could I debug if jquery is ready before this runs or..?
[06:13:41] <Petazz> I mean like, how can jQuery be defined, but $ is not?
[06:13:59] <Kambfhase> jQuery.noConflict()
[06:14:08] <shoky> Petazz: oh jQuery is defined?  then maybe you or your CMS called .noConflict()
[06:15:35] <Petazz> shoky: I'll have to do some searching. This should work as is but I'll check. Thx
[06:16:47] <CodeFriar> Hex encoded string to binary. Anyone know how?
[06:17:04] <hemanth> Kambfhase, $('div').show().filter(function(){ return !/python/i.test( $(this).text()); ).hide(); is only div, but it can be in any element
[06:17:06] <bluescreenX> how can i add pages on jquery mobile on the fly? i appended the html into the dom but how can i update this tomake it look like jqm page?
[06:17:10] <shoky> Petazz: looks like you're not the only one to hit that problem:  https://github.com/wymeditor/wymeditor/commit/7f6dca733b7eae730c193a8157d9d8df40f4bcdd
[06:17:10] <b-ot> shoky: winhamwr (7mon 3w ago): Refs #359. Replaced $. with jQuery.
[06:17:21] <tallio> guys, could someone help me on a little and simple animation ? i made a pastie.
[06:17:49] <tallio> dunno if i can publish pastie here ?
[06:18:02] <shoky> tallio: you can
[06:18:07] <Kambfhase> hemanth: you _could_ do $('*').show().filter(function(){ return !/python/i.test( $(this).text()); ).hide();
[06:18:16] <Kambfhase> but that is nasty
[06:18:52] <tallio> shoky thanks > http://pastie.org/6316679
[06:19:04] <bluescreenX> $.mobile.initializePage(); does not work :(
[06:19:58] <tallio> the goal is not to make my code, i would understand ow it works if possible
[06:20:05] <hemanth> Kambfhase, nastiness is the only way out here ;)
[06:20:06] <tallio> how*
[06:20:07] <Drager> So I'm making a content slider; http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/ I'm currently stuck trying to create a prev button so the previous image will be showed. And if I spam the "Next" it will bug. Any ideas?
[06:23:08] <hemanth> Kambfhase, understood why that is nasty now! It's show all hidden elements that will spoil the page :\ doing such a search feature is a pain in the neck
[06:25:27] <tallio> nobody to help me on my problem ? http://pastie.org/6316679
[06:26:55] <Kambfhase> tallio: why not pick one of the over 9000 carousle plugins out there?
[06:27:57] <tallio> Kambfhase : because i prefer learn how to instead of copy what have been done ?
[06:28:16] <Kambfhase> ah, kk.
[06:28:43] <shoky> tallio: http://jsfiddle.net/VNfzf/
[06:29:33] <tallio> uh shoky you did all... how will i understand now ? :o)
[06:29:38] <shoky> by reading?
[06:29:46] <tallio> i ll try for sur :)
[06:29:48] <tallio> sure
[06:30:04] <Petazz> shoky: Oh nice. Tried Googling it but couldn't find that page :D
[06:30:37] <sukima> Is there a DOM-free way to attach custom events to an object or should the object implement it's own event system like with this:  https://gist.github.com/sukima/4683467
[06:33:03] <hemanth> Kambfhase, I give up this idea as of now...:{
[06:36:38] <tallio> shoky > i think i understand. delay is the time between all executions. so each delay, we make append the fadein/fadeout... and delay must be time of all executions. if fadein = 5000 and fadeout 5000 delay will be 10000 is that right ?
[06:37:09] <tallio> function(i) => i = one element
[06:39:44] <shoky> tallio: yeah 10000.  i == the current index.  in the fiddle i goes from 0 to 2
[06:40:00] <hemanth> Kambfhase, passing a param to callback would be like function search(term) {$('div').filter(function(term){ return !/term/i.test($(this).text()); }).hide();}
[06:40:04] <sehh> hey people
[06:40:08] <Teduardo> does anyone know of a framework that can handle dynamic forms? I'm getting into the weeds here bigtime =)
[06:40:09] <hemanth> wrong is in't?
[06:40:17] <Kambfhase> yeah.
[06:40:19] <sehh> how can I convert the following command to work with jQuery 1.9.0 and $.support?
[06:40:20] <sehh> if (jQuery.browser.msie) { object = document.documentElement; } else { object = window; }
[06:40:31] <Kambfhase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[06:40:38] <Kambfhase> and, I am afk.
[06:40:49] <hemanth> okies thnx
[06:40:55] <rtyler> I was hoping to find some nice jQuery Mobile aware folks
[06:41:11] <tallio> shoky > that s seems so easy when you do it ...
[06:41:16] <tallio> oO
[06:41:27] <rtyler> I'm seeing this weird issue when changing pages and hitting the back button, where the page transitions "back" and then flashes forward, or transitions to some other page :/
[06:41:57] <shoky> tallio: well, i chose the easy way to do it. it's not a nice solution for when you have many animated elements
[06:42:20] <sehh> any help would be appreciated please
[06:42:55] <shoky> sehh i'm not sure it's as simple as a simple "conversion"
[06:42:57] <tallio> shoky > is that possible with the code to make a repetition and/or restart of all ? setInterval() ?
[06:43:06] <shoky> and i'm not sure that's enough info anyways
[06:43:10] <sehh> oh...
[06:43:33] <shoky> as you can see, i'm not sure ;]
[06:44:10] <sehh> I'll have to detect IE then via the browser ID directly and by-pass jquery then :(
[06:44:11] <shoky> tallio: yep
[06:44:31] <sehh> seems like it was a bad idea to remove $.browser
[06:44:54] <shoky> sehh: ideally you'd find a way to feature-detect whatever it is you're trying to do
[06:44:58] <shoky> instead of browser-detect
[06:45:40] <sehh> ideally IE wouldn't be such crap and we wouldn't need to detect anything
[06:45:42] <shoky> $.support sometimes helps with that.. but just sometimes
[06:45:42] <sehh> :)
[06:45:55] <shoky> we'd still need to detect stuff
[06:46:10] <sehh> I'll use the good old method of:
[06:46:12] <sehh> if (navigator.userAgent.search("MSIE") >= 0){
[06:46:37] <shoky> shrugs
[06:46:37] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:46:43] <lolhii> Can this be done in one line? http://paste.laravel.com/irI
[06:47:36] <shoky> lolhii  .append(x).append(y).append(z)
[06:49:59] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why the performance on this is terrible?: http://decorgroupinc.com/store/firewood-bricks/new/index.php#safe-to-burn-in
[06:51:17] <hadifarnoud> question about append, why doesn't this work? https://gist.github.com/hadifarnoud/7191616dc2a7f7a9b7ce#file-file-js-L417
[06:53:27] <shoky> hadifarnoud:  the append works, you called it correctly. maybe its not what you intended or something, make a jsfiddle showing the problem if you want
[06:53:49] <hadifarnoud> shoky: I think I put it in wrong place?
[06:54:07] <hadifarnoud> shoky: works if I just write the append line
[06:56:27] <buzzsaw> good morning
[06:57:39] <shoky> hadifarnoud: make a minimal demo jsfiddle if you want further help with that
[06:57:58] <buzzsaw> what is jsfiddle?
[06:58:17] <buzzsaw> I googled it but... cant reach the site
[06:59:05] <BillCriswell> Try jsbin.com instead.
[06:59:30] <buzzsaw> ah... just a place to play with js :-)
[07:00:01] <buzzsaw> nice...
[07:01:11] <hadifarnoud> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/N7u64/
[07:01:13] <buzzsaw> should have done it a while ago but I figured I should start learning jquerey :-)
[07:01:33] <hadifarnoud> line 38
[07:01:43] <loincloth>  
[07:02:02] <buzzsaw>  
[07:02:53] <shoky> hadifarnoud: a jsfiddle showing the problem. not just pasting the same thing in jsfiddle... you're not even calling that function
[07:03:14] <shoky> hadifarnoud: and minimal.
[07:03:46] <hadifarnoud> shoky: if I just put append and that div, it works just fine. problem is when I put it inside this function.
[07:04:09] <Drager> So I'm making a content slider; http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/ I'm currently stuck trying to create a prev button so the previous image will be showed. And if I spam the "Next" it will bug. Any ideas?
[07:04:51] <hadifarnoud> shoky: I need to append testmassive2 values to a div. I don't know how else I can do it outside this function since the scope of testmassive2 is just for inside this func
[07:05:41] <shoky> hadifarnoud: i cant help without seeing the problem for myself. im pretty sure your problem is not the append, but something else
[07:05:55] <tallio> shoky > i can't understand how to make all restart => http://pastie.org/6316878
[07:06:26] <shoky> tallio:  i was nice enough to make you a working jsfiddle. please show the same courtesy
[07:06:48] <hadifarnoud> shoky: fair enough. it's bad enough to be a noob in jQuery. I'm actually editing someone else's work.
[07:07:01] <tallio> i am really sorry. i did not want to disturb you or seem inpolish
[07:07:04] <tallio> impolish
[07:07:37] <shoky> tallio: its ok. a fiddle is something i can fiddle with.. if you give me a pastebin i just have to copy it all to jsfiddle in order to see what it actually does
[07:07:54] <tallio> i did not know fiddle i will use it now
[07:08:01] <shoky> sure you did..
[07:09:15] <Drager> Noone has an idea about my problems?
[07:12:35] <shoky> tallio: http://jsfiddle.net/VNfzf/1/
[07:13:36] <momomomomo_> Drager: did you resolve your issue?
[07:13:42] <tallio> shoky > thank you. i will try to understand now how you did
[07:13:44] <Drager> momomomomo_: I did not
[07:14:48] <BillCriswell> Drager: Don't take this the wrong way... but the 1,000 plugins out there for doing this aren't enough or can't get you close enough to what you need with a few modifications?
[07:15:26] <momomomomo> Drager: what is your issue? I didn't see the question?
[07:16:10] <Drager> BillCriswell: I just wanted something simple and I found some nice ones but they didnt do as I wanted with all the different divs and what not
[07:16:20] <Drager> momomomomo: So I'm making a content slider; http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/ I'm currently stuck trying to create a prev button so the previous image will be showed. And if I spam the "Next" it will bug. Any ideas?
[07:16:33] <CodeFriar> I have a hex encoded string representation of a binary string. How can I use js / jq to convert it back to binary ?
[07:17:34] <momomomomo> CodeFriar: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hex+to+binary+js&l=1
[07:17:49] <shoky> Drager: use setTimeout  not setInterval
[07:17:57] <shoky> Drager: http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/1/
[07:19:01] <shoky> sorry,
[07:19:20] <shoky> Drager: forgot the first timeout.. http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/2/
[07:20:10] <Drager> shoky: Okey, that look nicer
[07:22:09] <Drager> Still buggy and no idea about the prev though
[07:23:26] <shoky> Drager:  you know, when you do: $('.project_slide').fadeOut($fade_time).css('display', 'none');
[07:23:36] <shoky> Drager:  the .css()  happens immedaitely
[07:23:39] <shoky> immediately
[07:23:48] <shoky> it doesn't wait for the fadeOut to complete
[07:23:51] <bajaduddah> How would I use jQuery to go this url with the css class added onLoad of the page: <a href="#login-box" class="login-window">?
[07:24:25] <Drager> shoky: Yeah, I tried to use .stop(true)
[07:24:32] <Drager> but that doesnt really work out so great.
[07:24:46] <shoky> Drager:  in fact, fadeIn and fadeOut already take care of the 'display' property for you
[07:24:54] <pachet> $(function(){$('.login-window') [0].click(); })
[07:25:41] <Drager> shoky: Hmm..
[07:26:51] <Drager> shoky: If I remove .display it will look pretty awful
[07:27:22] <hadifarnoud> shoky: append adds something rather than replacing content inside the selected div. I just want to replace the content inside <div class="select"> not append something to it.
[07:29:28] <dersand> Could someone please explain to me what "function parameters" or "function arguments" is and what they do?
[07:29:29] <bajaduddah> can someone help me with this? http://hastebin.com/kenoneciha.js
[07:30:55] <discorpia> bajaduddah: you want to add the class login-popup to the link? then $('#login-box').addClass('login-popup'); is what you want
[07:31:19] <discorpia> bajaduddah: $() uses css-selectors or dom elements
[07:32:15] <bajaduddah> discorpia: /#login-box is the url, login-popup is the css class
[07:32:55] <hemanth> passing a param to callback within a function, facing issues... function search(term) {$('div').filter(function(term){ return !/term/i.test($(this).text()); }).hide();}
[07:33:21] <hemanth> this.term?
[07:34:08] <shoky> hadifarnoud:  then use .html()
[07:34:17] <hadifarnoud> thanks shoky
[07:36:09] <Kambfhase> function search(term) {$('div').filter(function(term){ return $(this).text().indexOf(term) != -1; }).hide();}
[07:38:02] <hemanth> Kambfhase, I went through that RE link again, it does not mention about passing an RE
[07:38:50] <Kambfhase> you can create new regex via new Regex("string", "flags"), still, that code above might work aswell.
[07:39:09] <pachet> ?eval (function(a,b,c,d){return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);})('these', 'are', 'function', 'arguments') @ dersand
[07:40:10] <CodeFriar> how can I itterate over matches doing a custom replace? I need to convert one tag to another and while I'm at it pull an element off an array to insert -- but I need to know what itteration i'm on to get the right one off the array ?
[07:40:13] <dersand> patchet i was just wondering how they work and why they are used, i really no clue...
[07:42:00] <hemanth> Kambfhase, but that wont be case insensitive, right?
[07:42:13] <Kambfhase> nope
[07:42:43] <Kambfhase> dersand: read this: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[07:43:46] <hemanth> passing a param to a callback with in a function is as easy as function test(param) { $("blah").xyz(function(param) {}) } is in't?
[07:44:10] <Kambfhase> yeah
[07:45:33] <hemanth> hmm oki...
[07:47:03] <hemanth> Kambfhase, PM?
[07:47:10] <Kambfhase> k
[07:48:04] <hemanth> thnx
[07:50:19] <Rajni> hello there
[07:50:59] <Rajni> is there any way i can call a function when some element is ready(fully loaded)? the ('.element').ready() doesnt accomplish that
[07:54:15] <discorpia> bajaduddah: oh sorry, i assumed it was an id, missed the actual html. $('a[href="#login-box"]').addClass('login-popup');
[07:57:02] <NoiseEee> Rajni: what does it mean for an element to be ready? as soon as its rendered its 'loaded'
[07:57:04] <hemanth> Rajni, http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:57:22] <NoiseEee> Rajni: what kind of element are you talking about?
[07:57:26] <pachet> herbie: fully ready
[07:57:34] <pachet> doesnt have quite the same ring to it
[08:01:19] <Rajni> NoiseEee i just want to hide navigation divs till all slideshow images are loaded
[08:01:26] <Rajni> i'm using cycle2 btw
[08:02:32] <mboro> is there any shorther way of doing: $myEl.children().removeClass('active').addClass('hide').end().children('.some-selector').removeClass('hide').addClass('active')?
[08:02:39] <mboro> derp, shorter
[08:02:39] <Rajni> i added the style "display:none" but cycle won't make it block when the slideshow is ready
[08:02:43] <NoiseEee> that might be a tricky workaround; you can see if that library provides a special event that fires when the images are loaded, otherwise you might have to poll for them
[08:03:46] <kelye> hello, are there any known issues with .on() event binds for IE 9 ?
[08:04:26] <kelye> I have something like $('container-selector').on('click dblclick', 'a.class', function () {})
[08:04:44] <mboro> kelye: use .delegate
[08:04:48] <kelye> it works ok for elements that are present in the page
[08:04:59] <kelye> but if I add something with JS it's not
[08:05:07] <NoiseEee> mboro: no, not .delegate its deprecated
[08:05:16] <mboro> NoiseEee: really? better read up
[08:06:12] <kelye> that's what I knew also, on being the preferred method over delegate
[08:06:27] <CodeFriar> Anyway to avoid this? Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[08:06:43] <Cork> NoiseEee: no delegate isn't deprecated
[08:06:47] <Cork> live is
[08:06:47] <NoiseEee> kelye: .on() works fine with IE 9. does the container using .on() exist at page load?
[08:07:07] <NoiseEee> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. "
[08:07:10] <kelye> good one .. might be cloned
[08:07:24] <Cork> NoiseEee: superseded, ya, not deprecated
[08:07:35] <NoiseEee> ah well
[08:07:35] <Cork> as in "its recommended, but you can use either one"
[08:07:37] * NoiseEee shrugs
[08:07:38] <b-ot> NoiseEee: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:08:03] <NoiseEee> clearly the intent in versions > 1.7 is to use .on() though, so folks should keep a heads up
[08:08:30] <Cork> NoiseEee: there's little reason to deprecate delegate or bind as it mappes 1:1 to on
[08:08:43] <Cork> it can be supported at almost no cost
[08:09:13] <Cork> live on the other hand has horrible performance, and shouldn't be used; and that's why it was removed
[08:09:30] <Kambfhase> CodeFriar: Maximum call stack size exceeded? your doing ti wrong
[08:09:54] <CodeFriar> Kambfhase: probably but I don't know any better
[08:10:39] <Cork> CodeFriar: that most likely means you have a recursion function and it lands in an infinite recursion
[08:10:41] <CodeFriar> Kambfhase: having to load images via an api,
[08:11:03] <Cork> CodeFriar: so the browser gets out of free stack positions, that's when you get that error
[08:11:04] <CodeFriar> Cork: works fine for 1, 2 or 3 images... more than that.. .boom
[08:11:09] <Hopsy> anyone here who lives in france?!?
[08:11:25] <Cork> CodeFriar: something is calling function in function in function
[08:11:26] <CodeFriar> I was wondering if using data-uri's that are js generated uses stack positions ?
[08:11:45] <Cork> CodeFriar: normally the stack can be several milion levels deep, so its not just 1-3
[08:12:02] <Cork> CodeFriar: no
[08:12:15] <Cork> data-uri don't affect javascript stacks
[08:13:01] <Cork> CodeFriar: you could ask your browser to dump a stacktrace somewhere to see how big the stack is
[08:13:10] <CodeFriar> Cork: how?
[08:13:22] <Cork> CodeFriar: depends on what browser your using
[08:13:28] <CodeFriar> chrome
[08:13:40] <Cork> CodeFriar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Stack
[08:17:11] <CodeFriar> Cork: this is the stack trace: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86a58ba270bef8c12044
[08:17:40] <pingec> where can I read on jquery and xss prevention? Like how safe .attr() etc. ?
[08:18:39] <CodeFriar> Cork: but it doesn't mean much to me
[08:18:57] <Cork> CodeFriar: hmm thats not very deep
[08:19:24] <CodeFriar> Cork: could it have something to do with the size of the binary being transfered?
[08:19:33] <Cork> CodeFriar: are you sending the image as attribute to a function?
[08:19:47] <Cork> yes
[08:19:59] <CodeFriar> returning to bota
[08:20:01] <CodeFriar> er
[08:20:02] <Cork> each argument to a function is pushed to the stack
[08:21:10] <kelye> is there something I can change in IE to get a decent console output?
[08:21:11] <CodeFriar> so if I'm pushing massive data onto the typed array ...
[08:21:32] <kelye> console.log( {a: 'x'}) => [Object object] is not very helpful
[08:22:12] <Cork> kelye: most debuggers let you inspect the object if you click on it
[08:22:21] <Cork> else you can use JSON.stringify()
[08:23:09] <kelye> well, the console provided by developer tools in IE 9 is not doing anything close to most debuggers
[08:23:21] <kelye> just prints this useless text
[08:26:08] <Cork> kelye: ya, the console in ie sucks
[08:26:26] <Cork> kelye: console.log(JSON.stringify({a: 1}))
[08:26:54] <NoiseEee> kelye: what if you use "debugger;" instead of console.log, stop the script, and inspect
[08:27:30] <kelye> well I'm more of a 'print' rather than debug type of guy
[08:27:35] <Cork> NoiseEee: i don't think ie supports debugger
[08:27:39] <Cork> if i remember correctly
[08:28:01] <NoiseEee> i wouldnt know :
[08:28:01] <NoiseEee> :)
[08:28:19] <Cork> and honestly it doesn't support much of anything when it comes to debugging
[08:28:33] <NoiseEee> kelye: well you'll always get further/more knowledge if you stop and take a peek around whats what, but as Cork mentions who knows if it supports it
[08:28:43] <Cork> just the fact that the page crashes if you use console.log and closes the developer window...
[08:29:05] <Cork> NoiseEee: well console.log normally is enough
[08:29:12] <Cork> and you can't always use debugger
[08:29:31] <Cork> code sent through getscript/ajax script doesn't work with debugger;
[08:32:48] <kelye> NoiseEee: I'm not a front-end dev and it's not my plan to be
[08:33:36] <kelye> so learning how a particular debugger works for a browser is not that tempting
[08:33:49] <kelye> although I do understand the benefits :)
[08:35:49] <mboro> is there any shorter way of doing: $myEl.children().removeClass('active').addClass('hide').end().children('.some-selector').removeClass('hide').addClass('active')?
[08:36:56] <Kambfhase> ?not @ mboro
[08:38:12] <Cork> mboro: not really, but i would prob split it up into separate calls
[08:38:20] <Cork> easier to read
[08:38:31] <mboro> Cork: true - instead of the end()
[08:38:34] <Mottie> mboro: try $('.some-selector').removeClass('hide').addClass('active').siblings().addClass('hide').removeClass('active');
[08:38:51] <mboro> Mottie: I don't want to select the siblings
[08:38:53] <Cork> Mottie: that dosn't do the same thing
[08:39:32] <Mottie> mboro: oh, then it would help to see some HTML
[08:39:49] <Cork> mboro: $myEl.children('.active').removeClass('active').addClass('hide'); $myEl.children('.some-selector').removeClass('hide').addClass('active')
[08:39:54] <Cork> looks a little better to me
[08:40:12] <mboro> Cork: that's prettier. thx!
[08:40:29] <Mottie> prettier but not as efficient
[08:40:29] <Cork> mboro: could you combined the active and hide class?
[08:40:44] <Cork> Mottie: actually its more efficient
[08:40:47] <mboro> Cork: if an element is active, it can't be hidden, no
[08:40:59] <Cork> as you don't loop all elements
[08:41:08] <mboro> true
[08:41:13] <mboro> good point
[08:41:16] <Cork> mboro: no but if it isn't active can it not be hidden?
[08:41:21] <Mottie> you're using .children() twice, it is known to be slower than find
[08:41:38] <mboro> Cork: yes, it can
[08:41:59] <Cork> hmm
[08:42:25] <Cork> mboro: $myEl.find('> .active').removeClass('active').addClass('hide'); $myEl.find('>.some-selector').removeClass('hide').addClass('active') is an alternative
[08:42:38] <Cork> but sure if it will be any different in speed though
[08:42:50] <Mottie> mboro: it might be better to combine your css classes, so you don't need to add one class and remove another
[08:42:51] <mboro> Cork: we're not talking a lot of elements anyway. up to 20 at max
[08:43:07] <mboro> that's true. hide is kind of superfluos
[08:43:17] <mboro> err, superfluous
[08:44:17] <Cork> ya, that was what i asked before too
[08:44:24] <mboro> oh, didn't get that, sorry
[08:44:47] <mboro> thx guys
[08:44:49] <Mottie> Cork: I think that would be even slower... what I meant was define a variable with the children, then filter from there: var $els = $myElm.children(); $els.filter('.active').....
[08:44:58] <NoWired> jqueryui has something to work with grids?
[08:45:16] <Cork> Mottie: those selectors aren't really slow
[08:45:28] <Cork> as the go down to a simple dom query
[08:46:12] <Cork> but ya, optimally its better to try to exclude them if they arn't mandatory
[08:46:15] <Mottie> Cork: I stand corrected, children is faster... http://jsperf.com/find-vs-children-chike
[08:46:21] <marvi> Hi! Anyone using flot and can tell me how I can get auto-scaled max/min values from the axes? graph.getOptions().xaxes[0].min is null. Google is not helpful today.
[08:47:09] <Mottie> marvi: are you in the right channel?
[08:47:10] <Cork> Mottie: i would expect it as its a pure dom call
[08:47:18] <Cork> but wasn't sure :)
[08:47:39] <Mottie> Cork: I'm always learning something new everyday ;)
[08:48:16] <Cork> Mottie: when you don't learn something new while developing, is a day when you did something wrong
[08:48:27] <Mottie> DOH
[08:48:54] <Cork> at least that's my point of view; and is why i like helping in irc channels
[08:49:06] <Mottie> I try :P
[09:00:03] <theshadow> I've created a plugin $.extend($.fn, { myPlugin: function() { return this.each(function () {}); } } ); and it works $('#someelement').myPlugin() but when I chain with a ready the context is the document instead of the element $('#someelement').myPlugin().ready(function () { console.log(this); }); Is there something wrong in my plugin?
[09:03:18] <Mottie> theshadow: you need to add return this at the bottom of your plugin to maintain chainability
[09:03:38] <Mottie> theshadow: $.extend($.fn, { myPlugin: function() { return this.each(function () { /* code here */ return this;  }); } } );
[09:08:18] <kelye> just a quick reminder of my initial problem (found out I had another one meanwhile, solved that) ... so when doing $('container').on('click', 'a.class', function()) the event is not captured in IE9
[09:08:40] <kelye> and, indeed, sometimes even the 'container' is added by cloning
[09:09:07] <theshadow> Mottie: oooh I see it now... dur
[09:12:35] <Storm3y> Hi guys, how would I get http://jsfiddle.net/nwellcome/6PGZE/ to only show when the browser is past the 60 px?
[09:19:58] <kelye> anyone working with plupload?
[09:22:40] <chrisvtx> hello all.  quick question about jquery ui support for css3.  it doesn't look to be well supported in default theme (unless i'm missing something).  anyone know why this is the case?  thanks
[09:28:59] <Ritzton> hello
[09:29:37] <Ritzton> I would like to know how images are displayed with jquery mobile and especially when the size of the image is bigger than the screen ?
[09:31:02] <garbagecollectio> how do i impact all the input boxes on a page even if those input boxes have stronger selectors
[09:31:36] <NoiseEee> garbagecollectio: $('input') ?
[09:31:44] <garbagecollectio> using css
[09:31:49] <NoiseEee> input
[09:31:54] <garbagecollectio> right but if you put it at the top
[09:32:13] <garbagecollectio> and lower down the style sheet there is like div element .class input
[09:32:20] <garbagecollectio> in the css
[09:32:21] <NoiseEee> see !important if you want the initial rule to override iirc, #css
[09:33:02] <derik> how i add .toFixed(2) to  this: $("#valoare").val(data['valoaretotala']);
[09:33:54] <pachet> $('#valoare').val(data.valoaretotala.toFixed(2)), presumably?
[09:33:55] <NoiseEee> derik: well break down that line.
[09:35:26] <pachet> garbagecollectio: if by 'affect' you mean something like $('input').css('display', 'none')
[09:35:42] <pachet> you have the benefit of knowing that instructions that are applied inline are given higher precedence
[09:36:31] <derik> NoiseEee dosen`t work i recive this error Uncaught TypeError: Object 120.00 has no method 'toFixed'
[09:38:12] <kelye> derik: parseFloat(data.valoaretotala).toFixed(2)
[09:38:31] <agu10^> heeey
[09:38:32] <agu10^> (:
[09:38:46] <agu10^> can I use jQuery in a statically typed language? Say jQuery C#
[09:38:50] <pachet> derik: i mean
[09:39:01] <pachet> you want a string with two decimal places
[09:39:10] <pachet> isn't that what you've got already :[
[09:40:06] <kelye> true to that pachet  :D
[09:40:13] <derik> thanks kelye work now
[09:40:56] <kelye> agu10^: ... how do you want to use jquery in C# ? :))
[09:40:59] * pachet wonders if that means kelye's solution is working, or that derik has to leave for work and doesnt have time to try it right now
[09:41:19] <agu10^> kelye, using jQuery-like APIs with C#
[09:41:34] <pachet> for the purpose of what
[09:41:54] <Ritzton> I would like to know how images are displayed with jquery mobile and especially when the size of the image is bigger than the screen ?
[09:42:06] <agu10^> for using a better language than javascript (which is not nice)
[09:42:27] <kelye> right
[09:42:35] <kelye> and c# is the nicest
[09:42:39] <carpii> heh.
[09:42:45] <kelye> short answer, no
[09:42:56] <pachet> no, i mean
[09:43:01] <pachet> jquery abstracts the dom
[09:43:05] <pachet> what would it be abstracting in c
[09:44:15] <agu10^> in C#, it would be abstracting the html dom too
[09:45:13] <Ritzton> nobody is using Jquery Mobile on this channel ? LOL
[09:45:26] <carpii> i tried it ritz, really didnt like it
[09:45:26] <agu10^> Ritzton, what's it for?
[09:45:34] <agu10^> jQuery is not multiplatform?
[09:45:46] <agu10^> have to use different versions for mobile????
[09:45:57] <carpii> oh agu
[09:45:57] <Ritzton> agu10^, it is to make a user interface adapted to mobile very fast
[09:46:08] <carpii> it might be worth just reading up on what jQuery is
[09:46:14] <carpii> because you seem to have a lot of misunderstandings
[09:47:14] <agu10^> i know what jQuery is
[09:47:14] <agu10^> just not what jQuery mobile is
[09:47:58] <NoiseEee> its another library
[09:51:42] <tomasm-> hi, I'm using a 'ghostable' text field which displays instead of some real text (a clone of the input field), and when I paste into the fake clone, I'd like to take that paste information and put it into the real field (to then show())... is there a way to get the text being pasted, without having it change the value of the ghost field?
[09:54:06] <Forbidd3n> Why wouldn't this trigger my custom callback function getRates?
[09:54:07] <Forbidd3n> $(document).trigger('getRates',pageNum);
[09:54:55] <mfilipe> can you guys suggest for me a good gallery plugin like lightbox?
[09:56:17] <shoky> tomasm-:  .val() ?
[09:56:40] <shoky> Forbidd3n: trigger is for triggering events, not functions
[09:56:44] <tomasm-> shoky, well i just dont want the original value altered is all. since this is two fields. one fake "your text here" and another really with the value
[09:57:14] <shoky> tomasm-: why would it be altered if you're not pasting into it ?
[09:57:42] <tomasm-> shoky, sorry, i dont follow
[09:57:47] <shoky> tomasm-: me neither
[09:59:26] <shoky> tomasm-: er, you dont want the clone's value to be altered when you paste into it?
[10:00:04] <tomasm-> shoky, yeah. the clone should stay the same, but the original should take the pasted value. seems my only option is to let the paste happen and then copy the value and reset the clone.
[10:00:20] <shoky> think so
[10:00:21] <tomasm-> ie theres no way to grab the pasted content mid-stream
[10:00:30] <shoky> yep most likely
[10:03:12] <Forbidd3n> shoky: yeah I figured out my issue thanks
[10:03:14] <Forbidd3n> for the response
[10:10:19] <bel3atar> any quick hack to make something similar to sleep() ?
[10:11:36] <shoky> setTimeout
[10:15:04] <derik> how verify that an input text is a number ?
[10:15:13] <Ritzton> I would like to know how images are displayed with jquery mobile and especially when the size of the image is bigger than the screen ? does someone have answer ?
[10:26:40] <maxorator> if I have a variable that contains a Deferred, for example from $.ajax(), then when I add callbacks to the chain, like: deferredVar.done(someFunc)
[10:27:07] <Teduardo> anyone see what im doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/D9ZmS/
[10:27:12] <Teduardo> should be super easy to find lol
[10:27:23] <maxorator> but if I know more of them are attached later, should I do instead: deferredVar = deferredVar.done(someFunc)    ?
[10:28:06] <maxorator> as in, does the return value change when chaining callbacks or does it stay the same?
[10:30:16] <shoky> Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/D9ZmS/2/
[10:30:30] <shoky> maxorator:  no you don't need to do that
[10:31:29] <Teduardo> shoky: now all I need to do is figure out how to add a form field instead of alert, lol =)
[10:31:34] <Teduardo> thanks!
[10:34:38] <Teduardo> shoky: or do you have a better idea? in certain circumstances I want the user to confirm that we can reboot their stuff or that they have a backup etc
[10:37:23] <shoky> Teduardo: no idea what you're asking.. you'll figure it out ;p
[10:39:06] <Teduardo> shoky: it's just for a "submit ticket" form.. depending on what options they select, etc it needs to warn them or request confirmation on several things so that we dont have to send tickets back and forth
[10:41:59] <shoky> Teduardo: decide what kind of warning you want (an alert? a new element? showing a hidden element? etc..) and then ask a specific question if you're stuck ;p
[10:47:58] <Teduardo> shoky: ah; I just want to have it add a checkbox to the form that the user can check to confirm based on which warning it is
[10:48:08] <Teduardo> i think it should be pretty easy to do that
[10:58:56] <didiergm> nesting grids - does anyone know if nesting ui-grid-a/ui-block-a/ui-block-b inside a ui-block-a is meant to work ?
[11:00:48] <didiergm> I mean is it supposed to allow to create two columns inside a column ?
[11:03:22] <agu10^> didiergm, you make another table
[11:06:16] <mfilipe> someone knows where can I find a lightbox that I can use like this http://imagebin.org/247753 ?
[11:22:31] <monteith> where can i find old jquery docs? specifically 1.3.2
[11:26:09] <tubbo> monteith: they're not on api.jquery.com? i thought you could look up old docs..
[11:26:24] <monteith> i just see changelogs
[11:26:25] <tubbo> hey guys i find myself writing this line of jQuery before every plugin that i make: jQuery.fn.accountTabs = (overrides) -> @each (i, tabs_element) -> new AccountTabs(tabs_element)
[11:26:30] <tubbo> that's coffeescript btw :D
[11:26:51] <tubbo> i feel like it would be cool if i could abstract that somehow
[11:27:02] <didiergm> agu10^ so you mean it does what I expect, add another grid inside the column ?
[11:27:22] <tubbo> so if i define a new AccountTabs that extends from some base object, it will just do that line and call the AccountTabs object as the content of the plugin
[11:35:29] <Danielss89> Hi
[11:35:41] <Danielss89> I'm having a problem with getting query to work on newly added dom
[11:35:56] <Danielss89> it works on elements which was there on load
[11:36:08] <Danielss89> but if i add an image dynamcly, it doesn't fire..
[11:36:30] <yogurt_truck> Danielss89: use event delegation
[11:36:34] <Danielss89> i use $('img').on('click', function(){ console.log('hi'); });
[11:37:06] <Skyflyer> i'm having trouble connecting a click link to a specific div to toggle.  I have 4 links and 4 different divs. but want just one simple function to do a toggle and connect them ?
[11:37:22] <Danielss89> yogurt_truck: shouldn't "on" delegate?
[11:37:40] <culh> use 'live' instead of 'on'
[11:37:47] <yogurt_truck> Danielss89: not the way you're using it
[11:37:54] <yogurt_truck> culh: no.
[11:38:01] <culh> it'll work.
[11:38:05] <Danielss89> culh: thats deprecated
[11:38:06] <yogurt_truck> Danielss89: see the docs for on
[11:38:08] <Danielss89> not in 1.91
[11:38:19] <Danielss89> yogurt_truck: ok
[11:38:24] <yogurt_truck> culh: stop recommending .live
[11:38:35] <culh> i use it all day
[11:39:08] <yogurt_truck> culh: good for you. now stop recommending other people to use deprecated
[11:39:16] <yogurt_truck> ... functions
[11:48:14] <culh> I made a CMS with a navegation control. The href value is used to load class/function/params and the hash # is used to target the load() function. Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/qs8QHaMs  question: how can I implement the onhashchange plugin (or similar) to be able to use the browser's 'back' button and work with my current navegation?
[11:48:39] <basiclaser> i have been studying query for 4 days, I have seen many demos and run many demos in jsfiddle, but not ONCE have been able to see any code respond in my own projects :P i am cursed!
[11:48:53] <jacobroufa> any idea why .ajax() would cache jsonp but not json?
[11:49:20] <jacobroufa> i have a page that requests some data and when i give it dataType: 'jsonp' i get back an old set of data
[11:49:27] <jacobroufa> when i tell it dataType: 'json' i get the latest results
[11:50:03] <jacobroufa> with a request something like http://url.com/?q=a&callback=jQuery182036231466638855636_1361561206501&_=1361561390500
[11:50:17] <jacobroufa> where it shouldnt have that last part (&callback=blahblahblah) at the end
[11:52:14] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: you are at least in the right place
[11:52:36] <basiclaser> i have been able to conjure alert() but that is it,
[11:52:57] <basiclaser> sliding menus, fadeIn(), nothing will work in my site even if it works elsewhere :P
[11:53:46] <basiclaser> but yeh this channel is very helpful :)
[11:53:55] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: use console.log() to debug.  -- if you share your code people can help.. jsfiddle
[11:54:27] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: i almost completely learned jQuery in this chan, nothing is immediate
[11:55:12] <basiclaser> I am not deterred at all, Im really enjoying, i think i have a lot of cool ideas to turn into webapps!
[11:55:46] <basiclaser> when did you start learning? oh and btw do i just manually type name: to ping someone like you did to me>
[11:57:26] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: I use irc client.. typing first few letters than hit <tab> to auto complete the name. -- the client will flash and highlight anything with my nick
[11:57:46] <basiclaser> jrockjiggz: got it :)
[11:58:14] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: its mostly to keep a conversation unique when theres more than one
[11:58:37] <basiclaser> jrockjiggz: loud party scenario :D
[11:58:46] <jrockjiggz> sometimes ;)
[12:01:40] <basiclaser> i would send you a jsfiddle of my conundrum but jsfiddle isn't repsonding to me atm :P
[12:02:23] <ill0> codepen maybe?
[12:02:32] <jrockjiggz> yea.. its really too bad.. when it works its great
[12:02:41] <jrockjiggz> its very popular i guess
[12:04:33] <basiclaser> yeh give it time, they will become  a perfect service
[12:04:57] <jrockjiggz> ?pase
[12:04:59] <jrockjiggz> ?paste
[12:05:17] <jrockjiggz> i would hope bot-t becomes reliable too
[12:05:56] <basiclaser> Im just fiddling it now
[12:07:46] <basiclaser> here you go fellas http://cdpn.io/aeDhB
[12:07:57] <basiclaser> the very same code worked nicely in jsfiddle
[12:08:20] <basiclaser> doesn't seem to work in there though :P
[12:08:29] <Emn1ty|Work> does anyone know of any good plugins/apis for allowing direct editing of an html element's text and giving you the ability to use some rich text editing functions (bold, italic, font, size, color, etc)?
[12:09:13] <Emn1ty|Work> currently we have a window open up underneath the html element with a rich text editor field, but that's not really what I want.
[12:13:45] <basiclaser> jrockjiggz: did you make anything of those files buddy?
[12:14:01] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: open console. it says 'Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined '
[12:14:06] <jrockjiggz> meaning, your not loading jquery
[12:14:23] <basiclaser> :O
[12:14:38] <Emn1ty|Work> my question was answered btw, just fyi
[12:14:43] <jrockjiggz> ok
[12:15:00] <basiclaser> i thought that might be the issue so on my site i have <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:15:01] <basiclaser> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:15:02] <basiclaser> <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/libs/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[12:15:03] <basiclaser> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[12:15:04] <basiclaser> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://jqueryui.com/latest/ui/ui.core.js"></script>
[12:15:12] <basiclaser> but to no avail
[12:16:09] <jrockjiggz> you have multiple versions of jQuery?
[12:17:05] <jrockjiggz> basiclaser: when i view source, i do not see anything of that
[12:17:27] <basiclaser> i didn't put it in the code pen sorry
[12:17:33] <basiclaser> which src's should i include?
[12:22:40] <Ziggy`> Can I specify "headers" within ajaxSetup only for urls not starting with http ?
[12:24:01] <Ziggy`> e.g. I have this -> $.ajaxSetup({ headers: { 'X-Socket-ID': 'foo' }); -> In one case I need to ignore this setup.
[12:24:56] <basiclaser> jrockjiggz: which src's should i include for that basic input to background function?
[12:30:16] <jeffreylevesque> i have a child container inside an anchor. Is there a way to remove the clickable behavior of the link on the child container?
[12:36:21] <neoandresson> k
[12:42:37] <SoulRaven> hello
[12:43:07] <SoulRaven> please help me with something, i don't know way i get this error, when i try to retrive from a web app, a jsson string
[12:43:13] <SoulRaven> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[12:43:22] <SoulRaven> the string is encoded in php
[12:43:41] <SoulRaven> but in jquery i get this error, when i try to retrive the string
[12:43:48] <Mottie> SoulRaven: check the JSON using http://jsonlint.com/
[12:44:14] <SoulRaven> is valid
[12:45:26] <Mottie> SoulRaven: please share your code then :P
[12:45:34] <SoulRaven> http://acm.acronshop.ro/
[12:45:42] <SoulRaven> this is the web app, that i am working on
[12:45:46] <SoulRaven> look in the console
[12:46:21] <SoulRaven> and the code is this: http://pastebin.com/sdQr1cfk
[12:49:01] <Rickardo1> Is it possible to set a form to invalidate elements with jquery validate manually?
[12:49:31] <Mottie> SoulRaven: I think the problem is that the call needs to end with "?jsoncallback=?" and not "&callback=?"
[12:49:39] <someprimetime> Rickardo1: you could trigger a submit event on the form perhaps
[12:49:49] <someprimetime> assuming the plugin is attached to it
[12:50:10] <SoulRaven> the same think, and nothing
[12:50:12] <Rickardo1> someprimetime: Ok, I do my ajax call on submitHandler
[12:50:36] <Rickardo1> But when I got false from serverside I want to invalid both username and password.
[12:51:00] <Mottie> SoulRaven: Change the "&" to "?"
[12:51:47] <SoulRaven> now i get: GET http://web.acronshop.ro/index.php?option=com_joomcake&task=userSessionJ&for…son?jsoncallback=jQuery191038544370722956955_1361566278188&_=1361566278189 500 (Internal Server Error)
[12:52:59] <Mottie> SoulRaven: that's a server side issue then... not sure how to fix that
[12:53:51] <Mottie> SoulRaven: can you load the JSON in the browser?

I need to remove x-socket-id from the header when I make the ajax call to youtube, I've tried a bunch of things, doing xhr.setRequestHea

[12:54:39] <Ziggy`> Anyone?
[12:55:17] <Mottie> SoulRaven: oh ok so you do need the "&" in the url
[12:55:50] <SoulRaven> yes
[12:58:17] <Mottie> SoulRaven: did you try changing the dataType to  'jsonp'?
[12:58:32] <SoulRaven> yes, and is not working

[13:00:07] <nym> I am using Modernizr 2.6.3 and I can't seem to see a "no-touch" or "touch" class on my HTML element. I looked through the docs and googled, no answers yet
[13:00:24] <nym> if anyone can help out that would be amazing :)

[13:03:35] <EyePulp> just a quick gut check… If a page@ foo.com has an iframe with a src of www.bar.com,  and the page in that if ram has a script file that does a $.post('/some/relative/path/', data, function(){});  <-- the post destination will be based off the iframe src, not the parent browser window, right?
[13:05:56] <EyePulp> *"in that iframe"
[13:06:12] * EyePulp loves autocorrect
[13:06:24] <snover> EyePulp: that is correct.
[13:07:12] <EyePulp> but the referrer… would be the parent www.bar.com page, right?
[13:07:14] <EyePulp> maybe?
[13:07:42] <EyePulp> in the request that hits the posted destination
[13:10:52] <culh> I made a CMS with a navegation control. The href value is used to load class/function/params and the hash # is used to target the load() function. Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/qs8QHaMs  question: how can I implement the onhashchange plugin (or similar) to be able to use the browser's 'back' button and work with my current navegation?
[13:12:19] <culh> I'm trying to modify my current code to another pattern that uses all the information after the hash: #<val1>,<val2>,(...);targetElementId
[13:12:55] <culh> This way the browser will keep history plus the back button working, right?
[13:13:04] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[13:13:08] <query> Hi
[13:13:17] <SoulRaven> i am stuck with this error, and json
[13:13:22] <SoulRaven> and i don't know what to do
[13:13:33] <yedimind> panic!
[13:13:48] <Cork> culh: you shouldn't abuse the href like that, use a data- attribute instead
[13:14:05] <query> cork
[13:14:36] <query> can i ask you question
[13:14:49] <Cork> SoulRaven: your responding with json to a jsonp request
[13:14:51] <culh> Cork: that way I'd have to keep 2 patterns per anchor?
[13:14:54] <Cork> query: you just did :)
[13:14:58] <Cork> don't ask to ask, just ask
[13:15:05] <query> ok
[13:15:06] <query> http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/
[13:15:13] <query> do you know this
[13:15:30] <Cork> culh: data-extra="{<json>}"
[13:15:57] <culh> is that a valid attr?
[13:16:04] <culh> nevermind, i'll look it up ;)
[13:16:08] <Cork> culh: yes
[13:16:18] <Cork> its part of the whatwg spec
[13:16:33] <query> cork
[13:16:36] <Cork> just remeber to escape the json in the attribute
[13:16:52] <Cork> query: i've never needed a news ticker, so no
[13:17:02] <query> ok
[13:17:07] <query> the probleme is
[13:17:12] <culh> can't say I'm too keen on using json
[13:17:25] <query> it is not working with xml rss feed
[13:17:29] <Cork> culh: so use two attributes in stead
[13:17:32] <query> i dont know why
[13:17:55] <Cork> but parsing the url for arbitrary data...
[13:18:18] <culh> I'm parsing already, so it's not too much of an effort
[13:18:33] <Cork> query: if you have a testcase i could have a look, but its not very likely that i can spot it
[13:18:51] <culh> I need to combine the hash values with my server side class/function loading method + js navegation
[13:18:58] <Cork> culh: my point is you shouldn't be doing it in the first place
[13:19:33] <culh> Cork: the information isn't sensitive, but I agree
[13:19:41] <query> ok
[13:19:59] <Cork> sensitive doesn't have anything to do with it
[13:20:05] <Cork> the has isn't normally sent to the sever anyway
[13:20:08] <Cork> *hash
[13:20:10] <tubbo> anybody know how to tell jQuery ui.tabs to just START on a specific tab?
[13:20:16] <query> cork can you show me how to make a marquee rss feed by jquery ?
[13:20:22] <tubbo> i thought it was like $('#my-tabs').tabs('load', '1')...
[13:20:34] <tubbo> i already have tabs() instantiated fwiw
[13:21:04] <culh> Cork: is the information from the data- attr kept by the browser on history?
[13:21:41] <culh> no, right? so the hash value is important to load sensitive data
[13:22:51] <Cork> tubbo: its active not load
[13:23:09] <Cork> load loads the content of said tab if its a remote loaded content
[13:23:41] <Cork> culh: no the ash is meant to match id's in the page
[13:23:52] <Cork> not contain arbitrary data
[13:24:20] <Cork> and if your data would match an id the page would scroll there
[13:25:05] <culh> ye but I'm using preventDefault(); and an extra code triggered manually for when I really want the browser to scroll to the target element
[13:25:15] <Cork> ...
[13:25:33] <Cork> it doesn't change that your using a target hash for data storage
[13:25:47] <culh> so I'm wondering about different approaches
[13:26:23] <Cork> the correct approach is to store it either in javascript or as data- attribute
[13:26:59] <Cork> if you want the html to contain it the data-<what ever> is the best place
[13:27:46] <culh> how else would you do it if not placing data in the DOM
[13:28:04] <Cork> you could store it as an array in javascript
[13:28:17] <Cork> and match it ageist something in the dom
[13:28:37] <culh> That's for predefined values only (?)
[13:28:59] <Cork> no it can be server dynamic
[13:29:14] <culh> That'd use another layer of abstraction
[13:29:14] <Cork> it all depends on how you prefer to structure it
[13:29:22] <culh> like a preload.php class or similat
[13:29:25] <culh> similar*
[13:29:38] <Cork> well you asked "how" and i told you
[13:30:09] <culh> ye, ok. just comparing notes for now
[13:30:42] <Cork> also if your not having working targets for those links, you shouldnt be using a tags to begin with
[13:31:00] <Cork> filling the page with broken links isn't needed
[13:31:07] <Cork> (anymore)
[13:31:51] <culh> all links have targets
[13:32:06] <culh> (in my cms solution that is)
[13:32:09] <Cork> so they work even with js disabled?
[13:32:25] <culh> no. no js, no gain
[13:32:32] <Cork> then its broken links
[13:32:40] <Cork> and shouldn't be links to start with
[13:33:07] <culh> that doesn't mean a broken methodology
[13:33:34] <Cork> adding a link to the page, that isn't a link, is semantically wrong
[13:33:44] <Cork> it should be ex. a <span> with some styling instead
[13:33:49] <basiclaser> are there any api's that can light up a smartphone screen after an amount of time? or make it beep?
[13:33:56] <supsup> has anyone ever run into a serialization problem with IE, where it will not serialize a radio that has been 'checked' via Javascript?
[13:34:24] <Cork> supsup: are you checking it though attr or prop?
[13:34:56] <supsup> attr
[13:35:16] <Cork> basiclaser: beep can be done with <audio>, don't think theres a way to light the screen, but i haven't looked for it
[13:35:25] <Cork> supsup: use .prop('checked', true)
[13:35:33] <Cork> attr is for attributes not properties
[13:36:37] <supsup> nice...i'll submit bug to plugin guy with quote from Cork.
[13:36:43] <supsup> weird it works in FF/Chrome
[13:36:51] <supsup> but yah that fixed IE
[13:37:12] <supsup> thanks Cork
[13:40:12] <culh> Found what I need: history manipulation for non html5 browsers
[13:42:12] <alaing> anyone going to jquery uk conf?
[13:43:38] <micz123> hi all, newbie here. How do i prepare data to send thru jquery.ajax? I have a set of data from data-attributes in div (example: data-class="fruit" data-type="orange"
[13:43:48] <jChristoph> So I'm using the jQuery migrate utility to help me upgrade to the latest version.  With it, I've run across something interesting and I'm hoping that someone can tell me what's going on.  If I do something like $(':radio[value="All"]'), the migrate utility throws a message saying "JQMIGRATE: property-based jQuery.fn.attr('value') is deprecated".  But if I change it to $('input[type="radio"][value="All"]') then no message displays.  I tho
[13:43:48] <jChristoph> ught that ':radio' was the same as '[type="radio"]'?  What's going on?
[13:45:10] <machty> can't find this answer anywhere, but do jQuery promises abide by Promise/A or A+?
[13:45:57] <Whirl3d> JCristoph, is "input:radio" the same as ":radio"? perhaps jqmobile is having problems with the lack of specificity on the base search? does "input:radio" throw the same error?
[13:46:41] <jChristoph> Whirl3d: yes, it does.
[13:47:02] <micz123> Sorry for retyping. A newbie question: How do i prepare data to send thru jquery.ajax? I have a set of data from data-attributes in div (example: data-class="fruit" data-type="orange")
[13:47:10] <Whirl3d> hmmm...but input[type='radio'] doesnt?
[13:47:36] <jChristoph> actually, sorry, 'input:radio' does not throw the error
[13:48:03] <jChristoph> but according to api.jquery.com/radio-selector/ [:radio] is equivalent to [type="radio"]
[13:48:23] <Whirl3d> jChristoph, it might be because the :radio attribute selector ONLY works for input elements.
[13:48:49] <Whirl3d> jChristoph, I'm totally guessing, but it might be having a problem getting the :rado attribute of non input elements.
[13:49:18] <NoiseEee> micz123: something like:  data = { type: $el.attr('data-type'), theClass: $el.attr('data-class')}
[13:49:46] <jChristoph> Whirl3d, well, wouldn't that mean that the 'input' is implicit?  'input:radio' is the same as ':radio'.  But I see your point.
[13:50:32] <Whirl3d> I would think so, but maybe that's a shortcut or a luxury that was skipped in jqmobile for sake of size or something? Again, totally just guessing.
[13:51:25] <Whirl3d> otherwise there would have to be a huge table of attr selector specific base elements to subs in.
[13:51:46] <jChristoph> changing my select from ':radio' to explicitly be 'input:radio' makes the jquery migrate utility happy.  odd.  learn something new every day. :p
[13:52:13] <Whirl3d> Glad you got it working. Still it would be good to hear from an expert why it is that way.
[13:52:39] <Mottie> jChistoph: In the docs, it states "the bare $(':radio') is equivalent to $('*:radio'), so $('input:radio') should be used instead"
[13:53:06] <Whirl3d> Mottie++
[13:53:27] <jChristoph> Mottie: The first sentence states "$(':radio') is equivalent to $('[type=radio]')."
[13:53:37] <machty> are jQuery promises A or A+?
[13:53:49] <micz123> noiseeee thx a lot :D
[13:53:55] <jChristoph> If I explicitly use the latter then the migrate utility is fine.
[13:54:00] <jChristoph> So they aren't quite the same
[13:54:28] <NoiseEee> micz123: np
[13:54:28] <nesoi> so I'm trying to use this simpledialog2 plugin, and I'm getting it to work, except that when a button in the dialog is clicked, the listview which is under it also gets a click. What should I try to stop that?
[13:55:17] <yedimind> wizards
[13:56:43] <micz123> noiseeee can i set variables first? ex: var myclass= $el.attr('data-class') var mytype=$el.attr('data-type') data={type: mytype, theClass= myclass}
[13:57:50] <NoiseEee> micz123: certainly
[13:58:33] <nesoi> I tried setting a global variable when the popup pops which is checked by the code which responds to the click event for the underlying listview, but somehow that's not working either.
[13:58:39] <micz123> noiseeee just great :D Thx again
[14:01:37] <yedimind> NoiseEee is not _just_ great
[14:01:43] <yedimind> he's also kinda dreamy
[14:01:44] * yedimind swoons
[14:01:51] * NoiseEee tosses out candy to all
[14:03:01] <Wolfed> God I hate my ISP -_-
[14:03:02] <Wolfed> Hello guys, I have this little function which prints the contents of a <div></div> linked to a "title",  into another <div></div>, but I need to delete the content from the original div and put it back if another main "title" is clicked: http://jsfiddle.net/GJFZu/ So far I have this, I just can't figure out how to work removing the data and putting it back up. Anyone might help me?
[14:06:25] <nesoi> no one has any ideas for how to stop an event from triggering an element underneath a popup dialog?
[14:07:10] <Ritzton>  I would like to know how images are displayed with jquery mobile and especially when the size of the image is bigger than the screen ?
[14:10:03] <supsup> Wolfred: what do you mean by "work removing the data and putting it back up"
[14:11:13] <supsup> nesoi: maybe z-index problem.  Also you could unbind the event, then reattach it on close of dialog
[14:11:58] <Wolfed> Well
[14:12:27] <Wolfed> I need to delete the contents from the original (hidden) div and put them back where they initially were.
[14:12:45] <nesoi> supsup : how would I diagnose a z-index problem, and how would I unbind and rebind? :)
[14:13:35] <supsup> look up css z-index, and know it's parent has to have positioning set even if relative.
[14:13:44] <supsup> unbind is on jquery api page
[14:14:11] <supsup> you should not have to unbind and reattach would be weird solution
[14:14:47] <supsup> Wolfred, so what is the contents of the original hidden div?  is it in the example?
[14:14:55] <supsup> as far as I can see it's just empty?
[14:14:58] <nesoi> supsup : what do you mean by " know it's parent has to have positioning set even if relative."?
[14:15:00] <supsup> are you going to have a button you click
[14:15:11] <Milos|Work> he means "its"
[14:15:27] <Wolfed> In the original example for example, in "Test 1" I have "This is merely a test"
[14:15:42] <supsup> nesoi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Understanding_z-index
[14:15:55] <Wolfed> When you click on Test 1, "This is merely a test" gets copied into the div with class view_box, which is visible.
[14:15:58] <Wolfed> Right?
[14:16:15] <supsup> yeah
[14:16:48] <Wolfed> I need to delete "<div style="display: none">This is merely a test</div>", and place it in .view_box when clicking "Title 1"
[14:17:20] <supsup> where is this "Title 1"
[14:17:46] <Wolfed> And if you click Title 2,  "<div style="display: none">This is merely a test</div>" gets back where it initially was (Right after Title 1) and then "This is merely a test 2" appears in .view_box
[14:17:49] <supsup> I do not see a way to click it
[14:17:53] <Wolfed> I meant Test 1, not Title 1. Sorry :P
[14:18:04] <supsup> oh
[14:18:05] <supsup> ok
[14:18:25] <supsup> does it not already do that?
[14:18:35] <Wolfed> It copies the data, doesnt delete the original one.
[14:19:39] <luckysmack> i am using jqui dialog, and I am using a simeple text area. when the user closes the dialog I want to take the content of the text area and use that after the dialog is closed. But once its closed I cant seem to keep those values. it just disappears.
[14:19:45] <luckysmack> here is an example http://jsfiddle.net/nVNVg/
[14:20:17] <Wolfed> hum, I just thought of something. Is it possible to name a variable after an id? like "var $(this).prop('id') = "Test"?
[14:20:34] <Wolfed> Doubt it actually. lol
[14:20:38] <nesoi> supsup : I have the zindex of the popup set to 10000. the default was 1000 but for some reason it wasn't appearing on top
[14:21:18] <supsup> nesoi: so your saying it is not working?
[14:21:41] <supsup> Wolfed: do you want it to do what it does now in a different way?  Still not getting what your saying.
[14:21:57] <Wolfed> lol
[14:22:04] <supsup> when you click "Test 1" Text appears.  When you click it again, Text goes away.
[14:22:14] <supsup> the other cases are repeated pattern
[14:22:26] <Wolfed> Right now I am copying the html next to "Title 1", I need to move it back and forth
[14:23:04] <supsup> why?
[14:24:05] <supsup> prob better would be to use .data
[14:25:35] <Wolfed> Because I am going to use some id tags on this and the script won't work if they are repeated
[14:25:35] <Wolfed> :P
[14:25:53] <Wolfed> I guess I could also rename all the IDs too
[14:26:15] <Wolfed> Just thought there'd be a nicer way to do this
[14:29:23] <supsup> trying to make something still dont' get the point tho .
[14:30:34] <supsup> I think you will have to have some kind of ID.  at least on the containers
[14:38:27] <JayT> http://pastebin.com/XGyjChJV How can I specify for only the div tag with id button_1 under input should have this effect work? and not all inputs.
[14:40:28] <NoiseEee> JayT: well you only have a single element with the ID, so just grab it on its own.  $('button_1')
[14:40:33] <NoiseEee> JayT: well you only have a single element with the ID, so just grab it on its own.  $('#button_1')
[14:41:29] <NoiseEee> #('#button_1 input'); //only inputs within the element #button_1
[14:46:34] <zDog> is there a way to know if an element resizes (not the browser?)
[14:53:44] <heshanh> how can i attach a datepicker to a dynamic input. i have a button that duplicates the last tr of the table and appends it to the end of the table. each table row has a input text
[14:56:30] <andrea22k> hi guys
[14:56:37] <andrea22k> can someone help me?
[15:00:04] <andrea22k> noone? :(
[15:03:29] <supsup> you still around Wolfed?
[15:03:49] <yogurt_truck> andrea22k: just ask your question and someone might help you at some point
[15:04:41] <andrea22k> it takes some time
[15:04:44] <supsup> here is my attempt to do what you wanted anyway, prob still don't understand what u mean tho  http://jsfiddle.net/GJFZu/1/
[15:04:50] <supsup> Wolfed
[15:04:58] <Mottie> andrea22k: just ask, and share a link to a demo if you would
[15:05:09] <andrea22k> ok
[15:06:33] <andrea22k> http://www.wrongpeople.it/galleria2.html
[15:07:03] <andrea22k> those pictures are thumbnails of a gallery
[15:07:59] <andrea22k> when i click one of them the <a> gets attribute class="selected"
[15:09:05] <andrea22k> each one of these a has a href like #fotoxxx
[15:09:15] <andrea22k> example #foto001, #foto002
[15:10:20] <andrea22k> there are some span in my html with respective ids #fotoxxx
[15:11:15] <andrea22k> i need to pass to the one selected by the thumbnails the css display:block. default is display:hide
[15:11:19] <andrea22k> how can i do?
[15:13:03] <supsup> do they have class on them before that
[15:13:08] <supsup> before you click
[15:13:16] <supsup> class="icon" or something
[15:13:16] <andrea22k> no
[15:13:22] <supsup> so u have a click event already
[15:13:26] <supsup> that adds a class tho?
[15:13:31] <andrea22k> yes
[15:13:37] <supsup> is it a jquery click event?
[15:13:38] <andrea22k> thumbs don't have class
[15:13:41] <andrea22k> yes
[15:13:48] <Mottie> andrea22k: it looks like the spans are inside of a second caroufredsel.... I can't even see it
[15:13:48] <andrea22k> u click and it gains a class
[15:13:58] <andrea22k> yes
[15:14:09] <andrea22k> mottie u're right
[15:14:22] <andrea22k> i want to give to the span
[15:14:28] <andrea22k> a class
[15:14:45] <andrea22k> defined in css with disply: block
[15:14:59] <andrea22k> to create something like lightbox
[15:15:49] <supsup> just add something like this to your existing click event:  $($(this).href).css("display","block);
[15:16:02] <Mottie> I think having the span inside of a second courfredsel makes it more difficult... usually you can just target the span as follows: $( $('a.selected').attr('href') ).show();
[15:16:23] <supsup> or yah .show lol
[15:16:25] <andrea22k> supsup it will add the display block to the a
[15:16:29] <Mottie> andrea22k: but because it's inside of a courFredsel, it's positioned somewhere else
[15:16:37] <andrea22k> in the thumb carousel
[15:17:05] <andrea22k> i need to add it to the span in the second carousel
[15:17:15] <Mottie> andrea22k: add what?
[15:17:48] <andrea22k> i'll explain with an example
[15:18:32] <Mottie> if I was doing it, I'd hide the spans (not in another carousel) and target them using a light box plugin
[15:19:20] <andrea22k> <div id="thumbs">             	<a href="#foto001"><img src="collezioni/SS13/thumbs/foto01.png" /></a>                 <a href="#foto002"><img src="collezioni/SS13/thumbs/foto02.png" /></a>         </div>
[15:19:43] <andrea22k> <div id="carousel"> 				<span id="foto001"><img src="collezioni/SS13/large/foto001.png" /></span> 				<span id="foto002"><img src="collezioni/SS13/large/foto02.png" /></span>      </div>
[15:20:30] <andrea22k> when i click on first thumb. it becomes <a href="foto001 class="selected">
[15:20:48] <Mottie> andrea22k: yes, we understand that
[15:21:11] <andrea22k> i need that <span id="foto001"> gets another class to display it
[15:21:12] <andrea22k> ok
[15:21:13] <andrea22k> :)
[15:21:39] <andrea22k> sorry i wasn't sure cause of my bad english
[15:21:41] <andrea22k> :)
[15:21:47] <Mottie> andrea22k: $( $('a.selected').attr('href') ).addClass('selected');
[15:22:14] <Mottie> andrea22k: but then you need to remove the class on the other spans... it'll just get messy
[15:22:34] <andrea22k> my code is
[15:22:37] <Mottie> andrea22k: actually, if you
[15:22:41] <kfrazier> I am trying write a plugin override the default ajaxTransport for all types, but I really just want to postprocess the results of the default implementation. I can't see a way to get at the default ajax transport, since it defined inline as an anonymous function and the object that contains it is within the closure scope of the anonymous function that wraps the whole file. Is this possible?
[15:22:43] <Mottie> please don't post it here
[15:23:07] <andrea22k> ok
[15:23:39] <Mottie> andrea22k: if you want to share code, please post it on a snippet site or in a demo... and you shared a demo
[15:23:57] <supsup> Wolfed i'm out, going to drink, here was my attempt at your problem, with no feedback unsure if it is what you want.  http://jsfiddle.net/GJFZu/1/
[15:24:13] <andrea22k> it's short
[15:24:25] <andrea22k> $('#thumbs a').click(function() { $('#thumbs a').removeClass('selected'); 	$(this).addClass('selected'); 	return false; });
[15:24:32] <supsup> lol
[15:24:46] <andrea22k> this is how i get the selected class
[15:25:02] <Mottie> andrea22k: and thats where you can add the code to target the span
[15:26:12] <Mottie> andrea22k: what I was trying to say was that if you want to show an image, it might be better to use a lightbox plugin... then you can just target the image url within the thumbnail and not have to bother with a second carousel with spans
[15:26:21] <andrea22k> how? i mean i need two conditions: thumbs a href = carousel span id  && thumbs a class ='selected'
[15:26:38] <andrea22k> i know
[15:26:50] <andrea22k> but i having some troubles with lightbox
[15:27:03] <andrea22k> and i'd like to have full control on my code
[15:27:05] <Mottie> andrea22k: which lightbox are you using?
[15:27:25] <Mottie> andrea22k: oh so you want to write it yourself?
[15:27:40] <andrea22k> i tried lightbox 2
[15:27:43] <andrea22k> yes
[15:28:41] <andrea22k> but i don't know why. it didn't works
[15:28:54] <basiclaser> oh i just turned 23 half an hour ago ^ ^ i didn't notice
[15:29:06] <Mottie> Happy Birthday!
[15:29:13] <Wolfed> Is it possible to get the nth class from an element?
[15:29:27] <basiclaser> :D thanks
[15:29:32] <andrea22k> happy birthday
[15:31:56] <basiclaser> lol i love how birthdays are meaningless when you never do anything, never go out and just read about computers :3
[15:33:57] <Pixz> Hi there !
[15:36:40] <andrea22k> Mottie are u trying to solve my problem? :P
[15:36:52] <Mottie> andrea22k: yes, working on a demo
[15:37:06] <andrea22k> thanks!
[15:38:45] <shoky> Wolfed: what do you mean?
[15:42:18] <Mottie> andrea22k: this is a basic demo using colorbox: http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/yM7FD/
[15:42:38] <Mottie> andrea22k: the href of the a points to the full sized image
[15:42:52] <Wolfed> Yay I did it!
[15:43:11] <Mottie> andrea22k: and when the lightbox opens, you can navigate to other full sized images
[15:44:20] <andrea22k> i'm taking a look :) thanks
[15:46:01] <andrea22k> is colorbox free for commercial use?
[15:47:24] <Mottie> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox MIT license
[15:48:36] <andrea22k> so yes i mean! :P
[15:48:42] <Mottie> hehe yeah
[15:49:15] <andrea22k> i'll try with colorbox
[15:49:30] <andrea22k> but tomorrow! i'm tired
[15:49:36] <andrea22k> i'm done for today!
[15:49:36] <Mottie> lol me too
[15:49:42] <Mottie> me too ;)
[15:49:46] <andrea22k> just wanna thank u for your support
[15:49:48] <Mottie> have a great weekend!
[15:49:52] <Mottie> not a problem
[15:49:54] <andrea22k> i appreciate so much :)
[15:50:09] <andrea22k> thanks you too
[15:50:16] <andrea22k> bye all guys!
[15:58:00] <garciawebdev> does anybody knows why calling the jQuery UI accordion plugin on a element triggers "Error: SyntaxError: DOM Exception 12"?
[15:58:28] <garciawebdev> "stack: "Error: An invalid or illegal string was specified.↵    at [...]"
[15:59:35] <nesoi> hmm... still can't figure out how to stop this click event from propagating down from a dialog to the listview that's under it
[15:59:52] <nesoi> can I debounce it somehow?
[16:01:02] <garciawebdev> sorry, no, this is strange
[16:01:48] <tw2113> did someone say strange?
[16:01:58] <garciawebdev> i'm having the error because of doing this on Chrome's console: $($0) -- ($0 refers to element selected on the Elements panel) -- this should be working, i used this in the last days!
[16:02:00] <tw2113> <---strange
[16:11:58] <ragas> is there a plugin, or established technique, for listing blog entries as dropdown menu items?
[16:13:01] <ragas> oops, sorry, wrong ice
[16:32:29] <didiergm> nesoi I said earlier I would report back in converting from 1.2 to 1.3. Biggest issue I had was some werid markup behavior as I need to move an input field on top of a canvas. I had to tell JQM to leave those fields alone (data-role=none) and apply the markup myself (ui-corner-all etc....)  Otherwise JQM 1.3 adds a new div to deal with background on inpt. This new div does not follow the individual markup (weird I admit like position
[16:32:29] <didiergm> relative and top negative)
[16:33:05] <didiergm> nesoi I see you have an issue with clicking; I immagine you tried a stopImmediatePropagation
[16:46:01] <nesoi> didiergm : I tried stopPropagation, but not immediate... the simpledialog2 has those calls in it though. What finally seems to have worked was a nasty kludge: I set a global flag when I'm in the middle of processing the event, and when I'm done I set a timeout on a function which resets the flag 250ms later.
[16:46:07] <nesoi> I wonder if I could do something cleaner
[16:47:21] <didiergm> nesoi is your dialog a child/sibling somehow of the field below ?
[16:49:06] <nesoi> didiergm : it shouldn't be... I had it be a sibling of the enclosing div
[16:49:23] <nesoi> so it's like <div><ul><li> and the popup is the sibling of the <div>
[16:49:54] <didiergm> nesoi and what is the element receiving the click ?
[16:50:06] <lorfds> I'm trying to hack on this file upload plugin
[16:50:06] <lorfds> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/test/index.html
[16:50:28] <lorfds> however, when i try to set breakpoints inside the template file shown on the page for the file download listing, nothing happens
[16:50:32] <lorfds> this is true in firebug and chrome
[16:50:48] <nesoi> didiergm : a button created by simpledialog2. but the click was also being received by the <li> directly under the button
[16:50:50] <lorfds> any ideas how to set breakpoints inside those js display templates?
[16:52:58] <didiergm> nesoi how is the click event attached to the button in SimpleDialog2 ?
[16:53:09] <didiergm> what is the exact syntax ?
[16:54:22] <nesoi> didiergm : http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/button.html
[16:56:31] <didiergm> Nesoi I meant inside the plugin - I am asking because if it is via live or delegate you cannot stop the propagation as by the time you get the event it is too late : it has already been propagated  http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/ see 'additional note'
[16:56:47] <nesoi> I don't know if there is some odd conflict going on because the listview which is below the popup is managed by jquery scrollz
[16:56:48] <nesoi> https://github.com/zippy1978/jquery.scrollz
[16:56:59] <nesoi> didiergm : I haven't looked at the plugin in detail
[16:58:57] <nesoi> didiergm : would it help to do this in my callback?: dialog_buttons['Cancel'].tap = function (ev){ev.stopImmediatePropagation();
[16:59:07] <didiergm> nesoi: try to add a return false at the end of your click handler & see what happens
[16:59:24] <didiergm> or what you suggest too
[17:03:47] <nesoi> didiergm : I had return false things didn't work as a result
[17:12:10] <didiergm> nesoi: Nasty! I have a feeling you could got to your <li> and play with the click event target (or original target, I can't remember the exact name I am sorry it 2 am here and I have been working since 9am yesterday so it all  ab it blurry) and ignore the click if the originator is not the same a the LI
[17:12:36] <nesoi> ah, that's interesting.... how can you tell who originated the click?
[17:14:45] <tubbo> event.currentTarget
[17:14:50] <tubbo> nesoi: ^^
[17:15:44] <tubbo> pretty sure $(this) is always what you put in the $('selector') but event.currentTarget gets you the DOM object of whatever one element you're on
[17:15:49] <tubbo> well, whatever it's responding to that is
[17:16:02] <nesoi> thanks tubbo...
[17:16:11] <tubbo> and you can make $(this) equivilant to event.currentTarget by doing $(event.currentTarget)
[17:17:29] <nesoi> hmm... I still am not sure how that would help without some kludgy global to say that we're in the middle of dealing with a popup, though.
[17:21:14] <didiergm> nesoi: look at the event numerous fields; one will give you the current dom object and another one will tell the original dom element; simply comparing the two should let you know whenther it was a direct click or a "bubbling" one
[17:21:47] <didiergm> so you would not need a kludge
[17:23:01] <didiergm> juqt place  a stop on your debugger on the li click event and all shall be revealed :)
[17:25:07] <nesoi> hm. unfortunately this is a phone app and it won't run except on the phone, for which there is no debugger :(
[17:27:42] <nesoi> it appears that the underlying li gets an event immediately after the dialog does... so the same finger tap may just be triggering 2 events
[17:28:25] <nesoi> thanks... ttyl! I have to run
[17:49:12] <tdignan> If I don't use clone on my draggable in jquery UI, the draggable appears far northwest of the mouse cursor.
[17:49:16] <tdignan> any way to adjust that?
[17:49:29] <tdignan> it seems using the "clone" feature is tripping me up on other things, so I'd prefer not to use it.
[17:53:03] <tdignan> nm, what I really needed was not only "connectToSortable" but also "connectWith" on the sortables themselves.
[17:53:15] <tdignan> without connectWith, things still work, just very poorly.
[18:43:29] <tdignan> It is occuring to me that jquery.hide() not only makes an element invisible, but also removes it's structure from the DOM as well.. as in, it no longer takes up any space.
[18:43:35] <tdignan> is there a convenient way to hide, but not lose the spacing?
[18:44:35] <tdignan> apparently the CSS I want is 'visibility: hidden'
[18:45:14] <tdignan> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9614665/615740  :)
[19:23:06] <zfly9> Hey guys this is prob very simple but what would I use if I wanted a parent element to take on a class if it's child has a certain class?
[19:23:28] <zfly9> $('.top').parent('div').addClass('top-wrap'); isn't working
[19:26:05] <coldhead> zfly9: $('div:has(>.top)').addClass('top-wrap')
[19:26:31] <coldhead> the > is to select the immediate child, in case you have nested dvs
[19:26:37] <coldhead> but you might not need that
[19:27:24] <zfly9> thanks yeah it's just a table wrapped in a div, the table has classes but I want the div to have classes
[19:27:43] <zfly9> so $('table:has(.top)').addClass('top-wrap') ?
[19:28:34] <zfly9> hmm didn't take
[19:28:35] <coldhead> that should work!
[19:28:40] <coldhead> >: |
[19:30:29] <coldhead> zfly9: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gyhKE
[19:32:03] <zfly9> well its the table that already has the class, and I want the classless div that wraps it to take on a class
[19:33:09] <coldhead> zfly9: can you put the actual html you're using in codepen?
[19:33:16] <coldhead> then we can fix it fix it fix it
[19:33:20] <coldhead> toomuchcoffee
[19:34:01] <grafi> i dont see why $('.top').parent().addClass('top-wrap'); shouldnt be working
[19:35:28] <coldhead> don't use .parent()
[19:35:32] <coldhead> it only goes up one level
[19:35:39] <coldhead> .closest('div')
[19:35:44] <coldhead> will go up until it finds a div
[19:35:51] <coldhead> that might be more what you want
[19:36:22] <grafi> well if the table has a class and the div is around the table ... do we need anything more than one level up?
[19:36:42] <coldhead> parent() is too fragile
[19:36:50] <coldhead> what if some wiseguy adds an intervening element later
[19:36:53] <coldhead> then everything breaks :(
[19:36:58] <grafi> well
[19:37:07] <coldhead> don't "well" me, young lady
[19:37:14] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[19:37:20] <coldhead> clearly we should do whatever i say
[19:37:23] <grafi> lady
[19:37:26] <grafi> haha
[19:38:33] * grafi is actually of the male persuasion
[19:38:50] <coldhead> aren't we all
[19:39:00] <grafi> unless we're not
[19:39:03] <grafi> i suppose
[19:39:51] <grafi> hm i've lost 2 days watching mojang make games ._.
[19:39:55] <grafi> oh oh
[19:41:31] <naeluh> there is no women on the internet
[19:42:03] <coldhead> well can you blame them
[19:42:40] <grafi> i just did
[19:42:40] <grafi> :P
[19:51:27] <someprimetime> o hi
[19:51:43] <coldhead> nice working with you, zfly9
[19:51:46] <coldhead> (jerk)
[19:55:04] <tw2113> behave coldhead :P
[20:48:00] <esas> When using .html to load content, is there any way of getting between the html being loaded, and all the external files (defined in the content) being loaded? .html only returns after it has changed the html and loaded the scripts
[20:48:54] <naeluh> hi everyone !!!
[20:49:32] <esas> and I would like to fire some functions right after the html is visible to the user, but before the script files have been loaded (because if takes a couple of seconds to load them) and the content looks really ugly without the script files magic
[21:26:24] <coaster> hi all
[21:26:51] <coaster> trying to set up a script to automatically select a choice of a dropdown
[21:27:03] <coaster> and I can use .trigger
[21:27:17] <coaster> to get the dropdown to drop, and to select the option I chose
[21:27:25] <coaster> but not all together
[21:27:40] <coaster> is there something about mouse events that would prevent this?
[21:27:44] <coaster> for example:
[21:28:04] <coaster> $(elem1).trigger('mousedown'); //Opens dropdown
[21:28:24] <coaster> $(elem2).trigger('mouseup'); //Chooses option
[21:28:46] <coaster> i can do these one after the other if I type them
[21:29:06] <coaster> but if i try to past that in to console and run it it does nothing
[21:33:06] <beachandbytes> do you have jquery loaded?
[21:33:29] <beachandbytes> nm ii read up
[21:35:27] <coaster> more info:
[21:35:46] <coaster> it works, but only AFTER I manually click the dropdown box open and closed with my mouse
[21:35:51] <coaster> than when I run that code it works
[21:36:37] <beachandbytes> in debugging are your trigger calls getting to the functions?
[21:37:23] <coaster> im not really sure, just kinda hacking about
[21:37:49] <coaster> I know the triggers work, but only after i click the dropbox open and closed
[21:37:50] <coaster> once
[21:38:05] <coaster> then if i run the code it does what it is supposed to
[21:38:09] <beachandbytes> set a breakpoint in the function and just use the trigger in main
[21:38:12] <beachandbytes> to see if its working
[21:39:53] <coaster> they are
[21:40:21] <coaster> but the only way i can get the expected outcome is to manually click the dropdown open and closed one time before running the function
[21:52:35] <quazimodo> hi guys
[21:53:11] <quazimodo> does anyone here Who knows such things, believe that images can be resized/scaled using javascript ?
[21:57:18] <quazimodo> ignore me, i stumbled across jquery-file-upload which seems to have resize capabilities
[21:57:21] <quazimodo> XD
[22:01:33] <beachandbytes> quazimodo do you mean compressing or just resizing?
[22:05:14] <avinashrbhat> quazimodo: is it using pure javascript? can you give me the link if it is
[22:08:44] <quazimodo> avinashrbhat: no it uses canvas :)
[22:09:22] <quazimodo> though, I'm surprised that you can't merely take a file with javascript, apply a resize/compression algo on it's binary form and then store that in a variable or memeory location
[22:09:47] <teqniq> @cork: r u here ?
[22:09:49] <beachandbytes> compressing a binary is different then resizing an image
[22:09:50] <quazimodo> beachandbytes: resize. Though, if it compressed for transmission it'd be great
[22:10:10] <quazimodo> beachandbytes: well ideally it'll resize (scale) then compress for transmission
[22:10:36] <quazimodo> even if js isn't the best place to do that, im surprised if you can't
[22:10:45] <owen1> i make a simple ajax call, i see it in red on the FF console (returned 200). but it never reached the success callback. any ideas?
[22:11:52] <beachandbytes> what is the response
[22:11:53] <beachandbytes> ?
[22:12:05] <beachandbytes> quazimodo im sure there are libraries try stackoverflow
[22:12:17] <teqniq> can anyone check my code? http://jsbin.com/welcome/1/edit
[22:12:30] <owen1> http://hastebin.com/meduhecoka.vbs
[22:12:33] <quazimodo> beachandbytes: interestingly, jszip exists which is pretty cool. I'll have to see how i can get jquery-fileupload to grab all the files, resize them, then send them to jszip for transmission
[22:12:36] <owen1> beachandbytes: are u asking me?
[22:12:59] <quazimodo> I wonder how facebook accepts lots of photos
[22:14:02] <beachandbytes> owen1 yes
[22:14:11] <beachandbytes> what is in the response to the request?
[22:15:11] <owen1> beachandbytes: i don't know (: can't find response in the 'net' section
[22:15:14] <beachandbytes> there are many reasons a 200 response can not reach the callback
[22:15:24] <owen1> oh
[22:15:28] <beachandbytes> if you post the request/response from fiddler
[22:15:30] <beachandbytes> i can tell you why
[22:15:39] <owen1> fiddler is down
[22:15:55] <owen1> and i don't see the response section in firebug
[22:16:02] <beachandbytes> why is fiddler down?
[22:16:14] <beachandbytes> can always use wireshark i guess
[22:16:28] <beachandbytes> what is the content type of the request/response?
[22:16:58] <owen1> beachandbytes: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[22:17:01] <owen1> Date: Sat, 23 Feb 2013 06:08:26 GMT
[22:17:03] <owen1> Connection: keep-alive
[22:17:04] <owen1> Transfer-Encoding: chunked
[22:17:25] <owen1> it's a simple get request to my node server. localhost
[22:17:37] <teqniq> soory, for the wrong link.check diz plz: http://jsbin.com/imihub/1/
[22:17:41] <owen1> i am sending chunks of data back to the client
[22:18:33] <beachandbytes> i would need to see more code for chunked
[22:18:43] <beachandbytes> what are you using to make the request?
[22:19:00] <owen1> beachandbytes: this is 'request header's
[22:19:15] <owen1> sorry, it was the response headers
[22:20:25] <owen1> beachandbytes: i don't know where is the response body.
[22:22:00] <beachandbytes> are you calling this from $.ajax?
[22:22:41] <owen1> beachandbytes: yeah
[22:22:56] <owen1> beachandbytes: is it better to use get instead?
[22:23:18] <owen1> jQuery.get()
[22:23:26] <beachandbytes> i think you will need plugin to handle chunked responses
[22:23:46] <owen1> beachandbytes: interesting!
[22:25:56] <beachandbytes> this might be relevant
[22:25:57] <beachandbytes> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10753725/jquery-support-transfer-encodingchunked-how
[22:26:57] <owen1> beachandbytes: it's interesting since my server is node. and chunked encoding is the defaullt
[22:28:27] <owen1> beachandbytes: i am surprised that i never see any response. i should at least see one response at the end of the request.
[22:29:53] <beachandbytes> do you mean in jquery or in wireshark/fiddler?
[22:30:11] <coaster> how can i get a function to run on a certain page load?
[22:30:20] <coaster> like if my browser goes to somesite.com
[22:30:27] <coaster> a script would run on load
[22:30:51] <beachandbytes> you could edit the host file and redirect from a local site
[22:31:00] <beachandbytes> or write browser plugin
[22:32:00] <owen1> beachandbytes: in jquery.
[22:32:43] <esas> is <script> tags anywhere 100% legal? well, not anywhere, but anywhere inside a head or body element
[22:32:55] <owen1> beachandbytes: my understanding of the way ajax works is it suppose to buffer all the chunks, and at the end of the request, i should see the callback.
[22:33:04] <esas> I know it works on every browser, but is it following to spec?
[22:33:27] <owen1> beachandbytes: in my case, my callback was never called
[22:33:36] <beachandbytes> owen1 if you read that post on so, you'll see why that is not true
[22:34:08] <owen1> "query ajax will call the success callback function only when connection terminates"
[22:35:48] <owen1> beachandbytes: connection termintates as soon as my server calls res.end(), i believe. but still, no callback.
