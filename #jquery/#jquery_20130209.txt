[00:00:05] <dblosevn> and quit firing the orientation change before the page is loaded
[00:00:33] <nesoi> I'm doing all this in onDeviceReady
[00:00:36] <dblosevn> really quit firing it at all
[00:00:46] <nesoi> how do I get it to display the 1st time then?
[00:00:52] <dblosevn> let the device fire its own events
[00:01:06] <dblosevn> replace you bind statement with the one i gave you
[00:01:15] <nesoi> right, but how do I get it to reset the margins on 1st display?
[00:01:29] <dblosevn> well the 1st display will fire pageshow
[00:01:38] <dblosevn> which happens to be one of the events im listening to
[00:01:54] <nesoi> it's doing the same thing as b4... no footer visible at first, turned to portrait, no footer, turned to landscape, footer in the middle of the page
[00:02:14] <dblosevn> are you using .on?
[00:02:20] <nesoi> yeah
[00:02:33] <dblosevn> weird
[00:03:00] <dblosevn> ?g jquerymobile events
[00:03:01] <b-ot> dblosevn: jQuery Mobile Docs - Events → http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[00:03:02] <bot-t> dblosevn, jQuery Mobile Docs - Events - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[00:04:54] <nesoi> if I just execute the code (no function or "on") it works ok
[00:05:18] <dblosevn> ya if its the only page loaded in the app
[00:05:30] <dblosevn> im assuming this isnt your app entry point
[00:05:40] <nesoi> it is now, but won't be in the future
[00:05:49] <dblosevn> ya so thats not a solution
[00:06:11] <nesoi> also for somew odd reason, having the "on" function also messed up my keyup and keydown events
[00:06:29] <nesoi> my search wasn't working right but as soon as I took out that on function it is again
[00:06:32] <nesoi> no other changes!
[00:07:09] <dblosevn> maybe i got the syntax wrong but im pretty sure it was right
[00:07:21] <nesoi> hmmmm
[00:07:58] <nesoi> so you can have multiple events on "on" by just putting them in a string separated by spaces?
[00:08:54] <dblosevn> ya
[00:09:13] <dblosevn> with the same listener
[00:09:23] <dblosevn> *the same callback
[00:09:39] <nesoi> hmm... those events aren't in this list http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[00:09:56] <dblosevn> um .... ya they are lol
[00:10:07] <nesoi> oh oops
[00:10:19] <dblosevn> pageshow
[00:10:20] <dblosevn> Triggered on the "toPage" after the transition animation has completed.
[00:10:22] <nesoi> heh, I know
[00:10:25] <nesoi> $.mobile.orientationChangeEnabled =
[00:10:30] <nesoi> "false";
[00:10:32] <nesoi> problem solved!
[00:10:49] <dblosevn> um, lol
[00:10:59] <nesoi> you know, for now
[00:11:58] <nesoi> hmm... seems deprecated? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5213
[00:11:59] <b-ot> nesoi: Issue #5213 by jkane001 (3mon 2w 3d 9h 28m 30s): orientationChangeEnabled appears to be deprecated, but docs still reference it
[00:12:00] <dblosevn> gah ive got so much work and so little time to do it
[00:12:12] <nesoi> oops!
[00:12:42] <nesoi> thanks for your help dblosevn! before you go one last question if it's !$.event.special.orientationchange.disabled how do I set that?
[00:13:13] <dblosevn> read the second comment
[00:13:29] <dblosevn> it doesnt appear to have been depreciated intentionally
[00:13:46] <nesoi> so just $.mobile.orientationChangeEnabled = "true"; in my onDeviceReady?
[00:14:13] <nesoi> I mean false :)
[00:14:14] <dblosevn> ya is that working for you?
[00:14:29] <dblosevn> ym true
[00:14:54] <dblosevn> and no quotes
[00:15:07] <nesoi> oh
[00:15:10] <dblosevn> $.mobile.orientationChangeEnabled = true;
[00:15:30] <dblosevn> true is not the same as "true"
[00:15:47] <nesoi> I set it to false, and it didn't stop it
[00:16:11] <dblosevn> when its set to true though you get the desired behavior?
[00:16:51] <dblosevn> false doesnt mean it stops the orientation event from being fired it simply means it binds to resize instead
[00:17:03] <nesoi> ah
[00:17:27] <dblosevn> Note that we currently bind to the resize event when orientationchange is not natively supported, or when $.mobile.orientationChangeEnabled is set to false.
[00:17:54] <nesoi> hm
[00:18:13] <nesoi> oh well, I guess this is a problem for tomorrow
[00:18:44] <dblosevn> lol, ive got to slam throguh the weekend no sleep for me i fly back home on monday and i have to have a finished product before i do
[00:18:50] <nesoi> whoa!
[00:18:53] <nesoi> can you do it??
[00:18:57] <dblosevn> no lol
[00:19:03] <nesoi> yeah, no sleep sounds tuff
[00:19:18] <dblosevn> and my other dev has been out of touch for days so im doing all the work
[00:19:30] <nesoi> I hope he/she's ok
[00:19:35] <nesoi> what's the project?
[00:19:43] <dblosevn> ya hes a lead dev for reality kings
[00:19:52] <dblosevn> and they slammed him this week
[00:20:19] <nesoi> oh you're doing porn sites?
[00:20:39] <dblosevn> no he is lol
[00:20:56] <dblosevn> see pm
[01:04:37] <drownzz> Heey, could someone explain me the difference between: $('box') and $("box") ?
[01:07:48] <dblosevn> drownzz: one uses ' the other uses " there is no difference to the javascript engine
[01:08:09] <drownzz> dblosevn okay so I could use both ?
[01:08:28] <dblosevn> I generally try to use one or the other consistantly
[01:09:32] <dblosevn> the only time i would change it up is if i normally use ' which i do by the way and I had to make a literal with a ' in it such as 'hi whats\'s up' I would write it "Hi What's up" to save myself from having to escape the '
[01:09:59] <drownzz> Okay but it shouldn't make any differnce though
[01:11:24] <dblosevn> in php there is a difference however, $var = 1; echo "$var"; would interpolate $var and echo 1; however echo '$var'; would echo $var to the screen so dont take this knowedge about js to heart with other languages as ' and " deifnitely have idffernt meanings in some languages
[01:12:08] <drownzz> Okay thank in advance, helped me alot of brainwashing :P
[01:12:51] <dblosevn> :-) brainwashing++
[01:17:48] <Whirl3d> If I create an html element in jquery using : var el=$(htmlstring); el.appendTo("body");  and inside the htmlstring is sometihng like:"<?php wp_getheader() ?>";   along with some other html, will the php call get evaluated?
[01:18:11] <dblosevn> not at all
[01:18:16] <dblosevn> js cant eval php
[01:18:35] <dblosevn> it will be interpreted as an invliad tag and ignored by the browser
[01:18:44] <Whirl3d> Right, I was hoping that by adding it to the dom, the browser would interpret it
[01:19:01] <dblosevn> how could the browser possibly interpret php?
[01:19:42] <dblosevn> php code is evaluated on the server, not the browser
[01:19:48] <booom> hey oh dudesss
[01:19:49] <booom> http://pastebin.com/zk3tD0ri
[01:19:49] <Whirl3d> Somebody needs to come up with a better solution that js or php
[01:20:00] <dblosevn> you need to eval it on the server before sending it to the browser via ajax
[01:20:06] <booom> i'm trying resetting initial css statment is this correct ? http://pastebin.com/zk3tD0ri
[01:20:22] <booom> mouseover and it changes mouseout and it rest the css initial rules ...
[01:20:31] <dblosevn> its not a short coming of js its like that with any language client vs server
[01:20:46] <Whirl3d> that needs to change LOL
[01:20:54] <dblosevn> lol
[01:21:31] <dblosevn> thats like me trying to pull a database query on the server form js
[01:21:33] <Whirl3d> I have an obnoxiously image heavy layout that I don't want to reload eery time someone clicks a link in WP
[01:21:42] <dblosevn> no need to reload
[01:22:00] <dblosevn> just send the parsed data in your ajax response
[01:22:05] <Whirl3d> So I guess I will ajax the html chunks
[01:22:12] <dblosevn> oh
[01:22:15] <dblosevn> this isnt ajax
[01:22:52] <dblosevn> if its not just render the html on the server side into whatever method your using to buffer it
[01:22:52] <Whirl3d> It's ugly that php can embed js in the page, but not the other way around
[01:23:14] <dblosevn> php cant "embed" js on the page
[01:23:36] <dblosevn> php does not evaluate the js that you have the ability to generate
[01:23:39] <Whirl3d> lol, not js itself
[01:23:54] <dblosevn> it simply renders the js for the javascript engine to interpret
[01:24:22] <Whirl3d> I know, I wish I could more easily render the php for the server to interpret
[01:24:27] <Whirl3d> I know AJAX
[01:24:30] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:24:34] <dblosevn> you could write js that generated php code for the server to interpret on the request
[01:24:37] <dblosevn> same logic there
[01:24:45] <dblosevn> although id highly advise to never do that
[01:24:58] <Whirl3d> Just a second ago you said I couldn't do that?
[01:25:08] <Whirl3d> And why? I believe you but why?
[01:25:15] <dblosevn> um
[01:25:18] <dblosevn> i didnt say that
[01:25:31] <dblosevn> i said javascript cant evaulate php and vise versa
[01:26:01] <dblosevn> you can generate js on the server to be evaluated by javascript in the browser
[01:26:52] <dblosevn> you can also generate php code in js to be evaluated by the server on a request
[01:27:15] <dblosevn> neither one is capable of evaluating the other
[01:27:22] <dblosevn> js evals js php evals php
[01:28:13] <dblosevn> and my statement still stands you should never eval php code thats sent to the server via the browser
[01:28:40] <Whirl3d> I need to understand when what is happening when a page loads. Because from my twisted perspective, it's all text and the server gets called to eval anything in <php>-ish tags and JS in the browser intereprets anything in the <script> tags---loosely. So Where could I find out better about what order these things are interepreted
[01:28:53] <Whirl3d> I don't even know how to ask the question...
[01:28:57] <dblosevn> ok
[01:29:18] <dblosevn> php generates the html for the browser to interpret
[01:29:38] <dblosevn> this html has already been parsed by php and php should no longer be required to display the page
[01:29:40] <Whirl3d> So the end user nevers sees the php tags?
[01:29:45] <dblosevn> no
[01:29:49] <dblosevn> they shouldnt
[01:29:55] <Whirl3d> k
[01:30:01] <dblosevn> its text/html when the browser sees it
[01:30:12] <Whirl3d> and this only happens once. At the very beginning before the browser gets it
[01:30:15] <dblosevn> the browser takes that text and builds the dom
[01:30:30] <dblosevn> if the dom happens to have js in it the js is evaluated
[01:31:22] <dblosevn> yes when you pull a request to http://domain.com/page.php all the browser gets back is prerendered html from the webserver
[01:31:23] <Whirl3d> So I had planned to use jquery BBQ to cpature the WP links and translate them in to parseable ajax calls to get the data. I should get it in html pages?
[01:31:50] <dblosevn> i have no clue what your really trying to accomplish
[01:32:21] <Whirl3d> Right now, when you have a link in a nav menu, it has the WP query encoded in it..
[01:32:32] <Whirl3d> Jquery BBQ can intercept that before the browser sends the request
[01:32:40] <Whirl3d> stopping the page from loading
[01:32:44] <Whirl3d> parse the url
[01:32:51] <Whirl3d> request the same content via ajax
[01:33:00] <Whirl3d> modify the result and add it to the dom
[01:33:14] <Whirl3d> no page refresh
[01:34:11] <dblosevn> ok
[01:34:25] <dblosevn> and by wp query i assume the url to the page in wp
[01:34:33] <Whirl3d> So do I rewrite the php template files to generate the markup correctly or do I handle that in jquery and just have the ajax return the raw post data in json format
[01:35:08] <dblosevn> youd have to modify the template
[01:35:38] <dblosevn> make sure jquerybbq identifys itself so you can return the content without the header/footer etc
[01:36:04] <dblosevn> you want to still display the whole template if it wasnt requested with ajax
[01:36:36] <dblosevn> ie user has js disabled, syntax error in a js file etc
[01:36:54] <dblosevn> that way it will still be able to regress back to a standard request
[01:37:56] <Whirl3d> I am a firm believer that if you have JS disabled, you are used to an ugly web and my site is not for ugly web viewers.
[01:37:59] <dblosevn> booom: that looks good to me
[01:38:15] <Whirl3d> Take it or leave it. JS or nothing.
[01:38:57] <booom> @dblosevn man is there anyway to bind then stop and rebind with on?
[01:39:10] <dblosevn> Whirl3d: lol being your site works just fine with normal requests, i would add the ability to request the content with ajax and not take away the functionality thats already there
[01:39:13] <Whirl3d> Yeah I talk a good story after being up for 40 hours, but come monday when I have to deliver this, It'll all work without js. bah
[01:39:22] <booom> http://pastebin.com/JEzGBfae
[01:39:34] <booom> check i'm tryng unbinding then rebinding
[01:39:50] <booom> but when i call off() then i' not able to bind once more
[01:39:55] <booom> dblosevn:
[01:40:13] <Whirl3d> Oh, I forgot to mention that we are completely scrapping the current theme and our new theme I am having to write from scratch using _s.
[01:40:53] <dblosevn> booom: i think you misunderstand what on and off do
[01:41:14] <booom> yep fixed sorry )
[01:41:17] <booom> false alert :D
[01:41:18] <dblosevn> $(this).off() will remove all event listeners for this
[01:41:37] <dblosevn> $(this).on() does absolutely nothing
[01:42:25] <dblosevn> you also should by using on instead of bind
[01:42:57] <dblosevn> if i were you i would use .hover
[01:43:07] <dblosevn> ?.hover @ booom
[01:43:32] <booom> uhm don't mind the main problem i'm binding mouseover on a gmap
[01:43:40] <booom> so it blinks on mouseover binded
[01:43:48] <booom> cause of layers i think
[01:44:34] <dblosevn> booom: http://pastebin.com/j2cVEUvM
[01:45:29] <booom> sounds really better )
[01:45:35] <booom> i'll use your sintax
[01:45:45] <booom> but now i need to fix the problem of blinking :D
[01:45:48] <booom> thanks a lot
[01:46:00] <dblosevn> that should fix the blinking
[01:47:31] <booom> oh ok i try now
[01:49:02] <booom> damn nope it blinks anyway
[01:49:08] <booom> need to find another solution
[01:49:13] <booom> cause i'm trying this check :
[01:49:33] <booom> http://pastebin.com/yDS5eNSJ
[01:50:00] <booom> on over position:absolute; top and left so the element comes up bigger
[01:50:07] <booom> then repositionate the element
[01:50:49] <booom> but it blinks on mouseover and it shows the element with new class not in same original position
[01:51:30] <booom> (forget the double addClass my mistake)
[01:51:34] <booom> dblosevn:
[01:52:03] <booom> i tryed also with css trsnform:scale(1.2) but it is not good
[01:52:20] <booom> the element change position and the map is not scaled but skratched
[01:56:19] <dblosevn> the blick is being caused by the fadeIn
[01:57:55] <dblosevn> do $(this).addClass('media-square-map-hover').css({'top':_top,'left':_left}).show(); instead and see if the blink is resolved
[02:20:58] <Whirl3d> booom, where's the markup that goes with this?
[03:25:01] <margle> I've got an element that's resized in a css transition animation; I want to scroll to said element, but obviously the shifting width of the element moves the scroll target
[03:25:15] <margle> any ideas on how to "update" or follow the scroll target before I invoke the scroll to?
[03:41:23] <margle> basically I need to get the tween results
[03:41:26] <margle> before the occur
[03:51:22] <dblosevn> not sure when your using a css transition if you were doing it with .animate you could adjast in the tick callback
[03:51:30] <dblosevn> *adjust
[03:52:37] <dblosevn> being javascript isnt involved at all you would have to figure out the math the tranistion is using for the tween
[03:52:54] <dblosevn> and even then it would probally be out of sync
[03:53:21] <dblosevn> being theres 2 timers involved the css timer and the js timer
[03:54:22] <dblosevn> the only plus on your side is the css timer is in a seperate thread from the js timer so they could theroretically tick at the same time
[03:55:32] <dblosevn> myself personally i would calculate where the element is going to end up and scrollTo there
[04:45:34] <crised> Hello, Which is a very hot galleria image display made with jquery? I want to display thumbnails, then on a click I would like to see all images in full res.
[05:13:43] <dblosevn> i like fancybox for that super simple to configure
[05:21:06] <Shizen> recursion saved the day~
[05:39:26] <crised> dblosevn: I think I'll go for galleria.io because it handles different resolution images easily
[05:40:36] <dblosevn> kk, ill check that out fancybox always seemd to change its size based on the res of the fullsize images for me though
[05:51:24] <jita> How can i circumvent this http://dpaste.org/6BwDO/ ?

[06:35:39] <rabbi1> if $(
[06:37:31] <rabbi1> if $('input[name="elementname"]').jqfunction(); ... how can i get the parent element of 'elementname' which is calling jqfunction (having know the jqfunction ) ?
[06:40:18] <pachet> rabbi1: .parent()? not quite sure what you mean
[06:40:22] <pachet> ?.parent()
[06:40:23] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[06:41:39] <rabbi1> pachet: parent() element is fine... but i need to select the element which has triggered particular function....
[06:42:49] <bambu> Is this understanding correct:  On each keypress send ajax data saying "person is typing."
[06:43:08] <rabbi1> e.g. $('#tabs').tabs();  so i want to select '#tabs' (unknown) but what i know is the function 'tabs()' .... so with only 'tabs()' i need to know which are the elements called this 'tabs()' function
[06:43:11] <bambu> For a chat that tells you when the other side is typing?
[06:43:18] <bambu> Is that how they do this?
[06:43:18] <pachet> bambu: no, throttle it
[06:43:24] <bambu> I was thinking...
[06:43:28] <bambu> Each keypress is alot.
[06:43:31] <bambu> ty
[06:43:43] <pachet> have a timer
[06:43:54] <pachet> that basically checks whether they're still typing
[06:43:58] <pachet> each keypress, reset the timer
[06:45:41] <pachet> rabbi1: um, assuming $.fn.tabs is a good little plugin and returns the context for chaining purposes... dont you have that already?
[06:45:56] <pachet> $('#tabs').tabs().attr('id') => 'tabs'
[06:46:48] <rabbi1> pachet: perfect, in your above example say i don't know ('#tabs').. then ?
[06:46:49] <bambu> What abot seen? pachet
[06:46:56] <bambu> Do they detect unfocus, and focus?
[06:47:08] <bambu> Thats pretty intelligent coding :p
[06:47:31] <pachet> bambu: what is seen?
[06:47:43] <rabbi1> i may be putting it wrong ..... I just want to select the element which has called the tabs() function ...... that's it.
[06:48:06] <pachet> assuming whoever wrote the plugin knows their ass from their elbow, you have it
[06:48:15] <pachet> it's returned from .tabs(), or .whateverplugin()
[06:48:31] <pachet> i mean, it may be multiple elements
[06:48:55] <rabbi1> pachet: yeah, may be mutiple elements, never came across this at all .....
[06:49:44] <rabbi1> let me dig the api
[06:50:32] <bambu> pachet:   Message seen at 8:00
[06:51:08] <pachet> oh
[06:51:12] <rabbi1> i am not referring to tabs(), its just an example
[06:51:39] <pachet> yeah they just keep track of all the unseen messages, and whenever you come back from away they walk that list and send out the appropriate notifications
[06:52:02] <pachet> but yeah it's usually on application focus, or tab activation, what have you
[06:53:19] <rabbi1> confusing, i don think i got what i am looking for... web search also resulting in wrong results .:(
[06:55:47] <pachet> rabbi1: i wouldn't build a whole app around knowing this, but you even get the selector back as a property on the jq result that is passed through the chain
[06:55:58] <pachet> so $('#foo').somePlugin().selector => '#foo'
[06:56:23] <masentinel900> var infoData = $(this).parent().text();, Like this takes all the values of are inside of <li> tag.
[06:57:10] <masentinel900> I just need that takes the text() value of <li> and not inside like <ul> and that
[06:58:11] <rabbi1> pachet: ok, i have 10 input elements with same class name and i have called some jquery plugin/function for those ten elements. I have to select those elements without knowing there class name and with the function to which it has called ....
[06:58:43] <vedic> Hi I have have a jquery object of the form $.myObj = { ... } . In this object, I have array and string variables. I want to verify if they all are define (i.e. array should not be empty, string should not be empty string). How to do that?
[06:59:02] <Ziggy`> masentinel900: WHat do you need? What is the html structure?
[06:59:13] <rabbi1> pachet: so #foo is unknown and i can't use it to , i just have to select #foo with the use of .somePlugin(). so which is the element which is calling the .somePlugin() ?
[07:00:01] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/0PeUDQp8
[07:00:53] <rabbi1> masentinel900: please use jsfiddle
[07:01:44] <timbre> hi
[07:02:10] <dblosevn> Hey anybody know of a plugin that will auto expand the active text area so you can see everything thats in it and when it looses focus it goes back to normal?
[07:02:11] <Ziggy`> masentinel900: That html structure is not correct.
[07:02:31] <Ziggy`> You're missing an li in two places..
[07:02:51] <rabbi1> dblosevn: if you are coding in html5 then use transition
[07:03:00] <timbre> i'm currently plagued by the infamous "sum floats together" precision issue, ie summing 0.01 + 0.02 returns a gazillion decimals. In essence i need to sum this correctly. Research on StackOverflow lead me to BigDecimal.js , which is made in 2000 blabla. Is there something baked into JQ to sum floats without this issue?
[07:03:08] <vedic> Hi I have have a jquery object of the form $.myObj = {obj1:[], obj2: '', obj3: [1,2], ... } . In this object, I have array and string variables. I want to verify if they all are define (i.e. array should not be empty, string should not be empty string). How to do that?
[07:03:32] <dblosevn> rabbi1: hmm, ya its html5 never heard of that though, off to the docs lol
[07:03:42] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/W5wBm/1/
[07:03:44] <Ziggy`> masentinel900: And you shouldn't place <li> inside an <li>..
[07:04:07] <masentinel900> That script is ordered..
[07:04:09] <rabbi1> dblosevn: html5 and css3 has lots, only if you can't find there then can think of jquery....
[07:04:10] <Ziggy`> masentinel900: Fix the structure.
[07:04:14] <rabbi1> dblosevn: good luck
[07:04:16] <masentinel900> already..
[07:04:35] <Ziggy`> masentinel900: It's not fixed, you can see the "red" ul's on jsfiddle?
[07:05:19] <Ziggy`> You are missing a closing </li> on all child elements for one thing.
[07:06:10] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/W5wBm/2/
[07:06:18] <masentinel900> that is the last version
[07:06:51] <timbre> http://jsfiddle.net/zjhna/  << can anybody help me on this? is there a JQ way to solve this?
[07:06:58] <Ziggy`> masch: THe HTML structure is still wrong.
[07:07:19] <Ziggy`> Close your child <li>'s
[07:07:48] <Ziggy`> When that's fixed. I'll help you out.
[07:07:58] <timbre> Ziggy`: can you help me in the meanwhile ? :)
[07:08:21] <Ziggy`> timbre: Sure, what is it?
[07:08:31] <timbre> http://jsfiddle.net/zjhna/
[07:08:33] <timbre> this
[07:08:51] <timbre> does JQ provide a way to sum floats in a sane way?
[07:09:50] <Ziggy`> timbre: http://jsfiddle.net/zjhna/1/
[07:10:03] <timbre> still wrong here
[07:10:05] <Ziggy`> Pass in he radix
[07:10:08] <Ziggy`> oops, sorry, wait.
[07:11:08] <bambu> thanks
[07:11:24] <rabbi1> I am back with my problem, how can i select the unknown element which is calling a jquery function/plugin ?
[07:11:46] <crised> Which was a good practice to wrap a script? It was something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/6308565/1341526 (dealing with several scripts on one page)
[07:12:04] <timbre> thats good crised
[07:12:09] <timbre> personally i prefer AMD modules though
[07:12:09] <Ziggy`> timbre: http://jsfiddle.net/zjhna/2/
[07:12:25] <timbre> also wraps it in an ASEF
[07:12:28] <timbre> but in a different way
[07:12:38] <timbre> allows you to require in dependencies and stuff. quite powerful.
[07:12:45] <timbre> look at requirejs.org crised
[07:12:50] <Ziggy`> If you're gonna be working with 2 decimal points.
[07:12:52] <vedic> I have have a jquery object of the form $.myObj = {obj1:[], obj2: '', obj3: [1,2], ... } . In this object, I have array and string variables. I want to verify if they all are define (i.e. array should not be empty, string should not be empty string). How to do that?
[07:13:27] <timbre> Ziggy`: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/661562/how-to-format-a-float-in-javascript/661757#661757
[07:13:33] <timbre> i must use ie7, so this applies.
[07:13:38] <crised> timbre: I think I'll just use that approach, it's a very simple script that I pretend to write, in a possible complex envirometn
[07:13:58] <timbre> "that you pretend to write" < lol
[07:14:09] <timbre> btw, you can drop the leading ;
[07:14:25] <timbre> just do function($){}(Jquery)
[07:15:36] <timbre> anyhow this float issue is so much of a pain in the lower back that i'd have expected any toolkit/framwork to provide something in that respect
[07:15:43] <timbre> Ziggy`: do you know of anything?
[07:16:47] <timbre> something that has been battle tested :)
[07:17:15] <timbre> as much as i love SO/IRC nothing beats unit tests on all browsers :)
[07:18:18] <timbre> crised: anyhow, because you say "complex environment" i'd reccomend you considering using AMD
[07:18:23] <Ziggy`> timbre: Nah, have you tried the javascript channel since this not really jQuery related?
[07:18:31] <timbre> it keeps thing sane in the long run. a lot.
[07:18:37] <Ziggy`> timbre: I don't know the cross-browser solution.
[07:19:06] <timbre> Ziggy`: in ##js theyd just tell me to use what you suggested as well. i was hoping in a JQ specific solution
[07:20:03] <timbre> but i do appreciate the input :)
[07:23:50] <Ziggy`> timbre: I guess you could make your own function with similiraty to toFixed and test it out cross-browser wise.
[07:24:05] <timbre> thats what i'm doing right now
[07:24:06] <timbre> :)
[07:24:36] <Ziggy`> timbre: Does .toPrecision have issues in IE as well?
[07:25:00] <Ziggy`> var foo = 45.01 + 20.00; foo = foo.toPrecision(4); // 65.01
[07:25:30] <crised> guys, any idea on this error: http://pastebin.com/LYpbeWZ7
[07:26:37] <Ziggy`> crised: Don't know, I'm not familiar with JSf7primefaces
[07:26:40] <timbre> Ziggy`: a quick google search tells my gut that its somewhat plagued with bugs
[07:26:51] <timbre> i dont have my virtual machine on right now to test though
[07:27:42] <crised> Ziggy: the callback is being executed, maybe my function is not written correctly?
[07:28:02] <timbre> crised: shouldnt that be $.rewrite_number   ?
[07:28:31] <systemfault> timbre: Nah.. he added the function to the prototype..
[07:28:31] <crised> In HTML, it's written this: onblur="rewrite_number"
[07:28:46] <systemfault> timbre: So it needs to be called on a jquery object
[07:28:59] <crised> Then how do I call that funtion?
[07:29:06] <crised> or should I rewrite the function?
[07:29:09] <timbre> well hes trying to access it as a global var
[07:29:22] <timbre> which is exactly the issue: its not a global var
[07:29:32] <Ziggy`> He's using JSF/Primeface, we are not aware of what that does?
[07:29:43] <crised> timbre: I'm just trying to not interfere with other scripts
[07:29:46] <rabbi1> any help on this ?  how can i select the unknown element which is calling a jquery function/plugin ?
[07:30:08] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: Put up a fiddle, tell me the desired result.
[07:30:12] <timbre> crised: you shouldnt export it as a global var, dont get me wrong
[07:30:15] <timbre> i didnt say that :)
[07:30:24] <timbre> i just said thats how your accessing it. which is why it fails.
[07:30:31] <systemfault> crised: You stop using javascript inside your markup…  then you would write $('priceInput').on('blur', function() { $(this).rewrite_number(); });
[07:30:38] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: nothing to do with fiddle here, well will try to
[07:31:56] <systemfault> crised: Oops.. did a typo, $('#priceInput') instead of $('priceInput')
[07:32:06] <timbre> crised: also whatever systemfault just said. writing inline JS is as bad as using global vars. things just get unmanageable after a while. use on, and proper selectors, and discover bliss.
[07:32:08] <crised> now please check: simplified version of the error: http://pastebin.com/Ex9SWnNw
[07:32:43] <crised> timbre: Good point!
[07:33:17] <crised> So please guide me on how to call a function for this input element
[07:33:45] <systemfault> I written the full code..
[07:33:46] <timbre> point in case: separate LOGIC from MARKUP, just as you wouldnt write inline style declarations in HTML. hence: external JS is EXTERNAL for a reason (maintainability). always keep this in mind.
[07:34:00] <systemfault> $('#priceInput').on('blur', function() { $(this).rewrite_number(); });
[07:34:12] <systemfault> Now, if you don't get it, you're simply trolling.
[07:34:13] <crised> systemfault: I understand but How should I enclose that to make it safe?
[07:34:19] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: http://jsfiddle.net/TGAvm/ i need to select the element which is calling the datapicker();
[07:34:42] <systemfault> crised: You put that inside $(function() {    code here }); inside another .js file
[07:35:02] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: but i am unaware of the element or its id, classname or name which is calling it\
[07:35:05] <timbre> crised: its not a matter of safe, its a matter of "readable". you probably have a script tag around that contains a DOM ready event hook, and within that callback function you put that line.
[07:35:06] <crised> let me try
[07:35:54] <timbre> anyhow, i'm out
[07:35:58] <timbre> good luck!
[07:36:03] <crised> timbre: thanks man
[07:36:19] <timbre> thanks Ziggy` :)
[07:36:33] <Ziggy`> Np..
[07:36:58] <systemfault> crised: http://jsfiddle.net/skkqx/
[07:37:06] <crised> systemafault: is it $(function() {    code here });  as safe as: (function ($) {$.fn.hello = function (x) { code here };})(jQuery);
[07:37:27] <crised> not interfering with other JS files is my main concern
[07:37:38] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: hope u got my problem ...
[07:37:41] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: Hmm..
[07:37:44] <pachet> crised: they're different things
[07:37:55] <crised> pachet: PLease explain me thtat
[07:37:57] <pachet> the first one will be invoked when jquery determines the dom is manipulable
[07:38:01] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: Well yeah, but however I don't really get what you're trying to achieve.
[07:38:05] <systemfault> crised: Not the same thing, you can make it safer like this: http://jsfiddle.net/skkqx/1/
[07:38:14] <pachet> the second will be immediately invoked but won't break if someone overwrote $ on the global
[07:38:34] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: how can i find the element which is calling datapicker(); function .... that's it
[07:40:00] <crised> systemfault: So on the first block you define functions, then on the second block you trigger them? Is this a safe/enclosed approach?
[07:40:03] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: The element that called datepicker will have a classname of 'hasDatepicker'
[07:40:18] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: However, I don't get what you are doing.
[07:40:40] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: here i am unaware of the element's classname or any other property associated with that element
[07:40:51] <systemfault> crised: Yeah, the second block jQuery(function() {}); is like doing jQuery(document).ready(function() {});
[07:41:19] <crised> ok
[07:41:22] <crised> let me try it
[07:41:34] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: I'm sorry, but you need to be more clear on what you are trying to achieve.
[07:42:11] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: What do you need to do.
[07:42:23] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: ok, i need to change the classname from to "someexample" which is calling the datepicker();
[07:42:39] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: ok, i need to change the class name from 'classname' to "someexample" which is calling the datepicker();
[07:43:14] <crised> systemfault: on rewrite_number() my Ide complains about invalid number of parameters
[07:43:16] <rabbi1> find all <input> where <input> is calling .datepicker();
[07:43:34] <systemfault> crised: What?
[07:43:57] <systemfault> crised: Are you using it the same way you're seeing it on my example at jsfiddle.net?
[07:44:25] <crised> systemfault: 1 sec
[07:44:59] <crised> systemfault: nope because I had to change the id: $('#addAdForm:priceInput')
[07:46:21] <systemfault> crised: perhaps addAdForm:priceInput isn't an ID… or perhaps jquery doesn't like the usage of : inside an id (It might think it's a pseudo selector)
[07:46:52] <crised> systemfault: It is an id for sure, Maybe I need to escape it?
[07:47:06] <systemfault> crised: try it, I never used : in my ids
[07:47:17] <systemfault> crised: Perhaps the good old \ does it
[07:47:58] <crised> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: priceInput
[07:48:21] <systemfault> crised: For what I can read, you need to add two \ in front of the char to escape
[07:48:33] <systemfault> #addAdForm\\:priceInput
[07:48:42] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: Just seems like a hack -> http://jsfiddle.net/TGAvm/1/
[07:49:03] <crised> systemfault: great man thx, I was trying with only one \
[07:49:31] <systemfault> crised: I would also have tried a single \ as it's like that in most other languages..
[07:50:30] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: how did we get .hasDatepicker ?
[07:50:56] <rabbi1> ok, jquery will add it
[07:50:57] <Ziggy`> rabbi1: jQuery UI Datepicker set's that class on the element.
[07:51:08] <crised> system_fault: I want to rewrite a number, i.e. 1000 into $1.000  should I pass the value of the input field priceInput to the rewrite_number function?
[07:52:23] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: thanks a lot, give me a moment. .  :)
[07:54:56] <systemfault> crised: You should be able to access it from the function already
[07:55:29] <systemfault> crised: http://jsfiddle.net/skkqx/2/
[07:56:01] <crised> systemfault: ok, Now any ideas on how to rewrite numbers?
[08:02:27] <dblosevn> numvar.replace(/[0-9]+/, 'abc'); :-)
[08:03:17] <grafi> oO
[08:03:57] <grafi> numbers be gone
[08:04:12] <dblosevn> well not quite lol /g
[08:04:56] <grafi> true
[08:06:47] <rabbi1> Ziggy`: thanks dude.... got to make it work ... :)
[08:07:40] <crised> Does this code looks good? (works) http://pastebin.com/7GfBSd1e
[08:07:55] <crised> *I mean the code does works

[11:11:57] <gotwig> hello
[11:12:03] <gotwig> dblosevn, hey there
[11:12:20] <dblosevn> do i want to be lol
[11:12:21] <gotwig> dblosevn, I actually use now a mix between my normal contenteditable and jeditable. thx for the tipp
[11:12:35] <gotwig> dblosevn, but  I have a problem :D
[11:12:41] <dblosevn> i wish i could get ckeditor to work
[11:12:59] <gotwig> when you look here  http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[11:13:09] <gotwig> eh, e.g I want to have something like
[11:13:22] <gotwig> $_POST['id']
[11:13:28] <gotwig> and I want to specify the content
[11:13:37] <gotwig> I can do that with id: "CONTENT" right?
[11:13:50] <dblosevn> um
[11:13:51] <gotwig> I want something like that       justtheid: $('#gridname').data('actualgrid'),
[11:13:58] <gotwig> but that isn't that easy as I tought
[11:14:20] <gotwig> how can I specify an extra value, that does not get interpreted by anything, and just is in the actual _POST?
[11:14:45] <gotwig> the value should be got from jquery, you see...
[11:14:47] <dblosevn> easiest way is to add it to the query string lol but there is an option for that let me find it in the api
[11:15:38] <gotwig> when I now try to access justtheid
[11:15:42] <gotwig> its not available
[11:15:47] <gotwig> (via POST)
[11:18:00] <dblosevn> submitdata : function(value, settings) { return {fieldName: $(this).data('actualgrid')}
[11:18:06] <Armistice> Not sure if this is a jquery issue or a css issue or both. http://213.249.219.79/projects/JLT/index4.html if you click one of the bottoms in the middle, the quote at the bottom should slide down... in which it does, but it jumps a bit then slides down. How can I prevent it doing the little jump?
[11:18:11] <Armistice> buttons in the middle*
[11:18:43] <iKb> my html structure is this http://pastebin.com/R3k4rrr7 - how can i hide the fgroup if all the divs inside the fwrapper are hidden
[11:18:49] <gotwig> dblosevn, thats like ridicilous complex :D But I try it
[11:19:00] <dblosevn> gotwig: seriously
[11:19:16] <dblosevn> do you know the basics of the jquery api?
[11:19:19] <gotwig> dblosevn, so how can I access that thing?
[11:19:35] <gotwig> dblosevn, like $_POST['HM??'] ?
[11:19:43] <dblosevn> um
[11:19:47] <dblosevn> thats php
[11:20:00] <gotwig> what value is that xD
[11:20:06] <gotwig> or do I have to go to #php for that lol
[11:20:19] <gotwig> the name for the value.. not the actual value
[11:20:22] <dblosevn> lol, that wasnt my question
[11:20:35] <dblosevn> the key is in $_POST['id'] in the post
[11:20:42] <dblosevn> you can change that
[11:20:48] <gotwig> thx I try that
[11:20:49] <dblosevn> but by default it is id
[11:20:52] <gotwig> thank you really much
[11:21:08] <gotwig> mummy is going to be proud...
[11:21:47] <dblosevn> paste me an example of your jeditable config and the markup for your page or even better if you can create a fiddle it would be awesome
[11:22:45] <gotwig> I better make a past..
[11:22:55] <gotwig> just a past :X
[11:23:27] <gotwig> here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/1630436/
[11:23:31] <Armistice> http://213.249.219.79/projects/JLT/index4.html anyone know why the Quote does a little skip then slides down. It's the same as the profile biit at the top, but instead of top and marginTop it's bottom and marginBottom
[11:23:35] <Armistice> but it's the same values
[11:23:37] <Armistice> just a little odd
[11:23:42] <gotwig> currently I get something like unexpected string
[11:24:18] <dblosevn> gotwig: umm lol fieldName was implied you name the field
[11:24:28] <gotwig> omg...
[11:24:48] <gotwig> but that shouldn be the problem
[11:24:54] <gotwig> it says unexpected string
[11:25:36] <Armistice> unexpected string on what line?
[11:25:55] <gotwig> its away lol
[11:26:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/59
[11:26:30] <gotwig> I just put
[11:26:33] <gotwig> " around the function
[11:26:36] <dblosevn> you were missing a } and had a traialing comma
[11:26:39] <gotwig> but now of course, it just gets the value..
[11:27:45] <gotwig> hooooray
[11:28:06] <dblosevn> now fix my dang ckeditor lol
[11:28:40] <gotwig> dblosevn, ;P all that stuff feels so hacky to me..
[11:28:49] <gotwig> but actually I do like contenteditable
[11:29:21] <dblosevn> because it is, your implementation of jeditable is beyond insanely crazy
[11:29:45] <dblosevn> i coudld have done it all in about 4 lines of js
[11:30:13] <gotwig> xD
[11:30:21] <gotwig> the bad thing  is, my teacher actually has to eat my code :D
[11:31:01] <gotwig> dblosevn, you're a good guy =)
[11:31:08] <dblosevn> to use contentEditable youd have to write all of the hooks to submit the data to the server
[11:31:31] <gotwig> now lets help Armistice ...
[11:31:38] <dblosevn> being you have problems following a simple step by step api reference I dont think thats going to help
[11:31:50] <dblosevn> *-help + happen anytime soon
[11:32:14] <gotwig> dblosevn, SIMPLE? look at that statement :(
[11:32:30] <dblosevn> it got that complex because of your implementation
[11:32:34] <gotwig> in a normal POST request, I should just have done it more easily
[11:32:40] <gotwig> *could
[11:32:58] <gotwig> *ajax
[11:33:28] <dblosevn> thats the point you shouldnt even have to worry about the post :-) let the plugin do it for you
[11:37:50] <dblosevn> actually, i missed this in the api reference you can even tell jeditable not to fire the ajax request and let you handle the request on your own
[11:38:15] <gotwig> hm
[11:38:40] <dblosevn> goto the reference and search for Submitting to function instead of URL
[11:39:16] <dblosevn> This sounds just like you lol :-)Some people want to control absolutely everything. I want to keep you happy. You can get full control of Ajax request. Just submit to function instead of URL. Parameters passed are same as with callback.
[11:39:19] <gotwig> no, its ok
[11:39:22] <gotwig> i dont want problems, Sir xD
[11:39:43] <gotwig> your solution is quite smart, btw.
[11:39:50] <srj55> is it possible to search inside all iframes on the same page?  The iframes are all from the same origin.   e.g.  i tried this:   http://jsfiddle.net/YEBfE/3/
[11:41:13] <Cork> srj55: no, each iframe has there own document
[11:41:16] <gotwig> dblosevn, I still need some help :D
[11:41:18] <Cork> so you can't search cross them
[11:41:33] <dblosevn> ?
[11:41:49] <dblosevn> oh lol
[11:42:01] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1630514/
[11:42:04] <srj55> Cork:  could I loop using $.each() through all iframes in the document, then inside each one, do a search?
[11:42:08] <gotwig> http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[11:42:27] <gotwig> You see, when I select an editable field, automaticly all others show up the save button..
[11:42:38] <gotwig> I want that you see the save button just in the field where you edit
[11:42:38] <Cork> srj55: ya
[11:42:55] <gotwig> but you can't use 'this' because its actualy an other tag..
[11:43:02] <Cork> $('iframe').each(function() { $(this).contains().find('target'); });
[11:43:07] <Cork> srj55: ^
[11:43:25] <gotwig> would be cool to be able to use something like .. like  for paths xD
[11:44:32] <dblosevn> why arent you just using the save button option in jeditable, case in point overcomplicating lol
[11:44:42] <srj55> Cork:  it won't read the iframes.... http://jsfiddle.net/YEBfE/5/
[11:45:26] <gotwig> dblosevn, I don't like the solutions here
[11:45:40] <gotwig> dblosevn, I don't want that extra fields pop up, it should be really inline
[11:45:47] <Cork> srj55: you can't put iframe content inline in the iframe
[11:45:47] <gotwig> jeditable always pops up other stuff
[11:45:57] <gotwig> e.g I click, and then input pops up, or textarea..
[11:45:57] <Cork> it needs to be loaded from a src=""
[11:46:06] <gotwig> that looks shitty for boxes style...
[11:46:15] <Cork> (those iframes are empty)
[11:46:20] <gotwig> and now you teach me that I am wrong I guess ;D
[11:46:35] <srj55> Cork:  ok, gotcha. Thanks
[11:47:40] <dblosevn> gotwig: then dump jeditable and write listeners for the "boxes" and send the post to the server, better yet write a jquery plugin to do it for you :-)
[11:48:04] <gotwig> :(
[11:48:15] <gotwig> actuall I am a big hater of jquery :O
[11:48:21] * gotwig is sorry
[11:48:24] <gotwig> but I just do it for my job..
[11:48:40] <dblosevn> then write it in pure js skip the library
[11:48:45] <gotwig> lol
[11:48:46] <gotwig> yeah
[11:48:50] <gotwig> like a boss :)
[11:49:02] <dblosevn> your skill level doesnt seem high enough though to accomplish that
[11:49:10] <gotwig> dblosevn, yeah, Sir xD
[11:49:23] <gotwig> dblosevn, I still am able to manage that somehow..
[11:49:25] <dblosevn> hence why i suggested jeditable
[11:49:27] <gotwig> I just do it later
[11:49:43] <gotwig> dblosevn, you see, as I like boxes, I also got to save the position of each boxx
[11:49:50] <gotwig> dblosevn, what would you recommend for that?
[11:50:25] <dblosevn> gotwig: im gonna end up writing this thing before its over I can already see it lmao
[11:50:33] <gotwig> I want to save the position, after every move is completed. After a move is completed, gridster.js delivers a class
[11:50:51] <gotwig> dblosevn, lol :(
[11:51:19] <gotwig> I just start, and don't chat too much ;)
[11:52:39] <dblosevn> well it looks like you already got the drag and drop worked out
[11:53:02] <gotwig> yeah, I just have to link that with a database
[11:53:17] <gotwig> I dont know the right event that happens after a drag..
[11:53:36] <gotwig> the event handler for jquery should give me here something..?
[11:55:23] <dblosevn> gotwig: this is about the time you go ... hey let me check the gridster api reference and figure out what event to use
[11:55:31] <gotwig> xD
[11:55:35] <gotwig> :(
[11:57:53] * gotwig g2g to eat
[11:58:09] <gotwig> thanks again for your patience..
[12:01:08] <dblosevn> gotwig: update your gridster config to this http://dblosevn.chosd.com/60
[12:04:26] <dblosevn> hey cork, I figured out that all the content in the ckediter is always going to be the same width and determined a zoom level that works to display the entire width in the editor.
[12:05:08] <dblosevn> the problem i am having is even though i have verified the zoom level is set, it doesnt actually take effect unless i switch to source and back to html
[12:05:23] <dblosevn> any ideas on how i can remedy that?
[12:05:57] <Cork> dblosevn: not sure
[12:06:15] <Cork> might be your changing the original instead of what ckeditor uses or something
[12:07:12] <dblosevn> i inspected the element immediately after ckeditor rendered it and style="zoom:0.745" is in the body of the iframe
[12:07:35] <Cork> zoom is ie only
[12:07:54] <dblosevn> if i remove that arrib and add it right back it zooms out
[12:08:00] <dblosevn> *attrib
[12:08:14] <dblosevn> in chrome
[12:08:58] <dblosevn> or if i simply toggle the display of the editor it zooms out
[12:09:02] <Cork> wait you mean chrome listens to the old ie css rule?
[12:09:11] <dblosevn> i guess so lol
[12:09:22] <dblosevn> cause it definitely works when it wants to
[12:09:50] <Cork> well its not a standard rule, so its not cross browser
[12:10:11] <Cork> transform: scale is the standard complaint rule
[12:11:34] <dblosevn> hmm might be the reason why
[12:11:53] <dblosevn> also i cant add the attrib until after domready
[12:12:01] <dblosevn> maybe it has to be there before
[12:12:01] <Armistice> http://213.249.219.79/projects/JLT/index4.html still having problems, click on a button in the middle and the whole thing will slide into place. The quote at the bottom, instead of sliding like the rest, it'll do a little jump... then it'll slide a little. Any ideas why?
[12:12:48] <Cork> dblosevn: relying on zoom, in anything other then ie is a bad idea
[12:13:07] <dblosevn> im looking at the reference on transform: scale now
[12:13:12] <Cork> all other browsers that support it only have a minimal compatibility implementation at best
[12:13:29] <Cork> and i KNOW some browsers don't support it at all
[12:13:39] <Cork> like opera and firefox
[12:13:45] <Armistice> Any idea of my issue?
[12:13:56] <tw2113> oh IE you cursed bitch
[12:14:10] <gotwig> dblosevn, cool
[12:15:34] <gotwig> dblosevn, unexpected string
[12:16:08] <dblosevn> cork: i did it but it doesnt have the desired effect
[12:16:36] <Cork> dblosevn: ya, it is a bit different, but like i said, zoom is an ie only thing
[12:17:56] <dblosevn> Cork: i would assume that zoom: 0.745; and -webkit-transform: scale(0.745,0.745) would be equivalent
[12:18:37] <dblosevn> but they are way different the transform added all kins of top and left margin
[12:18:45] <dblosevn> *kinds
[12:19:06] <QbY> Can someone point me to a tutorial/example where when a button is pressed a dialog is shown for confirmation.
[12:19:22] <dblosevn> Cork: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/61
[12:20:23] <dblosevn> did i do that right?
[12:22:12] <dblosevn> its weird because the content is the right size its just in the bottom right corner of the box and the box is still the same size as it was before zooming out
[12:22:29] <tw2113> dblosevn, i'd put the non prefixed last
[12:23:27] <dblosevn> tw2113: no change
[12:24:00] <tw2113> it's not a change that would affect the actual css
[12:24:12] <tw2113> mostly a making sure the non-prefixed gets used once the browser supports it
[12:24:19] <dblosevn> oh
[12:24:22] <dblosevn> got ya
[12:28:18] <erik-landvall> if I set a css value of an element to { 'left' : '-916px' } nad then retrives that value with position().left I get '-917'. This cant be normal right?
[12:28:42] <Armistice> http://jean-luctallis.com/ this works very sluggish in Firefox (click a button to see what i mean), in Chrome and Safari the quote will jump a bit, i believ eit's related to it converting percentage to px but only happens on the bottom not the top. safari is a bit like firefox but better. and in IE ... shockhorror it works perfectly.
[12:29:04] <Armistice> it could be the fact it's trying to do like... 5 things at once.
[12:29:09] <Armistice> to make it sluggish
[12:29:13] <Armistice> but the bottom quote i haven't a clue about
[12:30:58] <tw2113> dblosevn, i got it working http://jsbin.com/avewaw/1/edit
[12:31:23] <erik-landvall> Armistice I tryed your page, it has a very poor rendering .. have a look at this javascript I wrote .. It should make things much smother: https://github.com/erik-landvall/animator
[12:31:39] <tw2113> though not on the body tag
[12:33:45] <Armistice> erik-landvall: one way I could reduce the amount of movement is if I combined the blue strip and the buttons into one div and slide that one div. ;p
[12:34:22] <dblosevn> tw2113: ya i cant get it to work on the body tag either
[12:34:47] <tw2113> maybe for the better
[12:34:55] <tw2113> not sure why one would need it on that one
[12:36:21] <erik-landvall> Armistice, as long as you dont use requestAnimationFrame as your callback rutin. you will always be able to have a smother animation. When it's this big a part of your webpage as it is here I think you should give it a try...
[12:38:20] <erik-landvall> The issue I have is related to a slider I wrote, you can see it here: http://e-cigaretter.nu/produkter/eroll-startkit/
[12:38:43] <erik-landvall> if you click around the thumbs for a bit you notice a slite diff every time
[12:39:23] <erik-landvall> It comes from the fact that .position().left is returning the wrong value
[12:40:00] <erik-landvall> check the console and you notice the number -917 .. but the css value is clearly -916
[12:42:41] <dblosevn> tw2113: because I cant wrap the content in body
[12:42:57] <dblosevn> tw2113: think i may have found the answer trying to implment it now
[12:43:20] <tw2113> go dblosevn go!
[12:47:30] <erik-landvall> ok, so I changed the value from ul.position()left to vanilla, that is: ul[0].offsetLeft and then it works .. so clearly something is wrong with jquery here
[12:49:20] <mg983> Hello thar!
[12:50:43] <mg983> So I'm putting a site together, and I want to have the scrollbar (on the right) act like jquery ui's bound to select (http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/hotelrooms.html) … here's my site… http://coffee.matgargano.com/#!/coffee — can that be done?
[12:59:49] <dblosevn> tw2113: got it :-) !!!!
[13:00:24] <dblosevn> tw2113: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/62
[13:01:15] <dblosevn> transform-orgin was the missing key
[13:01:37] <tw2113> ok
[13:02:26] <dblosevn> now to figure out how to undo it in fullscreen :-(
[13:12:31] <AndyArmy> hi guys. I have used jquery to add a css class to a div if android is the user agent, but somthing isnot working can soembody pelase help : http://jsfiddle.net/Gs8nW/6/
[13:12:57] <Satoebbi> hi there! why smooth scroll isn't smoot on first click? http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/v6URL/
[13:13:25] <Shizen> hmmm... id is "#", class is "." ... what about name ?
[13:14:14] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy : choose the right library
[13:14:35] <Satoebbi> Shizen : attr('name')
[13:15:19] <AndyArmy> Satoebbi: how do you mean = im new to jquery
[13:15:51] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy : in jsfiddle tob-left corner
[13:16:03] <Satoebbi> Shizen : http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[13:17:30] <Shizen> $(attr('name')). ?
[13:17:46] <Shizen> h-mm
[13:17:49] <AndyArmy> Satoebbi: ok changed it - not going to make it work though! : http://jsfiddle.net/Gs8nW/7/
[13:17:55] <AndyArmy> there is something wrong with the actual lines of jquery code
[13:21:52] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy : i cant find the class="box" i the html !? what do you want to touch to fire the event?
[13:22:33] <tw2113>  <div id="eatFood" class="box">
[13:22:44] <tw2113> right after the body tag
[13:22:51] <Satoebbi> oh.. :) my mistake
[13:26:24] <Satoebbi> someone can tell me why "smooth scroll to" isn't so smoot sometimes? http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/v6URL/
[13:27:16] <nOStahl> hey guys why does jquery 1.9.1 auto hide buttons and such
[13:27:20] <nOStahl> http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1733/
[13:27:25] <AndyArmy> tw2113: whats wrong with that?
[13:27:34] <tw2113> nothing
[13:27:38] <tw2113> i was pointing it out to Satoebbi
[13:27:46] <crised> What's wrong with this syntaxis?
[13:27:46] <crised> http://jsfiddle.net/7ytBK/
[13:28:01] <Satoebbi> yep.. but AndyArmy i cant see any mistakes in the code
[13:28:06] <Satoebbi> its wrking well..
[13:29:49] <nOStahl> with toggle .animate can I use percentages for height some how
[13:29:54] <nOStahl> it seems to only work with pixels?
[13:30:02] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy maybe just you cant see the event, because there is no .fake-active{} in your css code
[13:30:44] <AndyArmy> there is...
[13:30:49] <gotwig> dblosevn, I somehow got it even to work :X
[13:30:54] <crised> http://jsfiddle.net/7ytBK/ This is executing only at startup not on blur
[13:30:56] <Satoebbi> nOStahl : sure you can: to_num+"%"
[13:30:58] <gotwig> dblosevn, but I still dont know how to get the id :D
[13:31:07] <dblosevn> what id?
[13:31:11] <nOStahl> $('#footer').animate({height: 0})
[13:31:12] <gotwig> the id of the li
[13:31:23] <AndyArmy> Satoebbi: .box:active, .box:fake-active { /* bubblehead added */     background-color: #f56e8b;  }
[13:31:32] <gotwig> when I am in that function, I've got this, but I don't can get the id from here
[13:31:40] <nOStahl> so id change the number 0 in that line to what?
[13:31:48] <gotwig> like how can I get the id of the element that I drag?
[13:31:57] <gotwig> or other attributes
[13:32:05] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy : .box.active, .box.fake-active !!
[13:32:21] <nOStahl> Satoebbi: http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1733/ this is what I'm playing with, jquery 1.9.1 keeps auto hiding the button though… setting it display: none
[13:33:07] <AndyArmy> Satoebbi: so if thats wrong - what should my jquery code be?
[13:34:49] <Satoebbi> AndyArmy:  the jquery code is ok, just replace your  .box:active, .box:fake-active  with  .box.active, .box.fake-active
[13:34:57] <Satoebbi> sorry for colors :)
[13:35:06] <QbY> i've got a repeating element <a> that I've got a function attached to.  If I put <a id=1>, how can i determine the ID when the script is called?
[13:35:24] <Satoebbi> nOStahl : what do you want as result?
[13:36:07] <nOStahl> Satoebbi: I want to have the footer default at 10% and then when you click the button it expands to 25% and the map div shrinks to 75%
[13:37:02] <gotwig> damn :(
[13:37:13] <gotwig> I tought http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6163510/jquery-draggables-get-id-of-dragable-solved could help
[13:37:19] <AndyArmy> ok Satoebbi well ive done that - and it still doesnt work. I need to make it such that when i touch a div the background colour changes and i have heard this is how you can do it with jquery
[13:37:21] <AndyArmy> but tis not working
[13:42:14] <Satoebbi> nOStahl http://jsfiddle.net/eapo/hThGb/1737/

[13:48:07] <gotwig> debugging javascript... ough
[13:49:03] <dblosevn> have you looked at the console?
[13:49:08] <gotwig> you get the callback when you visit http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php drag an element, and watch into your javascript console..
[13:49:09] <gotwig> yes
[13:49:11] <Satoebbi> nOStahl : oh i see.. add classes like .footer.large .footer.small and use click, not toggle
[13:49:15] <gotwig> there are so many properties, oh my god...
[13:49:25] <nOStahl> what is wrong with toggle
[13:49:31] <gotwig> dblosevn, I've tried all stuff like ui. but that is only for jQuery elements I guess
[13:49:33] <dblosevn> ya, i dumped all of them so you could find what your looking for
[13:49:40] <nOStahl> thats what everyone says to use if you google jquery show hide sidebar :)
[13:49:50] <gotwig> dblosevn, thx, but I didnt found them..

[14:01:53] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/64 sorry had a couple syntax errors, I tested this though and it works
[14:02:06] <gotwig> thx
[14:02:24] <dblosevn> gotwig: probally posting more info then you need but i figured I what the hell youll only ask me for it later anyways lmao
[14:02:31] <gotwig> xD
[14:02:46] <gotwig> dblosevn, are you on G+ xD?
[14:02:59] <dblosevn> scared to add you :-D
[14:03:18] <dblosevn> stalka lmao
[14:03:27] <dblosevn> i never get on there but i have an account
[14:03:33] <gotwig> :3
[14:03:37] <gotwig> Eduard Gotwig...
[14:03:41] <AndyArmy> Satoebbi: that does not work on android...
[14:03:57] <gotwig> count to infinity backwards and you will find my index number...
[14:04:59] <dblosevn> told you id end up writing it for you lol
[14:05:10] <gotwig> yeah thx
[14:05:14] <gotwig> that saved me hours ;D
[14:05:18] <relipse> how do i get the sibling of #dlgFoo
[14:05:33] <relipse> should i use closest()
[14:05:36] <dblosevn> gotwig: shoulda made you do it though ebcause you didnt learn anything
[14:05:52] <gotwig> yeah
[14:05:55] <gotwig> true
[14:06:02] <relipse> how do i grab the $('.ui-dialog-buttonset') that is closest to <div id="dlgInvoice">
[14:06:03] <gotwig> but debugging javascript is nasty, isnt it?
[14:06:09] <gotwig> I just use these chrome developer tools...
[14:06:16] <gotwig> When I would be able to search in all that
[14:06:21] <gotwig> with like ctrl+f it would be hadny
[14:06:25] <gotwig> *handy
[14:06:27] <dblosevn> gotwig: i went outside and smoked and built that post all in 5 minutes lol
[14:06:32] <gotwig> but I just can search on the output
[14:06:32] <relipse> ctrl-f does work gotwig
[14:06:36] <relipse> yeah you can?
[14:06:57] <gotwig> relipse, when I do like console.log(this)
[14:07:08] <gotwig> and I get an object, I cant search for all property values
[14:07:11] <gotwig> thats what I want...
[14:07:32] <relipse> what you mean? ctrl-f finds text
[14:07:36] <dblosevn> gotwig: its all in knowing what objects to search
[14:08:22] <dblosevn> gotwig: for instance I know from experience that event.target will have the element that fired the event
[14:08:45] <dblosevn> gotwig: I also know that element has data attribs attached to it with the rows and columns
[14:08:59] <crised> Guys, tried many things, can't get this thing to work http://jsfiddle.net/7ytBK/
[14:09:10] <dblosevn> gotwig: so with that in mind... var data = $(event.target).data();
[14:10:07] <dblosevn> gotwig: next up is the id being you chose for god knows what reason not to store it in a data attrib you have to get that seperately, I already know event.target has the element that was dragged in it so event.target.id will give me the id
[14:11:45] <gotwig> yeah...
[14:11:52] <dblosevn> gotwig: once you learn where to look 95% of the time you wont need to be able to "search the objects"
[14:13:37] <crised> How about this fiddle, still doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/Azmp7/
[14:14:17] <nOStahl> Satoebbi: hmm
[14:14:23] <nOStahl> Satoebbi: u still around
[14:24:21] <gotwig> dblosevn, anything wrong here ;D ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1630991/
[14:25:08] <nOStahl> gah how is this not working http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1746/  I got it working on the jsfiddle and then copy pasted it into my wordpress template I'm making and it does nothing when clicking the button..
[14:25:26] <dblosevn> gotwig: looks good, except your wide open to sql injection
[14:25:49] <gotwig> yeah
[14:25:53] <gotwig> I should escape the stuff
[14:26:02] <gotwig> I show you fast my js stuff...
[14:26:15] <dblosevn> well in this case i wouldnt escape it
[14:26:25] <dblosevn> all your params are intergers
[14:26:35] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1631000/
[14:26:40] <dblosevn> so id type cast them all to integers
[14:29:22] <gotwig> dblosevn, any idea :?
[14:30:26] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/65
[14:31:10] <gotwig>  well that doesnt solve my issue, does it?
[14:31:24] <dblosevn> what issue would that be?
[14:31:40] <gotwig> well, it doesnt work ;D
[14:31:44] <gotwig> <?php
[14:31:44] <gotwig> 	include("connect_inc.php");

[14:32:13] <gotwig> :>
[14:33:46] <dblosevn> ok i see the issue
[14:33:53] <dblosevn> only works on the text nodes
[14:34:38] <gotwig> and you missed an '
[14:34:41] <gotwig> in your latest past
[14:35:18] <gotwig> what you mean with only works on text nodes?
[14:35:28] <gotwig> your parseInt stuff?
[14:36:01] <Max-P> Hi, is there a way for a jQuery UI Draggable to scroll both the page body AND the div it was in? Draggables are also Droppables and are in a scrollable div, but there's also some droppables outside of the div so I need both the body AND the div to be scrollable while dragging a Draggable
[14:37:01] <relipse> any jqueryui experts in here? i need help with something i can put it on jsfiddle
[14:38:10] <Max-P> relipse, Don't ask to ask the question, just ask the question and see if anyone can help
[14:38:13] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @relipse
[14:38:13] <b-ot> relipse: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:38:13] <bot-t> relipse, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:38:46] <relipse> ok heres the deal
[14:38:50] <gotwig> dblosevn, hm?
[14:39:04] <gotwig> dblosevn, for what was that meant? your new function parse stuff?
[14:39:54] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/66
[14:40:09] <relipse> i hacked up jqueryui dialog a bit, prepending my own html <div id="fillme"></div> to the buttonset section, when i open the dialog, i go ahead and populate $('#fillme').html(...), well i'm populating it with a split button drop down like on the jqueryui examples and it doesnt display right
[14:40:46] <gotwig> nope, sir :X
[14:40:51] <relipse> when i click the drop down menu, the whole button moves over left like an inch
[14:40:53] <gotwig> doesn't work...
[14:41:04] <dblosevn> let me see i tested it in the debugger as i wrote it
[14:41:22] <gotwig> I should  print the $sql statement
[14:42:22] <Max-P> relipse, You probably broke the CSS selector path by adding your own element. Check what changes in the applied styles (Chrome dev console or Firefox dev console) with and without your extra element.
[14:42:40] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/67
[14:44:28] <crised> Anyone can't tell me why my page behaves differently from this fiddle?? http://jsfiddle.net/Azmp7/8/ I can see the I'm here alert, but can't see the hello alert
[14:46:48] <gotwig> nope :X
[14:47:11] <gotwig> I guess I wrote bad sql
[14:47:25] <gotwig> the sql could by something like UPDATE gridentries SET data-row=5, data-column=6 WHERE id=492;
[14:47:55] <nOStahl> : hey guys I just setup this in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1748/ and trying to add it to a base template I'm starting for wordpress and just can't get it working, I have jquery loaded and the css and html are all there ….. but I click the button and nothing happens with the wordpress template
[14:48:44] <dblosevn> gotwig: that will never work anyways
[14:49:03] <gotwig> what do you mean :(
[14:49:12] * gotwig is not a looser
[14:49:27] * dblosevn gotwig cant even spell loser
[14:49:38] <gotwig> ^^
[14:49:48] * gotwig thats how it is
[14:50:27] <dblosevn> even if you fix your sql statement though it wont work
[14:50:50] <happyface> is there a nice plugin to append li's to a fixed-length list while animating pushing the other elements down?
[14:53:54] <gotwig> yeah
[14:53:55] <gotwig> broken SQL
[14:55:15] <dblosevn> not only the sql your code has a logic error
[14:55:21] <dblosevn> well i should say my code
[14:56:07] <dblosevn> unless the plugin your using has an event to catch the flaw hold up
[14:58:20] <gotwig> hm it works somehow
[14:58:32] <gotwig> the flaw?
[14:58:49] <gotwig> you mean other elements thare also changing their position afte that?
[15:00:44] <dblosevn> ya when a collision happens and the dragged cell takes the place of another cell
[15:01:28] <gotwig> >.<
[15:01:45] <dblosevn> eg theres a box in row 2 col2 and you drag a box from row 1 col 5 to row 2 col 2 the current implementation wont update the box that previously was in row 2 col 2
[15:01:48] <sahbeewah> nOStahl, toggle hides/shows elements... it doesn't handle events
[15:01:57] <sahbeewah> nOStahl, http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1749/
[15:02:06] <gotwig> dblosevn, so loop :X?
[15:02:14] <gotwig> I have to update just all...
[15:02:26] <dblosevn> much more elegant then that lol
[15:02:41] <gotwig> ?!!
[15:02:51] <dblosevn> im almost done
[15:06:18] <gotwig> oh I  got it
[15:06:30] <gotwig> you simply add a jquery event thing for every thing that changes?
[15:07:12] <nOStahl> sahbeewah: checking it out now
[15:07:17] <dblosevn> gotwig: ya im gonna do that jquery event thing
[15:07:24] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/68
[15:07:45] <gotwig> thats so smart, muhaha :>
[15:08:02] <gotwig> oh...
[15:08:05] <gotwig> you use serialize
[15:08:07] <dblosevn> now your gonna have to rewrite your handler
[15:08:12] <gotwig> yea
[15:08:13] <someprimetime> dblosevn is a smart little boy
[15:08:26] <someprimetime> listen to what he says
[15:08:32] <gotwig> :(!
[15:08:38] <dblosevn> $boxes = json_decode($_POST['data']);
[15:08:42] <gotwig> its so late, I have to listen to somebody ;D
[15:09:50] <gotwig> ok...
[15:09:54] <nOStahl> sahbeewah: what tool can I use to check where the break down is, this wordpress template that I'm trying to add this too, the button does nothing
[15:10:12] <nOStahl> its like jquery is not finding the button to take over
[15:10:25] <someprimetime> right click on it
[15:10:31] <someprimetime> in chrome inspector tools go to Event Listenrs
[15:10:31] <gotwig> with your new code
[15:10:35] <gotwig> I get like total madness :(
[15:10:36] <someprimetime> s/nrs/ers
[15:10:36] <nOStahl> k
[15:10:39] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/69
[15:11:17] <gotwig> on the javascript side
[15:11:31] <dblosevn> umm being that post starts with <?php id think not
[15:12:06] <nOStahl> where is event listeners
[15:12:08] <dblosevn> i was just lazy and didnt change the language
[15:12:19] <osirisx11> hi all
[15:12:47] <dblosevn> gotwig: and being i dont know what you did to fix your sql youll have to fix it again
[15:12:57] <gotwig> oh yeah
[15:13:12] <gotwig> but I talk about javascript side
[15:13:19] <gotwig> it shouldnt influence the output
[15:13:27] <dblosevn> um dude
[15:13:36] <gotwig> jo...
[15:13:41] <dblosevn> im sending an array of boxes to the server now not just one
[15:13:42] <relipse> what is the best place to find png commercial-usage (no linkback required) icons?
[15:13:46] <nOStahl> someprimetime: were you telling me to use chrome inspector and go to event listeners?
[15:13:59] <someprimetime> yeah you said there is a button that doesn't do anything?
[15:13:59] <osirisx11> can anyone please suggest a good pattern on how to fill a block element with ul/li's (dynamic spacing for LI's)?
[15:14:05] <dblosevn> the server side needs to be rewritten which ive already done to accomodate that
[15:14:05] <someprimetime> but it's in the DOM?
[15:14:21] <gotwig> yeah
[15:14:31] <gotwig> but I say that the javascript stuff is not  clean...
[15:14:43] <dblosevn> i wrote it of course its clean...
[15:15:22] <nOStahl> someprimetime: aye
[15:15:43] <gotwig> unexpected token . in the return line
[15:15:54] <nOStahl> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1749/ i got that, and added it to where its suppose to go with my new wordpress template I'm starting
[15:15:56] <gotwig> you can see that when you visit the website
[15:16:06] <nOStahl> this is first time i've tried playing with jquery with wordpress templates before
[15:16:13] <someprimetime> nOStahl: what is the question?
[15:16:26] <nOStahl> its not working :)
[15:16:31] <nOStahl> but works in jsfiddle
[15:16:53] <someprimetime> you have the code posted exactly like that?
[15:16:54] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/70 besides my missing token lol
[15:17:10] <nOStahl> 		<script type="text/javascript" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory');?>/js/jquery.js"></script>
[15:17:19] <nOStahl> I have jquery loaded correctly
[15:17:38] <someprimetime> nOStahl: well that's a good start
[15:17:39] <gotwig> I am blind :Y
[15:17:51] <someprimetime> are you putting more than one ID on your page?
[15:18:01] <someprimetime> e.g. do you have more than one <div id="map"></div>
[15:18:04] <gotwig> I better go out and scream a bit..
[15:18:10] <gotwig> thx for your help again, dblosevn
[15:18:12] <nOStahl> just one div labeled map and one div labeled footer
[15:18:28] <someprimetime> that's what i just asked but sure
[15:18:37] <someprimetime> is this code uploaded somewhere?
[15:18:43] <gotwig> well it still does not work, but what ever =)
[15:18:45] <someprimetime> not the jsfiddle version
[15:18:55] <nOStahl> someprimetime: I tried putting the js in-between <script> </script> in header, didn't work  tried putting it in my js-functions.js file and didn't work there either
[15:19:09] <nOStahl> its just localhost right now
[15:19:29] <nOStahl> mamp if that makes any difference
[15:19:34] <someprimetime> no
[15:19:42] <dblosevn> gotwig: think i underestimated the way it would serialize the data, my controller wont work
[15:19:44] <someprimetime> that makes no difference and if you are loading jquery then it's probably something else
[15:19:58] <gotwig> an other structure, yeah
[15:19:59] <someprimetime> put this in your html page <script>$(function() { alert('yo'); }); </script>
[15:20:02] <someprimetime> does that alert?
[15:20:13] <someprimetime> also are you checking your console log?
[15:20:38] <dblosevn> gotwig: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/71
[15:20:41] <nOStahl> it worked
[15:20:45] <nOStahl> the yo
[15:20:59] <dblosevn> gotwig: I assumed it would be normal and jsonencode the post, but it didnt
[15:21:14] <someprimetime> ok then it's probably something with your selectors i'm assuming
[15:21:44] <gotwig> still, no chance
[15:21:52] <gotwig> I think its the controller, yeah, so php
[15:22:10] <dblosevn> var_dump($_POST); at the top of the controller
[15:22:10] <nOStahl> someprimetime: selectors?
[15:23:00] <someprimetime> yes as in the CSS classes/ids that you attach to your jquery code that knows what elements to listen to
[15:23:23] <dblosevn> gotwig: let me know when your done
[15:23:36] <nOStahl> its just map and footer div's
[15:23:38] <gotwig> :X
[15:23:40] <someprimetime> wordpress is probably adding it's own footer or something in there additionally
[15:23:41] <gotwig> wrong file..
[15:23:44] <someprimetime> idk wordpress sucks
[15:23:55] <someprimetime> it generates a lot of unnecessary garbage
[15:23:58] <nOStahl> wordpress dosnt suck :)
[15:24:15] <dblosevn> matter of opinion ^^
[15:24:18] <gotwig> dblosevn, what you mean with done
[15:24:30] <gotwig> its 00:24 AM, I'm done ;D
[15:24:31] <dblosevn> putting that var_dmp in the controller
[15:24:37] <dblosevn> *var_dump
[15:25:01] <gotwig> var_dump for  what
[15:25:11] <someprimetime> nOStahl: sure ok
[15:25:20] <dblosevn> [17:22] <dblosevn> var_dump($_POST); at the top of the controller
[15:25:26] <gotwig> ohhh
[15:25:27] <gotwig> sry
[15:26:19] <gotwig> done..
[15:27:18] <dblosevn> remove that var dump
[15:27:27] <dblosevn> and replace this line $box = array_map('parseInt', $box); var_dump($box); echo "\n";
[15:27:57] <gotwig> done
[15:27:57] <nOStahl> someprimetime: hmm, this is just weird
[15:29:16] <nOStahl> wordpress splits things up between header.php , footer.php , index.php to build a whole page
[15:29:18] <dblosevn> gotwig: are you still json_decode ing?
[15:29:23] <Ziber> Using .load(), can I load a specific ID within a remote page?
[15:29:38] <gotwig> huh, no ...
[15:29:40] <gotwig> wait..
[15:29:54] <nOStahl> someprimetime: I  have it including header and footer and its all working . is there some weird thing with it not registering the button in the footer?
[15:29:57] <gotwig> somehow I got problems with versions :X
[15:30:05] <dblosevn> if you are replace with $boxes = $_POST['data'];
[15:30:13] <someprimetime> nOStahl: what did I tell you to do already?
[15:30:18] <someprimetime> right click on the button and go to event listeners
[15:30:25] <someprimetime> see if you have a click event attached to it
[15:30:28] <nOStahl> I didn't see where event listeners were
[15:30:29] <gotwig> no, I dont have decode
[15:30:47] <someprimetime> nOStahl: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/elements
[15:31:08] <gotwig> should I place 	$box = array_map('parseInt', $box); var_dump($box); echo "\n"; inside the loop?
[15:31:11] <someprimetime> actually http://lmgtfy.com/?q=event+listeners+chrome+inspector
[15:32:02] <gotwig> yeah not it throws results
[15:32:07] <gotwig> from the array, in developer tools
[15:32:09] <gotwig> *now
[15:32:12] <dblosevn> gotwig: replace $boxes = $_POST['data']; with $boxes = $_POST['data']; var_dump($boxes); echo "\n";
[15:32:18] <gotwig> sry, I had the thing in the wrong line
[15:32:19] <nOStahl> ah I didn't ever see that tab down there
[15:32:21] <gotwig> dblosevn, yeah i did
[15:32:25] <nOStahl> only thought css showed up over there P
[15:32:30] <dblosevn> with the dump?
[15:32:52] <nOStahl> does not look like there is a listener just has two lines for right click
[15:33:11] <dblosevn> never mind that is what its supposed to look like
[15:33:16] <dblosevn> you can remove the dumps
[15:33:31] <dblosevn> so its all on your sql statement now
[15:34:02] <nOStahl> someprimetime: clicked checkbox for view only listeners for node selected and it states there are no listeners
[15:34:06] <dblosevn> gotwig also replace $post in your sql statement with $box
[15:34:16] <dblosevn> all occurences of it
[15:34:32] <gotwig> wait, I show you my paste..
[15:34:37] <dblosevn> k
[15:35:31] <gotwig> jo it works
[15:35:36] <gotwig> but I still show you my paste
[15:35:58] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1631187/
[15:36:33] <dblosevn_should_> gotwig: you can remove this var_dump($box); echo "\n";
[15:36:53] <someprimetime> nOStahl: then that's your problem
[15:37:17] <nOStahl> someprimetime: how do I fix this, the code works on jsfiddle. but not on my template...
[15:37:20] <gotwig> good night :X
[15:37:21] <someprimetime> attach an id to the button and in your code make it something like $('#my-toggle-btn').click()
[15:37:26] <gotwig> and thank you really much...
[15:37:31] <nOStahl> k
[15:37:34] <nOStahl> trying that
[15:37:35] <someprimetime> so <button id="my-toggle-btn">button</button>
[15:37:37] <someprimetime> or something
[15:37:38] <gotwig> I should start to  read some more
[15:37:44] <nOStahl> didn't think I needed that cause I only have the one button in my code
[15:37:53] <dblosevn_should_> gotwig: night
[15:37:54] <nOStahl> testing now
[15:38:55] <nOStahl> same deal
[15:39:06] <nOStahl> added id to button and added the id to the js
[15:48:57] <nOStahl> ahhahh fixed it
[16:04:24] <Ziber> Easiest way to determine whether or not a parameter is set in a URL?
[16:06:54] <gotwig> Ziber, GET
[16:07:03] <gotwig> Ziber, with PHP
[16:07:10] <Ziber> I want to do it in JS.
[16:07:21] <Ziber> I'm familiar with $_GET[] though.
[16:07:27] <gotwig> ok...
[16:07:38] <Ziber> How would I be able to do it in JS?
[16:10:14] <Aero`> Hi guys ! I'm in a bit of a trouble with sendinx data with $.ajax() ! My problem is that I'd like to send BOTH an array of ID's and form serialized data. No luck with pushing id's into the serialized data array, or merging both arrays, so far... Any idea ? Thanks in advance for your help !
[16:12:41] <Ziber> I sorta figured it out.
[16:13:11] <Ziber> Now, anyone able to tell me why the links can't be clicked on in the dropdown menu? http://x.jkode.us/captcha/?dd=1
[16:28:15] <Armistice> http://213.249.219.79/projects/JLT/index5.html ok so ok here, you'd click a title and it'll slideUp/down. In firefox it's very ... "laggy", it won't run so smoothly as it does in Chrome. Anyway to make it run smoother?

[16:37:12] <opus_> my friend told me he was using a web server side script to connect to a browser that gave him  a prompt where he could do local file commands like a directory and sql stuff, has anyone ever heard of anything like this? like a shell for a browser
[16:37:56] <gf3> Why would you ever want such a thing!?
[16:38:08] <gf3> Just use a terminal
[16:38:20] <opus_> experimenting
[16:38:28] <gf3> NO EXPERIMENTING
[16:39:38] <opus_> is there a chrome plugin to block hover/popup thingies
[16:39:49] <opus_> like "subscribe to my mailing list"
[16:40:06] <nOStahl> just subscribe to them and they go away
[16:40:36] <opus_> can i use your email address

[16:40:54] <nOStahl> sure its 5551234565@gmail.com
[16:43:57] <opus_> what about DOM mirroring
[16:48:34] <Armistice> what would be the cause for slideUp/Down even with easing "Linear" to be slow in Firefox? it's all stuttery
[17:00:20] <rakl> if is a jquery object of html elements, how do I map the data-id attributes from the elements?
[17:00:32] <rakl> a.each(function() {return $(this).data('id')})
[17:00:34] <rakl> doesn't work
[17:00:43] <rakl> t returns the same objects
[17:32:27] <dblosevn_away> aero: var post = {form: $(this).serialize(), ids: yourarr};
[17:32:48] <Macey> hey all,, i have a draggable into a droppable sortable... but the id don't come over when dropped
[17:38:23] <Macey> http://pastebin.com/q2ge885a
[17:38:50] <Macey> any thoughts?
[17:53:00] <Marius80> hi
[17:53:32] <Marius80> I would need to solve something in jquery,  but my knowledge of jquery is very basic
[17:53:52] <Marius80> are people around this time at all?
[17:55:49] <coldhead> people would already be answering your question if you'd only asked it already :)
[17:55:56] <Marius80> sorry
[17:56:19] <Marius80> there is a jquery plugin called "flexslider" which does 99% of what I'd need
[17:56:29] <Marius80> the remaining 1% is very hard to solve for me
[17:56:50] <Marius80> since english is not my first language,  I'd like to show you what I would like ao achieve,  and what I got
[17:57:27] <coldhead> yes
[17:57:41] <Marius80> good:   http://jeremycowart.com/
[17:57:42] <Marius80> bad:  http://www.webdevout.net/test?012&raw
[17:57:52] <Marius80> the "good" example also used flexslider
[17:58:12] <Marius80> the "bad" example used the same,  but the behavior when scaling the window is very different
[17:58:34] <Marius80> let's imagine you have a large screen and the browser window is maximized
[17:58:55] <Marius80> the first site would show the image at a width of 100% and a height of ... I guess 400px
[17:59:19] <coldhead> so the problem is when you resize to a small window you can't see the navigation
[17:59:25] <Marius80> when you scale down the window,  and change the size to a ratio of 4:3 (kind of) the image also changes
[17:59:28] <coldhead> like you can in the good example
[17:59:34] <Marius80> nope
[17:59:53] <Marius80> oh, maybe yes
[18:00:02] <Marius80> you just define it in other words
[18:00:13] <Marius80> the height of the image in the "bad" example is too height
[18:00:16] <Marius80> thats the problem
[18:00:29] <Marius80> I tried many,  many things
[18:00:42] <Marius80> one of the best solutions was:
[18:00:43] <Marius80> <div id="slider" class="flexslider" style="max-height:500px; overflow: hidden;">
[18:01:06] <Marius80> but,  this crops the bottom...   it would be better if it would crop from the top and from the bottom
[18:01:27] <Marius80> because there will be images of people,  and seeing the eyes would be more interesting than seeing the hair
[18:02:37] <coldhead> did you look at how flexslider is set up on the "good" example? http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/themes/jeremy-cowart/js/screen.js?ver=0.0.1
[18:03:18] <Marius80> yes, but copiing the whole stuff would be illegal in my country
[18:03:35] <Marius80> I thought about a solution like this:
[18:03:41] <coldhead> you don't have to copy it, just see what it does differently and use that
[18:03:44] <Marius80> $(function() {
[18:03:44] <Marius80> var $img = $('.slides img');
[18:03:44] <Marius80> var h = $img.height();
[18:03:44] <Marius80> $img.css('margin-top', + h / -2 + "px");
[18:03:44] <Marius80> });
[18:03:45] <coldhead> what is your country
[18:03:50] <Marius80> austria
[18:03:54] <Marius80> (next to germany)
[18:04:09] <coldhead> yes i am familiar with austria. beethoven and so on :)
[18:04:18] <Marius80> yep :)
[18:04:49] <Marius80> coldhead, luv you for that,  most people say:  "Austria?  Cool,  kangaroo's!!!"
[18:05:53] <coldhead> i am in australia, and when i say i am from here they say "you speak english very well"
[18:06:07] <Marius80> lol :))
[18:06:20] <Marius80> Don't they say "Ozzy" to australians?
[18:07:12] <coldhead> yes
[18:07:18] <Marius80> In german,  we say "Ossi" (sound the same like Ozzy)  to people who lived "behind the wall" in east-germany
[18:07:28] <coldhead> i see!
[18:08:07] <Marius80> well now,  whats about telling the images to have a negative margin-top?
[18:08:12] <coldhead> okay, i think i see how they do the size thing
[18:08:13] <Marius80> like I pasted before?
[18:08:18] <Marius80> really?
[18:08:23] <coldhead> they have a better way than your way
[18:08:36] <Marius80> I have been looking at the source for a very long time and did not see it
[18:08:44] <coldhead> they have a <div id="fullscreen"> which crops the image
[18:08:58] <Marius80> yes,  I saw that one ...
[18:08:59] <coldhead> so the image is still "big" but you only see enough for it to fit on the screen
[18:09:04] <Marius80> it has a looot of CSS Source
[18:09:13] <Marius80> and nothing from that says me what they are really doing
[18:09:19] <coldhead> if you search for #fullScreenHome in http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/themes/jeremy-cowart/js/screen.js?ver=0.0.1
[18:09:46] <coldhead> you can see a resize() functon which changes the size of #fullScreenHome when the window is resized
[18:09:59] <Marius80> true that...
[18:10:02] <Marius80> one moment please
[18:10:07] <Marius80> I need to understand that first
[18:10:29] <coldhead> the code you care about is from .resize( to $("#fullScreenHome").height(fullScreenHeight);
[18:10:39] <coldhead> the rest of the code is to move the other elements like the title around
[18:10:50] <coldhead> try to understand how the first part works and reproduce it
[18:10:55] <coldhead> then you can work on the other elements
[18:11:01] <coldhead> i have to go for a picnic now, i am sorry
[18:11:09] <coldhead> #jQuery can help you! good luck!
[18:11:31] <tw2113> evening head of the COld
[18:13:07] <Marius80> ok, coldhead thank you very much
[18:57:48] <mouses> i have a simple, single-page design for an artist. it has basic sections like featured, bio, photos, videos, contact... 99% of the site content is loaded through ajax. i want to make the site more seo friendly...
[18:58:34] <tw2113> so the entire initial page load is all ajax too?
[18:59:09] <mouses> my webhost is php and doesnt offer java unless i go vps or dedicated.. is there a way to create an html snapshot with php? all of the suggested tools on google developer suggest java based html snapshot generators
[18:59:28] <tw2113> java != javascript
[18:59:38] <mouses> no shit bro
[18:59:46] <mouses> lol
[18:59:59] <tw2113> why do you need java then?
[19:00:36] <mouses> https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started
[19:00:38] <mouses> "If a lot of your content is produced with JavaScript, you may want to use a headless browser such as HtmlUnit to obtain the HTML snapshot. Alternatively, you can use a different tool such as crawljax or watij.com."
[19:01:00] <mouses> all 3 of those are java
[19:01:08] <codacoder> nay jQ team here?
[19:01:15] <codacoder> any*
[19:01:43] <tw2113> personally, i'd have initial contact loaded via just plain html etc, and then once you need to change the content, do it with ajax however you're talking about
[19:02:01] <tw2113> but i don't know your specs either so what do i know
[19:03:38] <mouses> my bio contains sections that load and fade in and out based on what chapter, so i need to use js xhr (ajax) for that, my photo gallery is a set of thumbs which load a larger image with data about the photo when clicked, so thats best for ajax too, and my video section also has thumbs that load video and data about the video
[19:04:14] <mouses> its just that now google wont index any of my page content because it's almost all ajax loaded
[19:04:17] <tw2113> yeah, that's awesome, but does it need to be loaded via ajax on page load?
[19:04:29] <tw2113> have static content that you change AFTER loading
[19:05:03] <mouses> so kill all of the dummy static content on page load?
[19:05:17] <tw2113> something that a visitor would see if they visited your site with javascript disabled
[19:05:21] <mouses> dummy for search engines i mean
[19:09:47] -hubbard.freenode.net- [freenode-info] channel trolls and no channel staff around to help? please check with freenode support: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#gettinghelp
[19:09:47] <mouses_> i use json to store the video thumbs and info
[19:10:01] <tw2113> i'd probably use picture screenshots to click on
[19:10:16] <tw2113> and perhaps use data-attributes to store the video ID for embedding
[19:10:24] <tw2113> and on click change out the image for an iframe embed
[19:11:44] <mouses_> damn
[19:11:56] <mouses_> my code is so fucking pretty right now
[19:12:07] <mouses_> sounds like a whole new architecture
[19:14:55] <mouses_> thanks for the help. i'm interested in other opinions on this
[19:15:53] <tw2113> static content on load = crawlable
[19:16:20] <dblosevn_away> doesnt google parse the js on the backend though lol
[19:16:32] <dblosevn_away> i swear they have been working on doing that in the past
[19:16:36] <tw2113> couldn't tell you for sure
[19:16:53] <dblosevn_away> google gets places on your site it should never be able to find
[19:17:42] <dblosevn> i had a projects directory once that denied directory listing at the top level and each client directory allowed directory listing
[19:17:43] <ryanneufeld> they parse some basic stuff
[19:17:48] <ryanneufeld> but not like hover events and shit
[19:17:53] <dblosevn> google indexed the whole damn tree
[19:18:06] <dblosevn> no links to the content or anything
[19:18:47] <dblosevn> i finally got blacklisted for phishing because i had so many sites that were identical to production sites on the web
[19:18:57] <mouses_> well i just updated the site a couple days ago to be 90% js loaded, so google isnt showing me those results in search yet. i should be able to use Fetch as Google to test, right?
[19:19:10] <dblosevn> had to get rid of that domain because all my clients that used opendns couldnt get to my site
[19:19:37] <wad> I'm an experienced Java programmer, interested in doing some front-end work. I'd like to try out Ajax and JQuery. Can anyone here recommend a book for me?
[19:19:55] <ryanneufeld> Jared is that you?
[19:19:57] <mouses_> books are old-school
[19:20:06] * wad <---------------- old school
[19:20:07] <mouses_> just google the docs
[19:20:12] <dblosevn> people still buy books?
[19:20:18] <mouses_> jquery.com has everything you need
[19:20:26] <ryanneufeld> learn.jquery.com
[19:20:34] <dblosevn> wget -r api.jquery.com
[19:20:41] <wad> Okay, I'll give that a shot.
[19:20:43] <ryanneufeld> also codeschool.com and google
[19:20:45] <dblosevn> theres your book
[19:20:45] <mouses_> as soon as the book is printed, it's outdated
[19:20:51] <ryanneufeld> wad: are you Jared?
[19:20:58] * wad is not Jared. :)
[19:21:02] <dylix> hrm something is wrong with those links
[19:21:05] <dylix> i cant click them
[19:21:13] <dylix> ;)
[19:21:14] <ryanneufeld> ok
[19:21:24] <wad>  /whois wad
[19:21:46] <dblosevn> ?learn @ wad
[19:21:47] <bot-t> wad, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[19:22:04] <dblosevn> ooo the bots awake today :-)
[19:22:16] <ryanneufeld> sorry wad, I know someone who also uses that name
[19:22:49] <wad> ryanneufeld, the nick "wad" has been mine on freenode for a long time :)
[19:23:20] <dblosevn> wad: maybe you were drunk and forgot your name and said you were jared :-)
[19:23:56] <wad> Okay, so I learn best by giving myself a problem to solve. Currently, I'm considering rewriting my little hobby project all in Javascript (http://funwithbasic.com)
[19:24:42] <wad> I'd like to turn it into a modern web application. Right now the back-end is just some Java servlets, running under Tomcat 7.
[19:25:00] <wad> So, if I use Ajax (JQuery) for the front end, what should I do about the back?
[19:26:54] <mouses_> are you guys familiar with #! and html snapshots?
[19:26:59] <dblosevn> you wrote a basic interpreter in java?
[19:27:04] <wad> dblosevn, yes
[19:27:12] <wad> It runs in an applet on the user's machine.
[19:27:13] <dblosevn> kudos :-)
[19:27:31] <dblosevn> my first language BASICA lol
[19:27:46] <wad> Most people would think I'm crazy. But my kids wanted to do programming, and you don't just toss them into Scala at that age....
[19:28:05] <dblosevn> ya i learned BASICA when i was 8
[19:28:10] <gf3> Psh
[19:28:18] <gf3> I learned Perl when I was young
[19:28:25] <wad> And I couldn't find ANYTHING useful for kids to just pound in some programs, so I just wrote a BASIC interpreter in Java, stuck it into an applet, and made it a web page.
[19:28:27] <gf3> Python or Ruby would be great for kids
[19:28:39] <n1n0> can someone help me fetch the root folder of a certain site
[19:28:40] <dblosevn> perl lol
[19:28:56] <dblosevn> they still got the mindspace for the obfusication lol
[19:29:19] <dblosevn> perl has got to be the only language that looks the same before and after obfusication :-D
[19:29:51] <wad> So, is it feasible to write a BASIC interpreter in Javascript, and make a kid-oriented website around it? So kids can create and share their programs?
[19:30:10] <wad> I've never done any javascript.
[19:30:11] <gf3> I guess
[19:30:13] <dblosevn> id think that would be pretty heavy on the js engine
[19:30:33] * wad nods
[19:30:43] <wad> The js engine isn't multithreaded, is it?
[19:30:47] <dblosevn> did you support the whole language
[19:30:52] <dblosevn> nope all in a single thread
[19:31:00] <wad> dblosevn, sure. It even has graphics.
[19:31:10] <wad> Oh, I don't have file I/O yet, or sound.
[19:31:28] <dblosevn> do thoughs apis even still exist lol
[19:31:49] <wad> Hmm, so maybe for the interim I'll just use JQuery for the web application, and use the Java applet to run the BASIC programs.
[19:32:00] <dblosevn> i tried a few years ago to install qasic and it told me i was shit out of luck
[19:32:08] <dblosevn> needed an 8bit machine
[19:32:28] <wad> dblosevn, heh, yeah, FunWithBasic.com may meet your needs. ;)
[19:32:35] <greg5green> im not sure you can expect anyone to want to run a java applet
[19:33:01] <dblosevn> ooo
[19:33:20] <dblosevn> interpret server side and write the output to an rtsp streaming server
[19:33:28] <sqwk> I am trying to attach an event to an element inside a label. It never fires as it always only moves the focus to the contained input. Any ideas? (Other than rewriting the html)
[19:33:31] <wad> greg5green, yeah, that's a downer. The only alternative I can think of, though, is to rewrite it in Javascipt. But with just one thread... ouch!
[19:33:32] <dblosevn> :-F
[19:33:35] <dblosevn> (D
[19:33:50] <greg5green> wad, maybe check how codeacademy deals with their console?
[19:34:02] <dblosevn> canvas :-)
[19:34:04] <greg5green> they have js and ruby and python programs
[19:34:13] <wad> dblosevn, see, that's the problem. That model doesn't scale. My server will die once I have a hundred people all running "goto 10" programs.
[19:34:15] <greg5green> idk how they did it
[19:34:41] <dblosevn> i didnt say it was feasible i said it would be cool
[19:35:01] <wad> dblosevn, how about the graphical output?
[19:35:19] <dblosevn> um... rtsp encode as h264
[19:35:43] <mouses_> do you guys use html snapshots?
[19:35:44] <dblosevn> make the frontend a video player
[19:35:57] <wad> dblosevn, what about input then?
[19:36:05] <dblosevn> jedi mind power?
[19:36:13] <dblosevn> or a text box would suffice
[19:36:27] <wad> Hard to write "Oregon Trail" when you're just watching a video of your program run...
[19:36:42] <dblosevn> oh forgot about user interaction
[19:37:00] <dblosevn> so rtmp and remote objects
[19:37:20] <dblosevn> only downside is flash
[19:37:36] <wad> Hmm.
[19:37:59] <dblosevn> red5 is free and pretty light weight
[19:38:00] <wad> I think, as a next step anyway, I'll just stick with the Java applet for the program execution and I/O. :)
[19:38:30] <dblosevn> and id almost bet you could use most of your java applet as your red5 app being its java too
[19:38:52] <wad> But I do need to write the web application around it. JQuery seems like the right choice. What should I do for the back end? I'm kinda new to this stuff. Can I use Java servlets running under Tomcat, or will that not talk with Ajax frontends?
[19:39:04] <wad> red5?
[19:39:06] * wad looks it up
[19:39:32] <dblosevn> any server sided engine can communicate via ajax, as long as it has a web frontend
[19:40:07] <wad> dblosevn, okay, cool. I don't have to redo the backend stuff then. :)
[19:40:11] <wad> Just the frontend.
[19:40:41] <dblosevn> i rememebr when i was like 15 i thought i invented something when i wrote a windows app the generated html and output it to a web server
[19:40:44] <wad> So, I use IntelliJ IDEA for my projects. Does that IDE work okay with JQuery?
[19:41:10] <dblosevn> pretty much any old text editer will suffice
[19:41:18] <mouses_> i just confirmed from using "Fetch as Google" in google webmaster tools that my js loaded content is not being indexed. My contact info and resume data are loaded on the server (php) and indexed, but the video gallery (that embeds youtube/vimeo) and photo gallery and bio are all loaded from js and not indexed
[19:41:28] <dblosevn> IntelliJ probally wont have code hints for jquery though
[19:41:56] <dblosevn> im not sure ive ever seen an ide that did though
[19:42:10] <wad> ok
[19:42:25] <mouses_> seems tedious to load initial thumbnails in php and then have to read those thumbs again in js and load the data about the thumbs into the larger video content and photo content areas
[19:43:12] <mouses_> i might change the bio data to be loaded in php though
[19:43:19] <mouses_> thats more searchable
[19:44:04] <dblosevn> well off to get drunk :-)
[19:44:07] <dblosevn> holla
[19:44:20] <wad> dblosevn, good luck
[19:45:16] <mouses_> my bio area has 7 chapters. each time i click a heading, ajax loads the content right now
[19:46:04] <mouses_> whats the best way to load all of this data in php and still be able to fade in/out the data content w/ jquery when the heading is clicked
[19:46:13] <muffinrecon> anyone know how to post input type name with ajax
[19:46:16] <muffinrecon> like
[19:46:21] <muffinrecon> my variables are set up
[19:46:35] <muffinrecon> var form_data = {
[19:46:35] <muffinrecon> 			username: $("#username").val(),
[19:46:35] <muffinrecon> 			password: $("#password").val(),
[19:46:35] <muffinrecon> 			type: $("input").attr("op"),
[19:46:35] <muffinrecon> 			is_ajax: 1
[19:46:55] <tw2113> mouses_, load it all and immediately hide with css
[19:47:00] <muffinrecon> and i want to post the value of
[19:47:00] <muffinrecon> <input type="hidden" name="op" value="login">
[19:47:17] <tw2113> use jQuery to show when needed
[19:47:21] <muffinrecon> how would I do the type: variable for ajax to post the value as well
[19:50:54] <mouses_> how come none of you guys are recommending that i use an html snapshot?
[19:51:15] <dblosevn_or_not> i hate being 2000 miles away from ym truck
[19:51:24] <tw2113> because i don't agree with loading every bit of initial content on your site via js
[19:51:42] <dblosevn_or_not> -ym +my
[19:52:04] <mouses_> it makes it easier to hold info about the content for later use
[19:52:04] <gf3> dblosevn't
[19:52:13] <dblosevn_or_not> lol
[19:52:37] <dblosevn_or_not> heard my client come home thought he was ready to go lol
[19:52:39] <mouses_> loading a video thumbnail and knowing the title of the video, description, duration, etc
[19:52:59] <mouses_> to pass that info to another section of the page when clicked
[19:53:29] <dblosevn_or_not> i usually render the page that was requested
[19:53:49] <dblosevn_or_not> all subsequent pages via ajax but i use hyperlinks to get there
[19:53:51] <muffinrecon> var form_data = {
[19:53:51] <muffinrecon> 			username: $("#username").val(),
[19:53:51] <muffinrecon> 			password: $("#password").val(),
[19:53:51] <muffinrecon> 			op: $("#type").val(),
[19:53:51] <muffinrecon> 			is_ajax: 1
[19:53:52] <muffinrecon> 		};
[19:53:56] <muffinrecon> am I doing this right?
[19:53:58] <muffinrecon> if I want to post
[19:54:01] <dblosevn_or_not> nope
[19:54:07] <muffinrecon> <input type="hidden" name="op" value="login" id="type">
[19:54:10] <dblosevn_or_not> cause floodings illegal
[19:54:21] <dblosevn_or_not> ?p @ muffinrecon
[19:54:21] <bot-t> muffinrecon, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:54:39] <muffinrecon> thx db
[19:54:39] <muffinrecon> sec
[19:56:30] <muffinrecon> http://jsfiddle.net/SudKy/1/
[19:56:33] <muffinrecon> how about this?
[19:56:49] <muffinrecon> i want to pass the op value with ajax
[19:58:59] <greg5green> on the surface, it looks fine
[19:59:04] <greg5green> but i didnt dig in or anything
[19:59:16] <muffinrecon> so the op value is passing?
[20:00:04] <greg5green> although, you prolly want to make your lick handler on 'submit' instead of 'click'
[20:00:34] <muffinrecon> k will do that
[20:00:43] <muffinrecon> it works now btw, had a problem with my response
[20:01:00] <greg5green> yes, it is posting your op
[20:01:03] <greg5green> and the other things
[20:01:14] <greg5green> your click*
[20:01:16] <dblosevn_or_not> muffinrecon: ya that works but i tend to write it a little more like this http://jsfiddle.net/Bpx4a/ :-)
[20:01:21] <dblosevn_or_not> no need for all the ids
[20:02:14] <tw2113> yeah, no need for IDs, we're all 21+ right?
[20:02:22] <muffinrecon> ahh
[20:02:30] <muffinrecon> much better
[20:02:32] <dblosevn_or_not> oops http://jsfiddle.net/Bpx4a/1/
[20:02:41] <dblosevn_or_not> missed a }
[20:03:16] <muffinrecon> so i assume .extend grabs everything and adds is_ajax to it?
[20:03:31] <greg5green> dblosevn_or_not, your way is better
[20:03:54] <muffinrecon> oh nvrmind
[20:03:55] <dblosevn_or_not> .extend combines 2 objects together
[20:03:58] <muffinrecon> its serialze
[20:04:13] <greg5green> although, the <button> tag needs to be made an <input type submit> tag
[20:04:20] <dblosevn_or_not> an object is returned from serialize and i combine it with another object
[20:04:50] <muffinrecon> tearing my hard work to shreds guys :)
[20:04:50] <dblosevn_or_not> greg5green: yes your right although lately i have noticed if theres only one button in a form it is a submit
[20:04:54] <muffinrecon> thnxs for the suggestions
[20:05:34] <dblosevn_or_not> i wracked my brains earlier tying to figure out why my button with no handerlers was adding a # to the url
[20:05:47] <greg5green> dblosevn_or_not, it might work if its a button, but its not right
[20:05:49] <greg5green> :>
[20:05:52] <dblosevn_or_not> turned out i needed <button type="button"
[20:06:08] <dblosevn_or_not> which i thought was rediculus
[20:06:26] <mouses_> so none of you guys use html snapshots?
[20:06:39] <greg5green> ive never even heard of that
[20:07:16] <dblosevn_or_not> as i said eariler most all of my mainly js/ajax driven sites, have proper navigation and at least the content will load without js even if its not pretty
[20:07:17] <mouses_> it lets google index your ajax loaded content by using !#
[20:08:58] <greg5green> what makes you think it would load any of the content you have ajaxed in?
[20:09:05] <dblosevn_or_not> me?
[20:09:10] <greg5green> no, mouses_
[20:09:16] <mouses_> because it's designed to index it
[20:09:20] <greg5green> dblosevn_or_not, you're doing it right
[20:09:44] <greg5green> mouses_, either google can run scripts, which they are doing now allegedly, or they cant
[20:10:27] <mouses_> https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/learn-more
[20:10:43] <tw2113> just load some fucking static content and change it out afterwards damn it
[20:10:44] <tw2113> :D
[20:11:22] <greg5green> mouses_, that page isnt up to date
[20:11:35] <tw2113> 1 year old
[20:11:38] <greg5green> also, you are in here talking about a js plugin i think
[20:11:39] <greg5green> lol
[20:11:52] <mouses_> dude you are making shit up
[20:12:11] <greg5green> i said "i think"
[20:12:19] <mouses_> lol at least read it before making up stuff
[20:12:24] <greg5green> i dont care enough to scroll through hours of logs to figure out anything else you said
[20:13:12] <greg5green> i tried to lookup your term "html snapshots"
[20:13:15] <greg5green> nothing ever came up
[20:13:26] <greg5green> you post a link about how google doesnt believe in ajax
[20:13:31] <greg5green> yet, they do know
[20:13:31] <mouses_> lol check your internet connection
[20:13:35] <greg5green> they do now
[20:13:49] <greg5green> ***
[20:14:08] <mouses_> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22html+snapshots%22
[20:14:28] <greg5green> oh you're right
[20:14:32] <greg5green> im a fucking idiot and can't google shit
[20:14:35] <mouses_> you trolling me bro?
[20:14:35] <tw2113> meh too many extra steps
[20:14:36] <greg5green> fuck off
[20:16:38] <dblosevn_or_not> hostility damn lol
[20:16:41] <mouses_> http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=174992   <-- updated 10/16/12... less than 4 months ago
[20:17:53] <mouses_> and you have provided no info about google indexing ajax now by default
[20:18:00] <greg5green> I could tell you useful information or I could tell you to go fuck yourself
[20:18:59] <mouses_> dude, you said you've never heard of html snapshots and then you stated false info about google's indexing abilities
[20:19:00] <tw2113> it's not hard to fade in content that's hidden via css
[20:19:05] <tw2113> seriously
[20:19:28] <tw2113> and that way you get your fancy fade in effect without having to use ajax to even load it
[20:19:31] <greg5green> mouses_, google can now run scripts
[20:19:38] <greg5green> and does run scripts
[20:19:44] <greg5green> they might not have updated their info, but its true
[20:19:53] <mouses_> prove it bro
[20:20:13] <greg5green> how bout i don't becuase you are the one here asking for advice
[20:20:26] <mouses_> lol, no need to be rude man
[20:20:31] <greg5green> BEST PART: even if they didn't, NONE OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH JQUERY
[20:20:33] <mouses_> i come to talk jquery
[20:20:34] <greg5green> NONE
[20:20:47] <dblosevn_away> mouses_: google does a pretty good job of indexing it self and almost all the google sites are ajax or generated with js
[20:20:48] <greg5green> NOT ONE SINGLE BIT
[20:21:09] <dblosevn_away> think thats pretty much proof enough
[20:22:32] <mouses_> dblosevn_away: google indexes ajax through html snapshots
[20:22:52] <mouses_> which goes back to my original question of whether you guys use them
[20:22:57] <dblosevn_away> ?g site:google.com
[20:22:58] <b-ot> dblosevn_away: Google News → https://news.google.com/
[20:22:59] <tw2113> who cares if we do
[20:23:03] <greg5green> then why arent you in the #htmlsnapshot channel?
[20:23:03] <tw2113> if you want to, go for it
[20:23:19] <dblosevn_away> view source on that
[20:23:26] <dblosevn_away> theres not a lick of html
[20:23:30] <greg5green> actually
[20:23:35] <greg5green> gimme two minutes
[20:23:43] <greg5green> i think the article im going to find is going to be over your head
[20:23:44] <greg5green> but
[20:23:52] <tw2113> i see divs and anchors and links dblosevn_away
[20:23:52] <greg5green> it exactly answers your question
[20:24:49] <greg5green> http://nerds.airbnb.com/weve-launched-our-first-nodejs-app-to-product
[20:24:51] <greg5green> there you go
[20:25:05] <greg5green> it is exactly what you are asking about mouses
[20:25:07] <greg5green> they use it
[20:25:53] <greg5green> for future reference, asking in #jquery about something has nothing to do with jquery won't get you the answer you want
[20:26:22] <greg5green> something that has***
[20:27:36] <mouses_> greg5green: that page content is not generated through ajax
[20:27:42] <mouses_> please try again, k thx
[20:27:48] <greg5green> why dont you read the fucking article
[20:27:57] <tw2113> just use htmlsnapshots and get it over with
[20:28:39] <greg5green> i was about to apologize for being an asshole to you earlier
[20:28:43] <greg5green> but nah, not anymore
[20:29:22] <mouses_> what is the point of what you posted bro
[20:29:27] <greg5green> READ IT
[20:29:34] <greg5green> ITS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
[20:29:43] <greg5green> THIS ELUSIVE "HTML SNAPSHOT"
[20:30:26] <mouses_> the word snapshot is nowhere on that page
[20:30:35] <greg5green> im going to /ignore you
[20:30:47] <greg5green> since you lack critical thinking skills in the slightest
[20:30:49] <greg5green> have a nice life
[20:31:04] <mouses_> no need for being rude dude
[21:34:56] <Raja_> hi
[21:57:19] <nesoi> hey how do I hide a page until I want to show it?
[21:58:02] <entrada> $('body').hide()
[21:58:56] <nesoi> entrada : thanks... I want it to start out hidden though, so it won't show up and then go away suddenly
[21:59:15] <entrada> add a class called hidden or something to the body
[21:59:28] <entrada> remove it when you want to show
[21:59:38] <entrada> .hidden { display: none; }
[22:00:52] <nesoi> can I add that to the page div? (jqm)
[22:02:38] <nesoi> entrada : not sure exactly how to do that
[22:02:48] <entrada> sure
[22:02:51] <limpc> i have 2 hidden fields and 1 visible field on a form (<form id="frmAlbum">) .. when I do $("#frmAlbum").serialize(), I see the 2 hidden fields in the serialized string. but the visible field is not. The visible field has both and ID and a name.
[22:02:55] <limpc> why is it not showing up?
[22:03:32] <entrada> limpc: do they all have different names?
[22:03:49] <limpc> yes they do
[22:04:05] <limpc> 'aname', 'pid', and 'cca19b12f'
[22:04:09] <entrada> nesoi: add the class to whatever element you want to. the technique remains the same
[22:04:41] <entrada> limpc: gist your code, please.
[22:05:09] <limpc> gist?
