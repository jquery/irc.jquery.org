[00:00:22] <Paveloosha> Hi.. how to remove a css property?
[00:00:58] <Paveloosha> do" bottom:none" works?
[00:03:54] <Paveloosha> any one?
[00:04:55] <dr0id> bottom: 0;
[00:08:48] <Paveloosha> @<dr0id>, if I put "bottom:0", its fixing it to '0' all the time. I need to completly remove it..

[00:24:57] <yan_nick> hey guys
[00:25:10] <yan_nick> how can i check whether an <audio> is playing?
[00:26:15] <coldhead> hold your ear up to the speakers?
[00:26:28] <yan_nick> coldhead: ;)
[00:26:33] <yan_nick> coldhead: u know what i mean
[00:27:08] <yan_nick> coldhead: if you click on a play button it should play and if you click second time i need a pause button
[00:28:37] <coldhead> yan_nick: http://neutroncreations.com/blog/building-a-custom-html5-audio-player-with-jquery/
[00:28:55] <coldhead> if you look there you'll see there are various ways to do it
[00:29:05] <coldhead> that differ between browsers
[00:29:14] <coldhead> they just toggle between play and pause
[00:29:22] <coldhead> in their example
[00:29:27] <coldhead> and don't actually seem to detect it
[00:29:51] <yan_nick> audio. paused aaah!
[00:29:56] <yan_nick> coldhead <3
[00:29:58] <yan_nick> coldhead++
[00:29:58] <coldhead> they have some good further resources anyway
[00:30:07] <coldhead> thank YOU, yan_nick
[00:30:13] <coldhead> and good luck

[00:45:54] <jeroenem> How can i change the src from an iframe by click a button? Like: click button open, add http://www.youtube.com/embed/18sd. Clicking close, remove http://www.youtube.com/embed/18sd from the src
[00:47:14] <pomodoro> jeroenem: look up attr and load methods
[00:47:41] <pomodoro> jeroenem: for the click look up events or the click method
[00:48:40] <eirikb> Hello. I want to select td in a table based on the th (same index), is this possible in one slector? I can easily do $('td').filter(function(){return $('th:eq(' + $(this).index() ')');}); but that does not look very nice
[00:51:39] <juria_roberts> Heyy how do i select the body of an iframe and change its css?
[00:51:49] <juria_roberts> the iframe is same domain
[00:57:02] <juria_roberts> why didn't this work?
[00:57:03] <juria_roberts> $("#preview_page").contents().find("body").css("scrollbar-face-color","#000000")
[00:57:19] <juria_roberts> where preview_page is the id of the iframe
[00:58:51] <juria_roberts> anybody there or is my net connection not working?
[00:59:03] <coldhead> its working, baby
[00:59:47] <juria_roberts> coldhead: ok coolhead
[01:00:56] <jeroenem> thanks pomodoro, got it fixed :)
[01:05:16] <juria_roberts> any1?
[01:06:13] <pomodoro> juria_roberts: there should be just one body
[01:06:21] <pomodoro> so $('body') should be enough
[01:06:34] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: ok
[01:06:38] <pomodoro> about the css statement
[01:06:44] <juria_roberts> but it still should have worked
[01:06:50] <EDK> hey guys... just a little bug what am i having ,... while playing a video on the div frame on it ... http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[01:06:52] <pomodoro> i don't know, you'd have to work
[01:07:00] <pomodoro> and why use contents()
[01:07:09] <EDK> if you go to the 4th thumb ... there is a video...
[01:07:28] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: putting something like ("font-style","italic:) worked
[01:07:35] <pomodoro> sorry, i meant the css you'd have to google
[01:07:44] <pomodoro> yes then its the css
[01:08:00] <pomodoro> scrollbar face color prob isnt a official css thing
[01:08:12] <dr0id> Paveloosha: did you find any solution ?
[01:08:18] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: i did but google showed be scrollbar-face-color only?
[01:08:24] <juria_roberts> *me
[01:08:48] <pomodoro> isnt that browser specific?
[01:08:58] <pomodoro> like -webkit-scrollbar ... etc
[01:09:27] <dr0id> Paveloosha: you could set top: 0; with some height
[01:09:40] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: ur right just found out that firefox does not support it
[01:09:42] <dr0id> not a good solution anyway
[01:10:07] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: only ie and opera support it
[01:10:21] <pomodoro> ah k
[01:31:35] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: heyy i just found out abot jscrollpane
[01:32:08] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: but i have to put the script tags inside the page being loaded in the iframe
[01:32:23] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: can i do this dynamically through javascript?
[01:32:38] <pomodoro> is it cross-domain?
[01:33:05] <pomodoro> that probably wont work
[01:33:08] <pomodoro> other wise u can
[01:33:29] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: know not cross domain
[01:34:18] <pomodoro> then u can edit the iframe document
[01:34:32] <[2]bob> Hi, i've got an array like that : ( array[0] => id,223  array[1] => id,224 ), I want array[0] to be id and array[1] 223, I tried to use map with return [value.split(',')] but it doesn't work, what am I doing wrong ?
[01:36:48] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: but will the script tages included through javascript work?
[01:37:12] <pomodoro> are the already in the iframe?
[01:37:15] <pomodoro> then they wil
[01:37:19] <pomodoro> on the iframe page
[01:37:33] <pomodoro> if u need u can find the parent frame as well
[01:38:03] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: no they do not exist when the page is initially loaded
[01:38:27] <pomodoro> get the iframe document form the parent document and append
[01:38:27] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: and jscrollpane site said that it has to be included inside the page being loaded in the iframe
[01:41:38] <pomodoro> juria_roberts: this scrollbar is also very cool: http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4
[01:42:56] <juria_roberts> pomodoro: thanks will have a look
[01:45:33] <pom> I read the Expire header set at http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5/jquery.min.js as in the past. Is this an error?
[01:57:56] <coldhead> that does sound wrong, pom, but i assume google know what they're doing
[01:58:29] <coldhead> paul_irish has the keys to that feature and he's forgotten more than i'll ever know
[01:59:51] <pom> coldhead: Don't assume that. For the whole of google it only takes one guy to make a simple typo to create this error, if it is. =)
[02:00:30] <coldhead> i will gladly assume paul wouldn't make that error
[02:00:43] <coldhead> the cache stuff in html5 boilerplate is right on the money
[02:00:51] <vladyn> hey guys - looking for blink plug in

[02:03:22] <Paveloosha> @dr0id, I am not able to find it yet.. I tried a lot but didnt found any solution.... for them question is unknown, "Is there any way to remove a css property as we can remove "attribute" ?
[02:16:45] <Aamir> gym_jane: hi
[02:16:50] <Aamir> sorry missed ur msg
[02:19:08] <pr0ton> how do i write classes in javascript?
[02:19:14] <pr0ton> i mean,i need to reuse a lot of code
[02:19:20] <pr0ton> dont want to just tie it all together using functions
[02:23:47] <magnus_> hey. im using jquery UI (1.8.14) and im having problems loading content into my Tabs. It just fails to load and triggers the ajax Error handler. When I mouse-over the tabs, it hints that it will load <my-file>#ui-tabs-1 .. when my markup specifies that it should load an actual html file, which I find weird. Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/B6D6r3tE
[02:24:14] <joeytwiddle> pr0ton: OOPS in JS looks horrid.  http://phrogz.net/js/classes/OOPinJS.html
[02:25:16] <sunmao> Hi! I have go a problem. I have got an selector and I am using on this selector the click() this way: function $( ".booked" ).click(function() { ..... }); The problem is some times I remove this class from the elements sometimes i am adding it. But the js not able to recognise this. If I remove the booked class and I click to the element the click() event still fires
[02:26:14] <joeytwiddle> you could have your function check the element's className to see if it's been removed
[02:26:45] <sunmao> Another issue there is a function which sets this booked class this function is using ajax request. And when I click to this booked class element the click event not fires. My guess is it's not able to recognize that the class changed from sg else to booked.
[02:27:21] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: ofcourse it's removed I can see in firebug
[02:27:34] <joeytwiddle> lol
[02:27:39] <joeytwiddle> i mean to fix your problem
[02:27:49] <joeytwiddle> the function can check, and then decide whether to run or not :P
[02:29:03] <sunmao> but this: $( ".booked" ).click(function() { ..... }); does the same. It checks "if the clicked element contains booked class then and i do sg.."
[02:35:08] <toxz> any idea how to format a number with a leading 0 automatically if its lower than 9? - maybe with parseInt or another function...
[02:35:58] <lunks> Hi, how to use jquery template on an external file?
[02:36:36] <lunks> other than <script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" src="template.tmpl" />
[02:37:00] <lunks> jQuery tries to execute it if I does that and gives me an error while parsing the HTML inside it.
[02:40:40] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: thanks for the tipp
[02:41:27] <Iszak> Hello #jquery how is everyone today?
[02:41:31] <joeytwiddle> sunmao: i think $(".booked") means "select all .booked elements" and .click() means "add this function to all selected"
[02:41:46] <joeytwiddle> so .click() in fact knows nothing about ".booked"
[02:41:59] <joeytwiddle> it just gets a list of elements to add your event handler to
[02:45:13] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: yeah i changed to this: $( "td" ).click(function() { if($(this).hasClass(booked))  });
[02:45:43] <joeytwiddle> sweet
[02:47:12] <rahmen> Can someone check why this fancybox script doesn't work? http://pastie.org/2217009 There's code, explanation and questions in there. The main goal is to make fancybox display a page without errors. And the reason it's not working could be something with DOM. Read link :]
[02:47:22] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: if you understand well your thinking then if have got 10 element which has got booked class and i do this: $(".booked").click(function() { alert("fired")  }); then i get this message 10 times?
[02:47:50] <joeytwiddle> well, if you click all 10 of them, yes :P
[02:48:04] <sunmao> :D:D
[02:48:10] <sunmao> jsut one of them
[02:48:12] <sunmao> one time
[02:49:33] <sunmao> ahh
[02:49:39] <sunmao> maybe I understand now
[02:50:28] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: "i think $(".booked") means "select all .booked elements" and .click() means "add this function to all selected"" and if i added this elements to the event handler those will be always there it does not matter if i remove the class
[02:50:36] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: am i right?
[02:57:24] <sunmao> joeytwiddle: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F exactly this
[03:07:03] <juria_roberts> does load allow me to put a throbber while the data is being fetched
[03:07:08] <juria_roberts> ?
[03:07:22] <juria_roberts> i can only see the complete function
[03:07:30] <jeedey> does getJSON pass the data evenif the server response return the JSON with a 404 or 500?
[03:08:57] <juria_roberts> jeedeey:u talkin to me?
[03:09:26] <jeedey> anyone with the answer XD
[03:09:49] <juria_roberts> jeedey: ohh u asked a question soz
[03:11:16] <RobertV> i have setInterval() going; any ideas how to stop it after N times?
[03:11:39] <RobertV> i know it's clearinterval(), but i'm not sure about the strategy
[03:12:23] <jeedey> RobertV, everytime the function executes or code, just +1 to i, when i is equal to 10, clearInterval?
[03:12:49] <RobertV> but how do you get the timer handle inside the function?
[03:13:05] <jeedey> set is as a global or pass it?
[03:13:12] <jeedey> like when you use setInterval, assign it to a variable
[03:13:16] <RobertV> ah, yeah
[03:13:18] <jeedey> var timer = setInterval()
[03:13:28] <RobertV> thanks. (i'm dumb!)
[03:13:34] <qom> I want to append this: http://pastebin.com/ugwCPv3M to a div, what's the easiest and most correct way?
[03:13:43] <jeedey> RobertV, no probs
[03:13:59] <Anticom> hi all
[03:18:27] <sunmao> Re! I have got problem, in firefox when I click to a td element and I change the class (background color) with animation in the last couple millisecs i see a "flash" http://jsfiddle.net/kFV2h/ Does anybody now why?
[03:19:30] <Anticom> does jquery offer some native browser-detection?
[03:19:45] <RobertV> jeedey: var timer = setInterval(func, interval)   // how do i get timer into func()?
[03:20:12] <juria_roberts> Anticom: jQuery.browser
[03:20:32] <jeedey> func(timer)?
[03:20:53] <Anticom> juria_roberts thanks (:
[03:21:09] <juria_roberts> Anticom: np
[03:21:59] <RobertV> you have to pass parameters through setInterval, but timer doesn't exist at that point
[03:23:16] <sunmao> anybody?
[03:23:17] <Zol> I have an unordered list with lots of li's (24 of them) that contain a div with an image element. I'd like to split the li's in half and put the second half on the left side of the first li. I don't want to just change their css position, but also their position in the DOM. How can I use .each() to do this, or is there a better way?
[03:23:50] <coldhead> pom: paul irish is google's chrome evangelist, developer of a lot of html5 + js goodness and the beating heart and soul of #jQuery
[03:23:58] <coldhead> also he's totaly dreamy
[03:26:48] <sunmao> in firefox when I click to a td element and I change the class (background color) with animation in the last couple millisecs i see a "flash" http://jsfiddle.net/kFV2h/ Does anybody now why?
[03:28:43] <coldhead> sunmao: table cells hate being animated
[03:29:00] <coldhead> i think because they have weird display: properties
[03:29:04] <coldhead> not like other elements
[03:29:16] <coldhead> the best bet is to animate something within the td
[03:29:20] <coldhead> not the td itself
[03:30:15] <nail_> Zol: maybe something like $lis = $('#your-ul li'); $tomove = $lis.find(':gt(' + Math.round($lis.length) / 2 + ')'); then do whatever you want with $tomove
[03:31:30] <coldhead> my advice doesn't seem to help in this instance >: |
[03:32:30] <Zol> nail_: What does the :gt() thing?
[03:32:54] <nail_> it selects all elements with an index greater than the param in the given set
[03:32:56] <Zol> shouldn't it be Math.round($lis.length / 2) as well?
[03:33:00] <sunmao> coldhead: thanks
[03:33:09] <nail_> err yes, sorry :)
[03:33:42] <Zol> nail_: I'll test it out! Thanks
[03:33:57] <nail_> welcome
[03:34:30] <lanmower> is there a way to do a find that includes the item itself?
[03:34:34] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is there any way to remove css property!!
[03:35:27] <coldhead> sunmao: also you need to tell removeClass which class to remove
[03:35:44] <sunmao> coldhead: i want to remove all classs :)
[03:36:06] <coldhead> ?removeattr
[03:36:17] <coldhead> .attr('class', '')
[03:36:59] <gma> Zol: I was wondering if something like this might do it: $('ul li:nth-child(n+13)').detach().prependTo('ul');
[03:37:03] <gma> Zol: untested, mind you
[03:37:10] <coldhead> there IS a removeattr() -- removeattr('class'')
[03:37:58] <Zol> gma: Will test that too
[03:38:07] <Paveloosha> @<lanmower>, good question?
[03:38:18] <richardjprice> hello, if someone clicks on a td in a tr, what would be a good way of finding out what n child the td is?
[03:38:22] <sunmao> coldhead: why i could not use removCall with out parameter to remove all class attr?
[03:38:28] <Paveloosha> sorry *? *.
[03:39:28] <coldhead> does that work, sunmao ?
[03:39:39] <coldhead> sorry, it's my first day
[03:39:50] <sunmao> http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ it should :)
[03:40:01] <sunmao> Example: Remove all the classes from the matched elements. and he calls wo params
[03:40:47] <Paveloosha> @<lanmower>, may be a tricki way... $('mySelf').parent().find('mySelf') ....... :)
[03:41:11] <pr0ton> i'm getting this error in the chrome debugger
[03:41:12] <pr0ton> Error in event handler for 'undefined': SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[03:41:14] <pr0ton> i dont know what it is
[03:41:29] <pr0ton> basically it happens when a .change function on an text input field must be fired
[03:41:34] <pr0ton> i dontk now why this is happenning, any idea?
[03:41:42] <coldhead> me so sorry, sunmao
[03:42:10] <lanmower> paveloosha, no thats a very bad idea, what If I'm on the root element?
[03:42:19] <lanmower> I did find help though.http://danielnouri.org/notes/2011/03/14/a-jquery-find-that-also-finds-the-root-element/
[03:45:07] <Paveloosha> I know this is a bad idea .. :)
[03:46:13] <mydoghasworms> I have a problem with a piece of JSON containing a float number of 0000000000000000E+00 (essentially zero). When you look at this fiddle, it works: http://jsfiddle.net/Gr6fq/. The same snippet of JSON taken from there and pasted in JSONLint does not work. Neither does it work in FireFox on Windows using jQuery 1.5.2.
[03:46:36] <sunmao> coldhead: np
[03:47:21] <Paveloosha> <lanmower>, checked it.. there is a bypass way in any case..
[03:47:53] <whateverb> I used ajax send mail tutorial here: http://tinyurl.com/ajaxjqueryform  But when I press Enter in text-area e.g message field, then it cannot send mail,, can somebody help :(
[03:48:06] <whateverb> Do I need to do something with message variable befores sending?
[03:48:55] <whateverb> I mean if Enter is pressed in message field text and then I press Send, it cannot send
[03:49:19] <lanmower> what is the correct mimetype to use for json?
[03:49:33] <lanmower> text/javascript make internet explorer offer me the file as a download...
[03:49:52] <lanmower> other ones break firefox
[03:50:08] <Po0dle> application/json
[03:50:47] <Po0dle> How do I maintain $_SESSION data when I do an ajax request?
[03:57:12] <whateverb> I think in my problem keyword is .serialize()
[04:02:33] <blaa> how can I call validate() method for a form inside a modal?
[04:04:14] <lanmower> internet explorer is telling me do you want to save (on my json responses)
[04:04:32] <k1t> this might be a silly question but can you change JS variables in Firebug? For example, say I'm making a JSONP call and the data URL has variables in it, could the user change those variables?
[04:04:53] <Fox`> e.preventDefault(); doesn't seem to work when the url has a # tag in the url. any reason why?
[04:04:57] <lanmower> k1t yes you can I think
[04:05:09] <lanmower> use breakpoints
[04:05:46] <lanmower> /m2m/music2media/almcms/file/upload?id=5	POST	200	application/json
[04:05:58] <timing> Fox`: that should prevent the default too
[04:06:12] <k1t> lanmower: so it could be a potential security risk?
[04:06:24] <Engina> could $(document).ready not fire in case of a broken DOM ?
[04:06:53] <lanmower> Fox, you must bare in mind that you're working with different events on the # changes.
[04:07:15] <k1t> Lampoon: if you view the JSONP call @ the bottom of http://facebook.devoodle.com/ 's source code, you can see the data URL im talking about
[04:07:25] <lanmower> k1t java is client side code, nothing that touches your security should be client side, thats server side.
[04:07:41] <Po0dle> How do I maintain $_SESSION data over an ajax request?
[04:08:25] <whateverb> how do I serialize "var text = $("#text").val();" ?
[04:08:30] <lanmower> javascript is for display logic.
[04:08:34] <lanmower> mainly
[04:08:40] <coldhead> blaa: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/valid
[04:09:33] <Po0dle> Ah I think I got it :D
[04:10:36] <blaa> coldhead hmm, should be $('form').live('submit', function(){ $(this).valid() }); ?
[04:10:51] <Fox`> timing: but if my url is example.com/index.html#thing and i'm using links pointing to other # anchors on the page while e.preventDefault(); is in effect it still uses the default method
[04:11:17] <coldhead> blaa: i think you might need to do $(this).validate(); first
[04:11:37] <blaa> coldhead I will try, thank you
[04:13:10] <Anticom> where can i find a good resource to write an own jq plugin?
[04:13:20] <nahuel> Hi, does someone use jquery datatable editable ?
[04:13:20] <k1t> lanmower: hmm let me explain more explicitly what im trying to do.. I signin with facebook/twitter, the callback will assign variables, change the data url (to include their facebook/twitter id), then make the jsonp call
[04:13:34] <k1t> and i wanna make sure the user cant just put any ol ID in there
[04:13:39] <coldhead> Anticom: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring

[04:13:49] <Anticom> coldhead thx
[04:14:56] <juha___> coldhead: come to finland and buy me lunch now
[04:15:47] <lanmower> then do a server side check against his stored username
[04:15:53] <Paveloosha> Hi, I am searching it till morning.. is there any way to remove css property??
[04:16:19] <coldhead> juha___: I HAVE A NEW WATCH FROM FINLAND
[04:16:44] <coldhead> suunto
[04:16:46] <lanmower> k1t: its important to remember what is server side and what is client side, you're client should never talk to any other servers but your own, and your server should be the portal to any information it receives, be it remote or not.
[04:16:55] <coldhead> Paveloosha: you can't :(
[04:16:59] <lanmower> note the should.
[04:17:04] <lanmower> there are exceptions.
[04:17:25] <Paveloosha> :(
[04:17:33] <coldhead> lanmower, YOU'RE AN EXCEPTION
[04:17:38] <coldhead> al fellow
[04:17:57] <lanmower> hi coldhead :)
[04:18:01] <Prometheus> coldhead: congrats on the Suunto watch =P
[04:18:01] <lanmower> wanna help me debug an ie problem?
[04:18:25] <k1t> lanmower: right..
[04:18:30] <k1t> lanmower: makes sense
[04:19:30] <rahmen> Can someone check why this fancybox script doesn't work? http://pastie.org/2217009 There's code, explanation and questions in there. The main goal is to make fancybox display a page without errors. And the reason it's not working could be something with DOM. Read link :]
[04:19:32] <juha___> coldhead: you know, suunto gives (or actually in your case, doesn't give) aids
[04:21:43] <J4M35> hi there.
[04:22:48] <Anticom> coldhead is there a way to add event handlers to my plugin?
[04:22:49] <Paveloosha> Is there any way to add same type listener to "parent" and "childe" ? (inspired from another asker) :)
[04:22:53] <ckoekemoer> hey guy's, i'm looking for a way to retrieve the amount of degrees i've  rotated a div, ie: if ($(this).css(rotate) = 40) {
[04:23:07] <Anticom> sorry, found it ^_^
[04:23:59] <Paveloosha> it can be done in AS3..
[04:24:13] <whateverb> If I change class with jquery and want to put a hover function on new class, how it would be done?
[04:25:28] <Paveloosha> @<whateverb>, you are appending or rmoving old calss?
[04:25:47] <whateverb> add new and remove old
[04:25:52] <lanmower> I'm having headaches with ie and json.
[04:26:06] <ckoekemoer> whateverb  should be something like this $('.newclass').hover( stuff you wanna do)
[04:26:07] <lanmower> ie tries to download application/json and text/javascript
[04:26:21] <lanmower> text/plain doesnt get downloaded but it gets html encoded.
[04:26:33] <Paveloosha> @<whateverb>, did you tried to add listener again?
[04:27:34] <whateverb> I'll pastebin
[04:27:57] <Anticom> hmm think i didn't quite got it
[04:28:32] <Paveloosha> @<whateverb>, ??
[04:28:33] <Anticom> i'm having an input type text appended to the selected elements, when the plugin is called, now i want to perform an action on .keyup()
[04:28:40] <Anticom> can i integrate that in my plugin somehow?
[04:30:34] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/2uBi8Pz8
[04:30:43] <Anticom> that's how far i got now
[04:31:09] <mipo> hi
[04:31:12] <mipo> how to make append with effect?
[04:31:20] <mipo> fade effect
[04:31:30] <Paveloosha> @<Anticom>, $('ele').myPlugin.public FunctionKey()... try like this.. (not tested)
[04:31:50] <whateverb> Paveloosha : http://pastebin.com/p0EfVbCD    I have a div with id divid and I want to change classes on click there...but jquery doesn't recognize .newclass
[04:31:54] <coldhead> What a horrible loutish planet this is. The dominant species consists of sadistic morons, faces bearing the hideous lineaments of spiritual famine swollen with stupid hate. Hopeless rubbish.
[04:33:22] <phryk> coldhead: If you hope to find something different in here, you are retarded.
[04:33:24] <guitobon> Hi. Where is the rigth place to ask a question about the jquery homepage?
[04:33:34] <joeytwiddle> coldhead: speak for yourself
[04:33:55] <joeytwiddle> pretty unfair to generalise about people you haven't met
[04:34:22] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[04:34:31] <coldhead> those aren't my words, i was just putting it out there
[04:34:47] <Paveloosha> @<whateverb>, ithink you are doing it wrong way.. you may need to add next listener within first eventHandler..
[04:34:48] <coldhead> grandpa's diary :(
[04:35:20] <Anticom> whateverb try .live('click', function() {...
[04:35:34] <joeytwiddle> heh
[04:35:53] <Paveloosha> ha ha ha .. ColdHead ..
[04:36:36] <whateverb> :)
[04:36:47] <whateverb> thanks Anticom, I had forgotten that
[04:37:47] <Paveloosha> <whateverb> ,Anticom is right
[04:38:13] <Paveloosha> I forgotted too.. thanks anticom
[04:39:18] <rahmen> Hi! I'm trying to make a fancybox popup with ajax. The links are generated with js and then fancybox is added to the elements. When clicked it tries to load but fails. If I use iframe it works perfect. But I don't want an iframe. What's the difference?
[04:39:53] <impi> heya guys, and girls, i can do quite a bit with jquery, but have never really delved into it nice and deep, lately i have had to so some new things like join arrays, remove values from arrays, form objects, and i was using console.dir(var) to debug, but sometimes i feel quite lost, is there a nice guide you can point me to that will show me how i can, for example, debug jQuery(this) and find out what methods i can use, and say this is an a
[04:39:54] <impi> nchor, find out what elements i can get from this.href this,text those kind of things?
[04:41:45] <rahmen> impi: I use firebug and console.log(var) but maybe that's the same as console.dir(var)?
[04:42:28] <impi> rahmen, hey, well console.dir() is for objects..i guess, but then it has these millions of folders underneath it..and im not sure how to get access to those variables
[04:43:08] <rahmen> do you use firebug?
[04:43:17] <impi> rahmen, yes,
[04:43:36] <rahmen> oki :P then I can't help you any more :P
[04:43:43] <impi> hehe
[04:44:34] <impi> no worries, ill search around and read a few posts, thanks anyhow
[04:45:41] <guitobon> Please, anybody could tell me if Are there any Forum about the jquery homepage?
[04:48:56] <nahuel> no one use jquery-datatable-editable? What do you use ?
[04:49:42] <mipo> how to get last div tag in a table?
[04:50:10] <fuchstronaut> $('table').find('div').last()
[04:50:23] <lanmower> I'm having a problem with ie, its html encoding my json (which wreaks havoc on my json that contains html), any ideas how I can resolve this?
[04:52:01] <mipo> fuchstronaut  Thanks you!
[04:52:08] <ckoekemoer> hey guy's, i'm looking for a way to retrieve the amount of degrees i've  rotated a div, ie: if ($(this).css(rotate) = 40) {
[04:52:09] <mipo> Thank you!
[04:52:33] <coachz> is there a way to "lock" my thickbox during a submit so a user doesn't click submit twice ?
[04:53:01] <coachz> i have a form in the thickbox
[04:53:55] <pr0ton> coachz, you can disable the input
[04:54:12] <coachz> how please ?
[04:54:40] <pr0ton> $('#submitButton).attr('disabled', 'true');
[04:54:47] <pr0ton> do this during the onclick
[04:54:57] <coachz> thanks !
[04:55:00] <pr0ton> and after you've finished doing whatever se the disabled to true
[04:55:05] <pr0ton> just check the attr syntax
[04:55:07] <coachz> i think that's a great idea
[04:55:12] <pr0ton> basically you've to set the 'disabled' to true
[04:55:20] <pr0ton> and to enable, set it to false
[04:55:41] <coachz> thanks a lot
[04:56:30] <pr0ton> np
[05:04:49] <lanmower> recommendations for a good file uploader?
[05:10:23] <coachz> pr0ton,  that worked great.  thanks !!!!
[05:13:42] <mipo> fuchstronaut , I am using append
[05:13:48] <mipo> but can't find!
[05:14:05] <fuchstronaut> hm
[05:14:20] <fuchstronaut> you'r sure you ment me?
[05:14:31] <mipo> yes
[05:14:33] <lanmower> any reccomendations for a file uploader?
[05:14:47] <mipo> you says me : $('div').find('table').last()
[05:15:01] <fuchstronaut> ah right ye
[05:15:16] <fuchstronaut> well what are you trying to do again?
[05:15:26] <fuchstronaut> wasnt it to find the last div-element inside a table?
[05:15:34] <__machine> is it possible to override/extend an existing JS function like this? var old_xyz = xyz; function xyz() { ...; old_xyz(); } ?
[05:15:54] <fuchstronaut> if yes, it should be $('table).find('div').last()
[05:16:09] <fuchstronaut> (__machine): like this you are calling the function recursivly
[05:16:10] <mipo> I have a div tag  , that have timer for getting last data from database
[05:16:38] <mipo> I want went that find new content , last div load with effect
[05:16:40] <__machine> fuchstronaut: how can i tack on some extra code to an existing function?
[05:16:45] <mipo> similar fadeIn
[05:17:03] <fuchstronaut> (__machine): you cant if you cant edit the function itself
[05:17:28] <mipo> No 'went' , I mean when
[05:18:14] <__machine> fuchstronaut: so assigning xyz to old_xyz … then redefining xyz … it has redefined old_xyz as well?
[05:18:21] <fuchstronaut> i still didnt got it, sorry. $('table').find('div') will return you all div's inside of table
[05:18:26] <fuchstronaut> .last() is simply return the last one
[05:18:27] <mipo> fuchstronaut , are you understand?
[05:18:52] <fuchstronaut> (__machine): now i got what you ment
[05:18:59] <fuchstronaut> this should work
[05:18:59] <mipo> fuchstronaut ,  I am using this : $('#new').last().show(300)
[05:19:28] <fuchstronaut> (mipo): if its not working, maybe jquery cant find any id "new" ?
[05:20:07] <mipo> "new" returnd from php file , when they send ajax
[05:20:21] <__machine> fuchstronaut: so its not recursive?
[05:20:36] <fuchstronaut> jquery cant find it, if its not in the DOM @ mipo
[05:21:12] <fuchstronaut> (__machine): well it is, but you can rename that old function
[05:21:49] <fuchstronaut> temp = old_xyz; old_xyz = new_xyz; new_xyz = function() { ...; temp(); }
[05:22:33] <__machine> fuchstronaut: isnt that what i did already?
[05:23:05] <fuchstronaut> old_xyz is pointing to a new function in your example
[05:23:19] <fuchstronaut> and you are calling it in itself
[05:24:13] <fuchstronaut> now im confused, does it work like this?
[05:24:29] <sadmicrowave> old_xyz isn't pointing to anything because new_xyz isn't defined yet when you define old_xyz
[05:25:13] <__machine> fuchstronaut: in my example… i assign xyz to old_xyz … then i make a new xyz function which executes some new code and then called old_xyz() … ?
[05:25:22] <Skyec> hi. The jqueryui... is it free for commercial use?
[05:25:26] <mipo> fuchstronaut ,Thank
[05:25:31] <sadmicrowave> Skyec, free
[05:25:47] <Skyec> sadmicrowave: thanks
[05:26:06] <fuchstronaut> (__machine): im not really sure with that
[05:28:05] <__machine> fuchstronaut: here is the actual code http://dpaste.com/569217/
[05:28:24] <__machine> i dont think its recursive... but doesnt seem to work
[05:29:19] <fuchstronaut> ye, i understood what you are trying to do. cant you simply try it out with firebug and console.log()`? consider what sadmicrowave wrote
[05:30:12] <sadmicrowave> technically new_xyz = function{}; old_xyz = new_xyz is the correct way to do this....
[05:30:40] <__machine> sadmicrowave: what's the difference?
[05:30:57] <sadmicrowave> the way you had it, new_xyz wasnt defined yet
[05:31:28] <sadmicrowave> so when you said old_xyz = new_xyz, if you alerted/console.logged old_xyz it would be 'undefined'
[05:32:33] <__machine> sadmicrowave: yet when? could you take a look at the actual code link? this code is run inside adium (webkit) so its not so easy to test
[05:33:02] <sadmicrowave> old_xyz = new_xyz;
[05:33:02] <sadmicrowave> new_xyz = function{
[05:33:02] <sadmicrowave>   //do something
[05:33:02] <sadmicrowave> };
[05:33:08] <sadmicrowave> will not work
[05:33:15] <sadmicrowave> yea hold on
[05:34:31] <__machine> sadmicrowave: thats not what i wrote... i wrote old_xyz = xyz; xyz = function() { ...; old_xyz(); } :)
[05:34:59] <sadmicrowave> "temp = old_xyz; old_xyz = new_xyz; new_xyz = function() { ...; temp(); }"
[05:35:10] <sadmicrowave> copied from the convo above
[05:35:58] <__machine> sadmicrowave: that was fuchstronaut's code, not my example
[05:36:18] <fuchstronaut> yep that was my idea
[05:36:33] <sadmicrowave> oh ok
[05:36:36] <fuchstronaut> im sorry for confusing and not helping
[05:37:36] <sadmicrowave> __machine, alright, let me go find your original link and see what the problem actually is, since I came in half-way through
[05:38:06] <__machine> http://dpaste.com/569217/
[05:39:23] <__machine> simplified version: http://dpaste.com/569220/
[05:40:30] <maciej> Hey so i am hiding options in a dropdown box.  the problem is that once i narrow the results down to where a new option is selected the select box does not reflect that value.
[05:40:30] <alex88> hi guys, i've a dynamic page in php, that can create multiple columns, i want that if the user check the checkbox in the <th> it checks all the others in the same column, how can i make that? remember that number of columns is dynamic
[05:41:14] <jeffsmykil> Is there a good way to debug ajax?  when i set a breakpoint in an ajax related call in firebug it simply doesnt display any of the data
[05:42:49] <maciej> alex88: just put a event listener on the check box then do $('#yourtable td[col_num]').attr('selected','selected')
[05:43:17] <maciej> alex88: you need to find first the index of the column which is easy
[05:44:18] <alex88> maciej: so i have to repeat the javascript code for each one?
[05:45:02] <sadmicrowave> __machine, could you tell me what it is doing/ or not doing?
[05:45:05] <KingDosser> I am trying to use the jquery autoresize textarea plugin http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/ but it isn't working and I think it might be because the textareas are in content loaded by AJAX. How might I fix this?
[05:45:14] <maciej> alex88: no something like $('#yourtableid th input').click(...
[05:45:38] <alex88> i was thinking, put the first checkbox inside td with an id, and all others in same column with the class same as the id, then do the trick for each checkbox inside the <th>
[05:46:03] <__machine> sadmicrowave: i'm just trying to provide a hook to execute additional code when an existing 3rd party function is called... with the simplified version, it should behave identical to the unaltered 3rd party code, but it completely fails...
[05:46:40] <__machine> sadmicrowave: in the webkit console, i get errors like "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded." and "TypeError: Result of expression 'coalescedHTML' [undefined] is not an object"
[05:47:08] <sadmicrowave> hmm, which hardly seem helpful
[05:48:49] <__machine> coalescedHTML calls alignChat, and i am renaming alignChat to old_alignChat and defining a new alignChat which calls old_alignChat() ... perhaps it's a closure issue? alignChat in the context of coalescedHTML is still the original function or something?
[05:49:04] <__machine> but even if it was, it should just still work as it did before instead of bombing...?
[05:49:47] <sadmicrowave> so why are you calling new-alignChat twice?
[05:51:12] <__machine> sadmicrowave: im not... i call old_alignChat() once in alignChat ... which should be called as often and by whatever code needs to call alignChat
[05:52:43] <sadmicrowave> __machine, is alignChat the 3rd party function?
[05:53:04] <lastk> hey guys, can you help me with this trouble? I have cloned a select, but when i change the value of the new select the value is changed on t he first select: http://jsfiddle.net/UcrD8/134/
[05:53:27] <__machine> sadmicrowave: yes, adium has a function called alignChat... that i need to add a hook into so i can execute some extra code, whenever the existing code calls alignChat
[05:54:08] <__machine> sadmicrowave: so i tried to rename alignChat to old_alignChat, and create a new alignChat that would execute my new code and then call old_alignChat()
[05:54:18] <sadmicrowave> lastk, cloning an element makes the new element EXACTLY the same as the old one, with the same class, ID, attributes and all...therefore if you reference $('#myselect') it's going to find both elements
[05:56:26] <lastk> sadmicrowave : yep, I even remove the id but the problem persist ;(
[05:56:33] <sadmicrowave> __machine, ok, I understand now
[05:58:32] <Paveloosha> @<lastk>, how did you removed 'ID'?
[05:59:00] <sadmicrowave> lastk, I agree, I'm not seeing that in your code
[05:59:59] <lastk> sadmicrowave : in this example the select even has no id
[06:00:19] <sadmicrowave> __machine, does this work http://dpaste.com/569231/
[06:00:44] <jeedey> I have a normal lightbox style overlay, but instead of positioning the content center, it is positioned below a button on the page, when the browser window resizes, it moves away from the button, any ideas?
[06:00:49] <sadmicrowave> lastk, well thats not helpful
[06:01:38] <__machine> sadmicrowave: that would only ever call alignChat once
[06:01:42] <Paveloosha> @lastk, you cant use same ID in same page..
[06:01:43] <lastk> I try somethings, like change the id, like $('select').last().attr('id','newid'); but I think the jquery mobile create some elements for the style etc..
[06:02:03] <jeffsmykil> i need to somehow set a boolean value at the beginning and end of this:  window.setTimeout(loadData, 5000);
[06:02:07] <Paveloosha> it will cause browser problem
[06:02:08] <jeffsmykil> is that possible?
[06:02:09] <sadmicrowave> have a meeting I'll be back
[06:03:10] <lastk> Paveloosha : sure, thats because I remove the id from my code, I just did this example to show you guys my problem, even i rename the thing to a class instead  a id, i have the problem
[06:03:34] <jeffsmykil> can I do something like this window.setTimeout(timeLineBoolean=false, loadData, 5000);
[06:09:35] <Paveloosha> @<lastk>, make a new fiddle with changed code..
[06:10:05] <_Li> I've got a series of divs that present a list of results based on a form. Some of these results will be active or inactive (and set the class accordingly). The inactive results need to be moved to the bottom in an animated way. Any hints on how to go about this?
[06:11:18] <jeffsmykil> maybe with jquery ui sort _Li
[06:15:14] <_Li> I've had a look at it but not sure how I would implement a solution with it.
[06:16:20] <jeffsmykil> _Li: that's probably something you should look into as it would take much to long to discuss right now
[06:18:59] <KingDosser> I am trying to use the jquery autoresize textarea plugin http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/ but it isn't working and I think it might be because the textareas are in content loaded by AJAX. How might I fix this?
[06:40:18] <KingDosser> I am trying to use the jquery autoresize textarea plugin http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/ but it isn't working and I think it might be because the textareas are in content loaded by AJAX. How might I fix this?
[06:41:54] <kborchers> KingDosser: are you calling autoResize on the text areas after they load? see ?demo
[06:41:54] <bot-t> KingDosser, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:45:02] <sadmicrowave> ok, lastk, __machine are your issues solved?
[06:45:53] <lastk> sadmicrowave : sorry, the mine nope :(
[06:46:23] <lastk> sadmicrowave : look, maybe my problem is because I clone a entire div and not only the select
[06:46:26] <sadmicrowave> ok, lets talk about it some more....are you wanting to insert the clone within the "select_option_groups" div?
[06:46:31] <lastk> make sense?
[06:46:36] <sadmicrowave> thats where I was going
[06:46:48] <lastk> sadmicrowave : I will put my real code no the pastie,ok?
[06:46:53] <sadmicrowave> ok
[06:46:56] <gamingdroid> I was hoping someone here can help me explain the idea of jsonp and cross domain communication. I understand you are dynamically inserting javascript code, attaching a callback function, but don't understand why JSONP service has to be implemented i.e. in a dynamic web language like PHP/java? Help would be much appreciated.
[06:47:32] <__machine> sadmicrowave: the only way i could get it to work was to alter the original function to trigger an event, and bind that event to a function elsewhere in my own code
[06:47:59] <lastk> sadmicrowave : http://pastie.org/2217870
[06:48:08] <sadmicrowave> __machine, well, at least its working
[06:48:23] <lastk> sadmicrowave : let me explain, i need always the comments get focus, clone that div .activities
[06:48:56] <__machine> i have a jquery object $('.x-container') ... i want to remove items from the beginning, until there are exactly N elements... how can i do this efficiently?
[06:49:29] <__machine> sadmicrowave: yes, but it's not ideal... it means i have to edit the adium application instead of just providing a message style that users can install...
[06:49:37] <sadmicrowave> __machine, a for loop with i <= x
[06:50:10] <sadmicrowave> then you say $(i + "-container" ).remove()
[06:50:37] <ajpiano> __machine, the elements you want to remove are children of that container, or are all .x-container?
[06:50:54] <lastk> sadmicrowave : I found this example on google, but it only clone the select: http://jsfiddle.net/UcrD8/45/
[06:51:14] <__machine> ajpiano all the elements are div.x-message, which are all children of #Chat
[06:51:46] <ajpiano> __machine, and how much is N
[06:52:06] <sadmicrowave> __machine, you could do $("[class*='-message'
[06:52:11] <sadmicrowave> shit sorry.. hold on
[06:52:19] <__machine> ajpiano: it could be 300 or up to 5000 for example (configurable)
[06:52:23] <ajpiano> ok
[06:52:49] <sadmicrowave> __machine, you could do $("[class*='-message']").each(function(i, e){ if( i <= N ){ $(this).remove() } });
[06:53:25] <Paveloosha> @Lastk, "counter++; var activityBox = $(this).parent().parent(); activityBox.attr('id','newId'+counter);" try this..
[06:53:43] <__machine> sadmicrowave x is a literal "x", not a number
[06:53:52] <ajpiano> __machine: i got this, give me a sec
[06:53:55] <sadmicrowave> oh
[06:53:59] <Paveloosha> dont forget to declare var counter = 0; at top;
[06:54:19] <sadmicrowave> __machine, well in any case, take out the variable in the selector and it still works
[06:54:59] <sadmicrowave>  $(".x-message").each(function(i, e){ if( i <= N ){ $(this).remove() } });
[06:55:15] <ajpiano> __machine var msgs = jQuery(".x-message"), l = msgs.length, n = 300, toRemove = l - n;  msgs.slice(0, toRemove).remove();
[06:55:42] <sadmicrowave> wow
[06:55:44] <__machine> sadmicrowave: wouldnt that just remove the first N items, instead of removing just enough items so that there are N items left?
[06:55:55] <KingDosser> kborchers: No, i'm not. How can I do that?
[06:56:15] <lastk> Paveloosha : same problem
[06:56:22] <sadmicrowave> __machine, sorry I didn't realize you wanted that, subtract N from $('x-message').size()
[06:56:56] <ajpiano> (which is what mine does :p)
[06:56:58] <Paveloosha> check your DOM structure.. may be there is the problem..
[06:57:28] <sadmicrowave> ++Paveloosha, I agree
[06:57:29] <Paveloosha> I need to log off now.. I will be online after 3 hours.. hope your problem may solv
[06:57:58] <lastk> Paveloosha : thank you
[06:58:38] <Paveloosha> just remeber not clash with same ID or class.. you can use same class but then you may need to bind them and use conditions..
[06:59:10] <Paveloosha> @<sadmicrowave>, I cant see any other option in his code..
[06:59:14] <Paveloosha> bye guys
[06:59:20] <sadmicrowave> later
[07:00:21] <kborchers> KingDosser: you're adding your textareas to the dom in the success callback of your ajax call, right?
[07:01:23] <__machine> ajpiano: that looks good... is there some kind of synchronicity issues? once you have msgs... by the time you get to slicing and removing, could there be more (or less) objects in msgs somehow?
[07:01:58] <ajpiano> no, jQuery collections are not live
[07:02:03] <ajpiano> the collection will stay the same
[07:02:07] <ajpiano> even if new elements are added
[07:02:12] <ajpiano> or removed
[07:02:18] <chuckles_> Was wondering if I could plaigarise some assistance? :) I'm essentially setting up a mouseover function that will fade images on multiple divs. What I'm trying to do it if I mouseout to another active mouseover area, it checks if the function is running and holds it in a non-faded state
[07:02:28] <ajpiano> which is definitely not going to happen during the amount of time it takes to initialize two other variables
[07:02:45] <chuckles_> I'm guessing this isn't possible because it looks asynchronous... just wondering if there were any workarounds / hacks
[07:03:05] <chuckles_> code here: http://lucastaylormusic.co.uk/stagingtest/fadetest2.html
[07:03:34] <chuckles_> I've added a delay to the mouseout to keep the function running... but...
[07:03:39] <ajpiano> chuckles_: you can check is(":animated") potentially
[07:03:56] <inferno> guys , facing problems with dropdown ,  my dropdown vanishes even before i can click it !!
[07:04:15] <ajpiano> chuckles_: what is the point of doing fadeTo with a 0 ms duration
[07:04:18] <ajpiano> why not just set the opacity
[07:05:10] <sadmicrowave> lastk, the problem is with the first bool option in the .clone() function
[07:05:26] <chuckles_> ajpiano: 600? 0 / 1 is the opacity state...
[07:06:35] <lastk> sadmicrowave : I tried that without too, but without the bool I cant even select the data
[07:06:37] <KingDosser> kborchers: I have alot of ajax calls and my ajax function is being dynamically loaded by lots of different calls. The ajax call is being returned as the value of the functionc all.
[07:06:39] <KingDosser> call*
[07:06:39] <ajpiano> uch, stupid fadeTo's method signature
[07:06:43] <sadmicrowave> lastk, I know
[07:06:59] <ajpiano> chuckles_: in any event, yeah, try checking is(":animated)
[07:07:10] <lastk> sadmicrowave : yep, I try load all datas after clone again..
[07:07:16] <chuckles_> ajpiano: thanks for the pointer, I shall go dig up some docs
[07:07:24] <kborchers> ?demo @ KingDosser
[07:07:25] <bot-t> KingDosser, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:07:31] <sadmicrowave> lastk, yea I'm trying something
[07:07:45] <inferno> guys , facing problems with dropdown ,  my dropdown vanishes even before i can click it !!   satyametal.com  <<< demo
[07:08:41] <KingDosser> kborchers: I can't replicate it.. its a whole site with many ajax calls and dynamically loaded content.
[07:08:47] <lastk> sadmicrowave : I will put that on a server ithink is better you look too, right?
[07:09:33] <sadmicrowave> lastk, nah I'm just using a jsfiddle and I'm having the same problem, so if I get this solved it will solve your problem too
[07:09:56] <lastk> good
[07:10:09] <inferno> kborchers : could you have a look in
[07:10:16] <lastk> sadmicrowave : thats because I'm having problem on the method from jquerymobile
[07:10:29] <lastk> uncaught exception: cannot call methods on selectmenu prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[07:11:18] <kborchers> KingDosser: hmmm, right after you load your textareas into the page, you should call autoResize like in the example here under usage http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
[07:11:38] <kborchers> inferno: where is the drop down supposed to be
[07:12:27] <inferno> you  saw the link  >> satyametal.com  ,,  consider about us
[07:12:31] <schnib> back again, same question as yesterday this time with an example :) working as intended or not the question is :D
[07:12:32] <schnib> http://jsfiddle.net/2ptQe/
[07:12:33] <kborchers> inferno: i see what your talking about, just a sec
[07:12:47] <inferno> kk
[07:18:46] <sadmicrowave> lastk, do you HAVE to use .clone()?
[07:19:34] <lastk> sadmicrowave : hehhe shit uh? well, I think the clone is the right way, what do you think?
[07:19:48] <sadmicrowave> I have another idea that you might like
[07:20:48] <kborchers> inferno: it's hard to explain what to do, but basically you can't use hover. you'll want to use mouseover and mouseout separately and you need to use a delay in your mouseout and make sure you aren't over your menu before closing it. make sense?
[07:20:56] <lastk> sadmicrowave : ok, tell me please
[07:21:03] <sadmicrowave> lastk, still working on it
[07:21:11] <lastk> ok
[07:21:14] <lastk> thank you
[07:21:35] <kborchers> inferno: this is not ready yet and not supported but you could use this as an example to help you http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Menu
[07:22:27] <tman> i'm trying to find out the longest element of a container
[07:22:32] <inferno> ok ,  i will  have a  look
[07:22:42] <inferno> thanks kborchers
[07:22:47] <tman> .. i just answered my own question..
[07:23:37] <ajpiano> tman: the height of the tallest element or a reference to the tallest element
[07:24:00] <KingDosser> kborchers, I tried calling hte function after loading the ajax but its still not working.
[07:24:48] <kborchers> KingDosser: i probably can't help you much more without seeing your code ... or at lease some of it. can you put the relevant pieces in a fiddle?
[07:29:35] <KingDosser> kborcheres : Sure, one sec.
[07:32:24] <sadmicrowave> lastk, geez this is pissing me off
[07:33:43] <KingDosser> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/UKghP/
[07:33:55] <__machine> can regular js code trigger custom events that jquery can detect? or must they be triggered by jquery?
[07:34:45] <lastk> sadmicrowave : hha, just tell me what you thinking..
[07:35:21] <bjhaid1> I am trying to implement a pop-up that responds to a get request that hits my server, I would appreciate if anyone can recommend documentations that I could read regards this
[07:35:24] <lastk> sadmicrowave : will be good if I can use server side :(, I was thinking in create a "template" no javascript, and do a innerHTML or something like that
[07:35:34] <sadmicrowave> lastk, I'm just trying to take the .html() value of #select_option_groups and make a new div with that id, and append all the content...pretty much the same thing as clone just doing it manually
[07:35:59] <anli__> If I have two elements that I want to put as content to a div, do I need to div.html(a); div.append(b);?
[07:36:08] <anli__> I tried to find a syntactically nicer way
[07:36:14] <anli__> like div.html(a,b); <-- did not work
[07:36:21] <lastk> sadmicrowave : maybe clone 1 by 1 instead the clone all the div
[07:37:12] <sadmicrowave> here: http://jsfiddle.net/UcrD8/139/
[07:38:02] <sadmicrowave> lastk, even with taking the html of the parent div and putting all that content inside a new div its not maintaining the options lists
[07:39:06] <lastk> sadmicrowave : do you wanna see how I populate the options?
[07:39:35] <kborchers> KingDosser: first i preach, you should really try to not use async false on ajax calls. it defeats the purpose of the "asynchronous" part of ajax and creates a bad user experience when the browser lock. ok done preaching. ;)
[07:39:45] <sadmicrowave> lastk, I don't think its relevant
[07:39:55] <lastk> hmm
[07:40:06] <sadmicrowave> at least not to our current problem
[07:40:16] <sadmicrowave> your* current problem
[07:40:18] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:40:29] <bjhaid1> I am trying to implement a pop-up that responds to a get request that hits my server, I would appreciate if anyone can recommend documentations that I could read regards this
[07:40:31] <lastk> lol
[07:40:52] <kborchers> KingDosser: not sure but i think you can call resize_input('#question_input'); after $('#question_input').val(''); ... i think
[07:40:56] <KingDosser> kborcchers: Could it be causing the browser to lag? Additionally, it wouldn't return the data if I didn't do the responseText. Unless there is some other way
[07:41:03] <anli__> bjhaid1: Maybe a jquery dialog is what you need
[07:41:22] <lastk> sadmicrowave : I have a meet with my boss now :( , if you still trying something there please send a link on pvt , anyaway thank you for your help
[07:41:26] <kborchers> KingDosser: yes, that is the browser "lag" you see because it has to wait on the ajax response
[07:41:34] <sadmicrowave> no problem
[07:41:41] <bjhaid1> anli_: how do I get that done, any documentations?
[07:41:54] <KingDosser> kborchers: How can I fix it then?
[07:42:04] <anli__> bjhaid1: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[07:42:34] <kborchers> without knowing your entire project, i probably wouldn't be wrapping everything in functions like that which would simplify things. then you put the code that makes your dom changes, etc in your success callback of the ajax call
[07:43:13] <kborchers> ?ajax @ KingDosser
[07:43:14] <bot-t> KingDosser, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:43:55] <kborchers> KingDosser: read that. it explains the items that you can access in the success callback so you don't have to return the responseText like you are now
[07:44:20] <KingDosser> kborchers: I need to return the data object to the cases, but that didn't work when I returned data in the success callback.
[07:46:01] <[unf]> could anyone help me as to why this don't work? http://jsfiddle.net/9zHhU/
[07:46:28] <kborchers> KingDosser: maybe move your case structure to a function that you call from success and pass data to that
[07:46:30] <[unf]> oops, here's a revision http://jsfiddle.net/9zHhU/1/
[07:48:37] <Kambfhase> [unf]: visible doesn't update, when you add the class
[07:49:03] <KingDosser> kborchers: can you think of any other method than that? Cause that will require an enormous redesign.
[07:49:44] <Kambfhase> [unf]: i guess what you really wanted is this: http://jsfiddle.net/9zHhU/2/
[07:50:21] <[unf]> holy crap yeah haha
[07:50:24] <[unf]> i'm so fail :|
[07:50:54] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:51:17] <kborchers> KingDosser: not really. when changing from non-async to async, it usually requires rewriting a lot of things since it is a totally different program flow. did you try my suggestion though about calling your resize function after setting the value to '' to fix that issue?
[07:51:45] <kborchers> KingDosser: it won't fix the lag but may get you going
[07:53:16] <KingDosser> kborchers: fail, I gave you the wrong case. :P
[07:54:16] <KingDosser> kborchers: Try reloading and check out the new case.
[07:54:18] <monk12> hey all, i had a quick question. if i wanted to set a property on each element to change/inspect later... would i do something like this: $('#my_table tr a').each(function(){ $(this).isClosed=true; });
[07:54:33] <monk12> i wasn't sure if i set it on the jquery $(this).isClosed or this.isClosed
[07:55:05] <Kambfhase> ?data @ monk12
[07:55:05] <bot-t> monk12, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:55:05] <[unf]> Kambfhase, but what if I have a list of links?
[07:55:11] <[unf]> I don't want them all to toggle...
[07:55:20] <[unf]> does the keyword 'this' come into play here?
[07:55:25] <kborchers> KingDosser: you need to send me the new link
[07:55:47] <KingDosser> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/UKghP/1/ Sorry, thats what happens at 3am :p
[07:56:31] <Kambfhase> [unf]: yeah, hm. i guess you could to $(this).next('p') which would be the <p> that immediately follows the <a>
[07:58:32] <kborchers> KingDosser: hmm, not sure then. is this happening before the page loads or after someone clicks something, or both?
[07:59:00] <monk12> cool thanks Kambfhase
[07:59:05] <KingDosser> kborchers: Both, but that ajax_done will be 0 if it is a page reload.
[07:59:06] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:59:23] <bEEEviz> guys
[07:59:26] <bEEEviz> problem:
[07:59:27] <bEEEviz> http://jsfiddle.net/kVg9n/
[07:59:39] <kborchers> KingDosser: ok, and #question_input is in the returned data or already in the page?
[07:59:56] <KingDosser> kborchers: It is returned in the list_questions ajax call.
[08:00:03] <bEEEviz> the ul which is inserted into the div has no wrapping paragraph
[08:00:11] <bEEEviz> (i know thats invalid html, but is that the reason?)
[08:00:15] <kborchers> KingDosser: ok, and where is that actually added to the page?
[08:00:34] <KingDosser> It is added into a <section> on my page kborchers.
[08:00:38] <lastk> sadmicrowave : ohh man, thats impossible lol
[08:00:41] <KingDosser> #content_slate to be exact kborchers.
[08:00:53] <kborchers> KingDosser: i mean, where is the js that does that?
[08:01:08] <sadmicrowave> lastk, what is?
[08:01:24] <lastk> sadmicrowave : thats clone
[08:01:41] <sadmicrowave> lol, no I'm very close, I just need to attach the event listener to the new element
[08:01:58] <lastk> cool
[08:03:58] <kborchers> KingDosser: i ask because you can't call your resize function until after that has been added to the dom, otherwise, there is no text area to initialize autoResize against. make sense?
[08:04:19] <bEEEviz> can anyone tell me why the wrapping div is removed after appending it to another div?
[08:04:20] <bEEEviz> http://jsfiddle.net/kVg9n/1/
[08:05:04] <gamingdroid> How can I ensure '$(document).ready(' works? I tried a very simple alert('Hello World'), but not functioning in multiple browsers....
[08:05:05] <KingDosser> kborchers: Yes it does. I am starting to realise how a big project can become very difficult to manage. Let me get those plugins for you, one sec. :)
[08:05:35] <KingDosser> kborchers: http://pastie.org/2218217 .
[08:07:29] <bEEEviz> gamingdroid any errors in console?
[08:07:37] <gamingdroid> sorry, I use IE
[08:08:27] <gamingdroid> bEEEviz: any quick way to check without having to learn firebug? I'm entirely new to jquery and javascript....
[08:08:32] <schnib> can someone tell me, if there is a downside, if in the jQuery Source on line 373 :
[08:08:32] <schnib> if ( deep && copy && ( jQuery.isPlainObject(copy) || (copyIsArray = jQuery.isArray(copy) ) ) )
[08:08:32] <schnib> would be changed to:
[08:08:33] <schnib> if ( deep && copy && ( jQuery.isPlainObject(copy) || (copyIsArray = jQuery.isArray(copy)) || jQuery.isFunction(copy) ) )
[08:08:33] <schnib> so that method-properties would be deepcopied ?
[08:08:39] <schnib> and im really sorry for annoying here with that :P
[08:09:45] <kborchers> KingDosser: just making sure, your text area is added to the page and you can edit it, right. it's just not autoResizing?
[08:10:02] <KingDosser> kborchers: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403441/jquery-ajax-pass-success-data-into-separate-function/2403549#2403549 Do you think that is what I might need?
[08:10:18] <KingDosser> kborchers: Yes, and If i paste the autoResize function into firebug, it works.
[08:12:08] <kborchers> KingDosser: that is basically what i was saying earlier where your success callback does the work rather than stopping the browser and waiting on the data but you would still have your case issue
[08:12:51] <KingDosser> kborchers: Why would it be a problem? Couldn't I just call the function with the callback from the case and it would return what I need?
[08:14:34] <kborchers> KingDosser: again without understanding all of your code it makes it hard but you were saying there would be an issue. what you are suggesting is what i said earlier, maybe just in a different way. ;)
[08:15:32] <jrockjiggz> can a dropdown css work on iphone?
[08:15:37] <KingDosser> kborchers: The issue was when I was trying to return data in the success, with async on but no callback.
[08:16:26] <kborchers> KingDosser: hmmm, but i suggested using the success callback. whether you use a named function or an anonymous function, it works the same
[08:17:06] <KingDosser> kborchers: If I were to change the calls in these cases and the ajax function to include a callback in the success, would this allow it to be asyncronous and fix my problem(s) ?
[08:17:20] <Aamir> Can this be more shorter >     jsRoot = jsRoot=='' ? 'js/' : jsRoot
[08:17:45] <shesek> jsRoot = jsRoot || 'js/'
[08:17:56] <Aamir> if its an empty string than? :P
[08:17:58] <kborchers> KingDosser: i'm still not sure if it will fix your autoResize issue but it will fix the browser hanging issue
[08:18:19] <KingDosser> kborchers: Okay, I'm going to give it a try. Can you bare with me please?
[08:18:56] <Aamir> ?js var jsroot=''; jsroot= jsroot || 'js/'; jsroot;
[08:18:57] <bot-t> Aamir: "js/"
[08:19:00] <Aamir> humm
[08:19:22] <Aamir> ?js var jsroot='  '; jsroot= jsroot || 'js/'; jsroot;
[08:19:23] <bot-t> Aamir: " "
[08:19:33] <kborchers> sure, i'll be around for a while. if i don't answer, just try again, eventually i'll see it. i am working so may be in and out
[08:19:37] <kborchers> KingDosser ^^^
[08:20:07] <KingDosser> Thanks kborchers, really appreciate it. :)
[08:22:15] <sadmicrowave> lastk, FML
[08:24:23] <jrockjiggz> ?eval [9,
[08:24:24] <bot-t> jrockjiggz: SyntaxError: syntax error
[08:25:10] <Absolute1> What could be wrong with this ajax call? http://pastie.org/2218293 When it get's to the server side the body and the put are both blank.
[08:25:26] <Absolute1> but the data sent isn't after verfication
[08:25:53] <jrockjiggz> missed something? http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110525.log.html
[08:26:16] <jrockjiggz> nm
[08:30:20] <KingDosser> kborchers: How's this? http://pastie.org/private/jtkjv0lt35isbbxgxvg
[08:34:56] <kborchers> KingDosser: not sure what you're doing there. what are you returning params to from the callback? and you should probably call that data to avoid confusion with your other params var
[08:35:29] <kborchers> KingDosser: and no need for ajax_done if using async
[08:36:14] <KingDosser> I need to set it once so that I know that the page has been loaded, because what is loaded changes depending on whether you have just refreshed the page or not.
[08:36:43] <kborchers> KingDosser: ok, but return params does nothing
[08:36:56] <KingDosser> kborchers: what should I do then?
[08:37:00] <KingDosser> do there *
[08:38:16] <Absolute0> ?
[08:38:29] <kborchers> KingDosser: i think that is where your case issue comes in because in the callback is where you handle the returned data so basically your entire case should probably be in your callback. i'll simplify your pastie to maybe clarify a little. just a sec
[08:38:30] <KingDosser> kborchers: What about this: http://pastie.org/private/jtkjv0lt35isbbxgxvg
[08:38:36] <Absolute0> http://pastie.org/2218293 <-body blank on server side
[08:38:43] <Absolute0> not blank went sent
[08:41:06] <kborchers> KingDosser: this is how it should work http://pastie.org/private/fe9m8euqaqmsvs9hhst8a
[08:41:19] <sadmicrowave> lastk, http://jsfiddle.net/cRwQC/2/ :)
[08:42:48] <KingDosser> kborchers: Okay, but I need to return the data in the success which I don't think works?
[08:43:21] <sadmicrowave> lastk, fyi, there is a jquerymobile channel
[08:43:48] <kborchers> KingDosser: that's my point. you don't "return" it. you handle it there, or you call another function (that has your case in it) and pass data that way
[08:43:55] <ryanneufeld> sadmicrowave: using an array and then join, is slower than just using + to concat
[08:44:05] <KingDosser> kborchers: Dam it lol.
[08:44:19] <KingDosser> kborchers: What if I did it the other way and have a callback in each case
[08:44:37] <kborchers> KingDosser ?
[08:44:51] <Iarfen> hi
[08:45:04] <Iarfen> what plugin of dates do you recommend me?
[08:45:11] <KingDosser> kborchers: Teh way I pasted earlier and have that callback in each case so it can process it each time?
[08:45:24] <sadmicrowave> ryanneufeld, very true, changed: http://jsfiddle.net/cRwQC/3/
[08:46:53] <kborchers> KingDosser: not sure you're understanding how that success callback works. whether you use my way (anonymous function) or your way (named function), it only executes when the ajax call is successful and every time you rerun that ajax call and it's successful. you can't run it from anywhere else. you wouldn't want to. make sense?
[08:47:19] <KingDosser> Omg kborchers lol.
[08:52:24] <whateverb> how can I override click over scroll   http://pastebin.com/q3BVEj20   those clicks are scrolls too, but I need click to do different function than if just scroll
[08:53:30] <Iarfen> someone here knows how to use Date Range Picker??
[08:54:15] <KingDosser> kborchers: http://pastie.org/private/yqfvqmkymcokixu7r7aya What about this?
[08:57:03] <Kzim> hey
[08:57:13] <kborchers> KingDosser: there are some errors i am cleaning up but that data = in the first function will not work. do you need data there since it's handled in the last function?
[08:57:41] <KingDosser> kborchers: Woops, missed that one. Is the general idea right though?
[08:58:21] <Kzim> hey i don't really understand how list mail in this JSON :/ {"uid=toto,ou=Users,dc=studio,dc=ca":{"mail":["billing@studio.ca","contact@studio.ca"]}} any can help me :(
[08:58:54] <sadmicrowave> .seen lastk
[08:58:54] <hsbot> lastk was seen 56 minutes and 55 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: cool
[08:58:55] <Protomega> SO I have a button that edits an entry. You press the button, a dialog box comes up, you hit submit, and all is good.
[08:59:03] <kborchers> KingDosser: i think so. this should be a little closer but i think you are on the right track now :D  http://pastie.org/private/fx5szc7qgs2jgmavs1weyw
[08:59:04] <Protomega> But then you can't edit that entry again until you refresh.
[08:59:47] <Protomega> Anyone know why this is?
[08:59:52] <Absolute0> quit
[08:59:55] <kborchers> KingDosser: then i think after your append in the last function is where you would call your autoResize
[09:00:06] <Protomega> Fudgepackets
[09:00:15] <Kambfhase> Kzim: please rephrase that question
[09:00:47] <KingDosser> kborchers: Would that work, in terms of the html being added after I try and use the autoresize
[09:00:48] <Protomega> Absolute0 that was to me right?
[09:01:01] <Protomega> Oh wait
[09:01:02] <Protomega> No
[09:01:04] <Protomega> He just left lol
[09:01:10] <kborchers> KingDosser: aren't you adding the html with append?
[09:01:26] <KingDosser> kborchers: Yes. :)
[09:01:41] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, how does the button edit the entry?
[09:01:54] <kborchers> KingDosser: so then it should be available to call autoResize
[09:02:18] <Kzim> Kambfhase: i have this JSON format and i would like to parle the mail that are in this JSON to display it. i tried but i can't manage to do it http://pastebin.com/rcmP3twf
[09:02:18] <Kzim> à
[09:02:31] <KingDosser> kborchers: Sweet, so now, I just need to integrate this new method into my code. Sigh haha. :)
[09:03:22] <Kambfhase> mkay
[09:04:38] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, it sends information to a page which does a MySQL query and returns if it was successful or not. If it was successful it changes the the text inside the selected elements.
[09:05:07] <Kambfhase> Kzim: well, before you can get the .mail you have to get the "uid=toto,..." first
[09:05:31] <Double_Rainbow> hello i need to do jquery post
[09:05:32] <sadmicrowave> right, but something you are doing during the change is taking away the element handler it sounds like...so can you paste your code? I don't need your server script
[09:05:36] <Kzim> i have it but i can't manage to get to the first object in it (that contain the mails)
[09:05:39] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, ^^
[09:05:49] <Double_Rainbow> what other tool can i use
[09:05:52] <Kzim> Kambfhase: i tried data[0].mail :(
[09:05:53] <Double_Rainbow> other than jquery?
[09:06:04] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, would it be easier if I just gave you a link to use?
[09:06:07] <kborchers> Kzim: can you reformat your JSON? with that distinguished name where it is, i don't think you'll be able to do it
[09:06:14] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, sure
[09:06:46] <Protomega> Mmk, and I apologize if I'm not making sense.. I'm extremely tired and this is my last problem before I take and head to bed lol
[09:06:56] <Kzim> i need to reformat the "uid=toto,ou=Users,dc=studio,dc=ca" in "toto"  and then i do data.toto.mail ?
[09:06:58] <sadmicrowave> ok
[09:07:30] <kborchers> Kzim: can you do something like {"dn":"uid=toto,ou=Users,dc=studio,dc=ca", "contact":{"mail":["billing@studio.ca","contact@studi o.ca"]}} then you could do data.contact.mail i believe

[09:08:48] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, link?
[09:09:09] <kborchers> Kzim: np, yeah otherwise you would have to do data.uid=toto,ou=Users,dc=studio,dc=ca.mail which obviously won't work
[09:09:11] <Protomega> Ugh it's not letting me do what I need it to okay do you just want the js?
[09:09:21] <sadmicrowave> yea pastbin it

[09:10:01] <Protomega> sadmicrowave, http://pastebin.com/Dau6hWMf
[09:10:28] <Protomega> I wonder if I have to delegate again after editing.
[09:11:26] <Protomega> I don't see why though.. I'm not editing anything but the text.
[09:13:30] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, so the first time the ajax returns success it works fine but not the second time?
[09:13:51] <Protomega> Uhh, the first time I try and edit it works.
[09:13:55] <Protomega> But the second time it doesn't.
[09:17:21] <Protomega> It seems like delegating doesn't do anything
[09:18:47] <sadmicrowave> for 1 your variable classification sucks lol - x,v,y,z these things arn't very easy to keep up with
[09:19:05] <Protomega> Yea sorry lol
[09:19:25] <Protomega> And my browser just crashed -.-"
[09:20:35] <Protomega> Maybe live?
[09:20:40] <sadmicrowave> this is really hard to figure out without being able to run the code and see where it breaks
[09:22:01] <sadmicrowave> live may be where the problem is, since you are appending tables, rows, and cells in your first submitCallback
[09:22:43] <Protomega> I mean, it works, like I can add the part and then edit it. But I can't edit a part and then edit something else lol
[09:23:02] <Protomega> Not really sure why I find that funny -.-
[09:23:43] <sadmicrowave> Protomega, did you try adding the delegate within the submitCallback that gets called from formUpdate
[09:23:44] <sadmicrowave> ?
[09:24:09] <Protomega> Yea, it doesn't work. :|
[09:24:12] <sadmicrowave> rephrased - did you try adding the delegate to the end of the second submitCallback function
[09:25:01] <sadmicrowave> I just don't think there is going to be a lot I can do from a pastebin in this case
[09:25:02] <Protomega> Yes
[09:25:46] <Protomega> Yea I know, it's alright though. :) Not that I'm refusing to put up the rest of the code, I'm just wore out and ready to go home so I think I might just go home lol.
[09:26:11] <sadmicrowave> alright, hollar on monday, maybe we can get something working
[09:26:23] <monk12> thought I'd ask this really quick... I'm reading 'Javascript the Good Parts' now. and was just curious why when they add a method to Function.prototype.method, that Number/String inherit this method. I would figure adding the method to Object, then Number/String objects will inherit that method... but Numger/String aren't functions, are they? Functions are their own objects in js?
[09:26:46] <monk12> so curious why Number/String inherit Functions methods
[09:27:29] <monk12> Page 33 if anyone has that book which i heard lotsa people do.
[09:27:44] <ajpiano> monk12, Number and String are constructors, which are functions, so....
[09:27:59] <ajpiano> that is why they'd inherit from Function.prototype, i'd assume
[09:28:04] <black_warlock> hello people !
[09:28:17] <monk12> ajpiano, ok excellent. gotcha.

[09:36:14] <KeyLimePi> ajpiano: Well, Im trying to integrate a jquery tooltip with Wordpress.  I have asked on Wordpress forums but have had no luck in getting the info.  They merely recommended I ask this channel instead
[09:37:26] <ajpiano> KeyLimePi: what does that have to do with an array and if else statements
[09:37:40] <ajpiano> are you even talking about a javascript array or a php one....

[09:38:35] <KeyLimePi> Well, the code Im working with is an array based on what is called from the back end selection
[09:38:58] <KeyLimePi> ajpiano: PHP array, I believe
[09:39:20] <ajpiano> KeyLimePi, are you relatively new to web development - pardon my asking?
[09:39:41] <sadmicrowave> ...
[09:40:07] <KeyLimePi> ajpiano: Ummm...I would say Im not as good at PHP in general but in this case, Im quite unsure how to make these 2 or 3 things work together, if at all.

[09:40:51] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, no php
[09:40:54] <sadmicrowave> not* php
[09:41:33] <KingDosser> kborchers: Do I need to worry about them in my script?
[09:41:48] <RobertV> when a user scrolls with the mousewheel, what event gets fired?
[09:41:54] <sadmicrowave> KingDosser, are you making ajax calls?
[09:41:56] <lastk> sadmicrowave : hey, thank you very much
[09:42:02] <lastk> I will try this
[09:42:11] <KeyLimePi> sadmicrowave: "not php"? I am not sure whaat you mean
[09:42:13] <kborchers> KingDosser: up to you. they're there if you need them but if data works for you then don't worry about them
[09:42:18] <sadmicrowave> no trying, it works, dont break it....by GOD don't break it !
[09:42:38] <ajpiano> RobertV, a mousewheel event :)
[09:42:57] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, I was trying to finish what ajpiano was saying. jquery is javascript - not php
[09:43:09] <kborchers> ajpiano: do u know if scroll also fires? just curious
[09:43:18] <Zol> I'm trying to make some kind of circular list of divs contained inside a div, like: http://jsfiddle.net/Klb5s/25/. What I want to happen is that when you click the left button for example, all divs should be moved to the left one step, and then the first div should replace the position where the last div was before the press. I'm having a terrible time getting this to work. appendTo() didn't help at all.
[09:43:50] <Zol> move to the right one step*
[09:43:51] <KeyLimePi> sadmicrowave:  I know this. I just mean Im trying to find out how jquery (in this case a tooltip) can work with a PHP array.  Im contemplating how to achieve something but it deals with both php (the array) and jquery.
[09:43:51] <ajpiano> RobertV, but it's ideal to normalize the event a bit using https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel/blob/master/jquery.mousewheel.js
[09:43:55] <ajpiano> kborchers it is
[09:44:20] <ajpiano> KeyLimePi, you should transform the php array to json and embed it somwhere in your page
[09:44:24] <ajpiano> so you can parse it on the client side
[09:44:33] <ajpiano> KeyLimePi, alternatively, you could store the tooltip data in the right place in the DOM
[09:44:41] <kborchers> ajpiano: i thought it would, though i wonder if it fires if you're at the top and mousewheel up and same for bottom. prob not
[09:44:46] <ajpiano> instead of just sticking it in a php array and hoping to magically deliver it to the frontend
[09:44:53] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, you would have to pass the array to javascript, most preferably as json_encoded then reference the elements of the array you want
[09:44:57] <ajpiano> kborchers, mousewheel only happens if it actually scrolls
[09:45:16] <kborchers> ah, i see. learned something :)
[09:45:43] <ajpiano> i  just found that out too :p
[09:45:59] <trumpetmic> hey, do you know any good examples (and maybe jQuery plugins) for search input boxes that show grey tips in the field that disappear when you start typing?
[09:46:07] <KeyLimePi> ajpiano: Oh dear.....I have no idea how to do this.  The only reason I am using a PHP array for now is because that is what the Wordpress plugin outputs. Im open to using a different form of the same thing but I am not familiar with how I would do it as you are suggesting it now (as in, I am not familiar with Json encoded javascript, nor DOM)
[09:47:00] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, well DOM elements are just your HTML elements, <body>, <div>, <table> blah blah blah
[09:47:51] <ajpiano> KeyLimePi: then i hope you understand that i can't really dig in and explain all that right now, there's a lot of tech in there for you to understsand and probably a couple hours of explaning :/
[09:47:53] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, you would either use json_encode() or embed the tooltips directly in the DOM, you wouldn't need both.
[09:48:05] <ajpiano> but if someone else is able to give you some guidance, then that is good :)
[09:49:07] <KeyLimePi> ajpiano: Okay. I am doubtful someone would want to bother with me, so I might be hosed for now in getting my information to be as convienient as I want it. Thanks for what you have given me though.
[09:49:09] <lastk> sadmicrowave : hmm I dont get very well, so I need to do the same thing to the others divs?
[09:49:09] <sadmicrowave> KeyLimePi, like ajpiano said, this is going to be a lot of explaining so I'll just point you in the right direction, the most helpful thing would probably be to read up on javascript and html before getting too far into this
[09:49:31] <sadmicrowave> lastk, same what thing?
[09:49:44] <lastk> <div id="select_option_groups">

[09:50:59] <trumpetmic> haha.  how do you make text input field labels that are inside the input field, fade when they receive focus, and disappear when typing begins?
[09:51:30] <lastk> sadmicrowave : because i have a div, with some inputs and this select, I need "clone" this set sometimes..

[10:06:26] <systemfault> velts: Why don't you check the documentation?
[10:06:36] <systemfault> They don't do the same thing at all.

[10:07:48] <phlp> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug
[10:07:49] <velts> i understand what each do...
[10:08:09] <velts> i would expect height() in IE and height() in FF to be the same but they are not
[10:08:19] <velts> same with innerheight and outerheight
[10:08:45] <whateverb> jQuery(".right").toggleClass(".right").toggleClass(".left")   , systemfault, does this change class from .right to .left?

[10:09:08] <systemfault> whateverb: It won't do what you want.
[10:09:09] <kborchers> whateverb: you can do toggleClass("right left") and it will toggle both
[10:09:20] <systemfault> kborchers's the pro :)
[10:09:22] <phlp> velts: its also quirks mode. does your page have a doctype?
[10:09:37] <velts> yes
[10:10:02] <whateverb> kborchers, but does it switch from right to left? meaning right class is removed and left is new class
[10:10:06] <kborchers> systemfault: don't know about that ;) i've seen you answer questions i don't know the answer to
[10:10:15] <kborchers> whateverb: yes
[10:10:48] <kborchers> whateverb: if it has right, it will be removed and if it doesn't have left it will add it
[10:12:10] <phlp> velts: luckily there is this simple chart for knowing which mode you are using in ie http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/images/MarcSil_IE8_Document_Mode_2.png
[10:18:42] <lastk> sadmicrowave : http://pastie.org/2218791 I need clone always all this stuff
[10:18:49] <bkad|home> is there any way to define different 'snapMode' rules for different selectors in a jqueryui draggable?
[10:20:24] <KingDosser> kborchers: I'm off for the night. Looks good though :)
[10:20:34] <KingDosser> kborchers: Cheers for your help.
[10:22:18] <kborchers> bkad|home: not that i know of. what are you trying to do?
[10:31:41] <crimlo> hey guys
[10:35:11] <EyePulp> anyone using yepnope?  I'm wondering if I can get the result of a test inside the complete:func()
[10:37:35] <bkad|home> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/bkad/gVrGH/3/
[10:37:56] <EyePulp> I can get it in the callback, but the callback isn't called if I'm doing a test and the test fails (I don't think)
[10:39:10] <bkad|home> kborchers: i'm creating draggable divs in a displaybox, i'd like the divs to snap to the inner displaybox and snap to the outer edges of the other created divs
[10:39:23] <bkad|home> but i don't think you can define separate snap rules
[10:41:20] <phlp> EyePulp: what would the point be of sending the result of the test to the callback if the callback is only run when the test is true?
[10:41:30] <whateverb> what is the best smooth page scrolling plugin
[10:42:50] <kborchers> bkad|home: nope, don't think there is any way to do that
[10:42:52] <EyePulp> phlp: the callback can be called in either group or singular situations, and in the group situation seems to be called under all circumstances, but in the singular seems to only be called on success
[10:43:09] <EyePulp> phlp: maybe it's a bug...
[10:43:33] <ravenzz> look guys http://jsfiddle.net/Su8FR/ i would to calculate the space between the end of the text and the beginning of the yellow span element.
[10:44:03] <ravenzz> i would fill the "whitespace" with something else (a dotted line)
[10:45:15] <kborchers> bkad|home: this works with a little extra snapping. it snaps to both inner and outer of both timeline and event http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/gVrGH/4/
[10:47:16] <kborchers> bkad|home: do you want them to be able to drag out of the timeline. if not you could do this instead http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/gVrGH/5/
[10:48:21] <bkad|home> kborchers: hmm interesting. I think i will take that approach, thanks!
[10:48:26] <kborchers> np
[10:54:42] <kW_> Hello, how can I select a particular element using an id, when this id is dynamically computed? E.g. something like: >>> var id = foo+"bar"; $("#"+id).dosomething() <<<, but without actually computing the jquery selector (because there would be need for escaping)
[10:55:20] <crimlo> I NEED A SENSEI!
[10:57:43] <whateverb> $("#idlink, .class2 img, .class3").live('click', function() {    this way only classes click works, how can I get #idlink click to work too?
[10:59:11] <phlp> whateverb: do you have other click events on the id? maybe one that returns false?
[10:59:55] <pash1k> does anybody here use zendesk?
[11:00:47] <whateverb> phlp,  ("#idlink").click(function () {
[11:00:55] <whateverb> but no return false there
[11:04:08] <whateverb> okay, found the problem
[11:04:53] <whateverb> but another question, is Google Maps API v3 and jQuery together slow?
[11:05:22] <schnib> is there a "pre-setup" jquery test suite ? something, where you can change the source of jquery and test if it breaks anything ?
[11:06:50] <Kambfhase> schnib: jQ has unit tests: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test
[11:07:17] <schnib> Thanks alot Kambfhase :)!

[11:08:01] <skylamer`> kambfh u german ?
[11:09:42] <brycebertola> can anyone recommend a good jquery plugin to rotate between divs, with a pause on hover?
[11:12:51] <mystMan> Hi I have a Modal that I created.  I want it only to run if a cookie is not set, and if it isnt set I want the script to run, then when they click a button in the modal i need it to set a cookie
[11:13:08] <Absolute0> is it bad practice if your js file is over a megabyte?
[11:14:15] <EyePulp> Absolute0: that's a lot of JS
[11:14:34] <Absolute0> most of the app is done on the front end so thats why
[11:14:42] <Absolute0> is that bad?
[11:14:56] <EyePulp> it's probably not a good sign, design-wise.   You may want to consider breaking that file up and loading some scripts on demand.
[11:15:25] <EyePulp> or possibly offload some logic to the server.  hard to say without details, but 1mb is a large chunk of js.
[11:15:39] <whateverb> is it faster to write directly .css( rather than .toggleclass(  ?
[11:18:12] <Absolute0> EyePulp: gmail seems to be around that size in js
[11:18:23] <Absolute0> they have like 3-4 300kb sized js files
[11:19:23] <EyePulp> Absolute0: are you trying to justify the size now?  I simply answered a vague question with a vague answer.  Now if you want to compare the complexity of gmail's client-side capabilities to whatever you built... I'm all ears. =)
[11:19:31] <phlp> that's like 0.2 SharePoints worth of js
[11:19:51] <coachz> What is the future of jQuery now that John Resig has moved on ?
[11:21:51] <Absolute0> EyePulp: I am not justifying, i know its wrong, just curious how gmail gets away with it.
[11:22:41] <skylamer`> Absolute0 do u ever heard of MINIFYING ?
[11:23:00] <Absolute0> its not my code anyways, was that way when i cam on board...
[11:23:02] <EyePulp> Absolute0: I imagine they cache well and probably do some on-demand loading.  Again, your original question can only be answered in the vague context in which it was asked.
[11:23:05] <Absolute0> coffeescript..
[11:25:50] <coachz> I assume with John Resig moving on there are other jQuery devs that will keep it rolling on solid.  yes ?
[11:26:27] <tmayr> resig is moving on? :o
[11:26:38] <coachz> he already did months ago
[11:27:06] <tmayr> i thought ht was still active on the "organizing" side of things, isnt he¿
[11:27:25] <coachz> http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/jquery_creator_john_resig_leaves_mozilla_joins_kha.php
[11:27:46] <skylamer`> lha ?
[11:28:19] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[11:28:39] <kborchers> coachz: in that article you see where it says he will continue to work on jQuery?
[11:29:24] <systemfault> jQuery would need a cleanup... too bad it's impossible without breaking every existing plugin :(
[11:29:24] <coachz> umm
[11:29:45] <coachz> sweet
[11:29:50] <coachz> great news :-)
[11:31:04] <tmayr> :p
[11:31:21] <Shwaiil> Q: Let's say I'm placing a setTimeout on a var called myTimeout = setTimeout( fn, 1000 ); to Call it I just have to place myTimeout on code right ? Tks for looking! I've asked this because on the folllowing code http://pastie.org/2219046 nothing happens when calling the settimeout var-
[11:31:39] <Shwaiil> Any help or sugestion is appreciated!
[11:32:23] <geekbuntu> does anyone have that link for the deferred execution for Shwaiil ?
[11:32:31] <geekbuntu> eric hynds blog?
[11:32:53] <joshteam> anyone work with Flot in here?
[11:33:01] <Shwaiil> geekbuntu, tks for looking. I can search for that "deferred execution" right ?
[11:33:23] <coachz> anyone using jquery mobile ?
[11:34:12] <coachz> to use jquery mobile do i have to rewrite my  non mobile site and have a new page for each mobile one ?
[11:34:22] <kborchers> coachz: u may also want to try #jquerymobile
[11:34:29] <GeoDud> @joshteam Flot is good stuff
[11:34:33] <coachz> thx
[11:35:07] <joshteam> GeoDud: yeah I love it, I just am stuck trying to figure out how to grab the X/Y position of a bar after it's been graphed.
[11:35:14] <Shwaiil> I found a solution. Declared the var first. the timeout inside the mouse events. solved!
[11:35:16] <joshteam> I'm trying to annotate a specific bar in the a graph
[11:36:12] <coachz> kborchers,  that channel appears dead
[11:36:23] <coachz> do you know the answer to my question ?
[11:36:48] <GeoDud> not sure, man...GL though
[11:36:49] <kborchers> coachz: no sorry, haven't dug too much into mobile yet. that's why i suggested the other channel ;)
[11:36:58] <coachz> thanks
[11:37:27] <redfox> hi. whats the best way to remove the last char of a string with jquery?
[11:37:48] <Kambfhase> the best way is to use native JS
[11:37:49] <phlp> coachz: ive used mobile but not sure what youre asking. you need pages just like a regular site
[11:38:13] <redfox> ok, ty.
[11:38:15] <coachz> phlp, so i have to write the site twice for it to work with normal browsers and mobile
[11:39:15] <geekbuntu> djQuery,/GeekbuntuSupport - thanks man :-D
[11:39:25] <djQuery> no prob
[11:39:38] <geekbuntu> i knew someone here had that url
[11:39:53] <phlp> coachz: well jquery mobile works in desktop browsers but if you mean render like a normal website then not necessarily
[11:40:17] <coachz> thanks
[11:40:52] <djQuery> coachz: browser sniffing server side to see which page to send them
[11:41:17] <coachz> i see
[11:41:47] <djQuery> course I believe there are a few comercial solutions that will transform ur current page to a mobile layout
[11:42:19] <coachz> ok thx
[11:43:23] <Paveloosha> @<coachz>, iot is better to develope a mobile virtion prototype.. all major sites do that too..
[11:43:44] <Paveloosha> eg. m.yahoo.com
[11:43:51] <coachz> so two sites
[11:44:18] <Paveloosha> yes, ofcourse..
[11:44:35] <coachz> we're gonna need a bigger boat
[11:44:49] <Paveloosha> there is is so many things which is not supported by mob.
[11:47:00] <Paveloosha> @ lastk, is your problem solved?
[11:48:04] <lastk> Paveloosha : I give up by now, the sadmicrowave give me a lot of help, but I cant apply for my problem , will try soon again
[11:48:34] <Paveloosha> did you tried that counter++ ?
[11:48:39] <lastk> Paveloosha : sure
[11:48:51] <Paveloosha> not worked?
[11:49:29] <lastk> Paveloosha : nope, we can work doing like the sadmicrowave show me, but how I need clone the entire div not only the select... is hard to do that
[11:49:52] <prkchp_sndwch> how can I append a node to an elem using add() that has text?
[11:50:13] <Paveloosha> can you send me that jsfiddle link again?
[11:50:31] <prkchp_sndwch> I have a table and I need to be able to append a row with a cell and a button that has a click() function executed when clicked on
[11:51:12] <Kambfhase> ?p @ prkchp_sndwch
[11:51:13] <bot-t> prkchp_sndwch, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:51:39] <Paveloosha> @<prkchp_sndwch>, you can use .clone()..
[11:54:13] <prkchp_sndwch> http://pastebin.com/ZDGPEbtA
[11:54:19] <prkchp_sndwch> I don't think clone is what I want
[11:54:38] <prkchp_sndwch> because the button's name needs to increment the number at the end of it
[11:55:02] <tuvwx> i'm using datatables jquery plugin and its ColVis feature, but the ColVis button, when used with jquery-ui, causes the header to be taller that it needs to be, and thus making it ugly. i remove the ColVis button and keep the filter/search text field and everything is fine
[11:55:05] <Xeon06_> Hey all
[11:55:29] <lastk> Paveloosha : I need to find which event is triggered when click on the select ( the event from that library )
[11:55:41] <Xeon06_> Is there some magic way of knowing when all templates (or a specific one) has finished loading using jquery-template?
[11:55:43] <tuvwx> i.e. i'm having a hard time reproducing this picture: http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/extras/ColVis/theme.html
[11:57:21] <phlp> prkchp_sndwch: you have id='minus' which you are appending the number to.. make it id='minus  (you have a single quote in the middle)
[11:58:05] <geekbuntu> prkchp_sndwch,name reminds me big trouble in little china... (pork chop express)
[11:58:23] <prkchp_sndwch> phlp, heh. that's embarrassing >_> thanks dude
[11:58:31] <phlp> np :)
[11:58:36] <Paveloosha> <prkchp_sndwch>, what is happening now?
[11:58:58] <prkchp_sndwch> Paveloosha, well there's some other problems with the code but overall I think I have what I need to fix it now
[11:59:06] <WebDragon> dangit jsfiddle is down

[12:02:53] <snover> prkchp_sndwch: jquery isn’t a framework
[12:04:14] * WebDragon kicks jsfiddle.net .. . o { wake up, you! }
[12:04:38] <djQuery> WebDragon: have you looked at jsbin.com
[12:04:51] <djQuery> has some nice features. like the autocomplete
[12:06:51] <Kambfhase> jsfiddle > all
[12:07:10] <djQuery> WebDragon: http://tumblr.com/xuy33osk79
[12:08:01] <WebDragon> djQuery: cool. that'll work
[12:08:12] <WebDragon> ok so the js works on jsbin, but not on my dang page. wtf
[12:08:31] <djQuery> link?
[12:09:40] <WebDragon> wait I think I see why
[12:09:53] <WebDragon> doing too many things at once within the each and it's confusing the regex from continuing
[12:11:25] <WebDragon> yeap got it. needed two each() blocks in succession
[12:13:37] <WebDragon> woot jsfiddle is back
[12:17:01] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/37WZf/
[12:17:20] <WebDragon> needed two each'es. or the 2nd price under mediterranean tuna wouldn't get the sup
[12:17:57] <Kambfhase> mmm, tuna!
[12:18:45] <WebDragon> finally got the opportunity (read: he's ready to spend the money at long last) to redo a local restaurant's website and get it to stop looking like a glorified craigslist ad and more like a classy place to eat
[12:19:28] <Kambfhase> btw, you can circumvent the first .each by using.html(function(){ foo})
[12:19:37] <WebDragon> all the pretty pictures in the world can't overcome last year's (i.e. tables-based-era) html techniques
[12:20:11] <Kambfhase> I like tables. much more intuitive than css.
[12:20:51] * WebDragon finds css pretty intuitive. it's the disparity between the various browser companie's implementations that fubar things up
[12:21:00] <WebDragon> you're lucky they all agreed on how tables should work :P
[12:21:22] <WebDragon> s/companie's/companies/
[12:21:55] <skylamer`> WebDragon
[12:22:01] <skylamer`> what do u mean by 'two each es' ?
[12:23:23] <Kambfhase> css intuitive? It's in english. that makes it unintuitive for most people in the world
[12:24:04] <skylamer`> the swiss cheeze ?
[12:24:47] <WebDragon> skylamer`: each()'s
[12:24:54] <prkchp_sndwch> ok, I reformulated my question into something much simpler. basically I'm trying to work out this selector described in the paste. my problem is here: http://pastebin.com/6GGqZwaE
[12:25:21] <Kambfhase> width vs. height. i mean, srsly how can you make the spelling of two words do hard? totally ignoring the fact that tthey are unpronouncable
[12:25:34] <prkchp_sndwch> also, speed is not a problem here so this selector can be ugly and slow if needed :)
[12:26:21] <gamingdroid> anyone familiar with yql?
[12:26:22] <WebDragon> Kambfhase: so like this? http://jsfiddle.net/37WZf/10/
[12:26:24] <Kambfhase> prkchp_sndwch: do you want to remove the button or the row?
[12:26:34] <prkchp_sndwch> oh, the whole row
[12:27:22] <ocf> 'llo all. have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ocf_/krw2v/ ... dynamically building a table that I want to place inside a div in a jquery Dialog. The table builds fine, but it just inserts itself into the div on my page, and no dialog window pops up
[12:27:45] <Kambfhase> prkchp_sndwch: $('#minus1').closest('tr').remove()
[12:27:46] <ocf> wondering if I can have a <div id="NewNotificationsTable"> inside of my dialog div, or if thats a no-no?

[12:30:15] <prkchp_sndwch> Kambfhase, hmm it works the first time by removing the last row instead of the row the button resides on. after that it doesn't do anything

[12:45:47] <sadmicrowave> alright guys, I need help for a change. I'm looking for a way to make a list of <li>'s traversable via up and down arrow keys.  So initially :first-child should have focus, then as I arrow down, .next() should get focus and so on.  I've written my own function to do this but it is buggy, and before I spend much longer debugging I'm wondering if there is a pre-existing function for this....
[12:46:17] <imsky> that sounds...pretty easy
[12:46:26] <sadmicrowave> indeed it does
[12:47:04] <imsky> so you've already searched the googles for this?
[12:47:14] <winux> hi all, i have a link, <a class="pop-link" href="'.$base_url.'/post.php?fid='.arg(1).'" onclick="return false;"> which pops up a div window containing a forum.. is there a way i can javascript to the overlay through the onclick call? (specifically im trying to add a wysiwyg editor to the overlay which contains a textarea)
[12:47:37] <sadmicrowave> imsky, it starts getting more complicated when I add .scrollTo( el ) where el is my element with focus, and I can't scrollTo on elements that don't exist, so I must stop the .next() and .prev() iterations when index() is 0 or N (size of <li>'s)
[12:47:38] <winux> not a forum, but a form
[12:47:49] <Fox___> is it possible to both catch a paste value and block it being actually pasted?
[12:48:15] <imsky> sadmicrowave: why do you have elements that don't exist?
[12:48:16] <carbocation> winux: What about creating a live listener that is bound to the form element by class or by ID?
[12:48:38] <carbocation> winux: what javascript are you trying to execute on the form?
[12:49:11] <carbocation> winux: basically are you just trying to intercept form submission and use ajax to submit instead of changing the window.location?
[12:49:17] <sadmicrowave> imsky, lol, that sounds funny but its true, if I do a .next() after the last-child and then attempt to scrollTo() that element, scrollTo breaks
[12:49:49] <imsky> sadmicrowave: sounds like you need to get your head wrapped around scrollTo, then
[12:49:49] <sadmicrowave> imsky, similarly, if I do a .prev() after the first-child and scrollTo that element it breaks
[12:49:51] <winux> carbocation: i actually want to insert a <script> tag which points to a WYSIWYG editor into the popup
[12:50:06] <winux> carbocation: inside the popup code
[12:50:20] <sadmicrowave> imsky, I understand scrollTo, nothing more to wrap my head around, my question is if there is a function that doesn't require me to use scrollTo
[12:50:39] <sadmicrowave> or an element type...or a plugin
[12:51:05] <imsky> sadmicrowave: not that i know of, though there are likely tons of just these solutions baked into other plugins
[12:51:13] <prkchp_sndwch> another problem. the first row's column shifts over an extra columns width when a row is added. I'm trying to get the offset of the first row's 2nd column but this is returning null
[12:51:14] <prkchp_sndwch> var offset = $("#articles").eq(0).children("tr").eq(0).children("td").eq(1).offset();
[12:51:17] <imsky> i wrote my own highlighter with keypresses a while ago
[12:51:31] <winux> carbocation: or just make a totally new div popup of my own design.. i tried directly inserting javascript code into the page but something is stripping the script tags
[12:51:56] <djQuery> winux: see ?ui.dialog
[12:51:56] <bot-t> winux, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[12:52:24] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: you don't need those eq(0)'s since # articles should only return a single element. id's are unique
[12:52:39] <carbocation> winux: Is it 100% necessary to include the script with the form? The script should probably be included in the page calling the form...
[12:53:12] <winux> carbocation: i tried 10 different ways, but something is stripping the <script> tags (it's within a CMS)
[12:53:12] <prkchp_sndwch> kborchers, with var offset = $("#articles").children("tr").children("td").eq(1).offset(); I'm still getting a null offset
[12:53:25] <winux> carbocation: it's driving me nuts too
[12:53:36] <erichynds> prkchp_sndwch: does that selector match anything?
[12:53:55] <winux> carbocation: looking at the source the src = and all other parameters are there, even the ending </script> tags, but the first one is removed
[12:54:15] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: try $("#articles tr td:nth-child(2)").offset();
[12:54:17] <prkchp_sndwch> erichynds, I know $("#articles" matches the correct table. I'm not for sure how to test the rest of them to see if they work
[12:54:33] <erichynds> prkchp_sndwch: console.log the entire statement, prior to offset()
[12:54:59] <prkchp_sndwch> kborchers, that one worked
[12:55:05] <prkchp_sndwch> thanks a lot, again
[12:55:10] <kborchers> yep
[12:57:18] <Fox___> is it possible to both catch a paste value and block it being actually pasted?
[12:58:05] <djQuery> Fox___: .bind('change', fucntion(){})
[12:59:08] <djQuery> store the value on key up in an attribute. then on change compare to see if the length of the value is greater than the length of the attribure + 1
[12:59:27] <Fox___> key up?
[12:59:29] <djQuery> but that wont realy prevent paste
[12:59:41] <djQuery> .keyup
[12:59:46] <djQuery> ?.keyup
[12:59:46] <bot-t> .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[13:01:00] <Fox___> as far as i know keyup only works with keys
[13:01:36] <prkchp_sndwch> kborchers, if you don't mind me asking how could I use your selector to select the first row's 2nd child's input box?
[13:03:14] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: if i understand you correctly, $("#articles tr:first td:nth-child(2) input")
[13:03:25] <prkchp_sndwch> yeah, that's what I tried too
[13:03:27] <prkchp_sndwch> didn't work
[13:03:40] <kborchers> ?demo @ prkchp_sndwch
[13:03:40] <bot-t> prkchp_sndwch, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:03:43] <prkchp_sndwch> remember it's technically the input box that slides way over to the right for no reason so I need to correct it
[13:16:11] <bobbobbins> hey, im using $("div").each to loop through all the divs on my page, but in there im writing divs, and i guess its causing an infinite loop...is there a way to loop through only the existing ones on the page, and not any new ones created?
[13:17:41] <ajpiano> bobbobbins, that shouldn't happen.  the collection won't receive the new divs you've created and iterate those during the loop
[13:17:43] <kborchers> bobbobbins: there must be a different issue because adding divs inside of each will not cause your selection to change. once selected, that is a finite set of divs. see ?demo
[13:17:44] <bot-t> bobbobbins, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:17:58] <ajpiano> lol kborchers
[13:18:07] <kborchers> ajpiano: again with the pulling thoughts from my brain ;)
[13:18:13] <ajpiano> teehee
[13:18:38] <bobbobbins> ajpiano, ok, hang on...im gonna jsfiddle this thing
[13:23:43] <bobbobbins> ok, heres a copy of it: http://207.228.238.25/spdi/Special_Ed_Starting_dev_server_David.html
[13:31:11] <Zerone> anybody knows how i can manipulate the <head> section with jquery (i want to load a css file dynamically)?
[13:34:47] <bobbobbins> is anyone taking a look?
[13:35:29] <prkchp_sndwch> ok, so kborchers got the add a row thing fixed (thanks a lot!) but for some reason the 2nd column in the first row keeps shifting over to the right when I add a row. here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/WHH9M/
[13:35:40] <phlp> yes looks like the whole spdi() is in a loop
[13:35:57] <misterm> Zerone: it's basically like any other dom manipulation...get head element, append to it
[13:37:34] <Ogredude> if I'm using .append and .remove, what's the appropriate way to tie a .fadeIn and a .fadeOut effect to those, respectively?
[13:38:08] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: you mean like fadeout and then remove?
[13:38:28] <Ogredude> yeah, I want to add something and fade it in, and for the other side, fade it out and remove it
[13:39:04] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: first run .hide on the element before you append it
[13:39:16] <Cork[home]> and to .remove in the callback for fadeout
[13:39:33] <Ogredude> hmmm okay, the removing makes sense
[13:39:45] <Ogredude> but I'm adding li's to a ul, and I don't want to fade out the whole ul
[13:39:53] <Ogredude> can I append something as hidden and then fade it in?
[13:40:19] <bobbobbins> phlp, yeah, it seems that way...any idea why that would happen?
[13:40:30] <Cork[home]> var li = $('<li/>').hide(); parent.append(li); li.fadein()
[13:40:40] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: ^
[13:41:11] <Zerone> misterm: $("head").append( link );    somethingh like that i think
[13:41:16] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: what browser?
[13:41:24] <prkchp_sndwch> firefox 3.6
[13:41:26] <Ogredude> cork: OK, that makes sense
[13:41:48] <misterm> Zerone: more or less, yes
[13:41:49] <prkchp_sndwch> yeah, for some reason it's not really showing on jsfiddle. should I just paste the whole file or is that bad form?
[13:42:16] <Ogredude> no, that doesn't make sense.
[13:42:44] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: what doesn't?
[13:42:48] <Ogredude> so I'd do var li = $('<li>My stuff</li>').hide();
[13:42:52] <Ogredude> right?
[13:42:55] <Cork[home]> ya
[13:42:58] <Zerone> msterm: ok thx
[13:43:08] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: there is something else wrong because the fiddle works fine. i guess paste the whole thing, not sure if it will help
[13:43:08] <Ogredude> ok, I thought $() was a selector only
[13:43:17] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: or $('<li/>').html('
[13:43:21] <Cork[home]> *My stuff');
[13:43:40] <Cork[home]> (hate when i hit enter instead of ' >_<)
[13:44:24] <Ogredude> heh
[13:44:55] <Ogredude> ok I need to go look at exactly what $() does then, because I thought it was only there to return elements from the DOM that match the CSS selector.  Didn't know you could use it to pre-build elements
[13:45:21] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: if you add <> around an element type jquery will do createElement
[13:45:35] <Cork[home]> if you don't it will so the dom selection
[13:45:47] <Cork[home]> if you give it a function it will do .ready
[13:45:51] <prkchp_sndwch> here's the html page: http://pastebin.com/VWJi8ft7
[13:45:52] <Cork[home]> (on the document)
[13:45:54] <Ogredude> ah okay
[13:45:58] <Cork[home]> thats about it
[13:46:04] <Ogredude> and $() is simply a shortcut for jQuery() correct?
[13:46:07] <Cork[home]> ya
[13:46:14] <atxq> so css.("color") return an rgb value. how can I return the hex value instead?
[13:46:15] <Cork[home]> jQuery actually
[13:46:15] <misterm> Ogredude: that's one of the major beefs some people have with jQuery
[13:46:20] <prkchp_sndwch> should make the first row's second column move over to the right for no reason
[13:46:44] <phlp> bobbobbins: try removing the return in the second each and calling $this[function_name] instead
[13:46:45] <Cork[home]> misterm: you mean that is uses $ ?
[13:46:52] <prkchp_sndwch> on ff 3.6.18 specifically
[13:47:04] <misterm> Cork[home]: I mean the overloading of $
[13:47:05] <Cork[home]> misterm: or that it overloads the $ function
[13:47:09] <Cork[home]> ah
[13:47:23] <Cork[home]> misterm: i think its grate, its farly easy to remeber and all
[13:47:27] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: if you added the whole file and updated, you need to send me the new link
[13:47:35] <Ogredude> ok that's where I was confused
[13:47:42] <Ogredude> jQuery() does a *whole lot of different things*
[13:47:43] <systemfault> Cork[home]: The problem? It's not the only library using that character.
[13:47:57] <Cork[home]> systemfault: i know
[13:48:04] <bobbobbins> phlp, nope, that didn't work
[13:48:07] <prkchp_sndwch> kborchers, http://pastebin.com/VWJi8ft7 is the entire html file with all of the code in it
[13:48:09] <Cork[home]> systemfault: but i meant the overloading of the main function
[13:48:10] <bobbobbins> i just don't get it
[13:48:11] <misterm> I don't think it's too, depending on what you're working on
[13:48:16] <Ogredude> misterm:  which is one of the major beefs?
[13:48:17] <misterm> *too bad
[13:48:26] <atxq> I am trying to toggle table cell background-color, but I want to return the hex value of the cell background-color so i can check it before assigning the appropriate color
[13:48:31] <misterm> Ogredude: hm?
[13:48:42] <Cork[home]> Ogredude: i asked a few lines up and got the answer
[13:48:43] <atxq> is it possible to return the hex value instead of the rgb?
[13:48:48] <Cork[home]> just scroll up ;)
[13:48:48] <systemfault> Cork[home]: That's a jQueryism, it's bad design but it's easier to use.
[13:49:13] <Cork[home]> systemfault: its bad for performans normally too ya
[13:49:28] <systemfault> Let's be honest, jQuery is a "god object"
[13:49:39] <Cork[home]> heh
[13:49:48] <misterm> It's less explicit as well, which can lead to maintainence problems in some situations
[13:49:54] <Cork[home]> method jit can't handle dynamic functions well, it gets really slow
[13:50:11] <kborchers> prkchp_sndwch: first try fixing <td><input type='text' name='articletitles[]' /><td> that last <td> should be </td>
[13:50:21] <Engin> how to introduce global variable in a if scope ?
[13:50:50] <Cork[home]> Engin: if your not using ecmascript 1.8 if doesn't have scopes
[13:50:56] <Engin> I'M sure there's already a code snippet for this though... if(console == undefined) window.console = {log: function(m){}}; ?
[13:51:07] <prkchp_sndwch> kborchers, ....................damn it
[13:51:10] <prkchp_sndwch> thanks. that worked :D
[13:51:11] <Engin> hmm
[13:51:15] <misterm> Js has scopes, it just doesn't have block scope
[13:51:17] <prkchp_sndwch> I cannot into HTML
[13:51:27] <systemfault> Cork[home]: No ecmascript has block scoping, don't mix ecmascript and mozilla's javascript.
[13:51:35] <phlp> bobbobbins: in spdi.IEPRow.js $(this) should be $this
[13:51:36] <Cork[home]> systemfault: let
[13:51:42] <Cork[home]> let is function scoping
[13:51:43] <systemfault> Cork[home]: Mozilla's javascript is a playground...
[13:51:48] <Cork[home]> *sorry if scroping
[13:51:51] <systemfault> Cork[home]: It's still not standard.
[13:51:59] <Engin> so if(console == undefined)var console = {log: function(m){}}; should work ?
[13:52:06] <Cork[home]> Engin: it is in 1.8
[13:52:11] <Cork[home]> thats why i stated that version
[13:52:23] <Engin> well, in IE8 I couldn't get it to work
[13:52:27] <bobbobbins> phlp...ohh...so using $(this) was calling $.spdi all over again?
[13:52:30] <misterm> Engin: Engin if that's done in the global scope
[13:52:33] <Cork[home]> Engin: ie uses 1.5
[13:52:54] <Engin> it is in the global scope and apparently not working
[13:53:08] <Cork[home]> Engin: just check the value agenst window.console, and set window.console and you will do everything in the global scope
[13:53:38] <Engin> that's why I suggested in the first place, it didn't work either let me see :)
[13:53:41] <systemfault> Cork[home]: Thanks to Mozilla, there's now a terminology problem.
[13:53:58] <Cork[home]> systemfault: what do you mean?
[13:54:09] <Cork[home]> btw mozilla isn't the only ones driving ecmascript
[13:54:22] <elrise> hi guys
[13:54:22] <phlp> bobbobbins: yeah somehow.. it ended up with a jquery object being sent to options and extending settings. whole thing was kinda odd
[13:54:49] <bobbobbins> phlp: weird, well thanks for catching that, I would have never figured it out
[13:54:49] <Cork[home]> systemfault: mozilla drives javascript (there implementation) but not ecmascript
[13:54:57] <Cork[home]> just like html and css
[13:55:03] <systemfault> Cork[home]: You couldn't be more wrong.
[13:55:04] <phlp> bobbobbins: np :)
[13:55:04] <elrise> How can I print the value of variable outside of my script tags?
[13:55:19] <elrise> lets say inside a <p class="something"></p>
[13:55:40] <systemfault> Cork[home]: We say we use "Javascript" but in fact, we're using dialects of ecmascript. Mozilla's implementation of Ecmascript is called Javascript... so people are tempted to use Mozilla extensions... but they're not standard, they're not part of Ecmascript.
[13:55:43] <kborchers> elrise: $(".something").html(your_var);
[13:55:54] <Cork[home]> elrise: $('.something').html(my_var);
[13:55:57] <Cork[home]> opps
[13:56:01] <elrise> just like that?
[13:56:10] <Cork[home]> ya
[13:56:10] <elrise> awesome :)
[13:56:19] <misterm> elrise: there's a lot of different ways you might do it, but .text() or  .html()  are pretty straightforward
[13:56:29] <systemfault> Cork[home]: Mozilla doesn't decide anything at all, it's a committee. The proof? Do you know where is ECMAscript 4 now?
[13:56:43] <Kambfhase> in hell!
[13:57:12] <Cork[home]> systemfault: uh... what part of what your just stating contradicts what i said before?
[13:57:25] <Cork[home]> thats exactly what i said... >_<'
[13:57:39] <Kambfhase> this whole JS/ES discussion is leading us nowhere
[13:58:45] <Cork[home]> systemfault: don't miss understand me, i completly hate where they heading with future additions
[13:59:06] <Cork[home]> let isn't one of them though, its a good idea
[14:00:38] <elrise> Will something like this work $('.something').html(results[0].formatted_address); ?
[14:01:00] <Cork[home]> if that array and object combination exists, sure
[14:01:01] <misterm> elrise: in theory, yes
[14:01:43] <elrise> cool, going to test right now!
[14:01:43] <elrise> thanks for the help
[14:05:30] <skypce> hi friends, how can i override a <li> text with jquery?
[14:06:13] <Cork[home]> skypce: overide?
[14:06:17] <Cork[home]> you mean replace?

[14:34:44] <webBuilder> versatiletech, but when I print with alert my xml it arrives to the brower, the only time it breaks is where there is this comment on my code //print each tutorial title followed by their categories
[14:35:09] <webBuilder> versatiletech, exactely where it said jQuery(xml).find('ROWFROMVIDEODATA').each( function(i) { ...
[14:35:35] <webBuilder> versatiletech, there is not looping well why is that
[14:37:06] <black_warlock> nobody knows ?
[14:37:41] <black_warlock> =(
[14:38:14] <misterm> black_warlock: can you clarify your question?
[14:38:31] <black_warlock> im just loading a div inside another div
[14:38:51] <black_warlock> but this operation doesnt write the html in my page
[14:39:03] <black_warlock> it just load the div
[14:39:13] <misterm> black_warlock: what do you mean by "loading" and what do you mean "write the hyml in my page"?
[14:39:27] <black_warlock> i wish to know if there is a way to write all the html conteined in tha original div
[14:39:43] <misterm> black_warlock: write it to what?
[14:39:45] <black_warlock> $('#main').load('upload/upl.asp #conteiner').fadeIn("slow");
[14:39:49] <black_warlock> see
[14:39:57] <misterm> black_warlock: you can get the html of a div with .html()
[14:40:08] <black_warlock> i call the conteiner inside my page div named main
[14:40:32] <black_warlock> infact
[14:40:40] <black_warlock> i have tried
[14:40:47] <versatiletech> webBuilder: could your XML be malformed?
[14:40:49] <black_warlock> $('#main').load('upload/upl.asp #conteiner').html.fadeIn("slow");
[14:40:54] <black_warlock> like this
[14:40:55] <misterm> black_warlock: your question still isn't clear
[14:41:04] <misterm> black_warlock: is that not working for you or something?
[14:41:17] <black_warlock> it works but
[14:41:18] <webBuilder> versatiletech, no because on Ubuntu works
[14:41:30] <webBuilder> only on windows platform is not working at all
[14:41:33] <versatiletech> I'd have to look at your xml
[14:41:42] <versatiletech> try using $.ajax
[14:41:43] <webBuilder> I can paste one for  you
[14:41:45] <black_warlock> i got some code inside that div that isnt been executed
[14:42:02] <misterm> black_warlock: .html() is a function not a property
[14:42:06] <versatiletech> and make all your xml tags lowercase
[14:42:15] <webBuilder> versatiletech, i'm pretty new with jQuery in fact i'm trying to see $.ajax
[14:42:24] <versatiletech> actually try $.ajax first
[14:42:36] <webBuilder> do you ahve any $.ajax example
[14:42:38] <black_warlock> to be more clear : there are pictures inside the orginal div
[14:42:40] <webBuilder> I"m trying to find on web
[14:42:43] <versatiletech> it's pretty simple
[14:42:54] <versatiletech> yeah let me write one up real quick
[14:43:02] <black_warlock> but the shadow box on click doesnt work
[14:43:05] <misterm> black_warlock: I still have no idea what you're asking, sorry
[14:43:18] <webBuilder> any var is okay=$.ajax("what do I put in here")
[14:43:28] <webBuilder> thank you so much versatiletech
[14:43:43] <misterm> black_warlock: I'd create a jsfiddle, or pastebin your code and explain exactly what you expect it to do and exactly what's not working
[14:44:34] <highend> gn8 and thanks again phlp!
[14:44:47] <versatiletech> anyone know of a site that generates test data, preferably xml to test AJAX. I know I ran across a site like that a very long time ago.
[14:46:07] <webBuilder> versatiletech, look this http://think2loud.com/224-reading-xml-with-jquery/
[14:46:15] <webBuilder> do you think this is a perfect example
[14:46:17] <webBuilder> ?
[14:46:35] <webBuilder> versatiletech, where it said sites.xml can I put my url?
[14:46:45] <versatiletech> yeah that's a good example
[14:46:58] <webBuilder> versatiletech, okay let me change my code Thank you again
[14:47:03] <webBuilder> I'll get back like in 2 min
[14:47:13] <versatiletech> yeah the url can be any url that outputs xml
[14:47:20] <versatiletech> it doesn't have to end in .xml
[14:50:45] <saulo> Cork[home] : tested, but isn't working yet. I tryed this:  $j(document).ready(function() { $j(document.getElementById('folderframe').contentDocument).ready( function() {                 $j('#folderframe').contents().find('.controls').hide();           });       });
[14:51:02] <saulo> Cork[home] : $j is jQueryno conflict
[14:51:50] <saulo> Cork[home] : this code work at bugzilla, after page load. but do not works at page header :(
[14:52:02] <webBuilder> versatiletech, does not seems my ubuntu browser happy about this change
[14:52:12] <webBuilder> versatiletech, here is the link according to the tutorial http://jsfiddle.net/YP9vC/2/
[14:54:23] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I guess on the tutorial I made a mistake some steps specially on jQuery.ajax can you tell me my error if you can please
[14:55:14] <versatiletech> webBuilder: I can't test your example since the URL is a local URL not a public one. You have a typo too. brb
[14:58:21] <versatiletech> webBuilder: http://jsfiddle.net/YP9vC/3/
[14:58:43] <gamingdroid> if I have this {... "results": [ { "name": "albert"}, {"name" : "megan"} ] } or this {... "results": { "name": "albert"} }, how can I distinguish between them? I tried instanceof Array, but that didn't work?
[14:59:03] <versatiletech> in your html you obviously need to include your jQuery library before you execute your code
[15:00:13] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: could you be more specific about what you would like to distinguish?
[15:00:40] <webBuilder> versatiletech, it did print your error message 'something happened wrong, check your ajax url or internet connection'
[15:00:46] <webBuilder> what does it mean
[15:00:52] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: I need to distinguish the content of the json within the results attribute given above.
[15:01:22] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: it appears the "results" can contain a single json, or what appears to be an array of json's....
[15:01:25] <versatiletech> webBuilder: ok so first step is to check your ajax URL
[15:01:40] <versatiletech> do you have firebug installed?
[15:01:46] <webBuilder> versatiletech, indeed
[15:02:01] <versatiletech> check your Net tab
[15:02:31] <versatiletech> check if your XML url is red
[15:02:35] <versatiletech> which indicates a 404
[15:03:37] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: any suggestions?
[15:05:26] <webBuilder> versatiletech, error message 'loadXMLDoc is not defined'
[15:05:54] <webBuilder> versatiletech, yea because I commented it
[15:05:58] <webBuilder> give me fiew sec
[15:06:02] <versatiletech> that's seems like a javascript error
[15:06:38] <skypce> hi, how can i do : if div is empty (whitout ul) doesnt show div?
[15:06:47] <icenine457> is there an official jquery-ui channel? or is freenode #jquery-ui what im looking for?
[15:09:28] <icenine457> skypce: if ( $('#mydiv').html().length == 0 ) { $('#mydiv').hide(); } something like that?
[15:09:47] <misterm> icenine457: in terms of support/discussion I don't think so, it's just here...there is a jqueryui dev channel
[15:09:54] <webBuilder> versatiletech, this is what happening loadCarousel method calls mycarousel_itemLoadCallback then mycarousel_itemLoadCallback calls mycarousel_itemLoadCallback which use to call loadXMLDoc but now we replace it with jQuery.ajax how can I can replace loadXMLDoc with your jQuery.ajax  I'm asking this for I have no clue how jQuery works that much
[15:10:00] <webBuilder> sorry for the confusing
[15:10:00] <icenine457> misterm: thx, then ill just ask my question
[15:11:53] <skypce> thank you icenine457
[15:12:16] <icenine457> hooray i helped :)
[15:12:24] <icenine457> skypce: yw
[15:14:06] <versatiletech> the success function is called whenever your AJAX call is successful, it just means do whatever I want IF AND ONLY IF it's successful. You could technically have all of your carousel code in the success function, but that wouldn't be modularizing your code. So in this case you're just sending the XML to the carousel function. You'll have to remove any instances of loadXMLDoc. You've sent the xml to the carousel function, so pass 
[15:14:06] <versatiletech> functions or have a global variable with your xml.
[15:16:29] <webBuilder> versatiletech, let me show you my xml, it might be there my problem
[15:17:14] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I have posted below the html section on http://jsfiddle.net/YP9vC/4/
[15:18:14] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I got it when the ejax hit the server the server has a print statement and it's printing that yet I was not able to see it on the client side. on the client side I still see your error message
[15:20:48] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1068834/object-comparison-in-javascript
[15:20:59] <webBuilder> versatiletech, your jQuery.ajax is hitting the server for the server is printing the long file is something is hitting it. but does not seems that function if pulling the xml out of the client
[15:21:22] <webBuilder> if = it
[15:21:38] <webBuilder> it   pulling the xml out of the client
[15:22:53] <versatiletech> webBuilder: Is the xml showing up in the next tab of firebug?
[15:23:00] <versatiletech> Net tag*
[15:23:01] <versatiletech> tab*
[15:23:03] <versatiletech> ugh
[15:23:30] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: I tried doing a Object.prototype.toString.call check, but that returned an undefined object....
[15:25:01] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I have posted for you on http://jsfiddle.net/YP9vC/4/ on the html section, but that xml is prited from the log file of the server everytime the page loads that means the jQuery.ajax is hitting the right thing yet it is not able to get it from the server side
[15:25:25] <webBuilder> versatiletech, firebag is not showing me any xml or ajax error
[15:25:57] <versatiletech> then the URL isn't outputting the XML for some reason
[15:26:11] <versatiletech> if it's not showing up in the Net tab of firebug
[15:26:19] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: turns out I made a mistake in my code, somevar.results instanceof Array, DO WORK! I appreciate your help, thank you!!! ;)
[15:26:44] <dabear> instanceof Array is bad
[15:27:02] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: that only check if it's an instance of the Array object, not to check if two objects have the same properties
[15:27:22] <dabear> use $.type() instead
[15:27:39] <webBuilder> versatiletech, so what are my options to pull that xml out of the server
[15:27:53] <dabear> ?eval $.type([])
[15:27:54] <bot-t> dabear: TypeError: $.type is not a function
[15:28:02] <dabear> ?jseval $.type([])
[15:28:03] <bot-t> dabear: TypeError: $.type is not a function
[15:28:07] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: that is all I needed and I apologize if it was unclear. Somebody else told me it was an object, not an array, thus it spawned all this... :(
[15:28:11] <dabear> `eval $.type([])
[15:28:16] <dabear> meh
[15:28:29] <dabear> didn't we have a jquery enabled bot?
[15:28:35] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: but that is a darn good question.
[15:29:00] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: didn't you want to compare two objects?
[15:30:16] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: I was told the "attribute" results contained an object, not an array. so I thought I was looking for how to distinguish what that "results" object contained. It turns out it was an array or an json object, which made the check a lot easier.
[15:30:38] <webBuilder> versatiletech, do you think my xml file is wrong
[15:30:46] <webBuilder> can you tell me if I did something wrong on my xml?
[15:31:11] <webBuilder> versatiletech, it's located http://jsfiddle.net/YP9vC/4/ on the html section the last part of it
[15:31:31] <stephenjudkins> so this is incredibly frustrating: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8101 (using requestAnimationFrame for animation instead of setTimeout) caused this http://dev.jquery.it/ticket/9381, which breaks existing functionality
[15:31:35] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I do recall you told me not to put <UPPERCASE>bllabla</UPPERCASE>
[15:31:48] <webBuilder> versatiletech, tell me if that is not apropriate
[15:32:04] <stephenjudkins> i'm frankly a bit surprised and disappointed that the jquery team put improving performance before maintaining existing functionality
[15:32:20] <versatiletech> webBuilder: Well it has to output the xml somehow be it plain xml text or a print function outputting xml, but the end result should be a URL that you could visit in your browser separately and see the XML
[15:32:45] <webBuilder> versatiletech, thank you let me try then
[15:32:54] <webBuilder> versatiletech, if i can see it locally
[15:33:03] <webBuilder> by plugi the url
[15:33:13] <stephenjudkins> does anyone suggest any workarounds or patterns to avoid this?
[15:33:37] <versatiletech> stephenjudkins: participate in fixing any bugs?
[15:34:20] <stephenjudkins> versatiletech: i'm not sure what you're asking me?
[15:35:07] <versatiletech> what are you referring to when you say "maintaining existing functionality"?
[15:36:27] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: do you have control over the structure of the JSON results?
[15:36:51] <webBuilder> versatiletech,  this is very tricky Opara pulls the data, yet firefox does not
[15:37:10] <webBuilder> versatiletech, what the hack I know you going to tell me to clean the cashe I did already
[15:37:15] <gamingdroid> versatiletech: no. if I did, I would make it consistent i.e. always return an array even if it is empty
[15:37:28] <versatiletech> webBuilder: you sending the correct headers to identify the data as XML?
[15:37:29] <stephenjudkins> versatiletech: before http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8101, animations worked a certain way when the browser window was minimized. once that enhancement was complete, animations triggered inside a minimized window queue up and start once the window is un-minimized.
[15:38:10] <webBuilder> versatiletech, what does it mean the correct header I'm sorry
[15:38:22] <versatiletech> HTTP header
[15:38:29] <webBuilder> versatiletech, yea
[15:38:34] <stephenjudkins> other people (see http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/9381) have the same issue as me. I was hoping someone could suggest a pattern to work around this issue
[15:38:40] <versatiletech> check the Net tab
[15:38:50] <webBuilder> the first thing it should do is printing the xml on alert yet is not doing that
[15:38:51] <versatiletech> it'll tell you
[15:41:11] <gamingdroid> if I was dynamically adding things to a list via ajax, what is the best practice, to add the empty <ul></ul> statically or add it dynamically at run time?
[15:42:43] <webBuilder> versatiletech, this what I get
[15:42:49] <webBuilder> versatiletech,  X-Requested-With	XMLHttpRequest
[15:43:11] <webBuilder> but I do not see any xml file on net tab should I see xml file dumped in to the net tab too ?
[15:43:27] <Ogredude> hey the default speed on .fadeOut() is good enough for me, is there a way to keep that and still give it a callback?
[15:44:20] <versatiletech> stephenjudkins: yeah that's what I mean if something's happening that you don't like and you wish it to be fixed quickly, fix it and contribute to jQuery. jQuery is open source and driven by the community. The programmers that work on it don't get paid to do so. For instance do what lrbabe did in that bug ticket. He fixed the issue and request it to be included in jQuery. It's all a team effort.
[15:44:42] <webBuilder> hey versatiletech thank you for your teaching I even learn something cool
[15:45:00] <stephenjudkins> versatiletech: "open source" doesn't mean "people can't complain about it".
[15:45:09] <phishbot> how do you pass variables between inline pages with jquery mobile?
[15:45:14] <webBuilder> versatiletech, I select the responce tab and I got my xml but is not printing on alert why?
[15:45:15] <Hoe``> I'd got a large list of ID's that are stored like <li data-id="foo"></li> and I need to find every li element which has an Id inside of this array
[15:45:25] <Hoe``> my main concern is selector speed, does anyone have any advice?
[15:45:40] <Hoe``> Would I be wiser moving it over to a class, too?
[15:45:42] <versatiletech> sure, but if you want to complain about it, then do something about it ;)
[15:45:43] <webBuilder> versatiletech, simple it might not be the correct format right ?
[15:46:11] <stephenjudkins> versatiletech: patronizing tone isn't appreciated, either. i've committed to open-source projects on many occasions, and i've learned it's always much better to learn the lay of the land and ask people for help then to immediately start writing a patch
[15:46:16] <webBuilder> versatiletech, and others how you can check if you ave a correct xml format ?
[15:46:22] <webBuilder> is there anyway to know ?
[15:46:57] <stephenjudkins> i'm not particularly familiar with what's going on, and I hope someone here was.
[15:47:08] <Hoe``> ohh, hmm, i should build a cache of them
[15:48:38] <versatiletech> stephenjudkins: my point is contribute. If there's something you don't like bring it up in a ticket. Your point may be valid. Someone may have more insight than you and give you feedback. At that point you can choose to create a patch if it's appropriate or just create a patch for yourself. Or someone may choose to work on the ticket.
[15:49:02] <stephenjudkins> versatiletech: yes, i'd LOVE to contribute
[15:49:07] <stephenjudkins> someone help me understand the problem first?
[15:50:11] <madprops> how can I prepend html directly into a container?
[15:50:16] <madprops> $('code') ?
[15:51:25] <GaiusOctavius> How can I force that fadeIns allways happen once at a time?
[15:51:44] <GaiusOctavius> I tried this, but still there can be two fadeIn with no fadeOut between:
[15:51:46] <gamingdroid> I know some very very rudimentary Javascript and need to learn JQuery. Is it recommended to start from scratch at JavaScript, or do one usually pick it up as one goes along with JQuery?
[15:52:05] <versatiletech> stephenjudkins: if it's regarding jQuery core and its development it's probably more appropriate to ask in #jquery-dev. If there's no response, check to make sure there isn't a ticket already open. If there isn't, open up a new ticket.
[15:52:08] <GaiusOctavius> http://pastebin.com/m33Bpatu
[15:52:31] <systemfault> gamingdroid: If you don't want to suck with jQuery, you must know CSS and Javascript
[15:52:49] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: yep
[15:52:54] <versatiletech> what he said
[15:53:16] <gamingdroid> So learn JavaScript well... before attempting jQuery
[15:53:28] <misterm> gamingdroid: yes, that would be ideal
[15:53:59] <misterm> gamingdroid: you will use jQuery most effectively when you have an understanding of how it works, why it works, and what it's for
[15:54:00] <gamingdroid> any recommended resources to get me going?
[15:54:29] <systemfault> gamingdroid: eloquent javascript is a good online tutorial
[15:54:50] <systemfault> gamingdroid: Then after, take a few minutes to learn/relearn CSS2 and CSS3 selectos
[15:54:53] <systemfault> *selectors
[15:55:08] <versatiletech> webBuilder: the Content-Type should be text/xml
[15:55:26] <versatiletech> what's server-side language are you using?
[15:56:33] <gamingdroid> systemfault: that's quite a list! I know CSS, but not CSS2/3....
[15:56:54] <webBuilder> versatiletech, thank you for answering I know you getting hammered by question, yet it is the responce tab return my xml file, then I took that and put it on xml validator on w3c it's said No error found
[15:57:00] <systemfault> gamingdroid: CSS3, you only need the selector part.
[15:57:11] <webBuilder> versatiletech, yet your jQuery.ajax is not printing it :(
[15:57:13] <webBuilder> :(
[15:58:04] <webBuilder> versatiletech, sorry mine it said text/html hoooooooooooo
[15:58:15] <versatiletech> ok good
[15:58:16] <webBuilder> versatiletech, how can I can change it
[15:58:17] <webBuilder> :)
[15:58:21] <webBuilder> thank you versatiletech
[15:58:25] <webBuilder> thank you so much
[15:59:23] <versatiletech> webBuilder: so under Response Headers it says Content-Type text/xml?
[15:59:46] <webBuilder> no it said 	text/html
[15:59:57] <webBuilder> and it's coming from a just a method in java
[16:00:09] <webBuilder> do you know any trick to make it to be text/xml ?
[16:00:16] <webBuilder> than simple String
[16:00:17] <webBuilder> ?
[16:00:51] <webBuilder> versatiletech, practically this xml file is coming from a jsp page how can I can change the content type
[16:00:57] <webBuilder> versatiletech, wait I think I can find out
[16:00:58] <webBuilder> :)
[16:01:01] <webBuilder> sorry to bug you
[16:01:44] <versatiletech> :) I know very little about Java
[16:01:47] <versatiletech> but this might help
[16:01:48] <versatiletech> http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/servlet/ch05_06.htm
[16:02:35] <versatiletech> brb
[16:02:41] <gamingdroid> systemfault, misterm & versatiletech: thanks for the tip!
[16:03:11] <gamingdroid> I wonder how many people have a programming experience as opposed to design when learning javascript/jquery?
[16:03:21] <systemfault> I do.
[16:03:32] <systemfault> I'm no design guy.
[16:03:41] <iii_> hi i got a problem with installing jquery.ui (i hope i am right here even if its .ui). I get "$(".draggable").draggable is not a function" but i am pretty sure i have included everything right. (Firebug tells it's successfully loaded). Anybody got an Idea?
[16:06:29] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: I was in the middle
[16:06:45] <versatiletech> did both design and programming at the time I learned jquery
[16:07:17] <necromancer> gamingdroid: i think more programmers than designers
[16:07:22] <versatiletech> but I was more familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript so the learning curve wasn't so steep
[16:07:47] <versatiletech> gamingdroid: yw :D
[16:14:09] <rwaldron> ajpiano yt?
[16:14:28] <gamingdroid> yeah, I'm more programmer so find CSS and such nasty with all the workarounds... I'm finding JavaScript the same way even with JQuery to some extent.
[16:14:35] <skypce> hello again guys, how can i do it? please if($('.tabs').html().length == 0 ) {
[16:14:35] <skypce> 		$('h1','h3').css(width:'100%');
[16:14:35] <skypce> 	}
[16:15:18] <misterm> skypce: what is "it" that you are trying to do?
[16:15:59] <skypce> i want when does not have tabs, the width of the title h1 will set to 100%

[16:17:51] <skypce> i have the title in left and the tabs in the right inline
[16:21:12] <danst> hello guys; is there a way I can sync two animations so they would 100% sure animate together at the same time
[16:21:36] <danst> I have like two divs and I change their sizes with animate method
[16:21:50] <danst> and 70% animations are not done at the same time
[16:22:01] <danst> 70% chance *
[16:27:31] <skypce> how can i question: if a doesnt have a .class?
[16:27:34] <danst> or maybe there's something I could execute for like every frame of animation
[16:28:15] <danst> skypce: what are you trying to achieve
[16:29:05] <skypce> i want this condition for adjuts some css values
[16:31:06] <aaairc> do you guys know of a plugin that will tell you the amount of time it would take to get between two addresses driving? i was thinking of using GMAP plugin to show a Google map with the starting and ending point, but I don't think that will bring through driving time. Basically I want that simple map, and then underneath the distance away or driving time?
[16:31:07] <aaairc> thanks
[16:31:39] <danst> I think you could use google maps v3 api
[16:34:28] <devinrolsen> afternoon all.
[16:39:07] <sinuc> howdy folks, where/how can i report spam/fishy plugins? (just created an account but there doesnt seem to be such a feature, or i cant seem to find it)
[16:40:22] <misterm> sinuc: where are the plugins? Unless they're somehow listed in an official jQuery doc or something I don't think there's really anything you can do
[16:41:46] <sinuc> misterm: user submitted project (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/blowfish) - no content but a backlink to his page (find this somewhat annoying)
[16:42:35] <tuvwx> problem with datatables jquery plugin(s): enable datatables' ColReorder and ColVis plugins (using jquery-ui, if it makes any difference), multi-column sorting would work fine until i do any column reordering (move columns) - then it behaves in a weird way. can't figure out what it actually does, but it keeps shuffling rows around somewhat inconsistently
[16:49:45] <Ogredude> ok.  I need to use replaceWith() to replace an element with a hunk-o-stuff that spans multiple lines.  How do I do that?
[16:55:22] <skypce> guys, how can i do it: if($('#-tabs-container').hasClass('.tabs')){
[16:55:22] <skypce> 		$('h1','h3').width('100%');
[16:55:51] <skypce> the class hide and show depending of if $messages have content
[16:57:00] <gf3> skypce: pretty much what you have
[16:58:08] <skypce> gf3, any solution?
[16:59:08] <sinuc> skypce: if($(this).text().length > 0).. show else hide ..?
[16:59:34] <gf3> if ( $( '#-tabs-container' ).hasClass( '.tabs' ) ) $( 'h1, h3' ).width( '100%' )
[17:00:46] <skypce> thank you guys i will test
[17:00:48] <skypce> :D
[17:01:03] <ProLoser> hallo
[17:01:12] <ProLoser> what's the most efficient way to detect a mobile browser so i can disable animations?
[17:01:15] <Ogredude> apparently javascript does not like newlines in strings.  How do I use .replaceWith() to replace the selected element with a hunk of text that may or may not contain newlines?
[17:01:36] <gf3> skypce: I basically just wrote what you already had
[17:02:01] <gf3> ProLoser: for performance?
[17:02:10] <ProLoser> yes
[17:02:38] <gf3> ProLoser: use animations that take advantage of native rendering
[17:03:05] <ProLoser> such as?
[17:04:36] <gf3> ProLoser: CSS animations
[17:05:03] <ProLoser> hmm..
[17:05:21] <ProLoser> can i do slideUp() and slideDown()?
[17:05:24] <gf3> ProLoser: there are several plugins: http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[17:05:28] <Ogredude> ok so if nobody knows how to make replaceWith() happy with multi-line replacement, I'll just do it ugly for the time being and make sure my template renders all on one line.
[17:05:33] <gf3> ProLoser: you can do virtually anything
[17:06:09] <ProLoser> simply adding that plugin will optimize performance? how come it's not core?
[17:07:06] <gf3> IIRC something similar is coming to core
[17:07:18] <gf3> I don't recall, I haven't been following this stuff too closely
[17:08:04] <ProLoser> that's pretty impressive
[17:08:04] <ProLoser> thanks
[17:08:13] <gf3> np
[17:08:20] <ProLoser> my site is crap for animating on mobile platforms lol
[17:08:30] <gf3> should be snappy on mobile as long as you're not going crazy with animations
[17:08:52] <ProLoser> in fact, having stuf scrolling under a box shadow alone causes problems
[17:09:03] <ProLoser> gf3, deansofer.com
[17:09:45] <black_warlock> who knows how to setup a progress bar for an upload form ?

[17:10:02] <black_warlock> =(
[17:13:54] <black_warlock> i have found one

[17:20:38] <black_warlock> in wut lenguage is written?
[17:20:44] <ProLoser> gf3, the plugin appears to break a lot of animations
[17:21:02] <gf3> ProLoser: you can try doing it manually

[17:26:57] <ch3mical> Hey, can anyone tell me why using $.parseXML on a pretty small XML string would cause it to hang?
[17:35:26] <aoeu256_> anybody know how to recursively edit text in a web page wihout trashing the HTML?
[17:35:42] <aoeu256_> i tried using "innerText" and contents
[17:43:35] <ezrafree> hello
[17:43:51] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me why this fading slideshow only runs once: http://jsfiddle.net/dBhhz/
[17:46:22] <ezrafree> hello!
[17:46:30] <ezrafree> quiet day today it looks like...
[17:46:35] <chipnt> ezrafree im not guru with jquery but id make a function, put that slideshow in it and at the end of the function call it again
[17:47:08] <chipnt> im sure there are also better alternatives than mine
[17:47:10] <ezrafree> chiput: hmm that just gave me an idea actually, their original code was in a function as a matter of fact
[17:47:33] <chipnt> k
[17:47:38] <ezrafree> http://snook.ca/technical/fade/fade.html <-- that's the original
[17:47:41] <beute> hey is there someone who can help me out with a jquery if statement?
[17:47:46] <ezrafree> but their example didn't use a <ul>
[17:47:57] <ezrafree> and i wanted my images in an <ul> container
[17:48:16] <ezrafree> beute: you should ask your question to see if anyone can help :)
[17:48:24] <beute> ok
[17:49:11] <chipnt> ezrafree well try calling your function again with a timer
[17:49:18] <beute> can someone help me out... im using jquery 1.5.2... I want to call an if statement that if one element if 2 elements are not focused / blur, then hide another (fadeOut) another element.
[17:49:45] <ch3mical> chipnt: that would eventually produce a race condition
[17:50:09] <chipnt> y
[17:50:17] <beute> sorry that didnt make much sense... lets just say I am trying to do this, but it wont work: if ($('#timepick').blur() && $('#timepicker').not(":focus")) {
[17:50:17] <beute>     $("#timepicker").fadeOut;
[17:50:17] <beute> }
[17:50:18] <ch3mical> beute: that's not a question, you're asking someone to write code for you
[17:50:29] <ch3mical> beute: that's a little better
[17:50:45] <ch3mical> beute: put up an example on jsfiddle
[17:50:55] <beute> ever use google calendar?
[17:51:25] <ch3mical> I don't want an example of what you are trying to emulate, I want an example of the actual problem you're running into
[17:51:29] <beute> if i had an example of code to use then i could just use that code... the only example I know of is google calendar when you go to add an event.
[17:52:06] <ch3mical> You just pasted some code... put that together in jsfiddle
[17:52:12] <beute> it seems that the code i just showed you is not working for me, to me it seems like logical code.
[17:52:14] <beute> ok sure
[17:52:49] <ch3mical> Don't just dump it in there, though, put in the example html you're trying to use that jquery on
[17:53:02] <ch3mical> So I can actually see how you're trying to use it
[17:54:53] <beute> ok yeah im coding it hold on
[17:54:57] <beute> i appreciate the help
[17:55:09] <ch3mical> ok
[17:56:05] <ezrafree> can anyone take a look at this fading slideshow and tell me why it only runs once: http://jsfiddle.net/dBhhz/
[17:57:43] <ezrafree> or maybe i should just use a plugin or something haha
[17:59:24] <beute> @chemical http://jsfiddle.net/mxwK2/ there you go
[18:00:50] <ch3mical> Give me a min
[18:00:54] <beute> i meant ch3mical: , woops
[18:00:58] <beute> sure no problem
[18:01:54] <ch3mical> beute: so what are you trying to accomplish with this?
[18:02:42] <ch3mical> ezrafree: I'll look at yours next
[18:02:45] <beute> ch3mical: if i used a blur for #timepick, it would hide if you try to scroll the time in the #timepicker div.
[18:03:14] <ch3mical> beute: ok, but what are you trying to accomplish?
[18:03:16] <beute> ch3mical: i need it to hide #timepicker only when #timepick is not focused and #timepicker is not focused
[18:03:24] <beute> it is a time selection box
[18:03:29] <beute> or i want it to be.
[18:03:47] <ezrafree> ch3mical: cool np, thanks
[18:05:06] <ch3mical> I guess I'm trying to ask, what should this do? Are you trying to populate the box with something then hide the box or are you trying to animate the list in some way... what?
[18:05:40] <sherjilozair> For some reason, .hover is not working at all in my page.
[18:05:58] <sherjilozair> Neither is simple CSS :hover
[18:06:01] <beute> eventually i will code it so when one selects an element in the div ( a li element ), it will take the value of the li and set it as the value of the form element #timepick
[18:06:14] <sherjilozair> here's a link. sherjilozair.com/wayfarer2
[18:07:55] <ezrafree> beute: http://jsfiddle.net/mxwK2/1/
[18:08:37] <beute> ezrafree: that doesnt function the way I need it to, try to scroll the elements in the div and it will hide #timepicker.
[18:08:45] <sherjilozair> I've used tr:hover in the style.css, but still, the table generated by this apge is not responding ot hover.
[18:08:52] <sherjilozair> Could someone check it out ?
[18:09:05] <sherjilozair> You have ot enter cities in the textbox to generate a table.
[18:09:27] <beute> sherjilozair, very cool project
[18:11:01] <ch3mical> beute: is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/mxwK2/2/
[18:11:50] <sherjilozair> beute: Thank you. I'd be looking for feedback too, if you're playing with it.
[18:12:34] <beute> ch3mical, kind of... but I originally had an if statement because the page the code will be used on will have many form fields and other elements... so i need some way to say "if either of both elements are not in focus, then hide #timepicker"
[18:12:41] <ch3mical> You could also use $(document).not('[id^="time"]').focus(...) to make it fade away if you click anything BUT those two
[18:13:23] <beute> a friend of mine suggested using document.activeElement... i'm not too familiar with usage of that
[18:14:34] <sherjilozair> I have just updated it with two methods of hover-hoghlighting, one is jquery and other is normal css, Its still not working.
[18:15:36] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: it looks to me like you're not creating your table markup properly
[18:15:50] <ezrafree> a table should only use <th> as the cells in the first row typically
[18:16:21] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: You're sure that is creating problem ? I'll try it out though.
[18:16:24] <ezrafree> <th> = table header (not "cell header, so to speak)
[18:16:48] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: no, i have no idea if that's creating the problem, i'm just letting you know it's not how tables are supposed to be created in proper html
[18:17:16] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: you're trying to highlight an entire row when it's hovered?
[18:17:51] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: Yes.
[18:18:19] <sherjilozair> For starters, I might want to highlight columns too, but I think that will look ugly.
[18:18:29] <sherjilozair> So, just rows for now.
[18:19:05] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: have you tried validating your css code?
[18:19:22] <ezrafree> i can see some errors off the top, like two ";" at the end of a line at the top of the style.css
[18:19:59] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
[18:20:27] <ezrafree> until it's valid, there's no telling what may trigger errors later in the file
[18:20:43] <tallisman> Anyone here :p?
[18:20:46] <beute> ch3mical, they dont do let u use those jquery functions for boolean computations? it just doesnt make sense, seems like it should work the way i thought of coding it the first time
[18:20:54] <ezrafree> tallisman: type /scan
[18:21:17] <tallisman> Permission denied :p
[18:21:26] <ch3mical> beute: that's not what it's for, no
[18:21:44] <ezrafree> tallisman: ah, sorry, guess that's just in my script :)
[18:21:50] <ezrafree> err, my irc client
[18:21:57] <beute> ch3mical, no way to use .is(":focus") either then?
[18:21:59] <tallisman> ::p
[18:22:25] <ch3mical> beute: it won't have the effect you want, no
[18:22:35] <beute> dang, i just dont get how google did it
[18:22:37] <tallisman> Anyhow, Is it actually allowed to ask javascript questions here, or is it something completely different? :]
[18:23:49] <ezrafree> tallisman: i would imagine you'd have better mileage in #javascript but that channel can be rather slow
[18:24:02] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: I validated CSS, only border-radius and opacity problem.
[18:24:03] <ezrafree> tallisman: but i will say that if you aren't using jquery, you wish you were :)
[18:24:17] <sherjilozair> said they don't exist in version 2.1
[18:24:24] <sherjilozair> But maybe I should validate my html
[18:25:15] <sherjilozair> but there is no point validating html as its being generated automatcally.
[18:25:35] <tallisman> Well I have some knowledge about jquery, it actually brought me to javascript (I don't think I'm the only one who has taken that route ;))
[18:25:46] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: when i look in firebug at it, there's no css being called for "tr" so i guess it's because you've loaded this html into the document dynamically
[18:26:48] <sherjilozair> yes I have.
[18:27:00] <sherjilozair> CSS does not apply to dynamically loaded html ?
[18:27:03] <sherjilozair> :O
[18:27:17] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: its my first time seeing this, so it's a bit confusing to me too
[18:27:43] <tallisman> But recently I have a little bit of a brain - problem considering OOP and JavaScript, you don't happen to know anything about that ezrafree?
[18:28:44] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: maybe you should add the css using jquery? like, $('tr:hover').css('background', '#777');
[18:28:48] <misterm> tallisman: jQuery [#jquery] tallisman: jQuery == javasci
[18:28:48] <misterm> [#jquery] tallisman: jQuery == javasci
[18:28:48] <misterm> [#jquery] tallisman: jQuery == javasci
[18:28:48] <misterm> [#jquery] tallisman: jQuery == javasci
[18:28:48] <misterm> [#jquery] tallisman: jQuery == javasci
[18:29:00] <ezrafree> misterm: wtf?
[18:29:01] <misterm> lol, sorry
[18:29:16] <tallisman> Something went wrong I quess xD
[18:29:16] <ezrafree> lmao and jQuery != JavaScript, at all
[18:29:20] <misterm> my irc client accidently
[18:29:33] <ohaibbq> jquery is javascript
[18:29:37] <ohaibbq> javascript is not jquery
[18:29:37] <misterm> ezrafree: what are you talking about?
[18:29:42] <ezrafree> jquery is a javascript library
[18:29:55] <misterm> exactly
[18:29:58] <ezrafree> exactly
[18:29:59] <tallisman> Jquery is build in javascript, but can be used differently.. Zend is build in php, but Zend != PHP
[18:30:15] <misterm> if you are writing "jQuery" you are actually just writing Javascript code
[18:30:29] <misterm> it's a just a library to help you do certain things in Javascript
[18:30:34] <tallisman> try to write jQuery without jQuery ;)
[18:30:38] <ezrafree> nope, you're writing jQuery
[18:30:52] <ohaibbq> not sure if troll
[18:30:57] <misterm> lol
[18:31:05] <tallisman> I'm with ezrafree on this one :p
[18:31:21] <misterm> tallisman: you'd be wrong then
[18:31:44] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: maybe you should add the css using jquery? like, $('tr:hover').css('background', '#777');
[18:31:45] <tallisman> every higher programming language - C, C++, C# is just a layer on top of another language, jQuery is a layer on top of JavaScript
[18:32:15] <misterm> tallisman: jQuery is not a layer on top of Javascript, it's largely a layer on top of the DOM
[18:32:39] <tallisman> Using build in javascript functions :p
[18:33:39] <systemfault> jQuery is just a DOM abstraction layer.. nothing more.
[18:33:39] <ch3mical> ezrafree: this will cycle them, but play around with the animations a bit, obviously this probably isn't the desired result, but it gives you an example of how to properly cycle through the images
[18:33:43] <ch3mical> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/dBhhz/1/
[18:34:06] <misterm> There's certainly a distinction to be made between writing code that uses jQuery, and writing code without it....but ultimately it's just a library and you're still working in Javascript
[18:34:22] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: That doesnt work either. :/
[18:35:39] <tallisman> systemfault, do you happen to know about object oriented programming in javascript? Because from one side I'm hearing - You should do prototyping - It's faster.. and on the other side, Literal notation ftw.. I really have no clue what is actually better.
[18:36:02] <ezrafree> ch3mical: ah fantastic, thank you. i see there's a slight pause when it goes back to the first image, but other than that it seems to be what i'm looking for, thank you
[18:36:02] <ch3mical> tallisman: javascript uses prototyping for OO
[18:36:07] <misterm> tallisman:
[18:36:24] <misterm> literal notation is an issue of syntax and has little to do with OOP per se
[18:36:35] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: I even did a console.log("HERE"); before $('tr:hover').css('background', '#C0C0C0');
[18:36:45] <ch3mical> ezrafree: obviously you need to tweak it a bit... I think the delay is an empty image or something
[18:37:06] <misterm> tallisman: as to what method you use for inheritence it depends on what you're doing/personal preference
[18:37:07] <systemfault> There's two ways in JS, the prototypal way or the Java-style OO hack
[18:37:08] <sherjilozair> "HERE" was logged and at that point, the html was already generated, still not working.
[18:37:40] <systemfault> Javascript itself was conceived to be prototypal but brendan's superior wanted something that resembled to java..
[18:37:50] <systemfault> So brendan had to fuck up the langage.
[18:38:16] <ch3mical> ezrafree: maybe try moving the id to the ul instead of the div, or just select for the ul not the div
[18:38:22] <ch3mical> ezrafree: that might be the issue
[18:38:25] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: I updated my website sherjilozair.com/wayfarer2
[18:38:28] <tallisman> hmm, so what the best way actually is.. var Object = function(whatever) { } Object.prototype.functionname = function() { //do something } ?
[18:38:50] <systemfault> tallisman: Why do you touch the prototype there?
[18:38:55] <systemfault> Ahhh
[18:38:57] <systemfault> NVM.
[18:39:10] <systemfault> That's the ugly classical java-style way
[18:39:24] <systemfault> And use a named function when you do that.
[18:39:29] <systemfault> Don't assign to a var
[18:39:38] <ch3mical> Yeah, then just use new
[18:39:39] <misterm> tallisman: it depends, but that's the standard way of creating objects in JS
[18:40:20] <ezrafree> ch3mical: ahh yes, i'd wondered if that was the right place for my id attr
[18:40:21] <ch3mical> misterm: the standard way is actually to define the prototypes then use new Whatever()
[18:40:27] <tallisman> ^ the ugly classical java-style way.. What style do you use systemfault ?
[18:40:33] <misterm> tallisman: you can also go the more prototypal way, but that doesn't always map well
[18:40:40] <misterm> ch3mical: yes, that is what I just said
[18:40:51] <systemfault> tallisman: Whatever style the API I'm using uses.. but I prefer the prototypal way.
[18:40:59] <ch3mical> misterm: I thought you were talking about something else, then
[18:41:00] <beute> anyone have any suggestions on another channel to send me to? etc?
[18:41:06] <beute> this issue is such a headache
[18:41:14] <ch3mical> beute: now what?
[18:41:20] <beute> i didnt get it working ye
[18:41:21] <beute> yet*
[18:41:32] <ch3mical> beute: what was wrong with the fade out method I showed you?
[18:41:38] <beute> which?
[18:41:53] <beute> $(document).not('id=timepick').focus(function() {
[18:41:54] <beute>     $('#timepicker').fadeOut();
[18:41:54] <beute> });
[18:41:54] <beute> ?
[18:42:05] <ezrafree> could be just irony that someone named "misterm" is trying to tell us that jquery is javascript? :)
[18:42:26] <systemfault> beute: The selector in the not(), I'd be surprised if it's valid.
[18:42:26] <tallisman> (systemfault, do you have an example online?)
[18:42:30] <misterm> ezrafree: how is that ironic?
[18:42:38] <ch3mical> beute: I never told you to do that, but no that's not it
[18:42:39] <systemfault> 2 seconds
[18:42:58] <ch3mical> ezrafree: jquery IS javascript
[18:43:11] <beute> i'm not an expert with javascript, i try to learn as  i go along.
[18:44:26] <misterm> beute: don't we all
[18:44:35] <beute> haha
[18:44:52] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/mxwK2/2/
[18:45:25] <ch3mical> beute: again, just change your selectors if you don't want it running off just what the example uses
[18:45:40] <beute> that example didnt work because it requires too much repeat code, one for each other element on the page
[18:45:58] <ch3mical> beute: no it doesn't, you just are thinking about it the wrong way
[18:46:01] <ezrafree> ch3mical: i see what's happening, now. that blank space is while it's showing the first image.
[18:46:09] <ch3mical> beute: you just need to utilize the selectors
[18:46:24] <ch3mical> ezrafree: fixed it?
[18:46:30] <sherjilozair> FUCK !
[18:46:35] <ezrafree> ch3mical: not yet, looking into it.
[18:46:35] <sherjilozair> problem with the z-index !!!!
[18:46:39] <ch3mical> sherjilozair: calm the fuck down
[18:46:41] <sherjilozair> I cant believe it !
[18:46:42] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: don't think this is a cursing channel
[18:46:49] <systemfault> tallisman: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3038312/gameboy.js Small example..
[18:46:49] <sherjilozair> oh sorry.
[18:46:53] <ch3mical> ezrafree: damn right. shit.
[18:46:54] <beute> ch3mical: hmmm....
[18:46:57] <ezrafree> some folks here have kids and such
[18:47:07] <sherjilozair> very sorry.
[18:47:09] <ch3mical> Yeah, the kids might hear you
[18:47:13] <sherjilozair> lol
[18:47:24] <sherjilozair> but anyway
[18:47:26] <ch3mical> Keep your damn voice down
[18:47:27] <ezrafree> turn down the volume on that monitor! i'm trying to rear youngins over here!
[18:47:28] <tallisman> seems very small systemfault, it also seems very cool ;)
[18:47:51] <systemfault> tallisman: I'm a rebel so I don't use semi-colons for my personal projects...
[18:48:01] <ch3mical> systemfault: I hate you ^^
[18:48:03] <systemfault> tallisman: But it should give you a small idea.
[18:48:10] <sherjilozair> ezrafree: I had z-index set to -10, which was making the hover not work.
[18:48:12] <tallisman> (why the "use strict" on top of the page?)
[18:48:24] <ezrafree> sherjilozair: ahhh, yes, that would do it :) missed that, sorry haha
[18:48:33] <ch3mical> "use strict" AND no semicolons?
[18:48:35] <ch3mical> Sheesh
[18:48:40] <beute> i wish i could just find the code that google used on their website, so much easier to find out how they did this
[18:48:43] <systemfault> ch3mical: ES5 for the win :)
[18:49:05] <ch3mical> ;)
[18:49:08] <systemfault> tallisman: It enables the ecmascript 5 strict mode on engines that supports it.
[18:49:17] <systemfault> tallisman: More and better diagnostics.
[18:49:40] <tallisman> And engines that support it are Gecko and Webkit? for instance?
[18:49:43] <systemfault> tallisman: You can't write to the global object without wanting it in strict mode for example.
[18:49:54] <systemfault> tallisman: Recent V8 and gecko, yes.
[18:50:56] <systemfault> ?eval (function() { x = 10; })()
[18:50:57] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[18:51:07] <systemfault> ?eval "use strict"; (function() { x = 10; })()
[18:51:08] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[18:51:10] <systemfault> Hmm
[18:51:29] <dwarder> i want to have two autocomplete fields, and one is dependant on first, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete anyone has done it before?
[18:51:43] <tallisman> lol @the opcodes
[18:52:02] <systemfault> :)
[18:53:14] <ezrafree> ch3mical: lint is giving me the error that "you've used the same selector more than once"
[18:53:46] <ch3mical> So fix it? :P
[18:53:53] <ezrafree> working on it :D
[18:54:15] <ezrafree> i tried moving the function to outside of the document ready, but that just made things worse haha
[18:54:28] <ch3mical> Probably not a good idea
[18:54:44] <ch3mical> You can move stuff outside of that which doesn't use jquery, if you want
[18:54:56] <ch3mical> I usually put global variable/functions above there
[18:55:32] <ch3mical> Otherwise it fucks up their scope
[18:57:37] <gf3> orrrrrr
[18:57:42] <gf3> you can just ignore JSLint
[18:58:04] <ezrafree> i'm okay with that if i can get the slideshow to work properly :)
[18:59:22] <ch3mical> I think jslint is a good way for beginners to learn better practices
[18:59:36] <ch3mical> So I try not to discourage its use
[18:59:56] <ch3mical> But also you have to know which options to set to use jslint properly
[19:00:21] <ezrafree> ch3mical: yeah i don't take everything lint tells me to heart, but i agree it's helped me learn a lot
[19:00:50] <ch3mical> :)
[19:02:02] <ezrafree> hrm how to fix this! haha
[19:02:46] <ezrafree> when it shows the first one again, it shows a blank space for 3 seconds instead of the first image again...
[19:03:02] <ch3mical> ezrafree: jsfiddle your latest
[19:04:51] <ezrafree> http://jsfiddle.net/dBhhz/2/
[19:05:03] <tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/ <-- I guess I failed my first attempt >.<, trying a whole different style all the sudden blew my brains.. lol
[19:05:12] <ezrafree> i put back all my jquery changes, since none of them worked =/
[19:07:49] <ezrafree> if (myIndex === cycle[0]) { $(this).fadeOut(); $(this).next('li').fadeIn(); } <-- i think this section is the problem
[19:08:06] <ezrafree> from what i can tell, that's fading out the first image
[19:13:20] <black_warlock> gosh
[19:13:43] <black_warlock> why jquery write c:\fakepath\myfile.jpg
[19:14:18] <black_warlock> i wish to print the value inside an input form type=File
[19:14:30] <black_warlock> window.alert($("#attach1").val());
[19:15:13] <black_warlock> instead to write the client side path it writes fakepath O.o
[19:16:17] <tallisman> .val() probably will do the trick.. if it doesn't the following might be the reason
[19:16:41] <tallisman> I don't think there is any real legitimate way to access this via the DOM. It would be a security risk that browsers have of late locked down on to prevent drive-by uploads. *from* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/740114/how-to-use-jquery-to-get-the-current-value-of-a-file-input-field
[19:17:49] <systemfault> I wish people would just forget alert()
[19:18:00] <ch3mical> ^5 systemfault
[19:18:14] <tallisman> Sometimes it's handy.. it's easier than writing Console.log
[19:18:16] <tallisman> :A
[19:18:29] <jaredhoyt> hey guys... i'm trying to execute an animate() *after* two other concurrent animate()s are complete ... is this a case for deferred objects?
[19:18:38] <tallisman> nonetheless I use console.log xD
[19:18:44] <ch3mical> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/dBhhz/3/
[19:18:49] <jaredhoyt> and if so, anyone have a tutorial on these things in layman's terms?
[19:18:54] <misterm> eh, saving a couple chars is not worth all the hassels
[19:18:58] <black_warlock> well i dont really need the path
[19:19:17] <black_warlock> how can i just get the file name  ?
[19:19:18] <ch3mical> ezrafree: it was because of .next
[19:19:50] <ch3mical> black_warlock: split
[19:19:54] <black_warlock> on mozilla just the file name pop , on chrome pop c:\fakepath\myfile.jpg
[19:20:35] <__machine> sadmicrowave: figured out how to override/extend an existing 3rd party function... http://dpaste.com/569536/
[19:20:36] <tallisman> you could just strip of the c:\fakepath using string functions..
[19:21:19] <ch3mical> black_warlock: filename = filename.split('\\')[file.name.split('\\').length-1];
[19:21:31] <tallisman> There ya go :p
[19:22:12] <black_warlock> but the path should change on different browsers.....this sux =(
[19:22:31] <ch3mical> black_warlock: that should give you just the filename regardless
[19:22:56] <black_warlock> who tell me opera will not write c:\yourmomisfat\yourdadisstupid\yourbrother\is\myfile.jpg
[19:23:11] <ezrafree> ch3mical: ahh, okay, this is getting better now at least, haha... now it just hangs on the last image for twice as long, and then shows the second image (skipping first image)
[19:23:15] <black_warlock> :D
[19:23:30] <ch3mical> It splits the path on \ and grabs only the last item from the array... actually filename.split('\\').pop() would be even cleaner
[19:23:30] <tallisman> *I hate glasfiber.., my arms tickle like crazy*
[19:23:52] <ch3mical> ezrafree: doesn't do that for me
[19:23:52] <black_warlock> lemme try
[19:25:06] <rastof> i have a count down timer and i was wondering if anyone could help me display a message after the count down has expired? code -> http://jsfiddle.net/6mZ44/
[19:25:54] <black_warlock> it is fine :D
[19:25:56] <black_warlock> tks
[19:26:05] <black_warlock> what does mean the string ?
[19:26:12] <black_warlock> .pop()
[19:26:21] <ch3mical> Takes the last element in the arraty
[19:26:25] <ch3mical> array*

[19:29:56] <ch3mical> Anyway, that will work any time, if it isn't working the problem is something else
[19:30:43] <KingDosser> kborchers: You wouldn't happen to be on right now would you? :P
[19:31:08] <ezrafree> ch3mical: can you explain why you used myIndex === cycle[0] ?
[19:31:47] <ezrafree> is it counting down to 0?
[19:32:24] <ch3mical> Actually, I don't know why I did that, it should just be (i === cycle[0])
[19:32:33] <ch3mical> remove the var myIndex
[19:33:17] <tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/ <-- I am unable to see why my variables are all undefined.. O.o..
[19:33:42] <tallisman> Even if I give them a value.. lol
[19:34:32] <ch3mical> tallisman: how are you checking their values?
[19:34:48] <ezrafree> tallisman: looks like you didn't choose jQuery and the version, in the top right corner
[19:35:03] <ch3mical> ezrafree: he has no jquery functions there
[19:35:15] <tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/2/ <-- like that.. O.o
[19:35:36] <ch3mical> tallisman: like what?
[19:36:11] <tallisman> var c1 = new car(); console.log(c1.speed); :p
[19:36:24] <ch3mical> tallisman: where are you doing that?
[19:36:38] <systemfault> tallisman: They're local variables, not members...
[19:36:46] <tallisman> oh..
[19:36:56] <tallisman> that kinda explains..
[19:37:14] <tallisman> now I see :O
[19:38:20] <tallisman> Oh, not really :\ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3038312/gameboy.js <-- how do they become members? I don't see a this or something, anywhere
[19:38:30] <ch3mical> It's because your script is inside other script in jsfiddle, so the functions won't be global (i.e. you can't see it on the console)
[19:38:49] <ch3mical> You have to put your logging in the jsfiddle, not type it into the console
[19:39:24] <tallisman> okey
[19:39:48] <systemfault> tallisman: http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/3/
[19:40:04] <systemfault> tallisman: That code is the class way.
[19:40:10] <systemfault> The Java OO way.
[19:40:21] <tallisman> Yea, the way I'm used to do it :p
[19:40:24] <systemfault> Now, I'll make the prototypal way.
[19:44:15] <systemfault> tallisman: http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/4/
[19:44:48] <systemfault> As you can see, both speed and color as private.
[19:45:15] <systemfault> s/as/are
[19:45:44] <systemfault> You can also use the revealing pattern... 2sec
[19:47:41] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/5/
[19:47:56] <tallisman> yes, speed and color are private this way, drive and toString are not because you return them :p
[19:49:00] <tallisman> ah, this example is alot clearer about why it works that way :p
[19:50:00] <tallisman> so, you declare every function as part of a variable, and then return the functions/variables.. probably only functions because of setters&getters, you need
[19:50:36] <systemfault> Yeah :) you only "reveal" the functions you want to expose.
[19:50:51] <tallisman> I see why this method has preference
[19:51:00] <systemfault> Depends for who.
[19:51:00] <tallisman> you have more control :p
[19:51:04] <systemfault> Right.
[19:51:20] <systemfault> The classical Java-style OO way is still more popular.
[19:51:21] <ezrafree> ch3mical: yeah, you're right, my fault. it _is_ working perfectly in your example on jsfiddle... but when i put the code in my website it doesn't fade at all anymore... trying to figure out why now
[19:51:41] <tallisman> Because the classical Java-style OO way is easier to use ;)
[19:51:52] <systemfault> But Javascript itself is a lot closer to a mix of scheme + Self
[19:52:05] <systemfault> tallisman: How is that easier to use?
[19:52:21] <systemfault> tallisman: What's the difference? I just took off the "new"
[19:52:29] <ch3mical> ezrafree: good luck with that
[19:53:05] <tallisman> I don't know actually, it was one of my conclusions now I suppose, Grasping the concepts of the java-style wasn't hard for me, in general, but this style, well, I couldn't have figured it out ;)
[19:53:39] <Yakko> hey, can anyone ensure me of a good jquery version to run jquery.form with???????????
[19:53:49] <tallisman> Maybe it has something to do with previous experience :p

[19:56:17] <systemfault> They see me trollin'.... hatin'
[19:56:18] <ch3mical> Yakko: it's not trolling
[19:56:18] <tallisman> ^ Wtf
[19:56:45] <ch3mical> Yakko: trolling is when someone goes into a forum and posts something that they know will spark a heated debate and then leaves
[19:56:46] <systemfault> A troll!
[19:56:57] <tallisman> did bot-t just fail on 'trolling'?
[19:56:59] * systemfault casts acid arrow on the troll
[19:57:11] <tallisman> it's not very effective
[19:57:21] <ch3mical> systemfault: roll a saving throw?
[19:57:31] <systemfault> Fuck it then!
[19:57:40] * systemfault casts fireball on himself. :P
[19:57:55] <ch3mical> Extremely effective.
[19:57:57] <tallisman> it's super duper effective - systemfault fainted
[19:58:02] * Yakko asked in the channel if they had a plugin problem with late versions of jquery itself.
[19:58:03] <tallisman> Lawl
[19:58:10] <systemfault> The troll is still alive? :(
[19:58:15] <tallisman> Yakko, I'd say 1.4?
[19:58:48] <Yakko> yeah, I'm in between 1.3.2 and 1.4.4
[19:58:56] <systemfault> That.. is trolling http://i.imgur.com/WhfFW.jpg

[19:59:48] <tallisman> Let's do planking ya'll xD

[20:08:27] <tallisman> any CKEditor experts here? ::]
[20:08:31] <jaredhoyt> if i run two concurrent animations, how can i run a third animation once *both* have completed?
[20:08:45] <black_warlock> i have a page loaded inside an iframe normally
[20:09:00] <black_warlock> inside that page i with to load another page
[20:09:07] <black_warlock> i wish*
[20:09:14] <black_warlock> will it work ?
[20:09:47] <black_warlock> the page inside iframe has a div id="progress"
[20:10:31] <RobertV> systemfault, thanks. caught it.
[20:10:32] <black_warlock> i have to call inside that div $('#progress').load('anotherpage.htm')
[20:10:33] <jaredhoyt> black_warlock: is the page loaded within the iframe on the same domain as its parent?
[20:10:38] <systemfault> RobertV: :)
[20:10:42] <hekin> hi, I'm using jQuery-UI datepicker, and i want to show "Today" in the input if the user selects TODAY
[20:10:52] <KingDosser> I have this function: http://pastie.org/private/wsebckljrw8bdmh53oiovg. But it appears that I am overwriting data when I send multiple ajax calls, could this be the case?

[20:13:36] <black_warlock> whoooohooooooooo
[20:13:45] <black_warlock> it works for GAWD !
[20:13:48] <black_warlock> :O
[20:15:52] <ch3mical> But only for gawd.
[20:16:11] <Yakko> j git
[20:23:29] <tallisman> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/Jm4Pp/6/ <-- A little example class ( A pretty default one) using your 'straightforward' method.. what do you think?
[20:25:08] <systemfault> tallisman: You're mixing this.x and x
[20:25:18] <systemfault> Also, you use new when you don't need
[20:26:00] <systemfault> in offset, it should be this.x and this.y
[20:26:11] <systemfault> In toString too
[20:26:34] <tallisman> yea, you're right, I messed up in 'this'
[20:26:47] <systemfault> And you can remove all "new"
[20:27:13] <tallisman> var p1 = Point(10); like that O.o?
[20:27:55] <tallisman> or in the class itself?
[20:28:29] <systemfault> Yes.
[20:29:10] <tallisman> I didn't know it wasn't needed in class-context :p
[20:29:36] <tallisman> btw, do you use the this keyword?
[20:29:49] <systemfault> tallisman: depends on the case.
[20:30:34] <systemfault> You might like the advanced javascript video by crockford.
[20:33:55] <tallisman> and, I'm afk for about 1,5 hours xD
[21:07:35] <ch3mical> In case anyone was wondering, I found a work around for sending XML with namespaces in jQuery AJAX requests... https://plus.google.com/112556850082362131447/posts/1apok7SvMFF
[21:14:25] <vladikoff> nice ch3mical!
[21:14:58] <snover> thanks, vladikoff. thadikoff.
[21:16:24] <tallisman> +1 & following ch3mical ^^
[21:16:48] <abjorn> hola qweriers
[21:16:49] <bot-t> (52 hours 9 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn lololol where you been bro
[21:17:01] <tallisman> :]
[21:17:08] <abjorn> lol imsky
[21:17:47] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky I've been sailing the pacific in search of the elusive wiggleback whale
[21:17:47] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[21:18:13] <ch3mical> Thanks guys :)
[21:18:29] <tallisman> this.y = y || 0; <-- if y == undefined, why doesn't it work? :A
[21:18:57] <ch3mical> tallisman: what is "this"? That could be your problem
[21:19:44] <tallisman> yea, it is the object it is in.. I don't see how it could be interfearing though :p
[21:20:15] <tallisman> It was indeed this.
[21:20:23] <tallisman> without this. it does work :p
[21:20:31] <tallisman> thanks ch3mical ^^
[21:20:46] <ch3mical> Anytime
[21:21:00] <tallisman> (Any clue why it did that btw?)
[21:21:48] <ch3mical> Not sure, I figure it might not be the right type of object
[21:21:59] <ch3mical> If I saw your code I might know more
[21:22:35] <nprice> I am trying to hack something together with javascript because I'm trying to add a feature to a php script that's been ioncube'd, and i could use a little bit of help
[21:22:55] <ch3mical> Just ask your question
[21:23:06] <nprice> Typing it out, just explaining the situation
[21:23:10] <nprice> i'm not asking to ask
[21:23:13] <nprice> lol
[21:23:25] <tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/p2dGp/
[21:24:02] <nprice> anyways, I have a string, and a <select> with several <option>s in it.  what I need to do is figure out which <option> in the <select> matches my current string, and find the previous and next <option>s
[21:24:09] <ch3mical> tallisman: are you expecting this to = Point ?
[21:24:19] <nprice> basically i need to pull data out of a <select> and throw it into a list
[21:24:20] <tallisman> yes :p
[21:24:32] <ch3mical> tallisman: I *think* (could be wrong here) that because "this" is in that function, Point is out of scope
[21:24:33] <tallisman> or at least to self, which is point
[21:24:39] <nprice> most ass-backwards thing i've ever had to do
[21:24:52] <ch3mical> tallisman: Try setting "this" to a variable before the function and then use the variable
[21:25:18] <ch3mical> ?p @ nprice
[21:25:19] <bot-t> nprice, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:25:28] <nprice> i have no code.
[21:25:30] <nprice> thank you.
[21:25:38] <tallisman> but doesn't that mean 'this' shouldn't be used at all?
[21:25:40] <ch3mical> You have a select...
[21:25:46] <ch3mical> That counts as code
[21:25:53] <nprice> do you really want me to paste a generic select on pastebin
[21:26:11] <tallisman> If you please ^_^
[21:26:14] <tallisman> Lol
[21:26:18] <nprice> i'm sure you're familiar with HTML forms and the concept i'm using, is it really necessary
[21:26:42] <tallisman> nprice ?val
[21:26:49] <tallisman> bot-t..
[21:26:51] <tallisman> ?val
[21:26:51] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:27:26] <ch3mical> nprice: well you also say you have a string... I can only assume you have SOME code written out, unless you are coming up with the entire concept (in vivid detail) in your head before you've written a single line of it
[21:27:36] <tallisman> .val() get's the current select option value
[21:27:54] <nprice> yes, i want to pull the OTHER values from the selects
[21:27:58] <ch3mical> nprice: see ?.index()
[21:27:58] <bot-t> nprice, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[21:28:12] <tallisman> ah, then it is ^
[21:28:15] <ch3mical> nprice: you can use .index to get the index of the selected option, the +1 and -1 that index
[21:28:20] <ch3mical> then*
[21:28:24] <nprice> sweet
[21:28:28] <nprice> does .index wrap?
[21:28:36] <ch3mical> nprice: also see ?:eq
[21:28:37] <bot-t> nprice, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[21:28:53] <ch3mical> nprice: Do you mean chain?
[21:29:00] <nprice> probably :)
[21:29:16] <ch3mical> Read the API doc from the link, it will explain
[21:29:26] <ch3mical> It's very easy to use
[21:29:29] <nprice> if i try to do -1 on the index and it doesn't exist, will it wrap around to the end?  if not, not a big deal to code
[21:29:43] <ch3mical> Oh, I see what you mean. And no
[21:29:49] <nprice> ok cool
[21:29:56] <ch3mical> You'll have to handle for that yourself
[21:30:15] <nprice> and just so we're clear i want to be able to pull "lol, autism, lorez" from this http://pastebin.com/qBLusVP6
[21:30:45] <nprice> this is so retarded and backwards to have to do it this way
[21:31:04] <ch3mical> *shrug*
[21:31:19] <ch3mical> There are worse things
[21:31:21] <nprice> true
[21:31:24] <nprice> at least it'll work
[21:31:28] <ch3mical> tallisman: does this do what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/p2dGp/1/
[21:31:55] <ch3mical> tallisman: notice I didn't change the "this" that aren't inside a function
[21:32:46] <ch3mical> Normally, those "this" inside of nested functions will be in scope, but I assume you're getting those methods using OO, which means you are leaving the scope of the parent
[21:32:50] <systemfault> That code is weird...
[21:33:00] <systemfault> The "this" doesn't really make sense there.
[21:33:22] <tallisman> yea, I noticed, if it doesn't refer to itself, it is not worth using..
[21:33:28] <ch3mical> Yeah, I'm not really sure what it's doing
[21:33:50] <tallisman> btw, ch3mical, it does not work btw ;), But that doesn't matter, I've refrained from using this
[21:34:02] <ch3mical> tallisman: if I could see how Point is used, I might have a better idea of a solution
[21:34:30] <tallisman> point is just going to be x and y :p
[21:34:38] <ch3mical> ok
[21:34:44] <systemfault> tallisman: http://jsfiddle.net/p2dGp/2/
[21:34:49] <ch3mical> A coordinate, right?
[21:35:25] <tallisman> yes
[21:35:27] <ch3mical> Aha, see you lost scope because you were using new
[21:35:36] <ch3mical> Nice one, systemfault
[21:35:48] <ch3mical> I hadn't read all the way down
[21:35:48] <systemfault> There's a typo in substract :P
[21:35:57] <systemfault> = instead of -
[21:36:05] <systemfault> But it's not my fault
[21:36:08] <tallisman> thanks systemfault, I should not have used that in the global scope, typo?
[21:36:14] <ch3mical> What is "substract"? :P
[21:36:29] <systemfault> tallisman: What do you mean?
[21:36:56] <ch3mical> tallisman: replace the - with =
[21:37:05] <systemfault> And offset is evil to me
[21:37:16] <tallisman> actually I had to replace = with - :p
[21:37:27] <systemfault> tallisman: Yes, that was the problem
[21:37:51] <ch3mical> That's what I meant
[21:37:57] <ch3mical> XD
[21:38:03] <tallisman> and subtract.. good one..
[21:38:09] <tallisman> had to google it.. geez xD
[21:38:12] <systemfault> tallisman: Try to avoid mutability whenever possible.
[21:38:53] <systemfault> (offset is EVIL :P )
[21:39:36] <tallisman> on the other hand, this was a default class i've wrote to try the system out ;), meaning that that offset class is not my idea :p
[21:39:54] <tallisman> it's from c#, where the point structure does have offset
[21:40:08] <systemfault> In ES5, you could even freeze the object if you wanted
[21:40:31] <tallisman> What is ES5 btw? as a sidenote ;P
[21:40:43] <tallisman> If I google it it is some sort of hackers foundation..
[21:41:12] <tallisman> ah, ecma
[21:41:16] <systemfault> What we call "javascript" is really ECMAscript.
[21:41:26] <tallisman> Yea :p
[21:41:31] <systemfault> Javascript is Mozilla's implementation of ECMAscript
[21:41:41] <systemfault> A "dialect"
[21:41:47] <systemfault> jscript is another one.
[21:41:49] <tallisman> Didn't know you were refering to the EcmaScript Standard 5
[21:42:07] <systemfault> ecmascript 5 is the latest revision
[21:42:28] <systemfault> supported by firefox, chrome and IE9 (I think)
[21:42:29] <tallisman> jScript is the thing I hate most..
[21:42:33] <tallisman> so much extra work xD

[22:51:41] <lkeijser> hi, i'm having troubles getting a page to reload when closing colorbox: http://dpaste.com/569627/  the page keeps on reloading without stopping :)
[22:55:03] <systemfault> lkeijser: Well. My guess is that onClosed should be a function.
[22:55:26] <systemfault> Not a line of code that is immediately executed.
[22:55:32] <lkeijser> aha
[22:55:48] <systemfault> so.. replace location.reload with function() { location.reload(); }
[22:55:54] <lkeijser> i'm a total jquery (or js, for that matter) newbie ..
[22:56:12] <lkeijser> okay let me try that
[22:56:13] <systemfault> Nothing wrong with being a newbie.
[22:57:26] <lkeijser> oh nice, it works, thanks :)
[22:57:38] <systemfault> :)
[22:57:46] <lkeijser> in the docs it says 'a callback' .. is that always a function?
[22:57:50] <systemfault> Yes
[22:57:59] <systemfault> A callback is always a function :)
[22:58:00] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to select the next item in a list from the scope of the original item.  $(this).next()...sortof...
[22:58:16] <systemfault> Have you tried?
[22:58:40] <Whirl3d> systemfault, are you talking to me? Cause yes, I've been trying for about a week now.
[22:58:46] <versatiletech> Whirl3d: $(this).nextAll()?
[22:59:00] <versatiletech> oh you want only the next one
[22:59:16] <versatiletech> it depends on the structure of your HTML
[22:59:37] <Whirl3d> The problem is that I am attaching a dom element to a visible div when it's "current" and the other "peers" are attached to an invisible div
[22:59:52] <Whirl3d> so using next() and nextAll to traverse the dom isn't going to work.
[23:00:16] <versatiletech> yeah you'll probably have to traverse a little bit differently
[23:00:23] <Whirl3d> Currently I assign indeces to each item and store the index in their data object
[23:00:53] <systemfault> Whirl3d: We don't know what you're trying to achieve :/
[23:00:56] <versatiletech> it's hard to assume what your HTML looks like
[23:01:13] <Whirl3d> np. gimme a second. I'll make a quick fiddle
[23:01:17] <versatiletech> jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com your intention
[23:01:18] <Whirl3d> thx for your help.
[23:01:18] <versatiletech> yeah
[23:16:00] <rastof> can someone help me with my if else statement http://jsfiddle.net/6mZ44/1/
[23:16:17] <rastof> do i have the wrong condition
[23:16:56] <systemfault> rastof: That's awful.
[23:17:13] <rastof> :( lol i'm new to this
[23:17:39] <mconstantine> rastof: == rather than =
[23:17:46] <systemfault> Yeah :)
[23:17:52] <systemfault> = is to assign
[23:18:01] <systemfault> == is to compare (=== too)
[23:19:00] <rastof> i tried that == how do i make it dislpay "Your time is up" when the time has expired
[23:19:21] <rastof> i get negative numbers when its expired with ==
[23:20:13] <systemfault> rastof: The "if" is only done 1 time at the beginning
[23:20:54] <systemfault> To be honest, I don't even understand why you seek help here :P There's nothing jquery with that code
[23:22:56] <rastof> is it javascript? i just want to be able to display "Your time is up" and stop the countdown once the desired time has been reached
[23:25:20] <systemfault> I'd probably use setTimeout :P
[23:26:04] <systemfault> But there's so much wrong in that code that I would read a javascript tutorial if I were you.
[23:27:58] <rastof> lol ok
[23:29:18] <Whirl3d> okay, here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zb95j/8/
[23:30:45] <Whirl3d> It's of course, a gross oversimplification, but it demonstrates the issue I am having with next and prev selectors
[23:34:29] <r500> can i  have array of dropdown folm elements ?
[23:35:46] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I'm checking
[23:36:12] <versatiletech> Whirl3d: why don't you use the href, drop the hash symbol and use it to show search for the div's ID?
[23:36:57] <versatiletech> wait
[23:36:59] <versatiletech> lol
[23:37:05] <versatiletech> you're already done that
[23:37:06] <Whirl3d> pfew, I was doing that
[23:37:07] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me, can you change jquery code from right wihtin firebug?
[23:37:12] <ezrafree> like, and then run it
[23:37:38] <Whirl3d> So, I could update next and prev in the changePage function
[23:37:50] <Whirl3d> and give them explicit hrefs
[23:38:51] <Whirl3d> right now, I just keep an indexed array of pages and store the index in each pages' data object
[23:40:39] <systemfault> Well.. the code itself is damn weird :(
[23:40:52] <systemfault> The transfers... the appendTos..
[23:41:58] <Whirl3d> Yeah, the page items have two views. One as a thumbnail of sorts that's draggable and sortable (in the storage panel) and one that's focused. By appending them, it keeps them logically separated
[23:42:09] <Whirl3d> but at the cost of serial indexing, I guess
[23:43:07] <Whirl3d> So rather than programmatically change the elements, I just append them to their respective containers and depending on which container they are in, they are styled accordingingly
[23:44:27] <Whirl3d> Like I said, don't spend a lot of time on it. I have it working, but it is kind of ugly.
[23:44:41] <Whirl3d> I appreciate your help, though.
[23:50:29] <y2gay> i have a slider using version 1.3.2 on two versions of a site im building. on one version it is putting a gap between each image in the slider, which is messing up the alignment every time it slides. any idea what might cause that?
[23:51:26] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me how to get the images in this content slider to automatically show the first one again without rewinding? http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/
[23:51:50] <ezrafree> you can also see an example here if you prefer: http://www.websightdesigns.com/demos/slider-thumbs-down-clickable/
