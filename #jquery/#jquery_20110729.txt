[00:00:50] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: if you think you know better for this.
[00:01:25] <coldhead> if this were my project i'd just redo the JS over
[00:01:28] <coldhead> in a nice simple way
[00:01:36] <coldhead> rather than try to debug this
[00:01:47] <KineticColor> @charged_bolt Do you have any insight on how to solve my problem?
[00:02:15] <coldhead> if you can put a working demo up on jsfiddle someone will rewrite it for you
[00:02:19] <coldhead> or help you
[00:02:23] <coldhead> people love to do that
[00:03:16] <ShawnRisk> if you want to go ahead
[00:04:55] <KineticColor> Morning guys:
[00:04:56] <KineticColor> Anyone want to help me understand why http://kineticcolor.com/Test/page1.html works but http://kineticcolor.com/index.html doesnt -- Sorry, I know why it doesnt work, because my content is being pulled by another script, so to rephase: How do I make the latter work

[00:14:36] <bionic_tiger> @as*.com
[00:14:41] <grEvenX> Any easy way to capture a click event based on that it is NOT clicked within the area of another element?
[00:14:58] <KineticColor> Why won't anyone help me gah?

[00:17:24] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: this is how i'd do it http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/1/
[00:17:40] <coldhead> that doesn't use your html because you didn't paste it for us

[00:19:16] <KineticColor> Is that a yes?
[00:19:17] <coldhead> silv3r_m00n: do you see the difference?
[00:19:24] <coldhead> & is binary, && is logical
[00:19:29] <coldhead> 1 is binary, true is logical
[00:19:51] <KineticColor> Anyone want to help me understand why http://kineticcolor.com/Test/page1.html works but http://kineticcolor.com/index.html doesnt -- Sorry, I know why it doesnt work, because my content is being pulled by another script, so to rephase: How do I make the latter work
[00:19:53] <silv3r_m00n> hmm ok
[00:20:45] <djcoin> Hey folks, i was wondering, how do you associate some behaviour to a DOM element, eg: in jquery.ui, there is a 'autocomplete' function you may use to get the 'autocompleted' element. I want to use this mechanism for my own component. But can't find out how it works.
[00:22:35] <coldhead> KineticColor: i don't understand what isn't working or what should happen but i see that clicking on the Next in the second link is causing a duplicate ID to appear in the page
[00:22:44] <coldhead> jQUery and browsers hate duplicate IDs
[00:22:54] <coldhead> so stop that happening and see if that helps
[00:23:34] <Cork> KineticColor: thats cross site js
[00:23:41] <Cork> xhr isn't allowed cross domain
[00:23:43] <bionic_tiger> go to kiss my as*.com
[00:23:55] <Cork> bionic_tiger: shutup...
[00:24:07] <KineticColor> What is cross site JS?
[00:24:14] <bionic_tiger> go to kissmyas*.com
[00:24:21] <sk8ball> why the fuck isnt the height() function working
[00:24:23] <Cork> KineticColor: your doing a call for another domain from your js
[00:24:24] <sk8ball> it returns
[00:24:30] <sk8ball> but i can't set a div height with it
[00:24:40] <KineticColor> So can I not make it load the next page?
[00:25:13] <djcoin> Ok i see
[00:25:15] <KineticColor> I am basically trying to make http://kineticcolor.com/index.html load http://kineticcolor.com/page2.html below the existing content
[00:25:20] <sk8ball> i can't set a div height with getElementByID().style.height = x
[00:25:22] <sk8ball> either
[00:25:24] <Cork> KineticColor: ugg i read wrong
[00:25:38] <sk8ball> someone please enlighten me
[00:26:58] <eml> What's the proper way to hide a dialog() (jquery-ui)?
[00:27:19] <KineticColor> @Cork any insight now?
[00:27:58] <eml> Ehm... nevermind me.
[00:28:01] <eml> dammit
[00:28:08] <sk8ball> how fucking hard can this be
[00:29:17] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: this is not working on my page doing the same thing
[00:30:37] <Cork> KineticColor: your missing the .content element
[00:31:10] <KineticColor> what .content element?
[00:31:13] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: if you paste your html on jsfiddle someone could help
[00:31:37] <Cork> KineticColor: http://kineticcolor.com/jquery.autopager-1.0.0.js
[00:32:06] <KineticColor> 			content: '.rssFeed',
[00:32:07] <Cork> KineticColor: ugg forget that
[00:32:20] <Cork> ya, it was different on the different servcers
[00:32:20] <KineticColor> The word test is loading
[00:32:26] <Cork> *servers
[00:32:33] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: the html is too long
[00:32:40] <KineticColor> If you click the next button
[00:32:47] <KineticColor> It will load the word test
[00:32:50] <coldhead> ShawnRisk: just paste the fieldset stuff
[00:33:03] <coldhead> and the relevant CSS
[00:33:04] <KineticColor> Which makes me think it is because it is not running my script prior to loading the next page
[00:33:42] <ghufran> hi. i need to show some statistics on a US map for each of the states. is there a tool which would help me do that? i found maphighlight but it only highlights stuff it looks like..
[00:34:02] <Cork> KineticColor: ok, your loading the data through js
[00:34:08] <KineticColor> Yeah
[00:34:15] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: okay
[00:34:17] <selckin> ghufran: think google visualzation api has something for that
[00:34:18] <Cork> KineticColor: but autopage loads the html and finds the element
[00:34:36] <KineticColor> Is this a fixable problem?
[00:34:47] <Cork> KineticColor: don't use autopager
[00:34:57] <Cork> just fetch the next rss feed
[00:35:23] <ghufran> selckin : okay. thanks. anything else ? google visualization is not working for me for some reason..
[00:35:39] <KineticColor> Ok that makes sense
[00:35:42] <selckin> ghufran: if you care doesn't work do you take a plane to work?
[00:35:53] <KineticColor> I am new to Javascript though
[00:35:59] <KineticColor> Could you explain to me how I would do that?
[00:36:13] <KineticColor> There will be more than 2 feeds when it is done
[00:36:19] <KineticColor> There will be like 15
[00:37:16] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/2/
[00:39:01] <coldhead> i can't look at that just now ShawnRisk but ask your question again with that link and someone will be able to help
[00:39:35] <ShawnRisk> coldhead: I really have to go bed
[00:39:37] <ShawnRisk> I am sorry
[00:39:38] <ShawnRisk> I really do
[00:40:47] <coldhead> that's okay ShawnRisk, i have to finish my work for the day
[00:40:56] <coldhead> you can use that link whenever you need to :)
[00:41:42] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to get the accordion to close the first one and open the second one.  This doesn't do that on my code but here is my code and a test that works, but needs to be modified with my code: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/2/.  How would I fix this?
[00:46:59] <L4suicide> what do you call it when you want a list of lists.. like items { name, cost, colour }, i need to add arbitrary number of these then loop through them.. im getting confused.
[00:47:17] <L4suicide> so then item[0][name] would be first ones name or something
[00:53:47] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my problem?
[01:02:15] <KineticColor> Is it possible to change the name of a rel with jquery?
[01:02:26] <KineticColor> or change an anchors id
[01:05:56] <ShawnRisk> KineticColor: any idea on my code?
[01:09:46] <KineticColor> @ShawnRisk Isn't it doing that right now?
[01:11:32] <KineticColor> http://kineticcolor.com/ Scroll to the bottom and click more, scroll to the bottom again and click more again-- nothing happens, any clue why it is not working for the second time?
[01:15:31] <iszak> KineticColor, you've got no event bound to it
[01:15:53] <iszak> well atleast none that are being triggered
[01:16:19] <KineticColor> The first event changes the id of the more link
[01:17:28] <iszak> oh I see
[01:17:34] <iszak> KineticColor, and does m3 have an event on it?
[01:18:53] <KineticColor> View the source
[01:19:29] <KineticColor> Quick code paste:
[01:19:30] <KineticColor> $(document).ready(function () {
[01:19:30] <KineticColor>         $('#m3').click(function()  {
[01:19:30] <KineticColor> 			$('#m3').attr('id', 'm4');
[01:19:30] <KineticColor>         	$('#page3').rssfeed('http://feed43.com/tsm.xml', {
[01:19:30] <KineticColor> 			limit: 15
[01:19:30] <KineticColor> 			});
[01:19:30] <KineticColor>         });
[01:19:31] <KineticColor>     });
[01:19:45] <iszak> nice.
[01:19:48] <iszak> won't work.
[01:19:53] <KineticColor> why not?
[01:20:04] <iszak> use live/delegate
[01:20:15] <KineticColor> live/delegate?
[01:20:19] <iszak> because click will only bind it to current #m3 elements not future
[01:20:23] <iszak> ?delegate @ KineticColor
[01:20:23] <bot-t> KineticColor, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:20:24] <huma> what's the deal with splitting attributes and properties in 1.6?
[01:21:06] <KineticColor> I am still confused on how I would make this work
[01:21:34] <iszak> KineticColor, because when you execute that code you pasted, it will only find current #m3 elements on the page - which there isn't any
[01:21:54] <iszak> it's only until you click it once does it change from m2 to m3, so you need to use delegate/live to bind the event to current and future m3 elements
[01:23:55] <KineticColor> @iszak: http://pastebin.com/2fr2wSwm
[01:24:05] <KineticColor> I am still a bit of a newbie
[01:24:23] <iszak> KineticColor, I can't explain it any easier..
[01:24:40] <iszak> when you bind an event e.g. via click() it only binds it to current elements on the page, not future elements that may be created etc.
[01:24:44] <KineticColor> You can show me
[01:24:56] <KineticColor> please'=
[01:25:38] <iszak> no
[01:25:43] <KineticColor> :(
[01:25:53] <iszak> ?live @ KineticColor
[01:25:53] <bot-t> KineticColor, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:25:56] <iszak> ?delegate @ KineticColor
[01:25:56] <bot-t> KineticColor, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:25:58] <iszak> read those
[01:30:38] <KineticColor> http://pastie.org/2288662 Still not working
[01:30:42] <KineticColor> What am I doing wrong?

[02:48:34] <silverd> hey guys, have a series of checkboxes that toggle different sections on a page, I also have an All option.

[02:48:48] <jorenl_> I bound a draggable drop event and a click event to one div. In FF, the click is not triggered when the div is dragged, which is what I want. Will this work like this in all browsers?
[03:02:43] <silverd> yay, resolved!
[03:04:26] <Martin_> no one has any ideas about my question?:(
[03:09:01] <DerStoffel> hey guys, can some one tell me, how to identify if an element has a child with a certain class? What i want to do is to create a function that triggers, when i hover an element, as long as this element has a child with the class 'hint' and popup a tooltip
[03:10:12] <seutje> DerStoffel: if ($element.find('.child').length) ...
[03:10:40] <DerStoffel> seutje: but isnt that a bit performance heavy, since i iterate over all children on every div i hover?
[03:13:25] <nail_> DerStoffel: $('div:has(.hint)').hover(...)
[03:16:13] <DerStoffel> seutje nail_: thx heaps, can i also check if it is a first-lvl child?!
[03:17:22] <Trisox> How many programers dose it take to change a light bulb?
[03:17:28] <Trisox> None â€“ Itâ€™s a hardare problem

[03:20:30] <DerStoffel> nail_: epic, exactly what i needed
[03:25:58] <Martin_> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$("#selector_7371 .folder").slice(0, 2).concat($("#selector_7371 .folder.selected").slice(0, 4))')
[03:26:09] <Martin_> any ideas why?
[03:26:16] <Martin_> .concat isn't in the pseudo array?
[03:31:13] <nail_> no there's no .concat method in jQuery
[03:33:19] <ShawnRisk> How do I insert the fieldset html tags into this jquery at the top of the html?  When I tried this before nothing make this work properly.
[03:33:24] <ShawnRisk> Code: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/2/
[03:43:55] <ShawnRisk> seems no one is around
[03:44:18] <Krinkle> seems someone is around
[03:44:29] <Krinkle> two actually
[03:44:35] <Krinkle> maybe even more !
[03:49:38] <ShawnRisk> maybe
[03:49:46] <ShawnRisk> Krinkle: any ideas on my code?

[03:54:12] <nail_> ShawnRisk
[03:55:15] <ShawnRisk> nail_: did you try that out?
[03:55:42] <PeterB> I show/hide form fields based on other fields - is there any way to remove my extra line of 'initialisation' code for every JS event I set up? http://pastebin.com/r97yrmJR
[03:55:53] <nail_> ShawnRisk: no, but .prepend works :)
[03:56:03] <PeterB> i.e. trigger the click function I wrote, rather than duplicate the logic?
[03:58:16] <nail_> PeterB: either declare that function somewhere and use .click(yourFunction), or trigger the click event ($('...').click()), but that will call all handlers
[03:59:23] <nail_> err, rather -- PeterB: either declare that function somewhere and use .click(yourFunction) and then call yourFunction() explicitely, or trigger the click event ($('...').click()), but that will call all handlers
[03:59:23] <ShawnRisk> nail_: I need this to relate to my code
[04:00:02] <PeterB> nail_: thanks
[04:00:27] <nail_> ShawnRisk: Is this another way of saying "do it for me" ? :)
[04:01:00] <ShawnRisk> nail_: I never said that.
[04:01:26] <nail_> so, look at .prepend() doc, that seems to be what you need

[04:03:06] <pallet> Hi all
[04:03:09] <pallet> http://internal.purchaseseal.com/popup.png
[04:03:41] <pallet> this screenshot, from looking at it, could anyone by any change identify what library it came from ?
[04:03:59] <pallet> Firebug doesn't see it on a hightlight
[04:04:52] <pallet> anyone?
[04:07:15] <Kambfhase> go into the code an search for "confirm"
[04:07:41] <pallet> Kambfhase,         var input_box = confirm("Are you sure you want to delete the contact titled '"+fname+" "+lname+"'?");
[04:07:41] <pallet>         if(input_box)
[04:08:17] <pallet> still can't see what library it is
[04:08:34] <Kambfhase> confirm is a built in browser method
[04:08:53] <pallet> oh b*gger that'll be it then
[04:09:39] <pallet> Kambfhase, can't you point me in the direction of docs about it, I'm looking for something similar, but an options box
[04:09:54] <Kambfhase> options?
[04:10:18] <pallet> that sound about right ;)
[04:11:06] <Kambfhase> only other methods i know are alert and prompt
[04:11:17] <pallet> thought so
[04:14:28] <ShawnRisk> nail_: I am not sure prepend is what I want.
[04:22:50] <ezrafree> hello
[04:26:37] <luuse> i'm trying to remove an object from a tuple by looping through it and recreating the tuple without the element like the first bit in this code: https://gist.github.com/1113645
[04:26:57] <luuse> but when i run the second statement it gives me a "ValueError: too many values to unpack"
[04:27:15] <luuse> and while i know what it means i can't find what's wrong
[04:27:22] <ezrafree> if i have a checkbox in an <li> tag, and i have click() functions for both the li as well as the checkbox, how can i prevent the clickable <li> code from running when the actual checkbox is clicked?
[04:27:32] <luuse> any tips (not really django though)?
[04:28:27] <luuse> ezrafree: i think you should have a look at this: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[04:28:46] <codecowboy> hi. wondering why this element.css() call has no effect - http://pastie.org/2289332
[04:29:24] <Stockholder> Good Morning
[04:30:30] <Cork> codecowboy: your sure element is a jquery object?
[04:31:26] <codecowboy> Cork:  um, the removeClass() call works. can I do instanceof or sth to check?
[04:31:53] <Cork> codecowboy: if removeClass works its farly sure to be correct
[04:32:29] <ezrafree> luuse: thanks! that helped me figure it out indeed :)
[04:32:58] <codecowboy> Cork:  yeah, its a newly created jquery div - http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_rendering/eventRender/
[04:33:09] <quicksilver> codecowboy: well 'top' doesn't do anything unless position is relative
[04:33:12] <quicksilver> (or absolute or fixed)
[04:34:54] <codecowboy> quicksilver:  position is absolute and top is already set. position: absolute; z-index: 8; left: 403px; background-color: rgb(51, 153, 51); height: 100px; width: 95px; top: 126px;
[04:35:07] <quicksilver> codecowboy: odd, in that case. Looks fine to me.
[04:35:08] <codecowboy> i am trying to overwrite the top
[04:35:41] <codecowboy> i guess it is being set somewhere else after I'm interfering
[04:35:52] <Cork> codecowboy: your sure its position: absolute or relative?
[04:38:03] <kuya> iv got a really weird problem with a page, there are 5 or so checkboxes, and if i tick the first, then refresh, the second checkbox becomes ticked and not the first! its always whichever checkbox is ticked plus one. iv tracked it down to me appending an input before the checkboxes. if i stop appending this input the problem goes away... anyone got any idea what might be causing it?
[04:38:29] <hrwath> is there a way to check if particular element has the event bound or not?
[04:38:46] <codecowboy> Cork it is position:absolute inside another div which is position:relative. However, I just tried setting it in another callback after the element is rendered and it worked so it must be sth in fullCalendar. thanks Cork and quicksilver
[04:40:39] <Cork> codecowboy: have you attached the element to the dom?
[04:41:02] <Cork> codecowboy: some things can be a bit wacky if you set things on a lose dom element and then attach it
[04:41:53] <codecowboy> Cork: not sure as I'm using the fullCalendar plugin and not in charge of the exact point of the attachment (or anything else really ;-)
[04:43:27] <ShawnRisk> hi Cork
[04:43:46] <Cork> ello
[04:43:46] <ShawnRisk> How do I insert the fieldset html tags into this jquery at the top of the html? Â When I tried this before nothing make this work properly. Code: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/2/
[04:45:01] <Cork> uh.. insert fieldset?
[04:47:58] <ShawnRisk> Cork: do you see the fieldset code at the top of the html part?
[04:48:19] <Cork> ya?
[04:50:14] <Back2Basics> In an ajax call is there a way that I can "Not" get the return data from the post handler?
[04:50:32] <ShawnRisk> Cork: what I want is to make that one fieldset be the first accordion, and I tried to do this on a live site and nothing happened it was all messed up with links not working and things just broken.
[04:50:37] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk you have to target only the fielset in the DIV
[04:50:50] <ShawnRisk> oh
[04:51:06] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk dunno if I well understand what you're trying to do :/
[04:51:17] <jomofcw> But this : "webform-component-share-the-friends--civicrm-custom-22" isn't a really standard ID...
[04:53:07] <walid> hi guys
[04:53:23] <walid> i've been trying to debug a script for hours now,
[04:53:34] <walid> and i finally found my mistake(i think)
[04:54:08] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw let me put in my real code
[04:54:09] <walid> i use a variable to filter something, and it seems before and after that variable comes a linebreak.
[04:54:25] <walid> (or so it is logged..)
[04:54:39] <walid> how can i avoid this, or where does this linebreak come from?
[04:55:00] <Kambfhase> huh?

[04:56:17] <walid>                 console.log('[data-section=' + section + ']');
[04:56:38] <walid> gives me: [data-section=

[04:59:22] <amijay> Hello
[04:59:32] <amijay> Where can I download a JQuery library from?
[05:00:29] <Kambfhase> amijay: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[05:01:12] <amijay> Thanks
[05:01:17] <Kambfhase> np
[05:02:45] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: here is the right code: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/4/ and there are three different sets of the fieldset in my wrapper.  If I click on the first accordion this should just close, but if I have the first open and click on second that should close the first one and open the second one.
[05:04:54] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk In that way you previous code was right
[05:05:10] <jomofcw> You just have to target the fieldset correctly as you do in this one
[05:06:19] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: how so?  I tried both ways and this one was working better than the previous one but not 100% correctly
[05:07:08] <walid> Kambfhase: that did it!
[05:07:09] <walid> thanks!!
[05:07:11] <bohl> How to send xml with jquery ajax? I do something like $.ajax({type:"post", data:"<foo><bar>data</bar></foo>"}) but this is not very elegant since the xml is a string
[05:07:15] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:08:02] <Cork> bohl: just create a xml document , build your elements with jquery
[05:08:13] <Cork> bohl: then use $(xml_doc).html()
[05:08:43] <bohl> hmm that looks legit, I'll give it a try
[05:08:57] <joon> hi, i really need help with this please : http://pastebin.com/4faZz2Py
[05:10:16] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: are you looking into this?
[05:15:50] <Cork> joon: it helps if you specify what you need help with
[05:16:24] <Cork> joon: that way ppl can see from your line if they are able to help you or not
[05:16:45] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk yea I'm now :)
[05:18:10] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk to be sure to understand what is the text of the first fieldset you want to "accordion" ?
[05:18:39] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: want to see live site?
[05:18:53] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk yea could be usefull, but in your example first ?
[05:19:42] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: this code or the earlier version?  The earlier version I don't have live
[05:19:59] <joon> Cork i found the trouble
[05:20:14] <joon> i was reloading the js in the ajax call
[05:20:26] <pallet> does anyone know a simple jquery calender?
[05:20:30] <pallet> popup
[05:20:31] <joon> so, my function was call as many time as i click to load...
[05:20:47] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk your first prob is $('fieldset .webform-component-fieldset>a').length return 0 : it doesn't match anything.
[05:20:54] <joon> i use "live" in the home call and that s ok
[05:21:29] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: if you go to notes to the friends that is the first one
[05:23:09] <RikudoSennin> hey guys, in the jquery ui there's the datepicker, is it possible to only enable certain dates for selection?
[05:23:33] <RikudoSennin> for instance, I want only the 5th, 7th and 13th, of the month to be enabled for selection, but disable every other date
[05:23:34] <Cork> RikudoSennin: you would have to extend it
[05:23:48] <RikudoSennin> how can I do that?
[05:23:55] <RikudoSennin> edit the original file? :o
[05:23:55] <Cork> RikudoSennin: but i know there exist extensions that for example let you pick ranges
[05:23:58] <hariom> I have a form that needs to be validated before submission, How should I submit if the validation is successful?
[05:24:01] <Cork> no
[05:24:19] <RikudoSennin> Cork: what I'm looking for is slightly more complex then ranges
[05:24:35] <RikudoSennin> the ultimate goal, is to only select Wednesdays and Mondays of the month
[05:24:43] <RikudoSennin> all the other days of the week should be disabled.
[05:24:47] <Cork> RikudoSennin: this is just an example http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/
[05:25:08] <Cork> RikudoSennin: you write a plugin that lives in its own file (if you like)
[05:25:21] <Cork> and that extends the core plugin
[05:25:23] <hariom> I guess it is via .submit()
[05:25:44] <Cork> hariom: exactly
[05:25:58] <Cork> hariom: if you don't want to trigger your event again
[05:26:07] <Cork> trigger it on the dom element instead of your jquery object
[05:26:16] <Cork> $('form')[0].submit();
[05:26:17] <hariom> ok
[05:26:24] <hariom> yea
[05:26:33] <Cork> then it won't trigger the event listner again
[05:26:34] <Sean-Der> Hello I am sorry for the stupid question, but what is the best way to work with PHP and jQuery? I would like to do a InsertAfter, but the content I am inserting is a foreach statement. I know this won't work with Javascript, but does jQuery have some sort of Ajax or other functions built in
[05:26:49] <RikudoSennin> Cork: I have no idea how to do that, do you have a tutorial on how to do it that could help me? (novice in jQuery, long time programmer)
[05:27:37] <Cork> RikudoSennin: http://www.google.com/search?q=extending+jquery+ui+datepicker
[05:28:19] <mbrevda> can anyone recommend a tree plugin (for displaying files/folders)? Must have the option for a checkbox next to each item

[05:29:49] <bot-t> Cork, #841 (Sortable (and Drag) performance enhancement) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/841
[05:29:55] <Cork> lol
[05:29:58] <aaairc> can you do .resize() on any element... or does it only work on $(window).resize()?
[05:30:25] <Cork> aaairc: it only works on window by default
[05:30:42] <Cork> aaairc: but some jquery ui fakes it
[05:31:11] <Cork> aaairc: for example $().dialog('widget').resize(function() {}); works
[05:31:13] <aaairc> so if i import jquery ui it .resize will work on any element
[05:31:31] <aaairc> ok
[05:32:14] <aaairc> i have a div that i animate the changing of the width... and i want to call a function incrementally while the width is changing... not sure the best way of doing that
[05:32:35] <sector119> Hello. Is there any plugin that would resize (make smaller + add scrollbars) some div if it doesn't fit in window, but when window makes bigger than div content need, div size becomes as its content?
[05:32:35] <Cork> aaairc: no not on any element
[05:32:38] <Sean-Der> http://api.jquery.com/load/ is this the best way to solve my problem?
[05:32:45] <Cork> aaairc: only on jquery ui objects that fake the event
[05:33:06] <Cork> aaairc: and dialog is one example of that
[05:33:16] <aaairc> maybe incrementaly isn't the right word. as the div changes its width over the course of a second... i want to call another function like 100 times to update the position of something else within that div as the div gets larger.
[05:33:30] <Itrace> Could somebody help me understand this? I want to get JSON from an API. There are two ways to do this. 1) through a script tag i.e. <script src="http://API.json">. Or 2) I could use something like the jQuery .getJSON method. What is the difference?

[06:14:17] <mtro> I am trying to append img title attributes to captions. I have multiple images, and my code puts all the attr's below each img. Where am I going wrong?
[06:14:20] <mtro> $('img').each( function () { var caption = $(this).attr('title'); $(this).after('<div class="caption"></div>'); $('.caption').append(caption); var caption = undefined; });
[06:15:23] <Kambfhase> lookin
[06:16:27] <Kambfhase> so you want to add a div with the class caption right below the corresponging image?
[06:16:52] <Kambfhase> amirite?
[06:16:58] <mtro> yes
[06:17:30] <mtro> and that is working fine. it's the the variable is adding everything it finds
[06:17:47] <mtro> meaning, the attr from all images, not just one at a time
[06:17:49] <blackspotwiggins> mtro, use the reference of the object you created
[06:17:59] <blackspotwiggins> instead of doing $(".caption")
[06:18:18] <mtro> can you explain what you mean?
[06:18:28] <blackspotwiggins> btw there is also <figcaption> which is a bit more semantic

[06:24:06] <Sean-Der> ?
[06:24:54] <Kambfhase> put a # infront of test
[06:25:00] <kborchers> Sean-Der: because that is not how you select something by name
[06:25:19] <z3yo> Kambfhase, no It's same thing that with myarray[1]
[06:25:35] <kborchers> if it is the name $("button[name='test']").click(function()...
[06:26:30] <Sean-Der> kborchers: That worked
[06:26:46] <Sean-Der> I am confused I remember doing it before and just calling it by its name
[06:26:56] <Sean-Der> "button[name='test']" never done that before
[06:27:19] <nevvermind1> yellow. if i attach a method to the "onClick" event of a link, how can i refer to that link in my method?

[06:30:19] <z3yo> I have an array of <a> elements, how can I acces to one of them ?
[06:30:50] <nevvermind1> ok, cool. but how can i make that.. erm... this, a "jQuery this"?

[06:37:42] <blackspotwiggins> z3yo, dude
[06:37:49] <z3yo> So I dunno why only array are returned
[06:37:50] <blackspotwiggins> learn wtf you are accessing before blaming
[06:37:51] <aaronmcadam> try using firebug's breakpoints too z3yo
[06:38:00] <blackspotwiggins> it's a plain dom object
[06:38:06] <blackspotwiggins> ofc it wont have jquery methods
[06:38:23] <z3yo> blackspotwiggins, I can access my elements with each()
[06:38:24] <z3yo> only
[06:38:41] <aaronmcadam> wrap array[0] with jQuery()
[06:38:49] <aaronmcadam> that will allow you access to its methods
[06:39:05] <blackspotwiggins> srsly
[06:39:07] <aaronmcadam> so $(array[0]).text()
[06:39:13] <blackspotwiggins> stop to read what i said
[06:40:15] <Sean-Der> Is there a function to clear everything inside of a <div>?

[06:44:42] <aaronmcadam> yes but please try to listen to guys in here
[06:44:46] <aaronmcadam> it's very frustrating for us
[06:45:18] <Sean-Der> Is it better to use event delegation or rebinding. I am trying to make buttons works that are called in .php scripts with .load()
[06:45:30] <muzone> Anybody know of buttons similar to / better than http://www.net-a-porter.com/nap/build/2011.08.02/images/purchase_path/proceed_to_purchase.gif ?
[06:45:30] <blackspotwiggins> Sean-Der, depends on the amount of events
[06:45:32] <aaronmcadam> $.delegate dude Sean-Der
[06:45:39] <pallet> right someone help me please, I need a simply dialog to popup on a textfield change, that has "option 1", "Option 2" and "option 3" but I can't find one
[06:45:43] <blackspotwiggins> i think delegation is usually better choice
[06:45:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:45:51] <pallet> anyone please help
[06:45:57] <aaronmcadam> it's also very useful for delegating to groups of elements
[06:46:29] <aaronmcadam> e.g. a group of divs with buttons you want to attach a click handler to
[06:46:47] <Sean-Der> Ok I am going to read jQuerys API on delegation hopefully I can get it
[06:46:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's handy
[06:47:17] <aaronmcadam> one gotcha Sean-Der is to make sure the context you pass is not replaced by your ajax callback
[06:47:23] <blackspotwiggins> muzone, yeah i know better buttons
[06:47:28] <blackspotwiggins> WITH XBOX HUGE TEXT
[06:47:39] <pallet> anyone ?
[06:48:05] <aaronmcadam> have you tried ui dialog yet?
[06:48:18] <izepstan> someone maybe a hint: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448803/
[06:48:21] <blackspotwiggins> pallet, if you expect us to do your work, you are mistaken
[06:48:31] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins++
[06:48:53] <pallet> I was just asking if anyone knew one, not for anyone to do my work
[06:48:58] <aaronmcadam> this article should be read by everyone in here
[06:48:58] <aaronmcadam> http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[06:50:08] <kostodo> is there a simple way to use PHP and JS to display the current HH:MM time and have it updating on the screen?
[06:50:33] <aaronmcadam> kostodo, you can do that with js alone you know
[06:51:00] <kostodo> aaronmcadam: how?
[06:51:10] <blackspotwiggins> kostodo, think how the updating would work
[06:51:35] <aaronmcadam> ?date @ kostodo
[06:51:37] <bot-t> kostodo, Plugins/Validation/Methods/date - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/date
[06:51:40] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn date
[06:51:43] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Wednesday, 2011-07-13 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110713.log.html
[06:51:47] <blackspotwiggins> ?mdc date @ kostodo
[06:51:48] <aaronmcadam> ah cock
[06:51:48] <bot-t> kostodo, Date - MDN Docs - Creates Date instances which let you work with dates and times. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[06:51:49] <og01> aaronmcadam: ah but does he want the server time? or the clients time?
[06:51:55] <aaronmcadam> cheers blackspotwiggins  lol
[06:52:10] <kostodo> I need the server time
[06:52:15] <nevvermind1> yeah, about that "this" :P. http://jsfiddle.net/sebE3/2/ am i missing something?
[06:52:18] <aaronmcadam> true, IIRC date() uses the client's system time
[06:52:21] <kostodo> actually no
[06:52:22] <Adman65> is there some plugin that will allow me to easily lightbox a div? I have pre rendered divs, when a click event happens I want to lightbox one
[06:52:25] <kostodo> I need to set custom time according to a timezone
[06:52:29] <kostodo> GMT+4
[06:52:47] <aaronmcadam> why don't you use an api?
[06:53:03] <blackspotwiggins> kostodo, you can adjust the time to whatever timezone you want
[06:53:04] <kostodo> I  just wanted a simple method
[06:53:06] <aaronmcadam> or you could just increment a Date object
[06:53:26] <blackspotwiggins> again simple != us doing it for you
[06:53:27] <og01> you can ofset the clients or your server's time, but you cant rely on the client's clock
[06:53:32] <Sean-Der> So from delegate what it looks like is you create a custome function and then call it with a button? I am confused links anyone?
[06:53:38] <aaronmcadam> woo dude you're on fire
[06:53:39] <blackspotwiggins> do some research on js date object
[06:57:06] <Jon47> Sean-Der, you're describing event handlers, delegate is an advanced method of binding on top of that
[06:57:33] <Sqerry> oh my god is this the holy jQuery
[06:57:38] <aaronmcadam> Sean-Der, did you actually read the API doc?
[06:57:50] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ Sean-Der
[06:57:51] <bot-t> Sean-Der, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:58:07] <Kambfhase> w000t 5300 JS errors and still rising

[07:09:34] <Sqerry> common i need a head start
[07:09:37] <jomofcw> Sqerry if you're not trolling, really you have to first learn web dev, then go to jQuery doc. We could help you only after that
[07:09:44] <Kambfhase> $('head').start()
[07:09:51] <Sqerry> but i need live support

[07:10:42] <jomofcw> OMG... VB6... you know that's not a real program :D ,
[07:10:49] <blackspotwiggins> by going to #c++ and pestering people?
[07:10:55] <Sean-Der> Sqerry: Whats your salary?
[07:10:55] <jomofcw> and so if you know what is javascript, you know what is jQ

[07:11:17] <blackspotwiggins> ok sure
[07:11:34] <Sqerry> lol
[07:11:35] <jomofcw> Anyway : learn web dev, read jQ doc.
[07:11:54] <Sean-Der> Sqerry: I am 18 you fuck and I am payed to write PHP + MySQL, no one cares what you pretend to know. Until you do some good OSS work or decent private work
[07:11:57] <dr0id> possible to just change the URL in the address bar ? but not really go to that URL ?
[07:12:14] <blackspotwiggins> dr0id, in a limited way
[07:12:16] <blackspotwiggins> pathname part
[07:12:33] <dr0id> like, example.com/home to example.com/about
[07:12:34] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise it would be a pretty big security hole
[07:12:51] <Sqerry> Sean-der this is the first time im working on JS
[07:12:53] <blackspotwiggins> dr0id, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.history
[07:12:57] <blackspotwiggins> check pushState
[07:13:58] <Sean-Der> Sqerry: Don't act like your some big dog, I am new to JS too, but I bet the guys helping out are heads above us both.
[07:14:02] <og01> Sqerry: Go read a book perhaps? follow some tutorials? and god damn it i swear your just trolling or just very very stupid
[07:14:03] <Sean-Der> Thats all I am saying
[07:14:26] <Sqerry> Sean-Der dude, this is the first time i'm touching JS
[07:14:41] <Sqerry> lol anyway
[07:14:44] <jomofcw> Sqerry touch yourself instead, that should be better :D
[07:14:45] <blackspotwiggins> Sqerry, you have an incredible sense of entitlement
[07:14:46] <Sqerry> im not even a web developer
[07:14:52] <Sqerry> ROFL
[07:14:56] <aaronmcadam> Sqerry, you need to learn JavaScript basics first
[07:14:58] <silverd> afternoon guys, is there a way to pickup the x & y co-ords of a mouse click within an item in an image map (e.g. with a poly)
[07:15:05] <Sqerry> yeah where from

[07:15:38] <Sean-Der> Sqerry: Check out HTML and CSS first
[07:15:40] <aaronmcadam> you're not gonna get basic building blocks of how you do web dev Sqerry
[07:15:42] <blackspotwiggins> Sqerry, no you dont
[07:15:48] <blackspotwiggins> make an effort yourself
[07:15:51] <jomofcw> ... Sqerry are you blind seriously ?
[07:15:54] <blackspotwiggins> noone likes freeloaders
[07:16:06] <silverd> Kambfhase, isn't that relative the page, not the specific object area?
[07:16:13] <aaronmcadam> i'd hate to employ someone like you
[07:16:16] <aaronmcadam> or work with!
[07:16:20] <Cvelde> Sqerry: buy some books, read the documentation - work through tutorials
[07:16:21] <jomofcw> Sqerry http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[07:16:25] <Cvelde> thats how we roll

[07:16:40] <aaronmcadam> video tutorials are good too, look on lynda.com
[07:16:52] <blackspotwiggins> silverd, you can use elements offset() to calculate position
[07:17:01] <Sqerry> Im not intended to work with Jquery i need to finish this project that i am about to start
[07:17:07] <Sqerry> its not complicated.
[07:17:08] <blackEyEz> if i have a list with 5 items, how can i easy use JQ to let them fadeIn one by one?
[07:17:09] <blackspotwiggins> maybe there is a easier way as well, but im not really familiar with image maps
[07:17:16] <Sqerry> I just need help with jQuery
[07:17:21] <silverd> cheers Kambfhase and blackspotwiggins :) to the bat cave.......
[07:17:30] <Kambfhase> Fuck i am at 500 lines and already i have no idea what my code is doing. srsly jQ tends to creaty spaghetti code
[07:17:36] <og01> Sqerry: http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[07:17:55] <blackspotwiggins> Sqerry, you are srsly trolling or the most arrogant and stupid noob ive seen

[07:18:19] <Sqerry> what
[07:18:21] <Cvelde> Sqerry: if you have a problem, or got some code that isnt working we might help, but nobody is going to write code for you
[07:18:24] <seutje> hehe, u said "noob" :')
[07:18:25] <aaronmcadam> ahh didn't know you could do that!
[07:18:30] <pallet> Have I got my syntax wrong here ?         jQuery("folldate").onChange( function(event){
[07:18:35] <Sqerry> I never asked anyone to write a code for me
[07:18:44] <Kambfhase> pallet: no `on`
[07:18:49] <Kambfhase> just .change
[07:18:59] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: better be sure and make it a server-side ignore :P
[07:19:04] <jomofcw> Sqerry http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[07:19:05] <Sean-Der> Sqerry: Go to w3schools and learn!
[07:19:06] <jomofcw> Sqerry http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[07:19:07] <Sqerry> I just don't get the mentality of JQuery
[07:19:09] <jomofcw> Sqerry http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[07:19:16] <seutje> noooes, don't go to w3schools plz
[07:19:21] <jomofcw> [perhaps he will see if I flood xD]
[07:19:22] <Cvelde> jomofcw: stop spamming please
[07:19:35] <jomofcw> Cvelde not really spam, just flood
[07:19:48] <Sean-Der> Everyone just ignore him its pointless he is just trolling
[07:19:53] <jomofcw> OK
[07:20:00] <jomofcw> Done
[07:20:01] <Kambfhase> think of jquery as sets and of the methods as { elements}^n -> { elements }^m
[07:20:03] <Sqerry> someone briefly explain what jQuery is and how it works please.
[07:20:08] <seutje> when's http://learn.jquery.com gonna launch?
[07:20:12] <Kambfhase> its pure magic!
[07:20:29] <jomofcw> seutje you should write it :p
[07:20:31] <og01> Sqerry:
[07:20:32] <seutje> Sqerry: it's a javascript library to make traversing and animating easier and more consistent
[07:20:37] <Cvelde> Sqerry: jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML  document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions  for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.
[07:20:40] <seutje> jomofcw: what do u mean, write it?
[07:20:58] <og01> heh well i failed to paste
[07:21:00] <jomofcw> the learn section of jsQuery
[07:21:03] <jomofcw> jQuery
[07:21:15] <Sqerry> hmm i see
[07:21:15] <jomofcw> Could be well :P !
[07:21:19] <blackspotwiggins> wasnt there jquery fundamentals book?
[07:21:21] <Sqerry> is tehre a way i can get some sort of hintlist
[07:21:22] <Sqerry> ?
[07:21:22] <seutje> jomofcw: https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com
[07:21:46] <jomofcw> OMG it exists
[07:21:52] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[07:21:55] <Cvelde> seutje: we should make sure to watch out for him in the drupal channels :D
[07:21:56] <blackspotwiggins> yeah that one
[07:22:10] <seutje> Cvelde: good thing I stopped looking at most drupal channels :D
[07:22:16] <phlp> http://jqfundamentals.com/book
[07:22:29] <Kambfhase> FFFUUUCCCKKK not to self: when quoting object keys, dont quote the colon
[07:22:32] <Kambfhase> FUCK!
[07:22:44] <Know1edge> Odd question, but does anyone know of a script that will allow you to draw boxes on an 960 grid and save the structure out? Thinking of adding a layout builder
[07:22:54] <aaronmcadam> haha Kambfhase
[07:23:03] <seutje> Know1edge: heh, I'm actually building that right now
[07:23:03] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:23:11] <aaronmcadam> does masonry have that Know1edge
[07:23:13] <Know1edge> seutje: oh yeah?
[07:23:21] <seutje> still struggling with how to save it though
[07:23:29] <seutje> like what should be wrapped to make the floats work
[07:23:31] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: masjonry is great, but it does not really have what im talking about
[07:23:40] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, positioned floats
[07:23:41] <Sqerry> Is it possible to handle a login session purely with jQuery?
[07:23:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah just a quick idea
[07:23:43] <seutje> aaronmcadam: masonry screws with the order
[07:23:48] <blackspotwiggins> ie10 seems hot in that area
[07:23:53] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:23:55] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: WAT?
[07:24:07] <seutje> this needs to work on pretty much everything btw
[07:24:15] <blackspotwiggins> yeah true
[07:24:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:24:24] <aaronmcadam> was gonna ask seutje
[07:24:25] <blackspotwiggins> but ie10 has some advanced shit
[07:24:33] <Sqerry> ok ignore me.
[07:24:36] <seutje> just needs to spit out a regular floated layout
[07:24:40] <aaronmcadam> no prob Sqerry
[07:24:49] <seutje> Sqerry: clientside?
[07:24:51] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:25:02] <Know1edge> seutje:  my idea was to use 960.gs
[07:25:02] <aaronmcadam> you got a repo up at all seutje ?
[07:25:03] <Sqerry> serverside
[07:25:10] <seutje> Sqerry: why not just post ur DB details on the page? :P
[07:25:11] <Know1edge> and just use standard classes with the grid system to handle the floats
[07:25:12] <seutje> oh
[07:25:18] <Know1edge> then just send up an array of the dom elements to server side
[07:25:18] <Sqerry> lol
[07:25:26] <seutje> aaronmcadam: it's for work, so I'm not allowed to release anything just yet
[07:25:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah i thought u might have been trying to do it outside of the code :)
[07:26:19] <seutje> Sqerry: considering jquery was designed for dom traversal, animations and ajax (none of which u use on the server side), I doubt u'll be able to use jQuery all that much
[07:26:21] <Sqerry> you said earlier, you can do animating how is that possible?
[07:26:28] <seutje> ?animate
[07:26:29] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:27:20] <seutje> Know1edge: you need proper wrappers or it's never gonna work
[07:27:23] <Sqerry> is that for like buttons?
[07:27:29] <Kambfhase> w00t, it breathes!
[07:27:37] <seutje> Know1edge: imagine this: 1 block in left columns, 2 in right
[07:27:41] <jomofcw> He already ask thing ?
[07:27:46] <Cvelde> Sqerry: really, stop it
[07:27:50] <jomofcw> He ask again ?
[07:27:54] <Sqerry> stop what
[07:28:01] <aaronmcadam> i'm gonna block him i think
[07:28:04] <seutje> Know1edge: when normally floated, the 2nd block in the right column will appear below the 1st block in the left column
[07:28:09] <jomofcw> Already done for me :D
[07:28:17] <seutje> Know1edge: in this case, I'd need to wrap those 2 blocks in the right column
[07:28:18] <Know1edge> seutje: that's why you have container wrappers
[07:28:24] <jomofcw> And then we could help guys who really need to
[07:28:27] <seutje> yea, that's what I need to determine
[07:28:30] <seutje> where to put wrappers
[07:28:38] <Aric_> I want to cycle through all of className and use the id to load a dynamic snippet of code, but i also want it to refresh that every X amount of seconds (used for widgets) ... is this even remotely what i want -> http://www.pastie.org/private/ocngborhwqlqv5kihudng
[07:28:42] <Know1edge> ie container_4 inside a grid_4, which removes the margin/padding
[07:28:50] <Know1edge> then put in grid_2, grid_2 inside of the container_4
[07:29:02] <aaronmcadam> anyone on ubuntu/linux?
[07:29:06] <seutje> no shit, now gimme an algorythm that detects that
[07:29:16] <aaronmcadam> lollll
[07:29:22] <Sqerry> can't even guide a beginner, what a waste of time. hopeless.
[07:29:27] <seutje> BYE
[07:29:29] <aaronmcadam> gtfo out
[07:29:36] <aaronmcadam> goood
[07:29:43] <seutje> can't even read a fucking manual, what a waste of space
[07:29:43] <jomofcw> God bless us !
[07:29:43] <Know1edge> seutje:  I'll work something out, gonna be online for a while?
[07:30:00] <seutje> Know1edge: actually, no, friday and almost party time :D
[07:30:08] <aaronmcadam> good luck Knowledge
[07:30:09] <Know1edge> its only 9am here ?:
[07:30:12] <Know1edge> :P
[07:30:18] <aaronmcadam> it's 3:30pm here
[07:30:20] <Know1edge> well almost 10 hah
[07:30:24] <Know1edge> Where are you guys?
[07:30:30] <aaronmcadam> i'm in england, from ireland
[07:30:34] <jomofcw> 16:30 pm here, and soon week end
[07:30:45] <jomofcw> 4:30 pm xD
[07:30:49] <og01> oh crap it is 3.30pm, need to work more
[07:30:51] <Know1edge> Ah, greetings to the future! :P
[07:30:54] <jomofcw> Just can't work with those PM AM
[07:30:55] <Haprog> 5.30pm
[07:30:55] <_aj_> hi all, i'm trying to figure out how to style two different jquery-ui autocomplete ul's on the same page differently.  it looks like the widget creates an orphaned UL element, so differentiate the two created to access and style differently
[07:31:19] <jomofcw> Haprog spanish ? or in the south ?
[07:31:24] <Haprog> jomofcw: Finland
[07:31:26] <Know1edge> _aj_: put the widgets in their own container with a unique id
[07:31:30] <juha___> lol finnfag
[07:31:39] <jomofcw> Haprog oh yea right I turn it in the wrong way xD
[07:31:41] <Know1edge> then style #yourId1 .ui_element_class_here
[07:31:42] <Haprog> juha___: trollol
[07:31:52] <aaronmcadam> loil
[07:31:54] <_aj_> the autocomplete widget creates an orphaned ul
[07:31:57] <aaronmcadam> finnfag? hjahaha
[07:32:07] <Aric_> Know1edge: http://www.pastie.org/private/ocngborhwqlqv5kihudng -> will that work to load content based on an id name in the markup and also reload it every x seconds continuously?
[07:32:08] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: I'm in Nashville, TN US
[07:32:14] <aaronmcadam> cool dude
[07:32:15] <blackspotwiggins> 5:30 represent
[07:32:22] <aaronmcadam> well I'll be on for a while
[07:32:23] <blackspotwiggins> oh sqerry left
[07:32:23] <Aric_> aaronmcadam: I'm in Washington, DC US
[07:32:23] <blackspotwiggins> nice
[07:32:34] <Haprog> yup
[07:32:35] <_aj_> it creates a ul just appended to the dom, not within any element you specify or nest it in as far as i can tell
[07:32:36] <aaronmcadam> hit me when you make any progress Know1edge
[07:32:40] <zhudock> does prevUntil() support attribute selectors, specifically the rowIndex attr?      $(this).prevUntil("tr[rowIndex=3]")  does not seem to work, instead it gets the same output as $(this).prevAll()
[07:32:40] <jomofcw> blackspotwiggins yea god exists :)
[07:32:41] <juha___> it's 32pm here, i've just taken some lsd and i'm waaayy out there
[07:32:42] <Know1edge> will do
[07:32:57] <aaronmcadam> might be able to help, interesting idea
[07:33:02] <Know1edge> ive got a bit of an idea of how i can get it to work, will be ugly as sin, but sure i can get help to clean it up and be extendable
[07:33:12] <aaronmcadam> yeag
[07:33:27] <aaronmcadam> whack it up on github if u can clean out any project specific stuff
[07:34:01] <Know1edge> sure thing
[07:34:11] <Taftse|Work> hey bobdobbs
[07:34:22] <bobdobbs> Taftse|Work: ;)
[07:36:15] <Sean-Der> since I am using .load() is it going to be difficult to do form validation if I am pulling about 5 php scripts?
[07:36:27] <Sean-Der> Just planning ahead
[07:36:51] <_aj_> if there was a way to get a reference to the created ul in any of the events
[07:36:58] <_aj_> but doesn't look like there is
[07:38:19] <z3yo> Is there an event to know if a user has typed something in an input text ? Another event than keyup or keydown ...
[07:38:26] <pallet> don't flame me cos I'm still learning, but I want to simple fire an alert when a form editbox changes...
[07:38:26] <pallet>         jQuery("company_num").change( function(event){
[07:38:27] <pallet>            alert('');
[07:38:27] <pallet>         });
[07:38:42] <pallet> why is that not working?
[07:38:52] <Woet> pallet: what is 'company_num'?
[07:38:52] <blackspotwiggins> you are selecting the element company_num
[07:38:56] <Woet> if it's an ID, use #company_num
[07:38:58] <blackspotwiggins> which prolly doesnt exist
[07:39:00] <Woet> if it's a class, use .company_num
[07:39:02] <Woet> just like css :)
[07:39:16] <aaronmcadam> guys
[07:39:27] <aaronmcadam> can we create like an advanced #jquery?
[07:39:32] <_aj_> yes, there is an event, but it's not the input i want, it's the list that autocomplete renders
[07:39:41] <aaronmcadam> so we can talk about fixing our problems instead of fixing others
[07:39:43] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:39:45] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, what do you think would happen?
[07:40:09] <aaronmcadam> hmm i dunno, but seriously it'd be good to talk about more advanced topics than "use an id in your selector"
[07:40:10] <blackspotwiggins> "im a programmer for 10 years how do i jquery" guys would just come there
[07:40:13] <Woet> yes, aaronmcadam, we've obviously never been new at jquery ourselves
[07:40:18] <blackspotwiggins> everyone thinks they are awesome
[07:40:21] <Woet> fuck helping them, they ain't worth our time
[07:40:29] <aaronmcadam> oh no, I've been helping out for nearly 2 years dude
[07:40:30] <Kambfhase> #advancedandnoobfreejquery
[07:40:33] <blackspotwiggins> and people who actually are would lose their last incentive to be here
[07:40:40] <aaronmcadam> don't get me wrong guys
[07:41:03] <aaronmcadam> I'd keep this one open, it'd just be cool to talk about design patterns, deployment, etc etc etc
[07:41:08] <_aj_> i'm suggesting a feature to jquery-ui autocomplete widget
[07:41:11] <blackspotwiggins> yeah it'd be cool
[07:41:16] <Woet> what prevents you from talking about it here aaronmcadam?
[07:41:22] <Woet> i've seen rather advanced talk in here
[07:41:23] <aaronmcadam> i'm NOT saying to stop helping
[07:41:25] <blackspotwiggins> i've given up on asking for advice here tbh
[07:41:36] <aaronmcadam> exactly my issue blackspotwiggins
[07:42:21] <aaronmcadam> I'd love to set up a site for code reviews
[07:42:32] <aaronmcadam> I'd like to talk about refactoring too
[07:42:44] <aaronmcadam> now that would get lost amongst most guys in here lookin for help
[07:43:06] <aaronmcadam> and would probably alienate those beginners too
[07:43:09] <bobdobbs> I
[07:43:22] <bobdobbs> I'd suggest keeping that discussion in this channel
[07:43:33] <aaronmcadam> fair enough, just a thought
[07:43:45] <aaronmcadam> I really want a code review site though
[07:44:05] <aaronmcadam> *could* maybe have a section on github, that'd be ideal
[07:44:06] <bobdobbs> guys like me, who are intermediate, and not advanced programmers, will be pulled up a level by just being bystanders in advanced conversations
[07:44:29] <bobdobbs> we need to be exposed to advanced subjects.
[07:44:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm not saying I'm way advanced either, I take ur point fully
[07:45:04] <aaronmcadam> I wanna write an ant script to build my backbone views into one file for deployment
[07:45:28] <aaronmcadam> require/lab don't seem to play well with jquery-mobile
[07:45:33] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, like h5bp script?
[07:45:40] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[07:45:48] <Woet> vo
[07:45:49] <blackspotwiggins> html5 boilerplate has a buildscript
[07:45:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:45:58] <aaronmcadam> I was gonna look at that
[07:46:10] <aaronmcadam> but I might use inotify to call it
[07:46:54] <aaronmcadam> so I could put a call on my dev server to build the files when I run my update repo script
[07:47:28] <aaronmcadam> inotify is a linux process for subscribing to file change events
[07:47:40] <aaronmcadam> ubuntu notifications uses it
[07:47:44] <kborchers> _aj_: if you need a reference to the UL created by autocomplete, just use $(".ui-menu")
[07:47:58] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, for dev work it's prolly ok
[07:48:06] <aaronmcadam> aye I know
[07:48:10] <blackspotwiggins> but for production precompiling would be better
[07:48:16] <aaronmcadam> but I'd like to experiment before production
[07:48:37] <aaronmcadam> the company i'm at don't do any build process currently
[07:48:47] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[07:48:56] <aaronmcadam> i'm not used to it myself, but need to learn, got 17 scripts in my app
[07:49:29] <aaronmcadam> they only come to 97.3 k, it's pipelining and requests i wanna use
[07:49:41] <aaronmcadam> gonna use rackspace cdn, cdnjs as well
[07:50:04] <aaronmcadam> switchin to cdnjs from google made a big difference in request time
[07:50:06] <pallet> Woet, the .change event only fires once I've tabbed out of a the form field I'm changing, I need it to fire while I'm still in it?
[07:50:15] <aaronmcadam> cut 200ms off overall
[07:50:50] <Sean-Der> function(){  $("#phone1").empty(); }); What is the best way to .empty() Multiple divs?
[07:51:37] <Woet> pallet: .keyup
[07:52:10] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, cdnjs looks pretty interesting
[07:52:13] <pallet> ok, thanks
[07:52:33] <aaronmcadam> it's great dude
[07:52:42] <aaronmcadam> cloudflare is awesome
[07:53:05] <aaronmcadam> rackspace cdn uses the same ideas, using the closest possible IP mirror
[07:53:25] <blackspotwiggins> im prolly moving my static stuff on s3/cloudfront
[07:53:34] <blackspotwiggins> packaging everything together
[07:53:43] <blackspotwiggins> instead of having app code + libs separately
[07:53:51] <aaronmcadam> yes then you lose the point of cdn tho
[07:53:54] <aaronmcadam> but it's nice to have
[07:54:00] <blackspotwiggins> cloudfront is a cdn :D
[07:54:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah but i mean the likelihood somebody will already have it in their cache
[07:54:34] <aaronmcadam> but on the other hand, the client will have it if expires headers are set really long
[07:54:53] <blackspotwiggins> well then the question is
[07:55:12] <aaronmcadam> it's request over caching really
[07:55:18] <blackspotwiggins> if cdnjs/other cdn cache hit + app code miss is better than all of my app js hit/miss
[07:55:23] <aaronmcadam> number of requests vs caching i mean
[07:55:25] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/0RtAmiUn is this not nested correctly?
[07:55:47] <aaronmcadam> you can always use fallbacks anyway
[07:56:05] <blackspotwiggins> Sean-Der, the last {} is extraneous
[07:56:09] <aaronmcadam> was trying to do something like that with yepnope
[07:56:31] <aaronmcadam> but couldn't get it to work right with jqmobile
[07:56:56] <aaronmcadam> the wait() method of labjs wasn't working right for it either
[07:57:11] <eeP> ok im back
[07:58:59] <eeP> I've got an idea of what jQuery is how can i find the event/function to close the window if the specific class or id exists??
[07:59:28] <eeP> what would be the close window function name
[08:00:42] <eeP> ?
[08:03:19] <dabear> eeP: in general you cannot close tabs or windows. windows that are opened through js can be closed though. var win = window.open(""); win.close()
[08:03:23] <aaronmcadam> not sure the spec covers that
[08:03:30] <dabear> this is not related to jquery though
[08:03:39] <eeP> exactly
[08:03:41] <eeP> yeah
[08:03:46] <eeP> look this is the code i got
[08:03:51] <aaronmcadam> does that not trigger popup blocking
[08:03:54] <dabear> ?paste @ eeP
[08:03:54] <bot-t> eeP, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:04:13] <josefig> how would be a good idea to create a tab (jqueryui tab widget) with a parameter? I mean, I need a tab with all my elements and the next one with all my friends' elements..
[08:04:34] <ShawnRisk> jomofcw: hi
[08:08:29] <eeP> http://fixee.org/paste/1t24kk6/
[08:10:20] <ahaller> Hi. Is there a way to resolve a $.Deferred() Object multiple times and call all it's promise's handlers?
[08:12:10] <eeP> ??
[08:13:34] <eeP> dabear have you checked the link?
[08:14:00] <dabear> i am gaming
[08:14:06] <Jon47> i don't know if you can resolve it multiple times.. but you certainly may attach multiple methods as callbacks for the success promise.. i haven't used it much though, just with ajax
[08:14:13] <ahaller> Here's a short example of what i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/THvY7/1/
[08:14:56] <dabear> eeP: DO NOT use a string as first parameter to setInterval
[08:14:58] <dabear> use a function
[08:15:43] <dabear> eeP: assume var awindow = window.open(...)
[08:15:51] <dabear> then you can do awindow.close()
[08:15:56] <dabear> please try your self
[08:16:00] <eeP> ok thanks
[08:16:02] <dabear> I am not providing the complete solution
[08:16:07] <eeP> kk
[08:17:01] <ShawnRisk> This is the code I have http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/16/ for an accordion but this is not working on my site as the arrows stays down meaning open sometimes.  Also sometimes there is an overlay of the accordions.  site: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/contact-us
[08:17:12] <ahaller> The think i like about promises is that you can attach handlers after an event has been triggered. But maybe it is not supposed to work that way.
[08:27:19] <RikudoSennin> how can I select an element who's id equals to the "for" attribute of the clicked element?
[08:27:28] <izepstan> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448803/ does someone have experience with elRTE
[08:29:28] <aaronmcadam> RikudoSennin, try this $( label ).click( function () { $( '#' + $(this).attr('for')  ).dosomething(); });
[08:29:49] <RikudoSennin> aaronmcadam: thanks
[08:29:58] <aaronmcadam> *should* work
[08:30:44] <rns> anyone ever seen jquery used to hide/show forms in a formset based on a choice in a dropdown menu?
[08:31:11] <RikudoSennin> rns: yes
[08:31:22] <rns> RikudoSennin, where?
[08:31:23] <RikudoSennin> in fact I'm working on this exact thing right now
[08:31:34] <RikudoSennin> what do you need?
[08:32:19] <RikudoSennin> PHP generates the forms, jQuery grabs it with AJAX and then shows the appropriate forms based on the selection of a <select> element
[08:32:19] <rns> RikudoSennin, well I am thinking about implementing this in a project I am working on and was trying to find other sites that did this
[08:33:03] <RikudoSennin> well, my application is fully dynamic, for instance, you select a month, and you get a specific calendar for that month
[08:33:08] <rns> RikudoSennin, that's pretty much exactly what I am thinking about doing.  Users can dynamically add forms to the formset and I'd like to hide all but one instead of listing them all out on the same page
[08:33:46] <rns> RikudoSennin, do you know of any live examples where I can see this in action?
[08:33:50] <RikudoSennin> I start with no forms on the page, and if the user changes the <select>, all the current forms are discarded, and new ones take their place
[08:33:57] <bbyte> hi
[08:34:04] <bbyte> do tabs not play well with ajax?
[08:34:18] <RikudoSennin> rns: sorry, no :P I've been using it myself, but I haven't seen anyone else doing so
[08:34:25] <bbyte> i've got a tab that refreshes data every 3s with an ajax request
[08:34:27] <RikudoSennin> bbyte: see .live and .delegate
[08:34:29] <blackspotwiggins> bbyte, ajax totally owns tabs in every game
[08:34:37] <blackspotwiggins> no contest
[08:34:52] <rns> RikudoSennin, okay well I might ping you later if I decide to go this route
[08:34:58] <rns> glad to hear someone else is working on it too
[08:35:00] <RikudoSennin> sure thing
[08:35:38] <aaronmcadam> RikudoSennin, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/vtune/
[08:35:57] <bbyte> same still
[08:35:58] <RikudoSennin> aaronmcadam: awesome, thanks :D
[08:36:07] <bbyte> very strange :(
[08:36:28] <aaronmcadam> I've shown you that you can use .next() to select an input if that's what u wanted
[08:36:29] <RikudoSennin> bbyte: what is?
[08:36:35] <bbyte> .live shouldn't matter anyway, since the function loads
[08:36:39] <bbyte> just the ajax call in it doesn't
[08:37:01] <RikudoSennin> aaronmcadam: the point is to not depend on the location of the input :)
[08:37:45] <RikudoSennin> bbyte: use your browser's network sensor to see whether the request is sent, maybe you are getting a 404, maybe you mispelled the page name, I dunno, there could be many things
[08:37:46] <aaronmcadam> though you shouldn't prevent the default action of clicking a label because if the for attr of a label matches that of an id of an input, the browser selects the input when u click it for accessiblity reasons
[08:37:48] <RikudoSennin> you'll have to be a bit more specific :)
[08:38:01] <RikudoSennin> aaronmcadam: yeah, I didn't
[08:38:10] <bbyte> it's not getting sent
[08:38:13] <RikudoSennin> in fact, I think I managed to do without it :D
[08:38:13] <ShawnRisk> This is the code I have http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/16/Â for an accordion but this is not working on my site as the arrows stays down meaning open sometimes. Â Also sometimes there is an overlay of the accordions. Â site: http://friendsofglendon.ca/sites/FoG/contact-us
[08:38:20] <bbyte> just the ajax requests of the tabs are sent
[08:38:39] <aaronmcadam> good man RikudoSennin, just always best to not kill accessibility :)
[08:39:06] <eeP> dabear i've got rid of "window.open(prefix + number + suffix, '_blank')" and instead made an array, and replaced that with the array, though when i open it, it automatically opens up the page and doesn't continue further.
[08:39:18] <RikudoSennin> bbyte: code?
[08:39:24] <dabear> eeP: did not compute
[08:39:28] <dabear> whaaa?
[08:40:25] <eeP> xD dw about it don't think i got it right
[08:40:37] <blackspotwiggins> eksdee
[08:40:45] <mister> Hi
[08:40:47] <fabiobik> hi ppl, can please test this page if works? http://gatinhamolhadinha.pt.vu/
[08:40:48] <bbyte> https://pastee.org/4bph
[08:40:52] <eeP> though my friend said "if you want to keep track of all of them, to be able to close you would need to store it in an arary or list of some sort"
[08:40:52] <bbyte> password is "k"
[08:41:04] <misterm> fabiobik: test it for what
[08:41:18] <fabiobik> here gives me an error
[08:41:38] <mister> is it possible to change the orders elements are listed using jquery? Let's I have a php loop that prints 5 list items and I don't have the way to put them in order via php. Could this be done by using jquery?
[08:41:44] <mister> *order
[08:42:09] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me
[08:42:11] <misterm> fabiobik: what kind of error?
[08:42:19] <eeP> dabear
[08:42:21] <fabiobik> 404
[08:42:48] <RikudoSennin> aaronmcadam: actually, accessibility is not a concern actually, I'm limiting the browser support to Chrome only. Also, my audience does not require any special rules or JS compatible stuff :D
[08:43:06] <bbyte> chrome ftw <3
[08:43:19] * RikudoSennin seconds bbyte notion.
[08:43:35] <dabear> mister: you can sort elements in jquery, yes
[08:44:01] <RikudoSennin> misterm: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[08:44:03] <eeP> dabear also can i force open on tab when i say "window.open" ?
[08:44:15] <dabear> eeP: no, you cannot
[08:44:22] <bbyte> dunno if you saw my pastee through the mess, RikudoSennin :p
[08:44:27] <bbyte> [17:40:47] <bbyte> https://pastee.org/4bph
[08:44:27] <bbyte> [17:40:51] <bbyte> password is "k"
[08:44:29] <bbyte> here you go again
[08:44:52] <mister> RikudoSennin: thanks!
[08:44:58] <RikudoSennin> np
[08:45:13] <RikudoSennin> bbyte: hmmm, I would recommend using $.post rather then $.ajax, but whatever suits you
[08:45:29] <bbyte> yeah, i'm just used to it :p
[08:45:43] <bbyte> i can't figure out why it doesn't do the post though
[08:45:49] <mister> RikudoSennin: Hmm i think my explanation was a little messy
[08:45:51] <misterm> fabiobik: I just get a page with a wizard picture, also fyi: downforeveryoneorjustme.com
[08:46:13] <RikudoSennin> also, don't use $el.do1(); $el.do2(); $el.do3(); but $el.do1().do2().do3();
[08:46:22] <kkhacks> hello I have a problem with ajax submit, returned json is not getting handled in success.
[08:46:32] <elriser> i got really confused lol
[08:46:32] <RikudoSennin> misterm: clarify it for me then will you? :P
[08:46:42] <elriser> Sure :)
[08:46:56] <misterm> RikudoSennin: gsh darn it, check your autocomplete, you keep confusing me
[08:47:02] <misterm> :p
[08:47:08] <kkhacks> basically when a json is sent as response, the success function opens the save dialog
[08:47:12] <RikudoSennin> oh
[08:47:13] <RikudoSennin> lol
[08:47:16] <RikudoSennin> there's misterm and mister
[08:47:18] <kkhacks> I instead want to use the value from that json
[08:47:18] <RikudoSennin> xDDDDDD
[08:47:44] <elriser> Let's say I have a Unordered list, with 4 list items inside of it. They're being echoed as is, and I need to reorder them with a specific order.
[08:48:18] <RikudoSennin> elriser: example code
[08:48:19] <elriser> I can target them by # but don't know how to re arrange them using jquery
[08:48:19] <blackspotwiggins> elriser, is there a question somewhere?
[08:48:35] <RikudoSennin> being echoed how?
[08:48:37] <RikudoSennin> PHP?
[08:48:38] <blackspotwiggins> you dont know how to order arrays?
[08:48:40] <blackspotwiggins> wtf?
[08:48:48] <elriser> RikudoSennin: ill set up a jsfiddle
[08:49:18] <blackspotwiggins> what does it matter how it is echoed, RikudoSennin
[08:49:25] <blackspotwiggins> his question is about ordering arrays
[08:49:33] <blackspotwiggins> which shoiuld be programming basics
[08:49:41] <elriser> blackspotwiggins: but after it's being echoed
[08:49:43] <blackspotwiggins> specially when he says it's some special order
[08:49:51] <blackspotwiggins> so ?
[08:49:51] <Lampoon> so  are you
[08:49:58] <ShawnRisk> :(
[08:49:59] <RikudoSennin> blackspotwiggins: what I understand of his question, is that the <li>s are already on the page, and he wants to reorder them in a specific order with jquery
[08:50:03] <eeP> How can i get control over using window.opener
[08:50:06] <RikudoSennin> he never mentioned an array
[08:50:14] <blackspotwiggins> ok, i give up
[08:50:15] <elriser> RikudoSennin: you're right
[08:50:16] <blackspotwiggins> have fun
[08:50:25] <eeP> ?opener
[08:50:28] <bot-t> eeP, #5392 (IE click event error when jQuery ref is passed from a popup ... - Opened 22 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5392
[08:50:51] <kkhacks> hello I wish to know why firefox opens save dialog when the response is sending json with one key and one value?  I use a framework and the request is sent in form of submit.
[08:51:03] <elriser> blackspotwiggins: I can't change the array, because i'm working over a cms that uses a templating system based on liquid and core files are not available to modify
[08:51:35] <blackspotwiggins> kkhacks, firefox doesnt know how to render json
[08:51:39] <blackspotwiggins> you have to handle it with ajax
[08:52:34] <cats4gold> I have a form split into tabs using jquery-ui tabs.  When I tab and give focus to a field on another tab, the form vanishes.  Has anyone else had this problem, and found a solution?  I tried to do set the tab the next field is in as selected on focus, but then the top part of the form vanishes.  It makes the form usable, but it is so ugly.
[08:52:41] <kkhacks> blackspotwiggins: well the request is sent in form of ajaxSubmit.  and the problem happens in the success function which happens after submit.
[08:53:14] <blackspotwiggins> kkhacks, if you are using ajax how in the hell do you get save dialog
[08:53:28] <elriser> RikudoSennin: http://jsfiddle.net/Wx6TF/
[08:53:33] <RikudoSennin> elriser: select all the <li>s you wish to sort and see this: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/arraysort.shtml
[08:54:11] <kkhacks> blackspotwiggins: should I paist the code?  even I don't believe how the success function goes wrong.  I have every thing under document ready and my submit properly does agax.
[08:54:15] <kkhacks> ajax*
[08:54:23] <blackspotwiggins> oh wow, elriser . specific order = reverse?
[08:54:25] <blackspotwiggins> you cant do that in php?
[08:54:54] <misterm> kkhacks: yea, throw it into a pastebin or something
[08:55:00] <elriser> blackspotwiggins: hahaha sorry, my example sucked, i didn't meant reverse order
[08:55:23] <elriser> blackspotwiggins: i'm asking cause it isn't alphabeticalley, nor reverse :/
[08:55:31] <elriser> *mean
[08:55:49] <blackspotwiggins> how should it be ordered then?
[08:56:49] <blackspotwiggins> anything you could sort by in js
[08:56:53] <blackspotwiggins> you can do in php
[08:57:07] <kkhacks> misterm: jsut paisting will give you the handle
[08:57:50] <elriser> RikudoSennin: I'm reading that link!
[08:57:58] <ShawnRisk> I am not going to post for a 4th time, but I am curious how come all the questions that get asked just go nowhere today?
[08:58:20] <elriser> blackspotwiggins: Let's say I would like to reorder it as I wanted
[08:58:25] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, people come and go. sometimes they feel like answering, sometimes they dont
[08:58:32] <ShawnRisk> I understand
[08:58:36] <blackspotwiggins> this isnt a guaranteed service
[08:58:52] <ShawnRisk> I would answer some, but I just need 2 of my questions figured out and I can be in for hours helping.
[08:59:26] <ShawnRisk> should I repost my question?
[08:59:31] <blackspotwiggins> i think i found it
[08:59:37] <blackspotwiggins> cant see an accordion on that site?
[09:00:24] <Assimilater> does anyone know if there's a plugin for accounting functions like interest, time-value, net-present value, future-net value sorta stuff?
[09:00:50] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: did you look at the note to the friends?  that is where accordion starts.  There is just problems with this, (overlaying) and arrows not pointing right way.
[09:00:58] <kkhacks> misterm: blackspotwiggins here is the code http://pastebin.com/9ZCmNGPT
[09:01:05] <blackspotwiggins> ah didnt notice
[09:01:17] <elriser> RikudoSennin: I understand there are a limited ways of sorting right? My example wasn't too good. I did it again here http://jsfiddle.net/Wx6TF/2/ As far as I understand I am not able to reorder this with the examples on the page you sent me, or maybe i'm worng :S
[09:01:27] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: do you see this now?
[09:01:28] <kkhacks> blackspotwiggins: you will be surprised to know that i indeed use ajax and still i get save dialog
[09:01:45] <misterm> kkhacks: what is "parseInt(2)" for?
[09:02:20] <Know1edge> weird question but how can I use the .last selector but not apply if its a only child?
[09:02:40] <elriser> Maybe i'm using the sorting concept wrong
[09:02:51] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, havent you considered using jquery ui accordion without the css?
[09:02:53] <misterm> kkhacks: is your server serving the response with whack headers or something?
[09:03:36] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: yes and this is the closest I got this to working.  Since this is working with a few problems, I just want to get this working that is all.
[09:03:52] <blackspotwiggins> seems like you are doing it manually
[09:04:08] <kkhacks> misterm: the best part is that when I did download the file I get absolutely perfect data which was supposed to be sent by the server
[09:04:11] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: well can we fix this way?
[09:04:46] <kkhacks> misterm: I am pritty new to all this, can you tel me what is whac header?
[09:06:00] <misterm> kkhacks: "whack" is a phrase that means "messed up"
[09:06:28] <kkhacks> misterm: well it works some times
[09:06:35] <kkhacks> but now a days it does not work at all
[09:07:28] <kkhacks> misterm: i feel problem is in the success function at the time when it accesses the key called message
[09:07:43] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: you are looking into this or still working on other problems?
[09:07:52] <misterm> kkhacks: why do you feel that?
[09:07:56] <kkhacks> misterm: do you see any other thing
[09:07:57] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, looking at it
[09:08:01] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[09:08:52] <kkhacks> misterm: well because all other things are not really related to the response, its plain dom manipulation.  And
[09:09:26] <kkhacks> blackspotwiggins: did you look at the code dude?  I am also as surprised as you r
[09:09:32] <blackspotwiggins> kkhacks, not yet
[09:09:35] <misterm> kkhacks: what happens if you change that line?
[09:09:50] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, that html looks messy
[09:09:51] <kkhacks> misterm: change it to?
[09:10:01] <misterm> kkhacks: something else?
[09:10:14] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: very
[09:10:22] <kkhacks> do you just want me to comment it out?
[09:10:24] <misterm> kkhacks: like, remove it completely, or change it to something else
[09:10:33] <Aric_> Question, I'm having problem setting a variable with .getJSON ... http://www.pastie.org/private/rhyjixdij1t6dfhn5jjgq
[09:10:34] <kkhacks> misterm: do you think I just comment it out?
[09:10:37] <Aric_> anyone can help?
[09:11:08] <misterm> kkhacks: if you want to fix a problem, you have to figure out what the problem is exactly, and process of elimination is a pretty good way to do that
[09:11:25] <misterm> kkhacks: are you sure the plugin you're using isnt doing something screwy behind your back?
[09:11:31] <kkhacks> misterm: i will try this
[09:11:57] <kkhacks> misterm: will you be around?  actually its a desperate situation I am on a deadline and it has come to me as the last resort
[09:14:01] <misterm> kkhacks: I dunno, if Im not around someone else might help you
[09:14:15] <misterm> kkhacks: you will get *much* better help if you have a live demo of the problem though
[09:14:33] <phlp> ShawnRisk: your problem is that there are two click handlers on the link. yours and the drupal fieldset toggle
[09:14:57] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/18/
[09:15:02] <blackspotwiggins> maybe that'll work
[09:15:07] <blackspotwiggins> but its a huge mess of code
[09:15:12] <blackspotwiggins> impossible to maintain
[09:15:17] <blackspotwiggins> make it simpler
[09:15:32] <blackspotwiggins> and use jqueryui accordion that solves this problem for you
[09:15:42] <Aric_> http://www.pastie.org/private/rhyjixdij1t6dfhn5jjgq <- can someone help with my syntax, i just want to set the var reload to the reload data in the json result
[09:16:39] <eddiemonge> $.getJSON('jsondata/dashboard', function(data) { reload = data.reload*1000; });
[09:16:39] <bot-t> (2 hours 40 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell eddiemonge are you using $( "body" ) outside of doc ready?
[09:16:54] <Aric_> eddiemonge: ty
[09:19:10] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: still overlaying and if I click the second one that is not closing the first one.  Do you see these two things?
[09:19:29] <blackspotwiggins> i cant help you any more
[09:19:38] <blackspotwiggins> you are so far into spaghetti code world
[09:20:09] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: really?
[09:20:30] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[09:20:39] <blackspotwiggins> the markup is so convoluted
[09:20:39] <ShawnRisk> nuts :(
[09:20:46] <ShawnRisk> can anyone else help me?
[09:20:47] <blackspotwiggins> you write your own implementation of accordion
[09:20:57] <bbyte> hmm
[09:21:11] <blackspotwiggins> you probably have 20 different js files
[09:21:16] <blackspotwiggins> every one of them doing something
[09:21:20] <blackspotwiggins> and you cant grasp all of them
[09:21:24] <blackspotwiggins> hence the problem
[09:21:32] <bbyte> i finished my web app but since my json data (through api) was on a different server, i always just used $output = 'jsonhere' in php
[09:21:43] <bbyte> so now i'm getting the data from a url
[09:21:49] <bbyte> but the problem is that it's also saving the headers
[09:23:07] <eddiemonge> bbyte: code?
[09:23:22] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: I did and it didn't work
[09:23:39] <blackspotwiggins> and that means what exactly?
[09:23:40] <Aric_> eddiemonge: that didnt work?
[09:23:43] <hariom> Hi, I am using $('form#form-name').submit() to submit the form but it looks like form is getting submit by default before I can validate and call $('form#form-name').submit()
[09:23:51] <blackspotwiggins> you cant make it work because of the horrible markup
[09:23:58] <bbyte> hmm wait, i'm using CURLOPT_HEADER, true in my curlget function
[09:24:01] <bbyte> probably the cause :)
[09:24:16] <hariom> How to stop the behavior of default form submit. I need to validate it first and if everything fine, I am calling $('form#form-name').submit()  to submit
[09:24:25] <hariom> Note that the submit button has type='submit'
[09:24:50] <quicksilver> set up a submit handler
[09:24:54] <quicksilver> and return either true or false
[09:25:04] <quicksilver> depending if you want it to actually submit.
[09:25:07] <bbyte> sorry, was indeed the problem
[09:25:39] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: will you know I am using a CMS right?
[09:25:55] <Aric_> syntax help? http://www.pastie.org/private/rhyjixdij1t6dfhn5jjgq
[09:25:56] <hariom> quicksilver: I want to submit the form on $('form#form-name').submit() . Submit button has onclick event. I want to disable the default form submit behavior
[09:26:44] <hariom> quicksilver: onclick of submit event, I have something like ('input#submit-button').live('click', function() { .... });
[09:27:16] <hariom> Inside this I validate the form inputs and if everything fine, I want to submit the form.
[09:27:58] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, that doesnt change that markup is bad
[09:28:39] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: I know let me try something
[09:28:47] <eddiemonge> Aric_: whats being actually returned? have a live link?
[09:29:05] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: if I make this better will that help you?
[09:29:37] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk, maybe if im around
[09:29:47] <blackspotwiggins> try making jqueryui accordion work
[09:29:53] <eddiemonge> Aric_: and what code did you use with the one i gave you?
[09:30:09] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: I tried and that didn't help out
[09:30:19] <blackspotwiggins> well shit, better give up then
[09:30:25] <quicksilver> hariom: I am not sure if that works. I have always used the return true/false method.
[09:30:25] <ShawnRisk> :(
[09:30:37] <cbobo> If I try to $.get a url that is a redirect is that a problem?
[09:30:47] <blackspotwiggins> cbobo, somewhat
[09:30:55] <eddiemonge> hariom: and that validation to the forms .submit(). if it fails, do preventDefault and the form wont submit
[09:31:03] <cbobo> How is is somewhat?
[09:31:07] <blackspotwiggins> firefox will do the redirect
[09:31:12] <blackspotwiggins> but without proper headers
[09:31:19] <blackspotwiggins> like x-requested-with
[09:31:24] <blackspotwiggins> and anything you set on it
[09:31:37] <blackspotwiggins> it'll be fixed in firefox7 or 8 i think
[09:32:03] <blackspotwiggins> cbobo, check this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=553888
[09:32:08] <cbobo> So your saying that I am unable to use $.get() with a url that is redirected?
[09:32:16] <blackspotwiggins> no it'll work
[09:32:27] <Aric_> eddiemonge: code you gave didnt work
[09:32:33] <eddiemonge> Aric_: how did you use it?
[09:32:34] <Aric_> let me see if i can get something in console
[09:32:42] <cbobo> Well, when I try to get the url using .get() it just shows up as a 302
[09:32:47] <hariom> thank you quicksilver and eddiemonge.
[09:33:02] <cbobo> in my console, of firebug
[09:33:10] <Aric_> var reload = $.getJSON('widgets/reload/w/' + id, function(data) { reload = data.reload*1000; });
[09:33:12] <cbobo> and then everything stops
[09:33:13] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: is this better: http://jsfiddle.net/4WZLC/20/
[09:33:19] <Aric_> i also added "var" inside teh end brackets
[09:33:23] <Aric_> and played around with it
[09:33:24] <Aric_> none worked
[09:33:42] <Aric_> took o the beginning var reload etc
[09:33:46] <eddiemonge> Aric_: no. var reload; $.getJSON('widgets/reload/w/' + id, function(data) { reload = data.reload*1000; });
[09:34:02] <eddiemonge> getJSON does not return anything useful for what you want to do
[09:34:12] <swiggy> i am using jquery ui - sortable on a table (well more specificly the <tbody> of the table - so the items being sorted are the <trs> ONLY) -- but when i start to sort a TR - the width of the item being sorted changes (it shrinks)
[09:34:16] <swiggy> how can i change that?
[09:34:25] <blackspotwiggins> ShawnRisk seems like you only took out the irrelevant bits, which is good
[09:34:27] <swiggy> i have the static width of the <tds> but it still changes
[09:34:30] <blackspotwiggins> but fieldsets are still the same
[09:34:45] <blackspotwiggins> also i dont see the problem with that fiddle, whats not working there?
[09:34:51] <eddiemonge> swiggy: change the tr to have a static width?
[09:35:19] <Aric_> http://www.pastie.org/private/gpbmwf1mel4dsrs4hpvq
[09:35:42] <ShawnRisk> blackspotwiggins: did you see the live site?
[09:35:52] <blackspotwiggins> yes, but
[09:35:58] <blackspotwiggins> if it works in fiddle
[09:36:03] <blackspotwiggins> there is other shit intefering
[09:36:12] <here4thegear> So, I have a hidden field who's value is constantly being edited via js. When its value changes I would like that to trigger a function. does .live("change", function(){}); accomplish this?
[09:36:14] <swiggy> ut dies eddiemonge
[09:36:22] <swiggy> tr style="width:100%;"
[09:36:28] <phlp> ShawnRisk: like the drupal fieldset toggle that i already mentioned
[09:36:29] <swiggy> and then the <tds> also have width set
[09:36:54] <eddiemonge> Aric_: dont use setInterval, use setTimeout with a function that calls itself
[09:37:13] <cbobo> Okay, here is my issue:  if I call $.get('valid_url'); it is saying in the firebug consle "302 Moved Temporaly"
[09:37:36] <cbobo> if I past in the url that the .get is trying to call then it works fine
[09:37:39] <ihp> how can i get also closing li tags of ul list in ie with alert($("#area").html());
[09:37:57] <eddiemonge> Aric_: what exactly is it you are trying to do. explain in human sentences
[09:37:58] <ihp> firefox gets it correctly
[09:38:16] <ShawnRisk> phlp: where?  I remember someone saying that before.
[09:38:17] <eddiemonge> swiggy: not percentages, but pixels
[09:38:22] <here4thegear> cbobo: maybe you need to use $.get(valid_url) instead because the way you have it it is trying to get a url called valid_url
[09:38:47] <eddiemonge> cbobo: the browser will still say 302, check the response headers
[09:38:56] <eddiemonge> cbobo: use the new location
[09:39:00] <Aric__> eddiemonge: i got disconnected
[09:39:02] <Aric__> [12:35] <Aric_> eddiemonge: didn't work... it's reloading every 1ms meaning it didnt get the reload variable which should be 10*1000 so 10secs between reload [12:35] <Aric_> http://www.pastie.org/private/gpbmwf1mel4dsrs4hpvq
[09:39:10] <Aric__> thats last i said/saw
[09:39:16] <here4thegear> cbobo: I'm assuming that valid_url is a variable previously set.
[09:39:16] <eddiemonge> ihp: the closing li tags arent necessary
[09:39:34] <cbobo> anyway, i am going to just try and put in the url that it is being redirected to
[09:39:40] <Aric__> eddiemonge: if i do "var reload= 10000;" it works so i know its the json part
[09:39:41] <ihp> they are in strict
[09:39:48] <swiggy> still shrinks
[09:39:49] <eddiemonge> Aric_: what exactly is it you are trying to do. explain in human sentences
[09:39:52] <cbobo> including ssl, so I will just do https://valid.url.stuff/stuff/etc
[09:39:53] <swiggy> even with pixel set
[09:40:13] <phlp> ShawnRisk: collapse.js it may not be interfering now since your click was moved from the a but there is still another click handler on the a for this drupal fieldset collapse
[09:40:20] <eddiemonge> ihp: they dont have to be according to the specs
[09:40:33] <Aric__> eddiemonge: Just retrieve the reload time from /widgets/reload/w/widgetName, which in this case is "10" and then implement that down further
[09:40:40] <eddiemonge> cbobo: are you on a http page trying to grab the https part?
[09:40:43] <ShawnRisk> phlp: how do I fix this?
[09:40:49] <cbobo> eddiemonge: yes
[09:41:00] <eddiemonge> Aric__: do you have a live link with the code i gave you not working?
[09:41:02] <ihp> eddiemonge, so there is no way of getting them on ie?
[09:41:07] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ cbobo
[09:41:07] <bot-t> cbobo, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[09:41:11] <cbobo> not even trying to grab it, just send data to it
[09:41:14] <Aric__> eddiemonge: the url returns --> {"name":"Name","title":"Title","reload":"10"}
[09:41:17] <swiggy> i figured it out
[09:41:19] <Aric__> i need to just get Title
[09:41:23] <swiggy> i had to set the tbody to have a static width
[09:41:26] <Aric__> i mean Reload
[09:41:31] <eddiemonge> Aric__: thats not what i asked
[09:41:52] <ihp> eddiemonge, i put ul inside comment marks and then removed the comments and then it gave the ending tags
[09:42:06] <phlp> ShawnRisk: well one way would be to .unbind('click') but as far as disabling it in drupal i couldn't say because i dont use it
[09:42:13] <ihp> but thats kinda weird
[09:42:17] <here4thegear> I have a hidden field who's value is constantly being edited via js. When its value changes I would like that to trigger a function. does .live("change", function(){}); accomplish this?
[09:42:34] <cbobo> so you are saying that if I my user is connected to http:// and then I can not make $.get(https://) call?
[09:43:03] <Aric__> eddiemonge: http://www.pastie.org/private/at2j8bcpecsrkrmqj3hvng
[09:43:11] <swiggy> everyone needs to know their rights! Read this BULLSHIT that the government is trying todo.. { STAND UP AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE! } http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_IP_Act
[09:43:27] <eddiemonge> ihp: that made no sense to me what you just said
[09:43:29] <swiggy> United States is turning into Libya! HORRAY!!....... *smh*
[09:43:43] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ here4thegear
[09:43:44] <bot-t> here4thegear, Try It And See
[09:43:48] <cbobo> is this true?
[09:43:50] <ShawnRisk> phlp: I will look in drupal, but could you add that to the jsfiddle?
[09:44:24] <eddiemonge> cbobo: what does chrome's inspector tell you when you try?
[09:44:39] <cbobo> I will try in chrome now
[09:44:57] <phlp> ShawnRisk: it wouldn't make any difference the drupal code is not in the jsfiddle. $('.webform-component-fieldset legend a').unbind('click')
[09:44:58] <cbobo> but, first I am going to update the $.get() to the full https path with out redirect
[09:44:58] <here4thegear> I was totally unaware that #jquery was an activism room :-) j/k swiggy: I'm with yah
[09:45:32] <ihp> eddiemonge, i made the <!-- <ul><li>cdfedfd</li></ul> --> then removed comments on jquery and then it gave closing li tags
[09:45:57] <eddiemonge> ihp: whats your code? how are you "removing the comments on jquery"?
[09:45:58] <here4thegear> eddiemonge: I guess what I'm really getting at is... is that the best method even if it does work. but, to your point I will tias
[09:46:29] <ShawnRisk> phlp: where do I put this, can I put this just before return false?
[09:46:50] <ihp> eddiemonge, st.(/<!--/,"");
[09:47:02] <ihp> eddiemonge, st.replace(/<!--/,"");
[09:47:30] <ihp> i didn't find any other way to get closing li tags
[09:47:45] <phlp> ShawnRisk: no put it at the beginning of your code. before the hide()
[09:47:55] <swiggy> i know that the link was offtopic
[09:48:03] <swiggy> but it needs to be known and spread throughout
[09:48:08] <ihp> why doesn't ie just give me what really is there, why is it editing?
[09:48:17] <eddiemonge> ihp: did the original markup have them?
[09:48:21] <ihp> yes
[09:48:41] <eddiemonge> ie doesnt like closing tags
[09:50:03] <ihp> i was kinda hoping somebody would have solved this already
[09:50:38] <ShawnRisk> phlp: when I do that there is overlay on the second and third and no slide down
[09:50:42] <eddiemonge> do you really need the closing tags?
[09:50:47] <ihp> yes
[09:51:44] <eddiemonge> for what?
[09:51:57] <Gho5t> i'm getting a jquery validate exception on the focusCleanup method
[09:52:07] <ihp> because it's correct
[09:52:07] <Gho5t> Error: $.validator.methods[method] is undefined
[09:52:19] <Gho5t> no idea what i need to do to fix this
[09:52:24] <eddiemonge> ihp: besides that
[09:52:27] <cbobo> Okay how can I get around this Same Orgin Policy?
[09:52:47] <cbobo> The data on my form I would like to send to a SSL site, and not a non SSL site
[09:53:02] <eddiemonge> cbobo: your form should be on https as well
[09:54:00] <cbobo> Why is the Same Orgin Policy even in place?
[09:54:03] <cbobo> for ports
[09:54:18] <blackspotwiggins> security
[09:54:31] <ihp> eddiemonge, prolly not beside that, but it sucks to give up a good practise
[09:54:49] <blackspotwiggins> the policy means exactly that - same origin
[09:54:54] <cbobo> so how the heck do we do this
[09:55:06] <blackspotwiggins> dont serve mixed content
[09:55:10] <cbobo> make an ssl iframe that loads up, and then the form is submited through the ssl iframe?
[09:55:10] <aaronmcadam> anyone here using underscore?
[09:55:17] <eddiemonge> ihp: how are you giving up a good practice?
[09:55:21] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, ive used it
[09:55:32] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying to do something with templates
[09:55:35] <aaronmcadam> http://www.pastie.org/2290762
[09:55:40] <eddiemonge> cbobo: like i said, the form itself should be on https as well
[09:55:41] <aaronmcadam> i dunno if it's possible
[09:55:47] <ihp> eddiemonge, valid strict html
[09:56:02] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, you dont need print
[09:56:07] <eddiemonge> ihp: how are you giving that up? and missing closing li tags is valid strict html
[09:56:09] <aaronmcadam> it's not working either way
[09:56:11] <cbobo> So put the form in an ssl iframe?
[09:56:14] <blackspotwiggins> just inline it
[09:56:24] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean?
[09:56:29] <ihp> it is?
[09:56:51] <blackspotwiggins> entr<%= current_entries>1?"y":"ies" %>
[09:57:00] <etcetera> what's the best way to style jqGrid.
[09:57:03] <blackspotwiggins> or
[09:57:03] <eddiemonge> ihp: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html#edef-LI
[09:57:06] <etcetera> use themeroller?
[09:57:20] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins, it gives me ReferenceError: entry_text is not defined
[09:57:22] <blackspotwiggins> you could pass and object in that has necessary properties
[09:57:24] <eddiemonge> etcetera: jqgrid isnt jquery UI
[09:57:34] <Aple> Hey guys, trying to wrap my head around AJAX with baby steps. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? Trying to just fetch a PHP var from process.php and show it at index.php: index.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448902/ process.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448903/
[09:57:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know but i wanted to see if i could keep that logic in the template
[09:57:59] <Aple> I'd greatly appreciate someone bumping me along in this. Once I get the basics down, I should be good to explore the details for a while.
[09:58:08] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, not a good practice
[09:58:12] <blackspotwiggins> it's possible tho
[09:58:17] <ihp> is it also strict xhtml?
[09:58:31] <etcetera> eddiemonge: I could've swore it respected those identifiers though.
[09:58:37] <etcetera> is there an alternate way to style jqgrid?
[09:58:42] <etcetera> not very well documented.
[09:58:47] <ShawnRisk> phlp: any other thoughts?
[09:58:55] <eddiemonge> ?post @ Aple
[09:58:55] <bot-t> Aple, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[09:59:12] <eddiemonge> Aple: oops sorry should be get, not post see ? post
[09:59:12] <bot-t> Aple, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[09:59:15] <aaronmcadam> ah dude!
[09:59:18] <aaronmcadam> blackEyEz, I got it
[09:59:26] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins, i had to wrap the var in <% %>
[09:59:36] <eddiemonge> ihp: no. xhtml requires opening and closing everything
[09:59:41] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, yeah, it's erb style
[09:59:54] <aaronmcadam> It's a very simple string I'm setting, not convoluted logic
[10:00:05] <eddiemonge> etcetera: just examine the markup and then style it in your css like normal
[10:00:22] <etcetera> right, there's nothing pre-baked?
[10:00:40] <Aple> eddiemonge: Even after setting to post, it still doesn't show the $str var there.
[10:00:48] <aaronmcadam> good stuff
[10:01:18] <Aple> eddiemonge: And it was originally processing as GET according to Firebug
[10:01:29] <Aple> But I've tried it explicitly now too and nuthin'
[10:02:05] <eddiemonge> Aple: look at the docs. look at the examples. they have everything you need to learn to know how to use them
[10:02:16] <eddiemonge> etcetera: i dont know. ask the person who wrote jqgrid
[10:02:17] <aaronmcadam> woop, JavaScript weekly just arrived on my phone :D
[10:02:17] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, check it http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3205
[10:02:28] <etcetera> eddiemonge: fair enough, I just wish the docs were better.
[10:02:35] <blackspotwiggins> depends on prototype, but still
[10:02:40] <aaronmcadam> aye
[10:02:51] <aaronmcadam> normally would just use django's plural tag
[10:02:54] <ihp> eddiemonge, well xhtml strict wont accept it
[10:03:13] <eddiemonge> ihp: like i said, what is it you are trying to do with it?
[10:03:31] <ale> hello, why when I write on a textarea "??" it sends that via ajax as "jQuery1510021222528535872698_1311919860035"..why can this be?
[10:03:48] <ihp> i'm trying to get it exactly as it is typed
[10:03:51] <aaronmcadam> that's a fuckload of code just to pluralise something
[10:03:59] <blackspotwiggins> it does more
[10:04:34] <Aple> eddiemonge: Apparently not or I wouldn't be here.
[10:04:36] <ale> so? how should repair it?
[10:04:47] <Fernandos> what's the purpose of pluralizing?
[10:04:49] <aaronmcadam> might be ok to pluralise arbitrary strings, in this instance I know exactly what word I want
[10:04:56] <eddiemonge> Aple: did you look at the examples at all?
[10:05:04] <eddiemonge> ihp: for what purpose?
[10:05:07] <ale> can somebody help me please?
[10:05:15] <eddiemonge> ale: how are you sending it?
[10:05:16] <blackspotwiggins> Fernandos, you need to insert dynamic strings
[10:05:24] <blackspotwiggins> like n apples
[10:05:32] <blackspotwiggins> it might be one or might be more
[10:05:38] <blackspotwiggins> so this make is Just Work
[10:05:49] <blackspotwiggins> makes itp
[10:05:53] <Fernandos>  a hammer on a trivial problem
[10:06:00] <ale> eddiemonge: via ajax, I have a form, which contains just a textarea, and I write any string with the "??"
[10:06:06] <etcetera> eddiemonge: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1415439/change-style-of-jqgrid
[10:06:12] <blackspotwiggins> is there a simpler way to solve it?
[10:06:16] <etcetera> it seems jqgrid jives with jquery UI themes.
[10:06:18] <ihp> eddiemonge, what diffirence does that means what i'm going to do with it?
[10:06:28] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ ale
[10:06:28] <bot-t> ale, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[10:06:36] <Fernandos> etcetera: what license does jqeryui have?
[10:06:43] <Aple> eddiemonge: Yes, but I think I'm trying to do something different. In the examples, they are passing data to a processing form. In my example, I'm trying to pull data from another script.
[10:06:53] <eddiemonge> ihp: well if you are just operating on the structure then it doesnt matter
[10:07:00] <etcetera> Fernandos: MIT / GPL
[10:07:13] <eddiemonge> Aple: thats why i said look at see ? get
[10:07:13] <Aple> eddiemonge: So what ends up happening is it's seeing process.php, but not fetching the variable from process.php
[10:07:13] <bot-t> Aple, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[10:07:27] <eddiemonge> ? ajax.get @ Aple
[10:07:28] <bot-t> Aple, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[10:07:57] <eddiemonge> Aple: and it doesnt matter if you use get or post. they both return data from the server if it send its in the responseText
[10:08:40] <ihp> so there isn't any nifty trick to make ie give closing </li> tags too, but i need to add those manually?
[10:08:41] <Fernandos> heh..does this work with gpl/mit then? http://phpgrid.com/downloads/
[10:09:30] <thm> is there a common pattern for updating id attributes when cloning elements?
[10:09:31] <solars> does anyone know a plugin/extension/example for datepicker to allow daterange selection? like 2 pickers tied together with necessary restrictions... I found something but forgot again
[10:09:34] <ihp> manually meaning writing a function to add those
[10:10:17] <Aple> eddiemonge: I'll check into it more. I'm not sure how to tell if it's sending it in the responseText though.
[10:11:11] <eddiemonge> ihp: like i said, what are you trying to do?
[10:11:24] <eddiemonge> solars: theres jqueryui
[10:11:38] <eddiemonge> Aple: look in firebug to see the response
[10:11:59] <solars> eddiemonge, how do you mean? is there anything to support picking ranges?
[10:12:17] <ale> eddiemonge: but I can't show it cause I send it via ajax to a php, the thing is that the data is already being sent as that strange string
[10:12:21] <Aple> eddiemonge++ thanks man
[10:12:29] <eddiemonge> solars: yeah i think there is one in the examples too
[10:12:58] <Aple> eddiemonge: Isn't $.get the same thing as $.ajax ({ type: 'get' }); ?
[10:13:00] <eddiemonge> ale: what strange string? firebug shows whats being sent and received
[10:13:15] <solars> eddiemonge, but I mean 2 connected ones, for date ranges
[10:13:33] <eddiemonge> Aple: yeah but you need more options when using .ajax. the docs show what .get is doing exactly
[10:13:41] <ale> eddiemonge: I know, it's sending this string: "jQuery1510021222528535872698_1311919860035"
[10:13:55] <ale> eddiemonge: it's converting "??" as "jQuery1510021222528535872698_1311919860035"
[10:14:10] <eddiemonge> solars: did you even look at the examples? http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range
[10:14:17] <eddiemonge> ale: what is your code?
[10:14:25] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[10:14:46] <ale> eddiemonge: in fiddle is working fine, but not in my pc
[10:15:02] <ale> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/Qvnqc/
[10:15:09] <ale> eddiemonge: it's something like that
[10:15:59] <Aple> eddiemonge: Even when trying to fetch data with GET, it isn't getting the var. index.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448918/ process.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448919/
[10:16:09] <aaronmcadam> can't remember why it does that
[10:16:56] <eddiemonge> Aple: i think you need to read up on php. that script does nothing
[10:17:11] <eddiemonge> Aple: your js is fine
[10:17:33] <Aple> I know process.php doesn't do anything. It's just holding a var. I'm just trying to figure out how to fetch that var with ajax
[10:17:40] <eddiemonge> Aple: except you need event.preventDefault() in the click function
[10:18:00] <eddiemonge> Aple: like i said, you need to learn php. hint $_GET
[10:18:39] <ale> eddiemonge: why can jquery changing the ?? to that string?
[10:18:41] <aaronmcadam> ah man I don't miss php at all
[10:18:48] <ale> it's replacing it
[10:18:53] <eddiemonge> ale: try this http://jsfiddle.net/Qvnqc/1/
[10:21:11] <ale> eddiemonge: no, still not working :/
[10:21:35] <Aple> eddiemonge: That's pretty vague. I know a bit of PHP. Could you just be more specific?
[10:22:13] <Sean-Der> I have a question that I think I can solve with jQuery?
[10:22:29] <Sean-Der> I have a select list with product ids and names
[10:22:47] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: made some progress
[10:22:49] <Sean-Der> Would it be possible when selecting the productid/name to then output the price in a textbox?
[10:22:55] <eddiemonge> ale: how are you trying to send the data?
[10:22:57] <Sean-Der> I want them to be able to tweak the price
[10:23:06] <eddiemonge> Aple: if you know php then that should be all you need
[10:23:22] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: yes
[10:23:33] <ngharo> ale: that "strange" string is jquery doing a jsonp request
[10:23:36] <Aple> -_-
[10:24:10] <Sean-Der> eddiemonge: This can be solved with only jQuery? If I pull the suggested price variable out of my DB with php also it can correspond somehow??!
[10:24:40] <Aple> Anyone else want to help? Trying to fetch a var from one script with ajax
[10:24:46] <ale> eddiemonge: I am doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/bP3Nd/
[10:24:47] <aaronmcadam> ah cool, spill Know1edge
[10:24:54] <ale> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/bP3Nd/
[10:25:00] <jedimind> i just got this in an email from client: "We can still achieve this animation using PHP or something"
[10:25:01] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: I
[10:25:06] <Know1edge> I'll upload a video
[10:25:13] <ale> I am doing just that, it's woking with every string, except "??"
[10:25:13] <jedimind> after i told her that the transitions she wants for this carousel are too taxing client-side
[10:25:25] <ngharo> Aple: you need to `echo` out your data in php if you expect to get it in jquery like your paste shows
[10:25:55] <Aple> Ah
[10:26:01] <Aple> Now I'm getting a response
[10:26:04] <eddiemonge> Aple: if you cant bother to learn the basics, people arent going to spoon feed you through the whole process
[10:27:02] <eddiemonge> ale: http://jsfiddle.net/bP3Nd/1/ and what exactly does firebug show as being sent?
[10:27:05] <Aple> eddiemonge: People don't need to spoon feed people. You don't have to help if you don't want to.
[10:27:24] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: javascript is front end. you still need php to interact with the db
[10:27:25] <Aple> eddiemonge: Sometimes people just can't see things from a certain point of view and need a "bump" to get over that and back on track
[10:27:29] <Ogredude> ok, I've got my autocomplete, on select it fills out the rest of the form and disables the fields.  This is good.  Now, I need to add a bit of behavior where if the user changes the autocomplete form, all the rest of the fields get enabled again.
[10:27:34] <ngharo> ale: try setting dataType: 'html'
[10:27:56] <Ogredude> this'll avoid having a user change existing company information when they autocomplete a company, but allow them to go "Oops, wrong one" and create a new company instead.
[10:27:58] <Aple> eddiemonge: I've never done anything with AJAX other than read stuff about it, but even so, I can't do anything that isn't directly copying a snippet because a lot of it doesn't make sense until I get my hands dirty with it.
[10:28:03] <ngharo> ale: jquery replaces '?' with that string when doing jsonp.  I think specifying dataType will prevent that
[10:28:09] <Ogredude> Not sure how to get that behavior though.
[10:28:14] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: I am going to loop out all my variables so that is not an issue so I will just call it out of my product array prodid[1] prodname[1] like I do with my select form
[10:28:17] <eddiemonge> Aple: have you ever worked with forms in php?
[10:28:27] <ale> ngharo: I had dataType as JSON, 1 min
[10:28:33] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: But how can I get the text box to change depending on my select field?
[10:29:09] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: use .change on the select and .val() on the textbox
[10:29:11] <Aple> ngharo: This is returning a response in Firebug so I'm happy, but it's not printing $str in #output: index.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448925/ var.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448927/
[10:29:15] <Aple> eddiemonge: Yeah
[10:29:29] <Aple> eddiemonge: I can send stuff via GET/POST all day and night. Input it in db's, pull it out.
[10:29:35] <eddiemonge> Aple: ajax is exactly the same as a normal form as far as php is concerned
[10:29:46] <Sean-Der> Thanks you copying those functions into a document will review
[10:29:48] <Aple> Hm
[10:30:00] <Sean-Der> Can .val() access PHP variables?
[10:30:10] <Aple> eddiemonge: So url: 'process.php', is the exact same thing as submitting the form
[10:30:20] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: no. but your PHP is passed into the javascript in your ajax calls
[10:30:41] <ngharo> Aple: you must use the 'success' handler in your ajax()  call to append the output from php to the div
[10:30:45] <ngharo> see ?append
[10:30:45] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:30:55] <eddiemonge> Aple: yes. see ? append
[10:30:55] <bot-t> Aple, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:30:57] <eddiemonge> lol
[10:31:02] <Sean-Der> I am not using Ajax calls :/ I don't know any I am using .load() to call pages that contains different forms
[10:31:32] <Aple> Ok, I think I've got it now
[10:31:49] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: http://codebomber.com/_cms/layout-designer.swf
[10:31:57] <Aple> Now I can fetch the var (post or get) in var.php, and with success: function(), I can append it to #output
[10:32:27] <aaronmcadam> Know1edge, nice interface so far
[10:32:32] <ngharo> you're not fetching get or post vars, you're grabbing the output (wahtever you'd see in your browser directly using the same request)
[10:32:41] <aaronmcadam> is it on github?
[10:33:01] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: .load is an ajax call
[10:33:03] <aaronmcadam> industrial cms?
[10:33:10] <ngharo> Aple: if you need to send lots of data back to jquery, use json_encode() php call
[10:33:21] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: Not yet, gonna open source it though
[10:33:27] <aaronmcadam> good man!
[10:33:30] <Know1edge> :)
[10:33:34] <Know1edge> check this out
[10:33:35] <aaronmcadam> can you hit me?
[10:33:40] <aaronmcadam> @aaronmcadam?
[10:33:44] <aaronmcadam> when u do?
[10:33:55] <ngharo> ?p @ Sean-Der
[10:33:55] <aaronmcadam> if it's not ages away of course
[10:33:55] <bot-t> Sean-Der, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:34:02] <Know1edge> sure thin
[10:34:03] <Know1edge> g
[10:34:09] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam:  am @egdelwonk
[10:34:13] <ihp> eddiemonge, i found a fix, if you interested, http://icodesnip.com/snippet/javascript/fix-normalized-broken-lists-in-ie-think-innerhtml
[10:34:17] <Aple> ngharo++
[10:34:38] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: http://codebomber.com/_cms/IndustrialCMS3.swf another neat feature of my cms
[10:34:40] <Aple> ngharo: Yeah, I'll have to study JSON more, but right now I'm pretty stoked about learning this shtuff
[10:34:44] <aaronmcadam> very nice work tho, for a first draft, or had u built the ui already
[10:35:01] <Aple> ngharo: So you have to echo everything is you want to capture it via $.ajax() eh?
[10:35:03] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah the quick edit
[10:35:07] <Know1edge> i built the grid ui when i first talked to you
[10:35:11] <aaronmcadam> i tried implementing something similar myself
[10:35:17] <ngharo> Aple: yes
[10:35:30] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam:  i did an image edit / swap function too
[10:35:46] <Know1edge> bout 3/4th the way in the video
[10:35:51] <ihp> apparently ie calls it normalization i.e. screwing perfectly good markup is normalization :)
[10:36:29] <aaronmcadam> cool dude!
[10:36:32] <Know1edge> :-D
[10:36:33] <aaronmcadam> I've followed you
[10:36:36] <Know1edge> it's coming together
[10:37:00] <ale> ngharo: thanks, now it's working, any idea why "hey thereee dude!¿? ?? !!" has been written as "hey thereee dude!Â¿? ?? !!"
[10:37:21] <Sean-Der> How do I simulate the DB and .PHP I am .load from?
[10:37:21] <Ogredude> ah I got it
[10:37:29] <eddiemonge> ngharo: you know whats funny, the last example on the jquery.get page is exactly what aple was asking for. i know because i wrote it for just such an occasion. love it when people read the docs ...
[10:37:34] <Sean-Der> I can host it on my development box?
[10:37:40] <Ogredude> attached a .keypress event to the autocomplete field that made it clear out and enable all the rest of the textfields
[10:38:00] <eddiemonge> ale: thats your encoding messing it up
[10:38:10] <ale> ok, thanks
[10:38:18] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: simulate it?
[10:38:34] <Sean-Der> It wont display the products array.
[10:38:49] <ngharo> paste some code bro
[10:39:01] <aaronmcadam> Know1edge, dude what's your github name?
[10:39:08] <Sean-Der> http://jsfiddle.net/aaZGQ/
[10:39:20] <Sean-Der> Doesn't show much though
[10:39:24] <Gho5t> i'm really having a hard time debugging something. i have an input that when on keypress is running a validation function using jquery. i removed the onchange handler and when i type in it the validation routine is still running
[10:39:30] <Gho5t> no idea how/why
[10:39:41] <kkhacks> misterm: hello, I am back
[10:39:53] <kkhacks> misterm: I tried your solution of elemination
[10:40:00] <Know1edge> aaronmcadam: egdelwonk
[10:40:05] <Gho5t> please help
[10:40:07] <kkhacks> misterm: but my browser still gives me the save dialog.
[10:40:20] <ngharo> Sean-Der: you can just spoon feed your script a json string as a way to 'simulate' data from php land
[10:41:14] <forlong> hi
[10:41:14] <Innocentus> hey, how can I select the parent of an element itself as selector?
[10:41:22] <forlong> why doesn't this work http://jsfiddle.net/7P4Y5/1/ ?
[10:41:30] <Aple> eddiemonge: You know what else is funny? I don't know JSON or what "func": "getNameAndTime" means.
[10:41:38] <Innocentus> f.ex. <parent><element onclick="$('parent'). ...
[10:41:41] <ngharo> ?parent @ Innocentus
[10:41:41] <bot-t> Innocentus, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[10:41:51] <ngharo> Innocentus: dont use onclick :[
[10:42:14] <Innocentus> ngharo: let's pretend, it is ok in this case
[10:42:18] <ngharo> ok ok
[10:42:18] <Aple> eddiemonge: Maybe provide an even more dumbed down example where ajax fetches 1 var from an external script and outputs it on the original page.
[10:42:19] <kkhacks> for those who don't know, I am facing this veard problem.  My ajax submit calls a python action url.  The action returns json.  but in my success function for after submit, my browser opens a save dialog.
[10:42:20] <Innocentus> ngharo: how would it look like
[10:42:26] <ngharo> onclick="$(this).parent()"
[10:42:33] <ngharo> i believe
[10:42:44] <Innocentus> ngharo: thank you
[10:43:38] <eddiemonge> kkhacks: what browser? what happens if you visit the link normally
[10:43:39] <Innocentus> ngharo: and when I want to step 2 up, I simply call them twice?: $(this).parent().parent()?
[10:43:40] <ngharo> kkhacks: thats odd.  inspect the headers of the request.  make sure it's sending text/json
[10:43:41] <kkhacks> misterm: could this be some thing else then?
[10:43:43] <chovy> kkhacks: is the response being served as json?
[10:43:51] <ngharo> ?closest @ Innocentus
[10:43:51] <bot-t> Innocentus, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:43:51] <chovy> in the headers i mean
[10:44:04] <eddiemonge> forlong: you need $(this)
[10:44:08] <kkhacks> chovy: yes
[10:44:13] <kkhacks> the return is json
[10:44:19] <Innocentus> cool
[10:44:24] <forlong> yeah thank you eddiemonge
[10:44:35] <kkhacks> chovy: you know the fact is that when I did download that text file, it shows proper key: value
[10:44:40] <Innocentus> ngharo: very cool
[10:45:14] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to automaticaly check if an element has a state changed?
[10:45:20] <kkhacks> chovy: i can show the code
[10:45:35] <ngharo> kkhacks: have your script send content-type text/json header
[10:45:40] <kkhacks> chovy: the action url is a python code chunk, i use pylons framework
[10:45:49] <Innocentus> ngharo: and when I want to select a class I use $.('.classname') - right?
[10:46:13] <ngharo> ?selectors
[10:46:13] <SoulRaven> i mean if a change the state of an element, i want to check on a time interval that element
[10:46:13] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[10:46:15] <Aple> $('#output').append("<?php echo $_POST['str']; ?>"); returns "unterminated string literal" with a <br /> tag inserted into it at the beginning. Anyone know how to fix that?
[10:46:40] <kkhacks> ngharo: yes it is sending text/json, although some adviced me to do applicaiton/application/json
[10:46:54] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: what kind if "state" change?
[10:47:09] <Aple> I'm assuming it has something to do with putting the PHP in there, but I'm not sure how else to insert that data.
[10:47:12] <misterm> kkhacks: that wasn't a "solution", it was a suggestion for seeing if that line was the problem :-)
[10:47:13] <SoulRaven> disable/enable of a button
[10:47:32] <eddiemonge> Aple: what is that for? are you trying to append the returned data?
[10:47:34] <kkhacks> misterm: well yes
[10:47:50] <kkhacks> misterm: after that i got frustrated and commented every thing inside success
[10:48:08] <kkhacks> misterm: still it behaves the same
[10:48:08] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/G372hcGe
[10:48:12] <Sean-Der> http://jsfiddle.net/aaZGQ
[10:48:17] <Aple> eddiemonge: Yeah
[10:48:22] <eddiemonge> Aple: is the example better now: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ ?
[10:48:30] <Sean-Der> I don't know how to simulate the Ajax reading their examples still lost
[10:48:35] <Sean-Der> I am gonna keep trying
[10:48:39] <Sean-Der> But there is my code
[10:48:49] <SoulRaven> eddiemonge: i have a script for add/remove rows in a table, and i want to disable the remove button when i have only one row in table, but now the buttons is disable on the secound click
[10:48:58] <Aple> eddiemonge: Yeah actually
[10:48:59] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/Thsj4/
[10:49:01] <misterm> kkhacks: my first guess would be either your server is misconfigured or a plugin you're using is doing something weird
[10:49:07] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: you will need to use .live() for those buttons
[10:49:34] <Sean-Der> They are working? Is there going to be an issue
[10:49:35] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: see ? delegate
[10:49:35] <bot-t> SoulRaven, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:49:40] <kkhacks> misterm: I set the headers as specified and it works in other forms in the same application
[10:49:41] <Innocentus> QUESTION: Does fadeIn() / fadeOut() changes also the display- or visibility-css-status of the element?
[10:50:01] <ngharo> display
[10:50:25] <Innocentus> ok
[10:50:27] <Innocentus> thank you
[10:50:40] <misterm> kkhacks: do you have a live demo of the problem?
[10:50:42] <Innocentus> how can I fetch the current value of display? .attributes['display'] ?
[10:50:48] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: those look like they work to me. but you should also see ? prop
[10:50:48] <bot-t> SoulRaven, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:50:58] <eddiemonge> ?visible @ Innocentus
[10:50:59] <bot-t> Innocentus, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[10:51:00] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: I thought delegate was a more elegant version of live
[10:51:09] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: or .css('display')
[10:51:13] <kkhacks> misterm: www.gnukhata.org
[10:51:22] <kkhacks> misterm: there you will get a link to the live demo
[10:51:25] <atriv> Hey all, Question: can i put arbitrary values in a dom element and then access them with jquery. i.e <li class ="blah" myval="turkey">
[10:51:31] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: cool, and how can I select all non-visible elements? negate the whole selector with a !?
[10:51:38] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: '!'
[10:51:38] <ngharo> ?data @ atriv
[10:51:38] <bot-t> atriv, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[10:51:52] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: .not(':visible')
[10:52:04] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: I need to combine it with a close-selector
[10:52:08] <kkhacks> misterm: just try that, if you don't get the problem I am rest ashured that it is an old demo because every thing was working 4 days before
[10:52:09] <ihp> is there a function to get all tags in lowercase?
[10:52:20] <atriv> ngharo: numerical ids
[10:52:27] <misterm> kkhacks: you said the problem occurs in firefox?
[10:52:28] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: jQuery('this').closest('.classname').
[10:52:32] <Aple> eddiemonge: Thoughts on the "unterminated string literal"? Should I put the return data in a function or something?
[10:52:40] <ngharo> atriv: <foo data-bar="123">  -- $('foo').data('bar') returns 123
[10:52:41] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: how can I now check additionally for the visible ones?
[10:52:48] <kkhacks> misterm: yes
[10:52:58] <misterm> kkhacks: what version? and how do I recreate the problem?
[10:53:02] <atriv> ngharo: thank you
[10:53:03] <kkhacks> misterm: chrom also did it
[10:53:05] <Sazpaimon_> anyone here use jquery cookie plugin in IE?
[10:53:05] <Aple> eddiemonge: Your example works fine and makes sense, but I'm just off on a trail after this "unterminated string literal" thing now so I'll be prepared in case I encounter it again
[10:53:11] <Sazpaimon_> I cannot seem to get it to set cookies
[10:53:15] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: find(':visible')
[10:53:38] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: or use filter to filter out the currently selected objects see ? filter
[10:53:38] <bot-t> Innocentus, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:53:51] <eddiemonge> Aple: ??
[10:53:51] <Sazpaimon_> I mean, I can do $.cookie("cookie", 1, {expires: 1,  path: '/'}) just fine, but then $.cookie("cookie") is still null
[10:53:56] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: jQuery('this').closest('.classname').find(':visible') would do it?
[10:54:12] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: and for not-visible ones jQuery('this').closest('.classname').not(':visible')     ?
[10:54:21] <kkhacks> misterm: tell me if you face a problem else I will update the demo
[10:54:24] <SoulRaven> eddiemonge: my problem is that i want to detect if remains only 1 row, before the secound click, on the last click
[10:54:34] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: how about showing some markup with what you are trying to select?
[10:54:36] <kkhacks> i'll tell the admin to put it up
[10:54:43] <misterm> kkhacks: ok, I need to know how to create the problem in order to know if I get it
[10:54:56] <SoulRaven> now, the button is disabled after the secound click, when remains only 1 row
[10:54:57] <Aple> eddiemonge: $('output').append("<?php echo $_POST['str']; ?>"); is returning "unterminated string literal" in Firebug.
[10:55:02] <ngharo> out to lunch.  good luck eddiemonge :)
[10:55:09] <misterm> kkhacks: also, what version of firefox are you using?
[10:55:13] <kkhacks> misterm: can you come on a private chat
[10:55:20] <Aple> eddiemonge: Starts at the $_POST. It's inputting a <br /> tag right before $_POST['str'] for some reason.
[10:55:23] <SoulRaven> and i want to disable the button, imediatly after the remove of the secound row
[10:55:25] <misterm> kkhacks: ok, msg me
[10:55:27] <eddiemonge> SoulRaven: use .length on on the table's tr rows
[10:55:36] <ale> Does anyone know any good geolocation service?
[10:55:39] <eddiemonge> Aple: no. there is no php  in the javascript
[10:56:04] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/Thsj4/
[10:56:23] <eddiemonge> Aple: the ajax sends/recieves data to an external script. the return is the html output of that script, not the source
[10:56:42] <Aple> AHh

[10:56:50] <eddiemonge> ale thats a pretty generic question
[10:57:29] <ale> I want to define user's language when it access the website, I need a geolocation API, or do you know something else?
[10:58:12] <Aple> eddiemonge: Out of curiosity, can I accomplish the same thing with the post type?
[10:59:18] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: how can I get the id of a jquery selected element?
[10:59:23] <eddiemonge> Aple: yes but post is really for sending data
[10:59:30] <misterm> ale: I would probably just ask them what language they wanted, you'll probably have to do that anyway...though I suppose you could try to make a best guess for a default
[10:59:47] <eddiemonge> ale: its usually better to let the user decide what language they want to use
[11:00:01] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: .attr('id')
[11:01:01] <Aple> eddiemonge: I see.
[11:01:10] <ale> eddiemonge: I know but for a start, if the user just knows spanish, I can't put the page in english by default
[11:01:30] <ale> eddiemonge: so I should first check the country from where it is connection
[11:01:34] <ale> connecting*
[11:01:57] <Aple> eddiemonge: Still not appending. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/448943/ something wrong with that function(data) method?
[11:02:05] <Aple> I get the feeling I'm doing that rong.
[11:03:38] <eddiemonge> Aple: are you sending json? if not, then its just data.
[11:03:53] <Aple> What's the diff between JSON and "just data"?
[11:04:03] <Aple> I'd prefer to do this with "just data" for right now.
[11:04:07] <Sean-Der> Is there a way to take a PHP array to a variable?
[11:04:29] <Aple> I fully appreciate and will learn JSON very next, but right now just trying to get this barebones example working so I can comment it up for myself for future reference
[11:04:30] <Aple> :)
[11:04:36] <Sean-Der> I think I can use the productID to call the array indice that equals the price
[11:04:38] <ale> please?
[11:04:41] <Sean-Der> If it works like PHP
[11:05:43] <eddiemonge> json is just data but formatted as a key value pair
[11:06:16] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: i think you also are confusing where php is used. it is used in the backend code. javascript is in the front end and thus has no idea what php is
[11:07:03] <Sean-Der> http://scratch99.com/web-development/php/creating-javascript-array-dynamically-from-php-array/
[11:07:16] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: I was thinking of something like tihs
[11:09:07] <Sean-Der> Could I possible echo an array where orderid corresponds to my price and then use .val to set the text box?
[11:10:37] <sayakb> hi! is there a way to select a drop menu (HTML <select>)  by element index?
[11:10:39] <Pitel> how can I get size of image, whose url is fetched with ajax? crating $("<img>").attr("src", filename) gives me width and height of 0. I'd like to know the seize before actually appending the image to the page. Because I want to stretch the image, but keep aspect ratio. Or is there some nice trick for this?
[11:12:17] <sayakb> or, maybe select an <option> if i have it captured in a variable by using nth-child selector
[11:12:23] <cohitre> Pitel: you can stretch the image and have it keep the aspect ratio with CSS
[11:12:45] <Pitel> cohitre: how exactly?
[11:12:48] <cohitre> if you only setup one of the width or height properties it will scale the other properly
[11:13:03] <cohitre> $("<img />").css("width", "200%")
[11:14:36] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: completely doesnt apply and that article is kind of bs. if you are loading data you can have php output it in json and then when jquery gets that data, bam, automatic array
[11:14:54] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: how can select a $(this) a child?
[11:15:07] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: $(this).('> .testclass') doesn't work
[11:15:20] <eddiemonge> ?children @ Innocentus

[11:15:27] <sadmicrowave> hey everyone
[11:16:40] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: I know there is json_encode, but I just started with jQuery yesterday. Would you mind pointing out an example or reccomend a place to read up?
[11:17:12] <eddiemonge> ? ajax.get @ Sean-Der

[11:17:30] <eddiemonge> look at the last example. data in that is an array
[11:17:56] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: I want to select all children with class="link" by using the following: $(this).children('.link')
[11:18:02] <Innocentus> eddiemonge: but it doesn't work :(
[11:18:22] <eddiemonge> toddparker: quicktime? really? not html5 video at least?
[11:18:53] <eddiemonge> Innocentus: use find there. children will only find immediate children
[11:20:27] <pr0ton> how do you typecast a number as an int in JS?
[11:21:09] <eddiemonge> parseInt
[11:22:04] <jmancuso> Is there any way to reliably change/replace content in a DOM before it is rendered - such that I could ensure avoiding flicker as the dom gets updated?
[11:22:48] <jmancuso> The only way I can figure out, that seems that it might work, would be to put the calls that update the elements into a script right before </body> and not rely on a callback getting fired on dom load
[11:22:49] <Sazpaimon_> anyone here use jquery cookie plugin in IE? I can do $.cookie("cookie", 1, {expires: 1,  path: '/'}) just fine, but then $.cookie("cookie") is still null

[11:30:46] <karanlyons> Hey all, I have a question about jQuery and manual DOM manipulation.
[11:31:18] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ karanlyons
[11:31:18] <bot-t> karanlyons, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:31:43] <rosco_y> newbie alert: I want to learn how to use jsTree (a jQuery) plugin to display MySQL data in my website--how well do I need to understand ajax?
[11:31:56] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: My, that's a pleasant attitude :D I shall ask away, then.
[11:32:14] <Sazpaimon_> ngharo, null
[11:32:21] <karanlyons> It seems whenever I manually change the DOM (document.body.innerHTML += "<div id='foobar'></div>"), jQuery stops doing everything, active animations, mouseover events, etc.
[11:32:25] <dainbrain> herp
[11:32:31] <ngharo> Sazpaimon_: the fiddle is working for me.
[11:32:38] <Sazpaimon_> strange
[11:32:47] <Sazpaimon_> maybe IE is set strange
[11:32:52] <karanlyons> Is there a way to prevent this from happening, or get everything on the right track again after messing with the DOM?
[11:32:55] <rosco_y> karanlyons: there are a lot of very helpful people here.  Get used to the format, you'll be very glad you did! :)
[11:33:10] <Sazpaimon_> ngharo, which version of IE?
[11:33:20] <ngharo> Sazpaimon_: IE? HAH!
[11:33:23] <ngharo> chrome
[11:33:31] <Sazpaimon_> ngharo, yes, i was saying it isnt working in IE
[11:33:39] <Sazpaimon_> chrome, firefox, opera, all fine
[11:33:49] <Sazpaimon_> actually dont know about opera, but IE isnt working
[11:33:51] <ngharo> can't help ya there.  linux here
[11:34:01] <Sazpaimon_> thats fine
[11:34:10] <ngharo> i'd check security settings
[11:34:52] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: thats how it is in most irc chat rooms. asking to ask is silly
[11:35:01] <ngharo> karanlyons: can you create a demo case showing the problem? see ?jsfiddle
[11:35:01] <bot-t> karanlyons, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[11:35:14] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: I agree, but there are some communites where terrible things go down if you just ask outright.
[11:35:15] <eddiemonge> rosco_y: probably not well at all depending on the plugin
[11:35:22] <karanlyons> ngharo: I've already got one, I'll up it up now.
[11:35:23] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: like which?
[11:35:51] <Sazpaimon_> ngharo, it should work with the default settings though
[11:36:01] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: There was some ruby channel that chastised me a while back. So now I use Python :D
[11:36:03] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: i think because the way you are doing it, it pulls out everything, appends the string then puts it all back
[11:36:17] <ngharo> Sazpaimon_: i'd think so.  You sure you're running defaults?  iirc you can reset to defaults via advanced options
[11:36:35] <rosco_y> eddiemonge: Thanks, I seem to be caught in a rabbit-hole.  Before I can use this I need to learn that, and before I can use that...etc. etc....
[11:36:37] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: thats because ruby sucks. amiright snover
[11:36:44] <Sazpaimon_> ngharo, first time starting IE since I installed the machine, so it must be the default
[11:36:55] <_pr0t0type_> hey what does $() mean vs $(document).  The latter is clear the former not so much
[11:36:57] <eddiemonge> rosco_y: then perhaps you should learn ajax
[11:37:23] <eddiemonge> _pr0t0type_: $() doesnt mean anything really.
[11:37:26] <eddiemonge> ?jquery
[11:37:27] <bot-t> jQuery(selector, [context]): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[11:37:28] <rosco_y> eddiemonge: same question reformatted: should I know javascript to use jQuery?
[11:37:41] <eddiemonge> rosco_y: ideally yes. at least the basics.
[11:37:58] <kenthree> I've got this fairly slow code running on a radio input .change() event. When the user clicks it, the input appears unchecked until the event is finished. How can I get the browser to update the ui THEN run my code?
[11:38:13] <rosco_y> Thanks, I think I have the  basics, at least well enough to read it....
[11:38:20] <_pr0t0type_> eddiemonge: really?  I thought it was syntactic sugar for $(document), but I was not sure
[11:38:23] <_pr0t0type_> which is why I asked
[11:38:32] <karanlyons> Here's the demo: http://jsfiddle.net/8KwG5/
[11:38:38] <eddiemonge> kenthree: optimize your code. or do $(this).prop('checked', true)
[11:38:54] <eddiemonge> _pr0t0type_: try it. open chrome's console and type $()
[11:39:03] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: you cant use append?
[11:39:14] <_pr0t0type_> yeah, just did
[11:39:16] <isleshocky77> I have a plugin built which excepts options and adds a click event to an element. But when the click happens the overridden options are no longer set. Any ideas?
[11:39:18] <_pr0t0type_> it's just an empty array
[11:39:20] <_pr0t0type_> thanks
[11:39:35] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: did you see my message?
[11:39:56] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: It's part of a browser extension, so some things are locked down, but I bet I can hack through the stuff that I need.
[11:39:57] <eddiemonge> isleshocky77: code?
[11:40:13] <karanlyons> Some stuff doesn't run when appended, for odd reasons. But I bet I can figure out a hack for it.
[11:40:17] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: if thats the extension is doing it thats a horrible extension to use
[11:40:30] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: what stuff doesnt run?
[11:40:46] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: Safari extensions FTW. I lost four hours today because Safari silently removes custom attributes from event messages.
[11:41:16] <karanlyons> And sometimes appending javascript doesn't actually lead it to run in the document's scope.
[11:42:02] <eddiemonge> plugin writing just seems fill of headaches. thats why i dont do it
[11:42:02] <isleshocky77> http://pastebin.com/Bt2ZgBsX and it's use: http://pastebin.com/ZWdVgAT2
[11:42:17] <isleshocky77> eddiemonge: See previous msg
[11:42:17] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: Yeah, it's pretty rough.
[11:42:29] <isleshocky77> eddiemonge: So the highlighted line in the second paste is getting lost.
[11:45:12] <eddiemonge> ugh why do people continue to use crappy code sites like pastebin instead of jsfiddle ????
[11:45:35] <eddiemonge> isleshocky77: your keys dont need quotes
[11:45:45] <chubz24469> buy pastebin domain, destroy it
[11:46:50] <isleshocky77> eddiemonge: Cause it's bookmarked from when it was effing quick. I'm pissed as to what they've done to it as well chubz24469
[11:47:47] <eddiemonge> isleshocky77: its still useless since the code doesnt work and you have to do 10,000,000 clicks to generate a version of the code
[11:47:55] <Know1edge> whats the best way to capture double digit chars on keydown?
[11:47:57] <Know1edge> ie 22 isntead of 2
[11:48:55] <isleshocky77> eddiemonge: Thanks for the not quoting the keys, but that won't fix my problems. Anything else?
[11:50:30] <eddiemonge> isleshocky77: i didnt look too closely, sorry
[11:51:03] <isleshocky77> Is there an example somewhere of having overriable options which live with the instance for an onClick?
[11:51:19] <isleshocky77> Or do I have to keep those options in data with the clickable object?
[11:53:53] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: The way I am doing this more trouble than its worth, do you have a tutorial to the accepted way to create forms with MySQL and PHP? Me using .load() and querying the DB over and over again is stupid
[11:55:16] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: you could use templates
[11:56:40] <Sean-Der> Does jQuery have an accepted repository?
[12:00:35] <karanlyons> eddiemonge: I figured out a way. I appendChild() an element, but use innerHTML manipulation to fill it. This makes Safari and jQuery happy. Thanks for your help!
[12:01:10] <rod> Hello! I feel like this might be a silly question but where can I find a list of possible functions I could call once I access a div with $("#myDivName)  ?
[12:03:49] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: accepted repo?
[12:04:09] <eddiemonge> karanlyons: why not just use see ? append
[12:04:10] <bot-t> karanlyons, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[12:04:32] <Sean-Der> Or do you know of a good template or a place to look for them? I am confused when you say template
[12:04:35] <eddiemonge> rod:  http://api.jquery.com

[12:12:59] <DevBrPb> i'm use jqgrid with zend framework,
[12:13:40] <DevBrPb> i'v problem with my ajax, don't return words with acentuation
[12:13:46] <DevBrPb> acentuaÃ§Ã£o
[12:14:15] <eddiemonge> sounds like an encoding issue
[12:14:28] <eddiemonge> are they returned correctly in the data?

[12:21:57] <ryanneufeld> hey guys I need to do a JSONP callback but the URL is restful and not GET friendly
[12:22:18] <ryanneufeld> how can I have jquery add callback/? instead of callback=? ?
[12:22:26] <eddiemonge> phlp: it would be hotter if i went outside ;)
[12:26:31] <Sean-Der> eddiemonge: Sorry to bother you, but the only way I know how to take MySQL and take it to a form is this http://pastebin.com/kXw7E6gW what is the jQuery way of doing this?
[12:26:42] <ngharo> ryanneufeld: doesn't jquery just do a replace of '?' in the url option of ajax?
[12:26:43] <Sean-Der> Just a link or book will do, but I am lost
[12:26:57] <ryanneufeld> no
[12:27:04] <ryanneufeld> it adds callback=?
[12:27:10] <ryanneufeld> and replaces the ? with your function
[12:29:10] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: the jquery way (besides doing it that way, which is fine) is to have the server return json data of what you want and then use jquery/js to format it and then display that formatted text (what is known as using a template, even if its basic formatting)
[12:31:31] <Sean-Der> eddiemogne: Is my way really fine? I am willing to relearn, but if I am doing it right I don't want to waste my time. I just am worried about how I am going to work with taking a third field and putting it to a text field that changes(.change and .val)
[12:33:58] <bob_f> Hey guys, is there a jquery plugin in existence that would allow me to mimic youtube's expandable/collapsable description text they have below each video ?
[12:34:21] <geekbuntu> Sean-Der, that's how everyone does it ;-)
[12:34:27] <bob_f> i.e. I have a big chunk of text and want to automatically shorten it to a certain length, but allow viewing the full text by clicking a button.
[12:34:51] <Ogredude> I'm planning on having JQuery add and remove some fieldsets from a form, based on what's happening on an input field or two.  What's the best way for me to give JQuery access to some HTML partial snippets that I'll want it to use?
[12:34:56] <eddiemonge> bob_f: hide or show or use animation to show only a certain height
[12:35:00] <Sean-Der> geekbuntu: My way or the way eddiemonge told me about?
[12:35:24] <bob_f> eddiemonge: Ah, hum, I was so wrapped up in text I forgot about just limiting on a fixed height. :)
[12:35:33] <bob_f> Thanks for setting me straight.
[12:36:13] <geekbuntu> Sean-Der, whoever ways is this => http://pastebin.com/kXw7E6gW
[12:37:22] <Sean-Der> geekbuntu: That gives me a PHP table. I am caught in that I want a text field next to it when you make a different selection it tells you the price
[12:37:36] <Sean-Der> so (.val and .change) how do I get these values
[12:38:00] <Sean-Der> [price] is in the array also and would correspond with the row and/or pordid

[12:41:56] <chovy> eddiemonge: why do you say that?
[12:42:09] <knapper_tech> ie, not pushing elements into one or the other, but merging two assoc arrays of objects?
[12:44:16] <misterm> knapper_tech: JS doesn't really have "associative arrays" per se, do you have two arrays, or two objects?

[12:58:20] <Sean-Der> geekbuntu: How do I get a variable out of the array and work with Javascript?
[12:58:35] <eddiemonge> jedimind: look at browsers specs
[12:59:00] <Sean-Der> I would change a val everytime, but how will i get the prices and products to match up
[12:59:02] <jedimind> i meant with javascript...
[12:59:17] <jedimind> or jquery, or even modernizer
[12:59:51] <eddiemonge> jedimind: if its jquery then it supports pretty much all of them, either natively or with sizzle
[13:00:02] <eddiemonge> jedimind: so im not sure what your question is
[13:00:06] <jedimind> ...
[13:00:22] <jedimind> my question is how to use javascript to see if a browser supports a specific pseudo selector or attribute
[13:00:27] <eddiemonge> jedimind: are you asking how it does that? if so, then look at the code for sizzle. it feature detects, not browser detects
[13:00:31] <jedimind> so that i can write js helpers for browsers that dont support them
[13:00:53] <jedimind> (css) attribute and pseudo selector
[13:00:53] <eddiemonge> jedimind: why rewrite the code for a wheel when sizzle.js already does it?
[13:00:59] <jedimind> dude
[13:01:03] <gnarf> jedimind: do you have a specific one in mind?
[13:01:11] <jedimind> yes; take a zebra table for example
[13:01:25] <gnarf> you wanna know if browser natively supports :nth-child()
[13:01:30] <jedimind> i want nth-child(2n) ; which most browser support with css
[13:01:37] <jedimind> but then i want to have js add classes, for browsers that dont
[13:01:41] <jedimind> but not ALL browsers, just the ones that dont support it
[13:01:43] <jedimind> as a fallback
[13:02:07] <gnarf> jedimind: pretty simple, style something with :nth-child() in css and see if it has the value u expect
[13:02:20] <gnarf> if it doesn't use sizzle to find the right elems and add the classes
[13:02:47] <jedimind> hrm
[13:03:23] <jedimind> that seems a little backwards, if i change the css for whatever reason, id have to update the check for that css attribute
[13:03:47] <jedimind> im using modernizr to sniff say ... (!Modernizr.input.placeholder) for example
[13:03:56] <jedimind> to build js for browsers that dont support placeholder attribute in inputs
[13:04:04] <Es0teric> atriv -> http://jsfiddle.net/9N7bp/
[13:04:09] <Es0teric> theres your jsfiddle file
[13:04:17] <jedimind> but afaik modernizr doesnt seem to be able to sniff specific support for css attributes/selectors
[13:04:33] <gnarf> jedimind: thats because its not an easy feature test
[13:04:40] <Es0teric> i am trying to do remote autocomplete, atriv
[13:04:43] <jedimind> yeah, i imagine so
[13:05:02] <gnarf> jedimind: the way I said to do it is basically the only way you'll ever detect it
[13:05:26] <gnarf> you can get a bit more intense and actually create the <style> set its .cssText, add an element that matches the test
[13:05:31] <gnarf> check the css value
[13:05:42] <gnarf> and then set some overall support flag
[13:06:09] <jedimind> yeah, thats what im thinking, just create a generic function that would create an arbitrary element, try to apply said attribute/selector, if it doesnt find it, sets it
[13:06:11] <gnarf> and clean all that crap up
[13:06:27] <gnarf> jedimind: you have do it using a <style> tho
[13:06:30] <jedimind> but ... that would be complicated to cover all cases like nth child and :after and :before and ...
[13:06:32] <jedimind> yeah
[13:06:47] <atriv> Es0teric: as i said...i
[13:06:47] <atriv> ve
[13:06:50] <gnarf> :before and :after you'll never fake support for without getting REALLY complicated
[13:06:53] <atriv> never implemented autocomplete
[13:06:55] <gnarf> they aren't psuedo-selectors
[13:06:59] <gnarf> they are pseudo-elements
[13:07:08] <Es0teric> didnt you just say to put it on jsfiddle?, atriv
[13:07:08] <atriv> but it looks like you should check out http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[13:07:11] <Es0teric> =_=
[13:07:13] <tech_help> hi, will this provide 3 links for me?  <li id="4"><a href="#" class="">SUBFOLDER1</a> <a href="#" class="trash"></a> <a href="#" class="edit"></a></li>
[13:07:24] <atriv> Es0teric: no... that was bot-t
[13:07:25] <Es0teric> atriv, i checked that out already... thats why i am here because THAT doesnt work
[13:07:28] <gnarf> but jedimind - you only need to detect the things you are using :)
[13:07:52] <jedimind> yeah but im using quite a few
[13:07:55] <jedimind> enough that doing it manually is tedious
[13:07:58] <jedimind> for each case
[13:08:17] <jedimind> though now that im reading documentation, looks like Modernizr might be able to sniff support for @font-face which is my most important one right now
[13:08:20] <jedimind> the rest i can work out
[13:08:24] <gnarf> then who cares if those old ass browsers care?
[13:08:45] <jedimind> well my browser matrix includes IE7 and FF3
[13:08:54] <jedimind> FF3.0 for example, doesnt have @font-face support
[13:09:01] <gnarf> jedimind: then let ie7 and ff3 have degraded content
[13:09:04] <atriv> Es0teric: are you sure you're returning valid json?
[13:09:04] <jedimind> and while i have a fallback font, i have to adjust its size
[13:09:04] <gnarf> no big deal
[13:09:06] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, have you worked with autocomplete before?
[13:09:09] <jedimind> because it causes an ugly overflow
[13:09:20] <Es0teric> atriv, yes i am sure...
[13:09:32] <Es0teric> atriv -> http://pastie.org/private/3j2brclev5ukhizfsvna
[13:09:34] <jedimind> anyway i just thought it was an interesting thing to solve in general :)
[13:09:37] <Es0teric> thats the entire code
[13:09:58] <gnarf> thats not valid jso
[13:10:11] <gnarf> or at least not what you think it is
[13:10:14] <gnarf> prolly is valid json
[13:10:24] <gnarf> but you're double encoding your values Es0teric
[13:10:32] <Es0teric> gnarf, then whats valid json?
[13:10:32] <gnarf> what is the OUTPUT of that php file
[13:10:38] <atriv> i don't know php, sorry
[13:10:57] <Es0teric> gnarf, i guess the output is nothing...
[13:11:04] <Es0teric> i can print_r() the values real quick
[13:11:18] <atriv> if the output is nothing then you're not returning valid json :P
[13:11:19] <gnarf> Es0teric: that php is just plain buggy
[13:11:44] <jedimind> awesome, Modernizr to the rescue:  if (!Modernizr.fontface) { $('html').addClass('faceless'); }
[13:11:44] <Es0teric> gnarf, then how would you do it?
[13:11:58] <gnarf> Es0teric: $output = array(); foreach($search_tags as $tag) $output[] = $tag; echo json_encode($tag);
[13:12:05] <gnarf> Es0teric: $output = array(); foreach($search_tags as $tag) $output[] = $tag; echo json_encode($output);
[13:12:06] <gnarf> srt
[13:12:55] <josePhoenix> Hell all
[13:12:58] <josePhoenix> ... hello*
[13:14:14] <gnarf> Es0teric: you're currently doing a foreach and returning / echoing? its just strange, build up an array of data and send the encoded values
[13:14:19] <josePhoenix> How can I get the full width of an element in pixels? jQuery.outerWidth is returning a value that's about 30px too low and I can't figure out why
[13:14:27] <crankharder> animate({'background-color': 'transparent'}) actually animates to rgb(255,255,255) and not transparency -- is there a correct way to do that?
[13:15:05] <gnarf> josePhoenix: outerWidth will report width padding + border + margin
[13:15:39] <gnarf> josePhoenix: if for some reason it isn't giving you the value you expect, its probably because the element is not as wide as you think it is
[13:15:47] <gnarf> and just overflowing its content
[13:16:13] <josePhoenix> hmm
[13:16:19] <Es0teric> gnarf, you mean like this -> http://pastie.org/private/3j2brclev5ukhizfsvna ?
[13:16:42] <gnarf> Es0teric: no
[13:17:12] <gnarf> after the loop, echo json_encode($output)
[13:17:22] <gnarf> get rid of the pointless json_encode
[13:17:26] <gnarf> inside the loop
[13:18:02] <gnarf> Es0teric: and next time you need help with 101 level php, try ##php
[13:18:21] <josePhoenix> gnarf: I tried setting a width on the element in CSS and then doing overflow: hidden but didn't see any change :\
[13:18:43] <gnarf> josePhoenix: gonna have to reproduce this in a fiddle for me to understand your problem most likely
[13:18:45] <gnarf> see ?p
[13:18:45] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:19:40] <Es0teric> gnarf, thats great
[13:19:41] <josePhoenix> Okay, let me see if I can't puzzle it out for a bit
[13:19:47] <Es0teric> but... it still is not working
[13:21:05] <Sean-Der> Sorry to repeat my question, but does anyone know a good way to have this array that also contains prices would work to display them?
[13:21:06] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/kXw7E6gW
[13:21:12] <gnarf> Es0teric: and what is the php script returning?
[13:21:31] <Es0teric> gnarf, it should be returning the array values from the database
[13:21:41] <gnarf> well no shit
[13:21:48] <gnarf> what IS it returning
[13:21:58] <Es0teric> i'll find out
[13:22:06] * gnarf bonks Es0teric on the head
[13:22:32] <Es0teric> gnarf, its not returning anything..
[13:22:40] <gnarf> Es0teric: then a) something is wrong with your query
[13:22:42] <Es0teric> i did a print_r() on the $output and it has nothing
[13:22:51] <Es0teric> gnarf, there is nothing wrong with my query
[13:23:04] <gnarf> i'll bet you 25$ paypal
[13:23:10] <Es0teric> gnarf, -> http://pastie.org/private/3j2brclev5ukhizfsvna
[13:23:23] <Es0teric> line 19 works
[13:23:26] <Es0teric> if i uncomment it
[13:23:58] <gnarf> i assume your json.php is not the one in that paste still correct?
[13:24:32] <Es0teric> no, let me repaste that.. =_=
[13:25:12] <Es0teric> gnarf -> http://pastie.org/private/3j2brclev5ukhizfsvna
[13:25:16] <Es0teric> now thats the same as my json.php
[13:25:26] <gnarf> Es0teric: also, i must once again point out, we are a jquery support channel, not a php can't get my data out of my wpdb correctly support channel. :)
[13:25:36] <gnarf> Es0teric: so what is $search_tags containing?
[13:26:02] <gnarf> i'm assuming nothing if your json.php outpus nothing
[13:26:05] <Es0teric> $search_tags contains terms from the $wpdb
[13:26:23] <gnarf> I think you're lying about your json.php returning "nothing" too
[13:26:23] <josePhoenix> gnarf: does document.ready fire before or after all images are loaded?
[13:26:29] <gnarf> it should at least return []
[13:26:58] <gnarf> josePhoenix: before - it fires once DOMContentLoaded
[13:27:09] <josePhoenix> Ahhh that's probably it, then
[13:27:19] <josePhoenix> There's an image inside this element
[13:27:32] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[13:27:32] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() jquery plugin Â— Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[13:28:01] <gnarf> you can link onto the load event of the image instead
[13:28:09] <gnarf> or "also"
[13:28:19] <Es0teric> gnarf, its not returning anything..
[13:28:39] <gnarf> Es0teric: then you have a php problem, not a javascript/jquery problem, and my patience for trying to solve those is <0
[13:28:51] <Es0teric> =_=
[13:29:21] <gnarf> if you just did "echo json_encode(array());
[13:29:25] <gnarf> the output will be []
[13:29:38] <gnarf> so, if you aren't getting that output
[13:29:44] <gnarf> and are getting NO output
[13:29:47] <Es0teric> gnarf, its outputting stuff now
[13:29:54] <gnarf> f'n magic
[13:29:59] <gnarf> what did you change?
[13:30:09] <Es0teric> only because i put it in the functions.php file
[13:30:13] <Es0teric> not the lib
[13:30:24] <gnarf> well then you probably need to include something
[13:30:27] <gnarf> to get that function
[13:30:29] <gnarf> and its erroring
[13:30:34] <gnarf> which is why its returnining nothing
[13:30:45] <gnarf> again
[13:30:47] <gnarf> NOT PHP SUPPORT
[13:31:15] <Es0teric> its not erroring...
[13:31:18] <Es0teric> its just not returning nothing
[13:31:22] <Es0teric> if it was an error, i would get a notice
[13:31:34] * gnarf plugs ears and starts humming
[13:32:16] <josePhoenix> gnarf: I don't quite understand the usage of the gist you linked.. the example in the first line is $("img.photo", this). What's the 'this'?
[13:32:45] <madprops> how can i tackle this, i want to fill a div with posts of different sizes i dont want it to overflow the div, so i want to place posts until there is no space, or if the next post will overflow the div
[13:33:16] <gnarf> josePhoenix: thats just a way to do $(this).find("img.photo")
[13:33:29] <gnarf> ?jQuery(selector, context)
[13:33:29] <bot-t> jQuery(selector, [context]): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:33:45] <josePhoenix> okay. Hm.
[13:33:49] <josePhoenix> well then this should work :\
[13:34:19] <gnarf> are you calling the .imagesLoaded on the actual img ?
[13:34:37] <josePhoenix> yeah
[13:34:40] <gnarf> ?p ?
[13:34:40] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:35:37] <kenthree> any shortcut to determine if 2 arrays have at least 1 common value?
[13:36:04] <gnarf> kenthree: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885557/simplest-code-for-array-intersection-in-javascript
[13:36:40] <gnarf> something along those lines might help
[13:36:56] <gnarf> but basically you have to each one of the arrays, looking for the index of the value in the second
[13:37:39] <josePhoenix> It just never seems to fire at all. I'll paste it.
[13:37:45] <kenthree> gnarf: I'll just write it myself I think, just need to return true on ===
[13:38:35] <josePhoenix> gnarf: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/449030/
[13:39:26] <gnarf> josePhoenix: and you say thats not working?
[13:39:44] <gnarf> also, are you binding that imagesLoaded inside a dom ready?
[13:39:57] <gnarf> cuz if the dom isn't ready, you wont find any nav#projects img
[13:40:03] <josePhoenix> Oh. I guess that would make sense xD
[13:40:05] <josePhoenix> thanks
[13:40:23] <gnarf> np
[13:42:14] <josePhoenix> hmm... now apparently the width of the content is more than the sum of the elements' outerwidths. mysterious.
[13:42:59] <gnarf> josePhoenix: if you could drop that JS along with a sample nav in a jsfiddle we might be able to help more
[13:43:09] <gnarf> afk a bit
[13:43:15] <josePhoenix> ok, thanks for your help so far
[13:43:30] <josePhoenix> I have a feeling that if I make a test case, the problem will disappear xD
[13:48:40] <gnarf> josePhoenix: thats a good feeling to proove
[13:49:15] <gnarf> josePhoenix: if you can make the problem disappear, then figure out how to make it reappear - you've found the problem
[13:50:40] <datlap> i have a drop down box id_sender with a few values. in my html i have  $("#id_sender").change(function(){ alert('hey!') }); however that doesnt get called when user clicks on the drop down box.any idea?
[13:51:21] <gnarf> it wont get called until you choose a different option
[13:51:49] <gnarf> also, it might be too early to search for #id_sender, is it in a document ready?
[13:53:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[13:53:57] <datlap> i did choose a differnt option
[13:54:00] <ProLoser|Mobile> has anyone here used the anything slider?
[13:54:01] <rosco_y> ProLoser|Mobile: :) howdy
[13:54:38] <eddiemonge> anything slider? as in anything can be a slider? like a marqee tag?
[13:54:55] <ProLoser|Mobile> ummâ€¦ sort of
[13:54:58] <ProLoser|Mobile> but yes
[13:55:38] <datlap> http://dpaste.com/581781/
[13:57:06] <josePhoenix> well so much for that
[13:59:27] <knapper_tech> is it possible to re-write the entire page contents?
[14:00:35] <DRSK> Anyone heard of an jquery irc plugin or something ?
[14:00:45] <gnarf> datlap: it needs to be in a document ready
[14:01:00] <gnarf> DRSK: not possible without serverside components, and it wouldn't be a plugin
[14:01:18] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: do what?
[14:01:20] <gnarf> datlap: the line 24 can be moved up to line 19
[14:01:33] <gnarf> and you can get rid of the extra script tag
[14:01:41] <gnarf> also
[14:01:41] <josePhoenix> Odd. Looks like it needs to be fudged by 10px. Stupid jscrollpane
[14:01:43] <knapper_tech> something like .... oh...  $('html').html(data)
[14:01:52] <gnarf> you might want to think about at least using jQuery 1.5 if not 1.6
[14:02:03] <DRSK> gnarf i was hoping for something that I can install on xampp (win), anything really.. qwebirc and such won't work. Been looking a few hours now, any tip on what I could look into?
[14:02:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> please reserve use to only dire situations: http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
[14:02:06] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: why?
[14:02:24] <knapper_tech> to avoid re-writing some crappy php
[14:02:41] <gnarf> DRSK: just grab like a java client like freenode has on their website
[14:03:05] <DRSK> i've been looking for one of those too, havn't been able to find something that works yet
[14:03:26] <DRSK> But thanks, I'll look again.. really went through java, javascript, ajax and cgi/perl
[14:04:03] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: huh?
[14:04:28] <datlap> gnarf: problem is still there
[14:04:53] <DRSK> gnarf actually freenode uses qwebirc and that seems to be impossible to run on windows/xampp :P but thanks again
[14:05:46] <josePhoenix> (non-.NET) web development on windows is a fool's errand >.>
[14:10:40] <josePhoenix> :[
[14:11:57] <knapper_tech> eddiemonge:   i prefer assembly.  nothing like $JR0a:14
[14:12:21] <knapper_tech> anyway, loading the page naively like this breaks it sense the page won't re-render
[14:12:23] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: i have no idea what you are talking about
[14:12:26] <knapper_tech> ie images don't load
[14:12:31] <josePhoenix> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/2uBby/ I don't know why, but the <ul> is always a few px short of the actual width the <li>s occupy
[14:12:42] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: re-render? images load?
[14:13:20] <gnarf> josePhoenix: might need to add some px for the scrollbars *shrugs*
[14:13:32] <RubyTN> how can I hide all divs onclick when the checkbox has been checked?
[14:14:07] <RubyTN> haide all the divs where it's corresponding checkbox has been checked?
[14:15:00] <eddiemonge> RubyTN: :checked and .hide()
[14:15:39] <atxq> so how can I clearInterval from within a child popup window?
[14:16:57] <RubyTN> eddiemonge:  this is a large list of can chan I use that to see which checkboxes the user has selected, so I can hide all of the ones the user has selected?
[14:16:59] <ryanneufeld> I could use some help with a JSONP request to a restful api that doesn't accept GET parameters
[14:17:16] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/WMNaN/3/
[14:17:45] <RubyTN> eddiemonge:  this is a large list of can  I use that to see which checkboxes the user has selected, so I can hide all of the ones the user has selected?
[14:18:03] <eddiemonge> RubyTN: why dont you try writing some code and then we can help from there
[14:18:08] <knapper_tech> let's say i want to POST to an old-school form page and then have the response get loaded into the page. ie.  i want to do in javascript what html forms do naturally.
[14:18:16] <knapper_tech> if i unbind submit, it will work
[14:18:36] <knapper_tech> i -need- jquery to modify the post information
[14:18:42] <knapper_tech> on the way out
[14:18:52] <knapper_tech> but i'd like the browser to behave normally for the response
[14:18:53] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: mind taking a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/WMNaN/3/ when you have a sec?
[14:19:29] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: are you talking about doing things with ajax?
[14:19:40] <knapper_tech> yes
[14:20:13] <knapper_tech> i want to pose via ajax but i want the response behavior to be non-ajax
[14:20:38] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: The URI you submitted has disallowed characters.  and also jsoncallback should have a value
[14:20:56] <eddiemonge> and you are specifiyin jsonp as false
[14:21:03] <josePhoenix> gnarf: I think it's something else. I tried 16px (width of scrollbar) but it wasn't enough. 20px was, but then when I added a few more list items the problem came back
[14:21:44] <RubyTN> eddiemonge:  here is my gist:  https://gist.github.com/1114766
[14:22:02] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: yes, I am, because if I don't jquery appends ?callback= to the url
[14:22:06] <ryanneufeld> which is wrong for my url
[14:22:23] <ryanneufeld> the url has to be formatted as it is in the fiddle
[14:22:37] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/WMNaN/2/ see here
[14:22:40] <RubyTN> eddiemonge:  when the user clicks the button, I want to hide all of the divs where the checked checkboxes reside
[14:22:40] <ryanneufeld> it works that way
[14:22:42] <eddiemonge> oh is this the REST jsonp thing?
[14:22:45] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:22:47] <ryanneufeld> PITA
[14:23:46] <eddiemonge> RubyTN: you want to hide the divs that are holding the checkboxes? but then you cant check the boxes anymore
[14:24:26] <RubyTN> eddiemonge: right, that's what I need to have done though
[14:25:10] <eddiemonge> RubyTN: paste it to jsfiddle. it looks like it should be ok
[14:25:25] <Ogredude> OK, I've got a textfield that's got the jquery autocomplete widget working on it.  Its source is a Rails controller action that returns a JSON set of matching Companies.  Somewhere along the line, I need to push a "None of these" value into that incoming JSON.  I have no idea how to do that.
[14:27:13] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: when I use the same technique in my chrome extension I only get
[14:27:14] <ryanneufeld> Uncaught ReferenceError: search_callback is not defined
[14:27:16] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: where the response text is
[14:27:30] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: hmm. no idea
[14:27:41] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  Eh?
[14:28:23] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  so the best place to push that value into the JSON is from the Rails side, then?
[14:29:33] <eddiemonge> Ogredude: no, in the js where the response is returned from the server
[14:29:45] <eddiemonge> or when the returned data is marked up
[14:30:15] <Ogredude> I think I understand, let me check something
[14:31:49] <knapper_tech> if a form is posted (vanilla html)  the request just gets loaded back into the page.  how to mimic this in jquery ajax?
[14:32:14] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: .html() with the returned data
[14:32:45] <Ogredude> eddiemonge:  it looks like I can use a function in autocomplete's source option, am I understanding that correctly?
[14:32:59] <knapper_tech> $('html').load('/index.php?test&action=view_event&id='........
[14:33:02] <knapper_tech> is that right?
[14:33:16] <knapper_tech> oh...i get it
[14:33:50] <knapper_tech> one caveat..
[14:33:59] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: look at the last example on see ? ajax.post
[14:34:00] <bot-t> knapper_tech, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:35:46] <netAction> Why does a selection of more than 60000 elements cause a stack overflow? I tried for example: $('span').live('click',function() {});
[14:36:59] <eddiemonge> netAction: wtf are you doing that has 60k elements?
[14:37:37] <netAction> Something like a text processor. Every word has a SPAN. This seems to be normal. Google Docs uses multiple elements per word.
[14:37:55] <netAction> It is a very long text with lots of markup.
[14:38:07] <netAction> http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexueller_Missbrauch_in_der_r%C3%B6misch-katholischen_Kirche
[14:43:28] <knapper_tech> eddiemonge:   not working
[14:44:11] <knapper_tech> $.post(url, data,   function(){   $('html').html(data);   }  );
[14:44:41] <eddiemonge> if you are going to replace the WHOLE page then dont do ajax. its pointless
[14:46:03] <knapper_tech> lol   i was asking for a way around using some old php code
[14:46:11] <knapper_tech> i need to append some variables to a form before sending it
[14:46:16] <knapper_tech> is there a way to do that instead?
[14:46:28] <ch3mical> Word up
[14:47:07] <eddiemonge> knapper_tech: add hidden elements
[14:47:11] <knapper_tech> ie, i'd like &name=mary&foo=bar   to become &name=mary&foo=bar&work=done
[14:47:32] <knapper_tech> lol
[14:47:37] <ch3mical> ...
[14:47:37] <knapper_tech> can't believe i didn't think of that
[15:07:21] <aaairc> Would anyone have any clue why the transition I've set up here:  http://jsfiddle.net/aaairc/mYbGK/4/  .... works in Chrome and Safari but not in FireFox?
[15:07:30] <aaairc> Focus on the irc://irc.freenode.net/#first and irc://irc.freenode.net/#second divs
[15:07:30] <chubz24469> so i have an extremely simple problem. i have this page with a button, and it creates a new window, but i want the button to create another window everytime i press it, how do i go about doing that? http://jsfiddle.net/UvNNF/
[15:07:59] <aaairc> Throughout the whole dev process everything was working with FF, so I was just testing with Safari and Chrome to get them to work, and now that I got them to work... I somehow screwed FF
[15:15:49] <starzero> i am placing a .css call in a for loop and it only applies style to the first div specified by id ... is that normal behavior?
[15:18:07] <yan_nick> Hey guys how can I get a variable's value? I've a function like this: function getVar(name) { return name; } but that's the variable's name and not the value.
[15:18:30] <ejo_> Doesn't jQuery have a method for resetting a form?  I don't see one under http://api.jquery.com/category/forms/
[15:18:48] <alexparker> is there a way to fade font colors on nav items or something? without doing images or layering spans?
[15:20:38] <alexparker> is there a way to fade font colors on nav items or something? without doing images or layering spans?
[15:20:51] <alexparker> is there a way to fade font colors on nav items or something? without doing images or layering spans?
[15:24:16] <ejo_> Oh, ok.  resetting a form is just pure js, no jQuery needed.  The only reason I was asking is that I tried it and nothing happened.  But I'll have to test and make sure I was doing it right.
[15:25:44] <Ogredude> ok, I can't quite figure this out myself.  I'm being handed a JSON object containing Company records. I need to add another Company record to the end.  Example incoming and outgoing JSON at https://gist.github.com/1114867
[15:25:50] <chubz24469> so right now i have a button creating a window, what i want to do is make it so that you can keep pressing the button to create more and more windows. how do i go abouut doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/UvNNF/
[15:25:52] <ejo_> there we go, I forgot I had to get the actual DOM object for the form and reset that, not try to reset a jquery object that held it.  So I should have been doing $('form#foo')[0].reset()
[15:25:54] <Ogredude> Not sure how to manipulate it and get that last item added in there
[15:30:45] <starzero> Ogredude: i believe you would parse the json with parseJSON ... this returns an object ... then add a new object with dot notation
[15:31:00] <starzero> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/736590/how-do-i-add-new-attribute-element-to-json-object-using-javascript
[15:31:10] <Ogredude> starzero:  ok let me go look at that
[15:32:45] <starzero> anyone know why when i call .css on a selector in a loop, it only applies the style to the first element?
[15:34:01] <starzero> nm
[15:34:03] <starzero> answered
[15:34:04] <starzero> http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[15:34:56] <Ogredude> starzero:  ok, where I'm hanging up on that one is that I've got relatively little experience with javascript.
[15:35:50] <starzero> Ogredude: np ... what is the pain point?
[15:36:56] <Ogredude> well, I've got a place where i can actually manipulate the incoming data, it's not even in JSON anymore, but as a Javascript object
[15:37:17] <Ogredude> I don't know how to add a new element to it from there.  Let me see if I can share what's showing up in my js console
[15:37:55] <starzero> ok
[15:39:35] <Ogredude> can't find a way to do it directly.  It comes back in looking like [Object, Object, Object].  Each Object has a down-arrow, I click it and it gives me company: Object and __proto__: Object.  I click the down arrow on Company and it shows me all the fields just like on the example JSON in the gist.
[15:40:11] <starzero> is it an array of objects?
[15:40:13] <Ogredude> so I've got that piece of data.  I need to inject another one of those objects into it, and then I can pass it on down the chain-o-stuff to get processed.
[15:40:14] <Ogredude> yeah
[15:40:22] <Ogredude> well, if [] in javascript signifies an array, yes.
[15:40:53] <Ogredude> so I should be able to data.push something to the end of the array...  it's composing that "something" that I'm having no clue how to do.
[15:41:05] <starzero> ok ... you'll push a new element onto the array with push ... the new element will have an object called company with a property called name whose value is "none of these"
[15:41:23] <starzero> something like company.name = "none of these"
[15:41:35] <Ogredude> okay, that's exactly what I was thinking I needed.  Where can I look up the javascript syntax for getting that done?
[15:41:58] <starzero> hm ... well thats js objects for you ... w3schools?
[15:42:15] <starzero> json is a string notation for a javascript object
[15:43:03] <starzero> hope that helps, i'm out
[15:50:08] <Ogredude> ok it's probably ugly as hell and could be refactored much better, but I've solved it. https://gist.github.com/1114867
[16:11:16] <Ogredude> okay.  I'm inside the autocomplete's select event.  How do I tell it when such-and-such condition is met, DO NOT CHANGE the text the user put in the textfield?
[16:11:57] <rubyruy> is jquery's official thing on github?
[16:12:05] <rubyruy> for submitting patches i mean
[16:16:33] <Ogredude> I'm finding that my level of expertise with Javascript is roughly equivelant to knowing how to say "Hello, good bye, please, thank you," and "where's the bathroom?" in Chinese, and being able to tell when someone is speaking Chinese...  But then being tasked with walking into a restaurant and ordering a turkey club sandwich on rye with extra mustard and no mayo.
[16:16:52] <Ogredude> a restaurant in Beijing
[16:21:35] <Es0teric> can someone tell me why this is returning an 500 internal server error on firebug? -> http://pastie.org/private/3j2brclev5ukhizfsvna
[16:22:46] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  is the url string meant to be split across two lines?
[16:22:56] <madprops> any idea why this is returning 302 http://dpaste.com/581836/   ?
[16:23:19] <Es0teric> ogredude, no its not..
[16:23:47] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  ok, then what do the apache logs say about that 500?
[16:24:37] <Es0teric> ogredude, i am using a MAMP server
[16:25:10] <Ogredude> okay
[16:25:32] <Ogredude> look up where the apache logs are kept in MAMP, and take a peek at the error log.  It'll tell you what failed and why.
[16:25:55] <Ogredude> If you need help interpreting it, do up another pastie with the error messages and we'll take a look
[16:26:29] <Es0teric> alright, ogredude... i'll look at it
[16:29:43] <Es0teric> ogredude -> http://pastebin.com/GiURvCGM
[16:31:39] <fraserkillip> i have two included JS files, how do i call a function in one from the other, it says its not defined
[16:33:10] <fraserkillip> the function im calling is wrapped in $(document).ready(function(){...);
[16:33:42] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  hmmm
[16:34:01] <RobW> http://my.36beta.com/pta/ - hover over "Email" - does anyone have any suggestions on making this "slide in" from the left? I tried setting the width of the ul.nav_list_emails via animate() but can't get it working properly
[16:34:10] <Ogredude> it says that a file doesn't exist, but that's one of the core dirs...  It just started throwing 500's, yeah?
[16:34:22] <RobW> So basically, on hover over "Email", slide in UL from the left.. on hover out, slide back in to hide..
[16:35:41] <fraserkillip> RodW: would sildeToggle() work?
[16:35:55] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  what's in that folder it's talking about?
[16:36:18] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  I can guarantee that it's the PHP throwing the 500, and nothing at all to do with the javascript, though
[16:36:33] <Es0teric> yeah, i just found out its the php
[16:36:33] <Es0teric> lol
[16:37:23] <RobW> fraserkillip: thats for vertical, but I think i found a solution
[16:37:29] <fraserkillip> Oh okay
[16:38:04] <RobW> check now :D
[16:40:00] <fraserkillip> oh thats kinda nice, i like the site though
[16:41:50] <Ogredude> Es0teric:  not sure what's causing the error though. Go look at that folder, see if there's anything suspicious
[16:45:20] <Ogredude> hey is there anywhere that I have access to the text the user put in the textfield, within an autocomplete's select event?
[16:49:26] <fraserkillip> Hey, i have a function in a $(document).ready...   how can i access that file from outside that? like from another script?
[16:49:30] <yan_nick> Hey guys, why doesn't work my setVar function? http://jsbin.com/acuweh/edit
[16:49:59] <fraserkillip> you can't do that like that in short
[16:50:08] <fraserkillip> name is a string
[16:50:26] <yan_nick> fraserkillip: what to do now?
[16:50:56] <fraserkillip> use eval()
[16:51:06] <fraserkillip> yan_nick    http://www.i-marco.nl/weblog/archive/2007/06/14/variable_variables_in_javascri
[16:51:49] <yan_nick> fraserkillip: window[foo] = value
[16:51:54] <fraserkillip> yes
[17:00:12] <gadlol> hi, i have a function where its called every 30secs. in that function i have a hover event for a table. The function adds or removers trs. SO iis it a good solution to recall hover evnet every 30 secs or should i do live or delegate??????
[17:02:46] <datlap> my function(data) is not getting called
[17:02:54] <datlap> do i need to set some flag in simplejson.dumps()?
[17:11:34] <gadlol> Which selector is faster $('table') or $('table#myTable') ??????
[17:12:28] <tbranyen> gadlol: $('#myTable') is the fastest
[17:13:05] <gadlol> without specifing the table before #myTable ???
[17:13:12] <lancerforhire> Hello

[17:14:09] <lancerforhire> $("#posts").append($(response.postbit).hide).fadeIn();

[17:14:27] <lancerforhire> var response = { "postbit" : "<li id=\"post_1\">asdf</li>" };
[17:14:29] <lancerforhire> $("#posts").append($(response.postbit).hide()).fadeIn();
[17:16:24] <lancerforhire> Anyone here? :o
[17:17:28] <lancerforhire> Oh sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/PTXZH/
[17:20:55] <gadlol> lancerforhire: check this http://jsfiddle.net/PTXZH/1/
[17:22:42] <lancerforhire> nothing happens when I run in :?
[17:22:55] <gadlol> wait i am fixing it
[17:22:55] <lancerforhire> it*
[17:24:50] <gadlol> it seems that $(response.postbit).hide(); does not work
[17:25:21] <lancerforhire> http://jsfiddle.net/PTXZH/2/
[17:25:25] <lancerforhire> seems to work
[17:25:34] <lancerforhire> wish there was a cleaner way to do it though :<
[17:31:10] <lancerforhire> thanks! :)
[17:35:29] <Paganini> apologies for being oblivious but what exactly does postbit do? I've never come across it before and it seems from your example that it's just appending html
[17:38:41] <KingDosser> I am trying to ajax upload some files into an iframe. I have a function inside the iframe that does some processing but I am unable to call a function in the parent JS that is in $(document).ready();
[17:39:30] <codecab> KingDosser: ready() is a function, so it has its own scope
[17:39:49] <KingDosser> How do I access the function inside it's scope?
[17:40:51] <kborchers> you shouldn't define your function inside $(document).ready if you need access to it outside
[17:40:55] <codecab> you cant, you have to make it accessible by moving it in the scope you want it to use or in a shared parent scope, which would be window
[17:41:06] <kanzie> Im trying to switch from using datatype xml to datatype jsonp text xml but I get a "Resource interpreted as script but transferred with MIME type text/xml". This breaks code execution. What can I do about this problem?
[17:41:54] <KingDosser> codecab: So $(window).ready() ?
[17:42:07] <kanzie> that warning is ok, but next line shows the error "mydomain.com:1SyntaxError: Parse error"
[17:42:27] <kborchers> ?demo @ kanzie
[17:42:27] <bot-t> kanzie, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:42:47] <codecab> KingDosser: no, simply a var statement outside of the ready() function
[17:43:02] <KingDosser> codecab: How so?
[17:43:48] <codecab> oh, i forgot this is #jquery
[17:44:38] <codecab> well, you can actually use javascript outside of jquery
[17:44:43] <codecab> i know its insane
[17:44:48] <codecab> but true
[17:45:21] <codecab> just try to type some js above the $(document).ready();
[17:45:27] <kanzie> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/KWXFH/ can't really make a live case since the domain Im requesting from is on VPN
[17:46:33] <kanzie> kborchers: the xml validates so I don't understand why jquery fails to parse it
[17:47:58] <aaairc> is there way to make sure if you have three different .animate() functions that are executing... that they all begin executing at the exact same time?
[17:48:02] <madprops> is there a trick to make youtube videos not load incorrectly in chrome?
[17:49:09] <kanzie> this makes no sense to me
[17:49:20] <kanzie> why would it not be able to parse it?
[17:51:33] <kanzie> chrome gives me a little more info: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <"
[17:51:59] <kanzie> how could it be unexpected when I state the return is xml
[17:56:53] <kanzie> can I somehow shape the data before jquery tries to parse it?
[17:58:25] <erichynds> kanzie just set dataType: xml
[17:58:32] <erichynds> no need for jsonp text xml
[17:58:44] <kanzie> erichynds: the server is not on the same domain, hence I need the jsonp
[17:58:59] <erichynds> ah, well its trying to parse the xml as json then
[17:59:02] <erichynds> hence the error
[17:59:10] <erichynds> no way around that unless you return json
[18:00:03] <kanzie> but it should be possible to send xml tooâ€¦ just wonder if I have to wrap the xml in something on the server-side
[18:00:49] <kanzie> erichynds: the jsonp text xml datatype makes it receive it as jsonp, tried to parse it to text and then to xml
[18:00:52] <kanzie> should work wonders
[18:00:58] <erichynds> lol
[18:01:00] <erichynds> no
[18:01:18] <erichynds> i suppose you could pass xml in a json key, then $.parseXML it
[18:01:20] <erichynds> hackery
[18:01:43] <erichynds> jsonp isn't actually an xhr request; it just loads in a script tag and evaluates it
[18:02:23] <erichynds> you may want to look into a proxy, CORS, etc
[18:03:36] <kanzie> I have been using a proxy up until now but it fails to retain session-state so I figured I would try and switch to use jsonp and bypass the extra hurdle of the proxy
[18:08:13] <kanzie> I should be able to wrap the return data which is xml inside a myCallback("<myxml>") somehow
[18:09:34] <erichynds> ?gl
[18:09:35] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[18:12:19] <erichynds> you could return callback({ "xml": "<foo></foo>" });
[18:12:34] <erichynds> then in the success handler, grab the xml via var xml = $.parseXML(response.xml);
[18:14:02] <kanzie> yeah, so pretty much what I just said then :-)
[18:14:30] <erichynds> no, you have to return json with xml as a key
[18:14:33] <erichynds> not straight up xml

[18:32:00] <leP> but how can i .find() the child windows?
[18:32:19] <leP> so if they contain a specific id i want it to close window
[18:35:36] <nickj224> can anyone help me figure out how to do this in raw js? var el = $("input:enabled");
[18:35:48] <nickj224> can't use jq for this task
[18:36:11] <coldhead> ?mdc getelementbytagname
[18:36:12] <bot-t> coldhead, element.getElementsByTagName - MDN Docs - Returns a list of elements with the given tag name . The subtree underneath the specified element is searched, excluding the element itself. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.getElementsByTagName
[18:36:29] <coldhead> then iterate searching for the enabled attribute
[18:36:41] <coldhead> but ugh, just use jQuery
[18:37:15] <nickj224> i need the object to only contain els without the "disabled" attrâ€¦ can't iterate
[18:37:25] <nickj224> sucks
[18:37:35] <dabear> ?
[18:37:40] <dabear> what kinda use case is that?
[18:37:50] <dabear> you can't iterate?
[18:37:52] <dabear> :/
[18:38:01] <nickj224> haha. i know rightâ€¦ very diff to explain
[18:39:02] <madprops> what if two ajax calls are executed at the same time, generating duplicate results since they take the same id references, how could i avoid duplication?
[18:39:05] <dabear> my car doesn't work. I can't get a local person to do it, so I gotta ship it 5000 miles to get some one to fix it
[18:39:08] <dabear> yeaa
[18:39:09] <nickj224> is it possible to create the object with all inputs, and then iterate and remove elems with the disabled attr?
[18:39:40] <nickj224> bottom line, the resulting object needs to be all inputs, minus the disabled ones
[18:39:48] <dabear> nickj224: that is possible
[18:39:55] <dabear> both with and without jquery
[18:40:14] <TonyWanis> Anyone know HTML or php?
[18:40:16] <nickj224> i tried delete inputObj.this inside a for loop
[18:40:19] <nickj224> didn't work

[20:08:10] <bot-t> Sean-Der, You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[20:08:29] <Sean-Der> There is javascript there?

[20:20:37] <Sean-Der> Isn't that just a loop that keeps ++? Where did you get the function from?
[20:21:10] <aca20031> i assume windowHandles is an array  of window objects declared outside of the function

[23:09:17] <m03sizlak> does a jquery ajax 'post' use https if its on a https page?
[23:10:39] <Cork[home]> yes
[23:10:59] <leP> would this work on current document
[23:11:05] <leP> or on all opened child window
[23:11:07] <leP> $('selector').children('.list_others').windowHandles[i].close();
[23:11:11] <Cork[home]> m03sizlak: well its just a wrapper around xmlhttprequest
[23:11:52] <m03sizlak> so yes?
[23:11:52] <Cork[home]> leP: windowHandlers??
[23:12:14] <Cork[home]> m03sizlak: i answered that first :P
[23:12:18] <m03sizlak> ah, i see, thx
[23:15:05] <Cork[home]> leP: just checked, and neither jquery or native js has an array called "windowHandles"
[23:15:23] <Cork[home]> leP: so not sure what your trying to do there
[23:15:26] <leP> Cork[home]  http://pastebin.com/NwybSAkf
[23:15:31] <leP> here
[23:16:30] <Cork[home]> uh...
[23:16:44] <Cork[home]> and what should the jquery selector do?
[23:17:07] <leP> i just need to select the child instead of current
[23:17:21] <leP> because i had document.getElementById earlier
[23:17:49] <leP> if div id=blah, then close child window
[23:17:50] <Cork[home]> leP: but... your trying to access the global variable on the jquery object ??
[23:17:52] <leP> thats what i need to do
[23:18:12] <leP> actually
[23:18:30] <leP> If opened child div=blah, then close child window
[23:19:33] <Cork[home]> leP: could you take it from the start...
[23:19:39] <Cork[home]> you don't make any sence
[23:19:55] <Cork[home]> you have an input field and a button to open windows
[23:20:15] <leP> ok the input field determines which directory you would like to start
[23:20:17] <Cork[home]> and then something triggers closeWindows
[23:20:39] <leP> i got a suffix and a prefix
[23:20:50] <leP> and the number which goes in the middle of the url
[23:20:51] <leP> 001
[23:21:05] <leP> i got an increasement value to the directory so when you click the button
[23:21:46] <leP> automatically opens up the directories every .7ms
[23:21:48] <Cork[home]> leP: but why do you want to spurt hunderds of new tabs?
[23:22:12] <leP> thats the point i dont want to
[23:22:19] <leP> so i want to close the ones that has a specific ID
[23:22:41] <Cork[home]> but its not dom elements, its windows
[23:22:52] <Cork[home]> so you don't really have much use of jquery there
[23:22:58] <leP> do i need dom elements for child?
[23:23:11] <Cork[home]> just catch the return value from window.open
[23:23:25] <Cork[home]> opps you already do
[23:23:55] <Cork[home]> leP: well your working with windows and window handles
[23:24:05] <leP> yeah thats current window yeah?
[23:24:12] <Cork[home]> it has nothing to do with jquery or document.getElementById
[23:24:14] <leP> i need to change that to child
[23:24:39] <Cork[home]> leP: child what?
[23:24:48] <leP> the opened window
[23:24:53] <leP> named as child
[23:24:57] <Cork[home]> but thats the h
[23:25:07] <Cork[home]> thats what you already have in the array
[23:25:08] <leP> yeah
[23:25:27] <Cork[home]> you want to grab content from the tab, is that it?
[23:25:33] <leP> so each time h opens i want this to happen $('selector').children('.list_others')windowHandles[i].close();
[23:25:43] <Cork[home]> but....
[23:25:46] <Cork[home]> that makes no sence
[23:25:51] <leP> div id=list_others and close if it does =list_others
[23:26:11] <leP> how do i make it sense then xD i need help
[23:26:21] <leP> what am i doing wrong here
[23:26:29] <Cork[home]> leP: witch of these options do you want to do
[23:26:42] <Cork[home]> 1. open a window, then loop over all the open windows and close specific windows
[23:27:04] <Cork[home]> 2. loop over the windows look for content in the pages, and if a specific content exist close the window
[23:27:26] <Cork[home]> or 3. ??
[23:28:32] <leP> 3 - Through parent window A, hundreds of windows open, When each load search specific element id, if that id exists close that window, if it doesn't exists continue opening hundreds of window
[23:28:51] <Cork[home]> ok
[23:29:03] <Cork[home]> leP: is the sub pages on the same domain?
[23:29:03] <leP> thats all i need xD
[23:29:11] <Cork[home]> thats 2 actually
[23:29:14] <leP> Its on the same domain
[23:29:19] <leP> so it would only be
[23:29:25] <leP> for example
[23:29:30] <leP> http://pok.com/1/games
[23:29:32] <leP> http://pok.com/2/games
[23:29:33] <leP> etc
[23:29:50] <leP> ... until i close parent window
[23:29:58] <vladikoff> pok this!
[23:30:16] <Cork[home]> leP: if($('your selector, windowHandles[i]).length > 0) { windowHandles[i].close() }
[23:30:20] <Cork[home]> something like that
[23:30:38] <Cork[home]> leP: * if($('your selector', windowHandles[i]).length > 0) { windowHandles[i].close() }
[23:31:40] <leP> in your selector i put the div id ?
[23:32:01] <Cork[home]> leP: you put what ever you want to select on the page of that window
[23:32:14] <leP> ok let me try
[23:32:21] <Cork[home]> wait a min
[23:32:44] <Cork[home]> leP: forgot to grab its document
[23:32:49] <Cork[home]> leP: if($('your selector', windowHandles[i].contentDocument).length > 0) { windowHandles[i].close() }
[23:34:39] <leP> Cork[home] doesn't seem to work
[23:34:59] <Cork[home]> even with contentDocument?
[23:35:11] <leP> yeah
[23:35:28] <Cork[home]> ok, have to make sure what name the document has in the window handle
[23:35:29] <Cork[home]> one min
[23:35:33] <leP> http://pastebin.com/0sgyZKh4
[23:35:48] <Cork[home]> dead code doesn't help me
[23:35:57] <leP> xD
[23:36:00] <Cork[home]> ?p
[23:36:01] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:36:06] <Cork[home]> use those instead
[23:36:18] <Cork[home]> if you want to do something, then the code can actually be run
[23:38:20] <Cork[home]> ah
[23:38:34] <Cork[home]> window.open doesn't return the same type of handle as iframe
[23:38:50] <leP> hmm
[23:38:50] <Cork[home]> leP: try if($('your selector', windowHandles[i].document).length > 0) { windowHandles[i].close() }
[23:40:24] <leP> nope
[23:41:40] <Cork[home]> bah...
[23:41:44] * Cork[home] builds a complete test
[23:41:52] <leP> lol
[23:42:05] <leP> I friend of mine said, your working on current window
[23:42:13] <leP> not opened window
[23:42:40] <Cork[home]> leP: not if you work on the value from the returned opener
[23:42:45] <leP> would .children() be any use from jQuery?
[23:42:57] <leP> i got no opener there?
[23:43:13] <Cork[home]> only if you want to look at child elements of a specific dom element
[23:43:22] <leP> yeah
[23:43:23] <Cork[home]> jquery has no handling of windows
[23:43:27] <leP> so you know how each window opens up
[23:43:44] <leP> i want to specifically get element ID, (div or class id) from the opened window
[23:44:01] <Cork[home]> ya and if you write the correct selector in the "your selector" paret
[23:44:04] <leP> so if its equal to what i tell it to, then close that window
[23:44:04] <Cork[home]> *part
[23:44:08] <Cork[home]> thats what you would get
[23:44:16] <Cork[home]> but as i said, give me a min
[23:44:27] <leP> i tried different div and id's
[23:44:28] <leP> doesn't work
[23:53:41] <Cork[home]> leP: http://jsbin.com/anawun/edit
[23:53:43] <Cork[home]> wfm
[23:54:07] <Cork[home]> the problem is in catching when its actually posible to access the document of the wondow
[23:54:09] <Cork[home]> *window
[23:54:38] <Cork[home]> hmm, or might i have made that wrong...
[23:54:40] * Cork[home] tries again
[23:54:47] <leP> hmm
[23:58:23] <rpcesar> anyone up?
[23:58:35] <Cork[home]> ?ask @ rpcesar

[23:58:49] <gnarf> nope, I'm definitely down....
[23:59:16] <rpcesar> I remember reading something about what I believe to be a new feature, but I don't recall the details of it, nor can I find the documentation I remember reading. It had something to do with a change in the event system that allowed events to no longer require a dom element
