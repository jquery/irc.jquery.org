[00:01:09] <berndj> $('foo bar') or $('bar', 'foo') ?
[00:05:42] <Qalqi> ngharo: .find returns an empty array
[00:06:02] <Qalqi> wat could be the problem
[00:06:21] <Xotix> anyone using jcoverflip.js?
[00:07:37] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi: you have a text string that you're trying to search?
[00:09:04] <Qalqi> i have an element and trying to search with its id
[00:09:26] <Qalqi> find searches only strings?
[00:09:31] <Es0teric> from now on, i will be using firefox for all my js debugging… chrome sucks ass
[00:09:48] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi: no, but i thought you asked about some ajax request higher up.
[00:10:14] <Qalqi> i will paste the code
[00:10:26] <Hooloovoo> Es0teric: firefox doesn't even have a js console afaik =P
[00:10:35] <tw2113> not natively
[00:10:39] <Es0teric> Hooloovoo, no but firebug does
[00:10:45] <tw2113> it will though
[00:10:59] <Es0teric> i had some css errors that chrome didnt see
[00:11:01] <tw2113> they're working on native versions of what firebug offers
[00:11:02] <Es0teric> but firefox saw
[00:11:14] <Hooloovoo> Es0teric: i think the same dude made both firebux and chromes debugging tool.
[00:11:22] <tw2113> i imagine it could see it if you tweaked the settings Es0teric
[00:11:36] <Hooloovoo> ummm, the javascript console is not for  incorrect css =P
[00:11:49] <Hooloovoo> i'm surprised you saw it in any
[00:11:52] <Es0teric> tw2113, what kinda crap is that… i have to tweak the settings to see css errors?
[00:11:52] <Qalqi> http://dpaste.com/706676/
[00:12:04] <tw2113> is that really crap?
[00:12:07] <Es0teric> Hooloovoo, i am talking about firebug
[00:12:30] <Hooloovoo> Es0teric: yea, what you're doing there is searching a text string with .find.
[00:12:54] <Es0teric> Hooloovoo, well for my js code, yes… but theres css problems
[00:13:07] <Es0teric> right now data-type doesnt seem to be working for me
[00:13:09] <Hooloovoo> Es0teric: you have to do this. var blah = $("<div>").append(html).find("#eventformid")
[00:13:17] <Hooloovoo> no wait
[00:13:19] <Hooloovoo> not  Es0teric
[00:13:22] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi:
[00:13:24] <Es0teric> -_-
[00:13:53] <Hooloovoo> Es0teric: go with what you prefer, but i promise that the chrome tools doesn't suck tho
[00:13:57] * tw2113 prefers firefox over chrome anyway
[00:13:57] <Hooloovoo> not saying which i prefer
[00:14:09] <tw2113> i'm not afraid :D
[00:14:10] <fatninja> an ajax $.post(); makes the scripts (After posting) to run twice in the $(document).ready() function. wtf?
[00:14:23] <Es0teric> Hooloovoo, chrome tools dont suck but i want a more strict css debugger like firebug
[00:16:08] <Es0teric> wtf? is there any way i can target elements exclusively on firefox?
[00:17:46] <Es0teric> floats obviously work differently in firefox than on chrome
[00:17:47] <Es0teric> -_-
[00:17:49] <Es0teric> awesome
[00:18:16] <mindis|wurk> can't say i've noticed
[00:18:24] <tw2113> they do?
[00:18:58] <Gaia> hey guys, seems like i cant talk in the html channel :< could i aks my question here? O:)
[00:19:14] <Es0teric> tw2113, from what i see, yes they do
[00:19:14] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi: var blah = $("<div>").html(html).find("#eventformid") that's how you wanna do it
[00:19:24] <Hooloovoo> messed up the last one =P
[00:19:32] <Qalqi> ok
[00:19:47] <Qalqi> was breaking my head with the previous one
[00:20:04] <mindis|wurk> Gaia you probably need to be logged in to talk there
[00:20:13] <Gaia> oee
[00:20:17] <tw2113> how so?
[00:20:17] <Gaia> with nameserv you mean?
[00:20:20] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi: if you really wanna do it like that you can look at  the .load() function in jquery too
[00:20:49] <Hooloovoo> i suggest not sending html with ajax cause it has a lot of overhead, but if you really have to you can make it easier  with .load
[00:21:13] <mindis|wurk> Gaia yar
[00:21:24] <Qalqi> hmm
[00:28:34] <juria_roberts> how to get element by name?
[00:28:42] <Eviltwin> Use the attribute selector
[00:30:04] <juria_roberts> if I have a hidden element whose name is xyz how do i get it using attr selector?
[00:30:19] <tw2113> i'm curious how floats are different between Firefox and Chrome still
[00:31:30] <fatninja> can't anyone help me why after I retrieve an ajax post and set the result into a specific div , then the scripts run twice ? If I click on the post again, the scripts run 3 times, and so on. How can that be fixed ?
[00:31:45] <mindis|wurk> juria_roberts i'd just use yourelementtype[name="xyz"]
[00:31:47] <fatninja> and by scripts I mean all the scripts
[00:40:23] <raj> how do I select the <option> with a value of 'abc', within <select class="someclass">
[00:40:26] <raj> ?
[00:40:46] <Eviltwin> Use an attribute selector
[00:40:57] <Eviltwin> select.someclass option[name=abc]
[00:41:14] <raj> just like that with a space?
[00:41:27] <raj> oh, ancestor decendent
[00:41:27] <raj> nice
[00:42:01] <raj> why not > instead of a space?
[00:42:14] <mindis|wurk> selecting value with name?
[00:44:23] <raj> actually, I just wanna add `selected="yes"` to that particular option
[00:45:19] <raj> Eviltwin, does "abc" not need quotes?
[00:45:38] <Eviltwin> It's supposed to have quotes technically but works without
[00:45:54] <raj> what if I want it to be a variable?
[00:46:05] <raj> can I do that?
[00:46:22] * tw2113 is trying to come up with practical uses for data attributes
[00:47:06] <Cork> raj: sure, you just have to concat the string
[00:47:34] <raj> Cork, concat what string?
[00:47:36] <Cork> $('select.someclass option[name="' + variable + '"]')
[00:47:42] <raj> ohh
[00:47:43] <raj> nice
[00:47:44] <grillermo> the e.currentTarget what kind of object does return? i'm trying to figure out how to test if some element is in that 'list'
[00:48:03] <Cork> grillermo: dom object
[00:48:54] <raj> Cork, is it ok if I reverse the dble and single quotes?
[00:49:06] <raj> since i'm used to it that way?
[00:49:43] <grillermo> Cork: ok thanks, i'm converting it to a jquery object because i want to test for some element, whats the best method for this?
[00:51:03] <grillermo> i'm looking for the jquery equivalent of: if object in jquery.object: do something
[00:51:36] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ grillermo
[00:51:37] <bot-t> grillermo, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[00:52:12] <grillermo> bot-t, i know, sooo what would you use
[00:52:14] <bot-t> grillermo, JQuerySprint/dev/irclog - All times are EDT(GMT-4) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/dev/irclog
[00:52:24] <grillermo> oh dumb me
[00:52:25] <grillermo> a bot
[00:53:09] <grillermo> contains()
[00:53:10] <grillermo> cool
[00:53:52] <Hooloovoo> ?botsnack
[00:53:54] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[00:54:33] <Hooloovoo> bot-t: You're almost like a real boy now so there's your snack!
[00:54:34] <bot-t> Hooloovoo, Concentrate and ask again.
[00:58:24] <Qalqi> Hooloovoo: can post requests be done through .load()
[00:58:29] <Qalqi> ?
[01:00:49] <soee> hi, how can i obtain selected list element index (change event is called)
[01:02:22] <grillermo> so, i got this event.currentTarget that returns many dom elements, how do i test if a particular element is in that list at that moment
[01:04:49] <Gaia`> I want to center my div to the middle of the screen from the top and the sides, how?
[01:05:39] <Woet> Gaia`: 1) use google and 2) use the right channel
[01:05:58] <ParadoxQuine> how do i stop event bubbling from events created with on() - i have tried event.stopPropagation and returning false, and neither seem to be working
[01:11:26] <kanzie> I have an application that does ajax-calls for XML on regular intervals. If I don't activate the intervals it is stable in memory. If I activate the intervals each call for 2kb data bumps the memory with about 200kb that never drops down. This seems to be the case even if I disable the success handlers. Does $.ajax() leak memory?
[01:17:19] <beasty> morning all
[01:22:57] <ParadoxQuine> hi beasty
[01:23:17] <ParadoxQuine> any chance you could tell me how to stop event bubbling from events triggered through on()?
[01:23:18] <kanzie> ok, I just loaded 2k data 1000 times over and the tab started out at 50mb, ended at 90mb… all Im doing is loading the URL with $.ajax(), no post-processing and no retaining values. GC kicks in and brings the memory footprint down to 73.5mb, but still
[01:25:17] <ParadoxQuine> and you're sure you aren't saving that data anywhere?
[01:26:47] <Marko> Guys what is difference if I  wrinte parentElement.find("selector) and if I write $( "selector", parentElement)
[01:28:14] <kanzie> ParadoxQuine: yep, pretty sure
[01:28:45] <kanzie> 1110 requests, 451.56KB transferred, memory consumption at start 50.1, when finished after GC kicked in 71.3
[01:28:59] <kanzie> jquery-1.7.1
[01:29:07] <ParadoxQuine> gist the relevant code?
[01:29:11] <ParadoxQuine> ill take a look
[01:29:13] <kanzie> on my way
[01:29:17] <ParadoxQuine> can't promise anything profound though :P
[01:29:33] <kanzie> trying a different approach now where I wait for each call to finish before initiating the newx
[01:32:22] <Xotix>  needa good coverflow plugin. Does someone know one? jcoverflip is outdated, contentflow is strange coded.
[01:38:24] <kanzie> 53.1MB at start… 62.6 finished, 409kb transferred. So it leaks less memory if I let each connection finish before starting a new one and never run them in parallel, however still a lot of retained data if 0.5MB bloats to 10MB
[01:38:52] <kanzie> Ill put a gist up
[01:45:30] <Marko> Guys what is difference if I  wrinte parentElement.find("selector) and if I write $( "selector", parentElement)
[01:46:28] <aaronmcadam> Marko: $( 'selector', 'context' ) calls find anyway
[01:46:35] <aaronmcadam> Marko: so it's faster to use find
[01:46:53] <Marko> is there any time when I want to use $( 'selector, context) ower find?
[01:46:57] <aaronmcadam> nope
[01:46:59] <aaronmcadam> never
[01:47:01] <elfrancesco> hi i am having problem with this code : http://jsfiddle.net/6SUmK/4/ i don't understand how i can pass myImg to my anon function i thought using this would be working but this seems to represent windows...
[01:48:19] <smares> cheers guys, short question... if iterating over a series of dom elements, am I supposed to cache the selection in a variable first for performance or does jQuery do that automatically?
[01:48:34] <tw2113> i'd do the variable
[01:48:39] <smares> I mean, is it fine to use something like $('.products').each(...)?
[01:48:42] <tw2113> better safe than sorry
[01:48:48] <elfrancesco> smares: i would store the jquery object in a variabl
[01:48:58] <smares> or should I do var products = $('.products'); products.each(...)
[01:48:59] <elfrancesco> then iterate on it
[01:49:00] <smares> ok, thanks
[01:49:22] <elfrancesco> you can do $('.products').each() in this case
[01:51:07] <Hooloovoo> Qalqi: yes they can
[01:52:04] <elfrancesco> could someone have a look at my small code at http://jsfiddle.net/6SUmK/4/ please ?
[01:53:14] <Es0teric> ok, i am using .data and data-type on my elements… but for some reason, jquery is just catching ONE eventhough there are more than 6 data-type elements… how do i get jquery to catch all of the elements and return them?
[02:02:12] <Bartzy> Hi
[02:02:23] <Bartzy> How can I know when an iframe (the JS code is inside the iframe) is being focused out ?
[02:02:29] <Bartzy> focusout on document/window/body doesn't work.
[02:02:38] <Bartzy> and 'blur' on window doesn't work on IE <= 8
[02:03:15] <smares> another question guys... let's say I have 2 divs with the class "category" and within those divs I have many divs with the class "product"
[02:04:13] <smares> if I want to get two arrays with those products (so producty by category), I would have to write a nested loop, right?
[02:05:09] <nFFF> elfrancesco
[02:05:11] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/6SUmK/20/
[02:06:40] <elfrancesco> thanks nFFF  i tried it but in fact the first time i used it, it alert 0 ... the second time was ok but i guess there is a loading pb maybe
[02:10:22] <nFFF> elfrancesco, becuase your second function isn't within the img load/
[02:10:44] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/6SUmK/21/
[02:12:28] <elfrancesco> i understand but this time again when i went to the link u gave me, the alert msg was 0
[02:12:59] <greengriminal> Hey anyone is there a possible way of using jquery-ui dialog and jquery-tooltip at the same time. What my scenario is that there is a table with booking inside it and I want the user to have two options either click on a booking and jquery dialog appears or hover over a particular booking and jquery-tooltip/jquery-popup appears. Is this possible?
[02:13:07] <elfrancesco> and if i refresh it say 400
[02:13:58] <ximarin> hi all, question: I have an input or a textarea with a specific id. How can I find out if it's an input or a textarea?
[02:14:20] <ximarin> smth like $("#id").is("input")?

[02:15:53] <xec> greengriminal: i don't see any reason why you can't have a tooltip and a dialog
[02:17:13] <xec> ximarin: that should work
[02:17:21] <greengriminal> bot-t: http://postimage.org/image/mgbvm096t/ If you can try to visualise this table. You have clicked on booking reference number 12345678 and the box appears. However what I am now trying to add to it is jquery-tooltip/jquery-popup so that instead of having to click to view information you can just mover the cursor over it. I am unable to provide a working example as it is embedded into rails

[02:22:17] <nFFF> I dont even see a question...
[02:22:18] <Webb34> IRC
[02:22:30] <Webb34> oh
[02:22:34] <nFFF> are u trolling son?
[02:22:38] <Webb34> lol no
[02:22:46] <Webb34> im just not sure of the etiquette
[02:22:57] <olmnn>  the smell of a troll...
[02:22:58] <Webb34> i wasnt sure if i was in the right room to request help
[02:23:12] <Webb34> but anywho
[02:23:21] <Webb34> my issue is im new to jQuery(obviously)
[02:23:37] <Webb34> im trying to create a tab system for some content
[02:23:53] <Webb34> i found some pluggins but couldnt figure out how to use them
[02:24:05] <Webb34> then tried the simplest one I could find
[02:24:10] <Webb34> still no idea what Im doing
[02:25:12] <Webb34> the site im working on is here
[02:25:13] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[02:25:49] <Webb34> and at this point im going for bare bones
[02:25:55] <Webb34> and trying to get it to do this
[02:25:55] <Webb34> http://papermashup.com/simple-jquery-tabs/
[02:26:28] <Webb34> the site gets some xml after you click "show results" then organizes and displays it
[02:26:50] <Webb34> you can click hospital names and then it should do something with it at the top
[02:27:10] <olmnn> do you know how you want the html to look once you've clicked on a tab?
[02:27:15] <Webb34> but right now I cant figure out how to get the plugin the work with the stuff you get after you click the hospital name
[02:27:54] <Webb34> not sure what ur asking
[02:27:58] <Webb34> sorry
[02:28:03] <Webb34> running on 3 days of no sleep
[02:28:08] <olmnn> alright, I see some text popping up oin the top of the page when I click a hospital
[02:28:13] <Webb34> yea
[02:28:15] <olmnn> do you want that text to pop up somehwere else on the page?
[02:28:21] <olmnn> like right next to the hospital name?
[02:28:21] <Webb34> the ul should be the tab titles
[02:28:32] <Webb34> ?
[02:28:34] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query/js an wonder if there is a way getting to know when $(window).scroll(  ends? is there some kind of callback? maybe someone has a hint for me. thx in advance!
[02:28:37] <Webb34> oh
[02:28:42] <Webb34> no
[02:29:09] <Webb34> the stuff that happens after you clcik the hospital name doesnt happen yet
[02:29:18] <olmnn> whoa I think you just broke my brain
[02:29:44] <Webb34> but ill be getting a bunch of stuff to  throw in  the generated divs inside the #dump div
[02:30:05] <Webb34> i havent queried the database for it yet though
[02:30:14] <Webb34> right now it just throws a "1" in
[02:30:38] <Webb34> i guess to put it simply
[02:30:47] <Webb34> assuming i have a div (#dump)
[02:30:57] <Webb34> with a ul inside
[02:31:07] <Webb34> and several divs inside as well
[02:31:34] <aro> has anyone had issues getting uniformjs to submit properly in IE?
[02:31:43] <Webb34> how can i get a plugin working to make it tabbed with the ul being the tab titles and the several divs being the content for each tab
[02:31:45] <Webb34> ?
[02:32:06] <aro> the ul?
[02:32:08] <aro> or li's
[02:32:14] <Webb34> oh sorry yes
[02:32:21] <Webb34> the li's being the tab titles
[02:32:26] <aro> why dont you use the tab features from jqueryui
[02:32:30] <olmnn> I assume that you mean the list contains the tab buttons and a div right after it being the content container for each tab?
[02:32:31] <Webb34> no idea how
[02:32:39] <Webb34> yea
[02:32:47] <aro> use the tab from jqueryui that will sort you out
[02:32:48] <greengriminal> Is it possible to use the jquery .hover() method with tooltip?
[02:32:56] <Webb34> ok but how is my question
[02:33:05] <mightym> or do i need to use a timer which checks every second if f.e. scrollLeft has changed since last check?
[02:33:08] <aro> did you look at the jqueryui site?
[02:33:13] <Webb34> ye
[02:33:15] <Webb34> yea*
[02:33:20] <aro> whats your question?
[02:33:25] <Webb34> i cant get it working
[02:33:31] <aro> what happens?
[02:33:32] <Webb34> ok, i have an idea
[02:33:36] <aro> define 'not working'
[02:33:49] <Webb34> ill throw it together again(i delted it)

[02:47:01] <Webb34> im just going to college here
[02:47:20] <olleman> yeah, why depressing?
[02:47:22] <Dirkos> why doesnt inArray returns the correct result: check http://jsfiddle.net/ADLNK/1/
[02:47:33] <Dirkos> it says there is an element like that in the array but it returns -1
[02:47:46] <Webb34> rochester = no sun + cold + snow in June
[02:47:58] <Webb34> even this winter was depressing
[02:48:02] <Webb34> there was no snow
[02:48:12] <Webb34> so even the one thingi looked forward to didnt show up
[02:48:18] <aro> lol

[02:49:23] <anticom> hi all, i've got a button in a table cell and the tr's should be counted
[02:49:24] <anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/NDvgj/
[02:49:29] <anticom> what's the most elegant way to do that?
[02:49:35] <Webb34> isnt detroit legendary for its snow?
[02:49:47] <aro> i think motown and rock n roll
[02:49:49] <aro> not snow
[02:49:51] <Webb34> oh
[02:49:55] <Webb34> wtf am i thinking of
[02:49:56] <aro> thats canada
[02:50:00] <aro> the great white north
[02:50:02] <Webb34> rochester is canada
[02:50:09] <aro> i thought it was NY
[02:50:11] <Webb34> seriously
[02:50:13] <greengriminal> Could someone give me a hand please I have the following: http://pastie.org/3430970 which is throwing an error that .tooltip is not a function although I have jquery-1.7.1.min.js included in my assets folder.

[02:50:17] <Webb34> i can see canada from here
[02:50:43] <kcufxde> How to join #android-root channel? It needs registration!
[02:51:25] <Marko> Guys what is difference if I  wrinte parentElement.find("selector) and if I write $( "selector", parentElement)
[02:52:18] <Webb34> ok one more question
[02:52:18] <SugaSlide> $( "selector", parentElement) sets the scope.. i suppose its just prefrences
[02:52:27] <Webb34> i just downloaded jqueryu
[02:52:31] <Webb34> jqueryui*
[02:52:50] <aro> @ anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/NDvgj/3/
[02:52:55] <Webb34> how.... do i.... use it....
[02:53:06] <aro> Webb34: this is where knowledge is power, read the docs :)
[02:53:12] <Dirkos> anyone knows how this is possible? http://jsfiddle.net/ADLNK/1/ seems like to $.inArray isnt working correct?
[02:53:15] <aro> theres a lot of source code you can view
[02:53:41] <anticom> aro what if there are more tables?
[02:54:00] <Webb34> sair enough
[02:54:01] <anticom> oh.. head -> table
[02:54:02] <Webb34> fair*
[02:54:06] <Webb34> ill give it a shot
[02:54:09] <anticom> thanks aro
[02:54:10] <aro> good luck
[02:54:15] <aro> we'll be here :)
[02:54:50] <aro> follow their markup, include the files and themes, and run $(selector).tabs() and you will be good
[02:58:12] <intellilogic> When you say return true;  or  return foo; in any IF statement, it ends the statement?  Kinda like exit?
[03:00:36] <Webb34> @aro!
[03:00:38] <Webb34> it works
[03:00:41] <aro> hooray!
[03:00:43] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[03:00:47] <Webb34> WOOO
[03:00:52] <Webb34> thanks so much dude
[03:01:26] <aro> no problem
[03:01:30] <Webb34> now to make it BEAUTIFUL!
[03:01:34] <aro> :)
[03:03:22] <intellilogic> Can someone answer my noob question:  When you say return true;  or  return foo; in any IF statement, it ends the statement?  Kinda like exit?
[03:03:58] <Webb34> returning something i believe ends the function
[03:04:25] <Webb34> not just the statement
[03:05:19] <mindis|wurk> not necessarily the function. it depends on the context
[03:05:50] <kanzie> ok, I did four tests with $.ajax(), running with plain text and with xml parsing. No other processing of data. One sequence had all requests made with 50ms intervals, the other waited for each request to finish before starting new.
[03:05:57] <kanzie> all started at about 40MB in memory
[03:06:41] <Webb34> @mindis|wurk go on... you've made me curious
[03:06:46] <kanzie> burst requests ended between 80 and 103 MB when total load of data was 3MB
[03:07:00] <jayflux> so i added ajaxStart to a div and now my select inputs stopped working
[03:07:00] <jayflux> http://eltafans.com/3/staff/distributor.php
[03:07:02] <kanzie> that is a leak of 60MB
[03:07:02] <jayflux> anyone know why>
[03:08:15] <mindis|wurk> Webb34 it can also be used to terminate loops
[03:10:06] <Marko> Sugitime: parent.Find als sets scoe (parent object)
[03:11:17] <kanzie> it seems to me that $.ajax() has a pretty big memory-leak even after 1.4.2 (1.5 had ajax() rewritten)
[03:13:38] <clawfire> hi evrybody
[03:14:34] <clawfire> anyone can help me ? my status code functions didn't get the parameters (same as success in success, same as error in error) when i make a $.ajax call
[03:14:38] <clawfire> any idea ?
[03:17:06] <Marko> Guys whys does attr("tagName") return undefined and prop does not http://jsfiddle.net/gzLta/ ?
[03:17:28] <Marko> is tagName considere ad dom propert yi guess?
[03:22:23] <mindis|wurk> there is no attribute called tagName
[03:22:45] <Webb34> huh...
[03:22:51] <Webb34> i got my tab thing working
[03:22:58] <Webb34> but if i try to redo it, it breaks
[03:23:01] <NodeX> prop() is the better way of doing things
[03:23:14] <Webb34> can someone take a look at this and tell me why it breaks?
[03:23:19] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[03:23:30] <Webb34> all you have to do is click "show results"
[03:23:36] <Webb34> then the name of a hospital
[03:23:41] <mindis|wurk> oh dear, asking for people to fix your homework? ;)
[03:23:51] <Webb34> not fix no
[03:23:58] <Webb34> give insight yes
[03:24:02] <Webb34> :D
[03:24:54] <NodeX> what breaks about it ?
[03:25:46] <NodeX> and you dont need " async:true," .. by default it's asyncronous
[03:25:52] <NodeX> thats teh "A" of Ajax!
[03:26:00] <Webb34> ah
[03:26:09] <Webb34> well it breaks if you try and load another hospital
[03:26:17] <Webb34> if you click another name or even the same name
[03:26:19] <Webb34> it breaks
[03:26:29] <kanzie> so, is it just me or is anyone else worried that we have a 1000% memory-leak in $.ajax() when doing xml
[03:26:50] <NodeX> your calls to $("#dump").html() are useless
[03:27:06] <NodeX> $('#dump').html('<ul class="navigation"></ul>'+y).tabs(); will suffice
[03:27:45] <Webb34> oh right
[03:27:49] <Webb34> cause Jquery
[03:28:18] <Webb34> was that the issue?
[03:28:26] <NodeX> no
[03:28:38] <Webb34> ah
[03:28:50] <Webb34> well at least its more efficient
[03:29:34] <NodeX> isn't there an "init" option for tabs() ?
[03:29:46] <NodeX> I don't use them but I recall something like that
[03:29:51] <DreamStiffler> hi i am back with more questions
[03:29:54] <Webb34> i see the words
[03:29:58] <Webb34> and i know them
[03:30:06] <DreamStiffler> who is fammiliar with the iframe scrolling problem in ipad
[03:30:10] <Webb34> but im not comprehending them
[03:30:18] <Webb34> havent slept in a few days
[03:30:25] <Webb34> so lets me read that like 7 more times
[03:30:37] <DreamStiffler> im looking for a sample from jquery if i am able to control iframe via jquery buttons
[03:30:58] <DreamStiffler> because  ipad is not showing the scroll bar...and the two finger method no longer works
[03:31:14] <DreamStiffler> like up and down buttons
[03:31:19] <DreamStiffler> scrolls the iframe
[03:31:29] <Webb34> nope
[03:31:34] <Webb34> still not comprehending it
[03:31:50] <Webb34> what do you mean init "option"
[03:32:32] <DreamStiffler> found this....but dont quite get the demo. http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[03:32:46] <DreamStiffler> i need  the button to be on the main frame
[03:35:23] <NodeX> I don't know about UI Tabs so prolly not the best person to ask about it
[03:36:50] <Thoams> Hi all - having a bit of a php problem. I know, this is #jquery, but... I'm trying to ajax some jq and someone here might be able to help! http://codepad.org/0OJGuhbA
[03:38:47] <Webb34> @NodeX alrighty well thanks anyway
[03:39:37] <NodeX> Thoams: what's the problem
[03:39:41] <aro> Webb34: whats going on now
[03:40:09] <LucaS05> hi
[03:40:20] <LucaS05> someone have used the jScrollPane plugin?
[03:40:27] <Webb34> it breaks if you click on more than one hospital name
[03:40:34] <Webb34> first time it works fine
[03:40:35] <aro> link?
[03:40:46] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[03:40:49] <NodeX> Thoams : try false instead
[03:40:53] <Webb34> but if you click again it breaks
[03:41:24] <aro> thats because you are rebuilding the tabs on the existing tabs
[03:41:38] <NodeX> and secondly .. ".$counter." should be '.$counter.' if yo're eching a PHP variable else your script will be breaking
[03:42:07] <aro> you have a div id="dump"
[03:42:10] <Thoams> I've been buggering about a bit with the quotes and apostrophes, yeah..
[03:42:20] <Thoams> Didn't help.
[03:42:30] <NodeX> you opened with a ' so anythign that escaps will be a '
[03:42:34] <NodeX> escapes *
[03:42:36] <Webb34> ok
[03:42:39] <Thoams> What did you mean 'try false instead', if you don't mind me asking?
[03:42:40] <Webb34> so how should i handle it
[03:42:40] <Webb34> ?
[03:42:46] <knite> what's the best way to select a child element at a known index. e.g., I need to remove an li from a ul, so I can use $('#mylist').eq, nth-child, find, etc.
[03:42:49] <NodeX> instead of 0 use false
[03:43:00] <Thoams> Oh, the... yeah the jquery works fine
[03:43:00] <Webb34> i tried $('#dump').html('');
[03:43:06] <LucaS05> i can't destroy a jscrollpane...the destroy method doesn't work! This is my problem
[03:43:08] <aro> yeah that wont work
[03:43:08] <NodeX> pastebin what the response is
[03:43:11] <Webb34> to reset it but no luck
[03:43:12] <aro> you gotta destroy the instance
[03:43:18] <Thoams> and the response string was originally " ... " with apostrophes throughout the middle
[03:43:24] <Thoams> it's just breaking at that damn comma
[03:43:30] <NodeX> pastebin what the response is
[03:43:32] <Webb34> which instance?
[03:43:45] <aro> ill give you a hint
[03:43:46] <Aamir> Webb34: check ui-tabs class before applying tabs just to make sure tabs already applied and return
[03:43:49] <aro> #dump
[03:43:58] <aro> Aamir: he needs to destroy the instance first
[03:44:11] <Aamir> don't need to :|
[03:44:16] <aro> $('#dump').tabs('destroy');
[03:44:33] <Webb34> OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH
[03:44:36] <aro> Aamir: yes he does, if he wants to create a new instance
[03:44:45] <Webb34> i was totally thinking in another direction
[03:44:50] <Webb34> i see what you mean
[03:44:59] <Aamir> why re-create same thing again?
[03:45:01] <aro> hes loading brand new content via ajax
[03:45:10] <Webb34> im appllying .tabs() to something twice
[03:45:13] <aro> because its not the 'same thing'
[03:45:30] <aro> its a completely new block of content
[03:45:44] <Thoams> the response: http://codepad.org/e1FBYGbh
[03:46:15] <Thoams> the closing script tag is being thrown in where the comma needs to be, breaking my javascript.
[03:46:23] <Aamir> ahh ok aro :)
[03:46:43] <Thoams> because the php concat is apparently broken by the comma.
[03:46:45] <aro> Webb34: working for you now?
[03:47:17] <NodeX> that looks like your App is breaking the output
[03:47:59] <Aamir> Webb34:  you haven't applied destroy method as aro  mentioned
[03:48:21] <NodeX> Thoams: pastebin the bit of PHP that outputs $response
[03:48:40] <Webb34> aro i love you
[03:48:41] <Aamir> Webb34:  replace          $('#dump').tabs();      with  $('#dump').tabs('destroy').tabs();
[03:48:44] <aro> :)
[03:48:47] <marekw2143> hi, I'm developing ASP.NET application, and have custom control which performs AJAX requests to the server - how can I detect when it's request had finished ?
[03:48:55] <Webb34> did i mention i love you?
[03:48:58] <marekw2143> I mean something like "responseEnd" event
[03:48:58] <Webb34> because i love you
[03:49:13] <aro> lol
[03:49:50] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, are we actually encouraging php debugging here now?
[03:50:35] <NodeX> No I was helping someone out why ?
[03:50:43] <Aamir> marekw2143:  there must be a callback method in your .net control
[03:50:48] <Thoams> Well that was a bit rude.
[03:50:55] <NodeX> have you never had a problem that annoyed you and wished someone took the time to put an eye over it
[03:51:02] <marekw2143> Aamir: heh, it's obout's grid control
[03:51:20] <NodeX> Thoams : I would suggest the problem lyes with your App and how it's outputting the jquery
[03:51:27] <Aamir> marekw2143: i'm working on grid view at the moment. hating it :@
[03:51:37] <Thoams> The problem is with PHP apparently breaking the concatenation of my string when it encounters the comma
[03:51:49] <Thoams> cutting my javascript in half and making me sad.
[03:52:00] <Aamir> Thoams:  if you want  a quick and better answer ask in #php
[03:52:16] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, sure but im not gonna ask cooking questions here?
[03:52:21] <Thoams> I'll keep looking... and I am currently, thanks for your help NodeX & you too, Aamir
[03:52:24] <NodeX> Thoams : is it a framework or somehting you are using?
[03:52:49] <Aamir> Thoams:  whats the output of your php ?
[03:52:53] <Thoams> In a way, yeah. This is an ajax response from a wordpress plugin I'm writing.
[03:52:53] <NodeX> it lookes like it's doing (a bad job of) sanatizing your output before it's sent to the browser
[03:52:56] <Fox`> I just noticed a problem the author of this animation has. the animation function doesn't change the 'top' and 'height' css attributes simultaneously, so it makes the animation look jittery. does anyone know the problem or know the solution? http://demo.marcofolio.net/facebook_loader/
[03:53:07] <NodeX> wordpress lol nuff said
[03:53:30] <Thoams> It isn't anything to do with wordpress, and... hell I don't need to justify it. It's work.
[03:53:47] <NodeX> it's certainly not php that is breaking it
[03:53:57] <NodeX> a standard echo() just echo's what you tell it
[03:54:23] <NodeX> however a framework _e() or w/e might be closing the </script> which is breaking it
[03:55:31] <NodeX> perhaps add the opening <script> to another variable and the closing to another variable.. construct your $response then prepend/append the open/close <script> then output it
[03:57:44] <LucaS05> i'm using this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6701970/jquery-jscrollpane-how-to-disable but it doesn't work
[04:00:01] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to query/js an wonder if there is a way getting to know when $(window).scroll(  ends? is there some kind of callback? maybe someone has a hint for me. thx in advance!
[04:00:04] <Aamir> LucaS05: doesn't work?
[04:00:19] <aro> anyone know how to scroll the side content down on a page while the main page scrolls down?
[04:01:19] <Aamir> mightym:  something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1890995/jquery-scroll-to-bottom-of-page-iframe ?
[04:01:39] <xec> aro: you mean "not scroll side content"...?
[04:02:27] <mightym> Aamir: that doesn't help me, i don't want to check if the page ends, i want to check if the user stops scrolling
[04:02:27] <xec> aro: if so, you can just do position: fixed; in css
[04:02:36] <aro> not scroll?
[04:02:45] <LucaS05> Aamir: yes i'm using the same way the destroy method but it gives me jsTest.destroy is not a function
[04:02:49] <aro> i have a side nav, that i want to scroll with the user as he or she scrolsl down the page
[04:03:00] <xec> aro: you just said you wanted everyting on your page to scroll down
[04:03:06] <Aamir> ?scroll @mightym
[04:03:07] <bot-t> mightym, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[04:03:11] <xec> aro: which is the default behavior
[04:03:18] <aro> just the side content
[04:03:35] <aro> <aro> anyone know how to scroll the side content
[04:03:45] <Aamir> aro: like http://demo.marcofolio.net/create_a_sticky_sidebar_or_box/
[04:04:03] <arkascha> Being a jquery newbie I have a problem with an ajax call that doesn't fire:
[04:04:04] <arkascha> http://paste.opensuse.org/61826598
[04:04:13] <arkascha> Maybe someone has a hint for me ?
[04:04:21] <LucaS05> Aamir: i'm using the jscrollpane plugin
[04:04:36] <xec> aro: if you simply want something to stay put while you scroll the page, you can just do position: fixed; in css
[04:04:38] <Aamir> ?demo @LucaS05
[04:04:39] <bot-t> LucaS05, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:05:22] <arkascha> Damn, sorry, the last paste contained an experiment, please take a looke at this one instead:

[04:07:29] <Fox`> you'll notice that at each resize the circle wobbles a bit because it's changing the position too much http://jsfiddle.net/EDLpY/

[04:08:20] <Fox`> if i put it in a table and allow it to be aligned center and valigned middle it looks perfect, but obviously that's not a realistic solution
[04:12:56] <marekw2143> how to select all divs and paragraphs?
[04:13:28] <Aamir> markatto:  $('div, p')  but why you want to do this :|
[04:13:58] <marekw2143> Aamir: thanks
[04:20:35] <Fox`> Anyone know anything about jQuery?
[04:20:55] <arkascha> no.
[04:21:09] <blackspotwiggins> no.
[04:21:14] <SugaSlide> no
[04:21:16] <Fox`> This one might be f
[04:21:18] <Fox`> oops
[04:21:46] <Fox`> This one might be for the level of IRC. Can you not apply an animation to the same element separately but with queuing off?
[04:21:58] <blackspotwiggins> wtf is level of irc?
[04:22:23] <arkascha> wait, wasn't 'jQuery' some sort of java driven polling robot that never worked ?
[04:22:44] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe a sql framework
[04:23:50] <arkascha> ah, now I remember: it was J Lo 's public relatons officer.
[04:26:06] <Fox`> This channel knows less about jQuery than #windows knows about Windows
[04:26:36] <f1f> i thought this was a visual basic q&a channel
[04:26:56] <arkascha> He is true there, but then again #windows doesn't deal with doors, windows and things.
[04:28:19] <xec> i could use some help with things, surely there should be a #things channel for that
[04:28:51] <Fodoj> Hi all.
[04:28:57] <arkascha> Back to my question again: http://paste.opensuse.org/45382317
[04:28:59] <xec> Hi Fodoj.
[04:29:24] <arkascha> Why isn't ajax/add.php called ? but /index.php instead, with the arguments defined in the ajax call ?
[04:29:52] <arkascha> xec: well in germany we have the Auskunft for that, it is a phone information that answers _all_ questions.
[04:30:51] <Fodoj> I need help. I have input with multiple=true, so user can choose multiple files for upload. But when user chooses them and clicks 'ok' I want to create file inputs on page, same number as number of choosed files.
[04:30:54] <Fodoj> Is it possible?
[04:31:07] <Fodoj> File inputs with values of this choosed file
[04:31:27] <Fodoj> So user clicks file input, chooses 5 files, clicks 'ok', then 5 inputs appear with values of this 5 files
[04:33:28] <arkascha> Fodoj: well I am just a newbie, but I dont see such a big problem in this.
[04:33:56] <Fodoj> Problem is that it's impossible to retrieve value of file input.
[04:34:31] <arkascha> ah, you mean you cannot read the value of a multiple select ?
[04:34:40] <Fodoj> multiple _file input_
[04:35:05] <Fodoj> forgot to mention this
[04:35:40] <arkascha> I guess I dont understand, but I thought you want to replace the multi select with 5 input fields each containing a file uri  for later uplaoding ?
[04:36:10] <Fodoj> <input type=file multiple />
[04:36:14] <Fodoj> not multi select.
[04:36:54] <arkascha> ah, so you dont have a predefined list of files you offer but want a standard dialog to search the local disk.
[04:37:01] <arkascha> Sorry, never seen such a widget.
[04:39:19] <clawfire> hi again, anyone for a pb with $.ajax statusCode here ?
[04:39:43] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know of a standalone app  to test ajax calls to wcf?
[04:42:27] <clawfire> hi again, anyone for a pb with $.ajax statusCode here ?
[04:43:19] <Xotix> If i have something like this generated http://pastebin.com/EyVRDrym (note line 10, with the onclick). It creates me several items with each of them got a button. Using onClick, i can just pass the parameter easily. But how would i do it in a jquery style? i need to save the parameter somewhere in dom, don't i?
[04:44:38] <Cork> Xotix: set it as data-id on the element
[04:44:51] <Cork> and access it through $(this).data('id')
[04:45:25] <Xotix> Cork, actually i just cna create a form for each one, since i need a non ajax post call with redirect. Then i don't even need js...hm
[04:45:49] <tomasm-> hi, if i do a $(document).on('click', 'a'), will I get a single item via 'this', or will it be the entire collection that I have to each() over?
[04:46:30] <Cork> tomasm-: the this will be the element clicked on
[04:46:32] <nFFF> ?tias @ Tomas--
[04:46:33] <bot-t> Tomas--, Try It And See
[04:46:40] <Cork> you can only click one element at a time :)
[04:47:33] <tomasm-> i thot so, but firebug seems to indicate otherwise... will look further
[04:48:27] <f1f> it would be pretty dickish if it wasnt the clicked element
[04:48:30] <tomasm-> why would $(this).data('events') be undefined?
[04:48:47] <Cork> cause its not used in jquery 1.7 ?
[04:49:27] <Cork> try $._data(this, 'events')
[04:49:39] <jayflux> tomasm-:  you trying to find a data-events attribute in your html?
[04:50:53] <tomasm-> i'm trying to find any pre-existing custom click handlers for a link, and if so, then dont override it - but if there is no custom handler, then run some custom handler code
[04:51:10] <Cork> tomasm-: try what i gave you
[04:51:24] <Cork> its moved in newer jquery
[04:51:34] <Cork> not sure if it happend in 1.6 or 1.7
[04:52:33] <tomasm-> i swore i used that the other day
[04:52:46] <beasty> hmm anyone aware of a alternative for onbeforeunload() for opera ?
[04:53:06] <Cork> tomasm-: what version of query?
[04:53:59] <tomasm-> well, that works... why the underscore? and why not attach it to the object itself, ie why is it $._data instead of $.fn._data ?
[04:54:24] <Cork> tomasm-: its an internal command to jquery
[04:54:32] <Cork> the events data isn't meant for external use
[04:54:42] <Marko> Guys what is difference if I  wrinte parentElement.find("selector) and if I write $( "selector", parentElement)
[04:55:00] <tomasm-> Cork, so data() still exists for custom uses?
[04:55:16] <Cork> tomasm-: its used for adding data on the element
[04:55:33] <Cork> tomasm-: events is jquery internal, and therefor not added there
[04:56:03] <Cork> tomasm-: though note that events won't ever contain all events bound on an element
[04:56:12] <Cork> tomasm-: only those bound using jquery
[04:56:22] <Cork> onclick or addEventListner won't add then there
[04:56:28] <Cork> (nothing new there though)
[04:56:37] <tomasm-> hmmm, where is this all documented?
[04:56:43] <Cork> they arn't
[04:57:29] <Cork> tomasm-: events is just an array used by bind and trigger so jquery know where to send custom events
[04:57:46] <elfrancesco> hi
[04:58:36] <tomasm-> Cork, so there's all this code scattered on the web talking about getting the event list via data('events') and now it changed and it's not mentioned anywhere? i'd think it should be mentioned somewhere so people don't all keep making the same mistakes
[04:58:38] <elfrancesco> do someone know a cleaner way to retrieve an image (which is not present in the DOM ) width than this way http://jsfiddle.net/6SUmK/23/
[04:59:22] <Cork> tomasm-: the data('events') was reversed enginered just like _data(this, 'events') are
[04:59:34] <arcangelh> Greetings, I am new to jquery
[04:59:35] <Cork> it NEVER was officially supported
[04:59:53] <Cork> and as its internal api, you will have to keep up with its changes
[05:00:11] <Cork> thats the price for using undocumented features
[05:00:26] <arcangelh> en mis aplicaciones siempre veo un pestañeo al cargar
[05:00:37] <arcangelh> I always see in my applications loading a wink
[05:00:39] <Cork> arcangelh: english please
[05:02:10] <tomasm-> Cork, and there's no documented/official way of seeing if an object already has a custom event handler - or to avoid binding a handler if it already has one (custom via bind())? i just want a list of events bound via bind()
[05:02:31] <Cork> tomasm-: no theres not
[05:03:25] <tomasm-> Cork, so this unofficial way is the only way to avoid overriding pre-existing custom handlers?
[05:03:41] <Cork> tomasm-: or keep track of them your self
[05:04:45] <tomasm-> so what is the fundamental difference between $(this).data('events') and $._data(this, 'events') ?
[05:05:09] <Cork> elm.data is a public function for storeing and accessing data
[05:05:25] <Cork> events was put there for some reason even though its internal data
[05:05:28] <arcangelh> for example in the tab
[05:05:48] <tomasm-> so that was a mistake and it was 'fixed' recently?
[05:05:52] <Cork> tomasm-: $._data is jquerys internal data storage, its used by jquery and its plugins
[05:06:10] <Cork> tomasm-: don't think _data existed before
[05:06:14] <arcangelh> first see the list
[05:06:15] <Cork> not sure about that though
[05:06:35] <Cork> tomasm-: but yes
[05:06:36] <tomasm-> so _data() is new
[05:06:51] <xec> arcangelh: what on earth are you on about?
[05:06:53] <Cork> tomasm-: if you didn't know about events beeing in data you could mistakenly overwrite it
[05:07:06] <Cork> and make your bound events all messy
[05:07:51] <tomasm-> makes sense, but it would be nice to have some read-only list of bound events for this very purpose...
[05:08:22] <Cork> javascript doesn't really have readonly as a feature
[05:08:33] <Cork> at least not cross browser
[05:08:52] <Cork> you do have Object.freeze but that wouldn't really work
[05:10:51] <tomasm-> ok well i will make my own wrapper function so I have a standard way of doing this, and only a single point of failure if things change
[05:11:34] <Cork> ?src // For internal use only.
[05:11:35] <bot-t> Line#315 - "// For internal use only." - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#315
[05:11:46] <Cork> hmm thats a different line >_>
[05:12:09] <Cork> ah the sites down -_-
[05:13:06] <tomasm-> well _data() seems to point to jQuery.data(elem, name, data,true)
[05:14:18] <Cork> tomasm-: that doesn't mean that that command is less internal only
[05:14:40] <tomasm-> jQuery.data() is too?
[05:15:31] <Cork> no but the last argument
[05:15:35] <Cork> , true)
[05:15:57] <Cork> thats a private flag
[05:18:57] <tomasm-> well i just want to know IF there are custom event handlers, and if so, which event (click, submit, etc)..... i'd imagine returning a boolean wouldnt risk data/event corruption
[05:19:31] <tomasm-> if I wanted to actually modify them, i'd just unbind() . but i want to just not duplicate handlers in my case
[05:19:39] <Cork> tomasm-: what i meant with private, is theres no garantee it will stay there in future versions
[05:19:56] <Cork> thats mainly why its private
[05:20:01] <Cork> its not an api
[05:22:57] <tomasm-> ok well where can I suggest a feature for a future version?
[05:23:11] <phrearch> hello
[05:24:33] <phrearch> is it possible to have a selector like $('foo > bar > bar') ?
[05:24:44] <phrearch> i mean with multiple child selectors
[05:24:49] <bartmax> yes
[05:25:13] <bartmax> how can i load a partial view and execute the document ready, or is there a live('ready') event ? or something ?
[05:26:08] <MariusKarthaus> Is there anyway to get the widget factory in jquery without loading jquery-ui?
[05:26:39] <sweb> i have an iframe how can i get the jsonp data from it with jquery ?
[05:27:31] <peterschmidler> How do I get the third <div class="text">…</div> on the page?
[05:28:16] <xec> ?slice @ peterschmidler
[05:28:17] <bot-t> peterschmidler, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[05:29:12] <xec> peterschmidler: or actually, seeing as you only want the 3rd, see ?eq
[05:29:12] <bot-t> peterschmidler, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:29:21] <mikaelb> peterschmidler: Or you could use :nth-child() selector pseudo class
[05:29:30] <One-Man-Bucket> hello, any committers to jqueryui-layout plugin here?
[05:30:04] <xec> mikaelb: that would only work if all the div's are siblings, with no other siblings
[05:30:09] <One-Man-Bucket> this jquery commit breaks height calculation in the layout plugin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/80ad14bd14467c547c2867f2677ca581aa29bf33
[05:30:10] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (8m, 2w ago): Add margin after checking width. Add tests. Fixes #9441. Fixes #9300.
[05:30:10] <xec> divs*
[05:30:29] <mikaelb> xec: That's true.
[05:31:17] <mikaelb> Pretty annoing behaviour of nth-last-child/last-child/first-child etc.
[05:35:20] <xec> One-Man-Bucket: maybe try #jquery-dev
[05:35:25] <crocket> Does jQuery replace JSP?
[05:35:38] <xec> JSP = java server pages?
[05:36:17] <crocket> yes
[05:36:23] <xec> then no.
[05:36:42] <sweb> any body have an idea
[05:36:51] <xec> jQuery is javascript. java has little to do with javascript
[05:40:50] <xec> crocket: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200909/java_is_not_javascript/
[05:41:00] <crocket> xec : I know
[05:41:03] <f1f> difference is more fundamental, jsp is backend, js is (mostly) frontend
[05:41:40] <nFFF> Why was it named javascript though
[05:41:43] <nFFF> thats the question
[05:42:05] <xec> it was named LiveScript originally
[05:42:21] <nFFF> Sure, but how did it end up as javascript
[05:42:23] <nFFF> seems odd
[05:42:48] <Kingsy> would something like this --> jQuery('#image_rotate-reel').remove('.jquery-reel-overlay'); <-- work in a .get ajax call?
[05:43:01] <Kingsy> it seems to be doing "nothing" i.e not removing the element
[05:43:19] <nFFF> Kingsy, pretty ambigious question :D
[05:43:33] <Cork> Kingsy: as long as #image-rotate-reel is in the document yes it should work
[05:43:41] <Kingsy> hmmm feck
[05:43:50] <Kingsy> I cant see why its failing then... damn
[05:44:14] <xec> nFFF: something about netscape having some deal with sun about java plugin something something
[05:44:38] <Kingsy> what is the best way of debugging out of a ajax call? console.log() doesnt output
[05:44:51] <peterschmidler> xec:  Thanks for the .eq tip which works fine for me ;)
[05:44:59] <Cork> if console.log doens't output then your call prob doens't happen
[05:45:06] <Cork> Kingsy: your callback that is
[05:45:17] <Kingsy> Cork: well, firebug shows the ajax call
[05:45:37] <Cork> Kingsy: json?
[05:46:04] <nFFF> xec, did you just research that? :P
[05:46:06] <Cork> oh wait you said .get
[05:46:18] <Cork> Kingsy: is your call cross domain?
[05:46:35] <Kingsy> Cork: no
[05:46:50] <Cork> ?p @ Kingsy
[05:46:50] <bot-t> Kingsy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:46:50] <xec> nFFF: no i saw a video of a talk by douglas crockford about it once, quite interesting actually
[05:47:28] <Kingsy> hmm I will take another look and if I cant see anything I will put together a jsfiddle
[05:48:05] <xec> nFFF: but wikipedia has a short description too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History
[05:48:22] <tocka> Hey guys, I have this little line of code, var count = $("#main .grouped").length; what should I do to echo the result?
[05:48:43] <jeffsmykil> Any one have experiencing posting a timespan to a wcf?
[05:48:51] <jeffsmykil> and more specifically the format
[05:48:56] <Cork> tocka: echo where?
[05:49:29] <tocka> Cork my plan is to cound ID's and then do if else with PHP + the result of counted divs
[05:49:42] <Kingsy> Cork: as it turns out, I am using remove() wrong.. for example..  --. jQuery('#image_rotate-reel').remove('div');     <-- that actually removes <div id="#image_rotate-reel"></div>    not its child div..
[05:49:54] <Cork> tocka: you would have to do an ajax call and get/post it to the server then
[05:50:08] <Cork> tocka: php is server code so js can't "echo" to it
[05:50:20] <ecdu> hello! have anybody troubles with jquery-ui draggable offset on ie?
[05:50:37] <Cork> Kingsy: lol ya, totally missed that :/
[05:51:13] <ecdu> when i drag and element, this element is positioned almost 200px over the cursor and the pages scrolls top
[05:51:31] <tocka> Cork, thanks
[05:51:34] <Kingsy> Cork: haha cool.. well cheers anyways
[05:52:02] <ecdu> jquery-ui 1.8.17, jquery 1.6.4
[05:52:42] <tocka> Cork so lets say I need to add different styles to every second DIV lets say 1st => Float left; 2nd => Float right; 3 => Float left... and so on
[05:53:21] <sweb> no one can't help me? how can i get json data from loaded iframe from cross domain ?
[05:53:23] <Cork> tocka: if you already have the divs loaded client side
[05:53:27] <sweb> any standard way ?
[05:53:33] <Cork> tocka: use jquery to add classes to those divs
[05:53:45] <Kingsy> hmm one last thing.. I assumed in order to add an element to another you could use   $('.element').add('<div class="something"></div>); ?
[05:53:55] <Kingsy> doesnt seem to do what I need
[05:53:55] <Cork> tocka: if its not loaded, you can load the divs through ajax, and post the value to the server
[05:54:00] <tocka> Cork I get that, but how to know which div is the 1st and which is the 2nd?
[05:54:02] <Kingsy> well actually it does nothing
[05:54:17] <Kingsy> sorry I missed a ' off that code there, but you get the idea of what I am trying
[05:54:17] <Cork> Kingsy: add adds it to the selector
[05:54:19] <Cork> not to the dom
[05:54:22] <Kingsy> ah
[05:54:25] <Cork> ?.append @ Kingsy
[05:54:25] <bot-t> Kingsy, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[05:54:31] <Kingsy> yeah I figured I was using the wrong method
[05:54:31] <Cork> ?.prepend @ Kingsy
[05:54:32] <bot-t> Kingsy, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[05:54:34] <Kingsy> Cork: thanks man
[05:54:38] <Cork> np
[05:58:20] <tocka> How should I count DIVS and then insert into every second div some style elemnts?
[05:58:23] <tocka> No idea..
[05:59:18] <jeffsmykil> why count them?
[05:59:45] <Haprog> tocka: $('div:odd').css('color','#ff0000')
[05:59:48] <tocka> Because thats the only thing what came to my mind how this thing should work
[05:59:55] <ecdu> have anybody troubles with jquery-ui draggable offset on ie?
[05:59:56] <jeffsmykil> you can use CSS to do it
[06:00:01] <tocka> Haprog Thanks <3
[06:00:13] <Haprog> tocka: or you could just do plain css..
[06:00:15] <jeffsmykil> Haprog: will that work in IE 8 <
[06:00:27] <jeffsmykil> you might want to give those divs an odd class with jquery
[06:00:30] <tocka> Haprog, with css?
[06:00:37] <Haprog> yes, unless you have javascript disabled ofcourse
[06:00:52] <tocka> Could I just PM you about it, because its a jquery channel
[06:00:54] <tocka> :)
[06:00:55] <sviatovigt> hi
[06:01:24] <jeffsmykil> tocka: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[06:01:25] <Haprog> no
[06:01:31] <sviatovigt> I have an onclick event defined on an element in the page, event that calls a function
[06:01:48] <sviatovigt> the problem is that I get an error that the function is not defined
[06:01:54] <sviatovigt> although it is
[06:02:01] <jeffsmykil> sviatovigt: spelling?
[06:02:07] <sviatovigt> nope
[06:02:16] <sviatovigt> I have paid close attention to that
[06:02:17] <jeffsmykil> you super positive?
[06:02:22] <sviatovigt> yes
[06:02:56] <sviatovigt> I have written the name in only one place, copy it and paste it in the other side
[06:03:00] <Haprog> tocka: http://www.philihp.com/blog/2011/css-evenodd-row-selectors-finally/
[06:03:15] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: are there any other error on the page during load?  it could be that you have a problem in your code which halts execution before the function can be defined
[06:03:22] <sviatovigt> no
[06:03:25] <sviatovigt> one more thing
[06:03:41] <sviatovigt> the function is written in an external js file that is loaded in the header
[06:04:08] <sviatovigt> that js file has an $(document).ready(function() {}) declaration
[06:04:09] <Haprog> tocka: the css might not work with some older browsers though. then you could have the jquery as a fallback
[06:04:24] <sviatovigt> and my function is inside the document.ready function
[06:04:29] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: can you type the name of the function in concole and see that it is defined?
[06:04:52] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: or view source of the page, copy the script src attr and paste it into your browser to see if it even loads
[06:06:10] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: oh--you're defining the function inside of jQuery's document ready binding?
[06:06:18] <sviatovigt> yes, the script it gets loaded
[06:06:30] <sviatovigt> JAAulde: yes
[06:06:31] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: you've probably done it such that the function is local tot he scope of the document ready function
[06:06:39] <sviatovigt> ok
[06:06:45] <sviatovigt> it means that's the problem
[06:06:52] <JAAulde> there is probably no reason for it to be inside of document.ready anyway
[06:07:02] <sviatovigt> how can I make it generaly available from that location
[06:07:09] <sviatovigt> ok
[06:07:11] <sviatovigt> thanks
[06:07:31] <JAAulde> but if you must keep it in there, defined it like: window.foo = function(){}
[06:07:44] <JAAulde> or bind it programaticcally instead of in an onclick event (preferred)
[06:08:02] <sviatovigt> I will bind it programatically
[06:08:04] <mantas322> hello
[06:08:18] <sviatovigt> but can you please give me more details about window.foo
[06:08:28] <sviatovigt> so that I will know in the future how to use it?
[06:20:02] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: given a function named foo, being defined inside of another function, with the desire to make it globally available, you can simply define it as `window.foo = function () {};`
[06:20:32] <codart> Hello every 1
[06:20:52] <codart> i have a problem with .next()
[06:20:53] <codart> :(
[06:21:21] <JAAulde> codart: ask
[06:21:41] <codart> yep
[06:21:51] <AdvoWork> If i have multiple elements with the same class, yet different i'ds how can i get those ids? $('.product_priorities').length gives 6, so i've got var count=0; while(count<that lenght) { // need to get the id? }
[06:22:57] <JAAulde> AdvoWork: `var IDs = []; $('.product_priorities').each(function () {IDs.push($(this).attr('id'))});`
[06:23:04] <imc> attr("id")
[06:23:21] <Marko> Guys what is difference if I  wrinte parentElement.find("selector) and if I write $( "selector", parentElement)
[06:23:43] <JAAulde> Marko: no difference, except that the second has slightlty more overhead
[06:23:47] <imc> $.map($('.your_class'), function (elem) { return elem.attr('id'); });
[06:24:05] <Marko> JAAulde:  what do you mean by overhead?
[06:24:06] <Woet> i know it's a long shot, but is someone familiar with a javascript/jquery plugin that allows the user to configure their time and date format in a similar fashion as mac? (see: http://i.imgur.com/MnlJP.png)
[06:24:13] <JAAulde> Marko: givn parentElement represents a jQuery collection, that
[06:24:37] <JAAulde> Marko: the latter has to go through the effort of running the initial function, only to pass it through to find
[06:25:06] <AdvoWork> JAAulde, perfect
[06:25:43] <JAAulde> AdvoWork: Cool. also take a look at .map as suggested by imc
[06:26:37] <sviatovigt> can someone plase help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/CmYmr/2/ ?
[06:27:07] <codart> this.current = this.imgs.first();

[06:27:28] <imc> i've a <div class="ui-dialog .... ">...</div> as for jQuery UI dialog
[06:27:39] <tooter> hey folks, i'm starting dev on an ipad/desktop friendly website and have a few questions, not sure what would be the best channel to thrown them into? :)
[06:28:13] <imc> so I *think* that's an already initialized dialog
[06:28:31] <imc> my problem:
[06:28:35] <JAAulde> ?paste
[06:28:35] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:28:44] <JAAulde> ^^ codart
[06:28:49] <imc> calling .dialog(myoptions) on it the _first_ time, it uses some strange/random options (not myoptions)
[06:29:03] <sviatovigt> JAAulde: have you've seen my question?
[06:29:07] <imc> calling a second time the same thing, it actually do honor myoptions
[06:29:10] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: I see it man
[06:29:11] <imc> any idea?
[06:29:11] <JAAulde> lol
[06:29:27] <imc> i've tried both dialog("option", myoptions) and dialog(myoptions)
[06:29:37] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: what's wrong with `editRecursiveBlock(recursiveBlockId, recursiveBlockId+1);`
[06:29:39] <imc> it's making me mad
[06:29:57] <sviatovigt> there's nothing wrong with it
[06:30:01] <JAAulde> imc: when you run the option method, what happens?
[06:30:18] <imc> JAAulde: the first time, setup dialog with some strange other options
[06:30:22] <imc> the second time, the good ones
[06:30:30] <sviatovigt> I just don't know how to get the next recursive-block
[06:30:48] <JAAulde> imc: so this doesn't work: .dialog("option", myoptions).dialog("open")
[06:31:03] <JCBK> i'm trying to preload CSS images, so they don't flicker when jQuery loads them, which works fine in Firefox. But every time an image gets loaded Chrome still sends a request to the server, which returns a 304, and then it loads it from cache. how can I get Chrome to go straight to cache?
[06:31:10] <shomon> hi, does anyone know a good way of making a password strength indicator?
[06:31:18] <imc> i'm actually doing obj.dialog("option", myoptions); obj.dialog("open") actually
[06:31:30] <imc> remove one "actually" from my sentence
[06:31:40] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: if you are able to compute the unique part of the next ID, use that to make a string represneting the ID and pass it to $() with a leading `#`
[06:31:48] <imc> myoptions has autoOpen: false, of course
[06:31:54] <JAAulde> imc: hmm, ok
[06:32:14] <JAAulde> imc: do you have any idea when this thing is getting dialogged the first time?
[06:32:27] <imc> JAAulde: not exactly
[06:32:46] <imc> well, i've one page where it works like a charm, another one with the problem, i'm investingating the differences
[06:32:50] <JAAulde> imc: ok...can you just use your own element? let that alone knowing that something else is using it?
[06:33:14] <imc> JAAulde: the implementation is exaclty to avoid duplicating dialogs across the application
[06:33:18] <JAAulde> imc: ah, well, yeah--figure out those differences. not sure I can offer much other help without seeing the stuff in action
[06:33:25] <imc> so one unique dialog is rendered on every page
[06:33:33] <imc> and the app just use that one (if not otherwise specified)
[06:33:34] <JAAulde> imc: understood--good practice.  was just checking
[06:33:53] <imc> the thing i'm not sure about
[06:34:05] <imc> i've seen examples where you have a simple <div id=... /> rendered
[06:34:22] <imc> then .html().dialog(options); .dialog("open")
[06:34:43] <imc> the first call to dialog(options) should alter the markup ?
[06:35:08] <imc> i.e. <div id=...> => <div class="ui-dialog ..."><title/><div id=... /></div>
[06:35:09] <imc> >?
[06:35:39] <JAAulde> imc: sorry, you're hurting my brain now
[06:35:43] <JAAulde> :P
[06:36:07] <JAAulde> imc: seriously, though, I don't know how much help I can offer without seeing the implementation
[06:36:14] <imc> ok
[06:37:59] <imc> ok the differences
[06:38:25] <imc> working page : $('#'+ myid).is(':data(dialog)') returns true (before doing the .dialog() stuff)
[06:38:32] <imc> not working page , same thing returns false
[06:38:43] <imc> exaclty same markup, however
[06:39:27] <AdvoWork> I have: <select name="select" class="product_priorities" id="product_priorities_468"><option id="1" selected="selected">1</option> and am doing: var selected_priority_id = $(IDs[count] + ' option:selected').attr("id");  which says undefined, any idea why? the IDs[count] has the correct id
[06:40:31] <sviatovigt> JAAulde: the ids are not consecutive
[06:41:04] <markus_> hy everybody
[06:41:04] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: ok, then order is determined by order in the DOM?
[06:41:10] <xec> AdvoWork: IDs should start with a letter afaik
[06:41:47] <JAAulde> imc: interesting.  I guess you need to grep your source for calls to .dialog() and see which is causing the initial setup
[06:41:58] <AdvoWork> xec, how do you mean?
[06:42:14] <JCBK> why does Chrome do a new GET request to the server every time an image gets loaded again? Firefox doesnt seem to do this.
[06:42:16] <markus_> I need a function to sort a list on my homepage. I understand how the example works. but how would I write that back to the database?
[06:42:25] <sviatovigt> JAAulde: yes
[06:42:31] <imc> JAAulde: ok, thanks for the tip :)
[06:42:37] <imc> getting closer
[06:42:48] <JAAulde> imc: :)
[06:42:52] <imc> now i'm trying to .dialog("option") before doing anything to see how is configured
[06:42:55] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: ok, give me a second
[06:42:59] <imc> maybe i can restrain the grepping thingy
[06:43:15] <JAAulde> imc: aww, grep is your friend! :D
[06:43:19] <AdvoWork> xec, IDs[count] product_priorities_468  which is exactly the same as the actual select id?
[06:43:23] <tocka> Is this a proper way of adding a class? jQuery('div.singlePicture:even').addClass({"myClass yourClass"});
[06:43:28] <imc> indeed
[06:43:33] <imc> git grep is friendlier and faster
[06:43:41] <xec> AdvoWork: but you have <option id="1" ... see http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/core-attributes/id
[06:43:42] <JAAulde> ah
[06:43:50] <JAAulde> tocka: no
[06:44:01] <imc> plain string tocka
[06:44:10] <JAAulde> tocka: adding mucltiple classes with one call just requires a space separated string
[06:44:14] <sjeijk> guys whats a good function to replace a string in multiple paths? In my case i need to change "800x600" into "1024x768" for several images.
[06:44:19] <tooter> anyone know the best way to handle either scrolling divs or iframes on ipad (pre ios 5) - any recommendations
[06:44:34] <xec> AdvoWork: maybe you want value="" instead?
[06:44:50] <tocka> JAAulde but the classes are seperated by a space
[06:45:06] <JAAulde> tocka: yes, and wrapped in an object literal
[06:45:13] <JAAulde> tocka: remove the object literal wrapping
[06:45:30] <JAAulde> tocka:  .addClass({"myClass yourClass"}); should be .addClass("myClass yourClass");
[06:45:46] <tocka> JAAulde ok, thanks
[06:45:54] <JAAulde> tocka: np
[06:46:12] <AdvoWork> xec, but even if i change .attr('id') for val() and have option value="1"  it still says undefined
[06:46:51] <xec> AdvoWork: what does IDs[count] contain?
[06:50:35] <sviatovigt> JAAulde:... can you please help me with that?
[06:50:53] <AdvoWork> xec, here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/hThKc/1/
[06:50:57] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: no offense, but you have to slow down and give me a chance.
[06:51:10] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: I am literally in the middle of working on it
[06:51:42] <sviatovigt> sorry, I thought you forgot about it and I didn't knew what to do, if to wait or move to some other thing
[06:51:45] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/CmYmr/3/
[06:52:23] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: I would do several checks within that function to ensure my regex matched, I found an elmeent, .next(0 found en elmement, etc
[06:52:33] <JAAulde> sviatovigt: but that simple example should get you moving
[06:52:47] <xec> AdvoWork: you need a # prefix to select on ID
[06:52:52] <xec> AdvoWork: http://jsfiddle.net/hThKc/2/
[06:53:29] <sviatovigt> tnaks
[06:53:32] <sviatovigt> thanks
[06:53:41] <AdvoWork> xec, doh, thanks
[06:53:53] <genjin> truble using jquery 1.7.1 change() on a input[type=file], is there a workaround ?
[06:54:29] <genjin> i've seen a patch for 1.4, seems quite different
[06:54:54] <edzjins> hi everyone
[06:55:06] <monad> hi
[06:55:15] <JAAulde> genjin: a workaround for WHAT?
[06:55:28] <tocka> Why cant I add a class? I have no idea :/ http://claughtons.roy-barber.co.uk/privacy/
[06:56:01] <genjin> JAAuide: change() not working with a <input type="file">
[06:56:12] <JAAulde> genjin: it doesn't fire?
[06:56:25] <JAAulde> tocka: thats a whole page...what are we looking for
[06:56:40] <edzjins> got a question regarding iPads etc. well, we all know Google Maps etc. If you open Google Maps with an iPad, you can zoom in and out using the common finger gesture to zoom, but it zooms not the whole page, but just the map area. The same happens on Bing maps. The question - how to specify which area to zoom? This would be really helpful, thanks in advance.
[06:56:41] <AdvoWork> out of interest, is there a duplication check type function available? ie doing:  priorities.push(selected_priority_id);   which may contain values such as 1,2,3,4,4  but i'd want to know that 4 is duplicated?
[06:56:46] <genjin> JAAuide: nope, works with other components on form,
[06:57:12] <imc> edzjins: HTML5 / jquery mobile maybe ?
[06:57:18] <imc> you have events on gestures
[06:57:26] <tocka> JAAulde you are looking for classes called singlePicture, Im trying to add a class to every second class(singlePicture) but for some reason it doesnt work
[06:57:43] <tocka> this is the line that Im using jQuery('div.singlePicture:even').addClass("Hello");
[06:57:44] <imc> maybe there is something simpler, i don't really know the subject well (google Maps)
[06:57:52] <JAAulde> tocka: I se one call to addClass in your source: jQuery('div.singlePicture:even').addClass("Hello");
[06:57:59] <aro> how do you calculate an elements distance from the top of the browser window?
[06:58:06] <edzjins> imc: i'll look over html5/jquery mobilde, thanks. brb when will have some results..
[06:58:13] <JAAulde> tocka: when I run jQuery('div.singlePicture:even') in the console, I get back a collection with a DIV which has the class Hello
[06:58:15] <JAAulde> tocka: so it worked...
[06:58:17] <Aamir> ?offset @aro
[06:58:17] <bot-t> aro, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[06:58:19] <imc> aro: i was use of $obj.offset()
[06:58:36] <imc> and event.pageX / event.pageY (but those two are very deprecated, at least in chrome)
[06:58:40] <aro> ty
[06:58:46] <JAAulde> genjin: I see.  I haven't had that problem, but I have a feeling I will run into it sooon...
[06:58:57] <JAAulde> genjin: is it documented somewhere/
[06:59:04] <imc> pageX / pageY are for mouse position in the window
[06:59:30] <imc> don't know what they're supposed to be replaced with
[06:59:35] <genjin> JAAuide: i've only come across document ion referring to much older versions.
[06:59:44] <xec> AdvoWork: you could use .indexOf on arrays, but not supported in older IE versions
[06:59:48] <JAAulde> genjin: hmm, ok
[06:59:53] <aro> why would $ob.offset() be returning a jquery object?
[07:00:03] <imc> aro: it does not
[07:00:17] <aro> it is for me
[07:00:18] <imc> i think... { top: number, left: number }
[07:00:20] <tocka> JAAulde lol, i was viewing the source and actually looking for it to change :D hah, Thanks!!!!!
[07:00:21] <xec> AdvoWork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[07:00:34] <JAAulde> tocka: HA! glad you figured that out
[07:01:43] <AdvoWork> xec, wouldnt I have to loop through each individual number to check each individual number?
[07:02:30] <xec> ?eval [1,2,3,4].indexOf(4)
[07:02:31] <bot-t> xec: 3
[07:02:52] <imc> aro: i get: Object { top=2237.300048828125, left=0}
[07:02:56] <imc> (as an example)
[07:03:05] <xec> ?eval [1,2,3,4].indexOf(5)
[07:03:06] <bot-t> xec: -1
[07:03:11] <xec> AdvoWork: makes sense?
[07:07:41] <sjeijk> can some1 help me with this? http://pastebin.com/kCVm0QJC

[07:09:51] <Webb34> hey im having a strange issue with my site
[07:10:02] <Webb34> 3 hours of googling has turned up nothing
[07:10:07] <Webb34> im using google's map api
[07:10:24] <Webb34> and its telling me gmap is not a function
[07:10:35] <antdillon> sjeijk, you should should use each
[07:10:40] <xaa> clear
[07:10:55] <codart> some body help me http://jsfiddle.net/F6qhU/1/
[07:11:04] <Webb34> here is my page, if anyone could take a look I would really appreciate it
[07:11:05] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[07:11:14] <blackspotwiggins> oh wow, still asking for homework help
[07:11:23] <sjeijk> ok thanks antdillon, gonna look into that
[07:11:28] <xec> sjeijk: .attr() will return attribute value of *the first* element in the set
[07:11:31] <thang> jquery for homework?
[07:11:32] <antdillon> sjeijk, You are only referencing the first image: http://api.jquery.com/each/
[07:11:40] <imc> had no js/jquery for homework
[07:11:42] <imc> :(
[07:11:51] <blackspotwiggins> google maps api isnt really jquery either
[07:11:57] <imc> would have been more useful than the crappy Java anyway
[07:12:01] <thang> webdev classes make me sad panda
[07:12:22] <Webb34> yup
[07:12:54] <Webb34> honestly at this point its my own curiousity more than homework
[07:13:16] <xec> sjeijk: you should also cache your selector - now you're searching the DOM over and over each time the window is resized
[07:13:25] <LordThumper> codart:
[07:13:39] <LordThumper> var slide = $('#'+sliderID)[0]
[07:14:18] <antdillon> sjeijk, create a variable in the checkWindowSize function that is set to '_assets/images/1600x1200/', etc based on the if statements
[07:14:31] <sjeijk> thanks xec gonna look that up also
[07:15:52] <antdillon> sjeijk, After that do an $("#content_image img").each(function(index) { $(this).attr('src', theVar + $(this).attr("src").split('/')[3] });
[07:16:03] <xec> codart: what is "this" inside your function? are you using it as a constructor?
[07:18:04] <Guddu> Dear alll... Could someone please help me understand a piece of Javascript that powers a point of sales application? I have some doubts regarding how things are working on the UI....To see the UI, please open https://demo.phppointofsale.com/ and click on login and then go to Sales Menu.....Over there when i select a Item from the Search box, I am confused how things work.... Appreciate your help on this.
[07:18:17] <Webb34> my theory is that all the jquery plugins im using(not sure how to phrase it) may be conflicting
[07:18:34] <sjeijk> thanks antdillon, dec working it, keep you posted and thanks
[07:18:40] <sjeijk> xec*
[07:18:46] <Webb34> although its only a few, i feel it may be enough even though im not sure how
[07:19:03] <imc> i've seen a nightmare : jquery.mobile + history.js
[07:19:24] <Webb34> no idea what that means
[07:19:24] <antdillon> sjeijk, no worries, your welcome
[07:19:35] <Webb34> :D
[07:19:48] <imc> both handles html5's onpopstate
[07:20:14] <blackspotwiggins> imc, why would anyone add history.js to jquery mobile?
[07:20:36] <blackspotwiggins> then again, i've seen 2 versions of prototype with 2 versions of jquery on one page as well
[07:21:30] <imc> blackspotwiggins: history.js was already there. jquery.mobile was added.
[07:22:00] <aro> why is it that on page load, my plugin is reporting the offset height to be 0?
[07:22:15] <aro> i have the plugin loading in $(document).ready()
[07:22:37] <xec> Guddu: i doubt anyone is going to dig through the entire site for you, but it looks like a standard jquery ui autocomplete plugin is being used
[07:22:58] <imc> well, for a lot of money i would do it
[07:23:13] <Guddu> xec , Thanks for your response on this. I wanted to know how when i search something in the search box, the automplete shows up a list and when selected, it populates some data in the data grid....Just wondering if you could please guide me atleast to the code....a kind of walk through.... It will help me a lot....I am still learning but I am willling to explore
[07:23:33] <Guddu> xec, I tried finding the javascript code but i could not
[07:23:55] <greengriminal> has anyone here used simpletip
[07:24:09] <blackspotwiggins> ?anyone @ greengriminal
[07:24:10] <bot-t> greengriminal, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[07:24:52] <xec> Guddu: if you use firefox you can use firebug addon to list scripts used
[07:24:58] <Guddu> xec , I almost have a autocomplete working on my Web based Application (with Django as backend)....I was confused more about the part when we select something from Autocomplete list and then something automatically gets populated below
[07:25:31] <jeffsmykil> xec can I get another set of eyes on this?  setTimeout(($("#alertType").val(alertTypeSelected)), 3000);
[07:25:56] <greengriminal> blackspotwiggins: Sorry about that, let me ask again, has anyone used simpletip before? Thank you
[07:26:03] <Webb34> im gonna take bot-t's advice
[07:26:06] * blackspotwiggins facepalms
[07:26:09] <gehsekky> lol
[07:26:10] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: setTimeout( function() {  $("#stuff").whatever();  }, 3000);
[07:26:13] <xec> jeffsmykil: setTimeout(function(){ whatver}, 3000) <-- ?
[07:26:21] <jeffsmykil> ty
[07:26:33] <Webb34> can anyone tell me why the heck im being told gmap isnt a function at http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[07:26:35] <aro> why does $.offset() return 0 on page load? even though it is being called on dom ready?
[07:28:09] <jeffsmykil> argh why wont this select change
[07:28:34] <xec> Guddu: you can do things when something is selected, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ <-- see the events tab
[07:30:12] <AdvoWork> xec, but if im looping through multiple select menu's and getting their priorities, putting them into an object, wouldnt i have to do: eval [1,2,3,4].indexOf(x)  for all priorities (min - max ) for x?
[07:31:14] <Bartzy> Hi,
[07:31:22] <xec> AdvoWork: don't do eval, that was a bot command :P
[07:31:48] <Bartzy> $('.container').is(':visible').fadeOut(300) - that won't work if there is no .container elements visible.
[07:31:51] <Bartzy> How can I make that work ?
[07:31:53] <xec> AdvoWork: my point was that you do not need to loop through an array to see if something exists in it, as this is what indexOf does
[07:31:54] <Bartzy> Without an if ? :\
[07:32:39] <xec> Bartzy: is() returns a boolean, maybe see ?filter
[07:32:40] <bot-t> Bartzy, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[07:32:43] <aro> theres an indian company selling their own ripped off version of jquery
[07:32:50] <aro> i hate offset
[07:33:00] <aro> i wonder how many ppl actually buy it
[07:33:29] <WebDragon> why would people buy it when they could get it free
[07:33:45] <xec> WebDragon: because they don't know they could get it free?
[07:34:09] * WebDragon pushes the gorilla named 'learn to google' out in the middle of the room
[07:34:20] <WebDragon> then they deserve their fate?
[07:34:21] <WebDragon> ;)
[07:35:12] <WebDragon> one should hunt down every one of their clients and offer to switch them to the free version -- for a small fee of course ;)
[07:35:22] <WebDragon> *chuckle*
[07:35:41] <WebDragon> $2.00 ought to cover it
[07:35:54] <Guddu> xec i see $( "#item" ).autocomplete({ in that code on website i mentioned.....Would that be the code driving this?
[07:36:18] <xec> Guddu: it's a start, if item is the id of the searchbox?
[07:37:50] <Guddu> xec That's what i am confused about....ID of search box is reg_item_search but i don't see any mention of this id for Javascript Selection
[07:37:57] <sjeijk> antdillon could you pls look again at this? http://pastebin.com/tJAtxvsb I think there is a typo in it, because it is not working
[07:38:18] <sjeijk> the added code i use is in the top
[07:38:28] <aro> i have this jquery scrolling plugin, but when i scroll to the bottom, it scrolls the content a little bit more down below the fold. How can i prevent that?
[07:39:05] <shomon> hi, does anyone know of a password strength indicator plugin?
[07:39:10] <NodeX> try taking height()-padding
[07:39:29] <NodeX> shomon : give me your password I will indicate if it's strong :P
[07:40:08] <jonclark> is CORS ever possible in IE7?
[07:40:21] <Webb34> can anyone tell me why I am getting "gmap is not a function" on this page? http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[07:40:39] <Webb34> to get to the error you have to click "show results" and then click a hospital's name and it should create a bunch of stuff on the top of the page.
[07:41:57] <aro> NodeX: is that for me
[07:43:35] <Bartzy> Why $(window).blur(function....) doesn't work on IE8 on iframes ?
[07:44:15] <NodeX> the padding thing .. yes
[07:44:29] <NodeX> IE sucks lol
[07:44:36] <aro> its not for ie
[07:44:37] <aro> its chrome
[07:44:45] <NodeX> nothing ever works in ie8,7,9 all the same
[07:44:58] <NodeX> I didn't say it was for ie Aro
[07:45:03] <NodeX> [15:43:33] <Bartzy> Why $(window).blur(function....) doesn't work on IE8 on iframes ?
[07:45:14] <antdillon> sjeijk, there are a few brackets missing, im re-writing it now and send it over
[07:45:37] <Bartzy> NodeX: So how can I make it work
[07:45:53] <sjeijk> thanks a lot antdillon
[07:49:14] <NodeX> are you trying to trigger it on an iframe blur or on the parent top window blur (clicking in the ifraem)
[07:49:16] <NodeX> ?
[07:49:28] <antdillon> sjeijk, http://jsfiddle.net/jBxws/3/
[07:50:04] <sjeijk> <3
[07:50:42] <antdillon> sjeijk, let me know if you have any probs
[07:51:17] <sjeijk> I'm gonna implement it now, will let you know if all works out
[07:51:19] <Guddu> xec, I have read the document but I still could not relate. Could u please help. I See that the search box has this ID .... 			<div id="reg_item_search"> But where is the associates javascript for autoselect and select event handler?
[07:52:18] <xec> Guddu: like i said, i doubt anyone is going to dig through the site for you. if there is something about the autocomplete plugin you need help with, i suggest you create a small demo with your attempt - see ?demo
[07:52:19] <bot-t> Guddu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:53:33] <Guddu> xec, I am not able to create a demo as that's what I am trying to do :) And hence i pointed to the demo website earlier...Hope you would undesrtand.
[07:54:18] <xec> Guddu: hence "attempt" :) pseudocode can help us understand what you're trying to do
[07:54:57] <arcil> i have an handler for my submit form that does some async validation. now i have the problem that i want to submit the form when the async validation is done, but when i call $(form).submit() i get an unwanted recursion. how can i handle this elgantly?
[07:56:16] <Guddu> xec if you could just point me to where that HTML Elemente is getting the Javascript from then I will as well try and build the whole thing. That's what is troubling me at the moment. I have gone through the tutorials but even immmediately after reading them I am anot able to related with what is there on the demo site that i sent.
[07:57:31] <xec> Guddu: i just went back to the site to have a quick look, and the ID for the search box is "item"
[07:59:18] <xec> arcil: you could make (another) ajax http post request with serialized data, rather than doing .submit()
[08:01:13] <Clorith> I've hit a peculiar bug in IE9 (update 9.0.5, works fine in update 9.0.4) with jQueryUI. The datepicker becomes unresponsive after swapping dates twice, no fatal errors, script console is clean
[08:01:17] <Clorith> It's very peculiar
[08:04:06] <MacroMan> Hi all
[08:04:40] <MacroMan> I'm converting some of my old vanilla code over to jquery and I'm stuck on how to achieve something
[08:05:28] <xckpd7> question: I'm trying to unbind a submit from a form... but it has an action on it so it ends up submitting, which I don't want to happen. in addition (or alteration) to doing $('.form').unbind('submit'), is there any easy way of stopping the form from submitting?
[08:05:49] <Guddu> xec, Ok...The id is item...and i see that the autocomplete JS method is called $( "#item" ).autocomplete({ ... over there they have select: function(event, ui) inside which they have $('#add_item_form').ajaxSubmit({target: "#register_container"}); so that one is probbaly the one doing this work.....I will explore more and ask more questions...Thanks for this initial guidance.
[08:05:55] <MacroMan> I have a table that is generated by php. In the each row there is a link that calls a javascript function like so: onclick="myfunction('param_x') where x gets incremented for each row
[08:05:59] <Marcel> Hi, I found a error on website! Who I must talk about it?
[08:06:02] <arcil> xec: i will try it out. thank you
[08:06:05] <Clorith> xckpd7, .preventDefault()
[08:06:17] <Clorith> Or something along those lines, I don't rememebr it 100% in my head, but that'ss a function to stop the default action
[08:06:32] <thang> thats it
[08:06:49] <iamhappy> is this actually a good solution, or can this be done with minimal effort and no plugin? http://papermashup.com/jquery-show-hide-plugin/
[08:06:58] <xrated> MacroMan, why are you generated that in your PHP instead of using JS to binding to the a tag, finding the index of the row and such
[08:07:06] <Marcel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5851
[08:07:27] <iamhappy> I used the plugin, but the problem is that when you click a div that is already shown, it hides and shows itself again instead of just hiding
[08:07:29] <MacroMan> xrated, that's just how I did it orignally
[08:07:36] <Clorith> wasn't .live deprecated ?
[08:07:41] <xrated> Clorith, yes.
[08:07:47] <xrated> use .on now
[08:07:48] <sjeijk> got it almost working antdillon
[08:08:02] <MacroMan> I can change it, I just don't know how
[08:08:10] <Clorith> xrated, just commenting on the bug Marcel posted just now =)
[08:08:12] <antdillon> sjeijk, whats wrong?
[08:08:58] <Marcel> The server has a broken Python package
[08:09:05] <Marcel> Take a look!
[08:09:08] <Marcel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5851
[08:09:23] <xec> iamhappy: i haven't read the entire thing, but it looks like it does pretty much the same as .toggle()
[08:09:47] <sjeijk> it chops of the name and give undefined and there was a ) missing in the each function at the end
[08:10:32] <antdillon> sjeijk, is that the code @ http://jsfiddle.net/jBxws/3/
[08:10:36] <iamhappy> is .toggle() able to make the other divs hide when that specific one is clicked? (yes, I suck at jquery)
[08:11:11] <iamhappy> granted, I know most things can be done, but it is something a novice should take on, I guess would be the more accurate question
[08:11:14] <sjeijk> yes it is
[08:11:15] <xec> iamhappy: you might want the jquery ui accordion ?
[08:11:40] <sjeijk> so i made it into this http://jsfiddle.net/jBxws/5/
[08:11:45] <iamhappy> oh yes.
[08:11:50] <iamhappy> I forgot about jquery UI
[08:12:03] <iamhappy> I'll look into that, thx.
[08:12:04] <NET||abuse> hi guys, building a form validation method to take inline error messages and pass them to a jquery validate showErrors handler, having the weirdest behaviour, from a $(document).ready(functio(){    i call $('#formid').validate().showErrors({'fieldid':'message here'}); then i have   function showErrors_handler(errorMap, errorList){ $.each(errorList, function(index, error){      in this scope error.element is undefined.
[08:13:11] <NET||abuse> then if i change the call in the document.ready  to use setTimeout('$("#formid").validate().showErrors({"fieldid":"message goes here"})', 1);  it works a peach, no problem
[08:13:12] <antdillon> sjeijk, thats working
[08:13:57] <sjeijk> ye :) you are right
[08:14:02] <sjeijk> check it here
[08:14:04] <sjeijk> http://www.paushuize.nl/zakelijke-bijeenkomsten.html
[08:14:04] <antdillon> sjeijk, when you enlarge the area it updated the image urls :)
[08:14:12] <NET||abuse> I have reset the calls several times from called by a normal method call to the setTimeout method and it will not work unless i use setTimeout
[08:14:59] <sjeijk> tyvm antdillon for the help learned a little jquery extra
[08:15:40] <antdillon> sjeijk, no problem
[08:16:34] <f1f> sjeijk you will pad your dropdown items? not nice having to adjust horizontally to select from a vertical list :p
[08:17:37] <sjeijk> f1f i have to stick to the design :p
[08:17:54] <f1f> :(
[08:20:11] <atpa8a> oh!
[08:20:12] <atpa8a> hello
[08:21:05] <atpa8a> is it "normal" to have multiple $(document).ready(function(){...}); defined per page?
[08:21:59] <imc> found my problem with jqueryui dialog
[08:22:01] <imc> but not a solution
[08:23:28] <Mage_Dude> atpa8a: Sure, or later you can combine them all into one if you'd like
[08:24:10] <Onkeltem> Hi all
[08:24:21] <Mage_Dude> Does anyone know whether it's possible to use .on() with any other selector than $("body")?
[08:24:56] <dabear> Mage_Dude: any selector :)
[08:25:24] <atpa8a> hmm
[08:25:24] <ShawnRisk> How come my code here is only showing the event once: http://pastebin.com/fmR3MjUN  I can't see to figure out why this is not showing each event in the calendar.
[08:25:41] <atpa8a> for some reason my simplest function is not executing...
[08:25:49] <Mage_Dude> dabear: That's odd because trying to use a #someId doesn't seem to work any longer. And it shouldn't matter whether or not the elements existed at DOM ready correct?
[08:26:11] <baradas> Hi, When I try to invoke a $.mobile.loadPage() inside of a 'pageinit' or a  'pagecreate' , it fails
[08:26:11] <baradas> any idea if this is permitted or when is it safe to invoke a $.mobile.loadPage()
[08:27:40] <imc> baradas: i had to use .changePage() only
[08:28:07] <imc> worked very well, never did a manual loadPage()
[08:28:09] <baradas> Well changePage() will change the page as well, I want to pre-load the page
[08:28:21] <baradas> and not change the view
[08:28:30] <imc> right
[08:28:50] <imc> so when the main page is loading (pageinit / pagecreate) you want to start preloading other pages as well
[08:28:53] <ShawnRisk> in my code is line 46 correct?
[08:29:02] <baradas> Yes that is correct
[08:29:24] <imc> well, the hook's selected must be the main page i guess
[08:29:53] <imc> if you bind a "generic" pagecreate you obviously get an infinite recursion or something in the like
[08:30:11] <atpa8a> any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/T29ZZ/1/
[08:30:23] <imc> as those events are more or less fired when you loadPage() (still guessing)
[08:30:49] <oxez> Hello. I use $("#myForm").serialize() to extract the data of a form, and then send this data in an ajax request to show custom search results. What I want to do: If a user click on a result, then hit his browser's back button, I want the form's checkboxes/value to persist (even tho the form never actually got submitted). It currently works out of the box for Chrome, but I want IE7+ and FF to act the same way.
[08:31:01] <baradas> I am actually just binding it to the 'pagecreate'/'pageinit' of not the main page  but one of the sub-pages
[08:31:01] <Onkeltem> http://jsfiddle.net/7UbcR/1/ - my question. Please, help :)
[08:31:56] <sjeijk> atpa8a you choose moo tools instead of jquery
[08:32:28] <atpa8a> sjeijk: what do you mean?
[08:32:40] <shwaiil> Hi!
[08:32:44] <sjeijk> in the left bar you need to choose the framework
[08:32:56] <atpa8a> oh
[08:32:57] <xckpd7> question: I have a form I want to stop from submitting.... I wonder if  I"m going about it the wrong way... right now I'm binding preventDefault to a click handler, but who knows how many ways that submit button has of triggering
[08:33:28] <atpa8a> huh!
[08:33:28] <warrenparsons> xckpd7: $('#myForm').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); ...
[08:33:48] <atpa8a> sjeijk: thanks! now it works! but it doesn't work on my page... what can be a reason?
[08:33:55] <xckpd7> warrenparsons: yes!
[08:33:57] <baradas> @imc any ideas as to whether binding loadPage() to the subpage would work
[08:34:01] <xckpd7> warrenparsons++
[08:34:18] <sjeijk> you need to link jquery lib probably in your page
[08:34:27] <atpa8a> hmm
[08:34:37] <atpa8a> trying
[08:34:40] <atpa8a> thanks
[08:35:04] <shwaiil> Q: I need some tips on how to create a Auto Text Sugestion Input box. I want to get some data and save it as JSON. When the user starts typing in the input box, some sugestions are displayed. Maybe this could be selectable aswell. Any tip on how to do this ? Any practical example ? Thanks for looking. Any tip is appreciated.
[08:35:42] <keirlav87> can anyone please tell me why the following ends up as 28 ? --> http://jsfiddle.net/fYu4x/
[08:35:42] <imc> baradas: normally yes
[08:35:50] <imc> baradas: just keep an eye on your markup
[08:35:52] <NoiseEee> shwaiil: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[08:36:00] <atpa8a> actually... jquery is loaded but *after* my scriptlet... does that matter?
[08:36:12] <imc> jquery mobile uses a "flat" model, i.e. all the pages are at the same nesting level
[08:36:28] <imc> when you loadPage() it should be appended after the last one
[08:36:51] <imc> baradas: try to manually do a loadPage() (i.e. firebug's console) and see what happens
[08:36:54] <imc> instead of binding it
[08:37:04] <shwaiil> NoiseEee: Thanks for looking :)
[08:37:16] <sjeijk> put this ion your head atpa8a <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:37:32] <sjeijk> html head that is :)
[08:37:35] <baradas> Well it does work at other times when the page has been loaded for instance….and in some XHR response
[08:37:45] <atpa8a> :P
[08:38:02] <baradas> However, when I am binding it within a pagelive/pagecreate,  nada
[08:38:31] <baradas> I will try pausing within the pageinit and fire a loadPage and check
[08:38:34] <imc> i'm afraid i won't be of much help baradas
[08:38:50] <atpa8a> sjeijk: web sphere portal app :) jquery is loaded (looking at the source) but i don't know from which portlet

[08:38:58] <atpa8a> i hate wps
[08:40:50] <keirlav87> anyone familiar with datejs can explain why the following is giving me a result of 28? -->

[08:41:06] <keirlav87> i'm not even sure its a date.js issue so if anyone would mind taking a look
[08:41:50] <atpa8a> hm
[08:42:03] <atpa8a> no worky...
[08:45:16] <atpa8a> hmm

[08:46:29] <Gergov> guys if i have 2 divs with register forms. and i show and hide the divs depends on what button users clicks.. now if the default state is register1 is visible, and register2 is hidden. what if i decide to register with register2 and then i mess up my passwords and the page reloads .. then the shown form is again register1. any way to make it register2 after the submit ?
[08:49:00] <atpa8a> sjeijk: yes :) but i don't even know where <head> is in this mess
[08:49:03] <atpa8a> thanks
[08:50:28] <marigoLd> Q: I'm trying to combine on() with not(), how do I do this? $('#id').on("click", ".class", function(){...
[08:50:39] <marigoLd> it should do all .class but not(".active")
[08:50:50] <marigoLd> so not .class.active
[08:51:38] <ajpiano> marigoLd: $("#id").on("click", ".class:not(.active)", fn)
[08:51:51] <marigoLd> but i read that it's not adviced to use :not ?
[08:52:24] <ajpiano> the alternative is to do
[08:52:38] <supsup> anyone have a prefrence of mongoDB or CouchDB or none?   I know one size never fits all but in general ?
[08:52:50] <ajpiano> marigoLd: $("#id").on("click", ".class", function(e) {  if ( !$(e.target).hasClass("active") ) { }  });
[08:53:01] <ajpiano> marigoLd: it's really not very likely to make a tangible difference to your application
[08:53:14] <marigoLd> ok fair enough
[08:54:05] <glauco29> Hi
[08:54:15] <glauco29> I need check if a value is a number
[08:54:18] <imc> found the _cause_ of my jquery ui dialog bug !!!!!
[08:54:25] <imc> after almost a whole working day
[08:54:31] <imc> tinymce is _evil_
[08:54:35] <jedimind> imc, let me guess, you forgot to clear a float somewhere?
[08:54:41] <imc> nope
[08:54:42] <fleur> glauco29: that's not really jquery related, check 'typeof'
[08:54:50] <glauco29> I am using isNaN(parseInt(value))
[08:54:50] <marigoLd> ok thx a bunch ajpiano!
[08:54:52] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:54:59] <marigoLd> it works
[08:55:08] <imc> with tinymce on the same page, the origin <div> was not removed from dom after .dialog() init. without tinymce everything works as expected
[08:55:09] <glauco29> number I wanna mean numeric
[08:55:24] <imc> jedimind: you were trolling, weren't you?
[08:55:30] <DukeDrake> I have a select with some options which have the velue attribute set
[08:55:48] <fleur> glauco29: iirc isNaN takes a String, no ?
[08:56:09] <glauco29> I am getting value from an input
[08:56:10] <DukeDrake> but if I retrieve #myselect.val() it show me the _text_ of the selected option element and not the value
[08:56:14] <DukeDrake> how can I fix that?
[08:56:23] <DukeDrake> +s
[08:56:33] <glauco29>  isNaN(parseInt($.trim($('#field').val()))
[08:57:15] <tetradon> How do you hover over a div, show another div and when you hover over that div not cause the div to try to hide and show itself really quickly?
[08:58:16] <jedimind> imc, partially, i did debug a ui-dialog a few days ago where the guy didnt clear something properly on his page content
[08:58:22] <jedimind> and what was interfering with the ui dialog
[08:59:52] <tetradon> Basically I want to be able to hover over both divs without the 2nd div trying to hide itself because I'm no longer hovering over the 1st div
[09:00:26] <imc> jedimind: well, i am able to use firebug at least
[09:00:35] <imc> clearly not a markup problem
[09:00:41] <imc> from tinymce_src.js :
[09:00:51] <imc> Patch various jQuery functions to handle tinymce specific attribute and content behavior
[09:01:06] <tetradon> I tried to give them both the same class names but that didn't work
[09:01:18] <imc> in particular the jQuery.html() method is behaving incorrectly after tinymce does its dirty dirty things
[09:02:05] <mikunos> hi guys I have a strange problem with jquery.  If I click on the Video1 or Video2 in this code I see only the first video, why? http://jsfiddle.net/FPqwN/6/
[09:03:00] <microhxo> I want to remove a child div from a parent dive and inject it elsewhere. How can i do this?
[09:03:04] <microhxo> *div
[09:03:20] <mikunos> any hint?
[09:03:24] <jedimind> imc, url ?
[09:05:19] <permaflex68> ciao
[09:05:23] <permaflex68> !list
[09:05:48] <permaflex68> ciao a tutti
[09:06:01] <permaflex68> !list
[09:06:20] <tetradon> microhxo: $('parentName').remove('childName') then $('newParent').add('childName')
[09:06:36] <microhxo> will remove kill any handlers or anything from it?
[09:06:53] <ajpiano> yes, remove destroys handlers and associated data
[09:06:59] <microhxo> so i should just hide it then?
[09:07:06] <ajpiano> if you want to remove an element from the dom without destroying events/data, use see ?detach
[09:07:07] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[09:07:12] <microhxo> Thanks a lot.
[09:10:28] <imc> jedimind: what url?
[09:10:50] <jedimind> uhm the url showing your problem?

[09:16:18] <keirlav87> its supposed to return the number of non weekend days in a month
[09:20:20] <Mage_Dude> Is there anything more annoying than something working in jsfiddle but not when moved to your code? Grrrr.
[09:22:10] <nFFF> keirlav87
[09:22:19] <mikunos> any help?
[09:23:15] <atpa8a> Mage_Dude: there is! when it's working *everywhere* except websphere portal :P
[09:24:39] <andrew91831> keirlav87: http://jsfiddle.net/fYu4x/5/
[09:24:46] <andrew91831> your addDays isn't working it seems
[09:25:07] <andrew91831> because you're not adding 1 every time
[09:25:12] <andrew91831> you're adding i,
[09:25:18] <andrew91831> so it'll add 1, then 2, then 3, etc
[09:27:32] <microhxo> ajpiano: I am having trouble with this.                  $('.t-page-size').detach();   $('.t-page-size').appendTo('.t-grid-pager');   Doesnt work.   $('.t-page-size').detach();  works fine but the appendTo doesn't work.
[09:27:53] <crivera> given an element, is there a way to traverse its parents looking for one with a specific class/id?
[09:28:07] <andrew91831> are you attaching a class to t-grid-pager ?
[09:28:16] <andrew91831> crivera: use .find
[09:28:20] <crivera> oh nice
[09:28:21] <crivera> thanks
[09:28:24] <andrew91831> oh its parents, use closest()
[09:28:40] <microhxo> andrew, i want to attach a div to the div t-grid-pager div.
[09:28:43] <crivera> even better
[09:28:46] <microhxo> they dont have id's just classes
[09:29:06] <DerekPioneer> console.log($('#select_15880',parent.document.body).html());        logs the parent (i'm inside an iframes) html successfully
[09:29:13] <nFFF> keirlav87 can't you do this some other way
[09:29:13] <andrew91831> crivera: keep in mind that closest only matches once, if you want multiple matches, use parents()
[09:29:19] <DerekPioneer> but i cannot append that value
[09:29:22] <DerekPioneer> inside the iframe
[09:29:34] <andrew91831> microhxo: jsfiddle it
[09:29:35] <ajpiano> microhxo: you can't query the dom for something that isn't there anymore
[09:29:58] <ajpiano> microhxo: var elem = $("#whatever").detach();   elem.appendTo("#somethingElse")
[09:30:20] <microhxo> Ah, thanks.
[09:30:21] <keirlav87> nFFF: at this point i'm very open to suggestions :P what would you suggest?
[09:31:31] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/fYu4x/7/
[09:31:40] <nFFF> That should work
[09:32:41] <nFFF> You might want to make ($totalDays%7) a variable and check to make sure its <=5
[09:32:51] <nFFF> if not remove another day
[09:33:17] <crivera> andrew91831: this.closest is complaining that closest isn't defined
[09:33:36] <andrew91831> closest is jquer
[09:33:39] <andrew91831> jquery
[09:33:47] <crivera> ah, this is the elemnt itself?
[09:33:59] <microhxo> ajpiano: that worked nicely, however it no longer functions.  It was a div that contained a dropdown selector. Now it wont open.
[09:34:02] <andrew91831> you need to use $(this).closest()
[09:34:08] <crivera> bingo
[09:34:09] <crivera> thanks
[09:34:21] <ajpiano> microhxo: can't debug that without a fiddle, can't really debug it with one either at the moment
[09:34:30] <mikunos> no hint?
[09:34:44] <keirlav87> nFFF: seems to return 23 for march when there should only be 22
[09:36:00] <andrew91831> microhxo: sounds like you need to use delegate
[09:36:30] <nFFF> keirlav87, did you read what I said??
[09:36:39] <nFFF> <nFFF> You might want to make ($totalDays%7) a variable and check to make sure its <=5

[09:39:40] <nFFF> keirlav87, actually, you need to know the day the month starts on
[09:41:19] <nFFF> Can you get the day as an index?

[09:49:58] <mikunos> I have a strange problem with jquery.  If I click on the Video1 or Video2 in this code I see only the first video, why? http://jsfiddle.net/FPqwN/6/
[09:53:08] <mikunos> is there anybody?
[09:53:23] <IceTrAiN> mikunos: disclaimer; i have next to 0 jquery experience.  that aside, i would assume it has something to do with caching, since you're only loading the player once on document load, rather than calling it on a click function
[09:53:55] <mikunos> IceTrAiN hi
[09:54:17] <thang> mikunos: if you put an alert under the vf line, youll notice that the variable is assigned only once
[09:54:31] <thang> to the first video
[09:54:37] <mikunos> let me see
[09:55:57] <mikunos> I don't know how to solve it
[09:57:10] <mikunos> thang can u help me to solve it?
[09:57:11] <andrew91831> well it doesn't seem like its the caching
[09:57:17] <andrew91831> since if you run it and click video 2 first, it works
[09:57:37] <mikunos> andrew91831: nope
[09:57:52] <mikunos> works only the first one

[10:03:05] <keirlav87> nFFF: sorry to trouble you with this
[10:03:17] <codart> ou 'll see my comment
[10:03:35] <codart> it's m problem
[10:03:58] <codart> this.current = this.imgs.first(); // damn! It's never go to this case

[10:06:44] <codart> i have a jquery stack of images and used .next() to loop through all images
[10:07:02] <codart> but...
[10:07:03] <eddyb> http://davidwalsh.name/ms
[10:08:20] <codart> i dont know how to set the pointer "current" back to the first image after playing with the last :(
[10:08:38] <codart> srr 4 my so bad english :(
[10:09:01] <Zzaichik> So does it actually get through all the images even?
[10:09:12] <iLike> codart, next does not return to the first element after the last was reached
[10:09:37] <iLike> so you need to check whether next() is empty, if it is go to the first element
[10:09:39] <codart> so... what i must do?
[10:10:00] <codart> imgs.next() == null ?
[10:10:12] <iLike> for example
[10:10:19] <Zzaichik> in the if statement
[10:10:25] <codart> i've tr this before
[10:10:34] <codart> but fail =,=
[10:11:36] <Zzaichik> Is this just for fun or an actual project? there's lots of decent plugins that already exist that will do what you want.
[10:12:19] <codart> it's just for practice
[10:12:24] <Zzaichik> okay cool
[10:12:35] <codart> i'm bored of using other goods
[10:13:12] <codart> if using an array
[10:13:24] <codart> i can fix this problem..
[10:13:53] <gehsekky> arrays fix everything. it's true.
[10:13:55] <codart> but i wanna beating the monster :))
[10:14:27] <keirlav87> what month do our clocks go back / forward in first time?
[10:14:32] <Zzaichik> I would use something like this  $(".scroll-list").prepend(li);  and put them in a <ul>

[10:15:55] <mikunos> nothing to do! I have spent a day to solve this http://jsfiddle.net/FPqwN/22/ does anybody can help me, please?
[10:16:05] <codart> seem to i have to fix it m self, btw thank dudes :D

[10:24:09] <iLike> as you can see, it will just stay on the 2nd image. If you look at the source you can see why, .next() doesn't set the pointer to that image
[10:24:14] <Zzaichik> is the <a> being added dynamically?
[10:24:27] <codart> so...
[10:24:29] <iLike> imgs will still hold all the images inside the div

[10:24:39] <mikunos> any hint?

[10:24:48] <Zzaichik> ?on @KWhat_Work
[10:24:49] <bot-t> KWhat_Work, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[10:26:18] <codart> some 1 wonder why i use this. , any thing wrong?
[10:26:20] <iLike> So you check whether that's the last element.
[10:26:38] <KWhat_Work> let me apply it above with its own selectorr
[10:26:42] <nFFF> keirlav87_ did you sort it?
[10:26:52] <codart> he said "u use the function as constructor?"
[10:27:02] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: You're missing a closing karen - http://jsfiddle.net/eHeKF/4/
[10:27:16] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: I mean paren, as in parentheses.
[10:27:18] <Zzaichik> KWhat_Work: So you wrote it like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/eHeKF/5/

[10:28:36] <microhxo> I have a problem with laying out some elements in a footer..  All the elements are generated on page load via telerik controls so i dont really have access to them.

[10:29:39] <[kungen]> Im having some issues with a jquery problem with lightbox type and  portfolio jquery script, the lightbox script doesnt work in the portfolio script, check htt://www.robscorner.net/robinmedia/portfolio.html
[10:29:41] <microhxo> Basically i want to push everything to the right of that displaying text to float RIGHT. My problem is that they aren't contained in a div and i cant move each one individually because depending upon how many pages there are, there can be more elements.
[10:29:42] <KWhat_Work> Zzaichik: also console.debug($('a:')); finds what I am looking for, but .click does nto bind
[10:29:43] <WebDragon> okay, I have an issue here I thought would be controllable with jquery -- the baseline css does the dropdown visibility via display: none|block; and then I was hoping to modify it with jquery to slow down the visibility with either fadeIn|fadeOut or slideDown|slideUp but so long as I have the display: block; on the css it's failing
[10:30:16] <keirlav87_> sticking with my method i know what the problem is now
[10:30:17] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: If you're inserting the a element dynamically, you have to use event delegation to attach an event listener to it.
[10:30:21] <WebDragon> I have some concern that it's because the exact css selector that I'm using to trigger the drop down in the css isn't the same one I'm using as the controller via jquery and that may be why it's not doing the fancybits
[10:30:24] <mikunos> any help?
[10:30:28] <nFFF> keirlav87_
[10:30:31] <nFFF> Can you try this:
[10:30:31] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/fYu4x/9/
[10:30:35] <nFFF> and see if it works for all months
[10:30:36] <WebDragon> example : http://devel.w-m-t.com/  on the Products submenu
[10:30:38] <nFFF> :<<<
[10:30:42] <nFFF> My head hurts now
[10:31:22] <WebDragon> so my question is, is my guess correct that it's the difference in the selectors being used in the css vs the jquery the cause of the slide/fade not working as expected to override the base display: css ?
[10:31:41] <microhxo> How can i append an empty div into a class?
[10:31:42] <DerekPioneer> where's that jquery.com article about delegation?
[10:31:50] <DerekPioneer> google is not helping
[10:31:58] <KWhat_Work> warrenparsons: yah $('#list').delegate('a:[title="Delete"]', 'click', function(e) { still does not work
[10:32:11] <WebDragon> $(".class").append("<div />"); ?
[10:32:20] <keirlav87_> nFFF: it seems to add an extra day to months with 31 days?
[10:32:34] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: a:[title… is wrong. Should be a[title=… if you're gonna use that.
[10:32:42] <nFFF> Fuck it I give up :DD
[10:32:48] <nFFF> Im sure it can be done mathmetically thugh
[10:32:49] <codart> @iLike: nope, i cant understand wat the hell is going on
[10:32:57] <nFFF> Which will be a lot faster than checking each day

[10:33:42] * WebDragon may have to start asking questions in shorter sentences to keep up with the scroll in here by generating more of it :P
[10:33:47] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: Are you getting any errors? Are you using console.log() commands to see if the element is being seen by JS?
[10:34:02] <KWhat_Work> no, console.debug($('a[title="Delete"]')); works as expected, not binding is occurring
[10:34:10] <microhxo> WebDragon: thanks

[10:35:20] <KWhat_Work> does anyone actually like js ?
[10:35:25] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: Try $('body').on('click', 'a[title="Delete"], function(){ … }); When that works, change your delegating element to something lower level.
[10:35:57] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: And don't just copy/paste that. I made a syntax error.
[10:36:03] <codart> @iLike: holyshit :D
[10:36:18] <iLike> codart, makes sense?
[10:36:53] <WebDragon> #navM li:hover .dropdown5column {  <-- if I remove the display: block; from this selector in the css (causing the css to fail to display the menu when js is disabled) then the jquery works as expected
[10:36:56] <codart> i'll look into it again
[10:36:58] <r00b> Can someone help me with a basic jquery problem i think.
[10:37:04] <codart> ultil understand :d
[10:37:15] <WebDragon> if I make sure the css works in the instances where js is disabled, then the js fails
[10:37:18] <KWhat_Work> warrenparsons: yah that worked... I wonder if I cant delegate on an item that was inserted dynamically
[10:37:26] <nFFF> keirlav87_, does it work now :<
[10:38:00] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: No. You can't. The element you're delegating to has to be in the document at load time.
[10:38:15] <KWhat_Work> good to know
[10:38:47] <microhxo> Does anyone know how i can right float everything after a specific div?
[10:38:49] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: And for the record, JS is wonderful. You just need to understand how it works.
[10:39:02] <Gates> is it possible use content to change font-size in an iframe?
[10:39:42] <Zzaichik> KWhat_Work: okay you got what you needed then?
[10:39:49] <KWhat_Work> warrenparsons: i understand how it works and thats exactly why i dislike it
[10:39:54] <KWhat_Work> yah thanks Zzaichik
[10:39:55] <webe> Hello, I'm looking for some help. I have created an accordian here: http://jsfiddle.net/jurbank/F29Mq/2/ I want the links on the right to level with "MORE" on click.
[10:40:05] <microhxo> Is it possible with jquery to add everything after a class to its own div?  I need to wrap a few elements into 1 div so i can right float them
[10:40:17] <warrenparsons> KWhat_Work: I don't mean to be harsh, but you clearly do not understand how it works. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked if you could delegate to a dynamically-inserted element.
[10:40:25] <codart> @iLike: but... current is a member img. why it can have .next() method which i think only apply to a stack @@
[10:41:02] <Zzaichik> r00b: what's your question
[10:41:03] <iLike> as long as there are only images in the div, it will just walk the DOM in that div
[10:41:05] <iLike> now, brb
[10:41:17] <keirlav87_> still seems to be adding 1 to some months
[10:41:35] <r00b> Well, im having an issue getting two scripts to work togheter
[10:41:36] <LukeNukem> hello
[10:41:41] <LukeNukem> any of you who use facebook here?
[10:41:42] <WebDragon> man this is just WEIRD
[10:41:48] <LukeNukem> Hi WebDragon
[10:41:55] <WebDragon> why. won't. you. work!?
[10:41:57] <Zzaichik> Go on...
[10:42:02] <WebDragon> hey luke
[10:42:06] <r00b> http://robscorner.net/robinmedia/portfolio.html     the thumb top left is linked to my lightbox script named videobox, but it doesnt work, but the thumb in the footer works great.
[10:42:39] <codart> so good...
[10:43:09] <codart> i've understand it clearly
[10:43:23] <codart> thank, dude :D
[10:43:53] <Zzaichik> r00b: it's navigating to the href provided..
[10:44:31] <r00b> yes, but if you see the thumb on the bottom or on index.php and the 3 thumbs, it uses a lightbox script.
[10:44:42] <Zzaichik> okay
[10:44:50] <r00b> index.html
[10:44:53] <Zzaichik> and it's not even close to the same markup but go on
[10:45:20] <r00b> how you mean?
[10:46:04] <Zzaichik> the one on the bottom is an img in a div in a div in an a tag
[10:46:07] <r00b> i just put class="vixbox" and it should work
[10:46:44] <r00b> yes, but that shouldnt matter i think, because i use a <a to activate the vidbox script
[10:47:59] <Zzaichik> r00b: okay so without sifting through your code, vidbox isn't working and the <a> is doing exactly what it's told to do.
[10:48:08] <r00b> yes
[10:48:23] <r00b> the vixbox doesnt work in the portfolio script thing.
[10:48:25] <r00b> but in the footer it works.
[10:48:26] <mikunos> why the links doesn't load the right video? http://jsfiddle.net/FPqwN/22/
[10:51:09] <mikunos> any help?
[10:51:39] <webe> Hello, I'm looking for some help. I have created an accordian here: http://jsfiddle.net/jurbank/F29Mq/2/ I want the links on the right to level with "MORE" on click.
[10:53:14] <r00b> Zzaichik: any idea why it doesnt work?
[10:53:39] <zmbmartin> Can I detect when a popup window has unfocused?
[10:54:06] <mikunos> any help please?
[10:54:22] <WebDragon> http://devel.w-m-t.com/  there -- still not perfect but adding a .js class to body enabled me to override the css selector when js is enabled so that the jquery can take effect before display: none vanishes the menu on the css
[10:54:40] <Zzaichik> r00b: sorry, I was trying to look through it, I just can't spend a ton of time sifting through all of your code
[10:54:44] <WebDragon> now I just gotta fix the bit where the styles within the dropdown change before it's able to fade out
[10:55:08] <r00b> alright, ty anyway
[11:04:57] <keirlav87_> wooo i've done it i think would someone mind casting a scrutinous eye over this function please, it's designed to return the number of working (i.e. non weekend ) days in any calendar month -> http://jsfiddle.net/fYu4x/24/
[11:06:59] <nebiros> somebody knows how to use .on() with draggable elements?
[11:07:06] <jerwilkins> hey all, working through an issue where this points to the window object rather than my selectors on bind; here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/d23cbc161046ae6e2333 any notions?
[11:09:41] <ngharo> jerwilkins: wrap your error handler in function() { }
[11:09:46] <ngharo> like you are doing for load:
[11:09:48] <Es0teric|AFK> i have multiple data-types on one page… and for some reason, jquery doesnt fire the different ones when hovered… just the first data-type on the script.. how do i make jquery actually switch to the current one after a hover is triggered?
[11:10:21] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, that fiddle you made yesterday worked great but now it doesnt log the multiple data-types on the script
[11:10:25] <jerwilkins> ngharo: will give it a shot!
[11:10:28] <Es0teric|AFK> unless i collect them in a array
[11:10:43] <ngharo> ?p
[11:10:44] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:11:00] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo -> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/hWD2W/3/
[11:11:03] <Es0teric|AFK> thats what you gave me yesterday
[11:11:41] <ngharo> yeah and it works ... ?
[11:12:09] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, no it doesnt… it just picks ONE data-type up, not all on the page
[11:12:10] <WebDragon> http://devel.w-m-t.com/  hrm. I used .stop() to prevent animation queue build-up, but it's had the unfortunate side effect of allowing you to freeze the megamenu in a state where it's partially faded if you mouseout and back in again. it doesn't complete it back to full
[11:12:24] <WebDragon> I know there's a way to fix this but can't recall the techniqueu
[11:12:30] <WebDragon> technique*
[11:12:37] <WebDragon> anyone?
[11:12:42] <codart> some one bring me back to home, i've go too far =,= http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/25/
[11:12:45] <ngharo> Es0teric|AFK: what is the desired effect, i dont get it
[11:13:21] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, right now when i hover over the .assgnmt_img, it fires off only "option"
[11:13:29] <Es0teric|AFK> and i have 7 other data-types
[11:13:41] <Es0teric|AFK> i want each corresponding data-type to fire off
[11:13:58] <ngharo> what do you mean by fire?  just print the text?
[11:14:24] <Eviltwin> Es0teric's sure doing a lot of talking for being AFK
[11:14:27] <WebDragon> oh eyeah stop(true,true)
[11:14:33] <WebDragon> nevermind :)
[11:14:43] * WebDragon hits the THAT WAS EASY button
[11:14:54] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, no.. what i mean by fire is when i console.log(type);, it only shows option when i hover over any of the .assignmt_img
[11:15:08] <microhxo> I want to wrap EVERYTHING inside of  class t-pager that is AFTER class t-status-text in a div.. How can i do this with jquery?
[11:15:26] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, how is that possible when there are multiple data-types?
[11:15:32] <Es0teric|AFK> and not of the same name
[11:15:53] <ngharo> i still dont follow, check your console: http://jsfiddle.net/hWD2W/4/
[11:16:10] <ngharo> there are three different data-type's here
[11:16:27] <tw2113> i think he wants data-foo, data-bar, data-something
[11:16:36] <codart> help
[11:16:57] <codart> http://jsfiddle.net/codart/Awnr7/25/
[11:17:01] <tw2113> not data-type="1", data-type="2" etc
[11:17:24] <ngharo> tw2113: yeah i have no clue
[11:17:30] <ezio> how can i find just the class methods for a $('select')
[11:17:46] <ngharo> codart: your link would be better followed with a question
[11:18:08] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, well for some reason for me its only showing "type"
[11:18:32] <Es0teric|AFK> not type "Option""
[11:19:03] <ngharo> ?p @ Es0teric|AFK
[11:19:04] <bot-t> Es0teric|AFK, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:19:32] <ngharo> english bad, code gud
[11:20:18] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo -> http://jsfiddle.net/hWD2W/5/
[11:21:31] <ngharo> $('.wrkwk').find('p') - this is why
[11:21:56] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, but when i do $(this).find('p'); it doesnt log anything...
[11:22:11] <ngharo> yes it does
[11:22:33] <ngharo> Es0teric|AFK: im guessing you havent fixed your whacky markup in your application causing jquery not to find stuff where you think it is
[11:22:47] <Es0teric|AFK> ngharo, i did fix my markup
[11:23:10] <ngharo> you sure bro, YOU SURE?
[11:23:16] * tw2113 is seeing console logged full of foobar, ballsack, and unavailable too
[11:23:19] <Es0teric|AFK> yes, i am sure

[11:33:35] <codart> any expert javascript here?

[11:35:19] <Gorgeus> I'm doing a project for mobile devices. One of my task forced me to use jquery mobile. 'vclick' event precisely, i don't need anything else from the library, especially when i cant turn of the 'changepage' features. So is there any other plugin doing 'vclick' job or can I turn of changepage somehow?
[11:35:34] <tw2113> codart i imagine it's just a case of creating a new container with new images, and repeating mahSlider('Slider1', '900px', '350px'); with the right ID and dimensions
[11:35:35] <mordof> gehsekky: yep yep.
[11:35:45] <winterpk66> Hey Mordof.  Do you know gmap3 at all?
[11:36:19] <mordof> winterpk66: i don't know what that is, no
[11:36:32] <mordof> codart: yeah, that code is already compatible with multiple instances
[11:37:00] <Gorgeus> I beg you for help ;)

[11:46:30] <iLike> tw2113, so, what did you change?
[11:46:53] <tw2113> apparently it doesn't like me reusing the function
[11:47:00] <iLike> it doesn't indeed
[11:47:09] <iLike> I'm having a hard time finding out why
[11:47:53] <iLike> how does the JS scope work?>

[11:48:34] <tw2113> *shrug*
[11:48:49] <iLike> I think that next is in a global scope
[11:49:10] <Eviltwin> Unlike many laguages, JavaScript has a tree of scopes
[11:49:22] <iLike> I don't know JS too wel
[11:49:31] <Eviltwin> There's global (the root), local (the leaf), but also all the levels in between

[12:01:57] <DerekPioneer> i must be projecting

[12:02:10] <ajpiano> microhxo: what does the dom look like
[12:02:26] <ajpiano> microhxo: are you trying to magically exclude a parent from having its children or something silly like that?
[12:03:24] <nbari> hi all, is there a way to resize an image showing the corner dots ?
[12:03:24] <microhxo> ajpiano: http://www.2shared.com/photo/hSphQ6yQ/problem.html  see that "Not Div"
[12:03:33] <microhxo> i am trying to WRAP ONLY those elements in their own div
[12:03:37] <microhxo> so i can float right that.
[12:03:51] <microhxo> whats happening is that my query is grabbing all the div's i said NOT to.
[12:03:51] <ajpiano> microhxo: i didn't mean "look like" as in "show me a screen shot"
[12:04:17] <ajpiano> i meant the actual dom structure. if you have a fiddle i can help
[12:04:17] <tos9> If I create a deferred, then add two callbacks to it with .then, they appear to be added in parallel. How can I add them sequentially, such that d = $.Deferred().then(function_a) and then add b to that callback chain where b gets function_a's return value not the result of the deferred's resolve()
[12:04:29] * chee has a fiddle
[12:04:35] <winterpk66> Does anyone konw how to get the actual google map object out of gmap3 after you already created the map?
[12:04:49] <microhxo> ajpiano: this is what it looks like AFTER i apply my code: http://paste2.org/p/1912977
[12:05:05] <microhxo> line 9 - 11 shouldnt be in that div..
[12:05:06] <OriginalUsernm> Greetings!  Does anyone know why the jQuery UI Accordion still has that jumpy behavior when animates?  Does anyone know how to fix it other then setting CSS rules on the 'changestart' and 'change' events to compensate?  ( which does work, but is hacky).
[12:05:07] <ajpiano> microhxo: if you keep show me irrelevant things i will not have time to look at the relevant  one
[12:05:10] <microhxo> i excluded them.
[12:05:24] <microhxo> how do i show you the dom?
[12:05:49] <ajpiano> you make a live demo of your code that isn't working properly on jsfiddle or jsbin
[12:05:53] <nbari> I mean the corner squerres so that a user can resize the image under a editor like tinymce
[12:06:12] <microhxo> ajpiano. Not possible. I am using telerik controls
[12:06:52] <ajpiano> it's certainly *possible* to somehow start with the html that is there befoer your jquery code is run
[12:06:55] <ScorpionHD> Can someone check if my selectors are correct, I am a bit confused  on lines 68 - 76 http://jsfiddle.net/g85VE/1/
[12:06:57] <ajpiano> and then show the code running, etc
[12:07:37] <microhxo> var towrap = $('.t-pager').not('.t-status').not('.t-page-size').not('.t-status-text') This is where my problem is.  Does this code function like so:   Select every element INSIDE of .t-pager EXCEPT for t-status, t-page-size and t-status-text    no?
[12:07:45] <ajpiano> microhxo: fyi, you can also do $(".foo").not(".bar,.baz,.bat")
[12:08:00] <ajpiano> no, it does not function like that at all
[12:08:15] <ajpiano> it says give me all elements that are .t-pager that are not any of those other classes
[12:08:26] <ajpiano> you're filtering the existing element, not searching its children
[12:08:58] <microhxo> I want everything Inside of t-pager that is NOT the classes i list..
[12:09:28] <ajpiano> i'm not sure you actually want that either but uh
[12:09:51] <ajpiano> $(".t-pager").find(":not(.a,.b,.c)") will do the trick
[12:10:14] <Deele> I'm trying to install a https://github.com/tarcieri/cool.io as I understood, it is a gem, I cloned that git, trying to "gem build cool.io.gemspec", but it says "invalid gemspec", am I doing something wrong? "gem install cool.io" returns "The 'iobuffer' native gem requires installed build tools."
[12:10:18] <microhxo> Yea, there are only 3 div's inside of the main class and then there are some links that are dynamic depending upon the number of pages. I want to div those dynamic things so i can right float them.
[12:10:25] <ajpiano> tos9: you might have to look into using more than one deferred, perhaps with see ?deferred.pipe
[12:10:26] <bot-t> tos9, deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[12:10:26] <microhxo> Thanks for the help ajpiano
[12:11:12] <ajpiano> thank you for using "div" as a verb
[12:11:23] <tos9> bot-t, ajpian: Oh. I looked at that and for some reason discarded it. Thanks. I'll take another look.
[12:11:25] <bot-t> tos9, Couldn't find "ajpian: Oh. I looked at that and for some reason discarded it. Thanks. I'll take another look." in jQuery Docs.
[12:11:38] <ajpiano> Deele: wrong channel?
[12:11:43] <Deele> ajpiano, yes
[12:11:47] <ajpiano> :)
[12:12:25] <snover> I fucking div it?
[12:13:23] <microhxo> ajpiano: That code worked, it found all the things i wanted. How can i add them to my t-pager class as a div now?
[12:13:57] <ajpiano> .wrapAll("<div>").parent().appendTo("whatever")
[12:14:09] <microhxo> thanks
[12:14:55] <microhxo> what is "whatever"?
[12:15:09] <xp_prg> how do I set a column's width of a table?
[12:17:41] <ScorpionHD> ajpiano could you help me out with some selectors?
[12:17:42] <thang> xp_prg: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.4.4
[12:17:49] <ajpiano> maybe
[12:18:02] <ajpiano> don't ask to ask etc etc
[12:18:20] <ScorpionHD> http://jsfiddle.net/g85VE/1/ can you look at lines 68 - 76 tell me what I am doing wrong
[12:19:15] <ShawnRisk> how come my code only shows 1 event per date and not many events per date: http://pastebin.com/ZVw2mUie
[12:19:17] <ShawnRisk> ?
[12:19:20] <ScorpionHD> its for an accordion
[12:19:42] <ajpiano> ScorpionHD: are you trying to have a jquery ui accordion where more than one pane is open at a time?
[12:20:13] <ScorpionHD> ajpiano: YES!
[12:20:30] <xp_prg> if my table has id mytable how do I set the first column's width to 50px?
[12:21:01] <ajpiano> ScorpionHD: the wijmo accordion is built on top of the ui accordion and allows you to have multiple panes open http://wijmo.com/demo/explore/#accordion|requireOpenedPane
[12:21:06] <ajpiano> i think it's part of their "free" suite
[12:21:18] <eddyb> hi
[12:21:19] <ajpiano> and it's probably a lot less painful for you than sitting there trying to manually disrupt the state of the accordion
[12:21:58] <eddyb> any idea how I can detect a flexbox-triggered resize of an element?
[12:22:04] <eddyb> .resize is for window only
[12:22:22] <ScorpionHD> ajpiano: its for a WP plugin and I just need it to load all open when settings.active == all
[12:22:40] <ScorpionHD> all is being passed by the shortcode
[12:22:52] <ajpiano> ScorpionHD: the ui accordion is designed to have a single pane open at a time
[12:23:03] <ajpiano> trying to screw with that externally will result in very odd things happening with the plugin
[12:23:51] <eddyb> for example, how can I detect a <textarea> has been resized?
[12:23:53] <ScorpionHD> ajpiano: I noticed when I tried to load it the Styles changed by the panes weren't opening
[12:23:57] <xp_prg> nobody wants to help me :(
[12:24:02] <thang> xp_prg: check out jquery selectors & css(), you can match with something like $('#myTable col:first')
[12:24:12] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my code?
[12:24:36] <eddyb> chrome provides a grip by default to that textarea
[12:24:45] <eddyb> can I detect it has been resized?
[12:25:28] <ScorpionHD> eddyb: wouldnt it be browser specific?
[12:25:53] <ajpiano> eddyb: ?g ben alman jquery resize plugin
[12:26:02] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman jquery resize plugin @ eddyb
[12:26:04] <bot-t> eddyb, Ben Alman  jQuery resize event - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[12:26:18] <ajpiano> eddyb: that provides a resize event for element you want using a polling loop, go to town
[12:26:33] <eddyb> ScorpionHD: I don't really care as long as I can hook a handler that tells me the box has been resized
[12:26:46] <eddyb> ajpiano: wouldn't that load the CPU?
[12:27:09] <ajpiano> probably not horribly, benchmark it for yourself
[12:27:17] <ScorpionHD> eddyb: that plug-in is exactly what you are looking for
[12:27:33] <ajpiano> compared to a nonexistent solution that doesn't exist, it's pretty good
[12:27:37] <ajpiano> eddyb: otoh i just had this idea now
[12:27:41] <eddyb> it would be nice if it's triggered on events
[12:27:50] <ajpiano> eddyb: you could bind a mousedown and mouseup event to the textarea
[12:27:54] <eddyb> not running in the background
[12:28:07] <ajpiano> and check it's height/width in each and see if it's different, and in that case, fire your event
[12:28:13] <eddyb> ajpiano: except that's an isolated example
[12:28:26] <ajpiano> sorry for brainstorming i'll go back to my real job
[12:28:35] <eddyb> there are many events that can cause a resize
[12:28:47] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me but that is okay my problem is hard
[12:29:00] <ajpiano> so maybe you should actually look at the perf of the resize event impl and see if its the bogeyman you  fear it is
[12:31:38] <xp_prg> table#mytable tr td:nth-child(1) { width:50px} is not working :(
[12:31:47] <xp_prg> any ideas what I am doing wrong, trying to set the column
[12:32:41] <OriginalUsernm> UI Accordion is jumpy, even on demo at jquery.com. Anyone know if this bug was ever fixed?
[12:37:56] <OriginalUsernm> xp_prg:  do you have 50px is quotes, like '50px'?
[12:38:03] <xp_prg> no
[12:38:09] <OriginalUsernm> it needs to be. try that.
[12:38:12] <xp_prg> ok
[12:40:07] <thang> OriginalUsernm: are you fixed on js for a ui accordion? http://www.paulrhayes.com/2009-06/accordion-using-only-css/
[12:41:19] <OriginalUsernm> thang: that is very nice, thatnk you. Unfortunately, I need IE7 compatibility, so no CSS3 unless this can work with a polyfill.
[12:41:54] <thang> ie7, ouch.
[12:42:26] <OriginalUsernm> thang: haha.. yeah. thanks though. this is pretty cool.
[12:42:46] <xp_prg> table#mytable tr td:nth-child(1) { width:'400px'; } doesn't do anything!
[12:42:55] <xp_prg> I am feeling so dumb, what am I doing wrong?!!
[12:43:52] <OriginalUsernm> xp_prg: can you paste the exact code on hhtp://jsfiddle.net ?
[12:44:05] <OriginalUsernm> xp_prg: i mean http:, not hhtp..
[12:46:25] <ajpiano> xp_prg: OriginalUsernm you don't need the quotes
[12:46:30] <ajpiano> and it works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/HqmyX/
[12:47:04] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/ga656/
[12:48:23] <ajpiano> xp_prg: works fine when you don't put <style> inside of the CSS there
[12:48:24] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ga656/1/
[12:48:34] <xp_prg> oh, I feel dumb then
[12:53:55] <microhxo> ajpiano:  I am still having trouble getting my result..   http://paste2.org/p/1913024
[12:54:08] <microhxo> Very close yet so far :|
[12:54:15] <atpa8a> hmm
[12:54:26] <ajpiano> microhxo: you can't concat an object to a string
[12:54:49] <ajpiano> "<something>"+jqueryobject+"</something>") is not the same as wrapAll
[12:55:40] <microhxo> I tried wrapall but it didnt work how i needed it.  I need to create a div inside of .t-pager and then WRAP all that towrap inside of it.
[12:56:35] <microhxo> Can i wrap all my towrap content into a div and then append that div to .t-pager?
[12:57:09] <hashpuppy> i need to call .load on $("#myselect").change and whenever the page is loaded
[12:57:17] <ajpiano> microhxo: what do you think .wrapAll is for...
[12:57:19] <hashpuppy> is there something that will capture both
[12:57:36] <ajpiano> microhxo: you can do whatever you want
[12:57:39] <OriginalUsernm> xp_prg: you aren't dumb. don't worry.. I think the problem is b/c you have tow <th>, really you should only have one. I made this change and it seemed to work: http://jsfiddle.net/ga656/2/
[12:57:54] <ajpiano> var newDiv = $("<something").appendTo(".t-pager").html( toWrap );
[12:57:58] <xp_prg> yup, I got it to work, thanks :>
[12:57:59] <ajpiano> microhxo: for instance
[12:59:33] <ShawnRisk> seems no one wants to touch my question
[13:02:03] <xp_prg> ok this is weird, I set the width of the table, then I set the first th to a certain width but somehow it is overriden by the length of the table
[13:03:02] <thang> ShawnRisk: try putting your code onto jsfiddle so we can see what you want to do
[13:05:48] <microhxo> ajpiano: ?
[13:06:11] <ajpiano> microhxo: boom, make a new div, set the new shit, put it where you wnat
[13:06:27] <ajpiano> microhxo: i have to go , i can't deal with this anymore right now got a lot on my plate sorry
[13:06:33] <xp_prg> how do I cause a column to do word wrapping?
[13:12:56] <ShawnRisk> thang: thought you would say that

[13:19:45] <atpa8a> hmm
[13:19:50] <crutex> there's probably a dozen dozen carousel plugins :D

[13:20:11] <atpa8a> it works once...
[13:20:18] <jacof> i know, i was actually hoping for a recommendation amongst all the alternatives
[13:20:35] <atpa8a> how would one go about making it work every time the button is clicked?
[13:20:48] <atpa8a> i think it modifies the initial html
[13:20:51] <crutex> pick whichever has the aesthetic closest to your liking, i don't think you'll find much issue in any
[13:21:13] <jacof> alright, thanks then :)
[13:21:22] <crutex> atpa8a, i don't really see any button you're talking about xD
[13:21:57] <atpa8a> in the results???
[13:22:18] <atpa8a> ok
[13:22:29] <atpa8a> try http://jsfiddle.net/T29ZZ/16/
[13:22:37] <atpa8a> gotta hit 'Update' :P
[13:23:11] <crutex> is there a reason you're using 1.4.4
[13:23:26] <atpa8a> yeah... old project
[13:23:33] <atpa8a> it's eve 1.4.2 here

[13:26:47] <atpa8a> great!
[13:27:04] * atpa8a no know javascript

[13:44:42] <toddgeist> looking for help on add binding event in plugins built with widget factory.  I am trying to bind a click event to method on the widget.  It works, but … in the callback "this" is now the element and not the widget instance, so I can't call other methods on the widget from there.
[13:44:42] <FiSHNUGGET> I have a "tweet" button in a container that is emptied and loaded dynamically.  On the first load, the twitter button is great, but after every other load, it appears as a simple link (i.e. it loses all formatting).  How can I reapply to style to the button?
[13:44:48] <toddgeist> http://jsfiddle.net/LE7Ch/4/

[13:58:30] <MFen> hi y'all. i recently upgraded from jquery 1.5.2 to jquery 1.7.1 and i'm getting a weird error: fx.options.curAnim is undefined
[13:58:45] <MFen> any known issues r/t that? i have been on jquery ui 1.8.7 the whole time
[13:58:53] <MFen> (i'm not on jquery 1.8.17 but it didn't make any diff)
[13:58:56] <MFen> now*
[14:00:53] <MFen> hmm. might be due to jquery.svg
[14:01:37] <MFen> which is ancient, alas. blah. guess i'm switching to another svg library
[14:02:21] <inpho> b1lly
[14:02:25] <inpho> that example works great
[14:02:44] <inpho> however, maybe it's because i'm using codeigniter
[14:02:55] <inpho> but instead of it returning any data to the callback function
[14:03:05] <inpho> it just prints the output and has a blank page
[14:03:20] <`Korvin> http://jsfiddle.net/BLbcL/1/ << I want the black bar to be above the dropdowns

[14:11:22] <Eviltwin> That'd because they do do the same thing
[14:11:30] <atpa8a> Eviltwin: no even is going to hold that?
[14:11:31] <Eviltwin> The second is a shorthand for the first
[14:11:38] <atpa8a> s/even/event
[14:11:46] <Eviltwin> atpa8a: Nope
[14:11:53] <dangerousdave> thanks, so the second is preferable?
[14:11:54] <atpa8a> thanks :)
[14:11:58] <atpa8a> sucks tho :)
[14:12:05] <Eviltwin> I mean maybe a mousedown would be triggered on it
[14:12:09] <Eviltwin> Which would have the old event
[14:12:14] <Eviltwin> old value*
[14:12:18] <Eviltwin> But definitely not the new one at that point
[14:12:31] <Eviltwin> I would definitely not rely on that
[14:12:35] <atpa8a> yup

[14:16:50] <inpho> k th

[14:16:54] <Eviltwin> How could it not?
[14:17:27] <inpho> just confirming
[14:17:28] <dangerousdave> my project has multiple .js files, what is best practice, start each file with $(function(), or have a single $(function() which calls out to all other functions?
[14:17:58] <Eviltwin> Do they all do things that need to be done after DOM ready?
[14:18:22] <dangerousdave> Eviltwin: i think so
[14:18:55] <dangerousdave> Eviltwin: but i cant think of anything usefull that could be done before the DOM is ready
[14:19:17] <ebacca> ah, someday to be DOM free ! ok, maybe 10 more years. heh
[14:19:18] <nickey> When i remove a class with js which defines that the onclick event will show a thickbox the thickbox is still shown even though i have removed the class. How can this come? I am using the following to remove the class $('#element').attr('class','another_class');
[14:19:58] <nFFF> ?removeclass
[14:19:59] <bot-t> .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[14:20:07] <ebacca> hey, I have a general question, I have a JQuery tab and on one tab, I dropped a JQuery accordian.  This works and is all good so long as I init accordian first, but I read that JQuery wasn't designed to allow one widget inside of another, is this true ?
[14:20:23] <nickey> nFFF i have tried that also
[14:20:48] <ebacca> er, to simplify, is JQuery designed to allow one widget inside of another ?
[14:21:13] <ajpiano> ebacca: yes.
[14:21:58] <Mage_Dude> http://jsfiddle.net/NF2jz/2499/ Is this something I should report as a bug? No combination of selector and target actually triggers the alert code.
[14:22:29] <ebacca> is the term 'widget' correct for the JQuery entities ? or is 'class' or 'object' more proper ?
[14:22:31] <Mage_Dude> Nevermind. I'm jsut dumb
[14:22:35] <ebacca> such as the tabs or accordian ?
[14:22:51] <ebacca> I just don't want to call it a tabs widget if that's not the right term.
[14:23:06] <`Korvin> http://jsfiddle.net/BLbcL/3/ << can't click the links
[14:24:02] <nFFF> `Korvin :))))))))
[14:24:17] <ebacca> it's been months since being here, I STILL see Jquery as a bridge between old world desktop applications and rich browser based user experiences - some day to get free of the browser, but on the other hand, that's what makes it all so simple to bring workable solutions to users, because they already have that browser container.  ODd JAva just never really took off in user apps.
[14:24:49] <ebacca> well thanks - I'm better off than having not stopped by, and I hope the chan is too !
[14:25:09] <NoiseEee> `Korvin: need hrefs.
[14:25:16] <`Korvin> yeah
[14:25:19] <NoiseEee> `Korvin: also, #css
[14:25:20] <`Korvin> the links aren't clickable though
[14:25:44] <`Korvin> the first dropdown has an href in it
[14:25:44] <NoiseEee> `Korvin: because they don't have hrefs.
[14:25:59] <NoiseEee> `Korvin: and that one is clickable once you get your css straight.
[14:26:09] <NoiseEee> `Korvin: entirely unrelated to #jquery
[14:26:21] <`Korvin> yeah
[14:28:00] <Zzaichik> why is that inner ul's z-index set to −1? That's why nothing is clickable.
[14:32:35] <inpho> this should give you what i'm doing
[14:32:42] <inpho> cant get much easier
[14:32:45] <inpho> http://pastebin.com/n7snXYrH
[14:32:49] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EcgsC/ -> why is he if statement always true?
[14:32:52] <inpho> it's just returning a blank white page
[14:32:53] <nFFF> Im perplexed
[14:34:20] <pootpoot> nFFF: you're not evaluating anything ?
[14:34:55] <NoiseEee> nFFF: if (a.indexOf('whatever') > -1) { //found }
[14:35:24] <nFFF> I hought if it couldnt be found then it return something false...
[14:35:55] <nFFF> if(a.indexOf('whatever')) // found ??
[14:36:32] <nFFF> are you trying to tell me the method returns something positive even when it cant find it??
[14:36:38] <pootpoot> The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string. This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.
[14:37:13] <nFFF> Ok
[14:37:35] <nFFF> if (-1) ?
[14:37:56] <pootpoot> noiseEee gave you the answer
[14:38:08] <pootpoot> evaluate to see if it is > -1
[14:38:18] <nFFF> Yea I get that...
[14:38:40] <nFFF> Im just curious to why it doesnt return a null or false value
[14:39:57] <pixelhandler> nFFF see : http://jsfiddle.net/KtFrd/
[14:41:55] <DerekPioneer> does this work? $('.envelopeColorDetails p')[1]

[14:42:25] <nFFF> ?tias
[14:42:26] <bot-t> Try It And See
[14:44:13] <aaronmcadam> no
[14:44:23] <aaronmcadam> DerekPioneer: that will give u the DOM elements
[14:44:51] <aaronmcadam> DerekPioneer:  `$('.envelopeColorDetails p').eq(1)` is what u want
[14:45:36] <Zzaichik> so close
[14:45:45] <theBrettman> jsfiddle removed jquery ui>
[14:45:46] <aaronmcadam> well actually [0] is the DOM element set, 1 would be another property
[14:46:01] <theBrettman> *?
[14:46:19] <nFFF> $('.envelopeColorDetails p')[1] is the second matched element?
[14:46:31] <nFFF> as an object
[14:46:39] <Zzaichik> ^ = nooo
[14:47:10] <nFFF> What is it then?
[14:47:18] <nFFF> $('.envelopeColorDetails p')[1] returns an object...
[14:48:20] <`Korvin> hey, I've got a div being dynamically placed to provide a background for a dropdown
[14:48:24] <pootpoot> it should return the dom element
[14:48:35] <Zzaichik> sorry - yeah it should. lol
[14:48:37] <`Korvin> however, when I hover between the list items it gets removed
[14:48:50] <`Korvin> and I'm very confused
[14:49:25] <Zzaichik> I'm guessing you're redeclaring the background on hover
[14:49:32] <`Korvin> no
[14:49:38] <`Korvin> it's a div that's being resized and positioned
[14:49:52] <`Korvin> in the same place I'm removing the dropdowns visibility
[14:49:57] <nFFF> pootpoot it returns it as an object
[14:50:04] <`Korvin> I'm removing the backgrounds, however, it's not actually working
[14:50:11] <aaronmcadam> everything is an object nFFF
[14:50:16] <pootpoot> yes ..
[14:50:21] <`Korvin> the background disappears while the dropdown stays there
[14:50:26] <nFFF> $($('.envelopeColorDetails p')[1]).addClass('foo');
[14:50:30] <nFFF> should work fine
[14:50:34] <aaronmcadam> don't do it that way
[14:50:37] <pootpoot> wow lol
[14:50:38] <`Korvin> only way to reopen the dropdown is to leave hover and go back
[14:50:43] <aaronmcadam> use the jQuery idiom
[14:50:53] <aaronmcadam> use $.fn.eq
[14:50:54] <pootpoot> .eq(1) someone explained above
[14:51:05] <aaronmcadam> yes it was me
[14:51:16] <OriginalUsernm> Anyone know how to get rid of this ugly jumping: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/accordion/default.html
[14:51:22] * aaronmcadam using $.fn.eq for 3 years and still going :D
[14:51:43] <pootpoot> ive used :first-child too
[14:51:48] <pootpoot> or something
[14:52:12] <aaronmcadam> that's sloooow
[14:52:12] <nFFF> I was just responding to the person who said $('.envelopeColorDetails p')[1] doesnt return the element..
[14:52:41] <scorphus> inpho: do you copy?
[14:52:50] <aaronmcadam> pootpoot, selectors are parsed right-to-left try to avoid pseudo selectors where u can
[14:53:06] <inpho> jquery.. anyone know why this may be returning a blank html page with my echoed string http://pastebin.com/n7snXYrH
[14:53:13] <pootpoot> aaronmcadam: isnt that for css selectors?
[14:53:22] <aaronmcadam> what do u think that is in jquery
[14:53:32] <pootpoot> jquery selectors haha
[14:53:32] <aaronmcadam> there's no other way to parse it
[14:53:47] <aaronmcadam> CSS-algorithm based selectors
[14:54:10] <pootpoot> is it any faster or slower to do #parent-div .child-section .thing { } vs .thing { }
[14:54:27] <aaronmcadam> in general, over-qualification is bad
[14:54:30] <aaronmcadam> either do
[14:54:47] <aaronmcadam> $('#parent-div').find('.child-section')
[14:55:00] <aaronmcadam> or just the $('.child-section')
[14:55:08] <pootpoot> ah, i was just talking css there
[14:55:09] <inpho> scorphus:  any ideas ?
[14:55:12] <aaronmcadam> if you don't *need* the qualification
[14:55:21] <aaronmcadam> yeah pootpoot same rules apply
[14:55:21] <scorphus> inpho: you're stuck in the same place
[14:55:28] <inpho> yeah
[14:55:36] <scorphus> did you try form.submit() instead?
[14:55:50] <aaronmcadam> pootpoot: for example, no need to do #container .blah #div
[14:55:52] <inpho> instead of $('#submit') ?
[14:56:01] <aaronmcadam> just #div is all u need
[14:56:06] <pootpoot> i see
[14:56:24] <nFFF> Thats obvious as IDs are unique
[14:56:37] <Zzaichik> Same situation with CSS, over qualification is going to be slower.
[14:56:48] <aaronmcadam> nFFF: not as obvious as u might think for some people
[14:56:53] <pootpoot> ive seen many templates and "boiler plates" with loooong css rules
[14:56:56] <aaronmcadam> pootpoot: this is the best resource for it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS
[14:57:10] <aaronmcadam> all those rules apply to jquery
[14:57:22] <inpho> scorphus:  changed it from .click to .submit
[14:57:30] <inpho> functions the same
[14:57:35] <pootpoot> ill read that
[14:58:27] <aaronmcadam> ok
[14:58:32] <aaronmcadam> so in speed terms
[14:58:42] <scorphus> inpho: did you install firebug and used console.log()?
[14:58:49] <aaronmcadam> its: id > element > class > pseudo selector
[14:58:58] <inpho> scorphus:
[14:59:01] <scorphus> inpho: alsom what browser are you using to develop this app?
[14:59:01] <nFFF> $('.foo').children() is the fastest
[14:59:02] <danieliser> i have a modal that pops up and centers itself.. not working on iphone and ipad.
[14:59:04] <inpho> what am i needing to conole.log ?
[14:59:07] <inpho> chrome
[14:59:11] <nFFF> but that wont select all decendants
[14:59:26] <aaronmcadam> obviously
[14:59:28] <scorphus> inpho: it helps you to debug and identify what is going wrong
[14:59:35] <aaronmcadam> that's why it's called `children`
[14:59:42] <inpho> i am simply trying to get the string from my login2 method
[14:59:51] <danieliser> how can i position an element center of the screen on iphone/ipad?
[14:59:55] <inpho> to be returned into my data return
[14:59:57] <inpho> from ajax
[14:59:59] <aaronmcadam> it would be really inefficient to have a `descendants` function
[15:00:11] <nFFF> isnt that what find() is? :>
[15:00:28] <aaronmcadam> I meant if it didn't take a filter
[15:00:29] <nFFF> ?find
[15:00:30] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:00:37] <aaronmcadam> children can be called with no arg
[15:00:40] <aaronmcadam> args
[15:00:53] <aaronmcadam> at least find enforces a filter
[15:01:20] <aaronmcadam> but anyway, the most important part is the initial set
[15:01:33] <scorphus> inpho: chrome has built-in console
[15:01:37] <aaronmcadam> find, children, etc are gonna be pretty damn fast once the set is already selected
[15:01:41] <nFFF> + speed is never really going to be an issue
[15:01:43] <scorphus> inpho: hit F12
[15:01:54] <nFFF> talking milliseconds :|
[15:01:58] <aaronmcadam> the problem is when you do $('#blah > a > span') shit
[15:01:59] <scorphus> you'll see a "Console" tab
[15:02:24] <aaronmcadam> nFFF these things add up *very* quickly on mobile
[15:02:25] <ch3mical> $('#blah > span') should do the same thing
[15:02:48] <aaronmcadam> what if u just wanted spans within as
[15:02:56] <ch3mical> $('#blah > a span') should do the same thing
[15:03:00] <aaronmcadam> yea
[15:03:02] <scorphus> inpho: console.log() is analog to alert() but much better
[15:03:04] <aaronmcadam> I know that
[15:03:05] <hotchkiss> I'm using jQuery on a project where I need to create an xml doc, pass the data back to the scala backend. my only problem is that $('<thisIsCamelCased />') becaones an element such as <thisiscamelcased') any way to prevent the toLowerCase?
[15:03:10] <ch3mical> It's better to use find though
[15:03:13] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking about selectors I've seen
[15:03:46] <aaronmcadam> people jumped in ancestor selectors like crazy just cuz they could
[15:03:53] <danieliser> how can i center an element to iphone/ipad screen?
[15:03:54] <aaronmcadam> ooh I can use css3 wooo
[15:04:06] <ch3mical> hotchkiss, use XML DOM not HTML DOM
[15:04:31] <ch3mical> danieliser, isn't no different than centering on a desktop computer
[15:04:46] <aaronmcadam> yep
[15:05:08] <aaronmcadam> don't think u can use createElement to create xml dom nodes
[15:05:10] <ch3mical> Or any other media for that matter
[15:05:12] <aaronmcadam> might be wrong
[15:05:38] <aaronmcadam> but pretty sure jQuery doesn't support it
[15:05:53] <danieliser> ch3mical: well with position:fixed it stays at the bottom. same with absolute
[15:06:08] <ch3mical> Because that's what those do
[15:06:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:06:15] <ch3mical> It would do the same thing on a desktop
[15:06:30] <aaronmcadam> danieliser: why are u not using margin: 0 auto
[15:06:37] <danieliser> ch3mical: works fine on anything other than mobile safari
[15:06:48] <danieliser> vertical not horizontal
[15:06:58] <danieliser> this is a modal
[15:06:59] <aaronmcadam> you do know the whole issues around positioning
[15:07:08] <ch3mical> danieliser, I assure you it does not, you just have duped yourself into thinking that because it just by chance lines up the way you expected
[15:07:17] <empireoflight> hey, how can I do this with next/prev buttons instead of the nab that's currently there: http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/FancySlidingForm/
[15:07:20] <ch3mical> If someone loaded that page on a larger screen it would not be where you expect
[15:07:21] <aaronmcadam> ch3mical++
[15:07:21] <danieliser> yes.. and i know there is a workaround for mobile safari not using fixed.. just cant find it
[15:07:28] <ch3mical> Hence the iOS issue
[15:07:28] <empireoflight> *nav
[15:07:37] <ch3mical> iOS uses a different pixel density
[15:07:50] <danieliser> ch3mical lol. i know how to center a div with jquery and window positions.. no problem.. it doesnt work for iphone
[15:07:54] <aaronmcadam> it's cuz it's only a viewport
[15:08:03] <aaronmcadam> the browser sees the positioning model that way
[15:08:07] <danieliser> exactly.. i need to fix it
[15:08:07] <ch3mical> I'm not getting through
[15:08:08] <ch3mical> lol
[15:08:22] <aaronmcadam> hence the ios specific -fixed properties coming thru in ios 5
[15:08:26] <danieliser> ch3mical. im on 1080p monitors.. loads exactly where i want it.
[15:08:39] <ch3mical> danieliser, again, you've missed the point completely
[15:08:43] <danieliser> same all the way down to android..
[15:08:55] <ch3mical> iOS is a different pixel density
[15:08:55] <danieliser> ch3mical  If someone loaded that page on a larger screen it would not be where you expect
[15:08:58] <ch3mical> That's the problem
[15:09:09] <danieliser> i know.. hence the reason i asked for a workaround
[15:09:28] <ch3mical> It's not a "work around' you just need to use the correct technique
[15:09:28] <aaronmcadam> why don't u see how jQuery mobile centres their dialogs
[15:09:34] <Zzaichik> ch3mical is saying you need to redo it the right way.
[15:09:37] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EcgsC/1/ can anyone help me
[15:09:40] <nFFF> this should match?
[15:09:48] <aaronmcadam> match...
[15:09:51] <ch3mical> I'm betting part of the problem is your boilerplate
[15:10:20] <danieliser> me? no boilerplate.. wp theme from woo forest
[15:10:25] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:10:28] <ch3mical> Well there you go
[15:10:31] <Zzaichik> even better
[15:10:32] <aaronmcadam> that's bound to have boilerplate...
[15:10:34] <nFFF> aaronmcadam, have an index of somehing other than -1
[15:10:35] <danieliser> adding functionality over top of a clients theme
[15:10:42] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:10:45] <aaronmcadam> explain urself
[15:11:01] <aaronmcadam> don't just paste a fiddle link
[15:11:18] <Mage_Dude> Interesting note regarding .on(). If you attach it to an element that doesn't exist on DOM load (for example some html that is added to the DOM via an ajax request), the events will never fire even if the elements are added before the .on() method.
[15:11:25] <ch3mical> In any case, this is certainly a question better answered by the CSS experts in #css I'm sure
[15:11:35] <danieliser> so how can i position an element on ipad/iphone properly then?
[15:11:44] <aaronmcadam> Mage_Dude: Makes sense
[15:12:07] <aaronmcadam> Mage_Dude: how could you delegate to a context that will in the future contain a new context that itself will contain elements
[15:12:08] <nFFF> var a = 'TacPro'; a.indexOf('tacpro'); // should be 1?
[15:12:11] <aaronmcadam> inception
[15:12:27] <aaronmcadam> that's not right
[15:12:44] <aaronmcadam> if u want case insensivity use a regex or match
[15:12:49] <Mage_Dude> aaronmcadam: Not really. .ready() loads up some code, I add a few elements, *then* bind something through .on() and the events don't fire
[15:12:51] <aaronmcadam> *with
[15:12:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:13:05] <nFFF> aaronmcadam, can't I just toLowerCase() ?
[15:13:08] <aaronmcadam> that's the point, what's the context
[15:13:15] <aaronmcadam> yes nFFF
[15:13:20] <nFFF> doesn't work..
[15:13:20] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/EcgsC/1/
[15:13:45] <aaronmcadam> looking
[15:14:08] <aaronmcadam> must u include the TM?
[15:14:20] <eugles> heya, is there any clean way without modifying the jQuery source to set the document object that jQuery should use? For example, if the library is running in an iframe, to have it by default use the parent document.
[15:14:22] <Mage_Dude> Even though the elements exist prior to the .on() code, the events never fire. But, if you wrap the eventual content target and use .on() on that element then it will work. That doesn't seem correct.
[15:14:36] <nFFF> aaronmcadam, not in the indexOf method, no
[15:14:41] <nFFF> but it's in the string
[15:15:04] <meph_1> hei, i have a problem with this script here: http://www.thegreendev.com/selectmenu/ - when i change the style and refresh the page. jquery ui select menu is not working anymore. anyone can give me a tip ?
[15:15:05] <aaronmcadam> Mage_Dude: I assure you it's correct
[15:15:12] <kanzie> incredible, I have a leak that has memory usage in Chrome increase from 50MB to 106MB when loading 3MB of data. Running the same test using jQuery 1.4.4 memory increase is from 50MB to 51.2MB
[15:15:27] <kanzie> Wasn't 1.5 when ajax() was re-written to get rid of leaks?
[15:15:38] <Zzaichik> a = a.toLowerCase();
[15:15:39] <aaronmcadam> do u know why nFFF
[15:15:40] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:15:42] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[15:15:45] <Zzaichik> woops
[15:15:47] <Zzaichik> mybad
[15:16:07] <aaronmcadam> nFFF: toLowerCase doesn't mutate the original object

[15:16:37] <nFFF> long day, 11pm and still working
[15:16:49] <nFFF> its when I call in my help credits :DD
[15:16:57] <stevecrozz> I want jQuery to use a document other than window.document, does anyone know if that's possible?
[15:17:04] <Mage_Dude> aaronmcadam: So, .on() correct functionality is that the selector must target an element that exists when the .on() code runs?
[15:17:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's been a long day for me too, 23:16 and i'm here helpin people haha
[15:17:22] <aaronmcadam> Mage_Dude: exactly
[15:17:23] <eugles> stevecrozz: thats my question!
[15:17:32] <aaronmcadam> the context cannot be dynamic Mage_Dude
[15:17:33] <Mage_Dude> aaronmcadam: Ok, so why then when I add the element, then attach the .on() code does it not run?
[15:17:38] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:17:43] <aaronmcadam> read what i said :)
[15:18:06] <nFFF> aaronmcadam are you a developer by day job/
[15:18:11] <aaronmcadam> of course
[15:18:17] <aaronmcadam> what else would i be doin haha
[15:18:50] <aaronmcadam> Mage_Dude: Of course, you could use event binding over delegation but then it won't work for dynamic elements within that given context

[15:20:00] <aaronmcadam> pssh full time of course :p
[15:20:09] <aaronmcadam> used to do freelancing as well as full time
[15:20:09] <nFFF> gutted :<
[15:20:10] <Mage_Dude> I don't see why the element can't be added by jQuery, then have .on() attached. The element is part of the DOM before .on() is called.
[15:20:16] <aaronmcadam> might need to go back to doin that
[15:20:17] <nFFF> yea my flatmate does that
[15:20:26] <nFFF> he makes an extra 5-10k a yr freelancing
[15:20:29] <nFFF> which isnt bad
[15:20:31] <stevecrozz> eugle: looks like the answer is jQuery uses window.document and there's no way to change the document
[15:20:36] <aaronmcadam> but the lifestyle fuckin sucks
[15:20:36] <stevecrozz> anyone know different?
[15:20:51] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:20:56] <aaronmcadam> change the /document/
[15:20:56] <inpho> scorphus:  what should i be looking for in firebug ? the problem is my ajax callback isnt firing
[15:20:57] <xp_prg> is it possible to select a td with a certain value in it?
[15:21:00] <nFFF> tbh its like helping out in here except you get paid :PP
[15:21:00] <aaronmcadam> why would u want to do that
[15:21:10] <aaronmcadam> not at all
[15:21:10] <kanzie> man, I hoped I could take the ajax() object out of 1.4.4 and use in 1.7.1 but it seems to be tricky
[15:21:10] <nFFF> xp_prg sure
[15:21:16] <aaronmcadam> does he consult?
[15:21:20] <xp_prg> with css?
[15:21:29] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: ye what now?
[15:21:45] <kanzie> well, you know the memory-leak I've been struggling with for a week
[15:21:46] <nFFF> no hes actually a designer, so he gets a brief and just works on it at night/weeeknd
[15:21:52] <aaronmcadam> oh god
[15:22:00] <aaronmcadam> have u not asked in jquery-dev
[15:22:07] <aaronmcadam> there's something seriously wrong with ur code
[15:22:20] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: I isolated a test-case in fiddle that showed $.ajax() leaking a lot of memory. Trying it with 1.4.4 show that the leak is code
[15:22:23] <aaronmcadam> does it work ok with 1.4.4 itself
[15:22:35] <aaronmcadam> have u filed a bug already?
[15:22:55] <aaronmcadam> and have u tried 1.7.2beta?
[15:22:59] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: my test-case is nothing more than a simple ajax-call… >1.4.4 leaking 1000% <1.5 leaks 0.3%
[15:23:03] <xp_prg> nFFF I want to select the last column of a table that has a 0 in it
[15:23:18] <aaronmcadam> how can that be
[15:23:19] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: no, the issue list for 1.7.1 does not have anything related to ajax()
[15:23:21] <aaronmcadam> did u file it
[15:23:34] <aaronmcadam> have u annoyed the jquery-dev channel with this
[15:23:39] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: ajax() was re-written in 1.5, I think it behaves better for the most part, but not when loading pure XML
[15:23:39] <Zzaichik> xp_prg:  no, no you can't with CSS.
[15:23:44] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: I have not
[15:23:47] <kanzie> I will now :-)
[15:23:47] <aaronmcadam> why not?
[15:23:55] <kanzie> wasn't aware of its existance
[15:23:57] <scorphus> inpho: paste the current code plz
[15:23:58] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus that's the vector then
[15:24:06] <scorphus> with the form.submit() func
[15:24:08] <aaronmcadam> xml parsing is shit
[15:24:21] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: join #jquery-dev
[15:24:24] <inpho> http://pastebin.com/n7snXYrH
[15:24:28] <aaronmcadam> and get on the bug tracker and file a ticket
[15:24:31] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: yeah. Im thinking 1.5 and above uses $.parseXML
[15:24:40] <inpho> i changed the .click() to .submit()
[15:24:41] <inpho> was the same
[15:24:43] <aaronmcadam> maybe it's a use case thing
[15:24:58] <aaronmcadam> who knows, but just hassle the devs, this is needs fixing
[15:28:13] <ryanneufeld> anyone wanting a good overview of promises should check out this article
[15:28:15] <ryanneufeld> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[15:30:22] <aaronmcadam> goddamn
[15:30:34] <aaronmcadam> return false;  // prevent default form behavior
[15:30:40] <aaronmcadam> destroy this pattern
[15:30:46] <ch3mical> I hate that the complete callback in .animate is called even if the animation is interrupted
[15:30:52] <ch3mical> ugh
[15:31:12] <aaronmcadam> can u use the deferred api instead then
[15:31:17] <aaronmcadam> animate has that
[15:31:28] <aaronmcadam> use a fail callback
[15:31:28] <ch3mical> Hmm I haven't tried it
[15:31:29] <StevenCodes22>  someone wanna tell me if www.stevencodes.com is right on 1024x768
[15:31:39] <aaronmcadam> u what?
[15:31:51] <aaronmcadam> web developer toolbar > change screen size
[15:31:59] <StevenCodes22> nice
[15:32:04] <aaronmcadam> srsly? haha
[15:32:16] <ch3mical> I'm not sure a fail callback would work and as far as I'm aware there's only the complete callback
[15:32:33] <aaronmcadam> read about it
[15:32:55] <charnel> I am generating a form html on click event and cannot fill the form. When I try the fields just got empty.
[15:33:02] <aaronmcadam> ch3mical: http://danheberden.com/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate-2011-02-13/
[15:33:18] <ch3mical> Thanks I'll check this out
[15:33:31] <aaronmcadam> that's an old article
[15:33:40] <aaronmcadam> soz
[15:33:50] <ch3mical> Well apparently this guy knows my pain anyway
[15:33:50] <ch3mical> lol
[15:33:52] <xp_prg> shouldn't this turn all text green? $('table').css(color:'green');
[15:34:10] <aaronmcadam> ch3mical: this should be closer http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/gg723713
[15:34:15] <aaronmcadam> xp_prg: no
[15:34:15] <ch3mical> xp_prg, try 'td' instead
[15:34:40] <nonotza> could someone tell me if I'm doing something wrong: http://pastebin.com/vEtbfhut
[15:34:43] <aaronmcadam> $('table').find('td').addClass('green');
[15:34:52] <StevenCodes22> aaronmcadam: where do i dl its not there?
[15:34:54] <aaronmcadam> please don't use .css() unless u have to
[15:34:57] <xp_prg> why doesn't my approach work?
[15:35:09] <aaronmcadam> ie. dynamically setting heights based off other elements
[15:35:23] <aaronmcadam> xp_prg: cuz of how tables get styled...
[15:35:29] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[15:35:35] <aaronmcadam> google?
[15:35:45] <StevenCodes22> nvm lol
[15:35:52] <aaronmcadam> http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/
[15:35:55] <aaronmcadam> see how hard was that
[15:35:56] <Zzaichik> aaronmcadam: what do you suggest? .attr('style')?
[15:36:01] <aaronmcadam> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[15:36:08] <aaronmcadam> goddammit
[15:36:10] <Zzaichik> Yeah I was going to say..
[15:36:14] <aaronmcadam> separate alll the concerns!
[15:36:18] <aaronmcadam> add a fucking class
[15:36:20] <Zzaichik> just apply a class
[15:36:23] <aaronmcadam> yup
[15:36:49] <aaronmcadam> that;s what I said
[15:36:57] <snover> can I add a regular class and then fucking it later?
[15:37:00] <aaronmcadam> oooh
[15:37:03] <aaronmcadam> yes please
[15:37:05] <inpho> scorphus:  did u get a chance to see it ?
[15:38:01] <xp_prg> ok I have it almost working, how do I select for a td with a 0 in it?
[15:38:16] <Zzaichik> lol
[15:39:21] <aaronmcadam> man
[15:39:22] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:39:32] <aaronmcadam> horrible idea
[15:39:33] <aaronmcadam> :D
[15:39:53] <aaronmcadam> that's what u call eXtreme Programming
[15:41:05] <aaronmcadam> xp_prg: could use .filter() and test the .text()
[15:41:23] <aaronmcadam> but it sounds like u might be doing it wrong TM

[15:44:54] <xaio> Is it possible to run a JSP file via command-line if it has only java code in it and no html?
[15:45:56] <Zzaichik> ...
[15:46:52] <xaio> Zzaichik: as in java <filename.jsp>
[15:48:27] <aaronmcadam> xaio: seriously, asking java questions here will probably get u killed
[15:48:30] <Zzaichik> Couldn't tell you. Maybe ask a Java pro
[15:48:49] <aaronmcadam> xaio: I'm sure the answer is no
[15:48:52] <aaronmcadam> you'd need tomcat
[15:49:00] <Zzaichik> "Isn't it the same?"   ...
[15:49:09] <xaio> I can't join #java its invite only
[15:49:09] <aaronmcadam> or glassfish or whatever the fuckin terrible stack ur using is
[15:49:19] <aaronmcadam> lol
[15:49:26] <aaronmcadam> so you come into #jquery?
[15:49:31] <aaronmcadam> that's warped
[15:49:44] <aaronmcadam> xaio: see if there's a ##java channel
[15:49:58] <aaronmcadam> ## is a convention for unofficial channels
[15:50:02] <Zzaichik> why yes, yes there is
[15:50:26] <xaio> aah i see thanks for the info
[15:50:31] <aaronmcadam> np
[15:50:33] <xaio> jquery is pretty cool too though.
[15:50:38] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:50:40] <aaronmcadam> "too"
[15:50:43] <Zzaichik> lol
[15:50:46] <xaio> hahahahha
[15:50:51] <inpho> can anyone see why this is not triggering the callback? http://pastebin.com/zbVEjwV8
[15:51:00] <aaronmcadam> bullshit :D
[15:51:08] <Guest47869> !rules
[15:51:11] <xaio> a lot of frameworks like gwt use jquery
[15:51:17] <xaio> a lot of ajax
[15:51:21] <JavaLover> guys i'm trying to do this: $(".thecomment").hover(function() {$(this).child().next("div.desc").show("slow");}
[15:51:37] <JavaLover> i have a div inside a div & I want to access the inner div
[15:51:39] <aaronmcadam> great, let me just not use that as a reason to use gwt
[15:51:59] <JavaLover> i know that parent() is a call...but how do I work with children?
[15:52:00] <gnarf> JavaLover: see ?find
[15:52:01] <bot-t> JavaLover, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:52:01] <aaronmcadam> JavaLover: why not just use find
[15:52:18] <JavaLover> that will work for stuff inside the div?
[15:52:22] <JavaLover> i'm a noob that's why i'm not using it lol
[15:52:29] <aaronmcadam> hence ur username
[15:52:33] <xaio> do you use jquery for work?
[15:52:35] <Zzaichik> ^^
[15:52:42] <Zzaichik> about the username..
[15:53:00] <JavaLover> I guess I do..but i'm building my own website
[15:53:08] <gnarf> JavaLover: .find( selector ) - looks for all children of the jQuery object for ones that match the selector
[15:53:08] <JavaLover> i'd work if someone would just hire me lol
[15:53:17] <JavaLover> NICE
[15:53:23] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: did u find an SEO plugin for Chrome that u liked (referring to the old lazyweb issue u filed)
[15:53:26] <JavaLover> can i do like find first? or is that how it works normally?
[15:53:30] <JavaLover> cuz i want the first one it finds
[15:53:39] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: still haven't - no
[15:53:46] <aaronmcadam> I commented the other day
[15:53:50] <gnarf> saw that
[15:53:54] <aaronmcadam> u tried it?
[15:54:09] <gnarf> went and looked at that stuff, didn't ever try it - but forwarded it along to a friend
[15:54:12] <aaronmcadam> it's *ok*
[15:54:14] <neybar_> using chaining, is there a way to do a random inline function?  ex $(this).prev('pp').Command(function()).end()? etc
[15:54:17] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[15:54:22] <aaronmcadam> yay netsplit goooo
[15:54:28] <JavaLover> NETSPLIT FTW!
[15:54:33] <neybar_> using chaining, is there a way to do a random inline function?  ex $(this).prev('pp').Command(function()).end()? etc
[15:54:33] <gnarf> i notices that it didn't seem to be as "friendly" as SenSEO
[15:54:41] <aaronmcadam> what in the fook
[15:54:48] <gnarf> neybar_: see ?each
[15:54:49] <bot-t> neybar_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:54:51] <aaronmcadam> do u mean an anonymous function?
[15:55:02] <aaronmcadam> "random inline function" that sounds mad lol
[15:55:16] <JavaLover> YAYYYY!
[15:55:20] <neybar_> I was actually using each, it just seemed like the wrong thing to do.  I guess I'll keep doing that then.
[15:55:23] <JavaLover> you guys are awesome that totally worked
[15:55:23] <JavaLover> wooohooooo
[15:55:33] <aaronmcadam> JavaLover: If only it had netsplitted u ;)
[15:55:41] <gnarf> neybar_: depends on what the use is - if there is only one element its prolly best to just do each
[15:55:44] <JavaLover> you guys, ty so much!
[15:55:49] <JavaLover> thx for being here & contributing & helping
[15:55:57] <aaronmcadam> it's what we do
[15:56:01] <JavaLover> need to award the duke dollars
[15:56:08] <Zzaichik> *superman pose*
[15:56:12] <inpho> can anyone see why this is not triggering the callback? http://pastebin.com/zbVEjwV8
[15:56:27] <aaronmcadam> explain?
[15:56:30] <JavaLover> i will look into inpho, although i'm a noob but out of the kindness of my heart since everyone just helped me
[15:56:38] <aaronmcadam> that's me done for today
[15:56:39] <JavaLover> I am really good at JAVA but not jquery/javascript syntax for me i'm bad at
[15:57:00] <ch3mical> lol @ Zzaichik
[15:57:06] <MFen`> i'm trying to manually insert some script tags. jquery appears to be implicitly converting them into $.getScript() calls. how do i make it stop doing that?
[15:57:10] <JavaLover> first of all, do you have any errors on that php?
[15:57:16] <inpho> no JavaLover
[15:57:29] <JavaLover> and what exactly is the problem?
[15:57:29] <JavaLover> so i can look for that
[15:57:38] <inpho> i am trying to get that ajax call to work
[15:57:49] <JavaLover> oooo i might know already
[15:57:51] <inpho> it's just returning a white page, with the string echoed out from the function login2()
[15:57:54] <JavaLover> are you calling the ajax from an inner frame?
[15:58:05] <inpho> an iframe ?
[15:58:07] <JavaLover> oh nevermind..that was my issue
[15:58:09] <JavaLover> no i have a div
[15:58:12] <JavaLover> and the div loads a page inside it
[15:58:18] <JavaLover> so I had to reload ajax afterwords
[15:58:25] <inpho> well i do have a template
[15:58:32] <JavaLover> but it's just the 1 page?
[15:58:32] <inpho> that is loading multiple parts of a page
[15:58:32] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 'JavaLover'.replace('Java', 'JavaScript')
[15:58:35] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "JavaScriptLover"
[15:58:36] <JavaLover> like ur not loading a page inside a page inside a apge?
[15:58:40] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[15:58:41] <inpho> the admin/login2()
[15:58:46] <inpho> is a controller/method
[15:58:47] <JavaLover> i hate javascript
[15:58:51] <MFen`> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/555277/ is fetching the urls with ?_=30872308732057 appended
[15:58:52] <Zzaichik> lol
[15:58:53] <aaronmcadam> get the fo!
[15:58:59] <JavaLover> lol i'm just kidding
[15:59:09] <MFen`> which is how getScript does it. also, no new <script> tag appears in the dom when i do this. conclusion: jquery is getting in the way
[15:59:45] <Zzaichik> Show us how your're doing this, MFen`
[15:59:51] <aaronmcadam> right i'm off seeya
[15:59:56] <MFen`> Zzaichik: pastebin above
[15:59:57] <Zzaichik> lates
[16:00:08] <Zzaichik> ah - sorry
[16:00:10] <JavaLover> so wait a min
[16:00:31] <JavaLover> you click submit & what happens? a white blank page
[16:00:38] <JavaLover> no alerts nothing?
[16:00:58] <inpho> well it hits the function
[16:01:01] <inpho> login2()
[16:01:08] <inpho> and it echos out the string
[16:01:08] <JavaLover> does it print?
[16:01:11] <JavaLover> k that's good
[16:01:12] <inpho> and it's a white page
[16:01:23] <JavaLover> can you echo the text? like does it print text at all?
[16:01:27] <inpho> instead of it returning the echoed string to the ajax callback
[16:01:51] <JavaLover> wait wait
[16:01:52] <JavaLover> i see why
[16:01:58] <inpho> ?___?
[16:01:59] <JavaLover> you don't have params set
[16:02:01] <bot-t> inpho, ajax_jsonp_test.htm on Ticket #4734  Attachment  jQuery Core ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/4734/ajax_jsonp_test.htm
[16:02:21] <JavaLover> or you might...but when i call ajax i have to setup params
[16:02:35] <TNA-MichaelK> I want to return some js rendered html with $().post, is that possible?
[16:03:15] <Zzaichik> MFen`:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element
[16:03:33] <JavaLover> is there anyway you can check & see if your param is set?
[16:03:41] <inpho> JavaLover:  i had paras being passed, i just removed them to make the example easier
[16:03:51] <JavaLover> oh ok
[16:04:01] <inpho> so it gets to the function no problem
[16:04:01] <JavaLover> so the params are being passed...but then
[16:04:09] <JavaLover> just not in ur code
[16:04:11] <inpho> and depending on what i pass in
[16:04:12] <inpho> on my form
[16:04:27] <inpho> if i put in john
[16:04:33] <inpho> it echos accordingly
[16:04:35] <JavaLover> here lemme show you something as I don't use jquery to do this but maybe it helps
[16:04:47] <inpho> i'll looked at over 50 examples
[16:04:53] <inpho> and it's like nothing is different
[16:04:56] <inpho> ive*
[16:04:58] <MFen`> Zzaichik: ugh. thanks
[16:05:08] <JavaLover> I use ajax via javascript & this is my call : if(ajaxRequest.readyState == 4 && ajaxRequest.status == 200) {
[16:05:08] <JavaLover> 		alert(ajaxRequest.responseText);
[16:05:11] <JavaLover> ugh
[16:05:22] <Zzaichik> MFen`:  yep. good luck
[16:05:27] <inpho> yeah i'm familiar with that way
[16:05:28] <JavaLover>  if(ajaxRequest.readyState == 4 && ajaxRequest.status == 200) {alert(ajaxRequest.responseText);}
[16:05:40] <JavaLover> yeah this one works for me basically same exact thing ur doing
[16:06:00] <JavaLover> so why is this different from your jquery is my question
[16:06:28] <JavaLover> like are you not recieving the data properly?
[16:06:35] <JavaLover> do you need a readystate?
[16:06:43] <JavaLover> cuz i fi remove that line my code will break
[16:07:01] <inpho> no idea why
[16:07:11] <inpho> every example
[16:07:14] <inpho> shows it just liek this
[16:07:25] <JavaLover> believe me i've read examples
[16:07:32] <JavaLover> most of them are incomplete cuz they're doing "gets" not posts
[16:07:51] <JavaLover> but what do we know, we know it prints
[16:07:51] <inpho> well the difference with jquery is u use $.post
[16:07:53] <inpho> or $.get
[16:08:04] <inpho> or $.ajax
[16:08:07] <inpho> but that wasnt working either
[16:08:26] <inpho> i need that echoed string
[16:08:32] <inpho> to be received by the ajax request
[16:08:39] <inpho> and used for the callback
[16:08:40] <JavaLover> have you tried just using alert("i do reach here"); instead of alert(data)
[16:08:42] <inpho> but that neverhappens
[16:08:43] <JavaLover> to see if it reaches?
[16:08:48] <gnarf> inpho: can you restate the problem?
[16:09:02] <JavaLover> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/zbVEjwV8
[16:09:05] <inpho> look here, http://pastebin.com/zbVEjwV8
[16:09:06] <JavaLover> he's not recieving the ajax request
[16:09:10] <inpho> i have a very simple form
[16:09:16] <inpho> and a jquery ajax post
[16:09:20] <inpho> hitting a controller/method
[16:09:29] <gnarf> whats with the invalid url?
[16:09:33] <inpho> that is accepting a $_POST['user_name']
[16:09:44] <gnarf> you have double quotes and single quotes on the url
[16:09:55] <gnarf> in the $.post() call
[16:10:26] <gnarf> theres a good chance http://yourdomain/'admin/login2' isn't the url you want
[16:10:28] <inpho> sry, i removed those
[16:10:30] <inpho> they still work
[16:10:39] <JavaLover> no dude it is printing
[16:10:40] <MFen`> why is synchronous javascript loading such a clusterfuck anyway
[16:10:40] <inpho> it knows the url
[16:10:42] <JavaLover> the function is going through
[16:10:44] <JavaLover> just not to his ajax
[16:10:57] <gnarf> that makes no sense
[16:11:05] <inpho> i know
[16:11:07] <inpho> pulling my hair out
[16:11:07] <inpho> lol
[16:11:08] <JavaLover> inpho have you tried echo instead?
[16:11:08] <JavaLover> like instead of print?
[16:11:14] <inpho> hmm i can try
[16:11:15] <inpho> sec
[16:11:17] <JavaLover> cuz i use echo " "
[16:11:19] <gnarf> have you inspected the actual request?
[16:11:37] <gnarf> in firebug/chrome inspector?
[16:11:43] <gnarf> also
[16:11:51] <gnarf> you aren't preventing the default on the submit
[16:11:55] <inpho> i did install firebug
[16:12:01] <gnarf> so its still submitting
[16:12:01] <inpho> but i wasnt sure what i was supposed to look for ?
[16:12:03] <gnarf> the form
[16:12:15] <JavaLover> i'm heavily anticipating what happens on echo
[16:12:25] <JavaLover> and also try an alert to see if it even reaches the alert(data) part
[16:12:27] <inpho> yeah i;'ve added this after the jquery submit, event.preventDefault();
[16:12:38] <gnarf> tbh, you should be binding $("#loginForm").submit( function( event ) { ....; event.preventDefault(); } );
[16:12:42] <inpho> echo had no change
[16:12:45] <JavaLover> damnit
[16:12:48] <inpho> loginForm
[16:12:51] <inpho> instead of the submit id ?
[16:13:04] <gnarf> you don't want "click on submit" - you want "submit the form"
[16:13:05] <gnarf> right?
[16:13:11] <inpho> GOT IT
[16:13:14] <gnarf> that also catches pressing enter for instance
[16:13:21] <inpho> i've had the loginForm at one time
[16:13:25] <inpho> but maybe the stupid quotes
[16:13:27] <inpho> or something else
[16:13:29] <inpho> was messing it up
[16:13:30] <sam113101> hi guys, I made tabs (jquery tabs UI), I didn't set a width and it seems like everything is bigger (bigger tabs)
[16:13:35] <sam113101> what is that behavior?
[16:13:39] <inpho> so a combination of all those things we got it!
[16:13:39] <JavaLover> luls
[16:13:41] <inpho> thanks guys
[16:13:45] <JavaLover> nicely done
[16:13:52] <gnarf> $("#loginForm").submit( function( event ) { $.post(...); event.preventDefault(); });
[16:14:33] <gnarf> sam113101: default width of a block level element is 100%?
[16:14:39] <sam113101> yes
[16:14:48] <sam113101> the current width is 100%
[16:14:56] <gnarf> what do you mean "didn't set a width"
[16:15:02] <JavaLover> HEY!!!
[16:15:04] <JavaLover> guys listen
[16:15:10] <gnarf> i don't even think there is a "width" option for tabs
[16:15:15] <JavaLover> i have an idea i might have to talk to freenode but
[16:15:27] <JavaLover> what if people could search irc for coding help
[16:15:42] <gnarf> JavaLover: they already do
[16:15:50] <sam113101> well, a normal div takes as much space as it can, right?
[16:15:52] <JavaLover> how would one do this? like through google
[16:16:01] <gnarf> indexed chat log pages?
[16:16:11] <JavaLover> but how is there like a site on the web?
[16:16:13] <JavaLover> where I can do this?
[16:16:33] <gnarf> http://irc.jquery.com/
[16:16:57] <torm3nt> JavaLover, it's only possible if the logs are available online somewhere
[16:17:18] <JavaLover> but i'd like to search those logs
[16:17:21] <gnarf> but realistically - stackoverflow is a better solution for people who use the web and don't understand IRC
[16:17:26] <JavaLover> this is what i'm saying
[16:17:28] <JavaLover> a way to search all of it
[16:17:31] <gnarf> there used to be a search on those logs, can't find it
[16:17:37] <gnarf> but whatevs
[16:17:41] <JavaLover> man if that was built into google
[16:17:43] <JavaLover> as a side section
[16:17:46] <JavaLover> that'd be a great help
[16:18:07] <JavaLover> because a lot of the time I end up searching for stuff that might not be posted on the web
[16:18:12] <JavaLover> and the irc channel always fixes it
[16:18:12] <gnarf> not really - irc logs are so chaotic that searching them for questions/responses would yield way too many results
[16:18:29] <JavaLover> but if it's the same i mean cmon
[16:18:32] <JavaLover> google gives back 1 billion pages
[16:18:34] <danieliser> how can i get a div centered vertically on iphone screen. works on everything but iOS.
[16:18:36] <JavaLover> doesn't mean we can't sift through
[16:18:38] <dabear> irc is so ten years ago
[16:18:52] <JavaLover> *sigh* fine guess i'll have to login & hope someone is available to answer the question
[16:18:53] <dabear> real men use MSN Messenger nowadays!
[16:18:56] <gnarf> danieliser: not a jQuery question - but assuming it has a width - you can margin: 0px auto
[16:19:11] <gnarf> to center something within its container
[16:19:32] <JavaLover> I just thought it would be nice to find stuff, considering we're constantly answering questions
[16:19:35] <JavaLover> it's better than a forumn
[16:19:57] <gnarf> stackoverflow is pretty damn solid
[16:20:05] <JavaLover> lemme try that
[16:20:22] <JavaLover> oh i have already
[16:20:25] <JavaLover> like a billion times lol
[16:20:30] <JavaLover> i love that site
[16:20:40] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/users/91914/gnarf
[16:21:16] <gnarf> damn, looks ike i might fall out of the top 1% soon
[16:21:58] <dabear> gnarf--
[16:21:59] <danieliser> gnarf: veritcally. and its a modal so its ajaxed in with different content
[16:22:00] <dabear> :(
[16:22:19] <gnarf> danieliser: so you're asking about a lightbox?
[16:22:26] <dabear> danieliser: margins apply to both top and sides?
[16:22:38] <gnarf> why not use one of the existing libraries to handle it?
[16:22:41] <danieliser> dabear: dont know the size till the content loads
[16:23:11] <danieliser> i have built my own and its used quite frequently.. several thousand downloads.. just something i need to work out
[16:23:13] <dabear> danieliser: then set an initial width/height
[16:23:17] <gnarf> also - might want to try asking in #jquerymobile - but TBH - you'll probably never land something centered in the "virtual viewport"
[16:23:33] <dabear> with margin: 0 auto, it will auto expand
[16:23:55] <danieliser> gnarf: tbh i would be ok if i could just get it to position anywhere at all.. other than at the bottom of the viewport/page
[16:24:53] <danieliser> cant even get it at 0 0 with absolute
[16:25:06] <gnarf> sounds like some css issue you're having
[16:25:29] <gnarf> absolute is relative to the nearest relative/absolute parent right?
[16:25:37] <gnarf> so is the div you're positioning inside a relative?
[16:29:11] <berndj> (is there | what is) a favourite plugin that would let me break up a largish dataset into "pages"? all-js solution desired, not one that asks the server for each page
[16:32:46] <gnarf> berndj: define dataset
[16:33:30] <gnarf> berndj: sounds like you should be looking at a "grid" - I've used dataTables to do similar before
[16:35:05] <danieliser> gnarf: its inside the body, body is relative.. worst part is i just tested the demo available on my site and it works perfect on my phone.. so i think your right.. some css is breaking it..
[16:35:22] <danieliser> hardest part is debuging the damn iphone version from a pc.. so disconnected
[16:36:28] <gnarf> danieliser: http://phonegap.github.com/weinre/
[16:39:48] <xp_prg> $('table td:last-child').contains('0').html('test');
[16:39:49] <gnarf> danieliser: you can use an iOS simulator - but its a pain
[16:40:02] <gnarf> danieliser: also - might wanna ask the mobile guys about other remote debugging tools
[16:40:06] <gnarf> cuz there are ways to do it
[16:40:09] <xp_prg> there is a cell with a 0 in it in the last column of the table, why doesn't this work?
[16:40:31] <gnarf> xp_prg: table tr:last-child td
[16:40:42] <gnarf> oh nvm
[16:40:47] <gnarf> got logic wrong
[16:40:59] <gnarf> ?last child selector
[16:41:02] <bot-t> gnarf, :last-child Selector - Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/
[16:41:44] <danieliser> gnarf: one is adobes tool but i dont wanna pay a monthly service for occasional use
[16:42:32] <gnarf> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/25/
[16:42:34] <gnarf> ?contains
[16:42:35] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[16:42:39] <gnarf> ?.contains
[16:42:40] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[16:43:17] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.fn.contains
[16:43:18] <bot-t> gnarf: undefined
[16:43:29] <gnarf> .contains() <-- doesn't exist
[16:43:35] <berndj> gnarf, something in the order of 5000 rows of one-column data. not really concerned with layout
[16:43:51] <gnarf> berndj: look at datatables
[16:44:02] <gnarf> http://datatables.net/
[16:44:19] <xp_prg> got it working!
[16:45:10] <gnarf> xp_prg: might be better to use a .filter( function ) than :contains, unless you want it to also match "500"
[16:45:23] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/GyC72/
[16:45:31] <xp_prg> yup, got it to work with the filter function, I heart you gnarf and its not all platonic
[16:45:37] <someprimetime> how can i combine $input and $textarea's keyup event listeners?
[16:46:05] <gnarf> someprimetime: $input.add( $textarea ).keyup( fn )
[16:46:15] <someprimetime> gnarf: thanks :D
[16:51:25] <sam113101> can someone tell me what's up with my tabs? http://imgur.com/RUlGB,KXjUl#1
[16:51:55] <gnarf> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/GyC72/1/
[16:52:19] <sam113101> gnarf: see, they are bigger
[16:53:15] <gnarf> bigger than what?
[16:53:24] <sam113101> the first screenshot
[16:53:34] <someprimetime> gnarf: nice didn't know you could do find('') and join with the commas
[16:53:57] <gnarf> someprimetime: its a css selector
[16:54:01] <gnarf> :)
[16:54:15] <someprimetime> ah right
[16:54:30] <someprimetime> which is ironic since i wrote that for someone in another room earlier
[16:54:30] <gnarf> someprimetime: i think my empty filter is inverted
[16:54:32] <gnarf> but whatever
[16:54:32] * someprimetime losing it
[16:54:49] <gnarf> sam113101: font-size ?
[16:55:12] <sam113101> I didn't specify any font size
[16:55:20] <gnarf> sam113101: and the demo probably does
[16:55:38] <gnarf> but like seriously? just set a font-size on the container
[16:56:34] <sam113101> also I have a problem
[16:57:00] <sam113101> see on my screenshot, the right "margin" isn't the same as the left margin
[16:57:28] <sam113101> why is that
[16:57:32] <gnarf> sam113101: use firebug, inspect the css and find out why
[16:57:55] <sam113101> when I set the width to 100% it does that, when I don't it's normal
[16:58:14] <gnarf> width:100% is pointless on block elements
[16:58:32] <gnarf> but - width:100% means 100% of its container
[16:58:34] <sam113101> yes, but the bottom thing is a input of type text
[16:58:39] <gnarf> so if the container has padding
[16:58:41] <gnarf> ....
[16:59:02] <gnarf> left padding + 100% + right padding = bigger than the whole thing
[16:59:15] <gnarf> sam113101: so make that display: block if you want it to be "auto wide"
[16:59:38] <sam113101> I don't think you can do that with inputs
[17:00:13] <gnarf> but anyway
[17:00:16] <gnarf> its padding
[17:01:32] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/26/
[17:01:49] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/27/
[17:02:39] <gnarf> note the padding on the input makes the actual width padding*2 + border*2 + width
[17:03:48] <coldhead> If I have an array lol_aids of some unknown number of Deferred objects, how can I pass them all to when()? Would when(lol_aids) do what I want?
[17:04:01] <gnarf> sam113101: http://jsfiddle.net/NmLck/29/
[17:04:29] <gnarf> coldhead: jQuery.when.apply( jQuery, lol_aids );
[17:04:41] <coldhead> oh zuh! many thanks gnarf <3
[17:05:13] <coldhead> wow now my code looks like i know javascript
[17:05:18] <gnarf> coldhead: aye - :)
[17:05:20] <coldhead> time for a pay rise!
[17:05:54] <coldhead> i will put a little shoutout to you in this code, gnarf, which the compiler will utterly remove
[17:06:10] <gnarf> coldhead: when( lol_aids ).done( function( array ) { lol_aids === array });
[17:06:47] <gnarf> coldhead: i kinda hate that it doesn't do that automatically, but it makes sense if you want to $.when( someArray, someDeferred )
[17:07:02] <gnarf> where "someArray" is actually just static data you want to put into that promise
[17:07:13] <coldhead> it's a pretty acceptable solution

[17:15:59] <gnarf> ie8+ has support for unprefixed
[17:16:31] <lakcaj> ie - when the user submits the form, the submit button calls a jquery function to submit the form and update a div with the results, but the file is not being sent with the form data.

[17:43:40] <zanberdo> I'm using jQuery Scroller (http://www.vegabit.com/jquery_scroller/) to scroll some text vertically. The plugin works well, however it assumes that some event is associated with the onmouseover and onmouseout events (either play or pause).  I'm controlling the play and pause through a button and I need to override the onmouse events to nothing (I don't want the mouse over the scrolling area to have any effect). How can I overrid

[17:48:36] <amites> Eviltwin: good point *grin*
[17:48:46] <Eviltwin> Why not just pass the actual element
[17:49:10] <Eviltwin> Why unnecessarily reselect it?
[17:49:23] <Eviltwin> Or have ot break if it doesn't have an ID
[17:49:45] <amites> Eviltwin: That is a snippet from a template loop -- thank you
[17:50:30] <sam113101> hey
[17:51:01] <sam113101> 100% + margin = overflow, but 100% + padding != overflow
[17:51:06] <sam113101> right?
[17:51:55] <Eviltwin> I think that's right, yeah
[17:52:01] <Eviltwin> But it's really a #css question
[18:02:20] <chee> Eviltwin: nothing is *really* a #css question
[18:03:08] <chee> have you ever been in there. it's like covering yourself in orange juice and jumping into a room

[18:03:16] <chee> and kicking the bees
[18:03:37] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I just send people there to make us seem even better by comparison
[18:03:50] <chee> hahaha
[18:03:53] <coldhead> lol
[18:03:56] <coldhead> just like #php

[18:22:25] <Emn1ty> You can probably call the function when an event happens and it should redraw it. Or you can just replace the dom elements. with a $('#foo).html()
[18:22:38] <Emn1ty> or something similar
[18:23:41] <danieliser> gnarf you around?
[18:24:11] <berndj> that's what i'm doing, but it isn't working. somehow i need to tell dataTable, "hey mon, yo data's changed, just re-read it quickly"
[18:25:08] <danieliser> i think its something like oTable.fnDraw()
[18:25:43] <danieliser> gnarf: you around still?
[18:25:50] <berndj> yeah, that's what i thought too [ but it doesn't work]
[18:26:04] <danieliser> got code?
[18:26:25] <danieliser> done a lot of custom work lately having to hack my way through datatables
[18:27:21] <danieliser> ch3mical:you round?
[18:33:47] <pillarlee> hello
[18:33:55] <pillarlee> is there anybody here?
[18:34:05] <coldhead> no one answer
[18:34:09] <coldhead> every be quiet
[18:34:11] <coldhead> pretend you're not here
[18:34:13] <coldhead> SHHH
[18:34:17] <pillarlee> hh
[18:34:25] <pillarlee> i have a question...
[18:34:29] <pillarlee> about jqueryui
[18:34:47] <pillarlee> i wanna use 2 kinds of themes for different widgets
[18:35:11] <pillarlee> for example... A theme for silder and B theme for dialog
[18:35:37] <pillarlee> is there a way to solve this problem?
[18:35:43] <pillarlee> anybody knows??
[18:35:46] <berndj> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/UkHb6/
[18:36:15] <coldhead> pillarlee: you will have to modify the css and use CSS SPECIFITY
[18:36:31] <pillarlee> what means CSS SPECIFITY??
[18:36:54] <coldhead> you might need to google it
[18:37:01] <pillarlee> ok
[18:37:46] <coldhead> but basically if you put the slider in <div id="slider"> and the dialog in <div id="dialog"> then you can add #slider to the CSS selectors in one of the CSS files and #dialog to the CSS selectors in the other
[18:37:56] <coldhead> and they'll only apply to the right things
[18:39:31] <ghostbar> if I have <li><a class='open'>anything</a></li> and I make $('li .open').click( function() { $(this).parent('li')}) it should return me li, right? It returns me null.
[18:39:52] <ghostbar> this returns me <a class='open'...
[18:39:58] <danieliser> berndj: try this instead..http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/add_row.html
[18:40:19] <coldhead> ghostbar: you can't really return from that function ()
[18:40:29] <coldhead> but .parent('li') shoudl select you the <li>, yes
[18:40:44] <berndj> danieliser, it'd be a bit awkward to modify the table through dataTable (but if i have to i guess i have to)
[18:42:04] <danieliser> not really.. if your getting your data from a source then it will either be in an array or json object anyways.. thats how that script accepts the data
[18:42:44] <danieliser> might need to reformat it but that can easily be done by looping the data first to filter/arrange it
[18:42:55] <berndj> danieliser, thing is i already have a chunk of code that puts rows into a table; i just want datatable to re-read the dom
[18:43:12] <berndj> but i've found something that sorta works: fnDestroy + re-setup
[18:44:11] <ghostbar> coldhead: I know, i mean what returns running $(this).parent('li') is null, according to console.log, don't know what I'm doing wrong then :-/
[18:44:48] <danieliser> works but inneficient.. i imagine your need to divert around is based on constraints of the app?
[18:45:00] <coldhead> ghostbar: try $(this).closest('li')
[18:45:14] <coldhead> and if that doesn't work, pastebin the code somewhere in case there's something else going wrong
[18:45:33] <danieliser> try parent('li:first')
[18:46:04] <danieliser> closets could be a child or a parent
[18:46:08] <danieliser> or a sibling
[18:46:55] <danieliser> ghostbar: $(this).parent('li:first') should work.
[18:54:40] <ghostbar> danieliser: , coldhead , thanks, closest worked, parent didn't,  maybe because a is inside a div before getting to li
[18:55:33] <ghostbar> I don't have (nor plan) to make li's as childs of that call, so there's no collision :-)
[18:57:53] <Webb34> hey can anyone give me a hand? I'm trying to get a map to appear using Google's API but when it shows up it doesn't display properly. someone recommended I use google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize'); but I can't get it to work
[18:58:19] <Webb34> the site is at http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/ if you care to look
[18:58:31] <danieliser> try parents()
[18:58:52] <danieliser> ghostbar: try parents() instead of parent()
[18:59:17] <Webb34> to get to the map you have to click "Show Results" then click a hospital name and then go into the Location tab that is generated at the top of the page
[18:59:21] <danieliser> using :first guarantees its the first li parent rather than any possible collision in the future
[19:00:23] <ghostbar> danieliser: that's the one! I thought that would return me an array but returned me the single parent :-D A huge thank you!
[19:00:53] <danieliser> ghostbar: np parent() is more for traversing like next() and prev()..
[19:03:46] <ghostbar> yep, you're right, according to api-doc parent only travels a single level up in the DOM, my bad
[19:06:13] <coldhead> compare with parents()
[19:06:40] <coldhead> but closest is neater because it doesn't travel all the way up the dom
[19:06:48] <coldhead> unless it needs to
[19:11:47] <danieliser> but it can also travel down.. so he cant have a list inside this element.. using parents with :first guarantees he goes up and only to the parent li

[20:05:52] <rtyler> OH
[20:06:02] <rtyler> I think because I set the id to "#foobar" instead of just foobar >_<

[20:38:39] <ndimatteo> hey all, looking for some top solutions/tips to load content on a site only when needed. Site is going to be heavy on content and the use of jquery.
[20:39:00] <b0x> ajax
[20:39:11] <b0x> google.com
[20:39:16] <b0x> now go my child
[20:40:01] <coldhead> lol <3
[20:40:19] <b0x> ;)
[20:40:51] <ndimatteo> haha, I'm aware of google, and ajax, and all that jazz. Just wondering what other people would do. Was considering backbone.js
[20:43:45] <coldhead> backbone is wonderful BUT you want to have a pretty good grasp on how to object orient your elements
[20:44:11] <coldhead> it's hard to go back and change your fundamentals once you've got a lot of code built on it
[20:44:59] <coldhead> ndimatteo: https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate is a good start
[21:16:29] <influx> Looking for a jquery-1.7.1-compatible plugin similar in function to http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/money
[21:17:05] <aqeel> hi room
[21:19:35] <angelazou> hello, I'm writing a simple 2 line script here http://jsfiddle.net/4dqPG/9/
[21:19:45] <angelazou> that gets the value of the selected dropdown option
[21:20:00] <angelazou> and stuff it as the link for a div called tid_row_right
[21:20:23] <aqeel> influx....http://jquerypriceformat.com/
[21:20:42] <aqeel> usually plugins have their own sites
[21:21:00] <angelazou> I don't see any changes in the script when running it, so what's wrong with it?
[21:21:25] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/umUtM/ why does "Jill" show up properly after hitting the ">" and then the "<" but not on the initial load?
[21:22:31] <influx> aqeel: *click*
[21:22:55] <angelazou> anyone?
[21:23:24] <aqeel> yes they have 1.6 compatable and could be with 1.7 too
[21:23:47] <aqeel> they also have prototype version
[21:24:08] <aqeel> on their site
[21:24:09] <aqeel> ATTENTION!! The official jquery plugin site is currently unavailable. Meanwhile, download jquery price format from our site, or fork us in git hub.  jquery.price_format.1.6.js jquery.price_format.1.6.min.js
[21:29:07] <influx> aqeel: Thanks! That's perfect.
[21:29:26] <influx> Seems to work just fine with 1.7
[21:29:46] <aqeel> glad i could be of some help
[21:35:27] <aqeel> angelazou.....your code seems broken
[21:35:53] <coldhead> all code is broken
[21:36:31] <prometh> hi
[21:37:18] <gloomer> hi
[21:37:23] <prometh> $(element).css("background-color");  // returns "rgb(255,255,255)" for Chrome, and "white" for IE8... what can i do?
[21:37:39] <gloomer> about?
[21:38:02] <prometh> the "white" ... i need an rgb or a hex
[21:38:52] <coldhead> prometh: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9874
[21:39:15] <coldhead> they recommend using the jQuery color plugin
[21:39:42] <coldhead> i recommend putting all your colours in CSS and add/removeClass to change them
[21:39:49] <coldhead> but that may not be feasible
[21:39:55] <prometh> "cantfix" :(
[21:40:11] <coldhead> right but there is gnarf's excellent color plugin
[21:41:25] <prometh> how large is it?
[21:41:35] <coldhead> 1k mininifed and gzipped
[21:41:46] <coldhead> i just made that up
[21:41:59] <coldhead> but it's practically that small
[21:42:37] <coldhead> " so the issue is only when comparing the returned background-color to a string, which I imagine would be very rare."
[21:42:41] <coldhead> thanks timmywil
[21:42:43] <coldhead> >: |
[21:42:55] <prometh> where do i find the usable files on github? i can never figure that crap out
[21:43:20] <aqeel> draginx......split your code......javascript into js,styles into css,layout only in html.....will help u long way
[21:43:40] <draginx> aqeel: I fixed it by "shaking" the element upon load
[21:43:58] <Joe_S> prometh: There is a little Icon that says "Zip" in it up the top on the left
[21:44:01] <coldhead> prometh: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.js
[21:44:12] <prometh> coldhead: thanks
[21:44:15] <coldhead> prometh: and here's a nice tute http://gnarf.net/2011/05/14/messing-with-jquery-color/
[21:44:28] <prometh> oh, jquery color isn't automatic? :(
[21:44:43] <gloomer> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-2.0b1.min.js
[21:45:01] <gloomer> still very easy
[21:45:11] <coldhead> that is the older release i think gloomer
[21:46:39] <gloomer> might be
[21:46:41] <gloomer> i dont know
[21:47:09] <gloomer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[21:47:14] <coldhead> that's the guy
[21:47:22] <gloomer> coolz
[21:47:45] <prometh> so, jquery color doesn't extend .css() ?
[21:49:16] <coldhead> no, that would be evil
[21:49:53] <gloomer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/README.md
[21:49:57] <gloomer> seems nice enough
[21:50:02] <gloomer> $.color()
[21:51:30] <EasyCo> What variables are sent by default when to your callback function? i.e: $("div").on("click", "a", customFunc());
[21:52:00] <EasyCo> Which variables will customFunc() have access to? Event, this...
[21:52:20] <gloomer> var x =  $.color($(element).css("background-color"));
[21:52:28] <gloomer> var rgbx = x.rgba();
[21:54:23] <prometh> thanks guys.. color plugin worked
[21:54:30] <prometh> ie8 issued correctd
[21:54:41] <gloomer> cool ie8 is never fun
[21:54:42] <prometh> one last thing... where might I find a minified version of this plugin?
[21:54:57] <aqeel> sameplace
[21:55:04] <prometh> i can't fidn it :(
[21:55:06] <prometh> i hate github
[21:56:01] <tw2113> that's no reason to hate github
[21:56:09] <prometh> it confuses me
[21:56:12] <tw2113> hate it because it makes you realize your code is inferior to everyone else
[21:56:50] <prometh> huh?
[21:56:52] <prometh> i can't find a FILE on github
[21:57:11] <coldhead> prometh: if the project is well set up they will include all the stuff to build your own copy AS WELL AS a prebuilt .js file in the top directory
[21:57:14] <prometh> i'm an interface guy... github's interface is not perfect
[21:57:25] <coldhead> and if it isn't well setup you just file an issue to complain
[21:57:27] <coldhead> USE CAPS
[21:57:27] <prometh> build my own?
[21:57:27] <prometh> with waht?
[21:57:30] <coldhead> AND CALL THEM IDIOTS
[21:57:37] <aqeel> use uglify ....it helps to minimze the code
[21:57:38] <coldhead> like jquery, prometh
[21:57:45] <coldhead> it has a bunch of separate files
[21:57:48] <prometh> i don't "build" js files.. i just write them in a text editor
[21:57:55] <coldhead> and they all get "built" together to produce a single jQuery file
[21:58:01] <coldhead> which is included in the top directory
[21:58:03] <coldhead> same as color
[21:58:12] <coldhead> so you can ignore all that other crap
[21:58:14] <prometh> built with what?
[21:58:20] <coldhead> just find plugin-name.js
[21:58:21] <prometh> yes, i downloaded jquery.color.js
[21:58:23] <prometh> but it's not minified
[21:58:31] <coldhead> right but you can do that yourself! :D
[21:58:36] <coldhead> as part of your own build process
[21:58:37] <prometh> i'd rather have theirs
[21:58:38] <tw2113> build = run a file and it compiles everything with the specified settings and creates the end result
[21:58:41] * prometh opens dojo shrinksafe
[21:58:54] <coldhead> in JS build means using minify or uglify or google closure compiler
[21:59:03] <coldhead> and all kinds of nonsense
[21:59:04] <prometh> ahh
[21:59:07] <coldhead> test suites and such
[21:59:20] <prometh> i like dojo shrinksafe
[21:59:21] <coldhead> but that should all be optional
[21:59:29] <coldhead> right, use that and live long and prosper
[21:59:35] <prometh> thanks
[22:00:22] <ilon_> yes, testing the code is all nonsense.
[22:00:42] <aqeel> got to go ..............bye room
[22:00:53] <aqeel> have nice coding day
[22:00:57] <aqeel> bye
[22:00:58] <ilon_> o/
[22:03:05] <coldhead> man i have had a glorious coding day
[22:03:28] <coldhead> multiple JSONP requests resolved into a single when().then() callback
[22:03:46] <coldhead> AND i learned a valuable lesson about arrays copying
[22:04:12] <EasyCo> http://jsfiddle.net/SqZm4/1/ <-- This doesn't work, I'm trying to send the value of test to the hey function
[22:05:13] <prometh> hmmm, slight issue
[22:05:19] <tw2113> gist of that code coldhead ?
[22:05:30] <tw2113> i'm curious as i work with json/jsonp regularly
[22:05:38] <prometh> by not building from github, the date and version variables are not populated in the header comment
[22:07:31] <prometh> coldhead
[22:10:16] <coldhead> does that matter, prometh ?
[22:10:27] <prometh> i want to know hwat i have, yeah
[22:10:43] <aqeel> hi room
[22:11:07] * tw2113 gives aqeel his seat
[22:11:10] <coldhead> prometh: you'll have to install node.js
[22:11:19] <coldhead> and then run "make"
[22:11:22] <prometh> meh.. ok, nevermind
[22:11:30] <prometh> thought there was soemthing far simpler
[22:11:31] <prometh> thanks :)
[22:11:54] <aqeel> thanks....
[22:12:16] <aqeel> how may i help you...?
[22:12:16] <coldhead> if you're a serious JS dev you already have node install, apparently
[22:13:06] <aqeel> well today its raining here.....hong kong
[22:14:30] <gloomer> meh node
[22:14:42] <EasyCo> Lemme try this again, how would you pass the value of test to hey: http://jsfiddle.net/SqZm4/3/
[22:15:18] <ilon_> aqeel: snow/rain mix here, stockholm sweden
[22:15:29] <prometh> OMG
[22:15:45] <prometh> now IE8 is giving me "medium" for .css("border-top-width")
[22:15:46] <prometh> wtf is that bullshit
[22:16:12] <prometh> it should give me 1px
[22:16:20] <ilon_> its ie.
[22:16:51] <prometh> i know, but i thought jquery was supposed to fix this hideous freak of a browser
[22:17:00] <gloomer> lol, fix ie
[22:17:05] <prometh> :)
[22:17:12] <gloomer> like thats possible
[22:17:22] <Cork> EasyCo: http://jsfiddle.net/SqZm4/4/
[22:18:05] <EasyCo> Cork: .call!!!!
[22:18:15] <Cork> call isn't strictly needed
[22:18:18] <prometh> YUI doesn't have this problem apparently, gloomer
[22:18:25] <Cork> its just so you can pass the "this" variable
[22:18:55] <Cork> EasyCo: http://jsfiddle.net/SqZm4/5/ would work too
[22:18:56] <ilon_> prometh: jquery does patch some flaws, but its like fixing peace in the middle east, not possible.
[22:19:41] <Cork> EasyCo: the magic is in the anonymus function
[22:20:05] <EasyCo> So I need to chuck it in an anonymous function in order to pass it local variables?
[22:20:12] <Cork> yes
[22:20:18] <Cork> else you can't pass parameters
[22:21:00] <EasyCo> Cork: So what's the .call for exactly?
[22:21:13] <Cork> ?mdc call
[22:21:15] <bot-t> Cork, call - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[22:21:27] <Cork> ?mdc apply
[22:21:28] <bot-t> Cork, apply - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[22:22:18] <Cork> EasyCo: its so you can do this.id in hey
[22:28:10] <EasyCo> Cork: Awesome, thanks for the input
[22:28:27] <Cork> np
[22:33:14] <EasyCo> Cork: just to clarify, this is beyond my original question, how would you access the this from addClick in function hey if you were using this example: http://jsfiddle.net/SqZm4/4/
[22:33:50] <Cork> "this
[22:34:01] <Cork> it actaully sets the this variable
[22:34:10] <EasyCo> Ah!
[22:34:28] <Cork> if you don't use call or apply, this will be window in hey
[22:34:37] <Cork> as in this === window
[22:36:05] <Cork> EasyCo: so using call there means hey will work the same way as if you did .on('click', hey)
[22:36:36] <EasyCo> Cork: Gotcha, now I understand properly.
[22:36:52] <EasyCo> Cork: Pretty useful thing to know. Thanks heaps.
[22:37:00] <Cork> ya it is
[22:37:15] <Cork> EasyCo: es5 has .bind and it would solve this even nicer
[22:37:34] <Cork> but it doesn't exist in all browsers (mainly <ie9)
[22:37:53] <EasyCo> es5 bring?
[22:37:56] <Cork> and as ie9 doesn't work on winxp its a feature you can't really use
[22:38:07] <Cork> ECMAScript 5
[22:38:13] <Cork> ?mdc bind
[22:38:15] <bot-t> Cork, bind - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Creates a new function that, when called, itself calls this function in the context of the provided this value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function was c... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[22:38:31] <Cork> EasyCo: don't confuse it with jquery .bind, it has no relation
[22:38:45] <EasyCo> Cork: Figured as much
[22:41:53] <EasyCo> Awesome stuff.
[22:42:39] <Es0teric|AFK> doesnt .on() do the same thing as "bind"?
[22:42:45] <prometh> does ie9 have these issues?
[22:43:00] <prometh> like the color plugin requirement and "medium" for border-width ?
[22:43:02] <Es0teric|AFK> oh snap we got a IE9 user...
[22:43:34] <prometh> nah, i avoid microsoft products
[22:43:45] <prometh> but i do have it on a vmware that i never open
[22:44:23] <Es0teric|AFK> IE browser is garbage...
[22:44:38] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: on is a combind command for delegate, live, and bind
[22:44:39] <Es0teric|AFK> Microsoft should just give up and load all PC's with just Firefox
[22:44:47] <Cork> Es0teric|AFK: so no it does't
[22:44:59] <Es0teric|AFK> i see, Cork
[22:45:07] <prometh> firefox is bloated, but it's still good
[22:45:14] <Cork> prometh: ie9 is the first ie that supports function.bind
[22:45:29] <EasyCo> Cork: Bind doesn't work for DOM stuff generated on the fly
[22:45:35] <Cork> but winxp can't run ie9
[22:45:36] <EasyCo> Oops
[22:45:41] <EasyCo> I didn't mean to write that to you Corck
[22:45:46] <Cork> :)
[22:46:00] <Cork> well bind works for that too
[22:46:06] <Cork> but you have to bind the element as you add them
[22:46:31] <Cork> and depending on how you write your .on it doesn't support that either
[22:46:42] <Cork> (if it uses the bind syntax it doesn't)
[22:47:51] <EasyCo> Cork: Fair enough, won't see me debating you about it!
[22:48:20] <Cork> EasyCo: heh basically it all depends if the element you bind the event on exists or not :)
[22:57:59] <EasyCo> Cork: If you use call does it overwrite all other references to this within a function?
[22:58:31] <mindis|wurk> nice. firefox refuses to insert multiple br tags with inserthtml
[23:00:30] <coldhead> its probably been programmer by dudes who hate <br> tags
[23:00:36] <coldhead> programmed*
[23:01:15] <mindis|wurk> it does work when done in the middle of text but not between a <strong> and <h1>
[23:02:02] <mindis|wurk> writing RTEs is such a pain with all these browser differences
[23:02:18] <mindis|wurk> and i don't even need to care about IE :D
[23:03:38] <Cork> EasyCo: this works inside the function like it normally does
[23:03:41] <Cork> no difference
[23:11:56] <EasyCo> Hey Cork, one more question for you please mate, then I'm done promise
[23:12:26] <EasyCo> Cork: Does a the click event propagate to functions within it?
[23:16:10] <EasyCo> Cork: For example: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4WFr/
[23:16:22] <EasyCo> Cork: I always thought I had to pass the event variable along with the function
[23:16:40] <Cork> no
[23:17:09] <Cork> and your code is broken in another part too
[23:17:22] <Cork> your using function declarations before the function exists
[23:17:36] <Cork> var name = function(){}; has to happen before its called
[23:17:44] <Cork> function name() {} doesn't have to
[23:17:56] <EasyCo> Yah it's a function expression
[23:18:43] <EasyCo> But I always thought that the code would run through it first because it's only triggered on a click vent
[23:20:30] <EasyCo> So are there any other variables sent along without being explicitly declared other then event?
[23:21:16] <EasyCo> And here I thought I was starting to get a hang of it :p
[23:29:47] <Cork> EasyCo: uh.. i think you niss understood
[23:30:05] <Cork> EasyCo: no variable in the local function scope is passed along
[23:30:26] <Cork> so if you don't pass the event variable it won't know about it
[23:30:46] <Cork> only variables its garanteed to have access to is global ones
[23:31:08] <Cork> niss==miss
[23:31:09] <EasyCo> Cork: So why does the following example work? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4WFr/2/
[23:31:38] <Cork> it doesn't
[23:31:39] <Cork> "event is not defined"
[23:31:51] <EasyCo> Works in Google Chrome
[23:32:05] <Cork> then its cause they have a global event object
[23:32:08] <Cork> window.event
[23:32:32] <Cork> prob to work around bugs with ie code
[23:32:35] <EasyCo> Yah just tested in other browsers
[23:32:39] <EasyCo> No go
[23:32:45] <EasyCo> Thank god, I thought I was going crazy
[23:33:06] <EasyCo> Chrome is so forgiving
[23:33:23] <Cork> EasyCo: when you want to test standard complience gecko is most of the time the best browser to use
[23:33:37] <Cork> the others always has a more pragmatic approch
[23:33:44] <Cork> "whats needed to make the web work"
[23:34:06] <EasyCo> Cork: Cool, I'll keep that in mind, I just ditched FF due to massive mem usage but I'll use it more often to test JS stuff
[23:34:42] <Cork> EasyCo: uh.. ff10 is actually marked as the most memory efficient browser in latest tests >_>
[23:35:15] <EasyCo> Ok you got me, I stopped using it at FF8 I think..
[23:35:22] <Cork> :)
[23:35:32] <Cork> they've been working on memory usage since ff6
[23:35:42] <Cork> and its been steaily declining
[23:35:51] <Cork> *steadily
[23:36:01] <EasyCo> Good stuff. Hey just out of curiosity. Where are you located?
[23:36:08] <Cork> sweden
[23:36:45] <tw2113> it feels regressed in Fx12 at the moment, but you know
[23:36:58] <EasyCo> RIght on. Thx again for the help.
[23:43:33] <EasyCo> Finally got it all to work properly. (bow)
