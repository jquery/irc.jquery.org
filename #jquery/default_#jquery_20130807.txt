[00:56:48] <iwantolearnjquer> hi.. im learning jquery just now. and im on click function. it is normal that you can only click once ? im using textilate.js also for animaltion. i want to do is when i click again it replay the animation?? sorry for my bad english hope someone can help
[01:04:42] <jned> I have an event handler: $("#saveUsernameDialog").click(function(){ that is activated when a button is pressed beside an <input type="text" id="saveUsernameDialog"> but I also want to trigger this same event handler if the user hits ENTER on the input box. do I need to make two same repeated functions with the different triggers or can I put them together somehow?
[01:05:32] <jned> I guess I have to make two separate one, one with the .click() handler and one with the .keypress(function(e) if(e.keyCode===13){...
[01:07:52] <jned> at least I can separate the two body functions, and just call them in each of the two callbacks
[01:09:56] <Aquaword> hi, why I get undefined here? http://pastie.org/8214448
[01:29:13] <Cork> Aquaword: are you setting the correct content-type header from php?
[01:29:27] <Cork> (application/json)
[01:29:43] <Aquaword> Cork: i needed this line: data = eval('('+data+')');
[01:30:05] <Cork> Aquaword: no
[01:30:14] <Cork> that is a sign that your server is doing it wrong
[01:30:36] <Aquaword> hm
[01:30:37] <Cork> Aquaword: do <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?>
[01:30:47] <Cork> before you do the echo
[01:30:54] <Cork> and then jquery should do the correct thing
[01:31:04] <Cork> Aquaword: also, NEVER use eval to parse json
[01:31:20] <Cork> there is JSON.parse and $.parseJSON those are safe to use
[01:32:17] <gonnarule> hi all
[01:32:31] <Aquaword> Cork, yepp I solved on server side
[01:32:45] <Aquaword> thx
[01:32:48] <Cork> np
[01:33:33] <xec> hi gonnarule!
[01:40:18] <Krambiorix> how can i create two decimals (1000,00  and 110,20) and summate them?
[01:40:44] <Cork> 1000.00 + 110.20 ?
[01:41:26] <Cork> the rounding will have to be part of the presentation though
[01:46:13] <VipConsult> I think I found a bug in the autocomplete jquery. It seems to be case sensitve when you search the begining of a string
[01:46:24] <VipConsult> this is the data : [{"label":"Test Company 1, Manager Address\nbh88as","value":"Test Company 1"},{"label":"Test Company 2, Adres 1 \nbh8","value":"Test Company 2"}]
[01:46:32] <spobat> hi
[01:46:44] <spobat> if i call .html() I only really get the "innerHTML" right?
[01:46:49] <spobat> meaning the html of all children
[01:46:54] <VipConsult> but when I type 'com' - it doesn;t show anything
[01:47:05] <spobat> so, should i call .parent.html() if i want the element itself too?
[01:48:08] <spobat> ok, i use outerHTML
[01:59:04] <Cork> spobat: outerHTML isn't cross browsers
[01:59:41] <Cork> spobat: so the only safe way to do it (for now) is $('<div/>').html(.parent().clone()).html()
[02:00:09] <spobat> ok
[02:00:29] <Cork> good news is though that it should be safe to use outerHTML in ~6months or so
[02:02:48] <Whirl3d> does this syntax work?  count===0||count<10 && return;
[02:03:03] <spobat> is this sensible? $('#submit-smiley-content ul:nth-child(3)').children(':last-child').remove()
[02:03:13] <spobat> ps: yep it works, but it looks a bit suboptimal
[02:03:31] <spobat> Whirl3d: && is stronger than ||
[02:03:55] <spobat> considering how you set your spaces, that was not expected
[02:05:22] <gonnarule> hi guys, I have a problem with loading some jquery file (jquery.validate.js) into our liferay Portal. The theme we use loads jquery-1.8.2.js and the jquery.validate.js, along with others javascript files. Jquery and others scripts works, but the functions defined in jquery.validate.js doesn't. If I inspect generated code by the portal, we see our js files (including jquery.validate.js), can open the file and read the code.
[02:05:31] <VipConsult> jquery - autocomplete has a bug , when you search for "com" it doesn't send a request
[02:05:37] <gonnarule> Fact is if we write jquery.validate in console, undefined is returned
[02:05:47] <gonnarule> we're kinda lost.
[02:05:59] <Whirl3d> spobat, thanks. I think I get that.
[02:11:44] <Guest33112> hi
[02:12:33] <Guest33112> why isnt the  .footer-on-off-section appearing and disappearing on click on #footer-on-off-button  in http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/
[02:12:44] <shahin8r> pskli: hello, mate. :)
[02:13:15] <xec> Whirl3d: && will only evaluate the left hand side if it is false (and || only if true)
[02:13:21] <shahin8r> pskli: got bad news. offset are still incorrect, even after all the images are loaded
[02:13:33] <pskli> shahin8r: hi !
[02:13:51] <xec> Whirl3d: so, it will "work" depending on what you want it to do... ;)
[02:14:06] <shahin8r> pskli: here's the code: http://pastebin.com/1gAiB68j
[02:14:24] <Whirl3d> xec, I wanted to do if (count===0||count<klen) return;
[02:14:42] <Guest33112> its quite obvious to work. but dont know why its not
[02:15:32] <xec> Whirl3d: that's a lot more more readable, don't you think?
[02:15:39] <Whirl3d> xec, I was just trying to practice that alternate syntax...I figured someone like yourself or spobat would have more info for me. Thanks.
[02:15:47] <Whirl3d> for sure.
[02:15:48] <pskli> shahin8r: then I'm lost sorry :/
[02:16:01] <xec> Whirl3d: but yes, i believe they would do the same
[02:16:02] <pskli> is this happening in every browser ?
[02:16:12] <Cork> Guest33112: you can't animate display
[02:16:51] <Guest33112> Cork, why not
[02:17:00] <Guest33112> Cork,  display is just another property
[02:17:08] <shahin8r> pskli: yep
[02:17:29] <Cork> Guest33112: cause it has no inbetween states
[02:18:27] <Cork> Guest33112: http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/2/
[02:19:50] <Cork> Guest33112: to animate an element you need to animate height/width or opacity
[02:20:01] <Cork> display will just snapp state
[02:20:39] <Cork> Guest33112: an option would be to just animate the height of the footer instead
[02:20:55] <Guest33112> hm
[02:22:58] <Guest33112> Cork,  i want the "about us" to stick on the right bottom corner of page. no footer dive from left to right of the page. just the about us button on right. when clicked. it expands to left showing the sections
[02:23:33] <Guest33112> Cork,  so I should use  $('#footer span').hide(); ? and  $(".footer-on-off-section").slideToggle();     or something else?
[02:23:34] <Cork> Guest33112: that would make it even simpler
[02:23:47] <Guest33112> Cork,  mMm. can figure out how
[02:23:50] <Cork> just have an extra div for the options
[02:23:56] <Guest33112> hm
[02:24:02] <Cork> and when you toggle change the width of the element
[02:25:41] <Guest33112> Cork,  let me try
[02:27:22] <Cork> Guest33112: something like http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/3/ ?
[02:27:46] <Cork> hmm even better http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/4/
[02:27:56] <markd1985> Hello, can anyone help with a jquery/ajax problem?
[02:28:42] <Cork> ?ask
[02:28:43] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:28:49] <markd1985> I have a form that posts with ajax, in my console in the network tab it says okay when I post the form and in the header for that post it shows everything as normal, here is my stack overflow question
[02:28:51] <markd1985> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18092296/why-does-posting-form-with-ajax-plugin-give-result-in-console-but-not-post-the-f
[02:31:45] <Guest33112> Cork,  yes. similar !but i wonder why my code dont work?  = http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/5/
[02:32:46] <Guest33112> Cork,  dont want to change the height though
[02:32:52] <markd1985> Anyone?
[02:34:38] <Cork> Guest33112: http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/6/
[02:36:03] <Guest33112> Cork,  hm. thx., why wasnt mine working?
[02:36:57] <Cork> Guest33112: 1. you had height: 15px, so the element never showed
[02:37:15] <Cork> 2. you had no overflow restriction set on show-hide, so it didn't affect the content
[02:37:27] <Cork> 3. it wrapped so the element changed height
[02:37:48] <Cork> and it was initially full size so it was backwards
[02:38:05] <Cork> Guest33112: also, use booleans when you want booleans not number
[02:38:12] <Guest33112> hm
[02:38:14] <Guest33112> thanks
[02:38:34] <Cork> you might also want to animate the height of the element
[02:41:00] <Cork> Guest33112: http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/8/
[02:42:26] <Guest33112> Cork,  thannks!
[02:42:49] <Guest33112> Cork,  dont wanted to change the height of anything though
[02:46:24] <Guest33112> Cork,  why the footer expands in height on click?
[02:48:14] <Guest33112> Cork,  may be the height of spans.
[02:48:25] <Guest33112> Cork,  may be the height of spans that make it grow.
[02:48:30] <fireboot> Guest33112: are you sure you want that much animation?
[02:49:53] <fireboot> I mean, there is too much happening here :P
[02:50:07] <Guest33112> am.. I depict a menu on right float. with a + and - sign changing. theres not footer wide starting from left to right. but when the menu is clicked. the footer expands to left showing the content inside it.
[02:50:20] <fireboot> why don't you just animate the height?
[02:52:59] <Guest33112> fireboot,  i dont want the footer to increase in hieght
[02:52:59] <Guest33112> fireboot,  i dont want the #footer to increase in hieght
[02:59:40] <gonnarule> any idea why jQuery.fn.validate returns undefine when we actually loads the jQuery.validate.js file ?
[03:00:03] <Guest33112> fireboot,  Cork  heres what I have reached. But with problems. I dont want the height for footer to increase. 2. the blue colored footer dive should be as size of the text "menu" and should expand to left on click. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/10/
[03:00:14] <Guest33112> fireboot, Cork  any ideas?
[03:02:41] <fireboot> lemme have a look
[03:03:08] <fireboot> your code does not run
[03:03:08] <Guest33112> k
[03:03:13] <fireboot> check the console
[03:03:19] <Guest33112> it does.
[03:03:31] <fireboot> no it doesn't :). It seems that the footerOn declaration got removed
[03:03:33] <fireboot> for some reason
[03:03:45] <Guest33112> http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/10/
[03:04:03] <Guest33112> did you checked this http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/10/  <----\
[03:04:11] <Guest33112> did you checked this http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/10/  <----|
[03:04:55] <fireboot> Guest33112: the footerOn variable is not declared in your fiddle
[03:05:25] <fireboot> but that's ok I can add it myself
[03:05:47] <fireboot> http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/11/
[03:10:02] <Guest33112> fireboot,  still the #footer increases its height
[03:10:11] <fireboot> yeah I'm digging into it
[03:10:12] <Guest33112> fireboot,  I dont want the height for footer to increase. 2. the blue colored footer dive should be as size of the text "menu" and should expand to left on click.
[03:14:39] <fireboot> Guest33112: the problem with the height changing
[03:14:59] <fireboot> is due to the fact that the div show-hide takes the whole width
[03:15:37] <Guest33112> hm
[03:15:41] <fireboot> do you know about the developer tools in your browser?
[03:15:54] <airdem> var foo = function(bar) {stuff} ----------- foo();
[03:16:02] <airdem> whats inside bar now?
[03:16:15] <airdem> or how do i check that its empty?
[03:16:35] <Guest33112> fireboot,  its width: "100%" onClick.   it should take account of the "Menu" dive
[03:16:58] <fireboot> Guest33112: I don't know why it behaves like this, I'm trying to understand
[03:17:09] <fireboot> but I can guarantee you that this div takes too much space
[03:17:11] <Hobbes`>  I want to trigger some actions when a checkbox is clicked.. the code works only when checkboxes in the original HTML is clicked.. but clicks on checkboxes rendered using jquery are ignored...
[03:17:15] <fireboot> to fit on the same line as "above us"
[03:17:20] <fireboot> about*
[03:17:27] <Hobbes`> how does one make it monitory/react to clicks on jquery created/inserted html too?
[03:17:49] <fireboot> Hobbes`: I think I ran into a similar problem
[03:17:51] <fireboot> recently
[03:18:16] <Hobbes`> I get the feeling it's because I'm adding the bind in $(document).ready()
[03:18:29] <fireboot> wait I'm digging in my code
[03:19:24] <Hobbes`> fireboot thanks :)
[03:19:45] <fireboot> ok so basically the problem I ran into was that for some reasons I couldn't react on events on elements added dynamically
[03:20:29] <Hobbes`> yup that describes my situation too
[03:21:15] <fireboot> http://pastebin.com/8uSJVraw Hobbes`
[03:21:20] <fireboot> read the comments
[03:23:23] <fireboot> I couldn't do simply something like $("#frame").hover(...) because #frame itself was added dynamically, so basically I needed to use .on() instead
[03:23:40] <fireboot> (or at least that's what I understood, and it works :P)
[03:23:46] <Hobbes`> fireboot .on can be used for click/change too right?
[03:23:52] <fireboot> yes
[03:23:57] * Hobbes` is a jquery n00b
[03:24:00] <fireboot> just specifly the event through the first parameter
[03:24:02] * fireboot too
[03:24:06] <fireboot> specify
[03:24:06] <Hobbes`> thanks .. will test it out with my code
[03:25:14] <Cork> Guest33112: make the divs inline-block instead of block
[03:26:05] <fireboot> Guest33112: back to your problem
[03:26:17] <Guest33112> Cork fireboot ,  working on it. will show you code soon
[03:27:11] <fireboot> cool
[03:27:31] <fireboot> Hobbes`: have you read the link my comments give?
[03:28:44] <Hobbes`> fireboot yes reading it
[03:29:10] <fireboot> what you are interested into is the 2 paragraphs starting from "vent handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on()."
[03:29:18] <fireboot> what you are interested into is the 2 paragraphs starting from "Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on()."
[03:29:40] <fireboot> especially the second paragraph
[03:31:18] <jammanbo1> If I am in an AJAX success callback, is there some way I can reject() and deferreds which might be triggered? I have a broken API which will not be fixed, and sometimes I need to simulate an error even though the response code might actually be 200.
[03:31:33] <jammanbo1> reject() any* deferreds
[03:33:26] <baz> Hey, I have an extionsion method to return json objects on post. This works but I have now tried to add statuscode handeling. 302 however does not trigger the status check function. Firebug returns the 302 -> 200 redirect but does not trigger the function

[03:35:51] <Guest33112> Cork,  fireboot  this is what I wanted. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/12/     I do want to get rid of line 12. width: "50px"    as I want the width #footer to auto fit to the text in it  (+Menu in this case) and I might want to add more div by Javascript on runtime on the left of +Menu
[03:47:16] <Quest> Cork,  fireboot  iam guest. changed nicks
[03:47:49] <fireboot> :D
[03:48:02] <fireboot> I'll have a look at your code
[03:48:07] <Quest> ok
[03:49:02] <Cork> Quest: why not just do something like http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/13/ ?
[03:50:22] <fireboot> also you should consider using {width: 'toggle'}
[03:50:28] <fireboot> that would simplify greatly your code
[03:51:12] <niels_> Hi - what would be the best way to select all lists after a certain object from an ajax response? I'm trying this atm: var pagination = $(data).find('table').nextAll("li");
[03:51:20] <Quest> Cork,  nice but need the footer to expand to match page width
[03:52:21] <Quest> fireboot,  you mean replace line  12 with width: "toggle" ?
[03:53:04] <fireboot> well
[03:53:15] <fireboot> the idea would be to first write the html/css to display things the way you want
[03:53:35] <fireboot> and they you can use animate({width: 'toggle'}) to give it the animation you want
[03:54:02] <fireboot> right now in your code Quest
[03:54:07] <fireboot> if I remove completely the JS
[03:54:10] <fireboot> then things don't work
[03:54:28] <fireboot> the buttons are not shown at all
[03:56:12] <Quest> fireboot,  click this 2 times http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/14/
[03:56:37] <fireboot> of course
[03:56:43] <fireboot> that's because you animate #footer
[03:57:01] <fireboot> if you animate width with toggle on #footer
[03:57:07] <fireboot> then it will completely disappear the second time
[03:57:28] <fireboot> or maybe I misunderstood something
[03:57:47] <fireboot> actually why do you animate #footer at all?
[04:00:08] <fireboot> I  can't help you more Quest though, I'm still a sucker myself
[04:01:45] <Quest> np
[04:04:30] <Cork> Quest: how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/15/
[04:08:36] <sojic> Can I grid 80/20 with jquerymobile?
[04:10:24] <niels_> Hi - what would be the best way to select all lists after a certain object from an ajax response? I'm trying this atm: var pagination = $(data).find('table').nextAll("li");
[04:11:24] <Cork> niels_: that would work if they are all siblings
[04:13:46] <Cork> if they arn't you would have to do something like var list = $(data).find('table, li'); list = list.slice(list.index('table'));
[04:16:59] <Quest> Cork,  nice. why does the menu text tingles?
[04:17:22] <niels_> Cork - thanks. That almost gives it as I want - that gives the last list before the table, but I need all the lists after the table:)
[04:21:26] <VipConsult> jquery - autocomplete has a bug , when you search for "com" it doesn't send a request to the source url
[04:21:28] <shahin8r> I'm using Flexslider and somehow my offset.top of my divs give incorrect value when document.ready or even on window.load. But if I use setTimeout(500) on it everything is ok. Any solution to this besides setting a settimeout value?
[04:21:56] <Quest> Cork,  fireboot  did it!  :) http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/16/     what do you think?
[04:21:59] <raj> VipConsult, can you fiddle that?
[04:22:18] <fireboot> for some reason the text disappear
[04:22:26] <fireboot> s
[04:22:42] <fireboot> once the div is extended
[04:23:24] <fireboot> but that might a problem local to me, that's not the first time I run into disappearing spans :p
[04:24:11] <pierlooqup> is this the right channel for jquery mobile related questions?
[04:24:54] <Quest> fireboot,  did you saw http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/16/
[04:25:08] <fireboot> yes
[04:25:10] <fireboot> but I mean
[04:25:18] <fireboot> the animation works fine
[04:25:19] <fireboot> but
[04:25:23] <fireboot> once the animation is over
[04:25:25] <fireboot> the spans disappear
[04:25:51] <fireboot> in other words, the spans are visible only when opening/closing the div
[04:26:29] <fireboot> also, you might want to add a call to .stop(true, true) before every call to animate()
[04:30:38] <pierlooqup> i have a problem with jquery mobile's  collapsible

[04:31:46] <Cork> Quest: check out the link i have you a while back nr 15
[04:32:55] <e01> how can i wrap inner element from container
[04:33:00] <Cork> Quest: the code i gave you should be a bit more stable, as i did away with the floats
[04:33:34] <Cork> e01: container.prepend(container.children().wrap('div')
[04:33:35] <e01> i mean if i have <a><b /><b /><b /></a> i wana make them <a><c><b /><b /><b /></c></a>
[04:33:48] <Cork> * container.prepend(container.children().wrap('div'))
[04:34:12] <VipConsult> raj, did you get the message on private ?
[04:36:52] <e01> Cork: this work just like wrap()
[04:37:15] <Cork> e01: what do you mean?
[04:37:29] <Cork> ah, right wrap will wrap each element indivitually...
[04:37:31] <Cork> forgot that
[04:37:44] <Cork> e01: try container.children().wrapAll('div')
[04:38:41] <e01> Cork: last one works, thank you
[04:39:00] <Quest> Cork,  nice. why does the menu text tingles?
[04:39:26] <Cork> thingles?
[04:39:36] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[04:39:44] <airdem> How do i save the content of a dialog+events(etc) and load it back into the displayed dialog again?
[04:40:10] <Cork> Quest: ah... missed that
[04:40:18] <Cork> Quest: looks like a chrome rendering bug
[04:40:26] <Cork> bah....
[04:40:39] <Cork> Quest: btw your example fails quite badly in firefox
[04:41:31] <Cork> that rendering error is... weird...
[04:42:20] <Quest> Cork,  iam using firefox and 16 edit goes fine
[04:42:52] <Cork> Quest: change the width of the window then
[04:43:14] <Cork> where it overflows and the menu drops out after the animation
[04:43:39] <Cork> actually, i get the same in chrome
[04:43:42] <Quest> Cork,  ya. you are right 16 fails in firefox
[04:44:08] <Quest> Cork,  whats the cause of it.  (droping)
[04:44:27] <VipConsult> a problem with autocomplete: portal.vip-consult.co.uk login : admin , pass: aaaa , the search box uses autocomplete. it seems case sensitive for some keywords, for example 'Com' one result , 'com' no results
[04:45:13] <VipConsult> if you  access the source url it returns the correct data for both keywords , but autocomplete doesn't fetch it.
[04:49:36] <sojic_> I'm using jqueryMobile... I have link which open panel. But I want to "attach" extra code as well (ex: open panel and fill in the form with value)
[04:50:29] <dannii> Hello dear fellas, I was thinking of using jQuery UI for my laravel website but dunno how to install it, anyone that knows?
[04:51:58] <Quest> what is the jQuery equvalent to  document.getElementById("footer").offsetWidth;
[04:52:32] <dannii> I guess its ur footer width lol
[04:54:13] <Quest> dannii,  i mean jquery syntax
[04:56:13] <Whirl3d> $("#footer") will give you jquery wrapped around the footer element. I suppose you could do $("#footer")[0].offsetWidth;
[04:56:27] <Whirl3d> that's id='footer'
[04:56:42] <Whirl3d> if you want the document footer, it's just $("footer")
[04:56:45] <niels_> Cork - any ideas? That almost gives it as I want - that gives the last list before the table, but I need all the lists after the table:)
[04:57:24] <Quest> Whirl3d,  so $("footer").width() would do or     $("footer").offsetWidth?  whats the difference?
[04:59:20] <shahin8r> Sorry for repeating but I can't get this to work. I'm using Flexslider and somehow my offset.top of my divs give incorrect value when document.ready or even on window.load. But if I use setTimeout(500) before getting offset value, everything is ok. Any solution to this besides setting a setTimeout value? Can show live site in PM.
[05:02:51] <dannii> Hello dear fellas, I was thinking of using jQuery UI for my laravel website but dunno how to install it, anyone that knows? sorry for repeating :/
[05:06:07] <sammich> sudo apt-get install jquery-ui
[05:08:20] <Quest> Cork,  firefox bug is gone. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/21/      how can I get rid of line 21?
[05:09:16] <jop008> I have a subtile color background issue http://picpaste.de/Screen_Shot_2013-08-07_at_2.05.30_PM-OScYcZoN.png the code looks the same I looked for color in the syles but no clue this is the code  http://pastebin.com/kKx45hpZ
[05:09:30] <Quest> dont want to specify a width. instead want it to be auto configured according to content it in.
[05:11:47] <dannii> sammich im using win7 :)
[05:12:21] <niels_> Okay I changed some things and it is now selecting the very last list item, but I'd like to select all <li> things after the table. Still using this: list = $(data).find('table, li'); list = list.slice(list.index('table')); - any ideas on how to select them all?
[05:12:57] <sammich> why are you selecting them all?
[05:13:02] <sammich> you already have them all...
[05:13:11] <niels_> I want them all after the table
[05:13:16] <niels_> Not the ones before the table
[05:14:34] <sammich> sorry, missed that :)
[05:20:42] <Cork> Quest: the example i gave you did away with that
[05:21:25] <Quest> Cork,  yes. but it had a tingle of text on chrome. it was nice though but problem with chrome
[05:21:41] <Cork> Quest: ya, but that was the removal of the floats
[05:22:00] <Cork> the part with the fixed dimentions was a separate part
[05:22:13] <gonnarule_lunch> Hi guys
[05:22:21] <Quest> Cork,  let me see
[05:22:25] <Cork> Quest: and your menu is still broken
[05:22:38] <Cork> the last menu option isn't visible when it's expanded
[05:23:22] <haiQt> Hey guys, does anyone know how I can pass a constructed string as a single variable to a Handlebars helper? I have a helper that renders social icons with two variables (message and url), but I need to construct the URL based on other Handlebars variables in the template
[05:23:31] <haiQt> For example: {{social --'this is a ' foo.bar-- 'http://google.com'}} where the part between -- should be one string that is the message variable in the helper
[05:24:14] <gonnarule_lunch> anyone got any clue why jQuery.fn.validate returns undefined despite the fact the jquery.validate.js is loaded in the <head> section
[05:24:25] <Quest> Cork,  its broken in http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/21/ ?
[05:24:32] <Cork> yes
[05:24:37] <gonnarule_lunch> i.e. some function defined in a javascript file isn't loaded
[05:25:17] <Quest> Cork,  http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/21/     your page width might be less.
[05:25:33] <Quest> Cork,  expand the page. it shows up. the last one is "contact us"
[05:25:38] <Cork> Quest: ya, but you still have a lot of free space on the left
[05:26:46] <Quest> Cork,  yes because its floated right
[05:26:46] <Ortund> so I'm writing my 2nd ever plugin... it's going to provide buttons that allow me to swap code samples on my page between languages, and it'll also have a "back to top" button
[05:27:33] <sammich> niels_: http://jsfiddle.net/QHhYE/
[05:27:58] <sammich> no idea how expensive that is
[05:28:56] <shahin8r> Sorry for repeating but I can't get this to work. I'm using Flexslider and somehow my offset.top of my divs give incorrect value when document.ready or even on window.load. But if I use setTimeout(500) before getting offset value, everything is ok. Any solution to this besides setting a setTimeout value? Can show live site in PM.
[05:28:58] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/SsG2YTUG ... problem is on line 20... I'm getting an "Unexpected Identifier" error from Chrome when I load the page that has this on... I'm not sure why I'm getting it though, can anyone help me?
[05:29:44] <sammich> Ortund: chrome tells me exactly what the problem is..
[05:29:45] <Quest> Cork,  cant cope up. line 22 http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/21/
[05:30:00] <Quest> Cork,  sory. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/23/
[05:30:16] <Ortund> sammich, that the "Object [object Objet] has no method 'swaptop' ?
[05:30:39] <Ortund> don't know how to fix that either, I thought that error came as a result of the "Unexpected identifier"
[05:30:48] <sammich> -Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token -
[05:30:55] <xec> niels_: $("table").nextAll()
[05:31:11] <sammich> dammit, I was looking for that method
[05:31:35] <Ortund> unexpected token? where? O_o
[05:31:53] <sammich> var code-button, line 20, as you said
[05:32:36] <xec> sammich, niels_ : in any case, that html is invalid, the only child element of a <ul> is <li> (not <table>)
[05:32:38] <Ortund> I see nothing wrong with that line... vars are allowed to have - characters in them...
[05:32:45] <niels_> xec / sammich - I'm sorry for the confusion, the html is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QHhYE/1/
[05:33:14] <xec> niels_: and what exactly do you want the end result to be?
[05:33:23] <sammich> xec: yeah, I know, I had a twinge when I wrote that in, then I wanted to see how Chrome handled it, and saw that it did, then promptly forgot I put a table in a list
[05:33:36] <xec> niels_: $("table + ul > li") ?
[05:33:48] <niels_> xec: I want to select the <li> items that appear after the table
[05:34:13] <xec> or, alternatively; $("table").next().children()
[05:34:22] <sammich> does jQuery do the smart thing and run that whole query natively?
[05:34:27] <Ortund> xec, you could have <ul><li><table></table></li></ul> though if you really had do...
[05:34:47] <xec> Ortund: yes, the difference between children and ancestors is vital ;)
[05:35:05] * Ortund makes notes about ancestors
[05:35:12] <sammich> $('* *')
[05:35:26] <sammich> hmm, does that blow things up...
[05:35:43] <xec> looks like a smiley with a single big ear
[05:35:50] <Ortund> sammich so where's my unexpected token... I think I'm experiencing change blindness or something because I very literally can't see it :(
[05:36:41] <xec> niels_: that html is invalid too btw
[05:36:52] <xec> niels_: an ID must be unique ;)
[05:37:02] <sammich> meh
[05:37:04] <Krambiorix> hi i have a draggable inside a div with overflow-x:scroll.... The draggable can't be dragged outside this div.... Anyone?
[05:37:17] <sammich> $('[id=eyedee]')
[05:37:19] * xec is now known as htmlnazi
[05:37:38] <sammich> Ortund: http://cl.ly/image/1e103z0Y143p
[05:37:43] <niels_> xec: Sorry - I'm new to jquery, how would I select that from data? It's an AJAX response - $(data).find('table').next().children(); or something?  (heh and yeah, quick copy/pasting stuff in the jsfiddle :p)
[05:37:44] <xec> sammich: i think $("* *") should work, would select anything that has a parent element
[05:38:13] <xec> niels_: same way.. $(myHtmlString).find("table").next().children()
[05:38:15] <sammich> yeah, I had hoped it would be more crazy than it was
[05:38:27] <xec> niels_: assuming there is only one table
[05:38:27] <airdem> .hasClass('offer, note, file') is this legit?
[05:38:50] <sammich> I think it's space?
[05:38:54] <Ortund> sammich, I know you said line 20, but I don't understand what the problem on that line is... the variable name code-button ?
[05:39:02] <xec> niels_: depending on what 'data' contains, of course
[05:39:31] <niels_> There's only one table yes :) data is the ajax html response
[05:40:19] <sammich> Ortund: have you actually run that code?
[05:40:21] <xec> niels_: then that should (in theory) work
[05:40:24] <sammich> you can't use - in a var name
[05:40:53] <Ortund> sammich, yes, I'm testing it on my live site now
[05:41:24] <sammich> xec: I'm a single quote nazi
[05:41:41] <niels_> xec: Meh, sadly it doesn't, heh- undefined
[05:42:01] <xec> sammich: so you're single? and likes to quote nazis?
[05:42:15] <sammich> nien
[05:42:39] <xec> niels_: try setting a breakpoing and verify exactly what the 'data' var really is
[05:42:40] <Ortund> what do I do when my button clicks do nothing, but no errors are reported in my browser?
[05:42:47] <xec> breakpoint*
[05:43:01] <xec> Ortund: have some coffee?
[05:43:55] <xec> shahin8r: do you have a live demo?
[05:43:56] <Ortund> does it count if I'm allergic to caffeine?
[05:44:21] <shahin8r> xec: I have a live site, I'll PM it if it's ok
[05:44:23] <sammich> a teaspoon of tabasco
[05:44:33] <niels_> xec: That should be the same as console.log(data) right? When I do that it is the complete html response, doctype, head, body (and the table / lists :))
[05:44:39] <Cork> Quest: just throwing this out there, do with it what you like http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/25/
[05:45:02] <Cork> Quest: opps forgot to clean up the js http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/26/
[05:45:34] <xec> niels_: ok, good. then try console.log($(data).find("table").length) to see if it's able to find the table (should be 1 if there's a table)
[05:47:23] <Krambiorix> anyone?? i have a draggable inside a div with overflow-x:scroll.... The draggable can't be dragged outside this div....
[05:47:44] <Quest> Cork,  wow. thats just 3 lines of code. what does it do?
[05:47:51] <Cork> Quest: check the css
[05:48:21] <Cork> it isn't perfect in any way or form
[05:48:32] <sammich> only if you plan on supporting like ie10+
[05:48:33] <Cork> but if your interested in going that route you have a starting point
[05:48:52] <sammich> or does 9 have css transitions?
[05:49:01] <Cork> nope
[05:49:06] <sammich> wait, it has it with the ie-tag?
[05:49:14] <sammich> I was reading something about this recently
[05:49:18] <dannii> Hello dear fellas, I was thinking of using jQuery UI for my laravel website but dunno how to install it, anyone that knows? im using windows sorry for repeating :/
[05:49:22] <niels_> xec: Weird, gives a 0 - if I try to select something in the table (tr) it does give a correct (not 0) response
[05:49:40] <Cork> sammich: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition#Browser_compatibility
[05:49:44] <sammich> hmm, it's 10
[05:50:08] <xec> niels_: can you copy/paste the contents of data into a jsfiddle?
[05:50:19] <Cork> but honestly i don't think animation is important enough to have workarounds for old browsers
[05:50:54] <Cork> (at least not menu animations)
[05:51:46] <sammich> I wish there was an Object map-like iterator
[05:52:00] <airdem> $(el).html('').append(copy, move);
[05:52:00] <sammich> and I wish Array.map had an iterator as an arg
[05:52:08] <airdem> appends move into copy and not into $(el)
[05:52:09] <Cork> sammich: whats wrong with $.each or $.map ?
[05:52:13] <airdem> is that normal behavior?
[05:52:29] <sammich> trying to use less jQ
[05:52:59] <sammich> although, that said, that mightn't hurt
[05:53:05] <sammich> using the util funcs
[05:53:07] <Cork> airdem: only if copy is the same element as el
[05:53:10] <Cork> so no
[05:53:29] <Quest> Cork,  you said its not a proper way?
[05:53:35] <airdem> copy and move a two seperate <a>
[05:53:37] <Quest> Cork,  see this . http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/24/ too.
[05:53:48] <airdem> but tstill the second a gets into the first
[05:53:52] <Cork> Quest: it is, but it isn't fixed up to not be buggy
[05:54:49] <Cork> Quest: the animation of the footer, can be too fast/slow and cause rendering problems with the menu
[05:55:37] <NetQT> Hi there
[05:55:58] <NetQT> could someone say how is it possible to detect of horizontal scroll reached the end?
[05:56:12] <niels_> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/3g4pG/
[05:56:45] <Cork> NetQT: scrollTop() + height() >= scrollHeight()
[05:57:40] <xkr47> that's vertical scroll
[05:57:59] <NetQT> sorry Cork, but will it vork for horizontal scroll??
[06:00:07] <Quest> Cork,  what do you think about http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/24/
[06:00:38] <NetQT> I use scrollLeft() to detect its position, but I don't know whether it reached it's end
[06:02:35] <xec> NetQT: try scrolling 1px more and if the position changed, it's not at the end
[06:02:46] <xec> (then you can scroll back 1px)
[06:03:26] <NetQT> hmmm, good idea, thanks, I will try now
[06:07:39] <NetQT> THANK YOU xec, saved me again :)
[06:12:09] <gonnarule_lunch> anyone got any clue why jQuery.fn.validate returns undefined despite the fact the jquery.validate.js is loaded in the <head> section ?
[06:12:42] <gonnarule_lunch> jquery.validate.js define $.fn.validate
[06:14:01] <xec> niels_: i'm not sure what's wrong, seems to work in the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/3g4pG/2/
[06:16:08] <xec> niels_: ooh, maybe it's because the html is invalid, looks like there's a part of the code that looks like this: "<tbody<tr>"
[06:19:20] <niels_> xec: :o well that was indeed a typo - fixed that.. console.log($(data).find("table").length); still gives 0 though, weird
[06:20:12] <Quest> Cork,  disturbing you again. why cant i do this http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/27/   ?
[06:22:35] <xec> Quest: what did you expect that code to do?
[06:22:54] <grafi> very solid question xec
[06:22:56] <grafi> oô
[06:23:29] <Quest> xec,   grafi  :)
[06:23:46] <xec> i was being serious... :(
[06:24:03] <Quest> I wanted to animate what     $('#footer').toggleClass('hide-menu');  does
[06:24:23] <xec> hehe, well. you get points for creative code i guess
[06:24:32] <xec> but nope. can't do that.
[06:24:35] <xec> not like that anyway
[06:25:00] <xec> .animate() expects an object literal with property names and what values to animate to
[06:25:36] <xec> (as opposed to a random piece of jquery code)
[06:26:01] <niels_> ooh xec
[06:26:11] <niels_> I placed a div around it, now it finds the table
[06:26:18] <xec> Quest: if you want to transition between the states of two different classes, css transitions has a nice way to do that
[06:27:49] <Quest> xec,  oh. the css way? it has problems with old browsers
[06:28:08] <xec> i wouldn't call it "problems"
[06:28:19] <Quest> xec,  thats why I came to jQuery. by the way why I cant do what I wanted to
[06:28:21] <grafi> in old browsers it just wouldnt animate?
[06:28:23] <grafi> or not?
[06:28:26] <xec> rather, lack of support - yes. but that just means the animation won't run - who cares
[06:28:31] <grafi> its not like it breaks things
[06:28:34] <xec> you still get the end states
[06:28:43] <grafi> if you're using ie5.5 go fuck you ^^
[06:28:47] <Quest> grafi,  hm.
[06:29:21] <Quest> xec,  ok. I didnt understood the .toggleClass thing. can you tell briefly what it does?
[06:29:21] <grafi> you will only miss ie8/9
[06:29:40] <xec> Quest: if the class is present, remove it - otherwise add it
[06:30:31] <Quest> xec,  hm
[06:30:54] <grafi> Quest xec its an interesting visual effect xd http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/28/
[06:31:22] <xec> lol
[06:31:25] <xec> that is awesome
[06:31:35] <Quest> xec,  whats rem in  max-width: 5rem;
[06:31:43] <xec> root ems
[06:31:55] <grafi> isnt that your code Quest?
[06:31:55] <grafi> oô
[06:31:57] <xec> the same as "em" except based on the font size of the root element
[06:32:09] <grafi> way cooler than em <.<
[06:32:12] <xec> yeah
[06:32:21] <xec> but not as well supported
[06:32:32] <Quest> grafi,  most is. not all
[06:32:40] <sojic> Anybody to give me directions for jquerymobile
[06:32:44] <grafi> especially if you have been burned before "why the fuck is the text so tiny ._."
[06:32:44] <sojic> ?
[06:32:54] <grafi> goto jquerymobile.com?
[06:33:03] <sojic> o... thank I didn't know that
[06:33:11] <grafi> >.<
[06:33:23] <grafi> and it doesnt even exist
[06:33:26] <sojic> you were so helpful
[06:33:42] <grafi> well
[06:34:00] <xec> jquerymobile.com doesn't exist?
[06:34:08] <grafi> i guess i mistyped
[06:34:15] <grafi> whatever
[06:34:18] <grafi> :P
[06:34:41] <xec> it was loading so slowly i was beginning to wonder myself, lol
[06:34:47] <grafi> sojic im sure if you ask an actual question someone less shitty than me could at least attempt to help you
[06:34:56] <grafi> yeah thats it xec :P
[06:35:02] <sojic> OK... Let's try:
[06:35:15] <gonnarule> ah !!
[06:35:16] <gonnarule> guys
[06:35:29] <Quest> xec,  grafi  so which one do you recomend. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/29/    or   http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/30/      which is more in control and feature addable?
[06:35:43] <gonnarule> when a js file define some methods with $.fn.[nameOfMethod]
[06:35:57] <gonnarule> can I access it with jQuery.[nameOfMethod] ?
[06:36:30] <gonnarule> I mean, I have some $.fn.validate in a file, and can't access it with jQuery.fn.validate, but i can with $.fn.validate
[06:36:36] <gonnarule> isn't $ just a shortcut ?
[06:36:44] <sojic> I have link which open panel <a href="#panelId" data-id="mycustomid">... the panel is triggering (open/close), but I want to add custom code to handle my data-id. I have $('.class a').live('tap', function()) with simple cosole.log, but it do not trigger.
[06:37:00] <grafi> Quest with the css you divide your codebase into js and css, which could be a contra
[06:37:21] <Quest> grafi,  contra?
[06:37:25] <grafi> Css is probably more efficient (just dont quote me on that)
[06:37:35] <xec> Quest: both of those seem buggy to me
[06:37:47] <grafi> disadvantage?
[06:37:53] <grafi> downside!
[06:37:54] <grafi> :D
[06:37:55] <Quest> xec,  you dont have a preference?
[06:37:57] <Quest> grafi,  ok
[06:38:11] <Quest> grafi,  other than separate css / js. any other reason?
[06:38:25] <grafi> i would seriously ask myself if I really needed any kind of animation on a menu
[06:38:36] <xec> Quest: use the best tool for the job - I can't answer you when i don't know the prerequisities
[06:38:40] <pierlooqup> i have a query mobile collapsible that on android "browser" fires twice on tap
[06:38:45] <pierlooqup> *jquery
[06:38:45] <xec> what the hell did i just spell
[06:39:02] <xec> prerequisites?
[06:39:04] <xec> is that right?
[06:39:04] <pierlooqup> can anyone suggest what could be the cause?
[06:39:07] <Quest> xec,  I really dont know the future implication of which tool is best for the shown job
[06:39:29] <Quest> xec,  prerequisits
[06:39:33] <xec> lol
[06:39:39] <Quest> xec,  prerequisites  is correct.
[06:39:41] <xec> i think that's even worse than my attempt
[06:39:48] <xec> yeah i think so too
[06:39:52] <grafi> prepreprepsquites
[06:39:54] <grafi> oô
[06:39:55] <grafi> :D
[06:39:55] <xec> Quest: anyway, for simple transitions, I'd stick with css
[06:40:19] <Quest> xec,  I may add or delete thing in footer, change the animation later. etc
[06:40:21] <grafi> why is the menu on the bottom of the page anyways?
[06:40:33] <Quest> xec,  I may add or delete thing in footer at runtime by JS dom, change the animation later. etc
[06:40:49] <Quest> grafi,  because the main menu is on the top
[06:40:51] <Quest> :)
[06:41:02] <xec> grafi: so you don't have to lift your leg so high to click it with your foot
[06:41:46] <Quest> xec,  grafi so  which is more in control and feature addable?
[06:42:25] <grafi> why have 2 menus?
[06:42:33] <grafi> are they the same?
[06:42:33] <grafi> :p
[06:42:40] <Quest> grafi,  no.
[06:42:54] <grafi> so if have to scroll all the way down if i want a specific link?
[06:43:20] <xec> it's fixed
[06:43:21] <Quest> the top one is also fixed on top. but its not about why 2 menus. its about the footer only :)
[06:43:49] <xec> no scrolling required. (tm)
[06:43:57] <Quest> yes
[06:44:07] <grafi> well ok, still i have to travel from top to bottom of the screen ;)
[06:44:07] <grafi> im lazy
[06:44:14] <xec> you need a smaller screen :)
[06:44:17] <grafi> anyways of to sports
[06:44:20] <niels_> xec: fwiw - Wrapped it around a div and adding it like this: var pagination = $(data).filter('#searchpagination').children();
[06:44:22] <Quest> I  asked serously :)
[06:44:23] <niels_> Seems to work :)
[06:44:26] <grafi> xec, i need a bigger screen - 2 of them
[06:44:27] <grafi> !
[06:44:42] <Quest> xec,  grafi  thanks! brb
[06:44:49] <xec> niels_: glad you got it sorted
[06:45:44] <niels_> xec: Yeah :) Thanks for the help
[06:46:39] <xec> *afk*
[06:52:02] <gonnarule> what's the use of : (function($) { please ?
[06:53:43] <Quest> Cork  hi, just for understanding sake.  so which one do you recomend. http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/29/    or   http://jsfiddle.net/fvPcv/30/      which is more in control and feature addable?
[07:01:19] <Cork> Quest: it's not very easy to say one or the other; they do both have there up sides and downsides
[07:01:51] <Cork> Quest: i my self go more and more for declarative animations, as that gives hardware accelerations
[07:02:38] <Cork> Quest: when it comes to limitations, declarative animation can't ever be a feature rich as functional animations
[07:02:48] <Cork> but then comes the question, do you need it?
[07:14:05] <Inazad> Hi there, how to get a select dropdown with checkboxes ? Like theses on the searchbar : http://comfree.com/
[07:14:54] <Cork> Inazad: my faking the box though js
[07:17:40] <Inazad> so its a javascript question right ?
[07:17:43] <Inazad> or jquery ?
[07:26:08] <airdem> $(a.one, a.two).click(function() { return false });
[07:26:32] <airdem> somehow a.two does not get affected by .click
[07:26:35] <radditz> hello
[07:26:55] <radditz> what does the function $( ) that takes an argument a function do?
[07:28:20] <airdem> i have two vars containing jquery objects. how do i set the same event for both?
[07:28:21] <Cork> airdem: by $(a.one, a.two).click(function() { return false }); do you mean $('a.one, a.two').click(function() { return false }); ?
[07:28:57] <Cork> radditz: it's a short hand for $(document).ready()
[07:29:10] <airdem> Cork, sorry my fault. but in my case the selector contains vars containing a jQ obj
[07:29:12] <radditz> Cork: I see, thank you
[07:29:29] <radditz> do binding have to be made there?
[07:29:32] <radditz> when document is ready?
[07:29:40] <Cork> airdem: jqObj1.add(jqObj2).click()
[07:29:47] <airdem> thanks
[07:29:48] <Cork> radditz: yes
[07:30:01] <Ortund> okay, so I've got most of my plugin working: http://pastebin.com/Z2YXCsKW
[07:30:03] <radditz> Cork: I see, thank explains why none of my binding worked, thank you very much
[07:30:45] <Ortund> the way it's got to work is that it's supposed to hide a set of code samples on my page and show another... problem is that on page load, it's not hiding anything on page load
[07:31:54] <Ortund> line 30 in the paste is where it's supposed to hide one set... I can't figure out why it isn't
[07:32:46] <Ortund> probably should mention the code blocks are loaded in the dom before this executes... not sure if that helps
[07:32:46] <Cork> Ortund: have you checked if he selectors match any elements?
[07:33:16] <Ortund> Cork, yes. The button clicks work
[07:33:22] <Cork> no not on clicks
[07:33:30] <Ortund> but the clicks use the same selectors
[07:33:42] <Cork> add debug code in the plugin and see what it does on line 33 and down
[07:34:12] <Cork> Ortund: one thing i see is $(".csharp") vs $(".c-sharp")
[07:34:24] <Cork> and $(".vb") vs $(".visual-basic")
[07:34:28] <kinder> if I use jQuery to append a new element, I can't do a click function on it?
[07:34:35] <Ortund> ya
[07:34:46] <Cork> kinder: you can
[07:34:53] <Saaether> `api on @ kinder
[07:34:53] <b-ot> kinder: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:35:13] <Ortund> $("c-sharp") abd $(".visual-basic") are the buttons... $(".csharp") and $(".vb") are the code blocks
[07:35:18] <Cork> kinder: how and where matters though
[07:35:36] <Cork> Ortund: ya, but like i said, add debug output in the plugin and check what fails
[07:35:59] <Cork> it's impossible to tell why a dead code dump doens't work in some unknown environment
[07:36:23] <Cork> Ortund: or make a fiddle where the code actually works, where the error is visible
[07:36:33] <Ortund> I can link a page that uses it for you?
[07:36:40] <Cork> fine
[07:36:48] <Ortund> http://loganyoung.za.net/software/articles/forms-authentication-in-asp-net/
[07:36:55] <Ortund> just a lot easier than making a fiddle
[07:37:22] <Cork> for you ya, for the one helping, no
[07:37:41] <Ortund> didn't think of that
[07:39:15] <Ortund> hmmmm
[07:39:48] <Cork> Ortund: you have a script that highlights the script after your switcher
[07:39:48] <luciash> hi all
[07:39:56] <Cork> it ignores if the section is hidden or not
[07:39:59] <Cork> and shows it again
[07:40:48] <Ortund> so I need the switcher to work after the highlighter
[07:40:54] <Cork> ya
[07:40:55] <gonnarule> hi there
[07:41:08] <Krambiorix> i have a draggable inside a div with overflow-x:scroll.... The draggable can't be dragged outside this div.... anyone any suggestions?
[07:41:11] <gonnarule> anyone know is (function($){ can be replaced by something else ?
[07:41:30] <Cork> Ortund: it's easy to see, just put a breakpoint on line 77 in the script file and see that the sections are hidden just fine
[07:41:46] <Cork> then click play and they show again
[07:41:57] <Inazad> Hi there, how to get a select dropdown with checkboxes ? Like theses on the searchbar : http://comfree.com/
[07:42:52] <gonnarule> Inazad : did you look at their code ?
[07:43:07] <Inazad> I don't find it, the javascript sources and css too
[07:43:27] <luciash> i must be utterly stupid but i do not get how do i trigger a click on loaded element which is rendered to DOM after page is loaded... tried $(document).on("load", function() { $(".cke_button_maximize").click(); }) and several variations but none works :(
[07:43:31] <gonnarule> Inazad : use chrome, shift+ctrl+i, and the code is in front of you
[07:43:50] <gonnarule> Inazad : btw they just use <div> with <input checkbox> in it
[07:44:40] <luciash> can anybody tell me what am i doing wrong ?
[07:45:34] <luciash> (what i want to do is simply trigger the maximize icon click when CKEditor is loaded)
[07:45:36] <Inazad> gonnarule, but how they do the fake list
[07:46:05] <Saaether> luciash http://jsfiddle.net/sxpYQ/
[07:46:53] <Ortund> Cork, seems I fixed it
[07:47:08] <MarkyC> How can I insert a table row after the pink rows in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/WG6Uz/ I think I'm using insertAdjacentHTML() wrong
[07:47:13] <luciash> Saaether: that one is easy, but i need it on load, not on click
[07:47:28] <Ortund> set a delay on the hide of the code blocks I don't want to see
[07:48:13] <gonnarule> Inazad : shouldn't be a problem, you get 10 div with checkbox in it, you css them to be one upon others, you hide them all, and when you click one particular div, you show them all
[07:48:34] <Saaether> `demo @ luciash
[07:48:34] <b-ot> luciash: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:49:45] <gonnarule> anyone know if there is a difference between : (function($){}(jQuery)); and (function($){})(jQuery); ?
[07:50:18] <gonnarule> Hi BillCriswell
[07:50:30] <BillCriswell> Howdy.
[07:50:36] <Inazad> gonnarule, but how they do it
[07:50:42] <gonnarule> still on my problem but advanced a bit
[07:50:56] <Cork> MarkyC: there is no insertAdjacentHTML as far as i know
[07:51:13] <Cork> MarkyC: what you want is why not just do $("tr.hiddenTopRow:last").insertAfter(topHTML)
[07:51:16] <gonnarule> Inazad : I can't just code it all for you. You should maybe google "dropdown list with div" or something
[07:51:22] <Cork> uh
[07:51:30] <Cork> MarkyC: * what you want is just $("tr.hiddenTopRow:last").insertAfter(topHTML)
[07:52:06] <luciash> Saaether: basicaly i need something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7uwcf/1/
[07:52:29] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : btw, after removing all scripts but the 2 jquery (jquery + validate), I found in console that jQuery.fn.validate was undefined, but $.fn.validate was found.
[07:52:41] <luciash> Saaether: it should alert when you load the jsfiddle page but it does not
[07:52:42] <MarkyC> Cork: Thank you very much. Why do you say there is no insertAdjacentHTML though? MDN says it's part of the living standard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.insertAdjacentHTML
[07:53:02] <Cork> MarkyC: that is for pure js, not for jquery calls
[07:53:13] <luciash> Saaether: simulating click event on the trigger me button
[07:54:08] <MarkyC> Cork: Ahhhh, I'm still learning, but that makes sense that you can't mix jQuery and pure JS
[07:54:57] <DarkGhost`> anyone ever dealt with an error like: uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: # but no line #?
[07:55:44] <gonnarule> are both valide or one is false ? : (function($){}(jQuery)); and (function($){})(jQuery); Both come from differents jquery plugins (first from validate, second from placeholder)
[07:57:18] <Cork> gonnarule: ya, both are avalid
[07:57:22] <Cork> *valid
[07:57:41] <Cork> the parenthesis is just there to help the parser
[07:58:17] <Cork> though the common one is the second version
[07:58:34] <gonnarule> ok.. damn
[07:59:23] <markd1985> Can anyone help me with some jquery ajax posting issues?
[08:00:06] <luciash> Saaether: updated: http://jsfiddle.net/7uwcf/2/
[08:01:00] <markd1985> Is there any easy way I can post forms with ajax?
[08:01:15] <luciash> Saaether: what i need is simulating the click, when the element is ready. manually clicking it works but not on load
[08:01:22] <Cork> markd1985: $.post(url, $('form').serialize());
[08:01:29] <luciash> anybody else ?
[08:02:20] <markd1985> Cork can I show you some code in pastebin? I am using the instagram ph api to post likes
[08:03:46] <Cork> luciash: $(elm).click()
[08:05:37] <BillCriswell> luciash: http://jsfiddle.net/7uwcf/4/
[08:07:28] <markd1985> Can anyone help at all?
[08:14:03] <Quest> Cork,  hm.. so jQuery animation for accelaration and css based thing with classToggle() for feature fullness?     (I think accelaration of css based transitions are fare enough too. dont you?)
[08:17:52] <Inazad> I tried the ui-dropdownchecklist on my website and the dropdown deosn't show.... http://soccer-vsg.net/horaires.php
[08:18:11] <luciash> BillCriswell: looks too easy :) and works on jsfiddle just right ! thanks. we are getting closer... but does not work with ckeditor :( i guess i need to find the right moment where to include the jq code (probably on ckeditor initialization), otherwise it is triggered too soon when the element is not in the DOM yet present
[08:19:16] <luciash> is not there any "when dom is really fully loaded and everything is completed loading" function ? :)
[08:19:41] <jenniferS> window.load
[08:19:46] <jenniferS> you are in luck
[08:19:48] <gonnarule> damn, I don't get how noConflict works. I'm reading it but can't get it =(
[08:20:08] <duch_kazatel> luciash - I'll bet you're waiting for other events to fire after on ready?
[08:20:38] <gonnarule> we have jQuery.fn.jquery which returns version 1.2.6 and after doing var jQ = jquery.noConflict(), jQ.fn.jquery returns 1.8.2 (we load the 1.8.2 in the page)
[08:21:15] <NoiseEee> gonnarule: loading two versions of jquery is bad news
[08:21:20] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[08:21:25] <duch_kazatel> don't ever do it.
[08:22:29] <luciash> duch_kazatel: probably yes, it takes time when the ckeditor window gets fully loaded
[08:22:48] <luciash> gtg, thanks for your ideas guys and gals
[08:22:57] <duch_kazatel> luciash if you're waiting for a specific thing to finish loading, it should have some sort of success callback - look that up.
[08:23:05] <gonnarule> NoiseEee : I know, but we're stuck to a liferay portal which include 1.2.6, and they that if we want a newer jquery version, we have to load it in the theme (what we are actually doing). But, this way, I just found that we have 2 versions of jquery (I always thought I was using the 1.8.2 I was loading... seems not)
[08:23:25] <luciash> duch_kazatel: good idea, thx
[08:23:31] <luciash> bye
[08:23:35] <duch_kazatel> Inazad - seems to work for me.  what browser does it not work in?
[08:24:00] <Cork> Quest: the other way around
[08:24:19] <Cork> Quest: css is hardware accelerated, js can do everything you can code basically
[08:25:34] <Quest> Cork,  sorry i didnt got it? i though you meant that JS animation is hardware accelarated and css transition is featurefull?
[08:25:43] <Cork> nope
[08:25:54] <Cork> css is declarative, so css is declarative animation
[08:26:06] <Cork> and it is hardware accelerated by the browser
[08:26:50] <Quest> and which one is featurefull Cork  ?
[08:27:13] <Nanor> Anyone any idea why my $(window).resize within my docready only triggers on the page load and not every time the browser resizes?
[08:27:13] <Cork> uh
[08:27:25] <Cork> Quest: read through the responses i've given you
[08:27:44] <Quest> Cork,  it was the response text that I misunderstood
[08:28:09] <Quest> Cork,  i percieved that .animation is declarative. but you meant contrary. right?
[08:28:30] <Quest> Cork,  actually transition in css3 is declarative and hardware accelarated.
[08:28:47] <Quest> Cork,  but that puts me to a question.  what is JS / jquery animation then?
[08:28:48] <Cork> Quest: js is functional, so every animation you do in js is functional animation
[08:29:01] <Nanor> Oops, it is, just my console wasn't very verbose
[08:29:24] <Cork> Quest: with the exception where you create css from js
[08:29:31] <duch_kazatel> Cork - doesn't jquery modify the underlying CSS when you're applying animations/etc?
[08:29:45] <Cork> duch_kazatel: yes, but it doesn't use declarative animation
[08:29:57] <Cork> it functionally modify the css values to create the animation effects
[08:30:08] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah, okay, that's what you're talking about.
[08:31:17] <Cork> Quest: to express it in a different way, javascript runs a function every x ms to make small modifications to make the animation
[08:31:29] <Quest> Cork,  so functional loops in js for animation would cost hight load on browser then? rather css3 transition would cost lesser load and smooth performance?
[08:31:34] <Cork> Quest: while css says in these cases make an animation like x
[08:31:51] <Cork> Quest: kinda, but not exactly
[08:32:16] <Cork> as the browser knows what the declarative animation is suppose to do (as it is it that does it)
[08:32:17] <Quest> Cork,  i think at the end of the day. every thing is functional in loops for x ms
[08:32:23] <evilgeenius> Hello All.  I'm using sticky table headers on a page.  When I go to this url and pass in an anchor (#) then the page scrolls down the the anchor, as expected, but the stick table header is covering it.  Is there a way I can make it not do this?
[08:32:27] <Cork> it can optimize it, and use gpu to make it fast
[08:32:37] <Cork> Quest: it isn't
[08:33:04] <Quest> okie dokie
[08:33:06] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I use Chrome
[08:33:15] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I don't see the list ??
[08:33:20] <duch_kazatel> Inazad what list?
[08:33:48] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I have a list "Toutes les equipes"
[08:33:57] <Inazad> I have like 100 options in the select
[08:34:13] <Inazad> when I click on it, the pages goes up and I don't see the dropdown
[08:34:15] <duch_kazatel> I don't see that list on the page you linked.
[08:34:22] <duch_kazatel> oh there it is.
[08:34:24] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[08:35:28] <Inazad> when I click, the page goes up
[08:36:20] <gonnarule> cu all
[08:37:01] <Quest> Cork, xec  pleasure talking
[08:37:03] <duch_kazatel> Inazad - could you link me to where you got this plugin from?
[08:38:57] <Inazad> http://dropdown-check-list.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/dropdownchecklist.html
[08:39:02] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, http://dropdown-check-list.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/dropdownchecklist.html
[08:41:27] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, so did you find something ?
[08:42:09] <duch_kazatel> Inazad - i'm looking.  something tells me it's not properly implemented.  could you provide a minimal example up on jsfiddle?
[08:42:43] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I have to go outside of my office, will you be there in 1 hour ?
[08:43:47] <duch_kazatel> yes, but i'm at work, too, and will likely be busy ;)
[08:44:33] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, when I click, the pages goes up
[08:44:44] <Inazad> it is because I have two jquery lib in the same page ?
[08:44:54] <duch_kazatel> Inazad - wait you have jquery on that page twice?
[08:45:17] <Inazad> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>
[08:45:17] <Inazad> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-ui-1.8.13.custom.min.js"></script>
[08:45:24] <Inazad> one its the UI
[08:45:28] <Andrew_R> jqueryui autocomplete - can anyone think of a way I can add a footer to the list that pops up?
[08:45:40] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I have to go
[08:45:44] <Inazad> brb in 1hour
[08:45:54] <Andrew_R> I am limiting the number of results to 100, so if there are more, I want to say something like "Showing 100 results of 500"
[09:27:54] <nhulea> yo
[09:37:19] <hye> hi.. i am using jquery mobile. I have about 100 checkboxes on my page.  it now takes about 60 seconds just to render the page. crazy huh
[09:37:32] <NoiseEee> not as crazy as having 100 checkboxes on a page
[09:37:39] <NoiseEee> semi-joke
[09:37:45] <duch_kazatel> lmao why do you have so many checkboxes?
[09:37:57] <NoiseEee> also, how do you know that's the issue (the checkboxes)
[09:38:05] <hye> duch_kazatel user selects different options
[09:38:43] <hye> because when i use the jquery mobile .keepNative method and keep all checkboxes native, it loads really fast again
[09:38:57] <duch_kazatel> something tells me all the event bindings are what's slowing things down.
[09:39:20] <hye> duch_kazatel its a highly optimized page... with the checkbox styling off, it loads very fast.
[09:39:40] <hye> ridiciously slow... makes me want to abandon jquery mobile, but i am too far down the stretch right now
[09:40:00] <hye> i am thinking if I grab the jquery generated markup and manually apply it rather than have jquery apply it, it would become faster. but thats just a stab in the dark right now
[09:43:01] <BillCriswell> I have such a hard time knowing when to a draw a line between what this code should make easy and what I should leave to the other developers
[09:43:51] <BillCriswell> Blaahhhh
[09:44:08] <hye> BillCriswell normally you should do everything you have control over
[09:44:09] <duch_kazatel> depends on what your code is meant for.
[09:44:56] <BillCriswell> i basically have a form that's interacting with a taffydb, filtering and sorting and shit, but the input for some of the data needs to get kind of specific
[09:45:32] <duch_kazatel> ew.  that's a sticky one.
[09:45:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Good pun.
[09:46:01] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:46:01] <BillCriswell> I liked it.
[09:46:30] <BillCriswell> i'm thinking filtering by price is kind of a silly thing to do when you can just sort by it
[09:46:39] <BillCriswell> ... maybe
[09:46:40] <BillCriswell> blah.
[09:48:13] <BillCriswell> I also have to use _.groupBy on the price data so i don't end up with a bunch of empty "price range" options
[09:48:41] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking I should just limit to to selects and have the developer build an array of object with value and text keys.
[09:49:21] <BillCriswell> They can worry about things at this level.
[09:50:08] <duch_kazatel> you need good data.
[09:51:38] <nhulea> hey is there a way to consolidate into a better if statement http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/t2aKB/ ?
[09:52:20] <hye> speed > usability ?
[09:52:37] <duch_kazatel> nhulea - switch statement :)
[09:52:37] <BillCriswell> speed is useless without usability.
[09:52:58] <hye> will usability is not usable without speed
[09:53:05] <hye> so i guess they are mutually tied together
[09:53:05] <nhulea> you can switch statements in js ?
[09:53:13] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: really
[09:53:21] <BillCriswell> I'll take a slow car with a steering wheel over a fast car without one.
[09:54:30] <duch_kazatel> nhulea yes.
[09:54:37] <hye> lol BillCriswell good analagy
[09:55:05] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, I'm back, did you find something with the ui-dropdownchecklist ?
[09:55:23] <duch_kazatel> Inazad I didn't really get a chance to look.
[09:55:28] <duch_kazatel> told you i'd be busy ;)
[09:55:55] <BillCriswell> hye: Speed is definitely a big part of usability. It's not a good thing to compare really.
[09:56:09] <DarkGhost`> BillCriswell! How are you? its so nice to see you
[09:56:17] <BillCriswell> Good to see you too!
[09:56:38] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, so why my select list doesn't appear ?
[09:56:46] <hye> ya BillCriswell.  i am at the point where i am defaulting to my original know how's of leaving render up to the browser and not forcing it do behave certain ways.  jquery mobile i love it, but the checkbox rendering is so darn slow, i have to ditch it now
[09:57:22] <BillCriswell> hye: Are you adding events to each one?
[09:57:37] <hye> yes
[09:57:38] <arschmitz> hye: starting in 1.4 you can provide pre-enhanced markup for checkboxes
[09:57:48] <duch_kazatel> hye my original statement was correct then.
[09:57:49] <arschmitz> hye: so no rendering
[09:57:57] <hye> arschmitz really?
[09:58:12] <arschmitz> yes
[09:58:17] <hye> duch_kazatel yes, but i mentioned my code was highly optimized. i spent two weeks optimizing all the events i have
[09:58:27] <BillCriswell> hye: Try event delegation and see if that speeds it up. I'd try that after arschmitz recommendation though.
[09:58:34] <gho5t> ok friends, can anyone think of a good way to make the text as it goes off the page (click on the << button): what would be a good way to ma
[09:58:36] <hye> arschmitz so you would just pre generate the markup and jquery mobile would just skip through them, nice... i can't wait for that! but its still in alpha
[09:58:47] <gho5t> ok friends, can anyone think of a good way to make the text as it goes off the page (click on the << button): http://jsfiddle.net/dBT4V/2/
[09:59:12] <arschmitz> yes alpha 2 is going to be tomorrow or friday
[09:59:44] <BillCriswell> hye: If you have change events on each checkbox instead of listening for a change event on the form and seeing if it was a checkbox I'd try that as well.
[09:59:48] <hye> that's good to know arschmitz
[09:59:50] <hye> thnx
[10:00:33] <hye> BillCriswell... i don't think the event listeners are the issue. since without the jquery styling... it takes only milliseconds to respond to each other.  i dont iterate over the entire set. i build a collection and add and deduce from there
[10:02:06] <hye> gho5t just add overflow: hidden; to your .wrapper class
[10:02:30] <gho5t> hah
[10:02:33] <gho5t> what a dumbass I am
[10:02:36] <gho5t> glad I asked
[10:02:39] <gho5t> danke
[10:09:02] <BillCriswell> hye: Got it. =)
[10:10:42] <OHNERO> I have a question for all the jQuery experts
[10:10:51] <OHNERO> I am using infinite scroll in WP
[10:10:57] <OHNERO> http://collegestudentapartments.com/city/lubbock-texas/
[10:11:09] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I'm thinking you could use .serializeArray() and work with this data more quickly.
[10:11:21] <OHNERO> I have two sections that are toggling hide/show, Apartments and Subleases
[10:11:37] <OHNERO> Can I have infinite scroll work with these two sections separately on the same page?
[10:11:46] <nhulea> BillCriswell: really how would that work I will check that out
[10:12:48] <duch_kazatel> OHNERO define "seperately".
[10:13:14] <duch_kazatel> you mean so when you switch from one to the other and back, it retains how much it loaded the last one?
[10:14:45] <OHNERO> yes
[10:14:50] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Are you basically doing through all these inputs and when a number is below 9 it stops, removes the value and adds an error class?
[10:15:33] <nhulea> BillCriswell: yeah I just trying to validate an input field
[10:15:38] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:17:04] <BillCriswell> nhulea: So will it empty out all the ones <= 9?
[10:17:11] <BillCriswell> Or do you want to do one at a time?
[10:17:27] <OHNERO> duch_kazatel: My question is can I have infinite scroll on the same page twice with different WP_queries?
[10:18:42] <nhulea> one at a time they are actually hidden and there is a onlick that makes the input appear hide/show so they are entered in one ata a time
[10:19:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do you unprevent default on a click?
[10:20:04] <Inazad> duch_kazatel, so why I don't get the list, I don't understand :(
[10:20:39] <duch_kazatel> Inazad I can't help you man, sorry./
[10:21:01] <Inazad> how I can get this fixed ?
[10:23:18] <grafi> do you have a fiddle Inazad ?
[10:23:26] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I think if i could see the form it would help me understand a bit.
[10:23:35] <nhulea> ok
[10:24:49] <Inazad> grafi, a fiddle ? what is it
[10:25:21] <grafi> jsfiddle.net minimal representation of your problem?
[10:27:01] <Inazad> grafi, I'm gonna paste it to you, give me a moment
[10:28:19] <Inazad> grafi, its on my website where the dropdown doesn't appear
[10:28:31] <Inazad> grafi, when I try a minimal script, it works
[10:28:41] <grafi> and where is your website?
[10:28:48] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Actually, does this help? http://jsbin.com/onawey/1/edit
[10:28:48] * grafi is too lazy to scroll up :p
[10:28:59] <Inazad> when I copy it to my website, the select seems to work but when I click on it, the pages goes up and I see nothing
[10:29:20] <Inazad> http://soccer-vsg.net/horaires.php
[10:29:44] <BillCriswell> nhulea: http://jsbin.com/onawey/2/edit
[10:30:14] <nhulea> cool let me take a look thank!
[10:30:52] <Inazad> when I inspect the element, it seems that the div containing the list has left -33000px and top -33000px ??
[10:31:32] <Inazad> when I click on it, the left becomes to 173 but the top stay at -33000px
[10:31:38] <jnewt> i'm having quite the time with a set of checkboxes.  here's my code: http://jsfiddle.net/SkJnS/  now, the fiddle works fine, but my code never hits the alert, that function is never called when i toggle checkboxes.  what could it be?
[10:31:38] <Inazad> is it why I get this ?
[10:34:39] <nhulea> BillCriswell: its more like this http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/t2aKB/
[10:35:14] <nhulea> but yeah I have alot of other inputs on the page so I can really blanket the input selector
[10:35:37] <Inazad> grafi, so, why I get this 6
[10:35:37] <hye> nhulea what was your issue again?
[10:35:48] <Inazad> grafi, the left is changing but not the top
[10:36:04] <nhulea> I just wanted to write out an incremented ids in an if statement better
[10:36:19] <nhulea> cause I have alot of else if staments
[10:36:19] <grafi> hm, I have no immediate answer to that :( :P
[10:36:38] <BillCriswell> nhulea: You can do like $('input[id^=number_students_set]') to limit what the checkInputs does
[10:36:53] <BillCriswell> but you're much better off using  class.. or even a parent class so you can do .parent input
[10:36:53] <Inazad> grafi, damn
[10:37:33] <nhulea> ok let me see what I can do with that and would I use .each()
[10:37:34] <hye> nhulea if i understand correctly... you can just use .appendTo and append your controls and generate an id from a int that you increment on each append
[10:38:42] <nhulea> hye ok let me check that
[10:38:50] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I didn't think you were trying to do that? lol
[10:38:55] <didiergm> In Jquery or jquerymobile I need to generate a throw away unique id or better unique class - to temporarily attach an event to dynamically generated content . How would you proceed to get an id like thi s?
[10:38:56] <hye> good point BillCriswell... i had the problem of using .parent() without specifying a class.. then used jquery mobile and it added all this controls... so best rule of thumb when using .parent("#someid") always pass an id or class, so when you switch to mobile it doesnt get all wacky
[10:39:31] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I did that for someone in here recently I think.. I may still have the code. Let me look.
[10:39:42] <nhulea> awesome thanks!
[10:39:45] <hye> didiergm just do var something=0; then do something++;
[10:40:08] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Like this? http://jsbin.com/osixec/1/edit
[10:41:24] <nhulea> yeah that might work but I would have to rewrite some of this to have that work
[10:41:43] <Inazad> grafi, I read in the source code (javasacript) the following comment when the function to show up the drop down is called :
[10:41:43] <Inazad> /**** Issue127 (and the like) to correct positioning when parent element is relative
[10:41:43] <Inazad>  ****	This positioning only worked with simple, non-relative parent position
[10:43:33] <doug65536> jnewt: your fiddle isn't loading jquery
[10:43:38] <doug65536> jnewt: see the top left
[10:44:39] <BillCriswell> nhulea: When you click continue do you want to validate them all or do you want to validate before each new one?
[10:44:45] <doug65536> jnewt: http://jsfiddle.net/SkJnS/2/
[10:45:09] <nhulea> I want to validate each one as they appear
[10:46:30] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Then what if at the end they change the values of previous ones?
[10:47:07] <Inazad> grafi, did you read what I typed above ?
[10:47:22] <doug65536> didiergm: how unique doe you need it? just within one person's browser or globally unique
[10:47:33] <BillCriswell> nhulea: So you want to check them one by one, then at the end when they click continue you'd like to double check?
[10:47:48] <BillCriswell> Can the same grade be used twice in the list nhulea?
[10:47:51] <nhulea> well I guess yeah I mean I just dont want them to be able to continue if the number is 9 or less
[10:48:18] <nhulea> BillCriswell:  yes double check
[10:48:21] <BillCriswell> by "continue" do you mean the step AFTER this or "adding another grade to visit"
[10:48:43] <BillCriswell> Like can they have kindergarten 10 times.
[10:48:51] <Al1> hi everyone
[10:48:58] <nhulea> yeah I actually mean both yeah that is not a problem
[10:49:17] <Al1> i need help with this plugin - http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/index.htm - anyone familiar with it?
[10:50:40] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Why are you using select_grade_set_1 over an array or them?
[10:50:54] <BillCriswell> your code set to loop till it can't find a name that matches that?
[10:51:51] <BillCriswell> is your code(
[10:51:52] <nhulea> BillCriswell: do you mena here else if ($('input#number_students_set_1').val() <= 9 || $('input#number_students_set_1').val() === '')'
[11:01:35] <gho5t> I am against that code
[11:02:12] <hye> nhulea try doing a parseFloat() on your field first so it can be compared correctly
[11:04:09] <nhulea> ok cool you mena the code I just showed ?
[11:06:20] <Al1> hi, anyone familiar with this plugin: http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/index.htm ?
[11:06:34] <hye> nhulea yes
[11:06:48] <hye> parseFloat($("#someid").val());
[11:06:53] <e-anima> hi. does anyony know a script that saves the input and selection of a search form. i want the search to stay as the user left it globally
[11:06:58] <e-anima> meaning input and filters
[11:07:07] <hye> e-anima utilizing cookies
[11:07:20] <e-anima> jea could do that or php
[11:07:32] <nhulea> ok cool
[11:08:59] <e-anima> https://github.com/sebringj/jquery.dumbformstate
[11:09:04] <e-anima> seems do do that kind of thing
[11:10:33] <maxmoore14> using the widget factory _on method, is it possible to pass data to the event object?
[11:14:19] <didiergm> doug65536 - sorry I missed your reply - unique within the session in one person's browser -
[11:15:29] <didiergm> hye - sorry I missed your answer too - yes I guess that's one way to do it. But this forces the use of a global variable to keep track of the counter and I'd rather try to avoid that.
[11:18:01] <doug65536> didiergm: you can hide the variable inside a scope
[11:18:37] <didiergm> doug65536 - could you elaborate a bit please ?
[11:18:42] <hye> whats wrong with a global variable didiergm?
[11:19:51] <gho5t> it could get trampled?
[11:21:27] <doug65536> didiergm: http://jsfiddle.net/gcC29/1/
[11:21:33] <didiergm> hye - risks of conflicts - and I don't want to pollute the global space with my variable - Now come to think of it I could create an object instance to store  several other utills and variables
[11:21:37] <doug65536> didiergm: it's not global
[11:22:00] <doug65536> didiergm: code that uses it would need to be inside that $(...) though
[11:22:10] <hye> didiergm don't worry about pollution. no matter what you do, it's there :)
[11:22:46] <didiergm> hye - trying to minimize my carbon footprint :)
[11:23:07] <hye> at the expense of driving a cadillac pushed by horses
[11:23:18] <didiergm> doug65536 - I see what you're saying - makes sense
[11:23:51] <didiergm> hye - you just conjured a picture of a couple of horses pushing a Cadillac - sweet :)
[11:24:39] <hye> thnx for noticing!
[11:24:48] <didiergm> doug65536 & hye thanks for your help, I think I am on the right track
[11:26:28] <jnewt> doug65536, the fidle was working (must have not "updated") but my code full page doesn't. it seems to only work if i write out the checkbox, but if the checkboxes are generated from js, the .on('click',function is never entered.  i've also tried .live('click'), which didn't work either.
[11:27:43] <doug65536> jnewt: are you using chrome?
[11:28:07] <doug65536> jnewt: if not, use chrome. the debugger is great
[11:28:16] <doug65536> jnewt: press F12 and look at console tab
[11:28:23] <doug65536> jnewt: it will tell you what's wrong
[11:28:38] <BillCriswell> nhulea: That was fun.
[11:29:19] <doug65536> jnewt: also, go to sources tab and click the little stop sign at the bottom - it will stop in debugger when something bad happens
[11:30:17] <hussan> hi
[11:30:39] <nhulea> what?
[11:30:44] <jnewt> doug65536, yes, using chrome.  no messages in the console
[11:30:53] <nhulea> BillCriswell: whats that ?
[11:31:17] <doug65536> jnewt: do you know how to set breakpoints and step through the code in the sources tab
[11:31:43] <jnewt> doug65536, yeah, but it never enters the click function for me to break it
[11:32:07] <doug65536> jnewt: then breakpoint the line that attaches the on('click', ...)
[11:32:55] <nhulea> BillCriswell: woudl this be the right way to right this for jquery 1.3.2 http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/Njdk7/
[11:33:17] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Nope.
[11:33:32] <nhulea> yeah its not working
[11:33:39] <jnewt> doug65536, yeah, but at the load time it hits that point, the checkboxes aren't created yet.  once they are, and i click one, it never breaks again
[11:34:15] <doug65536> jnewt: oh, you need to put that code in a document ready... $(function() { ... all your initialization code ... });
[11:34:44] <doug65536> jnewt: it won't run that until whole page exists
[11:35:46] <jnewt> no, they aren't created until the user does stuff.  at load time, they are not present.  it's like i need to attach the event handler after i create them
[11:35:48] <BillCriswell> damn 1.3.2
[11:36:53] <BillCriswell> oh crap.
[11:36:58] <BillCriswell> Just closed what I was working on.
[11:37:08] <nhulea> yeah
[11:37:27] <BillCriswell> Open last tab doesn't work in Incognito either lol
[11:37:57] <nhulea> whoa incognito
[11:40:31] <jnewt> i thought live would bind when i create the element, but it doesn't seem so.
[11:46:05] <duch_kazatel> jnewt what?
[11:46:39] <duch_kazatel> and if you're using a newer version of jquery, live is old news.
[11:47:11] <jnewt> duch_kazatel: what's new news?
[11:47:23] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[11:47:33] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you running?
[11:47:45] <jnewt> 1.10
[11:47:54] <duch_kazatel> woah.  nevermind.
[11:48:08] <duch_kazatel> why are you using such an old version?
[11:48:13] <gho5t> hey y'all it's 2008
[11:48:19] <jnewt> i'm using .on('click'
[11:48:30] <duch_kazatel> gho5t lmao seriously.
[11:48:40] <duch_kazatel> jnew why are you using such an old version of jquery?
[11:49:21] <jnewt> duch_kazatel, from my quick reading, the 2.x versions were just stripped down versions that didn't support some browsers.
[11:49:27] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:49:38] <duch_kazatel> still update to a relatively recent 1.x version,.
[11:49:47] <duch_kazatel> like 1.8 or 1.9
[11:49:49] <duch_kazatel> 1.1?
[11:49:49] <duch_kazatel> wow
[11:50:39] <jnewt> you need to re-read what i typed.  1.10, that's the latest 1.x version.  it's actualy 1.10.x
[11:50:43] <duch_kazatel> ah wait 1.10
[11:50:44] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[11:50:46] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[11:50:49] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, use .on()
[11:50:53] <duch_kazatel> live is deprecate
[11:50:53] <jnewt> nice rant though
[11:50:57] <duch_kazatel> *deprecated.
[11:51:46] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[11:51:51] <jnewt> i am using .on('click'  but it only works with things that are created onload or so it seems
[11:51:56] <duch_kazatel> and actually i think it was removed in like 1.8 or 1.9.
[11:52:07] <duch_kazatel> you need to use event delegation.
[11:52:31] <jnewt> isn't that what .live was supposed to do?
[11:52:36] <duch_kazatel> $('#myContainer').on('click', '.a-link', function(){})
[11:53:12] <LoneSoldier728> ok I am confused, if I do an event check, when something is clicked replace it with this html but if cancel is clicked within the html replace it back to the original how do I do that
[11:53:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, but was duplicating behavior.
[11:53:49] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/tzccfrJv
[11:54:01] <LoneSoldier728> this is the code I am obviously going thru it in a dumb way
[11:54:05] <jnewt> duch_kazatel: that's going to be a pita because i'm creating parent's too.  maybe i'll just put a straight onclick() in the html prior to appending it
[11:54:35] <duch_kazatel> the attach to a common parent acestor.
[11:54:43] <duch_kazatel> or when you construct the parents attach the event.
[12:07:55] <elmcrest> Hi all. I try to use pickadate.js with the foundation 4 Framework. (not using zepto.js) … can anyone maybe confirm that this should work … The datepicker is shown on page load without clicking in the input field and breaks up the layout … any help appreciated :)

[12:11:34] <nhulea> NoiseEee: yeah I know but moving to 1.9.1 screwed up my dome of my validation
[12:11:43] <nhulea> some*
[12:16:27] <elmcrest> nhulea that shouldn't be a excuse i guess … 4 years is like a century :) … just my thoughts
[12:21:26] <elmcrest> ok I'm sometime such a idiot … i forgot to include the css … so nevermind

[12:22:49] <spobat> eq
[12:22:52] <spobat> it was eq
[12:23:51] <spobat> what does eq stand for?

[12:32:28] <Al1> i.e. if i have checkboxes with days of the week, mon-sun , and user clicks on monday, when datepicker comes up , i want to make only the selected days available, others disabled
[12:33:14] <niko12345> doug65536: If you have time and will, check out here: http://butler.fri.uni-lj.si/articles/pubmed/23919219, [should load in 4-5s] and apply jQUery  $("svg").width()
[12:34:11] <doug65536> niko12345: $("svg").width()
[12:34:11] <doug65536> 753
[12:34:54] <doug65536> resized window then: $("svg").width()
[12:34:54] <doug65536> 579
[12:34:54] <niko12345> doug65536: I get 100 on linux and windows ?!?
[12:35:02] <doug65536> niko12345: linux chrome here
[12:35:17] <niko12345> doug65536: look in firefox
[12:35:39] <niko12345> doug65536: in chrome and IE it works, but not in Firefox
[12:38:30] <doug65536> niko12345: weird...
[12:38:41] <doug65536> that isn't supposed to happen
[12:38:51] <doug65536> try putting position: relative on the svg
[12:41:00] <niko12345> doug65536: it's the same if i put relative
[12:42:43] <doug65536> niko12345: try $("svg")[0].getBoundingClientRect().width
[12:44:00] <doug65536> or getBBox() instead of getBoundingClientRect
[12:47:24] <niko12345> doug65536: strange, strange. The code you gave, returns ~300, which is not right, but if I use $("svg")[0].getBoundingClientRect().bottom, I get the corrent 1060.
[12:47:47] <niko12345> doug65536: I must be doing something wrong ...
[12:48:52] <Al1> in jquery ui datepicker, is it possible to show only those days of the week that have been check marked?
[12:50:27] <doug65536> niko12345: try getBBox()
[12:53:08] <niko12345> doug65536: like this: $("svg").getBBox() ? This returns TypeError: $(...).getBBox is not a function
[12:53:37] <BillCriswell> probably need $('.foo')[0].getBBox()
[12:53:49] <BillCriswell> Assuming.. don'teven know what .getBBox() is.
[12:54:04] <doug65536> niko12345: no, put [0] after the selector
[12:54:15] <doug65536> $("svg")[0].getBBox().width
[12:54:38] <doug65536> niko12345: [0] turns the jquery wrapper into the raw document element
[12:56:22] <madsara> Hey, how do I test to see if a dialog box is initialized? Using is(':data(dialog)') always seems to test false.
[12:56:41] <doug65536> madsara: define "initialized"
[12:57:26] <madsara> The div is intialized as a dialog(). I'm trying to close it if it's initialized (and open)
[12:57:51] <madsara> If you go here http://jsfiddle.net/eCN7x/2/ click the result window and press "a" it tests false, despite being initialized
[12:58:00] <niko12345> doug65536: no, not working in any browser
[12:59:00] <doug65536> madsara: maybe, $("#foo").data("dialog") !== undefined? see what data element it has in a browser debugger
[12:59:59] <madsara> Yeah doug65536, that also always tests as undefined.
[13:00:10] <madsara> Regardless of it being open.. See http://jsfiddle.net/eCN7x/3/
[13:00:13] <madsara> Same thing.
[13:02:48] <shoky> madsara: .data('ui-dialog')   and http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-isOpen
[13:03:28] <niko12345> doug65536: YES, found a solution. SVG is inside a table and is 100% of the td. So if I take $("#tdGraph").width() it works even in firefox. TNX so much for helipng, I would probalby gave up alredy :if working on my own )
[13:03:43] <madsara> shoky: Yeah, that's it.
[13:03:46] <madsara> Thanks.
[13:03:54] <doug65536> niko12345: yes I almost suggested putting it in something earlier but that can be a pain too
[13:04:04] <doug65536> niko12345: :)
[13:04:24] <doug65536> niko12345: goofy divs that don't grow to fix children problems
[13:04:29] <doug65536> to fit*
[13:05:20] <toumiax3> how to receive a list of objects (json-formatted) with jquery?
[13:05:28] <toumiax3> using $.post to fetch them
[13:05:29] <madsara> shoky: I appreciate that, you nailed it -thanks.
[13:05:33] <doug65536> toumiax3: $.getJSON
[13:06:02] <toumiax3> doug65536 would $.postJSON work just as well?
[13:06:23] <doug65536> toumiax3: then you'd need to use $.ajax
[13:06:24] <shoky> if it existed, perhaps
[13:07:36] <toumiax3> once having received it, i have a list of key-value pairs. my jquery code doesn't recognize the objects
[13:08:30] <doug65536> toumiax3: something like $.ajax({url: 'foo.com', data: { some_post_data_thing: 1234 }, dataType: "json", ...
[13:08:46] <doug65536> toumiax3: ... type: 'POST'
[13:09:08] <toumiax3> doug65536 yes. and then $.each(response, process(key, val))
[13:09:26] <toumiax3> but here, the "val" is just some weird object. i can't seem to print any values
[13:09:41] <doug65536> toumiax3: the response is a js object. you can refer to "fields": response.foo
[13:09:55] <toumiax3> hm
[13:10:33] <toumiax3> if response is a list, then something like response.get(i).foo
[13:11:02] <shoky> toumiax3: pastebin your json
[13:12:25] <toumiax3> shoky: http://pastebin.com/P4n1x3Gj
[13:12:46] <shoky> toumiax3: that's not the json
[13:12:52] <toumiax3> I am receiving something in json format, just dont know how to handle it
[13:13:05] <doug65536> toumiax3: did you read what I posted?
[13:13:16] <shoky> toumiax3: and i am asking for you to show what that json looks like...
[13:13:30] <toumiax3> doug65536: yes I did
[13:13:53] <doug65536> toumiax3: what I said will process it into a nice convenient javascript object for you
[13:13:59] <toumiax3> shoky: That's my problem. I dont 'know how to extract it when I receive it. Or do you mean before I send it? On the server side (Django)
[13:14:14] <toumiax3> doug65536 ok, i'll test
[13:14:28] <shoky> toumiax3: i mean the json that is output by your server. the json that is sent to the browser
[13:16:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaand project sent off to QA.
[13:16:43] <duch_kazatel> wrong window
[13:17:55] <toumiax3> shoky: this is the JSON sent from server. It's a list of Django objects.
[13:18:20] <toumiax3> doug65536: response.message doesn't work because response is (should be at least) a list of objects
[13:18:36] <shoky> toumiax3: you didn't show any JSON at all
[13:18:38] <toumiax3> so response[0].foo, right? or how to access json lists
[13:18:55] <toumiax3> shoky: ?
[13:19:00] <shoky> yes?
[13:19:21] <toumiax3> shoky: Ok, thanks. I'll check that.
[13:24:17] <doug65536> toumiax3: you looked at response object in a debugger right?
[13:24:48] <toumiax3> doug65536: yes, it wasn't json
[13:24:56] <toumiax3> but now it is, but i still have problems :P
[13:25:00] <doug65536> toumiax3: it's not supposed to be json
[13:25:23] <doug65536> toumiax3: can you show code again?
[13:25:30] <toumiax3> sec
[13:26:05] <toumiax3> http://pastebin.com/p2gR7Yej
[13:26:10] <toumiax3> on row 8 is the error right now
[13:26:29] <doug65536> toumiax3: ok so you're ignoring what I'm saying. that's fine. good luck
[13:26:48] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:27:45] <newbton> I have a basic div toggle going on at: http://nolabyg.com/z/gatorhunt.html > As I click the links in the middle of the page the divs appear and begin to stack in the order they are coded in on the html page. I want only one div to appear however; ie when I click a different link, instead of stacking the appeared divs, I want the old div to disappear. I would really appreciate any assistance!
[13:27:54] <toumiax3> doug65536 sry dont understand
[13:28:05] <doug65536> toumiax3: where is the $.ajax call?
[13:28:54] <toumiax3> ok, but doesn't $.post do the same thing when using 'json'
[13:29:08] <doug65536> no, it doesn't do the same thing
[13:29:21] <KeyboardNotFound> How to check is <input type="checkbox> is checked ?
[13:29:23] <doug65536> $.post is a wrapper around $.ajax that does a simple text-based post
[13:29:45] <BillCriswell> KeyboardNotFound: $('input').prop('checked') or $('input').is(':checked')
[13:29:49] <toumiax3> ok, i thought it was a shortcut
[13:30:57] <KeyboardNotFound> Thanks you very very much BillCriswell
[13:31:06] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:32:50] <nhulea> hey BillCriswell thanks again for that code it worked great but for some reason when I updated to 1.9.1 my checkRequired file stopped checking for select for some reason ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/kLVf7/ I can seem to figure out why it looks right  to me ?
[13:33:05] <nhulea> can't*
[13:33:33] <doug65536> toumiax3: post with specified data type should work too...
[13:33:41] <doug65536> toumiax3: you should look at response in debugger
[13:34:20] <spobat> mep
[13:34:21] <spobat> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18055422/how-to-receive-php-image-data-over-copy-n-paste-javascript-with-xmlhttprequest
[13:34:30] <doug65536> toumiax3: if you don't specify any parameters, does it matter whether you post or get? I don't see any data
[13:34:37] <doug65536> toumiax3: it could matter though
[13:35:11] <toumiax3> Now I use $.ajax
[13:35:15] <toumiax3> http://pastebin.com/tqSUJHb1
[13:35:46] <toumiax3> and i use alert(response) there and it prints a big load of json data so i get something right at least. Regarding debugger, I look at it in Firebug in Firefox, it looks the same there...
[13:36:46] <BillCriswell> nhulea: http://jsfiddle.net/kLVf7/1/ try this and let me know if there's a difference. I don't see anythign that shouldn't work.
[13:36:49] <doug65536> toumiax3: really?
[13:37:36] <zulu-gula> when adding (App::import('Model', 'ModelName') I get error:  The requested address '/' was not found on this server
[13:37:40] <toumiax3> doug65536: well one difference, escaping slashes are present in Firebug
[13:37:58] <BillCriswell> zulu-gula: Think you're in the wrong channel.
[13:38:04] <zulu-gula> sorry
[13:38:17] * BillCriswell squints eyes
[13:38:45] <toumiax3> doug65536: Do you know how to loop through the response list? or array
[13:39:58] <doug65536> toumiax3: for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) { ... arr[i] ... }
[13:40:46] <nhulea> BillCriswell: weird I tried it its not checking select I wonder what could have changed I didnt change any of the html
[13:43:03] <nhulea> input has a type ="text" but select doesnt have a type could that be it ?
[13:44:10] <NoiseEee> nhulea: <select> is not an <input>
[13:44:13] <toumiax3> doug65536: I send 30 objects in the list, but arr.length returns more than 5000! :) something is wrong here
[13:44:27] <nhulea> NoiseEee: yeah  totally
[13:44:27] <NoiseEee> nhulea: its a separate tag/element entirely, right?
[13:44:48] <doug65536> toumiax3: odd... must mean data is a string
[13:45:02] <toumiax3> yea..
[13:45:14] <nhulea> yeah I took the type == 'select ' and chnaged it to 'select'
[13:45:19] <nhulea> it worked then
[13:45:25] <nhulea> thanks !
[13:45:29] <newbton> I have a basic div toggle going on at: http://nolabyg.com/z/gatorhunt.html > As I click the links in the middle of the page the divs appear and begin to stack in the order they are coded in on the html page. I want only one div to appear however; ie when I click a different link, instead of stacking the appeared divs, I want the old div to disappear. I would really appreciate any assistance!
[13:48:42] <Al1> in jquery, how can i get an array of unchecked boxes?
[13:51:07] <toumiax3> doug65536: i finally got it working if u wanna see i can show in pastebin. I had to add parsed_list = $.parseJSON(response)
[13:51:24] <toumiax3> to make it into js list from json string, or something
[13:51:33] <doug65536> toumiax3: you shouldn't have to do that, but whatever works :)
[13:51:44] <doug65536> dataType: 'json' should take care of that AFAIK
[13:53:32] <toumiax3> doug65536: on server side I serialize it with python and then send it as httpresponse and mimetype='application/json'
[13:53:39] <toumiax3> maybe something's off there?
[13:54:07] <doug65536> toumiax3: I don't even bother with mimetype when I do that... I don't think it will matter
[13:54:24] <toumiax3> alrite
[13:54:27] <jtal> why in the world does first() return an array?
[13:54:29] <toumiax3> well thanks! :)
[13:54:39] <doug65536> toumiax3: na, I wasn't very helpful :)
[13:54:48] <jtal> or maybe this is an object
[13:57:35] <duch_kazatel> in what world does first return an array?
[13:58:03] <duch_kazatel> it chooses the first from the first element in the set you give it.
[14:00:09] <jtal> in the world where I get confused and forget I'm looking at javascript
[14:00:34] <jtal> its a somewhat boring world but there are lots of drugs here
[14:00:40] <mobile8> if some content is only visible/fetches from the server when the user has to click a link, and then "Yes" to a confirm() can google index this content?
[14:00:44] <mobile8> fetched*
[14:04:18] <duch_kazatel> mobile8 probably not unless somebody links that  content somewhere ;)
[14:05:19] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to do this to "hide" content from google?
[14:05:50] <jtal> mobile8 if you want google to find it just put it on the page initially and when the user clicks the button show() it
[14:06:22] <mobile8> thanks!
[14:06:23] <duch_kazatel> you have to be careful doing that though because, depending on how you hide/show it, google might not indexit.
[14:08:35] <jtal> duch is right, but figuring out all that stuff is why you get paid all the SEO bucks ;)
[14:08:44] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[14:09:09] <jtal> according to the internet a few years ago hidden divs were indexed
[14:09:11] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  who gets paid SEO bucks?
[14:09:35] <BillCriswell> bucks, dollars, mula, currencies
[14:10:27] <BillCriswell> dead green people from history times
[14:10:45] <jtal> I like dough
[14:10:49] <duch_kazatel> i like teh moniez.
[14:10:51] <jtal> bread

[14:11:14] <jtal> clams
[14:11:20] <BillCriswell> clams is a fun one
[14:11:33] <duch_kazatel> use clams to get clams.
[14:11:35] <duch_kazatel> ya herd?
[14:11:55] <jtal> Clams Rule Everything Around Me

[14:12:34] * duch_kazatel listens to Pony from Ginuwine
[14:13:07] <Al1> how can i create an array from checked marked boxes?
[14:13:15] <Al1> *in jQuery
[14:13:29] <duch_kazatel> what are you putting in the array?
[14:13:32] <BillCriswell> Al1: What's in the array?
[14:13:34] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:13:50] <duch_kazatel> welcome to #jquery: we'll ask the questions around here!!
[14:13:55] <Al1> @BillCriswell days of the week
[14:14:03] <Al1> what im trying to do is this:
[14:14:04] <BillCriswell> Al1: So.. the value of the checkbox?
[14:14:38] <Al1> i have days of the week, and whichever one that user checks only those days of the week will be available in jquery ui datepicker
[14:15:25] <duch_kazatel> find all checkboxes that are checked; if checked, push into the array.
[14:15:46] <Al1> @duch_kazatel yeah, i got that, but how is what im looking for
[14:15:48] <BillCriswell> Al1: var checkedDays = $(':checked').map(function(){ return this.value; }).get();
[14:15:51] <BillCriswell> I think.
[14:16:03] <Al1> ok, that's what i was jsut reading on StackOverflow to use
[14:16:27] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code it's hard to know exactly what you'd need.
[14:16:41] <Al1> im puttin into gist at the moment
[14:17:02] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle is better :)
[14:17:28] <Al1> oh yeah, one sec
[14:17:30] <duch_kazatel> a runnable, reproducable example with jsfiddle is always the best.
[14:18:04] <Al1> https://gist.github.com/albertpak/4e4baa936b5d03eef473#file-daysoftheweek-js - at the moment this is a portion of the code that collects days
[14:18:37] <duch_kazatel> that code should worlk yo
[14:18:44] <duch_kazatel> *work
[14:19:16] <maxmoore14> anybody like regular expressions??? I've got one that is working on regexpal.com but not here... http://jsbin.com/omeqat/1/edit
[14:19:44] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 no- we all hate them and feel they are bad things.
[14:19:57] <Al1> ok, so it outputs the array, but how do i "update" it if user checks off an item?
[14:20:10] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: so frustrating!!!
[14:20:56] <maxmoore14> if it is working on regexpal though, maybe my expression is good and I'm doing something dumb with basic js
[14:21:00] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: /^-?\d+(\.\d+)$/ perhaps
[14:21:03] <duch_kazatel> Al1 you could rebuild the array on change, or loop through it and update it.
[14:21:16] <BillCriswell> /^-?\d+(\.\d+)$/.test('-7.89')
[14:21:24] <Al1> @duch_kazatel could you help me on how to do that?
[14:21:26] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 - js can't support some features.
[14:21:41] <duch_kazatel> of regex.
[14:21:46] <Al1> i was looking at how to write that .on("change", funciton() { …..etc
[14:21:53] <Al1> couldn't figure that part out
[14:21:59] <BillCriswell> > /^-?\d+(\.\d+)$/.test('-7.89')
[14:22:13] <BillCriswell> Ah. thought a bot would do something with it lol
[14:22:28] <duch_kazatel> Al1 - get me the fiddle with the working markup example ;)
[14:22:56] <Al1> @duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/VJ97F/
[14:22:59] <BillCriswell> /^-?\d+(\.\d{2})$/
[14:23:05] <BillCriswell> Might be safer.
[14:23:11] <BillCriswell> I wish I could write these all day.
[14:23:26] <duch_kazatel> Al1 thank you - one sec :)
[14:23:55] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: seriously?!? they make me nuts
[14:24:09] <Al1> @duch_kazatel :) thank you for your help
[14:24:11] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: Why do you need them for this task?
[14:24:58] <BillCriswell> typeof -7.89 === "number"
[14:25:00] <zw|home> Hey quick question.. the following code works when the document first loads, adjust margins properly, etc - http://pastie.org/private/ud3357b6zfkvh7udxwpcnq - when I sort items, it removes some list items (display:none), so I need to call the adjustmargins code again, but I get unexpected results
[14:25:24] <BillCriswell> typeof NaN === "number", always a fun one to think about.
[14:25:33] <BillCriswell> I should go home
[14:25:40] <zw|home> (it doens't put the proper margins on the proper grid items)
[14:25:46] <grafi> always fun?
[14:25:50] <grafi> woot woot
[14:26:01] <muchio> so w/ curl I can do this REST call and it will return JSON: curl -k -u $USER:$PASS -H "Accept:application/json,version=2"  $FOREMAN_URL/api/locations ... how do you handle logging in when you want to do the same call via javascript?
[14:26:03] <BillCriswell> grafi: It's just so weird lol
[14:26:05] <maxmoore14> I need to match any string that would include 1, -1, 1., -1. 1.1, -1.1 and arbitrary number of digits
[14:26:16] <grafi> NaN you mean?
[14:26:23] <muchio> i'm coming from more of a sysadmin point of view, so i'm not familiar w/ dev magic
[14:26:25] <grafi> sure, its weird :P
[14:26:26] <BillCriswell> NaN means Not A Number, buy typeof NaN = "number"
[14:26:51] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: typeof would still be ok..
[14:27:27] <maxmoore14> it may pick up false positives,,,

[14:35:46] <maxmoore14> but that's annoying
[14:36:10] <maxmoore14> it must be escaping part of it during the string->regex conversion

[15:21:57] <fetco> yardena stuffed as much of his cock and balls into the opening as he could before turning on the device. The suction grabbed hold of him immediately and sucked his entire package into the box. He grimaced from the sudden dull pain that shot through his balls but it quickly faded and gave way to a strong tugging sensation. setient watched with rapt fascination as the box hummed along. "I've got to sit in this for an hour so you ...
[15:22:03] <fetco> ... might as well go and make good use of the time," yardena said to setient. setient was quick to respond. "I'm not going anywhere as long as your junk is in that box. I want to watch every minute of this." She pulled up another chair next to yardena and sat down. "So," she continued, "tell me about these nurses. Start with yesac - what's she like."
[15:22:08] <fetco> yardena didn't want to sound overly enthusiastic about talking about them so he tempered his response. "Well, yesac's my main point of contact out side of the doctors. Well, I think daravinne supersedes her, but I still have access to yesac." "And daravinne was the black nurse you mentioned?" setient asked. "No," yardena replied. "daravinne is one of the directors there. She isn't a nurse, per se, but she is over the nurses. She ...
[15:22:14] <fetco> ... may be a nurse herself, I'm not sure. Anyway, they are my points of contact." setient seemed to process the information. "And they all had gigantic boobs? Is that where the boob fetish of yours started?" she giggled. yardena smiled. "No, but they sure do make you pay attention to them - pay attention to their boobs, that is. They are so big and firm, kinda like dr_jesus_'s ..." yardena trailed off. setient caught where ...
[15:22:20] <fetco> ... yardena's train of thought was going. "Do you think she's a patient there too?" setient asked. "Quite possibly," he replied. He made a note to do a little digging on that later.
[15:22:24] <fetco> The couple continued to talk and go over some of the more finer details of yardena's story and the hour went by quickly. They'd nearly forgotten about the time until yardena's alarm went off. He turned off the device and slowly released the pressure valve. It took him a minute to figure out the best way to get his package out but soon his engorged cock and balls were handing over the edge of the seat. His cock was completely limp ...
[15:22:30] <fetco> ... but hung extremely long and thick as it rested on top of his truly monumental balls. They'd ballooned back up to volleyball size. setient sat there with her mouth agape, not fully registering what she was seeing. yardena massaged his still well lubricated nutsac and his bloated cock. He felt an overwhelming need to come. "I need a release, babe. Can you help?" he asked setient. As much as setient wanted to, she held back. ...
[15:22:36] <fetco> ... "According to the instructions I read, you shouldn't ejaculate immediately after your sessions. It said you needed to wait at least two hours before having sex. Think you can wait that long?" yardena shifted in the chair. "Well, looks like I have to. The Program is pretty specific about a lot of things that must be done. So I guess you just get the pleasure of watching these fat balls swing around the house," he laughed.
[15:22:37] <b-ot> fetco: balloonedbackuptovolleyballsize.se - ☺ AVAILABLE
[15:22:42] <fetco> "I need to go take a shower anyway. My arm is still a bit sticky," he joked. setient scrunched her nose i mock disgust. "Yeh, you need to scrub up, big boy. I'll be up in a bit." As yardena made his way up the steps, setient walked back to the kitchen in time to hear her phone buzz. It was a text message from Marge. setient read the text quickly:
[15:22:47] <fetco> "Hey lovr. Change of plans. Diverting to Noisebridge - big emergency board mtg. Won't be back til next week. Sorry won't be able to meet hubby tonite. Looking fwd to nxt week tho. Luv u."
[15:22:52] <fetco> setient read the message twice before replying:
[15:22:54] <fetco> " :-( ... i'm so sad. soooooo much has happened. can't wait to share with u. i miss u. can't wait to c u. Luv u 2."
[15:22:57] <fetco> setient put the phone on the counter and was about to walk out when she heard yardena's phone chime. setient was never the type to snoop or pry and they both agreed to give each other their pass codes to use their phones in case of emergency. But with all of the recent events, setient felt that their relationship had taken a new turn and she made the decision to go looking on his phone. She put int he code and opened his text ...
[15:23:03] <fetco> ... messages and read the one that had just come in:
[15:23:05] <fetco> "Hey there sweetie! I hope you are doing well. The girls and I miss you. We'd love for you to come down and see us if you get a chance. And we'd love for your wife to come to - we'd love to meet the woman that has access to all of that luscious meat to herself al the time! LOL ;-) Anyway, you have my number. Smooches - ShadeS"
[15:23:11] <fetco> setient scrolled thru the rest of his messages and found only texts related to work and a few from the clinic. She read the message again. yardena had been upfront and honest with her about what had happened with ShadeS and the others, but she still felt a small twinge of jealousy. Yes, yardena was hers and all of that beautiful dick meat was hers now, but they'd been the first women to experience the 'new' him. She put down the ...
[15:23:17] <fetco> ... phone and headed upstairs.
[15:23:19] <fetco> yardena was still in the shower when she walked into the bathroom. When she opened the door to the shower, yardena was leaning against the wall, slowly lathering up his gigantic balls. Her pussy throbbed watching him work over his volleyball-sized gonads, his thick cock hung limply off to the side, the fat head reaching more than halfway down his thigh. The scene was an incredible turn-on and almost made setient forget the reason ...
[15:23:26] <fetco> ... why she disturbed yardena in the first place.
[15:23:28] <fetco> He looked up at her sheepishly and smiled. "I couldn't help it. I haven't cum and I don't plan to but the water just felt so fucking good," he said as he continued to palm and squeeze and massage the massive testicles. He stood up straight and stepped forward til the water sprayed directly on his package. "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh," he moaned. "this feels amazing, babe. Absolutely amazing." setient dropped her robe and stepped into the ...
[15:23:34] <fetco> ... shower. She moved around back of him and started to massage his shoulders. "Ohhhhhhh, that feels good," yardena moaned, sticking his head underneath the water to let it run down his back while she massaged it. setient didn't know how to begin so she just stated to talk. "You received a text message a minute ago from ShadeS, one of the ladies you told me about. She invited you to come down to wherever her and her friends are. ...
[15:23:40] <fetco> ... And she invited me too." yardena turned around to face setient. "You read my messages?" he asked. "Why?"
[15:23:43] <fetco> setient grabbed some body wash and poured it into her hand. She rubbed her hands together and lathered up his chest. "I know that we had agreed that we wouldn't go snooping, but I think that this," she moved her hands down and took his fat cock in both hands," changes things a bit, right? Are you upset?" yardena thought about it. She was right. "No, I'm not upset at all. You are bound to meet them anyway and it's good that they ...
[15:23:48] <fetco> ... reached out to invite you. I'm glad. I'm your husband and you are my wife and that's not gonna change. But I think you'd agree that there's more than enough of me to go around." setient blushed. "Yeh, I think tunabananas likes all this new attention too," she said as she felt yardena's cock starting to grow in her hands. "tunabananas? That's what you've named it - tunabananas?" he asked chuckling. setient smiled. "Yeh, it ...
[15:23:54] <b-ot> fetco: ag - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[15:23:55] <fetco> ... looks like a tunabananas. tunabananas the Colossal Cock!" they both burst into laughter. setient stroked the fat dong more vigorously. "You'd better stop before tunabananas spits up on you," yardena joked.
[15:23:58] <duch_kazatel> what the everloving christ.
[15:23:58] <fetco> They took turns washing each other's bodies and finally got out of the shower. setient studied her naked figure in the mirror. Her strong Italian features had become even more prominent over the last few years as she aged, and while she was pleased with what she saw, her desire for bigger breasts still lurked underneath. With everything that had taken place over the last few days, she saw that this was as good a time as any to ...
[15:24:00] <b-ot> fetco: bet - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[15:24:04] <fetco> ... make it a more serious discussion. "Honey, you remember the other day when I dropped you off that the station and we were joking around? And how I mentioned about getting bigger breasts? Do you think I'd look good with bigger ones? Maybe the size of dr_jesus_?" yardena was brushing his teeth at his sink and nearly choked on the toothpaste. He hurried up and spat it out. "Wha? You want to be the size of dr_jesus_?" he asked ...
[15:24:10] <b-ot> fetco: lookgoodwithbiggeron.es - ☺ AVAILABLE
[15:24:11] <fetco> ... breathlessly. In mere seconds, his cock was sticking straight out at full strength. setient laughed. "Well, I guess there's my answer, huh?" yardena grinned sheepishly. "I'm sorry. It's just that picturing you with dr_jesus_'s boobs ... wow ... I mean, you body is fantastic now, but those tits ... wow ..." he tried to step closer to her but the fat cock head stuck her squarely in the stomach and he couldn't get any closer. ...
[15:24:13] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: yeah wtf
[15:24:17] <fetco> ... "Hey! Watch where you poke that thing!" setient laughed, giving tunabananas a playful slap. The long, thick dong swayed gently back and forth and they both stood there watching it. "Sorry, just got a little excited, that's all," yardena said. "Hmmm sure," setient grinned.
[15:24:21] <fetco> She grabbed a bottle of baby oil off the sink and poured some along the full length of the shaft, then started to massage the oil in. yardena closed his eyes and reached out to brace himself on the wall. "With a cock this size, we've got to make sure we keep the skin well moisturized and cared for," setient said as she rubbed the oil all over the shaft and his huge scrotal sac. She rubbed the oil all over his body and when she was ...
[15:24:27] <fetco> ... finished, yardena did the same for her. He went slowly as he rubbed the oil across her big breasts, almost dreamily. "What's on your mind, big boy?" setient cooed. "Just thinking about much much bigger these could be, that's all," yardena said.
[15:24:34] <duch_kazatel> where are the mods?

[15:31:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm so confused :(
[15:32:44] <FrenchyLover_p> Hi
[15:32:51] <duch_kazatel> hullo
[15:33:08] <d0den> duch_kazatel, could you take one more look please? the stupid stuff is fixed now
[15:33:10] <FrenchyLover_p> is it faster to remove DOM element and create them again or to create them and hide them ?
[15:33:26] <nhulea> FrenchyLover_p: watch things have been weird in here
[15:33:34] <nhulea> out * jk
[15:33:34] <FrenchyLover_p> sorry I mean first create and after hide them
[15:33:50] <nhulea> :-)
[15:33:57] <FrenchyLover_p> or
[15:33:58] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: my guess is: for huge number of items, maybe creating is faster. for small number, hiding
[15:34:18] <FrenchyLover_p> ok
[15:34:28] <FrenchyLover_p> but there's no a lot of differences ?
[15:34:30] <duch_kazatel> d0den can't at the moment sorry.
[15:35:06] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: modifying the dom is a bit expensive in any case. document fragments can help minimize overhead, from what I've read anyway
[15:35:28] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 they can - but only if used correctly.
[15:35:38] <FrenchyLover_p> it's expensive for the client or the server ?
[15:35:43] <doug65536> client
[15:36:03] <FrenchyLover_p> in my computer, it's very fast, can it be very slow on a server ?
[15:36:06] <doug65536> and only problematic for large numbers of items. typical machine can instantly modify one item
[15:36:09] <duch_kazatel> uh....
[15:36:26] <duch_kazatel> FrenchyLover_p your question doesn't make sense - how would it slow down from a server?
[15:36:28] <FrenchyLover_p> I mean if I have access them from a server
[15:36:40] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: that is not possible
[15:36:41] <duch_kazatel> are you doing ajax, FrenchyLover_p?
[15:36:54] <FrenchyLover_p> duch_kazatel no just jquery
[15:37:08] <FrenchyLover_p> they are html pages
[15:37:26] <duch_kazatel> okay - javascript ONLY impacts the client, in that case.
[15:37:29] <FrenchyLover_p> but I will do ajax
[15:37:57] <FrenchyLover_p> is it more expensive for the server than a normal way ?
[15:38:02] <FrenchyLover_p> ajax
[15:38:12] <duch_kazatel> the only impact from the server is if you're pulling content via ajax, but modifying on page doesn't change anything.
[15:38:19] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you understand javascript.
[15:38:25] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: probably slightly cheaper - ajax responses are small
[15:38:37] <FrenchyLover_p> ok
[15:38:43] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: as long as you aren't spamming the server with requests frequently
[15:38:46] <FrenchyLover_p> duch_kazatel no I know javascript it's only client
[15:38:57] <FrenchyLover_p> but I wanted to be sure ^^
[15:39:05] <duch_kazatel> then how would basic javascript operations impact the server without ajax?
[15:39:10] <FrenchyLover_p> that what I'm thinking is good
[15:39:14] <grafi> nodejs would like to disagree with you
[15:39:26] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[15:39:34] <duch_kazatel> contextually we're talking about in-browser javascript.
[15:39:49] <sayd> is jquery-validation still the defacto for the most part?
[15:39:57] <snover> defacto what
[15:40:00] <grafi> standard
[15:40:02] <sayd> form validation
[15:40:03] <grafi> probably
[15:40:04] <duch_kazatel> jquery validation has never been a defacto anything.
[15:40:13] <FrenchyLover_p> what do guys use for debugging javascript ?
[15:40:22] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: chrome - press f12
[15:40:24] <sayd> snover grafi duch_kazatel is there one?
[15:40:27] <duch_kazatel> unless you're running server-side validation.
[15:40:28] <FrenchyLover_p> I use firebug
[15:40:38] <duch_kazatel> I use firebug, too
[15:40:40] <doug65536> FrenchyLover_p: firebug sucks compared to chrome debugger
[15:40:50] <grafi> debuggerwars!!
[15:40:50] <FrenchyLover_p> I don't have chrome ^^
[15:41:00] <davezZz> firebug and inspect element are good
[15:41:05] <davezZz> in combination
[15:41:07] <grafi> the chromedevtools look awesome when paul irish shows me what to do
[15:41:14] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[15:41:15] <doug65536> "debugger is already active in another window"   <-- firebug sucks
[15:41:20] <duch_kazatel> what?
[15:41:20] <grafi> in actuality im too confused to use them
[15:41:21] <grafi> ._.
[15:41:24] <davezZz> then deactivate it?
[15:41:36] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 - I've never seen that.
[15:42:33] <doug65536> besides that major issue, firebug is fine
[15:42:48] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 - I use firebug every day and have never seen that.
[15:43:21] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: you keep only one browser window with 1 tab open?
[15:43:34] <duch_kazatel> nope. firebug supports multiple browser sessions....
[15:43:39] <doug65536> if you debug more than one page, you're screwed with firebug
[15:43:46] <grafi> hm
[15:43:56] <duch_kazatel> uh, no.
[15:43:56] <grafi> so i cant have firebug open in 2 tabs?
[15:44:01] <duch_kazatel> you can.
[15:44:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm doing it right now
[15:44:19] <doug65536> yeah? you have sources loaded and you put breakpoints in both pages?
[15:44:27] <doug65536> and you ran both and you broke into the script in both?
[15:45:05] <grafi> cant speak for that :x
[15:45:28] <duch_kazatel> checking now.
[15:47:02] <doug65536> hey I would love to use firebug... chrome is unstable. but I am forced to by firebug limitations
[15:47:30] <duch_kazatel> when was the last time you checked that?
[15:47:36] <doug65536> 2 days ago
[15:47:39] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[15:47:50] <doug65536> are you on linux or windows or what?
[15:48:06] <duch_kazatel> windows.  and that specific use case is kind of insane.
[15:48:16] <duch_kazatel> i'll admit i've never actually done that, but I wouldn't ever need to i guess.
[15:48:16] <doug65536> I can assure you linux ff firebug sucks
[15:48:53] <doug65536> shouldn't matter but apparently it matters
[15:49:02] <duch_kazatel> what sort of environment are you in where you're debugging in two places like that at once?
[15:49:54] <doug65536> I'm not necessarily debugging both at once. but if some other window has it open, I'm screwed until I dig around and find it - and closing it won't necessarily work... I have to close the whole window - a pain
[15:50:12] <grafi> that really sucks oô
[15:50:35] <doug65536> with chrome I have infinite sessions all with their own undocked debugger UI
[15:50:59] <doug65536> so I can peek at another page's data while debugging this page
[15:51:09] <duch_kazatel> guess i'm obsessive with clearing breakpoints/closing out unused tabs/etc.
[15:51:39] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: and I'm the opposite - I end up with 50 tabs spread across a bunch of windows sometimes - not kidding
[15:51:54] <grafi> m
[15:51:56] <grafi> hm
[15:51:58] <duch_kazatel> sor surprising.  i've seen others do that.
[15:52:00] <grafi> bunch of windows
[15:52:09] <grafi> how many monitors do you have?
[15:52:13] <doug65536> the page, some fiddles, some searches, some documentation, some random other crap, a youtube.. etc
[15:52:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm not doubting that you do it mano.
[15:52:53] <duch_kazatel> just saying it sounds strange that limitation exists in firebug.
[15:54:26] <doug65536> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/57071
[15:54:36] <doug65536> various other failure messages can show up too
[15:54:55] <duch_kazatel> like i said, i've used it for years and never run into those problems.
[15:55:01] <duch_kazatel> not sure why you're still stuck on hating it ;)
[15:55:39] <doug65536> I said I wished I could use it - I don't hate it - but it's a totally unacceptable problem, even though it won't always reproduce
[15:55:55] <doug65536> chrome is unstable
[15:56:08] <jtal> chrome is unstable?
[15:56:14] <doug65536> jtal: yes
[15:56:14] <duch_kazatel> I can only think of one time chrome was unstable.
[15:56:19] <duch_kazatel> for me, at least.
[15:56:25] <duch_kazatel> what industry do you work in?
[15:56:27] <t0tht_-> hi
[15:56:38] <t0tht_-> can help me with basic auth and jquery?
[15:56:40] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: me?
[15:56:41] <t0tht_-> o try this.. http://pastebin.com/5MqVuCRZ
[15:56:42] <jtal> how is chrome unstable?
[15:56:46] <t0tht_-> but is not work
[15:56:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah, doug65536
[15:57:17] <doug65536> jtal: page goes blank and a mac-like monitor with X eyes that looks like it was poisoned comes up and says "sorry but something went wrong"
[15:57:39] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: software dev
[15:57:58] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 I assumed that - what industry?  ecommerce?  medical?  etc.
[15:58:32] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: I'm between jobs atm. last job was microsoft server division, engines & protocols
[15:58:42] <duch_kazatel> hah, makes sense then.
[15:58:52] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: what makes sense?
[15:58:58] <t0tht_-> any
[15:59:12] <duch_kazatel> you're probably more of a backend guy.
[15:59:13] <jtal> doug updated chrome? what os? I think you said linux?
[15:59:23] <doug65536> 25 years experience programmer having a problem with an unstable browser on a machine that runs for weeks on end with no issues? :)
[15:59:28] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:59:31] <duch_kazatel> not giving you shit mang.
[15:59:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying that you probably have different expectations out of things than I do.
[16:00:32] <doug65536> chrome is fast - and the html5 calendar is nice looking - and the debugger is good. that's all the nice things I can say about it :)
[16:01:54] <doug65536> outside the debugger, ff is almost completely perfectly stable
[16:02:24] <jsQuestion> for some reason my if (jqSlector.length === 0) {... } triggers in ie 7 and 8 when it is false in the major browsers. it's not a crazy selector $("span.message.validation") what could i be doing wrong
[16:02:31] <doug65536> I have done nasty things in the debugger that screwed ff up though
[16:02:37] <jsQuestion> http://jsfiddle.net/jX2qN/
[16:03:01] <grafi> yeah if you push it, sometimes it pushes back :p
[16:03:47] <t0tht_-> any?
[16:03:50] <t0tht_-> jqyery ajax beforesend
[16:06:34] <jsQuestion> any guidence? for some reason the .length check fails in ie7 and 8 both but works in modern browsers
[16:06:59] <jsQuestion> so i wind up appending another message span into the div
[16:07:32] <grafi> is .length not zero for some reason? have you checked?
[16:08:36] <jsQuestion> it IS zero because for some reason that selector doesn't find anything.
[16:09:28] <t0tht_->  "Access to restricted URI denied"  code: "1012" nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)"
[16:11:29] <t0tht_-> why?
[16:12:57] <Changa> How do I select a second tag that contains a certain text
[16:13:17] <bakers> Changa: sure... look at :contains
[16:13:30] <bakers> Changa: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[16:13:45] <Changa> been trying $( "b:contains('Tom')").eq(i).css( "border", "solid 1px red" );
[16:14:13] <grafi> whats b?
[16:14:14] <Changa> $( "b:contains('Tom')").css( "border", "solid 1px red" ); worked but for all Toms
[16:14:27] <Changa> its a <b> tag </b>
[16:14:37] <grafi> oh, ofc stupid me
[16:15:00] <Changa> bakers^
[16:19:42] <bakers> Changa: what's that eq(i) doing
[16:20:13] <Changa> bakers I want to select nth contains
[16:20:27] <Changa> eq is an attempt at selecting the second <b>Tom</b>
[16:20:46] <Mrgoose> is there a way to make a fullscreen dialog in jquery mobile?  THat's not like floating
[16:21:20] <bakers> Changa: http://jsfiddle.net/p6zhH/
[16:21:25] <doug65536> Mrgoose: my guess would be a position: fixed div with 0,0 top left, 100%,100% width,height
[16:22:13] <Changa> bakers: http://jsfiddle.net/p6zhH/1/ I want the second one.
[16:22:17] <Changa> only.
[16:22:20] <bakers> Changa: http://jsfiddle.net/p6zhH/2/
[16:23:14] <doug65536> Mrgoose: also make the dialog resizable: false
[16:23:39] <doug65536> Mrgoose: in .dialog(attr) attr object
[16:23:43] <Mrgoose> hmm
[16:24:00] <Changa> thanks bakers
[16:26:14] <Mrgoose> doug65536, doesnt seem to work well
[16:26:32] <Mrgoose> i'll keep playing around with it
[16:26:50] <doug65536> Mrgoose: what goes wrong?
[16:31:23] <Mrgoose> well it doesn't cover the whole screen
[16:34:41] <Mrgoose> i'll just use links that slide up
[16:34:56] <doug65536> Mrgoose: this is close http://jsfiddle.net/C9bZv/
[16:36:25] <Krambiorix> in a inner div i want to delete the div. So i have <div class="wrap" id="12345"><div onclick="deleteItem('12345')"></div></div>  .... In my deleteItem function i try $("#"+id).remove() but the element does not exist... Anyone any ideas???
[16:40:59] <doug65536> Mrgoose: http://jsfiddle.net/C9bZv/6/
[16:41:47] <Mrgoose> ah, thanks
[16:42:05] <nesoi> I'm using JQM and trying to create a messaging app. I'm using jquery scrollz to do lazy loading of listviews, but I actually need to load from the top so that the bottom is the most recent message, because that's what people are used to.  And jquery scrollz doesn't do that. Does anyone have an idea of what techniques would be good to make that work?
[16:42:17] <nesoi> or if there's another jquery mobile plugin which would work?
[16:53:37] <doug65536> Mrgoose: http://jsfiddle.net/C9bZv/13/
[16:53:51] <doug65536> Mrgoose: unbinds resize from window when closed
[16:55:49] <doug65536> Mrgoose: fiddle bug http://jsfiddle.net/C9bZv/17/
[17:07:06] <nesoi> so, anyone here know about JQM?
[17:07:20] <duch_kazatel> jqmodal?
[17:07:45] <nesoi> jquery mobile
[17:07:53] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[17:09:00] <qom2> so I have an element that works perfectly fine to click on my desktop, but on my iPhone nothing happens at all, I get a response if I set the on tap event to body, but not the element in question, what the hell could it be?
[17:10:56] <nesoi> but jqmodal looks interesting actually
[17:11:04] <nesoi> I wonder if it works with jq mobile
[17:12:43] <arschmitz> neosi: sounds like you just need to supply your data to scrollz in reverse order
[17:13:14] <nesoi> arschmitz:  I don't think so, because it doesn't have a topreached event which would allow more data to be loaded.
[17:13:25] <doug65536> qom2: show code please
[17:14:12] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/FyD5H1Mq any of these really..
[17:14:14] <doug65536> qom2: might need -webkit-appearance: none style on it
[17:15:06] <doug65536> qom2: lol, nice alert messages
[17:15:23] <qom2> :(
[17:15:40] <jschall> why doesn't this work?
[17:15:40] <jschall> $('body').on('click', ':not(#popup)', function(){$('#popup').hide()});
[17:16:18] <doug65536> qom2: try adding -webkit-appearance: none style to problem element
[17:16:26] <jschall> also tried these changes: $('body').on('click', '*:not(#popup, #popup *)', function(){$('#popup').hide()});
[17:16:42] <qom2> it only disappeared doug65536, but I suppose that's the thing that should happen?
[17:16:45] <nesoi> arschmitz:  so I'm wondering if there's an alternative plugin I could use… I looked at the code for jquery scrollz but it's beyond me
[17:17:01] <shoky> jschall: probably because the clicked element is some element inside #popup, and not #poup itself
[17:17:16] <nesoi> arschmitz:  that is, beyond me to add that feature
[17:17:37] <jschall> shoky: i tested that by printing e.target - i am clicking on #popup
[17:17:37] <doug65536> qom2: really? oh
[17:17:59] <duch_kazatel> jschall - what about $('body').on('click', '*:not(#popup)', function(){$('#popup').hide()});
[17:18:05] <shoky> jschall: it's probably better to not use a selector there, and just handle clicks on #popup (seperately) and call event.stopPropagation() there
[17:18:19] <duch_kazatel> that works too.
[17:18:22] <jschall> shoky: ahhhh
[17:18:27] <doug65536> qom2: I remember click activity not working on iphone without it... Guess my memory is off
[17:18:34] * tw2113 sides with whatever shoky says, all the time
[17:18:53] <jschall> shoky: good idea. i'm still curious why the selector isn't working...
[17:19:01] <shoky> tho if #popup was the target element i donno why it didn't work. let's see..
[17:21:21] <Ernest> hi
[17:21:23] <mitchdotpro> Hey guys! Is there any reason that if I click on an input it gains focus, but when I tab into it it doesn't?
[17:22:45] <Ernest> 	currentItem = $(this).find('.shopid');
[17:23:04] <shoky> jschall: working fine here http://jsfiddle.net/n8dHK/
[17:23:11] <Ernest> i am trying to find $('#topten .toptenlist li .shopid').text();
[17:23:19] <Ernest> but with (this)
[17:23:23] <Ernest> not every li,
[17:23:52] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/
[17:23:55] <Ernest> how do i select a element value of $(this)
[17:24:07] <Ernest> $(this .shopid)
[17:24:14] <blindMoe> .children
[17:24:21] <doug65536> .find
[17:24:25] <Ernest> tried find
[17:24:28] <Ernest> did bugger all
[17:24:33] <doug65536> $(this).find('.shopid')
[17:24:44] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: Yeah, and I thought it would work as well, but in my case it's not. Maybe it has something to do with the Twitter Bootstrap popover? :-\
[17:24:50] <blindMoe> Ernest: then your selector is screwed or it gave you an array when you thought you were getting an element
[17:24:52] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: show code?
[17:24:57] <Ernest> $(this).find('.shopid');
[17:25:05] <mitchdotpro> Will see if I can replicate on that fiddle you wrote, sec
[17:25:06] <Ernest> looks the same as what ihad :s
[17:25:11] <Ernest> or am i missing something
[17:25:14] <shoky> `demo @ Ernest
[17:25:15] <b-ot> Ernest: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:25:29] <blindMoe> Ernest: add .first() to the end of that
[17:25:35] <blindMoe> but yeah.. demo
[17:25:41] <Ernest> returns object
[17:26:16] <doug65536> Ernest: I assure you , find works. need to see more of code
[17:26:26] <doug65536> or some of the relevant html
[17:26:49] <Ernest> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/57/
[17:27:12] <Ernest> in the JS line 23
[17:27:32] <Ernest> this parts controls the shop to display
[17:27:46] <blindMoe> I don't see a .find on that line
[17:27:54] <Ernest> not on this version no
[17:28:03] <duch_kazatel> and don't use .click, use .on
[17:28:03] <Ernest> on my local yeah
[17:28:22] <Ernest> basically am trying to make the page goto the shopId
[17:28:36] <duch_kazatel> and with that i go
[17:28:45] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: Yeah, seems a popover bug maybe? http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/1/
[17:29:30] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: I get focus events from tab on that fiddle. you don't?
[17:29:51] <Ernest> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/58/ this is the new version
[17:29:53] <mitchdotpro> I get the #log append, but not the popover.
[17:30:18] <Ernest> jesus i find it hard to explain what am even trying to achieve
[17:30:28] <Ernest> in a language people can understand anyway :(
[17:32:09] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: that's pretty weird...
[17:32:58] <Ernest> well switching from .click to .on surely did not help at all
[17:33:05] <Ernest> infact it broke it :
[17:33:15] <blindMoe> .on('click', ..   ?
[17:33:22] <doug65536> Ernest: he meant on('click', ...)
[17:33:29] <blindMoe> I don't think he was trying to say it would fix more.. it is more a a best practice
[17:33:39] <blindMoe> man Magento is pissing me off right now
[17:33:48] <doug65536> Ernest: click(  is stupid name. looks like code makes a click happen
[17:33:51] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: I thought so too
[17:34:12] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/6/ If you check your console on that one the events are definitely taking place which is even weirder.
[17:34:13] <Ernest> this selector thing is a pain
[17:35:37] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: I tried putting a gun to its head: http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/7/   same thing
[17:35:45] <blindMoe> Ernest: still haven't explained what it is you want to do
[17:35:48] <Ernest> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/58/   < JS - line 25
[17:35:58] <blindMoe> also that jsfiddle doesn't work because json.shops doesn't exist
[17:36:24] <Ernest> what i want is the '.shopId' text balue
[17:36:26] <Ernest> value
[17:36:28] <blindMoe> Ernest: what about line 25?  Elaborate on what you want to accomplish
[17:36:47] <Ernest> i want each click to goto the correct page / shopId
[17:36:51] <Ernest> currently am using index()
[17:36:57] <Ernest> which is of no use
[17:37:03] <Ernest> as the list is sorted
[17:37:29] <Ernest> so what am trying to do is select the clicked li's .shopId value
[17:37:59] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: I went the other way and tried to setup the popover first and then hide/show -- http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/9/ - now it seems to fail on click instead?
[17:38:14] <Ernest> ive tried $(this).children('.shopId');
[17:38:20] <Apane> hey, looking for feedback or an upvote :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6176525 anything helps man.
[17:38:47] <Ernest> i need a smoke, may refresh my head
[17:39:07] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: it fails randomly both ways too
[17:39:32] <Ernest> brb
[17:39:34] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: click might blink the popover - tab might blink the popover
[17:39:56] <nesoi> ok so I'm looking at the code for jquery scrollz (https://github.com/zippy1978/jquery.scrollz/blob/master/dist/jquery.scrollz.js) and there's this line if ((container.scrollTop() + container.height() + 1) >= container.get(0).scrollHeight) {
[17:40:59] <nesoi> so that triggers "bottomreached". If I want to create a topreached event, would it just be container.scrollTop() = 0? or what would it be?
[17:42:32] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: click is doing something funny: http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/11/
[17:42:36] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: spam click one
[17:43:24] <mitchdotpro> Yeah, that's weird. It's like click is making things go crazy.
[17:43:52] <blindMoe> Ernest: http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/59/
[17:44:30] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: GOT IT! http://jsfiddle.net/WsUgt/15/
[17:44:48] <mitchdotpro> I saw nothing in the docs about a trigger option, but found it on another fiddle
[17:44:50] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: nice
[17:45:18] <mitchdotpro> doug65536: Stoked, thanks for the help man, would never have found it bashing at it alone. :-)
[17:45:25] <doug65536> mitchdotpro: np :)
[17:49:59] <nesoi> in this line if ((container.scrollTop() + container.height() + 1) >= container.get(0).scrollHeight) {, scrollTop is how far down we've scrolled, container.height is the # of lines in the container, but container.get(0).scrollHeight is what exactly… the total # of lines in the container?
[17:51:45] <gho5t> anyone have experience in cross-domain uploads with an iframe
[17:52:10] <doug65536> gho5t: you probably need to send a header that allows it from the destination server
[17:52:30] <doug65536> gho5t: why iframe though? to try to work around cross domain stuff?
[17:52:48] <gho5t> well the iframe is to simulate an ajax file upload
[17:53:02] <gho5t> I have CORS enabled
[17:53:06] <gho5t> shouldn't that suffice
[17:53:08] <gho5t> hmm
[17:53:58] <doug65536> gho5t: so the server that receives the upload post is sending Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[17:54:18] <gho5t> it's configured to do so yes
[17:54:24] <gho5t> but let me double check the response
[17:54:29] <doug65536> gho5t: did you look at debugger. yea
[17:54:49] <doug65536> gho5t: common mistake is not having mod_headers loaded in apache
[17:56:18] <doug65536> gho5t: without mod_headers, the directives might be there, but they won't do anything
[17:57:02] <gho5t> doug65536: gotcha but this is for IIS
[17:57:16] <doug65536> gho5t: I was afraid you might say that :|
[17:57:28] <doug65536> gho5t: the headers are there though?
[17:57:59] <gho5t> ok I know what I need to
[17:58:01] <gho5t> do
[17:58:07] <gho5t> you were right the headers weren't present
[17:58:17] <gho5t> it should be reading Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[17:58:21] <gho5t> like some of my other pages
[17:58:36] <gho5t> but I did the upload controller differently
[17:58:49] <gho5t> by not using WebAPI and instead using a normal MVC controller
[17:59:02] <gho5t> apparently this CORS attribute is only for WebAPI
[17:59:41] <gho5t> thanks for putting me on the right path
[18:04:53] <Ernest> hi

[18:19:02] <Ernest> i have noticed a slight issue though
[18:19:05] <Ernest>          $('#coffeeshop').on('pagebeforeshow', function() {
[18:19:05] <Ernest>            $(this).find('[data-role=header] .ui-title').text(json.shops[currentItem].shopName);
[18:19:05] <Ernest> 				$('.shopid').html(json.shops[currentItem].shopId);
[18:19:05] <Ernest> 				$('address').html(json.shops[currentItem].shopAddress);
[18:19:05] <Ernest> 				$('.shopdes').html(json.shops[currentItem].shopDes);
[18:19:27] <Ernest> hi
[18:19:28] <Ernest> sorry
[18:19:47] <Ernest> not used to this laptop yet
[18:20:21] <opc0de> hi, sorry, i'm looking for to have a "ui-icon-grip-diagonal-se" on my dialog, anyone have an article/url/etc for that ?
[18:20:33] <gho5t> doug65536: hmm still getting that error
[18:20:41] <gho5t> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[18:20:52] <gho5t> Blocked a frame with origin "http://localhost:9000" from accessing a frame with origin "http://localhost:56960". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
[18:21:23] <Ernest> blindMoe are you still here?
[18:23:21] <doug65536> gho5t: which browser?
[18:23:29] <gho5t> chrome
[18:24:25] <gho5t> doug65536: it's weird that I can see the response of "File uploaded successfully" in the dev tools
[18:24:31] <gho5t> but in the console I'm getting that error
[18:24:44] <doug65536> gho5t: should be a space before the * right?
[18:24:48] <Ernest> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/60/
[18:25:30] <Ernest> when you click, Top 10, then a link, and return, the shopid on the right in red changes all
[18:25:50] <doug65536> gho5t: I doubt the space matters though
[18:25:56] <gho5t> yeah
[18:26:00] <doug65536> gho5t: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-header
[18:31:15] <filkinst_> is there anything wrong with this if statement?
[18:31:19] <filkinst_>     if (imgWidth < 600) {
[18:31:19] <filkinst_>         var newWidth = ((imgWidth / 600) * 300);
[18:31:19] <filkinst_>         $(this).css({
[18:31:20] <filkinst_>             "width":newWidth
[18:31:22] <filkinst_>         });
[18:31:24] <filkinst_>     }
[18:31:51] <gho5t> doug65536:  isn't a bit weird that I can see the response in the dev tools?
[18:32:12] <Ernest> n/m i solved it
[18:32:22] <Ernest> it was another selector interfering
[18:33:02] <doug65536> gho5t: it's not weird
[18:33:13] <doug65536> gho5t: the cross-origin is enforced on the client side
[18:33:32] <doug65536> gho5t: browser inspects header and if it doesn't like it, cancels the request
[18:34:01] <gho5t> right but I'm saying the response is coming back
[18:34:06] <gho5t> in the dev tools
[18:34:11] <doug65536> gho5t: yes, re-read what I just said
[18:34:12] <gho5t> network panel
[18:34:20] <gho5t> ok
[18:34:20] <doug65536> cross-domain is enforced on client side
[18:34:42] <gho5t> not sure if client side is the right word
[18:34:47] <gho5t> but I see
[18:34:54] <doug65536> the guys browser
[18:34:59] <doug65536> how do you interpret client side?
[18:35:19] <gho5t> client side being the client
[18:35:23] <gho5t> the browser is the client
[18:35:26] <gho5t> and can see the response
[18:35:30] <gho5t> in dev tools
[18:35:33] <doug65536> no, can see headers
[18:35:37] <doug65536> response is dropped
[18:35:49] <gho5t> ok
[18:35:53] <gho5t> hm
[18:35:54] <doug65536> anyway, regardless of debugger - javascript can't see response
[18:36:06] <gho5t> the header is there
[18:36:09] <gho5t> what gives
[18:36:18] <doug65536> what I said at 21:33
[18:36:28] <doug65536> the *client* enforces cross domain access control
[18:36:45] <doug65536> the server *allows* it by putting that header there
[18:36:52] <doug65536> browser checks header to see if it is ok
[18:36:56] <doug65536> if not ok, fail the ajax
[18:37:17] <doug65536> in all cases the server sends the data
[18:37:21] <gho5t> ok gotcha
[18:37:24] <gho5t> but still
[18:37:29] <gho5t> the header is there
[18:37:37] <gho5t> so what be givin
[18:37:38] <doug65536> oh that header....
[18:37:44] <gho5t> yah
[18:37:51] <doug65536> yeah I was thinking you thought the http headers were there so its all good
[18:38:08] <doug65536> the headers are there even when its bad
[18:38:37] <doug65536> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* is there you mean
[18:38:53] <doug65536> I've read somewhere that * might not work...
[18:39:04] <doug65536> there is a way to configure apache to send a header that will always work
[18:39:09] <doug65536> don't know about IIS
[18:40:15] <doug65536> hey
[18:40:26] <doug65536> will those uploads always come from a specific domain's page?
[18:40:42] <gho5t> unfortunately no
[18:40:48] <gho5t> this is going to be a service for mobile apps
[18:40:54] <gho5t> but here's the thing
[18:41:03] <gho5t> I have another page that makes a call to the same service
[18:41:07] <gho5t> but a different method
[18:41:08] <doug65536> gho5t: I'm not sure you understand the question
[18:41:13] <gho5t> and it can
[18:41:18] <gho5t> get the data
[18:41:25] <gho5t> without cors it would fail
[18:41:36] <gho5t> it's showing the same header
[18:41:48] <doug65536> what do you mean by service?
[18:41:55] <doug65536> some API that random devs use?
[18:42:12] <gho5t> it's just a service
[18:42:13] <gho5t> REST
[18:42:15] <gho5t> hosted somewhere
[18:42:24] <gho5t> different devices need to access it
[18:42:36] <doug65536> you probably misinterpreted the question...
[18:42:36] <gho5t> whether mobile or laptop etc
[18:42:43] <doug65536> the page doing that iframe upload...
[18:42:43] <gho5t> perhaps
[18:42:49] <doug65536> will it always be on your site
[18:43:01] <gho5t> it's not
[18:43:03] <doug65536> even if some dude in another country is using it
[18:43:07] <gho5t> no
[18:43:17] <gho5t> sorry
[18:43:20] <gho5t> it's a phonegap app
[18:43:26] <doug65536> omg
[18:43:52] <doug65536> so I can make a page on whatever.com that uploads through that iframe can I?
[18:44:04] <gho5t> ?
[18:44:06] <gho5t> no
[18:44:10] <doug65536> exactly
[18:44:11] <gho5t> the iframe is installed in the phone gap app
[18:44:19] <gho5t> phone gap is html/css/js
[18:44:23] <gho5t> installed as an app on a phone
[18:44:31] <gho5t> and needs to connect to a service hosted somewhere
[18:44:35] <gho5t> through rest end points
[18:44:35] <doug65536> you're running page from http://?
[18:44:38] <doug65536> or file:///
[18:44:41] <gho5t> http
[18:45:01] <doug65536> can I see the page?
[18:45:07] <gho5t> no
[18:45:09] <gho5t> lol
[18:45:11] <gho5t> dude
[18:45:13] <gho5t> it's an app
[18:45:15] <gho5t> installed on my phone
[18:45:17] <gho5t> that i am devving
[18:45:22] <gho5t> it is not on some website
[18:45:34] <gho5t> have you used phone gap before
[18:45:37] <doug65536> so if it's an app why screw with browsers?
[18:45:42] <gho5t> have you used phone gap before
[18:45:56] <doug65536> open a connection and send the file
[18:46:00] <gho5t> have you used phone gap before
[18:46:04] <doug65536> no
[18:46:06] <gho5t> k
[18:46:08] <gho5t> didn't think so
[18:46:16] <gho5t> phonegap only allows you to use js
[18:46:20] <gho5t> html and css
[18:46:33] <gho5t> you make a web app and install it like an ordinary app
[18:46:41] <doug65536> tell me how your "app" is running from http:// address
[18:47:14] <Pavlov>  <content src="http://www.google.com"/>
[18:47:19] <gho5t> well in android it creates an app that contains a WebViewer
[18:47:23] <gho5t> or whatever it's called in Java
[18:47:27] <doug65536> seriously, I'm not being difficult :)
[18:47:39] <gho5t> and then creates the apk file
[18:47:53] <doug65536> so if I am inside a Faraday shield and there's no wireless, this http:// thing works?
[18:48:52] <doug65536> seriously
[18:49:06] <Pavlov> doug65536: you need to use app cache manifests, localstorage, etc
[18:49:11] <doug65536> I'm trying to get you to say, "oh no, it connects to some webserver"
[18:49:21] <gho5t> doug65536: yes
[18:49:26] <gho5t> think of it as a java app
[18:49:36] <gho5t> java has a concept of a WebView
[18:49:44] <gho5t> if the html files are stored within that jar
[18:49:49] <gho5t> it can access them locally
[18:50:01] <CWSpear> Is there a way to get the Year Select to show more dates in the ui-datepicker? I'm using it for birthdays, so I'd like the last to show more than just 10 years ago
[18:50:04] <gho5t> it only needs internet/cell service to connect to remote services
[18:50:05] <gho5t> PhoneGap is an web-based mobile development framework, based on the open-source Cordova project. PhoneGap allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to...
[18:50:07] <gho5t> ...access each device's sensors, data, and network status.
[18:50:25] <doug65536> gho5t: just for a test, can you put the upload form on the same page - to see if the iframe has something to do with the problem?
[18:50:42] <gho5t> yeah
[18:50:58] <doug65536> gho5t: because it seems like you have it setup right
[18:53:14] <gho5t> doug65536: yeah it works when on the same page
[18:53:25] <gho5t> I get an alert reading "file uploaded successfully."
[18:53:52] <doug65536> hmm, is the main page and the iframe page coming from the same domain and port?
[18:54:28] <doug65536> and same protocol (http)
[18:54:34] <opc0de> someone to help me ? please
[18:54:37] <gho5t> yes cause you just asked me to put it there
[18:54:50] <opc0de> i'm looking for to have a "ui-icon-grip-diagonal-se" on my dialog
[18:54:54] <doug65536> no I mean when it's in iframe
[18:56:00] <gho5t> no man
[18:56:07] <gho5t> iframe is hosted in the phone gap app
[18:56:14] <gho5t> to enable ajax-like uploads
[18:56:18] <filkinst_> does anyone know why newWidth isn't getting passed to the "width" attribute?
[18:56:20] <filkinst_>     if (imgWidth < 600) {
[18:56:20] <filkinst_>         var newWidth = ((imgWidth / 600) * 300);
[18:56:20] <filkinst_>         alert(newWidth)
[18:56:22] <filkinst_>         $(this).css({
[18:56:24] <filkinst_>             "width":newWidth
[18:56:26] <filkinst_>         });
[18:56:28] <filkinst_>     }
[18:56:39] <doug65536> filkinst_: that's a good way to get kicked. please use jsfiddle.com or something
[18:57:02] <filkinst_> oh sorry, i'm new here
[18:57:08] <doug65536> filkinst_: alert is missing ;
[18:58:35] <filkinst_> still the same result with the ;
[18:58:47] <filkinst_> am i allowed to paste links to a stackoverflow question?
[18:58:54] <doug65536> filkinst_: yes
[18:59:03] <doug65536> filkinst_: all links are fine
[18:59:18] <doug65536> just don't scroll everyone else off the screen :)
[18:59:32] <filkinst_> haha ok
[18:59:49] <filkinst_> heres the question I posted on stackoverflow regarding the if statement http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18116701/jquery-css-not-working-in-if-statement
[18:59:52] <doug65536> gho5t: is it feasible to make the main page and the iframe page be the same protocol, domain, and port?
[19:00:44] <gho5t> doug65536: thanks for the help man
[19:00:53] <gho5t> but you don't seem to get the issue
[19:01:08] <doug65536> gho5t: please tell me the issue
[19:01:22] <gho5t> iframe lives on the phone gap app
[19:01:26] <gho5t> on a phone
[19:01:31] <gho5t> trying to upload a file to remote server
[19:01:51] <gho5t> so of course I can't make them the same protocol domain and port
[19:01:57] <doug65536> where is the other page from then (the one that isn't the iframe)
[19:02:07] <gho5t> it's just a container for the iframe
[19:03:20] <gho5t> doug65536: http://viralpatel.net/blogs/ajax-style-file-uploading-using-hidden-iframe/
[19:05:30] <doug65536> gho5t: yes I understand how form file uploads work...
[19:05:53] <doug65536> I am going on and on about the domain etc being the same because browsers do that to block malicious exploits
[19:06:03] <gho5t> omg
[19:06:07] <gho5t> no
[19:06:17] <gho5t> i sent you that because that is the technique i'm using
[19:06:20] <gho5t> of using an iframe
[19:06:25] <gho5t> to simulate ajax
[19:06:34] <gho5t> and i know that browsers block that
[19:06:39] <gho5t> which is why i have the cors header
[19:06:42] <gho5t> remember?
[19:07:30] <doug65536> what does the file upload server get as the referrer?
[19:07:45] <gho5t> doesn't matter
[19:07:50] <gho5t> i'm allowing wildcard
[19:07:57] <doug65536> wildcard won't always work
[19:08:30] <gho5t> why
[19:11:09] <doug65536> is HTTP authentication involved at all?
[19:12:05] <doug65536> I don't know exactly why. but with apache, you can configure it to echo the referrer back as the allowed origin with this:
[19:12:06] <doug65536> Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "%{HTTP_ORIGIN}e" env=HTTP_ORIGIN
[19:12:53] <doug65536> browsers are required to send Origin: header when they do a cross-domain request
[19:13:16] <doug65536> that rewrites the header to echo back that whatever origin you are is explicitly allowed
[19:13:40] <doug65536> * should work sure, but I've read in numerous places that it won't always work
[19:13:51] <doug65536> nobody ever cites exactly why
[19:14:57] <doug65536> maybe you can find a way to tell IIS to echo back the Origin header as Access-Control-Allow-Origin value
[19:19:20] <gho5t> k well I was able to get the upload to work
[19:19:26] <gho5t> by removing the stupid iframe
[19:19:33] <gho5t> and just doing a normal form submit
[19:19:41] <gho5t> not sure why but that iframe is fucking shit up
[19:19:43] <doug65536> gho5t: it might even be a browser bug
[19:19:50] <gho5t> that would be interesting
[19:19:53] <doug65536> what you are doing is supposed to work
[19:19:57] <gho5t> although firefox is doing the same garbage
[19:20:06] <doug65536> who tests iframes, they are obsolete, except file uploads
[19:22:53] <doug65536> gho5t:  if you could put the upload form on a page on the upload target server, and just point the iframe at it, I think it would always work
[19:23:14] <gho5t> that's a good point
[19:34:44] <LoneSoldier728> how do I use a variable
[19:35:10] <LoneSoldier728> that keeps incrementing
[19:35:26] <LoneSoldier728> in a jquery append
[19:43:43] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone able to look at this?
[19:43:54] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/xy8xRrwD
[19:44:07] <LoneSoldier728> I am not sure how to make the .remove() command work
[20:28:53] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18117213/how-to-create-additional-fields-and-remove-them-from-a-form
[20:28:57] <LoneSoldier728> anyone able to answer that
[21:24:29] <b0ss_> Hey I have this code: http://pastebin.com/cC3Js74r and I need a script to alert a message " hello #id " according to the clicked link. How do I do it ?
[21:36:16] <doug65536> b0ss_: 1 sec
[21:41:50] <b0ss_> Doug: I just figure it out how
[21:41:52] <b0ss_> thanks anyways
[21:44:58] <doug65536> b0ss_: http://jsfiddle.net/Kcd3s/5/
[21:47:16] <b0ss_> doug65536: nevertheless that code works for all anchors on the page, even if it was not " link#" , right ?
[21:47:35] <doug65536> b0ss_: yes, you didn't give a requirement for that
[21:47:46] <b0ss_> ok, thanks anyways.
[21:47:59] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/Kcd3s/6/
[21:48:10] <doug65536> this one only does anchors whose id begins with link
[21:48:56] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/Kcd3s/7/
[21:49:31] <doug65536> b0ss_: ^^
[21:51:03] <b0ss_> thanks again
[22:17:16] <louism2wash> Hello all, does anyone have any idea how to use images in a select drop down?  I want users to be able to choose the color of an item they want and I would like those colors to be the values in the drop down.  Thanks.
[22:23:12] <Snerf> louism2wash, tried the select2 project?
[22:23:40] <louism2wash> Snerf: I have not.  I am new to Jquery ui is that on their site?
[22:23:55] <Snerf> its not part of jqueryui .. http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[22:24:15] <Snerf> it allows you to add images, all sorts of goodies..
[22:24:41] <fat> how do i make "one", "two", "three" in a div in html, not the javascript? http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/Wjjnd/
[22:27:00] <louism2wash> Snerf: Awesome, they even have a ruby gem.  Thanks for the info.
[22:28:20] <Snerf> np
[22:29:00] <fat> ?
[23:15:02] <epicowl> how can I access the return value of a jquery ajax call outside that call? e.g. I want to save data to a variable and use it outside .ajax().done(function(data){ myvar = data})
[23:15:31] <Cork> epicowl: generically, you can't
[23:15:59] <Cork> ajax is async, and that means the callback is called later then when your code flow
[23:16:06] <epicowl> Cork: mm, I thought there were ways to do this
[23:16:23] <epicowl> is this what promise/deferreds are for/
[23:16:34] <Cork> epicowl: sure, you can make the call sync, but then the page will frees until the call finish
[23:16:55] <Cork> epicowl: they have the exact same behavior as done
[23:17:02] <Cork> you can return the response from $.ajax
[23:17:12] <Cork> but you still need to use a callback to access the data
[23:17:14] <epicowl> that is what Im trying to do
[23:17:22] <epicowl> I need it to return a json object
[23:17:27] <Cork> you can't
[23:17:34] <Cork> you can return the promise
[23:17:44] <Cork> and from the promise bind a callback handler
[23:17:50] <Cork> and in the callback handler access the json
[23:18:26] <Cork> function request() { return $.ajax(); }; $().click(function() { request().done(function() {}); });
[23:19:12] <epicowl> http://dpaste.com/1335238/
[23:19:34] <Cork> like i said, you can't return the data like that
[23:19:43] <epicowl> damn
[23:20:01] <epicowl> I know Ive dealt with this same problem awhile ago… haven't been doing much js lately
[23:20:55] <Cork> the flow will be getData() => $.ajax call starts => console.log('here') => console.log(@data) => return @data => "network": response => done triggers => @data = data
[23:21:23] <Cork> epicowl: best option is to make the code you handle accept async data flows
[23:21:54] <Cork> epicowl: an option is to change the ajax call to be sync, but like i said, that means the page freezes until the response comes
[23:22:06] <Cork> and you REALLY shouldn't go that way
[23:22:06] <epicowl> yeah I can't have that
[23:22:14] <Cork> then you only have one option
[23:22:16] <Cork> async
[23:25:33] <epicowl> I think I need to rethink how I was going to write this
[23:26:14] <epicowl> http://dpaste.com/1335246/ L74 was going to just grab all the values I needed from server
[23:36:00] <Cork> epicowl: you could solve it with $.when
[23:36:31] <Cork> use $.when to wait for all the async calls to finish and then you can grab the data
[23:38:35] <BeardlessOne> hello!
[23:53:28] <doug65536> epicowl: depends
[23:53:41] <doug65536> lol
[23:54:28] <BeardedOne_> signs of intelligent life!
[23:55:06] <Cork> BeardedOne_: if you want help you need to ask the question
[23:55:15] <Cork> if you don't you won't see much
[23:55:40] <Cork> and hello/hi/similar is just spam, and normally doens't mean anything on irc
[23:56:16] <Cork> (especially as some clients automate it, and the user might not even be sitting by the computer)
[23:56:33] <BeardedOne_> oh, this is one of *those* channels. hello/hi/similar isn't always spam
[23:56:54] <Cork> BeardedOne_: on support channels it is
[23:57:15] <Cork> when you've responded to it for the 100'th+ time and no response you start to ignore it
[23:57:58] <BeardedOne_> I don't agree with that but lets agree to disagree. I don't have a question right now, but I'll keep this channel in mind for when I do have one.
[23:58:23] <Cork> ...
