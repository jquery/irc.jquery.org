[00:49:54] <daveee123> var test = $("a[href='#link']") if there is no href='#link', what will be returned? would the variable test be null, or would the code have a problem running?
[00:51:05] <Robdgreat> daveee123: it wouldn't be null. It would be a jQuery object with 0 length
[00:51:49] <daveee123> Robdgreat: does that mean that in an if statement like if(test){this would not run?}
[00:52:43] <Robdgreat> pretty sure an empty jquery object evaluates truthy. if(test.length) {this would not run}
[00:53:10] <Robdgreat> I think. It's trivial for you to verify :)
[03:16:03] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:16:25] <jomofcw> Is there something that explain why a click event on a LABEL element doesn't bubble to its parents, please ?
[03:17:36] <Cork> it does
[03:17:42] <Cork> so no :)
[03:18:34] <jomofcw> Cork mroning :D !
[03:19:23] <jomofcw> Hm... i've got a double problem... I'm providing you a codepen.
[03:19:34] <Cork> jsfiddle please
[03:22:11] <jomofcw> Ones prefr codepen, the others jsfiddle... I'm lost :x.0
[03:23:39] <Woet> i just hate the one that takes over your tab control
[03:23:42] <Woet> dont recall the name
[03:24:17] <Cork> ya, that is annoying, but tools that keeps losing changes is worse
[03:24:23] <Woet> ah, jsbin. definitely don't use that one.
[03:25:21] <jomofcw> https://jsfiddle.net/3g9Lmaok/1/
[03:25:27] <jomofcw> It works in this test case :/
[03:25:51] <jomofcw> Just appear the CSS problem (cursor:pointer doesn't apply to label) and the alert show twice.
[03:26:01] <Woet> jomofcw: congrats, now you figured out that the issue isn't in the code you thought it was
[03:26:15] <Cork> i would start by making sure the html markup is valid
[03:26:34] <Cork> and after that checking if any other css is messing with it
[03:26:59] <jomofcw> Yup, i'll do that.
[03:31:30] <jomofcw> OK, the problem is that the same that the alert appear twice when I wait it once (in fact, I use a toggle things... so, the first one show the element, but the second that trigger right after the first hide my element).
[03:41:39] <jomofcw> https://jsfiddle.net/jomofcw/3g9Lmaok/4/ with console log instead of alert, less anoying ^you can see that the console log appear twice for each click.
[03:41:49] <jomofcw> I wonder why...
[03:43:22] <Cork> jomofcw: https://jsfiddle.net/3g9Lmaok/5/
[03:44:01] <Cork> i recommend changing it to <input type="radio" id="the-id"><label for="the-id">Test</label>
[03:44:20] <Cork> jomofcw: click on labels fires a click on inputs
[03:44:29] <Cork> so you get two clicks for each click
[03:44:49] <Cork> (this is a dom legacy werdity that click on label fires a click on input)
[03:47:28] <jomofcw> Cork Ok I get it. But my event isn't listening on the LABEL but on the LI, so, it won't fix it there. So I probably need to listen for click on input and avoid it to bubble.
[03:48:56] <jomofcw> Oh, I guess you didn't say that to fix it, just to advice me how to do it with a correct structure ^^.
[03:49:18] <jomofcw> Anywa, thanks for your help ! I know now why it trigger twice.0
[03:49:19] <Cork> jomofcw: yes but event bubbles
[03:49:35] <Cork> so you get one event bubbling from the span; and one event bubbling from the input
[03:50:10] <Cork> or rather span > label (fork) > li ; span > label > li
[03:50:25] <jomofcw> Hmmmmm... yea, better than avoiding the event to bublle I probably may look at the event.target instead !
[03:50:48] <Cork> jomofcw: no, that is a bad idea
[03:50:55] <jomofcw> erf, why :s ?
[03:51:07] <Cork> cause then clicking the input won't do anything
[03:56:26] <jomofcw> Cork hmmmm... if i just set a condition that if the click trigger on the input I don't do my stuff, it will just work as usual, nop ?
[03:57:26] <jomofcw> Hm... better, I will make some test before the toggle I use, to know if I have to do it in this context or not.
[03:58:12] <Cork> jomofcw: but you can't separate it like that as the browser will start a separate event on the input
[03:58:35] <Cork> so with the markup you have right now you will either have two events or can't click on the dot of the input
[04:05:23] <jomofcw> Cork you right ! I fixed it using control in my stuff but not event dependant.
[04:34:57] <dimi1947> in this fiddle you will see various inputs:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/oy9ck4wz/137/   my question is the code in line 229 what input does it target?
[04:36:35] <jomofcw> dimi1947 every input that contain dataid
[04:36:52] <jomofcw> *as value
[04:36:58] <dimi1947> jonofcw:is there such an input in the DOM?
[04:37:07] <jomofcw> dimi1947 depend on the context.
[04:37:19] <jomofcw> depend on what is dataid
[04:37:33] <Cork> it looks for data-name
[04:37:47] <Cork> it splits that attribute into name and id (the last digit)
[04:38:09] <dimi1947> Cork:it does not look for data-name
[04:38:19] <Cork> dimi1947: line 226
[04:38:59] <Cork> so baiscally it converts things like <input data-name="price0"> and converts it to <input name="form[update][price][0]">
[04:38:59] <dimi1947> Cork:no....I am talking about the code in line 22
[04:39:11] <dimi1947> 229
[04:39:17] <Cork> "my question is the code in line 229 what input does it target?"
[04:39:27] <Cork> ya, and it uses the info from line 226
[04:39:38] <dimi1947> give me a minute to see it again
[04:40:03] <Cork> ah, no dataid is way way earlier
[04:40:14] <dimi1947> Cork:exactly...
[04:40:17] <Cork> data-service
[04:40:33] <dimi1947> data-id is allways a number
[04:40:48] <Cork> <div data-service="21" class="wrapper_servp">
[04:40:58] <Cork> that is what it will be looking for
[04:41:07] <Cork> though selecting inputs vased on value attributes...
[04:41:12] <Cork> that is a BAD idea
[04:41:34] <dimi1947> first things first...
[04:41:42] <dimi1947> I am heading somehwere with this
[04:41:50] <dimi1947> give me a min to explain
[04:42:06] <Cork> the attribute won't update if the value in the input is changed
[04:42:19] <Cork> so it will always only give results from what was there when the page loaded
[04:42:31] <Cork> and in that case you could just as well just select based on a class or something
[04:42:41] <Cork> THAT is why it is a BAD idea
[04:42:57] <Cork> it gives the reader a feeling it does something it doesn't
[04:44:13] <dimi1947> Cork:I lost you a little....
[04:44:34] <Cork> if you load <input value="20"> and the user changes the input to 50
[04:44:48] <Cork> $('[inputvalue*="20"]') will still match
[04:44:55] <Cork> cause it selects ATTRIBUTE not state
[04:45:49] <dimi1947> first of all to which input are you referring to...price or service?
[04:46:47] <dimi1947> the left or right....
[04:47:12] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/r2jawhg7/1/
[04:47:26] <Cork> it is the falsehood of the selector
[04:47:32] <Cork> what element it is about doesn't matter
[04:49:13] <dimi1947> sorry I am totally confused
[04:49:28] <Cork> [value=""] selects on the attribute of the input
[04:49:34] <Cork> not what value the input field has
[04:49:42] <Cork> those are two different things
[04:49:53] <dimi1947> yes I nunderstand this...
[04:52:19] <dimi1947> there is a point I want to make for the code in line 229....it does not target anything
[04:53:54] <dimi1947> I am totally confused...I cannot understand why I placed it there
[04:55:22] <dimi1947> I will be back in a couple of minutes
[05:04:41] <OnceMe> I have two boxes, and if right box expands dynamically when I type text and such, can I somehow affect box1 to be in the same height?
[05:05:05] <Cork> OnceMe: check flexbox
[05:06:44] <OnceMe> uhm thats not it
[05:06:56] <OnceMe> I have separate componenets with box1 and box2 and the same min-height set
[05:07:02] <OnceMe> if box2 expands, it will be bigger
[05:07:10] <OnceMe> however box1 will be the same, since no text is added
[05:07:22] <Cork> by binding them with a flexbox
[05:07:26] <OnceMe> so I want to match with jquery the height of box2 which is set to height: auto when text is dynamically added, to box1
[05:07:40] <Cork> any other solution will result in glitches if the page gets resized
[05:08:12] <OnceMe> how to do it with flexbox?
[05:08:17] <OnceMe> I use bootstrap and its already responsive
[05:08:43] <dimi1947> Cork:now things are more clear
[05:08:51] <Cork> responsive sure, but not adapting other elements based on overflow
[05:09:33] <OnceMe> if I add display: flex; to box1
[05:09:39] <OnceMe> my eleemts are displayed in line
[05:09:41] <OnceMe> which I dont want
[05:09:44] <Cork> ...
[05:09:50] <Cork> that isn't how flexbox works
[05:10:05] <Cork> i didn't mean just slap a different display on it and everything will be fine
[05:10:17] <Cork> you will have to restructure the page to make this work reliably
[05:10:57] <OnceMe> and how to achieve that>
[05:11:28] <Cork> without ever seen what you're trying to do i can't give you a specific answer
[05:11:38] <Cork> make a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do
[05:13:33] <OnceMe> hmm
[05:13:38] <OnceMe> is there any other way to do this with jquery?
[05:14:43] <Cork> ya, but it won't accomodate for page changes resulting in the text changing the number of lines it creates
[05:15:10] <Cork> you can set the height of box2 to the height of box1 when you get the input event changing the text of box1
[05:15:27] <Cork> but again it WILL break as soon as the page is resized
[05:20:38] <OnceMe> I want to try it
[05:20:43] <OnceMe> how do I get that dynamic height with jquery?
[05:21:10] <Cork> $('#box2').height($('#box1').height());
[05:22:01] <OnceMe> box2 is expanded
[05:22:05] <OnceMe> and box1 is not
[05:22:11] <OnceMe> so box2 is expanded dynamically
[05:22:33] <Cork> so when the expantion changes you will have to update
[05:22:47] <Cork> and check the state and leave it when it is in the different states
[05:24:49] <serdar__> moin
[05:25:49] <serdar__> I have a strange behaviour. I wrote a script, which uses autocomplete and add ui-autocomplete-input ant autocomplete="off" to the tag.
[05:44:38] <OnceMe> Cork, yeah you were right
[05:44:43] <OnceMe> on resize, its not working
[05:44:53] <OnceMe> whats the best way to port this to flex as soon as possible?
[05:45:16] <Cork> as i have no clue what you're working on; can't say
[05:48:34] <irondew> http://jsfiddle.net/nrd6m7wu/2/ Is there any way to move this crab also up and down in same time?
[05:50:07] <Cork> irondew: you just want to have the image move around? or do you want it to interact with the user?
[05:50:23] <Cork> cause if "just animate" just use css for it instead
[05:51:38] <AdamPDotty> also cross-posting
[05:52:36] * Cork drops
[05:57:14] <serdar__> But this script is used on another part of the site with the same tag ids, but it does not work there
[05:58:08] <Cork> serdar__: is the script ran before those elements exist?
[05:58:30] <serdar__> Cork, yes
[05:58:36] <Cork> there you go
[05:58:46] <Cork> you can't find code to elements that doesn't exist
[05:59:04] <serdar__> But it is included?!
[05:59:13] <serdar__> I mean I can see it in the source view
[05:59:28] <Cork> ok?
[05:59:38] <Cork> doesn't help the selector finding something that isn't there
[06:00:05] <irondew> Cork: wanna just animate it, i tried css and couldnt make it, would you help me please?
[06:00:07] <Cork> when $('#the-id') runs it has to find the element for .autocomplete() to do anything
[06:00:07] <serdar__> I mean I have two forms with same ids on different pages and one script
[06:00:16] <serdar__> hmm
[06:00:29] <serdar__> Can I say query to refund it?
[06:00:32] <serdar__> refind
[06:00:35] <Cork> no
[06:00:44] <Cork> it isn't a listener it is a selector
[06:00:55] <Cork> the code runs when you call it
[06:01:34] <Cork> you can verify if the selector works by doing something like console.log('selector found:', $('#the-selector').length)
[06:01:46] <Cork> and add it right before the $().autocomplete() line in the code
[06:02:06] <Cork> if it gives you 0 you have a selector running before the element it looks for
[06:04:24] <serdar__> hm
[06:16:03] <serdar__> What are my options in that caseﬂ
[06:16:08] <serdar__> ?
[06:27:58] <serdar__> Could I solve this by using class instead of id?
[06:50:24] <serdar__> this is odd
[06:51:19] <serdar__> $("#myid").val() contains the entry I made in my input, but the $(".myclass").val() is empty
[06:53:39] <serdar__> darn
[06:56:03] <OnceMe> Cork, im working with bootstrap
[06:56:11] <OnceMe> and have used standard grid componenets
[07:02:01] <SomeT> how would I do the following in javascript / jquery?: if an html element / button / image is clicked and function is called then display variable such and such from three options /  different variables
[07:06:40] <OnceMe> this is my structure https://jsfiddle.net/jze8gqb1/1415/ so how would I make this impact both boxes? since when I add text dynamically with jquery or in this example, one box is bigger than the other, so how to fix this?
[07:07:42] <serdar__> hmmm
[07:08:00] <serdar__> using class did not solve my problem
[07:08:04] <OnceMe> Cork ^
[07:39:22] <OnceMe> any help pls?
[08:17:38] <serdar__> Is this allowed $(".myclass #myid")?
[08:17:49] <thykka> yes, but why?
[08:18:26] <thykka> IDs are supposed to be unique, so unless you're trying to check whether that element is contained by a certain class of element, it's pointless
[08:19:41] <serdar__> Should they be unique by page or in total? I have 2 pages one for registration and one for adding address. In both cases I have fields with id streetName (for example)
[08:20:03] <serdar__> But if I use my script, then it only works for one page, but not for the other one
[08:20:13] <serdar__> Now I am looking for a solution
[08:21:05] <thykka> if they're on completely separate pages, that should be fine
[08:21:33] <thykka> ...fine in terms of HTML validity
[08:21:50] <thykka> but possibly confusing
[08:22:49] <serdar__> my problem is, that the id selector is not able to find the element
[08:23:23] <thykka> have you mistyped it? is your JS executing before the DOM is ready (or the element is attached)?
[08:23:44] <serdar__> The last one I guess
[08:24:32] <thykka> yeah, if your script is in <head> and it's not wrapped within an onload or DOMContentLoaded event, it's going to run before the elements are accessible
[08:26:06] <serdar__> Is this unload? $(function () {});
[08:26:16] <serdar__> onload
[08:27:00] <serdar__> Or this: $(document).ready(function () {}) I use both, but my code is in the first one
[08:27:05] <thykka> yes, http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:27:34] <thykka> is the form included within the html document? or are you inserting it dynamically?
[08:28:12] <serdar__> It is a tag file, which is loaded into a tsp, so yes to the last one
[08:28:43] <serdar__> And if I understand you correct, then I am doing twice the same thing
[08:28:46] <thykka> right, then you should delay your JS until it has been inserted..
[08:28:49] <serdar__> S/tsp/jsp
[08:28:58] <thykka> and by delay, I don't mean .delay() :P
[08:29:57] <thykka> find out whether the system you're using has an event or some other type of hook you can attach to, once the elements have been inserted into the DOM
[08:30:26] <serdar__> okay different idea: what if I add something like this in my class js-page-1 and do something like this: $(".js-page-1").ready(..)
[08:30:44] <thykka> still won't work, unless the element is in the DOM at that point
[08:31:07] <thykka> from what you've said, the selector is not the problem
[08:31:19] <thykka> so modifying the selector will have no effect
[08:32:03] <thykka> "a tag file, loaded into a jsp" <-- what library/framework is this?
[08:32:07] <serdar__> But then it should also not work for the first page, right?
[08:32:11] <serdar__> spring
[08:33:49] <serdar__> I never tried this, but what about jquery templates? Would it be useful
[08:34:04] <thykka> wow.. Spring's website has a modal on every page. The modal doesn't load for me, so I need to manually remove the elements from the DOM... great job...
[08:34:23] <thykka> I don't know, but I don't think that's parallel to this problem at all
[08:35:39] <thykka> what initializes Spring? Have you looked whether there are some hooks related to that?
[08:36:05] <serdar__> If I go to page1, then go to page2, is the selector looking for the first object found?
[08:36:42] <thykka> depends on the selector and the way you're selecting
[08:36:51] <thykka> with jQuery, a collection is returned
[08:37:05] <thykka> so if there are many elements that match the selector, you get them all
[08:37:45] <thykka> not sure what you meant with going to page1/2
[08:37:52] <serdar__> but they are on different pages, I thought with every page a new Dom is created?!
[08:38:06] <thykka> right
[08:38:12] <thykka> well
[08:38:28] <thykka> right, unless your framework is doing some weird SPA stuff
[08:46:51] <serdar__> hmm
[08:56:20] <hollusion> $('table tr td:first') selects only 1 element
[08:56:34] <hollusion> how do i select first td of each tr?
[08:57:31] <thykka> $('table tr td:first-child') ?
[08:57:48] <Cork> ya, :first is the same as .first()
[08:58:04] <Cork> the css format is :first-child or :nth-child()
[08:58:07] <thykka> or.. $('table tr td').filter(':first')
[08:58:17] <Cork> no
[08:58:29] <Cork> .first() always only gives you one record
[08:58:50] <hollusion> table tr td:first-child
[08:58:51] <hollusion> seems to be it
[08:59:01] <hollusion> thank you guys
[09:14:02] <serdar__> Okay what about this: var obj1 = null; $(".uniqueClassPage").ready( function() {obj1 = $(".myclass");}); obj1.autocomplete(...)
[09:14:14] <OnceMe> serdar__, hi
[09:14:21] <OnceMe> can you help me maybe
[09:14:55] <serdar__> Don't know, did you ask something?
[09:16:55] <hollusion> does a table always have tbody on the dom level?
[09:17:02] <Cork> no
[09:17:35] <Cork> well it does, but it is as anonymous elements so you don't see them
[09:18:14] <OnceMe> Cork, ccheck to this page https://jsfiddle.net/jze8gqb1/1423/ so both boxes are equals?
[09:18:21] <OnceMe> you said to use flex, I tried but not working
[09:18:26] <OnceMe> you said to make a fiddle, so here it is :D
[09:18:35] <OnceMe> I was trying to add flex for 5 hours str8 no luck :(
[09:21:02] <Cork> i don't have time to clean that up right now
[09:21:57] <OnceMe> :(
[09:22:03] <OnceMe> Cork, can you real quick check it?
[09:22:56] <Cork> OnceMe: have a look at http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/
[09:23:06] <Cork> it might help you understand how flexbox works
[09:23:41] <OnceMe> I did
[09:23:42] <OnceMe> no heko
[09:23:44] <OnceMe> no luck
[09:59:40] <delboy1978uk> hola amigos o/
[09:59:58] <delboy1978uk> i have jquery. i have a select with a bunch of options. i have a jquery object representing selected option. i need to check IF the object is the first or last child of the select. can anyone help?
[10:16:08] <shoky_> delboy1978uk: plenty of ways to do it. e.g.   .is(':first-child')   .is(':last-child')
[10:16:39] <shoky_> or using .index()
[10:22:29] <delboy1978uk> shoky_: ah, as simple as that? great, thank you so much
[10:22:29] <delboy1978uk> !
[10:47:45] <serdar__> thykka, I guess I found out the problem. There is an Ajax call which adds these elements after
[10:48:57] <serdar__> So it makes sense, that the selector cannot find the element
[11:53:44] <serdar__> After an Ajax call, my code is doing this: $("#i18nAddressForm").html($(data).html()); which add html code to page, but not to dom
[11:54:29] <serdar__> Can I use 	$("#i18nAddressForm").append($(data).html()) instead?
[11:56:04] <serdar__> Not working :(
[11:57:30] <thykka> serdar__, as I've said a few times before, you'll need to attach to the ajax function's callback. No amount of playing with selectors will help, if you're not calling itat the right time
[12:08:41] <serdar__> thykka, I am in the success call, I guess you mean that
[12:08:51] <Buoy172> Hey
[12:09:03] <Buoy172> when I add a svg with jquery it doesn't show
[12:09:06] <Buoy172> wtf?
[12:09:27] <Buoy172> when I add the <svg> in the html, it shows in the browser
[12:11:13] <pavonia> How are you adding the svg?
[12:12:51] <Buoy176> $('<svg />', { id, class: 'whatever', xmlns: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' }).appendTo($parent);
[12:12:53] <Buoy176> like this
[12:13:05] <Buoy176> but I'm reading I should use js instead?
[12:14:47] <Buoy176> Should I use createElementNS
[12:15:20] <pavonia> What is $parent?
[12:18:43] <Buoy176> pavonia: an existing div, validly selected with $(id)
[12:18:56] <Buoy176> like this: const $parent = $('#the-parent-id');
[12:19:56] <Buoy176> anyway I figured it out
[12:20:05] <Buoy176> this works: $(document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'svg')).appendTo($parent);
[12:21:22] <serdar__> thykka, $.getScript in success did the trick!
[12:22:57] <pavonia> Buoy176:  "id, class: 'whatever'" looks wrong to me, is this even legal syntax?
[12:25:17] <Buoy176> it is
[12:25:37] <Buoy176> id is a previously definded variable, like: const id = "my-svg";
[12:26:27] <pavonia> Oh
[16:13:27] <z1haze> I have an html data-attr `data-dialogify='{"width":"500","height":"auto","dialogClass":"checkout-view-logo"}'` and a module that just fetches $el.data('dialogify') .. why would i get unexpected o in JSON.parse .. isnt that how jquery handles datta attrib it will automatically parse it?
[16:23:18] <pavonia> z1haze: Do you call JSON-parse yourself?
[16:23:32] <z1haze> i did not
[16:23:40] <z1haze> thats why i am a bit surprised
[16:24:25] <z1haze> was* surprised. i figured it out, the webpack build had a problem or was finished building. something along those lines
[17:08:37] <setuid> Any humans about? I'm trying to figure out why an alert() isn't firing. The var I'm searching for has the exact string I'm testing, and console.log confirms it, but it's not working: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/ac9e6036/
[17:08:37] <WALL-E> setuid: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[17:09:00] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:09:42] <robertmaxrees> setuid have you confirmed both of those vars?
[17:09:55] <setuid> robertmaxrees: Yes, I can print them both in console, but they're falling through the test
[17:10:05] <setuid> One sec, I'll pastebin the whole script, it's small
[17:10:14] <robertmaxrees> could you fiddle it instead?
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> so I can see markup?
[17:10:35] <setuid> hrm, not sure I can get the html into fiddle, give me a sec, I'll try
[17:12:01] <setuid> Nope, can't get at the html, it's dynamic via ajax/websockets
[17:12:06] <setuid> Lemme see if the debugger will expose it
[17:12:30] <robertmaxrees> your dev tools can.
[17:12:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:12:46] <robertmaxrees> also: I'm not seeing where alert_sent is definedf.
[17:12:48] <robertmaxrees> *defined
[17:13:28] <setuid> Does this work? https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/365409/
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/28Lrpfbe/
[17:14:11] <robertmaxrees> so basically this?
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> when/how do you fire monitor_page?
[17:14:23] <setuid> hrm, wait... so my html isn't showing up
[17:15:11] <setuid> The script fires after all page elements load, and then again every 5 seconds
[17:15:17] <setuid> it monitors the page for in-page changes
[17:15:25] <setuid> So far, that works... console.log shows the status as expected
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> so the fiddle works, but your page doesn't?
[17:16:52] <setuid> fiddle doesn't work, though it renders the elements as expected
[17:17:06] <robertmaxrees> so what is the fiddle doing wrong?
[17:17:26] <setuid> https://www.dropbox.com/s/ret99k92wzt0fwm/Screenshot_2018-07-05_17-15-44.png?dl=0
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> not helpful heh
[17:17:37] <setuid> That's what I see in console, so I know the vars and strings are being matched and correct
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[17:18:12] <setuid> When alert_sent > 0, it should fire the alert; that works when I move it up out of the monitor_page loop
[17:18:47] <setuid> Actually, if I remove the second part of the compound if() test, it works also, but stacks up multiple alets
[17:19:04] <setuid> I'm trying to make it so that it checks if it's already fired an alert, and doesn't send additional alerts
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> right now it's saying "if agent_status isn't idle and alert_sent is greater than 1
[17:19:46] <robertmaxrees> err, greater than 0
[17:20:18] <robertmaxrees> do you mean if (agent_status != 'idle' && alert_sent === 0) { ?
[17:20:19] <setuid> Correct. So if the agent_status changes to anything other than 'idle' _and_ alert_sent > 0, send an alert
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:20:33] <setuid> hrm, lemme stare at my logic again
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> right now there's no place your code can increment alert_sent
[17:20:39] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> alert_sent is always 0.
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> so it'll never pass that condition.,
[17:21:21] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[17:22:30] <setuid> Yeah, bad logic on my end, I had some other if() tests in there, so now that works. Sort-of... if I dismiss the alert, the loop continues (expected), but it doesn't fire additional alerts when the user doesn't log back in (thus changing agent_status back to 'idle'). I'll have to see if I can reset the alert_sent to '0' when the dialog is dismissed.
[17:24:01] <setuid> Got it, that was too easy. changed alert_sent++ to alert_sent=0;
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:24:17] <robertmaxrees> when do you increment it now tho?
[17:24:58] <setuid> I don't need to, because of the secondary check
[17:26:04] <setuid> I should rethink this, something feels wrong about this logic
[17:26:20] <setuid> I need a way to hook into the dialog that is displayed
[17:27:23] <robertmaxrees> is it an alert or a dialog?
[17:28:33] <setuid> It's an alert, but I could make it a dialog. Just need a popup to notify the user that they were logged out, and they should log back in again.
[17:28:34] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like - you don't really need to do anything special.  just increment after the alert's been diszplayed.
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[17:30:36] <setuid> That doesn't work either
[17:30:45] <setuid> if I increment it, the check for '==0' will pass through
[17:32:26] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're doing?
[17:33:53] <setuid> https://jsfiddle.net/tj8rn4wy/
[17:34:19] <setuid> Ideally, when an alert is fired, alert_sent gets incremented to 1, and when the user dismisses it, it's reset to 0 and the counter starts over again
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[17:34:47] <robertmaxrees> so backing waaaaaaaay up
[17:34:55] <robertmaxrees> fire the alert, increment to 1.
[17:34:57] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:35:14] <setuid> yes, and setting it to 1, avoids stacking alerts
[17:35:34] <setuid> so then I check, and don't fire an alert again if one is already on-screen, but not dismissed
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> so really, you want to stop displaying alerts.
[17:35:43] <robertmaxrees> if one is already displayed
[17:35:46] <setuid> Correct
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> so really, you want to stop the interval.
[17:36:21] <setuid> Would wait() inside the alert loop work?
[17:37:00] <robertmaxrees> there's no general wait()
[17:37:14] <setuid> er, clear.interval?
[17:37:28] <robertmaxrees> it's just clearInterval(intervalName)
[17:38:30] <setuid> But now to use it inside my monitor_page() function, I need to make timer_interval a global, which breaks the logic of the timer
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:39:40] <setuid> Because it's inside a function that guarantees all page elements have been loaded before firing the function
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not true.
[17:39:51] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[17:39:53] <setuid> that's a requirement, because of the way jquery/userscripts work
[17:40:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:40:04] <setuid> btdt, spent an hour debugging that mess
[17:40:16] <setuid> userscripts fire on page load, not on page completion
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> that might be a thing for userscripts, but that's not true with "jquery"
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> unless you use document ready or window load, jquery doesn't fundeamentally change when your code fires.
[17:41:08] <robertmaxrees> *fundamentally
[17:41:17] <setuid> When I started writing this, agent_status was always 'null', because it fired the function before the page elements that checked the agent status
[17:41:44] <robertmaxrees> putting code into a function alone does not fix that problem (shrug)
[17:41:51] <setuid> So I had to add a timer there to give the page time to load, before running the function
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[17:42:00] <robertmaxrees> you want document ready then.
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why you have that timer.
[17:42:53] <setuid> So something like the top example here? https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:43:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:43:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery.
[17:43:40] <setuid> I was, but the browser complained that it was deprecated, even when I used jquery-migrate as suggested
[17:43:51] <setuid> "QMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated"
[17:43:51] <robertmaxrees> that what was deprecated?
[17:44:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:44:08] <robertmaxrees> were you using jQuery.browser in your code?
[17:44:11] <setuid> er, JQMIGRATE
[17:44:23] <setuid> Nope, but the remote server's ajax/code may have been
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> what version of jQuery are you using?
[17:44:55] <robertmaxrees> the browser doesn't care about what version of jQuery you're using, so it's not going to throw warnings like that.
[17:45:23] <setuid> Ok, hold... trying jquey now, via @require http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[17:45:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> don't use that.
[17:45:57] <setuid> blergh, ok... where should I source jquery?
[17:46:04] <robertmaxrees> https://blog.jquery.com/2014/07/03/dont-use-jquery-latest-js/
[17:46:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/
[17:46:37] <setuid> Ok, https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.js
[17:46:54] <robertmaxrees> only use slim if you understand what that means.
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> specifically, it drops ajax and effects.
[17:47:17] <setuid> I only need a very small subset of its capabilities
[17:47:31] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[17:47:34] <setuid> Fair enough, I'll use https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js
[17:47:58] <robertmaxrees> because depending on what all you're doing, you may not need jquery at all.  it's a handy tool, but not required :)
[17:48:31] <setuid> Well, if I can get rid of the timer, and that means using $( document ).ready(function(), then I probably need jquery, no?
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> what kind of browser support are you planning?
[17:49:04] <setuid> Chrome/Firefox/Safari, whatever modern browsers are used by the team
[17:49:25] <setuid> This is just a quick-and-dirty hack to stop our pbx system from blowing out users without their knowledge
[17:49:29] <robertmaxrees> because there's a native way to handle document ready.
[17:49:42] <robertmaxrees> just as an FYI.,
[17:50:02] <setuid> Lead the way
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/30319853/923919
[17:56:12] <setuid> That doesn't work with the recursive logic that monitors the page for changes
[17:56:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:29] <robertmaxrees> this is just handling your pageload concerns.
[17:56:49] <setuid> Right, but that's precisesly where the timer is injected
[17:57:01] <setuid> One sec, I'll model it with the example links above
[17:57:11] <robertmaxrees> it feels like you're conflating things heh
[17:58:25] <setuid> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/302c2f64/
[17:58:35] <setuid> That's a modified version, without the page load timer
[17:59:01] <setuid> that should fire the monitor_page function every 5 seconds, _after_ the entire initial page is loaded
[17:59:20] <setuid> but it doesn't, the timer never starts and monitor_page() never gets executed
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> does the userscript have special rules or w/e on when it fires?
[18:01:09] <setuid> Nope
[18:01:13] <robertmaxrees> because the code needs to fire before the event has fired.
[18:01:17] <setuid> I did have: @run-at       document-idle
[18:01:24] <setuid> but that had no effect, so I removed it
[18:02:44] <robertmaxrees> http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#ready
[18:02:48] <robertmaxrees> for an  alternative.
[18:02:58] <robertmaxrees> that SO link earlier explained why you need a bit more than just DOMContentLoaded
[18:07:17] <setuid> Ok, this has the effect I was looking for: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/ee91032b/
[18:07:35] <setuid> Slightly modified, but if the agent status goes from 'released' (logged out) to 'idle' (logged back in), I reset alert_sent
[18:08:10] <setuid> I could just let it keep incrementing, but I'd rather not find some undocumented maximum integer length and blow up my script
[18:09:00] <setuid> This was just a poc, now I need to figure out how to get this to either flash the browser tab, bring it to the front, email/sms the user or send a desktop alert via zenity or notify-send.
[18:17:16] <setuid> I thought an alert.() would bring focus to that tab, or at least flash the tab in some way; it doesn't.
[18:19:15] <robertmaxrees> you could always change the favicon like gmail
[18:19:43] <robertmaxrees> or https://curtistimson.co.uk/post/js/create-a-flashing-tab-notification-page-title/
[18:21:40] <setuid> Stealing that ;)
[18:46:44] <setuid> robertmaxrees: Here's the final code, which works perfectly: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/87514f54/
[18:46:53] <setuid> I could probably optimize some a bit, but that works good enough for now :)
[18:48:30] <robertmaxrees> glad you got it working
[18:49:05] <setuid> A few warnings in tampermonkey, but it does work
[18:49:22] <robertmaxrees> what are the warnings?
[18:49:24] <setuid> it claims the pageTitleNotification is undefined, because it comes before the monitor_page function, but it works
[18:49:37] <setuid> Also one about 'unexpected use of comma operator'
[18:50:03] <setuid> off: function() { t.clearInterval(e.interval), e.interval = null, n.title = e.currentTitle
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw var timer_variable = setInterval(function() { monitor_page(); }, 2000);
[18:50:15] <robertmaxrees> var timer_variable = setInterval(monitor_page, 2000);
[18:50:19] <robertmaxrees> can be this instead.
[18:50:55] <setuid> ah, good tweak
[18:53:56] <setuid> robertmaxrees: Is it possible to have the userscript call a local process, beep, etc.?
[18:54:21] <setuid> Flashing the tab is useful, but might not be 'enough' to get an agent to immediately attend to the issue
[18:57:14] <robertmaxrees> i have 0 familiarity with userscripts.
[18:57:30] <setuid> Yeah, this is my second one ;)
[18:57:44] <setuid> I wrote one about a year ago, to re-skin Salesforce to make it more usable
[18:58:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess it's not doabnle.
[18:58:04] <robertmaxrees> *doable
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> but I could be wrong.
[18:58:34] <setuid> It worked, was able to add some styling and color to the sections, hyperlink across a subset of keywords and ohter things, worked pretty well
[18:58:53] <setuid> This one is hopefully going to keep our agents aware of when they get bounced out of the pbx, so they can log back in again
[18:59:22] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[19:10:27] <setuid> Thanks for the help with this, I would have bounced all over the place trying bad things ;)
[19:30:13] <robertmaxrees> S'what we're here for
[19:34:55] <setuid> robertmaxrees: Question: is it possible to have that script, which runs in the context of the page's namespace, send off an alert to a remote service, like say, send an sms?
[19:35:51] <robertmaxrees> anything that has an XHR endpoint exposed.
[19:36:33] <robertmaxrees> like, you can't just send SMS using in-page js lol
[19:37:56] <setuid> Sure, but something like Twilio's API should work, right?
[19:38:32] <robertmaxrees> so long as it'll accept cross-domain, in-browser
[19:38:45] <setuid> Or... drop a file in the browser cache, and let iWatch monitor for that file, and run a system process?
[19:38:49] <robertmaxrees> just because the API exists doesn't necessarily mean it'll work.
[19:38:50] * setuid hrmms
[19:38:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:38:58] <robertmaxrees> now you're mkaing it way too fragile.
[19:39:01] <robertmaxrees> *making
[19:39:19] <setuid> I need something more real-time than just a blinking browser tab + alert in the tab
[19:39:25] <setuid> That's not urgent enough
[19:39:52] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:40:08] <robertmaxrees> i mean, all of this sounds like complaints I'd bring up with your vendor.
[19:40:12] <robertmaxrees> buuuut (shrug)
[19:40:35] <setuid> Yes, that's one angle I'm going to look into, but until then... gluing this together to close this gap
[19:40:46] <robertmaxrees> then leave it rough.
[19:40:52] <robertmaxrees> you can't solve every issue.
[19:42:28] <setuid> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36620802/sending-sms-via-twilio-api
[19:42:30] <setuid> :)
[19:43:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't trust your call center to actually check to make sure they're logged in, but you're going to trust them with your twilio account secrets?
[19:43:28] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/36621936/923919
[19:43:48] <robertmaxrees> when twilio says "HEY DON'T DO THAT", i'd listen.
[19:46:16] <setuid> It wouldn't be configured on the server side, it would be per-agent twilio creds, which makes it untenable for most of the agents
[19:46:41] <setuid> The main issue, is that agents don't always notice their browser tab has been logged out, unless they open that tab and see they've been logged out
[19:46:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:47:35] <setuid> Buuuut... I could send an event with iMacros to the browser to push the "Log me in" button every time it logs the agent out, but that would be abused too, so I tried to leave a human element involved, to interactively click the alert dialog.
[19:48:11] <pavonia> What is the issue, getting informed by SMS when you haven't logged out from a website?
[19:48:30] <robertmaxrees> setuid i mean - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification
[19:48:30] <Robdgreat> or when you have
[19:48:45] <Robdgreat> I was going to ask if that had been explored
[19:48:51] <robertmaxrees> if you want a browser notification, there you go.
[19:53:47] <setuid> Is that supported in all current browsers?
[19:54:13] <setuid> wait, just saw the table at the bottom
[19:54:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
