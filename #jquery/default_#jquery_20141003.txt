[01:06:15] <ghostlines> hi, I have a jquery object and when I do $(object_name > '.classname') it returns true instead of the html like it normally does
[01:07:22] <ghostlines> how can I get it to return html like when I would do $('.classname > .classname') ?
[01:15:15] <Cork> ghostlines: (object_name > '.classname') makes no sense
[01:15:27] <Cork> ghostlines: is object_name a string, a jquery object, or what?
[01:15:34] <ghostlines> a jquery object
[01:15:40] <ghostlines> indeed I normally do this with strings
[01:15:49] <Cork> and you want to find direct children of that object?
[01:16:06] <Cork> object_name.children('.classname')
[01:16:07] <K4T> hello
[01:16:23] <Cork> ghostlines: if you need to look deeper use .find
[01:16:23] <ghostlines> Cork ahh, thanks I'll try that out
[01:16:25] <K4T> can someone recommend good, modern plugin like http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/ but with fixed width items?
[01:18:28] <ghostlines> Cork dude thanks alot I got through!
[01:49:33] <mooncup> is there a way to hide something in such a way that is doesn't get submitted as part of a form?
[01:49:38] <mooncup> without moving it
[01:51:31] <xec> .hilde() doesn't do the trick?
[01:52:12] <xec> iirc form elements with display: none; aren't submitted by default
[01:52:30] <xec> .hide() *
[01:55:56] <Cork> mooncup: set disabled on the field
[01:56:17] <Cork> mooncup: visually hiding elements doesn't affect forms
[01:56:32] <Cork> xec: not true :)
[01:56:46] <Cork> so .prop('disabled', true)
[03:55:50] <litropy> The more an image is resized using CSS (as in from its native dimension to a smaller dimension; the smaller dimension is what I'm talking about) the more load to the CPU/GPU when animating via requestAnimationFrame, correct?
[03:56:42] <Cork> litropy: doens't sound correct no
[03:58:36] <Cork> litropy: downscaling an image(or upscaling) causes the browser to do interpolate the image to improve the scaling result
[03:59:07] <Cork> litropy: but the fewer pixels it needs to run the interpolation on the faster that should go
[03:59:17] <Jattenalle> it is correct, browsers do NOT cache the resulting downscaled image, since it's considered dynamic they retain the original size and downscale it each redraw
[03:59:37] <Jattenalle> so if you have an original picture of 1000x1000 downscale that to 100x100, and then to 10x10
[03:59:45] <Jattenalle> both downscale operations will start from 1000x1000
[04:00:04] <Jattenalle> ie it wont be one at 1000 -> 100 and another at 100 -> 10, it will be: 1000 -> 100, and 1000 -> 10
[04:00:10] <Erwat> Jattenalle: is that expensive? going from 1000 -> 10
[04:00:29] <Jattenalle> same with any other manipulation, such as changing position etc, the original image is used, since the browser has no forward prediction of what style you might apply
[04:00:52] <Jattenalle> it is "expensive", if you are trying to make a game, you will want to make cached re-sized versions
[04:01:01] <Jattenalle> if it's just some site, with one or two such images, it doesnt matter
[04:01:20] <litropy> Jattenalle, this is essentially an image gallery with a slider. Many images.
[04:01:25] <Erwat> thank you that was exactly what i wanted to know
[04:01:44] <Jattenalle> litropy, well it depends on how many images are on screen and redrawn
[04:02:02] <Cork> what i contradicted is that the smaller the image became the higher the cpu load would be
[04:02:16] <litropy> Jattenalle, at most two images at a time; sliding 5 to 15.
[04:02:49] <Jattenalle> Cork, CPU load is constant for resizing, all browsers do filtering now, so it doesnt matter what you rescale to
[04:03:02] <Cork> Jattenalle: that was kinda my point
[04:03:14] <Jattenalle> litropy, you "might" have a problem on lower end handheld devices and such.. but i doubt it'll be much of an issue for that few images
[04:03:15] <litropy> Cork, your number of pixels comment helped. Essentially, I should serve only what's needed to improve PU performance.
[04:03:18] <Jattenalle> Cork, ah
[04:03:30] <Cork> litropy: a simple way to reduce the cost is to use transform instead of width/height of the image
[04:03:36] <Cork> as then you keep the image unscaled
[04:03:47] <Cork> and the scaling should (if available) all happen in the gpu
[04:03:47] <litropy> Jattenalle, it's definitely a jumpy animation.
[04:04:08] <litropy> Cork, CSS transform?
[04:04:12] <Cork> yes
[04:04:22] <Cork> transform: scale();
[04:04:28] <Jattenalle> you cant count on GPU kicking on for transforms, it might, and it might not
[04:04:29] <litropy> Cork, is that solely percentage based?
[04:04:32] <Cork> and scaleY
[04:04:49] <Cork> litropy: i think yes
[04:04:52] <Cork> but i don't remember
[04:04:56] <Jattenalle> litropy, do you have a link to your site?
[04:05:19] <litropy> Jattenalle, you're gonna laugh at my code. I'll DM you.
[04:05:48] <Jattenalle> scale(w, h) takes percentage, in the form of a decimal, ie: if you want 50% you do scale(0.5)
[04:06:18] <Jattenalle> though im pretty sure most browsers would let you do scale(50%) as well
[04:07:42] <litropy> Jattenalle, I need exact pixel dimensions, unfortunately.
[04:08:16] <Jattenalle> litropy, percentageDimensions = wantedDimensions / originalDimensions
[04:08:35] <Jattenalle> 0.5 = 200 / 400
[04:09:04] <Jattenalle> swap out the "wantedDimensions" for the pixel dims, and you can easily get the %
[04:09:10] <Jattenalle> it might be off by a pixel or two
[04:09:21] <Jattenalle> but that shouldnt matter too much when you're doing dynamic resizing of the entire page
[04:10:14] <Cork> Jattenalle: looking at the spec it looks like it only takes decimal numbers
[04:10:15] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#number-value
[04:10:15] <litropy> Jattenalle, actually, you're right, I think ... I'm sliding according to the container's div width.
[04:10:33] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/#funcdef-scale
[04:10:58] <Jattenalle> Cork, yeah, using the decimal is the way to go definitely
[04:11:02] <litropy> Jattenalle, but the thing is, it might slide one pixel too far, and then I have the edge of the next photo coming into view.
[04:11:04] <Jattenalle> even if % might work
[04:11:32] <Jattenalle> litropy, as long as all your scaling/sizing is using the same formula, no
[04:11:35] <Legie> Anybody can help me with jcarousel? i have the simplest functions with 2 buttons (prev, next) and want to slide some <li>'s - the code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/7tgxofqp/1/ - when i add to option auto set to 1, it wotks. but i want to slide only by click on button
[04:11:39] <Jattenalle> because then the width of the view will be the same as the image
[04:11:40] <Legie> thank you
[04:11:51] <Jattenalle> even if it's "off by a few pixels" they will both be off by the same amount
[04:12:17] <litropy> Jattenalle, Cork, so, even using transform, I should still be serving images of about the same size as what I need, to cut down on PU performance, right?
[04:12:33] <Jattenalle> it's usually best yeah
[04:12:33] <Cork> litropy: always
[04:12:43] <Cork> and also to reduce memory use
[04:12:44] <Jattenalle> especially since you're not really manipulating the size after the fact
[04:13:20] <Jattenalle> also, i can tell you that even your large image example, is fine
[04:13:30] <Jattenalle> at most you have two images being redrawn
[04:15:00] <litropy> Jattenalle, so the amination is smooth for you? Do you have a higher-end phone?
[04:15:31] <Jattenalle> unable to test on phone
[04:15:45] <Jattenalle> but it's using less than 1% of a single core of my CPU in software mode
[04:15:56] <Jattenalle> so unless the phone is < 36MHz...
[04:16:09] <litropy> Jattenalle, I hear ya. BTW, I know that text is overflowing.
[04:18:11] <litropy> Jattenalle, please tap the logo, then tap thenight rainbow. See how everything comes up from the bottom? That animation is really killing my phone. I'm trying to figure out how to iprove it.
[04:18:16] <litropy> improve*
[04:18:30] <Jattenalle> uh i lost the link, re-send
[04:18:43] <litropy> And, as Cork and I discussed, I'm in too deep to switch to CSS animations.
[04:21:31] <Jattenalle> oh what's killing you there isnt the images themselves per-se
[04:21:47] <Jattenalle> it's the massive amounts of redraw calls as you rescale.. well.. everything
[04:21:54] <litropy> Jattenalle, it's just such a massive ... yep
[04:22:45] <Jattenalle> kill the rescale
[04:23:35] <litropy> Jattenalle, but everything must fit the viewport.
[04:23:52] <Erwat> can i see the example too?
[04:24:07] <litropy> Erwat, gimme a sec.
[04:24:44] <litropy> Jattenalle, I'm thinking maybe just kill the animation ... fade it in, instead.
[04:25:46] <litropy> Jattenalle, so that yes, the CPU is still overloaded, but at least it's not so glaringly evident because of a choppy animation.
[04:26:04] <Jattenalle> yeah kill the resize
[04:26:05] <Jattenalle> just fade
[04:26:08] <litropy> Jattenalle, but if I can keep that animation somehow, it would be really nice.
[04:27:00] <litropy> Jattenalle, when you say resize ... you mean, kill the animation of the div that comes up from the bottom, right? Because resize events happen before that.
[04:27:13] <Legie> hello, anybody can help me with jcarousel? i have the simplest functions with 2 buttons (prev, next) and want to slide some <li>'s - the code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/7tgxofqp/1/ - when i add to option auto set to 1, it wotks. but i want to slide only by click on button
[04:27:28] <Legie> anybody knows ?
[04:31:06] <decx> Legie "NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/dist/jquery.jcarousel.min.js"
[04:31:32] <Erwat> litropy: and it's problematic on mobile devices in terms of performance?
[04:32:07] <decx> works fine with cdnjs Legie http://jsfiddle.net/7tgxofqp/2/
[04:32:29] <litropy> Erwat, yep. There's a point where when you go from home to a gallery, the animation hangs ... badly. Like 1 second.
[04:32:37] <decx> link?
[04:33:01] <litropy> decx, you asking me?
[04:33:12] <Legie> decx oh, so the site with jcarousel is not working. Thanks
[04:33:26] <decx> i scrolled up and saw a discussion about animation performance but no link litropy
[04:33:37] <litropy> decx, gimme a sec
[04:33:49] <decx> oh so it's a secret link
[04:34:30] <decx> i cant endorse this as it doesnt help the lurkers
[04:34:32] <decx> ^^
[04:34:55] <litropy> Sorry about the loadtime, guys. I know I need to resize every one of the images.
[04:35:46] <decx> dont use position top left, that'll kill mobile
[04:35:52] <litropy> And I know my code is laughable.
[04:36:01] <decx> enable hardware acc with transform2d
[04:36:08] <litropy> decx, CSS?
[04:36:17] <decx> and move stuff with it
[04:36:22] <Erwat> i know that console.log costs negligible performance
[04:36:30] <Erwat> but considering how many there are, could that impact anything?
[04:36:31] <litropy> decx, If so, I'm in too deep.
[04:36:34] <decx> repaint for every step is also killing perf
[04:36:52] <decx> so you have a perfect perf killing storm
[04:36:56] <Erwat> i mean i have a huge amount of messages shown and it has: 2400 console messages are not shown.
[04:37:05] <decx> big images, no hardware acc, topleft positioning
[04:37:28] <decx> *and repaints galore
[04:37:34] <litropy> Erwat, yep. Poor debugging lol
[04:37:53] <Erwat> this is almost like getting an error in c++
[04:37:58] <litropy> hahahhaahhaa
[04:38:08] <litropy> omg I'm cracking up
[04:38:30] <litropy> Erwat, I just left it all there just in case my client asked me to do ... anything.
[04:38:45] <litropy> Erwat, no messages upon launch.
[04:39:02] <litropy> as in, when it becomes "done"
[04:40:36] <litropy> decx, transform2d is CSS, right?
[04:40:58] <litropy> decx, also, what's the toplet alternative? Percentages?
[04:41:16] <decx> the alternative is transform
[04:41:27] <decx> translate2d not transform2d
[04:41:28] <decx> ^^
[04:43:01] <litropy> decx, Hmm. _maybe_ I'm not in too deep for that. If anything, I'll build that in a separate dir after launch.
[04:43:59] <Erwat> you probably aren't
[04:44:13] <decx> it boils down to changing left: x, top: y to translate(x,y)
[04:44:15] <Erwat> since you just set style.top = and style.left = right?
[04:44:19] <Erwat> what decx said
[04:45:18] <decx> relevant perf http://jsperf.com/translate3d-vs-xy/104
[04:47:39] <litropy> Hmmm ... and it's true that I use .position() when I need it.
[04:48:37] <litropy> When I need to get coords, that is. I'm not varing .css('left') or anything.
[04:48:51] <litropy> Alright, thx guys I'll see what I can do.
[04:50:10] <decx> well transform doesnt hcange the position
[04:50:13] <Erwat> wait what? translate3d did better thant ranslate2d?
[04:50:40] <decx> if you want to to extensive animation it's best to have a separate coordinates object for all your elements
[04:50:49] <Cork> translate3d triggers the browser to expect the element to change later
[04:50:51] <decx> that way you dont have to rely on the dom to get the position
[04:50:56] <Cork> Erwat: its an old trick
[04:51:24] <Erwat> also i had no idea safari had such great js performance compared to chrome/firefox
[04:51:28] <Erwat> that truly is impressive
[04:51:29] <Cork> Erwat: http://davidwalsh.name/translate3d
[04:52:01] <Cork> Erwat: that's a joke right?
[04:52:13] <Cork> safari is the slowest of the three as far as i know
[04:52:21] <Erwat> Cork: well the test given earlier
[04:52:30] <Erwat> had safari ahead of chrome and firefox by a mile on the graph
[04:52:48] <decx> they did catch up
[04:52:59] <Cork> Erwat: those are test running on different machines
[04:53:05] <decx> dont know about a mile
[04:53:07] <Erwat> ah i see, that explains a whole lot
[04:53:09] <Erwat> nevermind then!
[04:53:10] <Cork> so you shouldn't count on them too much
[04:53:13] <decx> ^^
[04:53:26] <Erwat> well i heard that yesterday from somewhere that someone was complaining about chrome performance being weak
[04:53:28] <Cork> Erwat: http://arewefastyet.com/ this one is quite good
[04:53:34] <Erwat> i dismissed it as nonsense but then when i saw this i was surprised
[04:53:36] <Cork> and run the different engines on the same hardware
[04:53:40] <Erwat> thank you for clearing it up
[04:54:07] <Cork> (it runs on a mac mini last i looked)
[04:54:22] <Cork> ah!, its been updated to a mac pro
[04:54:44] <Cork> that is why trident isn't represented btw
[04:55:02] <Erwat> i don't know about tests but from my personal experience (and tests) (between chrome and firefox mainly, everything else loses by default) i noticed that chrome was so much better
[04:55:20] <Erwat> firefox was really jerky when actually running things
[04:55:48] <Cork> Erwat: you most likely is seeing the effect of there big none js related problems
[04:56:03] <Cork> Erwat: spidermonkey is faster then v8 in quite a few areas
[04:56:06] <Erwat> it was tests with threejs though
[04:56:11] <Cork> but firefox does a lot of things on its main thread
[04:56:17] <Cork> causing animations to be jerky
[04:56:22] <Erwat> and absolute performance meant absolutely nothing if it was a little jerky
[04:56:28] <Cork> they are working HARD at adressing that
[04:56:45] <Cork> after they've done that is when we can start looking as fair comparisons :)
[04:56:57] <Erwat> if it still has any users left
[04:56:58] <simpleuser> Hi there. How can I select an input (a checkbox) according to its label?
[04:57:41] <Cork> simpleuser: "acording to its label"?
[04:57:46] <Cork> what do you mean by that?
[04:59:01] <simpleuser> Cork: Like I have a checkbox <input type="checkbox" … /><label for="…">Label of the checkbox</label>
[04:59:22] <Cork> simpleuser: if you use label for, just use the id
[04:59:37] <simpleuser> I’d like to find the input, by searching for the label
[04:59:44] <simpleuser> No because the user cannot know the id
[05:00:05] <Cork> by searching for the label??
[05:00:10] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[05:00:15] <simpleuser> Cork: I’m making behat tests
[05:00:41] <Cork> simpleuser: so when the user hits the label you want to find the input or what?
[05:01:02] <simpleuser> I should be able to say in my behat tests : "When I select the "Manhattan" checkbox, then…" (for example)
[05:01:08] <phx> simpleuser, data- fields maybe?
[05:01:18] <phx> s/fields/attributes/
[05:01:24] <simpleuser> So you would add thet to the input?
[05:01:29] <Cork> no
[05:01:32] <Cork> no need for that
[05:01:37] <simpleuser> <input data-county="Manhattan" /> ?
[05:01:40] <Cork> ok lets say you've found the label
[05:01:50] <Cork> and the label is x
[05:01:54] <simpleuser> yep
[05:02:02] <Cork> do $('#' +x.for)
[05:02:21] <Cork> and you have the input
[05:02:30] <simpleuser> What is ('#')?
[05:02:38] <simpleuser> Oh
[05:02:42] <simpleuser> to have the id?
[05:02:51] <Cork> to find the input based on the id ya
[05:03:00] <simpleuser> Clever. Thanks. Gonna try that ;)
[05:03:26] <Cork> simpleuser: if x is jquery do x.prop('for') instead of .for
[05:03:53] <phx> when i wanted to do something on a click on a div, i just added a data-foobar to the div, and the event.target.dataset.foobar contained my data
[05:04:26] <Cork> phx: sure, but he wants to find the input element based on the label associated with the label
[05:04:36] <Cork> he already have the data he needs in the dom
[05:04:40] <Cork> no need to add it again
[05:06:08] <phx> oh right
[05:06:18] <decx> where's that .control polyfill when you need it
[05:06:41] <phx> Cork, i would also do that with a data field. something like data-foobar="id-of-the-desired-element", so that'd be a direct reference
[05:06:42] <decx> that a property that labels have in chrome which is a reference their input btw
[05:06:48] <Cork> heh es6 is having problems with polyfills btw :)
[05:07:43] <Cork> latest problem was that mootools has added Array.prototype.contains
[05:07:53] <Cork> but it isn't compatible with the es6 spec
[05:07:57] <Cork> so yay
[05:08:05] <decx> good old mootools adding to vanilla stuff
[05:08:10] <decx> *hate*
[05:08:15] <d0de> does anyone have an apple iOS device handy and a spare 30 seconds? I'm trying to work out if audio will play when the user taps a sound icon on my site; http://asoftmurmur.com/beta/
[05:08:22] <d0de> I don't have any apple products myself :(
[05:08:23] <Cork> the problem is actually what they added is enumerable
[05:08:32] <Cork> and then they copy it in a loop where they loop array
[05:08:41] <Cork> but the spec standard isn't enumerable
[05:08:47] <Cork> so it breaks it
[05:09:00] <Cork> (it was the cause of the jsfiddle problem i had a little while back)
[05:18:38] <litropy> Doesn't Chrome's emulator actually use the requested engine?
[05:19:00] <Cork> most likely no
[05:19:13] <Cork> not sure what emulator your talking about
[05:19:26] <litropy> Like, couldn't d0de load it up in Chrome's iPhone 5 emulator and get accurate results?
[05:19:35] <litropy> (Safari)
[05:19:51] <Cork> chromes iphone 5 emulator?
[05:19:54] <d0de> litropy, I had no idea such a thing existed
[05:20:28] <litropy> Cork, yah it's in chrome's dev tools
[05:20:45] <Cork> litropy: it will still use the blink rendering engine
[05:20:50] <Cork> and chromes v8 js engine
[05:20:55] <litropy> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode
[05:20:59] <Cork> so ya, i wouldn't trust it
[05:21:21] <Cork> the device at the top is for dimensions
[05:21:33] <Cork> not "emulate"
[05:23:09] <d0de> litropy, thanks but I don't think that's going to work. I'm trying to test against iOS restrictions on HTML5 audio activity, I think I need a real device or a fully-fledged emulator
[05:23:25] <Cork> litropy, d0de: the only emulator for iphone that actually do a faithful job at it
[05:23:39] <litropy> d0de, I agree.
[05:23:56] <Cork> is the xcode editor
[05:24:12] <d0de> I need to buy a mac, I guess
[05:24:16] <Cork> sadly you can only get it if you have a mac ya
[05:24:24] <litropy> d0de, although I'd be surprised if iOS Safari had restrictions for audio.
[05:24:26] <Cork> or a hackentorsh
[05:24:43] <Cork> litropy: ios has quite a few bugs
[05:24:58] <litropy> d0de, just buy a friend a dink every so often, and he'll take the sec to tell you if it works :D
[05:25:04] <litropy> drink*
[05:25:04] <Cork> it is the browser i trust the least to follow standards actually
[05:25:33] <jeffreylevesque> is there a way i can target a 'input' element that does not have a 'readonly' attribute?
[05:25:54] <decx> i dont think new Audio('file') and .play() can have that many bugs ^^
[05:25:58] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: :not([readonly]
[05:26:01] <Cork> opps
[05:26:03] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: :not([readonly])
[05:26:35] <Cork> decx: new Audio is quite new, and the spec has changed quite a few times
[05:26:41] <litropy> Cork, I do distrust that Apple would follow standards. But it seems like everyone is all about HTML5.
[05:26:43] <Cork> so ya, i wouldn't count on it
[05:26:51] <d0de> decx, is that the web audio API?
[05:26:57] <jeffreylevesque> i have `$('input'):not([readonly]);`
[05:27:08] <jeffreylevesque> console says 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : '
[05:27:12] <Cork> d0de: it is one of the new dom apis ya
[05:27:18] <d0de> `$('input:not([readonly]');`
[05:27:32] <Cork> nops
[05:27:39] <Cork> `$('input:not([readonly])');`
[05:27:40] <Cork> :)
[05:28:15] <d0de> yeah I should probably be using it, it's a lot more flexible than using <audio> on iOS
[05:28:38] <Cork> d0de: make sure it exists for the units you need to support though
[05:29:04] <d0de> with <audio> you can't adjust the volume, can't preload anything, can't play more than one stream at a time and need a direct user interaction to start any audio playing
[05:29:20] <Cork> also i know there is quite a few inconsistencies around <audio> and Audio
[05:29:49] <Cork> different browsers have different limitations :/
[05:29:53] <decx> shouldnt matter that much for what amounts to a soundboard
[05:29:59] <Cork> so make sure to test things carefully
[05:30:21] <Cork> decx: you mean like can only play once, play delay doesn't matter?
[05:30:31] <decx> right
[05:30:39] <Cork> there is quite a few quite nasty problems around audio
[05:30:50] <d0de> decx, it matters quite a bit if you want to play more than one thing at a time
[05:31:08] <litropy> decx, ugh so I can't use .position(), huh
[05:31:24] <Cork> litropy: .position() triggers reflow
[05:31:27] <Cork> every time you call it
[05:31:44] <decx> right you want a separate coordinates object
[05:32:09] <decx> on load you get the base positions, fill your coordinates object and then never touch the dom again to get coordinates only to set
[05:40:19] <QKO|Work> hi
[05:40:56] <QKO|Work> can I plug in custom selectors (that don't select DOM elements) into jquery?
[05:42:35] <Cork> QKO|Work: what would a selector that doesn't select do?
[05:42:38] <Legie> decx: this solved my problem, but when i added your link with jquery.jcarousel.min to my side, it broke other slider, can i load link from cdnsj only for one div?
[05:43:03] <Cork> QKO|Work: the hole point of jquerys finder it to select dom elements
[05:43:55] <decx> it's a new an improved jquery without sizzle
[05:44:21] <decx> Legie sounds like you do something fucky
[05:45:11] <Cork> QKO|Work: please elaborate, it isn't possible to answer your question without more info
[05:45:43] <decx> there is some weird shit on wikimedia
[05:45:47] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/juy5b1su/
[05:46:52] <Cork> lol
[05:47:09] <Legie> decx : i just added to <head> this <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.jcarousel.min">
[05:47:26] <Legie> its link what you added to my code and it works.
[05:47:54] <mooncup> ah just noticed your reply Cork
[05:48:00] <mooncup> disabling is ideal, thanks
[05:48:02] <mooncup> didn't think of that
[05:48:03] <Sunzero> hi, some body knows how i can get a ajax request (data) in a object? This not work : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/645e840030c26316ef20
[05:48:35] <decx> obejct?
[05:49:26] <decx> you need to call something that uses data on success, that's how it goes with async Sunzero
[05:51:32] <islalobo> Hello, we are using the plugin jquery.stellar.min.js to create a parallax scrolling effect. However, as a result we are getting an unwanted space under our header images.
[05:52:09] <Cork> Sunzero: not sure what your trying to do from that snippet
[05:52:33] <Cork> Sunzero: the variable is defined locally in the callback, so how would it be accessible from anywhere outside it?
[05:52:48] <QKO|Work> Cork: I want to have a common entry point for some stuff
[05:52:48] <Sunzero> decx: yes there is somthing https://gist.github.com/anonymous/18c9678d463aed772b4d  but console.log(arrangement[1]) show me {'Ma': true, 'Zo': true} and not  Object { Ma=true, Vr=true}
[05:53:00] <QKO|Work> for example, if I want to edit the dom I'd be doing a regular jquery select
[05:53:10] <Nindustries> Hi, can I do this in jQuery (mobile, where route is a function where I check the hash; $( window ).on( "navigate", $.proxy(this.route, this) );  ?
[05:53:19] <Cork> Sunzero: most likely cause the server isn't sending json
[05:53:22] <Cork> but text
[05:53:25] <QKO|Work> I'm in the process of writing some sort of data management system that caches and communicates with odata and signalR
[05:53:36] <Cork> it needs to send the correct content-type header (application/json)
[05:53:44] <QKO|Work> and I was wondering if I could use jquery as an entrypoint
[05:54:12] <Cork> QKO|Work: not really you could hook functions onto $
[05:54:25] <QKO|Work> so I'd get $('url') where I can add .on(), .off(), .one(), .new(), .save(). .remove()
[05:54:28] <Cork> QKO|Work: but jquery is depending on dom for quite a few things
[05:54:36] <QKO|Work> ok
[05:56:55] <Legie> decx: I used you link and add it to website http://eurotruck.greendot.cz/ and my slider on the right side works. But any idea why the second one on the bottom disapeard?
[05:57:51] <Sunzero> Cork ok, you mean i must  defining json as dataTyp in my function ?
[05:58:26] <Cork> Sunzero: the response from the server is most likley sending the header Content-Type: text/html
[05:58:39] <Cork> (default unless you tell it you send something else from a script)
[05:58:49] <Nindustries> Hi, I'm trying to route when the hash changes in my first web app. In some way, nothing is getting caught. Suggestions? http://pastie.org/9616781
[05:58:53] <Cork> so when you send json you need to set the header Content-Type: application/json
[05:59:01] <Cork> else the client side won't know it is json
[05:59:21] <decx> Legie console say prettyPhoto is not a function
[05:59:54] <decx> and dont load 2 jcarousel
[06:00:09] <Cork> Nindustries: what is suppose to catch the hash change?
[06:00:20] <Cork> ah, now i see
[06:00:22] <Nindustries> Cork, the $( window ).hashchange(this.route);
[06:00:23] <decx> i'll be back later
[06:00:51] <Nindustries> I'm not very profecient in JS, so it could be something trivial
[06:01:02] <Nindustries> proficient*
[06:01:05] <Legie> decx : but my function with carousel what is loaded already doesnt work. ok thanks anyway!
[06:02:29] <Cork> Nindustries: and bindEvents is called?
[06:02:43] <Cork> cause this should work as far as i can see
[06:02:44] <Nindustries> Cork, Yes, the first thing in app.initialize()
[06:03:03] <Cork> i meant you have checked that it is actually binding the event handler?
[06:03:13] <Nindustries> How can I check this?
[06:03:56] <Cork> console.log() is normally your fried :)
[06:04:59] <Nindustries> ah ok
[06:06:19] <Nindustries> hm
[06:06:40] <Nindustries> If I replace the hashchange with ( window ).hashchange(console.log('HASHCHANGE')); , it won't even load my page. I do call this.route in the initialize method, so wtf
[06:06:55] <Cork> no no
[06:07:05] <Nindustries> Or I'm declaring it wrong
[06:07:06] <Cork> just console.log('HASHCHANGE') right before it
[06:07:09] <Cork> not in it
[06:07:20] <Nindustries> Wouldn't it be the same thing?
[06:07:29] <Nindustries> (for my case)
[06:07:29] <Cork> no, in it isn't valid
[06:07:32] <Nindustries> oh
[06:08:18] <Cork> also do you have a plugin for hashchange?
[06:08:28] <Cork> that isn't a method on jquery by default
[06:09:19] <Nindustries> oh
[06:09:24] <Nindustries> I tought it was included by default?
[06:09:33] <Cork> not as a shorthand
[06:09:45] <Cork> $(window).on('hashchange', func) is though
[06:11:38] <Nindustries> Now clicking on a <a href="#register" doesn't trigger a routing tough
[06:15:02] <Nindustries> hm.
[06:19:03] <Nindustries> I tried with the plugin, to no avail
[06:19:12] <Nindustries> When I click the button, it doesn't even show up in the URL
[06:21:52] <Nindustries> Anyone else here doing hash based navigation in jQuery mobile?
[06:31:16] <Cork> Nindustries: ah, jqm
[06:31:29] <Cork> Nindustries: that makes a big difference, as jqm uses it by default
[06:31:42] <Cork> so you might be conflicting with the framework
[06:31:53] <Nindustries> oh
[06:33:07] <Nindustries> I'll check that out
[06:34:17] <Nindustries> I set $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; , still no change on button click ;o
[06:34:42] <Cork> Nindustries: can't help you sorry, i don't know much about jqm
[06:35:46] <Nindustries> Cork, np, you helped me at least a bit so thanks
[06:36:04] <Nindustries> Aha! A white page! Im getting somewhere :P
[06:37:01] <Nindustries> Alright, now it renders when I reload the page, but only then.
[06:37:09] <Nindustries> The hash appears in the URL, that's a new thing :)
[06:37:17] <litropy> One-line off-topic break for you all. I don't usually crush on celebs because It's pointless to want what I can't have, but she's incredibly exceptional in a quirky 80s kinda way (music video, pNSFW(middrift exposure and provocative dancing)): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnoz5uBEWOA
[06:37:47] <Nindustries> routing is called, so it must be something with the rendering
[06:41:45] <Nindustries> Underscore.js template rendering that is using an AJAX call
[06:42:03] <Nindustries> Funny thing is, the HTML is there in the source, but the page is still blank
[06:42:11] <litropy> Nindustries, history.pushState is the new king. Supported on everything, as long as you're not worrying about IE9. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[06:43:27] <litropy> Nindustries, if you want a plugin that supports both (using history.pushState, and falling back to hashchange if pushState isn't supported), try history.js https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/
[06:43:39] <Nindustries> thanks litropy
[06:44:23] <litropy> I couldn't get it to work, but that's likely because it was all new to me. I might mess with history.js later on with my current project, but for now, I'm just using pushState, no plugin required.
[06:45:56] <Nindustries> For who wants to try it out; http://d00med.net/cordova/  (try clicking the button and then refresh)
[06:46:55] <litropy> Nindustries, and if you find a browser that unnecessarily fires popstate, let me know, because I sure can't find one, and I couldn't get the code that checked for, and subsequently handled, the unnecessary fire to work, anyway.
[06:47:19] <litropy> I get the feeling it was fixed.
[06:50:13] <litropy> But one thing I did have to do is hack the situation where a user browses the site, then clicks a link to another domain, then clicks back. In that case, of course the browser only accessed cache, and only loads the Ajax'ed content, not the whole page. So I had to do something ugly: stick a script in the Ajaxed content that checks for a fiv that would only be there on full pageload, then if it doesn't find it, immediately document.reload()s
[06:50:37] <litropy> div*
[06:53:27] <Almis90> Can i get the same result without using the merge?
[06:53:27] <Almis90> var form = $(':input').not(':submit,:button,:image,:radio,:checkbox,select');$.merge(form, $(':checked'));
[06:53:40] <Almis90> wow sorry for the space
[06:54:05] <Almis90> Can i get the same result without using the merge? var form = $(':input').not(':submit,:button,:image,:radio,:checkbox,select');$.merge(form, $(':checked'));
[06:56:10] <logikos> i'm trying to get an on change event to detect when the value of an input changes for any reason, however in some cases scripts will change the value, this is a very simple example: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EbIfz
[06:56:21] <logikos> when you click the button it changes the input but the event does not fire
[06:56:50] <logikos> i realize that I could just put the event stuff into a function and call it from each place that might change the box, but in this case that is not realistic
[06:57:00] <logikos> any other ideas?
[06:58:25] <Almis90> logikos in order to change event occur the input text should be unfocused
[06:58:44] <Almis90> so you write something, then press somewhere else and the change event will occur
[06:58:55] <logikos> that part works
[06:59:01] <logikos> but when a script changes the value... ?
[06:59:06] <logikos> any way to catch that?
[06:59:42] <Almis90> oh I not sure let me see
[07:02:34] <Nindustries> If I set some content using .html() and it doesnt show up, do I need to refresh the div or something?
[07:04:17] <pingou> hi
[07:04:41] <codekipple> sup
[07:04:42] <pingou> I'm trying to update the theme I'm using w/ jquery 1.9,2
[07:04:59] <pingou> looking into the css file, it gives me a link
[07:05:21] <pingou> but if I go to that link and click the 'Download theme' I end up with an Internal Server Error
[07:07:29] <pingou> http://fpaste.org/138893/34523814/ for the complete input/output\
[07:08:23] <codekipple> i get this - Error: invalid color "f6f6    f6"
[07:08:35] <codekipple> when i try the link
[07:09:02] <Nindustries> Nobody? :/
[07:09:19] <Almis90> logikos you are here?
[07:09:28] <pingou> codekipple: where do you see this?
[07:10:17] <codekipple> this url - http://download.jqueryui.com/themeroller/parsetheme.css?ffDefault=Helvetica%2CArial%2Csans-serif&fwDefault=bold&fsDefault=1.1em&cornerRadius=2px&bgColorHeader=%23dddddd&bgTextureHeader=highlight_soft&bgImgOpacityHeader=75&borderColorHeader=%23dddddd&fcHeader=%23444444&iconColorHeader=%233c6eb4&bgColorContent=%23ffffff&bgTextureContent=flat&bgImgOpacityContent=75&borderColorContent=%23dddddd&fcContent=%23444444&iconColorContent=%23db3279&bgC

[07:10:22] <Almis90> Nindustries if it doesnt show up I think the element doesnt exist.. can you show your code or example?
[07:10:23] <codekipple> dow=4px&offsetTopShadow=-4px&offsetLeftShadow=-4px&cornerRadiusShadow=8px&bgImgOpacityH%20%20%20%20eader=50&bgI%20%20%20%20mgOpacityHighlight=55&bgColorOv%20%20%20%20erlay=eeeeee&c%20%20%20%20ornerRadiusShadow=0px%22
[07:10:31] <pingou> ...
[07:11:07] <Nindustries> Almis90, try visiting http://d00med.net/cordova and clicking the Register button on the left pane. It'll show a blank page, but when doing Inspect element it shows all the content that should be there.
[07:12:51] <Almis90> Nindustries its because your data-role=page have css display none
[07:13:01] <Nindustries> huh
[07:13:29] <Nindustries> dafuq
[07:14:06] <Almis90> Nindustries you didnt understand
[07:14:07] <Almis90> ?
[07:14:21] <Nindustries> Almis90, Yeah now Im seeing it too, but I don't understand why :P
[07:14:47] <Almis90> just remove in the css file the display none rule and you will be fine
[07:14:51] <Almis90> or create new rule
[07:15:12] <logikos> Almis90: yes, sorry
[07:16:38] <Nindustries> Thanks Almis90 , really thanks. Can't believe I missed that
[07:16:40] <Almis90> logikos I searched for your problem and the only thing that you can do is to add your button click event $('#test').trigger('change');
[07:17:03] <Almis90> Nindustries no problem :)
[07:17:36] <Nindustries> The css appears fucked up tough, reaaaally strange
[07:18:26] <Nindustries> Almis90, try clicking the  button now
[07:20:24] <Almis90> Nindustries if I was you I would make the register form to appear in a modal
[07:20:36] <Nindustries> it's a web app, so no
[07:20:49] <Nindustries> (going to be a phonegap app)
[07:21:00] <Almis90> can you show me how it should be?
[07:21:23] <Nindustries> refresh the page and it will show up fine
[07:23:42] <Nindustries> Apparently the page div misses a bunch of classes when snuck in using .html
[07:24:18] <Nindustries> Diff: https://www.diffchecker.com/nruzj12i
[07:24:46] <Almis90> Nindustries the problem that I see its that the css rules doesnt apply for your dynamically generated elements
[07:25:26] <Nindustries> Apparently jQuery mobile isn't applying classes to elements inserted using .html()
[07:26:12] <codekipple> whats the latest in scroll spying technology? implementing a medium like fade as you scroll hero. Looking for something lightweight
[07:27:09] <Nindustries> So does anyone know how it comes that jQuery mobile isn't inserting it's classes when I insert content manually using .html() ?
[07:27:20] <Almis90> Nindustries never used jquery mobile, cant help you :/
[07:27:27] <Nindustries> Thanks for the help so far Almis90
[07:27:55] <codekipple> i used it once but quite some time ago
[07:30:31] <Almis90> Nindustries i think what you need to do is to reload the jquery mobile js
[07:30:42] <Almis90> one possible solution
[07:31:39] <Nindustries> hmm, I tought .trigger('create') was gonna fix it
[07:33:44] <Almis90> Nindustries just tried Nindustries $('head').append('<script type="text/javascript" src="http://d00med.net/cordova/js/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-rc.1.js"></script>') and it worked
[07:34:10] <Nindustries> hmm
[07:34:37] <Almis90> maybe there is function that you can call that will do that job?
[07:34:54] <Almis90> not reloading the file but rerun the css work
[07:37:34] <Almis90> Nindustries yes  .trigger('create') should fix it
[07:38:51] <Nindustries> We're getting there
[07:38:57] <Nindustries> Now jQuery is undefined again
[07:39:33] <Nindustries> ah, sec
[07:39:47] <Nindustries> W0000000T
[07:39:48] <Nindustries> Wooooooooooooooooot
[07:39:53] <Nindustries> I love you Almis90
[07:39:55] <Nindustries> Really
[07:40:05] * Nindustries gives a beer to Almis90 
[07:41:31] <Nindustries> I looked days for this :D
[07:42:41] <Almis90> Nindustries nice :D
[07:43:03] <Nindustries> W00t
[07:43:36] <Almis90> Nindustries and use the .min versions for faster page loading
[07:43:42] <Almis90> of css and js
[07:44:14] <Nindustries> Yup
[07:44:32] <Nindustries> For the moment, i'll be using the normal ones for when I need to do a modification
[07:45:10] <Almis90> Nindustries never modify the original file
[07:45:13] <Almis90> extend them
[07:45:42] <Nindustries> Ohh no, I mean the css
[07:46:17] <Almis90> Nindustries no, you must not change the css either, extend them instead of modifying
[07:46:34] <Nindustries> Ah
[07:46:36] <Nindustries> I see
[07:46:49] <Almis90> you know how to extend?
[07:49:15] <Nindustries> Isn't that just redeclaring in CSS?
[07:49:28] <Nindustries> the last one specified is the right one?
[07:49:39] <Almis90> yes correct
[07:49:52] <Almis90> just load your css after the jquery mobile css
[07:50:55] <Almis90> the reason is that the user could have downloaded this file from other site that also use this css and so when he will come to your site he will not need to download it again
[07:54:13] <Nindustries> I'm serving it from my website, not from a CDN
[07:59:40] <nonconvergent> I want to log events for debugging. I think I want to lock click, change, and blur events. Anyone know how I could do this?
[08:00:52] <NoiseEee> what does 'log' mean to you
[08:01:33] <BillCriswell> It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.
[08:01:45] <BillCriswell> It's better than bad, it's good.
[08:06:48] <pingou> is there anyone here with access to the logs on jqueryui.com?
[08:08:39] <nonconvergent> NoiseEee: print to console?
[08:09:19] <NoiseEee> nonconvergent: so just console.log on those events!  $(document).on('click',function() { console.log('clicked!'); })
[08:14:01] <negatratoron> Is there a way to "reduce" a jquery selector with several elements selected?
[08:14:19] <negatratoron> I'm using $('.some-class') to select several elements, you see, and I want to get the height of the tallest one
[08:14:40] <negatratoron> so a reduce function would come in handy
[08:15:02] <NoiseEee> well a generic 'reduce' function isn't going to figure that out for you
[08:15:17] <NoiseEee> just iterate over the collection, ie .each() or write a sort function
[08:15:21] <negatratoron> alright
[08:15:31] <negatratoron> i'll just write a for loop :P
[08:16:08] <negatratoron> i think you're right, reduce wouldn't work
[08:16:18] <negatratoron> i think i was thinking of a fold
[08:17:43] <Mhyugh> hello
[08:17:45] <Mhyugh> !!
[08:18:20] <Mhyugh> how can I replace the name attribute for atach an array of objects?
[08:19:07] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: Can you try that question again? Not following.
[08:19:37] <Mhyugh> I have this :: <input type="text" class="field1" name="Activity[]"/>
[08:20:00] <Mhyugh> $("input[name^=Activity]").serializeArray().map(function(e){return e.value;});
[08:20:09] <Mhyugh> and I do this for set all the content into an var
[08:20:17] <Mhyugh> a var*
[08:20:34] <BillCriswell> Right right.
[08:20:38] <Mhyugh> I would like to know for example if I'm going to get the content of a fieldset
[08:20:59] <Mhyugh> the fieldset not supportingname attribute
[08:22:23] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: Do you also have like a <fieldset name="Activity"> or something?
[08:22:34] <Mhyugh> yes
[08:22:53] <BillCriswell> Also, you rpboably want to do $.map( $("input[name^=Activity]").serializeArray(), function(e) { return e.value; });
[08:22:54] <Mhyugh> but with name no because is not compatiblewith filedset tag
[08:23:28] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: http://jsfiddle.net/ can you set up a small example here?
[08:23:36] <BillCriswell> I'm having a hard time following today haha
[08:23:41] <Mhyugh> ok
[08:26:59] <Mhyugh> http://jsfiddle.net/48odose0/
[08:27:07] <Mhyugh> BillCriswell : is this
[08:28:11] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: Oh, what's not doing what you're thinking?
[08:28:35] <jimi_> to detect a dom element being created, i also have to fire the create event when i create it correct?
[08:28:38] <Mhyugh> http://jsfiddle.net/48odose0/1/
[08:28:50] <Mhyugh> and like this will be with fieldset tag
[08:29:42] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: So you want the fieldset text in with the data?
[08:29:51] <Mhyugh> yes
[08:29:59] <Mhyugh> the content of filedset exactly
[08:30:42] <BillCriswell> I mean, you can get that with $('fieldset').text()... but something stinks here
[08:31:45] <BillCriswell> What do you want the data to end up looking like on your end?
[08:32:40] <Mhyugh> http://jsfiddle.net/48odose0/2/
[08:32:53] <Mhyugh> there are several fieldset tags
[08:32:56] <Mhyugh> like this
[08:33:09] <Mhyugh> so Ineed to get all the content like inputs
[08:33:12] <NoiseEee> thats an improper use of fieldsets
[08:33:15] <NoiseEee> create better html
[08:33:18] <NoiseEee> work smarter not harder
[08:33:58] <Mhyugh> What happen is inside the fieldset I have some php atgs
[08:34:01] <Mhyugh> tags*
[08:34:12] <dimitrovskif> Hi guys, can I make $(document).ready to call a handler which is a part of an object? And still preserve the "this" (context) inside the handler?
[08:34:25] <Mhyugh> so I tested put them inside a hidden input, but show them anyway
[08:34:53] <NoiseEee> Mhyugh: post the real, rendered html from you php somewhere, use proper html markup, and come back with your questions/fiddle
[08:34:55] <BillCriswell> dimitrovskif: $(document).ready(App.init);
[08:35:16] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: App.prototype.init = function(){ alert(this); }
[08:35:40] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: AFAIK "this" will be $(document)
[08:36:02] <BillCriswell> Mhyugh: You can just serialize the whole form by doing $('form').serializeArray()
[08:36:37] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: ?
[08:36:58] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: can I somehow change the context of the handler to be "App" instance
[08:37:06] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: instead of $(document)
[08:40:25] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: bump
[08:40:41] <shoky> dimitrovskif: $(document).ready(App.init.bind(App))  would do that
[08:40:43] <BillCriswell> dimitrovskif: You can do $(document).ready(function(){ App.init(); }); instead?
[08:40:54] <shoky> or that ^
[08:41:02] <BillCriswell> I'd like to shoky though.
[08:41:13] <shoky> hmm
[08:41:41] <BillCriswell> hmmmm indeed.
[08:41:59] <shoky> can't argue with that
[08:42:27] <BillCriswell> Can you argue againt pizza at 11:42 in the AM?
[08:42:52] <shoky> never
[08:42:59] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:43:00] <dimitrovskif> BillCriswell: shoky init is a  hmm; I can't call App.init btw; App is not an instance - it's the name of the 'class' (whatever you call them in JS community)
[08:43:03] <BillCriswell> in that case I'll be back.
[08:43:36] <shoky> dimitrovskif ok then don't. you asked for it ;p
[08:43:50] <shoky> enjoy Bill
[08:44:01] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning everybody
[08:44:15] <shoky> halo duch
[08:44:16] <dimitrovskif> shoky: var App = function(){ $(document).ready(WHATHERE); }; App.prototype.init = function(){ }
[08:44:28] <shoky> dimitrovskif: huh?
[08:44:50] <dimitrovskif> shoky: how do I call init when document is ready
[08:45:01] <shoky> how do you call init on what object ?
[08:45:19] <shoky> and why would you put that in the App constructor :\
[08:45:23] <robertmaxrees> dimitrovskif that's a really strange pattern to use.
[08:46:10] <robertmaxrees> if you want to go with a big ol' monolithic object, craft all your methods and stuff separately, then you call the init separately.
[08:47:24] <shoky> dimitrovskif:  maybe you wanted:   var App = function() { $(document).ready( this.init.bind(this) ) }
[08:47:50] <dimitrovskif> shoky: that will work :O ?
[08:47:57] <shoky> possibly :P
[08:48:20] <dimitrovskif> shoky: TypeError: this.bind is not a function; nope
[08:48:26] <dimitrovskif> shoky: oops
[08:48:32] <robertmaxrees> because `this` isn't the right object
[08:48:47] <robertmaxrees> the general idea is right, though.
[08:49:02] <dimitrovskif> yeah it works now
[08:49:17] <dimitrovskif> I am really doing a huge anti-pattern though
[08:49:29] <shoky> at least you're aware ;)
[08:49:49] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[08:49:53] <robertmaxrees> and for that, you get a big ol' ++
[08:50:11] <shoky> ;D
[09:06:40] <dimitrovskif> https://bpaste.net/show/4fc2ab65db4f <--- does something like this exist?
[09:07:30] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, you just use a document ready and select the element.
[09:07:39] <robertmaxrees> if the element doesn't exist, most methods don't run.
[09:07:41] <dimitrovskif> I am looking for some MVC-y or more enterprise-y (lol) approach because my code is ugly and hard to refactor
[09:07:54] <robertmaxrees> check out Backbone, React, and Riot.
[09:07:58] <dimitrovskif> but I a still not ready for ng
[09:07:59] <robertmaxrees> if you want MV*
[09:08:24] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could look into getting into a simple design pattern to help you move forward.
[09:09:06] <dimitrovskif> it's also hard to split logic and UI/DOM
[09:09:12] <robertmaxrees> not at all :)
[09:09:28] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: any good jQuery project?
[09:09:44] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[09:11:20] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: my projects end up looking like $("#formXX").submit(function(){ $(this).doSth(); n = $(this).find("selector").doUIThings(); doLogic(); } and it's hard to refactor or develop at all
[09:11:32] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: form validation and plugins dont help that much
[09:12:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because you're doing a lot of inlined functiones.
[09:12:58] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: I am splitting stuff into more functions, but they are still at the same namespace and messy.
[09:13:09] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: so I am looking for good projects using jQuery
[09:13:17] <robertmaxrees> focus on making pure functions to start with.
[09:13:25] <robertmaxrees> that'll really help you i think.
[09:14:02] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: DOM state is a bitch in my projects
[09:14:19] <robertmaxrees> don't use the DOM to hold state ;)
[09:14:29] <robertmaxrees> this is where things like Backbone, React, Riot, and Angular come in handy.
[09:14:56] <dimitrovskif> can I use those without # URLs
[09:15:03] <dimitrovskif> I don't want a single-page app
[09:15:12] <robertmaxrees> sure can - that's just routing.
[09:15:14] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/yysdL033/ any idea how to insert into the drop area other content than the "DRAG" content?
[09:15:17] <robertmaxrees> i don't personally like angular, fwiw.
[09:15:27] <dimitrovskif> I don't get Angular's fuss
[09:15:28] <robertmaxrees> riot is super simple for two-way data binding, if that's what you want.
[09:15:40] <dimitrovskif> I do want two-way data binding, but other things too
[09:15:47] <dimitrovskif> I want something strict, that will make sure I can
[09:15:53] <robertmaxrees> then backbone is what you want.
[09:15:54] <BillCriswell> I'm digging vuejs.
[09:15:55] <dimitrovskif> *can't mess up code structure
[09:16:18] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking of it as Angular training wheels haha
[09:17:01] <dimitrovskif> As much as other people hate frameworks that force a certain paradigm, I love that. I want something strict that will force me to separate logic, have namespaces and make everything dynamic
[09:17:03] <robertmaxrees> dimitrovskif you could always structure code like this btw: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4a7mm9c5/1/
[09:17:31] <robertmaxrees> be functionally pure.  sometimes it's worth it just to get a pretty name on what's currently happening.
[09:18:15] <robertmaxrees> (this is a contrived example and not necessarily pretty, but it should illustrate the point)
[09:19:07] <robertmaxrees> even with an MV*, you're still going to have to grapple with understanding how to separate logic from data.
[09:22:41] <nonconvergent> Is there a way to listen for an event when a user has entered a zip code? I have a zip code input, which is masked, and right now I check the event on blur and change, but that requires, usually, a blur event on the user's part.
[09:23:03] <robertmaxrees> the keydown, keypress, and input events exist, as well.
[09:23:37] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: I don't know how that would work...particularly if the user backspaces.
[09:23:49] <robertmaxrees> what are you wanting then?
[09:23:55] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to validate the input?
[09:25:03] <nonconvergent> Something like that.  Imagine a box with that takes a zipcode. I need to listen for an event that fires when you have entered that zipcode, rather than when you have entered it and blurred it.
[09:25:25] <nonconvergent> like, on the fifth character.
[09:25:42] <decx> on input check value length
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> there is no singular event for "user has entered a zip code" - you can listen for each keypress or keydown and detect length to see where the user is at.
[09:26:20] <robertmaxrees> when they've hit the threshold, validate the input.
[09:28:05] <dimitrovskif> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/fbc67e452e69 how do I improve tis
[09:28:44] <robertmaxrees> don't return false; out of event handlers.
[09:29:02] <robertmaxrees> also, learn about scoping.
[09:30:25] <robertmaxrees> your formEvents method is implicit - if you really want to separate data from logic, you'd need to pass the form explicitly. same with the inputs you care about.
[09:31:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm not a fan of this "monolithip app object with an initi function" thing because it's kind of a PITA>
[09:33:00] <dmsuperman> "this.hideInp" is probably not what you' think it is
[09:33:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'd have to explicitly bind that to the correct context.
[09:42:31] <litropy> Do you guys have jQuery syntax highlighters running in IRC or are ya just that good :P
[09:43:02] <robertmaxrees> half the time i copy/paste into sublime, autoformat, and lint it before actually poking at it
[09:43:32] <pingou> robertmaxrees: don't reveal your secret and just call it: talent ;-)
[09:43:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:43:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm lazy - like most good programmers
[09:43:57] <robertmaxrees> lint yo shiz.
[09:44:03] <dougrchamberlain> Hello all!
[09:48:09] <Omar-> hi robertmaxrees
[09:57:16] <robertmaxrees> what a day.
[10:26:18] <daynaskully> {Q} where should i start research on single page apps (like how to transition between "pages" and not execute queries until they're loaded)
[10:31:56] <robertmaxrees> daynaskully depends - what's your familiarity with js overall?
[10:33:36] <daynaskully> robertmaxrees:: medium familiarity? I know the basics in transitioning different divs around as "pages" just not the best practices and when the divs would have specific code/functions etc that i woulln't want executed on initial page laod
[10:34:47] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of convoluting stuff.  your main "app" js file should have all that code in it and rely on either dynaimcally binding listeners (yuck) or leaning on event delegation (yay!) to handle stuff.
[10:38:31] <Leh> hey there
[10:38:54] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[10:39:22] <Leh> i have problems with comparing the attr. value to a string
[10:39:29] <Leh> so i have $(this).attr('value')==='-'
[10:40:10] <Leh> with an if clause
[10:40:12] <robertmaxrees> Leh use .val() for that.
[10:40:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'd actually want .prop(), not attr.
[10:40:51] <Leh> i want the attribute value of an <input
[10:41:04] <robertmaxrees> right, use .val()
[10:41:14] <robertmaxrees> .attr() accesses the markup, which isn't what you want.
[10:41:18] <robertmaxrees> you want the value property within the DOM.
[10:43:06] <paOol_> hi, does anyone know of a responsive slider that has a 'peek' effect, where you can see part of the next slide
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> Leh http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/
[10:44:35] <robertmaxrees> .attr() is the wrong thing to use on inputs.  .val() is what you want for inputs.
[10:45:05] <Leh> http://pastebin.com/2XvGAeLd
[10:45:20] <Leh> i have that function on the some buttons
[10:45:44] <Leh> the button looks like this :
[10:45:59] <Leh> <input type="button" class="expanddetails" name="expanddetails" value="+" id="re98">
[10:46:09] <Leh> and for some reason
[10:46:33] <Leh> only second button generated
[10:46:35] <Leh> works
[10:46:42] <Leh> i mean every second one
[10:46:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k7887gnr/
[10:47:00] <robertmaxrees> use else if in there btw.
[10:48:17] <Leh> yeah had that
[10:49:28] <Leh> ah ok well looks like there is a problem with something else
[10:49:30] <Leh> ty
[10:49:41] <robertmaxrees> is it not working for buttons you add after the page has loaded?
[10:50:03] <Leh> y
[10:50:11] <robertmaxrees> then you need event delegation.
[10:50:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k7887gnr/1/
[10:51:36] <robertmaxrees> replace the "div" part of $('div').on('click', '.expanddetails', function() { with the parent element you're appending things to.
[10:52:12] <whatadewitt> hey, is it possible to change the anchors in jquery ui datepicker to be... not... anchors :S
[10:53:01] <robertmaxrees> not without modifying the source (don't do this)
[10:53:03] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[11:05:33] <Leh> thx robertmaxrees
[11:05:44] <Leh> delegation was indeed the problem
[11:05:49] <Leh> totally forgot about it ^^
[11:05:53] <robertmaxrees> *solution ;)
[11:06:01] <Leh> yeah :-)
[11:07:54] <litropy> I need a free text editor that has a function navigatior. Any recommendations?
[11:09:04] <tw2113> sublime text has a trial period that they don't strictly enforce last i checked
[11:09:09] <litropy> Linux compatible
[11:09:22] <tw2113> sublime text is available on linux
[11:09:26] <robertmaxrees> there's a linux version
[11:10:03] <litropy> Hmm. Really? I really don't want to get used to it then have to get another one.
[11:10:13] <tw2113> you could always purchase it
[11:10:16] <pingou> geany works for me
[11:10:21] <tw2113> it's worth it
[11:10:22] <robertmaxrees> "get another one"?
[11:10:30] <tw2113> pays for itself
[11:10:35] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[11:11:33] <litropy> I hear ya, guys.
[11:11:42] <litropy> Thx, I'll check out sublime
[11:12:28] <robertmaxrees> i was skeptical on it for a long time, but package control and the command palatte really won me over.
[11:14:22] <litropy> Man. I love the minicode slider on the right
[11:14:43] <robertmaxrees> i actually turn that off half the time hahaha
[11:15:47] <tw2113> ctrl+k+b toggles the file browser
[11:15:56] <tw2113> in case you want to hide that for a bit
[11:16:24] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+shift+p for the command palatte, ctrl+p for the filesearch dealio.
[11:18:59] <litropy> Yep. I'm in love.
[11:19:27] <litropy> Didn't take long. Another hour and I won't live without it.
[11:19:59] <litropy> All I had to do was type a line lol
[11:20:54] <ksprwhite> jquery or AngularJs ? ( to_be || !to_be )
[11:21:04] <robertmaxrees> ksprwhite both together....
[11:21:08] <robertmaxrees> different tools
[11:21:11] <maxbucknell> It depends
[11:22:06] <robertmaxrees> one is a DOM abstraction library, the other is an MV* framework.
[11:22:34] <ksprwhite> what is the best model view framework in Js ?
[11:23:03] <robertmaxrees> I like Riot and Backbone.  React is a neat spin on data binding.
[11:25:54] <ksprwhite> I'll see riot, thanks
[11:27:24] <seu_barriga> hello
[11:28:14] <seu_barriga> I'm trying to send an ajax request to my application to retrieve the currently logged user in a json object, however, the response is always blank
[11:28:31] <seu_barriga> but if I access my application directly through my browser, the object appears
[11:28:39] <seu_barriga> what could be happening?
[11:28:51] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ seu_barriga
[11:28:51] <b-ot> seu_barriga: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:29:23] <maxbucknell> b-ot: why is jsfiddle preferred over jsbin? Any particular reason?
[11:29:23] <b-ot> maxbucknell: it is decidedly so.
[11:29:34] <robertmaxrees> maxbucknell b-ot is a bot hahaha
[11:30:00] <robertmaxrees> and it tends to be the more favored one around here.  jsbin has a kind of awkward workflow to a lot of us.
[11:30:02] <maxbucknell> robertmaxrees Well I have to say in hindsight that seems kinda obvious
[11:30:03] <robertmaxrees> but either is fine.
[11:30:15] <seu_barriga> robertmaxrees, http://fixee.org/paste/rf2wlp1/
[11:30:25] <joepie91_> stupid question, perhaps; I'm looking to emit an event *downwards* - that is, having it propagate through its children rather than its parents... is this possible with jQuery's default event mechanism?
[11:30:30] <joepie91_> a custom event
[11:30:30] <puchacz> hi, is there a library that can resize iframe in the same manner as by pushing zoom in / zoom out buttons in browser?
[11:30:52] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ you can't do that.
[11:31:39] <joepie91_> okay... any suggested approach for implementing such?
[11:31:44] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ you can't.
[11:31:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not the way the  event model works.
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> there IS, however, a capture phase you should check out, which natively does that.
[11:32:45] <robertmaxrees> seu_barriga put any code that reliex on the returned data in a .done() callback.
[11:32:50] <nonconvergent> Okay, I'm trying this, but it doesn't trigger when I enter five digits into my input field. https://gist.github.com/nonconvergent/3fea496da12d02f246dd
[11:33:01] <seu_barriga> ok, just a sec
[11:33:15] <joepie91_> I'd run across some references to the capture phase already, but it's unclear to me how to "correctly" do this with jQuery in a generally cross-browser fashion (except for IE, it is explicitly not supported)
[11:33:29] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ what exactly ARE you trying to do?  and why?
[11:33:39] <robertmaxrees> seu_barriga so basically $.ajax(/* your stuff here */).done(function(data) {console.log(data)});
[11:34:03] <nonconvergent> The idea being that it should trigger when the user has entered a 5 digit zip.
[11:34:23] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent you want .val()
[11:34:25] <robertmaxrees> not .val
[11:34:52] <litropy> Omg. It even have a package management system.
[11:35:03] <robertmaxrees> litropy yep - package control is the shiz.
[11:35:10] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: I'm working on some custom UI toolkit of sorts using AngularJS, and I expect to have to broadcast a few events downwards such as 'resize' events (these may be triggered by resizable elements or a viewport resize, and the dimension/position logic goes beyond what CSS can natively provide) - and as I've found out, AngularJS scopes don't inherit the way I thought they did, so that option is out
[11:35:17] <joepie91_> I'm effectively looking for a jQuery/DOM equivalent to $emit
[11:35:23] <joepie91_> err, $broadcast
[11:35:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you need to broadcast downwards, but it sounds like you'll need ot manually enumerate through every parent element until you get to the final child you care about,
[11:36:24] <joepie91_> that was the idea I had - just manually trigger handles on child elements - but I was just wondering if there was a faster/better/cleaner option :)

[11:36:45] <seu_barriga> the response's still empty
[11:36:46] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ http://www.quirksmode.org/js/introevents.html this is a good primer.
[11:36:58] <joepie91_> (the resize has to be propagated downwards because if eg. a panel resizes, all of its children need to have their sizes recalculated as well, but at the point where a child doesn't actually resize, none of *its* children have to be resized)
[11:37:22] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ err, you should let your CSS handle all of that for you.
[11:37:26] <litropy> You guys should have this thing in the MOTD
[11:37:26] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: will have a read, thanks
[11:37:43] <joepie91_> CSS doesn't always let me do cleanly what I'm trying to accomplish :)
[11:37:48] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ sure it does.
[11:37:50] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Hmm, I don't think that's working.  It showing it immediately on input.
[11:38:28] <robertmaxrees> seu_barriga check out your network panel - is everything happening correctly?
[11:38:34] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you've got something else going on.
[11:38:36] <nonconvergent> Actually, it shows it after the user has backspaced through the initial value, then types 2 characters
[11:38:42] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: CSS has shortcomings and/or the required features (eg. flexbox) are insufficiently supported cross-browser, hence using JS
[11:38:53] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ you don't need flexbox in this case.
[11:38:58] <seu_barriga> robertmaxrees, the request is being made, but if I check the response, nothing appears
[11:39:06] <joepie91_> with the thing I am trying to achieve, I *am* going to need flexbox
[11:39:08] <robertmaxrees> seu_barriga then it sounds like you have a server problem.
[11:39:13] <joepie91_> for particular aspects of the layouting
[11:39:15] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent can you setup a fiddle?
[11:39:41] <seu_barriga> robertmaxrees, but why does it return the object when I access the url normally?
[11:39:43] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ i'd still rethink relying on capture-phase event stuff for layout concerns, but whatever floats your boat.
[11:39:46] <robertmaxrees> seu_barriga i have no clue.
[11:39:51] <seu_barriga> ok
[11:39:58] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like your server is expecting a different get request.
[11:40:02] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: I'd like to if possible, it's just completely unclear to me how to do so
[11:40:07] <seu_barriga> thx anyway, I'll check my server
[11:40:07] <robertmaxrees> take out the data, datatype, and crossdomain arguments.
[11:40:08] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Not really, don't have a good mockup.
[11:40:16] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ http://www.quirksmode.org/js/introevents.html read this.
[11:40:23] <joepie91_> yes, that tab is currently open
[11:40:25] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent okay i'll make one for you.
[11:40:27] <joepie91_> :)
[11:41:58] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h2ff32ot/
[11:42:05] <litropy> Hahaha color scheme Amy is all purple
[11:42:37] <nonconvergent> Maybe it's the inputmaske('99999');
[11:45:56] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: reading through it, I have a few questions; a) does jQuery facilitate registering an event in the capturing phase, b) what is the capturing phase equivalent of stopPropagation?
[11:46:25] <joepie91_> events_order.html only appears to list stopPropagation as a bubbling phase thing, without saying anything about the capture phase, unless I overlooked it
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> afaik there is no equivalent.
[11:47:00] <joepie91_> aha.
[11:47:23] <robertmaxrees> also: you're convoluting concepts.
[11:47:53] <joepie91_> in what way?
[11:48:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery event handling is distinct from browser event handling, and you don't register events in any phase - you register listeners for the events
[11:49:01] <chevdor> Hi guys, having an issue with CORS trying to access tthe API from blockchain.info. http://jsfiddle.net/chevdor/L916L6w6/
[11:49:26] <joepie91_> sorry, I meant registering listeners, typo on my end - as for it being distinct from browser event handling, I thought jQuery just wrapped a layer around browser handling for cross-browser compat?
[11:49:36] <joepie91_> or does it have its own event processing system entirely?
[11:50:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:50:10] <robertmaxrees> chevdor okay - what do you want us to do about it?
[11:50:30] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: if you have an idea, you may share it!
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> chevdor CORS is CORS - you can't work around it.
[11:50:46] <joepie91_> aha, that makes things a bit more complicated I suppose - does jQuery have an equivalent of the capture phase or am I stuck with manually broadcasting events downwards using triggerHandler?
[11:51:03] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: except if the server handles it as blockchain claims to do
[11:51:05] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ you should really reevaluate what you're doing in the first place IMO>
[11:51:14] <robertmaxrees> you can't pull content from a remote domain unless that domain explicitly allows it.
[11:51:15] <robertmaxrees> soooo.
[11:51:33] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Yeah, mine is triggering after 2. Weird.
[11:51:47] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent then you have something else going on.  dunno.
[11:52:13] <nonconvergent> Bootstrap.
[11:52:28] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't change anything, but okay.
[11:52:32] <nonconvergent> class="input-mini"
[11:52:44] <robertmaxrees> without a fiddle/bin it's hard to help =/  sorry
[11:52:45] <nonconvergent> And it's rendered with an existing value.
[11:54:09] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: if you have a better proposed solution for my problem (assuming that 'resize handling is partially in JS' is a fixed requirement), it'd be very welcome :)
[11:54:39] <joepie91_> (I really dislike using JS for anything to do with styling/layout, but I've already established that there's really no other way to implement what I want to implement... and it's a bit too complex to explain at this point)
[11:54:43] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ CSS.  i don't understand why percentages are insufficient for what you need.  i'd have to see an example for what you're doing.
[11:55:21] <joepie91_> see above; it's too complex to explain the entire picture right now, but plain CSS alone is insufficient for what I want
[11:55:24] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: Yeah, just tried a fiddle and it works fine.
[11:55:29] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ then good luck.
[11:55:39] <nonconvergent> So I dunno.
[11:55:44] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: thanks for your help :)
[11:56:03] <robertmaxrees> when you get to cases like "this is really complicated and too hard to explain but i need to lean on the event model to fix styling issues", something seems off.
[11:57:59] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: if your comment (missing jsfiddle) was related to my question, I did create one: http://jsfiddle.net/chevdor/L916L6w6/
[11:58:20] <robertmaxrees> chevdor wait how is this a CORS issue?
[11:58:51] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: my browser is quite clear about that unfortunately
[11:58:54] <paOol_> hi, does anyone know of a responsive slider that has a 'peek' effect, where you can see part of the next slide
[11:59:51] <robertmaxrees> chevdor i'm not seeing anything about CORS here.
[12:00:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing your alert.
[12:00:50] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: would you like to see the error I get in my browser´s console? indeed, jsfiddle does not report that but it fails as well.
[12:01:06] <robertmaxrees> chevdor uh, sure?
[12:01:09] <robertmaxrees> lost about what's going ok.
[12:01:35] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: you can see the message in this updated version http://jsfiddle.net/chevdor/L916L6w6/3/
[12:02:24] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: I tried to get around using jsonp but I then get another issue… I love CORS :)
[12:03:00] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if they're blocking requests from URLs like "localhost"
[12:03:26] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: I was indeed thinking about that but I dont see the point… it could be it though
[12:03:42] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: that´s why I tried with jsfiddle
[12:03:50] <robertmaxrees> which obviously works.
[12:04:05] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: which… does not complain the same way :)
[12:04:22] <robertmaxrees> chevdor right.
[12:04:54] <chevdor> robertmaxrees: id get data in jsfiddle, I would comclude indeed that the issue is my localhost...
[12:22:45] <jy_> Hello. I am new to jquery and I am trying to use some of the example source code online. I created identical files on my webserver with all of the dependencies and somehow I am getting different results concerning styles.
[12:24:15] <robertmaxrees> jy_ care to elaborate?
[12:24:17] <jy_> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/tabs/default.html in particular is what I'm experimenting with
[12:24:28] <NoiseEee> did you include the jqueryui stylesheet?
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have the css included
[12:24:39] <Sunzero> someone any idea why i dont get a result  (the php work)  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ce0c3c1e03efcd13ed9c
[12:24:41] <nonconvergent> If I want to 'grey out' a <select/> temporarily, so that I can sell set and get the val() of it but the user won't go thinking they can manipulate it, and also 'ungrey' it after I've added valid options based on other actions, what would I do?
[12:24:51] <nonconvergent> s/sell//
[12:25:17] <jy_> the stylesheet is linked in line 6 so it should still work, right?
[12:25:19] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent set .prop('disabled', true); on it.
[12:25:21] <NoiseEee> nonconvergent: go for it?  set/remove the disabled attribute?
[12:25:34] <schemanic> Hello. I'm very new to JQuery, but I need help with the DataTables plugin and how I'm initializing it on a table that's being refreshed constantly
[12:25:54] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero that's a reaslly strange thing do to.
[12:26:16] <nonconvergent> $('#mySelectId').prop('disabled',[true|false]); ?
[12:26:25] <nonconvergent> trying it
[12:26:45] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent  $('#mySelectId').prop('disabled', false); and  $('#mySelectId').prop('disabled', true);
[12:26:46] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[12:27:02] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero your code doesn't really make much sense.
[12:27:13] <schemanic> The table I'm working with is inside a div that's being rerun as input elements are filled. I have a script that's initializing the datatable instance but my table doesn't start out existing, it gets made after the params get updated
[12:27:26] <jy_> so as far as i can tell the css isn't included at all
[12:27:34] <jy_> well
[12:27:38] <jy_> it should be
[12:27:43] <jy_> but it's not
[12:28:00] <Jon31> my website runs fine, but when i enable the smart phone emulator in chrome, some of the javascript breaks, some functionalities stop working, but there's no error output in the console.. any ideas  how to debug this kinda problem?
[12:28:15] <schemanic> Is there a way to instead of run the datatables initialization code whenever the table updates/is refreshed rather than when the document is ready?
[12:28:31] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees hmm i try to get the result of the php file in json
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero your lfg var isn't available in your .done() callback, and adding something to the first index of an array is... strange.
[12:28:55] <NoiseEee> Sunzero: but why when the page loads?  why don't you just load the page *with it*?
[12:29:13] <NoiseEee> Sunzero: by setting a key of '1' before 0 / not pushing, your array is really an object
[12:29:19] <NoiseEee> Sunzero: so a few things goofy are going on
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use a constructor for those.
[12:29:57] <robertmaxrees> use literals.
[12:30:19] <Sunzero> NoiseEee its only a test
[12:30:56] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero your code doesn't work though ;)
[12:30:57] <NoiseEee> Sunzero: well the test stinks, so if its only a 'test', write another
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero http://fixee.org/paste/9tpul2w/ this is probably closer to what you're looking for.
[12:31:44] <nonconvergent> robertmaxrees: thanks
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> nonconvergent deffo
[12:32:30] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees thx
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[12:32:44] <robertmaxrees> you were getting tripped up in scope.
[12:33:07] <rfish> hey I am using the moment library
[12:33:22] <rfish> and I keep getting Accessing Moment through the global scope is deprecated, and will be removed in an upcoming release.
[12:33:32] <rfish> how do I prevent this?
[12:33:42] <robertmaxrees> don't access it through the global scope?
[12:33:53] <rfish> how do you not access it through the global scope?
[12:34:09] <rfish> I tried doing var m = moment
[12:34:15] <rfish> and then m(new Date())
[12:34:21] <rfish> and I still get that message
[12:34:25] <jy_> Can someone try out http://pastebin.com/Ftze2ZYZ and point out what I've screwed up?
[12:35:02] <jy_> It's identical to the demo at http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/tabs/default.html but I changed one of the linked css's to properly pull the fonts
[12:35:04] <robertmaxrees> jy_ are you loading this via a local server or off your hard drive?
[12:35:11] <jy_> a local server
[12:35:52] <jy_> the second css loads fine
[12:36:02] <jy_> the first one doesn't seem to take for some reason
[12:36:29] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees hmm but console.log(msg) show nothing
[12:36:40] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero then your server isn't returning anything.
[12:37:06] <robertmaxrees> jy_ remopve the second stylesheet.
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> leave the first.
[12:37:32] <robertmaxrees> that should be all you need
[12:37:39] <jy_> well... wow
[12:37:59] <jy_> so we can only link to one remote css at a time?
[12:38:03] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do many.
[12:38:15] <robertmaxrees> but you dont' need the second one.
[12:38:16] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees  hmm no the php file give me a result iam really sure.
[12:38:32] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero then your AJAX call is bad.  check the network panel.
[12:38:44] <jy_> so why does it work on the demo page, but not on my local server?
[12:38:53] <jy_> What's the difference?
[12:39:45] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3c8d291cb18d152d4d85
[12:39:48] <fission6> how do i get all divs immeditly under <li>
[12:39:55] <Sunzero> i think is its ok
[12:40:16] <BillCriswell> fission6: li > div
[12:40:19] <robertmaxrees> jy_ one sec.
[12:41:11] <jy_> ok weird... i readded the second sheet and it's still working?
[12:41:35] <jy_> robertmaxrees, I don't think you can help me since I'm clearly lost at what even I was trying to do :)
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> jy_ i set everything up locally and it's working fine.
[12:42:09] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[12:42:30] <jy_> Yeah suddenly mine started working too
[12:42:35] <jy_> I'm a little lost
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> cache probably.
[12:42:54] <jy_> likely
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero sounds like your server isn't responding correctly?
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> no clue mano.
[12:45:24] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees the result of the php file is {'Ma': true, 'Zo': true}
[12:45:37] <robertmaxrees> Sunzero check the raw response using your network panel
[12:45:49] <robertmaxrees> hitting it directly is not the same as hitting it via ajax
[12:46:10] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: fwiw, finished downwards event propagation implementation; http://sprunge.us/dXcU?js
[12:46:28] <t4nk326> why wont my jquery work in fiddle?
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> woah uh joepie91_ you're doing some kind of dangerous stuff in there.
[12:47:10] <Mhyugh> Hello!
[12:47:12] <robertmaxrees> t4nk326 you're not including jquery in the fiddle.
[12:47:23] <t4nk326> http://jsfiddle.net/7ZVb7/2873/
[12:47:31] <Sunzero> robertmaxrees the raw response is the same ... {'Ma': true, 'Zo': true}
[12:47:40] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: I don't doubt that I am, but I've tried to keep it as sane as possible - what specifically do you see a problem with?
[12:48:00] <helliax_work> Hello!
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ the event object is indended to be read-only.  don't write over it yourself.
[12:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you have undeclared vars that'll pollute the global space.
[12:48:48] <robertmaxrees> those are the two big problems.
[12:48:57] <joepie91_> re: undeclared vars, whoops, that was because of some var name changes, will fix that straight away
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm still not convinced this is a good solution, but w/e
[12:49:24] <joepie91_> as for overwriting the event object; I was unable to figure out a better method to stop propagation separately across branches
[12:49:33] <robertmaxrees> joepie91_ e.preventDefault()
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> rather, e.stopImmediatePropagation()
[12:50:21] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: huh?
[12:50:21] <Mhyugh> http://jsfiddle.net/dgyzkfqw/
[12:50:30] <joepie91_> hold on, let me fiddle to show what I'm doing
[12:50:58] <Mhyugh> How can I re-order the inputs with this way
[12:50:59] <joepie91_> just realized that's probably not clear from the plugin code alone
[12:51:20] <robertmaxrees> i need to go get lunch
[12:51:22] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[12:52:02] <Legie> Hello guys! I have the easiest script (jcarousel) for changing <li>`s and it works when i put it on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7tgxofqp/5/    i use this on my website and it doesnt work. Does anybody know where can I go find problem? website is: http://eurotruck.greendot.cz/ (reference on the right)
[12:52:23] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/6n9258h8/
[12:52:49] <joepie91_> when independent branches are enabled, the stopPropagation in <three> will only cancel the propagation in that branch
[12:52:57] <joepie91_> and the propagation down <four> and <five> will continue
[12:52:59] <joepie91_> (see console)
[12:53:20] <joepie91_> with upwards bubbling you only ever have one "next" DOM element (o
[12:53:22] <joepie91_> (single parent)
[12:53:28] <joepie91_> but with downwards bubbling this is an additional issue
[12:53:40] <Woet> joepie91_ is a single parent.
[12:56:57] <joepie91_> (when it is set to false, then stopPropagation at any point will completely stop propagation regardless of the branch, per spec)
[13:00:51] <jy_> Ok wow, weird
[13:00:58] <jy_> so it must be a chrome issue?
[13:01:10] <jy_> It randomly fails to load this huge css
[13:02:19] <NoiseEee> sounds suspicious jy_
[13:02:20] <jy_> IE is loading it properly
[13:02:40] <jy_> well almost
[13:10:52] <stan_man_can> How can I detect a checkbox value changing?
[13:11:08] <stan_man_can> via mouse click and spacebar
[13:12:07] <Legie> Hello guys! I have the easiest script (jcarousel) for changing <li>`s and it works when i put it on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7tgxofqp/5/    i use this on my website and it doesnt work. Does anybody know where can I go find problem? website is: http://eurotruck.greendot.cz/ (reference on the right)
[13:12:16] <NoiseEee> stan_man_can: both of those fire the 'click' event
[13:12:37] <stan_man_can> NoiseEee: ah awesome thans
[13:12:40] <stan_man_can> thanks*
[13:12:52] <NoiseEee> stan_man_can: but what do you mean detecting the *value* of the checkbox changing?  do you mean the state of being checked?
[13:13:10] <stan_man_can> NoiseEee: Well yeah just detecting when it’s been checked or unchecked
[13:13:18] <NoiseEee> gotcha
[13:13:21] <stan_man_can>  :)
[13:13:55] <dr4ke> Anyone in here familiar with ScrollMagic?
[13:17:01] <jy_> Noisee this is the weirdest thing
[13:17:21] <jy_> The CSS just fails completely
[13:21:42] <stan_man_can> is it possible to have two submit buttons on a form and to do different things based on which one is clicked?
[13:21:44] <NoiseEee> sorry jy_ did you get a fiddle up?
[13:21:58] <stan_man_can> I mean I know i can catch the event and check some values but is that bad practice?
[13:22:16] <joepie91_> stan_man_can: the problem you will encounter: when the user hits enter, what do you do?
[13:22:16] <NoiseEee> stan_man_can: a better idea would be to have them both as regular buttons that might set a value in a hidden field or something, then submit the form via $(form).submit()
[13:22:51] <stan_man_can> the user fills out a few values and searches for results, and then has the option to export those results to a CSV, would be much easiser to just have the form submit to a different page based on the button
[13:23:03] <stan_man_can> Noisee: ah good call thanks :)
[13:23:30] <stan_man_can> NoiseEee: on click I”ll just set the action path and then submit
[13:23:38] <joepie91_> stan_man_can: you'll probably want to have the "most likely used" option as a default submit button
[13:23:46] <joepie91_> and the alternative option as a regular button that takes some other action
[13:23:57] <joepie91_> you absolutely /have/ to have some kind of default non-JS form submit action
[13:24:39] <stan_man_can> joepie91_:  Alrighty so then I’ll leave the search as a submit button but the export will be a regular button that alters the action path and then submits the form
[13:24:41] <joepie91_> eg. if your options are search or export CSV, you'll probably want search to be a submit button, and export CSV to have some JS attached
[13:24:48] <joepie91_> that would work I suppose
[13:24:56] <joepie91_> that said, multiple submit buttons are almost never the right solution to a problem
[13:25:15] <joepie91_> if your intention is search / export CSV, then you should probably have an export CSV button on the results page rather than the search page
[13:25:27] <joepie91_> since it doesn't really make sense to export data to CSV when you haven't been able to get a look at the data in question first
[13:26:00] <stan_man_can> The results populate beneath the search form
[13:26:06] <stan_man_can> so the search form is always visisble
[13:26:24] <joepie91_> stan_man_can: then there is no reason to have the export CSV button inside the search form, is there?
[13:26:25] <stan_man_can> once the form is submitted and the page reloads I populate the form with the submitted values
[13:26:31] <joepie91_> you can just add it above/below the results
[13:26:37] <joepie91_> as a separate form
[13:26:54] <stan_man_can> yeah but then I have to create two separate forms with identical values
[13:27:01] <joepie91_> that's perfectly okay
[13:27:08] <joepie91_> forms are not an expensive resource :)
[13:27:31] <joepie91_> it's better to stick with something that adheres to the intention between web standards, than to rig something non-standard up
[13:27:36] <joepie91_> especially since the latter won't require JS to function
[13:27:45] <stan_man_can> I guess
[13:27:53] <stan_man_can> given my audence (internal tool at work) this should be okay for a now
[13:27:55] <stan_man_can> audience*
[13:28:02] <stan_man_can> but i certainly get what you’re saying
[13:28:18] <joepie91_> (bonus: having it as separate forms makes maintenance easier later on - easier to add stuff like export options without 'contaminating' the search form)
[13:29:01] <stan_man_can> actually on second thought I hate how this is setup and i’m restarting it
[13:29:24] <joepie91_> :)
[13:29:29] <joepie91_> always good to revisit code!
[13:33:24] <stan_man_can> joepie91_:  good thing too
[13:33:40] <joepie91_> stan_man_can: fwiw, I generally adhere to three different categories of applications in terms of javascript requirement; 1) applications where core functionality requires javascript (using JS is fair game here, even for small things), 2) 'regular' applications/sites (JS is fine for fancy features, but not for core functionality, this is most stuff I work on), and 3) JS-less sites (very rarely, the target audience will largely have JS turned
[13:33:41] <joepie91_> off - in this case I even work on no-JS fallbacks for fancy features)
[13:33:47] <stan_man_can> mentioned it to a co-worker who then told me that they removed that whole requirement
[13:34:29] <joepie91_> eg. if you're targeting darknet users, no-JS is the way to go... if you're building some kind of fancy single-page-application, then JS is fair game... and in most of the cases it's somewhere inbetween, where core functionality should work on pretty much any browser and JS gets you fancy things
[13:34:40] <joepie91_> stan_man_can: ah, neat :D
[13:36:32] <naeluh> hey I need some help with a deferred object or promise I am kinda not getting it totally
[13:37:00] <naeluh> I am putting together a fiddle right now
[13:42:16] <pacmanfan> what's the proper way to run a script on ready?
[13:42:31] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { /* your code here */ });
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> or $(document).ready(function() { /* your code here */ });
[13:42:47] <pacmanfan> i am getting undefined errors
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> they are identical.
[13:42:56] <pacmanfan> but it's fine when i manually run it from console
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> is your code being placed before your jquery include?
[13:43:57] <pacmanfan> ...no, but before the jquery extension include for the extension i'm using
[13:43:58] <pacmanfan> good call
[13:44:10] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[13:44:14] <pacmanfan> thank
[13:44:15] <pacmanfan> s
[13:51:42] <joelteon> hi, I'm getting "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." for an ajax POST request. jquery sends an OPTIONS before the POST and the response I get back has "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" as a header.
[13:51:52] <joelteon> any idea what the problem is?
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> server is munging the responses?
[13:55:04] <joelteon> which? the OPTIONS response or the POST response?
[13:55:09] <joelteon> the second one seems to be getting canceled
[13:55:36] <robertmaxrees> the post?
[13:55:36] <joelteon> here's the options response https://gist.github.com/joelteon/dceeeb13116d04d7ba8f
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> if it's changing that header when you do a post, the server must be changing its response.
[13:56:18] <joelteon> even with POST, the allow origin header is set
[13:56:32] <joelteon> and has the same value
[13:57:36] <joelteon> if the allow origin header on the options request was wrong, would it not try to make a post at all?
[14:00:47] <joelteon> okay, interesting. the logs on the server say the POST is actually getting a 502 back
[14:02:04] <joelteon> that'll be the problem
[14:08:49] <buzzlewo_> are responsive images an HTML5 topic?
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:09:31] <buzzlewo_> thot so..thank you
[14:12:21] <hwamokp66> http://lykeme.com/ can I slow down the fade in and fade out text?
[14:13:21] <robertmaxrees> generally, yeah.
[14:17:19] <hwamokp66> http://lykeme.com/ can I slow down the fade in and fade out text?
[14:17:26] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 i just answered you.
[14:18:02] <robertmaxrees> generally you can.
[14:18:12] <hwamokp66> robermaxrees: haha i meant where do I edit the timer?
[14:18:42] <robertmaxrees> no clue - you're going to have a hard time finding somebody to dig through your JS to figure that part out ;)
[14:18:50] <robertmaxrees> where are you setting up all the animations?
[14:19:45] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: no idea hahaha i got a template and need to slow it down, I'll dig around
[14:20:38] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[14:21:09] <robertmaxrees> generally we ask for a reduced set of code here - http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a good primer for that if you get stuck.
[14:22:03] <_rgn> robertmaxrees that's a good one
[14:22:39] <Poppabear> i have a php server listening for client connections for a simple multiuser chat, i'm pretty new to jquery but i would like to know whats the best way to get the client connected to the server, the server recieves the message and the server then returns the message to all users connected and displays it via the client ? once i get it to that point i can expand on it. thanks for any help in advance
[14:22:56] <robertmaxrees> _rgn i saw it recently and was like "OMFG THAT'S PERFECT"
[14:23:14] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear you're looking for ajax.
[14:23:22] <robertmaxrees> but the push portion is going to be a massive PITA.
[14:23:49] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: can you point me to a decent begginers guide ?
[14:24:11] <Poppabear> keeping best practices in mind :P
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[14:24:27] <robertmaxrees> but the "magic updating" portion is going to give you headaches.
[14:24:30] <_rgn> server listening? websockets?
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll have to regularly poll the server for updates or look into websockets.
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> though websockets aren't supported by older browsers.
[14:25:58] <Poppabear> i seen some information regarding html5 websockets, but what scared me off a bit was the returned data has to be "decoded" to make it readable ?
[14:26:04] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:26:07] <Respek> anyone have experience with skrollr.js? I've been researching it, and was seeking any dissenting opinions. seems pretty great at present
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> get ready to feel uncomfortable.
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> !g simple web-based chat

[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> *bam* ^ google is your best friend.
[14:26:49] <Respek> neat little feature b-ot :)
[14:27:03] <Respek> what's b-ot written in?
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't recall.
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> js iirc
[14:27:20] <joepie91_> Poppabear: warning; you're in for a world of pain when trying to write real-time applications in PHP
[14:27:36] <Respek> hows life treating you robertmaxrees?
[14:27:45] <joepie91_> (just a friendly warning from somebody who has attempted such in the past...)
[14:28:14] <robertmaxrees> Respek pretty awesome actually.  working on my second of two JS presentations, coming up with some good examples and stuff for people to try .
[14:28:25] <robertmaxrees> and I have an oktoberfest thing tomorrow which is goingot be a lot of fun.
[14:28:37] <Respek> awesome! send me the 1st?
[14:28:50] <Respek> you mean tutorial preso's right?
[14:28:52] <robertmaxrees> plus it's friday which means in an hour and a half I get free beer at work.
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean presentations.
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> like, I'm giving them internally to coworkers.
[14:29:11] <Respek> I see :)
[14:29:18] <Respek> using impress.js I love it
[14:29:21] <Respek> *?
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> nah, just basic google slides.
[14:29:50] <Respek> probably faster :) awesome! Have fun!
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> i always do :D
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> how've you been?
[14:30:21] <Poppabear> joepie91_: i am very aware of this, and imo php and jquery do not clash so badly together jquery can simply process a php script and get a response back without ever reloading the page :P
[14:30:35] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear err, jquery can't process php.
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery can request stuff from your server.
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> your server processes the PHP.
[14:30:51] <Respek> great! as you know it's been tough learning functional js, but simple aesthetic stuff has been on my plate all week, and I've been loving it.
[14:31:05] <joepie91_> Poppabear: the problem is on the PHP side, not the jQuery side - PHP is a CGI-type language, and not a (reliably) long-running process
[14:31:15] <joepie91_> so you're going to have an obscene amount of overhead and/or delays
[14:31:23] <joepie91_> it's really just not suitable for real-time applications
[14:31:39] <robertmaxrees> and push-based logic seems like that wouldn't fit very well in there either.
[14:31:40] <joepie91_> you could *theoretically* set up a long-lived process using PHP-CLI but that comes with its own issues and caveats...
[14:32:19] <Poppabear> ok, i could easly write it in TCL or Python ... I perfer TCL as i am much more familiar with it
[14:32:26] <Poppabear> the server anyways
[14:32:49] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear what sort of browser support do you need?
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> or is this just a learning exercise?
[14:34:40] <Respek> thanks for asking :)
[14:34:44] <joepie91_> Poppabear: socket.io (and compatible implementations for other languages, not sure if one exists for TCL) may be worth looking into if you're planning on running stuff in production
[14:34:54] <Poppabear> everything will be built around HTML5 and PHP5+ using the Laravels Framework, And SmartAdmin Bootstrap Template .. Mostly learning, but looking to grow into a open source community project
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear look into socket.io, like joepie91_ suggested.
[14:35:22] <Poppabear> ok
[14:35:24] <Poppabear> thanks
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/rase-/socket.io-php-emitter iiiinteresting
[14:36:23] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: hm. how does that work?
[14:36:34] <robertmaxrees> no clue - I don't do PHP ;)
[14:37:03] <joepie91_> I've done a lot of PHP, and from an initial read it's still not clear to me how it works :P
[14:37:16] <joepie91_> unless I'm misunderstanding something about socket.io emitters
[14:37:27] <joepie91_> afaik a daemon needs to be running for socket.io to work correctly, so this seems a little odd
[14:37:32] <joepie91_> as I can't see any daemonization there anywhere
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> that repo is linked from the 1.0 launch post from the socket.io team.
[14:38:10] <robertmaxrees> http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/
[14:39:44] <joepie91_> robertmaxrees: okay, so what I *think* it's doing, is using Redis as a socket.io server of sorts
[14:39:53] <joepie91_> I'm not really sure on this though
[14:39:58] <robertmaxrees> no clue haha
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> like i said, i don't to PHP
[14:40:02] <joepie91_> and basically just shoving data into Redis
[14:40:05] <joepie91_> and having Redis hand it out
[14:40:13] <joepie91_> (to clients)
[14:40:30] <joepie91_> that's curious.
[14:41:06] <joepie91_> I'm not entirely convinced that that's a good idea, but it's still interesting
[14:41:22] <robertmaxrees> lol either way, let's at least get back to being kind of on topic :)
[14:41:58] <joepie91_> :)
[14:42:29] * joepie91_ should probably get back to code anyway...
[14:42:55] <jy_> robertmaxrees!
[14:43:17] <robertmaxrees> wuddup
[14:43:18] <jy_> I finally discovered why I was having problems with my css
[14:43:30] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[14:43:41] <jy_> my files had different encodings that didn't match
[14:43:58] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha niiiiiice
[14:44:30] <jy_> I'm just now finding out that half of the files are ANSI and the other half is UTF-8
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> D: ouch.
[14:45:33] <jy_> the encoding of my php files affects the inputs they get from the user right?
[14:45:45] <jy_> with string manipulation and such?
[14:45:46] <jiffe> when I call $('#id'), what type of object does that return exactly?
[14:45:57] <robertmaxrees> jy_ no clue.  i don't do PHP.
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> jiffe a jquery object.
[14:46:10] <jy_> blarg
[14:47:00] <jy_> I'm basically re-working a whole system because it couldn't handle some of the less common characters like 
[14:51:34] <Poppabear> seems like there is to many Dependencies to mess with socket.io ... its dependent on nodejs
[14:53:13] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/rase-/socket.io-php-emitter
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> doesn't require node.
[14:57:03] <Poppabear> hmm
[14:57:07] <Poppabear> interesting
[15:40:54] <brettfrable> Hey all - I was recently laid off. I'm a pretty good front end dev. If anyone knows anyone that needs some freelance work or will hire full time remotely, please have them contact me at bfrable@gmail.com
[16:03:16] <ChrisBinge_> I have written some jQuery that calculates an images aspect ratio, loads image to fit container, and on resize adjusts the image.. This all works most of the time. The issue is, it is a little glitchy on load sometime, has anyone had similar issue with images?
[17:26:12] <introspectr3> https://dpaste.de/MFGC how would i access the data-value of the selected span inside of ratings?

[20:02:01] <prawnosun> Hi guys :)
[20:03:25] <prawnosun> is there a way to find out the position on elements that are matched?
[20:04:01] <prawnosun> for instance $('.foo'); and I have 5 <div class="foo">
[20:04:28] <prawnosun> can i retrieve the index for the 3rd div?
[20:29:37] <prawnosun> how to append at a particular index?
