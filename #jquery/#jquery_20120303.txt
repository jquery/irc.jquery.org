[00:00:28] <jrockjiggz> donCams: object expected means you are utilizing an identifier that has not been defined or declared.  IE calling a function that doesn't exist or hasn't loaded yet
[00:02:09] <jrockjiggz> donCams: it could be your external script tag, change type="application/javascript" to type="text/javascript" would fix it

[03:59:56] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[04:01:02] <fof> Nece228: there are a few tutorials for that if you look on google
[04:01:33] <fof> eg http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/dd/dnd2.php
[04:01:45] <aqeel> if i click li from main menu it loads relative li into submenu....now if i hover over any other li in main menu .....i want on mouse out to show the li content of submenu wich was called on click li in main menu
[04:04:49] <Aiden> http://puu.sh/9J8n god damnit....
[04:05:37] <aqeel> like if i hover over the li after having the li clicked .....it must look for the class 'loaded'...within the entire ul to see if indeed it does then load the entire relative of that chucnk....
[04:11:47] <puppen> heeeya, wondering if jquery has any kind of json-encoding inbuilt.. like JSON.stringify, but more old-browser-friendly?.. or should i just stick with using JSON if it's available?
[04:12:16] <puppen> its not totally important - in-house project which will most likely only be accessed with Chrome.. just wondering is all..
[04:12:48] <caddoo> does $(this).change fire when you change an elements value via jQuery
[04:12:52] <caddoo> or rather is it supposed to
[04:13:31] <dabear> caddoo: it does not and is not supposed to either
[04:13:39] <caddoo> ok thanks
[04:14:36] <batty> I'm trying to build a jq menu but am having problems with my hover events :/ the animation only occurs when I go in AND out of the item. Can anyone explain to me why? http://jsbin.com/asatex/2/edit#javascript,html
[04:14:40] <SoulRaven> anyone has any ideea way i can't trigger an action using defferer multiple times?
[04:17:15] <dabear> SoulRaven: does not compute
[04:17:39] <SoulRaven> dabear: i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/whnjT/3/
[04:17:59] <SoulRaven> and i get .done ony one time
[04:18:30] <SoulRaven> when i dblclick the .resolve() i get the first time .done
[04:18:36] <dabear> yes
[04:18:53] <dabear> that is how deferreds work
[04:19:03] <dabear> they should only resolve once
[04:19:07] <SoulRaven> way? any ideea how i do to make each time to trigger .done()
[04:19:17] <dabear> no
[04:19:57] <caddoo> dabear: referring to my previous question, is there then a way to call an elements change events with JS
[04:20:19] <caddoo> so basically make it perform the expected behaviour
[04:20:20] <dabear> SoulRaven: when deferreds get resolved, they stay resolved.
[04:20:26] <chris_w> is there anything, -anything- more reliable that Ripple to emulate mobile web / phonegap on linux?  this thing is busting my balls.
[04:20:46] <dabear> ?trigger @ caddoo
[04:21:07] <dabear> caddoo: look at the docs, search for trigger or triggerhandler
[04:21:16] <SoulRaven> dabear: and i can't recycle the deferred for future use?
[04:21:59] <dabear> SoulRaven: deferreds stay resolved, that's the whole point
[04:22:35] <dabear> you can add more .done handlers and they will fire right away, but my guess is that you want a callback, not a deferred
[04:23:12] <SoulRaven> i want to call multiple times whne same method
[04:23:22] <SoulRaven> to get a callback from ajax
[04:23:25] <dabear> ->callback
[04:23:35] <aqeel> how to search for a specific class say 'loaded' in the ul li tree and take its id remove # add . and call it......thus making the id into class
[04:24:39] <dabear> aqeel: look at these methods: find, attr
[04:25:16] <aqeel> thanks...

[04:44:21] <nFFF> put it first in the file? :<
[04:44:22] <caddoo> ill just use document.ready it actually provides the right order for me luckily
[04:44:35] <caddoo> procedural
[04:45:00] <nFFF> document.ready waits until the document is ready before your code is run
[04:45:18] <caddoo> yes it also seems to wait for other JS that isn't in document.ready to finish

[04:48:52] <sravan_> results[i] contains external urls.  For some reason, its prepending the current page location to that external link
[04:50:00] <sravan_> for example...  http://www.1111.com/test/http://exterallink.com/list/1 is the value that gets assigned to 'a' where as I expect it to be http://externallink.com/list/1
[04:51:29] <batty> :(

[04:51:43] <Pooky5> http://jsfiddle.net/gMFCF/2/
[04:51:54] <Pooky5> it's look very silly, but I can't figured this out
[04:52:35] <batty> pooky: .find("#sub") is wrong
[04:52:58] <sravan_> batty can you help me?
[04:53:26] <Pooky5> batty: did we watch the same? http://jsfiddle.net/gMFCF/3/
[04:53:28] <batty> you can just pull id's you don't need to find them. and it doesn't match the markup. what are you trying to do?
[04:55:08] <nFFF> :>
[04:58:00] <Pooky5> I meaby missunderstand pricnipe of javascript loop
[04:58:09] <Pooky5> but it really confused me
[04:58:34] <batty> weird! its not finding the item
[04:59:05] <nFFF> your i is never going to be 1 wihin your bind
[04:59:13] <nFFF> you need to approach this a differen way I feel
[04:59:14] <sravan_> batty: can you help me?
[04:59:19] <aqeel> ok guys if i click something ...how can i and what would be the best way to keep track of that click.....so later on it can be recalled.....id/class can be used?
[04:59:20] <nFFF> use classes not id's for this
[05:00:24] <batty> Pooky, the evnt is being called after the loop so i is 1
[05:00:33] <Pooky5> Well, I found it - this is solution - http://jsfiddle.net/d3GNS/
[05:00:56] <nFFF> lol :>
[05:02:18] <Pooky5> simple
[05:02:22] <aqeel> ok guys if i click something ...how can i and what would be the best way to keep track of that click.....so later on it can be recalled.....id/class can be used?
[05:04:33] <Pooky5> aqeel: how you mean it?
[05:05:11] <aqeel> yes/
[05:05:59] <csarmi> I really don't know, but giving that something a class named 'clicked' sounds like a straightforward idea
[05:06:30] <nFFF> Pooky5
[05:06:32] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/d3GNS/1/
[05:06:37] <nFFF> This is more elegant solution imo
[05:07:03] <chuwiey> if i'm making a progress bar, and it's based on a server side script, how do i advance "progress" from the server side?
[05:07:10] <aqeel> well if i click an li with class/id......i want that to be kept with say some var....and when i hover over other li and when mouse out must call that var
[05:07:29] <sravan_> I have a simple javascript  where  I am doing a.href=results[i].url; [04:48] <sravan_> results[i] contains external urls.  For some reason, its prepending the current page location to that external link
[05:07:36] <sravan_> for example...  http://www.1111.com/test/http://exterallink.com/list/1 is the value that gets assigned to 'a' where as I expect it to be http://externallink.com/list/1
[05:08:00] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[05:08:47] <aqeel> if u click 1 in main menu...now hover over li 2,3, ...........now if u mouse out see the contents changed...
[05:08:48] <caddoo> Does everyone here still code websites so they function perfectly and users don't miss content when JS is turned off?
[05:08:54] <caddoo> or anyone for that matter
[05:09:59] <nFFF> sravan_
[05:10:06] <nFFF> window.location.href
[05:12:17] <sravan_> nFFF: I am doing a.href= url but its preprending  base url of the page
[05:12:22] <sravan_> really confused
[05:12:32] <csarmi> aqeel
[05:12:37] <aqeel> yes
[05:12:39] <sahbeewah> are you sure you have http in there
[05:13:05] <csarmi> isn't it possible to keep that class/variable on the frame that contains your li's?
[05:13:08] <chuwiey> if i'm making a progress bar, and it's based on a server side script, how do i advance "progress" from the server side?
[05:13:30] <sahbeewah> or is it more like http://www.111.com/test/www.eternallink.com/list/1
[05:13:37] <csarmi> so in this cause, probably the <ul> tag or whatever contains that should have information on which menu is active?
[05:13:51] <sravan_> sahbeewah: its has the http:// in the ext url
[05:14:14] <csarmi> or isn't that what you mean? to know which <li> was clicked last?
[05:15:25] <aqeel> but i am calling the li individually......#link1 calls .link1.....upto....#link5 calls .link5.....but now one is claiked.....so how can i make it statis so that nomatter if i hover over nonclicked will rveal clicked on mouse out
[05:15:39] <csarmi> then again, I'm not really experienced in js or jquery that's just what my feeling is
[05:16:02] <pen> e.dataTransfer is undefined
[05:16:08] <pen> I thought 1.7 fixed it?

[05:16:19] <angelazou> I have a list of social sites that are too long
[05:16:33] <angelazou> I want to first show only 8 items and a more link
[05:16:51] <angelazou> when clicking on the more link it would reveal the rest of the sites
[05:17:22] <csarmi> so if you click on link1
[05:17:33] <csarmi> then mouse over link2, it should show the mebnu for link2
[05:17:38] <pen> or is there other ways to access dataTransfer?
[05:17:42] <pen> are
[05:17:44] <csarmi> if you mouse out from link 2, it should show link1 again
[05:17:53] <aqeel> yessssssssssssssssss
[05:17:56] <csarmi> is that it?
[05:18:13] <angelazou> not really, I put together a simple demo here
[05:18:40] <angelazou> here is an updated version http://jsfiddle.net/Yspdz/3/
[05:18:57] <angelazou> i think the user would prefer clicking
[05:18:57] <csarmi> so my idea was this: when you click link1, yu give this <ul id="mainmenucontentul"> a class named link1
[05:19:27] <angelazou> I was thinking something along the line of
[05:19:30] <aqeel> well everything is working fine......but now o mouse out it must remember the click state
[05:19:40] <angelazou> add a class to all the sites I want to hide initially
[05:19:44] <csarmi> and when yu mouse out from link2, you check the class of your <ul>
[05:19:53] <angelazou> and when that more link is clicked
[05:20:00] <angelazou> populate them
[05:20:01] <aqeel> that is what i want to do but how
[05:20:02] <csarmi> and based on that, yu 'click' link1
[05:20:24] <angelazou> it's okay, but I'm worried about the slidetoggle won't work for that second click
[05:20:29] <csarmi> i dunno, must be some addclass, removeclass, match class
[05:20:57] <aqeel> i have one class 'loaded' within that entire ul.....after li is clikced this class is added dynamically now how to get the state on mouse out..
[05:21:34] <aqeel> and it is now just only class....
[05:22:04] <aqeel> but must grab the id of that li as well and load the relative link ....
[05:22:10] <csarmi> aqeel: I can't help you with the exact technival details, I'm not that good
[05:22:20] <aqeel> thanks for you rtime...
[05:22:27] <aqeel> your time*
[05:22:32] <csarmi> it's just what sounds reasonable to me from a programmer's poijt of vview
[05:22:43] <csarmi> I'm pretty sure someone here must be able to, however
[05:23:07] <csarmi> I also think that yur example site/code is quite readable so they should be able to help
[05:23:36] <aqeel> thanks for your complement...
[05:24:35] <csarmi> what you might be missing here is how to check if an item has a given class?
[05:25:44] <aqeel> well yes and also much more...
[05:25:57] <aqeel> i can use find to lookup for the class...
[05:27:02] <pen> e.dataTransfer is undefined
[05:27:18] <pen> it seems like a bug and the solution does not work
[05:27:27] <pen> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/6AXjU/
[05:27:33] <pen> doesn't work
[05:29:03] <pen> oh, nvm, I need to add hooks for other events too
[05:37:42] <csarmi> aqeel: find won't be enough?
[05:43:05] <aqeel> yes i know.....am working on it.....find the class loaded them grab its id and have its relative sub meny shown
[05:43:19] <aqeel> menu*
[05:56:58] <fotoflo> any jquery-ui folks here?
[05:59:13] <fotoflo> i have a $("#container").dialog()  and when i do that its appending some ID-less div's to the page - how do i create a direct decendant of that new div? (i want to position: absolute; relative to that window that is being created)
[06:04:18] <aqeel> $("#mainmenucontent li").find("loaded")
[06:04:25] <aqeel> ok this is for finding
[06:04:30] <chris_w> Anyone in here hacked PhotoSwipe much?  I need to find where it's binding things to 'swipeleft'
[06:04:33] <aqeel> now how to attach id to it?
[06:07:46] <chris_w> aqeel, .attr() maybe?
[06:07:59] <chris_w> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:08:23] <chris_w> that should allow you set id's
[06:11:29] <aqeel> thanks
[06:17:47] <S1kx> since I updated jquery mobile to 1.0.1, I always get the content replaced with "undefined" if I open a page that is still cached (returns 304 Not Modified). is this a known bug/problem?
[06:20:54] <Whirl3d> hey all. I have a collection of elements that all have one class in common and one class that's unique to that element. I need to create an object where the unique class becomes the attribute name and the element is it's value. Basicaly  <p class='msg error'>foo</p><p class='msg instr'>bar</p>  would become {error:$("p.msg.error"), instr:$("p.msg.instr")}
[06:21:04] <Whirl3d> any suggestions on the best way to do it?
[06:26:05] <S1kx> nvm about my problem, I got it... had layout disabled in rails for xhr ;)
[06:36:37] <Whirl3d> if I have an array of objects that I want to combine into a single object, when I use $.extend({},list); I get an object with numeric attributes that represent the original elements...any suggestions?
[06:36:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/zNnJB/3/
[06:45:51] <pen> I have a jquery object which matches with a selector, and I have another jquery object which maps to a single DOM, how do I do in jquery to find if this jquery object is inside the jquery list?
[06:51:11] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/TyMe8/
[06:51:29] <aqeel> everything is  A OK................but i need the code in for loop
[06:51:47] <aqeel> between the comments................
[06:52:15] <RandalSchwartz> why a loop
[06:52:22] <aqeel> multi lines?
[06:52:26] <RandalSchwartz> just look for everyone that has a loaded class
[06:52:51] <RandalSchwartz> if you learn to use the jq searching functions, you'll stop looping
[06:53:19] <aqeel> i am new at it...rather braining up...as long time didi not use it
[06:53:25] <RandalSchwartz> we were trying to tell you this 12 hours ago
[06:53:44] <aqeel> i know....i am working at it
[06:53:50] <RandalSchwartz> $('#topnode .loaded')
[06:53:55] <aqeel> but could not quite get to the point
[06:54:05] <RandalSchwartz> that's all nodes below #topnode that have the class .loaded
[06:54:06] <RandalSchwartz> as a set
[06:54:09] <RandalSchwartz> then you can do things to that set
[06:54:35] <RandalSchwartz> $('#topnode .loaded').removeClass('loaded')
[06:54:44] <aqeel> but i need to test against individual id....
[06:54:48] <RandalSchwartz> why?
[06:54:55] <aqeel> se my code?
[06:54:59] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[06:55:00] <RandalSchwartz> why
[06:55:05] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/TyMe8/
[06:55:05] <RandalSchwartz> your code doesn't explain why
[06:55:10] <RandalSchwartz> YES I SEE THAT
[06:55:11] <RandalSchwartz> why
[06:55:27] <RandalSchwartz> do you just want to remove the class from any of those nodes that has the class?
[06:56:02] <RandalSchwartz> oops - got something urgent here
[06:56:07] <RandalSchwartz> but please learn not to loop
[06:56:11] <RandalSchwartz> just use classes and broad expressions
[06:56:14] <RandalSchwartz> life will be easier
[06:56:32] * RandalSchwartz wanders off
[06:56:49] <aqeel> loading my site.....
[06:57:08] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[06:58:11] <aqeel> agree but at some point u still need to be put into loop
[06:58:25] <Whirl3d> RandalSchwartz, can you help me with the jquery map function?
[07:05:36] <Whirl3d> wow, it's weird that this channel is so quiet...
[07:11:38] <fof> some lucky ones dont have to work on saturday
[07:11:59] <Whirl3d> work?
[07:12:26] <fof> most activity in here seems to come from people struggling with work tasks :p
[07:12:38] <fof> a lot, at least
[07:14:52] <RandalSchwartz> I'm working today
[07:14:56] <RandalSchwartz> like every day
[07:15:02] <RandalSchwartz> welcome to being a small business owner. :)
[07:15:18] <fof> 6 days then usually something on sundays...
[07:15:55] <Whirl3d> I know there is an easier way to do what I am trying to do here. I want to remove 3 paragraph elements in a li and put their html() content into the li data object.
[07:16:51] <Whirl3d> Then when "activated", I use the class of the li to determine which html() string to append to a floating panel for help
[07:22:16] <fof> rather than data object you could store help in html files with id/class conventions and grab stuff from it as you need maybe
[07:23:40] <LucaS05> hi
[07:24:46] <LucaS05> i've two file starting with document ready but it seems that what i write in the second file is not executed (in fact i put there an alert mesage) what's the problem?
[07:26:43] <fof> on the page you're loading jquery then the two script files after that?
[07:27:37] <LucaS05> sure ;)
[07:28:01] <LucaS05> maybe an error?
[07:28:18] <LucaS05> an error in the code i've written
[07:28:20] <Mazi> Hey folks, does anybody know if it is possible to have some JS on a HTML page that "drops" an arrow from top of the page to a certain page element, in this case the arrow should point to the magnifying glass at http://www.marksim.org/de/software/ to indicate that the magnifying glass can be moved.
[07:28:31] <Mazi> Any ideas or alternative solutions?
[07:29:18] <LucaS05> fof as i tought it was an error!
[07:29:25] <LucaS05> thanks anyway ;)
[07:29:56] <fof> yeah that was other possibility
[07:30:29] <LucaS05> but the error is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[07:30:51] <fof> are you wrapping the element with $()?
[07:30:55] <LucaS05> cause it reads the length of an element that there isn't on the page
[07:31:53] <LucaS05> mmm it isn't possible to do a thing like this .val().length right?
[07:36:17] <fof> Mazi: there must be a less intrusive way for user to know the magnifier can move, maybe hide it, move hide/show magnifier button to top of image, then they will know what's happening when it's on screen
[07:36:52] <Whirl3d> fof, less intrusive?
[07:37:47] <Trav19842> Hey guys, is anyone able to give me a hand with some code I wrote? I can paste the link =)
[07:37:48] <fof> ?
[07:38:03] <Whirl3d> Mazi, if you want to animate an arrow image that starts at the top of the screen and drops to the magnifier, just use .animate...it will do what you want.
[07:39:47] <Whirl3d> $("img.arrowClass").css({top:-100, left:50%}).animate({top:$("#magnifier").offset()["top"]},300);....
[07:43:07] <Trav19842> Here is the link if anyone is able to give me some tips, i'm trying to display the contents of the xml file with a hover event but can't seem to get it --> http://jsbin.com/anodin/edit
[07:43:34] <fof> Whirl3d: i meant the page shouldnt need an animated arrow pointing to it
[07:45:29] <Whirl3d> See, I don't really feel like that's my position to be telling people how to design shit. They didn't come here asking for help with their design, they ask for help with their jquery. Design is so subjective and user interface is as well. So even though I agree with you, I kind of think it's rude to tell someone how to design their content when they ask for help with coding.
[07:45:56] <Whirl3d> if that sounded bitchy, I didn't mean it. It's just my peev, I'm sure
[07:47:52] <Whirl3d> It's a weird morning this morning. Usually a whole bunch of folks wanna chime in with their opinion by now. And I expect at least one sarcastic comment from coldhead or someone... lol
[07:48:31] <Trav19842> makes sense to me whirl3s :P
[07:49:17] <Mazi> Whirl3d, thanks a lot, will test this. is there some demo of the .animate feature??
[07:49:55] <Whirl3d> ?.animate@Mazi
[07:50:06] <Whirl3d> doh! Even bot-T sleeps.
[07:50:20] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/animate
[07:50:47] <Mazi> thanks, have a great day!
[07:51:26] <Whirl3d> Trav19842, I have never parsed xml with jquery, so I am not much help there.
[07:52:36] <Trav19842> no probs, thanks anyway! just wishing i wasn't such a javascript noob haha
[07:56:06] <poppiez> in what browsers are the "progress" event supported in browsers?
[07:56:49] <chuwiey> can anyone please help me with this: http://pastebin.com/aJxHj4R8 -- nothing happens when I click my like/unlike links. (It was working a few minutes ago, but I have no idea what changed)
[07:56:50] <Whirl3d> I'm usually the last person to refer someone to google, but that really does sound like a generic question for google rather than a jquery question.
[07:57:15] <Whirl3d> chuwiey, looking...
[07:57:39] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: thanks
[07:59:28] <Whirl3d> chuwiey, have you ever used jsfiddle? It might be easier to see what's going on there
[08:00:43] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: never used it... i'll take a look. thanks :)
[08:00:44] <Whirl3d> do you have a single like and unlike button in your entire page?
[08:00:55] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: no, many of them...
[08:01:05] <Whirl3d> Then you can't use the same ID for each one
[08:01:19] <Whirl3d> $("#like") can only ever find one single element
[08:01:26] <Whirl3d> use a class instead...
[08:01:40] <Whirl3d> $(".likeButton").....   would return all like buttons
[08:02:22] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: ahh... i didn't know that...
[08:02:43] <RandalSchwartz> id's are so shiny of an object... people get obsessed with them. :)
[08:03:31] <chuwiey> RandalSchwartz: :-)
[08:03:44] <Whirl3d> Yeah. It gets rough when you read that ID's are the fastest selectors for item, so you think, "aha I I'll ID everything"..
[08:04:25] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: yup, that fixed it... now for the second problem (same script). the stuff I put in success doesn't work...
[08:04:36] <kzoo> is $(element).parent().parent() the same as $(element).offsetParent() ?
[08:04:54] <Whirl3d> the success callback function receives the result of the callback (plus some other stuff)
[08:05:30] <Whirl3d> so if your script that you are accessing via ajax returns a "0" then you can kind of make sense of your callback.
[08:05:43] <poppiez> why isn't "upload" exposed in ajax? I need to do some upload progress
[08:06:09] <Whirl3d> but I would still do something like: success:function (data) { var count=parseInt(data); if (count===0) {....
[08:07:07] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: I return either 0 or a different number...
[08:07:22] <Whirl3d> but I think the data returned is going to be text
[08:07:43] <chuwiey> that's why i check for != false... as long as it isn't false, then I know to continue working?
[08:08:19] <Whirl3d> I don't see the !=false;
[08:08:32] <Whirl3d> and perhaps you should use a different name for the parameter
[08:08:56] <Whirl3d> success:function (param)   instead of success:function (success) { ...which success am I checking now....
[08:10:28] <jarlath> Could someone please put me out of my misery and explain why my function resizes the image but not the text? I'm using the same syntax for both. http://pastebin.com/RTZQzVxj
[08:10:39] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: you're right. thanks!
[08:11:59] <Whirl3d> if you look at .ajax in the api, you can set the return data type using the data-type attrib. But "number" or "decimal" or the like aren't listed.
[08:13:42] <Whirl3d> jarlath, try using camel case for your css attributes instead of hyphens...that might help
[08:13:42] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: I basically want a boolean check there... i return true/false from php.. what's the best way?
[08:14:38] <Whirl3d> can you change the php to return the string literal "true" or "false"?
[08:14:48] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: sure...
[08:14:51] <Whirl3d> then if (data=="true") { ...
[08:15:03] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: okay.. thanks. :)
[08:15:11] <Whirl3d> set your data-type to 'text' and try it.
[08:15:48] <Whirl3d> jarlath, like $("h1").css("fontSize",30);
[08:19:21] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: okay, the success check works... but it doesn't seem to be calling the functions within it...
[08:20:17] <chuwiey> i should note that i've also changed the $('#item_box') to a class check since i have multiples of those as well
[08:21:12] <Whirl3d> great! good call.
[08:22:03] <Whirl3d> I tend to stay away from using selectors in the parent() selector method.
[08:22:05] <poppiez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10190 - anyone know how to get the upload value temporarily while this gets fixed?
[08:23:34] <Whirl3d> In other words,$link.parent() should only use a selector inside if there's a chance that $link's parents are changing classes so it can fail...I'm not explaining this well...
[08:24:41] <Whirl3d> It seems like I just use $link.closest(".item_box"); which will also select the parent element if it's of class item_box...
[08:25:03] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: i understand... okay.. :) thanks!
[08:25:43] <Whirl3d> change your success handler to log the value of $link when it is returned.
[08:26:49] <Whirl3d> another thing you may want to consider is this: if you have multiple containers that have "like" and "unlike" buttons inside of them, it may be in your best interest to use .on
[08:27:53] <chuwiey> instead of bind?
[08:28:05] <Whirl3d> in their common ancestor, handle the "click" event using .on $("ancestor").on("click",".likeButton", function (e) {do like button things});
[08:28:36] <Whirl3d> then, you don't have to bind/unbind every time you either a) change button states from like to unlike or b) add more like buttons or unlike buttons.
[08:28:59] <Whirl3d> they all get handled by the one function, making it faster, easier to troubleshoot, etc.
[08:29:45] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: so then if inside ancestor there is a .unlikeButton, it will get handled by the correct function?
[08:29:47] <Whirl3d> So you would be shifting the responsibility of the click handler from having to be defined on every button, to the one click handler that handles them all consistently.
[08:29:55] <Whirl3d> right
[08:30:11] <Whirl3d> and even if you toggle the class of a button from like to unlike, it will handle it correctly
[08:30:15] <chuwiey> and I owuld define that as a .on for every ancestor with a specific class?
[08:30:27] <chuwiey> * would
[08:31:10] <chuwiey> great help! thanks Whirl3d :)
[08:31:14] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure how your html is configured, but lets say you have a collection of images with like/unlike buttons below them. The entire collection of images resides in a "imagePage" div,
[08:31:17] <chuwiey> you've been very helpful
[08:31:24] <Whirl3d> then use .on on the imagePage element
[08:32:19] <chuwiey> i have a ul#items and li.item (a collection of items). each .item has a like button if it hasn't been liked and a .unlike button if it has..
[08:32:35] <chuwiey> so I would be setting this on li.item or on ul#items?
[08:33:24] <Whirl3d> ul.on("click",".likeButton", function (e) {var btn=$(e.target); var item=btn.closest('.item"); do stuff});
[08:33:53] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: great, thanks! :)
[08:33:57] <Whirl3d> np.
[08:34:29] <chuwiey> getting to work on it...
[08:34:44] <Whirl3d> this will work better for utilitizing the dialog box as well. one handler will ensure that you only have one element calling on your dialog box...
[08:35:16] <kzoo> anyone know how to work around "Permission denied to access property 'document'". im loading a popup window from another another and need to modify certain elements of the window
[08:35:39] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: how do you mean? Don't I call the dialog box with one element now as well?
[08:36:17] <Whirl3d> but every unlike button calls it
[08:36:31] <Whirl3d> instead of the one ul calling it
[08:36:41] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: ahh... gotcha :)
[08:36:51] <Whirl3d> so if I like/unlike 3 things right away, it's gonna get weird
[08:37:10] <chuwiey> I wish there was some reference to correct js architecture...
[08:37:46] <Whirl3d> I wish evilTwin was here...or Cork. Look for those folks. They are REALLY helpful and they know their shit.
[08:38:19] <chuwiey> Whirl3d: thanks... will look for them...
[08:38:24] <Whirl3d> They can also pull about a million really great references outta there asses at a second's notice.
[08:38:47] <Whirl3d> Have a good one. If you make millions, make sure to send some my way...just kidding
[08:38:56] <chuwiey> :)
[08:38:59] <chuwiey> thanks a lot
[08:39:04] <chuwiey> been a big help, you have
[08:39:58] <Whirl3d> 8)
[08:45:22] <jarlath> Thanks Whirl3d, I'll give it a try.
[08:57:33] <jarlath> Whirl3d, that didn't work for me. I've noticed a diffence in syntax between css, js and jquery. I'm not even sure what I'm using in that example! Any ideas? $("h1").css("textSize", 10); did nothing on window resize even though the image was updated.
[08:58:50] <jarlath> The syntax here is different again: http://www.shopdev.co.uk/blog/text-resizing-with-jquery/. I'm very confused.
[09:16:57] <crankharder> when an arrow key is pressed, how do I prevent the window from moving?
[09:17:08] <crankharder> i've tried keypress/stopPropagation, fail
[09:17:20] <eddiemonge> jarlath: fontSize
[09:19:02] <eddiemonge> jarlath: and thats a not great example to use
[09:19:28] <eddiemonge> crankharder: arrow up and down? bind to keydown
[09:19:46] <jarlath> eddiemonge, it's actually the code for my website LOL.
[09:20:56] <eddiemonge> thats your example?
[09:23:01] <jarlath> eddiemonge, I want to put this live when I get the font resize working. I've used fontSize now but it still doesn't work. Am I using the right <script> type? http://pastebin.com/ZgW5DhbY
[09:23:50] <jarlath> Eddiemonge, the image resize isn't my code. But it works and I'm trying to get the text resize to work with the same syntax.
[09:23:54] <eddiemonge> attr should be css
[09:24:09] <eddiemonge> and use jsfiddle
[09:25:26] <jarlath> eddiemonge, the attr part is woring. The image is resizing correctly. It's the css that isn't working..
[09:26:02] <eddiemonge> attr is working with the margin?
[09:26:22] <jarlath> No, the image width.
[09:26:37] <jarlath> I've updated the code: http://pastebin.com/ZgW5DhbY
[09:28:28] <eddiemonge> why are you automatically resizing the image to 80%? why not set it to that?
[09:29:43] <jarlath> I thought that was necessary to handle window resizes?
[09:30:30] <LukeNukem> Hello
[09:31:00] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/hYGfh/1/
[09:35:32] <jarlath> thanks eddiemonge, and I've just popped the 80% in the css and it holds across window resizes... spent 24 hours on that (I'm just beginning).
[09:36:05] <eddiemonge> css is usually the better solution
[09:37:17] <jarlath> Okay, I'll start there. The code you posted doesn't work for me - do I need to use the jfiddle library with it?
[09:38:18] <nsanden> hello, i'm trying to figure out how to use a sortable/draggable and cancel the drag/sort on receive - any pointers? - http://jsfiddle.net/3EYFh/28/
[09:41:49] <jarlath> eddiemonge, thank you.
[09:48:56] <JackBauer24> nsanden: you want to disable drag&sort completely after moving 1 item?
[09:49:34] <nsanden> JackBauer24: No, i want it as if i hadn't even dragged it over in the first place
[09:52:16] <JackBauer24> nsanden: I think you have to manually read the initial data, store it and set it when needed
[09:52:59] <nsanden> JackBauer24: Of list 2?
[09:53:53] <nsanden> That seems like a lot of work
[09:54:01] <JackBauer24> nsanden: yes, unless list 1 will be dynamic too, then you have to store it too
[09:54:52] <nsanden> My ultimate goal is i want to be able to drag items from list 1 over to list 2 and have the item i dragged formatted the same way as the items in list 2
[09:55:24] <nsanden> list 1 might look quite a bit different than list 2
[09:57:04] <JackBauer24> nsanden: I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if understand what you mean. You mean CSS formatting, order or what?
[09:57:17] <nsanden> JackBauer24: CSS formatting yes
[09:57:28] <nsanden> JackBauer24: and even html
[09:59:42] <JackBauer24> nsanden: ok, you just need to add one CSS rule: http://jsfiddle.net/3EYFh/30/
[10:01:57] <nsanden> JackBauer24: Thanks, please see http://jsfiddle.net/3EYFh/31/ - if all items in list 2 have that trash icon, how do i give the new items i drag over that icon as well?
[10:03:30] <nsanden> JackBauer24: seems like there should be a hook into whatever i just dragged over
[10:03:44] <nsanden> and i can then manipulate that html
[10:05:25] <Pat> hi
[10:05:46] <Pat> is someone german speaking here?
[10:07:21] <Wulf> Pat: yes, you are.
[10:08:45] <Pat> :D
[10:09:24] <JackBauer24> nsanden: use "$(this).data().sortable.currentItem" as a handler to dropped item inside of receive event
[10:09:38] <JackBauer24> and then just append some HTML
[10:10:24] <nsanden> JackBauer24: Yes! Thanks, works great
[10:10:28] <Pat> I've got a problem. i am new to jquery. I've got a html page with a menu and a content area. i want to overwrite the content area with html-content from an external html-file. is this possible?
[10:11:22] <Pat> when i click a link in the navigation, the the new html-content should be loading
[10:12:25] <JackBauer24> Pat: only through ajax
[10:12:52] <Pat> i can show you my code
[10:13:06] <Pat> i made it with ajax
[10:13:14] <Pat> but doesn't work
[10:15:03] <Pat> http://nopaste.info/8363c21a2e.html
[10:15:45] <ravenzz> Pat http://pjax.heroku.com/
[10:18:53] <Pat> i've got a video tutorial which is like my code. but it doesn't work for me
[10:19:39] <ngharo> Pat: $(this).attr("hash") should be .attr("href")
[10:21:44] <Pat> doesn't work =/
[10:22:06] <Pat> var hash = $(this).attr("href");  ?
[10:22:22] <PressedWeb> Hey guys, how can I traverse and fetch a class-less grandparent element?
[10:22:42] <PressedWeb> Is there a way to do .parents[1] or something?
[10:22:47] <ngharo> ?closest @ PressedWeb
[10:22:58] <ravenzz> Pat your website should work if js is disabled btw
[10:23:16] <ravenzz> you should take a look at the pjax script
[10:23:16] <ngharo> Pat: use console.log() to see if you've got the right values
[10:24:01] <Pat> ok i will take a look
[10:24:04] <PressedWeb> ngharo: I'd love to use closest() but there is a similar class-less element in between point A and point B
[10:24:39] <PressedWeb> <ul> <li> <ul> <li class="current"> Hello </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
[10:25:02] <PressedWeb> So how could I traverse from .current to the first <ul>?
[10:25:13] <PressedWeb> I think this might work: $(this).ancestors().eq(2);
[10:27:05] <PressedWeb> Hm. Doesn't seem ancestors exists. parents works though. Thanks for letting me bat ideas around. ;)
[10:31:08] <nFFF> PressedWeb, the first <ul> of the page
[10:31:12] <nFFF> or first parent?
[10:32:37] <ravenzz> PressedWeb $('.current').parents('ul').eq(1) ?
[10:34:33] <nFFF> if you know hwo many parents away it is
[10:35:54] <ravenzz> var foo = $('.current').parents('ul'); foo.eq(foo.length-1)
[10:36:42] <nFFF> var cur = $('.current').parents('ul'); $(cur[cur.length-1]).append('hai');?
[10:36:45] <ravenzz> or last
[10:36:45] <ravenzz> :?
[10:37:19] <nFFF> yea same solution :D
[10:37:35] <ravenzz> yep last is the one
[10:40:43] <PressedWeb> nFFF, ravenzz: This worked: $this.parents().eq(4)
[10:40:50] <ravenzz> \m/ >_< \m/
[10:41:01] <ravenzz> PressedWeb $('.current').parents('ul').last()
[10:41:01] <PressedWeb> :)
[10:41:16] <PressedWeb> It's nested prrrretty deep. :)
[10:42:25] <PressedWeb> I've got a new question though. How do I fetch a single class attr from an element that has several? For instance, if I have <div class="foo bar moo">, how could I fetch the 2nd class name?
[10:43:08] <PressedWeb> Ah, I can use split, nm
[10:43:27] <ravenzz> what is your goal?
[10:44:21] <PressedWeb> $('#items .item').attr('class').split(' ')[1]
[10:44:38] <ravenzz> what are you going to do with that class?
[10:44:49] <PressedWeb> Basically I'm trying to make some phony taskbar-like tabs to some phony div "windows"
[10:44:58] <PressedWeb> Trying to recreate windows with jQuery basically
[10:45:12] <ravenzz> lol
[10:45:26] <PressedWeb> I've got the minimizing stuff worked out, but I need to figure out how to link "windows" to "tabs"
[10:45:30] <PressedWeb> :)
[10:45:39] <PressedWeb> Once I get that, it'll be smooth sailing
[10:46:13] <ravenzz> do you want to check if the element has the bar class?
[10:46:15] <PressedWeb> So I figure I need to give the windows' their own unique classes. Then relate those to the tabs.
[10:46:34] <PressedWeb> Not sure how I'm going to go about it exactly. :)
[10:46:36] <ravenzz> man. you should use IDs then
[10:47:02] <PressedWeb> Well, I want to create/remove .window1, .window2, etc.
[10:47:25] <PressedWeb> Not a huge diff between ID's and classes so long as I'm not trying to reuse the ID's
[10:47:52] <ravenzz> you can taget elements by ID
[10:47:58] <ravenzz> you can't with classes
[10:48:04] <ravenzz> target
[10:49:56] <nFFF> an element can have an id and a class
[10:50:38] <ravenzz> <div id="window1" class="window"></div>
[10:50:46] <ravenzz> <div id="window2" class="window"></div>
[10:50:47] <ravenzz> and so on
[10:51:52] <PressedWeb> I can't target elements with classes like <div class="window window1"> ?
[10:52:02] <nFFF> Yea, sure makes the code more readable/mainanaible then all the split shit :DD
[10:52:05] <nFFF> you sure can
[10:52:19] <PressedWeb> Good point with getting rid of the split stuff
[10:52:33] <PressedWeb> Very good point actually
[10:52:40] <ravenzz> oh sorry maybe my sentence was misleading, because of my horrible english
[10:52:58] <ravenzz> with target I meant <a href="#window1">Window1</a>
[10:53:03] <ravenzz> on your taskbar
[10:53:18] <PressedWeb> Ah, yeah I see
[10:53:31] <ravenzz> so you can for example toggle() the window
[10:53:33] <PressedWeb> Yeah, I like that method better
[10:53:39] <ravenzz> like windows does
[10:54:07] <PressedWeb> Okay, let me mess around with this for a bit and see if I can get your method working (if there's a :target selector - which there is - I should be fine).
[10:54:19] <PressedWeb> Appreciate the help ravenzz
[10:54:24] <PressedWeb> and nFFF
[11:02:43] <PressedWeb> Well that didn't take long. What's the best way to store HTML in JS? JSON?
[11:02:51] <PressedWeb> Or string concatenation?
[11:03:18] <o-Haze-o> Can anyone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/Seanmcn/LG8B3/#base no errors or anything... it should be making an image appear above the menu.... #completely stumped
[11:03:37] <ravenzz> PressedWeb localStorage?
[11:03:47] <ravenzz> PressedWeb are you doing that just for fun?
[11:04:16] <Pat> hm ravenzz do you have a tutorial for pjax
[11:04:29] <Zerxer> o-Haze-o: var currentId = $('#navMenu li').attr('id');  <- this isn't going to grab the ID of the parent LI
[11:04:41] <ravenzz> Pat there should be a documentation on its website :o?
[11:04:48] <Zerxer> o-Haze-o: $('#mosquito ul li #' + currentId).toggle(); <- the space between li and the #id is saying the id is a child element of li, remove the space
[11:04:57] <PressedWeb> ravenzz: Actually it's for an online form of government. ;)
[11:05:02] <Zerxer> (which means it's currently selecting nothing)
[11:05:59] <ravenzz> PressedWeb uh? what is that?
[11:06:01] <aqeel> hi
[11:06:04] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/HjnEV/1/
[11:06:06] <Zerxer> o-Haze-o: var currentId = $(this).parent().attr('id');  (or just bind on the li hover, instead of the a's hover, and grab $(this).attr('id'))
[11:06:24] <PressedWeb> Hm, actually, forget all that JSON shtuff. I'll put the HTML in a random div, hide the div, and use it to template with. Mwahaha
[11:06:28] <PressedWeb> ravenzz: What do you mean?
[11:07:05] <aqeel> why is my click not working
[11:07:16] <ravenzz> it's for an online form of government
[11:07:19] <Viceroy> hel
[11:07:22] <Viceroy> hello
[11:07:27] <aqeel> the code at very end
[11:07:43] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/HjnEV/1/
[11:08:00] <smplstk> aqeel: because there's no HTML? lol
[11:08:01] <aqeel> my click will not call the page
[11:08:06] <aqeel> lol
[11:08:19] <smplstk> just a guess, but ya
[11:08:21] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[11:08:44] <aqeel> click 1 in main menu
[11:09:00] <aqeel> then call oneonehtml in submenu

[11:11:33] <aqeel> sorry coding.....in firefox and ie....
[11:12:18] <aqeel> can try those browsers...
[11:12:39] <smplstk> aqeel: just at a glance, it looks like you're calling your click before the menu is there?
[11:12:43] * smplstk shrugs
[11:12:46] <PressedWeb> ravenzz: Yeah. It's in it's beta version now and is testing pretty well, but it needs a facelift - where I come in.
[11:13:01] <raj> ravenzz, any experience with jstree?
[11:13:12] <ravenzz> raj no sorry
[11:13:14] <PressedWeb> ravenzz: Trying to give it an OS feel so people are comfortable with it and can do a lot of actions very quickly.
[11:13:17] <raj> blast
[11:13:22] <smplstk> aqeel: I just opened up my console and added: "$( '#linkoneone' ).click( function(e) { console.log( 'omg' ) } )"
[11:13:24] <smplstk> and it works
[11:13:47] <ngharo> ?delegate @ aqeel
[11:14:01] <smplstk> lol
[11:14:05] <smplstk> no bot-t

[11:14:45] <smplstk> aqeel: you can't attach an event handler to something that doesn't exist ;)
[11:15:05] <aqeel> so where to put that code in my flow
[11:15:24] <smplstk> aqeel: use on instead of click
[11:16:19] <smplstk> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:16:21] <aqeel> any sample......code?
[11:20:35] <aqeel> $("#linkoneone").on("click", function(){ $("#oneone").removeClass("hidethis"); 					$("#submenucontent").addClass("hidethis"); });

[11:49:54] <aqeel> yes
[11:49:57] <iatkotep> something like $('* :not **') ?
[11:49:59] <kzoo> does anyone know if a js event is thrown when i change the val() of an element, or are element change events thrown only when there is human interaction?
[11:52:53] <kzoo> Answered my own question. It's not dispatched, this just doesn't happen when it's programmatically changed. You are however free to fire the event when needed like this: $(element).val('value').change();
[11:54:39] <PressedWeb> I'm having some trouble iterating over some .page classes and assigning their unique ID's to tabs. It iterates over them sure, but it keeps piling the former iterations onto the new ones like: page1, page1 page2, page1 page2 page3... Anyone care to take a look? http://i.imgur.com/KR3DF.jpg

[12:42:41] <stones_> Hi guys, could someone help me out with a picture zoom feature?
[12:42:52] <stones_> The main picture zooms but the thumbnail is having issues
[12:53:35] <QF-MichaelK> $(this).attr('value') vs $(this).val(), the first seems to work for me while the second does not.  Should not these be identical aside from the fact that .val() works even if the value changes?
[13:02:45] <nFFF> ?val
[13:03:13] <nFFF> val is mainly used with form elements
[13:03:29] <nFFF> its not the same as attr()
[13:06:49] <QF-MichaelK> nFFF: Ah, ok. It's because I was using it in a div field like a true html noob forgot that it wasn't a valid attribute.
[13:17:38] <Transcended> When y'all were learning jquery, did the need to use delegate when loading in dynamic content throw you off at first?
[13:17:57] <QF-MichaelK> Yes.
[13:18:13] <a_L_p> hello, I am running into an issue with loading jquery on the page. I have my reference at the bottom of the page, and I am getting an error that says $ is not defined. How can I add jquery  at the bottom of my document and avoid this error?
[13:18:45] <Transcended> a_L_p: you should only have to include jquery once in the <head> section
[13:19:11] <a_L_p> oh, I thought best practice was to include in the foot of the page
[13:19:22] <nsanden> wouldnt $(document).ready(function() { } fire when document is well... ready
[13:19:58] <bla> As long as $ is defined., nsanden.
[13:20:27] <a_L_p> this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/dXPvfgFe
[13:20:45] <bla> a_L_p, really, use <head>
[13:21:45] <a_L_p> ok. thanks
[13:22:14] <bla> You can then add YOUR code at the bottom of the page is you want. Although separate file loaded in <head> is fine and (for me) preferred.
[13:24:35] <a_L_p> ok. that makes sense now, if I loaded the query script after query in the foot, but if I have the script inline on the page it wouldn't work unless the call to query library was in the head?
[13:25:04] <zduffy> Im using $supersized to produce a full page background. How can I disable this on a print css? I don't want the background printed.

[14:34:10] <zduffy> Whats the best way to load an external url into fancy box?
[14:34:20] <Vordreller> Question: I have a textarea. When I press the CTRL+S button, i want whatever is in there to be sent across to my db.
[14:34:37] <Vordreller> To prevent the default browser CTRL+S behavior, I have used e.preventDefault()
[14:34:51] <Vordreller> However, now I can't actually type any text in to the textarea
[14:35:00] <Vordreller> Code here: http://pastebin.com/1JyBcjr2
[14:35:11] <Vordreller> made it an alert since I need to get the text working first.
[14:36:08] <Vordreller> I'm guessing the preventDefault is preventing any typing from happening
[14:36:48] <Vordreller> so, how can I implement my code while avoiding the default behavior of the browser trying to save the page to an HTML file, and still be able to type in the textarea?
[14:36:56] <gehsekky> Vordreller: move the preventDefault into your if block
[14:38:39] <Vordreller> gehsekky: huzzah
[14:38:48] <Vordreller> I are teh dumb :(
[14:38:53] * Vordreller hides in shame
[14:39:04] <gehsekky> we've all been there
[14:39:08] <gehsekky> ;)
[14:39:35] <gehsekky> i once sat for 10 minutes trying to figure out why "my_array(5)" wasn't working
[14:39:53] <gehsekky> then i realized i wasn't in vb.net hehe.
[14:40:43] <danols1> hey all ok I a mootools user
[14:40:48] <danols1> I am using http://flex.madebymufffin.com/
[14:41:15] <danols1> how do I get the slider object so i can call it's properties ? --- i'm reading the advanced settings but it makes no sense
[14:41:33] <danols1> and $('.flexslider').flexslider(); returns a dom element not a slider instance
[14:41:33] <danols1>   
[14:42:37] <danols1> so what I would like to do is var slider_instance = $('.flexslider').flexslider();
[14:42:44] <danols1> slider_instance.pause() for example
[14:43:07] <danols1> is that possible ?
[14:43:11] <NoReGreT> $(selector).click(f() { $.getJSON(p,d,f() {$(this) }) })  $(this) here doesn't refer to the selector, how can i refer to teh current selector?
[14:43:28] <HardFu> how can i get the height of everything inside one element which has fixed height?
[14:44:07] <HardFu> for example if an element is 500px height but has 1000px worth of elements in height so scrollbar is 50%
[14:52:53] <NoReGreT> nevermind, i figured it out
[14:53:48] <danols> anyone ?
[14:54:22] <danols> i'm looking to do something like var flexslider = $('.flexslider').flexslider({..})
[14:54:53] <danols> flexslider.pause(); but I do not know how to acceses the slider instance through jquery syntax --- http://flex.madebymufffin.com/
[14:59:58] <b1lly> how come when i do $('selector').removeAttr('left'); its not removing anything
[15:00:27] <systemfault> What is a "left" attribute?
[15:02:54] <danols> please I beg of you jquery fans ---> http://dpaste.com/711134/
[15:03:40] <danols> notice how I am using a hack to get the slider instance --- how do you guys do this in jquery? in mootools normally if I initialize something I get an instance back to it so I can do: flexslider = $('.flexslider').flexslider({..})
[15:06:46] <danols> is anyone ever alive in here?
[15:08:11] <eddiemonge> all day every day
[15:09:24] <danols> ha ok
[15:09:27] <danols> just checking
[15:14:07] <bretteldridge> Whats happed with ie9 dropping slideToggle in the last few days? Anyone heard of this?
[15:15:29] <Vordreller> Question about the append() function. I just added some hyperlinks to a table: http://pastebin.com/cgcMEeWv
[15:15:44] <Vordreller> The big idea is that when you click one of the links, the row is to be deleted
[15:15:59] <Vordreller> However, I can't seem to reach the hyperlink
[15:17:23] <Vordreller> The following code does not work: http://pastebin.com/5Nc7RY32
[15:17:48] <Vordreller> Since jQuery 1.7, the on() function replaces the live() function, which is now deprecated
[15:17:58] <Vordreller> So I'm using on()
[15:18:29] <Vordreller> nothing is logged in the console, the alert doesn't happen and the link leads to google, so preventdefault also doesn't work
[15:42:46] <brittney> anyone familiar with jstree?
[15:49:47] <KarateKip3> suppose I have a piece of HTML code which i picked up from a random site. How do I get jQuery to parse that for me?

[16:06:34] <brittney> Cork, ping?
[16:07:04] <Vordreller> I saw jsfiddle in the topic of this channel, but was a bit confused. Your example helped out :p
[16:08:04] <brittney> Vordreller, ever worked with jstree
[16:08:04] <brittney> ?
[16:08:17] <Vordreller> brittney: no, I haven't
[16:08:25] <brittney> omg
[16:25:00] <fof> Vordreller: did you work it out?
[16:25:25] <Vordreller> no, I haven't figured it out yet
[16:25:32] <Vordreller> And the odd part is
[16:25:40] <Vordreller> the selector for the hyperlinks does work
[16:26:01] <Vordreller> if I add a click event just for TD and ask the size() of all <a> elements, it's 0 before and 3 after
[16:26:09] <fof> i cant work it out
[16:26:22] <Vordreller> yet that exact same query selector won't work for the deleting-part
[16:27:10] <eddiemonge> dont use .size()
[16:27:45] <Vordreller> And why not?
[16:29:14] <eddiemonge> its pointless, useless, and slower than just calling .length
[16:30:56] <Vordreller> yeah, documentation says the same
[16:31:01] <Vordreller> I'll do .length then
[16:32:35] <KevlarSoul> Any help with a jquery menu?
[16:33:23] <fof> well this works
[16:33:24] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/QxRAJ/6/
[16:33:51] <Vordreller> huh
[16:34:22] <Vordreller> Well, thanks for that.
[16:34:25] <Vordreller> This kinda confuses me
[16:34:31] <KevlarSoul> I have setup a tabbed menu and I want the main navigation menu to point to hidden divs in the tabbed menu on a certain page, this: When you click on the home page and try to navigate directly to an of the service sub menu items (except the first one, which is the default) it won't switch to it?
[16:34:38] <KevlarSoul> http://semiaspa.com/index.html
[16:34:39] <Vordreller> I'm gonna go check the documentation for as to why exactly this works and the old version doesn't
[16:35:06] <fof> well im also confused why i cant attach it to td then 'a'
[16:36:40] <eddiemonge> fof: whats your question?
[16:37:49] <Vordreller> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:38:00] <Vordreller> apparently, the 2nd argument is the "selector" argument
[16:38:07] <Vordreller> "A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event. If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element."
[16:38:35] <Vordreller> so, the functionality of binding to elements *after* they're created requires the use of the selector...
[16:39:11] <Vordreller> It's kina vague to describe it the way they do, I think
[16:39:21] <Transcended> Hey, I have a modal window that I'm using to pull in various content via ajax... however, I'm noticing that the scroll bar is remember its location even when closing/reopening... is there a way to set the scrollbar to the top via jquery?
[16:39:37] <fof> yes, just wondering why ...tr, 'a' workds but ...td, 'a' doesnt
[16:41:21] <fof> oh well, in any case this would make more sense http://jsfiddle.net/QxRAJ/7/
[16:42:36] <eddiemonge> fof: because that td doesnt exsit when you are binding
[16:43:09] <fof> :( of course
[16:43:25] <Vordreller> eddiemonge: but the documentation says that the on() function replaces the live() function
[16:43:35] <eddiemonge> it does
[16:43:42] <Vordreller> which was used to bind events to stuff that doesn't exist yet
[16:43:50] <Vordreller> If I'm correct
[16:43:52] <eddiemonge> but you still have to bind to something that exists in the DOM when you call the binding
[16:43:52] <systemfault> .on does both.
[16:45:30] <systemfault> $(selector).on(event, handler) == .bind    $(parentElement).on(event, selector, handler) == live (With live, parentElement would be document.body)
[16:45:42] <fof> the ad with an anchor doesnt exist, on the left side of on you must select what is already added on domready
[16:45:44] <eddiemonge> Vordreller: if the original selector doesnt exist, then binding to it does nothing. thats why if you are doing delegation, you have to bind to the closest parent that exists in the DOM
[16:45:47] <fof> td*
[16:46:48] <Vordreller> Well, this was certainly a good lesson :p
[16:52:08] <lord_D> http://pastebin.com/anXR3caS what is wrong with the output array?
[16:59:39] <Vordreller> lord_D: is there something wrong with it?
[16:59:50] <Vordreller> try doing console.log(output)
[16:59:56] <Vordreller> And then check it in firebug console
[17:03:35] <lord_D> its empty
[17:03:51] <lord_D> looks like the function Im using cant see global variables
[17:05:53] <Vordreller> Is that a function not shown in the pastebin?
[17:05:59] <lord_D> no
[17:06:20] <lord_D> are you sure console.log will show all the values in the array?
[17:06:25] <Vordreller> yes
[17:06:28] <Vordreller> it should
[17:06:29] <lord_D> what i get back is []
[17:06:48] <Vordreller> which would mean that your $('.fd tr') selector isn't working
[17:06:57] <Vordreller> because your flag remains 1
[17:07:04] <Vordreller> so that's where the code-flow is going to go
[17:07:26] <Vordreller> and if myPages is empty, nothing is going to be pushed to output
[17:07:39] <Vordreller> and if myPages is empty, it means the code inside $('.fd tr') was never executed
[17:19:46] <lord_D> 'sessionWorkflow2FproductWorkflow5B40product3D'Air'%5D.y=11'
[17:19:55] <lord_D> this is my problem
[17:20:22] <lord_D> Vordreller, Air is not being treated as a string
[17:20:45] <Vordreller> I don't see what you're referring to
[17:21:04] <Vordreller> There is no Air variable in the paste you linked
[17:21:15] <jofa_> Hi! I'm having an ajax search field which shows a suggestions container upon searching.
[17:21:17] <jofa_> When clicking anywhere outside the suggestions box, I would like the suggestions box to hide, and if the search field has a value greater than 0 and someone focus the field, I want the suggestions box to show up again.
[17:21:32] <jofa_> Anyone know how I should do? As it is now, when focusing the search field, the suggestions box shows up for about a half second and gets hidden, because jquery takes it as there's been a click on body.
[17:21:43] <jofa_> Anyone knows a solution to this? Here's my code so far: http://pastebin.com/BA53qqj1
[17:21:56] <lord_D> before i get to that code i create an array with two strings inside it
[17:22:30] <lord_D> one of the strings has bad formatting
[17:22:37] <Vordreller> k
[17:22:58] <lord_D> https'sessionWorkflow2FproductWorkflow5B40product3D'Air'%5D.y=11
[17:23:05] <lord_D> lets say it looks like that
[17:23:17] <lord_D> 'https'sessionWorkflow2FproductWorkflow5B40product3D'Air'%5D.y=11'
[17:23:24] <lord_D> i try to turn it into a string like that
[17:23:31] <lord_D> Air will be treated as a variable
[17:23:37] <jofa_> I've tried the :not filter to no avail
[17:25:18] <lord_D> but how do i keep the quotes?
[17:25:46] <lord_D> if i do +'Air'+ then literal quotes will be dropped. i dont want that
[17:27:37] <Vordreller> lord_D: have you tried combining single and double quotes?
[17:27:45] <Vordreller> It's basically the only way
[17:27:51] <Vordreller> that or escape them, if possible
[17:27:59] <Vordreller> so \' instead of just '
[17:28:19] <lord_D> http://pastebin.com/776cWjhf this is a before and after paste
[17:28:44] <Vordreller> jofa_: try looking up the focus() and unfocus() functions
[17:28:45] <lord_D> wouldnt \' include a backslash?
[17:28:47] <Vordreller> no guarantee though
[17:28:56] <Vordreller> not if it's a string
[17:29:26] <lord_D> so if i put one on all the internal quotes i will be fine?
[17:29:28] <Vordreller> quotes in names that need to stay there, have to be escaped
[17:29:38] <jofa_> Vordreller
[17:29:41] <Vordreller> Probably
[17:29:48] <jofa_> thanks, weill look it up
[17:29:51] <lord_D> and external quotes dont have to be escaped
[17:29:52] <Vordreller> and there's also probably a function on the internet somewhere that does this for you
[17:30:11] <Vordreller> External quotes would be the quotes to indicate it's a string
[17:40:12] <Transcended> Hey guys, I have a div within a div that a user can enter/delete comments in... when I open the comments div it pushes the siblings of the parent down... but when I delete comments, the container gets smaller but the sibling divs don't move up like they should until I collapse the comments div... any ideas?

[18:05:57] <InDigital> nothing happens?
[18:05:59] <y2E0>  and I want to let other pages act as "tabs" to this page, possible? < do you mean it loads in the "main area" without loading a complete other page?
[18:06:46] <KevlarSoul> Right
[18:06:48] <KevlarSoul> No
[18:07:18] <KevlarSoul> I want to be from any other page, and navigate via the main menu, to a "display: none" div on the Service Menu page
[18:08:10] <KevlarSoul> AS it is it goes to the default display:block" div, but I cant get the subsequent ones to open up through to their respective tabs
[18:08:27] <InDigital> if your menu entrys (links) is dynamic, maybe you need to use LIVE
[18:08:42] <KevlarSoul> find a way to trigger the tab script via the main menu in other pages
[18:09:58] <KevlarSoul> i guess essentially have the drop down menu item act as a tab
[18:10:12] <KevlarSoul> for the tabbed menu on the service menu page
[18:10:33] <KevlarSoul> I dont know what you mean by use LIVE
[18:11:46] <InDigital> LIVE is used to make some functions run if some HTML element is created after page load
[18:12:36] <KevlarSoul> js live?
[18:12:39] <KevlarSoul> live.js?
[18:13:34] <InDigital> $('.attchmnthref').live('click', function() { bla bla bla });
[18:14:09] <KevlarSoul> okay let me look into via google
[18:14:26] <InDigital> $('.url_style_name').live('click', function() { DO GO TO PAGE FUNCTION });
[18:16:21] <InDigital> an then use - this.name or this.alt as a variable (real url) or what you want
[18:19:54] <eddiemonge> dont use live
[18:19:58] <eddiemonge> its deprecated
[18:21:00] <eddiemonge> ?on delegation
[18:22:05] <y2E0> yes on is no used to attach function handlers.

[18:22:31] <Chibby_> could anyone please help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Chib/h83N7/1/
[18:22:33] <Chibby_> I'm trying to work out how I can get the .change() function to work on the new elements it creates
[18:24:14] <y2E0> you forgot to close the input
[18:24:17] <y2E0>  />
[18:24:53] <eddiemonge> Chibby_: because you need to delegate the input handlers
[18:26:32] <y2E0> change will probably call .on which attaches the event handlers to elements currently presen in the dom
[18:26:52] <Chibby_> eddiemonge: thanks, do you know where I can read up on that?
[18:27:02] <y2E0> append() adds another element after the event handlers been attached. so you have to bind a new event handler to this elemnt or delegate it e.g. to the parent div
[18:27:28] <y2E0> http://api.jquery.com/on/ > Direct and delegated events
[18:27:38] <Chibby_> thanks

[18:28:56] <Chibby_> awesome, thanks
[18:30:26] <y2E0> this delegation thingy is so neat. i was close to ask why is it possible that a div can listen to change events, always overreade the on's 2nd paramter.
[18:35:49] <chunger> Hi all. I've got a whole buttload of images and I would like to scale them all so that they're a fixed height. I don't want to break their aspect ratios if possible. Can I do that with jquery?
[18:46:01] <eddiemonge> chunger: that should be done on the server
[18:46:53] <chunger> eddiemonge: It's not possible to resize the images client-side?
[18:47:24] <miket3> chunger, why would you want to?
[18:47:30] <eddiemonge> chunger: it is but it isnt optimal, like at all
[18:48:07] <miket3> grab a util and resize them
[18:49:10] <centr0> this is madness!  why is my to_yaml method outputting binary!
[18:50:02] <chunger> we're loading the images from a third party (imagine if we loaded 300 gravatars on one page) but the images are not all the same size, so we want the client to load them and the resizing to be done on the client-side.
[18:50:50] <eddiemonge> chunger: you know that if they are resized client side that its still loading the full image and then letting the browser scale it right?
[18:51:42] <chunger> yes, I'm aware of that. But the alternative seems to be that instead of the client loading them, I load them all on the backend, run them through a utility, and then send optimized images to the client on the fly. Isn't that going to be a performance issue as well?
[18:53:14] <eddiemonge> chunger: now if they are cached
[18:53:17] <eddiemonge> not
[18:55:01] <miket3> if you only have 1 client and you know they have good client-side hardware.... go for it
[18:55:45] <miket3> otherwise optimize prior
[18:56:17] <chunger> So if I were to do it client-side, any thoughts on how? Do browsers have built-in image resizing or do I have to find some js library?
[18:56:57] <miket3> chunger, <img  width="10px"
[18:57:33] <miket3> or in your case height=10px
[18:57:57] <miket3> u dont even need jquery
[18:58:40] <chunger> nice
[18:58:51] <chunger> miket3: ok thanks
[19:01:08] <stormburger> so a website using jquery if you minify the jquery library in with your other javascript code how do you comply properly with the license? just put "Portions copyright  "?
[19:02:21] <y2E0> wouldn't it be easier to include a minfied js?
[19:02:33] <y2E0> jquery.js file
[19:03:18] <zduffy> Does anyone know how to disable $.supersized at print?
[19:03:42] <stormburger> yes well i guess more generally for example there are lots of handy query plugins that are like 100 lines, so i want to bundle them all up together but want to ensure i honor the license, they are all MIT
[19:05:22] <lmao25> How can I do this: Do X when everything in the dom is clicked except #footer
[19:05:49] <lmao25> what function can i use for exceptions?
[19:06:00] <stormburger> .not('#footer')
[19:06:08] <stormburger> add that to your chain
[19:06:13] <lmao25> thx
[19:06:16] <stormburger> np :)
[19:06:20] <eddiemonge> stormburger: keep the license and just minify the code. but you shouldnt be minifying jquery since its already minified and likely to be cached if you include from a CDN like google
[19:06:21] <lmao25> is .not new?
[19:06:37] <stormburger> no idea but i use it a lot lmao :)
[19:06:37] <eddiemonge> lmao25: look at event.target
[19:06:56] <eddiemonge> lmao25: but why do you want to do something on every single click?
[19:07:45] <lmao25> eddiemonge, if the footer is currently open i need to close it
[19:08:03] <lmao25> so i would need to check if it's open or not..
[19:08:12] <lmao25> not sure if i'm going about it the right way or not
[19:08:36] <lmao25> users can slideToggle the footer, but if users navigate to another section the footer needs to close back down
[19:31:12] <vampire_weekend> hello
[19:31:30] <vampire_weekend> my goal is to enable/disable the checkboxes but this doesn't work
[19:32:46] <RandalSchwartz> are you using .prop and not .attr?
[19:33:08] <RandalSchwartz> .prop('checked', true)
[19:33:21] <RandalSchwartz> oh - enable
[19:33:22] <RandalSchwartz> not check
[19:33:25] <RandalSchwartz> but still. :)
[19:33:36] <RandalSchwartz> .prop('disabled', true)
[19:33:44] <RandalSchwartz> vampire_weekend?
[19:34:37] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, another drive-by
[19:34:38] <jamesw> hi!  would someone please look at this and see if they have any ideas on how to improve the accuracy? http://jsfiddle.net/NUyHR/
[19:34:41] <vampire_weekend> http://jsfiddle.net/8VkW2/1/
[19:34:50] <vampire_weekend> sorry RandalSchwartz
[19:39:57] <vampire_weekend> Please help me... http://jsfiddle.net/8VkW2/1/
[19:41:12] <RandalSchwartz> vampire_weekend - did you read what I said?
[19:41:27] <RandalSchwartz> oh - let me read what you're trying
[19:42:17] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  not sure what happens if $('.read_only') returns more than one item
[19:42:20] <RandalSchwartz> and what that does for .is
[19:42:38] <RandalSchwartz> seems pretty presumptive that there's only one of each class
[19:43:24] <RandalSchwartz> oh - this code isn't in an "on-ready"
[19:43:32] <RandalSchwartz> and you are referring to things with .change
[19:43:43] <RandalSchwartz> maybe you want .on('change') so that it'll be deferred
[19:43:53] <LekeFly> If i have a merged .js file including jquery google cnd cache wont matter.. ?
[19:43:55] <RandalSchwartz> else put everything inside a "document ready" function
[19:44:09] <RandalSchwartz> $(function() { ... })
[19:44:25] <RandalSchwartz> that's my first guess... your binding aren't applying
[19:44:56] <RandalSchwartz> vampire_weekend?
[19:45:55] <RandalSchwartz> anyway - gotta run out for 5 minutes... back shortly
[19:59:38] <Nadia> test
[20:00:10] <Narnia> yo flatheads
[20:00:13] <Narnia> =)
[20:00:14] <Hopsy> Hi Narnia
[20:00:24] <Narnia> How is it hanging, banana?
[20:22:09] <vampire_weekend> RandalSchwartz
[20:22:18] <vampire_weekend> sorry I got the disconnected
[20:22:26] <RandalSchwartz> hey
[20:22:43] <RandalSchwartz> so what's the problem you see once you shift it to being inside an "on ready"
[20:22:45] <vampire_weekend> have you tracked the bug?
[20:22:47] <RandalSchwartz> or with .on?
[20:28:02] <vampire_weekend> This still doesn't works
[20:28:03] <vampire_weekend> http://jsfiddle.net/8VkW2/2/
[20:28:39] <RandalSchwartz> vampire_weekend - still don't see either .on('change' ...) or inside a document-ready delay
[20:28:51] <RandalSchwartz> please fix one or the other of those, and report again
[20:29:30] <RandalSchwartz> as in... consider what $('....').change means if executed BEFORE the dom element is ready./
[20:29:33] <RandalSchwartz> it does NOTHING.
[20:31:57] <eddiemonge> vampire_weekend: what are you trying to do? what is $this ?
[20:32:09] <fotoflo> Hi, quick question: I have a $("#myDialog").dialog()  and I want to position with $("#myDiv").position({"my": "left bottom", "at" : "left bottom", "of" : "#myDialog"})  but #myDialog is not what i expect --- because after the .dialog() jquery-ui is apparently appending some divs -- anyway i want to position based on those divs - any clues how to select them?
[20:32:52] <eddiemonge> dialogs are usually centered
[20:33:00] <eddiemonge> you want to change that?
[20:33:31] <eddiemonge> and your example is positioning it relative to itself
[20:33:41] <RandalSchwartz> that'll confuse it
[20:33:55] <LukeNukem> Hello, can someone tell me hwo to do a selection based on rel attribute
[20:34:03] <LukeNukem> my internet is really slow i cant access the docs
[20:34:40] <coldhead> $('span[rel="somerel"]')
[20:34:54] <coldhead> $('span[rel^="startswith"]')
[20:34:58] <RandalSchwartz> and yet - you have IRC!
[20:35:04] <RandalSchwartz> why are your docs remote?
[20:35:06] <coldhead> $('span[rel*="anywhere"]')
[20:35:08] <RandalSchwartz> don't you have a local copy?
[20:35:34] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: i want to position the myDiv relative to myDialog
[20:35:49] <fotoflo> 's bottom left corner
[20:36:22] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: what is myDiv? is it a child of the dialog?
[20:36:55] <eddiemonge> RandalSchwartz: do you? i dont
[20:37:14] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: does that matter? .position() should be able to position anything relative to anything else
[20:38:00] <LukeNukem> coldhead, for an a tag?
[20:38:00] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: should be but like i said, a dialog is meant to be a dialog. what exactly are you trying to do? and dont you position or dialog in your explanation
[20:38:10] <LukeNukem> a[rel..
[20:38:15] <fotoflo> no i have my dialog already positioned
[20:38:20] <vampire_weekend> I'm trying to disable the other checkboxes
[20:38:29] <Chibby_> hmm, does anyone know if there's a way to make input:file elements show only the file name instead of the entire directory?
[20:38:29] <vampire_weekend> once the read_only has been ticked
[20:38:30] <fotoflo> i want to position elements within the modal
[20:38:41] <vampire_weekend> otherwise read_only will be disabled
[20:39:03] <eddiemonge> vampire_weekend: what is $this?
[20:39:28] <eddiemonge> Chibby_: i find it best not to try and change input type file
[20:39:47] <vampire_weekend> var $this = $(this);
[20:39:53] <vampire_weekend> I deleted it sorry
[20:40:23] <Chibby_> eddiemonge: hmm yeah i think i'll just have the file name show in a div next to it
[20:42:23] <eddiemonge> vampire_weekend: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/8VkW2/3/
[20:43:29] <LukeNukem> thanks coldhead now i see how a lot of lightbox plugins work :>
[20:46:57] <tetradon> How do I get the next element with class so-and-so?
[20:47:36] <vampire_weekend> am sorry it doesn't work
[20:47:37] <tetradon> I can't get .closest to do this for some reason
[20:47:48] <RandalSchwartz> can't say "doesn't work"
[20:47:52] <RandalSchwartz> what DOES it doe
[20:48:05] <RandalSchwartz> and have you added enough debugging or even alert() to know what's being triggered?
[20:48:16] <eddiemonge> tetradon: closest looks at ancestors not siblings
[20:48:39] <tetradon> yeah but then I can get the children of closest with class name
[20:48:50] <tetradon> however it isn't working in this case
[20:49:09] <RandalSchwartz> use .siblings()
[20:49:35] <RandalSchwartz> .siblinks('.foo')
[20:49:40] <RandalSchwartz> err
[20:49:42] <RandalSchwartz> can't type :)
[20:51:13] <tetradon> Yeah that worked. Thanks RandalSchwartz.
[20:51:27] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: so any ideas on how to position relative to a jquery-ui dialog?
[20:53:34] <eddiemonge> i still dont know why you would want to do that so no
[20:54:19] <eddiemonge> vampire_weekend: http://jsfiddle.net/8VkW2/5/
[20:55:20] <vampire_weekend> thanks man but that doesn't what suit my need
[20:55:23] <vampire_weekend> thanks though
[20:56:52] <eddiemonge> wtf? thats what you asked for wasnt it?
[20:59:28] <vampire_weekend> I think my code is quite clear that when the read is ticked add&approve will be disabled
[20:59:56] <eddiemonge> so only read only disables the others?
[21:00:12] <vampire_weekend> but if the ticked is either add/approve only read will be disabled
[21:00:28] <vampire_weekend> yes
[21:00:45] <eddiemonge> so reports is never disabled or disables anything right?
[21:00:58] <vampire_weekend> just add/approve report will stick as normal checkbox
[21:01:09] <vampire_weekend> thanks man :)
[21:01:55] <vampire_weekend> hello?
[21:03:18] <tman-> ello ello
[21:03:25] <vampire_weekend> olle olle
[21:03:37] <tman-> i have a series of tr's where one of the column is a select box
[21:03:52] <tman-> number of options is determined by the number of trs
[21:03:56] <tman-> sec lemme fire it up
[21:04:23] <eddiemonge> vampire_weekend: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/8VkW2/6/
[21:04:32] <tman-> vampire_weekend: http://heers.holmberg.ca/admin/tools.html
[21:04:34] <vampire_weekend> thankies
[21:04:36] <tman-> idea is...
[21:04:50] <tman-> .change() fires
[21:05:10] <eddiemonge> tman-: why not just use sortable?
[21:05:10] <tman-> target the tr of the selector and move it based on the value
[21:05:12] <tman-> oh
[21:05:20] <tman-> sortable.. didn't know that method
[21:05:38] <tman-> oh sweet
[21:05:40] <tman-> jqui
[21:09:22] <tman-> does it have to be a list
[21:09:26] <tman-> or can i target trs?
[21:09:38] <brittney> has anyone used jstree?
[21:10:23] <coldhead> some people claim to have used jstree but how can we ever really be sure?
[21:10:29] <coldhead> what IS certainty?
[21:13:01] <eddiemonge> so many issues with jstree lately
[21:13:10] <eddiemonge> its either super crappy or getting super popular
[21:14:39] <brittney> eddiemonge, I agree!
[21:14:44] <brittney> i don't like the docs
[21:15:45] <brittney> and this just returns 'colors', although I'm trying to get a list, or json object with all the id's of checked nodes http://paste.ofcode.org/38e7DwkEnmYmxR7jsxcxhdR
[21:15:53] <brittney> i've been at it for 3 days
[21:17:28] <brittney> I'm actually trying to make an ajax post with that list
[21:17:34] <brittney> but I can't get the stupid list
[21:17:54] <PressedWeb> Hey folks, I'm trying to grab all the content within each anchor on my page, rename each anchor on my page as a span, and dump the saved content into the span. Can anyone help me out? http://pastie.org/3516159
[21:18:07] <brittney> the other option is doing it manually eddiemonge, coldhead
[21:18:29] <brittney> what do you think of making real checkboxes and using js to make a collapsible tree?
[21:18:32] <eddiemonge> PressedWeb: why do you want to do that?
[21:19:04] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: hehe, I knew that'd be the first question everyone asked. There's a legit reason.
[21:19:11] <eddiemonge> which is?
[21:19:24] <PressedWeb> I'm trying to make a Windows-like desktop, with a taskbar on the bottom
[21:19:38] <cesaro> try installing windows
[21:19:50] <PressedWeb> Browsers (*cough Chrome cough*) throw a status bar on top of the taskbar everytime you hover over a link
[21:20:05] <PressedWeb> Which basically cuts off half the taskbar/words
[21:20:25] <PressedWeb> Now, I need those to be anchors when someone reaches the page so Google with crawl the site
[21:20:49] <PressedWeb> But there's no way to get rid of that obnoxious status bar
[21:21:00] <eddiemonge> PressedWeb: here's a hint. they only show that when the anchor has a href attribute
[21:21:04] <brittney> eddiemonge, do you see what's wrong with my code?
[21:21:16] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: o rly?
[21:21:26] <eddiemonge> brittney: didnt look. i try to avoid plugins i know nothing about it. doubly so for jstree
[21:21:35] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: Well, Google can't crawl href-less anchors can it?
[21:21:41] <brittney> oh, I thought you meant you've used it before
[21:21:53] <eddiemonge> PressedWeb: this might help you: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3686#issuecomment-4268226
[21:21:54] <socialhapy>  Issue #3686 on jquery-mobile, reported by JFK99 (3d, 6h ago): $("a").live("click") returns different values on desktop browsers and on iOS safari since jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 RC1
[21:22:03] <brittney> eddiemonge, would writing a custom tree myself be ludacris?
[21:22:27] <eddiemonge> brittney: nope.
[21:22:59] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: Works for iOS I suppose, but I'm still getting status bar on Chrome.
[21:23:16] <brittney> i'm not sure how i'd do a 3 state checkbox that recognizes whether the children are not all checked or all checked or not checked at all
[21:23:54] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: Hover over links to see Chrome status bar in bottom left - http://jsbin.com/ocezih/56
[21:24:04] <eddiemonge> PressedWeb: $("a").each(function() { var t = $(this); t.data("href", t.attr("href")).removeAttr("href") });
[21:24:37] <eddiemonge> PressedWeb: thats not replacing the hrefs since its not iOS.
[21:25:02] <PressedWeb> OH!
[21:25:20] <brittney> eddiemonge, any thoughts?
[21:25:22] <PressedWeb> I see your hint now
[21:25:33] <PressedWeb> Google crawls page, THEN hrefs are removed
[21:26:39] <eddiemonge> dont forgot to add the .on("click", window.location = $(this).data("href")
[21:27:04] <PressedWeb> Is it even adding the data-href? Not showing up in Inspector
[21:27:20] <eddiemonge> data doesnt show in the inspector
[21:32:07] <PressedWeb> eddiemonge: Thank you so much! Everything is working perfectly. You've helped me several times in the past. Let me know if you ever need some freebie design work.
[21:41:32] <Transcended> eh-lo ... is there a way to track upload progress strictly through ajax and a backend language like php?  Everything I find seems to use some type of flash object.  If so, does anyone know of any good tutorials on the matter.

[22:06:59] <arthurdent> how do I set a css element to the value it was before I animated it?
[22:09:07] <jamesw> how can i get all elements on the page in a flat jq object?
[22:09:27] <arthurdent> i don't think anyone is in here
[22:16:52] <jamesw> how can i get all elements on the page in a flat jq object?
[22:18:45] <raj> how do I get a list of input elements with type='text'?
[22:19:00] <raj> so I can do something with .each() of them
[22:19:41] <arthurdent> how do I set a css element to the value it was before I animated it?
[22:21:39] <eddiemonge> arthurdent: by setting a value as a variable and then reverting it
[22:21:47] <eddiemonge> jamesw: flat jq object?
[22:22:02] <eddiemonge> raj: $("input[type='text']")
[22:22:39] <raj> thanks eddiemonge
[22:23:18] <arthurdent> eddiemonge: i've been using jquery for all of 5 hours, how do i get a css value of an element?
[22:26:53] <fotoflo> arthurdent: .css("width") gets the width
[22:26:59] <raj> eddiemonge, i put console.log around that and it returned an objecet
[22:27:05] <raj> is that a json object?
[22:27:38] <fotoflo> raj JSON.stringify()
[22:28:37] <eddiemonge> raj: its a jQ object
[22:28:50] <raj> it's freaking huge
[22:28:54] <eddiemonge> ?css @ arthurdent

[22:28:58] <arthurdent> thank you :D
[22:28:59] <raj> not sure how I should be extracting my data outta there
[22:30:25] <eddiemonge> raj: what are you trying to get? that returns all inputs of type text
[22:31:57] <raj> eddiemonge, for example. say I use type="checkbox" and search for those
[22:32:03] <raj> how do i see if it's checked or not
[22:34:59] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: Im still having trouble positing inside of a .dialog() -- do you have any tips on how to select it (ideally id like to add an id to it,)
[22:36:01] <eddiemonge> raj: have you read the getting started guide yet?
[22:36:21] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: select what?
[22:37:41] <raj> eddiemonge, yes
[22:37:48] <fotoflo> eddie the outermost div
[22:37:50] <fotoflo> in the dialog
[22:37:53] <fotoflo> so i can position against it
[22:39:47] <eddiemonge> raj: then you should know how to work with jq objects
[22:40:03] <fotoflo> http://screencast.com/t/kjxcDFT9vE
[22:40:10] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: is what you are trying to position a child element?
[22:40:16] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: ^
[22:40:28] <jamesw> eddiemonge: i mean instead of div div div i'd like the contents of the div say button button button as well as their parent divs, all in the first level of the jq object
[22:40:36] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: a child of?
[22:40:41] <fotoflo> its a child of something
[22:40:44] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am having an issue with Jquery fileupload whereby when I upload one image to my live server, it is showing up on the server with two images. locally this isn't an issue. https://gist.github.com/4ff7f7f2ee8be010b2ee
[22:41:21] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: i can append it to whatever
[22:41:38] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: what should i append it to?
[22:43:46] <systemfault> Super question.. does jquery support :scope like the recent qsa draft mentions
[22:43:50] <eddiemonge> jamesw: why? what do you think a jqobject is?
[22:44:15] <jamesw> eddiemonge: .. an array of dom objects and metadata?
[22:44:33] <fotoflo> $("#parent").dialog()  right now I'm appending the #positionMe to #parent -- does that answer your question?
[22:44:56] <eddiemonge> systemfault: whats it do/show?
[22:45:52] <eddiemonge> jamesw: correct. so what exactly are you trying to do?
[22:46:07] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: why cant you use normal css for it?
[22:46:47] <systemfault> eddiemonge: Let's say you have a list <ul> of lists... and you have var list = $('myList'). How would you get all the <li> at the first level?
[22:46:57] <systemfault> eddiemonge: With a selector

[22:47:14] <jamesw> given the html <body><div><button/></div>, how do i get the jq object [div, button]?
[22:47:39] <systemfault> eddiemonge: list.find( ???? )
[22:47:45] <eddiemonge> $("div").add(">button")
[22:47:49] <raj> eddiemonge, you're right, I haven't read this
[22:47:52] <systemfault> eddiemonge: Ah, it works?
[22:47:55] <systemfault> Cool.
[22:47:57] <eddiemonge> systemfault: list.children("li")
[22:47:57] <jamesw> does $('body *') return infinite levels of children?
[22:48:10] <eddiemonge> jamesw: yes
[22:48:16] <systemfault> eddiemonge: I knew for children, wanted to know for .find
[22:48:29] <eddiemonge> find(">li")
[22:50:15] <systemfault> eddiemonge: I was reading w3c posts about using a :scope pseudo selector.. but now that I know that '> li' works..
[22:50:23] <systemfault> Cheers.
[22:50:53] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: I've tried, but with little success
[22:51:32] <eddiemonge> fotoflo: use inspector to find stuff and test
[22:51:55] <fotoflo> eddie
[22:52:02] <fotoflo> eddiemonge: of course,
[22:53:33] <sahbeewah> fotoflo: there's an option called dialogClass which you can use
[22:56:40] <fotoflo> playing with that
[22:56:58] <fotoflo> sahbeewah: i saw that before actually, but no way to make an ID?
[22:57:16] <fotoflo> sahbeewah: hey hey it works!
