[00:12:56] <niftylettuce> if anyone here uses Twitter Bootstrap, they will appreciate this... please upvote "Show HN: Twitter Bootstrap modal responsive (mobile) fix with jQuery" at http://news.ycombinator.com/newest
[00:31:25] <ravenzz> someone said that bootstrap is the new dreamweaver, which is almost true lol
[00:48:05] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have a table (class= testtable) with tr's (class= testtablerow) and for every tr i want to add a click event. Can someone tell me how i can do that?
[00:50:03] <ravenzz> $('.testtable tr').on('click', function (e) { });
[00:50:14] <IvanKuzev> ?.on
[00:50:16] <bot-t> IvanKuzev, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:51:47] <Krambiorix> thx!!!
[00:57:32] <Krambiorix> ravenzz, i add my html table with jquery with append(data); and then add your handler. But now it doesn't show the table anymore....
[00:58:37] <Kit-10> Krambiorix don't bind like that if you're updating the table
[00:58:47] <IvanKuzev> it shoudnt behave this way...ravenzz solution was correct...but not live
[00:59:02] <Kit-10> do $('.testtable').on('click', 'tr', fn() {})
[00:59:28] <Kit-10> do that once, and once only after domready
[01:00:06] <IvanKuzev> but if you have the whole table(not only rows added after the event handler)?
[01:00:21] <BinaryKitten> ??
[01:01:34] <BinaryKitten> .on with 3 items does delegation. which is much better than re-binding after adding rows
[01:02:08] <BinaryKitten> it still works the same as ravenzz snippet, but you don't have to rebind, you don't have to worry about double binding
[01:02:16] <BinaryKitten> and it's a better on performance
[01:02:19] <BinaryKitten> anyway
[01:02:22] * BinaryKitten departs
[01:03:32] <Krambiorix> BinaryKitten, i don't add rows, i append the table to the document
[01:05:27] <Krambiorix> IvanKuzev, if i put this after the append: $('#eventtable tr').on('click', function (e) { alert('tt'); });  my table is never appended to the document
[01:05:57] <IvanKuzev> you messed up something else then
[01:10:29] <Krambiorix> IvanKuzev, can the cause be that the table is added with an ajax request?
[01:11:20] <IvanKuzev> well the event might not work....but you shoud still be able to see the table
[01:11:58] <IvanKuzev> do you have a demo
[01:14:06] <Krambiorix> IvanKuzev, it works!! I messed up my table by adding some stuff
[01:14:12] <Krambiorix> Thanks a lot !!!!
[01:14:52] <IvanKuzev> :) good luck
[01:34:55] <cheesypoof20> What should the correct formatting be for this, its for twitter bootstrap tooltips: $('.cart-add').tooltip('show', {placement: 'left'});
[01:45:33] <BoSkiv> Hi All
[01:48:02] <IvanKuzev> hi
[01:50:19] <BoSkiv> Guys I have a question for your. I have a page with jquery.post request. Request is refresh status of network interfaces every second and if interface down then state change on page. All works fine, but I'm confused with huge POST requests in my ssl_access_logs. Is it normal solution ? Is there best way to decrease number of Request in my logs except increase refresh timeout ?
[01:55:38] <coldhead> BoSkiv: are you asking how you can make fewer requests apart from actually making fewer requests?
[01:55:58] <coldhead> i think the only way to make fewer requests is to make fewer requests :(
[01:56:07] <coldhead> can we see your code?
[01:56:08] <BoSkiv> ))
[01:56:19] <BoSkiv> sure
[01:58:30] <Tak0r> hi
[01:58:47] <BoSkiv> can I put in main chat ?
[01:58:54] <jrockjiggz> hello.. i'm trying to pick up an element from my returned data (fragment), and if the element is in the root, i use filter(), but if its burried, i need to use find().. but how can i decipher which to use? Its not very efficient doing a filter TTHEN find
[01:59:26] <Tak0r> i have a problem with multiple accordions nested in tables. i can inject remove & update items in the first one, in the second one in another tab it's not working whatsoever. every accordion and corresponding items have unique id's
[01:59:29] <therealklanni> boskiv use jsfiddle
[01:59:36] <Tak0r> anyone who can help me find the problem?
[02:00:26] <Tak0r> ohh i should mention i debugged heavily with firebug already but found no problem in the corresponding ajax reply's or id's not being set
[02:03:59] <BoSkiv> http://jsfiddle.net/paEQG/
[02:04:43] <coldhead> jrockjiggz: this is how i'd do it (if i understand you correctly) http://jsfiddle.net/qHGDk/
[02:06:58] <coldhead> BoSkiv: i made one tiny change to the setTimeout http://jsfiddle.net/paEQG/1/
[02:07:02] <coldhead> otherwise it looks okay to me
[02:07:16] <coldhead> if that is firing too many calls then you should change the frequency
[02:07:23] <coldhead> i can't think of another way
[02:07:47] <BoSkiv> Yeah, thanks a lot coldhead...
[02:11:22] <sbfds> if i have a script tag with id FOO and the FOO script creates another script element in the DOM called BAR and document.body.appendChild()s it, will BAR execute fully before FOO continues it's execution?
[02:17:01] <BoSkiv> coldhead, I found solution in http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#accesslog. I just remove my unusable requests from access_log
[02:17:43] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: thanks, it looks in your example that you are doing both find and filter regardless. I actually broke it into stages using if/else statments.. a little messy, but i think uses less resources http://jsfiddle.net/qHGDk/1/
[02:24:53] <hemanth> is there a neat way to extract links using css selectors from an XHR response
[02:25:03] <hemanth> ?
[02:28:49] <jrockjiggz> var url = $('a.cssName').attr('href');
[02:30:28] <hemanth> jrockjiggz: on responseText ?
[02:32:18] <alexidoia> I'd like to get a div which has a attr style, I'd like to copy its content into another div and remove its style attar then. I know how to do this, but when I remove the style attr in the copied div, it also remove it from the original div, how can I create a copy so I can act on the new object and not on the original ?
[02:32:51] <ruby_on_tails> what is attr style ?
[02:33:48] <SlexAxton> var attrVal = $('.orig').attr('key'); $('#other').attr('key', attrVal); $('.orig').removeAttr('key');
[02:33:55] <alexidoia> ruby_on_tails: clone() is my sol
[02:33:58] <alexidoia> thanks anyway
[02:34:04] <alexidoia> attribute style
[02:38:42] <Afflicto> Hey all. I'm trying to use $().closest(); but it doesn't seem to work. I have tried reading the documentation with no success. Thanks
[02:42:12] <toresbe> Afflicto: I don't have the requisite knowledge to offer any help, but even if I did I wouldn't be able to help you because that question is very vague. You should specify expected behaviour and observed behaviour.
[02:42:23] <sasaa> gggg
[02:42:39] <sasaa> m,,m,
[02:51:24] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i do $('.testtable tr').on('click', function (event) { alert(event.target.id);});   -> but my id is empty? While i have an id on the table row... What can be the cause?
[02:52:15] <ruby_on_tails> Krambiorix: $(this).id(); try this
[02:53:31] <Krambiorix> ruby_on_tails, $(this).id() -> is not a function , when i try $(this).id -> undefined...
[02:53:52] <ruby_on_tails> $(this).attr("id")
[02:54:48] <Krambiorix> ruby_on_tails, that works!   why not $(this).id ?
[02:55:48] <ruby_on_tails> i guess there is no function like that
[02:56:05] <ruby_on_tails> never used event.target.id so not sure
[02:57:35] <Krambiorix> ruby_on_tails, okay, thanks a lot!
[03:45:14] <ravenzz> Tak0r try to select the accordion on the hidden tab and see what you get (console.log of the selection.length)
[03:54:26] <Tak0r> ravenzz you mean console.log($('#mydiv').length); ?
[03:55:59] <ravenzz> you said that the accordions in the other tabs aren't populated right?
[03:56:17] <Tak0r> nono
[03:56:30] <Tak0r> it's populated and when i select the tab it show's correctly
[03:56:39] <Tak0r> but i can't modify the dom there whatsoever :(
[04:27:37] <alexidoia> how to determine if an array is empty ?
[04:28:17] <ravenzz> check against its length
[04:30:55] <Libin> hello can someone please tell me what is causing the error in this statement :   $("#rotator-content ."+choice).delay(500).fadeIn().addClass("active");

[04:55:13] <SoulRaven> hello
[04:55:31] <johnkpaul> hello
[04:55:36] <SoulRaven> how i update different section of the site using a single ajax call
[04:55:47] <BBJames> Howdy
[04:55:58] <SoulRaven> i want to extract from ajax callback, some div's
[04:56:02] <johnkpaul> ?load @ SoulRaven
[04:56:03] <bot-t> SoulRaven, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[04:56:11] <johnkpaul> ha no
[04:56:28] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:56:35] <Libin> did u find the error?
[04:57:56] <SoulRaven> i know about load, but i want to make 2 or more chunks from the ajax callback data
[04:58:17] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: so then use $.get() and update everything manually
[04:58:17] <BBJames> Hi Guys having a bit of a brain block here. I have a ajax function that puts the response on the page, however if a new ajax class has gone out in that time, I would like it to wait for the second response, how would I do that?
[04:58:27] <BBJames> call*
[04:58:44] <alexidoia> there must be something wrong, If I do console.log(myArray), it displays the content of my array, but if do console.log(myArray.length) its always displays 0;
[04:58:52] <SoulRaven> is not posibile to filter the content and extract what i want from that content?
[04:59:06] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: it is, that's what I just told you to do
[04:59:23] <johnkpaul> BBJames: what do you want to do after the second response has finished?
[04:59:25] <SoulRaven> if ajax data has 2 div's, to extract, and make 2 vars that contains each div
[04:59:44] <BBJames> johnkpaul, put the response on that page.
[05:00:01] <alexidoia> anyone ?
[05:00:07] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: in your callback, assuming data is the parameter that is text/html.... $(data).find('#part1).appendTo('wherever')
[05:00:24] <johnkpaul> SoulRaven: $(data).find('#part2').appendTo('wherver2')
[05:00:35] <SoulRaven> thx, i will try now:)
[05:00:36] <Libin> ravenzz R u still there?
[05:00:37] <johnkpaul> BBJames: so you have two ajax calls, and you want to wait until _both_ have finished?
[05:00:43] <johnkpaul> alexidoia: are you sure it's an array?
[05:00:56] <johnkpaul> and, is it over array max length?
[05:01:05] <alexidoia> johnkpaul: yes since I initiate like myArray=new Array();
[05:01:09] <BBJames> Its magento working out totals in the cart johnkpaul, but if its new totals (i,e the customer selected another option) I just want to carry on showing the loading image instead of putting the incorrect totals
[05:01:12] <alexidoia> and I fill it with stuff
[05:01:25] <johnkpaul> ?eval {0:"test"}
[05:01:29] <ravenzz> Libin I'm back
[05:01:31] <bot-t> johnkpaul: SyntaxError: invalid label
[05:01:38] <ravenzz> let me see that

[05:02:05] <johnkpaul> BBJames: Magento? are you sure that it even uses jquery?
[05:02:10] <johnkpaul> magento uses prototype mostly
[05:02:30] <BBJames> johnkpaul it is now, that I decided pro type was a pain in the backside,
[05:03:10] <ravenzz> Libin ok where is the js in question?
[05:03:27] <johnkpaul> so you rewrote all of their ajax to use jquery?
[05:03:27] <johnkpaul> that's a hell of an effort
[05:03:27] <johnkpaul> ok, so you want to look into pipe BBJames
[05:03:27] <johnkpaul> ?pipe @BBJames

[05:04:13] <johnkpaul> ?eval var test = {};test["1"] = "hello";test;
[05:04:14] <bot-t> johnkpaul: {"1": "hello"}
[05:04:16] <Libin> click on different circles and then check the inspect element
[05:04:29] <Libin> when u click the first time there is no error
[05:04:33] <ravenzz> yep ok 1 sec
[05:05:34] <BBJames> johnkpaul not sure that will solve my problem, Ill put a  live version up.
[05:06:21] <johnkpaul> sorry BBJames, I am mistaken

[05:08:08] <ravenzz> uhm ok
[05:09:08] <Libin> thanks for ur time though :)
[05:09:10] <BBJames> Thanks, johnkpaul, still don't think that will solve my problem, because its the same call just more than once, so it can't wait for itself right?
[05:09:17] <Libin> really appreciate it

[05:12:10] <alexidoia> johnkpaul: do you see anything wrong ?
[05:13:09] <BBJames> Thanks anyway I have worked it out now I think, can just use a variable and plus and minus it and only remove the image when it is 0

[06:58:54] <Grundell> what is the easiest way to add a div (containing two spans) inside another div after 4 other elements
[06:59:25] <Milos> Is there a built-in way to handle divs as if they were <option />s?
[06:59:47] <Milos> To submit a form based on selections that are made by clicking on a div, thus making it higlighted and selected, instead of using option boxes?
[06:59:50] <Grundell> no
[07:00:03] <Milos> Do you have any suggestions?
[07:00:37] <Grundell> Oh sorry thought you asked me if i had set up it like that
[07:01:16] <Milos> Haha/
[07:01:21] <Grundell> There is a way i think but seriously new to the whole jQuery so wouldn't be the best person to ask
[07:01:22] <Milos> s/\///
[07:01:35] <Milos> No problem. I'll browse around.
[07:13:01] <Raydiation> i dont get the selector argumetn: $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);
[07:13:12] <Raydiation> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:13:25] <Raydiation> do i always use document as the first argument?
[07:14:15] <Raydiation> basically i have a div into which i load content from the server. in that div is a div#feed_items which has overflow: auto
[07:14:42] <Raydiation> i want to execute a function on div#feed_items scroll
[07:15:16] <Raydiation> $('#feed_items').on('scroll', function(){ works, but doesnt work when i load new content into the div
[07:20:26] <Raydiation> the funny thing is
[07:20:29] <Raydiation> this works with click
[07:20:40] <Raydiation> $('#rightcontent').on('click', '#feed_items', function(){
[07:21:05] <Raydiation> logs to console whenever i click onto an element in #feed_items
[07:21:11] <Raydiation> $('#rightcontent').on('scroll', '#feed_items', function(){
[07:21:14] <Raydiation> does nothing
[07:56:52] <alexidoia> BBonifield: whack your thing if js fiddle, what does that mean ?
[08:01:59] <quuxman> hi, I want to call a function whenever an element matching a selector is created. Sort of like .live(), but there's no event for "element creation", or is there?
[08:02:57] <quuxman> can I say .on('create', function(e){ ... }) // ?
[08:08:41] <quuxman> er, more specifically, $('a, form').on('create', set_targets)
[08:09:03] <yamahaalex37> what function can I use to alert after an open file dialog is closed

[08:20:27] <Krambiorix> hi , does anyone have experience with Fullcalendar?
[08:21:20] <chilversc> Krambiorix: why not just ask a question and if someone knows you might get an answer
[08:24:16] <Teduardo> if i have a var called min_ram defined and I want to use it in another place in the script is it just like this? min: min_ram, or do I need min: $min_ram, or...?
[08:28:02] <Krambiorix> chilversc, that's agains my principles
[08:35:33] <Teduardo> anyone know how I can call a variable I defined earlier?
[08:35:57] <Teduardo> i've tried $var "$var" '$var', etc
[08:36:55] <pifantastic> Teduardo: no $
[08:36:57] <pifantastic> that's PHP
[08:37:18] <pifantastic> "var foo = 1; alert(foo); foo = foo + 1;
[08:39:46] <pifantastic> Teduardo: when you declare a variable using the word "var", that variable only exists within its current scope
[08:39:57] <Teduardo> http://pastebin.ca/index.php
[08:39:59] <pifantastic> Teduardo: if you declare a variable without "var", it exists globally
[08:40:04] <Teduardo> that is a little more useful
[08:40:21] <pifantastic> Teduardo: that is not a unique link
[08:40:30] <Raydiation> i can select an item via data selector: $('#rightcontent [data-id="' + itemid + '"]');
[08:40:40] <Raydiation> can i also use 2 data selectors?
[08:40:49] <quiznilo> http://jsfiddle.net/quiznilo/YUydw/4/ is this a general rule, you cannot use jquery on elements if the id name has a '.' in it?
[08:41:01] <Raydiation> like: $('#rightcontent [data-id="' + itemid + '"][data-feedid="' + feedid + '"]');
[08:41:02] <pifantastic> $('#rightcontent [data-id="' + itemid + '"][data-foo="bar"]');
[08:41:09] <pifantastic> Raydiation: yes
[08:41:11] <Raydiation> ty
[08:41:25] <pifantastic> Raydiation: but next time just try it and see, it takes less time :)
[08:41:44] <pifantastic> quiznilo: it's not a rule, that is not a valid ID
[08:41:47] <Raydiation> xD
[08:41:53] <Teduardo> pifantastic: sorry i'm having the worst luck today http://pastebin.ca/2179254
[08:41:56] <pifantastic> quiznilo: you can only expect jQuery to work with a valid ID
[08:41:58] <quiznilo> [A-Za-z]?
[08:42:05] <quiznilo> roger
[08:42:28] <pifantastic> quiznilo: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#id-selectors
[08:42:46] <quiznilo> thanks for the link and answer... all morning troubleshooting
[08:43:17] <pifantastic> quiznilo: the selector "#selA.q" would match <div id="selA" class="q"></div>
[08:43:42] <quiznilo> okay
[08:44:16] <pifantastic> Teduardo: I need to see more code. Where are you declaring min_ram?
[08:45:44] <Teduardo> oh, right above that first line it says var min_ram = os[1]['min_memory_size'];
[08:46:23] <Teduardo> and I did an alert(min_ram); to make sure it is actually getting set properly and it is thankfully
[08:46:24] <pifantastic> Teduardo: you should log os to the console and see what it is: "console.log(os);"
[08:46:42] <Teduardo> oh.. um well i did alert(min_ram) and it said 256; which is what it should say
[08:47:48] <Teduardo> i just need to know how to tell jquery to replace the string min_ram with the value of min_ram; in php it would just be $min_ram
[08:48:04] <Teduardo> or <?php echo $min_ram; ?> for verbosity
[08:48:41] <quiznilo> and everything works now... so... lunch... thanks again pifantastic
[08:49:10] <pifantastic> Teduardo: just a sec, looking into it
[08:53:12] <pifantastic> Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/PWsc6/
[08:53:23] <pifantastic> Teduardo: that works for me. Are you doing something differently?
[08:53:52] <pifantastic> ahh Teduardo , I bet min_ram is a string, no? It needs to be an integer
[08:54:14] <pifantastic> Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/PWsc6/1/
[08:56:03] <erdos> hey
[08:56:57] <erdos> i've got this site, running through a cms, when i change a select box, the cms automatically disables the select box, changes the value, ajax loads some stuff in the page then enables it again
[08:57:28] <erdos> i'm trying to hook into the change event but it's not registering because it's being disabled elsewhere
[08:57:43] <erdos> this is using $(document).on("change"...
[08:57:56] <erdos> but for some reason $("select").change(function(){}.... works ok
[08:58:09] <pifantastic> erdos: is the other event listener calling stopPropagation(); ?
[08:58:14] <erdos> (only the first time, then because of the ajax, other elements aren't bound
[08:58:27] <erdos> i'm not sure
[08:58:31] <erdos> how can i find out
[08:58:31] <erdos> ?
[08:58:40] <pifantastic> erdos: you need to find the CMS code
[08:58:45] <pifantastic> that is binding to the change event
[08:58:51] <pifantastic> erdos: what CMS is this?
[08:58:54] <erdos> drupal
[08:59:13] <pifantastic> 6 or 7?
[08:59:24] <erdos> 7, with referenced entities
[08:59:39] <erdos> so you change the term in the drop down, parts of the entity change
[08:59:42] <erdos> why would using .change work, but not .on ?
[08:59:45] <pifantastic> https://drupal.org/project/entityreference ?
[09:00:00] <pifantastic> erdos: because one is delegated whereas the other is bound directly to the element
[09:00:12] <erdos> ah ok
[09:00:26] <erdos> um not sure, it's with commerce, 1 sec i'll check
[09:00:59] <erdos> i think the functionality is just in core
[09:01:19] <erdos> or maybe somewhere in commerce, but not that module you mentioned
[09:02:13] <Teduardo> pifantastic: so this? http://jsfiddle.net/PWsc6/3/
[09:02:37] <pifantastic> Teduardo: yes
[09:03:23] <Teduardo> pifantastic: i updated it with the json
[09:04:07] <pifantastic> Teduardo: link?
[09:05:20] <erdos> hmmm, i don't think i'm going to be able to find where this other event listener is defined, i'm not really 100% on the drupals whole ajax system
[09:05:22] <erdos> but
[09:06:13] <erdos> would it be possible to delegate changes to the document, and every time a new element that matches a selector is added i can bind the event straight to that?
[09:06:47] <Teduardo> cool thank you.
[09:07:54] <pifantastic> erdos: to mmy knowledge, that is not possible
[09:08:05] <erdos> balls
[09:10:38] <erdos> hmmm, this sort of works ( http://pastebin.com/GqnmgETx )but it feels like it's goign to be fraught with danger
[09:10:41] <chilversc> shouldn't a live event on the document do that?
[09:11:14] <chilversc> erdos: why not place the live event for change instead of click?
[09:11:36] <chilversc> eg, $(document).on('change', '.form-type-select select', function(...
[09:11:39] <erdos> depreciated as of 1.7, but $(document).on() is now the same
[09:12:13] <erdos> yeah that's what i was doing but some other thing in the guts of drupal was disabling the element before mine could act on it
[09:12:38] <erdos> so the direct bind worked, but the delegation didn't
[09:12:50] <chilversc> erdos: that click handler is just wrong though, it will fire on every click and attach more and more event handlers on every click
[09:12:57] <erdos> yeah i know :P
[09:13:38] <chilversc> erdos: sounds like something is calling .stopPropogation() or the like to supress the event
[09:14:14] <erdos> i guess i'm going to have to dig into drupal
[09:14:20] <pifantastic> chilversc: that was my guess, but a grep through driupal shows no stopPropagation
[09:14:31] <pifantastic> unless it's in some contrib module
[09:15:03] <erdos> what's the syntax for looking through files like that?
[09:15:06] <chilversc> pifantastic: could be, though doesn't returning false from handler function also stop propogation? or does that only prevent default?
[09:15:18] <pifantastic> erdos: you can use grep or ack, ack is better as it is code-aware
[09:15:27] <pifantastic> chilversc: it does, good point
[09:15:41] <chilversc> pifantastic: good luck finding if anything does that though :)
[09:16:02] <erdos> id say there'd be a few of those!
[09:16:13] <pifantastic> ha, yeah there are
[09:16:29] <pifantastic> $ ack "return false" | wc -l
[09:16:29] <pifantastic>      153
[09:16:34] <pifantastic> :(
[09:16:36] <erdos> >_<
[09:16:47] <chilversc> pifantastic: actually, not as many as I was expecting :)
[09:16:48] <erdos> does the change event only apply to when a select box changes? can you hook into changes in the dom?
[09:17:36] <chilversc> erdos: the change event depends on the input, it will also fire for text boxes when the text has changed after they lose focus, etc
[09:18:03] <chilversc> erdos: but nothing for dom changes in terms of adding/removing, etc
[09:18:16] <erdos> dang
[09:18:30] <erdos> hmmm, i guess my only choice is to try to find where the event is registered
[09:18:39] <pifantastic> erdos: dom modification events are only supported it bleeding edge browsers
[09:18:45] <chilversc> erdos: apparently there is something about dom mutation events http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents
[09:18:54] <chilversc> erdos: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4561845/firing-event-on-dom-attribute-change
[09:19:31] <erdos> hmmmm
[09:19:57] <pifantastic> yeah, that's what I was referring to
[09:19:59] <chilversc> erdos: though chrome is quite good for this as well, eg select an element in the DOM and on the right you can see event handlers attached
[09:20:12] <erdos> oh really?
[09:20:15] <chilversc> if you're just debugging that is
[09:20:40] <erdos> dammit! i've been using this dev tools, i didn't notice that!
[09:20:48] <chilversc> chrome also lets you place break points on when an element's attributes are changed, or its children altered
[09:20:51] <pifantastic> erdos: do you have a link we can view?
[09:20:55] <paul_irish> whats the right way to trigger the change special event?  https://github.com/freqdec/fd-slider/issues/22
[09:21:09] <paul_irish>  .change() doesnt seem to run all the handlers, because change is a "special" event internally
[09:21:18] <erdos> sorry it's only on my local machine, and uploading to our crappy shared host takes about 30 mins
[09:21:41] <paul_irish> gotta get with rsync, brah
[09:21:47] <erdos> heh
[09:21:52] <erdos> gotta get a good host!
[09:22:02] <paul_irish> also that.
[09:22:08] <chilversc> paul_irish: I remember having a similar thing with text boxes on older IEs
[09:22:17] <erdos> i've been doing git locally, which is great, if i just had somethign to push to!
[09:22:21] <paul_irish> chilversc: apparently this one only pops for ie9
[09:23:12] <erdos> ok i'm going to try to work my way back through this chrome debugger thingy
[09:23:17] <erdos> thanks for you help guys :)
[09:23:21] <erdos> pifantastic++
[09:23:25] <erdos> chilversc++
[09:23:30] <erdos> @paul_irish++
[09:23:47] <therealklanni> no not
[09:23:51] <therealklanni> not
[09:23:57] <therealklanni> wtf autocorrect
[09:24:02] <therealklanni> bot
[09:24:18] <erdos> lol, do you mean there's no bot in here?
[09:24:24] <paul_irish> yay for chrome debugger thingy!
[09:24:43] <erdos> hehe
[09:25:05] * paul_irish landed a patch to it last week. :)
[09:26:06] <erdos> leet!
[09:26:19] <paul_irish> totes
[09:27:26] <erdos> paul, do you know how i can find where an event listener for an object is coming from?
[09:27:36] <erdos> with the dev tools
[09:27:43] <erdos> since you're all up in the source etc.
[09:28:22] <pifantastic> allupins
[09:28:50] <paul_irish> yup
[09:29:08] <paul_irish> first in Elements tab, select the element and then way down on the righthand side you can see the listeners attached to it
[09:29:10] <chilversc> paul_irish: ah, not sure if its the same thing, but this was the bug I had with the change event http://forum.jquery.com/topic/change-event-not-raised-when-using-datepicker-in-ie8
[09:29:22] <paul_irish> (looks about right, thx chilversc :)
[09:29:30] <paul_irish> erdos: unfortunately they'll probably all be in jquery. but then...
[09:29:44] <paul_irish> you go into Sources and go to event listener breakpoints
[09:29:51] <paul_irish> set a breakpoint on click or whatever
[09:30:01] <paul_irish> and then next time a click event handler is about to fire it'll break.
[09:30:10] <erdos> oh cool
[09:30:14] <paul_irish> again it'll break in jquery but you can Step Out a few times to find your own cod
[09:30:14] <paul_irish> e
[09:30:36] <erdos> ok thanks!
[09:30:41] <erdos> i'll have a stab at it now
[09:31:12] <chilversc> or just look at the call stack in the debugger
[09:31:56] <erdos> hmm, going to have to swap to the non-minified version!
[09:32:04] <chilversc> ah, except it the event hasn't occured yet in that break point
[09:32:04] <pifantastic> erdos: yep
[09:32:16] <chilversc> erdos: or click the "{}" icon in chrome script debugger
[09:32:16] <therealklanni> stack trace for the win
[09:32:17] <pifantastic> erdos: and I'd use the DOM mod breakpoints in devtools
[09:32:41] <chilversc> erdos: it will let you see individual statements at least, though the variable names will still be rubbish
[09:33:15] <erdos> ah sweet!
[09:33:21] <erdos> that's better
[09:33:37] <chilversc> erdos: its good for when you don't care about the minified code, you just want to step out of it
[09:33:52] <chilversc> erdos: though not good if you actually want to tell what the hell is going on in the minified code
[09:34:54] <erdos> heh, not sure i'll be able to understand exactly what's going on in the non-minified code :P
[09:35:11] <pifantastic> erdos: you want to step through until you get to the Drupal code
[09:35:14] <pifantastic> that should be easier to follow
[09:35:24] <erdos> will do
[09:35:35] <erdos> btw, you guys are great :)
[09:35:42] <erdos> thanks for such enthusiastic help
[09:50:29] <erdos> oh boy
[09:50:35] <erdos> so many gaps in my knowledge
[09:50:42] <erdos> might be time to hit the books
[09:51:35] <Krambiorix> hi, i'm a Jquery beginner and i'm testing some stuff . I have a file with all functions. In one of these functions, can i call all other function's functions?
[09:52:47] <alexhendershott> hi all. can anyone take a look at something for me? my function works with getElementById here http://jsbin.com/amudot/18/edit but it doesn't work when I use getElementsByClassName here http://jsbin.com/amudot/19/edit ... can anyone explain why, or what I need to do to get classes working?
[09:54:12] <chilversc> alexhendershott: as the name implies, it can return multiple elements
[09:54:23] <chilversc> alexhendershott: and thus returns an array of elements rather than a single element
[09:54:46] <chilversc> Krambiorix: that's the general idea
[09:55:03] <diverdude> Any recommendations for a javascript framework for presentations?
[09:55:09] <alexhendershott> Hmm, I see, so this is not a correct solution than when I am trying to have multiple ids and or multiple classes
[09:55:26] <chilversc> Krambiorix: though that isn't anything to do with jquery itself, that's javascript and is a fundemental part of structured programming, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming
[09:56:15] <chilversc> alexhendershott: it is a correct solution, but you're going to get back multiple elements, why not use jquery for this since it will handle looping over the elements returned?
[09:56:19] <alexhendershott> My problem is I will have multiple <p>s that need to all run that function, they cannot use the same ID, so my attempt was to convert to classes
[09:57:01] <chilversc> alexhendershott: right, so place a break point on that line in a debugger, and assign the result to a variable
[09:57:31] <chilversc> alexhendershott: ie, var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("number"); then you can inspect what that function is actually returning
[09:57:50] <alexhendershott> ok, I will try that
[09:59:55] <chilversc> alexhendershott: the main point being getElement, vs getElement*s*
[10:06:23] <erdos> wertygdfjghkrgh brain broken
[10:06:25] <erdos> bed time
[10:06:28] <erdos> later dudes
[10:08:38] <Bennit> $('#properties > input') should select all nested input fields in the #properties container, right? (no matter how deeply nested)
[10:08:43] <Bennit> it doesn't :(
[10:10:00] <Bennit> the container is a table, perhaps that has something to do with it?
[10:12:05] <Bennit> http://jsfiddle.net/edDVX/ # an example
[10:14:52] <Bennit> I could attach a class property to the input field, but I wonder deep nest- selection doesn't work?
[10:16:17] <Bennit> ah, > only selects the first descendant, read over that
[10:16:21] <Bennit> nvm! :)
[10:21:53] <stuffmc> Is the something "wrong" with an element having "13:00:00:00:00:00" as an ID?
[10:22:08] <stuffmc> I can't select it :D
[10:24:02] <crankharder> auto complete doesn't work in latest chrome?
[10:24:03] <stuffmc> OK
[10:24:03] <stuffmc> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:24:04] <crankharder> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:24:18] <stuffmc> If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\
[10:26:38] <Krambiorix> chilversc, so would the following work? http://pastebin.com/2T7MNbFF
[10:29:34] <Somatt> is there a way to get an event triggered whenever an element changes height ?
[10:29:41] <crankharder> autocomplete is broken for me, on the jquery ui site, in ffx, safari, and chrome... any my projects.  any ideas?
[10:29:58] <crankharder> working for anyone else?
[10:33:46] <Krambiorix> guys, would the following be possible in js/jquery ? http://pastebin.com/2T7MNbFF
[10:36:52] <dabear> Krambiorix: yes and no
[10:37:02] <Krambiorix> dabear, can you elaborate?
[10:37:07] <dabear> first of all, all function definitins requires parens
[10:37:12] <dabear> function foo(){}
[10:37:20] <dabear> you don't have that there
[10:37:42] <dabear> second, you would have to make the variable ac accessible to function b
[10:38:06] <Krambiorix> dabear, how can i do the second?
[10:38:06] <dabear> and then use ac(), not callme()
[10:38:31] <dabear> why would you ever have to?
[10:39:02] <dabear> var ac outside the a function
[10:39:05] <dabear> then do a()
[10:39:17] <dabear> which will populate the contents of ac
[10:39:27] <dabear> then ac is available to all functions including b
[10:40:16] <Krambiorix> dabear, so in general the functions in a function can't be called from another function in another function ?
[10:40:46] <dabear> functions are scoped, yes
[10:41:12] <Krambiorix> dabear, okay thanks!
[10:43:34] <Krambiorix> dabear, but if you pass the object to the other function, you can call the object's functions, right?
[10:43:55] <dabear> yep
[10:45:26] <Krambiorix> dabear, ... and you can't instantiate a function?
[10:45:33] <dabear> Krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope may be a good read
[10:45:41] <dabear> instantiate?
[10:45:57] <Krambiorix> like in php : $foo = new Bar();
[10:46:31] <dabear> the new operator is supported in js
[10:46:42] <Krambiorix> ok
[10:47:20] <dabear> Krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new
[10:47:31] <Krambiorix> dabear, one last question: if i have "this"  in a function like var t = this;  -> what is the this then?
[10:47:33] <Krambiorix> thx
[10:47:49] <dabear> huh?
[10:47:56] <dabear> t would be this
[10:48:04] <Krambiorix> yes, but what is it then?
[10:48:06] <dabear> what this is depends on the context on which it was called
[10:48:35] <dabear> jquerty binds this into the dom element where the ervent happened
[10:48:40] <Krambiorix> dabear, could it be the function that has called the other function?
[10:48:41] <dabear> event*
[10:48:43] <therealklanni> this means the current scope
[10:48:52] <Krambiorix> yes
[10:49:24] <therealklanni> which is not what you'd expect when you're inside a while, foreach, etc
[10:50:02] <Krambiorix> dabear, in fullcalendars code i see: AgendaView.call(t, element, calendar, 'upcomingEvents');  -> Agendaview is not defined in the function. How can it call other function's functions like that then?
[10:50:35] <dabear> AgendaView may be defined elsewhere, in other js files
[10:50:48] <therealklanni> the function is global
[10:51:35] <dabear> .call is special in that it sets the this context as its first parameter
[10:51:35] <b-ot> dabear, memorised “call”.
[10:51:42] <dabear> bha
[10:51:51] <dabear> b-ot: silly bot
[10:52:02] <Krambiorix> it's in the same file function AgendaView(element, calendar, viewName)
[10:52:41] <dabear> inside of that function, "this" would be the same as "t"
[10:53:56] <Krambiorix> dabear, yeah but i mean, why is it being called like that? (Agendaview.....) Agendaview is not defined as a variable in the function
[10:55:33] <dabear> right, in contrast to php, variables, functions are accessed first locally, then in the parent scope if they don't exist in the current scope
[10:55:57] <Krambiorix> dabear, with parent scope you mean the callee function
[10:55:58] <dabear> assuming you are using "var" and not "let"(let is not very well supported)
[10:55:59] <Krambiorix> right?
[10:56:26] <dabear> there will be multiple parent scopes
[10:56:33] <dabear> the top scope is the window
[10:57:05] <dabear> if you have one js file with one statement: function foo(){}
[10:57:23] <Krambiorix> dabear, ok so it's possible to call functions from other functions by traversing to parents and syblings and stuff?
[10:57:34] <dabear> then you can access that js function in any other js file, with either foo() or window.foo()
[10:58:07] <dabear> Krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=function+scope
[10:59:14] <dabear> there is no sibling scope, only parent scopes
[11:00:20] <Krambiorix> dabear, okay, thanks for your help, i'll take a look at those pages
[11:00:42] <sviatovigt> Hi
[11:01:11] <dabear> hola
[11:01:49] <Krambiorix> dabear, ok now really the last question: following is a parameter to a function : [name, thisObj || t].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2)  -> what the hell does that mean?
[11:02:26] <Krambiorix> [name, thisObj || t ] is probably an array of name and if thisObj is not null, it takes t
[11:02:46] <Krambiorix> but how can you concat an array and what is it concatenating with?!
[11:03:03] <therealklanni> it's just taking the second argument passed to that function and adding to an array
[11:03:53] <dabear> Array.prototype.slice.call is used to create a real array
[11:03:58] <therealklanni> falsy is what would make it take the value of t
[11:04:04] <dabear> "arguments" is an array like object
[11:04:23] <therealklanni> not only null
[11:04:26] <Krambiorix> dabear,  this is the whole code : http://pastebin.com/sVyb3mAR
[11:05:08] <Krambiorix> so the result would be an array of either thisObj or t ?
[11:06:00] <therealklanni> and name
[11:06:10] <therealklanni> and whatever arg 2 is
[11:06:45] <luchenbill> (function () { alert('hi'); }());
[11:07:04] <dabear> that is some seriously fcked up code, Krambiorix:p
[11:07:20] <Krambiorix> :p it's fullcalendar's code
[11:08:04] <dabear> drunkcalendar's code*
[11:09:27] <dabear> ?jseval "hey @ " + ( "llibnehcul".split("").reverse().join(""))
[11:09:43] <Krambiorix> :p
[11:09:44] <dabear> ?eval "hey @ " + ( "llibnehcul".split("").reverse().join(""))
[11:10:06] <dabear> what's wrong with the bot today?
[11:10:29] <therealklanni> >> "test"
[11:10:45] <therealklanni> .. "test"
[11:10:59] <therealklanni> I thought there was another not
[11:11:04] <therealklanni> bot
[11:11:26] <dabear> a not bot?
[11:11:33] <dabear> a bot which is not there?
[11:11:41] <dabear> it seems so:p
[11:11:45] <therealklanni> exactly
[11:34:25] <Krambiorix> is there some kind of function to see all functions of an object?
[11:37:57] <blinry> hey! i have: "<li>some <b>text</b> here <ul> ... </ul> </li>" and would like to transform this to "<li><span class="node">some <b>text</b> here </span><ul> ... </ul> </li>" - that is, to manipulate the portion of the <li> *before* the <ul>-child. can you think of a way to do this?
[11:37:58] <gilligan_> var funcs; for (var property in someObject) { if ( typeof property === 'function') funcs.push(property) }; .. something like that i guess
[11:42:10] <Krambiorix> gilligan_, or the name of the object/function ? The object itself is being passed to the function
[11:46:03] <Krambiorix> well at least something...
[11:46:06] <dabear> Krambiorix: use the webkit developer console or firebug
[11:46:18] <Krambiorix> dabear, i have firebug
[11:46:19] <dabear> just type the name of the variable and enter
[11:46:38] <Krambiorix> dabear, in console?
[11:46:54] <dabear> yep
[11:46:56] <jrockjiggz> i'm using var El = $('el');   thne El[0].attr();  but i'm given function attr does not exist http://jsfiddle.net/Qyx8x/
[11:47:25] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know why? do i need to use eg()
[11:47:28] <blinry> this answer solves my problem: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5363461
[11:47:34] <jrockjiggz> *eq
[11:47:35] <dabear> EL.attr() @ jrockjiggz
[11:48:02] <Krambiorix> dabear, nothing... just the usual error:  calendar.eventClick is not a function
[11:48:13] <jrockjiggz> dabear: EL[0].attr() doesnt work :(
[11:48:27] <dabear> jrockjiggz: NO, EL.attr()
[11:48:34] <dabear> not [0]
[11:49:11] <jrockjiggz> dabear: but i need to use [0]
[11:49:13] <dabear> or .eq(0) ofc
[11:49:19] <jrockjiggz> dabear: .eq() works..
[12:04:00] <nveid> hey.. I want to use jquery UI, more specifically the connectwith: part of it..  However I don't want the items actually removed from the list on the right, is there a way to do that?
[12:04:22] <alexhendershott> Hi all. I got further with my bug but I've encountered another one. If you look here http://jsbin.com/amudot/23/edit you will see my paragraphs names "number" are adding together. If you remove one of those <p>s the conversion I wrote works fine, it just doesn't work with multiple... can anyone help me out?
[12:04:43] <nveid> Basically in my mind I have two lists..  A list on the left that gets items from the right, it can get the items multiple times.  And when items from the left are moved to the right they don't actually add though, but disappear from the left
[12:05:44] <nveid> I'm sure this idea has to of been done before
[12:07:00] <stuffmc> so I have this
[12:07:44] <stuffmc> #f6ed42832cf9d64ebba19109c2009d85, #13\\:00\\:00\\:00\\:00\\:00"
[12:08:20] <stuffmc> and when trying to select I only get #f6ed42832cf9d64ebba19109c2009d85 and not #13:00:00:00:00:00 -- any idea why?
[12:10:02] <mitzev_> hi alll
[12:10:17] <mitzev_> what's the easiest way to acheive a more/less content area
[12:10:21] <mitzev_> toggle of some sort
[12:10:54] <mitzev_> there would be a "more" link, that when clicked would reveal more text. the "more" link would then be changed to "less"
[12:11:00] <LSshock> Hi all, i have a string like "Messages (1)" and i have been searching around with google but so far i have not found how i can detect if there is a number in it. (so detect the number in () because if there is no new message it simply says "Messages")
[12:22:46] <LSshock> *sound of crickets*
[12:29:31] <mitzev_> sound of cicadas
[12:36:45] <ravenzz> stuffmc it is a bug in the selector engine
[12:36:50] <ravenzz> i think
[12:37:12] <stuffmc> really?!
[12:37:14] <Afflicto> How do I animate the "left" css property?
[12:38:12] <lesyork> Having some trouble animating a scrollTop - seems to move to a different place each time if the time is changed (say from 25 to 2.5 seconds) - anyone got history with this?
[12:38:21] <Afflicto>  nevermind -- figured it out :P
[12:38:50] <stuffmc> wow yeah as ravenzz says on #css this works: $("#f6ed42832cf9d64ebba19109c2009d85").add("#13\\:00\\:00\\:00\\:00\\:00")
[12:39:04] <ravenzz> stuffmc http://jsfiddle.net/EBZBc/ this way would work
[12:39:23] <ravenzz> anyway remember that #13:00:00 is an invalid ID
[12:39:28] <ravenzz> it cannot start with a number.
[12:39:35] <ravenzz> so go and fix that
[12:49:27] <alexhendershott> Can anyone help me with a number conversion problem? If you look here http://jsbin.com/amudot/23/edit my number conversion does what it is supposed to do. However, if you add another <p class="facet-count">12345</p> aka another instance of facet-count...the number conversion stops working and somehow starts to add things together. Can anyone help me get this working right?
[12:50:02] <snabe> is it just me or has 1.8.0 changed the behaviour in IE when $(document).ready() is called? I get it to be called a bit to early
[12:53:32] <ravenzz> alex1 why do you "coerce to string" and then che if it is >= of a number?
[12:54:01] <ravenzz> alexhendershott
[12:54:02] <ravenzz> sorry
[12:54:12] <alexhendershott> Hi there
[12:54:20] <ravenzz> convert it to, number
[12:54:28] <ravenzz> do your math and than return to fixed

[14:55:47] <Atty> What Im i doing wrong on the modal here?
[15:07:30] <alexidoia> do you see anything wrong with that : <button onclick="window.location='http://akas.imdb.com/title/tt1258189/'">go</button>
[15:15:00] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/52gF2/2/ - I got this pinterest.com sticky header + Highcharts chart.
[15:15:03] <abletony84> But why does the sticky header code mess up the chart when I change var $stickyElement = $("header") to some element that's not within that document, i.e. header#elsewhere?
[15:21:12] <lpin> dabear ended up with this http://pastebin.com/j6kb2czu
[15:21:59] <lpin> seems to works well
[15:24:12] <dabear> lpin: nice
[15:24:43] <dabear> lpin: so what's the difference between contains and econtains?
[15:24:48] <lpin> dabear don't know if there is a cleaner version
[15:25:21] <lpin> <div>foobar<div> <div>foo</div>
[15:25:27] <lpin> contains matches both
[15:25:39] <lpin> econtains only second one
[15:25:52] <lpin> if i use foo in the selector ofc
[15:26:00] <lpin> forgot  important part :)
[15:26:29] <dabear> right
[15:27:00] <lpin> also old contains wasn't case sesitive
[15:27:00] <dabear> .filter( function(){ return this.innerHTML == avar})
[15:27:03] <lpin> one is
[15:27:20] <lpin> new*
[15:27:30] <dabear> using filters is faster and more cleaner if you ask me, though
[15:28:26] <lpin> where can i take a look?
[15:30:22] <dabear> where you can take a look into my subjective opinion?:P
[15:30:40] <lpin> yes :)
[15:30:52] <lpin> never used filters
[15:31:48] <lpin> oh basic api
[15:31:49] <Krambiorix> hi guys, how can this function be rewritten? http://pastebin.com/rzmmuaTm

[15:33:42] <|PiP|> how can i execute the native submit of a form?
[15:33:48] <lpin> dabear got it, yeah using .filter() is indeed a cleaner solution
[15:33:58] <lpin> thank you
[15:34:42] <Krambiorix> dabear, hmm true
[15:35:29] <dabear> |PiP|: get the form element, using .get(0) then .submit() on that
[15:57:24] <nveid> is it possible to use connectsWith sortable but not make the originating list sortable?  But just drag/droppable to the new list to be sorted?
[16:02:09] <nveid> and also.. not making the items actually get removed from the list its moving fro
[16:02:19] <nveid> I just wantt o use teh connectsWith sortable part… to the other list, not the originating list

[16:14:19] <Atty> understand
[16:14:22] <Atty> one sec
[16:16:38] <sahbeewah> it's a bad idea to chain .parent
[16:17:06] <sahbeewah> in this case it isn't working because your first .parent is a span tag, not a td as you would think
[16:17:20] <sahbeewah> use .closest('tr')
[16:19:32] <Atty> same thing sahbeewah
[16:19:47] <noregret> I have $('#ContentASendEmailForm').append('<div class="error">'+ result.data + '</div>').hide().fadeIn('slow') how can I make the appended text delay for a couple of secs then disappear ?

[16:52:11] <nveid> guess.. better yet is remove a sortable when moved outside of a div
[16:52:15] <nveid> when its released
[16:54:48] <nveid> think i found something
[17:00:54] <adlwalrus> is the target origin in window.postmessage optional?

[18:19:46] <nveid> coldhead: even
[18:20:27] <nveid> Has the question in detail as well as the jsfiddle there
[18:21:59] <Syed> hello guys ...
[18:24:17] <nveid> coldhead: Most notably look at the console log when you drag the items on teh leftside outside of its div
[18:24:26] <nveid> I don't understand why whats happening is happening
[18:46:00] <coldhead> nveid: i am taking a look now
[18:46:12] <nveid> thanks
[18:48:06] <nveid> I'm going after a sort of mac dock effect.. You know how when you drag an item off of the dock it disappears
[18:48:40] <coldhead> so you want it to work as soon as you remove it from the container
[18:48:43] <coldhead> during the drag
[18:48:52] <coldhead> before it is dropped?
[18:49:03] <nveid> No, as soon as mouseup
[18:49:14] <nveid> When you mouseup outside of the container it disappears
[18:49:53] <nveid> However, the mouseenter/mouseleave events aren't triggering right which is visible from watching teh console log during the dragging process
[18:50:38] <coldhead> i expect the binds aren't working in the start handler because you are actually dragging ui.helper
[18:50:44] <coldhead> instead of the actual element
[18:50:49] <coldhead> at least i think that's how it works
[18:50:55] <coldhead> i kind of hate UI and avoid it
[18:51:09] <coldhead> are these solutions any use? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1076998/jquery-drag-and-drop-question
[18:53:07] <nveid> not sure if it will work or not.. some draggable methods don't work with sortable, and you can't make a sortable a draggable as well
[18:53:50] <coldhead>  i'd give it a shot, these use methods i would expect would be common
[18:54:04] <coldhead> otherwise your best bet is to ask a UI expert like ajpiano
[18:54:18] <coldhead> ajpiano: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1076998/jquery-drag-and-drop-question little help?
[19:03:07] <nveid> droppable didn't work for me.. i tried tha tin a jsfiddle
[19:06:22] <coldhead> i guess it makes sense, sortable() is more for sorting
[19:06:31] <coldhead> what about this fix which is too long for me to read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6582328/detecting-if-a-jquery-ui-sortable-item-is-touching-outside-of-its-container
[19:06:45] <coldhead> the question sounds like he's going for a similar effect to yours
[19:07:06] <xnotte> why does none of my .click works ? http://jsfiddle.net/2XUh3/

[19:08:53] <rmurphey> i was just going to say that
[19:09:01] <rmurphey> now i hate you
[19:10:37] <xnotte> humm thanks
[19:10:42] <xnotte> :)
[19:10:58] <xnotte> but it's not working in my real case, and jquery is working so i have to see whats going on
[19:11:10] <coldhead> mr murphey, i am /so/ sorry
[19:11:22] <coldhead> i will make sure this never happens again
[19:11:50] <coldhead> does this work
[19:11:58] <coldhead> oh god i don't know how to IRC
[19:12:30] <rmurphey> at least we both know how to op ourselves
[19:12:32] <rmurphey> so there's that
[19:12:45] <coldhead> BUT TO WHAT END!!!
[19:14:20] <coldhead> nveid: i bet rmurphey knows how to fix your UI problems
[19:14:48] <nveid> oh?
[19:14:58] <nveid> one sec.. going to play al ittle more with my fiddle and see if i can get it
[19:15:37] <rmurphey> i'm afraid coldhead is playing a terrible joke on you, nveid
[19:15:44] <rmurphey> ui is the opposite of my forte
[19:15:54] <nveid> darn, :(
[19:20:33] <xnotte> coldhead: if i paste the $('a.lists').click in firebug console it works, but after making a $('#content').load(..) and THEN click on the a.lists link does nothing, maybe after the .load() it does not triggers the ('a.lists').click ?
[19:20:57] <ezio> anyone seen lindsaymac around?
[19:21:21] <shoky> nveid: what's wrong with Carth's reply to your question?
[19:22:02] <ezio> does anyone have lindsaymac's site .. she posted before
[19:23:58] <nveid> shoky: sorry I missed the question
[19:24:17] <shoky> nveid: i mean his reply to your question on SO
[19:24:33] <nveid> oh.. let me check if there was an update or not
[19:24:42] <shoky> he says to do this basically: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kQmWt/5/
[19:24:45] <shoky> and that works
[19:25:20] <rmurphey> xnotte: what is your .load() doing?
[19:25:34] <rmurphey> can you create a more complete example?
[19:25:39] <nveid> ahh i haven't tried that.. Awesome, i'll check it out
[19:25:51] <nveid> beautiful
[19:26:01] <rmurphey> chances are your $('a.lists') selection isn't selecting the things that you're loading
[19:26:03] <nveid> Thanks shoky for letting me know someone answered it :)
[19:26:58] <rmurphey> you may want to try event delegation, i.e. $('#content').on('click', 'a.lists', function() { ... });
[19:29:45] <xnotte> thanks rmurphey, it was that problem. coldhead gave me that hint like you and it worked. Thanks
[19:29:53] <patrick99e99> gf3 !!!!!!

[20:49:46] <Milos|Work> item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection').whose_children_do_not_contain('.choice-hover').first();
[20:49:49] <Milos|Work> how could I do this?
[20:50:13] <Milos|Work> I need to select the parents of the children who do not contain a class
[20:51:39] <Milos|Work> possible as a chain or do I need to make a few if statements?
[20:53:09] <Milos|Work> am I possibly after children('.subsection > .choice-hover')?
[20:53:20] <Milos|Work> it gave me undefined, but I'll try see exactly what it's doing.
[21:05:02] <shoky> Milos|Work: you can try item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection').children(':not(:has(.choice-hover)').parent().first()
[21:05:20] <Milos|Work> thanks I've really been throwing my head around with this one
[21:05:27] <Milos|Work> I'll see if I can work with what you've given
[21:05:48] <shoky> or item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection > :not(:has(.choice-hover)').parent().first()
[21:05:57] <Milos|Work> that looks like what I've been looking for
[21:06:03] <Milos|Work> I'll give it a shot
[21:06:30] <shoky> oops forgot closing parens in the selctor
[21:06:36] <Milos|Work> no probs
[21:07:24] <shoky> actually the last one won't work i think
[21:07:26] <shoky> my bad
[21:08:02] <Milos|Work> it gave me undefined, I'll try the first one :)
[21:08:24] <shoky> where are you getting undefined?
[21:08:36] <Milos|Work> I do .attr('id') at the end
[21:08:44] <shoky> ah
[21:08:45] <Milos|Work> otherwise I get an object back, not sure which
[21:08:52] <shoky> do console.log first
[21:08:57] <Milos|Work> alright
[21:08:57] <shoky> to see if you have something to .attr('id') on
[21:09:02] <shoky> always.
[21:10:09] <shoky> if the first one doesnt work, start breaking the chain to see which part didnt get what you expected
[21:10:16] <Milos|Work> it kind of works
[21:10:28] <Milos|Work> I get a div, but not the right one :P
[21:10:35] <Milos|Work> I'll see if I can get it right
[21:11:04] <Milos|Work> yeah it's giving me all three .subsections regardless of whether or not one if its children has .choice-hover
[21:11:12] <Milos|Work> (without .first())
[21:11:28] <shoky> closed the missing paren in the selector?
[21:11:32] <Milos|Work> console.log($item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection').children(':not(:has(.choice-hover))').parent());
[21:13:21] <shoky> Milos|Work: what did you mean by "children who do not contain a class" ?
[21:13:35] <Milos|Work> here's an example:
[21:14:39] <Milos|Work> ok, writing HTML here is not easy to read, I'll pastebin it
[21:17:04] <Milos|Work> shoky, http://bpaste.net/show/RqkqmpVrxh2Tq0ZbRrGK/
[21:17:29] <shoky> ok
[21:17:51] <Milos|Work> shoky, here you can see that subsection #1, choice one, has been selected. So I proceed to slideDown() the following subsection, but if there are 3 then I need to know which to slide down
[21:18:05] <Milos|Work> and you cannot skip subsections.
[21:18:56] <ScottG> How would I go about getting two specific child elements (elem1 and elem2) given a jquery object. In other words: $(element).<what goes here?>
[21:19:53] <shoky> Milos|Work: so,  item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection').children(':not(.choice-hover)').parent()
[21:20:48] <shoky> Milos|Work: er no
[21:20:57] <Milos|Work> It still shows me 3 :(
[21:21:09] <shoky> Milos|Work: so here it should only get the 2nd subsection?
[21:22:14] <shoky> Milos|Work: item.closest('.stage-content').children('.subsection:not(:has(.choice-hover))').parent()
[21:23:02] <Milos|Work> that one went too high, it returned stage-content
[21:23:15] <Milos|Work> perhaps not possible to do in a chain?
[21:23:15] <shoky> oops yeah, remove the .parent()
[21:23:19] <Milos|Work> oh
[21:23:33] <Milos|Work> wow
[21:23:39] <Milos|Work> I'm impressed shoky!
[21:23:45] <shoky> ;p
[21:24:03] <Milos|Work> That's exactly what I need. Reason I couldn't do it right was because I haven't used these colon operators before.
[21:24:10] <Milos|Work> That's jQuery, not CSS right?
[21:24:28] <shoky> :has is jquery yeah
[21:24:32] <shoky> :not is CSS i think
[21:24:41] <Milos|Work> what's the different between :has and $.has?
[21:24:59] <Milos|Work> jquery has a not of its own
[21:25:05] <shoky> one is a method and one is a selector, other than that they serve the same purpose
[21:25:10] <Milos|Work> I see
[21:26:41] <Milos|Work> thanks a lot shoky, you have made this a reality! :D
[21:26:56] <shoky> ;]
[21:49:09] <luchenbill> i'm trying to write a simple validator using jquery (im a noob), could someone please advise? http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/10/ idk why the fields are always returning null for a value even if something is typed into the input's
[21:52:27] <luchenbill> oops I guess that's not the issue... however I don't think i'm doing the regex right?
[21:52:38] <luchenbill> update 11
[21:53:57] <luchenbill> ahh doh I think I need to use match() or something?
[22:02:43] <luchenbill> anyone? i seem to be struggling
[22:03:23] <luchenbill> I tried if (namez !== namez.match(nameRegEx)) { } and nothing :(
[22:04:17] <LuisLeite> luchenbill, check this if it helps

[22:05:43] <coldhead> ?mdc match
[22:05:45] <luchenbill> yeah I looked at a few of em

[22:32:34] <luchenbill> can anyone advise? http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/12/
[23:04:41] <luchenbill> seems like I got it working, but the logic is reversed... I tried doing a if (!nameRegEx) { } and it's not working, however if I take the ! off, everything BUT my string works... http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/17/
[23:07:37] <jrockjiggz> luchenbill: http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/18/
[23:09:52] <jrockjiggz> luchenbill: your !nameRegEx could be anything, depending on the match.. your going to have two results: !true and !false.  so better to:  (nameRegEx == true)
[23:14:36] <jrockjiggz> could anyone assist with bbq plugin? I'm trying to nest multiple tabs using one binding: $(window).bind( 'hashchange')
[23:15:42] <jrockjiggz> oh nm, i figured it out
[23:15:54] <luchenbill> damn i still can't get it
[23:16:00] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/19/
[23:18:49] <jrockjiggz> luchenbill: http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/20/
[23:19:23] <jrockjiggz> luchenbill: sorry, add a ! to that
[23:19:42] <jrockjiggz> (!namez.match(nameRegEx))
[23:19:56] <luchenbill> nah still doesnt work man
[23:19:58] <luchenbill> :(
[23:20:05] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/21/
[23:20:19] <jrockjiggz> works for me
[23:20:37] <luchenbill> but add a number or a special chr
[23:20:41] <luchenbill> it does not throw the alert
[23:20:53] <luchenbill> so i'm guessing the regex is not correct somehow
[23:22:05] <luchenbill> which brings us right back to where I had it
[23:22:12] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/22/ is completely fine, except it's reversed logic
[23:22:21] <luchenbill> every string is okay except a-zA-z
[23:22:34] <luchenbill> but adding a ! to the test does not fix it
[23:22:54] <luchenbill> oh yeah, I guess it did
[23:22:55] <luchenbill> wtf
[23:22:58] <jrockjiggz> luchenbill:  if (!namez.match(nameRegEx)) {
[23:23:03] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/23/

[23:32:39] <luchenbill> I think I want to create an error array to push errors to, to avoide multiple boxes?
[23:38:51] <rauchy> So what is the de-facto standard for front-end validations nowadays?
[23:41:09] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/34/ I know .length is not what i want.. is there a way to get the size of the array?
[23:43:22] <luchenbill> hmmm
[23:43:22] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/35/
[23:45:42] <luchenbill> any way to stop this from doing both checks? http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/37/
[23:45:55] <luchenbill> I mean both checks on both inputs?
[23:55:08] <jayd3e> any way to get fixed elements to move with another fixed element that has slideDown called on it?
[23:55:18] <luchenbill> is this a correct way to do validation?
[23:55:19] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/40/
[23:57:18] <dr0id> can I set value of jquery slider in decimal, something like 4.5 ? just to simulate a fake progress ?
