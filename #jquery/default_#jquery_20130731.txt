[00:23:13] <amo> is there multiple screen size and multiple density screen problem in jquery mobile app?
[00:46:05] <ziikutv> Hello
[00:46:09] <ziikutv> My goal is learn Node.
[00:46:35] <ziikutv> Is it okay if I have no knowledge of Javascript and just jump on Jquery, learn that and then just move on to node?
[00:47:24] <Nemurenai> ziikutv, yeah, that could work I think...
[00:47:51] <amitprakash> Hi, for all elements matching a selector, how do retrive their html() in a list?
[00:47:51] <Nemurenai> But practice particularly on using callbacks and anonymous functions. Node is pretty heavy on that.
[00:49:10] <fella6s> if it suits you then why not? I was handed the dojo toolkit when i started working even if i had little to none javascript knowledge. Its not that hard if you learn some principles and know some language before
[00:49:32] <dubphil> Hello, I currently code an ajax chat and I face something very strange and difficult to debug, this code http://jsfiddle.net/PTXzz/ stops working when two diiferent user are connected: When 1 user its connected it is ok, when a second user connects, it works for him, but its stop working for the first connected user. what can i do to debug this ?
[00:49:38] <fella6s> And now i'm using jquery tho
[00:50:12] <ziikutv> THe Noders said I should just learn Javascript as the DOM isn't that hard anymore and i might not need Jquery by the time I finish learning Node.
[00:50:12] <amitprakash> i.e. something similar to x = []; $(selector).each(function(self) { x.push($(self).html())});
[00:52:59] <fella6s> ziikutv, you asked at ##javascript some book and i'm too tired to identify now so heres something someone there recommended: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[00:55:31] <amitprakash> sorry.. x = []; $.each($('table td.waybill'),function(k, elem) { x.push($(elem).html());});
[00:55:39] <amitprakash> is there a better way to do this?
[00:56:00] <ziikutv> fella6s:  Wow thanks, the author says on that page that he has the revised version on amazon does that mean the free zipped html has some errors etc?
[01:00:21] <resting> what is the best method for recursive javascript calls? example to update time every second. setTimeout?
[01:00:30] <noregret> where is it best to write query code, in the <head> or <body>?
[01:03:13] <dubphil> resting: setInterval(func, [time in ms])
[01:03:34] <Gregoric> Hello, could someone read my topic and decide if my aim is even achievable? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/pause-form-submission-for-an-ajax-call
[01:03:36] <resting> dubphil: thanks..
[01:03:50] <linear4-> holy shit. I just tried watching porn on the new IE11. It's amazingly smooth
[01:04:15] <dubphil> linear4-: geek :)
[01:04:57] <fella5s> pron or ie11
[01:07:24] <fella5s> Gregoric, are you doing $("#id").submit(function(e){...", i'm not sure but you could try to save "this" somewhere else and call "this".submit after ajax call is success?
[01:08:11] <dubphil> dubphil: both, geeks always wants to make their code working on ie
[01:09:47] <Gregoric> fella5s, yes, I wanted to execute the script on this form. Also, I am not any kind of professional, most of the code was suggested to me or I had found it.So how should I save the 'this'? As a variable or object or--?
[01:16:55] <fella5s> Gregoric, you could do something like "var that = this;" and then on "$ajax({...success:function(data){that.submit())..."
[01:17:24] <Gregoric> Okay, I'll try it
[01:17:33] <fella5s> that could work
[01:17:51] <fella5s> have no idea if it will tho
[01:19:08] <boof> does anyone know of a plugin
[01:19:18] <boof> where you can hover-over a form
[01:19:26] <boof> and it shows you a couple of options?
[01:19:34] <boof> that are clickable
[01:19:39] <Gregoric> fella5s, you have read through my code that I had provided in the post?
[01:20:15] <thomasbritton> boof: couldn't u just show them options upon hover of the form with a simple slideToggle ?
[01:20:38] <fella5s> no i did not
[01:21:26] <Gregoric> fella5s I have / var $form = $(this); / and then / ...success:function(data){that.submit());...
[01:21:28] <fluffypony> ola…I'm trying to trigger an interval refresh of all images that are class imgrefreshable in a page by adding a d.getTime() GET variable to it…so two questions: how do I step through every element that belongs to that class, and how do I reuse the current img src attribute but just change that get var?
[01:21:45] <Gregoric> fella5s and it does not work ;s
[01:21:57] <fella5s> remove $() around this
[01:22:17] <Gregoric> Oh sorry that's really not the same, right
[01:24:27] <amitprakash> anyone? :(
[01:25:22] <Gregoric> fella5s It does not work. I have this.submit() in my code so it should do the thing, but does not - same as your idea :s Thanks for help, tho - if you have any otehr suggestions, they are welcome :)
[01:33:17] <fella5s> Gregoric, check this, it seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/s5er2/1/

[01:34:49] <fella5s> second request is fired instantly after first success
[01:34:51] <TitoN> hi why doesnt this work on a input id? jQuery('input#billing:firstname').removeClass('.required-entry');
[01:35:34] <TitoN> id="billing:firstname"
[01:37:24] <fella5s> TitoN, escape : with \\
[01:37:46] <fella5s> so your selector is 'input#billing\\:firstname'
[01:37:46] <TitoN> ahhh doh thx :D
[01:38:55] <Gregoric> fell5s thanks, I will try to customize that but the problem is the script you have provided, sends AJAX call with the same values as are in the form and I wante them to be a bit parsed before sending + I'd like one more to be added (that is IP)
[01:39:19] <Gregoric> I will try it out and come back in some time, tho. Thanks :)
[01:48:12] <Grundell> So i have a bit of a problem atm. I'm trying to lift in a javascript in to wordpress (asking the same qusetion in WP cuse in don't know where it belongs to be honest). I get the error message TypeError: this.$el is undefined... what is it that im missing? http://jsfiddle.net/NTGvQ/
[01:49:27] <resting> if i have a page that has setInterval(foo, 1000), and foo returns a page that has the same function ie. setInterval(foo, 1000), is there some stacking going on here?
[01:49:40] <[E]sc> can someone tell me why this code isn't resetting the timeout counter? http://pastebin.com/30cJVEkD
[02:03:25] <themojowill> morning is there an event I can attach to when a dropdown is selected. change() isn't any good as it picks up when the items are changed (loading via ajax based on previous dropdown)
[02:15:28] <SargoDarya> themojowill: then just bind to the event after it has loaded?
[02:15:50] <themojowill> SargoDarya ?
[02:16:38] <SargoDarya> Well, bind change, but wait until the items are loaded and then bind to it.
[02:16:47] <SargoDarya> That was your problem with change right?
[02:17:59] <themojowill> yeah not sure how I would go about that though
[02:24:20] <Anticom> hi guys
[02:24:45] <themojowill> SargoDarya, how would I do that?
[02:25:12] <themojowill> do it in ajax:success?
[02:25:52] <Anticom> I'm still having massive problems, getting full calendar to work with other plugins. When i place the other plugins after the full calendar include i don't get any error. However if i include the other plugin (currently trying toastr) first and full calendar afterwards, i'm getting "$.fullCalendar() is not a function". In both cases the calendar won't render.
[02:25:54] <Anticom> any ideas?
[02:26:39] <jop008> if I have tbody how can I loop thru the rows in it?
[02:28:20] <jop008> $('#tblOne > tbody  > tr')
[02:28:33] <Anticom> jop008 $('#yourTbl tbody tr').each(function(key, val) { /*Do whatever you want here, e.g.*/ console.log(this.find('td')); });
[02:28:53] <Anticom> [...] val.find() *
[02:29:09] <Anticom> oh it's even got to be $(val) iirc
[02:29:15] <Anticom> since val is a native dom reference
[02:29:18] <Anticom> and not a jq one
[02:32:00] <Anticom> no one ever worked with full calendar plugin before?! ._.
[02:36:10] <Grundell> Im trying to get a script to work in wordpress and it works in fiddle, but i cant seam to get it to work in WP... says line 230 $ is not a function... anyone know how i can solve this? http://jsfiddle.net/NTGvQ/4/
[02:37:50] <seutje> Grundell: put everything within the closure
[02:37:50] <b-ot> seutje: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[02:38:33] <Grundell> seutje - what do you mean ?
[02:39:32] <seutje> Grundell: you have this: (function($, window, undefined){ ... })(jQuery, this); $somemore.stuff();
[02:39:49] <seutje> move the stuff that comes after })(jQuery, this);
[02:39:52] <seutje> to before it
[02:41:09] <seutje> Grundell: the thing is, WP (like Drupal and some other CMSs), runs jQuery.noConflict(), meaning the $ variable is relinquished to whatever it was before (probably undefined)
[02:41:30] <Grundell> Ahh now it works.
[02:41:32] <Grundell> :)
[02:41:48] <seutje> using the closure (or IIFE or whatever the new fancy term is) (function($, window, undefined){ ... })(jQuery, this);
[02:42:38] <seutje> basically means: run this function, and inside of it, map jQuery to the $ variable (and window to the this variable, which is a way to have things still work within an environment where there is no window, like Node.js)
[02:42:47] <seutje> `g iife
[02:42:47] <b-ot> seutje: Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) → http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[02:43:10] <Grundell> Ahh i see
[02:43:13] <seutje> Grundell:  read that and you'll understand it a whole lot better than by my explanation
[02:43:36] <Grundell> Will do! thanks for giving me an explanation ;D
[02:51:57] <amitprakash> Hi, how do I cause dom manipulation on clicking a class:before element?
[02:52:28] <amitprakash> Basically, I wish to trigger events on pseudo-classes :after and :before via jquery
[02:53:48] <Gregoric> Is there some console bulti into Firebug? Because default FF console produces WARN	GUID query returned undefined; turn on Trace logging for details. when trying to console.log("sth");
[02:53:49] <ravenzz> I am afraid that you can't do that
[02:53:55] <ravenzz> amitprakash ^
[02:54:23] <ravenzz> pseudo elements are no part of the DOM
[02:54:59] <amitprakash> ravenzz, :(
[02:56:43] <amitprakash> ravenzz, however, I can get them via js as window.getComputedStyle($('selector')[0], ':before')
[02:57:36] <jop008> I have a listview with option reveal = true when I add items to it all items are visible which I don't want
[02:57:58] <ravenzz> ?getComputedStyle @ amitprakash
[02:58:03] <ravenzz> oops
[02:58:06] <ravenzz> ?mdn getComputedStyle @ amitprakash
[02:58:07] <b-ot> amitprakash: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org getComputedStyle @ amitprakash”.
[02:58:10] <jop008> I add <li>xx</li>
[02:58:11] <ravenzz> uff
[02:58:14] <ravenzz> ?g mdn getComputedStyle @ amitprakash
[02:58:14] <b-ot> amitprakash: Sorry, no results for ‟mdn getComputedStyle @ amitprakash”.
[02:58:26] <ravenzz> fuck that
[02:58:30] <ravenzz> amitprakash this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.getComputedStyle
[02:58:42] <ravenzz> "getComputedStyle() gives the final used values of all the CSS properties of an element."
[02:58:45] <amitprakash> lol
[02:58:57] <ravenzz> not the element itself
[03:03:10] <jop008> So when adding items to the list it looks like reveal is ignored
[03:03:26] <jop008> can I set reveal afterwards?
[03:11:05] <jop008> How can I add options to the listview?
[03:11:42] <jop008> like this one data-filter="true"
[03:15:42] <ravenzz> jop008 do you need to hook into them with css selectors?
[03:16:10] <steveccc> is there a function for returning a positive number from a source even if its negative ie 45 or -45 will be 45 after the function?
[03:16:16] <jop008> The li items are good inserted in the listview so far so good
[03:16:34] <jop008> but they are visible and settings are reveal
[03:16:43] <jop008> so how to hide them?
[03:17:18] <jop008> when I type and delete characters the list vanished
[03:17:30] <jop008> as I wanted to do so
[03:17:31] <amitprakash> ravenzz, hmm.. so clicking pseudo elements triggers event on dom element they are targets for
[03:17:46] <ravenzz> yes
[03:18:04] <ravenzz> like you click a:before and a will get the click event
[03:18:14] <amitprakash> that sucks
[03:21:23] <amitprakash> ravenzz, at least I can detect if the event clientX/clientY positions are offset wrt parent elements
[03:21:48] <Anticom> is there any callback that is fired, when i exit out of a jq-ui dialog using ESC key?
[03:22:33] <jop008> Can I generated some keys in the listview filter top row?
[03:24:36] <ravenzz> amitprakash maybe you can do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/MWuKB/
[03:26:36] <jop008> var press = jQuery.Event("keypress");press.ctrlKey = false;press.which = 40;searchlist.trigger(press); won't work
[03:27:09] <Gregoric> fell5s, are you still here? :)
[03:33:40] <mezooo> I wrote a simple plugin (similar to jqueryui-slider), now I can do $(selector).SSlider(options); Later in the code I want to programaticly change value, sames as in jqueryui slider: $(selector).val(15). How to attach method to an element?
[03:34:17] <amitprakash> ravenzz, that code is awesome.. trying to figure out how it works :D
[03:35:23] <Gregoric> fella5s, This version seems to work in the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/s5er2/3/ but when I run it  on my server it returns TypeError: this.submit is not a function http://fppp.tk/res/js/validation.js Line 29
[03:35:34] <jop008> Tried this $("#searchlistoptions.ui-input-search").trigger(press); but no key pressed
[03:43:10] <noregret> how can I get the $(this) in a callback? can I use the event param ?
[03:50:05] <titii> Hi, can I detect for element, that he has some event?
[03:50:57] <jop008> how to handle onclick event on a listview?
[03:55:57] <noregret> I have a form without a submit button, and an 'enter' on any text input triggers the request, should I catch the event on that input to stop it or is there another way ?
[03:58:22] <amcsi_work> is it possible to tell chrome or firefox to reload the current HTML? Doing the refresh wastes a lot of time, because the request takes 10 seconds due to remote db access, but I'm only trying to test js changes
[04:01:06] <sonOfRa> what do you mean, reload the current HTML?
[04:01:52] <themojowill> i have the following in an ajax call data: $('#access_type_id, #product_id').serialize() I have since changed so that #product_id is now a javascript variable var product_id whats the way to pass this through in my ajax call?
[04:02:22] <amcsi_work> <sonOfRa> yes
[04:02:33] <linkin> hi
[04:02:45] <amcsi_work> like, refresh the page, but instead of sending a request, just reusing the last HTTP response
[04:03:09] <sonOfRa> save the HTML locally and access it with file:/// comes to mind
[04:03:20] <amcsi_work> but then the relative urls aren't right
[04:03:28] <sonOfRa> generally, it will always reload
[04:04:38] <sonOfRa> unless your server is caching, and sends 304-Not Modified
[04:04:38] <ravenzz> amitprakash the idea behind it is to create the "pseudo-element" in javascript so that you can attach an event handler to it, and fallback to a CSS pseudo-element when js is disabled (or not working)
[04:04:55] <linkin> i want to ask what is the difference between $.fn.<component> $("<selector>").<component>(function()
[04:05:25] <amcsi_work> sonOfRa: I know that's what my webserver is doing. I want a browser-level solution to make it so that a request isn't sent at all
[04:05:57] <sonOfRa> I doubt that is possible. But you can alter the JS code via console
[04:06:24] <themojowill> i have the following in an ajax call data: $('#access_type_id, #product_id').serialize() I have since changed so that #product_id is now a javascript variable var product_id whats the way to pass this through in my ajax call?
[04:06:30] <ravenzz> linkin http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[04:06:32] <sonOfRa> so you can just paste your altered JS code into the javascript elements in the console
[04:06:48] <sonOfRa> that way you won't have to send any requests
[04:09:23] <fella5s> Gregoric, change name of that submit button to something else than "submit" and it will work
[04:09:42] <fella5s> and sorry, i tested that on your server couple of times
[04:09:53] <stack> hi, I have a question , is that possible to detect the error status code in a deferred object after a $.post() ? for example $.post(url).fail(function(){ if(statusCode == 500) dosomething(); })
[04:09:57] <jop008> Any help on this http://pastebin.com/zcdD4KYW?
[04:13:25] <amitprakash> ravenzz, yeah, i can see that .. except I'll have multiple such elements in the page.. and detecting which link was clicked against which pseduo-element will be a pita in this case..
[04:14:05] <amitprakash> also position of the :before pseudo-element is relative to the element.. it'd be hard to replicate this behavior for the dom element created by JS
[04:14:27] <seutje> jop008: there is no #option_detail_rows
[04:15:27] <ravenzz> amitprakash oh yeah in that case you will need to wrap them with a container
[04:16:56] <jop008> There is the options are displayed fine
[04:17:39] <yuka> hi guys
[04:18:03] <yuka> I fixed the yday issue with the slider :) but now I have another issue connected with canvas - >Unable to get value of the property 'getContext'
[04:18:13] <noregret> how can I reload an element? e.g. i want to reload a <img> so it can update its img src that has the same name
[04:18:15] <amitprakash> ravenzz, or detect by offset :)
[04:18:40] <yuka> seems its connected with this two lines: var H = f.parent().find(".canvas-now-canvas")[0];   var B = H.getContext("2d");
[04:19:17] <yuka> I tried wrapping the second in something like if (H.getContext) {  } but doesent help
[04:20:25] <stack> ok I found that the .fail method accept a function that has as first argument a jqXHR, that solves my question, thanks anyway.
[04:20:50] <yuka> value of the property 'getContext': object is null or undefined  -> i understand that there is no object yet when it tries to look for it, but how could i rewrite this piece of code to make it work? please somebody suggest me a solution :)
[04:22:54] <AardvarkGlory> I am having a hard time figuring out why I would use .focusout vs .blur or vise versa.

[04:40:21] <jop008> yes
[04:40:31] <jop008> I tried several things
[04:40:48] <jop008> like this http://pastebin.com/HnErWb8X
[04:41:11] <miCSu> then I guess it's like that, although there's nothing found with #option_detail_rows it the list's added like that
[04:45:34] <miCSu> jop008: so, just check that id's the same in the element and jquery http://jsfiddle.net/x3KTE/
[04:46:27] <jop008> Issue found the ids were not okay
[04:47:17] <jop008> any idea why reveal is not taken into account?
[04:47:34] <jop008> can I hide all elements of a list in a clever way?
[04:49:17] <jop008> I want all items hidden and make them visible if user starts typing in filter area
[04:51:40] <noregret> I have a form without a submit button, and an 'enter' on any text input triggers the request, should I catch the event on that input to stop it or is there another way ?
[04:52:16] <miCSu> jop008: I guess if you're adding the list-items dynamically you have to trigger 'create' for the list after appending the items
[04:53:27] <miCSu> noregret: propably you could catch the event from form submit if you're willing to prevent it
[04:54:59] <jop008> I do a refresh not enough?
[04:55:19] <jop008> Maybe the list is empty at teh beginning

[05:30:57] <fluffypony> so I'm using jQuery's .load function with an interval as a poor man's AJAX reload for a status page with some graphs on it etc.
[05:31:05] <fluffypony> I'm reloading the whole #content section
[05:31:16] <fluffypony> and it works fine, but it's not particularly sleek
[05:31:25] <fluffypony> it is almost like a full page refresh
[05:31:31] <fluffypony> is there anything a little more discreet?
[05:36:09] <Mosselman> hey guys, I am binding on an 'ajax:error' event ( handle(e, response) and for some reason the `response.data` doesn't exist, but instead a `response.responseJSON` is set. Why does the error callback not follow the same API as `ajax:success`?
[05:38:52] <Gregoric> I'd like to set value of input that has name of 'blah' to 'nah', do I do it right? /// $("input[name='blah']").val("nah");
[05:39:16] <shoky> Mosselman: cause they're different events and that's what the docs say..?  where did you read about ajax:error and ajax:success anyway, i keep seeing people reference those
[05:39:37] <Mosselman> shoky: rails
[05:39:50] <shoky> ah
[05:39:54] <Mosselman> shoky: I understand that they are different, but that is no reason to not use the same convention is it?
[05:40:10] <shoky> yes, it is a reason..
[05:40:12] <Mosselman> A bit inconsistent, unless there is a better reason of course.
[05:40:37] <shoky> success doesn't have an errorString argument, for example...
[05:40:51] <Mosselman> shoky: by that reasoning I could change the order of parameters to methods, etc just because they are different things, like with PHP.
[05:41:17] <shoky> Mosselman: if you're following the docs, then sure, you can
[05:42:08] <Mosselman> shoky: that is just nonsense
[05:42:24] <shoky> you started ;p
[05:42:27] <Mosselman> I am not saying that I don't know what the name is. I am saying that the name is wrong.
[05:42:51] <shoky> name of what
[05:43:04] <Mosselman> of the key that holds the response's data
[05:43:18] <Mosselman> it is inconsistent to call it 'responseJSON' in one callback and 'data' in the other
[05:43:25] <Mosselman> While they are callbacks on the same plugin.
[05:43:33] <shoky> i don't know what arguments rails is putting there, anywyas
[05:43:43] <Mosselman> Rails just does an ajax call
[05:43:45] <shoky> in jquery, in the success callback, you get the data as first argument
[05:43:46] <Mosselman> through jQuery
[05:43:56] <shoky> in error, you get the jqXHR as first argument
[05:44:06] <shoky> different entities altogether, nevermind their properties
[05:44:35] <Mosselman> thats not what I meant, hang on
[05:51:12] <Mosselman> shoky: hmm ok, I still don't find it very logical, but I'll accept that I am the one who is wrong
[05:51:13] <Mosselman> :)
[05:51:26] <Mosselman> shoky: thanks for putting me into place :D

[05:58:23] <jop008> Reading this http://jsfiddle.net/fiddleyetu/ffMhk/ and this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/listview-data-filter-reveal-problem-jqm-1-3
[05:58:26] <Fraser> hi
[05:58:52] <jop008> it looks exactly as my problem only the github did not work
[06:01:50] <jop008> is there a way to inject a key stroke in the filter box like sending escape
[06:04:03] <teethree> heya, trying to figure out why my offset().top is firing twice http://pastie.org/8179227
[06:04:40] <Gregoric> I have a question: can I set .val() of a form element that is display:none ? Does not work in my script, nor in fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Gregoric/XmTne/1/
[06:05:03] <Gregoric> of a form input element*
[06:05:59] <shoky> Gregoric: yes..
[06:07:15] <Gregoric> shoky, but when I check in fiddle, it looks like // <input value="" name="entry.13.single"> // so value is not being changed, or I miss something?
[06:08:24] <jop008> Is there a way to scroll to an element ?
[06:08:44] <shoky> Gregoric: the "value" attribute doesn't necessarily show the actual value of the <input>. it's changing just fine:  http://jsfiddle.net/XmTne/2/
[06:10:27] <Fraz> im trying to add and remove stylesheets dynamically using jquery, but the styles dont seem to be getting removed before adding the new one. any idea why? http://pastebin.com/FG13fxaM
[06:10:31] <Gregoric> shoky: okay, thanks. So submitting a form with .hidden elements won't be a problem, the value will remain as it is?
[06:11:55] <shoky> Gregoric: should be fine
[06:12:07] <shoky> Gregoric: but best way is to test..
[06:12:17] <Gregoric> Okay, thanks. Yep, will do :)
[06:13:03] <Gregoric> In the example above firebug was showing the value is ""; that's why I was puzzled
[06:13:20] <teethree> heya, trying to figure out why my offset().top is firing twice http://pastie.org/8179227
[06:13:36] <shoky> Gregoric: .val() would have given you the actual value
[06:14:01] <shoky> Gregoric:  the attribute is not synced with the runtime value
[06:14:49] <Gregoric> Ah, I see.
[06:15:31] <DJTanner> hello all
[06:23:06] <[m]adman> hi all
[06:23:21] <[m]adman> question about cross domain popups
[06:24:04] <[m]adman> i got a window.open bit.. trying to detect if the url for the popup is a local one, meaning on the same server
[06:24:54] <[m]adman> i understand that with the popup's url being from a third party, meaning on another server, same origin policy applies and you are not allowed to inspect the location.href of the popup
[06:25:25] <Fraz> wild idea. open the domain in a hidden iframe and try and access an element. if you cant access one you know if there then its not local?
[06:25:28] <[m]adman> but is there a way to just test if it is of same origin?
[06:25:38] <Fraz> is*
[06:25:48] <jop008> I have this <div id=container> <ul><li/></ul><div> how to handle the onclick on the li item?
[06:26:08] <[m]adman> i'm testing in IE8, and so far I get a permission denied
[06:26:19] <[m]adman> and that error is blocking the rest of the test

[06:31:51] <mnewton> Hey guys say I have a bunch of elements with some text inside them. How do i get the text in an array?
[06:32:26] <mnewton> for example $(".sel").text() should return me an array of text not text all concated together
[06:32:58] <xhoy> .closest goes up, is there a closest down?
[06:33:06] <xhoy> (except find, that returns multiple)
[06:33:43] <xhoy> find returns several results, .children and .siblings returns nothing..?
[06:33:49] <shoky> xhoy: no
[06:34:07] <xhoy> so .find().first() ?
[06:34:17] <shoky> if that's what you want
[06:34:18] <koskoz> hi, can I have a delegate with a selector like this? $('.errorCategories').delegate('a:not(.errorCategory)', 'click', function() {})
[06:34:52] <shoky> koskoz: yep
[06:35:02] <koskoz> because this delegate doesn't seem to work while $('a:not(.errorCategory)', '.errorCategories'); works...
[06:35:04] <xhoy> shoky: yeah i like the first 'child' to match :0
[06:35:55] <jop008> if my onclick fires on the container how can I find out the child element which was clicked on?
[06:35:57] <shoky> `demo @ koskoz

[06:36:52] <jop008> okay
[06:37:14] <shoky> jop008: event being the event argument to the click handler
[06:37:40] <jop008> now that is the container
[06:38:03] <jop008> if I use e.target I got the container
[06:38:08] <jop008> not the child
[06:38:12] <shoky> jsfiddle it
[06:38:35] <jop008> but let me check
[06:39:23] <koskoz> well, it's weird, even if my element is present when the page is loaded it seems that if it moves delegate won't intercept it, I have to rely on a fixed present elemet

[06:41:19] <sm`> gimme sec
[06:41:35] <mjn_> I have a question about a old jQuery module called EasyDrag.
[06:42:02] <mjn_> Specifically, I was wondering about the license it was distributed under.
[06:42:18] <mjn_> EasyDragy, any one?
[06:42:34] <Croves> $('#myInput').val('Croves') does not work, but $('#myInput').attr('value', 'Croves') works fine. Why?
[06:43:39] <mjn_> hello?
[06:44:04] <shoky> Croves: what does "does not work" mean
[06:45:10] <Croves> shoky Well, in the first case the input does not recive my value ('Croves'), but in the seccond case, yes
[06:45:21] <mjn_> Looking for license information on EasyDrag module (old jQuery).
[06:45:35] <shoky> Croves: the actual input doesn't change its contents?
[06:45:49] <Croves> shoky yes, it doesn't change its contents
[06:45:59] <shoky> `demo @ Croves
[06:45:59] <b-ot> Croves: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:47:33] <mjn_> Looking for license information on EasyDrag module (old jQuery).
[06:47:38] <sm`> shoky, http://iwmnetwork.com/s/feed.html and http://iwmnetwork.com/s/feed.js
[06:48:02] <Saaether> mjn_ why not look on the plugins website for that info?
[06:48:06] <SargoDarya> shoky: "does not work": Usual explanation of a problem experienced by an unexperienced individual.
[06:48:19] <mjn_> Because this is an old module and doesn't seem to be available any more.
[06:48:32] <mjn_> It is not on the current plugin site.
[06:49:25] <Saaether> mjn_ quick google search found the website http://fromvega.com/wordpress/2007/07/14/easydrag-jquery-plugin/
[06:49:49] <mjn_> ty, I will check that.
[06:50:58] <jop008> Is there a fcuntoin to scroll an element in to view?
[06:51:37] <shoky> sm`: you added the callback=? which turns it into a JSONP request, but that API isn't responding with JSONP
[06:51:57] <mjn_> No license info on that page.  I gather that fromvega contributed this to the jQuery effort.  Anyone know how to contact him?
[06:53:48] <Saaether> jop008 i use https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[06:54:01] <sm`> shoky, same happens when try without the callback parameter
[06:54:21] <Fraz> so any ideas on adding/removing styleshseets? im adding them with a link="someuniqueid" and removing em with that link, but it doesnt seem to work all the time, and the styles dont seem to get removed visually
[06:54:38] <mjn_> While using another js module is an option, the EasyDrag is already part of a deployed application.  I am trying to make sure that the license stuff is in order.
[06:54:53] <shoky> sm`: that API doesn't support cross-domain requests. (or maybe it has some special way to enable cross-domain, donno)
[06:56:16] <aravindsrivats> HI
[06:56:18] <aravindsrivats> http://jsfiddle.net/rRFn5/
[06:56:25] <Fraz> oh and btw, does (document).ready take iframes into account?
[06:56:45] <aravindsrivats> In there I get the alert(recent) before the getRecentImage function executes even when I set ajax to async:false
[06:57:07] <aravindsrivats> how do I make it so that getRecentImage function executes first?
[07:00:16] <jop008> I se this https://github.com/Arwid/jQuery.scrollIntoView for scrollintoview but no success
[07:01:17] <mjn_> Since it doesn't look like anyone where knows much about this module, I left a comment to fromvega on his WordPress site.  I'm not that hopeful since he hasn't updated it since 2008, however.
[07:01:35] <mjn_> An email address for him would REALLY help.
[07:02:28] <shoky> sm`: use their graph API for it  http://jsfiddle.net/ygs9U/1/
[07:02:53] <Saaether> aravindsrivats are you meaning to send no data to your function? your jquery selectors arent valid
[07:04:15] <aravindsrivats> The ajax returns the result properly. Those selectors are custom tags that I've used.
[07:04:22] <iredmedia> Selectors: JQuerys 80/20 rule.
[07:04:35] <Saaether> ok
[07:05:38] <mjn_> 920 people in this chat room - you'd think someone would know about this.  Sigh.
[07:05:46] <aravindsrivats> how do I make it so that the getRecentImage executes first and then the alert() exectues?
[07:05:55] <sm`> shoky, ia tried that right away... but i still get the same error
[07:05:58] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone. Does anyone here have an Apple running Firefox 22 who could confirm that a page is working correctly? http://www.aprilwine.ca/test-page/  (Click the pop-up window link)
[07:06:02] <Saaether> mjn_ why would you expect people to know some guy that wrote a jquery plugin 6 years ago?
[07:06:05] <shoky> sm`: it's working fine in the fiddle
[07:06:14] <shoky> sm`: don't put callback=?
[07:06:15] <mjn_> because this is the jQuery main support.
[07:06:26] <inv3nt0r> I don't have a mac to test it myself unfortunately
[07:06:26] <mjn_> However, I apologize for my assumptons.
[07:06:27] <Saaether> and that is just a plugin, not part of jquery
[07:07:03] <mjn_> Thanks for the help.  I will continue my search elsewhere.
[07:07:30] <blib1>  I'm looking at someone else's js code that works, but I see code like "var obj = jQuery.parseJSON( jqXHR.responseText )" without a ";" in the end.  - is there an automatic checker that can at least check a js file for validation?
[07:07:55] <shoky> blib1:  that's valid js
[07:08:24] <blib1> shoky: so vars don't require ";"?
[07:08:48] <shoky> blib1: javascript has ASI.. "automatic semicolon insertion"
[07:08:51] <shoky> read about it
[07:09:00] <blib1> What about this-> $().ready(function() {	interval_setting_variable = null; ? no var required?
[07:09:17] <Saaether> no var makes it a global variable
[07:09:30] <Saaether> var just means local
[07:13:05] <sm`> shoky, u're right. I forgot to put back the cache: false parameter. Tnx a bunch!
[07:18:54] <iber> hi there. Is it possible to set jQuery validation callbacks such as submitHandler after the initial rules are set?
[07:20:13] <iber> so imagine one script does var $("form").validator({rules:….}); and then the second script does $("form").validator({ submitHandler: function(){….}})
[07:20:24] <iber> ignore the "var"
[07:20:58] <iber> because from what i understand the second script overrides the first call
[07:24:53] <BillCriswell> iber: Is it a plugin?
[07:25:31] <iber> yeah it's the official jQuery validator http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[07:25:52] <BillCriswell> "official", eh?
[07:25:58] <iber> kind of
[07:28:35] <BillCriswell> iber: Are you sure it overrides it?
[07:28:57] <iber> seems like it :/ unless i'm missing something
[07:29:11] <iber> i'm trying to play around with the setDefaults method
[07:30:08] <iber> i'm basically creating a wrapper which will extend ANY form using this plugin and fire up some extra code
[07:30:11] <shahin8r> What is wrong with this code? The alert("test"); never shows up even tho I scroll past the actual div. Look: http://pastebin.com/2KP5zrhn
[07:32:25] <BillCriswell> shahin8r: Do console.log( $("#projects").offset().top, $(window).scrollTop() ); and make sure it's what you think it is.
[07:34:38] <shahin8r> BillCriswell: shows: 515.1499938964844 935
[07:34:53] <shahin8r> BillCriswell: so it should display?
[07:35:26] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking you don't mean to have it as an else if
[07:35:31] <motaka2> how to group a list of <tr>s in <table> to hide and show them all together?
[07:37:21] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, have an annoying $.ajax() problem with jQuery 1.5.x    I have my 'url' set to '//example.com/store/ajax/updateManager.php', however it gives me status 'cancelled' in my Chrome dev tools and doesn't show up in the XHR tab (only 'All'). When I misspell the file name or path, it gives me a 404 and DOES show up in the XHR tab. Anybody know what's wrong?  Relevant code -- http://bpaste.net/show/H2Bvkvw7yDBQx5oapx1e/
[07:37:23] <BillCriswell> motaka2: You can use class names.
[07:37:37] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Of really anything to select the ones you want to hide.
[07:37:50] <BillCriswell> $('tr').slice(0, 10).hide() would hide the first ten, etc.
[07:39:04] <shahin8r> BillCriswell: haha, of course! :) Thanks
[07:39:18] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[07:39:20] <motaka2> BillCriswell: the answer is using tbody
[07:39:54] <BillCriswell> You didn't say them all...
[07:43:21] <RRR2> Can I create a CSSStyleSheet object?
[07:43:22] <BillCriswell> iber: What are you using submitHandler for? Not too familiar with using it.
[07:43:41] <iber> I'm loading an external URL (tracking pixel)
[07:43:49] <iber> i think it worked
[07:43:50] <iredmedia> RRR2: What do you mean budd?
[07:44:13] <RRR2> a CSSStyleSheet object
[07:44:20] <Anticom> anyone willing to help me with FullCalendar plugin?
[07:44:39] <BillCriswell> iber: I'm not sure how it's supposed to be used. I ended up doing this: http://jsbin.com/edemif/1/edit
[07:45:12] <iredmedia> RRR2: Really...../
[07:45:20] <iredmedia> Thats your elaboration? telling me the exact same thing you said before?
[07:45:23] <RRR2> iredmedia: basically, uhh appending a stylesheet to the document
[07:45:26] <BillCriswell> iber: Actually... that's no good.
[07:45:27] <gianiaz> hi, any weinre expert here? Do you know If I can copy computed html of a page?
[07:45:51] <samuelchan> $('<style/>').html(STYLEZ)
[07:45:52] <iredmedia> got ya, so you want to render CSS in your document, say, in the head?
[07:46:52] <RRR2> Kind of, I want to get the CSSStyleObject (so I can disable it) you know like when document.styleSheets[0].disabled=true
[07:47:43] <BillCriswell> iber: I guess you have to keep it in the same initiation?
[07:47:47] <iredmedia> Thats just a bad implmentation IMO.
[07:48:00] <RRR2> But when I append the link object when calling document.styleSheets I see that the stylesheet hasn't 'loaded' so I can't reach it
[07:48:06] <iredmedia> RRR2: You should be using a single class to theme if you wanna do stuff like that... lots less work.
[07:48:31] <iredmedia> This is what things like scss are amazing for.
[07:48:46] <iber> BillCriswell: yeah seems like it, unless you override the defaults initially before the initiation i.e.http://pastebin.com/DuG2Wc4H
[07:49:25] <RRR2> iredmedia: is for changing styles, so more than one stylesheet is needed isn't it?
[07:49:35] <iredmedia> Either way, yes.
[07:50:12] <iredmedia> So you want the ENTIRE style of the page to change? Or just a section? Either way the solution is the same. Have a 'main' class aka a parent class that ALL your styles for each theme fall under,
[07:50:33] <iredmedia> You can use two separate classes, or my recommendation, a default + an override
[07:50:44] <RRR2> Yeah I'm kinda using that.
[07:50:56] <samuelchan> .enablerClass.actualClassWIthRules
[07:51:23] <samuelchan> well, that's not quite right
[07:51:48] <BillCriswell> iber: Sweet.
[07:52:27] <iredmedia> document.styleSheets[0].disabled = true exist
[07:52:40] <BillCriswell> RRR2: $('<style/>').text('body { color: aqua }').appendTo('head')? haha
[07:52:42] <iredmedia> but, I'm not sure how it affects shit
[07:52:51] <iredmedia> That doesnt work BillCriswell
[07:53:02] <iredmedia> I dono. I tried exactly that and it was failing.
[07:53:43] <RRR2> I just document.create a 'link', append it to head. and try to call document.styleSheets
[07:53:49] <BillCriswell> iredmedia: http://jsbin.com/onozof/1/edit
[07:54:10] <iredmedia> Basssstard... JSfiddle failed me once again.
[07:54:24] <BillCriswell> Either way, if this needs to be done I think something needs a rethoughten.
[07:54:34] <Joe_______> hi
[07:54:38] <BillCriswell> "rethoughten" will be my word from now on.

[08:00:07] <samuelchan> http://fiddle.jshell.net/6bDRN/3/show/light/
[08:00:10] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I'm using '//' but it's not the same thing as 'file:///', I have tried it without the prefixed slashes, and an absolute path without the domain name in there.
[08:00:17] <samuelchan> warning: if you have epilepsy, don't bother clicking
[08:00:55] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Are you testing from a file:/// link though? Like the page you're on?
[08:01:14] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: No, I'm testing it on the actual website hosted by a hosting company.
[08:01:30] <iredmedia> samuelchan: Thank you for that. hahaha
[08:02:23] <BillCriswell> samuelchan: It's like a confetti party.
[08:02:29] <iredmedia> It's a rave, in my head.
[08:02:37] <samuelchan> one of those pixels doesn't move
[08:02:42] <samuelchan> well, 'pixel'
[08:02:48] <iredmedia> LOL liar.
[08:03:01] <samuelchan> look at the code, one is randomly picked to not move ;)
[08:03:36] <samuelchan> before I added the random widths and heights to the boxes, it would've been much easier to find
[08:03:47] <iredmedia> still(
[08:03:57] <samuelchan> relatively speaking, of course :)
[08:04:41] <iredmedia> You're all sorts of crazy
[08:04:51] <iredmedia> FORKED
[08:05:03] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Is there like a redirect or something happening at that url?
[08:05:12] <DeltaHeavy> Nope
[08:05:22] <DeltaHeavy> Figured it out
[08:05:29] <DeltaHeavy> It's from the PHP script exiting with a status of '1'
[08:05:37] <RRR2_> iredmedia: http://jsfiddle.net/68jAK/4/ this the problem
[08:05:43] <RRR2_> I can't get the StyleSheet because appendChild delays, sometimes, it works, sometimes it doesn't
[08:05:52] <samuelchan> I put in a bit that was meant to draw lines showing where those boxes moved from when you clicked
[08:05:53] <iredmedia> I wish i could help you DeltaHeavy but i can't do any investigating.
[08:06:15] <DeltaHeavy> iredmedia: No problem. I already figured it out just now
[08:06:15] <samuelchan> but that changes the fps from 60 to crashes the tab
[08:07:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Sweet.
[08:07:34] <iredmedia> You ARE in the jquery channel, just FYI. :P We all love JS, but some of us get tired of the mundane
[08:07:53] <iredmedia> RRR2: I'm looking into it
[08:07:57] <BillCriswell> chrome://net-internals/ is fun.
[08:10:57] <iredmedia> RRR2: http://jsfiddle.net/iredmedia/68jAK/5/
[08:11:18] <iredmedia> I'm not seeing an error?
[08:11:32] <iredmedia> change the value to "true" instead of false and it works?
[08:11:35] <iredmedia> I'll create a toggler
[08:12:19] <rethus> can i got a jquery-customized version with that jQuery-Savemode anywhere?
[08:13:46] <iredmedia> rethus: Sorry, i didn't understand that
[08:14:16] <rethus> i had jquery in magento. cause there is also prototype, i need this noConfflict-mode.
[08:14:32] <rethus> the old jquery-ui is outdated have a bug with the slider
[08:14:35] <iredmedia> Oh google jquery.noConflict
[08:14:41] <rethus> so i need to replace it by newer one.
[08:14:54] <rethus> if i insert a newone, i got this error "Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined"
[08:14:54] <iredmedia> Oh.
[08:15:35] <rethus> iff i look into the old version, i see (jQuery);; behind each function
[08:15:54] <rethus> excatly this seems be missed.
[08:16:18] <rethus> now i didn't want to open the jquery-ui-file and add on every function this postfix
[08:16:23] <rethus> what can i do
[08:17:21] <iredmedia> I'm not sure you'd need to :\
[08:17:40] <iredmedia> Are you sure you're understanding .conflict?
[08:18:34] <rethus> yes. cause of prototype is useing $. i have to use it in magento
[08:19:34] <iredmedia> Yes, and thats fine
[08:20:28] <iredmedia> You've read the documentation? You're sure you didn't remove anything else? because jquery / jqui is wrapped. Meaning its context is fed into it
[08:20:58] <iredmedia> Might be able help more with specific examples/links
[08:21:13] <iredmedia> I don't have an instance of magento / prototype / jquery floating around :P
[08:21:29] <rethus> thanks, but its still on local machine.
[08:21:41] <rethus> i send the old jquery-file:
[08:21:44] <bahamas> if the server sends either an object or nothing, how do I check 'data' to make sure I cover all cases. 'data' is the arg taken by the 'success' function when using ajax
[08:21:49] <bahamas> ?
[08:22:22] <bahamas> I tried data !== '' but that evaluates to false even when the server doesn't send anything
[08:22:29] <rethus> http://pastebin.de/35603
[08:23:09] <rethus> search for:  (jQuery);;
[08:24:27] <Skizu> Hey, how can I get this to run on load? http://jsfiddle.net/M47p8/5/
[08:24:41] <Skizu> As well as when it currently is
[08:31:51] <ajmrsn> is it background-image or background-url and what should the format of the value be for .css( { } );?
[08:32:36] <ajmrsn> is base64 data allowed to be used in place of the url?
[08:32:42] <neataroni> absolutely maddening bug here- occasionaly, when i move elements of a table made sortable with jquery .sortable(), the td widths all of a sudden become equal between all td's. I tried adding a stop event handler to .css({'width':'7% !important'}), but the size of the td doesn't change. I tried modifying the css in the inspector, and it still doesn't change visually. What the hell?
[08:33:17] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: You'd want to use .css({backgroundImage: 'url(..)'}) or .css({'background-image': 'url(..)'})
[08:33:28] <BillCriswell> base64 should be cool. Don't see why not. Try it and see.
[08:33:44] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: ok, thanks
[08:34:01] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Most people just forget the url() part.
[08:34:13] <Afuna>  /11
[08:34:29] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: excellent :) many thanks
[08:34:35] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Welcoem
[08:35:34] <BillCriswell> neataroni: Are you trying to make it smaller or larger? The other elements in the column can keep it from becoming smaller.
[08:35:45] <sheeny> How do i loop through all table rows with a certain id?
[08:36:38] <BillCriswell> sheeny: If you have duplicate ids you're doing something wrong.
[08:36:40] <rethus> can i adjust the sensibility off the slider?
[08:37:21] <neataroni> BillCriswell: There are 3 td's, im trying to make the outside ones smaller
[08:38:08] <neataroni> sheeny: use class instead of id if you want multiple things
[08:38:27] <sheeny> BillCriswell: I have a table where a row is a header, then it has "children" but they are just rows, these have a class of "child" which i hide on load. then when i click a header i get the header id and i need to show all the children with that id
[08:38:46] <sheeny> I have used the class for "child" so i can hide them all
[08:38:51] <sheeny> can i have more than 1?
[08:38:58] <sheeny> would that work?
[08:39:13] <BillCriswell> Yes. You should use a class for sure.
[08:39:31] <BillCriswell> You can use the same class as many times as you want, an id must only be used once
[08:39:52] <BillCriswell> neataroni: Not sure what you mean by outside ones?
[08:40:02] <sheeny> but im using it for "child" then i have id as the group id, if i used class for the showing, how would i then hide all of them
[08:40:37] <neataroni> BillCriswell: its normally sized like this [        td           ][      td     ][ td ]
[08:40:42] <BillCriswell> sheeny: Have your code anywhere for us to see? If not you should post it at like jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[08:40:57] <neataroni> but then once and a while it pops to: [     td      ][     td    ][    td    ]
[08:41:19] <neataroni> 35%, 58%, 7%
[08:41:36] <neataroni> then sometimes it changes (at least visually) to 33%,33%,33%
[08:42:16] <sheeny> BillCriswell: right ive got it working but then it doesnt fully work ill jsfiddle it
[08:43:26] <BillCriswell> neataroni: I'd probably need to see it in action to see what's going on.
[08:45:16] <neataroni> BillCriswell: http://22aa5889.ngrok.com/app2/  … go to processes pane and then click create new process. Add steps, reorder and delete them, and eventually it should happen
[08:45:42] <sheeny> BillCriswell: damn it works in my jsfiddle haha hmm
[08:46:34] <neataroni> seems to happen most frequently when you delete everything from steptypes and then add more steps
[08:47:25] <sheeny> BillCriswell: is there any reason this wouldnt work on my copy?
[08:47:27] <sheeny> http://jsfiddle.net/x55hE/
[08:47:35] <sheeny> my jsfiddle works fine
[08:48:16] <sheeny> but it doesnt work on my actual dev :(
[08:48:47] <BillCriswell> sheeny: Can't know the issue without looking t the code.
[08:49:02] <sheeny> BillCriswell: http://localhost:3000/companies/1/company_branches/4/clients/7/projects/2/proposals/new
[08:49:17] <sheeny> BillCriswell:opps... http://jsfiddle.net/x55hE/
[08:49:18] <sheeny> haha
[08:49:45] <BillCriswell> sheeny: But this is working.
[08:50:09] <blib1>  minify input.css output.css -> output.css > input.css in size?
[08:50:35] <BillCriswell> neataroni: table-layout: fixed; seems to be the culprit?
[08:50:54] <BillCriswell> Never even heard of that one.
[08:51:30] <neataroni> BillCriswell: crazy
[08:51:54] <sheeny> BillCriswell: Ah my bad, I was duplicating the jquery code as it was in a loop on something
[08:52:01] <BillCriswell> sortables on a <tbody>... You are brave sir.
[08:52:17] <BillCriswell> I don't trust <tables>.
[08:53:32] <neataroni> BillCriswell: i really hate them
[08:54:00] <neataroni> BillCriswell: I should just use bootstrap rows
[08:54:21] <BillCriswell> neataroni: Even though it's very obviously tabular data, I'd avoid the table lol
[08:54:49] <neataroni> BillCriswell: I agree- thanks for finding the culprit btw
[08:54:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:58:47] <neataroni> BillCriswell: well, for what its worth, since i need table-layout: fixed for the elipsis stuff, another fix is to add a colgroup with widths specified. This is something I had never heard of until 2 minutes ago
[08:59:20] <BillCriswell> neataroni: They're pretty sweet.
[08:59:36] <BillCriswell> I hear about new things every day with HTML, thought I knew all of it.
[09:00:06] <BillCriswell> Like.. <textarea wrap="hard"></textarea> and indeterminate checkboxes
[09:00:28] <neataroni> blowing my mind :)… I'm a backend dev by trade, so its a jungle out there for me
[09:02:30] <BillCriswell> neataroni: I've been more back-end recently.
[09:03:31] <BillCriswell> I don't get the same satisfaction though.. No one notices a good job, but when something messes up everyone notices
[09:04:09] <BillCriswell> It's like a good usability guy.
[09:09:03] <dawg1> howdy!
[09:09:34] <dawg1> i am looking for help with what seems like a small issue.
[09:10:04] <dawg1> i am customizing splunk application and i have some jquery that changes teh class of a TR when a certain TR class is click
[09:10:11] <dawg1> basically toggels 'off' and 'on'
[09:10:20] <dawg1> but the issue is the very first click never works.
[09:10:33] <dawg1> i have to click on the screen once before it will work
[09:11:09] <dawg1> http://pastebin.com/MjDfdrXu
[09:15:01] <sainaen> dawg1, why do you have "$(document).click(function(){" at the top? it's waiting for click on document (page) to setup listeners on your rows.
[09:15:30] <sainaen> I guess it should be "$(function () {" instead.
[09:16:16] <RA3OR> anyone proficient in datatables? i want to be able to implement select ... limit x,y; with datatables

[09:19:30] <sainaen> dawg1, so you didn't see my answer?
[09:19:56] <dawg1> no i didn't. i tried PMing someone in pidgin and 'generating key' window froze up my screen
[09:20:00] <sainaen> > dawg1, why do you have "$(document).click(function(){" at the top? it's waiting for click on document (page) to setup listeners on your rows.
[09:20:06] <sainaen> > I guess it should be "$(function () {" instead.

[09:45:52] <blib> Can anyone please tell me how to animate this two liner nicely? -- http://bpaste.net/show/WwcMtQ2TBFmiqiZGBRGr/
[09:48:56] <happyface> what's a good way to modularize a big jQuery project? I found TerrificJS but it might not be necessary. Any suggestions on concepts?
[09:56:35] <porton> I want a fold control (not fold effect). Which extension to use?
[09:58:22] <neataroni> how to I apply a $('selector') on something that i already selected via $('selector')?
[09:58:39] <BillCris_> bealtine: You can use .find() if you're looking at the children.
[09:58:50] <BillCris_> or .filter() if you need to check the roots.
[09:58:55] <neataroni> BillCris_: awesome, thank you
[10:13:01] <Gmac_> i want to create a copy of a submit button and place it somewhere out of the form is this possible?
[10:13:11] <Gmac_> or just make an anchor that when clicked submits the form
[10:15:52] <AwesomePossum> How do I use Jquery.live() with user defined events?  When I use bind/on() I can provide multiple user diefined events but, live does not seem to accept that.
[10:17:42] <BillCriswell> AwesomePossum: Why do you need live when you can use bind?
[10:17:50] <BillCriswell> ... when you can use .on *
[10:18:10] <blib> Can anyone please tell me how to animate this two liner nicely? -- http://bpaste.net/show/WwcMtQ2TBFmiqiZGBRGr/
[10:18:38] <AwesomePossum> Well, I am creating elements I need to bind events to and i was hoping there was a way to do so without having bind them at creation.
[10:18:59] <AwesomePossum> During Run-tim**
[10:19:08] <AwesomePossum> *run-time
[10:20:18] <BillCriswell> AwesomePossum: Do $('.parent').on('click', '.created-element', function(){ ... });
[10:20:58] <AwesomePossum> BillCriswell: Thanks.

[10:23:30] <Tomashe1> hey guys. i got some error in my website i have no idea what cousing it
[10:23:35] <Tomashe1> any pro here :)
[10:25:07] <darcyclarke>  beh
[10:25:20] <darcyclarke> Tomashe1 sup gee
[10:25:24] <Tomashe1> i get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) "
[10:25:27] <Tomashe1> with no explanation
[10:25:34] <darcyclarke> …. that's an explanation
[10:25:39] <darcyclarke> you've obviously got a syntax error
[10:25:48] <bealtine> theres your answer
[10:26:01] <darcyclarke> shoot us the url
[10:26:05] <darcyclarke> we'll help you find it
[10:26:13] <BillCriswell> You definitely needed a pro for that one.
[10:26:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How come the height() function doesn't work in chrome on a floating element?
[10:26:23] <darcyclarke> hahaha BillCriswell don't be mean
[10:26:29] <Tomashe1> www.lasso.co.il
[10:26:44] <Tomashe1> when clicking on the items below the big image
[10:26:45] <darcyclarke> ecky--ptang-zoob most likely height auto? should still work
[10:26:48] <Tomashe1> that accour
[10:26:51] <darcyclarke> it gets computed styles
[10:26:52] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I can't imagine that being true.
[10:27:41] <shoky> Tomashe1: you're trying to $.parseJSON an html string
[10:27:55] <Tomashe1> so.. it worked until lnow
[10:28:04] <shoky> oh sorry it's not html
[10:28:30] <Tomashe1> i fixed it before parse the json
[10:28:31] <Tomashe1> :)
[10:29:43] <BillCriswell> Tomashe1: Resave the file without BOM.
[10:29:52] <Tomashe1> hmm
[10:30:13] <Tomashe1> no bom
[10:33:02] <darcyclarke> $$$$$$$$ money
[10:33:24] <Tomashe1> big mistery issue
[10:33:28] <darcyclarke> ?
[10:33:32] <darcyclarke> you still having issues?
[10:33:38] <darcyclarke> I didn't get an error
[10:33:49] <darcyclarke> what items am I supposed to click on Tomashe1 ??
[10:34:03] <Tomashe1> i remove the data from the retuend jason
[10:34:06] <Tomashe1> json*
[10:34:11] <Tomashe1> i put it back
[10:34:13] <Tomashe1> and error back
[10:34:20] <Tomashe1> so its something with the data parser
[10:34:25] <darcyclarke> provide steps to reproduce
[10:34:32] <Tomashe1> something in my data is escaped or something
[10:34:44] <Tomashe1> what should i escape when talking on json?
[10:35:35] <darcyclarke> Tomashe1 ah, so you have an error with your json data? you should sanitize that
[10:36:13] <darcyclarke> a quick google search gave me this little snippet: https://gist.github.com/jamischarles/1046671
[10:36:15] <darcyclarke> check it out
[10:36:22] <Tomashe1> hmm
[10:36:32] <darcyclarke> try running your data/json string through that before running it
[10:36:50] <Tomashe1> maybe i should fix it in the php scope
[10:37:03] <darcyclarke> probably
[10:37:12] <Tomashe1> ok thanks guys
[10:37:15] <Tomashe1> i wil ltry somehting
[10:37:26] <Tomashe1> i was came here since i was sure its some weird js issue
[10:37:26] <darcyclarke> that's always better then trying nothing ;)
[10:37:48] <darcyclarke> goog luck
[10:37:54] <darcyclarke> good* luck either way
[10:38:43] <Tomashe1> thanks guys
[10:39:49] <darcyclarke> anytime
[10:39:54] <blib> how do I trigger an animation (perhaps using css) - when this is run ? $('#everything').removeClass('span9').addClass('span12');
[10:41:40] <CiE|Work> i have a variable defined outside my functions but when i update it from within my function it doesn't update the variable outside the function any help?
[10:43:18] <gnarf> CiE|Work: jsfiddle?
[10:43:25] <CiE|Work> i pasted a bin
[10:43:26] <gnarf> `demo
[10:43:26] <b-ot> gnarf: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:43:54] <darcyclarke> blib: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/N6Y23/2/
[10:43:54] <CiE|Work> gnarf http://pastebin.com/8sJAePis
[10:44:04] <gnarf> CiE|Work: `this.value`?
[10:44:09] <gnarf> in a doc ready?
[10:44:17] <gnarf> doubt that gives you what you're looking for
[10:44:23] <CiE|Work> i am readying from google and trying what i can lol
[10:44:41] <darcyclarke> blib: without the awkward delay :P http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/N6Y23/3/
[10:44:51] <gnarf> also, line 30 and and 36 in that pastebin are evaluated at the time doc ready happens, not every time
[10:45:35] <CiE|Work> gnarf is there a way to have them evaluated everyime my html select changes?
[10:45:50] <CiE|Work> the calLocation is the id of the html select
[10:46:10] <darcyclarke> p.s. blib you should change your name to "bilbo" because thats what I want to type everytime I message you
[10:46:55] <gnarf> CiE|Work: hard to tell - does the plugin have a method to change the url's after setup?
[10:47:03] <darcyclarke> CiE|Work: you looking for an event fired when select changes? http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:47:08] <gnarf> CiE|Work:  you will probably bind to the "change" event on the select box
[10:47:20] <gnarf> and then use the api to update the links
[10:47:33] <CiE|Work> gnarf is that what i did on line 3?
[10:47:37] <CiE|Work> bind to the change event?
[10:48:20] <Tomashe1> i put my json into validator and i got that : {    "data": "<div class=\"row-fl....   -------------^Expecting 'STRING', 'NUMBER', 'NULL', 'TRUE', 'FALSE', '{', '['
[10:48:23] <Tomashe1> what is that means?
[10:48:25] <CiE|Work> the plugin does have a remove event sources and then an add event sources, but i have't been able to get them to work
[10:48:28] <gnarf> yeah - but like not sure what "refecthEvents" does, or where it gets it data from
[10:48:38] <Tomashe1> it says the error is here " "<div"
[10:48:41] <Tomashe1> how so..
[10:48:49] <gnarf> Tomashe1: what are you using to produce the json?
[10:48:54] <CiE|Work> the refresh events just refreshes from the URL's in the eventSources on line 21
[10:49:06] <Tomashe1> what u mean by that... ?
[10:49:10] <gnarf> CiE|Work: except those urls are just strings - not methods...
[10:49:19] <marcules> Good afternoon :)
[10:49:19] <gnarf> Tomashe1: like - how are you outputing this json?
[10:49:29] <Tomashe1> i save my html into an object
[10:49:35] <CiE|Work> gnarf if i put them in a variable array would i then be able to update the array?
[10:49:45] <gnarf> CiE|Work: /me shrugs
[10:49:49] <CiE|Work> or will it still only be evaluated the same time?
[10:50:00] <darcyclarke> gnarf how do I jQuery?
[10:50:03] <darcyclarke> :P
[10:50:09] <gnarf> CiE|Work: gotta think like a javascript interpreter...
[10:50:31] <Tomashe1> i save it into varible into php and scape it
[10:50:38] <gnarf> Tomashe1: pastebin?
[10:50:43] <Tomashe1> php?
[10:50:45] <Tomashe1> or the json?
[10:50:48] <gnarf> Tomashe1: are you using json_encode ?
[10:50:59] <Tomashe1> nop im not
[10:51:00] <gnarf> http://php.net/json_encode
[10:51:03] <gnarf> you should be
[10:51:09] <gnarf> then there won't be problems
[10:52:02] <blib> darcyclarke: Here is the current code: http://bpaste.net/show/WwcMtQ2TBFmiqiZGBRGr/ - would be nice to use your fiddle to create that effect. Note that I have to trigger this from JS
[10:52:21] <blib> oh! you did that for me already - reading your code
[10:52:43] <Tomashe1> the json_encode create malformed json i dont wanna use it
[10:53:07] <gnarf> Tomashe1: um - not using json_encode creates malformed json
[10:53:14] <gnarf> json_encode creates json
[10:53:28] <Tomashe1> i just want json string..
[10:53:44] <gnarf> json_encode($object) gives you a json string
[10:53:45] <Tomashe1> i mean a line comftable with json
[10:53:52] <Tomashe1> yes but i dotn wanna do it like that :/
[10:53:59] <gnarf> Tomashe1: then i won't help you do it wrong
[10:54:06] <gnarf> i will help you do it right...
[10:54:09] <gnarf> but not wrong
[10:54:09] <gnarf> sorry
[10:54:36] <darcyclarke> blib adding/removing a class with JS will trigger the css animation
[10:55:53] <darcyclarke> blib if you're adding a class to the element, why do ".css('display','block')" ? seems like bad form, you could just add the css property to the class you're adding (ie. "span3")
[10:56:02] <darcyclarke> in CSS
[10:56:58] <gnarf> also - wtf lame class names? :) blib - surely "span3" could be something more semantic
[10:57:24] <darcyclarke> like "makeAwesomeClass" :P
[10:57:58] <darcyclarke> gnarf he/she is probably using a framework/library with a grid system
[10:58:00] <sainaen> Tomashe1, try to escape quotes with two backslashes on the server: http://jsfiddle.net/Wzfck/1/ (one extra back slash because it's in JS)
[10:58:13] <gnarf> oh - darn grids...
[10:58:50] <Tomashe1> hmm
[10:58:51] <sainaen> Tomashe1, update: http://jsfiddle.net/Wzfck/2/
[10:58:58] <darcyclarke> blib just make sure you have the "transition" property set on the element you're adding/removing classes so that you get that nice CSS animation jazziness when you switch between them
[11:00:21] <gnarf> Tomashe1: if you just use json_encode - it will give you the right json... also - why would you ever define a string with json inside js sainaen?
[11:01:44] <gnarf> `js JSON.stringify({ "data": "<span class=\"test\">test</span>" })
[11:01:52] <Tomashe1> sainaen not working
[11:01:54] <Tomashe1> hmm
[11:02:04] <Tomashe1> json_encode still not working
[11:02:10] <Tomashe1> JSON.stringify( < i will try that
[11:02:12] <gnarf> Tomashe1: pastebin
[11:02:21] <gnarf> Tomashe1: pastebin the php where json_encode isn't working
[11:02:33] <gnarf> also see `doesn't work
[11:02:37] <gnarf> `doesn't work
[11:02:41] * gnarf frowns
[11:02:43] <gnarf> bots....
[11:02:46] <Tomashe1> wait
[11:02:46] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[11:03:00] <Tomashe1> wait
[11:03:08] <gnarf> basically - "isn't working" is a bad choice of words - describe the problem :)
[11:03:11] <Tomashe1> maybe the solution is to echeck whats the issue with the string
[11:03:16] <Tomashe1> where the problem is
[11:03:28] <BillCriswell> gnarf: They're never there when you need them.
[11:04:46] <gnarf> `js console.log('test')
[11:04:54] <gnarf> `eval console.log('test')
[11:05:06] <BillCriswell> It'll just keep letting you down.
[11:05:18] <gnarf> b-ot: i thought you were cooler than this?
[11:05:18] <b-ot> gnarf: it is certain.
[11:05:25] <gnarf> b-ot: then where is my eval?
[11:05:25] <b-ot> gnarf: very doubtful.
[11:05:34] * gnarf slaps b-ot
[11:05:38] <BillCriswell> It sounds like he's refusing.
[11:05:45] <BillCriswell> It's begun.
[11:06:24] <dcherman> The bot does follow the 3 laws......right?
[11:06:55] <sainaen> gnarf, just to show a simple example of string with JSON in it.
[11:07:25] <BillCriswell> I thought Asimov's laws were pretty solid.
[11:08:18] <Tomashe1> i think i found it
[11:08:21] <gnarf> sainaen: except a string with JSON has more encoding than JSON - hence why you'd probably never actually define a string like that
[11:08:25] <Tomashe1> i have an \ in the text
[11:08:34] <Gmac_> how can i texst if text in an element has changed?
[11:08:42] <gnarf> Tomashe1: and json_encode would properly escape it for you ;)
[11:08:48] <Gmac_> change() only works for vlues
[11:09:00] <Gmac_> values of an input
[11:09:22] <gnarf> JSON is a language designed to be generated and interpreted by computers... let computers write and read it... don't go trying to write your own encoders, just use the ones built for your language
[11:09:26] <Tomashe1> all fixed!
[11:09:28] <Tomashe1> thanks guys!
[11:10:40] <darcyclarke> gnarf you haven't answered… how do I jQuery?!?!? itz im0rtant
[11:10:47] <darcyclarke> imp0rtant
[11:11:07] <darcyclarke> Tomashe1: you rock!
[11:11:23] <gnarf> darcyclarke: it's just a jump to the left...
[11:11:30] <darcyclarke> pinteresting
[11:11:37] <darcyclarke> I thought it was right to begin with
[11:11:43] <darcyclarke> but I know nothing
[11:11:45] <darcyclarke> :D
[11:11:48] <gnarf> jump to the left, step to the right
[11:11:48] <BillCriswell> I'm ready to do the time warp.
[11:12:18] <darcyclarke> $("#darcy").do().timeWarp();
[11:12:53] <darcyclarke> $ is dead… long live jQuery!!!!
[11:13:09] <BillCriswell> TIm Curry is awesome.
[11:14:15] <BillCriswell> http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/26600000/Pennywise-GIFs-pennywise-26624014-500-274.gif
[11:14:18] <sainaen> gnarf, oh. ok. thanks.
[11:17:14] <imdea> Hi, I'm trying to validate something an input with jquery that consist in a name that could compound, for instance: "John" or "John Michael".. I'm using this regexp: ^[a-zA-Z]+\s?[a-zA-Z]*$ but when I type for instance "John" and after that a space then it seems it doesn't match. any ideas?
[11:17:31] <KnowWhat> how can i fire an event upon loading a new data in a div
[11:17:53] <KnowWhat> i dont have control over updating div code
[11:18:16] <gnarf> imdea: /^[a-zA-Z]+\s?[a-zA-Z]*$/ ?
[11:18:25] <gnarf> imdea: or new RegExp("^[a-zA-Z]+\s?[a-zA-Z]*$") ?
[11:18:33] <gnarf> because if it's the later, you need an extra \
[11:18:42] <gnarf> new RegExp("^[a-zA-Z]+\\s?[a-zA-Z]*$") ?
[11:19:03] <imdea> gnarf, actually I'm trying to use it inside jquery validator
[11:19:06] <imdea> plugin
[11:19:16] <gnarf> imdea: /me shrugs - are you passing a regexp object, or a string?
[11:19:24] <imdea> gnarf, using new RexExp
[11:19:27] <gnarf> if you are passing a string, you need \\ because "\s" === "s"
[11:19:41] <gnarf> try on your own console: "\s" === "s"
[11:20:49] <imdea> gnarf: what console?
[11:21:13] <gnarf> imdea: the javascript console in your browser?
[11:21:24] <gnarf> just try "\\s" instead of "\s" - trust
[11:21:35] <dwarder> i click on #div1, inside that div is another div without id, how do i click on this id?
[11:21:40] <dwarder> this div*
[11:21:48] <dwarder> how do i click on this div
[11:21:50] <dwarder> ?
[11:21:52] <imdea> gnarf, "true"
[11:22:08] <dwarder> programmatically click
[11:22:08] <gnarf> imdea: so - what i'm meaning there is that "\s" is the same thing as just saying "s"
[11:22:37] <imdea> gnarf: but isn't supposed that \d (for digits) and \s for spaces?
[11:22:37] <gnarf> if you use the regexp /\s/ works
[11:22:42] <imdea> ohh
[11:22:43] <imdea> i see
[11:22:47] <imdea> ok.. sorry
[11:22:54] <gnarf> but new RegExp("\\s")
[11:23:04] <kaldrenon> When I call a function that's overloaded in jQuery UI, how can I determine whenther the UI or the core version is being called? (specific situation: removeClass)
[11:23:05] <gnarf> because inside the string, \ needs to be escaped by a \
[11:23:30] <CiE|Work> gnarf i made it a function and it's still not working can you take a look at my paste?
[11:23:40] <gnarf> kaldrenon: it always calls the ui version first, and that passes it along to the core version
[11:24:00] <CiE|Work> gnarf http://paste.laravel.com/Foz
[11:24:02] <imdea> gnarf, thank you very much
[11:24:13] <kaldrenon> gnarf: In that case, how would you recommend testing whether UI is loaded?
[11:24:19] <gnarf> CiE|Work: sorry, i gotta run really soon - plus pastes aren't doing much because there is a bunch of code not shown - I have never used that
[11:24:25] <gnarf> kaldrenon: why do you want to?
[11:24:34] <CiE|Work> ok thanks
[11:25:04] <kaldrenon> gnarf: I'm calling removeClass with a duration and it's not animating, so I'm wondering if the UI features aren't being used.
[11:25:10] <gnarf> kaldrenon: and UI is a collection of a bunch of plugins, are you specifically looking to see if UI effects core is loaded (the thing that provides removeClass?)
[11:25:34] <gnarf> kaldrenon: what version of UI are you expecting?
[11:25:51] <blib> darcyclarke: are you around?
[11:26:12] <kaldrenon> gnarf: tbh not actually sure, I'm loading jQuery and jQuery UI through gems in a rails app
[11:26:38] <gnarf> kaldrenon: newish versions (1.9+) should respond to if ($.effects.animateClass)
[11:26:57] <dwarder> is there something like $(this div).click(); ?
[11:27:25] <gnarf> actually seems 1.8 should test on that too
[11:27:41] <dwarder> i.e. div inside the element on which event has occured?
[11:27:46] <gnarf> kaldrenon: $.effects.animateClass is the function that actually does the class animations
[11:28:00] <gnarf> so if it doesn't exist, removeClass isn't enhanced
[11:28:00] <kaldrenon> gnarf: Thanks, I'll test for that and double-check my gems
[11:28:20] <dwarder> anyone?
[11:28:42] <gnarf> dwarder: $(this).find('div').click() ?
[11:28:48] <dwarder> or do i need $(this >div)
[11:29:43] <gnarf> dwarder: though thats probably going to generate an infinite loop of clicks
[11:29:45] <gnarf> just fyi
[11:29:51] <gnarf> events "bubble" up
[11:30:04] <gnarf> so you'll need to make sure to stopPropagation on the event inside the inner handler
[11:30:21] <gnarf> but really, it's probably "smartest" to just bind the same handler to the outer click anyway
[11:30:26] <gnarf> because they bubble
[11:30:42] <gnarf> and you will catch the click on the outer div no matter what, you can just find the inner div inside the handler
[11:33:17] <kaldrenon> gnarf: jQuery UI wasn't loaded! D'oh. Fixed it up, removeClass animates as expected.
[11:33:24] <dwarder> gnarf: i see, thanks
[11:36:46] <dbcclarke>  Hey all..I have a question about inserting a simple JQplot on my webpage. How would I go about doing so? What are the minimum files I need?
[11:36:57] <dbcclarke> I know I need a jquery.jqplot.css file...what other files would I need
[11:37:26] <dbcclarke> I went to this url http://www.jqplot.com/docs/files/usage-txt.html but I dont quite understand
[11:37:56] <sunbeam> how come with the latest download of Bootstrap no image files?
[11:47:12] <wagtag> If I resolve the Deferred object with some args is there a way to call deferred.resolve() again later with new args? It seems that once Deferred is resolved .done and .then always return the original args
[11:51:49] <dawg1> err
[11:51:57] <feens> I'm working with a sortable/draggable…and I notice that in the callbacks, the ui object differs between 'start' and 'receive' (i.e. if I set something on ui.item in start it is not present in ui.item in receive)…is this intended?
[11:55:59] <lastent> Hi, I have to upload a file in an form that I submit with ajax, is there any way to do this?
[11:57:49] <BillCriswell> lastent: You can't choose the file without the user doing it.
[11:59:16] <NoiseEee> lastent: also, xhr / traditional ajax can't send files that way, but xhr2 sure can
[12:25:53] <lastent> NoiseEee, but xhr2 is not supported by all the browsers right?
[12:26:27] <noregret> http://bpaste.net/show/QiGg9C2niHZpEl89Cr2K/ why isn't the tablesorter() executed here? if I use that in the console after the page loads, it works fine.. but why not in the page ?
[12:26:41] <NoiseEee> lastent: no but you should fine some ready-to-go libs with fallbacks on github im sure
[12:29:39] <ph0n3tic> Hey guys, Im very confused on how to target selectors that are dynamically created, after page load.
[12:30:15] <ph0n3tic> I always get an empty JQuery object.
[12:31:11] <iredmedia> Code example? You shouldn't have any issue. If you ask JQ to create multiple new objects, the selector engine will work fine
[12:33:06] <noregret> i'm having a problem here http://bpaste.net/show/vGqKaZms1jJ6mGF8wmJ3/, load_sort() is being executed *before* loads() completes.. wth.. any ideas ?
[12:33:38] <noregret> load_sort() should be a callback after completion.. right?
[12:40:18] <ph0n3tic> iredmedia: it's hard for me to provide a code example, but basically, I have some jquery code that runs on page load, binding an event handler to an element that always exists. Within this handler, however, I am trying to select an element that is dynamically created and destroyed.
[12:45:54] <BillCriswell> ph0n3tic: You'd just select it? Unless I'm not following.
[12:48:22] <ph0n3tic> BillCriswell: You were right, I was actually misunderstanding my problem. The item i want to select has a special class. I try to target it by that class when the enter key is pressed, however, when the enter key is pressed this class gets removed, so I think thats why I am  getting an empty object.
[12:50:16] <BillCriswell> Can you select it on keydown instead of press? Never played around with that too much but I imagine it should still be available at key down
[13:00:30] <bray9082> would jquery be a good thing to use if i want vertical scrolling
[13:00:58] <BillCriswell> bray9082: You don't need jQuery for that. Just CSS.
[13:01:49] <bray9082> i wanted a fixed with scrolling
[13:02:00] <bray9082> so like only things in the middle of my page would scroll
[13:02:19] <bray9082> Would CSS still be what i would use
[13:03:17] <BillCriswell> bray9082: Not having much luck following you
[13:03:48] <bray9082> i have 3 boxes on my website on on the left one in the center and one on the right
[13:03:56] <bray9082> i want only the one in the center to be scroll
[13:05:00] <bray9082> If you want an example i can link you to one
[13:05:58] <bray9082> BillCriswell: do you need a link
[13:06:03] <bray9082> ping me i will be right back
[13:07:09] <BillCriswell> bray9082: http://jsbin.com/ukozas/1/edit like this?
[13:08:51] <bray9082> Yes
[13:09:00] <bray9082> would i use CSS or Jquery for that
[13:09:08] <bray9082> Looks like CSS
[13:09:22] <bray9082> could i use HTML for that as well
[13:09:36] <BillCriswell> bray9082: You are using HTML as well.
[13:09:53] <bray9082> but could i use 100% HTML and cut out CSS
[13:10:11] <BillCriswell> bray9082: Ideally you wouldn't.
[13:11:08] <bray9082> well i have a webpage and never created a CSS file for it
[13:11:23] <bray9082> would i need to?
[13:11:55] <BillCriswell> bray9082: http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/
[13:12:36] <bray9082> I was asking for the scrollbar
[13:18:22] <erikcw> I'm running into an issue where query ajax requests are failing in Chrome before they even hit the server.  The chrome dev tools say the status is "(failed)" and the Type is "Pending".  Any thoughts on what the issue could be?
[13:22:01] <asmod4n> Hello, is there a way to automatically get the latest 1.* version via bower or github?
[13:25:13] <Gmac_> how can i get an anchor to trigger a click on a form submit button
[13:25:20] <Space_> can you change data attribute titles? I need to change data-600 to data-200
[13:25:36] <Space_> I have a start at a function but it doesn't work https://gist.github.com/lindleywhite/9bd5d609d84a437f3bc0
[13:27:25] <noregret> i'm having a problem here http://bpaste.net/show/vGqKaZms1jJ6mGF8wmJ3/, load_sort() is being executed *before* loads() completes.. wth.. any ideas ?
[13:28:05] <iredmedia> Space_: I'm seeing an implementation issue, rather than a coding issue.
[13:28:43] <iredmedia> You have to think of data-attrs as key-value pairs. so your key maybe should be data-width=600?
[13:29:07] <iredmedia> Again, I cant really tell whats going on at a glance due to your naming
[13:29:44] <Gmac_> how can i get an anchor to trigger a click on a form submit button
[13:29:45] <Gmac_> anyone?
[13:29:46] <Gmac_> i tried using submit()
[13:29:46] <Gmac_> but that loses all the form validaiotn and stuff that would happen if you actually press submit
[13:30:25] <Space_> I am using a library that detects those keys and I need to change them based on viewport width
[13:32:39] <gcpeters> @Gmac_ have you tried $('#submit-button-ID').trigger('click')
[13:32:59] <Gmac_> yeah but the submit button it self has form validaiotn stuff when you click it
[13:33:05] <Gmac_> and if u do that it skips all that
[13:33:33] <Gmac_> i basically am using gravity forms in wordpress and it has a submit button
[13:33:44] <Gmac_> i want to have a button at the bottom somewhere else
[13:34:15] <gcpeters> I see, not familiar with gravity forms, sorry
[13:34:44] <Gmac_> basically the submit button does stuff. using jquery.
[13:35:01] <Gmac_> i want to get those stuff working by using my own submit button which will trigger the regular submit button
[13:51:25] <BillCriswell> Space_: How about: $el.data('200', $el.data('600')); $el.removeData('600'); ?
[13:52:01] <Space_> if you use .data it doesn't actually remove anything
[13:52:12] <Space_> it just changes the jquery map
[13:53:44] <BillCriswell> Space_: So you want to actually change the data attributes values?
[13:54:03] <Space_> I want data-600 to become data-200
[13:54:10] <Space_> the keys persay
[13:55:13] <BillCriswell> .. $el.attr('data-200', $el.attr('data-600')); $el.removeAttr('data-600'); ?
[13:59:10] <BillCriswell> Space_: ^
[13:59:30] <BillCriswell> Can't rename an attribute, think that's as close as you're going to get.
[13:59:37] <Space_> right.
[14:00:45] <BillCriswell> Is that what you were going for?
[14:08:20] <Space_> right, checkout the function, sorry for the crappy names with variables -> https://gist.github.com/lindleywhite/9bd5d609d84a437f3bc0
[14:20:28] <BillCriswell> Space_: I'd make a fiddle.
[14:30:16] <BillCriswell> Space_: http://jsbin.com/egaxek/1/edit This seems to be doing what you want.
[14:34:13] <initself> what does index actually mean here?
[14:34:14] <initself> var colIndex = $("thead tr th:contains('CYTD Rolling 24 Quote Status')").index();
[14:34:26] <initself> i want it to mean the index for the column of the table
[14:34:58] <BillCriswell> initself: That would be the index of the th that contains that text... so I think it would be 0?
[14:35:01] <initself> so i can then find the values for any successive <td> in that column
[14:35:06] <initself> the value i got was '41'.
[14:35:24] <BillCriswell> Oh... then I'd think the 41st column?
[14:35:35] <initself> but that doesn't make any sense
[14:35:42] <systemfault> .index() returns the zero-based index of all the nodes at the level that node is… (siblings)
[14:35:48] <initself> it might meant the 41st th of all ths on the screen
[14:36:04] <initself> what systemfault said
[14:36:32] <initself> how do i narrow it down so it just returns numbers of ths in that very table
[14:36:37] <initself> which would then give me my column index?
[14:36:53] <BillCriswell> initself: .prevAll().length perhaps?
[14:37:34] <BillCriswell> initself: http://jsbin.com/omucuz/1/edit This returns 4.
[14:38:17] <BillCriswell> initself: Your HTML be being a butt.
[14:38:52] <initself> .prevAll().length gives me 41 too
[14:38:55] <initself> time to validate!
[14:39:04] <BillCriswell> initself: That HTML has been a bad boy!
[14:39:09] <initself> hahahah
[14:44:47] <ali_> I've got a question on deferred objects, I've got a deffered object req = getJSON, and when I call this function $.when(req).done( function(date) { console.log(date);return date; }), it correctly logs the date but returns me another promise object, how do I get $.when to return the date for my function?
[14:45:52] <dabear> ali_: not possible, code should be async. or put the code that depends on the date inside your callback
[14:46:27] <dabear> $.when(req).done( function(date) { doSomeThingWith(date) /* function defined elsewhere*/ }
[14:48:38] <initself> BillCriswell: what I didn't make clear is that I have two tableson the page
[14:48:43] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/9Ys5r/3/
[14:48:55] <initself> the index for Butts, therefore, is 8
[14:49:18] <ali_> dabear: can you expand on the function defined elsewhere, I'm using an Ember model, and basically I need some function to return me this date
[14:49:46] <initself> i'm not sure why it's not 9
[14:50:54] <BillCriswell> initself: Hmmm..
[14:51:33] <ali_> is there anyway for me to call getJSON without using deferred objects?
[14:51:36] <BillCriswell> Well you'd need to select it with the table as the parent fo sho.
[14:54:33] <dcherman> ali_: no, it's asynchronous
[15:09:01] <naeluh> Hi  is there a way to get the date value for example 9/10/13 from the datepicker in jquery ui I have a form that is in stepped format and I want to display th4e value after each form element has been answered
[15:11:08] <naeluh> let me know if I can clarify
[15:54:49] <grafi> naeluh isnt the value from the datepicker already in the input field?
[15:55:04] <naeluh> hi grafi
[15:55:49] <naeluh> yeah it is but I want to get that value and put it in a div that is displaying the results of each question in the form
[15:56:34] <grafi> so basically copy all input values into a div for summary?
[15:56:44] <naeluh> correct
[15:56:48] <naeluh> before submit
[15:57:00] <naeluh> var date1 = $('input#visit1_date').val(); I tried this it didnt work
[15:57:11] <naeluh> $('#results7').html("<b>Date One:</b> " + date1);
[15:57:44] <grafi> have a fiddle with the code?
[15:57:57] <naeluh> grafi: yeah I can retrieve the value from the input
[15:58:42] <grafi> but you cant get it into the div?
[16:00:40] <naeluh> yeah exactly
[16:01:24] <grafi> so if you have give us the url to the jsfiddle :)
[16:03:33] <naeluh> ok let me put something together
[16:03:41] <AwesomePossum_> How can I easily sort an object that contains date data objects?
[16:04:57] <AwesomePossum_> This is a paste bin of the object http://pastebin.com/jn4LXC96
[16:05:29] <AwesomePossum_> I want to sort by start year -> month -> day and if that isnt enough then to end year -> month -> day
[16:06:18] <grafi> hm
[16:06:31] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/9Ys5r/4/
[16:06:42] <initself> i'm trying to call my external function
[16:06:43] <initself> $("button.cytd_rolling_24_toggle").on('click', hide_dead_contacts() );
[16:07:03] <initself> what i'm doing wrong with hide_dead_contacts() ?
[16:07:14] <AwesomePossum_> I actually think I am going to ignore this issue for now.  Sorry for bothering :)
[16:07:19] <grafi> try leaving the () out initself
[16:08:53] <initself> grafi++
[16:13:19] <zilly> Is there a way to target a div like you would if you clicked on an anchor with a name--but without actually changing the fragment or clicking on the anchor?
[16:14:09] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/9Ys5r/5/ << this prints both 'hide' and 'toggle' to console
[16:14:30] <initself> shouldn't it only print 'hide' because the 'toggle' will only occur on "click"?
[16:15:51] <initself> $("button.cytd_rolling_24_toggle").on('click', hide_dead_contacts('toggle') ); << hide_dead_contacts shouldn't execute, should it?
[16:18:30] <naeluh> ok grafi here it is http://jsbin.com/uqibus/1/edit just select no for everything and select club for the first one and it should get you to the date part that I am talking about
[16:25:50] <grafi> not exactly a minimal example :P
[16:27:45] <naeluh> ok yeah let me see if I can par it down and the thing is you can see that it is just spitting out the values below I just need to that with the dates
[16:28:31] <grafi> i mean the code you use should to the trick
[16:28:49] <grafi> but it seems to never actually be called when i select/change a date
[16:30:00] <blindMoe> is there a version of :hidden that does not include form elements of type=hidden?
[16:30:11] <naeluh> ok yeah I am just going to keep messing with it
[16:30:14] <naeluh> thanks
[16:30:20] <grafi> good luck
[16:30:26] <naeluh> yeah Ill get it
[16:30:50] <grafi> not that i know of blindMoe since type hidden is actually hidden :p
[16:31:09] <blindMoe> guess I'll just have to narrow down the selector
[16:31:11] <jarred> Hi. I have a page that can have more than 80 fields that require datepickers. Rather than create 80 different datepickers, how do I instantiate a single datepicker and it modifies a different field depending on which field displayed the datepicker? Do note that I'm not trying to optimize for the sake of optimization, the page loads very slowly because of all the datepickers (and formatting the dates in them)
[16:31:26] <grafi> thats always a good idea
[16:32:38] <initself> grafi: can you see why my function in .on() gets called?
[16:32:52] <grafi> why what when?
[16:32:54] <grafi> woot
[16:33:08] <initself> $("button.cytd_rolling_24_toggle").on('click', hide_dead_contacts('toggle') );
[16:33:16] <initself> hide_dead_contacts() runs on page load
[16:33:20] <initself> it should only run on click
[16:34:24] <grafi> well same problem as before, no?
[16:34:33] <initself> i am not sure.
[16:34:46] <initself> i have to be able to pass a parameter into my function
[16:35:40] <grafi> .on('click', function() { hide_dead_contacts('toggle); }) will work not sure if there is a more effective way
[16:35:57] <initself> ah, sh*t, that looks great
[16:36:08] <bobbo> anyone have a good idea on refactoring this small bit?
[16:36:18] <grafi> $("some selector").click({param1: "Hello", param2: "World"}, cool_function); @ initself
[16:36:24] <grafi> that works apparently
[16:36:25] <bobbo> $(function() {   $("form#evaluator").submit(function() {     var side1 = parseFloat($("input#side1").val());     var side2 = parseFloat($("input#side2").val());     var side3 = parseFloat($("input#side3").val());        $("li#"+triangleType(side1,side2,side3)).click();     if(isValid(side1,side2,side3) !== true){       alert("That is not a triangle.")     }     return false;   }); });
[16:36:44] <initself> grafi++
[16:37:11] <grafi> grafi++ is going to be a horrible programming language one day
[16:37:41] <grafi> bobbo for the love of all thats holy please use some sort of pastebin ...
[16:38:05] <bobbo> Sorry, noob. one second
[16:38:26] <bobbo> http://pastebin.com/icuCepew
[16:38:32] <bobbo> my apologies
[16:39:11] <initself> does anyone know how jquery actually "hides" tables rows when they are toggled, so that hidden rows can be identified as such?
[16:39:22] <initself> does it just apply a style to the row?
[16:40:16] <grafi> pretty sure it does set display:none
[16:40:23] <Fraz> isnt that the only way it could be done?
[16:40:37] <grafi> well
[16:40:41] <grafi> opacity: 0
[16:40:44] <grafi> visibility: hidden
[16:40:46] <grafi> ^^
[16:40:58] <Fraz> opacity would retain it height
[16:41:09] <grafi> so would visibility i think
[16:41:15] <Fraz> probably
[16:41:22] <Fraz> never used that
[16:41:27] <Fraz> display: none is most likeley
[16:41:32] <grafi> comes in handy from time to time
[16:41:55] <grafi> initself you should make a class for hidden rows and then toggle the class
[16:42:07] <grafi> so you can identify hidden rows by looking for the class
[16:42:26] <initself> you mean have my script apply the class, rather than use toggle?
[16:43:00] <Fraz> you dont even have to apply a class
[16:43:19] <Fraz> just $(blah).hide()
[16:43:36] <Fraz> or $(blah).show()
[16:43:40] <grafi> sure
[16:44:27] <Fraz> for hiding and displaying stuff applying a class is a bit overkill
[16:44:40] <initself> Fraz: he's helping me idenfity hidden records after the fact
[16:44:54] <Fraz> oh
[16:45:01] <grafi> but if you want to find out which rows are hidden dont you think $('.hiddenRow') is more effective than $(':hidden') ?
[16:45:28] <Fraz> yeh
[16:45:31] <initself> the latter seems ok with me....
[16:45:46] <Fraz> i thought he just wnted to hide and show stuff
[16:45:49] <grafi> you could obv do it both ways
[16:46:36] <initself> grafi: what's the selector for 'not hidden'?
[16:47:45] <grafi> :visible doesnt work?
[16:48:03] <initself> i am not sure
[16:48:11] <Fraz> depending on what youre doing, say a list with hidden or visible content. you can just hide all in the list and show the one that was clicked
[16:49:11] <Fraz> for an accordian style thing
[16:50:52] <grafi> :visible should work though, keep in mind that opacity:0 and visibility:hidden are considered visible ^^
[16:51:02] <armi> what if i would attach 1(!!!) onclick handler to the main div, instead of onclick handlers on each separate clickable element. Would it be bad for performance since all events need to bubble up, or is this not very resource-asking?
[16:51:31] <grafi> events bubble up anyways armi
[16:51:57] <armi> so there is no reason for me not to it like this? my ids holds enough info to do stuff
[16:52:32] <grafi> yes, no reason not to do it
[16:53:33] <Fraz> wouldnt attaching onclick on the seperate handlers actually be the worse thing to do?
[16:53:53] <grafi> jup
[16:54:27] <grafi> not a best practice in any case
[16:54:34] <Fraz> you should have told him that:P
[16:54:40] <grafi> meh
[16:54:58] <Fraz> im having a nightmare atm, trying to jquerify stuff in the wordpress settings api
[16:55:03] <Fraz> im in a big mess of code no
[16:55:04] <Fraz> w
[16:55:11] <grafi> he said hes attaching 1
[16:55:25] <grafi> so no difference either way
[16:55:35] <grafi> wordpress
[16:55:37] <grafi> brrrr
[16:55:39] <grafi> :)
[16:55:51] <Fraz> you dont like wordpress?
[16:55:57] <grafi> oh i love it
[16:56:05] <grafi> the code sucks though
[16:56:29] <Fraz> its cos it has so many apis and shit to do specifics
[16:56:35] <Fraz> and considered standard now
[16:56:48] <Fraz> in the wordpress community
[16:57:04] <grafi> wordpress is the standard of the wordpress community?
[16:57:06] <grafi> :O
[16:57:13] <Fraz> lol
[16:57:22] <Fraz> no certain ways of doing stuff is
[16:57:30] <Fraz> such as adding settings
[16:57:36] <Fraz> to your plugin or theme
[16:57:37] <grafi> ah i see
[16:57:40] <grafi> yeah
[16:57:56] <grafi> fits right into the spaghetti code that is wordpress
[16:57:57] <grafi> :p
[16:57:58] <Fraz> the standard is now the settings api, but its turning my project into a big confusing mess
[16:58:08] <Fraz> yeah heh
[16:58:34] <grafi> lucky me
[16:58:49] <grafi> i have spaghetti code of my own that is a big mess :D
[16:58:57] <Fraz> ive gotta have certain ids and classes on setting fields, and certain settings sections and then link all those up in js for my realtime theme preview
[16:59:23] <Fraz> i spent most of today just staring blankly at the screen
[16:59:28] <Fraz> confused by my own mess
[16:59:39] <grafi> poor you
[17:00:07] <Fraz> but coding shouldnt be like that:(
[17:00:29] <grafi> hard?
[17:00:32] <grafi> or confusing?
[17:00:33] <grafi> :p
[17:00:51] <Fraz> spaghettified
[17:00:54] <initself> .children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")")
[17:00:56] <grafi> :D
[17:01:11] <grafi> that looks evil
[17:01:12] <grafi> xD
[17:01:18] <initself> so i have to add :visible to that
[17:02:12] <Fraz> children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")").visible?
[17:02:13] <Fraz> :D
[17:02:21] <grafi> that a thing?
[17:02:35] <Fraz> .show
[17:02:37] <Fraz> pff
[17:02:48] <initself> http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[17:03:16] <initself> .is(':hidden')
[17:03:19] <initself> maybe that?
[17:03:20] <Fraz> doesnt show override everything?
[17:03:22] * initself tries.
[17:03:37] <Fraz> opacity, display: none etc
[17:04:05] <grafi> hm initself you want to select visible rows?
[17:04:07] <grafi> or what
[17:04:10] <Fraz> wait no i recall it not overriding opacity
[17:04:59] <Fraz> looks like he wants to just hide a specific row?
[17:05:16] <grafi> but tds are not rows
[17:05:25] <grafi> :P
[17:05:26] <initself> grafi: good point!
[17:05:43] <grafi> and single hidden table cells dont make any sense
[17:05:51] <initself> $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "")).children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")")
[17:05:58] <initself> looks like i need tr:visible
[17:06:15] <initself> can i chain that selector?
[17:06:26] <grafi> sure
[17:06:40] <initself> that didn't appear to do anything
[17:06:45] <grafi> hm
[17:06:52] <grafi> what are you doing exactly now?
[17:06:53] <grafi> ^^
[17:06:59] <initself> $("." + tableClass + " tr:visible" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : ""))
[17:07:00] <Fraz> lol
[17:07:21] <grafi> awesome xD
[17:07:48] <grafi> looks like it should work to me though
[17:07:49] <Fraz> what is hasHeader?
[17:07:56] <initself> Fraz: i dont freaking know
[17:08:01] <Fraz> lol
[17:08:09] <grafi> xD
[17:08:19] <initself> it's usually always true
[17:08:21] <grafi> apparently someone doesnt know how tbody works
[17:08:23] <grafi> :p
[17:08:25] <Fraz> well you got a ternary if statement going on there
[17:08:43] <initself> i dont know what false would even mean
[17:08:44] <Fraz> so you should know what hasHeader is
[17:09:03] <initself> Fraz: it's value is almost always 'true'
[17:09:12] <initself> actually: true
[17:09:21] <grafi> xD
[17:09:21] <initself> it's a boolean
[17:09:30] <Fraz> but you dont know what it is?
[17:09:41] <initself> it's seriously just a boolean that gets passed to that function
[17:09:47] <Fraz> oh ok
[17:10:07] <Fraz> seriousley?
[17:10:15] <initself> .tableclass tr:visible:gt(0)
[17:10:21] <initself> i guess that's the row selector
[17:10:48] <Fraz> grafi do you know what hes actually trying to do yet?
[17:11:03] <initself> i'm trying to total only the tds that are in 'visible' rows
[17:11:05] <grafi> obv selecting visible tablerows
[17:11:06] <grafi> :D
[17:11:22] <grafi> total as in count?
[17:11:23] <grafi> oô
[17:11:36] <initself> count the values in <td>, sum them
[17:11:44] <grafi> a i see
[17:11:55] <grafi> hm
[17:11:59] <initself> i'm sure there is a way better way to do it than I am doing it....
[17:12:01] <grafi> there must be an easier way :P
[17:12:57] <initself> http://pgsql.privatepaste.com/0be47eaceb
[17:13:01] <initself> that's my crazy code
[17:13:39] <initself> i'm gonna check how many tr:hidden rows there are in my code
[17:15:15] <initself> i am not sure about tr:hidden!
[17:15:33] <initself> actually, i am sure about it!
[17:15:58] <grafi> erm
[17:16:06] <grafi> when you total :visible
[17:16:11] <Fraz> $('#table-id td').each(function() { if($(this).is(":visible")) { // do shit }}); << something like this/
[17:16:11] <grafi> why do you need :hidden?
[17:16:12] <grafi> :p
[17:16:54] <initself> they both work.
[17:17:00] <initself> i am not sure why the totals aren't changing
[17:18:31] <initself> Fraz: that looks about right....
[17:18:40] <Fraz> $('#table-id td').each(function() { if($(this).is(":visible")) { total += $(this).html().toInt()??? }});
[17:18:50] <Fraz> dunno if toInt is a real thing:P
[17:19:10] <Fraz> but maybe you td content is a string so not adding up properly?
[17:19:26] <jimkeller> probably parseInt(val) instead of val.toInt()
[17:19:26] <jimkeller> iirc
[17:21:01] <initself> i have all kind of filters for the type of content
[17:21:11] <initself> which may or may not be necessary, but appear to work
[17:21:16] <initself> float/avg...
[17:21:33] <grafi> :D
[17:21:51] <grafi> $('#table').find('tr:visible').children('td:nth-child(2)').each
[17:21:59] <grafi> seems to work fine for my example xD
[17:22:16] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/D43sf/
[17:22:32] <grafi> the 2 would be your columnIndex obv
[17:23:08] <Fraz> initself are you trying to make excel in jquery?:D
[17:23:15] <initself> Fraz: yes
[17:23:26] <initself> I *also* have an Excel export!
[17:23:26] <Fraz> why not just use excel?
[17:23:27] <grafi> hm
[17:23:31] <initself> demanding users
[17:23:34] <grafi> xD
[17:23:41] <grafi> lawls
[17:23:48] <grafi> i hope they pay you well
[17:24:09] <Fraz> yeah, you cant even add totals from fields yet. excel is wayyyyy more advanced than that
[17:24:09] <jimkeller> this appears to be a thing.... http://code.google.com/p/jquerysheet/
[17:24:18] <naeluh> grafi: what about this http://jsbin.com/uqibus/1/edit so I am trying to just get the value in a div and no go
[17:24:24] <Fraz> i had someone ask me to do something simalar in an old project
[17:24:28] <Fraz> i said
[17:24:29] <Fraz> noooooooo
[17:24:36] <Fraz> unless they paid me extra
[17:24:39] <Fraz> and they didnt want to
[17:25:13] <Fraz> ignore demanding users
[17:25:27] <Fraz> the user will always demand
[17:25:41] <Fraz> to excess
[17:26:24] <initself> i'm getting paid extra
[17:26:43] <Fraz> extra enough?
[17:27:16] <initself> jimkeller: that thing looks neat! thanks
[17:27:28] <Fraz> seems like reinventing the wheel. i refuse to reinvent the wheel for my clients. just get an opensouce thing that does what you want
[17:27:32] <Fraz> and intergrate that
[17:27:35] <Fraz> and charge the same
[17:27:44] <initself> let me just get this basic thing fixed and then i'll think about it
[17:29:25] <grafi> Fraz: charge double :P
[17:29:34] <Fraz> lol grafi
[17:29:39] <grafi> what?
[17:29:40] <grafi> ^^
[17:29:40] <naeluh> triple
[17:30:09] <grafi> naeluh i still cant see the checkfields function actually being called :o
[17:30:32] <Fraz> i would, but i dont want bad feedback "hey this guy used existing shit and charged me a fee as if he made it himself"
[17:30:34] <naeluh> reload the page I changed it
[17:30:39] <grafi> oh, ok :p
[17:30:53] <naeluh> thanks so much

[17:34:00] <Tomashe> hey guys wondering about which tool is the best when talking about createing mobile app using html5/js
[17:34:06] <naeluh> how about we all do it and split
[17:34:08] <Fraz> no?
[17:34:09] <grafi> i guess everybody has a price :P
[17:34:14] <Tomashe> i got really confused about all the solutions that outthere
[17:34:30] <naeluh> phonegap
[17:34:42] <Fraz> hes not a client
[17:34:45] <Fraz> he has a client
[17:34:47] <Fraz> :P
[17:34:49] <naeluh> oh
[17:34:56] <Tomashe> what other options there are ?
[17:35:12] <naeluh> objective c
[17:35:14] <Tomashe> there are others like phonegap. and does tit cost?
[17:35:22] <Tomashe> im not talking about Nativ
[17:35:23] <grafi> subjective d
[17:35:31] <Tomashe> Native*
[17:35:33] <Fraz> tomashe maybe you shouldnt be in a jquery channel
[17:35:45] <Tomashe> im just asking :)
[17:35:49] <Fraz> what kind of app do you want to make?
[17:35:51] <Tomashe> though u are borred
[17:35:58] <Fraz> game? normal app?
[17:35:59] <Tomashe> Fraz is that matter?
[17:36:02] <Tomashe> normal app
[17:36:03] <Tomashe> not game
[17:36:23] <Fraz> got any programming experience?
[17:36:24] <initself> something is funky here!
[17:36:28] <Tomashe> i heard mobiapp is good for games ... but im into regular app with acces to camera , storge and gps
[17:36:41] <Tomashe> im php/html/css/javascript
[17:36:41] <Tomashe> :)
[17:37:14] <Fraz> appgamekit.com, mainly for games but it has an api for the camera and stuff...and cross platform
[17:37:32] <Fraz> you can build any kind of app in it really
[17:38:04] <Tomashe> hmm , it compile it so i can put it on appstore and google store?
[17:38:13] <Fraz> yes
[17:38:28] <Fraz> and supports native code if you use tier 2 (c++)
[17:38:30] <Tomashe> and whats the diffrence from phonegap?
[17:38:45] <Fraz> dunno. never used anything else:P
[17:39:07] <Tomashe> ohh i c , im not c++ coder :/
[17:39:23] <Fraz> well tier 1 is a basic like language
[17:39:50] <Fraz> very easy to use
[17:40:18] <Tomashe> i really wanna use html/js which im familiar with already
[17:40:27] <Tomashe> not into learn something new atm
[17:40:44] <Fraz> hm
[17:41:06] <Fraz> a mobile phone app made in html and js
[17:41:11] <Fraz> i wont be buying that:P
[17:41:21] <Tomashe> thats what phonegap offering
[17:42:06] <Fraz> i guess it would be cool for specific apps
[17:42:31] <Fraz> like one of those boring resteraunt finders
[17:42:43] <Fraz> apps that are basically websites.....in an app
[17:42:44] <Fraz> :S
[17:43:04] <Tomashe> not games for sure
[17:43:05] <Tomashe> ::_)
[17:43:21] <Fraz> well appgamekit has camera access
[17:43:29] <Tomashe> phonegap too
[17:44:35] <Fraz> well it has access to everything on a load of platforms
[17:44:54] <initself> grafi: it's totaling a td from another table!
[17:44:55] <Fraz> and utilizes ogl
[17:45:07] <initself> it's been working all this time
[17:45:10] <grafi> xD
[17:45:15] <initself> console.log() helped!
[17:45:17] <initself> grafi++
[17:45:22] <initself> now i have to stop this madness!
[17:45:22] <grafi> man
[17:45:29] <initself> and probably use $(this)
[17:45:35] <grafi> i should be rich
[17:45:46] <initself> grafi: you are in karma
[17:45:49] <Fraz> i told him to use this
[17:45:51] <Fraz> $this
[17:45:55] <initself> Fraz: sorry
[17:45:55] <Fraz> i accept paypal
[17:45:57] <initself> i'll do it now.
[17:45:57] <jimkeller> Tomashe: Have you looked at Appcelerator Titanium?
[17:46:02] <grafi> that doesnt feed the pidgeons though
[17:46:11] <jimkeller> had some experience with it a few years ago. It seemed promising but at the time was very much not ready for primetime
[17:46:28] <jimkeller> however, it's a cross-platform app development system that's built on top of js/css
[17:46:32] <jimkeller> (more or less)
[17:47:03] <initself> console.log( $("." + tableClass).find('tr:visible' + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "")).children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")"));
[17:47:03] <Fraz> theres no perfect app development thinggy out there really
[17:47:10] <Fraz> always gonna have limitations
[17:47:20] <grafi> so make one
[17:47:21] <initself> so .tableClass is matching two tables
[17:47:24] <grafi> get rich
[17:47:34] <Fraz> meh
[17:47:40] <grafi> i pity you initself :D
[17:47:49] <initself> i know!
[17:47:51] <initself> me too!
[17:47:54] <grafi> xDD
[17:49:08] <grafi> maybe i should close youtube and do some work
[17:49:11] <grafi> nah
[17:57:54] <initself> HELS YA
[17:58:00] <initself> grafi++ # thank you so much!
[17:58:19] <grafi> np :P
[17:58:27] <Fraz> grafi theres too much funn stuff o youtube
[17:58:44] <grafi> hm
[17:58:51] <grafi> is there?

[18:02:10] <grafi> xD
[18:02:39] <Fraz> lol
[18:03:45] <nhmood> Is it possible to .delay() a .trigger() event?
[18:04:08] <nhmood> Or do I have to use the setTimeout function
[18:06:17] <grafi> setTimeout ftw
[18:06:44] <nhmood> Is there a reason .delay() doesn't work
[18:06:56] <grafi> delay is for the effects queue afaik
[18:07:09] <nhmood> ohhh, that makes sense
[18:07:26] <nhmood> thanks for the info!
[18:15:25] <Fraz> gafi

[18:15:50] <Fraz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRAYccnyfkY
[18:15:56] <d0den> when you replace a class with jquery, why are jquery commands not triggered by the new class? short example: http://jsbin.com/icajag/1/edit
[18:16:02] <initself> i love the title of that one
[18:16:28] <initself> i love the look of concencration
[18:16:32] <grafi> oO
[18:16:38] <grafi> dafuq Fraz
[18:16:39] <grafi> xD
[18:16:44] <Fraz> seeeeee
[18:16:46] <d0den> even though the class changes from one to two, clicking it again still brings up the alert for one, not two
[18:16:48] <Fraz> youtube is fun
[18:16:57] <initself> what in the fuck was that!?
[18:17:16] <Fraz> dunno but my nasal cavities feel clear just from watching it
[18:17:21] <initself> Joe Taylor 10 hours ago
[18:17:22] <initself> He disnt have degusting hygeine or anything, its a bunch of scar tissue from a previous operation﻿ in his nose that had got built up and the snot just covered it.
[18:18:12] <Fraz> lol i thought it was  a big bug or something that got up his nose
[18:18:20] <grafi> .two is length 0 on document ready and the element you bound the "you clicked one" to still exists
[18:18:23] <grafi> d0den+
[18:18:27] <grafi> -+ oô
[18:19:05] <Fraz> its a nosegasm
[18:19:07] <d0den> grafi, thank you, how would I go about implementing this in a way that works?
[18:20:32] <grafi> you just want it to alternative between you clicked 1 and you clicked 2?
[18:20:43] <d0den> also, how does the first element still exist when I changed it's class? the alert is bound to the class and the class is now tow
[18:21:18] <d0den> grafi, yes, I want it to alternate the class such that I can tie different actions to each alternate when clicked. It's for a play/pause button
[18:21:43] <grafi> i imagine $('.one') gives you an element from the dom, and you bind to that element, at document ready
[18:21:54] <Fraz> another one for you grafi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWT3jj3shNs
[18:22:13] <grafi> once its bound nobody cares if it still has the correct class
[18:22:37] <d0den> grafi, I see, I've been using document ready but I suppose I didn't really think about what it meant. I understand now, but can't think of the correct method to achieve this functionality
[18:23:09] <grafi> thats nothing specific to document ready, would be the same wihtout it
[18:23:35] <grafi> the handlers are bound whenever the code runs
[18:24:50] <grafi> so you probably want to reduce that to one handler, and then check for the class inside the handler
[18:25:11] <grafi> if($(this).hasClass('xyz')) or something
[18:29:21] <Fraz> grafi grafi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6Jv9vDk8t8
