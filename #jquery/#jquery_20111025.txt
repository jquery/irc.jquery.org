[00:00:10] <Eviltwin> Oh...
[00:00:16] <Eviltwin> onClose
[00:00:19] <Eviltwin> Instead of onSelect
[00:00:21] <Eviltwin> They did implement it
[00:00:25] <Eviltwin> I just tried it
[00:00:32] <Eviltwin> You should have been able to figure that one out :P
[00:01:29] <dwarder> Eviltwin: :)
[00:05:14] <Xian_> Hey guys, any reason why this functions wouldn't be working for some reason. It works on ready if I take out .click.
[00:05:15] <Xian_> $('document').ready(function(){
[00:05:15] <Xian_>          $('#close-search').click(function(){
[00:05:16] <Xian_>             $('#main-wrap').animate({top:'-50%'}, 2000);
[00:05:16] <Xian_>          });
[00:05:16] <Xian_>       });
[00:05:55] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready
[00:06:01] <Eviltwin> Not $('document').ready
[00:06:38] <Xian_> thanks, good to know. unfortunately still not working
[00:08:01] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[00:08:03] <Xian_> it is targeting a div. there shouldn't be anything wrong with that right?
[00:08:14] <Xian_> I made a jsfiddle and it worked
[00:08:16] <Eviltwin> Does the div have an id of "close-search"?
[00:08:22] <Xian_> but I just copied and pasted directly from my site
[00:08:27] <Xian_> yeah
[00:08:35] <Eviltwin> Does the div exist at load?
[00:08:41] <cratos> hello ... i'm trying to build an array of collapsible sections - http://jsfiddle.net/UtF7p/
[00:08:42] <Xian_> yup
[00:08:47] <Eviltwin> Then I have no idea
[00:08:49] <Eviltwin> But I gotta go
[00:08:53] <Xian_> fasho
[00:08:55] <cratos> the sections aren't coming up
[00:08:56] <Xian_> thanks for the help
[00:09:28] <mekwall> cratos: if you are going to use jsfiddle, at least learn how to use it.
[00:09:58] <cratos> I apologize, mekwall. I'm a novice
[00:12:11] <mekwall> cratos: check the jQuery examples in the left sidebar and you'll probably figure a couple of things out by yourself
[00:12:26] <cratos> thanks mekwall. I'll check them out.
[00:13:36] <mekwall> Xian_: instead of using $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); just do $(function(){ ... });
[00:13:51] <Xian_> k, I'll try
[00:14:14] <mekwall> Xian_: will probably not solve your problem, but its less code :)
[00:14:32] <Xian_> ahhh, it didn'tâ€¦but thanks for the tip anyways
[00:14:46] <Xian_> I think I must have a conflicting script in my code somewhere
[00:14:55] <mekwall> Xian_: sounds plausible
[00:15:03] <Xian_> working in fiddle so not sure
[00:15:24] <mekwall> Xian_: and no errors thrown?
[00:15:35] <mekwall> Xian_: how are you including jquery?
[00:15:54] <Xian_> it's thru the google cdn
[00:16:00] <Xian_> could that be a problem?
[00:16:13] <mekwall> Xian_: no... that should be fine
[00:16:31] <mekwall> Xian_: mind pasting all the html of that page?
[00:17:03] <Xian_> yeah, one sec
[00:21:13] <mekwall> lol
[00:21:21] <mekwall> he did paste all of the html code
[00:21:23] <mekwall> in a private convo
[00:21:24] <mekwall> :D
[00:21:40] <mekwall> Xian_ \o/
[00:21:49] <karstenk1977_> what did i make wrong?
[00:21:51] <karstenk1977_> function showCrop(el) {   jQuery(el.up('.crop')).css({'overflow':'visible','height':'auto'}) }
[00:21:53] <mekwall> Xian_: don't post it here on IRC :) use a paste service
[00:22:04] <mekwall> Xian_: jsfiddle or whatever works as long as I can see all of the code
[00:22:42] <Xian_> k, sorry. Just getting into javascript/jqueryâ€¦â€¦little slow still
[00:22:58] <mekwall> KarateKip3: .up?
[00:23:05] <karstenk1977_> el.up is not a function error source line: [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten] jQuery(el.up('.crop')).css({'overflow':'visible','height':'auto'})
[00:23:07] <mekwall> oops
[00:23:19] <mekwall> karstenk1977_: which is right... it is not a function
[00:23:30] <mekwall> karstenk1977_: where did you get that from?
[00:27:21] <clir-in> hi i need help again..
[00:27:21] <clir-in> http://jsfiddle.net/P6Hnj/4/
[00:29:12] <mekwall> clir-in: and?
[00:29:41] <clir-in> i dont know how do this. i want to pass the date value in the <span> i created. like in onSelect
[00:30:49] <mekwall> clir-in: you do know you are setting global vars in that onSelect callback
[00:30:52] <mekwall> clir-in: ??
[00:31:09] <mekwall> clir-in: also, why are you setting them every time? why not just set them outside as local
[00:31:10] <clir-in> no
[00:31:42] <clir-in> i didnt know.
[00:32:40] <clir-in> actualy i have no idea mekwall. i new to jquery :(
[00:33:10] <mekwall> clir-in: new to javascript you mean?
[00:33:19] <mekwall> because what I just said has nothing to do with jQuery
[00:33:25] <mekwall> it's the basics of javascript
[00:33:26] <clir-in> both javascript and jquery.
[00:34:18] <clir-in> should i do "var varname" ?
[00:35:49] <clir-in> mekwall.. i just want to do to that. load the default date value from datepicker then put it inside span.. and the button add date should have the same function with onSelect. is it posible?
[00:35:51] <mekwall> clir-in: cleaning it up for you
[00:37:40] <clir-in> tnx mekwall
[00:38:09] <mekwall> clir-in: you want to pass the date from the span to the datepicker?
[00:39:03] <mekwall> clir-in: not sure I understand entirely
[00:40:13] <clir-in> no.. drom datepicker to span
[00:40:27] <clir-in> from*
[00:40:53] <mekwall> clir-in: doesn't that work already?
[00:41:19] <clir-in> yes.. when you click from datepicker
[00:41:44] <clir-in> but the button "add date" doesnt work.
[00:41:53] <mekwall> clir-in: ah, I see
[00:43:49] <clir-in> brb.
[00:46:38] <gnapy> Hi all
[00:49:02] <gnapy> I need help with the find method to catch element in an xml document :) The probleme is that everything is ok with chrome but it does not work with firefox :/ I think that my problem is related to namespaces in my XML and I want to find a way to use a find without worrying about namespaces (something like " (find("[nodeName='*:getImagesForPageReturn']") " Is there a way to do this ?
[00:49:12] <mekwall> clir-in: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6264 it's a bug :P
[00:49:45] <mekwall> clir-in: but its a wontfix so...
[00:50:29] <clir-in> so its not posible?
[00:51:40] <IfTrueElseFalse> how can I select all elements '.class' EXCEPT the ones that have a parent of '#id' so the opposite of limiting $('#id .class')
[00:52:20] <gnapy> nobody for my problem ? :'(
[00:52:46] <IfTrueElseFalse> gnapy: just joined, what is it?
[00:53:32] <gnapy> < gnapy> I need help with the find method to catch element in an xml document :) The probleme is that everything is ok with chrome but it does not work  with firefox :/ I think that my problem is related to namespaces in my XML and I want to find a way to use a find without worrying about  namespaces (something like " (find("[nodeName='*:getImagesForPageReturn']") " Is there a way to do this ?
[00:53:46] <VonLipwig> Hi, quick question. How do I send post data which contains an & via $.ajax?
[00:53:47] <coldhead> you've chosen a hard road to hoe, gnappers
[00:54:12] <drjones69> gnapy: $('.class not:(<hash>class)')
[00:54:36] <coldhead> VonLipwig: if you provide it in the data param -- $.ajax({... data: {foo: 'lol&aids'} ...}_ jQuery will encode it for you
[00:55:05] <drjones69> Sorry - wrong person, for IfTrueElseFalse - although, I just re-read your question and realised I answered wrongly, sorry :-(
[00:55:11] <gnapy> drjones69: i think your response is for IfTrueElseFalse
[00:55:11] <gnapy> :p
[00:56:36] <jtag> I think u guys are great, and jquery is great
[00:56:42] <IfTrueElseFalse> drjones69: yea i tried $('not:(#id) .class') it returns []
[00:56:46] * jtag opens a can of redbull
[00:57:20] <gnapy> I m afraid that I am alone with my $*#! bug :p
[00:57:25] <NodeX> $('.class').not("#id") ?
[00:57:42] <IfTrueElseFalse> NodeX: the #id is a parent
[00:57:47] <drjones69> IfTrueElseFalse - Yeah, realised your problem was slightly subtler (belive that will select elements of .class except for any which have id=id (ie. the elements, not the parents)
[00:58:00] <coldhead> jQuery wasn't really written with XML in mind
[00:58:14] <NodeX> IfTrueElseFalse : what are you trying to achieve ?>
[00:59:05] <mekwall> clir-in: its possible... soon there :)
[00:59:20] <mekwall> clir-in: jsfiddle is lagging behind
[00:59:41] <Kambfhase> IfTrueElseFalse: try this: $('.class').not(function(){ return $(this).parent().is('#id'); })
[00:59:49] <drjones69> IfTrueElseFalse ; what about excluding the parent from the context?  $('.class', $(':not(<hash>id) *'))
[01:00:01] <Morkel> What is a good technic to save a JSON request from a server and work on this data?
[01:00:07] <IfTrueElseFalse> NodeX: in jQ mobile I have multiple pages  which are all loaded into the dom on runtime, now I want to select all elements that match a selection  except on the currently active page
[01:00:59] <NodeX> I dont know about jquery mobile but what I wrote above will get all classnames except the ID defined
[01:01:58] <IfTrueElseFalse> NodeX:  I want to exclude the element which has a parent  with a given condition the element doesn't have an id
[01:02:00] <Kambfhase> drjones69: i doubt that'll work, coz $('.class', non-parent) will also find the grand children ie as long as the <body> is in hte context an element will be found
[01:03:08] <drjones69> kambfhase: I knew there was a reason I normally keep quiet until after I've had a coffee :-)
[01:03:25] <Kambfhase> coffee, good idea!
[01:03:38] <Kambfhase> 'instant human, just add coffee'
[01:03:42] <FND> stylistic question / sanity check: which would you prefer
[01:03:43] <FND> a) el.slideUp(function() { $(this).remove() });
[01:03:43] <FND> b) el.slideUp($.proxy(el.remove, el));
[01:04:50] <mekwall> clir-in: http://jsfiddle.net/P6Hnj/7/
[01:04:52] <mekwall> there you go
[01:04:56] <Kambfhase> i like a)
[01:05:51] <clir-in> that you so much mekwall :)
[01:05:54] <FND> Kambfhase: yeah, I figured (b) was a little too clever for its own good
[01:05:55] <clir-in> thank*
[01:06:15] <Kambfhase> FND: hm, mayybe there is an even easier way.
[01:06:17] <IfTrueElseFalse> Kambfhase: thanks was almost right  jQ('.class').not(function(){return jQ(this).parents('#id').length});
[01:06:29] <IfTrueElseFalse> because i needed to check all parents
[01:06:52] <drjones69> iftrueelsefalse: what about $('.class').not('<hash>id > .class')?  - and that's definately my last guess before I get some coffee in my veins ;-)
[01:08:33] <IfTrueElseFalse> drjones69:  oh, that workes to, except no need for  the '>' I'm not sure whether the id will be a parebt bit grandparent
[01:09:01] <drjones69> Coolio .
[01:09:46] <clir-in> mekwall, another thing.. how will you make the default value of datepicker will show in <span> before showing the datepicker or the whole page?
[01:11:15] <larsemil> is it possible to see which item of all children clicked one is? say i have four li, and i click the second, how can i know its the second i click?
[01:11:30] <coldhead> $(this).index()
[01:11:35] <coldhead> ?index @ larsemil
[01:11:35] <bot-t> larsemil, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[01:12:17] <FND> Kambfhase: I can't think of an alternative (other than moving the remove function to a separate var for readability)
[01:12:42] <Kambfhase> yeah, i have been fiddling, but my other idea didnt work.
[01:12:55] <FND> :)
[01:13:29] <larsemil> coldhead: thanks
[01:16:27] <mekwall> clir-in: http://jsfiddle.net/P6Hnj/8/
[01:18:24] <Kambfhase> Pro tip: Never do jQuery('div').slideUp($.fn.slideDown) totally floods the console
[01:18:34] <tomoyuki28jp> When there is a #foo in the #container, I want to trigger some event when a user click #container except the #foo area. How can I write the selector for that?
[01:19:42] <coldhead> you can;t tomoyuki28jp
[01:19:52] <coldhead> you have to test for it inside the event handler
[01:19:53] <clir-in> thank you again mekwall :)
[01:19:54] <Kambfhase> $('#containter).click(function( event){ if( $(event.target).not('#foo')){ doStuff() })
[01:20:01] <coldhead> like that ^^
[01:20:04] <coldhead> thx Kambfhase
[01:20:15] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: Kambfhase: thanks a lot!!
[01:20:22] <Kambfhase> i think there is  aplugin for that, like click outside our somethin
[01:20:45] <tomoyuki28jp> that helps me a lot. thanks
[01:20:52] <Kambfhase> np
[01:20:55] <tomoyuki28jp> :)
[01:21:28] <coldhead> ?g outerclick jQuery
[01:21:29] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery outerClick plugin - http://littleroom.se/playground/outerClick/
[01:22:08] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: thanks!
[01:26:13] <tomoyuki28jp> Is there a way to check if $(event.target) is inside of #foo?
[01:26:54] <coldhead> $(event.target).closest('#foo').length
[01:27:00] <coldhead> will be 1 or 0
[01:27:03] <Kambfhase> way to go ^^
[01:27:05] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: thanks!
[01:31:00] <burg> hello. i am trying to animate the width of some divs when i press menu buttons (actually i want to toggle the divs horizontally) - http://79.112.31.73/template/ -- it works perfectly fine on firefox, opera, but on chrome it won`t toggle the last div (from last button: about us ) -- do you have any idea why this is happening?
[01:31:07] <codecowboy> I have a couple of select boxes within a <ul> which slideToggles into view when you click the parent <li>. Clicking to select an option in Firefox (6) triggers the slideUp but not in other browsers. ANyone have an idea why / a workaround?
[01:31:49] <codecowboy> http://pastie.org/2754996
[01:33:18] <codecowboy> In Firefox you have to click and hold to select an option from the select box ^^
[01:35:38] <codecowboy> actually, same in IE9 ^^
[01:38:13] <coldhead> AWESOME FIRE ALARM
[01:39:51] <Kambfhase> burg: you could try sliding in only the not contant divs, but otherwise the code looks OK:
[01:41:16] <alex-> I want to include the checkout page on my website with jquery cart, but when I visit http://127.0.0.1/jcart/jcart.php    it just shows me a white page
[01:41:19] <burg> Kambfhase, sliding only what?
[01:42:28] <coldhead> alex-: when i visit that URL i see appalling pornography
[01:43:11] <alex-> True, 127.0.0.1 is your pc
[01:43:18] <alex-> But i'm running the site at my pc
[01:43:27] <alex-> Don't you understand that?
[01:43:33] <Kambfhase> forget it, wont work
[01:43:51] <alex-> Kambfhase: why not?
[01:44:02] <Kambfhase> that wasnt to you ;)
[01:44:09] <alex-> Oh
[01:44:12] <coldhead> all i know is that this pornography is filthy
[01:44:13] <burg> Kambfhase, did you see the page with chrome? in chrome last tab won`t open
[01:44:15] <coldhead> and i don't like it
[01:45:55] <Kambfhase> burg: yeah, weird.
[01:46:48] <burg> Kambfhase, i tried it in epiphany (with is also webkit based), and it has the same problem. i can`t test it on safari, unfortunately, because i only have linux
[01:49:10] <burg> Kambfhase, just figured a workaround: if i place an empty div after the ones with content  (so the div with aboutus content won`t be the last), it will work ok. do you have any other sugestion?
[01:51:51] <codecowboy> How can I prevent my click event from firing when I click the target's contents? I have tried event.stopPropagation() - had no effect. http://pastie.org/2754996
[01:52:33] <coldhead>   i don't see any sign of stopPropagation here
[01:52:41] <coldhead> so i dont know if you did it right
[01:52:54] <NodeX> attach it to the <A> for a start
[01:53:13] <NodeX> then use click(function(event) { event.preventDefault() }
[01:53:28] <NodeX> that will stop the <a> from firing to #

[01:58:23] <aaronmcadam> not so sure the thead element actually gets a height
[01:58:33] <aaronmcadam> but u could get the height of it's children
[01:58:44] <Xotix> AaronCampbell: â€¦.
[01:59:22] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[01:59:38] <Xotix> of course. also if i try to get the outerhigh and thereis no border set, does jquery return 0?
[01:59:40] <codecowboy> coldhead: thanks, I was able to get round it by attaching it to the link instead
[01:59:55] <coldhead> good job codecowboy :)
[02:00:03] <coldhead> i love the solutions where i don't have to do anything
[02:00:07] <coldhead> they're my favourites

[02:12:17] <constantin_mike> hello. for jquery ui calendar, i've seen it has 2 sizes: the standard size is bigger, but the calendar in the demo is smaller
[02:12:22] <constantin_mike> how do i make it smaller?
[02:12:27] <aaronmcadam> melkornemesis: bbackone's not loading properly
[02:12:37] <Kambfhase> mattyh88: http://pastebin.com/hGCFmgQm
[02:12:50] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: do you know how to fix that please?
[02:13:00] <aaronmcadam> I'm lookin
[02:13:48] <mattyh88> Kambfhase: what does the length do? :o
[02:14:18] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: underscore is missing :/
[02:14:19] <melkornemesis> sorry
[02:14:25] <Kambfhase> well $() returns a pseudo array which is always truthy, so we have to check if the array actually contains any elemenets
[02:14:25] <aaronmcadam> ahah!
[02:14:36] <mattyh88> ah okay thx !
[02:14:44] <aaronmcadam> melkornemesis: did u add it
[02:14:52] <Kambfhase> np
[02:15:05] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: i did not, i'm goin to
[02:15:47] <drjones69> constantin_mike : Did you get a solution to reducing the size of jquery UI datepicker - it's something that's been bugging for a while (more out curiosity than a current need)
[02:16:04] <drjones69> constantin_mike : Did you get a solution to reducing the size of jquery UI datepicker - it's something that's been bugging for a while (more out curiosity than a current need)
[02:16:25] <constantin_mike> drjones69: no
[02:16:36] <drjones69> bugger ;-)
[02:16:38] <constantin_mike> drjones69: the default size is huge, but the one in the demo is just perfect
[02:16:49] <drjones69> I know exactly what you mean
[02:16:58] <constantin_mike> so, nobody knows how to get to that?
[02:17:20] <Xotix> $('#editor table thead').children().height(); returns me 25 which seems to be the offsetHeight. What's the offsetHeight? Somehow i can't find an attribute for the height in the object for the child's.
[02:17:50] <coldhead> trying standing further away from the monitor
[02:18:00] <seutje> Xotix: wat?
[02:18:16] <seutje> any chance ur looking for .attr('height')?
[02:18:22] <aaronmcadam> melkornemesis: got it
[02:18:42] <aaronmcadam> melkornemesis: http://jsfiddle.net/4cTFk/7/
[02:19:21] <Xotix> basically yes but this gives me an undefined.
[02:19:52] <drjones69> constantin_mike:  It's been bugging me ages, glad to gave me the impetus to finally look it up, just set the font-size for .ui-datepicker (either in the theme css), or elsewhere as : .ui-datepicker {font-size: 0.6em !important}
[02:20:14] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: thank you man, you saved the day :)
[02:20:26] <aaronmcadam> no worries
[02:20:32] <Xotix> if i take a look at the object from thead  there is no attribute height in the attributes list of the child's.
[02:20:36] <aaronmcadam> are u starting with backbone?
[02:21:10] <constantin_mike> drjones69: let me check
[02:21:47] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: yes i am, it looks pretty awesome and takes the javascript for me to a new level :)
[02:21:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah

[02:22:37] <coldhead> how does this code know my name is Michal?
[02:22:46] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: yeah, thanks for that, i am just looking at it, exactly what i have been looking for
[02:22:55] <ravenzz> suppose that I have 2 submit buttons, and I want to perform an ajax req when the button 1 is clicked (instead of a regular form submission), should I trigger the click() event on that button or is there a better way to do that by triggering the submit() event?
[02:22:56] <seutje> magicoads
[02:23:03] <aaronmcadam> it is coldhead?
[02:23:13] <coldhead> no, that's a good point aaronmcadam
[02:23:14] <coldhead> it isn't
[02:23:20] <coldhead> but it fooled me

[02:30:03] <drjones69> With an Ajax request (jquery initiated or otherwise), is it possible to return a multiple partial responses without completing the response?  I have a page element I wish to update as the server completes a number of (non-trival) server-side activities - ideally I'd like to update it after each server-side process completes (to inform the user of progress)
[02:30:29] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: i've already read the last page, i've got through few tutorials and still reading, justed wanted to try at least a little piece of code on fiddle
[02:30:38] <shesek> drjones69, take a look at websockets and comet
[02:31:04] <shesek> drjones69, and no, AFAIK, its not possible with ajax
[02:31:17] <drjones69> Websockets I've at least heard of, but what's comet?
[02:31:31] <blackspotwiggins> shesek, drjones69 it is possible
[02:31:34] <blackspotwiggins> with chunked ajax
[02:31:35] <drjones69> 'sall right, I've found it ;-)
[02:31:58] <drjones69> Chunked ajax?  Sounds somewhat vomit-inducing ;-)
[02:32:20] <shesek> Before WebSockets, its was a common way to push data to clients over an opened connection, using an iframe
[02:32:43] <coldhead> it sounds like a really nice bass amp, drjones69
[02:32:48] <shesek> basically, just an invisibly iframe that stays open, sends `<script>` tags and flushes the response
[02:32:55] <coldhead> lol flush
[02:33:00] <drjones69> Cheers folks - given me some starting points to start reading up on :-)
[02:34:33] <shesek> drjones69, some websockets libraries use websockets or flash-sockets when available, and fallback to comet
[02:34:49] <shesek> one of those libraries is probably the easiest way to go
[02:34:58] <blackspotwiggins> socket.io
[02:35:41] <drjones69> Aye, literally just came across socket.io as you mentioned it blackspotwiggins ;-)
[02:35:51] <aaronmcadam> melkornemesis: yeah dude go play
[02:36:51] <shesek> yeah, I've heard good things about socket.io (since I mostly develop intranet apps, and all of our workers use Chrome/Firefox, I don't need that myself - I can just use WebSockets directly)
[02:37:25] <Xotix> Still don't get it. I need the height of tbody. Any ideas? I tried it like $('#editor table thead').children().height(); or children().attrb('height); but nothing.
[02:37:27] <shesek> that's one of the great things when developing stuff to be used in-house :D
[02:37:54] <shesek> Xotix, how would the children of <thead> be the <tbody> ?
[02:38:04] <drjones69> shesek:  Any good (introductory) resources you know (off the top of your head) - project is inhouse for a pitch/demo, so will be enforcing use of Chrome or FF for the time being
[02:38:12] <Xotix> sry misspelled me o.O somehow i mean thead
[02:38:51] <shesek> drjones69, if that's the case, just read about WebSockets at MDN
[02:39:03] <shesek> drjones69, why children() than?
[02:39:19] <coldhead> then*
[02:39:31] <shesek> yeah, sorry, English is not my native language
[02:40:00] <drjones69> Shesek: Cheers - PS. think your 2nd message to me was meant for someone else.
[02:40:15] <aaronmcadam> ahaha shesek good catch
[02:40:16] <shesek> oh, yeah, that was at Xotix
[02:40:38] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Hi all. I have a strange jQuery behavior and cannot get what I'm doing wrong. Probably somebody could help me out.
[02:40:42] <Spinov_Evgeniy> I'm using jquery 1.4.2 and doing a dynamic web form. Appending new fields with append(). Appending elements to <tbody> inside the <form>. The strange thing is, that fields are added properly, seen at DOM, however, when the form is submitted, it contains only fields that were not appended by jQuery.
[02:40:46] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Looked through jQuery docs and forum posts, however no such problem seen. Any help is really appreciated. Thank you.
[02:41:26] <shesek> are they properly under the `<form>` element when you browse the DOM (using Firebug / Developer tools)?
[02:41:52] <larsemil> i am using window.setInterval to trigger a function. If i click something in the area the interval is run in, i'd like to make interval start over.
[02:42:05] <larsemil> with that i mean: if i three seconds in click, i'd like the interval to start over at 5 seconds
[02:42:07] <shesek> Spinov_Evgeniy, does $(..form..).find(':input') finds them?
[02:42:10] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Yea the are in proper place. Inside the <form>
[02:42:18] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Let me check
[02:42:19] <larsemil> i am using window.setInterval to trigger a function. If i click something in the area the interval is run in, i'd like to make interval start over.
[02:42:22] <larsemil> with that i mean: if i three seconds in click, i'd like the interval to start over at 5 seconds
[02:42:31] <Xotix> shesek didn't work without but i^ll try again. thanks
[02:43:30] <shesek> larsemil, (function(){  var timer; $('#foo').click(function(){  timer && clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(...., 3000);  })  })()
[02:44:18] <shesek> (the anonymous function is to keep the timer in a private scope, instead of cluttering the global scope with it. if you're already inside your own scope, no need for it)
[02:45:15] <larsemil> shesek: that is not to be used with setInterval?
[02:45:32] <shesek> larsemil, or you can use underscore.js and simply do $('#foo').click(_.debounce(function(){ ... }, 5000))
[02:46:09] <shesek> setInterval calls it repeatedly every X miliseconds. if I understand you correctly, you only want to call it once, don't you?
[02:47:20] <larsemil> no.like this. every 5 seconds my slider change image. If anyone pressed the controlbuttons, i dont want it to change directly again if they pushed the controllbutton 4 seconds into the cycle
[02:47:27] <coldhead> youre some kind of pure helpful gold, shesek
[02:47:30] <coldhead> goddess bless you
[02:48:08] <shesek> coldhead, thanks :-)
[02:48:22] <shesek> larsemil, than yeah, same code, but replace with setInterval
[02:48:41] <shesek> Simply stop and start the timer when its clicked
[02:58:09] <inad922> how can I open a file upload window with javaswcript
[02:58:12] <inad922> ?
[02:58:48] <Spinov_Evgeniy> 2shesek: I've tried to access form via .....find(':input'), but object returned seems to be empty ( it's to big to click everywhere in console, but length is 0). Probably I'm misusing it or there is any other way to check that DOM is in proper state? Each input element has ID, as well.
[03:00:29] <NodeX> <input id="foo" type="text" /> <span class="next"></span> ... $("#foo").next(".next"); .. am I losing my mind ?
[03:00:42] <NodeX> ?next
[03:00:42] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[03:05:29] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Even $(..form..).find(..input_id..).val() returns undefined. While $(..input_id..).val() returns normal stuff. input_id though is the element which is submitted properly.
[03:09:00] <azorai> Spinov_Evgenity, are you passing a string to .find() or an actual element?
[03:10:13] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Fixed. I've put form inside the <table> before the <tbody>. For some reason, form was completely empty. I cannot get how the static fields were passed though
[03:10:26] <Spinov_Evgeniy> I've put form before the table at it worked at once.
[03:10:35] <Spinov_Evgeniy> Thanks everyone who helped

[03:25:40] <bilel8> i would like to integrate jquery ui in my site but when i downlood the file , it was contains mainy other files i dont know how to use ? Please helps :(

[03:34:24] <jhaddad> soâ€¦ lets start by saying i know nothing whatsoever about front end development.  i've added jquery UI to a simple 1 page site, and I'm using the tab feature in my left column.  the data in the right doesn't have tabs, but id like to use the rounded corners on the div layer.  is there an easy way to do that?
[03:35:56] <Aamir> ?jhaddad  use css classes like ui-corner-all, ui-corner-tl etc have a look at jQuery UI theme.css file
[03:35:57] <bot-t> Aamir, Couldn't find "jhaddad use css classes like ui-corner-all, ui-corner-tl etc have a look at jQuery UI theme.css file" in jQuery Docs.
[03:36:00] <href> what? when i added                                             <ajaxToolkit:DropShadowExtender to the "myTools

[03:38:49] <ttt_> hi all, having a slight issue wondering if anyone else has ever seen such a thing googling yields no results. I am using an accordion widget within a container the widget renders with auto width in ie8 and looks perfect however in ie7 it only renders to the width of the content, even stranger is that in ie quirks mode it renders fine again with auto width. I have tried adding a class to the relevant divs and h3s width width:auto but i
[03:43:35] <jhaddad> Aamir: that worked, thanks!
[03:43:42] <Aamir> cool :)
[03:44:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have an image on a page and want to display a NEXT icon on the right side of it, but only when the image is hovered... The next button should overlay the image itself... does anyone know how to approach this?
[03:47:08] <ravenzz> ecky--ptang-zoob it is doable in plain css
[03:47:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can u give an example?
[03:48:55] <ravenzz> ok, hold on
[03:49:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx much
[03:51:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can it also be position vertically centered on the right edge? Should display an arrow image
[03:52:24] <yango> I should be able to attach a click() handler to a button element, right?
[03:52:55] <yango> (I ask because it is not attaching now)
[03:53:02] <NodeX> yep
[03:53:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes yango
[03:54:08] <yango> weird
[03:54:26] <ravenzz> ecky--ptang-zoob http://jsfiddle.net/kwFCC/
[03:55:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok that looks good
[03:55:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i"ll give it a shotr
[03:56:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what does this do? text-indent:-9999px;
[03:56:16] <ravenzz> it "hides" the text within the link
[03:56:51] <ravenzz> "Next Image"
[03:56:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aah
[03:57:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[03:57:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx )
[03:57:06] <ravenzz> yw
[03:59:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ravenzz: the arrow will overlay the image... is it possible to give it a 50% opacity background?
[04:00:32] <koichirose> Hi, how do I get something like this to work? http://pastie.org/2755526 I'd like to mix jquery elements and strings. If I remove 'blah' it works, displaying an image inside a div.
[04:00:33] <ravenzz> can't you wrap that on a square or something?
[04:01:13] <ravenzz> ecky--ptang-zoob I have to go, if you want to do that in css, ask on #css
[04:01:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok thx :)
[04:06:15] <yango> So, how do I debug a click event not being attached?
[04:06:43] <yango> Should I go to the definition of click() or is there a debug variable?
[04:07:14] <PrgmrBill> yango: a good start would be console.log($('#your_selector').length);
[04:07:17] <PrgmrBill> see if it matches
[04:12:32] <yango> it's not grabbing the selector
[04:12:35] <yango> which is weird
[04:12:42] <yango> because it is the id
[04:14:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ravenzz, still there? Got 1 issue
[04:18:01] <koichirose> Hi, how do I get something like this to work? http://pastie.org/2755526 I'd like to mix jquery elements and strings. If I remove 'blah' it works, displaying an image inside a div.
[04:22:11] <yango> I'm not sure how could double quotes be the problem
[04:22:29] <yango> i changed $("#myselector") to $('#myselector') and it now works

[04:54:31] <antihero> JKarsrud: Chrome
[04:54:51] <JKarsrud> antihero: Doesn't happen here, do you have a testcase?
[04:55:02] <Shapeshifter> Hi there. I created a very simple js-only tool ( http://ompldr.org/vYXl6dw ) that takes some values into a form and creates a HTML snippet from the input. Works fine, except that sometimes, the middle column disappears (because jquery seems to get caught in some weird recursive <pre> trap), creating output like this: http://pastie.org/2755745 lines 26 and 30. Any clues? You can run the js directly on ompldr to try it.
[04:57:45] <Shapeshifter> It happens randomly when just entering rubbish real quick. I assume it's some sort of race condition.
[04:59:03] <antihero> JKarsrud: Hmm

[05:50:34] <inad922> And can tell me what indicator is for? Because I thought it is for showing some text/image while uploading a file.
[05:50:49] <inad922> but just nothing happens no matter how I set it.
[06:07:04] <jen_> I'm sure this gets asked quite a bit.  On my download page, after the user clicks download, I need to either show them a lightbox with instructions to proceed to the next page or after the DL is clicked, automatically redirect to the next page. Is this the job for JS or JQ?
[06:07:58] <johnline3> jq
[06:08:59] <JKarsrud> jq is js
[06:10:22] <jen_> JQ has better compatibility across all browsers.
[06:12:04] <soee> someone who knows nivo slider maybe?
[06:14:21] <esya> Hi guys
[06:14:31] <esya> I'm having a weird issue with jQuery UI, here's the deal :
[06:14:42] <esya> I'm opening a dialog with the following dimensions : 450x300
[06:15:00] <esya> But when I inspect the box using chrome's built-in inspector
[06:15:10] <esya> It shows that the box's height is actually 227px
[06:15:17] <esya> I have no margin nor paddings inside the modal
[06:15:19] <esya> Any ideas.. ?
[06:15:32] <esya> I could add up 73px to the box's height but that wouldn't be a clean way to do it tho
[06:21:02] <esya> Anyone?
[06:21:11] <jeffsmykil> Are there any circumstances where code organization trumps having to load umultiple javascript files on page load?
[06:21:13] <xec> esya: not 100% sure on this, but i think the entire dialog box (excluding border/padding/margin) gets the height, not the content part of the dialog
[06:21:45] <esya> xec: Hmm. Seems like it doesn't for me :o
[06:22:41] <tman> is does $(document).width() get that value from the body attribute?
[06:22:42] <xec> esya: http://jsfiddle.net/aQ9bm/
[06:22:42] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: I'm currently working on a large web app.  and yes, code organization trumps load issues.
[06:23:09] <jeffsmykil> at what point does the optimization outweigh the organization?
[06:23:09] <esya> xec: Well here the box has 208px
[06:23:11] <esya> Of height
[06:23:30] <rroelofs> but it totally depends on your context.
[06:23:37] <xec> esya: firebug shows 201, not sure where the 1 px comes from tho
[06:23:45] <esya> Erh :/.
[06:23:51] <esya> Webkit says 208px
[06:24:00] <jeffsmykil> rroelofs: how many lines is your app?
[06:24:34] <xec> esya: chrome shows 200
[06:24:41] <esya> :o ?
[06:24:47] <esya> Let me show you a screenshot, hold on
[06:25:06] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: I will have to check.  It is surprisingly low because I'm pretty rabid about code reuse.
[06:25:17] <jeffsmykil> over 1k?
[06:25:27] <xec> esya: select the element with class name "ui-dialog" and under metrics it says 150x200
[06:25:30] <esya> xec: http://d.pr/wvhi
[06:25:34] <esya> Hm, yeah
[06:26:05] <esya> Well in mine it doesn't work as well
[06:26:06] <esya> :/.
[06:26:12] <xec> ye thats including padding (2x3px) and border (2x1px)
[06:26:25] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: over 1000 way under 100000
[06:26:51] <jeffsmykil> gotcha
[06:26:55] <rroelofs> and its early
[06:27:07] <jeffsmykil> im just over a thousand im not sure its worth breaking them up
[06:28:02] <xec> esya: you might want to create your own dialog code though, if you need more flexibility/control
[06:28:10] <xec> shouldnt be too hard
[06:28:18] <esya> Yah, guess I won't have any other choice :x
[06:28:27] <esya> Thanks anyway for helping me through this
[06:28:50] <xec> np
[06:29:31] * jeffsmykil has a bad habbit of not throwing away dead pens
[06:30:20] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: just counted... js (including libs) + css + html = 82,000
[06:30:35] <rroelofs> non-min
[06:31:15] <jeffsmykil> oh i didnt count css or html
[06:31:24] <jeffsmykil> err css or libs
[06:32:27] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: in my case, libs are about 32,000
[06:35:25] <rroelofs> jeffsmykil: what kind of app are you building?
[06:36:03] <jeffsmykil> i'm rewriting our flash/silverlight mapping application
[06:36:34] <rroelofs> good for you!  Can you reuse any of the actionscript?
[06:36:51] <jeffsmykil> the services
[06:36:57] <jeffsmykil> none of the actionscript
[06:37:04] <jeffsmykil> all asp.net services
[06:37:42] <jeffsmykil> i didnt write the original
[06:39:08] <rroelofs> in my case I'm replacing a desktop app that my boss and I wrote 12 years ago.
[06:39:23] <rroelofs> I've been having fun learning underscore and backbone.
[06:39:41] <beasty> morning all
[06:40:13] <jeffsmykil> yeah that means very little to me
[06:40:19] <jeffsmykil> im a designer by trade
[06:40:43] <jeffsmykil> learning js so the programmers fuck up less of my ideas
[06:41:04] <rroelofs> :-)  We would _never_ do that!
[06:41:14] <jeffsmykil> engineers, I'm sorry
[06:41:50] <beasty> anyone got a clue how i could manage to introduce a event listener?
[06:41:58] <rroelofs> I have a tiny bit of designer envy.  I know good work when I see it, but can't even draw a straight line
[06:42:19] <jeffsmykil> lol i can on a computer, my drawing skills on pen and paper are sub par at best
[06:42:48] <azorai> rroelofs, I can tutor you on how to draw a line. It'll take a couple hours.
[06:43:10] <jeffsmykil> (0,8) (0,4)
[06:43:14] <jeffsmykil> done!
[06:43:15] <azorai> rroelofs, Not everyone can do it though. Line drawing is an art.
[06:43:41] <rroelofs> :-)
[06:44:07] <azorai> jeffsmykil, the real challenge is parsing that DSL and running it through <canvas>'s JS API.
[06:44:07] <danner> I've got a table with tr's corresponding to database models. I want to get a list of database ids after I use sortables. to that end, i've currently created class="id_{{id}}" to store the id. is there a better way, or is there a way to retrieve those ids easily?
[06:44:49] <jeffsmykil> I have a canvas book on my desk I hope i never have to open it again
[06:45:06] <azorai> jeffsmykil, but it rocks so hard! y?
[06:45:35] <jeffsmykil> im sure it does
[06:45:45] <jeffsmykil> but the support for the browsers i have to develop for isn't there
[06:46:01] <jeffsmykil> and i think id rather do svg even if it was
[06:47:07] <azorai> jeffsmykil, indeed.
[06:48:11] <gnarf> danner: data-db-id="{{id}}"
[06:48:20] <gnarf> danner: .data("dbId") == id
[06:48:34] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, what's the browser where svg support is better than canvas?
[06:49:01] <gnarf> although the class is probably faster to search for a specific id
[06:49:11] <gnarf> the data attr will be quicker to read the id
[06:49:22] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: neither, thats why i dont use either
[06:51:01] <danner> gnarf, so there isn't a way to get a list, i was thinking like serialize() does it.
[06:51:22] <gnarf> danner: serialize uses the ID of the element
[06:52:18] <gnarf> danner: "getting a list" is as easy as matching some elements and then using .map
[06:52:29] <blackspotwiggins> surely that is not easy
[06:52:34] <azorai> gnarf, the `name`, not the `id`, no?
[06:52:41] <blackspotwiggins> we need a plugin
[06:53:01] <azorai> And what shall this mighty plugin do?
[06:53:01] <danner> blackspotwiggins, thanks, i'll take the map please.
[06:53:16] <gnarf> danner: for instance, using the class name like you were talking about
[06:54:10] <gnarf> elems.map(function() { var m = this.className.match( /id_(\d+)/ ); if (m) return m[1]; }).get()
[06:54:31] <MarcelT3> hey, is there a good free ajax irc client out there?
[06:54:43] <gnarf> MarcelT3: no
[06:55:05] <MarcelT3> too bad
[06:58:29] <danner> gnarf, thanks, thats ...thorough, you even gave me a regex :-)
[06:59:03] <Oggu> How can I access text nodes in IE7?
[07:01:47] <gnarf> Oggu: jQuery doesn't do much with text nodes, but you can get at the nodes via .contents
[07:02:03] <gnarf> Oggu: most of the selector functions, etc will ignore text nodes
[07:02:48] <Oggu> gnarf: contents() seems to ignore text nodes in IE7
[07:02:59] <sadmicrowave> hey is there an nth-parent() selector much like nth-child() ?
[07:03:06] <gnarf> Oggu: it shouldn't....
[07:03:15] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: .parents().eq(n)
[07:03:20] <sadmicrowave> nice
[07:03:29] <Oggu> gnarf: Or. at least it doesn't play well in firebug lite..
[07:03:43] <gnarf> Oggu: i'd think that might be more of the issue
[07:03:48] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, is that faster than $(this).parent().parent().parent()...?
[07:04:54] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: both would be pretty fast, anything more than 2 parents up, .parents().eq() is prolly faster
[07:04:58] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, it doesn't seem like it would be considering parents() first pulls the list of all parents in the DOM, then uses eq() to get the needed one
[07:05:32] <sadmicrowave> whereas .parent().parent() is traversing directly to the intended parent
[07:05:49] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: but pulling a "list of parents" is actually really damn fast
[07:05:52] <Oggu> Ok. Say I do get it. How do I change the text content?
[07:05:56] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, lol ok
[07:06:04] <gnarf> were as each call to .parent() is a function
[07:06:10] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: you could easily jsperf this
[07:06:12] <sadmicrowave> true
[07:06:29] <sadmicrowave> i know, and I plan on it, I just wanted to opinions first
[07:06:50] <Brodingo> so i want to equalize column height in 5 column increments
[07:07:00] <Brodingo> gnarf youre a smarty pants can i bounce something off ya
[07:08:11] <Brodingo> argh no that doesnt really work
[07:08:31] <gnarf> Brodingo: hrm
[07:08:44] <Brodingo> sorry hold on im still thinking
[07:08:49] <gnarf> Brodingo: i remember a pretty badass demo about sizing shit
[07:09:43] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: http://jsperf.com/parents-test
[07:09:51] <gnarf> try it on older browsers
[07:09:55] <gnarf> it prolly wont make much of a diff
[07:10:00] <gnarf> on newer onces
[07:13:30] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, http://jsperf.com/parent-vs-parents-eq you are right
[07:16:55] <JackBauer24> jQuery function $(this).prev("selector") seems to check only element which is next to $(this). How can I get the nearest previous element that matches selector?
[07:18:05] <sadmicrowave> if I have multiple classes on a div (i.e.: "ui-close ui-icon ui-thickbox") how can I check if the class of the element contains "ui-thickbox"? for instance if( this.getAttribute('class') == 'ui-thickbox' )... does not work
[07:19:18] <piyush> Hello
[07:19:30] <JackBauer24> http://pastebin.com/nXhgaWKE - here is example that shows what I mean, I want to select the hidden field

[07:20:14] <piyush> can anyone help me with some questions ?
[07:20:30] <sadmicrowave> ?ask @ piyush
[07:20:31] <bot-t> piyush, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:20:52] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, you are my best friend
[07:20:53] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Is that a question?
[07:20:57] <sadmicrowave> no
[07:21:03] <sadmicrowave> it is fact
[07:21:03] <khmer_> i wish we didn't have ESR in the bot
[07:21:05] <khmer_> that pustule
[07:22:05] <sadmicrowave> piyush, you can ask in the main room
[07:22:27] <sadmicrowave> piyush, that way, if I can't help you, maybe someone else can
[07:23:48] <gnapy> Hmm.. Somebody using webservices deployed with axis and tomcat ? When I'm using GET to query my WS, I am experiencing problems with parameter ordres.. Somebody already had this problem ?
[07:24:19] <piyush> I am a newbie in jquery....just wanted to ask what is the difference between jquery plugin and jquery UI...also if I wanted to use both in my personal webpage...how can I do thta ?
[07:24:43] <khmer_> piyush: jquery ui is a large jquery plugin
[07:24:52] <khmer_> piyush: really it's a family of plugins
[07:24:55] <sadmicrowave> ?plugin @ piyush
[07:24:55] <bot-t> piyush, (function($){ $.pluginName = function() { /* code */ }; $.fn.pluginName = function() { return this.each(function(){ /* code */ }); }; })(jQuery);
[07:25:02] <sadmicrowave> hmm, not what I wanted
[07:25:54] <sadmicrowave> piyush, plugins are functions that are not inherent in jquery's core but can be 'plugged-into' your page
[07:26:10] <Pessimism> I am learning to use jQuery AJAX with a Django project, but I am seeing a billion different ways to do it. Is there *one* preferable way to do it, with a style guide or something, or is it a free for all? $.post vs. $.ajax with different ways of passing the arguments, etc.
[07:26:26] <Pessimism> And if so, where is there a good (style) guide on this.
[07:27:08] <sadmicrowave> piyush, and as khmer_ said, jquery-ui is a large plugin that jquery developers built that comes with standard images, css styling, and ui action functions
[07:27:27] <sadmicrowave> er, ui action-events
[07:27:36] <sadmicrowave> whichever
[07:28:15] <piyush> Sadmicrowave, can u pls explain me in bit detail...
[07:28:58] <sadmicrowave> bit detail? 11100011 100110011 10000111011 1000110101 1011101011 ???
[07:29:14] <piyush> I am quite new to this...I am not able to get the high picture...like what is plugin and what is UI and how to use the plugin and UI which is tthere in jquery site nor any other site into my webpage
[07:29:37] <piyush> means more detail
[07:29:55] <sadmicrowave> first off, do you know what UI stands for?
[07:30:03] <b-lew> http://www.turnpost.com/corpcomm14 -> can someone help me slow down that auto rotate when you first get to this page?
[07:30:22] <piyush> yeah..UI means user interface....
[07:30:25] <sadmicrowave> only if someone can help me with this:
[07:30:34] <sadmicrowave> if I have multiple classes on a div (i.e.: "ui-close ui-icon ui-thickbox") how can I check if the class of the element contains "ui-thickbox"? for instance if( this.getAttribute('class') == 'ui-thickbox' )... does not work
[07:31:14] <sadmicrowave> b-lew, I'm not getting an auto-rotation
[07:31:41] <sadmicrowave> b-lew, it just loads the thumbnail photos and thats it
[07:32:36] <sadmicrowave> b-lew, I'm getting an error on your doctype line:
[07:32:37] <sadmicrowave> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
[07:32:45] <b-lew> huh
[07:32:46] <b-lew> thanks
[07:32:52] <b-lew> its auto goes for me
[07:32:54] <sadmicrowave> it just says 'syntax error'

[07:38:07] <b-lew> damn
[07:38:12] <sadmicrowave> Oggu,  $('select').find('option:nth-child(n)').prop('selected',true); ?
[07:38:20] <b-lew> okay i have a meeting i'll have to come page to this. I'm really sorry
[07:38:23] <Oggu> thanks

[07:42:30] <bot-t> rabbi1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:42:51] <rabbi1> i guess, jeditable.js .... brb
[07:45:08] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: thanks
[07:45:58] <delta1> hey all, quick question: trying to build jquery with the latest node.js failed with the following error, although it work fine when i checked out v0.2.0:
[07:46:04] <delta1> Checking jQuery against JSLint...
[07:46:05] <delta1> The "sys" module is now called "util". It should have a similar interface.
[07:46:05] <delta1> undefined

[07:46:06] <delta1> TypeError: Cannot read property 'reason' of null
[07:46:36] <delta1> i take it this is because node.js is still rather unstable?
[07:46:44] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: i got the edit option, but how can i save to server ?
[07:47:26] <delta1> I'm ok to use node0.2.0 to build jquery, what I'm trying to do is build a jquery version with just the ajax module.. please could anyone give me the basics of compiling individual modules?
[07:47:35] <context> why?
[07:48:16] <delta1> context: are you asking me or rabbi1? ;)
[07:48:30] <context> delta1: you. why on multiple counts
[07:49:48] <delta1> mostly for interest sake, I know it's relatively small to just include the whole thing. just wondering if it's possible since I already have a page using Sizzle and it feels like overkill to use 90kb of jquery (the site is for mobile too) when all I need is ajax for a json request
[07:49:54] <context> why node 0.2. why only ajax? why tear jquery apart as appose to just picking another ajax only micro-library?
[07:50:03] <delta1> is it more trouble than it's worth?
[07:50:19] <context> i dont know myself
[07:50:21] <delta1> ah sorry, had a look for some ajax micro libraries but couldn't find any.. any suggestions?
[07:50:41] <context> http://microjs.com/ is a good list of non-crap libraries
[07:50:44] <context> couple options there
[07:50:45] <delta1> and also re: node0.2 - because the latest node is failing to Lint jquery
[07:51:05] <delta1> that's pretty awesome, thanks very much context
[07:51:48] <sadmicrowave> ?ajax @ rabbi1
[07:51:48] <bot-t> rabbi1, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:53:08] <context> sadmicrowave: thats not what he asked.
[07:53:32] <sadmicrowave> context, he wants to know how to write the data from his dataTable edit box to the server...
[07:53:35] <sadmicrowave> you have another solution?
[07:53:47] <context> oh oops. sorry. thought you were talking to delta1 :x
[07:53:58] <sadmicrowave> :p
[07:54:15] <sadmicrowave> no, I don't know anything about node.js
[07:54:24] <context> but i should give you crap for saying that 'd***t*****' word anyway ;)
[07:54:42] <sadmicrowave> context, no, give rabbi1 crap for using it
[07:54:53] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: using what?
[07:55:09] <sadmicrowave> the d word
[07:55:12] <context> sadmicrowave: actually i get a sick sense of enjoyment watching people shoot themselves repeatedly
[07:55:13] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: anything else to use?
[07:55:22] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:55:34] <sadmicrowave> you're right, that is sick, but I too enjoy it
[07:55:53] <sadmicrowave> rabbi1, not that I know of, unless you want to make your own, which is what I would do
[07:56:35] <JackBauer24> sadmicrowave: I am the guy from that problem: http://pastebin.com/nXhgaWKE I did a research and it turns out that $(this).closest("selector") searches the parent elements, and the element I am looking for is in the same group as $(this)
[07:56:43] <JackBauer24> You got any other ideas maybe?
[07:56:57] <guy> once user selects file using input[type=file] is it possible to get file name using JS/jqueyr?
[07:56:57] <delta1> thanks for that link context, I'd seen it before but completely forgot about it :)
[07:57:08] <sadmicrowave> JackBauer24, do you know what the element name you are searching for?
[07:57:09] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: pretty new to JS, got less time, though i have complete gallery done in php... so. working on admin panel, to keep it more simple with ajax, but not much time to do it from scratch, anyways for my next version. i would do it by self. until then will use the shit....
[07:57:31] <sadmicrowave> rabbi1, fair enough
[07:57:34] <context> jackbauer24: .parent().find(..) ?
[07:57:40] <JackBauer24> sadmicrowave: no, I have no name nor id
[07:57:52] <sadmicrowave> JackBauer24, so how do you know what element you are looking for?
[07:58:01] <JackBauer24> context: I'll try that, I was trying .parent("selector") before but it didn't work. We'll see with this one
[07:58:06] <ShawnRisk> is there a way to create a youtube player like the old one where this was in an iframe with the video that is going to be played on the left and the other videos on the right?
[07:58:09] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:58:28] <context> actually
[07:58:37] <sadmicrowave> JackBauer24, 'selector' is actually supposed to be replaced with your selector...but since you don't know what your selector is, that will be hard
[07:58:37] <context> isnt there a siblings function
[07:58:46] <sadmicrowave> JackBauer24, so how do you know what element you are looking for?
[07:58:46] <context> oh, haha
[07:59:06] <context> jackbauer24: http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:59:48] <sadmicrowave> JackBauer24, is it the first-child, last-child, nth-child(n) ?...which element are you searching for?
[08:00:21] <JackBauer24> sadmicrowave: context's idea worked, both $(this) and element I was looking for where in the same div
[08:00:37] <JackBauer24> I just thought .parent('selector') is the same as parent().find('selector')
[08:00:45] <sadmicrowave> no
[08:00:49] <context> uhh so you do have a selector
[08:01:03] <context> jackbauer24: you can also do .siblings(selector)
[08:01:31] * sadmicrowave is banging head against desk
[08:01:51] <context> sadmicrowave: he did just say 'no id or name'
[08:01:56] <context> does not mean no selector
[08:02:25] <sadmicrowave> i know, but I asked 3 times how does he know which element he is looking for? with no answer
[08:02:45] <JackBauer24> sadmicrowave: I didn't notice, but I mentioned that in the provided code
[08:02:55] <context> sadmicrowave: yeah, he came for your help not the other way around :p
[08:03:07] <sadmicrowave> hah
[08:03:49] <sadmicrowave> fair enough - JackBauer24 glad its solved
[08:04:07] <JackBauer24> thanks for help :)
[08:04:21] <mbroadst> is anyone in here using the DataTables plugin?
[08:04:32] <sadmicrowave> rabbi1 is

[08:05:07] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: you want me to bang my head too ?
[08:05:14] <sadmicrowave> if you want

[08:06:04] <beasty> who's dutch here ?
[08:06:10] <context> you
[08:06:15] <beasty> indeed
[08:06:15] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:06:23] <beasty> actually no
[08:06:26] <beasty> i'm belgian :)
[08:06:40] <rabbi1> DJTrey: there are lot of JQuery Image gallery, that will do your trick with few changes... no more questions please ;)\
[08:06:57] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:07:11] <DJTrey> rabbi1: but none out of the box that does that?
[08:07:12] <sadmicrowave> rabbi1, way to help him out there
[08:07:19] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:07:52] <rabbi1> DJTrey: If you can pay sadmicrowave, he will do it better than the best
[08:07:59] <ShawnRisk> s there a way to create a youtube player like the old one where this was in an iframe with the video that is going to be played on the left and the other videos on the right?
[08:08:11] <sadmicrowave> I'll do anything for money
[08:08:14] <sadmicrowave> err - redacted
[08:08:42] <DJTrey> i'm about to pay someone $400 for doing this project for me, but I wanted to see if there was a plugin out there for it first
[08:09:12] <rabbi1> sadmicrowave: i deserv a thanks for creating you a biz
[08:09:24] <sadmicrowave> DJTrey, I'll do it for $500
[08:10:21] <DJTrey> ehh, already got quoted for $400
[08:10:25] <rabbi1> DJTrey: trust me, you get nothing out of the box, or else why should i bang my head to my balls. sick and tired of licking it
[08:10:31] <context> djtrey: just use a slideshow and tabs ?
[08:11:04] <sadmicrowave> rabbi1, thats graphic and unnecessary
[08:13:02] <jeffsmykil> is there an easy way to debug setTimeout?
[08:13:43] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, checking to make sure the event is firing when it is supposed to?
[08:13:58] <jeffsmykil> or if i have a bunch of setTimeouts running
[08:14:34] <sadmicrowave> no way that I know of unless you do console.log()'s or alerts
[08:14:58] <jeffsmykil> i think i might just be replicating them and i might have 10s of settimeouts running
[08:16:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:16:24] <tamarche> Hello all, I am having a problem with IE9 and trying to calling a .remove() or .empty() on ajQuery object that has 8 children of table trs
[08:17:00] <jeffsmykil> i gues i could watch fiddler to see if its making the ajax calls all crazy like
[08:17:08] <tamarche> I am running this in IE9 Compatibility Mode, and the call works fine in both Chrome and Firefox
[08:17:39] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, change the ajax calls to alerts or console.log()'s and watch to see if they are happening crazy like
[08:17:41] <aaronmcadam> am i right in thinking that instead of passing an anonymous function to call a function with multiple params, like this: function(){ do("x","y"); }, I can just do do.apply('x','y')?
[08:17:42] <tamarche> And with jQuery 1.6.4
[08:18:10] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave:  I think i have a bigger problem lol
[08:19:39] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, why would you want to?
[08:19:57] <sadmicrowave> when you can do the same thing without calling the .apply() function
[08:20:21] <ShawnRisk> seems no one is able to help me :(
[08:20:24] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, first off, yes you are right: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796788/whats-the-apply-jquery-function
[08:20:53] <sadmicrowave> aaronmcadam, but I still don't understand why you would want to
[08:20:54] <guy> is it possible to do something like this? $('#challenge div.submit-button').(file_name ? show : hide)(); depending on file_name to call either show or hide method.
[08:20:58] <tamarche> Update on my issue, it seems to remove successfully while in debug mode, but the changes do not get rendered right away in the browser window
[08:21:23] <sadmicrowave> guy no
[08:21:29] <jeffsmykil> tamarche: are you using Quriks mode by mistake?
[08:21:40] <sadmicrowave> guy, not like that anyway
[08:21:51] <dabear> <
[08:21:58] <guy> sadmicrowave: $(...)[file_name ? "show" : "hide"]()
[08:22:21] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: pretty sure that was an embed code directly from youtube.  Not at all related to jquery
[08:23:02] <tamarche> jeffsmykil: no, I dont believe I am
[08:23:20] <jeffsmykil> sadmicrowave: this whole clearTimeout business is screwing with my head
[08:23:34] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: yes but the custom player is no longer used which is what I want to use again.
[08:23:46] <sadmicrowave> guy, var $this = $('selector'); var $action = (file_name ? $this.show() : $this.hide() );
[08:24:13] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, lol
[08:24:22] <jeffsmykil> i dont get the whole ID portion of it
[08:24:31] <jeffsmykil> is setTimeout supposed to give me an ID?
[08:24:36] <jeffsmykil> or do I need to give it one?
[08:25:00] <ngharo> var t = setTimeout( ... ); clearTimeout(t);
[08:25:01] <guy> sadmicrowave: I already gave the solution.
[08:25:32] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, you can set setTimeout to a variable like this: var myTime = setTimeout(function(){...},500); then use clearTimeout like this: clearTimeout( myTime ) <-- I think
[08:25:50] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[08:25:50] <sadmicrowave> guy, ok, I didn't know if that would work or not
[08:25:59] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, is that what you are talking about?
[08:26:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[08:26:13] <jeffsmykil> just seems odd to me
[08:26:30] <jeffsmykil> should the timeout be global?
[08:26:39] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, it works the same with clearInterval( myInterval )
[08:27:04] <jeffsmykil> also ty ngharo
[08:27:51] <jeffsmykil> k see if this works
[08:27:54] <ngharo> aaronmcadam: function(){ do("x","y"); } != do.apply('x','y')
[08:28:12] <aaronmcadam> yeah i figured
[08:28:18] <aaronmcadam> is there a better way
[08:28:20] <ngharo> former returns the function, latter returns the result of the function
[08:28:26] <aaronmcadam> ah
[08:28:27] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, if you are clearing the timeout outside of the function it is created in then yes it should be global (I don't like global variables usually though).  Otherwise, if you call the clear function within your setTimeout init function then you can just pass the private variable through the function callback like so DoClearMyTimeout( myTime )
[08:28:49] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats what i figured
[08:28:50] <aaronmcadam> is that the only way to pass params to function
[08:29:03] <aaronmcadam> for a callback ngharo
[08:29:15] <ngharo> aaronmcadam: afaik
[08:29:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah I've been using that for ages
[08:29:31] <beasty> hmm any fast ways to create a ajax listener for events ?
[08:29:33] <aaronmcadam> just thought I'd give something else a go haha bt yeah
[08:29:39] <ngharo> yep because that's the right way :P
[08:29:55] <aaronmcadam> it just doesn't look very elegant :)
[08:30:13] <beasty> like when i do a $.ajax() and i got {0:'ok'} that he keeps repeating that till i get a '{1:'notification error'}'
[08:30:16] <beasty> for instance ?
[08:30:50] <aaronmcadam> I'm lookin at other people's code need to refactor
[08:31:38] <aaronmcadam> ngharo: can u think of a way to refactor this (not my own code) http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/DLERX/
[08:31:50] <aaronmcadam> maybe create an obj literal of the variables and loop over em
[08:36:47] <ngharo> aaronmcadam: you could do somethin like this: http://jsfiddle.net/DLERX/1/

[08:52:43] <mox601> I want to add autocomplete features to each field in the form
[08:52:53] <mox601> and i did this like this: https://gist.github.com/1313230
[08:53:28] <mox601> but the thing is i want to dynamically add more fields to the form when a user clicks a button
[08:53:48] <mox601> how can I modify that code to make it work?
[08:53:55] <mox601> with something like live() ?
[08:54:46] <kborchers> mox601: why not after you add the field, just call .autocomplete on it?
[08:54:56] <rroelofs> max601: +=
[08:55:12] <kborchers> also, if they all have the same options, you can just say $(".suggest_keys").autocomplete({...

[09:01:10] <felix_da_catz> So I am using selectable and have a list of images on the page.   I want people to be able to multi-select items on the page and as each item is selected a calculation is done and stored in a variable.  Any suggestions on where to start?
[09:01:18] <mox601> that could work, i'll refactor a bit my code

[09:11:45] <flochtililoch> hi folks
[09:15:04] <flochtililoch> i'm having a little weirdness using .data() function on jQuery 1.6.2
[09:17:12] <flochtililoch> the first time my page is loaded, i can read my data value from my tag just fine. At some point, i'm reloading the fragment that hold that data using .load() method, and right after that, .data() method on that particular tag will return 'undefined'
[09:19:19] <sadmicrowave> question, since IE6 does not support multiple classes in tags how is it that jquery-ui is successful in IE6? for example: if I want to use a 'X' framework icon I use class='ui-icon ui-icon-closethick' and IE6 styles this correctly....how is this possible?
[09:21:46] <hao> Hi there everyone :)
[09:21:54] <pifantastic> HI!
[09:22:29] <flochtililoch> well actually even when i update to 1.6.4 i still have the issue
[09:23:01] <hao> Can anyone help me with positioning UI dialog? Whenever i set position to (for example) [100,1500], the window appear in the bottom of viewport, like ~700px. It's just like the viewport limit cannot be breached...? :(
[09:24:18] <hao> $("#dialog").dialog({ position: [0,1500] }); - doesnt set window to y:1500.
[09:26:09] <JKarsrud> sadmicrowave: IE6 does support it on elements, just not in CSS selectors
[09:27:35] <JKarsrud> which means that jquery ui styles it like this; a.ui-icon-closetick {}, not a.ui-icon.ui-icon-closetick {} I guess
[09:43:55] <flochtililoch> alright i found my issue, although i don't understand it, maybe someone can help : considering i have a tag with the attribute
[09:43:55] <flochtililoch>  data-test='["foo", "bar"]'
[09:43:56] <flochtililoch> if i do the following :
[09:43:56] <flochtililoch>  var dataValue = jQuery('#test').data('test');
[09:43:56] <flochtililoch>  dataValue.splice(0,1);
[09:43:56] <flochtililoch> dataValue *and* jQuery('#test').data('test') will equals to ["bar"], when i would expect that *only* the variable dataValue would
[09:45:07] <rethus1> http://jsfiddle.net/2MZVZ/
[09:45:17] <flochtililoch> when i assign dataValue, why does that keep a reference to the original tag attribute?
[09:45:17] <rethus1> why this ajax request didn't work... is this a bug of jsfiddle?
[09:45:26] <rethus1> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[09:46:36] <flochtililoch> anyone?
[09:53:14] <mox601> can i do something like this in order to refer to a previously defined function?

[10:08:11] <gym_jane> thank you
[10:09:45] <dualcore> seems to work for me in chrome
[10:10:24] <Krambfhase> read the docs!
[10:10:25] <Krambfhase> The implementation also calls .preventDefault() on the event, so links will not be followed and buttons will not be clicked if .toggle() has been called on the element.
[10:10:59] <EdwardIII> hurrumph
[10:11:07] <gym_jane> which part of the doc?
[10:11:16] <Krambfhase> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[10:11:44] <gym_jane> can you please help?i am lost
[10:11:50] <karega|aniasis> when using animate and the complete callback
[10:11:50] <EdwardIII> i'm using this for a slide down nav, works fairly sexy, except when the mouse moves to the slid-out subnav, the 'mouseleave' event gets triggered which no es bueno: https://gist.github.com/1313527
[10:11:54] <EdwardIII> any pointers?
[10:11:58] <karega|aniasis> what variable can I pass to the callback?
[10:12:18] <EdwardIII> i can mockup an example to illustrate what i'm talking about if that sounded utter jibberish
[10:12:21] <karega|aniasis> animate( obj, function(i) {});
[10:13:02] <karega|aniasis> if I am animating multiple elements I want to know what element I completed animatin in the callback
[10:13:11] <Eviltwin> gym_jane: The problem seems to be the toggle eating your clicks
[10:13:22] <gym_jane> Eviltwin yes
[10:13:23] <karega|aniasis> event.target does not work
[10:13:25] <Eviltwin> If you add $('a').click(function(e){e.stopPropagation();})
[10:13:27] <Eviltwin> Then the links work
[10:13:38] <gym_jane> where should i add that?
[10:13:42] <Eviltwin> Anywhere
[10:13:48] <Eviltwin> Outside the .toggle()
[10:13:53] <Eviltwin> Before or after it
[10:13:58] <karega|aniasis> anyone?
[10:14:25] <fission6> i need some help with this fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/JYADk/ i want to use twitter's bootstrap modal to do a confirmation but i dont seem to quite get how to handle the button actions
[10:14:35] <Eviltwin> karega|aniasis: Use "this"
[10:14:36] <Krambfhase> EdwardIII: the usual trick here is to make the sub nav a children of the current nav element
[10:15:02] <johnernaut> I think I found a bug with jquery.  If I try and .load an entire page and replace 'html' on the current page, the 'body' tags are ommited from the page im loading
[10:15:39] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: why are you loading the entire html elemen?
[10:15:48] <Eviltwin> karega|aniasis: Or scroll down to "Step Function" on http://api.jquery.com/animate/ and see how they do it there
[10:15:50] <karega|aniasis> Eviltwin, yes I did, but didn't want to
[10:15:50] <johnernaut> don't ask.. moronic client
[10:16:14] <johnernaut> ryanneufeld: he wants the url to always remain the same, hence loading other pages into the current
[10:16:19] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to do a bunch of different animations for different elements, they should probably be different .animate's
[10:16:27] <EdwardIII> Krambfhase: don't suppose you have an example there?
[10:16:27] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: that's bad in so many ways
[10:16:32] <johnernaut> i know
[10:16:36] <johnernaut> lol i told him that
[10:16:52] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: just use $('body').load('url body');
[10:16:56] <gym_jane> eviltwin now the rest of them don't work properly
[10:17:14] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: youdon't need to load the entire html element to do what he's asking
[10:17:14] <johnernaut> ryanneufeld, I tried that, but I need the css references, js, etc from the other page
[10:17:18] <Eviltwin> gym_jane: What doesn't?

[10:17:47] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: well, your client is stupid, and how are people supposed to link back to specific pages?
[10:17:54] <Krambfhase> EdwardIII: no exactly but kinda: http://jsfiddle.net/AjTfj/ se how the submenu is child of Commercial property?
[10:17:58] <johnernaut> rofl, i know, and I'm not sure
[10:18:00] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: you will have to give links you want to navigate away a specific class
[10:18:01] <gym_jane> eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/AjTfj/4/ click on the second link and it doesn't toggle down
[10:18:06] <johnernaut> I'll try and talk him out of it some more I guess
[10:18:15] <jpcody> hey all, I'm running into an issue with .html(), html5 elements, and IE. I've got the html5shiv up and working on the page, and it renders fine. but when retrieving rendered HTML5 elements, IE borks them. anyone seen this behavior before?
[10:18:18] <johnernaut> the only other way to do it would be using iframes, which is terrid
[10:18:27] <gym_jane> zzaichik can you give me an example?
[10:18:32] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: tell him it's technically impossible, and will prevent him from showing up in google at all
[10:18:33] <gym_jane> also doesn't your name mean rabbit?
[10:18:40] <johnernaut> yeah
[10:18:48] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: why yes it does
[10:18:55] <fission6> damn, any ideas?
[10:18:57] <EdwardIII> Krambfhase: hrm not sure i get it - but i think my list is actually pretty similar?
[10:19:07] <dogarrhea2> how do you trigger an event continuously while your mouse is over a certain div
[10:19:28] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: http://jsfiddle.net/AjTfj/5/
[10:19:34] <Krambfhase> jpcody: try the 1.7 beta
[10:19:36] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: is he loading pages from another URL?
[10:20:00] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: I'm curious what his motivation is behind not wanting a url to change
[10:20:00] <Krambfhase> EdwardIII: mkay, please paste your HTML.
[10:20:13] <jpcody> Krambfhase - will do. do you say that out of, "this is a known issue" or out of "never hurts to see if the new version fixes it."
[10:20:17] <gym_jane> zzaichik now the other parents don't drop down
[10:20:28] <EdwardIII> Krambfhase: will do, i'll just do a mockup, 2 ticks
[10:20:39] <gym_jane> try try intellectual property for example
[10:20:42] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/AjTfj/7/
[10:20:58] <Krambfhase> jpcody: i know they fixed some problems with IE and HTML5 bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485
[10:21:00] <fission6> how would you block in a click handler?
[10:21:35] <EdwardIII> hrm
[10:21:38] * EdwardIII scratches head
[10:21:44] <Eviltwin> fission6: You shouldn't block in any handler
[10:21:46] <EdwardIII> in the mockup it works as i want
[10:21:59] <EdwardIII> ergo i must be breaking something heh
[10:22:10] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:22:51] <johnernaut> ryanneufeld: he has site.com and site.com/live.  He never wants /live or /anything to show because he doesn't want anyone to be able to visit those pages directly
[10:23:08] <fission6> Eviltwin: i am unsure how to resolve my issue, are you familar with twitter bootstrap?
[10:23:26] <EdwardIII> i'll go back to the drawing board and see what the differences are, thanks Krambfhase
[10:23:36] <Krambfhase> np
[10:23:41] <Eviltwin> Well I know what it is, I haven't used it much
[10:23:53] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: well, there are better ways to do that then what you're attempting. Like authentication, would be a start
[10:24:13] <johnernaut> authentication?
[10:24:32] <fission6> Eviltwin: i am trying to make a confirmation using their dialogue an its unclear how i would handle the button events
[10:24:45] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: if he doesn't want people going to /live
[10:24:47] <gym_jane> eviltwin in your example everything works perfectly but then the other menu items links i.e. sports sector don't work
[10:24:55] <fission6> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/JYADk/2/
[10:25:00] <johnernaut> ryanneufeld: basically, site.com has a timer that counts down to the live event. once it counts down the 'live' content should load in instead of them seeing /live so they can't go to /live when there's nothing playing
[10:25:02] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: it seems to be working for me..
[10:25:31] <gym_jane> which example or eviltwins?
[10:25:46] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: every link that you want to be active, needs to share a class name
[10:25:59] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: k, here's what I suggest then: use something like yepnope, or lab.js to load in the css/js you need, and .load() just the body content.
[10:26:25] <Ingshtrom> hey guys, how do I take a string containing HTML and parse it so that I can navigate it via DOM elements?
[10:26:43] <Ingshtrom> the only method they have is $.parseXML, but no $.parseHTML :(
[10:26:53] <johnernaut> ryanneufeld: k thanks
[10:27:04] <gym_jane> all sorted
[10:27:10] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: in reality though this should be better handled server side. Show the countdown, and change the URL when it's reaches 0. have the server check to see if the timer is zero when it loads, and then redirect to the main counter page if it's not
[10:27:11] <gym_jane> thank you rabbit :D and eveiltwin
[10:27:16] <Krambfhase> $("<you><html><here>")
[10:27:20] <ryanneufeld> Ingshtrom: html is xml
[10:27:27] <Zzaichik> gym_jane: you're welcome
[10:27:39] <andrew9183> is there an easy way to make jquery ui dialogs full screen ?
[10:27:46] <Ingshtrom> ok, well I did try the parseXML() function on the HTML string
[10:27:47] <andrew9183> or is it a hackaround with width and height properties ?
[10:27:55] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: so even if they navigate to the URL directly, the server redirects to the root
[10:28:12] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: it's a much safer way. Otherwise I could just hack the JS on the client side to make it show
[10:28:23] <EdwardIII> Krambfhase: this is what i mean - http://jsfiddle.net/JSBZR/
[10:28:35] <EdwardIII> Krambfhase: i want parent to stay blue, even when i mouseover child
[10:28:52] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: there are width and height options for dialogs, you could try 100% on both?
[10:28:56] <Eviltwin> fission6: You can .bind('hiddden',function(){...}) and the "..." will run when the dialog is closed
[10:29:09] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: you understand what I mean?
[10:29:48] <EdwardIII> this illustrates it without the annoying jittering: http://jsfiddle.net/JSBZR/2/
[10:29:53] <Krambfhase> lookin
[10:30:02] <ryanneufeld> is there a quick patch I can use to kill the event.layerX depricated messages?
[10:30:08] <Ingshtrom> Krambfhase: say I have a string:
[10:30:08] <andrew9183> ryanneufeld: the properties don't allow for percentages to be specified
[10:30:10] <EdwardIII> so it's actually a CSS shortfall which i need to make up with in JS
[10:30:11] <Ingshtrom> oops
[10:30:11] <andrew9183> only pixels
[10:30:24] <ryanneufeld> andrew9183: then i suppose hacking it is.
[10:31:12] <dogarrhea2> so to do continuous easing while my mouse is over a div, I basically have a while loop that checks if a variable has been set.  I set this variable when i mouse out or mouseover.  This sounds about right doesn't it?
[10:31:36] <Ingshtrom> Krambfhase: like var html = "<html><stuff>foo</stuff></html>" and do $(html).find("stuff").html(), I just get a blank instead of foo
[10:32:14] <Krambfhase> weird.
[10:32:38] <Ingshtrom> right? thats why I'm getting so confused about this
[10:34:01] <Krambfhase> you can try .filter() instead of .find() sometimes that helps
[10:34:10] <Ingshtrom> Ok. lemme try that
[10:34:47] <Eviltwin> Krambfhase: They mean different things
[10:35:10] <Krambfhase> Eviltwin: i know.
[10:35:38] <Eviltwin> .find() means search the tree under these elements looking for ones that match this selector and make a collection of them
[10:35:49] <Krambfhase> EdwardIII: your `position:absolute`is the problem
[10:35:53] <Eviltwin> .filter() means take this collection and only keep the ones that match the selector
[10:36:24] <Krambfhase> i know, no need to tell. Its just theat ppl often do it wrong when dealing with html strings
[10:37:21] <fission6> anyone want to assist me and trying to make a modal with buttons perform as a confirmatino http://dpaste.com/640921/?
[10:39:03] <fission6> i dont know how to tell what item was clicked
[10:39:11] <bear2ban> I added form validation to a smartwizard I'm using, but when I click the Previous button it too is validated.  What is the best way to avoid validating upon clicking Previous?  http://techlaboratory.net/products.php?product=smartwizard&action=2
[10:39:16] <Krambfhase> this
[10:39:52] <EdwardIII> hrm Krambfhase what should i be doing instead of position: absolute?
[10:39:57] <Ingshtrom> Krambfhase: so I did $(html).filter("html").text(); and $(html).filter("body").text().  neither returned me anything
[10:40:47] <EdwardIII> heh sorry Krambfhase you're a pretty popular kid
[10:40:53] <Ingshtrom> haha
[10:41:05] <Krambfhase> no, i just help too many ppl
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> $.ajax({
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> 										type: "POST",
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> 										url: "login_action.asp",
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> 										data: "team_id=" + team_id_input + "&team_funds=" + team_funds,
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> 										success: function(html) {
[10:41:09] <Ingshtrom> 											var stuff = $(html).filter("body").text();
[10:41:10] <Ingshtrom> 											alert("data: " + stuff);
[10:41:10] <Ingshtrom> 											stuff = $(html).filter("body").html();
[10:41:11] <Ingshtrom> 											alert("data: " + stuff);
[10:41:11] <Ingshtrom> 										}
[10:41:14] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[10:41:16] <Eviltwin> Don't do that ever again
[10:41:17] <Ingshtrom> sorry, that was an accident
[10:41:22] <Krambfhase> ./o\
[10:41:34] <Ingshtrom> I hate it when I paste stuff and it includes the newline
[10:41:49] <Eviltwin> $("<html><stuff>x</stuff></html>") yields [<stuff>x</stuff>] for me
[10:42:01] <CannedCorn> hey guys i created a page that has this fade-in/out effect when you scroll over posts on the blog and it works in firefox but in chrome when you scroll it doesn't detect the mouse moving until you move the mouse again
[10:42:08] <Eviltwin> So does $("<html><body><stuff>x</stuff></body></html>")
[10:42:13] <CannedCorn> is there a way to fix that sort of behavior
[10:42:33] <Eviltwin> CannedCorn: Also listen to mouseover/mouseout ?
[10:42:44] <fission6> ok i think i am close - if i have an input element type submit, how can i "submit" it
[10:42:44] <Ingshtrom> Eviltwin: are you using filter() or find()?
[10:42:57] <CannedCorn> is that how you do it Eviltwin ?
[10:43:05] <CannedCorn> probably a good idea
[10:43:22] <Krambfhase> hm, you'd better use .find() and maybe check that the server returns correct html ;)
[10:43:58] <Ingshtrom> yeah I checked the html using firebug... looks just like an regular html document
[10:44:47] <fission6> is there no way to do that?
[10:45:31] <Eviltwin> Ingshtrom: I'm not using either
[10:45:37] <Eviltwin> I'm using exactly what I showed
[10:45:57] <Ingshtrom> oooh...interesting
[10:46:13] <atrigent> hey guys... the jquery ui droppable documentation for the accept option is is confusing me
[10:46:14] <Eviltwin> It doesn't include html, body, and head tags when you do that
[10:46:22] <Eviltwin> It may even remove the script tags for execution
[10:46:25] <fission6> damn i am not getting any help here, i think i am not explaining myself well enough
[10:46:27] <Eviltwin> I don't remember if it leaves them in or not
[10:46:28] <atrigent> when it is set as a function, is the function called when the drop happens?
[10:46:39] <atrigent> or when the droppable is created, on every draggable on the page?
[10:46:47] <atrigent> because the latter is what the documentation seems to be saying
[10:46:49] <Ingshtrom> well thats my problem then if it is ignoring the html, head, and body tags
[10:46:52] <atrigent> while the former makes far more sense
[10:47:07] <atrigent> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#option-accept
[10:49:03] <fission6> http://dpaste.com/640926/ okay so this is my code, the only thing i dont know how to do is submit the "item" when "#block" is clicked, any ideas?
[10:49:14] <Krambfhase> the drop function is called as soon as an element is dropped
[10:49:23] <Krambfhase> hence the name
[10:49:36] <Ingshtrom> So what I am trying to do is request a new page.  The only problem is that I don't know how to pass on the javascript from the response as well as the body.  Basically what is happeneing is that my <head>...</head> is getting thrown away and only my body elemnt is being passed as the new page
[10:49:38] <atrigent> Krambfhase: I'm not asking about the drop function
[10:49:55] <Krambfhase> okay, which other function then?
[10:50:01] <atrigent> accept
[10:50:25] <Krambfhase> oh, yeah ofcourse, my bad
[10:50:47] <Ingshtrom> is it bad to put scripts in the body?  Conventionally that is
[10:51:11] <dogarrhea2> ok. so I can't do a while loop that detects if there's a mouse out
[10:51:18] <dogarrhea2> what's the way to do a hot spot ?
[10:51:22] <Eviltwin> Actually I think page load is sped up if you put all your scripts at the bottom of the body
[10:51:23] <dogarrhea2> and detect if the mouse is over..
[10:51:57] <Ingshtrom> I have never heard of that.  interesting. Thanks Eviltwin!
[10:52:13] <_zoggy_> 1.7rc1 is out. need to update topic
[10:52:35] <Krambfhase> atrigent: hm, yeah the docs sound kinda strange.
[10:52:47] <morphine> #my_table > tbody
[10:53:03] <morphine> I'm using this selector to try to clear out a certain table's tbody, via empty()
[10:53:10] <morphine> however, it seems to be clearing everything under <table>
[10:53:13] <morphine> what am I doing wrong?
[10:53:25] <Sandra> Anyone good with js and IE who can tell me what im doing wrong with the mouseevent on the first image of the three images (the one that says Lable 1, etc)? It works fine in chrome, but in IE 8 it just bounces around not displaying anything http://www.artofwallin.se/strateg .. im using pageX atm which I read on the jQuery website should work on all browsers
[10:53:50] <Sandra> And sorry for my crappy coding.. just started playing with js :)
[10:55:21] <pifantastic> morphine: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/9gZGc/
[10:55:51] <morphine> aye, I was just going to write that I found the problem, and that my code was actually correct
[10:55:55] <morphine> sorry for the trouble, and thanks :)
[10:58:48] <atrigent> Krambfhase: the code seems to suggest that it called when the event actually happens
[10:59:24] <Krambfhase> atrigent: in reality the accept function is called constantly. like on drop enter and drop leave or simething like that
[10:59:37] <atrigent> yeah
[10:59:38] <Krambfhase> http://jsfiddle.net/NnWgv/
[10:59:41] <Krambfhase> crazy
[11:01:22] <atrigent> oh yeah, in the code it is called on the "over" and "out" events also
[11:02:46] <fission6> how would i safely check if a varaible has an attribute
[11:06:37] <pifantastic> fission6: "As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set. "
[11:06:39] <Sandra> Has anyone done any mouseevents with IE8?
[11:09:28] <dogarrhea2> so settimeout and setinterval basically allow you to simulate multithreading?
[11:09:49] <dogarrhea2> if you do 2 setintervals to finish at the same time, what happens?
[11:11:00] <ajpiano> I N T E R V A L C E P T I O N
[11:11:19] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: One finishes before the other
[11:11:24] <rethus1> got this #submit has no method click-Message ... don't understand why:  http://pastebin.com/zuq7Vtqh
[11:11:39] <Eviltwin> Almost certainly the one that was set first
[11:14:50] <dogarrhea2> Eviltwin: do they execute simultaneously?  say one has a loop that does a while(true){add some text to the document} and the other one does the same thing but adds different text
[11:15:04] <dogarrhea2> i'm betting only 1 executes and then the other one executes after that
[11:15:04] <Eviltwin> No
[11:15:17] <dogarrhea2> which in this case, would cause a race condition for who executes first
[11:15:19] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is single threaded
[11:15:22] <Pessimism> If I have an element, <div id="foo>Lorem ipsum</div>, how would I retrieve "Lorem ipsum" from it?
[11:15:32] <Eviltwin> Pessimism: .text()
[11:15:43] <Pessimism> Great, thanks
[11:15:44] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").text()
[11:17:20] <dogarrhea2> i'm still not sure about this whole setinterval and cleartimeout though. if something is running in the background checking the time until a function executes, and you can interrupt it at any time with cleartimeout, that really suggest "multithreading"
[11:17:37] <Eviltwin> Nope
[11:17:42] <Eviltwin> Because nothing gets interrupted
[11:18:03] <dogarrhea2> there are 2 processes that i can see (logically speaking) .  A process that is timing something. and another one that is interrupting the timer process
[11:18:05] <Eviltwin> It will wait for anything else to complete
[11:18:45] <dogarrhea2> i see that it does that now, but the mindfuck is a little weird.  running a timer would seem like something owns that..
[11:18:45] <Eviltwin> Think of it more like while(waitForFirstJobToBeReady()){runFirstJob()}
[11:19:17] <dogarrhea2> that also would imply threading..
[11:19:22] <Eviltwin> Not at all
[11:19:26] <Eviltwin> How does that imply threading?
[11:19:37] <dogarrhea2> you're monitoring another process with what?
[11:19:56] <Eviltwin> I'm not monitoring anything
[11:20:19] <ryanneufeld> $.Deferred @Eviltwin
[11:20:24] <dogarrhea2> if you're waiting for something to finish that seems like that. it's probably just all semantics though. i should really get this thing working
[11:20:25] <ryanneufeld> ?$.Deferred @Eviltwin
[11:20:26] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[11:20:36] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Thank you......
[11:20:41] <Eviltwin> I've used them before
[11:21:12] <Eviltwin> while(true){doSomething()}
[11:21:19] <Eviltwin> Do you think that is threaded?
[11:21:33] <dogarrhea2> well i know that you can't interrupt that it'll execute forever
[11:21:43] <dogarrhea2> it's in a single thread for sure
[11:21:54] <Eviltwin> So why isn't while(waitForFirstJobToBeReady()){runFirstJob()} ?
[11:21:58] <EdwardIII> any thoughts on how i can keep 'parent' blue even when mousing over it's descendent? http://jsfiddle.net/JSBZR/2/
[11:22:14] <dogarrhea2> you sort of have to define what waitForFirstJobToBeReady() is actually doing
[11:22:43] <ProLoser|Work> some days i want to smack my coworkers
[11:22:59] <ProLoser|Work> "I don't document my code because I never had anyone else using it before"
[11:22:59] <dogarrhea2> ProLoser|Work: why don't you
[11:23:34] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: dogarrhea2 every time taht loop runs the function will execute, untill that function returns true
[11:23:47] <Eviltwin> No... while it returns true
[11:23:55] <ryanneufeld> yeah, sorry
[11:24:03] <ryanneufeld> sans caffine
[11:24:05] <dogarrhea2> ok
[11:24:07] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I know how to program, thank you
[11:24:16] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: don't be mad bor
[11:24:17] <ryanneufeld> *bro
[11:24:30] <Eviltwin> So I'm actually not talking JavaScript here, I'm trying to explain how it works internally
[11:25:14] <ryanneufeld> oic
[11:25:19] <ryanneufeld> scroll back ftw
[11:26:57] <fission6> any ieas why this form isnt submitting, http://dpaste.com/640941/
[11:27:36] <kvnn> can anyone recommend something like Chosen but for lists?
[11:28:24] <ajpiano> kvnn: why don't you just write a bit of code that processess your <ul> into a <select> and then call chosen on it?
[11:28:38] <kvnn> ajpiano : I can definitely do that
[11:28:45] <fission6> its like it wont submit the second time through submission, is there something to it?
[11:28:49] <Microtom> hello, I have two list of sortable items linked together. They work fine. However, I also have pictures that are draggable/droppable in the list, but they aren't a list themselves. When drag one of these picture into the list of sortable items, it bugs
[11:29:25] <Eviltwin> To whoever was asking about that menu: http://jsfiddle.net/JSBZR/3/
[11:30:06] <kvnn> ajpiano : its kind of funny to create a <select> just so chosen can make it a <div> or whatever
[11:30:22] <kvnn> I'd like a more straight forward solution I think
[11:30:58] <kvnn> but Chosen has some turnkey awesomeness
[11:31:10] <kvnn> maybe I can fork a chosen for lists branch
[11:31:32] <kvnn> eh i'll eat and think about this
[11:31:33] <kvnn> laters

[11:35:31] <EdwardIII> hey

[11:36:46] <Sandra> Its funny .. in some channels people go "omfg a girl!! i need to help her like omg!" .. and in other channels people just go "ha, a dude faking a chick name.. so lame.. gonna ignore that ass" .. :P Im just gonna seek help elsewhere :)
[11:37:02] <EdwardIII> bit defensive
[11:37:10] <EdwardIII> almost, almost slightly like a dude fakin ga chick name
[11:39:19] <fission6> oh m an come on, i cant even get a code review
[11:39:27] <fission6> no love today in here for fission6
[11:39:41] <koden> hey guys, I am trying to get the menu item to drop the background image of the menu item to the left of this page any help http://www.cppwpinellas.loc/making-health-easier
[11:40:44] <EdwardIII> fission6: where's your code?
[11:40:57] <Eviltwin> fission6: We review for cash
[11:42:27] <EdwardIII> will code html for food
[11:42:46] <fission6> i spent all morning trying to get twitter bootstrap to act as a confirmation dialogue and came up with this, http://dpaste.com/640944/  it sets an confirmed attribute
[11:43:56] <koden> http://www.cppwpinellas.loc/making-health-easier trying to get the divider to the left of the "current" tab to disappear... any suggestions?
[11:44:01] <EdwardIII> fission6: think you could put the whole source or a mockup of it in jsfiddle?
[11:48:04] <fission6> ah its kind of  hard to do that
[11:48:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Cvrff/
[11:48:27] <Eviltwin> fission6: That might be easier
[11:49:08] <koden> what am I doing wrong here?
[11:49:10] <koden> http://pastebin.com/k3x3j19N
[11:49:15] <koden> http://pastebin.com/i0EhT1s6
[11:53:04] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: you are pretty elite with jquery, right?
[11:54:04] <Aristata> Anyone have a super awesome graceful placeholders script?
[11:55:37] <pifantastic> ?g jquery placeholder
[11:55:38] <bot-t> pifantastic, jQuery.placeholder | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/input-placeholder
[11:56:37] <sean`> mts.be/placeholder @ pifantastic
[11:56:51] <sean`> mths.be/placeholder
[11:57:01] <sean`> and that would be Aristata
[11:58:13] <fission6> Eviltwin: i like that
[11:58:26] <fission6> so rather than do the whole attribute thing, just pass in a confirmed var to the handler
[12:00:50] <jedimind> Aristata, use placeholder attribute for inputs
[12:00:54] <jedimind> <input placeholder="">
[12:01:03] <jedimind> then use a bit of modernizr to do a fallback for IE
[12:01:05] <jedimind> and older browsers
[12:01:26] <jedimind> Aristata, http://uniquemethod.com/html5-placeholder-text-with-modernizr-and-jquery-fallback
[12:01:37] <jedimind> sumfin like that
[12:02:34] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: Sorta elite, yeah
[12:02:38] <Eviltwin> More elite with JavaScript
[12:02:49] <EdwardIII> JS is cool, eh?
[12:03:02] <EdwardIII> i'd like to get more into functional programming
[12:03:10] <EdwardIII> i use map in perl, that's about it heh
[12:03:15] <borillion> does someone mind taking a look at this with opera or safari ? http://www.startronics.co/magento/
[12:03:16] <jwm> I went from asm to javascript
[12:03:19] <jwm> as favorite languages
[12:03:21] <jwm> <-- crazy
[12:03:21] <jwm> hehe
[12:03:25] <jwm> I love asm too still
[12:03:30] <Eviltwin> Perl and JavaScript both have proper closure
[12:03:35] <Eviltwin> Which is not true of many languages
[12:04:03] <Trisox> could someone help me find a beter way to do this?
[12:04:05] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/3pBYj/
[12:05:32] <borillion> Im getting some strange jumping on the slider
[12:05:38] <koden> so I take it no one can help me in my quest for getting rid of the divider on the menu here http://testing.cppwpinellas.org/making-health-easier
[12:06:27] <ryanneufeld> koden: divider?
[12:06:27] <borillion> koden which divider?
[12:06:45] <koden> its the white divider between menu items, its a background image
[12:06:55] <koden> I need to get rid of the one on the left
[12:08:05] <ryanneufeld> koden
[12:08:11] <borillion> um left?
[12:08:25] <jedimind> koden, #css
[12:08:26] <borillion> I dont see one on the far left
[12:08:28] <jedimind> you're in the wrong channel
[12:08:45] <koden> http://b.4sm.biz/screenshots/clippings/66e9bd28cc25a536ed2ccca1d582964ffb629034.png
[12:08:47] <Eviltwin> #main-menu li a:first-child { ... }
[12:09:02] <ryanneufeld> koden: create a before-current calss
[12:09:07] <jedimind> Eviltwin, #main-menu li:first-child a { ... } :)
[12:09:15] <ryanneufeld> that sets the background on the a tag to not have one
[12:09:20] <ryanneufeld> then use .previous() to find it
[12:09:22] <ryanneufeld> and apply it
[12:09:25] <koden> ryanneufeld but how do I dynamically make that before current class?
[12:09:29] <ryanneufeld> make sure you remove it from any before
[12:09:31] <koden> I tried previous
[12:09:33] <ryanneufeld> you don't
[12:09:37] <koden> http://pastebin.com/k3x3j19N
[12:09:37] <ryanneufeld> you put it in your CSS
[12:09:40] <koden> and that failed
[12:09:43] <ryanneufeld> and do addClass and removeClass
[12:10:06] <borillion> so no one has any idea about http://www.startronics.co/magento/ the slider is wacked
[12:10:19] <borillion> its not calc width correctly in safari and opera
[12:11:57] <koden> ryanneufeld did you see my pastebin? I had that line but it isn't grabbing correctly... am I using it wrong?
[12:12:23] <phlp> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/3pBYj/2
[12:12:59] <Eviltwin> koden: Maybe something like $("#main-menu li a.current").parent().prev('li').find('a')?
[12:13:27] <koden> oh that might work
[12:13:31] <koden> let me give that a shot
[12:14:05] <koden> YES Thanks Eviltwin, worked perfectly
[12:14:07] <Trisox> who phlp
[12:14:17] <RedOrigin> what's a good way to resize content dynamically?
[12:14:26] <koden> and thank you ryanneufeld for your assistance
[12:16:05] <Trisox> phlp: nice idea
[12:16:40] <scatmandan> hi, does anyone have time to answer a few questions regarding node.js and chat/jquery bots used in a chat setting?

[12:18:48] <Trisox> mm
[12:27:58] <borillion> so all I know is that .panel is trying to jquery.cycle is autosetting to 1263, and the  container is only 1000px
[12:31:02] <dandrinkard> borillion: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html <- containerResize
[12:38:35] <borillion> dandrinkard, so its resizing?
[12:38:58] <dandrinkard> borillion does by default, would need a paste to know what's going on for sure
[12:39:53] <SkyFlyer> if I have 4 span elements with id='city'  and I want to replace all of them using the id... how do I do that?  I was trying $('#city').each().html('mycity');
[12:39:56] <SkyFlyer> ?
[12:40:03] <borillion> dandrinkard, www.startronics.co/magento/
[12:41:16] <dandrinkard> borillion sorry, not sure what i'm looking at?
[12:41:51] <borillion> dandrinkard, the slider on the main page :P
[12:41:58] <borillion> in opera or safari
[12:44:40] <dandrinkard> borillion is it not rendering correctly? looks like this for me: https://skitch.com/dndrnkrd/gdqbw/skitched-20111025-154427
[12:45:33] <b00l> Hi there! Does anyone know a script for custom radio and checkboxes that works with the newest version of jquery? This stopped work in the newest version.. https://pastee.org/53k85
[12:46:56] <borillion> dandrinkard, what browser are you using to look at it with?
[12:47:10] <dandrinkard> chrome/safari
[12:48:42] <Doumie> i have DIV -> inputs (one of them is checkbox), now if i check the checkbox i need to disable all other divs
[12:48:58] <Doumie> i'm trying to reach the inputs like $(this).parents(".div_class input").disable = true;
[12:49:05] <Doumie> but appearently i can't get to the inputs like this
[12:49:37] <borillion> dandrinkard,  http://s224.photobucket.com/albums/dd201/etechsv/?action=view&current=Screenshotat2011-10-25124745.png
[12:49:53] <borillion> dandrinkard, thats opera and ie8
[12:49:56] <borillion> LOL
[12:51:46] <dandrinkard> borillion doesn't strike me as a jquery problem, more likely css
[12:53:42] <borillion> thing is its calc a width greater than the width I have told it to use in CSS
[12:55:39] <borillion> dandrinkard, problem is in the slider somewhere the width set to 1000px and the slider is setting panel width to 1263px
[12:55:58] <borillion> as far as I can see
[12:56:46] <SkyFlyer> any of you guys have an idea on what this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/T4evQjYu   It's only replacing the first element in the DOM ?
[12:57:01] <Hopsy> hii sadmicrowave :)
[12:57:07] <dandrinkard> SkyFlyer IDs are inherently unique to a document
[12:57:15] <sadmicrowave> hi :/
[12:57:22] <Hopsy> I am your fan
[12:57:33] <sadmicrowave> glad to hear it
[12:57:33] <dandrinkard> use a classname instead
[12:59:05] <Hopsy> I read things about microwaves 1 hour ago, I have never known radiotherapy had microwaves
[12:59:22] <SkyFlyer> what's the link to that site that has the 4 panels with HTML, CSS, Javascript etc?
[12:59:24] <sadmicrowave> guys, I was under the impression that .remove() (and other such DOM manipulations) is expensive, at least more expensive than .detach() since .detach() doesn't actually physically remove it....my jsPerf says otherwise, any thoughts?: http://jsperf.com/remove-vs-detach-many
[12:59:27] <Hopsy> ?g radiotherapy microwave
[12:59:28] <bot-t> Hopsy, Microwave-induced hyperthermia and radiotherapy in human ... - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3681040
[13:00:33] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, why do you think I'm sad?
[13:00:56] <Hopsy> you have cancer? :(
[13:00:58] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy way to convert a json object into a string representation?
[13:00:58] <borillion> yea cause that sounds really safe
[13:01:00] <dandrinkard> borillion, any particular reason you're using xhtml 1 strict? FSR IE wants to render in ie7 mode, guessing a looser doctype might help (without reading all your code to see what's wrong)
[13:01:01] <sadmicrowave> oh god no
[13:01:12] <Doumie> how can i select parent element elements ?
[13:01:16] <Hopsy> then aids?
[13:01:25] <Doumie> like if this is a input in a div, i need to select other inputs
[13:01:33] <Doumie> or atleast loop thru them
[13:01:53] <sadmicrowave> ?sibling @ Doumie
[13:01:54] <bot-t> Doumie, .siblings() - Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[13:02:06] <Doumie> ah
[13:02:08] <Doumie> rgr that
[13:02:09] <Doumie> thanks
[13:02:28] <Hopsy> sadmicrowave: what do you prefer to use instead of remove?
[13:02:49] <bilel> hi, please how can i change the position of the dialo i would like that appear in the top of my page ?
[13:02:54] <Hopsy> btw, I am getting the same result
[13:02:55] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, well like I said, I was under the impression that .detach() was faster and less expensive...but that seems to be wrong
[13:03:04] <Hopsy> both are, 53,848 Â±1.55%fastest
[13:03:07] <jklmnop> is there any way to hook into the UI tabs after collapsing?
[13:03:18] <sadmicrowave> what browser?
[13:03:23] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, ^
[13:03:27] <Hopsy> Testing in Firefox 6.0.2 on Windows Server 2008 R2 / 7
[13:03:52] <sadmicrowave> ok, good to know
[13:04:17] <Hopsy> should I make a screendump?
[13:04:24] <sadmicrowave> on linux x86 FF3.6 I'm looking at 15,652 +-49.08%
[13:04:34] <jklmnop> i'm trying to find an event and tabsselect is triggered before i need it to happen, and tabsshow never gets called if you're collapsing
[13:04:48] <Hopsy> hmm
[13:05:18] <SkyFlyer> anyone on this quickly? http://jsfiddle.net/uGLMn/
[13:05:26] <sadmicrowave> jklmnop, tabs or accordion?
[13:05:30] <jklmnop> tabs
[13:05:36] <jklmnop> sadmicrowave: ^
[13:05:47] <sadmicrowave> wasn't aware that you could collapse tabs, let me look
[13:05:59] <b00l> Hi there! Does anyone know a script for custom radio and checkboxes that works with the newest version of jquery? This stopped work in the newest version.. https://pastee.org/53k85
[13:06:13] <dandrinkard> SkyFlyer: http://jsfiddle.net/uGLMn/1/
[13:06:18] <sadmicrowave> jklmnop, I don't see collapse as an event or a method....what are you talking about
[13:06:28] <jklmnop> it's not an event. it's an option
[13:06:37] <sadmicrowave> ok see it now
[13:06:55] <Hopsy> ow sadmicrowave I have 12 word documents open, one powerpoint, messenger, firefox with too much tabs. And I think that would also slow down the test
[13:07:24] <jklmnop> sadmicrowave: but i'm looking for a way to hook into that because i need to do something on collapse
[13:07:25] <SkyFlyer> my problem is that I can't do Class.  I have to use ID ?  I guess you can't loop ID's ?
[13:07:44] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, ok, I'm running on 8GB or ram also :) so that would speed up the test
[13:08:17] <Hopsy> so what makes you sad again?
[13:08:22] <Hopsy> :p
[13:08:24] <sadmicrowave> i forgot
[13:08:33] <defectiv> is there a way to listen to all events?
[13:08:35] <Doumie> http://pastebin.com/SumhKxng => this jQ doesn't work why?
[13:08:46] <Hopsy> defectiv: listen like?
[13:08:49] <dandrinkard> SkyFlyer you *literally* cannot have more than one item with the same id in a document. It's not valid and will never work.
[13:08:51] <Doumie> it runs... but it doesn't seem to change the css of the inputs
[13:09:02] <SkyFlyer> ok
[13:09:17] <Hopsy> defectiv:  use the .ear() function
[13:09:25] <Doumie> this => the checkbox in the div
[13:09:27] <defectiv> hah. neato.
[13:10:32] <sadmicrowave> jklmnop, I don't know the answer to that since there is not a predefined method/event for this trigger it sounds like you will need to figure out how it works.  Like, when you reselect it a class probably gets added to the tab div (something like: ui-tabs-collapsible).  Maybe if you create an event on that selector.click you could create the method you are attempting to use
[13:10:51] <defectiv> i mean to bind a function that catches any event.
[13:11:00] <PseudoNim> anybody know if it's possible in jqM to fire off an event when the user clicks on a collapsible layer to expand it?
[13:11:03] <sadmicrowave> $('.ui-tabs-collapsible').click(function(){...}); or something like that
[13:11:14] <PseudoNim> what the
[13:11:16] <PseudoNim> that was FAST
[13:11:18] <jklmnop> sadmicrowave yeah, i'm working on thatâ€¦ just wondering if anyone else had any better ideas
[13:11:20] <PseudoNim> thanks :D
[13:11:40] <sadmicrowave> PseudoNim, that was in response to jklmnop
[13:11:43] <Hopsy> defectiv: $(this).
[13:11:45] <sadmicrowave> but i guess it would work for you too
[13:11:52] <Hopsy> I dont know what you mean
[13:11:53] <PseudoNim> sadmicrowave: yea it should hehe. i'll try it
[13:11:54] <JAAulde> Is the autoResize property valid for UI dialog? I don't se it documented and want to make sure it's sticking around
[13:11:57] <defectiv> ?
[13:12:10] <defectiv> $('body').bind('click, or mouseover, or rails:form:complete")
[13:12:13] <defectiv> or whatever.
[13:12:15] <defectiv> anything.
[13:12:16] <bilel> hi, please how can i change the position of the dialog? i would like that appear in the top of my page ?
[13:12:38] <Hopsy> yes use this insteat of body
[13:12:45] <Doumie> http://pastebin.com/SumhKxng => why this jQ doesn't work
[13:12:53] <Laura_> Is there a way to use the live() function outside of jquery, using another framework or using native javascript?
[13:13:17] <Laura_> I am stuck with jquery 1.6.2 because of drupal 6
[13:13:44] <sadmicrowave> bilel, $('.dialog').dialog({autoOpen:true, top:0});
[13:13:44] <Laura_> I need a function using live and jquery1.6.2 running simultaneously on a single page.
[13:13:48] <borillion> dandrinkard, it doesn't make a difference infact it makes things worse
[13:14:01] <defectiv> Hopsy: what arguments would i pass to bind?
[13:14:12] <defectiv> just the function?
[13:14:17] <Hopsy> ?bind @ defectiv
[13:14:17] <bot-t> defectiv, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[13:14:33] <defectiv> i know what the page is.
[13:14:40] <defectiv> why would i be hear asking if it explained this?
[13:15:02] <sadmicrowave> defectiv, you'd be surprised how many people ask questions in here without reading the docs
[13:15:13] <defectiv> $(window).bind(function(){}) ?
[13:15:15] <defectiv> wtf.
[13:15:24] <defectiv> i want to bind on a particular element.
[13:15:35] <defectiv> e.g. the body
[13:15:42] <sadmicrowave> defectiv, what event do you want to bind?
[13:15:49] <defectiv> ANY FUCKING EVENT
[13:15:57] <sadmicrowave> settle down or you won't get help
[13:16:01] <Hopsy> indeed, do you know what javascript is?
[13:16:07] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:16:09] <defectiv> it's just exasperating repeating the question over and over again.
[13:16:13] <defectiv> oh that's rich.
[13:16:17] <JAAulde> ajpiano: Is the autoResize property valid for UI dialog? I don't se it documented and want to make sure it's sticking around
[13:16:24] <sadmicrowave> defectiv, here:  $('body').bind('click',function(){...});
[13:16:26] <sadmicrowave> no chill out
[13:16:28] <sadmicrowave> now*
[13:16:34] <defectiv> i don't want to catch just click events.
[13:16:40] <defectiv> i want to catch ANY event.
[13:16:49] <defectiv> am i on the twighlight zone right now?
[13:16:49] <Hopsy> ?click @ defectiv
[13:16:49] <bot-t> defectiv, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[13:16:51] <sadmicrowave> jquery doesn't work that way
[13:17:08] <defectiv> so you're saying you can't do that. well thanks. gee, a straight answer. great.
[13:17:36] <defectiv> i guess it just looks at the handlers available at element.data('events')
[13:17:48] <jlamoree> What would happen with $("body").delegate("*", "", function (event) {})?
[13:17:52] <Hopsy> defectiv: do you have facebook?
[13:18:31] <jlamoree> Or is that just super wrong?
[13:18:34] <sadmicrowave> defectiv, if you want to try something to test that you can do this: $('body').bind('click, mousemove, change',function(e){ console.log(e) }) just for starters.  If that pulls the events you are looking for then you have your answer
[13:19:02] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, lol
[13:19:24] <JAAulde> sadmicrowave: I don't think you use commas for multiple events
[13:19:36] <sadmicrowave> oh yea youre right
[13:19:49] <Hopsy> lol
[13:19:51] <sadmicrowave> ...bind('click mousemove change', function(e){....
[13:20:15] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, do YOU have facebook
[13:20:35] <Hopsy> well, I had
[13:20:38] <Hopsy> not any more
[13:20:51] <sadmicrowave> going 'off-the-grid' ?
[13:21:05] <sadmicrowave> smart move
[13:21:10] <borillion> sadmicrowave, if you dont mind and when you have a sec do you have any ideas?  http://s224.photobucket.com/albums/dd201/etechsv/?action=view&current=Screenshotat2011-10-25124745.png

[13:23:30] <Hopsy> ah, then you are a twitter guy?
[13:23:40] <defectiv> I do use the Twitter.
[13:23:40] <Hopsy> with pleasure hex``
[13:23:51] <Hopsy> Can I follow you :D
[13:24:00] <defectiv> I was using Diaspora for a while, after meeting the team at Pivotal Labs. But I stopped because I don't see it really going anywhere.
[13:24:13] <hex``> Hopsy thanks for that... when I get in trouble with something I call you
[13:24:15] <defectiv> sure, why not. @brokenladder
[13:24:26] <defectiv> pretty much all i tweet about is voting methods and politics. and veganism.
[13:24:39] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:24:44] <Hopsy> how do I know it's you?
[13:24:50] <Hopsy> can you post my name :(
[13:24:57] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[13:25:15] <defectiv> ll
[13:25:17] <defectiv> lol even
[13:25:50] <sadmicrowave> defectiv, the next question will be: can you deposit $1000 to an offshore account in my name?
[13:26:15] <phlp> borillion: overflow:hidden on the parent?
[13:26:25] <defectiv> totally.
[13:26:29] <defectiv> and the answer is no.
[13:26:48] <sadmicrowave> phlp, I got my IE6 absolute positioning problem solved :) by using clear:left;
[13:26:49] <Hopsy> I will help you to listen!
[13:27:28] <defectiv> go on.
[13:28:59] <phlp> gave up on ie6 long ago
[13:29:24] <JohnnyM> http://pastebin.com/L9vsCwAB <-- can someone help tell me why thats not working?
[13:29:28] <borillion> phlp, yes it is
[13:29:33] <Tobsn> is there a way to find out if a document/window is actually html or something else? lets say i have a user script and i inject javascript into all page requests - means it also tries to inject if the page is /image.png ...
[13:29:45] <borillion> sadmicrowave, www.startronics.co/magento/
[13:29:58] <sadmicrowave> phlp, I'd love to give up on it but corporate standard is IE6 :(
[13:29:58] <Tobsn> document.body will always exist because every browser creates a fake html page about any type of file
[13:30:03] <defectiv> why would it work?
[13:30:05] <borillion> sadmicrowave, test it in opera
[13:30:20] <sadmicrowave> borillion, I don't have opera nor do I intend to put opera on my computer
[13:30:23] <defectiv> Johnny how could you expect that to work? the argument is the event.
[13:30:24] <borillion> also wait about 30 seconds
[13:30:31] <defectiv> you're redefining $ as the event.
[13:30:31] <borillion> sadmicrowave, lol
[13:30:41] <JohnnyM> defectiv, well, im definitely trying to fix :)
[13:30:47] <JohnnyM> what should that look like?
[13:31:03] <borillion> sadmicrowave, maybe safari?
[13:31:07] <defectiv> well, remove the $ from between the ()
[13:31:35] <JohnnyM> oh that was easy ;)
[13:31:36] <JohnnyM> it wroks
[13:31:43] <defectiv> in the middle, just say $(this).val()
[13:32:00] <defectiv> and $(this).mask
[13:32:15] <phlp> borillion: thought it was a slider? it fades for me
[13:32:44] <RedOrigin> hey, how do I store php in a jquery accessible format?
[13:33:07] <sadmicrowave> RedOrigin, json_encode( $myArray )
[13:33:17] <sadmicrowave> RedOrigin, json_encode( $myArray, true )
[13:33:22] <borillion> phlp it doenst jump over to the side?
[13:33:46] <borillion> phlp  http://s224.photobucket.com/albums/dd201/etechsv/?action=view&current=Screenshotat2011-10-25124745.png
[13:34:03] <RedOrigin> sadmmicrowave: Thanks! I've never used json stuff before so I was looking in totally the wrong direction.
[13:34:06] <phlp> borillion: well i dont have opera either. i guess i was just expecting it to slide in from the side
[13:34:22] <sadmicrowave> RedOrigin, fo sho
[13:34:25] <borillion> phlp lol
[13:34:34] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:34:38] <RedOrigin> >.<
[13:35:10] <borillion> phlp it works but looks retarded there, funny thing is its doing the same on ie8 and ie9 if I dont sent the doctype to ie7 comapatible
[13:35:58] <RedOrigin> sadmicrowave: Thanks again I'm off to learn!
[13:37:35] <lancealtar> Hi everyone. I'm looking for information on a method used in jQuery UI's accordion widget. Specifically, in jquery.ui.accordion.js in the _create function `self._hoverable( self.headers )` is called. Would anyone be able to help me with more information about thid method and whether or not I can use this method in my own widget?
[13:38:57] <kininki> if i have a plugin / widget called myPlugin, how can I properly set up static methods that can be called without a selector like $.myPlugin.doSomething() or $.myPlugin("doSomething")?
[13:39:18] <ajpiano> kininki: were we talking about this yesterday?
[13:39:46] <phlp> borillion: well if its not sliding i would say remove the position css
[13:39:58] <JohnnyM> have to still do that
[13:40:29] <borillion> its sliding but when its sides its loading a 1256px size slide where it should not go over 1000px width
[13:40:44] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I remember that conversation as well...
[13:41:49] <kininki> ajpiano: yes but i'm still having some trouble. you said not to add to $.myPlugin and then i decided to just put all the static methods elsewhere and now i'm very lost
[13:42:13] <ajpiano> kininki: i had a half-typed suggestion that i forgot to press enter on
[13:42:24] <ajpiano> yesterday
[13:42:27] <ajpiano> i felt bad :/
[13:42:36] <kininki> it's the thought that counts!
[13:42:49] <ajpiano> kininki: i was gonna say, assuming that you have $.mynamespace.mywidget and then a bunch of static methods attached to that
[13:43:01] <scottm> When I set an html img element to have a css class in jQuery, it doesnt seem to take the properties of that class. Does anyone have any idea about how to fix that or about what may be causing it?
[13:43:08] <ajpiano> and you wanted an interface to call those things stringily and pass options
[13:44:27] <ajpiano> you could do $.myWidget = function( method, options ) {  var func = $.mynamespace.mywidget[ method ];  if ( $.isFunction( func ) ) {  func( options );  }    }
[13:45:15] <bilel> what means this instruction : "#dialog:ui-dialog" ).dialog( "destroy" ) ??
[13:45:41] <ajpiano> it destroys a dialog
[13:47:03] <phlp> borillion: if you wrap the slider in another div it works
[13:47:05] <kininki> ajpiano: and the reason for wrapping the namespace instead of just adding the static methods to $.myWidget directly is because then you don't have your code in two places?
[13:47:38] <borillion> phlp oh? Ill try that
[13:47:38] <ajpiano> i guess it's kind of six of one, half a dozen of the other
[13:48:18] <ajpiano> i just like the idea of static methods being on the prototype rather than just floating in space
[13:50:15] <phlp> borillion: actually i dont think it did fix it
[13:50:52] <borillion> phlp: Im just going to call it fixed if its ok in safari
[13:51:00] <borillion> I dunno why else its doing what it is
[13:52:04] <kininki> ajpiano: makes sense enough, thanks i'll play around with that
[13:52:12] <ajpiano> ok
[13:53:04] <kanzie> Im re-factoring my code into a MVC-pattern. Should I place all my event-listeners in the controller?
[13:53:24] <lancealtar> Would someone be able to give me more information about `self._hoverable( self.headers );` found on this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L45 ?
[13:54:15] <ajpiano> lancealtar: what information would you like about it
[13:54:29] <lancealtar> Looking for how to incorporate it into my own widget.
[13:54:42] <ajpiano> lancealtar: it's a method that's inherited from the base widget: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L348-358
[13:55:05] <ajpiano> so as long as you're using the widget factory, you can just call it in the same style inside of your _create func or whatnot
[13:55:32] <ajpiano> lancealtar: but it's only in 1.9
[13:55:38] <lancealtar> ajpiano that is what I assumed. Perhaps I'm just not using it correctly.
[13:55:52] <lancealtar> oh
[13:55:56] <LakWork> is there a method that will take a query string and turn it into an object? i.e. foo=bar&bar=foo becomes { Foo: 'bar', Bar: 'foo' } ?
[13:56:00] <lancealtar> ajpiano that might explain it. :-)
[13:56:04] <ajpiano> :)
[13:57:24] <lancealtar> ajpiano lesson learned. Look at the version.txt.
[13:57:31] <lancealtar> Thx! :-)
[13:57:40] <Whirl3d> will .removeClass take multiple classes?
[13:58:06] <LakWork> anyone know?
[13:58:52] <Whirl3d> Okay, nvm. I'll figure it out
[13:58:58] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: yes
[13:59:32] <Whirl3d> thanks ajpiano, I was just gonna try it out. You saved me a lot of time getting distracted for a test case. LOl
[13:59:34] <dandrinkard> LakWork: I usually use something like this: https://gist.github.com/0b4a86796027111c85af
[13:59:48] <LakWork> gracias
[14:00:28] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I have an ajax call within the sortable's receive callback
[14:00:41] <ryanneufeld> and I'm referencing the ui.item to do some work with it
[14:00:54] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to break out the ajax call but I'm not sure how to pass that ui reference
[14:01:12] <phlp> borillion: put text-align:left on #slider
[14:01:20] <ajpiano> "break out" ?
[14:01:30] <phlp> that's why you dont use text-align:center on body
[14:01:33] <ShaunR> what do you guys use for displaying errors from ajax.  I'm using jqueryUI for dialogs but i dotn really like the look of the dialog for a error, I'd rather have somthing that looked more like a error and not a dialog
[14:01:51] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I'm gonna pull an excerpt into jsfiddle
[14:02:05] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: function(e, ui) {  doAjax( ui );  }
[14:02:37] <ryanneufeld> ah yeah,  dug...
[14:02:40] <ryanneufeld> *duh
[14:02:55] <ryanneufeld> been doing some complicated isht lately
[14:03:04] <ryanneufeld> can't think of the simple solutions
[14:03:17] <ravenzz> mh
[14:03:42] <ravenzz> let's say that i clone an element and i store it on a variable
[14:04:14] <ravenzz> how can I work onto that variable (eg removing elements)
[14:04:27] <ravenzz> without effects on the 'real' dom
[14:04:28] <ravenzz> ?
[14:05:42] <Asone> $(question)? 'to be' : 'not to be';
[14:06:13] <phlp> ReferenceError: question is not defined

[14:07:38] <ravenzz> oh
[14:07:42] <ravenzz> damn
[14:07:47] <ravenzz> fixed ;)
[14:09:24] <js_node> hi
[14:09:58] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/qAXTH/1/ I've put a comment where I'm not sure if there is a better way to solve this problem
[14:10:48] <ajpiano>                     GET THE LAST ITEM ADDED ??
[14:10:50] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: this is in the context of a sortable, with a draggable connected to it. So the item being added in this case is a draggable
[14:11:16] <ajpiano> dude
[14:11:34] <ajpiano> oh wait, are you manually invoking albumReceive
[14:11:46] <ryanneufeld> no, that's the receive handler
[14:11:52] <ryanneufeld> on the sortable
[14:11:56] <ajpiano> then i don't know how it would work :/
[14:12:02] <ryanneufeld> the one I was just asking about breaking t out
[14:12:07] <ajpiano> first arg is the event, second arg is ui
[14:13:00] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/qAXTH/3/
[14:13:23] <ajpiano> ok
[14:13:26] <ryanneufeld> I have a (bad) habbit of just writing code till it works, and then separating out the functions when it's done
[14:13:49] <ryanneufeld> ignore the empty function at the top
[14:13:54] <ajpiano> yeah you  gotta stop that :p
[14:13:55] <aaronmcadam> i tend to refactor as I go
[14:14:10] <aaronmcadam> probably a bit too early heh but at least my code is organised and not working lol
[14:14:21] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah, i don't do it at work
[14:14:56] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: this is my personal project :p, still no excuse. Any how, what I'm doing is on the sort receive of a new item I have an ajax call to save that to the album.
[14:15:10] <ajpiano> heh it's ok :)
[14:15:41] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: if the image is already in the album the endpoint says false, otherwise, it's all good
[14:15:53] <SkyFlyer> quick question.  whats the best way to pull a div in with several child elements and then append that below the current one?  I need to change the child inner html?
[14:16:05] <ryanneufeld> once it happens, I need to make sure that it has the right data assigned to it for sorting later.
[14:16:29] <ajpiano> ohh so you want to conditionally finish the drop process based on an async thing?
[14:17:19] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:17:24] <ryanneufeld> exactly that
[14:17:27] <ajpiano> but you want to break out the ajaxy validation part so it doesn't live in there?
[14:17:34] <ryanneufeld> bingo
[14:17:35] <Hopsy> defectiv: did you solved it?
[14:17:36] <ajpiano> jsut that you can react to it
[14:17:39] <ajpiano> use deferreds dawg
[14:18:01] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah... That was a future upgrade I was looking at
[14:18:08] <aaronmcadam> hehe yeah
[14:18:13] <aaronmcadam> deferreds are so hawt
[14:18:29] <ryanneufeld> it's honestly that I haven't had time to play with them
[14:18:40] <Distilled> deferreds are the new monads
[14:18:52] <Distilled> or so i heard
[14:19:18] <ajpiano> function validateReceive(e, ui) {  return $.getJSON("..."); }   receive: function() { $.when( validateReceive ).done(fn).fail(fn);    }
[14:19:23] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: this is your time
[14:19:46] <ajpiano> fuu $.when( validateReceive() ).then()...  etc
[14:19:50] <ajpiano> read eric's article
[14:19:55] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: this is my time?
[14:20:04] <aaronmcadam> which one is that ajpiano ?
[14:20:05] <ajpiano> yeah, to play with dfds
[14:20:08] <ryanneufeld> oic
[14:20:16] <ajpiano> ?g deferreds in jquery erichynds
[14:20:17] <bot-t> ajpiano, Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5 | Eric Hynds - http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[14:20:24] <phlp> you can no longer defer deferreds ryanneufeld!
[14:20:27] <aaronmcadam> cheers
[14:20:53] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: it makes doing any breaking out/wrapping of service calls so much neater
[14:21:02] <ryanneufeld> sure seems so
[14:21:04] <ajpiano> cause you can have the serviceCall( options ) ;
[14:21:09] <ryanneufeld> thanks, also ajpiano am I doing the RightThing in how i"m 'getting the last item added
[14:21:18] <ajpiano> and then any func can call that, and attacah its own callbacks
[14:21:42] <ryanneufeld> the ui.item is the original, and not the one in the sortable, which is what I want
[14:22:23] <ajpiano> i'm not sure, point me to a line of code?
[14:22:35] <ryanneufeld> li = $(this) in the receive handler
[14:22:57] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle needs line numbers
[14:23:14] <ajpiano> seems half-deece
[14:23:24] <ajpiano> not crazy about initing the var as a string when it's gonna be a jquery later
[14:23:33] <ajpiano> that's kinda immaterial
[14:23:43] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: i'm really open to a better way
[14:23:50] <ajpiano> just do $(that)
[14:23:56] <ajpiano> and i donno, as long as we're just musing here
[14:24:07] <ajpiano> i've completely stopped doing like, that = this and other such nonsense
[14:24:14] <ajpiano> and using $.proxy or _.bind or native bind, etc
[14:24:52] <ryanneufeld> oic
[14:25:11] <ajpiano> also  you could just add the addClass("valid-drop") onto the chain immediatley before it
[14:25:19] <ryanneufeld> I was hoping there was some hidden feature of sortable that would tell me what the last item added was
[14:25:24] <phlp> ryanneufeld: in your receive callback your first line ends with a ; did you mean a ,
[14:25:27] <aaronmcadam> you're talking about Function.prototype.bind right
[14:25:39] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: yes
[14:25:42] <aaronmcadam> and underscore's bind/bindAll

[14:26:03] <ryanneufeld> phlp: nice catch, yes I did
[14:26:07] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[14:26:42] <jaequery> hola amigoes
[14:26:44] <jaequery> que pasa
[14:26:47] <jaequery> muy bien
[14:26:54] <aaronmcadam> excellente

[14:27:02] <jaequery> orale
[14:27:22] <aaronmcadam> #jquery-espanol
[14:27:23] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano, phlp now that I look again, that li= doesn't need to be there, I meant to take it out. I don't use it anywhere else
[14:28:26] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/qAXTH/4/
[14:28:41] <aaronmcadam> anyway, there's always something I've been curious about
[14:29:18] <aaronmcadam> when you set a function name as a callback, it gets the first param, such as $.ajax().done( success )
[14:29:29] <aaronmcadam> success will get data passed to it
[14:29:56] <ryanneufeld> aaronmcadam: yes
[14:30:13] <aaronmcadam> but if u want to add extra params, you have to type: ... done( function () { success( data, other, params ); } );
[14:30:39] <ryanneufeld> not if other, params are passed by done
[14:30:55] <ryanneufeld> if you're manufacturing those, then what you posted is the way to do it
[14:30:59] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking more generically, was just using done as an eg
[14:31:02] <jaequery> is jquery a form of a God object pattern?
[14:31:35] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: is God a form of a jQuery object pattern?
[14:31:36] <aaronmcadam> I've just always wondered, sometimes it looks a bit off
[14:31:36] <kanzie> Im using the module-pattern and jQuery. How should I construct my event-listeners placed in my modules constructors (and hence private). Do they need to call functions using full namespace to the public function or can I use an internal reference to the functions?
[14:32:24] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: in your return { method : internalMethodName }
[14:32:28] <kanzie> I guess what Im asking is if the event-function is executed inside the object and as such can access the private functions inside the module, or executed outside of the module and as such need to call the public function-names exposed by the module?
[14:32:33] <jaequery> ryan: if I believe hard enough, it just might be
[14:32:37] <aaronmcadam> you would call outside the module: module.method()
[14:32:42] <aaronmcadam> which would call internalMethod
[14:32:45] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: thanks
[14:32:49] <aaronmcadam> any help?
[14:33:44] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: so granted that I have my modules divided into MVC, would I place the event-listeners in the View calling functions public in the controller or place the event-listeners in the controllers?
[14:34:02] <aaronmcadam> exactly kanzie
[14:34:14] <aaronmcadam> the public funcs would be callbacks to the events in your view
[14:34:20] <aaronmcadam> that's how I use backbone.js
[14:35:05] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: well, not exactly, I set backbone's view methods to call my own framework's public methods, in case I want to change something for that specific view
[14:35:38] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: so a event bound to a button should be placed in the View-part of the module and calling a public function in my Controller pointing to a internal function in the controller?
[14:35:57] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: yup, your events should be bound in your view
[14:36:12] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: you got a good handle on it :)
[14:36:37] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: Im not sure about that :-) But Ill try and give a crack at that. Thanks for clarifying it for me
[14:36:42] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: are you rolling your own mvc?
[14:37:02] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: I strongly recommend backbone.js, at least read its docs, it will clarify the concepts
[14:37:24] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: I am! Im refactoring a large application that is a giant collection of functions calling each other. Building on top of a existing framework is preferred but might be to much of an effort at this time.
[14:38:06] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: you can adopt a similar approach to me. I'm writing a framework but using backbone for mvc to bind my events,etc
[14:38:49] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: interestingâ€¦ Ill look at backbone. It is actually in our plan to make this re-factoring this week and then in the beginning of next year transfer to backbone
[14:38:58] <kanzie> so getting closer to that structure is preferred
[14:39:15] <kanzie> but going all in on backbone will probably take more than the assigned week I have
[14:39:21] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: right, well backbone will let u concentrate on setting up that structure instead of worrying about the glue to hold it together
[14:39:24] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: ^^
[14:39:42] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: thanks for feedback!
[14:39:46] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: backbone is incredibly flexible, it's not an all or nothing thing
[14:39:58] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: you could easily test it out on one view to see how it goes
[14:40:19] <aaronmcadam> no probs kanzie

[14:53:41] <NLCJ|Home> Hello
[14:53:59] <NLCJ|Home> Can somebody help me with .delay?
[14:54:11] <NLCJ|Home> I'm trying to create a timer, but I cannot seem to get the delay.
[14:54:27] <skamikaze> ?delay
[14:54:28] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:54:34] <skamikaze> ;)
[14:54:51] <skamikaze> got a js fiddle for us dude?
[14:55:12] <NLCJ|Home> percent = 0;
[14:55:13] <NLCJ|Home> 	while(percent < 100) {
[14:55:13] <NLCJ|Home> 		percent = percent + 2.5;
[14:55:14] <NLCJ|Home> 		$("#progressbar2").delay(1000).width(percent + "%");
[14:55:14] <NLCJ|Home> 	}
[14:55:22] <NLCJ|Home> Hmm, shall I post it to pastbin?
[14:55:44] <NLCJ|Home> What I try to achieve is that it adds 2.5% width every second.
[14:56:13] <NLCJ|Home> http://pastebin.com/bbD0BhjX
[14:56:17] <NLCJ|Home> Here is the code.
[14:56:20] <dabear> NLCJ|Home: delay is only for animations
[14:56:34] <dabear> ?mdc settimeout @ NLCJ|Home
[14:56:36] <bot-t> NLCJ|Home, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[14:58:02] <NLCJ|Home> Thank you, I'll try it. :)
[14:58:33] <aaronmcadam> Quite a few people try delay() on arbitrary code
[15:06:55] <brl0> i have a page with some jsonp calls happening on a timer.. sometimes I get an error that the autogen'd jsonp callback function is not a function (in firefox)
[15:07:20] <brl0> is this related to the timeout issue with firefox and the callback still being called even though internal jquery is cleaning up the callback functions?
[15:08:01] <aaronmcadam> brl0: is that a known bug? filed?
[15:08:46] <brl0> not sure, that's why I'm here :D it's a guess at this point
[15:08:51] <brl0> the timeout doc for ajax calls states: In Firefox 3.0+ only, script and JSONP requests cannot be cancelled by a timeout; the script will run even if it arrives after the timeout period.
[15:09:06] <mbtez> can someone please explain to me why this isn't working: http://tinyurl.com/42q35sb
[15:09:08] <brl0> i'm not setting a timeout, but I suspect this is related..
[15:09:11] <mbtez> it doesn't get to the console.log
[15:09:12] <aaronmcadam> brl0: and what's ur use case? why u timing?
[15:09:15] <mbtez> but the request goes through with a 304
[15:09:23] <brl0> just intervals for new data
[15:09:31] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[15:09:33] <brl0> i think the webservice is failing to respond in time.
[15:09:38] <aaronmcadam> like a steam?
[15:09:46] <aaronmcadam> stream*
[15:09:51] <brl0> pretty much, yes
[15:09:59] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[15:10:11] <aaronmcadam> what happens if u make it a lot longer, say 5000?
[15:10:48] <brl0> my suspicion is the webservice isn't responding in time, and jquery is cleaning up the callbacks on some internal timer
[15:10:56] <aaronmcadam> mbtez: and how are u triggering that function?
[15:11:02] <brl0> i'll give it a shot and set a timeout for the call.
[15:11:12] <aaronmcadam> brl0: check the timeout on the ajax settings
[15:11:45] <aaronmcadam> brl0: u can use this to poke around the jq source: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/
[15:12:17] <mbtez>  through an onclick
[15:12:38] <aaronmcadam> mbtez post a jsfiddle with ur code
[15:12:45] <mbtez> there's way too much'
[15:12:51] <aaronmcadam> abstract it
[15:13:04] <aaronmcadam> i don't wanna see ur whole app ;)
[15:13:17] <aaronmcadam> are u preventing default on the click?
[15:14:07] <mbtez> no the link is #
[15:14:16] <mbtez> it's having problems with the jQuery.parseJSON i guess
[15:14:20] <mbtez> because the equation just stops there
[15:14:32] <aaronmcadam> u still need to prevent it
[15:14:38] <mbtez> why
[15:14:41] <aaronmcadam> even if it's hashlinked
[15:14:56] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't be hashlinking anyway
[15:15:00] <mbtez> yeah yeah
[15:15:03] <mbtez> :P
[15:15:17] <aaronmcadam> mbtez: yeah yeah, the browser's default action will be to jump to the top of the page
[15:15:21] <mbtez> oh yes
[15:15:31] <mbtez> well what should i be doing, the document ready click thing?
[15:15:34] <JohnnyM> is there a way to combine elements into like
[15:15:49] <JohnnyM> #('#blah #blah #blah').focus(function() {});
[15:15:56] <mbtez> yes JohnnyM
[15:15:57] <JohnnyM> #blah1 #blah2 #blah#
[15:15:59] <mbtez> i believe that's it exactly
[15:16:00] <gnarf> JohnnyM: comma?
[15:16:06] <JohnnyM> hrum... i just wasted a ton of time ;)
[15:16:09] <aaronmcadam> or give the els a class JohnnyM
[15:16:17] <gnarf> JohnnyM: css selectors... #id1,#id2
[15:16:28] <gnarf> ?comma selector
[15:16:31] <bot-t> gnarf, wrong value for selector property on chained finds with comma in ... - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10224
[15:16:37] <gnarf> ?multiple selector
[15:16:38] <bot-t> gnarf, Multiple Selector (“selector1, selector2, selectorN”) - Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[15:16:43] <briancray> combining elements needs comma
[15:16:45] <mbtez> there you go
[15:16:46] <aaronmcadam> i finding classing the elements works better
[15:16:51] <JohnnyM> so comma?
[15:16:58] <JohnnyM> yup that did it
[15:17:01] <briancray> selector space separated would imply ancestor relationship
[15:17:05] <aaronmcadam> i've seen code where there's like 6 or 7 ids in commas
[15:17:12] <JohnnyM> damn i wasted a lot of space
[15:17:15] <gnarf> JohnnyM: listen to aaronmcadam tho :)
[15:17:23] <briancray> that's fine actually
[15:17:24] <JohnnyM> ah ok
[15:17:35] <gnarf> 9/10 times, if you want to select 4 ids, it might be easier to just add a class to those 4 elements
[15:17:48] <briancray> also $(array_of_elements.join(','));
[15:17:50] <aaronmcadam> and qualify them with a base id if u need to
[15:18:01] <briancray> gnarf +1
[15:18:20] <gnarf> better performance from a single query for all members of a class than 4 queries for ids
[15:19:58] <aaronmcadam> and it's more maintainable with a class
[15:20:06] <aaronmcadam> than having to add more and more ids
[15:20:27] <aaronmcadam> hence the code I've seen where its $( '#bla,#bla2,#bla3... #bla9')
[15:21:07] <mbtez> can i not have integers as keys for a json object?
[15:21:26] <ShaunR> Anybody recommend a jquery plugin to do modals for things like loading dialogs while ajax requests are processing, login forms, question dialogs, etc?
[15:21:27] <aaronmcadam> and invariably, because each element is unique, u tend to end up wanting to do something unique on one of them, so u end up binding another event to the element
[15:21:31] <mbtez> this sucks
[15:21:48] <aaronmcadam> ?eval { 1 : 1 }

[15:24:14] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[15:24:19] <aaronmcadam> ah man lol
[15:26:10] <jtag> so guys when I use var file = document.getElementById('fileToUpload').files[0]; I can access file stats no problem but when I use var file = $('#fileToUpload').files[0]; it doesnt work, shouldnt that work?
[15:26:45] <ajpiano> jtag: no.  $("#fileToUpload")[0].files[0]
[15:26:52] <ajpiano> jQuery object is not a DOM element
[15:26:55] <aaronmcadam> dammit u beat me to it :D
[15:27:06] <jtag> ohh nice let me try this
[15:27:59] <jtag> perfect thanks :)
[15:29:29] <jtag> just starting with jquery, great stuff
[15:30:42] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ jtag
[15:30:43] <bot-t> jtag, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[15:30:48] <aaronmcadam> give that the once over jtag
[15:31:22] <danner> maconomy
[15:32:00] <FNTom> I came across a really nice autocomplete (it was linked here before) plugin where selecting an option would create a 'tag' of it in the search bar. Anybody know of it? I've search a lot but can't seem to find it.
[15:32:14] <jtag> I will thx, and food should be arriving in  a few mins, perfect timing :)
[15:32:53] <aaronmcadam> FNTom: is it Chosen?
[15:33:07] <skamikaze> FNTom: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[15:33:11] <aaronmcadam> haha nice one jtag
[15:33:31] <aaronmcadam> jtag: have u had much js experience?
[15:34:28] <coldhead> UR an inside job
[15:35:31] <NLCJ|Home> Thank you, it's working the delay.
[15:35:35] <NLCJ|Home> Time for bed. Cya. :)
[15:35:56] <coldhead> would that we were all so fortunate
[15:37:18] <FNTom> aaronmcadam: I think the one I came across was a bit more polished, can't be sure though - this looks good :)
[15:37:23] <aaronmcadam> speaking in tongues again coldhead
[15:37:40] <aaronmcadam> cool
[15:45:38] <coldhead> class war
[15:52:26] <chachan> guys, what's the best way to move a img tag to the last position at hover event on this example http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/qN7hC ?
[15:54:17] <aaronmcadam> chachan: move the img around based on a hover?
[15:58:28] <vacho> gentlemen, nikhgupta .... how do I copy something to memory that is created after the DOM is loaded.
[15:59:09] <aaronmcadam> chachan: do u mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/6zbHn/
[16:00:40] <aaronmcadam> vacho: set it to a variable
[16:00:50] <aaronmcadam> vacho: what do u want to "copy to memory"
[16:10:21] <Newtonianb> is anyone aware of a nice jquery system to organise comments that has functionality like search comment and search user etc..?
[16:12:03] <ajpiano> that's a very broad question
[16:12:34] <coldhead> Newtonianb: maybe use facebook> i believe that has a very good comment system and most people already have accounts
[16:14:03] <Newtonianb> colhead: thanks but its internal project
[16:21:06] <ryanneufeld> Newtonianb: disqus
[16:23:05] <ciss> hi, i'm having a little trouble with .serialize() and submit buttons. the name/value pair of the clicked button doesnt get serialized, even though it should be a "successful control": http://jsfiddle.net/HGmxX/1/
[16:26:40] <coldhead> i don't think it is a successful control
[16:27:14] <coldhead> serialize() is not aware of its being used
[16:27:44] <coldhead> it's just like "ooh a form, let me serialize that for you, i'll just ignore this pesky submit buttom"
[16:28:00] <coldhead> it's documented a lot if you ask google
[16:28:25] <ciss> according to http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2 it should be considered successful
[16:31:21] <coldhead> but according to jQuery it isn't
[16:31:25] <coldhead> "Note: Only "successful controls" are serialized to the string. No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button."
[16:32:08] <coldhead> i defer to the superior spec reading powers of the implementers of serialize()
[16:32:18] <ciss> yep, it's kind of a quirky interpretation, the real reason being http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/f82bccd7bebdc838
[16:32:38] <ciss> they decided to not fix it and leave it to plugins: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3523
[16:34:20] <johnywp> hey all
[16:34:23] <coldhead> better minds than mine!
[16:34:52] <johnywp> if i use an event trigger to .load('/example.php');
[16:34:53] <coldhead> ciss: you can just change the input from a submit to a hidden type before you serialize, no?
[16:35:08] <johnywp> would it be the same as if i was using the include php function?
[16:35:43] <ciss> coldhead: interesting thought, i'll give it a try
[16:36:35] <coldhead> johnywp: kinda?
[16:36:54] <coldhead> the main difference being that it isn't happening in the client with include()
[16:37:05] <coldhead> but i assume you mean something more philosophical
[16:37:20] <abjorn> coldhead
[16:37:21] <abjorn> mah niga
[16:37:31] <coldhead> by god that's offensive
[16:37:36] <coldhead> hi abjorn
[16:39:37] <coldhead> nice delegating, btw, ciss
[16:39:40] <johnywp> coldhead lol
[16:39:45] <johnywp> kindof
[16:39:49] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I find your use of the word 'god' offensive
[16:39:50] <johnywp> but not really
[16:39:57] <johnywp> i mean very practical actually
[16:39:59] <coldhead> ciss: you briefed on on/off in jQuery css?
[16:40:11] <coldhead> jquery 1.7*
[16:40:26] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, dyamic  abbreviation
[16:40:45] <coldhead> god told me to use that word, ryanneufeld
[16:40:52] <coldhead> PROVE HE DIDN'T
[16:40:56] <ryanneufeld> who's god? yours?
[16:41:00] <ryanneufeld> Prove he did!
[16:41:13] <abjorn> sup coldhead
[16:41:17] <ciss> coldhead: not that i remember
[16:41:25] <coldhead> i'l do you a jsfiddle, ryanneufeld
[16:41:43] <coldhead> ciss: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[16:41:44] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I'm on the edge of my seat :)
[16:41:52] <johnywp> basically
[16:42:01] <johnywp> i have a page with a form
[16:42:06] <johnywp> when the user submits the form
[16:42:16] <johnywp> some info is displayed
[16:42:28] <johnywp> i have the whole php code that displays the code in a php file?
[16:42:42] <johnywp> which i used to "include"
[16:43:10] <ciss> coldhead: so they're opening the next argument hell ... :)
[16:43:13] <WillMarshall> Are there any good tools for using CSS3 animations with JQuery-style callbacks etc?
[16:43:13] <johnywp> now, I want to make the page load, and then I have a button that when click it .load(example.php) and displays it
[16:43:21] <johnywp> would that work?
[16:43:25] <WillMarshall> I've been looking at raw CSS3 animations, but they're unwieldly
[16:43:43] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: yup, that's how you'd do it
[16:43:45] <coldhead> ciss: "i used to love jQuery but this simplification of 3 different forms of event handling confuses and infuriates me!"
[16:44:23] <ciss> coldhead: not exactly
[16:44:37] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: is your form dynamically generated? or do you just not want it there when the page loads?
[16:44:39] <coldhead> johnywp: a nice thing about load is you can do $('whatever').load('some_url #someselector') and it will extract JUST that selector for you
[16:44:43] <johnywp> ryanneufeld: for some reason, when I load it - it doesn't get loaded :S
[16:44:45] <vacho> aaron
[16:44:52] <ciss> coldhead: ok, agreed, it's cool. satisfied?
[16:45:07] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: why not just include it in the html, with display:none, and then show it
[16:45:15] <johnywp> interesting
[16:45:21] <ryanneufeld> then the user doesn't have a delay waiting for code to load
[16:45:24] <johnywp> the problem is that the file basically queries an api
[16:45:32] <coldhead> ciss: hahaha i am not even smart enough to use delegate, i just pointed out the up&coming in case you wanted to use it
[16:45:32] <johnywp> and it takes too long to load
[16:45:51] <johnywp> and while waiting for it to load, the page shows as incomplete
[16:45:56] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[16:46:15] <johnywp> as in... half the page loads, it waits for the output of the api query, and then the rest of the page loads.
[16:46:22] <ciss> coldhead: please don't insult me :)
[16:46:27] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: where's that jsfiddle you promised me?
[16:46:58] <coldhead> aw i'm not insulting anyone except gypsies and hoarders
[16:47:02] <coldhead> those guys are hilarious
[16:47:03] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: then do this $('#idoftheelementyouwantitin').load('url/to/form.php);
[16:47:16] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: this might take a while
[16:47:21] <johnywp> here is the thing
[16:47:28] <johnywp> the php file starts with <?php if ($_POST['location_text'] != "") {
[16:47:31] <ciss> ryanneufeld: be patient, it's his first day
[16:47:32] <coldhead> i just have to reread descartes first
[16:47:52] <coldhead> in french
[16:47:55] <johnywp> and for some reason, it doesn't seem to get the $_post values when I .load it
[16:47:59] <coldhead> it's my first day learning french
[16:48:01] <coldhead> tres bien
[16:48:09] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: cause .load doesn't do a post, it does a get
[16:48:16] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: use .ajax instead
[16:48:17] <johnywp> and i know that it's being loaded cause I put some random text before the if statement which is getting displayed
[16:48:20] <johnywp> ohhh ok
[16:48:27] <coldhead> ?ajax @ johnywp
[16:48:27] <bot-t> johnywp, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:48:29] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: .load is just a convenience method
[16:48:31] <johnywp> would it just be .ajax instead of .load?
[16:48:35] <ryanneufeld> very good coldhead
[16:48:38] <coldhead> or for a different convenience
[16:48:41] <ryanneufeld> not bad for your first day
[16:48:41] <coldhead> ?post @ johnywp
[16:48:42] <bot-t> johnywp, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:48:57] <coldhead> see how that sounds like exactly what you want? :D
[16:49:09] <ryanneufeld> maybe cause it is
[16:49:12] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[16:49:50] <johnywp> a simple .ajax doesn't seem to work :P but it probably needs more arguments :P
[16:50:33] <ryanneufeld> simple ajax will default to GET
[16:50:51] <johnywp> oh
[16:51:08] <ryanneufeld> look at the time! It's bunk-o-clock!
[16:52:16] <coldhead> goodnight ryry
[16:52:56] <ryanneufeld> since when are we calling me ryry?
[16:53:09] <johnywp> .ajax({ url: "example.php", type: "POST" }); looks about right?
[16:53:11] <coldhead> since that night?
[16:53:16] <coldhead> that unforgettable night?
[16:53:23] <coldhead> oh wait that must have been the other ryan
[16:53:35] <coldhead> sorry ryry
[16:53:53] <coldhead> johnywp: you probably want to send some actual POST data
[16:54:00] <johnywp> hmm
[16:54:33] <ryanneufeld> DAMN YOU ryanseddon
[16:54:46] <coldhead> guh i am ALWAYS too slow
[16:55:24] <ryanseddon> ?
[16:56:11] <johnywp> any documentation on how to do that coldhead?
[16:56:34] <coldhead> ?ajax @ johnywp
[16:56:34] <bot-t> johnywp, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:56:48] <coldhead> it should be as simple as adding to what you already have in the {}
[16:57:03] <coldhead> data: {foo: 'lol', pants: false}
[16:57:38] <coldhead> don't worry about it, other ryry, it's chinatown
[16:57:49] <johnywp> hmm oki trying it :D
[16:57:57] <ciss> coldhead: anyway, changing the type is not permitted, but duplicating name and value to a hidden field works: http://jsfiddle.net/HGmxX/3/
[16:58:00] <ciss> thanks for the hint
[16:58:23] <coldhead> changing the type is prohibited? gross!

[17:09:59] <mohi666> Is there any ways in jQuery to keep a connection open to server and fetch live data from server?
[17:11:31] <mohi666> I have a function that takes around 30 seconds to run multiple steps. I want to notify users when every step is done.
[17:11:48] <mohi666> any idea what materials I need to go through?
[17:12:36] <johnywp> when using data: { I should not use $ for variables?
[17:12:51] <johnywp> ie. $foo = ... becomes foo = ...?
[17:13:11] <ciss> mohi666: afaik you have to do multiple requests to fetch the current processing state
[17:13:37] <coldhead> the $ in POST variables is PHP's business
[17:13:58] <mohi666> ciss: you mean I should keep sending ajax requests to server?
[17:14:00] <coldhead> if you say data: {foo: 'aids'} that should become $_POST['foo'] on the PHP side
[17:14:13] <johnywp> hmm
[17:14:18] <johnywp> in the php file that I am loading
[17:14:21] <ciss> mohi666: yes. you can delay the response on the server, the connection will stay open in the meantime
[17:14:31] <johnywp> i have $zip = $_POST['location_text'] ;
[17:14:39] <johnywp> how would i pass this through the data:
[17:14:53] <johnywp> zip = location_text
[17:15:03] <coldhead> data: {location_text: 'some stuff'}
[17:15:10] <coldhead> or
[17:15:18] <coldhead> data: {location_text: someVariable}
[17:15:24] <johnywp> hmm
[17:15:32] <ajpiano> or even data: {location_text: $someVariable}
[17:15:40] <johnywp> as in  data: {location_text: $zip} ?
[17:15:47] <ajpiano> johnywp: you don't have to name your variables anything special to send them over post
[17:15:50] <Zxurian> if ajax request 1 comes first, and takes 3 seconds, and ajax request 2 comes after, and only tkes 0.5 seconds, then request 2 shouldn't wait for request 1 to complete, correct?
[17:15:52] <ajpiano> johnywp: see ?$prefix
[17:15:53] <bot-t> johnywp, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[17:16:00] <mohi666> ciss: That way, I will need a loop on the server to execute a function until it returns a value?
[17:16:04] <coldhead> or even data: {location_text: $_POST['someVariable']}
[17:16:11] <johnywp> ahh ok
[17:16:40] <coldhead> i love bot-t's secret hatred for hungarians
[17:16:56] <ajpiano> johnywp: and it defintely doesn't make sense to use $var for *strings* in javascript...
[17:17:00] <coldhead> bot-t so invades poland
[17:17:07] <ajpiano> unless you like, like php and want $ infront of every single var
[17:17:16] <coldhead> $trings
[17:17:25] <coldhead> it's $emantic
[17:17:40] <mohi666> ciss: do you know how Google finance updates stocks price live?
[17:17:46] <coldhead> especially if it's a post() that is going to turn into profit
[17:17:51] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[17:18:03] <coldhead> HI NICOLAS_LEONIDA2
[17:18:03] <Nicolas_Leonida2> is there a way to know if $(this) has class ClassName ?
[17:18:03] <bot-t> coldhead, Photoshop és más leírások # tutorial.hu - http://www.tutorial.hu/
[17:18:19] <bot-t> coldhead, Ã‰n nem utÃ¡lom a magyarok
[17:18:24] <coldhead> $(this).is('.classname')
[17:18:35] <ajpiano> or hasClass("classname") lolz
[17:18:54] <coldhead> i assume that is "faster"
[17:19:03] <ciss> mohi666: no, but you can keep firebug's network tab or chrome's resources tab open to monitor what is being sent and received
[17:19:04] <BinaryKitten> hasClass = better but coldhead has only been using jquery for a day
[17:19:43] <coldhead> i think you mean ==, BK
[17:20:20] <coldhead> here are some jQuery things i have never used: hasClass, delegate, deferreds, queues
[17:20:24] <brettfrable> anyone in here know a good php room
[17:20:31] <coldhead> oh good grief
[17:20:47] <brettfrable> im having some trouble connecting to a remote database from my local server
[17:21:36] <ciss> that's unfortunate
[17:22:13] <ciss> brettfrable: try #php
[17:27:44] <johnywp> i have data: {zip: $_POST['location_text'], type = $_POST['map_tax']}
[17:28:19] <johnywp> does that mean that send the following to the php file? $zip = $_POST['location_text'] AND $type = $_POST['map_tax'] ??
[17:29:11] <Deadpool21619> hi
[17:29:29] <Deadpool21619> quick autocomplete question anyone here willing to help
[17:30:23] <bot-t> Deadpool21619, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:30:42] <coldhead> sorry johnywp, i was being an idiot, you can't use $_POST in your JS
[17:30:51] <johnywp> :P
[17:30:52] <coldhead> it's my first day
[17:30:59] <johnywp> lol
[17:31:15] <johnywp> i wish i knew as much as you know on your first day :P
[17:31:21] <Deadpool21619> is there an easy way to store searches like in a database so next time it will populate
[17:31:37] <johnywp> is there any way to pass $_post variables through js?
[17:31:37] <coldhead> johnywp: you want type:whatever not type = whatever
[17:32:04] <johnywp> i basically want to pass variables that will take the values of the inputs
[17:32:24] <Deadpool21619> hey me too Johnywp
[17:32:26] <Deadpool21619> nm
[17:32:28] <coldhead> johnywp: you can go <input id="something" value="<?= $something ?>" />
[17:32:38] <Deadpool21619> thanks Johnywp
[17:32:39] <coldhead> and then $('#something').val()
[17:32:51] <coldhead> that's slightly terrible
[17:33:20] <johnywp> hmm
[17:33:26] <johnywp> not sure I am following :P
[17:33:42] <johnywp> is there maybe any other way to do this - not as complicated?
[17:33:59] <johnywp> i basically don't want the page to break while waiting for the output of the api request
[17:34:13] <johnywp> i wouldn't mind having a loading animation playing while loading or anything of that sort
[17:35:52] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: i only caught from "is ther maybe another way.." but maybe i can help
[17:36:07] <Dave_Stein> can you copy paste what you were askin
[17:37:22] <johnywp> of course
[17:39:53] <MaC> can someone help me. I need to figure out how to read the width of an image and if it's a certain width add margin to it
[17:40:30] <johnywp> basically
[17:40:35] <johnywp> here is what i am trying to do
[17:40:39] <Dave_Stein> ?width @ MaC
[17:40:40] <bot-t> MaC, .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[17:40:44] <Dave_Stein> ?outerWidth @ MaC
[17:40:46] <bot-t> MaC, .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[17:40:50] <MaC> i used css(width)
[17:40:55] <MaC> jQuery(".galleria-image-inline").css(width);
[17:41:02] <johnywp>  i have a page with a form
[17:41:05] <MaC> I'm totally unfamiliar with how to assign this to a variable
[17:41:06] <johnywp> when the user submits the form
[17:41:09] <johnywp> some info is displayed
[17:41:14] <johnywp> i have the whole php code that displays the code in a php file?
[17:41:17] <johnywp> which i used to "include"
[17:41:22] <johnywp> now, I want to make the page load, and then I have a button that when click it .load(example.php) and displays it
[17:41:37] <MaC> also I need it to work for every element that matches
[17:41:44] <MaC> ;\
[17:41:56] <johnywp> i was told that .load doesn't post variables - so coldhead recommended that I use .ajax
[17:42:05] <Dave_Stein> ?each @ MaC :)
[17:42:09] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, .keydown() - Bind an event handler to the "keydown" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[17:42:10] <johnywp> the problem is that the .php file that I am loading starts with:
[17:42:14] <Dave_Stein> err
[17:42:17] <Dave_Stein> ?each @ MaC
[17:42:18] <bot-t> MaC, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[17:42:27] <Dave_Stein> if you don't know how to save a var, you need to read more about JS
[17:42:30] <johnywp> <?php if ($_POST['location_text'] != "") { where location_text is the name of one of the inputs
[17:42:48] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: that sounds about right, what coldhead said
[17:43:00] <johnywp> and then proceeds to settings variables for the post inputs such as $zip = $_POST['location_text'] ;
[17:43:17] <johnywp> so, then I was trying to get .ajax to work
[17:43:29] <Dave_Stein> MaC: you can use each on your collection of galleria images and then save off stuff thataway
[17:43:49] <MaC> thanks  everybody
[17:43:51] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: so you awnt the user to see some kinda loading thing goin on while the ajax call is goin?
[17:44:02] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: you around guy?
[17:44:09] <ajpiano> sup
[17:44:24] <Dave_Stein> man that was fast
[17:44:30] <ajpiano> i'm workin but here
[17:44:47] <Dave_Stein> so can you help me out with that github stuff? it's ironic me following the github help to avoid asking you/corey/scott has screwed me
[17:45:29] <ajpiano> do you want me to just fix it :x
[17:45:32] <Dave_Stein> i know you guys mentioned cherry-picking, but i don't even know how to do that
[17:45:48] <Dave_Stein> i like having the fork under my name :D plus it'll be good for me to know in future ha
[17:45:50] <johnywp> Dave-Stein: yes, and I also need the ajax call to actually pass the variables... because now it's not passing them
[17:45:55] <ajpiano> well yeah, i could push to your fork
[17:45:58] <johnywp> the latter is more important of course
[17:46:24] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: first i would try interactive rebase
[17:46:36] <Dave_Stein> i think i tried that
[17:46:49] <Dave_Stein> i did something like git rebase -i HEAD~8 something like that
[17:46:49] <ajpiano> what happeend
[17:46:52] <ajpiano> yup
[17:46:54] <Dave_Stein> then it opened up in vi
[17:47:02] <ajpiano> yup
[17:47:02] <Dave_Stein> i changed the words to "edit" and changed the text
[17:47:11] <ajpiano> you don't want to edit anything though
[17:47:14] <ajpiano> you want to delete commits
[17:47:21] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: let me look up the function one sec, while im getting help from aj :)
[17:47:22] <ajpiano> (right?)
[17:47:30] <Dave_Stein> i want to delete 8 commits
[17:47:33] <ajpiano> yeah
[17:47:35] <Dave_Stein> and then do my original intention of updating 8 messages
[17:47:38] <johnywp> thank you Dave!
[17:47:44] <ajpiano> so you can do it all in one go
[17:47:52] <ajpiano> do like git rebase -i HEAD~20
[17:48:03] <ajpiano> straight up one set of dupes
[17:48:07] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[17:48:09] <ajpiano> straight up delete*
[17:48:13] <ajpiano> and then edit the commits
[17:48:16] <ajpiano> for the others
[17:48:18] <ajpiano> then :wq
[17:48:22] <ajpiano> just do this all on a new branch
[17:48:23] <ajpiano> and then push that
[17:48:25] <Dave_Stein> oh like literally hit d to delete the lines
[17:48:27] <Dave_Stein> and thats the magic?
[17:48:29] <ajpiano> yeah
[17:48:42] <Dave_Stein> so i got screwed when i changed the word pick to edit within vi?
[17:48:56] <ajpiano> i don't know what you did :x
[17:49:18] <Dave_Stein> so im gonna make a new branch of interactions??
[17:49:54] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: var data = {}; $('#form').find(':input').each(function() { data[ this.id ] = $(this).val() });
[17:50:02] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: then send that data as the data argument in ajax
[17:50:08] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: yep
[17:50:14] <ajpiano> you can rename it all back later
[17:50:38] <ajpiano> git checkout -b interactions-fix-my-git-mistakes
[17:50:39] <ajpiano> etc
[17:50:55] <Dave_Stein> and then i delete the old branch and rename the new one?
[17:51:01] <Dave_Stein> or ocmmit over the old one with new one?
[17:51:36] <ajpiano> yeah once you're sure everything is good
[17:52:00] <ajpiano> well you don't even have to delete
[17:52:17] <ajpiano> you can rename the old one to something else, and rename the new one to interactions, etc, keep it around
[17:52:22] <ajpiano> i think you can handle that part :p
[17:52:34] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:52:39] <Dave_Stein> okay i'll give it a shot
[17:52:49] <Dave_Stein> i hate how there's no good UI for git
[17:52:53] <Dave_Stein> i do love tortoise :)
[17:53:05] <ajpiano> you're on windows right?
[17:53:08] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[17:53:18] <ajpiano> bummer
[17:53:21] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: http://originblog.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/github-tips-removing-a-remote-branch/
[17:53:23] <ajpiano> will be relevant
[17:53:33] <Dave_Stein> cool
[17:53:44] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: you understand my answer?
[17:54:04] <Dave_Stein> look at me, i make top 1,000 websites but i don't know how to use git more than a 5 year old
[17:55:09] <ciss> Dave_Stein: regarding ui, i've heard smartgit being mentioned a couple of times
[17:55:51] <Dave_Stein> thanks ciss
[17:55:57] <Dave_Stein> i'll have to give it a look after doing this final hate
[17:56:01] <johnywp> :P
[17:56:04] <johnywp> any ideas Dave?
[17:56:27] <Dave_Stein> i sent it over
[17:56:34] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: var data = {}; $('#form').find(':input').each(function() { data[ this.id ] = $(this).val() });
[17:56:38] <ciss> the endless possibilities to fuck up your repository are amazing
[17:56:43] <Dave_Stein> slap data into the data arg of ajax
[17:57:03] <Dave_Stein> ciss: yup! although i gotta say SVN 5 years and i never made a mistake like this one
[17:57:05] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:57:40] <ciss> "bang! you're dead. wanna try again?"
[17:58:34] <ciss> i'm still hoping i get past that point before i have to do my first rebase
[17:58:39] <johnywp> hmmm
[17:58:40] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[17:59:13] <johnywp> Dave, could I please ask you to give me an example with actual variable names so that I can understand what's happening?
[17:59:24] <johnywp> i am basically trying to pass 3 variables
[17:59:37] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[17:59:41] <johnywp> thakn you!
[17:59:50] <johnywp> thank you too
[18:02:09] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/qgjjj/
[18:02:43] <johnywp> thank you so much!
[18:03:01] <jedimind> somewhere in that code is a hidden cornify
[18:03:15] <Dave_Stein> cornify?
[18:03:18] <johnywp> and that's going to pass all the data except from the submit??
[18:03:27] <jedimind> we should make that standard policy every time we write a code snippet for someone. just to make sure they're paying attention
[18:03:41] <jedimind> http://cornify.com/
[18:03:51] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:03:52] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:04:06] <Kaseano> is there a good way to fire pure JS with a jquery ajax call? I was going to create an empty div to append the <script>etc</script>
[18:04:53] <Kaseano> that seems kind of strange though.  I don't want to just add it onto the body, I'd like to have something I can erase because the user could make a large # of ajax requests, and I don't want to spam the source code
[18:05:05] <jedimind> uhm
[18:05:09] <jedimind> yeah that doesnt work like that
[18:05:14] <jedimind> you can just ajax a .js file into your dom
[18:05:17] <jedimind> and expect it to function
[18:05:21] <jedimind> can = cant*
[18:05:28] <Kaseano> aw.
[18:05:28] <MaC> hey, whats the best way to have a function run last in the stack?
[18:05:36] <Kaseano> I know you can call js functions w ajax
[18:06:14] <Kaseano> yeah I know I can load javascript into the dom with ajax and have it work.  Just wondering what the best way to do it was.
[18:06:37] <Kaseano> Maybe erasing it won't work though.
[18:07:03] <Kaseano> well actually no that should be fine too bc it's already loaded into the browsers memory after it loads regardless of the dom
[18:12:00] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i just went in such a circle, i deleted my local branches, repulled interactions lol
[18:12:09] <ajpiano> :/
[18:12:10] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i did :q! and it still went nuts
[18:12:14] <Dave_Stein> to do rebase
[18:12:16] <Dave_Stein> and i was like wtf
[18:12:21] <Dave_Stein> but now i see if i delete everything, rebase goes away
[18:12:25] <Dave_Stein> it ignores then
[18:12:27] <Dave_Stein> so im making progress haha
[18:12:36] <ajpiano> ok
[18:12:36] <ajpiano> :x
[18:12:42] <Dave_Stein> so okay im in interactions
[18:12:49] <Dave_Stein> then i do git branch -b interactions-switch
[18:12:55] <ajpiano> no
[18:12:58] <ajpiano> checkout -b
[18:13:01] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah whoops
[18:13:05] <johnywp> Dave: http://jsfiddle.net/qgjjj/1/
[18:13:29] <Dave_Stein> then i do git rebase -i HEAD~20
[18:13:39] <johnywp> I edited it and put everything within a function, but chances are that I made a syntax error... can you take a look please?
[18:13:50] <Dave_Stein> now i see my hell
[18:13:53] <johnywp> ps. j123 is my var for jquery
[18:14:14] <ajpiano> right
[18:14:19] <ajpiano> now delete the one set of commits
[18:14:25] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: j123("#loadedContent") should just be j123.ajax
[18:14:26] <ajpiano> don't even bother with editing the messages now
[18:14:28] <Dave_Stein> why on earth did you rename that?
[18:15:00] <Dave_Stein> its weird it does earliest at top - was throwin me off
[18:15:05] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: you have to do :wq
[18:15:09] <ajpiano> not just q
[18:15:15] <Dave_Stein> yeah i know i did q cause i wanted to cancel before
[18:15:19] <ajpiano> ah ok
[18:15:34] <ajpiano> it still does the rebase there is just no effect ostensibly
[18:15:42] <Dave_Stein> i know VI a lot better than git :P
[18:15:46] <johnywp> but I am trying to populate a div with this id with the output of ajax
[18:15:48] <ajpiano> hahaha
[18:15:54] <Dave_Stein> you need the success callback
[18:15:55] <ajpiano> ok ya never know
[18:16:01] <Dave_Stein> $.ajax @ johnywp please read that up
[18:16:42] <johnywp> i wll dave - taking it one step at a time.. but i feel like I am so close now
[18:17:23] <johnywp> is what I am trying to do not possible?
[18:17:31] <johnywp> populating a div with an .ajax output?
[18:17:36] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: could not apply 1f23646... Draggable: Fixed coding style, moved proprerties out of prototype
[18:17:45] <Dave_Stein> wt-fuck thats an old revision i didnt even touch
[18:17:54] <Dave_Stein> see this is where i screwed myself last time
[18:17:57] <ajpiano> ok so yeah fuck this
[18:18:04] <ajpiano> let's cherry pick
[18:18:07] <MaC> hey so how the hell does this each function work?
[18:18:15] <Dave_Stein> it loops through the collection
[18:18:21] <Dave_Stein> and this inside the function is the element
[18:18:26] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: go to master and create a new branch
[18:18:26] <Dave_Stein> there are code samples on the page i believe
[18:18:42] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: k im gonna dump my shit
[18:18:48] <Dave_Stein> from my local
[18:19:11] <Dave_Stein> and to switch to master i just do git checkout master
[18:19:12] <Dave_Stein> right
[18:19:17] <ajpiano> yep
[18:19:22] <johnywp> would i first run the ajax function
[18:19:35] <johnywp> and then use another function to pull the output from that and put it in the div?
[18:20:21] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: then create a new branch
[18:20:27] <ajpiano> and then you can try doing
[18:20:33] <Dave_Stein> okay so back at master, removed my gd branches
[18:20:47] <Dave_Stein> now ill do git checkout interactions-switch to create a new branch agin
[18:20:51] <Dave_Stein> but this time based on masters goodness
[18:20:54] <MaC> http://pastebin.com/HRKLnb7V
[18:21:08] <MaC> am I doing something wrong here? I need it to perform this test and action over each match
[18:21:20] <Dave_Stein> git checkout -b
[18:21:21] <Dave_Stein> rather
[18:21:24] <ajpiano> git cherry-pick 919b8911..8c4e4415
[18:21:25] <MaC> the function itself works on the first element, dunno about the each
[18:21:28] <ajpiano> yeah
[18:21:36] <Dave_Stein> johnywp, in the arugments do success : function( data ) { console.log( data) }
[18:21:38] <Dave_Stein> youll get the idea
[18:21:42] <ajpiano> and that should try to cherry-pick the whole range of comits
[18:21:48] <ajpiano> i've never done the range thing before so i don't know if it will work
[18:22:07] <ajpiano> MaC:  the syntax is way off
[18:22:10] <Dave_Stein> where did you get that commit range?
[18:22:17] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: off your interactions branch
[18:22:42] <Dave_Stein> 05b1d23990fac44996fb0c8c88275260d7f869fb looks like the first one
[18:22:46] <MaC> ajpiano: just how I used the each right?
[18:22:59] <Dave_Stein> $('.els').each( function() { var width= $(this).width(); } ) ;
[18:23:03] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: do you need to save the indivdual commits?
[18:23:23] <MaC> ohh I gotcha
[18:23:34] <ajpiano> MaC:  not really.... the whole like ... passing an assignment to jQuery.each doesn't really make sense.. what are you trying to iterate over
[18:23:35] <ajpiano> ok yeah
[18:23:38] <Dave_Stein> ah i see what youre sayin
[18:23:45] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein oh yeah i didn't go back far enough
[18:23:49] <Dave_Stein> so basically i want to cherry pick up to the last commit thats good
[18:23:52] <ajpiano> you can also cherry pick individually,
[18:23:56] <ajpiano> the commits you want
[18:24:05] <ajpiano> but yeah, it's literally what the name says
[18:24:08] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: did you try doing a merge --squash broken-branch
[18:24:09] <gnarf> ?
[18:24:10] <MaC> i need to check each image on the page with class .galleria-image-inline
[18:24:11] <ajpiano> go pick out that commit and put it on that bring
[18:24:19] <Dave_Stein> basically i want from the first commit up until the first "Draggable: Fixed when cssPosition is being set."
[18:24:23] <MaC> and if they match, I need to add margin
[18:24:26] <Dave_Stein> nope gnarf
[18:24:34] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: might as well try
[18:24:35] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:24:38] <gnarf> you're only a reset away
[18:24:39] <gnarf> :)
[18:24:56] <johnywp> now i get function statement requires a name
[18:25:00] <Dave_Stein> youre tellin me one way and aj is tellin me another...
[18:25:00] <gnarf> it will reduce your whole interactions branch down to a single commit
[18:25:04] <johnywp> for data
[18:25:08] <Dave_Stein> johnywp: link me the latest fiddle
[18:25:12] <gnarf> well aj's way wont restore your branch either
[18:25:12] <ajpiano> git cherry-pick 05b1d239..8c4e4415
[18:25:17] <Dave_Stein> yeah i'd rather cherry pick
[18:25:18] <gnarf> but we can try
[18:25:19] <gnarf> :)
[18:25:23] <Dave_Stein> i like commit history
[18:25:24] <Dave_Stein> :)
[18:25:36] <gnarf> either way yer gonna have to do a push -f at some point
[18:25:36] <johnywp> http://jsfiddle.net/qgjjj/2/
[18:25:44] <ajpiano> gnarf: not necessarily
[18:25:59] <ajpiano> he can delete the upstream branch and then push this one again :p
[18:25:59] <danheberden> in basketball, sometimes they run `git cherry-pick basket`
[18:26:02] <bapi_> what is a toggleFade equalent but always displays the div?
[18:26:08] <gnarf> ajpiano: thats just a push -f
[18:26:14] <ajpiano> no u
[18:26:16] <bapi_> I want to show a div with a fade
[18:26:25] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: so if i do part of the commit number does it know whats up or do i need to use what you said, but with the helluvalong one?
[18:26:38] <Dave_Stein> ?fadeIn @ bapi_
[18:26:38] <bot-t> bapi_, .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[18:26:39] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: SHA..SHA denotes a range
[18:26:52] <Dave_Stein> okay so lets see if that magic line works :)
[18:26:54] <gnarf> danheberden: speaking of basketball, look at these hoops https://gist.github.com/f7491a188a70437dce7b
[18:26:56] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: you can use any substring from the beginning of a SHA to identify a commit
[18:26:58] <Dave_Stein> #learning
[18:27:00] <ajpiano> usually 6 or 7 chars is enough
[18:27:11] <gnarf> ^^^ stupid amount of BS to handle for unit testing focus/blur
[18:27:41] <Dave_Stein> it couldnt apply one of the commits
[18:27:44] <Dave_Stein> what does that mean usually
[18:27:58] <Dave_Stein> my draggable.js is conflicting with the masters?
[18:28:01] <gnarf> yes
[18:28:22] <Dave_Stein> so how do i force a "use mine" on this branch while cherry picking?
[18:28:23] <gnarf> your draggable.js that commit started on and masters are different enough that it can't auto-apply the diff
[18:28:25] <danheberden> gnarf mmm focus/blur
[18:29:31] <gnarf> so like what happened to draggable.js between your branch and master?
[18:29:48] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: what didnt happen? haha
[18:29:49] <gnarf> (( we should prolly be having this convo in ui-dev ;) ))
[18:29:59] <Dave_Stein> haha yeah ill go there then

[18:32:14] <ryanneufeld> COLDHEAD STOLE MY SANDWICH
[18:33:04] <overtherainbow> Can IDs for HTML fields be numbers?
[18:33:17] <overtherainbow> For example can I have a div id='1484'
[18:33:18] <Dave_Stein> overtherainbow: i wouldn't do that ever
[18:33:19] <ryanneufeld> overtherainbow: yes
[18:33:35] <Dave_Stein> that's bad practice isn't it
[18:33:36] <ryanneufeld> Dave_Stein: why not?
[18:33:51] <ryanneufeld> Bad practice how?
[18:33:51] <Dave_Stein> if you're on a large website and people start getting into the habit of mapping like DB IDs to IDs of elements
[18:34:02] <Dave_Stein> you can have overlapping IDs
[18:34:08] <overtherainbow> ...
[18:34:12] <overtherainbow> that's exactly what I'm doing
[18:34:18] <johnywp> thank you so much!!
[18:34:19] <johnywp> i will
[18:34:20] <danheberden> at least prefix them - "user_12345"
[18:34:21] * overtherainbow makes a note to append dbname_num
[18:34:27] <ryanneufeld> overtherainbow: then I would use a data-id=
[18:34:44] <Dave_Stein> i usually do like id="photo-25" and if i want to select by it add an attribute
[18:34:54] <Dave_Stein> so <img id="photo-20" photo_id="20" />
[18:34:57] <ryanneufeld> Dave_Stein: then you have to parse out the id
[18:34:59] <Dave_Stein> but then you most likely dont eve n need the id
[18:35:13] <Dave_Stein> heh yeah i used to do that but then realized using attributes was way better
[18:35:13] <ryanneufeld> so you could go <img data-id="25>
[18:35:34] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[18:35:38] <ryanneufeld> Whys that?
[18:35:43] <johnywp> hmm
[18:35:45] <Dave_Stein> i prefer specificity so i'd have like <img sandwich_id=25 /> vs <img salad_id=25 />
[18:35:50] <johnywp> still not getting it to work for some reason
[18:35:58] <Dave_Stein> so if you had a page with al ist of sandwiches and salads, youd be safe
[18:36:14] <Dave_Stein> cause you never know where two sets of data might collide in future
[18:36:53] <danheberden> or start using something like backbone that makes things easier for you
[18:37:18] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: crazy talk
[18:37:39] <danheberden> i'm good at crazy
[18:37:47] <johnywp> would I replace all instances of $ with j123?
[18:39:08] <johnywp> and do i need to replace anything_at_all with something?
[19:01:25] <Matt_> hey can I get jquery/php help here?
[19:02:19] <Guest46419> I'm loading a file with .load(), into a div, and in that file I have php which is checking for a GET variable but it isn't working
[19:02:35] <Guest46419> I get Udefined index
[19:04:26] <Guest46419> Hello?
[19:05:00] <ajpiano> Guest46419: what is the url you're using
[19:05:23] <ajpiano> jQuery uses a POST if you do $("#foo").load("url", {data})
[19:05:57] <coldhead> Guest46419: Hello
[19:06:03] <ajpiano> you can trick it into using a get by doing $("#foo").load("url.php?" + $.param( data ), {});
[19:06:08] <Guest46419> So I can do $('#div').load('get vars','page.php');
[19:06:14] <ajpiano> you can trick it into using a get by doing $("#foo").load("url.php?" + $.param( data ));
[19:06:35] <Guest46419> oh
[19:07:10] <Guest46419> I don't want to do it that way
[19:07:20] <Guest46419> is there another way to load it
[19:07:24] <ajpiano> lol what
[19:07:26] <ajpiano> what do you want to do
[19:07:43] <ajpiano> what do you have right now
[19:09:50] <Guest46419> http://jsfiddle.net/k6SwS/
[19:10:03] <yedimind> sigh, apparently its impossible to find a front end developer who's skinned bing maps
[19:10:18] <yedimind> not that im surprised, but give a man a break
[19:12:41] <Guest46419> coldhead: hi
[19:13:20] <ryanneufeld> don't talk to coldhead, he steals sammiches
[19:13:24] <ajpiano> Guest46419: so... what...
[19:13:36] <Guest46419> ?
[19:13:48] <ajpiano> Guest46419: you want to put a variable in a GET, you have to put the var in the url manually
[19:13:58] <ajpiano> you could also use $_POST and send the data in an object
[19:14:16] <Guest46419> its on my products page, and I want another way to do it
[19:15:03] <ajpiano> you can do $.get("url", data, function(data) { $("#something").html(data);  });
[19:15:06] <ajpiano> that's another way to do it
[19:15:29] <ajpiano> load is probably a little bit leaner in your usecase....
[19:17:55] <yedimind> i may as well start looking for big foot, it'll be easier
[19:18:39] <ryanneufeld> yedimind: huh?
[19:18:56] <yedimind> been looking for someone who's worked with bing maps api
[19:19:01] <ryanneufeld> ah
[19:19:10] <ryanneufeld> you know google has a maps api?
[19:19:23] <yedimind> yupp, my asstasstic client apparently doesnt
[19:19:33] <yedimind> or they do but they think that google maps is "ugly"
[19:19:48] <ryanneufeld> but it's better readable
[19:19:57] <yedimind> i almost reached through the phone and punched him in the face when he said that
[19:20:02] <ryanneufeld> lol
[19:20:05] <coldhead> you suck at sleep, ryry
[19:20:18] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I didn't say I was going to sleep
[19:20:25] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: Is said i was going home
[19:20:28] <coldhead> oh i just assumed
[19:20:30] <ryanneufeld> I was at work
[19:20:39] <yedimind> when i finish working, i sleep
[19:20:42] <coldhead> bunk time to me means sleeping in your bunk
[19:20:49] <ryanneufeld> OH
[19:20:50] <ryanneufeld> haha
[19:20:54] <coldhead> but to you it means having a quick handjob
[19:20:55] <ryanneufeld> bunk o clock
[19:21:03] <coldhead> right it's all clear now
[19:21:07] <coldhead> carry on
[19:21:10] <yedimind> its not a handjob if he does it himself
[19:21:17] <yedimind> just... you know, clarifying
[19:21:21] <ryanneufeld> I only do the stranger
[19:21:29] <ryanneufeld> with coldhead's hand
[19:21:33] <yedimind> that actually made me lol
[19:21:40] <yedimind> and then cry a little
[19:22:07] <yedimind> ok seriously i will give anyone $100 if they find me a bing maps front end guy, i dont even need anything fancy just some light theming
[19:22:10] <coldhead> it is ever thus
[19:23:29] <yedimind> if that aint the truth, how do you think i got stuck here ?
[19:23:44] <yedimind> "oh hey we need a quick couple of pages coded and thrown into wordpress, 5 day turnaround, simple things"
[19:25:04] <yedimind> 2 hours later after phone call ... 3rd party xml feed for movie feeds that needs to be sortable and displayed in two different ways, search integrated into this xml feed, custom post types with movie information, member signup with multi step / multi member signup at once, carousels, oh and "btw" bing maps api with integrated and branded directions to the location
[19:25:42] <yedimind> and probably something else im forgetting at the moment
[19:25:59] <ryanneufeld> is this all you have to do for the next 5 days?
[19:26:02] <yedimind> oh right, a site search with predictive search results "thats easy, right?"
[19:26:15] <yedimind> yeah, oh and i have a full time job
[19:26:26] <ryanneufeld> easy, yes, hard on the server if it's high load, you betcha
[19:26:48] <yedimind> i mean i'll do it and it'll be fine, and skin them good amounts of money
[19:27:13] <coldhead> the folly is in clients thinking anyone visits sites that aren't facebook and youtube
[19:28:23] <yedimind> yeah, to be honest, im fine with that, as long as they pay
[19:28:37] <yedimind> and there's still validity in standalone sites
[19:28:58] <coldhead> sure, FOR PAEDOPHILES
[19:29:10] <yedimind> lol
[19:29:33] <yedimind> fuck its already 10:30 i should code this layout
[19:29:55] <ajpiano> fuck it's 10:30 i should play this stranger in internet scrabble
[19:31:27] <yedimind> aj sometimes i wonder how you and paul and ben etc find the time to do everything
[19:31:37] <yedimind> not sometimes... often.
[19:31:40] <yedimind> i often think about you
[19:31:44] <coldhead> amphetamines
[19:31:46] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: doesn't sleep
[19:31:51] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: is always horny
[19:32:08] <ryanneufeld> ben_alman: is just, well the cowboy and cowboys are awesome
[19:32:09] <ajpiano> yedimind: that's the secret
[19:32:20] <ajpiano> all the time you spend wondering about me, is when you have to be following your dreams
[19:32:28] <ajpiano> of internet scrabble
[19:32:40] <yedimind> i guess every 30 seconds counts
[19:32:45] <ngharo> hey jcuties
[19:32:52] * yedimind blushes
[19:33:23] * coldhead np: nina nastasia - jim's room
[19:33:50] <coldhead> my dream is just to make it through each day
[19:34:03] <coldhead> it seems unattainable
[19:34:10] <ryanneufeld> my dream is to not wake up dead
[19:34:19] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[19:34:19] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[19:34:20] <coldhead> that is my nightmare
[19:35:07] <yedimind> my dream is to be free in a couple of years
[19:35:11] <yedimind> and sit on my yacht
[19:35:39] <yedimind> and write books and code crazy interfaces and give them away for free
[19:35:48] <yedimind> except license them to corporations
[19:37:47] <yedimind> and i already have the floatation device, now its just acquiring freedom that's proving difficult
[19:39:40] <coldhead> it's the hardest thing
[19:39:50] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[19:39:58] <ryanneufeld> that's what she said?
[19:41:30] <coldhead> not at my age she doesn't
[19:41:41] <coldhead> at least.... not to me
[19:41:51] <yedimind> was just gonna say, she tells me all the time
[19:42:10] <coldhead> i was once like you
[19:43:51] <ryanneufeld> Fat, 30, married and gainfully employed?
[19:44:08] <ryanneufeld> missed a comma after married
[19:44:15] <coldhead> well, i was 30
[19:44:18] <coldhead> 30 years ago
[19:44:43] <ryanneufeld> you're in your 60s? and you know how to use IRC
[19:44:56] <ajpiano> he was once also someone for whom being feld was stil neu

[19:46:39] <coldhead> that's the only job that makes sense to me
[19:46:42] <gnarf> git makes it even more dirty
[19:47:04] <ryanneufeld> with all that forking and merging

[19:47:17] <gnarf> reseting head
[19:47:38] <gnarf> and omg, the detached head
[19:49:14] <coldhead> i deserve a club sandwich

[19:50:26] <ryanneufeld> CLUB SANDWICHES FOR EVERYONE
[19:50:32] <ryanneufeld> NURSES FOR EVERYONE!
[19:50:46] <ryanneufeld> coldhead is buying

[19:51:27] <ryanneufeld> oh, right, you're on a fixed income
[19:51:35] <ryanneufeld> NO NURSES FOR ANYONE
[19:51:37] <coldhead> wait apparently there's been some kind of global financial crisis
[19:51:41] <coldhead> why wasn't i informed!
[19:51:48] <ryanneufeld> NO CLUB SANDWICHES FOR ANYONE!!
[19:51:53] <coldhead> CNN BOT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
[19:52:55] <superjacaman> coldhead and the usualy sarcasm
[19:53:27] * Phrogz and the usually grammar
[19:53:45] <superjacaman> sorry
[19:55:18] <ryanneufeld> if was wanting to include a template with a jquery plugin, would it be acceptable to store it in a private var? or does html in JS still make john resig cry?
[19:57:19] <coldhead> just don't tell him
[19:57:28] <ajpiano> i think it's still pretty reasonable
[19:57:43] <ajpiano> if it made him cry creating elems from strings of html would have been in the lib in the first place :p
[19:57:52] <ryanneufeld> haha
[19:58:20] <ryanneufeld> just a div with a span inside it
[19:59:40] <coldhead> maybe he just carries the pain inside him, aj
[20:00:10] <ajpiano> there's barely any room in there when you take the ever growing seed of the demon
[20:00:26] <ajpiano> unless they are one in the same?
[20:01:28] <coldhead> i think the demon feeds on the pain
[20:01:33] <coldhead> and it makes him strong
[20:01:39] <coldhead> that is where maori people come from
[20:02:49] <ajpiano> that makes me laugh so much
[20:02:57] <ajpiano> wuch a stunning ethnography
[20:03:43] <ryanneufeld> THAS RASIS
[20:13:24] <ryanneufeld> I <3 git + git-svn
[20:27:48] <WillMarshall> What's the name of the event on a Sortable() when a draggable bound to that Sortable via connectToSortable is dropped
[20:37:46] <chingana> i'm developing a plugin that needs to apply styling to each of its elements. is addClass() the best way to do this, trusting that users won't use inline styles?
[20:45:38] <coldhead> chingana: how are you going to add the CSS?

[21:31:19] <kborchers> :)
[21:38:55] <hello> hi
[21:39:03] <hello> so
[21:39:13] <hello> who is there
[21:40:40] <snover> such patience.
[21:40:41] <coldhead> you suck, hello
[21:42:03] <snover> i wish, coldhead
[21:43:59] <coldhead> there's always next time
[21:44:41] <dogarrhea2_> ARGH
[21:44:47] <dogarrhea2_> why is anim so broken
[21:44:56] <dogarrhea2_> why are so many things broken in jquery ui and jquery..
[21:45:22] <snover> ?doesn't work @ dogarrhea2_
[21:45:23] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[21:45:38] <dogarrhea2_> yea yea i know.
[21:45:42] <dogarrhea2_> anim just bounces up and down
[21:45:48] <dogarrhea2_> in chrome. not in ie8
[21:45:59] <coldhead> i think things are broken because jquery is more interested in marketing than in actual solutions
[21:46:42] <dogarrhea2_> hrm i'm banned from chrome for some reason
[21:47:10] <dogarrhea2_> i think there also is a bug with images of width 30 and height 70
[21:47:32] <dogarrhea2_> when you zoom in at 83% in chrome. it adds a tick mark next to the image for some reason
[21:47:45] <WillMarshall> Hey guys! I'm having some serious issues with Sortable(). Even when I set axis: x, and tolerance: intersect, it's only responding to mouse overlap on the sortable elements
[21:48:02] <WillMarshall> It's refusing to respond to overlap of the elements themselves :/
[21:48:04] <WillMarshall> Any ideas?
[21:52:40] <WillMarshall> I've got a test-case here: http://jsfiddle.net/UWQ92/
[21:56:24] <Spadeski> Hey uhh if I have all the code and a jquery uploader working can someone help me customize it if you have time ?
[22:13:18] <Zxurian> if two $.ajax requests are next to each other in the code, the second one should not have to wait for the first one to finish, correct?
[22:14:28] <ryanseddon> nope, unless you've made them synchronous
[22:15:45] <Zxurian> that's what I thougth
[22:18:20] <Zxurian> is there a proper method to load an image via ajax?
[22:19:37] <ryanseddon> noy really, it'll give you the image as binary
[22:19:46] <ryanseddon> s/noy/not
[22:20:16] <Zxurian> grr
[22:21:09] <Phrogz> Zxurian: You don't need AJAX; just create a new Image and set the .src; it'll load async.
[22:21:36] <Docwyatt> Is this the right place to ask questions in regards to jQuery UI and CSS?
[22:21:59] <Zxurian> it dones't though
[22:23:55] <CrazyTux[m]> Hey guys - I'm using jquery and trying to use the buttonset plugin - however it appears there is no easy way to define a callback once a button state changes from checked/unchecked ... any thoughts?  Long story short I am running into a race condition currently between a jquery bind event to the label and the actual .buttonset() action modifying the "labels" and a 3rd custom function I've created in order to get "active" checked buttons.
[22:24:16] <Zxurian> rather, in test, using the .load method, other javascript items that are fetched wait until it's done before processing
[22:26:16] <Zxurian> ex. http://arcadia.selfip.org/clintonct - I want the background image to load async, so it doesn't keep the other elements (accuweather, google translate) from loading, but those two elements wait until the background image is loaded before runnig themselves
[22:28:24] <Docwyatt> How does one force the background image in the ui-widget-header to fill the whole div? I created a custom themeroller CSS - works in FF, but not in IE.
[22:34:04] <dogarrhea2_> i'm starting to think there's a disconnect between append as you see it on screen, and a javascript object having a "one to many" has-a relationship..
[22:34:40] <dogarrhea2_> you can append multiple children to some element... why not have a javascript object represent that element and use jquery.data to represent the has-a/one to many... but somehow you get visual bugs
[22:34:52] <dogarrhea2_> god i hate these stupid paradigms that don't work
[22:35:23] <dogarrhea2_> and the mythical manmonth doesn't really help at all. "Everything in software is broken. just hack it and make it work"
[22:35:42] <dogarrhea2_> maybe it's just there to tell future managers: "Have sympathy for it workers since everything is broken"
[22:35:52] <dogarrhea2_> bah i'm rambling back to redesign
[22:36:43] <coldhead> how about that euclidean geometry
[23:02:00] <dogarrhea2_> so i have appended some items.
[23:02:06] <dogarrhea2_> are these items inherently undraggable?
[23:02:24] <dogarrhea2_> er, unanimatiable
[23:02:26] <dogarrhea2_> they are draggable
[23:02:44] <dogarrhea2_> but $(".draggableitems").animate does not move them at all
[23:03:53] <joshsmith> I've been away from jQuery for awhile and am having trouble doing something exceedingly simple
[23:04:07] <joshsmith> oh hey sean`
[23:04:22] <joshsmith> we joined at the same time
[23:04:37] <coldhead> besties!
[23:04:50] <joshsmith> okay so anyway
[23:05:16] <joshsmith> all I want to do is take an array of strings (single words in this case), and rotate them out in another string
[23:05:19] <joshsmith> fading in/out
[23:06:50] <coldhead> that doesn't seem simple to me!
[23:07:05] <coldhead> once i get more experience with jquery i'd like to try something like that
[23:07:20] <joshsmith> haha coldhead
[23:09:33] <coldhead> so for the fading, i guess you want to look at some of the google results for sequential animation chaining in jQuery
[23:09:41] <coldhead> so they fade in one after the other
[23:09:57] <coldhead> and for the cycling i guess you want a counter that is reset to 0 when i >= array.length
[23:10:40] <Tant102> idx = (idx + 1) % array.length;
[23:11:05] <dogarrhea2_> oh. anything that is  not position relative cannot be animated
[23:12:22] <joshsmith> hm reading an SO post now
[23:15:11] <aktest> test 1 2
[23:15:17] <dogarrhea2_> testicle 1 2
[23:15:30] <aktest> haha, cool my IRC client speaks
[23:15:46] <astropirate> Well, this is some bull shit, the only sane clientside templating system is being discontinued :(  jquery-tmpl
[23:15:48] <mekwall> did it pronounce testicle correctly?
[23:16:04] <Axsuul> does console.log happen after the script executes?
[23:16:12] <aktest> by that I mean, I can say stuff in the channel. Working on basic functionality.
[23:16:22] <mekwall> astropirate: jquery-tmpl is slow and cumbersome
[23:16:29] <dogarrhea2_> i taught one of my nephews to say "An octopus has 8 testicles"
[23:16:30] <Axsuul> astropirate: mustache?
[23:16:40] <mekwall> astropirate: and there's really no need for a client-side only template language
[23:17:40] <astropirate> Asuul, mustache doesn't provide for "else" logic, requires you to create that in yoru views, i already have my data as a JSON/object i dont't want to go and modify it all the time to meet its requirements
[23:17:53] <astropirate> mekwall, lol i used to think that too, then i started coding client side :p
[23:18:12] <mekwall> astropirate: what I mean is, there's no need for a client-side ONLY templating language :)
[23:18:35] <mekwall> templates that can be used both client-side and server-side is the shizzle
[23:18:54] <Axsuul> Can anyone care to explain to my why console.log behaves this way (really short code): https://gist.github.com/d5fdcabaf44d8d0a29fb
[23:19:28] <astropirate> mekwall, ohh i don't really care which one it is here, diffrente languages so not big a deal
[23:19:33] <snover> Axsuul: in webkit, console.log is not a synchronous operation
[23:19:41] <astropirate> just something that gets the job done
[23:19:44] <aktest> astropirate: You can do "else" in mustache with an inverted section.
[23:19:45] <mekwall> astropirate: what are you running on backend?
[23:19:50] <aktest> {{^condition}}
[23:20:04] <astropirate> aktest, ahhhh thats all i needed, didn't find that in the docs
[23:20:10] <astropirate> maybe i didn't read close enough
[23:20:21] <astropirate> mekwall, php
[23:20:30] <Axsuul> snover: ah, hmm ok thanks. so what should i use to debug... alert?
[23:20:31] <astropirate> mekwall, I'ma Node.js guy though
[23:20:42] <snover> Axsuul: um, no, heh.
[23:22:17] <snover> Axsuul: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=50316
[23:22:50] <mekwall> astropirate: cool :) same here
[23:23:11] <astropirate> mekwall, got github account?
[23:23:16] <mekwall> astropirate: sure
[23:23:41] <mekwall> astropirate: http://github.com/mekwall ofc.
[23:24:04] <Axsuul> snover: thanks
[23:24:09] <Axsuul> jesus christ, i just wasted an hour
[23:24:16] <Axsuul> on that console.log bug
[23:24:39] <coldhead> think of it as an investment in not getting tripped up by it again
[23:24:56] <mekwall> Axsuul: it's not a bug :P
[23:26:44] <Axsuul> i consider it a bug
[23:26:52] <aktest> astropirate: btw, my IRC connection right now is powered by node.js  ;-)
[23:27:31] <astropirate> aktest, say what? how does that work?
[23:27:46] <astropirate> it provides a web interface?
[23:28:00] <astropirate> or have you hacked up REPL? :D
[23:28:24] <aktest> astropirate: I'm creating one, based on node-irc (https://github.com/akavlie/web-irc)
[23:28:40] <Axsuul> guess the solution is to use Firefox
[23:29:42] <mekwall> astropirate: what I think would be cool is something that makes javascript aware of your templates (partials I guess) and not to actually parse them :)
[23:29:44] <astropirate> aktest, lol would suck if some user gets banned from a network while using this service
[23:30:28] <astropirate> mekwall, mustache support partials
[23:31:18] <aktest> astropirate: you mean with the inability to switch IP addresses or something (if it were hosted)?
[23:31:21] <mekwall> astropirate: yeah I know that
[23:31:29] <aktest> this wouldn't be the first web irc client, in any case (qwebirc.org)
[23:32:12] <astropirate> aktest, i mean everyone is connected from the same IP address, as far as the IRC server is concerned, it would be easy for one rotten egg to ruin it
[23:32:47] <astropirate> but i'd love a service like that, not having to open up another application
[23:34:30] <aktest> astropirate: I believe that IRC bans are based on user maks, not just IP address.
[23:34:46] <mekwall> astropirate: I'm building one myself in node.js ;)
[23:34:53] <mekwall> astropirate: haven't had much time to put into it though
[23:35:23] <Dantman> user masks are easy to fake... the @... hostname is just a reverse dns of the ip...
[23:35:24] <astropirate> aktest, i don't think so, because then bans would be meaningless if you could just change your nick
[23:35:32] <Dantman> FreeNode does have a gateway system though
[23:35:42] <Dantman> I'm not sure how it works.
[23:36:12] <Dantman> But you can register a web gateway or something and have the @... portion become something like @gateway/foo/XXXXXXXX
[23:36:14] <astropirate> aktest, woops misread your comment
[23:36:32] <Dantman> Where foo is your gateway name, and the XXXX is usually something like the IP of the user connecting TO the gateway.
[23:36:53] <Dantman> Then gateway users can be banned by ip. And bad gateways can be banned by name.
[23:37:20] <aktest> astropirate: I'll have to seek some input on that from others that know more about that aspect of IRC. I heard a bit of discussion about the same IP issue from a freenode guy irc qwebirc, but didn't get the whole picture.
[23:38:28] <coldhead> please kill me
[23:38:38] <astropirate> for a fee...
[23:38:42] <Spadeski> sup coldhead
[23:38:52] <Spadeski> and astropirate << lmao
[23:39:29] <jrangore> i'm developing a plugin using the widget factory, bridging it, and i get a typeerror about jQuery not having a myPlugin method. all i'm doing is $.widget(("namespace.myWidget", {...})) $.widget.bridge("myWidget", $.namespace.myWidget)
[23:39:32] <jrangore> am i missing something?
[23:40:12] <jrangore> excuse the double parentheses
[23:41:08] <jrangore> calling $("div").myWidget();
[23:42:06] <coldhead> jrangore: the best person to ask about such matters is ajpiano
[23:42:11] <coldhead> but i assume he is azzzleep
[23:42:20] <xp_prg> hi all, can I put javascript anywhere in my web page or does it have to be in head?
[23:43:31] <jrangore> coldhead: thanks
[23:43:39] <xp_prg> hello, anyone know?
[23:44:35] <Spadeski> xp_prg anywhere as long as its in <Script> tags and your function is used after its declared in some cases
[23:44:40] <astropirate> xp_prg, you can have it anywhere
[23:45:17] <Spadeski> alright anyone here familiar with json or w/e the hell it is
[23:45:36] <coldhead> i've read the wikipedia article about json
[23:46:11] <astropirate> Spadeski, whats up
[23:46:26] <Spadeski> Alright then well im I got this plugin ( only source ) and Its all setup just idk how to use the plugin with the form
[23:46:48] <Spadeski> its for uploading images and showinfo when done and id like to add a percentage vallue somewhere
[23:47:50] <Spadeski> http://75.241.108.184/upload/upload.rar
[23:48:04] <astropirate> Spadeski, can you pastie please?
[23:48:13] <Spadeski> uhh yeah sure
[23:50:43] <Spadeski> astropirate:  this is files.php, uploader,html, and jquery.form.js plugin http://pastebin.com/G9PJBmZd
[23:52:16] <astropirate> Spadeski, what do you mean by "add a percentage value somehwere"  do you want to add it on the server?
[23:52:28] <astropirate> or send it TO the server
[23:52:49] <Spadeski> I want it too upload the file
[23:53:05] <Spadeski> and show a percentage of how much is uplaoded at a time or send back when its done without reloading
[23:54:26] <coldhead> have you considered just letting people send you their files on floppy disk?
[23:54:39] <patrick99e99> is there a way to dynamically call a method on a jquery object?
[23:54:40] <coldhead> then they can use the courier tracking website to see how it has progressed
[23:54:45] <coldhead> "Out for delivery"
[23:54:49] <patrick99e99> like say I want var foo = "show"
[23:54:51] <coldhead> "Received at warehouse"
[23:55:03] <Spadeski> coldhead jokes are not funny told twice :)
[23:55:04] <patrick99e99> and I want to do blah.send(foo)
[23:55:10] <Spadeski> nah thats not true
[23:55:12] <Spadeski> was  still funny
[23:55:13] <patrick99e99> to call .show() on it
[23:55:19] <coldhead> it's my first day telling that joke, Spadeski
[23:55:29] <Spadeski> mmhmm just like jquery
[23:55:30] <coldhead> you must be thinking of someone else
[23:55:31] <Spadeski> gotcha ;)
[23:56:24] <coldhead> patrick99e99: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359788/how-to-execute-a-javascript-function-when-i-have-its-name-as-a-string
[23:56:32] <coldhead> it's so not ruby :)
[23:58:04] <patrick99e99> coldhead: but I want to do this on a jquery object...  like $("#foo").show()
[23:58:31] <mekwall> patrick99e99: $("#foo")[foo]();
[23:58:37] <mekwall> if foo is show :)
[23:58:57] <patrick99e99> mekwall: ahhh
[23:58:57] <patrick99e99> right
[23:58:58] <patrick99e99> ok cool!
[23:58:59] <patrick99e99> thanks
[23:59:07] <mekwall> no
[23:59:08] <mekwall> problem
