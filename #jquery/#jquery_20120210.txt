[00:08:34] <LukeNukem> someone?
[00:09:24] <Xotix> hi
[00:09:41] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/CfPz7kGk shouldn't data.src give me the src defined in the json?
[00:10:00] <mindis|wurk> LukeNukem yourobject.click( function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); should do it. can't really mess it up much as long as the click event works
[00:11:48] <LukeNukem>     $("#cancel_pic_234").click(function(remove) {
[00:11:48] <LukeNukem>        remove.preventDefault();
[00:12:00] <LukeNukem> Does not work :<
[00:12:28] <mindis|wurk> have you checked if the click event is triggered at all?
[00:12:41] <LukeNukem> how do i check that
[00:13:05] <Xotix> console.log('im triggered');
[00:14:00] <mindis|wurk> i would prefer alert in this case since it pauses the execution at that time
[00:15:02] <LukeNukem> ok its not being triggered.
[00:15:04] <LukeNukem> what do i do now?
[00:15:32] <mindis|wurk> that implies your elements id (or the whole selector) is wrong. we can't help with that
[00:16:08] <LukeNukem> ok
[00:16:17] <prometh> luke skywalker was a pussy
[00:17:11] <prometh> and duke nukem was better in 3d
[00:17:31] <LukeNukem> okay
[00:17:35] <prometh> :)
[00:17:45] <Xotix> LukeNukem, you can do e.g. $('myFoo a').click(function() {return false});
[00:17:45] <prometh> i am right, you are wrong
[00:18:20] <Xotix> put it on the a
[00:18:47] <mindis|wurk> Xotix this may be stating the obvious but you ARE aware you're trying to set data.key in the src attribute instead of data.src, right?
[00:19:48] <LukeNukem> prometh, what do you mean by that?
[00:20:02] <prometh> duke nukem 3d was awesome
[00:20:24] <Xotix> mindis\ work, didn't receive an object but an string. I know that i do key. the status thing already didn't work. :)  But anyway, i used the plugin wrong, thats probably why i've otten an string isntead of an object
[00:20:28] <prometh> forever didn't last very long
[00:20:30] <Xotix> got it but thanks
[00:20:39] <mindis|wurk> k
[00:20:58] <mindis|wurk> also just type mindis and press tab to autocomplete ;)
[00:21:21] <LukeNukem> Um, my name has nothing to do with Duke Nukem
[00:21:22] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/836286/
[00:21:34] <prometh> yes it does.
[00:21:42] <prometh> you are dissing duke nukem.
[00:21:45] <prometh> admit it!
[00:21:59] <LukeNukem> nope.avi
[00:22:12] <prometh> oo, that sounds like a good movie
[00:22:30] <prometh> are you giving duke nukem a lightsaber?
[00:22:46] <mindis|wurk> LukeNukem that code doesn't help one bit since there's no page to see if it has an element with the id #add_pic_23
[00:23:26] <mindis|wurk> which, of course, you should be able to check yourself
[00:23:44] <LukeNukem> OK this should help, its view src..also an element liek that does exist
[00:23:44] <LukeNukem> http://paste.ubuntu.com/836288/
[00:23:47] <LukeNukem> like*
[00:27:16] <mindis|wurk> so it seems. well, i'll hazard a guess then that the document might not be ready when you define the element since you're going about it in such a messy way
[00:27:29] <mindis|wurk> agh. event, not element
[00:27:51] <LukeNukem> ok
[00:27:55] <LukeNukem> so how do i fix it
[00:28:09] <mindis|wurk> assuming there's nothing broken on the page that throws errors of course
[00:28:36] <mindis|wurk> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[00:30:14] <LukeNukem> cmon, i dont wanna go through all that right now
[00:30:46] <mindis|wurk> you obviously need to
[00:31:20] <mindis|wurk> because it's in the hell jquery section
[00:31:23] <mindis|wurk> *hello
[00:34:03] <LukeNukem> do i need to put the script to alert triggered in another script tags
[00:34:04] <LukeNukem> o.o
[00:34:42] <mindis|wurk> you shouldn't have multiple <scripts> all over the page in the first place
[00:35:01] <LukeNukem> what else do i do then?
[00:35:04] <LukeNukem> put em in a js file?
[00:35:10] <mindis|wurk> that's one option
[00:35:30] <LukeNukem> another option is?
[00:35:45] <mindis|wurk> but i didn't want to get you on that as your page is an unvalidatable mess as a whole
[00:37:09] <sasori> i have an <h2>with 2 classes .. <h2 class="title first">blahblah</h2> ....how to select that?
[00:37:26] <LukeNukem> mindis|wurk, so what do i do? also the other scripts are coming from includes
[00:38:28] <mindis|wurk> sigh. well you could put all your pagespecific scripts under one script tag in the head if you like but we're not here to teach you how to become a webdesigner
[00:39:01] <LukeNukem> well my friend told me to define (IN PHP) $script  = "src to my js file" and $script is output in header file so the js is included
[00:39:02] <LukeNukem> :>
[00:39:04] <LukeNukem> i think i can do that
[00:42:13] <ruckus_> I'm trying to get the height of a div on document ready
[00:42:32] <theBrettman> which height?
[00:42:32] <ruckus_> I get the div the first time and it seems to work
[00:42:56] <ruckus_> but then the 2nd time I get a different height
[00:43:05] <ruckus_> This is what I have for my code:
[00:43:28] <theBrettman> just put code in jsbin?
[00:43:40] <ruckus_> right okay
[00:43:48] <theBrettman> or jsfiddle if it's working ok again
[00:44:52] <prometh> hmm
[00:45:40] <Ortund> http://www.loganyoung.za.net ... The jquery at the bottom here doesn't seem to be working... any ideas?
[00:45:43] <prometh> say i do this varname=$("li"); $("a", varname.exclude(".class"));   ?
[00:45:58] <prometh> is it possible to do the exclude thing?
[00:47:10] <prometh> ah... not()
[00:48:11] <theBrettman> what do u mean it's not working, Ortund
[00:49:11] <Ortund> theBrettman it's supposed to add height to everything so that content doesn't disappear into the background of the site, but it's not
[00:51:21] <theBrettman> not sure what u mean. I need some kind of example
[00:53:01] <Ortund> theBrettman can you not see the content on the left column is running past the bottom edge of it's container?
[00:53:50] <ruckus_> this what I have: http://jsbin.com/eqobaq/edit#javascript,html
[00:54:09] <theBrettman> nope, maybe it's cuz I'm in chrome?
[00:54:24] <ruckus_> however, the height of the id content can change on my site
[00:54:36] <ruckus_> If I click the page I get the correct height
[00:55:06] <ruckus_> but if I click the page again I get a bigger height
[00:55:40] <umren> any idea how to do something like this "var rnd = $.load('ajax.php');"
[00:55:50] <Ortund> theBrettman I'm also in Chrome... what self respecting developer uses anything else?
[00:55:56] <ruckus_> doesn't make any sense. I think I'm suppose to wait for something load? The div content contains text and images and that's it
[00:56:19] <JKarsrud> umren: var rnd; $.load('ajax.php', function(data) { rnd = data; });
[00:56:30] <JKarsrud> you need to assign the variable in the callback
[00:56:56] <JKarsrud> also, $.load is not a function
[00:57:04] <theBrettman> I only see text
[00:57:13] <JKarsrud> you could do a simple $.ajax() tho
[00:57:35] <theBrettman> and that's not a very good example, lol
[00:57:56] <ruckus_> theBrettman: well on my site there are text and images
[00:58:13] <ruckus_> theBrettman: I know but I don't know how to show it any other way
[00:58:21] <umren> JKarsrud it return undefined
[00:58:30] <ruckus_> I don't even know why I'm having the problem
[00:58:31] <mindis|wurk> instead of $.load, look up $.get
[00:58:33] <theBrettman> what's the site then?
[01:03:11] <ruckus_> theBrettman: http://homicidalrabbit.com/about
[01:11:05] <rahmen> Hi! I'm adding a table with jquery and I want to know what you think of this code: http://pastebin.com/gLS01vv7 What other ways of doing this do you know? I want a way that is easy to understand and has good performance. Thanks!
[01:12:54] <Myx0x3> i got this .ajax(), how do i prevent it to be overflooded as it "runs" every keydown?
[01:13:21] <xec_> Myx0x3: this might help you http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[01:13:26] <noname8> any opera users online?
[01:13:49] <xec_> how would you use opera offline? ;D
[01:14:11] <noname8> you might be online but not an opera user ;)
[01:14:23] <noname8> u go to sleep and then wake up dead
[01:14:51] <xec_> i doubt you can wake up if you're dead, unless your name is jesus or something
[01:15:37] <noname8> iwas refering to Scary movie :D
[01:16:07] <Gozzy> plenty of people recover from beeing clinically dead every year though..
[01:16:27] <xec_> Gozzy: yeah, but they aren't dead when they wake up ;)
[01:17:24] <Gozzy> wonderful semantics :)
[01:18:32] <noname8> lol
[01:18:53] <xec_> noname8: haha, found it, hilarious http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNuFl-Uu1go
[01:22:10] <Cork> man this ddos is starting to get on my nerv
[01:30:49] <rahmen> So... noone had any thoughts of the 8 lines of code I pasted? Should I take it as it's a good solution?
[01:30:49] <noname8> xec_ that
[01:30:49] <noname8> 's it! :D
[01:31:39] <Ortund> theBrettman, turns out it was a float containment issue... I fixed it now
[01:32:56] <xec_> rahmen: if you create dom elements instead of a html string you don't have to worry about missing tags like </table>
[01:33:27] <mindis|wurk> which he IS missing ;P
[01:33:39] <xec_> exactly :)
[01:34:24] <mindis|wurk> and i guess one could argue that $.each is theoretically slower than a 'regular' js loop but psh
[01:34:40] <xec_> rahmen: on the other hand, your data structure is a set of key/values, not really a table - a definition list might be better, but this is just semantics of course
[01:35:25] <xec_> mindis|wurk: is there an easy crossbrowser way to loop through object keys?
[01:35:27] <mindis|wurk> if a script is fast enough to run without problems on modern browsers, it's good enough. if it causes IE6 to hang, that's just a bonus >;)
[01:35:34] <xec_> mindis|wurk: natively, that is
[01:37:39] <theBrettman> if I use PUT and DELETE (and my browser supports them) does that make them a variable I can use in php like $_GET and $_POST? maybe $_PUT and $_DELETE?
[01:37:52] <Cork> no
[01:37:53] <Shambat> I am making a page that displays graphs with data from a web service in JSON format. What is the best way to make a page that only has one html file, and loads and changes what graphs are shown using only JS?
[01:38:17] <Cork> theBrettman: all browsers support them, its just test in the http connection line
[01:38:33] <Cork> DELETE <url> or PUT <url>
[01:38:50] <Cork> (instead of the normal POST <url> or GET <url>
[01:38:51] <Cork> )
[01:39:04] <mindis|wurk> Shambat no php or similar to generate the graphics? good luck :P
[01:39:12] <Cork> opps s/its just test/its just text/
[01:39:46] <Shambat> mindis|wurk: I'm using flot to create the graphs
[01:42:03] <theBrettman> ok but what I'm saying is I want to be able to do all actions in one file without setting a variable for it... so if I can see if a variable is set like get and post except for put and delete, then that would be awsesome and make my life easier
[01:44:17] <theBrettman> nvm, it's a php thing I guess
[02:11:28] <Myx0x3> how come script dont work on content from .ajax()?
[02:12:17] <mindis|wurk> probably because your events were defined before the content existed
[02:12:49] <Xotix> Does someone know jScrollPane here?
[02:13:06] <boobo> put the click-event-stuff inside the ajax callback
[02:13:16] <boobo> or whatever-event-stuff
[02:13:45] <boobo> or use .live()
[02:14:35] <Hooloovoork> not sure why but using .live always feels wrong to me =P
[02:14:54] <mindis|wurk> that's because you're not supposed to use it any more
[02:15:41] <Hooloovoork> i feel a bit more complete now that i know it wasn't just me that thought it was wrong.
[02:16:24] <mindis|wurk> yeah, well, it was pretty clearly said in the blog posts when 1.7 came out
[02:16:30] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[02:16:34] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[02:16:38] <Xotix> I need help on the most basic initialisation of jScrollPane, i don't get it. Can someone give me an example? (i know theres a page)
[02:16:39] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on in 1.7+
[02:28:49] <aro> is there a plugin that lets you have a vertical divider between say a content frame and a nav bar, and allows you to adjust the size of the two? (like drag it right to increase size of nav bar, decrease size of content frame)
[02:31:18] <Xotix> where cna i get a list of the names for overwriting the browsers active selection?
[02:31:46] <aro> i guess the functionality i am looking for is what it would be like between two frames
[02:32:34] <Kambfhase> aro: jQ UI has a resizable widget
[02:32:45] <aro> i looked at that, thats not wha ti want
[02:33:20] <aro> im talking about two divs next to eachother, one with a 20% width, the other with 80%. When you drag the divider, it adjusts the size of the two so that the sum is still 100%
[02:33:21] <aro> see?
[02:36:38] <Eviltwin> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/
[02:37:04] <aro> yes
[02:37:05] <aro> like that
[02:37:11] <aro> but let you drag between the red and blue
[02:37:11] <Eviltwin> This is a better question for #css
[02:37:24] <Eviltwin> Oh, seriously? :/
[02:37:27] <aro> i have the css done already, i dont need css
[02:37:41] <aro> or even better - consider the drag bars between the jsfiddle boxes
[02:38:07] <aro> this is definitely NOT a CSS question :)
[02:39:27] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/1/
[02:39:28] <mindis|wurk> while i don't know of a plugin for that, i think that should be quite doable with modern browsers with jqueryui's draggable
[02:40:24] <aro> there isnt a way to drag and create the width?
[02:40:34] <aro> that would be the bees knees
[02:41:16] <Eviltwin> ?
[02:41:31] <aro> id like a way to drag and adjust the size that way
[02:41:44] <Xotix> You can use a slider and a little algo maybe?
[02:41:44] <Eviltwin> You're completely helpless, aren't you?
[02:42:39] <mindis|wurk> i'd use draggable with axis limitation on a dummy element and calculate the percentages while dragging the dummy
[02:44:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/2/
[02:44:39] <aro> pretty much
[02:44:42] <Kasreyn> anyone know why jsfiddle breaks on save or how to avoid it? Result window shows nothing but "Error 404"
[02:45:05] <aro> eviltwin: i love you
[02:45:14] <aro> can i have your babies?
[02:45:17] <Kasreyn> i mean, i can't view that link you just sent
[02:45:27] <Eviltwin> aro: You can show my how much you love me right here, actually: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[02:45:40] <aro> so is that a no to the babies?
[02:45:44] <Eviltwin> Correct
[02:45:50] <nFFF> Lol
[02:45:58] <nFFF> Eviltwin has anyone donated? :D
[02:46:04] <Eviltwin> See for yourself
[02:46:25] <aro> you are trying to raise $1M?
[02:46:33] <Eviltwin> It wanted a goal
[02:46:43] <aro> well shoot for the stars i guess
[02:46:47] <nFFF> Do you have a job
[02:46:49] <overbythere> So Eviltwin, being the evil twin he is, set it at a modest value
[02:47:33] <mindis|wurk> that's quite a few dollars already :P
[02:47:52] <overbythere> if he doesn't help, does he pay back?
[02:48:08] <Eviltwin> I've yet to run into that problem
[02:48:13] <overbythere> ;)
[02:48:14] <overbythere> smooth
[02:48:26] <Eviltwin> Although someone (muzone) promised me $50 in exchange for helping him
[02:48:34] <Eviltwin> And that was like 5+ weeks ago
[02:48:45] <overbythere> takes a while to get those sort of funds up these days
[02:49:16] <mordof> overbythere: i think i vaguely get what you're talking about from entering - i've run into a project where i've had to do that before
[02:49:26] <mordof> overbythere: and have given money back to a client upon not being able to complete something
[02:49:38] <overbythere> ouch
[02:49:48] <mordof> sucks, only had to do it once
[02:50:04] <overbythere> i think we have something in our agreements about that..should really look into i
[02:50:05] <overbythere> t
[02:50:15] <overbythere> or should I focus my time on making sure it doesn't happen? idk
[02:50:27] <mordof> overbythere: what is the dilema? i came in right before you asked that last part
[02:51:05] <mordof> sounds like you're struggling to meet a deadline that you've set for yourself?
[02:51:08] <overbythere> mordof: no dilemma :) you came in at an odd moment mordof  ;)
[02:51:13] <mordof> ah, ok, lol
[02:51:27] <overbythere> mordof: http://cl.ly/E4Oy
[02:51:33] <aro> andrew eh
[02:51:52] <aro> is that zich like zick or zit
[02:52:16] <mordof> lol
[02:52:25] <mordof> overbythere: that
[02:52:38] <mordof> bleh, that's some nice fonts/coloring - client?
[02:52:46] <aro> i have sent you a pledge eviltwin
[02:53:02] <mordof> though the actual color scheme i'm not a huge fan of - would be nice to be able to change that though
[02:53:08] <aro> i feel like a better person knowing that i have been able to fund your food/porn/development/whatever fund
[02:53:16] <mordof> lol
[02:53:24] <Eviltwin> Ha ha
[02:53:28] <Eviltwin> I believe it was "beer" originally
[02:53:33] <mordof> hey so - i actually came in here with a question xD lol
[02:53:48] <mordof> er, right.. nevermind, solved it myself after i got distracted with the convo, hah! i'm all over the place now
[02:53:51] <mordof> overbythere: i blame you xD
[02:58:16] <Acriax> Hi, I've got a quick question regarding loading jquery from a CDN. I'm loading it from google at the moment. Could I use the Microsoft CDN as a fallback if google for example should be blocked?
[02:58:45] <Acriax> All guides on jquery fallbacks that I've seen only cover using one CDN and one local fallback
[02:59:04] <Trisox> could someone please ask chuck norris to close the refridgerator?
[02:59:16] <mordof> Trisox: wha?
[02:59:28] <Trisox> :D its cold outside
[02:59:32] <mordof> lol
[02:59:34] <mordof> it's warm here
[02:59:38] <aro> eviltwin: can you apply this same practice to a 'drag bar' that is absolutely positoined relative to one of the 'resizeable' panes?
[02:59:44] <Trisox> -8 here
[02:59:46] <aro> its 12° out here

[03:00:16] <mordof> brr? lol!
[03:00:17] <aro> im just trying to figure out why its not dragging now
[03:00:24] <mindis|wurk> it was probably -28c when i came to work
[03:00:29] <Trisox> bah
[03:00:29] <mordof> Trisox: where do you live that you call -20 cold!? lol
[03:00:40] <mordof> makes me giggle

[03:01:20] <aro> the great white north aint that cold
[03:01:20] <overbythere> o.o
[03:01:23] <aro> srsly?
[03:01:25] <aro> im in detroit
[03:01:26] <mordof> yeah
[03:01:35] <mordof> aro: i'm about 8 and a half hours from you, lol
[03:01:39] <mordof> from the detroit border anyway
[03:01:43] <Trisox> the ghost city of detroit
[03:01:55] <aro> detroits comin back
[03:02:02] <aro> im going downtown detroit tonight for a concert
[03:02:03] <mordof> yeah, everyone is leaving windsor - that's why
[03:02:05] <mordof> lolz
[03:02:16] <Trisox> aro: eminem?
[03:02:18] <Trisox> :P
[03:02:18] <aro> at least detroits garbage men never went on strike

[03:03:19] <mordof> i lived about 6 blocks from the water though - between detroit and windsor
[03:03:37] <mordof> right near the bar stretches, basically, lol
[03:04:01] <mordof> i can't remember the other road that crosses oulette near where i lived..
[03:04:02] <mordof> rawr
[03:04:27] <aro> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/3/ its a clunky version of what i have
[03:04:42] <aro> for some reason the drag is a bit funkalicious
[03:04:54] <aro> road that crosses oulette?
[03:05:22] <mordof> st charles ave?
[03:05:36] <overbythere> wow, nice funkiness aro
[03:05:57] <aro> i was thinking of huron church
[03:06:00] <mordof> aro: i lived where the old "downtown" used to be
[03:06:11] <Eviltwin> aro: You have two different elements with id "content"
[03:06:27] <aro> really? sweet i kick ass

[03:07:28] <mordof> iszak: what?
[03:07:28] <iszak> Is there a jQuery UK channel? I'm in the conference, want to talk to other conferencees
[03:07:34] <uchuff> ah
[03:07:36] <aro> erm
[03:07:42] <aro> why dont you go talk in person
[03:07:44] <aro> #loser
[03:07:46] <iszak> there's a talk on.
[03:07:47] <uchuff> lol
[03:07:48] <mordof> o.o
[03:07:49] <Kambfhase> if jQuery were britith, ...
[03:07:50] <iszak> haha
[03:07:54] <uchuff> there's probably a hashtafg
[03:07:56] <overbythere> britith?
[03:07:56] <uchuff> on twitter
[03:08:01] <iszak> £('#id') if it were british.
[03:08:02] <Kambfhase> +s
[03:08:02] <uchuff> doubt there would be an irc channel
[03:08:05] <aro> i am british
[03:08:09] <overbythere> iszak++
[03:08:12] <iszak> there is, #jquk
[03:08:16] <iszak> but I wanted an IRC channel :(
[03:08:24] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/7/ - i changed the id but its still acting odd
[03:08:28] <uchuff> i'm just jealous that you're there and i'm not
[03:08:30] <Kambfhase> aro: i feel sorry for yoou.
[03:08:32] <uchuff> can u live stream it for us
[03:08:42] <aro> sorry
[03:08:44] <mordof> lol xD
[03:08:44] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/XypRU/8
[03:08:55] <aro> Kambfhase: why? cuz i was born in UK?
[03:08:56] <iszak> my macbook air doesn't have a backwards camera, but I could.
[03:09:01] <mordof> aro: whoa! that's odd!
[03:09:02] <iszak> I won a blackberry playbook :D
[03:09:08] <uchuff> unlucky
[03:09:18] <iszak> I think 1/3 of people won it.
[03:09:20] <uchuff> actually i wouldn't mind one to rest my iPad on
[03:09:29] <aro> nevermind i got it
[03:09:31] <iszak> apparently the version 2 is going to be better.
[03:09:42] <mordof> aro: what was it?
[03:09:56] <aro> i was sizing the frame content and not content-panel
[03:10:03] <aro> but it still doenst work on my server.. odd
[03:10:14] <fof> €('#id')*
[03:11:52] <mordof> aro: funny how that goes
[03:13:29] <aro> whoa
[03:13:32] <aro> there was a weird character
[03:13:48] <mordof> ?
[03:15:15] <aro> i dunno some invisible character that showed in my source but not my ide
[03:15:40] <mordof> odd, can't say i haven't had it happen before though
[03:16:59] <mordof> :\
[03:17:06] <mordof> disappointed that textual isn't for other OS's
[03:18:24] <mordof> although i suppose it doesn't matter, i'm used to irssi
[03:18:35] <mordof> it'd just be a small step up in eye candy, lol
[03:21:50] <aro> ok it works now
[03:21:52] <aro> thanks ET!
[03:22:01] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[03:22:34] <aro> hey mordof
[03:22:38] <aro> do you remember sandwich pkwy
[03:23:09] <mordof> aro: i didn't live there long enough to really know anything well
[03:23:17] <aro> what did you live there for
[03:23:25] <aro> how long were you there
[03:23:28] <mordof> moved there for 2 reasons
[03:23:38] <mordof> a) to get away from my parents, b) girl i liked lived there
[03:23:44] <aro> theres your mistake
[03:23:51] <mordof> yep :p
[03:23:57] <aro> canadian girls are insane
[03:23:57] <mordof> that was a while back, lol
[03:24:26] * mordof shrugs
[03:24:41] <aro> most girls are insane
[03:24:47] <aro> except me
[03:24:53] <aro> but ive had my moments
[03:24:55] <aro> so who knows
[03:25:06] <mordof> lol
[03:25:41] <mordof> aro: didn't you know? it's dangerous to admit you're a girl on the internet XD
[03:26:06] <mordof> hehe, i always find that funny
[03:26:13] <aro> eh most people know i am
[03:26:55] <Eviltwin> You write your jQuery with bubbly letters
[03:26:55] <mordof> aro: yeah, i don't buy it - i just find it humerous enough when other people say it that i repeat it just to make myself giggle
[03:27:21] <hdnine> Please help with a jQuery question regarding binding events with ".on()" and ".off()". The problem text/question is specified at Pastebin http://pastebin.com/Jsgpkjw0
[03:27:56] <mordof> hdnine: on and off are for specifying bubbling targets
[03:28:10] <mordof> hdnine: you haven't done so with .off
[03:28:15] <mordof> or with on for that matter
[03:28:17] <mordof> wha...
[03:28:25] <mordof> why are you using on and off!?
[03:29:05] <hdnine> ok, i'm trying to simulate the JS addeventlistener function
[03:29:11] <hdnine> should i use live or bind then?
[03:29:34] <mordof> hdnine: why not .mousemove?
[03:29:43] <Kambfhase> live, or .delegate or on with a selector
[03:29:47] <mordof> it's on the *document* of all things
[03:30:09] <mordof> live is deprecated, don't use it
[03:30:17] <mordof> but you're placing it on the *document*, use .mousemove
[03:30:19] <Eviltwin> hdnine: What about this? http://pastebin.com/Nz29Nb03
[03:30:25] <hdnine> right... kinda new to jquery, trying to understand the syntax
[03:30:47] <mordof> Eviltwin: i like it
[03:31:11] <Kasreyn> is the inconsistent behavior of regex a kommonly known "pecularity" ?  testcase here: http://jsfiddle.net/Kasreyn/QCJP5/
[03:31:15] <Eviltwin> Constantly adding and removing event listeners is usually more expensive than leaving them on
[03:31:35] <hdnine> Kas: Looks better than my crap =)
[03:32:22] <mordof> Kasreyn: why not use strpos?
[03:32:24] <hdnine> Evil, oh really? Just learning new stuff every day =)
[03:33:00] <mordof> er
[03:33:05] <mordof> wait, strpos is php i think, lol
[03:33:18] <mordof> i always get string functions mixed up between the two xD
[03:33:34] <Eviltwin> Doesn't sound JavaScripty to me
[03:33:47] <hdnine> Thanks... i'll try to make some changes
[03:34:20] <mordof> the js version of strpos would be .indexOf
[03:35:08] <uchuff> glad its not just me that does that mordof
[03:35:15] <mordof> uchuff: haha
[03:35:28] <mordof> uchuff: i'm always using google to figure out "ok, what's the JS version of this function!? heh"
[03:35:51] <tra> hmmm how can i "break" out of a $.each() loop?
[03:36:05] <Eviltwin> return false
[03:36:07] <Kambfhase> return false; i think
[03:36:23] <tra> yep looks like it. thanks :)
[03:36:31] <mordof> hm, interesting
[04:15:34] <Nomikos> How do I make a div disappear on a keyboard event, if the div can't have focus?
[04:16:09] <mindis|wurk> nothing prevents you from binding keyboard events elsewhere in your document
[04:16:13] <Kambfhase> $(document).keypress(function(){ $('div').hide() })
[04:16:51] <Nomikos> but will that code then not be evaluated for *every* keypress?
[04:17:04] <Nomikos> it seems a bit overkill, somehow
[04:17:19] <Kambfhase> yes, so you gotta restrict it to rthe keypress you want
[04:18:32] <mordof> is it acceptable to call .each() on an expected single element to isolate code that should only run if something exists?
[04:18:33] <Nomikos> hm-mm, just thinking, it'll still "check" for every press, even when it's required - I guess I can start and stop watching for that event when showing/hiding the div
[04:18:54] <Nomikos> *when it's not required
[04:19:00] * Nomikos looks for his coffee
[04:19:38] <mindis|wurk> doing simple checks on key events isn't very expensive
[04:19:54] <Kambfhase> mordof: you can also do if( $('elem').length){ ... }
[04:20:49] <mordof> Kambfhase: then i still have to use the selector to grab the element, meanwhile $(this) would be faster would it not?
[04:21:45] <Kambfhase> well you have to select the elmenet anyway, havn't you?
[04:21:59] <mordof> that's what the .each takes care of
[04:22:03] <mordof> then i just use $(this)
[04:22:33] <mordof> which (guessing, i haven't confirmed) should be cheaper on process time
[04:25:32] <mordof> hrrmm
[04:32:49] <jonkri> how can i know whether an image is loaded or not? i'm not interested in the load event, but rather at any time to ask "is image x loaded"?
[04:39:29] <ravenzz> jonkri indeed you can use load http://jsfiddle.net/mfrEj/
[04:39:45] <ravenzz> it will log only the loaded ones
[04:40:07] <jonkri> ravenzz, 404
[04:40:15] <ravenzz> uh there is a typo
[04:40:15] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/mfrEj/1/
[04:40:37] <jonkri> ravenzz, same error
[04:40:45] <ravenzz> what error?
[04:41:27] <jonkri> ravenzz, 404
[04:41:39] <ravenzz> weird
[04:43:34] <Zogot> jsfiddle is down
[04:43:37] <Zogot> as they are moving servers
[04:43:40] <Zogot> its in read only mode
[04:43:55] <Zogot> try jsbin
[04:44:20] <ravenzz> yep I know, but i got a link from it
[04:44:21] <Kambfhase> i though they are done moving?
[04:44:22] <ravenzz> :\
[04:44:30] <ravenzz> me either
[04:44:39] <ravenzz> jonkri anyway http://tinkerbin.com/qkeUuaqv
[04:45:21] <ravenzz> https://twitter.com/#!/js_fiddle/status/167730360451481600
[04:45:57] <Kambfhase> yeah, if you still have problems, go file a ticket
[04:46:13] <ravenzz> I don't have problems
[04:46:22] <ravenzz> the link is working for me
[04:46:46] <ravenzz> do you guys get a 404 http://jsfiddle.net/mfrEj/1/
[04:46:46] <ravenzz> ?
[04:46:59] <Kambfhase> works fine
[04:47:12] <pawel__> when i try this in my console it works $("#mytaglist").tagit("tags").map(function(){ return this.value; }) but when I append it with .join(", ") it gives me a typerror saying it's not a function. Why?
[04:47:16] <ravenzz> boh
[04:48:01] <Kambfhase> pawel__: a jQ-array is not a normal array
[04:48:20] <Kambfhase> to get a JS-array first call .get()
[04:48:45] <mordof> wait what, how is the array result that jq returns not a normal array?
[04:48:46] <ravenzz> mh isn't it an object collection?
[04:48:58] <mordof> ah
[04:48:59] <mordof> right, those
[04:49:24] <pawel__> anyone?
[04:49:24] <Kambfhase> it looks like an array and behaves like one, but its not.
[04:49:46] <Kambfhase> wtf?
[04:50:05] <ravenzz> what is tagit ?
[04:50:11] <mordof> Kambfhase: .. .get is for ajax requests
[04:50:33] <mordof> Kambfhase: as far as i can tell that response makes no sense
[04:50:33] <ravenzz> ah k
[04:50:51] <pawel__> Disconnected so trying again. When i try this in my console it works $("#mytaglist").tagit("tags").map(function(){ return this.value; }) but when I append it with .join(", ") it gives me a typerror saying it's not a function. Why?
[04:50:55] <Kambfhase> mordof: "as far as i can tell" << thats the problem ;)
[04:50:57] <ravenzz> pawel__ i don't know what tagit returns
[04:51:06] <ravenzz> does it return an array of tags?
[04:51:08] <mordof> Kambfhase: i added that because if it DOES make sense, I'd like some elaboration so i understand it :)
[04:51:27] <Kambfhase> pawel__: try $("#mytaglist").tagit("tags").map(function(){ return this.value; }).get().join()
[04:51:27] <jonkri> ravenzz, the image is not available when the page is loaded. what i want is this: if(is_loaded(IMAGE)) {}
[04:51:27] <pawel__> ravenzz yeah it returns an array of strings
[04:52:03] <ravenzz> jonkri well, you can create an array with the images and subtract the loaded ones!
[04:52:15] <pawel__> jambfhase that works. thanks! what does the get() do in this example?
[04:52:16] <ravenzz> so you'll have the not loaded ones
[04:52:35] <ravenzz> subtract (?) lol, remove :)
[04:52:43] <fof> this looks like a good beginner tutorial for jQ + JSON if anyone's interested: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/09/beginners-guide-jquery-based-json-api-clients/
[04:52:46] <Kambfhase> it makes a normal array outof your jQuery array.
[04:52:59] <mordof> Kambfhase: .map already returns an array
[04:53:12] <ravenzz> well depends on what is the input iirc
[04:53:19] <ravenzz> mordof ^
[04:53:21] <pawel__> thanks dude
[04:53:29] <mordof> ravenzz: but he's adding .get ON TOP OF the .map
[04:53:29] <Kambfhase> mordof: negativ: As the return value is a jQuery-wrapped array, it's very common to get() the returned object to work with a basic array.
[04:53:38] <Kambfhase> mordof: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[04:53:44] <ravenzz> mordof oh k I miss that
[04:53:48] <mordof> c
[04:53:51] <mordof> gr
[04:54:02] <mordof> "Description: Translate all items in an array or object to a new array of items."
[04:54:08] <mordof> from that exact link
[04:54:43] <mordof> .map is meant to iterate over a collection or set and return an array results
[04:54:58] <mordof> it makes *no sense* to throw an ajax call of all things on top of it with empty params
[04:55:02] <Kambfhase> you are looking at the wrong .map() method ;)
[04:55:18] <_bart> (jQuery mobile) I have loaded the navbar with ajax and called .navbar(); but now the navbar is styled but now the buttons are vertically aligned instead of horizontally: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/ it should be horizontal like usual!
[04:55:29] <jonkri> ravenzz, that's an idea, thanks
[04:55:34] <mordof> hmm
[04:55:54] <mordof> wow, even the docs do that..
[04:55:55] <mordof> pfft
[04:56:02] <mordof> my respect for jquery just dropped about 40 points
[04:56:07] <ravenzz> jonkri you're welcome
[04:56:54] <mordof> can't they use something other than an intended ajax call to change over from an object set to an array -.-;;; geez
[04:57:01] <_bart> I have loaded the navbar with ajax and called .navbar(); but now the navbar is styled but now the buttons are vertically aligned instead of horizontally: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/ it should be horizontal like usual! I'm also unable to catch the click events, even with .live()
[04:57:51] <Kambfhase> .get() is ok, but .load() fucks up pretty easily
[04:58:02] <mordof> unless there's multiple .get's too
[04:58:02] <fof> bart how did you solve your .trigger("create") problem? typo somewhere?
[04:58:19] <mordof> BAH THERE IS!!!
[04:58:49] <mordof> Kambfhase: alright, so the fact that there's duplicates of methods for different instances.. well, that pisses me off.. but it makes more sense with the actual ones it's using
[05:01:34] <Logikos_> hi, i'm mostly new to javascript and jquery, however i've tryed to make a simple little script and its not behaving as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/NEHv3/2/
[05:01:55] <Logikos_> when you first run that, it executes slidebox('-')
[05:02:11] <Logikos_> rather than just telling it to execute it on click .... of the right arrow
[05:02:21] <mordof> Logikos_: that's because you need to put the slidebox('-') in a function
[05:02:23] <Kambfhase> yeah, you are doint it wrong
[05:02:31] <_bart> fof: nope, trigger("create") is used for content, .navbar(); is for navbars..
[05:02:44] <_bart> fof: the documentation of jquery mobile is a nightmare
[05:02:54] <Nomikos> Logikos_: $('.slideright').click(slidebox('-')); --> $('.slideright').click(function() ..etc
[05:03:05] <_bart> fof: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/javascripts/notevote.js
[05:03:17] <fof> i mean yesterday you couldnt get stuff styled after getting it with ajax
[05:03:31] <Nomikos> Logikos_: reason is, slidebox('-') is called regardless of click in your way, to supply click() with a function
[05:03:36] <Nomikos> or value
[05:04:06] <mordof> mhmm
[05:04:08] <Logikos_> thanks to those who replyed, i had it defined as an embeded function before
[05:04:21] <Logikos_> i'm trying to make a seperate external function which it calls on click
[05:04:23] <_bart> fof: yes, now you see it styled!
[05:04:29] <Logikos_> so that i can preform these actions from other bits of code also
[05:04:32] <_bart> fof: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/
[05:04:33] <Logikos_> to avoid redundant code
[05:04:57] <Logikos_> is there no way in jquery to have it execute a named function on click?
[05:05:04] <_bart> fof: but I'm unable to catch the click events of the navbar links and get the last bit of styling of the navbar right.
[05:05:09] <mordof> Logikos_: .click(function(){  });
[05:05:12] <mordof> Logikos_: like has been shown
[05:05:13] <_bart> fof: please help me out.
[05:05:19] <Nomikos> click(foobar) will run foobar() on click
[05:05:21] <mordof> Logikos_: oh, NAMED
[05:05:26] <mordof> yeah
[05:05:46] <Logikos_> yes i get that you can embed a function there, but what about useing a named function ?
[05:05:52] <mordof> i really shouldn't pull all-nighters anymore xD lol
[05:06:03] <Nomikos> Logikos_: click(foobar) will run foobar() on click
[05:06:20] <Nomikos> Logikos_: if you give the function name without (), it won't run immediately
[05:06:41] <Nomikos> but the click handler will now run it when it's triggered
[05:06:48] <Logikos_> Nomikos: so you can execute a named function only if you do not pass arguments?
[05:06:49] <Nomikos> s/it's/the event is/
[05:07:09] <Nomikos> Logikos_: and for /that/ you can use the function() {} wrapper method again :)
[05:07:18] <_bart> Alright, I'll create a new question on stackoverflow..
[05:07:31] <Logikos_> function() { namedfunction(args); }; ?
[05:07:32] <Logikos_> lol
[05:07:34] <mordof> _bart: for?
[05:07:35] <Nomikos> yep
[05:07:38] <mordof> _bart: i didn't see the question
[05:07:39] <Logikos_> k, thanks
[05:08:08] <Nomikos> It seems a bit verbose, true, but .. eh, JS isn't perfect
[05:08:33] <mordof> hmm
[05:08:47] <Kambfhase> Js doesnt have partial application.
[05:10:13] <mordof> _bart: ooiii!
[05:10:41] <_bart>  mordof: I have loaded the navbar with ajax and called .navbar(); but now the navbar is styled but now the buttons are vertically aligned instead of horizontally: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/ it should be horizontal like usual! I'm also unable to catch the click events, even with .live()
[05:11:44] <mordof> _bart: the bottom nav items?
[05:12:06] <_bart> mordof: yes, that's a navbar
[05:12:09] <mordof> _bart: there's absolutely no styling to make them horizontal for one
[05:12:25] <mordof> _bart: block elements are max width by default
[05:12:32] <_bart> mordof: If I set the navbar statically they get horizontal
[05:12:39] <_bart> mordof: jquery mobile does that!
[05:12:48] <mordof> _bart: o.O
[05:12:53] <fof> arent you attaching handlers to the click event before actually loading the navbar?
[05:12:56] <_bart> mordof: and I expected the method .navbar(); to do the styling, and it did, but only partially.
[05:13:09] <_bart> fof: it's .live(); that should work right?
[05:13:36] <_bart> fof: because the menu items change constantly
[05:13:51] <fof> i see, dont have experience with live
[05:13:56] <fof> though though ti was deprecated
[05:13:58] <mordof> .live is deprecated
[05:14:00] <xec_> it is
[05:14:00] <mordof> yep
[05:14:07] <_bart> what's the new thing?
[05:14:08] <Shambat> has anyone here used the flot plugin? I'm getting some strange bug that draws the graph area too large in some cases so that the tickLabels are drawn on top of the graph. This happens when I reach the page through a link on the same site, but works fine when I go to that page directly... are there some pitfalls about this linking I should cosnider?
[05:14:12] <fof> on i think
[05:14:20] <mordof> on or delegate, mhmm
[05:14:43] <xec_> .on() is all you need. nananananaaa
[05:15:05] <James13433> Hi Guys, when I e.preventDefault() I want to run the default when I have finished what I want to do, how can I do that?
[05:15:28] <xec_> James13433: if you want to run default , don't prevent it :P
[05:15:41] <James13433> well cant I delay it?
[05:16:03] <mordof> _bart: is there a function to completely undo the .navbar() effects?
[05:16:09] <xec_> not that i know of
[05:16:21] <James13433> I want to slide in a form #formid, then jump the page to it onece it has slidden in
[05:16:50] <James13433> if I jump the form to it first, the page hasnt got to full height and therefor, hasnt jumped to the correct place
[05:16:58] <_bart> mordof: I actually recreate the entire navbar #menu.
[05:17:05] <_bart> after removing it from DOM.
[05:17:24] <_bart> ah that's IT!
[05:17:35] <_bart> I'm applying .navbar to the ul, but that's not correct I think.
[05:17:43] <xec_> James13433: you can use scrollTo plugin for that, i believe
[05:17:44] <_bart> I need the parent, the actual navbar.
[05:17:52] <mordof> odd, but alright..
[05:18:01] <_bart> <div data-role="navbar" id="navbar">
[05:18:09] <mordof> yeah
[05:18:18] <_bart> so this explain the odd alignment but the correct styling.
[05:18:23] <_bart> explains*
[05:18:37] <nFFF> James13433, can't you use .delay()
[05:18:40] <mordof> i don't know if i'd say it explains it, lol
[05:19:06] <James13433> nFFf but how do you delay the default?
[05:20:20] <nFFF> prevent it, delay then run again?
[05:20:35] <xec_> nFFF: but how do you trigger the default action
[05:20:42] <James13433> exactly :/
[05:20:48] <_bart> that fixed it: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/
[05:20:54] <Kambfhase> trigger and do not prevemt
[05:21:33] <iateadonut> if type='CC' and id='5', and i have <table id='CC5'>...<input id='nameOnCard'>, why doesn't    alert ( $('#'+type+id+' > #nameOnCard').val() );    alert the contents of that input text?
[05:21:34] <_bart> but .on(); behaves differently from .live()
[05:22:02] <mordof> _bart: it's supposed to, that's why .live is delegated
[05:22:11] <mordof> er
[05:22:13] <mordof> deprecated
[05:22:35] <hdnine> Need som help againg with a drag event. Explaination is in the text http://pastebin.com/n5MpsAxh
[05:22:44] <nFFF> James13433
[05:22:46] <nFFF> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1238477/suspend-default-event-in-jquery
[05:22:57] <xec_> _bart: you can make .on() do exactly the same as .live()
[05:22:59] <nFFF> setTimeout not delay
[05:23:03] <nFFF> is what you need
[05:23:18] <Kambfhase> ?p @ iateadonut
[05:23:19] <bot-t> iateadonut, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:23:28] <_bart> xec_: the big blue button worked with .live but doesn't with .on: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/
[05:23:52] <xec_> _bart: $('div').live('click', func...) is the same as $(document).on('click', 'div', func...) i believe
[05:24:16] <_bart> xec_: ah that's quite different
[05:25:11] <_bart> xec_: it works :D
[05:25:12] <_bart> woooo
[05:25:24] <James13433> thanks guys fixed it window.location = #location;
[05:25:25] <mordof> you could also do $("#content").on('click', '#authenticate', func...)
[05:25:29] <mordof> so that it's accurate
[05:25:51] <mordof> hopefully it translates
[05:25:51] <mordof> heh
[05:25:57] * mordof shrugs
[05:26:31] <xec_> _bart: you should read up on the differences between .live() .delegate() and .bind()
[05:26:41] <xec_> _bart: the new .on() syntax supercedes all of these
[05:27:26] <xec_> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:28:02] <xec_> it's a long page, but very useful ;)
[05:28:13] <jonkri> is there some way i can execute code when a certain element becomes visible?
[05:28:55] <xec_> jonkri: is it your own script that makes said element visible?
[05:29:13] <_bart> xec_: $("#footer").on('click', ".regular-menu", touchMenuItem); doesn't work.
[05:30:12] <hdnine> Could use some help with a drag event problem. Explaination is in the text at http://pastebin.com/n5MpsAxh. Thanks!
[05:30:37] <_bart> xec_: http://bartlab.nl/test/www/ clicks on .general-menu should be catched
[05:32:48] <jonkri> xec_, yes, but i don't think i can use a trigger. it's complex php/javascript mess :P i will think it over :)
[05:33:27] <iateadonut> $('div#tester').innerHTML = 'hello';   -  does jsfiddle work like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/edqxs/
[05:34:51] <Lobosque> is there a way to trigger an event when the content of an element changes? Like the 'change' event, but for the content of a div, for example.
[05:35:58] <Kambfhase> ?html @ iateadonut
[05:35:59] <bot-t> iateadonut, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:39:58] <_bart> <li><a href="#">something</a><li>  let's say $(this) is the <li>, how do I select the a?
[05:40:10] <_bart> $(this).$("a") is obviously wrong
[05:40:39] <Zogot> $(this).find("a")
[05:40:41] <Zogot> should do it
[05:40:46] <Zogot> but im sure theres a better way
[05:41:35] <Zogot> children() may be faster than find
[05:41:37] <Zogot> in this example
[05:42:56] <_bart> Just ONE simple problem left.
[05:43:36] <_bart> the <div data-role="footer" id="footer" data-position="fixed"> should move to the bottom when the content html has changed -> content height changed.
[05:44:37] <Nomikos> Anyone know how I can get the original value of a text field (what it will revert to when doing a form reset), as opposed to the current value?
[05:45:18] <nFFF> Nomikos, assign it to a var on DOM load
[05:45:19] <nFFF> ?
[05:46:05] <Nomikos> Hrm, no cleaner way? I was thinking with the new attr() vs val() vs prop() things there ought to be something
[05:46:14] <xec_> jonkri: i was thinking you could create your own custom event, is that what you meant by "trigger"?
[05:47:24] <Kambfhase> attr('value') ?
[05:48:01] <Nomikos> yeah no, that returns the unsaved value
[05:48:13] <iateadonut> http://jsfiddle.net/edqxs/3/ - how should i be forming this selector: $('#CC782615 > #nameOnCard')
[05:48:41] <xec_> Nomikos: on form fields you have defaultValue
[05:49:38] <Nomikos> xec_: aha, that is useful
[05:49:47] <greggyNapalm1> Hi all, tell me please if I have a jQuery 1.4.3 and need to use jQuery.when is there any work around for that?
[05:50:01] <Nomikos> so, now that I know that :-) is there a 'reset' event handler?
[05:50:05] <greggyNapalm1> the task is to make 2 ajax calls return one deffered object
[05:51:47] <r126f> iateadonut: do you want "$('#CC782615 #nameOnCard').val()" ?
[05:53:51] <Kambfhase> 1.4.3 does not have deferreds.
[05:54:00] <Kambfhase> you really should upgrade
[05:54:48] <iateadonut> r126f, yes, thannks.
[06:00:02] <greggyNapalm1> thx
[06:09:51] <Guest6419> hi!
[06:09:57] <bart> HI! :D
[06:10:13] <bart> how can I specify 2 items in a widget factory function ?
[06:10:20] <bart> 	(function( $ ) {
[06:10:21] <bart> 				$.widget( "ui.time_from", { ....
[06:10:31] <Guest67886> .nick bartmax
[06:10:48] <bartmax> i want to apply to ui.time_from and ui.time_to
[06:10:55] <bartmax> at the same time, same function, same everything
[06:16:33] <bartmax> ajpiano ?
[06:18:45] <bartmax> nevermind, done it
[06:18:57] <r126f> iateadonut: '>' means just child and ' '(white space) means all descendant http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:19:41] <bartmax> > inmediate child.
[06:19:43] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:17: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
[06:21:12] <anli_> Why is the function probe_for_unlocked never run in http://jsfiddle.net/xUKft/ ?
[06:22:00] <anli_> Hm, maybe I know why
[06:26:32] <hdnine> When having a drag-event in jQuery, why does it stop calculating the mouse position? I have a function that puts the mouse X and Y into the console.log but they becom NaN as soon as i start dragging?!? >.<
[06:28:35] <hdnine> Sorrym the value becomes "undefined" when i dragend
[06:28:58] <bartmax> jqueryui missing checkbox element in themes? :D
[06:30:32] <kborchers> hdnine: my guess is you're doing something wrong. this works just fine http://jsfiddle.net/VtjJL/
[06:31:40] <Lobosque> I can use $(this).click(function_name); to call a function once the click event is triggered. But how do I send arguments to this function?
[06:31:56] <Zogot> it automaticly does it
[06:32:03] <Zogot> say function(arg1, arg2)
[06:32:12] <Zogot> and you do $(this).click(function);
[06:33:23] <Lobosque> Zogot, but what if I want to send a third argument?
[06:33:44] <Kambfhase> .click( [eventData], handler(eventObject) )
[06:33:49] <Kambfhase> eventDataA map of data that will be passed to the event handler.
[06:33:53] <Zogot> aye, click only supports a few things passed
[06:33:54] <Kambfhase> from http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:33:58] <Zogot> how much more did you want?
[06:35:14] <Nomikos> Hm, can you not just stuff eventData with all the variables you want?
[06:35:31] <Nomikos> never tried, it's new to me, have to play with ..
[06:35:36] <Lobosque> Zogot, its because I can reuse this function for other things. I think it is just easier to use .click(function() { call_my_function_here(args..) });
[06:36:49] <Zogot> That could probably be the better solution.  Quick new to, I think they are called, pointers
[06:37:01] <Zogot> instead of wrapping it all in an anonymous function
[06:40:05] <jacof> How would I go about adding some values to the ajax response object ?
[06:41:18] <Zogot> Lobosque: http://jsbin.com/amesuq/3/edit#javascript,html an example of my current way of writing JS.
[06:41:27] <Zogot> You can see it in use at http://leon.rowland.nl
[06:41:56] <Lobosque> thanks Zogot, I'll take a look
[06:42:17] <niels__> I'm trying to return a string from a function, if I do alert() in the function itself it works perfectly fine, but i can't return the string value in my .each() - Am i completely missing something very basic here? http://pastebin.com/Tkuv8fAV thanks alot :)
[06:44:18] <Nomikos> niels__: it works with the alert because that takes up the time needed for the .get request to return the data, I think
[06:44:53] <Nomikos> without the alert, tjekdet will return a value before the $.get() has finished - it's this asynchronous thing
[06:45:14] <niels__> Nomikos: Okay, how would you solve that?
[06:45:26] <nFFF> is there no success:
[06:45:40] <Nomikos> niels__: I solved it by using the second answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917005/return-value-for-function-containing-jquery-post-function
[06:46:00] <Nomikos> Not sure it's the perfect way, but it fixed my issue :)
[06:47:16] <Nomikos> niels__: in your code you're running a .get request for each navn-list item - while I don't know how long that list is, might it not be more efficient to send a list of names, and get back a list of values, in one request?
[06:47:52] <Nomikos> just a suggestion :-)
[06:47:59] <nFFF> That's so fucked up if it retunrs data before the success of the request
[06:48:33] <niels__> Nomikos: I tried that, and it worked fine. But the request takes around 60 seconds, so would rather do it this way.
[06:48:50] <Nomikos> ok
[06:48:54] <niels__> Nomikos: Print out the names, and update the status one by one instead.
[06:48:57] <niels__> If that makes any sense
[06:49:00] <Nomikos> yeah
[06:49:11] <Nomikos> shows the user something is happening
[06:49:16] <niels__> exactly
[06:49:27] <niels__> trying to work my head around that stack post, but can't figure it out to be honest
[06:50:46] <Nomikos> What you do is tell jQuery to only make synchronous calls (I .. think that's the jargon..), so it waits for the request to return data before continuing on with the rest of the code
[06:51:24] <Nomikos> In your code you'd do this at the start of the live click handler. then at the end of that, you can enable asynchronous calls again
[06:51:39] <Nomikos> so you just call $.ajaxSetup({async: false});
[06:52:03] <niels__> i'll give it a go, thanks
[06:52:09] <Nomikos> .. ehr, at the start, and $.ajaxSetup({async: true}); after the each loop
[06:55:26] <jonkri> is there some converter or something that can convert a set of html to javascript objects?
[06:55:50] <jonkri> like dom objects that i can add to elements easily
[06:56:37] <CharlieM751> isn't each supposed to iterate the fields of an object? firebug tells me its an object.. I step into it, and this is still the object, not a field.. am I misunderstanding something
[06:56:57] <Nomikos> jonkri: afaik you can just stuff them inside $() and it'll become a jQuery object
[06:58:02] <Nomikos> CharlieM751: what kind of fields are they?
[06:59:46] <CharlieM751> nevermind, I was calling it incorrectly.. was trying jQuery(obj).each(...) rather than jQuery.each(obj, function() ... )
[07:02:42] <lacrymology> say I want to make a drag-and-drop system like G+ circles, I drag, drop, add to the new group, remove from the general list, and the send the POST command via AJAX to the server so it works it out in the DB... say that fails for some reason.. how would I handle it? keep the old state in memory until the response comes, and restore it? send the whole section in the response, in case of a failure? send the whole section regardless (this doesn't sound g
[07:09:04] <Nomikos> lacrymology: I'd try to keep the old state in memory and revert to that
[07:10:47] <trooney> Hey guys, how do I make a cross-domain json request w/ jquery in IE? I keep getting error.
[07:11:03] <Nomikos> so when you start dragging, store the start position or start parent element in the draggable; then on the droppable drop event, you can access ui.draggable and tell it to revert somehow, if the server returned error
[07:11:50] <Nomikos> trooney: JSONP, if the target domain supports that
[07:12:17] <trooney> Nomikos: Thanks. If it doesn't? :)
[07:12:43] <Nomikos> trooney: then you might need to revert to server-side scripting to fetch the data, and return it from your server to the client
[07:12:49] <jacof> is this about correct ? $(className).closest('div.#right_box div.product_content > h2:first-child > a').css("color","red");
[07:12:59] <jacof> or can I select just parents ?
[07:13:04] <trooney> Nomikos: Gotchya. Thx.
[07:13:34] <Nomikos> jacof: #right_box should be unique, so you might as well start there?
[07:14:04] <Nomikos> I'm not sure how closest() works with a path like that
[07:14:11] <jacof> Nomikos: it isn't :/
[07:14:20] <jacof> some genius coded it
[07:15:08] <nail__> div.# ?
[07:15:29] <tankblergh> hi people! Does anyone here know how to present binary data (memorystream) in mvc as a downloadable file?
[07:15:47] <tankblergh> no response at the #asp.net channel
[07:15:51] <tankblergh> :P
[07:16:11] <Nomikos> hrm. I think then just select the needed parent with closest(), then tack on .find() to specify the right target element (basically 'div.product_content etc')
[07:16:29] <jacof> nail__: that's the problem. thanks
[07:17:03] <AdvoWork> if im doign: $('#test').append('<tr id="' + row_count + '" class="rowb" name="price_break_row">.... '); How can i also remove all rows?
[07:17:15] <Nomikos> tankblergh: give it some binary/octet-stream MIME header?
[07:18:11] <Nomikos> AdvoWork: $('#test tr').remove();  ?
[07:18:19] <tankblergh> is this possible? <a href blablabla src="controller/method/parameter" />?
[07:18:32] <tankblergh> with the type specified
[07:18:36] <Nomikos> AdvoWork: or do you mean just remove the rows that you added?
[07:18:50] <Nomikos> tankblergh: ehrm, I highly doubt it.
[07:18:58] <Nomikos> tankblergh: oh, wait
[07:19:07] <karstenk1977_> Please could you tell me, why I get this error in firebug console : http://www.hotshotsessen.de/news/blog-post/2012/03/02/davis-cup-open-beim-pbc-olympic/
[07:19:29] <karstenk1977_> TagCanvas is in header and jQuery above
[07:19:36] <Nomikos> tankblergh: you do have to set that httpheader serverside, but you can do that based on some parameter in the url. other than that, I know nothing about ASP
[07:19:57] <karstenk1977_> said tagcanvas isn´t a function, isn´t it?
[07:20:02] <tankblergh> ok, thanks for the reply
[07:20:58] <Nomikos> karstenk1977_: your tagcanvas plugin isn't loading
[07:21:15] <karstenk1977_> ?
[07:21:20] <karstenk1977_> its in header
[07:21:35] <Nomikos> karstenk1977_: yeah, but it's a relative path, needs a / in front
[07:22:08] <Nomikos> karstenk1977_: the browser is trying to find it relative to news/blog-post/2012/03/02/davis-cup-open-beim-pbc-olympic/ right now
[07:24:00] <Nomikos> karstenk1977_: <script src="/typo3conf/etc instead of <script src="typo3conf/etc, make sense?
[07:24:16] <karstenk1977_> mh
[07:25:51] <jacof> Can anyone spot a problem in this one ? $(className).closest('div.right_timer_content').siblings('div.product_content').children('h2 > a').css("color","red");
[07:25:51] <Nomikos> Goes for a bunch of other resources there as well, in FF you can click on the src uri when viewing source, and it loads the resulting 404
[07:27:54] <Nomikos> I think the selector in children() will only match immediate descendants
[07:28:17] <Nomikos> replace children( with find( , does that work?
[07:28:37] <jacof> let me
[07:29:04] <Logikos_> in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/NEHv3/3/  ... why is this line showing an error in consol: var $kids = $(this).childern();
[07:29:06] <jacof> yep :) and no problem of it going UP the DOM tree rather than down when using .find ?
[07:29:19] <Nomikos> jacof: nope. find only goes down
[07:29:28] <jacof> great, thanks Nomikos
[07:29:45] <JSONB> Logikos_: that fiddle is a 404
[07:29:55] <nFFF> Logikos_
[07:30:02] <nFFF> $kids ?
[07:30:03] <Nomikos> Logikos_: typo: childern
[07:30:14] <Kambfhase> $kids = $(this).childern(); // when you see it, you'll shit bricks
[07:30:25] <Nomikos> $kids is a valid variable name in JS :-)
[07:30:36] <Nomikos> it's unusual, but valid
[07:30:48] <nFFF> Ah k, looks like php :D
[07:31:02] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[07:31:32] <Logikos_> i used $kids because on api.jquery.com/children/  ... they used var $kids =  in there example
[07:31:38] <Logikos_> thanks for the spelling correction :)
[07:31:39] <Logikos_> lol
[07:31:42] <jqp> when i go to http://blog.jqueryui.com my browser is saying it's an attack page?  is it that way for everyone, or just me?  if it's happening to everyone, then what's the cause?
[07:32:30] <fof> yes i get that too in chrome
[07:32:35] <Nomikos> I like how that link is followed by a bunch of quit messages :)
[07:32:38] <jacof> Anyone tried to use the .html method in greasemonkey ? it just returns some weird things
[07:32:47] <Nomikos> I get the error too
[07:32:54] <Nomikos> http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?client=Firefox&hl=en-US&site=http://blog.jqueryui.com/
[07:34:14] <Kambfhase> Never use .html() in GM, but i know there are a lot of problems with jQ in Usercsripts
[07:34:48] <jqp> are the jquery ui folks aware that the site has been hacked?
[07:35:01] <jacof> Kambfhase: do you know how in earth to get the inner contents of an element using GM ?
[07:35:13] <scar2> gm>
[07:35:15] <scar2> ?
[07:35:15] <Kambfhase> .contents()
[07:35:22] <Kambfhase> greasemonkey
[07:35:22] <scar2> what is GM
[07:35:23] <scar2> oh
[07:35:27] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:36:20] <Nomikos> There are iframes at the bottom of the blog page pointing to the suspicious sites, maybe their blog software had a leak..
[07:37:01] <Nomikos> (oh, wordpress. right.)
[07:37:04] <Logikos_> ok i'm doing this to get childnodes: var $kids = $(this).children();    ... but my altimate goal is to copy the first 3 nodes and repeat them at the end .. so if there are 5 nodes, 1 2 3 4 5 ... i want to apend the first 3 again to the end to make 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 ... not sure where i should look to figur eout how to do that?
[07:37:18] <jacof> Kambfhase: .contents() just returns an object... do you know how to access the actual text string ?
[07:37:25] <Logikos_> seems $kids is now an array of objects ...
[07:38:00] <Logikos_> can i just appendchild $kids[0] and then $kids[1] and then $kids[2] ?
[07:38:29] <Kambfhase> Logikos_: var first3 = $(this).children(':lt(3)'); $(this).append( first3.clone());
[07:39:11] <Logikos_> what is ':lt(3)'
[07:39:17] <xarxer> Hi.. I wanna remove the <span></span> tags around a text, but keep the text itself, how would I do that?
[07:39:22] <Logikos_> i appriciate the answer, but i wana understand it lol
[07:39:27] <xarxer> Or rather, what's the most effective way to do it?
[07:39:33] <Kambfhase> http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[07:39:42] <Logikos_> ty
[07:40:00] <xec_> $kids.slice(0,2) would be the 3 first items of the collection i think
[07:40:25] <Kambfhase> ?replacewith @ xarxer
[07:40:25] <bot-t> xarxer, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[07:40:49] <xec_> $kids.slice(0,2).clone().appendTo($kids.parent()) <-- wild guess
[07:41:03] <xarxer> Kambfhase: Ah, that'd work, thanks :)
[07:41:09] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:41:35] <jacof> damn.
[07:43:00] <xec_> Logikos_: is this what youre after? http://jsbin.com/uxuyeh/edit#javascript,html
[07:43:35] <Kambfhase> xec_: yu u no use var?
[07:43:39] <Xeon06_> Hey guys
[07:43:44] <xec_> sorry, my bad
[07:43:54] <Xeon06_> Should I expect $("title").text("test") to work without any problem?
[07:44:20] <Kambfhase> Xeon06_: simply use document.title = "foobar";
[07:44:27] <xec_> Kambfhase: but i sort of expected $kids to already exist ;)
[07:44:28] <Kambfhase> no need for jQuery there
[07:44:39] <Xeon06_> Kambfhase: that's what I thought. Cause it throws an error in IE8 and below
[07:44:48] <Kambfhase> :o
[07:45:01] <Kambfhase> uhm, ok.
[07:46:49] <black_warlock> hello peepx
[07:47:11] <black_warlock> i have a resultDiv where are loaded some links via Ajax
[07:47:25] <black_warlock> using .load()
[07:48:18] <black_warlock> i need on click to open all the links conteined in the div #resultDiv in the same div
[07:48:24] <black_warlock> i wrote
[07:48:32] <black_warlock> $('#resultsDiv a').on('click',function(){
[07:48:41] <Kambfhase> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[07:48:43] <Nomikos> black_warlock: jsfiddle please
[07:48:56] <black_warlock> eh i cant its very very long script
[07:49:03] <Kambfhase> click the link i pasted.
[07:49:04] <nFFF> $('#resultsDiv a').on('click',function(){ $('a').each( //ajax
[07:50:47] <hdnine> What event/command is used in jQuery to check when a draggable image is ontop of the canvas? Is it hover or do i have to do a manual check?
[07:50:55] <arvidkahl> i ran into this problem for the first time just a few hours ago, delegation, once hinted at me, saed the day
[07:51:12] <arvidkahl> events not working that is
[07:51:40] <arvidkahl> mouseover is supposed to be the "onmousein" event
[07:52:16] <hdnine> I'm interested to check if any part of an image is above the Canvas, the canvas should get a border
[07:52:37] <hdnine> So not where the mouse is atm
[07:52:44] <arvidkahl> i see
[07:53:06] <hdnine> Not sure if hover() can be used?
[07:53:10] <arvidkahl> maybe use the offset function?
[07:53:27] <hdnine> Yeah i was thinking of that =)
[07:53:54] <hdnine> Hover seems to keep track of the mouse pos only
[07:54:24] <arvidkahl> well, the image is always placed top left at the mouse-x/mouse-y, right?
[07:55:00] <arvidkahl> so if you can get the canvas location and just check if it's inside the mousex#image-x/mouse-y+image-y boundaries..
[07:56:31] <hdnine> Got it to work thanks
[08:02:12] <black_warlock> nfff i did it no errors but nothing happens
[08:03:59] <DrShoggoth> I have a resizable using jqueryui with internal alsoResize divs,  I want to be able to set the size of the parent and propogate the events to the children without using the mouse
[08:04:13] <DrShoggoth> i still want mouse resizability,  but I want to be able to set it from elsewhere too
[08:04:23] <DrShoggoth> do i need to try and write a plugin for that?
[08:10:35] <black_warlock> nFFF: do you wanna see the page ?
[08:10:40] <black_warlock> its simple html
[08:10:53] <black_warlock> and the script its the last in the head
[08:12:01] <nFFF> sure
[08:12:26] <black_warlock> shall i pvt ya ?
[08:13:02] <nFFF> paste it here
[08:13:07] <nFFF> someone else can help also
[08:13:35] <black_warlock> its not spam pasting links in the tl ?
[08:13:35] <nFFF> whats the url?
[08:13:39] <nFFF> no
[08:13:41] <nFFF> paste url
[08:13:46] <nFFF> in chan its fine
[08:13:50] <kanzie> I built a web-app that has 12 arrays where I collect 600 data points over time. each data point is a float and a timestamp. The application starts at 60mb and grows to about 600mb after a few hours and then crashes. It seems unreasonable in size and I have no idea why this is. One suspicion I have now is that the culprit is my use of Flot-library. I re-initiate four graphs with four of the arrays every time I get a new
[08:13:50] <kanzie> datapoint. Is there any other way of redrawing that I can do?

[08:14:59] <black_warlock> after searching
[08:15:21] <DerekPioneer> i'm trying to add a loading gif. http://pastebin.com/SjEBzP3E
[08:15:27] <DerekPioneer> i want to change the img src to a loading gif
[08:15:29] <black_warlock> when the link its clicked, wish to open the content in the same divresults
[08:15:33] <DerekPioneer> and change it's height and width to 32x32
[08:15:36] <nFFF> black_warlock, jsfiddle.net
[08:15:47] <DerekPioneer> and then once the image is loaded change it back to 500x500
[08:16:30] <Shambat> using jQM 1.0.1, if I navigate to a page who's body id="page1" ... running $('#page1').bind('pageshow', function() { console.log('hello world'); }); should work right?
[08:16:32] <DerekPioneer> however when i try to add the jquery css() to change the height and width back, it also removes my 32x32 loading gif css()
[08:17:31] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: that makes sense, you're modifying the same dom element
[08:17:47] <DerekPioneer> what are my options for a loading gif?
[08:18:03] <DerekPioneer> make a new img or div for  showing the gif
[08:18:04] <johnkpaul> what type of element is .s7url
[08:18:05] <johnkpaul> an img tag?
[08:18:07] <DerekPioneer> img
[08:18:24] <johnkpaul> so what is loading, the iamge?
[08:18:31] <DerekPioneer> yeah
[08:18:33] <johnkpaul> I'd probably add another image as a sibling to .s7url
[08:18:39] <johnkpaul> hide .s7url and display the loading gif
[08:18:43] <johnkpaul> and then when it's finished loading
[08:18:52] <johnkpaul> hide the loading gif and display s7url
[08:19:05] <DerekPioneer> ok thanks
[08:25:24] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: how do i tell when $('.s7url').attr('src',url)   is loaded
[08:26:47] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: https://raw.github.com/peol/jquery.imgloaded/master/ahpi.imgload.js

[08:41:18] <johnkpaul> mirceas17: no problem, glad it could help
[08:42:07] <johnkpaul> Zzaichik: I thought it finished yesterday?
[08:42:09] <johnkpaul> I was able to use it
[08:44:00] <Zzaichik>  It says it's still migrating..  I can't seem to create any new fiddles.
[08:44:05] <Zzaichik> hmmmm
[08:54:25] <klusias> hello. on my scripts i am doing like jQuery('#' + varname), where varname is like var varname = 'minediv'; is any way to do it in "cleaner" or more beautiful way? :)
[08:56:04] <johnkpaul> :) what's so ugly about that? perhaps just name the variable something a little more udnertanable than varname
[08:56:14] <ralphholzmann> klusias: not really, but you should try and stay away from dynamic selectors
[08:56:19] <ralphholzmann> as they're not cachable
[09:02:53] <NET||abuse> hi guys,, so i have a form structure, if i have validator called, I want to float errors up the dom of the form, to one of 2 collection points, either, if there is a <div class="form-wrapper"> i want to pin it to an element inside that, or else, just have the error bubble up to the form itself, then pin the error to an element just below the start of the form
[09:03:31] * gmilby do you want fries with that? o.0
[09:03:47] <NET||abuse> the concept is that if zend uses subform output, it will wrap the parts in either a <div class="form-wrapper" or in <fieldset class="form-wrapper"
[09:04:05] <NET||abuse> so i want the validation of the form to show the errors in appropriate places on the form
[09:04:19] <tetradon> gmilby: yes please :D
[09:04:32] <NET||abuse> and if no subforms are used, just hte raw form, then i don't have a form-wrapper class'd element, so i just want it to tack on to the start of the form itself..
[09:05:12] <bobsomebody> what is the best practice to make sure animations dont overlap? I have a slider that will "over slide" if you double click fast enough
[09:06:12] <NET||abuse> is there a way to do an if else in a selector, psuedo'd here  $(error.element).parents(if ".form-warpper" else "form");
[09:07:22] <bobsomebody> NET||abuse, i ran into something like this the other night, i ended up checking hasClass in an if with else to the other
[09:08:09] <NET||abuse> bobsomebody: ok, i need a hasparent('.form-wrapper'); type check then
[09:08:44] <tazrover> How can I check to see if an <input> has text entered?  I want to trigger an event as soon as a user enters the first character.  Thanks for any help!
[09:09:03] <bobsomebody> tazrover, .change()
[09:09:07] <DerekPioneer> how do i stop a div from collapsing when i hide something inside of it
[09:09:20] <bobsomebody> sorry, keydown or keyup
[09:09:27] <tazrover> bobsomebody, thank you!
[09:09:33] <NET||abuse> DerekPioneer: min-height
[09:09:49] <Kambfhase> or visibility: hidden
[09:11:13] <NET||abuse> bobsomebody: ahh, ok so closest will look backup the dom for me, not parents
[09:12:01] <Mainmam> Jqueiry plugin tuts from sites don't involve actually installing anything, right?
[09:12:21] <bobsomebody> NET||abuse, you can do whatever.whatever.parent().hasClass()
[09:12:37] <bobsomebody> thats what i did but i wouldnt say its the only or best way
[09:12:42] <bobsomebody> it did work though lol
[09:13:04] <NET||abuse> bobsomebody: this is to serve different forms with unpredictable dom depth, so a set upward traversal won't work
[09:13:13] <NET||abuse> need the closest() method for it.
[09:13:16] <karstenk1977_> how can i take a tag from dom and place in an other div tag with jquery?
[09:13:27] <NET||abuse> then i guess i just test the length of the return of closest
[09:14:15] <bobsomebody> NET||abuse, in my case the DOM had changed which was why i needed it. Basically just a switch to check which type of slider was going
[09:15:07] <bobsomebody> NET||abuse, you can also do parents('whatever').find('what_holds').children('what_your_looking_for')
[09:15:25] <DerekPioneer> how do i retrieve the height of a div that has no css height setting but expands around its contents
[09:15:35] <bobsomebody> this again assumes atlest some structure
[09:16:11] <bobsomebody> DerekPioneer, .height() with no arguments returns it i think
[09:16:16] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: that's funny
[09:16:23] <johnkpaul> I actually just wrote gist for a similar sutaiton
[09:16:28] <johnkpaul> less than 10 minutes ago
[09:16:31] <DerekPioneer> lol
[09:16:42] <johnkpaul> https://gist.github.com/1790727
[09:17:14] <johnkpaul> mostly cross browser compatible getComputedStyle
[09:17:31] <johnkpaul> so you can call window.getComputedStylePropertyValue(yourImageElement,"height")
[09:17:38] <johnkpaul> and you will get "23px"
[09:18:08] <johnkpaul> IE7 and above
[09:18:13] <johnkpaul> I haven't tried ie6, but it might work
[09:20:00] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: Cannot call method 'getPropertyValue' of null
[09:20:15] <DerekPioneer> var rightBarHeight = window.getComputedStylePropertyValue('#rightbar','height');
[09:20:43] <johnkpaul> the first parameter isn't a selector string
[09:20:45] <johnkpaul> it's the actual element
[09:21:09] <Mainmam> Jqueiry plugin tuts from sites don't involve actually installing anything, right?\
[09:22:03] <Vorspire> var height = $('#rightbar').css('height')
[09:22:30] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: what do you mean?
[09:22:51] <DerekPioneer> something like Value($('#rightbar'),'height');
[09:22:52] <johnkpaul> window.getComputedStylePropertyValue($('#rightbar').get(0),'height');
[09:23:04] <johnkpaul> "#rightbar" is a string
[09:23:09] <johnkpaul> $('#rightbar') is a jquery wrapped element
[09:23:15] <johnkpaul> $('#rightbar').get(0) is a bare DOMElement
[09:23:20] <Mainmam> why you guys such assfiends
[09:23:29] <johnkpaul> the same as you would get from document.getElementById("rightbar"
[09:23:29] <Vorspire> I lterally just posted the code you need lol
[09:23:41] <Vorspire> var height = $('#rightbar').css('height'); <---------
[09:23:52] <DerekPioneer> Vorspire: no good if the height isn't set
[09:23:54] <johnkpaul> Vorspire: that only works if a height is expelicitly set
[09:23:56] <johnkpaul> in the css
[09:24:12] <johnkpaul> and it doesn't take into account user agent style sheets and all of that
[09:24:50] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: window.getComputedStylePropertyValue($('#rightbar').get(0),'height');
[09:24:51] <Vorspire> then outerHeight
[09:25:01] <DerekPioneer> still returns "cannot call method getPropertyValue of null
[09:25:19] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: then hmm, there's a problem with my code that I will look into
[09:25:37] <reisio> Mainmam: no, it isn't more cross browser
[09:25:41] <reisio> but yes, that _is_ the point
[09:25:45] <reisio> funny, eh?
[09:25:58] <DerekPioneer> Vorspire: outerHeight doesn't work either: $('#rightbar').css('outerHeight');   returns undefined
[09:26:05] <Mainmam> what a nig
[09:26:09] <Mainmam> i think he's just pissed
[09:26:26] <Mainmam> javascript takes 40x more code to get cross-browser support, and i haven't run into his issues
[09:27:02] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: outerheight isn't part of css
[09:27:08] <johnkpaul> http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[09:27:09] <DerekPioneer> yerah i know now
[09:27:10] <DerekPioneer> $('#rightbar').outerHeight();
[09:27:14] <DerekPioneer> returns null as well
[09:27:26] <johnkpaul> hmm, are you sure that there is an element with the id #rightbar?
[09:27:32] <black_warlock> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[09:27:39] <DerekPioneer> yes
[09:27:41] <black_warlock> jsfiddle is down =(
[09:28:16] <chovy> heh
[09:28:35] <chovy> black_warlock: works for me.
[09:29:11] <Vorspire> http://tmont.com/blargh/2010/4/get-computed-style-in-javascript
[09:29:49] <johnkpaul> Vorspire: the problem with that one is it doesn't handle the hypenated ones
[09:29:53] <johnkpaul> try using "margin-top"
[09:29:59] <johnkpaul> and it will not work in < IE9
[09:30:10] <johnkpaul> :) it's funny how I just went through this, 15 minutes ago now
[09:30:32] <Vorspire> yup - but it's still an example - I don't post links expecting people to just copy paste everything >>
[09:31:00] <Vorspire> copy paste programmers will be the death of us all, just look at W3Schools lol
[09:31:15] <DerekPioneer> what's wrong with w3schools ?
[09:31:21] <Vorspire> everything
[09:31:29] <Vorspire> http://www.w3fools.com
[09:32:36] <DerekPioneer> Vorspire: that function returns " Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'height' of null "
[09:32:48] <DerekPioneer> i must be missing something simple...
[09:33:08] <Vorspire> yeah, the element with ID "rightbar" simply doesn't exist
[09:33:18] <Vorspire> thats the only explantion i can offer
[09:33:49] <DerekPioneer> <div id="rightbar">
[09:33:53] <DerekPioneer> i'm looking at it
[09:34:00] <DerekPioneer> i *think* it's there
[09:34:03] <Onkeltem> Hi! How to get an element 'top'?
[09:34:59] <Vorspire> OnkelItem, the top-position or the top-offset?
[09:35:16] <Onkeltem> Vorspire: erm... whats the difference? :)
[09:35:30] <Vorspire> ?offset
[09:35:30] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[09:35:32] <Vorspire> ?position
[09:35:33] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[09:35:49] <Onkeltem> Vorspire: thank you!
[09:35:53] <Vorspire> yw :)
[09:36:16] <johnkpaul> Vorspire: I completely agree about w3schools
[09:36:35] <johnkpaul> I just found out that it's documentations for String.prototype.replace doesn't have a second paramter that can be a function
[09:36:43] <johnkpaul> if only it was a wiki
[09:36:50] <johnkpaul> it comes up as first when I search for javascript string replace
[09:37:02] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: can you try document.getElementById("rightbar") in your console
[09:37:07] <johnkpaul> also, are you sure you're running after domready
[09:37:15] <Paste> www.paste.co.il
[09:37:38] <Vorspire> yeah I wish it was a Wiki - but nontheless, I blocked the site from my results - hopefully Google will see a trend and take action to reduce W3School's search rank - as suggested by w3fools.com
[09:38:26] <Vorspire> $('#rightbar') should work in any scope that $ represents jQuery, not just in dom.ready
[09:39:48] <black_warlock> how you say it wokrs its on read mode
[09:40:27] <johnkpaul> Vorspire: only if the code runs after <div id="rightbar"></div> is evaluated
[09:40:41] <johnkpaul> or else, at the time he's trying to get the offsetHeight, it's not aroudn
[09:40:44] <johnkpaul> around*
[09:40:59] <DerekPioneer> i moved it into domready
[09:41:03] <DerekPioneer> and now i'm getting a return
[09:41:30] <johnkpaul> great
[09:41:46] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: I think you should read up on what domready is, do you understand why that changed things?
[09:41:46] <Vorspire> if it's baked into the DOM code - it will work, if it's created by a jQuery constructor, but hasn't been inserted into the DOM, it won't find it
[09:42:33] <DerekPioneer> no not really, i've been building this whole jquery application without really having a clue why i'm putting things inside or outside of $(function() {
[09:42:43] <DerekPioneer> i will have to do some studying
[09:43:38] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: it's very crucial to know
[09:43:41] <johnkpaul> http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/09/introducing-document-ready
[09:44:08] <Vorspire> if it helps, I always write my source to be extremely readable - you can view source on this page: http://www.pandorauo.com/HighSeasBeta/ to get a rough idea of the scope of (function($){})(jQuery); and $(function(){ });
[09:45:29] <DerekPioneer> Vorspire: nice, i like how you have that newsElem object with news: $('#index-nav-news'),
[09:46:05] <Vorspire> yeah it loads in a phpBB forum page and strips out the topics info - I love jQuery :)
[09:48:49] <Mainmam> i'm trying to fry bacon on click
[09:49:08] <DerekPioneer> ok so getComputedStylePropertyValue() is returning the height of #rightbar, but inside of domready i'm populating #rightbar with its contents
[09:49:15] <DerekPioneer> getComputedStylePropertyValue() is returning the height before it'spopulated
[09:50:01] <johnkpaul> are you caling getComputedStylePropertyValue before or after you populate it with contents?
[09:50:23] <johnkpaul> also, does offsetHeight work for you now, perhaps you don't need my getComputedStylePropertyValue
[09:50:44] <LukeNukem_> can someone see what im doing wrong here? function(event) is not working
[09:50:45] <LukeNukem_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/836840/
[09:51:37] <black_warlock> who can help me opening the content inside the same #resultsDiv ?

[09:53:06] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem_: it's not inside dom ready
[09:53:33] <black_warlock> the div class to open div resultsDiv its .content
[09:53:47] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: offsetheight returns the value before #rightbar is populated too
[09:53:56] <johnkpaul> black_warlock: there is no element that matches $('#resultsDiv a'), so that code doesn't do anything
[09:53:58] <DerekPioneer> i'm calling it after
[09:54:06] <LukeNukem_> johnkpaul, how can i fix it
[09:54:12] <black_warlock> eh ?
[09:54:18] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: what is the type of element that you are using this on? an img?
[09:54:30] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem_: move the code that attaches your click handler inside the ready function
[09:54:36] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: div
[09:54:48] <black_warlock> its the last div in the html section
[09:55:05] <johnkpaul> black_warlock: $('#resultsDiv a') doesn't match anything
[09:55:22] <black_warlock> all the links inside that div
[09:55:27] <black_warlock> or not ?
[09:55:34] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: http://pastebin.com/zwnFNjT4
[09:55:47] <DerekPioneer> createThumbnails() calls createS7UrlText, which is outside of domready
[09:56:01] <black_warlock> press SUBMIT !  the content its generated dinamically
[09:56:12] <black_warlock> via google apis
[09:56:39] <johnkpaul> black_warlock: oh I see, so then the problem is that .click() runs before those are active
[09:56:45] <johnkpaul> if you check the length of $('#resultsDiv a') it will be 0
[09:57:04] <black_warlock> have to use .on
[09:57:10] <black_warlock> after an ajax call
[09:57:24] <black_warlock> .on('click', function()
[09:57:29] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: damn, that code is a little confusing, my gut tells me that you either have a static heightsomewhere or  you have overflow hdiden
[09:57:30] <black_warlock> but it wont work
[09:57:47] <johnkpaul> black_warlock: jQuery delegate is what you want
[09:57:50] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: yeah that code is really confusing
[09:58:08] <karstenk1977_> How can I ask if text is in a tag?
[09:58:27] <black_warlock> $(this).attr('tag')
[09:58:36] <LukeNukem_> johnkpaul, isn't it inside already
[09:59:01] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem_: i don't think so, but I can't really tell, your indentation is all over the place
[10:00:23] <LukeNukem_> :<
[10:00:24] <hdnine> Could someone quickly explain how the ".draggable" "ui.helper" works? I have the helper activate with a clone being dragged. I'm trying to get the position where the helper was dropped but can't figure out how? Thanks!
[10:00:27] <black_warlock> nFFF: got the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KdRM7/5/
[10:00:32] <LukeNukem_> how do i move it inside the ready function
[10:01:30] <black_warlock> what ?
[10:01:33] <nFFF> black_warlock 10 hours later lol
[10:01:41] <black_warlock> jsfiddle was down
[10:01:44] <black_warlock> =(
[10:01:50] <black_warlock> i had it in read mode only
[10:01:54] <nFFF> what are you trying to do?
[10:04:23] <black_warlock> opening the div class= "content" inside #resultsDiv"
[10:04:32] <black_warlock> from the linked page
[10:04:41] <black_warlock> not possible ?
[10:04:56] <nFFF> You dont have any links on the jsfiddle dude?
[10:05:06] <black_warlock> press submit
[10:05:12] <black_warlock> its a search
[10:05:21] <black_warlock> via google apis
[10:05:30] <black_warlock> AMMMMAAAAAZZZING apis
[10:05:48] <nFFF> submit does nothing
[10:05:54] <nFFF> oh wait
[10:05:55] <nFFF> it does
[10:05:59] <nFFF> was delayed
[10:06:00] <black_warlock> ^_^
[10:06:16] <black_warlock> can search any site from your site with that code
[10:06:27] <Mainmam> wtf
[10:06:32] <Mainmam> this plugin didn't work at all
[10:06:35] <Mainmam> WTTFR?!?
[10:06:50] <black_warlock> WTRFROPFGM ?
[10:07:17] <nFFF> I think the issue is becuase it's dynsamically loaded content
[10:08:17] <black_warlock> but wasnt enough to put .on('click' ?
[10:08:23] <black_warlock> after a div its generated ?
[10:08:33] <black_warlock> i mean populated
[10:08:47] <black_warlock> i think the block its because it outer page
[10:09:06] <black_warlock> deammmmmmm
[10:09:13] <hdnine> How does the .draggable "ui.helper" work? I have the helper activated with a clone being dragged. I'm trying to get the position where the helper was dropped but can't figure out how? Thanks!
[10:09:49] <black_warlock> i used to skip that problem using .live
[10:10:07] <black_warlock> but this page its outside the blog
[10:10:21] <black_warlock> thats why its not loading
[10:10:22] <nFFF> I think you need to bind to a higher level
[10:10:27] <nFFF> Try binding the click to the body
[10:10:31] <nFFF> and checking what was clicked
[10:10:38] <nFFF> or just resultsdiv
[10:10:45] <Ortund> how can I select an html5 element like <comments></comments> ? I'm getting an "Undefined" error
[10:10:56] <black_warlock> the problem its that wont let me alert the href content O.o
[10:11:07] <Ortund> check out http://www.loganyoung.za.net/read.php?id=6 for an example
[10:11:43] <black_warlock> i did it
[10:11:58] <nFFF> work?
[10:11:58] <arvidkahl> how? :)
[10:12:00] <black_warlock> it works fine on all the other links found inside the page
[10:12:01] <mstsc> selling dedicated servers in different countries, only windows xp,2003,2008, seven
[10:12:13] <kborchers> Ortund: $("comments").hide(); you're missing quotes
[10:12:16] <Kambfhase> Ortund: jQuery("comment") works for me
[10:12:16] <black_warlock> just inside that resultsDiv doesnt work
[10:13:09] <Ortund> lol "object has no method "visible""
[10:13:19] <nFFF> black_warlock
[10:13:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/KdRM7/6/
[10:13:49] <nFFF> You need to bind to an element that was loaded from the start
[10:13:52] <nFFF> and check the target
[10:13:59] <black_warlock> O.o
[10:14:02] <black_warlock> hell
[10:14:04] <black_warlock> ye
[10:14:07] <nFFF> you can't bind directly to future dynamically loaded content
[10:14:16] <nFFF> as the bind takes place on page load
[10:14:40] <nFFF> Your simply trying to bind for something that doesn't exist
[10:15:03] <black_warlock> aye
[10:15:05] <nFFF> Whereas you need to bind to an element that exists in the DOM, and then on click check to see if the target is correct
[10:15:07] <black_warlock> you made a recall
[10:15:52] <black_warlock> hum
[10:15:59] <black_warlock> it will probably work now
[10:16:03] <black_warlock> lemme try
[10:16:14] <LukeNukem_> can someone please just help me :(
[10:16:23] <nFFF> LukeNukem_ with?
[10:16:43] <LukeNukem_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/836876/
[10:16:48] <LukeNukem_> the alert is not working :(
[10:16:53] <Ortund> think I should just use normal divs for this...
[10:17:02] <Kambfhase> alert is not a debugger
[10:17:36] <LukeNukem_> well its a better way since idk where the log is o.o
[10:18:00] <LukeNukem_> nFFF, have you look at code?
[10:18:08] <nFFF> no
[10:18:10] <nFFF> jsfiddle.net
[10:18:33] <Kambfhase> LukeNukem_: you need to use .live or .on() here!
[10:19:10] <LukeNukem_> jsf is not loading :(
[10:19:15] <LukeNukem_> Kambfhase, where?
[10:19:50] <Kambfhase> on line 23, you add a click handler, but the #damn element is added to the DOM later!
[10:20:25] <bulco> is jsfiddle.net down?
[10:20:29] <LukeNukem_> oh so i should use .live
[10:20:37] <Kambfhase> indeed
[10:20:49] <LukeNukem_> can you show me an example
[10:21:18] <Kambfhase> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[10:21:39] <LukeNukem_> im not writing an ajax request....
[10:21:44] <bulco> can someone help me stop animations from building up with a simple image rotator? http://pastebin.com/tVUY69yq
[10:22:09] <Kambfhase> but its the same fucking usecase.
[10:22:44] <bulco> i know i should chain stop() into the process, i'm just not sure where
[10:22:48] <tetradon> how do I get closest element to current element on hover? Current element is an <a> element
[10:22:52] <bulco> or should i completely clear the animation queue?
[10:23:24] <tetradon> this is what I have so far: $(this).parent().children('span').closest(this)
[10:23:30] <black_warlock> .live is deprecated
[10:23:35] <black_warlock> use .on()
[10:23:57] <bulco> black_warlock: talking to me?
[10:24:12] <LukeNukem_> Is this good
[10:24:12] <LukeNukem_> $("#damn").live("click",function(event){
[10:24:31] <black_warlock> .on("click",
[10:24:32] <nFFF> LukeNukem_, do what I suggested to black_warlock
[10:24:41] <nFFF> bind the event to an element already in the DOM
[10:24:42] <Ortund> check out http://www.loganyoung.za.net/read.php?id=6            <<< now that comments section doesn't look too bad imo :)
[10:24:47] <nFFF> and check on click what the target is
[10:25:00] <nFFF> a parent element that is
[10:25:14] <black_warlock> tetradon .closest()
[10:25:20] <black_warlock> or .next()
[10:25:21] <nFFF> I think live is deprecated in favour of on() and bind()
[10:26:05] <Kambfhase> tetradon: you mean closest as in geometrically closest?
[10:27:15] <black_warlock> im touching jqlimit !
[10:27:23] <black_warlock> bleble ble bleeeeeeee
[10:27:59] <black_warlock> look that http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KdRM7/7/
[10:28:02] <black_warlock> ^^
[10:28:40] <tetradon> Maybe I should rephrase the question. I'm getting the parent of an <a> element. I want to get the <span> child closest to the <a> element.
[10:29:43] <Kambfhase> what do you mean by "closest"?
[10:29:53] <tetradon> <span> is not in the same parent as <a>
[10:30:11] <nFFF> Anyone know why this wo't alert: http://jsfiddle.net/bxYZX/
[10:30:11] <tetradon> It's in the parent's parent
[10:30:31] <tetradon> so I don't think closest will work
[10:30:42] <black_warlock> whatch this exemple
[10:30:48] <Mainmam> it's in the grandfather
[10:30:51] <Kambfhase> nFFF: no wrap?
[10:30:53] <black_warlock> on how to use closest next fin and so on
[10:30:54] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/EXZ9r/45/
[10:31:34] <Kambfhase> nFFF: go for onDomReady.
[10:31:43] <nFFF> Yea my bad
[10:31:43] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/bxYZX/1/
[10:31:47] <nFFF> why doesnt this work?
[10:31:53] <tetradon> I'll put my code on jsfiddle
[10:32:21] <nFFF> Shit
[10:32:23] <nFFF> case sensitive
[10:32:26] <nFFF> didn't even realize
[10:32:39] <black_warlock> lol
[10:32:41] <nFFF> fuuuuuu
[10:32:50] <nFFF> spent 20 minutes trying ot figure this out
[10:32:52] <black_warlock> was just saying "case sensitive" :P
[10:33:09] <LukeNukem_> how would i go about animating a form to appear once add_pic is clicked?
[10:33:10] <Kambfhase> text A string of text to look for. It's case sensitive.
[10:33:13] <LukeNukem_> show me an example please?
[10:33:28] <redheadphones> how do people unit test selectors that have actions like .css() and .fadeIn()?
[10:33:39] <redheadphones> looking into qunit now
[10:33:44] <karstenk1977_> please can you correct it?   var messageIs = ((jQuery('.blogCommentMessage') > 0)&&(!jQuery('.blogCommentMessage').is(':empty')));
[10:34:01] <Kambfhase> i dont unit test when i am not getting paid for it. :o
[10:34:15] <redheadphones> :p
[10:34:19] <Kambfhase> karstenk1977_: check .length!
[10:34:41] <karstenk1977_> upps
[10:35:15] <black_warlock> did you make that website nFFF ?
[10:35:24] <black_warlock> nice one  :P
[10:35:58] <nFFF> Which site?
[10:36:52] <Kambfhase> google.com
[10:37:00] <nFFF> yea with my friend larry
[10:37:05] <black_warlock> safeguard
[10:37:15] <nFFF> yea i designed and built safeguard
[10:37:42] <black_warlock> the "G" its similar to HTML 5  logo
[10:37:47] <black_warlock> XD
[10:38:01] <black_warlock> anyway nicely done
[10:38:04] <nFFF> :DD
[10:38:16] <nFFF> To be honest we always ahd a shield, but updated it recently :Z
[10:38:27] <black_warlock> gh
[10:38:32] <nFFF> Thanks for kind words
[10:38:42] <bulco> is there any way to update an external js file on jsfiddle?
[10:38:53] <bulco> i get the feeling a js file is cached
[10:39:12] <Kambfhase> ctrl+F5
[10:39:21] <tetradon> is jsfiddle.net still not working? I can't get anything to save
[10:40:34] <karstenk1977_> why is this false [ ((jQuery('.blogCommentMessage').length > 0)&&(!jQuery('.blogCommentMessage').is(':empty'))) ] when there is a div.blogCommentMessage with text in it?
[10:40:57] <bulco> oh nevermind, i'm an idiot
[10:43:02] <tetradon> okay here's what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/ruckus/LDv9w/1/
[10:43:49] <tetradon> I need to get the span closest to the <a> element on hover
[10:43:59] <Kambfhase> karstenk1977_: ':empty' does not mean 'not text' but 'no children, iirc
[10:44:08] <Sugitime> To run in noConflict() mode, I just change all $ to jQuery right?
[10:44:27] <devOlsen> tetradon http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:44:45] <nFFF> Why do you need to check both?
[10:45:01] <nFFF> jQuery('.blogCommentMessage').text().length != 0
[10:45:32] <devOlsen> wouldnt !jQuery('.blogCommentMessage').text().length work just as well?
[10:45:42] <Kambfhase> ?prev @ tetradon
[10:45:42] <bot-t> tetradon, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[10:45:51] <Vorspire> karstenk1977 - var nullOrEmpty = ( !$('.blogCommentMessage') || !$('.blogCommentMessage').children() );
[10:45:52] <nFFF> devOlsen yes
[10:45:58] <nFFF> good point
[10:46:03] <nFFF> javascript treats 0 as false
[10:46:05] <Kambfhase> oh, sorry, maybe prevAll('span')
[10:46:22] <Kambfhase> and then .prevAll('span').first()
[10:46:30] <Mainmam> Is there a good site with Jquery examples with practice files?
[10:46:38] <tetradon> Kambfhase: that's what I needed to know. Thank you.
[10:46:48] <Mainmam> need some hands-on practice.
[10:46:50] <Kambfhase> hope it help
[10:46:57] <devOlsen> .prevAll('span').eq(0) also works.
[10:47:35] <Vorspire> .prevAll('span:first') ?
[10:47:52] <devOlsen> :) or that I believe as well
[10:51:45] <karstenk1977_> Vorspire: Sorry it doesn´t work
[10:52:00] <karstenk1977_> get false
[10:52:45] <Vorspire> that means it's not null or empty :)
[10:53:32] <Vorspire> so if you wanted to say "does it exists - if yes, do this" : if( !nullOrEmpty ){ /* It exists and is not empty */ }
[10:54:25] <Vorspire> but I think devOlsen was right - it's not children you're looking for it's the actual comment text right?
[10:56:20] <Vorspire> karstenk1977 - var nullOrEmpty = ( !$('.blogCommentMessage') || !$.trim($('.blogCommentMessage').clone().children().remove().end().text()).length );
[10:56:42] <Kambfhase> !$('.blogCommentMessage')  << wont work
[10:56:48] <Kambfhase> will always be true
[10:57:18] <Kambfhase> er false.
[10:57:26] <Kambfhase> ?eval $('foo')
[10:57:27] <bot-t> Kambfhase: []
[10:57:31] <Vorspire> that's true actually yea... since it's a jQuery object, we'd have to explicitly check length lol
[10:57:33] <Kambfhase> ?eval !$('foo')
[10:57:33] <bot-t> Kambfhase: false
[10:57:40] <Kambfhase> ?eval !$('<foo>')
[10:57:41] <bot-t> Kambfhase: false
[10:58:11] <brekfist> i need to create a page that has a bunch of links at the top, and pulls content into a content area below, via ajax.  BUT i also need a way of linking directly to the page in a particular state (i.e. with ContentB.html loaded in the content area).
[10:58:24] <brekfist> what to use for that?
[10:58:38] <Vorspire> ?tabs @ brekfist
[10:58:40] <bot-t> brekfist, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[10:59:32] <brekfist> hmm. looks like they always display as tabs though? there will end up being a lot of these links/conents
[10:59:37] <brekfist> *contents
[11:00:12] <Vorspire> yeah, i wrote my own "tabs" emulator because I don't like the UI tabs structure :/ you'll probably have to do the same
[11:00:29] <Vorspire> especially if you want the tabs part in a separate element to the containing contents
[11:01:49] <brekfist> the tabs part in a separate element to the containing contents?
[11:01:57] <brekfist> trying to parse....
[11:02:44] <Vorspire> brekfist - you can always create a <UL> that lists all of the <A> or <button> elelemnts you want to represent the tabs - then subscribe to onClick on each button and have it $.ajax or .load content to another <DIV> on the page (the target container for content)
[11:04:15] <Vorspire> brekfist - simulated tabs example: http://www.pandorauo.com/HighSeasBeta
[11:04:21] <jacof> any reason why this isn't working: -> $.get('http://www.site.com/dbController.php?o=insert&'+getString);
[11:04:29] <brekfist> yes, that's what i was thinking. ul with anchors. probably $.ajax, but I haven't looked at the difference between ajax() & load()
[11:04:53] <brekfist> but then when i realized you'd have to link to it i got confused. can i use named anchors?
[11:05:17] <Vorspire> load will load the given url's content into the selected elements, whereas $.ajax requires more options and a handler for the success, etc
[11:06:10] <brekfist> so load is the same ajax but lighter? i don't plan on error handling or anything. just want to shove content in there.
[11:06:55] <Vorspire> yeah load will do you fine :)
[11:07:06] <Vorspire> load is short-hand that wraps around ajax
[11:07:20] <Eviltwin> see ?load see ?ajax
[11:07:20] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:07:21] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:08:11] <Vorspire> Eviltwin i think it brought up the wrong .load
[11:08:22] <Eviltwin> Oh, it did
[11:08:29] <Eviltwin> see ?load(...,...)
[11:08:30] <bot-t> .load([eventData], handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:08:32] <Vorspire> ?shorthand/load
[11:08:34] <bot-t> Vorspire, .ready() - Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:08:35] <Eviltwin> see ?load(...,...,...)
[11:08:35] <bot-t> .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/

[11:08:38] <Eviltwin> There we go
[11:08:43] <Vorspire> nice

[11:10:11] <Pilate> jacof*
[11:10:15] <Eviltwin> jacof: It'd be a violation of Same Origin Policy
[11:10:15] <Vorspire> it can if you enable the crossBrowser option (true)
[11:10:25] <Vorspire> but it won't work in IE regardless
[11:10:34] <jacof> i'm trying in FF
[11:10:46] <eddiemonge> What tools do you use to test your code’s performance?
[11:10:53] <Eviltwin> jsperf?
[11:11:09] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ jacof
[11:11:10] <bot-t> jacof, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin.

[11:12:34] <jacof> im trying to get a greasemonkey script to send data over to a submit.php in another domain
[11:13:32] <Vorspire> jacof - easiest way to do that is to use a local PHP file to process your request and send the data using cURL to your remote php handler
[11:14:47] <BFranks> Nevermind.. I switched to rgb(r,g,b) method and it's working.. Thanks though..
[11:15:06] <jacof> greasemonkey can handle it as it turns out GM_xmlhttpRequest
[11:15:11] <Vorspire> BFranks you had been using 2 bytes too many in your hex codes
[11:16:24] <Vorspire> rather, one byte too many
[11:20:33] <chovy> does anyone know if we can submit plugins to the new plugin site yet?
[11:21:33] <Vorspire> did they wipe the old database chovy?
[11:21:48] <chovy> Vorspire: yeah
[11:21:55] <Vorspire> damn :(
[11:22:21] <chovy> yeah.
[11:22:28] <chovy> i was shocked they didn't have a backup.
[11:22:32] <Vorspire> looksl ike i'll have to find google cached versions of my plugin docs... never saved them :(
[11:22:39] <chovy> i guess they got a ton of spam too.
[11:22:58] <Vorspire> I think it was because spam bots got in and filled it with crap, but can't say for certain
[11:23:11] <chovy> Does anyone want to do a code review for my plugin?
[11:23:17] <chovy> https://github.com/chovy/tabbed-navigation
[11:23:25] <chovy> it's pretty simple/
[11:24:20] <Vorspire> I've never been a big fan of GitHub.. but looks like I might just turn to the dark side after all :D
[11:24:34] <chovy> Vorspire: it's ok for projects.
[11:24:42] <chovy> the social networking aspect of it is pretty bad though.
[11:24:59] <Vorspire> What does your plugin provide that tabs UI doesn't? or is it intended to emulate them without requiring jQueryUI?
[11:25:30] <chovy> Vorspire: yeah. it's supposed to be a light-weight alternative to including jquery-ui
[11:25:42] <Vorspire> ahh that's nice :D
[11:26:43] <brekfist> wait so do you guys know another way of linking to a particular ajax load state?
[11:26:44] <Engin> jQuery.fn.foo = function(){ I want to do stuff on this and its children... what's a neat way to select them ?}
[11:27:28] <Vorspire> chovy - I like it, nice and simple, just noticed one thing though - back button history support?
[11:28:56] <brekfist> Vorspire: I'm looking at pandorauo and I don't see how you would link to, e.g. Rules…. Is there a way to tell the page to open with that section?
[11:30:03] <jon_x> been searching on the net for something pretty simple.. is there a way to determine max size of the browser window.. NOT the current browers size?
[11:30:31] <johnkpaul> jon_x: I don't think so without using flash or java
[11:30:51] <brekfist> yeah i don' think the browser would know that.
[11:31:17] <Vorspire> brekfist - check for the varaible named loadTab
[11:31:31] <brekfist> ok
[11:31:33] <Vorspire> in the <script> at the bottom of the source
[11:32:15] <DerekPioneer> i have a large json variable that i want to track changes to so i can give users an "undo" button, any ideas?
[11:32:15] <DerekPioneer> wheneve
[11:32:15] <DerekPioneer> r
[11:32:25] <DerekPioneer> whenever the user interacts with the array he changes 1-5 variables
[11:33:41] <Vorspire> brekfist, sorry about that, you're not seeing the whole picture with that source directly, the rest is handled within the uiWidgets plugin: http://www.pandorauo.com/javascript/widgets/vn/navwidgets.js
[11:34:19] <Vorspire> http://www.pandorauo.com/javascript/widgets/vn.navwidgets.js ***
[11:34:31] <brekfist> so basically you are using named anchors?
[11:35:03] <Vorspire> ffs, my FTP client is giving me relative links lol - http://www.pandorauo.com/HighSeasBeta/javascript/widgets/vn.navwidgets.js
[11:35:56] <Vorspire> I'm not using named anchors as such, just to identify the tab taht I want to load, the other tabs do have ID's but they are actually never used
[11:36:09] <Vorspire> unless you used the address bar #hash to match against them
[11:36:24] <Vorspire> ahh this is probably a bit obscure for what you want to do
[11:38:08] <brekfist> did you write that custom or is that part of jquery ui? i really wasn't trying to get that deep....
[11:38:39] <brekfist> but it also looks like i could skip most of the UI
[11:40:00] <brekfist> yeah i was just wondering if could use that to parse the hash out of the url.
[11:40:30] <brekfist> domain.com/ajaxypage.html#article5
[11:42:17] <brekfist> what does vn.navwidgets.js do?
[11:42:26] <Vorspire> brekfist - yeah, i write all my stuff from scratch usually
[11:42:43] <Vorspire> the very least basic code you want is something like: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/pz9uU/
[11:42:44] <brekfist> i sort of envy that, and sort of don't ;-)
[11:42:50] <Vorspire> hehe
[11:47:56] <brekfist> Vorspire: that's pretty much what I wrote, but then I realized I needed to be able to link from outside to the page with, say, tab 2 loaded, or tab 23 loaded. can't figure out what the best way of doing that is.
[11:49:34] <Engin> is there a selector for self and all children
[11:50:25] <Vorspire> brekfist yeah, that's where that little bit of location.hash comes in
[11:50:55] <brekfist> yeah i'm poking around and i don't see anything really else
[11:51:02] <brekfist> well okay dive in then
[11:51:03] <Vorspire> brekfist - basically since # already represents an "id" of an element with selectors, you can hijack location.hash and have it look directly for an element matching the given hash
[11:51:04] <brekfist> thanks
[11:52:21] <Vorspire> brekfist - i think this is what you need: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/pz9uU/
[11:52:40] <Vorspire> it has protection againt selecting element ID's that are not children of your UL tabs
[11:52:46] <brekfist> right seems more direct than named anchors i guess, since you don't want the anchor, you want the thing they point to.
[11:52:53] <brekfist> but actually that doesn't seem more direct.
[11:55:03] <Engin> wtf is going on 980 people and no answer ?!
[11:55:22] <evan_luck> I'm just here to troll...
[11:55:37] <evan_luck> and no I don't think there's a single selector for self + children
[11:55:42] <Vorspire> brekfist, so basically with that code there, you can supply http://domain.tld/index.html#hello - to auto load tab with ID #hello
[11:55:52] <evan_luck> any particular kind of node you're looking for?
[11:56:49] <evan_luck> Engin: try $('#thing_you_want').add('#thing_you_want *').do_whatever()
[11:56:49] <Vorspire> $('#selection > *').andSelf().doSomething
[11:56:57] <Engin> oh add ?
[11:57:00] <Engin> let me see
[11:57:05] <evan_luck> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[11:57:05] <Vorspire> ?andSelf
[11:57:06] <bot-t> .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[11:57:12] <Engin> oooh suprising that it never struck my eye before
[11:57:13] <evan_luck> oooooh
[11:57:14] <brekfist> Vorspire: you use length just to get a non-zero value? just to validate that there's a hash there?
[11:57:16] <evan_luck> that's nice
[11:58:21] <Vorspire> brekfist - basically, it searches for the hash and checks to see if the UL contains an LI that matches the ID - if it doesn't length would be 0 and 0 represents false
[11:58:32] <Engin> oooh
[11:59:37] <Vorspire> yeah that andSelf example I gave was wrong... $('#selection').children().andSelf().doSomething might be more appropriate heh
[12:02:49] <Engin> yeah I know
[12:02:50] <spectre^> hai
[12:03:06] <Engin> i was doing this $(this).find('.l18n').addSelf()
[12:03:11] <Engin> it solved the problem beautifully
[12:03:16] <spectre^> How do I get rid of the styles that .tabs() is giving my tabs?
[12:03:47] <spectre^> When I dont call .tabs() they look right, when I do they look like a default tab setup, and I cant figure out how to make it not apply those styles
[12:04:32] <spectre^> I looked at the jquery site but I didnt really understand from the docs how to do it
[12:04:34] <eddiemonge> spectre^: dont include the jqueryui stylesheet is one way
[12:04:51] <eddiemonge> spectre^: another is to override those styles in your styles
[12:06:47] <Vorspire> spectre^ - chovy has a nice tabs emulator that doesn't require jQueryUI
[12:06:55] <Vorspire> chovy can you link it again?
[12:08:36] <Vorspire> spectre^ : https://github.com/chovy/tabbed-navigation
[12:11:04] <BFranks> Vorspie: Good eye.. I was using the 'ahex' value from JPicker so the HEX wasn't crafted by me.. http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/
[12:15:38] <kenperkins> is anyone using backbone?
[12:16:41] <johnkpaul> kenperkins: yep, I'm using backbone
[12:17:15] <kenperkins> are you able to extend the code when post/put etc to sign your message (hmac for example)
[12:17:49] <johnkpaul> sign your message?
[12:18:02] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean Backbone.sync?
[12:18:37] <johnkpaul> you can override backbone.sync to do whatever you'd like with your models
[12:18:45] <johnkpaul> #documentcloud is probably the better palce to get more info though
[12:18:47] <johnkpaul> not #jquery
[12:20:25] <prometh> danzik17: what's wrong about my event handling?
[12:21:27] <danzik17> prometh: the click events from your button element are bubbling up to your li, therefore "expandListItem" is being called twice
[12:21:34] <danzik17> paste this in and watch the magic.  $("ul > li > div > button").on("click", false)
[12:22:11] <ajpiano> prometh: also, it's borderline insane to traverse the dom, get to an element, then just get it's index, and then use that number to do a brand new fresh DOM query again
[12:22:30] <prometh> i know
[12:22:33] <prometh> but i'm new to jquery
[12:22:40] <prometh> trying to learn as many logical shortcuts as possible
[12:22:52] <prometh> i'm used to doing things with plain js
[12:22:54] <danzik17> that's a pretty bad shortcut =P
[12:22:58] <ajpiano> that's a longcut
[12:23:12] <prometh> but wiht plain js, i could use many vars, which cuts down cpu usage
[12:23:24] <prometh> with jquery, it's different
[12:23:28] <ajpiano> whaaaaaaaat
[12:23:37] <prometh> can be similar, but i'm new to it
[12:23:38] <ajpiano> jquery is javascript, you can use as many variables as you want
[12:23:40] <danzik17> yea, damn that jQuery.  what language did those fools write it in anyway?
[12:23:49] <prometh> you're misunderstanding me
[12:23:50] <danzik17> :)
[12:23:52] <prometh> the approach is dfiferent
[12:24:10] <prometh> i'm trying to make it as similar as i can.. but i'm new to it
[12:24:19] <eddiemonge> prometh: you do know jquery IS javascript right?
[12:24:39] <prometh> i thought it was assembler? :P
[12:24:53] <ajpiano> prometh: it's just as wise in jQuery to cache a result set as it is in javascript
[12:24:54] <ajpiano> if not moreso
[12:24:58] <ajpiano> var these = $(".these")
[12:24:59] <ajpiano> etc
[12:25:03] <prometh> i know.. i have been
[12:25:07] <prometh> but it still feels different
[12:25:23] <prometh> so i'm not as efficient with jquery as i am plain js
[12:26:12] <eddiemonge> youre jquery code should augment your pure JS, not replace it completley
[12:27:52] <prometh> ?
[12:28:07] <prometh> the ewhole point of jquery is to avoid using getElementById/TagName, etc
[12:28:10] <prometh> so it does replace a lot
[12:28:23] <eddiemonge> no its not
[12:28:30] <eddiemonge> you can still use getelebyid
[12:28:35] <prometh> why would i?
[12:28:42] <ajpiano> that is far from "The whole point of jQuery"
[12:28:49] <eddiemonge> and if that equates to a lot, your JS code must be terribly inefficient as well
[12:28:50] <ajpiano> but i lack the time to discuss this further
[12:28:51] <prometh> a bit point
[12:29:10] <prometh> meh
[12:29:16] <prometh> i don't have time to discuss this either
[12:29:28] <eddiemonge> you would use it because its still fastest way to get an element by id
[12:29:58] <prometh> the whole point of jquery is to make javascript quicker to write
[12:30:02] <prometh> so your point is moot
[12:30:18] <danzik17> prometh: no, it's not.  it's to make cross-browser code less painful.
[12:30:29] <prometh> quicker to write
[12:30:33] <prometh> same thing
[12:30:36] <eddiemonge> not really
[12:30:47] <prometh> cross-browser js takes a while to write
[12:30:48] <prometh> and test
[12:30:54] <prometh> jquery == quicker
[12:31:13] <eddiemonge> write less, do more
[12:31:22] <eddiemonge> not write quicker, perform horribly
[12:31:24] <prometh> so, it replaces a lot of pure js code
[12:31:38] <prometh> omg, i'm new to it
[12:31:42] <falcom> so i have a selector object var foo = $("#foo")
[12:31:43] <bot-t> (387 hours ago) <coldhead> tell falcom PUNNNNCH
[12:31:45] <prometh> i can only write so much perfect code
[12:31:58] <falcom> how can i get the ".contents" inside that element?
[12:33:06] <eddiemonge> falcom: by .contents do you mean an element with className of "Contents" or do you mean everything in the element with ID foo?
[12:33:28] <falcom> eddiemonge: className
[12:33:37] <eddiemonge> ?find @ falcom
[12:33:37] <bot-t> falcom, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:33:42] <Engin> opposite of .parseJSON ?
[12:33:49] <Engin> no json serialization in jq ?
[12:33:52] <ajpiano> ?stringify @ Engin
[12:33:53] <bot-t> Engin, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[12:34:11] <eddiemonge> Engin: what do you want to do this for?
[12:34:52] <Engin> to serialize objects into string and back to store in cookie
[12:35:07] <ajpiano> Engin: look at the link i just sent, it is *the* answer.
[12:35:58] <Engin> ajpiano: yeah, just wondered if jq offers it
[12:36:19] <ajpiano> well now you know
[12:37:24] <prometh> www.mbrennen.com/help/test-case.html
[12:37:33] <Engin> yup
[12:37:34] <prometh> why does the button in the third item not work?
[12:37:51] <Surrealis> how would i find the text in the same row one td over from where the input is?
[12:38:03] <sorahn> what is the difference between these 2 calls.
[12:38:03] <sorahn> https://gist.github.com/1792677
[12:38:53] <ajpiano> sorahn: the latter call calls setSize once and returns the result of it as a function to be called on window resize
[12:38:55] <Engin> actually i could use an unparam if there was one, right
[12:39:06] <ajpiano> the former calls setSize on every actual resize
[12:39:08] <Engin> there's param for serialization of objects... but again... no opposite
[12:39:08] <prometh> on a click event, i do on("click",funct) and it fuggin' triggers that event immediately... wtf?
[12:39:24] <sorahn> ah, alright.  Thanks :)
[12:39:41] <Engin> actually i have a custom .unparam... hmm
[12:39:44] <ajpiano> prometh: sorahn this answers both of your questions http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[12:40:40] <prometh> ajpiano: i'm not doing that
[12:40:43] <prometh> i create an anonmyous function
[12:40:56] <prometh> and it gets triggered somehow
[12:41:17] <ajpiano> prometh: do you know what event bubbling is?
[12:41:40] <prometh> sorta.. only needed it once or twice... how does that affect me in this instance?
[12:42:17] <ajpiano> prometh: if you are binding a handler for an event at one level, and the event keeps bubbling and it ends up triggering the event you just attached at a higher level
[12:42:46] <prometh> why would it keep bubbling?
[12:42:54] <ajpiano> because events bubble
[12:43:04] <prometh> yeah, i don't understand that concept
[12:43:12] <ajpiano> allz i'm saying is the problem you were having before was also because of event bubblign
[12:43:19] <Mainmam> just used my real adobe user/password to login to a newly cracked css5
[12:43:29] <Mainmam> prolly not PS CS5*
[12:43:31] <eddiemonge> prometh: it doesnt work because there is no .next() after that button
[12:43:38] <ajpiano> Mainmam: wrong channel?
[12:43:47] <prometh> eddiemonge: it works... it creates an index of -1
[12:43:57] <Mainmam> nah
[12:44:06] <Mainmam> i need it for web design
[12:44:09] <ajpiano> Mainmam: cool story
[12:44:21] <prometh> i have an event on the parent and the child.... but the parent event gets removed so that the child can function... then when the child is clicked, the parent's event is re-added.... but then gets triggered!
[12:44:21] <Mainmam> thnx
[12:44:46] <prometh> so, i guess the bubble is expanding to the parent.. which, in my opinion, shouldn't happen since the click has ALREADY occurred
[12:44:48] <eddiemonge> prometh: why not just use see ? stoppropagation
[12:44:48] <bot-t> prometh, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:45:11] <prometh> yeah, i may use that... but, that feels like a hack
[12:45:19] <ajpiano> it's not a hack, it's how you deal with event bubbling
[12:45:33] <ajpiano> your opinion about how bubbling quote unquote should work is completley irrelevant to browsers where it is already implemented
[12:45:36] <prometh> but it shouldn't BE bubbling at all since the event has already taken place
[12:45:48] <prometh> i'm trying to make sense of it
[12:46:31] <prometh> why would it bubble after the event has taken place?
[12:46:39] <prometh> that's just retarded, imho
[12:47:00] <eddiemonge> "I'm sure that this is a jQuery bug." lol this is uttered so many times and it very rarely is ever accurate
[12:47:07] <erichynds> so parent elements can capture it
[12:47:20] <prometh> eddiemonge: that was a long time ago
[12:47:24] <prometh> and it may still stand.. time will tell
[12:47:35] <ajpiano> the same event continues happening.  you set it during the point at which it is lower down in the DOM tree
[12:47:41] <ajpiano> and then it is caught when the event bubbles up higher up
[12:47:50] <prometh> erichynds: so, the parent captures it after the child, not at the same time?
[12:47:53] <ajpiano> to menu > li
[12:47:54] <ajpiano> yes
[12:47:58] <erichynds> yes indeed
[12:48:02] <prometh> ok, then it makes sense to me now
[12:48:03] <prometh> thank you
[12:48:40] <prometh> now i have to sit and think [more]
[12:49:32] <Whirl3d> Hey all, I have been asking for help in #jquerymobile to no avail. Does anyone know why my site looks tiny when I update to jqmobile 1.01?
[12:51:22] <mutedia> hey, I'm trying to set a on() delegate on an audioplayer, binding works but on() is tons faster and I'm not sure how to go about that
[12:51:32] <mutedia> for the onended event, which I bind as 'ended'
[12:52:28] <Whirl3d> $("radio").on("ended", targ, function(e) { do something });
[12:52:31] <Whirl3d> ?
[12:52:48] <mutedia> that doesn't work
[12:52:56] <mutedia> I Don't think it does
[12:53:04] <Whirl3d> did you try onended
[12:53:15] <Whirl3d> .on ("onended", ....
[12:53:17] <mutedia> yeah, but as I've read somewhere it's 'ended'
[12:53:24] <mutedia> the bind works but .on doesn't
[12:53:29] <mutedia> I think it has to do with event bubbling
[12:53:38] <Whirl3d> yeah, don't know about audio at all. sorry.
[12:53:38] <mutedia> from what I read on this message board
[12:53:42] <prometh> one more question.... you guys have said that getting the index of a an element each time it is clicked is not a good idea... how would you do it with a group of elements?
[12:53:45] <mutedia> I Guess i'Ll just bind
[12:54:01] <prometh> $("menu > li > div > button").on("click", function(event)
[12:54:02] <prometh> {
[12:54:02] <prometh> 	expandListItem( $(this).parent().parent().next().index() );
[12:54:02] <prometh> 	
[12:54:02] <prometh> 	event.stopPropagation();
[12:54:02] <prometh> });
[12:54:12] <eddiemonge> mutedia: are you using jquery 1.7.x?
[12:54:27] <mutedia> 1.7.1
[12:54:28] <Whirl3d> prometh, try using .on attached to the parent container
[12:54:45] <prometh> ahhh
[12:54:47] <prometh> :)
[12:54:54] <Whirl3d> $("menu").on("click",function (e) {var btn=$(e.target);});
[12:55:01] <prometh> right.. tahnks
[12:55:25] <Whirl3d> Then you can add and delete and reorder your buttons as necessary without any other coding, it's all handled by the parent container
[12:55:36] <prometh> and less memory used
[12:56:03] <JAAulde> Why is my attempt to call `.button()` (from UI) on a checkbox input causing an error? http://jsfiddle.net/g8SLa/ I am calling it the same way as the docs: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[12:56:28] <eddiemonge> ? demo @ mutedia
[12:56:28] <bot-t> mutedia, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:57:03] <ajpiano> JAAulde: i would try inserting the input into the DOM before calling button on it
[12:57:18] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I did that too...same thing...  Lemme updateb my fiddle
[12:57:29] <mutedia> k, 2 sec
[12:57:30] <ajpiano> JAAulde: also try the latest jquery ui
[12:57:34] <ajpiano> 1.8.17
[12:58:54] <Whirl3d> when I update to jquerymobile 1.01, my mobile content is tiny. Anything I need to do to resize the content for jqmobile 1.01?
[12:59:35] <Whirl3d> http://www.bharveylawfirm.com/mobile/test.html (using old jqmobile)
[12:59:54] <Whirl3d> http://www.bharveylawfirm.com/mobile/index.html (using new jqmobile)
[13:00:27] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: they look identical to me in desktop chrome...
[13:00:31] <JAAulde> ajpiano: hmm, http://jsfiddle.net/g8SLa/2/ has the append first, and the error goes away (although it did not on my site). However, it does not buttonize even though the error is gone. I will keep poking
[13:00:41] <Whirl3d> yeah, on a mobile device is where the problem is.
[13:01:03] <Whirl3d> the mobile device for test.html looks much better (not so tiny)
[13:01:43] <Whirl3d> It's probably something stupid on my part, but I was hoping someone knew off hand. I'll keep looking. Thanks for your help ajpiano
[13:01:56] <ajpiano> yeah sorry i haven't a bloody clue
[13:03:02] <eddiemonge> prometh: is this what you were trying to accomplish: http://jsfiddle.net/mFAUA/
[13:03:12] <Surrealis> im trying to select:  the text in a cell in the first cell of the same tr trDisabled.find('td:first').text();
[13:03:41] <prometh> eddiemonge: sort of, but not entirely.. thank you, though... i will learn from it :)
[13:04:04] <mutedia> http://jsfiddle.net/RHejy/2/   it doesn't work there but it works locally
[13:04:14] <prometh> very clean code
[13:04:18] <mutedia> since jsfiddle doesn't like dynamic append
[13:04:20] <xkcp7d_> can someone give a link to that cool firebug debugging stuff?
[13:04:23] <eddiemonge> prometh: what does it not do?
[13:04:26] <xkcp7d_> I know the bot has it or something
[13:04:37] <prometh> eddiemonge: some things that I had not delved into here
[13:05:05] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: looks fine on iphone
[13:05:19] <eddiemonge> prometh: it does what your description implied
[13:05:29] <eddiemonge> but you can use it as a starting point
[13:05:31] <prometh> yes, and i am learning from it
[13:05:37] <eddiemonge> although it could be further optimized
[13:05:51] <prometh> it's more of a starting point... it shows me how to write jquery like i write plain js
[13:06:16] <mutedia> missing header, duh
[13:06:35] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: oh, you need to set your meta viewport
[13:06:41] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, the new version (mobile/index.html) is tiny and when you zoom in, click an anchor element, it zooms back out.
[13:06:59] <Whirl3d> Great! Thanks a lot eddiemonge. Like how?
[13:07:06] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

[13:07:39] <Mainmam> I'll just buy the montly photoshop subscription
[13:07:40] <JAAulde> Ok, ajpiano, I see it is working on latest UI when appending first, then runnign button.
[13:07:43] <Mainmam> fyi
[13:07:57] <JAAulde> My live site is not up to date and won't be for a bit, so I'll have to do something else
[13:07:59] <ajpiano> JAAulde: ya, 1.8.16 works with 1.6.4 and 1.8.17 is for jquery 1.7.1
[13:08:01] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, thanks tons. that fixed it!
[13:08:14] <JAAulde> ajpiano: thanks
[13:09:49] <eddiemonge> mutedia: http://jsfiddle.net/RHejy/8/
[13:10:22] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: you should really read the changelog notes
[13:10:30] <xckpd7> eddiemonge: bro you rock
[13:10:41] <mrgreenfur> I've assigned a method to the click even via .click({blah}), is there a way to see what was assigned? Something like $('foo').events('click') ?
[13:10:50] <Whirl3d> Cool. Will do. This is my first attempt. I was gonna check there next. You saved me a lot of time. Thanks.
[13:11:08] <eddiemonge> xckpd7: those are ajpiano's slides
[13:11:57] <mrgreenfur> nm, found on stackoverflow :)
[13:11:58] <prometh> eddiemonge: would you say it's a good or bad idea to have only 1 event listener on the <menu> ?
[13:11:58] <xckpd7> ajpiano: you rock bro
[13:12:05] <prometh> then use e.target to figure otu what's been clicked
[13:12:11] <eddiemonge> mrgreenfur: .data("events")
[13:12:18] <mrgreenfur> eddiemonge: ah, tha'ts simpler. thanks!
[13:12:39] <eddiemonge> prometh: depends on the element, what you want it to do, the listener, etc etc
[13:12:54] <prometh> i'd like to listen for the <li>'s and the <button>'s
[13:13:22] <eddiemonge> prometh: id attach listeners to those instead of doing it on the menu and figuring out what has been clicked
[13:14:09] <prometh> i was thinking that, cuz finding exactly which element has been clicked by sifting through children/grandchildren/etc is annoying
[13:14:12] <mutedia> hey thanks eddie
[13:14:24] <mutedia> I'm not sure why it wasn'T working the way I was doing it, this seems better
[13:14:25] <prometh> and inefficient use of cpu
[13:14:42] <prometh> but it's great cuz if the contents changed, it still works
[13:15:25] <WebDragon> is there a way to cause an iframe to be able to stretch to contain its changing content height-wise ?
[13:15:33] <eddiemonge> mutedia: i have no idea what you were trying to do. it looked almost like delegation but wasnt quite
[13:16:06] <mutedia> well, I start off with $(document).on("pagecreate"
[13:16:06] <WebDragon> I know that regular frameset's can be assigned with * for the px height, but iframes are fixed-height normally
[13:16:14] <mutedia> isn't that standard practice ?
[13:16:20] <eddiemonge> prometh: cpu usage for something like this is tiny
[13:16:36] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: only if its from the same domain
[13:16:45] <WebDragon> I need one to be able to stretch to accommodate content so a vertical scrollbar is prevented for some if the framed content that gets loaded
[13:16:56] <prometh> not if i have to loop through everything and its parents
[13:16:57] <eddiemonge> mutedia: is this a jqm project?
[13:17:03] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: but if it's from a separate domain then it cannot be done ?
[13:17:15] <prometh> it slows things down, especially if other stuff is going on
[13:17:17] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: nope because you dont know the contents
[13:17:21] <mutedia> yeah it is a jqm project
[13:17:28] <WebDragon> no way of client-side detecting that it's had to create a scrollbar for the content and resizing it accordingly?
[13:17:44] <eddiemonge> prometh: then your other sutff should be optimized because this stuff is not a big performance hit
[13:17:48] <Mainmam> is the purpose of "window." to make variables set inside of functions available outside of functions?
[13:17:57] <eddiemonge> mutedia: is the audio added after the page is created?
[13:18:07] <prometh> other stuff might be more rendering slow down
[13:18:14] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: but you DO know that you've had to create scrollbars to present the framed content. .. I wonder if that's detectable cleint-side
[13:18:29] <prometh> if everything is 100% efficient, then there's room for more goodness
[13:18:33] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: no. thats inside the frame
[13:18:44] <WebDragon> aw crap
[13:18:48] <mutedia> not the actual files but I have to populate a playlist
[13:18:52] <jhally> ciao
[13:18:55] <jhally> !list
[13:19:13] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: you seem knowledgable about this -- can you tell me whether min-height, max-height works on iframes ?
[13:20:04] <danzik17> prometh: stop worrying about premature optimization.  write your app so it's correct, then optimize only what needs it.
[13:20:13] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: not for their parent containers
[13:20:25] <prometh> danzik17: i'm just thinking ahead
[13:20:32] <eddiemonge> mutedia: as long as the player is there then you dont need to bind it pagecreate
[13:20:42] <eddiemonge> mutedia: if you are only changing the source
[13:20:47] <eddiemonge> but im not entirely sure
[13:21:00] <mutedia> well i will be changing the source, I'm making a timer
[13:21:19] * WebDragon is once again forced to wishing he were there at the time these things were cobbled together so that they could have been done more flexibly and sensibly
[13:21:24] <mutedia> I know jqm is different because of how the page structure is and I'Ve only been doing this for a few weeks and everything has been jqm specific
[13:21:30] <WebDragon> ah well, thanks eddiemonge
[13:21:59] <WebDragon> hey wait,what about from the other side
[13:22:18] <WebDragon> can jquery on the other side of the iframe do anything about its height in an iframe on another site ?
[13:23:43] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: if you have access to the html of the other site then you can set the cross browser flag or something like that i think
[13:29:38] <Mainmam> is there a reason to use the Number function if the result will already be a number?
[13:29:51] <Mainmam> i dunno why in the sam-blue-hell this guy in the tut is using the number function
[13:30:29] <E1ephant> blue hell
[13:30:32] <E1ephant> lol
[13:34:20] <fomatin> hey
[13:34:31] <fomatin> i'm trying to use a click binding but it's not working
[13:35:52] <fomatin> http://pastebin.com/kYm44ALb that's what I'm using
[13:40:04] <devOlsen_> there's a name from the past, how goes it WebDragon.
[13:41:05] <WebDragon> heya :D ltns
[13:42:47] <WebDragon> what's new devOlsen_ ?
[13:43:23] <eddiemonge> Mainmam: what guy where?
[13:43:31] <devOlsen_> not a lot, trying to work out a complicated lightbox that has 4 different media types and a sub teir of media under 1 of the 4 types.
[13:43:35] <devOlsen_> you know, fun times.
[13:43:49] <devOlsen_> also two interaction points (thumbnails and toggle arrows..)
[13:43:55] <eddiemonge> fomatin: is the click binding not working or the animate?
[13:44:04] <fomatin> animate works fine
[13:44:12] <fomatin> eddiemonge: but the click doesn't bind
[13:44:17] <fomatin> works perfect in jsFiddle
[13:44:19] <WebDragon> devOlsen_: heh ohyeah fun times
[13:44:22] <eddiemonge> fomatin: how you do know?
[13:44:42] <fomatin> in the chrome javascript console, i ran both of them
[13:44:43] <WebDragon> devOlsen_: just finished up a wordpress + magento + jquery ecommerce and portfolio site at www.thinkaesthetica.com
[13:44:43] <eddiemonge> fomatin: do you have an element with an id of close_vote in your DOM?
[13:45:19] <fomatin> yeah an img
[13:45:23] <fomatin> in the vote_box div
[13:45:34] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ fomatin
[13:45:35] <bot-t> fomatin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:45:46] <devOlsen_> :( but no html5 WebDragon.
[13:45:59] <devOlsen_> I mean converting magento to html5 should be both fun and easy...
[13:46:04] <devOlsen_> (that was a huge joke btw.)
[13:46:25] <eddiemonge> devOlsen_: nothing about magento is fun or easy. thats nothing to joke about
[13:46:28] <WebDragon> devOlsen_: no, magento's still on xhtml 1.0
[13:46:40] <devOlsen_> ... face palm.
[13:46:43] <eddiemonge> i seriously hate pastebin.com
[13:47:00] <devOlsen_> WebDragon, this looks nice man.
[13:47:02] <WebDragon> devOlsen_: I've got some plans for the phase2 but hadn't the time to implement them in phase1 -- had enough trouble getting the site to behave like the client's PSD's and expectations
[13:47:09] <fomatin> the problem is that it works perfectly in jsfiddle
[13:47:15] <WebDragon> magento's a bear -- makes wordpress look like a chewing gum wrapper around html+css
[13:47:27] <devOlsen_> Tell me about it.
[13:47:31] <eddiemonge> fomatin: then something else is wrong with your page. live link?
[13:47:42] <fomatin> um
[13:47:44] <fomatin> let me push
[13:47:47] <devOlsen_> I started making video tutorials for my self in the magento days just to keep my bookmarks count down.
[13:48:40] <fomatin> eddiemonge: http://finchly.com/
[13:48:40] <blacksonblondes> i can't get this work properly..how can u make it better?
[13:48:40] <blacksonblondes> $("div").html("8====D");
[13:49:07] <devOlsen_> WebDragon, http://tinyurl.com/7ca3cxo check that out.
[13:49:41] <devOlsen_> It's a little slow due to their implementation CMS guidlines and their temp server they put it on for phase one, but in phase two we should have it on a better hosting here soon.
[13:49:50] <eddiemonge> fomatin: you need a see ? ready
[13:49:50] <bot-t> fomatin, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:50:06] <eddiemonge> there is no #close_vote when you are calling it
[13:50:09] <fomatin> oh derp
[13:50:35] <eddiemonge> blacksonblondes: are you asking for a ban?
[13:50:48] <fomatin> thank you
[13:50:49] <WebDragon> devOlsen_: I recommend making < Regions vs < Global more obvious once you've clicked inwards
[13:50:51] <WebDragon> looks great though
[13:50:59] <WebDragon> runs nice and smooth here on Opera 11.61
[13:51:40] <blacksonblondes> eddiemonge...ban me and ur internet connection will be gone for 15 min
[13:51:43] <WebDragon> took me a click to realize that <Back to Overview was the wrong thing to click to 'go back'
[13:51:48] <devOlsen_> lol that was todays update WebDragon.
[13:51:48] <WebDragon> =)
[13:51:54] <devOlsen_> going to be pushed live monday.
[13:52:01] <devOlsen_> we do not push on fridays :)
[13:52:10] <WebDragon> myself I think that the <back to global should be added to the bottom nest of arrows
[13:52:15] <fomatin> thanks guys
[13:52:23] <fomatin> oh and feel free to continue to the vote page haha
[13:52:27] <devOlsen_> yeah, that would be the creative team / ux team's call.
[13:52:29] <eddiemonge> blacksonblondes: are you just trolling or wtf?
[13:52:33] <WebDragon> that's where I'd look for it -- concentrate the nav in specific locations rather than in multiple places
[13:52:38] <WebDragon> usability !
[13:52:42] <WebDragon> instinct!
[13:52:47] <WebDragon> take advantage of it!
[13:52:49] <WebDragon> =)
[13:52:50] * WebDragon runs
[13:52:57] <devOlsen_> yeah we have a full UX team that is re-hauling this all phone phase two.
[13:53:23] <WebDragon> feel free to pass on my suggestion if it makes sense to you
[13:53:31] <devOlsen_> word
[13:53:42] <WebDragon> frakk. outta cigs
[13:53:49] <WebDragon> meh }B=&\
[13:54:25] <devOlsen_> haha
[13:54:32] <devOlsen_> oh, damn I'm down to 2
[13:54:43] <mrgt> Looking to create (ideally) slpine (or line) graphs in the front-end for a web app powered by php and mysql backend. Should support x and y axis labelling and different levels of granularity. Anyone know of any good APIs or libraries or etc. that provides this?
[13:54:52] <WebDragon> LOL long day for both of us it seems
[13:55:24] <WebDragon> chatzilla. O_O
[13:55:32] <eddiemonge> mrgt: you mean like highcharts (?maybe) or dojo or yui or extjs?
[13:55:32] <devOlsen_> haha
[13:55:33] <WebDragon> you know opera's got ircclient built in, right?
[13:55:41] <eddiemonge> and torrent
[13:55:50] <WebDragon> and email,and news
[13:55:50] <eddiemonge> and miketaylr
[13:55:58] <miketaylr> :D
[13:55:59] <WebDragon> I dunno how they got their browser install footprint smaller than firefox
[13:56:08] <WebDragon> boggles my mind
[13:56:27] <mutedia> it is firefox after all
[13:56:32] <mrgt> eddiemonge: yeah, exactly like highcharts - but preferably an alternative that's free..
[13:57:09] <devOlsen_> Anyways, so yeah WebDragon, the most impressive part about that map is the highpolygon file for country poly drawing.
[13:57:20] <devOlsen_> I got that file down to 217kb from 2.6mb.
[13:57:21] * WebDragon fails miserably trying to come up with a punnish way to insinuate that firefox is overweight
[13:57:36] <WebDragon> wat
[13:57:39] <WebDragon> nice!
[13:57:46] <WebDragon> s/wat/what
[13:57:59] <WebDragon> sprites?
[13:58:12] <WebDragon> won't it be great when you can just draw on canvas ? :D
[13:58:29] <devOlsen_> yeah, use this long/lat predictive algorithm that encodes long lats into binary, then cuts it in half and spits out base64 version of polygon vert points.
[13:58:42] <devOlsen_> thus 217kb of what would be 2.6mb.
[13:59:03] <WebDragon> http://koti.kapsi.fi/csmr/fermats-spiral.html?pars=22777,6pt,1,t,t,77,177,f,f,f
[13:59:22] <WebDragon> someone pasted that in (I think) #html5 the other day
[13:59:31] <devOlsen_> epic.
[14:00:20] <WebDragon> I like the seed radius at 4pt myself
[14:01:33] <WebDragon> you get some nice moiré effect at 1pt though
[14:01:48] <devOlsen_> 24pt for everybody!
[14:02:09] <Vorspire> polygons? o3d

[14:04:35] <illourr> can anyone tell me that plugin that lets you make like powerpoint slides in web and colors your code nicely????
[14:05:48] <devOlsen_> looks cool Vorspire, I was referring to gmap's polygons.
[14:05:51] <WebDragon> google docs? :D
[14:05:55] * WebDragon runs 
[14:06:01] <devOlsen_> ahem?
[14:06:10] <WebDragon> ^ to illourr
[14:06:11] <devOlsen_> Must I point out how well it stands up to magento docs?
[14:06:14] <devOlsen_> don't get me started.
[14:06:24] <WebDragon> lol
[14:06:32] <WebDragon> magento docs?what magento docs
[14:06:35] <WebDragon> where?
[14:06:43] <devOlsen_> My point exactly
[14:06:48] * WebDragon gets on his soapbox
[14:06:58] <WebDragon> THE CODE IS NOT THE DOCUMENTATION
[14:07:01] <devOlsen_> if any at all, it is found through googles services haha
[14:07:04] <eddiemonge> when did this become a magento room?
[14:07:05] <devOlsen_> so google wins again.
[14:07:05] * WebDragon steps back down
[14:07:33] <devOlsen_> when all other conversation died down eddiemonge.
[14:07:36] <WebDragon> still, I was facetiously answering illourr's question about a plugin that lets you make powerpoint slides on web with "google docs"
[14:08:01] <WebDragon> since that's worthy of a "that was easy" buttonpress
[14:08:13] <illourr> ive seen something that was specificly made for code samples also
[14:08:25] <devOlsen_> I hesitate to use anymore of google services with out searching first..
[14:08:28] <WebDragon> mmm never seen it myself
[14:08:38] <devOlsen_> this whole (we now charge for large use of our maps) back in oct is not cool.
[14:09:06] <WebDragon> depends on how much it was being abused
[14:09:11] <illourr> its used for like prentation in html css jquery..
[14:26:50] <prometh> if i have $("li") .. how can i later get index 1?
[14:27:03] <prometh> get(1) seems to give me the html node, not the jquery object
[14:27:29] <danzik17> prometh: see ?eq
[14:27:30] <bot-t> prometh, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:27:41] <prometh> great, tahnk you
[14:28:05] <Mainmam> ok, serious question
[14:28:43] <acidjazz> yo im using xmlhttprequest and FileReader() and im in the onloadend callback .. lookking for my response from the server .. any1 know where that is?
[14:29:05] <Mainmam> why do you need to use the number() function to make the resulting values usable in functions when the values are already numbers?
[14:33:16] <dabear_> Mainmam: Number() converts text strings to numbers
[14:33:38] <dabear_> so does +foo too
[14:33:50] <dabear_> ?eval typeof "34"
[14:33:51] <bot-t> dabear_: "string"
[14:33:55] <dabear_> ?eval typeof +"34"
[14:33:56] <bot-t> dabear_: "number"
[14:35:15] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: i understand half of what you said but it makes no sense to me in the rest of the context. please ask betterly
[14:35:37] <Mainmam> dabear: i just realized that the reason values weren't working without "number()" was because I forgot to remove its parenthesis :P
[14:35:53] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: have you used html5's new XMLHttpRequest() ?
[14:35:59] <acidjazz> w/ like FileReader(); ?
[14:36:09] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: where can i find the response data after you send a file?
[14:36:34] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: where is $() ? im confused
[14:36:56] <acidjazz> i know i know its not a jq question
[14:37:09] <acidjazz> ive already asked everywhere else
[14:37:51] <eddiemonge> did you ask in #html5?
[14:37:58] <acidjazz> yeap
[14:38:00] <acidjazz> in there now
[14:38:27] <eddiemonge> Technologies often called part of HTML5 that aren't
[14:38:27] <eddiemonge> WebGL
[14:38:27] <eddiemonge> FileReader
[14:38:27] <eddiemonge> XMLHttpRequest
[14:38:39] <prometh> what is the best way to apply some kind of variable to an element? i'd like to avoid using attributes as it's non-standard html
[14:38:50] <eddiemonge> ?data @ prometh
[14:38:51] <bot-t> prometh, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:38:56] <prometh> cool, thanks
[14:39:25] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: i read about it from html5rocks.com
[14:39:52] <prometh> html5 currently sucks
[14:40:02] <prometh> as does webgl
[14:40:15] <prometh> sure, they are a big part of the future of the web... but that's far off
[14:40:33] <prometh> and flash will always be better for games
[14:40:43] <eddiemonge> html5 doesnt suck. its here now and doing well
[14:41:02] <prometh> html4 with an html doctype, sure
[14:41:05] <prometh> html5 doctype, rather
[14:41:22] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: did you read http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/ if you are going to stick with that site?
[14:41:31] <prometh> menu tags
[14:41:34] <prometh> but html5 forms? no
[14:41:49] <prometh> which is the biggest thing for me in html5
[14:41:51] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with html5 forms?
[14:41:58] <prometh> they're not fully implemented everywhere
[14:42:05] <eddiemonge> neither is anything
[14:42:12] <prometh> which is why html5 currently sucks
[14:42:27] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: why dont we debate which browser i read that in?
[14:42:32] <eddiemonge> in that case, html4, xml, json, flash all suck too
[14:42:40] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: huh?
[14:42:43] <prometh> html5's best stuff isn't usable yet
[14:42:48] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: think about what i just asked you
[14:42:50] <eddiemonge> prometh: like what?
[14:42:53] <ajpiano> prometh: that doesn't mean you should eschew things that do work
[14:42:54] <prometh> forms.
[14:42:55] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: if you dont get it keep thinking
[14:43:02] <ajpiano> data attributes work just fine
[14:43:07] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: no thank you. ill just move on
[14:43:09] <prometh> ajpiano: what works in html5 that's important?
[14:43:38] <eddiemonge> forms, tags, doctype
[14:43:41] <prometh> but that's just html4 with an attribute
[14:43:48] <ajpiano> video works really nicely in a lot of places
[14:43:52] <prometh> the meat of html5 isn't ready yet
[14:43:54] <eddiemonge> prometh: http://html5please.us/
[14:43:56] <prometh> html5 video lags like crap
[14:44:50] <eddiemonge> all html5 videos ive watched have been smoother than flash and work every place ive tried/needed them
[14:45:29] <prometh> for me, it's been the reverse
[14:46:07] <eddiemonge> ?modernizr @ prometh
[14:46:08] <bot-t> prometh, a feature detection javascript library that determines support for all sorts of html5 and css3 goodness. http://modernizr.com
[14:46:36] <ajpiano> prometh: the basic approaches to storing arbitary data on elements amount to completely arbitrary nonstandard attributes, html5 data- attributes, or shoving it into some specced attribute and reading it from there and just magically knowing that you happen to be using the alt attribute, or whatever
[14:46:56] <prometh> i'm still gonna wait on html5
[14:47:12] <ajpiano> see you in a decade then!!
[14:47:13] <prometh> the biggest thing for me are the forms... multiple file uploads, date, color
[14:47:37] <ajpiano> you can use it and polyfill it on older browsers if you want
[14:47:55] <prometh> inconsistent styling too, though
[14:48:03] <ajpiano> or you can just be like, "html5 is a gigantic monolith and i'm taking all or none"
[14:48:14] <prometh> i use whaat's available in css3
[14:48:17] <prometh> don't get me wrong
[14:48:38] <ajpiano> so what's the problem with doing data-whatever
[14:48:39] <prometh> it's just what i need from html5 isn't fully available yet
[14:48:41] <ajpiano> it will literally work everwhere
[14:48:45] <prometh> data's cool
[14:48:49] <ajpiano> oh then fine
[14:49:18] <prometh> it's just not really what i'd label as "html5"
[14:49:33] <prometh> technically it is, but it's so minute
[14:49:54] <prometh> i'm a designer at the core, though... so perhaps my perspective is different
[14:50:09] <eddiemonge> by different do you mean wrong ;)  ?
[14:50:24] <prometh> haha
[14:50:35] <prometh> i can't think of a good response to that :)
[14:50:44] <prometh> eithier than "no".. which sucks
[14:51:32] <eddiemonge> if you find yourself arguing with ajpiano you are probably wrong
[14:51:42] <ajpiano> heh
[14:51:57] <eddiemonge> unless "you" is me and by me i mean eddiemonge, in which case "you" is probably righ
[14:51:59] <prometh> not really arguing facts.. just emotion
[14:51:59] <ajpiano> i think his remarks came in the context of a lot of the other discussion about some of the filereader stuf, etc.
[14:52:08] <ajpiano> so whatever, it's no big deal
[14:52:28] <ajpiano> which definitely is way less ready for prime time unless you have very specific targets
[14:52:29] <prometh> using one aspect of html5 doesn't feel like using html5 to me
[14:52:51] <ajpiano> that's kind of a weird perspective though, but i guess it doesn't matter
[14:53:00] <prometh> :)
[14:53:05] <eddiemonge> if youre page starts with <doctype HTML> then you are using HTML5. congrats!
[14:53:07] <prometh> i am awesome.
[14:53:12] <danzik17> ajpiano: what aspect of the filereader isn't good?  besides the MS being behind the curve, yet again.
[14:53:14] <ajpiano> one doesn't use all of a technology to be using said technology :p
[14:53:21] <prometh> eddiemonge: and a lot of pretentious people do just that, though
[14:53:27] <ajpiano> danzik17: exactly
[14:53:28] <eddiemonge> prometh: and .... ?
[14:53:34] <prometh> eddiemonge: it's sad
[14:53:41] <prometh> not saying you fit into taht category
[14:53:54] <eddiemonge> i do
[14:53:55] <prometh> it's just there are a lot of pretentious people out there
[14:53:56] <eddiemonge> and i am
[14:54:01] <prometh> then you are wrong :P
[14:54:07] <eddiemonge> prometh: do you use every part of javascript?
[14:54:13] <prometh> many
[14:54:15] <prometh> not just a script tag
[14:54:31] <ajpiano> wat
[14:54:51] <prometh> i'm saying that there are a lot of pretentious people there merely using the html5 doctype
[14:54:53] <prometh> trying to sound smarter than they are
[14:54:55] <prometh> and it's sad
[14:55:06] <eddiemonge> prometh: better example, do you use every part of html4?
[14:55:16] <prometh> many
[14:55:18] <prometh> not just a doctype
[14:55:19] <ajpiano> this is a really pointless discussion
[14:55:25] <eddiemonge> it really is
[14:55:26] <prometh> ajpiano: it's my opinion
[14:55:35] <prometh> so if you guys don't wanna hear it, ok
[14:55:37] <ajpiano> ?offtopic your opinion
[14:55:37] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of your opinion is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[14:55:44] <ajpiano> :p
[14:55:53] <prometh> bot-t is wrong
[14:56:04] <prometh> alright, back to work for me :)
[14:56:10] <ajpiano> me too :)
[14:56:22] <eddiemonge> bot-t is never wrong, except when bot-t is wrong. then bot-t gets fixed
[14:57:01] <mutedia> it seems to be bot-t isn'T just a bot but a megaphone
[14:57:27] <David_Bradbury> So I know you can do ($("#blah").length >= 1) to see if something with that id exists, but is there anything more elegant?
[14:57:44] <chrisinajar> Hi. I'm using $.getScript to load some scripts. When the success function runs often the code in the script has not run yet, is there any way around that?
[14:57:45] <pifantastic> what is more elegant than that?
[14:58:00] <pifantastic> if ($('#blah').length)
[14:58:04] <pifantastic> no need for the >= 1
[14:58:07] <ajpiano> var ballet = {}; ballet.element = $("#blah"); if (ballet.element.length) { }
[14:58:11] <David_Bradbury> Maybe $("#blah").exists?
[14:58:12] <ajpiano> ^^ i put it into a ballet
[14:58:15] <ajpiano> now it is very elegant
[14:58:16] <David_Bradbury> True
[14:58:18] <David_Bradbury> Haha
[14:58:20] <Vorspire> lmao
[14:58:25] <pifantastic> ajpiano++
[14:58:52] <pifantastic> chrisinajar: maybe you should consider using a more robust script loader like yepnope
[14:58:56] <pifantastic> or LABjs
[15:00:18] <eddiemonge> pifantastic: i always include the  > 0
[15:00:27] <chrisinajar> me too, eddie
[15:00:40] <ajpiano> i never do
[15:00:47] <ajpiano> which is strange because i believe in fairies and ghost
[15:00:55] <ajpiano> which is essentially what always using the > 0 amounts to
[15:00:55] <ajpiano> :D
[15:00:56] <David_Bradbury> For me, it depends on how it reads
[15:01:00] <David_Bradbury> Heh
[15:01:26] <eddiemonge> i believe one time i used "if (ballet.element.length) {}" it fired even though there was no ballet.element
[15:01:36] <David_Bradbury> I try to find a decent alliance between clarity and brevity
[15:01:37] <eddiemonge> and from then on ...
[15:01:41] <David_Bradbury> Heh
[15:01:50] <David_Bradbury> err
[15:01:56] <eddiemonge> its like that one time i got food poisoning at KFC. never again. never. again.
[15:02:07] <ajpiano> David_Bradbury: if you consider the fact that if () and && and || only care if something is truthy , not true
[15:02:09] <David_Bradbury> s/balance/alliance/
[15:02:13] <theBrettman> $_POST is an associative array, right?
[15:02:16] <ajpiano> then you realise that passing a number is a reasonable thing to do
[15:02:19] <theBrettman> not an object?
[15:02:27] <David_Bradbury> Yup yup
[15:02:35] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: its a function
[15:02:40] <David_Bradbury> gah
[15:02:46] <theBrettman> a function? it is not!
[15:02:46] <ajpiano> he's talking about php :/
[15:02:47] <eddiemonge> of you said _ not .
[15:02:50] <theBrettman> it's a variable
[15:02:59] <David_Bradbury> s/"s/balance/alliance/"/"s/alliance/balance/"
[15:03:04] <theBrettman> containing an associative array, not an object
[15:03:21] <theBrettman> yet $wpdb->insert() wants an object
[15:03:34] <theBrettman> y did wordpress make this such a pain?
[15:03:39] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: that is so crazily off topic
[15:03:47] <eddiemonge> PHP, wordpress. what does it all mean???
[15:03:58] <theBrettman> how is that not on topic?
[15:04:17] <ajpiano> this is the #jQuery channel not the #anythingrelatedtomakingwebsites channe;l
[15:04:45] <David_Bradbury> #jquery != (#wordpress || ##php)
[15:04:49] <theBrettman> I want to use $wpdb->insert() but obv, I can't just do $wpdb->insert($table, $_POST);
[15:05:03] <eddiemonge> and on it goes
[15:05:07] <theBrettman> oh crap, I'm in the wrong room
[15:05:09] <theBrettman> lol
[15:05:13] <theBrettman> damnit
[15:05:14] <eddiemonge> thats what we are saying
[15:05:36] <theBrettman> all these irc channels look the same!
[15:06:07] <Vorspire> time for a theme change
[15:06:32] <eddiemonge> theBrettman: read http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#INSERT_rows
[15:20:44] <danzik17> any idea how you could feature detect chrome's capability to provide image data during a paste event?   trying like hell not to use UA sniffing for this.
[15:40:22] <savid> Hi, I'm using the jquery-ui $.sortable() plugin.  I can't seem to figure out how to get the element relative to where I've "dropped" the sorted item.
[15:40:55] <savid> it seems that event.srcElement and event.toElement don't contain what I need.
[15:45:23] <eddiemonge> savid: have you tried console.log(event)?
[15:47:02] <z1000> anyone worked with any good pagination plugins
[15:48:28] <nFFF> z1000 why can't you make your own?
[15:48:46] <z1000> is it easy?
[15:49:06] <nFFF> I can't see what the issue is
[15:49:12] <nFFF> just a bunch of ajax calls
[15:49:26] <z1000> nFFF, its not even for me
[15:51:32] <Jonno_FTW> how can I make a form which has table rows addClass the table row when a form element in that row is changed?
[15:53:41] <nFFF> Jonno_FTW jsfiddle.net
[15:54:27] <Jonno_FTW> nFFF: I'll do it a different way, I'll just add a class to the form elements, and iterate through each table row, checking the form elements
[15:55:29] <ShaunR> i'm passing data attributes to my dialog using a button .data($(this).data()).dialog("open"); and i can use the data in the ajax but i want to use the data in the success: section of the ajax but cant seam to figure out how to access it.  Anybody know how?
[15:56:14] <ShaunR> $(this).data('accountid'); is what i'm using in the ajax({ data: }) section and that works fine, just cant use that in the success: area.
[15:57:27] <nFFF> ShaunR
[15:58:00] <ShaunR> nFFF: yes?
[15:59:10] <eddiemonge> ?paste @ ShaunR
[15:59:11] <bot-t> ShaunR, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:00:10] <nFFF> How are we suppose to relate anything you said to real code example? :|
[16:00:17] <fourcolors> hi. I'm using jQuery UI autocomplete and was wondering if there is a way to change the structure of each widget that the user selects? For instance, I want to add a profile photo and an image tag to the list they select users from
[16:02:55] <fourcolors> found a great example here. http://jsfiddle.net/K5q5U/ thanks :)
[16:03:10] <solidus-river> anyone know how to disable horizontal scroll bars using jscrollpane?
[16:03:55] <z1000> solidus-river, is that the best way to do it?
[16:04:19] <Jonno_FTW> what is the difference between selecting "a b" and "a > b" ?
[16:04:28] <solidus-river> jscrollpane? no way, but when your employer insists you have special window, untill webkit browsers that support scroll bar theming, its pretty much your only option
[16:04:33] <ShaunR> there you go http://jsfiddle.net/bpv2F/
[16:04:46] <solidus-river> wow that was very fragmented, i need less caffiene in me
[16:04:55] <nFFF> solidus-river how about css?
[16:04:56] <oojacoboo> is there anyway to set a breakpoint on a a redirect?
[16:04:59] <ShaunR> ("#row_accountid_" + data('accountid')).hide(); is what i'm looking at
[16:05:10] <nFFF> you can hide horizontal and vertical scrolls in plain css
[16:05:47] <solidus-river> nFFF: yeah, jscrollpain overrides that, themable scroll bars are a horrible horrible idea untill they are supported in css
[16:05:59] <solidus-river> nFFF: i'm really pissed at facebook and google for using them early, setting a bad example
[16:06:38] <eddiemonge> fourcolors: you know the demos have an example already right?
[16:07:02] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: wasn't able to find it. I find the documentation hard to read in general however
[16:07:17] <eddiemonge> Jonno_FTW: "a b" means find all b in a. "a > b" means find all b that are immediate children of a
[16:07:29] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: which example?
[16:07:31] <eddiemonge> Jonno_FTW: basic CSS selector syntax
[16:07:57] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: nm found it
[16:08:29] <Jonno_FTW> edithanks, I'd just never read an proper explanation of it before
[16:08:40] <fourcolors> I really think they shouldn't have just an "example" but something in the docs that actually states, hey this is what you can do.
[16:09:01] <Jonno_FTW> yeah
[16:09:39] <Jonno_FTW> how can I check if any of an elements children have a certain class?
[16:09:53] <zatan> Hi, can anyone help me to loop through this elements correctly as I dont understand how to do it ;/ http://jsfiddle.net/xfdp5/
[16:09:56] <Jonno_FTW> or do I have to iterate over the children?
[16:10:54] <nFFF> Jonno_FTW $('ele > child').find('class')
[16:11:33] <eddiemonge> fourcolors: this is hard to read: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data  ?
[16:12:02] <Jonno_FTW> thanks
[16:12:06] <eddiemonge> ?filter @ Jonno_FTW
[16:12:07] <bot-t> Jonno_FTW, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[16:12:15] <eddiemonge> nFFF: that should be filter, not find
[16:13:30] <nFFF> eddiemonge why?
[16:13:32] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: yes because it talks about "selecting" items but nothing about formatting what is being selected. Says stuff like "overriding the default focus and selection actions"
[16:13:59] <eddiemonge> fourcolors: did you click viewsource?
[16:14:45] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: yes :) I understand it's there in the view source. I'm just saying they should have it documented and have the source
[16:15:00] <eddiemonge> nFFF: $('ele > child').find('class') will find items with "class" that are descendants of child. not find child that has class
[16:16:11] <nFFF> Yes, sorry misread
[16:16:11] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: just for the simple folk like me.
[16:17:41] <eddiemonge> ShaunR: http://jsfiddle.net/bpv2F/3/
[16:17:51] <eddiemonge> zatan: use a for loop
[16:18:17] <eddiemonge> fourcolors: its overriding the default render function. most simple folk are not doing that
[16:19:08] <fourcolors> eddiemonge: lol not sure if thats a complement or a "stop being a retard" comment. But that works.
[16:20:08] <eddiemonge> its a "the documentation is written for the test cases most people will use. There are also advanced topics for the people that need it (if they need it, they should already understand the topics that it will cover)"
[16:21:44] <fourcolors> hum.. see I disagree with that. I think documentation should be easy to understand and written for all levels. But starting with the basics is a good start.
[16:22:45] <Vorspire> imo code should be written with appropriate naming convention in order to self-document - but this approach can't always be applied to JS
[16:22:59] <jowop> hello! on line 30 i am calling validationEngine on a form that has been loaded in via ajax. even though the validationEngine is called, the fields are not validated. http://pastebin.com/a6BF9xSU
[16:24:48] <fourcolors> Vorspire: I agree there. But I still don't think documentation should ever be left out. I mean I don't want to have to open the source up even time I'm like ok what can this plugin do etc. Even though I can do that. It's much easier to just look at the docs imo
[16:25:53] <fourcolors> Sorry not meaning to start an argument. Anyway I'm always grateful for the help from this room so I'll stop ranting
[16:26:04] <Vorspire> yeah exactly, the problm with JS is the loose typing, IDE's can't predict members of objects because of it and that's where IDE's break down and docs come in
[16:40:29] <Gabriel__> I'm trying to pass (this) selector into a plugin's $(window).scroll() event.  The plugin is called like $(selector).myPlugin(arg1,arg2);  Before the scroll event in the plugin I tried: var floater = this; to access the selector via (floater) inside the scroll event, but it didn't work... Anyone?
[16:42:12] <Gabriel__> And the plugin works fine otherwise. I hacked the selector into the event by passing it as one of the plugins args, and it works fine.
[16:51:49] <Mainmam> what's the point of the "window." object? the guy in the videos I was watching put it before every variable in each function, but I took them all off without any noticeable change.
[16:52:41] <fourcolors> Mainmam: it's like a global object
[16:53:07] <fourcolors> use with caution
[16:54:51] <xp_prg> hi all, I want to make a temporary kind of info notification to my user about a change, I am wanting to do it in a cool way, any suggestions on the best way to do that?
[16:57:50] <landswipe> hey people… i have a very simple test… http://jsfiddle.net/landswipe/XN9N5/
[16:58:09] <landswipe> can anyone explain why div#test works for all the divs and #test only works for the first?
[16:58:22] <landswipe> i'm a n00b if you didn't guess
[16:58:49] <nFFF> landswipe
[16:58:55] <nFFF> id's should be unique homie
[16:59:50] <landswipe> can't I just say for all elements of id 'test' delay and fade out?
[17:00:29] <ravenzz> IDs are unique
[17:00:30] <nFFF> but you have two elements with the same id
[17:02:22] <landswipe> i can't reused the id?
[17:02:25] <landswipe> reuse i mean
[17:02:34] <zatan> $('.archive').append("<a href="+ key +"/" + item + "/"">" + item + "</a>");           I am getting  "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string"         I want to get "<a href="/key/value/">   the last slash "/"
[17:02:38] <ravenzz> you can in another page
[17:03:10] <ravenzz> zatan you should escape these quotes
[17:03:13] <nFFF> landswipe, one ID per element per page
[17:03:31] <ravenzz> use both the single quotes and the double ones
[17:04:06] <ravenzz> eg '<a href="foo">The foo</a>'
[17:04:42] <ravenzz> eg++ '<a href="foo'+bar+'">The foo</a>'
[17:06:01] <zatan> ravenzz, thanks :)
[17:08:29] <hi88is> Hi everyone. I have a challenging little item in front of me. I am trying to populate some Vars by manipulating the DOM with jQuery .html  -- please take a look over the code here: http://pastebin.com/yDg6E4Gp
[17:09:05] <hi88is> I am trying to replace the static values of the vars on line 15, 16, 17, and 18 with the values which will be loaded on the page on lines 45, 46, 47 and 48
[17:09:14] <hi88is> Can I do this with jQuery???
[17:09:32] <hi88is> I'm stumped and if I can get this issue figured out, I can finally go to bed! :P Please help.
[17:11:41] <ngharo> just echo the php vars right in your script on line 15, etc
[17:12:14] <ngharo> fromAd = "<?php echo $_GET['address']; ?>";
[17:12:44] <hi88is> Can you use php in declaring a var within javascript?
[17:12:59] <someprimetime> what would be faster in terms of loading images on a page: calling an exact copy of the page with different results in it through .get() and selecting only a container's contents() and returning the entire html and placing that on the page OR using .get() to return some json, parse it, and create the html on the page when it comes back
[17:13:12] <someprimetime> hi88is: why wouldn't you be able to?
[17:13:16] <hi88is> From line 1 to 26 - it is JS and I thought you couldn't use php in there
[17:13:22] <someprimetime> <?= var = blah; ?>
[17:13:41] <someprimetime> you most definitely can declare js variables from php
[17:13:47] <nFFF> dont forget to json_encode
[17:13:58] <hi88is> let me attempt the syntax based on your info
[17:14:14] <hi88is> I'll have to look into json_encode next
[17:14:27] <hi88is> I'm a bit over my head gang, thanks for the info and time.
[17:15:58] <iateadonut> how can you append some text to the end of an element's html?
[17:16:28] <hi88is> Isn't that a use of .html() ?
[17:16:49] <nFFF> .append()?
[17:16:50] <someprimetime> ? append() @ iateadonut
[17:16:55] <hi88is> haha - duh :P
[17:17:09] <iateadonut> thanks.
[17:17:14] <hi88is> thanks someprimetime and ngharo - it works. Phew
[17:17:25] <iateadonut> jquery is very tricky - use the function 'append' to append something
[17:17:39] <hi88is> nFFF - what will I have to do with json_encode?
[17:17:46] <hi88is> :P
[17:18:04] <nFFF> put your php variable in it
[17:18:26] <hi88is> can you reference me a URL which will show me an example. I've never used json_encode.
[17:20:23] <nFFF> ? json_encode
[17:20:27] <nFFF> google it
[17:20:30] <nFFF> first page
[17:20:34] <nFFF> first result
[17:20:42] <hi88is> cool cool - thought it might not be that easy :P
[18:08:16] <solidus-river> how do i break the chain of triggers on an element
[18:08:39] <solidus-river> i want to search for a certain condition when a user clicks a certain link and if that condition holds i need to stop any other handlers attached to the element from bieng called
[18:08:46] <jedimind_> just be all like "goddamn son, break that shit UP!"
[18:09:02] <jedimind_> its friday, dont mind me
[18:10:09] <solidus-river> lol
[18:10:26] <solidus-river> looks like stopImmediatePropigation() however these are all bieng handled by .on attached to window.document
[18:10:30] <solidus-river> so i don't know if that will cut it
[18:14:47] <prometh> help please:  www.mbrennen.com/help/test-case.html
[18:26:34] <brekfist_> what's the simplest way to have a function scroll/jump to another place on the page (like a named anchor)?
[18:27:10] <eddiemonge> brekfist: a named anchor
[18:27:41] <brekfist> but, say i put an anchor in there, what's the lightest-weight way of jumping to in in a fn?
[18:28:25] <prometh> eddiemonge: think i could get you to look at my code one more time?
[18:28:35] <prometh> one final thing to get working
[18:28:46] <prometh> i think it's the final thing, anyway
[18:29:13] <eddiemonge> prometh: you changed it so much and now it doesnt look appealling to me anymore
[18:29:23] <prometh> :/
[18:29:58] <prometh> what if i put a space background?
[18:30:05] <prometh> or some animated gifs
[18:31:24] <eddiemonge> prometh: its like you purposefully made it as difficult as possible
[18:31:35] <prometh> what did i do wrong?
[18:32:04] <prometh> i want things to animate independently
[18:32:18] <prometh> but when i add the external animation on the <li> it breaks
[18:32:35] <eddiemonge> like .animate({height:"hide", opacity:0}, "slow");
[18:32:48] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with slideUp()?
[18:32:51] <prometh> instead of hide() ?
[18:32:57] <prometh> slideUp() doesn't fadeOut()
[18:33:42] <eddiemonge> does it need to?
[18:33:46] <prometh> yes
[18:33:47] <scarlet_razor> i'm already searching for Tag features outhere but still cannot find any of integrating the use of autocomplete with on the user key typing....
[18:33:49] <prometh> looks better
[18:34:03] <eddiemonge> then what about .hide("slow")?
[18:34:10] <scarlet_razor> someone can give me a reference, i guess i miss it....
[18:34:17] <prometh> that resizes the width also
[18:34:25] <prometh> unless i specify a width in css, which i don't want to do
[18:34:37] <prometh> and besdies, what's the difference?
[18:35:18] <eddiemonge> three times as much code for not a lot of gain. visually, it really doesnt make a difference to the user
[18:35:32] <prometh> it does when all the other graphics are in place
[18:35:39] <brekfist> can i use this to simulate a click on a named anchor?     $('#named-anchor-element').trigger('click');
[18:35:51] <prometh> opaque items take visual priority.. easier to read
[18:36:04] <eddiemonge> brekfist: no
[18:38:23] <brekfist> erm.  why not? or rather, would that work if i first    $('#named-anchor-element').bind('click', 'function () { something here?? }
[18:38:37] <eddiemonge> yes
[18:38:41] <brekfist> in which case, what is the simplest 'something here'
[18:38:55] <prometh> eddiemonge: so, will you help me with the issue at hand instead of the design?
[18:38:59] <eddiemonge> brekfist: what the heck are you doing?
[18:39:29] <xp_prg> what is the css to control color after selection?
[18:39:41] <eddiemonge> ::selection
[18:39:51] <brekfist> i'm using anchors to make the page longer, and when i'm done it ends up at the anchor (top or middle of page). i want to tell it exactly where to scroll to when i'm done.
[18:40:02] <brekfist> which is probably somewhere at the bottom
[18:40:05] <prometh> i guess not... well, thanks for the help earlier, eddiemonge
[18:40:18] <mutedia> attr("style" ?
[18:40:23] <mutedia> oh
[18:40:24] <eddiemonge> brekfist: what do you mean by "using anchors to make the page longer"?
[18:41:01] <prometh> mutedia: would you be so kind as to look at my code for me please?
[18:41:44] <brekfist> um sec. a link would help.
[18:42:23] <mutedia> let me find the link, I'm a bit of a noob myself so i might not catch anything but the more basic mistakes
[18:42:46] <prometh> aye, well... ok... www.mbrennen.com/help/test-case.html
[18:42:53] <eddiemonge> prometh: a better place to put your test case would be at jsfiddle
[18:43:11] <prometh> ok
[18:44:07] <brekfist> eddiemonge: http://bit.ly/AtGpfa   --  after the page loads, i'd like the top of the blue to be at the top of the viewport
[18:44:35] <Logikos_> i got this line of code from a tutorial website but its throwing an error in console: var timer = $.timer(function() { mynamedfunction();  });
[18:44:44] <Logikos_> error says that $.timer is not a function
[18:45:07] <Logikos_> i got it from this site: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-timer/
[18:45:09] <eddiemonge> brekfist: add an id to the content and then for the url use that instead
[18:45:45] <Logikos_> oh... perhaps thats a plugin/addon ... and does not come with basic jquery?
[18:45:59] <prometh> http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[18:46:09] <brekfist> eddiemonge: i can't do that. the url gets parsed to tell what content to load.
[18:46:18] <eddiemonge> Logikos_: did you include the the timer code? doesnt sound like you did
[18:46:34] <eddiemonge> brekfist: from the hash?
[18:46:41] <brekfist> yeah
[18:47:04] <eddiemonge> ?scrollto @ brekfist
[18:47:06] <bot-t> brekfist, plugins.jquery.com - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[18:47:13] <mutedia> okay prometh what type of behavior do you want?
[18:47:31] <brekfist> yeah, i was hoping for something simpler? scrollTo is amazing, but totally overkill.
[18:47:49] <eddiemonge> ?mdn window.scroll @ brekfist
[18:47:51] <bot-t> brekfist, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[18:47:56] <eddiemonge> ?mdc scroll
[18:48:01] <bot-t> eddiemonge, window.scroll - MDN - Scrolls the window to a particular place in the document. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.scroll
[18:48:01] <xp_prg> I have <p> then <ol> and it causes a huge space in between them, how do I remove that space?
[18:48:15] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: by using valid markup?
[18:48:26] <brekfist> yeah those aren't supposed to nest
[18:49:08] <brekfist> it should still render though. you should use firebug to see what's creating the space
[18:49:22] <eddiemonge> the space is from the margin on the ol
[18:49:33] <eddiemonge> combined with the margin from the <p></p>
[18:49:45] <eddiemonge> <p><ol> == <p></p><ol>
[18:50:15] <brekfist> that doesn't sound 'huge'...
[18:50:31] <xp_prg> right, that is how it is
[18:50:34] <brekfist> everyone's always so hyperbolic
[18:50:38] <brekfist> :)
[18:50:52] <prometh> mutedia: i'd like for it to work how it does, only calculate the corrent height when a menu item is expanded
[18:56:31] <brekfist> why wouldn't this work $(window).scrollTop($('#container').position().top);
[18:56:45] <brekfist> at the end of the function that loads content
[18:58:48] <dogarrhea2> hrm
[18:58:58] <dogarrhea2> javascript console understands my custom made javascript
[18:59:08] <eddiemonge> prometh: i dont think you want to collapse items. i think you want contents in collapseListItems
[18:59:08] <dogarrhea2> but when i .parseJSON, i get an error
[18:59:26] <prometh> eddiemonge: i want to collapse both
[18:59:45] <eddiemonge> brekfist: it might. did you try it?
[18:59:54] <eddiemonge> prometh: then you collapse the all the li's
[19:00:14] <prometh> it collapses all, but then expandListItem() expands one of them
[19:02:42] <brekfist> eddiemonge: yeah, i have it on that same page now. it doesn't seem to do anything.
[19:04:42] <eddiemonge> brekfist: do you have a #container element?
[19:05:13] <brekfist> there's so many different ways of having jq move you around the page, i figured someone here would be able to suggest one that was the most elemental, and then i could work on getting it work.
[19:05:24] <brekfist> eddiemonge: i should….. checking ....
[19:05:40] <dogarrhea2> oh figured it out
[19:05:42] <dogarrhea2> need a string
[19:06:22] <brekfist> eddiemonge: i thought maybe i fat fingerred it, but yeah it's there
[19:07:06] <eddiemonge> brekfist: jquery doesnt move you around the page. it selects elements on the page
[19:07:23] <eddiemonge> window.scroll(0, $('#container').position().top);
[19:08:26] <dogarrhea2> why is jquery erroring on this? $.parseJSON("{'description':'none','hash':'d684cc157dac4c86957e03439d009b1e6854495d','answers':['none']}")
[19:09:16] <dogarrhea2> parseJSON bug?
[19:09:25] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: jsonlint.com
[19:10:17] <brekfist> eddiemonge: don't think so. doesn't work.
[19:10:32] <dogarrhea2> seems like the javascript console thinks that object is just fine
[19:11:11] <dogarrhea2> var blah = {'description':'none','hash':'d684cc157dac4c86957e03439d009b1e6854495d','answers':['none']} ----> undefined.   blah object
[19:11:32] <pifantastic> dogarrhea2: that is invalid
[19:11:35] <pifantastic> need double quotes
[19:11:44] <mutedia> prometh, I don't know much about animating but if you want t otrigger things I think eddie talked about using the callback to hide()
[19:11:44] <dogarrhea2> ok
[19:11:49] <dogarrhea2> so that's the problem..
[19:12:01] <mutedia> http://api.jquery.com/hide/#speedcallback
[19:12:08] <eddiemonge> brekfist: works for me. type it in your console
[19:12:27] <shesek> dogarrhea2, object literals in JavaScript and JSON aren't exactly the same
[19:12:40] <shesek> dogarrhea2, JSON has a stricter syntax
[19:13:13] <dogarrhea2> so it must use double quotes everywehre?
[19:13:20] <dogarrhea2> bleh. whoever's reading my code is going to vomit
[19:13:50] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: yes. you should read about what JSON actually is/formatted
[19:14:52] <dogarrhea2> ok. the single quotes was the problem
[19:14:58] <brekfist> eddiemonge: that's cool. i didn't know i could do that. it returns undef, but i suppose that's okay. for some reason it doesn't work from the script though
[19:15:06] <dogarrhea2> strange. for all this time i thought you could interchange single quot and double quote
[19:15:14] <dogarrhea2> but now i found a case where it breaks
[19:15:14] <brekfist> http://bit.ly/AtGpfa
[19:15:42] <eddiemonge> brekfist: maybe because your markup sucks
[19:15:46] <chovy> is it possible to check for an element existing at a given position? ie: 400px from top of parent, check if there is a <div> there.
[19:15:51] <eddiemonge> validate that and clean it up
[19:15:56] <eddiemonge> scripts at the bottom of the page
[19:16:34] <brekfist> yeah. i've been messing around with it for too long. you put scripts inline, but at the bottom?
[19:16:52] <brekfist> btw, that table cfm crap aint mine, i'm not supposed to touch it, either.
[19:17:09] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: JSON is javascript. its a subset of it
[19:17:43] <eddiemonge> chovy: for what?
[19:18:05] <prometh> mutedia: a callback would delay teh animation, though
[19:18:06] <eddiemonge> brekfist: i dont put scripts inline
[19:18:38] <chovy> eddiemonge: if it exists.
[19:18:46] <brekfist> you put two links right before </body> ? one for jq and one for your custom stuff?
[19:19:18] <chovy> eddiemonge: I have a div, with a bunch of elements inside it that are absolutely positioned. I need to figure out if there is a div at 400px from top and 0 from left.
[19:19:36] <chovy> all i have are x & y coordinates.
[19:19:51] <eddiemonge> where are you getting those from?
[19:19:55] <eddiemonge> ?xy
[19:19:55] <bot-t> You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[19:19:58] <chovy> they are passed to me.
[19:19:59] <Bustin> any idea why loading an external .html via jquery would make the next function not work? here is my code... thanks - http://pastebin.com/dXCsM0mW
[19:20:10] <eddiemonge> brekfist: yes
[19:20:53] <eddiemonge> Bustin: pastebin sucks and that has nothing of the question you asked
[19:21:03] <eddiemonge> chovy: how?
[19:21:46] <chovy> eddiemonge: i have the y coordinate only, and the height of it. I can place it from top: y; but I need to know if there is already an element positioned there.
[19:21:58] <eddiemonge> prometh: describe the exact behavior you want to happen because i am not going to be remaking this a third time
[19:22:13] <eddiemonge> chovy: how do you have the y coordinate?
[19:22:14] <prometh> no need to remake it... this is how i want it... except for the bug
[19:22:30] <chovy> y = 100 for example
[19:22:43] <prometh> just read the descriptions at the link.. it's all there
[19:22:45] <chovy> it's just passed into my function as a number.
[19:22:45] <prometh> http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[19:24:02] <eddiemonge> prometh: not really. i want you to describe the interaction for me
[19:24:04] <Bustin> eddiemonge: Ok, I'll try to rephrase. I am including an external html file, which is a navigation menu. Now when I remove the code to include that navigation menu, the slideup / slidedown transitions work, but when I have it included, the functions don't work. Here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/hYMVR/
[19:24:14] <eddiemonge> chovy: whats passing it in?
[19:24:21] <prometh> click item, it expands, others collapse/hide
[19:24:39] <prometh> click button, item 1 hides, item 2 expands
[19:24:51] <eddiemonge> Bustin: is the #nav li in that menu.html?
[19:24:56] <prometh> except for the initial list view, only 1 item should be seen at a time
[19:25:02] <Bustin> eddiemonge: yes
[19:26:00] <eddiemonge> Bustin: you need to either: a) put the hover code in an .on() delegation or b) put the hover code in the load success callback. its being called immediately after the .load() is but before the content is added
[19:27:35] <jowop> hello! on line 30 i am calling validationEngine on a form that has been loaded in via ajax. even though the validationEngine is called, the fields are not validated. http://pastebin.com/a6BF9xSU
[19:28:50] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ jowop
[19:28:50] <bot-t> jowop, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[19:28:52] <Bustin> eddiemonge: thank you, sorted it. Appreciate your assistance.
[19:29:33] <prometh> click item 1, it expands, others collapse/hide .... click button in expanded item 1 and the whole item hides, and item 2 expands
[19:29:40] <prometh> eddiemonge: click item 1, it expands, others collapse/hide .... click button in expanded item 1 and the whole item hides, and item 2 expands
[19:30:36] <someprimetime> from a user experience side of things, is it best to fix position a modal window on the page or have it statically positioned? because i'm about to write a modal plugin and deciding about handling different screen resolutions (e.g. if the content in a fixed modal extends the viewable window)
[19:30:44] <someprimetime> i guess i could just pass it an option
[19:30:55] <eddiemonge> prometh: and if button in item 3 is clicked?
[19:31:04] <prometh> same thing
[19:31:25] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: any reason you are writing your own instead of using one of the thousands available?
[19:31:32] <prometh> err wait, no not in 3
[19:31:33] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: learning experience
[19:31:37] <prometh> button in 3... goes back to list view
[19:31:58] <someprimetime> plus i am kind of OCD about using my own code vs. others
[19:31:58] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: theres better learning experiences, trust me. a modal can get insanely complex
[19:32:09] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: any you'd recommend me to use?
[19:32:11] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: then why are you using jquery?
[19:32:19] <eddiemonge> jqueryui dialog
[19:33:00] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: i use jquery because it makes some things easier (cross browser compatibility shit)
[19:33:09] <someprimetime> but i'm trying to do a lot more stuff in pure js to learn when i can
[19:40:51] <brekfist> anyone know why i'd get a No Doctype warning from w3 validator, even though I have a doctype?
[19:41:31] <Guest87624> How can I send POST params when the query variable ends with []? like this: http://pastebin.com/Ve7W3tep - it errors on "[" in the line that reads cathegory_ids[]: ''
[19:41:59] <brekfist> nm, typos are the answer....
[19:42:13] <dogarrhea2> ok
[19:42:16] <dogarrhea2> jsonlint passes the test
[19:42:22] <dogarrhea2> but parseJSON still fails
[19:42:53] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: paste code again
[19:43:10] <eddiemonge> Guest87624: you cant do that
[19:43:22] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/29048
[19:43:36] <eddiemonge> Guest87624: thats not a valid key for an object
[19:43:37] <dogarrhea2> do i need to put it in quotes?
[19:43:56] <prometh> eddiemonge: ?
[19:44:09] <eddiemonge> its like you all find new code pasting sites to eff me up and make me not want to help you
[19:44:22] <prometh> ?
[19:44:33] <Guest87624> eddiemonge: oh, but that's what the site's documentation says needs to be passed as argument.. I think it's to do with a php array
[19:44:34] <prometh> i've been waiting 15min
[19:44:35] <eddiemonge> prometh: wait your turn. you gave me overly complex code and your priority drops
[19:44:35] <prometh> same link
[19:44:56] <prometh> but i'm awesome
[19:45:48] <Gabriel__> I'm trying to pass (this) selector into a plugin's $(window).scroll() event.  The plugin is called like $(selector).myPlugin(arg1,arg2);  Before the scroll event in the plugin I tried: var floater = this; to access the selector via (floater) inside the scroll event, but it didn't work... Anyone?
[19:46:22] <Guest87624> is there no way to send x[] through as queryparam through jquery at all then?
[19:51:21] <eddiemonge> Guest87624: what site?
[19:55:41] <eddiemonge> prometh: you want the h2 and p to hide when the div is expanded right?
[19:55:54] <prometh> just the p
[19:56:20] <dogarrhea2> bah quotes or not quotes
[19:56:24] <dogarrhea2> it validates on jsonlint
[19:56:32] <dogarrhea2> but not in parseJSON
[19:57:16] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: how are you getting that string?
[19:57:24] <dogarrhea2> from a httpresponse
[19:57:27] <dogarrhea2> ajax
[19:57:54] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: a jquery ajax call?
[19:58:02] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/29050
[19:59:03] <eddiemonge> whats above that?
[20:00:44] <brekfist> http://bit.ly/wOvlhW     -- cleaned up as much as i can. i would hope to see the cat when page loads, but no such luck
[20:00:53] <dogarrhea2> just the regular ajax stuff
[20:01:12] <dogarrhea2> it will return the exact string that validates in json lint from the httresponse
[20:01:23] <dogarrhea2> do i need to return a string that has \" in it rather?
[20:01:26] <eddiemonge> prometh: grr. i was almost done then accidently refreshed the page. hold on
[20:01:37] <prometh> ><
[20:01:39] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: paste the whole ajax call
[20:02:49] <xp_prg> do you guys know about that kind of div that you put up when you want to show information then you have like a little close thing that hides it?
[20:03:00] <dogarrhea2>  		$.ajax({ 		type: 'POST', 		url: "/getStuff", 		data: { 		},
[20:03:10] <dogarrhea2> that was above the success function
[20:03:15] <someprimetime> doharrhea
[20:03:15] <someprimetime> LOL
[20:03:18] <someprimetime> what a hilarious username
[20:03:25] <someprimetime> dog*
[20:03:35] <dogarrhea2> this is what i have been calling my sister as of 8 years ago
[20:03:44] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: dataType: "json" to that to solve all of your lifes problems
[20:03:48] <someprimetime> óò
[20:03:57] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: modal or a dialog
[20:04:05] <xp_prg> its just a div
[20:04:15] <eddiemonge> brekfist: jquery 1.4.2?
[20:04:33] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: its called a modal or a dialog
[20:04:42] <xp_prg> no, this is a div on a web page, aghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
[20:04:49] <brekfist> eddiemonge: works fine. doesn't matter. i was using 171 too. want me to change it?
[20:05:12] <eddiemonge> brekfist: yes please. and then replace that last line with:
[20:05:40] <eddiemonge> setTimeout( function() { window.scroll(0, $('#container').position().top); },1 );
[20:06:30] <brekfist> weird. that crossed my mind earlier, you think that's what's going on? i never understand js timing very well
[20:06:32] <Gabriel__> How do I call a plugin function on a selector, and have that plugin pass the selector into a $(window).scroll() event? Passing the (this) object info a variable before the scroll event isn't even working
[20:07:11] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge changed it to jsonp
[20:07:33] <dogarrhea2> well it's not working
[20:07:36] <dogarrhea2> either jsonp or json
[20:08:01] <Gabriel__> oops, it is.... still had one (this) still being called in the scroll function.... is this the best way to get (this) into the event, via a variable?
[20:08:45] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: jsonp is very different from json. when you have dataType: "json" do console.log(data) without calling anything else
[20:08:46] <Gabriel__> seems sloppy
[20:09:20] <eddiemonge> Gabriel__: i have no idea what you just said
[20:09:47] <eddiemonge> prometh: for now, i am going to use .show("slow") and .hide("slow") and you can add in your crazy animations after
[20:09:53] <prometh> ok
[20:11:19] <dogarrhea2> eddiemonge i get a 200 and an "unexpected token" error now
[20:11:59] <dogarrhea2> same data that validates in jsonlint
[20:12:08] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: you have to have your failed event pass back a json string now
[20:12:22] <brekfist> eddiemonge: thanks. does the trick. it doesn't position it where i thought, of course :) , but it works with the timeout and can be tinkered
[20:12:23] <dogarrhea2> surrounded by single quote?
[20:13:00] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: no. json is always double quotes. are you using php?
[20:13:09] <dogarrhea2> python django
[20:13:15] <eddiemonge> brekfist: do you know why it works?
[20:13:19] <prometh> dogarrhea2: go away :)
[20:13:50] <Gabriel__> (selector).myPlugin(arg1,arg2) --> jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function(arg1,arg2) { var selector = this; $(window).scroll(function() { alert(selector) });   <--- is that the best way to get my selector in there? seems sloppy
[20:14:05] <brekfist> sort of. i gather that it was firing before the content had loaded before. not in a ready state
[20:14:16] <prometh> brekfist: go away :)
[20:14:22] <brekfist> like i said. i'm weak on that. but it totally crossed my mind.
[20:14:23] <dogarrhea2> ARGh
[20:14:29] <dogarrhea2> now i'm getting "unexpected token d" error
[20:14:41] <brekfist> prometh: i'm hungry anyway :)
[20:14:58] <brekfist> this place is great though.
[20:15:02] <brekfist> good evening for now!
[20:15:12] <prometh> cheers
[20:15:25] <eddiemonge> brekfist: no. the browser was doing its thing, scrolling to #home. by adding the setTimeout, you let it do its thing then you did your thang
[20:15:36] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: where? you arent being helpful in your troubleshooting
[20:15:42] <dogarrhea2> http://www.pasteall.org/29051
[20:15:44] <prometh> eddiemonge: how goes it?
[20:15:49] <dogarrhea2> so this is now what's getting sent back
[20:15:57] <brekfist> eddiemonge: isn't that what i just said?
[20:15:57] <dogarrhea2> before it didn't have the opening and closing quotes
[20:16:04] <brekfist> ima pass out if i don't eat now.
[20:16:13] <brekfist> eddiemonge: THX MUCH
[20:16:15] <brekfist> late
[20:16:35] <prometh> eddiemonge:  i honestly don't require you to write anything for me.. just need to know why my animate() fails
[20:16:47] <Gabriel__> Did anyone catch that?
[20:17:50] <dogarrhea2> so i'm pasting the httpresponse right into jsonlint.. and it's validating. and jquery is saying unexpected token
[20:17:58] <dogarrhea2> i don't even know what to look for now
[20:22:35] <dogarrhea2> so. where do i begin to diagnose this problem
[20:23:02] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ Gabriel__
[20:23:03] <bot-t> Gabriel__, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:23:22] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: you can start by pasting some code for us to see ? demo
[20:23:23] <bot-t> dogarrhea2, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:23:54] <dogarrhea2> o well i guess no one can diagnose. gah this is going to take more time than its worth i'll just step away for now
[20:24:35] <dogarrhea2> i mean.. when the page response is exactly the string that validates in jsonlint
[20:24:42] <dogarrhea2> i don't get why people are skeptical
[20:24:53] <dogarrhea2> like i view source. and that is exactly the string that i copy into jsonlint
[20:29:18] <Mainmam> why's IE gotta hate on CS3?
[20:31:24] <prometh> eddiemonge: dude... what's goin on?
[20:31:38] <prometh> should i wait or.. ?
[20:41:06] <eddiemonge> prometh: i give up. whats that original code again?
[20:41:11] <prometh> fuck
[20:41:20] <prometh> http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[20:51:17] <eddiemonge> ?eval 0
[20:51:21] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 0
[20:51:37] <eddiemonge> ?eval if ( 0 ) {true;}else{false;}
[20:51:40] <bot-t> eddiemonge: false
[20:52:39] <prometh> eddiemonge: are you still stringing me along?
[20:52:57] <mutedia> take him out to dinner first
[20:53:39] <prometh> mcdonalds? :)
[20:53:39] <mutedia> I know about .stop and how it stops animations queuing, but isn'T that a hack that hide() and show() were designed to fix?
[20:53:50] <mutedia> I mean, i'm just repeating what eddie said
[20:54:04] <prometh> i can't use hide/show, though
[20:54:10] <prometh> my animations are more custom
[20:54:25] <prometh> and stop() is just in case animations overlap
[20:54:35] <prometh> some users click very fast
[20:54:37] <mutedia> and what's the end-user experience?
[20:54:45] <mutedia> yeah, it's animation queuing, I guess
[20:56:10] <eddiemonge> ?when
[20:56:11] <bot-t> jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[20:56:38] <Logikos_> i'm mostly new to javascript/jquery but i'm trying ot make something and i think i'm going about my jquery element references the hard way: http://jsfiddle.net/bzCBb/3/
[20:57:04] <Mainmam> do the Lynda.com tutorial videos on javascript written in 2009
[20:57:04] <Logikos_> in there inside $('.scrollbox').each() .. i'm building a reference with var ref = "#" + $(this)....
[20:57:11] <eddiemonge> prometh: theres your problem. you need to have expandListItems wait until collapseItems is done
[20:57:13] <Mainmam> they are much better than any online guide
[20:57:29] <Logikos_> so that my function can work with that reference ...
[20:57:32] <prometh> eddiemonge: why? i have stop()'s in place for overlaps
[20:57:41] <eddiemonge> its not the stops
[20:57:44] <Logikos_> is there a way to pass the reference useing the 'this' keyword somehow ?
[20:57:48] <eddiemonge> its the animations after the stops
[20:57:55] <prometh> i've done these animations all at once before... when i had everything set up as "toggle"
[20:58:22] <prometh> but "toggle" is restrictive
[21:00:05] <prometh> so, i know it's possible.. i just dont' know why it's currently not working
[21:01:42] <mutedia> I'm still trying to understand your code, learning myself
[21:03:21] <prometh> cool
[21:04:59] <Logikos_> say i have $(".slider").mouseenter(function(){ } ... and inside that function i want to do a reference like $(".scrollbox") .. but i only want to reference .scrollbox objects within the .slider my mouse enteres ... how do i do that?
[21:05:32] <eddiemonge> ?queue
[21:05:33] <bot-t1> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[21:06:24] <Logikos_> that wasnt for me was it?
[21:12:35] <mutedia> well I've been messing around
[21:13:24] <mutedia> when you expand
[21:13:29] <mutedia> you use eq(i)
[21:13:41] <mutedia> but when you collapse, it sends the animation to every li
[21:14:12] <eddiemonge> prometh: i dont know if this helps at all: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/NgQ7S/35/
[21:14:48] <prometh> check out the choppy animation when going to step 2 and 3... i ran into this exact problem as well
[21:14:53] <mutedia> yeah
[21:15:01] <prometh> this is where i think there is a jquery bug
[21:15:23] <mutedia> well, it doesn't change that you can do what you want
[21:15:37] <mutedia>   items.not(i > -1 ? items.eq(i) :
[21:15:39] <mutedia> that's the line you want
[21:16:17] <mutedia> the way I understand it is you'Re sending animate() to every list item and their children
[21:16:25] <mutedia> unless it's first come first served
[21:19:23] <prometh> i never would've thought to put eq() inside not()
[21:19:25] <prometh> much better than strings
[21:23:36] <Mainmam> but sometimes there's a rumble in the low end that EQ does away with nicely
[21:23:54] <prometh> playing guitar?
[21:24:09] <Mainmam> oh, thought I was in #audioworld
[21:24:13] <Mainmam> saw EQ n strings
[21:25:13] <prometh> eq isn't always the best way to get rid of rumble
[21:25:13] <prometh> :P
[21:26:09] <Mainmam> depends if you can do another take
[21:28:33] <prometh> yeah.. EQ stuff should be slight mods only
[21:28:43] <prometh> anything extreme and it's just gonna sound thin
[21:41:04] <Hoi> Hey
[21:41:21] <Hoi> i'm looking for someone who is a pro at jquery.
[21:41:38] <prometh> not me
[21:41:40] <prometh> brb
[21:42:45] <Hoi> :/
[21:43:03] <Mainmam> me either bro
[21:43:17] <Hoi> Is that sarcasm?
[21:44:29] <Hoi> I need help with a image slider plugin I found for wordpress, but the problem is it doesn't have a thumbnail navigation system.
[21:44:50] <Hoi> called wp-cycle which is a jquery-cycle
[21:45:04] <prometh> ok guys... here's my updated test case... i still think i'm running into a jquery bug:   http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[21:46:02] <Hoi> I'm having trouble on how I need to implement a  thumbnail navigation for my image slider.
[21:54:41] <Mainmam> i just started this shiz a week ago
[22:28:53] <oojacoboo> if($("#recurring").is(":checked") && ($("#recur-dom").val() >= 1 <= 28))
[22:28:58] <oojacoboo> I can't do this?
[22:29:40] <oojacoboo> maybe I should use .between
[22:30:29] <oojacoboo> actually, that's proto :P
[22:56:30] <prometh> oojacoboo: put $("#recur-dom").val() in a var
[22:56:57] <prometh> and do val>=1 && val <=2
[23:09:44] <intellilogic> So Foo IS "[5,5]" I want to convert it to Foo IS [5,5], how can I do this?
[23:20:45] <Qalqi> Is it possible to midfy jquery UI dateppicker?
[23:39:00] <DerekHastur> Hi guys. I have a problem. I have textarea and binded keyDown event. For certain cases, I want to preventDefault() and throw alert dialog... event.preventDefault() works fine, but when I add window.alert it stops working :( example here: http://jsfiddle.net/ykYqQ/
[23:39:01] <theBrettman> can I use $.post on a div with inputs in it?
[23:39:10] <theBrettman> like instead of using a form
[23:40:23] <DerekHastur> Same behaviour on latest Chrome and Firefox
[23:40:41] <DerekHastur> Can someone explain and help me find workaround?
[23:40:54] <theBrettman> like $.post("test.php", $('#mydiv').serialize()); ?
[23:42:50] <theBrettman> DerekHastur, put window.alert before event.preventDefault
[23:42:57] <theBrettman> then it works
[23:43:38] <theBrettman> and it for some reason tells the key pressed
[23:44:29] <theBrettman> never knew it did that. woulda came in handy before, lol
[23:44:58] <theBrettman> Qalqi, of course you can modify the datepicker
[23:45:30] <theBrettman> who is good with $.ajax?
[23:45:33] <DerekHastur> I am pretty sure I already tried that with no result.
[23:45:45] <theBrettman> I did it and it worked
[23:46:00] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/ykYqQ/2/
[23:46:36] <ngharo> DerekHastur: bind to keypress
[23:47:09] <DerekHastur> theBrettman: nope, still writing
[23:47:12] <Qalqi> theBrettman, I want the function of clicking on the date in the calender is to redirect to a url defined by me
[23:47:21] <DerekHastur> ngharo: I'll try that
[23:47:33] <Qalqi> at present it just fills an input box with a date
[23:47:34] <theBrettman> still writing?
[23:47:41] <theBrettman> oh, it's not supposed to write?
[23:47:41] <Qalqi> i want to change it
[23:47:49] <theBrettman> he didn't specify that
[23:48:10] <theBrettman> Qalqi, then use the callback
[23:48:58] <Qalqi> please elaborate a bit
[23:49:31] <Qalqi> how to use callback
[23:49:32] <Qalqi> ?
[23:49:53] <theBrettman> google callback?
[23:50:22] <theBrettman> and then read the docs for the datepicker and find the callback for clicking on the date
[23:50:38] <ngharo> Qalqi: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#event-onSelect
[23:50:48] <theBrettman> or selecting a date, whatever
[23:51:14] <theBrettman> it's going to be pretty complicated for what you're trying to do cuz you will have to have dates assigned
[23:51:21] <DerekHastur> theBrettman: yeah, what did you think I am trying to achieve with preventDefault od keypress :) switching alert and prevent had no effect on anything
[23:51:25] <theBrettman> but good luck in your challenge, that's what makes it all fun! :)
[23:51:47] <DerekHastur> ngharo: thanks, keypress actually works... I wonder why's that
[23:52:37] <ngharo> yeah that's an unusual result you had
[23:52:55] <theBrettman> which order did it work in? the order I put it in or the order u put it in?
[23:53:12] <theBrettman> I got it to work with keypress too but I have it in the order I put it in
[23:53:14] <ngharo> i know for every key, you get keydown, keypress, keyup events and more depending on browser
[23:53:17] <theBrettman> not sure it matters...
[23:53:45] <theBrettman> so ngharo, any good with $.ajax?
[23:54:09] <ngharo> maybe
[23:55:38] <theBrettman> I have a div and it has inputs (it's a dialog) and I want to collect that data and post it. can that be done like  $.post("test.php", $('#mydiv').serialize()); this?
[23:57:19] <theBrettman> should I repost the question cuz the room is bein funny?
[23:58:23] <ngharo> why wouldn't you just wrap it in a form to be compliant?
[23:58:45] <theBrettman> eh, ok
[23:59:17] <DerekHastur> theBrettman: order doesn't matter... with keydown preventDefault works only until you add alert... with keypress it works even with alert...
[23:59:45] <DerekHastur> thanks again, I'm off
