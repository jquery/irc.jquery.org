[00:20:20] <Zogot> Ahoy
[00:20:48] <topriddy> forgive me please, but i am having problem groking the difference between filter and find. they seem to meet the same purpose
[00:26:30] <twolfson> filter works on the current collection
[00:26:41] <twolfson> find looks at the descendants

[00:28:05] <Cork> idiot...
[00:29:44] <JKarsrud> indeed
[00:32:11] <zakwilson> Is my understanding correct that the jquery UI datepicker doesn't support disabling multiple date ranges?
[00:34:13] <DanGer> ah, why did they shut down the plugins site without first bringing the new one? I don't get it... :/
[00:35:27] <Cork> DanGer: might have been forced to by spam abuse or something like that
[00:35:44] <Cork> (only guessing though)
[00:36:01] <ajpiano> DanGer: Cork is correct
[00:36:21] <ajpiano> we'll be putting out more info in the next couple days
[00:37:31] <DanGer> Cork, ajpiano, ok I understand the matter, but why not just turn of the submissions or whatever part of the web the spam came from?
[00:38:13] <ajpiano> DanGer: that site was a complete ghetto
[00:38:38] <JKarsrud> I didn't even know anyone used it anymore..?
[00:38:44] <ajpiano> i think the vast majority of users left it behind some time ago
[00:39:26] <ajpiano> so this sitch kinda forces us to get some real steam behind actually getting a new useful site up and running
[00:39:41] <coldhead> does it just
[00:40:13] <JKarsrud> ajpiano: indeed
[00:40:29] <coldhead> deja vu
[00:43:32] <JKarsrud> is it just me, or does the "Vibrator API" sound a bit dirty?
[00:44:10] <JKarsrud> http://people.mozilla.org/~jhammink/webapi_test_pages/VibratorAPIdemo.html
[00:44:37] <DanGer> does anyone have an idea how can I apply slimScroll (http://rocha.la/jQuery-slimScroll) onto all scrollers on the page?
[00:45:53] <JKarsrud> DanGer: you could just give them all a class?
[00:50:04] <Jeroenem> im stuck with a piece of jquery.. i want to get the document.location.href and add it to a specific link on my page -> http://pastebin.com/NXGsAcYf but it adds undifined in my dom. URLS are like: <a href="undifinedhttp://www.facebook.com/?share=u">
[00:57:50] <topriddy> forgive me please, but i am having problem groking the difference between filter and find. they seem to meet the same purpose
[00:58:40] <ajpiano> filter filters the current collection
[00:58:50] <ravenzz> did you read the short definition?
[00:59:00] <ajpiano> find searches the descendants of current collection
[00:59:15] <megatrond> Jeroenem: window.location?
[00:59:44] <megatrond> Jeroenem: sry, window.location.href
[01:00:56] <cloaked1> struggling to find out how to use selector to get named option from select box. $('#tag[name=value]') is not working.  that is the correct way to do it, right?
[01:01:18] <xec> cloaked1: the # is for id's
[01:01:31] <xec> cloaked1: omit it for tag names
[01:01:38] <zabka> hi. window.location.pathname shows site.asp, but  $.ajax( {  URL: window.location.pathname, .. calls site.asp?param1=val1
[01:01:57] <xec> cloaked1: and you might need to quote the value
[01:01:59] <zabka> i have also tried with substring
[01:02:05] <cloaked1> xec: apologies. It is using an id.
[01:02:07] <ravenzz> ajpiano can I pm you 1 sec?
[01:02:14] <ajpiano> i guess
[01:02:32] <cloaked1> xec: let me try the quote. The name is a number so that might be the problem.
[01:03:08] <zabka> how can i say to ajax  URL: window.location.pathname,  wothout parameters?
[01:03:17] <Jeroenem> megatrond; thanks, will give it a try!
[01:04:14] <Jeroenem> megatrond: keeps adding undified infront of my URL's
[01:04:31] <cloaked1> xec: hm. quotes no worky. Totally stumping me.
[01:04:49] <xec> zabka: maybe window.location.pathname.split("?")[0]
[01:05:15] <megatrond> Jeroenem: this: jQuery('.facebook').attr() is undefined
[01:05:24] <xec> zabka: dunno if there might be some drawbacks to that
[01:05:39] <JKarsrud> cloaked1: if the element has an id, it's unique, so why do you need to check for an attribute on it too?
[01:05:54] <zabka> xec but why it shows without argument in alert? is it 'normal'?
[01:06:44] <megatrond> cloaked1: i'm using it like this: $('#id select[name="NAME"]').val()
[01:06:55] <xec> zabka: i thought window.location.pathname *was* without parameters
[01:06:57] <zabka> xec: may be if you have more ? in a query
[01:07:06] <cloaked1> megatrond: Oh! Let me try that.
[01:07:15] <zabka> xec, no forget
[01:07:28] <zabka> (according to drawback)
[01:07:37] <cloaked1> JKarsrud: I'm not looking for the attribute. I'm trying to set an option as seleted.
[01:07:45] <xec> zabka: when I test it, i dont get any parameters
[01:07:48] <cloaked1> but can't do that until I can select it. :)
[01:08:01] <xec> zabka: just path (without the split hack)
[01:08:11] <zabka> yes, but the question is why  URL: window.location.pathname calls in ajax with params
[01:08:34] <zabka> xec: hi. window.location.pathname shows site.asp, but  $.ajax( {  URL: window.location.pathname, .. calls site.asp?param1=val1
[01:08:53] <megatrond> zabka: have you tried using $.get()?
[01:09:04] <JKarsrud> cloaked1: whut?
[01:09:23] <JKarsrud> ah, right
[01:09:34] <xec> cloaked1: http://jsfiddle.net/2C7p6/ <-- works on *my* machine
[01:09:34] <zabka> megatrond: i need post
[01:09:46] <cloaked1> megatrond: Yeah. Didn't work. I don't get it. xec: checking.
[01:09:49] <Jeroenem> megatrond: this is the complete code... not sure why facebook is giving back undifined :/ http://jsfiddle.net/LTZEK/
[01:10:59] <megatrond> Jeroenem: that seem to be working as expected, it adds the current page location to the links href attribute
[01:11:27] <Jeroenem> yeah, i see.. strange thing is when loading this into jquery mobile - it keeps giving back undifined
[01:11:58] <xec> zabka: are you using GET or POST?
[01:12:42] <zabka> xec: post
[01:13:38] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/7JVhzmbT. it calls mode=edit(which is in url). i wanna mode=update(which is in line 6)
[01:13:46] <zabka> xec ^^
[01:14:03] <xec> zabka: try lowercase "url" rather than "URL"
[01:14:36] <zabka> h, stupid me, let me try
[01:14:46] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, i have a div to which i bound click event.. it has internal divs.. i dont know why whenever i click, the bound handler is being executed twice.. any idea?
[01:16:04] <xec> dinosaadeh: what does your selector look like?
[01:17:39] <GreekFreak> Hi. I'm running jQuery on Rails 3.1 and I'm trying to implement a datepicker. I'm trying to populate the date_select field (3 date drop down boxes) as opposed to a text_field. Any advice?
[01:18:23] <dinosaadeh> xec: $('#gridListingEntries div[id^=row]').click(function () { $(this).toggleClass('selected'); })
[01:18:23] <zabka> xec: yes, thnak you very much, solved
[01:20:11] <xec> dinosaadeh: is it possible the "[id^=row]" matches two nested divs, by chance? or that this code is ran or included twice?
[01:20:18] <cloaked1> xec: Using your same link, the following does not work (I'm probably doing it wrong) but this is analogous to what I'm trying to accomplish on my end: $("#select-choice[name='Choice 3']").attr('selected',true);
[01:20:32] <dinosaadeh> xec: lemme try
[01:20:34] <cloaked1> that line also fails on jsfiddle
[01:23:22] <xec> cloaked1: there is nothing with the name "Choice 3"
[01:23:46] <xec> cloaked1: but there is an option with that *value* -- which is a child of that ID
[01:24:19] <xec> cloaked1: so... maybe something like "#select-choice [value='Choice 3']"
[01:26:02] <cloaked1> xec: hmm. k. Let me check that.
[01:32:22] <cloaked1> hmm
[01:33:26] <cloaked1> xec: two things. 1- I was mislabeling my options with "name=" vs "value=". Still didn't work. What *does* work, though, is: $('#selector>option[value="val"]');
[01:33:42] <cloaked1> didn't figure that I needed to be more specific with my selector
[01:33:55] <cloaked1> I appreciate your guys' help!
[01:33:58] <xec> cloaked1: you don't - 10 buck says you forgot a space ;)
[01:34:17] <xec> bucks*
[01:35:04] <cloaked1> So you're sayin that $('#selector [name='val']"); should work?
[01:35:08] <cloaked1> I'll try it.
[01:35:14] <xec> not name
[01:35:41] <cloaked1> grr
[01:35:43] <cloaked1> right
[01:35:47] <cloaked1> sorry... long day
[01:35:50] <xec> :D
[01:35:52] <Xotix> hi
[01:36:14] <cloaked1> xec: you're right! *sigh*
[01:36:36] <GreekFreak> How do I populate 3 dropdown boxes with a date using a datepicker (instead of populateing a textfield)
[01:36:38] <xec> cloaked1: maybe you need a break ;)
[01:36:51] <cloaked1> hahahaha...maybe. ;)
[01:36:59] <cloaked1> at any rate, I appreciate your help!
[01:37:06] <xec> yw
[01:40:08] <nisseni> anyone has any experience with "not normal chars" with jquery - http://pastie.org/private/4oxlsw7cba7q4nywspes6w - all array objects work but "Byggår" and I think it's because it as "å" in it, the function should remove the array value from a field
[01:40:55] <Cork> nisseni: what encoding do you have on your files?
[01:41:59] <Cork> nisseni: as long as your using utf-8 there shouldn't be a problem
[01:42:02] <xec> GreekFreak: afaik the jquery ui datepicker only supports a single textfield unfortunately. you would have to customize or find another plugin
[01:42:17] <megatrond> form.submit() and FF3.6
[01:42:22] <megatrond> any insights?
[01:42:27] <GreekFreak> xec, thank you
[01:43:23] <zabka> could i have same name for input field and textarea? causae wanna have name.change.. but it fails for textarea(=works only for input). is it becaue the names are same?
[01:43:40] <Trudko> Guys what's deal about change of attr and prop in 1.6.1 version? From what I understand there should not be any problem if I continue to use attr for example for checked. Its bit slower but thats all no?
[01:44:13] <Trudko> Problem was with1.6.0 where attr could return undefined when attr. checked was not set in html element no?
[01:44:26] <dinosaadeh> xec: even with $('[id^=row]') i am facing the same problem :(
[01:45:02] <xec> dinosaadeh: can you replicate the error in a pared-down testcase? see ?demo
[01:45:03] <bot-t> dinosaadeh, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:46:09] <topriddy> forgive me please, but i am having problem groking the difference between filter and find. they seem to meet the same purpose
[01:46:11] <megatrond> submitting a form with javascript doesnt seem to work in FF3.6. am i missing somethign obvious?
[01:47:45] <xec> topriddy: iirc filter looks at current element(s) in the set, while find looks for descendants elements
[01:48:18] <xec> topriddy: and by current i mean the root elements that are selected
[01:49:10] <dinosaadeh> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/dexL5/
[01:49:49] <robbington> Hey, I am having problems cloning an element, it has a click event attached to it, but this only clones once. So if the item is cloned, then clicked then cloned again, the click event is lost.
[01:50:04] <dinosaadeh> xec: i dont get it, in fiddle this is working!
[01:50:24] <Zogot> make sure you set the click event
[01:50:25] <Zogot> to on
[01:50:45] <robbington> When cloning it?
[01:51:11] <xec> dinosaadeh: i thought it might ;) are you 100% sure your code isn't included twice somehow?
[01:51:31] <Zogot> robbington: aye, the click that makes the clone, make sure its set to trigger off .on
[01:51:34] <Zogot> and not .click
[01:52:24] <dinosaadeh> xec: i will hang myself LOL
[01:52:52] <Zogot> robbington: if you also want it so only the new input can be clicked to make a new one, than take the old class off (the same class that triggers the clone) off the first element and move onto the new element
[01:52:54] <xec> i take it you found the bug, what was it?
[01:54:06] <dinosaadeh> xec: i am working in .Net MVC, the site.master included the JS and in the actual page i included the same file, u were right, THANKS!
[01:54:25] <xec> dinosaadeh: hehe you're welcome :)
[01:56:12] <Trudko> Guys what's deal about change of attr and prop in 1.6.1 version? From what I understand there should not be any problem if I continue to use attr for example for checked. Its bit slower but thats all no?
[01:56:15] <Trudko> Problem was with1.6.0 where attr could return undefined when attr. checked was not set in html element no?
[01:56:34] <GreekFreak> hey, I have the following CoffeeScript, but I cannot seem to get the image to show on the button ( http://www.pastie.org/2948679 ). So far no luck on google and I'm not sure if it's a rails issue (where the images are) or mu coffeescript
[01:57:11] <topriddy> xec: in this example starting from <p><a> </a></p> how does this make any difference?
[01:58:02] <zabka>  http://pastebin.com/5vdSt32e <-- wanna fire this when <textarea rows="10" cols="50" name="zt_update">1000059503</textarea> change.  have also this <input type="text" value="44" name="zt_update" id="QOT_HBCH_QOT_ID,2029529560" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> on the page. and may others inputs fields and textareas with name zt_update. the event is fired only for inputs fields
[01:58:21] <mgoeppner> GreekFreak: you including your images in /assets/images?
[01:59:05] <robbington> Zogot: Could you give me an example? Sorry noobish
[01:59:05] <GreekFreak> mgoeppner, yes but that changing the path to assets/images/myimage.gif didn't work either
[01:59:11] <xec> topriddy: lets say you have that paragraph in you selection and you do .filter("a") - you will have nothing left
[01:59:35] <mgoeppner> GreekFreak: don't include the /images in your path
[01:59:41] <GreekFreak> mgoeppner, I'm not sure if I should be using the images from the stylesheets that I added from the theme, in the images folder of the "stylesheets/images
[02:00:02] <xec> topriddy: make sense? :)
[02:00:07] <mgoeppner> GreekFreak: Don't include the images part of the path
[02:00:48] <mgoeppner> http://www.pastie.org/2948705
[02:00:53] <GreekFreak> mgoeppner, that doesn't work either. In fact neither does changeMonth: true, so i'm not sure if I'm going about this the wrong way
[02:01:26] <topriddy> xec: nope :(
[02:01:46] <topriddy> xec: i should still have <p>
[02:01:55] <topriddy> *scratches head* what am i saying
[02:02:43] <xec> topriddy: no, because you filtered out all root elements except those selections which match the filter, being "a", you would only be left with anchors that were root, no paragraphs
[02:03:06] <xec> topriddy: if you do .find("a"), you will get the <a> element
[02:06:09] <xec> topriddy: http://jsfiddle.net/4Jh2Z/
[02:06:48] <xec> topriddy: play around and look at console
[02:10:04] <mgoeppner> a interactive js console would be epic for JS fiddle.
[02:11:03] <Eviltwin> What
[02:11:04] <Eviltwin> ?
[02:11:19] <xec> mgoeppner: like the checkbox for firebug lite?
[02:11:34] <mgoeppner> sorta like the console in chrome's dev tools
[02:11:44] <Eviltwin> I have an idea
[02:11:47] <Eviltwin> Chrome's Dev Tools
[02:11:48] <Zogot> robbington: sorry for delay, only just saw, something like this should work http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/rn6VX/11/
[02:11:58] <xec> mgoeppner: choose jQuery (edge) and tick Firebug Lite
[02:12:43] <mgoeppner> Eviltwin: haha touche.
[02:13:02] <xec> topriddy, mgoeppner, Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/4Jh2Z/1/
[02:13:51] <mgoeppner> xec: damn... thanks for that tip!

[02:15:34] <xec> gotta love jsfiddle... when it's not slow
[02:15:39] <mgoeppner> haha
[02:19:16] <xro> Hi, i try to modify a button onclick attribute with jquery but it does not work. Can you take a look and help me?  a little example --> http://dpaste.com/664286/
[02:19:38] <Eviltwin> xro: Why are you using an onclick?
[02:19:58] <xro> Eviltwin, what should i use?
[02:20:00] <mgoeppner> $.click()
[02:20:16] <xec> .on('click',...)
[02:20:59] <xro> can you be a bit more explicit... i begin with Jquery....
[02:21:14] <mgoeppner> api.jquery.com
[02:21:20] <mgoeppner> use and abuse xro
[02:21:32] <xec> xro: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:21:44] <xec> nice long page :)
[02:22:07] <mgoeppner> good reading too :D
[02:23:27] <Ortund> anyone ever used QuickFlip? ( http://jonraasch.com/blog/quickflip-2-jquery-plugin )
[02:23:31] <xro> i'll read it... but i'm quite sure i wont find what i want
[02:23:56] <Ortund> for some reason, it's not animating the flip every time I click on the images it's supposed to do it on
[02:23:58] <xec> xro: well, what is it you're trying to achieve?
[02:24:15] <fusion5> hey, something very strange is going on with my script. i'm trying to use the cookie plugin. I keep track of the variable $.cookie is defined in the plugin .js file, but it's undefined in the actual html document. why?
[02:24:17] <mgoeppner> xro: are you trying to change the onclick event?
[02:24:39] <Zogot> aye it looks like it, but im unsure what exactly the onclick is supposed to do :p
[02:25:51] <xro> xec, i'm in a templating django environement... so i really need to change the onclick (because i only know the var1, var2.  var3 at a precise moment and they could change).. so i have to modify my button when i know the vars
[02:26:29] <techouse> man...why does Google take so long to update jQuery on their servers...
[02:26:38] <techouse> microsoft does it almost instantly :P
[02:26:51] <mgoeppner> xro: use the window global array to get your var.
[02:27:09] <mgoeppner> you can pass a string that you know at runtime.
[02:27:29] <mgoeppner> var apple = "apples!";
[02:27:33] <techouse> btw, someone change the topic from 1.7 to 1.7.1
[02:27:39] <mgoeppner> window["apple"].dosomething
[02:28:34] <xro> mgoeppner, yes, but my var change in the time... so it's much more easier to change the onclick when they change... Is there a way to change the onclick with attr(onclick, '????')
[02:28:52] <xec> xro: where do these variables come from?
[02:29:03] <ajpiano> i thought i did that yesterday
[02:29:17] <seutje> now I wish I could get a diff of that
[02:29:49] <Iszak> ajpiano: got ops?
[02:29:59] <ajpiano> i've had ops for 3 years
[02:30:05] <seutje> aren't u special
[02:30:07] <Iszak> ajpiano: change jQuery Mobile from RC2 to no RC
[02:30:08] <xro> xec, from a djano templating system... it's a bit complex...
[02:30:25] <xro> xec, no way to just update the attribut onclick????
[02:30:27] <mgoeppner> xro: bracket notation is your friend.
[02:30:52] <xec> xro: well, django is server side, right? so the variables will not change on client side after page is loaded?
[02:31:01] <xro> so, nobody will never answer my question?
[02:31:16] <mgoeppner> *facepalm*
[02:31:51] <xro> xec, the become links...  when i clique a link i have to change some vars in function of the link i clicked... and so on...
[02:32:05] <Iszak> that has been pissing me off for FAR too long.
[02:32:08] <Iszak> thanks ajpiano
[02:32:12] <ajpiano> lol np :)
[02:32:14] <mgoeppner> window["  + <put template code with the var name here> + "] xro
[02:33:02] <xro> Can you just say me how change the onclick attribut in my example please? --> mgoeppner>
[02:33:16] <seutje> xro: isn't the whole point of referencing reusable handlers so u don't get into this sort of shit?
[02:34:19] <beasty> mm
[02:34:20] <xro> i will take a while to explain all the problem... is ot possible to get an answer to my simple question without anything else?
[02:34:28] <beasty> anyone knows what happened to sean?
[02:34:44] <xec> xro: also, looking at that code, it seems you're setting the  onclick to exactly what it already was?
[02:35:36] <xec> xro: there is a reason people won't answer your question directly - we're trying to help you understand that your approach is a (very very) bad one, and so we suggest alternatives
[02:37:12] <xro> xec, yes maybe... but i'm not the guy in charge of web design... i just want to show a little proof of concept (bad coded isn't important)... just need it quickly... after that a web designer will do it right...
[02:37:35] <mgoeppner> *double facepalm*
[02:37:47] <fusion5> http://pastebin.com/7hZkpdSr -- please can anyone explain to me why this might be happening? first ($.cookie) is defined, but later it becomes undefined?
[02:39:10] <Eviltwin> fusion5: Do you include jQuery more than once?
[02:39:17] <Eviltwin> Do you have a jQuery.noConflict() somewhere?
[02:39:22] <Eviltwin> See if jQuery.cookie exists
[02:40:23] <fusion5> huh, yeah! it seems there's a script tag i missed that loads jquery the second time
[02:40:33] <fusion5> thanks a lot Eviltwin
[02:40:51] <mgoeppner> xro: we've given you multiple ways to make it work. And bad code is always important, because some poor fellow will have to read it. And reading bad code is like being mauled by a bear, especially if it has no comments.
[02:40:57] <klovni> anybody uses ff 8?
[02:41:16] <xec> mgoeppner: lol @ bear analogy
[02:41:49] <mgoeppner> xec: thanks. that convo was driving me insane -- round and round in circles we go :P
[02:41:53] <xec> aww he left
[02:41:54] <prodn> .keyup() doesn't seem to wait to long. if I echo or alert what's in the input, I don't get the last keystroke. What can I do?
[02:42:23] <klovni> there's this new web console thing in it to test js code and i was wondering is it possible to setup it so that it would load jquery library when it starts
[02:42:40] <klovni> it accepts to load it manually
[02:43:13] <Eviltwin> prodn: Not for me
[02:43:24] <Eviltwin> prodn: http://jsfiddle.net/4NPte/
[02:44:02] <nisseni> anyone has any experience with "not normal chars" with jquery - http://pastie.org/private/4oxlsw7cba7q4nywspes6w - all array objects work but "Byggår" and I think it's because it as "å" in it, the function should remove the array value from a field
[02:44:08] <xec> yeah, keyup should work. keydown or keypress would be early iirc
[02:44:21] <Eviltwin> klovni: Maybe something with this: http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[02:44:41] <mgoeppner> xec: keypress is flaky.
[02:44:45] <Ortund> could anyone tell me what the value of >>> var g = typeof (f) != "undefined" ? c(f) : c(".quickFlip"), h = g.children(); <<< would if .quickFlip is a div?
[02:45:20] <nisseni> bah, fixed it
[02:45:27] <Eviltwin> Ortund: We have no idea what the hell any of those variables are
[02:45:42] <xec> mgoeppner: i think that's the only one that triggers on every letter if you hold down a key, for instance
[02:45:43] <mgoeppner> ternary operators are epic.
[02:46:37] <xec> Ortund: do a console.log() ?
[02:46:42] <klovni> i guess this is more of ff issue, but they all sleep
[02:47:40] <mgoeppner> Ortund: it will return as object
[02:48:53] <Ortund> hmmm my problem is that this quickflip thing isn't animating the flip every time I click on the div...
[02:48:57] <Ortund> can't figure out why
[02:49:45] <mgoeppner> Ortund: infact that entire statement will only return object.
[02:50:16] <seutje> this is some serious psychic shit
[02:50:22] <mgoeppner> and the string object more preciesly
[02:50:47] <mgoeppner> so basically uyou are calling "object".children()
[02:50:58] <mgoeppner> or that is the value of h rather.
[02:51:05] <mgoeppner> i need coffee.
[02:51:46] <seutje> I think c is an alias for jQuery, that would make g a jQuery collection, albeit possibly empty
[02:51:56] <mgoeppner> wait. now i lost myself in that mess of code.
[02:52:06] <seutje> it all depends on f, rly
[02:52:19] <mgoeppner> *facepalm*
[02:52:36] <seutje> if f just happens to be "omgwtfbbqsauce", I guess it would be an empty collection
[02:52:58] <mgoeppner> im going to go pretend i'm an ostrich now.
[02:53:08] <seutje> I prolly shouldn't assume f is a string
[02:54:29] <mgoeppner> seutje: I misread stuff. lack of caffiene and tV shows distracting me.
[02:56:30] <seutje> why are u telling me this? o.O
[02:59:33] <robbington> Hey Zogot, thanks for that. Seem to be having a problem, can you take a look at my code?
[02:59:34] <robbington> http://pastebin.com/faAcNXTc
[03:00:32] <xeternal> how to
[03:01:17] <xeternal> how to .first return a valid object
[03:01:40] <xeternal> hi
[03:02:06] <xeternal> xeternal: how to know .first return a valid object
[03:08:18] <DotMH> Hay I am having issues understanding on and off , I am trying $(element).on('dblclick' , function(){}) and then $(element).off('dblckick'); but it doesnt seem to remove the event? Am I been really stupid?
[03:10:08] <dr0id> very stupid
[03:11:43] <DotMH> dr0id : ok any reason? I just notice the typo , but thats not in the code its both dblclick
[03:13:43] <Xotix> hi, how can i append a string to the action of a form?
[03:15:03] <DotMH> atkard : $(form).attr('action' , $(form).attr('action')+string); might work
[03:15:22] <prodn> I have two functions that runs when I put text in input field (.keyup), - I want to decide which function to run first. $(input).delay(3000).keyup( function () {...}); does not work
[03:15:28] <prodn> how can I make this right?
[03:15:35] <zabka> what is the opposite  to success in ajax
[03:15:37] <Xotix> i thought of somethign like that but it somehow looks strange. but okay
[03:16:53] <zabka> i have tried with failure:
[03:17:17] <lunchub> >zabka , error( callback) ?
[03:17:32] <zabka> lunchub: thanx! let me try
[03:20:22] <lunchub> $.ajax({url, somedata, success: func(), error: func() });  ajax events are here http
[03:20:30] <lunchub> http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax_Events
[03:20:56] <zabka> lunchub: many thanks! works fine

[03:32:44] <nFFF> Guys I want to insert some html into certain elements
[03:32:55] <luoluoluo> hi, there, I want to pass some value into callback of .keyup method.  I googled around and somebody said closure maybe help, but I just can't figure it out.  Here is my code, http://pastebin.com/qB3n2f1d
[03:33:02] <luoluoluo> hi, there, I want to pass some value into callback of .keyup method.  I googled around and somebody said closure maybe help, but I just can't figure it out.  Here is my code, http://pastebin.com/qB3n2f1d
[03:33:03] <nFFF> I need to check a certain elements child to see if it contains a keyword
[03:33:08] <nFFF> and if so, insert some html
[03:33:16] <nFFF> Any native jQuery functions avail. for this?
[03:33:40] <luoluoluo> any pros can help me?
[03:41:46] <zabka> one more question.. i have jetzt error: inside $.ajax. but... error is fired every time... even if no error occured
[03:41:53] <lunchub> luoluoluo: why trying .attr("value") twice? in this code
[03:43:01] <luoluoluo> lunchub: oh, that's a mistake. var _this = $("input#" + rule.id).attr("value"); should be var _this = $("input#" + rule.id);
[03:43:22] <luoluoluo> lunchub: but the function returned don't get called at all
[03:45:35] <nFFF> jQuery('product-name a:contains("Commander")') is this a valid selector?
[03:45:45] <lunchub> it seems does not need return function() only need inside code..
[03:46:01] <xec> nFFF: what is "product-name" ?
[03:46:04] <nFFF> a class
[03:46:12] <xec> nFFF: try prepending a .
[03:46:18] <nFFF> <div class="product-name">
[03:46:22] <nFFF> ah shit yea
[03:47:09] <lunchub> if you select css class it require '.'
[03:47:21] <xec> lunchub: you think so? :)
[03:47:52] <lunchub> oops you answered ;)
[03:57:36] <robbington> Hey, still having a few problems with cloning, I have written this code out, can someone have a look and tell me where I am going wrong?
[03:57:37] <robbington> http://pastebin.com/ukDGAEnL
[03:58:18] <zachsmith> robbington: what problem
[03:58:35] <t1m_> hey guys, a new problem: i need all images in the div with id="A" be draggable, those images are prepended to the div with id="A" after the complete page is loaded, when the user clicks on a button. These prepended images are not draggable then :(. is it because they are put there AFTER the page has loaded and the JS is initialized?
[03:59:05] <robbington> Zachsmith: Its not cloning the eleemtns events
[03:59:07] <robbington> elements
[03:59:45] <robbington> I thought that I could create a array with the original elements in them, then clone straight from that array
[04:00:03] <mparodi> Hello
[04:00:45] <mparodi> what am I doing wrong? $("[name=whatever]).change({anobject:example}, function(event, data) {console.log(data);}) ?
[04:00:51] <Ortund> can I write an html tag into a div by using something like document.getElementById('Div1').InnerHTML = "<a href="#">LINK</a>"; ?
[04:02:02] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/mdN9x/ anyone know why this isn t working?
[04:02:09] <zachsmith> robbington: where do you create the events?
[04:02:14] <Ortund> nFFF because it's broken?
[04:02:29] <zachsmith> Ortund: yes you can
[04:02:53] <zachsmith> but you should do $("#Div1").html("<a href="#">LINK</a>"); in jquery
[04:03:10] <robbington> In a plugin, that binds the click event for a zoom function, + adds data to each element so that it can change the main image to.
[04:03:21] <Ortund> ah, sweet, thanks zachsmith :)
[04:03:22] <nFFF> Ortund, ok... whats wrong with it...
[04:03:35] <zachsmith> robbington: try clone(true, true) :-/
[04:03:41] <Ortund> lol nFFF I'm just messing with you, sorry m8
[04:03:47] <zachsmith> robbington: wait, what jquery are you using
[04:04:45] <zachsmith> nFFF: the problem is that you A) can't do multi line string in JS B) you can't have quotes inside of quotes with doing \"
[04:05:14] <nFFF> ok whats the easiest way to solve this
[04:05:19] <nFFF> create a var with the html in
[04:05:42] <robbington> no, that doesnt fix it.
[04:05:45] <robbington> :(
[04:06:03] <nFFF> Is there no easy way of adding it?
[04:06:48] <robbington> Do you mean version?
[04:07:54] <robbington> 1.5.1 min
[04:10:09] <zachsmith> robbington: yeah, huh
[04:10:11] <zachsmith> idk
[04:13:08] <robbington> Zachsmith, would it be because the click event is bound to the a tag inside the li, and I am only cloning the li?
[04:13:42] <zachsmith> robbington: it should do both
[04:13:56] <zachsmith> robbington: if it doesn't you should report that as a bug I think
[04:15:07] <robbington> I think it has to be to do with how I am getting the li in the first place, I did have it to a point where it would clone once, then if the click event was fired on the element i would lose it after the next clone.
[04:15:11] <robbington> So the clone is working
[04:15:23] <bonhoffer> i'm trying to build a datepicker to select multiple dates in a specific range
[04:15:32] <bonhoffer> is this a better solution http://www.eyecon.ro/datepicker/#about
[04:15:43] <bonhoffer> it looks different than the jquery ui datepicker
[04:16:04] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/mdN9x/ anyone know how to fix this easily
[04:16:13] <nFFF> Just want to addd a block of html
[04:19:13] <Ortund> If I click on an image, I want jquery to change another image on the screen (sort of like a gallery, how should I tell jquery which image to change to?
[04:20:20] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/mdN9x/1/
[04:21:46] <robbington> Ortund: var mainImage = $(YourMainImage); $(imagetochangeto).click(function(){  var newimage = $(this).attr('src');MainImage.attr('src', newimage) })
[04:21:51] <robbington> something like that anyhoo
[04:23:52] <mparodi> what's wrong with $("[name=whatever]).change({anobject:example}, function(event, data) {console.log(data);}) ?
[04:24:07] <xec> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/mdN9x/2/
[04:24:20] <xec> can't have multiline strings afaik
[04:24:42] <mparodi> besides the typo after "whatever]" :P
[04:24:45] <xec> apart from escaping the line break which is bad
[04:24:59] <Ortund> robbington, how do I use that with a click on my thumbnail?
[04:25:13] <robbington> Pastebin you code Ortund
[04:25:28] <nFFF> xec, thanks alot
[04:25:35] <nFFF> Was jsut looking at .html
[04:25:43] <Ortund> I don't have any yet, still trying to understand how to fit this into jquery
[04:25:46] <nFFF> whats the difference between append and html in this case
[04:25:51] <nFFF> .append() .html()
[04:25:58] <xec> nFFF: the alot says "you're welcome" http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html
[04:26:17] <nFFF> :>
[04:26:40] <xec> .html() will replace any existing content
[04:32:00] <robbington> Ortund: http://pastebin.com/NXq7Zbqe
[04:33:02] <robbington> Ortund: Looking over it there are a few spelling mistakes, but should give you an idea
[04:33:06] <mparodi> I don't see why I can't do .change({object}, handler) and I can do .bind("change", {object}, handler). is it some kind of bug?
[04:33:06] <robbington> Now
[04:33:11] <robbington> Anyone on Cloning/
[04:33:12] <robbington> ?
[04:38:26] <robbington> Ortund, thinking about it, what I posted was cap and would never work. Here is a better version. http://pastebin.com/NryHaMsA
[04:40:27] <Ortund> That's brilliant robbington :) lemme paste what I came up with... it's not nearly as elegant
[04:41:01] <_shawn> Hello
[04:41:26] <_shawn> It is possible to access a function that is inside a plugin even if it starts with an underscore?
[04:41:35] <dAnjou> what does that do? var cache = {}, lastXhr;
[04:41:41] <dAnjou> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[04:42:05] <Ortund> robbington: http://pastebin.com/GpRaTupu
[04:42:09] <Ortund> thats what I came up with
[04:42:11] <dAnjou> meaning this javascript syntax
[04:42:32] <crab> it declares a variable named cache, initialises it to {}, and a different variable named lastXhr and doesn't initialise it.
[04:42:50] <_shawn> basically I have a plugin with a function called _transition and I want to call it from outside the plugin. Is that possible?
[04:43:12] <dAnjou> oh .. oh damn, thanks. i totally misread that -.-". shame on me
[04:43:16] <Cork> _shawn: your using the factory?
[04:43:22] <crab> shawn: not unless the plugin cooperates by adding an entry point for the function
[04:43:54] <_shawn> Cork I am using a slider plugin, this one: http://jstnjns.com/jquery/slider/
[04:44:32] <crab> or unless you modify the plugin to cooperate thus
[04:44:37] <_shawn> crab: I see. What does an entry point look like? Do you mean another method that would allow me to call the function?
[04:45:24] <Cork> _shawn: _transation is a local variable to that scope, so no you can't call it
[04:45:49] <Cork> _ prefixed functions doesn't automatically have any special meaning
[04:46:15] <crab> shawn: yes. jquery plugins often do something like $(blah).plugin("somefunc", ...args...) or similar
[04:46:18] <_shawn> Cork: That is what I was afraid of. What is the easiest way to change that?
[04:46:19] <Cork> it only have if a factory type framework removes functions with _ in the beginning
[04:46:38] <Cork> _shawn: the only way would be to hack the plugin
[04:46:45] <robbington> Ortund: You would need to put $("main_image").html() etc inside the click event, and personally I would declare the targetIamge var inside the function and not in the global scope, but up to you.
[04:47:02] <Cork> _shawn: you would have to expose the function with a function name on its external interface
[04:47:09] <_shawn> Cork: Exactly. I think I understand how to do it now. It should be relatively easy right? Like crab was saying.
[04:47:34] <Ortund> robbington, all in all I do very little work in jquery so I defer to your expertise :D I'm fumbling in the dark here so to speak
[04:48:17] <Cork> _shawn a simple this.translation = _translation; at line 367 should do it
[04:49:28] <_shawn> Cork: Thank you so much, time and time again IRC has saved me on a deadline. You guys rock.
[04:50:03] <robbington> Ortund: Thats cool, thats what these Irc's are about. :)
[04:50:18] <Ortund> exactly :) thanks for the help
[04:51:00] <robbington> Anytime. Now cloning! Anyone? I am dying on my arse here.
[04:51:12] <Ortund> lol
[04:59:47] <Ortund> hmmm robbington, it doesn't change the image
[05:02:03] <robbington> Ortund: Fun debig times, write in a alert('test'); into your click function to make sure its working
[05:02:40] <Ortund> I have a feeling the click is hitting the image rather than the hyperlink
[05:03:13] <robbington> is the image wrapped in a <a> tag?
[05:04:58] <nFFF> Ive got a dynamic page, when it first loads jQuery .append() works fine on elements of the page
[05:05:18] <nFFF> When an ajax call is made and new eleemnts are loaded
[05:05:23] <nFFF> the .append() isnt being called
[05:05:31] <Ortund> the alert worked
[05:06:11] <robbington> Prob this line, $("#main_image").html("<img src=" + targetImage + " />");
[05:06:11] <Ortund> haha I was targetting the wrong control for the target newSrc
[05:06:37] <robbington> go for $("#main_image").attr('src', targetImage);
[05:07:08] <robbington> or sorry
[05:07:15] <robbington> $("#main_image img").html("<img src=" + targetImage + " />");
[05:07:26] <robbington> I mean $("#main_image img").attr('src', targetImage);
[05:07:40] <Pawka> Question to folks who are using jquery tools: how can I extend api?
[05:08:37] <robbington> Wait a min, there isnt a image in the html to attach the new src to. I see what you were doing. Sorry been a long day
[05:09:51] <robbington> That should do it: $("#main_image img").prepend("<img src=" + targetImage + " />");
[05:10:02] <robbington> That should do it: $("#main_image").prepend("<img src=" + targetImage + " />");
[05:10:12] <Ortund> no worries robbington, I fixed it. #main_image was wrong
[05:12:50] <Spadeski> Hey how can I create a simple stylish progrress bar w/o plugin ?
[05:13:29] <mgoeppner> Spadeski: layer two divs, and scale the top one
[05:14:03] <Spadeski> mgoeppner:  Got that done now any place I can get stylish images for it /
[05:18:17] <Ortund> how can I create a counter to use when showing/hiding collections of elements on the page?
[05:19:05] <Ortund> so if my div id is "row1" then, i should target #('row' + i) and increment it as necessary depending on which collection I'm on ... 1, 2, 3, etc
[05:19:31] <Ortund> err... I should target $('#row' + i) rather
[05:26:40] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/EcGWNTj0         <<< what am I doing wrong here?
[05:26:51] <Ortund> erm... hang on
[05:27:12] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/GBF1s6pQ       <<< that's better
[05:27:48] <erichynds> Ortund: row.css("display", "none")
[05:27:54] <erichynds> or simply use hide()
[05:28:08] <Hectrosito20> Hi
[05:28:32] <Hectrosito20> i want to learn about jQuery
[05:28:55] <Cork> erichynds: a not of warning though, .hide does more then display: none
[05:29:04] <xec> Hectrosito20: http://www.learningjquery.com/
[05:29:08] <GreekFreak> I am trying to display an image of the button of the datepicker (jQuery). For some reason I still see the elipses. Any advice? http://www.pastie.org/2949325
[05:29:15] <Cork> erichynds: it saves its current display type so .show can reset it
[05:29:20] <erichynds> exactly
[05:29:38] <erichynds> more reason to use it.
[05:29:42] <Cork> ya
[05:29:56] <Hectrosito20> Hi @Cork
[05:30:54] <Ortund> thanks erichynds, but it still isn't working (I went for the hide() option)
[05:31:25] <erichynds> make sure your selectors are matching elements, Ortund
[05:32:01] <Ortund> erichynds: as in '#row' + (i + 1) ?
[05:32:08] <erichynds> yes, but console.log the jquery object
[05:32:11] <Cork> Orphis: your sure you want children and not .find?
[05:32:12] <erichynds> and make sure there's something in there
[05:32:27] <Cork> children only looks at direct children
[05:32:31] <Hectrosito20> someone can give a good library jQuery
[05:32:33] <Cork> not child children
[05:32:37] <erichynds> also, since you're selecting elems by ID anyway, just do $("#row" + i) or whatever
[05:32:43] <erichynds> no need to use find/children/etc
[05:32:55] <Cork> true
[05:34:03] <Hectrosito20> Who can help me?
[05:34:24] <Cork> Hectrosito20: good library to do what?
[05:34:40] <Hectrosito20> Cork to make nice effect..
[05:34:59] <Cork> like?
[05:35:13] <Cork> effects is part of core, no need for extra plugins
[05:35:15] <Hectrosito20> i dont know much about this, im just learning about this...
[05:35:44] <Hectrosito20> yeah but Core where can i get more information..
[05:36:06] <Hectrosito20> cus you know that is not easy to white code if u dont know how to type it
[05:36:06] <Ortund> erichynds : console.log(row); is returning [] in Chrome
[05:36:17] <Hectrosito20> i mean write=whiteç
[05:37:19] <Cork> Orphis: var row = $('#row' + i);
[05:37:44] <Hectrosito20> Cork, thats form me....
[05:38:08] <Cork> Hectrosito20: i don't know what your looking for
[05:38:19] <Ortund> Cork >> var row = $('#thumbs').children('#row' + i);
[05:38:31] <Cork> Ortund: replace that line
[05:38:36] <Hectrosito20> im looking to learn about jQuery and his power...
[05:38:43] <Cork> Ortund: id's are uniq no need for the extra selector
[05:38:53] <Cork> Hectrosito20: you've already gotten a link
[05:38:54] <GreekFreak> My buttonImage on my datepicker is not showing. I only get ellipses. Could someone please explain why?
[05:39:16] <Hectrosito20> what link Corck?

[05:39:37] <Hectrosito20> Thank Cork
[05:39:55] <Cork> thank xec it was he ho gave it
[05:40:43] <Hectrosito20> Cork, can i ask you another question?
[05:41:05] <Cork> just ask
[05:41:18] <xec> Cork: I think he likes you :)
[05:41:28] <Cork> might be so >_>
[05:41:37] <noobie25> when using .extend is necessary to append the "a" as shown a.extend(d,b) in the following code?  http://pastie.org/2949487
[05:42:25] <Cork> ugg single letter variable names...
[05:42:53] <noobie25> sorry
[05:43:05] <Hectrosito20> Cork is correctly to use Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 to implement jQuery? but i would see some sample of jQuery working on it..ç
[05:43:23] <noobie25> i copied a code from elsewhere and trying to understand it.  i'm new to jquery.
[05:43:24] <Jon47> a guy in my 9th grade Pascal class named all his variables after civil war generals
[05:43:39] <Cork> noobie25: jquery inherrits .extend and it adds it self to it by default
[05:43:52] <Cork> noobie25: if that was your question
[05:44:32] <Cork> Hectrosito20: just google for jquery tutorial, should be quite some links
[05:44:55] <Cork> Jon47: thats basically just as bad
[05:45:08] <Jon47> yea but funnier
[05:45:25] <Jon47> I think pascal gets compiled
[05:45:26] <Cork> a variable name with with no meaning could just as well just be a memory address
[05:45:33] <Hectrosito20> ohh  ok that happen is that my english is not good, im from Domincan Republic...
[05:45:34] <Cork> it is
[05:45:51] <noobie25> Cork: does that mean in line 8 (http://pastie.org/2949487)  var d appended all the key/values from var b.   additionally, since jquery inherits .extend ... it also modifies a?
[05:47:29] <Pawka> Can someone look at this: https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/blob/master/src/rangeinput/rangeinput.js
[05:47:42] <Pawka> How can I add additional method to api?
[05:47:43] <Ortund> Cork: I know id's are unique. The thing is, each row is named "row1", "row2", "row3", etc.
[05:47:43] <Cork> noobie25: what line 8 does is copy b into d
[05:47:59] <Cork> noobie25: and then sets b to d
[05:48:00] <Pawka> I mean extending it somehow.
[05:48:08] <Ortund> but it works if I use good old getElementById();
[05:48:25] <noobie25> Cork: can i just $.extend(d,b)   i'm not sure why it was coded a.extend(d,b)
[05:48:27] <Cork> Ortund: your sure i is 1 at first and not 0 ?
[05:48:46] <Cork> noobie25: yes, as the documentation says
[05:49:03] <Cork> jQuery.extend( target [, object1] [, objectN] )
[05:49:17] <Jon47> noobie25 when you see single letter variable names like that it usually means the names got munged by a minification program like YUICompressor to save bytes in bandwidth.  it also means it's hella hard to read ..
[05:49:19] <Ortund> Cork, yes, because I set it that way
[05:49:29] <Ortund> var i = 1;
[05:49:33] <noobie25> Cork:  i'm trying the figure out why a prev developer might have coded it this way.  Any suggestions?
[05:50:11] <noobie25> Jon47: ohhh.   maybe the minification process made it this way?
[05:50:11] <Cork> noobie25: is that simplified code, or is that really how it looks?
[05:50:52] <Cork> ya, thats quite likly
[05:51:21] <noobie25> Cork: i removed a lot of code, but did not rename anything.  Jon47 suggested it was run through a minification program.  So i'm thinking maybe the minification program coded it that way?
[05:51:32] <Jon47> minification doesn't re-program
[05:51:44] <Jon47> it just removes whitespace and renames variables within a scope
[05:52:31] <ibike365> good mornin'
[05:53:32] <noobie25> Jon47: so it wouldn't add the "a" to a.extend(d,b).
[05:53:47] <noobie25> Jon47: say..... if it originally read  $.extend(d,b)
[05:54:26] <Jon47> noobie25 what i'm saying is, it SEEMS like a is just a pointer to $
[05:54:29] <Jon47> which is a pointer to jquery
[05:54:41] <Jon47> so a.extend is literally the same as $.extend
[05:55:11] <Ortund> my thumbnails suck, how can I get them all to the same size?
[05:55:38] <Jon47> just make them 5 megabytes each and use height/width attributes to resize them, boya!
[05:56:08] <Ortund> 5mb each? are you mad? lol
[05:56:26] <ibike365> Ok make them 6
[05:56:44] <Ortund> can't tell if trolling or just stupid lol
[05:57:07] <ibike365> I was wondering the same thing
[05:57:12] <noobie25> Jon47: thanks for clearing that up.   i'm a noob to jquery and just wondering why the developer just didn't use $.extend(d,b) unless that is some standard practice to use the pointer.
[05:57:28] <Jon47> np
[05:57:36] <noobie25> Jon47:  thx!
[05:57:46] <Jon47> and yes, just trolling ;)
[05:57:50] <noobie25> Cork:  thanks to you too.
[05:58:18] <Ortund> Jon47 : yeah, but there wasn't a meme for "I know you're trolling me RUS FOH DAH"
[05:58:24] <Ortund> so used "can't tell"
[05:58:37] <noobie25> what's trolling
[05:58:44] <noobie25> j/k
[05:58:56] <noobie25> o.0
[05:59:03] <Ortund> it's something cool people do to make everyone else like them even more
[06:05:12] <hackeron> hey, question - I have a bunch of draggable boxes and I set a high zIndex number on them, but they still appear bellow all other elements when dragged, any ideas? < this is the page: http://monitor.xanview.com/live
[06:06:39] <tajen> hackeron: z-index is relative to an elements rendering context. Read up on it.
[06:07:05] <hackeron> tajen: ok, so what's the solution?
[06:07:51] <tajen> I dont know what the solution is, but that is probably your problem :)
[06:08:11] <hackeron> tajen: I know it is, but I don't know how to solve it
[06:08:38] <hackeron> tajen: if I change the position attribute of the parent element, the rendering breaks
[06:08:46] <tajen> then try #css, because this is not a javascript/jquery problem
[06:08:48] <SugaSlide> hackeron chances are your dragging thing is a clone / helper
[06:09:02] <SugaSlide> so the css applied to the origional might not apply to the dragging item
[06:09:14] <SugaSlide> use firebug or something and watch what gets added
[06:09:19] <hackeron> SugaSlide: I apply the css to the dragging element, check with firebug
[06:11:27] <SugaSlide> hackeron i dont think im getting the right result...

[06:20:08] <nFFF> i.e. the jQuery isnt working
[06:20:09] <nFFF> any idea
[06:30:13] <SugaSlide> hackeron - soz dude.. cant figure out wtf.. boss on my case now so soz again :(

[06:32:13] <tman-> why is it when i do someething like $(selector).css('opacity')+.1 it outputs the string 0.5.1 instead of .6 ?
[06:32:27] <tman-> i tried puttting that into a parseInt and it still failes
[06:32:30] <tman-> fails*
[06:33:15] <tman-> does .css('opacity') not return a number or something?
[06:35:12] <tman-> needed parseFLoat, thx.

[06:49:49] <Dykotomee> Good morning, JSland.
[06:50:18] <Dykotomee> Who here has heard of "growl?" or jquery's "purr" plugin?
[06:50:21] <Dykotomee> http://jsfiddle.net/Vg6xY/
[06:50:35] <Dykotomee> Something's quirky w/it.
[06:50:37] <Dykotomee> Don't know what.
[06:50:54] <Dykotomee> The setDefaults method isn't returning what it's supposed to.
[06:51:03] <Dykotomee> It- oh my gosh...
[06:51:09] <Dykotomee> Wow, I'm a moron.
[06:51:14] <Dykotomee> Thanks all.

[06:52:22] <robbington> Any know how to return grab a section of a string using regex in jquery?
[06:52:58] <djQuery> nFFF: working for me
[06:53:49] <djQuery> nFFF: chrome 17
[06:54:41] <djQuery> robbington: do you have an example of the string?
[06:57:46] <truuujc> hey people, I am looking for a best practice / fastest way of taking a DIV, and checking which children of that div were closest to a mouse clock event location. (their centers)
[06:57:59] <robbington> djQuery: Its reurned as attached data(). So looks like data-gallery="{gallery: 'thumb' smallimg:"example.jpg", largeimg:examplelarge.jpg}"
[06:58:02] <truuujc> I've been looking at www.acko.net/files/mouse-positioning.html
[06:58:17] <Ortund> If I cycle to #row3 and I only have #row1 and row2, my "previous" button doesn't go back: http://pastebin.com/dDuMuVH0
[06:58:29] <robbington> I need to get to the large image, was thinking I would use a regex to grab the one I want.
[06:59:27] <truuujc> which is fairly old code - so center x,y is top+(height/2) and same with width. get event, and iterate through all the children, but is there a faster, more core jquery way that is cached or something?
[06:59:28] <djQuery> robbington: do you have access to the source? well it should just be accessable as $(data).data('smallimg') then
[06:59:29] <robbington> This is actually the string data-gallery="{gallery: 'thumb', smallimage: 'http://0522231919.jpg',largeimage: 'http://0522231919.jpg'}"

[07:02:15] <djQuery> robbington: how are you getting the string?
[07:03:43] <djQuery> are you allready plucking that out of soemthing else?    $('<div '+ string +'></div>').data('largeimage');
[07:07:15] <lodott> I have an element which I want to use .hasData on, in a click handler. But it seems that after the click .hasData suddenly is true, even if false before the click
[07:07:32] <lodott> http://jsfiddle.net/kuni/ZBVSC/1/ , click foo once
[07:07:49] <berndj> what sort of error reporting paradigm do you folk use to tell $.post and friends that something bad happened? I'd like to simply return 404 Not found, but the ajax shorthand methods simply ignore such responses
[07:08:50] <lodott> I am likely making a very stupid mistake, but this is driving me crazy
[07:09:03] <berndj> i've taken to 200 OK + print(json_encode(FALSE)), but it grates me that HTTP provides specific status codes for the errors, but they're de fact unavailable to use
[07:18:37] <AngryAsian> hi john
[07:18:45] <littlebigbot> hey
[07:18:50] <AngryAsian> ah goody
[07:18:56] <AngryAsian> so yeah ask around here whenever
[07:19:09] <littlebigbot> k, cool.
[07:19:41] <littlebigbot> where do i purchase this "jquery" thing, is it at walmart?
[07:21:02] <berndj> lodott, that's just weird, but i'm going to pretend i never saw that in order to avoid going crazy
[07:23:24] <GreekFreak> Hi. (rails3.1) I have been battling for hours in trying to display the buttonImage on my datepicker ( http://www.pastie.org/2949897 ). I have tried putting the file in various locations, including assuming that jquery has it's own images somewhere. Any saviours will be greatly appreciated :)
[07:23:26] <lodott> berndj: coward ;)
[07:23:46] <AngryAsian> lodott show me :o  I missed out on this crazy thing
[07:23:57] <lodott> http://jsfiddle.net/kuni/ZBVSC/1/
[07:24:09] <lodott> click foo
[07:24:30] <lodott> I do not assgn any data, but hasData seems to change its value on its own
[07:24:55] <lodott> or rather via click
[07:41:03] <Mkop> anyone here familiar with the jstree plugin, and know if there's a way to make it collapse a folder if I open a sibling of that folder?
[07:41:38] <Mkop> (the equivalent of dynatree's autocollapse)
[07:43:41] <tman-> Is there a way to for index.html to appear in the browser's address bar?
[07:44:29] <tman-> like i'm trying to return the name of the .html file into a variable, which works fine, unless it's index, where i have to implicitly write index.html into the address bar to get it to work.
[07:44:35] <tman-> otherise it just returns an empty string.
[07:44:57] <timing> tman-: you can just type index.html in the addressbar
[07:45:38] <tman-> timing: that's what i'm saying, i'm trying to get aroud that
[07:45:52] <tman-> because ultimately, i don't want to have to rely on the user inputting that.
[07:46:09] <tman-> and it won't always be .html it coudl be .cfm, .php, .asp, etc
[07:46:17] <timing> if( file == '' ) { file == 'index.html' } ?
[07:46:24] <timing> oh shit :-)
[07:46:28] <tman-> hmmm
[07:46:33] <tman-> that's actually ok timing
[07:46:34] <tman-> i'm splutting it
[07:46:37] <timing> ok
[07:46:40] <tman-> and returning [0]
[07:46:45] <tman-> so that will work.
[07:46:50] <tman-> thanks!
[07:46:50] <timing> ok awsesome
[07:58:13] <kanzie> Im  having major problems with localStorage in Chrome, starting to think its a bug. I have an array, I JSON.stringify it and store. Later I try to add a new value to this by taking what is stored, do a parse, push() new value and then add it again. It works a random amount of times, but after a while starts to add a ", which next time it escapes \" and this grows incrementally… after a bit I have \\\\\\\\""\\\"\\ etc.

[08:00:46] <mrittman> Hey, I have a function that hides 2 divs. How can I make it so that it hides 1 div and then the other?
[08:00:54] <djQuery> anyone familar with kendoui? having problems with kendo grid loading the data http://jsbin.com/oquxuk/43/edit
[08:01:04] <mrittman> http://pastebin.com/XPmq6dbC
[08:02:02] <djQuery> mrittman: see ?toggle
[08:02:02] <bot-t> mrittman, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[08:02:10] <XMan2012> I am looking for  a jquery plugin for notification system just like on this following example(http://blogs.hbr.org/taylor/2011/11/dont_let_what_you_know_limit_w.html) ..... there are always something notify on the right bottom of the page...
[08:03:01] <djQuery> mrittman: k just looked at the code and you are using toggle   is one already show and the other isnt?
[08:03:39] <mrittman> djQuery, it does them both at the same time
[08:04:00] <mrittman> how can I first hide the arrow, then hide the dialog?
[08:04:01] <djQuery> mrittman: so you want to wait till one is hidden before showing the other?
[08:04:14] <mrittman> sorry I guess I wasn't very clear
[08:05:05] <maZtah> how to add an <option> to a selectbox and make it selected?
[08:05:16] <djQuery> mrittman: $('.arrow').slideToggle('slow', function(){$('.dialog').slideToggle('slow');})
[08:05:31] <maZtah> so far i have this: $("#id_certificate").append("<option value='16'>test</option>");
[08:05:39] <maZtah> but now i need to really 'select' it
[08:05:45] <mrittman> so you click a button and I want it to hide the dialog, then hide the arrow. If you click a button again, I want it to show the arrow, then the dialog
[08:06:06] <mrittman> cool man I'll give that a go :)
[08:06:20] <djQuery> mrittman: you need to use slideToggles callback function
[08:06:34] <mrittman> oh really
[08:09:38] <djQuery> maZtah: is the option being added correctly?
[08:09:44] <maZtah> yes
[08:10:41] <djQuery> maZtah: $("#id_certificate").append("<option value='16'>test</option>").val('16');
[08:10:58] <maZtah> aah, okay, thanks djQuery
[08:11:06] <mrittman> thanks djQuery!
[08:12:14] <ibike365> anyone watching the kendo ui launch webinar?

[08:14:47] <ibike365> jdQuery i've only messed with it a tiny bit
[08:15:20] <ibike365> *djQuery I mean :)
[08:15:44] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to use the :last-child selector and I'm getting some unexpected behavior. I have <div class="colors"><div class="color"/><div class="new"/></div> and .colors > .color:last-child doesn't return anything, when .new isn't in there it works fine. Is this how it's supposed to work?
[08:16:53] <ablomen> BillCriswell, that's because with .new there its not the last child
[08:17:05] <ablomen> use :last to get the last of type .color
[08:17:13] <BillCriswell> ablomen: Ahhhh.
[08:17:36] <BillCriswell> I'd assume :last-child of .color when I read that. Thanks though.
[08:17:37] <maZtah> thanks djQuery: works like a charm!
[08:19:57] <lodott> any one has a idea why clicking seems to assign data to an element? http://jsfiddle.net/kuni/ZBVSC/1/
[08:21:23] <lodott> is there a way to display the full contents of element-assigned data, instead of just one key at a time?
[08:24:27] <djQuery> lodott: sounds like a big
[08:24:32] <djQuery> *bug
[08:24:52] <beasty> lol a big
[08:24:58] <gnarf> lodott: .data() returns the whole data object
[08:25:05] <beasty> big = small pig in dutch :p
[08:25:26] <gnarf> and .hasData() returns true because the element has an event handler attached
[08:25:30] <beasty> also big  = big in english
[08:25:30] <beasty> :p
[08:25:44] <gnarf> lodott: http://jsfiddle.net/ZBVSC/3/
[08:26:32] <lodott> gnarf: ah, thanks. Is that documented somewhere?
[08:26:52] <gnarf> lodott: hasData() isn't really a function thats super useful outside of the actual data module
[08:27:12] <gnarf> but events uses the internal data cache to store handlers
[08:28:42] <lodott> good to know, that
[08:29:11] <gnarf> as far as documentation goes, I'm not really sure where we would write anything about that
[08:29:56] <lodott> in the description of .data() and friends, seems like a good spot to me
[08:30:42] <lodott> or rather .hasData(): I didn't expect internal structure to use the data container, so that would have helped me
[08:30:57] <gnarf> hasData() just checks to see if there is a data cache on the object
[08:31:31] <gnarf> we have an "internal cache" that is used by quite a few things - keys are used in the .data() object, but instead in a $._data() private method
[08:31:43] <gnarf> but they still create the data cache
[08:32:25] <lodott> yeah, I have looked at the source regarding data storage, but it was too complicated to quickly understand what happens there
[08:33:31] <gnarf> $.hasData( elem ) is meant to be a way for you to check if there is a data cache, so you can $.hasData( elem ) && $.data( elem, key )
[08:33:46] <gnarf> to avoid creating a new data object on an element that didn't already have one
[08:34:18] <lodott> right. What I did not expect was, that someone else besides me uses this data cache
[08:36:37] <lodott> I am not sure if it is worth it, but this could be mentioned in the doc. On the other hasData appeared only twice in the complete channel log for last month, so it does not seem to generate a lot of interest :)
[08:36:49] <squire_> hey ho, event bubbling only goes up the DOM tree right? if there is a sibling DOM element that happens to be behind the element you click, and the event was in the element bounds, the event won't include that element as it bubbles up right?
[08:38:04] <gnarf> lodott: like i said, its not meant to be a function you use very often
[08:38:26] <gnarf> its more to stop you from creating a data object where one doesn't already exist
[08:38:38] <gnarf> it also will return true if there is PRIVATE data on the object
[08:39:09] <gnarf> so .data() could be an "empty object" and .hasData() still returns true
[08:39:15] <lodott> well, I leave it to you how you want to handle it in the doc, I am just happy that I understand what is happening now :)
[08:39:56] <gnarf> lodott: i asked kswedberg to think on it and gave him a summary of our conversation, i'm not sure what the right way to document it would be, but he's a wizard with docs :)
[08:40:42] <lodott> hey, may be he will change it, then I will be famous because I initiated it ;)
[08:40:47] <kswedberg> haha. thx for that, gnarf. :) Yeah, I'll think on it
[08:42:07] <lodott> Thanks for the insight, now its back to experimenting with jQuery..
[08:42:38] <clockwize> hey, I'm adding elements on the fly (in some code somewhere else) and I want some code executed when an element is added with a certain class - is that possible?
[08:42:53] <ravenzz> be careful, It could explode
[08:42:53] <clockwize> I want the class to auto hook itself up to the element when it's created..
[08:43:31] <ravenzz> ?livequery @ clockwize
[08:43:32] <bot-t> clockwize, Plugins/livequery - Live Query utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[08:43:52] <clockwize> cool, thanks
[08:43:57] <gnarf> ravenzz: i should kick your ass for suggesting that plugin
[08:44:04] <ravenzz> asfijqwe
[08:44:13] <gnarf> its horrible
[08:44:40] <andrew9183> i am not having a good coding day today
[08:44:42] <andrew9183> anyone ever have those
[08:44:50] <gnarf> clockwize: I've spent a little time thinking about this problem - see ?newContent
[08:44:50] <bot-t> clockwize, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[08:44:51] <ravenzz> I see some people suggesting that plugin here
[08:44:57] <gnarf> ravenzz: kick their ass
[08:44:59] <gnarf> :)
[08:45:02] <ravenzz> :p
[08:45:03] <ravenzz> sorry
[08:45:43] <gnarf> clockwize: basically, the best thing you can do is write "plugin" on $.fn that you call on your content as you add it
[08:45:54] <gnarf> it can do the .find( ".myclass" ) and attach whatever
[08:46:09] <clockwize> then how does livejquery work?
[08:46:24] <ravenzz> I'll write it down on my stuffs.txt
[08:46:36] <gnarf> clockwize: livequery will poll the entire dom every ___ ms for your new content, and/or hack itself into all jQuery domManipulation
[08:46:44] <gnarf> its VERY wasteful to do it that way
[08:46:54] <clockwize> i'm happy for it to do that on domManipulation..
[08:47:03] <gnarf> clockwize: no you aren't
[08:47:16] <clockwize> I am, honest.
[08:47:26] <gnarf> clockwize: you might think you are, but it causes a lot of wasted performance in those functions
[08:47:41] <gnarf> its MUCH easier to just call a plugin you write whenever you add new content
[08:47:51] <ravenzz> it is
[08:48:03] <clockwize> meh
[08:48:06] <gnarf> its also WAY faster
[08:48:10] <gnarf> and less wasteful
[08:48:15] <clockwize> i'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
[08:48:21] <ravenzz> I wasn't aware about how livequery works
[08:48:30] <gnarf> livequery = the devil = kills unicorns
[08:48:41] <Jon47> i haven't used it but wouldn't newContent obfuscate what's actually happening to the new content and make the code harder to understand as you read it?  why not just scope the callback method so that you can execute it on the new content..
[08:48:42] <xec> awww, but unicorns are so pretty!
[08:48:45] <gnarf> i would banish it from the internet if i had the power
[08:48:58] <ravenzz> you can remove it from the bawt
[08:49:18] <mgoeppner> xec: unicorn meat is tasty.
[08:49:47] <gnarf> Jon47: thats what that plugin does
[08:50:03] <gnarf> Jon47: i use that newContent pattern on a lot of my sites now
[08:50:12] <gnarf> although I think I've tweaked it a little
[08:50:30] <gnarf> the core concept is still the same
[08:50:31] <xec> mgoeppner: like eating rainbows!
[08:50:52] <mgoeppner> xec: totally rad!
[08:51:33] <gnarf> ravenzz: this is why we don't suggest using livequery, people hear about it and the lazy gene sneaks in, and then everyones page starts querying the dom in the background
[08:51:41] <kborchers> hey gnarfsy
[08:51:49] <gnarf> mornin kborchers
[08:51:53] <kborchers> ?livequery

[08:52:03] <kborchers> i told him to forget that
[08:52:25] <gnarf> bot-t: livequery is the devil, don't use it

[08:53:02] <kborchers> ahhhh
[08:53:19] <Robbington> Anyone here any good with cloning events?
[08:53:39] <djQuery> gnarf: why not add a reference to your newContent in there as well?
[08:53:53] <mgoeppner> Robbington: am I having dejavu or did you ask that earlier?
[08:54:02] <Robbington> Asked a few times.
[08:54:07] <Robbington> Not sorted it out yet
[08:54:08] <mgoeppner> ah
[08:54:14] <xec> ?ask @ Robbington
[08:54:14] <bot-t> Robbington, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:54:24] <Robbington> Just looking for someone who can tell me where I am going wrong
[08:54:31] <mgoeppner> got it on a fiddle?
[08:55:19] <Sugitime> I have a div. Upon load of the page I hide it. When a select object is changed to yes, I show the div. When the select object is changed to No, I hide the div again. The div hides on page load, and changes to visible upon selecting Yes, however when I select No again, it does not hide. Here is my JS/JQuery: http://pastebin.com/0uwiLHyr

[08:55:39] <eddiemonge> ?livequery
[08:55:39] <bot-t> livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation

[08:56:02] <Eviltwin> Robbington: .clone does a deep copy
[08:56:24] <Eviltwin> There's no need to clone the children individually there
[08:56:38] <eddiemonge> Sugitime: thats another reason to use ===
[08:56:48] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: Eh
[08:56:51] <Robbington> Just trying a few things, either way it isnt cloning the event bound to it by another plug in
[08:57:15] <eddiemonge> Sugitime: thats a lot of wasted code
[08:57:38] <Eviltwin> Robbington: You know what .clone() does, right?
[08:57:47] <Eviltwin> 'Cause there's *A LOT* of clones here
[08:57:59] <Robbington> In short, there is a plug in that generates the li items in the first place and gives them click event that swaps the main image on the page.
[08:58:00] <khmer> <.<
[08:58:10] <khmer> the turtle is on its back, its belly baking in the sun
[08:58:36] <Robbington> I guess I do not understand clone propelry as I cant get it to work,
[08:58:39] <Eviltwin> The falcon cannot hear the falconer
[08:58:42] <xec> Robbington: i'm not sure what you mean by "clone an event" but maybe you could use .on() to bind rather than .click()
[08:58:59] <mgoeppner> Sugitime: what are you trying to do with that? jQuery has a toggle function
[08:59:12] <Robbington> Xec, I mean that the el has and event attached to it and I would like to clone it.
[08:59:24] <Eviltwin> xec: He's trying to copy event listeners bound to the original elements
[08:59:32] <Eviltwin> xec: And that's what .clone(true,true) does
[08:59:38] <xec> aha
[08:59:50] <mgoeppner> and you are assigning your div.visibility, not comparing.
[08:59:57] <Eviltwin> mgoeppner: He figured that out
[09:00:17] <eddiemonge> ?toggle @ Sugitime
[09:00:18] <bot-t> Sugitime, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/

[09:00:48] <kborchers> ?p @ [knight01]

[09:00:49] <Robbington> because it isnt cloning the event, at best I can get it to clone once

[09:01:15] <eddiemonge> oi
[09:01:22] <eddiemonge> bot-t has been cleaned out
[09:01:29] <kborchers> eddiemonge: lol
[09:01:36] <Eviltwin> Robbington: Well I'm still not really sure what you're trying to do
[09:01:55] <Eviltwin> But in line 7 you're binding to the thing you just cloned, not the clone you just made
[09:02:09] <Eviltwin> Which seems strange to me
[09:02:56] <Robbington> Got 4 li(each with a thumbnail), each with the bound click event that when clicked transfers the thumbnail src to the main image, I want to turn the 4 li into a scroller by removing the top li, cloning it and appending it to the bottom of the ul
[09:03:29] <Robbington> But when I clone it, the click event is lost, so the main image no longer changes
[09:04:07] <eddiemonge> Robbington: why not just move it instead of cloning it?
[09:04:13] <kborchers> Robbington: no need to clone, you can just use append and it will move it
[09:04:22] <Eviltwin> Robbington: I'm sorry, maybe it's my fault, but I'm having trouble following
[09:04:30] <eddiemonge> li.first().insertAfter( li.last() )?
[09:04:37] <Eviltwin> But looks like they got you covered
[09:04:48] <MoTiOnXml> is there a shorthand syntax for getting the DOM object for a jQuery object with a single item?
[09:05:01] <MoTiOnXml> or is get(0) always what i want?
[09:05:05] <Robbington> I'll give it a crack.
[09:05:08] <eddiemonge> Robbington: by the way, to clone with events, you use deep clone: .clone( true, true)
[09:05:17] <mgoeppner> MoTiOnXml: you mean :first?
[09:05:22] <eddiemonge> MoTiOnXml: $(ele)[0]
[09:05:26] <djQuery> Robbington: or see .on
[09:05:39] <MoTiOnXml> eddiemonge: \o thanks
[09:05:43] <eddiemonge> djQuery: why?
[09:06:11] <cj101> hi
[09:06:11] <mgoeppner> $("elem:first")
[09:06:47] <MoTiOnXml> should be faster than $("elem").first() right?
[09:07:21] <eddiemonge> mgoeppner: no, you shouldnt use that. .first() is better/faster
[09:07:24] <kborchers> i agree with djQuery. why not use .on for the click binding then as long as the moved element is still inside the element that the events are being delegated to, no need to deep clone
[09:07:52] <kswedberg> lodott, gnarf: I updated http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/ Hope that helps.
[09:07:53] <mgoeppner> eddiemonge: yeah i just pulled up the api and am reading more into it
[09:08:14] <Robbington> Christ... After all that, .first() works straight away. What a plum I am.
[09:08:21] <eddiemonge> kborchers: but if you move it, no need for delegation
[09:08:46] <eddiemonge> kswedberg: it does. it always does.
[09:09:05] <lodott> kswedberg: yes, at least in my problem today that would have helped, so it can't be bad. And yay, I am famous now :)
[09:09:12] <kswedberg> eddiemonge: I appreciate the support
[09:09:12] <xro> Hi, i try to use jquery with ajax... it nearly works but i dont get the answer... i see that jquery request the data but there is no alert? why --> http://dpaste.com/664431/ some help would be great...
[09:09:20] <kborchers> eddiemonge: true. i guess it would only be needed if at some point he wants to add to his scroller
[09:09:30] <kswedberg> lodott: congratulations!
[09:09:38] <kswedberg> :)
[09:09:53] <cj101> im having a little problem with jquery ui droppable. hoverClass doesnt seem to be working ive tried in jquery ui version 1.8.16 and 1.8.16 using jquery version 1.4.4. does anyone have any ideas as to why this would not be working? -> jQuery("#folder_name_" + id).droppable({ hoverClass: "folderNameSelected", drop: function(event, ui) { alert("Dropped onto name"); }});
[09:10:14] <cj101> where id is being passed into id and is an int
[09:11:09] <eddiemonge> kswedberg: no, i appreciate all your hard work, as does everyone here. amirite people?!
[09:11:52] <mgoeppner> eddiemonge: yeah your right :P
[09:11:54] <krogant> if i do var foo = somearray; does it make a reference to the array?
[09:12:02] <Eviltwin> krogant: Yes
[09:12:18] <krogant> which would explain my error - thanks Eviltwin!
[09:12:25] <krogant> is there some way i can clone it?
[09:12:27] <Robbington> thank you very much for your help, in 5 mins have sorted out what I have been scratching my head about for hours. I suck
[09:12:31] <eddiemonge> cj101: does that element exist? if you do console.log(jQuery("#folder_name_" + id).length) what do you get?
[09:12:33] <Eviltwin> krogant: .slice(0)
[09:12:42] <krogant> ahh, that seems hacky!
[09:13:01] <Eviltwin> It's not!
[09:13:23] <krogant> mhh, i'm still getting the same error
[09:13:40] <xro> nobody?
[09:13:53] <eddiemonge> krogant: what error?
[09:13:57] <eddiemonge> xro: somebody?
[09:14:06] <cj101> eddiemonge, i get 1 for each in the loop
[09:14:35] <krogant> interesting, if i alert out the values, they're different, so the error is elsewhere! thanks
[09:14:41] <xro> eddiemonge, could help me?
[09:15:01] <eddiemonge> is your response failing?
[09:15:08] <eddiemonge> what version of jq are you using?
[09:15:26] <eddiemonge> cj101: loop? paste your code see ? p
[09:15:26] <bot-t> cj101, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:16:02] <Eviltwin> xro: I suggest you use $.get("{%url get_diff_code%}",{url:url,date_ref:date_ref,date_cmp:date_cmp},function(data){...
[09:16:06] <Eviltwin> instead
[09:16:11] <Eviltwin> So that it takes care of the escaping for you
[09:16:41] <cj101> its a php loop getting info and writing js to the page, the problem is with that droppable bit, the draggable bit works ok, as does all the rest of the object
[09:16:49] <Eviltwin> xro: As it is, you aren't escaping
[09:17:04] <Eviltwin> xro: Which means those three things have a very limited valid characterset
[09:17:44] <xro> Eviltwin, i agree for the escaping... but why i never get anything in the data?
[09:18:10] <Eviltwin> xro: Probably because you're sending a mangled request so it fails
[09:18:12] <xro> Eviltwin, i know it call my view and my view return a HttpResponse
[09:18:19] <krogant> ahh! silly mistake!
[09:18:32] <eddiemonge> cj101: you cant upgrade to the latest?
[09:18:44] <xro> Eviltwin, it does not fail...
[09:18:59] <Eviltwin> Oh, well if you say so
[09:19:37] <eddiemonge> xro: what is the response? specifically the response code?
[09:19:53] <eddiemonge> xro: and what type of data is being returned?
[09:20:24] <xec> xro: when is show_s() called?
[09:22:10] <xec> xro: obviously it is getting called, if you're seeing the xhr request, i'm just saying the code snippet seems to be lacking, unless i'm going blind
[09:22:34] <cj101> eddiemonge, i dont want to unless i really have to as i dont want other parts of the site to break
[09:23:11] <cj101> eddiemonge,  or did you mean upgrading to the latest of jquery ui?
[09:23:27] <xro> xec, eddiemonge, i get a problem in my view... that cause an error... i'll fix it... i think my jquery should work after that... thanks... Hard to learn new language...
[09:30:34] <xro> i'm maybe stupid... but i not able to find a way to display the content of a jquery var in the HTML...
[09:30:56] <andrew9183> xro: use console.log
[09:31:11] <andrew9183> or console.dir
[09:32:13] <xro> andrew9183, console.dir to display the content of a jquery var in <html> <body> <div> <pre> THE PLACE TO DISPLAY </pre> ...  are you sure?
[09:33:57] <xec> xro: $('pre').html(var) ?
[09:34:49] <cj101> ok ive upgraded to the latest versions of jquery and jquery ui and its still not doing the hoverClass for droppable. any ideas?
[09:34:49] <xec> xro: of course, i would give the <pre> an ID and select on that, so you don't overwrite all <pre> elements on the page ;)
[09:34:51] <ericandrewlewis> i have an ajax method that for some reason is never calling the success function.
[09:35:02] <ericandrewlewis> wondering if this is because perhaps i'm running locally...?
[09:35:30] <krogant> is there an easier way to create the tr;s and td's for a table than this: http://pastebin.com/DfPzmQaS
[09:35:39] <xec> ericandrewlewis: by locally, you mean a static html file or a local webserver
[09:35:48] <ericandrewlewis> local webserver
[09:35:54] <xec> should be fine
[09:35:57] <xro> xec, yes... jquery doc is obscur for the noob... i read it and think i cannot use .html because there is no argument...
[09:37:06] <xec> xro: no argument gets current content, while htmlString argument sets, the doc says so quite clearly if you look a bit closer http://api.jquery.com/html/

[09:50:50] <Eviltwin> notjrbauer: I think the best thing you could do is delegate on A tags
[09:50:54] <Guest72393> Eviltwin: if you look at the page from Firefox and hover over the navigation, you will see the drop down load left and then jump into its correct position. Alternatively, look at it through google chrome and notice no issues with it.
[09:51:19] <Eviltwin> notjrbauer: $(document).on("click","a",function(e){/* A link was clicked */})
[09:51:34] <Eviltwin> notjrbauer: In there you can set the window.location
[09:51:37] <notjrbauer> i want to get that window.location inside their click though
[09:51:46] <Eviltwin> I think you can look at this.href
[09:51:52] <Eviltwin> And it should be the new window.location
[09:52:03] <notjrbauer> ex: their path is /, i want to change to /products/url
[09:52:12] <notjrbauer> kk ill try it out
[09:52:53] <notjrbauer> ahh sorry, they have a script that sets the window.location
[09:53:02] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ Guest72393
[09:53:03] <bot-t> Guest72393, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[09:53:21] <Guest72393> What is jdb? @ Eviltwin
[09:53:23] <Eviltwin> notjrbauer: Oh, I don't think you can catch that
[09:53:26] <mgoeppner> notjrbauer: would make more sense to do that on your serverside
[09:53:32] <Eviltwin> Guest72393: It's a trigger for the bot
[09:53:40] <Eviltwin> So I don't have to type that
[09:53:48] <notjrbauer> it's for a client
[09:53:49] <Eviltwin> Can you at least point me to the relevant file?
[09:54:06] <mgoeppner> mod_rewrite can make urls look however you want them to.
[09:54:20] <Guest72393> Eviltwin: if you look at the page from Firefox and hover over the navigation, you will see the drop down load left and then jump into its correct position. Alternatively, look at it through google chrome and notice no issues with it.
[09:54:22] <NoiseEee> notjrbauer: kinda screaming 'clickjacking'
[09:54:36] <notjrbauer> nah it's a client's site, we're making it mobile
[09:54:56] <Guest72393> bot-t: okay, I will do that, thanks.
[09:54:56] <bot-t> Guest72393, .bind() - Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[09:56:09] <mgoeppner> notjrbauer: again, mod_rewrite will work far better
[09:57:05] <Eviltwin> Guest72393: Also using inline things like <div onmouseover="..."> is considered a bad practice
[09:57:12] <notjrbauer> im just looking for scripting solutions, or I can just preg-replace (last resort)
[09:57:12] <Eviltwin> As is doing things like document.onclick =
[09:57:39] <Eviltwin> You should see ?.bind for the right way to do these things
[09:57:40] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[09:57:59] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: just wondering why you'd recommend bind vs on
[09:58:20] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: 'Cause he has jQuery 1.3.2
[09:58:38] <Eviltwin> And .on is only 1.7+
[10:02:05] <NoiseEee> and whats the general attitude toward old versions?
[10:02:18] <NoiseEee> not 'hey, upgrade'?  how far back do you help trouble shoot?
[10:02:35] <snover> not that far :]
[10:05:47] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/GNXxQ/6/ Why can't I select the iframe in this?
[10:06:02] <innociv> In the tinymce editor window, i mean
[10:09:01] <Jinxed-> anyone here use highcharts before and know how to set the units for gridlines?
[10:14:23] <ndk> holy cow!
[10:14:30] <ndk> thanx jquery!
[10:14:47] <Eviltwin> You're welcome!
[10:15:22] <ndk> making life easy for 3+ years, and profitable and timely fashioned too
[10:16:18] <ndk> however I should debug the latest version for Drupal 7, there are a few bugs that I had to resolve manually
[10:18:37] <ndk> saaaay, is that jsfiddle what I think it is?!
[10:19:21] <ndk> just throw in bunch of say jquery tools + sliders and some css to debug?
[10:28:29] <engaged> I have a <input type="checkbox" id="rush" amount="4.00"> and i check to see if it gets checked then i do var base = 4.95; var rush = $("#rush").attr("amount"); var total = base+rush; but total then is 4.954.00   - how come it isn't adding them?
[10:29:52] <Eviltwin> engaged: It's concatenating them because they are strings
[10:29:59] <gloone> is there anyway to get .map to work with IE below 9?
[10:30:04] <Eviltwin> Use parseInt(base)+parseInt(rush)
[10:30:05] <engaged> i tried parseFloat() but it did weird stuff adding them
[10:30:10] <Eviltwin> gloone: Uh...what?
[10:30:10] <engaged> they ar flaots
[10:30:11] <engaged> not ints
[10:30:15] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I lied, parseFloat
[10:30:16] <ivmx> hi, have a great day guys :)
[10:30:22] <Eviltwin> parseFloat both of them before adding
[10:30:31] <gloone> Eviltwin: .map refuse to work with IE
[10:30:33] <engaged> litotal = base + parseFloat(rush)  if rush is 9.95 it spat out like 13.9888888
[10:30:35] <engaged> something weird
[10:31:13] <dgx> Hey all I have a function to increment a vote field in the DB. Everything is working, even in IE8, but IE9 allows to endless voting. Ideas?
[10:31:14] <Eviltwin> gloone: Pretty sure it works just fine
[10:31:23] <Eviltwin> gloone: You're likely doing something wrong inside it
[10:31:23] <dgx> I have done with with .ajax..
[10:31:27] <gloone> i get an empty array back
[10:31:46] <Eviltwin> Are you returning from inside the map?
[10:32:02] <Eviltwin> And what are you mapping in the first place?
[10:32:07] <mgoeppner> So I have a question about the expected behavior of .text() on nested elements. When you call if on the parent, it returns all the text of child elements as well see: http://jsfiddle.net/vtu2q/ -- is this right or is it a bug?
[10:32:15] <mgoeppner> it*
[10:32:20] <gloone> it's not my code but i'm trying to find out why it's not working
[10:32:21] <gloone> http://pastebin.com/ntREg10e
[10:32:22] <gloone> there
[10:32:23] <Eviltwin> mgoeppner: ...it's not a bug
[10:32:26] <gloone> works fine in every other browser
[10:32:33] <gloone> i get a empty array in IE
[10:32:57] <Eviltwin> gloone: alert(jQuery('#material:checked').length) right before that
[10:33:12] <Eviltwin> Also, what the hell?
[10:33:12] <mgoeppner> Eviltwin: that answers my question then. ty
[10:33:35] <Eviltwin> Looking up by ID returns either 0 or 1
[10:33:37] <Eviltwin> elements
[10:33:53] <Eviltwin> So jQuery('#material:checked').val()
[10:33:59] <gloone> gives me a 0 in every browser, including IE
[10:34:38] <ProLoser|Work> what should i use for rendering pie charts and graphs?
[10:34:45] <smplstk> mgoeppner: that's the expected functionality
[10:35:06] <ibike365> @ProLoser - you could check out Kendo UI for that
[10:35:49] <Eviltwin> gloone: Then the array *SHOULD* be empty
[10:36:56] <gloone> it works fine in everything but IE though :(
[10:37:20] <Gorkyman> hey guys... anyone here using jquery ui tabs with ajax ?
[10:37:39] <mgoeppner> smplstk: I thought so but the api didn't mention anything about nested stuff, so i figured it couldnt hurt to ask
[10:38:07] <ibike365> @Gorkyman can you be more specific?
[10:38:09] <Rixy> hi, can sb help me how can I read a specified line from a text file and display it in the html page(for example 65th line from info.txt)
[10:38:27] <snover> gloone: :checked is a css3 selector that is not available in IE
[10:38:28] <ProLoser|Work> ibike365: is kendo jquery?
[10:38:41] <gloone> hmm, in chrome i get  [koncept] => Array ( [0] => jackor ) and in IE [koncept] => Array        (            [0] =>         )
[10:38:46] <ibike365> @ProLoser yes, it's a UI framework for jQuery
[10:38:52] <Gorkyman> ibike365: well, I'm returning a json data with a response... dont know how to populate the tab content then
[10:39:05] <Gorkyman> because as far as I understand, tab is auto populated with tabs()
[10:39:12] <Gorkyman> dont know how I can do it manually ?
[10:39:31] <gloone> snover: so what should i use instead? if(':checked')?
[10:39:34] <gloone> is even
[10:40:15] <Gorkyman> ibike365: so question is, how to manipulate returned data with tabs() ajax return
[10:40:17] <ProLoser|Work> ibike365: considering jqui does most of this and there is nothing about pie charts, seems a bit unnecessary
[10:40:19] <snover> actually that selector might be OK, now that I think about it.
[10:40:25] <snover> because it is standardised
[10:40:45] <ibike365> @ProLoser http://www.kendoui.com/dataviz.aspx
[10:41:02] <Eviltwin> gloone: Why are you using map *all* over the place?
[10:41:13] <Eviltwin> For single elements
[10:41:29] <Eviltwin> var kon = jQuery('#kon:checked').val() || ""
[10:41:31] <Gorkyman> hm, I guess dataFilter might work
[10:41:39] <gloone> they all have multiple check boxes, Eviltwin
[10:41:41] <djQuery> grrrr I hate php
[10:42:05] <gloone> snover:  http://pastebin.com/SKwbS3zQ <- the code
[10:42:34] <snover> gloone: my suggestion would be to stop using .val() and just access n.value
[10:42:39] <shodan45> why is "element" in $('.foo').each(function( index, element ) {}) not jquery-ified?
[10:42:39] <snover> you know it is a checkbox
[10:42:45] <ibike365> @Gorkyman, I am still not clear what the issue is. You can popluate the tab's data anyway you like. Do you have any example what you mean?
[10:42:50] <snover> so don’t load your code up with jquery overhead
[10:43:36] <gloone> snover: how exactly? i'm pretty new to jquery
[10:43:50] <snover> what do you mean how? you just do exactly what I just said
[10:43:58] <snover> instead of jQuery(n).val()
[10:44:02] <snover> use n.value
[10:44:07] <ibike365> @shodan45 you mean like element.val()?
[10:44:14] <Eviltwin> Seriously?
[10:44:17] <Eviltwin> Why are there maps involved?
[10:46:36] <gloone> snover: yeah, sorry, i'm a bit tired.. that does however not solve the IE problem. :(
[10:46:49] <snover> then something is wrong with your dom elements.
[10:48:32] <gho5t> If I want to replace an element's content with another's and keep the attached event handlers, is this the proper way: $('#someElement').html().append($('#someOtherElement').copy(true, true)); ?
[10:49:02] <Rixy> hi can sb guide me how can i read a line from a txt file in the local filesystem and store it in an array?
[10:49:17] <gho5t> actually maybe I should use replaceWith() ?
[10:49:58] <shodan45> ibike365: yeah. element isn't a jquery object, just a regular dom element (afaict).
[10:50:25] <ibike365> @shodan45 so you just pass it to jquery $(element)
[10:50:40] <JohnnyDavidson> is it possible to find where 0, 0 relative to scrolling? Like if there were 200px hidden at the top of the screen because you scrolled down 200px, how would you find that number?
[10:50:58] <Eviltwin> gho5t: $("#target").empty().append($('#source'));
[10:50:59] <shodan45> ibike365: I know that. :) I'm asking *why* isn't it a jquery object.
[10:51:11] <Eviltwin> gho5t: Now #source is the only contents of #target
[10:51:19] <gho5t> Eviltwin: ok thank you
[10:51:20] <Eviltwin> Both have all their original events/data
[10:51:27] <Eviltwin> But #source has been moved, not copie
[10:51:29] <Eviltwin> copied*
[10:51:31] <Eviltwin> Is that what you're looking for?
[10:52:00] <ibike365> @shodan45 because it's a DOM element, not a jQuery object
[10:52:08] <gho5t> yes moved
[10:52:16] <gho5t> well no
[10:52:20] <gho5t> i want to copy the event handlers too
[10:52:38] <Eviltwin> The event handlers are associated with the element, not where it's located
[10:52:46] <Eviltwin> When you move an element, you take its event handlers and data along with it
[10:53:09] <Rixy> i guess no body can help me :(
[10:53:14] <gho5t> ok i currently am using .html() to do this
[10:53:22] <gho5t> will that not copy the event handlers?
[10:53:25] <gho5t> cause it doesn't seem to be
[10:54:13] <Eviltwin> Okay, so do you know the difference between DOM elements and HTML?
[10:55:09] <gho5t> yes
[10:55:19] <gho5t> not sure how jquery differentiates the 2
[10:55:30] <gho5t> html is just text?
[10:55:36] <Eviltwin> Yes
[10:55:41] <gho5t> ok cool. thanks
[10:55:57] <Eviltwin> So $("#element").html() converts it to an HTML string
[10:56:02] <ibike365> @Rixy have you tried using .get()?
[10:56:09] <Eviltwin> And an HTML string doesn't contain the event listeners etc
[10:56:38] <Eviltwin> And then you $("#target").html(...) that HTML string
[10:56:43] <Eviltwin> It parses it and creates new elements
[10:56:51] <bmsatierf> Is there a smarter way to do $(this).find(">:first-child").find(">:first-child").addClass('my-class'); ?
[10:57:07] <gho5t> ah gotcha. that is helpful to know
[10:57:15] <Eviltwin> bmsatierf: You know CSS selectors, rigt?
[10:57:26] <Eviltwin> gho5t: That's how JavaScript works too
[10:57:30] <bmsatierf> Elephant: yes
[10:57:38] <Eviltwin> bmsatierf: .find accepts a CSS selector
[10:57:52] <bmsatierf> Elephant: thank you mate
[10:58:39] <ibike365> Elephant you just responding privately?
[10:58:50] <Eviltwin> He meant me
[10:58:55] <ibike365> oh lol
[10:59:16] <ibike365> There is an Elephant connected too
[10:59:20] <shodan45> Rixy: you want to read from a local text file?
[10:59:22] <shodan45> doh
[10:59:26] <shodan45> oh well :/
[10:59:36] <ibike365> seconds too late :)
[11:00:11] <shodan45> hopefully he learns that you can't do that
[11:00:22] <shodan45> assuming he meant local=client side
[11:00:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:00:37] <ibike365> i guess so, i only half read his question
[11:00:51] <klovni> anybody know how to add link to jq library into ff's new scratchpad thing`?
[11:01:00] <ColKurtz> damn animations D: I should have just kept each pane as a separate discrete page and pass the quiz values with a php session
[11:06:49] <gho5t> Eviltwin: If i want to copy just the contents of the div  and not the div itself, would I use contents?
[11:07:06] <Eviltwin> gho5t: Copy?
[11:07:10] <Eviltwin> Or move?
[11:07:37] <gho5t> copy
[11:07:43] <gho5t> i am usling clone
[11:07:46] <gho5t> using
[11:07:46] <Eviltwin> .contents().clone(...)
[11:07:51] <gho5t> ok
[11:08:01] <ibike365> @klovin doesn't it just run in the context of the current tab?
[11:08:09] <BinaryKitten> .clone().contents()
[11:08:12] <gho5t> .children wouldn't work right
[11:09:03] <BinaryKitten> gho5t clone the parent item
[11:09:28] <BinaryKitten> since .clone() would clone the 1 item (and contents) then .contents would itemise
[11:09:28] <gho5t> which i didn't want
[11:09:30] <gho5t> BinaryKitten: I was trying that. It grabbed the parent item as well
[11:09:49] <ndk> say, if im to ask something, how move entire div1 to div2?
[11:09:53] <klovni> ibike365: it runs but i was thinking of being able to include some code automaticly, like libraries. So i can test it in any page
[11:10:15] <BinaryKitten> gho5t clone then get the contents of the clone
[11:10:19] <dabear> ?append @ ndk
[11:10:19] <bot-t> ndk, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:10:23] <BinaryKitten>  the otherway would clone each item
[11:10:32] <buzzlightyear> can anyone please help me with this Jquery select please…trying to get birthday value by selecting the parent <tr> record first…http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=1ZckyEAJ
[11:10:57] <ibike365> klovini: not sure about that. i haven't played with it. just did quick read about it when you asked
[11:11:21] <Eviltwin> buzzlightyear: What?
[11:11:29] <klovni> it allows me to normally include jquery but i'd like it to be there automaticly
[11:11:34] <gho5t> BinaryKitten: this seems to be working $('#dialog').empty().append($(this).siblings('.form-dialog').contents().clone())
[11:11:42] <dabear> buzzlightyear: #user_10 input[name="birthday"]
[11:11:43] <dabear> ?
[11:11:45] <gho5t> BinaryKitten: I want to copy the contents of .form-dialog
[11:11:53] <klovni> it's more of an ff issue, but there's nobody there
[11:11:53] <Eviltwin> You're cloning the contents of the siblings of a form?
[11:11:54] <BinaryKitten> it works yes but is slower and messier
[11:12:28] <BinaryKitten> especially as you are doing a siblings content as well
[11:12:34] <gho5t> ok so you're saying to do: $('#dialog').empty().append($(this).siblings('.form-dialog').clone.contents())
[11:12:36] <buzzlightyear> dabear: hmm, let me try
[11:12:44] <gho5t> Eviltwin: yes I am putting it in the dialog
[11:12:46] <BinaryKitten> less work gho5t yes
[11:12:55] <BinaryKitten> .clone().contents()
[11:12:57] <dabear> buzzlightyear: what prevented you from doing that selector your self?
[11:13:00] <gho5t> ok thanks
[11:13:21] <buzzlightyear> dabear: i tried using $(this).closest('tr') and then filtering down from there - doesn't that work?
[11:13:24] <Eviltwin> gho5t: siblings doesn't include teh element itself
[11:13:46] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin no but inserting the clone of the item would
[11:13:49] <buzzlightyear> dabear: it's triggered by an href tag click inside the <tr> elemenet
[11:13:50] <dabear> buzzlightyear: filter works on current elements, you want find(), see ?find
[11:13:52] <bot-t> buzzlightyear, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:14:44] <buzzlightyear> dabear: thanks, let me investigate
[11:15:42] <buzzlightyear> dabear: find worked! thanks bunches
[11:15:59] <neybar> does jquery have a equivalent for mootools function.pass()?  Basically it creates a closure around the function and returns that.
[11:16:03] <dabear> buzzlightyear: nice, but make sure to read the docs next time
[11:16:17] <dabear> ?proxy @  neybar
[11:16:17] <bot-t> neybar, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[11:16:28] <dabear> is that what you want?
[11:17:59] <neybar> not exactly, $().click(foo()); will fire foo() immediately.  I want it to be delayed until the click event actually happens
[11:18:11] <Narinik_> when i refrence something like $('#images'), is images the id or the class?
[11:18:15] <Ezek2k5> how u call a menu bar that will stay on top even if u scroll the page
[11:18:17] <BinaryKitten> neybar just pass the reference
[11:18:29] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).click(foo)
[11:18:38] <ibike365> Narinik_: it's the ID
[11:18:48] <ibike365> just like CSS
[11:18:56] <buzzlightyear> dabear: thanks, yeah i 've used the selector for other areas of the website and it worked fine…just failed when i tried for table rows…but yeah, i am still learning :-)
[11:19:01] <Narinik_> ah, im having some issues with event bubbling
[11:19:04] <Ezek2k5> dont know what terms to google for
[11:19:45] <dabear> neybar: then why not use $().click(foo)
[11:19:53] <Eviltwin> Narinik_: Is that what the kids are calling it these days?
[11:20:06] <ibike365> Ezek2k5: something like http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/menus.en.html ?
[11:20:36] <neybar> @dabear: yeah? that works.
[11:20:58] * BinaryKitten thinks she might be invisible :p
[11:20:59] <dabear> neybar: then what's the problem :P why do you need to wrap it
[11:21:02] <Narinik_> calling what?
[11:21:26] <neybar> BinaryKitten: sorry, I saw your answer too.
[11:21:46] <neybar> mostly, I got carried away with the parans, then was looking for a more complex solution :)
[11:22:36] <Narinik_> How would i get the ID of the button here? http://pastebin.com/xGx1K7FP
[11:23:02] <cori[s]> hey all...I'm probably doing something foolish, but while the documentation for templates suggests that arrays will work fine, when I try to pass in an array the return of my jQuery.tmpl call is empty, whereas if I format the same data as an object the jQuery.tmpl call returns filled. Am I doing something else wrong, or is this expected behavior?
[11:23:06] <Narinik_> oops, lost a line in there
[11:23:20] <Narinik_> var $tgt = $(event.target);
[11:24:23] <Eviltwin> No
[11:24:33] <Eviltwin> $(this).attr("id")
[11:25:03] <andrew9183> is there a better way to do this?  if im looping through an array and with .each() and the index is 0, how do i make it start at 1 ?
[11:25:06] <Jon47> cori[s].. didn't they drop .tmpl?
[11:25:31] <andrew9183> i know i can do something like each(function(i) { if i = 0, then c = i+1 } ) and use c, but is there a better way ?
[11:25:34] <ibike365> .each(i){ i++; }
[11:26:10] <gloone> i found out what's wrong
[11:26:26] <gloone> if i do a  jQuery('#material:checked') IE will only grab the first item
[11:26:40] <ibike365> err... each(function(i) { i++; })
[11:27:55] <cori[s]> Jon47 good point - we're on 1.6.2, and I just now see the template plugin being dropped in the docs - don't go there that often. Guess that answers my question sufficiently for now....
[11:27:56] <NoiseEee> s/IE/browsers
[11:27:58] <cori[s]> thanks!
[11:28:24] <dabear> gloone: that's the correct behavior
[11:28:47] <gloone> dabear: so what should i do if i want to get every checked input?
[11:28:48] <dabear> there can only be one or zero elements in the dom with the same id
[11:29:25] <Jon47> cori[s] there are lots of other good template libraries, mustache.js, handlebars etc etc etc
[11:29:25] <ibike365> @andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/8G3jk/2/ for example
[11:29:29] <Narinik_> Eviltwin: this doesnt give me an alert http://pastebin.com/tPqpcxmN
[11:29:30] <Elephant> ibike365: you okay?
[11:29:42] <NoiseEee> gloone: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:29:45] <ibike365> yep. why?
[11:29:48] <gloone> thanks
[11:30:26] <andrew9183> er, ibike365: is that for someone else ?
[11:30:30] <ibike365> no
[11:30:37] <andrew9183> its a rotating cube
[11:30:40] <ibike365> oh hmm
[11:30:46] <ibike365> hold on
[11:30:59] <andrew9183> k
[11:31:08] <andrew9183> actually i got it
[11:31:10] <andrew9183> i++ works
[11:31:11] <andrew9183> thanks
[11:31:57] <Narinik_> anyone know why this isnt working? my list is styled with css if that changes it -> http://pastebin.com/tPqpcxmN
[11:31:57] <ibike365> weird, it's not updating my fiddle
[11:32:20] <ibike365> but yeah, just increment i on the first iteration
[11:32:25] <cori[s]> Jon47 I'm sure we'll go that route - just a non-trivial change for a project that packages jQuery so we're stuck with $.tmpl for the time being. given that it's deprecated though, I'm not going to worry about whether or not the docs are correct and will just make it work.
[11:32:56] <Jon47> word, good luck
[11:33:04] <cori[s]> thanks!
[11:37:01] <gho5t> so when I clone my element it has a form with jquery-validate events attached to it, and I can see them in there, but they will no longer fire
[11:38:35] <gho5t> Eviltwin: so when I clone my element it has a form with jquery-validate events attached to it, and I can see them in there, but they will no longer fire
[11:43:12] <gho5t> BinaryKitten: you still around?
[11:44:06] <Ezek2k5> ibike365 yes ty
[11:44:11] <ibike365> @Narinik_: worked for me when I fixed the syntax error </br> should by <br />
[11:45:03] <gho5t> seems like the validate handlers are still only going to validate the form that I copied
[11:45:07] <gho5t> from
[11:47:51] <ryanneufeld> anyone else find it odd that Date.getMonth starts at 0?
[11:48:58] <mansoor-s> ryanneufeld, yah i know what you mean threw me off too
[11:49:21] <ryanneufeld> I was like "WTF.... october is the 10th month.... am I drunk?"
[11:49:24] <ryanneufeld> nope not drunk
[11:49:25] <ryanneufeld> this time
[11:50:40] * Narcissus kicks uwsgi
[11:52:18] <gho5t> when I clone(true) a form and submit it, the validation is still firing for the original form, not the newly cloned one. How do I fix that?
[11:53:38] <ryanneufeld> gho5t: you have to call the validate plugin on the new form
[11:54:06] <gho5t> yeah so i have to reinitialize it
[11:54:20] <ryanneufeld> yes, for each form
[11:57:04] <natrixnatrix89> hi guys.. I have the following problem.. if I bind $(window).bind(mousemove, function(e)...
[11:57:04] <natrixnatrix89> then it works perfectly fine on modern browsers.. But I can't bind mousemove to window on IE
[11:57:04] <natrixnatrix89> what would be the most appropriate alternative for this? binding it to html or body? or maybe there still is some way to bind it to the window or document?
[11:57:33] <gho5t> so there's no way to just switch the target?
[11:57:39] <gho5t> ryanneufeld: so there's no way to just switch the target?
[11:58:01] <ryanneufeld> gho5t: I dunno, depends on the validation plugin you're using
[11:58:07] <ryanneufeld> I'm guessing not though
[11:58:14] <gho5t> the standard bass assistance one
[11:58:17] <gho5t> yeah
[11:58:27] <gho5t> somethign is going along behind the scenes to init the validation
[11:58:30] <gho5t> asp.net mvc
[11:58:35] <gho5t> i can't find it to copy it
[11:59:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm not much help there dude
[11:59:35] <gho5t> or maybe i just need to destroy it first
[11:59:40] <gho5t> since it's point at the first form
[11:59:48] <ryanneufeld> why are you cloning the form?
[12:00:40] <natrixnatrix89> Is it possible to bind mousemove to document? and make it work on IE?
[12:00:59] <ryanneufeld> natrixnatrix89: see ?bind
[12:00:59] <bot-t> natrixnatrix89, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[12:01:03] <groundup_> I have a performance index from 0 to 100 that I would like to style with colors from red (0) to green (100). I don't know what search terms I should use to find something that would do that for me. Any help?
[12:02:25] <natrixnatrix89> ryanneufeld: that doesn't answer my question.. Because of course I can bind it.. and it works fine on modern browsers.. but I'm wondering why is there a problem on ie
[12:02:53] <ryanneufeld> ?g IE bind mousemove doesn't work
[12:02:54] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, jquery - Can anyone tell me why this mouse move doesn't work for ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6446985/can-anyone-tell-me-why-this-mouse-move-doesnt-work-for-the-right-hand-side
[12:03:06] <ryanneufeld> wow, google worked :)
[12:06:10] <gho5t_> how do you destroy a plugin? $('#myForm').validate('destroy') ??
[12:06:47] <Eviltwin> Generally
[12:07:09] <MoTiOnXml> is it just me or doesn't $.get() support an error function?
[12:07:19] <MoTiOnXml> ie. called when the request fails
[12:07:28] <Eviltwin> ?$.ajax @ MoTiOnXml
[12:07:29] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:07:37] <groundup_> I think I found one - xcolor, but the site doesn't seem to work.
[12:09:09] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: hm, thought i already checked that function - but thanks for the pointer
[12:09:25] <Eviltwin> $.get is a very limited version of $.ajax
[12:11:49] <MoTiOnXml> Eviltwin: yea, it's me half asleep
[12:16:33] <opius> hey guys, quick question which i can't find the answer for on google.. i have a few asp.net linkbuttons which i .fadeTo , can i make it fade only the background and not the text?
[12:16:52] <Eviltwin> opius: No
[12:16:57] <Eviltwin> Not realy
[12:17:06] <MoTiOnXml> opie_: would think you'd have to position them individually
[12:17:10] <Eviltwin> You might be able to .animate the background
[12:17:12] <MoTiOnXml> opius: two layers
[12:17:21] <Eviltwin> But you need the plugin for fading colors
[12:17:23] <opius> Eviltwin , so my best bet would be to have a div around the button?
[12:17:40] <Eviltwin> fadeTo works by changing the opacity
[12:17:50] <Eviltwin> If you change the opacity of a div that contains a button
[12:17:51] <MoTiOnXml> opius: or, position the button on top of another div
[12:17:53] <Eviltwin> The button's opacity changes too
[12:18:05] <MoTiOnXml> opius: such that the button is not part of the fragment you're animating
[12:18:43] <opius> MoTiOnXml , yeah. this is a bit tricky.. but i'll figure it out :)
[12:19:11] <opius> maybe .animate with color plugin :)
[12:19:16] <opius> i'll google that
[12:19:34] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery animate color plugin
[12:19:35] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Color animation jQuery plugin - http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[12:19:43] <openback> Is anyone using Jeditable and CakePHP for a page with multiple models on it? I'm hitting a slight issue because it requires the id of the element to be the model's id, but that could lead to conflicting id attributes in the HTML.
[12:20:08] <Eviltwin> opius: The last demo is pretty close to what you want except with backgroundColor instead
[12:23:41] <Raynos> Is anyone knowledgeable of the jQuery events system?
[12:23:52] <Eviltwin> Why?
[12:23:55] <Eviltwin> Also
[12:23:55] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[12:23:56] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:24:06] <mdevilz> Hi, I am trying to use the datepicker, however no matter what I do, the datepicker only modifies the 1st input field, and not the one that it is attached to. Is there any i should be doing: code http://jsfiddle.net/dMTRv/2/
[12:24:25] <Raynos> Oh ok
[12:24:34] <Raynos> Basically I want to write my own dom event emulation
[12:24:41] <Raynos> and Im stuck on a good way to clean up event handlers
[12:24:43] <Raynos> http://jsfiddle.net/7XsBP/
[12:24:49] <Raynos> The above illustrates my issue
[12:25:18] <Raynos> I need to add a temporary listener to IE8s attachEvent to plug it into my own event system
[12:25:24] <ajpiano> Raynos: you might want to ping DaveMethvin in #jquery-dev, he's the maven
[12:25:26] <Raynos> I belief jQuery does something similar
[12:25:44] <Raynos> I wanted to have someone point me to the source where it solves my problem ;)
[12:26:00] <Eviltwin> Raynos: So what's the issue?
[12:26:06] <Eviltwin> What's getIEHandler supposed to do?
[12:26:25] <Eviltwin> Raynos: ...I think you can find the source if you try hard enough
[12:27:13] <Raynos> Eviltwin: I tried put couldnt pin point the bit I was looking for :\ I mean I could spend a few hours trying to understand the jQuery event system
[12:27:26] <Raynos> but I thought asking would be easier
[12:28:26] <Eviltwin> The problem is I still don't understand your problem
[12:28:42] <Eviltwin> And jQuery's event system is built to be really robust and support things like delegate and whatenot
[12:28:44] <Raynos> Ah ok
[12:28:45] <Eviltwin> whatnot*
[12:28:59] <ajpiano> Raynos: i think you'd be better off in -dev for this particular question, we tend to clear a lot of low-level support through here and are much more focused on like, handling library uses and use cases
[12:29:00] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to build jQuery's event system, just use jQuery's event system
[12:29:14] <Raynos> well, basically I need to use IE8s attachEvent to hook into my own event system
[12:29:22] <Raynos> so that I can handle real user clicks, etc.
[12:29:25] <ajpiano> Raynos: we store all our events inside of the jQuery.data cache
[12:29:31] <Raynos> Now I want to undo that hook in removeEvent
[12:29:38] <ajpiano> so when we need to get the handler, we just pull it off the element data
[12:29:48] <ajpiano> Raynos: i think this is the line https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L206
[12:30:09] <ajpiano> where it "gets the handler"
[12:30:11] <Raynos> I think iit might be
[12:30:33] <Raynos> ill come back if I get stuck again >_<
[12:31:23] <Raynos> elemData is gotten based on elem
[12:31:33] <Raynos> How is elemData.handle bound to the event type?
[12:31:41] <Raynos> This might indeed be a question for jQuery-dev :)
[12:31:49] <Eviltwin> I should join #jquery-dev
[12:31:50] <ajpiano> ;)
[12:31:56] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: yeah you def should

[12:35:45] <Eviltwin> It's weird
[12:36:12] <Eviltwin> I'm helping people with JavaScript/jQuery intermixed with writing a MIPS program
[12:41:40] <mparodi> I'm using $.ajax to get something from the server. it returns a json string but Jquery is not running the success handler, instead it executes the error handler
[12:41:55] <mparodi> what am I missing?
[12:42:17] <Eviltwin> mparodi: Are you using Firebug of the WebKit Developer Tools?
[12:42:22] <mparodi> Firebug
[12:42:32] <mparodi> it's returning it well, but the other handler is executed, it's weird
[12:43:13] <mparodi> Eviltwin, any idea?
[12:43:24] <Eviltwin> What's the response code?
[12:43:34] <mparodi> 200
[12:43:52] <Eviltwin> So it's hitting the error handler?
[12:43:56] <mparodi> yes :S
[12:44:08] <Eviltwin> console.log the textStatus and errorThrown
[12:44:13] <mparodi> by the way, if I change the dataType in .ajax it executes the success handler
[12:44:21] <mparodi> ok, good idea
[12:44:26] <Eviltwin> So.......change the dataType?
[12:45:38] <mparodi> readyState 4
[12:45:38] <mparodi>  responseText    "\n{test:123}"
[12:45:38] <mparodi>  status 200
[12:45:38] <mparodi> 	     statusText  "OK"
[12:45:53] <mparodi> oh, maybe the \n is making problems
[12:46:02] <Eviltwin> It is
[12:46:09] <mparodi> I don't know even why it adds \n
[12:46:15] <Eviltwin> Don't paste more than a line or two here at a time
[12:46:30] <Eviltwin> Link to a pastebin or something
[12:47:51] <chrisvwebdev> hello all. has anyone had any issues with $.trim() in ie7?
[12:47:54] <mparodi> ok, now it doesn't have \n but the behavior is the same, Eviltwin

[12:59:37] <Mkop> futini: first of all, you shouldn't have multiple divs with the same id
[12:59:48] <Mkop> use class isntead of id
[12:59:52] <Mkop> second of all, see ?.on
[12:59:53] <bot-t> Mkop, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:00:09] <futini> Mkop, i see .on, but dont work for me :/
[13:00:59] <futini> weit, i update my code

[13:04:17] <futini> thanks!!
[13:04:22] <mparodi> what's the problem with window.JSON.parse("{test: 123}")?
[13:04:26] <mparodi> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}'
[13:04:29] <mparodi> it says
[13:04:34] <futini> you are awesome :D
[13:04:55] <Mkop> :-)
[13:05:23] <mparodi> ohh. I can't believe I need to use {"test": 123}!
[13:05:44] <mparodi> why is that? it's not necessary at all!
[13:09:18] <Mkop> mparodi: javascript is very lenient, what can I say? JSON adheres to the spec :-)
[13:09:44] <Mkop> (I mean the fact that var obj = {test:123} is lenient, you really should say var obj={'test':123}
[13:09:44] <mparodi> eval("{test: 123}") works
[13:10:00] <mparodi> I don't see why window.JSON.parse works in other way
[13:10:31] <Mkop> javascript evaluation is lenient. JSON.parse() is compliant with the JSON spec
[13:10:40] <mparodi> I see
[13:10:52] <Mkop> JSON.parse("var i = 2, j=3") will also fail
[13:10:59] <Mkop> you can eval that just fine

[14:25:44] <hadees> so how can I check that $ is in fact jQuery?
[14:26:39] <ngharo> $.jquery would exist
[14:26:44] <jayblanchard> hadees comment out the jQuery library - if the $ functions still work they're not jQuery
[14:26:59] <ngharo> $.fn.jquery i mean
[14:28:52] <hadees> ngharo: wouldn't that not work though if $ doesn't have fn?
[14:29:34] <hadees> so I couldn't really test $.fn.jquery != 'undefined' because if it isn't jquery $.fn wouldn't exist
[14:29:40] <richardr> I am building a jQuery plugin. It uses prototypical inheritance. I have a couple of methods like render, swap, append. By default, when you instantiate this object it will render. But I want the ability to be able to pass through event listeners and call things like .swap, and .append ... but due to scope, I can't call those functions. Any help would be highly appreciated cheers
[14:29:55] <ngharo> hadees: true dat. just check $.fn then
[14:36:04] <guy> layout.on('dblclick', 'div.header div.block' [..] VS $('div.body div.block', layout).on('dblclick'

[14:36:31] <guy> in terms of performance are they the same? is there any I should prefer?
[14:36:51] <Eviltwin> How many matches are there for that?
[14:36:52] <Eviltwin> Approximately
[14:37:03] <guy> 0 to 20
[14:38:16] * guy so annoying that jquery is not properly indexed by Google. When I type jquery +on, I expect to see docs for "on" event.
[14:38:19] <Eviltwin> For anything >= 3, the first syntax will be faster but comes with another feature
[14:38:40] <Eviltwin> guy: api.google.com/<any jQuery function name>
[14:38:41] <guy> Eviltwin: they stay live?
[14:38:42] <Eviltwin> Err
[14:38:44] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com/
[14:38:55] <Eviltwin> Yes, it's the new delegate syntax
[14:39:22] <guy> Got it. Though, then I am surprised its faster then the second one (>=3). Why is that?
[14:39:51] <Eviltwin> There's one layout element, right?
[14:40:01] <guy> Yes.
[14:40:14] <Eviltwin> So the first case will bind one event listener on the layout
[14:40:30] <Eviltwin> When a dblclick event occurs anywhere inside the layout
[14:40:34] <Eviltwin> It bubbles up to the layout
[14:40:35] <guy> I see where you are heading.
[14:40:39] <Eviltwin> And the layout checks the target
[14:40:43] <Eviltwin> To see if it matches that selector
[14:41:07] <Eviltwin> In the second case it goes to each of those elements and binds a listener
[14:41:16] <Eviltwin> So potentially 20x the work
[14:41:44] <guy> Everything is so funny. I don't know why.
[14:42:09] <Eviltwin> The overhead of the delegate outweighs the benefits in performance for the super small cases
[14:42:12] <Eviltwin> i.e. 1 or 2
[14:43:55] <guy> Crystalised – The xx. What a good song. Eviltwin, I got it. I still don't understand what would be the difference if I'd need to write the two in plain JS, but that's probably because I am too tired.
[14:47:14] <Eviltwin> guy: The difference would be between looping over every div.body div.block in layout and binding an event listener
[14:47:31] <Eviltwin> And binding to the layout and inside there calling the function on each of the elements
[14:50:43] <guy> Eviltwin: In the latter scenario, if I have layout.on('click', 'div.foo', function(){}); JS will detect any 'click' event inside `layout` and every time check if it was `div.foo` element? rather than binding every div.foo element inside layout on page load.
[14:50:58] <guy> Correcy?
[14:51:03] <guy> correct*
[14:51:35] <andrew9183> i think its .bind('click'... no ?
[14:52:08] <guy> andrew9183: outdated. check documentation.
[14:52:22] <andrew9183> oh, how about .live ?
[14:52:22] <guy> since 1.7 if I am not mistaking.
[14:52:30] <guy> outdated. delegate as well.
[14:52:35] <guy> unbind as well.
[14:52:58] <andrew9183> ah i only use 1.6.4 atm
[14:53:11] <guy> any specific reason for that.. ?
[14:54:28] <diverdud`> if i have a google map, can i somehow draw a transparent circle on top of it?
[14:54:38] <andrew9183> no reason
[14:54:57] <guy> diverdud`: draw? can you use PNG instead?
[14:55:08] <diverdud`> guy: how so?
[14:55:39] <guy> simply positioning on top of google maps. Though, that's not a good option. Check Google Maps api. No need to be lazy.
[14:56:14] <diverdud`> guy: no thats a very bad solution
[14:56:32] <Eviltwin> guy: Correct
[14:56:44] <guy> diverdud`: haha. Well, that's why I told you to check Google maps API.
[14:56:58] <Zzaichik> no reason? did .live() work well across all browsers? Why would they kill it off if nothing was wrong with it?
[14:57:03] <brl0> is there a way to use delegate and filter in combination?
[14:57:45] <brl0> for example, delgate based on data- attributes instead of class
[14:58:11] <guy> Zzaichik: naming conventions, most likely. delegate/bind/live seems redundant to have 3 separate if one can do the same.
[14:58:42] <brl0> delegate is to a specific element, live is to the body iir
[14:58:44] <brl0> irrc
[14:59:09] <Zzaichik> so they kept delegate then? and got rid of .live and .bind / .unbind
[14:59:26] <brl0> maybe.. delegate is the newest of the bunch
[14:59:31] <guy> Zzaichik: api.jquery.com/on
[14:59:37] <brl0> i wouldn't be surprised if live has been refactored to use delegate
[14:59:46] <Zzaichik> sorry - I know I can go look. I just thought I'd ask instead.
[14:59:48] <Zzaichik> :)
[14:59:54] <Eviltwin> It always worked internally the same way as delegate
[14:59:55] <yan_nick> Hey guys, how can I define my javascript function which can I call like myFoo.next() ?
[15:00:00] <yan_nick> and myFoo.prev() ?
[15:00:12] <Eviltwin> But there were several problems with it
[15:00:23] <brl0> yep.. myFoo={next: function(){}}
[15:00:46] <Eviltwin> The biggest problem
[15:00:59] <Eviltwin> Is it hit what was really happening
[15:01:36] <Eviltwin> We've all used $("a") or something similar before
[15:01:41] <Eviltwin> And we know it builds a collection of those elements
[15:02:09] <Eviltwin> And we (hopefully) know that if we do var a = $("a"); $("body").append("<a/>");
[15:02:24] <Eviltwin> That our var a doesn't include that new A tag
[15:02:48] <brl0> put that in your pipe and smoke it
[15:02:51] <brl0> ;)
[15:03:04] <Zzaichik> I learned that the hard way
[15:03:28] <Eviltwin> So say we have $("a").bind("click",function(){...})
[15:03:30] <monstaRtruck> anyone work with mozila canvas?
[15:03:42] <yan_nick> brl0: var foo = {next: function() {}} ?
[15:03:46] <Eviltwin> We know that new A tags won't get that
[15:03:55] <Eviltwin> And we hopefully know that it's going to each of those elements
[15:04:03] <Eviltwin> And binding a listener
[15:04:13] <Eviltwin> To that element
[15:04:25] <brl0> yan_nick: yes, under that declaration you should be able to call foo.next()
[15:04:28] <Eviltwin> So now $("a").live("click",function(){...}) shows up
[15:04:40] <yan_nick> brl0: but i have to declare it as variable? var foo = ...
[15:04:41] <yan_nick> ?
[15:04:43] <Eviltwin> And somehow it applies to all A tags current and future
[15:04:58] <Zzaichik> you mean, .on() right?
[15:05:00] <brl0> oh..umm not necessarily - but it's a good idea
[15:05:10] <Zzaichik> that makes sense
[15:05:15] <Eviltwin> But it's extremely misleading
[15:05:15] <yan_nick> brl0: or just foo = {} ?
[15:05:23] <Zzaichik> yeah
[15:05:32] <Eviltwin> Because the click listener isn't being bound to the A tags
[15:05:37] <brl0> yan_nick:  var will declare the variable in the current scope
[15:05:41] <Eviltwin> It's being bound to the document
[15:05:46] <Eviltwin> And as events bubble up to the document
[15:05:51] <yan_nick> brl0: i need it in my whole page
[15:05:53] <Eviltwin> It checks if they match the selector
[15:05:57] <Eviltwin> And if they do, it calls the function
[15:06:08] <Zzaichik> ahhh, interesting.
[15:06:10] <Eviltwin> And what's worse
[15:06:13] <brl0> sure, as long as you're not defining it within a scope (function or other object) it will be available globally even if you use var
[15:06:19] <Eviltwin> Is say I have a page with 10,000 A tags on it
[15:06:28] <Eviltwin> And I do $("a").live(function(){...})
[15:06:38] <Eviltwin> jQuery goes ahead and builds a collection of those 10,000 A tags
[15:06:43] <Eviltwin> And then it binds to the document
[15:06:47] <Eviltwin> And then it throws away that collection
[15:06:54] <Eviltwin> It basically made that collection for nothing
[15:07:21] <Eviltwin> Which is why the delegate-style syntax is always better performance-wise
[15:07:34] <Eviltwin> $(document).delegate("a","click",function(){...})
[15:07:47] <Eviltwin> It produces the same result
[15:07:56] <Eviltwin> But instead of building a collection of all of those tags which goes to waste
[15:08:14] <Eviltwin> It builds a collection containing one element (the document) which is the thing it's actually binding listeners on in the first place
[15:08:17] <Eviltwin> And furthermore
[15:08:31] <Eviltwin> Maybe you're only intersted in the clicks in a particular DIV
[15:08:43] <Eviltwin> And they represent a tiny fraction of the total number of clicks on the page
[15:08:53] <Eviltwin> If you do $("#mydiv").delegate("a","click",function(){...})
[15:09:03] <Eviltwin> It only checks when the click originated somewhere in mydiv
[15:09:09] <Eviltwin> It doesn't have to check every time
[15:09:16] <Eviltwin> So you pick up performance there
[15:09:22] <brl0> ^^ do this
[15:09:28] <Eviltwin> But it got annoying to have three different functions for all of these
[15:09:38] <guy> Eviltwin: can you advice with the issue (, though it involved jquery-ui use). https://dev.anuary.com/a38ec092e41b78dddebdaaa4cbf11f1953a64676165304ff03f3c1b643e07e38/ Ignore the 1 & 2 blocks. DblClick "click this" element. Then try dragging red button inside newly created object. This will not work because jquery UI does not bind live events.
[15:09:39] <Eviltwin> bind, live, and delegate
[15:09:46] <Eviltwin> And then to have three different ways to undo those
[15:09:52] <Eviltwin> unbind, die, and undelegate
[15:09:53] <guy> Do I need to do $('div.body div.block', layout).sortable(); after every new element is created?
[15:10:01] <Eviltwin> guy: Yes
[15:10:10] <Eviltwin> guy: Or at least for the new elements
[15:10:21] <Zzaichik> so now you have simply on() off()  very nice, thanks Eviltwin
[15:10:22] <Eviltwin> So instead of all this mess with bind/live/delegate, they made one new hub for all of it
[15:10:25] <Eviltwin> Called .on
[15:10:33] <Eviltwin> With a very simple .off to undo any of them
[15:10:45] <Eviltwin> It supports the three different pieces of functionality
[15:10:46] <guy> oh. $(this).close().sortable() will work.
[15:11:00] <Eviltwin> And centralizes all of it
[15:11:06] <Eviltwin> And even makes it fewer characters to type
[15:11:22] <Eviltwin> And the old ones
[15:11:34] <Eviltwin> Actually call .on (or .off) with the right parameters
[15:11:40] <brl0> i'm trying to track clicks on a page and beacon the results to the server.. i'm thinking to do something like $('body').delegate('.beaconClass', 'click', function() {});
[15:11:53] <Eviltwin> brl0: Which version of jQuery?
[15:12:13] <graphics> http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/example.html  Is there any way to fade in and out of these example tabs?
[15:12:40] <brl0> but I'm not sure I like the class since the data I'm going to beacon is in a data attribute
[15:12:50] <Eviltwin> What?
[15:13:06] <Eviltwin> brl0: You have included something like jquery-*.js in your page
[15:13:12] <Eviltwin> For you, what's the *?
[15:13:18] <Zzaichik> Eviltwin: thank you, that was good. and good to know.
[15:13:40] <Eviltwin> Zzaichik: I've explained this like half a dozen times in the last two weeks
[15:13:49] <brl0> 1.6.2
[15:13:50] <Eviltwin> So I think I'm going to just write a post I can refer people to
[15:13:57] <Zzaichik> haha - getting it down to a science
[15:13:59] <Eviltwin> brl0: Then yes, use delegate
[15:14:07] <brl0> it's not a question about delegate :D
[15:14:19] <brl0> it's a question about delegating on a data-attribute selector
[15:14:25] <Eviltwin> brl0: If you were using 1.7+, it's better to use the .on
[15:14:36] <Eviltwin> brl0: You're selecting based on a clas....
[15:14:50] <brl0> 15:12 < brl0> but I'm not sure I like the class since the data I'm going to beacon is in a data attribute
[15:15:17] <Eviltwin> So wait
[15:15:19] <brl0> instead I would prefer to not use a class since I already have data-attributes
[15:15:23] <Eviltwin> The data you want to send is in data-
[15:15:27] <brl0> yes
[15:15:35] <Eviltwin> But you do (or can have) a class on all of them?
[15:15:43] <brl0> i can have a class
[15:15:48] <brl0> it already works with class
[15:15:58] <Eviltwin> It's significantly faster to match a class than a data attribute
[15:16:15] <brl0> yep, that's why I started the discussion..
[15:16:28] <brl0> say I have 50 elements or so that will beacon based on click
[15:16:43] <brl0> na, nevermind.. class it is :D
[15:16:45] <Eviltwin> How many clicks do you anticipate on the page?
[15:16:53] <Eviltwin> On the average visit
[15:17:08] <brl0> in the dozens.. nothing terrible
[15:17:13] <Eviltwin> And how many elements are on the page approximately?
[15:17:20] <Eviltwin> Order of magnitude
[15:17:32] <brl0> many
[15:17:40] <brl0> thousands
[15:17:40] <Eviltwin> Can you $("*").length?
[15:18:07] <ryanneufeld> ?wat
[15:18:07] <bot-t> Boom! Did you are unimpressed? and now? http://bit.ly/i2SDjX
[15:18:43] <brl0> 5K after a few clicks
[15:19:06] <Eviltwin> Okay, then delegating on a data attribute shouldn't be too bad
[15:19:34] <Eviltwin> Every click, effectively the $(event.target).parents() get .filter'd by the delegate selector
[15:19:48] <Eviltwin> (Parents and the event.target itself)
[15:20:09] <Eviltwin> So 12 clicks times the average height of the DOM tree
[15:20:10] <brl0> oh, that helps
[15:20:11] <brl0> thanks
[15:20:18] <Eviltwin> Is the number of things that are tested
[15:21:50] <Eviltwin> For a large number of clicks, $("#foo").click(function(){...}) would be a lot more efficient than $(document).delegate("#foo","click",function(){...})
[15:22:00] <Eviltwin> Even for maybe 3 elements
[15:28:24] <richardr> How do I pass custom event listeners (through say a callback) to a plugin, if these listeners are going to call plugin methods?
[15:28:36] <Eviltwin> ?
[15:29:11] <SmartTowel> is there a bug with hasClass() if an element has multiple classes (more than 2)
[15:29:28] <Eviltwin> SmartTowel: ...no?
[15:30:00] <SmartTowel> weird, i had an element with multiple classes and hasClass() was returning false when it was obvious that it did have the class.
[15:30:01] <Eviltwin> The reason there's addClass, removeClass, and hasClass is because the expectation is that you will have more than one class at some point on some element
[15:30:11] <Eviltwin> SmartTowel: Show
[15:30:21] <SmartTowel> indeed.  and the docs show the example with two classes.
[15:30:30] <Eviltwin> Show what you did
[15:30:46] <SmartTowel> let me get a fiddle going.
[15:30:49] <SmartTowel> one moment
[15:33:24] <graphics> Can someone help me fade in and out of some js tabs?
[15:33:44] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ graphics
[15:33:44] <bot-t> graphics, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[15:33:59] <Eviltwin> And see ?jdb
[15:34:00] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[15:35:48] <SmartTowel> @eviltwin, the other dev changed it from this: if ( jQuery(this).hasClass('delete') ) {...}
[15:36:15] <SmartTowel> to this:  jQuery(this).hasClass('delete') == 'delete'
[15:36:27] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: try ? cog
[15:36:29] <Eviltwin> Well that's not right
[15:36:34] <Eviltwin> ?cog
[15:36:34] <bot-t> Show us your code, or GTFO, we can't read your mind
[15:37:01] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin handy no?
[15:37:09] <guy> the correct method to access HTML data-[name] data is only using attr(), correct?
[15:37:21] <Eviltwin> Yeah but I'm tired of explaining how much code I would like to see
[15:37:26] <ryanneufeld> guy: wtf, no! see ?data
[15:37:27] <bot-t> guy, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:37:37] <Eviltwin> guy: .data("[name]")
[15:38:01] <guy> I thought data() stores data related with JS object internally in JS?
[15:38:16] <Eviltwin> Data is initialized with all of the HTML data attributes
[15:38:18] <guy> that's at least how I always used it..
[15:38:35] <ryanneufeld> guy did you read the docs?
[15:38:38] <Eviltwin> While it is used for more
[15:38:47] <guy> well, that's why its good asking sometimes even if you think you know it very well. : )
[15:38:50] <ryanneufeld> guy: or are you just assuming that you know better?
[15:38:59] <ryanneufeld> guy: it's VERY clear in the docs
[15:39:04] <Eviltwin> guy: Extremely clear
[15:39:12] <guy> ryanneufeld: several times, ryanneufeld. One time 3 years ago and maybe once again 2 years ago.
[15:39:51] <Eviltwin> guy: you need to reread "HTML 5 data- Attributes"
[15:39:54] <Eviltwin> On that page
[15:40:00] <ryanneufeld> guy: I have them open all the time, 2 years old docs for jquery is like using hyroglyphics for docs man..
[15:40:22] <ivmx> join #jquery-es
[15:40:27] <ivmx> lol
[15:40:32] <Eviltwin> There's a reason that we didn't refer you to a jQuery textbook
[15:40:36] <Eviltwin> We referred you to a website
[15:40:54] <Eviltwin> Websites are updated with new information
[15:41:32] <guy> that's cool.
[15:41:47] <guy> the data() being able to read html5 data- attributes, that is.
[15:41:49] <ryanneufeld> Step 1) Read the docs
[15:41:59] <ryanneufeld> Step 2) Read them again
[15:42:01] <guy> ryanneufeld: jajaj, go to sleep now. : )
[15:42:11] <ryanneufeld> Step 3) Try IT!
[15:42:15] <Eviltwin> SmartTowel: http://jsfiddle.net/74VMw/
[15:42:19] <ryanneufeld> Step 4) Ask for help :)
[15:42:23] <guy> ryanneufeld: and the humour goes like step 1) read the docs 2) get back to step 1
[15:42:24] <ryanneufeld> Step 5) ????
[15:42:35] <ryanneufeld> Step 6) Profit!!
[15:42:53] <ryanneufeld> ?docs
[15:42:57] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Main Page - There are a number of alternative resources for browsing the API. http://docs.jquery.com/
[15:43:28] <guy> Eviltwin: though, I don't understand your example.
[15:43:29] <guy> .data("[name]")
[15:43:42] <guy> oh, wait, wait..
[15:43:44] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:43:45] <ryanneufeld> guy: you asked how to access data-[name]
[15:43:49] <Eviltwin> Yes you dod
[15:43:50] <Eviltwin> did*
[15:43:58] <ryanneufeld> so how is it that hard to understand ?
[15:44:24] <guy> why did you put the brackets though?
[15:44:29] <Eviltwin> .........
[15:44:36] <Eviltwin> Because YOU did
[15:44:53] <SmartTowel> eviltwin, lol, you should of put 'delta bravo'
[15:44:58] <guy> and I would normally do data().[name]; yeah... but its different to put quotes in a quoted string and open sentence.
[15:45:24] <guy> brackets*
[15:45:27] <ryanneufeld> guy data().[name] will be an error
[15:45:34] <guy> data().name
[15:45:35] <guy> ..
[15:45:37] <Eviltwin> <div id="foo" data-type="hotel"> -> $("#foo").data("type") == "hotel"
[15:45:56] <Eviltwin> Or $("#foo").data().type == "hotel"
[15:46:07] <guy> that's what I've said (meant)
[15:46:50] <Eviltwin> The reason .data("key goes here") exists is because we don't want some asshole going in and storing all of their variables directly in .data()
[15:47:10] <Eviltwin> Like .data().counter = 12;
[15:47:21] <Eviltwin> Or whatever
[15:47:28] <Eviltwin> We like people to use namespaces
[15:47:51] <Eviltwin> Something like jQuery UI sortable stores its data as an object at .data("sortable")
[15:47:58] <Eviltwin> So as not to conflict with anything else
[15:53:57] <mweltin> I understand parseJSON but does jquey have the opposite function take a JS object and turn it into a json formatted string?
[15:54:55] <guy> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-connectToSortable option:connectToSortable "Note: Specifying this option as an array of selectors has been removed." so what should I do instead?
[15:55:08] <Eviltwin> mweltin: You want JSON.parse and JSON.stringify instead
[15:55:10] <bot-t> mweltin, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[15:55:30] <vacuoustruth> i'm using jquery UI menu with links inside each li. the links are unclickable (http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-menu-links-are-not-clickable) is there any way to un-preventdefault or can I not have links as menu items? thanks!
[15:55:37] <mweltin> Eviltwin, wonderful thanks
[15:55:53] <Eviltwin> guy: Thanks

[15:59:49] <Eviltwin> Use a selector string
[16:00:10] <mparodi> does anyone know any library to create a graph?
[16:00:29] <vacuoustruth> mparodi. d3.js is the best graph library.
[16:00:33] <tonyjcamp> mparodi check out highcharts
[16:00:34] <Eviltwin> mweltin: http://www.highcharts.com/ ?
[16:00:35] <guy> ++ d3.js
[16:00:39] <Eviltwin> Or d3
[16:01:02] <guy> oh. Highcharts are nice too. I use them in my server load dashboard. https://dev.anuary.com/dashboard/
[16:01:43] <mparodi> oh, wait a minute, I'm talking about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29
[16:01:58] <mparodi> vacuoustruth, tonyjcamp, guy, Eviltwin
[16:02:03] <guy> I am pretty sure d3 can help you, mparodi.
[16:02:09] <Eviltwin> mparodi: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/
[16:02:18] <Eviltwin> Look at the examples
[16:02:18] <mparodi> ok, I will check
[16:02:23] <mparodi> I don't think http://www.highcharts.com is for that
[16:03:04] <mparodi> http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html <-- O_O
[16:03:11] <mparodi> thank you! I think I will use it :)
[16:03:12] <tonyjcamp> mparodi: ahhh, I don't know anything that will create that. Are you mapping git commits or something?
[16:03:29] <mparodi> no, it's not the case
[16:03:32] <vacuoustruth> i'm using jquery UI menu with links inside each li. the links are unclickable (http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-menu-links-are-not-clickable) is there any way to un-preventdefault or can I not have links as menu items? thanks!
[16:04:57] <v0lksman> is there a better way to select the parent tr in this:  http://jsfiddle.net/kZ2Ak/
[16:05:15] <v0lksman> seems weird to call parent() twice
[16:05:28] <mparodi> I forgot to say I (actually the user) must be able to drag&drop the nodes and create new links. it seems d3 doesn't let you do that
[16:05:41] <guy> hm. lol? console.log( parent, items, parent == items );
[16:05:41] <guy> [div#items.ui-sortable] [div#items.ui-sortable] false
[16:05:53] <Eviltwin> v0lksman: .parent("tr")
[16:05:56] <Eviltwin> Err
[16:06:01] <Eviltwin> v0lksman: .closest("tr")
[16:06:07] <guy> does it compare hash (i.e. content as well of the object) or only if it is the same element?
[16:06:29] <mparodi> look, this is a good example http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaScriptDemo/Draganddropgraph.htm but it doesn't seems to be that good though :P
[16:06:34] <Eviltwin> guy: It compares the memory address the element is stored at
[16:06:36] <mparodi> do you know anything else like that? :)
[16:06:48] <guy> shouldn't it be the same then?
[16:07:00] <Eviltwin> Well
[16:07:03] <v0lksman> Eviltwin: nice!  thanks!
[16:07:03] <Eviltwin> What are parent and items?
[16:07:29] <Eviltwin> jQuery collections?
[16:07:29] <guy> the same. are supposedly the same elements, though, have different children.
[16:07:35] <guy> [div#items.ui-sortable] [div#items.ui-sortable]
[16:07:36] <Eviltwin> But they're not elements, right?
[16:07:40] <Eviltwin> They are jQuery collections
[16:07:41] <guy> They are.
[16:07:46] <Eviltwin> They are which
[16:08:26] <guy> I mean, one is $('#items') (the actual DOM element selected), and the other one is $(event.target.parent)
[16:08:38] <Eviltwin> So as I asked
[16:08:46] <Eviltwin> These are not elements
[16:08:49] <Eviltwin> They are jQuery collections
[16:09:12] <Eviltwin> No two separately created collections are == or ===
[16:09:28] <Eviltwin> For example $("#foo") == $("#foo") will be false
[16:09:39] <guy> Well, then the best way to check if it is the same object is to check $(event.target.parent) has id #items?
[16:10:05] <Eviltwin> $(event.target.parent).attr("id") === "items" or $(event.target.parent).is("#foo")
[16:10:33] * guy heading to api.jquery.com/is
[16:10:50] <Eviltwin> Good call
[16:11:37] <Eviltwin> .is("selector") is effectively .filter("selector").length > 0
[16:12:18] <Eviltwin> Or more generically .is(...) is effectively .filter(...).length > 0
[16:12:38] <guy> well, that's cool. https://dev.anuary.com/a38ec092e41b78dddebdaaa4cbf11f1953a64676165304ff03f3c1b643e07e38/
[16:12:51] <guy> It would have taken a lot of time to develop that using plain JS. just saved at least few days.
[16:13:44] <Eviltwin> Meh, it's just a question of arranging it correctly
[16:18:56] <ColKurtz> Anybody down to try and help me squash some bugs?
[16:19:04] <ColKurtz> so tired of this project all week --_--
[16:20:00] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ ColKurtz
[16:20:00] <bot-t> ColKurtz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:20:53] <ColKurtz> http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html i have 3 panes that the user goes through, in each one there's 3 buttons that initiate a function to show an animation. If one button (and its scene) are already active, and the user clicks another button, the first one should deactivate and the new one should be drawn
[16:21:36] <ColKurtz> I have destroy and create functions for each 'scene.' I tried creating a calllback so that if a scene was already present, first destroy it, then show the next one in the callback
[16:21:43] <ColKurtz> but it's not quite working
[16:22:43] <ColKurtz> I think it was working pretty well on a mac in safari. I'm using Firefox 8 on windows and experiencing bugs
[16:23:08] <ColKurtz> Here's the code: http://pastie.org/2952455
[16:23:17] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ ColKurtz
[16:23:17] <bot-t> ColKurtz, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[16:23:55] <Eviltwin> I'll take a look but I don't have time to make an effort to understand all of the flow
[16:24:18] <ColKurtz> line 257
[16:24:39] <Eviltwin> But for starters I would try running this in the Firebug console just to make sure it's not somehow catching Firefox 8: ($.browser.msie  && parseInt($.browser.version) == 8)
[16:24:58] <ColKurtz> or line 250 where it demarcates the section /* BUTTONS */
[16:25:17] <ColKurtz> that's where I'm trying to build the destroy/create components as a callback so they don't interfere with one another
[16:25:19] <Eviltwin> Oh my God
[16:25:22] <ColKurtz> because atm thats' the problem
[16:25:25] <Eviltwin> eval(destroy+'()');
[16:25:27] <Eviltwin> No
[16:25:32] <Eviltwin> Don't use eval
[16:25:42] <ColKurtz> I thought that wasn't much good
[16:26:00] <Eviltwin> Two solutions
[16:26:02] <ColKurtz> how would you suggest I point certain elements to the right functions?
[16:26:08] <Eviltwin> 1) Organize some of thse functions into objects
[16:26:29] <opius> Eviltwin, thanks btw. the .animate with color plugin worked perfectly
[16:26:39] <ColKurtz> Unfortunately my boss has been pressing me for a really terribly tight deadline and so this is all hacked together as quick as possible
[16:26:54] <ColKurtz> and i've never done something this complicated, only small flourishes on websites before
[16:28:13] <ColKurtz> and so it's all been fairly challenging and a bit beyond me...and at the same time they're screaming for time
[16:28:59] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: http://pastebin.com/e87R416f
[16:29:55] <vini22> same one can help-me JQUERY
[16:30:02] <vini22> I need help
[16:30:23] <vini22> pleasy
[16:30:23] <vini22> please
[16:31:20] <zeejy> Question on sortable: I have numerous divs that contain sortable lists that are connected. Each of these divs is set to overflow:auto. In addition, all of the divs are in a parent div that is also set to overflow:auto. The problem is that when dragging from one div to the other, it's not auto-scrolling the parent div because of relative positioning. Quick image to see what's happening:
[16:31:20] <zeejy> http://skitch.com/zkoch/gpn12/sortable-problem  Any thoughts on how to address?
[16:31:31] <zeejy> @vini22 What is your problem?
[16:31:42] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: The other upshot is you can do things like this: http://pastebin.com/S5GyBb8n
[16:31:48] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Within one of those objects
[16:31:56] <Eviltwin> And even put in other little helper functions etc
[16:32:05] <Eviltwin> It allows you to expose some of that stuff
[16:32:06] <vini22> I need access a function in Jquery with javascript, but I dont know how I do this
[16:32:21] <Eviltwin> So that if you find yourself saying "oh fuck, I really wish I could modify this variable the other function set"
[16:32:26] <zeejy> @vini22 What function do you need to access? What are you trying to accomplish?
[16:32:32] <Eviltwin> You can just to button.Spa.variable = ...;
[16:33:03] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Sorry, this: http://pastebin.com/L2FgH1JF
[16:34:18] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: This will also mean that instead of your line 264-267 eval stuff, you can do buttons[oneToDestroy].destroy()
[16:34:38] <Eviltwin> Or if you want to error check, if(buttons[oneToDestroy]) buttons[oneToDestroy].destroy()
[16:35:51] <zeejy> Anyone have any thoughts on the jQuery sortable issue? I'm a bit stumped on how to address...
[16:36:43] <Eviltwin> Another potential issue is that animations are asynchronous
[16:36:52] <ColKurtz> hm I think i tried that Eviltwin to call the function
[16:36:56] <ColKurtz> i'll give it another shot
[16:37:03] <ColKurtz> thanks for the help, really appreciate it
[16:37:10] <ColKurtz> just met with boss/coworkers again about it
[16:37:10] <Eviltwin> No problem
[16:37:22] * ColKurtz cracks open ANOTHER redbull
[16:37:41] <Eviltwin> What I described requires that you switch to a model like this: http://pastebin.com/S5GyBb8n
[16:37:53] <Eviltwin> Which is really a better way of doing it
[16:37:59] <Eviltwin> Since you can do things like this: http://pastebin.com/L2FgH1JF
[16:38:09] <Eviltwin> Have that object track some internal state
[16:38:14] <Eviltwin> Which will make it easier to teardown
[16:38:49] <ColKurtz> ah that looks so much nicer Eviltwin
[16:39:20] <Eviltwin> I don't think it'll take much time at all to switch
[16:39:25] <Eviltwin> It's better organization and more powerful
[16:40:03] <ColKurtz> now i tied each of the buttons to their corresponding functions by eval()ing their class values
[16:40:14] <Eviltwin> Yeah, don't
[16:40:38] <ColKurtz> how do I tie them to the correct object?
[16:41:14] <Eviltwin> Gimme a sec
[16:42:13] <ColKurtz> I mean I could do a click() for each button and have it execute a method of the object
[16:45:14] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Something like this: http://pastebin.com/c43Sj7B4
[16:45:29] <Eviltwin> You use .data() to associate the object with the element
[16:45:43] <Eviltwin> Then when you're looping over the elements, you can get the object
[16:45:57] <Eviltwin> Gotta go now, sorry
[16:46:07] <Eviltwin> But I think what I've sent you should help
[16:46:21] <Eviltwin> (It's not bug-checked but I think it's good)
[16:46:42] <Eviltwin> This version involves creating the elements on the fly but you don't have to do that
[16:46:48] <Eviltwin> Anyway, good luck, TTYL
[16:47:03] <ColKurtz> thanks eviltwin, appreciate the help
[16:47:16] <ColKurtz> :)
[16:47:53] <mweichert> hello, any jquery cycle users here?
[16:49:18] <ColKurtz> me
[16:50:16] <leo_> hi, i saw that in 1.7, .live() is deprecated, but .on() does'nt work when binding an element added after the loading
[16:51:00] <leo_> what should i use ?
[16:51:20] <ColKurtz> re-read on's documentation leo_
[16:51:29] <ColKurtz> on() is a combination of bind() and delegate()
[16:51:48] <ColKurtz> depending on how you write the syntax. In it's simpler form, it's just a normal bind
[16:51:51] <vini22> Please same one halp-me I whant Play the sound on JQUERY by JS, are source and demo here ==>  http://jsfiddle.net/vanazzi/vcKdF/2101/   <===
[16:52:08] <ColKurtz> If you need to have it work like live, you need to write out the syntax like delegate()
[16:52:33] <ColKurtz> vini22, use sound manager 2, makes it super easy.
[16:52:50] <leo_> ok thanks ColKurtz :)
[16:53:50] <vini22> This source is good for me, If I not found a solution here I will try the sound maneger 2 thanks colkurtz.
[16:56:01] <vini22> for me play this with JS need be easy, I don´t know jquery for me self make run with js. for this I need help  source and demo ==>  http://jsfiddle.net/vanazzi/vcKdF/2101/   <=== same one can help-me
[17:03:16] <vini22> Tanks for sound maneger 2 - That is excelent solution and not need Jquery.
[17:03:46] <vini22> Thanks Colkurts.
[17:08:47] <guy> how do I read key/value of object-array?
[17:08:48] <guy> [Object { error="This is error message."}, Object { success="This is success message."}]
[17:09:25] <Casey> How can I measure child elements and apply a class to whichever has the greatest height?
[17:12:24] <guy> Casey: just run through all elements and keep track of the last element with the biggest height; at the end the same variable will contain height of the biggest element.
[17:12:50] <Casey> guy: do you have a simple example?
[17:13:23] <guy> Its simple task. Use your brains.
[17:16:18] <imsky> lol
[17:16:18] <bot-t> (2 hours 51 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky WHY DID YOU LEAVE
[17:16:18] <bot-t> (2 hours 51 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky I was here the whole time, just afk
[17:16:31] <imsky> abjorn: i was backing up all my shit
[17:19:42] <thebignoise> i use unbind to remove click
[17:19:51] <thebignoise> but then use bind to put the click back but it doesn't work
[17:19:56] <thebignoise> is there some other way to do this?
[17:26:57] <ColKurtz> lol in the middle of converting the entire thing to an object, i thought maybe I should try using setTimeout() for my activate function, see if it will work without bugging out... works! I'll convert it all to a nice looking object when I have the time :)
[17:28:13] <ColKurtz> --__-- totally fails in IE
[17:28:14] <ColKurtz> 8
[17:30:35] <chovy> how do i check if an input is checked or not.
[17:31:01] <chovy> $("input[name=foo]").attr('checked') doesn't appear to work.
[17:31:45] <c_t_montgomery> chovy: $("input").is(":checked") should do the trick…\
[17:41:19] <Casey> Why does this change the style of the first p element: http://jsfiddle.net/Ux9X6/1/ ?
[17:52:59] <abjorn> IMSKY
[17:53:01] <abjorn> aw he left
[18:02:54] <imsky> writing some jaekwerys who's with me
[18:03:35] <coldhead> i'm lucky to get out of sea ess hess hell, buddy
[18:03:56] <imsky> i salute you, little bugger
[18:04:13] <coldhead> I'M BIGGER'N YOU
[18:04:22] <imsky> GET IN MA BELLEH
[18:04:38] * coldhead covers himself in vegetable oil
[18:04:51] <maushu> Is it possible to do a POST with query data (?stuff=123) with .ajax()?
[18:04:52] <imsky> hey he kinda looks like a little bebe
[18:06:41] <hadees> i need to rename $ and jQuery inside my actual jQuery file.  no conflict isn't going to work because I can't guarantee when it will be run.  What exactly do I have to change if I say want jQuery and $ to be foobar instead?
[18:06:50] <hadees> find and replace isn't really working
[18:07:32] <coldhead> maushu: yes, just put the query stuff in the URL you provide to ajax or post
[18:07:40] <coldhead> and give it the other data as post
[18:07:42] <maushu> Makes sense.
[18:08:05] <coldhead> it's better to avoid having to send both if you can
[18:08:08] <coldhead> but i know how it is
[18:08:58] <coldhead> hadees: noConflict is way preferable
[18:09:08] <coldhead> you don't want to have to search/replace everytime there's a new file
[18:09:29] <coldhead> can't you just write a lil noConflicter function and stick that at the end of your jQuery file and call it there?
[18:09:40] <hadees> coldhead: i know but i can't guarantee order of when things are going to be loaded
[18:09:45] <maushu> IE how I hate thee.
[18:09:55] <maushu> coldhead, blame IE.
[18:10:05] <coldhead> i understand hadees, but if you put it at the bottom of jQuery...
[18:10:13] <coldhead> you'll get it as soon as jQuery loads
[18:10:17] <hadees> coldhead: hmm I guess I could run no conflict inside the jquery.  How does that effect plugins? I have to use the fancy box plugin
[18:10:33] <coldhead> hadees: it doesn't effect good plugins at all
[18:10:49] <coldhead> shitter plugins you can fix by wrapping them in a function where jQuery and $ are the same thing
[18:10:52] <maushu> I have this perfect REST web service. IE doesn't like. So I'm adding hacky stuff to the query so that IE likes it without changing stuff for other browsers.
[18:10:56] <hadees> coldhead: i mean in general. how do i load my query plugin into my foobar namespace instead of the other one
[18:10:58] <coldhead> as on the Using JQuery with Other Libs page
[18:11:29] <coldhead> (function ($) {/* do plugin stuff here */})(jQuery)
[18:19:45] <hadees> coldhead: does no conflict fix what ever was written over?
[18:19:58] <coldhead> it sure does!
[18:20:04] <coldhead> it saves a copy of $ when jQuery starts
[18:20:13] <coldhead> and noConflict restores it
[18:20:21] <hadees> cool, so i really only have to do window.foobar = $.noConflict()
[18:20:25] <coldhead> they would have to call it someConflict() otherwise
[18:20:39] <coldhead> check the docs, noConflict can take params
[18:20:41] <coldhead> i forget what they do
[18:20:45] <coldhead> ?noconflict
[18:20:45] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[18:20:54] <coldhead> oh maybe you don't need that
[18:20:57] <coldhead> it's a matter for yourself
[18:30:37] <luite> is there a standard solution/plugin for this? I have a text field with a handler that gets called when the contents are changed, the handler does a http requests. now I want the handler to be called eventually if the input is changed, but not call it many times if the user quickly types some text into the field
[18:32:48] <Eviltwin> luite: http://jsfiddle.net/pP2Zn/1/
[18:36:56] <guy> I think I found bug in Jquery-UI
[18:37:10] <guy> try dragging any picture to the blue area
[18:37:11] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/a38ec092e41b78dddebdaaa4cbf11f1953a64676165304ff03f3c1b643e07e38/
[18:37:12] <luite> Eviltwin: thx, hmm, I hadn't thought of aborting older requests.
[18:37:24] <guy> and see the console. Its either bug or I cannot explain the behaviour.
[18:38:41] <guy> what I am doing? I don't want to allow person to drop the item if some conditions are not met. That's why I try calling sortable cancel in beforeStop
[18:39:21] <luite> Eviltwin: but I don't think this is ideal, it waits a second for the first req
[18:44:29] <Eviltwin> luite: then turn the delay down
[18:45:33] <guy> Eviltwin: can you advice on how to do what I want? say, event "over" is triggered: at this point if conditions are not met, I want to change placeholder class (to error) and if user still decides to drop the item, cancel the sortable.
[18:46:26] <Eviltwin> guy: Sortable is part of jQuery UI and I don't really work with jQuery UI
[18:46:32] <guy> Got it.
[18:49:02] <guy> The documentation kinda sucks..
[18:49:40] <Eviltwin> guy: If you're regularly working with jQuery UI, I suggest you read about and understand how the jQuery UI Widget API works
[18:50:00] <Eviltwin> Then actually read the source of the jQuery UI plugins you use regularly, they're mostly pretty small and light
[18:50:06] <guy> No, I don't. I've decided to experiment only for this project.
[18:51:45] <guy> uh. Though looking at source helped.
[19:17:07] <Guest18133> how do i change the z-index of the auto complete form?
[19:23:12] <sunscreen> hrm i am playing with drag and drop stuff and when i do  .. mydiv.insertBefore( dragged_audio_object, mydiv.firstChild ); .. the object is graphically corrupted
[19:23:26] <sunscreen> any one know whats occuring here?
[19:30:37] <jDiego> hello ppl
[19:35:06] <guy> I think it is pretty cool.
[19:35:08] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/a38ec092e41b78dddebdaaa4cbf11f1953a64676165304ff03f3c1b643e07e38/
[19:35:13] <guy> What do you think guys?
[19:37:14] <dr0id> what's cool about it ?
[19:38:03] <guy> Well, I never done anything like this /drag and drop interface/ so it is cool think to play with.
[19:39:21] <danhixon> Hi All, looking for some help. Probably missing something silly but let's say I have a jQuery object - how can I append to it's selector to get a subset? I've been looking for something like this but can't find it: selectorDefinedBySomethingElse.and('.selected')
[19:39:38] <danhixon> Or is there anyway to get the original selector value from a jQuery object?
[19:40:31] <guy> filter() ?
[19:44:50] <danzik17> danhixon: see ?andSelf
[19:44:51] <bot-t> danhixon, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[19:45:32] <danhixon> thanks guy - that is exactly what I was looking for
[19:46:08] <danhixon> bot-t, thanks - I saw that too… i don't know what it does but it doesn't do what i need :)
[19:46:09] * bot-t sighs
[19:47:34] <danhixon> I'm sure andSelf is great and I'll need it someday but I don't understand it tonight :) - filter is working like a charm
[19:49:27] <bonhoffer> what it the general strategy to have a datepicker that is not connected to a form element?
[19:49:58] <bonhoffer> i want to select multiple dates, and have that submit with a form. but don't want to have to click on a text-field tag
[19:51:15] <Eviltwin> bonhoffer: There's a .datepicker("show") or something
[19:51:29] <Eviltwin> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker#methods
[19:51:38] <bonhoffer> Eviltwin: but how do i get the data off of it?
[19:51:56] <bonhoffer> where does it store that data if not in a form element
[19:56:28] <kborchers> bonhoffer: i think you could just create the datepicker on a div which would create it staticly in the page and set its alternate field to a hidden field
[19:56:51] <bonhoffer> kborchers: so the alternate field is the key -- never seen that
[19:57:11] <bonhoffer> so most controls have an alternate field
[19:57:13] <bonhoffer> ?
[19:57:22] <kborchers> no
[19:57:24] <kborchers> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-altField
[19:58:19] <kborchers> guess that link doesn't exactly take you there but if you scroll down and click the options tab it is near the top of the list bonhoffer
[19:58:25] <Guest18133> how do i add an image to each result in autocomplte
[19:59:06] <bonhoffer> kborchers: thanks, i ask because i'm trying to work with this: http://dubrox.blogspot.com/2010/09/multiple-dates-picker-for-jquery-ui.html
[19:59:22] <bonhoffer> i want to read in a set of dates using json and have them highlighted
[19:59:25] <kborchers> Guest18133: use this as a guide. it should get you close http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[20:00:29] <kborchers> bonhoffer: you're on your own there. i have never used that ... it is not an official UI widget
[20:00:38] <bonhoffer> kborchers: so that looks like a datepicker wrapper, so all functions of datepicker should transfer
[20:00:39] <sunscreen> guy
[20:00:52] <sunscreen> just having my own problem with drag and drop funnily
[20:00:58] <bonhoffer> kborchers: is there an official widget which will allow for selecting multiple dates?
[20:01:05] <sunscreen> http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/DnD/ <-- check that one
[20:01:26] <kborchers> bonhoffer: nope
[20:01:32] <kborchers> just datepicker
[20:02:08] <bonhoffer> cool -- i'm glad i don't have to dig
[20:02:20] <kborchers> bonhoffer: you could always add it and send us a pull request ;)
[20:02:36] <bonhoffer> perhaps i will
[20:19:12] <guy> Good night.
[21:29:17] <sunscreen> awwwwww
[21:29:20] <sunscreen> #"@!$!@
[21:29:31] <sunscreen> jquery-file-upload wont integrate into my site for some reason
[21:30:45] <sunscreen> +-
[21:31:24] <sunscreen> must be some clash of css and js
[21:37:22] <thomedy> im trying to grab the html out of a div it is a child of a child of a child and my defining div is the grandparent so what i ahve done is grabed that grand parent and then chained it
[21:37:28] <thomedy> to .children('span')
[21:37:33] <thomedy> but im getting a null
[21:47:49] <^zoggy^> can anyone recommend a decent css based horz menu that can do multiple levels ?
[21:50:59] <littlebill902> i just don't get it... checked to see if jquery ui was loaded and it is yet none of the jquery UI stuff will work
[21:51:04] <littlebill902> if($.ui){
[21:51:04] <littlebill902>     window.alert(jQuery.ui.version)
[21:51:04] <littlebill902> }
[21:51:07] <littlebill902> shows i have it loaded
[21:51:11] <nowimproved1> ya zoggy ill suggest superfish menu
[21:51:20] <littlebill902> but i can't get a simple progressbar to show up
[21:51:58] <^zoggy^> i use superfish/suckerfish currently
[21:52:28] <Cork> littlebill902: have you tried using the example code on http://jqueryui.com/demos/progressbar/ ?
[21:52:35] <nowimproved1> right zoggy.. i use son of suckerfish css code and superfish jquery works nice i think
[21:52:58] <nowimproved1> along with hover intent
[21:53:10] <luite> what event do I need to bind if I want the handler to be run when the text in an autocomplete textfield changes?
[21:53:22] <littlebill902> yes i can paste that code directly in the right places in my rails project
[21:53:31] <littlebill902> but it won't render a progress bar
[21:53:40] <Cork> luite: keypress
[21:53:41] <thomedy> jquery html gives me the inner html right and .children searches for a matching child
[21:53:47] <thomedy> correct
[21:54:01] <Cork> luite: or keyup, depending on what you want
[21:54:22] <luite> Cork: that doesn't fire when the value is changed through the select menu
[21:54:30] <nowimproved1> why what are you looking for though ^zoggy^ ?
[21:54:39] <Cork> littlebill902: if you inspect the html, does it have any extra classes or anything ?
[21:54:44] <Cork> (in the browser)
[21:55:05] <^zoggy^> something more lightweight.. no js requirement.. css only.. support images/etc
[21:55:12] <Cork> luite: ah, ya that wouldn't one min
[21:55:19] <^zoggy^> i found: http://css3menu.com/elegant-dark-menu.html
[21:55:26] <littlebill902> nope when inspect the code all i see is <div id="progressbar"></div>
[21:55:34] <Cork> luite: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select
[21:55:40] <nowimproved1> ok ^zoggy^ i suggest looking at stu nicols http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/
[21:56:20] <luite> Cork: yeah i know but that one is called before the value is changed....
[21:56:51] <littlebill902> in my .js file i have
[21:56:52] <littlebill902> $(function() {
[21:56:52] <littlebill902>     $( "#progressbar" ).progressbar({
[21:56:52] <littlebill902>         value: 37
[21:56:52] <littlebill902>     });
[21:56:52] <littlebill902> });
[21:57:10] <Cork> littlebill902: don't past multible lines of code in the channel
[21:57:14] <littlebill902> sorry
[21:57:19] <^zoggy^> nowimproved1, i've looked there. .but nothing looked decent
[21:57:38] <^zoggy^> http://new.ligonier.org/
[21:57:41] <^zoggy^> wasnt bad either
[21:57:41] <Cork> luite: do a setTimeout(function() {}, 0); to let it update the field
[21:58:02] <Whirl3d> ?.on()
[21:58:06] <nowimproved1> really though ^zoggy^ superfish is fairly light weight though bud.. but just use son of suckerfish.. the only js is for ie
[21:58:35] <Whirl3d> anybody got a link to the new event delegation model .on() ?
[21:58:35] <nowimproved1> you can mod it to do anything you want
[21:58:37] <luite> Cork: ugh.. ;p talk about ugly, but I guess it will work :)
[21:59:28] <Cork> luite: the alternative is .change, but it won't trigger until it loses focus
[22:00:00] <^zoggy^> nowimproved1, i do already and i have
[22:00:06] <^zoggy^> but just not that impressed with it
[22:00:16] <Whirl3d> is bot-T working?
[22:00:28] <luite> Cork: yeah I noticed, that's why I came here to ask... I thought there would be a low-level change event for textfields, that fires on any change, but couldn't find one
[22:00:28] <Cork> ?help
[22:00:29] <nowimproved1> son of suckerfish? why not no js.. i could do anything you possibly want with that menu
[22:00:37] <Cork> Whirl3d: nope
[22:00:54] <Whirl3d> drats. I can't find a link to the 1.7 api for .on()
[22:01:15] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:01:41] <Whirl3d> lol. I bet you think your pretty smart, huh. Thanks. Don't know why I didn't think of that.
[22:02:12] <Cork> Whirl3d: uh... wasn't it what you wanted?
[22:02:33] <Whirl3d> oh yeah. It was perfect. I was just embarrased and thought it was funny.
[22:02:39] <Whirl3d> thanks, seriously.
[22:03:02] <Whirl3d> I swear the older I get the quicker the simple stuff gets by me.
[22:03:44] <nowimproved1> ^zoggy^, that is basically using son of suckerfish with css3 for rounded corners bud
[22:04:09] <ikla> whats the best way to data to another page with jquery? I have my data in a JS var and I want to goto a new url with that data most likely a post without the form
[22:04:39] <crab> $.post
[22:04:43] <Cork> ikla: you would have to create a hidden form and submit it
[22:04:48] <Cork> crab: that doesn't reload the page
[22:05:35] <^zoggy^> nowimproved1, i'm using superfish and supersubs (support different width drop downs)
[22:05:37] <crab> you can go to a new url in the callback, though.
[22:05:47] <Cork> not if its cross domain
[22:06:00] <^zoggy^> can son of suckerfish do differnet width dropdowns natively?
[22:06:19] <Cork> crab: well you can, but it won't send the data to the page while it goes
[22:06:22] <thomedy> okay some how i have to stick inside a block of content... i wast thinking i could click search up the parents with parent() and find a specific parent div and then back downt he tree with children...
[22:06:33] <thomedy> if i have one matching div for all parents
[22:06:42] <thomedy> that should worok right
[22:06:56] <nowimproved1> right ^zoggy^ check this menu i just made.. pretty clean and simple http://forums.nerdster.com.au/
[22:07:06] <ikla> Cork, ok
[22:35:37] <lukeholder> ok I got a weird on
[22:35:41] <lukeholder> one
[22:36:02] <Sugitime> Sounds like a personal problem to me...
[22:38:09] <lukeholder> haha
[22:38:41] <coldhead> Sugitime++

[22:41:03] <krn0> dumb question, how did u take a full screen shot lol
[22:41:23] <jedimind> its not coded, it's just a design in photoshop
[22:41:31] <rookie84> i have a draggable and a sortable, when i move an element to the sortable area i want an icon to appear in the widget, how can it be done?
[22:41:39] <coldhead> obviously, or you'd have linked to the html jedimind
[22:41:46] <jedimind> he asked coldhead
[22:41:51] <jedimind> how i took a screenshot of it
[22:41:52] <coldhead> should be fun to cutup in html5
[22:42:03] <coldhead> oh right
[22:42:11] <coldhead> i was about to abuse him for asking how to take screenshots
[22:42:15] <jedimind> :)
[22:42:15] <coldhead> but he was asking you
[22:42:22] <coldhead> ME SO SORRY
[22:42:38] <rookie84> anyone for my question please?
[22:42:39] <jedimind> <3
[22:42:50] <jedimind> rookie84, use the callbacks
[22:43:07] <rookie84> not sure how to use them with the draggable, sortable.
[22:43:09] <rookie84> let me check
[22:43:12] <jedimind> there's an onclick and onletgo or something events you use rookie84 to show/hid your icon
[22:43:13] <krn0> lol yeah shouldnt be asking that
[22:43:26] <jedimind> its in the documentation
[22:43:30] <rookie84> ok thanks, i'll check
[23:04:16] <coldhead> Committed revision 146993.

[23:12:25] <rookie84> again with a question: how can i dump a javascript variable?
[23:13:13] <styol> console.log(var);
[23:13:14] <Cork> rook2pawn: console.log(var_name)
[23:13:19] <Cork> lol
[23:13:42] <coldhead> some people like console.dir(var_name) too
[23:13:55] <coldhead> and props to Cork for not using a reserved word in his example <3
[23:13:58] <rookie84> ok and about jquery ui
[23:13:59] <styol> but coldhead prefers alert(var_name);
[23:14:04] <rookie84> update: function(event, ui)
[23:14:06] <coldhead> hahaha i sure do
[23:14:07] <styol> woops ;)
[23:14:11] <rookie84> what possible variables does ui have ?
[23:14:53] <rookie84> i couldn't find on their documentation
[23:15:03] <Cork> rook2pawn: console.log(arguments) ?
[23:15:17] <Cork> or what is it your looking for?
[23:15:30] <rookie84> $('#sortable').sortable({ 			revert: 'true', 			update: function(e, ui) {
[23:15:42] <rookie84> i want to know what variables are associated with the ui parameter
[23:15:58] <Cork> rook2pawn: ah, console.log(ui) then
[23:16:06] <rookie84> also what i want to do is know the text of the <li> that is dropped into the sortable
[23:16:15] <Cork> or check there demo page, it should be mentioned there (if they haven't removed it)
[23:16:28] <rookie84> 		$('#sortable').sortable({ 			revert: 'true', 			update: function(e, ui) { 				alert($(this).find('li').text()); 			},
[23:16:36] <rookie84> this returns all of the <li>'s text
[23:16:47] <rookie84> i want only the current li's that is dropped texzt
[23:16:52] <rookie84> any idea cork?
[23:16:57] <rookie84> for the rook2pawn buddy :p
[23:17:13] <Cork> lol
[23:17:24] <Cork> didn't even notice i used the wrong nick :)
[23:17:32] <rookie84> really?
[23:17:33] <rookie84> hahaah
[23:17:51] <Cork> rookie84: check the owerview tab in http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[23:17:55] <Cork> its listed there
[23:18:01] <rookie84> checking
[23:18:30] <Cork> and you prob want to use ui.item.text()
[23:18:41] <Cork> not $(this).find('li').text()
[23:19:10] <rookie84> yeh got it, thanks!
[23:19:17] <rookie84> rook2pawn, perhaps this is someone else who hangs out here?
[23:19:43] <rookie84> oh yeh there's one haha
[23:19:45] <rookie84> anyway
[23:19:54] <rookie84> thanks for the help, lots of people here btw.
[23:26:15] <helllen> helllo again
[23:26:39] <helllen> how could I search a component (input) checked and visible
[23:26:55] <helllen> I do know checked or visible but both
[23:27:23] <helllen> $("input:visible")     $("input:checked")
[23:28:08] <Brodingo> $('input:visible:checked')
[23:29:06] <helllen> $('input#group-selector:"visible,checked"')
[23:29:16] <Brodingo> uhhh
[23:29:25] <Brodingo> wut
[23:30:04] <helllen> $('input#group-selector:visible:checked')  return empty
[23:33:18] <coldhead> that should work, helllen
[23:34:17] <helllen> ok
[23:34:20] <helllen> thanks a lot
[23:34:40] <coldhead> another way is  $('input#group-selector:visible').filter(':checked')
[23:34:57] <coldhead> should do the same thing but slower
