[00:05:40] <niftylettuce> anyone know how to do a callback on jwysiwyg?
[00:06:12] <niftylettuce> problem is, <textarea> object changes if you set it before the $.wysiwyg call, and so if you reference back to the <textarea> object it is not the new element as $.wysiwyg defines

[00:59:17] <heatxsink> hi does anyone know if i can add an id name to the getScript call?

[01:03:44] <ocf> 'llo all. Do I have to set "display:none" with inline style for $.toggle to work? Setting it in CSS doesn't work. Is there a better method for toggling visibility?
[01:05:18] <heatxsink> ocf: i've done that with adding / removing css classes
[01:07:32] <K1ng> anyone from thailand?
[01:11:48] <ocf> heatxsink - thx yeah that would work
[01:12:12] <heatxsink> ocf: yw
[01:13:19] <heatxsink> is there a way of unloading a external js reference from the dom?
[01:14:58] <JoeCoolDesk> Why does animating on hover build up in a queue?
[01:15:16] <JoeCoolDesk> Like if you move your mouse over a lot and stop it keeps going for a while
[01:15:24] <JoeCoolDesk> It should just stop when you take your mouse off

[01:43:38] <johanhar> Hi. In the success function(data) in a ajax request, how can I check if data is empty? Datatype is JSON, I tried this: "data.length !== 0", that didnt work. If I alert(data.length) when there are some data, the result is "undefined"
[01:43:43] <aaronmcadam> anyone know the best way to refresh the page on jq mobile?
[01:44:47] <aaronmcadam> or how would you do it normally, window.location = window.location?
[01:47:49] <aaronmcadam> johanhar if ( !data ) { ... } should be enough
[01:50:38] <johanhar> aaronmcadam: thanks, but now I use !($.isEmptyObject(data)), but that seems easier :)

[01:52:38] <JoeCoolDesk> If you're not doing anything, why do you join so you can log all the shit you don't care to read?
[01:53:05] <markj> why do you care? i join in the morning, then leave at night, speaking when i want to
[01:53:42] <JoeCoolDesk> Is your log file growing 10MB a day?
[01:53:58] <markj> probably, but its not like i cant sort that out
[01:55:22] <johanhar> JoeCoolDesk: where are you from? Maybe the time-zone youre from is not as "popular" on this channel.
[01:55:31] <JoeCoolDesk> Central zone
[01:55:36] <johanhar> Those who would normaly be here to help you, are sleeping then...
[01:57:20] <JoeCoolDesk> What time is it where you are?
[01:57:26] <johanhar> CET, like you

[02:01:05] <Dp-supreme1> hi
[02:02:09] <aaronmcadam> yo
[02:03:02] <Bodu> hello. i load content with .load in the content is a link with the name testa. if the content loads an i click on the link ill get the alert twice. why? http://pastebin.com/0xHKqKb0
[02:03:47] <Ontolog> I'm appending elements to a parent element and it seems that parent_element.children().length does not get updated immediately
[02:08:39] <JoeCoolDesk> Alright I've got one for you
[02:08:49] <JoeCoolDesk> Since everybody is up now
[02:08:52] <JoeCoolDesk> Right?
[02:09:08] <JoeCoolDesk> I just put in four lines and it doesn't matter
[02:09:36] <JoeCoolDesk> I'm looking at crashworks.co and when I hover over the images they dissappear at the end of the animation
[02:09:46] <JoeCoolDesk> Why is that and what is the solution?'
[02:11:28] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[02:18:11] <JoeCoolDesk> Oh, because it overflows technically
[02:22:39] <coolokey> Hi, a question for all you, when you're programming for a long hour , do you listening something like music or programming whithout listening to anything
[02:22:54] <j_wright> yes
[02:23:01] <JoeCoolDesk> Pandora or talk radio
[02:23:45] <jchillerup> Hi, I'm trying to model the table part of a spreadsheet (i.e., no calculations or expressions). How would I go about implementing selecting a block of cells (the dragging of rectangles over the table)? Is it possible on a mouseenter event to see if the left mouse button is held down during the mouseenter event?
[02:24:08] <jchillerup> coolokey: somafm.com, usually indie pop rocks
[02:32:45] <JoeCoolDesk> How do you set the position to absolute to take it out of the flow of the page without changing the actual position of anything?
[02:33:09] <JoeCoolDesk> Basically I want to pop an element out and move it arbitrarily
[02:35:36] <Dp-supreme1> can someone test some code on Internet Explorer 9? when i use $("#sidenav").show("slide", { direction: "left" }, durata1); it doesn't work on ie9 but i works only with up direction... the strange thing is that it works on jsfiddle but not when the code is in a normal page.
[02:36:24] <macheleon> JoeCoolDesk: pop a new element in it's place, Indiana Jones style
[02:36:44] <macheleon> although that didn't work so well for him
[02:36:54] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, observe http://crashworks.co
[02:36:55] <noaXess> hey all
[02:37:01] <noaXess> in this function http://paste.ubuntu.com/628434/ the variable protection is still 0 even if data == "YES" is that cause $.get is running parallel to the function it self?
[02:37:11] <macheleon> right
[02:37:23] <noaXess> macheleon: right to my question?
[02:37:33] <macheleon> no sorry noaXess, right to JoeCoolDesk
[02:37:38] <noaXess> aha ;)..
[02:37:39] <JoeCoolDesk> Right to me?
[02:38:03] <aaronmcadam> noaXess, yeah
[02:38:19] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: so yes to my question ;)
[02:38:36] <aaronmcadam> yep
[02:38:44] <aaronmcadam> you *could* set async to false
[02:38:51] <macheleon> yes JoeCoolDesk, right to JoeCoolDesk. what's need on that site?
[02:39:00] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: is that the common solution?
[02:39:03] <macheleon> s/need/needed
[02:39:03] <aaronmcadam> or else try to return protection from inside the get callback
[02:39:10] <aaronmcadam> nope
[02:39:27] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: if i retunr protection insice $.get i get undefined
[02:39:44] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, hover over one of the images. Desired effect is to have it take up the whole 960 width.  Right now it's just expanding past the overflow and dissappearing.
[02:40:11] <JoeCoolDesk> I figure I position it to the left at the same time as expanding over the elements instead of pushing them out of the way
[02:40:43] <aaronmcadam> noaXess, try using the full $.ajax func with async : false
[02:41:25] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: ok... so use $.ajax for the request?
[02:41:34] <aaronmcadam> yea
[02:41:41] <b-> anybody know of any "fun" jQuery plugins ?
[02:41:50] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: isn't it possible in $.get to set async:false?
[02:42:04] <larsemil> if i have ten links on a page,and i click one. how do i select the first element with .foo that appears above the link?
[02:42:05] <noaXess> b-: search on jquery.com
[02:42:32] <aaronmcadam> noaXess, get is just a convenience/shortcut method
[02:42:34] <macheleon> JoeCoolDesk: where do you set the desired final width?
[02:42:50] <JoeCoolDesk> JS in the bottom
[02:43:01] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: aha.. right. ok.. and with $.ajax i can do more options.. i see.. reading it now on the api browser
[02:43:30] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon: $(this).animate({left: '0', width: '949px'});
[02:44:19] <macheleon> oh wow it didn't even all load for me at first
[02:44:23] <b-> hehe noaXess
[02:44:24] <macheleon> I only saw one pic
[02:44:47] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, I'm changing it around a lot right now so you probably saw it when the position was stacked all on each other.
[02:44:48] <noaXess> b-: there are a lot of fun plugins.. you have to specify what you really need for which function..
[02:44:58] <b-> I was more or so polling for something popular among us developers
[02:44:59] <macheleon> ok that's probably not going to help things
[02:45:10] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, to get it it has to have the left: preset almost.
[02:45:10] <b-> but I understand ;)
[02:45:12] <noaXess> b-: my way is always look a dates/update dates of plugins.. so you are shure they are maintainend..
[02:45:45] <noaXess> b-: and testing around to get your choice...
[02:46:04] <noaXess> b-: i use some core plugins in my apps.... and have tested them a lot..
[02:46:58] <kanna> can u please give the syntax of validate.addMethod?
[02:50:08] * b- sad panda
[02:50:57] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: thanks.. i got it.. :)
[02:51:27] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:51:49] <noaXess> kanna: what you mean exaclty?.. validate... is it a jquery main function.. or from a plugin?
[02:52:30] <aaronmcadam> the plugin
[02:53:12] <aaronmcadam> there isn't a "main" function in jQuery noaXess
[02:53:33] <PERECil_> hmmm how can it comes that $( 'form' ).serialize() throw this error: TypeError: this.map(function () {return this.elements ? f.makeArray(this.elements) : this;}) is undefined
[02:53:51] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: i mean like $.get.. thats a jquery function.. not from a plugin.
[02:53:54] <aaronmcadam> kanna, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[02:54:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah I know what u meant noaXess
[02:54:12] <noaXess> aaronmcadam: the validation plugin.. aha.. i know that. and also use it
[02:55:11] <Bodu> hello. i load content with .load. in the content is a link with the name testa. if the content loads and i click on the link ill get the alert twice. why? http://pastebin.com/0xHKqKb0
[02:55:32] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, you see it?
[02:57:17] <macheleon> JoeCoolDesk: no more changes? if not, the first one seems to be doing what you're telling it to
[02:57:41] <JoeCoolDesk> Yeah I'm not changing it if you're looking at it now.
[02:58:06] <macheleon> I'm not sure what your desired result is though
[02:58:08] <jmvelasco> hi my best wishes for today to all !
[02:58:10] <JoeCoolDesk> The first one doesn't need anything because it's already set to the far left.  The other ones need to animate to the left as they grow.
[02:58:17] <jmvelasco> *to everybody
[02:58:20] <macheleon> oh I see
[02:59:06] <jmvelasco> I need your help collegues, I need to cancel the validation of one fiesld in one case, I set class="cancel" but the validation is still taking place... what am i skipping please ?
[02:59:09] <jmvelasco> <input type="text" readonly="readonly" class="cancel" id="terminal_identifier" value="NEO-0879" name="terminal_identifier">
[02:59:35] <jmvelasco> an input like this should not call to validation, shoudn't it ?
[02:59:45] <jmvelasco> thanks in advance
[03:00:04] <jmvelasco> *should it ?
[03:00:06] <macheleon> JoeCoolDesk: the left:'0' parameter in .animate() will move it 0 pixels to the left
[03:00:24] <aaronmcadam> how are u calling it jmcantrell
[03:00:29] <aaronmcadam> how are u calling it jmvelasco
[03:01:11] <JoeCoolDesk> macheleon, should it be relative inside absolute or absolute inside relative in terms of hierarchy?
[03:01:39] <macheleon> anything absolute will be relative to it's nearest relatively positioned parent
[03:01:42] <aaronmcadam> JoeCoolDesk, usually it's abs inside relative as you reset the flow for that container
[03:01:46] <jmvelasco> aaronmcadam, http://pastebin.com/xyQPpmHp line 16
[03:02:01] <macheleon> so yeah usually it's absolute inside relative
[03:02:46] <jmvelasco> after, when I render the form i check one condition and if this is the case i add class="cancel" to that input control
[03:02:47] <jmvelasco> 	        if ($tipo_alta == 'inventory'){
[03:02:47] <jmvelasco> 	            $data['readonly'] = 'readonly';
[03:02:47] <jmvelasco> 	            $data['class'] .= 'cancel';
[03:02:47] <jmvelasco> 	        }
[03:02:57] <JoeCoolDesk> Alright, well see now setting to absolute sets it so they're not in a nice row.
[03:03:06] <JoeCoolDesk> Do I have to manually set the left: for each of them?
[03:03:17] <jmvelasco> I don't know what I am doing wrong, one hand here will be appreciate
[03:03:52] <jmvelasco> maybe I need to chagen my stratergy of doing this validation
[03:03:56] <jmvelasco> *change
[03:04:25] <aaronmcadam> why don't you filter on the cancel class
[03:10:15] <jchillerup> Is it possible with mouseenter to determine if a key was pressed prior to firing the mouseenter event?
[03:10:28] <jchillerup> (i.e. mouse entering with key pressed)
[03:10:34] <Lee_msi> Anyone familiar with bassistance.de's tooltip plugin ?
[03:10:38] <makinen> I've links inside td cells. I've binded a click handler each of them: $('#remove_quick_fee').click(function() {
[03:10:54] <makinen> 			remove_quick_fee();
[03:10:54] <makinen> 					});
[03:11:46] <makinen> what's the correct way to pass the object referring to the clicked link to the remove_quick_fee function?
[03:12:11] <Lee_msi> this
[03:12:41] <makinen> remove_quick_fee(this)?
[03:12:42] <Lee_msi> "this" will always refer to the element the event triggered on
[03:12:47] <Lee_msi> yup
[03:12:47] <makinen> ok
[03:15:49] <kapowaz> is there some way of determining which events an element responds to with jQuery?
[03:16:05] <larsemil> why does this not work? i try to get the latest .hiddentext before the button clicked (this)  : $(this).prev('.hiddentext').html()
[03:16:10] <jmvelasco> hi again i can't figure out other stratergy, i was trying but no success
[03:16:22] <jmvelasco> why class="cancel" is not canceling the validation ???
[03:16:42] <jmvelasco> i don't undertand, please one help around ?¿
[03:16:59] <jmvelasco> <input type="text" readonly="readonly" class="cancel error" id="terminal_identifier" value="NEO-0184B" name="terminal_identifier">
[03:17:18] <jmvelasco> this is the input copied form firebug code source
[03:17:28] <jmvelasco> so class="cancel" is setted
[03:17:53] <jmvelasco> but validation plugin still makes the validation, i feel lost
[03:18:00] <jmvelasco> * does
[03:19:08] <Joric> how to scroll div in a loop? is there any solutions?
[03:20:23] <Trisox>  $('.articleTable:eq(' + i + ').find('.hiddenArticleRowNumber').val().is(el.lineId).end().find('.articlePrice').html(el.price).end().find('.articleTotalPrice').html(el.totalPrice).end(); any one knows wy i cant do this?
[03:21:14] <larsemil> i have: <div class="hiddentext">text</div> <a class="readmore">Read more</a> on several places on the page.
[03:21:26] <larsemil> how do i get the div closest to the link clicked?
[03:21:49] <larsemil> i tried $(this).prev('.hiddentext')
[03:21:53] <larsemil> but to no luck
[03:24:49] <Ontolog> is there an editable text lib that doesn't suck? :(
[03:24:52] <gnarf> ?closest @larionov
[03:25:03] <bot-t> larionov, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:25:06] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/closest @larsemil
[03:29:39] <larsemil> gnarf: console.log(jQuery(this).closest('.hiddentext')) returns empty, allthough there is a .hiddentext...

[03:30:14] <timing> Hi!

[03:37:22] <gnarf> larsemil: although i could probably write a better one for 1.5 ajax calls

[03:38:54] <aaronmcadam> cool
[03:38:55] <gnarf> hey Bittarman
[03:38:57] <aaronmcadam> cheers man
[03:38:59] <Bittarman> hey :)
[03:40:01] <gnarf> Bittarman: you normally lurk here, or did a question with jquery send you our way? :)
[03:41:31] <larsemil> gnarf: you thinking about timing now right?
[03:41:49] <gnarf> larsemil: ?
[03:41:58] <larsemil> 12:37 < gnarf> larsemil: although i could probably write a better one for 1.5 ajax calls
[03:42:12] <gnarf> larsemil: oh, nah, not so much about timing
[03:42:29] <gnarf> just that one of the advantages of 1.5 ajax calls is the deferreds
[03:42:43] <gnarf> and I could probably do it using a preFilter
[03:46:31] <Bittarman> gnarf, just though I'd start lurking, as we're using jQuery for some things now
[03:46:33] <gnarf> larsemil: i think something jaubourgs talk at jqcon might of touched on queuing ajax
[03:46:49] <gnarf> Bittarman: cool, good to have ya ;)
[03:46:57] <Bittarman> :D
[03:49:03] <larsemil> gnarf: but i was never interested in queing ajax. :D thanks anyway
[03:49:33] <gnarf> larsemil: hrm, yeah, timing then ;)
[03:49:47] <Bodu> i loaded a form with .load('form.html'). if i want to .ajax the values of the forms, an alert says me that the input.vals are undefined. why? and how can i solve this problem?
[03:50:01] <gnarf> ?p @Bodu
[03:50:04] <bot-t> Bodu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[03:50:47] <Bodu> a moment please
[03:52:58] <Bodu> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/415278/
[03:53:47] <gnarf> Bodu: and what is $("#name").length ?
[03:54:05] <gnarf> my initial thought - you have no input with the id="name"
[03:54:32] <timing> jquery's success callback is called at the very end of a request right? not during ob_flush() and such?
[03:54:46] <Bodu> i have an input
[03:55:13] <Bodu> timing do you mean me?
[03:55:15] <gnarf> timing: its called when the request is received by the browser --- it has nothing to do with your server side
[03:55:21] <gnarf> Bodu: and what is $("#name").length ?
[03:56:06] <Bodu> 1 letter - 100 ? different but still min one.
[03:56:57] <gnarf> Bodu: dude
[03:56:59] <gnarf> listen
[03:57:11] <gnarf> instead of $("#name").val() please try $("#name").length
[03:57:16] <gnarf> and tell me what it is
[03:57:55] <Bodu> gnarf: 1
[03:58:15] <Bodu> gnarf: after i close the alert another popups with 0
[03:59:04] <gnarf> Bodu: also, that if event.preventDefault is pointless
[03:59:20] <timing> Bodu: uhh no, just a question to the channel :-)
[04:00:03] <Bodu> gnarf:dont understand what you want to tell mit with that
[04:00:36] <timing> gnarf: ok, success is fired when the reuqest is received, but is the request also finished?
[04:01:02] <gnarf> Bodu: you don't need to check, jQuery makes sure you have a .preventDefault() method
[04:02:04] <Bodu> i worked for about one year with it and i had a problem if i dont do it this way. dunno if it works now withouth this check. but i dont think that this matters for my problem.
[04:02:08] <gnarf> Bodu: why are there two alerts, are you alerting something else?
[04:03:10] <Bodu> nope just this one alert($("#name").length); in my code. i asked a few minutes ago about this twice alert problem but i think nobody answered. if i close the first alert with 1 another popups with 0.
[04:04:06] <gnarf> Bodu: sounds like you're sending that request twice?
[04:04:11] <gnarf> does that event handler fire twice?
[04:04:19] <gnarf> are you binding it twice?
[04:04:58] <Bodu> i dont think so. i think i posted all needed code for this problem.
[04:06:28] <Bodu> i remember that i had a problem like this befor. but i realy dont know how i solved it :-(
[04:07:06] <gnarf> breakpoints?
[04:07:10] <gnarf> alerts?
[04:07:12] <gnarf> debug it?
[04:07:19] <gnarf> i dunno, i can't actually run that code
[04:07:22] <gnarf> so its hard to debug
[04:08:56] <Bodu> i know. hmm.. firebugs dont send any errors.

[04:19:32] <Bodu> gnarf: i figured out that the data is sended twice. first time with correct values. and second time with undefined values. the first data sends before beforeSend is shown and the 2nd one sends when beforeSends is shown.
[04:20:27] <Bodu> gnarf: i think the problem has to do with that i loaded the form with ajax.
[04:29:58] <Bodu> ok i found what i did in the past to solve this problem. i used the plugin livequery and changed .live with .livequery. anyone knows how to prevent sending data twice without using livequery plugin?
[04:32:09] <Bodu> using click instead of live works too
[04:33:26] <Predat0r> so, any idea how to reset toggle if i click other button to clove the target div?

[04:34:47] <macheleon> is it normal for a jquery ui dialog that loads from an external file to perform slower after numerous repeated loadings?
[04:39:16] <dtach> Hi im using a live click $("#GoBackDown").live("click", function () {}); the irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#GoBackDownÂ button is created at some point by another function. My button wont perform whats inside the live click when it is created. But for some reason when i run the function that creates it Again. The button does work. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/gH4UC/
[04:41:21] <Cork> dtach: does GoBackDown exist more then once in your html code?
[04:41:41] <Cork> ex do you generate the html more then once or something like that

[04:52:47] <innociv> Ugh.  I need to load pages via ajax, but the pages are constantly being updated by users, both editing and new results, so the number of pages increase.  I need some way to cache.
[04:53:28] <innociv> But I can't really just put a hash to show if the thread has changed, as that's not going to do it for each page.

[05:24:24] <jmvelasco> coldhead, I need to cancel validation in one case, I correctly set class = "cancel" but the validation is still done ... I feel lost
[05:24:30] <jmvelasco> what am i skipping please ?
[05:24:37] <jmvelasco> i will try to paste all the relevant code
[05:25:52] <coldhead> jmvelasco: i thought you indicated failure by returning false
[05:25:58] <coldhead> and success is return true?
[05:26:33] <jmvelasco> http://jsfiddle.net/EJTCe/1/
[05:26:57] <jmvelasco> coldhead, that is the html part (that is rendered dinamically) and JS validation
[05:27:20] <jmvelasco> in the case the selected option is 'inventory' i add class='cancel' to the input box
[05:27:38] <jmvelasco> but the way the validation is done
[05:28:19] <jmvelasco> to use a validation method was another try trying to get the option selected, but i can't achieve to get it since i get the default option, not the user one
[05:28:47] <jmvelasco> my main problem is i don't know why is not canceling the validation if i set class="cancel"
[05:29:21] <coldhead> is the validation plugin supposed to do that?
[05:29:33] <coldhead> i've never heard of that behaviour before :(
[05:30:23] <coldhead> jmvelasco: do you have a link to the docs about "cancel"?
[05:30:48] <jmvelasco> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203844/jquery-validation-plugin-disable-validation-for-specified-submit-buttons

[05:32:47] <coldhead> jmvelasco: that only works for submit buttons
[05:32:51] <jmvelasco> coldhead, maybe it is to cancel all validation and not one rule

[05:36:02] <afeijo> hi guys, I'm using click() handler to some links, now I need to use drag & drop. When I click to drag and release it, the click() is evoked, but in that case it shouldn't, how can I control this?
[05:37:23] <coldhead> ?unbind @ afeijo
[05:37:24] <bot-t> afeijo, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[05:37:44] <afeijo> coldhead, I will have to unbind then bind back?
[05:38:02] <coldhead> if you want to catch clicks again, then yes
[05:38:12] <dts> I've just found a bug with .data() if there is no data object available
[05:38:15] <afeijo> hmmm ok, tricky
[05:38:30] <coldhead> but its probably simpler than teaching your click handler to ignore certain clicks
[05:38:38] <coldhead> a click is a click is a click
[05:38:46] <coldhead> catch it or ignore it
[05:39:03] <coldhead> are you sure it's a bug, dts?
[05:40:17] <jmvelasco> ignore doesn't work as i expect neither coldhead
[05:40:19] <jmvelasco> :/
[05:41:12] <afeijo> coldhead, I'm using the jquery.ui drag plugin, with the 'helper': 'clone' value, it stopped clicking!! fabulous
[05:41:48] <afeijo> now I just need to figure out how to control the drop part so I can evoke an ajax :)
[05:42:11] <coldhead> dtach: http://jsfiddle.net/gH4UC/3/
[05:42:14] <coldhead> it works for me
[05:42:36] <coldhead> is it maybe : duplicate IDs or a JS error with GoodbyeMessage or holderH or holderW being undefined?
[05:43:00] <coldhead> good luck, afeijo!
[05:43:47] <coldhead> jmvelasco: validate() assumes you are not going to add and remove classes once it is initialised
[05:44:21] <coldhead> if you need to change the behaviour based on new classes you probably have to write a new custom handler that tests for them and works with the current values
[05:44:44] <coldhead> it is not a common problem
[05:44:59] <jmvelasco> coldhead, finally i got it
[05:45:14] <jmvelasco> i was adding ignore as a rule, and it should be a characteristique
[05:45:20] <jmvelasco> outside rules {}
[05:45:41] <jmvelasco> now adding ignore class when i need to ignore this validation works :D
[05:45:52] <coldhead> oh good
[05:45:59] <jmvelasco> did you got me, in the case you'll need sometime ?
[05:46:12] <coldhead> i will never need that :)
[05:46:17] <coldhead> i don't ever use jQuery
[05:46:19] <jmvelasco> we never know :)
[05:46:32] <jmvelasco> hahaah, so what are you doing in its channel
[05:46:32] <jmvelasco> lol
[05:46:49] <coldhead> i don't know how to close the window

[05:47:34] <jmvelasco> :p
[05:48:42] <tiagoa> I'm doing an ajax request each second. when the page is refreshed, the error message is showed. i think the refresh action happens when the ajax request is being made: http://jsfiddle.net/T8Sxc/
[05:48:48] <dtach> no errors sadly and the code inside the button works fine the 2nd time it is created
[05:49:03] <dtach> and sorry should have made my jsfiddle as good as yours to show how it works
[05:49:19] <dtach> i have it just like the fiddle, if only i had an error to work with
[05:49:45] <dtach> i tried class instead of id too but that didnt help
[05:49:47] <coldhead> dtach: the problem must be something else in your code? that isn't shown?
[05:49:56] <coldhead> are you using .ready() ?
[05:50:17] <dtach> yes
[05:53:49] <macheleon> coldhead I got that cake for you

[06:14:47] <stenno> good day, when i use .bind, does it implicate .live, i.e. will the handler be bound to the event even if the element does not exist on start?

[06:15:04] <stenno> ok, thanks
[06:15:10] <stenno> so i will use .live

[06:47:10] <alpaca> is there a simple reason why .animate() would successfully animate to the new height, but not the width?
[06:48:09] <craigza> alpaca : code
[06:48:19] <alpaca> craigza: sure, just a moment.
[06:49:17] <alpaca> craigza: http://pastebin.com/sPmrwWsJ
[06:49:42] <momito> i have a question folks, if i load a .css background through jquery, is it possible to fade it in but only after it has been completely loaded?
[06:50:00] <Clorith> Is there any reason why a .each inside a .live function won't see the changes i nthe elements I'm looping ? (Using it at http://linux01.hjelseth.com/eltervaag/lager-containere/ by clicking the checkboxes the totals on the side shows up, but it done'st calculate any totals as it can't see the table rows)
[06:51:09] <craigza> mmm your code looks good alpaca, even tried it myself
[06:51:14] <alpaca> oh dear god, is it my trailing comma >.>
[06:51:32] <alpaca> no no nevermind, its not
[06:52:37] <craigza> alpaca: might be a css issue, css block it or float left
[06:54:38] <alpaca> craigza: i also think its a css issue, just cant figure out exactly what...
[06:54:41] <alpaca> craigza: http://i.imgur.com/tspZN.png
[06:54:56] <alpaca> thjats what it shows after hover
[06:55:22] <alpaca> the height values show correctly
[06:56:06] <afeijo> how can I know if ui.draggable is loaded? I'm trying with if (typeof window.ui.draggable == 'function')
[06:56:38] <craigza> check for !important on width
[06:56:55] <craigza> else... just kill the width in css for now
[07:02:40] <momito> is it possible to load something in jquery but only once the following has been completely loaded first? $('#fullscreenbg').css('background-image','url("img/' + img + '.jpg")');
[07:05:45] <Hierofant> momito $(document).ready()
[07:06:00] <dabear> incorrect
[07:06:10] <momito> its a dynamic variable though\
[07:06:26] <dabear> document can be ready before the newly set background iamge is finished
[07:07:34] <momito> exactly what dabear says
[07:08:07] <swans> can anyone help me to make a sliding unordered list more usable?
[07:08:23] <momito> because it changes on hover i need to somehow tell it to wait till the img has been loaded before fading it in
[07:09:02] <dabear> momito: .load will work for <img>
[07:09:09] <dabear> but dunno about css
[07:09:34] <tarzeau> could i unbind the call to jquery at http://sid.ethz.ch/.aiei/ and bind it new at another place (several divs, one visible at a time)?
[07:09:46] <swans> anyone?
[07:09:47] <tarzeau> if so, what would be the exact syntax call like?
[07:10:02] <momito> yeah i dont think .load works for .css unfortunately
[07:10:16] <ramvi> jQuery Mobile manipulates the html before showing it. Can I append html to the page with jQuery and activate this process afterwards on a loaded page?
[07:10:30] <ramvi> Say i want to append a <a href="" data-role="button"> and want it to be formatted by jq mobile
[07:10:50] <momito> the script is for the following http://advacomftp.nl/scripts/basic
[07:11:30] <momito> if the browser hasnt cashed the images yet, it will show the image too early/late on the first load
[07:11:47] <momito> it functions normally once the images have been cashed though
[07:12:43] <momito> cached*
[07:20:57] <d3str0y> Where can I take a gander at some AJAX/jQuery scripts for dynamically loading content into a page
[07:21:16] <d3str0y> I made something myself and it was working but I can't seem to figure out how to make it work with php now
[07:22:00] <d3str0y> what do you think the best way to load in content is, through a bunch of html or php files or one big XML file?
[07:22:22] <momito> well the documentation on the jquery site has some examples to learn from
[07:22:53] <momito> i personally always use php files, since most ajax i use sends data and recieves data based on the info sent
[07:27:01] <aaronmcadam> d3str0y, you should process and filter your xml on the server side, much faster
[07:27:30] <superjacaman> hey guys
[07:27:33] <d3str0y> not sure what you mean aaronmcadam
[07:27:40] <aaronmcadam> uh
[07:27:54] <aaronmcadam> not sure if I can put it any clearer really
[07:28:03] <d3str0y> ok, haha
[07:28:20] <aaronmcadam> emmm I mean what momito said,
[07:28:22] <d3str0y> I suppose you would have to elaborate
[07:28:37] <aaronmcadam> send some data to your server (php script maybe)
[07:28:54] <momito> what are you trying to load through the use ajax anyway d3str0y?
[07:28:58] <aaronmcadam> which returns only the data you need in json, ideally
[07:29:27] <swans> can anyone help me to make the sliding navigation on the top left more reasonable?
[07:29:28] <swans> http://www.swanseatimber.co.uk/shop/index.php
[07:30:03] <d3str0y> i've got a small website I make every year that has about 15 students and each one has a small bio, when you click on the name I'm loading in that content into the page instead of making a separate page for each student
[07:30:15] <d3str0y> it's not worth it to build a database or anything
[07:30:34] <orolo> i need to insert a span into a text string created from a substring. so, i have, abcdefghijk; and i need: abcd<span class="foo">efghijk</span>
[07:30:47] <d3str0y> and it's easier to change the page layout if there isn't 15 different pages for each student
[07:31:23] <aaronmcadam> so yeah
[07:31:34] <genka> xml file?
[07:31:37] <momito> hmm well if you're not going to use a database, then xml it is
[07:31:39] <aaronmcadam> why don't you just have some xml that you manipulate with php
[07:31:46] <aaronmcadam> and pass the script an id
[07:31:59] <momito> like aaronmcadam says
[07:32:04] <d3str0y> yeah it could be an xml file right now im just loading in an html file with the html for each student
[07:33:15] <d3str0y> I'm thinking about looking into doing it that way but I'm trying to weigh the time benefit =)
[07:33:25] <premapix> Has anyone got any tips on how to select the element next to (sibling to ) $(this) ?
[07:33:42] <d3str0y> thanks for helping me =)
[07:33:51] <aaronmcadam> the time benefit will be worth it
[07:34:03] <aaronmcadam> won't take that long anyway
[07:34:03] <premapix> (Have clicked on header and want to toggle element immediately below
[07:34:09] <orolo> premapix: $(this).next() or prev()
[07:34:33] <premapix> Orolo Thanks heaps. Saved my life :-)
[07:36:00] <JoeCoolDesk> Is there  a function to animate to a css on mouseover and go back automatically?
[07:37:16] <momito> i think you will have to use the .hover function
[07:37:19] <crankharder> how do I wait till all images inside an element are loaded before firing something?
[07:37:33] <d3str0y> I think I'm going to try and implement history.js
[07:37:36] <JoeCoolDesk> I am using the hover function
[07:37:42] <JoeCoolDesk> Doesn't go back automatically
[07:37:49] <JoeCoolDesk> And it's kind of broken
[07:37:54] <aaronmcadam> JoeCoolDesk,
[07:38:02] <aaronmcadam> why don't u cache what the css was before
[07:38:11] <aaronmcadam> outside your hover
[07:38:22] <aaronmcadam> and in the 2nd function passed to hover, set it back?
[07:38:52] <momito> as aaronmcadam said, just pass the original values back on the 2nd function
[07:38:53] <JoeCoolDesk> I'm trying to but it's not going back
[07:39:04] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddleeee
[07:39:19] <JoeCoolDesk> Plus when you wiggle the cursor over the element and stop the element goes crazy
[07:40:06] <momito> i use a script called hoverIntent to fix that
[07:40:35] <aaronmcadam> that's a known issue with animations
[07:40:46] <aaronmcadam> just the way it is seemingly
[07:41:12] <momito> small script and it makes sure hover scripts dont go crazy when people that have no steady hand hover over it
[07:41:15] <aaronmcadam> you need to animate().stop()
[07:41:45] <aaronmcadam> and yeah use that plugin momito's mentioned
[07:43:10] <momito> though first get your mouseout event fixed before adding other scripts imo
[07:45:52] <JoeCoolDesk> Yeah turns out I'm having trouble with that caching CSS thing
[07:48:14] <Segaja> hi, is it possible to continue the .each() loop if some condition matches? like using continue; in a for or while loop in plain JS
[07:52:13] <joshteam> Why doesn't the progress bar show up? -> http://jsfiddle.net/yRuS9/
[07:52:38] <aaronmcadam> Segaja, could you do the opposite, and do a if (!condition) { return; }
[07:54:46] <JoeCoolDesk> How do you select an element as well as its children?
[07:54:48] <aaronmcadam> haha joshteam, you're not including the plugin or anything there
[07:54:57] <aaronmcadam> JoeCoolDesk,
[07:55:05] <aaronmcadam> $(el).children().andSelf()
[07:55:16] <joshteam> aaronmcadam: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Progressbar
[07:55:22] <joshteam> aaronmcadam: I don't see where I get it?
[07:55:32] <aaronmcadam> is it not up on cdn somewhere
[07:55:45] <momito> http://jsfiddle.net/yRuS9/2/
[07:55:53] <momito> there the progressbar does work
[07:56:10] <joshteam> what did you change?
[07:56:20] <aaronmcadam> you had no dollar
[07:56:50] <aaronmcadam> (document).ready... instead of $(document)...
[07:57:10] <momito> yep
[07:57:26] <momito> as aaronmcadam said

[07:59:38] <Oli``> I'm trying to set the background-size CSS for an element but it's just ignoring me. Code seems to fire but nothing happens. I check the background size afterward and it's still "auto auto"
[08:00:49] <Oli``> This is my code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/629858/
[08:01:30] <Oli``> I've also tried setting it manually from firebug and it just returns the element without doing anything
[08:02:23] <Mobbb> hey, does anyone know how i can change the ammount of options in my menu list? i need to change it from 4 to 2
[08:03:48] <5EXACUDPT> is it possible to store a reference to an array element using $.data ?
[08:04:51] <Oli``> I've just found out that if I edit the CSS with Firebug's editor and then fire off a jquery .css command, it works... But not before. No idea what's going on.
[08:11:18] <Snugug> I would like to pass some PHP values I have into Javascript, what's the easiest way to do this?
[08:14:16] <momito> Oli``: i think your scripts fails at line 6
[08:14:29] <momito> at the parseInt
[08:14:51] <momito> it does return a value if you remove the parseInt command
[08:15:04] <Oli``> momito: it works here (the console.log pumps out the right stuff in firebug)
[08:16:21] <Oli``> $('#content').css('background-size', ...); is the bit that seems to just be ignored.
[08:17:33] <Oli``> Hmm. Might just be browser-specific. Chromium is getting along better with it.
[08:18:54] <momito> hmmm
[08:18:59] <momito> that is idd odd
[08:20:06] <craigza> Snugug: create a hidden inputbox... with the value, then js too pull it
[08:20:06] <momito> but isnt background-size CSS3?
[08:20:18] <Snugug> craigza: Hmm, ok
[08:20:48] <craigza> Snugug: thats how i do it... i hate reading php and js mixed
[08:21:12] <Snugug> craigza: Boo, okay
[08:27:45] <martco> i open an oauth popup with window.open
[08:27:53] <martco> how do i detect the closing of that window?
[08:28:33] <martco> i can't control the content of that popup but want to detect the closing
[08:28:38] <martco> thanks so much!
[08:28:52] <martco> i open an oauth popup with window.open
[08:28:56] <martco> how do i detect the closing of that window?
[08:29:07] <Mobbb> hey, does anyone know how i can change the ammount of options in my menu list? i need to change it from 4 to 2
[08:30:37] <alexidoia> how do you evaluate a string as the name of a var which you want to assign a value ? I have tried eval('myvar')='something' but it does not work.
[08:31:13] <littulb> any of you guys know how to SET query string using jquery or javascript???
[08:32:58] <martco> how do i detect the closing of a window ?
[08:33:08] <martco> when i can't control what's inside that window
[08:33:13] <martco> sorry if it's a dumb question
[08:35:12] <b0c1> hi how can I send standard submit with jquery.post ?
[08:35:31] <b0c1> (I not want to submit ajax, but I want to send custom json data, without create form by hand)
[08:38:37] <BillCriswell> b0c1: $('#form-id').submit() ?
[08:38:58] <b0c1> BillCriswell: ¨without create form¨... :)
[08:40:48] <BillCriswell> So just like... $.post( 'action.php', jsondata ); ?
[08:41:31] <b0c1> yeah
[08:41:43] <b0c1> :)
[08:41:59] <b0c1> and I not foudn any solution
[08:44:42] <Pfeifakopf> hi. how could i search for a string and make a span around it?
[08:44:54] <b0c1> BillCriswell: you have any idea?
[08:45:52] <Winters> Pfeifakopf: use the :contains() Selector and inset a span around it
[08:46:30] <Winters> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[08:49:29] <Pfeifakopf> Winters: the problem is, that i have a string inside the text, which i want to mark. with your solution i get all the text merked, but not just the string, right?
[08:55:58] <zmoazeni> Pfeifakopf: You could use "string".replace(/(regexp)/, "<span></span>") - I can't remember if javascript uses $1 or \1 for placeholders
[08:56:32] <zmoazeni> Pfeifakopf: Fairly sure that's a javascript thing and not jquery. Of course you could use jquery to update/replace the dom with the result.
[08:57:39] <letsgojuno> hey, can anyone help with this? it's not a specific coding problem. I'm just not sure the best way to approach it http://jsfiddle.net/27gbk/2/
[08:57:52] <letsgojuno> I need a way to avoid the flickering while hovering
[08:58:07] <zmoazeni> Pfeifakopf: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".replace(/(the)/, '<span>$1</span>')
[08:58:39] <zmoazeni> Pfeifakopf: Doh, almost: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".replace(/(the)/g, '<span>$1</span>')
[09:02:57] <Pfeifakopf> zmoazeni: thx for the help. i tried this, but it doesn't work: $(".text").html().replace(/(wurster medien)/g, '<span>$1</span>')
[09:03:28] <lessless> people, $(location).attr('pathname') gives me an page name like index.php, but how is it possible to get full url, with parameters like index.php?id=0
[09:03:35] <cloudgroup> has anyone had experience building a mobile app with jQuery mobile?
[09:05:21] <zmoazeni> Pfeifakopf: I think that just creates a new string with your replacement. You may need to save that to a var and replace the html(). var s = ....; $('.text').html(s) ?
[09:08:28] <z1000> anyone worked with or even know what this is? chili-1.7.pack.js
[09:08:34] <z1000> http://malsup.github.com/chili-1.7.pack.js
[09:08:55] <z1000> found it on this demo http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html but not sure what it is exactly, any info would be great. google didnt seem to have anything good really.
[09:09:43] <lessless> and why alert($(location).attr('href'.substring(4))); do no work ?
[09:10:52] <indro> hi all
[09:11:03] <indro> i want to select the text when i click in a text input.
[09:11:15] <indro>  <input type="text" onclick="javascript:this.focus();" >
[09:11:21] <indro> any idea why that doesnt work?
[09:12:02] <djQuery> indro: isnt it allready focused when they click on it?
[09:12:10] <blindMoe> yeap
[09:12:29] <indro> hm but the text is not selected
[09:12:33] <indro> any idea how to do that?
[09:12:54] <djQuery> indro: $('input[type="text"]').focus(function(){this.select();})
[09:13:14] <indro> nice, thanks. :)
[09:14:50] <ikla> if I'm in an <input how do I grab the name assign to that input?
[09:14:53] <ikla> this.???
[09:14:58] <barraponto> I'm trying to use Jquery Ui tabs, but do i need to follow the markup given as example in http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ ?
[09:15:25] <barraponto> i was using html5 for this website, each section is a <section> and the tabs were inside a <nav>
[09:16:38] <djQuery> barraponto: dont think tabs has any options to change what the selectors are for the linking elements
[09:17:14] <^zoggy^> so whats the proper way to have the jquery ui autocomplete bold the searching term in the results?
[09:17:24] <barraponto> djQuery: what does it expect, precisely? a span? a li?
[09:18:03] <^zoggy^> i see, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox does what i want.. just cant figure out how to pull out the matching/bolding part to apply it with a json source
[09:19:35] <djQuery> <div id="tabscontainer"><ul id="tablist"><li><a href="#idoftabcontent">tablabel<a></li></ul><div id="idoftabcontent>this will appear in tab</div></div>
[09:19:45] <djQuery> barraponto: ^^^^^^^^
[09:20:05] <barraponto> djQuery: it expects all of that?
[09:20:47] <djQuery> barraponto: so is asking for a list of the tabs and what they point to too much for you?
[09:20:57] <djQuery> didnt think it was askin much realy
[09:21:37] <barraponto> djQuery: it probably means i'll have to try <nav><ul><li><a hre="#whatever"> instead of <nav><a> (what i was doing.
[09:22:23] <barraponto> djQuery: i am trying to read the source code to see where it builds the selector, i might try hacking/patching it for my use case.
[09:22:26] <barraponto> djQuery: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js
[09:22:49] <djQuery> barraponto: ?source ui.tabs

[09:24:36] <DanielG_> hello everyone! quick question: how can I set the value of several inputs from their respectives name attributes?
[09:24:52] <z1000> trying to setup this cycle plugin instance: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html >> at >. http://p7dev.com/nj/news2 any ideas why thumbnails dont generate or line up?
[09:25:38] <blindMoe> z1000:  because the src of the thumb image is set to 'undefined'
[09:25:51] <z1000> ya but its supposed to be auto generated
[09:25:56] <DanielG_> I guess it has to be something arount $(this) but I can't figure out how to do it :(
[09:26:13] <z1000> blindMoe, http://pastie.org/2096634
[09:26:58] <blindMoe> z1000: the answer is in the error console
[09:27:00] <djQuery> DanielG_:    var x = {"fname": "bob", "lname": "mckenzie"}   $('form :input[name]').each(function(i,elm){   if(x[this.name]){ this.value=x[this.name]; }  });
[09:27:16] <djQuery> DanielG_: that will give you a start I gues.
[09:27:16] <z1000> blindMoe, is it?
[09:27:27] <blindMoe> it is in mine
[09:27:28] <z1000> I get no errors
[09:27:30] <lathan> z1000, yah, "zero elements found by selector"
[09:27:31] <z1000> please paste for me
[09:27:46] <lathan> "[cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector    cycle.js line 13"
[09:28:02] <lathan> z1000, where is you .cycle call
[09:28:06] <lathan> *your
[09:28:11] <Bodu> http://pastebin.com/QLpb3RuY : test.html contains the input. but the input doesnt hide. why?
[09:28:11] <z1000> footer
[09:28:37] <z1000> if you guys can help me figure this out, that would be awesome
[09:28:44] <DanielG_> djQuery: ohh I see. thanks a lot! :D
[09:29:18] <djQuery> DanielG_: or you might try see ?tmpl
[09:29:19] <bot-t> DanielG_, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[09:29:26] <z1000> gonna add the newest version maybe will fix
[09:29:29] <lathan> z1000, I believe the selector you give cycle is supposed to be a list of images
[09:30:03] <lathan> z1000, $('#entry-show img').....cycle(....)   (in p7.js)
[09:30:33] <z1000> no lathan doesnt work but let me check the demo more closely
[09:30:52] <thx1138_> crazy nickserv
[09:30:55] <lathan> z1000, that's also mixed with the fact that you have undefined as your imag srcs
[09:31:08] <z1000> lathan, you dont get it
[09:31:08] <lathan> Hi
[09:31:14] <z1000> entry-nav is dynamic
[09:31:19] <z1000> doesnt even exist in the html
[09:31:41] <lathan> z1000, well, where's the code to generate it? that's where your first problem is
[09:31:43] <z1000> its auto generate... I get ur point on feeding an image list so I will check that further
[09:31:53] <z1000> lol its in p7.js at the top
[09:31:58] <z1000>   pagerAnchorBuilder: function(idx, slide) {
[09:31:58] <z1000>         return '<li><a href="#"><img src="' + slide.src + '" width="134" alt="" /></a></li>';
[09:31:58] <z1000>     }
[09:33:12] <z1000> yep you're right thanks lathan
[09:33:22] <z1000> it needed the img source list without <li> wrapper
[09:33:37] <lathan> ?np @ z1000
[09:33:37] <bot-t> z1000, No Problem
[09:34:16] <z1000> u know if theres a way to still use an LI wrapper
[09:34:42] <lathan> doesn't cycle format it itself?
[09:34:48] <DanielG_> djQuery, bot-t: this is how I did it: $('input').each(function(i,elm){this.value=this.name;});
[09:34:56] <z1000> yea but cleaner if I can use an li but its fine
[09:34:57] <lathan> ?bot @ DanielG_
[09:34:58] <bot-t> DanielG_, sentient but living in the machine locale.
[09:35:27] <lathan> z1000, you might try a selector like '#entry-show img'
[09:35:33] <lathan> ?tias @ z1000
[09:35:34] <bot-t> z1000, Try It And See
[09:35:44] <lathan> DanielG_, Bot-t is a bot
[09:35:52] <DanielG_> hahaha I see :P
[09:35:54] <DanielG_> sorry
[09:35:57] <lathan> ?np
[09:35:57] <bot-t> No Problem
[09:36:00] <djQuery> DanielG_:   <input type="email" placeholder="Your email address" name="email" required  />
[09:36:36] <ikla> $('select:[name=drop]').val('test12');  is that right to change a value of a drop down?
[09:37:29] <lathan> no : in front of the [name @ ikla
[09:37:37] <lathan> no
[09:37:48] <lathan> ^ignore that last no
[09:38:14] <lathan> ikla, $('select[name=drop]').val('test123') would work. would be better if you put an id on the select field
[09:38:31] <djQuery> ikla: $('select:[name="drop"]').val('test12');  notice that "drop" needs to be in "
[09:38:38] <lathan> djQuery, no

[10:11:24] <BlackAnt> yeah bro Im cool
[10:11:25] <BlackAnt> :D
[10:11:40] <lathan> djQuery, why the "var x = "
[10:11:45] <Bodu> if i load content with #test object. it will not hide if $('#test').hide(); is written in code.
[10:12:01] <lathan> Bodu, you can't hide $('#test') before $('#test') is loaded into the page
[10:12:06] <BlackAnt> the client side thing is always the beloved thing
[10:12:11] <djQuery> lathan: so that I didnt have to do $('div.content') again in the success function

[10:12:51] <lathan> djQuery, my first glance thought that you were trying to save the xhr element
[10:14:25] <ikla> $('select:[name=test12].val('1'); works but it doesn't change the option drop down to that selection. How do I change the drop down top show a different option?

[10:16:34] <littulb> lathan - it'll only clone dropdown boxes if referenced by an attribute ...and not by "select"....wow
[10:16:52] <lathan> example?
[10:16:52] <littulb> lathan... and when i say clone i mean clone their values
[10:16:57] <djQuery> BlackAnt: by setting a timer on the hover of the items in the menu and then checking to see if the item is still hovered when the timer is done. then displaying the other items
[10:17:19] <BlackAnt> djQuery ok.
[10:17:31] <Bodu> djQuery:i can solve this problem if i write .load(url,function(){$('#test').hide();}) but when my url is: thisurl = site_url('index.php/location/create/'+ whattocreate +'/1/') + (+new Date); it doesnt work anymore.

[10:26:25] <Dev0n> hey, are there any major changes I should be aware of when going fomr jquery 1.4 to 1.6 ?
[10:26:29] <ikla> basically resetting it back to 0 or 1 when something else changes
[10:26:42] <lathan> you mean doing that on a change event?

[10:33:49] <lathan> trevatwork, do you know that that doesn't work?
[10:34:01] <BlackAnt> I love u <3
[10:34:10] <trevatwork> lathan: I'm getting the impression that it doesn't -- hard to see how JS would let it
[10:34:20] <trevatwork> but I thought I'd ask in here in case I'm missing something
[10:34:25] <lathan> why wouldn't it? its not class based
[10:34:33] <lathan> if $ is the global jQuery object
[10:34:44] <lathan> then everything inside it is also global
[10:34:48] <tbranyen> trevatwork: just need to make sure you set corporation is an object
[10:35:04] <trevatwork> lathan: I've tried setting $.corporation to an empty object literal in my globally included file
[10:35:07] <tbranyen> although i dunno why you are adding that to jQuery... but i'm sure you have your reasons
[10:35:18] <tbranyen> trevatwork: well you need to do $.corporation = $.corporation || {};
[10:35:25] <tbranyen> otherwise each file with override eachother
[10:35:28] <lathan> tbranyen, plugin authoring?
[10:35:40] <tbranyen> lathan: which is why i said what i said

[10:36:48] <trevatwork> i.e. I want whats in that final set of braces to ALSO be in there
[10:37:32] <lathan> ?extend @ trevatwork

[10:38:10] <abjorn> being sick is no fun :<
[10:38:14] <djQuery>  var this.corp = $.corporation || {}, corp = this.corp, corp.test = fucntion(){ do something here;}
[10:38:16] <tbranyen> trevatwork: actually that would work just fine
[10:38:21] <BlackAnt> that was cool bruv @ djQuery
[10:38:23] <tbranyen> what i pasted you
[10:38:32] <Bodu> http://pastebin.com/K4AbH6eJ I tried now over 3 hours to make it running.... still not.
[10:38:48] <tbranyen> since object assignment is by reference not value
[10:39:02] <tbranyen> trevatwork: try it before calling it out ;-)
[10:39:32] <trevatwork> tbranyen: ok
[10:39:43] <tbranyen> you don't need extend for what you're trying to do
[10:39:46] <djQuery> abjorn: I would rather be sick than not fealing good. at least for me sick goes away in a few days whereas not feeling good can go on for months
[10:40:29] <abjorn> I'm not sure what "not feeling good" is supposed to refer to
[10:42:34] <BlackAnt> What makes you think fast? @ djQuery are u a geek or what
[10:43:45] <Nerdin> Hi everybody, how con i identify if a piece of html was changed by ajax and call a function?
[10:45:09] <Solow> Qhy do they use .each() here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring what's the point of using each in a plugin?
[10:45:53] <Solow> Is that if the object it's called on contains multiple elements?
[10:46:17] <djQuery> Solow: $('li').myplugin();   typicaly there are more than 1 li in a ul\ol
[10:46:33] <Solow> So that's a yes :p
[10:46:38] <Solow> Thanks :)
[10:46:39] <djQuery> Solow: yes
[10:46:42] <trevatwork> tbranyen: I think that's basically what I did by initializing $.corporation to be an empty object literal in my globally included file.  then I add things to it in the subsequent files, which is now getting me what I want
[10:47:02] <trevatwork> but I like your approach for times outside of jQuery
[10:48:00] <tbranyen> trevatwork: the approach i gave you is the approach good developers use already... i didn't make it up.  jquery uses the same approach internally i believe
[10:48:45] <tbranyen> found it used 10 times in the jquery.js built source
[10:50:23] <Dev0n> hey, anyone upgraded to qitp2 plugin yet?
[10:50:32] <Dev0n> I'm trying to use the code coverter but it isn't working for me
[10:50:41] <Dev0n> from qtip to qtip2, here http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/converter/
[10:50:41] <trevatwork> tbranyen: yes, as I said a minute ago, I'm doing conceptually the same thing.  The reason I'm initializing it in a globally included file instead of using the ||-based pattern is that I want to make it easier for people on my team to have one place to explicitly declare/see list of existing namespaces
[10:51:17] <tbranyen> trevatwork: yeah whatever works
[10:52:00] <djQuery> trevatwork: regardless if you are doing that you could still do what tbranyen was suggesting. or maybe come up witha  standard for your team to use
[10:55:43] <trevatwork> djQuery: it's true, I could still do what he's suggesting.  i might still -- comes down to how rigid I want the namespace declaration rules within the team to be I guess.  thanks to you and tbranyen for your help
[10:56:29] <djQuery> trevatwork: sorry it just sounded like you were dismissing what he was sayin
[10:56:56] <trevatwork> djQuery: no not at all -- I'm actually embarrassed that that didn't occur to me as a way of ensuring the namespace existed.
[10:57:51] <trevatwork> djQuery: but JS makes it so easy to willy-nilly declare objects, and our app already has a shitton of relatively disorganized JS written by different people w/ different opinions of how to do it, so I was hoping to figure out something that would help provide some rules for the team too
[10:59:44] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: u there?
[11:04:24] <djQuery> MoTiOnXml: think he is typicaly here late

[11:20:49] <quackquack> using jQuery UI draggable, is it possible to only drag a copy of the element?
[11:26:11] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know of any firefox issues with loading images? I have a simple, straightforward img element that just won't load in firefox--It loads in every other browser just fine and it loads if I put the address of the image alone in the address bar.

[11:29:44] <Snugug> Is there a way using jQuery w/o plugins to determine what operating system a user is viewing with? Specifically trying to see if the user is viewing a page using XP
[11:30:49] <Whirl3d> http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2009/07/04/jquery-os-detection/
[11:30:57] <Whirl3d> maybe?
[11:31:04] <timmywil> Snugug: see window.navigator.userAgent
[11:31:15] <miketaylr> why do you care about OS?
[11:31:43] <miketaylr> "The interesting part here is that I didnât find a jQuery specific OS detecting plugin." because it's retarded, maybe
[11:31:49] <Snugug> Trying to direct users on XP and old browsers to upgrade, but they don't have access to IE9 so I want to make relevant suggestions to them
[11:31:55] <Whirl3d> maybe he's doing something IT related and needs to inventory all XP machines
[11:32:04] <miketaylr> lol
[11:32:17] <Snugug> Wasn't my idea, but I've been asked to do it
[11:32:33] <miketaylr> start parsing UA strings then
[11:32:37] <timmywil> that makes sense
[11:32:44] <JKarsrud> Snugug: upgrading OS is not something the user can choose that often, but upgrading a browser is definitely more doable
[11:32:55] <Whirl3d> miketaylr, didn't anyone tell you that "retarded" is the new "n" word, lol?
[11:33:10] <miketaylr> Whirl3d: meh
[11:33:13] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:33:15] <Snugug> JKarsrud: I know. If they're on XP, I want them to upgrade to FF/Chrome/Safari because they can't upgrade to IE9
[11:33:17] <JKarsrud> but ofc, UA sniffing is the way to go then, like miketaylr so adequately buts it
[11:33:24] <JKarsrud> buts, even :P
[11:33:27] <JKarsrud> puts*
[11:33:42] <Snugug> And I've been told I need to include IE9 for those who can upgrade to it
[11:33:43] <timmywil> miketaylr buts stuff all the time
[11:33:45] <miketaylr> i have no idea if navigator.platform is reliable
[11:33:46] <Snugug> :\
[11:34:13] <lathan_away> ?mdc navigator.platform
[11:34:14] <bot-t> lathan_away, window.navigator.platform - MDC Docs - Returns a string representing the platform of the browser. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.navigator.platform
[11:34:37] <lathan_away> it works on linux.....
[11:34:46] <Whirl3d> does anyone know if FF4 dropped the moz-opacity CSS declaration?
[11:35:00] <miketaylr> right, the question is if different IE flavors on XP lie...
[11:35:07] <djQuery> Snugug: see ?mondizer
[11:35:08] <bot-t> djQuery, Couldn't find "mondizer" in jQuery Docs.
[11:35:55] <Validator> I have a question with the built in validate function, I need to run the valdation script to make sure the feilds are in place then run another function, but when post it runs the validate then webiste moves on, anyway i can get around this ?
[11:36:15] <djQuery> Snugug: see ?modernizr
[11:36:15] <bot-t> Snugug, a feature detection javascript library that determines support for all sorts of html5 and css3 goodness. http://modernizr.com
[11:37:36] <Snugug> bot-t: I know about modernizer, not looking for feature detection, already have that. Looking to provide relevant upgrade suggestions for browsers
[11:37:44] <bot-t> Snugug, Monday, 2011-06-13 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110613.log.html
[11:38:01] <JKarsrud> Snugug: couldn't you just feature detect the shit out of that shit like for real shit?
[11:38:04] <timmywil> Whirl3d: it's not necessary for F>=3.0, so you probably don't need it at all
[11:38:04] <JKarsrud> :P
[11:38:20] <JKarsrud> Whirl3d: that's just old.
[11:38:28] <Snugug> I could feature detect the shit out of it but IE8 on XP or Vista will be the same
[11:38:31] <JKarsrud> why do you need it? Supporting Fx2 ?
[11:38:34] <Snugug> Vista can upgrade to IE9, XP can't
[11:38:54] <Whirl3d> timmywil, thanks for the reply. I need to make the body of a document 0 opacity until all the elements load (since they animate into place).
[11:38:59] <JKarsrud> Snugug: well, why not just point them to real browsers, and skip the whole IE thing?
[11:39:04] <JKarsrud> it's crap anyway
[11:39:04] <miketaylr> :)
[11:39:21] <Snugug> JKarsrud: I agree, but I've been specifically told I need to include IE9 as a chocie
[11:39:55] <djQuery> ?imabot@snugug
[11:39:56] <bot-t> snugug, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[11:40:16] <Snugug> brb
[11:40:22] <timmywil> Whirl3d: opacity will work fine, use a filter in IE
[11:40:42] <Whirl3d> timmywil, thx, I'll try it.
[11:40:51] <JKarsrud> then do so, and present the user with a list where IE9 has a note saying that it's not supported for XP, and that XP has been discontinued by MS, so they should download one of the others instead? :)
[11:41:00] <JKarsrud> That was for you Snugug
[11:41:08] <timmywil> np
[11:42:15] <Validator> After using the built-in valdator can you call a function to run after that?
[11:42:42] <BlackAnt> all for the love bross.
[11:43:05] <djQuery> Validator: built in validaor?
[11:43:43] <Validator> well mabye its not built in, but thoght it was , using $"nameoffield".validate({
[11:43:43] <Snugug> JKarsrud: I already have that text, but the majority of users who are going to be viewing this site are going to be XP lock ins
[11:44:00] <Snugug> Whatever, not a big deal, just won't bother and keep that text
[11:45:23] <djQuery> Validator: are you talking about the 'built in html5' validation of the browser or are you talking abou the plugin see ?validation
[11:45:24] <bot-t> Validator, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[11:46:14] <Validator> ah I see, so i have to stop it from posting after it runs that plugin
[11:48:19] <djQuery> $('#myform').validate().submit(function(e){  e.preventDefault(); });
[11:50:00] <aroman> Hi, I've got a div that I load some HTML from a .html page into. I use the $.load() function. However, the loaded HTML doesn't get styled with the CSS of the page that its being loaded into. Any way I can make sure it does?
[11:53:21] <Whirl3d> I hate my host, does anybody have any good suggestions for an inexpensive host?
[11:55:15] <Cygn> http://pastebin.com/qrgKW6gs <<< Hey Folks, i'm just trying around with jQuery for the first time and got some problems. I want to give me the opportunity to hide some content until somebody clicks on a "more" link, like for a blog for example. To do this, i got a class named "mehrlink" which is associated to every "more" link and my script should slide up, every content which has the same id as the link... what am i doing wrong?  http
[11:55:28] <Cygn> Sorry for posting the URI twice ;)
[12:00:30] <ingwaem> Greetings all...I'm building a flash application and would like to save some data if the browser is closed...so I have a $(window).unload() binding to a function called browserClose...is there any way of delaying closing the tab/window/browsing away until flash is finished saving?
[12:01:02] <aroman> ingwaem: i would hate you if you did that
[12:01:04] <Ontolog> I have a jQuery UI object 'sortable'. Inside the sortable elements I have an <input type="text" ... /> element. The input displays fine but i can't seem to edit the text. When I mouseover the cursor turns into the bone but i can't select anything.
[12:01:10] <aroman> can you imagine if that was possible?
[12:01:14] <falcom> right after im loading jquery dynamically. i call jQuery function. My chrome inspector report that 'jQuery is not defined'; However If i manually type it in console, it works. could this be some timing issue?
[12:01:38] <aroman> sites literally preventing you from closing a tab until it wanted it closed?
[12:01:41] <ingwaem> aroman: I hear you...it shouldn't take longer than a second to save though...and I just have to be sure that the info is saved first
[12:01:55] <aroman> long story short it's basically impossible
[12:02:04] <aroman> think about what you're asking and the potential for abuse
[12:02:37] <Ontolog> omg i just solved my problem nevermind
[12:03:03] <depex> can jquery resize a div to the height of a parent iframe?
[12:03:12] <ingwaem> aroman: Yes, understood. Thanks for your help. I kind of thought that was the case but had to be sure...I guess if flash gets the data from the server to begin with, all it needs to do is send a signal back to the server saying the session is done.
[12:07:38] <BlackAnt> I've understood the stuff with your example and the site's package @ djQuery
[12:25:35] <loucapo> hey guys, is this a good place for a quik jQ versioning question?
[12:26:21] <Queuetip> how can i make it so that a certain class doesn't get shown until after the page is completed loading?
[12:27:40] <Queuetip> my problem is i have links that are like: <a href="#">next</a> but they have a div class of jcarousel-next and jcarousel-prev but if they get clicked on before the page loads the user clicks on #
[12:27:58] <Woet> loucapo: just ask your question
[12:28:15] <Woet> Queuetip: that's quite a silly solution
[12:28:22] <Woet> why don't you fix the actual issue? :)
[12:28:34] <Queuetip> Woet: how?
[12:28:56] <Woet> Queuetip: could you put your code on jsfiddle please?
[12:29:00] <Woet> (the relevant parts)
[12:29:11] <loucapo> i am trying to figure out when the property of $.ajax got changed to allow for jsonpCallback
[12:29:16] <Queuetip> Woet: the relevant parts aside from the links and the divs are inside a minified version of jquery : /
[12:29:38] <Queuetip> Woet: which is causing grep to anger me
[12:30:14] <Woet> loucapo: http://webscripts.softpedia.com/scriptViewChangelog/jQuery-Javascript-Library-Changelog-39111.html
[12:30:25] <Queuetip> Woet: it's using jcarousel which is a jquery plugin, so i don't want to modify that directly, which is why i came up with that solution
[12:30:28] <loucapo> does anyone know? my guess is 1.4
[12:30:34] <Woet> Queuetip: why don't you beautify the JS so it's pretty again? :)
[12:30:40] <Woet> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[12:30:53] <Queuetip> Woet: so your solution is to modify the plugin itself?
[12:30:55] <loucapo> or use chrome to do it for you
[12:30:57] <loucapo> ;-)
[12:31:04] <Woet> Queuetip: i don't have a solution yet since i didn't see your code
[12:31:11] <timmywil> loucapo: probably 1.5
[12:31:17] <Queuetip> Woet: it's not my code :P it's a jquery plugin called jcarousel
[12:31:22] <mnyon> quick question; what's the best way to store an array of URLs? I was thinking of the value of a hidden field, but I don't think that will work
[12:31:31] <Woet> loucapo: "Â· .ajax() jsonp requests are not handled correctly when hitting timeout" in 1.6
[12:32:05] <timmywil> Woet: don't think that's related
[12:32:07] <loucapo> well i have 2 sites, one is 1.3 and one is 1.4 and they behave differentlyâ¦.that is one adds my custom callback name and one doesnt not (1.3)
[12:32:17] <Woet> "Â· If the user uses the jsonpCallback setting we now automatically set the dataType to âjsonpâ. #5803" in 1.5
[12:32:28] <Woet> not sure whether that's related either
[12:33:00] <geekbuntu> mnyon, i store a list of arrays in a javascript object by indice
[12:33:28] <timmywil> loucapo: which one does not?
[12:33:37] <loucapo> 1.3 doesnt put it
[12:33:41] <cirwin> loucapo: look at the jquery.jsonp plugin
[12:33:47] <cirwin> then you can use errbacks as well
[12:34:16] <loucapo> 1.4 is working as i expected it to
[12:34:21] <timmywil> cirwin: don't think that's related either
[12:34:53] <timmywil> loucapo: 1.4 did have some ajax improvements, can you upgrade the other site?
[12:34:58] <albacker> is it valid : function foo() { $.post(.... function(data) { return data; } );  ?? i have a case like this and it's not working.
[12:35:31] <mnyon> geekbuntu: Isn't an array a JS object? that's an array of arrays. I'm trying to set the object returned in an AJAX callback to an element on the page, so they can be accessed by other JS functions
[12:36:03] <loucapo> timmywil: ideally, but its a PITA uz its like 10 sites
[12:36:25] <geekbuntu> mnyon, in my case, i have php build my array, echo out each one adding an index number (++1) to each index
[12:36:43] <timmywil> loucapo: in that case, can you update the server to accept either function name?

[12:38:20] <astn> hello everybody
[12:38:28] <Solow> Is there a way to get the font-size of an element in pt or 'x-small'? anything not pt
[12:38:56] <gnarf> Solow: px only
[12:39:08] <Solow> gnarf: why? That's a bit weird
[12:39:10] <gnarf> Solow: at least cross browser
[12:39:22] <gnarf> Solow: because thats what all of the stuff calculates it to
[12:39:30] <Solow> But I've set it in pt, so shouldnt it be able to get it in pt...
[12:39:44] <gnarf> Solow: only by digging into the actual stylesheet rule
[12:39:50] <gnarf> the "computed css" will always be in px
[12:39:51] <Solow> christ
[12:39:53] <timmywil> loucapo: hmmm, then I think the best thing would be to upgrade
[12:39:56] <Solow> sorry
[12:40:04] <Solow> I didnt mean to curse, sorry.
[12:40:04] <astn> how do i cause a child div not to trigger its parent's click event?
[12:40:10] <gnarf> i dont give a fuck
[12:40:17] <gnarf> :)
[12:40:21] <loucapo> lol
[12:40:35] <Solow> So, is there any way to get the size in pt? at all? by calculating or something? I need to store the font-size, and it has to be the same size everywhere
[12:40:41] <geekbuntu> mnyon, if it helps - here is a pages i put together so you could see it working (view source for the urls) http://u1st.us/geekbuntu/
[12:41:12] <astn> anybody know?
[12:41:13] <gnarf> ?g pixels to points
[12:41:14] <bot-t> gnarf, Approximate Conversion from Points to Pixels - http://reeddesign.co.uk/test/points-pixels.html
[12:41:41] <astn> how do i cause a child div not to trigger its parent's click event?
[12:42:10] <mnyon> geekbuntu: Thanks for the page. Let me see if this helps. Thanks much
[12:42:42] <gnarf> so
[12:43:02] <gnarf> Solow: apparently definition of a point is 72/inch
[12:43:10] <loucapo> timmywil: thanks i'll see what the powers that be say
[12:43:18] <timmywil> loucapo: np
[12:43:28] <Solow> gnarf: depends on dpi though
[12:43:32] <Solow> been there...
[12:43:40] <loucapo> cannot believe they are still using 1.3 here
[12:43:43] <gnarf> Solow: you can determine that
[12:43:59] <Solow> gnarf: ah well. I'll just use the 'value' attribute on the option
[12:44:01] <JKarsrud> astn: couldn't you check the intended target of the event, and return false if it's not the child?
[12:44:04] <Solow> didnt think of that before.
[12:44:10] <JKarsrud> not sure if it'll work, but it works in my head :P
[12:44:21] <gnarf> Solow: you could determine pt -> px
[12:44:41] <gnarf> Solow: by creating a div, setting its font size to 72pt and seing how many px it reads back
[12:44:56] <Solow> gnarf: Yeah done that with html to pdf before
[12:44:59] <gnarf> its prolly gonna be 72 -> 96 tho
[12:48:29] <yan_nick> hey guys, can you help me? fly about the .items, some overlays doesn't hide http://jsfiddle.net/vnrBd/
[12:49:54] <Z3R0> why are you trying to do exactly ?
[12:50:11] <Z3R0> what*
[12:50:36] <kapowaz> I'm trying to use $().animate() on an element's background-size property, but it doesn't seem to work â anyone able to confirm if background-size is even supported for animations?
[12:50:56] <Z3R0> O.o
[12:51:20] <Z3R0> yan_nick: what are you trying to accomplish ?
[12:56:05] <pen> $('select').val()
[12:56:07] <pen> what does this return?
[12:56:11] <pen> is it a string?
[12:57:18] <Z3R0> it returns what's in the value="" of the option ?
[12:57:29] <Z3R0> I assume by 'select' you are referring to a combobox
[12:58:33] <Z3R0> <select id="select"><option value="1">First Choice</option></select> // $('#select').val(); // Returns "1"
[12:59:09] <lathan> Z3R0, yes, 1 is the value of the selected option
[12:59:21] <Z3R0> yep sure is lol
[12:59:25] <lathan> are you wanting the label of the selected value?
[12:59:41] <Z3R0> I'm not, was referring to the guy above me asking what it returned
[13:00:13] <Z3R0> I'm fairly confident it returns a string value, but any mathematic operator should treat it as an integer if say you did -1 against the result...
[13:00:26] <jmcantrell> how would i select the last item in a specific unordered list?
[13:00:42] <cirwin> $(list).last()[0];
[13:00:47] <Jayflux> ^^
[13:00:52] <Z3R0> wow sexy lol
[13:01:01] <Z3R0> that was fast cir
[13:02:43] <jmcantrell> cirwin: wouldn't that just select the last list?
[13:03:02] <pen> ok, it was an array
[13:03:04] <pen> just checked
[13:03:21] <cirwin> jmcantrell: given that response, I didn't understand your question
[13:03:28] <Z3R0> huh pen?
[13:04:07] <jmcantrell> cirwin: last item (li) in an unordered list (ul). not the last unordered list
[13:04:21] <cirwin> ah :)
[13:04:43] <cirwin> $("li:last", ul)
[13:05:44] <jmcantrell> would $('ul#foo > li:last') work?
[13:05:53] <cirwin> yes
[13:06:15] <yan_nick> Z3R0: when you leave the image the overlay should go awa
[13:06:19] <yan_nick> yaway*
[13:06:21] <yan_nick> away*
[13:06:24] <Patatouf> hello ! I would like to do a form text input but when I click on the input text field, i would have a list to select as an input select (same than google calendar to choose the time). Any idea ?

[13:08:23] <wesada> Hi all.
[13:10:42] <wesada> I have a table and I can add rows to it, and I can append a button to the end of the row for the purposes of removing the row, but I am having a great deal of difficulty removing the row. If I have a class level selector, does $(this) apply to all elements matching that class or the specific element of that class?
[13:11:37] <wesada> My button element has a class of removeRow
[13:11:38] <smplstk> wesada: do you have some example code?
[13:11:51] <lathan> wesada, $(this) is a jquery object containing the current "context". if you are in like a .each, then this would have the element your looping over
[13:11:57] <wesada> smplstk: Just a sec
[13:12:27] <lathan> ?demo @ wesada
[13:12:28] <bot-t> wesada, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:12:35] <lathan> go jsfiddle!
[13:17:14] <smplstk> wesada: something as simple as this should suffice: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/m7WQJ/
[13:17:36] <wesada> http://jsfiddle.net/vnm2p/
[13:17:58] <wesada> First time using JSFiddle apologies if it's not complete.
[13:18:21] <wesada> I completely forgot about closest.
[13:18:37] <wesada> I haven't used it in almost a year.
[13:19:14] <lathan> .closest = $(this).add($(this).parents)).filter(selector)
[13:19:20] <lathan> *parents()
[13:19:52] <wesada> smplstk: Thank you kindly!
[13:20:15] <smplstk> np!
[13:20:26] <wesada> lathan: Thank you too. IRC is so much better than trying to bruteforce things.
[13:20:35] <lathan> ?np
[13:20:36] <bot-t> No Problem
[13:22:34] <gnarf> lathan: you forgot the .first()
[13:22:50] <lathan> gnarf, right....
[13:23:22] <lathan> maybe there's a reason that jquery code isn't developed in an irc channel ?
[13:23:24] <lathan> lol
[13:25:21] <gnarf> lathan: I do it all the time :)
[13:25:44] <lathan> lol
[13:25:58] <lathan> I thought "find the first one that matches the selector" just didn't write that.....
[13:26:05] <lathan> wrote filter instead
[13:26:28] <Mariaa> plz anyone can check and tell me why this isn't validating http://pastie.org/2097782
[13:27:55] <Mariaa> every time i work on jquery, i am stuck
[13:27:57] <Mariaa> :/
[13:28:06] <BlaDe^> then you shouldn't be working on jquery
[13:28:35] <lathan> lol...not quite
[13:28:57] <Mariaa> i guess so
[13:29:12] <Mariaa> but  i have to sometimes
[13:29:14] <Mariaa> :/
[13:30:12] <Mariaa> can you guys see the code, i think i should place return false somewhere else too
[13:30:17] <Mariaa> but not sure where
[13:30:31] <lathan> I can't get a live demo of it as you don't have your script paths all there
[13:31:19] <limoragni> hey
[13:31:28] <Mariaa> lathan: should i give u the link to the plug in?
[13:31:46] <limoragni> my first time here....
[13:31:56] <lathan> what would be nice would be jsfiddle.net and put the absolute paths to the scripts in the left
[13:32:00] <lathan> ?demo @ Mariaa
[13:32:01] <bot-t> Mariaa, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:32:04] <lathan> ?hi @ limoragni
[13:32:05] <bot-t> limoragni, :)
[13:32:41] <Mariaa> lathan:  but jsfiddle doesn't have the validation plugin to link with the code
[13:32:47] <Mariaa> and i am working on localhot
[13:33:07] <lathan> then its going to be difficult.....
[13:33:14] <lathan> is there a public link to the validation plugin?
[13:33:17] <djQuery> Mariaa: look at add resources
[13:33:26] <limoragni> hey, do you recommend to use jQuery with google maps API 3?
[13:33:31] <lathan> djQuery, if its on localhost only that won't help a lot.....
[13:33:46] <lathan> limoragni, I recommend to use jQuery in any javascript environment
[13:33:57] <chapel> Anyone use jwysiwyg? I am trying to watch for blur/focusout events but am having no luck
[13:34:12] <gnarf> lathan: its fine, you can just point at the .js for validation via the "add resource"
[13:34:16] <Mariaa> thanks djQuery
[13:34:18] <jtannen1> I have a bunch of buttons called "btnDelete1", "btnDelete2", "btnDelete3", etc
[13:34:27] <jtannen1> in fact, there could be any number of those buttons
[13:34:28] <lathan> gnarf, I'm saying Mariaa has their plugin on their local computer
[13:34:37] <lathan> $('button')
[13:34:47] <limoragni> ok, and can you recommend me some especified documentation on Google Maps API 3 and jQuery?
[13:34:53] <jtannen1> well, there are other buttons besides thoses delete buttons
[13:34:57] <Mariaa> <script> submitform()={   $(document).ready(function(){     $("#theform").validate(); 	   });}   </script>    is this way of writing a function fine?
[13:35:05] <Mariaa> i mean the syntax is ok?
[13:35:27] <gnarf> Mariaa: no
[13:35:29] <djQuery> lathan: by plugin do you mean that is something they wrote themselves i.e. doesnt exist in the interwebs. from her response to my commnet I dont think so
[13:35:38] <lathan> idk
[13:35:46] <gnarf> Mariaa: set http://jshint.com/ if you want to know about syntax
[13:35:53] <jtannen1> when those delete buttons are pressed I'd like the tr above the closest parent tr to be deleted entirely
[13:36:00] <lathan> Mariaa, what you had before should work
[13:36:06] <jtannen1> for a particular btnDelete#
[13:36:16] <djQuery> Mariaa: think so. if you allready have it in a fiddle you can click on the jslint button
[13:36:23] <lathan> jtannen1, $('button').click(function(){ $(this).closest('tr').remove(); });
[13:36:42] <djQuery> err I ddint look at it completly
[13:36:44] <Mariaa> lathan:  ok
[13:36:57] <jtannen1> thanks, but there are other buttons besides those btnDeletes, so wouldn't that apply to those too?
[13:37:01] <Mariaa> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation#Validate_forms_like_you.27ve_never_been_validating_before.21 this is the link to the resource i am using
[13:37:25] <lathan> jtannen1, yah, you just need to alter the first selector
[13:37:40] <Mariaa> gnarf:  thanks
[13:38:11] <lathan> jtannen1, you can put a class on the delete buttons, or use the attribute-begins with to find the deletes, see ?attribute-begins-with
[13:38:12] <bot-t> jtannen1, Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[13:38:31] <lathan> *starts with
[13:39:02] <jtannen1> thanks, that'll work
[13:39:30] <chapel> anyone know how to get the blur/focusout event of an iframe?
[13:39:42] <djQuery> jtannen1: then $('tbody').delegate('button[name="delete"]', 'click', function(e){   $(this).closest('tr').remove(); e.preventDefault();});
[13:41:02] <lathan> chapel, have you tried focusin / focusout ? or hover?
[13:41:04] <Mythmon> if i make a function that animates a few different things, is there any built in way to say "ok, now undo that" ?
[13:41:08] <lathan> ?focusin @ chapel
[13:41:08] <bot-t> chapel, .focusin(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusin" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusin/
[13:41:09] <Mythmon> like if i am toggling between two states.
[13:41:23] <lathan> Mythmon, you can write a function that undoes it
[13:41:35] <Mythmon> thats what i am doing now, but I feel like there might be a better way :)
[13:41:37] <chapel> lathan: well I have, but to no avail, will see if I am doing something wrong
[13:41:39] <jtannen1> djQuery: thanks. how would I remove the closest tr parent of that closest tr, though
[13:41:45] <jtannen1> .closest('tr').closest('tr') doesn't seem to work
[13:41:46] <lathan> Mythmon, but javascript does not hold your hand to make sure you don't make a mistake
[13:41:57] <djQuery> Mythmon: have you looked at see ?toggleclass
[13:41:58] <bot-t> Mythmon, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[13:42:00] <lathan> jtannen1, is it not the tr closest to the buttons?
[13:42:16] <Mythmon> djQuery: will that work nicely with animation?
[13:42:28] <jtannen1> it's like, <tr><tr><input></input></input></tr></tr>
[13:42:34] <jtannen1> with other stuff inside the trs
[13:42:36] <djQuery> ?ui.toggle
[13:42:37] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/Effects/toggle - The enhanced toggle method optionally accepts jQuery UI advanced effects. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/toggle
[13:42:40] <jtannen1> I'd like to remove the whole thing
[13:42:47] <lathan> jtannen1, .closest doesn't work for that because it includes the current element
[13:42:53] <Mariaa> an no luck
[13:42:56] <Mariaa> once again
[13:43:04] <djQuery> jtannen1: well thats not valid html
[13:43:15] <lathan> jtannen1, either do .closest('tr').parent() or put a class on the parent tr .closest('tr.deletable')
[13:43:26] <jtannen1> alright, thanks
[13:44:17] <Mythmon> djQuery: hmm. not quite what I was looking for. thats ok though. I have a toggleOn, toggleOff function that I call that is doing the job well.
[13:44:24] <gnarf> .parents('tr:first') could work
[13:44:38] <Mythmon> I was just curious if jquery had a magic toggle animation feature :)
[13:45:35] <djQuery> Mythmon: toggle has several options that you can pass to haddle the animation
[13:45:40] <djQuery> ?toggle
[13:45:40] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/

[13:50:14] <djQuery> lublia: yes especialy if you are serving pages both in http and https   the browser will append the appropiate http(s): based on what the browser is currently using
[13:51:47] <lublia> djQuery: thank you. that's a cool feature, I did not know that.
[13:52:47] <lublia> djQuery: seems this is called "Protocol-Relative Hyperlinks", found it with your explaination
[13:54:20] <Null_> what would be the "right" method for loading pages via ajax from a page already previous loaded via ajax? IE: My menu loads page1.html's #content via .load(), and I want any links on page1.html to now also load via .load()? Do I need to re-call my original .click functions again from .load()'s callback or something?
[13:55:50] <djQuery> Null_:  see ?delegate
[13:55:50] <bot-t> Null_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[14:01:50] <electronplusplus> Hi folks
[14:02:09] <electronplusplus> I've a problem with Jquery UI tabs when I turn the cache on
[14:02:20] <electronplusplus> The content of tabs is being mixed :S
[14:04:23] <electronplusplus> any ideas ?
[14:04:43] <Raydiation> why does it run the show effect again and again when i have the mouse over the item? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/415638/
[14:06:41] <djQuery> Raydiation: see ?demo
[14:06:41] <bot-t> Raydiation, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:07:34] <Raydiation> djQuery: http://oberth-media.de/
[14:08:16] <Raydiation> do i have to check for display: none?
[14:08:29] <djQuery> Raydiation: see ?.stop
[14:08:29] <bot-t> Raydiation, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:08:36] <electronplusplus> Raydiation:  works fine here

[14:09:34] <electronplusplus> chrome @ Mac OS
[14:10:26] <electronplusplus> Raydiation: it fails if you take the mouse over the element, while it's being animated
[14:10:44] <galba> I find some regressions in 1.6.1 vs 1.5.1, known problems?
[14:11:23] <Raydiation> electronplusplus: yes, i though hover is only triggered once
[14:11:31] <gnarf> galba: why not state your issues?
[14:11:38] <gnarf> galba: .attr / .prop are way different
[14:12:10] <galba> it's in animate() but that's ui, right?
[14:12:20] <gnarf> galba: .animate() is core
[14:12:26] <gnarf> what type of issue with animate?
[14:12:26] <galba> ok
[14:13:07] <galba> gnarf: must test more before filing a bug report
[14:14:49] <ShockIt> hello
[14:14:54] <ShockIt> i'm having problems with jquery
[14:14:59] <ShockIt> i'm using this $('img[title]'
[14:15:07] <ShockIt> to match all the images in a page
[14:15:22] <djQuery> well all images that have a title anyways
[14:15:26] <ShockIt> but if the images are on a div that's on a table, they don't get shown
[14:15:35] <ShockIt> if they're free in the page they get shown
[14:15:38] <Raydiation> djQuery: hm i used $(this).children(".refdesc").stop(true, true).show("slide"); like in the docs, but it still produces the animation when i leave the mouse on the picture
[14:15:52] <electronplusplus> Shai-Tan:  $('img')
[14:16:00] <ShockIt> ok
[14:16:08] <ShockIt> i want to use img[title]
[14:16:24] <ShockIt> because only the images with a title will be shown
[14:16:42] <electronplusplus> hmm
[14:17:01] <lathan> ShockIt, that looks like it should work
[14:17:07] <lathan> can you demo it?, see ?demo
[14:17:08] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:17:16] <ShockIt> k
[14:18:19] <ShockIt> http://foolishcleverness.org/pt/press.php
[14:18:21] <ShockIt> this doesn't work
[14:18:32] <kenichi> why does jquery switch a $.post to GET when 'jsonp' and diff domain?
[14:18:41] <ShockIt> http://foolishcleverness.org/pt/test.php
[14:18:43] <djQuery> ?sop

[14:19:08] <electronplusplus> ShockIt: mouseover'
[14:19:09] <electronplusplus> ?
[14:19:15] <ShockIt> it's qTip2
[14:19:49] <electronplusplus> what do you want to do ShockIt ?
[14:19:58] <ShockIt> i'm using that plugin
[14:20:02] <ShockIt> it works on test.php
[14:20:08] <ShockIt> but not on press.php
[14:20:40] <kenichi> djQuery: that makes no mention of http verb
[14:20:42] <electronplusplus> ShockIt: strange behavior in the test page
[14:20:51] <ShockIt> yep
[14:20:53] <electronplusplus> on mouseout the text shakes
[14:21:03] <ShockIt> that verifies only in that hosting
[14:21:07] <ShockIt> in local it workss.
[14:21:36] <ShockIt> it may be godaddy
[14:21:47] <ShockIt> but let's just think about press.php
[14:21:51] <ShockIt> why doesn't it show?
[14:23:01] <Shai-Tan> hmms
[14:23:30] <ShockIt> electronplusplus, ?

[14:25:00] <ShockIt> what, really?
[14:25:04] <ShockIt> recharge the page O_o
[14:25:06] <electronplusplus> use chrome, right click -> Developers Tools
[14:25:13] <ShockIt> k
[14:25:13] <djQuery> gnarf?
[14:25:48] <ShockIt> electronplusplus, that doesn't help me now
[14:26:32] <n000b> works for me
[14:26:36] <djQuery> gnarf: what if there are 2 plugins that both impliment extend the same plugin. also they both impliment _create: funciton(){ this._super('_create');}
[14:26:57] <[Tyrant]> Can you place jquery in the head to demo in single html file, offline?
[14:27:00] <electronplusplus> ShockIt: LOL
[14:27:04] <ShockIt> ...
[14:27:12] <electronplusplus> the title is in the <a> not in the img

[14:28:26] <ShockIt> it is meant to be there too, btw
[14:28:39] <ShockIt> i'll add a title tag :D
[14:29:18] <lathan> electronplusplus, any developer console that isn't IE developer tools is better.....

[14:32:10] <ShockIt> gaicho feo :3
[14:32:50] <ShockIt> electronplusplus, it's because you're a "rodas baixas"
[14:32:51] <ShockIt> :>
[14:33:16] <kenichi> djQuery: i got it, and i feel dumb. to anyone wondering, it's because the JSONP way adds a script tag with a src attr, which of course uses a GET.
[14:33:55] <ShockIt> ok, i have another error.
[14:34:05] <ShockIt> what if i want to apply lightbox
[14:34:07] <ShockIt> to that thing?
[14:34:16] <folke_> Hi, wondering if someone could help me out. I'm pretty new too jquery. I've this code http://jsfiddle.net/zLpHq/ and it's working fine. The problem is that in the html page I'm loading there's a couple of images and therefore (I think) the slideDown() isn't smooth. I want the slideDown() too fire when the load is completed. I've googled but haven't found anything.
[14:34:30] <electronpluspl-1> ShockIt: I've never used that plugin
[14:34:36] <ShockIt> i mean
[14:34:40] <ShockIt> there's a way to avoid conflict
[14:34:54] <ShockIt> jquery builtin
[14:34:56] <wesada> Why if I have event.preventDefault() set would a click of a link still fire normally?
[14:35:19] <folke_> whoops the intendention isn't very nice, sorry for that
[14:37:18] <lathan> kenichi, jsonp's cross-browser nature requries the script tag, and the get request that insues

[14:41:10] <ShockIt> i solved this *_*

[14:45:12] <ShockIt> nope
[14:45:15] <ShockIt> i found a better way

[14:53:27] <D-Roch> Hi, I would like to create a dynamicaly growing select input, does anyone know if there is a plugin for that?

[14:53:42] <djQuery1> $('.mydiv').dialog({buttons: [{text: "OK", click: function(){}}]

[14:55:00] <D-Roch> djQuery1: i'm not sure it can be applied to a form's select input
[14:55:07] <D-Roch> djQuery1: i'm going to have a look tho thanks
[15:01:43] <d4rklit3> anyone familiar with js sdk
[15:01:44] <d4rklit3> for facebook
[15:02:11] <djquery> ?anyone@d4rklit3
[15:02:11] <bot-t> d4rklit3, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[15:03:17] <d4rklit3> lol ok.. im using fb.init({}) (no errors) then im trying to get FB.getLoginStatus()
[15:03:21] <d4rklit3> i get no response from it
[15:05:15] <d4rklit3> once again reading facebook docs is proving useless
[15:05:26] <mdpatrick> If I used javascript to add a class to some things, can I then select them using that class after a "submit" event?
[15:05:35] <mdpatrick> Or rather, how would I go about that?
[15:06:13] <blindMoe> pretty sure you could just use .addClass('className') and then use a standard selector $('.className');
[15:06:13] <djquery> mdpatrick: wel before the submit or during but not realy after unless the server puts the same class on the item
[15:06:44] <bobbobbins> so i have a dilemma...im supposed to write a function that you pass it some vars, and it returns the data back from an ajax call, but I can't figure out how to get it to work right, since $.ajax only passes the data to success, does anyone know what i can do?
[15:07:18] <d4rklit3> djquery: so you haven't used the sdk before ?  :)
[15:07:28] <djquery> bobbobbins: yep thats what the whole a in ajax is for
[15:07:57] <bobbobbins> djquery...yeah...so i just have to tell them it can't be done?
[15:08:32] <djquery> bobbobbins: no you could set it to async: false I believe
[15:08:40] <djquery> or look at deferds
[15:08:53] <bobbobbins> ok, i'll check into those, thanks
[15:08:59] <Ontolog> argh! there are so many mysterious race conditions in jQuery
[15:09:06] <mdpatrick> djquery: Yes i meant before or during.
[15:09:37] <djquery> damn lazy bot-t
[15:10:47] <MoTiOnXml> djquery: is it bad practice to initialize different widgets on the same $(element)?
[15:10:49] <mdpatrick> djquery: Ahh ok I see it works. Thanks. My error was something other than what I thought it was. lol.
[15:11:27] <djquery> mdpatrick: $('form').find('[required]').addClass('.required').end().submit(function(e){   $(this).find('.requred:')   });
[15:12:29] <djquery> MoTiOnXml: not necessarily
[15:12:38] <MoTiOnXml> djquery: allright
[15:13:02] <MoTiOnXml> djquery: just wondering about the use of .data() etc. which lives on the $(element)
[15:13:03] <gopus> theoretical question: Let us say I have a form where I can ADD fields (we'll say an upload file form). How could I get form data without necessarily having a name applied to the fields, since the name would have to be arbitrary since the user can add fields?
[15:13:13] <djquery> MoTiOnXml: $('ul').sortable().draggable()
[15:13:25] <MoTiOnXml> djquery: noted
[15:13:41] <runa> heyas. is it possible to have several JQueryUI dialogs open at the same time?
[15:14:01] <d4rklit3> how am i suppsed to use this js sdk.. if none of the documentation works?
[15:15:54] <djquery> gopus: var count = $('form:input').length;     $('.btnAddField').click(function(){  count++; $('input',{name: 'inp' + count}).appednTo('form');  });
[15:16:14] <gopus> djquery: *stares*
[15:16:27] <gopus> djquery: okay I will need to analyze that for a bit
[15:16:29] <gopus> heh
[15:17:08] <djquery> generate a name for the input on the fly. then on the server you can loop through all the post vars
[15:17:22] <gopus> okay djquery, that's more the question I think
[15:17:27] <gopus> how do I loop through the post vars?
[15:17:37] <Jayflux> djquery not seen an object in a selector before like that
[15:17:40] <gopus> does $_POST only have variables from the form in it?
[15:17:50] <gopus> I realize this is not #php, I apologize
[15:18:01] <djquery> gopus: oops messed up the object
[15:18:03] <Jayflux> yes
[15:18:13] <gopus> djquery: that's fine.
[15:18:15] <gopus> I got it.
[15:18:18] <Jayflux> it will only hold variables that were posted to that form
[15:18:20] <djquery> $('<input />',{name: 'inp' + count})
[15:18:44] <Jayflux> djquery you got documentation link for that?
[15:18:45] <gopus> JayFlux: to further burden you with PHP matters, is there a way to get the NAME of the field in _POST that has the value?
[15:18:49] <djquery> gopus: no I believe there are a lot more
[15:19:12] <djquery> ?gtfm jquery create element
[15:19:19] <djquery> damn bot-t
[15:19:28] <gopus> djquery: a lot more variables in _POST?
[15:19:30] <Jayflux> the form name gopus
[15:19:33] <Jayflux> will be the variable name
[15:19:34] <gopus> poop
[15:19:54] <Jayflux> if the form name is blah2 then $_POST('blah2') will bring you the value
[15:19:56] <gopus> Jayflux: but if I am making more form fields on the fly, I will not necessarily know the variable name?
[15:19:59] <abjorn> I told you bro. I told you about bot-t.
[15:20:17] <ezl_> when i instantiate a new Date with
[15:20:20] <Jayflux> well im assuming they will increment gopus
[15:20:22] <ezl_> new Date("2011-06-19 00:53:35.621")
[15:20:26] <ezl_> it assumes that its in my timezone
[15:20:27] <Jayflux> blah2, blah3, blah4 etc
[15:20:27] <Z3R0> oh I found a nice tutorial on that one...
[15:20:31] <ezl_> how do i tell it that its actually UTC?
[15:20:42] <mrgreenfur> quick question on using .ajax: I'm iterating through a bunch of fields and then running some ajax. How can i use my $(this) variable in my ajax success method?
[15:20:47] <Z3R0> http://www.unclecode.com/2009/09/jquery-add-new-text-fields-dynamically/
[15:20:57] <gopus> JayFlux: OOOOOOH, so like... $_POST('blah' . $fieldnumber);
[15:21:02] <gopus> thank you Z3R0
[15:21:07] <Z3R0> yes, I'm doing the same thing
[15:21:11] <Jayflux> yeah that could work
[15:21:14] <Z3R0> with things such as multiple phone numbers...
[15:22:22] <Jayflux> gopus im sure you can even make an array
[15:23:00] <Jayflux> <input type="text" name="blah[]"
[15:23:46] <jacof> hey there. Is it too much asking for a little help? I don't know much about jquery. The html structure is: <a><span></span><p></p></a> (don't worry its html5). I want to change the background picture of the <span> when hovering over the <a>. I have jquery loaded, but I have to download and load jquery.hover.js right? or does hover come integrated with jquery.js ?
[15:24:03] <gopus> JayFlux: YOU CAN!
[15:24:08] <gopus> JayFlux: I did not know one could do that.
[15:24:17] <Z3R0> do what gopus?
[15:24:24] <Z3R0> ah yes
[15:24:28] <Z3R0> name="blah[]"
[15:24:35] <Z3R0> it's in that tutorial I linked you
[15:24:42] <Z3R0> you basically create an array of ever changing content
[15:24:54] <Z3R0> and then post the entire arra
[15:24:54] <Z3R0> y
[15:25:05] <Z3R0> reference based on index
[15:25:11] <Z3R0> g2g
[15:27:29] <gopus> Z3R0: just so I understand correctly, if multiple form fields have a similar name in array form, it will all be POSTed to PHP or whatever as an array?
[15:27:50] <runa> how do I do to create a new dom element from HTML and get the object ref? something like $("body").append("<img id='foo'>"); var img=$("#foo"); but better?
[15:30:09] <ezl_> When i instantiate a new Date() object with a string "2011-06-19 00:53:35.621" -- js seems to assume that it is for the client machine's local timezone -- how can i tell it that its UTC?
[15:30:41] <runa> ezl_: explicit the timezone?
[15:31:16] <ezl_> runa: what is the format for that?
[15:33:05] <runa> ezl_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[15:36:13] <bobbobbins> so do i use that jqXHR var to get the data from my ajax call?
[15:36:56] <b0c1> how can I convert array to json string?
[15:37:06] <gnarf> ?json2
[15:37:08] <runa> bobbobbins: what's the answer HTML, XML or JSON?
[15:37:16] <bobbobbins> i have it set to xml
[15:37:28] <gnarf> b0c1: http://www.json.org/js.html
[15:37:39] <gnarf> JSON.stringify - and include json2.js
[15:37:57] <gnarf> https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[15:38:15] <bobbobbins> and im doing an alert(myvar.responseXML) to try to see the value
[15:38:31] <runa> bobbobbins: use firebug or the google chrome dev console
[15:39:10] <MoTiOnXml> can you provide an "events" argument as options when creating an element using $("<div/>")?
[15:39:24] <MoTiOnXml> i know you can do .click() etc. but i'm asking if you can do it with options
[15:39:57] <runa> MoTiOnXml: (thanks, you answered my question :)
[15:40:05] <MoTiOnXml> runa: np :)
[15:40:12] <MoTiOnXml> runa: other questions? ;)
[15:40:33] <bobbobbins> ah, even though its set to xml, it shows up in responseText
[15:40:47] <gnarf> MoTiOnXml: $("<div />", { bind: {click: fn} }); might work... so might just {click: fn}
[15:41:13] <b0c1> gnarf: jquery not have internal method?
[15:41:37] <runa> MoTiOnXml: not that I'm aware of. but keep talking, maybe I got something that I can use it in the future! :)
[15:41:50] <odyniec> doesn't .bind(events) do just that?
[15:42:15] <MoTiOnXml> gnarf: thanks, didn't see that in the docs
[15:42:17] <imsky> good evening #jquery
[15:42:26] <imsky> you scallywags
[15:42:58] <abjorn> imsky mah nigga
[15:43:05] <imsky> sup son
[15:43:11] <abjorn> sick today :<
[15:43:13] <gnarf> odyniec: yeah, bind({ click: fn, focusin: fn }) works
[15:43:13] <imsky> ?
[15:43:19] <imsky> lol really?
[15:43:22] <abjorn> yeah
[15:43:41] <jacof> what's wrong with this? 			$("h6", this).css("color", "#000')");
[15:43:45] <imsky> ah that sucks mate, get better
[15:44:03] <abjorn> thanks brah
[15:44:44] <odyniec> jacof: you're setting "color" to "#000')"
[15:44:57] <jacof> so ? #000000 ?
[15:45:33] <jacof> ohh
[15:45:35] <jacof> :P
[15:45:36] <odyniec> jacof: no, just lose the ')
[15:45:57] <jacof> thnks
[15:49:40] <imsky> abjorn: you hit up work today?
[15:50:14] <abjorn> no, I stayed home so I wouldn't get anyone sick
[15:50:16] <abjorn> went to the doctor
[15:50:46] <imsky> shiiiiiiii
[15:52:43] <jacof> allright hope this is not another stupid question. when i hover over an element, i'm changing its css properties via jquery. when i click, i go to another page. and if I hit return, the element has the properties set like if it was being hovered. because it was the last dom setting that the browser had. how can i avoid this ?
[15:52:56] <vacho> ajpiano, u are funny
[15:53:03] <jacof> "return" = "back"
[15:53:31] <SeanJM> jacof: a hover off event?
[15:53:43] <SeanJM> jacof: do you have a hover off event, rather
[15:54:03] <SeanJM> I am also getting an error, which is why I came here: Uncaught TypeError: Object .sub-category .list .container has no method 'hover'
[15:54:08] <jacof> SeanJM: hover off works fine. but if i click the element, and the mouse hasn't left the area, then the browser "remembers" the element just like if it was hovered all the time. am i explaining this correctly ?
[15:54:26] <SeanJM> I get what you are saying, what kind of element is it?
[15:54:55] <SeanJM> you could just reset it to the look you want using $(function() { }); in the begining of your code
[15:54:57] <jacof> it's an <a><span></span><p></p></a> (html5). hovering over the a changes the properties of all the elements underneath
[15:55:54] <jacof> so i just put the changes i want so i reset them, using a $(function() { }); just that? lets see
[15:56:00] <SeanJM> yeah
[15:56:32] <imsky> jacof, take a look at the following: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1195440/ajax-back-button-and-dom-updates/1195934#1195934
[15:57:06] <jacof> SeanJM: doesn't work.. seems like the browser just uses the cache version of the last state of events
[15:57:13] <jacof> imsky: reading. thanks
[15:57:41] <SeanJM> anyone ever run into this: Uncaught TypeError: Object .sub-category .list .container has no method 'hover'
[15:57:46] <SeanJM> ?
[15:58:10] <imsky> SeanJM: that looks like bad code to me
[15:58:43] <SeanJM> imsky: you are right, I just fixed it. Thanks!
[15:58:44] <odyniec> SeanJM: aren't you calling .hover on a string, by any chance?
[15:58:48] <jacof> imsky: seems like that is all the way around. that guy wants the browser NOT To save the latest event in the cache, whereas i want the browser to forget it, or to force the reload of the page.
[15:59:08] <SeanJM> odyniec: it was bad code, end of the day error
[15:59:20] <imsky> jacof, how is that different than what you want?
[15:59:41] <jacof> imsky: yeah, i read it and realized that hahah soryr
[16:01:27] <jacof> imsky: what i meant is: this guy is saying that the browser automatically loses all the changes in the dom after going "back" in history. but I'm seeing the whole opposite behavior. the browser is just saving the last dom configuration and i don't want it to
[16:02:48] <imsky> jacof, all right. take a look at http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[16:03:01] <imsky> i think you can piece together what needs to be done with that
[16:03:37] <jacof> yeah that's more like it. $(window).unload() and put inside the css neede for restoring my elements.
[16:04:58] <imsky> right
[16:05:03] <jacof> worked perfectly thanks a lot
[16:05:08] <imsky> yw jacof
[16:07:40] <Funhouse> How do I get the amount of pixels the windows is from the top of the page?
[16:09:02] <cirwin> jQuery(window).scrollTop()
[16:09:08] <SoftLight> helllo
[16:09:19] <SoftLight> is there any irc client done in jquery ?
[16:10:14] <imsky> i wish
[16:10:30] <Funhouse> cirwin, thank you
[16:10:34] <imsky> you'd still need some sort of bridge between the browser and the server, unfortunately
[16:10:34] <SoftLight> :(
[16:10:48] <bobbobbins> can someone check this out...im returning a value from getData, but its coming back undefined: http://jsfiddle.net/Xc4ut/
[16:10:52] <SoftLight> ok but jquery mobined with flash / ajax what ever
[16:10:59] <SoftLight> but without cgi-bin and javascript
[16:11:09] <imsky> ...well flash would work, that's the bridge you're looking for
[16:11:18] <imsky> so would ajax, but it'll need a connection
[16:11:20] <SoftLight> I need something that will not put my user to install any aditional program
[16:11:28] <imsky> sorry, no such thing exists yet
[16:11:32] <imsky> you can try qwebirc
[16:11:37] <imsky> that requires a python bridge
[16:11:42] <bobbobbins> the last line is where i try to use alert to show the value
[16:12:31] <SoftLight> yeah
[16:12:35] <SoftLight> I already did that
[16:12:35] <SoftLight> :)
[16:12:55] <SoftLight> I'm searching google for 3 hours :P
[16:13:44] <imsky> well websockets would have done this for you
[16:13:55] <imsky> but...not really decent support these days
[16:14:25] <gnarf> irccloud
[16:15:05] <imsky> lol
[16:15:10] <imsky> why not say mibbit then
[16:16:08] <imsky> at least with mibbit you don't have to pay $17 a month to access the world of irc
[16:18:05] <abjorn> hmm, my couchdb lib seems to be working great in node :>
[16:18:59] <imsky> have you pitched it to the hackernews crowd yet?
[16:19:08] <abjorn> nah
[16:19:51] <abjorn> maybe I'll try to publicize it a bit when it's better tested, and more complete.
[16:19:59] <abjorn> I haven't tested it in the browser yet
[16:23:25] <Patatouf> uf
[16:24:23] <byteme_> http://www.jsonlee.com/AreasOfPractice.aspx  do I need a separate IE css file to get this jquery stuff to look the same...text is large in IE
[16:25:26] <Patatouf> hi again ! i have a little problem with the .load function. I load a div. After loading, the div doesnt change but when I watch the source code of the page, the div has been refreshed. Any idea ?
[16:27:01] <coldhead> gday munters
[16:27:25] <abjorn> hey coldie
[16:31:15] <heedly> Hi, is it possible to change the color of a section of the slider in jquery ui?
[16:31:45] <heedly> like I want to have in and out points, and everything between those points would be dark grey.
[16:32:54] <imsky> you mean
[16:33:04] <imsky> <xzibit>a slider within a slider</xzibit>
[16:33:06] <imsky> ?
[16:33:20] <heedly> hmm, I guess.
[16:33:34] <heedly> but the internal slider wouldn't need to slide around
[16:33:44] <imsky> so why can't you do it with css?
[16:33:48] <heedly> I' just need to color it.
[16:33:53] <heedly> no idea how too
[16:34:43] <imsky> hit up #css then
[16:38:43] <jsnmtth> Hi, I'm having a simple problem that I don't know how to solve.  I have an element I want to match <a class="classone classtwo">, when I write my jquery match "$('a.classtwo').dostuff();", It never matches the element.  Does anybody know how to match html classes with jquery in this fassion?
[16:39:24] <abjorn> ?js NaN != NaN
[16:39:26] <bot-t> abjorn: true
[16:39:28] <abjorn> :3
[16:40:17] <imsky> lololol
[16:40:19] <cirwin> abjorn: it's so that 1/0 != -1/0 :p
[16:40:39] <coldhead> hahahahhaha cirwin++
[16:41:00] <cirwin> or -0/0 evne
[16:41:04] <cirwin> -1/0 is -Infinity
[16:41:16] <abjorn> ?js 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3
[16:41:18] <bot-t> abjorn: false

[16:41:37] <imsky> lolol
[16:41:39] <cirwin> :)
[16:41:42] <imsky> this stuff goes back...decades
[16:41:43] <abjorn> nah, just the IEEE standard
[16:41:46] <cirwin> equality of floats IS NOT DEFINED
[16:41:54] <abjorn> if they used a different floating point standard it wouldn't be a problem
[16:42:04] <cirwin> you need to do all that rubbish with Math.abs and subtraction and error-bars and stuff
[16:42:15] <imsky> that's why the bros at netscape invented math.round
[16:42:24] <cirwin> abjorn: au contraire, there would be a different problem but no one would understand it
[16:42:28] <ryanneufeld> ?js (0.1 * 100000 + 0.2 * 100000)/100000
[16:42:29] <cirwin> at least there's only one
[16:42:31] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: 0.3
[16:42:55] <ryanneufeld> ?js 0.01+0.02
[16:42:58] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: 0.03
[16:43:05] <ryanneufeld> well, that's all kindsa fucked
[16:43:05] <abjorn> cirwin: lol I guess it depends on which one. Not all standards are built equally :p
[16:43:08] <imsky> wut is going on
[16:43:20] <ryanneufeld> imsky: seakipps
[16:43:20] * imsky eats sushi
[16:43:26] <imsky> lolol
[16:43:36] <cirwin> abjorn: you can't have base-2 floats and expect base-10 arithmetic to work .full stop.
[16:43:57] <abjorn> I suppose there will likely always be bugs like that. But at least they can be lessened
[16:44:14] <cirwin> abjorn: right, but there's a huge advantage to everyone using the same standard
[16:44:18] <imsky> if anybody's confused about wut's going on
[16:44:19] <snover> BCD
[16:44:20] <imsky> http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
[16:44:23] <cirwin> so using a different standard would be a step backwrod
[16:45:15] <ryanneufeld> and break all the code that has accounted for BCD float errors :p
[16:52:33] <jsnmtth> ok nevermind... I wrote a test program to explicitely test the behavior of my issue and it works as expected.  Sorry to waste everyones time :-(
[16:54:48] <ngharo> nerds
[16:55:09] <coldhead> ?hi5
[16:55:09] <bot-t> âµ
[17:00:36] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @ coldhead
[17:00:37] <bot-t> coldhead, âµ
[17:00:50] <vrtigo> hmmm
[17:01:21] <vrtigo> is this a bug? $('table tbody:nth-child(2)') returns the first tbody, when there is a thead above it
[17:01:34] <vrtigo> when the thead is moved below the tbody's, it works fine
[17:02:10] <ryanneufeld> vrtigo: does $('table').find('tbody:nth-child(2)') work?
[17:02:19] <vrtigo> one sec
[17:02:29] <abjorn> fuck I want some pasta with pesto sauce
[17:02:32] <abjorn> sounds so good right now
[17:02:35] <abjorn> but idk if I can keep it down
[17:02:40] <ryanneufeld> vrtigo: also see this: http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child/5
[17:03:15] <vrtigo> no, that returns the wrong tbody also
[17:03:22] <vrtigo> weird!
[17:03:41] <cirwin> vrtigo: nth-child is not nth
[17:03:46] <ryanneufeld> vrtigo: also see this: http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child/5
[17:03:54] <ryanneufeld> nth-child is slow
[17:04:02] <cirwin> so it's anything that happens to be the second child of an element
[17:04:04] <cirwin> and also a tbody
[17:04:10] <cirwin> not the second tbody child of an element
[17:04:24] <vrtigo> hmm ok
[17:09:18] <vrtigo> $('div.nutrition table tbody').filter(':nth-child('+activeTbody+')').fadeIn();  <--- should be working
[17:09:50] <vrtigo> and by working, i mean skip the first child of the table which is a thead
[17:09:55] <vrtigo> but it isnt
[17:10:53] <djquery> vrtigo: why do you have a thead inside a tbody?
[17:11:21] <coldhead> dead twin syndrome
[17:13:06] <vrtigo> djquery: i dont
[17:13:32] <djquery> (7:09:52 PM) vrtigo: and by working, i mean skip the first child of the table which is a thead
[17:15:29] <djquery> from what u described you do. you have allready filtered it to a div with a class of nutrition grab all the tables. then grab thier tbodys.
[17:20:45] <vrtigo> .eq() works
[17:20:55] <vrtigo> using activeTbody-1
[17:21:57] <vrtigo> i should mention, im using the same activeTbody index var to fadeIn both a tbody and an image associated with it
[17:22:53] <vrtigo> with .eq(), both work... with :nth-child, the images work, the selector breaks on tbodys (with thead above them)
[17:24:44] <devians> is there any reason why $('#myform').submit(); wouldn't submit the form?
[17:25:15] <Stew_a> more or less than one #myform?
[17:25:24] <bobbobbins> so can someone tell me why my getData function returns undefined instead of a value: http://jsfiddle.net/Xc4ut/
[17:25:44] <devians> Stew_a, nope only one
[17:26:12] <djquery> devians: no action on '#myform'
[17:26:21] <djquery> method?
[17:26:26] <devians> djquery: it has an action and a method
[17:26:33] <devians> and even an enctype
[17:26:35] <devinrolsen> Hey can anyone help me wrap my brain around only allowing one ajax request at a time by aborting previous requests? http://jsfiddle.net/Lme8V/
[17:33:35] <Stew_a> i've been looking for something to help make something similar to org charts (a lot like google's org chart tools) but with the ability for nodes in the tree to have multiple parents. has anybody seen anything like this or am i going to have to build something completely from scratch
[17:40:20] <bobbobbins> i wrote a plugin, and if i do $("#mydiv").myplugin, it works, but if i do $.myplugin it says its not a function...can someone tell me what I'm doing wroing?
[17:40:35] <bobbobbins> http://jsfiddle.net/Xc4ut/1/
[17:41:10] <cirwin> bobbobbins: if you want $.spdi to work
[17:41:15] <cirwin> you have to set $.spdi = function ()
[17:41:20] <cirwin> not $.fn.spdi
[17:42:19] <bobbobbins> cirwin: if i do that, will $("mydiv").spdi still work?
[17:42:25] <cirwin> no
[17:42:36] <cirwin> you can set both
[17:42:43] <cirwin> but it's unusual to have them both be the same function
[17:43:52] <bobbobbins> ok, thanks
[17:44:17] <bobbobbins> it didn't work anyways...getData still returns an undefined...i thought making that change might fix it
[17:44:56] <cirwin> you have to use "return" if you want it to return..
[17:45:05] <cirwin> return $.fn.spdi.methods[method](settings);
[17:45:07] <cirwin> or return this;
[17:45:16] <cirwin> depending on if you want it to chain or not
[17:46:31] <bobbobbins> cirwin: i have a return 1; there
[17:46:41] <cirwin> you need a return in your main function too
[17:46:50] <bobbobbins> ohhh
[17:47:06] <bobbobbins> i see...got it!
[17:47:39] <coldhead> good debugging, kids
[17:48:07] <bobbobbins> aha, that worked...thanks...i'll get the hang of this yet
[17:49:57] <mattp_> is it possible to arbitrarily load an iframe with a string of html?
[17:50:26] <cirwin> <iframe src="data:HelloWorld"/>
[17:51:00] <mattp_> cirwin: what is data:?
[17:51:19] <cirwin> wikipedia? :p
[17:51:28] <cybercobra> mattp_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme
[17:51:39] <mattp_> src="data:foo bar baz<br/><p> blo</p>"/>
[17:51:53] <mattp_> ?
[17:52:01] <shesek_> mattp_, you could also create an iframe to about:blank and document.write() into it
[17:52:08] <abjorn> (â¯âµÐâ²)â¯å½¡â»ââ»)ï¾Ðï¾)å½¡â
[17:52:09] <ryanseddon> do data:text/html,<iframe src="http://google.com"></iframe>
[17:52:10] <shesek_> there's a length limit on data: URIs
[17:52:29] <mattp_> shesek_: ah cool. that makes sense :) thanks all
[17:56:38] <cybercobra> any insight on this obtuse Mozilla JS error I'm getting?: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument"  nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)"  location: "JS frame :: jquery.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 7328"  data: no]
[17:57:38] <ryanseddon> probably a syntax error
[17:57:48] <cybercobra> line 7328: value = jQuery.isFunction( value ) ? value() : value;
[17:59:05] <mattp_> shesek_: im doing this iframe id="preview_iframe" src="about:blank" width="584px"></iframe>, is this correct? It seems to be auto opening a new window
[17:59:10] <ryanseddon> you're probably parsing some malformed code into jQuery which is causing it to die, check you're not missing semi-colons or have traling commas etc
[17:59:48] <shesek_> mattp_, what do you mean? it opens the iframe in a popup?
[18:00:15] <mattp_> shesek_: yes
[18:00:36] <shesek_> that doesn't make much sense... can you pastebin your code?
[18:00:47] <mattp_> shesek_: er sorry nevermind, its code elsewhere doing it :)
[18:00:53] <cybercobra> ryanseddon: then why wouldn't it report a compile-time error as usually does?
[18:00:55] <mattp_> thanks for the help!
[18:01:12] <ColKurtz> mattp_ why are you creating an iframe with about:blank ?
[18:01:26] <cybercobra> *as it
[18:01:35] <ryanseddon> I don't know it's hard to so with little information you're giving to the context of your problem
[18:01:39] <mattp_> ColKurtz: so i can flil it with html from an ajax call in doc ready
[18:02:07] <ColKurtz> why not just insert a new DOM node?
[18:02:17] <cybercobra> ryanseddon: well, the error has no stack trace
[18:02:19] <ryanseddon> attach a break point to your code and step through it
[18:02:20] <ColKurtz> like a <div>
[18:03:09] <mattp_> ColKurtz: its an html preview sort of thing, i cant have existing style sheets being applied to what im displayin
[18:03:32] <ColKurtz> oh, I see
[18:05:09] <cybercobra> ryanseddon: http://jsfiddle.net/MbY6P/
[18:17:54] <abjorn> http://goo.gl/9YCuV you will never be this awesome
[18:19:06] <ryanseddon> cybercobra: why are you creating custom elements?
[18:21:38] <cybercobra> ryanseddon: server wants XML
[18:22:55] <ryanseddon> cybercobra: it's hard to say with that snippet, your best bet would be to step through the code and see where it breaks

[19:19:16] <glaksmono> I added a live('click') event listener to a button, and attached a get request on the callback function, could anyone explain why is the get request sent multiple times? (i.e. it seems like the click button is triggered multiple times)

[19:23:34] <sacrebleu> what is .load?
[19:25:01] <djquery> glaksmono: well good look then. too bad you couldnt break it down into a snippet instead of having to link the whole thing

[19:37:42] <blackthorne> hi
[19:37:54] <blackthorne> can't center a jquery-ui dialog
[19:38:06] <blackthorne> how should I do it?
[19:38:28] <blackthorne> am I supposed to dig threw the minimized code and change it?
[19:38:49] <glaksmono> how do you make sure that live is only assigned to an object once?
[19:38:55] <glaksmono> live('click' i meant
[19:39:22] <sacrebleu> djquery: well, firebug reports the response correctly.
[19:40:25] <sacrebleu> alert(data) shows the right response.
[19:40:41] <sacrebleu> which was: <img src="tmp/thumbnail7anUMS.jpg" height="320" width="240 border=1>
[19:41:01] <djquery> sacrebleu: -10 geekpoints for admiting to using alert
[19:41:19] <sacrebleu> I really don't care: nopersoncommittee.org
[19:45:36] <sacrebleu> djquery:  It goes --> request new thumbnail --> php goes "generating, waiting to be generated" ... php then gets info from the file (getimagesize) and returns a tempfile by the same name to jquery via ajax.  ajax then sticks it in the dom (but the element is empty)
[19:46:08] <djquery> well does the url for the tmp file work/
[19:46:13] <sacrebleu> yes
[19:46:30] <sacrebleu> try it yourself http://gudagi.com/tmp/thumbnailv6YVzj.jpg
[19:48:34] <Null_> modified your suggestion slightly, so I have the original behaviour I had with .live().  Still same result on the links from the external page though.  Is it something with how I'm handling the hashes? http://jsfiddle.net/Hmxjn/1/
[19:52:25] <gopus> is there a common practice for making it so that jquery ajax .posts don't reveal too many secret files that you don't want shown?
[19:57:08] <ridethefire122> is anyone in here intimately familiar with jplayer? If so, can someone explain how the player knows which media to load?
[20:14:00] <heatxsink> does anyone know a way of using $.getScript and also putting an id attribute on the injected script tag?
[20:23:53] <magcius> does anybody know why slideDown() looks incorrect when you have padding?
[20:27:46] <heatxsink> magcius: do you have an example?
[20:27:49] <amereservant_> Is it not valid to do this?  $.myFunction = function(myvar=false) { ...
[20:27:59] <cirwin> amereservant_: no
[20:28:10] <amereservant_> cirwin, How do you do that then?
[20:28:17] <cirwin> but it's optional to miss out arguments when calling a function
[20:28:29] <cirwin> so you can do (function foo (myvar) {}); and foo();
[20:28:46] <amereservant_> cirwin, Oh, ok, so the variable doesn't have to be passed to the function?
[20:28:49] <cirwin> yup
[20:29:07] <amereservant_> cirwin, Thanks.  I'm use to PHP on that one....
[20:29:11] <cirwin> you will often see things like if(!options) { options = {}; }
[20:29:19] <cirwin> or options = $.extend({}, options;
[20:29:30] <amereservant_> cirwin, Gotcha.  Thank you very much.
[20:30:39] <magcius> heatxsink, I'm creating one now
[20:30:47] <heatxsink> magcius: sweet
[20:40:20] <magcius> heatxsink, hm, I can't seem to reproduce on a smaller example
[20:40:28] <heatxsink> weird....
[20:40:44] * magcius tries something else
[20:40:50] <heatxsink> magcius: nice
[20:48:32] <magcius> heatxsink, OK, this is the oddest thing.
[20:48:46] <sacrebleu> ITS CRAP
[20:51:31] <magcius> OK, it's somehow related to the container div.
[20:58:46] <coldhead> falcom PUNNNNNNNNCH
[20:59:00] <magcius> heatxsink, OK, http://jsfiddle.net/UUavx/
[20:59:44] <magcius> hit the giant button
[21:01:16] <balr0g> magcius, so what?
[21:01:37] <magcius> balr0g, notice how the element expands to twice its original size before "collapsing" to its real size
[21:01:52] <magcius> well, this is FF4. Could this be browser-specific?
[21:02:28] <balr0g> magcius, using Chrome12, also can see it
[21:02:35] <magcius> OK.
[21:03:08] <magcius> So... is this a bug in jQuery?
[21:04:31] <coldhead> jQuery has no bugs
[21:06:59] <Greed> Anyone care to tell me why this return false; isn't working?
[21:07:01] <Greed> http://pastie.org/2099621
[21:07:37] <magcius> Greed, $("submit")
[21:07:42] <magcius> do you have a <submit> tag?
[21:08:50] * Greed facepalms
[21:08:53] <Greed> Thanks, magcius
[21:10:31] <cirwin> is there a way to prevent the blur that occurs when the user types escape?
[21:17:11] <balr0g> magcius, dont know what happens, i tried toggle and ocuurs the same thing: http://jsfiddle.net/8Gku2/3/
[21:17:11] <magcius> heatxsink, ?
[21:17:33] <magcius> balr0g, so it's a jQuery bug?
[21:17:40] * magcius can't believe it hasn't been reported before.
[21:18:00] <danheberden> what occurs?
[21:18:13] <magcius> <magcius> balr0g, notice how the element expands to twice its original size before "collapsing" to its real size
[21:18:26] <danheberden> that's not a bug, that's the element becoming a block level element
[21:18:37] <magcius> http://jsfiddle.net/UUavx/ is the original fiddle
[21:18:49] <magcius> danheberden, <div> is already a block-level element?
[21:19:05] <ryanneufeld> unless it's got a style display:inline set
[21:19:12] <magcius> wihch it doesn't
[21:19:23] <magcius> unless 960.gs did something extremely stupid
[21:19:44] <ryanneufeld> it floats it
[21:19:52] <ryanneufeld> which can change it, but it shouldn't
[21:20:01] <danheberden> i've always had issues with that and elements with padding
[21:20:02] <magcius> for container_12?
[21:20:15] <magcius> OK, so jQuery is completely useless for decent animation. Good to konw.
[21:20:26] <danheberden> that's an overgeneralization
[21:20:40] <danheberden> but ya, you should be using css3 transforms :)
[21:20:49] <magcius> I think you mean transitions?
[21:21:05] <magcius> seriously, how hard is it for jQuery to work
[21:21:10] <magcius> That's really all I ask for.
[21:21:32] <ryanneufeld> magcius: you're blaming a hammer for a bent nail
[21:21:43] <magcius> Of course I am.
[21:22:08] <magcius> it's an automatic hammer, and when I tell it to hammer, it bends my nails
[21:22:14] <magcius> I can play the analogy game too!
[21:22:34] <ryanneufeld> then you're using the wrong nails for that hammer
[21:23:12] <danheberden> is it me or is the box resizing because of word wrapping
[21:23:27] <magcius> danheberden, it is!
[21:23:48] <magcius> danheberden, also, if you remove the class="container_12" from the outer <div>
[21:23:50] <magcius> that fixes it too
[21:23:56] <ridethefire122> can someone explain why the following code is broken? http://www.pastie.org/2099689
[21:24:02] <magcius> I'm curious how exactly 960 fucks it
[21:24:22] <magcius> ridethefire122, playerType isn't defined.
[21:24:34] <magcius> neither is wrapper, nor player, nor playlist
[21:24:52] <ridethefire122> magcius, yes, that's a snippet of the code right there
[21:25:01] <ridethefire122> I'll show you the whole shebang
[21:25:03] <ridethefire122> just a sec
[21:25:06] <magcius> what's the error?
[21:27:13] <aaa>        are individual plugins available to be called from ajax.googleapis.com/libs/jquery... cannot seem to call them?
[21:28:41] <ridethefire122> magcius or anyone else, why is the following code failing to play the correct track associated with "NOT DOWNLOADABLE" http://www.pastie.org/2099700 http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/content/test-title-test-article
[21:29:44] <magcius> ridethefire122, I click the play button under "Korn and Skillex - Get Up" and it works for me.
[21:30:00] <magcius> oh wait
[21:30:03] <ridethefire122> magcius: wrong player
[21:30:48] <ridethefire122> I'm thinking that it has something to do with the .each() statements, but I'm not quite sure
[21:32:00] <ryanneufeld> magcius:  taking out the class on your fiddle doesn't fix it here
[21:32:38] <magcius> oh no, it doesn't
[21:32:44] <magcius> so yeah, I guess it's word-wrapping then
[21:32:56] <ryanneufeld> yes
[21:33:05] <ryanneufeld> looks like it
[21:33:07] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[21:33:28] <ridethefire122> magcius you'll notice that cliicking "NOT DOWNLOADABLE" actually plays the media associated with the first item in the list

[21:41:11] <heatxsink> magcius: jquery bug?
[21:41:15] <ryanneufeld> ?peenmeter
[21:41:15] <magcius> heatxsink, it's a bug in jquery apparently.
[21:41:16] <bot-t> http://peenmeter.com/
[21:41:42] <abjorn> ...I...I see
[21:41:49] <heatxsink> magcius: is there a work around?
[21:42:01] <abjorn> well, sleep time for me
[21:42:02] <abjorn> night
[21:45:27] <wangdoo> why is my page refreshing.How do i prevent it?
[21:46:15] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ wangdoo
[21:46:16] <bot-t> wangdoo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[21:46:55] <dr0id> heh, wangdoo
[21:47:13] <vrtigo> ie7 seems to be having issues fading in/out tbody's
[21:47:18] <magcius> heatxsink, not that I know of.
[21:50:25] <heatxsink> magcius: balls.
[21:50:36] <magcius> heatxsink, you're my hero if you can think of one.
[21:51:30] <heatxsink> magcius: is the bug the janky re-adjusting thing?
[21:51:34] <magcius> heatxsink, yes.
[21:51:42] <magcius> heatxsink, it's apparently due to word wrapping
[21:52:12] <heatxsink> magcius: have you tried giving the outer div a height?
[21:52:19] <wangdoo> bot-t: http://fixee.org/paste/9u7o47x/
[21:52:20] <bot-t> wangdoo, Couldn't find "http://fixee.org/paste/9u7o47x/" in jQuery Docs.
[21:52:40] <magcius> heatxsink, no, because it shouldn't have one.
[21:52:48] <heatxsink> ah gotcha
[21:53:32] <ryanneufeld> wangdoo: what does your console say?
[21:53:48] <heatxsink> magcius: i think it could be fixed somehow
[21:53:54] <heatxsink> magcius: or you could fake it somehow
[21:53:55] <heatxsink> hehe
[21:53:56] <magcius> heatxsink, feel free to play with the fiddle.
[21:54:07] <wangdoo> ryanneufeld: after selecting value from first drop down ,my page is refreshing.
[21:54:10] <heatxsink> ya i was looking at it
[21:54:21] <heatxsink> i gotta move from my current location
[21:54:45] <ryanneufeld> wangdoo: you've said that three times
[21:54:50] <ryanneufeld> what does your console say?
[21:55:06] <heatxsink> brb
[21:55:46] <wangdoo> ryanneufeld: tell me how to prevent refreshing.my console does is not showing any errors
[21:56:37] <ryanneufeld> I dunno man, I've only been dong JS for a little while
[21:57:42] <ryanneufeld> wangdoo:  that code sample you put has all kinds of problems
[21:57:54] <ryanneufeld> learn how to use firebug, so you can see what the output is
[21:57:59] <ryanneufeld> I'm out for thenight
[22:01:30] <ridethefire122> Can someone explain why an <a> element is necessary for this code to "play" media? http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/content/test-title-test-article http://www.pastie.org/2099700
[22:07:01] <wangdoo> ryanneufeld: firebug is not showing errors
[22:08:50] <ridethefire122> wangdoo how about you?!
[22:21:52] <blackboard> Hey Guys
[22:23:47] <dr0id> Hey blackboard
[22:23:50] <dr0id> Where is Chalk ?
[22:23:54] <blackboard> lol
[22:23:56] <ridethefire122> hey blackboard. are you any good at jqery?
[22:24:01] <ridethefire122> *jquery
[22:24:09] <blackboard> Im pretty average tbh.
[22:24:26] <blackboard> dr0id: http://pastie.org/private/2itctsuqah14aumzr57vq - The push in that script just adds it to the end of the array, but i want to make a new 'row' in the arra
[22:27:35] <blackboard> ?
[22:32:00] <ridethefire122> duders, what does 'n' in function(n) mean?
[22:34:53] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Depends on the function...
[22:35:29] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths: in the context of this then: http://www.pastie.org/2099700
[22:36:42] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: My guess is that it's short for "node".
[22:37:51] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths is node jquery/javascript-specific terminology? I'm trying to wrap my head around why this player will only play items enclosed by <a> elements
[22:38:26] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: In DOM terms, a node is any HTML tag or piece of text inside the page.
[22:38:47] <tbranyen> or comment
[22:38:54] <dxgriffiths> Right.
[22:39:09] <dxgriffiths> Usually we only deal with elements, which is the same as saying tag.
[22:39:31] <ridethefire122> ok that makes a ton more sense now
[22:58:42] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths, still thereE?
[23:04:38] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: sure.
[23:06:32] <ridethefire122> the following line means, find li.track under .jp-playlist within wrapper, and for each instance of li.track, do the following. Is this correct?
[23:06:33] <ridethefire122> $(wrapper).find('.jp-playlist li.track').each(function(n)
[23:06:45] <ridethefire122> {
[23:07:06] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Sounds right.
[23:07:41] <ridethefire122> hm. well thanks.
[23:08:39] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Actually you'd probably have to add a contents() in there otherwise it's just going to search through the list of 1 wrapper.
[23:09:11] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: If it's not working. I forget what the scope of find() is.
[23:09:12] <ridethefire122> that is fine in this case
[23:10:06] <ridethefire122> I'm kinda pulling my hair out over what is probably a TINY thing that I'm not noting
[23:12:06] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: What's the problem?
[23:12:40] <matter> Hi Guys !
[23:13:40] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths, basically, I'm not clear on why an <a> element is necessary for this code to "play" media http://www.pastie.org/2099700
[23:14:05] <matter> I have done a small script for deleting image from a database in ajax using jquery, something weird happen : the first image is deleted properly but if I want to delete an other one I need to relaod the page...
[23:14:27] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Lemme take another look.
[23:14:33] <ridethefire122> thanks
[23:14:58] <dxgriffiths> dxgriffiths: Ok, do you see the .href there?
[23:15:19] <ridethefire122> yes
[23:16:15] <dxgriffiths> dxgriffiths: Only <a> tags have an .href, so the way it's been built is that the songs exist as links to the mp3 first, and then using this JavaScript the location of the mp3 can be extracted and played.
[23:16:27] <dxgriffiths> lol, answered myself there.
[23:16:36] <ridethefire122> :P
[23:16:44] <ridethefire122> ok
[23:17:03] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: So technically there's no real need for them to be <a> tags, it's just using the built-in property of them to have a URL.
[23:17:15] <ridethefire122> but is "this" a jquery function?
[23:17:37] <ridethefire122> or would I just want to use something like this.class for anything with a class (for instance)
[23:17:54] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: in cases like .each() `this` will refer to the HTML element currently being handled.
[23:18:43] <ridethefire122> hm. and if I'm not dealing with an html element?
[23:18:47] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: To access jQuery methods on it like .addClass you can do $(this)
[23:20:17] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Does that make sense?
[23:21:16] <djquery> ridethefire122: dxgriffiths: this is redundant. varÂ wrapperÂ =Â $(this).parent().get(0);  something only has 1 parent  varÂ wrapperÂ =Â $(this).parent()
[23:21:38] <ridethefire122> unfortunately, it doesn't. I lost you after your response at 2:17
[23:21:47] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: No problem, we can backtrack.
[23:22:18] <ridethefire122> actually, one sec
[23:23:15] <djquery> playerPlayTimeÂ =Â $(wrapper).find('.jp-play-time').get(0);  $(wrapper) is redundant as it is allready a jquery object from earlier
[23:23:19] <ridethefire122> I'm looking up attr real quuick
[23:24:42] <djquery> this is what I have cleaned up so far.
[23:24:43] <djquery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/A6Bbb/
[23:26:43] <notze> hey guys
[23:27:26] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths: can you explain exactly what $(player).attr('rel', this.href); does? I'm nost sure I understand why .attr has two values within the ()
[23:27:42] <djquery> damn how many times you gonna do $(player)??????????         var $player = $(this);   then from then on just do $player.find(
[23:27:49] <ridethefire122> scratch that, didn't read far enough down the page
[23:28:02] * dxgriffiths acknowledges djquery
[23:28:06] <ridethefire122> djquery not my code. I'm just modifying it
[23:28:17] <djquery> cool
[23:28:20] <ridethefire122> I'm also sorta using it to learn jquery
[23:28:42] <notze> i have a page which calls jquery functions ondocument.ready. but then only a certain part is reloaded via ajax. how can i recall jquery then again i dont know what event to listen on
[23:28:45] <djquery> ridethefire122: did you see how I cleaned up the var declaration?
[23:29:13] <ridethefire122> yes
[23:29:18] <djquery> notze: you mean after the ajax is done
[23:29:39] <notze> yes e.g.
[23:30:05] <notze> it is a table which shoudll have fixed header, i do this via jquery but after ajax the table is "new"
[23:30:14] <notze> and i want to rerun the jquery
[23:30:35] <djquery> $(document).ready(function(){    $.ajax({url: 'someurl.php\aspx', success: function(data){ this fires when ajax done.}}  })
[23:31:19] <djquery> notze: are u using some type of table plugin? i suggest see ?jqgrid
[23:31:21] <bot-t> notze, jqGrid - Server Side Grid | jQuery Plugins - The grid is a Ajax-enabled JavaScript control that provides solution for representing tabular data on the web. Since the grid is client-side solution and loading data dynamically through Ajax callb... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqGrid
[23:31:39] <ridethefire122> dxgriffiths: what is 'rel' in $(player).attr('rel', this.href); actually being set to?
[23:32:50] <ridethefire122> if I'm understanding 'this' in this context correctly, it will be set to 'a.href'
[23:32:55] <djquery> ridethefire122: <a rel="something" href="someurl'>  in this case something would be chagned to someurl
[23:33:18] <notze> okay thank you i will try this!
[23:33:42] <ridethefire122> djquery thanks. that makes sense
[23:34:51] <ridethefire122> djquery / dxgriffiths so then does this player use an element's 'rel' attribute to know which media element to play?
[23:38:10] <djquery> ridethefire122: the click that you are binding after the playlist.push  I would turn that into a live event
[23:38:54] <ridethefire122> djquery, what, pray tell, is a live event? :D
[23:39:22] <djquery> ridethefire122: see ?live
[23:39:23] <bot-t> ridethefire122, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[23:40:10] <djquery> ridethefire122: can you create a fiddle and put an example of the html output before the jquery runs?
[23:42:08] <ridethefire122> djquerynever used a fiddle before. I can show you an example on my test site if you'd like though
[23:42:22] <djquery> ridethefire122: sure
[23:42:38] <ridethefire122> http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/content/test-title-test-article
[23:42:50] <ridethefire122> scroll down a bit to the player
[23:42:50] <dxgriffiths> ridethefire122: Sorry for dropping out, I'm in another window building something.
[23:42:58] <ridethefire122> that's ok
[23:45:28] <djquery> ridethefire122: by the way try not to do a return false. try doing   $(this).click(function(e)Â {Â e.preventDefault();Â restÂ ofÂ code })
[23:45:55] <ridethefire122> yeah, I was going to ask about that
[23:46:02] <ridethefire122> what does return fals even mean in this case?
[23:46:51] <djquery> $("p.track").hover(function()Â {$(this).toggleClass("track_active");Â });
[23:47:15] <djquery> it means both e.preventDefault(); and e.stopPropogation();
[23:47:42] <djquery> basicaly act as if it werent clicked
[23:48:08] <gnarf> djquery: i think it also stops any other handlers bound directly after
[23:48:22] <djquery> and it should not be inside an .each
[23:48:26] <gnarf> not 100% sure
[23:50:11] <djquery> ridethefire122: oh and if you wanna make all this a lot easier http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/
[23:50:50] <djquery> ridethefire122: course you need a shim or what not to get it to work on ie
[23:52:16] <ridethefire122> djquery: do you happen to know what information the player I'm using needs in order to "play" a media file?
[23:52:49] <djquery> ridethefire122: would imagine just a link to the file I have never worked with jplayer
[23:53:10] <ridethefire122> hm
[23:53:18] <momito> goodmornin folks
[23:55:09] <ridethefire122> djquery well, I'm trying to make it so that upon a click of a (non-linked) <li>, the player will play an associated media file. does this make sense, and if so, do you have any suggestions for how I'd go about implementing it?
[23:59:55] <Murugaratham> any1 can help with jQuery templates?
