[01:53:09] <sonu_nk> hi good moning.
[02:24:54] <sonu_nk> hi, i want to rename each class of my one plugin in short way and in less time.. my plugin is creating issue with website's css , there is some conflicts coming between css...
[02:35:58] <sonu_nk> Cork, hey hi how are you doing?
[03:07:28] <latemus> robertmaxreese: event delegation did the trick. thanks again
[03:07:34] * latemus my hero
[03:08:10] <latemus> delegation is cool
[03:08:25] <atroclize> can anyone here help me with callback functions?
[03:24:08] <atroclize> In node.js documentation when there is a callback function as a formal parameter how are you supposed to know which and how many arguments are going to be passed to your callback function?
[03:41:14] <Kartagis> sonu_nk: you can do that with sed
[03:41:46] <sonu_nk> ?
[03:41:50] <sonu_nk> Kartagis, ??
[03:42:16] <Kartagis> [09:23:59] <sonu_nk> hi, i want to rename each class of my one plugin in short way and in less time.. my plugin is creating issue with website's css , there is some conflicts coming between css...
[03:42:55] <sonu_nk> Kartagis, yes..so you suggest then ?
[03:43:10] <Kartagis> use sed
[03:43:44] <sonu_nk> wht is this?
[03:43:44] <Kartagis> sed 's/oldName/newName/g' file.txt
[03:44:07] <Kartagis> linux binary
[03:44:08] <sonu_nk> sorry not familer with sed what is this ?
[03:44:16] <Kartagis> also works on mac
[03:44:34] <Kartagis> file manipulation tool
[03:44:41] <Cork> search and replace in your fav text editor can also do it
[03:45:41] <sonu_nk> Cork, i can do that..but issue is : i am using a form builder parent core liab.and these classes coming from there.. so if i will remove the classes then possible plugin will not work .. :)
[03:45:42] <Kartagis> aye, that too
[03:46:09] <Cork> sonu_nk: ook?
[03:46:12] <Kartagis> now is a good time to make a backup
[03:46:33] <sonu_nk> I am trying to replace all classed after form render using jquery
[03:46:39] <Kartagis> if changing js is too much problem for you, change the css
[03:46:46] <Cork> if the class names are needed the way they are, you only have two other options, write css to override the behavior you don't want in the case you don't want it
[03:47:08] <Cork> or make the other part of the site use a different class name instead of the one the plugin uses
[03:47:31] <Cork> there isn't really a third object
[03:47:55] <sonu_nk> like there is a class in website ( .header { position:fixed;}  ) and my plugn also have header class .. now my header class conflicts coming :(
[03:48:45] <Cork> sonu_nk: so make the .header more specific so it doesn't match the .header the plugin creates
[03:49:00] <Cork> or like i said, replace your .header with another class for your page
[03:49:11] <sonu_nk> Cork, like ?? you are saying .__header { } ???
[03:49:21] <Cork> uhuh... no
[03:50:02] <Cork> for example if they have <elm class="plugin"><elm class="header"> and it is always like that
[03:50:20] <Cork> you can change .header in your case to :not(.plugin) > .header {}
[03:50:41] <Cork> or, yea just change .header to .page-header or something
[03:50:52] <sonu_nk> not possible on client side.. i am just giving my script and div to render form .. and everything rending automatically .. i cant ask user to change  your css.. :P
[03:50:54] <Cork> __header sounds like a bad name choice though
[03:51:21] <Cork> sonu_nk: well then you're only other option is to monkey patch the lib your using
[03:51:43] <Cork> cause adding class dependencies to third party pages without a namespace prefix is a bad idea
[03:51:52] <sonu_nk> yes..
[03:52:14] <Cork> should always be like .my-plugin-name-header and similar
[03:52:14] <Cork> and is why jquery ui uses ui-*
[03:53:08] <sonu_nk> yes..i am doing the same.. looking more specfic changes in plugin..
[03:53:13] <sonu_nk> doing that/
[04:06:59] <Whiskey> i try to slove this problem -> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/3/ <- also need to be executed by clicking on the "try an example"
[04:07:21] <Whiskey> i thinked, .text() was one way but maybe it don´t do what i thinked it will do
[04:10:39] <Cork> you forgot to say what line you're talking about
[04:11:56] <Whiskey> hmm
[04:11:59] <Whiskey> im not sure
[04:12:10] <Whiskey> the one that errors
[04:12:26] <Whiskey> its 155 but maybe it can be done before it come to that line to avoid it
[04:12:53] <Whiskey> it as 155 :D
[04:13:21] <Whiskey> errors is on 84
[04:49:42] <hvk> hey, i have my own "light box" and i wanted to copy element inside and only when i click outside copied element -> lightbox to hide lightbox but it works everywhere i tried to stoppropaginate event but it still works :( any tips? https://pastebin.com/UKUdsRjr
[05:23:06] <teta> is anybody aware of something called      ui-jqgrid-hdiv      ?
[05:25:30] <cannap> yes
[05:26:33] <teta> so the jqgrid I have somehow builds a div with that class
[05:26:42] <teta> but it gives it a height and a width
[05:26:59] <cannap> ah no
[05:27:00] <cannap> i dont know
[05:27:04] <cannap> i missread sorry
[05:27:06] <cannap> :/
[05:45:37] <Cork> teta: last i checked it (and this was many years ago) it is so it could support expandable rows where you had extra data for the row
[05:45:45] <Cork> teta: and that is why it had a fixed height
[06:12:47] <Anticom> Cork: You there? o/
[06:18:27] <teta> $('.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('height');
[06:18:31] <teta> do you like that?
[06:20:24] <Cork> no, that would look for an attribute
[06:20:39] <Cork> if you want to remove it generically just set it in your css file
[06:27:15] <Anticom> Cork: Time for a 30 seconds code review? I'm a bit rusty when it comes to Promises / Deferred: https://plnkr.co/edit/ql7DK1KxQa9ENOWaxmPe?p=preview
[06:27:29] <Anticom> Just wanted to make sure i got this right
[06:38:47] <Anticom> Anyone else maybe?
[06:40:50] <teta> is this ok?    $('.ui-jqgrid .ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('width');
[06:41:40] <Anticom> teta: usually you would set styles via "style" attribute which contains CSS
[06:42:06] <teta> Anticom: but the identification of the item is fine...
[06:42:35] <Anticom> teta: depends on what you want to select ;)
[06:43:59] <Anticom> teta: currently you're selecting all elements having the class 'ui-jqgrid-bdiv' THAT ARE (not neccesarily directly) INSIDE the elements having the class 'ui-jqgrid'
[06:44:56] <teta> yep that's good
[06:50:07] <Anticom> teta: still. i'd rather use https://api.jquery.com/css/ to modify styles on elements
[06:50:10] <teta> $('div.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('height');
[06:50:25] <teta> all the divs with class ui-jqgrid-bdiv ?
[06:50:40] <Anticom> or you could optionally add a class to your css file and simply add/remove the class depending on your element's state
[06:51:01] <Anticom> this is more portable because other users of your lib could just write their own css if they want to change anything concerning style
[06:54:56] <teta> Anticom: no this is not working             $('div.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('height');
[06:58:55] <ace139> hey, i need to implement jquery ui autocomplete feature into ckeditor. i need some help. any help is greatly appreciated.
[07:17:17] <Cork> Anticom: there's no content in that link
[07:17:30] <Anticom> w00t
[07:17:33] <Cork> (only html and a script tag including jquery)
[07:18:00] <Anticom> Cork: can't you click on "script.js" on the left nav?
[07:18:23] <Cork> ah
[07:18:24] <Anticom> i had script.js open when i copied the URL. I thought it would encode that state in the URL somehow, meh
[07:18:50] <Anticom> ace139: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ckeditor+autocomplete first result for me
[07:18:53] <Anticom> (StackOverflow=
[07:18:54] <Anticom> )*
[07:19:01] <Cork> Anticom: why are you using deferred at all?
[07:19:12] <Cork> your just rechaining the built in one from getJSON
[07:19:43] <Anticom> Cork: TL;DR; the xhr enpoint i'm calling is giving me a serialNo which is static for one session, hence i'd like to cache that
[07:19:56] <Cork> ok?
[07:20:05] <Cork> why do you need to use deferred cause of that?
[07:20:15] <Kartagis> what's the point in using PouchDB and CouchDB together if PouchDB is CouchDB derivative?
[07:20:27] <Anticom> Cork: so i can return a promise even if the serialNo is cached already --> persistent api
[07:20:43] <Anticom> it wouldn't make sense to return a deferred the first time and a string the second time
[07:20:44] <Cork> but you're not
[07:20:58] <Cork> you never fire the deferred call in the second case
[07:21:13] <Anticom> Kartagis: 1st: probably wrong channel, 2nd: PouchDB stores the data in your browser's storage
[07:21:24] <Cork> so it basically just means it does nothing if getVAlueCached is called once
[07:21:29] <Anticom> Cork:  Well as i said, never really used deferred before :/
[07:21:49] <Anticom> Cork: hm but in the dev tools it seems to work just fine
[07:21:51] <Kartagis> doesn't CouchDB do the same thing?
[07:22:00] <Anticom> Kartagis: CouchDB resides on your server
[07:22:15] <Anticom> Kartagis: PouchDB **runs** in your browser and even stores the data, hence you can use Pouch offline
[07:22:23] <Anticom> Kartagis: whereas you can't use Couch offline
[07:22:24] <Kartagis> oh like mysql
[07:23:00] <Kartagis> sorry, I thought they were both javascript databases, so that's why I asked here
[07:23:02] <Anticom> Kartagis: there's probably #pouchdb, otherwise i'd recommend ##javascript, IMO #jquery is the wrong channel for that
[07:23:08] <Anticom> np
[07:23:17] <Anticom> Cork: so what would i have to change?
[07:23:31] <Anticom> And moreover, why is it working then :O
[07:24:43] <Anticom> Cork: uh, had a typo in getJSON's url
[07:25:08] <Anticom> now it's working again for me
[07:25:19] <Cork> Anticom: https://jsfiddle.net/m46b2jLy/ something like that is how it is meant to be used
[07:26:50] <Anticom> Cork: i'd have to dig through that for a bit
[07:27:17] <Anticom> basically i took the start of my implementation from the docs https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/examples/#asynchronous-cache
[07:27:51] <Cork> huh... might be they added a new structure in jquery 3
[07:28:05] <Cork> but ya, $.Deferred didn't use to accept a callback
[07:29:32] <Anticom> Cork: also your code has a syntax error in L10 ;)
[07:29:46] <Anticom> Cork: i suppose the .done should be chained to .fail (?)
[07:29:48] <Cork> ya, i just quickly wipped somethign together
[07:29:54] <Cork> yes
[07:30:05] <Anticom> me gusta
[07:30:09] <Cork> ah, missed the ;
[07:30:25] <Cork> or typed it automatically ;P
[07:30:44] <Anticom> no problem, thank's for the review
[07:31:26] <Cork> yikes that definition isn't clear at all... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[07:31:48] <Cork> "A function that is called just before the constructor returns." :/
[07:32:11] <Cork> so ya, it looks like it would be about the same thing as i did
[07:32:49] <Cork> Anticom: btw worth mentioning as long as you allow the request to be cached you can let the browser cache this automatically
[07:33:00] <Cork> and just do the getJSON call straight
[07:33:06] <Anticom> Cork: hm in your solution the xhr is never fired :/
[07:33:37] <Cork> Anticom: the xhr?
[07:33:42] <Cork> what do you mean?
[07:33:43] <Anticom> $.getJSON
[07:33:47] <Cork> sure it is
[07:33:51] <Cork> line 8
[07:34:03] <Anticom> Cork: i mean in my dev tools
[07:34:06] <Anticom> it never actually fires
[07:34:13] <Cork> hmm
[07:34:38] <Cork> one min
[07:35:49] <Cork> Anticom: another typo https://jsfiddle.net/m46b2jLy/1/
[07:35:53] <Cork> missed the () after .status
[07:37:32] <Cork> Anticom: btw i would prob do it like this https://jsfiddle.net/m46b2jLy/2/
[07:37:41] <Cork> keeping cache private sounds like a good idea
[07:38:21] <Anticom> Cork: i'm using TypeScript and cache is a private static member of my class
[07:38:35] <Anticom> i'm not into ES6 classes yet, hence i just added the comment above cache :)
[07:38:51] <Anticom> Cork: btw works now, thank's again
[07:39:12] <Cork> Anticom: both solutions should work about the same
[07:39:24] <Cork> though that said...
[07:39:28] <Cork> one min
[07:41:38] <Cork> Anticom: this should do the exact same thing https://jsfiddle.net/m46b2jLy/3/
[07:41:44] <Cork> and much less complexity
[07:42:55] <Anticom> Cork: this was only an excerpt from my localStorage api abstraction ;)
[07:43:01] <Anticom> but thanks for the effort
[07:43:09] <Cork> Anticom: the point is the deferred doesn't add anything
[07:43:13] <Anticom> i don't like pasting huge blobs of code to illustrate a single small issue
[07:43:26] <Cork> you can just use the return value from $.getJSON().then()
[07:43:34] <Cork> it will be identical
[07:43:55] <Cork> currently you are resolving a deferred to then create a new deferred with the same value
[07:44:07] <Anticom> hm, good point :D
[07:44:28] <Anticom> Cork: again, i still have to get used to async code using promises / deferred objects
[07:44:49] <Cork> ya, it isn't really that complicated
[07:45:00] <Cork> think of it as passing around an object with list of callbacks
[07:45:13] <Cork> and then when you have resolved it adding new callbacks fire directly
[07:45:33] <Cork> with the old stored value that is
[07:45:42] <Cork> that's basically all deferred are
[07:48:21] <Anticom> Cork: iirc there is some behaviour to keep in mind, for example when the promise is rejected the call chain is broken, right?
[07:48:39] <Cork> Anticom: what do you mean?
[07:48:53] <Cork> it is ever only called once
[07:49:09] <Anticom> Cork: well if you do promise.fail(firstFunc).fail(secondFunc); and promise get's rejected only firstFunc is actually called
[07:49:17] <Cork> no
[07:49:21] <Cork> all will be called
[07:49:36] <Cork> .then is != .fail though
[07:49:37] <Anticom> Cork: oh i think i was confusing this with rxjs
[07:49:46] <Cork> .then REPLACES the deferred object
[07:49:47] <Anticom> iirc they got that kind of semantic
[07:49:55] <Cork> so unless it returns a new one the chain is broken
[07:50:37] <Anticom> Cork: hm i thought you could just return some arbitrary value which get's wrapped in a promise automatically and if you didn't return anything a Promise<void> is created and passed along
[07:50:39] <Cork> so .then is a bit scary when i see ppl us it with out the explicit intent of modifying the return value
[07:50:49] <Anticom> meh, i have to read up on this a little more, just haven't had the time yet
[07:50:53] <Cork> Anticom: yes, but if you don't return or return undefiend the chain dies
[07:51:40] <Cork> so i tend to have the rule that .then is when you want to modify the response
[07:51:49] <Cork> in all other cases use fail/done/always
[08:09:23] <Anticom> Cork: Sorry for the late response but thanks for the elaboration :)
[08:10:06] <Cork> yw
[08:10:21] <Cork> and this is irc, i don't expect quick responses :)
[08:16:56] <Anticom> Cork: Needed urgent resupply of coffee ;)
[09:06:37] <keka> $('<div/>').css
[09:06:43] <keka> what does that target?
[09:06:55] <keka> any div that is "self contained" ?
[09:08:40] <shoky_> keka: it creates a new div (that is not in the DOM) and targets that div
[09:09:22] <keka> the dom is basically every tag in the html page right?
[09:09:54] <shoky_> every node in the live running page, yes
[09:14:14] <keka> $('div.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('style');
[09:14:42] <keka> shoky_: this will target every single div in the application with class ui-jqgrid-bdiv ?
[09:16:39] <shoky_> keka: ya
[09:36:02] <keka> shoky_: please explain this?    $('div', $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear])).first().data('doReset')();
[09:36:54] <shoky_> keka: $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear])  i assume that's a selector string so it'll find some element..
[09:37:06] <shoky_> or it's an element itself, and that'll wrap it in a jquery object
[09:37:27] <shoky_> keka:   $('div', ...)  is the same thing as:   $(...).find('div')
[09:38:13] <shoky_> keka:  .first()  limits to only the first matched element.  .data('doReset')  gets the private data that was previously set (using .data())
[09:38:32] <shoky_> keka:  and whatever that data was set to, seems to be a function,  becausse the () at the end calls it as a function.
[09:39:09] <keka> so it'll go to          searchTenByYear[currentContentYear] -> searchTenByYear -> get first element -> get data
[09:39:16] <shoky_> keka: it's a very bad line of code, whoever wrote it should be shot ;)  or disciplined anyways,  or at least pointed at :(
[09:39:40] <shoky_> keka: i don't know what you mean by that..  what does  searchTenByYear[currentContentYear] -> searchTenByYear   mean
[09:41:46] <shoky_> keka: it'll find the first <div> inside whatever is found by  $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]),  and it'll fetch this div's `doReset` data, and call it as a function
[09:43:58] <keka> I could also do            $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]).find('div').css('height', 0);
[09:44:05] <keka> is that correct?
[09:44:57] <shoky_> keka: that would do something totally different.. but you can do that, yes ;)
[09:45:38] <shoky_> keka: the only part that's the same is that $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]).find('div')  is same as  $('div', $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]))
[09:46:18] <shoky_> otherwise.. one calls .first().data('doReset')()   and the other calls  .css('height', 0)
[09:46:30] <shoky_> which are not so similar ;p
[09:47:00] <keka> $('div.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('width');
[09:47:06] <keka> but if I do this
[09:47:19] <keka> it would still go to the same div right?
[09:47:23] <shoky_> huh?
[09:47:43] <keka> because you said it goes to every div with class ui-jqgrid-bdiv
[09:47:47] <shoky_> "same div"? as what?  i have no idea what your DOM looks like..
[09:47:55] <shoky_> yes?
[09:48:16] <keka> $(searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]).find('div')
[09:48:24] <keka> so if this points to a div
[09:48:45] <keka> then it will also be subject to the change in css in this line
[09:48:55] <keka> $('div.ui-jqgrid-bdiv').removeAttr('width');
[09:49:01] <shoky_> why..?
[09:49:16] <shoky_> the 2nd line  only gets .ui-jqgrid-bdiv  divs
[09:49:31] <shoky_> and the 1st line only gets divs inside whatever searchTenByYear[currentContentYear]  is
[09:49:33] <keka> well let's say that div for some reason had the same class
[09:49:51] <shoky_> if they both find the same div - then they both find the same div
[09:49:54] <shoky_> donno what you're asking :)
[09:50:43] <shoky_> and you can easily check all of this, without asking here..
[10:19:43] <Caspan_> how do i select somethign based on its data-id =234
[10:20:35] <MikeD_> Caspan_: [data-id=234]
[10:21:04] <Caspan_> so $('[data-id=234]')   ?
[10:21:25] <Caspan_> why the square brackets in this case?
[10:21:48] <MikeD_> the square brackets is how you look for attribute values
[10:22:23] <MikeD_> the caveat here is that "look at every don node for ones with a data-id attribute value of 234 is a big ask
[10:22:27] <MikeD_> dom
[10:22:55] <Caspan_> is that not normally how a select works it searches the dom till it finds a match?
[10:23:06] <Caspan_> or is this more intensive search
[10:23:47] <MikeD_> $('#mysection').find('[data-id=234') would start at #mysection rather than the top of the document tree
[10:23:50] <Caspan_> i guess my IDs are unique i could just give all my rows id-234
[10:23:54] <Caspan_> id=234*
[10:23:59] <Caspan_> then target it with that
[10:24:01] <MikeD_> that would be much better
[10:24:11] <MikeD_> ... though not always possible
[10:24:24] <Caspan_> yeah jsut seeing in my layout if that is possible
[10:24:29] <MikeD_> because if you have that row in two different controls on the same page, you'll violate the uniqueness requirement
[10:24:46] <Caspan_> row only ever shows once ever on my page
[10:24:48] <MikeD_> but that can also be mitigates by compound id
[10:24:57] <Caspan_> ohh compound IDs :)
[10:24:58] <MikeD_> yeah, then use the actual id selector
[10:26:35] <MikeD_> heh, as far as the DOM is concerned, you can make id values out of tab name + table name + primary key, etc.  so you don't accidentally put the same PK on the page in two places - because the tab or section name is part of the child/grandchild id acting like a namespace
[10:27:06] <MikeD_> there's no 'right' solution, just better or worse solutions
[10:27:28] <Caspan_> so for income i could do I234  for bills B234  etc...
[10:27:36] <Caspan_> i understand
[10:27:58] <Z3R0> hello! Trying to create a formdata object, but my formdata seems to be “empty” https://gist.github.com/anonymous/34df3bf1e308ac3bc5096fab96644bd9 ?
[10:28:09] <MikeD_> yup - you get some debugging hell when you collide id
[10:28:33] <Caspan_> All my rows comes from the same table in SQL so there is no possible way for an ID overlap unless for some reason I display the row again for editing etc which i dont do..
[10:28:39] <Caspan_> geat thanks
[10:28:42] <Caspan_> great*
[10:33:05] <Z3R0> well, formdata shows empty, but it’s still being sent, so yay!
[10:53:14] <Duikb00t> o/
[10:53:28] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea why my [ ] clone into the array is not working? https://jsfiddle.net/vdnLq1qg/2/
[10:53:37] <Duikb00t> I retrieve the amount etc but ... it's not cloning it
[10:53:47] <Duikb00t> i would like to have an idex for my fields
[11:05:51] <keka> so here's the thing. I build a table with jqgrid
[11:06:11] <keka> this is put inside a div which seems to change dimensions dinamically
[11:06:49] <keka> with this dynamic change of the size of the div
[11:07:21] <keka> sometimes it looks wrong
[11:07:25] <keka> so I'm trying to remove it
[11:07:31] <keka> any suggestions?
[11:17:55] <Z3R0> I’m uplaoding a CSV to my database, using ajax -> laravel backend, just curious if anyone knows of a way to return something from the server to update progress, since it’s doing the entire file at once, is there anyway to return something during the run, or do I have to send multiple requests and chunk it?
[11:21:46] <truckcrash> Hello,
[11:21:46] <truckcrash> I am making an ajax call, and getting a 200 response, but the script is executing through the error path instead of success.
[11:21:55] <truckcrash> Anyone know why that would be?
[11:26:25] <cmrabet> Is there anything special with jquery 3.1.1, every single plugin I try to use, I get errors like jquery.slimmenu.min.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: e(...).find(...).stop is not a function
[11:37:21] <shoky_> truckcrash: that usually happens when the content type is JSON but the actual content is not valid JSON
[11:38:02] <shoky_> truckcrash: another reason could be a CORS issue (request is not to same origin)
[11:38:26] <shoky_> truckcrash: log the arguments to the error handler
[11:38:53] <truckcrash> shoky_, Thanks, yes as I look into it, I am getting a JSON parsing error.
[11:39:01] <truckcrash> My response is valid json though.
[11:39:01] <truckcrash> {"success": true}
[11:39:09] <truckcrash> Content type header is set too
[11:39:25] <shoky_> truckcrash: that's the full response body, from your browser's devtools network tab?
[11:39:32] <truckcrash> correct
[11:39:55] <truckcrash> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
[11:40:33] <shoky_> truckcrash: share your code maybe, donno..
[11:41:12] <shoky_> JSON.parse is being fed invalid JSON, anyways
[11:41:42] <shoky_> maybe you got some weird encoding on the response
[11:41:58] <truckcrash> yeah, ok, I will look into it here for a sec.
[11:42:00] <truckcrash> thanks for looking
[11:43:22] <shoky_> truckcrash are you calling JSON.parse yourself?
[11:48:45] <truckcrash> shoky_, At which part? I do in my success function, but the code never executes there.
[11:50:41] <shoky_> truckcrash: well if you're sure it never executes then nevermind that, but.. you're not supposed to call it yourself usually, jquery parses it for you and gives you the parsed object as response , if there was a proper content-type
[11:51:04] <shoky_> truckcrash: and you'd get such an error if you try to JSON.parse an already parsed object..
[11:52:50] <truckcrash> shoky_, Thanks, yes. I don't think that is the current problem. But you have solved a future bug.
[12:04:02] <toggle> I have a easy question, i want to hide $(this) hide me section check here https://jsfiddle.net/7avt8rth/
[12:04:35] <sillyslux> 4x id="holder"
[12:04:41] <toggle> sillyslux: yes
[12:04:46] <sillyslux> id 's are meant to be used only once
[12:04:57] <toggle> sillyslux: yes but its the dialog ui
[12:05:28] <toggle> sillyslux: i just want to toggle the hide me of $(this)
[12:07:18] <sillyslux> something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/7avt8rth/1/
[12:07:24] <sillyslux> but it's all wrong
[12:07:53] <toggle> sillyslux: thanks i think this will work
[12:07:56] <toggle> sillyslux: why is it wrong ?
[12:08:12] <sillyslux> ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").
[12:08:21] <sillyslux> no space in ids
[12:08:35] <sillyslux> and they should be unique
[12:08:42] <sillyslux> make that a must
[12:08:52] <toggle> sillyslux: correct, but I let users pick nicknames like "this is my nick" with spaces
[12:09:08] <toggle> sillyslux: and i put there nick in the div id
[12:09:12] <sillyslux> and then you want to use that as an id?
[12:09:18] <toggle> sillyslux: yes
[12:10:01] <sillyslux> i'd work around that somehow
[12:10:14] <toggle> sillyslux: is there a way to trigger the $(this).next().toggle(100) once ? I dont like the way to do it with count++
[12:10:25] <toggle> sillyslux: later maybe i will work around that
[12:10:34] <sillyslux> count?
[12:10:35] <sillyslux> where?
[12:11:13] <toggle> sillyslux: now if i click $("[id='test it']") .... this triggers it 4 times because there are 4 divs.
[12:11:26] <toggle> sillyslux: with same name
[12:11:51] <toggle> sillyslux:  I rater want it trigger it once, because i just want THAT dialog not other
[12:12:09] <sillyslux> what's happening?
[12:12:20] <sillyslux> all 4 do hide?
[12:12:26] <sillyslux> when you click one?
[12:14:57] <toggle> sillyslux: yes its a strange behavior, dialog one closed second also an third dont, than second dont . i counldt understand it
[12:15:04] <MikeD_> is there much use for using .trigger( $.Event('click') )  vs .trigger( 'click' )  ?
[12:15:18] <MikeD_> i realize it's useful for keypress, etc.
[12:15:29] <sillyslux> that's why you shouldn't use id's twice
[12:15:38] <sillyslux> not happening here
[12:16:34] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/7avt8rth/2/ every click raises click count by one for me
[12:16:50] <sillyslux> better work around it now
[12:19:26] <toggle> sillyslux: i get a strange one, it hides that quickly shows the toggled div
[12:21:22] <sillyslux> expect strange when reusing ids
[12:21:24] <toggle> sillyslux: i think i know what it is, how can i make a on click event whenever the div is not exist ?
[12:21:47] <sillyslux> not exist? you mean hidden?
[12:22:46] <toggle> sillyslux: no not created yet, dialog ui created the titlebar after its created. What I now did is whenever dialog creats the title bar i triggered the event. But every new title bar does +1 on click events
[12:23:33] <toggle> sillyslux: i want to do a FB efect when clicking on dialog titlebar than minimalize
[12:24:23] <sillyslux> I#d strongly suggest not can't really follow you... maybe you want delegated events?
[12:24:51] <sillyslux> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/

[12:47:42] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/7avt8rth/4/
[12:54:14] <toggle> sillyslux: thanks! because of this I found my problem. I didnt triggered the init section where i trigger the events section -_-!
[12:55:20] <toggle> sillyslux: so because of non of those exists I need to trigger on document first right ?
[12:55:54] <robertmaxrees> toggle is the issue that an event handler doesn't work for an element you add after the page loads?
[12:56:05] <sloft> trigger... this add and eventlistener to document
[12:56:12] <sloft> *adds an
[12:56:24] <sloft> attaches... :(
[12:56:33] <sloft> i should eat something
[12:56:54] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener.  you can use document, though I'd try to bind a little forther down to something more contextual.
[12:57:52] <toggle> robertmaxrees: so instead of on() do bind() ?
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:58:11] <robertmaxrees> you use .on() - it handles delegation for you if you use it right.
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle from sillyslux shows the basix usage.
[12:58:44] <robertmaxrees> he also linked the learning center article on delegation - i'd give taht a read.
[12:58:55] <toggle> robertmaxrees: how would use the binding in my situation ?
[12:59:35] <robertmaxrees> if you're appending to body, then what sillyslux showed you will be fine.
[13:16:29] <cmrabet> Using jquery 3.1.1, each time I want to use somebody else's js code by including in my page with <script> I get errors saying funciton xyz is not defined
[13:16:34] <cmrabet> Can any one help me?¿
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet show us the error condition
[13:17:01] <robertmaxrees> like - can you link to a case of this happening?
[13:17:05] <cmrabet> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).find(...).stop is not a function
[13:17:31] <cmrabet> I'm trying to use this code: http://adnantopal.github.io/slimmenu/
[13:17:46] <cmrabet> I've added the script tag before the body one and after including jquery
[13:18:10] <cmrabet> the menu shows up properly, but as soon as I hover on it, I get the error
[13:18:11] <robertmaxrees> both places at the same time ooor...?
[13:18:35] <cmrabet> I edited the code, I removed the .stop function and just added .hide and I get the same error, hide is not a function
[13:19:04] <cmrabet> it seems no matter what the method is, $(this) whaterver is not coming back with the methods
[13:19:15] <robertmaxrees> i have to see it break.
[13:19:28] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/LL06vx9g/
[13:19:44] <robertmaxrees> this has jquery 3.1.1 and the menu plguin included - mind slapping your markup in there?
[13:22:09] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: ok, hold on
[13:23:19] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: I did, and it's workign there
[13:23:33] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: the only difference is that in my project I have also bootstrap 4.0 js loaded
[13:27:27] <cmrabet> this is how I'm initiating the module: https://jsfiddle.net/LL06vx9g/2/
[13:27:36] <cmrabet> perhaps that's the problem
[13:29:53] <cmrabet>  I can't load a js file
[13:30:02] <cmrabet> I don't understand what's going on
[13:33:25] <cmrabet> I'm using this version of jquery
[13:33:26] <cmrabet> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.slim.min.js"></script>
[13:33:47] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> can you add the html, too?
[13:34:21] <sigdk> $.get("file.html", function(data){ $("#div").html(data);});  can file.html be a full html page or shall it be just a div?
[13:34:36] <robertmaxrees> sigdk either, but i'd make it just a div if that's all you need.
[13:34:52] <cmrabet> FIXED
[13:34:58] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[13:35:05] <cmrabet> the problem whas the jquery version I was importing
[13:35:07] <cmrabet> I had:
[13:35:10] <cmrabet> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.slim.min.js"></script>
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the slim build would be suspect there.
[13:35:15] <cmrabet> I replaced that with:
[13:35:17] <cmrabet> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[13:35:19] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it's not really that much smaller.
[13:35:27] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, that's all I need... but there are css and js files that go with this div.... so I guess I need to pack everything within <html></html> ... right?
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> and you miss out on a lot of stuff.
[13:35:36] <robertmaxrees> sigdk errrr
[13:35:47] <robertmaxrees> sigdk you want to not have css and js as apart of that.
[13:35:50] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: yeah, I didn't notice, I was freaking out man, 4 hours lost in this shit
[13:35:58] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I'm trying to refactor my code... it's a single html file with a single js file :/
[13:36:02] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet glad you figured it out.
[13:36:10] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: thanks for your help
[13:36:22] <robertmaxrees> sigdk that's fine... you just don't want to include CSS and JS in that standalone page.
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need it?
[13:36:30] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet any time :)
[13:38:08] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, see the following example: index.html where I click a button and I see a RegisterUser form (in index.js I have code to validate the form).  Preferably I'd like to create a user.html and user.js  and just use a div of the main page to load everything
[13:38:27] <robertmaxrees> sigdk that's a bad way to do that.
[13:38:28] <sigdk> I 'd like to create also a user.css
[13:38:33] <sigdk> oh, why?
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> all of your js and css should be included in the main page.
[13:39:05] <robertmaxrees> because you're trying to dynamically load in js and css manually which is a massive PITA
[13:39:19] <robertmaxrees> you should load those resources on pageload and then init things as appropriate.
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> you can still separate out the CSS and JS.  just don't load them as apart of that fragment of markup.
[13:39:56] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, but isn't it bad the user to fetch all these files even he 'd never click on the registration form button?
[13:40:15] <robertmaxrees> are you having load time issues?
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> because something tells me the amount of JS isn't a problem.
[13:40:33] <sigdk> robertmaxrees no I don't
[13:40:42] <robertmaxrees> don't solve problems you don't get have ;)
[13:40:44] <sigdk> no it's not... I just want to know the "right way"
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> separate file is fine, but load it on pageload.
[13:41:42] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, it will also be easier to handle different users. Ie. the registration form is only for the admin. I wouldn't like to send js code to unauthorized users
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> do that part server-side for pageload then.
[13:42:10] <robertmaxrees> or create a separate view for admins.
[13:42:13] <robertmaxrees> and lock down that page.
[13:44:29] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, okay, back to my initial question... $.get("file.html", function(data){ $("#div").html(data);});   file.html should just have a div and I load all these at the very beginning of my page, right?
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> well, back up again.
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> why load it via ajax?
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> why not do this all server-side?
[13:46:18] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, can you explain? what do you mean server-side?
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> you said you're trying to split this up to make it a little more organized, right?
[13:47:38] <sigdk> yes
[13:47:57] <robertmaxrees> you can have that just fine.  but instead of doing it client-side, do it server-side.
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> what language are you using server-side?
[13:48:51] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, java. Pages are in jsp
[13:49:08] <robertmaxrees> then use that side to pull in files to render out.

[14:37:13] <brezimenko> is what edge debugger says
[14:37:16] <Neo_122> maybe need include it hither than selectric ?
[14:37:21] <brezimenko> http://www.petrol.si/nes
[14:37:24] <Neo_122> higher ?
[14:37:30] <robertmaxrees> Neo_122 wait
[14:37:33] <robertmaxrees> Neo_122 http://selectric.js.org/demo.html
[14:37:46] <robertmaxrees> this shows the exact same styling as what you've got on mobile.  so what's the problem?
[14:37:49] <robertmaxrees> is it the callback?
[14:38:38] <robertmaxrees> brezimenko running document.getElementById("uploadFile") in my console returns null.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> so that element doesn't exist.
[14:39:06] <brezimenko> I got the page today, previous employee did it. So I'm kinda lost.
[14:39:14] <brezimenko> Should the element simply be deleted?
[14:39:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:21] <robertmaxrees> the element doesn't exist.
[14:39:33] <brezimenko> Should the callback to that element be deleted
[14:39:36] <brezimenko> is what i meant
[14:39:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not my call to make...
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it'd break a few bits of functionality.
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> also:
[14:40:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting the same error in FF.
[14:40:45] <robertmaxrees> and chrome.
[14:40:47] <brezimenko> But the slideshow works.
[14:40:51] <robertmaxrees> they just phrase the error message differently.
[14:41:16] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter - fix that error and your problems should go away.
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> when does #uploadFile exist on the page?
[14:41:42] <brezimenko> I have to go now but thanks for the insight
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> there's an easy fix here...
[14:41:52] <brezimenko> will be back, definitely :)
[14:42:00] <brezimenko> what is it?
[14:42:20] <robertmaxrees> wrap that block in a if (document.getElementById("uploadFile")) {
[14:42:42] <robertmaxrees> like https://bpaste.net/show/0235bda75088
[14:43:08] <robertmaxrees> also you can shorten that wrapper to just this: https://bpaste.net/show/bc41b6ef17dd
[14:43:10] <brezimenko> i'll do it when i come back and sing you praise if it works
[14:43:16] <brezimenko> thanks a bunch one more time :)
[14:45:02] <Uhkis> and use more jquery to shorten it a lot more :P
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> don't always have to use jquery for everything (shrug)
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> and if he's in crunch mode, might not be the right time.
[14:45:38] <robertmaxrees> good lesson for later though.
[14:47:48] <Uhkis> oh this was some inherited thing
[14:48:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:54:58] <Neo_122> I include jQuery one and selectric dont' work ?? ?
[14:58:39] <Neo_122> my selectric last version v1.11.1
[14:58:59] <Neo_122> robertmaxtrees, hey maybe this can't work in mobile ?
[15:10:42] <robertmaxrees> Neo_122 their site says it does.
[15:11:10] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[15:11:17] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you keep insisting on that,
[15:11:51] <Neo_122> robertmaxress, but in my site it don't work http://aksioma.lesqa.com/categories_blog/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0-2/
[15:12:02] <robertmaxrees> Neo_122 that doesn't mean it doesn't support mobile.
[15:12:08] <robertmaxrees> there may very well be another issue.
[15:12:20] <robertmaxrees> maybe you have a bad event listener somewhere causing the problem.
[15:17:07] <Neo_122> don't know
[15:17:12] <Neo_122> maybe this don't work
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[15:18:17] <robertmaxrees> ;lol
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you doubt it so much.
[15:28:30] <Whiskey> $test.val() <- is it someway to read that val() as text() so it not read html code as html code
[15:28:37] <robertmaxrees> huh
[15:28:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:28:48] <Whiskey> yeh, like escaped
[15:29:09] <Whiskey> what i understand is text() like escaped code that don´t run html code if it is any and just read the text inside it
[15:31:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/wq7Ltmv8/
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> try putting <em>lol</em> in that text input then click "click me"
[15:31:37] <robertmaxrees> watch what happens.
[15:32:58] <Whiskey> $('div').text($('input').val()); why do you need div?
[15:33:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:33:13] <robertmaxrees> just giving it a place to go.
[15:33:17] <robertmaxrees> could be literally any other element.
[15:33:18] <Whiskey> aaaa ofc
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm demonstrating that it's text.
[15:33:35] <robertmaxrees> you're worried about something that you don't need to worry about.
[15:33:53] <robertmaxrees> however, you DO want to sanitize that input server-side before it goes to your DB.
[15:33:55] <robertmaxrees> and on the way out.
[15:33:57] <Whiskey> if you don´t need it someway to go, and just will store it in a variable
[15:34:27] <Whiskey> like const var = text($('input').val());
[15:34:34] <Whiskey> but that won´t work i think
[15:38:22] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: like https://jsfiddle.net/wq7Ltmv8/3/
[15:47:31] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:47:41] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue here?
[15:47:55] <robertmaxrees> put differently, what are you expecting to happen?
[15:49:40] <vacho> https://paste.ofcode.org/PTYdHEzvq6m5namWqnzsXq this code executes fine..but when I run line 15, it toggled without respecting the value on line 3
[15:50:54] <robertmaxrees> vacho make a fiddle.
[15:51:16] <vacho> too tedious
[15:51:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:51:22] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy in fact.
[15:53:21] <robertmaxrees> fwiw 'this' probably isn't what you think it is.
[15:53:30] <robertmaxrees> but maybe it is.
[15:53:49] <vacho> https://jsfiddle.net/
[15:53:54] <vacho> how do I make it include jquery library
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/vlds2Tj.png
[15:56:28] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees; it won´t work anyways i found out :D
[15:56:40] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey huh?
[15:56:47] <robertmaxrees> still not clear what your issue was.
[15:56:48] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[15:57:08] <vacho> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/sjso3zhu/
[15:57:36] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so how to i replicate the bug?
[15:57:39] <vacho> when I add the line 		$('select[name=inverter_manufacturer_publicly_traded]').change(); ..... it's suppose to hide the fields according to line 3..but it does not
[15:58:01] <robertmaxrees> it does for me.
[15:58:09] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of a weird way to do this.
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> also: you're defaulting to the 'No' option, whose value is 0.
[15:59:39] <vacho> basically, if the first dropdown is "Yes", it should hide the fields, if the first dropdown is "No", it should show the fields.
[15:59:59] <vacho> yes, since it's "No", it should show the fields...but it's currently hiding them instead of showing them
[16:01:02] <robertmaxrees> sec
[16:01:16] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask - why do this after pageload?
[16:01:18] <vacho> robertmaxrees: cleaned it up  https://jsfiddle.net/sjso3zhu/1/
[16:01:54] <vacho> robertmaxrees: Maybe I am going about this wrong. When should I do this?
[16:02:05] <robertmaxrees> server-side.
[16:02:27] <vacho> robertmaxrees: I feel it's cleaner to do with javascript, so all the hide/show is always on JS end
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[16:02:45] <robertmaxrees> the default state of the page should be what gets sent out.
[16:02:58] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're relying on JS to finish running and changing the page around.
[16:03:03] <robertmaxrees> which causes strange bugs.
[16:03:25] <Whiskey> I think i talked whit you yesterday robertmaxrees about, https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/3/ the problem is that after line 54 it read the text as html and not escape it whit makes in error
[16:04:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:05:35] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: whats fun whit it
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey let's approach this from another angle.
[16:26:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the error you're getting?
[16:28:51] <Whiskey> the problem is
[16:28:58] <robertmaxrees> not the problem.
[16:28:59] <robertmaxrees> the error.
[16:29:15] <Whiskey> click on, try an example.
[16:29:23] <Whiskey> its "unterminated string literal"
[16:29:41] <Whiskey> it read the text as html, witch make some unescpaed stuff errors like <script> in that example
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure that's not what's going on.
[16:30:17] <Whiskey> remove it an everything else works
[16:30:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting errors about an invalig regex flag.
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> *invalid
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> which will likely cause other issues.
[16:30:53] <Whiskey> problem is, $result.html(resultToHTML(test, result, regex));
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> const matchHTML = test.replace(regex, '<span class="match">$&</span>');
[16:31:03] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue.
[16:31:13] <Whiskey> igm is valud flags
[16:31:24] <Whiskey> yeh i know it is
[16:31:41] <Whiskey> test is not escaped
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> bruh
[16:31:55] <Whiskey> and can´t be at that place
[16:31:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a string.  you're conflating things.
[16:32:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to escape it.
[16:32:30] <Whiskey> but if i do it works
[16:32:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> it's a string already.
[16:33:00] <Whiskey> so why does it errror then and why just <script>
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> sec
[16:39:48] <Whiskey> :P
[16:40:16] <robertmaxrees> it's getting tripped up with the way you're passing data in.
[16:40:26] <Whiskey> :/
[16:40:46] <Whiskey> maybe not the best way
[16:40:46] <robertmaxrees> the issue is if you escape the markup, you're fundamentally changing what the user is searching against, which is going to cause you bigger problems.
[16:40:56] <Whiskey> exactly
[16:45:31] <robertmaxrees> now
[16:45:44] <robertmaxrees> wwoops wrong window.
[16:45:46] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:45:53] <Whiskey> :P
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so.
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> your issue isn't the html.
[16:50:23] <robertmaxrees> it's jQuery()
[16:50:29] <Whiskey> oo
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> parenthesis have special meaning in JS.
[16:50:42] <robertmaxrees> err, regexp
[16:53:00] <Whiskey> but it still has to be escaped?
[16:53:43] <robertmaxrees> "<script>" doesn't
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> there's a lesson to be learned here, though.
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> is the idea to teach people how to properly use regex?
[16:54:19] <Whiskey> script = jQuery "<script>" .prop { <- give you the same error
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> see above question
[16:54:37] <sillyslux> lol
[16:54:59] <robertmaxrees> because if so, then you want to notify people in these cases that the input string is poorly formatted.
[16:55:16] <robertmaxrees> and that they need to escape certain chars
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't transparently fix that yourself.
[16:55:35] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise your tool does something different than what the code would do.
[16:56:03] <Whiskey> not sure i fallow
[16:56:21] <robertmaxrees> you're building this so people can test js regex, right?
[16:56:44] <Whiskey> oo
[16:56:48] <Whiskey> the problem is the regexp itself
[16:56:54] <Whiskey> yeh
[16:56:56] <robertmaxrees> the problem is the input string.
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> not regexp.
[16:57:03] <Whiskey> script works fine :D
[16:57:18] <robertmaxrees> so you tell the user "hey, your data is invalid" and then tell them what they need to do.
[16:58:01] <Whiskey> best test string don´t have to be escaped
[16:58:10] <Whiskey> and "jQuery" should not need to be escaped ether
[16:58:23] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:58:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't do that part yourself.
[16:58:29] <robertmaxrees> the user does.
[16:58:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise your tool isn't using javascript regex.
[16:58:42] <robertmaxrees> but a subset
[16:59:27] <Whiskey> i don´t see how a test string has to do whit it, its like it execute something that don´t has to be
[16:59:34] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:59:43] <robertmaxrees> because the test string isn't in the proper format for JS regex.
[17:00:02] <robertmaxrees> if your tool is for playing with JS regex, then you have to bubble that error up to the user and tell them their input is bad.
[17:00:27] <Whiskey> i don´t fallow
[17:00:46] <Whiskey> match "jQuery", input: "script = jQuery( "<script>" ).prop( {" how can that be bad
[17:00:48] <robertmaxrees> the point of the tool is to play around with javascript regex, correct?
[17:01:01] <Whiskey> any regex
[17:01:06] <robertmaxrees> no
[17:01:10] <robertmaxrees> there's no "any regex"
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> gotta pick one.
[17:01:29] <robertmaxrees> or at least make it clear which one they're about to use.
[17:01:32] <robertmaxrees> they're all different.
[17:01:35] <Whiskey> but yes it use the javascripts regexp to match
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> the subheading there is "a JavaScript regular expression editor "
[17:02:06] <Whiskey> and work after that, and not rubular for an example as them work diffrently
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> if you start magically escaping input for them, it's no longer "a JavaScript regular expression editor "
[17:02:36] <Whiskey> ffs
[17:02:45] <Whiskey> so you mean, "script = jQuery( "<script>" ).prop( {" can´t match it
[17:02:46] <Whiskey> as it not valid
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> it's not valid regex input.
[17:03:14] <Whiskey> got it
[17:03:53] <Whiskey> i would still prefere away to escape it, so it possible to match
[17:04:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:04:09] <robertmaxrees> then you need to change the name.
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> because it's no longer js regex.
[17:04:26] <Whiskey> I do get that, but its not the main problem here
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> yes it is heh
[17:04:41] <robertmaxrees> you're expecting to treat invalid input as magically valid.
[17:05:15] <Whiskey> and it would still apply to javascript, as it would not match any other regexp tool magcal i think
[17:05:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:05:25] <robertmaxrees> it wouldn't.
[17:05:27] <Whiskey> as its still many parts thats not work that it does in others, like php or rubular
[17:05:35] <Whiskey> as its still many parts thats not work that it does in others, like php or ruby
[17:05:38] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter.
[17:06:04] <robertmaxrees> and if other tools ARE doing that with js regex, they need to change.
[17:06:20] <Whiskey> its just add an option
[17:06:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[17:06:26] <Whiskey> ignore js string errors
[17:06:30] <Whiskey> whatever
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> it's changing the kind of regex you're using.
[17:06:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you are deliberately misleading users.
[17:07:00] <Whiskey> well, its can still be for good use, as you can use javascript for other regex same as rubular or any other
[17:07:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:07:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:07:14] <robertmaxrees> it's no longer js regex.
[17:07:29] <robertmaxrees> nothing you say changes that.
[17:10:11] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/9/ <-- something like that
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> so who would this be useful to?
[17:10:52] <Whiskey> as i told, if you use it for other stuff then js
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> and why does it still say javascript?
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> what other stuff uses that kind of regex?
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> not familiar with any
[17:11:17] <Whiskey> well i can use it for tcl as an example
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> you can?
[17:11:34] <Whiskey> yes
[17:11:42] <robertmaxrees> they use js regex minus needing you to escape certain chars?
[17:12:20] <Whiskey> i don´t think so, i don´t know what they run but it work to build up in, and just copy over
[17:12:20] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it.
[17:12:22] <Whiskey> whats your point here
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> your tool's name is misleading.
[17:12:42] <robertmaxrees> it's no longer a javascript regex tool.
[17:12:51] <ngharo> who cares
[17:12:54] <Whiskey> i get your point
[17:13:31] <Whiskey> I don´t get it, if i load https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/10/
[17:13:50] <Whiskey> <label>Ignore something<input checked="checked" id="ignore" name="ignore" type="checkbox" value="0" /></label> <- is marked how do i get it unmarked
[17:13:52] <robertmaxrees> i care because somebody uses it, wonders why their stuff doesn't work in their app but does on some random tool, and then wastes their time trying to figure out wtf
[17:13:55] <Whiskey> is not that wat value is for?
[17:14:32] <robertmaxrees> what line in your js Whiskey?
[17:14:38] <Whiskey> its not js its html
[17:14:46] <Whiskey> line 35
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> you mean how do you not have the checkbox marked by default?
[17:15:35] <Whiskey> yeh
[17:15:41] <robertmaxrees> removed checked="checked"
[17:16:02] <Whiskey> let see if this makes your more happy w8 :D
[17:16:11] <robertmaxrees> it won't heh
[17:16:25] <robertmaxrees> but you never really listen to my advice so i give up.
[17:16:26] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[17:16:45] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: i try to thats why i try to do what i do now
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:16:59] <robertmaxrees> you're ignoring my advice.  it's all good duder.
[17:17:00] <robertmaxrees> you do you.
[17:18:00] <Whiskey> No i don´t you will see :D
[17:18:17] <robertmaxrees> you're going to add a checkbox and something else to try to impress me or make me ok with it.
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[17:18:22] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about it.
[17:22:45] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: what about https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/11/ ?
[17:22:55] <Whiskey> click on the checkbox
[17:26:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:26:50] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder
[17:26:57] <ngharo> robert is going to need some whiskey me thinks :P
[17:26:58] <Whiskey> you don´t like it?
[17:27:23] <robertmaxrees> i already told you i don't care.  it's still not a regex editor.  not sure what part of that is vague.
[17:27:44] <sadf> Hi everyone
[17:28:00] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees; if its not a regex editor what is it?
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:28:32] <robertmaxrees> it's implementing some unknown spec.  not sure what the utility in that is.
[17:29:43] <sadf> I have these slide menu where the icon changes to x when it's clicked.. My problem is when I click info it turns into x but then when I click the mail while the info is x it doesn't deactivate.. it stays x (vice versa / same for the mail)
[17:29:52] <sadf> Here's a link to the problem https://jsfiddle.net/d0s3wg5b/1/
[17:30:30] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: http://ideone.com/RqYujo
[17:30:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:30:43] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[17:31:27] <sadf> this slide*
[17:31:28] <robertmaxrees> sadf huh?  i'm not getting that behavior...
[17:31:41] <robertmaxrees> when i click the mail icon the sidebar closes.
[17:31:43] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: i don´t see why you don´t like to help when i tell you what i use it for
[17:31:53] <brezimenko> Hi, i'm back. The error successfully resolved, but the problem persists (www.petrol.si/nes on EDGE, IE) although i see no immediate problems.
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> i did help. i told you where the error was.
[17:32:17] <Whiskey> yeh i allredy know it has to be escaped to work the way i like
[17:32:25] <Whiskey> i have no clue how to do it proper
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> tell the user their input string is invalid.
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[17:32:52] <sadf> robertmaxrees try clicking the info ( it turns into x right?) now while it's x click the mail.. now they're both x and I wanna fix that but i'm not sure how
[17:33:10] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: but its crazy if you use it like i do
[17:33:10] <robertmaxrees> sadf it closes the menu when i click the mail icon >.>
[17:33:17] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey huh?
[17:33:37] <sadf> Well yea that's another problem robermaxrees
[17:33:39] <Whiskey> and copy lets say a script, and will search after something, and you get errors for nothing and need to find a what to escape "manually" just to search
[17:33:42] <sadf> robertmaxrees
[17:33:51] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey yep.
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> brezimenko it's a css issue it looks like.
[17:34:07] <robertmaxrees> the plugin is running fine.
[17:35:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd start by valiudating your markup.
[17:36:11] <robertmaxrees> sadf $(this).toggleClass('fa-times'); in that click handler.
[17:36:49] <Whiskey> i give uo, seems like you care more about what your self think
[17:36:54] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey lol
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm just giving you advice duder.  you can choose to ignore it.
[17:37:39] <robertmaxrees> sadf https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d0s3wg5b/2/
[17:37:44] <robertmaxrees> it's that toggleclass
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> for the sliding stuff.
[17:37:54] <ngharo> Whiskey: I think it's perfectly OK (more like you should be) escaping the test string when outputting it to the page
[17:37:54] <Whiskey> i don´t know how to apply it that way as i allredy told
[17:38:02] <ngharo> but not escaping when testing the regex
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're just targeting the wrong things
[17:38:29] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey you never said that.  you rejected the suggestion outright and then argued about it.
[17:38:30] <Whiskey> ngharo, no you don´t do that anywhere
[17:38:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:38:43] <Whiskey> ngharo: and hopfolly you know that when you test it
[17:39:04] <Whiskey> umm robertmaxrees, i thinked i did
[17:39:06] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey you're building a tool that misleads people.  and if TCL is so much better for this, why not just use that?
[17:39:07] <sadf> robertmaxrees hm but i need to open the slide menu for the mail so disabling it is not fine
[17:39:15] <brezimenko> will delve into that direction, thanks.
[17:39:16] <robertmaxrees> sadako huh?
[17:39:26] <robertmaxrees> err, sadf
[17:39:27] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees, first of all im the only user of it :)
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> brezimenko there's a #css fwiw
[17:39:48] <robertmaxrees> they may be able to help.
[17:40:04] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey (shrug) just pointing it out.  kind of a salient point.
[17:40:55] <Whiskey> why i try to made it was that i love rubular when i try my regex
[17:41:09] <Whiskey> and i would like to save it in my own database, insted of keep track of saved links
[17:41:26] <Whiskey> as rubular don´t offer any login to see what stuff you saved
[17:42:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about what you're saving.
[17:42:37] <robertmaxrees> and what you're using it for.
[17:43:01] <Whiskey> i use it for try tcl regxps
[17:43:13] <robertmaxrees> but it's not tcl regex
[17:43:19] <robertmaxrees> it's modified js regexp
[17:43:24] <Whiskey> i do know that
[17:43:32] <Whiskey> But what the hell does that matter if its still work for both languages?
[17:43:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:43:43] <robertmaxrees> alright duder
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[17:43:53] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: why do you make problems that don´t exist?
[17:44:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm not making a problem.  but it's all good.
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> if it's useful to you, knock yourself out.
[17:44:11] <Whiskey> You question everything i do
[17:44:33] <robertmaxrees> hey alright.  if you have a concern, feel free to PM me and we can talk about it :)
[17:44:35] <Whiskey> I have use rubular for 8 years to test regexps for tcl i have not get any problem whit it !yet"
[17:44:52] <Whiskey> And no, rubular is not for tcl its for ruby
[17:45:00] <Whiskey> and no JavaScript is not for TCL its for JavaScript
[17:45:05] <robertmaxrees> drop it or pm me.
[17:45:06] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[17:45:16] <Whiskey> but guss, it works whit both as long you don´t use any "language spcefic" options
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[18:40:29] <GoSox> hi
[18:40:41] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[18:41:11] <GoSox> if i'm using a $.post( ) call, it appears that .fail( ) and .done( ) both wait for the request to be done, but it looks like .always( ) is getting called right away. Is that how this is suppsoed to work?
[18:41:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:41:48] <robertmaxrees> always should run after the request finishes.
[18:42:01] <GoSox> hmm then what was going on
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> are those failure cases?
[18:42:53] <GoSox> nope they were success cases. i made other changes, let me set it up that way again with always( ) and see what happens now
[18:44:43] <GoSox> ok nows its functioning the way its supposed to, with always( ) waiting for the request to complete. I'm confused but its working so thats all that matters i guess
[18:45:10] <robertmaxrees> what were you doing before?
[18:45:14] <robertmaxrees> when it was running immediately.
[18:46:04] <GoSox> i thought this. i thought the only change i made was related to changing css, nothing that would affect function
[18:46:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you did.
[18:46:20] <GoSox> i don't have it
[18:46:49] <robertmaxrees> and you don't remember what you did?
[18:46:52] <GoSox> i tried to implement it, it wasn't waiting, so i switched to something else, got my progress bar gui working properly, then just came back to that and now its working properly too
[18:47:11] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:49:08] <GoSox> yeah its working fantastic now, oh well thanks anyway :P
