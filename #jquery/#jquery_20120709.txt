[00:01:27] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/rPa5B/
[00:03:02] <tw2113> not enough a's in fabulous
[00:03:26] <LoneStar99> codeAssassin: ok sweet! thanks, will mess with code in 10 rb
[00:03:28] <LoneStar99> brb
[00:03:42] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: np
[00:17:28] * coldhead np: mogwai fear satan - mogwai
[00:26:15] <LoneStar99> codeAssassin: what if the label for name is dynamic?
[00:26:35] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: then make it dynamic
[00:27:48] <LoneStar99> k
[00:28:29] <LoneStar99> how do i listen for a click?  not knowing the name?
[00:28:35] <LoneStar99> can't seem to find my code...
[00:29:05] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 how do you mean not knowing the name?
[00:30:25] <LoneStar99> BinaryKitten: yeah not knowing the name
[00:30:52] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 "how do you mean" means elabourate
[00:31:04] <BinaryKitten> as without more information we can't figure out what you mean
[00:32:19] <Cork> heh lovely, missed your response :)
[00:32:53] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: jquery doesn't actually work without giving it some conditions. So if you use php or some similar scripting language you can just generate a piece of javascript that matches a certain element
[00:33:29] <codeAssassin> or you can make it ambiguous like $('label').each( and just iterate through all the labels
[00:33:57] <LoneStar99> hmmm.. ok let me test something
[00:34:10] <BinaryKitten> but in the end LoneStar99 we're all just going to give you random information as we can't help without knowing the situation better
[00:37:23] <LoneStar99> BinaryKitten:  let me work on this abit more, will get back to you all in abit
[00:39:32] <LoneStar99> this is what i have to do for a f-cking phone interview... and not a sure thing... http://pastebin.com/gWh7jXkJ
[00:41:10] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: this is for a job interview?
[00:41:28] <LoneStar99> html5, css, jquery, php .... yeah
[00:41:29] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 oh
[00:41:34] <BinaryKitten> use a fieldset
[00:41:44] <BinaryKitten> style that so that it becomes the "title"
[00:41:59] <BinaryKitten> have it slide to a height
[00:42:12] <BinaryKitten> the rest should be easy
[00:42:20] <LoneStar99> can get everyting working but, never have worked with onclicks of labels
[00:43:01] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 it doesn't mention clicking lables
[00:43:05] <codeAssassin> listen to what BinaryKitten said, just use a fieldset and set the onclick to the legend elements
[00:43:18] <Eviltwin> Labels, when clicked, trigger a click on the corresponding input
[00:43:31] <Eviltwin> This has burned me before
[00:43:47] <codeAssassin> lol Eviltwin is that true? i never heard of that before lol
[00:44:01] <codeAssassin> is that true in all browsers?
[00:44:07] <LoneStar99> ok let me look into fieldset
[00:44:50] <Eviltwin> codeAssassin: As far as I know
[00:44:51] <Eviltwin> It's spec
[00:45:01] <codeAssassin> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/rPa5B/1/
[00:45:08] <LoneStar99> is fieldset a plugin?
[00:45:42] <codeAssassin> <fieldset><legend>something</legend></fieldset>
[00:45:51] <BinaryKitten> LoneStar99 no it's pure html
[00:45:59] <codeAssassin> maybe you should do some tutorials on html before applying though
[00:46:11] * BinaryKitten wonders why she's helping someone pass this test
[00:46:45] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I access the attributes inside this object? [div#1.item] This is what I see in the firebug console
[00:46:50] <codeAssassin> Eviltwin: doesn't actually do what you suggested. or i'm doing it wrong lol
[00:46:51] <LoneStar99> ok let me check that out
[00:47:02] <BinaryKitten> Mohsen_Hassani define "object" please
[00:47:23] <BinaryKitten> codeAssassin it doesn't trigger a click in jquery event terms
[00:47:31] <BinaryKitten> also
[00:47:41] <BinaryKitten> codeAssassin your labels are linked wrongly
[00:47:50] <BinaryKitten> for="id_of_input_elem"
[00:47:58] <codeAssassin> BinaryKitten: lol
[00:48:00] <Hereisanotherlie> BinaryKitten: get me a job too
[00:48:15] <Mohsen_Hassani> BinaryKitten, I have console.log(args) this args is a parameter which is passed to a functions that I don't know about... It's actually a slide show widget which I have downloaded
[00:48:19] <Stoob> I've already got two jobs, you guys can take em both
[00:48:26] <Eviltwin> codeAssassin: http://jsfiddle.net/rPa5B/2/
[00:48:28] <Eviltwin> Click "bar"
[00:48:37] <LoneStar99> ok you are right it mentions nothing about clicking label...
[00:48:58] <Hereisanotherlie> LoneStar99: if you can't do this too easily you probably should be looking for a lower level job
[00:49:11] <Hereisanotherlie> just my 2 cents
[00:49:16] <Mohsen_Hassani> BinaryKitten, using args.currentSlideObject it returns [div#1.item], I need to access the attributes inside this [div#1.item]
[00:49:32] <BinaryKitten> Mohsen_Hassani ok
[00:49:36] <codeAssassin> Eviltwin: that just means the label extends the onclick lol
[00:49:37] <BinaryKitten> what is "this" ?
[00:49:53] <codeAssassin> Eviltwin: i knew that, i was just confused nvm
[00:50:09] <Mohsen_Hassani> BinaryKitten, no, I didn't mean the real 'this' , I was pointing to [div#1.item], like this, that:))
[00:50:38] <BinaryKitten> Mohsen_Hassani
[00:50:43] <BinaryKitten> i was asking a question
[00:50:43] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie:  not really that, it is the wording, everytime i read the sh-t i think it means something else
[00:50:55] <BinaryKitten> what is the "this" in that function
[00:51:23] <codeAssassin> Mohsen_Hassani: $('div#1 > .item').attr() works fine
[00:51:49] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie: whatdo you estimate it should take to do everything "css, html5, php" etc??
[00:51:50] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[00:51:53] <BinaryKitten> codeAssassin where did you pluck the selector from?
[00:51:54] <thinkerweb> I am trying to use variables inside a .css() method.  This what I have but doesn't seem to work: $("#center").css("background-image", "'url(images/' + frame + '-FR-spots-' + noOfLettersInFrame  + '.jpg)'");
[00:52:06] <codeAssassin> BinaryKitten: from his original question lol
[00:52:23] <BinaryKitten> div#1.item?
[00:52:24] <Eviltwin> codeAssassin: The "label extends the onclick"?
[00:52:26] <bnb_dev> I am using jquery ui autocomplete with optgroup
[00:52:35] <Eviltwin> codeAssassin: Look at this bubble pattern: http://jsfiddle.net/MQanf/
[00:52:40] <Eviltwin> It's actually two separate click events
[00:52:45] <Hereisanotherlie> LoneStar99: I would say no more than maybe 30 - 45 minutes max realistically and that is a generous time frame
[00:52:48] <BinaryKitten> div#1.item != div#1 > .item
[00:53:00] <BinaryKitten> that's a div with an id and a class
[00:53:03] <bnb_dev> it's working fine, but I also want it work like that http://awesomescreenshot.com/0229zvu1a
[00:53:09] <bnb_dev> how i do that?
[00:53:43] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev
[00:53:48] <BinaryKitten> look up placeholder
[00:53:51] <bnb_dev> that is the code that I am using for auto complete http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11039814/jquery-ui-autocomplete-combobox-with-categories
[00:53:51] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie:  damn, it has taken me a few hours... this is what i got so far --> http://ec2-23-20-5-74.compute-1.amazonaws.com/DZAP/
[00:54:07] <BinaryKitten> it's a new attribute that will do what you want (show and disappear)
[00:54:24] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev: it won't work on the older browsers but that's not a big thing
[00:54:30] <codeAssassin> BinaryKitten: you're right. just didnt get the full context
[00:54:41] <bnb_dev> BinaryKitten: placeholder?
[00:55:08] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev: yes  <input type="text" placeholder="sometext" />
[00:55:19] <raj> if I have $.ajax() without a callback, can someone modify it to create a callback?
[00:55:37] <codeAssassin> Eviltwin: hmm seems to make sense, you learn something new every day
[00:55:38] <BinaryKitten> raj define "someone" for me?
[00:55:49] <bnb_dev> BinaryKitten: do I use autocomplete methods ?
[00:55:53] <Eviltwin> raj: If you do like var foo=$.ajax(...);
[00:56:02] <Eviltwin> Then you can later do foo.done(function(response) { ... });
[00:56:02] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev for what?
[00:56:24] <raj> I meant end-user, malicious
[00:56:25] <raj> ly
[00:56:40] <Eviltwin> You know how you have the Web Inspector / Firebug?
[00:56:45] <Eviltwin> Which lets you poke at the content
[00:56:47] <bnb_dev> BinaryKitten: for placeholder, when it focus
[00:56:48] <Eviltwin> So do they :)
[00:56:50] <bnb_dev> ?
[00:56:59] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev no.. it's browser built in as part of html5
[00:57:09] <Eviltwin> So, yes
[00:57:23] <BinaryKitten> bnb_dev: just add the placeholder attribute to the input
[00:57:24] <Eviltwin> Assume that anything that JavaScript does could be changed by the end user
[00:57:32] <bnb_dev> Ok
[00:57:35] <bnb_dev> Thanks
[00:57:40] <Hereisanotherlie> LoneStar99: ah i see that's not what I had visioned at all
[00:57:41] <raj> ok, so if I return a response from the server, but don't have a callback in $.ajax(), they can just modify $.ajax to have the callback and see the response?
[00:58:05] <BinaryKitten> raj: i don't need to modify the js to see the response
[00:58:15] <BinaryKitten> it's listed in the network tab
[00:58:23] <thinkerweb> for changing background image you would use $("#mydiv").css("background", "url(path/to/image.png)"); but suppose you have something like: var myurl = "path/to/myimage.png"; then how would you use that variable inside the .css("background", $myurl); ?)
[00:58:25] <BinaryKitten> or on the console if i have xmlhttprequests logged
[00:58:26] <raj> oh, interesting, ok, then I'll modify the server code
[00:58:27] <raj> thanks
[00:58:35] <Hereisanotherlie> LoneStar99: good luck though. I honestly hope you get the job. Worst case scenario though, at least you learned a couple things along the way
[00:58:54] <Eviltwin> raj: Assume that any data the goes to the client (HTML, JavaScript, images, AJAX, etc)
[00:58:55] <BinaryKitten> thinkerweb: that would work apart from the lack of url()
[00:58:59] <Eviltwin> Can be read by the user
[00:59:25] <Eviltwin> And that they can send whatever they damn well in a request
[00:59:26] <BinaryKitten> thinkerweb: .css('background-image', 'url('+myurl+')');
[00:59:42] <raj> kk
[00:59:52] <raj> i'll be more weary
[01:00:06] <BinaryKitten> thinkerweb: always use background-image over background as you don't know what other settings are being changed .. (unless you do.. )
[01:00:53] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, thx
[01:01:14] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie: thanks,  will see what happens
[01:01:21] <Hereisanotherlie> LoneStar99: don't get disheartened I didn't realize they mentioned creating a theme
[01:01:48] <Hereisanotherlie> that should bring the total up to around 4 hours I would guess
[01:01:58] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie: yeah all sorts of bs...  lol
[01:02:08] <Hereisanotherlie> which is a shitty amount of time to expect someone to do a stupid test for a possible job
[01:02:18] <Eviltwin> raj: The end user can always play man-in-the-middle, changing the data you send to the browser however they like and changing the data your JavaScript tries to send back however they like
[01:02:45] <thinkerweb> It doesn't seem to work, maybe my mistake is something else I guess
[01:02:48] <LoneStar99> Hereisanotherlie: it is just for a possible phone interview... need to go back to west coast, stuck in texas...
[01:03:19] <thinkerweb> I have:  var myurl = "images/" + frame + "-FR-spots-" + noOfLettersInFrame  + ".jpg"; $("#center").css("background-image", 'url('+myurl+')'); Can you spot any errors in that?
[01:03:48] <BinaryKitten> i can't thinkerweb
[01:04:01] <raj> Eviltwin, wasn't there something about a user not being able to use a different javascript file from another domain?
[01:04:02] <BinaryKitten> is it that the image isn't changing?
[01:04:13] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, yep
[01:04:14] <raj> like, if they created their own
[01:04:23] <raj> on their own server
[01:04:25] <BinaryKitten> raj stop worrying about it
[01:04:37] <BinaryKitten> there is only so much you can do
[01:04:44] <Eviltwin> Users can't control what other users see
[01:04:48] <Eviltwin> But they can control what they see
[01:04:53] <raj> k
[01:05:00] <raj> thanks for the pep-talk :)
[01:05:05] <BinaryKitten> thinkerweb log out the url
[01:05:24] <rabbi1> is this correct way of checking the condition for input field ? if (($("#editTasks td input[type='radio']")) && ($("#editTasks td input[checked='checked']")))
[01:05:24] <BinaryKitten> oh and where is images folder located?
[01:05:38] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, ../images
[01:05:41] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 no
[01:05:51] <Eviltwin> rabbi1: if($(...)) is always true
[01:05:51] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, sorry, ./images, it is in the current directory
[01:06:09] <BinaryKitten> ok but relative to the web page?
[01:06:25] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, yep, but I will try to test it to see if that is the case
[01:07:25] <rabbi1> Eviltwin: yeah, getting true value always. how do i target a input of a tab element ?
[01:07:25] * BinaryKitten departs for office & work
[01:07:26] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, dude, you are correct, it is .png not .jpg, lol
[01:07:33] <thinkerweb> I had the url wrong
[01:07:37] <BinaryKitten> heh
[01:07:49] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, thx
[01:07:51] <BinaryKitten> you can't count the amount of times i've done that thinkerweb
[01:09:43] <rabbi1> any clue ?
[01:10:03] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, yeah, that is why programming is so crazy, cause of simple errors like that
[01:10:22] <tw2113> at least it's not .bmp
[01:10:32] <russinkungen> rabbi1, taget input of tab?
[01:11:17] <rabbi1> russinkungen: yes
[01:11:35] <Nece228> hello
[01:12:12] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, using variables inside .css() still isn't working though
[01:12:13] <Nece228> so i have a loop in which i output five text outputs
[01:12:23] <russinkungen> rabbi1, how would you css it?
[01:12:24] <Nece228> is there any way to loop only the first output?
[01:12:32] <Nece228> or to select it without looping
[01:12:41] <russinkungen> [0]?
[01:12:56] <tw2113> ^
[01:13:00] <tw2113> assuming you have an array
[01:13:25] <russinkungen> I'm assuming $() :)
[01:13:38] <rabbi1> russinkungen: <div id="tabs"><ul><li><a href="tabone"></a></li><li><a href="tabtwo"></a></li></ul></div><div id="tabone"></div><div id="tabtwo"></div></div>
[01:14:07] <rabbi1> i have to target the input inside the tabtwo and find for checked = checked or not.....
[01:14:29] <Nece228> well i have json output
[01:14:36] <Nece228> i need to interact with data
[01:14:44] <Nece228> but data[0] outputs object
[01:15:05] <Stoob> then data[0] is an object
[01:15:19] <russinkungen> yeah sorry, just awoke here.
[01:15:21] <russinkungen> :S
[01:15:37] <Nece228> seems like multidimensional arrays do work
[01:15:46] <Nece228> thanks for giving me hint
[01:16:12] <LoneStar99> ok get it working now need to get php sh-t --> http://ec2-23-20-5-74.compute-1.amazonaws.com/DZAP/
[01:19:12] <russinkungen> Nece228: var foo = data[0] && data[0][0] I guess. Not sure about 2d-array syntax in js.
[01:20:42] <russinkungen> rabbi1: So if you have id="tabone" and only want to css an input in this element, how would you go about? :)
[01:20:52] <Nece228> russinkungen: i found that data[0][1] works
[01:21:55] <thinkerweb> BinaryKitten, ok it works now, thx for your help my friend
[01:28:02] <russinkungen> Nece228: Just be wary of undefined values there.
[01:28:40] <russinkungen> or at least out-of-bounds-indices.
[01:29:41] <Nece228> russinkungen: well its gonna be static
[01:34:24] <rabbi1> russinkungen: i have just did this if ($(#editTasks input[checked='checked']"))
[01:34:42] <rabbi1> russinkungen: i have just did this if ($(#tabtwo input[checked='checked']"))
[01:35:58] <rabbi1> russinkungen: or this  if ($("#tabs div[id='tabtwo'] input[checked='checked']"))
[01:36:33] <rabbi1> but it's always true
[01:37:50] <russinkungen> "#tabtwo input:checked" is enough though. you'll get an array of elements back so you can always check the length of the array. 0 is false.
[01:38:02] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 use .length
[01:38:06] <russinkungen> $('#tabtwo input:checked').length
[01:38:07] <BinaryKitten> $(selector).length
[01:39:10] <rabbi1> length will just give me the number of input elements, so i have to set to 0 for x for my condition .. right ?
[01:39:33] <rabbi1> russinkungen: sure
[01:39:42] <BinaryKitten> .length give you the amount of items that matched the selector
[01:40:01] <BinaryKitten> if you do the :checked then that automatically filters out those that are not checked
[01:40:04] <russinkungen> well if you use :checked in the selector you'll only get the elements that are checked. if there are no checked inputs, you'll get .length === 0.
[01:41:22] <rabbi1> so lenght should be used ?
[01:41:27] <russinkungen> yarr
[01:43:13] <reecefowell> seems like there is an issue in Safari 5.1, whenever a button is clicked, selected text is lost. Is anyone else noticing this issue?
[01:43:26] <rabbi1> russinkungen: if (($("#tabs div[id='tabtwo'] input:checked").length) != 0 )   :)
[01:44:20] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: russinkungen: thank you .... that should be okay as i can only target div id with #tabs ...
[01:44:47] <LoneStar99> can you tell me what is the best way to send the values of this form in array form or each form input named individually?
[01:46:31] <russinkungen> rabbi1: you're welcome. :)
[01:48:09] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: as an array
[01:48:21] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: like something[]
[01:48:41] <codeAssassin> php makes it real easy to read something like that
[01:49:13] <LoneStar99> ok
[01:49:49] <LoneStar99> what if I am sending it via ajax post don't element ids have to be unique?
[01:51:09] <codeAssassin> but LoneStar99, i would recommend you doing some research of you're own
[01:51:33] <codeAssassin> id's have to be unique yes, but that has nothing to do with array form elements
[01:51:53] <codeAssassin> when posting data, you use the name attribute
[01:52:08] <codeAssassin> which can be in an array format
[01:52:25] <LoneStar99> ok that was my question will change my code into array format
[01:52:29] <LoneStar99> thanks
[01:52:44] <codeAssassin> look up form serialize jquery ;)
[01:53:22] <LoneStar99> codeAssassin: yeah got it,  thanks
[02:01:58] <mink> Hello. How i can get element from array when i have string -> "small", "large".  Looks like this ->  http://jsfiddle.net/aAkCZ/   ?
[02:05:33] <codeAssassin> mink: console.log(constantDimensions.small);
[02:06:03] <LoneStar99> codeAssassin: ok serialize works great! thanks
[02:06:23] <LoneStar99> test it out --> http://ec2-23-20-5-74.compute-1.amazonaws.com/DZAP/
[02:06:26] <mink> codeAssassin, I try it but this not worked. I look at this again, thanks ;)
[02:07:40] <Ryguy> Anyone awake?
[02:07:52] <codeAssassin> mink: weird worked for me http://jsfiddle.net/aAkCZ/1/
[02:08:14] <Whirl3d_> I've been given an impossible task that I thought I would ask if anyone has any idea how to approach:  I am hoping to create a website that has about 5 sections and the simplest looking animation ever....It would look like it was drawn by hand in Ink on the screen without lifting the pen---one long stroke with 5 little doodles in the middle evenly spaced.
[02:08:34] <Ryguy> hmm
[02:08:34] <codeAssassin> LoneStar99: np man, good luck
[02:08:37] <mink> codeAssassin, I think it's my bad ;)   thanks for help
[02:08:48] <Ryguy> Whirl3d_: Css image masks with css animations?
[02:08:57] <Whirl3d_> But when you cclick on one of these damned doodles, the line that makes them streches out and flat and the content appears
[02:09:18] <Whirl3d_> I am95% sure it's gonna require canvas
[02:09:37] <Ryguy> Are you animationg with JS?
[02:09:40] <Cork> Whirl3d_: border-image should like a fairly good fit
[02:09:41] <Whirl3d_> I was looking at three.js or another engine like that...
[02:09:59] <Cork> should==sound
[02:10:07] <Whirl3d_> border-image....loooking it up now
[02:10:47] <Whirl3d_> she wants it to look like an elastic string that when a section is clicked, it pulls tight right there
[02:11:40] <Whirl3d_> processing? or paper mabe?
[02:12:25] <Whirl3d_> http://paperjs.org/
[02:12:43] <Ryguy> soo it draws the line a bit, then draws a doodle, and repeats 4 more times? then when you hover, the line pulls tight?
[02:13:31] <Whirl3d_> yeah. So if you aren't in section...it would kind of look like a string with little icons evenly spaced made oout of the string...
[02:13:42] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/cLXep/11/ - I'm trying to integrate the ultra-awesome Select2 http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/#tags - what am I missing though?
[02:13:45] <Whirl3d_> click on it and it unravels
[02:13:49] <Ryguy> I see
[02:14:01] <Ryguy> Going for browser compatibility?
[02:14:05] <mikkelb> Morning y'all
[02:14:21] <Whirl3d_> doubt it. It's for a really high end fitness group in NYC.
[02:14:30] <Whirl3d_> They prolly don't care.
[02:14:36] <Ryguy> Then definitely go for canvas.
[02:15:07] <Whirl3d_> if you look at paperjs.org, I think the chain thing is kinda like what she wants..
[02:15:15] <Ryguy> If not, just preload some gifs and set them as background-images and swap out the classs *shrug*
[02:15:25] <codeAssassin> god paper.js is awesome
[02:16:57] <Ryguy> I have a quick question - When creating a jQ plugin, how would I get the selector that got the result set that function is working with? Ex: ` $('p:first').myPlugin ` - how would I get "p:first"?
[02:17:29] <Whirl3d_> it's it
[02:17:51] <Whirl3d_> $.fn.myplugin=function () {this is the selector;;;;
[02:18:12] <Whirl3d_> wait, I'm sorry did you want the selector? or the jquery object
[02:18:29] <Ryguy> right the actual selector string
[02:18:51] <Whirl3d_> this.selector?  (it's something really simple like that. I'll look it up)
[02:19:57] <Mohsen_Hassani> Is there any fancy beautiful free jquery modal popup widgets to download?
[02:20:14] <Ryguy> Twitter Bootstrap has a nice modal
[02:20:25] <Ryguy> you can use only the modal, you dont need all the other JS extensions
[02:21:44] <Whirl3d_> ryguy, maybe .context
[02:22:23] <codeAssassin> Mohsen_Hassani: jquery ui
[02:22:39] <Ryguy> Apparently, it is `selector`. But I could only find it in the "dynamic" docs O_o
[02:23:21] <Ryguy> That is weird
[02:23:28] <Ryguy> But, it works.
[02:25:20] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/xXQUc/ mousemove click handler, for some reason when you mvoe the scroll bar to the bottom it sticks
[02:25:26] <nFFF> if (scrollable && ((0 <= sbSmall.position().top) && (sbSmall.position().top < (sbHeight - sbHandleHeight)))) // this is where it breaks
[02:25:46] <nFFF> For some reason sBsmall.positin().top is becoming more then (sbHeight - sbHandleHeight)
[02:25:50] <nFFF> when it clearly shouldnt
[02:26:31] <shoky> mikkelb: i think it's just missing the images
[02:26:35] <Whirl3d_> are you trying to make your own scrollbar?
[02:27:07] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, yea
[02:27:18] <nFFF> Well pretty much made it, just getting perfect
[02:28:14] <thinkerweb> can I chain .fadeIn with .css()?
[02:28:24] <Whirl3d_> I'll tell ya what, it ain't easy. I have tried for years now and I still ccan't get it 100% right....course I am really millitant about how a scrollbar should work. I'll look at your fiddle, but may not be much help. LOL
[02:29:05] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: yeah, or use the callback.
[02:29:20] <Ryguy> Yikes, I keep away from making scrollbars. I've been burned before >_<
[02:29:46] <thinkerweb> russinkungen, hmm, ok thx
[02:29:56] <thinkerweb> I tried this, but it didn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/HXe5Q/1/
[02:30:18] <shoky> mikkelb: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cLXep/13/  i just replaced the select2.css with one from a url that also has the images
[02:32:28] <shoky> thinkerweb: you have an extra dot
[02:32:58] <thinkerweb> shoky, thx, I must be blind
[02:33:26] <shoky> you must be if you didn't see the error in your console :P
[02:34:05] <thinkerweb> it doesn't work though still
[02:34:17] <thinkerweb> shoky, there is nothing else wrong with it?
[02:37:07] <thinkerweb> oh, fadeIn for animating opacity
[02:37:58] <nFFF> Whirl3d_, youve been trying for years? :o
[02:38:45] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: you want the background to fade in? set .css().fadeIn() instead.
[02:38:48] <russinkungen> also, url is relative.
[02:39:53] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: or else you'll fade in and then the backround pops in there.
[02:40:09] <Whirl3d_> Yeah, I think that a scrollbar thumb when clicked should reaveal a miniature of the element scrollable content with just the viewport height highlighted so you can scroll down and highlight just what you want.
[02:42:53] <thinkerweb> russinkungen, just the background image
[02:43:28] <shoky> nFFF: what's this part for? sbSmall.position().top < (sbHeight - sbHandleHeight)
[02:43:42] <shoky> oh
[02:43:43] <shoky> nvm
[02:45:09] <thinkerweb> russinkungen, I think I could do it using animate, but I'm not sure, this is what I tried but didn't work:http://jsfiddle.net/HXe5Q/5/
[02:47:54] <thinkerweb> http://jsfiddle.net/HXe5Q/7/
[02:51:10] <shoky> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xXQUc/1/
[02:52:09] <shoky> you were pushing the handle down too much
[02:54:06] <nFFF> Ah thanks
[02:54:15] <nFFF> I thought the first conditional would have stopped that
[02:54:28] <nFFF> I could see it was going down too much yb a pixel or so but couldnt work out how it was being allwoed to ahppen
[02:57:28] <nFFF> shoky, Ive added a little code to incorporate the position where they click on the handle
[02:57:28] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/xXQUc/2/
[02:57:33] <nFFF> but now it doesnt work perfect
[02:57:43] <nFFF> offsetHandle is the variable
[02:58:42] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: surround all css-properties containing a dash with quotes or you'll get a syntax error.
[02:59:49] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: it's not very good but: http://jsfiddle.net/HXe5Q/10/
[03:00:21] <Axsuul> Is there any way to say.. if $(this).attr('data-params-*')  , that is, if any attribute exists with data-params- as a prefix?
[03:01:03] <Axsuul> I guess I could use a regular expression
[03:01:06] <russinkungen> thinkerweb: or http://jsfiddle.net/HXe5Q/11/ if you don't mind stuff jumping around.
[03:01:42] <russinkungen> not sure if you want the div to use up the space even when not visible or if you just want it to appear.
[03:03:11] <thinkerweb> russinkungen, cool, thx
[03:04:53] <shoky> nFFF you need to modify the if that i added too
[03:06:05] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I change the place of this dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/AucBb/
[03:06:13] <nFFF> shoky yes just realised
[03:06:45] <shoky> nFFF and you also need to make sure you're not setting it to <0  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xXQUc/4/
[03:06:59] <shoky> and now you need to fix the handleOffset thing to work properly :P
[03:07:42] <shoky> what are you trying to do ?
[03:08:08] <nFFF> Seems to work now :D
[03:08:18] <shoky> my last fiddle?
[03:08:30] <nFFF> shoky, well basically with handleOffset it takes into account where on the handle the user clicks
[03:08:38] <nFFF> else it would be the top of the handle
[03:08:38] <shoky> what for?
[03:09:09] <shoky> in my last fiddle it doesnt work good
[03:09:11] <nFFF> becuase when you click the handle, it should activate the handle relative to where you clicked
[03:09:17] <nFFF> not the top of the handle
[03:09:24] <nFFF> otherwise it will use the handle's offset to the aprent
[03:09:27] <nFFF> which is the top
[03:09:43] <nFFF> your last fiddle works fine for me
[03:10:01] <shoky> look at the scrolled content relative to the scroll handle
[03:10:04] <shoky> its not fine
[03:10:27] <shoky> when you drag it up for example, you keep dragging and it scrolls up even tho the handle is already on the top
[03:10:43] <shoky> and the reverse effect when its on the bottom, the scroll finishes before you even reach the bottom
[03:11:05] <nFFF> not for me :\
[03:11:07] <Whirl3d_> I don't like how draggable works...
[03:11:20] <nFFF> ah wait
[03:11:23] <nFFF> I see what you mean
[03:13:13] <nFFF> shoky any idea why it does that?
[03:13:25] <shoky> nFFF because of the offset you added :P
[03:13:38] <nFFF> yes
[03:13:40] <nFFF> fixed it
[03:13:57] <nFFF> Just realsied scrollValue didnt include the hadnleOffset
[03:14:06] <nFFF> fuarking os many linked vairbales
[03:14:18] <nFFF> going to be one of these codes that will be hell to try and come back to in a month
[03:14:19] <nFFF> :D
[03:14:28] <shoky> yah, you should clean it up a bit ;P
[03:21:51] <Mohsen_Hassani> Why is this dialog pop up window going so bottom??? http://jsfiddle.net/AucBb/
[03:22:18] <Eiwaz> Hello, I have a question. Basically, I'm using jquery to load text from an xml file into a page. The xml file contains a link and i have defined a .load() function that has the preventDefault set for the link. But it doesn't work
[03:22:23] <Mohsen_Hassani> It's placing at the bottom of the page
[03:22:29] <Eiwaz> However, running the same function from browser console works
[03:22:42] <raj> is it really silly to $.post twice for the same 'click' to two different urls?
[03:23:15] <raj> instead of just making 1 post to a url that will do the job of both different urls
[03:23:21] <nFFF> well
[03:23:26] <nFFF> itd make sense to just do one
[03:23:32] <nFFF> requests are added overhead
[03:24:02] <raj> hmm, yeah
[03:24:10] <kostodo> Is there a way to look through a <select id="foo"> and remove certain <option>'s by their "value" attribute?
[03:24:22] <raj> it's just that I can really clean up my code by abstracting functions
[03:24:30] <raj> but then I'd need two posts
[03:24:57] <raj> because sometimes I need 1 or the other, but in one particular case, I need both functions
[03:25:12] <nFFF> then use two posts then
[03:25:27] <raj> cleaner code beats a single post?
[03:25:41] <nFFF> Well you just said some times you only need one set of data
[03:25:56] <nFFF> so your either going to have overhead of one extra post requests sometimes
[03:26:04] <nFFF> or the other times oyur going to eb retrieving data you dont need
[03:26:57] <raj> No, the big function (combining both posts) is defined separately from the functions that break it up
[03:27:13] <Eiwaz> The best I could come up with is that .load() triggers before the data from xml has loaded... but that shouldn't be the case?
[03:27:17] <raj> I just felt silly repeating myself for the big function and thought maybe I should just call the two smaller functions separately with 2 posts
[03:28:30] <Jamal> I have a problem with jQuery UI Drag & Drop. In the following example, i want the boxes to fade in, if i drag&drop one into the green or red area. Problem is it only works the second time. Wehn i first drag&drop one, it stays at the drop position, but when i drag it again, it fits to the area. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/
[03:30:02] <Whirl3d_> oooh jsfiddle is being pissy today
[03:30:53] <raj> ya it is
[03:31:04] <raj> sometimes connecting to google I get an nginx welcome page
[03:31:06] <raj> so weird
[03:31:20] <raj> you in NY Whirl3d_?
[03:31:29] <Whirl3d_> oh that's that virus that's coming out today supposedly
[03:31:34] <Whirl3d_> lol
[03:31:51] <raj> the FBI servers that expired?
[03:31:54] <raj> whatever that's about
[03:33:41] <Jamal> yes jsfiddle is a little bit slow today, but it works :)
[03:33:47] <Whirl3d_> I wish I was in NY. Instead I am struggling down south in Atlanta. Where the only things worse than the omnipresent racial intolerance are the heat and the stupidity...
[03:34:18] <Whirl3d_> err. I mean humidity...yeah, that's what I mean...
[03:35:58] <Whirl3d_> I just realized that I have about 15 massive apps running right now. I need to quit outta some shit. Maybe that will speed up jsfiddle for everyone...
[03:40:16] <hemangpatel> www.example.com/id/1
[03:40:33] <hemangpatel> how can i get id from url ? answer : 1 :)
[03:41:23] <mink> hemangpatel, You want easy way or complicate way? :D
[03:41:41] <hemangpatel> mink : both way friend.
[03:42:42] <raj> lol @Whirl3d_
[03:42:43] <wavez> I'm new to this asyncronous stuff and I'm trying to get inline editing working with my jqGrid. I'm trying to figure out what will be sent to my 'cellurl'. Could someone give me a suggestion how I can do that? I'm searching the jqGrid docs.
[03:43:07] <wavez> I'm thinking I should make my 'cellurl' file just send the data it receives to console.log()
[03:43:12] <raj> ok, off to sleep fella's
[03:43:13] <raj> goodnight
[03:43:15] <wavez> but I'm not sure how to do that, since it's php
[03:43:47] <mink> hemangpatel,  You can put this value to div <div style="display:none;"><?php echo $id_value; ?></div>   and next step -> get div value with jquery
[03:43:50] <Whirl3d_> gnight raj
[03:43:51] <wavez> I'm thinking that my JS should have a function that the 'cellurl' file can call which will send the data to console.log().
[03:44:17] <mink> and it's simple and easy way (:
[03:44:22] <Whirl3d_> mink, wat?
[03:44:22] <ircjsbot> After search on the Internet for almost one day, FINALLY I have the best solution to do this: Resize a dive to full page size!! Thanks you great work!!!
[03:44:33] <hemangpatel> mink : can we get direct from url ?
[03:45:17] <Whirl3d_> ircjsbot, wat?
[03:45:17] <ircjsbot> Hey, there's the word java in javascript, so that should guarantee the performance, right?
[03:45:36] <Whirl3d_> troll much?
[03:46:23] <Whirl3d_> hermangpatel, where is the url coming from?
[03:47:21] <mink> Whirl3d_, or try trim url in js, but i don't know how you build urls
[03:48:41] <mink> hemangpatel, $(location).attr('href'); should be return current url
[03:48:48] <Whirl3d_> var id=url.substr(url.indexOf("id")+4);
[03:48:57] <Jamal> Thanks Whirl3d_ jsfiddle now loads much faster, haha
[03:49:12] <Whirl3d_> Thought it might be the case. LOL
[03:49:40] <wavez> How do I receive data from the cell editing features of jqGrid? http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:cell_editing#what_is_posted_to_the_server
[03:50:16] <Whirl3d_> wavez, so you don't think I'm ignoring you...I have no fucking clue how to use jqgrids, sorry.
[03:50:27] <wavez> hahah. Thanks Whirl3d_ :)
[03:51:09] <wavez> Whirl3d_, I know it send the data to the file I specify on my server, but I don't know what to do from there. No ideas?
[03:51:13] <wavez> *sends
[03:53:08] <mikkelb> shoky: sorry got disconnected
[03:53:11] <Whirl3d_> did you read comment 1 on the link you posted? LOL
[03:55:11] <wavez> Whirl3d_, ya, that part is discouraging. After seeing that, I started to think that maybe I should just write my own code to pop open a dialog for taking the input.
[03:56:33] <wavez> http://www.trirand.net/aspnetmvc/grid/editrowinline
[03:57:18] <jgomez> Hi. I'm getting "undeifned" for my input[name=keywords].val() with this code http://pastebin.com/QhtTpC1J
[03:57:28] <hemangpatel> Whirl3d_ : what is +4 in var id=url.substr(url.indexOf("id")+4);
[03:59:09] <nFFF> hemangpatel, it increases the index from 'id' 4 places...
[04:01:53] <Jamal> I have a problem with jQuery UI Drag & Drop. In the following example, i want the boxes to fade in, if i drag&drop one into the green or red area. Problem is it only works the second time. Wehn i first drag&drop one, it stays at the drop position, but when i drag it again, it fits to the area. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/
[04:03:34] <Whirl3d_> hemangpatel, it searches the url for the letters "id" and then adds 4 characters to that position...basically skipping the "/id/" part and giving you the rest of the url.   Like nFFF said. 8)
[04:05:49] <Whirl3d_> jgomez unless keywords is a variable name, it's probably not gonna work without ' '
[04:06:08] <Whirl3d_> and you will need to wrap it in jquery...
[04:06:22] <Whirl3d_> $("input[name='something']").val()
[04:06:53] <Cork> Whirl3d_: it is a variable :)
[04:07:21] <Cork> so $('input[name="' + keywords + '"]')
[04:07:59] <Whirl3d_> i didn't even see the pastebin
[04:08:00] <Whirl3d_> lol
[04:08:42] <aleminio> Hey guys, i'm sending an ajax request using $.ajax to a server which requires authorization, I looked into the documentation and it says that i can add username and password options if authorization is required, but when i do that, The call isn't being sent at all as if i typed something wrong, any ideas why is that happening?
[04:09:19] <Cork> aleminio: basic auth?
[04:10:16] <aleminio> yes
[04:11:22] <aleminio> if i'm not typing username\password, the response i'm getting is 401: Unauthorized
[04:11:40] <Cork> and your using beforeSend and xhr.setRequestHeader?
[04:11:42] <jgomez> Whirl3d_: So it would be $('input[name="keywords"]').val() ?
[04:11:44] <aleminio> if i do add username, it won't sent it at all
[04:12:32] <Whirl3d_> look how Cork did it.
[04:12:40] <Cork> jgomez: please show your html too, we have to guess at your structure as it is now
[04:13:02] <aleminio> No, i am actually not. i need to?
[04:13:15] <Cork> thats how you need to set the user and password yes
[04:14:14] <Whirl3d_> basically, think of everything in your selector as a string...so if you wan to put the value of the keywords variable in your selector for name=   you would do $("input[name=' "+keywords+"']");   though it might work without the single quotes...i'm not sure...
[04:15:19] <wavez> Guys, I need to figure out how to send data from my server back to the client and have the page update my jqGrid objects. How does that process work? What should I be searching for answers?
[04:15:52] <Cork> wavez: look for longpull, comet, or similar solutions
[04:16:07] <Cork> wavez: but the request has to start client side
[04:16:58] <wavez> Cork, I can write the code on the client side, but I don't know the process of getting it back from the server.
[04:17:14] <Cork> wavez: what do you mean?
[04:17:31] <Cork> how the server should format the response?
[04:18:04] <jgomez> Cork: Aha! Solved it :) I added a hidden input field in the form named "keywords" with the type "hidden"
[04:18:13] <jgomez> Cork: Thanks for making me think about the form!
[04:20:15] <wavez> Cork, maybe I should try a simple XMLHttpRequest tutorial
[04:20:37] <Cork> wavez: na, just check ajax
[04:21:00] <wavez> I'm probably getting ahead of myself. I have jqGrid working but I guess I'm not knowledgable enough at ajax yet to send data back and forth however I want.
[04:21:07] <Cork> wavez: a xhr or ajax call is just more or less a normal connection to the server, so just send your response
[04:23:11] <mikkelb> shoky: thanks a lot man

[04:35:58] <SoulRaven> because if i put the label after the check box is working, but if is before the checkbox then is not working
[04:35:59] <Test_> ?
[04:36:10] <Test_> Anyone .. has any idea
[04:36:11] <Test_> ?
[04:40:55] <codeAssassin> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/A29g2/1/
[04:41:25] <SoulRaven> codeAssassin: thx, but is not posibile using only css3?
[04:43:01] <codeAssassin> SoulRaven: i have no idea
[04:50:28] <shoky> SoulRaven: you use '+ label'
[04:50:37] <shoky> but the label is _before_ the checkbox
[04:50:47] <shoky> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/A29g2/2/
[04:51:03] <aleminio> I'm trying to add an Authorization header using both the header option and setRequestHeader of $.ajax but it still won't add Authorization to the header
[04:52:20] <codeAssassin> shoky: + means div + span = span preceded by div
[04:54:52] <shoky> codeAssassin: indeed.  in your case  + label means the label is preceded by the input
[04:55:44] <shoky> label is preceded by <-- means label is AFTER
[04:56:22] <shoky> codeAssassin i mean in SoulRaven's case
[04:59:43] <codeAssassin> shoky: correct ;), i just added an explanation
[05:00:15] <shoky> ya i thought you were him ;p
[05:00:43] <codeAssassin> shoky: i have no idea though why it doesn't work the other way around
[05:00:45] <codeAssassin> it baffles me
[05:01:01] <shoky> what way around?
[05:01:09] <shoky> in short, css doesn't back-track
[05:01:20] <shoky> you can only go in one direction
[05:01:26] <codeAssassin> label + checkbox, in that order
[05:01:34] <codeAssassin> yeah that doesn't make too much sense to me
[05:01:40] <shoky> that works fine for selecting the checkbox, not the label :P
[05:01:48] <codeAssassin> http://jsfiddle.net/A29g2/3/
[05:02:19] <codeAssassin> gotta do some actual work now, i think ill have to let this one go
[05:02:22] <shoky> codeAssassin it works
[05:02:28] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/A29g2/4/
[05:02:31] <mattyh88> hi, is it possible to fill in a value in a textbox (with autocomplete) that's not found in the databasetable?
[05:02:32] <SoulRaven> i quess because if the css is not backtrack in dom tree
[05:03:21] <SoulRaven> using the example above, the style is aplied to the cbeckbox, not the label
[05:03:26] <shoky> yep
[05:03:44] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: yes, there is an example in the jquery ui autocomplete docs
[05:03:51] <johnkpaul> you set the "source" option to an array
[05:04:35] <johnkpaul> actually, it's the default example, mattyh88 http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ click on view source
[05:07:12] <mattyh88> Johnkpaul: hm, wait how would that work? Let's say i type a value and it's listed in the dbTable. The record would be saved with an ID set. But if a value isn't found in the related table, then an ID can't possible be set?
[05:07:55] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: read the options for source
[05:08:03] <johnkpaul> you can give a custom function
[05:08:12] <johnkpaul> that first searches in the db, and if nothing come sback, provide your own values
[05:09:34] <mattyh88> yeh but still
[05:09:39] <mattyh88> how would that look like in the Db
[05:09:50] <mattyh88> i will need 2 fields really
[05:10:06] <mattyh88> "name" and "name_manual" or something
[05:10:19] <mattyh88> as "name" would be an integer field and "name_manual" a textfield
[05:14:17] <Jamal> Hey johnkpaul i still couldn't fix the jquery UI drag&drop problem :S could you help me again? i tried several possibilities but nothing worked for me
[05:15:09] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: I thought that the other options were _not_ from the db
[05:15:19] <johnkpaul> Jamal: can you send your up to date fiddle?
[05:15:42] <mattyh88> johnkpaul: yes that's right
[05:16:02] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: then what is the purpose of "name_manual"?
[05:16:36] <Jamal> johnkpaul: mh i have no new fiddle because nothing changed so i canceled everything
[05:17:19] <Jamal> still the same as yesterday: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/
[05:17:33] <mattyh88> to save the text value
[05:17:45] <mattyh88> because the "standard" field is an integer field
[05:18:15] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: oh, to save it
[05:18:26] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's a data integrity/backend question
[05:18:39] <johnkpaul> I agree with your concern, but jquery ui has no help for you there
[05:20:10] <mattyh88> kk :p
[05:22:07] <Jamal> what i don't understand is, while dragging the div, the position of the original div changes, but when i release it, it switches the position with the clone, why is it so? thats really strange
[05:23:27] <johnkpaul> Jamal: that makes snese, becuase you're animating the div, not the clone
[05:26:11] <Jamal> okay if i change ui.draggable to ui.helper it doesnt change anymore, but the fade problem still exists. i tried it yesterday with absolute values as you said, but that was really weird. with the absolute values you mean, to set the animation directly to the targeted div position, right?
[05:27:18] <johnkpaul> Jamal: yes
[05:29:11] <Jamal> but then the div faded somewhere on the page
[05:31:19] <Jamal> and it also only works the second time i drag it
[05:36:22] <greek> Hi fellas. I'm having a problem with a sortable list. I've got a click event bound to the individual list items which triggers just fine. However whenever I sort an element (click, drag, release), this click event is triggered too, which I don't want. Is there some way I can prevent this from happening? Thanks
[05:51:52] <greek> Is there a way to prevent a "click" event from executing from another event? For example, I click down and drag (which triggers event "drag") but when I let go to "drop", a click event is also triggered. I'd like to stop the "click" event from happening inside my "drag" event handlers. Is this possible?
[05:52:15] <Falcon`> event.stopPropagation()?
[05:59:22] <greek> Falcon`, thanks for the tip. I researched that and understand how it works. Not sure how I can apply it in my case. The click event I am trying to prevent from happening is being executed when I drop a sortable item (jquery-ui). So I'm not sure how to "get inside" the sorting event handler in order to prevent the click's propagation. Does that make sense?
[06:01:37] <aleminio> Why when i use setRequestHeader, it adds it as Access-Control-Allow-Header when the parameter i've chosen becomes the value? how can i bypass it and send it as a header right away?
[06:03:31] <johnkpaul> aleminio: is this a cross origin request?
[06:04:25] <squeakita> is it possible to have 2 submit buttons, one triggers validation and one does not trigger validation, but will submit the form?
[06:05:55] <Falcon`> greek: unfortunately no, it doesn't. drag and drop events are, in a way, artificiial, while click is supported natively by browser. It'd be possible i guess to cancel drag/drop events, but not click
[06:06:29] <Falcon`> assuming your click is called after drag event, you can just set there some variable that drag event was called
[06:06:33] <Falcon`> and check it inside click handler
[06:06:39] <Falcon`> i see no other way around that
[06:07:02] <greek> Falcon`, ok thanks. It's not a train smash, I can simply re-design the interface so that the object being drag/dropped is accompanied by a link that, when clicked, opens up my little preview window (the purpose of the click event)
[06:07:25] <greek> I was trying to be clever by having the object both draggable and clickable ;)
[06:07:40] <Falcon`> it should be possible to do
[06:07:55] <Falcon`> but i'm not sure how anymore, long time since i used jquery ui last time
[06:08:34] <aleminio> john, it's the same adress
[06:09:22] <greek> Falcon`, you might find this interesting: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771627/preventing-click-event-with-jquery-drag-and-drop
[06:09:28] <greek> thanks for all your help :)
[06:09:40] <Falcon`> np, thanks for the link
[06:13:11] <macro22> Are there any known bugs with Jquery UI tabs (1.8.21) within colorbox style modals?
[06:13:40] <macro22> all of my jquery ui elements work fine other than tabs, and I have scoured the internet, but im including the css correctly, and the markup is in the right hierarchy
[06:14:17] <macro22> it even gets the class "ui-tabs" applied to the containing div as well as the widget styles etc
[06:14:18] <Cork> macro22: inspect the css rules for the tab elements
[06:14:25] <Cork> it should show you what happens
[06:14:38] <macro22> I have done but truth be told I dont know what I should be looking for the styles seem to be applied
[06:14:59] <Cork> macro22: crossed over rules
[06:15:25] <macro22> Though that may be the case but there seems to be nothing that is interfering, in firebug I can turn off all other styles
[06:15:33] <macro22> and it doesnt change it really
[06:15:51] <Cork> you have a link?
[06:15:54] <macro22> problem is I cannot really replicate it on jsfiddle as its all dynamically loaded via knockoutjs
[06:16:24] <macro22> sure one mo
[06:16:29] <macro22> the live system has the same issue
[06:17:13] <macro22> http://d20tools.com/dnd4ed/character
[06:17:19] <macro22> go there and click on the little note icon at the top
[06:17:41] <macro22> it *should* open a colorbox modal with tabs within each tab containing the textarea
[06:17:52] <macro22> but it just dumps it as is, but you can see partial styles are being applied
[06:18:16] <macro22> and other jquery ui elements are working fine (I think I am only really using buttons elsewhere)
[06:22:11] <macro22> the *only* thing I could think that would cause it, would be because not all elements were full loaded in the DOM, but as I am using knockoutJS I have got it to only apply the tab effect once the elements are loaded (As its all loaded in via an external template)
[06:28:01] <jasabella> hi
[06:28:31] <hooloovoo> o/
[06:28:39] <conlinism> Hello
[06:30:56] <conlinism> Can anybody help me?
[06:31:05] <oal> I'm looking for a <select> replacement jQuery plugin where I can add an icon (16x16 or so) to each <option>, and allows multiple selections. Suggestions?
[06:31:32] <bot-t> conlinism, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:31:57] <cusco> hi
[06:32:12] <macro22> Any ideas Cork?
[06:32:13] <tplaner_> oal: you might be able to do that with http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ -- its my favorite select replacement currently
[06:32:17] <cusco> to get the <li>  elemennts inside a <ul> into a array... how do I do it?
[06:32:28] <conlinism> Ok awesome. I am looking for some help on XMl parsing. I have what I thinkis the correct code, but i could be very wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/NSfcA/ Code there
[06:32:38] <cusco> im trying: $("#insideList").children().each(function() { addrList.push(this.text()) });
[06:32:39] <oal> tplaner_: thanks!
[06:32:44] <cusco> but doesn't seem to be working
[06:32:46] <Cork> macro22: ah, sorry forgot
[06:32:54] <macro22> lol no worries
[06:33:01] <Zogot> oal: http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[06:33:06] <Whirl3d_> cusco, lookup .map
[06:33:10] <bot-t> cusco, http://ajpiano.com/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
[06:33:17] <cusco> ok
[06:33:37] <oal> Zogot: thanks. :)
[06:33:47] <Cork> macro22: a side note, your doctype is invalid
[06:34:08] <macro22> hmm thought I had changed them all to the HTML5 one
[06:34:27] <macro22> will go check, the live version isnt in sync with my local version
[06:35:40] <conlinism> An ideas?
[06:35:41] <macro22> Yeah your right, cheers will make sure they are all upgraded, as only 1 plugin is active on the live site, 2 other ones locally will need updating too
[06:36:16] <Cork> macro22: your running the .tabs on the ul element?
[06:36:42] <Cork> it doesen't look like its a jquery ui tabs widget, just a plain html lits
[06:36:45] <Cork> *list
[06:36:57] <macro22> should be the div
[06:37:06] <macro22> let me load up the source for it
[06:37:19] <Cork> none of the li's in it has the expected classes
[06:37:32] <macro22> there should be a div with the id "notes-container"
[06:37:50] <macro22> that is the one which will have the $(element).tabs(); applied to it
[06:37:56] <macro22> that contains the ul, and the other tab pages
[06:38:16] <Cork> well it does, but it hasn't worked on the ul > li's
[06:38:19] <macro22> the notes-container div has the ui-tabs applied
[06:38:43] <Cork> the ui-state-default is missing and ui-tab-nav and so on
[06:38:50] <macro22> I am sure im doing something stupid, as ive used tabs before on other apps fine
[06:39:18] <macro22> oh right, I wouldnt know what classes I was looking for, I just noticed one or two which looked sensible
[06:39:19] <Cork> macro22: make sure that the html your generating is actually used as dom objects
[06:39:42] <macro22> what do you mean? (Sorry if thats a stupid question)
[06:39:56] <Cork> it might actually serialize it to html and then rerender it in the dialog, and if so, you need to run tabs after its rendred
[06:39:56] <macro22> knockoutJS handles the DOM insertion mechanism
[06:40:15] <macro22> I *believe* that is what is happening
[06:40:22] <Cork> ya, but it might be its not inserting it in a way where the dom events jquery-ui adds is kept
[06:40:31] <macro22> as its loaded as a template much like everything else (Which is why the page rejiggles as it loads)
[06:40:36] <Cork> *adds isn't kept
[06:40:50] <macro22> ok I will go look into how its loaded
[06:41:07] <Cork> anyway what you have there looks like dead html
[06:41:15] <Cork> so css won't fix it
[06:41:19] <macro22> but it *should* be like: template-load-requested -> template-loaded -> template-inserted -> tabs-invoked
[06:41:35] <conlinism> Anyone have an idea on how to make this work: http://jsfiddle.net/NSfcA/1/
[06:42:08] <Cork> conlinism: you would have to proxy it over your own server
[06:42:23] <Cork> conlinism: you can't do ajax calls cross domains
[06:42:29] <ajpiano> macro22: my guess also that it's a timing issue
[06:42:33] <macro22> the other quirk is that I think colorbox kinda moves the elements when it appears, so it may be that which is breaking things
[06:42:33] <conlinism> Ahh. Thanks why
[06:42:34] <conlinism> thanks
[06:42:39] <ajpiano> that the template is being loaded after tabs is invoked
[06:43:07] <macro22> but the knockout part works, if I enter some data into the notes, save it and then reload it, its still there
[06:43:15] <macro22> which is why im baffled
[06:43:32] <ajpiano> well, why wouldn't it. knockout isn't bound to tabs being properly setup
[06:43:46] <ajpiano> it's just bound to the html existing
[06:44:05] <ajpiano> it's hard for anyone else to check considering all you've got in here is minified code ;)
[06:44:08] <macro22> I dont use IRC much so not sure how to target people like you are doing, but as I have a custom knockout binding to invoke the relevant jquery ui functions, it can *only* be triggered once the template has been loaded (as the call comes from the template)
[06:44:15] <macro22> yeah I know
[06:44:25] <ajpiano> macro22, are you familiar with the "typing" function of your keyboard ?
[06:44:30] <ajpiano> that's how you target someone else :p
[06:44:35] <macro22> I was just wondering if anyone off top of their head went "oh yeah its because of X with colorbox modals"
[06:44:50] <cusco> hi
[06:45:09] <cusco> so using .map works, Whirl3d_ but only with return this.id
[06:45:14] <squeakita> can someone help? http://test.review-mysite.com/form2/index2.php i have 2 submits, one in the middle and one at the end, everything works as expected with one glitch. if the user clicks the 2nd button first, then decided to click the disqualify , disqualify wont submit. is there a way to make this work?
[06:45:17] <cusco> I would like to return this.text instead
[06:45:20] <cusco> and isn't working
[06:45:23] <ajpiano> cusco: return $(this).text();
[06:45:27] <cusco> ahh
[06:45:28] <ajpiano> text isn't a property of a native dom element
[06:45:29] <cusco> right
[06:45:32] <cusco> ofcourse
[06:46:22] <NodeX> natvive dom is InnerText iirc
[06:46:27] <ajpiano> macro22: it's very strongly likely not some generally known issue and much more likely to be a specific timing issue in your app
[06:46:50] <macro22> its strange though, as all other jquery ui elements work fine using same mechanism
[06:46:55] <NodeX> innerText *
[06:47:02] <ajpiano> ?cik @ macro22
[06:47:02] <bot-t> macro22, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[06:47:12] <ajpiano> you don't need a live demo on jsfiddle
[06:47:25] <macro22> and as the trigger to start *tabifying* is triggered from inside the loaded template, it cannot possibly happen before the template is loaded
[06:47:25] <ajpiano> but unminified code in your live site would help a lot if you want someone to figure out what's going on
[06:47:29] <ajpiano> otherwise it's just storytime
[06:47:38] <macro22> yeah again, I wasnt planning to go into too much depth
[06:47:41] <cusco> NodeX: it is, innerText indeed
[06:47:45] <macro22> its live so uses minified builds
[06:47:58] <ajpiano> macro22: have you paused a debugger there, and checked that indeed, the entire template is loaded before tabs is invoked?
[06:47:59] <cusco> is it faster, using innerText native than $(this).ltext() right=
[06:48:02] <macro22> I was just wondering if there wasa  known thing, as its plausable that the modal rejigging dom elements under the hood could be to blame
[06:48:32] <macro22> I am sure I have but not today
[06:48:40] <macro22> as I can debug into the triggered binding
[06:49:01] <macro22> anyway you guys have shown its not some noddy thing it must be a timing issue of some sort
[06:49:08] <ajpiano> macro22: step debugging your app always works a lot better than hoping someone else knows about the interaction between the prescription drugs you're taking :p
[06:49:09] <macro22> so I will go and test some more around that area
[06:49:13] <ajpiano> good luck :)
[06:49:24] <macro22> lol you make it sound like I have not *Tried* to fix this myself
[06:49:36] <ajpiano> i don't doubt you have!
[06:49:37] <cusco> and the objective is really to POST this array to a php file using .ajax()
[06:49:46] <macro22> I have been banging my head for a couple of weeks but put it on the backburner for jqm issues, but now found some time for it
[06:49:50] <macro22> anyway thanks for your help guys!
[06:49:50] <cusco> can't data be a normal array?
[06:50:18] <Cork> cusco: no, it always has to have an object wrapping it
[06:50:27] <Cork> { my_array: [] }
[06:50:54] <Cork> cusco: else the data doens't have a key to hold the array server side
[06:51:40] <cusco> right, that is why I was seeing 'undefined' => 'undefined'
[06:51:42] <cusco> oki
[06:52:01] <johnathanb> I'm using jQuery tabs with Backbone in a modal window. The tabs work fine in the modal window if it's not the backbone version of the app calling them but not with Backbone.
[06:52:13] <ajpiano> macro22: you might want to also make sure you're using the most current jquery and jquery ui
[06:52:32] <johnathanb> When I do $("ul.tabs").tabs("div.panes > div"); in the console I get back the ul.tabs, not getting an error so $.tabs is definitely a thing.
[06:52:53] <johnathanb> Anyone have any idea why that wouldn't work or can give me any pointers at all into debugging the problem?
[06:53:42] <ajpiano> johnathanb: where in the docs does it say anything about tabs accepting a string argument with another selector in it?
[06:54:21] <johnathanb> To be honest I don't know. It's old code someone else wrote and I'm trying to port it over to Backbone.
[06:54:33] <ajpiano> well, it's a completley invalid usage
[06:54:41] <ajpiano> i'm not even sure what the expectation would be
[06:54:45] <johnathanb> I Just found it strange that the exact same code that doesn't work in Backbone works fine everywhere else.
[06:55:17] <ajpiano> one typically does not write code like that in backbone anyway
[06:55:22] <johnathanb> Ah sorry, it's actually using http://jquerytools.org/demos/tabs/index.html
[06:55:28] <ajpiano> oh awesome jquery tools
[06:55:35] <johnathanb> ajpiano: Well what would you suggest as the alternative?
[06:55:41] <johnathanb> We need tabs in a modal window..
[06:55:41] <ajpiano> jquery ui tabs :p
[06:56:05] <ajpiano> in any case, in a backbone view you're not gonna want global selections like the one you've shown
[06:56:26] <asher^> hi guys, im using a jqueryui sortable on rows of my table (using a handle), and its screwing up my ability to edit one of my contenteditable items in that row
[06:56:28] <ajpiano> you're much more likely to want something in a view's render or init function that does like, this.$el.find(".tabs").tabs()
[06:56:31] <asher^> any ideas how i can fix that?
[06:56:35] <johnathanb> How about pointers into how to debug my current problem? I can't be changing the way tabs work across the whole site. Time does not allow.
[06:57:08] <ajpiano> johnathanb: you're porting the entire site over to backbone, but there somehow isn't time to also port this piece of logic over to backbone conventions as well?
[06:57:22] <johnathanb> ajpiano: But the tabs won't be on the page at that stage. When the user clicks a button a modal window opens and loads a page in from a remote source
[06:57:34] <ajpiano> johnathanb: is the modal represented by a backbone View?
[06:57:52] <johnathanb> ajpiano: Porting one section of the site over at the minute. These modal windows are used in a lot of different places.
[06:57:56] <johnathanb> No it's not.
[06:58:53] <ajpiano> johnathanb: debug it by pausing your debugger after the modal content is loaded but before the tabs is invoked
[06:59:30] <ajpiano> and then see if the selection is selecting what you expect, etc
[07:01:56] <johnathanb> It's definitely selecting the correct thing
[07:02:04] <jeffsmykil> could someone tell me why I am getting this error: TypeError: '1280' is not a function (evaluating 'mapImageObject.width()')
[07:02:15] <jeffsmykil> when running this code: http://pastebin.com/BS61aGCW
[07:02:46] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: sounds like mapImageObject is getting reassigned to a number
[07:03:13] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: new Image doesn't return a jQuery object
[07:03:25] <ajpiano> thus it doesn't have a width() method
[07:03:37] <hooloovoo> it does have a .width tho
[07:03:44] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you have to set mapImageObject.src = "foo"
[07:03:55] <jeffsmykil> but the error is returning the correct value
[07:03:57] <ajpiano> not overwrite the actual reference to the image element with a simple string, which is what you're doing now
[07:04:25] <jeffsmykil> using width; worked
[07:05:14] <jeffsmykil> but this is the wrong way of doing this?
[07:05:25] <rethus> how can i fire a js-function, if any of the select-fields inside of <fieldset id="product-options-wrapper"> is changed ?
[07:05:41] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: not setting .src is definitely the wrong way
[07:05:57] <jeffsmykil> oh
[07:06:00] <jeffsmykil> thats a typo
[07:06:05] <jeffsmykil> mapImageObject.src
[07:06:19] <jeffsmykil> I have .src in my code
[07:06:47] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: it's the same as anything else, you can use a jquery method or you can access the native dom property/method
[07:08:13] <jeffsmykil> how was the conference ajpiano?
[07:08:22] <ajpiano> awesome
[07:08:49] <jeffsmykil> do you still learn things at those
[07:08:57] <ajpiano> a bit here and there
[07:09:00] <ajpiano> i also was hosting the conf so
[07:09:06] <ajpiano> had my hands kinda full with that
[07:09:27] <ajpiano> more focused on making sure other people still learn things at those :)
[07:09:45] <jeffsmykil> im thinking about going to a beaucoup one at the end of the month
[07:09:47] <jeffsmykil> cant decide
[07:10:30] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: which one ?
[07:10:43] <jeffsmykil> the begining game dev one sounds fun
[07:10:49] <jeffsmykil> ive just started playing with canvas
[07:10:54] <jeffsmykil> dont have the money for the others
[07:10:56] <ajpiano> oh i actually went to that one myself
[07:11:05] <rethus> would something like this work:
[07:11:10] <ajpiano> it's pretty solid
[07:11:20] <rethus> $j("#product-options-wrapper select").click(function(){
[07:11:20] <rethus> });
[07:11:33] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: will it be over my head?
[07:11:45] <ajpiano> it shouldn't be, i never really even touched canvas before i went to it
[07:14:34] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/5XSYn/
[07:14:39] <rethus> didn't work... why
[07:15:16] <asher^> you need a . before html for a start
[07:16:20] <rethus> yes, thanks. was a little mistake... but after i fix it, i found out, i have not only to click on the select to open it, but on an entry of the select, to fire "click" http://jsfiddle.net/5XSYn/2/
[07:17:05] <asher^> why do you want to fire on click btw?
[07:18:49] <Test> hi
[07:19:16] <Test> I need technical help
[07:19:20] <Test> anyone please
[07:19:46] <Test> I need technical help in JQuery
[07:19:50] <Test> anyone please
[07:19:50] <asher^> rethus it works fine, you just need to select jquert as the framework
[07:20:01] <shoky> test, ask
[07:20:20] <Test> How can I retain the viewstate of the treeview
[07:20:36] <Test> built of dTree.js
[07:20:47] <shoky> :\
[07:21:43] <jb_gfx> lol
[07:21:54] <jb_gfx> dTree is not even written with jquery...
[07:22:21] <Test> so
[07:22:36] <jb_gfx> so you are in the jquery channel...
[07:22:51] <shoky> asking for jquery help
[07:22:56] <jb_gfx> :)
[07:22:59] <jb_gfx> funny
[07:23:05] <Test> Could you please guide me which channel should I join
[07:23:11] <asher^> anyone know a jquery plugin that does the same thing that 'contenteditable' does?
[07:23:48] <Test> anyone ?
[07:24:19] <Test> the JS file we are using in our project is
[07:24:23] <Test> dTree.js
[07:24:40] <jb_gfx> yeah we got that
[07:25:11] <Test> Could u please guide
[07:25:13] <Test> ?
[07:25:37] <jiu> hi everyone
[07:26:07] <jb_gfx> you could read the doc of that script or even contact the author. but since the last update was made in 2003, i doubt it's still supported
[07:37:46] <johnathanb> Any way to check for an element being created on the pagE?
[07:40:58] <MarkHUK> hi all.
[07:41:08] <MarkHUK> anyone familiar with a plugin called Chosen?
[07:44:13] <warrenparsons> MarkHUK: I've used it.
[07:44:38] <Pilate> same
[07:46:47] <jeffsmykil> i have used it too
[07:46:51] <jeffsmykil> chosen that is
[07:51:27] <MarkHUK> warrenparsons: having some issues with it....
[07:51:46] <MarkHUK> i am using the Ajax plugin option someone made, i've got users in a user table in my database...
[07:52:08] <warrenparsons> MarkHUK: I haven't used that plugin.
[07:52:09] <MarkHUK> basically its making a list like: ["name 1", "name 2", "name 3"]
[07:52:18] <MarkHUK> but the value="" id's
[07:52:23] <MarkHUK> are not that of my users so it makes it useless
[07:52:33] <MarkHUK> i need to get the users id's as the values for each <option...>
[07:54:06] <jeffsmykil> markHUK what does the json look like?
[07:54:12] <jeffsmykil> that the service is returning
[07:54:26] <MarkHUK> jeffsmykil: as above.
[07:54:32] <MarkHUK> ["name 1", "name 2", "name 3"]
[07:54:44] <jeffsmykil> why is that a problem with chosen then?
[07:54:51] <jeffsmykil> thats a problem with your data structure
[07:55:37] <MarkHUK> jeffsmykil: chosen is making its own value id's
[07:55:37] <LukeNukem> yao dawgz
[07:55:50] <MarkHUK> i want to change it (obviously)
[07:55:56] <MarkHUK> to send my users id's as well
[07:56:02] <MarkHUK> just not sure where to start with it
[07:56:03] <jeffsmykil> well I guess im just dumb and it wasnt that obvious to me
[07:56:13] <jeffsmykil> then opopulate the chosen manually
[07:56:26] <MarkHUK> with 1000's of records?
[07:56:27] <jeffsmykil> thre is a trigger chosen update
[07:56:39] <jeffsmykil> if you have thousands of records you shouldnt be using a dropdown
[07:56:48] <jeffsmykil> but yeah you could loop through 1000s of records
[07:56:51] <MarkHUK> i need something like chosen
[07:57:02] <MarkHUK> for the way it contains each selected item
[07:57:05] <jeffsmykil> the problem is if you are doing it that way
[07:57:09] <jeffsmykil> you are running two for loops
[07:57:15] <jeffsmykil> one for the normal select and one for the chosen
[07:57:21] <jeffsmykil> we have run into this problem where I work
[07:57:29] <jeffsmykil> the solution was autocomplete
[07:57:38] <MarkHUK> ok
[07:57:39] <MarkHUK> but
[07:57:47] <MarkHUK> i need to have multiple recipients
[07:57:58] <MarkHUK> like how chosen puts the box round each recipient
[07:58:09] <MarkHUK> its for a messaging function
[07:58:36] <jeffsmykil> ok so you can code that one yourself pretty easilly
[07:58:50] <jeffsmykil> just add each autocomplete selection to a field or something
[07:59:01] <jeffsmykil> and clear the autcomplete field on return or something
[07:59:13] <jeffsmykil> doesnt jquery uii have multiple autocomplete in it?
[07:59:43] <jeffsmykil> MarkHUK: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[08:00:19] <MarkHUK> jeffsmykil: will check it out now
[08:00:51] <jeffsmykil> ive come to the conclusion that a dropdown with more than 50 entries isn't very user friendly
[08:01:09] <loke> I have created a style sheep element that contains a :before and a :after element that adds some extra, stuff... Now, if the main element has a "background-color" set in the CSS file, the background colour of the :before and :after content take the same colour. However, if I create an instance of this element using $("<span class='...', and then apply a background colour using .css({"background-color":...}), then only the main element gets the
[08:01:09] <loke>  background colour. The :before and :after content gets the colour from the CSS file.
[08:01:11] <jeffsmykil> but thats me you might decide otherwise
[08:01:19] <loke> Is there a way around this?
[08:02:12] <loke> I guess a different way to phrase my question would be: "How can I manipulate the CSS properties of :before and :after elements from Jquery?"
[08:02:40] <jeffsmykil> with before and after?
[08:02:56] <jeffsmykil> http://api.jquery.com/before/
[08:03:15] <ajpiano> loke: you can't really
[08:03:17] <loke> oh dear. Is it really that easy? Checking...
[08:03:33] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: that's not for manipulating the :before and :after pseudo elements
[08:03:39] <loke> yeah
[08:03:47] <loke> ajpiano: seems to be right
[08:03:53] <ajpiano> loke: the best you can hope for is to just keep on manipulating style rules in the stylesheet
[08:04:01] <jeffsmykil> yeah im looking how I do it in my code
[08:04:02] <jeffsmykil> sorry
[08:04:06] <loke> So I need to break out the :before and :after into elements in their own right?
[08:04:26] <jeffsmykil> could he use next?
[08:04:27] <MarkHUK> jeffsmykil: that doesn't have a box round the selected one tho
[08:04:37] <MarkHUK> it just selects one
[08:04:41] <MarkHUK> in the input field
[08:05:02] <jeffsmykil> you will need some custom code MarkHUK
[08:05:07] <MarkHUK> erugh
[08:05:52] <jeffsmykil> sorry for the bad advice loke
[08:05:56] <dobalina> should jquery ui questions be asked here too? :)
[08:07:25] <asher^> dobalina, go for it
[08:08:44] <dobalina> I'm trying to get a slider working on a site http://6precision.com/41-batterie-nimh on the left side in div <div class="PM_ASCriterionStepEnable">.  But the slider just won't seem to show up.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Someone else originally implemented it but i'm starting to think it never acrtually worked
[08:09:01] <dobalina> or maybe i need to update jquery ui or something
[08:09:23] <dobalina> it's supposed to be a slider between price limits
[08:12:31] <loke> I worked around the problem in a (probably) ugly way... I created an extra style for each background colour I want to support (it was easy, as there is only 3). Then I created CSS entries for those .special:before { color: xxx} , etc...
[08:12:46] <loke> Then I can simply add a style class for the colour I want.
[08:15:10] <jasabella> is there a channel for bootstrap?
[08:15:24] <freazy> hi, have an inputfield where i fill the possible entrys with autocomplete, if i type in something i can choose an entry..if i do it with my keyboard it works, i do a mouseclick it dont work. Do anyone know this problem?
[08:15:49] <dobalina> asher^:  any idea why the slider isn't showing up?  anything stand out ? :/
[08:18:47] <johnline> i have created a function but am unsure of the syntax on how to call it
[08:18:49] <teewuane> freazy: is it not actually setting the value of the input?
[08:19:12] <johnline> $('#header').hover(function() {functionName?});
[08:19:16] <teewuane> freazy: or is it just leaving the value as what you had type in so far...
[08:20:18] <freazy> its setting the value but the action dont fire
[08:25:01] <freazy> actually i need an event to fire the method
[08:25:17] <freazy> $(document).on('keyup', '#search', function(e) { //do something }  works
[08:25:26] <freazy> but no mouseevents
[08:25:50] <asher^> maybe you want to add 'paste' too?
[08:27:04] <freazy> its not so easy i work with zend framework and the lib jquery_x
[08:27:46] <freazy> i write it new
[08:29:15] <MINTTU[MB]> how can i set my mouseover (specific rolldown-menu) to react after 2 seconds of hovering of the button ?:P
[08:32:23] <MINTTU[MB]> is hoverIntent the best choice ?
[08:32:47] <nFFFF> MINTTU[MB], yes or write your own but its hardly a large plugin
[08:33:23] <MINTTU[MB]> I haven't coded jQuery in 3 years so i've forgot the most of the syntax and functions :/
[08:33:46] <MINTTU[MB]> so to write my own would take to long
[08:38:53] <gabejacobs> Why is it that when I use the setInterval function to delay an action, each time it run the amount of milliseconds it waits is cut in half
[08:39:58] <timing> gabejacobs: maybe hit the turbo button to go from 66mhz to 33mhz?
[08:40:04] <asher^> lol
[08:40:06] <johnline> setTimeout(headerover(), 4000); <will this snippet of code call the 'headerover' function in 4 seconds?
[08:40:26] <timing> johnline: that will run headerover() instantly
[08:40:32] <timing> remove the ()
[08:40:37] <johnline> ah yeah, thats what i am seeing atm
[08:40:42] <johnline> thanks
[08:41:15] <johnline> its all about timing
[08:41:19] <timing> it sure is :-)
[08:42:55] <tash> On this page, how does the calculation know to sum the correct column? http://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/footer_callback.html
[08:43:12] <tash> as opposed to say, the Engine version, column.
[08:43:34] <kelye> hello ... the  'on' method should work on dynamically added  elements, no ?
[08:45:05] <kelye> if i have something like $('.class a').on('click', function(ev) {alert('a')}) and i add with a new link with js .. the .on should cover the new element also
[08:45:16] <ajpiano> kelye: no
[08:45:23] <ajpiano> kelye: in principle, yes, .on works for that
[08:45:31] <ajpiano> but the "future" elements need to be included in the method call
[08:45:49] <ajpiano> and the element you select with jQuery $(".foo") have to be in the DOM at the time you make the selection
[08:46:14] <kelye> .on is a replacement for .live and .live was doing that
[08:46:21] <ajpiano> right but it works differently
[08:46:23] <kelye> at each dom change
[08:46:35] <ajpiano> kelye: if you want to emulate live you have to do $(document).on("click", ".foo", bar)
[08:47:01] <kelye> and the other solution is ?
[08:47:16] <kelye> keeping my $('.class a') method
[08:47:41] <k1ng> i need help with progress bar. i made my php script echo progress

[09:23:38] <jedimind> good luck ?
[09:23:44] <asher^> :)
[09:23:49] <freazy> lol
[09:23:56] <rahul> wht good luck...so wht should i have tpo do
[09:24:04] <jedimind> well first you write some html
[09:24:06] <jedimind> then you write some css
[09:24:08] <jedimind> then some javascript
[09:24:11] <jedimind> and then you're done
[09:24:12] <rahul> ]lol
[09:24:18] <rahul> how easy
[09:24:25] <jedimind> yup, simple
[09:24:30] <rahul> then you do
[09:24:34] <jedimind> gladly
[09:24:35] <jedimind> pay me
[09:24:54] <rahul> how much you want
[09:25:10] <jammsen> is it possible to have multiple change submit events on the same named selects?
[09:25:14] <asher^> $20k
[09:25:19] <jammsen> each select has its own form
[09:25:21] <Falcon`> rahul: google?
[09:25:22] <Falcon`> http://www.flash-to-html5.net/
[09:25:29] <jammsen> but only first select triggers an event
[09:25:35] <Falcon`> there're plenty of libs on the net to do what you need
[09:25:40] <jedimind> realistically? for somethign like this? probably in the $5-7.5k range, with no design adjustments or anything just straight over port
[09:25:43] <rahul> only falcon thankz
[09:25:45] <jedimind> Falcon`, they hardly yield good results
[09:26:02] <Falcon`> well yes, they might not handle so complex flash animation
[09:26:06] <Falcon`> but still, some point to start from
[09:26:17] <jedimind> no, they'll handle most ANIMATIONS just fine, its the rest of the site and interactions and whatnot that are the problem
[09:26:20] <jedimind> but i digress
[09:27:24] <rahul> using jqury it is possible?
[09:27:38] <Falcon`> no, jquery has a lot different purpose
[09:27:38] <jammsen> Problem - Is it possible to have multiple change submit events on the same named selects? Each select has its own form but only first select triggers an event :(
[09:28:06] <jedimind> rahul, it would be possible, but you dont _need_ jquery to replicate that site
[09:28:13] <jedimind> you'd be better of fwith a library that has a greater focus on animation
[09:28:21] <jedimind> without all the other stuff that jquery offers
[09:28:29] <nFFFF> You could quite easily rebuild that site
[09:28:34] <nFFFF> using jQuery yea
[09:28:41] <nFFFF> if you had the images itd take a few dyas to do
[09:28:59] <jedimind> nFFFF, click around, there are some tricky animations throughout, it wouldnt be hard but it'd be time consuming
[09:28:59] <freazy> how can i show the selected entry of my autocomplete-input ? http://jsfiddle.net/3u9Gu/1/
[09:29:01] <jedimind> to do them all nicely
[09:29:12] <jedimind> it'd be a tedious effort more than a skilled one
[09:32:24] <freazy> whcih lib has a greater focus on animations?
[09:35:21] <bogardi> can anyone help me generate a div in a random x position and then animate it to the bottom of the page
[09:35:46] <eternalsword> is jsperf offline or is it just me?
[09:36:56] <bogardi>  function animate() {
[09:36:56] <bogardi>    	var posx = (Math.random() * ($(document).width())).toFixed();
[09:36:56] <bogardi>                   $('.raindrop').stop().animate({
[09:36:56] <bogardi>                     top: $(window).height()
[09:36:56] <bogardi>                     opacity: 0
[09:36:57] <bogardi>                     left: posx+'px'
[09:36:57] <bogardi>                   }, 2050, 'linear', function() {
[09:36:58] <bogardi>                   	$('.raindrop').css('opacity', '1');
[09:36:58] <bogardi>                   	$('.raindrop').css('top', '50px');
[09:36:59] <bogardi>                   	animate(); });
[09:36:59] <bogardi>              }
[09:37:00] <bogardi>            animate();
[09:37:01] <bogardi>            });
[09:37:04] <eternalsword> bogardi, shouldn't be too hard
[09:37:04] <bogardi> that works except for generating it in a random X position

[09:50:36] <mdunham918_> hey guys I'm building a photo gallery manager and I have this idea of how I'd ilke to transition into a folder or group of images. Right now I have this icon grid you can see here: http://local.matthewdunham.com:1337/prognosis/filemanager/?user_id=1337&patient_id=1 I want so that when you click on a smart folder for example that the images or icons that are with-in the folder explode from the center of the folder outward. I'm thinking
[09:50:37] <mdunham918_> would be something like a transfer effect but I'm unsure Has anyone seen an effect like this?
[09:50:45] <LuisLeite> <- kinda n00b with jsfiddle lol
[09:52:20] <bogardi> hey thanks LuisLeite, it works in jsfiddle but not on my site
[09:52:24] <freazy> how can i show the selected entry of my autocomplete-input ? http://jsfiddle.net/3u9Gu/1/
[09:52:40] <LuisLeite> bogardi, what browser are u using?
[09:53:01] <bogardi> chrome
[09:53:19] <LuisLeite> go to dev tools, and check if gives any error on script
[09:53:48] <mdunham918_> pretty cool raindrop

[09:54:06] <bogardi> thank you
[09:54:12] <LuisLeite> you welcome :)
[09:55:20] <bogardi> what about changing the start position before the raindrop animates to the bottom
[09:55:37] <eternalsword> bogardi, http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/
[09:56:57] <bogardi> cool now how do i make it vary if i have multiple raindrops?
[09:58:12] <k1ng> LuisLeite; overflow:hidden
[09:59:07] <LuisLeite> k1ng, uh?
[09:59:25] <k1ng> hide the scroll bar
[09:59:29] <k1ng> with css
[10:00:01] <LuisLeite> that work its from bogardi not mine
[10:00:23] <tash> has anyone in here used DataTables? And, if so, the footer callback feature?
[10:00:33] <bogardi> anyway to make multiple raindrops appear at different x positions without multiple functions? http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/
[10:00:57] <cannjeff> bogardi I'm working on something for ya
[10:01:29] <bogardi> okay cool tahnk you
[10:06:34] <MINTTU[MB]> My 'rolldown' menu is failing to roll down :'( can someone take alook: http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/ (Rolldown over Services)
[10:09:09] <fitorec> H1!
[10:11:24] <fitorec> Hello!, I writing a tutorial of jQuery basic in spanish, someone speaking Spanish in this channel?
[10:11:58] <MINTTU[MB]> hola? no habla espanl
[10:12:28] <fitorec> Is very basic,the repository is hosted on github:  http://mundosica.github.com/tutorial_hispano_jQuery/
[10:12:55] <fitorec> Hola me gustaria que alguien me diera una opinin al respecto
[10:13:16] <simon> when I do $("<div></div>"), I get [obj] rather than obj. if I'm making a function that returns a UI component that I'm designing, would it be idiomatic to return foo[0] rather than foo when it's only got one DOM element?
[10:13:28] <fitorec> I would like someone to give me a feedback about
[10:14:02] <simon> or should I stick to returning foo, because jQuery will be able to map over it (in the functional sense)?
[10:14:21] <eternalsword> bogardi, see http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/3/
[10:15:20] <jSlack> hard to say simin...
[10:15:23] <jSlack> but i try to never piss of jquery
[10:15:45] <simon> wouldn't want that... :)
[10:15:58] <Whirl3d> Could someone explain what I am doing wrong that I would end up with nothing in my browser window and nothing under the <html> element in Chrome Dev Tools, yet just seconds earlier, I logged several pages of content and their respective divs with no problems.
[10:16:55] <eternalsword> Whirl3d: server error?
[10:17:51] <Whirl3d> Maybe I'll restart Chrome. If I log  $(".page").length)  I get 9 so something's up. Thanks for the reply, Imma restart
[10:24:20] <Whirl3d> Okay, that solved the stange dom inspector issue. Now when I get the html data back in the success handler from an ajax call, the content is supposed to replace a div in my markup of class "page"....if ( simple apply the data directly using existingPage.html(data); I end up with an embedded "page" element and a meta tag and title tag.
[10:25:09] <Whirl3d> so logically, I want to grab just the html from the page element of the newly loaded data...page.html($(data).find(".page").html()); doesn't work.
[10:25:34] <xboi209> $("#foo").load("/foo.html .rawr");     <---How can I use something like .eq(0) to specify which .rawr I want?
[10:27:01] <Whirl3d> is it because $(data) is not actually creating the newly loaded elements, but rather just wrapping the string in a jquery object? How else (besides an ugly regex or the alt syntax for .load) can i grab select content from a document loaded as html via AJAX?
[10:27:32] <Whirl3d> what do you mean "like ..eq(0)"
[10:28:18] <Whirl3d> if you mean in the content you are planning to load, you want to grab a specific piece seperate out the selector the subcontent with a space and add it to your url for load
[10:28:55] <xboi209> well i have multiple .rawr classes and I need something like .eq(0) to choose which one i want
[10:29:41] <eternalsword> xboi209, how about :first
[10:29:58] <dabear_> xboi209: did you try :eq(0) ? :p
[10:30:04] <xboi209> o.O
[10:30:05] <andrewhl> I'm trying to do an ajax request on a Facebook callback (for a like button). The callback works (it alerts on success), but my ajax script isn't doing anything. http://pastie.org/4226818
[10:30:08] <xboi209> never thought of that
[10:30:12] <andrewhl> Am I not binding the ajax event properly?
[10:30:14] <Whirl3d> interesting question...i wonder how the selector works for that
[10:31:47] <Whirl3d> andrewhl, I gave up on pastie, pastebin, etc. I've gone fiddle-or-nothing here.
[10:32:28] <andrewhl> Whirl3d, ok I'll try that
[10:32:44] <Whirl3d> right on, thanks.
[10:41:05] <eternalsword> andrewhl: does the alert say that status is success, or is it notmodified?
[10:41:28] <andrewhl> eternalsword: The alerts inside the ajax function don't trigger. Only the first alert does.
[10:42:29] <Whirl3d> andrewhl, /like is not a valid url
[10:43:07] <Whirl3d> and I usually use the notation $.ajax(url, {options});   but I think both work
[10:43:35] <andrewhl> Whirl3d like's an action in the controller I'm using. I have another ajax call that sends to '/tweet' (after a tweet callback), and that works fine. It's a tweet url defined in the controller.
[10:43:38] <andrewhl> It's a rails application
[10:43:54] <eternalsword> andrewhl: and you should add an error handler, so you can get the error codes
[10:44:52] <Whirl3d> ko, now I'm realy no help cause I don't do rails applications...
[10:44:54] <andrewhl> something like this, eternalsword? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/377644/jquery-ajax-error-handling-show-custom-exception-messages
[10:45:37] <andrewhl> Whirl3d: the fact that it's a rails application shouldn't affect the ajax alert, which is all I'm testing for right now
[10:46:25] <eternalsword> andrewhl: yes, that would do, just copy the error: block.  don't forget the comma after the success: block
[10:49:57] <EyePulp> totally inappropriate channel question, but does anyone recall one of the stripped down youtube video playback sites?
[10:50:41] <Whirl3d> I just meant that I don't have any idea what you mean by a "url defined in the controller" ... I'd double check the facebook api and make sure it's the same as the previously successfull tweet you mentioned...
[10:51:11] <Whirl3d> Stripped Down Youtube playback sites? whaddya mean?
[10:52:30] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: it's a 3rd party site that can playback (mostly) any youtube video, but it just de-clutters it - no comments or other junky chrome
[10:53:06] <EyePulp> but I can't remember the url, and searching for it is sort of a mess.  the word "youtube" kind of obliterates useful results
[10:53:43] <Whirl3d> hold on, lemme look. I think I used one called replay converter to grab youtube videos...lemme check
[10:54:03] <Whirl3d> maybe replay catcher or something...brb
[10:54:50] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: not looking to grab the videos - just show them on a less noisy page
[10:54:57] <neumino> Any idea how I can retrieve the property selectionStart on focus on a textarea ?
[10:55:02] <neumino> It always returns 0
[10:55:17] <neumino> I don't want to use a setTImeout with a 1ms delay
[10:55:55] <Whirl3d> sure, I thought it had an option to do that, but it's something else...
[10:56:56] <eternalsword> neumino, are you using a webkit-based browser?
[10:57:23] <neumino> eternalsword, yes
[10:57:26] <neumino> I'm using chromium
[10:58:01] <neumino> On firefox it works but not on chromium
[10:58:24] <Whirl3d> EyePulp, http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta   not eactly what you are looking for but interesting
[10:58:37] <andrewhl> eternalsword: thanks for your help! It was a 404 error. I needed to set up a route in my application to the specified url. Works perfectly now. I'll definitely remember in the future to add error handlers.
[10:58:43] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: yeah I saw that one - thanks for looking
[10:59:40] <eternalsword> there's an issue in webkit where you need a delay after focus to have access to the properties.  you might try doing something on click instead of on focus.  keyboard nav should always select the entire thing anyways if I recall correctly.
[11:01:34] <eternalsword> the reason on click might work is I believe focus changes on mousedown, but click won't fire until mouseup, so that delay may be enough.
[11:01:51] <neumino> Oh nice trick
[11:02:05] <neumino> Looks like it's working eternalsword
[11:02:06] <neumino> Thanks
[11:02:49] <mbroadst> hi, I'm trying to dynamically load a form and display it as a dialog using web2py, the actual "view" for the "create" method (in this case) is just a <div> with a title as well as a form. my problem is that if I use a temporary <div> on the originating page and load the view into that and try to call dialog on it, it tries to use the parent div to look for the title, is there a way I can get around this?
[11:03:26] <tash> anyone in here able to help with a DataTables issue I'm running into?
[11:04:30] <mbroadst> tash: I might be able to, but I don't have your question in my log here
[11:04:59] <jsonp> hi
[11:05:01] <tash> mbroadst: that's ok, I don't think I described anything useful yet
[11:05:04] <jsonp> im trying to use jsonp
[11:05:08] <jsonp> when i do getJSON
[11:05:15] <jsonp> i see the result in the firebug
[11:05:24] <jsonp> but when i try to use it function (response)
[11:05:27] <jsonp> it is empty
[11:05:30] <kreaper> is there a specific channel for jquery mobile?
[11:05:34] <jsonp> what can i do?
[11:05:36] <tash> mbroadst:  so, in the example here http://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/footer_callback.html I don't understand how they get the Total to actually display on the page.
[11:05:40] <eternalsword> mbroadst: dialog as in jquery ui's dialog?
[11:05:48] <mbroadst> eternalsword: yes
[11:05:55] <tash> do I need to add html? Or does the fnFooterCallback do all that for you?
[11:06:15] <jsonp> is there something like jsonp that doesnt require a server change
[11:06:21] <jsonp> i want to use rest apis
[11:06:28] <jsonp> but most sites dont support jsonp
[11:06:40] <eternalsword> mbroadst: on what jquery object are you calling .dialog?
[11:06:52] <tash> mbroadst: basically i have a table with 1 column I want to sum and place in the header something like Total Hours: <sum >
[11:07:01] <tash> footer I mean, not header
[11:07:10] <BinaryKitten> jsonp: what about a server level proxy
[11:07:18] <jsonp> i dont want to use a server
[11:07:24] <mbroadst> eternalsword: well what I had originally done was create a div on that page called "dialogContainer" and then just did a $('#dialogContainer').load(url).dialog(options)
[11:07:26] <jsonp> i want to do everything clientside
[11:07:31] <jsonp> and hook into apis
[11:07:40] <BinaryKitten> well then you're bound by the cross domain limitation
[11:07:55] <mbroadst> eternalsword: that's not going to work, because the dialog is using the outermost div for where it looks for the title
[11:07:56] <jsonp> i want to make a completely distributed app
[11:08:03] <jsonp> well i can see the return
[11:08:05] <jsonp> in firebug
[11:08:08] <jsonp> the json result
[11:08:14] <jsonp> how come i cant get to it in jquery
[11:08:21] <mbroadst> tash: ah yes, you'll have to modify the dom yourself there, like in the example
[11:08:24] <jsonp> function (response) is empty
[11:08:24] <jsonp> why
[11:08:28] <jsonp> how do i get to it
[11:08:32] <BinaryKitten> jsonp the console is not on the site
[11:08:33] <jsonp> i mean it returns it in firebug
[11:08:47] <BinaryKitten> thus it's limited in the same manner
[11:08:50] <jsonp> but it sends the correct response
[11:08:58] <jsonp> i see it in firebug
[11:09:02] <jsonp> so it returns json
[11:09:09] <jsonp> how can i get it
[11:09:15] <BinaryKitten> jsonp you can't
[11:09:21] <jsonp> why not
[11:09:31] <BinaryKitten> because of cross domain limitations
[11:09:33] <jsonp> how come when i put it in the url
[11:09:34] <Whirl3d> ? sop
[11:09:35] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[11:09:41] <jsonp> i get json back
[11:10:20] <BinaryKitten> jsonp if you are in your car, you can't access the door of another car. If you're outside the car (firebug) you can access both
[11:10:42] <jsonp> how come i can do it if i put it in the url bar
[11:10:53] <BinaryKitten> url bar is not part of the site either
[11:10:57] <BinaryKitten> it's part of the browser
[11:11:00] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: viewpure.com is along the lines of what I was talking about earlier - strips all the chrome off the youtube interface.
[11:11:14] <jsonp> well is there a way i can open up a pop up
[11:11:17] <jsonp> put in there
[11:11:19] <Whirl3d> EyePulp, thanks  looking at it now.
[11:11:28] <BinaryKitten> jsonp no
[11:11:28] <jsonp> and read it from my first tab?
[11:11:34] <jsonp> why not
[11:11:39] <BinaryKitten> same reason
[11:11:48] <jsonp> i cant read the dom in another tab?
[11:11:53] <BinaryKitten> no
[11:12:01] <jsonp> damn it >_<
[11:12:06] <tash> mbroadst: I guess I don't understand ... what are they doing in the example to get it to display?
[11:12:07] <jsonp> how is jsonp suppose to work then
[11:12:26] <BinaryKitten> jsonp is a self executing script tag
[11:12:31] <mbroadst> tash: I see where you're probably getting it wrong, they look for all elements of type "<th>" but ONLY in the <tfoot> section (hence the footer callback)
[11:12:41] <jsonp> it requires a change on the server tho?
[11:12:48] <jsonp> to support it?
[11:12:50] <mbroadst> in this case, there is only one (look at the source for that page), and its changing the innerHTML of that object
[11:12:58] <BinaryKitten> the api needs to support it jsonp
[11:13:04] <jsonp> damn it
[11:13:07] <jsonp> wth
[11:13:14] <jsonp> so rest api doesnt do it outta the box
[11:13:21] <jsonp> i mean any rest api
[11:13:21] <BinaryKitten> rest api is not the issue
[11:13:34] <BinaryKitten> the issue is the Sop
[11:13:53] <jsonp> who made up this sop bs
[11:14:01] <jsonp> how come an exe can do it
[11:14:05] <jsonp> or a server
[11:14:06] <BinaryKitten> the people who are a lot smarter than any of us
[11:14:08] <MINTTU[MB]> My 'rolldown' menu is failing to roll down :'( can someone take alook: http://gstc.eu/gstc_dev/ (Rolldown over Services) Im using hoverIntent
[11:14:09] <tash> mbroadst: so, I actually need to add a <tfoot> section to my html similar to the source?
[11:14:15] <mbroadst> tash: yes
[11:14:18] <tash> ah, ok
[11:14:23] <tash> i'll try that after lunch :)
[11:14:24] <tash> thanks
[11:14:25] <BinaryKitten> jsonp would you want my script accessing your email?
[11:14:27] <jsonp> what makes it ok for a wcf to do it
[11:14:37] <BinaryKitten> or your facebook credentials and data?
[11:14:46] <eternalsword> mbroadst: you'll want to use a callback.  you want to check for success anyways before continuing.  in the callback, call dialog on the element you need. And here's a tip, $(document.getElementById('dialogContainer')) is actually faster.
[11:14:49] <jsonp> how do people do xss then
[11:15:02] <BinaryKitten> that's a different kettle of fish
[11:15:10] <BinaryKitten> and i'm not going to go into how you do that
[11:15:21] <jsonp> can i access rest api with xss?
[11:15:26] <BinaryKitten> jsonp no
[11:15:31] <jsonp> why not
[11:15:37] <BinaryKitten> because you can't
[11:15:45] <jsonp> then whats xss good for
[11:15:55] <BinaryKitten> nothing good
[11:15:56] <MINTTU[MB]> tash, timezone ?:)
[11:16:11] <jsonp> well i want to make a full app clientside
[11:16:16] <BinaryKitten> jsonp how about you let us know what you want to achieve, the platform you are programming for etc
[11:16:18] <jsonp> is there another tech i can use
[11:16:40] <jsonp> i want to make a app that accesses my box cloud storage
[11:16:43] <Whirl3d> you could write your own browser
[11:16:44] <jsonp> gets the pix
[11:16:48] <jsonp> and make a slideshow
[11:16:52] <jsonp> but i dont want to host a server
[11:16:56] <jsonp> i just want html
[11:17:06] <jsonp> box has a rest api
[11:17:08] <eternalsword> jsonp, if the site has a rest api what you do is create your application on your domain, which queries the remote.  you then use ajax on your application
[11:17:24] <BinaryKitten> eternalsword that's what they don't want to do
[11:17:37] * BinaryKitten sees the start of the course again
[11:17:45] <jsonp> i dont want to host
[11:18:03] <eternalsword> not going to work then.
[11:18:11] <kriestof> Hi, I need to get width of my image after resizing it in css. this.css("width"), where this is some img doesn't work. How can I do it?
[11:18:23] <BinaryKitten> jsonp if you box cloud storage doesn't support cross domain access via js then you have no chance in getting it done
[11:18:51] <Whirl3d> unless you stored the shit with your cloud based storage
[11:18:56] <Whirl3d> then it's local
[11:19:15] <eternalsword> jsonp, if it's just html, you can use curl or something to get it local.
[11:19:38] <BinaryKitten> even then, most give the access to it Whirl3d
[11:19:45] <BinaryKitten> *most don't give access
[11:20:01] <BinaryKitten> they force the public viewable stuff to a different domain
[11:20:12] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I see folks do it with dropbox all the time, but that's prolly different
[11:20:31] <jsonp_> did i get kicked?
[11:20:36] <jsonp_> what were u saying?
[11:20:47] <BinaryKitten> just that you're out of luck jsonp_
[11:20:58] <jsonp_> serious?
[11:21:06] <eternalsword> jsonp_, if it's just html, you can use curl or something to get it local.
[11:21:06] <BinaryKitten> serious as a hammer to the head
[11:21:17] <jsonp_> i use curl
[11:21:18] <BinaryKitten> eternalsword you can't curl from html
[11:21:30] <jsonp_> i made a wcf app
[11:21:32] <jsonp_> already
[11:21:34] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ doesn't want server stuff
[11:21:44] <jsonp_> using curl
[11:21:52] <jsonp_> but now i want to to make it in browser
[11:22:02] <jsonp_> and i dont want to run a server like my wcf app
[11:22:07] <jsonp_> how come wcf can do it
[11:22:17] <BinaryKitten> different platform
[11:22:22] <BinaryKitten> different rules
[11:22:37] <jsonp_> can flash do it?
[11:22:40] <Whirl3d> so what's the magic number, jsonp_? how many times do we have to tell you no before you stop explaining that you want the impossible...
[11:23:03] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ flash could yes
[11:23:04] <Whirl3d> I mean I can paste as many times as you need, just let me know...
[11:23:07] <jsonp_> well come up with a soultion
[11:23:10] <kriestof> Again :), I need to get width of my image after resizing it in css. this.css("width"), where this is some img doesn't work. How can I do it?
[11:23:24] <jsonp_> wow
[11:23:24] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ it's not our job to come up with a solution
[11:23:29] <Whirl3d> did you try .width()
[11:23:30] <NoiseEee> lol
[11:23:30] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ i get paid to do that
[11:23:30] <jsonp_> mayb i will make it in flash
[11:23:42] <eternalsword> BinaryKitten: you beat me to the punch
[11:23:46] <BinaryKitten> flash is it's own boss
[11:23:47] <kriestof> Whirl3d: it gives a size of original image
[11:24:10] <BinaryKitten> it may sit in a browser, but effectively you're making a "server" application that grabs data
[11:24:16] <jsonp_> ok im gonna do flash programming then
[11:24:16] <Whirl3d> how did you resize it in css?
[11:24:24] <BinaryKitten> ok jsonp_ good luck
[11:24:35] <BinaryKitten> you're going to need it
[11:24:46] <jsonp_> why
[11:24:52] <kriestof> Whirl3d: I made some class where I have width: mywidth;
[11:24:53] <jsonp_> its just actionscript right?
[11:24:59] <BinaryKitten> lolz
[11:25:17] <jsonp_> i mean i alredy did it in csharp
[11:25:20] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ i hope you get the right license for flash
[11:25:28] <jsonp_> what do u mean
[11:25:33] <BinaryKitten> well flash is not free
[11:25:38] <Whirl3d> so maybe you could wrap your image in a div and rather than resize the image, resize the div.
[11:25:50] <Whirl3d> and set the image to 100% of it's container
[11:26:04] <jsonp_> i already got adobe
[11:26:15] <BinaryKitten> to develop a proper flash application you need a proper flash license
[11:26:19] <jyg> I'm mouseleave'ing a div, and when the mouse leaves I have to know if it moved to an adjacent container, or off of them both.  Unfortunately I cannot use .is(":hover") because it has shown to be unreliable.  I've been setting booleans on my DOM objects to keep track of what's doing on, but the problem is that, since I cannot test the actual, current hover state of the adjacent container, I cannot tell if once I've left the initial container whether I am on t
[11:26:29] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you will be at risk for litigation
[11:27:05] <kriestof> Whirl3d: Well, ok it's some solution. But at all it's not neat. If I don't find any solutio, I'll do it.
[11:27:15] <kriestof> solution*
[11:27:20] <BinaryKitten> jyg do you have a mutual parent around both?
[11:27:32] <jsonp_> i mean i got adobe creative suite
[11:27:34] <jsonp_> 5
[11:27:49] <jyg> BinaryKitten, i think so, lets assume that I do for the moment :)  what are you thinking?
[11:27:50] <BinaryKitten> i do hope you paid for that jsonp_, that's the license
[11:27:54] <jsonp_> well first of all im not gonna be hosting it
[11:27:59] <BinaryKitten> jyg bind to the parent
[11:28:17] <jyg> BinaryKittenm ah... seems so simple :)
[11:28:24] <jyg> thank you :)
[11:28:26] <BinaryKitten> jyg wood for trees
[11:28:53] <BinaryKitten> jsonp_ doesn't matter if you're not going to be hosting it
[11:28:58] <jsonp_> im going to make this app so people can get to thier porn cloud stash at work
[11:29:10] <BinaryKitten> you're going to need a license to use that software
[11:29:11] <jsonp_> why not
[11:29:41] <BinaryKitten> if you have adobe CS5 and no legitimate license then you are being logged right now
[11:29:53] <NoiseEee> porn and the workplace, finally united to unemploy thousands
[11:30:14] <jsonp_> ya
[11:30:20] <jsonp_> im gonna cause havoc
[11:30:23] <jsonp_> and mayhem
[11:30:29] <jsonp_> choas
[11:30:29] <Whirl3d> kriestof, I think it's best practice to wrap an image in a div when modifying it's dimensions...
[11:30:50] <jsonp_> im gonna give it away freely
[11:30:53] <tash> mbroadst: I added the <tfoot> section like in the example and here is my datatables code, http://pastebin.com/DJnps9hP, What is displayed is Total Hours: NaN ... do you see anything that is obviously wrong?
[11:31:11] <BinaryKitten> in the end jsonp_ you do what you want to do. I can only tell you that you need to legally buy the license for the software and not doing so, even if you give it away freely, can land you in court for rights infringment
[11:31:39] <BinaryKitten> but since you are now going to use flash jsonp_ that is no longer a topic for this channel
[11:31:42] <jyg> BinaryKitten, darn, no parent I can use.  initial container is a popup, generated way outside any possible parent candidate for your otherwise excellent idea
[11:31:50] <jsonp_> ok
[11:31:58] <jsonp_> is there a flash channel on freenode?
[11:32:02] <kriestof> Whirl3d: For what purpose, if we skip mine? :P
[11:32:02] <BinaryKitten> good luck jsonp_ you will need it
[11:32:09] <jsonp_> why do u keep saying that
[11:32:11] <BinaryKitten> google for it jsonp_
[11:32:22] <jsonp_> i said i got adobe cs5
[11:32:37] <MINTTU[MB]> anyone used hoverIntent before?
[11:32:44] * BinaryKitten places jsonp & jsonp on ignore
[11:33:16] <BinaryKitten> jyg hmm
[11:33:35] <BinaryKitten> how do you mean "popup" ?
[11:33:50] <jyg> when I used .is(':hover') it worked perfectly... but ie8 and ie7 have been balking at it
[11:34:21] <BinaryKitten> jyg yeah because under ie only certain elements can have the hover pseudo class
[11:34:23] <jyg> popup = bootstrap tooltip (tweaked)
[11:34:44] <tash> mbroadst: if you saw my pastebin, iTotalHours musts be undefined
[11:34:44] <BinaryKitten> jyg what about document in delegate mode?
[11:34:53] <tash> when I console.log it, it is NaN, whatever that is
[11:34:53] <BinaryKitten> hmm no
[11:35:08] <BinaryKitten> jyg not sure then
[11:35:17] <Haprog> NaN is Not a Number
[11:35:21] <BinaryKitten> sorry jyg
[11:36:49] * BinaryKitten departs
[11:36:55] <Haprog> tash: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN "It is rather rare to use NaN in a program. It is the returned value when Math functions fail (Math.sqrt(-1)) or when a function trying to parse a number fails (parseInt("blabla"))."
[11:36:55] <tash> mbroadst: wb
[11:37:28] <tash> Haprog, thanks ... so I guess i need help figuring this out so I can learn what I'm doing wrong.
[11:37:43] <tash> then make a mental note and hope I don't do it incorrectly again.
[11:37:50] <tash> mbroadst: did you see my pastebin?
[11:38:02] <eternalsword> tash, can you post your pastebin again?
[11:38:04] * jyg turns back to the screen and "doh!"s
[11:38:14] <tash> eternalsword: yes
[11:38:16] <tash> sec
[11:39:30] <tash> here is my datatables code ... http://pastebin.com/DJnps9hP and here is the <tfoot> I added between </tbody> and </table> http://pastebin.com/t32NiJVR
[11:39:45] <tash> I'm trying to sum 1 of the columns in my table ( the 10th column ) ...
[11:39:55] <tash> like they do here http://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/footer_callback.html
[11:40:01] <tash> eternalsword: ^
[11:40:20] <madtimber> is there anyway yet, to get a jquery wrapped version of "this" inside an event handler?  so I don't have to call $(this) every time?
[11:40:28] <tash> my iTotalHours var is "NaN"
[11:40:41] <tash> when I need it to be the sum of the column
[11:40:48] <ajpiano> madtimber: var $el = $(this);
[11:41:01] <madtimber> no no, I mean one that the handler exposes
[11:41:06] <madtimber> I realize I can cache a version of iit
[11:41:12] <madtimber> *it
[11:41:17] <gabejacobs> this should work right, for checking if a radio button is checked:
[11:41:21] <gabejacobs> if(document.getElementById('radio_yes').checked) {
[11:41:41] <asher^> why dont you do it in jquery?
[11:42:55] <tash> eternalsword: part of my problem is probably taking an example and trying to just mold it into my code without fully understanding it.
[11:43:11] <madtimber> ajpiano: thats still boilerplate code though.I want something passed into my handler that has it
[11:43:28] <ajpiano> there's nothing
[11:43:33] <madtimber> ajpiano: so like this:   function(e, wrappedObject) {}
[11:43:47] <ajpiano> we're not gonna construct jquery objects that might not ever be used by default
[11:43:54] <madtimber> ajpiano: kk.its been a while since I've read up on that, so didn't know if there was yet
[11:43:58] <ajpiano> madtimber: you could like, monkeypatch $.Event to include it
[11:44:05] <ajpiano> so that you get a property on your event object
[11:44:18] <madtimber> ajpiano: but you won;dnt have to construct it, you've already got it from when you bound the event handler
[11:44:53] <Posterdati> hi
[11:45:02] <ajpiano> yea but jquery doesn't  have it internally to pass it back to you
[11:45:22] <Posterdati> please I need to add a background to a jquery dialog, which css class have I to manipulate? thanks
[11:45:25] <ajpiano> moreover, you might *not* necessarily have a jquery object of *just* it
[11:45:47] <madtimber> ajpiano: right, if its a multi selector query
[11:46:29] <tash> eternalsword: I think the problem is the mat in the for()
[11:46:43] <tash> but I took that straight from the example ... know what I'm doing wrong?
[11:48:08] <jeffsmykil> anyone used fabricjs for a project?
[11:49:12] <eternalsword> Posterdati: .ui-dialog?
[11:49:34] <Posterdati> background-image: ?
[11:50:10] <bogardi> How would I make multiple raindrops that appear in different x positions animate to the bottom of the window.  I have one raindrop down: http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/ but I don't know to make multiple raindrops act differently
[11:50:46] <Haprog> you need a simple particle engine
[11:51:11] <eternalsword> bogardi, http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/3/ ?
[11:51:28] <bogardi> ah perfect
[11:51:51] <bogardi> thank you
[11:52:11] <monkeybite> Hi there! I have alot of data which I want to represent in two lists. Between them I would like to drag elements back and forth, and filter + search in them individually. Is there any good plugin for this functionality?
[11:53:08] <bogardi> how could I vary the speed of each one? :)
[11:54:11] <eternalsword> bogardi, add a speed variable to the animate parameters.  I'll leave up to you to figure out how you want to generate the speeds.
[11:54:40] <tash> eternalsword: did you happen to see my pastebins and comments?
[11:54:55] <jeffsmykil> wouldnt rain drops all have the same falling velocity
[11:54:58] <eternalsword> tash, sorry got called away from my desk.
[11:55:02] <jeffsmykil> they just leave at different times
[11:55:27] <jedimind> eternalsword, bogardi though keep in mind that gravity is a constant and raindrops (much like all things) fall at a constant speed
[11:55:40] <jedimind> so if you start playing with the duration, its going to look unrealistic
[11:55:43] <jedimind> just saying
[11:55:59] <jeffsmykil> YOURE JUST SAYING EXACTLY WHAT I SAID ;)
[11:56:04] <jedimind> NO
[11:56:11] <jedimind> oh yeah, i didnt read what you wrote
[11:56:14] <bogardi> yeah I guess I'm not looking to change the speed, just the start time? so not all the raindrops start at the same time
[11:56:19] <jedimind> so, in summation, what jeff said
[11:56:26] <eternalsword> bogardi: what you might want to do instead is use a timeout to vary the frequency
[11:56:38] <jeffsmykil> god the fabric documentation is so bad
[11:56:50] <tash> eternalsword: should I repost so you don't have to scroll back?
[11:57:05] <eternalsword> tash, I have your pastebins, what part are you having trouble with?
[11:57:51] <Haprog> jedimind: ofcourse raindrops don't fall at a constant speed but at an increasing speed because of gravity..
[11:57:59] <jedimind> Haprog, uhm
[11:58:07] <jedimind> chances are when YOU see them, they're falling at a constant speed
[11:58:13] <jedimind> because of something called terminal velocity
[11:58:23] <jedimind> they only accelerate to a certain speed, then fall at that constant speed
[11:58:25] <tash> i want to output the sum of the 10th column in the tfoot
[11:58:32] <tash> so, iTotalHours
[11:58:32] <jedimind> but lets not get overly technical
[11:58:34] <Haprog> ah, ofc
[11:58:37] <jedimind> :)
[11:58:49] <tash> but when I innerhtml it, it comes out as "NaN" instead of numbers
[11:59:09] <tash> so, I console.log'd that var after the for() loops and the var is equating to "NaN"
[11:59:26] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. i've been playing around with bootstrap but am having an issue getting the javascript within bootstrap to work. I am new to js so this could be super noob of me, but when I follow their example and include their code to initialize the tabbable code, I get an error that $ is not defined
[11:59:44] <bogardi> yoiu don't have the jquery properly linked up
[11:59:49] <tash> eternalsword: I mean, I have a column in my table, the 10th column, and I want to output the sum results into the footer
[11:59:59] <LindsayMac> bogardi:  thats the strange thing.. its showing just fine.
[12:00:18] <eternalsword> tash, what is aaData?
[12:00:21] <LindsayMac> bogardi:  i'm using the google jquery path //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[12:00:35] <jeffsmykil> wtf is e.memo
[12:01:08] <tash> eternalsword: that's part of the problem really. I'm trying to use the example and put it in my code, but I don't know what it all means. So, I don't know what aaData is
[12:01:17] <tash> the example is http://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/footer_callback.html
[12:01:18] <bogardi> eternalsword: would I set a timeout on the each function or the animate function?
[12:01:37] <eternalsword> LindsayMac: you either don't have jQuery loaded, or it is in safe-mode.  Try jQuery instead of $ and see if that changes anything.
[12:01:37] <jeffsmykil> I wish I was making raindrops :(
[12:01:47] <Haprog> LindsayMac: then you're probably trying to use $ before the jquery lib is loaded.
[12:02:01] <jSlack> jeffsmykil: Learn 2 myspace
[12:02:07] <LindsayMac> Haprog:  nope.. i initialized the script AFTER i called jquery...
[12:02:11] <jeffsmykil> jSlack: ?
[12:02:13] <LindsayMac> eternalsword:  let me look in to safemode
[12:02:17] <jSlack> It's a joke
[12:02:26] <jSlack> about putting raindrops on myspace pages as work
[12:02:28] <LindsayMac> whats strange is that there is NOTHING else on that page. No other scripts, etc
[12:02:33] <jeffsmykil> oh
[12:02:38] <monkeybite> Hi there! I have alot of data which I want to represent in two lists. Between them I would like to drag elements back and forth, and filter + search in them individually. Is there any good plugin for this functionality? Can't find any where you can filter/search easily
[12:02:54] <Haprog> LindsayMac: can you link the page or show the code?
[12:03:21] <LindsayMac> OMG i just figured it out! weird.. type in the url which caused the url to still show the code appropriately within the <script> tags but for some reason wasn't playing well
[12:03:47] <LindsayMac> So when i viewed in firebug, the code from the google lib. was there.. but the browser wasn't actually seeing it. Or something weird like that
[12:04:15] <eternalsword> bogardi, if you do it on each, the varyance will stay the same.  if you do it on each and on the $.animate callback, it will stay randomized.
[12:06:18] <eternalsword> tash, instead of iTotalHours += aaData[i][9]*1; try iTotalHours += aaData[aiDisplay[i]][9]*1;
[12:06:33] <cbobo> How can I see all the binds that I have for a specific #id ?
[12:07:19] <tash> eternalsword: k
[12:07:43] <eternalsword> cbobo, http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/debug-jquery-events-with-listhandlers/ ?
[12:08:06] <bogardi> eternalsword: I got it to work http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/9/ but it needs adjusting, I think it's waiting till the animation is finished to do the next one
[12:08:15] <tash> eternalsword: same result unfortunately
[12:14:27] <eternalsword> bogardi, http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/10/
[12:15:38] <MimiEA> eternalsword : awesome :)
[12:16:39] <bogardi> did you update? it looks good but it's not realistic because it needs a continuous stream of raindrops at different times
[12:16:53] <eternalsword> yeah, I noticed that.
[12:16:57] <eternalsword> thinking
[12:19:21] <MimiEA> eternalsword : maybe removing and adding the raindrop divs ...
[12:21:14] <tash> eternalsword: any other tips?
[12:29:34] <monkeybite> Okey then. Is there any easy way to sort a list by adding sort asc, desc etc buttons?
[12:35:49] <bogardi> he's using set interval: http://robproject.com/blog/tag/jquery-rain/
[12:39:41] <nickSwe> I am showing a DIV when I click on a BUTTON, but when I click anywhere ELSE on the page body I want to hide the DIV. So I use this: $('body, .cMenu button').click(function() { // hide my div }  but how can I prevent it from being runned when I click my BUTTON to show the DIV?
[12:42:48] <jasabelle> is there a jquery plugin for resizable div?
[12:42:54] <eternalsword> bogardi, http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/12/
[12:43:12] <jasabelle> a borderlayout sorta thing
[12:43:20] <tash> eternalsword: did you see that what you suggested unfortunately gave me the same "NaN" result?
[12:43:28] <bogardi> damn badass eternalsword! thanks
[12:44:00] <eternalsword> bogardi, http://jsfiddle.net/rHNRL/13/ for scrollbar fix
[12:44:02] <tash> not sure what I should do, doesn't help that I don't exactly know what aaData is
[12:47:15] <eternalsword> tash, yeah.  try doing a console.log of aaData in the for loop might give an idea of what you need.
[12:47:43] <eternalsword> or rather outside the for loop
[12:48:07] <eternalsword> should print the whole object to the console
[12:50:18] <tash> eternalsword; k
[12:51:42] <tash> eternalsword: looks like aaData is all of the html in the table ... all the inputs, etc.
[12:52:23] <eternalsword> in the for loop, try doing console log of aaData[ aiDisplay[i] ]
[12:52:36] <tash> k
[12:55:42] <tash> eternalsword: looks like that returns the html of a specific row ... every column
[12:56:43] <tash> I. Am. An. Idiot.
[12:56:53] <tash> I was telling it to caclulate the WRONG column, sighs
[13:03:26] <bogardi> how would I improve the performance? heh
[13:03:32] <bogardi> too many animations
[13:03:40] <tash> eternalsword: it seems like everything we just did is correctly to get the total calculation even outside of pagination...but to get just what is shown on the current page, the datatables example says to use aaData[ aiDisplay[i] ][x]*1 where x is the column.
[13:03:44] <tash> I think we just used that code to show all
[13:04:07] <tash> weird, I'm now trying to just show only the current page's results based on their example and it is still getting me the entire total
[13:05:37] <eternalsword> tash, I see, the for conditions change, for obvious reasons.  I didn't notice they had a pages loop and a total loop.
[13:06:00] <tash> i'm such a liar
[13:06:11] <tash> n/m everything I just said
[13:06:15] <tash> ugh
[13:07:03] <eternalsword> bogardi, unfortunately, the only way to improve performance would be to use canvas+svg instead.
[13:08:40] <bogardi> would it improve the performance drastically?
[13:08:41] <eternalsword> the other problem with the animation is that the raindrops get bunched together when you leave for another tab and go back.  you can detect focus and blur on window, but not if it's in an iframe.  You'll can use window.top, if they are on the same domain.
[13:08:52] <eternalsword> bogardi: I
[13:09:21] <eternalsword> I'm not sure, haven't played too much with canvas, and haven't done or seen benchmarking.
[13:11:35] <eternalsword> it may only be marginal. and to be honest there may be no gain at all. It's the only possibility I could think of. I should have phrased better earlier.
[13:13:20] <pawn> is there other methods besides prepend, append, after and before for inserting elements into the DOM; specifically, a method that let's me specifify an index that the inserted element must have amongst it's siblings?
[13:13:23] <eternalsword> shows what I know, canvas and svg are two separate things.
[13:13:24] <bogardi> okay thanks for the help
[13:13:49] <bogardi> well you would use svg to draw the drops and canvas for the animation
[13:14:46] <eternalsword> bogardi, you could try using css3 animations too.
[13:15:52] <eternalsword> I don't think that would show any gains though.
[13:16:30] <pawn> Is there a way to prevent the click event from triggering when using jQuery UI's sortables?
[13:17:47] <eternalsword> e.preventDefault assuming e passed to the function ...'click', function(e)...
[13:18:04] <eternalsword> should be e.preventDefault();
[13:18:29] <eternalsword> if you don't want text to be selectable, that's something different.
[13:18:53] <jfisk87> if i wanted to get a child of me.$node('friendlistShell'), how would i do so?
[13:19:40] <fission6> how do i select all li sibilings and the li currently being hovered over?
[13:20:00] <fission6> i want to remove a Class from all li's if a current li on the same dom level is being hovered over
[13:22:06] <silverwind> fission6, something like $(this).siblings('li:not(:hover)'); I guess
[13:22:13] <silverwind> Not sure..
[13:22:25] <fission6> ehhh
[13:22:41] <fission6> i just did $this.parent('ul').children('li') for now
[13:22:48] <NoiseEee> that would be appropriate fission6
[13:24:19] <eternalsword> fission6: are you removing the class from all the li's including the hovered one?
[13:25:14] <eternalsword> if so, use the mouseover event, then $(this).siblings() will get you all the li within.
[13:25:17] <CrawlBot> hey everyone
[13:25:31] <fission6> eternalsword: yes
[13:25:41] <fission6> i have some code hang on
[13:41:25] <fission6> here you go, it seems to work fine i just fine it a little 'wordy' in terms of code http://dpaste.org/5IwiF/
[13:42:54] <CrawlBot> hi I'm trying to display a JSON replied from a WCF service but nothing appears in the Results div :(, The javascript must be off, here you can see what it is supposed to get on the first line: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1698895
[13:46:47] <ryanneufeld> CrawlBot: don't use jquery-latest for production, unless you want it to auto update and possibly break your code. There are big changes coming 1.8 so YMMV
[13:47:20] <ryanneufeld> CrawlBot: string is a reserved word
[13:47:30] <fission6> whats a good way to link a ul with li's of values to hidden form input field? should i give each li a data-target value to map it to a form input
[13:47:51] <fission6> basically how can i map li data atttributes to a hidden input
[13:48:02] <ryanneufeld> CrawlBot: and you don't need to var string = transport. transport will be an object, if you console.log(transport) and inspect the results you'll be able to see what your data are

[13:48:23] <FrozenFire> I have custom-coded pop-up modal dialogs that I need to have hide when the user clicks anywhere else. I had tried calling .focus() on them after showing them, and then binding an event to hide them on .blur(), but that's not working. Any ideas?

[13:50:46] <CrawlBot> ryanneufeld, well I modified the code a bit, removed the private "string" variable and put jquery 1.7.2  but still isn't working :( http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1698903
[13:50:47] <ryanneufeld> fission6: no
[13:50:56] <ryanneufeld> FrozenFire: ?demo
[13:51:19] <ryanneufeld> CrawlBot: var strData = transport isn't needed
[13:51:25] <Adalric> Question for you all: I have two buttons that open two different divs using slideToggle. I'm having a hard time figuring out how to close one opened div if I press on the other div's button. Any clues on how to achieve this? I'm pretty new to JS.
[13:51:36] <ryanneufeld> CrawlBot: try doing a console.log(transport)
[13:51:39] <fission6> ryanneufeld: i want to use a data-value from an li element and map i tto a hidden form input field
[13:52:04] <ryanneufeld> fission6: map it how?
[13:52:14] <Adalric> This is what I have so far: http://pastie.org/4227871
[13:52:18] <fission6> i have a ul where each li is a "star" image and i am using it as a rating system, when the user clicks a certain li, i want t map the rating given to a hidden form input
[13:52:21] <fission6> ryanneufeld: ^
[13:52:48] <fission6> so think 5 stars, user clicks 4th star, i want the hidden form input's value to be 4
[13:52:59] <ryanneufeld> fission6: ah, okay. that's not too hard, I'v actually done just that
[13:53:02] <Kreol[Ukr]> <ryanneufeld> hm, so i can't do it? or try ajaxSetup({async = false}) ?
[13:53:22] <ryanneufeld> Kreol[Ukr]: no don't do that. In 1.8 that won't be available anymore

[13:53:40] <fission6> thats my js
[13:53:40] <ryanneufeld> Kreol[Ukr]: ^^^ read that. Come back with questions
[13:54:09] <fission6> i figured i could map it a number of ways but curious if there is a good pattern for this, was thinking either data-target attribute on each li, or just mapping one to one on a submit handler
[13:54:13] <ryanneufeld> fission6: so, what I do for simplicity, is have data-rating='1'
[13:54:24] <ryanneufeld> fission6: and so on for each li
[13:54:31] <fission6> right thats what i do
[13:54:40] <fission6> and i store the selected value as data-select on the ul
[13:54:47] <ryanneufeld> fission6: can you get a reduced example on jsfiddle for me?
[13:54:54] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @fission6
[13:54:55] <bot-t> fission6, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:54:59] <Adalric> Any help?
[13:55:21] <fission6> im just curious how you mapped the li values to the hidden input form field?
[13:55:28] <fission6> when the form was submitted
[13:56:05] <eternalsword> fission6: you can just use var $starList = $star.siblings('li').add($star); instead
[13:56:07] <int> I am trying to send some json via POST. For some reason the content type is not being set to json. https://gist.github.com/3077206
[13:56:12] <int> can anyone help?
[13:56:15] <ryanneufeld> fission6: $('#InputsId').val(clickedLi.data('rating'));
[13:56:43] <int> it is a cross-domain request which I am allowing on the server side.
[13:56:44] <fission6> ok
[13:57:01] <fission6> thanks eternalsword and ryanneufeld i think ill just get something in place / overthinking this
[13:57:01] <ryanneufeld> int: is that ruby?
[13:57:14] <int> if I explicitly set the contentType to application/json, then I just see a OPTIONS request instead of a POST request
[13:57:16] <ryanneufeld> fission6: yeah, it's really simple
[13:57:38] <xboi209> How do I run scripts on certain pages?
[13:57:39] <ryanneufeld> int: are you using ruby server side?
[13:57:39] <int> ryanneufeld: python, but the main problem lies in the 2nd half of the gist, the jquery bit
[13:57:55] <int> it's python, flask framework
[13:58:18] <ryanneufeld> int: hmm. I'm not sure.  does it do the same in all browsers?
[13:58:24] <danzik17> int: is this a crossdomain request?
[13:58:30] <int> danzik17: yes it is
[13:58:48] <ryanneufeld> xdomain post should be fine
[13:59:02] <ryanneufeld> and he's seeing the data get posted. just with the wrong content type
[13:59:35] <int> why does the request become OPTIONS instead of POST when I set it explicitly
[13:59:45] <ryanneufeld> int: setting dataType is for what you expect from the server
[13:59:53] <ryanneufeld> int: that doesn't set the outgoing header
[13:59:53] <int> and why can't I get to set it to JSON? I also tried data:JSON.stringify(data)
[13:59:54] <fission6> ryanneufeld: well it easy i am just trying to avoidn messy code, for now i am going to capture the form handler and just explicitly map the fields
[14:00:00] <fission6> form submit handler
[14:00:04] <ryanneufeld> fission6: yeah, that's the ticket
[14:00:14] <danzik17> int: what version of jquery btw?
[14:00:14] <ryanneufeld> fission6: you don't need to do that though
[14:00:37] <int> danzik17: 1.7.2
[14:00:47] <eternalsword> int, you want contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" probably
[14:01:04] <ryanneufeld> int: contentTypeString
[14:01:06] <int> eternalsword: like I said, when I do that, there is no POST
[14:01:13] <int> only OPTIONS
[14:01:18] <int> which I am not even sure what it is
[14:01:19] <ryanneufeld> int: contentType: 'application/json'
[14:01:29] <FrozenFire> Hrmm, trying to use .focusout() to catch when an element is losing focus, but it seems to be firing when its children are selected.
[14:01:35] <int> yep, did that too and getting the OPTIONS problem
[14:01:38] <int> instead of a POST
[14:01:43] <fission6> ryanneufeld: what do you mean?
[14:01:47] <int> it goes as POST if I don't set the contentType though
[14:01:55] <int> only the contentType is set wrong
[14:02:06] <ryanneufeld> fission6: you can have the form submit by calling .submit() from the click handler on the stars
[14:02:13] <ryanneufeld> fission6: if you only have the stars in your form
[14:02:32] <ryanneufeld> fission6: but if you want to do it with ajax you need to handle the form submit too
[14:02:32] <int> been scratching my head all day with this
[14:03:25] <fission6> ryanneufeld: i need to map the rating to form fields first then submit
[14:03:38] <ryanneufeld> fission6: yeah, so write your code in that order
[14:03:56] <eternalsword> int, I had problems using json as well, ended up using JSON.stringify and then instead of data: data, data: 'data=' + data and then using json_decode(stripslashes(POST['data'])) on the server
[14:04:26] <ryanneufeld> int: try contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",

[14:05:50] <HolyDiver> hello guys
[14:06:05] <HolyDiver> chrome says $(window) is not a valid thingie
[14:06:25] <HolyDiver> anyone has an idea?
[14:06:28] <danzik17> int: what header does the server see if you don't explicitly set one in this case?   it sounds like in one case, a xdomain preflight request is being sent ( which is being unhandled ), and in the other case a POST is being sent
[14:06:40] <NoiseEee> HolyDiver: awesome error message
[14:06:58] <ryanneufeld> NoiseEee: Can I see a screenshot of that error?
[14:07:01] <int> ryanneufeld: I did try setting that contentType like I said
[14:07:06] <HolyDiver> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function
[14:07:13] <eternalsword> HolyDiver: jquery likely isn't loaded.
[14:07:24] <int> eternalsword: what's causing this though?
[14:07:25] <HolyDiver> damn. it says it is
[14:07:28] <ryanneufeld> int: did you try it with the charset? also read that link, there is a method for woring with the xhr that might help
[14:07:45] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: yup, looks like jquery isn't loaded
[14:07:45] <int> ryanneufeld: yes with and without the charset
[14:07:53] <ryanneufeld> ?ftjq @ HolyDiver
[14:07:53] <bot-t> HolyDiver, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:07:53] <pawn> eternalsword: I'm talking about sortables. Which event should I put e.preventDefault in?
[14:07:55] <HolyDiver> may i give the address?
[14:08:23] <HolyDiver> i'm a little lost because query appears to be loaded first.
[14:08:24] <ryanneufeld> int: hmm.. did you try the beforeSend callback? You can manipulate the xhr that way
[14:08:25] <eternalsword> int, don't know.  i needed to pass more than just json as it turns out, so I never bothered going back.
[14:08:47] <eternalsword> HolyDiver, how about jQuery(window) ?
[14:09:32] <HolyDiver> let me see
[14:10:31] <int> danzik17: if I don't set a contentType. It's a POST request with formurlencoded
[14:10:36] <eternalsword> pawn, the click event.  or do you mean you want to stop the sortable from dragging in a certains scenario?
[14:10:45] <int> danzik17: if I set the contentType, there is not even a POST but a OPTIONS instead
[14:11:03] <HolyDiver> and again
[14:11:34] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: check your console for 404 errors
[14:11:40] <HolyDiver> none
[14:11:44] <ryanneufeld> link
[14:11:52] <HolyDiver> http://mrfinncontentworks.com
[14:12:31] <danzik17> int: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control explains all of it.  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is considered a "simple" request and does not require a pre-flight request.  "application/json" is handled differently and does - give it a read.
[14:13:18] <pawn> eternalsword: I want to stop the click event when dragging on an element.
[14:14:12] <pawn> eternalsword: I have a click event for element X, I also have sortable declared on element X, I want to prevent the click event for element X when the sortable events are invoked.
[14:14:17] <int> eternalsword: I tried the "data=" bit. Still the same issue
[14:15:00] <silverwind> int, do you even JSON.stringify the object?
[14:15:24] <eternalsword> int, could be cherrypy as well assuming that's what you're using.
[14:16:00] <HolyDiver> did u get that, ryanneufeld?
[14:16:11] <int> silverwind: I tried that, yes
[14:16:18] <int> eternalsword: I am using flask
[14:16:42] <eternalsword> pawn, okay http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3433366/jquery-sortable-disable-onclick-while-sorting
[14:16:43] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: you're using wordpress... That's why.
[14:16:51] <HolyDiver> yup
[14:16:56] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: read your html dude
[14:17:00] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: the answer is in there
[14:17:31] <ryanneufeld> also, jquer(window).load().... NO
[14:17:34] <HolyDiver> let's see. it includes the wordpress included in query first
[14:17:35] <HolyDiver> isnt it?
[14:17:46] <HolyDiver> ryanneufeld, i tried it because someone told me so in here, didn't work either :)
[14:17:50] <HolyDiver> i was using $(window)
[14:18:08] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: use $(function(){//code goes here});
[14:18:18] <eternalsword> HolyDiver: you have jquery loading twice.  your theme should use enqueue_script
[14:18:18] <ryanneufeld> yes, window.load is bad
[14:18:32] <fission6> ryanneufeld: i just stuck the input hidden field next to the <ul> and came up with http://dpaste.org/WJMmF/ noting line 27 where i map the clicked li to the input field - its still feels a bit verbose but its clean enough and works.
[14:18:34] <ryanneufeld> eternalsword: I was trying to lead him to that himself :P
[14:18:37] <HolyDiver> yay
[14:18:40] <HolyDiver> but with it once
[14:18:43] <HolyDiver> it fails as well
[14:18:44] <HolyDiver> :/
[14:19:03] <HolyDiver> in fact, i did put it there because with the wordpress query only
[14:19:14] <HolyDiver> it loaded later than with two. don't ask me why.
[14:19:15] <ryanneufeld> The source I'm seeing, isn't loading it twice
[14:19:20] <HolyDiver> was just a desperate try
[14:19:37] <ryanneufeld> the thing is I think wordpress actually calls no conflict
[14:20:13] <pawn>  eternalsword: Thanks, I'll give this a shot. I wonder why JUI wouldn't have this sort of functionality to begin with.
[14:20:33] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: put this in your themes functions.php http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1698935
[14:20:39] <ajpiano> pawn: there
[14:20:40] <ajpiano> is
[14:20:40] <ryanneufeld> somewhere near the top
[14:21:21] <HolyDiver> oh
[14:21:22] <HolyDiver> it worked
[14:21:40] <ajpiano> pawn: wait no, never mind, i got it backward , sorry
[14:21:58] <andrew9184> has anyone seen any cool effects for showing an about us (team) page?
[14:22:33] <pawn> ajpiano: ?
[14:22:54] <ajpiano> pawn: i thought you wanted to allow for click events, without triggering the sortable from starting
[14:22:58] <pawn> eternalsword: That solution doesn't work because I'm not using the onclick property.
[14:23:14] <silverwind> int, do you have the "processData" option set to false?
[14:24:14] <ajpiano> pawn: what are you trying to accomplish? have the handle be clickable in addition to being the sort handle?
[14:26:56] <int> silverwind: just tried that. Same thing
[14:27:01] <int> argh
[14:27:55] <mister_m> if I have  a handle on an element that I selected with a class selector - in this case it is bound to $(this) - how can I access a single div tag that is a child of $(this)
[14:27:59] <mister_m> how would I select it
[14:28:14] <HolyDiver> thank you, ryanneufeld
[14:28:28] <ryanneufeld> HolyDiver: hope it helps
[14:28:37] <HolyDiver> ryanneufeld, it's fixed :)
[14:28:43] <ryanneufeld> Yay!
[14:29:21] <silverwind> int:$.ajax({ url: 'theurl', processData: false, contentType: 'application/json', type: 'POST', data: JSON.stringify(myObject)}) :/ should work :(
[14:30:43] <ryanneufeld> int: did you try manipulating the xhr like I suggested? Also, does it perform the same in all browsers?
[14:30:51] <mister_m> essentially I want to do a very limited .find('div')
[14:34:00] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to implement sortable tables... I'm thinking tablesorter... anyone have any other suggestions?
[14:34:17] <starsinmypockets> I'm also at least partly curious to do my own implementation...
[14:34:34] <eternalsword> pawn, sorry, assumed you knew enough to figure it out from there.  what you want to do is ensure your click handler is referenceable then in start: do an unbind on the element you need to, then in the stop: do a bind on it again.  you'll want to use $('#sortable').on('click', [your selector], handler) and $('#sortable').off('click', [your selector], handler) respectively if using latest jquery
[14:35:17] <int> ryanneufeld: I don't have any other browser installed.
[14:35:28] <mister_m> nvm, I can pass a selector to .children()
[14:35:39] <ryanneufeld> int: well, that's an easy problem to solve. And the rest of my questions?

[14:37:37] <ryanneufeld> scroll down. see the beforeSend
[14:38:09] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: any idea why changing the contentType on an ajax request would be coming through as an OPTIONS request vs POST?
[14:38:38] <ajpiano> uhm, nope
[14:38:49] <ryanneufeld> same here
[14:38:50] <ajpiano> maybe it's triggering cors on the server, i have no context
[14:39:04] <ryanneufeld> int's working with flask, trying to sort it out
[14:39:24] <ajpiano> i can't look right now sorry
[14:39:29] <ryanneufeld> np
[14:41:38] <int> ryanneufeld: tried that. Again makes it OPTIONS instead of PSOT
[14:41:40] <int> *POST
[14:42:05] <int> I wonder if it's a server side issue as opposed to jquery
[14:42:08] <ryanneufeld> int: are you inspecting the headers? How do you tell it's OPTIONS?
[14:42:14] <int> firebug
[14:42:35] <ryanneufeld> do you have a demo?
[14:42:59] <int> ryanneufeld: what do you mean?
[14:43:11] <ryanneufeld> can I see this code in action somewhere?
[14:43:17] <int> no :(
[14:43:22] <int> it's just local atm
[14:43:37] <int> ryanneufeld: do you know python/flask?
[14:43:43] <ryanneufeld> no

[14:44:14] <int> I am using http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/56/ for the crossdomain
[14:44:22] <int> if that's any help
[14:46:46] <ryanneufeld> int: Do you not see "OPTIONS" there?
[14:47:17] <pawn> what's the default jquery animation easing?
[14:47:25] <silverwind> linear..
[14:48:13] <eternalsword> int, try setting type to text and using data: 'data=' + JSON.stringify(data) then in python reference POST['data'].  let's make sure the basics are working.
[14:48:28] <pawn> ajpiano, eternalsword: I figured out how to make it work, the click event that is. Thanks. :)
[14:48:37] <ajpiano> pawn:  was it the "distance" option?
[14:49:15] <TrentonDAdams> Why would $(selector) or $(selector).get() return a non-null and defined object, when it doesn't match any element?  is that expected?
[14:49:33] <ryanneufeld> int: I'm inspecting some json contenttype ajax requests. And it they are coming through as post
[14:50:06] <Jon47> TrentonDAdams: yea that's expected, both of those elements are chainable so the jquery object is returned
[14:50:13] <int> ryanneufeld: i have a different project and everything is fine in that
[14:50:16] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: the first returns an empty jQuery object, the second returns the underlying empty array
[14:50:19] <Jon47> er, s/elements/methods/
[14:50:21] <int> except I am not doing crossdomain requests in it
[14:50:26] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: yeah, just figured that out. :D
[14:50:34] <int> so I am thinking it's an issue with it being cross-domain
[14:50:36] <TrentonDAdams> I was like "hey, I wonder if that's an empty array".
[14:50:46] <TrentonDAdams> thanks.

[14:55:26] <ryanneufeld> int: looking at the headers from that, I can see that the content type is JSON, and the request method is POST
[14:55:32] <Adalric> Hey guys, how do you change the mouse/keyboard focus to a form that is shown after pressing a button?
[14:55:35] <Broote> h'lo all
[14:55:36] <iliketurtles> in the following snippit, should the commented out $(self) var represent an object matching .comments?         $(".comments").click(function() { //$(self) }());
[14:55:53] <faryshta> Hi I am having issues with this script http://pastebin.com/mg1r7bJs it works fine while you are at the tab. But when you leave for a minute and then get back it start to move at random.
[14:56:03] <ryanneufeld> int: so it looks like like your jquery is probably okay, but you need to stringify your data so that the body of the request is properly encoded json
[14:56:10] <eternalsword> int, looks like cross domain uses OPTIONS first to veriry with server that posting is allowed and then follows up with a POST.  Looks like it's not passing the handshake.
[14:56:52] <int> ryanneufeld: but not setting the contentType actually does a succesful POST
[14:57:03] <int> and I am using JSON.stringy
[14:57:16] <ryanneufeld> int: what browser are you using?
[14:57:25] <ryanneufeld> int: have you tried in other browsers
[14:57:35] <int> so I dunno why it would fail if I setup the contentType or why jquery won't setup the conent type to json on it's own
[14:57:37] <int> firefox
[14:57:37] <caniuse> int: http://wil.to/_/firefox.gif
[14:57:55] <ryanneufeld> int: what version of ff?
[14:58:08] <int> 13
[14:58:23] * ryanneufeld tests in ff13
[14:58:48] <int> ryanneufeld: are you testing cross domain?
[14:58:54] <int> thanks btw, highly appreciated
[14:59:26] <ryanneufeld> int: Yeah, it's POST when it leaves FF
[14:59:34] <ryanneufeld> problem seems to be on the server side mate.
[14:59:52] <eternalsword> int, my guess is with contentType set to json, the OPTIONS handshake is failing.
[15:00:08] <pawn> silverwind: Found in the docs it was the 'swing' easing.
[15:00:19] <pawn> ajpiano: Was what?
[15:00:34] <ajpiano> pawn: the way you got your click thing to work
[15:00:45] <ryanneufeld> int: OH... xdomain it does change to OPTIONS
[15:01:19] <ryanneufeld> int: what you need to be testing for is Access-Control-Request-Method == POST
[15:01:46] <ryanneufeld> Which is probably why the author of the  python code you're using is checking OPTIONS
[15:01:54] <Broote> Im trying to call a function to add scrollbars to a div I just updated via ajax, but only when a class exists.  So something like $('.needsScrollBars').on('load', function() { ... });  Im sure it doesnt work because the load event isnt triggered in the divs im getting from Ajax.  How would I update those as they appear though?
[15:01:59] <ryanneufeld> also he is testing the Access-Control* stuff
[15:02:29] <pawn> ajpiano: Oh no. That option isn't relavent. I got the click handler to work by just setting an isBeingSorted data field on the element, then checking this in the click handler.
[15:02:42] <pawn> However, I'm thinking of using a bind/unbind approach
[15:03:29] <pawn> If I do .on('click', 'selector', handler); then off('click', handler); then .on('click', handler); will the selector be maintained for the click handler?
[15:03:44] <faryshta> Hi I am having issues with this script http://pastebin.com/mg1r7bJs when you leave for a minute and then get back it start to move at random.
[15:05:53] <Broote> I love how sometimes just asking the question helps you find the answer
[15:05:54] <nFFF> Broote
[15:06:00] <Broote> thanks hehe :)
[15:06:02] <nFFF> put it in your callback
[15:06:08] <nFFF> oh ok you got it
[15:06:14] <Broote> yea, i only just now realised i was doing it wrong
[15:06:18] <Broote> hehe
[15:06:48] <hangal> Hi I need to make a crossdomain request for $(...).load -- how can I specify this? I successfully made crossdomain calls with $.ajax using beforeSend: xhr.withCredentials = true
[15:07:05] <hangal> however, I don't know how to use this method with $.load
[15:07:34] <hangal> Is there a way out? Thanks.
[15:07:42] <eternalsword> pawn, no the selector would not be maintained.
[15:07:47] <TrentonDAdams> Why does the jQuery plugin use the function ($) { blah }(jQuery) syntax, instead of just jQuery object directly?
[15:07:56] <TrentonDAdams> jQuery plugin example I mean.
[15:08:04] <TrentonDAdams> At http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Namespacing
[15:08:47] <eternalsword> TrentonDAdams: that way, the plugin works even if $ is not assigned to jQuery
[15:08:50] <TrentonDAdams> I can see using something sorter for general code.  But, for plugins, it seems a little clearer to be using jQuery, rather than $.
[15:09:02] <int> ryanneufeld: so what exactly are you suggesting I do?
[15:09:08] <danzik17> TrentonDAdams: someone could have called noConflict, so $ isn't available in the global scope.  that and it's good to get a closure to store any private vars you need for your plugin.
[15:09:09] <TrentonDAdams> Right, but I'm suggesting not using $ at all.
[15:09:17] <int> ryanneufeld: also I should tell you that I am just running the html as a local file
[15:09:24] <int> not hosted on a server, just a local file
[15:09:27] <int> is that the issue?
[15:09:36] <TrentonDAdams> I mean just for plugins though.  In my normal code, I like something short.
[15:09:36] <ryanneufeld> int: which, your source?
[15:09:54] <ryanneufeld> int: no, that shouldn't matter, cause jquery builds the xhr for you
[15:10:11] <ryanneufeld> int: my guess is that you've missed something in the server side code.
[15:10:24] <danzik17> int: did you read the link i posted like an hour ago?  it explains the problem you're having and how to solve it.
[15:10:35] <TrentonDAdams> danzik17: Right, so I'm fine using jQuery directly then, because if someone uses noConflict(), I don't really care then, right?
[15:10:48] <jeffreylevesque> what's wrong with this  sytnax: $(el).closest('.form-item').children('.option').text() == 'N/A'?
[15:11:33] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, nothing, what makes you think its wrong? it's most likely your selectors
[15:11:42] <faryshta> jeffreylevesque, is el a string?
[15:11:46] <eternalsword> TrentonDAdams: why make it long in plugin development?  should use $ in plugins and jQuery outside imo to ensure compatibility.
[15:11:47] <danzik17> TrentonDAdams: you can use whatever you want, especially if you use a closure as they do in the example.    (function(banana){ banana.find("#foo"); }(jQuery)) will work just as well =P
[15:12:02] <jeffreylevesque> faryshta: http://pastebin.com/0fMTkExe
[15:12:12] <Broote> jeffreylevesque: possibly selecting more then one element?
[15:13:12] <danzik17> TrentonDAdams: IIFE, not closure - terminology snafu on my part.  tired.
[15:13:19] <TrentonDAdams> danzik17: eternalsword: Why even use (function(anything){banana.find("#foo"); }(jQuery)) ????  Why not just jQuery.find("#foo");   ????
[15:13:30] <jeffreylevesque> Broote: what do you mean selecting more than one element?
[15:13:36] <ryanneufeld> jeffreylevesque: syntax? nothing is wrong with the syntax. it's syntacticaly fine
[15:13:45] <ajpiano> because that's how javascript works and it affords you the ability to use a safe shorthand inside of your function
[15:13:47] <TrentonDAdams> danzik17: eternalsword: Plugins should be compatible when using jQuery directly, ALWAYS, unless jQuery changed the name of it, in which case all syntaxes would fail
[15:13:51] <faryshta> jeffreylevesque, is ".option" an input, select or other form element?
[15:14:06] <Broote> ^
[15:14:10] <TrentonDAdams> danzik17: eternalsword: Is that not true?
[15:14:32] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: that is completley irrelevant
[15:14:42] <ajpiano> you still don't have to type out "jQuery" every time if you don't want to
[15:14:54] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: there also might be cases where you want your plugin to use a different copy of jQuery than the current window.jQuery
[15:15:05] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: ahhh, interesting.
[15:15:10] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: That would make sense.
[15:15:20] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: So you can mix and match versions of jQuery then?
[15:15:28] <ajpiano> if you are, for whatever reason, using multiple versions of jQuery on a page
[15:15:34] <ryanneufeld> ?jquery.noconflict()
[15:15:34] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[15:15:39] <ajpiano> "mix and match" isn't exactly what i'd call it
[15:15:46] <int> danzik17: I missed your post. But I'll read it now
[15:15:51] <eternalsword> TrentonDAdams: it's more for namespace that it's encapsulated the way it is.  and if you encapsulate it that way you get the benefit of the shorthand.
[15:16:18] <ryanneufeld> danzik17: can you repost that link? I'd like to understand that problem as well
[15:16:23] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: but if like, i'm a third party JS application, maybe i want to inject my own jQuery, then execute my app code inside of (function($) {})( jQuery.noConflict(true) );
[15:16:26] <danzik17> ryanneufeld: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[15:16:37] <TrentonDAdams> eternalsword: Not so concerned with shorthand, as I am concerned with other developers supporting it.  It might be confusing to be calling an anonymous function, for someone else.
[15:16:45] <ajpiano> which would revert the page's window.jQuery to whatever was there before
[15:16:45] <ajpiano> but my injected script will use the copy of jQuery i brought
[15:17:14] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: wrapping the plugin in an IIFE and aliasing jQuery is a common practise
[15:17:41] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Ahh, okay, that makes sense.  Is that mentioned in the documentation I wonder?  Cause it didn't seem obvious why they were using an anonymous function in that plugin authoring page
[15:17:52] <TrentonDAdams> Perhaps I just missed it. :P
[15:18:46] <jeffreylevesque> faryshta: http://pastebin.com/index/0fMTkExe
[15:18:46] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: the plugins authoring page probably could afford to link to IIFE instead of just referencing it
[15:18:49] <ajpiano> but it definitely talks about it
[15:19:13] <jeffreylevesque> Broote ^^ that has my html in there as well
[15:19:20] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Yeah, I saw that part.  It just doesn't really mention why, as well as you've explained.
[15:19:47] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: But, in reality, that should probably be a different page, with perhaps a link from the plugin authoring page.
[15:20:06] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Cause it might be best practise in general, for library uses.
[15:20:14] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: docs.jquery.com is pretty much going away soon
[15:20:23] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: How come?
[15:20:31] <ajpiano> cause mediawiki sucks
[15:20:39] <ajpiano> all the content will still be there, just in other places
[15:20:46] <nFFF> ajpiano, I dont get the noconflict method, what does it do that var $j = jQuery; doesnt?
[15:20:59] <ajpiano> nFFF: it removes the old references from window
[15:21:02] <faryshta> jeffreylevesque, I don't see any html there.
[15:21:14] <Broote> jeffreylevesque: i only see the javascript in that pastebin
[15:21:32] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Hmm, interesting.  So, jquery would need to be included prior to another library that might reference '$'?
[15:21:36] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: but duly noted that the general idea could be slightly improved to explain why the closure is necessary
[15:21:37] <eternalsword> int, looks like relevant part If POST is used to send data to the server, the Content-Type of the data sent to the server with the HTTP POST request is one of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain.
[15:22:02] <nFFF> is there anyway to easily search on github, triyng to search jquery src
[15:22:05] <nFFF> but not an expert
[15:22:10] <eternalsword> don't think application/json can be used xdomain
[15:22:17] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: yeah, it's probably most relevant to people like myself, who have *some* javascript experience, but not really much with namespaces, and using '$' and what not.
[15:22:20] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: no
[15:22:37] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: you can include jQuery after and give the $ "back " to the original thing that had it
[15:22:52] <danzik17> eternalsword: it can, but you have to handle the preflighted request properly, or use another workaround to avoid making a cross domain call altogether
[15:22:53] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, I see.  So jQuery library automatically stores a previous reference then?
[15:23:00] <ajpiano> yep
[15:23:05] <ajpiano> that's how noConflict works
[15:23:07] <Broote> jefferylevesque: if $(el).closest('.form-item').children('.option') actually selected more then one element you may have something like 'N/AN/A' (if there were two for example with the same text)
[15:23:09] <TrentonDAdams> ahh, that makes sense, cool.
[15:23:19] <nFFF> ajpiano, Im in the src code
[15:23:30] <nFFF> I cant see where it does anyhting apart form reutnr jQuery
[15:23:31] <nFFF> :|
[15:23:32] <TrentonDAdams> Well, thanks for all the help guys.  My eyes aren't so glazed over now. lol
[15:23:55] <danzik17> eternalsword: oh except for IE, because microsoft decided to be special - i think their XDomainRequest object only supports "text/plain" or something, can't remember - looked at this a while ago.
[15:24:07] <pawn> Is there a way to check if an element is currently animating?
[15:24:35] <ajpiano> nFFF: the parts where it reverts window.$ and window.jQuery to _$ and _jQuery
[15:25:20] <eternalsword> nFFF if you are searching src, you want to go to https://github.com/search, set Search for to Code, then in the search box put repo:jquery/jquery followed by your query
[15:25:27] <nFFF> I see those parts but dont understand exactly what it does
[15:25:33] <nFFF> and why theyre needed
[15:25:33] <faryshta> Is there an error here? http://pastebin.com/QVDch8ua
[15:25:51] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: It sounds like you are involved in the documentation, yes?  if so, it might be useful to mention that "restoring" of $ inside noConflict.  It's helpful for developers using the library to know that.  Or at least the inquisitive kind. :P  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[15:26:24] <TrentonDAdams> it mentions it, but it's not as clear as you explained here
[15:26:25] <Salvager> can i use php tags inside a js file?
[15:26:31] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues
[15:26:32] <eternalsword> pawn, http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[15:26:48] <BinaryKitten> Salvager only if you call it .php
[15:26:49] <faryshta> which is the proper way to use setInterval and jquery?
[15:26:57] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/jQuery.noConflict.xml ;)
[15:27:00] <Salvager> ohh ok
[15:27:00] <eternalsword> Salvager, yes, but you must use .js.php and then set the Content-Type
[15:27:14] <BinaryKitten> eternalsword good catch
[15:27:17] <nFFF> ajpiano, what does widnow.$ return, and what does setting it to _$ achieve, can you give me an example to understand whats happening up in hurr
[15:27:20] * BinaryKitten huggles ajpiano ltns
[15:27:37] <Salvager> .js.php? cant i just use .php?
[15:27:44] <ajpiano> nFFF: when jquery starts, it grabs whatever the hell it finds on window.$ and window.jQuery and stores them in a local variable called _$ and _jQuery
[15:28:01] <BinaryKitten> Salvager yes, but .js.php makes it nicer to know that it's outputting js via php
[15:28:06] <eternalsword> Salvager yes, you can just use .php, but it makes it easier to distinguish imo. it won't be cacheable though.
[15:28:08] <ajpiano> then when you call noConflict, it restores window.$ to _$
[15:28:08] <BinaryKitten> or should be
[15:28:14] <ajpiano> which could have been something else at the outset
[15:28:41] <Salvager> ok thanks alot
[15:28:45] <jeffreylevesque> Broote: http://jsfiddle.net/BGg5w/2/ sorry that's my code essentially
[15:29:50] <nFFF> ajpiano, ah thanks, knwoing that jquery does that on start makes it clearer
[15:29:52] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Done, thanks! https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/42
[15:29:52] <socialhapy>  Issue #42 on api.jquery.com (TrentonAdams; 4.756s ago): noConflict documentation update
[15:30:22] <ajpiano> nFFF: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L7
[15:30:24] <eternalsword> Salvager, you may want to include it with a timestamp <script src='somefile.js.php?time=<?php echo time(); ?>'> so that it always loads what you want instead of browser cache..
[15:30:26] <TrentonDAdams> oh, lol, I didn't even need to tell you. hehe
[15:30:58] <TrentonDAdams> socialhapy: How do I find you?
[15:31:03] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: thanks for pitching in
[15:31:06] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: socialhapy is a bot
[15:31:11] <TrentonDAdams> socialhapy: Or where can I download you?
[15:31:16] <ajpiano> um
[15:31:32] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: https://github.com/peol/socialhapy
[15:31:39] <Salvager> ohh, well im just gonna put it in my php file together with my html
[15:31:40] <TrentonDAdams> Very cool.  merci.
[15:31:43] <Salvager> but thanks
[15:31:44] <nFFF> ajpiano thanks, just getting used to github, I havent figured out hwo to grep a codebase yet, searching for things is hard
[15:31:46] <ajpiano> thank peol :)
[15:32:06] <Salvager> browser cache wont be an issue i think, its only for the admin backend
[15:33:00] <jeffreylevesque> what's wrong with this syntax: $(el).closest('.form-item').children('.option').val() == 'N/A' )?
[15:33:19] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, didnt we do this 30 mins ago :D
[15:33:25] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, check your markup
[15:33:28] <jeffreylevesque> no
[15:33:29] <nFFF> and your selectors
[15:33:30] <jeffreylevesque> i wish
[15:34:01] <nFFF> and log each selector to see where it fails
[15:34:23] <nFFF> console.log($(el), $(el).closest('.form-item').... etc
[15:34:29] <jeffreylevesque> heres' my log: http://jsfiddle.net/BGg5w/2/
[15:35:02] <nFFF> theres no log there dude
[15:35:05] <nFFF> ...
[15:35:58] <jeffreylevesque> forget logs
[15:36:38] <nFFF> ?
[15:37:00] <nFFF> put console.log($(el), $(el).closest('.form-item'), $(el).closest('.form-item').children('.option')); before your if statement
[15:37:04] <nFFF> and check your console...
[15:37:08] * nrd chelas time!
[15:39:37] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF: how do i check this console?
[15:40:02] <jeffreylevesque> the html is in the fiddle, the syntax should be correct
[15:41:03] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque what browser are you using
[15:41:04] <jeffreylevesque> el is the current item, we are going up one level in DOM, then finding a children element with the classname 'option'.  If the current one has value 'N/A', then hide all sibling radio button
[15:41:45] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque what browser are you using
[15:41:53] <jeffreylevesque> the sibling radio buttons are housed under '.form-wrapper' hence we are using closest()
[15:41:54] <jeffreylevesque> firefox
[15:41:55] <caniuse> jeffreylevesque: http://wil.to/_/firefox.gif
[15:42:39] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque you have firebug installed or a newer version of FF?
[15:42:55] <nFFF> either way press f12
[15:42:59] <nFFF> and click on console tab
[15:43:01] <jeffreylevesque> i do
[15:43:19] <jeffreylevesque> oh ya
[15:43:20] <nFFF> console.log(...) will log thigns to the console
[15:43:26] <nFFF> it helps you debug
[15:43:35] <sunbeam> i'd like to have the an <img> surrounded by a line/shadow
[15:43:43] <nFFF> if you dont know about it, you maybe shouldnt be writing code yet :)
[15:43:45] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best with jquery? or css
[15:43:57] <nFFF> sunbeam, #css
[15:44:35] <BinaryKitten> css3please.com
[15:44:56] <jeffreylevesque> ya maybe
[15:45:11] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF: but maybe you can help me write my custom modules in Drupal
[15:45:18] <nFFF> sure no problem
[15:45:42] <nFFF> just send me the list of thigns you need and ill do them right away, you go chill out
[15:45:43] <nFFF> :|
[15:45:52] <jeffreylevesque> ok
[15:46:12] * BinaryKitten wonders . o O ( is nFFF being sarcastic or not )
[15:46:33] <nFFF> :)
[15:46:48] * BinaryKitten wonders . o O ( if jeffreylevesque realises this )
[15:47:10] <jeffreylevesque> maybe either of them don't really care
[15:47:24] * BinaryKitten wonders . o O ( why she's wondering this stuff )
[15:49:26] <TrentonDAdams> What's the *proper* way of hiding an element that you want to use as a popup, such as a div?  Should I be calling $(sel).hide() on document ready, should I be doing a style of display : none, should I be, should I be, should I be. :D
[15:50:10] <BinaryKitten> TrentonDAdams  $(document.body).removeClass('no-js').addClass('js');
[15:50:34] <BinaryKitten> then, in your css .js #id  { display: none; }
[15:52:37] <TrentonDAdams> BinaryKitten: And the #id is for? Is that a reserved css for any element with an id?
[15:52:53] <BinaryKitten> any elem with id
[15:52:55] <TrentonDAdams> I know the syntax descendant selector.
[15:53:01] <TrentonDAdams> k.
[15:53:10] <BinaryKitten> or .js .class
[15:53:13] <TrentonDAdams> Don't think I've seen that before, but that is an elegant way of doing it.
[15:53:14] <BinaryKitten> or w/e in the css
[15:53:26] <BinaryKitten> oh and remember to add the class to the body
[15:53:34] <TrentonDAdams> Yes, of course
[15:53:35] <TrentonDAdams> :D
[15:53:37] <BinaryKitten> <body class="no-js"> :)
[15:54:00] <BinaryKitten> it's my default way now it's a lot easier to style for non-javascript stuff
[15:54:03] <TrentonDAdams> yep, for sure.  Are you accusing me of being stupid? muhahahah
[15:54:19] <TrentonDAdams> Of course it's always good to be safe.
[15:54:26] <BinaryKitten> TrentonDAdams if you wish to infer that, i'm not stupid enough to try and stop you
[15:54:28] <TrentonDAdams> You never know how advanced someone is in web development.
[15:54:39] <TrentonDAdams> BinaryKitten: haha, too funny.
[15:55:16] <TrentonDAdams> Or how advanced in page design someone is.  I'm a programmer, not a designer. :P  I get designers to do that stuff mostly
[15:56:44] <epantzar> BinaryKitten
[15:56:49] <epantzar> nthn
[15:57:12] <BinaryKitten> epantzar?
[15:58:58] <epantzar> ye was thinking of commenting on something you said, then I changed my mind.. but fingers didnt.. qqq
[16:08:20] <iliketurtles> how do I get jquery .next() function to return the contaning element of the selector match as well?  I'm only getting the <li>s inside the <ul> that the selector matches on
[16:14:10] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: here?
[16:21:05] <pawn> .map is a jquery method right, though jquery objects are just arrays, so does jquery overwrite the default Array.prototype.map method? How does jQuery's map differ from the standard?
[16:25:43] <tash> I'd like to loop through a table and find any <td>'s whose value is 'blah' where my table id is 'table' ... how can I do that?
[16:26:03] <MattDunbar> You mean the text inside the TD?
[16:26:12] <tash> yeah
[16:26:26] <MattDunbar> $('#tableID td').each(function() {
[16:26:39] <tash> MattDunbar: k, I was close
[16:26:41] <tash> let me try that
[16:26:55] <MattDunbar> if($(this).text() == 'blah') {
[16:27:24] <MattDunbar> err
[16:27:28] <MattDunbar> sorry, my syntax is way off
[16:27:41] <MattDunbar> $.each('#tableID td',function () {
[16:28:02] <MattDunbar> err
[16:28:03] <MattDunbar> nvm
[16:28:09] <MattDunbar> ignore me
[16:28:48] <tash> MattDunbar: thanks, that did it
[16:29:17] <MattDunbar> Does jQuery do anything that could emulate an imagemap?
[16:29:48] <MattDunbar> I want to have a map with canada and USA and the option to click on either (with the contour lines)
[16:41:05] <bakers> Is it possible to do a grouped "button" in JQuery or JQuery UI, like you can with mobile: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/forms/radiobuttons/events.html
[16:42:00] <BakaOu_NetBook> hi
[16:44:29] <TrentonDAdams> I'm confused by the differenc between this, $this, and $(this).
[16:44:42] <TrentonDAdams> Is there a difference?
[16:44:48] <ColKurtz> yes
[16:45:07] <TrentonDAdams> $(this), presumably would be a jquery object wrapping an element?
[16:45:13] <tw2113> this and $this are variables i assume
[16:45:17] <BakaOu_NetBook> does anyone know how a jquery user remove his trousers ?
[16:45:22] <tw2113> $(this) is selecting it
[16:45:33] <ColKurtz> $ calls jquery, this usually refers to a DOM element when used in a callback for a plugin
[16:46:00] <ColKurtz> somebody might do something llike $this = $(this) but I wouldn't know why.
[16:46:08] <BakaOu_NetBook>  $("trousers").hide()
[16:47:00] <ColKurtz> having a $ in front of a variable name commonly means that the variable returns a jquery collection, like $div = $("div"), or $menuItems = $("#nav li")
[16:47:09] <ColKurtz> But it's not an official standard
[16:50:35] <ryanneufeld> MattDunbar: you can build an image map in html as you normally would, and then use jQuery to manage the click events. Or you could use jquery to generate the map.  There is no "make an image map
[16:50:40] <ryanneufeld> " function though
[16:50:56] <MattDunbar> Well, I don't really want to use image map
[16:51:02] <pawn> How could I map the data-id attributes of a set of elements to an array?
[16:51:17] <MattDunbar> I was wondering if there was something similar.  I think I'm going to keep track of lines/curves and use math/js to do it
[16:51:21] <ryanneufeld> MattDunbar: the only other option would be svg/canvas, but I'm not help for you
[16:51:34] <ryanneufeld> MattDunbar: also an image map would be WAY faster than that
[16:51:37] <MattDunbar> ryanneufeld: Thanks.
[16:51:43] <juanojeda> hey guys
[16:51:53] <MattDunbar> ryanneufeld: would be hard to make it work with smooth contour lines around canada and US though
[16:51:53] <ryanneufeld> MattDunbar: there are tools for building them though, google around a bit.
[16:52:19] <ryanneufeld> MattDunbar: depends on how tight want it. You might be entering the realm of canvas
[16:52:20] <juanojeda> i'm having a bit of trouble with a plugin i'm writing, specifically getting multiple instances to function individually
[17:01:43] <juanojeda> i'm having a bit of trouble with a plugin i'm writing, specifically getting multiple instances to function individually - here's a jsbin of it with simplified markup http://jsbin.com/osocuv/2/edit
[17:02:24] <juanojeda> the plugin itself works fine on single instances, but when i use it on multiple elements on the same page, it seems that both instances are affected rather than isolated
[17:02:34] <xboi209> if i had <div id="foo">Hello, my name is xboi209</div>     how would i replace only xboi209 but not the rest?

[17:16:47] <v_y> is it possible to find elements by their styling? i'm trying to find all elements with "pointer-events: none", for example
[17:19:06] <v_y> or is there a way to crawl the entire document..?
[17:25:41] <ColKurtz> Is there a way to execute a plugin's internal functions from the console?
[17:28:12] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I am looking for suggestions on your favorite jquery graph plugin...
[17:30:57] <ColKurtz> LindsayMac, have you seen the Google graph API?
[17:31:14] <greenhat> In FF 13 on linux I'm seeing the $.get() method pass undefined as the data argument the the callback function, but I can see in firebug that data is being returned.
[17:31:18] <LindsayMac> I have not, but I will look!
[17:31:49] <LindsayMac> ColKurtz:  right now I don't have a specific data set I am using in mind, I'm just mocking up
[17:31:57] <ColKurtz> I see
[17:32:32] <LindsayMac> google charts looks pretty awesome though!
[17:33:20] <ColKurtz> Yeah it is
[17:33:56] <LindsayMac> So another random question.. i am looking at bootstrap - and I havent had a chance to test a lot, but how "degradable" is their tabs / forms
[17:34:40] <LindsayMac> i'm using the data-toggle function for now...
[17:34:51] <ColKurtz> What are you concerned about LindsayMac ?
[17:35:27] <LindsayMac> I am making an admin dashboard.. I am really pretty new with javascript in general, but not other aspects of web dev. I want to make sure that the tabs I create in the admin screen work
[17:35:28] <LindsayMac> hah
[17:35:48] <LindsayMac> i know thats SUPER general.. but the tabs that use the data-toggle... doesn't that only work in current browsers?
[17:45:26] <LindsayMac> everyone disappeared
[17:48:25] <x86> I'm currently using some generic ajaxpage.js for doing simple dynamic content updates within my website, but I'm wanting to upgrade to jQuery... starting with just AJAX content, but later other things
[17:49:20] <x86> so, I'm looking for a good starting point (example) for doing simple AJAX dynamic content with jQuery
[17:49:27] <x86> anyone have some suggestions?
[17:57:38] <ColKurtz> sorry LindsayMac my client crashed
[17:57:39] <ColKurtz> >.<
[17:57:43] <ColKurtz> did ya still need some help?
[17:57:57] <LindsayMac> its ok! it seems like you werent the only!
[17:58:02] <LindsayMac> there was a mass exodus! hah
[17:58:08] <ColKurtz> netsplit?
[17:58:17] <ColKurtz> x86, lucky for you, jQuery greatly simplifies AJAX requests :D
[17:58:40] <LindsayMac> I was just wondering if, built in to bootstrap, there was a way for the tabs to gracefully degrade
[17:58:45] <ColKurtz> if you've previously done AJAX requests from scratch then $.ajax will be easy
[17:59:11] <ColKurtz> LindsayMac, I would trust that bootstrap's elements are well-written and degrade gracefully
[17:59:19] <ColKurtz> there's a boostrap IRC channel iirc
[17:59:38] <LindsayMac> ColKurtz:  i went there.. there was 3 people.
[17:59:44] <LindsayMac> unless its not a freenode one
[17:59:48] <ColKurtz> LindsayMac, #twitter-bootstrap
[17:59:55] <LindsayMac> OHHHHHh that explains
[17:59:56] <LindsayMac> thanks!
[17:59:59] <ColKurtz> 88 people :)
[18:00:08] <LindsayMac> on it! 100%
[18:00:13] <LindsayMac> had the wrong chan name
[18:00:32] <LindsayMac> Thanks so much!
[18:19:39] <alphaai> Hello
[18:20:01] <alphaai> I am trying to call a server from $.ajax
[18:20:19] <alphaai> I mean i am trying to load a php page
[18:20:28] <alphaai> and its not working
[18:20:45] <alphaai> I am using phonegap
[18:23:26] <alphaai> anyone here?
[18:28:28] <x86> ok so I found a great tutorial on doing AJAX dynamic content with jQuery, and got my site working with it... my back-end code is returning JSON-encoded data, and it's populating the appropriate <div> as I want...
[18:28:57] <x86> however, it's using the .text method, and there is html within my JSON data... is there a .html method?
[18:30:09] <x86> oh nice, there totally is... bitchin
[18:30:53] <pawn> what happens when you re-order the arguments for .animate:  .animate({properties}, function.., 1000)
[18:30:54] <pawn> ?
[18:31:43] <Whirl3d> depends on which notation you are using.
[18:32:12] <pawn> Whirl3d: What do you mean?
[18:32:32] <Whirl3d> my preferred notation is $("elem").animate(props, actions);   where props is your props and actions contains the callbacks, duration, easing
[18:33:15] <Whirl3d> $("element").animate({opacity:0},{duration:3000, easing:"easeOutback", step:stepFunc, queue:false, complete:callb});
[18:33:40] <Whirl3d> this gives you access to the queue animation property as well as the step and complete callbacks.
[18:33:54] <pawn> I see
[18:34:20] <Whirl3d> whereas $("elem").animate({opacity:0}, 300, "easeOutback", callb) doesn't give you access to queue or step and requires that they be in the right order
[18:45:44] <alphaai> hello there, anyone has any experience using jsonp
[18:46:13] <bencahill> Hey guys, do you have methods for profiling code or figuring out how to make it faster?
[18:46:58] <bencahill> (methods = ways of doing things) ;)
[18:48:58] <Whirl3d> ?ftjq
[18:48:58] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[18:49:20] <Whirl3d> prolly not what you were looking for, but still a good read
[18:49:20] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Does that cover making things faster?
[18:49:24] <bencahill> Ah.
[18:49:38] <Whirl3d> do you have a specific issue?
[18:49:45] <Whirl3d> because jquery is pretty fast
[18:50:50] <bencahill> I'm building a photo management app, using Selectable and Galleriffic (plugin), and when I get lots of photos on a page, it slows down to .3-.5sec when going through photos. This is not insignificant, and I'd like to make it as fast as possible.
[18:51:41] <Whirl3d> that's a problem with Galleriffic. You need to use lazy loading and I couldn't figure out good way to do it with Galleriffic..
[18:51:43] <bencahill> I was on 1.4.3, but upgraded to 1.7.2, and actually noticed a speed increase, and nothing messed up. Nice!
[18:52:02] <bencahill> Whirl3d: No, this has nothing to do with that. I'm talking CPU time.
[18:52:35] <Whirl3d> Okay, before you say: "it has nothing to do with that" perhaps you should consider a couple of things
[18:52:41] <jonkersjoe> hi, if I use a selection of $("input, select").each(function(){} how would i check in the each function whether the element is a input or select ?
[18:52:54] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Pics are local, and on the order of 50K (by local, I mean on the same machine.)
[18:53:07] <bencahill> Whirl3d: I'm talking about pics that are already loaded into the DOM
[18:53:12] <bencahill> (or browser cache, rather)
[18:53:21] * bencahill headsmack
[18:53:31] <jonkersjoe> nevermind, just realised that I should really use two selections
[18:53:37] <Whirl3d> The way that events are handled in 1.7 are much more effecient that 1.4. If your plugin is using the 1.4 methods rather than taking advabtage of the new methods (which it has to if it ran on 1.4), then there's your problem
[18:54:34] <bencahill> Ooh, that sounds interesting...yes, it did run on 1.4
[18:54:55] <Whirl3d> then it has no way of knowing about the new method handling models, now does it?
[18:55:01] <bencahill> Right, right.
[18:55:15] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Anything specific that I could look into?
[18:55:15] <Whirl3d> So you can either scrap it, or you can figure out how to update it.
[18:55:42] <Whirl3d> the use of Delegation for evernts is a big one
[18:56:44] <Whirl3d> rather than having to bind a bunch of events to events to every image (thus making your app grow exponentially when you add more images), you can handle the events through delegation one time and it handles any nunber of image
[18:57:27] <Whirl3d> it also handles images that you load after the gallery has been built or before...
[18:57:46] <bencahill> It's interesting, because a couple of days ago I was trying to figure out where the slowdown was, so I put a bunch of console.log('identifier'+Date.now()) statements in different places, and saw a big jump between two, but I couldn't figure out what was actually happening during that period (the code after the break was a callback...oh wait...I'll have to look at that again)
[18:58:43] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Do you think that would affect Galleriffic when using the arrow keys?
[18:59:00] <Whirl3d> Use of Deferred objects can make for much more robust and faster callbacks
[18:59:49] <Whirl3d> I am not sure how gallerific binds the key events, but if it binds a key handler to every image element, yes
[19:00:03] <bencahill> Mmkay, I'll def. take a look at that.
[19:00:46] <Whirl3d> What features of Galleriffic did you like that made you decide to use it over any of the others?
[19:01:08] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Speed, thumbnails, keyboard nav.
[19:01:23] <bencahill> Whirl3d: I'd be willing to try some others if they might be faster.
[19:02:37] <Whirl3d> I ended up writing my own and I couldn't be more pleased with it, really. It's not for public consumption cause it has my own special use  pieces manually macked out rather than a general allpupose plugin
[19:03:22] <Whirl3d> but it was a great learning experience and I plan to bring it online this week.
[19:04:12] <Whirl3d> I'm not sure what your skill level is or what your timeframe is, but I would heartily say to anyone that it is well worth the hassle to build one yourself if you have the time...
[19:04:54] <bencahill> Yeah, timeframe is quite small...I want to have it usable for a trip this weekend (leaving Saturday)...I'll probably be culling through 5-10k photos through the week.
[19:05:56] <Whirl3d> so you are really using it to sort through a bunch of pics?
[19:06:06] <bencahill> I haven't yet, but will be.
[19:06:35] <Whirl3d> That's why you want to use selectable with it....
[19:06:35] <bencahill> I want to move away from Picasa...it's nice and decently fast, but it's just so annoying to work with unless you just have one computer.
[19:06:57] <Whirl3d> I loathe picasa's interface..
[19:07:01] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yup. ;) Although most of the work will be done in preview (large) mode with Galleriffic.
[19:07:06] <bencahill> Whirl3d: What specifically?
[19:07:41] <Whirl3d> You don't want to get me started: but one thing I absolutely hate is the scrollbar'
[19:07:46] <Whirl3d> it's a sham
[19:08:03] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Ah, yeah, it's kinda pointless. I just use the scrollwheel...but yeah, that's pretty legitimate.
[19:08:23] <bencahill> I can't actually remember ever using it...except maybe once or twice at the beginning.
[19:08:34] <Whirl3d> and the way it makes up it's mind how it's gonna organize my crap...gimme a break;
[19:08:56] <Whirl3d> I liked Adobe's solution Adobe Album...it was the greatest by far
[19:09:04] <Whirl3d> but it crashed with too many images
[19:09:05] <bencahill> In what way? I just have a bunch of date-based folders, and it doesn't do anything ridiculous.
[19:09:31] <Whirl3d> I don't have my shit organized by date....though picasa likes to think that I do
[19:09:33] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yeah, I tried literally over a dozen, and read about more, photo managers a few weeks ago before deciding to build my own. :P
[19:09:41] <bencahill> Oh heh.
[19:10:38] <bencahill> Bibble was decent (Win/linux), but pretty slow, and money...
[19:11:07] <bencahill> And really, speed is a big factor for me, because I don't carry around i7 laptops like everyone else must.
[19:11:12] <Whirl3d> I have friends who love Bridge....but I hate hate hate it.
[19:11:34] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Some options like that were just out because I use linux. ;)
[19:11:41] <bencahill> Whirl3d: What do you use now?
[19:12:33] <Whirl3d> Unfortunately, I got stuck in the windows rut.
[19:12:43] <bencahill> Hehe.
[19:12:47] <Whirl3d> I'll be getting a Mac in the next week or so
[19:13:06] <Whirl3d> And I've played with Ubuntu and HPux Solaris
[19:13:34] <bencahill> Interesting...I thinks Macs are intriguing as far as UNIX base + nice desktop experience...although I've never really used one.
[19:13:38] <Whirl3d> and Lindoze....lol
[19:13:59] <Whirl3d> that might be a good solution for you actually
[19:14:19] <Whirl3d> Aperature on the mac is supposed to be worth buying a mac for by itself.
[19:14:29] <bencahill> As far as OSes though, I just advocate what works most efficiently for you. For me right now, that's linux. If I did video editing, I really doubt that it would be. ;)
[19:14:52] <Whirl3d> What do you do for income?
[19:15:22] <bencahill> Whirl3d: 18, parents. ;)
[19:15:29] <Whirl3d> oh wow.
[19:15:51] <Whirl3d> I am so old, I think I'm gonna go cry in the corner for a while...
[19:16:30] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Are you a photographer as well?
[19:16:39] * bencahill hopes to lift Whirl3d's spirits.
[19:17:01] <Whirl3d> lol. You wanna see pictures of when the earth was just cooling...I got em.
[19:17:02] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:17:06] <bencahill> lol
[19:17:09] <bwq> :D
[19:17:33] * bencahill catches a glimpse of a smirk from a far-away creature.
[19:17:50] <Whirl3d> bencahill, you have great command of language. You should write...
[19:18:08] <Whirl3d> What do you plan to do when you grow up?
[19:18:14] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Thank you! I try to be excellent at everything I do. ;-)
[19:18:22] <bencahill> s/try/strive/ ;-)
[19:18:54] <bencahill> I'll probably be a sys-admin like my brother, or venture into some other computer-related field.
[19:19:29] <Whirl3d> Stay out of IT if you can. Do something creative.
[19:19:44] <Whirl3d> IT will drain the life out of you. It's a terrible and thankless job
[19:19:50] <bencahill> :(
[19:19:59] <bencahill> I'm not surprised...
[19:20:33] <bencahill> What I really love is photography...just not the culling part. :P
[19:21:39] <Whirl3d> i got started when Desktop publishing was first introduced. I published an 80 page full-color glossy magazine called Earth Observation back in 1988. It was one of the first fully digitally produced magazines ever.
[19:21:52] <bencahill> Wow. Cool!
[19:22:51] <Whirl3d> And I had a lot of success doing some great work back then. But slowly, I got lured into IT work until one day, the creative stuff was "extra" and the IT was work
[19:23:07] <jeffreylevesque> can someone me why my radio buttons is not clearing: http://jsfiddle.net/BGg5w/6/
[19:23:43] <Whirl3d> don't let go of your creative side and do what you love---money will follow. (I'll get off my soapbox now).
[19:23:54] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, looking at it now
[19:24:14] <bencahill> Whirl3d: No, you make good points. Thanks for the discussion. :)
[19:25:13] <Whirl3d> 8)
[19:25:30] <Whirl3d> so jeffreylevesque, you want it to be unselected when the NA button is clicked?
[19:26:07] <jeffreylevesque> if a radio button has a value 'N/A", i need it along with it's immediate siblings to be hidden
[19:26:37] <jeffreylevesque> that's what I'm hoping will happen with this: $(el).closest('.form-wrapper').hide();
[19:28:31] <Whirl3d> can you assign a class to all the n/a options?
[19:29:06] <Whirl3d> so they would read class='form-radio na'    for example...
[19:29:18] <jeffreylevesque> Whirl3d, I can't really touch the HTML
[19:29:29] <jeffreylevesque> that's generated by my CMS - Drupal
[19:29:40] <Whirl3d> but you can after words...gimme a second and I'll show you what I mean,.
[19:29:59] <coldhead> afterwards*
[19:30:04] <jeffreylevesque> well I could I suppose add a preprocessing function
[19:30:31] <jeffreylevesque> but I feel like it could be done all in the jquery (custom module I'm writing)
[19:32:38] <Whirl3d> wow. afterwards, my grammar has just gone to hell since I have started using IRC.
[19:33:12] <coldhead> it's cool man, i got your back
[19:33:41] * coldhead drops the 10 volume OED on Whirl3d;s back
[19:33:59] <adambarnett> hi, i was wondering if i could ask a dumb question
[19:34:18] <bencahill> Error: cannot parse sentence part 's back'.
[19:34:19] <adambarnett> almost a total novice
[19:34:29] <bencahill> @ask
[19:34:33] <bencahill> :(
[19:34:35] <coldhead> ask already, adambarnett!
[19:34:40] * bencahill is not familiar with the bot(s) here.
[19:34:40] <adambarnett> okay
[19:34:45] <adambarnett> dw cs6
[19:34:49] <coldhead> prefix with ?, bencahill
[19:34:57] <bencahill> coldhead: thx
[19:35:09] <jeffreylevesque> i'm almost a novice newb
[19:35:20] <adambarnett> followed the lynda.com tut on doing jequry  photo gallery
[19:35:30] <adambarnett> completed
[19:35:31] <adambarnett> done
[19:35:34] <adambarnett> working just fine
[19:35:43] <adambarnett> next project was to learn some php
[19:35:44] <adambarnett> so
[19:35:49] <adambarnett>  next lynda tut on that
[19:35:59] <adambarnett> converted pages to php
[19:36:07] <bencahill> Learn jQuery/JS, check! Learn PHP, check!
[19:36:24] <adambarnett> everything works fine now except
[19:36:28] <adambarnett> the gallery
[19:36:47] <adambarnett> and, nothing on the pages with the gallery has changed
[19:37:01] <adambarnett> i even tried renaming the files back to html
[19:37:09] <adambarnett> so that REALLY nothing had changed
[19:37:11] <adambarnett> but
[19:37:12] <adambarnett> still
[19:37:19] <adambarnett> so
[19:37:26] <adambarnett> i'm flumoxed
[19:37:44] <adambarnett> ANY ideas?
[19:37:48] * bencahill thinks two m's
[19:37:53] <adambarnett> thinks so too
[19:38:07] <bencahill> ;)
[19:38:18] <adambarnett> :)
[19:38:30] <bencahill> adambarnett: By the way, you can do that like this, if you didn't know: /me thinks bla...
[19:39:04] <adambarnett> well, since i'm here with hat in hand i put tape over the sarcasm button
[19:40:31] <coldhead> we'll need to see your code, adambarnett
[19:40:39] <coldhead> or better still a working (broken) demo
[19:41:18] <adambarnett> working demo at  nostalgialab.info
[19:42:10] <adambarnett> but you know, that's not the one giving me the troubles
[19:42:48] <adambarnett> so to see the broken one, should i upload it to the server? or you want some text files or what? don't know how y'all do things here
[19:43:10] <adambarnett> guidance much appreciated
[19:44:28] <coldhead> on the server is best
[19:44:37] <coldhead> if you can just give us a URL that exactly reproduces your problem
[19:45:19] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, is it because you have _none on  two of the 3 NA buttons?
[19:48:20] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BGg5w/21/
[19:50:03] <adambarnett> coldhead, uploading no, thx
[19:50:08] <adambarnett> now*
[19:54:18] <bencahill> The other thing I have to try to figure out is adding keybindings, click-shift-click selection, and jumping (code) to a particular item in Selectable...The old (dev?) version of Selectable I was using had all of this, but was VERY slow (as in 30sec slow) with a lot (~1000) of images.
[19:54:25] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BGg5w/25/   nice and simple...
[19:55:58] <Whirl3d> so benchahill, you are passing a list of urls to the gallery script that you get from php or something?
[19:57:14] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yeah. The image records are stored in an SQLite db (along with other info like ratings) and pulled up via PHP into two lists on the page, one for Selectable, and one for Galleriffic.
[19:57:46] <bencahill> Whirl3d: If you're curious: https://github.com/bencahill/lightize
[19:58:15] <bencahill> Much of the code has been changed significantly in the past few days due to adding Galleriffic, but the base is there.
[19:58:43] <bencahill> Also, I do very little programming, so most of it is probably crap. :P It works for me. ;)
[19:59:48] <coldhead> that's the main thing!
[20:00:22] <bencahill> Well, unless you want to change it later, which is generally always. I did the best I could, I just don't know much in that arena. ;-)
[20:05:25] <adambarnett> cold head, so i uploaded to the server and it works there, but not on my local server
[20:05:42] <adambarnett> ~shrug~
[20:05:50] <adambarnett> worked fine as html
[20:05:57] <adambarnett> dunno
[20:06:13] <coldhead> running things locally can be problematic
[20:06:21] <coldhead> with relative vs. absolute URLs
[20:06:31] <coldhead> also throw PHP into the mix and it might be PHP fucking up
[20:06:49] <coldhead> but so just run it on the server and enjoy! :D
[20:06:51] <adambarnett> so this is normal then?
[20:06:54] <adambarnett> :D
[20:07:03] <adambarnett> or "common"
[20:10:04] <coldhead> adambarnett: having bugs in development disappear in production (or vice versa) is sadly common
[20:10:11] <coldhead> networks and servers are gomblicated
[20:10:20] <adambarnett> this is good to know :)
[20:10:34] <coldhead> you just have to be patient
[20:10:55] <coldhead> its good to be able to let bugs go, when necessary
[20:10:57] <adambarnett> thanks for the responses ;) I'm sure i'll be back :)
[20:11:09] <coldhead> if you just say "wtf, now it works, oh well, lets get on with it" you can save yourself a lot of wasted time
[20:11:16] <adambarnett> roger that
[20:11:21] <adambarnett> i can do that
[20:11:24] <adambarnett> i excel at that
[20:11:30] <adambarnett> filed under "fuck it"
[20:11:30] <adambarnett> ]
[20:31:25] <jonkersjoe> hi how do you check if a textarea is populated ? $("textarea").textLength doesn't seem to work.
[20:32:31] <Whirl3d> you were close....try $("textarea").val().length or possibly $("textarea").text().length....
[20:32:57] <jonkersjoe> ahh right.
[20:32:59] <Whirl3d> not sure which is right, so try em both.
[20:33:08] <shoky> hi
[20:33:24] <Whirl3d> shoky! Where ya been ma friend?
[20:33:44] <shoky> out, and then asleep ;p
[20:33:56] <shoky> pm'd you, btw
[20:34:12] <jonkersjoe> I've used the following with success : $("textarea").each(function(){ console.log(this.textLength);});
[20:34:15] <Whirl3d> I have my speakers off. srry. looking now
[20:35:27] <shoky> jonkersjoe: this.innerText.length  or $(this).val().length
[20:35:43] <jonkersjoe> ok thanks
[20:35:52] <shoky> er sorry this.innerText wont work
[20:37:56] <jonkersjoe> val().length works
[20:38:24] <shoky> ah .value.length should also be good
[20:38:36] <shoky> this.value.length, that is
[20:42:40] <krz> how do i add a class "last" to every odd li element?
[20:44:15] <eip56> is there any way to set a specific set like say a div.stuff using $.ajax and not load. I know you can specify params with load but what param would I set in the $.ajax to achieve the same effect
[20:44:21] <shoky> krz: $('li').each(function(i,el) { if (i%2==1) $(el).addClass('last') })
[20:44:33] <krz> isn't there a better way?
[20:45:01] <shoky> better how?
[20:45:58] <shoky> eip56: you can do anything with $.ajax that you can with .load
[20:46:34] <eip56> Yea i know axaj is the root  but where would i define the div i want back instead of returning the whole request page
[20:47:38] <shoky> eip56:  you would run a jquery selector on the returned data
[20:47:46] <shoky> and extract only what you want
[20:47:52] <shoky> which is what .load does, i believe
[20:48:25] <eip56> ah ok i had guessed that and were looking at the man pages but didnt see any param specifically for that but since it was included in load had wondered if i was missing it
[20:48:36] <eip56> thanks shoky you are always super helpful
[20:49:12] <shoky> np
[20:50:50] <eip56> Any good jquery procided selectors or am i looking at doing something along the lines of data.find(div.stuff)
[20:53:14] <shoky> .load makes a new div and appends the responseText to it, then runs a .find() on that div with your selector
[20:54:16] <shoky> eip56 best to look at the source, it's mostly simple:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L204
[20:58:01] <jeffreylevesque> I'm trying to clear radio buttons if it's default value = 'N/A'.. but my jquery is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/BGg5w/12/
[20:59:15] <Whirl3d> jeffreylevesque, did you look at the link I sent you?
[20:59:46] <jeffreylevesque> sorry stepped out to dunkin donuts
[20:59:50] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[20:59:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BGg5w/25/
[21:00:06] <jeffreylevesque> looks like your fiddle is correct :)
[21:00:27] <Whirl3d> if you select NA, it hides the options. But if you wan them back, click on the label
[21:00:38] <Whirl3d> actually clicking on the label toggles them
[21:01:04] <shoky> umm
[21:01:12] <shoky> you just had <label>N/A </label>
[21:01:31] <shoky> != 'N/A'
[21:01:35] <Whirl3d> He can't change the html he said
[21:01:38] <shoky> o
[21:01:48] <shoky> then change the js..
[21:01:50] <shoky> 'N/A ' :P
[21:02:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BGg5w/25/
[21:02:29] <Whirl3d> I think he wanted something like that
[21:02:47] <Eviltwin> I just had a terrible, terrible idea: http://pastebin.com/YP0EtkDd
[21:02:47] <krz> whats wrong with this: html += '<li class="social_updates clearfix" data-provider="'+value.provider+'" data-profile="'+(value.profile == true) ? 'true' : 'false'+'">\n';
[21:03:28] <krz> i suspect eh problem is with the way data-profile is being assigned
[21:04:58] <shoky> krz add parens around that expression.. ((value.profile == true) ? 'true' : 'false')
[21:05:07] <shoky> of course, you don't really need any of that there
[21:05:14] <shoky> if it's a boolean
[21:05:22] <shoky> ?js true.toString()
[21:05:24] <bot-t> shoky: "true"
[21:05:38] <Eviltwin> Much less value.profile == true
[21:05:47] <shoky> heh
[21:06:45] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, what was that terrible terrible idea and why was it terrible?
[21:07:17] <jeffreylevesque> Whirl3d: is it necessary to specify the click() for each 'N/A' radio button, or can that be generic?
[21:07:19] <eip56> shoky sorry to bother. I understand 96% of the source but i don't understand where they are getting the response text.. and if the data var holds the return shouldnt i just be able to query it with .find()
[21:07:32] <jeffreylevesque> for instance: $('#edit-field-classified-for-sale-und-9').click();
[21:07:36] <eip56> I guess my question is what is the need for the dummy div
[21:07:46] <Whirl3d> try it and see
[21:07:48] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It lets you compare the sizes of jQuery collections using >, <, and ==
[21:07:50] <shoky> Eviltwin that's pretty sweet. scary tho :P
[21:08:24] <Eviltwin> And it's terrible because I'm copying the whole collection and all its methods on to a Number object to accomplish it
[21:08:40] <shoky> eip56: .find only looks at descendants of the root element
[21:08:45] <Eviltwin> And because it's not really a number if($("#foo")) { ... } tests are still always true
[21:08:52] <shoky> eip56: the div is there just to act as root element
[21:09:02] <Eviltwin> However if(+$("#foo")) { ... } tests work properly
[21:10:10] <xboi209> is there a way where i can detect what page is loaded so i can load certain scripts?
[21:10:26] <Eviltwin> xboi209: See window.location
[21:11:13] <krz> shoky: like so: $('li:odd').addClass('last');
[21:11:54] <xboi209> so if i go like              if(window.location == http://www.google.com){alert("Dude you on google");}       would that work?
[21:12:38] <Eviltwin> Once you add quotes
[21:12:44] <coldhead> and a trailing slash
[21:12:52] <coldhead> better to do it with regular expression matching
[21:12:55] <Eviltwin> But there are also properties inside it
[21:13:00] <Eviltwin> Like pathname
[21:13:02] <coldhead> or substrs
[21:13:10] <xboi209> quotes to the link?
[21:13:15] <Eviltwin> xboi209: Learn more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location

[21:14:10] <shoky> krz: ok
[21:18:08] <wavez> I recent did this tutorial to start using ajax (using jquery) http://www.sitepoint.com/ajax-jquery/
[21:18:20] <wavez> and I have a question about the callback function.
[21:18:45] <wavez> I want to know how to make it work using a predefined function, rather than an anonymous function.
[21:21:49] <wavez> I get an error when using $.post() when I try to pass the xml to my function. I don't get this error when using an inline function. I'll put examples on pastebin.
[21:22:24] <LV> wavez: do you understand the difference between a FUNCTION and a FUNCTION REFERENCE?
[21:22:36] <wavez> yes
[21:22:41] <mfoxdogg|work> hi wavez , hi all
[21:22:53] <wavez> holy crap! mfoxdogg|work !!
[21:23:11] <mfoxdogg|work> wavez: thought it was you but wasn't sure :)
[21:23:20] <wavez> good way to test it!
[21:23:21] <LV> wavez: and you're having issues that your callbacks don't like your function refs?  next question is, then, does your function match the calling signature listed in the API?
[21:24:04] <jonkersjoe> Hi I'm trying to pass in an object to a couple of functions, and I've assumed that when you pass in an object it is passed in by reference to the object. However, in one of the functions I'm trying to clear the attributes of the object to re-assign new attributes. I'm doing it by obj.Items = {};, however, once I do this I think I'm loosing the link to the attributes. How would I be able to clear all the attributes without loosing the lin
[21:25:36] <wavez> my code: http://pastebin.com/vdZTYVeK
[21:26:06] <wavez> LV, I don't understand this question: "does your function match the calling signature listed in the API?"
[21:27:48] <LV> meaning, function (xml){} when the API wants to have (xml) parameter.  that looks ok. but your error is where you say: new PutItInYourBox(xml)
[21:27:58] <LV> replace that with: PutItInYourBox
[21:28:07] <LV> then your callback should work.  at least that will be correct syntax, anyway
[21:29:08] <Whirl3d> jonkersjoe, I have read you question 3 time and I am still not clear what you are asking. Can you make a fsfiddle and post the link here so I can have some idea about what you are asking..?
[21:29:09] <LV> also, in your "this works" ... you shouldn't *name* an ANONYMOUS function reference. :)
[21:29:33] <LV> that's why the syntax is: function (xml) { // code here }
[21:29:50] <jonkersjoe> Hey Whirl3d: I did do a testcase on jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/rB6c6/
[21:30:00] <Whirl3d> that rox
[21:31:14] <wavez> LV, ya, I was doing it without the name on the anonymous function before, but I was trying to change it back really fast and I pasted it that way in my editor and hit run. It worked, so I dropped it into paste bin. Use "new" was an experiment. I don't think it works when I take that out either. I'll try it now.
[21:31:34] <LV> wavez: I want to be absolutely clear: line 10 in your paste should read (ignoring whitespace): putItInYourBox
[21:31:46] <LV> wavez: and nothing else. :)
[21:31:47] <wavez> LV, "reference error: xml is not defined"
[21:31:56] <wavez> oh
[21:32:04] <wavez> no (xml) ?
[21:32:08] <wavez> why? How will that work?
[21:32:30] <wavez> holy crap, that works. WTF
[21:32:38] <LV> because the IDENTIFIER "putItInYourBox" returns the function REFERENCE (correct).  when you include parentheses, you are CALLING the function....
[21:32:50] <LV> and returning whatever that execution returns...
[21:32:55] <wavez> ooohhh
[21:33:04] <wavez> weird
[21:33:04] <LV> that's why I asked that, first thing. :)
[21:33:14] <wavez> okay. Understood. Thank you :)
[21:33:18] <LV> welcome!
[21:36:18] <LV> wavez: so a function is a peice of code that lives in memory.  when you want to EXECUTE that peice of code, you call it: myFunc(params); when you want to call it later, you refer to the memory (REFERENCE) and then later on jquery does: function nextThing(callback) {  callback() };  and if you passed "myFunc": nextThing(myFunc);  then it executes myFunc() when inside nextThing... by CALLING the reference.
[21:36:56] <krz> how do i match the li element that has data-profile = true and data-provider = twitter. for example: <li data-profile="true" data-provider="twitter" class="social_updates clearfix">
[21:39:23] <wavez> LV, I'm trying to understand the example you are giving me, but I can't get it. This is the code that works. What I don't understand though, is how putItInYourBox is able to receive the xml variable when I've done nothing to tell .post() to pass xml to putItInYourBox().
[21:39:28] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/vMvf2VWC
[21:39:48] <jonkersjoe> whirl3d: any ideas?
[21:40:12] <wavez> LV, I assume that xml is not global, but this code makes it look as though it is.
[21:40:14] <krz> anyone?
[21:40:41] <Whirl3d> I honestly think you are just trying to confuse yourself for the fun of it.  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rB6c6/3/
[21:40:47] <wavez> krz, I think you use the attribute equals selector
[21:41:36] <Whirl3d> I still have no clue what you expect to get out of that, but I wrote comments for as much of it as I could stand...Now I am taking a break before my head pops
[21:41:43] <LV> wavez: because, you defined the functino like that: function pIIYB(xml) { //code };  when that piece of code is run, it expects a parameter, and in the local scope, it's called 'xml' .  I think javascript will just quietly pass null if there is no parameter... but the code INSIDE the function at least has a valid identifier.
[21:41:56] <jeffreylevesque> Whirl3d: you are a machine
[21:41:58] <wavez> krz jQuery('[attribute="value"]')
[21:42:50] <wavez> LV, but couldn't .post() have any number of paramters it MIGHT pass to the function?
[21:43:16] <jonkersjoe> krz: http://jsfiddle.net/nRrPY/
[21:43:27] <LV> wavez: THAT is why I asked, if your function definition matched the API... the docs show what parameters the callback for .post() is expecting
[21:43:53] <jonkersjoe> Whirl3d: ok thanks I'll check that out
[21:44:16] <LV> wavez: so the answer is, if the docs say post() uses, oh, (xml,index,callback,happyflag) then that's just how you write your function.
[21:44:38] <wavez> LV, I see
[21:45:03] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know what's wrong with this syntax: && $(el).closest('.form-item').children('.option').text() == 'N/A'  ?
[21:45:56] <wavez> LV, thanks again for the help, and the explanation.
[21:46:02] <wavez> time for food. bbl
[21:46:05] <jeffreylevesque> this is the full fiddler of fiddles - http://jsfiddle.net/BGg5w/28/
[21:46:18] <LV> wavez: in fact, from the docs: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {}    since you only care about 'data', your callback only sets up 'xml' (first slot) and "just works"
[21:46:44] <LV> wavez: if you needed the other things, your callback would include those parameters in the function declaration
[21:48:02] <LV> wavez: (and, you're welcome! :-)
[21:48:20] <wavez> okay. super. I'll check the doc for the function for future situations like this
[21:49:00] <LV> wavez: totally.  the initial tricky part of working with ANY library in ANY language is, "How do I call this thing?" (which is what the API listing explains)
[21:49:23] <LV> wavez: after you're calling it correctly, THEN you can decide if the data you're passing or getting back makes sense for you. :)
[21:53:03] <pandu101> hey guys, just need some help on checking a textfield to see if the dot character has been entered by user. Is it possible to do this in jquery? Or it has to be done using javascript?
[21:53:07] <jeffreylevesque> food is an excellent idea
[21:56:17] <jonkersjoe> Whirl3d:  Hey thanks for the comments, I've had a look through it. I've removed obj.Item = {}; from the secondFunc and it is updating privateVar the way I want. So I'm back to my dilema on how to remove all the attributes of a object, essentially I want remove attributee/property a and b in the secondFunc and then recreate attribute/property 'a' with a new value.
[21:59:47] <jonkersjoe> I suppose I'm looking for soemthing like var abc = {a: "asdasd", b:"asdasd"}; delete abc.a; but I'm looking delete all the properties a and b in one statement

[22:20:29] <granden> Hi, how could I make this script more dynamic, so it would work no mather hov many or few images I got inthe div with id tools?
[22:20:32] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/pspmr/1/
[22:20:53] <granden> (For some reason not working on jsfiddle, but works great on my site, hyrmac.se.loopiadns.com
[22:27:39] <shoky> granden
[22:27:54] <granden> shoky:
[22:27:57] <shoky> here's one way http://jsfiddle.net/AZad4/
[22:28:57] <granden> shoky: Cool, is it only for me or does setInterval() not work on jsfiddle?
[22:29:09] <shoky> works fine for me
[22:29:10] <david`> hi
[22:29:16] <david`> is this wrong: if($('ul li:contains('+ new_shipping_country +')').length){ } ?
[22:29:22] <granden> shoky: Even my link?
[22:29:29] <shoky> granden yeah it works good
[22:29:30] <shoky> for me
[22:29:47] <shoky> your fiddle link, that is, didn't go to your site
[22:30:03] <thomedy> o
[22:30:10] <coldhead> david`: depends on the contents of new_shipping_country
[22:30:23] <granden> shoky: Yeah, only linked the site because I thought the fiddle could not handle setInterval.
[22:30:27] <thomedy> okay i want to write a plugin for my jquery... here is my question....
[22:30:29] <granden> No need to visit the site.
[22:30:33] <david`> coldhead i just wonder if that is the right way to put a var into that?
[22:30:36] <granden> shoky: Thanks a lot!
[22:30:37] <shoky> granden: weird that it doesn't work for you
[22:30:39] <david`> inside single quotes?
[22:30:42] <shoky> granden np
[22:30:51] <coldhead> yeah that's fine david`
[22:30:54] <granden> shoky: Tried like three different browsers as well, opera, chrome and safari.
[22:30:56] <thomedy> if i am trying to bind an transitionend event that is an effect or is that an event itself
[22:30:57] <david`> alright thanks :)
[22:31:12] <shoky> granden: that's really weird, then :)
[22:31:26] <granden> yeah :)
[22:31:41] <david`> coldhead if i want to turn that if statment into the opposite, like if it does *not* exist, how would syntax be?
[22:31:42] <granden> But hey what ever works... oh snap it did not work ;)
[22:31:50] <david`> the@
[22:32:00] <coldhead> if (! ...)
[22:32:07] <david`> oh :D
[22:32:09] <david`> like in php
[22:32:09] <david`> nice
[22:32:12] <coldhead> or if (... .length === 0)
[22:32:17] <david`> :D
[22:32:18] <david`> so simple
[22:32:30] <david`> thansk
[22:32:34] <david`> thanks* :p
[22:33:52] <david`> coldhead btw, new_shipping_country is a string
[22:34:33] <sa2304> Hello everyone, I want to know when user clicks a link inside of an iframe, can you tell me why $.delegate does not works in this way? http://jsfiddle.net/pyNNT/
[22:35:39] <coldhead> david`: but if it contains special characters that jQuery cares about it will break your selector
[22:35:58] <david`> coldhead how can i avoid that?
[22:36:03] <cluelesscoder> anyone up for taking a look at my code to help me figure out why my select isn't working? code is at https://gist.github.com/3072712 and website is at http://www.badcapitalist.com/test.html#stocksloaded
[22:36:48] <coldhead> david`: just avoid having ( or ) in your string, mostly
[22:37:21] <cluelesscoder> david': second paragraph at http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ might be helpful
[22:38:27] <sa2304> ?delegate
[22:38:27] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:39:08] <david`> coldhead can`t sanitize the string?
[22:39:25] <david`> cluelesscoder thanks!
[22:40:07] <freazy> Hi, do anyone know a tutorial for a mouse controlled slider like here http://www.flowslider.com/example.html ?
[22:41:18] <simon> freazy, why not just copy it?
[22:41:45] <freazy> because its illegal and i want to use it for a commercial site
[22:43:01] <simon> freazy, why don't you look at its source code and get inspired then? :)
[22:43:03] <tw2113> eh? what's illegal?
[22:43:43] <simon> freazy, maybe if you look at the source code, you'll find a liberal license.
[22:44:20] <freazy> copy and pase this project
[22:45:51] <shoky> sa2304: http://jsfiddle.net/pyNNT/2/
[22:46:10] <simon> freazy, ah, I see.
[22:47:26] <cluelesscoder> anyone have any idea on what's wrong with my select? code is at https://gist.github.com/3072712 and website is at http://www.badcapitalist.com/test.html#stocksloaded - selector is $(extraSector).insertAfter('stock'+stock.stock_id+'\\&sector'+stock.sector_id);
[22:47:50] <simon> freazy, just look for a similar script that is free.
[22:48:35] <sa2304> shoky: Thanks %) So I need to reuse $.delegate every time i reload an iframe, am i right?
[22:48:58] <simon> freazy, it seems that most image sliders have those arrows at each end and only serve one image at a time.
[22:49:13] <shoky> sa2304: i guess :P
[22:50:02] <shoky> sa2304: and of course, i had to change the url so the domains will match
[22:51:18] <sa2304> shoky: I noticed :) So, this way it would be better to use just $.bind or $.click I guess.
[22:51:52] <shoky> sa2304: if you want to handle clicks on all links, it's better to use .delegate (or even better, .on )
[22:52:02] <shoky> regardless of iframe or not
[22:53:00] <shoky> but yeah the gist of what you said is true
[22:53:46] <sa2304> shoky: thanks a lot %)
[22:53:48] <simon> if I end up using the idiom (function(x) { my regular code; })(x); am I then doing something wrong? it looks hackish.
[22:54:30] <shoky> np sa2304
[22:55:01] <shoky> simon: that's one of the most common idioms in javascript. it's not wrong at all
[22:55:16] <shoky> unless you're using it wrong :P
[22:55:51] <shoky> or, for the wrong purpose
[22:58:57] <simon> shoky, ok :)
[23:00:05] <Workoh> Quick question: Can you import a canvas element like a .JS file?
[23:01:15] <cluelesscoder> hmm
[23:04:58] <cluelesscoder> does anyone see any problem with this selector? $(extraSector).insertAfter('select[id="stock'+stock.stock_id+'\\&sector'+stock.sector_id+'"]');
[23:06:25] <cluelesscoder> it is modeled after a selector that is working for me, $(sectorOption).appendTo('select[id="'+howmanyplus+'sector"]');
[23:06:51] <cluelesscoder> I got this to work after removing the variables from the id and the selector
[23:06:58] <cluelesscoder> so the variables seem to be throwing it off...
[23:07:38] <Cork> cluelesscoder: echo the generated string
[23:07:45] <styol> cluelesscoder: ID's should be unique so ('#' + howmanyplus + 'selector')
[23:07:54] <Cork> console.log('select[id="stock'+stock.stock_id+'\\&sector'+stock.sector_id+'"]') that is
[23:08:12] <Cork> true
[23:08:25] <cluelesscoder> hmm, yet that's the one that works
[23:08:50] <Cork> cluelesscoder: what does console.log('stock'+stock.stock_id+'\\&sector'+stock.sector_id) give you?
[23:09:06] <cluelesscoder> should I just alert that?
[23:09:12] <Cork> sure
[23:09:24] <Cork> (not sure why you think an alert is better though)
[23:10:40] <cluelesscoder> the console confuses me a bit, heh
[23:10:43] <cluelesscoder> alert sends out firebugIgnore
[23:10:47] <coldhead> ?alert
[23:10:48] <bot-t> Forget alertuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browsers built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[23:11:22] <Cork> cluelesscoder: you put it before your old insert line?
[23:12:07] <cluelesscoder> Cork: put it after, but earlier I put it before
[23:12:18] <cluelesscoder> err rather I just switched it to before when you asked
[23:12:36] <cluelesscoder> when I tried this in Firebug, there was some sort of ReferenceError
[23:12:37] <Cork> ok, so theres something wrong with your variables
[23:12:59] <cluelesscoder> actually it seems to be returning something
[23:13:00] <Cork> console.log each one of them and see what they output
[23:13:22] <cluelesscoder> select[id="stock3\&sector2"]
[23:13:26] <cluelesscoder> that's what is being returned
[23:13:37] <Cork> no it not
[23:13:40] <Cork> defenitly not
[23:13:46] <cluelesscoder> ah yeah
[23:13:53] <cluelesscoder> not sure why that's showing up in my console
[23:14:27] <cluelesscoder> you think there's something wrong with my variables because of the ReferenceError?
[23:14:47] <Cork> 1. comment out your insertAfter
[23:14:55] <Cork> 2. console.log each variable in the string
[23:15:14] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: whats the name of the website where you upload photos?
[23:15:22] <Cork> 3. convert your selector to '#stock'+stock.stock_id+'\\&sector'+stock.sector_id
[23:15:27] <cluelesscoder> is the console really appropriate when I'm pulling data from a database using XMLHttpRequest?
[23:15:29] <Cork> it should do the same thing but faster
[23:15:38] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: imagebin
[23:15:42] <cluelesscoder> I think that's why I get the ReferenceError
[23:15:57] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: nope, theres another one.
[23:15:59] <cluelesscoder> incidentally, http://www.badcapitalist.com/test.html#stocksloaded is the website - I referenced it earlier
[23:16:01] <Cork> cluelesscoder: its just js pushing things to the console
[23:16:12] <Cork> as long as it runs in the browser it should work fine
[23:16:31] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: well, its the one i use
[23:16:43] <cluelesscoder> these variables are part of a .getJSON loop
[23:16:53] <david`> how can i delete a <li> with a certain content?
[23:17:25] <ruby_on_tails> david`: if($("li").html() == "asd") {$("li").remove();}
[23:17:33] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: sure, you know of others?
[23:17:47] <Cork> never needed any other one
[23:18:10] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: thanks corky.
[23:18:14] <david`> ruby_on_tails so i have to go through all li`s ?
[23:18:27] <ruby_on_tails> if you want a filter based on the content, you do have to
[23:18:35] <Cork> david`: $('li').filter(function() { return $(this).html() == 'match this'; }).remove();
[23:19:14] <Cork> david`: use it on what ever selector you want
[23:20:07] <krz> dammit
[23:20:16] <krz> aren't there any decent truncating scripts out there
[23:20:48] <Cork> truncating?
[23:20:56] <krz> yea
[23:20:58] <Cork> what is it you want to do?
[23:21:07] <krz> foo bar foo ...
[23:21:10] <sa2304> ?on
[23:21:11] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:21:26] <Cork> krz: so you want to add elips?
[23:21:35] <krz> yea based on length
[23:21:55] <Cork> and it should split at closest word?
[23:22:12] <krz> just at length
[23:22:20] <ruby_on_tails> thats a simple substring thing
[23:22:22] <Cork> one option is to use css text-overflow
[23:22:32] <krz> so if length is 4 it would be "foob..."
[23:22:50] <krz> thats not compatible with older browsers
[23:22:56] <Cork> ya, i know
[23:23:08] <ruby_on_tails> string.substring(0, 4) + "..."
[23:23:20] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ah found it, FYI, http://imgur.com/
[23:23:32] <Cork> yup
[23:23:39] <krz> ruby_on_tails: is there a script?
[23:23:47] <ruby_on_tails> why do you need a script ?
[23:23:48] <Cork> krz: thats all you need
[23:23:49] <ruby_on_tails> its a 1 liner
[23:23:52] <krz> rather not have to do a condition everytime
[23:23:57] <krz> its not a 1 liner
[23:24:00] <ruby_on_tails> it is
[23:24:18] <Cork> well he want to conditionally add the ...
[23:24:19] <ruby_on_tails> just apply it on all string, though, i think this should be handled server side
[23:24:48] <ruby_on_tails> then do something like if(string.length > 4) string = string.substring(0, 4) + "..."
[23:25:03] <ruby_on_tails> add whatever clause you want there
[23:25:06] <krz> ruby_on_tails: id do it server side. sometimes it has to be done client side
[23:25:32] <Cork> or simply doing: string.substring(0, len) + (string.length > len ? "..." : "")
[23:25:48] <david`> ruby_on_tails shouldn`t this work: $('ul li:contains(' + new_shipping_country + ')').remove(); ?
[23:25:53] <ruby_on_tails> ok, in that case you can add some clauses according to your requirements and use it
[23:26:15] <Cork> david`: its basically the same that i gave you, but its slower ans a bit riskier
[23:26:21] <Cork> ans==and
[23:27:05] <ruby_on_tails> isnt contains for checking if an element has another dom element ?
[23:27:11] <Cork> no
[23:27:13] <ruby_on_tails> contains works for string check ?
[23:27:20] <ruby_on_tails> ?contains
[23:27:21] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[23:27:30] <ruby_on_tails> oh
[23:27:32] <Cork> it checks for serialized string
[23:27:32] <ruby_on_tails> ok :contains
[23:27:36] <ruby_on_tails> i was looking at .contains
[23:27:48] <Cork> ?.contains
[23:27:49] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[23:27:54] <Cork> bah.
[23:28:00] <Cork> its the same thing though
[23:28:16] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:28:41] <Cork> hmm at least it should be >_>
[23:28:48] <Cork> but the doc says something completly different
[23:28:55] * Cork checks the source again
[23:29:48] <Cork> yuck...
[23:29:53] <Cork> ok... didn't know that
[23:30:12] <Cork> no $.contains is an exposure of sizzles .contains >_>
[23:30:27] <Cork> so its something completely different
[23:30:37] <Cork> thats.... logical... >_<
[23:31:08] <david`> can i remove it by a certain value?
[23:31:26] <Cork> david`: sure
[23:31:36] <david`> how?
[23:31:45] <Cork> ok, lets back up a bit
[23:31:50] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[23:32:20] <david`> removing a li from ul by a given value
[23:32:35] <Cork> and the value is stored where and how?
[23:32:49] <david`> in a variable
[23:32:58] <Cork> uh...
[23:33:02] <Cork> in the dom
[23:33:14] <david`> yes
[23:33:23] <Cork> T_T
[23:33:36] <david`> man i just need to know the syntax for removing it by its value :P
[23:33:42] <david`> you can see the code when i am done
[23:33:44] <Cork> david`: your giving absolutely no information what so ever; you know that right?
[23:34:16] <david`> i want to remove a <li> from a <ul> by a certain value
[23:34:43] <david`> wait
[23:34:49] <Cork> ya, you've explained that you have a variable that you want to match against something thats somehow related to an li
[23:34:50] <david`> sorry i am so tired!
[23:34:53] <Cork> but not the last part...
[23:35:00] <david`> li`s doesn`t have values
[23:35:03] <david`> x)
[23:35:05] <david`> gah
[23:36:05] <ruby_on_tails> david tell the real life scenario of what you are trying to do
[23:36:51] <david`> ok, this is how the li looks like:
[23:37:04] <Cork> ?p @ david_mark
[23:37:05] <bot-t> david_mark, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:37:09] <Cork> *david`:
[23:37:09] <david`> <li><span class="shipping_location">Norway</span></li>
[23:37:51] <david`> i want to remove that li, by the content of span class="shipping_location"
[23:38:07] <Cork> and whats in your variable?
[23:38:12] <Cork> (case matters)
[23:38:18] <david`> Norway
[23:38:53] <ruby_on_tails> $(".shipping_location").parent().remove();
[23:39:07] <shoky> ..
[23:39:12] <ruby_on_tails> sorry
[23:39:14] <ruby_on_tails> my bad
[23:39:24] <david`> that would remove everything with .shipping_location
[23:39:27] <Cork> $('li .shipping_location').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == new_shipping_country }).parent().remove();
[23:39:34] <Cork> that should do the trick
[23:39:38] <david`> Cork lets see :)
[23:39:44] <ruby_on_tails> yes use Cork's code
[23:40:04] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: how to echo out the html tag using jquery?
[23:40:20] <shoky> printf
[23:40:28] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: not sure what you mean
[23:40:29] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: <img class="foo">
[23:40:38] <Cork> you want to show the html on the page?
[23:40:42] <ruby_on_tails> !outerhtml
[23:40:43] <Cork> or render it
[23:40:50] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: lets say i got html <img class="foo">
[23:40:51] <ruby_on_tails> ?outerhtml
[23:40:52] <bot-t> jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[23:41:31] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: now i get it using $img = $('img.foo');
[23:41:50] <cluelesscoder> m
[23:41:52] <Cork> ok, so your getting the dom element
[23:42:08] <david`> this if statment: if($('ul li:contains('+ new_shipping_country +')').length === 0)
[23:42:15] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: now i want to echo the dom element into html
[23:42:21] <david`> i need to change it to match the span instead
[23:42:34] <david`> <li><span class="shipping_location">Norway</span></li>
[23:42:47] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork:$img.outerHTML()
[23:42:50] <david`> gah, i need to learn jquery!
[23:42:53] <Cork> david`: sigh... why didn't you try the code i gave you ?!?
[23:43:01] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork:?
[23:43:09] <david`> Cork i did! need to change something else to make it work :)
[23:43:27] <david`> Cork it is a lot more code than this :P
[23:43:52] <shoky> david`:  var lisToRemove = $('li .shipping_location').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == new_shipping_country }).parent()
[23:44:12] <david`> shoky ...
[23:44:32] <Cork> david`: in other words if lisToRemove.lenght === 0
[23:44:36] <shoky> david` ... if (lisToRemove.length == 0)
[23:44:37] <Cork> its the same as your if statement
[23:45:01] <Cork> but instead of running the selector each time
[23:45:08] <Cork> you store your match and runs it once instead
[23:45:21] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: $img.outerHTML(); <-- did not work.
[23:45:47] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: $('<div/>').html($img.clone()).html()
[23:45:56] <Cork> sorry that i didn't answer before
[23:46:03] <ruby_on_tails> BoMbMoNkEy: did you check that link ?
[23:46:09] <ruby_on_tails> !outerhtml
[23:46:12] <BoMbMoNkEy> ruby_on_tails: yep
[23:46:13] <ruby_on_tails> ?outerhtml
[23:46:14] <bot-t> jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[23:46:19] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: not really a need for a plugin
[23:46:22] <ruby_on_tails> use the snippet in the link
[23:46:33] <ruby_on_tails> its not a plugin, simple snippet
[23:46:55] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: almost same as what you said $('<div>').append( this.eq(0).clone() ).html();
[23:47:19] <Cork> jQuery.fn.outerHTML <-- thats a plugin :)
[23:47:25] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:47:45] <ruby_on_tails> then use the code inside it :P
[23:47:58] <Cork> it won't work straight off
[23:48:06] <Cork> cause its built to work from inside a plugin
[23:48:10] <shoky> are there browsers that don't support node.outerHTML ?
[23:48:16] <Cork> yes
[23:48:37] <dziegler> Q: Hi i have a question with the NoConflict funktion. I use mostly prototype.js in my Webproject (old project) but sometimes i have to juse jQuery becaus it have realy cool functions :-) But with t jqplot addon i have the problem that all in undefined. The script works fine on my dev system(jquery only) but on my realy system i include prototype + jquery. So i tryed to use the noConflict funktion but i dont know ho to use it in the orginal jqplot.js
[23:49:19] <Cork> shoky: most noticeably firefox > 5months old
[23:49:53] <ruby_on_tails> hmm

[23:50:21] <david`> ok guys here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/UunYA/

[23:50:44] <david`> what i want to do is:
[23:50:44] <cluelesscoder> so do quotes always have to be escaped in javascript? what's the consequence if they are not?
[23:50:45] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: no such thing as <div/>
[23:50:59] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: there is
[23:51:00] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: in $('<div/>').html($img.clone()).html()
[23:51:12] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: <div/> is the same as <div></div>
[23:51:25] <Cork> <div> is a none closed tag
[23:51:26] <david`> when you add a country that already exists, the country is removed from the li-list and added again
[23:51:44] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: ok
[23:52:22] <Cork> BoMbMoNkEy: its not valid html, but the dom parser know how it works
[23:52:48] <Cork> the /> is from xml
[23:52:58] <Cork> (so its valid xhtml)
[23:53:56] <david`> Cork can you help me a bit?
[23:54:40] <Cork> david`: so if it exists you want to do nothing?
[23:55:01] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: this explains what I am doing, see http://jsfiddle.net/VZL3z/

[23:59:26] <Cork> ah
[23:59:31] <BoMbMoNkEy> Cork: its all documented.
