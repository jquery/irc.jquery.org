[00:03:30] <shoky> huh
[00:03:45] <shoky> all he needs is to use .css :\  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ad7PW/5/
[00:08:12] <angryasian> there's no need to be manually filling in stuff that belongs as a css rule
[00:08:17] <angryasian> he just needs to add in a class
[00:08:38] <angryasian> and yes .css is the correct thing to do.
[00:08:42] <shoky> angryasian: your fiddle doesn't even use the class
[00:08:46] <angryasian> if you do want to add in 50things.
[00:09:04] <angryasian> wtf. I keep changing it and not updating it
[00:09:04] <shoky> you made another global 'var div' that is not being used anywhere
[00:09:05] <angryasian> I'm a noob
[00:09:28] <angryasian> http://jsfiddle.net/ad7PW/7/
[00:09:32] <angryasian> that is what i meant to do
[00:09:53] <shoky> that's another way, yea
[00:11:12] <angryasian> yep we're both correct. I think the OP's going to prefer your way better though as that's how he initially wanted to do things.
[00:11:44] <shoky> or he might see the wisdom in yours ;p
[00:11:59] <shoky> or he might be long gone and moved on
[00:37:30] <clu3> I'm looking for a plugin that makes the post's title sticky when the page is scrolling like what's in http://9gag.com/ but i haven't been able to find one, any suggesttions?
[00:39:49] <Cork> clu3: your talking about the dark gray bar at the top?
[00:42:39] <Lucky--> Unable to uninstall 'Microsoft.Data.Services.Client 5.1.0-rc2' because 'Microsoft.Data.Services 5.1.0-rc2' depend(s) on it. . . .
[00:42:53] <Cork> lol
[00:43:03] <Cork> one up for ms there :)
[00:43:07] <Lucky--> yea
[00:44:08] <thinkerweb> Would you use $("buttonID").click, or is there another way with button element?
[00:44:24] <Cork> nope
[00:44:33] <Lucky--> $("#buttonID").click(function(){doSomething();});
[00:44:42] <Cork> thats what he meant ya
[00:45:00] <Lucky--> $(".buttonClass").click(function(){doSomething();});
[00:45:00] <thinkerweb> Lucky--, thx
[00:45:02] <Lucky--> np
[00:45:11] <Cork> thinkerweb: button elements doesn't have a target or src attribut
[00:45:19] <Cork> so only way is through js
[00:45:55] <Lucky--> good idea gone fail: http://gridster.net/
[00:46:02] <Lucky--> you have to declare the grid in html on the page
[00:46:04] <Lucky--> :-/
[00:46:16] <Lucky--> i spent about an hour trying to get it to work with knockout and dynamically binding widgets
[00:47:26] <thinkerweb> This doesn't seem to work for me in my $.ajax(): data: {email: "field_email", budget: "field_budget", description = "field_description"}
[00:47:52] <Lucky--> thinkerweb: yea, what url you going to?
[00:47:58] <Lucky--> and $.ajax takes an object with config options
[00:48:07] <Lucky--> thats just basically calling it as a paramaterless void function
[00:48:14] <Lucky--> which aint going to do much
[00:48:48] <shoky> thinkerweb:  you have description=  instead of description:
[00:49:04] <thinkerweb> shoky, thx
[00:50:20] <Lucky--> $.ajax({url: 'urltosendto',data:{budget: "field_budget", description: "field_Description"}, success: function(data){doSomethingWith(data)});
[00:51:00] <shoky> he didnt say that he's calling it with no argument ;p
[00:51:03] <shoky> arguments*
[00:56:00] <vedic> Hi I am testing a page on Safari. I have got [<span class='refine'></span>] as $(this) but when I do $(this).remove() it doesn't actually delete this node.
[00:56:42] <noregret> anybody uses this plugin, http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised/
[00:56:48] <Cork> vedic: your sure the node is the one in the selector?
[00:57:08] <Cork> vedic: you think you can create a fiddle?
[00:57:15] <Lucky--> noregret: sammyjs is what I, google, and a bunch of others use
[00:57:21] <Lucky--> works flawlessly
[00:59:20] <noregret> Lucky--: cool, in the format field, what is exactly the use of "c" ? and does it matter where it is located in the format string ?
[00:59:51] <Lucky--> noregret: http://sammyjs.org/
[00:59:59] <Lucky--> it can either be regex
[01:00:02] <Lucky--> or hashes
[01:00:34] <Lucky--> http://sammyjs.org/docs/routes
[01:01:47] <noregret> Lucky--: i was talking about a pagination plugin.. that's all..
[01:01:57] <Lucky--> yea
[01:02:10] <Lucky--> you want to have a single page
[01:02:12] <Lucky--> site
[01:02:16] <Lucky--> with multiple views
[01:02:22] <koosha> is there any way to pass a Perl like regex to RegExp function
[01:02:41] <noregret> yeah.. but I'm already almost done.. i dno'ot need to recreate js using sammy..
[01:02:42] <koosha> that is replace \\ with \ and \ with \\ at the same time
[01:02:46] <vedic> Cork: Sorry, had to restart the laptop.
[01:03:37] <noregret> Lucky--: i'll consider it in later projects..
[01:03:41] <Cork> koosha: you would have to run it through a pre-processing javascript function (so in other words, no)
[01:05:00] <Lucky--> noregret: you dont need to recreate anything
[01:05:04] <vedic> cORK: I have got [<span class='refine'>test</span>] as console.log($(this)) . I have checked that when I do $(this).remove() it simply removes 'test' the text inside the <span> element. But doesn't actually remove the element itself
[01:05:06] <Lucky--> sammy is not a whole new framework
[01:05:10] <vedic> Cork:
[01:05:10] <Lucky--> its just binding a callback to a hash
[01:05:18] <Lucky--> and sammy catches it when it sees that hash in the nav
[01:05:23] <Lucky--> super simple
[01:05:32] <Cork> ?p @ vedic
[01:05:33] <bot-t> vedic, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:05:45] <angelazou> if the property of an object is stored in a variable, will objname.varname allow me to access it?
[01:05:51] <Lucky--> this.get('#/page2',function(){doSomething();});
[01:06:06] <Lucky--> and anytime some clicks a link that is #/page2 it doesSomething
[01:06:11] <Cork> angelazou: objname[varname]
[01:07:29] <angelazou> ah, thanks, can i store it back to var like so .... varname = 'objectname[' + varname +']'; ?
[01:07:45] <Cork> you can copy the content yes
[01:07:52] <Cork> but it won't reference
[01:08:08] <angelazou> well, I don't need to write to it, just read the values
[01:08:26] <shoky> var bla = objname[varname];
[01:08:27] <Cork> what i meant is that its a snapshot in time
[01:08:43] <koosha> Cork: I want to pass patterns like "\d+\w+" not "\\d+\\w+"
[01:08:47] <koosha> is there any way?
[01:08:53] <dblosevn> use an object
[01:09:02] <koosha> that's annoying
[01:09:02] <dblosevn> all onjects are passed by reference
[01:09:09] <dblosevn> *objects
[01:10:22] <koosha> in other word, is there any other way than RegExp object to convert a string to RE?
[01:10:27] <vedic> Cork: on jsfiddle.net it is removing. But it doesn't work here
[01:10:40] <Cork> koosha: /\d+\w+/.test('123alskdjs')
[01:10:55] <Cork> koosha: the extra \ has nothing to do with regex, its string escape
[01:11:01] <Lucky--> i hate swaping back n forth between doing alot of c# and js, i start getting my casing all messed up
[01:11:10] <koosha> Cork: No, I'm manipulating a library to get the RE as a user input
[01:11:14] <Lucky--> and start writing my c# like a mess of chained anonymous functions
[01:11:22] <Cork> vedic: prob cause your removing it from another element
[01:11:32] <koosha> the RE is not predefined
[01:11:42] <Cork> koosha: it shouldn't be a problem from user input
[01:13:26] <koosha> Cork: the problem is a bit complex. The input is received in PHP and then passed to JS
[01:13:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/M3RYY/
[01:14:11] <Cork> koosha: yes and \ needs to be escaped in js static strings
[01:14:54] <dblosevn> just add slashes to it before exporting it to js
[01:15:40] <dblosevn> var myregexp = '<?php echo addslashes($regexp);?>';
[01:16:52] <dblosevn> or var myregexp = <?php echo $myregexp;?>; it would already be a regex then
[01:17:13] <dblosevn> no need to escape it
[01:17:23] <Cork> koosha: to explain it a bit clearer, the backslash isn't needed by javascript, its needed by the parser
[01:17:37] <Cork> dblosevn: only if it had // around it
[01:17:47] <dblosevn> assuming it did :-)
[01:17:56] <Cork> not if you pass it to RegExp
[01:18:25] <Cork> ?eval var r = new RegExp('\\d+\\w+'); r.test('134123tsets')
[01:18:25] * koosha is thinking about what others are saying
[01:18:31] <bot-t> Cork: true
[01:19:04] <dblosevn> <?php $regep = '/w+/';?>var myregexp = <?php echo $regexp;?>;
[01:19:36] <dblosevn> except i didnt escape w+ grr
[01:20:04] <dblosevn> it wouldnt have had to be escaped though because it came from a post
[01:21:05] <koosha> thanks Cork and dblosevn
[01:21:16] <dblosevn> (y)
[01:21:59] <louism2__> hey everyone, this is probably a fairly noob questions but if I insert content via ajax, is that content then visible to a subsequent jquery method that occurs before the page reloads?
[01:22:21] <koosha> I'll see what the best is
[01:22:25] <dblosevn> that doesnt even make since
[01:22:43] <dblosevn> if its ajax the page shouldnt reload @ louism2
[01:22:44] <Cork> louism2__: depends if you append it to the page, or add it to a variable thats in the same scope
[01:23:33] <Cork> and yes, if the page reload starts at the same time as your doing your ajax call, you won't have a chance to react
[01:23:54] <louism2__> sorry, that was a terrible explanation.... I am inserting a div via ajax.  If I then go call a jquery method that searches through the dom for an id or something, will that id of the div that I inserted via ajax be visible?
[01:24:09] <shoky> yes
[01:25:02] <louism2__> shoky: is it as simple as grabbing it using a jquery selector statement or do I have to approach it differently?
[01:25:07] <angelazou> according to this, I'm supposed to be able to get the data-*attribute using .data function
[01:25:27] <shoky> louism2__:  it's as simple as that yes. it can be even simpler if you save a reference to the inserted div and just use that
[01:25:34] <angelazou>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2487747/selecting-element-by-data-attribute
[01:25:40] <Cork> louism2__: if its in the dom its in the dom, no difference
[01:25:47] <angelazou> but when I do i get this error message Uncaught TypeError: Object file:///C:/Users/centilin/Downloads/HTML5%20Project/test/index.html#page2 has no method 'data'
[01:26:03] <Cork> louism2__: js sees no difference between content comming from the original html, or dynamically added
[01:26:22] <louism2__> cork and shoky... thanks for the help
[01:26:38] <louism2__> must be a syntax thing
[01:26:48] <shoky> ?p @ angelazou
[01:26:49] <bot-t> angelazou, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:27:01] <shoky> oh
[01:27:06] <louism2__> I am having issues grabbing a div using an id of a div that was dynamically inserted
[01:27:14] <shoky> angelazou: you're calling .data on a string, it seems..
[01:27:59] <shoky> angelazou: also selecting by data-attribute has nothing to do with the .data(..) function
[01:28:03] <Cork> louism2__: check the past link up there and provide one please :)
[01:28:26] <Cork> shoky: uh.. it will select data-attibutes
[01:28:30] <Cork> *attributes
[01:28:34] <shoky> what?
[01:28:37] <Cork> yes
[01:28:38] <angelazou> ehh, that's weird, cuz when I tried to use .attr to get the value it says the attribute doesn't exist
[01:28:45] <shoky> .data just retrieves the data, it doesn't select anything
[01:28:46] <louism2__> Cork: not following you....
[01:29:13] <Cork> louism2__: provide a working snippet with for your problem
[01:29:16] <angelazou> yes, I mean I am using it on an objec
[01:29:26] <Cork> ?testcase @ louism2__
[01:29:27] <bot-t> louism2__, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[01:29:30] <Cork> uh...
[01:29:35] <Cork> ?demo @ louism2__
[01:29:36] <bot-t> louism2__, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:29:39] <louism2__> Cork: ahhhh, I am going to fiddle for a second
[01:29:39] <shoky> angelazou: it looks like you're calling .data on a URL String
[01:29:55] <angelazou> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/uLGR6/
[01:30:09] <angelazou> it's just a snippet cuz the actual code is quite big
[01:30:18] <Cork> $(this).data not this.data
[01:30:20] <shoky> angelazou:  $(this).data
[01:30:36] <shoky> and $(this).on
[01:30:44] <angelazou> ah, thanks
[01:32:32] <xkr47> xkr.us, nicely matches my nick :)
[01:32:35] <shoky> angelazou: you're calling  $('audio#audio' + key).on("ended",  ...   on each click
[01:32:40] <thinkerweb> I have a <button id="myID">Send</button> inside a <form id="someid>...</form> for some reason, but clicks still seems to submit the form and refresh page with I don't want cause I am trying to use ajax instead"
[01:32:41] <shoky> angelazou: that adds an event handler each time you click
[01:32:55] <TheBrayn> is it not possible to bind .change to an element referenced by an id?
[01:33:09] <TheBrayn> I want to watch for changes in a select element but it only works with a class
[01:33:14] <shoky> thinkerweb:  $('#myform').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  .... })
[01:33:50] <Cork> TheBrayn: the event handler doesn't care about the selector
[01:33:58] <Cork> it works on a list of matched elements
[01:34:20] <Cork> $() generates a list and .change works on that list
[01:34:39] <Cork> so as long as your selector matches the element you want, .change works
[01:36:16] <thinkerweb> shoky, thx
[01:37:14] <Cork> TheBrayn: just to be sure, you know that you can't have multiple elements with the same id right?
[01:40:35] <TheBrayn> yes I know that
[01:43:42] <zest> I have a problem with jquery. I have p's with inputs. I alter the contents of text in p's but, when I update it back.. the values of inputs are gone..
[01:43:47] <zest> what's the problem with html()?
[01:44:17] <zest> I used .html() to get the html in <p> but the values of inputs in it are all gone.\
[01:44:18] <zest> why so?
[01:46:02] <Cork> zest: your modifying html
[01:46:08] <Cork> then you replace everything inside the dom
[01:46:21] <zest> I only replace the label texts
[01:46:27] <zest> but all the input values are gone..
[01:46:33] <Cork> in html and then replace everything afterwards
[01:46:52] <Cork> .html == .innerHTML == remove everything and parse this html to dom
[01:47:16] <zest> what do you mean by that?
[01:47:21] <zest> Is there a get around it?
[01:47:26] <DukeDrake> hi
[01:47:37] <Cork> yes, make sure your text isn't mixed around your input fields
[01:47:41] <Cork> and modify the dom instead
[01:48:02] <DukeDrake> what would I need to generate a downloaddialog for a clientside genereated file?
[01:48:14] <Cork> zest: $(parent).find('label').each(function() { $(this).text('new text'); });
[01:49:02] <zest> Ok.. Will try that..
[01:49:07] <Cork> DukeDrake: you would have to generate a data uri and load it as a resource
[01:49:15] <Selfarian> Hello
[01:52:11] <Selfarian> I want to use jquery for an form with autocomplete. So i found an coding example: http://pastebin.com/pBk90Z6Y
[01:52:41] <Selfarian> So i wonder if this part needs to be in the <head>-Part of the HTML Document, or if it could be in the <body> part, too
[01:53:05] <Selfarian> my problem is, that i use joomla and so it's a little difficult to add this to the header ;)
[01:53:13] <Cork> Selfarian: in head or end of body is fine
[01:53:36] <Cork> and the ready is only needed if you put it in head
[01:54:08] <Cork> if you put it in body and not at the end of the body you HAVE to put it after all the elements your trying to reference
[01:54:19] <Cork> else the elements won't exist when the code runs
[01:56:17] <zest> Thanks lots COrk!
[01:56:24] <zest> Worked great :)
[01:56:49] <angelazou> simple question, I have a simple if that triggers a function, if(type == 'imageImageFlip') { 		IIF(pair, bodySelector); 	}
[01:57:17] <angelazou> but the function never get called
[01:57:31] <Cork> so the if statement is never true?
[01:57:31] <DukeDrake> Cork: excellent .... not sure though if I know what a datauri is ^^
[01:57:44] <Cork> ?g data-uri
[01:57:44] <angelazou> no, the if is true
[01:57:47] <angelazou> but the function doesn't get called
[01:57:48] <bot-t> Cork, Data URI scheme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme
[01:58:11] <thinkerweb> this isn't working for me:  $("#wehavebademail").append("Invalid Email").fadeOut(2000).empty().show();
[01:58:13] <Cork> ?g generate data uri online
[01:58:14] <DukeDrake> thanx =)

[01:58:20] <DukeDrake> heh
[01:58:28] <Cork> bah thats wrong
[01:58:38] <Cork> http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/cgi/data/data
[01:58:39] <thinkerweb> it works up to fadeOut() but empty & show not so much
[01:59:18] <Cork> thinkerweb: you need to use the callback
[01:59:22] <Cork> ?.fadeOut
[01:59:24] <bot-t> .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[01:59:28] <DukeDrake> would it also be possible to open a new windwo, set its mime type to something exotic, and fill with data?
[01:59:44] <Cork> should be possible
[01:59:55] <Cork> window.open('data:')
[02:00:04] <DukeDrake> heh? XD
[02:00:12] <xec_> angelazou: impossible to tell what's going wrong with so little information. maybe the function doesnt exist? is the if ever executed? how do you know that it evaluates to true?
[02:00:31] <angelazou> ahh, i see the problem
[02:00:46] <angelazou> the value of the variable didn't get inherited outside the function that assigned the value
[02:01:19] <angelazou> this is the paste, type is available inside the anonymous function http://jsfiddle.net/uLGR6/2/
[02:01:27] <angelazou> but it's not once outside
[02:01:37] <angelazou> how do I make the values available outside the function?
[02:01:40] <anli> How do I center an image inside a div? http://jsfiddle.net/yqvvL/1/
[02:01:42] <angelazou> variables i mean
[02:02:46] <angelazou> it's kind of weird since the variables are declared globally
[02:03:12] <tlkr> angelazou, define the variable with var outside the function.
[02:03:21] * xec_ cries
[02:03:28] <angelazou> I did, that's the weird part
[02:03:35] <angelazou> let me paste more
[02:03:45] <tlkr> put it on jsfiddle
[02:03:57] <Cork> anli: use background-image
[02:03:58] <xec_> angelazou: make sure you make it a working demo
[02:04:15] <Cork> anli: you can't center vertically in a div
[02:05:15] <anli> Cork: So I have to use a td instead?
[02:05:28] <xec_> angelazou: this is my guess: you're binding a click handler. the code inside will not execute until you click whatever (meaning any if statement following the bind is going to execute first, including any conditionals)
[02:05:44] <Cork> anli: please start reading the responses when you ask a question
[02:07:16] <angelazou> xec_: here you go
[02:07:25] <Selfarian> Cork: did you mean it like this way? http://pastebin.com/pBk90Z6Y
[02:07:35] <angelazou> yep, it's inside a click handler, but the if is only after the click function
[02:07:50] <angelazou> ah
[02:08:02] <Cork> Selfarian: yes, but you can remove jQuery(document){
[02:08:36] <Cork> Selfarian: i meant you can remove that function call completely
[02:08:41] <Selfarian> ok
[02:08:47] <Selfarian> i'll give it a try :)
[02:09:20] <Cork> and from your code i think you want to replace $('#passnrsearch_1') with jQuery('#passnrsearch_1')
[02:10:44] <xec_> anli: you can use table-cell display http://jsfiddle.net/yqvvL/7/
[02:12:22] <alfanso> Hi guys, how do I get a stripped down version of jQuery? I need only selector thing and css function. I dont need anything else?
[02:13:00] <xec_> alfanso: you can't at the moment afaik, unless you do the work manually yourself.
[02:13:09] <Cork> alfanso: theres no stripped down version
[02:13:29] <Cork> though that said, thats mainly sizzle and a short section for .css

[02:14:53] <Selfarian> hmm... doesn't work :(
[02:15:10] <Selfarian> Is there a simple option to test, if jQuery works?
[02:15:27] <Selfarian> ... i mean... if it's "running" :)
[02:16:11] <Cork> alert(jQuery.fn.jquery)

[02:16:57] <Cork> anli: why do you ask questions when you ignore the answers?
[02:17:07] <anli> Which answer did I ignore?
[02:17:17] <xec_> anli: the demo i pasted you does not inhibit that issue.
[02:17:19] <Selfarian> if i add this, there sould be an alert "popup" right? :/
[02:17:28] <Cork> Selfarian: yes
[02:17:32] <xec_> anli: read up here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Images,_Tables,_and_Mysterious_Gaps
[02:17:32] <anli> xec_: Must check
[02:17:43] <Selfarian> there's nothing :(
[02:17:57] <anli> _xec: Ah, thats cool!
[02:18:09] <Cork> Selfarian: and alert('works'); ?
[02:18:58] <Selfarian> yes
[02:19:01] <anli> Cork: One answer you gave was that centered vertical alignment is not possible in a div
[02:19:11] <anli> Cork: It would have been fortunate if I ignored that answer
[02:19:16] <Cork> anli: that was the follow up
[02:19:29] <Selfarian> ah, wait
[02:19:30] <Cork> the simple solution was the first answer
[02:19:30] <anli> _xec: just showed me how to do it
[02:19:33] <anli> oops
[02:19:37] <Selfarian> now it the popup wors :)
[02:19:38] <Selfarian> works
[02:19:50] <xec_> anli: it won't work in IE7 or older, but it's all but dead anyway
[02:19:56] <anli> yes
[02:19:57] <Cork> Selfarian: when you run the first alert do you get an error in your console?
[02:20:02] <alfanso> in console type window.jQuery
[02:20:02] <alfanso>  and hit Run. If you dont get response as undefined, that means it is loaded.
[02:20:04] <anli> IE7 is buried long time ago
[02:20:18] <anli> And its not a blocker if someone does not get the centering in my special case
[02:20:48] <Selfarian> Cork: i firstly added after my jQuery(............); and it didn't work. then i tried to ad it before and then there comes a popup with "1.7.1"
[02:21:24] <Cork> ok, thats the expected result
[02:21:30] <adam_lynch> For a JSON API, would it make sense to return a checksum of the list of results along with the list itself?
[02:21:36] <adam_lynch> so the receiving end could compare it with the last one and check if the result set has changed
[02:21:46] <Cork> Selfarian: do you have jquery-ui included on your page?
[02:21:50] <anli> _xec: Hm, I cant see how you made the horizontal alignment work
[02:22:13] <anli> Is table-cell implying centered horizontal alignment?
[02:22:23] <Selfarian> i don't think so... i just installed this: http://www.elovaris.at/en/downloads/jquery-includer
[02:22:31] <Cork> adam_lynch: prob not
[02:23:03] <Cork> Selfarian: try alert(jQuery.ui.version), it that fails you don't have what you need
[02:23:24] <xec_> anli: no that's the margin: 0 auto; on the img
[02:24:03] <Selfarian> damn... it fails ;)
[02:24:30] <Cork> ?jquery-ui @ Selfarian
[02:24:32] <bot-t> Selfarian, UI - jQuery Wiki - This is the official documentation for jQuery UI , jQuery's visual controls. jQuery UI features a wide range of core interaction plugins as well as many UI widgets . The project homepage is located... http://docs.jquery.com/UI
[02:24:44] <Cork> uh... that ones old...
[02:24:52] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui
[02:24:53] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/
[02:25:24] <adam_lynch> Cork: how come?
[02:26:23] <Cork> adam_lynch: cause a better option is to send a date for when the data changed
[02:26:52] <Cork> adam_lynch: and let the script send this date to the server, and the server can answer with "not changed" (304 if i remember correctly)
[02:27:27] <Cork> adam_lynch: that way your script doesn't have to parse it, the data doens't have to be transfered over the net
[02:27:33] <Cork> and the server doesn't have to generate it
[02:35:34] <adam_lynch> Cork: ya sounds good
[02:35:49] <adam_lynch> but the server needs to know when the data has been modified
[02:36:00] <Cork> yes
[02:36:02] <adam_lynch> in my case, it's using another API which doesn't reveal that
[02:36:40] <Cork> calculating a checksum is pointless cause calculating it client side would prob cost as much as just handling it
[02:37:13] <adam_lynch> Cork: great, that's xactly why I asked my question in the first place
[02:37:30] <dblosevn> could return a checksum in the server response, and send that back to the server on next poll
[02:37:44] <Cork> that could work
[02:38:11] <dblosevn> assuming the dataset is big enough to matter
[02:40:22] <Asone> Ohai people
[02:40:57] <Asone> stupide question : with a [attribute=value] selector, is there anyway tu put multiple values in the same selector without using a loop ?
[02:41:38] <Lucky--> http://www.cloudtweaks.com/2012/10/press-release-dreamhost-introduces-dreamcompute-public-cloud-computing-service/ shrug.
[02:41:38] <Cork> [attribute=value],[attribute=value],[attribute=value],[attribute=value],[attribute=value]
[02:42:08] <Cork> Asone: so ex $('input[attribute=value],input[attribute=value],input[attribute=value],input[attribute=value]')
[02:42:15] <Asone> will try it, thanks :)
[02:43:10] <Selfarian> Cork: Thank you very much. Now it seems to work. I think i have now some bugs in the coding and i need to find them ;)
[02:44:44] <Cork> Asone: or you could make it a little simplre to read if you have multiple elements with $('input, textarea').filter('$('[attribute=value],[attribute=value],[attribute=value]'))

[02:52:01] <pedda> hi there
[02:52:28] <pedda> i have a slideshow which is cycle2 based, and i use a fancybox on my page for displaying some html content
[02:53:10] <pedda> on pages where my slideshow is shown, my fancybox seems to collide with it, because the openeffect is "disturbed"
[02:53:45] <pedda> can you point me how to debug this behaviour ?
[02:57:47] <bradbrad> Guys, how can I adjust the speed of the fade transition in the JS file? Please please help! http://pastebin.com/AUW8dKnj
[02:59:14] <mazzachre> Is there some nice way to get the margins of an element in pixel? css('margin-top'); gives me a string ('10px' in my example) I would love to have just the number, 10...
[03:00:18] <MalMen> what is the diference between jquery and jquery.min ?
[03:00:27] <dblosevn> bradband:           var theTheImageSlider = new thetheImageSlider(); theImageslider.defaultInterval  = 800; theImageslider.defaultSlideT = 400;
[03:00:31] <RawProduce> MalMen: min is minified
[03:00:36] <RawProduce> no whitespace or comments
[03:02:49] <dblosevn> mazzachre parseInt($('selector').css('marginLeft'));
[03:05:00] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Oh thx... damned, start thinking mazzachre
[03:05:01] <dblosevn> mazzachre: parseInt will ignore the non numerics after the number
[03:05:17] <dblosevn> (y)
[03:05:34] <GeO`> hey gius
[03:05:36] <GeO`> guys :)
[03:05:46] <GeO`> I got a quick and easy question I hope...
[03:05:57] <GeO`> I want to reveal an image from right to left
[03:06:18] <GeO`> if it was from left to right I'd use width: 0px; and then animate() to width: 100%
[03:06:34] <GeO`> but from right to left I don't know how I can achieve that...any thoughts ?
[03:07:03] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Ya, I know that... I just didn't think of it :p
[03:07:26] <dblosevn> GeO`: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions
[03:07:42] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Been doing too much java programming where parseInt will throw if there are other than numbers...
[03:08:01] <GeO`> it's different from a slide dblosevn, my img is not supposed to move
[03:08:31] <dblosevn> mazzachre: believe me im running into that, going back and forth writing a php service for my java app
[03:09:13] <dblosevn> GeO`: halfway down the page it shows a rtl slide
[03:10:58] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Ya, I can imagine :o) Well, that is the way for us frontend devs
[03:11:38] <dblosevn> mazzachre: i suck at frontend, all i write really is backend lol, although i can make jquery bend over backwards and cry lol
[03:12:05] <dblosevn> mazzachre: jquery and extjs are by far the only 2 frontend frameworks I use
[03:12:48] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Ah ok.. Well I am mainly doing frontend work... But I get to do a lot of middleware too, currently in java
[03:13:50] <dblosevn> mazzachre: ya im learning java by building a CRM on android, consuming a php service
[03:14:23] <dblosevn> mazzachre: been years since I have dealt with a strongly typed language
[03:14:41] <abletony84> At this sticky header: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/ubSZw/ (scroll further down to see the effect) - how do I hide the header while it's not sticky?
[03:15:18] <noregret> anybody uses http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised ?
[03:16:52] <dblosevn> abletony84: add a class to it when its not stick and display:none
[03:17:11] <dblosevn> abletony84: display: block when sticky
[03:18:00] <dblosevn> or
[03:18:28] <dblosevn> abletony84: header { display:none; } header.sticky{display:block;}
[03:18:48] <dblosevn> thats probally the easiest way
[03:19:33] <abletony84> dblosevn: ah great, yeah that looks like a nice solution, many thanks!
[03:19:40] <dblosevn> (y)
[03:22:00] <Myx0x3> Why does this return "." when i spam space on my iphone? $(this).val($(this).val().replace(' ', '')); i know it isnt the best code, but the best thing i came up with :D
[03:23:23] <dblosevn> this.value = this.value.replace(' ', '');
[03:23:30] <dblosevn> will execute faster
[03:23:37] <Myx0x3> oh
[03:24:04] <angelazou> how can I tell a particular function to run again when the code is inside that function?
[03:24:05] <Myx0x3> it still sometimes gets an dot
[03:24:26] <Myx0x3> returns a dot maybe i should say
[03:24:27] <dblosevn> this.value = this.value.replace(/[\s]+/, '');
[03:25:03] <dblosevn> call it recursively
[03:25:08] <dblosevn> angelazou
[03:25:52] <dblosevn> function a (b) { //somecode d = a(c); return d; }
[03:27:09] <dblosevn> angelazou: http://javascript.about.com/library/blrecursive.htm
[03:27:17] <angelazou> well, I have this init function where if I met an error, I'd like to run it again
[03:27:35] <angelazou> so the code to run the function should be inside the function itself
[03:27:42] <angelazou> and it should run again
[03:28:09] <dblosevn> that will do that too just make sure you have an ohshit clause so it doesnt recurse infinitely and stack overflow
[03:28:32] <NodeX> "ohshit" clause... love it LOL
[03:29:47] <dblosevn> eg function init(errcount) { if (undefined !== errcount && errcount > 3) { return false; } somecode if (error) init(errcount++;);}
[03:29:54] <dblosevn> init()
[03:31:01] <UltraMC> Try clicking red circle here: http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/ - I do get contents but of all elements. How to get contents only of clicked parent?
[03:31:06] <dblosevn> also
[03:31:32] <dblosevn> when you recurse this perticuar function you might want to return imediately
[03:31:46] <dblosevn> eg... return init(errcount++; )
[03:31:54] <dblosevn> so it doesnt try to finish the init
[03:32:27] <dblosevn> then when you call it do something like if (init(0) !== false)
[03:32:58] <dblosevn> so you can handle for it if it does error out
[03:34:57] <adam_lynch> dblosevn: good idea!
[03:35:19] <adam_lynch> typically, no (I think) but I'd have to ask
[03:36:47] <Heather_> Im experiencing a problem where the src attribute of an image element stays the same after ajax request. The element is an "inner" element of another element that gets "replaced" replaced with .html() @callback function. The strange thing is that a new image is dispalyed but when I check the source code the name of the last image is dispalyed.
[03:39:40] <dblosevn> angelazou: and adam_lynch: heres a cleaner example easier to understand
[03:39:43] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/P0SewWAQ
[03:40:42] <UltraMC> How to get contents of first ancestor? Something like $(this).closest(".TITLE").contents()
[03:41:04] <dblosevn> oops this one lol http://pastebin.com/RnaGDJsi
[03:41:51] <dblosevn> $(this).parent().children('.TITLE').contents();
[03:42:13] <noregret> anybody uses jquery pagination http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised ?
[03:43:06] <UltraMC> dblosevn, I want to get content of this .TITLE element: http://pastebin.com/5Mkai3T1
[03:43:18] <UltraMC> and I am clicking on .USUN
[03:44:30] <NodeX> $(this).parents('.ELEMENT_LISTY NEW').find('.TITLE');
[03:44:58] <UltraMC> NodeX it returns [object Object]
[03:45:14] <NodeX> yes of course it does
[03:45:25] <NodeX> add .html() if you want the html
[03:45:39] <NodeX> text() if you want the plain text
[03:47:03] <UltraMC> NodeX, cool, why text() is working, contents() not?
[03:48:14] <abletony84> dblosevn: hold up - with display none / block, the sticky header begins showing immediately when scrolling down - whereas it should only display _after_ the h1 (i.e. where it's located physically): http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/ubSZw/2/
[03:48:36] <NodeX> because contents() is not what you think it is
[03:48:39] <NodeX> .contents()
[03:48:43] <NodeX> ?contents()
[03:48:44] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/

[03:52:40] <abletony84> wait let me rephrase
[03:53:05] <dblosevn> abletony84: this is gonna be good lol
[03:53:07] <abletony84> At this sticky header: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/ubSZw/2/ (scroll further down to see the effect) - how do I make the sticky header appear only after scrolling past the h1?
[03:53:25] <abletony84> dblosevn: well so-so

[03:55:07] <dblosevn> @ableton84:
[03:55:30] <abletony84> dblosevn: the sticky header should appear after the h1..
[03:55:45] <dblosevn> abletony84: just noticed that sec
[04:04:09] <dblosevn> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/ubSZw/4/
[04:06:06] <dblosevn> abletony84: or if you want it to consider the height of the h1 http://jsfiddle.net/ubSZw/5/
[04:06:43] <greg_f> Can I ask about twitter bootstrap here?
[04:07:24] <dblosevn> ? ask
[04:07:24] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:07:45] <abletony84> dblosevn: wow that is perfect
[04:07:51] <abletony84> thank you so much man :-)
[04:07:58] <dblosevn> abletony84: (y)
[04:08:16] <abletony84> im glad that pic of that worn down whore didnt scare you away from helping me
[04:08:26] <abletony84> hope you enjoy my novel =)
[04:08:40] <dblosevn> made me help you honestly im like damn i should hook this dude up lmao
[04:09:18] <abletony84> hehe
[04:10:43] <dblosevn> she kind of looks like she could be a dude though lmao
[04:10:58] <Selfarian> is it possible to use in the autocomplete source an path... e.g. "./path/to/suggest.php"?
[04:11:27] <abletony84> dblosevn: hehe
[04:11:44] <dblosevn> Selfarian: example please
[04:11:45] <abletony84> first image that came up when googling "charamuta" (meaning prostitute)
[04:12:11] <Selfarian> jQuery('#passnrsearch_1').autocomplete({source:'./custom_sites/includes/suggest_passnr.php', minLength:2});
[04:12:11] <abletony84> (and the name of my new novel)
[04:12:52] <abletony84> dblosevn: i could mention you in the novel. make you a character or something. as a way of showing my appreciation for your support..
[04:13:21] <abletony84> ive got a publisher and everything..
[04:13:42] <abletony84_> lemme know.. brb real quick

[04:15:40] <dblosevn> Selfarian: yes http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[04:17:03] <greg_f> I use twitter-bootstrap to show a modal window with tabs inside http://jsfiddle.net/WBwSW/ When I click on the second tab, all the window's content reload. Why it can be?
[04:18:30] <dblosevn> greg_f: wheres your javascript?
[04:20:06] <greg_f> dblosevn: to show a model window and tabs javcascript not needed (using bootstrap)
[04:27:40] <Selfarian> :/ i don't get it work :( http://pastebin.com/UPeFxUBd
[04:28:12] <Cork> Selfarian: please don't use dead pastebins
[04:28:35] <Cork> at least my head can't render js+css+html on the fly
[04:28:37] <Selfarian> dead pastebins?
[04:28:57] <Cork> ya, if the dump is meant to be of any use, use a live side like jsbin or jsfiddle
[04:29:07] <Cork> ?p
[04:29:07] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:30:07] <seutje> greg_f: bootstrap docs seem to disagree: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs
[04:32:07] <greg_f> seutje: I know, but it can works without js too. We use it few years...
[04:33:17] <seutje> well then you obviously have more knowledge about this than I do, so I doubt I'll be of any help
[04:34:16] <Selfarian> this way? http://jsfiddle.net/Selfarian/8S2rY/
[04:37:29] <Cork> uh, ya kinda
[04:37:42] <Cork> so what isn't working?
[04:38:32] <Selfarian> the important parts is the input-field with the id "passnrsearch_1" and at the end the few "<script>" lines. I tried to put the "suggest_passnr.php" in the same directory, i also tried to test this file by simply including it and it outputs json
[04:39:03] <Selfarian> the autocomplete of the "passnrsearch_1" field doesn't work.
[04:39:09] <dblosevn> greg_f: http://jsbin.com/uqozux/1/edit
[04:39:28] <dblosevn> It does work with no js just refuses to work in fiddle
[04:39:31] <Selfarian> the main goal would be to enable autocomplete for all "Paﬂnr"-fields
[04:39:54] <dblosevn> and he was missing data-role="dialog" in his dialog wrapper
[04:40:00] <Selfarian> but in the first step i try to get it working on only one field :-)
[04:40:40] <UltraMC> How to check if element has click event on it?
[04:40:54] <dblosevn> click it and pray?
[04:41:23] <UltraMC> how to do it with jQuery
[04:41:51] <dblosevn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236067/test-if-event-handler-is-bound-to-an-element-in-jquery
[04:41:57] <greg_f> dblosevn: thanks
[04:42:06] <dblosevn> greg_f: (y)
[04:42:52] <dblosevn> also twitters docs are wrong
[04:43:14] <Cork> Selfarian: didn't we talk about having form elements inside table elements?
[04:43:15] <dblosevn> it only had role="modal" when it should have been data-role="dialog"
[04:43:26] <Cork> Selfarian: i think we talked about that yesterday
[04:43:47] <Selfarian> no, it's my first day in the #jquery channel
[04:44:12] <seutje> Selfarian: http://jsfiddle.net/8S2rY/1/ works for me, only triggers after 3rd char and the source URL 404s, but other than that...
[04:44:21] <Cork> Selfarian: funny the same error was shown yesterdays :)
[04:44:24] <mazzachre> Is it me, or does console.log() in at least firefox no longer do anything on jsfiddle?
[04:44:45] <seutje> (had to add some libraries like jquery UI, thanks for that)
[04:44:46] <dblosevn> its you lol
[04:45:01] <Cork> seutje: actually html, head, body is invalid in the html section
[04:45:10] <dblosevn> mazzachre: I used console.log yesterday on fiddle
[04:45:16] <seutje> Cork: highly possible, still works for me
[04:45:38] <seutje> I'm not gonna clean up everything on this mess
[04:45:38] <Cork> seutje: true, you said works, not valid ;P
[04:45:49] <seutje> validity is overrated :P
[04:45:50] <Cork> that was me :D
[04:46:23] <Cork> Selfarian: <form> needs to be inside the <td> or outside the table
[04:46:32] <Cork> Selfarian: it can't be between table and td
[04:47:02] <Cork> browsers will error correct and move the form tag
[04:47:12] <Cork> that means that none of the input elements are inside the form
[04:48:17] <Cork> <form target="_blank" method="post" action="../custom_sites/send-data.php"></form><table>...
[04:48:53] <dblosevn> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/35SDK/ Logs hello on load
[04:49:09] <Cork> Selfarian: btw when your at it; you should prob change doctype too
[04:49:30] <Cork> Selfarian: <!doctype html> is all you need
[04:49:37] <Already> How would i check if an element is currently visible for the user?
[04:49:53] <Cork> Already: thats very complicated
[04:50:12] <Cork> you have to calculate its x, y positions on the page
[04:50:30] <Cork> and check the scroll positions and height/width of the viewport
[04:50:34] <dblosevn> Already: $('selector').is(':visible');
[04:50:44] <Cork> thats not the same thing
[04:50:56] <Cork> that only checks if its display: none;
[04:50:57] <Already> Oh i don't want to check whenever or not it's in the viewport. Just whenever or not slideDown/slideUp was called the last time.
[04:51:02] <Cork> or visibility: hidden;
[04:51:05] <Selfarian> Cork: ok, i put the <form> tags outside the table: http://jsfiddle.net/Selfarian/8S2rY/2/
[04:51:30] <dblosevn> visible on the viewport is not what i was going for
[04:51:31] <Already> Might be just the thing i want to do. Maybe my phrasing was just bad. :)
[04:51:53] <Already> But Cork i think.
[04:52:00] <Already> Thanks dblosevn
[04:52:35] <dblosevn> (y)
[04:52:53] <Cork> dblosevn: what do you mean with (y) ?
[04:53:03] <dblosevn> thumbs up
[04:53:13] <shoky> IRC!=MSN ;p
[04:53:23] <dblosevn> lmao
[04:53:33] <dblosevn> i get the emot on my client
[04:53:37] <seutje> that always looks like a women's loins to me
[04:53:39] <Selfarian> seutje: how did you test it? i don't even get an error :(
[04:54:13] <seutje> Selfarian: I typed 3 characters in the field in question and monitored my network traffic to see if the XHR popped up, and it did
[04:54:16] <mazzachre> dblosevn: Then it is my system...
[04:54:41] <dblosevn> mazzachre: gotta be I just tested in firefox and chrome
[04:55:04] <dblosevn> mazzachre: sometimes firebug hangs, try restarting your browser
[04:55:53] <dblosevn> mazzachre: I usually break it refreshing a page while the debugger is stopped it doesnt act right after that
[04:56:10] <seutje> mazzachre: native dev tools will always be superior
[04:56:32] <seutje> at least they don't inject a div in between the head and the body >:|
[04:58:06] <mazzachre> Last time I used chrome breakpoints did nothing...
[04:58:15] <Cork> seutje: your example would die silently in most browsers as your trying to do cross domain ajax
[04:58:32] <seutje> Cork: yeah, I didn't change the URL
[04:58:32] <dblosevn> mazzachre: I mainly use the chrome inspector now much more stable then firebug
[04:58:44] <seutje> like I said, not fixing all of this mess, just enough to see if it works
[04:59:15] <dblosevn> mazzachre: I have yet to break it lol
[04:59:19] <seutje> which I think I did, as I can see it attempts to do xdomain XHR and it throws a security violation for it
[05:02:03] <Cork> ya i see it in chrome, but not in firefox for some reason
[05:02:14] <Cork> can't really find why though
[05:03:06] <Cork> Selfarian: you might want to run your page through w3c's validator
[05:03:13] <Cork> that might make things work better
[05:03:16] <dominikd> is there a way i can cockblock a deferred's .done handlers from executing?
[05:03:38] <Cork> cockblock??
[05:03:49] <Cork> not even sure i want to know what that is....
[05:03:54] <dblosevn> lmao
[05:03:56] <dominikd> essentially deferred.doNotExecuteAnyCallbacksUponDone
[05:04:00] <TheBrayn> hinder a male chicken
[05:04:16] <Cork> lol
[05:04:32] <dblosevn> stop ones friend who happens to be a girl from being approached by guys lmao (cockblock)
[05:04:53] <seutje> Cork: yeah, that's prolly a discrepancy in how chrome and FF fix broken markup
[05:04:53] <Cork> dominikd: deffered.disable()
[05:05:07] <Myx0x3> how do i make onkeyup only acceppt my regexp?
[05:05:27] <dominikd> Cork, you mean abort?
[05:05:31] <Myx0x3> and remove chars that dont match my regexp
[05:05:31] <dominikd> i cant find .disable
[05:05:49] <dominikd> afaik abort kills the request, i want to clear out any existing callbacks and attach my own
[05:05:57] <seutje> Myx0x3: you mean limit the characters they can input?
[05:06:19] <Cork> bleh, deferred doesn't inherid the disable function -_-'
[05:06:19] <Myx0x3> seutje: yeah, i think html5 has it, but the support is bad.. :/
[05:06:25] <Myx0x3> for inputs
[05:06:28] <seutje> coz onkeyup is a property, it doesn't "accept" anything
[05:06:35] <seutje> ?g jquery mask & Myx0x3
[05:06:37] <bot-t> seutje, No results found for 'jquery mask & Myx0x3'.
[05:06:45] <seutje> bot-t: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT
[05:06:45] <bot-t> seutje, My reply is no.
[05:07:12] <Myx0x3> haha
[05:07:13] <Myx0x3> http://www.w3schools.com/html5/att_input_pattern.asp
[05:07:15] <seutje> Myx0x3: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[05:07:37] <dominikd> ah i thought of another way to solve it
[05:07:40] <dominikd> thanks anway Columcille
[05:07:42] <dominikd> Cork,
[05:08:08] <Cork> dominikd: you might want to check callbacks see ?.callbacks.disable
[05:08:11] <bot-t> dominikd, callbacks.disable() - Disable a callback list from doing anything more. http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.disable/
[05:08:31] <seutje> Myx0x3: I don't know of any working input pattern polyfill
[05:08:37] <dominikd> i can just change the callbacks to check if they should execute
[05:08:43] <dominikd> dont have to fuck with deferred after the fact
[05:08:56] <Selfarian> cork: i think, i can fix some of this errors, but many are caused by the cms it self
[05:08:58] <Selfarian> :)
[05:09:09] <Cork> ya, i know
[05:09:16] <Cork> cms systems often have those problems
[05:09:21] <Already> Would anyone happen to know a good way to test if a site works on mobile devices without having one to actually test it?
[05:09:32] <Cork> i've had to sit and fix crapy html my self
[05:09:34] <dominikd> Already, resize your browser
[05:09:45] <Cork> luckely thats a thing in the past for me :)
[05:09:52] <seutje> Myx0x3: oh wait, here we go: http://ericleads.com/h5validate/
[05:10:04] <Cork> dominikd: thats actually not enough
[05:10:16] <Cork> Already: android has emulators you can test with
[05:10:25] <platzhirsch1> How can I check whether a DOM element contains text or structured, semi-structured content?
[05:10:39] <noregret> anybody uses jquery pagination http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised ?
[05:10:40] <Cork> iphone demands that you have a mac, if you do you can use xcode
[05:10:49] <Already> Right i read about that once for app-developers. Thanks Cork i totally forgot about it!
[05:11:37] <Already> Android might be sufficient. I just want to check it out and most of "our" people have android anyway as far as i can tell.
[05:11:47] <seutje> platzhirsch1: what's semi-structured content?
[05:11:56] <Cork> you definitely don't want to test with the desktop browser if your using fixed or elements with scrollbars and things like that
[05:12:02] <Cork> cause that WILL differ on mobile
[05:12:08] <platzhirsch1> seutje: oh actually I mean structured content only, that means further DOM elements
[05:12:41] <platzhirsch1> seutje: semi-structured content I something like: "Hello there<p>My name is blah blah</p> ok?"
[05:12:46] <Cork> (differ as in break)
[05:12:48] <seutje> platzhirsch1: well, if it has children, it's got DOM nodes
[05:13:04] <platzhirsch1> seutje: ah that's sufficient, thanks for the hint :)
[05:13:08] <seutje> (other than text nodes)
[05:13:12] <platzhirsch1> I am a bit slow today
[05:13:20] <Already> That's what i was thinking about Cork so thanks for the hint.
[05:13:23] <seutje> fairly certain text nodes don't show up when using children
[05:13:30] <AdamPDotty> like children().length
[05:13:40] <Nargus> platzhirsch1, you may compare .text().length and .html().length of your element
[05:16:32] <seutje> platzhirsch1: http://jsfiddle.net/dcz4Z/
[05:17:03] <seutje> it's not 100% bulletproof, but otherwise you'd have to iterate over all childnodes and check if they are textnodes and shit
[05:17:24] <AdamPDotty> you are too kind seutje
[05:17:27] <platzhirsch1> seutje: yes, that's really great
[05:17:36] <Selfarian> cork: ok, now i firstly try to get this thing working with a simple test-file without cms
[05:17:41] <Selfarian> maybe i get this running :D
[05:17:57] <Selfarian> and if i get it running, i'll try to integrate it... maybe this will work ;)
[05:18:02] <platzhirsch1> seutje: well it will do for the little hack I am writing, just getting my demo application ready
[05:19:12] <seutje> Nargus: doesn't html include comments?
[05:20:21] <Cork> it should
[05:20:34] <platzhirsch1> I just noticed, that for what I want to achieve I always only need to call $(ele).text(). This happens if you do not state exactly what you want to achieve, but your intermediate solution
[05:21:30] <seutje> Nargus: yeah... http://jsfiddle.net/dcz4Z/1/
[05:22:11] <Nargus> seutje: you are right, it was not a good way)
[05:23:14] <seutje> well thanks for making me think about it, would never have considered to keep that in mind otherwise :x
[05:36:40] <mazzachre> Oh god dammit... The error I was trying to find using console.log() is not there in chrome... Or IE for that matter... only in firefox... sigh
[05:37:04] <Cork> mazzachre: what error is it your looking for?
[05:39:04] <mazzachre> Well, it is sort of complex... I have a custom tooltip plugin I am working on.. If the tooltip shows on top of an element that also have tooltipaction and I move the mouse over the tooltip to the position of the other element it is not updated to point to the new element and will start blinking with show on the old element instead of on the new element.. and I can't quite find where the reference is not updated...
[05:39:12] <mazzachre> Seems like mousemove is a little buggy...
[05:40:07] <Cork> sounds like your hover areas ends up slightly ontop of eachother
[05:40:42] <mazzachre> I am using mouseenter and mouseleave (as I do other stuff than just initiate a show)
[05:41:10] <Cork> btw about the console.log problem
[05:41:17] <mazzachre> ya
[05:41:22] <Cork> have you checked if it ends up in firefox built in console?
[05:41:33] <mazzachre> Uhm no...
[05:41:37] <Cork> i've had that problem from time to time when firefox snags it
[05:41:41] <Cork> ctrl+shift+k
[05:42:04] <mazzachre> it does
[05:42:06] <mazzachre> thx
[05:42:12] <Cork> np
[05:43:30] <Nargus> mazzachre: may be not mousemove makes troubles but mouseover/mouseout you use? try hover instead of they. it's more stable. I have never faced problems with mousemove
[05:43:31] <Selfarian> ok... could you tell me, if there is something missing: http://skc-lohhof.de/custom_sites/autocomplete.php
[05:43:32] <Selfarian> ?
[05:44:08] <mazzachre> Hmm... ok, that explained something.. The position is not recalculated correctly...
[05:44:29] <Cork> Selfarian: the doctype to start with, you don't want to run in quirks mode
[05:44:52] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[05:45:22] <Cork> (browsers will try to emulate old ie browsers in that mode)
[05:45:53] <Cork> Selfarian: apart from that, it works for me
[05:45:54] <Selfarian> ah ok
[05:45:56] <Selfarian> i added it
[05:46:11] <Selfarian> do you get an autocomplete-popup?
[05:46:27] <Selfarian> or do you mean the sourcecode?
[05:46:44] <Cork> it connects to http://skc-lohhof.de/custom_sites/suggest_passnr.php?term=ads and gets 404
[05:47:00] <Cork> so no no popup, but thats not client side problems :)
[05:47:50] <Nargus> Selfarian: Try to wrap your JS in document ready function:  $(function(){  ...code_here...  });
[05:48:44] <Cork> Nargus: pointless if you have it in body
[05:48:56] <Cork> Nargus: you only need it if its in head
[05:49:13] <Cork> in body it will just hide problems in ie (you don't see it in other browsers)
[05:49:59] <Selfarian> cork: could you tell me, what i need to get this error, what you got? ;)
[05:50:05] <Selfarian> is it sth like firebug?
[05:50:25] <Cork> yes
[05:50:35] <Cork> look in the console or the network tab
[05:51:16] <Cork> hmm now i get a 500 error so something has changed
[05:51:50] <Selfarian> ah
[05:51:51] <Selfarian> cool
[05:51:53] <Selfarian> yes :)
[05:52:16] <kzrdt> hi, I've got a string containing 2 instances of a pattern, I want to replace the first instance with something and the second with something else, what is the best way to accomplish that?
[05:53:37] <dblosevn> var mystring = 'hi test some more test test'.replace(/test/, 'doug').replace(/test/, 'dave');
[05:54:23] <dblosevn> String.replace only replaces one instance unless you use the /g modifier
[05:55:26] <dblosevn> mystring would be 'hi doug some more dave test'; after running that
[05:58:01] <earthw0rm> I'm trying to work out JQuery Tag-It autocomplete, and returning a tag name as well as what DB table it came from
[05:58:24] <earthw0rm> The JSON autocomplete stuff it uses only returns a flat array
[05:58:46] <earthw0rm> I probably need to return a key/value map, tablename/match
[05:58:57] <earthw0rm> Is this going to be a big job?
[06:04:31] <Selfarian> cork: so i "only" need to find out, why i get an 500... :/
[06:04:47] <Cork> lol check the webserver logs
[06:05:04] <Cork> the error log should have it stated
[06:05:07] <pachet> slay a calf and examine the entrails
[06:05:16] <kzrdt> dblosevn: thanks a lot, I check that
[06:05:36] <Tobsn> anyone an idea how i can check if a specific dialog is visible created within jq mobile?
[06:06:01] <Tobsn> maybe theres an event i can bind to the div of the dialog
[06:07:02] <greg_f> Some times ago I wrote about the modal window with tabs inside. The problem is in $('#myModal').on('shown', function(){ $('#myModal .modal-body').load('/path/'); }); Clicking on the tab it gets method 'shown' and reload page.
[06:07:23] <Selfarian> ah... i'm stupid ;)
[06:08:29] <pachet> Tobsn: $('#dialog').on('pageshow', function(){ /* stuff */ })
[06:08:44] <Tobsn> aaah, merci ;)
[06:08:48] <seutje> greg_f: pass e to your handler and e.preventDefault() it inside the handler
[06:09:19] <seutje> like function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#myModal .modal-body).load(...); }
[06:10:03] <Tobsn> pachet, maybe you also got an idea how to interfere before the transition that opens the dialog? i have normal page here and a button opens up the dialog but i want to show a loadingmessage() for 1-2 sec and then open up the dialog
[06:11:25] <greg_f> seutje: thanks, but it did't help.
[06:12:04] <seutje> greg_f: oh wait, my bad, it's not even a click handler lol
[06:13:14] <pachet> Tobsn: you'd have to bind to the click event on the button, show your load msg, then manually invoke the dialog via $.mobile.changePage(id, {role:'dialog'})
[06:13:43] <Tobsn> ah yes, that makes a lot more sense than fucking around in between
[06:13:45] <Tobsn> thanks :)
[06:14:01] <Selfarian> cork: it works!!!!!!!!!!! oO
[06:14:07] <Cork> heh
[06:14:19] <Tobsn> is there anything mobile browser safe i should set the <a href="" too that would invoke the event for the load and pagechange?
[06:14:27] <Tobsn> *to
[06:15:56] <pachet> erm not sure
[06:16:03] <Tobsn> k, i'll just try #
[06:16:15] <Tobsn> which is weird because i removed the #popup from the href and now its still opening the dialog
[06:16:18] <Tobsn> very odd.
[06:16:59] <Tobsn> ah no, my fault
[06:17:32] <Selfarian> the problem was: i included the config file from the joomla system into the suggest-script... and in the config file was a class, which i tried to initialize... i don't know why, but the include didn't work... so... this 500-error happened :)
[06:18:55] <Gx4> hi
[06:19:05] <TheBrayn> how do I search an element which has a certain subelement?
[06:19:27] <pachet> TheBrayn: search *for* an element with a specific child? and you know the child?
[06:19:28] <Selfarian> one question again: so ... as you maybe remember, i have about 16 fields, wich should be auto-completed by the same function. Do i need to set a unique id to each field and add a function for each feld, or is it possible to set one function/id for all fields?
[06:19:35] <pachet> or, search for any element that has a child matching a selector?
[06:19:54] <TheBrayn> pachet: yes
[06:20:02] <TheBrayn> the first one
[06:20:11] <dblosevn> id match on [name=attribute]
[06:20:35] <pachet> TheBrayn: walk up the child's ancestors until you find what you're looking for
[06:20:46] <TheBrayn> hm good idea
[06:21:15] <Tobsn> theres actually a function for that
[06:21:19] <Tobsn> cant remember, had to do that once
[06:21:51] <pachet> oh im sorry, this is jquery
[06:21:54] <pachet> thought i was in #js
[06:22:03] <pachet> TheBrayn: $('#foo').closest('.bar')
[06:22:08] <TheBrayn> thanks
[06:24:53] <mazzachre> heh... my workaround solved another problem that had been raised earlier and deemed too difficult to solve... lol
[06:25:02] <mori57> Hallo. Any jQuery-core devs around?
[06:25:17] <lathan> ?question @ mori57
[06:25:19] <bot-t> mori57, $('<select class="question" />'); vs $('<select ... - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12002
[06:25:23] <lathan> ?ask
[06:25:24] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:25:30] <lathan> mori57, ^
[06:26:48] <Deepak> what is jquery?
[06:26:56] <mori57> Sry. Ok, this is in regard to a question that came up on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12954909/jquery-attr-method-can-set-click-handler-and-inner-text Looking at the documentation, I ran some test cases, and I'm hitting unexpected results, according to the way .attr() is supposed to work when you use a function as the second param.
[06:27:17] <anli> Deepak: a set of functions making dom manipulation much easier
[06:27:18] <pachet> Deepak: its a firefox plugin that makes all web pages run faster
[06:27:22] <anli> haha
[06:27:32] <anli> ajax is a lot easier as well
[06:27:34] <lathan> pachet, Deepak it is not a FF plugin.
[06:27:41] <dblosevn> lmao
[06:27:43] <anli> :)
[06:27:44] <xckpd7> question: http://pastie.org/5075317 <-- how can I use proxy but still in some format retain the value of this?
[06:27:45] <mori57> I was wondering if it was my misunderstanding of the documentation, or if the documentation needs to be clarified, or if there's an actual bug to report.
[06:27:50] <dblosevn> i thought it was an IE replacement
[06:27:57] <anli> I wish
[06:28:01] <pachet> it also makes web sarcasm a lot easier to detect
[06:28:05] <anli> Anything can be a good IE replacement
[06:28:06] <lathan> pachet, jQuery is a javascript Framework for querying, manipulating the DOM
[06:28:09] <pachet> sarcastic comments will blink in green text
[06:28:12] <dblosevn> http://jquery.com/
[06:28:23] <anli> My asshole is a good IE replacement
[06:28:29] <lathan> pachet, with jQuery I can take a javascript function 20-30 lines long and turn it into 2-5 lines
[06:28:36] <lathan> anli, can we watch the language?
[06:28:36] <dblosevn> it be worn out better not toss it around
[06:28:42] <anli> lathan: sorry
[06:28:47] <anli> I will not say IE from now on
[06:28:51] <lathan> LOL
[06:28:54] <anli> ;)
[06:29:01] <lathan> does that mean IE10 is a four letter word?
[06:29:22] <dblosevn> IE10 has suprised me so far, its actually dare I say fast
[06:29:32] <anli> Does it understand text-shadow?
[06:29:35] <lathan> dblosevn, well, IE isn't getting worse...
[06:29:42] <anli> Sorry, it was a joke
[06:29:47] <anli> An evil one
[06:29:48] <lathan> they just still haven't fixed their overabundance on cache
[06:29:55] <dblosevn> and doesnt seem to have the orphaned , problem with json
[06:30:11] <lathan> http://caniuse.com/css-textshadow
[06:30:22] <anli> If I had a lot of money I would buy that project and cancel it
[06:30:37] <lathan> anli, which?
[06:30:48] <anli> lathan: The unspeakable from now on one
[06:30:50] <dblosevn> i still dont use it however just when a site requires IE
[06:30:57] <lathan> anli, lol

[06:32:57] <lathan> NodeX, do you know how to get bot-t to show the full syntax signature?
[06:33:10] <lathan> : ?on vs ?on#sig (or something)
[06:33:39] <lathan> ajpiano, what was the bot-t syntax to get the full method signature, ?on#sig

[06:34:17] <greg_f> seutje: I made via durty hack like ie.relatedTargetf (e.relatedTarget == undefined) { ... }
[06:35:15] <dblosevn> if (isIS )  browser.close();
[06:35:28] <dblosevn> isIE
[06:35:44] <lathan> ?browser @ dblosevn
[06:35:44] <scar> heh if isIS

[06:36:06] <lathan> ?support

[06:36:44] <lathan> $.browser.msie = (true|false)
[06:37:01] <dblosevn> well i guess i should stopp beating off and goto work lol
[06:37:15] <lathan> if($.browser.msie) alert('The sky is falling') && window.location.url = 'about:blank'
[06:37:59] <Selfarian> thanks to you all for your help! bye
[06:38:09] <Cork> msie is a bit hard don't you think?
[06:39:11] <Cork> basing error fixes on the ua string is a really bad idea
[06:39:13] <lathan> Cork, yes. in all aspects.
[06:39:35] <lathan> Cork, that is why jQuery officially suggests using $.support
[06:39:39] <Cork> and should only be used as a absolute last resource, cause that expects that the browser never fixes it
[06:39:41] <lathan> where it actually tests for the bugs
[06:39:45] <Cork> ya
[06:39:47] <lathan> rather than assumes
[06:39:52] <Cork> its much, much MUCH better
[06:39:52] <lathan> but for fun jokes....
[06:41:01] <UltraMC_2> How to check if element has event (ex. click)?
[06:41:26] <lathan> UltraMC_2, .data('events')
[06:41:46] <lathan> that will have an object with the key being the event_type and the value an array of handler functions
[06:41:57] <dblosevn> UltraMC_2: I told you that earlier
[06:42:06] <UltraMC_2> lathan how to check if div with class .CLASS has click event on it?
[06:42:22] <UltraMC_2> $(".CLASS").data('click') ?
[06:42:37] <lathan> $('div.class').data('events').click
[06:42:38] <pachet> '.CLASS' is a terrible label for a class  :[
[06:42:47] <UltraMC_2> pachet, ...
[06:42:52] <dblosevn> lol
[06:42:53] <lathan> pachet, its just a placeholder
[06:42:57] <UltraMC_2> lathan, returns true or false, right?
[06:43:01] <lathan> no
[06:43:06] <lathan> UltraMC_2, did you read my first post to you?
[06:43:17] <UltraMC_2> yeah but I understand nothing :)
[06:43:23] <lathan> that will have an object with the key being the event_type and the value an array of handler functions
[06:43:43] <lathan> .data('events') == { 'click' : [func, func, func, ...], 'mouseover': [func, ...] }
[06:43:57] <lathan> so if there is a click and the array isn't empty then there are bound events
[06:44:28] <lathan> UltraMC_2, but be careful because unless you have saved the function that was bound to the click event you won't be able to tell if someone else bound their own function
[06:45:05] <UltraMC_2> lathan, what do you mean?
[06:45:19] <lathan> UltraMC_2, if you have 2 different functions that you bind to click
[06:45:30] <lathan> it could be difficult to distinguish which function is there
[06:45:30] <dblosevn> var ev = $('.class').data('events').click; if (undefined !== ev && ev.length) { } else { }
[06:46:30] <sahbeewah> you shouldn't be checking if there are events on an elements
[06:46:32] <sahbeewah> that's terrible
[06:46:36] <pachet> it is terrible
[06:46:50] <sahbeewah> also that won't check for delegates
[06:46:54] <pachet> and it doesnt work the same in 1.8
[06:46:57] <dblosevn> you honestly should know if there are events on the elements lol
[06:46:57] <sahbeewah> and .data('events') is deprecated
[06:47:04] <pachet> 1.7 you might be able to squeak by
[06:47:17] <UltraMC_2> sahbeewah, I am attaching events to every element that was created from AJAX call. I select them by class, so previous elements have event hooked again and again
[06:47:23] <UltraMC_2> wanna help with this one?
[06:47:28] <lathan> hm....
[06:47:32] <lathan> the data isn't getting set
[06:47:36] <Cork> UltraMC_2: just use delegated event listeners
[06:47:48] <UltraMC_2> Cork oh hi Cork! Delegated?
[06:48:03] <pachet> just assign the handlers to elements within a specific context
[06:48:05] <naquad> did some try to extend tablesorter with own filter?
[06:48:06] <lathan> UltraMC_2, add a class called "alreadyProcessed"
[06:48:09] <pachet> so you know you're only touching the ones you just got back
[06:48:16] <pachet> and then throw them in the mix afterwards
[06:48:17] <Cork> yes set one event listener for all the elements and then just handle them all with one listener
[06:48:23] <lathan> ?live
[06:48:23] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:48:27] <lathan> ?on#live
[06:48:28] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:48:38] <lathan> ?event delegation
[06:48:39] <bot-t> lathan, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:48:41] <UltraMC_2> lathan what was selector for tag that has NO given class?
[06:48:51] <lathan> oi...all these old methods
[06:48:58] <Cork> UltraMC_2: just add a class to them
[06:49:04] <lathan> ?tag-selector
[06:49:14] <dblosevn> $new = $(reponse.html); $new('*').click(function() { }); $parent.append($new);
[06:49:18] <Cork> UltraMC_2: you always want to select for things that exist, not what doesn't exist
[06:49:46] <lathan> ?element selector @ UltraMC_2
[06:49:52] <Cork> uh... $new('*') ?? :D
[06:49:55] <Cork> no that doesn't work
[06:49:57] <dblosevn> lol
[06:50:00] <lathan> ?element-selector
[06:50:05] <dblosevn> was just saying lol
[06:50:17] <pachet> good lord, some messy snippets in here this morning
[06:50:23] <lathan> bot isn't working, but UltraMC_2: http://api.jquery.com/element-selector/
[06:50:32] <UltraMC_2> Why when I click on first ( - ) on top dialog is cool, but all above have different height? http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/
[06:50:49] <dblosevn> well should have been $new.find
[06:51:05] <dblosevn> I didnt know what elements he wanted to bind too
[06:51:29] <dblosevn> best way would be to bind before appending them though
[06:51:56] <UltraMC_2> dblosevn, see function ajax_dodaj http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/js.js
[06:53:12] <dblosevn> UltraMC_2: attach your listeners before $("#listaElementow").prepend(data);
[06:54:31] <dblosevn> data is a jquery object so you can do something like data.find('a.class').click(function() { } );
[06:54:42] <UltraMC_2> dblosevn can you do jsfiddle.net , please?
[06:54:57] <dblosevn> I have no clue what is in response
[06:55:26] <dblosevn> can you give me an example response?
[06:56:00] <lathan> ?jsfiddle
[06:56:01] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:56:26] <dblosevn> i know what jsfiddle is...i dont know what his ajax response looks like
[06:57:17] <lathan> I was partially showing UltraMC_2 how to bot that
[06:57:18] <UltraMC_2> dblosevn, response: http://pastebin.com/wnyKEf5u
[06:57:36] <lathan> UltraMC_2, why all the capslock?
[06:57:42] <UltraMC_2> but UltraMC_2 got no cluea what you are trying to teach
[06:57:45] <lathan> UltraMC_2, that was standard like 15-30 years ago
[06:57:49] <UltraMC_2> lathan, .CLASS #id
[06:57:53] <UltraMC_2> its my style
[06:58:09] <lathan> UltraMC_2, you can use our bot: bot-t to run certain comands.

[06:59:58] <dblosevn> http://pastebin.com/64U8yaak
[07:00:32] <UltraMC_2> hmmm
[07:01:17] <dblosevn> simply find the selector your looking for in data and attach your listener then prepend the list
[07:01:58] <lathan> the order of binding the event and prepending the list shouldn't matter if you are delegating...
[07:02:05] <dblosevn> ya
[07:02:12] <UltraMC_2> dblosevn, whats the difference?
[07:02:17] <dblosevn> as long as you still have a refernce to the dom element your prepending
[07:02:28] <dblosevn> it doesnt matter when you do it
[07:02:57] <dblosevn> I prefer to do it before I add it to the dom though so its clear what im doing
[07:03:38] <lathan> dblosevn, all preference
[07:03:38] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com  the town select on the form top right I  have had reports that people cant scroll or when they click on the scroll bar the select closes again.. Any ideas on how it can be resolved?
[07:03:49] <dblosevn> lathan: indeed
[07:03:52] <lathan> I usually prefer after
[07:05:33] <UltraMC_2> Why when I click on first red button on top dialog is cool, but all above have different height? http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/jquery/
[07:05:48] <dblosevn> djsounds02: confirmed broken in chrome
[07:06:47] <djsounds02> reports are from ie :(
[07:06:56] <djsounds02> that only makes it worse though
[07:07:23] <dblosevn> djsounds02: confirmed broken in IE10
[07:07:51] <dblosevn> safari pc as well
[07:08:01] <dblosevn> firefox is the only browser it works in
[07:08:02] <djsounds02> dblosevn: haha ok I think its broke!
[07:08:23] <djsounds02> yeah ff is my browser haha.. works for me!
[07:08:48] <dblosevn> maybe put a mask over the scrollbar
[07:08:52] <dblosevn> well
[07:09:02] <dblosevn> no, you wouldnt be able to scroll lol i need sleep
[07:09:15] <djsounds02> lol
[07:10:36] <dblosevn> target the click event to the li's instead of the UL

[07:18:07] <FernandoBasso> How to check if an ul with a given id exists in a document? I am trying this: "if (jQuery('ul#estado_pais_'+id_pais)) {..." but it is always true, even though I don't have #estados_pais_2 to 4.
[07:18:26] <NodeX> size()
[07:18:42] <NodeX> if(jQuery('foo').size()....
[07:19:36] <FernandoBasso> > 0?
[07:19:41] <ryanneufeld> NodeX: you mean length
[07:19:47] <ryanneufeld> FernandoBasso: see ?length
[07:19:47] <bot-t> FernandoBasso, length: The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
[07:19:49] <RawProduce> FernandoBasso: $(ul#id).length, I believe
[07:20:04] <ryanneufeld> ?size
[07:20:04] <bot-t> .size(): Return the number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[07:20:13] <ryanneufeld> synonyms
[07:21:26] <brettster> Hey guys.
[07:21:31] <FernandoBasso> Thanks.
[07:21:34] <ryanneufeld> though I would length though, since all size does is return this.length
[07:21:38] <lathan> .length == .size()
[07:21:42] <brettster> Im just curious - can I get by learning jQuery without learning JS.
[07:21:50] <lathan> brettster, no
[07:22:01] <lathan> brettster, jQuery is just an upgrade to javascript
[07:22:03] <pachet> you definitely can
[07:22:05] <brettster> well
[07:22:06] <lathan> its all still javascript
[07:22:08] <brettster> a framework
[07:22:12] <pachet> in the same sense that you can get by without getting your gangrene leg checked out
[07:22:18] <lathan> lol
[07:22:25] <brettster> but what I'm asking is can i learn query and still learn javascript in the process
[07:22:25] <quicksilver> it would be like learning french poetry without learning french.
[07:22:31] <brettster> or do i need to learn one before the other
[07:22:32] <ryanneufeld> brettster: you can't, cause jquery is js
[07:22:35] <quicksilver> you can learn that at the same time, sure
[07:22:42] <quicksilver> but javascript is a simple language anyhow
[07:22:44] <ryanneufeld> brettster: yes you can learn both at the same time
[07:23:02] <dblosevn> jquery takes all the real work out of it for you so it could actually be easier to learn jquery to learn js
[07:23:34] <ryanneufeld> jquery can lower the barrier of entry to learning js, it does a lot of things for you, and covers you from some of the gotchas of js
[07:23:47] <pachet> not knowing the underlying javascript is going to hurt your hireability
[07:24:16] <mazzachre> How to get border-radius attribute from css?
[07:24:17] <Chris_CC> Hi guys .. I'm using ajax to submit a form so that i don;t have to reload the page .. and i see that function(data) returns the pages data .. but HOW do i set that data specifically?
[07:24:32] <pachet> or i guess if you're an optimistic person you can say that knowing the underlying javascript will dramatically improve your hireability
[07:24:37] <dblosevn> .css('border-radius')
[07:24:48] <lathan> dblosevn, but what about the webkit and moz versions?
[07:25:08] <dblosevn> youd have to test for all of them
[07:25:10] <brettster> I know enough about js to use it.
[07:25:20] <lathan> brettster, it is an important lesson to know how vanilla javascript works in order to know what jQuery is doign for you, and how to watch out for things that would take a while
[07:25:22] <brettster> but i know I'm messy with it.
[07:25:33] <lathan> brettster, then you can learn jQuery and you will grow in JS knowledge...
[07:25:35] <brettster> really messy
[07:25:41] <lathan> lol
[07:26:00] <brettster> like i can code a pretty advanced website using 400 - 500 lines of css.
[07:26:13] <lathan> *cringe*
[07:26:20] <dblosevn> lathan: or browser test and determine which one to test for
[07:26:21] <brettster> but I'm awful at making my js reusable
[07:26:26] <lathan> please don't use code to refer to css :( lol

[07:36:53] <wfq> hi guys
[07:37:10] <wfq> what is the simplest yet effective jquery-based captcha that I should be using plesae?
[07:37:42] <hlve> recaptcha
[07:37:48] <hlve> no further questions
[07:39:39] <lathan> captcha's are more server based than javascript, so jQuery realy isn't helpful
[07:40:36] <wfq> lathan, I know but I was trying to find something easy to do.
[07:41:04] <wfq> although bots could easily disable javascript I can guess on a browser-like app
[07:42:19] <lathan> wfq, bots download the html, and don't run javascript
[07:42:24] <lathan> usually
[07:43:08] <lathan> but the creator of the bot could figure out what your form needs to post and then just make the request that looks just like the form. hence the need for captcha, so the form has to change every time
[07:44:36] <wfq> lathan, so basically anything that is not server-side won't be good as the javascript is a validation layer that bots will surpass easily
[07:44:39] <anli> I have set max-height on a div to 800px, it has height 295px but does still show scrollbars (scroll: auto)
[07:46:12] <Jon47> anli:	max-height means the element won't exceed that height
[07:46:22] <Jon47> it doens't guarantee it will be that tall, only that it will not be taller
[07:46:46] <Jon47> def not a jquery question though ;)
[07:48:37] <lathan> but jQuery has a habbit of interferring with all aspects of html and css...
[07:49:01] <juboba> hello
[07:49:17] <lathan> ?hi
[07:49:17] <bot-t> Hey lathan
[07:49:28] <lathan> ?hi @ juboba
[07:49:28] <bot-t> Hey juboba
[07:49:46] <juboba> I want to bind a jeditable to some elements in my page that are generated dynamically, how should I do this?
[07:50:10] <juboba> $('.editable').editable(); works only for the elements that already exist
[07:50:33] <lathan> juboba, then you need some way to run that .editable on the elements on some event of when they are added
[07:51:52] <juboba> good idea
[07:52:01] <juboba> delegate would run on all elements again
[07:53:50] <RedFyre> what happened to the "Getting started" guide linked from the support page? http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started
[07:56:12] <lathan> juboba, what you do is you use a class to indicate that this element needs to have it run (and then remove the class), or add a class when its done and search for .editable:not(.alreadyProcessed)
[07:57:19] <anli> I am putting contents in a div by using div.find('.placeholder').html(foo);, it seems that outerwidth is not set correctly at the beginning, is there an event when I can expect to have a new outerwidth?
[07:58:58] <xec_> juboba: jeditable is not an event - so you can't "bind" it to anything. forget about delegate. what you need to to is simply call the plugin again on the new content after it is generated -- which begs the question; how is the new content generated?
[07:59:09] <xec_> s/to to/to do
[07:59:49] <lathan> anli, unless you are running other javascript code, the outerWidth should update instantly: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/QPAPb/
[08:01:33] <lathan> xec_, but he could have his loading code trigger a custom event named jeditable
[08:03:51] <xec_> lathan: sure. but why not just have the loading code call the plugin directly - adding an event sounds a bit roundabout (as does the extra class tbh)
[08:04:34] <lathan> xec_, it matters if the code that is loading it is too generic and used more often then just for editable code
[08:04:59] <lathan> xec_, and its not like you have to create the custom event...its just a string matching from the trigger to the bind
[08:05:04] <lathan> ish
[08:05:18] <lathan> (yah..its a little more than that....but not too much)
[08:10:35] <scarlet_razor> hi....

[08:14:34] <PBDev> it aint working
[08:14:37] <scarlet_razor> so how to get value from my dropable ui
[08:14:45] <PBDev> I know you need to show and hide
[08:14:52] <PBDev> and make visible on click
[08:15:07] <xckpd7> question: how expensive is it to target children of a class as opposed to caching the same class and then just chaining on that cached one
[08:15:15] <PBDev> if anyone can help, I have live site and jquery file in pastebin
[08:15:37] <Chris_CC> xec_: demo of my button bash probelm here http://www.carclubbed.com/index.php (user = bmw_z3_1@email.com pass = passwordccalpha  ... add a comment to any of the posts by hammering the POST COMMENT button (it will show up as 1 comment, but refresh the page and it will show lots)
[08:15:45] <xckpd7> like right now I have this .widget class I'm targeting, and then in my app I'm doing $('.widget .content'), $('.widget .decoration')
[08:16:00] <xckpd7> and I'm wondering if I should cache widget and then select content and decoration from that cached selector
[08:16:05] <PBDev> anyone???
[08:16:07] <lathan> xckpd7, class selectors are native
[08:16:12] <lathan> so they will be fast
[08:16:16] <xec_> Chris_CC: so, you're wondering why three clicks will trigger a click event three times?
[08:16:18] <lathan> selecting the children is also native
[08:16:37] <Chris_CC> xec_: I know hy it does it, I want to stop it is all :)
[08:17:02] <Chris_CC> xec_: i have tried hiding the button on click, but it's too slow :/
[08:17:18] <lathan> docmur, newdiv will be the string of the selected divs' innerHTML
[08:17:35] <lathan> (not including the <div id="..." ...> and </div> tags)
[08:17:45] <lathan> docmur, you might want to see ?clone

[08:20:04] <xec_> Chris_CC: this page is too big and messy to see what you're doing. make a boiled down testcase in jsfiddle please
[08:20:05] <lathan> Chris_CC, see ?jquery throttle
[08:20:06] <bot-t> Chris_CC, jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/

[08:20:21] <docmur> cool, that looks like exactly what I need :-)
[08:20:24] <lathan> ?g jquery throttle @ Chris_CC
[08:20:25] <bot-t> Chris_CC, Ben Alman ª jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[08:20:34] <Chris_CC> thanks ^^
[08:20:39] <xec_> Chris_CC: if you want an event handler toonly fire once you can use .one()
[08:20:40] <lathan> np
[08:20:52] <lathan> xec_, I think Chris_CC wants double click protection
[08:21:00] <lathan> I sent throttle/debounce to 'em'
[08:21:09] <Chris_CC> xec_: i tried /.one and it broke on multi clicks :(
[08:21:35] <lathan> Chris_CC, it just means you have to rebind it when you want it to work again....throttle or debounce is more what you want
[08:21:37] <PBDev> QUESTION: jquery menu that hides/shows submenu on click. Can anyone help?
[08:21:52] <PBDev> currently have a livesite that is almost working
[08:22:06] <PBDev> I think the targetting is the problem
[08:22:13] <lathan> PBDev, link?
[08:22:21] <lathan> demo
[08:22:39] <PBDev> http://www.londonpumps.co.uk/hvac-clean-water-division.html
[08:23:02] <PBDev> its the brand section that will show/hide onclick, like an accordion menu
[08:23:52] <PBDev> http://pastebin.com/qSFaX1fD
[08:24:24] <xec_> lathan: i can see that. sure, throttle would work, but really is overkill for something this simple.
[08:24:37] <PBDev> html part http://pastebin.com/BTuR9Xye
[08:25:54] <xec_> Chris_CC: i don't even see a button marked "POST COMMENT"
[08:26:14] <Chris_CC> xec_:  press the black button with "..." on one of the posts
[08:26:24] <Chris_CC> need to label buttons still :P
[08:26:52] <lathan> Chris_CC, .one is designed to unbind itself after 1 click.
[08:27:01] <hlve> http://www.askvg.com/internet-explorer-10-ie10-for-windows-7-coming-in-november-2012/
[08:27:02] <hlve> what the fuck
[08:27:04] <xec_> Chris_CC: where is the javascript handling the click event
[08:27:06] <lathan> Chris_CC, so you would need to redo the .one when you wanted it to be clickable again
[08:27:15] <hlve> oh sorry, wrong channel
[08:27:15] <hlve> lol
[08:27:44] <Chris_CC> xec_: clicking the button labeled "..." will create it, it's jsut above the form for writing a comment
[08:28:15] <Chris_CC> lathan: i have the button disapear once clicked anyway so that wouldn;t be a problem, however i can;t seem to get .one working :/ will try some more
[08:29:34] <Chris_CC> lathan: ok .one("click", function() works .. but for some reason on clicking lots, it refreshes the page
[08:30:30] <xec_> Chris_CC: most likely because its a submit button. that's what a normal submit button does - submits a form and refreshes the page
[08:31:02] <Chris_CC> xec_: so if i get rid of submit wit should work?
[08:31:16] <PBDev> hello
[08:32:01] <Chris_CC> xec_: removing type still makes it refresh, is that a byproduct of <button> ?
[08:33:00] <xec_> Chris_CC: yes, default type is submit (if not specified)
[08:34:18] <starsinmypockets> I'm loading a form in an iframe... I want the iframe to disappear when the submit button is clicked... (without overriding the submit) What is a good way to do this?
[08:34:49] <lathan> starsinmypockets, is the iframe loading from the same domain as your main page?
[08:34:54] <xec_> Chris_CC: better approach would be to either keep track of the state (set a var "hasBeenClicked" or something) and not use .one() -- or you can have a seperate handler just for preventing default behaviour
[08:35:01] <lathan> like www.example.com/ and forms.example.com wouldn't work
[08:35:29] <PBDev> you asked for link? > lathan
[08:36:06] <lathan> I'm not sure
[08:36:07] <Chris_CC> xec_: Thanks, I;ve put in another function that calls return false; on the button click, so that it doesnt refresh the page, seems to be working good now :)
[08:37:12] <Heather_> is this correct $(document).on('hide', 'selector'); This should hide the element with selector attr right?
[08:37:30] <PBDev> can you help me out
[08:37:42] <PBDev> QUESTION: jquery menu that hides/shows submenu on click. Can anyone help?
[08:37:48] <PBDev> html part http://pastebin.com/BTuR9Xye
[08:37:54] <PBDev> http://pastebin.com/qSFaX1fD
[08:37:57] <xec_> PBDev: it's more likely to receive help if you make a boiled down testcase on a live pastebin
[08:38:16] <lathan> Heather_, no....you would want $(selector).hide()
[08:38:18] <Chris_CC_> bah, freenode crapped out on me :(
[08:38:26] <xec_> PBDev: i just opened one of those links and thought NOPE
[08:38:52] <starpile> lathan - Yeah, I'm loading a form from the same domain
[08:39:06] <lathan> PBDev, I prefer jsfiddle or jsbin over paste
[08:39:39] <lathan> starpile, $('iframe').contents('form').on('submit', functino(){  $('iframe').hide() });
[08:39:43] <PBDev> doesn't that require setting it up for it to work. Wouldn't that take long?
[08:39:46] <lathan> starpile, or something like that^^...rough draft
[08:39:47] <xec_> Chris_CC: i don't think you missed much (anything) ;)
[08:40:25] <starpile> lathan - you or  ... $(this).closest('iframe').hide()
[08:40:32] <starpile> isn't working for me tho :/
[08:41:27] <xec_> PBDev: anyone helping in here are volunteers spending their free time. If you spend some time on creating a testcase it shows you're making an effort too. Also, you just might find the solution yourself when you're boiling it down
[08:41:43] <starpile> lathan http://jsfiddle.net/cKpnf/
[08:42:04] <PBDev> http://pastebin.com/qGKdryqT boiled down, all in one paste
[08:44:03] <xec_> PBDev: do you have a version that doesn't contain PHP?
[08:44:13] <xec_> like, the rendered plain html version
[08:44:15] <PBDev> unfortunately no
[08:44:22] <PBDev> but the problem is with the jquery
[08:44:31] <PBDev> the live site is http://www.londonpumps.co.uk/hvac-clean-water-division.html#
[08:44:41] <xec_> then do view source in your browser :)
[08:45:00] <PBDev> I think something wrong in the show hide part
[08:45:13] <xec_> or at least tell me what the php renders
[08:45:24] <xec_> what is URL_PUBLIC
[08:46:11] <dblosevn> xec_: most likely the protocal and domain / path to the script ie http://www.londonpumps.co.uk
[08:47:31] <PBDev> yes
[08:47:36] <PBDev> that is working
[08:48:18] <xec_> PBDev: doesnt matter. i replaced it with whatever and pasted it into a live pastebin for you: http://jsfiddle.net/h65Sd/
[08:48:28] <xec_> PBDev: now, what is this code supposed to do
[08:48:44] <PBDev> it should just expand like an accordion to show submenu
[08:48:56] <PBDev> if you check with firebug, the submenu items are there, just hidden
[08:49:42] <xec_> PBDev: in your html you have <ul><a></a>...</ul>¬®
[08:49:59] <xec_> PBDev: the only valid element in UL is LI
[08:50:01] <PBDev> that is the top part for title. Do I need an <li> there?
[08:50:04] <xec_> yes
[08:50:23] <xec_> did you make this initMenu plugin yourself?
[08:51:20] <PBDev> no found it from google long time ago, and implemented somewhere else which worked.
[08:52:15] <xec_> PBDev: could you explain what it's supposed to do? just toggle a child list on click?
[08:52:49] <PBDev> yes. Just display it
[08:52:52] <xec_> or is it more like the accordion where only one submenu can be open at a time?
[08:53:00] <PBDev> I wanted to hide it bcoz there are way too many submenus
[08:53:10] <PBDev> they all open at the same time
[08:53:25] <PBDev> so when I click search by brand, the entire submenus should appear
[08:53:26] <starpile> Visit http://maverickjetpants.com and click 'Drop a pin' - the iframe should be hidden with save click (mjextras.js) - any ideas?
[08:55:29] <PBDev> any ideas?
[08:56:08] <Already> Is there an easy way to extract data from an rss2 feed using jquery?
[08:56:47] <xec_> PBDev: how about something like this http://jsfiddle.net/h65Sd/1/
[08:57:57] <xec_> PBDev: it depends on the submenu list to be the next sibling of the top level link, but i assume you have control over the html
[09:00:09] <xec_> PBDev: do you understand what i did there, how it works?
[09:00:25] <PBDev> yes. thanks. trying to implement it.
[09:01:07] <PBDev> it worked! Thanks :-) I put it on the live site if you want to check.
[09:03:02] <PBDev> so after accomplishing that, how can we give it that accordin look?
[09:03:25] <PBDev> I mean slow down the animation, to see the slide down of the submenus?
[09:03:31] <xec_> you mean the animation?
[09:04:23] <xec_> PBDev: http://jsfiddle.net/h65Sd/3/
[09:04:58] <PBDev> yeah. exactly
[09:08:30] <lathan> starpile, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/cKpnf/1/
[09:08:36] <lathan> (assuming that #location-modal is the iframe
[09:08:37] <lathan> )
[09:10:15] <scarlet_razor> hi... im coming again :)
[09:10:22] <scarlet_razor> and asking again.. hehe
[09:10:35] <scarlet_razor> how to get value from dropable....
[09:10:57] <eip56> best way to select  form select nodes .filter('select')?
[09:11:09] <gpantazis> Qunit question: anyone know of a way to allow x-domain window access for qunit to test through an iframe?
[09:11:10] <lathan> scarlet_razor, what value? at what point? see ?demo
[09:11:11] <bot-t> scarlet_razor, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:11:14] <gpantazis> Or an approach that would accomplish the same goal? I've got pages that are rendered with the backend that I'd like to test as they are.
[09:11:24] <gpantazis> (Sorry for the x-posts for peeps in multiple channels)
[09:11:37] <lathan> eip56, filter only filters what you have already selected, it doesn't search children.
[09:11:46] <lathan> eip56, I think you mean .find('select')
[09:11:58] <scarlet_razor> oke .. i creating it first....
[09:12:00] <eip56> ah thanks yea and thats what i meant
[09:13:10] <PBDev> thank you very much
[09:14:50] <Already> Would it make sense to but $(document).ready(function(){ in an external js script?
[09:14:54] <Already> but = put
[09:17:04] <lathan> Already, yes, because unless the script tag loading it is at the end of the file it will get loaded before other things
[09:17:21] <lathan> Already, however, try some of the shorthands if you like: $(function(){  });
[09:17:29] <lathan> passing jQuery a function will do the .ready
[09:17:50] <lathan> scarlet_razor, just let me know when you have something for me
[09:18:00] <lathan> although I may be going to eat shortly
[09:18:10] <Already> Oh OK. That's handy. Thanks lathan!
[09:18:20] <lathan> ?np
[09:18:21] <bot-t> No Problem
[09:21:15] <BabySuperman> How come $('#myFormInput').val(''); isnt resetting my input box -- but when i do it in chrom console it works fine =\
[09:21:37] <lathan> BabySuperman, check the timing of when it runs in your code
[09:21:42] <lathan> see if anything else sets the value
[09:22:01] <lathan> verify that line actually runs by doing a console.log to verify that it selects the element)
[09:22:01] <BabySuperman> im doing console.log and it seems like it's changing the value, but i'm not seeing it get changed
[09:22:05] <BabySuperman> but when I do it from chome it works
[09:22:21] <lathan> BabySuperman, if that doesnt work, then see ?demo
[09:22:22] <bot-t> BabySuperman, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:22:25] <NoiseEee> BabySuperman: as opposed to doing it from where?
[09:22:29] <BabySuperman> yep, im doing console.log of $(element), $(element).var() and $(element).var('')
[09:23:00] <BabySuperman> NoiseEee, I am trying to reset it after a user selects an item from a Typeahead dropdown below an input
[09:23:17] <BabySuperman> NoiseEee, it seems like i AM changing the val, but just not seeing it displayed... very strange
[09:23:29] <lathan> BabySuperman, is the console.log happening in your console, or is it running in the code
[09:23:30] <lathan> ?
[09:23:35] <eip56> How do i find the value of a say form field when the page is loaded as opposed to if a user updated in?
[09:23:37] <BabySuperman> oh DOH, it must be setting the input after I am resetting the value
[09:23:37] <lathan> make a demo of it
[09:23:44] <NoiseEee> is it a <select>?  if so, is there in fact an option with value='' ?
[09:23:47] <BabySuperman> lathan, I think i figured it out
[09:23:50] <NoiseEee> otherwise demp
[09:24:00] <lathan> eip56, you might try .attr('value') (unless its a textarea)
[09:24:13] <BabySuperman> noiseEee, I think I am just resetting it BEFORE the 'set input value to selected item' code gets called -- I must be anyway :)
[09:24:16] <BabySuperman> which makes this more complicated lol
[09:24:32] <BabySuperman> yep that was it lol
[09:24:37] <BabySuperman> doh :(
[09:24:42] <lathan> fun stuff
[09:24:44] <lathan> we all make those
[09:25:55] <BabySuperman> lathan, srsly :)
[09:26:04] <lathan> ?np @ BabySuperman
[09:26:04] <bot-t> BabySuperman, No Problem
[09:26:17] <BabySuperman> wtf lol
[09:26:31] <lathan> ?
[09:26:35] <lathan> ?bot

[09:42:35] <wunderCatze> hello, is there a channel for kinetic.js?
[09:43:14] <Aamir> similar to jsdocs and jsduck, anyone recon something to document jQuery plugins/code
[09:44:38] <Wilto> what huh miketaylr
[09:44:57] <miketaylr> pay no attention to me, i just some bacon
[09:45:02] <miketaylr> my brain is hazy
[09:45:05] <miketaylr> +ate
[09:45:08] <miketaylr> PROOF
[09:45:49] <wunderCatze> I start today working with kinetic.js and I receive an error on the .js kinetic file: TypeError: this.attrs.container is null? I am using jquery, the same. Anyone ring a bell?
[09:46:20] <wunderCatze> or is there a kinetic.js channel?
[09:47:19] <Aamir> wunderCatze: follow them on twitter and ask them if they can help
[09:47:20] <lethjakman_work> any reason a $(document).ready(function() {}); wouldn't be running?
[09:47:34] <lethjakman_work> it just doesn't go....it's weird.
[09:47:49] <Already> I'm trying to have an animated slideshow of li elements. Should i get a plugin or is something like this easy enough to implement oneself?
[09:47:50] <therealkoopa> Anyone know of any plugins (for jquery or even bootstrap) that give you a dropdown menu that is like a menu on an iphone? Where each menu option slides into some new menu?
[09:47:56] <Aamir> lethjakman_work:  try $(function(){ //yourcode });
[09:48:32] <Already> lethjakman_work are you using any other framework? Maybe there's a conflict.
[09:48:55] <Aamir> therealklanni:  http://marinovdh.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/use-the-iphone-uipickerview-control-as-a-selectbox-on-your-website-with-jquery/
[09:49:05] <lethjakman_work> Aamir: still not working.
[09:49:10] <lethjakman_work> Already: no I'm not
[09:49:32] <lethjakman_work> the weird thing is I tried breakpoints, and it m akes it to the $(document).ready(), but it just skips over it afterwords
[09:49:36] <Aamir> lethjakman_work: show your code :|
[09:49:45] <lethjakman_work> alright one sec
[09:49:55] <starpile> Hmm.. struggling with this for a minute - I need a button click inside an iframe to remove the iframe itself - my click function can access anything within the frame, but not the containing frame itself..
[09:50:50] <lethjakman_work> http://jsfiddle.net/lethjakman/BmkdA/
[09:53:04] <wunderCatze> @lethjakman_work have you tried putting ALL in the $(document).ready() ? including the vars and the functions?
[09:54:05] <lethjakman_work> I just tried it
[09:54:07] <wunderCatze> or have you tried using different selector, like jquery(document) ?
[09:54:15] <wunderCatze> didnt works?
[09:54:19] <lethjakman_work> no,
[09:54:36] <lethjakman_work> the really weird thing about this...is I thought it was the:
[09:54:38] <lethjakman_work>   if($('.property-value textarea').length > 0) {
[09:54:38] <lethjakman_work>     console.log("hello");
[09:54:38] <lethjakman_work>     createSelect();
[09:54:39] <lethjakman_work>   }
[09:54:46] <lethjakman_work> but it's not......
[09:54:52] <ravenzz> so given n elements, whould you bind an event to each of them and then trigger it whenever you have data OR bind 1 event to the parent and select the element (by id)?
[09:55:04] <lethjakman_work> this executes on other pages, but it just doesn't execute without the cookie.
[09:55:45] <scarlet_razor> how to get value for ajax purpose in the jq ui dropable... http://jsfiddle.net/hUc6B/
[09:56:34] <wunderCatze> @lethjakman_work: I used in your fiddle an alert('111'); and it's working fine.
[09:56:50] <wunderCatze> just in your  $(document).ready()
[09:57:21] <lethjakman_work> wunderCatze: you're right...it must just be my page
[09:57:59] <wunderCatze> I'm sorry, but your   $(document).ready() is working fine
[09:58:17] <wunderCatze> check your browser; delete history or something
[09:58:36] <lethjakman_work> I tried tossing the alert into my actual page and it's not working.
[09:59:22] <wunderCatze> :D
[09:59:30] <lethjakman_work> wunderCatze: hm, I did I'll try it in firefox too
[10:00:07] <lethjakman_work> really weird. the alert works in firefox, but the code doesn't execute.
[10:01:47] <sjeijk> hi all
[10:02:15] <sjeijk> i have a problem with my drop down menu on iPad with this site http://www.paushuize.nl
[10:03:23] <sjeijk> the problem is that when i click on the 1st top menu, and then on the next sub menu the navigation is getting weird
[10:03:39] <sjeijk> because the submenu links are links themselves asswell
[10:04:47] <sjeijk> so when i double click it opens the url, thats fine, but when i click a submenu item, then if i click on the submenu itself on the next click, it will directly go to the link instead of opening the submenu
[10:05:37] <sjeijk> so i was wondering if someone has ever had something similar, and maybe a solution to it
[10:12:28] <Danielpk> any1 know any plugin to stick element when scroll window?
[10:15:04] <Kcko> Danielpk -- use css and position: fixed;
[10:16:56] <Danielpk> Kcko it is like H1 element that i want to hold at top when user scroll page down.
[10:20:12] <Kcko> Danielpk  it does not matter  try position: fixed

[10:38:06] <xckpd7> let's say I have a 1 page document, and I have a bunch of js.... should I use an asynchronous loader for the benefit of speed?
[10:38:55] <lathan> xckpd7, some people put them at the end, some people make them load from different subdomains (the browser loads each subdomain in parallel...ish)
[10:39:04] <xckpd7> a bunch of js being like 7 different files... some small (jsonp library, pubsub library, clipboard library) and some bigger (jquery, handlebars, underscore)
[10:39:11] <lathan> xckpd7, use the Net tab in Chrome or FF and check the timing
[10:39:39] <lathan> xckpd7, one option is to find a package that will mimize them into 1 file with all the whitespace removed...
[10:41:29] <xckpd7> lathan: I'm an idiot, I forgot about that
[10:42:14] <lathan> xckpd7, I would use the net tab to time it before doing anything
[10:42:22] <lathan> see which files are takign longer, what is holding it up the most
[10:42:39] <lathan> you could probably even concatenate several libraries per file

[11:04:24] <gelicia> is there a channel that would be good for more general "what would you recommend I do?" webdev questions?
[11:04:46] <djsounds02> this is a pretty general channel
[11:05:11] <djsounds02> give it a try gelicia then atelast can recommend somewhere suitable too!
[11:06:41] <tw2113> gelicia, it's pretty on topic as long as it's about jquery
[11:07:22] <gelicia> okay, thanks :) basically I have a <select multiple="true"> element that I need to add a link to the end of some of the selections that would pop up a jquery dialog. Im assuming I have to use a <table> and make it look like a select, is that right, and has anyone seen anything where someone had this same problem?
[11:42:34] <docmur> What does this mean "Split descendant selectors which are perfaced with id selectors" mean?   It's a jquery warning on this $('#userBar button')
[11:43:11] <NoiseEee> use $('#userBar').find('button') instead
[11:43:37] <docmur> and that is more effecient then what I had?
[11:43:55] <NoiseEee> what gave you that warning?
[11:44:24] <docmur> PHP Storm ( horrible IDE ) But I don't want to find the button, I want any button in userbar to activated that selector
[11:45:16] <NoiseEee> well fwiw i use that IDE, don't get that error, and both selectors do the same thing
[11:45:21] <NoiseEee> so go with what you like best
[11:45:28] <docmur> oh okay
[11:45:29] <NoiseEee> oh, i do get that error
[11:45:57] <docmur> I just wondered why it gave me it when the syntax is legal
[11:46:00] <NoiseEee> the reason its saying that iirc is that chances are you're going to be using #userBar elsewhere, so if thats the case, cache it once and use .find() off it
[11:46:25] <docmur> oh okay
[11:50:36] <bil`> hi
[11:51:52] <Jon47> docmur: also it's a lot faster to do $('#userBar').find('button') than $('#userBar button');  the docuemnt has an insanely well indexed search for id selectors, and then once you've got a handle on that you've got a much smaller dom fragment to search within for the less quick tag selector
[11:52:06] <docmur> oh
[11:52:12] <docmur> I would of never actually guessed that
[11:53:35] <bil`> Is there anything in jQuery to delete the last N of elements from a matched set
[11:55:23] <Jon47> docmur: it's a consequence of sizzle parsing css selectors the same way a browser does - from right to left
[11:55:25] <Eviltwin> You use a slice then remove
[11:55:33] <Eviltwin> bil`: ^
[11:56:12] <docmur> Okay then I may as well ask when I use $('#div') multiple times I get a warning but if I use var newDiv = '#div' then reference $(newDiv) the warning goes away
[11:56:27] <docmur> should I be using the var method?
[11:56:31] <bil`> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:56:56] <NoiseEee> docmur: everytime you use $('#div') your JS searches the document for that ID
[11:57:12] <NoiseEee> docmur: cache it.  var div = $('#div');   div.doAnythingElse()
[11:58:44] <Jon47> docmur: that's just a flaw in the warning system - it probably doesn't know how to check your variable to see if it's the same string everytime
[11:59:26] <Jon47> the idea is to limit the number of times you call the $ function and ask it to query the DOM, and optimize for the times that you do have to do it
[12:02:29] <xckpd7> can anyone point me to a guide for caching mustache / handlebar templates?
[12:03:03] <Shanimal> xckpd7: i put my templates in the html
[12:03:26] <xckpd7> Shanimal: yeah my templates are there... I want to externalize for 2 reasons
[12:03:44] <xckpd7> Shanimal: if the templates are in a JS file, the client can cache the files for faster loading
[12:04:01] <xckpd7> Shanimal: and reason 2: in my templates, I need to have <script> tags
[12:04:18] <xckpd7> Shanimal: so I can't just randomly have script tags in my html
[12:05:17] <Shanimal> xckpd7: interesting.

[12:06:43] <UltraMC_2> ?
[12:06:45] <libryder> hi all. i have this: https://gist.github.com/8522b4fe9ea51f61ac70 and it works, unless group_name has spaces in it
[12:07:08] <UltraMC_2> libryder, how class can have spaces?
[12:07:26] <UltraMC_2> its agains CSS syntax
[12:07:38] <libryder> UltraMC_2:  group_name comes from the value of a select box
[12:07:48] <libryder> oh i see what you're saying
[12:08:07] <UltraMC_2> $('#group_'+group_name) - you are selecting an element here, ID to be correct
[12:08:19] <UltraMC_2> IDs can not have space in CSS
[12:08:30] <libryder> didn't even think about that‚Ä¶ hmmm.
[12:08:47] <UltraMC_2> What do you want to do?
[12:09:45] <libryder> i have a groups of elements that need to be identifiable by user input, so i can move elements around
[12:10:23] <libryder> right now i'm doing  <tbody id="group_<%= group_name %>">
[12:10:29] <UltraMC_2> libryder, so you say that user types in input and jQuery selects what is typed?
[12:10:39] <UltraMC_2> selects element that is typed
[12:11:03] <libryder> pretty much, i am trying to move a <tr> from one tbody to another
[12:11:09] <libryder> and group_name is created by the user
[12:11:10] <docmur> Okay so does doing something like div.show().empty().hide() provide better preformance then div.show(); div.empty(); div.hide()
[12:11:38] <UltraMC_2> libryder, its problem in having a space. Change selecting conditions (use numeric ID's or something) or encode it: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeuri.asp
[12:12:24] <libryder> thanks UltraMC_2 i think i'm going to remove all special characters with regex
[12:13:59] <libryder> docmur:  i think those are technically the same thing. but you can do a simple d = new Date(); console.log(d.getMilliseconds()) before and after each operation (iterated ~500 times)
[12:14:13] <docmur> oh okay, well just checking
[12:14:20] <UltraMC_2> docmur, speedtest it by yourself ;-)
[12:14:21] <UltraMC_2> Why I see no AJAX result in #konsola http://pastebin.com/0KuRVPRw ?
[12:14:50] <UltraMC_2> docmur, what about toggle()?
[12:16:45] <docmur> well that was an example
[12:16:53] <docmur> if I was going to do that I would use toggle
[12:18:02] <danshtr> Hi All. I am looking for a sidebar menu plugin with sub menus. Something like accordion + menu inside it. Any recommended plugin?
[12:19:35] <NoiseEee> docmur: in general, better to chain
[12:19:52] <NoiseEee> docmur: will you notice a perceptible difference?  no.
[12:20:32] <NoiseEee> in general: cache selectors.  keep code readable to everyone else.  be merry.
[12:22:49] <mouses> whats best practice for using a spinner gif while loading photos? do you set the gif as a background image?
[12:29:02] <phrakture> hey guys, I have a super quick question that I can't find in the docs. i have a document that contains <h3> headers followed by N <p>s before another <h3> - i am snagging one specific h3 by id, then using h3.nextUntil('h3') to get the stuff below it
[12:29:20] <phrakture> if I use .html() on this collection, I get the contents without <p> tags, but I would like the tags
[12:29:36] <phrakture> how do I get .outerHTML on the collection?
[12:30:02] <Jon47> .each maybe
[12:30:22] <Jon47> i htink those functions tend to just return the result from the first element in the collection
[12:30:33] <lathan> phrakture, you place it in a parent <div> and get the innHTML on that parent dev
[12:31:34] <phrakture> lathan: as in $("<div>").html(h3.nextUntil('h3')).html() ?
[12:32:39] <phrakture> huh, that works. great
[12:34:11] <BillCriswell> I never even heard of nextUntil() oO
[12:34:29] <phrakture> i found it at random and it fit my needs perfectly

[12:54:28] <gf3> Shush!
[12:55:49] <FrameFever> is here a jquery IE8 expert?
[12:56:15] <hlve> lol. IE8.
[12:56:17] * hlve shudders
[12:56:24] <FrameFever> come on
[12:56:33] <hlve> Just ask your question, and someone will help you.
[12:56:35] <hlve> ;p
[12:56:54] <FrameFever> I want to use a a moseenter event on a div, which content will be shown when the mouse enters
[12:56:55] * gf3 breaks out into hives and dies from anaphylactic shock
[12:56:58] <FrameFever> mouseenter
[12:57:05] <FrameFever> sry
[12:57:48] <FrameFever> it seems to be that when the content is invisible, then the mouseenter event is not recoginized
[12:57:53] <FrameFever> what can I do about this?
[12:58:02] <gf3> Make the content visible
[12:58:38] <FrameFever> but I want to do this only when the mouse enters
[12:59:05] <YammYcoding> hello! I need anyone to look into a site and tell me what code is making the images animation. WHo can see it for me quicky?
[13:00:06] <gf3> FrameFever: Put it in a container, put your event listeners on the container
[13:00:31] <YammYcoding> the site have tons os script, i can't isolate the one that animates the thing
[13:00:48] <FrameFever> gf3: what do you mean? This is my current solution
[13:01:04] <FrameFever> the container is connected to the mouseenter event
[13:01:10] <FrameFever> but the content is not visible
[13:01:32] <NoiseEee> FrameFever: so, when you hover over something that isnt on the page, you want it visible on the page  o.O
[13:01:52] <YammYcoding> anyone? I will paste the link pvt
[13:01:55] <YammYcoding> =)
[13:02:44] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: no you don't get it, the container is on the page and visible, but he has not content
[13:03:01] <FrameFever> when I go with my mouse over the container, the content should be visible
[13:03:24] <FrameFever> its a slider button
[13:03:45] <FrameFever> only when you go to the most right corner of the picture it will be visible
[13:19:27] <MrPunkin> FrameFever: so you already have the element on the right side of the image but don't actually have the indicator showing up as you hover it?
[13:23:06] <goddard> ?
[13:26:39] <dualcore> goddard: are you doing an ajax request?  i think its just saying it completed
[13:26:45] <KWhat_Work> Any idea where $.ui.datepicker.prototype is located?
[13:28:24] <UltraMC_2> How to select 2nd ancestor above? $(this).parent().parent().find('.TITLE').attr('id'); ? ;-)
[13:29:53] <KWhat_Work> for having had a complete rewrite this widget is still a piece of shit
[13:35:14] <MrPunkin> Whats the proper means for writing a large namespaced script that doesn't rely on being attached to a specific element like a plugin does?
[13:36:43] <bil`> js fiddle just get slow as shit for anyone else?
[13:39:16] <UltraMC_2> bil not really
[13:39:23] <UltraMC_2> try stopping torrents :DDD
[13:39:41] <WebDragon|away> when you guys have a string of li's that you're filling with images from Picasa or Flickr or some other stream of images that the page builds on the fly after loading, how do you attach something to it like jquery.cycle or jcarousel, or fancybox/slimbox/etc, when the UL hasn't even been built yet at document.ready?
[13:40:32] <WebDragon|away> it's not something that would be event driven like clicks or such, so I'm just phasing on how I'd use .on() or the older and now deprecated .live() for something like that. doesn't seem the right fit
[13:40:54] <UltraMC_2> WebDragon|away, I have class ".loading", all unfinished loads has ".loading", after finishing request hooking event to it and clearing this class
[13:41:08] <WebDragon|away> the thing that fills the container with picasa pics doesn't have a finalizer callback, so I can't defer it that way
[13:41:37] <UltraMC_2> WebDragon|away, do you know number of pulled pics?
[13:41:41] <WebDragon|away> but it's still something that has to happen dynamically, _later_
[13:41:42] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: What about polling the wrapper div for a piece of content you know will exist or something?
[13:41:48] <WebDragon|away> UltraMC_2: no, it can vary at any time
[13:42:15] <UltraMC_2> WebDragon|away, count them and attach this number of events?
[13:42:22] <WebDragon|away> MrPunkin: that's a thought, but if it's only half full of images on a slow picasa day, it would leave me with some unstyled
[13:42:50] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: Do they offer an API to use with Ajax rather than relying on their widgets?
[13:42:56] <WebDragon|away> UltraMC_2: I had the client use picasa so they had total control of their image stream for their apartment complex interior shots, so they can add/remove them at will
[13:43:05] <WebDragon|away> counting them isn't necessary; I just want to make it a jcarousel
[13:43:24] <UltraMC_2> had no chance to do it really, sorry
[13:43:25] <UltraMC_2> How to select 2nd ancestor above? $(this).parent().parent().find('.TITLE').attr('id'); ? ;-)
[13:44:06] <WebDragon|away> MrPunkin: it's possible, but this was the best of the scripts I found and I STILL had to hack the hell out of the interior to remove all the extraneous unnecesary markup and embedded styles that are better suited for skins
[13:44:43] <WebDragon|away> THEN I had something jcarousel would work with... only it won't because the container isn't filled by the time jcarouel would fire against it at doc ready
[13:45:12] <WebDragon|away> I've got a halfway decent workaround for the time being but a carousel would be better looking for the client
[13:45:22] <KWhat_Work> Anyone?  Datepicker prototype for extension?
[13:45:50] <WebDragon|away> doesn't UI have a datepicker?
[13:46:50] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: I assume their widget uses a script tag?
[13:48:25] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: Also, assuming it does, do you know then does it use document.write or does it handle its element rendering a different way?
[13:48:28] <WebDragon|away> MrPunkin: I could pastebin the hacked version I have now if that would help you determine that :D but if that is a simpler thing like is it in <script --> then yeah
[13:48:43] <WebDragon|away> easier to fpaste : half a mo
[13:49:24] <KWhat_Work> WebDragon|away: yah its got the datepicker, what is the $.ui.datepicker.prototype?
[13:49:43] <WebDragon|away> http://fpaste.org/iA7f/  there it is, MrPunkin
[13:50:05] <WebDragon|away> KWhat_Work: that I don't know.. #jqueryui might?
[13:51:20] <UltraMC_2> WebDragon|away, "this *little* script"
[13:51:22] <WebDragon|away> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_esYONwdKuw damn I got The Veldt stuck in my head now
[13:51:44] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: So this is a local script you have control over?
[13:52:01] <WebDragon|away> oh yeah that's what's running now
[13:52:17] <WebDragon> had a devil of a time finding the right one
[13:52:23] <WebDragon> still had to hack it
[13:53:02] <WebDragon> probably a better way but most of the other scripts were involved in wordpress plugins and other things. few standalone jquery scripts for picasa for some reason .. more for flickr
[13:54:16] <MrPunkin> WebDragon|away: I'd just put in a call to trigger a custom event like 'picasa:loaded' into the script where all you need is rendered. Then bind to that in your own script
[13:55:01] <WebDragon> I'm really sort of annoyed it doesn't have a callback like fadeIn does so I can just fire it off when completed
[13:55:01] <UltraMC_2> Need help with selecting 2nd ancestor for jquery-ui http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12963443/select-2nd-ancestor-of-clicked-element
[13:55:17] <WebDragon> that may have to do
[13:55:19] <zfly9> hey anyone have any suggestions? I need to have a div that can "flip" on hover, html on both sites
[13:55:25] <WebDragon> at least I can hack on it :D
[13:55:35] <MrPunkin> WebDragon: You may want to reverse-engineer this script though if all you need is HTML to render into a div to use for your lightbox stuff as it looks like it simply pulls a JSON response from google and then renders based on that. If you require your own custom HTML anyways you could remove all the cruft.
[13:56:00] <WebDragon> yeah I already removed a bunch
[13:56:25] <WebDragon> it was all this crazy nested div stuff and appends empty divs even if I specify no title or text
[13:56:52] <WebDragon> I just don't have time to refactor or roll my own at the moment
[13:57:17] <WebDragon> I can re-solve the problem after I push this out the door to make the client happy
[13:57:30] <WebDragon> and then publish it so no one else has to go through this
[13:57:57] <bil`> when using an anonymous function for event handlers, is there anyway to make 'this' refer to the selector object without having to pass it in http://jsfiddle.net/bil2k/44zq8/7/
[13:58:05] <bil`> as foo does
[14:00:31] <sahbeewah> bil`: $('.bar').on('click', function(){ bar.call(this); } );
[14:03:09] <bil`> oh cool thanks
[14:03:14] <bil`> figured there was a better way
[14:04:57] <bil`> well actually.. is that way inherently better than passing 'this' as just a normal argument?
[14:06:58] <sahbeewah> you don't need the parameters in the handling function
[14:07:02] <sahbeewah> depends on what you want to achieve
[14:07:08] <Already> As i can't talk in #html for whatever reason i'm going to ask a quick HTML question here. Please don't kill me for this ... should i embed an unorderd list in a <p> or should i follow </p>?
[14:08:18] <sahbeewah> what do you mean follow </p>?
[14:08:50] <bil`> Already: if the list's meaning directly relates the the content in the paragraph, i'd include it inside.
[14:09:01] <zfly9> hey anyone have any suggestions? I need to have a div that can "flip" on hover, html on both sites
[14:09:56] <Already> sahbeewah Either it would be <p>Text<ul></ul></p> or <p>Text</p><ul></ul>
[14:10:32] <Already> Thanks for your opinion bil`.
[14:12:26] <sahbeewah> yeah i agree with that
[14:12:35] <sahbeewah> doesn't really matter either which way
[14:13:24] <upmauro> http://dpaste.com/815267/, alert not show html source =(
[14:13:27] <sahbeewah> if the content is dynamic in that you'd need to change it via js you're probably best with the latter
[14:14:01] <Already> Well I was thinking about it from a semantic point view in which case their might be a difference.
[14:15:00] <Already> upmauro use console.log and it might just be an JS Object?
[14:15:33] <FrameFever> how can I drag an image? so that this is not the default drag and drop from the Browser is enabled
[14:16:29] <Already> FrameFever use a suiting JQuery Plugin or HTML5.
[14:17:17] <FrameFever> what jquery plugin?
[14:18:58] <NoiseEee> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/ @ FrameFever
[14:19:00] <Already> Just look for one. JQuery UI has something called draggable but i don't know what you intend to do.
[14:20:01] <sahbeewah> Already: i'm not sure how seo bots process uls inside ps and if they consider it more semantically related
[14:20:07] <sahbeewah> strictly speaking it's invalid html
[14:20:44] <Already> Oh OK. I didn't know it was invalid, in that case i'd stick to the valid solution.
[14:20:49] <rankz> http://jsfiddle.net/d7ZkC/1/ how can i blink the innerHTML when its over 0?
[14:21:03] <FrameFever> NoiseEee: I was looking for $(document).bind("dragstart", function(e) {
[14:21:22] <FrameFever> now it works
[14:21:29] <FrameFever> without any pluging
[14:28:20] <rankz> http://jsfiddle.net/d7ZkC/1/ how can i blink the innerHTML when its over 0?
[14:32:38] <Already> you mean like that rankz? http://jsfiddle.net/d7ZkC/3/
[14:33:36] <rankz> Already: hm. now they are both blinking. but only when its >0
[14:34:04] <Already> Just add an if around the parseInt and set the condition.
[14:34:07] <rankz> Already: and not the hole div only the numbers should bkink
[14:34:17] <Already> http://jsfiddle.net/d7ZkC/4/
[14:34:50] <Already> I'm not going to do all your work. It should be fairly easy to just make the text blink ...
[14:35:28] <rankz> Already: ok thx
[14:35:37] <rankz> Already: i try and error
[14:37:03] <Already> Just add a dummy element around the text and hide/unhide that or use css text-decoration: blink; ...
[14:44:15] <zfly9> hey guys I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/ and it works to flip this div, but how can I call something when hover is removed
[14:44:48] <zfly9> I need to call this $("#flipbox").revertFlip()
[14:45:52] <Already> First you should setup your fiddle to actually have some content that shows what your code does and if you check the documentation you'll see that you can supply 2 functions for .hover. One "onEnter" and one "onLeave".
[14:45:57] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[14:48:01] <zfly9> Already, do I replace .hover with ".onLeave" or is it .hover.onLeave or somethings
[14:48:06] <zfly9> something, sorry noob here
[14:49:25] <coldhead> .hover(onEnterFunction, onLeaveFunction)
[14:49:26] <bot-t> (1 hour 17 mins ago) <SlexAxton> tell coldhead i am coming to you Nov 12-20 - plan sexcordingly
[14:50:26] <Eviltwin> Nice
[14:52:58] <guy> anyone smart enough to figure out why is the setTimout callback triggered more than once?
[14:52:58] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/c5e22f1a-e772-5ad6-afff-9202af28e644/public/js/frontend.js
[14:53:26] <zfly9> coldhead, thanks man, I'll see if I can ever figure this out
[14:53:27] <Eviltwin> Because you have var timeout inside the mousemove handler
[14:53:33] <coldhead> bam
[14:53:39] <Eviltwin> That should just be timeout =
[14:53:42] <Eviltwin> Not var timeout =
[14:53:53] <coldhead> zfly9: the docs have examples and such :)
[14:53:54] <pixeltarian> Does anyone know of a jquery plugin that simply lists upcoming events from a google calendar?
[14:54:34] <guy> Eviltwin: uh!!!! moronic. Thank you.
[14:56:21] <shanimal> pixeltarian:  jQuery calendar?
[14:57:17] <pixeltarian> you mean UI datepicker?
[14:57:48] <pixeltarian> it is more for grabbing and displaying events than picking dates or navigating a calendar
[14:58:05] <coldhead> 3rd google result for me: http://sugi.github.com/jquery-gcal-flow/
[14:58:06] <coldhead> ?cc
[14:58:08] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:00:39] <pixeltarian> what did you search for?
[15:00:48] <pixeltarian> (ooc)
[15:01:05] <coldhead> jquery calendar google
[15:01:34] <shanimal> coldhead: "jquery google calendar" your link comes up first :p
[15:01:39] <shanimal> lol
[15:02:27] <pixeltarian> weird. I've been searching for like an hour
[15:02:33] <pixeltarian> and found nothing like it
[15:02:41] <pixeltarian> then agin, I use duck duck go
[15:02:45] <shanimal> take a break
[15:02:46] * shanimal giggles
[15:03:47] <shanimal> pixeltarian: just giving you a hard time. my coworkers used to tell me jfgi
[15:03:57] <shanimal> so rude
[15:05:09] <pixeltarian> np, I hope it's easy to style, but this is exactly what I wanted (I think)
[15:05:33] <pixeltarian> I'll take a tounge lashing in lew of help any day ;)
[15:10:41] <zfly9> can someone help me on this, I was able to get a hover function working but when I try hover & off hover it doesnt work
[15:10:42] <zfly9> http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/2/
[15:11:29] <zfly9> spelled function wrong, but corrected and still nothing
[15:11:52] <robgleeson> zfly9: look at on(‚Ä¶).
[15:12:58] <zfly9> huh
[15:31:14] <zfly9> pleaaaaase
[15:32:43] <shoky> zfly9: remove that onEnterFunction  and onLeaveFunction
[15:33:07] <shoky> unless, those are your functions?
[15:33:08] <zfly9> but i need it to do that revert when the mouse leaves
[15:33:12] <zfly9> no, not mine
[15:33:33] <shoky> er also what's .flip ;s
[15:33:35] <zfly9> I'm using this http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[15:35:42] <Cr0vaX> hi all
[15:36:22] <shoky> zfly9 i don't know about that plugin but this is how you use .hover: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gVHP9/4/
[15:36:36] <Cr0vaX> I need to refresh the page every x seconds and write the content of mysql query inside a div, any example?
[15:37:10] <Already> Cr0vaX setInterval and a AJAX/JSON request.
[15:37:12] <Kcko> Cr0vaX setInterval, Ajax ...
[15:37:31] <Cr0vaX> ty
[15:37:40] <Cr0vaX> will google it
[15:38:47] <KWhat_Work> Anyone familiar with the _on methods?]
[15:39:13] <zfly9> shoky, thanks but the code isn't telling it to do anything when the mouse leaves hover
[15:39:16] <zfly9> and that's what I want
[15:40:25] <Already> zfly9 what should revertFlip do? It doesn't even work when i call it for sure?!
[15:41:40] <Already> err nevermind. My mistake.
[15:41:51] <zfly9> It should revert the thing back to the front side
[15:43:38] <shoky> zfly9: that's how you use hover for both mouse enter and mouse-leave. but the mouse-enter is being called again and again because that .flip plugin keeps hiding/showing the actual element
[15:43:56] <shoky> zfly9: you pass .hover two function arguments. read the docs
[15:44:22] <Already> Even if you do because the mouse-enter is called again and again it can't revert it seems.
[15:44:58] <zfly9> so confused, sorry I'm a noob to this, anyway don't want to bug you guys anymore I'm sure it's aggravating
[15:45:45] <Already> It should work like this, but it doesn't probably because of what shoky said. http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/6/
[15:47:46] <zfly9> oh alright, well thanks for your help Already
[15:48:47] <Already> NP. Gn8 everyone.
[15:57:43] <MrPunkin> is there any way to store namespaced data without having it referenced back to a specific object?
[16:08:20] <ShawnRisk> how do I tell which page I am on and make sure the menu and submenus know that.  If I click on the menu item About Us under Help, how do I tell the page I am on that page?  I know I have to add class="active"; to that, but not sure how.
[16:12:33] <upmauro> http://dpaste.com/815267/ ... html() returns '', what the problem ?
[16:16:09] <KWhat_Work> upmauro: what did you expect it to return
[16:22:37] <razzi> KWhat_Work, what were you trying to do?
[16:23:10] <razzi> KWhat_Work, an img tag has no html
[16:24:50] <KWhat_Work> razzi: that should be directed at upmauro
[16:25:03] <KWhat_Work> he hasn't responded yet
[16:25:17] <razzi> oh sorry
[16:25:22] <razzi> upmauro*

[16:31:47] <mike_papa> How can I split element (div) into two basing on some condition? I mean if condition of child is met, I want to end parent element, and start another one which contains the rest of original parent.
[16:32:12] <TelFiRE> if I have a drag n drop item, how do I stop it from highlighting stuff on the page
[16:33:19] <mike_papa> I tried simply $('</div><div class="parent">').insertAfter(child), but something doesn't want to end parent's div and skips '</div>' part
[16:44:07] <ShawnRisk> How come this code: $( "#topnav a" ).each( function () { if(url == $(this).attr('href')) { $(this).find("div").show(); } } ) will not be correct?  All I want to do is match the URL to the a href in the link elements within #topnav.
[16:45:26] <SrPx> Can I load a site (ie: google) inside a div on my site?
[16:49:09] <ThumperHome> Which jQuery function replaces the contents of the element, and returns a reference to the new element?
[16:50:58] <MrPunkin> Anyone have a clever way of matching a set of URL regex expressions against the current one, or mapping URL patterns to named objects such as 'photo-page'?
[16:51:30] <ThumperHome> Or i'll just .contents("") and .appendTo()
[16:54:50] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can answer my question.
[16:55:48] <r1card> I want to move an element up/down (i.e back / forward in DOM, not visually) relative to its siblings.
[16:55:57] <r1card> What would be the shortest way?
[16:59:04] <Styles> What is $() exactly
[16:59:44] <ThumperHome> Calling jQuery with no parameters
[16:59:50] <ThumperHome> Still returns a jQuery object
[17:01:08] <ThumperHome> r1card: insertBefore() insertAfter()
[17:01:29] <Styles> I got it so $ is short for jQuery specifically and $() is a css selector
[17:01:39] <ThumperHome> No
[17:01:53] <ThumperHome> Yes $ is short-hand for jQuery
[17:02:12] <ThumperHome> $ is a function
[17:02:24] <ThumperHome> you call a function by: functionName()
[17:02:30] <r1card> thujone_, thanks
[17:02:43] <ThumperHome> functionName(parameter)
[17:02:56] <ThumperHome> $() is calling $ / jQuery with no parameters
[17:03:17] <ThumperHome> $("#id") is passing "#id" string to jQuery function
[17:03:51] <r1card> ThumperHome, not working quite :P
[17:03:54] <Styles> yeah gotcha
[17:04:31] <ThumperHome> When it receives a string that it knows is a css selector, it will search the DOM using that selector
[17:04:54] <ThumperHome> But it can receive a string like $("<div/>"), which jQuery knows is not a css selector (it creates a new element)
[17:05:16] <ThumperHome> r1card: Html like: <div><a><b><c></div> ?
[17:05:30] <ThumperHome> $("b").insertBefore("a");
[17:05:50] <r1card> ThumperHome, I think I got the order wrong, testing thanka
[17:05:52] <r1card> thanks
[17:06:28] <r1card> ThumperHome, which item is the "inserted" one
[17:06:31] <r1card> b or a?
[17:07:02] <ThumperHome> b
[17:08:38] <r1card> ThumperHome, well I'm failing at this big time.
[17:08:48] <r1card> I want to move an item one back, one forward.
[17:08:56] <r1card> I select all items.
[17:09:04] <r1card> loop, try to find which is the current one by index.
[17:09:24] <r1card> then I increment/decrement the index and try to insert after that element, or if 0, before
[17:09:28] <r1card> And I get random stuff.
[17:09:37] <scarlet_razor> HI..... good morning.. alll
[17:09:55] <scarlet_razor> how to get spesific value with jquery ui dropable
[17:09:55] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/hUc6B/1/
[17:10:28] <jack7849> I have the following line: console.log(result.getData());      this gives me back an Object in the firefox console that has the property "yaxis", but I can't get any deeper, like result.getData().yaxis is undefined,, how can i access it properly?
[17:11:02] <r1card> ThumperHome, how do I select previous sibling / next sibling, the syntax is unclear
[17:13:59] <scarlet_razor> hello... can someone please guide me... :)
[17:16:32] <jack7849> oh i found it, had to add [0] so it becomes .getData()[0]
[17:16:54] <r1card> ThumperHome, figured it out, next() /prev() thanks for your help it helped me
[17:19:27] <ThumperHome> r1card: I can make a simple demo for you if you want
[17:25:56] <pixeltarian> can anyone, by looking at this, tell me if it seems possible to get the date to format like this?  EG:  10/18/12 - 7:30pm
[17:26:10] <pixeltarian> thing to look at: http://sugi.github.com/jquery-gcal-flow/
[17:28:16] <rmurphey> pixeltarian: using moment.js and the date_formatter option of that plugin, you can probably achieve what you want
[17:28:21] <rmurphey> http://momentjs.com/
[17:28:46] <pixeltarian> cool. thanks, I'll give it a shot
[17:30:52] <scarlet_razor> mmmm.... how to get value from jquery ui dropable to process with ajax http://jsfiddle.net/hUc6B/1/

[17:40:38] <ThumperHome> If i can, ask
[17:40:57] <ThumperHome> :)

[17:41:32] <ryanneufeld> scarlet_razor: I've done that
[17:41:40] <scarlet_razor> how ?
[17:41:57] <rsumi> ThumperHome: good enough for me :)
[17:42:00] <scarlet_razor> any fiddle...
[17:42:14] <ryanneufeld> scarlet_razor: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[17:42:40] <black_warlock> guys
[17:42:44] <black_warlock> who goes there ?
[17:44:03] <rsumi> ThumperHome: oh wait, i want to actually not make the link look like like a link while it's disabled
[17:44:15] <rsumi> ThumperHome: not just stop it's default action from happening
[17:44:38] <rsumi> i don't want the pointer there or it's normal link actions
[17:44:43] <scarlet_razor> ryannefeld ... thanks u sooo much... ... i check it out... :)
[17:45:37] <ThumperHome> rsumi: You probably want to add the css you require
[17:46:01] <ThumperHome> Such as $("a").css({ text-decoration: "none" })
[17:46:16] <ThumperHome> ups that won't work
[17:46:27] <ThumperHome> Correct: $("a").css({ "text-decoration": "none" })
[17:47:00] <rsumi> got it
[17:47:01] <rsumi> thanks!
[17:47:07] <ThumperHome> You can add as much key/values as you want in the format $().css({ k: v, k: v })
[17:47:08] <ThumperHome> np
[17:49:28] <ThumperHome> scarlet_razor: Your demo is not working
[17:49:50] <ThumperHome> You can try var title = $(ui.draggable).attr("title")
[17:50:05] <ThumperHome> (Before deleting the image, not sure what is happening in your demo)
[17:51:05] <ThumperHome> Then in your Ajax request you would do $.ajax({ ... data: { title: title } ... })
[17:51:17] <ThumperHome> uff wrong again
[17:51:29] <ThumperHome> $.ajax({ ... data: "{ title: title }" ... })
[17:52:04] <scarlet_razor> oh.. thank... your advice...
[17:52:19] <scarlet_razor> i copy your comment to try it.. on my server
[17:52:29] <ThumperHome> And again... : $.ajax({ ... data: "{ title: " + title + " }" ... })
[17:52:54] <ThumperHome> I am pretty sure "data" property value must be a JSON string
[18:00:55] <Kaltezar> Hi ! Is there some constraints on the url provided to $.getJSON() ?
[18:02:23] <ThumperHome> Kaltezar: Probably
[18:02:38] <ThumperHome> $.ajax({  url: url,  dataType: 'jsonp' });
[18:02:44] <ThumperHome> That should work cross-site
[18:03:16] <ThumperHome> Well I might be wrong
[18:05:55] <Kaltezar> If I set the url to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/', it doesn't work. I'm sure that the json returned from this URL is correct ‚Ä¶ Maybe it can accept specifying server port ?
[18:11:46] <codephobic> hi
[18:12:26] <codephobic> I'm trying to check a value returned via ajax and set within a php script, within jquery. Is this possible and if so, any ideas/pointers as to how?
[18:14:06] <codephobic> basically, I've run a database check against a username entered in a form (via ajax), now I want to be able to prevent the user submitting the form if that database check states that the username is already present.
[18:14:07] <Kaltezar> Ok ‚Ä¶ finally got it. This is the "Same origin policy" ‚Ä¶ look like I will have to make a proxy up :x
[18:15:36] <ThumperHome> Kaltezar
[18:15:50] <ThumperHome> dataType: "jsonp" should work cross site
[18:17:05] <Kaltezar> Yes, I read it ‚Ä¶ but some people are saying that using jsonp to workaround the rule can lead to security problems
[18:17:17] <ThumperHome> What?
[18:17:31] <ThumperHome> Security server-side, yeah
[18:18:38] <ThumperHome> More like, "this service can be used by clients on all sites"
[18:19:56] <ThumperHome> If you are offering non-sensitive data I don't see any problem
[18:22:06] <Kaltezar> Thanks for the precision, I will think about it
[18:30:22] <scarlet_razor> sorry ThumperHome seem like i had some problem again
[18:30:28] <scarlet_razor> the title is undefined
[18:30:29] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/hUc6B/2/
[18:31:05] <scarlet_razor> is there something wrong with typo... i dont really know
[18:35:40] <codephobic> nevermind, sorted it out.
[18:38:05] <black_warlock> hewloz
[18:38:57] <black_warlock> who can tell me why i cant see one bar on internet explorer ?
[18:39:13] <black_warlock> its jq script
[18:39:51] <black_warlock> i can see the website fine in all browsers less IE
[18:40:10] <oojacoboo> can someone please tell me why I wouldn't be able to reach "made it 2" here‚Ä¶ https://gist.github.com/3915791
[18:40:24] <oojacoboo> the url is good...
[18:40:59] <oojacoboo> the json is validated as well
[18:41:05] <black_warlock> why dont you load success:
[18:41:30] <scarlet_razor> how to get title as being dragged http://jsfiddle.net/hUc6B/2/
[18:41:55] <scarlet_razor> sorry title that has dropped on ListOne box
[18:42:13] <oojacoboo> black_warlock: I'm not aware that's necessary
[18:42:59] <scarlet_razor> i update the fiddle...
[18:43:01] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/pxeHT/18/
[18:43:08] <black_warlock> you must get ui scarlet_razor
[18:43:15] <scarlet_razor> can anyone check
[18:44:00] <scarlet_razor> i make it seem too much code black_warlock
[18:44:02] <black_warlock> it works
[18:44:15] <scarlet_razor> i change it to http://jsfiddle.net/pxeHT/18/ for being readable
[18:44:19] <oojacoboo> black_warlock: also, is data avail in the success callback?
[18:44:24] <scarlet_razor> what dou u mean it works ?
[18:45:00] <black_warlock> whats the problem in that script
[18:45:14] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/pxeHT/18/ how to get title value ?
[18:45:58] <black_warlock> andwhere is titile
[18:46:33] <black_warlock> ah
[18:46:35] <black_warlock> ok
[18:46:38] <scarlet_razor> on the list two
[18:46:40] <black_warlock> you get title like this
[18:47:09] <black_warlock> $('img').attr('title')
[18:47:55] <black_warlock> when you want alert title ?
[18:48:10] <black_warlock> when you drop in items ?
[18:48:21] <scarlet_razor> when it dropped...
[18:48:53] <scarlet_razor> so i would create var title = $('img').attr('title') ;
[18:48:55] <scarlet_razor> right ?
[18:52:20] <jilaspodi> wtf ?
[18:55:09] <ThumperHome> scarlet_razor: yeah
[18:55:22] <ThumperHome> but replace 'img'
[18:55:29] <ThumperHome> with ui.draggable
[18:55:58] <ThumperHome> That should return the draggable element you moved around
[18:56:44] <scarlet_razor> ThumperHome u seem absolutely right...
[18:56:46] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/pxeHT/24/
[18:56:47] <scarlet_razor> it works
[18:57:05] <scarlet_razor> but im not understand if i implement it with my own code....
[18:57:10] <scarlet_razor> btw thank :)
[18:57:59] <infid> ajax calls shouldn't show up as "waiting for <ip>" in the browser status bar right?
[18:59:35] <jilaspodi> here it is scarlet_razor
[18:59:52] <jilaspodi> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/pxeHT/27/
[19:00:00] <jilaspodi> but some doesnt have title
[19:00:12] <jilaspodi> if doesnt have it says undefined
[19:00:16] <oojacoboo> anyone?
[19:00:23] <oojacoboo> https://gist.github.com/3915791
[19:00:34] <oojacoboo> "made it 2" doesn't get called but "made it" does
[19:00:38] <oojacoboo> how does that make sense?
[19:00:39] <scarlet_razor> jilaspodi.. i fork it thank :)
[19:00:52] <black_warlock> remember
[19:01:04] <black_warlock> in the sortable and draggable ui the items are ui.item
[19:01:42] <scarlet_razor> nice info...
[19:01:51] <scarlet_razor> so it's not ui.draggable
[19:01:54] <scarlet_razor> but ui.item
[19:02:22] <black_warlock> depend
[19:02:35] <black_warlock> ui.item.sortable and ui.item.draggable
[19:03:11] <black_warlock> also
[19:03:21] <scarlet_razor> yeah ?
[19:04:07] <black_warlock> instead to write $(this) you write ui.item
[19:05:12] <black_warlock> how can we test that script oojacoboo ?
[19:05:14] <scarlet_razor> so i need to change  var $title = $(ui.draggable).attr("title"); to  var $title = $(ui.item.draggable).attr("title");
[19:05:27] <black_warlock> no
[19:05:36] <oojacoboo> black_warlock: not sure what's to test
[19:05:42] <bung> for anyone familiar with firebug, why does it not tell you where a missing image is being requested from in your source, it just shows the 404, or do i need to look somewhere specific?
[19:06:06] <oojacoboo> I have no idea how the second log function wouldn't write
[19:08:12] <coldhead> lieu*
[19:13:34] <crankharder> what class gets applied to the currently dragged item w/ the sortable widget
[19:21:08] <oojacoboo> wow, this is the most obnoxious thing I've had to deal with in a _long_ time
[19:22:13] <scarlet_razor> mmm... it seem not going back ... how to create the dragable can be turn back http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/b2htN/1/
[19:27:36] <oojacoboo> ok, so, the issue is a parse error, since I was able to get this from the $.ajax function error handler
[19:27:52] <oojacoboo> why would jquery have a parse error for JSON that passes the lint test?
[19:28:45] <oojacoboo> ZOMG copy paste failed me ><
[19:28:48] <oojacoboo> I need a beer
[19:36:09] <coldhead> totally justified
[19:46:22] <scarlet_razor> hi... people sory for asking again.. how to make the dragable returnable http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/b2htN/1/
[20:03:49] <black_warlock> scarlet there?
[20:05:08] <oojacoboo> If I'm accessing in a json file, something like‚Ä¶ "foo": [whatever, yep, array]; why to I get typeof === object?
[20:05:18] <oojacoboo> would that not be an array, or do I have to parse that somehow?
[20:10:45] <black_warlock> depend
[20:10:50] <black_warlock> from many things
[20:11:01] <black_warlock> it should be anything
[20:11:42] <black_warlock> amd you have to read documentationabout json
[20:12:34] <black_warlock> sometimes also version can block the excution of your code
[20:17:00] <thinkerweb> does display:none work on <ul> elements?
[20:18:53] <black_warlock> ofc
[20:19:31] <black_warlock> usually you have to set display none on the second ul
[20:20:12] <black_warlock> $('ul ul').css('display','none');
[20:20:14] <thinkerweb> its not working for me
[20:20:30] <thinkerweb> i gave it a class name $('.classname').
[20:20:31] <black_warlock> what the id or class of ul ?
[20:20:56] <black_warlock> have jsfiddle ?
[20:21:07] <thinkerweb> oops, it does work, I had a typo, nevermind sorry, thx
[20:21:23] <black_warlock> :P
[20:22:52] <black_warlock> gnight alllz
[20:24:11] <thinkerweb> I wanna select $(this).parent().child().child(), IE the second child, is this the best way?
[20:27:25] <thinkerweb> or .child().next()
[20:42:42] <oojacoboo> If I'm accessing in a json file, something like‚Ä¶ "foo": [whatever, yep, array]; why to I get typeof === object?
[20:42:44] <oojacoboo> would that not be an array, or do I have to parse that somehow?
[20:44:52] <oojacoboo> yea, so an array is an object in js ><
[20:45:15] <oojacoboo> I swear every lang I deal with has type issues
[20:45:17] <coldhead> ?eval typeof [1,2,10]
[20:45:21] <bot-t> coldhead: "object"
[20:45:27] <coldhead> danke, bot-t
[20:45:53] <coldhead> oojacoboo: can you ignore the specific type?
[20:45:59] <coldhead> and get on with your life?
[20:46:21] <oojacoboo> coldhead: I was just trying to see what it was b/c $.inArray keeps returning true when it should return false
[20:46:31] <oojacoboo> it'd be nice to actually know what it is
[20:46:53] <oojacoboo> since that means it could be a bool date error etc
[20:47:30] <oojacoboo> I guess I need to check the class
[20:48:24] <thinkerweb> $(this).next().animate({'opacity': '1'}); is failing for me
[20:48:37] <tw2113> coldhead, i finally found my chance to use data attributes
[20:49:07] <oojacoboo> thinkerweb: testcase?
[20:49:13] <oojacoboo> ?testcase
[20:49:13] <bot-t> http://xkr.us/js/testcase

[21:08:47] <scar> tw2113: learning ajax? :D
[21:08:59] <tw2113> that too
[21:09:09] <tw2113> i have some good challenges involving ajax coming up soon
[21:09:15] <scar> such as?
[21:09:49] <Richhh> is using jquery faster than writing onclick="func()" etc in html?
[21:09:55] <tw2113> doing a wordpress search on a page with a slider, and then inserting the results back into the slider
[21:10:12] <scar> tw2113: how so? search box inside the slider?
[21:10:20] <tw2113> good questions :)
[21:11:09] <coldhead> Richhh: yes
[21:11:21] <tw2113> cleaner too Richhh
[21:13:21] <Richhh> ty
[21:26:37] <Kitu> hello
[21:28:11] <Kitu> I generate an image degraded by a php ajax request which is intended to serve as a background for an html element in IE (since it does not take into account the gradient css). And then everything works fine except that the cover image IE takes into account only the first image, the image changes well, but he will not get it, how to go and fetch it?
[21:29:15] <coldhead> Kitu: it might be the cache
[21:29:25] <Kitu> the cache yes
[21:29:25] <coldhead> try adding a randomstring to the end of the image URL
[21:29:39] <coldhead> ?eval Math.random() or something
[21:29:40] <Kitu> for css ?
[21:29:40] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[21:29:44] <coldhead> ?eval Math.random() // or something
[21:29:45] <bot-t> coldhead: 0.26552237356273334
[21:29:52] <coldhead> no that won't work in CSS
[21:30:02] <coldhead> in that case you can either do it with JS
[21:30:11] <coldhead> OR you can fix your server settings so it doesn't get cached
[21:31:01] <Richhh> i want to dynamically generate a list of 0-200 (usually around 25-50) divs (which can then be individually removed). what is the best function to use for this list generation (eg append()? html()? innerhtml()?
[21:31:04] <Kitu> how with JS coldhead ?
[21:31:44] <Kitu> I don't find JS refresh element function
[21:32:49] <Kitu> my css is already load with JS
[21:33:13] <Kitu> but the image doesn't change
[21:33:40] <coldhead> Kitu: $('div').css('background-image', '/lol/bg.php?' + Math.random());
[21:33:49] <coldhead> OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT
[21:33:56] <beachandbytes> Richh I would generate them as an html string and insert at once
[21:34:05] <Kitu> ah
[21:34:11] <Kitu> I test
[21:34:12] <Richhh> beachandbytes insert using which function
[21:34:15] <coldhead> beachandbytes++
[21:34:20] <Richhh> .html()?
[21:34:31] <coldhead> Richhh: it doesn't matter which you use, so long as you try to do it all in one hit
[21:34:32] <beachandbytes> prepend, append
[21:34:40] <Richhh> ok
[21:34:47] <coldhead> build a giantic html string and then stick it in the dom in one go
[21:34:56] <Richhh> got it
[21:34:56] <Richhh> ty
[21:35:00] <coldhead> good luck!
[21:35:03] <Richhh> cheers
[21:35:03] <Richhh> :)
[21:36:20] <Kitu> very good coldhead thanks
[21:36:42] <scarlet_razor> hi... how to return dragable object http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/pxeHT/28/
[21:38:03] <Kitu> but it does'nt work on ie8, ie9 only
[21:39:44] <ZGirl> Is there a way to bind an event handler to an already-initialized jquery ui element? I have a component that I'd like to keep decoupled from the code that initializes the autocomplete. Thanks!
[21:40:51] <coldhead> that is bizarre, Kitu
[21:41:08] <coldhead> if you are requesting a different url that should reload the image in ALL browsers
[21:41:33] <coldhead> (i thought recent IE had gradients anyway :)
[21:41:51] <Kitu> it's maybe another thing that does'nt work, i'm goging to see
[21:42:02] <coldhead> you know the only time i ever have to think about IE these days is when i am helping you spazmos
[21:43:43] <tw2113> :D
[21:44:06] <tw2113> once i moved more to plugin dev instead of theme dev in wordpress, i got to ditch IE testing too
[21:44:28] <scarlet_razor> anyone can please check how to doing returnable drag ?
[21:44:30] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/pxeHT/28/
[21:44:55] <coldhead> i would love to help scarlet_razor but it's pretty much my first day using jQ UI
[21:45:31] <scarlet_razor> that's find.. i just learning too...
[21:45:37] <tw2113> ready for your jquery UI quiz coldhead ?
[21:46:02] <scarlet_razor> i just print the JQ ui book, but got a puzzle to solve soon....
[21:47:41] <tw2113> aha, that's what i should do
[21:48:03] <tw2113> instead of trying to get work done tomorrow on the plane, i should just read jquery fundamentals or whatever site it is run by rmurphey
[21:51:10] <tw2113> well, bocoup training now, from the looks of it
[21:51:53] <coldhead> who employ rmurphey
[21:51:57] <coldhead> so it's all good
[21:52:16] <tw2113> yup
[21:53:48] <tw2113> i wonder if the plane will have wifi
[21:54:15] <ni_> hello
[21:55:11] <coldhead> where you flying, tw2113?
[21:55:24] <tw2113> Philadelphia till wednesday
[21:57:02] <coldhead> neat!
[21:57:07] <coldhead> phillllllly
[21:57:49] <coldhead> so wednesday should be just time enough to take your phill
[21:57:51] <coldhead> AHAHAHAHHAHA
[21:57:52] <coldhead> >: |
[21:58:59] <Kitu> yes, it's good, some css properties did shit ...
[21:59:59] <coldhead> >: |
[22:00:05] <coldhead> good debugging, Kitu !
[22:00:12] <coldhead> why don't you take a break
[22:00:44] <Kitu> yes :)
[22:01:33] <Kitu> I do a customization for apparences of my forum engine
[22:01:44] <Kitu> with excolor
[22:02:09] <Kitu> to create graphics themes easily
[22:20:26] <tipdbmp> I dynamicly apppend an '<img>' after a '<p>' but only if '<img>' hasn't been already appended. I am using $('p').next().get(0).tagName.toLowerCase() == 'img' to check if has been appended, but the problem (as far as I can tell) is that.next() always returns the static element that apears after the '<p>', and not the dynamic one I added.
[22:23:17] <scar> if i have a form with NO SUBMIT button or input, but im in a textbox-- i hit enter and it refreshes the page. how can i prevent the default action of a form without a submit button? can you prevent default action of a form? i assumed you would need to do it to the submit button
[22:23:23] <Cork> tipdbmp: no .next() returns the next dom element
[22:23:37] <Cork> tipdbmp: dom doesn't care when something was added, as long as its in dom
[22:24:11] <tipdbmp> Okay, but what should I use then?
[22:24:12] <Cork> tipdbmp: and you can just do $('p').next('img').length > 0
[22:24:44] <Cork> btw i hope your not using $('p') in your real code
[22:24:51] <Cork> cause that won't work
[22:25:08] <tipdbmp> I am just tinkering, yes.
[22:25:25] <Cork> (it would just check after the first p in the page, and ignore all other)
[22:25:52] <tipdbmp> Good enough for testing stuff out =).
[22:26:09] <tipdbmp> But anyway, how can I access the next element?
[22:26:29] <Cork> scar: its the from that does it, not the button
[22:26:38] <Cork> scar: bind a submit event and preventDefault
[22:26:46] <Cork> tipdbmp: like i showed you
[22:27:06] <tipdbmp> Okay, will try it.
[22:27:26] <Cork> if that doesn't work it sounds like you haven't added the element to dom yet
[22:27:41] <Cork> so if that doesn't work provide a testcase
[22:27:44] <Cork> ?demo
[22:27:44] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:28:31] <Cork> (the fiddle is definitely preferred)
[22:33:04] <tipdbmp> Well it doesn't work because it can't access the images =), but anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/p8jPF/
[22:41:43] <Cork> tipdbmp: http://jsfiddle.net/p8jPF/2/
[22:41:53] <Cork> whats it suppose to do when it "works" ?
[22:42:36] <Cork> ah
[22:42:44] <Cork> i see where your going wrong
[22:43:04] <Cork> tipdbmp: http://jsfiddle.net/p8jPF/3/
[22:43:14] <Cork> append appends the img inside the selected element
[22:43:25] <Cork> you want after if you want to look for it with .next
[22:48:05] <tipdbmp> I see, tnx =)
[22:48:14] <Cork> np
[23:19:06] <phrearch>  /join #express
[23:19:20] <phrearch> oops
[23:19:35] <coldhead> almost!
[23:19:52] <coldhead> sup juha_
[23:21:44] <juha_> i have an problem with unbind
[23:33:46] <coldhead> ?die @ juha_
[23:33:47] <bot-t> juha_, .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[23:36:05] <iaj> Hi there...   What's the appropriate way to have a select box on a page, lets say select#bar and when the selection here gets to anything other than "foo" I want to call jQuery('.hideMePleaseThen').hide() and if its value is "foo" again have jQuery('.hideMePleaseThen').show() ?
[23:37:12] <iaj> value "foo" is default here
[23:38:33] <faraway> iaj: listen to the change event of the select box .. and there you can check if foo is selected and do the required action
[23:39:41] <Cork> iaj: you need to listen for keypress too though
[23:39:53] <Cork> else if breaks if ppl change though the keyboard
[23:39:54] <juha_> coldhead: i'm trying to bind un to #finland but it keeps failing
[23:40:32] <Cork> select.change(function(){}).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.change(); }, 0); }); is a little trick to make that work smoothly
[23:41:02] <iaj> faraway: so I'd use the $('select#bar').change( ‚Ä¶ ) ?
[23:41:08] <iaj> ah thanks Cork , thanks faraway
[23:41:11] <iaj> gonna try it :)
[23:41:13] <coldhead> juha_: if you have any messages for the UN please let me know and i will pass them on
[23:41:24] <faraway> Cork: oh ok .. didn't know that will the change event never be fired or only on blur then ?
[23:41:28] <juha_> coldhead: can you please check my code, it should be correct: http://jsfiddle.net/PjtaY/
[23:41:34] <Cork> faraway: exactly
[23:41:43] <faraway> Cork: good to know :D
[23:41:49] <Cork> only on blur that is
[23:41:57] <Cork> (and mouse click)
[23:42:10] <coldhead> this is great juha_ . works for me
[23:42:13] <iaj> Cork: hmmm... woah.. I dunno where to put my stuff there
[23:42:23] <coldhead> i can include jQuery for you but it'll cost you a viking helmet
[23:42:43] <juha_> coldhead: weird, i can't seem to get it to bind to un
[23:43:01] <Cork> iaj: its event listeners, you bind them after the element has been added to the page, that about the only rule
[23:44:06] <coldhead> like i said, juha_, i can pass messages to the UN for you
[23:44:12] <coldhead> what do you want to do about syria?
[23:44:19] <coldhead> oh wait you don't have a vote
[23:44:20] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[23:44:35] <coldhead> your opinions are important to us etc
[23:47:36] <juha_> but basically i'm dead yo you, that's what you're saying right
[23:55:19] <iaj> Cork: thanks got it working:)
[23:55:32] <Cork> nice
[23:59:08] <iaj> My next question would be, I ought to make a well.. a form on top of a page, which should be shown automatically... (rest faded out somehow I'm sure you guys know what I mean) ‚Ä¶ Is there some resources I could look into?
[23:59:29] <iaj> eg. a form that you need to 'X' away before you can really see the actual website
