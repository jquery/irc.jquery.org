[00:01:10] <vlad27aug> prefixed: try and wrap the code in a setTimeout to see if it is because the code is executed before the actual style attribute is set
[00:01:15] <raj> Cork, not a demo, but http://paste.ofcode.org/aCXcsQTjD7VzAbBvmnHaxw
[00:01:23] <vlad27aug> and if that's the case look for where the style is set
[00:01:26] <vlad27aug> and go from there
[00:01:34] <raj> and $cloned_div ends up being the changed appearance
[00:01:50] <Eviltwin> This is fun: http://jsfiddle.net/WUgTP/
[00:01:52] <raj> when I console.log it
[00:01:56] <Eviltwin> (Click and drag in the preview)
[00:02:16] <raj> Eviltwin, very nice man
[00:02:18] <raj> did you make that?
[00:02:24] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[00:02:28] <raj> very nice
[00:02:52] <Cork> raj: your sure you want parent('.vote') ?
[00:02:59] <Cork> and not closest('.vote') ?
[00:03:20] <raj> it would result in the same element
[00:03:25] <Cork> k
[00:03:53] <Cork> so basically $cloned_div should be an empty selector unless the parent has the class?
[00:04:15] <raj> right
[00:05:06] <vlad27aug> prefixed: http://jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/#jPlayer-events
[00:05:18] <prefixed> vlad27aug I found it
[00:05:18] <Cork> could you test with saving $target.parent('.vote') in its own variable?
[00:05:26] <vlad27aug> maybe you can set a handler for the ready event
[00:05:27] <prefixed> vlad27aug it is set late rin the code
[00:05:42] <Cork> raj: and then clone it, and see if both contain the same dom when your done
[00:05:50] <prefixed> I am using an older version of the player as well http://www.jplayer.org/1.2.0/developer-guide/#jPlayer-setFile
[00:06:11] <Cork> raj: other then that no i can't say why that would happen, it looks like it should work (and i've used similar code my self)
[00:06:20] <Cork> not with parent/closest though
[00:06:31] <nights> wow
[00:06:31] <raj> Cork, even if I use .closest('.vote').clone(), and then I change the original .vote's contents, the clone looks like the changed element
[00:06:35] <nights> business is picking up speed
[00:06:39] <nights> 3 orders today already
[00:06:41] <nights> yey!
[00:07:28] <Cork> raj: i meant: $vote = $target.parent('.vote'); $cloned_div = $vote.clone(); ..... console.log($vote); console.log($cloned_div);
[00:07:42] <raj> k
[00:07:46] <raj> checking...
[00:08:00] <Cork> can't see why they would differ, but...
[00:08:12] <Cork> (from what your doing now)
[00:08:59] <raj> Cork, they're the same
[00:09:08] <Cork> weird
[00:09:10] <raj> and in both cases, they are the changed div
[00:09:14] <raj> with the - Thanks! and all
[00:09:40] <Cork> oh, ya one more test
[00:10:09] <Cork> before you do anything try $cloned_div[0] == $target.parent('.vote')[0]
[00:10:32] <Cork> that should be false, or things are not cloning at all
[00:11:55] <raj> false
[00:12:05] <Cork> ...
[00:12:34] <raj> why isn't it cloning?
[00:12:46] <Cork> it is cloning
[00:12:57] <raj> oh
[00:12:59] <raj> ok
[00:13:05] <raj> right
[00:13:08] <raj> so now what?
[00:13:11] <Cork> and $target.parent()[0] == $target.parent('.vote')[0] is ?
[00:13:48] <raj> truew
[00:13:49] <raj> true
[00:14:12] <Cork> ok, can't say anymore without testing, this makes no sense
[00:14:20] <raj> hmm k
[00:17:58] <raj> ok, it's cuz on the second click, it's reassessing the $target
[00:18:14] <raj> i didn't realize that somehow
[00:20:13] <raj> nope, that didn't solve it either
[00:28:48] <k1t> hey folks, sorry if this is slightly off topic but i was wondering a decent way to re-write the following loop for (var i=0, file; file=o.files[i]; i++)
[00:33:33] <nand_> hi can i post a model using ajax post method ?, i am using mvc3 razor view engine please help me i am new in jquery
[00:34:27] <raj> nand_, what's posting a model mean?
[00:35:32] <nand_> i have a model that is used to bind the text fields in the form
[00:35:48] <raj> what's a model?
[00:36:05] <sacredchao> raj, thats asp.net MVC
[00:36:19] <raj> oh
[00:36:22] <raj> so db stuff?
[00:37:22] <nand_> ok model is a class contain properties or simply hold data, i am using mvc 3 achitecture
[00:37:43] <nand_> yes asp.net mvc3
[00:38:25] <sacredchao> you have to serialize your object somehow
[00:38:27] <raj> it has a javascript plugin or something that automatically renders it?
[00:38:31] <sacredchao> like, express it in json
[00:39:16] <raj> otherwise, I don't see what your db models have to do with jquery
[00:39:28] <sacredchao> raj, they don't
[00:39:34] <sacredchao> nand_, ask in ##asp.net :)
[00:39:52] <nand_> ok , thanks
[00:40:02] <raj> sacredchao, what's the jquery connection though?
[00:40:09] <raj> that led him to ask here in the first place?
[00:40:15] <raj> out of curiosity
[00:40:44] <sacredchao> raj, on the View (Client) side you use jquery for xhr stuff and so on
[00:41:06] <raj> oh, to add data?
[00:41:21] <raj> hmm, seems pretty disconnected
[00:41:26] <raj> even still
[00:42:24] <raj> so you can't post a model though
[00:42:28] <raj> anyway
[00:43:15] <sacredchao> well you can if you serialize it... but the _model_ itself is on the server side, most likely ORM from DB
[00:43:28] <raj> right
[00:43:38] <Takyoji> I'm having issues with using nested .each() functions: http://pastebin.com/hL2VWAx0
[00:43:39] <raj> that's what I mean
[00:43:45] <sacredchao> yeah
[00:44:09] <raj> Takyoji, what's wrong?
[00:44:22] <BakaOu> hi
[00:44:52] <BakaOu> May I make a request ?
[00:45:02] <sacredchao> only POST and DELETE, please
[00:45:15] <Takyoji> In the nested .each() function, the variable 'option' (a parameter of the nested .each() function), equals the parent element (which is an <optgroup> tag, not the <option> tag as desired).
[00:46:14] <Takyoji> 'optgroup' should be a <optgroup> element, 'option' should be a <option> element, but is the parent <optgroup> element instead.
[00:46:28] <jetienne> q. i got 2 selections and i want to "join" them, how can i 2 that ?
[00:46:43] <sacredchao> BakaOu, yes you may, don't ask to ask :)
[00:46:48] <Takyoji> Sorry if my case is a bit confusing
[00:47:19] <Ziber> Easy way with JQuery to append to text that's current in an element? $("#element").appendText() or something?
[00:48:03] <ajpiano> Ziber: $("#element").text(function(i, text) { return text + "more Text"; });
[00:48:03] <raj> Takyoji, looks okay to me, you need tier 2 tech support, osrry
[00:48:07] <xec_> Takyoji: inside the first loop, "optgroup" is going to be a single element
[00:48:08] <raj> *sorry
[00:48:32] <xec_> Takyoji: and then you're trying to loop on this single element?
[00:48:38] <Ziber> ajpiano: Hm, okay thanks
[00:48:55] <Takyoji> oh, I see the problem
[00:49:05] <BakaOu> Can you access this urls : https://www.fast-debrid.com/  and www.alldebrid.com ?
[00:49:20] <Takyoji> Basically I'm trying to iterate <optgroup> elements, and for each <optgroup> element, to iterate the contained <option> elements
[00:49:27] <BakaOu> are they loading ?
[00:49:28] <Takyoji> But yes, I see the error in my logic now
[00:50:04] <Eshu> Takyoji: you want's to create Matrix Array
[00:50:06] <Takyoji> Would I just do $(optgroup).children().each(function() {...}), or?
[00:50:15] <Takyoji> or however the API is
[00:50:20] <Onesime> hello
[00:50:33] <xec_> Takyoji: yeah that should work
[00:50:36] <Eshu> Onesime: Hey
[00:51:18] <xec_> Takyoji: and as a sidenote, "a" is already the current index, no need to make your own "i" manually
[00:54:02] <Takyoji> alright, works as desired, thanks for the advice.
[00:55:54] <sacredchao> BakaOu, use downforeveryoneorjustme.com to find that out
[00:56:54] <xec_> ?ask @ Onesime
[00:56:55] <bot-t> Onesime, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:59:31] <Onesime> ok, if I had to ^^ i come from mootools, so i'm used to overload some functions. I guess it's possible with jquery ?
[01:10:06] <Takyoji> Is there any straightforward approach to adding children elements to an element?
[01:11:19] <Takyoji> Or should I just create each child, append the HTML of them all together as a single string, and then create the parent element whereas the innerHTML is the HTML of all the child elements?
[01:13:24] <Zhy> despite its ugliness I'd go for that solution. Dunno bout alternatives =/
[01:13:31] <Takyoji> alright
[01:13:47] <Takyoji> It's probably the quickest solution as well
[01:13:56] <Ziber> Alright, I've got a function appending text to what's already there. But it won't insert line breaks? :(
[01:14:05] <Ziber> If I put "<br>" it shows up on the page.
[01:14:18] <Zhy> certainly ... I'm doing it myself, appending long strings to specifiy html elements
[01:14:26] <Zhy> ziber I think you want <br/>
[01:14:46] <hooloovoo> Ziber: are you using .text() to add the html?
[01:15:22] <Zhy> sorry though if br is valid too :0
[01:15:37] <Ziber> ooh. .html(), right.
[01:16:04] <hooloovoo> Ziber: right. =)
[01:16:15] <Ziber> thanks!
[01:16:17] <hooloovoo> np
[01:22:55] <Zhy> has anyone here encountered problems with umlauts or special characters when using javascript/ jQuery functions? I'm using infieldlabel, autocomplete and some ajax validation via plugins but characters like √§√∂√º or [] aren't displayed correctly.
[01:23:32] <Cork> Zhy: why arn't you just using unicode?
[01:24:50] <Zhy> Hmm Cork I must admit I can't say that I'm aware of NOT using it ... how can I check ? I'm not messing with charsets in any way in my javascript
[01:24:54] <NodeX> anyone know how to get boolean true/false out of the .data() method ?
[01:25:31] <NodeX> for example I am setting them wiht <input type="text" data-foo="true"  id="foo" /> ... but it returns a string true not a bool true
[01:25:42] <Cork> Zhy: javascript is utf8
[01:25:57] <Cork> Zhy: check so your database, and the way you save your files is utf8
[01:26:02] <Zhy> Hmm that's what I set everywhere :/
[01:26:11] <Cork> and that you set encoding to urf-8
[01:26:22] <Cork> then you don't need to escape the characters
[01:26:56] <Zhy> hmm okay  thanks, so somewhere in my app there must still be a charset devil :D
[01:27:03] <Cork> anyway when dom parses the html, it will give it back to javascript as utf-8 not encoded
[01:27:28] <Cork> that might be what messes with you
[01:28:02] <Zhy> how would I prevent it despite setting any charset parameters to utf8 ?
[01:28:11] <innociv__> http://www.jplayer.org/latest/demo-04/ Is this not working in Firefox12 for others?
[01:28:19] <Cork> Zhy: prevent what?
[01:28:39] <Zhy> btw is it correct that my GET ajax request looks like this: ?data%5BUser%5D bla instead of ?data[User] ... ? It's because of it being a url, right?
[01:29:18] <Cork> Zhy: yes
[01:29:24] <Cork> that urlencode
[01:29:39] <Cork> [] isn't proxy safe
[01:30:01] <Zhy> Hmm apparently that's what is used in my php backend functions instead of data[User]
[01:30:26] <Cork> it'll be data[User] when php gets it
[01:31:00] <Cork> innociv__: wfm in ff15
[01:31:20] <Zhy> ah okay, was mistaken, sorry ^^
[01:31:24] <innociv__> ff15? The heck.
[01:31:35] <Zhy> there's another error in the url I was looking into
[01:31:39] <Cork> same with ff12
[01:31:49] <Zhy> Final Fantasy? Oo
[01:31:52] <Cork> innociv__: ff15 is nightly
[01:32:02] <Zhy> ah firefox :0 duh
[01:32:07] <Cork> 13 is beta, 14 is aurora
[01:32:11] * Zhy smashes his head against the wall to clear his thoughts
[01:32:18] <soee> i have checkbox, without checked attribute specified but condition if($(this).attr('checked')) {..} returns true any idea why ?
[01:32:21] <Takyoji> oh doy, apparently Javascript itself has a appendChild() function on all objects. xP
[01:32:31] <innociv__> I see
[01:32:36] <Cork> Takyoji: on all nodes yes
[01:32:40] <Cork> not objects :)
[01:32:50] <Takyoji> nodes, yes.
[01:32:59] <Takyoji> because I was asking about that earlier. xP
[01:33:13] <Cork> ?.prop @ soee
[01:33:15] <NodeX> soee : try prop('checked');
[01:33:24] <NodeX> ^^
[01:33:35] <Cork> soee: .attr will check what you set on the element when you sent the original html
[01:33:55] <Cork> NodeX: your stepping in inplace of bot-t?
[01:34:02] <Cork> you support ?eval too? :D
[01:34:31] <soee> Cork, ok let me try
[01:35:14] <NodeX> no - was typing it at the time!
[01:35:27] <NodeX> prop() ftw
[01:35:42] <Cork> NodeX: i know, i just found it funny that i missed that you answerd and not bot-t XD
[01:36:02] <MacroMan> I'm using scroll to move a div with the page: http://jsfiddle.net/6kXns/2/ but it seems a bit choppy. It sometimes has to catch up with itself and it looks messy.
[01:36:35] <NodeX> Cork : ;)
[01:36:36] <MacroMan> I've seen this kind of thing done really smoothly on other websites. How can I acheieve the same effect?
[01:37:23] <NodeX> MacroMan : most sites will use a fixed position for smoothness
[01:37:34] <NodeX> IE6 wont support it so fallback to CSS when not supporteds
[01:37:40] <NodeX> -s
[01:38:19] <MacroMan> In the jsfiddle I posted it's always in the same position, but in ym actual code I need it to stop scrolling when it reaches certain points on a page, so I can't use fixed positioning
[01:38:32] <Cork> ya, javascript can't really do it, cause the browser doens't send the events smoothly
[01:38:57] <NodeX> you can use fixed .. just watch for the points on the page and change the CSS position if it's on that point
[01:39:11] <NodeX> then you dont fire a new position all the time - only when you need to
[01:39:13] <MacroMan> Cork: I wonder what methods other sites have used then. I'll have to look at their code
[01:39:16] <NodeX> thus keeping it smooth
[01:39:28] <Cork> MacroMan: they do what NodeX explains
[01:39:31] <NodeX> MacroMan : they use exactly what I described
[01:39:51] <NodeX> trackitdown.net is a good example
[01:39:57] <MacroMan> NodeX: Thanks. I'll have a look, but I think I'll have dificulty using Fixed because of my page layout.
[01:40:10] <Cork> MacroMan: most likly not a problem
[01:40:28] <Cork> MacroMan: fixed is relative to the closest window object
[01:40:39] <Cork> so the form of the page rarly matters
[01:41:14] <MacroMan> Cork: Really? I thought fixed was relative to the whole page?
[01:41:40] <Cork> MacroMan: its relative to the viewport
[01:41:51] <ASDasd> :)
[01:41:52] <Cork> the window of the page, or a frame or iframe
[01:42:19] <MacroMan> Ah OK. Well I'll give it a go, but I think I tried to position fixed before without success.
[01:43:24] <NodeX> you might just have to move it up a node or 2
[01:43:59] <NodeX> I have a position fixed bar a bit like google's new black bar which is buried deep in my page but always stays at the top of the page
[01:44:22] <MacroMan> Hmm. When I do a position fixed and don't specify a left it sits to the left of the parent div, but when I specify a left it does it from the left of the window. I have ceneterd content, so I can't have that.
[01:44:28] <Cork> position: fixed is R-E-A-L-Y badly supported on mobile devices though, but thats another matter
[01:44:52] <NodeX> Macroman : left:50% ?
[01:45:02] <NodeX> or 25% .. can never remember
[01:45:04] <Cork> MacroMan: so grab the elements original offset().left
[01:45:12] <Cork> and set that
[01:45:25] <MacroMan> Cork: So is the far too complex jquery lol
[01:46:12] <Takyoji> What would be a decent event to bind to for updating something when a selection of a dropdown form field is changed (by either mouse or keyboard)?
[01:46:25] <MacroMan> When I do a percentage left, the div doesn't stay in line with the other content when the page is resized.
[01:46:52] <Takyoji> Sorry, I should have looked harder. .change() is what I was looking for
[01:47:10] <Cork> Takyoji: you need change AND keypress
[01:47:24] <Cork> change isn't triggered on key events for select elements
[01:49:36] <NodeX> MacroMan : I assumed you had set the width of your content with percentages
[01:49:48] <NodeX> set an explicit left in pixels
[01:49:48] <Takyoji> So then what's the point of .change() if it's only like a .mouseup() (or whichever it is) event? xP
[01:50:10] <NodeX> change can be triggered by a keyboard
[01:50:12] <Cork> Takyoji: its not only mouseup
[01:50:47] <Cork> NodeX: not on select elements
[01:50:53] <NodeX> really ?
[01:50:58] <Cork> ya
[01:51:09] <MacroMan> NodeX: My page is centered by setting a width of 960px and a margin or auto. When I set the left in pixels, it sets it from the left of the whole window, not the left of the parent div
[01:51:12] <NodeX> learn something new every day
[01:51:13] <Cork> i've written that hack enough times to know :)
[01:51:30] <MacroMan> margin OF auto. sorry
[01:52:26] <Cork> NodeX: $select.change(function() { $rel.html(new_value); }).keypress(function() { var $self = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $self.change(); }, 0); });
[01:52:28] <NodeX> <div style="position:fixed;width:960px;margin-left:auto">....
[01:53:22] <NodeX> quick caching question that always bugged me ... are $foo (objects preceeded with "$") always cached
[01:53:38] <Cork> no
[01:53:45] <Dr-Bombay> they're no different from any javascript variable
[01:53:54] <Cork> in those situations $ is just a character in the variable name just like anything else
[01:53:55] <NodeX> I didnt think so
[01:53:59] <MacroMan> NodeX: That div doesn't make sense.
[01:54:11] <NodeX> MacroMan : why ?
[01:54:26] <MacroMan> How can you have a position fixed and a margin left: auto?
[01:54:38] <NodeX> quite easily lol
[01:54:39] <MacroMan> They conflict on what they are trying to achieve
[01:54:49] <Cork> MacroMan: elements can have margins even when they've positioned
[01:54:51] <NodeX> you want it in a place but in the center yes?
[01:55:18] <MacroMan> I suppose so. Actually maybe this will work
[01:55:29] <MacroMan> Hang on while I try
[01:55:37] <NodeX> this will center but keep it to whereever you set top: to
[01:55:46] <Takyoji> Isn't it supposed to be .keyup() instead of .keypress()?
[01:56:28] <NodeX> keypress will keep being triggered if you hold down the keyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy iirc
[01:56:38] <MacroMan> The margin-left: auto doesn't seem to have any effect while the position is fixed.
[01:56:48] <Takyoji> For some reason I was getting odd behavior with keypress
[01:56:55] <NodeX> http://quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html
[01:57:05] <NodeX> MacroMan : must be your dom tree - works fine for me
[01:57:06] <MacroMan> Well, it sets the margin to 0px;
[01:57:16] <Takyoji> Because the function is dependent on the value of the select
[01:57:23] <NodeX> did you set an explicit width?
[01:57:47] <MacroMan> NodeX: Yes
[01:58:03] <MacroMan> position: fixed;
[01:58:03] <MacroMan> left: 61%;
[01:58:03] <MacroMan> top: 130px;
[01:58:03] <MacroMan> width: 260px;
[01:58:19] <NodeX> left is overriding it
[01:58:19] <MacroMan> Oops, skip the left, that is diabled
[01:58:34] <MacroMan> I'm using the tick boxes in chrome inspector
[01:59:26] <NodeX> You're probably going to have to create a demo.. it's hard to guess your structure
[01:59:57] <MacroMan> My structure is v. large, so will probably take a while to disect
[02:00:25] <NodeX> copy page source lol
[02:00:30] <NodeX> add to fiddle!
[02:00:53] <MacroMan> I can't really share the whole page on an open channel, but I'll see what I can do. Give me a few mins
[02:06:06] <soee> if i have 2,3 classess assigned to element, can i somehow get one of them with maybe regular expression if i know only first part of class name ?
[02:06:52] <soee> so basicly do something on all elements that have class "item-XXX" where XXX can be some number
[02:11:23] <NodeX> you can do things like [class^=blah.....]
[02:11:47] <NodeX> not very efficient so I would recommend giving it some context or selecting after the parent
[02:12:13] <quicksilver> or replace class="item-XXX" with class="item XXX"
[02:12:16] <quicksilver> use multiple classes.
[02:12:22] <quicksilver> then .item will work.
[02:16:01] <MacroMan> NodeX: Pm'd you. Are you able to take a quick look?
[02:22:33] <Kingsy> guys, anyone know of a jquery image slider that has a loader? so you can use larger images and the user has a nice little loading bar? or something?
[02:22:50] <soee> how can i count all elements that have the same rel attribute ?
[02:25:58] <Cork> soee: $('[rel="' + myrel + '"]').length
[02:26:17] <soee> Cork, yes thank you, just figure it out
[02:34:20] <demetan> @pgiraud : [0][1] are the array's features,, and it's suppose to empty the vector layer
[02:37:08] <sacredchao> `search important
[02:37:13] <sacredchao> oops sorry
[02:52:07] <steveccc> is it possible to reduce the width of an item with animate but stop the text from being wrapped ie just truncate it
[02:53:45] <gazzwi86> hey all
[02:55:12] <sacredchao> hi
[02:55:50] <gazzwi86> I'm usingim using jquery cycle to navigate a page, and i was wondering how I could detect what element is in the viewport to update the active navigation buttons?
[02:56:10] <sacho> is there an in-depth explanation on jquery effects?
[02:56:18] <sacho> I'm a bit confused about how the queues are executed
[03:03:35] <Ar-ras> Does somebody know if it is possible to combine sortable with selectable?
[03:12:28] <Xotix> is there some function which checks if a string just contains numbers?
[03:12:48] <quicksilver> Xotix: all isDigit
[03:13:04] <quicksilver> Xotix: oh, wrong language.
[03:13:12] <quicksilver> use regexp
[03:14:21] <Xotix> quicksilver: ok
[03:14:24] <sacho> Xotix, contains numbers in what way
[03:14:30] <rarevishal> hi all,
[03:14:31] <sacho> are they separated by something
[03:14:36] <sacho> or do you mean, "is a number"
[03:15:04] <rarevishal> is ther anyway through which i can change the size of text box being shown for datepicker, as it covering the entire width of page
[03:16:05] <Xotix> sacho i think this is ok: '222s'.match(/[0-9]*/); just need to know on each key hit on an input field if the user added a non int char
[03:16:27] <sviatovigt> if I have something like: $(document).ready(function() { function(){ ... }}), when will be executed the inner function?
[03:16:34] <sacho> Xotix, just use parseInt()
[03:17:14] <Xotix> sacho sounds wrong but i'll take a look
[03:17:17] <sacho> what makes you think it will?
[03:17:47] <sacho> the inner function won't be executed if that's your whole code
[03:19:01] <Xotix> sacho because of the parsing in the name.If a string contains anythign else then 0-9 return false if it just contains 0-9 return true.
[03:20:59] <rarevishal> is ther anyway through which i can change the size of text box being shown for datepicker, as it covering the entire width of page
[03:25:15] <Kitu> hello
[03:25:53] <Kitu> I don't understand why this code work only once :
[03:26:01] <Kitu> http://pastie.org/3965484
[03:26:50] <sviatovigt> rarevishal: there are a lot of ways to change the size of a text box, regardless if it is show for a datepicker or not
[03:26:54] <Kitu> it add once and it not add more ..
[03:27:10] <sviatovigt> you could use addClass() for example
[03:27:22] <Xotix> Kitu use on
[03:27:28] <sviatovigt> create a css class in which you define the width
[03:27:43] <sviatovigt> and then apply it to the text box
[03:28:03] <rarevishal> sciatovigt, i am using cakephp and this box is automatically generated
[03:28:22] <Kitu> Xotix .on() ?
[03:29:21] <Famic> it seems .position() gives me the position relatively to the window and not relatively to its parent. Any idea why ?
[03:29:41] <sviatovigt> I thought you might use cakephp, since it's default css sets the width of input elements inside of a form to 98%
[03:29:54] <sviatovigt> while the form has 100% I think :)
[03:30:09] <sviatovigt> but you have asked how to do it with jquery
[03:30:35] <Xotix> Kitu yes. make a live dmeo at jsfiddle click just add the logic to the element you selected and not to  further elements you add. For that you need on. But i might be wrong and just missunderstood your script.
[03:30:58] <sviatovigt> all you need to know is this: an element is rendered according to it's properties set in css
[03:31:03] <Lexflex3000> hello folks
[03:31:21] <sviatovigt> so to change the way it looks you have to change the css
[03:31:40] <Xotix> Kitu it should add more when clicking on the first add. The ones which gets added won't add new ones. Won't have an event handler assigned.
[03:31:41] <sviatovigt> the way you apply css to those elements, it's only your choise
[03:32:03] <Lexflex3000> i have a question: i seen that fancybox (a jquery plugin) is released under "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0" license. does that mean i am not allowed to use it in my clients website?
[03:33:03] <sviatovigt> Lexflex3000: read the license :)
[03:33:23] <Lexflex3000> yeah well, it says: Noncommercial ó You may not use this work for commercial purposes.
[03:33:33] <sviatovigt> can someone please help with this:
[03:33:37] <sviatovigt> if I have something like: $(document).ready(function() { function(){ ... }}), when will be executed the inner function?
[03:33:56] <Xotix> sviatovigt: when te dom is loaded
[03:34:01] <Lexflex3000> what the hell? can i only use it for my private blog where i have no income at all? how can anyone even use it like this?
[03:34:19] <sviatovigt> so it is executed by default when the dom is loaded?
[03:34:22] <sviatovigt> automatically?
[03:34:28] <Xotix> Lexflex3000: therei s lightbox2 which you can buy iirc. and other lightbox alternatives
[03:34:42] <Xotix> sviatovigt: should, try it.
[03:35:37] <Lexflex3000> what about jQuery itself? It is licensed under MIT and GPL licenses. Can I use it for commercial projects? (how could the answer to this be no?)
[03:35:37] <tga> quick check about deferred chaining
[03:36:07] <tga> action1.then(..process output..).pipe(action2).then(..process output 2..).pipe(action3) etc
[03:36:20] <tga> this is the proper way to chain stuff, right?
[03:36:29] <Xotix> sviatovigt: seems like it won't execute the 2nd one
[03:37:21] <Xotix> sviatovigt: http://jsfiddle.net/PjqGH/ this would work. . . but you better ask the cracks :)
[03:38:30] <Whirl3d> I am using lazy loading (not the plugin, the concept) to load images from a directory based on JSON data I retrieve from a mySQL db and wondered how others do this: Do you preload one image for immediate access when "next" is called and then hold one image (offstage) in case prev was called? or do you just have two images and load in the one that is'nt "current"
[03:38:33] <NodeX> sviatovigt : if you want it to be executed on document ready wrap it in a self executing function
[03:43:07] <Kitu> Xotix it's the same problem with on
[03:43:31] <Xotix> Kitu jsfiddle.net
[03:43:51] <rarevishal> why this code does not work ?    $("#datepicker").datepicker( {    onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { alert(dateText); } }	 	);
[03:44:08] <sacredchao> isn't it just 'select' ?
[03:44:09] <rarevishal> it shows datePicker , but not the alert on selection
[03:44:28] <sacredchao> $("#datepicker").datepicker( {    select: function(dateText, inst) { alert(dateText); } }	 	);
[03:44:31] <sacredchao> like this?
[03:44:34] <Kitu> ok, 3 seconds
[03:44:52] <sacredchao> rarevishal, does that work..?
[03:45:11] <Kitu> Xotix http://jsfiddle.net/q6U5b/
[03:45:11] <rarevishal> sacredchao, well i just copied that code from jquery.com
[03:45:22] <sacredchao> huh
[03:45:23] <rarevishal> sacredchao, i will try this too
[03:46:00] <Kitu> Xotix http://jsfiddle.net/q6U5b/1/ (with CSS :)
[03:46:20] <rarevishal> sacredchao, none of the 2 have worked
[03:46:46] <sacredchao> rarevishal, according to the docs, your version is correct
[03:47:04] <rarevishal> sacredchao, which ver it shd be
[03:47:16] <sacredchao> so please post the relevant markup and js in a fiddle
[03:47:53] <rarevishal> sacredchao, its 1.4.2
[03:48:16] <sacredchao> get the newest version of both jquery and jquery-ui ^^"
[03:48:32] <MacroMan> NodeX: I got the basket scroll working lovely now. If you want to see it, here is my finished code: http://pastebin.com/vQGyiFQh
[03:51:47] <NodeX> MacroMan : that's great ... I would cache the $() if I were you
[03:51:53] <NodeX> $("#basket");
[03:51:58] <Famic> is there a simple way to get the last floatedd element on the same "line" as a specific one ?
[03:52:28] <NodeX> var basket = $("#basket"); and use basket.css(.... etc instead - better performance
[03:52:32] <Whirl3d> .map and .last
[03:53:08] <Whirl3d> or .filter and .last
[03:53:35] <Xotix> Kitu http://jsfiddle.net/q6U5b/2/
[03:53:50] <Xotix> Kitu I'm stilwleird why your solution didn't work.
[03:53:52] <Famic> Whirl3d: who are you answering to ?
[03:54:05] <Kitu> ok
[03:54:25] <Whirl3d> $(elements).filter(function () {if $(this).position().top==$(target).position().top) return $(this)}).last();
[03:54:39] <Whirl3d> Famic, try something like that maybe?
[03:54:47] <Famic> Whirl3d: looks good
[03:55:02] <Kitu> thanks Xotix :)
[03:55:08] <Keir__> if i'm using the data- attribute on some options in a select, how can append this value of the data attribute to a hidden input when it is selected
[03:55:25] <Keir__> i've tried $('#select').change but it didnt work
[03:55:25] <Xotix> Kitu Anyway i like clone() more then what you did. With clone(true) you even can use click again. BUt on really should whave worked fine. You might ask some of the uber cracks here :P
[03:55:39] <Xotix> Kitu http://jsfiddle.net/q6U5b/3/
[03:56:38] <Kitu> ok
[03:57:06] <Famic> Whirl3d: working great. thanks
[03:57:28] <Whirl3d> 'glad to hear it. 8)
[03:59:04] <Keir__> ah its ok i've found the solution

[04:07:20] <dezzz> Hi
[04:13:45] <MacroMan> NodeX: Thanks for the advice on caching it. I'll do that. I need to run throught the whole script and cache lots of stuff and it can be quite slow in places. Currently at 1090 lines of code!
[04:14:43] <NodeX> ouch
[04:15:32] <MacroMan> NodeX: The company wants the whole process dynamic. Try doing that while keeping it secure! I'll defo be minifying it though.
[04:15:59] <Keir__> if i have a html element stored in an object how can i retrieve the value of it?
[04:16:31] <MacroMan> Keir__: var myvar = object.property
[04:17:12] <MacroMan> How do I put the code in the channel so the channel processes it and give the result back?
[04:17:29] <MacroMan> Or is that in the #javascript channel?
[04:17:40] <Keir__> thanks :)
[04:18:04] <MacroMan> Keir__: yw
[04:18:42] <sacredchao> MacroMan, you can use >> in #javascript, but its really not for debugging, only for demonstrating
[04:19:30] <MacroMan> sacredchao: Yes, that's what I want it for, but not here then :(
[04:19:58] <sacredchao> go to ##javascript, post your line, c&p your result here :)
[04:20:32] <MacroMan> lol. Could do
[04:20:49] <sacredchao> v8> 'test';
[04:20:55] <sacredchao> js> 'test';
[04:20:56] <sacredchao> meh
[04:20:58] <sacredchao> ight
[04:21:00] <sacredchao> right
[04:21:07] <sacredchao> those are only in ##javascript
[04:21:14] <sacredchao> and '>>'
[04:27:08] <Keir__> how do i add an item at the start of the array?
[04:27:29] <Keir__> unshift?
[04:36:58] <Ar-ras>  Does somebody know if it is possible to combine Jquery UI sortable with Jquery UI selectable?
[04:41:10] <Whirl3d> did you look?

[05:10:29] <brajan> Hi, I'm trying to make a checkbox checked when u click on it. When you refresh the page after you have clicked in the checkbox, the checkbox should be checked, be it is not.
[05:10:30] <brajan> Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/hzDw5dYs
[05:10:58] <sacredchao> brajan, unfortunately, unless you are using asp.net webforms, the web is stateless :)
[05:11:01] <pachet> sacredchao: it's ?ask, but bot-t is not-t
[05:11:08] <sacredchao> pachet, ah!
[05:11:44] <brajan> So I can't accomplish this? Must I use PHP to modify it?
[05:11:55] <aikon> I need to implement a function like this:
[05:12:35] <sacredchao> brajan, yes you have to do that on the server side ... if you request something using a normal request (not xhr), the current state of the page gets 'cleared'
[05:12:44] <sacredchao> please correct me if i am wrong
[05:12:54] <pachet> brajan: i mean, certain browsers will try and preserve page state to greater and lesser degrees
[05:13:05] <pachet> definitely not something i would rely on across the board
[05:13:07] <pachet> *form state
[05:13:39] <sacredchao> you can use stuff like localstorage to have a persistant storage on the client side
[05:13:49] <aikon> i need to implement an easy function like this
[05:13:50] <aikon> $("td").hover(   function () {     $(this).addClass("hover");   },   function () {     $(this).removeClass("hover");   } );
[05:13:51] <brajan> pachet: hm, okey, I'm  not sure what that means. But how can I fix this ? Any tip?
[05:14:52] <pachet> brajan: sacredchao told you -- if you want to preserve page state between several requests, it's a job for your backend or localstorage
[05:15:04] <sacredchao> also xhr
[05:15:28] <pachet> aikon: looks straightforward, what's the issue?
[05:22:26] <jeffkiesel> hi all, quick selector question

[05:32:55] <cordoval> hi guys will this set the value var uuidField = $(prototype).find('#shop_bankHolidays__name__uuid').val(UUID().toString()); ?
[05:33:06] <cordoval> why is not setting the value of the field
[05:34:44] <DeltaHeavy> I want to test if a text box has some character(s), a space, and more character(s). Is there anything wrong with this regex?  /^+[ ]+$/
[05:36:00] <sacredchao> what about this /[a-zA-Z0-9]+\s.*/ ?
[05:37:20] <sacredchao> hmm /\S+\s.*/ should work too
[05:37:39] <sacredchao> or maybe hack with split(" ")
[05:39:07] <Jon47> DeltaHeavy: what's that plus sign doing at the start and end?  my regex isn't that strong but isn't that an argument that says there should be one or more of the preceding characters?  doesn't make sense at the start of the string does it?
[05:39:08] <pachet> var value='foo bar'; if ( value.split(' ').length > 1 ) { //ding }
[05:39:28] <sacredchao> pachet, i find regexp more elegant though :)
[05:39:38] <pachet> heh yeah, but since you mentioned it :D
[05:39:52] <sacredchao> Jon47, DeltaHeavy, indeed your regexp does not make sense at all :)
[05:39:55] <sacredchao> pachet :)
[05:40:45] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: Thanks, it works
[05:40:48] <sacredchao> i'd go with /\S+\s.*/
[05:40:52] <sacredchao> cool, np
[05:40:53] <DeltaHeavy> Jon47: I though + was the same as .+
[05:40:59] <Jon47> ah, i see
[05:41:09] <DeltaHeavy> Would /^.+\s.+$/ work?
[05:41:20] <sacredchao> i think . is greedy
[05:41:30] <sacredchao> so it would match whitespaces, too
[05:41:43] <sacredchao> you'd need positive lookahead
[05:42:20] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: That would be needed anyway
[05:42:29] <DeltaHeavy> It just needs at least one space
[05:42:37] <DeltaHeavy> And not at the ends
[05:42:49] <sacredchao> well \S says 'any char but whitespace'
[05:42:54] <sacredchao> so its a fake lookahead :)
[05:43:04] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: THanks
[05:43:39] <sacredchao> DeltaHeavy, for further lecture, http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/redev2.shtml
[05:43:54] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks for the resource!
[05:43:58] <sacredchao> np :)
[05:49:50] <sacredchao> DeltaHeavy, hmm i thought a bit: so you want a regexp that matches a string which has _at least_ one whitespace somewhere, but not in the beginning and not in the end?
[05:50:21] <sviatovigt> what event is when a you enter text in an input type="text"?
[05:50:24] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: Yeah, wouldn't /^.+\s.+$/ do the trick?
[05:50:44] <sacredchao> DeltaHeavy, well no :)
[05:51:07] <sacredchao> as i said, . is greedy, so it matches \s too and does not 'abort'
[05:51:29] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: I want there to be the option of mulitple white spaces.
[05:51:51] <sacredchao> maybe /(\S+\s)+\S$/
[05:52:05] <sacredchao> that would match "a b c d"
[05:52:19] <sacredchao> but not "abcd", or " abcd", or "abcd "
[05:52:25] <sacredchao> (if i made no mistake)
[05:52:44] <pachet> sviatovigt: change, customarily, but it wont fire until the actual value changes in the input
[05:52:49] <pachet> meaning it loses focus, or what have you
[05:53:02] <pachet> so maybe in your case you want to track the key events themselves
[05:53:50] <g0ng> can someone help me with $.ajax in a json request? I keep getting "invalid label" for the JSON result
[05:54:01] <pachet> g0ng: means your result isn't valid json :[
[05:54:30] <pachet> can you paste what the server is sending back?
[05:54:37] <g0ng> pachet: but it is. I checked it. I use http://192.168.0.16:8041/Mobiles/LogOn.json?callback=?' and dataType: json
[05:55:08] <sviatovigt> does anyone knows what event is when I insert text in an input type="text"?
[05:55:10] <g0ng> {"ERROR":null,"PARTNER1":null,"PARTNER2":null,"PARTNER2Reference":null,"TEMP_CONTRACT":null,"CODE":"000000001","USER_NAME":"000000001","NAME":"ŒùŒôŒöŒüŒ£ Œ†ŒëŒ†ŒëŒîŒüŒ†ŒüŒ•ŒõŒüŒ£","MOBILE_NUMBER":"","FAX_NUMBER":"2310804860","EMAIL_ADDRESS":"mdim@gr","IS_ACTIVE":true,"CAN_ISSUE_TEMP_CONTRACT":true,"PARENT_PARTNER_CODE":null,"IS_ADMIN":false,"EntityState":1,"EntityKey":null}
[05:55:24] <pachet> sviatovigt: i answered you already
[05:55:43] <g0ng> firebug also recognise it as json
[05:56:27] <g0ng> pachet: and here is the call http://pastebin.com/jv8TtWnJ
[05:56:43] <sviatovigt> ohhh sorry
[05:56:44] <g0ng> success: is never reached
[05:56:53] <sviatovigt> I saw now
[05:57:50] <chilversc_> g0ng: is the server sending a valid Content-Type header?
[05:58:05] <chilversc_> g0ng: eg,; Content-Type: text/json;charset=utf-8
[05:58:10] <g0ng> Content-Typeapplication/json; charset=utf-8
[05:58:23] <g0ng> IIS6.0
[05:58:48] <chilversc_> g0ng: then jQuery will automatically parse the data for you, so data will be a javascript object
[05:58:55] <sacredchao> DeltaHeavy, i checked /(\S+\s)+\S$/ and it seems to work
[05:59:13] <sacredchao> what i tested:
[05:59:16] <sacredchao> var myarray = ["a b c", "abc", " abc", "abc ", " a b c "]; myarray.map(function(elem) { return elem.match(/(\S+\s)+\S$/);});
[05:59:23] <g0ng> chilversc_: the problem is that $.ajax never reaches success function
[05:59:27] <chilversc_> g0ng: hmm, though not sure about application/json, I've found that isn't always accepted, hence why I still use text/json
[05:59:33] <sacredchao> the result;  [['a b c', 'b '], null, null, null, null]
[05:59:51] <chilversc_> g0ng: oh, is the server returning a success code, or an error code?
[05:59:51] <rroelofs> g0ng: my guess is that the json has an invalid utf-8 char
[05:59:57] <DeltaHeavy> sacredchao: Thanks, I'll test it out
[06:00:00] <g0ng>  chilversc_:  200 code
[06:00:22] <chilversc_> g0ng: odd, 200 should always go to the success handler, unless there was a parse error with the content
[06:00:34] <pachet> he already said there was a parse error :[
[06:00:38] <g0ng> rroelofs: but I tested it with a json checker
[06:01:03] <pachet> try swapping out those greek characters and see if it still doesnt hit the callback
[06:01:06] <chilversc_> g0ng: which now I think about it, that could come from jquery not recognising the content-type, do you have the ability to change the server to return text/json; charset=utf-8; instead of application/json?
[06:01:08] <pachet> even though they validated for me in lint :[
[06:01:22] <sacredchao> ^^" oh wait its (/(\S+\s)+\S+$/
[06:01:27] <sacredchao> gaah
[06:01:51] <rroelofs> g0ng: can you point your browser at the url that is returning the json to make sure you are getting what you think you are?
[06:01:54] <g0ng> chilversc_: I will try. the thing is that this code is already parsed by apps in android and iPhone. I was making a port to phonegap and used jquery mobiled
[06:01:57] <g0ng> mobile
[06:02:19] <g0ng> rroelofs: yes, I do get a valid response. I will try altering content-type
[06:02:50] <chilversc_> g0ng: I remember having trouble with application/json in the past not always being handled correctly
[06:02:56] <sviatovigt> pachet: that will only be triggered when I will lose the focus from that element
[06:03:24] <sviatovigt> what I want, is the event that occurs after each letter is entered
[06:03:49] <Xotix> sviatovigt:  keydown?
[06:03:55] <sviatovigt> I could use .keypress() but in the documentation it has a note
[06:03:59] <pachet> sviatovigt: i also accounted for that in my original answer :[
[06:04:00] <sviatovigt> that scares me
[06:04:07] <pachet> keypress, keyup, what have you
[06:04:33] <sviatovigt> that it might not work in all browsers
[06:04:58] <Xotix> sviatovigt: atm i doing some loginc on each key enteed into a input field and i use keydown together with timeOut 50ms.
[06:05:38] <sviatovigt> pachet: unfortunately I have changed the irc client and this one is killing me
[06:05:52] <sviatovigt> I can bearly read from it
[06:09:11] <toddWork> in jqueryui dialog, it is doing: var uiDialogClasses ='ui-dialog ' +'ui-widget ' +'ui-widget-content ' +'ui-corner-all ',
[06:09:14] <toddWork> what is that?
[06:09:36] <sviatovigt> it creates a variable
[06:10:10] <toddWork> it's just a string of class names like so: ui-dialogui-widgetui-widget-contentui-corner-all
[06:10:12] <sviatovigt> called uiDialogClass that equals to 'ui-dialog ui-widget ...'
[06:10:13] <toddWork> how is it used?
[06:10:36] <toddWork> oh
[06:10:40] <toddWork> there is a space there.
[06:10:58] <toddWork> i bet it adds udDialogClasses to the dom elements?
[06:11:21] <toddWork> so, <div class="ui-dialog ui-widget . . .
[06:11:23] <toddWork> ah. thanks.
[06:11:39] <sviatovigt> if I use something like: $("#target").keypress(function(){})
[06:12:14] <sviatovigt> what whould I specify as a parameter for the function so that I could use this.addClass for example
[06:12:24] <sviatovigt> but not the element itself
[06:13:05] <pachet> huh?
[06:13:39] <toddWork> sviatovigt: $(this).addClass is your target
[06:14:17] <toddWork> you would do $('anything else').addClass() in the function.
[06:15:28] <g0ng> I changed the content type but have the same problem
[06:15:30] <sviatovigt> pachet: never mind
[06:15:34] <sviatovigt> stupid question
[06:16:37] <g0ng>  chilversc_: I also changed the code to return only this: {"p1":1,"p2":3,"p3":"lala"} but have the same error
[06:18:01] <chilversc_> g0ng: odd, will the problem re-create in a jsfiddle?
[06:18:38] <g0ng>  chilversc_: I am not sure what you mean
[06:19:08] <chilversc_> g0ng: http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:19:47] <g0ng> is it to test things?
[06:19:56] <g0ng> my server runs on localhost
[06:20:02] <chilversc_> g0ng: it has an echo service to simulate ajax http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[06:26:15] <g0ng>  chilversc_:  on teh other hand chrome's error is: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[06:29:05] <chilversc_> g0ng: have you tried using json2 with ie6? load it before jquery, and it will provide the standard window.JSON object
[06:29:25] <g0ng> I am using FF normaly
[06:29:45] <chilversc_> g0ng: also, does the JSON have a BOM header at the start, could that be interfering with it?
[06:30:38] <g0ng> chilversc_: I was thinking of that. But how can I check? I use jsonResult in asp MVC
[06:31:01] <chilversc_> g0ng: I like to use fiddler2, otherwise there's wireshark
[06:31:13] <chilversc_> http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/
[06:33:55] <nothlveheart> hey guys
[06:34:10] <nothlveheart> anyone wanna take a shot a simplifying this jquery into a more maintainable code?
[06:34:11] <nothlveheart> lol
[06:40:07] <nothlveheart> http://pastebin.com/BpemqAB6 ... Code works, but can anyone help me at taking a shot at simplifying it?
[06:42:38] <hooloovoo> nothlveheart: have a look at .data(), maybe that can help you out.
[06:43:11] <rroelofs> nothlveheart: i'd put the classnames in an array and loop over it for each ond add the classif necessary and then add the click handler
[06:43:59] <rroelofs> if the class has no css style function you don't need them
[06:49:36] <toddWork> in the last code example here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[06:49:45] <toddWork> where are the options initialized?
[06:50:46] <toddWork> or, where do i define the initial set of options?
[06:51:05] <nothlveheart> hooloovoo, the addclasses were lazy mans code that I had in there for a concept, I just hardcoded them on the images
[06:51:07] <nothlveheart> lol
[06:51:48] <hooloovoo> toddWork: you make a object with your options in the init function
[06:52:07] <nothlveheart> But as far as the repeated jquery all throughout the rest of the code, should I just keep it as is
[06:52:38] <toddWork> hooloovoo: ok. but inside of the if(!date) or just above it and combine them w/ the var definition that is already there?
[06:52:45] <toddWork> *dta
[06:52:47] <toddWork> *data
[06:53:14] <hooloovoo> toddWork: sec
[06:53:29] <toddWork> so like after tooltip = $(. . ., settings = $.extend. . .?
[06:53:36] <hooloovoo> toddWork: have a look at this instead http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[06:53:43] <toddWork> hooloovoo: ok, thanks.
[06:53:48] <hooloovoo> it's much nicer
[07:09:26] <locojay> hi i would like to add export button's to jquery datatables like http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/button_options . adding this piece does not show the buttons.. do i need to include anything else?
[07:12:58] <locojay> got it seems like i need to download tabletools
[07:16:02] <alecharp1> hi, I'm trying to use the validation process of jquery. in a form I have a <select> with the correct "required" class. When a add option in it it doesn't validate if I don't select one of the options
[07:16:44] <alecharp1> does someone already has this error?
[07:23:57] <phragg> Anyone ever use the TokenInput (http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/) I'm trying to send the items added via post.
[07:33:21] <antihero> Hey, how do I easily manipulate the values of a multi <select> lement?
[07:39:49] <richprice316> anyone know how to just echo the special price in list.phtml
[07:43:02] <toddWork> hooloovoo: (or whomever) for jQuery boilerplate, would i put my methods in Plugin or Plugin.prototype.init?
[07:43:31] <toddWork> or is prototype.init for setting up events after Plugin has been called?
[07:44:31] <varnie> Hi there.
[07:46:33] <varnie> my simple question is described there: http://pastebin.com/9JskinMn
[07:46:50] <varnie> which one would you choose and why?
[07:52:01] <varnie> I guess the second approach is wrong.
[07:54:41] <christo_m> Hello, im trying to use the combobox defined here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox , how can i grab the value on change

[08:14:55] <nanovirus> hey folks, got a problem with fancybox, if I open it up with the window at half size, then it has scrollbars in the modal... If I then resize the window, the scrollbar remains and the size of the fancybox doesn't adapt to the new window size.  Any way round this?
[08:20:53] <mnewton> Hey guys, can one of you who uses firefox help me debug this problem. If you go to this website http://trollo.host56.com/ You will find that you can't click on the input place. If you used chrome however this is not a problem. What's going wrong? The field doesn't get focus on click.
[08:21:51] <phragg> Has anyone used TokenInput: http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/ I'm trying to $_POST the input box used to a DB but shows up blank.

[08:41:23] <alex-going-nutso> hello everyone
[08:42:04] <alex-going-nutso> anyone know how to get jquery nested accordion to open to a specific tab when page loads?   i am very very new to this
[08:42:32] <alex-going-nutso> i have been trying to change the "initShow" function
[08:43:48] <shoky> alex-going-nutso: jquery ui ? you need the 'active' option..
[08:44:13] <shoky> oh nested accordion.
[08:44:43] <alex-going-nutso> shoky:  i don't really understand the syntax stuff.... should i post the function i have at the beginning of my html for reference?
[08:45:24] <locojay1> hi i have the following sdom in jquery datatables"sDom": "<'row'<'span8'l><'span8'f>r>t<'row'<'span8'i><'span8'p>>" i would like to add frtiS to have scrolling but can't seem to get this to work together
[08:45:37] <alex-going-nutso> shoky: when the page loads... nothing is active yet
[08:45:40] <phragg> Has anyone used TokenInput locojay1 alex-going-nutso http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[08:45:53] <phragg> err... didn't mean to type your name..
[08:45:59] <shoky> alex-going-nutso: yeah forget the 'active', you're not using jquery ui accordion
[08:46:27] <shoky> alex-going-nutso: anyway it seems the initShow option needs a jquery selector
[08:46:31] <alex-going-nutso> shoky:  nope... nested accordion.. is this the wrong palce to ask question
[08:47:19] <alex-going-nutso> i didn't want to bog up the board with the code...
[08:47:31] <alex-going-nutso> well it's only 5 lines
[08:48:20] <alex-going-nutso> shoky:  any ideas?
[08:52:12] <crivera> if I want to add a $.ready on my page, how do I make sure jquery was loaded in time?
[08:52:41] <crivera> i mean, jquery lib is being loaded asynchronously, right?
[08:52:50] <crivera> what's ensuring that $.ready is gonna' work all the time?
[08:53:22] <hooloovoo> no it's not
[08:53:57] <hooloovoo> just do the $(function() {  }); after the script that includes jquery.
[08:54:53] <vaicine> Is it possible to find an element based off it's html content?
[08:55:08] <TheEternalAbyss> is anyone familiar with jquery.carouFredSel.js?
[08:56:02] <alex-going-nutso> anyone familiar with jestedAccordion?
[08:56:12] <alex-going-nutso> nestedAccordion?
[08:58:17] <shoky> vaicine: what do you mean
[09:01:25] <Eildydar> Is it possible to autorefresh and have IE go to the same spot on the page with jquery?
[09:01:48] <TheEternalAbyss> well here's my question, i'm using jquery.carouFredSel and it works fine as long as the image width is smaller the the actual window where the webpage is rendered. Where does it pull the width and is there a way for me to tell it to adjust the width based on the image size and not window width?
[09:02:24] <shoky> crivera: that depends how you're loading jquery
[09:03:12] <veleiro> Hi, I'm new here and I'm a jquery noob, but I wanted to know something relating to jquery ui tabs.  I am adding/naming/sorting tabs.  How can I remember these newly named/added/sorted tabs upon refresh and browser restart?
[09:03:25] <crivera> shoky: any tips on how it should be loaded?
[09:03:28] <locojay1> anyone using bootsrap with datatables?
[09:03:51] <shoky> crivera: simplest way is as a regular <script> tag inside the <head> section..
[09:04:41] <crivera> thanks, sho
[09:05:02] <TheEternalAbyss> :\
[09:05:19] <shoky> crivera: and if you load it like that then anything you run after it should have access to jquery..
[09:05:30] <monk12> anyone write type="text/javascript"/"text/css" anymore in their script/style tags?
[09:05:46] <veleiro> monk12: yes
[09:05:47] <monk12> seen people not doing it and just putting the tag, wasnt sure if it passes validaiton
[09:06:08] <TheEternalAbyss> well i guess nobody knows. thanks anyways
[09:07:05] <monk12> TheEternalAbyss, can you set the parent/window container to be width:auto; in the css and see what happens?
[09:08:42] <veleiro> TheEternalAbyss: you can probably check out where dimensions are coming from if you use firebug, chrome dev tools or a similar tool
[09:09:50] <Guest2294> could anyone please tell me why this isn't working http://pastebin.com/mR423Sew (jquery)
[09:10:00] <TheEternalAbyss> veleiro: i'm trying to find that. 2500+ lines of code to look thrrough for me is a bit hard (i'm very rusty at javascript)
[09:10:52] <TheEternalAbyss> monk12: yea i tried that but the image is bigger than the container so IE7 freaks out about the scrolling
[09:11:18] <monk12> how about FF/Chrome/IE8/9? is it just IE7?
[09:11:36] <veleiro> TheEternalAbyss: if you use the selector in those tools and click on the image and/or the carousel you should see the elements/css
[09:12:54] <veleiro> I've never used caroufredsel but i assume it shouldnt be that much of a difference from jcarousel
[09:13:04] <TheEternalAbyss> veleiro: yea i'll look into it. I have to step out of th eoffice for now
[09:13:08] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you all for the help
[09:13:59] <dapingwing> so anyone ?
[09:14:13] <veleiro> anyone know how I could go about remember jquery UI added tabs upon browser refresh?
[09:14:18] <veleiro> remembering*
[09:14:36] <dapingwing> save it in a session ?
[09:15:30] <dapingwing> could anyone please tell me why this isn't working http://pastebin.com/mR423Sew (jquery)
[09:15:41] <veleiro> dapingwing:  thanks, i
[09:15:46] <veleiro> ll look into that more
[09:20:54] <dapingwing> nobody ?
[09:26:19] <rroelofs> dapingwing: console.log() your vars to see what their values really are
[09:27:05] <dapingwing> it works when i use numbers ... i dont see anything in log when using for() or while()
[09:28:21] <rroelofs> your code snippet dowsn't show how i or rowCount are set
[09:28:22] <dapingwing> var x ='table#guild_members tbody tr td table tbody tr:nth-child('+i+') td:nth-child(2)'; if i replace the i by a 1
[09:28:32] <dapingwing> var count = 0;
[09:28:32] <dapingwing> 		var i=1;
[09:28:32] <dapingwing> 		var rowCount = $('#myTable tr').length
[09:29:02] <rroelofs> dapingwing: rowCount is probably not right since you have nested tables
[09:29:08] <dapingwing> oh found it ! ;)
[09:29:12] <dapingwing> tnx anyways
[09:29:18] <dapingwing> just a typo in selectors ;o
[09:29:55] <rroelofs> good for you!  that's why console.log is so helpful.  The gap between what I think my code is doing and reality is sometimes surprising :-)
[09:30:48] <monk12> valeiro, use jquery bbq
[09:30:52] <dapingwing> yeah , i think its stupid i had to do it this way , converting a table and sending it to a DB should be much easier ;O
[09:31:44] <monk12> veleiro, http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/
[09:32:00] <monk12> so you can save tabs on browser refresh is what you want right? ^ so thats an example
[09:34:47] <sviatovigt> I want to submit a form via AJAX to a php script
[09:35:06] <sviatovigt> the data sent to the php script I want to be in an array format
[09:35:10] <sviatovigt> can I do that?
[09:37:11] <dapingwing> yeah just send the array as stringify json
[09:37:17] <dapingwing> and the convert it back to an array
[09:39:01] <sviatovigt> dapingwing: how do I stringify that array?
[09:39:18] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: seralize it
[09:39:35] <dapingwing> var myJsonString = JSON.stringify(yourArray);
[09:39:37] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: sorry read wrong just send it as json
[09:40:07] <sviatovigt> and I suppose I should create that array first
[09:40:10] <sviatovigt> don't I?
[09:40:43] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: what do you mean by "the data sent to the php script I want to be in an array format"
[09:41:20] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: for a particular form element(s)?  or the form itself?  the form itself would be in $_POST or $_GET
[09:43:06] <sviatovigt> to send the data I create a string like this: dataToSend = "var1=" + value1 + "&var2=" + value2
[09:43:24] <sviatovigt> and I send it as a parameter in the ajax request
[09:43:57] <sviatovigt> all of those vars can be taken as parameters in the script from the $_POST
[09:44:43] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: why are you creating a string?
[09:44:50] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: why don't you let jquery send everything
[09:45:02] <cordoval> i have a string with some html on it can i use http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/ ?
[09:45:10] <cordoval> to replace a tag inside?
[09:45:17] <cordoval> it is a string so it is not a dom
[09:45:20] <cordoval> can this be done?
[09:45:34] <sviatovigt> the problem is that I want to receive something like data => array(anotherNode=>array('var1'=>'value1', 'var2'=>'value2', etc))
[09:45:48] <cordoval> like <div><a>hi</a><span>hey</span></div>
[09:45:53] <cordoval> like "<div><a>hi</a><span>hey</span></div>"
[09:45:58] <sviatovigt> NoiseEee: because that is the only way I know
[09:46:08] <cordoval> prototype = "<div><a>hi</a><span>hey</span></div>";
[09:46:28] <cordoval> how to replace the <span> tag part with say string "here"
[09:46:30] <sviatovigt> could you please tell me how can I put jquery to send the form through ajax?
[09:46:33] <cordoval> can i use replaceWith?
[09:46:46] <cordoval> anyone please
[09:47:05] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:48:12] <Eildydar> Is it possible to autorefresh and have IE go to the same spot on the page with jquery?
[09:49:45] <sviatovigt> NoiseEee: thanks
[09:50:02] <sviatovigt> NoiseEee: could please give me a short example?
[09:57:57] <antihero> is there a way to force jquery to do one thing after another
[09:58:04] <antihero> so set a value THEN call this function?
[10:00:47] <Miika--> Hello
[10:08:40] <shoky> antihero: you dont need to do anything special to force that. unless you are talkig about async stuff like ajax
[10:15:16] <Guest39835> Hello.
[10:16:01] <Guest39835> Is it possible to do something with just the first element of an array of elements? If I do for example $('.myclass')[0].width(); I get an error...
[10:16:13] <prefixed> I need to make sure that 'views-row' contains 'jplayer' or else I need to match the next closest element which contains 'jplayer'. how can I do this? CURRENT CODE: $(this).closest('.views-row').next().find('.jplayer');
[10:17:15] <locojay1> anyone has jquery completion in vim?
[10:17:22] <|PiP|`> is there a mode in jquery that only allows a single handler per event?
[10:18:06] <shoky> Guest39835: $('.myclass').eq(0).width()
[10:18:22] <shoky> Guest39835: also .first()
[10:18:39] <Guest39835> shoky, ok, thank you very much!
[10:18:45] <prefixed> perhaps i cna use .contains()?
[10:20:08] <shoky> there isn't .contains()
[10:21:56] <johnline3> is there a way to trigger an event when something becomes visible?
[10:22:03] <johnline3> like you have .click()
[10:22:08] <johnline3> .visible() ?
[10:23:14] <Frantic_> guys, consider this code: https://gist.github.com/d3c882360b89ce27dff5 , I have a data preload function which starts a XHR, how can I sync another call to when the XHR finishes?
[10:24:21] <shoky> Frantic_: you put the other call in the first request's callback
[10:24:46] <Frantic> shoky: the thing is that I want the other call to be made by users of my library, I cannot control it
[10:25:58] <Frantic> is there any way to synchronously wait for an XHR even tho it was started with synchronous: false?
[10:26:03] <prefixed> shoky http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[10:26:18] <prefixed> umadbro?
[10:26:19] <shoky> uhh anyway waitForAjaxToComplete goes against javascript/ajax
[10:26:32] <shoky> prefixed: that's $.contains and it won't help you
[10:26:41] <shoky> prefixed: maybe you can use .has()
[10:27:01] <shoky> Frantic: you can set async:false on the ajax request... but that's bad
[10:27:12] <prefixed> oh ok
[10:30:34] <Frantic> consider this code https://gist.github.com/0f45012729a14d87fc62 , how do I later sync with an async:false XHR?
[10:30:54] <Chopps> johnline3 like this? http://jsfiddle.net/NHPMb/
[10:30:55] <Frantic> consider this code https://gist.github.com/0f45012729a14d87fc62 , how do I later sync with an async:true XHR? (sorry, corrected)
[10:33:50] <badbandit> hello, does anyone have experience with paginating results from an .ajax call to an api?
[10:34:02] <badbandit> our api returns 20 results at a time and I need to paginate the data, proving to be a real pain
[10:34:14] <badbandit> mainly in dealing with the last page
[10:36:38] <johnline3> thanks a lot for making that Chopps
[10:36:42] <johnline3> i will try and apply it
[10:37:51] <raj> is there a whilehovering event?
[10:38:03] <raj> so I don't have to do mouseover and mouseout each time?
[10:40:47] <psyolus> Is there actually a JSLint API? What does Crockford mean when he says that it is going to be built into applications?
[10:44:51] <prefixed> who is this http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f87/bigmike53916/persephone.jpg
[10:51:14] <codebeaker> I believe it's Monica Belluci prefixed, http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000899/
[10:52:06] <danoc> Hi, I'm having an issue where every AJAX request fails when the server-side PHP code does an echo to return the result. Does anyone know what could cause that?
[10:52:48] <codebeaker> danoc: sounds like your PHP server has a fault, but I would suggest it coule be that you are not sending a contnet-type header back, or that in sending the header you are viloating some PHP rule abotu sending headers
[10:53:13] <shoky> raj: there's mousemove
[10:53:29] <raj> hey shoky
[10:53:36] <raj> just looked it up, 'hover' was deprecated
[10:53:38] <shoky> raj: there's also .hover() if that's what yo uneed
[10:53:41] <danoc> codebreaker: It's so bizarre. No matter what I echo it fails. Works locally, just not on the server.
[10:53:47] <shoky> hey
[10:54:35] <thang> danoc: what happens when you try to hit the php directly
[10:54:45] <shoky> psyolus: some IDEs have it integrated into them so it highlights stuff while you code
[10:55:07] <psyolus> shoky: The logic, though, right?
[10:55:15] <shoky> what do you mean..
[10:56:00] <psyolus> It's  not using a web API, or anything like that. It's local.
[10:56:02] <danoc> thang: Do you mean visit the request URL directly? It shows a blank page (but it's supposed to since it's looking for a POST request)
[10:56:05] <shoky> oh
[10:56:07] <shoky> yeah
[10:56:36] <Lyfesaver> So my car breaks down, and I ask a quantum mechanic to see if he can fix it.
[10:56:38] <thang> ah i see.
[10:56:43] <Lyfesaver> He says, "I dunno, let me take a look at it."
[10:56:52] <Lyfesaver> hahaah, I love that joke... thot I would share
[10:57:07] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:20:47] <danoc> codebeaker: after hours and hours of debugging, I just realized that the issue was caused by a compression setting i had turned on in CodeIgniter. It stops the echo's from working...
[11:21:46] <codebeaker> ah, np
[11:22:36] <Funkt> Hi there I have a bit of java script I am trying to create a command to activate on click it uses :first and it identify's this as a an id "#" but when I try to change it to  a class "." it does not want to know
[11:23:16] <Funkt> is : a special way of identifying a "#" is there an alternative for class?
[11:30:56] <Zeph88> I have a "currCompliment" div, I want to do somthing with all the <p> tags. I can't seem to get them to respond. Am I not setting up my selector correctly?
[11:37:23] <wolfman2000> ...wow. I've lost track on how often jQuery is developed.
[11:37:56] <tw2113> daily?
[11:38:50] <wolfman2000> Anyway, afternoon. I'm working with a website that uses what is apparently the ancient jquery 1.4.4. I'm trying to find a decent popup gallery type plugin that is available for free regardless of use. I can live without it having AJAX support: I have a backup plan for that anyway. Do you guys know of any good ones for my ancient version, or should I convince the sysadmin to upgrade our jQuery?
[11:44:31] <silverwind> wtf... You need a sysadmin to replace a file o_O
[11:44:46] <kingnebula> yes
[11:45:11] <silverwind> wolfman2000, The best plugin of that type is IMHO "fancybox 2"
[11:45:31] <wolfman2000> silverwind: it's called "chain of command"
[11:46:16] <wolfman2000> Also, as far as I can tell, the sysadmin would be required to pay to use fancyBox. I don't think I can accept this plugin.
[11:46:33] <Funkt> Hi there Im trying to use a tab design in jquery where I click a tab and it changes to a different div this is done with id's is it possible to do it with classes instead?
[11:49:00] <codebeaker> anyone testing with jasmine know how to skip a spec? or under what conditions Jasmine will skip a spec ?
[11:49:06] <ravenzz> Funkt why would you do that?
[11:50:31] <Funkt> becuase I am also using local scroll
[11:50:49] <Funkt> see when ever it hides or brings back the div
[11:50:51] <Funkt> it moves
[11:50:59] <Funkt> becuase it has an id
[11:51:11] <Funkt> and is looking for the location of the id
[11:51:16] <Funkt> if I had a class
[11:51:22] <Funkt> it would stop
[11:51:26] <Funkt> and not hover about
[11:52:10] <Funkt> if that sort of makes sense?
[11:52:12] <ravenzz> uhuh I don't know what are you talking about, but it is not possible i guess
[11:52:26] <ravenzz> can you provide a live demo?
[11:52:33] <Funkt> wow ermmmm
[11:52:38] <Funkt> its all local ysee
[11:52:54] <ravenzz> can you reproduce it on jsfiddle.net ?
[11:53:06] <Funkt> errr not sure
[11:53:30] <Funkt> you dont think its possible to use a class instead of an id?
[11:53:37] <Funkt> I will show you the code for the tabs
[11:53:52] <catcher> I've got a user-activated element that's hidden by default, shows (position absolute) when clicked. Some of my pages are too short to account for the height of this element.  What's the best way to handle this if global min-height is not an option?  I'd rather avoid calculating max potential height on every page load too if possible.
[11:53:55] <ravenzz> it isn't, you should write further code to make it working
[11:54:19] <ravenzz> so, write your tabs script
[11:54:23] <Funkt> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/jquery-tabs/
[11:54:30] <ravenzz> also it doesn't make sense
[11:55:02] <ravenzz> I mean, if you click on a lable you cannot open 4 tabs (with the same classname) at the same moment
[11:55:05] <Funkt> it's my created version of that
[11:55:31] <Funkt> no true but could I open them with four diff calss names?
[11:55:40] <Funkt> class*
[11:56:04] <Funkt> I have tried to do it with class but it will not work
[11:56:08] <ravenzz> but why would you do that? the IDs are fine
[11:56:15] <Funkt> the id's are fine
[11:56:23] <Funkt> but at the same time i use local scroll
[11:56:30] <Funkt> local scroll also use id's
[11:56:36] <ravenzz> what is a local scroll?
[11:56:38] <silverwind> Funkt, the reason why an id is always used for tabs is because you can link to them with an anchor... so even if JS is disabled, it should still work
[11:56:48] <Funkt> ahh yes!
[11:56:54] <Funkt> good point
[11:56:59] <Funkt> so can i use class?
[11:57:03] <ravenzz> ahah
[11:57:04] <ravenzz> ok
[11:57:09] <Funkt> local scroll scrolls to an id too
[11:57:25] <Funkt> soo when it clicks the id on the hidden div it moves becuase of localscroll
[11:57:51] <ravenzz> can't you disable local scroll on the tabs?
[11:58:01] <Funkt> see thats what i was thinking!
[11:58:04] <mml> is there a way to cause form.submit() to actually POST instead of GET? i have the method attr set appropriately.
[11:58:09] <Funkt> but i would not know how to so that?
[11:58:13] <Funkt> do*
[11:58:39] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm looking for a sort a like plugin that can create the same effect as http://www.usa.philips.com/c/ (background and links sliding exactly the same way)
[11:58:47] <sunbeam> Does anyone know what would be the best plugin for this?
[11:58:48] <Funkt> local scroll looks for anything with a "#" in it
[12:01:58] <mml> huh, wierd, if i create the form with $('<form method="PUT">), it actually does it right, but not when i set attributes on $("<form>")
[12:02:06] <mml> go figure
[12:03:53] <ngharo> sunbeam: jcarousel using "drop" easing

[12:16:36] <toddWork> how do i create  teardown function for the https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/jquery.boilerplate.js
[12:16:39] <toddWork> ?
[12:18:17] <toddWork> oh, removeData() i bet
[12:19:10] <sunbeam> ngharo: is that possible with jcarousel?
[12:19:55] <imachuchu> is there an easy way, using the jquery-autocomplete widget, to clear the dialog if an option isn't selected?
[12:20:18] <imachuchu> *dialog/text box
[12:21:36] <toughguyhlve> .FadeIn = IE9 Hates, .FadeIn = IE7, Totally okay.
[12:21:37] <toughguyhlve>    What in the actual fuck.
[12:21:41] <toughguyhlve> >:/
[12:29:38] <jedimind> toughguyhlve, you should force your site to render in IE7 compat mode
[12:29:45] <jedimind> (that was a joke, dont actually do that)
[12:30:52] <toughguyhlve> :S
[12:30:58] <toughguyhlve> IE7 makes me tear in the eyeballs
[12:31:10] <toughguyhlve> Site doesn't break in IE7 though, which is great
[12:32:05] <Mizzle> I am working with SharePoint site where it is possible that someone has already loaded jQuery and the version would be unknown.  I am deploying javascript code to every page and need to ensure that I am using the latest version of jQuery.  There are 2 issues I want to avoid.  1 is I don't want to interfere with anything that is already using the existing version
[12:32:15] <Mizzle> 2 is that I would prefer not to load jQuery again until I get to a section of my code where I need it.  There is a conditional where I may not even have to use jquery because most of the code won't run anyways.  So I don't want to load it twice every time.
[12:34:35] <sunbeam> does anyone know a way of how i can grab all JS code that's used on a site at once?
[12:34:49] <toughguyhlve> someones trying to rip a site^ X:
[12:35:56] * toughguyhlve slaps sunbeam around a bit with a large trout
[12:36:00] <toughguyhlve> Bad sunbeam, bad.
[12:37:19] <ngharo> Mizzle: you can check window.jQuery and document.write('<script src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script>') if it's undefined
[12:37:38] <ngharo> also read about $.noConflict in the docs
[12:37:41] <SrPx> How to set an element to be the focused one?
[12:37:56] <ngharo> .focus()
[12:38:41] <Mizzle> ok thanks
[12:38:45] <SrPx> no no, this is a handler event, is not it
[12:39:46] <ngharo> wat
[12:41:33] <SrPx> .focus() is a handler to the event of an element being focused, not a way to focus it
[12:42:30] <ngharo> are you sure?
[12:42:50] <ngharo> maybe you should try it
[12:42:55] <toughguyhlve> lol
[12:43:04] <toddWork> i need some help: http://jsfiddle.net/XFe6V/
[12:43:15] <toddWork> i can't get the plugin to work twice.
[12:43:30] <toddWork> i'm assuming i'm not destroying it correctly.
[12:45:06] <toddWork> the destroy function is working, as in the element is removed, but i can't get the plugin to run a second time.
[12:45:41] <Carlitta87> hi, im using his tutorial to create a slideshow....but id like to add a counter... http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/07/01/how-to-create-a-slideshow-plugin-with-jquery/
[12:46:41] <toughguyhlve> a ... counter?
[12:46:45] <toughguyhlve> a timer?
[12:48:02] <toddWork> oh, i got it.
[12:48:19] * toughguyhlve \o's toddWork
[12:53:21] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to append table rows and view them as you run through a for loop, on the screen
[12:53:45] <shoky> what do you mean 'and view them' ?
[12:53:51] <shoky> otherwise, sure
[12:53:54] <jeffsmykil> so in the for loop you are adding a tr each time
[12:54:06] <jeffsmykil> but the screen gets updated on each append
[12:54:14] <shoky> yes
[12:54:22] <jeffsmykil> how
[12:54:30] <shoky> what? just append in the for loop?
[12:55:11] <dabear> you should build the whole set of rows in one go (one append)
[12:55:29] <dabear> it will be a lot better for performance than using an append inside the for loop
[12:55:46] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[12:55:53] <jeffsmykil> the issue is there are thousands of rows
[12:55:56] <jeffsmykil> so that takes a while
[12:56:08] <dabear> jeffsmykil: then do it in steps
[12:56:20] <dabear> for example, for each 300 rows have one append
[12:56:58] <jeffsmykil> that may work
[12:57:40] <jeffsmykil> hrm its like the dom isn't refreshing
[12:58:06] <dabear> if(i%300){ $elem.append(bultString); builtString = "";}
[12:58:10] <dabear> built*
[12:58:55] <jeffsmykil> i wonder if it has something to do with tablesorter
[12:59:01] <shoky> :\
[12:59:24] <dabear> tablesorter might need to be refreshed each time a new row is added
[12:59:39] <dabear> each time a set of new rows are added*
[12:59:43] <jeffsmykil> dabear: that's what i was just thinking
[12:59:52] <jeffsmykil> im actually asking for a co-worker who is stuck
[13:00:10] <dabear> jeffsmykil: see ?reduce
[13:00:21] <dabear> jeffsmykil: and then see ?jsfiddle
[13:00:24] <dabear> bha
[13:00:27] <dabear> bot-t is gone
[13:00:36] <jeffsmykil> yeah I know like i said not my code
[13:00:41] <dabear> anyway, reduce your problem and paste it to jsfiddle
[13:00:41] <jeffsmykil> trying to make a test case for him now
[13:02:24] <jeffsmykil> the real solution imo is we add ajax loading on scroll app wide
[13:03:41] <christo_m> Hello, im ajax loading inside a dialog, divs that contain http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[13:04:00] <christo_m> however, the script thats included on the jquery site gets loaded twice (has multiple instances of input) and thus i get this error
[13:04:14] <christo_m> input.data("autocomplete") is undefined
[13:04:23] <christo_m> is there a way to test in the constructor before creating the object?
[13:04:48] <christo_m> it works on initial load, but if i load another dialog, then go back, it breaks.
[13:07:16] <sunbeam> when you use setInterval(function() { } ); it means that setInterval is automatically executed right?
[13:08:04] <christo_m> sorry this is it: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[13:08:25] <christo_m> i pretty much copied the code there
[13:08:30] <christo_m> and theres a destroy thing , but im not sure how to use it
[13:11:48] <shoky> sunbeam: its automatically executed and re-executed till you clearInterval(..)
[13:25:41] <sunbeam> ok
[13:39:59] <prefixed> is this the proper way to use jQuery.contains? jQuery.contains($(this).closest($('.views-row'), '.jplayer') (the first is the container, and the second is the item which may or may not be contained)
[13:41:05] <sunbeam> how to see all current style rules of a certain element with firebug? does anyone know?
[13:43:12] <freeed> sunbeam, in the dom > inspect section I beleive
[13:43:17] <freeed> *believe
[13:43:58] <sunbeam> freeed: i can't find inspect under DOM
[13:44:30] <freeed> errr 'html' not dom
[13:45:06] <prefixed> how do I need to reqrite this in order to get the variable to just return a value? http://pastebin.com/NtfweyAm
[13:45:15] <freeed> Or just drill down to that element in the html tab - inspect just lets you do it by clicking on the element in the page
[13:54:56] <sunbeam> does anyone know how i can best alter javascript function LIVE with firebug, when i visit a site?
[13:56:49] <prefixed> actually
[13:57:00] <prefixed> what is a "self executing anonomous function"?
[14:01:01] <sjeijk> anonymous sounds like secret as in cia :s
[14:02:26] <ngharo> (function(){}())
[14:07:24] <blendedbychris> is there a decent way to duplicate a fieldset and increase all of it's <input array name.
[14:07:59] <blendedbychris> like <fieldset> <input name="item[0]" would increase to item[1]
[14:10:27] <blendedbychris> or maybe a better way to do this?
[14:11:23] <NackNick> anyone know where I can find a detailed tutorial on ajax, when i say detailed i mean like what the functions do that they are calling in the tutorial
[14:11:48] <blendedbychris> NackNick: jquery manul?
[14:13:38] <ngharo> blendedbychris: clone.find('input').each(function() { this.name = this.name.replace(/\[\d+\]/, '[' + ++fieldsetCount + ']'); });
[14:13:42] <ngharo> somethin like that
[14:13:51] <blendedbychris> ngharo: is that just a dumb way to do this?
[14:14:48] <ngharo> i dunno
[14:15:03] <ngharo> could probably handle it in the submission also
[14:15:36] <ngharo> wrap each fieldset in it's own <form>, serialize all forms and send an array of serialized data to the service
[14:16:13] <blendedbychris> this feels more legit
[14:17:34] <NackNick> blendedbychris: ??
[14:18:04] <ngharo> NackNick: he's referring the the docs at http://api.jquery.com
[14:18:04] <NackNick> you mean this?
[14:18:05] <NackNick> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:18:35] <NackNick> yeah its like 3 books long before you ever even get into coding
[14:19:03] <ngharo> what is your question?
[14:19:05] <NackNick> i need something that tells me while coding
[14:19:16] <ngharo> boy, that would be a nice asset
[14:19:32] <ngharo> sudo make me a genie
[14:20:06] <ngharo> NackNick: some IDEs have built in context help for methods
[14:20:37] <prefixed> ok, so I have this code, which is returning 'undiefined' for nextPlayer (via console.log()) even though it shouldn't be. wtf is goiung on? http://pastebin.com/KJh3aCja
[14:21:55] <ngharo> prefixed: you're defining nextPlayer, then have a function that does things with it, then logging it
[14:22:00] <ngharo> but you never execute the function
[14:22:19] <blendedbychris> this.name = this.name.replace(/\[\d+\]/,  '[' + ++$('.child_line_item').size() + ']'); << does that not look correct?
[14:22:30] <blendedbychris> oh wait i don't want ++
[14:22:36] <prefixed> ngharo is there a way to automatically execture the function there?
[14:23:39] <ngharo> you can just call it: findNext(); right before console.log
[14:23:53] <ngharo> or wrap it in ( .. )();
[14:25:39] <prefixed> ngharo do I need to name the function then?
[14:25:56] <prefixed> or can I just (function() {... } ) ();

[14:26:16] <prefixed> man
[14:26:19] <prefixed> I am learning so much today
[14:27:33] <sviatovigt> how can I select all the checkboxes that are selected?
[14:27:48] <ngharo> $('checkbox:selected')
[14:28:03] <shoky> :checked
[14:28:11] <shoky> :selected is for <option>s
[14:28:14] <ngharo> oh word
[14:28:24] <blendedbychris> ngharo: should taht work in that .clone() ?
[14:28:25] <blendedbychris> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/2pqvjij9dsjq8bgw59gg
[14:28:47] <shoky> does it?
[14:29:03] <blendedbychris> nope it no longer fadesin
[14:29:16] <shoky> how should we know if that works..
[14:30:00] <ngharo> because jayquarry
[14:30:05] <ngharo> blendedbychris: do you get the console.log
[14:30:09] <blendedbychris> the fadein just doesn't work‚Ä¶ should the .each() return an object to be faded in?
[14:30:27] <blendedbychris> i think i should fadein and then .each
[14:30:41] <ngharo> don't you have an extra closing parenth at the end?
[14:30:44] <shoky> .each returns whatever it was run on
[14:30:47] <shoky> yes he does
[14:31:05] <blendedbychris> oh hrm okay let me continue playing with this and figure out what's up thanks
[14:31:14] <shoky> anyway why are you fading in a cloned element that you didnt add to the DOM yet
[14:31:32] <ngharo> because jayquarry
[14:31:39] <shoky> haw haw
[14:31:45] <ngharo> :)
[14:32:10] <shoky> ;->
[14:32:19] <blendedbychris> shoky: i didn't include the after( )
[14:32:50] <blendedbychris> let me regather my problem though
[14:33:44] <shoky> jsfiddle though
[14:34:07] <shoky> that way you'll include everything...
[14:34:17] <blendedbychris> so something like $('.child_line_item').last().after($('.child_line_item').first().clone()); << can i add your .find() to that clone even because it seems to clone the inputs instead
[14:34:42] <shoky> whose .find() ?
[14:34:42] <blendedbychris> okay let me compile something
[14:34:50] <blendedbychris> ngharo:
[14:34:57] <ngharo> yeah fiddle plz
[14:35:24] <shoky> adding that .after() doesnt help btw, you're still not adding the cloned one to the DOM
[14:37:03] <shoky> oh sry btw, didnt notice you were continuing a problem you two have already been discussing
[14:37:57] <blendedbychris> i dunno i have it working now but‚Ä¶ i unchained some of it to make sense
[14:38:09] <PilotBob> Anyone have an idea why when a datepicker is attached to an element with a div surrounding it with overflow: visible it displays offset a certain amount of pixels
[14:38:41] <blendedbychris> ngharo:  $('.child_line_item').last().after($('.child_line_item').first().clone()).fadeIn();  << oddly i can put the .fadeIn() there or after .clone() no problem
[14:38:51] <blendedbychris> ^^ that's more just fyi
[14:39:44] <blendedbychris> what's the proper way to subtract 1 from this $('.child_line_item').size() - 1 << that returns NaN
[14:40:05] <blendedbychris> i tried $('.child_line_item').children().length too
[14:40:19] <shoky> that's the proper way..
[14:40:26] <ngharo> .size() === .length
[14:41:33] <blendedbychris> ah
[14:42:39] <ngharo> although you should never get NaN from .length on the jq object
[14:43:53] <blendedbychris> in a .replace it ends up return NaN works fine otherwise >> this.name.replace(/\[\d+\]/,  '[' + $('.child_line_item').size() - 1 + ']'
[14:45:02] <prefixed> what is a [] element equal to?
[14:45:20] <snover> itself
[14:45:23] <snover> was that a trick question?
[14:45:27] <blendedbychris> haha
[14:45:35] <prefixed> it isn't null?
[14:45:54] <snover> ?101 @ prefixed
[14:45:58] <snover> ugh
[14:45:58] <snover> bot-t
[14:46:08] <ngharo> :[
[14:46:10] <snover> prefixed: http://eloquentjavascript.net
[14:46:14] <prefixed> snover don't bother, not going to read it right now.
[14:46:21] <prefixed> I have that book open
[14:46:46] <snover> ok, I won‚Äôt bother to help
[14:46:48] <snover> sorry for helping!
[14:46:52] <shoky> he already bothered, dummy
[14:47:34] <prefixed> actually I'm reading http://jqfundamentals.com/
[14:47:49] <shoky> [] and null are not jquery related
[14:47:58] <blendedbychris> http://jsfiddle.net/X5vLC/ << that's the weird NaN problem
[14:47:58] <prefixed> didn't meant o be a dick btw, just having a touch time getting jquery to do what I want it to do
[14:48:24] <snover> yeah, and you will until you spend time to learn some of the fundamentals, and eloquent javascript is a great way to do that :)
[14:48:52] <shoky> blendedbychris: where are you getting NaN
[14:49:10] <blendedbychris> shoky: hit "foo" and the <input reutns NaN
[14:49:11] <shoky> uhh blendedbychris: what is $(this).preventDefault();  ??
[14:49:20] <blendedbychris> bleh i normally have return false;
[14:49:25] <shoky> no, i get: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'preventDefault'
[14:49:28] <blendedbychris> but i was trying not to get castrated
[14:49:42] <blendedbychris> http://jsfiddle.net/X5vLC/1/
[14:49:44] <blendedbychris> there heh
[14:49:54] <shoky> where is the NaN
[14:50:03] <blendedbychris> hit foo and look at the name[]
[14:50:15] <shoky> anyway
[14:50:17] <shoky> you lied
[14:50:24] <shoky> you're doing:   '[' + $('.child_line_item').size() - 1
[14:50:32] <shoky> '['  is a string
[14:50:37] <shoky>  '[' + $('.child_line_item').size()    is also a string
[14:50:44] <shoky> hence  string - 1 == NaN
[14:50:56] <blendedbychris> oh i thought it would parse that inward
[14:51:01] <shoky> why not fiddle BEFORE asking questions
[14:51:27] <shoky> or ask questions without omitting such details......
[14:52:13] <blendedbychris> trust me ‚Ä¶ i just prefer to waste your time
[14:52:18] <shoky> seems that way
[14:52:25] <shoky> yours as well
[14:52:29] <blendedbychris> indeed
[14:52:34] <blendedbychris> anyway thanks

[15:00:42] <Ziber> I have a JQuery script that gets a list of things from a PHP script. Next to each one, I want to generate a checkbox. Best way to do that?
[15:03:37] <catcher> Ziber, you can use prepend() to attach the input elements
[15:03:47] <catcher> if they're already in the DOM, that is
[15:04:03] <catcher> or if you have the collection already in jquery
[15:09:04] <antnash> Hey guys. I'm having issues with a blur event triggering twice, so instead of if(code==13) $(this).blur() I did the following... http://pastebin.com/jSA4Dbtg and now it doesn't blur at all
[15:24:15] <shoky> $(document).focus(); ?
[15:24:42] <shoky> what behaviour are you after
[15:24:54] <tw2113> shoky did i ever link you to that resulting post i typed up?
[15:25:02] <shoky> nopes
[15:25:08] <shoky> not that i saw anhyway
[15:26:20] <antnash> shoky: I'm after something that will change the focus away from $(this), without triggering the blur event twice, which is what $(this).blur() seems to be doing
[15:35:51] <Lucky--> Any of you guys ever have to deal with skype's click to call js crashing all the time?

[15:45:40] <antnash> shoky: Seems a bit of a hack, but works great. Ta!
[15:46:14] <shoky> what you're doing is a hack to begin with, so.
[15:46:47] <shoky> focusing another element just so that the blur happens so that your code in the handler will run

[18:08:49] <Ziber> I'm trying to put checkboxes next to all elements of an array that I'm listing out, but seemingly having trouble. http://sandbox.liber.in/cr/network.php - anyone mind helping? (if you click list networks, you'll see how its messing up)
[18:28:47] <shoky> Ziber: what's the ajax call returning?
[18:28:50] <shoky> (exactly)
[18:29:12] <shoky> i mean what the server is responding
[18:29:44] <Ziber> its a json array of listed networks.
[18:30:41] <shoky> yes i could tell that from the code
[18:30:51] <shoky> but what is it returning, exactly?
[18:31:57] <Ziber> [{"nid":"n_VWuPbZf9R2","domain":"liber.in","created":"2012-05-25 21:06:16"},{"nid":"n_Dx8o0Ax2he","domain":"jkurtz.net","created":"2012-05-25 21:05:49"}]
[18:38:13] <shoky> and what is data.length ?
[18:39:30] <shoky> nm
[18:40:55] <shoky> oh
[18:41:01] <Ziber> ?
[18:41:01] <shoky> $("#networkList").html($("#networkList").text() + "<br><br>" + output);
[18:41:10] <shoky> the .text() is the problem..
[18:41:16] <Ziber> duh
[18:41:16] <shoky> it only gets test, not html
[18:41:17] <shoky> text
[18:41:22] <Ziber> i made that mistake before, lol
[18:41:23] <Ziber> thanks
[18:41:24] <shoky> ;p
[18:41:25] <shoky> np
[18:41:42] <shoky> you should use .append() instead, anyway
[18:42:44] <Ziber> well, prepend, but yeah you're right.
[18:43:43] <shoky> nah, append :)
[18:44:06] <Ziber> huh okay
[18:44:44] <shoky> you're adding output to the end, not the beginning of the list
[18:44:49] <Ziber> now its not doing anything...
[18:49:09] <shoky> uhh
[18:49:16] <shoky> cause look at what you're appending :)
[18:49:31] <Ziber> :)

[18:49:41] <shoky> ;-p
[18:49:46] <Dolemike> I am trying to come up with an easy way to replace a script tag that is set to load jquery before it executes.  Basically if I find it in a script tag in a master page, I want to remove it so I can control the version that gets loaded.
[18:50:30] <shoky> btw Ziber
[18:50:32] <shoky> sec
[18:50:39] <Ziber> ?
[18:59:03] <shoky> heh i was just gonna make it cleaner for you but got sidetracked, nvm
[19:00:17] <Ziber> if I want to do events on these, I should be able to, right?
[19:00:52] <shoky> yup
[19:01:36] <Ziber> $(".classOfTheCheckboxes").click(function() { // do stuff }); ?
[19:02:07] <shoky> that depends when you run that
[19:02:14] <shoky> you might want to look at event delegation with .on()
[19:02:35] <shoky> so that you can set up event handlers even before your checkboxes are in the DOM
[19:02:51] <Ziber> I want to run the event when the checkbox is checked.
[19:02:56] <shoky> but if you run that .click(...)  on the checkboxes AFTER they're already in the DOM then it should also work
[19:03:09] <Ziber> is there a benefit to before?
[19:03:10] <shoky> yeah but i meant when you actually call .click
[19:03:54] <shoky> there's a benefit to event delegation in that you can set up just one event handler on one 'container' element, instead of 200 handlers on 200 checkboxes
[19:04:01] <shoky> for example
[19:08:00] <Ziber> ?
[19:08:07] <shoky> ?
[19:08:14] <systemfault> If all events could bubble‚Ä¶. I'd only use event delegation :P
[19:08:56] <shoky> which don't?
[19:10:22] <Ziber> im confused as to what you mean.
[19:10:45] <systemfault> shoky: focus.. blur for example.
[19:10:57] <shoky> oh
[19:11:08] <shoky> Ziber: that's why you should read about it
[19:11:14] <shoky> ?on @ Ziber
[19:11:14] <bot-t> Ziber, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:12:00] <systemfault> shoky: I think they're the only one nowadays‚Ä¶ but more of them don't work on IE only IIRC
[19:12:19] <shoky> gotcha
[19:12:32] <shoky> didn't know that
[19:12:34] <Ziber> $("#element").on('event', function() { // do stuff }); ?
[19:12:49] <shoky> Ziber: that's not using event delegation
[19:13:06] * Ziber reads
[19:13:19] <shoky> Ziber:  $('#container').on('event', '.classOfCheckboxes', function() { stuff } );
[19:13:32] <shoky> but, read the part about event delegation
[19:14:01] <systemfault> I still say that using .on for event delegation is a very bad idea‚Ä¶ too confusing.
[19:14:12] <systemfault> (I do it nevertheless)
[19:14:24] <shoky> it's confusing for you because you were used to a different way, no?
[19:14:48] <systemfault> shoky: It's not confusing to me because I understand the difference.
[19:14:50] <shoky> for me who only really got on the jquery train after 1.7, it is very intuitive
[19:15:05] <shoky> i don't see how it would be confusing for someone new to jquery
[19:15:25] <systemfault> shoky: It's damn easy to see.. you have a single function with 2 different purposes.
[19:15:29] <raj> systemfault, what's confusing about it?
[19:15:56] <shoky> systemfault: you have a single function with 1 purpose: to bind event handlers to elements
[19:16:01] <systemfault> Normal event handling and event delegation should, imho, be two different functions.
[19:16:19] <Ziber> can someone explain the difference between handling and delegating, please?
[19:16:26] <systemfault> Ziber: Sure
[19:16:31] <raj> systemfault, the handling is in the callback
[19:16:36] <raj> what's "delegation"?
[19:16:39] <systemfault> Ziber: Do you know what "event bubbling" is?
[19:17:04] <Ziber> systemfault: Not exactly, no.
[19:17:12] <shoky> raj: he means that with delegation, the event handler is bound to an element , but it handles events for other elements
[19:17:39] <raj> how does it handle events for other elements?
[19:17:44] <shoky> Ziber: another recommended read about events: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[19:17:54] <raj> i usually select a parent, and then get more specific within .on( )
[19:18:14] <raj> it's a great feature
[19:18:15] <shoky> well that's delegation ;p
[19:18:27] <raj> life would suck without it, actually
[19:18:28] <shoky> the handler is bound to the container element
[19:18:35] <systemfault> raj: Indeed.
[19:18:36] <raj> right
[19:18:37] <shoky> but the event "belongs" to a different one
[19:18:38] <raj> i like that
[19:18:46] <shoky> so its handling the event for someone else
[19:18:48] <shoky> =delegation
[19:18:55] <raj> systemfault, what would you like it to look like, syntactically?
[19:19:06] <shoky> he wants it to be  .bind  and .delegate, i believe
[19:19:10] <Ziber> do you have a div or something, with a bunch of tags inside that can be all evented. so maybe like $("#parent").on('click', '.class', function() { }); ?
[19:19:26] <systemfault> shoky: Personally? .on for normal events .delegate for event delegation
[19:19:33] <shoky> Ziber: exactly
[19:19:41] <shoky> systemfault: yeah same idea
[19:19:49] <raj> systemfault, let me see you write out an example using .delegate and .bind or whatever you'd prefer
[19:19:52] <shoky> the thing is
[19:19:55] <shoky> with .delegate
[19:20:00] <Ziber> shoky: What's the benenfit between that and .click() or .bind('click', function() { }); ?
[19:20:01] <shoky> the method name
[19:20:04] <shoky> has nothing to do with events
[19:20:08] <shoky> that is more confusing imo.
[19:20:13] <systemfault> Ziber: Same thing, .click is a shortcut
[19:20:31] <systemfault> Ziber: Hmm‚Ä¶ wait...
[19:20:38] <systemfault> Ziber: What is "that" ?
[19:20:58] <Ziber> .on()
[19:21:05] <shoky> Ziber: first of all, if you only have one event handler instead of 200 then it consumes less memory
[19:21:09] <shoky> less resources
[19:21:38] <Ziber> but couldnt i just have a bunch of checkboxes with the same class name and do $(".class").click(function() { }); ?
[19:21:39] <shoky> Ziber: with .click or .bind you'd have to have one event handler per checkbox (in your case)
[19:21:46] <shoky> you could
[19:21:55] <systemfault> Ziber: Sure‚Ä¶ it's a lot heavier though
[19:21:55] <Ziber> that way wouldnt i just have one event handler?
[19:22:01] <Ziber> heavier?
[19:22:02] <shoky> but that would bind ALL those checkboxes seperately
[19:22:06] <systemfault> Ziber: No, one for every checkbox
[19:22:13] <Dr-Bombay> death to w3schools
[19:22:14] <Ziber> oooh
[19:22:16] <Ziber> okay
[19:22:22] <Ziber> just less memory this way
[19:22:26] <Ziber> alright, gotcha.
[19:22:44] <shoky> Ziber and also with event delegation you don't need to add .click handlers each time you add something new to the DOM
[19:22:57] <shoky> you can just set it up once in your DOM ready or whatever and forget about it
[19:23:00] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: Yeah.. it's very bad.
[19:23:20] <shoky> w3fools.com are too nice imo ;)
[19:23:46] <Ziber> shoky: explain that?
[19:24:22] <shoky> Ziber: if you do $(".class").click(function() { });  whenever
[19:24:35] <shoky> and then you add more checkboxes to the dom (after some  ajax call ..)
[19:24:44] <shoky> then those new checkboxes wouldnt trigger the handler
[19:24:47] <shoky> you'd have to call .click AGAIN
[19:24:55] <shoky> try it
[19:25:02] <shoky> then try it with .on and event delegation
[19:25:04] <Ziber> so, in my case, im adding checkboxes, so what are you suggesting?
[19:25:06] <shoky> see the difference for yourself
[19:25:16] <Ziber> but the .on in my dom ready function?
[19:25:17] <shoky> we're suggesting using .on with event delegation
[19:25:19] <shoky> yeah
[19:25:22] <Ziber> okay
[19:25:39] <systemfault> shoky: See? ;) That's the problem with a function that has two purposes.
[19:25:53] <shoky> :) yeah i suppose. but i dont like the name .delegate
[19:26:34] <shoky> so find a better one and im with you ;p
[19:26:39] <systemfault> Haha :D
[19:26:48] <systemfault> shoky: I use use .on personally :P
[19:27:49] <shoky> well really the best solution imo is to keep .on as it is, but not deprecate .delegate()   (and change its name)
[19:28:01] <shoky> that way you wouldn't feel bad telling someone to use .delegate
[19:28:06] <shoky> and everyone's happy
[19:28:23] <ngharo> .wiggle()
[19:28:28] <shoky> +1
[19:33:55] <Ziber> Hm.
[19:34:05] <systemfault> Ziber: http://jsfiddle.net/9rRQ5/
[19:34:17] <systemfault> Ziber: I hope it will help a bit to understand bubbling.
[19:34:54] <Ziber> Alright, I got .on working, but having trouble with $(this).val(),
[19:35:04] <Ziber> its saying "on".
[19:35:32] <systemfault> Ziber: Could you show us your code^
[19:35:55] <Ziber> http://sandbox.liber.in/cr/network.php
[19:37:21] <systemfault> Ziber: the attribute name is "value" and not "val"
[19:37:31] <systemfault> Ziber: On your checkboxes.
[19:37:37] <Ziber> ahhh, okay
[19:38:01] <Ziber> Hm, not working still.
[19:38:37] <systemfault> No no no no
[19:38:41] <ngharo> HEHE
[19:38:46] <systemfault> Ziber: The jquery function is .val()
[19:39:00] <systemfault> Ziber: But in the markup, the attribute is value and not val
[19:39:06] <shoky> EHE EHE
[19:39:11] <Ziber> Oh.
[19:40:25] <Ziber> thanks
[19:41:02] <systemfault> :D
[19:48:02] <Guest78343> i'm having some trouble implementing an infinitely scrolling list. there are 4 items in the list, and everything works fine unless you try and jump 3 at a time, in which case some of the images/layers end up overlapping. anybody care to take a look? you can see the page at http://www.solidodesign.com/page/in-progress/
[19:49:21] <Guest78343> the main lines are :122-137
[20:22:02] <shoky> Guest78343: the main slider ?
[20:22:22] <shoky> seems to be working fine
[20:23:40] <Guest78343> shoky: it messes up if you go backwards/click the 1 previous
[20:24:35] <Guest78343> shoky: gah, i just changed the code to try and fix something, but it's still failing sometimes
[20:24:49] <shoky> not sure what you mean..
[20:25:08] <shoky> i saw a glitch for one sec but otherwise it seems fine
[20:25:46] <shoky> er ok now its weird
[20:26:03] <Guest78343> shoky: i think you're looking at my most recent fix. i made 2 separate functions because i'm getting more and more frustrated
[20:26:10] <Guest78343> shoky: i think i just solved it locally, will upload
[20:26:28] <shoky> o
[20:28:01] <shoky> getting an empty slide sometimes
[20:28:32] <Guest78343> shoky: that's the problem =/
[20:28:42] <shoky> you're animating each slide by itself?
[20:28:47] <Guest78343> shoky: sometimes when you click through it doesn't get set properly
[20:28:48] <Guest78343> shoky: yeah
[20:28:52] <shoky> why
[20:29:07] <Guest78343> shoky: how do you fake infinite without doing that?
[20:29:17] <shoky> oh
[20:29:48] <shoky> well you could always just change their order before sliding, no?
[20:30:20] <Guest78343> i had it working originally with infinite, but it only worked going by 1 slide at a time. then the client wanted clickable links, so i made it non-infinite. now he wants the auto-incrementing to look infinite, and now there are weird problems
[20:30:22] <shoky> i mean, shift around the 4
[20:30:25] <Guest78343> hmm maybe
[20:30:41] <shoky> lemme see if i find the issue with how youre doing it tho
[20:30:59] <Guest78343> what would the best way to shift them around be?
[20:31:36] <shoky> at one time all you really care about is only 2 photos
[20:31:47] <shoky> 2 slides
[20:32:13] <styol> another approach might be [1][2][3][1] skip back to the real 1 before transitioning to 2
[20:32:19] <shoky> shift them around with .detach() and .append() or something, i guess
[20:33:02] <shoky> yeah that'd work if you only care about going in one direction
[20:33:07] <shoky> which i think you do
[20:33:39] <shoky> what i mean is you dont need to shift from [1] "up" to [3]
[20:33:47] <Guest78343> yeah
[20:33:48] <shoky> so that approach is fine
[20:34:01] <shoky> but me, i'd only focus on the 2 slides i care about on each slide
[20:34:12] <Guest78343> the programming concepts are fine, it's just javascript i'm not so great at
[20:34:14] <shoky> i like to deal with the minimum needed
[20:34:26] <shoky> well that's what you're here for ;p
[20:34:38] <Guest78343> yup!
[20:47:43] <Guest78343> shoky: why would i be getting an 'has no method 'detach'' error?
[20:50:33] <systemfault> Because you're calling detach on a non-jquery object‚Ä¶ most likely a DOM node.
[21:02:15] <camroth> is this not correct? $('#slides').detach()
[21:02:19] <camroth> it works if i use remove() =/
[21:04:26] <shoky> seems fine..
[21:04:41] <shoky> the element is still in the DOM after .detach() ?
[21:05:31] <camroth> i get an error in the console
[21:05:44] <shoky> yes?
[21:06:25] <shoky> you're Guest78343?
[21:06:26] <camroth> yes
[21:06:31] <camroth> yeah
[21:06:31] <shoky> ok
[21:06:36] <systemfault> When you detach a node.. it's just detached from the main DOM tree...
[21:07:09] <shoky> camroth:  $('#slides').remove()  works fine,  but $('#slides').detach()  gives you an error?
[21:07:16] <camroth> shoky: correct
[21:07:21] <camroth> "TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'detach'"
[21:07:22] <shoky> what jquery version are you on?
[21:07:29] <systemfault> 0.1 !
[21:07:32] <systemfault> j/k
[21:07:32] <shoky> :)
[21:07:33] <camroth> let me check
[21:07:38] <camroth> 1.3.2 min
[21:07:40] <shoky> yeah ;)
[21:07:45] <shoky> .detach() is from 1.4
[21:07:50] <camroth> that would do it!
[21:07:52] <shoky> plz2upgrade
[21:08:07] <camroth> wait
[21:08:12] <camroth> i'm using the latest link i pulled from google
[21:08:19] <camroth> :(
[21:08:24] <systemfault> 1.3.2 is prehistoric.
[21:08:26] <shoky> wat
[21:08:27] <shoky> 1.7.2 plz
[21:08:29] <systemfault> 1.4 is old.
[21:08:54] <camroth> weird, i have 1.8.18 jquery ui
[21:08:54] <camroth> how did i end up with 1.3.2
[21:09:05] <shoky> werd
[21:24:48] <dpac_> Hey guys is there a way to select elements after a specific element. For eg; I want to do something like this foo = $('.somerow').parent(), now can I select elements from foo?
[21:25:21] <scr3am> .next() ???
[21:26:42] <dpac_> Nothing like foo('.anotherelement') ?
[21:26:57] <scr3am> ahh, sure you can
[21:27:40] <scr3am> $(foo)
[21:28:43] <camroth> shoky: thanks for your help!
[21:29:21] <rohanrhu> hi
[21:29:25] <rohanrhu> i need help
[21:29:40] <rohanrhu> how can i inherit this to a function?
[21:30:19] <dpac_> scr3am:  I didn't quite get that
[21:30:54] <rohanrhu> a this is available in a function and im calling another function in the function and i want pass this to called function
[21:32:49] <systemfault> rohanrhu: You could use call
[21:32:51] <scr3am> dpac_: you could also "chain" more like foo = $('.somerow').parent().siblings(<whatever>).find('input')...
[21:33:02] <rohanrhu> systemfault: call? $.call?
[21:33:10] <systemfault> rohanrhu: myFunction.call(this, argument1, argument2‚Ä¶..)
[21:33:22] <rohanrhu> systemfault: im trying
[21:33:35] <systemfault> rohanrhu: That's pure JS, not jQuery
[21:33:54] <rohanrhu> systemfault: yes it works thanks a lot
[21:34:08] <dpac_> scr3am: Ahh I see, thanks :)
[21:34:36] <scr3am> dpac_: np, cool
[21:34:48] <camroth> shoky: if you check the link it should be working now, thanks for bouncing ideas off me!
[21:35:18] <shoky> camroth: got a white slide ;p
[21:35:24] <camroth> what? refresh!
[21:35:30] <shoky> i did
[21:35:38] <camroth> just now?
[21:35:43] <shoky> before it starts sliding i clicked the 3rd item
[21:36:03] <camroth> my internet is so slow right now :(
[21:36:20] <camroth> damn
[21:36:45] <camroth> when i was testing i was using a way shorter delay so i missed it
[21:36:56] <shoky> camroth: ah now i also see that my 'solution' with only using 2 slides loses the effect of sliding through the other slides
[21:37:15] <Lucky--> need advice: throw this in my htm page and run it as php (the only php period) or throw it in a seperate php page and use json to query it. the vars are mission critical. http://pastebin.com/1Fs7aUJ8 ?
[21:37:16] <shoky> and also you're always sliding down
[21:37:50] <shoky> Lucky--: whut?
[21:37:53] <rohanrhu> systemfault: how can i queue of the a html element in a html element?
[21:38:04] <camroth> shoky: now?
[21:38:08] <rohanrhu> systemfault: how can i get* queue of the a html element in a html element?
[21:38:16] <Lucky--> shoky: i converted all of my php to js
[21:38:39] <shoky> camroth: its fine now (but still only sliding downwards)
[21:38:54] <shoky> rohanrhu: what queue
[21:38:59] <camroth> shoky: that's fine, i think that's what he wanted. he for sure wanted it to do that on the loop around
[21:38:59] <systemfault> rohanrhu: I don't understand what you mean by "queue"
[21:39:22] <rohanrhu> systemfault shoky queue number, line rumber, row number
[21:39:23] <shoky> camroth: nah i would change that, it's even disorienting when you click one that is above but it slides down
[21:39:36] <shoky> rohanrhu: huh?
[21:39:39] <systemfault> rohanrhu: I don't get it :(
[21:39:41] <camroth> that's how i felt when going from the bottom to the top, but he wanted it down
[21:39:47] <rohanrhu> <div><div><div><div> -> example: 3. div
[21:40:00] <shoky> camroth: weirdo
[21:40:08] <rohanrhu> systemfault shoky N. html elemen :) i want get N
[21:40:18] <shoky> whaaaaa
[21:40:34] <shoky> that's 4 divs
[21:40:43] <shoky> what is:  3. div
[21:40:44] <shoky> ?!
[21:40:58] <Dr-Bombay> wrong, there are 5
[21:41:07] <shoky> eep
[21:41:33] <rohanrhu> shoky: no 3. div's object in here and i must get 3
[21:41:37] <Dr-Bombay> the torture will continue until you can see them all
[21:41:56] <systemfault> I guess he could use nth-child(3) :/
[21:43:12] <systemfault> rohanrhu: Seems that your markup is bad‚Ä¶ or something's wrong.
[21:43:33] <camroth> or a little of both
[21:43:36] <scr3am> systemfault: or it's drupal
[21:43:46] <systemfault> AHhhh
[21:43:51] <systemfault> That explains it.
[21:44:01] <scr3am> (joking) i don't know
[21:44:07] <rohanrhu> a div selected and selection called a function. div in the function and just i must get that html element's N number, N like 3th element
[21:44:56] <Eshu> Hey Wht's up Guy's
[21:45:54] <shoky> mah foo
[21:46:40] <shoky> rohanrhu: maybe you mean .index() ?
[21:46:49] <rohanrhu> shoky: yes
[21:46:59] <shoky> ok so .index()
[21:47:04] <rohanrhu> index of html element in all elements
[21:47:15] <shoky> $(element).index()
[21:47:22] <rohanrhu> shoky: thank you :)
[21:47:23] <shoky> in all elements?
[21:47:47] <shoky> .index() gets the index within sibling elements
[21:48:24] <rohanrhu> i must get div's index in other divs
[21:49:59] <Dr-Bombay> apparently nothing fragments a hard disk quite like video editing
[21:55:36] <rohanrhu> shoky systemfault thank you
[21:55:45] <systemfault> :)
[22:15:43] <patrickvw> anyone familiar with validationEngine?
[22:26:28] <rohanrhu> systemfault shoky
[22:26:40] <rohanrhu> how can i access global variable in eval()?
[22:27:15] <systemfault> I don't know‚Ä¶ I never used eval.
[22:30:36] <shoky> rohanrhu: don't use eval
[22:31:07] <rohanrhu> shoky: eval("properties['rows'] = " + json_data + ";"); is there another way?
[22:31:17] <shoky> of course..
[22:31:45] <shoky> properties['rows'] = $.parseJSON(json_data)
[22:33:37] <rohanrhu> shoky: thank you
[22:33:54] <shoky> np
[22:35:19] <rohanrhu> shoky: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}'
[22:35:42] <shoky> what does json_data look like
[22:36:17] <shoky> (not what you think it looks like. do console.log(json_data) right before the $.parseJSON )
[22:36:43] <rohanrhu> http://pastebin.com/shG0Diu8
[22:36:46] <sophistoelemento> whatsup, i didnt now anyone used mirc nowadays
[22:36:52] <sophistoelemento> been on after 7 years
[22:37:06] <shoky> rohanrhu: ok that's an array, not a JSON object
[22:37:29] <rohanrhu> shoky: what do i must do :)
[22:37:43] <shoky> uhh
[22:38:13] <shoky> where is the json_data coming from
[22:38:35] <shoky> best would me to make it into a valid json object string
[22:39:13] <shoky> such as:  { "data": [{....}, {.....}] }
[22:39:25] <shoky> i think
[22:42:31] <rohanrhu> shoky: yes sorry thank you :)
[22:43:16] <scr3am> rohanrhu: on what are you working?
[22:43:51] <rohanrhu> scr3am: gui toolkit
[22:44:03] <rohanrhu> scr3am: im writing grid now

[22:47:54] <rohanrhu> scr3am: thank you
[22:51:00] <Lucky--> http://jsfiddle.net/grippstick/YKA2c/34/ any ideas as to why the middle 3 digits aren't being extracted by substring?
[22:52:10] <Lucky--> weird got it working with 6,3
[22:53:23] <shoky> ????
[23:23:36] <rohanrhu> systemfault shoky
[23:24:07] <rohanrhu> is there any pure way for creating gradients with html5?
[23:24:49] <systemfault> rohanrhu: With CSS3 yes
[23:24:56] <systemfault> rohanrhu: www.css3generator.com
[23:25:09] <rohanrhu> systemfault: thank you
[23:29:51] <poppiez> what's the best naming convention? openDialog or dialogOpen?
[23:29:55] <poppiez> noun vs. verb
[23:32:58] <poppiez> e.g., jquery, uses getScript, getOffset but they also use ajaxConvert
[23:37:17] <paulus> test
