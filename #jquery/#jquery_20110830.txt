[00:00:19] <fandio> mustache (and things like it) would help me because.. why, exactly?
[00:00:42] <natrixnatrix89> how do you call that plugin, when you hover mouse over the right edge of an img, it shows a button to go to next img, but when you hover over left side of img, it shows a button to go to previous?
[00:00:42] <coldhead> firstly because javascript is shit at string manipulation
[00:00:49] <coldhead> no multiline strings
[00:00:52] <coldhead> no interpolation
[00:01:06] <coldhead> secondly because you want to keep your JS just JS
[00:01:08] <fandio> my data lives either in Django's database (available during pre-processing) or in JS's state (not avail. during preprocessing)
[00:01:11] <coldhead> and put your html in html files
[00:01:17] <coldhead> right
[00:01:45] <violence> JUSSST in case
[00:02:06] <fandio> i'm afraid I don't understand how mustache would be useful for me. could you give me a specific example? (Perhaps related to my code -- generally speaking).
[00:02:08] <coldhead> so the hot way to work these days is to send templates to your client, send the database data to the client in JSON and send a little js to render the templates with the JSON data
[00:02:24] <coldhead> sure, fandio, gimme a sec
[00:02:33] <coldhead> shuutup violence
[00:03:12] <datarecall> hello
[00:03:32] <datarecall> I need to reload the current page in jquery but I need to add sortby=date to the url string whats the best way to do that
[00:04:28] <violence> :c
[00:06:59] <datarecall> jQuery(location).attr('href'); doesnt seem to work
[00:09:02] <coldhead> fandio: http://jsfiddle.net/ghb5z/
[00:09:15] <coldhead> trivial example but it shows what i'm getting at
[00:09:49] <coldhead> datarecall: that would only work for a hypothetical <location> tag
[00:10:13] <coldhead> if you want to redirect the browser just use JS: window.location = 'something';
[00:11:16] <datarecall> well i want to add window.location +'&sortby=date';
[00:11:20] <datarecall> and refresh
[00:11:46] <coldhead> window.location = window.location + 'etc';
[00:11:48] <coldhead> that will refresh
[00:11:51] <coldhead> all by itself
[00:11:56] <coldhead> WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
[00:12:22] <coldhead> maybe you should use window.location.href
[00:12:27] <coldhead> although both seem to work
[00:12:33] <datarecall> yeah testing that one out now
[00:12:52] <anli_> window.location.href must be a mistake
[00:12:59] <anli_> Not to use, but that it was introduced
[00:13:48] <fandio> coldhead: oh now I'm beggining to see how this all works
[00:13:52] <coldhead> fandio: http://jsfiddle.net/ghb5z/1/
[00:14:05] <fandio> it's a very different idiom than what I'm used to
[00:14:06] <coldhead> that's a slightly less trivial example to show the setting of an attribute as well as regular text
[00:14:17] <coldhead> yeah, but do you see the sense in it?
[00:14:55] <fandio> i do indeed, I just don't think it would jive very well with Django
[00:15:17] <fandio> since going from django's DB -> JSON is a bitch
[00:15:38] <coldhead> oh blergh
[00:15:50] <coldhead> and the first google hit for jquery django tmpl is
[00:15:53] <coldhead> "jquery template tags conflict with Django template!"
[00:15:59] <fandio> LOL
[00:16:06] <fandio> well, yeah. django sucks sometimes
[00:16:22] <fandio> but i thank you for showing me the light of client-side JS templates
[00:16:55] <fandio> i'm sure i'll use them for another project -- for now i'll just try and clean up my existing code and making it less awful
[00:17:42] <coldhead> you might still be able to borrow some concepts if not the whole package
[00:18:12] <coldhead> and you may freely quote me on how much JS sucks at string manipulation
[00:18:21] <coldhead> you want to do as little of that as possible
[00:18:36] <coldhead> there's not even a sprintf for gawds sake
[00:18:46] <trickz> i cant do function hello(mode = 'off'){//more code} ?
[00:18:48] <gnarf> fandio: what is the "name" of these inputs?
[00:19:11] <datarecall> hmm ok so i got it to work but the problem is if they sort it again its adding sort_by onto the end of the url again so its sort_by=date&sort_by=price :|
[00:19:19] <fandio> coldhead: yeah that would make my life considerably less miserable
[00:19:24] <fandio> gnarf: what do you mean?
[00:19:35] <fandio> it's just stuff like item1, item2, etc
[00:19:37] <trickz> hello people, can someone help me with my question i asked before ?
[00:19:51] <fandio> the same fields repeated over and over
[00:20:24] <gnarf> <input name="something[1][name]"> ?
[00:20:39] <trickz> gnarf: can you help me ?
[00:20:59] <coldhead> ?eval function hello(arg) { if (! arg) arg = "mom"; alert("hi " + arg);}; hello();
[00:21:16] <coldhead> trickz: ^^
[00:21:22] <trickz> i cannot do arg = 'mom' ?
[00:21:22] <coldhead> thanks for nothing, bot-t
[00:21:33] <coldhead> not in the function declaration, no
[00:21:39] <bot-t> coldhead: "hi mom"
[00:21:39] * bot-t sighs
[00:21:41] <trickz> dont you think that sucks ?
[00:21:52] <gnarf> trickz: nope
[00:21:59] <fandio> i do :/
[00:22:01] <trickz> why not ?
[00:22:05] <coldhead> yeah i miss it
[00:22:12] <fandio> gnarf: not sure what that question is asking
[00:22:19] <coldhead> but it lets you do more gomblicated things to build your own args in the fn
[00:22:26] <gnarf> fandio: do your inputs have "names" that are used for submission?
[00:22:28] <coldhead> if they're not provided
[00:22:37] <gnarf> because that makes this whole problem like 100* easier
[00:22:43] <fandio> gnarf: no because I don't actually submit the form
[00:22:49] <trickz> ok, so you cant do this in js, fine
[00:22:50] <coldhead> if you don't provide arg it justs gets the value 'undefined'
[00:22:57] <fandio> i run rings around the DOM and squueze JSON out of it
[00:22:57] <gnarf> fandio: but you do... just using some ajax bs
[00:23:04] <trickz> "undefined: ok
[00:23:09] <trickz> thank you
[00:23:13] <fandio> gnarf: yeah I get around it with string mangling and loops
[00:23:23] <gnarf> fandio: which is wholelly unneccesary
[00:23:29] <fandio> i agree completely
[00:23:38] <fandio> gnarf: what would you suggest I do differently?
[00:23:42] <trickz> coldhead: and it is safe to use !arg when arg is udnefined ? so that iut gives tryue ?
[00:23:53] <coldhead> yes, trickz
[00:23:56] <trickz> or typeof arg === "undefined"
[00:23:57] <datarecall> coldhead any thoughts on why this isnt replacing : newurl.replace(/&search_sortby=price|date|relevance/,'');
[00:23:58] <trickz> coldhead: ok ,thanks!
[00:23:59] <coldhead> people do that all the time
[00:24:04] <trickz> great!
[00:24:22] <gnarf> fandio: give the inputs names, put them in a containing element
[00:24:39] <coldhead> trickz: if you could be bothered reading the source to jQuery you'll see some interesting tricks they do with that
[00:24:45] <coldhead> it's interesting
[00:24:47] <fandio> gnarf: how do you expect the server-side to handle that?
[00:24:51] <coldhead> if you're a massive nerd who reads source code
[00:24:54] <coldhead> sup Tophen
[00:24:55] <gnarf> make a hidden "empty" one as well that you can .clone()
[00:24:58] <Tophen> nothin muvh
[00:25:02] <zilly> How do you get inputs of a certain type?
[00:25:04] <coldhead> much*
[00:25:07] <gnarf> fandio: what does it matter, you aren't going to be submitting the form right?
[00:25:08] <fandio> gnarf: oh interesting
[00:25:19] <fandio> gnarf: sure I would. why wouldn't I?
[00:25:27] <gnarf> i thought you weren't
[00:25:30] <trickz> ok
[00:25:37] <fandio> ah no. the Ajax stuff is all bullshit
[00:25:44] <gnarf> okay
[00:25:44] <gnarf> then
[00:25:49] <Tophen> close enough
[00:25:54] <gnarf> make your inputs named like item[1][name]
[00:25:59] <gnarf> and item[1][description]
[00:25:59] <fandio> so yeah, I basically just have the server side read that hidden element,
[00:26:00] <gnarf> etc
[00:26:16] <fandio> and then it'll know how many items to expect looping over?
[00:26:32] <gnarf> can django handle that form of input naming?
[00:26:38] <fandio> gnarf: I don't understand that syntax
[00:26:43] <fandio> gnarf: not nicely, no.
[00:26:51] <gnarf> if you do that in php, youll have $_POST["item"] as an array
[00:26:58] <gnarf> that you can foreach
[00:27:17] <fandio> well i'm sure django can do that -- just not with Django forms
[00:27:22] <fandio> which are total crap anyhow
[00:27:29] <anli_> Is there an event that occurs after a datepicker is shown?
[00:27:38] <anli_> I want to modify it and create a month picker
[00:27:43] <fandio> gnarf: okay and suppose someone deletes an item?
[00:28:05] <fandio> gnarf: so they remove element 7. the server-side is expecting that element to be there
[00:28:20] <gnarf> then because there isn't an element 7, you know there isn't an element 7
[00:28:27] <gnarf> or it was removed
[00:28:48] <fandio> hmm alrihgt
[00:28:48] <Rinthe> I made a lightbox viewer for my website with jQuery
[00:29:06] <anli_> I would add or delete elements, and when you want to save the list of elements on the server side, you recreate the whole list
[00:29:08] <Rinthe> but i'm having the weirdest problem, it works on some images, but not with others. can someone help me see what's up?
[00:29:21] <anli_> starting with deleting the previous elements
[00:29:24] <fandio> gnarf: so effectively you're making the frontend much simpler and making the form processing happen server-side instead of fucking around with fake ajax and JSON?
[00:29:44] <anli_> what is fake ajax? :)
[00:29:48] <gnarf> fandio: sounds easiest, and least prone to error
[00:29:52] <fandio> ajax misused
[00:29:56] <anli_> aha
[00:30:05] <zilly> How do you select only input elements with type text?
[00:30:08] <anli_> I use it for everything so probably I am misusing it as well then
[00:30:17] <anli_> $(':text');
[00:30:23] <Rinthe> someone?
[00:30:23] <gnarf> fandio: then when you clone a new row, you can just update the "numeric" part of the fields
[00:30:28] <fandio> i have zero reason to use ajax here, yet I did because I'm a shitty web developer.
[00:30:32] <Rinthe> let me know if u can help so i can pm you a link
[00:30:39] <fandio> gnarf: clone?
[00:30:53] <anli_> If you see the <form> tag anywhere, the idea of using ajax instead should be in your mind
[00:31:02] <anli_> Lets face it, form tags are not that beautiful
[00:31:21] <anli_> And reloading posted to webpages is an annoyance
[00:32:19] <coldhead> nothing in html is very beautiful
[00:32:26] <fandio> gnarf: oh .clone().
[00:32:47] <fandio> gnarf: well that sounds good then. One last question I suppose. How do I keep track of the number that i"m up to?
[00:33:06] <fandio> i.e what the current "numeric part" of the fields should be?
[00:34:08] <Rinthe> I made a lightbox viewer for my website with jQuery. but i'm having the weirdest problem, it works on some images, but not with others. can someone help me see what's up? let me know if you can so i can pm you a link
[00:34:18] <anli_> coldhead: exactly, so making it js instead is better :)
[00:35:34] <coldhead> ?eval var counter = (function () {var i = 0; return function () {return i++;};})(); counter() + ', ' + counter() + ', ' + counter();
[00:35:34] <bot-t> coldhead: "0, 1, 2"
[00:37:23] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/ecgXV/
[00:37:23] <anli_> I am using beforeShow in my datepicker and try to add a class to the popup, is that possible?
[00:37:30] <gnarf> fandio:
[00:37:41] <gnarf> fandio: tbh you could even do something like this:
[00:39:39] <gnarf> fandio: http://jsfiddle.net/ecgXV/1/ added some code to the form submit to make sure all of the ids are in numeric order
[00:40:03] <coldhead> that's sexy, gnarf
[00:40:56] <fandio> that's fucking ELEGANT
[00:41:20] <fandio> that's about as close to what I was came here looking for as I could possibly hope to find
[00:41:32] <fandio> (not that coldhead's help wasn't valuable as well)
[00:41:34] <amit_usual> i am sharing context from python with jquery the problem is the integers are long and javascript does not support long integers
[00:41:46] <coldhead> gnarf is one of the immortal gods
[00:41:51] <gnarf> lol coldhead
[00:41:51] <amit_usual> any idea how i can handle that
[00:41:52] <anli_> :)
[00:41:56] <eighty4> http://jsfiddle.net/RPP5G/ <-- clicking on both divs will give you an alert('bar'). What's the best way to instead of bar get the config.foo value you set? Using $.data() or something else?
[00:42:24] <fandio> gnarf: one thing -- what's with preventDefault? </jsnoob>
[00:42:37] <coldhead> ?preventdefault
[00:42:37] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:43:06] <fandio> yeah I read the docs on it
[00:43:13] <fandio> i just don't see why it's needed contextually
[00:43:32] <fandio> the hell default action does a button have?
[00:43:48] <gnarf> fandio: now with remove button http://jsfiddle.net/4AaY7/
[00:43:51] <DarsVaeda> click probably?
[00:43:55] <gnarf> fandio: within a form - submission
[00:44:10] <gnarf> remove it and see
[00:44:10] <fandio> gnarf: ah
[00:44:12] * gnarf grins
[00:44:12] <courpse> fandio, <button>'s default type is submit, :/
[00:44:21] <fandio> courpse: oh I didn't know that
[00:44:45] <courpse> type="button" is needed, and odd.
[00:45:05] <gnarf> fandio: now updates ID's on submit and click: http://jsfiddle.net/4AaY7/1/
[00:45:14] <gnarf> for the remove
[00:45:15] <gnarf> that is
[00:45:37] <gnarf> note the use of delegate to apply to all remove buttons even ones that aren't created yet
[00:45:39] <gnarf> ?delegate
[00:45:39] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:45:46] <courpse> A $.get is synchronous?
[00:46:02] <gnarf> courpse: not unless you async: false
[00:46:12] <courpse> Humm, odd.
[00:46:19] <gnarf> but it returns a deferred immediately
[00:46:39] <courpse> I wrote a shoutbox that gets json via $.get.
[00:46:59] <courpse> That part works fine, but its like it doesnt find my element sometimes that i'm .appending too.
[00:47:06] <courpse> .preprending*
[00:47:54] <DarsVaeda> do you ensure that the element exist already?
[00:47:59] <fandio> gnarf: wouldn't .live() also have worked in place of the delegate?
[00:48:16] <gnarf> fandio: yes, .live === delegate on the window
[00:48:18] <courpse> i can do a console.log(msg); after my $('#messages').prepend() line, and it shows every line.
[00:48:24] <fandio> gnarf: and why is it better to update the ids on every change rather than in one big operation right before submission?
[00:48:35] <courpse> DarsVaeda, Well, i'm unsure why i'd have to if its default async.
[00:48:45] <gnarf> fandio: *shrug*
[00:48:54] <gnarf> fandio: might be pointless to do
[00:49:09] <fandio> gnarf: yeah, just curious.
[00:49:11] <gnarf> i figured the remove button should prolly update ids tho
[00:49:43] <gnarf> yer right - it prolly isn't needed
[00:49:57] <gnarf> in which case, might as well make the template item[0]
[00:49:58] <heshanh> if i resize the widht of a div usinganimate is there a way to capture the change event so i can update a another div
[00:50:05] <gnarf> and just update right b4 submit
[00:50:05] <heshanh> using animate
[00:51:11] <courpse> I trigger getmessages(); last on the page, yet it still doesn't find the #messages id?
[00:51:38] <gnarf> heshanh: change event?
[00:51:43] <fandio> gnarf: well I must say that's some of the coolest jQuery code i've seen in a long time
[00:51:56] <fandio> the asterisk thing is fucking brilliant
[00:52:01] <gnarf> fandio: jQuery is a lot easier than it looks when you're new :)
[00:52:09] <fandio> gnarf: that's for damn sure
[00:52:21] <coldhead> it's like sex
[00:52:26] <gnarf> fandio: don't worry, my jQueries looked a lot like yours 2 yrs ago
[00:52:27] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[00:52:32] <DarsVaeda> did you ever have sex?
[00:52:33] <courpse> lol
[00:52:36] <gnarf> ?twss @coldhead
[00:52:37] <bot-t> coldhead, <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[00:52:37] <DarsVaeda> oh sorry wrong window too
[00:52:57] <heshanh> guys is there a way to capture a width change on a div?
[00:53:00] <coldhead> two years ago my sex looked a lot like jQuery libraries
[00:53:04] <coldhead> and today nothing has changed
[00:53:09] <fandio> gnarf: here i've only been _programming_ for little over a year
[00:53:11] <coldhead> it's a medical condition!
[00:53:22] <fandio> (and only web development for a few months)
[00:53:38] <coldhead> heshanh: there's no 'resize' event you can bind to
[00:53:48] <gnarf> fandio: I was programming before JS was even a language
[00:53:49] <gnarf> :)
[00:54:01] <gnarf> fandio: found a "bug"
[00:54:02] <coldhead> heshanh: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[00:54:14] <fandio> gnarf: heh
[00:54:28] <fandio> gnarf: wait you found a bug in the jsfiddle?
[00:54:43] <zilly> Can you not bind focus to submit inputs?  It's not working for me.
[00:54:46] <gnarf> fandio: http://jsfiddle.net/4AaY7/2/
[00:54:54] <gnarf> fandio: yeah, it wasn't removing the "template" class
[00:54:55] <heshanh> thaks cold ill give that atry :)
[00:54:56] <gnarf> figured it should
[00:56:04] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[00:56:09] <coldhead> and i can see my own spine
[00:56:45] <fandio> gnarf: ah. what's up with the .hide()?
[00:56:54] <gnarf> fandio: so it can be .slideDown()
[00:57:03] <gnarf> just to make it look cooler
[00:57:04] <gnarf> :)
[00:57:13] <coldhead> aww
[00:57:31] <gnarf> you can remove the .hide() and the slideDown()
[00:57:49] <rahmen> Hi! I've got a script where I update the source of the image in a fancybox. Sometimes the source has a different size. So I thought I could just look for it and then animate fancybox's dimensions. Is there a way to do this easily? I can't get the source image dimensions and therefor I don't know when to resize.
[01:01:54] <fandio> gnarf: uh maybe i'm missing something but I don't see how calling .hide() on the template div causes the sliddown effect to worj
[01:01:56] <fandio> work*
[01:02:17] <gnarf> fandio: calling slideDown() on something already shown does nothing
[01:02:28] <fandio> OH
[01:02:30] <gnarf> it worked before without the .hide() cuz the "template" class made it hidden
[01:04:47] <fandio> gnarf: good thing I didn't ask you any more questions about that
[01:04:58] <fandio> i finally realized the css block on the side was throwing me off :)
[01:05:07] <fandio> sometimes it pays to actually look at things
[01:05:54] <fandio> gnarf: anyhow, thanks very much for the help & example. It's 4AM over here, so i'm not about to dive into my codebase right now, but i'll be sure to do that first thing tomorrow morning :)
[01:06:06] <gnarf> fandio: np
[01:06:08] <gnarf> ?glwt
[01:06:08] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[01:07:16] <Rinthe> is there a way to display tags with # infront of it for each post?
[01:07:33] <Rinthe> # included in the link
[01:10:50] <anli_> gnarf: Here is how I would solve fandios problem: http://jsfiddle.net/4U4Gr/1/
[01:11:04] <anli_> But it doesnt run well in jsfiddle
[01:11:29] <anli_> hm, but http://jsfiddle.net/4U4Gr/2/ does
[01:11:42] <gnarf> anli_: already fails my quick check
[01:11:48] <gnarf> onclick? really? :)
[01:11:55] <gnarf> boooo
[01:12:19] <chealey> Hey guys, i'm not too hot with query but have a need some help. I need a link (when clicked) to pass a string to a hidden field (set that fields value with it) and then also (click the submit button) on the form. to process
[01:12:32] <anli_> gnarf: whats wrong with onclick?
[01:12:38] <gnarf> ?inline
[01:12:38] <bot-t> don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[01:12:48] <anli_> I did not need to debug it
[01:12:49] <DarsVaeda> I wonder why jsfiddle seperates html and css and javascript...I bet because you should paste everything in HTML...
[01:12:53] <anli_> Or reuse it
[01:12:58] <gnarf> anli_: yet...
[01:13:15] <anli_> sacrificing code readability for the future cant be good
[01:13:26] <gnarf> anli_: and really, is $("#someid").click( add_clicked ) really that hard?
[01:13:44] <gnarf> anli_: its way more readable if all the events / binding are in one place
[01:13:47] <anli_> gnarf: yes, it makes the code harder to read
[01:14:07] <gnarf> anli_: not spread throughout the html
[01:14:32] <gnarf> anli_: if you use jQuery and use onclick, you're doing it wrong....
[01:14:47] <anli_> centralizing functionality to one place is often seens as better, but I disagree
[01:14:51] <anli_> seems
[01:15:01] <gnarf> anli_: well, every other "expert" here agrees with me
[01:15:06] <anli_> Its wrong to say that a method that works is wrong
[01:15:13] <chealey> gnarl think u can give me a quick hand on something man? I'd greatly appreciate it. :)
[01:15:14] <gnarf> anli_:  it doesn't work tho
[01:15:21] <anli_> Oh, then you are probably right
[01:15:23] <anli_> Sorry
[01:15:24] <chealey> gnarf*
[01:15:27] <gnarf> anli_: where is the event preventDefault
[01:15:32] <anli_> There is no form
[01:15:36] <coldhead> $('a').attr('onClick', "javascript:void alert('lol')");
[01:15:53] <anli_> What do you want to prevent then?
[01:16:17] <anli_> It would be interesting to hear expert compare our pieces of code
[01:16:20] <gnarf> anli_: either way, using onclick in your html = FAIL
[01:16:26] <anli_> I hear you
[01:16:34] <chealey> that's awesome, now can one of u help me? lol
[01:16:44] <gnarf> ?ask
[01:16:45] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:16:48] <medvind> hello! I have two timing functions - one countdown() and one setInterval() -  that work fine separately, but when run together, the setInterval function gets irregular. Please help me! Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/b6y2CN4w
[01:16:56] <chealey> I asked above
[01:17:08] <gnarf> chealey: then repeat maybe?
[01:17:19] <chealey> Essentially i have a link that on click needs to pass a string to a hidden field as well as click the submit button to process the form.
[01:17:20] <gnarf> chealey: if you haven't gotten an answer yet its prolly cuz noone read it
[01:17:31] <chealey> Sorry man i don't mean to sound sassy, just really need help.
[01:17:37] <chealey> My apologies if i came off that way
[01:17:58] <gnarf> chealey: so, bind a click handler to the link, find the input and set its .val() and then call .submit() on the form
[01:18:09] <gnarf> perhaps prevent the default on the <a> click
[01:18:21] <chealey> could you elaborate a bit more? Jquery and javascript are not my thing, i just need it for this particular functionality.
[01:18:57] <chealey> You could say i'm an uber newb here (although my bookshelf is full of js and jq books)
[01:19:14] <anli_> Why do they write jquery books? :)
[01:19:31] <smurfke> popular thus easy to sell
[01:19:40] <anli_> hm, well, ok
[01:19:42] <chealey> truth^
[01:20:17] <gnarf> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/
[01:20:45] <gnarf> of course "input" is prolly a really cheap example, you should use an id if it has one
[01:20:52] <chealey> right ok
[01:20:57] <chealey> now here is where it may get a bit complicated
[01:21:05] <chealey> this link that changes that passes the value
[01:21:14] <gnarf> in the href?
[01:21:20] <chealey> correct
[01:21:45] <gnarf> how?
[01:21:48] <chealey> there can be an infinite number of these links on a page (that all pass different values) however only one can be processed at a time clearly as i need when one is clicked for the "submit" button to also have been simulated clicked.
[01:22:05] <chealey> Does that make sense?
[01:23:01] <chealey> So clearly i would have to use a class rather than an ID to prevent conflicts, but my concern then is, if all the links have the same class, would it not try and pass the values of all the links or would it still only pass the value of the one that was clicked?
[01:23:44] <gnarf> chealey: how is the value stored in the link
[01:24:09] <chealey> that's flexible, i have full control over how it's stored.
[01:24:34] <anli_> If you make that less flexible, you have better control :)
[01:24:47] <gnarf> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/1/
[01:24:52] <chealey> Should i give you a more "big picture" view of the problem to possibly understand more clearly?
[01:24:57] <natrixnatrix89> what does this classid mean on swf files? classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
[01:25:01] <medvind> (never mind my question, I might have it figured out)
[01:25:49] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/2/
[01:25:52] <anli_> gnarf: wouldnt returning false do the same as preventDefault here?
[01:25:53] <gnarf> sry chealey ^^^
[01:26:02] <gnarf> anli_: yes, and more things that aren't needed
[01:26:06] <gnarf> like stopPropagation
[01:26:10] <gnarf> and stopImmediatePropagation
[01:26:13] <anli_> haha
[01:26:24] <anli_> return false is all needed here, I assume
[01:26:33] <chealey> Ok so should i give you a more big picture real quick to make sure that this would do the trick?
[01:26:34] <anli_> So the browser will not try navigating
[01:26:54] <gnarf> chealey: why wouldn't it?
[01:27:09] <gnarf> anli_: preventDefault() does that?
[01:27:12] <chealey> I haven't a clue, my javascript and jquery is mediocor at best.
[01:27:29] <chealey> Just figured i'd check :)
[01:27:37] <Viliasas> Hello, i'm using jQuery UI Dialog component to show custom html tables in dialogs. Everything works fine in all browsers, except Internet Explorer 9. Might someone know why IE doesn't show my images in dialog?
[01:27:42] <anli_> gnarf: yes, I know, but what about return false?
[01:27:46] <chealey> Let me give this a shot, might have another quick question.
[01:27:51] <gnarf> anli_: does more things than just preventDefault()
[01:28:00] <anli_> But not bad things, right?
[01:28:15] <anli_> And you dont need to use the event object
[01:28:38] <gnarf> anli_: in this tiny tiny example - and probably in his case, the additional things from a return false will probably not cause any problems
[01:28:39] <gnarf> however
[01:29:05] <gnarf> i still feel its better to only preventDefault() and the "click" event will then still propagate to outer elements too
[01:29:12] <anli_> I like how regexp is used instead of jquery here :)
[01:29:29] <chealey> Gnarf, i may need a bit more help, going to paste the html that i have output (the field that will be hidden) into the jsfiddle and see if u can give me guidance. one sec.
[01:30:17] <gnarf> anli_: no builtin function to parse query strings
[01:30:32] <gnarf> if it were more complicated, i'd suggest using BBQ's deparam
[01:30:34] <anli_> But here, we only have to use .val()
[01:30:49] <gnarf> .val() isn't "valid" on an <a>
[01:30:49] <anli_> I am probably not following you now
[01:30:57] <anli_> eh, sorry, .attr('href')
[01:30:58] <anli_> doh
[01:31:11] <gnarf> why bother with .attr('href') instead of just this.href?
[01:31:17] <gnarf> $(this).attr('href')
[01:31:22] <anli_> Hm, I am jquery damanged probably
[01:31:25] <anli_> you are right
[01:31:37] <gnarf> thats like 2 extra function calls
[01:31:47] <gnarf> totally unnessecary
[01:31:50] <anli_> yes
[01:33:41] <xec> anli_: gnarf is always right
[01:33:48] <anli_> I want to add a class to the popup of a datepicker without changing the code for datepicker, suggestions?
[01:34:06] <anli_> xec: Not when it comes to estimating the value of using <form> on a webpage
[01:34:07] <gnarf> xec: untrue
[01:34:16] <xec> i'm not listening
[01:34:20] <anli_> gnarf: ++
[01:34:21] <xec> *fingers in ears*
[01:34:24] <anli_> hehe
[01:35:44] <chealey> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/3/
[01:35:57] <chealey> That's the html that is output (for the form element that needs to have the values applied to it
[01:36:11] <gnarf> anli_: .datepicker("widget").addClass("classname")
[01:37:22] <anli_> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/4/
[01:37:25] <anli_> gnarf: must try that
[01:38:07] <chealey> anli_: that doesn't address the need for it to click the submit button though?
[01:38:24] <anli_> chealey: Oh, remove those ids for the <a>:s
[01:38:34] <chealey> yeah multiple id's never made sense
[01:38:37] <anli_> Ah, you also want to submit
[01:38:47] <anli_> And those links do not need to be identified
[01:38:51] <anli_> So they dont need ids
[01:39:03] <chealey> right
[01:39:41] <gnarf> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/7/
[01:40:06] <gnarf> chealey: you can use the id of the parent element as the value too
[01:40:37] <anli_> chealey: <a href="blah">click me</a>
[01:40:37] <anli_> <a href="blah2">or me</a>
[01:40:37] <anli_> <form method="post" action="foobar.php">
[01:40:37] <anli_>     <input name="var" value="to update me">
[01:40:37] <anli_> </form>
[01:40:40] <anli_> oops
[01:40:42] <anli_> sorry!
[01:40:52] <anli_> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/QAQaT/10/
[01:41:42] <chealey> Ok now anli_ and gnarl the 2 things you're showing me look to be quite different, what is the difference between the two? Why should i use one over the other?
[01:41:53] <anli_> use gnarfs
[01:41:57] <anli_> Time to work
[01:42:03] <chealey> lol?
[01:42:10] <gnarf> chealey: they aren't that different
[01:42:18] <chealey> ok
[01:42:25] <chealey> now in the html that i input
[01:42:39] <gnarf> did you see what i did with the handler in the new paste?
[01:42:51] <gnarf> i used $(this).closest('li').attr('id') to get the "option" string
[01:43:23] <gnarf> tbh - you could prolly make the li itself the thing that changed the value
[01:44:26] <gnarf> rather than the <a> but it doesn't make much of a difference
[01:44:30] <chealey> It appears that there is already a hidden input field (that's a drop down that lets a selection be made) could i not just set the values to auto update THAT hidden field?
[01:44:39] <chealey> correct me if i'm wrong please, just trying to think here.
[01:45:39] <gnarf> chealey: huh?
[01:45:51] <gnarf> chealey: why aren't you using a <select> ?
[01:46:22] <chealey> this is auto generated
[01:46:25] <chealey> I don't have the ability
[01:46:33] <gnarf> thats some REALLLLLY shitty html
[01:46:37] <chealey> the code i have that outputs that html is just {field:my field}
[01:46:40] <chealey> yeah i agree
[01:47:00] <gnarf> fix it
[01:47:04] <gnarf> make it use a <select> :)
[01:47:09] <gnarf> then you wont need to write any JS
[01:47:11] <gnarf> and it will work
[01:47:12] <chealey> but me doing {field:my field} outputs that i can't fix it, it's auto generated.
[01:47:20] <chealey> that's why i need the js
[01:47:25] <gnarf> so, write your own select
[01:47:33] <chealey> to basically manipulate what i "shouldn't" be able to manipulate
[01:47:47] <chealey> I can't this is tied into a cms, have to use what is being output
[01:48:02] <gnarf> which cms?
[01:48:06] <chealey> the database tables this data relates to are fairly advanced, this is just the shit end of it :P
[01:48:26] <chealey> ExpressionEngine but that crap is output by the add-on Playa 4.x
[01:48:32] <gnarf> if they were advanced, they'd have a way to query what you want
[01:48:39] <gnarf> and make a select
[01:48:42] <chealey> they do, but this is utilizing an addon
[01:48:51] <gnarf> which is shitty?
[01:48:54] <chealey> (it's a relationship query essentially)
[01:48:57] <chealey> the add-on is actually great
[01:49:04] <chealey> just not here
[01:49:09] <Hory> Why does   setTimeout(function() { $li.remove(); }, 1000);   work but   setTimeout($.proxy($li.remove, $li), 1000); sometimes work sometimes throw an error? ("q.replace is not a function")
[01:49:33] <rahmen> I want to stream images with fancybox. I update the src and get the stream. But sometimes the image has a new dimension. So I'd like fancybox to resize to fit the image. How can I achieve this?
[01:49:39] <gnarf> chealey: okay well, ignoring the retarted html
[01:50:03] <gnarf> chealey: $("li").click() and setting the val of your hidden to the id of the li work?
[01:50:38] <chealey> I think that should work
[01:50:49] <chealey> could you write it out for me so i can give it a shot?
[01:52:50] <gnarf> chealey: how about you try, and if it doesn't work you ask someone to help you figure out why
[01:55:14] <gnarf> chealey: might be able to like var hidden = $("#findMyHidden"); $("li").click(function() { hidden.val( $(this).find("input").val() ); });
[01:55:15] <chealey> :(
[01:55:39] <gnarf> since it has that input inside it
[01:56:03] <chealey> hmm ok i'll give it a shot and see what i can do, this shit is all greek to me though.
[01:56:15] <chealey> This one thing is holding up the development of this entire site it's such a bitch
[01:56:23] <chealey> thanks for your help man
[01:56:26] <chealey> really appreciate it
[01:58:35] <Viliasas> Hello, might someone know why IE doesn't show images in tables, which are shown in jQuery UI Dialog component?
[01:58:50] <chealey> IE… lol
[01:59:22] <anli_> gnarf: hm, I dont know where to add that class to the datepicker...
[01:59:29] <anli_> In beforeShow maybe?
[01:59:59] <gnarf> anli_: you only want it on one datepicker? cuz I'm unsure if datepicker resues its widget or not
[02:00:09] <gnarf> you can do it right after you created it
[02:00:29] <gnarf> elem.datepicker(); elem.datepicker("widget").addClass("tested")
[02:00:37] <anli_> cool
[02:00:57] <anli_> beforeShow also worked, I can see now
[02:01:00] <anli_> Wonder whats best
[02:01:09] <anli_> Probably on creation
[02:02:14] <anli_> .datepicker("widget") is giving me access to some kind of template?
[02:02:21] <chealey> hey gnarf: the code mentioning $("form".submit();    how do i make sure that it's submitting the correct form? Do i need to identify it in some way or place this code within the form or what?
[02:02:22] <gnarf> its the datepicker widget
[02:02:34] <anli_> Thats a truth, yes
[02:02:43] <anli_> Everyone can validate it
[02:02:46] <gnarf> chealey: select it with an id / class
[02:02:56] <chealey> not following?
[02:03:07] <gnarf> give the form an id or a class and select it
[02:03:12] <gnarf> its a css selector
[02:03:18] <chealey> right
[02:03:22] <gnarf> or even
[02:03:27] <gnarf> hidden.closest('form')
[02:03:28] <chealey> so i would just change form to #myform ?
[02:03:32] <gnarf> to get the form that contains the hiden
[02:03:56] <chealey> all forms have hidden shit (and this page actually has only 1 form i just want to make sure i don't cause some complications down the line)
[02:03:59] <gnarf> but $("#myform") might be faster than hidden.closest("form")
[02:04:17] <chealey> ok adding an ID shouldn't be difficult
[02:04:40] <gnarf> anli_: almost all the UI widgets will return the actual widget for that function
[02:04:56] <gnarf> anli_: what did you mean "some sort of template"?
[02:05:31] <courpse> $('.extra').ready(function() { $(this).removeClass('extra'); }); is valid?
[02:06:06] <gnarf> courpse the "ready" event doesn't make any sense on anything other than document
[02:06:13] <courpse> Balls.
[02:06:26] <anli_> gnarf: Ah, must think here, is the popup for the datepicker reused all the time?
[02:06:42] <gnarf> anli_: thats what I said right after i suggested that course
[02:06:55] <gnarf> gnarf: anli_: you only want it on one datepicker? cuz I'm unsure if datepicker resues its widget or not
[02:07:35] <anli_> Ah, must check then, I am doing a monthpicker which actually hides some datepicker elements
[02:07:53] <anli_> I know its ugly, but then I dont have to write a new
[02:08:02] <anli_> Saving time
[02:08:04] <gnarf> if it reuses its widget, you might wanna add the class to beforeShow and a close or whatever
[02:08:18] <anli_> yeah, it did
[02:08:28] <anli_> So I have to catch beforeShow for normal datepickers
[02:08:31] <anli_> And removeClass
[02:08:32] <courpse> gnarf, I have images inside a div with class extra, how can i check if those images are loaded?
[02:08:32] <gnarf> no
[02:08:40] <courpse> gnarf, Would i need onload inline JS?
[02:08:41] <gnarf> just catch the closing of the special one
[02:08:55] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[02:08:56] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() jquery plugin  Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[02:08:56] <anli_> I cant see a real difference
[02:09:08] <anli_> Maybe its a good thing to do
[02:09:14] <gnarf> anli_: exept your suggestion requires all datepickers know about this special class
[02:09:23] <anli_> true
[02:09:24] <gnarf> where mine requires the only special one knowing it
[02:09:25] <anli_> you are right
[02:09:35] <anli_> doing it in the close handler is more clean
[02:09:44] <anli_> although its dirty altogether :)
[02:11:10] <Brammm> Hi guys. Question: I'm doing an ajax request that returns a bunch of html which is then displayed in a dialog (using jquery ui). This html however can contain upto a few hundred (even 2000) checkboxes. Displaying them works, but the browser tends to freeze a second. Is this due to the amound of elements? Or simly the size of the return?
[02:11:17] <Brammm> How would I best go about optimizing this?
[02:11:46] <dr0id> I think amount of elements
[02:11:52] <arpu> hello how can i fin dout (jquerymobile) if browser is not on an mobile device
[02:12:08] <anli_> gnarf: yeah, that worked with a charm, now I only need to check why the picked month is not always updated in the edit box
[02:12:31] <anli_> Maybe I should create a yearpicker as well :)
[02:13:02] <[E]sc> is there a way to select span of a specific class? what would the notation be if its possible?
[02:13:41] <anli_> span.theclass
[02:14:04] <[E]sc> thanks anli_
[02:16:40] <mazzachre> I have seen a construct sometimes in html like <script type="text/javascript" src="script/myscript.js">{option1: "something"}</script> How does that work? How can I use the option object included there in my scripts?
[02:18:44] <chealey> can i target a form element by name rather than class or id ?
[02:20:27] <gnarf> mazzachre: i've never seen that and don't believe it does anything
[02:20:49] <gnarf> ?attribute equals selector @chealey
[02:20:50] <bot-t> chealey, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[02:21:13] <chealey> thanks gnarf
[02:21:22] <dr0id> where's the fun ?
[02:21:27] <mazzachre> gnarf: Well,. google uses it, it sets language for some of their scripts that do internationalization... So it works, but I have not idea how to make it work, because the content is just ignored by normal parsing...
[02:22:12] <chealey> so gnarl with that ugly html block could i not target the input with the name of the hidden field?
[02:22:35] <yarco> hi, all. one question
[02:22:44] <dr0id> only 1? really?
[02:22:50] <chealey> so instead of "input" set it as "[name='reserved-vehicle[selection][]']"
[02:22:58] <chealey> ?
[02:23:13] <yarco> if i <script type="text/javascript" src="test.js?data=abc"></script>   , can i get data=abc in test.js?
[02:23:44] <yarco> dr0id: YES!
[02:24:27] <DarsVaeda> dr0id: you are in too many channels :P
[02:24:41] <dr0id> ami?
[02:25:14] <dr0id> yarco: well, I haven't tried but maybe try $('script[data-lol="abc"]')
[02:25:26] <dr0id> ohh wait, sorry
[02:25:30] <DarsVaeda> I will get confused and ask php here and jquery there...
[02:25:34] <dr0id> your tag was cut by my client
[02:27:04] <yarco> i'm in 5 channels ! yeah! but i want js to get the variable.
[02:27:06] <gnarf> chealey: still prolly want the "input[name=...]"
[02:27:22] <chealey> ok but all those brackets aren't going to fuck shit up?
[02:27:32] <mazzachre> Is there a nice way in jquery to get the tag that included this script?
[02:27:44] <dr0id> yarco: what are you trying to achieve ?
[02:28:09] <chealey> so $("input[name='reserved-vehicle[selections][]']").val(this.href); should work yes?
[02:28:16] <yarco> dr0id: i want to pass some values to external js
[02:28:27] <gnarf> chealey: yeah, but there are more than that one input with that name right?
[02:28:31] <gnarf> cuz that will set all of them
[02:28:39] <chealey> nope just that one
[02:28:43] <dr0id> passing it from server side code is one way, using hashtags are another
[02:28:55] <gnarf> yarco: the js itself wouldnt know about data=abc
[02:29:09] <dr0id> not very much sure about getting the GET values, wait and watch for others to answer
[02:29:40] <yarco> but we could get it in the same page like : window.location..  http://ilovethecode.com/Javascript/Javascript-Tutorials-How_To-Easy/Get_Query_String_Using_Javascript.shtml
[02:29:42] <[E]sc> i have a jquery, which i'm using to flip the ^ 180, but it's causing all the spans to do that, is there a way around that? http://jsfiddle.net/JSZBc/
[02:30:07] <gnarf> yarco: you could set a set a global before you include the file and reference the global in the file
[02:30:43] <StPiere> i found an strange issue with simplemodal plugin : onShow callback should be called after the modal window opens, but in fact its called when the modal window dom tree is created and BEFORE modal window opens...anyone found workaround?
[02:31:16] <gnarf> <script>myscriptdata= "lol";</script><script src="blah.js"></script> then in blah.js, if myscriptdata is there its there
[02:33:25] <yarco> gnarf: they should make it accept using query string in external js…why not merge two <script> into one <script src="blah.js?myscriptdata=lol"></script>?
[02:34:21] <gnarf> yarco: cuz 9 times out of 10 you wont need either...
[02:36:10] <gnarf> the server can parse the myscriptdata on the request
[02:36:21] <gnarf> but the file served doesn't know what url it came from
[02:36:37] <mazzachre> Is there any way to get the element that included the script currently running in jquery? Sort of like <script type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js"></script> I want that script tag from within the myscript ?
[02:37:04] <gnarf> mazzachre: not reliably cross browser afaik
[02:37:07] <mazzachre> Or must I include an ID in the script tag and fetch it?
[02:37:56] <dexter_e> if you have id you can get it
[02:38:23] <kitikonti> whats wrong here http://pastebin.com/XmXRqpg3
[02:41:18] <WholemealLoaf> nothing wrong with that so long as you have an 'alter' function?
[02:41:52] <kitikonti> WholemealLoaf : :-) yeah i have found the failure
[02:42:02] <WholemealLoaf> :)
[02:47:02] <medvind> Hello. I have a problem with conflicting jquery timers. I use Tom Ellis' jCountdown plugin to display a H:M:S countdown - this script uses setInterval. The other timer is in an image rotator script - i have tried it with both setInterval and setTimeout, but whichever I use, the rotator goes nuts after a while (it loses its interval setting and starts looping quickly) - but only when the countdown script is present. How
[02:47:02] <medvind>  could I resolve the conflict?
[02:50:50] <Creap> Hi. I document.createElement a bunch of element and then want to add an event to all of them with jQuery, is there a better way than $(el1).add(el2).add(el3).event() ?
[02:51:50] <anli_> Creap: You can also create elements with  $('<div><span/></div>'); etc
[02:51:50] <Cork> Creap: create the element in jquery
[02:52:12] <anli_> var div = $('<div><span/></div>'); $('#parent_div').append(div);
[02:53:28] <Creap> does that change anything? I also add a bunch of attributes
[02:53:44] <WholemealLoaf> or if you want to be chainier use appendTo and then you can chain the event right on the end: $('<div><span/></div>').appendTo('#parent').event()
[02:53:53] <Creap> I know it's not really different, but I find it ugly to have HTML in my JavaScript :P
[02:54:17] <WholemealLoaf> get used to it, debugging a bunch of createElements is much worse IMO :)
[03:00:48] <WholemealLoaf> Creap, you can also obv do various things to keep those html strings out of your main functional code. store them in variables, in object literals or modules, load them from external files, use templating languages etc.
[03:01:19] <WholemealLoaf> though watching the latest jsconf videos I'm feeling tempted to rip out all templating from my current app, damn you jsconf :)
[03:01:50] <Creap> I'm using Node.js on the server side with Embedded JS templates so it would make sense to use that on the client side as well
[03:02:14] <WholemealLoaf> ah yeah that could work
[03:04:13] <trickz> hello
[03:04:30] <trickz> $('select').live('change', function(){}); will call the change event once on page load ?
[03:04:40] <trickz> it seems to happen so and this is not good
[03:05:35] <WholemealLoaf> nope that shouldn't happen. is it because you're injecting some options into the select on page load?
[03:06:03] <WholemealLoaf> not that that should do it either...
[03:06:10] <trickz> nope, injecting nothing
[03:06:29] <trickz> hmm, maybe some other part of my code is triggering the change event
[03:08:18] <harshada> hey m using ajaxFileUpload plugin, when i put a breakpoint client side then its going server side properly, otherwise its just refreshing the page..
[03:09:00] <WholemealLoaf> is jsfiddle crazy slow for anyone else?
[03:09:24] <harshada> to make sync call, i put async:false, and return false too, but still its not working properly
[03:11:14] <WholemealLoaf> harshada, what do you mean by not working properly?
[03:11:56] <Aamir> trickz:  http://jsfiddle.net/XrAet/
[03:12:05] <harshada> WholemealLoaf: as i said in prev line its just refreshing the page, not going to url specified in ajaxFileUpload
[03:12:13] <WholemealLoaf> oic sry
[03:13:49] <chealey> gnarl are u still here?
[03:19:24] <pgherveou> Hi anyone knows how to detect when a connected draggable drag over a sortable, the over and out events only seems to work from one sortable to another, but not with draggable element
[03:19:26] <nisseni> I have a on screen keyboard plugin, when I load jQuery 1.3.2 the plugin is loaded - however it's not functioning since it requires 1.4+ - loading 1.6.2 the plugin won't even load... what  might be the problem?
[03:20:16] <nisseni> to add to this, I'm loading an earlier version of jquery in the head of the site...
[03:22:30] <gnarf> nisseni: 1.3.2 is way out of date
[03:22:43] <gnarf> and depending on the plugin, 1.6 might be too "new"
[03:23:18] <nisseni> no, since when I'm removing the jquery loaded in the header it works
[03:23:28] <chealey> gnarf: i can't get that form working
[03:23:43] <nisseni> thing is that it's an old system, so I can't just change jquery files
[03:23:56] <chealey> http://jsfiddle.net/Nh2YL/       that is the full html
[03:25:17] <gnarf> nisseni: things get complicated with two jQueries
[03:25:29] <nisseni> gnarf: tell me about it :)
[03:25:41] <gnarf> nisseni: you can make one of them a different function than $
[03:25:45] <nisseni> well, got it working now I hope, just waiting to see the damage on the other scripts I have
[03:25:51] <gnarf> but there is a good chance the "plugin" wont work
[03:25:56] <nisseni> mm
[03:26:02] <gnarf> maybe
[03:26:24] <gnarf> script in the jQuery 1.6.2, script in the plugin, then <script>altQuery = jQuery.noConflict()</script>
[03:26:27] <gnarf> ?noConflict
[03:26:28] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:26:41] <gnarf> you want .noConflict( true ) prolly
[03:26:52] <chealey> gnarf: i pmed you whenever you're done helping him if you could slide back over to my side of the bar that'd be fantastic!
[03:26:55] <gnarf> so it gives "jQuery" back to 1.3
[03:27:24] <gnarf> chealey: honestly, im going back to laying down after this smoke, maybe someone else can help, can't dive into anything huge atm
[03:27:34] <_ramo> Hi there
[03:27:37] <chealey> damn
[03:27:40] <chealey> Anybody want to give me a hand?
[03:27:48] <_ramo> is there a way to display dynamicly generated forms in a modal dialog?
[03:28:10] <jorn> hey, i'm trying to display some strings in a div. my problem is, the strings can include special html chars like <>'"&... there must be an existing function to escape such stuff, just that i can't find it :( anyone?
[03:28:19] <chealey> I guess not?
[03:28:25] <chealey> :(
[03:28:52] <gnarf> ?ask @chealey
[03:28:52] <bot-t> chealey, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:28:58] <gnarf> it helps if people know what they are helping with :)
[03:29:10] <gnarf> ?glwt
[03:29:10] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[03:29:13] <chealey> Yeah, just hard to explain it in depth again
[03:29:53] <chealey> just pmed you again gnarf
[03:30:16] <chealey> no pressure :P
[03:31:33] <medvind> I have two conflicting timers on my page, one with setInterval set to 1 second updating a countdown (with hours, minutes, seconds) and one with setTimeout set to 4 seconds rotating an image reel. The image reel goes nuts after a while, losing its timeout setting. It only happens when the countdown script is present.  Any idea why this happens?
[03:33:05] <jorn> is this the solution? $('<div/>').text('This is fun & stuff').html();
[03:33:34] <chealey> Hey guys i have a list of items (with corresponding links currently with the href set to #) and i also have a form and on that form a drop-down list with options (though not output traditionally). I need when a link is clicked, for it to set the value of the correct input field to be what it should be based on the link that was clicked, and then submit the form (so i can hide the drop down entirely as that's not how i want to output the options). Full html 
[03:33:34] <chealey> can be viewed http://jsfiddle.net/Nh2YL/ however the display doesn't actually show you the full functionality due to everything not being processed on jsfiddle. Could anybody give me a hand with this?
[03:37:48] <aaronmcadam> anyone using sass?
[03:40:35] <fasta> I use the fadein effect, but when a user quickly enters and exits the area for which the effect is defined, the effect is 'too slow'. Is there a solution for that?
[03:40:48] <fasta> So, a sequence of effects is essentially queued up.
[03:41:22] <chealey> stop the effect when they enter another area
[03:41:43] <chealey> that way it doesn't queue anything up because it terminates before starting another fadein/out
[03:42:50] <IrishWilly> hello I was wondering if i could get some advice for designing a modular class in javascript. inheritance in javascript is kinda weirding me out
[03:43:35] <fasta> chealey: that requires a 'handle' on stopping such effects.
[03:43:43] <fasta> chealey: what is the API to stop an effect?
[03:44:06] <chealey> Y eat i don't really know what I'm talking about here, I just know my team had the same problem on a site and our local JS guy did that (at least that's how it was explained to me) to fix it.
[03:44:19] <fasta> chealey: I already found it.
[03:44:31] <fasta> chealey: there is a function called 'stop'. Isn't that great? :)
[03:44:32] <chealey> fasta: cool hope that solves your problem.
[03:45:03] <chealey> fasta: glad i could be helpful to someone here haha, now to just find someone to help me :P
[03:45:34] <tarzeau> i wonder why nobody ever created an online jquery editor yet, where one can add div blocks with the mouse (selecting images, or typing text into the box) and by moving the box around (absolute: position)
[03:45:38] <tarzeau> (or can't i just find it?)
[03:45:57] <chealey> tarzeau: a lot of those exist, can't link you but i've seen several.
[03:46:22] <tarzeau> one that allows z-index settings? and transparence, rounded corners, font selector?
[03:46:29] <chealey> tarzeau: yes
[03:47:01] <chealey> tarzeau: not sure why you'd want something like that, but they do exist
[03:47:31] <fasta> chealey: what is your problem?
[03:47:53] <mario_> $('#test').css({'display' : 'block', 'top' : '75px'});
[03:47:55] <chealey>  i have a list of items (with corresponding links currently with the href set to #) and i also have a form and on that form a drop-down list with options (though not output traditionally). I need when a link is clicked, for it to set the value of the correct input field to be what it should be based on the link that was clicked, and then submit the form (so i can hide the drop down entirely as that's not how i want to output the options). Full html code can

[03:47:57] <mario_> is this syntax correct?
[03:48:00] <chealey> That ^
[03:49:08] <tarzeau> chealey: i'd like one to prototype at place things
[03:49:18] <fasta> chealey: if you know JavaScript, it is easy.
[03:49:25] <chealey> I'm starting to think now though that JS might not be the best solution, might be better to utilize url segment variables. (i just started on that train of thought now)
[03:49:36] <chealey> fasta: yeah that's the problem, i don't know JS haha
[03:50:03] <chealey> fasta: and being that it's the middle of the night i can't get any of my peers to give me a hand, hence why i'm in IRC :P
[03:50:47] <chealey> I think i've just now decided JS isn't the answer here anyways. I'm a goof.
[03:50:56] <chealey> Thanks for glancing at it for me though
[03:51:21] <fasta> chealey: you can also add an extra server round-trip, but IMHO that is a mistake.
[03:51:29] <IrishWilly>  $('#ul_list > li').click(function(){ $('#dropdown').selected = $(this).html() ; }) or something
[03:51:44] <chealey> fasta: what i'm going to end up doing is adding the value i need in that form field to segment 4 of the url
[03:51:45] <fasta> chealey: you could redesign your GUI too.
[03:52:14] <fasta> chealey: or use/modify what IrishWilly said.
[03:52:26] <chealey> fasta: and then on the next step grab the variable i need from the segment_url, that way javascript isn't needed at all and i eliminate the possibility of js being disabled.
[03:52:39] <IrishWilly> broken psuedocode, I dont know the jquery commands off the top of my head but it should be a simple one liner
[03:52:41] <chealey> fast and ireishwilly: that won't work because the entire point of this is to get rid of the drop down (hide it)
[03:53:01] <chealey> the problem is that some of this is being auto output and it's tieing my hands
[03:53:16] <IrishWilly> changing the selected value of the drop down doesn't unhide it, if the form is submitted that information still goes
[03:53:21] <chealey> I'm going to toy with my new idea i'll be back if it doesn't work but i think this new thought of utilizing url segments is actually going to be more ideal.
[03:53:27] <IrishWilly> you could just have a hidden input instead of a dropdown if you dont want the user to interact with it
[03:54:05] <chealey> irshwilly: i understand that, code i can't touch is outputting that, anyways i'll be back in a bit if my new thought doesn't work. Thanks for taking a look :)
[03:55:02] <aaronmcadam> anyone using sass?
[03:55:20] <inad922> hello
[03:56:12] <NoNoNo> aaronmcadam: yep; and I like it
[03:56:23] <aaronmcadam> yeah my first day using it
[03:56:31] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying to get a mixin to print a variable
[03:56:50] <aaronmcadam> my mixin includes this line: -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorStr='($gradFrom)', EndColorStr='$gradTo')";
[03:57:03] <aaronmcadam> seems the vars won't replace because it's inside a string NoNoNo
[03:57:16] <NoNoNo> use #{$gradFrom}
[03:57:25] <aaronmcadam> ah thanks! the docs weren't clear on that :d
[03:58:42] <aaronmcadam> nice one NoNoNo :) thank you very much!
[04:00:56] <blainsd> hi, does preventDefault() work on a select statement ?
[04:02:04] <fasta> Does jQuery also support linear gradients?
[04:02:08] <PeeterWork> It should blainsd
[04:03:11] <Cork> blainsd: it has nothing to do with the element
[04:03:26] <Cork> blainsd: it exists on all native event objects
[04:03:33] <Cork> and yes it works on all of them
[04:03:35] <blainsd> hmm odd, should it work like this ? $("#mySelect").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault();}); ?
[04:03:52] <Cork> blainsd: what is it you want to prevent?
[04:04:21] <blainsd> When the user clicks on the select element, I don't want it show the list. I want to show a custom div
[04:04:53] <Cork> blainsd: i don't think your allowed to do that
[04:05:17] <blainsd> really ?
[04:07:47] <Cork> blainsd: form elements has loads of restrictions around them
[04:07:58] <blainsd> ahh right
[04:08:19] <blainsd> I guess i need to mock on up
[04:08:21] <Cork> blainsd: you could give return false; a try
[04:08:26] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[04:08:33] <blainsd> yeah i tried that
[04:09:50] <flayks> hi there
[04:10:04] <blainsd> thanks cork, peeterWork
[04:10:07] <flayks> can i set a default value to a var if it's not defined ? like this width = $(this).attr("rel").split("w:")[1].split("t:")[0] ? "150px";
[04:10:52] <coldhead> what happens when you try that?
[04:11:28] <mario_> $('#test').css({'display' : 'block', 'top' : '75px'}); <-- Hi. Is this syntax correct?
[04:11:33] <Cork> flayks: width = $(this).attr("rel").split("w:")[1].split("t:")[0] || "150px";
[04:12:24] <Cork> marco_: yes
[04:13:42] <flayks> Cork: it's better but when i don't set the w: in the rel attribute, it returns me an error
[04:14:10] <Cork> flayks: ya you need to add a fallback for each .split too
[04:14:25] <flayks> like?
[04:14:52] <Cork> width = ($(this).attr("rel").split("w:")[1] || '').split("t:")[0] || "150px";
[04:16:38] <flayks> oh ok
[04:16:40] <flayks> thx
[04:17:38] <twoface> Hi. in a mousemove event, e.pageX is way lower than expected, and returns a negative number when being on the left side of approximately the middle of the page. What could cause this?

[04:24:21] <tankblergh> Im having some problems getting the default model binding to work in mvc 3 / ajax / json.   The data im posting has two parameters, but when I debug, the second parameter is null when I use the correct model, when I use string I get the data. Is this the right ajax posting syntax? data: { id: 1010, timeEntries: JSON.stringify(AllTimeEntries) }
[04:24:51] <tankblergh> AllTimeEntries is an array of objects
[04:25:23] <blackspotwiggins> tankblergh, maybe you should stringify the entire object not just only subset of it?
[04:25:43] <tankblergh> tried that at first, but then it said the id, the first parameter was null also
[04:26:54] <tankblergh> like this, right?  data: JSON.stringify({ id: 1010, timeEntries: AllTimeEntries})
[04:29:56] <blackspotwiggins> i don't think jquery sets data as request body
[04:30:19] <blackspotwiggins> if you'r api is solid, you should just use regular params which get serialized
[04:31:51] <blackspotwiggins> maybe if you set processdata to false
[04:32:14] <coldhead> "where you going baby? you going to dig up some corpses?"
[04:32:25] <courpse> :/
[04:32:36] <tankblergh> alright, black, thanks, ill look into it

[04:35:54] <VorTechS> hey all, does anyone know (before I try it out) if the accordion allows you to have a single header item always expanded whilst others are collapsible?
[04:37:05] <niom> hello. how can i set the anchor text with jQuery?
[04:37:20] <niom> i mean like document.location.href="#xxx"
[04:38:27] <IgnisDiabolus> $('a').attr('href','#xxx');
[04:38:38] <niom> or just what is the eqivalent jQuery-function to document.location.href?
[04:38:42] <niom> IgnisDiabolus: without a link
[04:40:20] <blackspotwiggins> niom, why do you need an alternative to location.href=
[04:40:28] <blackspotwiggins> does it not work?
[04:40:57] <niom> blackspotwiggins: i thought to work with jQuery and not just pure js
[04:41:03] <blackspotwiggins> VorTechS, accordion only has one part open at a time
[04:41:04] <niom> but i use the js-function, thanks

[04:59:55] <twoface> TrueColors, you need to wrap it in $(function() { });
[05:00:08] <twoface> or however you would like to write it
[05:00:16] <TrueColors> it's wrapped in (function($) {
[05:00:31] <TrueColors> like the rest of it
[05:00:39] <twoface> which you call with the variable jQuery before the jquery library is loaded
[05:01:16] <TrueColors> I don't get it..
[05:01:26] <TrueColors> the same JS works in jsfiddle...
[05:01:38] <aaronmcadam> i always use $( document ).ready(...) myself
[05:01:45] <twoface> because jQuery is already defined in jsfiddle
[05:01:50] <aaronmcadam> just for clarity
[05:02:22] <aaronmcadam> or else mootools, so many people don't set the library in jsfiddle :)
[05:03:01] <TrueColors> hmm
[05:03:46] <TrueColors> I thought (function($) { was used to prevent the jquery confiction... you know with other libraries that feature the use of $
[05:04:06] <twoface> amongst other things, yes
[05:04:13] <TheDemz> Code: http://jsfiddle.net/yd3Uh/ Question: How do i loop through all my .class in a form and get their id name and their value ? Thx
[05:04:37] <TrueColors> ?each
[05:04:37] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:05:15] <TrueColors> for example $(".class").each ( function () { ... grab name and value ... } );
[05:05:31] <TrueColors> well actually it wouldn't be that
[05:05:34] <Weltraumschaf> hello
[05:05:34] <TrueColors> it would be childrens...
[05:05:34] <TrueColors> idk
[05:05:46] <TheDemz> ok
[05:06:13] <TrueColors> but yeah .each would be something you'd use
[05:07:46] <KarateKip3> Hallow! I have my jQuery stuff wrapped inside (function ($) { ... })(jQuery);  I am calling a function which is inside that stuff, but it's not being called. Could it be that I have to do something like $.test() to access a function inside the wrapper?
[05:08:07] <KarateKip3> or perhaps $(function());
[05:08:14] <erichynds> add () to the end of your wrapper
[05:08:15] <Weltraumschaf> Trying to use jquery.form.js fileuplaod, but doesn't work because in the site docuemnt.domain was set and I got a access violation. can someone point me out an example how i can configure the form plugin to a different document.domain?
[05:08:16] <KarateKip3> or something else with dollar sign
[05:08:30] <KarateKip3> ok, lemme try
[05:08:41] <erichynds> ah, nm, i missed it
[05:08:44] <Cork> KarateKip3: you need to assign the function to the global scope
[05:08:57] <Cork> KarateKip3: else its not accessable the the function you call it from
[05:09:20] <Cork> KarateKip3: $(function() { window.my_func = function() {}; });
[05:09:48] <medvind> I have two conflicting timers on my page, one with setInterval set to 1 second updating a countdown (with hours, minutes, seconds) and one with setTimeout set to 4 seconds rotating an image reel. The image reel goes nuts after a while, losing its timeout setting. It only happens when the countdown script is present.  Any idea why this happens?
[05:11:07] <KarateKip3> erichynds: didn't work
[05:11:21] <erichynds> KarateKip3: i know, follow cork's advice
[05:11:43] <TrueColors> (function ($) { ... })(jQuery); ... use $(function() { ... });
[05:11:50] <nuim> hello. i need to set an attribute value, if the element has set another attribute value
[05:12:00] <nuim> this is the state
[05:12:11] <nuim> $('div').attr('x','b');
[05:12:19] <erichynds> TrueColors: those statements do different things
[05:12:21] <nuim> but only for divs who have set the attribute y
[05:13:02] <nuim> something like ('div[y!=""]').attr('x','b');
[05:13:09] <KarateKip3> Cork & TrueColors: trying... brb
[05:13:42] <nuim> can anyone help me?
[05:15:33] <Weltraumschaf> no one here with experiences about document.domain issues with iframes?
[05:16:34] <Cork> Weltraumschaf: do you mean you want to access the content of an iframe that loads from another domain?
[05:17:34] <inad922> Can I check if a given key is in a javascript associate array with syntax like "key in assocarray"?
[05:17:46] <inad922> associative*
[05:17:59] <Weltraumschaf> Cork: the problem is: the site is hosted on foo.bar.com, but in the side (for some reason) document.domain = "bar.com"; when i use the ajaxForm() with file upload the plugin can not acces the inserted iframe
[05:18:00] <Cork> inad922: javascript doens't have associative arrays
[05:18:13] <Cork> inad922: its objects, or arrays
[05:18:22] <twoface> but the answer is yes
[05:18:29] <Weltraumschaf> when i remove the docuemtn.domain = "foo.com" it works, but this is essential for some other legacy stuff on our site
[05:19:04] <Cork> Weltraumschaf: both pages has to be loaded from the same domain
[05:19:39] <inad922> umm but I can do stuff like 'var x = new Array();' and then 'x["a"] = 300;' What's that if not an associative array?
[05:19:53] <Cork> no thats a broken array
[05:19:55] <Weltraumschaf> it is the same domain: foo.bar.com. But the site whicht triggers the fileupload via ajaxform() set document.domain = "bar.com"
[05:19:58] <Cork> use var x = {};
[05:20:16] <Cork> ?eval var x = {}; x['a'] = 300;
[05:20:17] <bot-t> Cork: 300
[05:20:29] <inad922> I see
[05:20:35] <Weltraumschaf> i tried to inject an own iframe wit <script> document.domain = "bar.com"</ and pass it as iframe to ajaxForm() but doenst work
[05:20:41] <Cork> inad922: arrays should only be used for continus arrays
[05:20:42] <inad922> And can I check for 'keys' with some syntax?
[05:21:15] <TrueColors> Same as you'd check with an array.
[05:21:22] <TrueColors> if ( x [ 'a' ] ) or whatever
[05:21:22] <Weltraumschaf> inad922: if (obj.isThereakey) { ...}
[05:21:32] <TrueColors> I've never used that... blah
[05:21:34] <Cork> ?eval var x = {}; x['a'] = 300; x.hasOwnProperty('a')
[05:21:34] <bot-t> Cork: true
[05:21:38] <Cork> inad922: ^
[05:21:46] <twoface> ?eval var x = {}; x['a'] = 300; 'a' in x;
[05:21:47] <bot-t> twoface: true
[05:21:55] <inad922> Cork: Array is something like C++/STL/vector like double in size every time I give a too big index or a hashtable like python's list?
[05:22:28] <inad922> Ok I guess I go with twoface's syntax
[05:22:43] <Cork> inad922: your likly to have bugs if you use arrays for things other then continus numbers
[05:22:47] <inad922> but thanks for helping me out here Cork twoface
[05:22:56] <Cork> inad922: arrays is inherited from objects, thats why you CAN do it
[05:23:02] <Cork> but its risky
[05:23:14] <inad922> Cork: K I use this {} notation. Although I don't know what it stands for
[05:23:27] <Cork> inad922: its a primitive for Objects
[05:23:31] <blackspotwiggins> ?101 @ inad922
[05:23:31] <bot-t> inad922, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[05:23:43] <Cork> inad922: var x = new Object(); is the same as var x = {};
[05:23:47] <Articate> if I give a <div> a name, is it right that I then can't get that name with jQuery?
[05:23:52] <Cork> same with var x = Array(); var x = [];
[05:24:07] <Cork> inad922: but same again, its safer to use the primitivs
[05:24:25] <twoface> Articate, you shouldn't give a div a name - but you can get it with .attr('name')
[05:24:34] <TrueColors> How would I check if a string has atleast 1 uppercase character, and atleast 1 lowercase character?
[05:24:43] <inad922> Cork: K I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the link btw. I guess I read that tutorial before asking any further questions.
[05:24:49] <Cork> inad922: btw a side warning in doesn't check the same thing as hasOwnProperty
[05:25:10] <Cork> it checks if the object or its prototype object has the member
[05:25:15] <Articate> twoface: ah.
[05:25:31] <Articate> then maybe there's a better way of doing what I'm trying to do
[05:25:39] <Cork> inad922: so in can find functions added to Object.prototype.something = function() {};
[05:25:46] <Cork> ex.
[05:26:31] <inad922> I see.
[05:26:34] <blackspotwiggins> ?eval var a = {}; 'toString' in a;
[05:26:34] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins: true
[05:26:42] <blackspotwiggins> like that..
[05:26:59] <Articate> I have three buttons, and three tables I want to show when its corresponding button is pressed, while hiding the others
[05:27:00] <Cork> ?eval var a = {};  a.hasOwnProperty('toString');
[05:27:01] <bot-t> Cork: false
[05:27:22] <Cork> ?eval var a = { toString: 10 };  a.hasOwnProperty('toString');
[05:27:23] <bot-t> Cork: true
[05:27:51] <Articate> currently I named each <div class="button"> and tried to use that name to set the corresponding table to show, each table with an id equal to the name of its button
[05:28:57] <alaing> how do I add a callback  to my own custom functions and then call the callback?
[05:29:26] <Cork> function my_func(callback) { callback(attrs); }
[05:29:35] <Cork> and if you want to give it a this value do
[05:29:44] <Cork> function my_func(callback) { callback.call(me, attrs); }
[05:30:07] <alaing> what if a callback is not passed?
[05:30:17] <Cork> alaing: you need to check if its set
[05:30:27] <Cork> a simple if(callback) { callback(); }
[05:30:27] <zay2> Hello! i have a problem where form.serialize() fails to pick up some of form fields information. How can i fix this? The fields it fails to pick up are multipleselects
[05:30:55] <Weltraumschaf> Cork: i tried to inject an own iframe wit <script> document.domain = "bar.com"</ and pass it as iframe to ajaxForm() but doenst work
[05:30:55] <Cork> alaing: or do it the jquery way: callback = callback || $.noop;
[05:31:19] <Cork> Weltraumschaf: if the two pages isn't loaded from the same domain, the browser is MEANT to block you
[05:31:20] <alaing> Cork: would the call back be a string eg. 'function(){alert('hello')}?
[05:31:36] <Cork> alaing: no just a function() {}
[05:31:43] <Cork> or the function name without paranteses
[05:32:03] <Weltraumschaf> Cork: They are not loaded from a different domain, both come from foo.bar.com, but the main site sets docuemtn.domain = "bar.com"
[05:32:11] <alaing> I suppose I could check its set  aas well as ensure its a function
[05:32:43] <alaing> incase my function is myfunc(string,callback) and the user uses myFunc(1,2)
[05:33:14] <Cork> ?eval function run_me(callback) { if(callback) { callback(); } }; run_me(function() { print('hello'); });
[05:33:15] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[05:33:23] <Cork> alaing: thats how it works
[05:33:37] <theCode> how do you get the html value of $('#pageid_5')? I want the whole html tag of the div.
[05:33:54] <Jayflux> .html()
[05:33:58] <theCode> nah
[05:34:03] <theCode> it gets you the inner html
[05:34:16] <Cork> theCode: you would have to fiddle a bit
[05:34:17] <nuim> if ($(this).
[05:34:21] <nuim> in which case can you use this?
[05:34:30] <nuim> i mean "this"
[05:34:30] <tbranyen> theCode: $("<div/>").html( $("#pageid_5").parent() ).html()
[05:34:33] <theCode> let me try
[05:34:33] <tbranyen> but that'll get siblings
[05:34:44] <Cork> theCode: $('<div/>').append($('#pageid_5').clone()).html()
[05:34:56] <tbranyen> Cork: that still won't get the parent tag
[05:34:57] <Jayflux> could work ^
[05:35:05] <Cork> tbranyen: it will
[05:35:13] <tbranyen> Cork: it will not
[05:35:15] <tbranyen> How could it?
[05:35:16] <nuim> in which case can you use "this" like if ($(this).attr...? i know it like "<elem onclick=alert(this.id)"
[05:35:18] <Cork> it appends the #pageid_5 in a new div
[05:35:24] <tbranyen> right...
[05:35:28] <Cork> then extracts the html from the parent div
[05:35:40] <alaing> theCode: I got a lil plugin if you intereseted. kind of like an outterHTML
[05:35:40] <tbranyen> Cork: right listen to yourself
[05:35:42] <Cork> and that would include it self
[05:35:49] <tbranyen> Oh snap
[05:35:59] <tbranyen> =)
[05:36:04] <tbranyen> nice one :D
[05:36:17] <nuim> in which case can you use "this" like if ($(this).attr...? i know it like "<elem onclick=alert(this.id)"
[05:36:18] <theCode> was looking for a more native method
[05:36:20] <tbranyen> lemme take two steps back and say boom
[05:36:31] <tbranyen> theCode: its nonstandard behavior probably won't happen
[05:36:35] <Cork> theCode: that is the most native you can get
[05:36:38] <tbranyen> outerHTML isn't standardized
[05:37:39] <NetCerW> what is a way to check if there is no html between tags. eg. <p class="foo"></p>
[05:38:06] <nuim> $.fn.hasAttr = function(name) {      return this.attr(name) !== undefined; };                         is $.fn a reserved keyword or can i use fnct as well?
[05:38:43] <Jayflux> NetCerW :empty ?
[05:38:47] <Jayflux> http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[05:38:56] <nuim> $.fn.hasAttr = function(name) {      return this.attr(name) !== undefined; };                         is $.fn a reserved keyword or can i use fnct as well?
[05:39:17] <blackspotwiggins> nuim, $.fn is not a keyword on javascript
[05:39:48] <twoface> nuim, i doubt jquery will recognize the function if you put it somewhere else
[05:39:55] <twoface> NetCerW, .html()
[05:39:56] <NetCerW> Jayflux: cheers bro ;)
[05:40:15] <NetCerW> .html() or :empty?
[05:40:26] <twoface> depends on your use-case
[05:40:41] <Alex_ander> does anybody know how to parse json from youtube using a video id with getJSON?
[05:40:57] <twoface> :empty can be used as a selector, .html() enables you to remove e.g. <br /> before checking
[05:41:44] <Draex> hey
[05:41:55] <Jayflux> Draex is draveX ?
[05:42:02] <Draex> nope
[05:42:05] <blackspotwiggins> Alex_ander, getjson parses it for you
[05:42:14] <blackspotwiggins> and yes, someone knows it as well
[05:42:29] <NetCerW> twoface: so .html() is more powerful
[05:42:42] <Draex> I have problem with jQuery.parseJSON()
[05:42:45] <Jayflux> NetCerW depends
[05:42:53] <alaing> theCode: http://pastebin.com/WsGKLM9w
[05:43:32] <Draex> can somebody help me please?
[05:43:55] <alaing> Draex: wassup?
[05:44:08] <NetCerW> Jayflux: you use it like if ($('p.foo').html() == "") { do something }
[05:44:26] <Jayflux> sure
[05:44:35] <damian004> hi, i've a question
[05:44:55] <alaing> damian004: i'm yet to meet someone here who doesn't have a question
[05:44:55] <Draex> alaing: http://eshop.dttrading.sk/textil/tricka/top-damsky-impression#farba-31 - when  you write number to form and push button
[05:45:16] <theCode> thanks alaing
[05:45:33] <Draex> alaing: using ajax, server will return JSON string
[05:45:47] <zay2> I have a problem with form.serialize() and it looks like form.serialize() fails to serialize elements which were added to form after the page load. Has anyone had such a problem before?
[05:46:20] <Alex_ander> blackspotwiggins I would need a little bit of help or an instruction to go ahead with it
[05:46:44] <Draex> alaing: but parsing using $.parseJSON will crash: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
[05:47:01] <KarateKip3> I tried several configurations but can't get any functions to work inside (function ($) { ... })(jQuery);  Also tried adding () at the end of the latter. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/R9QEK/
[05:47:15] <Draex> alaing: cosole links to function in jquery file
[05:47:22] <alaing> theCode: no prob
[05:47:36] <KarateKip3> if i remove (function ($) { ... })(jQuery); it will work fine. Why doesn't this work?
[05:47:45] <damian004> i want to have a event, when i click and move mouse without unclick
[05:47:59] <alaing> Draex: Looking at what gets returned from your server you have malformed JSON
[05:48:09] <Bubbi> zay2: It shouldn't have any problems as far as I remember. Have you given the new elements a name attribute? that is required for the serialization
[05:48:18] <damian004> so, click -> shake, shake (event) -> unclick
[05:48:22] <damian004> like a paint
[05:48:23] <damian004> ;>
[05:48:28] <damian004> for example
[05:49:06] <zay2> Bubbi - yeah the new elements have both names and id's
[05:49:37] <Draex> alaing: it's generated using PHP function json_encode() - pls what's specifically wrong in JSON?
[05:49:39] <m3l7> hi
[05:49:51] <m3l7> what does this selector selects? $("<div/>")
[05:49:58] <anli_> It creates a div
[05:50:07] <alaing> Draex: any chance you can simplify what is being returned from the server
[05:50:09] <m3l7> oh ok, thanks
[05:50:21] <zay2> Bubbi - what i see though is that the script that adds new elements to form also changes the name of the existing elements - could this be causing problems?
[05:50:40] <damian004> so, alaing could u help me?
[05:51:24] <Bubbi> zay2: It might have something to do with it. I'm just making a small test myself here, just to be sure :-)
[05:51:41] <carli> Hi, have one question about serializing form after cloning some object in IE. Serialize result doesn't contains cloned objects. Any clue about this?
[05:51:59] <Narhir> can I somehow user "hover" here instead of .click ?
[05:52:01] <Narhir> "h3.showmore").click(function()
[05:52:12] <alaing> damian004:  I didn't say I would help...... I just said most people here have a question no point in stating the obvious
[05:52:33] <alaing> Draex: according to firebug JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data
[05:52:53] <zay2> Bubbi - btw - before form serialize() i did console.log(form.children('select') and got empty array. So i think there is some problem with form object initialization or something - by the time form variable has been set to 'form' object there are no selects in form inner html
[05:52:58] <NetCerW> Narhir: $('h3.showmore').mouseover(function(e) {});
[05:53:01] <anli_> alaing: Do you have extra lines after ?>
[05:53:22] <anli_> Assuming you use php
[05:53:41] <alaing> anli_: I dont have issue its Draex I'm trying to help
[05:53:47] <anli_> oh
[05:53:49] <anli_> sorry
[05:54:04] <Narhir> NetCerW : thanks lets hope it will work :>
[05:54:04] <alaing> he says he is using php json_encode()
[05:54:08] <anli_> I did not read Dreax: :)
[05:54:10] <Narhir> why you added this (e) ?
[05:54:12] <Narhir> inside function ?
[05:54:34] <Bubbi> zay2: When do you do the serialization? OnSubmit or before? It sounds a bit like it runs too early..
[05:55:17] <NetCerW> what is the point of serialising form data on submit?
[05:55:40] <Draex> alaing: jQuery have to in parseJSON trim string..
[05:56:48] <tankblergh> blackspotwiggins, you gave me some advice on ajax post a few hours ago, parameters turned out to be null in the action method. Well, I discovered that I had forgotten this: contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8', That made a difference :)
[05:57:07] <blackspotwiggins> tankblergh, dataType : "json" does that
[05:57:10] <blackspotwiggins> as well
[05:57:21] <tankblergh> strange, I have that too...
[05:57:31] <pachet> NetCerW: ensures that php can do something with the passed query string
[05:57:33] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe that sets accept
[05:59:06] <zay2> Bubbi - the whole series of events goes like that 1) form is loaded on page with html. 2) jquery events are bound 3) script is run, which creates additional select event and switches existing select and new select name parameters. 4) i click submit button to post form with ajax and console.log( ) is ran in this proces which prints out that form has no 'select' children
[05:59:27] <Bubbi> zay2: here is a very basic example: http://jsbin.com/udakub  - when you press the submit button, an input is inserted and afterwards the form is serialized.
[05:59:39] <alaing> Draex: can you simplify your json object to see if its perhaps your content that you are returning thats causing the error
[06:00:25] <NetCerW> pachet: don't you usually use $_POST or $_GET to grab form data once JS validation passes? didn't know that some people are using data passed directly from JS, seems unsafe.
[06:00:28] <Draex> alaing: it's simplifed now
[06:00:34] <zay2> bubbi - yeah it works just fine. wonder why im getting this problem then :/
[06:00:42] <Bubbi> zay2: Are the <select> boxes direct children of the form? or are they inside a <div>, <p> or the like?
[06:00:49] <zay2> no they are in divs
[06:01:05] <Bubbi> zay2: Then that's your problem.. .children() only fetches direct children.
[06:01:06] <zay2> But that also aint problem in itself - tested it in jsfiddle
[06:01:09] <Draex> alaing: oh :) now I see problem
[06:01:18] <zay2> bubbi ah yes - it fixes console.log problem
[06:01:19] <Draex> alaing: thank you very much
[06:01:49] <Bubbi> zay2: oh buggars.. it was only the console.log problem :-)
[06:01:59] <Bubbi> zay2: If you have the jsfiddle page, I can take a look at it?
[06:02:13] <alaing> Draex: not a problem sometimes its better to simplify the problem before you can spot what went wrong.
[06:03:01] <zay2> Bubbi  - using .find() instead of children() finds both the selects so it makes me wonder why arent they serialized()
[06:03:03] <nuim> var x = $('div').hasAttr('y');                      why is this function just called for the first element found and not all divs?
[06:03:10] <Draex> alaing: again a little wiser :)
[06:03:37] <zay2> Bubbi - i'll see if i can put up jsfiddle.
[06:04:16] <Bubbi> zay2: Yeah, it would be great if I see the actual code that you use to serialize the form with. I think it might help me help you :-P
[06:05:43] <aaronmcadam> should be using ?serialize
[06:05:52] <r1ch> hi
[06:05:59] <pachet> NetCerW: always a little unsafe, but it does a good job of preventing js injection
[06:06:06] <pachet> encodes special chars and such
[06:06:20] <r1ch> got a problem with the query combo box was wondering if anyone could have a look?
[06:06:22] <pachet> as for when to use it, it gets a little ugly trying to pass a form with 40 values as POST
[06:06:23] <r1ch> http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/javascript-15/jquery-ajax-call-preventing-jquery-ui-combobox-select-firing-779522.html
[06:06:44] <pachet> serialize can do it in one line, then you just have to explode it on the backend
[06:07:55] <NetCerW> pachet: if your doing server-side validation then i don't see the point of it.
[06:08:12] <DimmuR> Hi I'm using jquery with datatables plugin. I'm currently trying to remove last row from table (i want to remove whole table) but seems like when fnGetNodes() == 1 callback function isn't available to click and row stays - any ideas how to remove table when last row is removed?
[06:09:50] <Alex_ander> how would I do to get the video title? http://jsfiddle.net/Tm9kb/
[06:09:52] <pachet> NetCerW: still the issue of reading through lots of form data before submit, assuming you cant just submit() for whatever reason
[06:10:46] <pachet> also, using serialize is a blind ref to everything in the form
[06:10:59] <alaing> r1ch:  what do you mean "prevents combobox form firing?
[06:11:21] <pachet> meaning you can change form structure without having to modify your ajax/json/what have you to reference the new elements
[06:11:58] <NetCerW> pachet: sorry i must have joined the conservation late because i don't quite follow the concept of serialising form data using JS.
[06:12:26] <zay2> bubbi - jsfiddle is up - http://jsfiddle.net/tBvJX/9/. use add/remove to move users between selects and then try serializing it by pressing submit
[06:12:42] <r1ch> alaing: the select event doesent run when the item is selected from the list
[06:12:58] <blackspotwiggins> Alex_ander, http://jsfiddle.net/Tm9kb/1/
[06:13:04] <blackspotwiggins> lrn2jsonp
[06:13:19] <alaing> r1ch: how are you bind the events?
[06:14:06] <alaing> r1ch: any chance you got a demo or can you create a working demo on jsbin.com?
[06:14:14] <r1ch> alaing: the problem only seems to occur when the ajax call returns the results which it does fine but the select doesn't fire
[06:14:15] <Alex_ander> blackspotwiggins I'm trying to learn...
[06:14:23] <r1ch> alaing: sure one minute
[06:14:30] <alaing> r1ch: sorry meant jsfiddle.net
[06:14:31] <zay2> Bubbi - or better yet - try this one  http://jsfiddle.net/tBvJX/11/ and move some options from upper select to lwer - and as you can see - as far as the printout is concerned none of the selects is actually selected
[06:14:50] <blackspotwiggins> Alex_ander, you could have checked what ?callback= does
[06:14:56] <TheDemz> whats the syntax for finding a selector that has a substring "chooseReport" in the ID ? thx
[06:14:56] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe tried using jquery in jsfiddle
[06:15:00] <blackspotwiggins> so try harder
[06:17:09] <kborchers> TheDemz: $("[id*='chooseReport']");
[06:17:20] <pachet> NetCerW: it's a utility more than a security measure
[06:17:28] <pachet> here's a good illustration of what i mean: http://www.yourinspirationweb.com/en/how-and-when-to-use-jquerys-serialize-method/
[06:17:36] <Bubbi> zay2: 2 seconds, i'll just go through them :-)
[06:18:00] <TheDemz> kborchers LOVE YOU! :D
[06:18:05] <NetCerW> pachet: how so is it a utility?
[06:18:51] <pachet> NetCerW: saves you having to reference individual form elements when sending data async
[06:19:39] <Alex_ander> blackspotwiggins can you please show me how to get the video title so I can take it from there?
[06:20:30] <blackspotwiggins> Alex_ander, no. my example is already almost there.
[06:20:38] <NetCerW> pachet: i might have to read the url because i don't follow the "reference individual form elements" part.
[06:20:43] <blackspotwiggins> Alex_ander, if you can figure out what to do next you might consider changing careers
[06:21:19] <zay2> Bubbi - guess the problem is that the script that moves those options around does not actually set selected parameter
[06:21:32] <zay2> bubbi and thats why the serialize() does not pick them up
[06:22:22] <Bubbi> zay2: I don't think that I am seeing exactly what you are seeing. I am getting a javascript error "interpolate is not defined" in SelectFilter2.js
[06:22:51] <zay2> on both of those links?
[06:23:09] <pachet> NetCerW: if you're sending form data to a script with ajax, for instance, then you can't get away with the form's native ('submit') method, because that would force a page refresh and you dont want that. so you have to catch all the form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes) whose data you want to send, strip their values, and pack them into an ajax or json call or some such. so your call would have a params argument that li
[06:23:50] <zay2> Bubbi - looks like this error shows up in firefox but not in chrome where i am testing it
[06:23:52] <pachet> Serialize removes that consideration by packing everything into one line of code that fires irrespective of what the individual form elements are
[06:24:24] <r1ch> alaing: http://jsfiddle.net/nxktP/
[06:24:51] <Bubbi> zay2: weird, but it might be related to the problem?
[06:25:30] <NetCerW> pachet: i c. but you still would need to unserialise on server-side and reference individual elements to validate?
[06:25:55] <zay2> bubbi - dont think so - i believe its only problem that the options arent selected any more after beeing moved from one select to another
[06:27:13] <Bubbi> zay2: I think that you need to select all values in one of the select-boxes just before you do a serialize
[06:27:32] <pachet> NetCerW: yeah
[06:27:44] <NetCerW> NetCerW: i guess it does save some space and time serialising on the client-side. Thanks!
[06:28:12] <pachet> NetCerW: bear in mind that methods like POST and GET are really serializations themselves, its just that js and php do the work of packing and unpacking the query strings automatically
[06:28:19] <zay2> Bubbi - exactly, which is exactly what i found - that elements arent selected any more after moving around. you select element to move it, but its not selected any more in 2nd "select"
[06:29:27] <NetCerW> pachet: not sure about that. i believe its sent across HTTP as plain text (not serialised).
[06:29:37] <wilfredh> jQuery has functions returnTrue and and returnFalse: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L600 -- any idea why?
[06:29:41] <zay2> Bubbi - thanks for your time :). That was the problem...
[06:30:13] <Bubbi> zay2: you are most welcome. It's always nice to squash a bug or two :-)
[06:30:28] <nuim> does anyone know which datatype this is? $(this)           an array of objects or what?
[06:30:35] <ajpiano> wilfredh: DRY
[06:30:42] <ajpiano> nuim: ...it's a jQuery object like any other
[06:30:47] <DevBrPb> hi to all
[06:31:16] <nuim> ajpiano: okay and how can i iterate over it? with a simple for loop?
[06:31:24] <ajpiano> ?each
[06:31:25] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[06:31:26] <r1ch> http://jsfiddle.net/nxktP/ - can anyone see why the select isn't firing with the ajax call?
[06:31:42] <DevBrPb> anybody have a sample custom the like button of facebook, change the class of css using toggleclass to use anoher icon?
[06:31:57] <Nasga> Does anyone know a "clean" way to block the back button ? I have to support an old framed real time application and i just noticed some users use the back button and have trouble with this...
[06:32:02] <zay2> Bubbi - the scripts that were added to page were part of django (djangoproject.org). I read through them and found that when you move elements between selects, the elements are cached and after each move, the options of both selects are created anew from SelectBox objects inner Cache... so thats why they werent selected any more
[06:32:44] <Bubbi> zay2: Ah, nicely spotted :-)
[06:34:01] <pachet> NetCerW: i guess it depends on your definition of "serialize," -- i just mean that the data is compiled into a single string that has to be decompiled on the other side
[06:34:59] <wilfredh> ajpiano: ah, it's used for isDefaultPrevented and similar. Make sense :)
[06:35:06] <ajpiano> yep
[06:35:22] <ajpiano> wilfredh: pretty much the same reason we have jQuery.noop instead of function(){} all over the place
[06:36:03] <NetCerW> pachet: then thats not what serialise means. serialise means a byte-stream representation of a value.
[06:36:41] <NetCerW> pachet: but i get what you are saying.
[06:37:18] <NetCerW> pachet: bye bye now
[06:37:30] <pachet> NetCerW: in which case, serialize() is missnamed?
[06:37:46] <pachet> from jquery.com: The .serialize() method creates a text string in standard URL-encoded notation.
[06:37:51] <ajpiano> serialize is clearly not misnamed
[06:38:23] <alaing> r1ch: sorry could you post that example url again my machine rebooted just as i saw you post come up
[06:38:25] <ajpiano> dude just has a very specific definition of serialize which in fact disqualifies things that clearly are serialization
[06:47:07] <r1ch> alaing: http://jsfiddle.net/nxktP/
[06:51:38] <alaing> r1ch: results returns undefined
[06:52:45] <r1ch> alaing: sorry i replaced the datasource, it works with the datasource used and returns the <li> just doesn't allow you to select the <li> and fire the select

[06:58:41] <KarateKip3> i'm about to give up on this. How to execute the functions within this wrapper properly? --> http://jsfiddle.net/R9QEK/4/
[06:59:46] <ajpiano> those functions are private to the closure, you can't invoke them from the outside
[06:59:55] <ajpiano> unless you expose them somehow
[07:00:23] <KarateKip3> ajpiano: how to expose those functions?
[07:00:29] <danzik17> KarateKip3: http://jsfiddle.net/R9QEK/5/
[07:00:32] <r1ch> alaing: any idea?
[07:00:39] <ajpiano> the real question is why are you writing them inside that closure in the first place
[07:01:15] <KarateKip3> ajpiano: library conflicts. I have done this long time ago and it used to work fine.
[07:01:22] <KarateKip3> danzik17: thnx, will have a look
[07:01:37] <ajpiano> so then write all the jQuery inside of one closure where you aren't gonna run into privacy issues
[07:01:41] <ajpiano> or.... learn how scope works in JS
[07:01:42] <ajpiano> :p
[07:01:53] <Woet> or don't you use conflicting frameworks
[07:01:59] <Woet> -you
[07:02:08] <pachet> dont you do it!
[07:03:03] <KarateKip3> hmm... i'm not an expert on JS and jQuery, trying to learn along the way
[07:03:24] <Narhir> is there an easy way to make jQuery ui accordion to work on hover instead on click ?
[07:04:02] <alaing> Narhir: yes use the hover event?
[07:04:02] <kborchers> Narhir: by reading the docs http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#mouseover
[07:04:04] <Woet> Narhir: reading the docs?
[07:04:07] <Woet> yea
[07:04:09] <Woet> what kborchers said
[07:04:11] <ajpiano> KarateKip3: well then now is a good time to take a pit stop
[07:04:12] <ajpiano> ;)
[07:04:27] <|RicharD|> hi
[07:04:32] <Narhir> thank you guys :)
[07:04:35] <|RicharD|> why console say me: $ is not a function ?
[07:04:36] <Narhir> was reading it but couldnt find..
[07:04:38] <Narhir> I must be blind..
[07:04:52] <|RicharD|> i find a workaround but...i want know because it say me this error
[07:05:02] <ajpiano> |RicharD| http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8
[07:05:06] <alaing> Narhir: you were reading it but couldn't find....wtf?
[07:05:53] <alaing> r1ch: I can see wha tyou trying to do but I cant see why it doesn't work. have you tried copying all the code from the combobox example and then tweaking it to your needs?
[07:06:06] <|RicharD|> yesssssss
[07:06:13] <|RicharD|> i resolved the problem
[07:06:17] <|RicharD|> i'm under joomla :)
[07:06:22] <|RicharD|> shit joomla :D
[07:06:28] <|RicharD|>  thx a lot
[07:06:57] <r1ch> alaing: yes I've taken that straight from the combo box example to try and figure out why it wasn't working
[07:07:34] <alaing> r1ch: but there is quiet a bit missing like destroy etc
[07:07:49] <|RicharD|> i had: $('#navmenu li a[href="/' + path + '"]').addClass('attivo'); and it add the class to a attributes
[07:07:56] <|RicharD|> how i can add to the parent li ?
[07:08:02] <ajpiano> ?parent()
[07:08:02] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[07:08:18] <|RicharD|> very nice :)
[07:08:35] <r1ch> alaing: sorry yes i removed that but the combo box still works if i return the data not via the ajax success call which is the strange thing
[07:08:56] <alaing> r1ch:  i think its replacing the select list items and therefore is killing the select event so it makes it look like its selecting it
[07:09:30] <alaing> r1ch: might be working asking ajpiano nicely to take a look
[07:09:43] <ajpiano> ajpiano isn't lookin at that right now
[07:09:47] <ajpiano> sorry
[07:10:31] * alaing passes a beer under the table to ajpiano
[07:11:15] <r1ch> alaing: the strange thing is even returning the same data but placing it inside the ajax success call is the only thing that causes it not to fire the select
[07:11:41] <austinbv>       new Highcharts.Chart(chart_options)

[07:13:23] <alaing> r1ch: i can take another look a later today but i need to get some work done
[07:13:44] * alaing is drinking a nice BIG glass of chocolate nes-quik
[07:14:08] <r1ch> alaing: sure, cheers for your help anyway

[07:28:40] <sphinxxx> i looked in the response and postmsg element is definitely there
[07:29:44] <ajpiano> sphinxxx: check what the structure of $(msg) is, #postmsg might be a top level element and you might need to use .filter() instead of .find()
[07:31:35] <sphinxxx> oh
[07:31:40] <sphinxxx> i see its above the <html>

In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[08:00:45] <foo> kborchers: although it's 8am, you're making me hungry already. :) Thank you
[08:01:29] <pachet> foo: ive written hash change pages in the past and ive found that bbq is kind of bloated
[08:01:46] <foo> pachet: interesting, what do you recommend?
[08:01:48] <pachet> its a hack and a half to get ie6 and 7 to work with hash change events ; /
[08:02:01] <foo> pachet: If it works in chrome, I'm happy (for this particular project)
[08:02:04] <foo> pachet: got a link handy?
[08:02:52] <kborchers> pachet, foo: if you're worried about size, you can always just use the hashchange piece http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[08:03:15] <pachet> ^ what i was just going to recommend
[08:03:36] <b1lly> how come when i'm in a loop and i do var blah += 5;           it just keeps returning "5"
[08:03:40] <b1lly> instead of 5, 10, 15, 20
[08:03:56] <pachet> b1lly because you're redeclaring the variable
[08:04:07] <foo> kborchers: thanks, I kind of am
[08:04:37] <sphinxxx> i need an autocomplete plugin that will show certain values in the autocomplete dropdown box, but once an item is selected, it will show a different value (mapped to the one chosen)
[08:04:37] <alaing> ?down jsfiddle.net
[08:04:39] <sphinxxx> is this possible?
[08:04:39] <bot-t> alaing, It's just you. - http://jsfiddle.net is up.
[08:04:46] <foo> pachet: thanks a ton
[08:04:47] <Pymous> Hello !
[08:05:00] <alaing> sphinxxx: yes read the docs
[08:05:10] <pachet> foo: yw :D
[08:05:11] <alaing> ?autocomplete @ sphinxxx
[08:05:11] <bot-t> sphinxxx, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[08:05:45] <Pet^Aw> hi
[08:06:18] <alaing> sphinxxx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data look at the select function
[08:07:49] <Pymous> How I can get the selected option from a select input with JQuery ? :)
[08:08:28] <Pet^Aw> i have a problem with $.post() function that not execute his internal call, but only resfresh the page
[08:09:08] <alaing> Pymous: $('select option:selected')?
[08:09:25] <kborchers> Pymous: for the value, just use .val() if you need the actual option element ^^^
[08:09:32] <Pymous> alaing > I meant, after a choice ^^
[08:09:51] <alaing> wtf?
[08:10:17] <Pymous> When a user CHOOSE an option :)
[08:10:18] <alaing> Pymous: >< change events?
[08:10:41] <Pymous> Yeah, that's what i'm doing, but I can't hook the value afterwards
[08:10:58] <alaing> $(this) or this.value?
[08:11:42] <alaing> Pymous: how are you binding the change event. do you add the select after page load?
[08:11:52] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/45/
[08:11:58] <Pymous> Here is my actual code
[08:12:19] <neoesque> Hi, all. I have a problem with triggering different click functions contineously. http://jsfiddle.net/Tbegg/
[08:12:45] <neoesque> when clicking '.selectOneRow' directly, it works fine.
[08:13:00] <superjacaman> Pymous $("select").val();
[08:13:24] <Pymous> superjacaman > Thanks you :)
[08:14:07] <neoesque> when clicking '#selectAll', it triggers '.selectOneRow' first. It seems the $(this).prop('checked') value is wrong.
[08:14:08] <alaing> Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/46/
[08:14:41] <stede> hi ... how can i refresh the content of an (ajax) tab (using standard ui)?!
[08:14:47] <Dave-Stein> If I bind an event to an element, and then remove its parent, does that remove the event from memory?
[08:14:55] <Dave-Stein> just read this article: http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/organizing-events-with-jquery/
[08:14:57] <neoesque> Browser runs the callback function first and then clicks the element
[08:15:02] <ajpiano> Dave-Stein: yes
[08:15:04] <Dave-Stein> he says he uses delegate so destroying parent element would kill the events
[08:15:09] <Dave-Stein> so is that wrong?
[08:15:26] <ajpiano> i kinda thought that article was middling at best
[08:15:27] <ajpiano> :/
[08:15:28] <Dave-Stein> i mean he says he uses delegate over bind
[08:15:35] <krz> parseFloat(5.80) returns 5.8. i need it to return with at least 2 digits behind the decimal
[08:15:38] <krz> so 5.80
[08:15:47] <ajpiano> Dave-Stein: delegate will obviously bind fewer handlers to begin with though
[08:15:49] <krz> what am i doing wrong?
[08:15:55] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano you should comment saying that bind would work as well if he's wrong
[08:15:56] <Dave-Stein> true
[08:16:44] <BillCriswell> Are there any big differences from including a tracking pixel or just sending an ajax request?
[08:16:52] <hellyeah> hey
[08:17:05] <ajpiano> Dave-Stein: quote me ;)
[08:17:14] <hellyeah> this is the web site i made www.mahirahsap.com. There is a problem. In index.html, there is a slide in the top of the page but this slider is functional in firefox and is not functional in chrome. While using chrome you click "ana sayfa" slider appears. I cannot find the problem can someone help me to find out here is the code http://dpaste.com/hold/605238/
[08:17:18] <BillCriswell> Oh, same domain policy.
[08:17:21] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[08:17:45] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano haha i don't wanna start that fight. ive followed that guy for ages he seems pretty cool ;)
[08:17:53] <ajpiano> he's cool and all
[08:18:02] <krz> anyone?
[08:18:29] <ajpiano> i am just saying that that article was like, :||
[08:18:38] <Dave-Stein> yeah i know
[08:18:50] <Dave-Stein> i already wrote down there about how i deal with context
[08:18:53] <Dave-Stein> with jquery events
[08:18:56] <Dave-Stein> i dont like anon functions much
[08:19:06] <Dave-Stein> $dashboard.delegate(#myButton,click, { dashboard: this }, this.selectedOption);
[08:19:06] <Dave-Stein> then in selectedOption Id do: var dashboard = e.data.dashboard.
[08:19:09] <dcarper> anyone use jqmobile? and implement a simple state select drop down?
[08:19:18] <ajpiano> i always use $.proxy or _.bind or Function.prototype.bind in those scenarios
[08:19:54] * ajpiano comments
[08:20:05] <pachet> krz: parseFloat will only give you back however many digits you need to represent
[08:20:25] <pachet> since the 0 is only conveying precision, js omits it
[08:20:53] <pachet> krz: use toFixed(2)
[08:21:23] <thomb> hi, i want to create several ui sliders and i want to pass a default value to them (i.e set in a hidden field). is something like this possible? $(".res_slider").slider( "option", "value", $('#'+$(this).attr('class')+'_value').val() ); ? slider width class slider_test should load the value from slider_test_value
[08:21:27] <krz> thanks pachet
[08:21:37] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano $.proxy looks cool - i don't know why i never noticed that function before
[08:21:42] <ajpiano> heh
[08:21:49] <Dave-Stein> guess i had an available solution so i didnt look harder
[08:24:10] <ThePendulum> Hey
[08:24:20] <ThePendulum> I was wondering, can I set an animation any slower than 'slow'?
[08:24:34] <ajpiano> ThePendulum: put any number in as the speed
[08:24:40] <ajpiano> or add your own speed
[08:24:51] <ajpiano> $.fx.speeds.molasses = 10000
[08:25:04] <ThePendulum> I know, but if I put a number, it just looks like it ch'oses 'fast
[08:25:10] <ThePendulum> *chooses
[08:25:14] <kborchers> ThePendulum: I would try "over 9000" ;)
[08:25:20] <pachet> ^
[08:25:33] <kborchers> just kidding, but the number is in milliseconds so ...
[08:25:35] <ThePendulum> I set it to 8000 before which should 8 seconds in my logic :P but it just animates fast
[08:25:37] <BillCriswell> thomb: Why not just pass the "value" parameter?
[08:25:50] <ThePendulum> is there anything else I should add to it?
[08:26:52] <kborchers> ThePendulum: what are you animating? see ?demo
[08:26:52] <bot-t> ThePendulum, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:27:53] <ThePendulum> http://94.228.211.26
[08:27:59] <ThePendulum> It's about the 'learn more' button
[08:28:09] <ThePendulum> Do you guys have Chrome or anything, to simulate conditions?
[08:29:34] <stede> how to reload content of an already selected tab using ui-tabs (ajax style)?
[08:29:52] <thomb> BillCriswell: just got it with an each loop
[08:30:02] <thomb> BillCriswell: $(".res_slider").each(function() {
[08:30:02] <thomb> default_value = $('#'+$(this).attr('id')+'_value').val();
[08:30:02] <thomb> $(this).slider( "option", "value", default_value);
[08:30:02] <thomb> });
[08:30:07] <kborchers> ThePendulum: if i run $('#explain').slideToggle(5000); in the Chrome console, it runs very slow. you are passing the number as an int and not as a string right? so not like $('#explain').slideToggle('5000');
[08:30:15] <manitu> hi.. how can i give a variable value into a anon function in a request? like that, but it should alert the i to the time i posted the request, not at the actual time http://pastebin.com/AcQQ4Zfq
[08:30:22] <ajpiano> ThePendulum: if i do $.fx.speeds.slow = 8000 that works just fine
[08:30:24] <Pet^Aw> my problem with the $.post() function is: Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)
[08:30:25] <ajpiano> as well
[08:30:29] <Pet^Aw> someone can help me ?
[08:30:35] <thomb> BillCriswell: or is there an smarter solution?
[08:30:53] <fuchstronaut> I'd like to use an instance of simplexmlelement inside my own class, but i need it to be extended. is there a way to initiate a class inside of a class?
[08:31:08] <julian3387> hi everybody
[08:31:15] <bitwise_> hi
[08:31:18] <fuchstronaut> Im in the wrong channel
[08:31:22] <fuchstronaut> what do?
[08:31:24] <fuchstronaut> sorry
[08:31:38] <pachet> ThePendulum: yeah it sounds like jquery is evaluating the integer value of the string 8000
[08:31:42] <BillCriswell> thomb: You can just do $('.res_slider').slider( { value: 50 } ); if they're all the same default.
[08:31:58] <thomb> BillCriswell: no every slider needs another init value
[08:32:10] <ThePendulum> pachet: What exactly does it mean when jquery evaluates the integer value of the string 8000?
[08:32:28] <pachet> ThePendulum: actually scratch that
[08:32:35] <pachet> its defaulting to 'normal' as per animate specs
[08:32:44] <stede> no one an idea?
[08:32:46] <stede> how to reload content of an already selected tab using ui-tabs (ajax style)?
[08:33:04] <BlaDe^> how can I add a thead/tbody to a table via jq ?
[08:33:19] <fuchstronaut> (BlaDe^): append, prepend, appendTo
[08:33:20] <ThePendulum> pachet: Any idea how to prevent this from happening?
[08:33:25] <BlaDe^> I'd liek to do it on the back-end but it's generated through a code igniter library which doesn't allow you to adjust the template enough
[08:33:36] <BlaDe^> fuchstronaut: sure, but i'm not sure on the correct selector?
[08:33:40] <BillCriswell> thomb: $('.res_slider').slider({ value: $('.selector').val() }); maybe?
[08:34:02] <fuchstronaut> (BlaDe^): if i understood you right: $('table').append('thead')
[08:34:23] <BlaDe^> fuchstronaut: wouldn't that turn <table> <tr> .... </tr> </table> into </table> <thead></thead> <tr>..</tr></table> ?
[08:34:58] <fuchstronaut> I think i did not understood you, what are you trying to do again?
[08:35:09] <BlaDe^> I have <table> <tr> <th></th> <th></th> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </table>
[08:35:25] <BlaDe^> I want <table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
[08:35:36] <fuchstronaut> oh okey
[08:35:44] <Pet^Aw> Someone can help me with my problem with the $.post() function, the error is: Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)
[08:35:50] <BlaDe^> so $('table tr:first').replaceWith(....); perhaps ?
[08:36:02] <hellyeah> pls someone help me
[08:36:22] <fuchstronaut> this is a little more complicated
[08:36:27] <hellyeah> this is the web site i made www.mahirahsap.com. There is a problem. In index.html, there is a slide in the top of the page but this slider is functional in firefox and is not functional in chrome. While using chrome you click "ana sayfa" slider appears. I cannot find the problem can someone help me to find out here is the code http://dpaste.com/hold/605238/
[08:36:37] <kborchers> BlaDe^: $("table th").wrap("<thead />"); $("table tr").wrap("<tbody />");
[08:36:43] <hellyeah> i update jquery from 1.3.2 to 1.6.0
[08:36:56] <Brodingo> hellyeah no one wants to dig through your wall of code to find whats wrong
[08:37:06] <fuchstronaut> (kborchers): will this wrap the tr's?
[08:37:28] <hellyeah> Brodingo:  i hope may be someone did
[08:37:36] <BlaDe^> kborchers: wouldn't it be $("table tr:not(:first)").wrap("<tbody />") ?
[08:37:59] <Brodingo> hellyeah and im using chrome and the slider thing works fine
[08:38:06] <kborchers> BlaDe^: yep, my bad
[08:38:10] <ajpiano> oh god don't wrap things into tbodies on the fly... browser already puts tbodies there even if you don't type em :/
[08:38:17] <BlaDe^> ok, thanks kborchers! didn't know of .wrap()
[08:38:24] <BlaDe^> ajpiano: I need to add the thead for the .dataTable() plugin
[08:38:28] <ajpiano> glwtd
[08:38:38] <BlaDe^> but the codeigniter table library doesn't allow me to add <thead></thead> into the template
[08:38:50] <BlaDe^> http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/table.html
[08:40:37] <BlaDe^> kborchers: nope that doens't work. I'll create a fiddle
[08:41:25] <kborchers> BlaDe^: ajpiano is right, don't try to add those dynamically because some browsers add them on their own
[08:42:15] <BlaDe^> http://www.datatables.net/ <- this plugin breaks without a <thead>
[08:42:16] <Dave-Stein> ajpiano just swapped out several things for proxy in the new app im making haha glad i only have two controllers so far ;)
[08:42:22] <BlaDe^> I guess I'll make a preg_replace to do it in php then
[08:42:31] <ajpiano> ;)
[08:45:38] <pachet> ThePendulum: http://jsfiddle.net/nGbsC/   assuming quotes are your problem, but maybe not. your source just shows 'slow' so im not sure how you're specifing an integer speed
[08:45:54] <BillCriswell> thomb: Got it!
[08:47:14] <BillCriswell> thomb: http://pastie.org/pastes/2454968/text then you can just do... <div class="slider" data-default-value="25"></div> etc, etc
[08:50:53] <Dave-Stein> is anyone else noticing jsfiddle being slow lately?
[08:51:55] <kborchers> Dave-Stein: yep, it is usually slow for me in the am (Chicago area), but then speeds up later in the afternoon
[08:52:09] <Dave-Stein> kborchers thanks
[08:52:17] <Dave-Stein> glad im not crazy ha
[08:54:30] <Pet^Aw> Someone can help me with my problem with the $.post() function, the error is: Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)

[08:55:24] <bot-t> Pet^Aw, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:57:11] <ThePendulum> Did anyone managed to solve my issue yet? I didn't pay attention. You don't have to retype it, I just want to know if it's worth scrolling back :P
[08:58:49] <enjoycrf> waat?
[08:59:00] <thomb> BillCriswell: nice :) thank you i'll try that
[08:59:09] <BillCriswell> thomb: Sweeet.
[09:00:53] <r1ch> ajpiano: have you got a minute to look at http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/javascript-15/jquery-ajax-call-preventing-jquery-ui-combobox-select-firing-779522.html
[09:00:53] <thomb> BillCriswell: yeah :) works fine :D
[09:01:07] <ikla> $("select:[name=FA89] option[value^='thX1'],option[value^='thX2'],").removeAttr("disabled");
[09:01:08] <ajpiano> no, sorry :/
[09:01:18] <ikla> when doing that it disables options in other select name=XXX's
[09:01:23] <ikla> am I missing something?
[09:01:50] <ikla> sorry I have .attr("disabled", "true"); on the end
[09:02:22] <BillCriswell> thomb: Awesome.
[09:02:23] <ajpiano> ikla: yes
[09:02:41] <ajpiano> you're missing the fact that the second selector is entirely independent of the "select" from the first part before the comma
[09:02:50] <kborchers> ThePendulum: seriously? we already told you in a number of ways to set your duration to an integer. var anDuration = 5000; have you tried that?
[09:03:01] <ajpiano> $("select#whatever").find("option[what], option[ever]")
[09:03:12] <enjoycrf> lol
[09:03:15] <enjoycrf> whatever
[09:04:08] <krz> i dont get this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Highlight#option-color where do i specify the color?
[09:04:16] <lacrymology> how can I make a cycling "." ".." "..." appear in a <div> while I wait for an AJAX response?
[09:04:24] <krz> $(this).effect("highlight", {}, 3000);

[09:04:44] <enjoycrf> that would be fun tho
[09:04:51] <enjoycrf> lil animation
[09:05:09] <enjoycrf> u can do it w settimeout

[09:07:30] <kborchers> Pet^Aw: first thing, don't use async: false, second don't use alert to debug see ?alert
[09:07:30] <enjoycrf> <lacrymology> look up animating text with javascript
[09:07:31] <bot-t> Pet^Aw, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[09:07:35] <krz> ok nvm got it
[09:08:19] <enjoycrf> u just use the settimeout funciton and flip thru ur frames of dots
[09:08:30] <enjoycrf> super easy
[09:10:18] <kborchers> Pet^Aw: you're also not preventing the default submit action on your form so your page is going to refresh when it does it's post. other than that, i think without a working site to see the error, it's going to be hard to help you
[09:11:33] <Pet^Aw> kborchers, if i dont'use async: false i obtain the error "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"
[09:12:29] <jonee> hello. how do you validate a file upload? i am using jquery.validate
[09:13:48] <kborchers> Pet^Aw: I have no idea what that error is but async: false == you're doing it wrong. that locks the browser and makes things seem broken
[09:14:02] <geekbuntu> jonee, usually you use yoru language or framework to do that
[09:14:17] <geekbuntu> jonee, if it's PHP - use php to verify value/size attributes
[09:24:18] <jankidudel> hi, what's wrong here  ? http://pastebin.com/pGcsRFuY   , when I mouseover img then infobox appears, but mouseout  doesn't  hides it  http://pastebin.com/pGcsRFuY
[09:24:22] <theCode> how do you prevent a draggable parent from hijacking it's children's draggability?
[09:26:33] <enjoycrf> e.preventDefault?
[09:26:40] <kborchers> theCode: off the top of my head you could either give all of the draggables handles or you could prevent the mousedown events from bubbling up from the children to the parent
[09:28:09] <jankidudel> * i mean when hovering image too fast, then on mouseout  info box doesn't dissapears
[09:35:25] <sadmicrowave> hey guys I need some help creating my own ellipsis plugin (there are others out there but I find them too cumbersome) I've made mine very minimalistic but just can't get the ellipsis placement right. It should be placing it in the bottom right corner of the parent div (outlined in black) but it is appending it to the bottom of the div below the innerHTML content. http://jsfiddle.net/ngRhM/
[09:36:26] <aro> are there any plugins that will create a 'wizard step indicator' type image?
[09:40:59] <Kaapa> Can anyone explain me why I can't use the join function in http://jsfiddle.net/kCPVn/2/ ?

[09:44:02] <pachet> sadmicrowave: http://jsfiddle.net/yYp4M/
[09:45:09] <sadmicrowave> pachet, what is that supposed to do? I don't see an ellipsis at all now, and all the content is within the parent (red outlined) container
[09:46:31] <pachet> sadmicrowave: hm? i see all the text overflowing the black container (#test) but the ellipsis is in the right spot, on my fiddle at least

[09:48:21] <sadmicrowave> pachet, what exactly did you add, aside from the div{border:1px solid #F00; (malformed by the way, fixed here: http://jsfiddle.net/yYp4M/1/) in the css portion
[09:49:27] <sadmicrowave> pachet, this is what I see: http://imgur.com/v4lwf
[09:49:58] <pachet> sadmicrowave: fiddlefutz? try this one (reupdated) http://jsfiddle.net/yYp4M/2/
[09:50:12] <pachet> you were appending the new ellipsis div to parent
[09:51:02] <pachet> er, body rather
[09:51:08] <pachet> but maybe thats what you wanted? 1sec if so
[09:52:13] <kitikonti> why this dont work $('a[href="#earring-3"]').index(); i always get -1
[09:52:57] <sadmicrowave> pachet, I just wanted it to work, you got it working...but I'm trying to figure out how making the bottom = '...'.height and right = '...'.width actually ends up putting it in the right spot...thats weird
[09:54:24] <pachet> sadmicrowave: its because its positioned relative to the parent
[09:54:42] <pachet> so you're saying, i want this to be iparamH from the bottom of the parent element (#test)
[09:55:58] <sadmicrowave> gotcha
[09:57:42] <jvdev> when I use appendTo in $.autocomplete, none of my events fire(focus, select, etc). I'm appending to an object that's created by extending _renderMenu's prototype.
[09:58:18] <sadmicrowave> Kaapa, I've never used the .map function before but it seems that was your problem, it wasn't putting the elements in array form which is what .join needs to work...so here: http://imgur.com/v4lwf
[09:59:45] <Kaapa> sadmicrowave: map should return an array, but thanks anyway
[09:59:46] <Kaapa> need to look
[10:00:57] <enjoycrf> yeah dood
[10:01:02] <jvdev> my autocomplete looks like this…in coffeescript http://pastie.org/2455321
[10:01:23] <pachet> sadmicrowave: here's another, more in keeping with what you had originally: http://jsfiddle.net/yYp4M/6/
[10:01:30] <jvdev> i want to appendTo ".autocomplete-inner-wrap" so that there's a top tooltip
[10:01:57] <sadmicrowave> pachet, yea I'd rather make it relative if possible so thanks
[10:03:34] <jvdev> anyone had experience appending to an element within your ul?
[10:04:12] <Toidi> How can I get the div container from $("#container").myPlugin(); in my plugin?
[10:04:46] <Cork[home]> Toidi: should be this.element
[10:05:22] <Cork[home]> jvdev: if thats a question, just ask the question
[10:06:18] <Toidi> Cork[home], It says undefined when using console.log(this.element);
[10:06:48] <Cork[home]> Toidi: is it a jquery plugin or a jquery-ui one?
[10:06:59] <Toidi> jQuery
[10:07:46] <jvdev> how can i get events to fire if i'm appending to an element within my ul.ui-autocomplete?
[10:10:02] <Cork[home]> Toidi: one min... my comp just crashed on me :s
[10:11:28] <Cork[home]> Toidi: ok for jquery plugins this should be the selected elements
[10:11:41] <Cork[home]> this.element is jquery-ui
[10:12:50] <Guest29973> Anyone have a some spare time?
[10:13:22] <lahue> Anyone alive?
[10:13:38] <Toidi> Cork[home], That's what I though. Any ideas why it's undefined
[10:13:42] <Toidi> thought*
[10:13:49] <inad922> Can someone tell me why can't I do something like $.post('/some_address/', { id: variable }, function(data) {....}); I don't get anything in the post dictionary on the other side..
[10:13:59] <kborchers> Kaapa: i believe that map is not returning an array but an object that acts like an array. try this http://jsfiddle.net/kCPVn/5/
[10:14:17] <lahue> I'm trying to solve http://forum.jquery.com/topic/featured-content-slider-question any suggestions?
[10:14:49] <Cork[home]> Toidi: you might try to use this inside another callback that sets it to something else
[10:15:17] <Cork[home]> inad922: from that context it should work
[10:15:35] <Cork[home]> ?ask @ lahue
[10:15:35] <bot-t> lahue, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:16:05] <lahue> Thank you, I am currently working with http://webdeveloperplus.com/jquery/featured-content-slider-using-jquery-ui/ and I am using all of the same tags, class, etc. I am trying to add code using jQuery/Javascript so that if the image is active/displayed the thumbnail corresponding to it is changed. Example: The first image is active, therefore the thumbnail image should become ThumbnailOver.jpg
[10:17:10] <lahue> I'm hoping to to use the show event of the tabs and then the use of jQuery to change the image.
[10:18:22] <Kaapa> kborchers: wow - never seen that makeArray before - will look, thanks
[10:18:53] <r1ch> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7247162/jquery-ajax-call-preventing-jquery-ui-combobox-select-firing-permalink
[10:18:57] <kborchers> Kaapa: fyi, it's mentioned in the map docs see ?map
[10:18:58] <bot-t> Kaapa, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[10:19:00] <Kaapa> kborchers: actually - the makearray documentation explains the problem
[10:19:08] <ajpiano> kborchers: Kaapa just use $("p").map(fn).get()
[10:19:12] <ajpiano> no need to use makearray
[10:19:13] <Kaapa> "any methods, both in jQuery and in JavaScript in general, return objects that are array-like. For example, the jQuery factory function $() returns a jQuery object that has many of the properties of an array (a length, the [] array access operator, etc.), but is not exactly the same as an array and lacks some of an array's built-in methods (such as .pop() and .reverse())."
[10:19:36] <Toidi> Cork[home], I clone this into a local variable with my plugin name, but that is about it
[10:19:56] <Kaapa> ajpiano: what I really wanted was to understand what was going on
[10:19:58] <Kaapa> thanks everyone!
[10:20:02] <ajpiano> Kaapa: cool
[10:20:26] <ThePendulum> Back
[10:20:37] <Cork[home]> ?p @ Toidi
[10:20:38] <bot-t> Toidi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:20:56] <ThePendulum> Anyone already solved why I can't use numeric values to define the speed of animations? :\
[10:21:58] <ThePendulum> brb
[10:22:21] <kborchers> ajpiano: i don't use map much, if at all, but it seems like the docs should be updated since they say an array is returned by map but you have to use get to pull the elements out into an array ... or am i missing something?
[10:22:29] <pachet> ThePendulum: in your animate params, you arent quoting the speed value, right?
[10:26:02] <Toidi> Cork[home], http://jsfiddle.net/Be9Re/
[10:26:28] <flayks> hi there
[10:26:53] <ajpiano> kborchers: on $.map or $.fn.map
[10:26:57] <ajpiano> ?
[10:27:07] <flayks> why the animate({width:min}, 200} take all min values in this code when you click on "-" in the box ? http://jsfiddle.net/y4dqT/
[10:27:45] <ajpiano> ThePendulum: update your demo page to actually use a number so we can see it failing
[10:28:32] <kborchers> ajpiano: that was my mistake ... helps to read the correct doc :/
[10:28:37] <ajpiano> :)
[10:28:37] * kborchers hides in a dark corner
[10:32:01] <Toidi> Cork[home], Any ideas?
[10:33:02] <draginx> Is anyone here good with jquery-ui more specifically draggable and droppable?
[10:33:54] <kborchers> ?ask @ draginx
[10:33:54] <bot-t> draginx, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:35:51] <lahue> http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/ I need to add a script to change the thumbnail image if corresponding large image is active
[10:36:01] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/MWcVe/ essentially I want to be able to drag the images on the bottom there towards the top, once thats done iw ant to change its draggable options to a different criteria… for some reason jquery-ui does not change this… it just kind of reverts to its old self
[10:36:32] <ThePendulum> pachet: I tried both quoting and not quoting them, which made no significant difference
[10:37:10] <ThePendulum> pachet: Wait a minute, it works now. I wonder what I did wrong
[10:37:16] <ThePendulum> Thanks for your support anyway! :)
[10:38:21] <draginx> nvm solved my problem
[10:38:33] <pachet> ThePendulum: no sweat! serendipitous success!
[10:39:28] <ThePendulum> :D
[10:39:39] <ThePendulum> Next issue
[10:39:40] <ThePendulum> lol
[10:40:03] <ThePendulum> http://94.228.211.26 <-- what would be the best ways to make the reddish color on the menu's when hovering them fade in and out, in jquery ofcourse?
[10:40:49] <ajpiano> add the color plugin and animate background-color on hover?
[10:41:00] <ThePendulum> color plugin?
[10:41:16] <jonclark> ?g jquery color plugin
[10:41:17] <ajpiano> https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-color/master/jquery.color.js
[10:41:17] <bot-t> jonclark, Color Animations | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[10:41:18] <lahue> Could u use http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[10:41:51] <ThePendulum> Woosh thanks for all the links guys
[10:42:17] <ThePendulum> Another more personal question though, would you prefer a quick fading on the menu's or do you think they're just fine like this?
[10:42:51] <lahue> Im thinking it is fine as is.
[10:43:06] <ajpiano> i would leave it as is in JS and use a CSS transition to enhance where those are available ;)
[10:43:50] <ribot> hey
[10:43:55] <ThePendulum> hi
[10:44:39] <ribot> if this code "$("a").click(function()" accesses all links, how can i change this code to access all links of the class "red" ?
[10:44:54] <ajpiano> $("a.red")
[10:44:54] <pachet> $('a .red')
[10:45:02] <pachet> jynx
[10:45:04] <pachet> you owe me a coke
[10:45:09] <ajpiano> jinx only works if you say the same thing
[10:45:11] <ajpiano> ...
[10:45:19] <ribot> thanks
[10:45:22] <pachet> er.
[10:45:36] <pachet> -' '
[10:47:47] <lahue> Did anyone happen to have any suggestions on http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/
[10:49:17] <ThePendulum> What are you trying to do, lahue?
[10:49:44] <lahue> Simply put, if the image is selected/active have the thumbnail change to a new image.
[10:49:56] <lahue> Once it rotates to the next image, change the thumbnail back and set the new one.
[10:50:19] <draginx> Whats the best way to see if the URL path contains ^/#!/ ?
[10:50:26] <obsd123> can anyone tell me why $($data).filter(':header') works but $(':header', $data) doesn't?  I thought the two were functionally equivalent
[10:50:29] <ThePendulum> Hmm I'm afraid I've got to pass that one to someone else in here :\
[10:50:42] <lahue> Hah, I think everyone has been doing that ;)
[10:50:54] <lahue> I'm unable to find an answer from anyone, even the author of it
[10:50:54] <ThePendulum> Hmpf.
[10:51:09] <ThePendulum> Well I'm using jQuery for just 2 days lol
[10:51:29] <lahue> lol for the most part I am in the same boat ;)
[10:51:32] <draginx> lahue: what does it currently do? O-o
[10:51:40] <draginx> doesnt change the image?
[10:52:02] <ajpiano> lahue: use the events that tabs triggers, like show and hide, etc
[10:52:07] <ajpiano> and react when those things happen
[10:52:08] <lahue> Here is a working demo here http://demo.webdeveloperplus.com/featured-content-slider/
[10:52:29] <draginx> it works here O_o
[10:52:49] <lahue> So if it starts on the car, the thumbnail would change to lets say a image of a blue car.
[10:53:09] <lahue> ajpiano I tried to do that, but I could not get any code combination to work
[10:53:40] <ajpiano> ah yes, code combinations
[10:54:04] <ThePendulum> I guess transitions are CSS3 aren't they?
[10:54:08] <ajpiano> yep
[10:54:08] <lahue> I found: Supply a callback function to handle the show event as an init option. $( ".selector" ).tabs({    show: function(event, ui) { ... } }); Bind to the show event by type: tabsshow. $( ".selector" ).bind( "tabsshow", function(event, ui) {   ... });
[10:54:17] <ajpiano> yes
[10:54:20] <ajpiano> you do stuff in there
[10:54:29] <ajpiano> like look at the ui argument
[10:54:33] <lahue> , but I don't know how to use that to change the image
[10:55:22] <ribot> so now when $("a").click(function() affects any link, i want the href of the clicked link, is it $this.href ?
[10:55:23] <ajpiano> var someimg = $("#yourimg");  $("#foo").tabs({ show: function(e, ui) {  someimg.attr("src", "something.else.jpg"); });
[10:56:10] <lahue> now how can I use that for five seperate images :p
[10:56:56] <ajpiano> critical thinking
[10:57:11] <lahue> Yup I've been going at it for days now.
[10:57:37] <lahue> What makes it more difficult is that I am using CF to dynamically change the images
[10:58:57] <Xeon06_> Does anyone know how to execute multiple lines of code in a template?
[10:59:54] <lahue> Anyone know of good online jQuery communities?
[11:00:21] <ajpiano> you're in one :x
[11:00:41] <lahue> Well I know, but something where I can completely post my problem and see if I can't get a response
[11:01:12] <pachet> stackoverflow
[11:01:17] <ajpiano> lahue: are you saying that when yoou hover over the <img> inside of each li>a, you want that image to be the main tab
[11:01:59] <lahue> I tried stackoverflow, I'm saying when a thumbnail is active (meaning its large image is displayed) I want the thumbnail image to change
[11:02:17] <lahue> I don't want it to change on hover, IFF image is active, then change thumbnail image
[11:02:50] <pachet> obsd123: perhaps see the 3rd answer at : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/405409/use-jquery-selectors-on-ajax-loaded-html
[11:03:46] <ribot> i'm trying to update an iframe's src to a clicked link's href, but why doesn't this code work: http://pastie.org/private/hlp7kdeutlcv8ngh6chca
[11:03:49] <ajpiano> do some dom traversal inside of ui.tab on the show event and change the img src that you find
[11:03:50] <lahue> There are 5 thumbnail, each with a different picture.  The image has an id of fragment-1 and so on
[11:04:26] <lahue> lol would you happen to have some sample code for that?
[11:04:39] <ribot> if this.attr("href") is the href of the clicked link it would work
[11:06:21] <lahue> I also found:   down vote    $('img.over').each(function(){      var t=$(this);      var src1= t.attr('src'); // initial src      var newSrc = src1.substring(0, src1.lastIndexOf('.'));; // let's get file name without extension      t.hover(function(){          $(this).attr('src', newSrc+ '-over.' + /[^.]+$/.exec(src1)); //last part is for extension         }, function(){          $(this).attr('src', newSrc + '.' + /[^.]+$/.exec(src1)); //removing '-over'
[11:06:38] <xec> my eyes
[11:07:06] <lahue> Sorry ;) i added it to http://jsfiddle.net/Wu3g8/2/
[11:07:48] <lahue> It looks like it would work, but I need it use it in the show function and remove the hover
[11:09:30] <pachet> ribot: http://pastie.org/2455619
[11:09:42] <aro> are there any plugins that will create a 'wizard step indicator' type image?
[11:10:43] <enjoycrf> huh
[11:10:49] <enjoycrf> dam these admins
[11:10:50] <enjoycrf> wtf
[11:10:53] <inad922> Is there a way to insert elements into the dom structure but don't display them?
[11:11:36] <tystr> hide()
[11:22:18] <inad922> If I'm inserting something from an Ajax request with $(...).after(...) with a style of 'display: none; ' why can't I use slideIn() on the inserted element? Doesn't it see that in that iteration of the javascript? Can I commit the changes somehow?
[11:25:33] <Brodingo> inad922 slideIn?
[11:25:51] <inad922> slideDown
[11:25:53] <inad922> sorry
[11:26:26] <srj555> I have a dashboard with a bunch of iframes and was wondering if there are any cool query plugins that allow a user to dock the iframes, resize, etc... similar to a bunch of windows, except maybe not allowed to float... sorry, don't have any examples of this..
[11:26:35] <inad922> but I insert an element with .after(); and a style of display: none; and I can't slideDown it after
[11:26:46] <Brodingo> are you selecting it?
[11:27:07] <inad922> yeah with $('#id_of_element').slideDown()
[11:27:09] <inad922> ;
[11:27:31] <inad922> seems like it cannot make 2 animations in 1 function
[11:27:35] <inad922> for the same element
[11:28:29] <inad922> is there somekind of make_animations_and_wait_till_its_finished function in jquery?
[11:28:45] <inad922> or how can I insert an element into the document with a slideDown?
[11:29:28] <Brodingo> you probably need insertAfter().slideDown()
[11:30:14] <inad922> but than I would slide down the element which is already visible and before the element currently inserted not?
[11:33:04] <Brodingo> .insertAfter().hide().slideDown()
[11:35:14] <Dave-Stein> `var Obj = function(){}; var X = new Obj();` will `X = null` properly clear memory?
[11:35:25] <Dave-Stein> sure it's not jquery question but everyone here is good with JS :)
[11:36:15] <bencc> is there an eta for the jqueryui grid?
[11:36:58] <srj555> bencc: use slickgrid
[11:39:46] <bencc> srj555: look nice. The only feature I"m missing is header filters
[11:40:23] <codeisforeva> if i have an object with properties assigned values with .val() .. what's the best way to go about refreshing the property values?
[11:40:33] <srj555> bencc:  http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example-header-row.html
[11:41:06] <srj555> bencc: it's pretty slick.
[11:41:07] <bencc> srj555: does this support remote sorting?
[11:41:19] <bencc> srj555: I'm looking for something like extjs grid
[11:41:24] <srj555> bencc: dunno
[11:41:57] <bencc> thanks
[11:53:56] <Moo^_^> is $.extend shallow or deep copy?
[11:54:25] <Iarfen> Hi
[11:54:40] <Iarfen> How I can execute a function each time the (document) changes their height?
[11:59:57] <pachet> Iarfen: there's a DOMSubtreeModified event
[12:00:11] <Iarfen> pachet: what's it?
[12:00:12] <pachet> but it will be clunky
[12:00:25] <pachet> it fires every time the dom changes....
[12:00:44] <pachet> better to bind to the events that would cause the document to change size
[12:01:33] <Iarfen> pachet: I don't worry about that, tell me what's that event please. the function es very simple :D
[12:03:32] <kborchers> pachet, Iarfen: i don't think that event is supported by IE
[12:03:48] <Iarfen> kborchers: Me I don't worry about IE xDD
[12:04:06] <Iarfen> kborchers: only IE 8 or more, the others IE for me aren't important
[12:04:36] <kborchers> I don't think any IE support it, don't think Opera either but can't test that one
[12:04:47] <pachet> $.bind('DOMSubtreeModified', function(){alert("this is going to slow down my browser");});
[12:06:37] <Iarfen> pachet: ok ty
[12:07:56] <Iarfen> pachet: it doesn't work, I put it on (document).ready but it doesn't do anything
[12:09:17] <zephir> hi guys

[12:17:41] <sean`> omg
[12:17:47] <sean`> It's broken
[12:22:58] <shoelessone> How about this: Does anybody know of a good irc channel for general web/server questions?
[12:24:16] <ravenzz> #web ?
[12:25:01] <ravenzz> which kind of server are you interested on?
[12:25:09] <kitikonti> how could i check if a jquery plugin is availible in my document?
[12:25:55] <shoelessone> kitikonti: you can always just do something like $(function(){ alert("HI"); });
[12:26:16] <shoelessone> ravenzz: well, I am trying to change some DNS settings, but coudl use some pro-tips
[12:26:56] <enjoycrf> DNS?
[12:26:58] <enjoycrf> wats up
[12:27:14] <ravenzz> shoelessone #bind
[12:27:14] <ravenzz> ?
[12:27:25] <kitikonti> shoelessone: but how could i check if the swipe plugin is availible to use in my document?
[12:27:36] <shoelessone> kitikonti: sorry, I missunderstood
[12:27:46] <pachet> kitikonti: assuming swipe is also the name of a method in the plugin, you could do if(jQuery().swipe)
[12:27:56] <shoelessone> enjoycrf: well, I have a bunch of domains and websites that use EveryDNS for a DNS server, but everydns is going away, so I'm trying to switch things over to GoDaddy's DNS
[12:27:58] <pachet> will return true if it's loaded
[12:28:39] <kitikonti> pachet: thx exactly what i am seraching for

[12:32:18] <_numbers> anyone know how spine framework works
[12:32:24] <bsock> hey folks
[12:32:44] <bsock> working with the new-ish ajax promise objects, having an issue finding the mimetype on the ajaxError method
[12:32:49] <_numbers> im trying to get the Spine.Controller  event: { 'event .element' } working
[12:32:59] <bsock> since it doesn't seem to parse the json i'm returning
[12:34:07] <eddiemonge> bsock: it doesnt parse returned json because its an error. see http://api.jquery.com/ajaxerror/
[12:34:50] <bsock> eddiemonge: but the response is valid json, i know i can eval it, but i'd like to limit the eval to when it is actually an application/json request
[12:34:53] <bsock> and i can't find that one
[12:35:06] <bsock> i'm trying to use the method to push an error message into my interface
[12:35:17] <DevBrPb> how to apply the same function in two elements
[12:35:20] <bsock> and i'd like to get at least something other than "an error has occurred"
[12:35:25] <DevBrPb> i use the bind?
[12:35:32] <enjoycrf> check out my game lol
[12:35:35] <enjoycrf> http://www.7r4c3.net -> click logo
[12:35:48] <DevBrPb> or i can for     $j(".btn_comentar", ".btn_add_comentario").click(function () {
[12:36:05] <eddiemonge> bsock: than return it as 200 with the response and in the json add something like status: error and then parse that in your success callback
[12:36:13] <DevBrPb> like a array to not duplicate the function
[12:36:57] <eddiemonge> DevBrPb: name your function and then pass in the name to .click()
[12:37:05] <bsock> eddiemonge: that seems like way more of a hack than what i'm trying to do. it is *supposed* to be a 500 error, but i'm returning json for ajax 500 in my app. is there no way to get at the mime type in the ajaxerror methods?
[12:37:07] <madprops> how can I select all the text inside a <code> tag? I tried $('#codetagid').select() but nah
[12:37:14] <Ricoshady> im using the forms plugin to do dynamic uploads, and to enable a progress bar. I'm getting a select few users that report a problem with 'fakepath' errors showing up... It seems to be related to browser security settings. Anyone with similar issues?
[12:39:09] <beans> hey quick question. i'm using http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-resize/examples/resize/ to help resize iframes and it's working great since everything is on the same domain
[12:39:32] <beans> the iframe can shrink and grow on firefox / ie7 8 9 but on chrome and safari (webkit)
[12:39:35] <beans> it doesn't work
[12:40:01] <beans> for some reason within the iframe when the content changes height the body tag only changes when the content grows and not when it shrinks
[12:40:17] <beans> if you go the page itself (src of hte iframe) the body grows and shrinks accordingly
[12:40:19] <beans> any ideas?
[12:40:20] <eddiemonge> bsock: error 500 means there was a server error. if you your request isnt throwing an actual HTTP Response error then it means the ajax was successful. if your app itself has an error then it should be treated in the ajaxsuccess
[12:40:34] <eddiemonge> Ricoshady: .text()
[12:41:54] <bsock> eddiemonge: that's counter intuitive... it seems like i would have to have error handling code in every ajax success callback...
[12:42:01] <bsock> from the way you're describing it
[12:42:50] <orolo> hi. i'm looking for something like :contains but matches exactly. so $('div').text() is equal to foobar.
[12:42:51] <eddiemonge> bsock: you are looking at it wrong. you are looking at ajax requests being requests in your app instead of what they are, requests to a server and its response
[12:43:15] <eddiemonge> bsock: where i think you are more looking at application logic errors and success like user validation or action validation
[12:43:39] <eddiemonge> orolo: $('div').text() === 'whatever'
[12:43:48] <orolo> eddiemonge: ok. thanks.
[12:44:56] <bsock> eddiemonge: every other REST app i've interacted with has returned application errors as 500's, it seems strange that they'd all be wrong
[12:47:05] <eddiemonge> bsock: and yet they are.
[12:47:42] <bsock> eddiemonge: so you're saying i have to check for the existence of my error fields in every ajax call i make, rather than centralizing the error handling in a single place?
[12:48:22] <eddiemonge> bsock: you can do the samething in ajaxsuccess. or in ajaxerror have standard process for each returned status
[12:48:36] <eddiemonge> if the server returns an error of 500, it should not be returning content
[12:48:56] <eddiemonge> the only thing that should be returning content is 200 and some 300 level responses
[12:49:12] <snover> eh?
[12:49:15] <bsock> eddiemonge: that really seems like a matter of interpretation
[12:49:23] <Ricoshady> eddiemonge, what do you mean .text()
[12:50:10] <eddiemonge> ? text @ Ricoshady
[12:50:10] <bot-t> Ricoshady, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[12:50:23] <snover> server can return content with anything except 1xx and 204
[12:51:26] <bsock> an application error seems exactly the sort of thing that would fall under a 500
[12:51:33] <Ricoshady> eddiemonge, ok, but where did that come from? that fixes the fakepath issue?
[12:51:43] <Ricoshady> i dont understand what .text() will do for me
[12:52:07] <eddiemonge> Ricoshady: oh sorry, that was for madprops
[12:52:11] <ajpiano> 500 means like, shit got broken, uncaught exception on server... NOT application error...
[12:54:43] <Ricoshady> anyone see errors with JQuery form plugins, and IE security issues that display "fakepath"
[12:57:44] <webBuilder> hello brothers I have an auto complete that I found on the tutorial http://www.devbridge.com/projects/autocomplete/jquery/    the only problem I'm facing is I have ../snippets/getdata.jsp that will get the data out of the Db but I do not know how to pass the parameter to that jsp page any help ?
[12:57:51] <webBuilder> my code is http://pastebin.com/hvQgV9v9
[12:58:23] <kayT3> I have a question when trying to automate bindings with jquery. http://pastebin.com/tKEB4y8y for some reason my binding is acting wierd, as if the first member is binding to all the members in the keyUpMap. Each keyUpMap member is a jQuery reference made by keyUpMap["someindex"] = $(someselector);
[12:59:15] <bsock> ok, so if i give up the ajaxError method i've been attempting, rebuild the system to return some 200 error code, how would i keep the *actual* success handler from firing?
[12:59:28] <kayT3> can I not access an object properly with two indexes deep when going from the object[member][member's member] ?
[12:59:30] <bsock> rather, 200 respoonse code
[13:00:08] <lduros> is it ok to use $(document).ready(function(){ something here }); before the jquery.js is actually loaded?
[13:00:30] <webBuilder> wow more questions than answer in here :)
[13:00:34] <eddiemonge> bsock: if you get ajaxsuccess it means the ajax completed successfully so use json to represent application success or error
[13:00:54] <Brodingo> lduros no because jquery wont be defined
[13:01:15] <eddiemonge> kayT3: you mean like object.member.name?
[13:01:25] <Ankabout> hi, I need some help making a "scrolling" effect.
[13:01:25] <bsock> eddiemonge: but i'm using the json to represent the data i'm trying to get back, if i change the error code, it seems like i would have to check for "errorcode" and "message" existence in every success handler
[13:01:37] <Ankabout> This is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/fpwqZ/
[13:01:39] <bsock> basicaly, i want unified error handling and granular success ahndling
[13:02:14] <webBuilder> Mmm.. so how can do the autocomplete jquery to send the parameter to that specific jsp file
[13:02:45] <bsock> and if in my global success hander i find that its actually an error, how would i keep the granular success handler from firing?
[13:03:01] <eddiemonge> bsock: json can hold a lot and can do lots of different structures. if response.success then response.otherObjectTypeDataHere
[13:03:21] <eddiemonge> webBuilder: look at the official jqueryui.com examples. they are pretty helpful
[13:03:35] <kayT3> eddiemonge I mean like accessing an object in array syntax so I can use hasOwnProperty and for/in to get the 'names' of this's members and then loop through them as get the member's member
[13:03:37] <bsock> this still doesn't solve my problem of forcing me to do that in *every* ajax call, it seems tedious and unnecessary to duplicate the error check
[13:03:38] <Baribal> Hi. This is probably rather noobish, but anyways: I *expected* this code to create an alert when the select element throws an onChange event. What actually happens is... nothing. What am I doing wrong? http://paste2.org/p/1619308
[13:04:05] <webBuilder> eddiemonge, thank you for your replay then I'll go and look there then
[13:04:17] <bsock> i'm really trying to avoid having to prefix every success handler with the error check
[13:05:24] <enjoycrf> omfg
[13:06:09] <eddiemonge> bsock: add rudimentary error handling in the global ajaxsuccess callback.
[13:06:18] <kborchers> Baribal: you are trying to bind before the dom is ready which means your select doesn't exist yet. wrap your bind in $(document).ready(function() { ... }); and you're good to go. oh, and the event is change, not onChange
[13:06:29] <bsock> eddiemonge: how would i keep the remaining handlers from firing?
[13:06:54] <eddiemonge> Baribal: look into .change() and you need all that in a .ready() block
[13:07:00] <BiziCold> Hello everyone, I'am trying to, develop an app the show's the input that a user revices from skype/facebook/MSN msennger to my app, I was woundering if someone can give me some info about that
[13:07:06] <eddiemonge> lol kborchers you beat me
[13:07:18] <eddiemonge> bsock: return false?
[13:07:35] <webBuilder> eddiemonge,  well your link it does the same thing. my question is how can I can pass the letter to the page that will provide me to make the autocomplete
[13:07:38] <Baribal> Thank you.
[13:07:38] <bsock> eddiemonge: ah fuck, ok, i'm derpin, thaks man
[13:07:40] <webBuilder> any help on that
[13:07:42] <kayT3> ediemonge http://pastebin.com/CUVm0Rch that may explain it a bit more
[13:08:20] <kborchers> Baribal: also, you should move on up to 1.6.2 instead of 1.5
[13:08:30] <Baribal> Actually, do you know of a JavaScript tutorial that deals with binding order, scopes and the like? All those that I could find are directed towards non-programmers.
[13:09:24] <kayT3> @baribal http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getoutbindingsituations
[13:09:26] <bsock> BiziCold: you're probably going to have to integrate the messenger services on the server side to do that, unless other people know more about those
[13:10:38] <BiziCold> bsock: do yoknow where can i find some info about that?
[13:10:53] <bsock> BiziCold: i dunno, try the pidgin developers chat room
[13:10:56] <Ankabout> anyone know how I can accomplish my scrolling thing?
[13:11:53] <BiziCold> bsock: sorry for the ignorance but whats pdgin developers chat room?
[13:12:11] <bsock> BiziCold: don't know. go to the pidgin website.
[13:12:37] <lduros> Brodingo: so it would have to come after loading jquery?
[13:13:10] <Brodingo> yes because anytime before that $ is not a function

[13:14:27] <Baribal> You should see #python, they're redirecting people every 15 minutes or so.

[13:20:56] <Baribal> Brodingo, that'd be ##python. :)
[13:21:13] <TheEmpath> i would like to have a DraggableFactory that when I click on it, it creates a new Draggable on the fly.  I'm having a problem of "transfering" the mousedown event from the factory to the newly created draggable.  I've tried delegate but it didn't work, and I'm trying trigger, but it ends up creating thousands of new draggables each time i click on the draggable factory...
[13:21:29] <TheEmpath> im banned form python lol
[13:22:45] <enjoycrf> dood irc is full of wackjobs
[13:22:48] <pachet> TheEmpath: can't you just do $('.draggable-item').live("mousedown", function(){$(this).draggable();});
[13:23:00] <pachet> irrespective of the draggable factory whatsit
[13:23:46] <madprops> so i made this paste bin site if anybody wants to use it www.radpaste.com
[13:24:09] <pachet> does it default to mootools ;[
[13:24:38] <bsock> why do the ajaxSuccess and ajaxError messages not return parsed json...
[13:24:56] <TheEmpath> pachet: that will turn the factory into a draggable.  i need the factory to stay put while creating new draggables

[13:26:37] <BillCriswell> With grease monkey, would I be able to write a script or something to populate a bunch of inputs with some local files to upload?
[13:26:47] <kborchers> TheEmpath: you should be able to use trigger. what is probably happening is if your new draggable is created as a child of the factory, the click is bubbling up to the factory causing a loop. try creating the new draggable elsewhere in the document and place it under the mouse, then trigger mousedown on the new element and see if that helps
[13:26:56] <BillCriswell> I know this isn't greastmonkey but I figured you guys would know
[13:27:27] <pachet> TheEmpath: oh gotcha, misunderstood. you want to preserve the mousedown---^^

[13:29:33] <mykul> ask away bro
[13:29:35] <mykul> er
[13:29:39] <gabrielc> simple question how do I select  one of the two anchors where rel 1 and 2 <a class ="ctrls" rel =1 >  <a class ="ctrls" rel =2 > tried variations of $('.ctrls').attr(rel=1)
[13:29:52] <gabrielc> thanks ..

[13:30:34] <WTI\michaelr> anyone have an answer to my question?  If the answer is no, that's all good, I'll just have to build it
[13:30:37] <gabrielc> oh ok  ..  thanks very much
[13:30:53] <WTI\michaelr> I just don't want to recreate something that already exists :)
[13:31:23] <Dave-Stein> WTI\michaelr i haven't seen it but maybe google has
[13:31:59] <TheEmpath> kborchers: Ahh.. make the draggable a sibling of the draggablefactory, not a child, so that the bubbling up doesn't cause a loop
[13:32:05] <WTI\michaelr> it's possible your google-fu is greater than mine, but I can't think of any combination of keywords that isn't going to pull up the normal ajaxy stuff
[13:32:16] <WTI\michaelr> I tried, but if you have any suggestions, I'm willing to try them
[13:32:24] <TheEmpath> kborchers: that's better than removing the mousedown event on the factory while the draggable is in existance
[13:32:25] <Dave-Stein> nonjquery question: I have an app that doesn't refresh page. I have several different "pages." For markup I want to come down via AJAX, do you think I should cache in the client for later? or have user redownload when coming back to page later?
[13:32:30] <TheEmpath> kborchers: I'll give that a whirl
[13:32:37] <kborchers> TheEmpath: yeah, that would be my suggestion ... without seeing your code
[13:32:43] <TheEmpath> tis a good one
[13:32:49] <Dave-Stein> im thinking redownload later to avoid having an infinite amount of HTML cached in browser
[13:32:49] <TheEmpath> +1 beer kborchers
[13:33:16] <WTI\michaelr> I wouldn't cache either until it becomes apparent that it's needed.
[13:33:36] <WTI\michaelr> avoid the complexity of custom cache  as long as you can.
[13:33:50] <Dave-Stein> yeah it would be nice if coming back later wouldnt have that delay of download but i don't think it's a big deal in long run
[13:34:20] <WTI\michaelr> you know your requirements better than I do, that's just my initial gut reaction.
[13:34:25] <Dave-Stein> caus the only HTML i pass through server is markup that isn't part of a template
[13:34:33] <Dave-Stein> yeah
[13:34:45] <gabrielc> yep ..  great works like a charm .. :-) @ Dave-Stein thanks !!

[13:35:10] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with scrolling elements within each other?
[13:48:43] <cobar> which event should i use to watch an input text box as the person is typing in it?
[13:49:49] <webBuilder> how can I attached to my getdata.jsp page a parameter in jQuery the code is here http://pastebin.com/hvQgV9v9   it's an autocomplete but I need to pass each letter that the user is typing
[13:50:07] <webBuilder> to the server
[13:50:12] <webBuilder> and I do not know how to do it
[13:56:23] <webBuilder> wow one at a time please do not answer all at once :P
[13:57:16] <cobar> i think there is an autocomplete plugin that you might be able to use as inspiration
[13:59:07] <chronos> hello people. With $("table > tbody > tr:last") I can get last row of a table, but exist a simple way to get previous row to the last row?
[14:00:25] <kborchers> chronos: $("table > tbody > tr:last").prev();

[14:00:39] <chronos> prev
[14:00:41] <chronos> thx

[14:03:19] <bsock> ok, so i'm still having serious issues figuring out how to implement a single point of error handling for general ajax exceptions...
[14:03:41] <bsock> the way that eddimonge was telling me earlier just doesn't work
[14:04:02] <webBuilder> thank you kborchers and bot-t but stil when I see the source code it does this var availableTags = [

[14:04:02] <webBuilder> 			"AppleScript",
[14:04:02] <webBuilder> 			"Asp",
[14:04:02] <webBuilder> 			"BASIC",
[14:04:04] <bsock> i can't cause the global ajax success handler to stop propagation of the success event to the other registered handlers
[14:04:09] <ajpiano> bsock: $.ajaxPrefilter( function(options) { options.error = function(xhr) {  //do stuff };   });

[14:04:52] <webBuilder> okay
[14:04:52] <pdclark> Is there any way to programmatically add & remove handles on a jquery.ui.slider?
[14:04:53] <webBuilder> sorry
[14:05:02] <kborchers> too bad bot-t.com has been down for a while now
[14:05:07] <Dave-Stein> lol
[14:05:26] <Dave-Stein> pdclark you cando $('#slider').slider( 'option', 'handles', 'new-selector')
[14:05:29] <Dave-Stein> or whatever it is
[14:05:33] <Dave-Stein> i think handles is the option name
[14:05:42] <Dave-Stein> check the doc
[14:05:53] <pdclark> Thanks Dave! I'll take a look at what options has.
[14:06:18] <kborchers> webBuilder: no, if you look at the remote datasource example and view source it doesn't http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[14:07:13] <bsock> ajpiano: won't that only cause it to run the function if the ajax method returns a 500? i was told earlier that i was more or less stupid because i was returning exceptions from my app with a 500 status
[14:07:44] <ajpiano> bsock: anything 4xx or 500 should trigger that
[14:07:55] <ajpiano> i would agree that you shouldn't use 500 for that
[14:08:19] <bsock> ajpiano: i'm trying to put in place a unified error handling method for potential errors from my server side code, not the server itself
[14:08:40] <webBuilder> kborchers, thank you so much that what exactly I was looking for
[14:09:13] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: I'm not seeing handle in the init options at http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#tabs … And when I ask for the slider element in the console, it just takes me to the HTML in firebug. Any tips for inspecting the slider object or finding a fuller list of options?
[14:09:15] <bsock> however, from my explorations, it seems like theres no way for me to register a global callback that can stop, or even interact with other callbacks that have been registered, its like jquery assumes that the only thing that can ever go wrong ever is a server error...
[14:09:15] <ajpiano> ok? whatever error code you want to return, it'll still fire that handler
[14:09:38] <bsock> someone in here told me that i should be returning 200 for exceptions from my app
[14:09:49] <ajpiano> that's not entirely unreasonable
[14:09:51] <ajpiano> i've done it
[14:10:02] <ajpiano> but also i've done something like, send down app exceptions using 417
[14:10:09] <ajpiano> and the excp as json that i parse out there
[14:10:17] <ajpiano> and handle some particular error code in a particular way
[14:10:58] <bsock> would i do that in the $.ajaxSetup place? or should i do that in a global ajaxError handler
[14:11:47] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: e.g., the values option allows moving sliders, but doesn't add additional
[14:11:58] <bsock> ajpiano: also, that seems like a bad use of the 417 error code, doesn't seem any more valid than me returning 500
[14:12:09] <ajpiano> bsock: in that case, i had some kind of wrapper that all my calls were going through
[14:12:26] <bsock> this seems like the sort of use case that jquery ought to support
[14:12:27] <ajpiano> i agree
[14:12:33] <ajpiano> there's a lot of different things you can do
[14:12:43] <ajpiano> none of them feel quite right
[14:12:51] <ajpiano> cause 4xx and 500 have specific meanings
[14:13:08] <bsock> i mean, it shouldn't be this hard to implement unified ajax error handling in jquery
[14:13:19] <ajpiano> bsock: you know that you can pass a map of status codes and callbacks?
[14:14:12] <bsock> ajpiano: yeah, but technically my exceptions should be 200's (according to folks in here earlier) so they'd still be going through my success callbacks, therefore causing me to have to do the error checks in every ajax call
[14:14:51] <ajpiano> bsock: yeah.  it's for reasons like this i typically just have a request wrapper in my apps
[14:15:09] <ajpiano> so that i can do some argument normalising and pre-processing of things before and after they're sent
[14:15:33] <bsock> ajpiano: strikes me as an oversight in jquery.... the way the handlers and such are set up look like they would work for this use case until you actually try to build it
[14:15:46] <ajpiano> bsock: we know that the global ajax events are kind of busted
[14:16:12] <ajpiano> cause there really is no mechanism by which you can really cancel things from propagating etc
[14:16:18] <bsock> right!
[14:16:42] <bsock> and the interaction between the specific callbacks on the $.get and $.post methods and the globals is really fuzzy
[14:17:05] <ajpiano> again, this is why i always end up with a request wrapper
[14:17:38] <bsock> sigh ;_;
[14:17:39] <bsock> wah wah
[14:18:51] <bsock> ajpiano: thanks. you were a lot more helpful than the guy earlier, he just made me feel stupid because i couldn't get this to work
[14:19:26] <ajpiano> bsock: sorry bout that :/
[14:19:36] <ajpiano> bsock: what's nice about a request wrapper especially in jquery 1.5 and above
[14:19:51] <ajpiano> is you can REALLY easily attach callbacks from the rest of your app without having to go crazy with option passing around
[14:19:55] <Dave-Stein> pdclark sorry i disappeared, i think i might confused resizable options :/
[14:20:00] <danagin> whats up? have an image in a div with text-align:center. I wanted to use a jquery annimation on load, but it seems when the annimation begins, the text-align:center is thrown out, alligning to the left for the whole animation, then popping back to center when it is done
[14:20:23] <danagin> please note, I'm totally new, just tinkering with something new at this point
[14:20:26] <bsock> ajpiano: i mostly use the $.get and $.post methods, not a whole lot of option fiddling
[14:20:49] <Dave-Stein> bsock: that's why i switched to $.ajax
[14:20:50] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: Yeah, about to give up on it. There is a handles array that's built on _create in the source, but no way to edit afterwards that I can tell
[14:21:13] <bsock> Dave-Stein: no, i mean like, i don't want/need a whole lot of option fiddling
[14:21:17] <Dave-Stein> pdclark: you can initialize slider and target it after, i do something similar to drag handles in jquery layout plugin
[14:21:42] <ajpiano> myapp.request = function(options) {  return $.ajax($.extend(options,{ success: function() { }, error: function() { }  }));   });   and then in handlers, myapp.request({url: "what/ever"}).then(function() { });
[14:21:56] <ajpiano> bsock: and then boom, now you just created your self a central area for all your ajax requests to clear through
[14:22:06] <ajpiano> and it's a lot easier to implement unified error handling
[14:22:25] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: Tried targeting… Maybe I just don't know how to access the object's array correctly. Thought it would just be $('.slider-class').slider().handles. Inside the plugin, it's referred to as this.handles
[14:22:29] <ajpiano> cause you're not reliant on all this jquery infrastructure of global event callbacks, you just have one place where you manage your clals in the same way
[14:22:37] <Dave-Stein> pdclark: you can make your own handle and then trigger events manually as if youre dragging the jquery handle, although im not sure why you need two handles for one slider
[14:22:49] <Dave-Stein> pdclark: are you trying to do osmething like that color picker in photoshop? thats only example i can think of :)
[14:23:00] <pdclark> Gradient picker in photoshop, yep
[14:23:07] <ajpiano> bsock:  for instance, you could just always use a "complete" callback, check if the 200 response was actually an app exception, etc.
[14:23:07] <pdclark> Actually, this:
[14:23:08] <pdclark> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[14:23:22] <Dave-Stein> i was just about to suggest that to ou
[14:23:24] <Dave-Stein> *you
[14:23:30] <pdclark> Just the slider part of it, exactly. He's using prototype, and requests people not use without permission. Hasn't answered e-mail yet.
[14:23:38] <Dave-Stein> o
[14:23:54] <Dave-Stein> i forgot it was prototype
[14:24:01] <Dave-Stein> my coworker uses it for grabbing the css rules all the time ha
[14:24:50] <Dave-Stein> i think instead of adding additional handles what you mean to do is create additional sliders
[14:25:00] <Dave-Stein> and then use css absolute positioning to ilne them up properly
[14:25:05] <Dave-Stein> and then affect a div on top of them which has the gradient
[14:25:19] <Dave-Stein> its not like you can click on the gradient in colorzilla either
[14:25:20] <chovy> if i have an <LI> how do I get it's position in the list?
[14:26:18] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: I'm confused. How would that be multiple sliders? I'm referring the "click to add a color stop" function: http://bit.ly/njZHEB
[14:26:21] <bsock> HAH!
[14:26:36] <bsock> i think i managed to hack something with prefilter so i don't have to do what i thought i was going to
[14:26:43] <Dave-Stein> yeah
[14:26:59] <Dave-Stein> think of that screenshot having 5 sliders absolute positioned to be same vertical space
[14:27:07] <Dave-Stein> that all haev the same width
[14:27:13] <Dave-Stein> and the css hiding the backgroundo f the bar
[14:27:27] <pdclark> Hmm… Interesting.
[14:27:31] <Dave-Stein> then you can bind to slide of each one and make sure they dont collide
[14:27:44] <Dave-Stein> so if slider 2 is about to be left more of slider 1, you stop the slide with stopprop
[14:27:44] <Dave-Stein> etc
[14:28:10] <Dave-Stein> thats just off the top of my head
[14:28:26] <pdclark> Guess my assumption was that the slider bar for the top-most slider would block the click event on the handles below. Maybe that can be avoided. I'll give it a try.
[14:28:29] <pdclark> Thanks for the suggestion.
[14:28:39] <bsock> ajpiano: i made a prefilter for the options that wraps the origianl success callback and checks for my error attribute on the json
[14:28:48] <Dave-Stein> chovy i have answer for ya
[14:29:02] <ajpiano> bsock: yeah that's a good approach
[14:29:08] <Dave-Stein> chovy: $.inArray( $('#li')[0], $('#list').children() )
[14:29:18] <Dave-Stein> returns index
[14:29:18] <ajpiano> i have a wrapper and a prefilter, covers most stuf
[14:29:19] <bsock> ajpiano: thanks so much for the help dude. those global handlers are nasty if you use them wrong
[14:29:37] <ajpiano> bsock: yeah, better off just putting your app in control
[14:29:57] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: On view source, looks like he has all sliders in one element, but I'll give stacking a try anyway. If I really want to stay away from prototype, I may just have to create draggables
[14:30:20] <Dave-Stein> cant compare a prototype slider to a jquery one :)
[14:30:45] <Dave-Stein> draggables wont be as good since youll have to manually control where they start and stop
[14:34:09] <pdclark> Dave-Stein: Not to mention getting values from their position. But stacking worked. You're a genius.
[14:34:32] <Dave-Stein> pdclark: if only
[14:34:59] <pdclark> lol
[14:35:19] <Dave-Stein> brb
[14:36:08] <Dave_Stein> and back
[14:36:13] <Dave_Stein> decided my name shuold match twitter like everyone else
[14:36:33] <ajpiano> i decided my irc handle should match my aol screen name
[14:36:37] <ajpiano> true story
[14:37:55] <Dave_Stein> but i know it also matches your twitter name haha

[15:11:17] <jsn00b> var show = function(){removeClass('display-none')}
[15:11:34] <jsn00b> then attach it to any object in the dom
[15:11:44] <imsky> wat
[15:12:23] <ajpiano> $.fn.removeClassDisplayNone = function() { return this.removeClass("display-none") });
[15:12:31] <ajpiano> $(this).removeClassDisplayNone();
[15:12:39] <ajpiano> awesome plugin!!!!!!!!11111one
[15:12:56] <imsky> lolol
[15:13:00] <Krambfhase> i bet ben alman has a plugin for that!
[15:13:02] <imsky> let me save you some code
[15:13:04] <imsky> .hide()
[15:14:31] <jsn00b> thanks ajpianno
[15:15:15] <imsky> party on cowboy
[15:16:59] <s34n> Does the transform plugin support the document() function?
[15:18:35] <Krambfhase> wow, i have been refactoring my code to use rAF animations and now that gets kicked out of jQ 1.6.3. meh.
[15:19:42] <imsky> it's been kicked out?
[15:20:09] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:20:12] <ajpiano> :/
[15:20:13] <imsky> hmm
[15:20:16] <imsky> that makes little sense
[15:20:31] <ajpiano> there's a blog post explaining the reasoning
[15:20:52] <ajpiano> i didn't want it to happen really either but thats what everyone agreed was best for now
[15:21:09] <zingbats> I'm writing a firefox extension which works with some code created with Prototype. As a result, this stupid code uses DOM prototypes (element.addClassName)... As a result, my elements created in jQuery need to have the same functionality. Is this possible with jQuery? (clone() doesn't copy them)
[15:21:12] <imsky> hmm i'll just stay on 1.6.2 for now >_>
[15:24:25] <javan> Could anyone help me with a jquery ui datepicker question? I'm trying to figure out why an inline datepicker automatically selects today - http://jsfiddle.net/EdK45/
[15:24:27] <lahue> ajpiano I was wondering if there is anyway I can contact you for some more help on the content slider I was working on earlier?
[15:24:49] <ajpiano> i'm a bit on the busy side
[15:25:03] <ajpiano> i can't right this minute
[15:25:14] <lahue> Alright, np, know anyone who might be able to/a good place to ask?
[15:25:43] <javan> It feels like a bug
[15:25:44] <ajpiano> i might be able to help you later or later this week, you might want to try kborchers
[15:26:09] <lahue> Ok I'll be on all night incase you get free time ;)
[15:26:44] <ajpiano> post yr fiddle again
[15:26:58] <lahue> http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/
[15:27:33] <lahue> And http://demo.webdeveloperplus.com/featured-content-slider/ is the live version to give you an idea of the thumbnails
[15:28:12] <Krambfhase> javan: thats a feature, i guess
[15:28:46] <Krambfhase> javan: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-defaultDate
[15:28:55] <ajpiano> lahue: can you describe exactly what's supposed to happen
[15:28:58] <javan> Krambfhase: I can't figure out a way to deselect it
[15:29:09] <ajpiano> and if i'm swapping some kind of image, where i'm getting the image i'm supposed to swap
[15:29:18] <javan> Krambfhase: I want to have no day selected, defaultDate won't do that
[15:29:36] <jpulgarin> Hey, having problems creating a regex to replace a certain variable in a string, any help would be appreciated: http://jsfiddle.net/F5q8d/ or http://pastie.org/2456774
[15:30:43] <lahue> OK when you load the page the first image is selected by default, therefore the small yellow car thumbnail should change to smallyellowcarover.jpg (just an example) when it scrolls to the next image, the yellow car thumbnail should go back to smallyellowcar.jpg and the highway thumbnail will become highwayover.jpg
[15:31:09] <ajpiano> ok
[15:31:12] <soee> how can i chek if selected item on list has value > 0 ?
[15:33:06] <Krambfhase> jpulgarin: parsing code with a regexp is generally not a good idea. you can't even parse brainfuck with an regexp.
[15:33:48] <ajpiano> lahue: good lord
[15:33:51] <ajpiano> this uses like ancient jquery
[15:33:54] <ajpiano> and jquery ui
[15:33:54] <ajpiano> wtf
[15:34:05] <lahue> lol yea, it was made back in 2009 i think?
[15:34:37] <ajpiano> sweet i get the event's i'm looking for
[15:34:40] <ajpiano> if just upgrade
[15:34:43] <Spadeski> Hey guys simple question Why does my <object> which is a html5 audio player work fine when i show alone but if i show with jquery it does not work
[15:35:12] <Spadeski> it shows but it also hides again
[15:35:31] <lahue> ajpiano can i update the jQuery w/o screwing up the exisiting code?
[15:35:40] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: Ahh, got you, any recommendations on how to go about this?
[15:35:43] <ajpiano> you have to make a minor change to the selector but that's it
[15:35:48] <ajpiano> i'm working it up right now
[15:35:54] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: Including, "it's not possible" :P
[15:36:02] <lahue> ok ty ;)
[15:36:03] <Krambfhase> jpulgarin: lets take a step back. what are you trying to do?
[15:36:15] <Spadeski> Anyone ?
[15:36:55] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: I have this code in a string. It will eval fine now, but on repeated evaluations I will not have the same context, so I'm trying to replace a var inside of it with it's actual value, so as to not need the context and be able to eval it properly
[15:37:52] <Krambfhase> a) why have code in a string b) don't use eval. d) learn javascript e) dont skip c)
[15:38:14] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: This is for an HTML templating library, it requires the code be evalled (one of those RARE times)
[15:38:27] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: ie to do stuff like <div data-if"i < 5">
[15:38:49] <Krambfhase> why not use on ov the over 9000 templating engines out there?
[15:39:04] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: I'm not writing it, just fixing a bug in it
[15:39:10] <Krambfhase> mkay
[15:39:13] <jpulgarin> Krambfhase: Not my own project, fixing a bug on an open source project
[15:39:32] <Krambfhase> well, instead of chaning the code, change the environment.
[15:39:51] <draginx> Is there anyway to get droppable's to have two scopes?
[15:39:54] <Krambfhase> (function(i){ eval( code); }( value));
[15:41:44] <lahue> ajpiano i was able to keep the same code and simply changing like 11 to           $("#featured").tabs({fx:{opacity: "toggle"}}).tabs("rotate", 5000, true);
[15:42:58] <ajpiano> yes that's all that had to change for the upgarde
[15:46:54] <|RicharD|> hi
[15:47:06] <|RicharD|> anybody use jquey ui draggable ?
[15:47:29] <Krambfhase> whats that, a survey?
[15:48:10] <|RicharD|> ehm
[15:48:21] <|RicharD|> i want that my user can't move outside the
[15:48:28] <|RicharD|> parent div container ?
[15:48:35] <|RicharD|> it's possibile ?
[15:49:40] <IanWizard> Odd thing... I can't use .draggable() on an SVG element, despite being a part of the dom.
[15:49:57] <Krambfhase> |RicharD|: try $( ".selector" ).draggable({ containment: 'parent' });
[15:49:57] <IanWizard> (No, it's using canvas, not SVG.)
[15:50:08] <IanWizard> Krambfhase, hmm, ok.
[15:50:32] <|RicharD|> http://studio40.infase.info/polaroids/index
[15:50:45] <|RicharD|> i'm use it on the plugin for polaroid photo
[15:50:52] <|RicharD|> it use draggable of jquery ui
[15:51:10] <IanWizard> Nope, I'm getting a TypeError
[15:51:14] <IanWizard> it's not deffined.
[15:51:24] <IanWizard> though it is in use on other parts of the page.
[15:51:54] <Krambfhase> |RicharD|: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-containment
[15:51:55] <IanWizard> The elements are created post-load, though I can't imagine that's the problem.
[15:52:24] <IanWizard> Krambfhase, yeah, I tried that, but the problem is that it's not defined on the jquery results.
[15:53:27] <|RicharD|> containment: 'parent'
[15:53:29] <Krambfhase> IanWizard: if i prefix a sentence with <NAMEHERE>: and <YOURNAME> is not equal to <NAMEHERE> then that sentence was not meant for you ;)
[15:53:37] <|RicharD|> i leave parent
[15:53:43] <|RicharD|> or i put id or something ?
[15:53:47] <IanWizard> Krambfhase, sorry, didn't notice that..
[15:54:20] <|RicharD|> ops it work :)
[15:54:22] <|RicharD|> great thx :)
[15:54:33] <Krambfhase> IanWizard: he elements are created post-load, though I can't imagine that's the problem. << well I DO.
[15:54:33] <IanWizard> Krambfhase, I just discovered that the bit with the canvas is being loaded in an IFrame.
[15:54:38] <IanWizard> Is that happening again?
[15:55:15] <IanWizard> Krambfhase, jquery.ui isn't on the page in the IFrame.  (I feel so stupid.)
[15:55:33] <Krambfhase> yeah, shit happens
[15:56:07] <lahue> Well that was weird :p
[15:57:27] <nohorse> somebody rebot freenode?
[15:59:22] <ajpiano> lahue: i think this is doing the trick

[16:00:26] <ajpiano> unfortuntely now i have legit no time to actually explain it right now
[16:00:35] <flayks> anyone have an idea why the submenu bug when i mouseleave the submenu ? http://jsfiddle.net/TbyMQ/
[16:01:22] <flayks> by the bottom*
[16:04:31] <tystr> woah
[16:04:49] <IanWizard> Ok, it's still not working.  I've made sure that I'm dragging by the handle, I've tried everything that I can think of.  Is ui.draggable designed not to work on SVG / canvas elements?
[16:04:54] <tystr> anyone else just see 100 people leave the room?
[16:05:32] <IanWizard> tystr, yeah, it was happening a while back too.  it's freenode having server trouble
[16:05:40] <IanWizard> tystr, feel better?

[16:06:03] <IanWizard> tystr, ^^
[16:06:49] <flayks> why the submenu doesn't hide when i quit the area by the bottom of the submenu ? http://jsfiddle.net/TbyMQ/

[16:08:38] <IanWizard> r1ch, I would, but my company's beta launches yesterday.
[16:08:45] <lahue> Yea i tried it out and it is working great,but the first one doesnt revert back,any ideas?
[16:09:07] <IanWizard> r1ch, yeah... it hasn't launched yet.
[16:09:23] <r1ch> IanWizard aah i see!
[16:09:48] <r1ch> IanWizard: may be looking at the same thing here if i don't get this sorted :S
[16:10:22] <ajpiano> r1ch: um
[16:10:30] <ajpiano> the problem is that you can't return the value of the success function
[16:10:59] <r1ch> ajpiano: its firing inside the ajax success function
[16:11:11] <ajpiano> yeah but that doesn't return to renderItem
[16:11:20] <ajpiano> and when it calls _returnItem() and uses the return value
[16:11:25] <ajpiano> which you're now making into ... nothing
[16:11:33] <ajpiano> what you could do is try something like
[16:11:34] <lahue> ajpiano any ideas?
[16:12:32] <lahue> It loads the alternative image for the first, but then just switches to others to the next file int he list
[16:13:03] <ajpiano> var li = $("<li>");  $.ajax({ success: function(results) {  li.append("<a>"+results.id+"</a>"); ) }});  return li
[16:13:07] <ajpiano> r1ch: try something like that
[16:13:18] <r1ch> ajpiano: cheers will try that
[16:13:30] <ajpiano> lahue: i think i see what's happening
[16:13:39] <lahue> ok ;)
[16:13:46] <Formfeed> Hi all, sorry not strictly a jQuery question but I'm looking for a file manager system which holds meta-data in MySQL, preferably HTML5 drag and drop and modern, all I can find are either DB backends with old school front end or modern front with just filesystem storage and no DB.  Thanks.
[16:18:47] <ajpiano> lahue: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/gHYRY/17/
[16:18:50] <ajpiano> i think it was a timing issue
[16:18:53] <ajpiano> i mean, it was
[16:18:56] <lahue> going now ;)
[16:19:12] <ajpiano> it fires the "show" event on the first tab on init, which means it hadn't had a chance to go thru and save the old src first
[16:19:27] <ajpiano> now i gotta roll
[16:19:31] <ajpiano> hope this helps
[16:19:59] <lahue> Ok Ill work with it, it still isnt working but ty for everything!
[16:20:00] <enjoycrf> hello my friends
[16:21:27] <ajpiano> lahue: now it doesn't get a change to have the show logic apply
[16:21:32] <ajpiano> you need to like
[16:21:36] <ajpiano> set a flag or some other thing
[16:21:45] <ajpiano> but i think i've taken it far enough, you can do a bit of programming now
[16:21:46] <ajpiano> :)
[16:22:10] <lahue> hah thanks, time to scour the web ;)
[16:23:45] <ajpiano> or think :)
[16:24:21] <lahue> lol I know close to 0 javascript :p
[16:24:47] <Krambfhase> like -0 ?
[16:24:58] <b1lly1> lahue: you might wanna start reading :)
[16:25:04] <lahue> zero is neither - or +
[16:25:12] <snover> au contraire.
[16:25:21] <snover> ?w signed zero
[16:25:22] <bot-t> snover, Signed zero - Signed zero is zero with an associated sign. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero
[16:25:31] <Krambfhase> lahue: touché tell that JavaScript!
[16:25:35] <lahue> hah yea I need to, i normally code in ColdFusion and my company is launching a site tomorrow
[16:25:38] <lahue> *this week
[16:25:56] <lahue> and this is one of the last things ;)
[16:25:57] <enjoycrf> coldfusion is so noob
[16:26:01] <enjoycrf> thats what i started w
[16:26:02] <enjoycrf> lol
[16:26:06] <lahue> yup but its what we use
[16:26:09] <lahue> now im doing PHP
[16:26:22] <enjoycrf> i dont understand y companies use it
[16:26:26] <enjoycrf> it costs a ton
[16:26:27] <b1lly1> did you take PHP on a date?
[16:26:35] <Krinkle> JavaScript! JavaScript! JavaScript!
[16:26:37] <lahue> it is very easy to understand
[16:26:44] <enjoycrf> php is the best for web
[16:26:52] <enjoycrf> thats what i did right after coldfuction
[16:26:59] <lahue> yup
[16:27:05] <Krinkle> [citation needed] ;-)
[16:27:10] <enjoycrf> cause i couldnt stand the html like syntax
[16:27:22] <enjoycrf> php is seriously the best all around language
[16:27:28] <AuroraX> How do i bind an onkeydown event to the body?
[16:27:41] <AuroraX> enjoycrf: lol
[16:27:48] <enjoycrf> super easy to use yet super powerful
[16:27:55] <b1lly1> AuroraX: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[16:28:14] <Krinkle> ?keydown
[16:28:14] <bot-t> .keydown(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keydown" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[16:28:32] <enjoycrf> $body.keydown?
[16:28:41] <enjoycrf> or jus cram it in the body tag lol
[16:28:44] <Krinkle> AuroraX: Depending, you might want either $(document).keydown to $('body').keydown
[16:28:50] <AuroraX> kraft: tried that, $("body").keydown(function(event) { bla bla bla });
[16:29:04] <enjoycrf> <body onkeydown="lol();"
[16:29:06] <r1ch> ajpiano: still seem to be having the same issue with the select not firing :S
[16:29:21] <Krinkle> probably better to use $(document)
[16:29:39] <AuroraX> Krinkle: what's the difference between binding it to document or the body?
[16:29:41] <enjoycrf> but yeah if u want to actualy utilize jquery its
[16:29:49] <enjoycrf> $('body').keydown
[16:29:51] <b1lly1> AuroraX: $("body").ready(function( $(this).keydown ?
[16:29:55] <Krinkle> AuroraX: Theoratically that body is part of the document
[16:30:11] <Krinkle> document is everything, catchall.
[16:30:18] <enjoycrf> yeah but i like dood
[16:30:23] <enjoycrf> i like to be meticulous
[16:30:31] <enjoycrf> so its $('body')
[16:30:32] <b1lly1> you prolly just need to wait for the body to finish loading, or put your event listener at the end of the markup
[16:30:55] <enjoycrf> no its $(document).ready
[16:31:04] <enjoycrf> then grab $('body')
[16:31:14] <AuroraX> its not working
[16:31:15] <enjoycrf> document is an object
[16:31:16] <Krinkle> Why would you want to wait until the entire document is ready ?
[16:31:21] <enjoycrf> iono
[16:31:26] <enjoycrf> body is a tag
[16:31:31] <AuroraX> $(document).keydown(function(e){alert("hgdgd");}
[16:31:33] <enjoycrf> so make it proper
[16:31:38] <AuroraX> $("body").keydown(function(e){alert("hgdgd");}
[16:31:40] <lahue> wrong place to say it, but im hating javascript lol
[16:31:49] <b1lly1> AuroraX: are you placing that after the </body> tag?
[16:31:59] <AuroraX> b1lly: inside it
[16:32:04] <Krinkle> You can manipulate elements as soon as they start. <body><script>$('body').addClass( 'foo' );</script> ……. </body> works.
[16:32:10] <enjoycrf> just takes experience
[16:32:15] <enjoycrf> try diff things
[16:32:26] <Krinkle> Or read documentation ;-)
[16:32:39] <enjoycrf> unless ur documenting
[16:32:47] <lahue> lol it takes a good amount of experience :p
[16:32:50] <b1lly1> AuroraX: jsfiddle it
[16:33:02] <lahue> what did ajpiano mean by setting a flag?
[16:33:17] <ajpiano> lahue lahue: i think this fixes it http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/gHYRY/20/ btw
[16:33:19] <enjoycrf> bye
[16:33:20] <AuroraX> b1lly: what's jsfiddle?
[16:33:21] <enjoycrf> lol
[16:33:31] <AuroraX> hmmmm
[16:33:55] <AuroraX> shit, enjoycrf was on drugs wasnt it? xD
[16:34:04] <lahue> god still not ajpiano dam lol
[16:34:09] <ajpiano> alright
[16:34:16] <ajpiano> i sense the more i think about this the less you will :p
[16:34:18] <ajpiano> so ya
[16:34:18] <lahue> it does it for the first image :p
[16:34:23] <lahue> lol
[16:35:24] <jsemar> hey guys I am having a problem with jqTouch, where any link in a tab bar does nothing: <a href='http://foo.com' target='_blank'></a>, the same link works anywhere else, except for in the <li> of the tabbar
[16:35:31] <jsemar> (also the link works if it is internal, or relative
[16:36:05] <b1lly1> AuroraX: jsfiddle is what ajpiano just linked.. jsfiddle.net
[16:36:14] <b1lly1> it's a javascript pastie
[16:36:29] <AuroraX> yes i saw it, very cool tool!! :D
[16:36:30] <draginx> how can I make an object draggable manually (and float to the user's mouse) with jquery-ui?
[16:36:49] <ajpiano> lahue: in other words, you can give a man a fish, and feed him for a day, or shove fish down his throat and kill him
[16:36:49] <b1lly1> ?draggable
[16:36:50] <bot-t> b1lly1, UI/Draggables/draggable - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/draggable
[16:37:11] <lahue> ik what u mean ;)
[16:37:39] <lahue> its jus extremely frustrating lol, but its ok ;)
[16:40:25] <draginx> im very well versed in draggable
[16:40:42] <draginx> and that wont particularly answer my question but thanks bill :P
[16:41:10] <draginx> hmm may be i can do $.trigger("dragstart") k
[16:44:01] <sanduz2> im using the ajax function on a url that returns html. where can i access this data?
[16:44:21] <Krambfhase> in the callback
[16:45:02] <b1lly1> sanduz2: in the function(data) { alert(data); }
[16:45:08] <b1lly1> in the callback*
[16:45:17] <sanduz2> so the callback function is the only place to access it? you cant save it to a variable?
[16:46:37] <sanduz2> like: var htmlData = jQuery.ajax("page.html").data() or something?
[16:47:14] <Krambfhase> nope.
[16:47:22] <sanduz2> weird...
[16:47:22] <Krambfhase> its asynchronus.
[16:47:49] <Krambfhase> meaning, you can only syve it to a variable using the callback
[16:48:22] <lahue> alright ajpiano im thinkin ill take the fish and be killed w/ it lol
[16:48:25] <sanduz2> Krambfhase, i see. thats weird. just out of curiosity, do you know why it has to be that way?
[16:49:17] <Krambfhase> because it's asyncronous. ie. if it was synchronus like Java or C getchar() your UI would block.
[16:49:40] <Krambfhase> that means the use can nolonger interact with the page while you do networking.
[16:49:46] <Krambfhase> which is stupid
[16:49:55] <sanduz2> Krambfhase, i see, thank you
[16:50:01] <Krambfhase> np
[16:50:02] <b1lly1> sanduz2: no

[16:58:25] <SIDU> table>tr>td>img :: img.onclick==>howto goto table.each(tr) and do something?
[16:59:24] <SIDU> $(this).parent().parent().children().each(function(){...}) ? seem not working
[17:00:57] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("tr").siblings().andSelf().each(fn);
[17:02:20] <SIDU> ok let me test ...
[17:02:48] <brianpWins> can you .live('hide') so if any of the dom elements match the selector even after their dynamically loaded to the page it'll hide them?
[17:03:35] <ajpiano> brianpWins: no
[17:03:57] <brianpWins> ajpiano: cool, I couldn't find anything in the docs just wanted to make sure! thanks
[17:04:10] <shesek> brianpWins, no, live() is used for events. you can simply add some CSS to do that, tho
[17:04:43] <shesek> simply `selector { display: none; }`
[17:04:47] <b1lly1> brianpWins: can't you use delegate?
[17:05:05] <brianpWins> b1lly1 delegate?
[17:05:12] <b1lly1> ?delegate
[17:05:12] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[17:06:29] <shesek> b1lly, how will that help him?
[17:06:49] <b1lly1> shesek: use with a combination of what you said?
[17:07:50] <b1lly1> this way new elements that are being introduced to the dom can be triggered from  the event?
[17:08:28] <brianpWins> b1lly1: cool looking into it but I don't think it'll quite do the trick
[17:08:37] <SIDU> ajpiano: ok.
[17:08:59] <shesek> b1lly1, there's no event for 'element being introduced to the dom'
[17:09:13] <shesek> you can't use delegate / live to be notified when an element is added to the DOM
[17:09:18] <SIDU> ajpiano: howto set table.each(tr).4th(td).addClass('hide') ?
[17:09:46] <ajpiano> lol
[17:09:54] <SIDU> ajpiano: tab.each('tr').eq(4).addClass('hide') ?
[17:10:07] <shesek> SIDU, $(table).find('tr td:nth-child(4)').addClass('hide') IIRC
[17:10:24] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("tbody").children(":nth-child(4n)").addClass("hide");
[17:10:28] <SIDU> shesek: wow . that's great. i m testing ...
[17:11:28] <shesek> oh, I didn't see your questions from before - you don't have the table DOM object, you need to go up to it first (using closest())
[17:12:59] <SIDU> shesek:  ajpiano love you very much for that :D
[17:13:30] <SIDU> that's the most happy thing i had so far :D
[17:14:06] <shesek> you welcome
[17:24:17] <coldhead> <ajpiano> "don't be unbeariable, use a variable"
[17:25:54] <darcyclarke> coldhead good qoute
[17:26:07] <darcyclarke> quote*
[17:35:14] <SIDU> shesek: i guess there is a better jq than this: tab.prev().find('tr td:first-child').show();
[17:36:09] <shesek> What's wrong with that ?
[17:37:10] <SIDU> shesek: nothing wrong. it is working anyway. but looking funny
[17:37:25] <shesek> nah, its fine.
[17:37:30] <SIDU> ok
[17:37:48] <shesek> if it should do the opposite of `addClass('hide')`, you probably want to remove that class too
[17:37:58] <shesek> otherwise you'll have a bunch of visible elements with 'hide' class
[17:39:02] <Kamakazi> if I have a form, instead of using the "action="phpfile"" could I just use ajax in my jquery validation routine to have the same effect?
[17:40:43] <shesek> Kamakazi, you can use AJAX to submit whatever HTTP request you want, including POST requests
[17:40:48] <shesek> there's nothing special about forms
[17:41:04] <Kamakazi> okay
[17:41:28] <shesek> (other than forms not having a same-domain origin policy on the request schema/host/port target)
[17:41:46] <Kamakazi> I'm sorry, is that english? ;)
[17:42:05] <shesek> ... they can be submitted to other domains too
[17:42:14] <Kamakazi> ok
[17:42:15] <shesek> while AJAX can be submitted to the same domain only
[17:42:36] <shesek> (or, strictly speaking, a protocol+domain+port combo)
[17:43:03] <echosystm> i need a library that can parse/serialise dates in w3c (iso 8601) format
[17:43:08] <echosystm> does anyone know of such a thing?
[17:49:19] <lahue> ajpiano I got it!
[17:49:24] <lahue> but no not really lol
[17:50:27] <Z3R0> is letterpress around ?
[17:52:05] <Kamakazi> shesek: Thanks for the help
[17:54:32] <r1ch> ajpiano: you got a minute to look at the link i pm you?
[18:03:34] <SIDU> shesek: $('tr td').html('....')  howto exclude the first td ?
[18:03:37] <echosystm> $('#start').datepicker({ onChangeMonthYear: function() { console.log("x") }});
[18:03:43] <echosystm> can anyone suggest a reason wh this doesnt work?
[18:03:48] <echosystm> when i change the date, nothing happens
[18:03:54] <echosystm> no console.log is run
[18:05:33] <SIDU> shesek: $('.tr td !:fitst-child').html('....') ??
[18:07:04] <kborchers> echosystm: works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/ktpVC/
[18:07:38] <kborchers> that event does not fire when you select a day, only when you change the month or year
[18:09:36] <SIDU> shesek: i make it: $('.tr').not(':first-child')... works :D
[18:10:06] <Z3R0_> bah this internet sucks balls
[18:13:30] <lahue> kborchers u around?
[18:14:07] <kborchers> i am
[18:14:32] <kborchers> what's up?
[18:14:36] <lahue> Would you love to help a noob?  ajpiano helped me 90% of the way, but I cant figured out the last 10%
[18:14:55] <kborchers> i can give it a shot ... whatcha workin' on?
[18:14:58] <lahue> He was helping me with http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/22/
[18:15:32] <lahue> What I need it to do is when the main image is selected, change the thumbnail to thumbnailover.jpg, when it rotates to the next image, set the old thumbnail back and change the next one.
[18:15:44] <lahue> ajpiano was able to get the first one set, but the last 3 do not work
[18:16:32] <kborchers> ok, let me take a look
[18:16:59] <lahue> ok ty ;)
[18:19:58] <baniczek> hi guys
[18:20:04] <coldhead> hi babe
[18:20:07] <baniczek> is middle of night
[18:20:12] <baniczek> and i have question
[18:20:12] <baniczek> http://wklej.to/tQt1J
[18:20:16] <baniczek> here it is
[18:20:48] <baniczek> omg
[18:20:51] <baniczek> maybe i know
[18:20:58] <baniczek> but i will wait for help
[18:21:37] <coldhead> baniczek: i don't completely understand your question
[18:21:51] <baniczek> my english is weak
[18:21:52] <coldhead> but maybe parents('ul') or closest('ul') is what you need?
[18:21:56] <coldhead> ?parents
[18:21:57] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[18:22:00] <coldhead> ?closest
[18:22:01] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:22:19] <baniczek> coldhead: im using parents()
[18:22:23] <baniczek> but its look like
[18:22:36] <coldhead> i thought it was parent()
[18:22:40] <baniczek> that var li contains only li + appended data
[18:22:53] <baniczek> im was using parentsUntil('div')
[18:23:00] <baniczek> parents('ul')
[18:23:00] <coldhead> ?parentsuntil
[18:23:01] <bot-t> .parentsUntil([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[18:23:16] <baniczek> and many others functions
[18:23:28] <coldhead> i don't understand why parentsUntil doesn't do what you need
[18:24:28] <baniczek> and li.<parents('ul') or parentsUntil('div')>.html() return only html of that li and added data
[18:24:36] <coldhead> $(this).parentsUntil('div.categories').filter('ul') ?
[18:24:40] <baniczek> i dont understand it too
[18:25:13] <baniczek> doesnt work to. its look like that parents (with others methods too) are only 2 level up
[18:28:55] <coldhead> baniczek: can you paste a working demo on jsfiddle with the html and the JS?
[18:29:03] <coldhead> then we can see what the problem is better
[18:29:10] <baniczek> ok moment
[18:30:53] <Krittick> If I know which elements are being changed by some rogue code, is there a way of finding out exactly what is changing them?
[18:31:35] <Krittick> even a browser plugin would be sweet. not feeling like going through 1000s of lines to manually check
[18:31:37] <coldhead> Krittick: in google chrome inspector you can set a breakpoint on dom modification
[18:31:43] <ajpiano> kborchers: it's weird cause of the timing of when it triggers the show on the first tab vs when the show is bound, kept flipping between combinations of done-ness
[18:31:47] <ajpiano> but i think you can see what the goal is
[18:31:50] <coldhead> and that will pause those fuckers in mid execution
[18:31:56] <coldhead> and you can see who
[18:31:57] <ajpiano> but now i'm eating dinner and off the comp
[18:31:59] <ajpiano> was cookin
[18:32:05] <ajpiano> and no r1ch i can't look right now sorry :)
[18:32:07] <ajpiano> gnite folks
[18:32:15] <coldhead> GNITE AJ
[18:32:21] <lahue> night ajpiano ty again for the help ;P
[18:32:24] <coldhead> <coldhead> <ajpiano> "don't be unbeariable, use a variable"
[18:32:25] <lahue> * ;)
[18:32:28] <kborchers> ajpiano: yeah, i see the goal ... hard to really "see" it with broken images though
[18:32:36] <Krittick> hrm, forgot entirely about the breakpoint thing. thanks coldhead, will try that
[18:33:01] <kborchers> i'll keep working though ... g'nite ajpiano
[18:33:32] <Kamakazi> when using the .post (or .ajax with a type of POST I guess) if I sent in something with with data (say name="bling") on the php side, is that treated just like a post, or do I need to do a different kind of processing
[18:33:35] <lahue> ik what u mean kborchers i have it \w/ image on my comp
[18:33:35] <r1ch> ajpiano np thanks for the help anyway
[18:38:14] <kborchers> lahue: how big are the small images?
[18:38:27] <lahue> let me double check
[18:38:41] <lahue> 80x50
[18:38:45] <kborchers> ok, thnx
[18:38:56] <lahue> np
[18:40:07] <Z3R0> letterpress you around ?
[18:40:51] <kborchers> lahue: i don't have the ability to do the over images but this should give an idea. is this what you need it to do? http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/23/
[18:41:08] <baniczek> coldhead: i dont get it. on jsfiddle works different that my script. but here it is http://jsfiddle.net/bTprB/10/ . my script on alert returns always 2
[18:42:15] <kborchers> took out the console.logs in this one http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/24/
[18:43:23] <kborchers> lahue: although it seems to work the same as before ... hmmm. what is the issue again lahue ?
[18:43:24] <baniczek> coldhead: wrong. im using .html() exactly and parents levels up are only 2 - added_ul and li
[18:46:28] <coldhead> baniczek: so it works okay on jsfiddle and not on your own page?
[18:47:18] <kborchers> lahue: hmmmm, this changes it back to the way it was and it seems to work properly for me in Chrome and FF. can you explain again what is wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/25/
[18:47:39] <baniczek> coldhead: i found this: "Stored selections don't magically update when the DOM changes. " im storing selection in variable, how to update this stored variable in dom?
[18:48:04] <lahue> kborchers ive tried it in IE and it only switches the first image, not the others
[18:48:06] <baniczek> wrong again
[18:48:07] <baniczek> damn it
[18:48:08] <coldhead> don't store it, query it again?
[18:48:47] <kborchers> hmmm, ok let me fire up my VM to test on IE
[18:48:57] <lahue> ok im gonna try it in FF
[18:49:43] <lahue> it works great in FF, but not IE :(
[18:50:06] <baniczek> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/bTprB/11/ check this
[18:50:24] <baniczek> html contains only added_ul and one li
[18:50:43] <kborchers> lahue: ok, well at least that's something to go on. we all now IE sucks, now we just have to figure out what the reason is this time
[18:50:52] <lahue> lol yea
[18:51:08] <lahue> is there an easy way to make the replacement of the image instant?
[18:52:58] <kborchers> lahue: you mean the small image?
[18:53:10] <lahue> yea when it reverts back to the normal image
[18:53:15] <lahue> how can i have it be instant?
[18:53:43] <coldhead> baniczek: i think .html() is only being applied to the first/nearest parent UL
[18:53:47] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/bTprB/12/
[18:53:57] <coldhead> that uses the last one and seems to have much more in it
[18:54:02] <kborchers> i think the problem there is that it has to happen after the show so it doesn't happen until the big image is done animating
[18:54:27] <baniczek> oh
[18:54:27] <lahue> hmm ok, is there anyway to speed up the animation of the big image?
[18:54:46] <baniczek> coldhead: big thx
[18:55:15] <baniczek> but something told me that is not a solution
[18:55:19] <baniczek> but i will try
[18:55:35] <baniczek> and ask of course :<
[18:57:00] <coldhead> good luck baniczek
[18:57:22] <kborchers> lahue: i'll have to look up if it can be faster but this removes the animation and it is instant http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/27/
[18:58:04] <lahue> ty ;)
[19:00:35] <kborchers> lahue: i think this is the best you can do to speed up the animation http://jsfiddle.net/gHYRY/28/ but still obviously a delay
[19:01:02] <lahue> sweet ty
[19:04:14] <lahue> Stupid IE :(
[19:04:38] <kborchers> lahue: let me guess, you're not using IE9 either
[19:04:46] <lahue> no, it is IE :p
[19:05:00] <lahue> 9
[19:05:05] <kborchers> works for me
[19:05:34] <lahue> lol wow :p
[19:06:18] <lahue> hmm i opened a new window and it works in it :p
[19:06:28] <lahue> i wonder if one of the resourches was cached
[19:06:41] <lahue> ty guys so much!
[19:07:07] <kborchers> no problem
[19:07:27] <lahue> now i gotta test safair, IE 8, and  7 lol
[19:07:42] <kborchers> plus i got to use placekitten.com so it was worth it ;)
[19:07:53] <lahue> baha
[19:08:04] <lahue> i didnt kno that was a site
[19:08:35] <kborchers> the fiddle looks good in safari here
[19:08:45] <lahue> sweet ty!
[19:09:33] <kborchers> good luck with the older IE's but i think it should be ok ... we work hard to make sure the UI widgets work with older versions of IE .. even back to 6
[19:12:13] <r1ch> has anyone got a minute to look over this: http://jsfiddle.net/bNpcw/
[19:12:34] <lahue> sweet ty kborchers
[19:12:41] <kborchers> np
[19:13:11] <kborchers> r1ch: what's going on there? i think i was looking at this earlier but don't remember
[19:14:01] <r1ch> kborchers: it seems that the variable cardno is being cached and therefore not being fetched each time from the ajax call
[19:14:40] <r1ch> kborchers: if you type applescript then another value into the drop down box you will see what i mean
[19:15:49] <kborchers> r1ch: actually if you look at firebug, or the chrome console, you'll see that you get an error that cardno is not defined
[19:16:51] <kborchers> r1ch: http://jsfiddle.net/bNpcw/1/
[19:16:57] <enerel> I need to resize an iframe from WITHIN the iframe.  In other words, the iframe loads myFunctions.js, which contains a function that can resize the iframe
[19:17:10] <enerel> is it possible?
[19:17:19] <r1ch> kborchers: sorry card no is set in the ajax call which should be run for each result from the drop down but it appears that as it is a global variable the same value is being set for each
[19:18:47] <r1ch> kborchers: i have changed the json url will pm you a link with the correct value
[19:32:28] <kborchers> r1ch: i'm not sure i am going to be able to help ... there are a number of issues here. i think your biggest issues are you shouldn't, and actually i don't think you can use async: false with JSONP. also, your data should be compiled server side. you can't format the data in a return value that counts on the async false issue and expect _renderItem to know what you're talking about
[19:33:44] <kborchers> are you writing the server side that is returning the JSON?
[19:34:23] <r1ch> kborchers: yes however the initial datasource is based off a select which contains the lookup value
[19:35:02] <r1ch> kborchers: the value of the select then needs to be looked up against the JSON to return a second value
[19:36:32] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure how to get that to work. i have never tried to get autocomplete to work with 2 datasources that have to be compared to each other. why do you need that comparison anyway?
[19:39:11] <r1ch> kborchers: sorry each option of the select contains the facebook id of a user which is the datasource that populates the drop down. for each facebook id i need to fetch an id from our database via json which is presented in the drop down along with the data from the select
[19:40:41] <kborchers> r1ch: ok, so why can't that be done when you create the select? why do you need autocomplete for this at all?
[19:42:45] <r1ch> kborchers: the select is the datasource for the combobox.  this additional id from our database can't be done server side
[19:45:59] <r1ch> kborchers: therefore i need to find some way of running this ajax call for each option in the select which populates the combo box. the result of the ajax call being placed in the comboboxes autcomplete field for each result returned
[19:47:17] <kborchers> r1ch: ok, but what i'm saying is why not just grab all of the additional id's on page load via ajax. once the select is created, you could serialize all of the facebook id into something you pass to your server via ajax, then you send back all of the corresponding database id's associated with the fb id's and update your select. then you can initialize your combobox on that updated select
[19:47:31] <sjuxax> Hello. I have many elements with the same ID. I know this is usually bad, but I want it this way this time. I would like $('#id') to modify/select all of these. How can I make that happen?
[19:47:58] <kborchers> sjuxax: that's not just bad it's wrong and that will not work
[19:48:07] <kborchers> why not use a class
[19:48:20] <sjuxax> kborchers: because classes are harder to select with attr('id')
[19:48:21] <sjuxax> :(
[19:48:27] <sjuxax> I will have to make up a fake attribute I guess
[19:48:36] <kborchers> why??
[19:48:47] <kborchers> $(".className").doShit()
[19:49:42] <kborchers> you should not make fake attr's either as that is invalid HTML markup
[19:49:44] <sjuxax> because I am getting the item's ID from the id attr: id = "save-{GUID}"
[19:49:56] <sjuxax> so attr('id').replace('save-', '')
[19:50:00] <sjuxax> for the real GUID
[19:50:34] <kborchers> sjuxax: but if it's a GUID, should that not be unique as well?
[19:50:41] <courpse> or a dataset.
[19:51:44] <sjuxax> kborchers: the GUID is unique. don't worry about it, I guess I will just use not id
[19:52:28] <kborchers> sjuxax: if they all have id="save-{GUID}" and {GUID} is unique for every element, you can just do $("[id^='save-']").... to select every element with an id that starts with save-  does that help?
[19:56:45] <acidjazz> am i doing this the best way : var params = {}; $('.signup input').each(function(index) { params[$(this).attr('name')] = $(this).val(); });
[19:57:22] <kborchers> ?serialize @ acidjazz
[19:57:23] <bot-t> acidjazz, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:58:35] <kborchers> acidjazz: are you doing this for the data option of a $.ajax call?
[20:16:43] <coldhead> any lunch suggestions
[20:16:45] <coldhead> pls
[20:22:37] <abjorn> @coldhead: pasta
[20:25:35] <r1ch> kborchers: solved the issue using your advice and removing the ajax call. thanks :)
[20:26:10] <kborchers> glad to hear ... should be much simpler now too ;)
[20:31:36] <coldhead> thanks abjorn
[20:32:08] <abjorn> no probs buddy
[20:49:52] <acidjazz> is it possible to place html right _after_ an element?
[20:50:08] <acidjazz> or take html out of an element, create an element out of it and assign it like an ID?
[20:56:47] <chachan> guys, I searching for a library/plugin which allow me create images from a selector. Something like $(".whatIwant").createImage()
[20:56:56] <chachan> any idea?
[20:57:57] <chachan> I actually don't expect that it works so easy but you might get my idea of what I want
[21:13:24] <draginx> is there a .delegate eventType for ajax commands/content being changed?
[21:14:23] <draginx> $("span.hover, div.hover").wTooltip(); have this and I want to basically apply live to it
[21:19:38] <futini> hi, its is possibly $("#div").load("<?php echo 'hi'?>");?
[21:22:09] <draginx> yeah itll be $('#div').load('hi');
[21:22:15] <draginx> assuming ur parsing under a php file
[21:22:25] <draginx> if u wish to load a php file ull have to make it separate
[21:22:38] <draginx> or separate controller/method (l-o-l @ php @ mvc)
[21:22:42] <draginx> php & mvc*
[21:23:59] <futini> thanks draginx
[21:24:05] <draginx> yup
[21:28:32] <educr0w> Hello, I have this http://jsfiddle.net/VPGSE/7/ using table row and table cell, I try to use margin 2px in the cell but I can't have a space between cells, how can I do that?
[21:28:42] <educr0w> sorry..was for another channel
[21:33:20] <chl5011> I have code like http://pastebin.com/2BhCff19 The effect I want is to click on the item X, then the text will be displayed at the right hand side. The current issue is that I can not obtain the original item text. For instance, alsert(event.target.text) (of course not working ). But searching jquery api/ doc, seemingly there is no further explain on how to use this object.
[21:37:24] <jcw4> @chl5011, you mean how to use the event.target object?
[21:39:35] <chl5011> @jcw4: I want to obtain the name of the item and show it on the right hand side. For instance, I click `item 1', then the right hand side text can be replaced with `item 1'.
[21:40:20] <chl5011> using html can completely replace the text at the right hand side, but I can not find a way to add the name of the item clicked by user.
[21:41:56] <jcw4> chl5011, I'm not sure what the 'right' answer is; but I'd register the click handler on the actual <li> elements and then just use $(this).text()
[21:42:46] <jcw4> $("#left li").click(…)
[21:44:24] <chl5011> @jcw4: it just works. great thanks!
[21:44:44] <jcw4> chl5011, good :)
[21:47:39] <educr0w> I was looking an example of prototype that use Ajax.Updater(destination_id_element, php file, query) and the php file answer an html that is attached to destianation_id_element, is that a good way of doing ajax website?
[21:56:16] <tash1> if I want to make sure that every field in a form is filled out, can't I do var whatever = $("#whatever").val(); then do if ( whatever == null ) { // alert("something"); } ?
[21:57:22] <jcw4> tash1; if you repeat that code for each element.   Also, I'd test for empty string too, but that might be superstitious
[22:01:21] <tash1> jcw4: does this look right to you? http://www.pastie.org/2458284
[22:03:50] <nebbie> doesn't val() returns empty string if it's empty? at least that's what I would expect
[22:04:03] <tash1> not sure to be honest
[22:04:07] <tash1> how do you check for that?
[22:04:09] <jcw4> tash1; despite my free advice on this channel, I'm not actually a jquery/javascript expert --- I think that code looks good, but I'd personally test for empty string rather than null
[22:04:28] <jcw4> varname == ''
[22:04:42] <tash1> pretty sure I already tried that, but I'll have a go again
[22:04:50] <nebbie> easiest thing is to do a console.log(<variable>);
[22:06:43] <Spadeski> Hello ppl
[22:07:48] <tash1> nebbie: good idea. In firefox it automatically tells me I need to fill out the fields (not my alert)...same in chrome.  In IE, though, that doesn't happen. How do you check the console.log in IE or Safari?
[22:07:55] <tash1> b/c it is also not working in Safari
[22:09:05] <tash1> hmm
[22:09:19] <tash1> checked ff, fname is not defined
[22:09:27] <nebbie> pretty sure there are firebug implementations for them.. IE 8 had development mode or whatever..
[22:09:33] <tash1> k, i'll look thanks
[22:09:34] <_numbers> with all these javascript mvc libraries that support routing with fragment hashes, how are ppl handling seo? doesnt that just destroy the page's ability to rank?
[22:09:54] <nebbie> i mean if u need, u can always just use alert() like I used to do.. heh
[22:11:27] <tash1> nebbie and jcw4: got it fixed, thanks
[22:11:38] <jcw4> nice, what was the fix?
[22:12:00] <coldhead> people are just assuming their stuff will be so popular and awesome they won't need search engine rank
[22:12:36] <coldhead> or they're building crawlable static sites and adding js mvc on top
[22:12:50] <coldhead> or they're using that hilarious standard google proposed to index ajax
[22:13:12] <tash1> if you look at my pastie from earlier, I changed null to '' and I added an = after un (only had 1). And, I added a space after each var name and after the second equals sign ... so http://www.pastie.org/2458316
[22:13:29] <tash1> I'm not sure if the space after the var name and after 2nd = matters or not
[22:13:41] <tash1> since I changed two things at once :P
[22:14:20] <jcw4> I don't think the space would have changed anything, but the missing = and the '' would make a difference
[22:15:40] <coldhead> don't close the blast doors of your heart
[22:16:13] <tash1> I just noticed something, but not sure how to fix.  My jQ form that I'm dealing with, if you don't fill any fields out (in firefox) and click submit, you get a "Please fill out this field" message on the first input.  And, all of the inputs have a red border around them.  In chrome, the form doesn't submit, but the "Please fill out this field" appears in a totally random place on the page.
[22:16:18] <Spadeski> sup everyone
[22:16:25] <futini> la mansa cag
[22:16:29] <tash1> that message doesn't appear at all in IE or Safari ... is this a browser specific thing?
[22:16:48] <futini> awesome user count
[22:17:24] <derek[AHX]> i such apples
[22:22:04] <Spadeski> Hey can someone help me with a simple jquery project veryeasy just aint workin right
[22:23:22] <dr0id> nope
[22:26:08] <nebbie> just paste the code in a pastie or something, someone may get around to help you
[22:26:36] <Spadeski> ok
[22:28:09] <SIDU> now i download a jq ui zip, i only need the horizontal resizeable, do i need to include all the ui.cor.js, mouse.js etc ?

[22:39:47] <acidjazz> how do i get width minus scrollbar width??
[22:40:10] <acidjazz> [02:58] < kborchers> acidjazz: are you doing this for the data option of a $.ajax call?
[22:40:12] <acidjazz> kborchers: yes
[22:44:51] <acidjazz> yea i cant find any solution for getting a browser width minus its scrollbar
[22:56:28] <madprops> acidjazz, make a div with width 100% and get it's width in px maybe
[23:07:23] <acidjazz> no madprops 100% divs bleed across the status bar
[23:13:34] <draginx> u sure?
[23:13:39] <draginx> they shouldnt with 0 margins and padding..
[23:13:50] <draginx> set the height to 101%
[23:14:43] <draginx> i dont think any browsers give u information about its elements/scrollbar especially any of microsoft's products :P
[23:17:59] <Spadeski> hey if i post the link of my site will yall givefeedbaack
