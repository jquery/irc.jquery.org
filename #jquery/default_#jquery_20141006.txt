[00:06:51] <P0rk> Okay, now I have a better understanding of what's happening.
[00:08:02] <anli_> I am trying to use jquery ui datepicker as dateTimePicker, however, I cannot set dateFormat to include hours and minutes
[00:08:19] <anli_> So MVC validation will fail
[00:10:28] <Cork> anli_: as far as i remember you can't use datepicker as a time picker without extending it
[00:10:43] <P0rk> Paradisee, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/08ovhuwu/14/
[00:10:56] <anli_> I am using jquery-ui-timepicker-addon.js
[00:12:08] <anli_> It is so strange, I get a validation error saying The field XXX must be a date, but I cannot search my project for the string "must be a date"
[00:12:18] <anli_> Without ":s
[00:12:29] <Cork> anli_: is the field an <input type="date">?
[00:12:45] <anli_> text
[00:13:19] <anli_> I also tried to search "must be a", no hits
[00:13:30] <anli_> How can I get an error message that is not included in the project :)
[00:13:44] <Cork> you most likely haven't looked in the translation file
[00:14:10] <anli_> You mean that the utility to search all files do not look in all files?
[00:14:46] <Cork> anli_: could you make a fiddle with the problem?
[00:15:09] <anli_> Seems hard, its MVC
[00:15:14] <anli_> Together with jquery
[00:15:35] <Cork> anli_: well what i need is the datepicker with the validation error
[00:15:37] <Cork> not the rest
[00:16:01] <anli_> Ok, I will do one
[00:16:16] <P0rk> Paradisee, here you go. This will work: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/08ovhuwu/18/
[00:16:20] <Cork> sorry datetimepicker with the validation error
[00:21:30] <anli_> http://jsfiddle.net/xr4bksn1/
[00:21:55] <anli_> Well, the validation error will not be visible now, maybe I could add the validation javascripts
[00:22:12] <anli_> Lets see
[00:27:42] <anli_> Tried to add jquery.validate and unobtrusive... http://jsfiddle.net/xr4bksn1/2/
[00:27:47] <anli_> Does not do client side validation
[00:28:11] <Cork> so the error most likely comes from your mvc?
[00:30:08] <anli_> It comes from the client side, the form never gets posted
[00:30:17] <anli_> But maybe mvc has produced the script that causes the validation
[00:31:35] <anli_> I am using Html.TextBox, maybe I should create the form element manually
[00:31:49] <Cork> anli_: try opening the page and ask the dev tools to search through all loaded resources
[00:31:55] <Cork> should give you a hint where it comes from
[00:32:15] <anli_> Search the js then?
[00:32:25] <Cork> js and html
[00:32:41] <anli_> The validation error has been produced server side because it is included as an attribute to the input element
[00:33:03] <Cork> you mean the validation test?
[00:33:06] <Cork> "must be a date"?
[00:33:10] <anli_> yeah
[00:33:35] <anli_> I cannot search it, so it must be produced outside my project
[00:39:47] <anli_> I almost made it constructing my own input element, now I only have to add the validation snippet, so it becomes required :)
[00:40:10] <anli_> @Html.TextBox seems to come up with own validations
[00:52:48] <Zladivliba> hello !
[00:53:11] <Zladivliba> how do I disable an element of a form AND submit it's content ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/146769b411d50460db4a
[00:53:32] <Zladivliba> once I've disabled the form's element I can't access it anymore...
[01:57:16] <anli_> Can I write a template For DateTime? and another for DateTime ? ;)
[02:09:56] <Hydro> Quick question. Going over the learning basics of jquery and javascript. I'm looking into the function page here - http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/functions/
[02:10:21] <Hydro> In Functions as Arguments, I can't really understand why "var result = fn();"
[02:10:27] <Hydro> why would you call a variable as a method?
[02:27:53] <xec_> Hydro: do you understand the next part? where a function is passed in to myFn()?
[02:28:34] <xec_> Hydro: this is also a good read: http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html
[02:34:59] <Hydro> xec_, I do, I'm just confused about using a variable as a method without declaring it.
[02:35:02] <Hydro> Just seems out of the blue.
[02:41:18] <xec> Hydro: it's declared as an argument
[02:42:24] <xec> function myFn( fn ) { /* fn is whatever is passed in as the first argument */ }
[02:43:49] <xec> so if you pass in a function, like myFn(function(){/* do something*/}) -- "fn" will be a reference to that function and it makes sense to do fn() inside the myFn
[02:46:31] <Hydro> ah okay.
[02:46:47] <Hydro> I thought the function-argument would be evaluated prior to calling the function
[02:47:28] <Hydro> This means that whenever making custom functions you always have to check the type of the arguments, doesn't it?
[02:47:38] <mooncup> not really
[02:47:45] <mooncup> unless you're gonna be calling it when you shouldn't
[02:50:58] <Hydro> or if you want to make it generic
[02:51:12] <Hydro> where it could handle both a function as an argument and... other types.
[03:13:06] <prawnosun> how to check if element has focus?
[03:14:38] <prawnosun> $("..").is(":focus")
[03:14:40] <prawnosun> thanks
[03:14:42] <m1su> $('#link').is(':focus')
[03:19:05] <prawnosun> does .keydown() work in inputs? mine doesn't seem so, anyone getting this?
[03:19:32] <Cork> prawnosun: it does, though you most likely want on('input'
[03:19:57] <prawnosun> i'll try that, thanks
[03:20:21] <Cork> it will most likely fail too as they is closely related
[03:20:27] <Cork> make sure your selector works
[03:24:38] <prawnosun> Cork: real mess http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/
[03:25:45] <Cork> prawnosun: don't put tag names infront of ids
[03:26:19] <prawnosun> just #email?
[03:26:40] <prawnosun> not input#email
[03:26:41] <prawnosun> ?
[03:26:44] <Cork> yes
[03:26:52] <prawnosun> OK to do with class?
[03:27:02] <Cork> no
[03:27:03] <prawnosun> input.email?
[03:27:06] <Cork> that was an id
[03:27:10] <Cork> just do #email
[03:27:22] <prawnosun> but is it ok to do if it was class?
[03:27:27] <prawnosun> i mean
[03:27:27] <Cork> ids are unique by definition
[03:27:37] <prawnosun> yeah that does make sense
[03:27:38] <Cork> it has its use with classes
[03:27:44] <Cork> though it has the same drawback
[03:28:04] <decx> btw, are ids with dots in them valid?
[03:28:07] <Cork> selector speed is id > class > element name > attribute
[03:28:12] <Cork> yes
[03:28:20] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/2/
[03:28:23] <Cork> decx: you can have css selectors in your ids
[03:28:32] <decx> #myid.notaclass for div id="myidnotaclass"
[03:28:42] <Cork> <input "div > * > .content #something">
[03:28:43] <decx> with a dot of course
[03:28:46] <Cork> opps
[03:28:49] <Cork> <input id="div > * > .content #something">
[03:28:52] <Cork> valid ^
[03:28:58] <decx> the fuck
[03:29:00] <decx> :o
[03:29:01] <prawnosun> Cork: it's suppose to show Someone@example.com on load but it's blank
[03:29:07] <Cork> you can even use it in css
[03:29:22] <prawnosun> Cork: and when you focus on it it doesn't go blank
[03:29:24] <Cork> #div\ \>\ \*\ \>\ \.content\ \#something {}
[03:29:59] <Cork> prawnosun: why not just use placeholder?
[03:30:09] <decx> because this doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/14n4wnjm/
[03:30:24] <Cork> prawnosun: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/3/
[03:30:47] <Cork> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/14n4wnjm/1/
[03:31:01] <decx> neat
[03:31:05] <decx> thx cork
[03:31:06] <prawnosun> Cork: You make me look stupid pretty good :)
[03:31:07] <Cork> not really
[03:31:18] <Cork> prawnosun: lol, sorry
[03:31:20] <decx> not that i would ever use it, but it's neat :D
[03:31:34] <prawnosun> Cork: Is placeholder working for all browser version?
[03:31:42] <decx> not in old ie of course
[03:31:43] <Cork> ?mdn input
[03:31:44] <b-ot> Cork: <input> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input
[03:32:03] <Cork> placeholder 	2.3 	4.0 (2.0) 	? 	11.10 	4
[03:32:03] <prawnosun> Cork: I have a feeling it's not
[03:32:06] <decx> from ie10
[03:32:23] <prawnosun> ah so IE7,8,9 wont work
[03:32:24] <Cork> prawnosun: there are shims you can use for older browsers
[03:32:46] <Cork> like ex. https://github.com/parndt/jquery-html5-placeholder-shim
[03:33:46] <Cork> this link was more readable http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-placeholder
[03:33:48] <frank_o> haha parndt that bastard
[03:34:03] <frank_o> greetings Cork :)
[03:34:08] <Cork> o/
[03:34:21] <Cork> i usually write my own, for ie 9
[03:34:27] <Cork> don't really care about the rest
[03:34:46] <emocakes__> but what about ie6?
[03:34:50] <prawnosun> for learning purposes, what am i doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/2/
[03:34:57] <prawnosun> will probably use the shim though
[03:34:58] <emocakes__> many organisations in india still use ie6
[03:35:05] <prawnosun> and china
[03:35:12] <emocakes__> there are nearly 1billion people in india!
[03:35:26] <Cork> prawnosun: well first of all, as the text is in the field
[03:35:27] <emocakes__> most people can not afford to that many people lose
[03:35:34] <Cork> you get the cursor position at the wrong place
[03:35:53] <Cork> secondly .empty() is for dom elements, not form elements
[03:35:59] <Cork> you need to use .val('') there
[03:36:10] <Kartagis> prawnosun: you style .hasFocus, but where is it in HTMLP?
[03:36:26] <Kartagis> HTML*
[03:36:33] <Cork> Kartagis: in the css
[03:36:37] <prawnosun> Kartagis: for CSS
[03:36:42] <Cork> he adds it on focus
[03:36:53] <prawnosun> arent form elements part of DOM?
[03:37:06] <Kartagis> oh didn't see addClass
[03:37:11] <Cork> prawnosun: they are, but they behave quite different
[03:37:19] <Cork> prawnosun: also you could just use :focus in css
[03:37:22] <Cork> not need for js there
[03:37:58] <prawnosun> so much to fix up :)
[03:38:46] <prawnosun> I like to put behaviourial stuff with javascript
[03:39:00] <prawnosun> :focus in css seems messy for me
[03:39:10] <bloodyscythe> Hi there. Does anyone know good sites on how to learn jQ (except the documentation)?
[03:39:27] <Kartagis> bloodyscythe: jquery.com
[03:39:32] <decx> http://try.jquery.com/
[03:39:40] <Kartagis> that ^
[03:39:54] <bloodyscythe> oh, I've already completed that
[03:40:10] <Kartagis> stackoverflow.com
[03:40:20] <Cork> prawnosun: also i recommend STRONGLY against skipping brackets after your if statements
[03:40:24] <Cork> its a known source of bugs
[03:40:30] <Kartagis> that is a good resource
[03:41:06] <frank_o> Hi! Anybody know how to add a `destroy` method to https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/blob/v2.0.0-rc1/src/snap.js? Gotta make it work across multiple jQuery Mobile pages: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/phpyf0ws/5/
[03:41:07] <Kartagis> may I ask, what is $('[placeholder]') ?
[03:41:19] <bloodyscythe> Okay thank you Kartagis
[03:41:27] <Kartagis> sure thing
[03:41:38] <Kartagis> and decx too
[03:41:40] <prawnosun> Cork: where the brackets?
[03:41:43] <Cork> Kartagis: select all elements with an attribute of placeholder
[03:42:00] <Cork> prawnosun: if() $(this).empty();
[03:42:04] <Cork> prawnosun: if() { $(this).empty(); }
[03:42:39] <prawnosun> you need {} if you have more than one line of code
[03:43:57] <Cork> yes, but like i said
[03:44:05] <Cork> skipping that is a known source of bugs
[03:44:47] <Cork> it is very easy to make mistakes where the code does something other then you thought
[03:45:56] <prawnosun> so always use {}
[03:45:58] <prawnosun> got it
[03:46:27] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/4/
[03:46:30] <prawnosun> still not working
[03:47:34] <Cork> prawnosun: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/5/
[03:47:42] <Cork> this one has a serious limitation though
[03:47:47] <Cork> it can't handle password fields
[03:47:59] <Cork> normally the best option is to use an overlay instead
[03:49:04] <prawnosun> and it doesn't work in IE11
[03:49:12] <Cork> this one does
[03:49:17] <prawnosun> and i do need support for passwords.
[03:49:20] <Cork> it isn't using placeholder
[03:49:21] <prawnosun> time for dat shim
[03:49:56] <Cork> it is most likely the simplest ya
[03:50:17] <Cork> there is quite a few edge cases you need to think about if you want to do it your self
[03:50:19] <prawnosun> FYI. on focus it doesn't work Cork
[03:50:34] <prawnosun> ill try on chrome
[03:50:57] <Cork> you mean the cursor movment?
[03:51:17] <prawnosun> when i click on it, it doesnt go blank
[03:51:20] <Cork> there isn't really anything else happening on focus
[03:51:31] <Cork> it didn't before either
[03:51:37] <Cork> that happens on first keystroke
[03:52:12] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/3/
[03:52:18] <prawnosun> should work like that :)
[03:52:28] <Cork> it does except for the color
[03:52:57] <prawnosun> on focus should go blank like the placeholder
[03:53:12] <Cork> *unlike the placeholder :)
[03:53:23] <prawnosun> lol
[03:53:24] <prawnosun> yeh
[03:53:28] <Cork> the placeholder by spec is shown until first keypress
[03:53:50] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/5/ doesnt behave like http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/2/
[03:53:52] <Cork> well that simplifies things quite a bit
[03:54:03] <prawnosun> oh well
[03:54:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/7/
[03:54:47] <Cork> prawnosun: well 2 doesn't behave at all as it is broken :)
[03:55:09] <Cork> but /5 does very little behavior change to what that code instructs
[03:55:32] <Cork> basically it replaces .empty with .val('') and moves the focus effect to css
[03:55:56] <Cork> and it added code to always keep the cursor at first char if the placeholder is shown
[03:56:42] <prawnosun> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/7/ <-- works brilliant. you dont need the cursor business. i can't even remember why you even need it in the first place
[03:57:11] <Cork> prawnosun: as the text is removed on focus you don't have to modify the cursor position
[03:57:19] <Cork> as it is empty
[03:57:43] <Cork> the cursor was needed with 2 - 6 design cause then the placeholder was shown until the user typed
[03:58:32] <prawnosun> i like 7 very much :)
[03:58:41] <prawnosun> will that work with passwords?
[04:00:37] <Cork> no
[04:00:49] <Cork> as passwords show dots and not text
[04:00:57] <Cork> you need to use a separate element to get those to work
[04:01:28] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/10/ <-- password is a problem
[04:01:52] <decx> think about it
[04:01:54] <prawnosun> nasty critters
[04:06:15] <elmcrest> hi all. I have some messy variables with HTML in it to create Elements. https://dpaste.de/9MdR I want to replace that with some nice document.createElement() ... Is there a good way to do so? ... f.e. var div = cE() and then div.class = 'foo' doesn't seem to help much in terms of less code
[04:07:54] <decx> have a contactform endpoint on your server that servers this in a file
[04:08:24] <elmcrest> and another question. If have to problem, when I parse some elements that's always kind of "static" to get to the field. let's say parents().eq(3) ... when I now change some of the markup I obviously can't get the value anymore. Is there a best practice for that?
[04:08:44] <decx> closest() instead of parents
[04:09:35] <elmcrest> decx ok thx for the two answers. to the first, I don't see the benefit with that. Could you tell me a bit more what you mean?
[04:09:56] <elmcrest> and closest() I guess is what I've searched for, thx :)
[04:10:12] <decx> the benefit is not having html in js
[04:10:55] <decx> a html block like this is amaintenence nightmare
[04:11:11] <elmcrest> yeah that's why I try to make it better
[04:11:14] <minimoo1> hey can someone help me please with this issue, i want to hide the element only when i drag out of the browser window ? http://jsfiddle.net/kpnj4orv/1/
[04:11:42] <Cork> elmcrest: i would recommend looking into a template lib
[04:11:48] <Cork> and move this out of js all together
[04:12:02] <elmcrest> Cork do you have a specific lib in mind? :)
[04:12:20] <Cork> mustach, jqote2, understore to name three
[04:12:34] <elmcrest> Cork ok, thx I'll have a look
[04:12:42] <elmcrest> I guess underscore btw
[04:12:57] <Cork> i like jqote2
[04:13:04] <Cork> mainly cause it has a clean syntax
[04:13:24] <Cork> but ya, all three are quite good
[04:15:11] <minimoo1> ?
[04:15:11] <prawnosun> why is it called a shim?
[04:15:38] <Cork> prawnosun: cause it adds a compatibility shim
[04:15:45] <Cork> for browsers that doesn't support the new feature
[04:17:03] <prawnosun> i had to look up definition of "shin" ... new word for me
[04:17:11] <prawnosun> shim rather
[04:21:44] <tirengarfio> I expected this code to change the value of data-foo to bar2: http://jsfiddle.net/x5bdmzmg/ why it is not changing it after Run it?
[04:22:06] <Cork> tirengarfio: .data doesn't update attributes
[04:22:20] <Cork> it pulls data from the data-* attribute if it doesn't know about the key
[04:22:29] <Cork> but it is all handled in a cache in jquery
[04:23:08] <tirengarfio> Cork, thanks, so any way to change it?
[04:23:25] <Cork> tirengarfio: why do you need it in the attribute?
[04:23:33] <decx> probably dont
[04:23:47] <Cork> tirengarfio: you lose quite a bit of features if you do
[04:23:53] <Cork> (like you can only ever store strings)
[04:24:34] <Cork> if you want to select based on them, you should prob use classes instead
[04:27:30] <minimoo1> cork do you know how to detect a file drag out from the browser window
[04:27:31] <minimoo1> ?
[04:27:49] <Cork> minimoo1: don't think you can
[04:28:08] <Cork> but not sure
[04:28:19] <minimoo1> there must be a way to that
[04:28:30] <minimoo1> like in gmail
[04:38:38] <hypfer_office> hello, I need to select a tr whichs parents parent is class ewViewTable and add a td to that tr. how? $("tr").parent().parent([class='ewViewTable']); returns unexpected reserved word
[04:40:22] <minimoo1> wrap class='ewViewTable'  in double qoutes
[04:40:37] <decx> closest()
[04:40:48] <decx> and quotes
[04:41:53] <hypfer_office> okay, it returns the table now
[04:42:00] <hypfer_office> but how do I manipulate the td?
[04:42:12] <hypfer_office> *tr
[04:42:39] <phx> hypfer_office, http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[04:43:01] <hypfer_office> phx: yes, but that will manipulate the parents parent of the tr
[04:43:20] <phx> you first have to select the tr of course
[04:43:22] <hypfer_office> but I want to manipulate the tr which is the child of the child of that
[04:43:49] <decx> huh
[04:44:08] <phx> hypfer_office, what about $('table.ewViewTables td tr') ?
[04:44:17] <decx> yeah you're doing it backwards
[04:44:42] <phx> s/s//
[04:45:26] <hypfer_office> phx $('table.ewViewTable tr').append(something) seems to work. Thanks :)
[04:45:47] <phx> yeah, sorry tr td would have been the right order
[04:46:14] <phx> hypfer_office, basically it's just like the css selectors. "a b c" returns c, which has parent spec b, which has parent spec a, etc
[04:46:31] <decx> tr td is redundant
[04:46:33] <phx> so you can query based on the structure, not just class/id
[04:46:36] <decx> as all td are in tr
[04:47:00] <phx> decx, yeah, but i'm not sure if i want TDs, whether i can omit the Tr part, since that omits a middle element from the tree
[04:47:21] <phx> it's <table><tr><td>, and i dunno whether $('table td') would get that
[04:47:27] <decx> it does
[04:47:28] <phx> but he needed the TRs, so it's fine
[04:47:42] <phx> decx, always learning then :)
[04:47:51] <decx> i bet he needs td though ^^
[04:48:06] <decx> i certainly dont append directly to tr unless it's tds :D
[04:48:27] <decx> then again, i havent traveresed a table in years
[04:49:41] <phx> i have a something where i'm doing a table-like representation (rows, consisting of "icon, name, qty" each), and i'm thinking whether that would be better of as a table, instead of the structure of divs, as it is currently
[04:52:04] <Cork> phx: you should use a table if what you show is tabular data
[04:52:22] <Cork> and it sounds like "yes"
[04:53:09] <hypfer_office> interesting, this $('table.ewViewTable tr').append('<td><img src="img/info.png"/></td>'); works in IE and chrome but not firefox.
[04:53:55] <hypfer_office> same goes for opera
[04:53:59] <Cork> that should work fine in firefox
[04:54:20] <hypfer_office> Cork: how do I debug if it doesn't?
[04:54:45] <decx> open console
[04:54:54] <tirengarfio> Cork, this time Im trying to change the name of the class, but I can't http://jsfiddle.net/x5bdmzmg/2/
[04:55:02] <Cork> hypfer_office: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/eykp2j65/
[04:55:13] <Cork> hypfer_office: start by validating your html
[04:55:22] <phx> hypfer_office, html is not xml
[04:55:39] <decx> use addClass, removeClass, toggleClass
[04:55:45] <Cork> tirengarfio: .removeClass('jander').addClass('clander')
[04:56:01] <decx> toggleClass('jander clander')
[04:56:25] <Cork> not as strict, but ya, can work too
[04:56:33] <Cork> *can also work
[05:02:01] <hypfer_office> Cork: update: ff fails a bit earlier on this " $('a[data-original-title="Edit"').attr('data-original-title','Bearbeiten');" with unrecognized expression. chrome and IE work
[05:02:44] <Cork> your selector is broken
[05:03:00] <Cork> $('a[data-original-title="Edit" <-- missing ]
[05:03:53] <hypfer_office> thanks :)
[05:06:18] <Cork> hypfer_office: it actually scares me a little bit that you didn't get that error in the other browsers...
[05:08:55] <prawnosun> the default html5 placeholder sucks
[05:09:11] <prawnosun> your better off using a script to get consistent feel
[05:09:46] <Cork> prawnosun: interesting, i feel the complete opposite
[05:10:25] <prawnosun> I prefer that on focus it doesn't blank out until keydown
[05:10:48] <prawnosun> Cork: BTW that html5-shim doesn't even work
[05:11:03] <Cork> prawnosun: it was just an example from a quick google
[05:11:13] <Cork> look around there are plenty of them
[05:11:20] <prawnosun> Cork will do
[05:11:31] <Cork> prawnosun: uh... wait
[05:11:43] <Cork> you reverted that right?
[05:11:53] <prawnosun> reverted?
[05:11:57] <Cork> you like it to blank out on focus instead of on keydown
[05:12:07] <Cork> cause that was what you asked for
[05:12:14] <prawnosun> yes i reverted :)
[05:12:32] <prawnosun> I prefer that on focus it doesn't blank out until keydown
[05:12:36] <Cork> prawnosun: placeholders is meant to give the user a hint on what to type
[05:12:44] <Cork> if it is removed as soon as the field is focus
[05:12:46] <Cork> +ed
[05:12:56] <Cork> it makes it confusing for the user
[05:13:09] <Cork> that is why the specs suggest to show it until it isn't blank
[05:13:27] <prawnosun> well html5 should follow the spec!
[05:14:02] <prawnosun> it currently sets to blank out on focus before keydown
[05:14:34] <Cork> uh...
[05:14:34] <Cork> no
[05:14:59] <Cork> prawnosun: your making this very confusing
[05:15:00] <prawnosun> http://jsfiddle.net/Lpnsnhpx/3/
[05:15:11] <prawnosun> thats the default behaviour
[05:15:19] <prawnosun> the one you made
[05:15:23] <Cork> prawnosun: firefox, chrome and ie shows the placeholder until the fields isn't empty
[05:15:32] <prawnosun> it blanks out on focus before keydown
[05:15:32] <Cork> sure
[05:15:35] <Cork> no
[05:16:18] <prawnosun> yes when you click on it it blanks out
[05:16:24] <Cork> also that isn't the one i made
[05:16:27] <Cork> no it doesn't
[05:16:43] <prawnosun> move cursor to input, click on it, and it goes blank
[05:16:45] <Cork> what browser are you using?
[05:16:49] <prawnosun> IE11
[05:17:42] <prawnosun> Cork: we both right. works in chrone, not in IE11
[05:18:59] <prawnosun> IE really does suck a bunch
[05:19:09] <lilsammy> +1 for IE sucks
[05:19:26] <Cork> prawnosun: can't reproduce
[05:19:43] <Cork> ie11 does exactly the same as firefox, chrome and safari here
[05:19:54] <Cork> except it shows an x button to remove what you have typed
[05:20:12] <Cork> opps
[05:20:14] <Cork> sorry wrong link
[05:20:33] <Cork> hmm interesting
[05:20:39] <Cork> haven't tested this in quite a while
[05:20:51] <Cork> and i was quite sure it behaved differently in ie10
[05:20:58] <Cork> not a biggie
[05:21:19] <prawnosun> now trying to find a script to get it to work for all
[05:21:45] <prawnosun> though that one you suggested listed #1, but doesn't even work
[05:21:51] <Cork> prawnosun: or just let the browser do what the user is used to
[05:23:14] <Cork> ah, interesting
[05:23:24] <Cork> they have softened the criterias in the spec
[05:23:39] <Cork> "User agents should present this hint to the user, after having stripped line breaks from it, when the element's value is the empty string, especially if the control is not focused."
[05:24:03] <Cork> opps wrong line
[05:24:14] <Cork> meant "If a user agent normally doesn't show this hint to the user when the control is focused, then the user agent should nonetheless show the hint for the control if it was focused as a result of the autofocus attribute, since in that case the user will not have had an opportunity to examine the control before focusing it."
[05:24:43] <Rprp`> Hi guys, I am currently using jQuery mobile but I am having a weird bug. Sometimes, not always, when I use a <input type=submit> it changes the url to the file, instead of the attached parameters. Example: when I call test.php?para=1 it posts to test.php instead of test.php?para=1. How can I fix this? Even when I specify an action tag in the form.
[05:44:21] <prawnosun> dont even bother trying placeholders in jQuery dialog :)
[05:44:53] <prawnosun> It won't work properly in IE < 10 even with shim
[05:52:26] <e\bola> Hi, I'm working with a Getac tablet and I must catch the paste event from a barcode scanner
[05:52:37] <e\bola> I tried with the change and paste events
[05:53:01] <e\bola> But still it doesn't see the input from the scanner
[05:53:51] <e\bola> It's a simple input form focused in which the barcode scanned is written
[05:53:59] <e\bola> I need to catch that event
[05:56:23] <tirengarfio> change() for an input is changeing elements, values, etc.. when I place the cursor in another input, so how to make the change while the cursor is inside the input?
[05:56:24] <e\bola> Uhm, found. It's working using the "input" event
[05:56:44] <hypfer_office> Cork: yeah, I don't think that it's a "smart" behaviour to just run that without informing me
[05:57:08] <e\bola> But now it's just writing some numbers, not all
[05:57:13] <e\bola> maybe with a timeout
[05:58:44] <e\bola> Ok, it's wroking.
[05:58:47] <e\bola> working.
[06:05:40] <Cork> hypfer_office: what they do is somehow error correct the selector
[06:06:50] <hypfer_office> interestingly enough even the IE now has an inspector
[06:07:07] <Cork> ie10+ has a quite ok inspector
[06:09:02] <dieck> Hi there. Is there any second label in jquery mobile for input fields? I need to provide a field title, input field and after that another text, like unit of measurement or iso standard expected in the field

[06:25:53] <blue_warlock> hello
[06:26:18] <blue_warlock> how can i let .load() works with parametric strings ?
[06:26:57] <blue_warlock> querystrings
[06:27:22] <blue_warlock> $("#wrap").load("/calcolo.asp?action=calcola" + ' ' + "#calcolo");
[06:27:42] <blue_warlock> having trouble with this
[06:28:18] <Cork> blue_warlock: that should work
[06:28:25] <blue_warlock> it doesnt
[06:28:44] <blue_warlock> if i set /calcolo.asp in the link it works
[06:28:47] <Cork> does the selector match in the returned html?
[06:28:52] <blue_warlock> yes
[06:29:01] <blue_warlock> but the page is loaded without parameters
[06:29:02] <Cork> you sure?
[06:29:10] <blue_warlock> yes
[06:29:17] <Cork> is the server expecting a post then?
[06:29:30] <blue_warlock> it loads only the part /calcolo.asp without the aciton
[06:29:38] <blue_warlock> yes
[06:29:40] <Cork> then it is a server problem
[06:29:45] <Cork> .load always does .get
[06:29:55] <Cork> so you can't use .load if you need post
[06:30:20] <blue_warlock> do you mean i have to use get ?
[06:30:44] <blue_warlock> if i got parametric string will it work ?
[06:30:46] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { data: { action: 'calcola' } }).done(function(data) { $('#wrap').html(data); })
[06:31:01] <Cork> blue_warlock: .load does a get call
[06:31:11] <Cork> if you need post use $.ajax or $.post
[06:31:28] <blue_warlock> ah
[06:31:49] <blue_warlock> how become with ajax ?
[06:32:13] <sayhi> Cork any idea why .submit doesn work.. but #submit.click works here?
[06:32:14] <Cork> i gave you that...
[06:32:14] <sayhi> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b30a35f2f8c33b6ac64a
[06:32:56] <sayhi> #submitbutton.click
[06:33:09] <Cork> sayhi: there is no submit button there
[06:33:11] <Cork> =
[06:33:12] <Cork> *?
[06:33:20] <blue_warlock> but what is data ?
[06:33:27] <sayhi> i know
[06:33:35] <sayhi> it works with submitbutton.click

[06:33:45] <Cork> blue_warlock: ^
[06:34:03] <Cork> sayhi: the code you show doens't match the question you ask
[06:34:27] <sayhi> Cork - it does.. just the button missing
[06:34:37] <Cork> your binding click to radio buttons
[06:34:44] <Cork> and ask about click on submit
[06:34:56] <sayhi> i want the form to submit on radio click
[06:35:03] <PatBateman> hi, anyone has a hint, why my select list doesnt work inside a jquery ui sortable?
[06:35:08] <sayhi> form.submit() doesnt work.. button.click does
[06:35:22] <Cork> is form a dom element or jquery object?
[06:35:51] <sayhi> the form id
[06:35:59] <sayhi> as in the code..
[06:36:01] <Cork> what?
[06:36:04] <sayhi> it doesnt work like that
[06:37:12] <sayhi> any reason why the code i show wouldnt work?
[06:37:56] <Cork> sayhi: http://jsfiddle.net/54ykgdpr/
[06:38:39] <sayhi> Cork: so why isnt mine working?
[06:38:48] <sayhi> according to jquery docs.. it should
[06:38:49] <blue_warlock> boh
[06:38:50] <Cork> donno i haven't see yours
[06:39:39] <sayhi> k, thx
[06:39:56] <blue_warlock> i need to load the #calcolo into #wrap after posting
[06:45:02] <Cork> blue_warlock: the best option is to have the server only send the part you need
[06:45:34] <Cork> blue_warlock: alternatively you can hack around and grab the part from the full document client side (though this is, and always will be a dirty hack)
[06:46:19] <Cork> dirty in the form that it depends on the browsers error correction to try to grab content from a full page as a fragment
[06:46:58] <abailarri> Hello. I have a question. I use a click function to add on div to my html. In the script I have another clock function asociated with the new created div, but this second click function not triggers. Any suggestion?
[06:47:07] <mooncup> also you're downloading probably more than twice as much html as you need to
[06:47:23] <Cork> abailarri: use delegated event handler
[06:47:27] <Cork> bind it to a static parent
[06:47:54] <Cork> mooncup: depends on the page, but definitely possible
[06:54:22] <abailarri> Cork, how can I do this?
[06:54:41] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com delegate

[07:05:56] <abailarri> Cork, yes I readed, but I not understant
[07:05:58] <Guest23191> yea
[07:06:13] <Cork> Guest23191: window.location.search
[07:06:15] <Guest23191> "calcolo.asp" + querystring
[07:06:36] <Cork> abailarri: you select a parent and bind a delegated event listener to it
[07:06:39] <Guest23191> querystring must return the full querstring
[07:07:00] <Guest23191> ?pip=2&pop=3&pap=4
[07:07:18] <Cork> what?
[07:07:27] <Cork> you want the full query string but not the full query string??
[07:07:31] <Guest23191> the entire querystring in a var
[07:07:43] <Cork> Guest23191: window.location.search <--
[07:07:47] <Cork> that is the full query string
[07:07:52] <Guest23191> ah
[07:07:54] <Guest23191> tks
[07:21:41] <abailarri> Cork, I don't know how to implement with function http://jsfiddle.net/rkmfcpxg/13/
[07:25:58] <dougrchamberlain> is anyone else unable to login to bugs.jquery.com? I can't even reset my password. it will never email me.
[07:26:05] <dmsuperman> abailarri: what are you trying to do and what are you not able to implement?
[07:26:56] <dmsuperman> Oh, I read teh scrollback. abailarri, when you bind an event handler to a selector, it only binds to nodes that exist at the time of the binding
[07:27:20] <abailarri> dmsuperman, and there is not way to do something?
[07:27:23] <dmsuperman> If you want to get around that, bind to the document (or the closest parent node) which always exists, and use a selector on the bind
[07:27:37] <dmsuperman> $(document).on('click', '.some-selector', function...
[07:27:47] <dmsuperman> is like $('.some-selector').on('click'...
[07:28:03] <dmsuperman> except the former will work on nodes created after the binding
[07:28:22] <dmsuperman> albeit at a slight performance hit. it's better to use a parent <div> instead of document if you can
[07:29:15] <abailarri> dmsuperman, http://jsfiddle.net/rkmfcpxg/17/
[07:29:21] <abailarri> I think this is the way?
[07:33:58] <Zelest> how can I append() something to a <select> unless it already exists? :o
[07:34:07] <Zelest> something = a option
[07:35:18] <NoiseEee> Zelest: what?
[07:35:33] <NoiseEee> Zelest: create the <select> too?  i mean, what kind of question is that
[07:36:03] <Zelest> I have two selects.. and depending on the first one, the second one will have different options..
[07:36:59] <Zelest> so i basically use remove() and append(), but in some situations it adds the same options twice.. so I wanted to add that option unless it already existsed.
[07:37:16] <NoiseEee> so look to see if it exists first i suppose
[07:37:50] <Zelest> Erm
[07:37:55] <Zelest> I just realize how retarded my question was..
[07:38:00] <Zelest> Yeah, shysh.. I'm tired. :(
[07:38:12] * Zelest goes back to his corner in shame
[07:38:25] <dmsuperman> abailarri: you could certainly try and see :P
[07:38:29] <dmsuperman> abailarri: but that looks good to me
[07:38:43] <abailarri> dmsuperman, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rkmfcpxg/20/
[07:38:59] <dmsuperman> yep! even better
[07:39:16] <dmsuperman> since you're using a smaller slice of the DOM to bind to the performance hit isn't as bad as $(document)
[07:47:04] <abailarri> dmsuperman, works well but in the real page, no http://jsfiddle.net/suktrLqz/
[07:47:27] <abailarri> when I click icon-remove, it don't do anything
[07:48:33] <Almis90> abailarri put also the html
[07:50:02] <abailarri> Almis90, dmsuperman http://jsfiddle.net/suktrLqz/1/
[07:55:14] <abailarri> Almis90, dmsuperman better this http://jsfiddle.net/suktrLqz/4/
[07:55:42] <Almis90> abailarri wait i will show you small example
[07:58:23] <dmsuperman> abailarri: 1: you'rem issing a ); at the end of your fiddle
[07:58:27] <dmsuperman> 2: you're missing jquery library
[07:58:33] <dmsuperman> when I fix those issues, the click works fine
[07:58:37] <Almis90> abailarri http://jsfiddle.net/suktrLqz/6/
[07:58:48] <dmsuperman> use your js console to see javascript errors, I bet you're getting errros on your actual page
[08:01:53] <abailarri> Almis90, works fine
[08:15:27] <hlfw0rd> If someone clicks on an anchor tag inside an li tag, I want to append some content to the li tag. How can I access the current li item?
[08:15:43] <hlfw0rd> from within a $('li a').on('click call
[08:17:09] <Almis90> hlfw0rd $('li a').click(function(){$(this).parent().append('something')})
[08:17:14] <shoky> $(this).closest('li')
[08:17:19] <hlfw0rd> thanks guys
[08:18:09] <dmsuperman> closest being better than $this.parent()
[08:19:10] <Almis90> dmsuperman is faster?
[08:19:22] <shoky> better
[08:19:25] <darir> Yeah I would assume .parent() is actually faster..
[08:19:28] <decx> it's less frail
[08:19:33] <Almis90> why better
[08:19:37] <Almis90> dont see reason
[08:19:42] <shoky> .parent() is for direct parent only
[08:19:46] <decx> you can change markup a bit without affecting closest
[08:20:22] <Almis90> shoky well li is direct parent of a so its okay
[08:20:43] <Almis90> and faster as darir said
[08:20:45] <shoky> for now it's a direct parent. with .closest you don't need to care
[08:20:54] <shoky> and they are both fast enough
[08:20:58] <shoky> so, closest is better.
[08:21:14] <shoky> still, use whatever you want ;p
[08:33:00] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/uy2yr/42/
[08:33:22] <P0rk> Could someone help with .siblings().next() and or .before and .after?
[08:33:54] <decx> the hell is siblings().next() supposed to do?
[08:34:20] <P0rk> when a checkbox is checked for the first time in this table, I want to append a row after the row with the selected checkbox
[08:34:37] <P0rk> then, every time it's checked or unchecked, I want to hide it.
[08:34:50] <P0rk> or show it as it were. lol
[08:34:52] <decx> siblings() is a collection of all the elements on the same level as your fortmfield
[08:34:59] <P0rk> right
[08:35:02] <P0rk> rows
[08:35:29] <P0rk> I need to add a row after the selected row, so siblings().next() I thought might give the next sibling of the row selectied
[08:36:05] <P0rk> to check to see if it's a detailField. If so, it's already been checked once....if not, add it
[08:36:08] <decx> the next row of your changed closest fortmfield is jsut next
[08:36:44] <Almis90> P0rk to show/hide just use .toggle()
[08:37:16] <P0rk> Almis90, thanks. I am actually going to add/remove a c lass to use css animations.
[08:37:28] <P0rk> this is just to get the process ironed out
[08:39:14] <P0rk> field.after($("<tr")) puts the tr after the field, correct?
[08:39:22] <Almis90> P0rk I think what you need to is to append detailTable to $(this).closest('tr')
[08:39:40] <Almis90> so it will append the table udner the row
[08:40:23] <P0rk> so, how do I do that? appendTo() in the middle of a table?>

[08:41:08] <fonko> guys... is it possible to define a selector in real time? i mean... i have this code: http://pastebin.com/RMfuRVua
[08:41:23] <ashgotti> I need to add the prefix outside of the field so it's not part of the value
[08:41:32] <fonko> so i depend on a click to figure out the second function id that will be whatching for a click
[08:42:03] <P0rk> appendTo just appends to the end of the table Almis90
[08:42:43] <Almis90> P0rk you want to add the table under the row of checked checkbox right?
[08:42:51] <fonko> so in order to have $('#'+ idLink + 'button') working i need a previous click to be done by the user... i cant wrap my head around this
[08:42:54] <P0rk> yep
[08:43:22] <Almis90> change fld.before(det); to fld.after(det);
[08:44:16] <P0rk> uggh. Thanks for your help. .before and .after suck
[08:44:25] <P0rk> they totally seem backward to me
[08:44:35] <Almis90> now to hide the table just write fld.next().hide()
[08:45:16] <Almis90> http://jsfiddle.net/uy2yr/47/
[08:45:25] <Almis90> is that what you wanted?
[08:47:04] <decx> btw your labels are useless if you dont for
[08:48:35] <P0rk> decx, I know. I have to serialize the form elements
[08:48:43] <P0rk> then I can add IDs and fors
[08:49:33] <fonko> guys i need help
[08:50:14] <fonko> i cant make this work http://pastebin.com/RMfuRVua
[08:50:49] <fonko> scond jquery event handler wont work because i need to define the value of my id according to a previous click im doing
[08:51:08] <decx> it doesnt wait to go through the js until somebody clicked the first thing
[08:51:20] <decx> idLink will always be empty
[08:51:43] <fonko> thats right... so how can i define my second selector
[08:51:52] <fonko> after doing click
[08:52:02] <fonko> something like promise().done() ?
[08:52:18] <decx> i have no idea what you'Re even doing
[08:52:27] <fonko> haha
[08:52:51] <fonko> its a mess with jquery mobile... the thing is that a closing cross isn't working so im trying to hack it
[08:53:06] <decx> oh jqm. goodbye
[08:53:29] <fonko> :(
[08:53:56] <decx> you can set your second click bind inside the first click
[08:55:41] <fonko> can you plz refactor that code fast? to see what do you mean by bind
[08:56:37] <fonko> http://pastebin.com/RMfuRVua
[09:24:27] <HardFu> how can I observe body for dynamic insertion of a div with a class, then log it out?
[09:25:16] <robertmaxrees> you can use mutation observers, but I'd highly suggest against it.
[09:26:00] <robertmaxrees> see if there isn't a callback or something similar you can use instead.
[09:27:07] <HardFu> yeah, just tried to de-duplicate some code
[10:05:24] <katsh_> When i stop a form from submitting with e.preventDefault, how do i later resume submission?
[10:06:22] <robertmaxrees> use http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ to send along extra parameters and check those in your handler.
[10:06:40] <robertmaxrees> if they're not present, prevent default.  if they ARE present, continue like normal.
[10:17:25] <katsh_> robertmaxrees: i simply removed e.preventDefault and put return true/false depending on validation.
[10:17:45] <katsh_> seems to be working. if all validations pass, i $(this).submit() else return false
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> do the preventDefault() instead of returning true of false.
[10:18:09] <robertmaxrees> *or false
[10:18:29] <robertmaxrees> the idea is to be explicit.  you're basically using a side effect of the handler otherwise.
[10:18:57] <katsh_> thanks
[10:19:00] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[10:19:29] <MikeD_> is it possible to have a drop-down that isn't 'selected' such that $('#myselect').children(':selected') could return null - or can i safely use $('#myselect').children(':selected').text()  ?
[10:20:12] <robertmaxrees> you can try the latter, but i'd attach some kind of .data() to the node that you update on change.
[10:23:44] <decx> this.selectedOptions[0].innerHTML
[10:25:09] <robertmaxrees> decx http://jsfiddle.net/jxjsLv41/
[10:25:19] <robertmaxrees> that returns whatever the the "default" one is.
[10:25:37] <decx> well duh
[10:25:38] <decx> on change
[10:26:29] <robertmaxrees> dude wanted to be able to get get null out of an unselected one was the point i thought.
[10:26:41] <decx> didnt read that far up
[10:26:57] <MikeD_> no, i just didn't want the .text() method to yell at me if nobody had selected anything
[10:27:10] <MikeD_> but i wouldn't expect that you could create that situation
[10:27:37] <MikeD_> because even without specifically setting something to selected, there's always _something_ visible as the selected option on a select
[10:28:11] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ yep - jquery generally checks for you before continuing on and breaking stuff.
[10:28:22] <MikeD_> oh, that's good
[10:41:38] <Tomashe> Hey guys i have an object what when i console log i get that : Object {104: Object, 105: Object, 106: Object, 108: Object, 109: Object, 110: Object, 111: Object, 112: Object, 113: Object} but when i do console.log(object.length) i get undefined , any ideas?
[10:41:50] <robertmaxrees> because objects don't have a length
[10:41:52] <robertmaxrees> arrays do.
[10:42:08] <arthurvr> objects don't have a length property
[10:42:15] <arthurvr> only array objects and strings
[10:42:20] <BillCriswell> Objects don't have a length.
[10:42:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:42:32] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:42:37] <BillCriswell> arrays do.
[10:42:40] <Tomashe> so how do i count the sub objects inside
[10:42:46] <Tomashe> elements*
[10:42:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5533192/how-to-get-object-length
[10:42:58] <arthurvr> Object.keys(obj).length ?
[10:42:59] <robertmaxrees> or use an array.
[10:42:59] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: You can do like.. Object.key(foo).length perhaps?
[10:43:13] <BillCriswell> Objects don't have a length.
[10:43:27] <arthurvr> I think objects don't have a length
[10:43:28] <nettoweb> is there a way to do a $.ajax at a URL and extract the responseText after all html are loaded? because the target website uses a lot of JS to inject html in their page
[10:43:34] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr you're correct.
[10:43:53] <Tomashe> ok i will try tobertmaxrees link, thank you all guys , appriciate the help
[10:44:04] <robertmaxrees> arrays have a magical length property, plain objects do not without Object.keys(myObject).length, but that's not supported in IE8.
[10:44:21] <arthurvr> There are quite good polyfills for Object.keys
[10:44:32] <robertmaxrees> yep, like the one on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[10:44:43] <arthurvr> jup
[10:45:36] <arthurvr> How do you guys handle polyfills this days? Just googling around and inserting in codebase?
[10:45:59] <robertmaxrees> we're using underscore and leaning on that.
[10:45:59] <arthurvr> Asking cause https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service is nice
[10:46:16] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'd use ljharb's
[10:47:05] <nettoweb> ?
[10:47:27] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim this one.
[10:47:36] <arthurvr> oh yeah cool one
[10:48:02] <arthurvr> you just load in all or copy-paste when needed?
[10:48:27] <robertmaxrees> right now we're just using underscore, but I'd include all of the es5 one if I needed it.
[10:48:33] <robertmaxrees> it does all that work for ou.
[10:50:02] <frank_o> Hi! Is there an easy way to add a `destroy` method to https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/blob/v2.0.0-rc1/src/snap.js? Gotta make it work across multiple jQuery Mobile pages: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/phpyf0ws/5/
[10:53:22] <BillCriswell> frank_o: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23875815/how-to-use-snap-js-panels-with-jquery-mobile ?
[10:54:42] <frank_o> BillCriswell: yes sir! but it doesn't account for when you change to a different jqm page
[11:06:24] <fonko> something is messing with my events...
[11:06:32] <fonko> with clicks
[11:07:03] <fonko> in jquery mobile.... i have a selector that i need to click two times or it ruin all the rest of clicks in the page...
[11:07:21] <fonko> and its not some overlay thing... there is something else
[11:19:39] <Respek> hi all :)
[11:22:50] <Respek> question: If the structure is section#home-hero > div.row > div.small-12-columns > h1; in terms of best use of jquery, is this the most efficient/accurate use way to find the h1? $('#home-hero').find('h1').attr('data-top','0');
[11:23:43] <Respek> it looks like it at least, from the docs
[11:25:25] <frank_o> Respek: r u using grids or something?
[11:25:26] <NoiseEee> Respek: that's seeing the "data-top" attribute to '0', of the h1, is that what you want?
[11:25:33] <NoiseEee> s/seeing/setting
[11:25:52] <NoiseEee> or are you looking for the h1 with the attribute data-top=0?
[11:25:56] <Respek> that is indeed what I was hoping to do
[11:26:09] <NoiseEee> Respek: so that should be fine; mind you it will set it for *all* the h1s found
[11:26:42] <Respek> right. and thought that's not a problem, if I wanted to fix that problem, I could use the nth child selector correct?
[11:26:47] <Respek> *though
[11:26:59] <NoiseEee> or just /get/filter/first()/ etc
[11:27:08] <NoiseEee> but yeah
[11:27:23] <frank_o> Respek: id start off writing some cleaner html. grids are good for graphic design and architecture, but why some people see the need to transfer them programatically onto their html and css is beyond me. especially when regular css and media queries will do just fine.
[11:27:25] <Respek> great, I'm going to look that up before
[11:27:32] <andrew_r> is $('#home-hero').find('h1') really better than $('#home-hero h1') ?
[11:27:56] <Respek> andrew_r:  that was my first thought. the docs showed me the way I proposed
[11:28:08] <NoiseEee> andrew_r: i'd imagine its about the same amount of work / 6 half-dozen etc
[11:28:44] <frank_o> Respek: also http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[11:28:52] <Respek> frank_o: personally, it helps me with responsive design
[11:29:02] <Respek> frank_o: thanks, I'll read that now
[11:29:53] <frank_o> Respek: my app is super responsive too but im using clean html + media queries (and https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js/ for JS media queries)
[11:29:59] <Respek> frank_o: also, truth is, that it was actually small-100-columns, but I figured I'd catch so much shit for that, that I decided to censor that part.
[11:30:27] <Respek> learned about enquire.js recently. seems powerful at first glance
[11:30:34] <frank_o> ha
[11:30:43] <frank_o> Yep seemed a little bit better than that other one
[11:31:30] <Respek> frank_o: any resources you could link to that would represent that thought process?
[11:31:32] <frank_o> the one that Paul Irish & crew did
[11:32:58] <Respek> interesting link there from css tricks frank_o. thanks for sharing
[11:33:19] <frank_o> Respek: not really, although I think it's more like a lack of thought process that illustrates why one would choose to skip grids in html/css
[11:33:42] <frank_o> "perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away" or whatever they say
[11:33:43] <Respek> ah
[11:33:51] <Respek> lovely quote
[11:34:06] <Respek> quite a beautiful concept IMO
[11:34:07] <frank_o> wait i think i got one - http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
[11:34:16] <frank_o> oh indeed
[11:35:47] <Respek> frank_o: fantasic
[12:35:32] <Guest81121> hey guys
[12:35:42] <Guest81121> anyone knows why i'm getting this error?
[12:35:47] <Guest81121> everything seems fine to me
[12:35:49] <Guest81121> http://gyazo.com/4866b623cff14f7d1c5272037f5ee7be
[12:36:06] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use something before it's defined.
[12:37:47] <Guest81121> how do i fix it then?
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> define the function you're trying to use.
[12:38:04] <Kartagis> hi
[12:38:32] <_MysT> Weird Mobile (android) Issue:    http://gildedsocial.com/       Body { background-image: *** }     not loading within Chrome or Default Browser in Android only (Firefox works)  -   Does anyone have any clue on this?   Can't seem to get the background image to load at all!!
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> Guest81121 there should be a line number all the way to the right that tells you where things are failing, unless the issue only happens when you paste that $.get() call in manually./
[12:39:19] <Kartagis> http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/challenges/7 <--- in this level, he says to add a button, then remove another. how is this different than setting val() and an addClass?
[12:39:20] <Guest81121> only happens when i paste it manually
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> Guest81121 try to do $.fn.jquery - does this throw an error?
[12:41:06] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis two different ways to modify the document.
[12:41:30] <Guest81121> i'm running the script in google chrome developer console
[12:41:34] <Guest81121> so fn is undefined
[12:41:45] <Kartagis> but thet server the same purpose, right?
[12:41:51] <Kartagis> they*
[12:41:54] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis without watching everything else, i dunno.
[12:42:00] <robertmaxrees> Guest81121 right, becuase jquery isn't loaded on the page.
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> so $.get() won't work.
[12:42:17] <Kartagis> okay
[12:42:45] <Guest81121> is there a way to load jquery manually in any page i want?
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> Guest81121 there are plugins/extensions that'll do that, sure.
[12:45:55] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis to clarify - there's a distinction between adding/removing elements and changing classes. depending on the use case, there can be actual differences in how the code works.
[12:46:04] <Kartagis> hrm
[12:46:08] <Kartagis> okay
[12:46:13] <robertmaxrees> in this case, it looks like you're removing a button and adding a <p> tag, right?
[12:52:04] <Kartagis> robertAway: nope, adding a button, removing another
[12:52:22] <Kartagis> but they are at the same position
[13:05:37] <jeffszusz> hey guys - what's the most efficient way (if there is one) to select all parents with a particular css style attribute?
[13:06:05] <jdummy> Anyone know if .data() can be seen in the console?... e.g. $(this).data('myData', 'testing123'); console.log($(this)); ... is "testing123" somewhere in the console?  I can't find it
[13:06:08] <jeffszusz> i don't care what the value is, just that it has the style defined
[13:06:15] <jdummy> jeffszusz: closest()
[13:06:47] <jeffszusz> jdummy, would i do [style*="text-align"] as my selector?
[13:07:00] <jdummy> jeffszusz: that looks right
[13:07:15] <BillCriswell> jeffszusz: You can do like... $el.parents().filter(function(){ return $(this).css('textAlign') === 'right'; });
[13:07:24] <jdummy> it might be particular about single versus double-quotes
[13:07:45] <Savish> Hey all, I need some help - I posted a question on stack, its a bit in-depth: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26223060/unexpected-results-with-a-menu-at-different-browser-sizes, my question is - essentially - how would I achieve what I am trying to achieve with the panel leaving and coming back using both css and jQuery? Should I use two panels? should I check when there is browser resize? Could some one post a fiddle of how you would
[13:07:46] <Savish> properly accomplish this?
[13:08:40] <jdummy> jeffszusz: closest() wins in my browser (Chrome 37) http://jsperf.com/jquery-parents-vs-closest/2
[13:08:42] <BillCriswell> jeffszusz: If they actually have style attributes you can pass that selector to .parents().
[13:08:51] <BillCriswell> closest would only return 1 element.
[13:09:48] <jdummy> BillCriswell, jeffszusz: oh yeah, they don't accomplish the same thing
[13:18:41] <Savish> Hey all, I need some help - I posted a question on stack, its a bit in-depth: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26223060/unexpected-results-with-a-menu-at-different-browser-sizes, my question is - essentially - how would I achieve what I am trying to achieve with the panel leaving and coming back using both css and jQuery?

[13:18:41] <Savish> properly accomplish this?
[13:22:51] <frees> is it possible to read the innerHTML of a domain from a different domain?
[13:24:59] <jdummy> Savish: I just posted your answer
[13:25:19] <Savish> Ok I will take a look
[13:25:22] <Savish> thank you
[13:25:39] <frees> i need help accessing an api
[13:25:48] <jdummy> Savish: you're welcome
[13:26:33] <Savish> jdummy,  one small issue, while I would love to learn css animation and transitions - as thats what you suggested in your post - what about browsers that don't support this feature, how they still get that responsive feeling?
[13:26:36] <Savish> or can they?
[13:27:31] <Savish> And also because I use click events, how can the user still click with out being redirected (or having the url change to "#") when triggering these events?
[13:28:43] <decx> Savish some people like to use animation() fallbacks but browsers that doesnt support css transition or animation are better served without any fluff anyway
[13:29:08] <decx> it's still going to have the .active class and be shown
[13:30:04] <Savish> Oh ok. Can I ask - I am a visual learner, if some one could create a small fiddle showing how I might accomplish this? doesn't have to be the direct answer but an example I could work off of to underrstand the concept here would be awesome.
[13:33:13] <andrew_r> Savish: RE: And also because I use click events, how can the user still click with out being redirected (or having the url change to "#") when triggering these events? -- call event.preventDefault(); to prevent the browser from handling the default behavior (sending the user to #)
[13:33:41] <Savish> So I have a feeling a lot of this is actually still using jQuery?
[13:33:48] <Savish> hence my asking for a fiddle
[13:33:51] <Savish> cause I'm a bit lost now
[13:34:07] <jdummy> Savish: just don't use an anchor <a> for your "open" button.  make it a div
[13:34:12] <jdummy> it's not a real link anyways
[13:34:19] <robertAway> or use a <button>
[13:34:27] <andrew_r> example: $('a').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); // rest of your code });
[13:34:38] <andrew_r> I don't have an example for the animation you are asking about
[13:34:43] <Savish> andrew_r,  Its in relation to my stack question I ask
[13:35:04] <jdummy> Savish: simply google "css transitions"... no one wants to do your "homework" for you, but we're willing to help you learn
[13:35:06] <krambiorix> hi, i want my rows to slide down, but that doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/kodnye7b/
[13:35:06] <Savish> andrew_r, jdummy commented on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26223060/unexpected-results-with-a-menu-at-different-browser-sizes and I am now confused am I doing this with pure css or ..
[13:35:14] <Savish> its not home work
[13:35:27] <Savish> regardless am I doing this with pure css transitions or jQuery
[13:35:31] <Savish> thats what I'm confused on
[13:35:57] <jdummy> Savish: I didn't mean it literally.  Either way, providing a canned solution does the work for you.  Teaching a man to fish is always preferred over doing their fishing for them every time they need it.
[13:36:00] <krambiorix> jdummy anyidea?
[13:36:34] <jdummy> krambiorix: animation won't work well on tables or table cells
[13:36:45] <Savish> jdummy,  But I don't know how I'm doing this css transitions or jQuery? also not all mobile browsers support css transitions and animations (last I cheked) ....
[13:36:52] <Savish> this seems a bit sketchy
[13:37:27] <jdummy> Savish: mobile browsers are more up-to-date than desktops... CSS transition support should be no problem
[13:37:39] <jdummy> It's not sketchy, it's the way it's typically done
[13:37:52] <nikfluff> what they said ^
[13:38:00] <nikfluff> just for some extra cents~
[13:38:12] <decx> animation() is a great battery eater on mobile
[13:38:17] <decx> transition is easy and fast
[13:38:21] <krambiorix> jdummy, is there any way?
[13:38:40] <jdummy> krambiorix: you can wrap each cell's contents in a <div>, and do your animation on the <div>
[13:38:59] <jdummy> krambiorix: or you can abandon the table and make the entire grid out of <div>s
[13:39:20] <Savish> I still don't feel comfortable using this, but I will try it out. Its very important it works in every smart phone and tablets browser.
[13:39:25] <Savish> thanks guys
[13:39:26] <jdummy> krambiorix: OR... just don't do it.  Not all animation is good.  Sometimes it's nice for the initial impact, but gets tired quickly
[13:40:29] <robertmaxrees> Savish you don't want "every" one.  you want all the *major* ones.
[13:41:45] <Savish> this also doesn't work in IE 9 which is another issue, I can develop this app for 10+ but people under 9 are screwed if they work with their browser at half or lower size
[13:41:47] <nikfluff> i'm still kind of confused as to what the issue was Savish but it seems like the information in the answers (particularly the bottom one) is legit
[13:42:02] <stan_man_can> I'm trying to run some code when a radio box is clicked and for some reason it's not execting on my page. $("input[type=radio]").click(function(){ alert("hiiii"); });
[13:42:12] <nikfluff> if you are using jquery 'at one browser size' and css to 'pick up the slack' that is sort of a recipe for frustration, depending on what you are trying to do
[13:42:14] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can use change.
[13:42:16] <robertmaxrees> not click
[13:42:27] <robertmaxrees> also, is the element added after the page loads?
[13:42:57] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: ha, that's it. Thanks :( Sorry, feels like today must be monday
[13:42:59] <nikfluff> css would be ideal to use first as someone mentioned above, with jquery animations to fall back on. but if you are set on using jquery, then use all jquery and make sure your CSS's specificity (if you do not know that term, google it) is not conflicting with your jquery
[13:43:01] <nikfluff> Savish: ^
[13:43:07] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: must use live
[13:43:18] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can use .on()
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> not live.
[13:43:31] <stan_man_can> that'd be the one
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> and bind to the change event, not the click.
[13:43:40] <Savish> theirs nothing conflicting. its just as others have stated jQuery is overriding the css styles proving default styles from acting as they should
[13:43:43] <Savish> while their answer makes sense
[13:43:45] <Savish> it seems off
[13:43:50] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: thank you good sir
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can fsho
[13:44:03] <nikfluff> > its just as others have stated jQuery is overriding the css styles
[13:44:05] <nikfluff> i would consider that a conflict
[13:44:23] <nikfluff> and it is true, you can do quick tests to confirm this by adding !important to the end of your CSS rules
[13:44:29] <nikfluff> it will give them ultimate overriding power
[13:44:35] <nikfluff> it is not advisable to leave this in your final code
[13:45:39] <jdummy> nikfluff: unfortunately !important will not override an inline style declaration
[13:45:51] <nikfluff> ah yeah true
[13:46:28] <nikfluff> maybe for a quick test to determine if that is your problem, open your example page and use inspector to change the generated 'inline' values
[13:46:45] <nikfluff> or mess with them there and then work out how to make sure css/js plays nicely
[13:47:03] <jdummy> Savish: basically, calling .hide() causes jquery to actually add 'style="display: none"' onto the tag... once that happens, none of your CSS works anymore... an inline style attribute also has no way of representing media queries (a.k.a. responsive)
[13:47:41] <nikfluff> i have not tested this, but a quick google says it is possible to override inline styles from the ssheet :o prob useful at least for testing / debugging http://css-tricks.com/override-inline-styles-with-css/
[13:47:49] <nikfluff> i've never seen that utilized before though
[13:48:02] <andrew_r> !important will override inline or jQuery set styles: http://jsfiddle.net/aqxLq08d/1/
[13:48:07] <jdummy> there's no need to test.  Simply replace the hide() show() calls with .addClass('active') and removeClass('active'), and rework your responsive CSS to make it hide/show when appropriate.
[13:48:29] <nikfluff> ya, you could also change css values with jquery fairly easily
[13:48:42] <jdummy> Savish: if you want to add animation, just use margin-left to show/hide it and set a transition: 1s
[13:48:55] <nikfluff> thanks andrew_r
[13:50:07] <jdummy> andrew_r: thanks for correcting me.  I wouldn't recommend that approach though... ! important is a really bad idea
[13:50:48] <nikfluff> for sure, but for testing and debugging it is rather handy
[13:53:12] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: So right now I'm using $("input[type='radio']").on("click", function(){}); and still no luck on live elements
[13:53:26] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees $("input[type='radio']").on("change ", function(){}); ***
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can you need to change the method signature - $(parent).on('change', 'input[type='radio']', function() {});
[13:54:28] <robertmaxrees> where parent is the element you're appending stuff to.
[13:55:19] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: I'm checking a few values on the event and if they all pass I'm enabling the submit button
[13:55:36] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't change what i just said hahaha
[13:55:39] <stan_man_can> so then I'd do $("#submit").on("change", 'input[type='radio']
[13:55:40] <stan_man_can> right ?
[13:55:45] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> if #submit is the element you're adding the inputs to.
[13:56:10] <stan_man_can> I don't quite follow when you say adding inputs
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i asked earlier if you're adding the radios after the page loads.
[13:57:04] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: ahh I gotcha
[13:57:13] <stan_man_can> sorry I think we're on the same page now :P
[13:59:56] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: There we go :)
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events this is a good guide btw
[14:01:15] <dorian> currently looking at this wontfix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13092 - found a similar problem (so far in ff and chrome) when the host page is application/xhtml+xml
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> dorian but is it the same issue?
[14:02:43] <dorian> it's related
[14:03:10] <robertmaxrees> namespace issue in XML?
[14:03:42] <dorian> if the document is understood by the browser to be xhtml, new elements have to be made with createElementNS
[14:03:56] <dorian> otherwise they are subclasses of Element, not HTMLElement
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> okay - if you wnat to take it up with the devs, check out #jquery-dev instead.
[14:04:01] <dorian> and therefore don't have a .class property
[14:04:08] <dorian> ah, -dev
[14:04:09] <dorian> thanks
[14:24:32] <Poppabear> ok, i am having a hard time getting my code to work as expected, i have a button of type submit, and i have a event handler for the form.submit(function(e) {...}); ... i also have a textarea, and i have an event handler for textarea.keypress(function(e) {....}); that is looking for ENTER KEY (13), i then can do something like button.click(); and get it to work.
[14:25:22] <Poppabear> but, it doesn't do exactly everything like if i was to manually "click" the button ... like setting caret positions, .focus .... i don't know but its annouying :P
[14:27:13] <Poppabear> if i manually click the button, everything works as expected, but not while trying to simulate a click or fire a click event, the form seems to get submitted, but the textarea caret position and everything is not getting reset like it does when i click the button ... any idea's anyone ?
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Poppabear
[14:27:40] <b-ot> Poppabear: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:31:06] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/czwcb2wm/
[14:31:32] <et09> is there a way i can detach an element from its place in the DOM, but retain its horizontal/vertical position to the letter?
[14:32:33] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear btw you've got some problems in your code.
[14:32:58] <HowardwLo> can you move elements using jquery? like i ahve a <img> tag at the bottom of the page, i want to move it to the middle paragraph within a div?
[14:33:16] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: obviously :/
[14:33:28] <robertmaxrees> you're missing variable declarations and stuff, too.
[14:33:35] <et09> HowardwLo: .insertAfter, or edit the string of the text itself
[14:33:46] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: hows so ?
[14:33:48] <dmsuperman> HowardwLo: visually move or move within the DOM?
[14:34:04] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear for (i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { i never gets defined.
[14:34:05] <HowardwLo> et09: how do i calcualte the middle paragraph?
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> you have other vars that also don't get declared.
[14:34:17] <HowardwLo> dmsuperman: move within dom
[14:34:25] <et09> HowardwLo: .split() on String class
[14:34:31] <HowardwLo> dmsuperman: but i guess i could get by with visually moving it if i can put in the right place
[14:34:36] <robertmaxrees> *prototype, not class ;)
[14:34:37] <et09> unless it's an actual </p> tag
[14:34:41] <et09> then you just use insertAfter
[14:34:45] <et09> yeah, prototype
[14:35:23] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: never got any errors in console and that portion of things seem to work just fine ?
[14:35:35] <HowardwLo> et09: split on <p> ?
[14:35:39] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear that's the JS engine protecting you from yourself ;)
[14:35:42] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear anyway, which specific functionality isn't working as you'd expect?
[14:36:06] <et09> HowardwLo: unless you're using <code> or <pre> you're  gonna wanna insertAfter a <p>
[14:36:49] <et09> $("img.mycoolimage").insertAfter("div.container > p:nth-child(2)")
[14:37:05] <et09> or $("img.mycoolimage").insertAfter("div.container > p:nth-of-type(2)")
[14:37:28] <dmsuperman> why do you want literally the middle paragraph anyway?
[14:37:29] <Poppabear> when i manually click the button to submit the form the textarea will reset caret position and gain focus, but not when trying to use the ENTER keypress
[14:37:36] <dmsuperman> sounds like you're after visually moving it
[14:37:51] <HowardwLo> et09: i would have to calculate the middle <p> before hand
[14:37:57] <et09> yeah in that case, you should look into jquery animate and jquery draggable
[14:38:07] <et09> HowardwLo: $("div.container > p").length / 2
[14:38:17] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear do your binding differently then - bind/trigger a custom event for that one.
[14:38:19] <et09> lol
[14:38:33] <Poppabear> hmm
[14:38:45] <Poppabear> ok
[14:38:49] <Poppabear> i'll try
[14:38:53] <robertmaxrees> or explicitly call the function you want instead.
[14:38:58] <HowardwLo> dmsuperman: hum, im not sure how to visually move it
[14:39:08] <Poppabear> yea, i guess i could try that
[14:39:17] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use the DOM to act a sort of MV* setup.
[14:39:21] <dmsuperman> well if you just want to physically move it, that's CSS
[14:39:24] <robertmaxrees> without any framework to help you, so it's awkware.
[14:39:29] <robertmaxrees> *awkward
[14:39:38] <dmsuperman> if you want to drop it into another node I think that's draggable as et09 suggests
[14:39:58] <dmsuperman> maybe wrong on that. how do you want it to move? on some js event?
[14:40:29] <et09> weird use case
[14:41:15] <HowardwLo> i want my image to load within the text
[14:41:22] <HowardwLo> so im moving it everytime
[14:42:00] <HowardwLo> i coudlnt do it in the backend because to edit it there, i would have to parse the html as a string
[14:46:28] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: even explicitly calling the submitMessage doesn't do anything with the caret position, like when i "click" the button the val() will reset, the caret position will reset to 0, the placeholder will be re-apear, and the textarea will still have focus, when i hit the enter key, the val() gets reset, the caret drops to new line, stays on focus.
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear could you setup a functioning example without the socket stuff?
[14:47:31] <Poppabear> prolly
[14:47:42] <robertmaxrees> just hard to parse through this code and your descriptions of stuff.
[14:48:46] <Poppabear> yea i know, its just everything works when i click the button, and i have different results when i press enter ... just seems like it all should do the same thing if its executing the same function/code ...
[14:49:06] <Poppabear> brb
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> you're relying on implicit behavior, which may or may not reliably work.
[14:54:50] <lule> hey guys does anyone know a bypass for this? i'm trying to access an api every 300 milliseconds, but after some seconds(10-15) it blocks me from accessing it, and errors: GET (api url) 503 (Please retry after few minutes)
[14:55:08] <robertmaxrees> don't request every 300 ms
[14:55:19] <robertmaxrees> also: are you waiting for the previous request to complete before sending another one?
[14:55:26] <lule> no
[14:55:33] <lule> ill try that
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're getting rate-limited.
[14:55:59] <lule> yeah after a lot of erroring
[14:56:04] <lule> it threw another different error
[14:56:17] <lule> let me do what you said
[14:58:17] <andrew_r> why do you need to call it every 300 ms?
[14:59:05] <lule> ok so i did what you said
[14:59:13] <lule> but it still errors me after some seconds
[14:59:33] <lule> it's like if the server was blocking me
[15:00:30] <andrew_r> lule: I'm sure the server has a maximum requests limit that you are exceeding.
[15:00:32] <lule> and i think its really blocking me
[15:01:06] <lule> is there a way to bypass that? or do i need to make my script send less requests?
[15:01:35] <fonko> guys is there anyway to reset the dom for click listeners?
[15:01:59] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: for whatever reason jsfiddle doesn't seem to work at all ... lol
[15:02:00] <Poppabear> sec
[15:02:19] <andrew_r> send less requests
[15:02:26] <fonko> something very strange is going on with a popup that i have... after open this pop up i need to RE open it so i can get my "focus" ability back again in the rest of my text areas and links
[15:02:56] <lule> do you know a way to calculate the server max requests per minute?
[15:03:56] <Poppabear> its def not detecting the keypress event, not detecting the e.preventDefault(); .... hmm
[15:04:44] <andrew_r> lule: maybe it's in their documentation for the api?

[15:55:08] <robertmaxrees> Hetachi http://jsfiddle.net/tcobrmvd/1/
[15:55:20] <robertmaxrees> missing a closing paren.
[15:55:52] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio you can't repeat IDs.
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> you can repeat classes.
[15:56:03] <Horacsio> shit!
[15:56:09] <Horacsio> stupido!
[15:56:25] <Hetachi> damn I am blind... -.-
[15:58:41] <Horacsio> no… thats not the only reason!
[15:59:40] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/X2trY/8/
[15:59:48] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:00:18] <Horacsio> I need to behave indipendently
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> then find the correct .bcatroller in relation to the current $(this) object
[16:00:50] <robertmaxrees> and your code is still invalid.
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> fix it.
[16:01:41] <tds5016> hi all. Question for everyone; is there a way to do append() and then execute something after the append() is complete?
[16:01:46] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio http://jsfiddle.net/X2trY/9/
[16:01:59] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 put your code after the .append() and it'll happen after the append is done./
[16:02:07] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: http://plugins.jquery.com/caret/ ... and still doesn't work :/ ... i dunno
[16:02:22] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: oh, .append() is blocking?
[16:02:26] <tds5016> what if it's loading an image?
[16:02:40] <tds5016> I want to wait until everything is already loaded, including extrnal stuff.
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 the append operation is blocking.  loading an image is not.
[16:02:54] <robertmaxrees> then you need to rely on the load event.
[16:03:12] <tds5016> how would I do an append waiting for all of it's resources to have loaded?
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear your markup seems awkward for me.  if I use plain inputs for everything, I can basically get the right functionality.
[16:03:29] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 you have to watch the load event.
[16:03:53] <robertmaxrees> $('img').on('load', function() {});
[16:04:30] <JesseSkinner> tds5016 do you know exactly how many images you're waiting on? or does it vary?
[16:04:58] <Horacsio> robertmaxees: thank you
[16:05:10] <tds5016> it varies.
[16:05:21] <tds5016> there may possibly not even be any external elements at all....
[16:05:37] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: i dunno, i guess its whatever, i will work one something else and revisit this issue i guess.
[16:06:06] <robertmaxrees> kay
[16:06:12] <JesseSkinner> tds5016 then basically you'd have to figure out how many images there are, and add load events to each, then keep a counter that increases by one when each loads, and do something when the counter hits the # you're waiting for
[16:06:13] <robertmaxrees> or you could experiment and figure it out :)
[16:06:40] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 what sort of use case do you have right now?
[16:06:45] <jeffmjack_> is there something wrong with this code, assuming the selector is working? http://jsfiddle.net/nf5s6a5x/
[16:06:51] <JesseSkinner> tds5016 and keep in mind that its possible an image will fail to load, so you might need to watch the error event as well
[16:07:20] <tds5016> robertmaxrees: what I'm doign now is really ugly; I'm thinking I should proabbly just hold off on worrying about this at the moment and take another approach.
[16:07:20] <jeffmjack_> also any advice on a more readable convention for indenting that would be awesome
[16:07:34] <tds5016> I'm just trying to run some experiments with a few hacks.
[16:07:41] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ http://jsfiddle.net/nf5s6a5x/1/
[16:07:45] <robertmaxrees> format like this.
[16:07:51] <tds5016> if there's no simple "load" event after a dom insert, then that's okay. lol..
[16:08:13] <tds5016> oh wait... is there a load event that will tell me what was just loaded?
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 there's a "load" event, but you have to specify which element you care about.
[16:08:22] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: thanks.  but otherwise looks good?
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> not what.
[16:08:34] <robertmaxrees> tds5016 not what was loaded - you have to tell it that part.
[16:08:38] <tds5016> oh; that may or may not work. I'm going to play with this some more until I figure out the question I need to ask.
[16:08:43] <robertmaxrees> those events don't bubble iirc.
[16:09:29] <jeffmjack_> this is driving me crazy, I don't understand why this isn't working in node with cheerio :(
[16:10:24] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: i figured it out -> http://jsfiddle.net/cqonmohw/5/
[16:10:55] <Poppabear> added e.preventDefault(); to the keypress seemed to have fixed it :P
[16:12:58] <Poppabear> assuming because the default action of newline in a textarea was overwritting the other functions, not sure but it works
[16:25:57] <tds5016> I am trying to include a script dynamically....
[16:26:02] <tds5016> it';s giving me this error Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.
[16:26:06] <tds5016> any idea how I'd fix that?

[16:51:26] <robertmaxrees> insert before the 11th child of the p that has a strong tag child element
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> i tend to avoid complex selectors like that because they're confusing.
[16:53:47] <HowardwLo> hmm, not working
[16:54:02] <robertmaxrees> show the hetml you're working against.
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> *html - a fiddle would be awesome.
[16:56:38] <tds5016> is there a way to listen for the load event of an added "script" tag?
[16:57:11] <robertmaxrees> there are mutation observers, but they're inefficient.
[16:57:33] <robertmaxrees> and not widely supported.
[16:58:08] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/mpdt42wc/
[16:58:23] <HowardwLo> thats what et09 suggested i do, and it worked well
[16:58:38] <HowardwLo> but the problem was , i needed it to be more choosy as to which <p> to put it before
[16:58:48] <HowardwLo> it needs to be before a question, aka a <p> with a <strong> in it
[16:59:42] <robertmaxrees> any way you could restructure your html?
[17:00:31] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm trying to figure out how to access a jquery object like you might in PHP using $this->variable from within a class method... Is there a way to do that. Here's an example of my script: http://jsfiddle.net/jyx1tkf3/
[17:01:27] <checkit> ^ forgot to include: http://jsfiddle.net/jyx1tkf3/1/
[17:02:01] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: cant :/
[17:02:16] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo fyi your current html in that last fiddle is way invalid.
[17:02:21] <robertmaxrees> like, almost impossible to work around.
[17:02:24] <HowardwLo> oh
[17:02:54] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/mpdt42wc/1/
[17:03:03] <HowardwLo> sorry about that
[17:03:17] <robertmaxrees> okay - so where do you want the image to show up?
[17:03:30] <HowardwLo> before <p><strong>Question #4
[17:03:43] <HowardwLo> or #3, i dont care which one as long as its in the middle and before a question
[17:05:10] <robertmaxrees> so there's this: http://jsfiddle.net/w4wj0jd6/1/
[17:05:19] <HowardwLo> i was using Math.ceil($(‘div.holder > p>strong').length/2 ) to get the middle one
[17:05:48] <robertmaxrees> did that work?
[17:05:52] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: ya but i dont want that accidentally inserting after a question and before an answer
[17:06:17] <robertmaxrees> why can't you fix the markup btw?
[17:06:21] <robertmaxrees> because this is pretty bad.
[17:06:23] <HowardwLo> the actual html is actually more messy, contains empty <p> and crap because it was convertred from word docx :(
[17:07:03] <robertmaxrees> why not generate good html?  just wondering if you could spend less time devising a solution.
[17:07:26] <HowardwLo> what should it look like ideally?
[17:07:29] <adv_> how can i have 2 ajax calls from jquery?
[17:07:35] <adv_> i tried and it doesn't work
[17:07:37] <robertmaxrees> adv_ that's a vague question.
[17:07:37] <HowardwLo> i can try, but again i’m parsing from a docx file and i’m pretty limited with what i can do
[17:07:48] <robertmaxrees> HowardwLo why are you doing that, though?
[17:08:07] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: my survey is done over word doc file
[17:08:16] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: i want to put those surveys on my site
[17:08:28] <robertmaxrees> why not do the surveys on the site in the first place then?
[17:08:51] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: moving forward, thats what i’d do. but I need to load the ones i have already
[17:08:57] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: and i have over 200 ...
[17:09:14] <HowardwLo> sorry, 2000
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/4zdhqcb/
[17:09:22] <robertmaxrees> something like this would be nice.
[17:09:34] <robertmaxrees> just one extra containing element around each group.
[17:09:58] <Technodrome> how can I do a scroll so it centers the page scroll wise around the element?
[17:10:04] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: i’ll try
[17:10:44] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: in the mean time, do you have a solution for my crappy markup? just so i can get something out?
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> not readily, no.  i'm sure i could bake something up with enough time.
[17:14:05] <HowardwLo> hmm, is chaining :has with :nth-child not good?
[17:15:24] <HowardwLo> ah hah!@

[17:45:04] <blue_warlock> good night peeps
[18:15:11] <zpr> hi, i have two functions: addBookmark(), and delBookmark(). when a user clicks on an open star, it calls addBookmark() which ajaxically adds the bookmark to the db, and changes the star to closed. then i have a line which attempts to change the click listener of the star to delBookmark().. which, as you guessed, tries to change the listener back to addBookmark().. the problem is, after clicking the same star a few times, i have layered calls and upon inspecting,
[18:15:18] <zpr> star.click(function(e) { addBookmark(star, e); });
[18:15:34] <zpr> does that method not first clear the previous click listeners? or must i explicitly do that
[18:16:17] <zpr> with unbind()
[18:17:12] <zpr> guess i've answered my own question
[18:19:39] <et09> ok who needs help
[18:19:59] <et09> i sense a soul in search of angularjs
[21:08:21] <uskerine> hi, any tip to remove everything but digits from a string? -either jQuery or JS- Thanks
[21:12:52] <acidjazz> so if i have a jquery element
[21:12:52] <acidjazz> like
[21:13:00] <acidjazz> $('.row')
[21:13:05] <acidjazz> and there are 10 .row's
[21:13:12] <acidjazz> and i have a click handler on the 7th
[21:13:24] <acidjazz> how can i check in my handler im on the 7th .row of the 10
[21:13:37] <acidjazz> besides putting an data-num=7 in the div
[21:13:45] <Zak> i prepend variable names with $, to indicate that the jquery wrapper should always be present. Does anybody do this, and what do you do for functions? e.g. get$Element() ?
[21:13:56] <Zak> or $getElement event
[21:14:00] <Zak> *even
[21:33:46] <trewd6> how come this allows periods? http://jsbin.com/huhipacoyagi/1/
[22:02:54] <zeroquake> is it preferable to store jquery selector references or do live selections each time?
[22:29:30] <dleynes661> hello.
[22:30:42] <dleynes661> On this piece of code: var branch = $step.find("[name=branchtype]:checked").val();
[22:30:53] <dleynes661> I would like to replace the name=branchtype
[22:30:58] <dleynes661> with hasclass
[22:31:15] <dleynes661> How would I do has class and have it check for the checked input?
[22:33:46] <Prometheian> Do I have to setup the javascript to handle tabs in bootstrap, or should I be able to just setup the html and be done w/ it?
[22:36:50] <Cork> dleynes661: $('.class-name:checked')
[22:37:42] <dleynes661> If the class looked like this: class="required check_radio"
[22:38:01] <dleynes661> ...and with your example I only target a single class
[22:38:06] <dleynes661> will it still work?
[22:38:16] <Cork> dleynes661: just chain the class names with dot
[22:38:42] <dleynes661> What if I wanted to do the has class and have it :checked?
[22:39:04] <Cork> why would you want to use hasClass?
[22:39:27] <dleynes661> I just want it to check to see if a tag has a certain class
[22:39:31] <dleynes661> and if it does...target it
[22:39:38] <dleynes661> but it has to be checked
[22:39:45] <Cork> the browsers built in query engine can do that
[22:39:56] <Cork> with the string i gave you
[22:40:06] <Cork> dleynes661: you might want to read up on css selectors
[22:40:32] <dleynes661> So it'll still select that class name even if other classes are within the tag with the example you've given?
[22:40:49] <Cork> dleynes661: read up on how css selectors work
[22:41:23] <Cork> jquerys selector works exactly like normal css selectors with a few additionals (that doesn't change behavior)
[22:43:17] <dleynes661> will do
[22:43:18] <dleynes661> thanks
[23:36:22] <Stummi> Hi, I have an svg element on my html page (currently included with <object ...>, but I am open for other ways, if there are better ones) and would like to manipulate its DOM/some attributes. Is there a way to access the DOM of an SVG-Object?
