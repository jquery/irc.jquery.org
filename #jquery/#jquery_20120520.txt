[00:11:49] <anusx4> tw2113: I fixed that for you
[00:15:54] <tw2113> extra padding?
[00:16:35] <anusx4> yeah, the fix was even sitting in one of the developer's repos just not committed
[00:16:40] <tw2113> heh
[00:16:58] <tw2113> now i can claim i had a little influence on it
[00:17:26] <anusx4> yeah, but don't put it on your resume, adult industry tends to hurt more than help
[00:17:51] <tw2113> i'll leave it at bragging on IM only
[00:20:52] <anusx4> Whirl3d can take credit for the next version of our Orgy page cause he helped maked the animations possible
[00:21:05] <anusx4> few days ago
[00:21:25] <anusx4> otlate though,
[00:21:32] <anusx4> er, it's super late though, gnight
[00:32:02] <Lucky--> so this successfully executes, and gets the result, however it doesnt update the input fields? http://pastebin.com/uGfdCw8w
[00:34:17] <anusx4> try defining the callback before the ajax
[00:34:32] <Lucky--> the callback gets the data
[00:34:35] <Lucky--> i tested it with alerts
[00:34:40] <Lucky--> it just isnt refreshing my input fields
[00:34:48] <Lucky--> (lol im actually doing a landing page right now)
[00:34:54] <Lucky--> want to make the autocomplete
[00:56:51] <riyonuk> Am I wasting my time learning jQuery? I know quite a lot, but I'm not much of a designer, and I really don't want to be.
[00:58:32] <Bogdaniel> can someone help me with a jquery problem ?
[00:58:56] <Dr-Bombay> why are you learning jquery
[00:59:11] <Dr-Bombay> riyonuk: what are you expecting from jquery
[00:59:21] <Bogdaniel> http://jsfiddle.net/xMNdC/3/ i have that form when i run it for the first time it shows only the date without the time any ideeas how to solve the problem ?
[00:59:46] <systemfault> riyonuk: jQuery has nothing to do with design.
[00:59:48] <riyonuk> To expand my career really. I wanted to get into backbone.js, and node.js, so I picked up javascript, and am not picking up jQuery (I already knew some if it to begin with though).
[00:59:56] <riyonuk> *now
[01:00:03] <Dr-Bombay> riyonuk: jquery is designed around the needs of the front end
[01:00:11] <Dr-Bombay> unlike nodejs
[01:00:15] <PhoenixTHIS> http://jqapi.com/
[01:00:18] <riyonuk> All the designers I work with seem to know a little of it, so I'm wondering if I would even be "needed".
[01:00:25] <riyonuk> Or do designer not usually code anything?
[01:00:34] <Dr-Bombay> bogdaniel: don't show two-digit dates you wacko >:(
[01:00:35] <systemfault> riyonuk: Designers never code.
[01:00:55] <riyonuk> Hmm. Guess I'm the exception then (used to be a front-end designer).
[01:00:57] <systemfault> riyonuk: Unless you work for some weird startup where designers do code..
[01:01:06] <PhoenixTHIS> soket.io nice protocol multiplex)
[01:01:11] <riyonuk> So that's the norm? Designers design, and someone else does the front-end development?
[01:01:18] <riyonuk> haha, I do work for a startup
[01:01:21] <systemfault> riyonuk: Yes, a front-end programmer.
[01:01:51] <systemfault> riyonuk: front-end programming is a discipline by itself… gone are the days of copy pasting snippets of JS.
[01:02:23] <PhoenixTHIS> http://socket.io/#how-to-use
[01:02:23] <systemfault> riyonuk: You mentioned backbone earlier…. A designer cannot handle that.
[01:02:31] <systemfault> (A normal one.. at least)
[01:02:51] <Bogdaniel> Dr-Bombay what do you mean by don't show two digit date :-) ? :D
[01:02:57] <riyonuk> Actually, guess you're right. At my previous startup, our senior designer didn't even know html.
[01:03:00] <systemfault> Creative… Technical… Very few people are both.
[01:03:56] <systemfault> I personally am highly technical… but has only basic design skills (It takes me days to find an acceptable design)
[01:04:50] <riyonuk> Just don't use Twitter bootstrap, that is so overdone.
[01:04:57] <Dr-Bombay> huh, guess it shows all the digits anyway
[01:05:25] <Dr-Bombay> yeah and it's got that "special" coding style too
[01:05:35] <systemfault> riyonuk: bootstrap is a toy… It's nice for a CMS or to write crap website..
[01:05:45] <Dr-Bombay> like the guy who wrote it doesn't give a crap whether anyone can read or work on his code
[01:05:46] <systemfault> It was really done for twitter.
[01:06:02] <riyonuk> Every new startup on HN seems to be in love with it. Drives me mad.
[01:06:12] <systemfault> riyonuk: Heh...
[01:06:35] <systemfault> riyonuk: It easily gives a website a consistent feel...
[01:06:49] <Dr-Bombay> HN?
[01:07:01] <systemfault> Hacker News
[01:07:03] <Dr-Bombay> oh goody another ad for a rockstar
[01:07:11] <systemfault> news.ycombinator.com
[01:07:18] <systemfault> It's a must.
[01:07:19] <Dr-Bombay> yeah let me show up for the onsite interview and play some of my riffs man
[01:07:26] <systemfault> That website… visit it daily
[01:07:48] <systemfault> (Even though I prefer hackurls.com)
[01:07:49] <Dr-Bombay> "rockstar backend engineer"  even weirder

[01:11:04] <systemfault> Whoa… Zuckerberg got married.
[01:16:23] <PhoenixTHIS> http://php.net/manual/pt_BR/migration54.ini.php
[01:25:07] <systemfault> And?
[01:30:32] <Lundy> morning guys, im running a web page from my localhost but is there a way off doing when the page is loaded check to see if the localhost is connected to the internet and if it is then do XXXX else do YYYY ???
[01:32:41] <systemfault> Lundy: Do you need to support older browsers?
[01:34:26] <Lundy> ammmmmm, I would say no ... this project I should be able to tell the company to use google Chrome for everything :)
[01:35:29] <systemfault> Lundy: Then perhaps navigator.onLine will be enough
[01:39:09] <Dr-Bombay> don't try to make a network connection just to see whether you can make a connection. that's wasteful
[01:39:09] <PhoenixTHIS> IE6 burn in hell ;)
[01:40:05] <PhoenixTHIS> http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/
[01:40:26] <Dr-Bombay> if you send an xmlhttprequest and the client cannot get a response from the server, you'll get a timeout
[01:40:40] <systemfault> Indeed...
[01:40:58] <systemfault> But he said he didn't have to support older browsers..
[01:41:36] <Dr-Bombay> (assuming you set a timeout interval on the object)
[01:41:49] <Lunders> i shouldnt need to support old browseers
[01:42:12] <PhoenixTHIS> xml many traffic web application
[01:42:13] <Lunders> as the company im doing the project for like to use new technolgies if its going to help the company
[01:42:19] <PhoenixTHIS> maybe used JSon ?
[01:42:31] <systemfault> PhoenixTHIS: What?
[01:42:42] <PhoenixTHIS> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[01:42:57] <systemfault> PhoenixTHIS: What's wrong with it?
[01:43:17] <Dr-Bombay> lunders: new technologies, sure, but not if they screw the user
[01:43:26] <Dr-Bombay> new technologies on the server, no problem. the users don't see that
[01:43:31] <Dr-Bombay> telling them which browser to use? bad
[01:45:23] <Lunders> Dr-Bombay: simple as this ....... the reps for the company will be getting a laptop, they go out into a clients house / work ect ... load up the laptop and BANG they will have a web server running off the laptop which has a nice product lookup loaded str8 up, they can search for the product that client wants / needs and give him full prices ect......
[01:46:07] <Lunders> the reason for the online check is, im going to have a ...... if your online then check the last time the product list was updated and tell the rep they need to update their cateloge
[01:48:26] <PhoenixTHIS> jQuery support WebSocket connection ?
[01:48:37] <Dr-Bombay> no it doesn't
[01:50:12] <libin> can someone please give me a hint how can i get the value from a cell in a selected row in datatable
[01:50:50] <systemfault> Wtf.
[01:51:14] <systemfault> Just select the column?
[01:52:08] <libin> well..not exactly
[01:52:23] <libin> there is a plugin called datatables
[01:52:44] <libin> and it has got an option called multi select row
[01:52:51] <systemfault> I guess we just don't have the same definition of a database..
[01:52:52] <systemfault> Sorry.
[01:52:59] <systemfault> Ahhh
[01:53:04] <systemfault> datatable?
[01:53:14] <libin> www.datatables.net
[01:53:31] <libin> wait.. let me confirm the url
[01:53:52] <libin> yes that url is right
[01:54:54] <libin> anyone familiar with datatables plugin?
[01:58:33] <Dr-Bombay> $('#tbl tr.row_selected td')
[01:59:22] <Lucky--> lol @ using my dropbox as a CDN for jquery plugins
[01:59:52] <Dr-Bombay> I hate people who ask and run
[02:04:40] <Lucky--> t
[02:04:43] <Lucky--> http://www.mathachew.com/sandbox/jquery-autotab/ = the shit
[02:07:36] <Dr-Bombay> it's really hard to get excited about things that have been in the native platform for a decade or more
[02:08:41] <faryshta> Is here where the pile of  functions is defined? https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery/test-jhp/src/callbacks.js
[02:10:21] <Dr-Bombay> which pile
[02:10:25] <Lucky--> Dr-Bombay: o rly?
[02:10:30] <Lucky--> Dr-Bombay: where lol?
[02:10:36] <Lucky--> im a jquery nub
[02:11:39] <Dr-Bombay> get off my lawn
[02:13:04] <PhoenixTHIS> is there a better  uploader https://github.com/valums/file-uploader ??
[02:14:23] <PhoenixTHIS> exists better plugin upload file && Drag-drop html5?
[02:14:37] <Lunders> whats better for checking if current date is 1 month ago from another date? timestamp or formatted?
[02:16:40] <Dr-Bombay> 1 month ago is not consistent, 30 days is
[02:16:51] <faryshta> Dr-Bombay, AFAIK when you use methods suck as $.click(function (){}); what jquery does is to store it into a pile of functions.
[02:16:56] <Dr-Bombay> unless you are releasing on a particular day of the month
[02:17:16] <faryshta> I think in some countries its called stack.
[02:17:20] <Dr-Bombay> faryshta: you're wrong. That is a javascript feature, nothing to do with jquery
[02:17:49] <Dr-Bombay> well, maybe
[02:18:04] <Dr-Bombay> I don't know the details of the old event system
[02:18:19] <faryshta> Dr-Bombay, javascript rewrites functions in the current event system.
[02:18:54] <Dr-Bombay> that doesn't make any sense to me
[02:24:34] <BinaryKitten> ? rewrites function in the current event system??
[02:24:46] <BinaryKitten> can you explain that some more please faryshta
[02:25:29] <BinaryKitten> as Dr-Bombay said .. it doesn't make any sense
[02:27:57] <Dr-Bombay> anythign related to events will most likely be here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js
[02:29:18] <PhoenixTHIS> nice :) http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/2593/20120520122841.png
[02:33:33] <Dr-Bombay> can't read moon letters sorry
[02:38:10] <faryshta> BinaryKitten, lets suppose you have document.body.click=function (){alert('hola');}; document.body.click=function (){alert('mundo');};
[02:38:37] <faryshta> on a stack model the outcome would be two alert windows. On the JS model will be just the last one.
[02:38:50] <faryshta> jquery have a stack model.
[02:38:55] <faryshta> I am asking where its defined.
[02:39:06] <BinaryKitten> actually in any model, that would have no events
[02:39:23] <BinaryKitten> standard js has stacks
[02:39:34] <BinaryKitten> ?mdc addEventListener
[02:39:34] <faryshta> where?
[02:39:35] <caniuse> BinaryKitten: element.addEventListener - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[02:40:17] <Dr-Bombay> faryshta: stack is not the word you are looking for
[02:40:59] * BinaryKitten suddenly remembers a quote from the movie "Princess Bride"
[02:41:18] <Dr-Bombay> yeah that too
[02:50:27] <Lunders> http://jsfiddle.net/Aczem/ - anyone able to help :/ I dunno where im going wrong
[02:50:49] <Lunders> trying to check and see if last update was more than 30 days ago
[02:52:50] <Milos> Shouldn't you be doing now - old?
[02:56:31] <PhoenixTHIS> try update_checker.php add LIMIT or BETWEEN Operator
[02:57:13] <PhoenixTHIS> SORT date DB + limit 30 day
[02:58:51] <Jax> what's the difference between .get and .load?
[02:58:57] <Lunders> PhoenixTHIS: at this very second update_checker.php is just "$array['last_update'] = mktime(0, 0, 0, 01, 01, 2012);"
[02:59:00] <Jax> or when would you use them
[02:59:01] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/QZudt6A3 why does this when i have a name that is : "My product" my cart is not adding it down to the form?
[03:00:47] <BinaryKitten> Lunders
[03:00:58] <BinaryKitten> * that by 1000
[03:01:06] <BinaryKitten> mktime returns seconds
[03:01:27] <PhoenixTHIS> now time + 30 day for seconds
[03:01:34] <BinaryKitten> Date.now() (<--- function not property... too )
[03:01:45] <BinaryKitten> Date.now() return in milliseconds
[03:02:05] <mooijk> hi. i've fetched from a webservice using getJSON, then i want to fetch the first line out before iterating through the rest. what is the most correct way of doing that?
[03:02:07] <PhoenixTHIS> https://www.google.com/search?q=30+days+to+seconds
[03:02:49] <BinaryKitten> 30*24*60*60
[03:03:36] <PhoenixTHIS> limit 30 = (timestamp + 2678400)
[03:04:01] <BinaryKitten> var checkTime = (data.last_update *1000) < Date.now() - (30*24*60*60*1000)
[03:04:08] <BinaryKitten> or something close
[03:04:38] <andr0id1> anyone?
[03:05:29] <BinaryKitten> andr0id1 is the request happening?
[03:06:01] <PhoenixTHIS> function MaxDaysMonth(month,year) { var dd = new Date(year, month, 0); return dd.getDate(); }
[03:06:04] <andr0id1> when i have a name like: "product" it works fine, but if it is: :My product" or anything with white space, it doesnt work
[03:07:12] <andr0id1> i just keep wandering: why?
[03:07:27] <BinaryKitten> andr0id1 you'll need to step through your code debugging...
[03:07:40] <BinaryKitten> there might be something simple that's being missed
[03:08:00] * BinaryKitten doesn't like html string building
[03:08:05] <Lunders> http://jsfiddle.net/Aczem/1/ - keeps saying "all is ok" am I doing something wrong?
[03:08:16] <andr0id1> well tried, but i dont seem to see anything, can you give it a try?
[03:08:26] <BinaryKitten> +new Date()/1000 ?
[03:08:38] <BinaryKitten> andr0id1 how can i give it a try?
[03:09:12] <andr0id1> well just look at my code
[03:09:22] <BinaryKitten> i did
[03:09:30] <andr0id1> and there is nothing wrong?
[03:09:37] <BinaryKitten> and I suggested you run a debug.. step through it
[03:09:51] <BinaryKitten> add a break point in the code and then step through to see what it's doing
[03:10:05] <PhoenixTHIS> http://jsbin.com/#javascript,html
[03:10:05] <andr0id1> ok, will try that
[03:10:13] <andr0id1> thanks for the advice :)
[03:10:35] <BinaryKitten> np
[03:10:55] <BinaryKitten> if you get stuck, try creating items by hand in the console
[03:11:07] <BinaryKitten> and break the code down into small chunks you know works
[03:11:11] <ldz420> I am trying to understand something about jquery. I am using reading jquery in action which is using jquery1.4 but wanted to know why when trying to select an element such as with $('.example')[0].mouseover  = why must I use the [0]?
[03:11:17] <andr0id1> that works :)
[03:11:49] <BinaryKitten> why would you use .mouseover?
[03:12:07] <BinaryKitten> ok ldz420
[03:12:20] <BinaryKitten> $('.example') returns you a wrapped array
[03:12:39] <BinaryKitten> if it has items, [0] will give you the 1st dom element
[03:12:56] <BinaryKitten> .mouseover then uses the native js event handler
[03:13:09] <PhoenixTHIS> jquery alert( print array ) possible?
[03:13:11] <BinaryKitten> but that's really not the right way to do things in that way
[03:13:23] <ldz420> oh because it is showing me dom level 0 just for show
[03:13:27] <BinaryKitten> PhoenixTHIS console.log(array)
[03:13:54] <BinaryKitten> ldz420  $('.example').eq(0).mouseover(function(){});
[03:14:21] <ldz420> binarykitten: what makes using the eq(0) better?
[03:14:35] <BinaryKitten> eq returns the jquery wrapped element
[03:14:54] <BinaryKitten> which gives you all the jquery methods to interact with the element
[03:15:44] <ldz420> binarykitten: thanks alot for the explanation and advise
[03:15:57] <BinaryKitten> the advice is free
[03:16:38] <BinaryKitten> ldz420 in the end, you have a collection  that $('.example') gives you
[03:16:53] <BinaryKitten> you can interact with every item in that collection by calling methods directly
[03:17:18] <BinaryKitten> you can get a single item from the collection wrapped or unwrapped (.eq  or .get)
[03:17:44] <BinaryKitten> all depends on how and what you want to do
[03:17:48] <fredl> 'lo folks. Been googling a fair bit for handling uploads using xhr2 & jquery
[03:18:40] <fredl> there's plenty to find obviously, but I like to use jquery with as little extensions as possible, so is there some native documentation on how to use this from jquery?
[03:18:59] <BinaryKitten> can you explain what xhr2 is and how it's used?
[03:19:47] <fredl> xhtmlrequest, 'latest' incarnation. Don't know too much about it myself yet but would rather work through learning it from a jquery perspective.
[03:20:30] <fredl> since jquery has often provided me with extremely elegant solutions in the past...
[03:20:52] <BinaryKitten> fredl  where are you reading/learning about xhr2?
[03:21:03] <BinaryKitten> and which browsers is it implemented in?
[03:21:10] <fredl> BinaryKitten, are you a bot?
[03:21:18] <BinaryKitten> no I'm not
[03:21:32] <fredl> ok. Just checking before I make a fool of myself :P
[03:21:37] <BinaryKitten> heh
[03:22:05] <BinaryKitten> caniuse is though
[03:22:42] <BinaryKitten> so fredl .. to help, I kinda need to see what you're seeing .. docs etc
[03:22:43] <fredl> BinaryKitten, it would seem that all major recent browsers support it, it's an extension the the older xhtmlrequest object. What I would like to use it for is to provide my website users with a very simple method to upload images.
[03:22:52] <Jax> we got a loader component somewhere?
[03:23:19] <BinaryKitten> Jax can you define what you mean by "loader component"
[03:23:36] <Jax> while an get() or load() is loading data, it should present a loader to the user
[03:23:49] <fredl> BinaryKitten, here's a doc http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/
[03:24:15] <sorahn> anyone know if there is a better way to make a function that can be called with an event handler, and one that can be chained. http://jsfiddle.net/wLXBg/1/
[03:25:04] <BinaryKitten> Jax see ?.ajaxStart etc
[03:25:10] <fredl> BinaryKitten, just out of curiosity, how experienced are you with the latest and greatest of jquery? :)
[03:25:19] <BinaryKitten> ?.ajaxStart @ Jax
[03:25:37] <Jax> thx, checking that
[03:25:39] <BinaryKitten> fredl i have a good experience set
[03:25:40] <Dr-Bombay> BinaryKitten here's a duck: http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm307/lilchick011/smoking_duck-18594.jpg
[03:25:53] <BinaryKitten> Dr-Bombay wtf?
[03:26:47] <Dr-Bombay> hmph, i try to be helpful
[03:27:24] <BinaryKitten> with a smoking duck?
[03:27:29] <BinaryKitten> how is that helpful?
[03:27:42] <fredl> BinaryKitten, from what I'm reading, xhr2 is (fairly) 'new', so few docs that I find look a little bit uhm... shall we say kludgy; Good for understanding the bits and blobs... but I'd like to be *using* the bits and blobs and just understand the interface to it at this point, so my question is really if jQuery has built in support for 'uploading files using xhr2 objects' :)
[03:28:12] <fredl> (trying hard not to come across as a clueless end-luser here :)
[03:28:15] <BinaryKitten> from the looks of it fredl  xhr2 works the same as xhr   with added bonus
[03:28:53] <fredl> correct.
[03:28:53] <BinaryKitten> fredl if you wanted to switch it out, you will need to monkey-patch the $.ajax method
[03:29:28] <Jax> BinaryKitten:  i suppose there is also a handler to stop the loader, or do you do that within the get or load success function?
[03:29:39] <BinaryKitten> now i might understand the link that Dr-Bombay was going on ...
[03:29:40] <BinaryKitten> http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[03:29:51] <Dr-Bombay> that smoking duck is more likely to be compatible with your users' browsers than xmlhttprequest2
[03:29:59] <Jax> ajaxComplete <3
[03:30:04] <fredl> Dr-Bombay :)
[03:30:05] <BinaryKitten> Jax  .ajaxStop
[03:31:21] <fredl> I'm just wondering to myself if image uploads should be available to *all* my site's users or a limited subset that I can simply tell to have an up-to-date browser...
[03:31:22] <BinaryKitten> Complete will only work on non errors Jax
[03:31:46] <BinaryKitten> fredl it all depends on how you want to do it
[03:31:59] <Jax> yep just read that
[03:32:04] <BinaryKitten> personally until XHR2 is that prevalent, I would stick with something like uploadify
[03:32:09] <fredl> I guess acknowledging that *all* users need this functionality at some point kinda gives me my answer if I *should* be using xhr2 at all at this point.
[03:32:35] <fredl> ayt, fair enuf.
[03:34:34] <burg> hello. is it possible to be notified when i scroll down to a specified element? or maybe do you know any plugin for that?
[03:35:31] <Jax> does anybody know a good visual html/css loading component? would be nice to just have something turning or so. a loader bar isn't what i'm looking for (à la twitter bootstrap)
[03:40:50] <BinaryKitten> burg yep
[03:40:57] <BinaryKitten> look for jquery waypoints
[03:41:14] <burg> BinaryKitten: thank you
[03:41:21] <fredl> BinaryKitten, just looking at uploadify, but it looks like that's commercial...
[03:41:53] <BinaryKitten> html5 version is
[03:42:07] <fredl> what's a good free alternative? In the future I might want to include commercial solutions in my site but right now I don't want to spend the money yet
[03:42:08] <BinaryKitten> the flash version (standard been around for ages) continues to be free
[03:42:34] <fredl> hmmm ok. and what if I want to avoid flash altogether?
[03:42:44] <fredl> any alternatives then?
[03:42:44] <BinaryKitten> then I don't know
[03:42:49] <fredl> ok
[03:42:51] <BinaryKitten> because without flash, or iframe hack
[03:43:02] <BinaryKitten> you can't do so without a form submission
[03:44:12] <fredl> well perhaps if I explain what I'd like to do you might say 'oh you silly why dont you just use such and so' :)
[03:44:29] <BinaryKitten> heh. sorry
[03:44:39] <BinaryKitten> Infinite answers to infinite questions
[03:44:54] <BinaryKitten> there is no 1 true way
[03:45:08] <fredl> essentially, I would like to add functionality that lets my users upload only one image without hitting the form submit.
[03:45:58] <fredl> so you're saying that requires either flash or iframe hack, correct?
[03:46:01] <BinaryKitten> hook the file fields change event, create iframe, set target of form to iframe, submit form via code
[03:46:36] <BinaryKitten> yep sorry fredl at this point in time, there are ways to do it, but none that are simple to explain.
[03:47:15] <BinaryKitten> all require fancy "HTML5" or xhr2 .. the simplest are the "use something else" aka flash
[03:47:16] <fredl> okay, fair enuf. Also sounds like I don't really *need* something like uploadify for that but it's mildly simple to code myself.
[03:47:23] <BinaryKitten> or point to a frame
[03:47:58] <BinaryKitten> afterall, this stuff was happening back in html4 time (late 90s)
[03:48:11] <fredl> still trying to make up my mind :P anyway that's not your call, thanks for helping :)
[03:48:19] <BinaryKitten> no worries :)
[03:48:28] <BinaryKitten> time for coffee and Sunday morning TV
[03:48:45] <BinaryKitten> caniuse jquery?

[03:54:58] <io__> hi
[03:55:09] <smoking_peanuts> hey io__
[04:06:00] <mink> Hello ;)
[04:07:30] <io__> sorry, worng channel, but good morning anyway
[04:07:43] <mink> Who know why jQuery UI (animate addClass) not animate CSS3-gradient on background?
[04:07:52] <mink> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1821283533 (sorry, js fiddle not work)
[04:11:01] <LucaS05> hi
[04:11:47] <LucaS05> i've a problem with the load function...i load chunks of a static page based on the url but jquery loads all the page
[04:15:57] <lmatteis> hello
[04:16:03] <lmatteis> can i order items in a jquery selector?
[04:16:10] <lmatteis> by a value inside the DOM elements?
[04:17:41] <jbw> lmatteis, no - you'd have to sort it yourself
[04:21:44] <LucaS05> no one?
[04:29:01] <Whirl3d> LucaS05, check to see if the chunk you are loading has a problem with conflicting ID's in the one you are loading into.
[04:36:20] <Aha2Y> How can i remove the last char of a INPUT box with jQuery?
[04:37:08] <Dr-Bombay> it's a string
[04:37:23] <Dr-Bombay> do string things to it
[04:40:06] <WeeJeWel> Hey guys. Is there a plugin or so to toggle a class on Foo, and child element bar gets animated according to it's css?
[04:40:40] <WeeJeWel> For example: foo.show .bar { opacity: 1; } fades in .bar when <foo> gets the class show
[04:40:48] <WeeJeWel> (Like css transitions, but JS)
[04:42:36] <dabear> WeeJeWel: well no, but you can come close with .switchClass
[04:42:43] <dabear> WeeJeWel: requires jquery ui: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions
[04:42:49] <WeeJeWel> dabear: that only applies to the selected element, right?
[04:44:09] <dabear> WeeJeWel: correct, you would then have to do a switchClass when the .show is finished
[04:44:15] <dabear> .show() *
[04:46:30] <LucaS05> Whirl3d what you mean?
[04:48:59] <burg> BinaryKitten: do you know any other similar plugin? i need to trigger both when top of div is/isn`t on viewport and when bottom of div is/isn`t in viewport, and viewpoints doesn`t do that
[04:50:21] <Draem> Assuming I had two tables classed quare, on document ready, how would I hide the first quare table, and on click of the second table's img, hide the second table and show the first?
[04:50:56] <Draem> Also assuming they're both in a div classed tbls
[04:51:13] <dabear> you wouldn't
[04:51:25] <dabear> because you would have a flash of unstyled content
[04:52:26] <dabear> set the first table to display:none in css
[04:53:00] <dabear> on click of table two, .show() the first table
[04:53:16] <Draem> How do I find table two?
[04:53:24] <Draem> I've attempted to use .eq(1)
[04:53:36] <Draem> and nth-child(2) to no avail.
[04:53:37] <dabear> var $tables = $("table")
[04:53:49] <dabear> $table.eq(0) and .eq(1)
[04:53:59] <dabear> $tables sry
[04:54:40] <Draem> $(".tbls").eq(1).click(function() {
[04:54:58] <Draem> Like so?
[04:55:24] <Draem> tbls is the parent div holding the two tables
[04:55:51] <dabear> yes, but didn't I just show you to save the table to a variable?
[04:55:57] <dabear> so that you can reuse it
[04:56:22] <LucaS05> hey guys somebody knows why when i load chunks of a static page based on the url of a link the load jquery function loads all the page?
[04:56:24] <dabear> $tables.eq(0).find("img.yourimg").click
[04:56:25] <dabear> ..
[04:56:25] <TheHackOps> Hey guys, so im building a web application and i need a way that when someone updates a specific page the page gets updated on eveeryone elses screen
[04:57:27] <dabear> LucaS05: using .load(url)?
[04:57:31] <Draem> $tbls.eq(1).find("img").click(function() {
[04:58:15] <dabear> LucaS05: in that case, jquery downloads the whole url, puts the content in a div, filters it and returns it
[04:58:35] <Draem> Ah perfect, thanks.
[04:59:12] <TheHackOps> dabear, does jQuery have the kind of functions i need?
[04:59:15] <LucaS05> yes
[05:01:11] <LucaS05> sorry connection problems
[05:01:41] <LucaS05> anyway i was talking about the chrom panel...if i see what i get as return i see the entire document
[05:01:59] <LucaS05> and the request takes 1.2 second and more
[05:02:22] <TheHackOps> LucaS05, Mind helping me dude i would be pretty greatfull
[05:03:46] <LucaS05> what you mean? sorry i'm italian :D
[05:03:59] <LucaS05> you have the same problem?
[05:04:46] <TheHackOps> No, im trying to build a page that when the (Session owner) changes something it is updated live on everyone elses screens
[05:05:37] <LucaS05> sorry i can't :(
[05:05:50] <TheHackOps> nvm i found a phpacademy tutorial
[05:05:55] <TheHackOps> cheers anyway guys
[05:05:57] <TheHackOps> :P
[05:08:34] <LucaS05> anyone for the load problem?
[05:18:19] <Whirl3d> LucaS05, setup a fiddle and I'll look at it
[05:26:39] <LucaS05> i've a main.js file how can i call a function that will be in a loaded.js file that i load with $.getScript ?
[05:28:55] <Aha2Y> How can i make a togle so if i hit the button it changes the value from button-01 to ` and class to button-2 and when press again it changes value from button-01 to ~ and class to button-01
[05:28:56] <Aha2Y> http://pastebin.com/ArKGdmCL
[05:28:57] <dabear> LucaS05: just call them as normal. you gotta wait until the getscript has returned though
[05:29:14] <Aha2Y> as in http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php <- the shift button
[05:30:24] <dabear> Aha2Y: see .toggle
[05:30:32] <dabear> and use removeClass/addClass
[05:34:32] <LucaS05> how can i check that?
[05:35:38] <LucaS05> i'm viewing the doc ;)
[05:39:35] <Asmooh> hi
[05:42:01] <Asmooh> does the load option only loads basic text?
[05:59:09] <LucaS05> but for wait until the getscript returned you mean the complete callback function?
[05:59:34] <LucaS05> cause i've putted the code of the function call there but i get an error
[06:22:40] <iwtu> hello. what is good jQuery tutorial? w3schools sucks about javascript so i suppose it are similar to jquery
[06:26:55] <markus_> hy. i have someproblem with jquery and a form. when somebody clicks the submit button i want jquery to do a ajax call. code: http://pastebin.com/eF6GrcbQ  in the chromebrowser everythink is allright, but firefox does a normal post call. what am i doing wrong? thanks for help!
[06:31:07] <xec> markus_: try $("#createidea").submit(function (event) { ...
[06:31:50] <xec> although, you do have a return false,which i thought would be sufficient
[06:34:12] <markus_> xec sry i was kicked
[06:34:23] <markus_> xec i think i allready do what you have written or not?
[06:35:06] <xec> you're missing the event parameter
[06:35:29] <markus_> ahh sry i am new to jquery. what does the event parameter says?
[06:35:44] <xec> you are doing $("#createidea").submit(function() {
[06:37:35] <markus_> -
[06:37:44] <xec> the event object is passed to your function through the first parameter. i see you do event.preventDefault(); but event is not going to be defined (except in IE iirc)
[06:41:08] <xec> markus_: http://jsfiddle.net/Dt9ts/
[06:49:58] <Byric> hi!
[06:50:04] <Byric> need a little help

[06:51:33] <Byric> Asmooh: perhapes,some missing ; somewhere?
[06:52:28] <Byric> err I suppose I should ask if I expect anything
[06:52:59] <Byric> I am trying to insertAfter some html with a comma but the comma is always missing
[06:52:59] <Asmooh> well i tried all of those examples: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:53:02] <Asmooh> none worked
[06:53:24] <Byric> :) well bad luck eh? maybe those examples are outdated?
[06:54:02] <iwtu> any nice jquery tutorial? :)
[06:54:10] <Byric> Asmooh: could you tell me, how I can put a comma(,)_using insertAfter?
[06:54:27] <Asmooh> i dunno; i dont know anything about jquery
[06:54:47] <Byric> iwtu: I find 'JQuery: from novice to ninjas" extremely easy to understand and yet less jargon and more fun and real code
[06:55:03] <Byric> ^ sorry for that many 'and'
[06:57:06] <iwtu> Byric: link?
[06:57:14] <Byric> err wait
[06:57:16] <Byric> :)
[06:57:34] <iwtu> :)
[06:57:48] <Byric> http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jquery1/
[06:58:03] <Byric> ^ spoiler: its a book and you gotta either buy it or
[06:58:05] <Byric> .... you know
[06:58:45] <Byric> so any help for me?
[06:58:55] <sbarcteam> hi.
[06:58:57] <Byric> google doesn't give me anything useful or am not google ninja
[06:59:06] <Byric> sbarcteam: hello there! :)
[06:59:13] <sbarcteam> is there a way to get the checkbox list's value by input name ?
[06:59:24] <sbarcteam> I'm a bit confused.
[06:59:54] <sbarcteam> I would like to do it something like $("input[name=ordertype]").getlistvalue()
[07:00:10] <sbarcteam> because val() returns me something I don't expect.
[07:00:29] <markus_> .
[07:00:34] <Byric> .
[07:00:52] <markus_> xec thanks for help
[07:01:27] <markus_> xed i changed the code but now i have the problem that i get no result from $form.find('input[name="Kurzbeschreibung"]').val(),
[07:02:33] <markus_> xec i changed the code but now i have the problem that i get no result from $form.find('input[name="Kurzbeschreibung"]').val(),
[07:03:41] <iwtu> ok. so any free jquery tutorial? :)
[07:03:54] <xec> markus_: ok? is the selector working? any errors in console? does the field actually have a value?
[07:04:22] <Byric> iwtu: well I don't find anything that is pretty useful
[07:04:47] <markus_> the field has an value. the problem is, that i see the error just for some millisecunds. than the page reloads... :(
[07:04:59] <Byric> iwtu: most of the tutorials out there are like teaching you number multiply table for doing calculus
[07:05:00] <markus_> xec the field has an value. the problem is, that i see the error just for some millisecunds. than the page reloads... :(
[07:05:26] <Byric> iwtu: but you could just do some advanced google and who knows,maybe you'll find something interesting
[07:05:42] <Byric> iwtu: I suggest you head over to nettuts,they got somewhat useful tutorials
[07:06:36] <iwtu> Byric: I let you know If I found  something interersing
[07:07:00] <xec> markus_: obviously, running that one line of code isnt going to reload the page
[07:07:04] <Byric> iwtu: kk thanks mate :)
[07:07:22] <xec> markus_: so i suggest you use the console to test and see if it works ;)
[07:08:14] <markus_> xec no but i get an error and than my method stops and a normal post-submit is done. because javascript never reach the return false code
[07:08:28] <Whirl3d> Can anyone provide a link to explain how to access data from mySQL using PHP and Jquery. I have tried the googles and have yet to get one to work at all...so I am asking for someone who has experience to show me the way, please.
[07:08:34] <xec> what happens if you just run that one line
[07:08:35] <Byric> iwtu: check these out,maybe some are good enough: http://line25.com/articles/learning-jquery-tutorial-roundup-for-beginners
[07:08:45] <xec> in your console, markus_
[07:09:24] <Byric> Whirl3d: did you connect to sql first?
[07:09:27] <markus_> xec there is a error for a some miliseconds and then the page is reload. i cant read it so fast  :D
[07:10:05] <xec> markus_: you know you can run commands in your console, right?
[07:10:25] <markus_> xec no. can i?
[07:10:47] <Whirl3d> Byric, I believe so. It's hard to say.
[07:10:55] <xec> markus_: what browser are you using
[07:11:15] <Byric> can you erm... collect some data from any table and then send them to html so you see if its working?
[07:11:23] <markus_> chrome
[07:11:28] <Byric> I know how to fetch data using php but jquery is new to me :)
[07:11:38] <Whirl3d> Byric, i used this line to connect o mySQL $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
[07:11:56] <Whirl3d> Then I figure I can use jquery and ajax to get the information from php
[07:12:15] <Byric> well there must be a way but am still a novice at jquery
[07:12:26] <Byric> :) I'd really love to help you but am not the man you want
[07:12:41] <Whirl3d> thanks anyways.
[07:13:27] <Byric> :)
[07:13:44] <xec> markus_: ok, in the inspector console you can type in javascript. http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide17
[07:14:02] <markus_> xec thanks a lot for help!
[07:15:19] <Byric> xec: is there any way I can preserve the space and comma and use that with appendTo or insertAfter?
[07:15:37] <Byric> appendTo and insertAfter is always removing my comma
[07:15:39] <Byric> :(
[07:16:58] <xec> Byric: i havent followed the discussion, what are you asking, exactly?
[07:17:03] <xec> what space and comma?
[07:17:22] <Byric> erm I am trying to put in some html after a anchor in my page
[07:17:38] <Byric> but the comma is always ignored if I use insertAfter or appendTo
[07:17:44] <xec> what comma?
[07:18:12] <Byric> example $(',<a>hello!</a>').insertAfter('.abc a);
[07:18:34] <Byric> that commad just disappears and I only get a <a>hello</a>
[07:18:36] <Byric> ^
[07:18:44] <Byric> comma(,)
[07:19:01] <Whirl3d> that's not valid html, that's why
[07:19:14] <Byric> well how do I make it valid
[07:19:20] <Whirl3d> try <span>,<a>hello!</a></span>
[07:19:21] <Byric> I need to insert a comma
[07:19:31] <Byric> kk lets try
[07:20:00] <Byric> omg!
[07:20:07] <xec> well, it is valid html, but jquery dom methods needs a root element and is trying to figure out what you meant
[07:20:09] <Byric> it works mate! thanks :)
[07:20:32] <Byric> well the final result should be something like this
[07:20:34] <xec> so it figures you only want the anchor
[07:21:03] <Byric> <p class="abc"><a>what</a> , <a>hello!</a></p>
[07:21:07] <Byric> ^
[07:21:26] <xec> you might be better off appending to the innerHTML property of the container instead
[07:21:42] <Byric> I am trying to insert that second anchor(<a>hello</a>) but if the script is disabled then no commad should be there
[07:21:50] <Byric> innerHTML?
[07:22:44] <xec> Byric: what is your starting point, and what do you want the end result to be?
[07:23:05] <Byric> if there is no js enabled I want it to say like this
[07:23:19] <Byric> <p class="abc"><a>What</a> </p>
[07:23:21] <xec> i don't know what will be better for you if i'm not sure exactly what you're doing
[07:23:42] <Byric> but if the jscript is enabled then I want an additional anchor to appear beside the what
[07:23:45] <yannickoo> Hey guys, why does the object don't have a method replaceWidth? var foo = jQuery('a:first'); foo.replaceWidth('<strong>yeah</strong>');
[07:24:02] <shoky_> With?
[07:24:18] <Byric> so my final result(if js is enabled) to be <p class="abc"><a>what</a> , <a>hello!</a></p>
[07:24:18] <yannickoo> fuck
[07:24:37] <yannickoo> shoky++
[07:24:40] <shoky_> ;p
[07:25:23] <Byric> xec: you get the idea?
[07:25:35] <xec> Byric: http://jsfiddle.net/pGNUe/
[07:26:08] <xec> that's what i was thinking, but will only work for one element
[07:26:33] <Byric> only one element?
[07:26:41] <Byric> I have all p with that abc class
[07:27:15] <xec> the [0] returns the native DOM element for the first match, if you have multiple paragraphs i'd use .each
[07:27:24] <Byric> ooo
[07:27:31] <Byric> xec: thanks pal
[07:27:32] <Byric> :)
[07:27:36] <shoky_> doesn't $('.abc a').after(',<a>hello!</a>') work ?
[07:27:38] <Byric> and another quertion
[07:27:55] <xec> Byric: http://jsfiddle.net/pGNUe/1/
[07:28:32] <Byric> xec: nice one :) will use it
[07:28:34] <Byric> now
[07:28:42] <Byric> to my second question if you have time :)
[07:28:45] <shoky_> nvm me
[07:29:16] <Byric> I am trying to toggle a div containing a p element
[07:29:45] <Byric> I am not sure how I should use the .next()
[07:30:19] <xec> toggle as in show/hide?
[07:30:24] <Byric> yes
[07:30:46] <Byric> I can only toggle all the elements using class
[07:30:59] <Byric> but the simple next() isn't doing anything
[07:31:01] <xec> make a fiddle with what you have so far
[07:31:07] <Byric> wait
[07:47:34] <Byric> k done
[07:48:41] <xec> hehe
[07:48:58] <xec> good. wanna send us the link as well? :)
[07:51:50] <Byric> dang!
[07:51:55] <Byric> here's the link
[07:51:58] <Byric> http://jsfiddle.net/Lm5m3/
[07:52:29] <rgr> just wondering if anyone here has experience of using the addToCal plugin? Cant for the life of me get the appendTo and position attributes working as desired. Does it even work?
[07:53:53] <xec> Byric: the .details you click on is inside a paragraph. .next() is for next siblink but there is none
[07:54:17] <xec> Byric: what you'd need to do is find the next sibling of the parent paragraph
[07:54:35] <Byric> I just want the div there to toggle
[07:54:44] <xec> Byric: i often use .closest() for things like this but in this case you could do .parent()
[07:54:57] <Byric> :)
[07:56:23] <xec> also, you don't need to give .next() any argument, all it does is make sure *nothing is selected* if the next element does not match the filter
[07:56:43] <xec> Byric: http://jsfiddle.net/Lm5m3/3/
[07:57:07] <xec> i dunno what you're doing the .html() calls for btw
[07:57:17] <Byric> ?
[07:57:21] <Byric> .html? where?
[07:57:36] <xec> changing the "detail" word to "details" back and forth
[07:57:46] <Byric> heh
[07:57:54] <rgr> xec give the div you want to fade out a special class then just use something other than next on that class or id
[07:57:56] <Byric> the html is used for changing the anchor name
[07:58:13] <rgr> sorry  not xec, but Byric
[07:58:17] <Byric> like when the details is visible its hide and when not,its details
[07:58:23] <xec> rgr: what? why
[07:58:28] <rgr> wasnt aimed at you
[07:58:33] <xec> still, why
[07:58:36] <rgr> why what?
[07:58:48] <xec> why add a class you don't need
[07:59:43] <xec> there are multiple details buttons and i assume they shouldn't hide/show *all* the divs?
[07:59:55] <Byric> rgr: well I could but then I need to add one unique class to each of my elements in there and I got about 35 to list
[07:59:57] <xec> only the corresponding one?
[08:00:05] <Byric> xec: right,just the next immediate one
[08:00:49] <xec> yes, .next() is perfect for this use case, but you can't do .next() on the button, you need to do it on the paragraph
[08:01:15] <rgr> semantically it makes much more sense thats why and for a beginnger its much easier to debug and see it working on a certain class e.g find (".fadeclass"). Just a thought. As it is he could be finding the wrong div. *shrug*
[08:03:12] <rgr> and also, of course, removes the confusion with "next" which demands neighbourliness rather than working on a tagged item found anywhere, depending on the root,  in the hierarchy.
[08:04:26] <Byric> rgr: I'll keep your advice in mind :)
[08:04:35] <Byric> rgr: I got too many elements here
[08:04:38] <rgr> there are of course many ways ;)
[08:04:43] <Byric> ;)
[08:05:06] <Byric> is running java resource intensive?
[08:05:15] <rgr> but in this case you want it to be a child for easier location imo. hang on.
[08:05:54] <xec> rgr: i'm all open to ideas, i just don't see the point. any script is going to rely on the html structure anyway. but please do make a demo so i see what you mean
[08:07:25] <rgr> the point is that next() is concrete "next element". Any change to the dom will break the code. Whereas using find or something in a well defined nested structure with a class tag wont break. ymwyw.
[08:08:10] <xec> "ymwyw"?
[08:09:40] <Byric> omg!
[08:10:03] <Byric> everytime I hit 'Run' in jsfiddle, my PC goes in slowmo for a few seconds
[08:10:17] <Byric> I think its time I get a new pc
[08:10:41] <rgr> you make (of it) what you will .. maybe a little obscure, sorry ;)
[08:11:08] <Byric> :)
[08:13:10] <Byric> xec: hey thanks mate, I really appreciate it :)
[08:13:19] <Byric> rgr: thanks for your advice as well :)
[08:13:22] <Byric> am out for now
[08:13:37] <xec> yw, gl!
[08:15:37] <Byric> yw, gl?
[08:15:40] <Byric> gl= good luck?
[08:15:43] <Byric> what is yw?
[08:16:10] <Famic> you're welcome
[08:16:15] <Byric> ooo
[08:16:18] <Byric> :)
[08:25:55] <Lucky--> Trying to do this the non 'hacky' way of adding html to a string, however having difficulty with it. everything was working with the 'hacky' way. What am I missing? http://pastebin.com/itwEJ0X0
[08:28:16] <MichaelBehan> Lucky--: On a side note - Try storing $('#validationwin') in a variable so you're not continuously doing a lookup whenever you reference it
[08:28:25] <Lucky--> k
[08:28:27] <xec> Lucky--: what is the errors param?
[08:28:37] <Lucky--> its an array of erros
[08:28:40] <Lucky--> *errors
[08:28:46] <rgr> Byric: here is the example from jquery itself. note it using the button selector with first and last. http://jsfiddle.net/vmfcE/4/  and I changed it to use two IDs just as way of example. http://jsfiddle.net/vmfcE/6/
[08:28:56] <rgr> use the second link
[08:29:11] <xec> Lucky--; array of strings?
[08:29:17] <MichaelBehan> Lucky--: Also, window is a terrib/dangerous name for a variable
[08:29:18] <ravenzz> also it coul dbe good to create the new elements collection and append it
[08:29:22] <ravenzz> at the end
[08:29:29] <MichaelBehan> In fact - change window to myWindow or something
[08:29:34] <MichaelBehan> You're conflicting with the JS global namespace
[08:29:35] <Lucky--> MichaelBehan: yea gonna do that now
[08:29:38] <MichaelBehan> cools
[08:31:44] <Lucky--> Jabberwock: http://pastebin.com/5CU31KZe
[08:32:14] <Jabberwock> May I make another suggestion for readability ?
[08:32:25] <Jabberwock> Prefix jquery variables with $ so devs know "Hey this is a jQuery object"
[08:32:29] <Jabberwock> $valwin
[08:33:03] <Jabberwock> Also you don't have to use $(valwin) at that point
[08:33:06] <Jabberwock> just valwin.append() etc
[08:33:09] <Jabberwock> since it's already jQuery
[08:33:58] <Jabberwock> And what happens if you change line nine from 'this' to '$(this)' ?
[08:34:25] <Lucky--> tried both
[08:34:28] <xec> Lucky--: i suspect you want $.each(errors, func) rather than $(errors).each(func)
[08:34:35] <Jabberwock> oh good call.
[08:34:53] <Lucky--> so $. inside a function scope is equivalent to the this pointer?
[08:34:58] <Lucky--> err
[08:34:58] <Lucky--> nm
[08:35:06] <Lucky--> i see what you are saying xec
[08:35:35] <Lucky--> hell this is my first day playing jquery, managed to get http://www.24-7cashadvance.com/2/step1.php working. click address info then type a zipcode in :-P
[08:35:57] <rgr> jquery is a real eye opener alright. Its something special.
[08:36:28] <xec> Lucky--: not bad for first day!
[08:36:34] <Lucky--> :-P
[08:36:39] <Lucky--> then again i havent slept but w/e
[08:36:43] <xec> hehe
[08:36:47] <rgr> lol
[08:36:50] <Lucky--> i just went in "yay new toys" mode
[08:37:18] <rgr> If I was to go back in time and restart learning jquery Id have made a lot more use of the *excellent* jsfiddle.
[08:37:26] <Lucky--> <3 jsfiddle
[08:37:29] <Lucky--> and chrome
[08:38:02] <Lucky--> xec: if you click next on contact info
[08:38:07] <Lucky--> you'll see what im attemping
[08:40:34] <Lucky--> got it: http://pastebin.com/AcmsxuGa
[08:43:36] <xec> Lucky--: "this" inside the loop is the string already, you don't need to reference the array by index
[08:43:42] <xec> but, did it work?
[08:43:49] <Lucky--> xec: i tried it with just this
[08:43:55] <Lucky--> and it gave me 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
[08:46:31] <xec> Lucky--: http://jsfiddle.net/Lm5m3/11/
[08:48:33] <Lucky--> xec: i was trying to get away from html + var + html
[08:48:35] <Lucky--> :-)
[08:48:55] <Lucky--> but i see what you are saying
[08:50:08] <xec> doesnt matter, alternative syntax: http://jsfiddle.net/Lm5m3/12/
[08:50:41] <xec> good for multiple properties on the elements etc
[08:50:53] <xec> but for small stuff i always use string concatenation
[08:51:03] <xec> both easier to read and code imo
[08:51:13] <Lucky--> im a real winner. guess why it didnt work?
[08:51:16] <xec> and performance is not an issue on small stuff ;)
[08:51:24] <Lucky--> yea. accidentally testing on the live server, not my local machine
[08:51:39] <xec> hehehe
[08:54:05] <Lucky--> check the live site out again. try and hit next
[08:54:06] <Lucky--> :-)
[08:54:28] <xec> smooth :)
[08:56:39] <xec> Lucky--: you're missing a <ul> to put the <li>'s in though
[08:57:20] <xec> <div><li></div> is invalid html
[09:02:36] <Lucky--> xec: http://pastebin.com/vNxJaV9E there ya go :-P
[09:06:56] <xec> Lucky--: i assume "valwinul" is a list inside the "valwin"
[09:07:05] <xec> if so yes, better ;)
[09:07:39] <xec> but you're still wrapping them in $() on line 5 and 11
[09:09:04] <xec> it's also common practice to use a variable name like "i" or "index" rather than "me" for index number
[09:09:35] <xec> but in your case you can drop the index entirely and just use this ;)
[09:14:14] <Lucky--> http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp lol. I'm thinking of hooking indeed's api just for autocomplete of job title.
[09:14:36] <Lucky--> talk about massively drain their servers
[09:25:39] <Lucky--> xec: here is the real fun, lets see if we can get http://jsfiddle.net/rp772/21/ to work
[09:25:51] <Lucky--> https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed
[09:32:45] <iwtu> Byric: it's tragic.
[09:46:38] <Lucky--> woot i got this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/rp772/21/ im getting good at this.

[11:11:05] <Axcy> Hello, can someone point me to how I can make a jquery script execute every X seconds? - I'm trying to make a background image cycle script, that changes the background image of the <body> every X seconds
[11:11:45] <luvmyh0nda> are there any tutorials for creating easing/effects/animations?
[11:12:40] <luvmyh0nda> Axcy: setTimeout(), and then set it again within the function
[11:16:02] <Axcy> luvmyh0nda: Thanks, but wont that only make the script execute once?
[11:16:45] <thomasmyrman> Not if you set it again within the function
[11:17:12] <thomasmyrman> Pseudo code: function a() { a(); } // loop
[11:17:30] <thomasmyrman> Recursion
[11:25:22] <Axcy> Is it possible to animate between two background images?
[11:43:48] <Eviltwin> Axcy: Not directly, no
[11:44:10] <Eviltwin> About the best you can do is put another element over with the new image and fade the opacity
[11:59:14] <selwyn> hey guys! this small function is throwing an error which I'm not able to figure out, can some please help. Here is the code http://pastebin.com/swpMZWns
[11:59:26] <selwyn> and I put the error in comments
[12:02:02] <ravenzz> get rid of the round brakets
[12:02:48] <selwyn> as in these - {}
[12:02:53] <xec> your setTimeout is in the middle of an object literal
[12:03:02] <ravenzz> also
[12:03:03] <ravenzz> :p
[12:03:29] <selwyn> I'm lost =(
[12:03:46] <xec> and don't pass a string to setTimeout, pass a function
[12:04:53] <xec> selwyn: i assume you want the setTimeout call to be executed after the ajax success, right?
[12:05:09] <thomedy> i dont know why but i have an append() and then in the div i append i have a load()
[12:05:16] <thomedy> but the first time i load it works
[12:05:23] <thomedy> the second time it seems to break everything
[12:05:24] <xec> selwyn: if so you need it inside of the success function
[12:05:30] <thomedy> it should jus tappend append append
[12:05:34] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[12:05:41] <thomedy> it is uglky right now
[12:05:58] <thomedy> but i have  agreat design inmind and i could use some helep
[12:06:51] <xec> thomedy: can you create a small demo in jsfiddle.net that demonstrates your issue
[12:07:42] <thomedy> ummm yes... the problem with that as far as i know is that load requires a directory and there is a same origin policy if i just grab any old url
[12:07:48] <thomedy> so i dont know if it will work
[12:08:06] <xec> i assumed you meant load as in the event
[12:08:34] <xec> you can simulate an ajax call with a timeout or use the echo service at jsfiddle though
[12:09:39] <thomedy> i have never done that can i jus truna  regular ajax.load and it will do it
[12:12:08] <xec> like you said, you won't be able to do a remote ajax call
[12:12:39] <thomedy> im not sure how to similate an ajax call only actuall ajax
[12:13:25] <thomedy> if i append by it self i get the append
[12:13:29] <thomedy> but when i load
[12:13:38] <xec> show us your code?
[12:13:48] <thomedy> one sec please
[12:15:02] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/Rrxu4zzK
[12:15:09] <thomedy> its really really really simple
[12:15:19] <ravenzz> class =" is wrong
[12:15:58] <thomedy> is it the space between class and =
[12:16:03] <ravenzz> at the 2nd click you will have 2 .new_content elements
[12:16:05] <thomedy> i am teachign myself so id idn't know that was bad
[12:16:25] <ravenzz> np
[12:16:47] <thomedy> okay so heres my thoughts... it seemed like a good idea cuz my design goal is to append and animate
[12:17:00] <thomedy> so 2 seemed fine cuz i was going to .remove() everything but the new one
[12:17:04] <ravenzz> so it will append to both of them
[12:17:22] <ravenzz> uhm
[12:17:29] <thomedy> and i kind of figured that but its not doing that instead its getting rid of both of them
[12:17:46] <ravenzz> hold on
[12:19:10] <thomasmyrman> thomedy: why are you loading a million different style sheets?
[12:19:29] <ravenzz> it should be some cms
[12:19:47] <thomedy> it is a cms and it has taught me alot as far as i know
[12:20:00] <thomedy> however the different style sheets should only load once
[12:20:16] <thomedy> but i tried to load('' + "#div")
[12:20:20] <thomedy> bud i didn't get what i thought
[12:20:29] <thomedy> i was only hoping to load the cotainer div
[12:20:37] <ravenzz> considering that you are learning, I would suggest you to learn it the proper way :=)
[12:20:46] <zerpex> the .load() in jquery, by default, is it then taking the path from 'root' fo the domain? Because at the moment, I have a js/script.js which does load('systeminfo.php'); It loads the file, even when systeminfo.php is in the parent folder of the script.js?
[12:20:52] <ravenzz> just ask if you want us to suggest you some references
[12:20:53] <xec> yeah i agree with ravenzz
[12:21:09] <xec> start with some basics, not a cms and jquery
[12:21:29] <thomasmyrman> ^
[12:21:31] <xec> you need to know html first, then css, then javascript
[12:21:45] <ravenzz> thomedy this is how could it be done, http://jsfiddle.net/466S3/
[12:21:46] <thomedy> i actually am okay at all those but javascript
[12:21:47] <xec> and *then* you look at libraries like jquery
[12:21:51] <thomedy> im teaching myself javascript right now
[12:21:56] <thomedy> when i was learning javascript earlier
[12:22:00] <thomedy> people said just do jquery
[12:22:02] <ravenzz> thomedy read http://wsc.opera.com
[12:22:06] <thomedy> and then looked at me like i was stupid
[12:22:10] <ravenzz> jqueryfundamentals.com
[12:22:11] <thomedy> so ithough i must be wrong
[12:22:27] <ravenzz> and maybe you would like to learn some server side language like php or ruby
[12:22:33] <thomasmyrman> If you don't understand JS, learning jQuery is probably a bad idea
[12:22:42] <thomasmyrman> You CAN do it, it's up to you
[12:22:50] <Haprog> thomedy: I suggest taking a look at these few links: http://bit.ly/bundles/haprog/1
[12:23:13] <zerpex> I did learn jquery before javascript.. and thats why I hate javascript now.. because things is easier in jquery.. So it's harder to learn javascript after jquery I think :)
[12:23:21] <thomedy> thank you i will im learning awefully fast fortunately for me i have c++ as a background from college
[12:23:39] <thomedy> can i ask why people are so down on cms's
[12:23:46] <thomasmyrman> zerpex: that's probably true. But understanding js is easier if you learn... js! :)
[12:23:48] <thomedy> it seems that people hat them
[12:23:59] <ravenzz> thomedy they are with some cms
[12:24:21] <ravenzz> and also it clear enough that you can have a lot of useless crap
[12:24:27] <ravenzz> if you are using a cms
[12:24:30] <zerpex> thomasmyrman, I think there is a big difference between jquery and pure javascript :)
[12:24:33] <thomasmyrman> thomedy: for me, it's the fact that I don't like handing over things to a CMS, I like coding things myself
[12:24:33] <xec> thomedy: if you really wanna jump straight to jquery, stick to the basic methods first, like .append() and .appendTo() and $.ajax() and .on() - the .load() tries to do too much for it's own good imo
[12:24:47] <thomedy> my only problem with cms is that im used to writingmy own code in college i did robotics
[12:24:48] <thomedy> and what not
[12:25:05] <thomasmyrman> zerpex: jQuery IS javascript, it's not a different language
[12:25:06] <thomedy> but i figured its normal that you dont get to create from scratch all the time and i hav eto aget used to it
[12:25:22] <ravenzz> thomedy you are correct
[12:25:24] <zerpex> thomasmyrman: I know ..
[12:25:25] <thomedy> i can do all of those
[12:25:26] <systemfault> thomasmyrman: People always seem to mix up JS and DOM
[12:25:26] <thomedy> actually
[12:25:39] <thomedy> i have neverr tried append to
[12:25:44] <thomedy> but usually just .ajax
[12:25:44] <ravenzz> but there are quite good cms or you can even use a framework
[12:25:46] <Haprog> jQuery IS "just" JavaScript but even if you like to do everything JS in jQuery you really should learn the syntax and peculiarities of basic JavaScript well first to be able to use and understand it and jQuery better.
[12:25:49] <systemfault> jQuery "improves" the DOM...
[12:25:51] <systemfault> Not JS
[12:25:54] <thomedy> load i m pretty sure i have done before too
[12:26:16] <thomasmyrman> I agree with Haprog :)
[12:26:24] <zerpex> But in general I hate JS and jquery :)
[12:26:39] <ravenzz> js is sweet
[12:26:41] <thomasmyrman> JS is awesome
[12:26:41] <systemfault> If you use jquery but don't know JS… you suck at both.
[12:26:46] <systemfault> It's as simple as that
[12:26:51] <thomedy> im googling event.preventDefault
[12:26:53] <thomedy> it seems awesome
[12:27:04] <Haprog> I used to hate JS too, but it was about 10 years ago, and the situation was quite different then. :P
[12:27:11] <zerpex> js is a big performance issue because even people who think they know how to do JS, actually doesn't know about performance.. which is bad
[12:27:20] <Haprog> Now I love jQuery
[12:27:20] <systemfault> Haprog: The tooling was awful back then.. :/
[12:27:44] <thomedy> one of the benefits i find with cms is the speed with which you can push something to gether and the amount of voracious learning i can atain from it
[12:28:11] <zerpex> I love CMS systems :P
[12:28:16] <thomasmyrman> You'll learn a lot from doing things yourself, I believe
[12:28:17] <zerpex> When I build it myself ll
[12:28:18] <thomedy> i am already doing oop php and learning the details of the dom and solid jquery.. im not amazing bu ti think that i have learned faster than expected
[12:28:33] <thomedy> i get alot of crap from the people who do drupal with me for doing so much myself
[12:28:38] <thomedy> i write my own themes
[12:28:40] <thomedy> modules
[12:28:42] <thomedy> everything
[12:28:46] <thomedy> i just want things perfect
[12:28:52] <thomedy> that pushes me even faster
[12:28:55] <thomasmyrman> Not "everything" ;)
[12:28:59] <systemfault> Then perhaps, you shouldn't use a CMS...
[12:29:02] <thomasmyrman> ^
[12:29:06] <systemfault> If you end up rewriting most of it.
[12:29:12] <zerpex> then he shouldn't do web stuff
[12:29:16] <zerpex> because it's never perfect
[12:29:18] <Haprog> Maybe a framework would work better
[12:29:25] <systemfault> Yeah.
[12:29:25] <thomedy> but i taught myself how to use what are those pretty menus that pop up with :hover
[12:29:32] <thomedy> by reading the code in my cms
[12:29:34] <thomedy> stuff like that
[12:30:26] <thomasmyrman> I don't speak from experience, but my guess is that analyzing someone elses code is not a good way to learn. It will teach you how to hack things together but not fully understand it.
[12:30:34] <thomasmyrman> But I could be talking out of my arse here
[12:30:47] <zerpex> anyways, by default will the .load('myfile.php'); load via the root of the site? Because I can't see why it works now..
[12:30:58] <thomedy> yeah but i also know people dont like helping sometimes and realy its not anyones job but mine to learn it so i dont wnat to push  that on if i dont have to
[12:31:13] <thomedy> like what i aske dhere for example i spent 3days trying different approaches
[12:31:18] <thomedy> before i came here to ask
[12:31:19] <systemfault> thomasmyrman: No.. you're right.
[12:31:22] <zerpex> thomasmyrman: it's like doing asp.net.. you'll never learn to code, if you use it :p
[12:31:31] <systemfault> thomasmyrman: Even more right if you speak of anything written in PHP.
[12:31:35] <thomasmyrman> That's the definiton of hacking something together though.
[12:31:37] <ravenzz> thomedy it is good to ask
[12:31:43] <ravenzz> or read np
[12:31:46] <thomedy> i wrote a small php script that saves the url to a temporary page and then loaded the temporary page
[12:31:54] <thomedy> but its taking to much of a load time and i dontlike it
[12:32:00] <thomedy> it feels like hackery
[12:32:03] <thomedy> but i was cool
[12:32:19] <thomedy> down side of cms
[12:32:32] <thomedy> things are broken that arent my code sometimes and i hate debugging someone elses code
[12:32:49] <thomedy> so 2 weeks ago i taught myself to resize andcrop images in php
[12:32:52] <thomasmyrman> zerpex: does anyone even use ASP.net?
[12:32:53] <thomedy> and it works great
[12:32:57] <zerpex> thomedy: actually, it can be quiet useful, I did kind of the same, where I etc save a file, locally to my system, and then renew it every 5 mins.. I used curl do do it, because I could load 3rd party javascript files to my own domain sharding :P
[12:33:05] <aphid> thomasmyrman: stackoverflow is written in it
[12:33:10] <thomedy> i used crul too
[12:33:15] <thomedy> i still have the code
[12:33:18] <thomasmyrman> aphid: Interesting
[12:33:21] <zerpex> thomasmyrman: I did 'learn' it on my education.. I've never used it, because it was just stupid
[12:33:39] <thomedy> okay i have to go to my other job
[12:33:50] <thomedy> i have 2 day jobs until i get this sollid
[12:33:53] <zerpex> cya thomedy
[12:33:59] <thomedy> and then i plan on runnning myself full time
[12:34:01] <thomasmyrman> Bye :)
[12:34:04] <thomedy> god i cant wait for that t
[12:34:10] <thomedy> than k you for the preventDefault
[12:34:13] <thomedy> it seems pretty cool
[12:34:47] <ravenzz> good luck
[12:35:08] <thomasmyrman> I haven't investigated asp.net much, but I've always avoided it because it seemed like crap... perhaps it has some value that I haven't discovered yet :P
[12:36:14] <zerpex> thomasmyrman: it has the value, that when you finally finish, a page, you'll be like "How can this even work? I haven't done any programming'
[12:36:24] <zerpex> and the people who use it, will never learn how a login system etc works
[12:36:39] <ravenzz> i feel like that you will be coding in visual studio and you'll have an huge amount of crap
[12:36:50] <ravenzz> but it is just a feeling
[12:36:58] <zerpex> ravenzz, exactly :P
[12:37:09] <thomasmyrman> haha
[12:37:10] <zerpex> and then visual studio is stupid expensive
[12:37:17] <ravenzz> like the word generated markup
[12:37:38] <zerpex> my teachers from my education was like "Dreamweaver is so bad because it writes all your code!"
[12:37:43] <zerpex> ehmm.. yeah
[12:37:43] <thomasmyrman> zerpex: how does that work? not programming?
[12:37:56] <aphid> I dislike it for being an ugly proprietary stack, not because it's useless or incapable of being used for good projects.
[12:38:41] <zerpex> thomasmyrman: you can actually do a website, without doing programming in .net, because they have a control: <asp:Login></asp:Login> which creates a full login system for you
[12:38:59] <thomasmyrman> LOL
[12:39:14] <thomasmyrman> Oh my...
[12:40:12] <thomedy> you know maybe im wrong but i do think i want to append
[12:40:15] <zerpex> aand, I found like 20 security bugs in the system
[12:40:28] <thomedy> i want to add an animation so that it scrolls left or right to the new page
[12:40:34] <thomedy> that was the wholepoint of the design
[12:40:41] <thomedy> i have a hard time quiting
[12:40:48] <thomedy> i really should go i just have so mucht o do
[12:41:01] <zerpex> isn't there a documentation for jquery, as extensive as the php one? Because I can't see how the .load() works.. I can only see in my code, that it works weird
[12:41:05] <thomedy> that attr thing is faster so i will do that instead but its doing the same thing i was already doing
[12:41:25] <ravenzz> ?load @ zerpex ?
[12:41:27] <bot-t> ravenzz, Couldn't find "load @ zerpex ?" in jQuery Docs.
[12:41:29] <ravenzz> ?load @ zerpex
[12:41:30] <bot-t> zerpex, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:41:49] <ravenzz> ?jQuery,load @ zerpex
[12:41:50] <bot-t> zerpex, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:41:55] <ravenzz> that one
[12:42:04] <systemfault> Zerpex: http://jqapi.com/
[12:43:50] <systemfault> Zerpex: .load is simple.. it does an ajax call, get the html content, stripts all scripts… create a html fragment of it then select the requested node within it.
[12:43:57] <systemfault> *strips
[12:44:11] <faryshta> What does the callback function do?
[12:44:29] <faryshta> https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery/test-jhp/src/callbacks.js
[12:45:18] <zerpex> systemfault: my problem, I have js/script.js, which contains a function saying $('.serverinfo').load('systeminfo.php'); my systeminfo.php is placed at /systeminfo.php (1 folder above the script.js) but it still loads the php file.. if I do .load('/systeminfo.php'); or .load('../systeminfo.php'); It still works :S
[12:46:02] <systemfault> Zerpex: Okay o_O
[12:46:20] <systemfault> Zerpex: You sure caching is disabled in your browser? (Just in case)
[12:46:38] <zerpex> I have disabled cache in my browser always :P
[12:46:55] <zerpex> Working as a performance engineer on daily basis, so having caching disabled is important :D
[12:47:00] <systemfault> :)
[12:48:51] <zerpex> but if I do /js/systeminfo.php it stops working :D
[12:49:10] <johnkpaul> faryshta: it's an internal function to keep track of callback lists
[12:49:13] <johnkpaul> faryshta: http://api.jquery.com/category/callbacks-object/ for info
[12:51:55] <zerpex> maybe I shouldn't care :P
[12:52:04] <vlad27aug> zerpex: that is because the "current directory" in a javascript file is considered to be the original file that included the javascript file...my guess is that that one is a php (or whatever) located in the root of the domain
[12:52:21] <vlad27aug> so /myfile.php or ../myfile.php will still remain in the root
[12:52:46] <zerpex> ahh
[12:52:48] <vlad27aug> while /js/myfile.php isn't
[12:53:02] <zerpex> at least, my performance dashboard works now! :D
[12:55:00] <maria_zk> could some please help me? I am trying to take this endpoint http://nodetw.cloudfoundry.com/scorpions with ajax in my page. However this will not work http://pastebin.com/3WzFSpQ1
[12:55:15] <maria_zk> it fails silently and have no idea what to do
[12:56:00] <zerpex> Goodnighty guys :)
[12:56:15] <maria_zk> sorry http://pastebin.com/AC2tt5QN
[12:57:01] <johnkpaul> maria_zk: error needs to be a function, not an alert() which returns undefined I believe
[12:58:15] <maria_zk> thank you for your reply
[12:58:50] <maria_zk> alert works, meaning that it returns an alert 'err'
[12:59:02] <maria_zk> not sure why though, any ideas?
[12:59:31] <aaronmcadam> maria_zk: see ?sop
[12:59:31] <bot-t> maria_zk, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[12:59:53] <johnkpaul> maria_zk: it will always alert err, even if there is no error
[13:00:03] <johnkpaul> because you are executing line 7 of your paste immediately
[13:00:10] <johnkpaul> not only if there is an error
[13:00:16] <johnkpaul> you need to wrap it in a function, like you do in the success case
[13:00:27] <aaronmcadam> or just
[13:00:36] <maria_zk> i see. then the alert for data will show : object object. how can i see the object?
[13:00:41] <aaronmcadam> console
[13:00:52] <aaronmcadam> console.dir( object )
[13:01:01] <aphid> don't use alert -- console.log(stuff)
[13:01:01] <maria_zk> aaronmcadam: i am using http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/
[13:01:06] <aaronmcadam> ah
[13:01:08] <aaronmcadam> cheater
[13:01:09] <aaronmcadam> haha
[13:01:13] <aphid> or dir, wahtever
[13:01:17] <maria_zk> hehe
[13:01:19] <aaronmcadam> I use the yql plugin, that's what he uses
[13:01:34] <maria_zk> so console.dir( data )
[13:01:36] <aaronmcadam> yep
[13:03:19] <aaronmcadam> ?eval eval
[13:03:21] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: <function eval() {[native code]}>
[13:03:33] <aaronmcadam> ah, you're alive
[13:03:36] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[13:03:37] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[13:03:42] <aaronmcadam> goot bot-t
[13:04:31] <maria_zk> :( nothing in the coonsole
[13:05:17] <maria_zk> error: alert('err'),
[13:05:19] <maria_zk>     success: function(data) {
[13:05:20] <maria_zk>         console.dir( data );
[13:05:21] <maria_zk>     },
[13:05:55] <aaronmcadam> error will only fire if there's a 500 or something
[13:06:08] <maria_zk> ok how can i get my data?
[13:06:14] <aaronmcadam> not if the request simply didn't return anything
[13:06:23] <aaronmcadam> your error callback is still wrong
[13:06:51] <aaronmcadam> don't you need to pass any params to your endpoint
[13:07:36] <aaronmcadam> ah ok it returns json
[13:07:43] <aaronmcadam> so set dataType : 'json'
[13:07:46] <maria_zk> well, scorpion is the parameter. i hardcode it for now
[13:07:59] <aaronmcadam> or use see ?getJSON
[13:07:59] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[13:08:59] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax
[13:08:59] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:09:42] <maria_zk> thank you, but the docs didn;t help me :(
[13:09:58] <maria_zk> also tried with getjson but no luck
[13:10:00] <aaronmcadam> specify that it's json
[13:10:13] <aaronmcadam> don't u need to call the plugin?
[13:10:19] <aaronmcadam> or does it override global ajax opts?
[13:10:52] <aaronmcadam> is *anything* getting called?
[13:11:10] <aaronmcadam> add `console.log('test')` do your success callbacks
[13:11:12] <maria_zk> i am calling the plugin... I include it in headers. not sure if there is something more i need to do
[13:11:30] <aaronmcadam> that's not the same as calling it
[13:11:40] <aaronmcadam> you're still using jq's native ajax function there
[13:11:55] <aaronmcadam> i'm sure james has actually made it a plugin
[13:12:18] <maria_zk> success: function(data) {
[13:12:19] <maria_zk> console.log('test');
[13:12:21] <maria_zk>     }, fails
[13:12:23] <maria_zk> yes?
[13:12:30] <aaronmcadam> nothing comes up?
[13:12:49] <maria_zk> nope.
[13:13:05] <maria_zk> maybe i am using the plugin wrong? it is included.
[13:13:06] <aaronmcadam> are you monitoring your XHRs in your browser
[13:13:11] <aaronmcadam> you have to call it
[13:13:27] <aaronmcadam> simply including a plugin file is *not* how you use query plugins
[13:13:31] <aaronmcadam> jquery*
[13:14:13] <maria_zk> ok i thought it was taking over...
[13:14:21] <maria_zk> so how should I do it?
[13:14:35] <maria_zk> it doesn't mention anything in the example
[13:14:56] <maria_zk> With this mod, any GET request made via jQuery.ajax to another domain will work
[13:15:31] <aaronmcadam> right ye
[13:15:38] <aaronmcadam> it does modify the native ajax method
[13:15:45] <maria_zk> cool
[13:16:00] <aaronmcadam> what browser are u using
[13:16:06] <maria_zk> firefox
[13:16:06] <caniuse> maria_zk: http://wil.to/_/firefox.gif
[13:16:11] <aaronmcadam> you need to monitor your network traffic
[13:16:15] <aaronmcadam> and see if there's any issues
[13:16:33] <aaronmcadam> in firebug
[13:16:58] <aaronmcadam> fuck drupal :D
[13:17:03] <thomasmyrman> :D
[13:17:26] <aaronmcadam> that fox is fucked up
[13:17:41] <thomasmyrman> caniuse: did you create the website with the same name?
[13:18:06] <aaronmcadam> i thought that was Paul Irish
[13:18:21] <aaronmcadam> maybe
[13:19:32] <maria_zk> LOVE IT :)
[13:19:55] <maria_zk> fuck drupal? why!?!?!?!
[13:20:11] <nullpointer> why not fuck drupal?
[13:20:27] <tw2113> drupal > joomla
[13:20:35] <systemfault> Well.. drupal in written in PHP… says it all
[13:20:44] <faryshta> johnkpaul, Where is defined the pile of functions? I am trying to create a jquery like library for php5.4
[13:20:52] <aphid> wikipedia is written in php, says it all ...
[13:20:56] <nullpointer> coding custom modules tho.. kinda sucks balls
[13:21:20] <systemfault> aphid: If you ever looked at WP's code.. you'd be crying right now.
[13:21:32] <systemfault> the_lulz()
[13:21:36] <aphid> s/wikipedia/facebook
[13:21:44] <johnkpaul> dabear: "the pile of functions"?
[13:21:52] <tw2113> there tends to be either love or hate of php, no middle ground
[13:22:09] <systemfault> tw2113: Only PHP programmers love PHP… everyone else hates it.
[13:22:19] <systemfault> (PHP programmers are programmers who only knows PHP)
[13:22:19] <thomasmyrman> haha
[13:22:23] <nullpointer> it doesn't really matter what cms one uses as long as u don't have to start extending it
[13:22:29] <aphid> nobody actually hates php, people just love to troll.
[13:22:43] <thomasmyrman> Doesn't FB convert their PHP from another language or something?
[13:22:48] <aaronmcadam> the whole point of a CMS is the ability t*to* extend it
[13:22:50] * tw2113 knows some people that seem to loathe js too
[13:22:58] <aaronmcadam> unless you never have to do bespoke work?
[13:23:03] <nullpointer> yea exactly:D
[13:23:11] <aaronmcadam> no, they just use an optimiser
[13:23:12] <systemfault> thomasmyrman: Facebook uses normal PHP… they created a compiler for it though..
[13:23:14] <aaronmcadam> hiphop
[13:23:17] <aaronmcadam> yep
[13:23:27] <thomasmyrman> That was the one :D
[13:23:27] <nullpointer> i think facebook has their own compiler
[13:23:40] <maria_zk> aaronmcadam: no response... still.. :(
[13:23:44] <systemfault> nullpointer: Yeah, like aaronmcadam said, it's HipHop
[13:23:45] <maria_zk> any ideas?
[13:23:50] <aaronmcadam> that sucks maria_zk
[13:23:58] <aaronmcadam> use a proxy
[13:24:02] <aaronmcadam> on the server side :p
[13:24:06] <maria_zk> i mean, besides changing career and all...
[13:24:44] <tw2113> i may actually get to work on things today. no guarantee
[13:24:56] <tw2113> but if i can keep myself away from downloaded tv shows, it's more likely to happen
[13:25:13] <thomasmyrman> oh crap.. thanks for reminding me tw2113
[13:25:22] <nullpointer> probably not gonna happen then
[13:25:28] <thomasmyrman> Won't have time for anything else now
[13:25:37] <tw2113> plus game of thrones tonight
[13:25:41] <thomasmyrman> \o/
[13:25:49] <thomasmyrman> Yep, definitely not doing anything else
[13:26:06] <tw2113> and early next month....True Blood starts up again
[13:26:18] <thomasmyrman> I think I'm quiting True Blood though
[13:26:23] <nullpointer> it's kinda nice in the off-season
[13:26:37] <nullpointer> i might actually get to see the sun and the outside
[13:27:35] <tw2113> but how would you code with all the glare on your screen nullpointer ?
[13:28:12] <aaronmcadam> true blood is for girls, I'm sorry
[13:28:15] <aaronmcadam> hehehe
[13:28:58] <tw2113> i can live with that belief
[13:29:04] <thomasmyrman> True Blood started out good, now it's just horrible...
[13:29:06] <tw2113> i'm just glad i didn't somehow catch Twilight
[13:29:56] <tw2113> i'd start questioning my sexuality if i did
[13:32:03] <aphid> i wonder how many times joffrey will get slapped tonight
[13:33:06] <tw2113> can't spell pimp with out imp
[13:33:54] <aphid> oh neat, grrm wrote next week's episode
[13:34:45] * tw2113 has been listening to the first audiobook lately
[13:35:07] <tw2113> i started out with the show, and now i'm catching up with the proper text
[13:35:11] <aphid> one of the guys who did most of the audiobooks is the pyromancer halyne in season 2
[13:35:27] <aphid> after season 1 i read all 5 books, it's like crack
[13:35:35] <nullpointer> tw2113: think i'll have to get a glare-proof screen
[13:35:56] <tw2113> a book per season is convenient imho
[13:36:06] <aphid> they're splitting book 3 into two seasons, it's too big
[13:36:37] <tw2113> i have to wonder how far they'll go with the tv version, i've heard the author is working on book 7?
[13:38:02] <aphid> he's working on 6, the 7th will be the last one.     having read them i'm not sure how well they'd transfer to tv
[13:38:43] <aphid> things get pretty ugly.  even compared to what we've seen.
[13:39:47] <tw2113> impressive given how ugly it's already been
[13:45:53] <nullpointer> wondering if it would be fun to start coding some scals
[13:45:56] <nullpointer> scala
[13:52:43] <systemfault> Scala… meh.
[13:55:03] <ragnok> you are only allowed to code js, that is node.js :D
[14:04:51] <nullpointer> is this the code for a pure-hearted jquery ninja?
[14:06:39] <scalability-junk> hey I'm trying to check a checkbox with jquery, but couldn't find a suitable solution yet, any idea?
[14:08:24] <Haprog> scalability-junk: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[14:10:01] <opius> i have a strange problem which i can't find the solution for.. it's with .load or .get .. works fine in everything except IE :/ tried alot of "solutions" with disabling ie cache etc..
[14:10:08] <anli__> When I press enter in a autocomplete dropdown to select an item, it seems that an enter press is also delivered to the text box, how can I not make that happen?
[14:10:08] <opius> it just refuse to work
[14:11:51] <andr0id1> does anyone knows what is the a4 printable size in pixels?
[14:13:35] <scalability-junk> hey I'm trying to check a checkbox with jquery, but couldn't find a suitable solution yet, any idea?
[14:14:06] <systemfault> scalability-junk: .prop('checked', true)
[14:14:12] <scalability-junk> thanks
[14:16:16] <scalability-junk> mh doesn't quite seem to work as espected ^^
[14:17:43] <scalability-junk> it's turning into some sort of an input field... strange
[14:19:03] <scalability-junk> solved it thanks
[14:19:52] <Haprog> scalability-junk: I already linked you and yet you asked again. you should learn to read..
[14:20:00] <Haprog> about checking the checkbox
[14:20:26] <scalability-junk> Haprog, oh sorry, I didn't see it in my log, I think I timedout before sorry :(
[14:20:43] <Haprog> ah, didn't see you rejoining
[14:21:16] <scalability-junk> ^^ thanks anyways ;)
[14:21:20] <Haprog> :)
[14:27:51] <tw2113> :D
[14:28:53] <tw2113> i just got a twitter reply from the actress playing Yara Greyjoy
[14:28:59] <aphid> oh?
[14:29:23] <aphid> asha greyjoy goddamnit :P
[14:29:27] <tw2113> found out she's on twitter and hit follow, felt like asking if she'd be on tonight's episode a fair amount
[14:29:52] <aphid> apparently the guy who plays hodor runs a wow guild
[14:30:01] <tw2113> it's been a good week on twitter for me
[14:30:01] <aphid> and will tweet HODOR! at you if you ask nicely
[14:30:16] <tw2113> a tweet from her, a couple days ago i got a tweet reply from Zeldman
[14:30:18] <anli__> I want to distinguish between enterpress and mouseclick autocomplete selections
[14:30:26] <anli__> Is that possible?
[14:51:11] <opius> to add more to the weirdness .. it works on my iis-server but not apache
[14:55:45] <Bozaj> yo guys how i can make a simple comet for a chat ... that will update my foreach loop ?
[15:02:03] <Jon47> zeldmannnn *shakes fist*
[15:16:13] <horkling> is it possible to scroll down a single page using a combobox?
[15:16:19] <horkling> if so, how would one go about doing this?
[15:16:32] <horkling> my problem is this: http://pointstackers.com/offers.php
[15:16:50] <horkling> the plethora of flags at the top need to be turned into a combobox instead...for neatness sake =(
[15:16:54] <faryshta> john-dev are you jeresig?
[15:17:41] <whateverb> why isnt my little function working for separate divs? I want to set every rows minimum height separately for eah row's 'ul'  http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/19/
[15:24:02] <eeklund> Does anyone know if there is a jQuery validation plug-in channel?
[15:25:28] <faryshta> eeklund, #jquery-dev
[15:25:42] <tw2113> faryshta i think that's jquery core dev discussion
[15:25:45] <tw2113> not plugin discussion
[15:26:36] <faryshta> tw2113,  #jquery-dev es jQuery development chat. Support chat (using jQuery, writing plugins, or other inquiries)
[15:26:43] <faryshta> tw2113, that is written on the topic
[15:27:35] <tw2113> logic in my head says it'd still be a question better fit for in here
[15:27:40] <tw2113> but what do i know
[15:28:04] <tw2113> is eeklund trying to write a plugin or use one?
[15:29:32] <eeklund> I'm trying to use the jQuery validation plug-in.  I want to run additional code when the validation is triggered but I am not finding much via search as I don't know exactly what to search.
[15:31:29] <looi> how can I set a favicon with jquery?
[15:31:59] <looi> Doing the obvious $("link[rel=icon]").prop('href', "/path/to/icon.png") doesn't work
[15:32:12] <looi> (DOM is updated, but favicon doesn't change)
[15:32:33] <eeklund> I have a form that will be used for entering a proposed committee and when the form loads it pulls in a list of advisers that a student has assigned.  When the form is submitted I want to verify that all the advisers are in the proposed committee.  I can compare array elements but I can't figure out how to wire the check into the plug-in as the adviser fields are all dynamic and hidden from view.
[15:34:22] <eeklund> Is there a way to run an additional method that isn't tied to a visible element without overriding the default behavior of the ignore option?
[15:50:42] <Stephen> eeklund, ok, let's continue
[15:51:39] <Stephen> regarding "With regard to the validation plugin, I am trying to figure out if there is a way to run a validation rule that isn't tied to a static form element.  Does anyone know if you can run a function that would poll dynamic hidden fields and compare them to static ones?"
[15:51:51] <Stephen> Let's stick to one thing at a time, we'll get to that next
[15:51:58] <Stephen> So, anonymous functions.
[16:07:09] <Pr3fix> Hey guys, im having trouble using jquery's getJSON. Trying to query wikipedia but I don't think I'm getting a result. Any help? Here's my function http://jsfiddle.net/6bpFq/1/
[16:10:04] <johnkpaul-afk> Pr3fix: http://jsfiddle.net/6bpFq/2/
[16:10:17] <johnkpaul-afk> you need to add callback=? to the URL to trigger jsonp
[16:10:43] <Pr3fix> OHH
[16:10:48] <Pr3fix> wow, can't believe I missed that
[16:10:50] <Pr3fix> thank you :)
[16:11:15] <johnkpaul-afk> np, Pr3fix, have fun
[16:11:35] <Pr3fix> johnkpaul-afk: Thanks, have a great evening! :)
[16:11:40] <owen1> i try to use jquery 1.7.2 localy (not hosted) and see this in the console: lib/images/ajax-loader.gif 404 (Not Found)    what is this file and where do i get it?
[16:12:09] <owen1> i another similar message: images/icons-18-white.png 404 (Not Found)
[16:12:10] <Pr3fix> sounds like a missing file, try redownload jquery?
[16:12:22] <Pr3fix> did you download it in a package?
[16:12:31] <Pr3fix> because I dont think jquery should require any images by default..
[16:12:42] <owen1> Pr3fix: i didn't download anything but the js file
[16:16:26] <owen1> Pr3fix: here is the offending line in the minified file: .ui-icon-loading{background:url(images/ajax-loader.gif)
[16:16:38] <owen1> so where do i get those missing files from?
[16:17:11] <Pr3fix> thats really odd, as far as I know jquery shouldnt be requiring any files from you.. I'm new to jQuery myself though so I can't be of much help, sorry. :(
[16:17:24] <Pr3fix> Anyone else know what's up for owen1?
[16:17:58] <johnkpaul-afk> owen1: you're using jquery mobile, not plain jquery
[16:18:17] <johnkpaul> jquery mobile needs more than just the javascript file
[16:18:43] <owen1> johnkpaul: oh. where do i get the images?
[16:18:49] <owen1> is there i link somewhere?
[16:19:06] <owen1> oh. so u think it's the jquery mobile!
[16:19:10] <owen1> i use it
[16:19:26] <johnkpaul> owen1: where did you get your files? you can find all of the theme stuff http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[16:20:23] <owen1> johnkpaul: yeah. i got it from there. but only got the js and css files
[16:20:34] <tw2113> and it's looking for an image
[16:20:58] <johnkpaul> owen1: there's a zip file on that page that has everything
[16:24:32] <Stephen> la
[16:28:27] <owen1> johnkpaul: thanks! in related note - is it better to host all the jquery/jquery mobile files in the cloud? it means i'll have more requests to get static files, right?
[16:28:53] <owen1> the other option is to have 1 giant js file and 1 giant css file served from my own server, right?
[16:29:16] <owen1> i ask about performance
[16:33:19] <johnkpaul> owen1: concatenating your javascript and having fewer http requests is definitely a good thing
[16:33:40] <johnkpaul> I wouldn't worry about adding your library files unless you're planning on not updating your code for a long time, which isn't really possible nowadays
[16:34:33] <owen1> johnkpaul: so u'r saying it's fine to host the jquery on the cloud?
[16:34:44] <johnkpaul> what do you mean when you say "on the cloud"?
[16:35:00] <owen1> google or wherever it's hosted
[16:35:20] <owen1> and my app specific files will be served in separate request
[16:35:43] <johnkpaul> you should have your app specific files in a separate request wether or not you're hosting jquery from some third party cdn
[16:36:34] <johnkpaul> whether or not you use the cdn is a more complex question that you can google for, I usually do not use them and rather host them myself
[16:36:39] <owen1> johnkpaul: oh. i thought it might be more efficient to aggregate ALL my js files (including the jquery) in 1 big file.
[16:36:43] <johnkpaul> no, don't do that
[16:36:55] <johnkpaul> because chances are that you're going to change your app code
[16:36:57] <owen1> the same for css files
[16:36:58] <johnkpaul> but not your jquery code
[16:37:04] <owen1> johnkpaul: of course
[16:37:06] <owen1> so what?
[16:37:13] <owen1> i'll repackes them
[16:37:16] <johnkpaul> why force the user to download jquery again
[16:37:44] <johnkpaul> there's a balancing act here, you shouldn't make many files to download because of http overhead, but you don't want too few because you have to invaldate everything when you invlidate anything
[16:37:52] <owen1> johnkpaul: i guess i am the onlyone that delete everything when i close the browser..
[16:38:08] <johnkpaul> :) you're of a rare breed
[16:38:27] <owen1> johnkpaul-afk: got it. thanks a lot for the insights
[16:39:22] <owen1> johnkpaul-afk: i decided download the jquery files since i sometimes hack offline on a bus/train etc
[16:40:03] <Pr3fix> Hey guys I'm having trouble with working with JSON data ( yeah I'm a noobie ). Basically I'm trying to query wikipedia but I'm not sure how to handle the response. Here's a link to my current function, and beneath that is an example of the JSON that I'm trying to manipulate - any tips much appreciated :) http://jsfiddle.net/6bpFq/4/
[16:41:34] <Pr3fix> I just want to store the title and extract responses in a var to display on the page but I can't figure out how to address that in the jquery
[16:48:02] <SirSpam> Is it possible to download a specific subset of jquery. One that only has, say, the ajax functions?
[16:48:16] <Mylesmadness> Is anyone here familiar with roundabout(http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)? I'm having a an issue where the stuff in the boxes doesnt scale with the boxes, and breaks layout
[16:55:41] <Pr3fix> how do I access the value of JSON objects when one has been returned with getJSON?
[16:55:55] <Pr3fix> like the value of the child nodes
[16:56:10] <systemfault> Pr3fix: No such thing as a JSON object… getJSON returns a javascript object..
[16:56:20] <systemfault> So you just use it like a javascript object.
[16:56:27] <Pr3fix> systemfault: correct, my apologies
[16:56:36] <Pr3fix> that's what I've been trying to do but it keeps saying that it is undefined?
[16:56:53] <systemfault> Pr3fix: Could you show us the content of the JSON?
[16:57:09] <Pr3fix> systemfault: sure one second, thank you
[16:57:56] <Pr3fix> systemfault: I've pasted it into the "javascript" box here: http://jsfiddle.net/aEccW/
[16:58:08] <systemfault> Pr3fix: What value do you want to access?
[16:58:10] <Pr3fix> systemfault: I just want to access the title and tract portions
[16:58:17] <Pr3fix> systemfault: *extract
[16:59:10] <systemfault> jsonVariable.query.pages['116069'].title I guess
[16:59:26] <systemfault> jsonVariable being what is returned by getJSON
[17:00:24] <Pr3fix> systemfault: thank you for the help, I'll try it :) although the pages['116069'] portion changes depending on the query..
[17:00:50] <Pr3fix> systemfault: so I'm not sure how I would access it explicitly like that without knowing what the user queried beforehand
[17:01:41] <systemfault> Pr3fix: There's no clean way :( You would use a for/in or perhaps $.each
[17:02:07] <systemfault> Pr3fix: Can you modify the format on the server?
[17:02:13] <Pr3fix> systemfault: gahh why does the wikipedia api need to be such a pain D:
[17:02:19] <systemfault> Ahhh.. It's wikipedia
[17:02:20] <Pr3fix> systemfault: yes! JSON, XML, the usual suspects
[17:03:08] <Pr3fix> back, sorry about that
[17:03:25] <systemfault> Pr3fix: Are you sure you'll always get a single "page" per query?
[17:03:47] <Pr3fix> pretty sure; and if I don't I only need the first one
[17:05:50] <systemfault> Pr3fix: http://jsfiddle.net/aEccW/3/
[17:06:45] <Pr3fix> systemfault: of perfect, thank you so much -- going to give that a shot and will report back.
[17:06:54] <systemfault> Cool :)
[17:06:54] <Pr3fix> systemfault: Thank you for your assistance :)
[17:09:42] <Mylesmadness> Is anyone here familiar with roundabout(http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)? I'm having a an issue where the stuff in the boxes doesnt scale with the boxes, and breaks layout
[17:32:35] <Pr3fix> so I have an h3 tag with an id, and I want to change the contents of the h3 tag to that of a variable. What would be the most efficient way to do that?
[17:33:12] <shoky_> $('h3#theId').text( someVar )
[17:33:18] <shoky_> or .html( someVar )
[17:33:27] <Pr3fix> shoky: thanks! :D
[17:33:31] <raj> oh, just /msged shoky
[17:33:36] <shoky_> ohh
[17:33:51] <shoky_> i'm at my cousin's , house/dog-sitting for a week
[17:33:56] <shoky_> ;p
[17:34:04] <shoky_> so for now im shoky_ ;p
[17:34:07] <raj> nice
[17:34:14] <ArtificialEX> hey im trying to check if $var is null and assign it a default value if so, in the least amount of lines
[17:34:23] <raj> just saying 60 Minutes had a nice report on Tel Aviv
[17:34:48] <shoky_> you come live here? ;p
[17:34:51] <tw2113> if($var === null) { $var = 'foo'; }
[17:34:58] <Lyfesaver> hey guys, i am using the CustomScrollBar plugin inside the UI Accordion.... both scripts use the class "content" and i think it is causing conflicts. Is there another option other than complete editing one of the plugins to make it work?
[17:35:28] <mda_> Is it possible to use JQuery's tabs in JQM?  (rather than the toolbars)
[17:35:43] <raj> maybe I should try visiting first :)
[17:35:49] <shoky_> ;]
[17:36:10] <ArtificialEX> thanks tw2113
[17:36:14] <ArtificialEX> this doesnt seem to be working though
[17:36:14] <ArtificialEX> $messages = data['Profile']['CountUnreadConversations'];
[17:36:14] <ArtificialEX> 			if ($messages === null) { $message = '0' };
[17:36:31] <ArtificialEX> oops plural
[17:36:50] <Stephen_> ArtificialEX: $var = $var === null  ? defaultValue  : $var
[17:36:50] <tw2113> maybe if($messages.length <= 0 ) ?
[17:36:55] <shoky_> you sure you only want to check for null, specifically?
[17:37:21] <ArtificialEX> yeah just null i think
[17:37:33] <shoky_> cause usually that's handled like  $var = $var || '0'
[17:37:41] <ArtificialEX> hmm
[17:37:44] <Stephen_> ArtificialEX: What about undefined?
[17:37:45] <shoky_> but that would work also for undefined or 0 or false
[17:37:52] <Stephen_> Yeah, like shoky_ says
[17:38:03] <ArtificialEX> so $messages = data['Profile']['CountUnreadConversations'] || '0';
[17:38:19] <shoky_> works
[17:38:25] <Stephen_> ArtificialEX
[17:38:35] <shoky_> why the $ though
[17:38:40] <Stephen_> as long as data['Profile'] always exists, you're good
[17:38:59] <mda_> nevermind….i'll use the 5 tab bars and ship….ugh……..wish sliders could use characters in jqm
[17:39:05] <Lyfesaver> i am guessing my only way is to edit on plugin then
[17:39:15] <ArtificialEX> im not sure why do some jquery variables have $ ?
[17:39:37] <mda_> $ is shorthand for jquery
[17:39:43] <shoky_> if it's a jquery object then some use the convention
[17:39:45] <ArtificialEX> why does data['Profile'] always have to exist Stephen, wont $messages be '0' if not
[17:39:50] <shoky_> but '0' is hardly a jquery object
[17:39:58] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: It's a convention to differential a jquery object...
[17:40:03] <systemfault> *differentiate
[17:40:04] <ArtificialEX> but is $messages a jquery object...
[17:40:13] <shoky_> depends what you assign to it..
[17:40:16] <ArtificialEX> i mean javascript is jquery so i never understood why make a variable jquery specific
[17:40:30] <ArtificialEX> jquery can use a javascript variable just the same
[17:40:31] <shoky_> it's not jquery specific. $ is a valid character in javascript
[17:40:47] <shoky_> it's just a convention to differentiate...
[17:40:53] <shoky_> i don't use it myself
[17:41:01] <Stephen> ArtificialEX: $.variableName is just a popular way to make global variables without being in window scope
[17:41:15] <Stephen> $variableName is just another variable
[17:41:56] <ArtificialEX> ok. your right though data['Profile']['CountUnreadConversations'] has to exist, or else the || 0 part doesnt work
[17:41:59] <tw2113> $ in front of variables makes me think of php
[17:42:00] <ArtificialEX> why is that?
[17:42:13] <tw2113> ArtificialEX because both would return false
[17:42:22] <shoky_> that doesnt matter
[17:42:26] <tw2113> something like that
[17:42:34] * tw2113 goes back to post editing
[17:42:57] <shoky_> ArtificialEX: if data['Profile'] is undefined, then you should get an Error thrown
[17:43:17] <shoky_> because you're trying to reference the property 'CountUnreadConversations' in a non-existing object
[17:43:18] <Stephen> ArtificialEX: data['Profile']['CountUnreadConversations doesn't half to exist
[17:43:38] <krz> how does one accomplish something like: http://pastie.org/3942393
[17:44:00] <shoky_> huh
[17:44:33] <shoky_> one way to accomplish something like that by pasting some random code in a pastebin and post it here
[17:44:38] <shoky_> posting*
[17:44:44] <shoky_> is by*
[17:45:18] <derrida> I don't know where he problem is but I'm having a very hard time removing a border outline around the jqueryui accordion headers. There are several posts about this on the web but no matter what I try Chromium manages to render this orange focus boxes around the selected header. The problem is non-existent in firefox. Anyone run into this?
[17:45:26] <derrida> s/he/the/
[17:46:28] <shoky_> but uhh.. krz: html += '<a href="#" title="' + ( (data.activity.referer !== null) ? 'coming from '+data.activity.referer : '') + '">\n';
[17:46:57] <shoky_> but that's an awful approach to building some elements
[17:51:04] <aphid> derrida - have you tried deconstructing the border?
[17:51:09] <aphid> ...i couldn't resist
[17:51:45] <derrida> aphid: lol :P
[17:52:09] <derrida> well played
[17:53:04] <shoky_> lol :)
[18:08:16] <derrida> so, in chrome's debugger, i can see the rule that is causing this orange box: :focus { outline: #f1ca7f; } and it is getting pulled in from "user stylesheet", if i put a rule in my stylesheet to set this to outline: none, it still gets overridden. I *think* this is a jqueryui related rule because it's the same orange used to highlight the selected tab/accordion
[18:08:51] <derrida> i'm not using the jqueryui css theming
[18:09:39] <krz> how do i get all elements with "data-created-at" attributes ?
[18:10:33] <aphid> does $('[data-created-at]') work?
[18:11:06] <tw2113> wouldn't it be $('#foo').data('created-at'); ?
[18:11:37] <ArtificialEX> why is ajax so much clearly slower than php?
[18:11:48] <krz> aphid: thanks
[18:11:49] <ArtificialEX> for instance, when I use ajax i can noticeably see things pop into place
[18:11:55] <ArtificialEX> but with php, its just there on page load
[18:12:10] <tw2113> because with php it's all done server side
[18:12:16] <tw2113> and js is browser side
[18:12:39] <derrida> comparing ajax and php is weird :s
[18:13:01] <tw2113> all the processing work is already done, with js it has to process once it reaches that point
[18:21:47] <Milos|Netbook> So I have an ajax request, but the 'complete' callback is called immediatly on click (even though I know the submit should take 5 seconds to process) and there is statusText: "error" but the form still submits correctly.
[18:21:49] <Milos|Netbook> Why is that so?
[18:22:16] <Milos|Netbook> And when I say submit correctly, I mean it submits, but not with ajax, so I guess incorrectly.
[18:23:53] <tw2113> attack of the async ?
[18:24:17] <Milos|Netbook> Yes but, async means it will call 'complete' only when it finishes.
[18:24:24] <Milos|Netbook> Is that not right?
[18:26:42] <aphid> Milos|Netbook: are you maybe getting the complete on the click?
[18:26:46] <aphid> and not the ajax request
[18:29:32] <Milos> aphid, http://dpaste.com/750624/
[18:29:39] <Milos> aphid, does that look ok?
[18:30:00] <Milos> later down I have $('input:checkbox').click(function() {
[18:30:01] <Milos> 										$('form#grab').trigger('submit');
[18:30:47] <Mylesmadness> Is anyone here familiar with roundabout(http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)? I'm having a an issue where the stuff in the boxes doesnt scale with the boxes, and breaks layout
[18:33:50] <Vlad_> hi guys
[18:34:16] <Vlad_> im using jquery sortable to exchange data between two lists
[18:34:39] <Vlad_> i cant figure out how to fire an event when i drop something to the second list
[18:36:07] <shoky_> derrida: got a jsfiddle of the accordion?
[18:36:43] <Vlad_> its not accordion and the tables are very complex i cant seem to cut it down
[18:36:43] <Vlad_> $('ul#orderList li').bind('change', function(){ alert("works");});
[18:36:47] <Vlad_> this is what i ahve
[18:36:51] <Vlad_> it does not work
[18:36:53] <shoky_> o nm
[18:37:32] <Vlad_> do you have any suggestion
[18:39:43] <Vlad_> hm anyone?
[18:39:52] <Vlad_> im sure from so many ppl someone can help
[18:42:20] <Dr-Bombay> vlad: just a moment
[18:43:15] <Dr-Bombay> li does not generate change events
[18:43:26] <Vlad_> http://jsfiddle.net/9vjd5/
[18:43:29] <Vlad_> here is a fiddle
[18:43:38] <Vlad_> ok but how can i detect a change in the list?
[18:43:48] <Vlad_> when u move one item in the other list
[18:43:54] <Vlad_> i need to do some calculations
[18:44:01] <Dr-Bombay> well, any change will probably be caused by your own code
[18:44:41] <Dr-Bombay> so your script will already be running
[18:45:03] <Vlad_> yes but its drag and drop
[18:45:11] <Vlad_> i need to detect drop on one table
[18:45:20] <Vlad_> not drop any where on the screen
[18:45:32] <Dr-Bombay> then you probably have a drop handler
[18:45:35] <mda_> how can I make a link (anchor) on the same page get scrolled to when another that links to it is clicked?  I tried data-ajax="false"
[18:45:42] <Dr-Bombay> detect the change there
[18:45:47] <Vlad_> how
[18:45:52] <Vlad_> thats what i am looking for
[18:46:28] <shoky_> derrida: i once had a similar issue with the accordion. making these changes in the css helped (the image change i did for the icons color):  http://pastebin.com/rveeGsCU
[18:46:46] <shoky_> (that's what i added to modify the redmond theme to my liking)
[18:46:51] <Dr-Bombay> look, if you are inserting something into a list because of a drop, then you can detect the change because you are the one causing it
[18:47:22] <Vlad_> can u fix the fiddle i posted?
[18:47:37] <Vlad_> i can detect drop but not drop on my list
[18:48:00] * mda_ googles ajax mode and same page linking....
[18:51:07] <Vlad_> maybe .bind( "sortchange", function(event, ui) will do
[18:51:13] <Vlad_> i will experiment with it a little
[18:52:40] * Dr-Bombay shakes his head
[18:53:46] <mda_> maybe I need a DOM method...
[18:53:51] <Dr-Bombay> don't read the documentation, just make things up and type them
[18:54:16] <Vlad_> i went trough it once and missed it
[18:54:19] <Vlad_> it works now
[18:54:24] <Vlad_> btw the irc here
[18:54:29] <Vlad_> like 400ppl online
[18:54:33] <Vlad_> only 1 try to help
[18:54:58] <mda_> or troll on IRC
[18:56:05] <Vlad_> thanks any way
[18:57:20] <shoky_> you want 10 people helping you at once?
[18:58:40] <aphid> it's irc, 50% of them have been idle for more than a week and the other half are bots.
[18:59:13] <Vlad_> no but... in the chat history i only see ppl quit and join and nobody talks anything
[18:59:29] <mda_> on irc, if the person answering doesn't have a direct answer within 5 minutes, they are a troll
[18:59:33] <systemfault> Well...
[18:59:35] <shoky_> this channel is not meant to view join/quits in
[18:59:41] <shoky_> disable them showing
[18:59:48] <shoky_> i only see chat chat chat
[18:59:53] <Vlad_> how :S
[19:00:00] <shoky_> what irc client
[19:00:19] <Vlad_> google chrome addin
[19:00:28] <Vlad_> freenode irc
[19:00:38] <shoky_> webchat.freenode.net?
[19:00:48] <shoky_> you can disable it in the options
[19:02:17] <Vlad_> thank you very much for this
[19:02:35] <shoky_> enjoy the channel
[19:02:37] <Vlad_> itt was hard to read with all those things
[19:02:42] <shoky_> yea
[19:15:01] <mustefaj> Can someone please take a look at this pastebin for me and help out?
[19:15:02] <mustefaj> http://pastebin.com/YRkMp7x5
[19:15:30] <mustefaj> I'm looking for advice on syntax and the best way to loop through the object i'd like created, maybe as a json object looped using jquery?
[19:16:25] <systemfault> just a loop?
[19:16:36] <mustefaj> i guess so?
[19:16:45] <systemfault> Do you have a question?
[19:16:49] <mustefaj> i'm used to looping through something like that with python, though i'm a little bit lost here
[19:17:03] <mustefaj> ^^
[19:17:03] <mustefaj> I'm looking for advice on syntax and the best way to loop through the object i'd like created, maybe as a json object looped using jquery?
[19:17:39] <systemfault> It's just an array… just loop
[19:17:48] <tw2113> ?each
[19:17:49] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:18:05] <mustefaj> the function would be where i populate the form and all that right?
[19:18:23] <systemfault> mustefaj: Yeah
[19:18:45] <systemfault> mustefaj: You could simply use concatenation.. or use a templating engine.
[19:19:22] <mustefaj> i guess concatenation to start lightweight and transition into a templating engine later
[19:20:36] <mustefaj> thanks guys.
[19:26:52] <eeklund> Is there an easy way to force a rule set on a single :hidden field if ignore: is set to ":hidden"?
[19:27:30] <eeklund> An override to the default ignore rule?
[19:35:39] <mda_> …setting window.location doesn't help me scroll :(
[19:37:15] <derrida> shoky_: sorry, had to go afk, i'll make a jsfiddle
[19:37:52] <imsky> bah
[19:38:01] <imsky> customizing bootstrap is so tedious no wonder nobody does it
[19:39:48] <mustefaj> @imsky: its really tedious?
[19:40:01] <imsky> you bet your sweet buns it is
[19:40:05] <mustefaj> lol
[19:40:08] <mustefaj> i'm doing it now too
[19:40:15] <imsky> god damn..how do people do it?
[19:40:24] <imsky> i saw some decent looking bootstrap themes, that must have taken hours
[19:40:39] <mustefaj> i set up an entire project with the default theme
[19:40:40] <imsky> half the time i'm just doing grep searches to find variable references...
[19:40:53] <mustefaj> and then start modifying piecemeal
[19:41:11] <mustefaj> though i haven't touched the js, just css i mean
[19:41:22] <mustefaj> co-working just does it all with LESS
[19:41:23] <imsky> well the js isn't less-processed, thank god
[19:41:35] <owen1> do u guys organize your client-side code into small files and before deploying to production u compress it into 1 big js file?
[19:41:37] <mustefaj> yeah exactly
[19:41:49] <imsky> owen1, development is many files, production 1 minified
[19:42:01] <owen1> imsky: how technically do u achieve that?
[19:42:16] <imsky> there are some asset tools, i dunno for node/php, but for ruby there's jammit
[19:42:25] <mda_> troll solution: bribe way onto standards committee, appoint self as BDFL
[19:42:31] <owen1> currently in my index.html i am requiring form.js, order.js etc
[19:42:58] <imsky> lol it took me like 5 minutes to figure out there's no :hover color set for buttons. it's just a background-position trick
[19:43:09] <imsky> bootstrap is the devil jesus christ
[19:43:12] <owen1> imsky: ok. i'll look for a node solution for doing it. thanks
[19:43:17] <imsky> owen1, np bud
[19:43:33] <mustefaj> @bot-t how can i use jquery to select an array?
[19:43:45] <imsky> you better ask a human that one
[19:43:52] <mustefaj> oops
[19:44:03] <mustefaj> lol i thought some bot-t dude answered a question i had before
[19:44:10] <mustefaj> i'm taking a screenshot of that one
[19:44:11] <imsky> bot-t is a bot, so he can't really..talk
[19:44:20] <mustefaj> reddit, here we come
[19:44:24] <mda_> bot-t: Docs talk
[19:44:26] <bot-t> mda_, Talk:UI/Sortable - jQuery JavaScript Library - Documentation - jQuery - As [ this page ] has been erased, i took its content from Google cache http://docs.jquery.com/Talk:UI/Sortable
[19:44:35] <imsky> lol ^
[19:44:38] <mustefaj> lol
[19:44:39] <imsky> a grand failure
[19:44:54] <mustefaj> ooooh
[19:44:55] <mustefaj> ?each
[19:44:56] <imsky> oh god bootstrap
[19:44:56] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:44:58] <imsky> @dropdownBorder:                rgba(0,0,0,.2);
[19:45:00] <mustefaj> i see what happened
[19:45:03] <imsky> ^ why isn't this a mixin
[19:45:15] <imsky> this will break on some configuration of ie
[19:45:22] <imsky> never again
[19:45:23] <Vlad_> which is better to use $( ".selector" ).something or $( ".selector" ).bind(something
[19:45:28] <mustefaj> drop support for ie :p
[19:45:33] <imsky> vlad_ they're identical
[19:45:42] <Vlad_> on performance?
[19:45:47] <mda_> bot-t: Docs troll
[19:45:50] <bot-t> mda_, #10168 (jQuery.event.trigger and inline handlers.)  jQuery Core ... - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10168
[19:45:51] <imsky> mmm dunno about that, but they all go to .on
[19:45:58] <mustefaj> @imsky: do you know the answer to that q, selector for an erray?
[19:46:07] <imsky> mustefaj, yeah ask me the question
[19:46:12] <imsky> i'm just weeping for my time
[19:46:18] <mustefaj> lol
[19:46:43] <mustefaj> just hit pause on life bro
[19:46:52] <imsky> can't, i started like half an hour ago
[19:47:09] <imsky> anyway what's your question
[19:47:20] <mustefaj> lol, select an array with jquery?
[19:47:24] <mustefaj> array = blablabla
[19:47:27] <mustefaj> $(array) ?
[19:48:08] <imsky> why would you need that
[19:48:27] <mustefaj> look through an array to populate some forms
[19:48:44] <mustefaj> each item in the array has 3 err, items
[19:48:44] <imsky> errr you don't need jquery for that
[19:48:54] <imsky> unless there's something you have to do with jquery, like .each
[19:49:02] <mustefaj> that's what was recommend for me way ^^
[19:49:07] <mustefaj> to use .each
[19:49:08] <imsky> in which case, you don't use $([]), you use $.each([])
[19:49:12] <mustefaj> so now i'm trying to select the sonofa
[19:49:57] <mustefaj> so if my array was called cowboy: $.each([cowboy]) ?
[19:50:01] <mustefaj> and run a function?
[19:50:10] <imsky> no
[19:50:14] <imsky> $.each(cowbody, function(){})
[19:50:19] <imsky> cowbody? cowboy
[19:50:28] <mustefaj> cowboy!!!!
[19:50:39] <mustefaj> like garth brooks
[19:50:44] <imsky> yeah baby
[19:50:44] <mustefaj> or wyclef jean.
[19:50:47] <imsky> noooo
[19:50:48] <oojacoboo> what's a json_encode(d) array considered to $.type() ?
[19:50:54] <mustefaj> lol
[19:50:55] <imsky> ?tias
[19:50:56] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:51:01] <mustefaj> man i gotta idle here just to learn stuff
[19:51:18] <oojacoboo> imsky, you telling me to tias?
[19:51:21] <imsky> yeah baby
[19:51:25] <oojacoboo> bitch
[19:51:27] <mustefaj> lol
[19:51:28] <oojacoboo> I oughta
[19:51:28] <imsky> <3
[19:51:34] <imsky> hey i helped you test your app
[19:51:37] <imsky> don't be hatin
[19:51:45] <mda_> ?reem
[19:51:52] <oojacoboo> imsky, when was that?
[19:51:58] <oojacoboo> must have been a min
[19:51:59] <imsky> last year i think
[19:52:03] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:52:19] <mda_> bot-t: Docs reem
[19:52:21] <imsky> oh bootstrap you devil
[19:52:30] <imsky> you lure me in with easy and good looking defaults
[19:52:36] <oojacoboo> meh
[19:52:39] <oojacoboo> don't touch it
[19:52:43] <imsky> i won't from now on
[19:52:50] <imsky> i'm definitely disappointed with less
[19:52:50] <oojacoboo> I never would have
[19:52:55] <oojacoboo> LESS?
[19:52:57] <imsky> yeah
[19:53:03] <oojacoboo> SCSS ftw
[19:53:04] <mda_> bot-t is GONE?!
[19:53:11] <oojacoboo> although, I still use plain ole css
[19:53:12] <imsky> oojacoboo, it's not a toolkit-specific thing
[19:53:13] <aphid> he stared into the sun
[19:53:16] <mustefaj> SASS seems better
[19:53:22] <oojacoboo> SASS is NOT BETTER
[19:53:27] <imsky> it's the whole "recompile and have info spread out across files" problem
[19:53:32] <oojacoboo> SCSS supports css for one and it's the latest iteration
[19:53:41] <mustefaj> SCSS or SASS?
[19:53:42] <oojacoboo> imsky, exactly, that's why I don't use it
[19:53:51] <oojacoboo> but there is an app for your mac that will compile on the fly
[19:53:53] <imsky> oojacoboo, so you don't use scss? :D
[19:53:58] <Joan> I'm the sassmaster.
[19:53:58] <aphid> css crossing over from presentation to logic? do not want
[19:54:03] <mustefaj> @imsky: just compile it on the fly man
[19:54:04] <oojacoboo> it monitors your assets folder and waits for a changed file
[19:54:06] <imsky> aphid, too late to tell me
[19:54:08] <mustefaj> yeah
[19:54:11] <imsky> mustefaj, i do that already with phpless
[19:54:17] <mustefaj> ah ok, yeah
[19:54:24] <mustefaj> tbh, i don't mess with the less
[19:54:30] <imsky> it's the editing part, i wish we had source maps for .less
[19:54:37] <imsky> or at least it wouldn't strip out the goddamn comments
[19:54:42] <oojacoboo> ha
[19:54:53] <oojacoboo> imsky, that's why you use scripts to prep your assets
[19:54:59] <oojacoboo> gzip minify, etc
[19:55:01] <imsky> how does that help
[19:55:07] <imsky> with my problem
[19:55:09] <imsky> >:|
[19:55:11] <oojacoboo> it strips the comments out
[19:55:14] <oojacoboo> from prod code
[19:55:20] <imsky> dammit you're talking about something else
[19:55:26] <imsky> LESS strips out the comments
[19:55:31] <oojacoboo> oh
[19:55:31] <imsky> i need them to find my way back to source
[19:55:37] <oojacoboo> gotcha
[19:55:47] <imsky> yeah
[19:56:02] <oojacoboo> I might use it one day, but our css is basically complete for now
[19:56:02] <imsky> less is great if it's all one file
[19:56:11] <mda_> SAAS or SASS or SasS
[19:56:19] <imsky> i'm a sassy black woman
[19:56:35] <mda_> SAAS doesn't contain substring ASS
[19:56:44] <imsky> correct
[19:56:56] <imsky> i think 100% of the stuff you've said so far has been noise mda_
[19:57:02] <mda_> isn't SAAS a buzzword
[19:57:06] <imsky> no
[19:57:09] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:57:18] <oojacoboo> it is though
[19:57:23] <imsky> how's saas a buzzword?
[19:57:25] <runvnc> hello. anyone here use coffeescript
[19:57:26] <oojacoboo> SaaS = Software as a Service
[19:57:31] <imsky> runvnc, run for your life
[19:57:36] <imsky> fuck coffeescript in its ass
[19:57:37] <mda_> SAAS == modularization == "don't do stupid things"
[19:57:43] <runvnc> lol
[19:57:44] <imsky> oojacoboo, so i guess paas and iaas are just "buzz words" too
[19:57:49] <oojacoboo> sure
[19:57:53] <imsky> nah man
[19:57:57] <oojacoboo> acronymic buzzes
[19:57:58] <imsky> what's the non-buzzword version of paas?
[19:58:14] <oojacoboo> web hosting :P
[19:58:23] <imsky> not really, you know that
[19:58:32] <oojacoboo> but pretty much
[19:58:38] <imsky> heroku != some php host
[19:58:48] <imsky> big difference in workflow etc
[19:59:05] <oojacoboo> we're not gonna argue that b/c I agree with you
[19:59:09] <imsky> <3
[19:59:10] <mda_> social noise is a consequence of non-answers :-)
[19:59:14] <oojacoboo> just screwin your semantics
[19:59:18] <imsky> did you have a question mda_
[19:59:26] <runvnc> does anyone here.. not hate coffeescript
[19:59:28] <imsky> i'm just stalling myself from modifying bootstrap
[19:59:34] <imsky> runvnc, why would they not
[19:59:48] <oojacoboo> I don't see the point of coffeescript to be honest
[19:59:57] <oojacoboo> it doesn't look like it's going to save me a ton of time
[20:00:00] <imsky> hey check it out runvnc http://js2cs.nodejitsu.com/
[20:00:05] <mda_> how can I scroll to a list item on my page when another link to it is clicked? (ajax mode being considered)
[20:00:11] <imsky> now you can write js, convert it to cs, and then when you run it, it'll be back to js
[20:00:19] <imsky> a WIN WIN
[20:00:22] <runvnc> lol
[20:00:26] <oojacoboo> imsky, that's a nice troll site
[20:00:27] <runvnc> well js2coffee.org is better I think
[20:00:42] <imsky> you beat me at my own game sir
[20:00:47] <oojacoboo> wtf would you convert js to coffeecrap
[20:00:49] <imsky> ^
[20:00:59] <aphid> js2coffee2js2circlejerk
[20:01:00] <imsky> mda_, explain your question
[20:01:13] <oojacoboo> that's like… hey, please make my code less efficient, thanks
[20:01:45] <oojacoboo> although, it might be useful if you're trying to read some really old js crap that needs updating
[20:01:48] <mda_> imsky: I have a long UL LI list, and some links to sections in the header….when I click on them, I want the focus to be on the linked section
[20:02:16] <imsky> mda_, so just do blah.html#section
[20:02:26] <mda_> doesn't work
[20:02:34] <imsky> does your section div have id section?
[20:02:48] <mda_> maybe because of ajax mode, or maybe because i'm using JQM (YES, wrong channel, but they never talk)
[20:03:00] <imsky> dunno what ajax mode is, sounds bizzarre
[20:03:01] <mda_> imsky: I tried that
[20:03:11] <imsky> mda_, you can force it with .scrollTop
[20:03:15] <imsky> er .scrollTo
[20:03:26] * mda_ googles...
[20:03:33] <imsky> no it's scrollTop
[20:05:56] <mda_> I think it's something like scrollTo(0, $("div").scrollTop())
[20:06:12] <imsky> lol wat
[20:06:42] <aphid> yo dawg herd u liked scrolls
[20:07:18] <imsky> actually oojacoboo while you were on the topic, what do you use for asset management and build automation?
[20:07:35] <imsky> the enterprise world has a shit ton of options, but not web dev
[20:07:48] <oojacoboo> no CDN at all ATM, but a custom build automation using a php script for all the assets
[20:08:07] <oojacoboo> going to be moving to CDN when we jump on EC2
[20:08:21] <imsky> i meant more like stuff you run from staging to production
[20:08:38] <oojacoboo> oh, custom shell script with gitFlow workflow
[20:08:50] <oojacoboo> versioning and everything
[20:08:55] <imsky> word up
[20:09:00] <imsky> do you do any continuous integration?
[20:09:20] <oojacoboo> na, not yet, the deployment workflow is actually pretty snappy
[20:09:24] <oojacoboo> I just run…
[20:09:33] <oojacoboo> ./prepareRelease 2.3.1
[20:09:34] <imsky> i salute you little bugger
[20:09:47] <oojacoboo> then go to server and run ./release 2.3.1
[20:10:12] <imsky> hmm ok
[20:10:16] <imsky> how do you test?
[20:10:23] <oojacoboo> that's good enough for now, continuous integration is a decent idea, but you need to have another dev layer for that really
[20:10:33] <oojacoboo> a sanity check layer
[20:10:35] <oojacoboo> that's expensive
[20:10:46] <oojacoboo> no unit tests really :(
[20:10:50] <imsky> lol ^
[20:10:53] <oojacoboo> :((
[20:11:01] <imsky> i was with you at no CI, but no unit testing is scary
[20:11:09] <oojacoboo> I agree
[20:11:31] <oojacoboo> unfortunately, it's just not a high enough priority ATM
[20:11:44] <imsky> well thanks for the info
[20:11:48] <oojacoboo> you bet
[20:11:55] <imsky> i wonder if there's a hole to fill in the web dev world
[20:12:07] <oojacoboo> at what point?
[20:12:11] <imsky> what with all this testing/integration/automation hoopla
[20:12:21] <imsky> my current project is being cucumbered from the start
[20:12:24] <oojacoboo> the issue is everyone does it different
[20:12:29] <imsky> so some webkit zombie's gonna test the ui from day 1
[20:12:42] <imsky> i think that's the future
[20:12:44] <oojacoboo> mmm, webkit zombie?
[20:12:53] * oojacoboo is intrigued 
[20:12:55] <imsky> yeah cucumber runs some headless webkit i think
[20:13:00] <imsky> like phantom/zombie
[20:13:04] <oojacoboo> imsky, that's your business model bro
[20:13:10] <imsky> what is
[20:13:17] <oojacoboo> webkit zombie
[20:13:19] <imsky> lol
[20:13:26] <oojacoboo> fuck, I'd pay $100 a month for that
[20:13:33] <imsky> i'll just run it on a loop
[20:13:37] <imsky> webkit zombie, scouring the internet
[20:13:57] <oojacoboo> it'd be nice though, think of a web ui where you could give the login credentials
[20:14:06] <oojacoboo> then list the urls for the forms and the params to pass to test
[20:14:28] <oojacoboo> like, if you could automate a lot of that process for testing
[20:14:34] <imsky> yeah that could be a decent business
[20:14:46] <oojacoboo> only issue is that it doesn't cover your crons
[20:15:00] <imsky> though at the same time, if a customer is advanced enough to _need_ BDD, they're not gonna outsource it
[20:15:00] <oojacoboo> and ajax ui's would be tricky
[20:15:22] <oojacoboo> imsky, it's no that though, it's all about time
[20:15:24] <oojacoboo> and costs
[20:15:35] <imsky> i'm an enterprise nub, maybe it makes sense for them
[20:15:45] <oojacoboo> why do you think utest.com makes bank?
[20:15:52] <imsky> i didn't know that existed
[20:16:02] <oojacoboo> oh yea
[20:16:06] <oojacoboo> big business
[20:16:26] <imsky> man
[20:16:33] <imsky> there's too much shit out there
[20:16:36] <oojacoboo> ha
[20:16:38] <imsky> need to reel it back in
[20:16:50] <imsky> so what is utest
[20:16:57] <oojacoboo> TONS of testing suites
[20:16:59] <imsky> a bunch of pradeeps and patels clicking buttons?
[20:17:08] <oojacoboo> they even have minons that will test your app for you
[20:17:14] <oojacoboo> UI tests and all
[20:17:15] <imsky> well there's my pradeep
[20:17:19] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:17:24] <mustefaj> @imsky that's terrible
[20:17:25] <mustefaj> lol
[20:17:25] <oojacoboo> lmao
[20:17:45] <imsky> i speak da troof
[20:17:49] <mustefaj> lol
[20:17:55] <oojacoboo> that's certainly a piece of it
[20:18:00] <oojacoboo> they do load testing and more
[20:18:12] <imsky> so then...they must do web stuff too
[20:18:14] <oojacoboo> geo location testing
[20:18:18] <imsky> your business model has been shattered playa
[20:18:26] <oojacoboo> oh, they do
[20:18:31] <oojacoboo> but it's expensive
[20:18:43] <oojacoboo> and it's not "automated"
[20:18:47] <Whirl3d> if you return a promise on a deferred object and then delete the deferred object, or delete the target associated with the deferred object, or delete the context in which the deferred object was created, what happens to the promise?
[20:19:07] <oojacoboo> it goes away
[20:19:17] <imsky> hmm
[20:19:20] <oojacoboo> it'd be stored with the object, no?
[20:19:33] <imsky> a deferred promise
[20:19:36] <imsky> sounds like virginity
[20:19:37] <oojacoboo> promise is an object param
[20:20:08] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d, look under your DOM tree, you should see promise under the element
[20:20:10] <Whirl3d> I am not sure. That's what I am trying to figure out. I could potentially have a lot of unrsolved promises in a script that I am writing. I want to make sure I'm not just sucking up member
[20:20:36] <Whirl3d> memory
[20:20:48] <Whirl3d> wow, sry about the terrible typing this evening.
[20:20:58] <imsky> anything to take my mind off of goddamn bootstrap
[20:21:01] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d, you get what I said?
[20:21:48] <Whirl3d> oojacoboo, thanks for the input. I will check it out in just a minute.
[20:21:56] <mda_> aphid: lol re: scrolls…..
[20:22:13] * mda_ resists making fun of names….too easy
[20:22:27] <mustefaj> good site for javascript crash course?
[20:22:37] <imsky> #jquery
[20:22:40] <mda_> though i have done SDET before, and i do think it's silly
[20:22:45] <mustefaj> aka, i'm scared to ask how do i access intro[0]
[20:22:45] <mustefaj> Object
[20:22:45] <mustefaj> 	.	help: "help copy"
[20:22:45] <mustefaj> 	.	id: "1"
[20:22:45] <mustefaj> 	.	text: "first question"
[20:22:46] <mustefaj> 	.	__proto__: Object
[20:22:49] <imsky> unless you want to learn how to do fizzbuzz, mustefaj
[20:22:52] <mustefaj> any one of those
[20:22:52] <imsky> then CODECADEMY is the name
[20:22:56] <mustefaj> lol
[20:23:01] <imsky> mustefaj, wat
[20:23:09] <imsky> where's intro in there
[20:23:10] <mustefaj> i have intro array
[20:23:13] <imsky> k
[20:23:19] <mustefaj> i just did intro[0]
[20:23:22] <imsky> k
[20:23:25] <mustefaj> intro = [{text:"first question", id:"1", help:"help copy"}, {text:"second question", id:"2", help:"help copy"}]
[20:23:27] <mustefaj> i defined it like that
[20:23:30] <imsky> yep
[20:23:36] <mustefaj> so i want to fetch anything in there
[20:23:40] <imsky> you just did
[20:23:43] <imsky> you got an object back
[20:23:44] <Whirl3d> mustfefaj, create a fiddle.
[20:23:45] <mustefaj> i fetched the object
[20:23:48] <mustefaj> oooooh
[20:23:49] <imsky> yeap
[20:23:50] <mustefaj> jsfiddle
[20:23:53] <mustefaj> i will
[20:23:56] <mda_> SDET: get a bunch of people who don't know the code to annoy the people who do know the code and arm managers with false ammo
[20:24:18] <imsky> wat is SDET
[20:24:48] <imsky> sergeant dickhead's extra truffles?
[20:24:58] * mda_ takes a 30 minute troll break
[20:25:15] <imsky> trolling is an lifestyle
[20:25:36] <StevenCodes> I pop in here every like hour and it's always funny
[20:25:58] <imsky> you should participate
[20:27:16] <mustefaj> http://jsfiddle.net/YexxB/
[20:27:20] <mustefaj> my first fiddle
[20:27:23] <mustefaj> bang.
[20:27:27] <StevenCodes> could but
[20:27:30] <StevenCodes> not enough jquery projects
[20:27:33] <StevenCodes> aha
[20:27:38] <imsky> my life is jquery projects
[20:27:42] <imsky> soon to be backbone projects
[20:27:49] <mustefaj> why not spine
[20:27:54] <mustefaj> kiiiiiidding.
[20:27:58] <StevenCodes> share them with ya buddy steven :)
[20:28:03] <imsky> you know i thought about it, but backbone has a bigger comm...oh you kidder
[20:28:20] <imsky> so what's the problem again mustefaj
[20:28:25] <imsky> i see your stupid fiddle
[20:28:30] <mustefaj> and raise it?
[20:28:38] <imsky> nah just see it
[20:28:42] <mustefaj> snap.
[20:28:49] <imsky> actually
[20:28:53] <imsky> you'd be better off with ideone
[20:29:08] <mustefaj> hm
[20:29:39] <imsky> wait never mind, it doesn't log objects
[20:29:48] <imsky> come on ideone, put the v8 interpreter in already
[20:29:53] <mustefaj> how can i access anything int hat object?
[20:30:00] <imsky> you just did, stupid
[20:30:08] <mustefaj> i mean
[20:30:10] <mustefaj> the object in the object
[20:30:14] <imsky> ?js intro = [{text:"first question", id:"1", help:"help copy"}, {text:"second question", id:"2", help:"help copy"}]; intro[0]
[20:30:15] <mustefaj> inception
[20:30:19] <imsky> bot-t?
[20:30:23] <imsky> nnnoooooo
[20:30:27] <mustefaj> burn
[20:30:30] <imsky> anyway
[20:30:34] <imsky> intro[0].text
[20:30:37] <imsky> as an example
[20:30:38] <mustefaj> ffs
[20:30:43] <mustefaj> lol
[20:30:47] <mustefaj> well that's easy then
[20:30:52] <imsky> yeah no shit
[20:31:02] <mustefaj> i dunno why i didn't do that
[20:31:10] <imsky> because i wasn't around
[20:31:18] <mustefaj> true say.
[20:32:16] <imsky> come on, give me more easy ones
[20:32:23] <imsky> i don't want to go back to piece of shit .less files
[20:32:26] <mustefaj> http://jsfiddle.net/YexxB/
[20:32:31] <imsky> i had more fun setting up clojure on windows
[20:32:42] <imsky> yeah what about it ^
[20:32:48] <imsky> you already did that one
[20:33:02] <mustefaj> even though i tell it [0] it's returning two objects
[20:33:22] <imsky> no it's not
[20:33:25] <mustefaj> ah
[20:33:31] <mustefaj> cause its a loop mutha#$@#
[20:33:38] <imsky> how old are you man
[20:33:42] <mustefaj> brb. i gotta go hang my head in shame
[20:33:55] <mustefaj> imsky, you're making me go emo. i think its just late
[20:33:57] <mustefaj> i'm 28
[20:34:02] <imsky> oh man you're older than me
[20:34:06] <imsky> i would have guessed younger
[20:34:13] <mustefaj> cause of my street wize slang
[20:34:21] <imsky> that and your inability to work with javascript
[20:34:24] <mustefaj> lol
[20:34:27] <mustefaj> i'm a uxd man
[20:34:33] <imsky> little kids aren't smart enough to grasp comp sci
[20:34:35] <imsky> uxd?
[20:34:40] <mustefaj> user experience designer
[20:34:51] <imsky> aka you're a graphic designer but you also make stuff to click on
[20:34:56] <mustefaj> nah
[20:35:01] <mustefaj> i dont graphic design
[20:35:05] <imsky> so...wireframes?
[20:35:09] <mustefaj> hardly
[20:35:11] <mustefaj> wireframes are for suckas
[20:35:21] <mustefaj> i do interaction design sketches
[20:35:24] <imsky> :(
[20:35:35] <imsky> you know that shit didn't exist like 3 years ago, right?
[20:35:38] <oojacoboo> if($foo == array()) ><
[20:35:40] <mustefaj> translate client requirements into features and all that
[20:35:47] <mustefaj> i think it did
[20:35:51] <mustefaj> it just didn't have a name
[20:36:00] <imsky> oojacoboo, php is my war buddy, but i'd shoot it if there was a better alternative
[20:36:07] <imsky> mustefaj, well i salute you for your middleman job
[20:36:11] <mustefaj> hah
[20:36:12] <oojacoboo> imsky, I concur
[20:36:13] <mustefaj> you punk
[20:36:15] <imsky> i do the shit you do AND the development
[20:36:24] <mustefaj> i'm really good at what i do though
[20:36:34] <imsky> no doubt, humans specialize like no other
[20:36:40] <mustefaj> i used to do python dev and all that junk
[20:36:43] <mustefaj> though as you can see
[20:36:43] <mustefaj> ...
[20:36:48] <mustefaj> i left that alone a while ago
[20:36:48] <imsky> js > python all day
[20:36:53] <mustefaj> yeah i like it
[20:36:58] <mustefaj> i just started yesterday
[20:37:13] <imsky> well you met me, that's like 33% of the way to being a js master
[20:37:15] <mustefaj> it's pretty annoying dev's dont appreciate ux guys
[20:37:49] <mustefaj> don't you hate doing both jobs?  or hopefully you get paid to do both
[20:38:04] <imsky> not really, i'm more in control of the whole process
[20:38:22] <mustefaj> you mean at work like on a team or at home
[20:38:22] <imsky> so there's fewer middlemen who don't understand what's not feasible or efficient
[20:38:28] <mustefaj> ah
[20:38:28] <imsky> at work
[20:38:33] <mustefaj> that's why i'm awesome
[20:38:41] <mustefaj> i get the whole feasable efficient junk
[20:38:48] <mustefaj> pardom me, mastery.
[20:39:14] <mustefaj> it's a good balance going from dev to strict ux
[20:39:44] <mustefaj> though in order to have street cred with any developers, i gotta start coding again
[20:39:52] <imsky> eh don't bother
[20:39:59] <imsky> stick with your middleman job
[20:40:10] <mustefaj> and hand it off to keyboard bangers?
[20:40:12] <imsky> once you get past arrays and objects, it's a rabbithole that never ends
[20:40:18] * imsky weeps for humanity
[20:40:22] <imsky> also goddamn i hate bootstrap
[20:40:22] <mustefaj> lol
[20:40:25] <vl1234> gud morning frns
[20:40:28] <imsky> hello jerk
[20:41:12] <vl1234> invoking json file is not workin in chrome but its workin in firefox ans IE may i know the issues
[20:41:42] <imsky> well that's all the help you'll get from me
[20:42:33] <mustefaj> @rage
[20:44:25] <mustefaj> @imsky do you really think that though, shouldn't get heavy into programming
[20:45:07] <imsky> put it this way, do you want to be known as a professional programmer?
[20:45:23] <mustefaj> no, never
[20:45:30] <imsky> well...then don't bother
[20:45:37] <mustefaj> well put.
[20:45:53] * imsky does a little dance
[20:46:29] <mustefaj> lol, it is a good answer.  thanks for your help imsky, i'ma keep hacking and trolling you for your cloak and dagger jabs.
[20:46:48] <imsky> no problem playa
[20:46:57] <imsky> i didn't get into programming because i wanted to, but here i am
[20:47:04] <imsky> like i said, it never ends
[20:47:07] <aphid> dabney coleman was bomb in cloak and dagger.  well, or he was when I was 8.
[20:47:16] <imsky> dabney coleman is a strong name
[20:47:22] <imsky> i'll name my son dabney coleman
[20:47:28] <imsky> then <middle name> <last name>
[20:47:30] <imsky> obviously
[20:47:38] <aphid> dabney coleman grill <last name>
[20:47:43] <imsky> why the grill?
[20:47:57] <aphid> http://www.coleman.com/products/27110
[20:48:05] <oojacoboo> apparently json_encode(d) is an array
[20:48:05] <imsky> i know _that_
[20:48:07] <oojacoboo> in js
[20:48:13] <imsky> lol wat
[20:48:18] <imsky> what's d?
[20:48:21] <aphid> middle names are worth $$$$.  endorsement deal
[20:48:29] <oojacoboo> past tense of the method ;)
[20:48:39] <imsky> you make no sense
[20:48:44] <imsky> json_encode is php fuckery
[20:48:48] <oojacoboo> json_encode() is a mehtod
[20:48:57] <imsky> in what library
[20:49:04] <oojacoboo> json_encoded is an array that has been ran with json_encode
[20:49:06] <oojacoboo> php bro
[20:49:11] <imsky> ghhh
[20:49:17] <Vlad_> how can i get the text thats is in <h2> with $(this).text()
[20:49:18] <imsky> i know it is that's what i said
[20:49:21] <imsky> >:|
[20:49:29] <imsky> $("h2").text() Vlad_
[20:49:38] <imsky> get ALL the texts
[20:49:43] <mustefaj> what templating should i use?
[20:49:45] <oojacoboo> yea, well, when you pass that to js, it's type is an array()
[20:49:50] <imsky> mustefaj, hogan.js
[20:49:52] <mustefaj> to loop that array into a form
[20:49:53] <oojacoboo> which is what I needed to validate as the response
[20:49:57] <mustefaj> cool thanks
[20:50:02] <imsky> oojacoboo, man probably i dunno whatever
[20:50:07] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:50:19] <Vlad_> $("h2").text() will act as $(this)?
[20:50:33] <Vlad_> if not how can i perform it on $(this)
[20:50:39] <imsky> what
[20:50:49] <imsky> man i should charge for help
[20:50:54] <oojacoboo> $(this) all the things

[20:54:37] <Vlad_> guys so the answer is?
[20:54:40] <Vlad_> for something like $(this).('h2').text() ?
[20:54:44] <tw2113> i swear there's a harry potter joke somewher with "this" and draco
[20:54:52] <oojacoboo> Vlad_, that's so wrong I wouldn't know where to start
[20:54:58] <Vlad_> i know
[20:55:00] <imsky> Vlad_ i gues you're not russian. $(this).find("h2").text()
[20:55:07] <Vlad_> but.. i want to get something like that
[20:55:17] <Vlad_> yes baby thanks
[20:55:23] <imsky> aww ye
[20:55:51] <Vlad_> im gonna love u so hard now
[20:55:52] <Vlad_> it works
[20:56:04] <imsky> you are victorious
[20:56:23] <imsky> oojacoboo, did you ever consider rewriting in !php?
[20:56:45] <imsky> i'm so torn between going with ruby (oh god no) or java/node from php
[20:56:52] <imsky> and with just staying
[20:57:32] <oojacoboo> rewriting what?
[20:57:38] <imsky> any part of your app
[20:57:46] <oojacoboo> it's all php
[20:57:53] <imsky> yes, go on
[20:58:06] <oojacoboo> go on on?
[20:58:16] <imsky> dammit, my question was did you consider rewriting any of it
[20:58:30] <imsky> as in "python would do that better" etc
[20:58:52] <oojacoboo> na, don't want to manage two backend code bases
[20:58:55] <oojacoboo> that's a nightmare
[20:59:10] <oojacoboo> webserver issues, etc
[20:59:12] <imsky> would you keep using php for your next project?
[20:59:38] <oojacoboo> I certainly would unless I partnered with someone that was better than me and insisted on something else
[20:59:50] <oojacoboo> but I quite like php
[20:59:52] <imsky> that's all the research i need
[21:00:55] <oojacoboo> imsky, you doing a new proj?
[21:01:12] <imsky> i'm thinking of making a new, large-scale site
[21:01:23] <imsky> on the one hand, i know php, but not "enterprise-level"
[21:01:26] <oojacoboo> imsky, check out symfony2 then
[21:01:33] <imsky> on the other, ruby/python etc have big modern communities
[21:01:34] <oojacoboo> you'll thank me later
[21:01:37] <imsky> i did
[21:01:44] <imsky> i've checked pretty much every php framework out there
[21:01:55] <oojacoboo> nice, symfony2 is pretty awesome
[21:02:03] <oojacoboo> most of the components are used through other frameworks
[21:02:07] <imsky> i use twig, but i'll probably swap it for smarty later
[21:02:13] <oojacoboo> :/
[21:02:19] <imsky> anyway, benchmarks always show symfony to be a little slow
[21:02:35] <oojacoboo> it's not really built for speed speed
[21:02:45] <oojacoboo> it's built for large scale apps
[21:02:55] <imsky> mang i'm not made of money
[21:02:57] <Whirl3d> I'm just drawing a blank here. What are some of the reasons that I could lose access to "click" on anchor elements. I click a thumbnail and it shows it's content , but disables all the thumbs. Anything I should check first?
[21:03:04] <imsky> i can't afford to shell out for a better server just for this app
[21:03:04] <oojacoboo> ha, use silex then, if you want speed
[21:03:15] <imsky> silex is part of symfony
[21:03:19] <oojacoboo> but if I was planning on big, I'd build it out on something that can support it
[21:03:20] <imsky> or...a reconfiguration of it
[21:03:38] <oojacoboo> it's a stripped down underpinnings micro framework of it
[21:03:41] <imsky> hmm..so is that it? CI or Symfony?
[21:03:46] <imsky> or zend i guess
[21:03:50] <oojacoboo> Zend
[21:03:54] <oojacoboo> Cake if you're retarded
[21:04:00] <imsky> nah cake's slow too
[21:04:11] <oojacoboo> there are some others as well
[21:04:13] <imsky> zend seems good, but it's huge...i kinda don't want to spend months relearning everything
[21:04:24] <oojacoboo> Zend is more of a series of libs
[21:04:25] <imsky> codeigniter's site is retarded
[21:04:30] <imsky> yeah i know, it's decoupled
[21:04:35] <oojacoboo> CI isn't really made for large scale sites
[21:04:42] <oojacoboo> I think it's nice for custom sites
[21:04:45] <krz> RAILS!
[21:04:48] <krz> NODE JS
[21:04:52] <krz> DJANGO
[21:04:57] <oojacoboo> node is certainly not something to use in prod
[21:05:00] <krz> are we missing the point?
[21:05:02] <imsky> Whirl3d, there might be some .unbind somewhere
[21:05:08] <krz> oojacoboo: you are wrong
[21:05:11] <imsky> oojacoboo, orly? linkedin uses it no prob
[21:05:15] <Whirl3d> nah. no unbinds
[21:05:18] <oojacoboo> krz, you can play with it on your toy
[21:05:26] <Whirl3d> It's like there's something on top of them
[21:05:27] <imsky> Whirl3d, did you check .data("events")
[21:05:29] <oojacoboo> I wouldn't touch it for anything that's not streaming required
[21:05:47] <imsky> oojacoboo, so you're really fond of symfony eh
[21:05:54] <krz> yea depends on the requirements. but for traditional web apps. go rails or django. why php?
[21:06:00] <krz> save yourself the headache
[21:06:13] <imsky> because php is ridiculously spread out
[21:06:16] <imsky> it's got everything
[21:06:20] <krz> imsky: so does rails
[21:06:21] <oojacoboo> imsky, I am, the components of it that are put out are top notch, check out the new dependency system like ruby gems
[21:06:24] <krz> so is*
[21:06:35] <oojacoboo> the autoloader is top notch PSR0 compat
[21:06:42] <imsky> well i work on a rails project, it seems a lot of the time is spent just doing build automation crap
[21:06:45] <imsky> like bundle and rake
[21:06:49] <krz> and ruby is an amazing language
[21:06:51] <oojacoboo> twig is solid from evertything I've seen, although haven't used
[21:07:09] <krz> imsky: your obviously doing something wrong
[21:07:11] <imsky> oojacoboo, twig is slower than smarty, and smarty has less complicated syntax
[21:07:20] <oojacoboo> imsky, I don't use either
[21:07:21] <imsky> krz, lol ok, i'll just blame the team that actually does the ruby shit then
[21:07:22] <krz> imsky: sf does automation too you know
[21:07:36] <krz> doesn't mean it needs to be "automated"
[21:07:52] <Whirl3d> console log($(".thumb").first().data("events")) says undefined...
[21:07:55] <oojacoboo> you also have your ORM choices with sf
[21:08:00] <imsky> not the point, from what i see, rails == activerecord. if you don't <3 activerecord, better get ready to write tons of custom sql
[21:08:05] <imsky> Whirl3d, there's your prblem
[21:08:09] <krz> ive moved from PHP CI and SF. and now on rails. I'm a happier dev today
[21:08:19] <oojacoboo> krz, that's cool man
[21:08:21] <krz> oojacoboo: blah doctrine? really?
[21:08:23] <oojacoboo> sf1 or 2?
[21:08:27] <krz> sf 1.2
[21:08:28] <Whirl3d> whether it's bound or not
[21:08:33] <oojacoboo> krz, that's part of your prob
[21:08:40] <krz> oojacoboo: i don't have a problem
[21:08:40] <oojacoboo> sf2 is hawt
[21:08:47] <krz> php is a problem
[21:08:51] <oojacoboo> ha
[21:09:03] <oojacoboo> I have no issues with ruby, but here we go...
[21:09:09] <oojacoboo> rubyfag on the loose
[21:09:22] <krz> study a bit of ruby and possibly rails. youll love it from scratch
[21:09:45] <mda_> elm.scrollTop() returns null……I grabbed the right id string (passed in an attribute), but not sure it's then selecting the right element….
[21:09:54] <oojacoboo> krz, maybe one day
[21:10:03] <krz> start now, and save yourself
[21:10:05] <oojacoboo> I have a massive app on sf 1.4 ATM
[21:10:10] <mda_>       var jmp = String($(this).attr('myhref'));
[21:10:10] <mda_>       var elm = $(jmp);
[21:10:10] <mda_>       var stp = elm.scrollTop();
[21:10:34] <Whirl3d> mda_, wtf. Put it in a fiddle
[21:10:39] <krz> sf is config driven. its mad
[21:11:12] <mda_> Whirl3d: it was only 3 lines of code
[21:11:22] <imsky> oojacoboo, how does symfony scale?
[21:11:38] <krz> you mean php
[21:11:45] <imsky> no i mean symfony
[21:11:49] <imsky> raw php scales like a beast
[21:11:52] <mda_> alert(jmp); tells me I have the right hash anchor
[21:12:09] <oojacoboo> symfony scales quite well, at least from our case, we're still on one large server for prod though
[21:12:25] <oojacoboo> so, across multiple instances, I can't say yet
[21:12:37] <imsky> all right well i'll check it out again
[21:12:38] <oojacoboo> database abstraction is nice
[21:12:40] <Whirl3d> so, imsky, I can manually trigger the click event from console, so it's bound
[21:12:43] <oojacoboo> that takes out a big piece
[21:12:54] <imsky> Whirl3d, screen share me baby
[21:12:58] <imsky> i can't help you blind
[21:13:14] <imsky> https://join.me/
[21:13:17] <mda_> imsky: what you see may blind you
[21:13:23] <imsky> yeah the goat porn
[21:13:25] <imsky> i'm ready
[21:13:40] <Whirl3d> I have lots of good goat porn, what are you talking about?
[21:14:15] <imsky> anyway Whirl3d i'm serious, screen share with me, this sounds too tough to do through text
[21:16:11] <imsky> how do i respond lol
[21:16:43] <mda_> hey a poor man died in Enumclaw, WA trying that stuff…don't joke about it
[21:18:06] <Lucky--> If I have a page that is on a ssl hosted site, how do I avoid cross-domain JSON/JSONP calls from being blocked due to "security"?
[21:20:18] <mda_> HAH, a plugin! http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[21:31:34] <mda_> stale plugin…..i think i'm running into a JQM problem…it probably can't find the id because it's off screen…..
[21:34:14] <Vlad_> shouldnt it exist if the element is already drawn? no matter its off screen
[21:34:42] <mda_> i think it's a jquery mobile "issue"……
[21:35:18] <mda_> all I know 100% is, I have the right anchor hash, and the selector tells me the scrollTop is null
[21:36:18] <thinkerbell> is there a new version of jquery ui coming out soon, and when will the plugins site be ready?
[21:38:12] <Vlad_> try move the element on the screen and see if it works
[21:38:15] <Vlad_> u will know for sure
[21:38:34] <mda_> Vlad_: how?
[21:39:17] <Vlad_> how u set the element position?
[21:39:25] <Vlad_> cant u just move it with a code?
[21:39:50] <mda_> the element is static html
[21:40:21] <Vlad_> and how its created>
[21:40:22] <mda_> (though JQ transforms things some of course, like the hrefs of things for example)
[21:40:40] <Vlad_> argh
[21:40:44] <Vlad_> thats another thing
[21:40:52] <mda_> the id should not change though
[21:41:11] <Vlad_> u know what? try to change the id with a code
[21:41:23] <Vlad_> see if it can get catch it
[21:41:54] <Carlitta87> hey..does anyone know jquery flip...have any of u used it before?
[21:43:51] <mda_> Vlad_: I don't think setting it is a good idea, but I'll try similar things...
[21:44:19] <Vlad_> just to check if u can hook to it
[21:44:57] <mda_> Vlad_: I will try to set another attribute, like it's style
[21:46:03] <Vlad_> yes thats also fine
[21:54:02] <mda_> Vlad_: $("#somehash").attr({value:"____", text:"____"}); does nothing
[21:54:27] <mda_> whether or not I put the keys in quotes there
[21:54:34] <Carlitta87> is there a way for jquery flip to stop the process of not flipping as soon as "mouseleave"
[21:57:23] <mda_> maybe JQ/JQM is changing the id……..I tried connecting to localhost:9999 but can't
[22:02:32] <oojacoboo> bawse status
[22:03:03] <oojacoboo> got this sick ajax file uploader that uploads the file and pulls back the mime type and pulls a custom icon for it :)
[22:04:01] <mda_> Vlad_: I give up for a while….this is just broken….I don't know how the hell a hardcoded id can't be found
[22:05:30] <vl1234> hihi ......i facing this problem...cany any 1 help me....the error message from chrome <processExtendPage> currentPageType: , lastPageType:   am searched but am not get any of the solution
[22:12:21] <Vlad_> <mda_> try with some div off screen
[22:12:30] <Vlad_> and try to change its id as i said
[22:12:47] <Vlad_> or try to change the id directly on the thing u were working on
[22:13:34] <thomedy> is anyone up jsfiddling
[22:16:57] <Vlad_> or if u have jf fiddle maybe i can also play around with your thing a little
[22:18:12] <Vlad_> I ment the thing..... u r working on
[22:20:37] <styol> hrm it might just be me, but the jQuery UI downloads don't appear to be working properly. Starts downloading but seems to crap out around 66kb
[22:21:20] <thomedy> so i am trying to remove all elements inside my body but .class
[22:21:36] <thomedy> i have tried ('body > :not(.class)_
[22:21:56] <thomedy> and ihave done ('body').not(.class).remove
[22:21:59] <thomedy> but its not working
[22:24:32] <Vlad_> simple solution will be to add addClass(val); after the remove
[22:25:24] <thomedy> simple will work for me... but shouldn't have both of those work in my googling that swhat i found
[22:25:39] <thomedy> actually i forgot simple wont work)
[22:25:51] <thomedy> i have a specific design in mind which requires the order i choose...
[22:26:15] <Vlad_> u can still use addClass(val); at the end
[22:26:28] <Vlad_> u remove all then u bind again the ones u need
[22:26:42] <thomedy> okay let me give contex and it might help
[22:26:58] <thomedy> i have a event.preventDefault on my menu
[22:27:12] <thomedy> then i click an anchor append a div that has a counter in it
[22:27:17] <thomedy> so it willl never be the same
[22:27:37] <thomedy> then i load that div with this.attr('href')
[22:27:39] <thomedy> it works well
[22:27:51] <thomedy> then after i append
[22:28:04] <thomedy> which i will either float left or right or clear both
[22:28:27] <thomedy> then i animate to the new div to create a always next to but slideed next page kind of effect
[22:28:53] <thomedy> i cant .remove till the new page is the only visible space on the window
[22:30:12] <Vlad_> and?
[22:30:48] <Vlad_> what u want to do
[22:32:31] <Vlad_> u mean u want to remove excpet one class so the element doesnt change before u append the new class?
[22:36:24] <imsky> BAM!
[22:36:35] <imsky> i got knocked out by a thunderstorm but i'm back baby
[22:37:17] <Vlad_> $('p').removeClass('myClass noClass').addClass('yourClass'); u can check this also
[22:37:23] <Vlad_> im out
[22:37:30] <Vlad_> someone knocked me
[22:37:52] <imsky> THAST ME
[22:37:54] <imsky> i think
[22:38:02] <abjorn> imsky my bro
[22:38:05] <Vlad_> its me Mario!
[22:38:09] <imsky> abjorn, baby
[22:38:12] <imsky> how it goes
[22:38:17] <abjorn> tired
[22:38:21] <imsky> i officially hate bootstrap
[22:38:24] <abjorn> lol
[22:38:26] <abjorn> didnt take long
[22:38:27] <imsky> modifying it for a client
[22:38:31] <imsky> what a piece of shit
[22:38:42] <imsky> i'm greping through the whole thing to find how to change button colors
[22:38:50] <abjorn> loooll
[22:41:58] <mda_> Vlad_: It's a JQM loading issue…I added this to the actual list divider, and when clicked, it magically now has an offset: onclick="alert($(this).offset().top);"
[22:43:12] <thomedy> sorry i was temporarily detained
[22:43:37] <thomedy> to your question earlier vlad...  no that is not what i want..
[22:43:51] <thomedy> i want to append the div... .load() the div
[22:44:11] <thomedy> then remove everything in the body but that div as that div now holds almost entirely the same thing
[22:44:21] <thomedy> with new context however
[22:46:14] <mda_> Vlad_: even if I had the offset, I don't see a way to scroll to it…….re: your comments…if I split into more divs, I still don't think the objects will be loaded due to JQM
[22:58:06] <mda_> FTWidget……I give up…I've trying dojo mobile….this is just rediculous…I don't have time to go into the jquery internals and fix things that should just work……..end of rant
[22:58:18] <mda_> I've -> I'm  :)
[22:58:47] * mda_ watches Titanic sink
[23:03:31] <greedo> ok, I've selected a div appended to it, how can I close it if it is selected?
[23:14:47] <anli_> Its so strange, on one page and no other page I cannot use cookies to restore selected tab in a jquery tabs panel
[23:14:57] <anli_> So I get back to tab 1
[23:17:10] <anli_> I found the error, calling .tabs on two places
