[00:10:47] <DarsVaeda> I try to create my own function but get "this.map(...).filter" is not a funtion" -> http://pastebin.com/mtn317Dd
[00:12:53] <jallardice_> DarsVaeda: Your map method returns an object. Objects don't have a `filter` method. Also, note that you're overriding the built-in jQuery `map` method.
[00:13:17] <DarsVaeda> maybe I should use another name then ^^
[00:13:59] <jallardice_> DarsVaeda: Yeah I think that would be a good idea :) it should fix the error you mentioned.
[00:14:22] <DarsVaeda> is there a "mapInput"? ^^
[00:14:38] <jallardice_> DarsVaeda: No there isn't

[00:57:07] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone knows a jquery function to update a mysql entry?
[01:04:30] <Cork> abailarri: that isn't possible by definition
[01:05:10] <Cork> abailarri: mysql is a database server, and you don't want you mysql server accessible to random internet traffic
[01:05:29] <Cork> abailarri: so no client websites can't fiddle with your database servers
[01:06:00] <abailarri> Cork: but using ajax is possible to mody values no?
[01:06:29] <Cork> abailarri: no ajax is possible to contact your web server
[01:06:39] <MrBaz> abailarri, Yep, but the question appeared to want direct contact with server
[01:06:48] <MrBaz> which is not
[01:06:53] <MrBaz> as cork says
[01:06:54] <Cork> abailarri: and you should not just expose sql to ajax
[01:07:00] <Cork> that would be REALLY insecure
[01:07:31] * Cork sends DROP DATABASE through the ajax connection
[01:07:58] <abailarri> Cork: and what alternative are to have a button that changes database value on click?
[01:08:16] <Cork> abailarri: the option is to have commands you can send to the webserver
[01:08:27] <Cork> and have the web server do defined things on the database
[01:08:46] <Cork> like delete.php?=id will remove that id from a specific table
[01:08:47] <hexacode> is there a way without having to use each   to perform an action on an entire set? for example , if i used a selector to select all li's in a ul, can i make an operation on each element via chaining? without worrying about eaching through?
[01:08:49] <Cork> for example
[01:09:11] <abailarri> ok Cork
[01:09:13] <abailarri> thanks
[01:09:31] <Cork> hexacode: as long as the command can be done on all of the elements it works without each
[01:09:36] <Cork> ex $('li').addClass()
[01:09:43] <hexacode> thanks
[01:09:59] <Cork> hexacode: generically all the commands that return a value does not allow this for example
[01:10:25] <Cork> like .val() or .css('prop') or .attr('prop')
[01:11:07] <MrBaz> Do you know any reason why a $.POST with valid json returning (return type set to json) would not go into the success funtion even though the json passes jsonlint test ?
[01:11:44] <Cork> MrBaz: check the error/fail callback
[01:12:07] <Cork> also it's $.post not $.POST :)
[01:12:20] <MrBaz> habbbit lol
[01:12:37] <slax0r> wow...where do people get ideas like those is beyond me... -.-
[01:12:40] <Cork> there is no need to ever use the upercase for post; except in php
[01:12:43] <MrBaz> It works, wrote exstention method, so never have to write it lol
[01:13:02] <MrBaz> not caps work lol
[01:13:03] <Cork> slax0r: what idea? the sql one?
[01:13:09] <slax0r> yeah
[01:13:18] <abailarri> Cork: this is my proposit. I have a div that whan I click it, launch a jquery countdown. I want to when the countdowns finish, change some value form the databse
[01:13:26] <Cork> well it falls quite close to ppl wanting to call php functions from js
[01:13:51] <MrBaz> You can in asp, web methods.
[01:13:55] <Cork> abailarri: so have it call a script on the server
[01:14:03] <Cork> MrBaz: not really
[01:14:11] <Cork> the language makes it look like it
[01:14:16] <slax0r> yup
[01:14:33] <slax0r> you can't call a server method from the client just like that...you have to make a request to the web server
[01:14:40] <Cork> and in the backgrounds does something completely different
[01:14:46] <MrBaz> well yeah
[01:15:12] <MrBaz> I guess its not directly calling it in a native sence
[01:15:28] <Cork> MrBaz: it wrapps it in ajax calls
[01:15:31] <slax0r> you could also code a php function that would print out the necesary javascript etc that would contact the web server to call that specific method
[01:15:34] <abailarri> Cork: for example   $.ajax({ url: 'script.php' });
[01:15:41] <Cork> so when you call the function it makes an ajax call
[01:15:46] <Cork> abailarri: yes
[01:15:48] <abailarri> ok
[01:15:52] <abailarri> thanks
[01:15:59] <Cork> abailarri: you would have to keep track of the user somehow
[01:16:33] <abailarri> in this case I not need
[01:16:54] <MrBaz> Yeah, I know. Guess its bad to say that you have access to it as new people to it wont realise that ASP writes the calls for you
[01:16:58] <Cork> abailarri: then make sure search engines don't find the url
[01:17:22] <abailarri> is for a personal localhost app
[01:17:31] <Cork> MrBaz: i hate languages the hides what it does to this level
[01:17:49] <Cork> it alienates the developer from what happens
[01:17:52] <Cork> and that's never good
[01:18:22] <MrBaz> Yeah I agree, I also hate all the js asp writes for link buttons and __doPostback
[01:18:43] <MrBaz> another of asp's not as it seems to be
[01:18:46] <Cork> i'm not a fan of how asp.net does most anything
[01:18:53] <Cork> it's just slightly better then java
[01:19:01] <MrBaz> and more structured then pgp
[01:19:03] <MrBaz> php *
[01:19:29] <Cork> well you can make php just as structured, as long as you actually care about it
[01:19:35] <Cork> problem is most ppl don't
[01:21:28] <MrBaz> php is used very much as a quick and dirty way to make something. Some people do care, but it hasn't matured enough to have that structure there from the start. But I suppose that's where frameworks come in.
[01:22:04] <MrBaz> well, I say very much, that's my take. Obviously I haven't done a survey.
[01:22:13] <Cork> MrBaz: it has actually
[01:22:31] <Cork> it's just that many choose to use the old functions kept for compatibility
[01:23:18] <MrBaz> havent they forced out use of mysql_connect for pdo, the object way of doing it ?
[01:23:59] <Cork> sure, but there is a lot of other structures where there are much cleaner interfaces
[01:24:20] <MrBaz> Such as ? (haven't looked in depth at php in a while
[01:24:22] <MrBaz> )*
[01:24:38] <b0nn> hm, I have a string returned inside some html, and I use jQuery's .html(msg) to display the data on my webpage. What's the best way to display an image inside that data? a) return a link to the image in the html? b) return a name in the data, fish it out and get the image using jQuery c) use css or other solution?
[01:24:38] <Cork> i don't remember it right now
[01:24:46] <Cork> i don't use php that much anymore
[01:24:56] <MrBaz> fair enough
[01:25:14] <Cork> MrBaz: but php has full class support, in par with what you find in c++
[01:25:30] <Cork> so it is just based on you how well you want to structure things
[01:25:43] <MrBaz> cork: yeah, I did my dissertation in oop php
[01:26:24] <Cork> b0nn: depends on what you want to do with it
[01:26:42] <Cork> b0nn: if you want to have an image tag in the text, then ya definitely
[01:26:54] <Cork> b0nn: <img src="target"> in the html is the correct way
[01:27:36] <jop008> why is my general tab displayed strange? http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/17/
[01:28:14] <b0nn> ok, ta
[01:28:43] <Cork> jop008: http://fiddle.jshell.net/7zxm9/17/show/
[01:28:51] <Cork> not sure that matters but anyway
[01:29:42] <jop008> what are you trying to say?
[01:30:04] <Cork> jop008: start by fixing the broken html and see if that changes anything
[01:30:21] <Cork> opps i gave you the wrong link >_<
[01:30:23] <Cork> sorry about that
[01:30:28] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffiddle.jshell.net%2F7zxm9%2F17%2Fshow%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:30:44] <jop008> why do you think the html is not okay?
[01:30:51] <Cork> cause it doesn't validate?
[01:30:59] <Cork> there are 4 errors
[01:31:43] <xec> Cork: just out of curiousity, what server side tech do you use?
[01:31:43] <MrBaz> Cork, as long as it doesn't follow objective c, I'll be happy
[01:33:38] <Cork> xec: i think we've talked about this before
[01:33:51] <Cork> rails, ruby, go and python
[01:34:06] <Cork> or in order of use go, rails, ruby, python
[01:34:37] * xec has a goldfish brain
[01:37:27] <Cork> well actually php is in there too
[01:37:38] <Cork> but it is more or less only for one page so :)
[01:37:41] <jop008> no errors http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/19/
[01:37:42] <Cork> *site
[01:37:59] <jop008> no html error why is the tab displayed ugly?
[01:38:10] <guideX> with jquery type() in ie8, the type for [object Arguement] is [object Object] is there some kind of workaround for this?
[01:39:27] <Cork> jop008: sorry clearly not good enough with jqm
[01:40:00] <jop008> I had it good with other sites
[01:40:08] <jop008> so mstt be solvable
[01:40:54] <Cork> guideX: .type looks like it's just a wrapper around typeof + a few exceptions for jquery internals
[01:41:09] <guideX> hmm I see..
[01:41:24] <guideX> I wonder how I would tell the difference? I don't mind adding some conditions or something
[01:41:38] <Cork> check varname.class.name
[01:41:43] <Cork> MIGHT work
[01:41:45] <Cork> not sure
[01:41:49] <guideX> oh cool, let me check..
[01:43:09] <Cork> guideX: sorry it's constructor in js
[01:43:12] <Cork> not class
[01:43:25] <Cork> (and no it doens't work)
[01:43:27] <reuf> I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" on this line of jaascript :  http://paste.ofcode.org/FZMU8rdhivuGpvJB8EApC3 what am i doing wrong?
[01:44:07] <guideX> oh ok
[01:44:09] <guideX> hmm
[01:44:20] <guideX> any other ideas?
[01:44:45] <guideX> maybe I should hover debug and see if I can find anything relevant to an object argument
[01:44:52] <Cork> reuf: make sure you don't have an invisible space in there or simipar
[01:44:56] <Cork> *similar
[01:45:15] <reuf> what can i use to make sure of that?
[01:45:32] <Cork> reuf: a text editor that displays those
[01:48:35] <Cork> guideX: you could try something like .length !== undefined && !instanceof Array
[01:48:50] <Cork> though that would catch { length: 0 } too
[01:49:29] <guideX> hmm
[01:49:32] <guideX> i'll try that
[01:50:42] <yaoOl> hi, I have a table, and it has a delete <a href> for each row, now the request is sent as jQuery ajaxCall and the backend is handle with wtforms.. Some weird thing is happening.
[01:51:10] <reuf>  ive ran it through js hint and js lint and both say its ok
[01:51:35] <Cork> reuf: then remove parts of the string until it works and then go backwards
[01:51:52] <reuf> Cork, thanks
[01:51:57] <guideX> !instanceof <my [object Object or object Argument] here> right?
[01:52:09] <yaoOl> some times when i click the delete very quickly - the browser is not able to handle the return data... it shows as text.. but it renders as html in normal - with .html(response).. any one has any idea ?
[01:52:25] <Cork> if(arguments.length !== undefined && arguments !instanceof Array) {}
[01:52:58] <guideX> oic
[01:54:11] <Cork> yaoOl: hard to tell without seeing it, but might be your leaking variables, or invalid html to name two possibilities
[02:00:42] <yaoOl> looks like - the firbug too is not showing me proper info.
[02:02:41] <guideX> hmm the output of that in chrome is different than that in ie8
[02:03:58] <guideX> it's still not detecting object arguments properly
[02:04:51] <Cork> guideX: you're talking about identify the array like arguments you have in functions right?=
[02:04:58] <Cork> (just to make sure we talk about the same thing)
[02:05:51] <guideX> well when I do like Object.prototype.toString.call(value); in chrome and ff, it can detect a difference between [object Object] and [object Argument] but in ie8, it's always [object Object]
[02:05:58] <guideX> same with jquery type()
[02:06:07] <guideX> it's always object, where sometimes it's argument
[02:06:13] <hexacode> hey you guys..lets say i have 3 horizontal divs taking up the whole page...and theres i change the middle one's height, basically this would shove the div below it down...is there any way that when i change the height of the middle div, i show the one under it and the one above it out of the way instead of just the bottom one? basically i want the middle div to do a take over of the screen
[02:06:13] <Cork> guideX: but that is what you're trying to do right?
[02:06:18] <guideX> yes
[02:06:22] <Cork> guideX: http://jsfiddle.net/PdXht/
[02:06:35] <Cork> !instanceof isn't valid so.. :)
[02:06:40] <Cork> my fault sorry
[02:06:51] <jop008> solved an incorrect heigth on a div
[02:07:10] <guideX> hmm let me try it like that..
[02:07:18] <guideX> oh wait I did
[02:07:18] <guideX> heh
[02:07:28] <guideX> let me try exactly like that
[02:07:29] <guideX> one sec
[02:07:33] <Cork> hexacode: you would have to change the height of the other elements
[02:07:57] <hexacode> oh ok
[02:08:04] <hexacode> triple animation i guess
[02:08:07] <hexacode> no big deal
[02:08:31] <Cork> hexacode: css flex could have solved it if it was supported in all browsers
[02:11:40] <guideX> oo I think this is working :)
[02:12:05] <guideX> just need to tweek it some more, and then it'll work
[02:12:07] <guideX> thanks cork
[02:12:20] <Cork> np
[02:25:38] <yaoOl> Does adding the disabled attr to a <a href> disable the clickability to the <a href> ?
[02:27:18] <Cork> no
[02:27:26] <Cork> yaoOl: for two reasons
[02:27:37] <Cork> attr is for creating attributes not setting properties
[02:27:44] <Cork> for that you should use prop
[02:27:55] <Cork> secondly disabled is only valid on form elements
[02:28:04] <yaoOl> Cork: so using prop ll do the trick ?
[02:28:09] <Cork> that is the elements used with forms
[02:28:13] <Cork> no
[02:28:19] <Cork> for reason 2
[02:29:04] <yaoOl> Cork: How can I then disable the <a href> so as to avoid further clicking and processing those on click of it?
[02:29:21] <Cork> yaoOl: there are a few ways to do that
[02:29:39] <Cork> you could add a class on the element, and in the click handler (if you have one) check for that class
[02:29:55] <Cork> and if it is set, don't do anything (and block the default action)
[02:30:12] <Cork> if you don't use js by default have a dedicated event listener for killing disabled links
[02:30:38] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a.disabled', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[02:30:55] <Cork> (don't forget to style the .disabled class so the user get a visible feedback)
[02:31:22] <yaoOl> Cork: Thanks let me try like this ... and ll get back ... thanks again
[02:37:26] <hexacode> hey you guys i set my page up on ec2 so you guys can help me with this next question..go to http://hexacode.pro   and in chrome console type "$('.canvas .footer').slideDown()"   this doesnt work and i dont know why   but when i do  slide up on the header it work  $('.canvas .header').slideUp();
[02:44:13] <diverdude> Hi, i have this code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6100933/ and i get error: FB.login() called before FB.init().  What am I doing wrong?
[02:44:28] <dweeb_> When I do $('*').on('click', â€¦) my click events gets trigged multiple times. Why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/MR7YF/
[02:46:01] <hexacode> dweeb maybe because u applied it to everything? and when u click on an element inside another element, the click registers in the inside one first, then moves on up to register to the outer one
[02:46:02] <Cork> dwarder: cause you will latterly bind one event listener for every element that exist in the page
[02:46:17] <Cork> dwarder: and as the even bubbles you will trigger the event listeners on all parents
[02:46:26] <Cork> dwarder: basically you should never ever do that
[02:46:34] <hexacode> so it like u made a splash in water and a click ripple hit everything
[02:47:03] <hexacode> and everything responded with another back ripple
[02:47:07] <dweeb_> Cork: So how should I do? I want every element to be clickable.
[02:47:18] <Cork> opps wrong nick :x
[02:47:23] <Cork> dweeb_: bind it to document
[02:47:36] <Cork> $(document).on('click', function() {});
[02:48:05] <Cork> diverdude: well where is login called from?
[02:49:23] <dweeb_> Cork: doh! thanks :)
[02:50:04] <diverdude> Cork, im not really sure about that...but it should be somewhere in that code....soi think its internally somewhere. My guess is that somehow  the code in window.fbAsyncInit is executed after the (function(d, s, id).. code which causes the problem....But i am not really sure how to change that. i have tried putting line 21-27 inside the ajax success after FB.init, but then the ajax function isnt even executed
[02:51:01] <Cork> diverdude: yes, line 21- is definitely running before whats in the fbAsyncInit part
[02:51:32] <Cork> diverdude: as async means it definitely won't run before the next browser tick (and that means at least after the current js stack has existed)
[02:52:52] <diverdude> Cork, hmmm ok thats good to know....but then i dont understand why i get that FB error :(
[02:59:30] <diverdude> Cork, do you have any idea?
[02:59:45] <guideX> is there some way to change a tag to another kind of tag?
[02:59:53] <guideX> for instance, can I change an image to a div or a span?
[02:59:59] <guideX> or something similar
[03:00:10] <guideX> don't want to clone, or append
[03:00:16] <Cork> guideX: that wouldn't make sense
[03:00:32] <guideX> here's the situation.. i'm trying to find a sneaky way to put a video tag in ie8
[03:00:37] <Cork> an image tag can't hold content
[03:00:43] <guideX> i can append an image tag, but I wish to change it to a video tag
[03:00:49] <Cork> and div span is only for the content they hold
[03:01:00] <Cork> guideX: you would have to replace it
[03:01:00] <guideX> and then i'll use video.js to make the video tag work after all that
[03:01:03] <guideX> hmm
[03:01:09] <guideX> ok i'll give it a shot
[03:01:15] <Cork> $('img').replaceWith()
[03:01:24] <guideX> hmm thanks, i'll try it
[03:01:55] <guideX> hmm so I'll have to grab all of its attributes first I bet
[03:02:02] <guideX> like the id, src etc
[03:02:24] <Cork> sure, and if you have any specific event listener added you will lost those
[03:02:32] <Cork> *lose
[03:02:36] <guideX> hmm nope, nothing like that
[03:02:52] <guideX> just need its attributes in tacty
[03:02:53] <guideX> tact
[03:07:28] <guideX> hmm naw that doesn't work..
[03:08:34] <Cork> not sure how you would hold the needed attributes on an img tag for a video tag...
[03:08:44] <diverdude> Cork, i think i found the problem...its caused be very bad error reporting from facebook API
[03:08:47] <Cork> guideX: btw why would you want to do this?
[03:08:53] <Cork> guideX: doesn't really make sense
[03:08:54] <diverdude> Cork,   be=by
[03:10:52] <guideX> Cork: i'm unable to dynamically add a video tag to ie8
[03:11:01] <abailarri> hello. I'm trying to refresh a div in a ajax succes ajax function, but the div desappear. Anyone can help me?
[03:11:12] <Cork> guideX: why do you need to?
[03:11:18] <guideX> I'm creating my video tag like this var msg = "<video .. blah />"; and later need a way to append to the dom
[03:11:19] <Cork> just use the fallback feature
[03:11:26] <guideX> well I plan to with video.js
[03:11:31] <guideX> but first, I need to get a video tag in there
[03:11:43] <Cork> <video><object></object></video>
[03:11:48] <guideX> ie8 will only fall back with video.js after the video tag is in the dom, but I can't add dynamically
[03:12:20] <guideX> hmm <object></object> eh
[03:12:30] <Cork> flash fallback
[03:13:30] <Cork> <video><source type="media/webm"><source type="media/mp4"><object flash for ie></object></video>
[03:13:36] <Cork> should handle it with no need for js
[03:13:50] <guideX> hmm I see...
[03:14:02] <Cork> well except you want to support really old firefox browsers that is
[03:14:02] <guideX> let me see if it'll add it that way
[03:14:15] <guideX> well, I only care about ff (latest)
[03:14:21] <guideX> but ie8 is thrown in that mix :/
[03:14:34] <Cork> ff>8 or something like that should work just fine
[03:14:47] <Cork> *(current is 23)

[03:27:18] <abailarri> anyone know how to refresh the content of a div (not load!)?
[03:38:56] <yaoOl> hey guys, my <a href> turn out to be main culprit, now i Changed to <span > and pput onclick on that.
[03:39:35] <yaoOl> and this is working, but How can i put the clickable mouse to show up on this span - jquery or css ?
[03:40:10] <jallardice_> yaoOl: CSS, `cursor: pointer`
[03:40:23] <yaoOl> jallardice : thanks ..
[04:03:13] <juria_roberts> I have a huge $(document).ready(function(){ function iside which is $(function(){ .In my local enviroment the $(function(){ executes after the rest of the document.ready while in live enviroment it executes immediately.What could be happening?
[04:03:55] <Cork> juria_roberts: would depend on where those other ready functions are defined
[04:04:22] <juria_roberts> Cork: its the same file
[04:04:38] <Cork> juria_roberts: and all the the scripts is in head?
[04:05:19] <juria_roberts> Cork: yes its an external js file called in head
[04:05:44] <Cork> juria_roberts: generically that should not happen
[04:05:53] <Cork> unless you use ajax somewhere around this
[04:06:24] <juria_roberts> Cork: yeah there is ajax called but after  $(function(){ part
[04:06:42] <Cork> juria_roberts: and your not doing any of the ready inside the ajax call?
[04:06:53] <Cork> or inside the fist ready function?
[04:07:23] <Cork> juria_roberts: for example $(document).ready(function(){ is the EXACT same thing as $(function(){
[04:07:33] <juria_roberts> Cork: inside the first ready function but after $(function(){ remember  $(function(){ is also inside the ready function
[04:07:47] <Cork> so you have ready inside ready?
[04:07:48] <Cork> why?
[04:07:55] <juria_roberts> Cork: yeah i know that someone else coded it
[04:08:16] <Cork> juria_roberts: i would not be able to tell exactly what happens without seeing the code
[04:08:22] <Cork> ?p
[04:08:22] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:09:45] <juria_roberts> Cork: gimme 2 mins
[04:13:55] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to send a form, i want the success message to be something like <span>Thank you <?php echo $_POST['name']; ?> , we will contact you soon</span> but when i try it only appears the text and a gap instead of showing that input. any help?
[04:14:35] <Cork> dieguezz: that would be a php question not a js question
[04:14:41] <Cork> you can't run php from js
[04:18:54] <gonnarule> hi there
[04:19:45] <gonnarule> I'm trying to use .contents (http://api.jquery.com/contents/) to customize the content of an iframe, but it isn't working (exactly the code of the example). Any idea ? the iframe is pointing to another website (not our domain)
[04:19:50] <r1card> "input:checkbox:not(:checked)" <-- seems to stop working once I check/uncheck the box manually
[04:20:01] <r1card> It reports checked boxes as unchecked
[04:20:37] <Cork> gonnarule: is the content of the iframe from a different domain?
[04:21:12] <Cork> r1card: what are you doing with the selector?
[04:21:41] <r1card> Cork, I'm using to count unchecked checkboxes (then I toggle them off/on depending)
[04:21:51] <Cork> full code line
[04:21:57] <gonnarule> Cork : yes
[04:22:03] <dieguezz> Cork, but, can i save the post input into a jquery variable and then do something like $('#successl').html("Ty"+ "<strong>"+namel+"</strong>"+"we will contact you soon") ?
[04:22:12] <Cork> gonnarule: you can't access the content of third party domains
[04:22:37] <Cork> dieguezz: sure
[04:22:48] <Cork> dieguezz: php exists server side, and js runs client side
[04:22:50] <r1card> var checkboxes = $('#results input:checkbox');
[04:22:56] <r1card> if ($('#results input:checkbox:not(:checked)').length) {checkboxes.removeAttr('checked');} else {checkboxes.attr('checked', true);}
[04:23:27] <gonnarule> Cork : ok, dammit
[04:23:52] <Cork> r1card: try if(!checkboxes.is(':checked')) {} else {}
[04:24:25] <r1card> Cork, what is the precise meaning of that result on multiple elements/
[04:24:31] <juria_roberts> Cork: http://pastebin.com/h4MBaayu
[04:24:33] <r1card> Some checked, some unchecked = false or true?
[04:25:02] <Cork> ?.is @ r1card
[04:25:03] <raj> I'm going to www.mysite.com/raj#top and both window.onstatechange and window.onanchorchange are firing!

[04:25:42] <r1card> :}
[04:25:50] <Cork> ugg the bots are slow >_<
[04:26:35] <r1card> Cork, same behavior as before.
[04:26:46] <raj> I have window.onstatechange=urlDispatcher, and window.onanchorchange=urlDispatcher
[04:26:51] <r1card> Cork, works once, then once the checkboxes are modified it starts returning wrong results.
[04:26:58] <Cork> r1card: hmm, that doesn't really make sense
[04:27:03] <r1card> Well.
[04:27:03] <raj> but I don't want to hit the dispatcher twice, obviously
[04:27:12] <Cork> r1card: could you build a small testcase in jsfiddle?
[04:27:27] <juria_roberts> Cork: I hope u get time to look at the code :)
[04:27:32] <r1card> I'll try Cork. Seems like a bug in jQuery though.
[04:27:52] <Cork> r1card: i'm quite sure it normally works, and if anything it would be a bug in the dom
[04:28:10] <Cork> r1card: but please a testcase
[04:28:42] <Cork> juria_roberts: and what part is running too early?
[04:28:48] <Cork> (line number)
[04:30:21] <Cork> juria_roberts: sidenote .live() is depricated and removed in 1.9
[04:30:37] <Cork> juria_roberts: you should look into using .delegate or .on instead
[04:31:05] <r1card> Cork, Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/BFVsB/
[04:31:18] <juria_roberts> Cork: shouldn't line no 14 be executed immediately ...but it is being executed after all the ajax calls below it
[04:31:32] <r1card> Cork, also Safari, tested.
[04:32:33] <r1card> Cork, also confirmed in Opera, Firefox.
[04:32:51] <Cork> juria_roberts: well $(function(){ should as long as domcontentloaded has fired
[04:33:54] <r1card> Cork, testing if 1.9.1 also does that.
[04:34:20] <Cork> juria_roberts: but ya, you have quite a few places that might cause thinks to run out of order based on when it happens to run
[04:34:27] <juria_roberts> Cork: in live its firing but in local it fires after the outer document ready has finished executing
[04:35:11] <Cork> r1card: that code there doesn't really make sense
[04:35:16] <r1card> Cork, went down to 1.3.2, and it works there.
[04:35:29] <r1card> Cork, so jQuery bug. The code makes the following sense:
[04:35:53] <r1card> 1) If there are 0+ checked checkboxes, check all  2) if all are checked, uncheck all
[04:36:17] <Cork> r1card: ya, your problem is amoung other thing the use of attr
[04:36:32] <r1card> Cork, it happens when I directly click the checkboxes too.
[04:36:40] <r1card> Cork, but how should I check/uncheck checkboxes.
[04:36:55] <Cork> r1card: http://jsfiddle.net/BFVsB/3/
[04:37:17] <Cork> r1card: attribute != property
[04:37:57] <Cork> and yes jquery 1.3 and earlier tried to hide this fackt
[04:38:07] <Cork> *fact
[04:38:19] <Cork> but it caused bugs, and was split up into two calls
[04:38:22] <r1card> Cork, I see.
[04:38:26] <r1card> Cork, thank you very much.
[04:38:32] <r1card> Honestly never used prop before :}
[04:38:44] <Cork> r1card: if you want to modify the property use prop
[04:38:52] <Cork> if you want the text string entered into the html tag use attr
[04:39:07] <Cork> never ever use attr to try to change states in the browser
[04:39:51] <r1card> Cork, thank you! :)
[04:39:54] <Cork> np
[04:40:14] <dieguezz> Cork, i tried to save the value of the input field i wanted to use in welcome message and used it as i said before, but its doing weird things. For example, first time you send it it works, but if i reload and retry, i keep getting last value.. if i do it from anonymous browser, it just doesnt work. this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/8R26P/3/
[04:41:13] <raj> Mr. Cork, how can I prevent onstatechange and onanchorchange from both firing during a fresh page load of www.mysite.com/raj#side? Alternatively, how can I get onhashchange to fire when going from www.mysite.com/raj --> www.mysite.com/raj#side ?
[04:42:00] <Cork> dieguezz: where do you get the data from?
[04:42:02] <raj> or should I not be using hashchanges to determine layout?
[04:42:12] <Cork> dieguezz: i don't see you using the return value from ajax
[04:42:13] <dieguezz> from an input field with an id
[04:42:20] <Cork> (the data argument)
[04:42:42] <Cork> and where it the user name?
[04:43:07] <dieguezz> can you put an example? i am noob xD th user name will be the field "familia" with id="nombre"
[04:43:28] <Cork> dieguezz: i don't see any code that actually changes the content at all
[04:43:33] <Cork> so can't really do that
[04:43:47] <Cork> dieguezz: when you submit with ajax, you don't reload the page
[04:43:52] <raj> I'm updating the url with a hash, and which then I want to get picked up by window.onstatechange (or the like), at which point it reaches my urlDispatch, which renders/alters a page accordingly
[04:43:58] <Cork> so if php changes something there it won't affect the page
[04:44:15] <dieguezz> well, i get the value of the input field with jquery
[04:44:39] <dieguezz> line 74
[04:44:52] <raj> otherwise, instead of updating the url with the hash (which causes the rest of the cascade), I could instead just directly make the renders/alters right there
[04:45:05] <Cork> dieguezz: wait
[04:45:17] <Cork> you mean you meant that show(p1) should show the username?
[04:45:26] <dieguezz> i thought so :S
[04:45:29] <Cork> (think i might be on to the problem)
[04:45:31] <Cork> ok
[04:45:42] <Cork> show is to change the state of the element
[04:45:52] <Cork> you use .text() or .html() to change the content
[04:46:02] <dieguezz> ohh ok! omg...

[04:47:09] <toxz> how can i trigger a change event from an input without jquery so that the bound event-callbacks in jquery get fired?
[04:47:28] <Cork> toxz: you can't
[04:47:34] <toxz> :-(
[04:47:43] <Cork> toxz: jquery has an internal list of the events it has bound
[04:47:59] <Cork> and when you use trigger it will build a list from that and call the functions it knows of
[04:48:19] <yaoOl> My prob got resolve by replacing the <ahref> to <span >, the thing is that click of my <a href> submits a form thru jquery. And that deletes and entry and removes that particular entry from the table.
[04:48:26] <toxz> but isnt it possible to fire the event like the browser does if i type something into a field and leave it - like the change event itself?
[04:48:32] <Cork> toxz: that said, you could try doing something like elm.change() i don't think that works, but it might
[04:48:55] <yaoOl> But looks like, clicking repeatedly on that link whch got removed was creating the havoc..
[04:49:10] <Cork> toxz: some events you can fake, but not all
[04:49:20] <Cork> not sure if change is one of them
[04:49:28] <toxz> the problem is i have 2 version of jquery, and i need to fire a change event so that the callback bound with both versions get fired
[04:49:37] <raj> yaoOl, ev.preventDefault() might help that
[04:49:44] <raj> to prevent the form from submitting
[04:49:57] <Cork> toxz: ya, domelm.change() is the only chance
[04:50:10] <toxz> i've tried this, but it doesnt work
[04:50:12] <Cork> (or better remove one of the duplicate jquery frameworks)
[04:50:24] <toxz> sadly thats not possible
[04:50:36] <Cork> toxz: then use both objects and call it
[04:50:38] <yaoOl> I tried that, but not much help. As in the backend my form uses wtform.. and excpetion were throwing out as and empty request got posted at the backend.
[04:50:41] <toxz> not now and with this progress of implementation
[04:50:49] <Cork> jq1(elm).change(); jq2(elm).change()
[04:50:51] <yaoOl> I use the ajaxCall to post the data
[04:51:16] <raj> oh, thought you meant it was a hard submit
[04:51:35] <toxz> Cork: yeah - but i have 2 plugins and i did not want to wire them together. just using simple events like "change" - i have not expected these complications
[04:51:53] <yaoOl> no no .. my mistake if i said so.. but I m sending like that
[04:52:11] <raj> kk
[04:52:20] <Cork> toxz: so make a third little lib to act as the go-between
[04:52:20] <toxz> mmm - really bad
[04:52:45] <Cork> and give it a hook to allow adding libs
[04:52:55] <Cork> and then just have it call the same commands on all of them
[04:53:06] <dieguezz> [Cork] $("#success").html("Gracias familia"+p1+", pronto nos pondremos en contacto."); should work? it doesnt show any error msg :S
[04:53:44] <Cork> dieguezz: and console.log($("#success").length) is 1 ?
[04:53:55] <toxz> Cork: i already use the older version of jQuery in the newer plugin, but i did not want to wire back in the other direction. yeah thanks for the advice with the middle-earth lib :-) i'll have to think about it. thankfully today is the deadline for the project :-(
[04:53:58] <yaoOl> what i m still thinking - what is actually the prob..
[04:54:41] <yaoOl> ,a href> has its click and i also have abound to a click handler too on that .. was wondering, could it be the prob.. like that
[04:55:04] <Cork> toxz: you could extend trigger in the new lib and hook in trigger from the old lib
[04:55:22] <Cork> toxz: that way the old lib would be called, but when it gets removed you can just drop the extension
[04:56:35] <toxz> Cork: i
[04:57:09] <toxz> Cork: i'll think about it. now it must be the other way. in the older version change event is fired and i need to react in the newer one
[04:57:47] <toxz> jquery 1.2.6 vs. 1.10.2
[04:58:54] <Cork> toxz: (function($) { var org = $.fn.trigger; $.fn.trigger = function() { oldJquery.fn.trigger.apply(oldJquery($.makeArray(this)), arguments); return org.apply(this, arguments); } })(newjQuery);
[04:59:32] <Cork> (not sure if makeArray is needed there)
[04:59:43] <Cork> added it to make sure you got the correct jquery object to work on
[04:59:52] <toxz> Cork: nice - ill take a deeper look on this
[05:00:05] <sammich> any jquery equiv of http://livedocs.dojotoolkit.org/dojo/topic?
[05:00:59] <Cork> sammich: no
[05:01:10] <Cork> there are most likely plugins for it though
[05:01:19] <Cork> websocket would be a starting point for me
[05:01:21] <sammich> isn't it really just a function repository?

[05:27:00] <bobdobbs> I think I'm actually sending the data. But burp shows the request as a GET request
[05:27:15] <bobdobbs> Is that normal?
[05:27:49] <bobdobbs> oh wait... I was looking at the wrong request
[05:27:56] <bobdobbs> It is a post request after all

[05:33:26] <Tingle> anyone know which library is the best that lets you use the jquery animate() function but uses css if the browser supports it and fallsback to jquery if it doesnt? I've found like 3-4 and not sure which one I should use
[05:33:28] <grafi> ok
[05:33:29] <grafi> ^^
[05:44:29] <toxz> Cork: hey i've tried on your idea. now i made it the way round. i want to fire the bound events from the newer jquery version when the events for the older version are fired. i've "did" it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/KjcCq/ - but the events from the newer version get not fired! do you have an idea?
[05:46:12] <Cork> toxz: you remove apply
[05:47:31] <toxz> Cork: damn - thats right. didnt see that. now i get a real error "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Array] has no method 'each' " :-)
[05:48:19] <Cork> toxz: aaand you removed the wrapping of the object :)
[05:48:44] <Cork> newjq.fn.trigger.apply(newjq(newjq.makeArray(this)), arguments)
[05:49:37] <grafi> :o
[05:50:20] <toxz> Cork: man you're the jquery god!

[05:53:01] <Cork> O_o
[06:04:38] <Granjow> When I define a $elem.click() event and then append the $elem to the page, it will not fire. Is this how it should be and is it guaranteed to stay this way?
[06:13:48] <grafi> works fine for me Granjow
[06:13:53] <grafi> show some code
[06:16:05] <Granjow> grafi: It is a bit hard to extract it here. What I do is that I append it to an element, and when the page is updated, I remove all the elements with element.empty() and add them again (in a different order).
[06:16:16] <Granjow> Does .empty() maybe remove the events on the elements?
[06:16:31] <Granjow> Ah yes it does
[06:16:47] <grafi> ^^

[06:37:18] <ElysiumNet> is there an easy way to detect when someone writes a questionmark?
[06:37:40] <ElysiumNet> instead of checking whether shift is pressed and a particular key on the keyboard is pressed?
[06:38:50] <vshjxyz> why don't you just check the char pressed on the event? or the whole string... it depends on what are you doing
[06:39:27] <ElysiumNet> vshjxyz: it works on keypress, but I need to override default browser behaviour in keydown... which prevents it from bubbling up to keypress
[06:44:43] <SkyHunter> Hi, why does ("$$$$$").replace("$$$$$","$$$$$") return "$$$"?
[06:45:04] <ElysiumNet> vshjxyz: http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html see this for example
[06:46:44] <Cork> SkyHunter: ("$$$$$").replace("\\$\\$\\$\\$\\$","$$$$$")
[06:47:05] <Cork> opps wrong example
[06:47:24] <SkyHunter> Is $ somekind of special character for replace?

[06:48:21] <Cork> SkyHunter: yes

[06:48:36] <bot-t1> Cork: "$$$$$"
[06:48:54] <Cork> SkyHunter: $ is used as variable reference
[06:49:34] <SkyHunter> Ah thank you. I was so confused, because I've a string seperated by some $ chars and i always had wierd results.

[06:50:33] <doug65536> soahccc: location.replace("new_url")
[06:51:06] <vshjxyz> ElysiumNet: yep, http://www.javascripter.net/faq/keycodes.htm and http://javascript.info/tutorial/keyboard-events#working-with-scan-codes-keydown-keyup says that there's no easy way because it's not standardized :\
[06:51:07] <soahccc> I only find a lot of history plugins but I actually don't want to alter the history. And to be clear changing the URL means without reload
[06:51:33] <Cork> soahccc: window.location.replaceState()
[06:51:38] <Velveeta> elysium: still working on that issue from last night with your shortcuts?
[06:51:43] <Cork> ?mdn replaceState
[06:51:45] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[06:51:45] <bot-t1> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn replaceState" in jQuery Docs.
[06:51:53] <soahccc> I could use replaceState I guess but what is the easiest way to merge a param in a string URL
[06:52:34] <Cork> soahccc: you would have to grab the search section from window.location.search
[06:52:49] <Cork> modify the string to be correcrt
[06:52:55] <soahccc> history.js has a wrapper for the URL part but I think you can't apply it on a link inside the page
[06:53:02] <ElysiumNet> vshjxyz: keypress does what I want, but I can't get keydown to bubble up to keypress while overriding default browser shortcuts
[06:53:03] <Cork> and then use pathname and the like to build the final url
[06:53:03] <doug65536> Cork: why would you suggest a barely-supported function?
[06:53:22] <doug65536> Cork: what does replaceState do that location.replace wouldn't in this scenario
[06:53:23] <Cork> doug65536: it is supported everywhere except in ie
[06:53:39] <Cork> doug65536: the "not in history" part
[06:53:59] <doug65536> location.replace replaces this page's history entry with the parameter
[06:54:12] <Cork> doug65536: and the "without reloading url"
[06:55:06] <doug65536> ah without reload... lame
[06:55:18] <soahccc> Cork: okay I think this leads to regexp and / or fiddeling? Coming from the rails sector I miss something like $.paramsFromStr(link.href).merge(foo: "bar").param()... basically the first part is missing
[06:55:26] <Cork> doug65536: and working in all modern == barely suppoerted
[06:55:33] <Cork> not sure how you connect that
[06:56:04] <doug65536> Cork: my definition of "supported" is "works on more than just the latest"
[06:56:08] <Cork> soahccc: there are jquery plugins for managing the params
[06:56:18] <Cork> doug65536: and latest == ie?
[06:56:30] <Cork> cause it has worked for more then 10 versions on the other ones
[06:56:34] <soahccc> It not even that big of a deal just toggling true/false strings or add them if not in the URL so I'm a bit afraid to use a BBQ monster
[06:58:47] <beasty> mmm
[06:58:54] <beasty> is it hard to created group sorting ?
[06:59:10] <beasty> let me draw it out sec
[06:59:10] <Cork> beasty: what's group?
[06:59:58] <Velveeta> do you mean sorting an array of objects based on more than 1 property?
[07:00:26] <beasty> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/030c79fbfb2fc81678ed
[07:00:43] <beasty> the headcat needs to be sortable
[07:00:54] <beasty> and the cat in the heads need also be sortable
[07:02:25] <slax0r> $('selector').each(function(){if(parseInt($(this).css("zIndex"), 10)===1){...}});
[07:02:45] <slax0r> can I already use that condition within the selector? so I don't have to iterate through every item?
[07:03:25] <otiuk> is there a way to make variables completely global so that way they are shared within all functions? .. like in php you just can grab them by going global $var; but is there similar functionality with js?
[07:04:06] <slax0r> define them in a global scope
[07:04:39] <slax0r> like var myVar = 0; $(document).ready(function() { alert(myVar); });
[07:05:41] <beasty> Cork: heads must sortable and cats must be sortable
[07:05:49] <beasty> also cats must move along when head is sorted
[07:07:17] <otiuk> slax0r:  so just have to be set before the use in functions and then when they are called/set/reset in the functions they should work globally?
[07:08:24] <slax0r> otiuk, don't know if it works across .js files, you'd have to test that your self, but within the file, if you define a var oustide any function, you can freely use it, yes
[07:09:46] <otiuk> slax0r: ok and then when manipulating them do you leave off the var .. so like originally you'd do var variable = 0; and then within the function if i wanted to set it to 1 ... go variable = 1; or would/should I do var variable = 1?
[07:22:25] <derelm> i am doing a $.getJSON ajax request but no request is generated - instead if i install an ajaxError handler i see that my jqXHR is in status "rejected" -can someone please explain what that means?
[07:27:03] <derelm> also, when i force reload the page with that $.getJSON on it those calls will succeed
[07:38:59] <xec> derelm: is the request made on a page of the same domain as the ajax url?
[07:39:19] <derelm> xec: yes
[07:39:23] <dean[h]> I have a problem with iOS + Android. I have a click event which toggles a class on an object. The problem is this object has the same styling for the css :hover selector as if the .selected class is applied. So what happens is I tap the object, the selected class is applied using toggleClass correctly. But when I tap it again the toggleClass is fired, but the hover state is left over making it feel as if you didn't untap the object
[07:39:32] <dean[h]> What I think is happening is after i tap, the click event is fired which removes my .selected class, but the hover pseudo selector still matches, almost in a ghost-like manner
[07:39:44] <xec> derelm: what does your code look like?
[07:39:55] <derelm> xec: forcing my browser to reload the page with that code makes it work
[07:40:43] <xec> dean[h]: so, the button applies a class to itself?
[07:40:56] <dean[h]> When you click it, it toggles a class, but basically yep
[07:41:06] <xec> then sure, that makes sense
[07:41:35] <son_> Hi guys
[07:41:46] <dean[h]> What doesn't make sense is why ios is lingering the hover even after i am not touching? xec
[07:41:50] <son_> Can I ask this dummy question?
[07:41:58] <BillCriswell> son_: Yeah. I love those.
[07:42:15] <son_> If I have multiple jQuery versions on one page
[07:42:17] <xec> dean[h]: well, as there is no real hover on touch devices, they apply :hover on click
[07:42:31] <BillCriswell> I swear the more effort I put into a stackoverflow answer the more it's ignored.
[07:42:34] <son_> can I use the jQuery.noConlict() to ensure nothing explodes?
[07:43:12] <derelm> xec: code basically looks like this http://pastebin.com/9iBSfmuz
[07:43:49] <dean[h]> xec: seems that way, but i need to fix it. i have a series of objects that can be "selected" but not unselected right now because of the hover bug. here is a reproducable test case (if you load it on iOS) http://jsfiddle.net/JTJE6/
[07:44:48] <BillCriswell> Just calling it won't make sure of that, using it properly may ensure that.
[07:44:53] <BillCriswell> son_: ^^
[07:45:27] <xec> dean[h]: you could make sure the :hover only applies to non-touch devices http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2741816
[07:45:35] <BillCriswell> son_: Just using $.noConflict() would give $ back to the first version of jQuery you loaded.
[07:45:42] <dean[h]> that's an interesting approach xec
[07:45:47] <dean[h]> i like it
[07:47:12] <son_> Cool
[07:47:24] <son_> Thanks BillCriswell
[07:47:41] <son_> or BillCriswell_
[07:47:56] <grafi> or BillCriswell__
[07:48:18] <BillCriswell> If youAm I multiplying?
[07:48:25] <grafi> or BillCriswell____
[07:48:36] <son_> lol
[07:48:37] <grafi> are you I
[07:48:37] <grafi> ?
[07:48:45] <Bacta> Should I be using a CDN in production?
[07:48:46] <grafi> who am he
[07:49:23] <grafi> as long as you make sure you provide a fallback
[07:49:23] <dean[h]> xec, it worked flawlessly. thank you for the easy suggestion
[07:49:25] <grafi> why not?
[07:50:28] <BillCriswell> son_: Ideally you'd only want one version of jQuery loaded.
[07:50:51] <BillCriswell> son_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ This explains things clearly.
[07:50:57] <son_> Thank you
[07:51:06] <BillCriswell> I was wrong when I said "Just using $.noConflict() would give $ back to the first version of jQuery you loaded."
[07:51:29] <son_> I know that (someone is going to kill me for doing this multiple version thingy)
[07:52:22] <son_> basically now I have a bunch of pages
[07:52:32] <son_> some of them have jquery loaded already
[07:52:36] <son_> some do not
[07:52:47] <T13|needsCoffee> What is wrong with $('.thisclass > a:link').  ??
[07:53:15] <son_> so I'm just lazy to check the existence of jQuery with serverside + clientside
[07:53:20] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: I think the :link part.
[07:53:26] <son_> doing it the lazy way atm
[07:53:35] <BillCriswell> son_: Got it.
[07:54:01] <T13|needsCoffee> a:link works until I put it after .myclass >
[07:54:18] <son_> Anyway thanks again BillCriswell_
[07:54:24] <son_> and nice weekend
[07:54:25] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: Hmmm... then a:link isn't a direct child of .thisclass then.
[07:54:31] <BillCriswell> son_: You as well!
[07:54:36] <son_> running away soon ..
[07:55:40] <T13|needsCoffee> Ahh getting rid of the > did it
[07:55:42] <T13|needsCoffee> Thanks
[07:55:46] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:56:35] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: What does the :link part do exactly?
[07:56:39] <CrysAk> question : i want my alert box to have yes/no or ok/cancle .. im using (alert(data) atm.. what should i be using and i need to check if ok/cancle / yes/no is clicked too..
[07:57:25] <T13|needsCoffee> Changes the css of links, but not on :hover or :visited
[07:57:26] <MrBaz> crysak, use confirm rather then alert
[07:57:29] <CrysAk> ahhhh
[07:57:34] <T13|needsCoffee> Iirc
[07:57:39] <MrBaz> returns true or false
[07:57:42] <CrysAk> yea thanks, only just found a google reply with that :)^^ typical timing .. thanks :)
[07:57:48] <MrBaz> if(confirm("my message"))
[07:59:57] <CrysAk> ahhhh you don;t need to fire it before, thanks :)
[08:00:10] <MrBaz> Fire it before ?
[08:00:10] <T13|needsCoffee> BillCriswell: http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_link.asp
[08:00:28] <CrysAk> confrim(data); if(confirm(data){}
[08:00:28] <BillCriswell> T13|needsCoffee: I knew what it did in CSS but trying to get the purpose of it in the selector.
[08:00:33] <shoky> T13|needsCoffee: jquery doesn't know :link
[08:00:37] <CrysAk> was triggereing it twice ^^
[08:00:40] <T13|needsCoffee> And yes.. I know w3schools is horrible
[08:00:42] <MrBaz> yep
[08:00:53] <MrBaz> most common is with a return
[08:01:14] <MrBaz> onclick="return confirm(\"foo bar?\")"
[08:01:17] <Velveeta> we like to ask our interview candidates to list some of their online resourcesâ€¦ minus points for w3schools :D
[08:01:26] <BillCriswell> well, in your CSS selector. I think you're fine with just "a".
[08:01:57] <CrysAk> why does everyone hate w3schools .. i know it's not 100% correct but it was a GREAT introduction to web programming for people without prior experiance before users can learn to understand the php/jquery/mysql official documentation in isolation
[08:02:14] <MrBaz> tigzag is a hell of a lot better ?
[08:02:22] <Velveeta> i use mdn myself
[08:02:24] * CrysAk googles
[08:02:35] <NoiseEee> `w3fools
[08:02:40] <BillCriswell> CrysAk: I agree. It's like putting down a dog that has a couple fleas.
[08:02:40] <T13|needsCoffee> Http://www.w3fools.com iirc
[08:02:41] <MrBaz> http://www.tizag.com/
[08:02:45] <Velveeta> glad i checked that autocorrect, colloquy tried to change mdn to men, which i don't use myself...
[08:02:46] <CrysAk> oh yea ^^
[08:03:08] <CrysAk> didn't know about tizag
[08:03:15] <MrBaz> now you do :)
[08:03:46] <CrysAk> yea that w3fools is all well and good bashing something that's shit.. but then not to provide an alternative is equaly as shit :P
[08:03:51] <BillCriswell> I learned form HTML Goodies years ago ahah
[08:04:38] <BillCriswell> They suggest webplatform.org at the bottom.
[08:04:46] <MrBaz> w3fools has 4 alternatives
[08:04:58] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://devdocs.io/ I've been using this to look things up recently.
[08:05:37] <Velveeta> Bill: nice, i'll have to add that to my list :)
[08:05:43] <MrBaz> I am a firm believer googling issues is a skill, often you need to know WHAT to google to get the info you need.
[08:06:06] <BillCriswell> MrBaz: Absolutely.
[08:06:13] <MrBaz> right
[08:06:18] <MrBaz> clocking out time
[08:06:22] <MrBaz> later
[08:06:34] <jedimind> MrBaz i once got offered a job because i knew how to google an answer
[08:06:34] <Velveeta> right, i had a former professor say something to me when i was still in school, which has stuck w/ me to this dayâ€¦ a good IT professional isn't one that knows all the answers, it's one that knows how to FIND all the answers when they need to...
[08:06:36] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Agreed. I think it's awesome.
[08:06:37] <jedimind> during the interview
[08:06:40] <Velveeta> adios MrBaz
[08:06:49] <jedimind> they asked me a question and i siad "i have no clue, but i would google it in about 3 seconds"
[08:07:13] <MrBaz> Velveeta,  I'm evnvious, I;ve had to site mini exams in all mine hah
[08:07:15] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha, nice.
[08:07:24] <CrysAk> jedimind,  people with the ability to learn fast and understand new concepts > people that already understand them and are unwilling to advance
[08:07:31] <jedimind> absolutely
[08:07:42] <Velveeta> heheheh
[08:07:52] <CrysAk> spent half of my day googling other peoples questions at my old job :/
[08:08:01] <jedimind> the longer i am in this industry, the more i realize that i dont really need to know too much off the top of my head, but really just catalogue how to get to that information for when i need it
[08:08:02] <MrBaz> had a personality exam too for my first one, that was a bit odd
[08:08:07] <CrysAk> apprently my machine was the only one with access to google
[08:08:17] <jedimind> and i refuse to do technical tests for interviews
[08:08:23] <MrBaz> why  ?
[08:08:34] <jedimind> because they're never a clear representation of what you know
[08:08:42] <BillCriswell> jedimind: "Never memorize something that you can look up"
[08:08:49] <jedimind> so what if you dont remember the minutae something syntactical bullshit
[08:09:03] <grafi> [17:08:16] <CrysAk> apprently my machine was the only one with access to google << hahaha thats what everyone I know seems to think too
[08:09:09] <Velveeta> jedi: we like to give our candidates a tic tac toe implementation exercise on occasion, if we're on the fence after an interview
[08:09:15] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha, technical tests make me feel smart... even though I'm probably not as smart as they lead people to think.
[08:09:18] <grafi> "so you know stuff about computer, huh"
[08:09:27] <CrysAk> lol
[08:09:29] <MrBaz> I think your both wrong, most of the time they cover whats expected to know. I have never really had anything which you cant do with a good grasp on the language and oop
[08:09:29] <Velveeta> it's simple enough that everybody knows the rules of the game, and leaves enough room for optimization that we can see what they do with it as part of their development style
[08:09:29] <BillCriswell> "so... computed stuff, eh."
[08:09:47] <BillCriswell> computer*
[08:09:58] <grafi> "i dont know, did you google it yet?"
[08:10:01] <grafi> "no"
[08:10:05] <grafi> "FUCK YOU"
[08:10:06] <grafi> :D
[08:10:08] <Velveeta> lmgtfy.com
[08:10:12] <CrysAk> that being said i am in here / #php / #css / #mysql asking questions ALOT that usualy get a faster answer from people than googling something i don;t know the correct term/syntax for
[08:10:33] <grafi> true
[08:10:34] <jedimind> read this: https://medium.com/lessons-learned/80ba19c55883
[08:10:39] <jedimind> regarding tech interviews
[08:10:42] <BillCriswell> I wish duckduckgos name was more... verbable.
[08:10:56] <MrBaz> exit
[08:11:01] <grafi> but thats generally not the case for the stuff my family/friends are having trouble with :P
[08:11:34] <grafi> BillCriswell just duckduck it
[08:11:40] <grafi> <:
[08:12:01] <BillCriswell> grafi: "bing it" sounds good, somehow "google it" sounds good... "duckduckgo it" just doesn't flow.
[08:12:26] <jedimind> [11:10:43] <BillCriswell>	 I wish duckduckgos name was more... verbable.
[08:12:30] <jedimind> that is a great sentence
[08:12:38] <Velveeta> i remember a quote from a coworker of mine at a past jobâ€¦ "how do i get to bing? google will tell me!"
[08:13:08] <grafi> duck it
[08:13:11] <grafi> eh
[08:13:12] <grafi> fuck it
[08:13:13] <grafi> :D
[08:13:39] <BillCriswell> Haha. That's how I feel after some searched with duck duck go sadly. =( It's getting better though!
[08:13:47] <grafi> "bing it" only happens in those american tv shows that suddenly carry their surface tablet everywhere
[08:13:51] <BillCriswell> some searches*
[08:13:56] <grafi> i always find it hilarious
[08:19:13] <BillCriswell> jedimind: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-De5esaUFCxRmpTMXloMDNvcFk/edit?usp=sharing I was told to code the HTML / CSS / Javascript for this on a phone interview once. I thought it was kind of fun, but kind of hard to while explaining what I'm thinking on the phone.
[08:20:54] <jedimind> BillCriswell i mean its not like id have a problem with doing that either, but its not nearly representative of what i do
[08:21:01] <jedimind> so i probably would decline a job offer
[08:21:15] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Definitely understood.
[08:32:37] <grafi> what is that supposed to be BillCriswell oÃ´
[08:33:28] <BillCriswell> grafi: What do you mean?
[08:33:45] <grafi> todo app for phone interview?
[08:33:46] <grafi> oÃ´
[08:34:19] <saltcod> Hey all â€” I'd like to write a JS bookmarklet.  Reading long pieces is almost impossible on certain. I'd like my bookmarklet to let you draw a resizable box around a content area, and blur the rest.  Like this http://cl.ly/image/2S0I0e0L0i44
[08:34:20] <BillCriswell> grafi: Ah, yes. They just showed me that image and was like "code it and explain it your thought process along the way"
[08:34:34] <grafi> hm
[08:35:04] <BillCriswell> grafi: It sucked because I had to work in basically an HTML text area.
[08:35:19] <BillCriswell> textarea*
[08:35:23] <grafi> oO
[08:35:28] <grafi> and explain on the phone ^^
[08:35:43] <BillCriswell> grafi: Yeah, it was brutal haha
[08:36:08] <grafi> idk
[08:36:22] <saltcod> Basically, I don't even know where to start googling about it.
[08:36:38] <BillCriswell> They ended up not hiring me because they didn't think I wanted to work there, which was kind of true I was doing it for fun but I kind of wish the offer was made.
[08:36:54] <grafi> interesting
[08:37:00] <Velveeta> bill: we're hiring, feel like moving to austin? :D
[08:37:03] <BillCriswell> "You didn't ask any questions about the position, which set off some red flags"
[08:37:09] <grafi> how they read you like a book :P
[08:37:17] <grafi> hm
[08:37:26] <grafi> hiring
[08:37:28] <grafi> brrrrr
[08:37:33] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha, too hot in Austin!
[08:37:40] <Velveeta> got that right
[08:37:43] <Velveeta> :D
[08:38:12] <grafi> Velveetas company builds todo apps on a daily basis BillCriswell could be your dream job
[08:38:13] <grafi> :p
[08:38:20] <BillCriswell> I'm cranky at > 75 degrees
[08:39:13] <Velveeta> all we do is todomvc implementations
[08:39:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Angular and Ember more or less/
[08:39:45] <Velveeta> although we have made the occasional contribution to vapor.js
[08:40:11] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: The chart on their home page is awesome.
[08:40:35] <BillCriswell> Ohhh, duh. Looks at the repo.
[08:40:48] <Velveeta> ok so maybe we do *slightly* more than todomvc implementations.. and also, minus the todomvc stuff :D
[08:41:24] <Velveeta> one thing i find funny about vapor.js is that the packed version is larger than the standard version
[08:42:05] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:42:43] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I hear Austin is awesome however.
[08:42:54] <Velveeta> it is definitely awesome
[08:43:01] <Velveeta> and we get the x games here now, for the next 4 years i think
[08:43:39] <Velveeta> but it is hotâ€¦ a couple of years ago we had our record for 100+ degree daysâ€¦ 90 of them in a summer
[08:43:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Last time the X-Games were in Philly I was fit enough to skate, and did get to skate with a lot of the greats.
[08:43:52] <Velveeta> nice
[08:44:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, it was so much fun. They had to run from security just like the rest of us.
[08:44:55] <Velveeta> lol
[08:45:17] <Velveeta> i'm hoping bob burnquist shows up so i can scream like a girl and faint, and then blame it on heat stroke or something
[08:46:22] <TelFiRE> Does anyone know of a slide show plugin that will properly initialize on elements that start hidden?
[08:46:29] <BillCriswell> Haha nice. I was more of a street fan.
[08:47:53] <Velveeta> i was terrible at skateboarding when i was a kid, if i were to ever compete in anything, it would have been bmx park
[08:48:14] <BillCriswell> Rodney Mullen as a skateboarder is the type of developer I want to be. Only difference is he's brilliant and talented.
[08:48:15] <Velveeta> but alas, my body has succumb to the ravages of time and a typical american diet
[08:48:39] <Velveeta> "Only difference is he's brilliant and talented." :D
[08:48:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I stopped rollerblading cause it was "too easy" and got into skateboarding, never got nearly as good on a skateboard as I was on rollerblades, but I had a lot more fun since it was so much more difficult.
[08:49:10] <Velveeta> that reminds me of a comment i made one day: "coke and pepsi are essentially the exact same product when you really think about it.. the only real difference between the 2 is the fucking godawful disgusting flavor of pepsi"
[08:49:46] <TelFiRE> lies! coke is gross!
[08:49:54] <Velveeta> blasphemer!
[08:50:21] <BillCriswell> I only like Coke from a can. Otherwise I don't care for either haha
[08:51:27] <Velveeta> coke from a can is definitely better than from a bottleâ€¦ same with mountain dewâ€¦ mountain dew from a can is probably my favorite soda, like, evar
[08:51:44] <poutine> Velveeta, wrong
[08:51:50] <poutine> mexican coke > HFCS coke
[08:52:00] <Velveeta> you do make an excellent point there
[08:52:00] <poutine> and mexican coke only comes in a bottle
[08:52:07] <BillCriswell> Yeah, Mexican Code is great.
[08:52:10] <BillCriswell> Coke*
[08:52:12] <Velveeta> so for the purposes of my point, i'll clarify it to say "plastic bottle" :D
[08:53:02] <poutine> also motorcycles > cars, vim > emacs, turtles > giraffes
[08:53:16] <poutine> just to get those arguments over with
[08:54:11] <BillCriswell> poutine: I'd like to dive into the last comparison. I think both of those animals suck equally.
[08:54:27] <BillCriswell> Unless it's a frightened giraffe!
[08:54:33] <poutine> BillCriswell, Everyone has opinions, it's just important that you understand yours are wrong
[08:54:41] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[08:55:03] <BillCriswell> http://forgifs.com/gallery/d/200370-1/Peacock-scares-baby-giraffe.gif
[08:56:02] <BillCriswell> I'm so glad most gifs loop forever.
[09:04:33] <TelFiRE> I'm confused, I call flexslider() with no issue, but it just doesn't do anything. :(
[09:04:57] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: Dammit Obama.
[09:05:01] <TelFiRE> lol
[09:05:03] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: Is there any errors?
[09:05:03] <Velveeta> http://bukk.it/alsohowiwritejavascripts.gif
[09:05:11] <TelFiRE> BillCriswell: nope, no js errors at all
[09:05:36] <Velveeta> and on that note, i have a 4 hour offsite "team building" event that i have to go pick up a keg for now
[09:05:40] <Velveeta> huzzah, work!
[09:05:49] <BillCriswell> Lucky!
[09:05:49] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta sounds like my company :)
[09:05:51] <BillCriswell> Enjoy!
[09:06:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah you guys and all your awesome companies. :(
[09:06:13] <Velveeta> i was hoping to get an octoberfest keg of some kind for it, but it's still a bit too early, so alaskan amber is a decent enough fallback
[09:06:13] <BillCriswell> What is it a keg of?
[09:06:29] <BillCriswell> Haven't had that.
[09:06:39] <Velveeta> they did have a sam adams octoberfest, which is not bad, but i opted out of it
[09:06:44] <Velveeta> you should give it a shot
[09:06:54] <Velveeta> also, blue moon makes a pumpkin ale this time of yearâ€¦ phenomenal
[09:07:12] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: Have it up live anywhere?
[09:07:16] <Velveeta> i'm not a fan of any of blue moon's other offerings, but their pumpkin ale is pretty awesome
[09:07:18] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Was never big on pumpkin beer.
[09:07:31] <TelFiRE> BillCriswell: http://dev.whywaitwebs.com/
[09:07:37] <Velveeta> bill: well, can't please em all ;)
[09:07:39] <Velveeta> adios, people
[09:07:50] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[09:07:55] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Later. Enjoy.
[09:08:11] <TelFiRE> BillCriswell: fwiw, I thought it might be an issue that the items I'm performing it on are hidden at first. but it won't even work if I do it in console
[09:08:12] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: Not sure where I should be looking?
[09:08:36] <TelFiRE> BillCriswell: if you open an item, the div that it shows you with multiple screenshots, that's what's supposed to be a slideshow. it's called from www.js
[09:09:00] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: Ahhhh.
[09:13:29] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: This plugin seems to want the HTML very specifically.
[09:13:51] <BillCriswell> I'd click the "Advanced" tab here http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ and read up!
[09:14:18] <BillCriswell> By default the selector looks for ".slides > li", there's no "slides" class in your HTML.
[09:14:25] <BillCriswell> But it's lunch time! Good luck!
[09:14:45] <TelFiRE> thanks BillCriswell I'll have a look
[09:15:15] <dweeb_> Is there another way to refer to an HTML node without using Xpath or CSS? Maybe like recursively counting all elements from top and give every element an index?
[09:15:44] <dweeb_> Or maybe all elements in the DOM already have an index?
[09:16:10] <duch_kazatel> dweeb_ bwuh what's the issue?
[09:18:17] <dweeb_> duch_kazatel: I have a given HTML body on the client side. Same HTML body is stored on the server side. I want the client to tell the server about a specific node without sending xpath/css. I rather send an ID.
[09:20:43] <duch_kazatel> wait what.
[09:20:45] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[09:22:39] <dweeb_> duch_kazatel: Why not?
[09:23:43] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand the question itself.  what're you actually trying to achieve?
[09:26:06] <dweeb_> duch_kazatel: Two apps have a copy of the same html snippet. One of the apps wants to tell the other about a node element without sending the xpath. How is that possible?
[09:26:43] <Thoams> with... the element id.
[09:26:50] <duch_kazatel> that first part sounds strange to me - two apps?
[09:26:52] <dweeb_> Thoams: there is no element id
[09:26:57] <Thoams> get one.
[09:27:08] <dweeb_> Thoams: not my html code
[09:27:22] <duch_kazatel> dweeb_ what's the actual use case here?
[09:27:51] <dweeb_> duch_kazatel: Why care about the app thing. How do I identify an HTML node without Xpath/CSS?
[09:28:36] <duch_kazatel> because you're saying "how do I do this the really hard way?"
[09:28:53] <duch_kazatel> when what I want to know is "why not see if there's an easier way you're not considering?"
[09:30:18] <dweeb_> duch_kazatel: Okay I see. You and I have the same HTML document. I would like to tell you about a node in the document. But is there a way to do that without telling your the xpath? :)
[09:30:44] <duch_kazatel> the idea that you can't use Xpath OR css-style selectors means you cannot do $('#lol'); OR $('div')[3];
[09:30:44] <duch_kazatel> and that still doesn't help.
[09:31:43] <duch_kazatel> "how can i do something without being able to use anything to do it?"
[09:32:58] <Thoams> http://jsfiddle.net/6n5zp/1/ find index of type of element
[09:33:02] <Thoams> e.g. div
[09:33:05] <Thoams> boom.
[09:33:06] <Thoams> next.
[09:55:20] <Ziber> I'm working with JQuery sortable and $.ajax() to save the re-ordered state of a few lists. I'm getting an ajax error, seemingly because it's empty data, but the data I'm sending isn't empty (and I've confirmed that with an alert()). To reproduce, reorder one of the list items in either list with devtools open. http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/
[09:56:47] <Ziber> The line it dies on is 8926 in jquery-1.9.1.js
[10:02:04] <shoky> Ziber: what ajax error?
[10:07:00] <Ziber> the JS dies, according to devtools, on this line: "xhr.send( ( s.hasContent && s.data ) || null );"
[10:07:49] <shoky> Ziber: nothing is dying for me
[10:07:59] <newman> I'm trying out Foundation's off-canvas examples and I want to use it for a restaurant menu. Each menu section's content will be displayed on the right and the tabbed-menu item navigation on the left. When I goto mobile everything works fine, but when I click the menu category and the sidebar appears, the content changes correctly, but the sidebar doesn't scroll back into the left. I have to re-click the reveal menu (or sidebar) butto
[10:08:03] <shoky> i get this in console:  Object {section: "item", query: "UPDATE drag_tables SET items='I1-1|I1-2', update_ts = '1379092072' WHERE id='L1'", debug: "query: UPDATE drag_tables SET items='I1-1|I1-2', update_ts = '1379092072' WHERE id='L1'â†µerror: ", output: "Received an update for L1 (I1-1|I1-2). Saved."}
[10:08:04] <Ziber> Really? o.o
[10:08:19] <Ziber> Refresh it. Do the items stay in the order you put them in?
[10:08:35] <newman> If you can assist me I'd greatly appreciate and even compensate.
[10:08:37] <shoky> ya
[10:08:42] * Ziber blinks
[10:08:54] <Ziber> Uhm. I'm confused then.
[10:09:36] <shoky> it doesn't work when reordering the 2 lists themselves
[10:09:44] <Ziber> I know. I'm working on that piece.
[10:09:52] <Ziber> But that's weird. Maybe it was a browser caching issue.
[10:09:55] <Ziber> Thanks though.
[10:10:00] <Pyche> Hi, can someone help with some code -  http://jsfiddle.net/zXYFc/1/  -- trying to get the selected value from drop down AND the data-id attribute for the dropdown. Issue is that I have many dropdowns all with same ID
[10:10:47] <duch_kazatel> Pyche you cannot use an ID more than once per page.
[10:10:47] <duch_kazatel> ever
[10:11:16] <duch_kazatel> without fixing that you're going to have problems.
[10:11:44] <Pyche> k, so I'd have to create a 'change' function for all, lets say, 50 drop downs?
[10:12:28] <duch_kazatel> no, you need to eliminate the IDs
[10:12:30] <duch_kazatel> first and foremost.
[10:12:37] <duch_kazatel> that's HTML101
[10:12:45] <duch_kazatel> without fixing that, you're going to have tons of problems.
[10:12:48] <duch_kazatel> fix that first.
[10:12:51] <Pyche> k
[10:13:19] <duch_kazatel> the better idea is to change the "id" attrib to a "Class".
[10:13:25] <duch_kazatel> and then ref them all that way instead.
[10:16:54] <BillCriswell> TelFiRE: How did it go?
[10:17:22] <TelFiRE> BillCriswell: Yeah it was just the lack of a "slides" class, after that I had to initialize on the click instead of load but no other issues
[10:17:32] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[10:17:43] <TelFiRE> just working on styling now that it's working
[10:17:50] <TelFiRE> thanks for your help :)
[10:18:17] <newman> Can someone tell me if it's possible at ( http://nolabyg.com/offcanvas/ ), when the screen is in mobile view, and you click "Menu Item", the sidebar appears, and the tabs change the content properly. I just want the tabs to re-hide the sidebar on click. Is that possible?
[10:18:49] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:18:52] <newman> The only way now to re-hide the sidebar is to click the same button.
[10:19:12] <Ziber> shoky: All working now :)
[10:21:23] <rgr> whats the proper way to order the elements in an each() loop? Ideally I'd to iterate the set ordered on a data-orderby attribute of the elements.
[10:23:26] <duch_kazatel> rgr are you spitting them out to somewhere else to have them ordered specifically?
[10:24:49] <rgr> no, id just like the each to iterate in a set order.
[10:25:39] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to build your own logic to handle that.
[10:26:34] <rgr> (based on an element attribute)
[10:28:20] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[10:31:53] <jop008> I have this alert ( $("#title")[0].outerHTML );   $("#title").html ("test");   alert ( $("#title")[0].outerHTML ); the alerts are displaying the correct values but the screen is not updated accordingly
[10:32:03] <jop008> what can be the cause?
[10:32:28] <jop008> The screen shows xxx as value and stays the same the string test is not displayed
[10:34:24] <BillCriswell> rgr: http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/ could help.
[10:34:39] <BillCriswell> Ah, gone.
[10:36:12] <ftj> I have an odd little problem. (For once) instead of jumping through CSS hoops to flush my footer to the bottom when the page's content isn't long enough, I've decided to do it in JS. (It's in a backend panel only a few people will use anyway.)
[10:37:32] <ftj> My problem is that when (document).ready fires and I check to see if the content is taller than the window, my content is reporting that it's shorter than it is. If I do a timer and check the same element a few seconds later, its height() is the correct height. Any ideas?
[10:37:41] <ftj> I thought document.ready only fired when everything was done loading.
[10:38:18] <ftj> Code's here: https://gist.github.com/franktisellano/45a246563e1df5324d23
[10:39:02] <BillCriswell> ftj: If there's images you need to wait for them to load, or give them a height.
[10:39:21] <ftj> BillCriswell: Ah, got it. Yes. There are images on that page. That makes sense.
[10:40:08] <BillCriswell> ftj: Yeah, (document).ready() just lets you know when it can be manipulated, not that everything is loaded.
[10:40:51] <BillCriswell> You can replace .ready() with .load() and that should clear it up
[10:41:04] <ftj> Beautiful. Thanks
[10:41:21] <jop008> any reson why this is not working $("#title").html ("test") ?
[10:41:40] <jedimind> you have a space between html and (
[10:41:43] <jop008> test is not on the screen the old value stays there in stad
[10:42:03] <ftj> jop008: Should be $("#title").html("test");
[10:42:05] <jop008> the html it self works as expected
[10:42:14] <BillCriswell> No problem ftj.
[10:42:20] <jop008> since the value is updated
[10:43:38] <jop008> the space makes no difference
[10:44:16] <danissa> hello
[10:44:22] <jop008> maybe the title name is not possible
[10:44:29] <BillCriswell> jop008: You need to make sure the element is available for jquery to update it.
[10:44:46] <jop008> how do you make it available?
[10:44:51] <danissa> can anyone help me with a problem ? I have a hash in my urls :) can someone look at my code from style.css if i upload somewere ?
[10:45:14] <BillCriswell> If your code is in the <head> wrap it in $(function(){ ... }); or if it's before </body> it should be cool, just asusming it's in the header.
[10:45:55] <ftj> BillCriswell: I think I thanked you too soon. $(document).load doesn't appear to be firing
[10:46:01] <ftj> BillCriswell ;)
[10:46:40] <BillCriswell> ftj: Haha. Hmm...
[10:47:05] <ftj> BillCriswell: I'll try adding heights to the images first
[10:47:17] <jop008> I rry to update it within document ready function
[10:47:20] <danissa> please ? :)
[10:47:35] <BillCriswell> ftj: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/544993/official-way-to-ask-jquery-wait-for-all-images-to-load-before-executing-somethin says I should be right. Might be something else going on.
[10:47:45] <BillCriswell> jop008: What's rry?
[10:47:54] <jop008> try
[10:48:09] <BillCriswell> Oh, got it, don't know why I couldn't peice that together.
[10:48:10] <ftj> BillCriswell: Ah, $(window).load. I was using $(document).load
[10:48:30] <BillCriswell> ftj: I should have clarified. My bad.
[10:48:32] <ElysiumNet> I can't believe I still don't know how to use inheritance in javascript...
[10:48:39] <BillCriswell> I did say to "just replace" it.
[10:48:46] <BillCriswell> Just a bad call. haha
[10:48:53] <ftj> BillCriswell: All good. Working great. IDIOT :P
[10:48:57] <BillCriswell> Hahaha.
[10:49:47] <danissa> BillCriswell do you have 2 minutes for me please ? :D
[10:51:33] <BillCriswell> danissa: Your question was a bit weird for my liking to be honest.
[10:51:39] <jop008> I put in $(function and the alert is howing test $("#title").trigger ("create");     alert ( $("#title").html() ); but on screen it stays with the old value
[10:52:03] <ftj> jop008: Can you post a gist with your code?
[10:52:25] <Scott0_> can anyone recommend a siolution for a counter like the one on gmail?
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> jop008: Do you have a create event?
[10:53:15] <jop008> yes
[10:53:21] <jop008> after the update
[10:53:30] <jop008> makes no difference
[10:53:39] <NoiseEee> jop008: how many times will you be linked to http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 before you read it?
[10:53:44] <NoiseEee> jop008: just kinda wondering ya know
[10:54:00] <ftj> Scott0_: Which counter in gmail?
[10:54:01] <NoiseEee> jop008: cuz you're still using "alert()" to debug, and your problem is easily solvable if you learned to debug
[10:54:25] <Scott0_> ftj: the one that shows disk space
[10:54:44] <Scott0_> did they get rid of that?
[10:54:52] <ftj> Scott0_ Do you mean on the login screen?
[10:54:59] <Scott0_> yeah
[10:55:21] <danissa> well..
[10:55:25] <jop008> shit the fiddle works as expected http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/20/
[10:55:26] <ftj> Ah ok. That's gone now. What did it do?
[10:55:40] <danissa> a #! appears betwen url/index.html and the other page
[10:55:54] <danissa> example site/index.html#!page2.html
[10:56:00] <Scott0_> im guessing they provided it with current space, then provided a per second increment for it to count up with
[10:56:02] <danissa> i only want to open site/page2.html
[10:56:45] <ftj> Scott0_ Was it doing any fancy animation or just incrementing the number?
[10:56:51] <Scott0_> incrementing
[10:57:01] <Scott0_> I need indefinite incrementing
[10:57:05] <ftj> Scott0_ One sec.
[10:57:14] <Scott0_> most of what im finding does count up to
[10:57:42] <BillCriswell> danissa: If your links are doing that I'm assuming you're using some kind of like... ajax framework?
[10:58:02] <Scott0_> ftj: I assume it can't be that hard :P
[10:58:12] <Scott0_> ftj: just didn't want to recreate
[10:58:58] <ftj> Scott0_: http://jsfiddle.net
[10:58:59] <ftj> Oops
[10:59:07] <ftj> Scott0_: http://jsfiddle.net/franktisellano/CYsJd/
[10:59:08] <Scott0_> im guessing it could be done by incrementing and then pausing
[10:59:28] <denysonique> How can I unbind an entire event namespace in jQuery from every element in the document?
[10:59:50] <danissa> BillCriswell can you take a look please ? I am allowed to paste my link here ? :)
[11:00:04] <denysonique> $('*').off('.namespace') //=> Ranger Error, call stack size exceeded.
[11:00:04] <BillCriswell> danissa: Sure thing, just a link is fune.
[11:00:07] <BillCriswell> fine*
[11:00:30] <danissa> www.dj-arad.ro
[11:00:40] <Scott0_> ftj: how often dos that update?
[11:00:53] <dualcore> is it $('*') or $(*)
[11:00:53] <Scott0_> 1000ms?
[11:00:56] <ftj> Scott0_: See where it says "var interval = 1000"?
[11:01:01] <ftj> Scott0_: yeah, exactly
[11:01:02] <dualcore> idk
[11:01:17] <denysonique> dualcore: $('*')
[11:01:27] <ftj> Scott0_: So if you change that to 50, it'll be flying. It'll update 20 times a second.
[11:01:28] <danissa> after you hit enter, you will reach the index.html If you click "Galerie" button you should get the dj-arad.ro/portfolio.html link like i seted in index.html href line
[11:01:34] <Scott0_> ftj: I thought it wouldn't be hard :P
[11:01:40] <danissa> But as you can see i get something else :(
[11:01:43] <ftj> Scott0_: mhmm :)
[11:01:51] <Scott0_> thanmks
[11:02:06] <ftj> Scott0_ np
[11:04:29] <jop008> found two times code run wrong include statements
[11:04:31] <jop008> thx
[11:04:40] <danissa518> Hi. can anyone help me with a hash that appears in my urls ? :(
[11:05:19] <BillCriswell> danissa518: It looks like you could just add a class of "igore-ajax" to the link you don't want all that shit happeniing with.
[11:05:52] <danissa518> were can i add this igore-ajax line ?
[11:06:25] <BillCriswell> In the html to #nav if you want all the nav links to not do that or an a tag with it.
[11:06:58] <danissa> i just want this setting for my portfolio page
[11:07:38] <denysonique> Right
[11:08:14] <denysonique> It is preffered to $(document).on('selector', event, cback), instead of $('selector').click(cback)
[11:08:16] <denysonique> Isn't it?
[11:08:44] <NoiseEee> depends
[11:09:10] <NoiseEee> if you have many elements of 'selector', and especially ones being added after initial load, then yes
[11:09:31] <danissa> BillCriswell can you please tell me what line to replace please ? http://hostcode.sourceforge.net/view/1004

[11:09:42] <danissa> Here is my index.html nav code.
[11:10:10] <BillCriswell> Try to replace <a href="http://www.dj-arad.ro/portfolio.html"> with <a class="ignore-ajax" href="http://www.dj-arad.ro/portfolio.html">
[11:10:29] <danissa> Thank you very much for your patience with me :)
[11:10:56] <BillCriswell> All good.
[11:11:06] <NoiseEee> denysonique: arent you missing a param there?
[11:11:46] <denysonique> NoiseEee: which one?
[11:11:56] <denysonique> NoiseEee: also it is $('*') that gives the Range Error
[11:11:57] <NoiseEee> denysonique: the event for 'off'
[11:12:12] <denysonique> I guess $('*') is quite intensive anyway
[11:12:23] <NoiseEee> denysonique: well i'm not sure how many valid use cases there are for $('*') ?
[11:12:57] <danissa> BillCriswell that works !!
[11:13:04] <danissa> Thank you very much :)
[11:13:10] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:13:36] <denysonique> NoiseEee: unbinding all events
[11:13:51] <denysonique> anyway, $('*') causes a CPU spike
[11:13:57] <NoiseEee> obviously!
[11:14:05] <denysonique> I iwll stick to $(document).on.off
[11:14:09] <denysonique> on and off*
[11:14:25] <denysonique> NoiseEee: basically I have a reload button on my browser plugin
[11:14:45] <denysonique> of which I reload the JS dynamically in order to avoid full browser refreshes
[11:14:54] <NoiseEee> i see.
[11:14:55] <denysonique> hence the need to unbind all events every time
[11:15:23] <denysonique> (the fastest way for userscript/extension development)
[11:15:42] <denysonique> "aka in process code reloading" ;>
[11:23:00] <linrunix> Are nulls counted in the length of an object?
[11:23:52] <linrunix> as in Object.length
[11:24:00] <linrunix> will the null values be counted?
[11:24:54] <BillCriswell> linrunix: I think length only works on strings and arrays?
[11:25:18] <BillCriswell> Wait..
[11:25:26] <linrunix> :S ?
[11:25:44] <linrunix> And object with key: value (objects) inside
[11:25:47] <linrunix> has a length
[11:26:06] <linrunix> now when you delete one of those key: value objects you are left with a null in its place
[11:26:19] <linrunix> when using length it's counting those nulls :/
[11:26:44] <BillCriswell> linrunix: var foo = { name: "Bill", channels: "jQuery" }; foo.length returns undefined.
[11:27:55] <linrunix> print foo in the console in the browser
[11:28:05] <linrunix> and see what length it gives you BillCriswell
[11:29:06] <NoiseEee> linrunix: objects don't have a length property.
[11:30:27] <linrunix> NoiseEee: then maybe what I have is an array of objects
[11:30:43] <linrunix> which means I can splice the object instead of delete and I won't be left with a null
[11:30:45] <linrunix> ;D
[11:30:49] <linrunix> Let me try that
[11:40:17] <OHNERO> Does anyone know of a way to play vimeo videos back to back? I am wanting to create an intro video on my website and then have it play a second video with no delay?
[11:41:32] <BillCriswell> OHNERO: I'd start here: http://developer.vimeo.com/
[11:41:41] <OHNERO> Im looking here right now: http://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api#universal-with-froogaloop
[11:46:24] <alexfu> how would it be possible for a handler to not be triggered on a load event of an image, but the image still loads perfectly.
[11:47:02] <OHNERO> paste your code
[11:47:11] <logix812> is it common when setting up qunit based tests to create multiple pages for different sections to be tested?
[11:50:24] <Xal_> What does it mean when I get the error "$(...).ready is not a function"?
[11:50:38] <alexfu> OHNERO, http://pastebin.com/nXkYPxgk
[11:50:46] <Kambfhase> Xal_: that means $ is not jQuery
[11:50:48] <Xal_> The page is calling the jquery library in correctly
[11:50:57] <OHNERO> Xal_: Try using jQuery instead of $
[11:51:08] <Kambfhase> Xal_: maybe something called $.noConflict()?
[11:51:15] <OHNERO> You need to include jQuery before your custom script
[11:51:25] <OHNERO> $.noConflict() might work as well.
[11:51:52] <alexfu> OHNERO, handler gets triggered sometimes...
[11:52:11] <OHNERO> Do you have a live link?
[11:52:20] <alexfu> live link?
[11:52:29] <alexfu> no
[11:52:30] <OHNERO> Are you working live or locally?
[11:52:33] <OHNERO> okay
[11:52:40] <Scott0_> any reason why the decimals don't count up? http://jsfiddle.net/CYsJd/1/
[11:52:43] <OHNERO> That should be working
[11:52:57] <OHNERO> Maybe because your creating the img on the fly?
[11:53:01] <alexfu> OHNERO, it works fine in Chrome & firefox.. IE7 is where this issue is coming up
[11:53:10] <OHNERO> Oh I'm not sure then..
[11:53:39] <OHNERO> Instead of using document.createElement('img') try using $('<img>')
[11:53:46] <Scott0_> nm, parseInt probably
[11:54:03] <alexfu> OHNERO, i'll try that
[11:54:13] <Xal_> jquery IS being called in before anything else.
[11:54:29] <OHNERO> Your merging raw js with jquery and old browsers don't work well with raw js
[11:54:37] <OHNERO> so try to write jQuery as much as you can
[11:55:20] <TelFiRE> Anyone ever used jQuery App Folders? I'd like to prevent the clicking of a folder causing the page to jump to top, it makes the thing feel very jumpy and buggy
[11:55:58] <alexfu> OHNERO, didn't resolve anything
[11:56:03] <Scott0_> is there somethnig more recent like this ? http://cnanney.com/journal/code/apple-style-counter/
[11:56:08] <OHNERO> Im not sure than, sorry :/
[11:56:13] <OHNERO> :(
[11:57:44] <alexfu> darn
[11:57:47] <alexfu> thx anyway
[12:07:23] <benlieb> is there a standard solution for a display toggle button that you can feed what text (or html) to show on display:none / display:block?
[12:07:34] <benlieb> Or do I have to roll my own every time?
[12:08:52] <Kambfhase> Just create an abstraction yourself
[12:10:21] <Kambfhase> Scott0_: never use parseint without a second parameter
[12:12:41] <paultag> Anyone know how to load YAML (something like getYAML would be key)
[12:14:52] <grafi> oO
[12:14:57] <BillCriswell> paultag: Like... YAML to json?
[12:15:29] <paultag> Uh, sorta. I don't want JSON, since I don't care about notation, I want a parsed dict / list / strings / ints
[12:15:36] <_rgn> probably like yaml to object
[12:15:53] <paultag> I don't control the datafile, so I can't switch it to JSON.
[12:16:09] <BillCriswell> paultag: I meant an object. Sorry about that.
[12:16:13] <paultag> No worries!
[12:18:28] <Krausen> quick question here:  I just got dropped into doing client-side development and am pretty much a newbie when it comes to html5/css3/javascript altogether.  I attended jQuery Austin and realized just how clueless I am.  Any recommended starting points for a sysadmin/dba type jumping into modern client-side development?
[12:19:39] <paultag> (if there's nothing, that's OK, I just want to make sure there's nothing in jQuery that can do this)
[12:20:06] <benlieb> how do I select the next sibling?

[13:24:30] <jfenix> Hi to everyone
[13:27:33] <linrunix> NoiseEee: BillCriswell thanks guys
[13:27:45] <linrunix> I was super confused and pretty dumb.
[13:27:47] <NoiseEee> linrunix: np
[13:27:48] <BillCriswell> Glad to be of assistance.
[13:28:00] <linrunix> I had objects inside an array :S
[13:28:05] <linrunix> no wonder I had length.
[13:31:39] <pgvoorhees> Stupid newbie question, could someone help me interpret this code: $('#someID').post(0).submit(); ?
[13:32:25] <duch_kazatel> target #someID, add some data for the post, and then submit it.
[13:32:28] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:32:44] <ppppp> pgvoorhees: consider taking a code academy class
[13:32:54] <ppppp> or tuts+ or whatev
[13:33:18] <pgvoorhees> Well, i've got a jquery hook on the submit function, and I'm curious why this code breaks an infinite loop of submits.
[13:33:19] <BillCriswell> linrunix: Haha that's why I was so confused.
[13:33:50] <ppppp> where is this code?
[13:33:52] <pgvoorhees> if you were to do $('#someID').submit(); it infinite loops.
[13:34:01] <ppppp> just in a <script> tag? if so it'll run on page load
[13:34:11] <pgvoorhees> for some reason that isn't clear to me, the post(0) unhooks the jquery hook.
[13:34:11] <ppppp> yeah
[13:34:22] <ppppp> unhooks?
[13:34:40] <raj> how do I get onstatechange and onanchorchange to never fire at the same time?
[13:35:08] <pgvoorhees> ppppp: mind if I pm?
[13:35:15] <pgvoorhees> no reason to pollute the channel
[13:35:31] <ppppp> nah, I won't be able to help you privately
[13:35:51] <ppppp> you need an intro to jquery
[13:36:06] <KWhat_Work> is there a good way to get the calculated hight of a "menu" item?  I am trying something like menu.find('li:first').outerHeight(), however that seems to return 2, which is far to small.
[13:36:16] <linrunix> BillCriswell: I'm sorry I confused you. I had a locache... || []
[13:36:25] <linrunix> that was creating the array without me noticing :/
[13:36:33] <BillCriswell> Ah, understood.
[13:36:49] <grafi> so what does .post(0) do oÃ´
[13:37:07] <hexacode> hey you guys i have a carousel list. theres css applied to :first  and :last elements of the list through an external css file. is there any way that if i dynamically ajax load new elements into the first and last position, for these new elements to get the css applied to them? and to have the previous elements that were first and last, drop the rules applied to them when they are no longer first and last
[13:37:21] <BillCriswell> requests the url "0" maybe? haha
[13:37:30] <pgvoorhees> beats me
[13:37:48] <pgvoorhees> it's how stripe interrupts their creditcard token retrieval loop
[13:38:25] <grafi> interesting
[13:38:49] <duch_kazatel> hexacode uhhh, :first and :last should apply the the first and last elements, even if you add/remove.
[13:38:50] <pgvoorhees> Full code snipped it here: https://stripe.com/docs/tutorials/forms
[13:39:42] <pgvoorhees> read the API manual, and it didn't seem like '0' was a valid parameter to pass get/post.
[13:40:29] <grafi> no post(0) there ?!
[13:41:02] <pgvoorhees> it's get() in that case.
[13:41:22] <codecry> Having a bit of trouble interpreting what to do with the getter and setter code samples in http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[13:42:04] <grafi> pgvoorhees get could be this one though http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:42:20] <grafi> instead of the ajax shorthand
[13:43:00] <grafi> We call submit() on the form directly, rather than the jQuery wrapper, so that we don't run into an infinite loop.
[13:43:01] <pgvoorhees> grafi: Yeah, I think you're right there.
[13:43:02] <grafi> see
[13:43:31] <pgvoorhees> I thougth it was modifying the communication behavior of the form
[13:43:36] <grafi> but I dont see that explanation for .post(0)
[13:43:40] <pgvoorhees> not changing which object it was applying the function
[13:44:02] <pgvoorhees> there is a post() doc in one of the other sections
[13:44:21] <grafi> have a link?
[13:44:25] <pgvoorhees> I was misunderstanding the whole context; noob question
[13:44:35] <HarryPitfall> but... .get(numeric index) on a jquery selector just return the html node at that position...
[13:44:39] <pgvoorhees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:45:01] <HarryPitfall> the raw object... .eq(index) return the node wrapper in another jquery object
[13:45:01] <grafi> thats not stripe though^^
[13:45:18] <pgvoorhees> grafi: true
[13:45:25] <HarryPitfall> wrapped
[13:45:32] <grafi> so wheres the .post(0) comming from?
[13:45:41] <pgvoorhees> made up
[13:45:42] <pgvoorhees> haha
[13:45:44] <grafi> ah
[13:45:46] <grafi> I see
[13:45:47] <grafi> :D
[13:46:08] <grafi> well its a little unfortunate that both have the same names
[13:46:10] <raj> do I need history.adapter.jquery.js? https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/tree/master/scripts/uncompressed ... I used to just use history.js file alone without an adapter. What does the adapter do?
[13:46:34] <pgvoorhees> again, I thoguht the get() was modifying the form submition mechanism. I didn't realize that it could have an alternate purpose.
[13:46:43] <grafi> yeah
[13:46:43] <pgvoorhees> but, I'm not jquery anything.
[13:46:50] <grafi> :)
[13:47:02] <Kambfhase> i use the brackets instead of .get(i)
[13:47:24] <grafi> Kambfhase is a vim user

[14:00:03] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:00:46] <duch_kazatel> raj ugh history.js
[14:01:00] <duch_kazatel> but the adaptors are for integration with frameworks.
[14:01:25] <Kambfhase> Now: DÃ¶ner.
[14:02:39] <raj> duch_kazatel, is that a new thing?
[14:02:49] <raj> because I don't currently have any adapter and it works
[14:03:00] <grafi> yumm @ Kambfhase
[14:03:01] <raj> what's the adapter for anyway?
[14:03:07] <raj> what needs to integrate with jquery?

[14:05:34] <boytoy_> I'm working on this dynamic link list -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/1/ -- but currently the showing of bullets according to hoverIntent is messed up. The code is also reasonably bloated / retarded. Should I keep trying or start from scratch?
[14:05:49] <boytoy_> * http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/2/
[14:06:36] <raj> duch can we discuss this?
[14:08:02] <duch_kazatel> sorry was away for a sec.
[14:08:14] <duch_kazatel> some people prefer accessing it as a jquery method.
[14:08:21] <duch_kazatel> I'm personally not a fan of history.js anyway.
[14:08:21] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[14:09:38] <duch_kazatel> raj it's all about preference.  it works without the adaptors just fine either way
[14:09:44] <duch_kazatel> it's all about personal taste imo.
[14:09:55] <raj> duch_kazatel, how might I use an adapter?
[14:10:06] <duch_kazatel> raj uh what do you mean?
[14:10:08] <raj> , the jquery one to be specific
[14:11:21] <raj> duch_kazatel, if I don't have the adapter, I use `History.getState()` for example. If I use the adapter, what would I instead write?
[14:11:55] <duch_kazatel> i dunno i didn't use the adapter when i tried to use it.
[14:12:21] <duch_kazatel> i all ready told you i don't like history.js - i tried to work with it and gave up to write my own history management.
[14:12:48] <raj> duch_kazatel, are you serious? That's a crazy endeavor
[14:12:54] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[14:12:59] <raj> I can't believe you managed to pull that off
[14:13:29] <duch_kazatel> All history.pushstate does is make things more consistent for you and provide a fallback for old browsers.
[14:13:32] <duch_kazatel> i didn't need the fallback.
[14:13:42] <HD|Lapto1> Hey
[14:13:47] <duch_kazatel> and the only consistency issue I had was between Chrome and Firefox.
[14:13:48] <duch_kazatel> it S EASYT.
[14:13:51] <duch_kazatel> *it was easy
[14:14:15] <HD|Lapto1> I've got a strange scrollTop() behaviour on http://dtmp.vm-dg.de/rss/#feed/64/
[14:14:57] <HD|Lapto1> when switching between feeds (and having scrolled in the feed list before the switch), then, despite calling $("#feedentries").scrollTop(0);, the feedlist does not scroll
[14:15:25] <HD|Lapto1> I have rgrep'd the whole codebase for scrollTop(value) calls but I could not find any except the explicit scrollTop(0)
[14:16:09] <raj> duch_kazatel, so how can I load a page `www.mysite.com/raj#side` and not trigger both window.onstatechange and window.onanchorchange?
[14:16:14] <HD|Lapto1> when running loadFeed(1); in the console, then it even says that scrollTop() returned 0
[14:16:37] <HD|Lapto1> but when I explicitly check $("#feedentries").scrollTop() I get e.g. 100 or whatever back
[14:16:40] <HD|Lapto1> why?!
[14:17:21] <duch_kazatel> raj what's the real problem you're trying to solve?
[14:17:29] <duch_kazatel> why are you using hashes?
[14:19:07] <BillCriswell> Later guys.
[14:20:03] <duckgoose> hello #jQuery

[14:24:17] <TelFiRE> I have some slideshows which exist in a div that is hidden when the page loads. So, I initialize the slideshow when someone clicks the item which causes them to show. This works well except for one problem. If they click one, then click another, then resize the window, then go back to the one they originally clicked, it looks crappy because it still holds the dimensions of when it was originally initialized. This slideshow can't simpl
[14:24:18] <TelFiRE> re-initialized easily. Any ideas?
[14:24:21] <grafi> $$$$
[14:24:32] <Scott0_> anyone know what font this is? http://demo.cnanney.com/apple-counter-revisited/
[14:26:50] <duch_kazatel> "It uses the @font-face font kit BD Cartoon Shout from Font Squirrel. As usual, code is commented if you're curious. Here is everything for the countdown in a zip file."
[14:26:50] <duch_kazatel> http://cnanney.com/journal/code/apple-style-counter/
[14:33:40] <Scott0_> duch_kazatel: have you ever seen the BD cartoon font? I doubt that's the one that's used
[14:33:57] <duch_kazatel> I literally just copy/pasted what was on the site.
[14:34:00] <Scott0_> http://www.dafont.com/bd-cartoon-shout.font
[14:34:02] <Scott0_> I know
[14:34:04] <duch_kazatel> didn't really do much more than that ;)
[14:34:10] <Scott0_> but if that's what I was looking for, I wouldn't have asked
[14:34:14] <Scott0_> I can read :D
[14:35:09] <TelFiRE> Is there a bit of jQuery that can basically say, "re-apply css to browser"? The same as if I were to resize my browser one pixel and then back, basically?
[14:35:35] <duch_kazatel> TelFiRE you shouldn't need to do that.
[14:35:51] <duch_kazatel> and Scott0_ kay - a lot of folks don't do that, hence my terseness ;)
[14:36:08] <Scott0_> duch_kazatel: no faith.. :(
[14:36:23] <TelFiRE> duch_kazatel: My issue is that I have a hidden element. If I first resize, then show it, it's fine. But if I show it, then hide it, then resizeâ€¦ I show it again and it's using the old media queries from before the resize
[14:38:25] <TelFiRE> if I resize again while it's showing, it fixes it
[14:38:45] <TelFiRE> So it leads me to believe that for whatever reason, if an item has been shown, then hidden again, it's not getting the new css applied when a media query kicks in
[14:39:48] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like you need to clean up your media queries imo..
[14:39:53] <duch_kazatel> but that't just me lol
[14:40:29] <TelFiRE> I'm not sure what you mean
[14:40:54] <TelFiRE> It's pretty clean, there's not a lot going on at all.
[14:41:29] <TelFiRE> Simply the media queries are not applying, at all, to the hidden object. They work fine if it's showing.
[14:42:05] <duch_kazatel> without seeing a sample, it's hard to say, but the desired fix sounds like a hacky workaround to another problem.
[14:42:08] <duch_kazatel> but like I said, that's just me.
[14:42:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm sure somebody else has a solution.
[14:42:50] <torbjorn> can I dynamically add elements to a jquery ui menu? it seems to initialize from html, but has no add_element method
[14:43:07] <torbjorn> or perhaps just add the html with jquery, and call .menu() again?
[14:44:08] <TelFiRE> Ok, well the site is here if anyone cares to take a look. http://dev.whywaitwebs.com/ I kind of agree that this is a workaround rather than a fix and would prefer a fix, but also don't think that would present many problemsâ€¦ I only have like 8 lines of js besides libraries as it is, so..yeah
[14:52:37] <raj> duch_kazatel, I have hashes to select which tab was selected, and then it renders the tab-panel accordingly
[14:53:25] <raj> tab click --> url's hashchange --> urldispatch function --> alteration of DOM
[14:55:03] <KWhat_Work> Is firefox buggy with top locations?  I am getting 1px bug between firefox and chrome
[14:55:32] <KWhat_Work> widget.top + a constant is different on firefox and chrome
[14:58:25] <ech0s7> why this code doesn't set onclick event on div ?
[14:58:41] <Kambfhase_> which code?
[14:58:54] <Kambfhase_> ?p @ ech0s7
[14:58:55] <bot-t> ech0s7, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:59:08] <ech0s7> var box = "<div>….<div>"; $(box).click(function() {});
[15:00:10] <Kambfhase_> well, technically that code does set an event handler, but you never get to see it.
[15:01:23] <Kambfhase_> try `var box = "<div>Â….<div>", $box = $(box);` and then `$box.click(function(){})`
[15:03:04] <ech0s7> Kambfhase_: it's the same
[15:03:07] <ech0s7> doesn't works
[15:03:59] <Kambfhase_> why do you do with the box afterwards?
[15:05:09] <boytoy_> hi torbjorn
[15:05:14] <boytoy_> long time brother, long time!
[15:05:30] <ech0s7> Kambfhase_: because i create div dynamically...
[15:05:35] <ech0s7> parsing an xml
[15:05:41] <Kambfhase_> and then?
[15:05:55] <boytoy_> whats an experienced dev like you doing in here asking questions like that though
[15:06:06] <ech0s7> and then i would set different onclick event for each div
[15:06:59] <Kambfhase_> ech0s7: can you please paste more of xyour code, so I can see whats going on?
[15:07:31] <ech0s7> ok course
[15:08:14] <ech0s7> Kambfhase_: http://fixee.org/paste/vyw5v5u/
[15:08:24] <Kambfhase_> will look
[15:08:58] <Kambfhase_> ah, yeah. Thats not going to work
[15:09:19] <grafi> obv
[15:09:20] <grafi> :P
[15:09:45] <Kambfhase_> Everytime you paste the string `box` into $(box) a NEW object is created
[15:10:56] <ech0s7> Kambfhase_: how fix ?
[15:11:00] <Kambfhase_> Try this: http://fixee.org/paste/vyw5v5u/#url=p3576gv
[15:12:52] <ech0s7> yes this seems more logic
[15:12:57] <ech0s7> and works
[15:13:19] <ech0s7> but it's ugly to look  this code
[15:13:20] <ech0s7> :)
[15:13:49] <boytoy_> Hi, I'm trying to make this dynamic link list w/ progressive disclosure -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/2/ -- but I can't get it to show the bullets properly on hover. I'm also worried I'm making it way harder than it has to be. Anybody have any advice?
[15:14:15] <Kambfhase_> Do you want me to make it more beautiful?
[15:15:03] <ech0s7> I did not ask this, but if you want
[15:15:06] <ech0s7> :)
[15:15:37] <Kambfhase_> I can try
[15:19:51] <ech0s7> ok Kambfhase_
[15:20:24] <Kambfhase_> have fun with this: http://fixee.org/paste/vyw5v5u/#url=jbhowxu
[15:24:47] <hexacode> hey you guys what type of easing strings does jquery accept. i googled it but didnt find results
[15:32:07] <raj> mr. duch_kazatel ?
[15:35:50] <duch_kazatel> sorry i was away.
[15:35:54] <duch_kazatel> what's up raj?
[15:39:01] <raj> you had asked for the actual issue I was encountering
[15:39:14] <raj> I have hashes to select which tab was selected, and then it renders the tab-panel accordingly
[15:39:18] <raj> tab click --> url's hashchange --> urldispatch function --> alteration of DOM
[15:41:31] <duch_kazatel> raj ok?  do you need to actually update the history of the browser for that?
[15:41:50] <raj> yes, I want to be able to go back to the previous tab with the back button
[15:42:09] <duch_kazatel> and you care about IE 9 and below?
[15:42:13] <duch_kazatel> because in that case, good luck.
[15:42:23] <duch_kazatel> history.js doesn't actually provide that ability for those browsers.
[15:42:36] <raj> IE9 doesn't haveit either?
[15:43:14] <duch_kazatel> IE9 and below don't support pushstates at all, even with history.js.
[15:43:29] <duch_kazatel> so you cannot get that functionality at all.
[15:47:55] <raj> duch_kazatel, do most people just ignore that fact?
[15:50:02] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[15:50:26] <raj> do most people just ignore the fact that the back button will be broken in IE?
[15:50:56] <duch_kazatel> raj err, what else would they do?
[15:51:07] <raj> lol, ok
[15:51:20] <duch_kazatel> there is no back pushstate support in IE 9 and below, so...
[15:51:23] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you're getting at.
[15:51:25] <raj> so what might I do for the flow I described?
[15:52:03] <duch_kazatel> what, for selecting a tab and having the URL update accordingly?
[15:52:10] <duch_kazatel> and maintaining back button support?
[15:52:28] <duch_kazatel> the biggest question is why in the world you want back button support in the first place.
[15:54:08] <raj> duch_kazatel, because the expected result from the back button is to go back to the previous tab
[15:54:55] <duch_kazatel> and that's where this falls apart - unless you're giving some other indication to the end user that tab is somehow a separate context entirely, that's a really bad assumption.
[15:55:24] <raj> the fact that the content of the page changes due to the tabs
[15:55:43] <duch_kazatel> why isn't it a separate page entirely then?
[15:55:53] <raj> because it's related
[15:55:57] <krenner> hi there. someone used jquery-ui and jointjs together? It looks like jquery-ui functions like .tabs() aren't working when i include jointjs script file
[15:56:18] <duch_kazatel> go read up on pushstate, popstate, and replacestate
[15:56:23] <raj> I did
[15:56:25] <raj> A LOT
[15:56:33] <duch_kazatel> what didn't you understand then?
[15:56:40] <duch_kazatel> ooooh
[15:56:51] <duch_kazatel> your issue is when the user presses back, nothing happens?
[15:57:18] <duch_kazatel> like, it doesn't change tab?
[15:57:26] <raj> no
[15:57:39] <duch_kazatel> then what's the issue?
[15:58:07] <duch_kazatel> the "best way" to do it is to set a query string parameter saying something like tab=infoOrWhatever.
[15:58:07] <raj> my current issue is that when `www.mysite.com/raj#side` is visited, then `window.onstatechange` as well as `window.onanchorchange` are run
[15:58:19] <duch_kazatel> don't use the hash...
[15:58:23] <raj> so query string instead of hash
[15:58:24] <duch_kazatel> use a QSP
[15:58:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah....
[15:58:45] <duch_kazatel> OR do #tab=side
[15:58:49] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[15:58:59] <raj> that's still a hash though
[15:58:59] <raj> no?
[15:59:28] <duch_kazatel> why does it matter if those methods run?
[15:59:35] <duch_kazatel> are you binding to them elsehwere?
[16:00:10] <raj> ya
[16:00:21] <raj> window.onstatechange = urlDispatch;
[16:00:30] <raj> from urlDispatch, I decide what to do
[16:00:35] <raj> with the URL
[16:00:43] <raj> and delegate rendering of the page to different functions
[16:00:57] <duch_kazatel> "delegate rendering of the page to different functions"
[16:01:00] <duch_kazatel> that sounds terrifying
[16:01:03] <raj> why?
[16:01:19] <duch_kazatel> are you relying on javascript for most of your page rendering?
[16:02:00] <raj> so if www.mysite.com/news is visited or www.mysite.com/blog is visited, I would run renderPageNews() and renderPageBlog(), respectively
[16:02:16] <duch_kazatel> and this is client-side javascript?
[16:02:22] <grafi> ....
[16:02:25] <raj> no, I retrieve the page from the server
[16:02:26] <grafi> dafuq
[16:02:29] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[16:02:36] <duch_kazatel> via ajax?
[16:02:39] <grafi> why in gods name
[16:02:43] <raj> and then just use $content.replaceWith($newcontent)
[16:02:47] <duch_kazatel> LMAO
[16:02:51] <duch_kazatel> dude that's going to be a nightmare.
[16:02:54] <duch_kazatel> and slooooowwwwww
[16:03:04] <raj> why is it a nightmare?
[16:03:14] <raj> and how else would I load pages without refreshing the page?
[16:03:26] <duch_kazatel> why are you so afraid of page refreshing?
[16:03:38] <duch_kazatel> you're instead making the client-side to a fuckton of extra work.
[16:03:45] <raj> cuz it's smoother not to
[16:03:53] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible reason.
[16:04:10] <duch_kazatel> you do realize taht everybody that did exactly what you're talking about moved away from it for the most part, right?
[16:04:28] <raj> I have 3 main sections, those are the only sections that require the ajax loading of a page
[16:04:33] <duch_kazatel> your page responsiveness and speed is going to be nightmarishly slow for most users.
[16:04:54] <raj> usually while in a section, you stay in that section
[16:05:07] <raj> will it be slow after the ajax call and replaceWith are done?
[16:05:37] <duch_kazatel> that's terrible reasoning.  plus it's causing you to bind to events all weird
[16:05:37] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:05:37] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[16:05:37] <duch_kazatel> the whole thing will feel clunky.
[16:05:47] <duch_kazatel> is the content in each section dynamic?
[16:06:10] <raj> well, data is retrieved from ajax, yes
[16:06:16] <duch_kazatel> is the data itself dynamic?
[16:06:21] <raj> no really, no
[16:06:24] <raj> *not really
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> ...
[16:06:31] <raj> dynamic how?
[16:06:43] <raj> it's a bunch of video links, for example
[16:06:45] <hexacode> hey you guys. in jquery animate, it takes in an easing string. where can i find possible string values to pass to this function?
[16:06:53] <raj> with thumbnails
[16:07:07] <duch_kazatel> raj do those get served up as a static list while the user is browsing?
[16:07:24] <duch_kazatel> like, is it basically an html page?
[16:07:31] <duch_kazatel> that you're sending via ajax?
[16:07:36] <raj> yes, unless he changes one of the optoins on the side, in which case it'll do another ajax fetch of json
[16:07:43] <raj> oh no
[16:07:45] <raj> it's just json
[16:08:25] <duch_kazatel> so why can't this json just be embedded in the page itself and you skip all the ajax?
[16:08:49] <raj> cuz there's a lot
[16:09:02] <raj> that's why there are options to cut it down (filter)
[16:09:33] <duch_kazatel> you really need to re-engineer then and treat each section as a different page - don't use ajax more than you absolutely have to.
[16:09:37] <duch_kazatel> just the content section, for instace.
[16:09:40] <duch_kazatel> *instance
[16:10:38] <T13> Can I get someone to look over http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/5GpuH/ and show me why it's not working, please?
[16:11:13] <raj> duch_kazatel, what if it's just ajax loading html into the page once
[16:11:17] <raj> is that a big deal?
[16:11:26] <duch_kazatel> then why use ajax?
[16:11:43] <duch_kazatel> that's the entire problem - you're relying on javascript to do things that your server and html should really handle.
[16:11:58] <duch_kazatel> T13 what are you expecting?
[16:13:07] <raj> hmm
[16:13:17] <raj> duch_kazatel, so you're against single page sites?
[16:13:26] <raj> they're so smooth though
[16:13:34] <duch_kazatel> that's entirely dependent on WHY you think you need it ;)
[16:13:39] <duch_kazatel> but most people do them wrong.
[16:13:47] <duch_kazatel> and they're not "smooth" for a lot of end users.
[16:14:05] <raj> do you have a shitty computer you test on?
[16:14:14] <raj> for slow end-users?
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> at home yeah.
[16:14:33] <duch_kazatel> but i try to make things as lightweight as possible.
[16:14:56] <T13> All of the | 4 since last visit | to disappear and just be a |
[16:15:41] <raj> so duch_kazatel, assuming I'm correct in making my website singlepage, is turning hash to query the best way to resolve this you think?
[16:15:49] <raj> also, isn't #tab=side a hash still?
[16:16:24] <duch_kazatel> yes, that is a hash, but you've coded yourself into a corner.  you'll probably need to rewrite ALL of your URL handling logic.
[16:18:14] <duch_kazatel> imo javascript should be last on your list of things to add functionality.
[16:18:34] <duch_kazatel> users are fine with page reloads generally.
[16:18:47] <duch_kazatel> they're used to them at this point.
[16:22:18] <eddief1029> T13 your selector is wrong siblings is gonna find siblings to td, but the since last is a child of td.... try http://jsfiddle.net/uWzhZ/
[16:22:24] <eddief1029> i think thats what you want anyway
[16:23:50] <T13> Looking
[16:24:18] <raj> duch_kazatel, I will definitely look into the urldispatch again
[16:24:26] <raj> thank you for the talk!
[16:27:20] <duch_kazatel> raj - not a problem.  just remember - if what you're doing seem soverly hard, you might want to rethink it.
[16:29:19] <T13> eddief1029: almost
[16:29:45] <raj> it doesn't seem overly hard, really, I was just running into a snafu with getting window.onstatechange to recognize hash changes. So i added window.onhashchange, but that doesn't fire for the most part, not sure why. Therefore, I added on window.anchorchange, but that fires on page load (as well as window.onstatechange), when there is an anchor in the url
[16:29:52] <T13>  It's just not running the part after the replaceWith()
[16:30:13] <duch_kazatel> raj why are you extending window like that? O.o
[16:31:02] <raj> I thought that's already part of window
[16:31:03] <T13> The cleanup.  .text().replace(' | â–ª', '')
[16:31:14] <raj> I don't remember "extending" it, unless history.js did it
[16:31:16] <duch_kazatel> "I added on window.anchorchange"...
[16:31:28] <raj> oh, yeah, that's a history.js thing
[16:31:48] <raj> cuz onhashchange doesn't trigger a statechange
[16:31:58] <raj> or something
[16:32:04] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[16:32:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[16:32:05] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:32:54] <T13> eddief1029: FooBar line should look like BarFoo line
[16:33:12] <eddief1029> oh
[16:37:43] <T13> http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/5GpuH/ has been updated btw
[16:38:38] <hexacode> anyone know what easing strings jquery animate accepts?
[16:38:47] <hexacode> i cant find it anywhere in their site
[16:38:57] <hexacode> they just say it accepts an easing string but dont say what
[16:44:42] <eddief1029> T13 do you have access to the html? why dont you do something like: http://jsfiddle.net/EuHy6/

[16:53:20] <rOOb> Hello all. I'm using slimbox which is based off lightbox and I'm trying to make it so that when a user opens a image in slimbox it offers a "download" link to the original size photo. On their page it shows how this can be done. But I'm using a medium size thumbnail for the images slimbox uses and I want the download link to be the original fullsize image. The example I would like to use is

[16:54:08] <rOOb> I just do not know enough how to change that so I can dynamically insert the link to the full sized image apposed to it using the medium sized one(el.href)
[17:10:19] <T13> Woot.. got it
[17:10:21] <hexacode> anyone here know how to use jquery ui....when i downloaded it i got a folder with a million files...i was expecting just one js file that i could externally link to my html page. now it seems a million times more complicated
[17:11:07] <sammich> I would hope someone knows how to use jQuery UI here ;)
[17:11:59] <TelFiRE> Hey guys, I have an odd issue. I have some slideshows, that are hidden when the page first loads. But if I open one of them, then close it again, then resize my browser, then open it againâ€¦ all of the CSS still appears as it did before the resize (i.e., it doesn't pick up the media queries unless you resize it again while it is showing). You can see this here: http://dev.whywaitwebs.com/portfolio Really appreciate any pointers.
[17:12:25] <sammich> hexacode: you want the file in .zip/ui/jquery-ui.js
[17:12:29] <Lucky--> i officially killed windows8. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/493327/windows8blackscreenofdeath.jpg
[17:12:42] <sammich> you'll also want the themes files
[17:13:00] <hexacode> sammich do you have an absolute path to that?
[17:13:14] <hexacode> or is that in the crap i downloaded
[17:13:17] <sammich> i'd just copy it to whereever you put your files
[17:13:26] <sammich> you got the .zip right?
[17:15:02] <hexacode> sammich,  ya i got a zip...from there page there were alot of components i could check off but i just left all of them checked and when i unzipped it, there were scatteered files everywhere
[17:15:11] <hexacode> their page*
[17:15:32] <hexacode> im just looking to use jquery ui easing abilitites
[17:15:34] <hexacode> abilities
[17:16:04] <hexacode> sammich what do you mean theme files?
[17:16:31] <sammich> well, that's if you're using jQuery UI for it's widgets as well
[17:17:19] <sammich> in the custom download, you should have a file with /css, js, development-bundle
[17:17:31] <sammich> you really just want the files in side css/js
[17:17:38] <sammich> in your case, just the js

[18:16:37] <ppppp_> onload in a div doesn't fire
[18:17:06] <Velveeta> divs don't support onload events
[18:17:28] <ppppp_> Ericx2x: you want document.ready()
[18:17:45] <Velveeta> what he said
[18:17:46] <ppppp_> $(document).ready
[18:17:57] <Velveeta> my body is not gonna be happy with me tomorrow
[18:18:09] <ppppp_> Velveeta: your body?
[18:18:27] <Velveeta> yeah, i left here earlier to go pick up a keg for a team outing at work
[18:18:55] <Velveeta> it was a kickball matchup between the front end engineers and the designersâ€¦ with the keg strategically located at 2nd base
[18:18:58] <Ericx2x> what does $(document).ready do
[18:19:10] <ppppp_> Ericx2x: you need to google that buddy
[18:19:17] <ppppp_> or do http://try.jquery.com/
[18:19:21] <ppppp_> the answer is in the first video
[18:19:34] <Velveeta> i was gonna answer, but your answer leads to more learning n such
[18:19:47] <ppppp_> high five, Velveeta
[18:20:09] <ppppp_> yeah, I'll gladly help people, but not if they're not even bothering to google their questions first :)
[18:20:16] <Velveeta> so my body is currently burnt to a crisp from sun exposure, and my muscles are not happy with me right now :D
[18:20:25] <hexacode> hey you guys why is the duration not working on http://hexacode.pro    $('.dropbox').animate({left:'1000px'},{duartion:800});    just paste that into the console...i keep changing the duration but no cigar.
[18:20:42] <Velveeta> it's typo'd for one thing
[18:20:45] <hexacode> the red dot should move
[18:20:48] <Velveeta> is that a copy/paste from your code?
[18:21:07] <Velveeta> duartion != duration
[18:21:11] <hexacode> from console Velveeta  i test code in console before putting into code
[18:21:20] <hexacode> umm lol thanks
[18:21:23] <hexacode> i didnt see that
[18:21:23] <ppppp_> Velveeta got this one
[18:21:23] <Velveeta> :D
[18:21:31] <Velveeta> high five maself!
[18:25:06] <boytoy_> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/6/ - how do I reuse that common bit of code into a function? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/8/
[18:25:28] <Agamemnus> does jquery provide an interface to modify CSS attributes inside style tags?
[18:27:51] <sammich> err, yes.
[18:29:40] <Velveeta> agamemnus: .css()
[18:29:52] <Velveeta> boytoy: i'm not sure what you're asking
[18:30:35] <boytoy_> Velveeta: well at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/6/ there's this same piece of code under "USED ONCE", "USED TWICE" etc., trying to put that into a function
[18:31:21] <Agamemnus> Velveeta: can you give me an example of how to use .css() to modify an attribute inside a STYLE TAG?
[18:32:09] <`NoOne> thank you Velveeta. I
[18:32:23] <`NoOne> I'll try googling .css()
[18:32:37] <Velveeta> so if you have style="padding: 10px" and you say $(myElement).css('padding', '20px') it modifies the style tagâ€¦ all properties set via css are done at the element level, i.e. via the style tag
[18:33:03] <Agamemnus> I want to modify the actual css style tag
[18:33:08] <Agamemnus> not the element's css
[18:33:19] <Agamemnus> the <style> tag
[18:33:28] <Velveeta> oh, gotcha
[18:33:48] <Velveeta> i don't think you can do that with jquery
[18:33:54] <sammich> Agamemnus: you don't realy want to do that, it's not really performant
[18:34:14] <sammich> if you really want to, just give the style tag an id or something
[18:34:24] <boytoy_> wait what about http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2465158/is-it-possible-to-remove-inline-styles-with-jquery ?
[18:34:45] <Velveeta> if you modify the style tag's contents, are they reparsed by the browser into the stylesheet collection though?
[18:34:47] <sammich> you can't actually easily search through the styles, so you'll have to do something clever to find your string and mod it
[18:34:53] <Agamemnus> that's weird as hell
[18:34:54] <sammich> Velveeta: yes
[18:35:12] <Velveeta> boytoy: i don't see a 'used once' and 'used twice' section in the link you posted
[18:35:15] <sammich> boytoy_: that's as simply as going .attr('style', '')
[18:35:15] <Velveeta> sammich: interesting
[18:35:47] <Agamemnus> there's this: http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript
[18:35:59] <Agamemnus> but it's missing a modification function..... which I could make myself
[18:36:08] <boytoy_> Velveeta: oops my bad: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/9/
[18:36:08] <Agamemnus> i've just been wondering if jquery has a way to do this
[18:36:11] <sammich> that's a really old site, damn
[18:36:21] <Agamemnus> because any time I check google, it just gives me .css() stuff
[18:36:24] <Velveeta> i'm not sure why you would want to do something like that thoughâ€¦ why modify the css w/ javascript when you can edit the files directly, or override the rules with specificity?
[18:36:32] <sammich> Agamemnus: what are you trying to achieve?
[18:36:33] <tw2113> jQuery can't do everything
[18:37:08] <Agamemnus> well, let's say I have some class I'd like to modify the properties of based on some data I receive
[18:37:10] <Velveeta> heya tw
[18:37:23] <Agamemnus> the class is defined already on the appropriate objects
[18:37:25] <Agamemnus> DOM objects
[18:37:31] <Velveeta> but why modify the properties of a given css class as opposed to just selecting a different css class based on some data you receive?
[18:37:36] <Agamemnus> but I don't want to care about what the objects are
[18:37:37] <sammich> Agamemnus: it's better you set your styles via a control class
[18:37:54] <Agamemnus> so, select all objects of a particular class?
[18:38:08] <sammich> say you want a table to highlight certain cells depending on a mode
[18:38:11] <Velveeta> if (data.whatImExpecting) { $('.controlClass').addClass('augmentingClass'); }
[18:38:16] <Agamemnus> what if a new object is made with that class?
[18:38:22] <sammich> you can have all of your td's with the correct classes already applied
[18:38:44] <sammich> in your css you'll have .controlClass.highlightModeX
[18:38:48] <sammich> oops
[18:38:48] <Velveeta> if you're having to worry about modifying css programmatically, it sounds like something's gone horribly awry in the way your application is set up...
[18:38:50] <sammich> in your css you'll have .controlClass .highlightModeX
[18:39:08] <sammich> and you'll set .controlClass on your table, or whereever
[18:39:36] <Agamemnus> what if a new dom object is made with that class?
[18:39:46] <sammich> which class?
[18:39:48] <Agamemnus> i'd have to modify those objects again
[18:39:52] <Agamemnus> the class in question
[18:39:52] <Velveeta> set a variable somewhere when you get your data response
[18:39:54] <Agamemnus> whatever class.
[18:39:59] <Velveeta> and check that whenever a new dom object is made with that class
[18:40:02] <Agamemnus> that is brittle
[18:40:12] <Velveeta> and modifying the css directly via js isn't?
[18:40:18] <Agamemnus> i would rather modify the css class itself
[18:40:21] <Agamemnus> no, it isn't
[18:40:24] <Velveeta> yes, it is...
[18:40:31] <Agamemnus> because it does exactly what I want.
[18:40:44] <Velveeta> it's a hack to cover bad development practices
[18:40:46] <sammich> no you don't
[18:40:52] <Agamemnus> it is not a bad development practice
[18:40:57] <Velveeta> it absolutely is
[18:41:00] <boytoy_> Agamemnus: a slave with a gun to his head will also do what you want
[18:41:01] <Agamemnus> why?
[18:41:13] <sammich> Agamemnus: we're telling you, it's not performant
[18:41:20] <Agamemnus> why?
[18:41:37] <Velveeta> because css is meant to style your document items based on class you *predefine*, not classes you programmatically alter to fit your business logic
[18:41:44] <Velveeta> boytoy: i'm coming back around to you, i promise
[18:42:11] <Agamemnus> oh? explain lessCSS?
[18:42:12] <boytoy_> coolio
[18:42:20] <Agamemnus> And similar javascript libraries?
[18:42:22] <Velveeta> lesscss is a precompiler
[18:42:26] <Agamemnus> Just a big non-performant joke?
[18:42:34] <Velveeta> it still spits out css that's meant to stay static once it's been compiled
[18:42:46] <sammich> LESS?
[18:42:56] <Velveeta> it doesn't depend on program flow to alter what's spit out of the compiler, it just adds a layer of abstraction for ease of writing it in the first place
[18:42:59] <Agamemnus> LessCSS gets its data from a specific file
[18:43:31] <Agamemnus> a static file, though you could probably feed it a file and it'll do the modifications
[18:43:38] <Agamemnus> so it's really exactly the same thing.
[18:43:43] <Velveeta> you could probably do a lot of things that are bad patterns
[18:43:47] <Velveeta> that doesn't make them good patterns
[18:43:56] <Velveeta> so it's really not at all the same thing
[18:43:57] <Agamemnus> and guess what?
[18:44:02] <Agamemnus> Javascript has goto
[18:44:08] <Velveeta> whoopty doo
[18:44:10] <Agamemnus> that doesn't mean you shouldn't use it.
[18:44:15] <Agamemnus> etcetcetc
[18:44:19] <Agamemnus> you guys are silly
[18:44:25] <Velveeta> javascript has eval also, that doesn't mean it's a good thing to use
[18:44:25] <Agamemnus> jquery is a bad pattern
[18:44:32] <Velveeta> lol
[18:44:35] <Agamemnus> eval has it uses too
[18:44:42] <Velveeta> sure, for bad developers
[18:44:42] <sammich> yeah, eval is a bad pattern
[18:44:54] <sammich> just like you can write SQL without using params
[18:44:54] <Velveeta> eval is a crutch for people that don't know how to otherwise write their code
[18:45:10] <Agamemnus> ok, how are you going to EVALuate a mathematical experession without eval?
[18:45:19] <Agamemnus> you're going to insert a library that does the same thing?
[18:45:20] <sammich> a = 1 + 1
[18:45:30] <Velveeta> store your params in variables and process them?
[18:45:31] <Agamemnus> an expression in a string.
[18:45:32] <Phlow> eval has its uses
[18:45:40] <Agamemnus> you're going to create a math parser?
[18:45:46] <Agamemnus> rather than use what you already have?
[18:46:02] <Velveeta> you shouldn't be feeding javascript something like a string of mathematical equation to evaluate, that *bad pattern*
[18:46:08] <Agamemnus> anything can be a bad pattern if you use it the wrong way
[18:46:19] <Velveeta> you don't seem to be wrapping your head around the concept that just because you can do something, doesn't make it a good idea
[18:46:21] <Agamemnus> sure, velveeta, sure
[18:46:34] <tw2113> *popcorn*
[18:47:01] <Agamemnus> i know that, Velveeta
[18:47:07] <Velveeta> tw: http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/popcorn-go.gif
[18:47:07] <sammich> we need one of the jQuery gods
[18:47:13] <Agamemnus> but just because it's a bad idea SOMETIMES doesn't mean it's a bad idea ALL the time
[18:47:42] <sammich> Agamemnus: so, you're saying your idea is good because it's not bad all the time?
[18:47:57] <Agamemnus> i'm saying that you shouldn't dismiss it
[18:48:00] <Velveeta> so, you came in here asking for help with a bad ideaâ€¦ you were given the answer, plus told that hey, this isn't a great idea to begin with, and when you were given reasons why, your answer was "lalalalalala <fingers stuck in ears> jquery is a bad pattern"
[18:48:27] <Agamemnus> you should be on TV
[18:48:34] <Velveeta> jerry! jerry! jerry!
[18:48:37] <sammich> Agamemnus: so, what do you want from us?
[18:48:47] <sammich> do you want us to rubberstamp your idea?
[18:48:49] <sammich> I can do that
[18:48:52] <Agamemnus> just wanted to know if jquery could manipulate CSS styles
[18:49:05] <sammich> already told you the answer
[18:49:09] <Agamemnus> I know
[18:49:18] <Agamemnus> but you asked me what I wanted to know
[18:49:21] <Agamemnus> so I told you
[18:49:22] <Agamemnus> :x
[18:49:23] <Velveeta> boytoy: to get back to your question about abstracting that out into a function
[18:49:29] <sammich> alright
[18:49:38] <tw2113> it can manipluate css, with .css()
[18:49:42] <boytoy_> yes please
[18:49:48] <Agamemnus> have fun guys, i'm out
[18:49:49] <tw2113> you want it to manipulate within <style>
[18:49:52] <sammich> aww
[18:49:52] <boytoy_> not a big fan of popcorn anyhow
[18:50:02] <Agamemnus> :[]
[18:50:07] <Velveeta> you can do something like this: function checkIsDiv () { return $(this).children().children().last().is('div'); }
[18:50:29] <Velveeta> and then in those places where it's being called, do something like this: lastChildIsDropdown = checkIsDiv.call(this);
[18:50:38] <boytoy_> oh that would be sweet, lemme try that
[18:51:07] <Velveeta> might want to change that function name to be something more reflective of the check, like function lastChildIsDropdown () or something
[18:52:03] <Velveeta> that guy's lucky i've been drinking beer all day, or else i might have actually told him how i felt
[18:52:36] <Velveeta> <rimshot> â€¦â€¦.. <tumbleweed>
[18:52:53] <tw2113> Velveeta, here's my goto popcorn gif http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/58684481085/public-flame-thread-in-progress
[18:53:07] <Velveeta> lol, nice
[18:54:18] <boytoy_> Velveeta: similar to this? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/10/
[18:54:45] <Velveeta> close
[18:54:54] <Velveeta> but you don't need anything but the first line in that function
[18:55:14] <Velveeta> that jquery chain will evaluate to a boolean that you can just return
[18:55:30] <boytoy_> what really?
[18:55:40] <boytoy_> oooh weee jquery is awesome
[18:55:50] <Velveeta> javascript* is awesome
[18:56:02] <boytoy_> yes ofcourse :)
[18:56:03] <tw2113> what cheesemaster said
[18:56:28] <Velveeta> think about that if-statement condition, you're saying if (thisStatementIsTrue) { lastChildisDropdown = true; } else { lastChildIsDropdown = false; }
[18:56:53] <Velveeta> so instead of evaluating whether that statement is true or false and setting true or false, just return the true false that it evaluates to directly into your variable assignment
[18:58:04] <boytoy_> i think i see it
[18:58:09] <boytoy_> very cool technique, i had no idea
[18:58:25] <Velveeta> and that, my friends, is how you take critiquing and learn from it
[18:58:58] <boytoy_> will be sure to pass it onto my sons and daughters too :)
[18:59:10] <sammich> you're wrong.
[18:59:15] <Velveeta> as will i! â€¦.but to my own, because otherwise that might be creepy
[18:59:21] <Velveeta> sammich: jquery is wrong
[18:59:37] <boytoy_> ha!
[18:59:42] <sammich> meh
[18:59:50] <boytoy_> anyway 1-2-3 bam: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/NA5AD/11/
[19:00:10] <Velveeta> that looks about right
[19:00:15] <boytoy_> thanks a bunch Velveeta
[19:00:15] <Velveeta> does it behave as expected?
[19:00:17] <sammich> jQuery is good enough
[19:00:18] <boytoy_> yup
[19:00:18] <Velveeta> no problemo
[19:00:28] <boytoy_> perfect
[19:04:12] <Velveeta> that guy also could have simply done something like, check if his data response was whatever he wanted in order to trigger modifying his css rule, and instead, add a css class to his body tag
[19:04:34] <Velveeta> then he could have predefined css rules for body.augmented .className { newRules }
[19:04:55] <Velveeta> and then as other nodes are created with the original class name, they'd still pick up that new styling
[19:05:21] <Velveeta> dammit, me, why didn't i think of this at the time he was in here
[19:14:59] <sammich> Velveeta: I mentioned that, but it's not really clear without an example
[19:15:10] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:15:25] <Velveeta> he probably wasn't interested anyway
[19:15:33] <Velveeta> he seemed to have his mind set on that solution
[19:16:15] <sammich> pretty much why I had an empty fiddle still open for him
[19:16:20] <sammich> or her
[19:21:59] <sammich> oh, so *that's* how you use emmet in jsbin
[20:30:17] <T13> $('.FooBar').each(function() { this.innerHTML = this.innerHTML.replace("Foo", "Bar"); }); can be cleaned up to all jQuery something like: $('.FooBar').each(function() { $(this)html().replace("Foo", "Bar"); });
[20:30:46] <T13> Right?
[20:31:49] <T13> Velveeta: ??
[20:32:31] <Velveeta> reading through it, one sec
[20:33:08] <Velveeta> almost, you'll have to reassign it back into the html w/ another html function call, like so:
[20:33:50] <Velveeta> $('.FooBar').each(function () { $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/Foo/g, 'Bar'); });
[20:34:27] <Velveeta> er, with an extra closing parens at the end of the replace
[20:34:51] <T13> { $(this).html($(this).html().replace('Foo', 'Bar'));}
[20:35:03] <Velveeta> right
[20:35:37] <Velveeta> also, anytime i'm running anything through the jquery init function more than once, i cache it for performance
[20:35:45] <Velveeta> so like var $this = $(this);
[20:35:48] <T13> Do I have to /Foo/g or will 'Foo' work the same?
[20:36:01] <Velveeta> i believe 'Foo' would work the same
[20:37:06] <T13> Thanks... I'll try that out.
[20:37:14] <Velveeta> no problem
[20:46:52] <rgr> best way to select an element who dosnt have an ancestor of class C?
[20:50:22] <LiENUS> chardin.js is nice heh
[20:50:27] <LiENUS> though no xhtml support
[20:50:35] <LiENUS> yet
[20:50:50] <T13> Velveeta: it doesn't seem to have worked..  could the clising be ...'Bar'););} ?
[20:51:10] <Velveeta> you need to ditch the semicolon between those 2 closing parens
[20:51:17] <Velveeta> )); instead
[20:51:33] <T13> That's what I have..
[20:51:56] <Velveeta> rgr: any particular element selector you're interested in, or just *any* that doesn't have ancestor .C?
[20:52:00] <T13> I'll try bypassing and reloading again
[20:53:34] <Velveeta> assuming elements of class myClass that have no ancestor of class C, you could do $('.myClass').filter(function(){ return !$(this).parents('.C').length; });
[20:54:22] <T13> $('span.mw-title').parent('td').find('a:contains(" since last visit")').replaceWith('âˆž'); $('td').each(function(){ $(this).text($(this).text().replace('| âˆž |', '|')); }
[20:54:45] <T13> Velveeta: that's my actual code... and it's not working.
[20:54:58] <T13> At least not in this browser.
[20:55:03] <Velveeta> let me copy that into a text editor and indent it some to see what you have going on there
[20:58:20] <T13> I had a fiddle, but laptop died and it doesn't load well in Firefox on Android.
[20:59:18] <Velveeta> ok, so to make sure i'm reading this right, you're trying to find all of those anchors that have 'since last visit' and replace the anchors themselves with infinities
[20:59:44] <Velveeta> and then go through all of those td's and replace | <infinity> | with just |, to effective just strip that stuff out, right?
[21:00:07] <Velveeta> effectively*
[21:02:50] <T13> Yes.  Fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/5GpuH/
[21:02:59] <T13> :)
[21:05:00] <sammich> anyone used iScroll 5beta?
[21:05:15] <sammich> I want to know how to turn on a scroller for it
[21:05:52] <rgr> Velveeta: what about an immediate prent of C? I thought maybe smeting like $(".root :not(.C) .myclass") - why would this not work?
[21:06:35] <Velveeta> t13: if i comment out the last part of that, and just let it insert the infinities, that part works, which is weird, because i would then expect the 2nd part to break and leave the infinities in place, but they revert to their text
[21:06:37] <T13> Was missing ); at end of function, but still not cleaning out | â˜† |
[21:07:24] <T13> $('span.mw-title').parent('td').find('a:contains(" since last visit")').replaceWith('âˆž'); $('td').each(function(){ $(this).text($(this).text().replace('| âˆž |', '|')); });
[21:07:43] <T13> ); on end was missing
[21:07:49] <Velveeta> got it
[21:09:21] <T13> Still not stripping | % | and I'm befuddled as to why.
[21:10:13] <Velveeta> $('span.mw-title').parent('td').find('a:contains(" since last visit")').replaceWith('âˆž');
[21:10:13] <Velveeta> $('td').each(function(){ $(this).text($(this).text().replace(/\|\s+âˆž\s+\|/, '|')); });
[21:10:41] <Velveeta> you have nonbreaking spaces in there, &nbsp;, and your replace string is running against a standard space, which doesn't match
[21:10:54] <Velveeta> use a regular expression to target whitespace characters in general
[21:11:20] <T13> But don't I skip all that by using .text instead of .html ?
[21:12:04] <Velveeta> .text gets the textual characters as opposed to the tag information, but i don't know that it transforms text into a rendered state per se
[21:13:25] <T13> I tried alert($('td').text() +'\n\n'+ $('td').html());
[21:14:01] <T13> And it showed the &nbsp; only on .html
[21:14:24] <T13> So, I thought it would be clear that way.
[21:15:10] <T13> Incidentally, the &nbsp; never moves and I could try it with it in there and use .html
[21:16:24] <Ericx2x> hey guys, i need to find a image slider that can handle this overflow text here is what it should look like https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/slides.png
[21:16:37] <Ericx2x> does anynoe have any suggestions on which slider can accomplish this best?
[21:16:54] <Velveeta> yeah i would say that for one thing, you'll probably want to use .html because text will lose the info of any other tags, and you have multiple anchors in those td's i believe
[21:17:24] <TelFiRE> Ericx2x: I think most any slideshow can do that. I usually use Flexslider.
[21:19:11] <T13> ... back to the fiddle...
[21:22:03] <Velveeta> don't fiddle with it too much, you'll go blind
[21:28:00] <T13> $('span.mw-title').parent('td').find('a:contains(" since last visit")').replaceWith('âˆž'); $('td').each(function(){ $(this).html($(this).html().replace('| âˆž&nbsp;|','|')); });
[21:28:07] <T13> ^^^ works
[21:28:19] <Velveeta> ok good
[21:28:42] <Velveeta> is there a reason you're opposed to a regular expression? just out of curiosity
[21:45:57] <sammich> best scroller plugin with touch support?
[22:05:23] <Ericx2x> TelFiRE are you there?
[22:05:34] <TelFiRE> Ericx2x: whatup
[22:06:08] <Ericx2x> I'm using flex slider and I dont understand how i get the dots inside the image
[22:06:23] <TelFiRE> just change the css
[22:06:43] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[22:07:01] <Ericx2x> i was trying to do it with the custome properties
[22:07:31] <TelFiRE> Ericx2x: yeah just do like, .flex-control-nav{ bottom: 80px; } (adjust for whatever size your images are)
[22:09:29] <Ericx2x> TelFiRE how do you get them to stay above the slider images
[22:09:37] <Ericx2x> oh wait z-index
[22:37:00] <ussher_> .jQCloud  draws a great tag cloud with clickable links, but it draws it on every page load.  any simple ways to cache it to make pageload quicker?
[23:21:10] <hexacode> hey you guys..i have a set of divs with all the same class and they are image containers...they all are lines up nicely with css styles applied to them; however, i end up creating more of these divs dynamically with js, and when they get created, they dont have the css styles applied. how can i get these newly created divs with images inside them to also take on the styles declared in the externam css file ?
[23:26:15] <sammich> hexacode: why don't you just give those divs your styles...
