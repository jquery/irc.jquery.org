[00:00:17] <shoky> BrazenBraden: $('#container').on('change', '.divClass select', function() { .. })
[00:00:18] <Onyx47> BrazenBraden, $('.div-class > select').on('change', function(event) { ... });
[00:00:44] <BrazenBraden> hmm thanks guys.. will give both those a shot
[00:01:05] <shoky> i recommend mine since it only uses one event handler instead of many, and it will work even if the divs/selects are not in the DOM yet
[00:01:15] <shoky> it's generally preferable
[00:02:04] <BrazenBraden> aight.. testing now
[00:02:10] <Onyx47> yup, I see the advantage, well, you learn something new... :P
[00:02:52] <BrazenBraden> briliant shoky, thanks!
[00:14:32] <DeSmOnD> hi
[00:14:45] <DeSmOnD> can anyone help me ?
[00:15:01] <DeSmOnD> here is code , http://jsfiddle.net/T9R2V/3/
[00:15:17] <DeSmOnD> If you open the fiddle, and click on "Add identifier", a row will be added and "Remove Identifier" link will be seen. Now , due to my incorrect coding, it is appearing below the same row in which "identifier type" and "identifier number" appears. I want that "remove identifier" in the same row , not below.
[00:19:36] <DeSmOnD> hi
[00:21:52] <Yahkob> thi
[00:21:55] <Yahkob> hi*
[00:27:00] <DeSmOnD> hi
[00:30:49] <xqo> hey
[00:35:48] <thom_> hello....
[00:35:50] <thom_> is anyone working
[00:36:03] <thom_> im very rusty and my fade in and fade out is not seemless
[00:37:27] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:47:21] <bigbugjava> Hi, I append a table from facebook api, to my html, I append profile picture, name, and ID, the ID is hidden, profile picture visable with checkbox for each one, and the name as title(when hover you can see him), I need to create a search for that title, is that at all possible?
[00:49:58] <fabioportieri> yes
[00:54:39] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri hi man, got any ideas where I can find guides?
[00:59:25] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: check facebook graph api
[00:59:55] * FiLoSsOfIe hello
[01:03:34] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri it's on my page.. It has nothing to do with facebook anymore.. I'm thinking getting the data to datatable..
[01:04:21] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: aniway you need to access fb api
[01:53:12] <lite_> I have the following issue: I wish to be able to press and hold a button(in this case "ongoing") and release it on one of the items in the dialog that appears. however this only works "some of the time" on mobile. we're using angularjs and hammerjs. http://embed.plnkr.co/gtdOs9NbtLANf7hVKOQb/preview
[01:58:23] <seutje> lite_: not all that familiar with angular, are you preventDefaulting the default drag event?
[02:00:56] <seutje> lite_: actually, it looks like the faulty drag happens on the overlay .dlg_overlay
[02:01:15] <lite_> nope
[02:03:04] <seutje> well, when I end up dragging something, that's what I end up dragging
[02:03:14] <seutje> and removing it causes me to be unable to reproduce the issue
[02:03:21] <lite_> uhm
[02:03:29] <lite_> the problem only occurs on mobile
[02:03:32] <seutje> also, user-select isn't disabled on the popup bit, causing me to select the options
[02:03:40] <seutje> nope
[02:04:37] <lite_> seutje: try again
[02:04:49] <lite_> just fixed the "user select issue"
[02:05:55] <lite_> 'faulty' drag as in the one that doesn select the item your drag ends on ?
[02:05:55] <lite_> doesnt*
[02:06:19] <seutje> oh
[02:06:30] <seutje> I meant as in "I'm actually dragging something"
[02:06:42] <seutje> but I can't seem to reproduce that anymore since u fixed the user select bit
[02:06:47] <lite_> yeah :)
[02:06:59] <lite_> but that shouldnt occur anyways on mobile devices
[02:07:33] <lite_> this issue is specifically on mobile devices
[02:08:25] <seutje> lite_: you're binding on click, right?
[02:08:42] <bigbugjava> is there a site with transparent backgrounds/photos ? that is recommened for websites use?
[02:09:35] <lite_> im also binding on click(tab). basically there are 3 ways to select a new item. 1 is toggle which toggles between the options simply by pressing the button. 2 is long pressing the button which opens up the list widget where you can specifically select the one you wish
[02:09:51] <lite_> the third one is where you touch and drag your finger to the one you wish to select
[02:10:11] <seutje> lite_: yeah, I mean inside the widget, you bind to click, but try binding to mouseup only
[02:11:19] <seutje> bigbugjava: you mean like stock photos?
[02:11:39] <lite_> i bind to dragstart, dragend, hold and tap
[02:12:11] <bigbugjava> seutje not familer with stock photos
[02:14:34] <seutje> well u preventDefault on the dragstart, so dragend never fires
[02:15:02] <lite_> seutje: well then why does it work some of the time ?
[02:15:28] <lite_> if i preventDefault then i'd assume it would never work
[02:16:02] <seutje> lite_: the ng-click, I assume
[02:16:58] <bigbugjava> seutje> you have a site mate?
[02:17:55] <seutje> bigbugjava: nosir, I was just wondering what you meant by your question
[02:19:00] <seutje> lite_: actually, I have no clue why it works some of the times, I'd assume it to never work with click or dragend: http://jsfiddle.net/UB78R/
[02:21:19] <seutje> lite_: might be a bit more clear to see what's going on: http://jsfiddle.net/UB78R/1/
[02:27:40] <lite_> seutje: your solution there doesnt work on mobile :)
[02:28:26] <seutje> lite_: how so?
[02:28:59] <seutje> I was merely trying to show that killing dragstart prevents dragend from firing
[02:30:31] <rubyracer> does the document.raedy event in jquery not fire when a link is clicked in the application?
[02:31:01] <Cork> rubyracer: no it is fired when the document has loaded and is ready to be modified
[02:32:04] <rubyracer> Cork, ah... ok. I have a rails application and I am using a link to navigate between pages and the document.ready is not fired. Is there any way to make jquery think a new page is loaded
[02:32:40] <Cork> rubyracer: not if you are loading the target through ajax
[02:33:24] <Cork> ex. the turbo-links will do this
[02:33:46] <rubyracer> Cork, I don't have a ajax loader. It is a link (anchor tag) that redirects to another controller/action. But on the new action, the document.ready doesnt fire again
[02:33:53] <Cork> are you sure?
[02:34:03] <Cork> i think turbo-links is on by default in newer rails
[02:34:17] <seutje> haha, "turbo-links"
[02:34:42] <seutje> the successor to the mega-menu
[02:34:45] <rubyracer> Cork, I'll google turbo-links. Not sure what that means
[02:35:22] <Cork> rubyracer: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#turbolinks
[02:35:22] <seutje> isn't hyper generally considered > turbo?
[02:36:16] <rubyracer> Cork, Thank you :)
[02:36:58] <lite_> seutje: but it doesnt. in my plnkr, dragend fires some of the time.
[02:38:35] <seutje> lite_: wouldn't that suggest you are (accidentally or not) actually dragging something?
[03:28:56] <Vishal_> Hey hi, I am doing form validation (using Javascript and JQuery) on form submit event. But it shows all alert boxes. I tried to return false after getting invalid entry. but still getting alert boxes. Please Help.
[03:37:29] <cannap> Vishal_ link?
[03:37:34] <cannap> ctrl+f5
[03:51:30] <drager> I dynamically create elements with ajax calls and when I'm up in about 100 the browsers freezes. Ideas?
[03:53:53] <Cork> drager: sounds like you might be getting memory leaks or similar
[03:54:15] <Cork> so make sure you don't keep onto old values
[03:54:40] <Cork> also check so you don't trigger more reflows then you need to
[03:59:05] <drager> Cork: I create my element like this; https://dpaste.de/oaww and then I use all those values to perform different tasks; like move the element and so on.
[04:00:04] <Cork> drager: you cause 11 reflows in that code
[04:00:35] <Cork> drager: create the windowEl append the other elements to it
[04:00:43] <Cork> THEN add the windowEl to the desktopEl
[04:01:42] <Cork> drager: also depending on what you do with the return value you might keep all the data alive for indefinite
[04:03:31] <drager> Cork: I'm using the return data in other prototype functions for like moving the element, and so on
[04:04:09] <Cork> so again, you might keep the data around indefinitely
[04:04:27] <clime> hey anyone familiar with magnific popup plugin? I need to display a full html page in a popup and not sure how to do it.
[04:04:28] <Cork> causing the gc to take very long to run
[04:07:17] <drager> Cork: https://dpaste.de/oJqq
[04:48:37] <lite_> I have the following issue: I wish to be able to press and hold a button(in this case "ongoing") and release it on one of the items in the dialog that appears. however this only works "some of the time" on mobile. we're using angularjs and hammerjs. http://embed.plnkr.co/gtdOs9NbtLANf7hVKOQb/preview . update: it would appear that 'dragstart' isnt triggered sometimes because a 'release' event is thrown right before that.
[05:13:55] <bberry> hey guys, i am trying to create an "upload file" button on my site, where the user can propose a location on the server to put the file and can select a file from his local drive.
[05:14:20] <bberry> thing is, i have literally no idea how the actual file data would get from the users pc to the server
[05:14:39] <bberry> i would presume ajax in some manner..... :/
[05:16:23] <GreatPotato> When using each(), is there a key that is generated?
[05:16:40] <GreatPotato> .each(function(i) { console.log(i) }) for example?
[05:17:00] <GreatPotato> Ah yes there is
[05:18:54] <Cork> bberry: have a look at FormData
[05:19:01] <Cork> ?g mdn FormData
[05:19:03] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[05:38:09] <forgotmynick> hello
[05:42:28] <forgotmynick> why doesn't this work http://jsfiddle.net/kfe7v/? in chrome developer tools the url is "cancelled". if i use a url that has a 301 or 302 redirect it works (although it doesn't follow)
[05:43:02] <forgotmynick> i don't see anything relevant on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[05:51:43] <seutje> forgotmynick: crossdomain?
[05:53:08] <forgotmynick> seutje that would be it
[06:00:48] <Macaveli> Where can I find a jquery email validation plugin that is up to the latest standards? I don't want to use regex anymore. I'm asking this because most plugins I find are form validation plugins
[06:26:37] <NoiseEee> Macaveli: pointless to 'validate' an email address.
[06:26:56] <NoiseEee> Macaveli: either it sends or it doesn't.  look for a @ and move on with it - too many legal variations, and def. not for the js side
[06:35:51] <Crucials> Hey. I have a code that executes on .change which im using to test if a checkbox has been ticked or unticked. I want to have another checkbox to tick / untick multiple checkboxes.
[06:36:14] <Crucials> I did this by looping through them, and setting $(this).prop('checked', true);
[06:36:47] <Crucials> but the problem is, when they get checked this way, I need them to still go through the ".change" function
[06:36:48] <NoiseEee> Crucials: that won't fire the event.  try .trigger('change')
[06:37:06] <Crucials> almost beat me to my issue
[06:37:30] <Crucials> so I trigger('change') after i set it to true?
[06:38:47] <fabioportieri> yes because change actually triggers after the value changes and the input looses focus iirc
[06:39:10] <fabioportieri> so you force it
[06:39:23] <Crucials> alright this seems to work nicely. Thanks!
[06:40:01] <Cork> well prop changes the value on the dom, and events is for user actions, that is why you don't get the event
[06:49:55] * FiLoSsOfIe ce fac puturosiiiiii ?
[07:00:46] <machiner> how to stop onbeforeunload when pae is refreshed
[07:02:05] <SprkDev> How about this? http://pastebin.com/DYs2rnnx
[07:02:06] <SprkDev> How do I get the jquery part to work?
[07:02:36] <jedimind> why not use jsfiddle SprkDev ?
[07:02:53] <jedimind> and remove the php bits, replicating it with the rendered html instead
[07:09:49] <fabioportieri> SprkDev: you want .append not .add()
[07:15:01] <James_H> There is a bug in the current version of jquery ui that has been fixed but not released yet.  Is there a way I can get the latest version of code with fix it?
[07:19:38] <bberry> what but James_H
[07:19:40] <bberry> bug*
[07:21:45] <James_H> sorry said the bug was in jquery but is actually in jquery-ui ... http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9166
[07:22:24] <bberry> ah, gotcha
[07:23:35] <James_H> I assume I could find the code in git and just copy the fix in?
[07:25:19] <Cork> machiner: just a heads up, unbeforeunload is going away
[07:25:31] <Cork> you should prob try to find other ways to handle it
[07:25:41] <Cork> *onbeforeunload
[07:44:43] <James_H> What would I need to run to minimise the jquery-ui.js file?
[07:45:23] <Clex> James_H: you can download a minified version.'
[07:51:27] <clave_21> hello
[07:52:28] <clave_21> i need to freeze an action for 1 second after click on a button
[07:52:36] <clave_21> somebody can help?
[07:53:22] <clave_21> http://pastebin.com/L2tZAP1z
[07:53:29] <clave_21> this does not work
[07:56:52] <BillCriswell> clave_21: You don't want someone to be able to click more than once per second?
[07:59:50] <James_H> Hi Clex.  The problem is I need to patch in a bug fix that has not been released (do not think I would be able to correct patch in to already minimised file)
[08:07:33] <amcsi_work> hi
[08:07:56] <clave_21> BillCriswell: i want to prevent multiple continuous clicks on a button
[08:08:04] <amcsi_work> what can be causing my ajax request to report success when I specified dataType: 'json' and the result is text/html, even though the contents are json?
[08:08:48] <NoiseEee> amcsi_work: the response is successful.
[08:09:43] <amcsi_work> I remember jquery considering it a failure if the dataType doesn't match the Content-Type. jQuery even parses the response that was reported as html, as JSON
[08:10:08] <amcsi_work> I remember jquery being strict about this
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> clave_21: I think you just want to throttle it. If you're using underscore there's _.throttle which could help. Here's a quick demo of it: http://jsbin.com/uJAnOsu/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:12:12] <BillCriswell> It's easy enough to write one on your own, but underscore brings lots of goodies with it.
[08:13:51] <amcsi_work> someone tell me I haven't been dreaming. Even a co-worker of mine remembers this to be the case.
[08:15:34] <hlve> hi guys.
[08:16:19] <BillCriswell> amcsi_work: Like trigger an error?
[08:16:53] <amcsi_work> BillCriswell, yes, to go to error() directly instead of success().
[08:18:18] <amcsi_work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/249692/jquery-wont-parse-my-json-from-ajax-query
[08:18:22] <amcsi_work> here
[08:19:11] <amcsi_work> see, for OP in the link, jquery errors on the wrong content-type
[08:19:31] <amcsi_work> but it doesn't error for me (undesirably)
[08:20:29] <BillCriswell> It seems to error because it's not valid JSON, not that there's a mismatch? I could be wrong though.
[08:21:30] <amcsi_work> well, the guy who suggested "wrong content-type" was selected as the correct answer by OP
[08:21:45] <amcsi_work> although note that this SO question is from 2008
[08:22:49] <BillCriswell> True true.
[08:37:08] <clave_21> BillCriswell: Thank you very much. It works perfectly
[08:37:32] <clave_21> http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore/underscore-min.js
[08:40:44] <BillCriswell> clave_21: Awesome.
[08:41:25] <hopkins84> BillCriswell knows his shit :-)
[08:41:59] <BillCriswell> Trying to know Drupal currently.
[08:42:04] <BillCriswell> It's making me feel dumb.
[08:42:31] <BillCriswell> Just waiting for that "ahah" moment... Should be here any month now.
[09:23:58] <hlve> what's the best way to have jquery check if there's an empty hash at the end of a URL on page load, and if so, remove it.
[09:23:59] <hlve> o.O
[09:24:02] <hlve> Kinda hard to jsfiddle.
[09:24:17] <duch_kazatel> hlve what browsers?
[09:24:34] <duch_kazatel> you can only remove the hash symbol entirely if the browser supports pushstates
[09:24:39] <hlve> eh
[09:24:41] <hlve> shit.
[09:24:55] <BillCriswell> hlve: location.hash.length ?
[09:25:12] <BillCriswell> Oh, didn't scroll down.
[09:26:16] <duckgoose> in programming, how can you tell if B is the same as D?
[09:26:26] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose wat?
[09:26:33] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose what language?
[09:26:39] <duckgoose> like in an if statement
[09:27:02] <duch_kazatel> if it's javascript, if (B === D) {/* your code here */}
[09:27:06] <hlve> window.location.href.slice(0, -1); hm
[09:27:07] <NoiseEee> if(B===D) { //they are the same; also time to read a tutorial on programming }
[09:27:13] <duckgoose> lawl I made you draw a penis
[09:27:14] <duckgoose> :D
[09:27:25] <NoiseEee> way to go Beavis
[09:27:29] <duckgoose> :D
[09:27:46] <hlve> doesn't work in damn chrome :(
[09:28:00] <duckgoose> come on, laugh
[09:28:11] <duch_kazatel> hlve you have to do a history.replaceState();
[09:28:15] <hlve> AH! history.pushState("", document.title, window.location.pathname);
[09:28:17] <hlve> gotcha.
[09:28:19] <duch_kazatel> but that only works in IE9 and above.
[09:28:19] <hlve> Thanks!
[09:28:20] <hlve> <;
[09:28:38] <BillCriswell> I only laugh at tiny penises.
[09:29:01] <duch_kazatel> and I'd to replaceState() instead of pushState(), but again IE9 and below don't support that.
[09:30:19] <jita> jquery submit handler does not intercept $form.get(0).submit(); calls
[09:30:25] <jita> how can I make it intercept those?
[09:30:55] <duch_kazatel> hlve so you should probably do something like if (history.pushState){/* your code here */}; so you don't break old browsers.
[09:31:22] <duch_kazatel> jita have a fiddle?
[09:33:20] <Scott0_> can I convert JSON to a spreadsheet or to a database?
[09:34:20] <duch_kazatel> Scott0_ there are some databases that store data as JSON (CouchDB comes to mind), and I'm sure somebody has tried to write a parser/translater that convers JSON to a spreadsheet.
[09:34:47] <Scott0_> do.com exported my data as JSON, so im not sure what to do with that
[09:34:48] <Scott0_> :(
[09:35:04] <duch_kazatel> Scott0_ what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:35:52] <Scott0_> if I could get it into mysql, then I could export what I need as spreadsheet
[09:35:52] <Scott0_> get my tasklist from do.com into a spreadsheet
[09:36:11] <Scott0_> they are shutting down their service and only provided a JSON export of the data
[09:36:46] <duch_kazatel> looks like they're some kind of task manager... how do you expect that info to be represented in a spreadsheet?
[09:36:53] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest looking for an alternative service.
[09:36:56] <duch_kazatel> like Asana.
[09:37:06] <Scott0_> yep
[09:37:06] <Scott0_> as a list of tasks
[09:37:10] <duch_kazatel> https://asana.com/guide/best-practices/do
[09:37:12] <duch_kazatel> there.
[09:37:12] <Scott0_> id rather not go with another service that will just shutdown again
[09:37:24] <Scott0_> spreadsheets are more reliable
[09:37:40] <duch_kazatel> asana won't be leaving any time soon it looks like, and relying on spreadsheets for task management is a painful experience.
[09:37:50] <duch_kazatel> but there's no simple "convert JSON to spreadsheet" concept.
[09:37:58] <Scott0_> well do.com is essentially a glorified spreadsheet of tasks
[09:38:06] <Scott0_> a task list is essentially a list
[09:38:11] <Scott0_> and spreadsheets are lists
[09:38:51] <duch_kazatel> congrats?  again, the concept of "JSON to a spreadsheed" is the problem.  i'm not talking about your service's choice of data.
[09:39:03] <duch_kazatel> *spreadsheet
[09:39:20] <Scott0_> well I figure someone might have created something that would take a json schema and create it in a db
[09:39:34] <Scott0_> but it doesn't look like that exists
[09:39:34] <duch_kazatel> Sure - CouchDB stores all its data as JSON
[09:39:44] <Scott0_> it also stores whatever you give it
[09:39:45] <Scott0_> lol
[09:39:55] <Scott0_> so that wo0nt help much
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:40:21] <duch_kazatel> http://www.danmandle.com/blog/json-to-csv-conversion-utility/ - this looks closer to what you want./
[09:40:23] <Scott0_> the couchdb doesn't intepret the data, it just stores it
[09:40:48] <duch_kazatel> correct - CouchDB is a database.  it is not built to make assumptions for you.
[09:41:00] <Scott0_> there's no schema
[09:41:21] <Scott0_> err relationships
[09:41:41] <duch_kazatel> dude i just sent you a JSON to CSV converter.
[09:41:46] <duch_kazatel> csv -> Excel.
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[09:42:00] <lianzinho> guys, someone could help me with some bootstrap jquery issue? For some reason the tab.js plugin is getting all of the .tab-pane elements but the first one out of the tab-content container...
[09:42:06] <Scott0_> it doesn't work
[09:42:08] <Scott0_> I've tried that
[09:42:20] <lianzinho> anyone have seem this yet?
[09:42:30] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho have a working fiddle showing the problem?
[09:42:31] <Scott0_> thanks for trying
[09:42:58] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: Ill get it online, just a minute
[09:44:35] <Scott0_> I guess ill try asana
[09:44:45] <duch_kazatel> I use it.  it's been around for a while.
[09:44:51] <duch_kazatel> getflow is another popular one these days, too.
[09:45:24] <caitp> There's an issue open on AngularJS which should probably be cross-refed to jQuery, https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5099 --- it seems like a weird issue with jQuery 2.0.x expandostore. I haven't inspected this very thoroughly yet, but it appears to not be reproducible without jquery, or with older versions. So I was wondering if anyone might be able to help point out if we're doing something wrong or what
[09:46:41] <Scott0_> any preference?
[09:46:41] <Scott0_> between those 2?
[09:46:44] <fabioportieri> ehe integration bugs... no it's jquery fault! no it's angular!
[09:46:50] <duch_kazatel> Scott0_ asana for me.
[09:47:07] <caitp> well the thing is, without jquery, there's no bug
[09:47:22] <Scott0_> duch_kazatel: ok thanks
[09:47:27] <caitp> with jquery 2.0.3, there seems to be an issue, but with older builds of jquery, there's no problem
[09:47:33] <fabioportieri> those kind of bugs are a pain to sort out
[09:47:39] <caitp> yep
[09:47:43] <caitp> exactly
[09:47:48] <caitp> and it's been assigned to me, yay
[09:47:49] <duch_kazatel> caitp then perhaps they're doing something wrong on their end?  who knows!
[09:47:58] <caitp> so I'd sort of like to figure out if we're using the expandostore wrong in jqlite or what
[09:47:58] <caitp> :p
[09:48:14] <duch_kazatel> wait jqlite or jquery?
[09:48:38] <caitp> well, with jqlite, we don't seem to have a problem, but as said, with jquery 2.x it does seem to cause an issue
[09:50:05] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: hahaha, I can't reproduce it, in the fiddle it works
[09:51:05] <lianzinho> I will show will how its being rendered… the general markup is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/halianlian/3RF2h/1/
[09:58:54] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I am trying to get the index of the selected radio button i.e. First one being  0 second one being 1 etc. I am having trouble using .index()
[10:01:30] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho not seeing the issue :)
[10:01:39] <duch_kazatel> rahuldroy have a working fiddle?
[10:02:19] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel:  there's isn't anymore.. thanks, I hade a closing div which was messing up with the order

[10:10:51] <hlve> what'd be the best way to clean this up? http://pastebin.com/EG9VW3fX it functions just fine, it's just a mess.
[10:12:22] <fabioportieri> hlve: indentation helps....
[10:12:48] <hlve> it got messed up when I pasted it into pastebin :(

[10:42:57] <shoky> hlve: it's not the 'goTo' part i was wtfing about :\
[10:43:30] <hlve> i'm confused then.

[10:46:25] <zumba_addict> hey folks, how to check empty field using jqueyr?
[10:46:35] <DarkSector_> Hi, I have a bunch of checkboxes that have a category associated with them. How do I split the checkboxes into different lists by category. Here's where I am stuck http://jsfiddle.net/DarkSector/APQgu/4/
[10:46:59] <rahuldroy> Zumba_addict you can use .val() to get the value
[10:47:08] <zumba_addict> if $('.selector').val() <> ""
[10:48:18] <zumba_addict> or if $('.selector').val().length() == 0
[10:48:30] <rahuldroy> != "" or .val().length() != 0
[10:48:40] <shoky> .length
[10:48:41] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:48:52] <zumba_addict> no ()
[10:49:26] <rahuldroy> my bad :S
[10:49:38] <zumba_addict> so which is correct?
[10:50:13] <rahuldroy> .length  i.e. no ()
[10:50:20] <zumba_addict> if $('.selector').val().length != 0 like this?
[10:50:31] <rahuldroy> http://api.jquery.com/length/
[10:50:54] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:51:21] <rahuldroy> haven't tried it but should work. Make sure the selector is right though
[10:54:48] <shoky> DarkSector_ http://jsfiddle.net/APQgu/5/
[10:56:06] <DarkSector_> shoky: so it has created individual arrays right?
[10:57:13] <nsanden> how can i make this code work without combining it into a single code block? http://jsfiddle.net/kv547/
[10:58:20] <shoky> DarkSector_: yeah. http://jsfiddle.net/APQgu/6/
[10:59:51] <shoky> nsanden: like this ;] http://jsfiddle.net/kv547/1/
[11:00:38] <DarkSector_> shoky: Oooh! That's smart! Thanks, I'll fiddle with it now.
[11:00:47] <nsanden> thanks Shoky
[11:01:00] <nsanden> facepalm*
[11:10:37] <DarkSector_> shoky: How do I get the corresponding li element after having selected the input element. It's just that the li element doesn't have any attribute associated with it
[11:11:30] <shoky> DarkSector_:  $(this).closest('li')
[11:11:43] <DarkSector_> shoky: wow, gotta love jquery
[11:28:56] <zumba_addict> any ideas folks? I cannot select anymore in IE dom explorer
[11:33:17] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict what's the issue?
[11:33:39] <zumba_addict> doesn't allow me to select elements anymore inside dom explorer
[11:33:59] <zumba_addict> when I click Arrow, nothing happens
[11:33:59] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to restart IE?
[11:34:05] <zumba_addict> i've restarted IE, no luck
[11:34:25] <duch_kazatel> not sure what a jquery chat room can help you with there.  did you recently update to IE11?
[11:35:38] <zumba_addict> no, it's good now after clicking double arrow refresh

[12:09:27] <jim87> hello! I'm trying to use the smooth touch scroll ( http://smoothtouchscroll.com/ ), but I can't find a way to let it work: it generates its own inner DIVs and it changes the cursor when I'm over the scrollable area, but it's wider than the container and I can't scroll it... any idea? http://dev.mazzmedia.com/galleriasozzani/en/exhibitions/upcoming

[12:46:50] <nemik> hello, is there any way to add the 'download' attribute for a filename when doing location.href from JS?
[12:51:23] <duckgoose> nemik no
[12:52:23] <duckgoose> weather a file downloads or not depends on the Content-Type header the server sends
[12:52:53] <ramin> I try to do a ajax request to get a JSON file from a remote server. I found this: $.getJSON("http://blockchain.info/de/ticker?callback=?",function(result)
[12:52:53] <ramin> {
[12:52:53] <ramin> 	console.log(result)
[12:52:53] <ramin> 	  });
[12:52:54] <nemik> duckgoose, not really. i'm using a dataURI and that works
[12:53:15] <nemik> i just want to change the filename presented to the user
[12:53:35] <nemik> the html5 download attribute seems to allow this but i'd like some way to invoke it from javascript
[12:53:36] <jedimind> not a good idea to post code
[12:53:37] <ramin> but it doesnt work. but the strange thing is, that the error is in the response
[12:53:38] <jedimind> in the channel
[12:53:45] <ramin> yeah sorry.
[12:53:48] <mvp_graff> Has anybody used the ProgressButtons from codrops?
[12:53:54] <duckgoose> right datauri....
[12:53:57] <mvp_graff> hih jedi
[12:54:54] <astropirate> Is it possible to create image from the current state of the DOM?
[12:55:57] <duckgoose> nemik http://davidwalsh.name/demo/html5-download.php this may help you
[13:08:36] <ramin> okay again, without code. I'm trying a jquery Cross-domain call. It is a very basic page, just doing this call, can somebody tell whats wrong: http://diskordier.net/bitcoin/
[13:09:20] <ramin> the strange thing is that he says the error is in the resulting json response
[13:12:28] <shoky> ramin: adding callback=? makes it into a JSONP request, but that server doesn't support jsonp
[13:12:42] <shoky> ramin: it does support CORS though, if you add a cors=true param
[13:13:03] <shoky> ramin: so change it to:  $.getJSON("http://blockchain.info/de/ticker?cors=true",function(result)
[13:20:17] <ramin> shoky THX thats it. it works. but what does it mean?
[13:21:06] <shoky> `g mdn cors
[13:21:08] <b-ot> shoky: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[13:22:24] <shoky> ramin: basically you can only do a cross-domain ajax request from a server, if the server explicitly supports it. JSONP and CORS are two ways of supporting it. CORS is preferred, JSONP is a hack
[13:23:06] <shoky> ramin: and i knew that server supports CORS with that parameter because it says so here on the top: http://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_api
[13:29:56] <ramin> okay thanks. that info of "?cors=true" is not clear anywhere on the web
[13:30:39] <ramin> i mean in general
[13:30:55] <ramin> the server makes it clear :)
[13:35:02] <Whirl3d> This is gonna be a stupid question, but can you $.extend(deflts, arguments)   ?
[13:35:31] <Whirl3d> where deflts is a predefined object and arguments is a function arguments object?
[13:36:37] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d they're both objects so... sure?
[13:37:13] <Whirl3d> Just checking. the arguments object is a little different than most objects, I just wanted to be sure. Thanks I'll try it.
[13:37:48] <duch_kazatel> it's more that it's array-like, but it's still an object - you're smashing them into the first object.
[13:37:49] <krastavac> do you know some fancy javascript css front end framework?
[13:38:08] <duch_kazatel> krastavac that's... a big question.
[13:38:22] <krastavac> beside bootstrap
[13:38:54] <duch_kazatel> Foundation
[13:39:49] <sekyms> Is PhoneGap still the #1 html/css/js to native solution?
[13:40:38] <say2joe> simpler.com
[13:41:12] <say2joe> sekyms: try cordova (open-source version of phonegap)
[13:43:53] <sekyms> say2joe: thanmkyou for the suggestion, aware of anything else?
[13:44:05] <cankles> im trying to plot some data into a candle stick chart in highcharts. the paramaters are expected as [time, open, high, low, close] but i only have [time, volume, price]. does anyone know if or how highcharts can format my data properly?
[13:45:29] <krastavac> ill check those you mentioned
[13:49:13] <Whirl3d> Is there any creative way to extend a function so that it fires an action when the function is done. Kinda like a self-enclosed deferred?
[13:51:58] <terrycojones> Whirl3d: you could write a new function that wraps the original. The new one returns a promise after calling the original and arranging for the deferred to be resolved when the original function finishes.
[13:52:43] <Whirl3d> better yet, can I refer to a property of an object within the definition of said object? like    var deflts={targ:somelement, handler:function () {somelement.doSomething();}}
[13:53:00] <Whirl3d> drats. I meant (targ.doSomething();
[13:53:30] <Whirl3d> so that when I extend the deflts object and overwrite the targ parameter, it updates the handler function?
[13:53:57] <Whirl3d> terrycojones, thanks for the reply. Let me see if that applies here.
[13:54:47] <terrycojones> Whirl3d: np.  Also, you might like http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030508.do  (self-promotion alert!)
[13:58:24] <duch_kazatel> terrycojones apropos, I'm actually learning about promises right now!
[13:59:19] <terrycojones> duch_kazatel: great! Use AUTHD as a discount code on the oreilly site for a big (40%-50%) price cut.
[14:00:05] <terrycojones> i love deferreds / promises :-)
[14:00:40] <Whirl3d> terrycojones, are you the author of that deferreds book?
[14:00:52] <terrycojones> Whirl3d: yep
[14:01:16] <dijitaltrix> good morning everyone
[14:02:38] <Whirl3d> right on. about half of what I was just trying to do is covered in chapter 3 examples. Thanks so much.
[14:04:14] <terrycojones> Whirl3d: oh, you're very welcome!  i'm so happy that *anyone* is interested :-)
[14:05:10] <say2joe> terrycojones: that's a plug i'd promote
[14:05:24] <say2joe> good topic to write about (deferreds)
[14:06:09] <terrycojones> say2joe:  thanks :-)   there's a bit more of the back story at http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/terry/2014/01/07/learning-jquery-deferreds-published/
[14:11:04] <dijitaltrix> can someone help me with this issue, I'm trying to pass a value from a clicked element into a plugin but I'm not sure how to do it.. http://jsfiddle.net/7rD6v/2/
[14:11:56] <dijitaltrix> I'm attaching the modal plugin to every .telephoneEdit class but I want to pass an id when a .telephoneEdit is clcked..
[14:12:29] <dijitaltrix> but the model plugin code is called before the id is clicked so I don't have visibility of the id..
[14:13:57] <terrycojones> Whirl3d: all the book's code is at https://github.com/jquery-deferreds/code   You'll have to buy the words that go with it, though :-)   But the code should be pretty illustrative, I hope.   I'm happy to answer questions.
[14:14:20] * terrycojones brb
[14:16:17] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix still need help?
[14:16:37] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: please I've been trying for two days!!
[14:16:52] <dijitaltrix> I'm calling it wrong I think
[14:17:00] <dijitaltrix> but not sure how to proceed
[14:17:02] <Alex16> Hi
[14:17:27] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix what exactly do you want to happen?
[14:17:56] <Alex16> Can anyone help my i want to pass a variabe from a data- atribute called data-date I was told to us attr() but im a complete newb and I dont know what to do.
[14:18:18] <duch_kazatel> .attr('data-date');
[14:18:31] <Alex16> how do I call it in my html ?
[14:18:46] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 you "call it" in your javascript file.
[14:19:11] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 do you have jquery loaded on the page?
[14:19:11] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: In the example http://jsfiddle.net/7rD6v/2/ when I click on any .telephoneEdit class, I want to init the bsModal plugin with the data-id from teh clicked button element
[14:19:22] <Alex16> yea i do
[14:19:40] <Alex16> But i want to be able to use the variable in my html
[14:19:43] <dijitaltrix> Alex16 you can also shorten a data attribute to just data('date') too
[14:20:06] <duch_kazatel> err, data('date') and .attr('data-date') are different.
[14:20:28] <dijitaltrix> are they.. sorry for the confusion Alex16 ignore me!
[14:20:30] <duch_kazatel> unless the dom element has that attached as data, you have to use .attr() to access it.
[14:20:38] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix then you'll need to bind your click event to init the bsModal.
[14:20:51] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix but that sounds wrong.  one sec.
[14:21:05] <dijitaltrix> ok
[14:21:20] <duch_kazatel> wait dijitaltrix can you give me a full working example to play with?
[14:21:42] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: give me a min..
[14:22:08] <duch_kazatel> what is bsModal?  just a modal?
[14:22:14] <duch_kazatel> or does it do anything special?
[14:22:25] <Alex16> okay so i use atr but I still dont get how to use the variable though :/ basically what I have is a calender and for each date you click I want to open a bootstrap modal with the specific date so for each link i have a data-date attribute but now I need the date I pass from that attriubute to be in the modal I clicked so I can add aevents to my dat
[14:22:25] <Alex16> abase
[14:22:45] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 do you have a fiddle?
[14:23:36] <Alex16> well I dont think the fiddle will help much
[14:23:55] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 okay - how much code do you have so far then?
[14:24:05] <duch_kazatel> do you have the click event bound?
[14:24:24] <duch_kazatel> if so, just call $(this).attr('data-date'); - that'll be your data.
[14:24:28] <Alex16> <a data-toggle="modal" id="link" data-date="'.$eventdate.'" href="#myModal">
[14:24:45] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 that's HTML, not javascript/
[14:24:55] <Alex16> I know
[14:25:57] <Alex16> I was told id need js to call it
[14:26:05] <Alex16> or jquery using attr()
[14:26:11] <Alex16> i just dont know how
[14:26:28] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 do you have a script file included on the page to add your userscripts?
[14:26:48] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 sounds like you need to start from square one.
[14:26:51] <Alex16> what do you mean my userscripts?
[14:26:59] <duch_kazatel> scripts that you've written?
[14:27:09] <duch_kazatel> a file separate from the jquery one.
[14:27:20] <Alex16> well yea
[14:27:41] <Alex16> I have the bootstrap.js
[14:27:42] <duch_kazatel> okay - so you'd do it in there.
[14:27:45] <duch_kazatel> other than that.
[14:27:54] <duch_kazatel> a standalone js file that only contains your code.
[14:28:01] <duch_kazatel> your javascript, specifically.
[14:28:40] <Alex16> I cant just have a <script type="text/javascript"> tag?
[14:28:48] <duch_kazatel> you can, but that's messy.
[14:29:37] <Alex16> okay so then id have something like this? <script type="text/javascript">$('#link').attr('data-date')</script> right?
[14:29:47] <duch_kazatel> either way, inside of that, you're going to need do have a document ready statement - something like this: $(function() {/* your code here*/});
[14:29:54] <duch_kazatel> that code will do very little.
[14:30:09] <duch_kazatel> that code doesn't actually do anything other than read a value from an id.
[14:30:23] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't store it in a variable or anything.
[14:30:40] <Alex16> how do i store it then
[14:30:56] <duch_kazatel> var yourVarNameHere = $('#link').attr('data-date');
[14:31:11] <duch_kazatel> but that's still not what you want.
[14:31:17] <Alex16> Why dont I want that?
[14:31:22] <duch_kazatel> because you want to know it for the one you clicked on, right?
[14:31:23] <say2joe> $("#link").data("data")
[14:31:35] <Alex16> yes exactly
[14:31:39] <raj> When will jqui understand `box-sizing: border-box` ?
[14:31:48] <duch_kazatel> raj it does now.
[14:32:01] <raj> really?
[14:32:04] <raj> since when?
[14:32:25] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/16/jquery-1-8-box-sizing-width-csswidth-and-outerwidth/
[14:32:28] <duch_kazatel> it's apart of jquery.
[14:32:37] <duch_kazatel> so Alex16 - is that ID on multiple elements?
[14:32:45] <raj> jqui though
[14:32:50] <Alex16> well its a calander so yea
[14:33:06] <Alex16> I can put a unique id
[14:33:14] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 change that - an ID can only be used once per page.  use a class instead.
[14:33:15] <Alex16> by putting it by date or something
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> and raj - you'll have to clarify your question then.
[14:33:32] <dijitaltrix> hi duch_kazatel I've got a demo for you.. it's not perfect... you can see an orphaned example page, line 344 is the jquery bit I need to put the id of the element I want to edit, it fetches the required form from the server - http://iangrindley.co.uk/examples/jqissue/
[14:33:34] <Alex16> so i can put my id to be a variable no?
[14:33:54] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 you'll have to use a unique ID, either way. and I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[14:34:03] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: as I said I think I've got it backwards.. I"m still learning jQuery!
[14:34:04] <duch_kazatel> because you want the value of the one you clicked on.
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix let me look in a second.
[14:34:28] <dijitaltrix> thx
[14:34:33] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 your ID can be a variable in your backend, sure., but it has to be unique in the frontend.
[14:34:46] <duch_kazatel> Alex16 look at event handlers in jquery - .on() is a good place to start.
[14:34:52] <duch_kazatel> that'll get you started down the right path.
[14:34:58] <Alex16> alright thanks
[14:35:01] <Alex16> bye
[14:36:39] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix okay, so that line doesn't make any sense :) - do you have documentation for that modal?
[14:36:45] <raj> duch_kazatel, afaik, jquery UI's calculation for width breaks with border-box
[14:37:07] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of jquery, not jqueryui afaik
[14:37:18] <duch_kazatel> you mean $('selector').width();?
[14:37:34] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: yeah I know ;-) I made the plugin so there's no docs.. I just used a template from somewhere, it's just a wrapper for the twitter bootstrap Modal
[14:38:12] <duch_kazatel> mmk 1 se.c
[14:38:12] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel the $(this).data('id') bit needs to be the data id attr from teh .telephoneEditModal button that was clicked
[14:38:28] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix then you'll need to swap that on click().
[14:38:45] <raj> duch_kazatel, yes
[14:38:45] <duch_kazatel> that init will need to happen on click() - can you change out the source on launch?
[14:38:53] <duch_kazatel> raj that's jquery, not jqueryui.
[14:39:47] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel how would I do that?
[14:40:03] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: the bsModal has an on click event listner built into it..
[14:40:04] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix I dunno - you wrote the plugin >.>
[14:40:22] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to see which thing was clicked and get your data that way.
[14:40:28] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel I know.. I'm getting out of my depth.. it works great for a single element..
[14:41:25] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like your wrapper isn't doing what you want it to do.
[14:41:29] <duch_kazatel> why are you using it?
[14:41:42] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel you see the buttons on lines 220 and 232, when eithe rone of those is clicked I want to launch the modal and pass the id
[14:42:18] <dijitaltrix> because the modal has an onclick event handler in it I can't get it to work properly in this instance,
[14:42:42] <dijitaltrix> it's great for adding a new record without an id, but I can't pass the id into it this way..
[14:43:11] <duch_kazatel> you should reevaluate your plugin then and perhaps not use it.
[14:43:14] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like the issue.
[14:43:30] <duch_kazatel> you need to bind using .on() somewhere.
[14:44:02] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazate You can see the code for the plugin here, would you mind taking a look and letting me know who you would restructure it.. http://iangrindley.co.uk/examples/jqissue/jquery.bsModal.js
[14:44:09] <duch_kazatel> $(".telephoneEditModal").bsModal({ - that looks like an init.  'remote': '/backoffice/contacttelephones/edit/'+$(this).data('id'), - $(this).data('id'); is likely null because $(this) is not the context you think it is.
[14:44:19] <duch_kazatel> why do you need that plugin in the first place?
[14:44:30] <duch_kazatel> if you need to write a wrapper for a plugin, something very strange is going on.
[14:44:42] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: I'm using it as I have some complex forms with child records inside the main form
[14:44:59] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix but it sounds like it's causing your problems.
[14:45:07] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel it is..
[14:45:23] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel because it has the onclick handler in it..
[14:45:47] <duch_kazatel> i don't have time to read all your code tbh, but I'd abandon using it and without.  pay attention to things like 'remote': '/backoffice/contacttelephones/edit/'+$(this).data('id'), - $(this).data('id'); is likely null because $(this) is not the context you think it is.
[14:45:51] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel so how can I convert the calling of it to work on the .telephoneEditModal click event
[14:46:09] <duch_kazatel> dijitaltrix no clue - not going to read your whole plugin :)
[14:46:49] <duch_kazatel> i'll but that you don't want to built the remote url in the init like that.
[14:46:51] <duch_kazatel> *bet
[14:46:54] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel yes I know that bit won't work.. it would if I could pass the id.. I understnad you don't want to read it ;-) it's not that big.. I just need to know how best to call it?
[14:47:10] <duch_kazatel> no clue - that'd involve reading it ;)
[14:47:11] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: the remote is the way the twitter modal works..
[14:47:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to likely bind another .on() event handler that gets that data, then calls the plugin for you.
[14:47:41] <duch_kazatel> but i have no clue.
[14:48:23] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: yeah.. that seems right .. oh well..
[14:48:39] <dijitaltrix> thx for your confirmation.. :(
[14:49:06] <raj> sir shoky, you around?
[14:49:06] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confusing how $(this) works.
[14:53:30] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: I know I have an issue with scope.. I think I have a solution .. it's not pretty but I have a deadline looming !! thx for your help though .. it's appreciated..
[14:53:54] <duch_kazatel> all right mano.  in the future, i'd avoid doing things like writing plugins that are wrappers for other plugins.
[14:53:59] <duch_kazatel> but that's personal taste :)
[14:54:06] <petey__> Can anyone here critique this? http://jsbin.com/uYAGiFa/2/edit I want to add a certain class once I hit a specific selector
[14:54:19] <petey__> I tried using .toggleClass() but it would flicker
[14:54:44] <duch_kazatel> petey__ to start, will the value of var blueBox = $('.f') change while you're scrolling?
[14:55:00] <petey__> yes
[14:55:08] <petey__> wait
[14:55:13] <petey__> I mean it won't change per say
[14:55:23] <petey__> it'll always be $('.f')
[14:55:24] <duch_kazatel> move it out of the event binding, then.
[14:55:34] <petey__> ok
[14:55:58] <petey__> I'm assuming targetScroll should be removed too
[14:56:40] <duch_kazatel> actually, change the way you're handling that - cache the selectors.  you'll still need to recalculate positioning on scroll, but get the first part out.
[14:56:57] <duch_kazatel> even just $mypos = $('#mypos'); will help a little.
[14:57:06] <duch_kazatel> same with currentscroll.
[14:57:30] <duch_kazatel> basically, start with getting your selectors out of that scroll events.
[14:57:31] <duch_kazatel> *event
[14:58:24] <petey__> do i cache currentScroll or $('html') and $('body')?
[14:58:44] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing $('html').scrollTop() || $('body').scrollTop();?
[14:58:50] <duch_kazatel> why not one or the other in your case?
[14:59:06] <petey__> I saw an example of it somewhere
[14:59:31] <petey__> so I removed HTML because I figured body will suffice for what I'm doing
[14:59:42] <petey__> now I have var currentScroll = $body.scrollTop();
[14:59:54] <duch_kazatel> all right  update and shoot over the new link?
[15:00:05] <petey__> http://jsbin.com/uYAGiFa/2/edit
[15:01:18] <duch_kazatel> all right, here are some minor edits to your formatting; http://jsbin.com/uYAGiFa/6/edit
[15:01:52] <petey__> cool thanks
[15:01:56] <petey__> should i remove the brackets?
[15:01:58] <petey__> if its just one item
[15:02:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?  from what?
[15:02:45] <duch_kazatel> oh that if else check?
[15:02:55] <petey__> yes
[15:03:05] <duch_kazatel> i'd highly suggest not to.
[15:03:08] <petey__> Ok no prob
[15:03:40] <duch_kazatel> that looking better now?
[15:04:54] <duch_kazatel> oh, change that $body line to $html = $('html');
[15:04:58] <duch_kazatel> use html instead.
[15:05:23] <petey__> okay
[15:05:30] <petey__> is there a reason why?
[15:05:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/uYAGiFa/9/edit
[15:05:43] <duch_kazatel> because body won't work the way you want it to ;)
[15:05:49] <petey__> lol fair enough
[15:05:55] <petey__> why are your numbers increasing
[15:06:02] <petey__> im stuck on /2/edit but my new changes are taking place
[15:06:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm hitting ctrl+s i think.
[15:06:36] <petey__> makes sense
[15:06:46] <petey__> thank you by the way
[15:06:49] <duch_kazatel> np
[15:07:21] <duch_kazatel> the trick with the scroll event is that it fires a TON when you're scrolling, so you should do as much work up front as possible.
[15:07:23] <duch_kazatel> aaand he's gone.
[15:17:49] <dekiss2> how can I click element with jkquery
[15:17:57] <dekiss2> why $(aaa).click() is not working
[15:18:08] <dijitaltrix> duch_kazatel: you still about?
[15:20:13] <dekiss2>  onclick='$(aaa).click();' this s not working :(
[15:21:16] <krastavac> what js front end framework is this? http://teachingprivacy.icsi.berkeley.edu:8080/
[15:21:56] <dekiss2> my mistake
[15:36:02] <drager> How can I dynamically create elements and then when I create it set the z-index +1? https://dpaste.de/ViSq
[16:08:06] <grantoverby> Is it preferable, from a UI developers perspective, for a rest service (consumed by jquery) response with a not applicable field that is normally an array to leave that field undefined, null, or as an empty array?
[16:41:57] <cankles> anyone have experience with candlestick charts?
[16:43:00] <KWhat_Work> Is it possible to put FormData object into .ajax() data ?
[16:51:30] <sammych> apparently, adding a <style> tag dynamically will cause a FOUC
[16:51:57] <sammych> makes sense, doesn't mean I like it
[16:57:38] <GoSox> is there any jquery way to pause the execution of a script
[16:58:12] <GoSox> i have a script that starts running while the page is still rendering. i just want it to hang on for half a second before it starts running
[17:03:54] <GoSox> nevermind, my code was already sitting in a function, so using a quick and easy setTimeout() call instead of calling my function directly, worked perfectly
[17:24:15] <GoSox> ...it was very quiet in IRC that day... a little too quiet
[17:29:34] <talntid> Hi all. I'm doing $('#pdf').contents().find("html").html() to get the entirity of the HTML in an iframe.. works great.. but when I change the textarea in the iframe, the .html() doesn't show the changes... any ideas on how to make this work better? :)
[17:30:34] <talntid> I am changing the textarea by actually just typing in it, btw
[17:31:03] <duch_meeting> talntid are you adding text?
[17:31:22] <duch_meeting> talntid have you verified that doing the same thing outside of an iframe does what you're expecting?
[17:31:48] <talntid> I am adding text, yes, via keyboard. There is default text in there, and .html just returns the <textarea>default text</textarea>
[17:31:57] <talntid> it is the same regardless of iframe or not
[17:32:52] <duch_kazatel> that's probably about the implementation of .val() - it's reading the html, not the value.
[17:33:58] <sifu_> can anyone please tell me why this is not working? http://jsbin.com/oGoGuhIg/2/edit
[17:34:16] <sifu_> i am just trying to find the closest tr and hide it
[17:34:35] <talntid> right. I'm curious if on textbox edit... I should use jquery to rewrite the actual html
[17:34:56] <talntid> or something like that... or replace the contents of the the textarea on edit, or something? ideas ;)
[17:35:38] <duch_kazatel> talntid you'll need to parse the returned data and run .val() on any actual inputs.
[17:37:25] <talntid> any advice on doing so?
[17:37:42] <talntid> it's litterally one textarea I am working with
[17:38:50] <duch_kazatel> talntid can you just ge the .val() of that given textarea instead of all the html of the page?
[17:39:42] <talntid> I was considering doing just... $('#pdf').contents().find("textarea").replaceWith("<textarea>" + $('#pdf').contents().find("textarea").val() + "</textarea>")
[17:40:07] <duch_kazatel> talntid interesting.
[17:40:20] <talntid> Yeah, that seems to work ;)
[17:40:23] <talntid> silly
[17:40:41] <duch_kazatel> why do you need to do that anyway?
[17:40:50] <duch_kazatel> because keep in mind you're changing the html of that element and not the value.
[17:40:52] <talntid> I'm PDFing the contents of the iframe
[17:41:05] <talntid> so I'm sending the actual HTML to the pdf renderer
[17:41:13] <duch_kazatel> probably phantomjs?
[17:41:25] <talntid> negative, not familiar with that
[17:41:33] <talntid> wkhtmltopdf
[17:42:27] <duch_kazatel> if you're looking to do that, i'd suggest phantom - doesn't require the gymnastics you're doing iirc.
[17:42:31] <duch_kazatel> it's a full headless browser.
[17:45:38] <duch_kazatel> sifu_ your markup is invalid, that's why.
[17:45:48] <jedimind> pshh like markup ever mattered
[17:45:48] <sifu_> hmm
[17:46:00] <duch_kazatel> wrap that tr in a table.
[17:46:04] <tw2113>  you people use markup?
[17:46:11] <duch_kazatel> pfft it's the web go invalid.
[17:46:19] <duch_kazatel> that's why browsers fix things for you.
[17:46:24] <talntid> duch_kazatel, I'm basically displaying a html form... and when they are done, they click a button and it pdf's it and saves it in their account..
[17:46:28] <jedimind> tw2113:  yeah but not tags inside <body>
[17:46:31] <sifu_> okey
[17:46:35] <jedimind> i just use all my <meta> tags and display: block those bad boys
[17:46:40] <talntid> duch_kazatel, thanks for your help! I'll look at phantomjs. What I pasted earlier did work for what I was doing
[17:46:53] <duch_kazatel> talntid yeah that's just hacky.  good luck i suppose.
[17:46:57] <sifu_> thans duch_kazatel
[17:47:00] <sifu_> thanks*
[17:47:10] <duch_kazatel> sifu_ go brush up on your html :)
[17:47:30] <sifu_> yes i guess i need to but i was just fiddling around in fiddle
[17:47:52] <sifu_> and i guess the chrome console threw me off too...tried there...and failed
[17:47:53] <duch_kazatel> still important there, too.
[17:48:13] <duch_kazatel> don't expect jquery (or javascript) to be predictable if your code isn't valid.
[17:48:18] <sifu_> TypeError: Object #<HTMLSelectElement> has no method 'closest'
[17:48:22] <sifu_> that is what i got in Chrome console
[17:48:28] <sifu_> when trying on a page with the table
[17:48:35] <duch_kazatel> what do you get when you enter $
[17:48:50] <sifu_> function $() { [Command Line API] }
[17:49:16] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/commandline-api#selector
[17:49:18] <duch_kazatel> that's why.
[17:49:25] <duch_kazatel> try typing jQuery instead.
[17:49:27] <duch_kazatel> see what happens.
[17:50:07] <sifu_> jQUery is not defined
[17:50:11] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[17:50:11] <sifu_> jQuery*
[17:50:18] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to use jquery on a page it doesn't exist on.
[17:50:22] <sifu_> but doing this
[17:50:23] <sifu_> $("#frmdealer")
[17:50:32] <duch_kazatel> right - did you click my link?
[17:50:34] <sifu_> gives me the select box
[17:50:42] <sifu_> yes reading through now
[17:50:49] <duch_kazatel> that's a shortcut to document.querySelectorAll();
[17:51:02] <sifu_> ahhhh
[17:51:08] <sifu_> makes sense now
[17:52:13] <sifu_> thanks duch_kazatel
[17:52:26] <duch_kazatel> np man.

[18:22:01] <jphase> erm, idk about jsfiddle, but most sliders have that type of capability, nothing too fancy about it really

[18:55:27] <jedimind> if you give them credentials to log in, yes
[18:56:14] <jedimind> also its private, not secure
[18:56:16] <jedimind> there's nothing to trust
[18:56:20] <jedimind> private just means it wont be listed publicly
[18:56:37] <jedimind> not that its protected by a standing army on an isolated island inside a mountain

[21:39:01] <foxkit> Hello.  I am attempting to provide users with a modal dialog when changing the checked value of a radio button before actually allowing the check to complete.  I thought perhaps I could just change the value back to the original, and then if they confirm it in the dialog, set the new value there.  However, this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/awilfox/5LKVm/4/
[21:40:08] <foxkit> Obviously I've done something wrong here; but I am also wondering: is my entire solution here the wrong one?
[21:56:49] <shoky> foxkit: separate attribute selectors by putting them in separate []  e.g.  [name=x][value=y]
[21:57:38] <shoky> foxkit: http://jsfiddle.net/5LKVm/13/
[21:58:43] <scoT_T`zZz> foxkit: the click event is called first, try using that: http://jsfiddle.net/5LKVm/14/

[23:01:59] <shafox> Hi, I am having trouble with $.post. https://gist.github.com/shadow-fox/8312882 this is the code that I am running on my frontend application, but while post it says POST http://rest.api/login 200 OK 52 ms . But if I go to http://restt.api/login i can access that with no errors.
[23:04:09] <joroci> so what is the problem?
[23:04:57] <shafox> I cant capture the data .
[23:09:13] <joroci> i think you need to use done, not then
[23:10:13] <jphase> that would make more sense yeah
[23:17:03] <shafox> well did that but still can't have those data into my controller.
[23:17:54] <joroci> wait
[23:18:04] <joroci> the backend is not getting the data?
[23:19:43] <shafox> yes
[23:21:40] <joroci> what are you using?
[23:22:25] <joroci> did you see the payload for the post
