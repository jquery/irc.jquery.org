[00:00:18] <guy> it is more like a ff5 bug. it doesn't occur in FF3 or 4.
[00:00:26] <guy> though, I can't seem to fine any workaround
[00:00:35] <coldhead> it does!
[00:00:53] <coldhead> yeah i think the workaround would be for them to fix it :(
[00:01:16] <guy> coldhead: it does what?
[00:01:58] <LostyJai> it does seem hard
[00:02:05] <coldhead> thanks LostyJai
[00:02:13] <LostyJai> tell people not to use ff5
[00:04:36] <blackspotwiggins> guy, are you sure its not flash stealing focus?
[00:06:49] <coldhead> woo BSW with the lateral thinking
[00:09:45] <bobdobbs> Hi  guys. I'm having trouble getting this to work:
[00:09:48] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1271847
[00:10:08] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to alter the 'src' attribute of an image tag
[00:10:29] <cook1es_> in an if-statement if i want a joker character how do I do? does if(variable *= "pie") work, or maybe == "%pie%" or do I have to use REGEX?
[00:11:26] <bobdobbs> The point of my excercise is to get the images to download after the page has been downloaded. But firebug tells me that the 'src' attribute isn't being altered.
[00:12:45] <bobdobbs> One option I have is to use load() on the images parent, inserting an image tag that is complete with a whole source attribute, but that would double the amount of network requests.
[00:13:23] <bobdobbs> So, I'd rather already have the img tags in the markup, with empty 'src' attributes, and then write to them with attr().
[00:13:32] <bobdobbs> But I can't seem to perform that write.
[00:13:37] <coldhead> regex, cook1es_, JS doesn't have fuzzy matching
[00:13:45] <coldhead> don't be scared though, you'll be fine
[00:13:52] <LostyJai> the code you pasted edits the ID?
[00:14:37] <bobdobbs> LostyJai: oh crap.
[00:14:57] <bobdobbs> dang. Thanks for pointing that out.
[00:15:10] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, does any one provide me any tutorial site about 3d rotation logic in jquery?
[00:17:43] <LostyJai> bobdobbs: np
[00:22:00] <arif> hi
[00:25:27] <cook1es_> coldhead: do u have a suggestion for that regex? ><
[00:32:03] <jrockjiggz> sup
[00:36:15] <cook1es_> coldhead: shouldnt .contains work..?
[00:45:03] <mien> hi, where is a good place to ask about jquery-tools?
[00:46:56] <lanmower> is it possible to take html text and run find on it without adding it to the dom?
[00:47:43] <cook1es_> lanmower: yes, you can use .find on variables
[00:48:35] <theotherguy_> wts the equivalent of this for a textarea $('input[value!=" "]')
[00:48:36] <lanmower> and the syntax? is it var = $(html); then just run finds on it?
[00:48:53] <theotherguy_> $('textarea[value!=" "]')  doesn't work ;(
[00:48:59] <Paveloosha> @<lanmower>, I was waiting for you... can you provide me alink where I can find tutorial about logic of 3d rotation with details?
[00:49:04] <Paveloosha> :)
[00:50:31] <lanmower> omg
[00:50:40] <lanmower> no sorry, I'm not that far yet :)
[00:50:42] <cook1es_> lanmower: var data = "<div id="reply_area">hello</div>"; var quote = $(data).find('#reply_area').text();
[00:51:17] <lanmower> cookies, could I run a function on that find?
[00:51:27] <lanmower> and would those elements work with remove()?
[00:53:33] <cook1es_> lanmower: think so
[00:56:27] <blaamann> How can I define a function in JQuery than can be called in a page? For normal javascript I can link to a javascript file and then call all methods inside it, but how can I do this with JQuery?  This is an example of what I can do with normal functions: http://dpaste.org/OQ2p/
[00:58:35] <lxsameer> i'm try to use $.parseJSON but it seems that parseJSON is not defined, why
[00:59:13] <gurumelo> ?.parseJSON
[00:59:13] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[01:00:36] <gurumelo> blaamann: What has myfunctions.js inside?
[01:02:05] <tranver> hey guys, if I have a bug which already exists as a 10 months old ticket should I just comment on the old ticket or better open a new one?
[01:04:11] <lanmower> cook1es
[01:04:31] <lanmower> can you have a look at my fiddle?
[01:04:32] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/HyFDy/
[01:04:44] <lanmower> I've included your example...
[01:04:54] <lanmower> just trying to spot what I'm doing wrong...
[01:05:48] <janthony> Is it possible to get window.open() to open with code that you pass through to it rather than open a URL?
[01:06:12] <lanmower> like a blazing fast popup?
[01:06:18] <lanmower> lol
[01:07:21] <janthony> lanmower: Well I'm using AJAX to to build the contents of the popup.
[01:07:47] <lanmower> janthony I understand completely what you're asking, but I'm afraid I dont have the answer, never tried.
[01:08:15] <lanmower> it would rock though, a popup that already contains its contents...
[01:11:42] <janthony> Anyone know?
[01:11:55] <cook1es_> lanmower: sorry I don't understand how it works myself, but I know that it works for me ><
[01:12:27] <lanmower> cook1es_ I was trying to explain that your example isnt working for me...
[01:12:44] <lanmower> nor is mine :/
[01:12:59] <cook1es_> lanmower: all I know is that the source that I collect with $.get from another page is put into a variable and then I use .find on the variable.
[01:12:59] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/HyFDy/ check the bottom, thats your example...
[01:13:17] <blaamann> gurumelo: http://dpaste.org/mN9k/
[01:14:09] <blaamann> gurumelo: How can I do stuff like that in JQuery?
[01:14:20] <cook1es_> yeah that example doesnt work, sorry. I was told that the victim of .find had to be complete html or something
[01:15:27] <gurumelo> blaamann: $(document).ready(funtion() { alert("... not implemented yet!"); });
[01:15:27] <lanmower> oh? is there any discussions or documentation on the subject? I'd just like to know how to do it properly...
[01:15:44] <lanmower> and I'm having google block
[01:16:22] <lanmower> if I can get it running in a fiddle, I'm sure I can make it work in my code.
[01:18:21] <janthony> Figured it out: mywindow.document.write
[01:21:27] <lanmower> nice one janthony
[01:24:36] <blaamann> gurumelo: I am terrible at explaining what I am after. Basically I got some JQuery code drawing a map and doing some DOM manipulations. This piece of JQuery code is linked to from an html page using script src (should live in my services folder on my website). In addition I want the client side to call a functions that sets the size of the map as part of the embed code I will give to my client. (if this does not make sense, just ignore me)
[01:25:57] <mien> I try to make a slider with jquery tools and have some trouble. I got three li elements but jquerytools disables my next button when the page loads. What may cause things like this?
[01:28:57] <ussher_> Still stuck on this for the past few days.  http://junk.hostsaba.com/timetracker/  clicking on a time opens jeditable() and allows a time selection.  How do i make the selection cancel when a new time is clicked?
[01:28:59] <anli_> How do I get the visible height of the webpage?
[01:29:08] <anli_> I have found non-jquery ways
[01:29:16] <anli_> But they seemed ugly to me
[01:29:36] <blaamann> anli_: $(window).height(); ?
[01:29:47] <ussher_> anli_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/806402/how-to-get-body-height-using-jquery
[01:29:59] <Slartibart> What the heck?? I attach an change handler to a <select> element, and just for testing an alert should pop up. But in IE6 nothing happens. *Unless* I select another <option> and then press a key(any seems to do). Or if I keep clicking different options the alert pops up every 2nd click??
[01:30:08] <anli_> blaamann: That will also include the top of the browser, will it not?
[01:30:19] <anli_> like the address line etc
[01:30:58] <anli_> ah, I can read now that it actually is the browser viewport I get
[01:31:18] <blaamann> anli_: Looks like it includes the chrome too. Didn't know that.
[01:31:19] <lanmower> heres something interesting...
[01:31:39] <lanmower> I'm getting window.eval.call is not a function when running an append...
[01:31:50] <anli_> blaaman: http://api.jquery.com/height/ <-- search for viewport
[01:33:10] <lanmower> it happens in the globaleval part of jquery
[01:33:42] <ussher_> Slartibart: this any help? http://www.tillett.info/2008/02/06/work-around-for-ir-6-javascript-onchange-bug/
[01:34:12] <blaamann> anli_: Thanks
[01:34:15] <j_moore> Hello chaps - I'm getting an illegal character error in Firebug when loading the Google CDN version of jQuery. This seems to be happening for other scripts - local ones - too. Anything obvious I'm doing wrong or has anyone seen this before? Thanks in advance
[01:34:19] <anli_> :)
[01:34:32] <blaamann> anli_: You solved your own problem?
[01:34:36] <anli_> yeah!
[01:34:44] <anli_> :)
[01:34:54] <anli_> I often ask too early
[01:35:31] <lanmower> chrome says Object [object Object] has no method 'call'
[01:36:59] <blaamann> anli_: Asking or explaining someone about a problem often leads to own and joint enlightenment.
[01:38:48] * blaamann starts reading about JQuery plugins
[01:39:55] <anli_> seems like that
[01:45:09] <Slartibart> ussher_: Partly, at least. Thanks :).
[01:45:41] <Slartibart> It worked with the select, now I have to find a way to find which option was selected..
[01:48:58] <anli_> Slartibart: var selectbox = selectbox.find('option.selected');
[01:49:00] <anli_> oops
[01:49:04] <anli_> Not var selectbox, var option
[01:49:42] <ussher_> Slartibart: partly is sort of good.
[01:51:06] <Slartibart> anli_: Thanks :). My problem is that the select has multiple set. But I guess it's not a big deal to loop through the list and compare it to previously selected elements.
[01:51:14] <Slartibart> ussher_: Absolutely ;).
[01:51:34] <fr4nk> $('#selectbox').val();
[01:51:51] <anli_> Slartibart: selectbox.find('option:selected').each(function(){}9
[01:51:53] <anli_> oops
[01:52:01] <anli_> Slartibart: selectbox.find('option:selected').each(function(){ var option = $(this); });
[01:52:15] <anli_> But you can also have some more stuff in the function than just var option = $(this);
[01:53:08] <Slartibart> Jquery to the rescue. Thanks, guys.
[01:53:27] <fr4nk> $('#selectbox option:selected').each(function(){
[01:53:27] <fr4nk> alert($(this).val());
[01:53:27] <fr4nk> });
[02:00:19] <stefancrs> if I want to loop this animation, should I put it in a function and use recursion or would that eat memory? firstTickerItem.delay(500).fadeOut(500, function() { $(this).css("marginTop", 0); }).fadeIn(1000).animate({ marginTop: -distance }, duration, "linear");
[02:02:12] <gnarf> make that whole thing a function
[02:02:17] <gnarf> and make it the callback of the last animation
[02:03:05] <stefancrs> ok cool, thanks :)
[02:26:31] <SoftLight> Hello, How can I request a php like ... index.php?id=$value from jQuery and also return the value ?
[02:29:33] <jrockjiggz> php is server side, js is client side.  The values sent by url are processed by the server.  Js runs when the webpage is rendered.  If you want to pass values, you can set up a hidden input element, and then reference that
[02:33:09] <ussher_> SoftLight: sounds like you might want to look at the .ajax() function  and also perhaps the php json_encode() php function
[02:33:10] <ussher_> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[02:33:18] <ussher_> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[02:33:26] <ussher_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:33:50] <SoftLight> ussher_, Hi , let me tell you exactly what I want to do
[02:33:53] <ussher_> they allow jquery and php to 'talk' to each other
[02:34:18] <SoftLight> I have a registration form that validates all the fields
[02:34:44] <SoftLight> but for the email field I want to validate it only if the email doesn't exists already in the database
[02:35:08] <ussher_> yup, ajax would work for that.
[02:35:10] <SoftLight> ussher_,  here's the form also http://www.autohunter.com.au/register/
[02:35:13] <SoftLight> great
[02:35:14] <SoftLight> :D
[02:35:14] <SoftLight> thx
[02:35:15] <SoftLight> :D
[02:36:33] <ussher_> SoftLight: here is a description from the forums: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/check-if-username-exists-in-db
[02:38:19] <ussher_> SoftLight: and a demo: http://mix26.com/demo/already-exist/index.php  and a tutorial: http://beski.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/check-email-already-exist-ajax-jquery/
[02:39:05] <Anticom> hi all
[02:39:41] <djQuery> SoftLight: I believe the validation plugin has this anility as well.
[02:39:50] <djQuery> ?validate
[02:39:51] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation/validate - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[02:40:56] <antihero> Hi, if I have a link e.preventDefault'd, is there a way I can then trigger the link?
[02:41:02] <antihero> (ie after I've done some stuff)
[02:41:02] <nyuszika7h> ?down irseek.com
[02:41:05] <bot-t> nyuszika7h, It's not just you! - http://irseek.com looks down from here.
[02:41:46] <djQuery> SoftLight: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/remote#options
[02:42:15] <ussher_> antihero: could you save it to a variable, then call on the variable later on?
[02:42:27] <antihero> ussher_: Save what exactly?
[02:42:32] <ussher_> the url
[02:42:38] <djQuery> antihero: do an iff before doing the prevent default?  or set the window.location to the href
[02:43:48] <antihero> djQuery: I don't want to set window location because some links have a target="_blank"
[02:44:09] <ussher_>  window.blank.location
[02:44:11] <antihero> djQuery ussher_: The main thing is I want the browser to handle the link "normal"
[02:44:25] <ussher_>  window.top.location
[02:44:50] <djQuery> then just do your otherstuf then set decide to do e.preventdefault or now
[02:44:54] <djQuery> not rather
[02:46:08] <djQuery> $('a').click(function(e){ /*do stuff */ if (somevar){e.preventDefault();}});
[02:48:04] <antihero> ussher_: Hmm, window.blank.location doesn'#t work, and .top.location opens in same window :S
[02:48:27] <antihero> djQuery: Not sure how that helps :S
[02:48:36] <stefancrs> I'm running an animation with both fadeIns, fadeOuts and animating css properties. when I'm fading the element, I need to unbind the mouseenter/mouseleave events. how should I go about doing that?
[02:48:58] <stefancrs> I got a function prepared (unbindMouseEvents())
[02:49:29] <djQuery> stefancrs: see ?unbind
[02:49:29] <bot-t> stefancrs, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[02:49:59] <stefancrs> djQuery: that's not the issue, I know how to do the actual unbind. But I don't know how to call it when starting the fadeIn() etc.
[02:50:10] <antihero> window.open() sucks massively.
[02:50:20] <stefancrs> djQuery:  firstTickerItem.delay(500).fadeOut(500, function() { firstTickerItem.css("marginTop", "0px"); }).fadeIn(1000).animate({ marginTop: -distance }, fullDuration, "linear", loopAnimation); <- that's where it needs to go, somehow
[02:50:23] <antihero> as it's broken by most popup blockers and doesn't open a naturally new tab.
[02:50:37] <djQuery> or if you are trying to prevent the fadein fadeouts from getting qued up then just do a stop(true, true) before your animations
[02:50:39] <antihero> hence why I just want to trigger the event
[02:51:19] <stefancrs> djQuery: no, I want to execute the fades, but the thing is that I stop/start the animation on mouseenter/mouseleave, and I don't want to stop the fades
[02:51:49] <djQuery> ?hoverintent
[02:51:51] <bot-t> djQuery, hoverIntent | jQuery Plugins - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[02:52:14] <stefancrs> djQuery: hm, how would that help?
[02:52:41] <djQuery> .delay(500) kinda sucks
[02:52:53] <stefancrs> that's not for the mouse stuff
[02:53:19] <stefancrs> djQuery: that's for letting the ticker stand still for 500ms when it reaches the end, before looping
[02:54:08] <djQuery>  .bind('mouseenter', function(e){  var $this = $(this); if (!$this.hasClass('animating'){return; }})
[02:54:20] <stefancrs> awesome
[02:54:27] <stefancrs> that should do it
[02:54:28] <stefancrs> thanks
[02:55:09] <stefancrs> or, hm, can one check if it's actually fading?
[02:55:13] <stefancrs> because it's always animating
[02:55:26] <stefancrs> it's a scrolling ticker, and I stop the scrolling on mouseenter
[02:55:47] <stefancrs> but I don't want to stop the fading on mouseenter
[02:57:10] <djQuery> then has class fading. add the fading class before you fade. and remove it in the callback for the fade
[02:57:25] <djQuery> fading in or out?
[02:57:29] <stefancrs> both
[03:00:07] <djQuery> hmmm make it easier $('#container').delegate('.notfading', 'mouseeneter', function(){ do mouse enter stuff})
[03:00:32] <djQuery> then in the start of your fade remove class notfading and add it in the callback
[03:00:59] <djQuery> stefancrs: ^^^^^^^^^
[03:01:13] <antihero> any ideas of getting my event to trigger?
[03:01:18] <antihero> or at least delay until I say?
[03:01:55] <stefancrs> djQuery: should work, giving it a go, thank you
[03:01:57] <djQuery> antihero: ubind it then call click on it
[03:02:54] <antihero> djQuery: unbind it?
[03:04:06] <djQuery> antihero: to tell u the truth its 5 am here and I realy got no idea what u are talking about.
[03:04:57] <antihero> djQuery: Ok so I have a link that opens target _blank. I want to execute a $.get before the link is followed.
[03:05:21] <djQuery> antihero: goodluck.
[03:05:42] <djQuery> cause your no longer in the click event by the timne the get finishes

[03:10:20] <stefancrs> djQuery: I check for the class in the mouse event handler instead, works a treat. thanks for all the help.
[03:12:14] <djQuery> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[03:12:50] <djQuery> if you would do it with delegate it wouldnt even fire

[03:13:18] <antihero> djQuery: Thanks
[03:15:01] <antihero> I'm not sure it handles the link-following part, thought. It's a if that's in it's own little world.
[03:17:35] <antihero> Basically this would be simple as hell if window.open didn't suck balls.
[03:20:00] <mattcodes> is there a global ajaxPostFilter like ajaxPreFilter
[03:29:07] <hifi> soo, I've got a selector that isn't supposed to select these elements but it does
[03:30:42] <hifi> http://jsfiddle.net/52q4r/ soo, why does that selector work
[03:30:47] <solidus-river> hey all, i'm having trouble sending json data to a server via .ajax
[03:30:49] <hifi> that explains a lot of my headaches
[03:31:02] <solidus-river> i'm supposed to set the data field to the json string i want to send to the server, correct?
[03:31:10] <solidus-river> and then i use dataType as text?
[03:34:45] <solidus-river> {"url":"/api/user","type":"POST","data":"{ 'email' : 'test@test.com', 'password' : 'testing' }"}
[03:34:55] <solidus-river> is that not a valid post request?
[03:35:45] <callumacrae> Does anyone know of anything like this but released under GPL? http://thrivingkings.com/apprise/
[03:43:04] <hifi> shit, that was a rendering fail
[03:47:04] <logik-bomb> can someone explain me the logic behind this? [ var $this = jQuery(this); ] Thanks
[03:48:38] <sean`> logik-bomb: "[ var $this = jQuery(this); ]" literally that?
[03:48:40] <sean`> That wil error out
[03:48:47] <sean`> or do you mean var $this = $(this);
[03:49:06] <logik-bomb> sean`: 2nd one
[03:49:07] <logik-bomb> sorry
[03:49:21] <sean`> logik-bomb: jquery callbacks give you access to the DOM elemnt
[03:49:54] <sean`> so $('#foo').bind ('click', function () { this is the DOM ELement (document.getElementById ('foo'); and by doing $this = $(this); you create a jquery object });
[03:50:02] <sean`> so you can use $this.animate, or whateffs
[03:50:21] <sean`> So, it's the same as doing $('foobar');
[03:50:42] <logik-bomb> I see.
[03:50:47] <logik-bomb> thanks for your help sean`
[03:51:41] <kborchers> logik-bomb: What that does is cache the jQuery object for use later so you aren't parsing the Dom every time you need that collection again
[03:52:17] <sean`> ?caching @ logik-bomb
[03:52:18] <bot-t> logik-bomb, Even when you're creating a jQuery object out of an element you'll just be using once, you should always cache. Otherwhise you won't end up in heaven. http://blog.seankoole.com/qotd-why-should-you-cache-when-using-jquery
[03:52:47] <logik-bomb> kborchers: ha......

[03:58:27] <Paveloosha> Is it possible pto get tag name by jquery?
[03:59:31] <mattcodes> as a workaround to absence of a global ajaxPostFilter, if I monkey patch (as a decorator) the the success function in ajaxPreFilter that should do the trick rite?

[04:13:30] <Malediction> Paveloosha: You might need to do $("#myTag")[0].nodeName

[04:24:22] <purefusion> say I want to append all links of a certain class with the link's URL... is there a simple approach without having to use .each() ?
[04:24:25] <purefusion> or is using .each() the only way to pass the element to the callback so it can get the required data from the element's attributes?
[04:24:34] <sean`> ?next @ khurram
[04:24:35] <bot-t> khurram, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/

[04:32:45] <Shazer2> cos i hate getting 3 answers at once
[04:33:16] <codecab> we all hate
[04:33:48] <thinkster> I have a website template with a search bar.  Is there some easy jquery way to make it work
[04:34:14] <Shazer2> codecab
[04:34:17] <Shazer2> could you help me?
[04:34:24] <Shazer2> i've seen you being really helpful to others before
[04:34:26] <Shazer2> and giving good advice
[04:34:43] <codecab> i dont think so, but ask your question :)
[04:36:19] <Shazer2> alright
[04:36:20] <Shazer2> uhm
[04:36:26] <Shazer2> when i process a login
[04:36:35] <Shazer2> in check.php from a jquery file
[04:36:49] <Shazer2> i return user:true or user:false
[04:36:51] <Shazer2> to the callback
[04:36:55] <Shazer2> and it can only read that
[04:37:17] <Shazer2> if i want to check the length of a username a well, it's going to require 2 lines and will return something that it can't read and ruin both the username check and username length
[04:37:31] <mattcodes> thinkster, try $('header').searchify()
[04:37:45] <thinkster> mattcodes, really?
[04:38:06] <Shazer2> no lol
[04:38:10] <Shazer2> you need to code and learn
[04:40:25] <Shazer2> see, now i'll never know codecab
[04:40:43] <mattcodes> thinkster, on a serious note, you probably best redirecting the user offsite to use Google Search, e.g. the user fill in the search box in the template and on hitting-enter/pressing-button is redirected to google (but restricted to your site via inurl), jquery isnt the correct chatroom tho, try #html
[04:41:04] <thinkster> mattcodes, thanks
[04:41:25] <codecab> Shazer2: i dont get your problem
[04:42:42] <mattcodes> checking the username server-side?
[04:43:02] <thinkster> mattcodes, thats what I was thinking of.  But I was hoping maybe there was some jquery code already done.  But, I wasn't looking for a full fledged totally working search bar, just something for show
[04:43:04] <Shazer2> its so damn hard
[04:43:13] <Shazer2> to explain
[04:44:03] <mattcodes> thinkster, there wont be anything in jquery for that, you might be able to enhance a working search with autocomplete etc.. but you need to have a backend search solution first, something that can index your site
[04:44:45] <thinkster> mattcodes, I know what you mean.  I am gonna google for a something simple though.
[04:45:28] <mattcodes> unless its a big site just remove the search bar, all these template monster templates it mostly redundant, if your site needs search you probably have a working server side infrastructure to handle it.
[04:46:22] <S-Work> I'm doing $(this).parent().html() on an element of which I'm 100% sure it has parent elements but it always returns null
[04:46:35] <thinkster> yeah, it's my client, when I told him that the search bar will be removed cause it requires a database, which he didn't buy, he seemed disappointed, so I wanted to hook him up with a cheap version, cause as long as he sees it there, and it does something, I am sure he'll be happy
[04:47:42] <thinkster> How hard is it to include a real search bar?
[04:47:57] <thinkster> I guess thats a php queston though, or some other server coding
[04:48:28] <Woet> thinkster: embed the google site search?
[04:48:45] <thinkster> Woet, yeah you are right
[04:48:50] <Woet> javascript can't index your site
[04:48:59] <mattcodes> the search bar aint the problem, you already have that, my advice would be go back to client and define what his expectation of the search bar are (with the angle of talking him out of it), then say realistically with the various components it will add X days @ YYY per day, are you sure you want to precede.  yep google site search seems suitable
[04:49:16] <mattcodes> precede --> proceed
[04:49:37] <mattcodes>  expectation of the search bar --> expectation of site search
[04:49:45] <Woet> or you want to do fun things with sitemaps/ajax/etc thinkster
[04:49:46] <Woet> then it would work
[04:50:06] <thinkster> Woet, yeah maybe, not too fun
[04:50:12] <Woet> thinkster: this looks awesome - http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/09/google-powered-site-search-ajax-jquery/search.html
[04:50:18] <Woet> it's google powered and jquery
[04:50:34] <thinkster> sweet, look awesome
[04:50:35] <Woet> the code is at http://tutorialzine.com/2010/09/google-powered-site-search-ajax-jquery/
[04:53:50] <iaj> Got a question: http://pastebin.com/iamiFASB    can I simply put another line there: '_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/15/mehr-ueber-galal']);'  which is plain javascript?
[04:54:15] <thinkster> Woet, thx
[04:54:29] <Zeddy> anyone here who could tell my why the orientationchange is not fired in android when viewing a page?
[04:54:39] <Phil-Work`> iaj, sure
[04:54:48] <thinkster> mattcodes, thx
[04:55:39] <iaj> Phil-Work`; but that wont be visible on the FE right
[04:56:06] <Phil-Work`> iaj, hm? :S
[04:56:44] <iaj> I mean... normally I would have added it via an onclick="" event to that object
[04:58:47] <Phil-Work`> iaj, anything inside the jQuery('p{.moreabout').bind('click', function() { } will execute on click of that element
[04:59:07] <Phil-Work`> though I'm not sure what the { after the p is for
[04:59:16] <Phil-Work`> anyway, you can put any JS inside that function
[05:00:22] <_bart> If I have multiple columns using CSS3 like so: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/multicolumn.html is it possible to select one column and do things with it using jquery?
[05:02:07] <stenno> good, when using .animate, i know the start value, the end value, and the duration. how can i figure out the total number of steps in this animation?
[05:02:57] <stenno> for example, an element has the property left: 50px; and is going to animate to 0px in 1000 ms
[05:25:04] <wathek> Hi all
[05:25:51] <wathek> I want to get the img tag that are inside this  $('myelem').parent()
[05:25:54] <wathek> how can I do ?
[05:27:20] <iaj> Is there an jquery selector for any submit event (in this case from a input type="image") ?
[05:29:49] <fuchstronaut> iaj: you mean event for submit not selector, right?
[05:31:17] <iaj> hm.. yeah I need to bind a googletracking to when someone submits a form
[05:32:35] <fuchstronaut> $('input[type=image]').submit()
[05:32:44] <iaj> fuchstronaut; 10x
[05:35:22] <Shazer2> lol
[05:39:30] <gabrielc> hi everyone ..
[05:39:56] <iaj> fuchstronaut; http://paste.pocoo.org/show/438528  would that work?
[05:43:18] <mosez> hi
[05:43:45] <mosez> does an event like rendered or so exist? i need a trigger for the moment when an input tag is full rendered.
[05:48:40] <thinkster> Woet, hey, thanks, that was great.  I put it on my awesome.  Check it out at www.nadeemelahi.info
[05:49:47] <iaj> fuchstronaut; or do I need any other function?
[05:50:04] <fuchstronaut> well thats the event, i dont know what you are trying to do
[05:50:46] <iaj> I want to bind that _ga function to when the submit event is called
[05:50:57] <iaj> So when a user submits, call that _ga..
[05:51:08] <iaj> _gaq actually it is..
[05:54:17] <fuchstronaut> iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/438535/
[05:54:51] <fuchstronaut> submit events are called when forms are submitted, so you will have to select the form that's beeing submitted
[05:55:22] <iaj> thanks :))
[05:57:18] <icenine457> hello all, i have a question about traversal regarding the following code snippet: http://pastebin.com/P64uhttQ
[05:58:18] <icenine457> i think it could be related to "event bubbling", but im using an id selector on the element associated with the click event; what the code above should do is unhide the first div inside the parent div thats hidden. its currently unhiding all hidden divs (there are two other hidden divs in the parent div)
[05:59:41] <tiemonster> I want to be able to drag from my .sidebar to a .connectable, and then allow sorting. How do I do this?
[06:01:33] <icenine457> im trying to post the html/css now but it has template code in it
[06:01:56] <icenine457> anyone have any ideas though? ive been pouring over the documentation for :first, 'parent > child' selectors, and events
[06:03:44] <jeffsmykil> Im having issues where my script is jumping to an else after it meets an if
[06:03:46] <jeffsmykil> http://pastie.org/private/xbn6ncq2ddlnmqsuahdhg
[06:04:07] <jeffsmykil> after completing the if on line 20 it jumps to line 28 for somet reason
[06:05:47] <thinkster> is it possible to specity two selectors.  Ex $('div#one' & 'div#two')?
[06:05:58] <icenine457> $('div#one, div#two')
[06:06:07] <jeffsmykil> thinkster: only on a function if that makes sense
[06:06:19] <jeffsmykil> so if you wanted to click either one of those
[06:06:27] <jeffsmykil> but if you wanted to change a property it doesnt work
[06:06:31] <AxonetBE> how can I undo for example $('.tooltip').tipsy after a click on a link
[06:06:36] <AxonetBE> because unbind is not working
[06:06:46] <thinkster> yeah, just a funtion, hide()
[06:06:57] <thinkster> I can just write it twice though
[06:07:07] <icenine457> anyone have any ideas as to why my jquery isnt working?
[06:07:08] <Zeddy> someone tell me why the fuck jquerymobile sucks so much
[06:07:19] <Zeddy> they still haven't fixed the orientationchange event -_-
[06:07:22] <jeffsmykil> Zeddy: It's in beta?
[06:07:26] <Zeddy> people have been complaining for months
[06:07:33] <icenine457> Zeddy: because people complain about open source projects as opposed to fixing them?
[06:07:46] <Zeddy> yes well i have been trying to fix it for quite some time now
[06:07:51] <jeffsmykil> Zeddy:  im sure there are solutions you could pay for
[06:07:55] <icenine457> i didnt mean you specifically ;)
[06:08:00] <tiemonster> thinkster: $('div#one, div#two')
[06:08:01] <icenine457> just, in general
[06:08:08] <thinkster> tiemonster, thanks
[06:08:19] <tiemonster> heh - sorry. missed that.
[06:08:34] <icenine457> i said that but i didnt address thinkster :P
[06:09:06] <icenine457> maybe ill ask my question a different way: how would one hide the first child div (matching a class selector) inside a parent div?
[06:09:22] <ElGoorf> if you remove the Id attribute of an element, the CSS from the #id should stick right?
[06:09:35] <ElGoorf> or should all that get erased too?
[06:09:35] <icenine457> $(div#one > .hide).first().show(), right?
[06:09:36] <tiemonster> ElGoorf: no
[06:09:52] <icenine457> er, $('div#one > .hide').first().show()
[06:10:13] <icenine457> shouldnt that work?
[06:13:30] <ndee> when developing a plugin, what's best practice regarding CSS stuff? Should a plugin have a separate css file or is it acceptable to create the styles inline?
[06:14:16] <icenine457> id use jquery-ui as an example
[06:14:24] <ajpiano> typically better to keep it in a separate file
[06:14:26] <icenine457> ndee: which uses a sep css file
[06:14:30] <khurram> on a click of link i make all the checkboxes checked i want to toggle this behaviour so that on clicking the link again it unchecks the all please can some suggest
[06:14:34] <ajpiano> applying a bunch of inline styles via .css() === bad
[06:15:13] <ndee> kk, I just thought it might be a little bit a pain to include a separate css file when including a plugin
[06:15:27] <icenine457> ndee: i expect it to be that way when i use someones plugins
[06:15:47] <icenine457> that way i can get at the ui stuff easily if i needed to without touching your logic (on purpose or otherwise)
[06:16:24] <ndee> but when I want to set a style for my plugin, let's say I have a <ul id="foobar"><li>test</li></ul>, how can I get the correct ID into the css stylesheet?
[06:16:30] <ndee> ah, working with classes
[06:16:53] <ndee> always add separate (hopefully) unique classes to the element
[06:17:07] <roger_padactor> how does one debug plupload errors?  can't figure it out
[06:18:17] <icenine457> why would first() ever return more than one element!?
[06:18:21] * icenine457 bashes head against wall
[06:20:16] <dr0id> did it break ?
[06:20:33] <khurram> on a click of link i make all the checkboxes checked i want to toggle this behaviour so that on clicking the link again it unchecks the all please can some suggest
[06:22:01] <con_> hi all, is there an OR selector for jquery? like $('.even|.odd')   ?
[06:22:24] <Eviltwin> con_: Use ", "
[06:22:37] <icenine457> hooray
[06:22:39] <con_> d'oh
[06:22:44] <con_> thx Eviltwin
[06:22:44] <icenine457> i skipped the parent traversal and it works
[06:22:54] <icenine457> ...for the first one. :(
[06:23:29] <Eviltwin> icenine457: What's your problem?
[06:23:41] <khurram> how can i produce the toggle() behaviour for my click which upon clicking make all checkboxes checked and upon second click uncheck ?
[06:24:09] <groundnuty>  hey I'm looking for some html5 video player with support for "bookmarks" in the video. Like there are some colorful makrings on the timeline that rperesent selected scenes. Any suggestions?
[06:24:25] <icenine457> Eviltwin: i have 3 divs inside a parent div. a link with a click() event above those divs in the DOM should find the first div in that parent with '.hide' class, and remove it. the next click should remove the hide from the next hidden div.
[06:24:40] <icenine457> currently, its unhiding both divs, as opposed to the first hidden one
[06:24:49] <icenine457> http://pastebin.com/P64uhttQ
[06:24:51] <Xeon06_> Is there a jQuery approach to using setTimeout with a custom context?
[06:25:04] <icenine457> id paste the html/css in jsfiddle but it has Template::Toolkit markup
[06:25:44] <lanmower> so thanks for the advice everyone, I've started living without livequery as a crutch and the speed improvement is impressive.
[06:26:05] <icenine457> Eviltwin: the parent div is selected by an id selector so i dont think its event bubbling but i could be wrong
[06:26:35] <Eviltwin> How many alerts come up?
[06:27:06] <icenine457> with the code i pasted, two (BUT, if i alert the attr('id') of the element in question, its the first row both times)
[06:27:27] <icenine457> i think whats happening is, it removes the class, but then the next iteration matches the hide class
[06:27:39] <icenine457> so im removing what its using to identify the children of the parent div
[06:27:40] <Eviltwin> icenine457: Can you try adding a return false at the end?
[06:27:49] <icenine457> trying now
[06:28:17] <icenine457> still two alerts
[06:29:02] <Eviltwin> That means two click events are happening...hmm...
[06:29:04] <black_warlock> hello guyz
[06:29:24] <Eviltwin> You have this, right? http://pastebin.com/79QNvfAP
[06:29:37] <icenine457> correct
[06:29:56] <icenine457> which i thought i protected against that by using an #id selector
[06:30:30] <Eviltwin> icenine457: Could you try switching from a .live to a .bind?
[06:30:35] <icenine457> sure
[06:31:33] <icenine457> two alerts still :(
[06:31:41] <icenine457> i was originally just using .click()
[06:32:04] <orolo> icenine457: sometimes i'll need to do a .unbind().bind('click'. . .
[06:32:17] <orolo> to unbind a previous assignment.
[06:32:31] <icenine457> ill check but i created this element w/out any other classes or anything, it just has an id
[06:32:41] <Eviltwin> Okay, kinda weird but can you try: http://pastebin.com/cpFNQaYp
[06:33:13] <icenine457> trying to see if its the same call?
[06:33:16] <Eviltwin> Yep
[06:33:41] <icenine457> im learning from this - im trying to get us to use jquery/jquery-ui w/ our project since the people here dont even know javascript..
[06:34:11] <icenine457> Eviltwin: different rand result b/w alerts
[06:34:23] <icenine457> same id in alert both times though
[06:34:37] <Eviltwin> icenine457: That means the .live is getting attached twice
[06:34:46] <icenine457> lemme look around
[06:34:59] <Eviltwin> Is this code happening inside a function that gets called more than once or a loop?
[06:35:05] <__machine> is there an event to detect when objects are added or removed from the DOM at a particular location?
[06:35:44] <icenine457> its a link inside a jquery-ui dialog title
[06:35:59] <kborchers> __machine: no
[06:36:34] <icenine457> Eviltwin: so no, unless its in some kind of loop that happens in the markup for the jquery-ui title
[06:36:46] <icenine457> ill try adding the button to the inside of the dialog though
[06:36:52] <Eviltwin> Where the Math.random() is can you add an alert?
[06:37:00] <icenine457> sure
[06:37:17] <__machine> kborchers no way to do it at all?
[06:37:18] <icenine457> w/ the rand output im assuming?
[06:37:31] <Eviltwin> Anything, actually
[06:37:39] <ndee> is there a way to calculate with px? e.g.: I have a ul and I want to width to be a multiple of the li-count
[06:37:43] <Eviltwin> I want to see if your .live call is run more than once
[06:37:44] <kborchers> __machine: what are you trying to do? there's always a way ;)
[06:37:53] <ndee> s/to width/the width
[06:38:08] <icenine457> Eviltwin:  you got it
[06:38:12] <icenine457> i had included the js twice :/
[06:38:21] <__machine> kborchers im trying to add some javascript to adium that will detect when new chat msgs are added to the DOM, and automatically remove old chat msgs so that the page doesnt just grow indefinitely...
[06:38:34] <Eviltwin> icenine457: That's what I thought
[06:38:38] <icenine457> and that sounds stupid, but i use a perl objects method to render the js for common sections of our code
[06:38:57] <icenine457> so i had two calls to /it/ which is why i didnt think to look for an actual <script> tag :P
[06:39:00] <icenine457> thanks so much
[06:39:03] <Eviltwin> No problem
[06:41:03] <kborchers> __machine: hmmm, i'm not familiar with adium. you can't detect dom changes. if you will allow enough messages to cause a scroll, you could bind to scroll so when the list of messages grows, i think it should cause a scroll event to fire.
[06:41:22] <icenine457> now i have a question of a different nature: where have any of you found success in introducing jquery to a "legacy" project (one that made little (correct) use of javascript to begin with)?
[06:41:31] <icenine457> and what made it easier
[06:42:00] <Eviltwin> icenine457: I've had projects where I ripped the JavaScript out of an existing project and almost completely replaced it
[06:42:03] <Eviltwin> Not always with jQuery
[06:42:09] <Eviltwin> But at least I redesigned the logic to be better
[06:42:19] <__machine> kborchers that could work... but will that also trigger when i am manually scrolling back through the history?
[06:42:30] <ajpiano> icenine457: this is relevant to your question http://www.slideshare.net/garann/sneaking-structure-into-your-dombased-application
[06:42:40] <icenine457> nice!
[06:42:50] <icenine457> bookmarked, thanks ajpiano
[06:42:56] <icenine457> Eviltwin: thats what im doing, in peicemeal
[06:44:08] <icenine457> "you have a problem"
[06:44:14] <icenine457> tell me about it brother lol..
[06:44:31] <kborchers> __machine: yes, but if you check the height of the document for a length longer than you want, then you could only remove messages when the length changes. this is all just a guess though as i've never done it
[06:44:33] <__machine> kborchers would resize event be better?
[06:44:51] <ajpiano> icenine457: sister, for that preso ;)
[06:45:30] <kborchers> __machine: no, resize only fires when the size of the window changes
[06:45:33] <icenine457> lol true :P still hits just as close to home :|
[06:47:46] <borisrorsvort> hi
[06:49:14] <borisrorsvort> how can you bind and event wether a css.class is present or not. Knowing that the class will disapear without reloading the dom?
[06:49:33] <melusinechan> hello
[06:50:36] <melusinechan> how can i shut down an event listener ?, e.g.: $(".ui-dialog").keydown(function(event) { console.log('msg') }, i'd like to get only one time msg
[06:51:03] <kborchers> ?unbind @ melusinechan
[06:51:03] <bot-t1> melusinechan, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[06:51:15] <melusinechan> kborchers: thx !
[06:52:33] <melusinechan> $(".ui-dialog").unbind("keydown")
[06:53:58] <thinkster> is there a way to hit return on form text bar?  I have a site search bar, and I set it up to open a new page using php.  But I have a problem, cause when the new page open with the text box filled in with the data from the previous page, my search script doesn't run. I have to hit return again on the new page
[06:55:11] <dabear> if anyone from the us wantsa spotify invite, i have 5 available :)
[06:55:14] <dabear> send a pm
[06:56:48] <dabear> thinkster: var e = $.Event("keypress"); e.which = 13; $(soemelement).trigger(e) will trigger a keypress with the enter key pressed down
[06:57:01] <thinkster> dabear, thx
[06:57:04] <detrate> can anyone suggest a jQuery plugin for form beautification?  I was playing with formly but it has a few shortcomings
[06:58:37] <pomodoro> detrate: http://formalize.me/
[06:58:52] <pomodoro> its mostly css
[06:59:05] <lanmower> I want to select children that arent children of a certain parent...  ":not(.parent) .child1,.child2" did not work. Any clues?
[06:59:34] <detrate> hmm, formalize doesn't seem to do validation
[06:59:41] <detrate> looks pretty nice though
[06:59:56] <pomodoro> detrate: there's also formtastic
[07:00:01] <pomodoro> it's a dsl
[07:00:07] <detrate> sorry, dsl?
[07:00:07] <pomodoro> for ruby on rails
[07:00:12] <detrate> oh, I see
[07:00:20] <pomodoro> validation has an official jquery plugin i think
[07:00:31] <detrate> I have the ~pleasure~ of using php for a backend
[07:00:43] <pomodoro> ow
[07:00:52] <pomodoro> i use this for js validation:
[07:00:52] <pomodoro> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[07:00:58] <detrate> yeah, the jquery validation plugin is a fallback if I can't find a form plugin that does it all
[07:01:10] <detrate> previously I was using jQuery TOOLS but they are planning a major overhaul
[07:01:11] <lanmower> anyone able to help me with my selector misery?
[07:01:35] <pomodoro> lanmower: its the wrong approach
[07:01:48] <pomodoro> select the right parents and only their children
[07:02:05] <pomodoro> instead of the other way around
[07:02:05] <ndee> I have a <ul> element which contains 3 <li>. Now, when I click on the 2nd <li>, is it possible to get the index of that <li> in the <ul> element?
[07:04:31] <lanmower> pomodoro: I just solved it, I was trying to exclude by container elements that arent visible (the containers are hidden) but I've used the :visible selector now on them, works just as well in this scenario.
[07:04:47] <Hooloovoo>  ndee Yes it is
[07:05:27] <ndee> Hooloovoo, how? :D
[07:05:40] <pomodoro> ndee: index();
[07:05:42] <gym_jane> hi all
[07:05:42] <ndee> index() ? :D
[07:05:43] <ndee> ah
[07:05:49] <pomodoro> $(this).index();
[07:05:52] <gym_jane> What's the equivalent of .keyup() for a input of type number in jQuery?
[07:06:08] <lanmower> Any idea why this error may be popping up in firebug? Unexpected value align parsing preserveAspectRatio attribute.
[07:06:25] <Hooloovoo> ndee: http://pastebin.com/7EKHUBDh
[07:06:31] <Hooloovoo> there's how you do it
[07:06:53] <ndee> Hooloovoo, sweeeeeeeetness, thanks a bunch!
[07:07:02] <Hooloovoo> ndee: np =)
[07:08:15] <orolo> during an ajax request, i want to 'lock down' and actions on the children elements of a table and then reenable them on success. any ideas? (i mean, no clicks, hovers etc.)
[07:08:25] <orolo> *ANY actions
[07:09:17] <Hooloovoo> orolo: you could add a class then you start the request and check for it in your event bindings
[07:09:34] <Hooloovoo> like adding a class called "lockdown"
[07:09:45] <gym_jane> anyone?
[07:09:48] <kborchers> gym_jane: you mean the HTML5 input number element? i'm no HTML5 expert but wouldn't it still be keyup?
[07:09:59] <Hooloovoo> then checking your events with if($(this).hasClass("lockdown")) return;
[07:11:04] <orolo> Hooloovoo: add a class to the entire table?
[07:11:41] <orolo> Hooloovoo: oh, isee.
[07:11:49] <orolo> i have a lot of events.
[07:12:13] <thinkster> How can I make an anchor link perform this action: <input id='submitButton' type="submit" value='Submit' class="search-submit"  />
[07:12:43] <orolo> i was hoping for more of a "if table has this class" return false on all of it's children's events"; or is that what you're saying?
[07:12:51] <pomodoro> thinkster: submit the parent form
[07:13:03] <pomodoro> thinkster: $('#form').submit();
[07:14:37] <_Li> I've got a problem with .each() and trying to return false out of the function. Demo function: http://screengrabs.liambowers.co.uk/6d20d67e.png Any ideas?
[07:15:17] <thinkster> pomodoro, chaining?  So... $('a#somelink').click().$('#form').submit(); ?  I never did chaining before.  Is that how?
[07:15:54] <pomodoro> _Li: each doesn't have that functionality
[07:15:58] <pomodoro> use plain js
[07:16:18] <pomodoro> thinkster: loop up events in the api
[07:16:18] <orolo> ?chaining
[07:16:19] <alvarobsp> I'm having problems using .each inside a function to be called on javascript's onbeforeunload event, can anybody please help mem? Here's my code and some explanation: http://pastebin.com/hfYJDRVg
[07:16:26] <bot-t1> orolo, Tutorials:How jQuery Works - A basic introduction to jQuery and the concepts that you need to know to use it. http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[07:16:45] <_Li> pomodoro: Ok thank you.
[07:16:49] <pomodoro> thinkster: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[07:17:00] <thinkster> pomodoro, I see, yeah, like $('a#somelink').click() { ('#form').submit(); }
[07:17:54] <landypro> hey guys is it possible to use descendants in selectors with 'this'?
[07:18:02] <pomodoro> thinkster: not quite, take time to read
[07:18:08] <khurram> how can i make input:checkbox  to uncheck for specific form on my page instead of all ?
[07:18:28] <pomodoro> landypro: prob not needed, what u want to do
[07:18:36] <thinkster> pomodoro, oh, thanks for your help, I will get it
[07:18:52] <khurram> can someone please help ?
[07:19:00] <landypro> i have an img element that when click i want to change the src attribute
[07:19:05] <landypro> clicked*
[07:19:09] <pomodoro> khurram: u can check if its checked
[07:19:10] <khurram> how can i make input:checkbox  to uncheck for specific form on my page instead of all ?
[07:19:16] <pomodoro> khurram: just add form as parent
[07:19:43] <pomodoro> landypro: use the attr() methods
[07:19:45] <pomodoro> -s
[07:19:57] <landypro> sorry, not an img element, an a element
[07:20:02] <landypro> with an img element inside it
[07:20:09] <pomodoro> same
[07:20:12] <khurram> padomoro:   ('#link').click( ..... and inside i write .... $(this).parent('myformname'). ?? how
[07:20:18] <_Li> pomodoro, Can I somehow use the jQuery selector : $('input[name="foo"]:checked') then pass the results to standard js? (Unsure how it should work)
[07:20:21] <thinkster> so how do I code up a handler for an anchor link.  Ex. <a id='codeitmanually'>link</a>, and then in script $('a#codeitmanually').click(){...}?
[07:20:36] <pomodoro> _Li: yes, try
[07:20:49] <_Li> pomodoro, cheers.
[07:20:49] <landypro> so $('a').click(function(){ $(this img).attr('src', 'blah'); });
[07:20:53] <landypro> is what im trying to do
[07:21:07] <landypro> where this = a and img is the descendant of a
[07:21:48] <pomodoro> thinkster: use a function as parameter
[07:21:57] <pomodoro> thinkster: optionally use e.preventDefault()
[07:22:21] <pomodoro> landypro: cook up an example
[07:22:43] <kborchers> landypro: change that to $(this).children("img").attr...
[07:22:59] <thinkster> $('a#myformSubmit').click(function(){}
[07:23:06] <pomodoro> );
[07:24:00] <pomodoro> $('a#myformSubmit').click(function(){  $(this).parents('form:first').submit();  });
[07:24:15] <thinkster> pomodoro, sweet, thanks
[07:24:28] <pomodoro> $('a#myformSubmit').click(function(){  $('formid').submit();  });
[07:24:44] <ndee> is there a way to cut & paste an element?
[07:25:08] <ndee> got it
[07:25:10] <pomodoro> ndee: clone()
[07:25:22] <ndee> pomodoro, I gonna do it with insertAfter
[07:25:28] <ndee> since I don't wanna copy it
[07:25:28] <thinkster> pomodoro, wooooohoooooo, got it working.  Now I have one more problem!
[07:25:30] <pomodoro> (Y)
[07:26:17] <landypro> kborchers: $(this).children('img').attr('src') doesn't seem to work
[07:26:32] <kborchers> ?demo @ landypro
[07:26:33] <bot-t1> landypro, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:26:34] <pomodoro> landypro: use each
[07:27:13] <gym_jane> thanks kborchers :)
[07:27:20] <kborchers> pomodoro: why each?
[07:27:24] <kborchers> gym_jane: np
[07:27:25] <thinkster> I have a form pass data to a handle page for an input text box using php.  It works, the new page open and text is in the box.  The problem is my search bar program doesn't run.  I have to hit return on the first page, and then when I reach the handler page.  I have to hit return again.I am using this code for the search bar: http://tutorialzine.com/2010/09/google-powered-site-search-ajax-jquery/
[07:27:32] <pomodoro> attr is for individual element
[07:27:43] <pomodoro> dont think can use it on collection
[07:27:53] <gym_jane> do you know of any good banner rotators? I know most of the ones avialable on google search
[07:27:59] <kborchers> pomodoro: wrong, it will apply to collection
[07:28:18] <pomodoro> kborchers: nice, then it's prob something else ;)
[07:28:18] <thinkster> oh, I know, I will do the subit on page load
[07:28:46] <pomodoro> thinkster: :S smells like bad practice
[07:29:42] <landypro> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/LsgLv/
[07:30:16] <thinkster> pomodoro, probably
[07:31:14] <kborchers> landypro: i'm confused, it's doing exactly what you told it to do.
[07:31:27] <roger_padactor> anyone use plupload and get this error Error calling method on NPObject  using flash runtime
[07:31:30] <Anticom> i want to set the datepicker's date in an eventhandler to the actual date + 1 week... any suggestions on how to do that?
[07:31:33] <landypro> haha you're right
[07:31:47] <landypro> weird why it isn't working
[07:32:21] <kborchers> landypro: what's not working?
[07:33:18] <landypro> when i alert the .children in my actual example, it says undefined
[07:33:31] <landypro> but on the jsfiddle site its working
[07:33:59] <kborchers> link?
[07:34:18] <landypro> localhost :(
[07:35:03] <kborchers> landypro: can you add some more code to the fiddle without getting too messy?
[07:35:22] <landypro> hmm not really, it's inside an ajax call
[07:35:55] <kborchers> go ahead and paste that in there so i can see it to give me a little more context
[07:37:05] <landypro> kborchers: refresh
[07:37:53] <kborchers> landypro: you need to click update and send the new link
[07:38:09] <landypro> http://jsfiddle.net/LsgLv/12/
[07:40:04] <landypro> kborchers: it seems when the console.log is outside the ajax call it finds the children, but inside the ajax success function it cant find any
[07:40:17] <kborchers> landypro: yes it's a context issue
[07:40:17] <pomodoro> $(this).children('img').attr('src') == disabled
[07:40:22] <pomodoro> what is disabled?
[07:40:37] <landypro> disabled is a variable holding a url
[07:40:52] <pomodoro> ow, yes i see
[07:40:55] <kborchers> you need to store "this" outside of your ajax then refer to that new variable inside
[07:41:12] <thinkster> if I have two scripts, one.js and two.js, How do you call one.js inside two.js?
[07:41:13] <kborchers> so, do something like var that = this; outside
[07:41:18] <pomodoro> he's right, ur in window context there
[07:41:30] <kborchers> then inside use $(that)
[07:41:33] <sandropoadin_> /nick/leave
[07:41:40] <roger_padactor> this Error calling method on NPObject error is driving me nuts
[07:42:45] <landypro> thanks guys that worked :D
[07:42:49] <donCams> hi. very noob question. can anybody check this code and see what would cause the memory leak? http://pastebin.com/9NRZMQ0Z
[07:42:56] <kborchers> ?np @ landypro
[07:43:58] <kborchers> donCams: i have a feeling not too many people want to dig through 200 lines of code for you
[07:44:55] <bot-t1> landypro, No Problem
[07:44:57] <m0dmd> hi everyone.
[07:44:59] <tiemonster> Is there a way to determine the index of an element in a set without iterating and counting?
[07:45:11] <pomodoro> donCams: http://jshint.com/
[07:45:32] <pomodoro> tiemonster: index();
[07:45:34] <tiemonster> Like I know I can do .eq(0), but if I have the child and the parent and want to determine order, how do I do that?
[07:45:40] <donCams> ok... i have a cycle. and i'm calling the function load_attributes. and in that load_attributes function, i have var parentTag = $(".fpshop #window img").parent().get(0).tagName; would that cause it?
[07:45:40] <tiemonster> cool. let me try.
[07:45:49] <kborchers> ?.index @ tiemonster
[07:46:07] <kborchers> bot-t1: wake up!!!
[07:46:16] <pomodoro> kborchers: does that question come by a lot? :P
[07:46:42] <kborchers> pomodoro: what question is that?
[07:46:42] <tman> when using .val() in a validation function how do i chain in .trim() ?
[07:46:52] <pomodoro> kborchers: the index() one
[07:46:52] <tman> $(seletor).val().trim() == '' ?
[07:46:56] <bot-t1> tiemonster, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:46:57] <bot-t1> tiemonster, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:47:09] <donCams> pomodoro, cool thanks
[07:47:11] <kborchers> yeah
[07:47:38] <tiemonster> that should really be under traversal in the docs
[07:48:33] <kborchers> tiemonster: why is that? if you're looping through based on index, you're doing it wrong
[07:49:10] <tiemonster> you'll need an index when you're in the midst of other traversing activities
[07:49:18] <tman> 	console.log($("#subscribeForm input#first_name").trim($(this).val()));
[07:49:40] <kborchers> tiemonster: can you give an example?
[07:50:39] <tiemonster> if I have an element, and want to know its order in an element, I'll traverse to the parent and use that method to get a number
[07:50:45] <Skizu> I'm doing it wrong !
[07:51:12] <Skizu> Anyone help with a PHP problem ? ##php suck at helping so im here with the amazing jquery people :P
[07:51:15] <Skizu> http://pastebin.com/6XDwM3gi that's the error
[07:51:47] <black_warlock> guys im trying to load a page in a div
[07:51:56] <black_warlock> but it shows nothing
[07:52:02] <black_warlock> $('#main').load('upload/uploadtester.asp');
[07:52:06] <black_warlock> whats wrong
[07:52:32] <Skizu> Urg i'll make a cut down version :)
[07:52:34] <pomodoro> thats not how the function works
[07:52:44] <pomodoro> black_warlock: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:53:09] <pomodoro> black_warlock: wait, was too quick :P
[07:53:11] <thinkster> I am trying to call $('form#searchForm').submit(); for a page that is using this search bar script http://tutorialzine.com/2010/09/google-powered-site-search-ajax-jquery/ but it runs wild.  I need my page to load with data pass from php into my input text bar, and have the form input submit the form just once
[07:53:12] <kborchers> tiemonster: hmmm, but the only traversal there is parent(). after that, you're just getting the index, not traversing back to the element you already had, right?
[07:53:13] <pomodoro> black_warlock: srry
[07:53:48] <pomodoro> ?demo @ black_warlock
[07:53:54] <black_warlock> hum
[07:53:56] <tiemonster> kborchers: right. I'm just saying that most people looking for that have been recently doing traversal, and may be in that mindset.
[07:53:58] <black_warlock> im already on that page
[07:54:13] <black_warlock> and it reports the string i wrote
[07:55:04] <thinkster> is there way to do something like $('input#submitButton').submit(); ?\
[07:55:07] <kborchers> tiemonster: maybe. i see your thought process but it doesn't belong there since it's not for traversal i guess is my point
[07:55:16] <ajpiano> i agree with kborchers fwiw
[07:55:40] <ajpiano> there are a tonne of methods in jQuery you would call after having done some sort of traversal
[07:55:44] <ajpiano> that doesn't make them traversal methods
[07:55:44] <tiemonster> there was a point in time that I had the docs memorized ;-)
[07:56:12] <pomodoro> tiemonster: there was a point in time i knew all the pokemon by name
[07:56:27] <tiemonster> yeah, I would put those in the same category
[07:56:41] <kborchers> tiemonster: who needs memorization when you can ask bot-t ... when he's awake ;)
[07:56:42] <tiemonster> "things we thought were fun when we were kids"
[07:56:45] <ajpiano> ok so then it's decided
[07:56:50] <ajpiano> all pokemon are going to be included as traversal methods
[07:57:01] <kborchers> ajpiano: lol
[07:57:56] <SoulRaven> hi

[08:06:17] <Guest84218> I just started using the "Speeding up global event triggering" from the cookbook.  Now my events are not being triggered.  Has something changed since the book was written?
[08:12:27] <hopperfest> Anyone here use https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar ?
[08:13:25] <Moses_Foo> Hi,
[08:16:44] <molavy> no idea?
[08:21:07] <Po0dle> Is it possible to somehow fetch the amount of elements that were affected?
[08:21:38] <ajpiano> affected by...?
[08:21:46] <Po0dle> A selector
[08:21:50] <molavy> give me an answer?
[08:22:38] <nail_> .length ?
[08:22:54] <Po0dle> Ok
[08:22:57] <Po0dle> Thanks
[08:23:07] <molavy> my code is here:http://dpaste.com/568540/
[08:26:02] <nail_> what's the question?
[08:27:28] <AndyB> molavy, looking at your code, what is the problem?
[08:27:31] <mr_lou> I need a hint. I have a dragable div inside another div we can call container-div. When trying to drag my dragable div outside the container-div, it disappears. I'm still dragging it though, and I can even drop it on a dropable in another div. I just can't see it while dragging outside the container-div. But dropping works fine. I'm sure it's something simple I'm missing?
[08:28:21] <bobdobbs> perhaps overflow is set to hidden ?
[08:28:39] <AndyB> molavy, other than current is misspelled ;)
[08:30:03] <molavy> when i click on true button result() run once at first time i click on it , run twice at second time i click on it and ..
[08:30:28] <ajpiano> molavy, you are rebinding the click event on the "true" element every single time you call confirmbo
[08:30:39] <preinheimer> I'm trying to modify some existing code that navigates a tree with the keyboard. The existing code for up & down works fine, I'm trying to write code to enter a branch, but my selector returns differently and I'm not sure why. http://jsfiddle.net/hgmw6/ How do I get my child selector to return objects like the sibling selector?
[08:30:40] <AndyB> try live('click'
[08:31:58] <molavy> here is code in run :http://jsfiddle.net/uGEA5/3/
[08:32:45] <black_warlock> i have a form like this <form name="frmSend" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" accept-charset="utf-8" action="uploadTester.asp" onSubmit="return onSubmitForm();">
[08:33:09] <black_warlock> can sombody tell me how to asemble the string in jq ?
[08:33:20] <burrows> Im trying to make a tr clickable without interfering with any links within it. http://jsfiddle.net/JyV6F/ doesn't quite work. Clicking a link is fine, and clicking a tr logs out 1 and 2, but the click is otherwise ineffective. Someone help?
[08:35:12] <molavy> any idea?
[08:36:07] <ajpiano> molavy, on line 19, change .click(function() {  to .one("click", function() {
[08:36:50] <tiemonster> .index() keeps returning -1 when the selector contains more than one element. what am I missing?
[08:37:26] <molavy> jpiano,thank you very much
[08:38:09] <bobdobbs> How do I get the last child of this?
[08:38:26] <mr_lou> burrows, What do you mean the string? There is a .serialize function as far as I remember. Maybe that's what you're after?
[08:38:54] <burrows> mr_lou: wrong guy
[08:39:08] <mr_lou> burrows, Oh, sorry. :-)
[08:39:10] <mr_lou> heh
[08:39:18] <mr_lou> black_warlock, What do you mean the string? There is a .serialize function as far as I remember. Maybe that's what you're after?
[08:39:25] <ajpiano> bobdobbs $(this).children().last()
[08:39:26] <tiemonster> got it - mixing up child and parent
[08:39:59] <bobdobbs> thanks aj
[08:40:41] <johntron> can anyone recommend a library for rose/polar/radar/spider charts?
[08:41:08] <johntron> i've found rgraph and amcharts, but was wondering if there's something better
[08:41:49] <Moses_Foo> Hi, I'm using the selectable widget, and I'm trying to have it find an input box above it without specifying an id, so I can automatically have the input box populated with the contents of the selectable on stop. When I call stop, I'm not getting anything in either the "this" or "ui" objects. Is this abnormal?
[08:42:48] <bEEEeviz> before i start using it in the plugin i'm working at: is there a reason why i should possibly not use one() and use something else instead?
[08:44:23] <hopperfest> Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this? I'm trying to add an event listener to the button http://jsfiddle.net/FFzcz/
[08:46:31] <SoftLight> Hello, how do i remove the value of an input field with jquery ?
[08:46:57] <ryanneufeld> .val("")
[08:47:18] <dancannon> Hi, I am having issues with jqueryui resizable and draggable when the element has a container and I try to resize the element. It works fine if i disable the container. Does anybody know whats going wrong?
[08:47:26] <SoftLight> ryanneufeld, ... and if I want also to get focus on it ?
[08:47:34] <ryanneufeld> .focus()
[08:47:47] <SoftLight> thx ryanneufeld
[08:50:06] <burrows> This sucks. There must be a pattern for binding to clicks on tr without intercepting clicks on things within them?
[08:50:43] <misterm> burrows: could you clarify what you're looking for?
[08:50:44] <ryanneufeld> does $('tr').click() not work?
[08:50:51] <ajpiano> burrows: a) yes, use event.stopPropagation to stop clicks on the child elements from propagating and getting caught again on the parent
[08:51:03] <ajpiano> burrows: b) don't use liveQuery, use .live(), it's native and will serve your usecase
[08:51:21] <ajpiano> burrows: c) triggering a click on an "a" is *not* the way to get the browser to go to the href of that "a"
[08:51:45] <ajpiano> you have to do window.location.href = $("a").attr("href");
[08:52:46] <Whirl3d> if you have 5 divs that have content in them and each one has it's own initialization function, how do I access that function if it's named the same for each div? In other words: div1 has the "init" function, so does div2. How do I manage scope in this instance?
[08:52:55] <AndyB> Anybody have an idea why events aren't working in the second example of this code?  http://jsfiddle.net/Aw4f2/
[08:52:58] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: wouldn't triggering a click have the same effect? Or are you referring to using it with event.stopPropagation?
[08:53:05] <burrows> ajpiano: Thanks. Okay on the b). Re. the c) the intention was to be as unintrusive as possible, so if someone else had bound a click on that a it would get triggered, but of course the stopPropogation is knackering that :(
[08:53:11] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld, one would presume that, but it doesn't work that
[08:53:34] <ajpiano> burrows: window.location.href = "the href of the anchor" is equally uninstrusive
[08:53:42] <AndyB> This is taken from this web blog and the jQuery cookbook http://zendcorner.blogspot.com/2011/05/speeding-up-global-event-triggering-in.html
[08:55:19] <Guest3819> is it a way to detect when user scroll inside a block ?
[08:55:26] <gym_jane> can anyone recommend a very lightweight accordian plugin please?
[08:56:40] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that is very odd... I would have though that triggering the click would do it
[08:57:08] <ajpiano> well, now you know :)
[08:57:11] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I suppose it's cause your triggering the click event, bound to the anchor, rather than actually clicking it?
[08:57:17] <ajpiano> yep
[08:57:24] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/tccuZ/
[08:57:27] <ajpiano> like, if you have something like that really simulates actual browser events
[08:57:27] <ryanneufeld> I had to test it :P
[08:57:29] <ajpiano> then it'll work
[08:58:05] <ajpiano> that doesn't really show the behav
[08:58:21] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[08:59:18] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/tccuZ/1/
[08:59:31] <ajpiano> shows that triggering a click on an anchor from something else doesn't actually follow the href
[08:59:51] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/tccuZ/2/
[08:59:54] <ryanneufeld> haha, yeah
[08:59:54] <dancannon> Ok looking into the issues with resizing it seems to be caused by having aspectRatio and Containment set to true. Are there any known fixes?
[09:00:07] <ryanneufeld> very interesting behaviour
[09:00:26] <EDK> the video wouldnt load property on the div "showcase-content" http://samirayousefi.com/slider/

[09:01:32] <martco> seeing a "class" attribute but no value assigned in my element
[09:01:37] <martco> weird

[09:02:19] <EDK> http://jsfiddle.net/A6T2T/
[09:02:25] <EDK> here is my code...
[09:02:35] <EDK> please i dont know what is wrong on it...
[09:02:55] <ajpiano> martco, is your code happening after the dom is ready
[09:03:05] <gym_jane> can anyone recommend a very lightweight accordian plugin please?
[09:03:06] <martco> after document ready
[09:03:10] <ajpiano> yup
[09:03:13] <martco> ajpiano: yeah
[09:03:26] <ajpiano> martco, you'll need to show a live demo or smth of it failng, addClass works just fine
[09:03:45] <martco> yeah i know it works, it worked before but puzzled as to why this time
[09:03:51] <martco> maybe because i have other uls
[09:03:57] <kuroir> does anyone think this can be a performance problem for jQuery: https://github.com/kuroir/jQuery-Condom/blob/master/README.markdown ?
[09:04:24] <ajpiano> kuroir, uh, you know about jQuery.sub(), right?
[09:04:31] <kuroir> yes,
[09:04:38] <Anticom> how do i get the current value of an <input type="text" /> ??
[09:04:42] <kuroir> but I didn't use it because it's not what I really wanted.
[09:04:43] <ajpiano> yeah, i see that this is different though
[09:04:52] <kuroir> ajpiano: yes, it doesn't duplicate the object
[09:04:52] <ajpiano> Anticom see ?val
[09:04:53] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:04:56] <Anticom> i got [....].children('input:first').val();
[09:05:01] <Anticom> but that returns null =/
[09:05:27] <kuroir> ajpiano: you can override methods on the fly on a given namespace and still keep the global namespace pure.
[09:05:30] <ajpiano> that means it's not finding the element, not that .val() doesn't work
[09:05:51] <Anticom> but for the select fields in same <tr> my selectors work
[09:06:54] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/cjBZ2eYV

[09:07:54] <martco> <ul id="errors" class="">
[09:07:55] <ajpiano> black_warlock: check out the ajaxForm plugin, it handles the upload case nicely
[09:07:55] <keir> ?ajax
[09:07:57] <martco> so weird
[09:07:58] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:08:04] <ajpiano> martco, do you have more than one element with the same ID?

[09:08:22] <Anticom> <form action="foo.php" method="post" /> black_warlock
[09:08:24] <ajpiano> Anticom, what is $(this).parents('tr:first').children('td:eq(4)').children('input:first').length
[09:08:41] <keir> can anyone tell me how to initialise a loading gif when i submit a form with the ajax function while im waiting for the success callback?
[09:08:56] <martco> ajpiano: not in my html
[09:09:00] <gym_jane> can anyone recommend a very lightweight accordian plugin please?
[09:09:01] <martco> ajpiano: but in my css
[09:09:08] <ajpiano> css doesn't matter, css isn't the dom
[09:09:13] <ajpiano> gym_jane: use google
[09:09:15] <ajpiano> or jquery ui
[09:09:17] <gym_jane> i did
[09:09:18] <ajpiano> or roll your own
[09:09:22] <ajpiano> for mercy's sake stop asking every 5 minutes
[09:09:23] <gym_jane> dont want the ui one
[09:09:27] <gym_jane> ok
[09:09:35] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/pT6be/
[09:09:56] <black_warlock> i have to execute this via jq =(

[09:10:06] <ajpiano> black_warlock: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[09:10:09] <martco> so there's only on ul#errors in the dom
[09:10:11] <martco> one*
[09:10:14] <ajpiano> that plugin will create an iframe on the fly to handle the upload
[09:10:16] <EDK> please i dont know what is wrong on it... why doesnt the video wouldnt load on the main div
[09:10:26] <poppiez> what am I doing wrong? $('<div/>', { css: { width: '1000px' }); // 1000px isn't being set
[09:10:34] <poppiez> }}); *
[09:11:01] <keir> can anyne help me with that one please?
[09:11:03] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: do you know of a good non-flash based ajax upload plugin?
[09:11:07] <black_warlock> but with iframe its easy
[09:11:25] <ajpiano> black_warlock: right....so ... why wouldn't you use the ajaxForm plugin
[09:11:28] <keir> i want to init a loading gif or some sort of processing msg while im waiting for the success callback on an ajax submit
[09:11:28] <ajpiano> which does that whole iframe thing
[09:11:29] <ajpiano> for you
[09:11:35] <black_warlock> hum right
[09:11:44] <keir> how would i go about something like that?
[09:11:45] <ryanneufeld> bah, I should have read up... FML
[09:11:50] <ajpiano> keir: before the ajax starts, set the html of some element to be <img src="yourajaxloader.gif"> and in the success callback, replace it
[09:12:02] <ajpiano> heh ryanneufeld :p
[09:12:21] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: lol @ that last fiddle
[09:12:26] <ajpiano> yup
[09:12:30] <gym_jane> Aamir?
[09:12:51] <keir> ajpiano: thanks, i was just wondering if there was anything within the actual ajax function that you could initialise while waiting for a success / error callback
[09:13:03] <ajpiano> keir: there is a beforeSend callback
[09:13:05] <EDK> please help me to fix my bug.... on it http://samirayousefi.com/slider/

[09:13:53] <ajpiano> EDK:
[09:13:57] <ajpiano> you are using append ALL wrong
[09:14:01] <ajpiano> it's not like you are building a string
[09:14:06] <ajpiano> you have to build complete elements
[09:14:07] <ajpiano> you don't do like
[09:14:20] <ajpiano> append("<div>") ... do some stuff .. append("</div>")
[09:14:25] <EDK> <ajpiano>... since last 3 days..
[09:14:30] <EDK> i am maing it ..
[09:14:30] <urlicht> I have part of a form that I've put in a jquery ui dialog. When I click ok in the dialog, I want to clone the inputs back into my form tag so submission works.  There's a wontfix bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1294 that keeps the selectedIndex of my selects from being cloned over. Is there a quick way around this?
[09:14:36] <martco> ajpiano: i'm so dumb
[09:14:45] <EDK> <ajpiano>  i tried the way you are saying to me..
[09:14:47] <martco> ajpiano: i forgot the else after my if
[09:14:55] <ajpiano> bloops
[09:14:57] <martco> ajpiano: and the else remove the class
[09:14:59] <martco> fml
[09:14:59] <EDK> but my code doesnt work.. if i will do append("<div>") ... do some stuff .. append("</div>")
[09:15:16] <ajpiano> EDK, taht's because that way is WRONG
[09:15:33] <ryanneufeld> ?append() @ EDK
[09:15:35] <EDK> so.. how can i make it in which eveyrthing will be right ..

[09:15:59] <Anticom> :D
[09:16:17] <Anticom> why can't interpretes detect developers stupidity? =(
[09:16:35] <ajpiano> EDK: try smth like this http://fixee.org/paste/jce4eis/
[09:16:35] <ryanneufeld> urlicht: you'll have to get the indexes of the selects, and re-select them after you clone
[09:17:00] <urlicht> ryanneufeld: SOL huh... sweet. Thx.
[09:18:00] <EDK> <apiano> without using the last line ... $('.showcase-caption').append('</div>');
[09:18:16] <ajpiano> EDK: yes, you see i moved the closing "</div>" as part of the first statement
[09:18:23] <ajpiano> so that you are inserting two valid DIVS

[09:37:41] <bobdobbs> I've been wrestling with this for a couple of hours now.
[09:38:11] <EDK> having problem for loading div on the 4th thumb which has a video on  ...http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[09:38:12] <Whirl3d> in using slideUp and slideDown, my "collapsing" content is not sliding to the correct height. Any suggestions of what I should look for?
[09:38:17] <EDK> please help me out..
[09:38:17] <bobdobbs> the method "fadeToggle()" ends up being called for each element
[09:38:25] <EDK> it is sample code...
[09:43:55] <ndee> when an element has the width 100%, is it possible to convert this to a px number?
[09:44:00] <Whirl3d> bobdobbs, perhaps you should consider using a different classname than .hover for your elements. for me, not being the brightest mind you, it makes the code harder to read with ($(".hover").hover(....etc. I am not sure if it creates a technical conflict
[09:44:12] <cn1209> I'm trying to find a jquery plugin or method that would allow external pages or youtube videos to show as a popup. Any ideas or advice?
[09:44:51] <cn1209> tried several so far prettyPhoto and I get an error "Image cannot be loaded"..It's a bug
[09:45:12] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: Yeah, I agree. I should fix that.
[09:45:54] <Whirl3d> but then you would probably want to use $(this).find(".hover").fadeToggle();
[09:46:09] <bobdobbs> At the time I just couldn't think of a better name. The div is just for effects. Its not there by semantic neccessity.
[09:46:46] <Whirl3d> by using $(this).find() you are restricting your selection to just the event target and it's children (which find will locate)
[09:48:05] <bobdobbs> Ok. I'll give that a shot.
[09:49:01] <ajpiano> $(".foo", bar) is the same as $(bar).find("foo"), the latter being preferable, fyi
[09:49:23] <bobdobbs> cool.
[09:49:30] <Whirl3d> <--like I said, I'm not the brightest here.
[09:51:59] <roger_padactor> so wierd. im putting the plupload widget inside of a dialog and when it in there it doesn't upload files. same code if taken out of dialog works fine.
[09:52:01] <Whirl3d> anybody had any experience with google maps and sliding panels?

[09:59:46] <bobdobbs> Ok... so I figured out how to use .find(), and I now have this:
[09:59:50] <bobdobbs> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1271918
[10:00:34] <bobdobbs> But, I'm still getting the same problem: if I hover on one tab, every single $(".hover") fades in.
[10:00:40] <bobdobbs> What am I doing wrong?
[10:01:25] <bobdobbs> I'll upload the actual live code in a sec.
[10:02:27] <phlp> snapple is so good
[10:04:37] <phlp> almost good enough to be forgiven for using flash on their website
[10:04:53] <kborchers[A]> phlp: but not quite ;)

[10:08:38] <kborchers> bobdobbs: try $("#UI-container .tabs li")
[10:08:40] <bobdobbs> If I hover on one of the tabs, the "backlighting" for each one of the tabs appeats.
[10:09:37] <bobdobbs> aw dude. Of course.
[10:09:39] <bobdobbs> thanks man.
[10:09:44] <kborchers> np
[10:09:54] <bobdobbs> I wasn't being specific enough.
[10:09:57] <ries> Gents, good afternoon. I am using the tabs system of jquery. I want all tabs to be loaded using ajax (works fine) except the one tab that contain static content, for SEO perpose. Is something like that possible? When I define the content, it shows up twice for all other tabs (logically)
[10:10:52] <mr_lou> Anyone who has any experience with FullCalendar? I'm having trouble with "drop" callback, used when dealing with external drops.
[10:11:01] <kborchers> ries: the demo does exactly that http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax
[10:12:34] <ries> kborchers: going to take a second look.. I must have missed it
[10:12:50] <kborchers> the first tab in that example is static
[10:13:58] <ries> kborchers: I missed that, thanks... very usefull
[10:14:04] <kborchers> np
[10:15:58] <mr_lou> Nevermind, got it.
[10:16:56] <cn1209> Okay..Has anyone used PrettyPhoto jquery plugin?????
[10:17:30] <cn1209> I'm getting Image cannot be loaded. Make sure the path is correct and image exists. (this seems to be a common problem with no solution)
[10:18:22] <lenswipe> anyone in here know about ckeditor?
[10:18:28] <lenswipe> im trying to implement it in my web app
[10:19:30] <ries> kborchers: works perfectly
[10:19:38] <kborchers> cool
[10:21:08] <Hopsy> lenswipe: yes?
[10:21:21] <lenswipe> Hopsy, hi :)
[10:21:44] <lenswipe> im trying to incorperate ckeditor and im not doing very well - i had it working before and stuff happened, server crash etc so im having to do it again
[10:22:05] <lenswipe> Hopsy, that being the case, i cant remember how to set config items - can i pastebin you the code and let you take a look?
[10:22:55] <lenswipe> Hopsy, http://pastebin.com/FrvmX9dW
[10:23:21] <lenswipe> Hopsy, thats my <head> section - im using the jquery adapter but i cant remember how to set config options, the documentation isnt that helpful :/
[10:24:01] <Hopsy> you can check out the demos?
[10:25:22] <lenswipe> Hopsy, but they dont give you the code
[10:25:36] <lenswipe> brb
[10:25:54] <Hopsy> huh, you can view the source xD
[10:27:20] <orentanay> I'm in a situation where I'm limited to jquery 1.2.6, so with that limitation, how would you recommend I watch a div for contents changes, and then trigger a function? thanks.
[10:27:34] <gratnam11> how do i check  <a href="#"><img src="images/login-btn.png" width="103" height="42" style="margin-left:90px;" /></a> was clicked on
[10:27:52] <kborchers> orentanay: ouch
[10:28:00] <orentanay> tell me about it.
[10:28:01] <bobdobbs> assign a counter to click() ?
[10:28:30] <DroMastaP`Fr> Anyone here is using Aptana Studio 3 ?
[10:28:31] <gratnam11> bobdobbs() can u give me more details i am very new to jquery
[10:28:50] <kborchers> orentanay: although, even with latest jquery, you can't listen for dom changes. there is no event fired
[10:29:04] <orentanay> so far all I can think of is a loop that grabs the html and compares it to a previously grabbed html.
[10:29:37] <Hopsy> gratnam11: click function..
[10:29:50] <kborchers> orentanay: yuck, what is the ultimate goal here? are you changing the html?
[10:29:50] <k1t> how do i see whats inside a [Object object] ?
[10:29:51] <k1t> lol
[10:30:02] <k1t> like to inspect it inside an alert
[10:30:03] <gratnam11> how do i pass the value to php?
[10:30:04] <bobdobbs> gratnam11: Create a var called "timer". look at the docs for ".click()". Increment the timer var for each click.
[10:30:09] <Hopsy> k1t: google for dump in javascript
[10:30:14] <kborchers> k1t: don't use alert
[10:30:15] <Hopsy> ?g dump javascript
[10:30:17] <bot-t> Hopsy, dump() - Javascript equivalent of PHP's print_r() function - http://www.openjs.com/scripts/others/dump_function_php_print_r.php
[10:30:24] <k1t> Hopsy: thx
[10:30:27] <k1t> kborchers: i know, it's bad
[10:30:28] <k1t> :X
[10:30:30] <kborchers> ?alert @ k1t
[10:30:32] <bot-t> k1t, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[10:30:42] <gratnam11> why am i incrementing it?
[10:31:13] <phlp> k1t: use console.dir(obj)
[10:31:23] <kborchers> gratnam11: why do you need to know it's been clicked?
[10:31:24] <k1t> phlp: thats what im lookin for
[10:31:30] <k1t> thanks for all the input guys
[10:31:33] <k1t> and possibly gals
[10:31:34] <k1t> :P
[10:31:37] <gratnam11> i have a login image
[10:31:51] <Hopsy> gratnam11: you are taling to much lol xD
[10:32:01] <Hopsy> too *
[10:32:12] <lenswipe> back
[10:32:13] <gratnam11> i want to be able to check with php if that image was clicked then redirect the page to another page
[10:32:17] <lenswipe> Hopsy, hmm?
[10:32:29] <gratnam11> talking?
[10:32:39] <lenswipe> Hopsy, my web app spits out minified HTML - i figured pastebinning that wouldnt be very helpful
[10:33:07] <ini> i've used jquery a bit, and its ajax function successfully, but I'm getting this weird behavior. Im making an inventory list where a user remove quantities. The script moves through the list, and enters the ajax function if the quantity is > 0
[10:33:14] <gratnam11> someone please give me more details
[10:33:25] <kborchers> gratnam11: huh? you want to redirect when it is clicked? like a link?
[10:33:47] <ini> but, instead of going to the ajax when it evaluates, its finding all of the applicable items first, then going into ajax in bulk
[10:33:56] <k1t> phlp: I don't get any output in my firebug console when i use console.dir(obj)
[10:34:13] <k1t> (passing it my object, of course)
[10:34:31] <kborchers> k1t: it's console.log(obj)
[10:35:16] <k1t> kborchers: still nada
[10:35:16] <k1t> http://facebook.devoodle.com/
[10:35:23] <phlp> console.dir expands the object, like if you click it after console.log
[10:35:53] <gratnam11> kborchers, heres the whole detail, i have a php login page which checks username and password with mysql database, if the image is clicked, the username and password is correct, i want it to be redirected to another page
[10:36:17] <gratnam11> whats the easiest way to achieve this?
[10:36:44] <k1t> at the bottom of my code, you can see an alert(data) which pops up "[object object]" but then if i do a console.log(data) or console.dir(data), i dont get anything in console
[10:36:54] <k1t> @ facebook.devoodle.com that i s
[10:36:58] <bobdobbs> gratnam11: you might want to break that taskset down into parts for a start.
[10:37:37] <thinkster> anyone know about search engines.  If I google www.flavourofhimalaya.com, I see the site.  but if I goto http://www.google.com/sitesearch/ and I search www.flavourofhimalaya.com
[10:37:50] <Bubbi> \j #jquery-dev
[10:38:13] <Bubbi> argh dammit, can never remember if it's forward or backslash :-)
[10:38:28] <gratnam11> okay i want to check if the image is clicked thats the first part, how do i do this?
[10:38:44] <gratnam11> i saw this when googling
[10:38:48] <gratnam11> <input type="image" src="rainbow.gif" name="image" width="60" height="60">
[10:38:53] <gratnam11> would that work?
[10:38:59] <bobdobbs> gratnam11: use .click()
[10:39:03] <kborchers> gratnam11: but why do you need to know if it was clicked? what will you do with that information?
[10:39:38] <gratnam11> i want php to do a select and then check if the usernames and passwords are correct
[10:40:03] <bobdobbs> I think you might be missing tasks in your chain
[10:40:07] <phlp> k1t: you have myCallback defined twice, the last one has only the alert
[10:40:26] <nail_> Are you trying to prevent bots from submitting or something?
[10:40:34] <gratnam11> can you telling me what i am missing
[10:41:03] <bobdobbs> choosing a way to pass the info back to the server, and security.
[10:41:23] <bobdobbs> Will you be encrypting the connection between server and host?
[10:41:33] <bobdobbs> Will you be sending cleartext?
[10:41:52] <gratnam11> i want to get it working with cleartext first
[10:42:00] <bobdobbs> right
[10:42:15] <gratnam11> and then i am going to encrypt the password with mysql, i think theres a method in php to do that
[10:42:22] <kborchers> gratnam11: ok, so what does that have to do with jquery? the image will post the form, you handle the post server side. no jquery necessary
[10:42:37] <gratnam11> oh okay, i wasn't sure
[10:42:55] <bobdobbs> you will have to consider encryption on the channel as well. Not just your server.
[10:42:56] <gratnam11> let me try it with out query, php referred me to here
[10:43:10] <gratnam11> channel?
[10:43:16] <gratnam11> u mean using like ssl or something?
[10:43:36] <bobdobbs> Your choice of protection against xss might effect the way you get the info you want and send it back. Another thing to consider.
[10:44:30] <bobdobbs> Yeah, I meant channel of comunication between server and browser.
[10:44:58] <gratnam11> i am tainting the variables with php
[10:45:35] <gratnam11> i don't know too much about xss
[10:45:52] <gratnam11> can your server still be attacked even if your tainting your variables?
[10:46:16] <bobdobbs> I'm still learning about xss myself.
[10:47:06] <wrld> hello
[10:47:11] <Cagelin> hi
[10:47:47] <bobdobbs> But I was looking at passing data from the client to the server. The client data wasn't sensitive, but I was using ajax requests.
[10:48:06] <bobdobbs> I eventually figured out that this opened a path to xss attacks.
[10:49:33] <PhanLord> is there a way to close all jquery-ui dialogs at once ?
[10:50:43] <PhanLord> tried somethign like this $('.ui-dialog').dialog("close") but it did no have any effect
[10:50:59] <kborchers> PhanLord: i believe you can do $("selector that gets all of your dialogs").dialog("close");
[10:51:20] <kborchers> PhanLord: that selector needs to be the original divs or what ever you used to create the dialogs
[10:52:09] <PhanLord> uff :( that sux i did nto want to keep track of whats open :( just close whatever it is :(
[10:53:13] <nail_> PhanLord: $('.ui-dialog-content').dialog("close")
[10:53:42] <thinkster> if I search on google.com "mattress site:nadeemelahi.info" I get a result but then if I go to http://www.google.com/sitesearch/ and do the same search or even blank search, I get nothing

[11:57:45] <atriv> Hey all, if I've used jQuery to add options to a select (a dropdown) how can i access the values in that field when the form posts?
[11:58:26] <AG> atriv, you
[11:58:33] <AG> hold on
[11:58:35] <phlp> gratnam11: you used '#click' but you added class="click" to the image. either change class to id or use $('.click')
[11:59:01] <AG> How are you submitting the form?
[11:59:07] <AG> jQuery .post?
[11:59:10] <gratnam11> yeah i changed it to id="click"
[11:59:13] <gratnam11> still doesn't work
[11:59:40] <atriv> no, standard form procedure
[11:59:44] <atriv> most of the form is standard html
[11:59:59] <atriv> and then i needed to dynamically populate values for the dropdown
[12:00:02] <atriv> so i used jquery
[12:00:13] <atriv> i guess id have to do the whole form in jquery?
[12:00:18] <phlp> gratnam11: the code is gone now?
[12:00:27] <gratnam11> gone?
[12:00:31] <gratnam11> i moved it to body
[12:00:36] <NemesisD> hey guys. i'm wondering if i can explicitly execute an event. i want to catch a form submit, do something asynchronously and in the callback, continue bubbling/doing what that event was going to do
[12:00:39] <gratnam11> is it suppose to be in header?
[12:00:44] <gratnam11> i mean head
[12:00:50] <AG> no, what you're doing should be ok. What I think you're having a problem with is grabbing the value on the other end.
[12:01:02] <atriv> correct
[12:01:11] <gratnam11> i have $test=$_POST['id'];
[12:01:11] <NemesisD> would i have to create a new event or something?
[12:01:17] <gratnam11> and i do echo $test;
[12:01:21] <gratnam11> nothing shows up
[12:01:26] <AG> Where is the form submitting? To a .html document?
[12:01:41] <NemesisD> AG: to an action on a server
[12:01:45] <gratnam11> to the same page
[12:01:48] <gratnam11> index.php
[12:01:51] <NemesisD> oh you weren't talking to me lol
[12:02:13] <atriv> its submitting to an html document technically. im working with a python micro framework -- python
[12:02:15] <AG> Sorry dude, nope. I need to specify who I'm replying to haha
[12:02:16] <atriv> flask*
[12:03:03] <gratnam11> query seems so hard lol
[12:03:16] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/UNFKVHVK -- help with this
[12:03:39] <swiggy> i am trying to load the CSS from the selected URL thats being loaded via colorbox (the pastebin)
[12:03:52] <swiggy> but it instead uses "my" css
[12:04:06] <AG> atriv: sorry, I don't know Python, but does link describe a possible solution for you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/464040/how-are-post-and-get-variables-handled-in-python
[12:04:20] <tjholowaychuk> .css(prop, undefined) returns the prop value...
[12:04:27] <tjholowaychuk> is this a known bug?
[12:04:35] <gratnam11> would it help if i use (document).ready
[12:04:39] <gratnam11> ?
[12:04:50] <testify> Is there is a way to prevent an item from being deselected when the mouse leaves an autocomplete menu?
[12:05:22] <atriv> AG: yeah, im able to get all my form values except those elements created by jquery
[12:05:45] <dekozo__> is there any plugins or any way to do a hover on a image and embed a menu on the hover? i mean, i pass the mouse over an image and some buttons appear?
[12:06:20] <gratnam11> so what do i have to do to get the .click function to work?
[12:06:43] <Moses_> Hi, I'm trying to write my jquery-ui selectable code such that it doesn't need any ids to work. My page is attempting to add selectable elements dynamically through javascript, so I can't list ids in my code. I'm completely stuck, anyone have any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/wf5QJ/23/
[12:06:58] <atriv> can jquery submit form values in a standard "post"?
[12:07:08] <ceej> anyone here use jquery template?
[12:07:31] <Parserror> anyone know how I can get this http://pastie.org/2213742 to fire an ajax:success function(event, data, status, xhr) { $("#my_div").html(data) }); when the submit completes?
[12:07:37] <NemesisD> or perhaps a more direct question: how would one cause a form to be submitted without firing all the form submit event (and thus causing an infinite recursion problem)
[12:07:50] <ceej> is there a param to change the  {{}} to something different?
[12:08:02] <ceej> like <%%> instead
[12:08:20] <ceej> if not I'll just change the regex
[12:09:05] <AG> atriv: hold on, I'm writing something for you that might do what you need
[12:09:11] <luchenbill> does anyone have any issues with ie9 and the jquery ui?
[12:09:13] <tjholowaychuk> .css(prop, undefined) returns the prop value...   anyone?
[12:09:18] <luchenbill> i'm having an issue right now the the slider
[12:09:21] <atriv> AG: ah, ok... thanks much
[12:09:33] <kborchers> luchenbill: what issue?
[12:09:43] <Parserror> tjholowaychuk: is that what the API says?
[12:10:03] <luchenbill> the issue is that I can't click the slider, if you click on it, it highlights but nothing happens
[12:10:12] <tjholowaychuk> i dont know. is an arity check not possible with IE or something?
[12:10:13] <luchenbill> if you use the keyboard arrow keys it works
[12:10:20] <ceej> I just changed the regex
[12:10:20] <Parserror> tjholowaychuk: looks like if you just do .css(property) then it returns the value
[12:10:22] <kborchers> ?demo @ luchenbill
[12:10:23] <bot-t> luchenbill, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:10:23] <luchenbill> or if you click in the slider pace to the left or right it works
[12:10:37] <tjholowaychuk> Parserror yeah, but when you intend on changing the value
[12:10:41] <tjholowaychuk> it shouldn't return the val
[12:10:44] <ceej> looks to me like he should make it a param for someone without regex knowlage to change :)
[12:10:44] <jtrally> property,undefined should be equivalent
[12:10:45] <tjholowaychuk> it should chain
[12:11:00] <Parserror> tjholowaychuk: try .prop()
[12:11:19] <tjholowaychuk> i'll open a ticket
[12:12:14] <gratnam11> can someone tell me how to pass a variable to post when a variable is clicked
[12:12:19] <gratnam11> sorry
[12:12:23] <gratnam11> when a image is clicked
[12:12:25] <Parserror> anyways, anyone willing to answer an AJAX question?
[12:12:56] <Parserror> gratnam11: you mean submit a form via POST?
[12:13:03] <kborchers> tjholowaychuk: that isn't a bug. you shouldn't be passing undefined to css.
[12:13:11] <gym_jane_> Aamir?
[12:13:23] <tjholowaychuk> kborchers: sure, but if your intention is to change the value, it should return for chaining
[12:13:25] <tjholowaychuk> like it does otherwise
[12:13:30] <tjholowaychuk> that's a bug
[12:13:45] <Moses_> Hi, I'm trying to write my jquery-ui selectable code such that it doesn't need any ids to work. My page is attempting to add selectable elements dynamically through javascript, so I can't list ids in my code.  I want to use classes and dom traversal with parent and closest methods to do this http://jsfiddle.net/wf5QJ/23/
[12:13:49] <AG> atriv: look that over and see if you can work with it. It's very simple, it is executing the code after the form submit button is clicked, then it assigns the form values to Javascript values, then submits those using the jQuery .post method. http://pastebin.com/q2EC3nxu
[12:14:27] <AG> On your form leave the action command blank, like <form method="post" action="">
[12:14:32] <swiggy> is anyone familiar with colorbox?
[12:14:37] <gratnam11> Parserror, i have a image, that i want it to pass a variable to post, so i can check with php
[12:14:44] <Moses_> I'm currently stuck on just getting a selectable to work using a class selector rather than id. It works fine with an id, but if I try $('a_class').each(function(){  $(this).selectable()... I'm hosed again =\
[12:14:44] <t4nkd> How would I execute an anchor containing an ID -- .click() doesn't seem to change the document position for my page
[12:14:46] <swiggy> http://pastebin.com/UNFKVHVK -- help with this if you are
[12:15:24] <atriv> AG:  thanks a bunch. ill have a look
[12:15:34] <Ogredude> crap
[12:15:41] <swiggy> i want the page that i am loading with colorbox - i want colorbox to preserve the CSS
[12:15:44] <codecab> Moses_: $('a_class') selects all nodes of type a_class
[12:16:11] <Moses_> Sorry codecab, that was a type, I'm doign $('.a_class')
[12:16:13] <Ogredude> I think I need to make a Rails project for "Breakroom Snacks/Drink Inventory" and stick a terminal on top of the fridge, in the hopes that when someone runs us out of lunchmeat they can pop it into the shopping list and I can see it on my mobile when I'm at the store buying breakroom supplies.
[12:16:20] <Ogredude> *sigh* guess I have to buy lunch today :/
[12:17:02] <Ogredude> (mischan, sorry guys)
[12:17:50] <atriv> AG: any chance you could paste that pastebin into a diff. pastebin site? my work blocks pastebin for wahtever reason
[12:18:03] <AG> Oh, ok
[12:18:08] <atriv> http://paste.factorcode.org/new-paste
[12:18:10] <atriv> maybe there?
[12:18:21] <gratnam11> http://shampoo.baldhead.com/ipaddress/index.php some one help me pass a variable to php please
[12:18:58] <AG> atriv: http://chopapp.com/#fryhvk00
[12:19:19] <t4nkd> How would I execute an anchor containing an ID -- .click() doesn't seem to change the document position for my page
[12:20:12] <AG> atriv: http://paste.factorcode.org/paste?id=2328
[12:21:12] <Ogredude> okay here's my situation. https://gist.github.com/1083212 <-- Everything fires okay but the ul#cart never fades back in.  What am I doing wrong?
[12:22:10] <AG> atriv: one more thing, if you use the jQuery method to submit the form, I would change the submit button to a standard button: <input id="submitButtonID" type="submit"> to <input id="submitButtonID" type="button">
[12:22:32] <atriv> gotcha. thanks
[12:22:41] <Ogredude> it fades out, makes an ajax request to the appropriate place, Rails does its thing correctly, and JQuery happily clears out and replaces all the <li>'s in the #cart, but it doesn't fade the #cart back in at the end.
[12:23:20] <Ogredude> oh wait, it doesn't replace the <li>'s
[12:24:07] <gratnam11> can anyone help me with http://shampoo.baldhead.com/ipaddress/index.php
[12:24:43] <gratnam11> i am trying to pass a variable to phpe

[12:25:09] <mick`> hi, can someone help me with that very small mouseover code, what is to do, that the background-color will stay after clicking on the div?
[12:25:09] <mick`> 		<div style=" position: absolute; z-index: 22; bottom: 325px; right: 20px; color: #666666; padding-right: 15px;">
[12:25:09] <mick`> 			* Alle Preise in Euro (€). Inkl. Mehrwertsteuer, zzgl. <a href="[Page_170]">Versandkosten.</a>
[12:25:10] <mick`> 		</div>
[12:25:27] <jY> mick`, use a pastebin
[12:25:29] <mick`> sorry!!! i wantet to paste this url: http://jsfiddle.net/FJaSh/
[12:26:00] <AG> atriv: I uploaded another version to also include a call-back, so after they submit the form an acion is performed. http://paste.factorcode.org/paste?id=2328
[12:26:47] <jY> mick`, your issue is your changing it on mouseout also
[12:27:16] <atriv> AG: cool, i see. thanks a lot for your help. this looks like it'll work
[12:27:19] <atriv> just a bit more tweaking
[12:27:42] <AG> Always is! lol, you're welcome.
[12:28:05] <mick`> jY: yes but i want to keep the mouseover, for the rest
[12:28:05] <Ogredude> ok, I think it's Rails doing this, not JQuery
[12:30:06] <jY> mick`, http://jsfiddle.net/FJaSh/4/
[12:30:31] <jY> you made it way too complicated
[12:32:43] <mick`> jY, that looks good, but when i click on a other div, the frist clicked have to change bag
[12:32:45] <mick`> *back
[12:33:39] <Parserror> gratnam11: hey. I had some things to do
[12:34:18] <Parserror> gratnam11: I believe you can use some js to set the $_POST['var'] variable to what you want
[12:34:22] <jY> mick`, well that's really just a simple if statement to check the color
[12:34:34] <jY> if its black change it back to lightgrey
[12:35:34] <thebignoise> is something like this possible $(".class").css({'color' : 'red', 'font-size' : 15px}); ?
[12:36:03] <AG> jY: I think he's saying if "X" is activated, then "Y" is clicked, "Y" will become activated and "X" will become de-activated
[12:36:31] <mick`> AG yes!! but i got it thank you very much!!!
[12:36:53] <atriv> AG: so it looks like the script works well. im just not sure how pick up the data on the other end. normally if it came through a form id use foo = request.form.values(). Not sure where to get the jquery post.... does it pass as an argument?
[12:37:02] <Parserror> gratnam11: but I'd have to know how you're rendering your PHP to help out. are you using print or echo to dump the html? That's how I used to do it like 5 years ago haha
[12:37:04] <kborchers> thebignoise: yes see ?css
[12:37:04] <bot-t> thebignoise, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:37:11] <Parserror> gratnam11: haven't been in the PHP game since then
[12:38:22] <jY> mick`, http://jsfiddle.net/FJaSh/7/
[12:38:39] <ch3mical> Hey, when you send xml data with .ajax, does that have to be an xmldoc or a string of xml?
[12:38:43] <jY> opps.. why is that breaking the hover now
[12:38:44] <jY> hmm
[12:38:48] <mick`> hehe
[12:38:57] <mick`> got an simular problem :\
[12:39:10] <jY> ohh right cause the element style overrides it
[12:39:15] <gym_jane_> guys do you know of any accordian plugin - light weight one?
[12:39:18] <jY> ok just gonna switch classes then
[12:39:46] <AG> atriv: That's where my expertise becomes limited as I know nothing about Python. If we were using PHP it would simply be called by the variable "$_POST['InputVal1']". Does that first link I gave you get you close at all? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/464040/how-are-post-and-get-variables-handled-in-python
[12:42:07] <AG> atriv: A jQuery POST technically will be handled the same way as a normal html POST, so the fact that we're using jQuery to execute it should not change how the data is received on the other end.
[12:42:12] <Moses_> Do selectables only work if the selector you used to activate them contained an id? I can't seem to get a selector working using a class selector
[12:42:18] <jY> mick`, http://jsfiddle.net/FJaSh/9/
[12:42:33] <atriv> AG: yeah, this points me in the right direction. ill keep plugging away at it
[12:42:41] <Parserror> gym_jane_: I thought the jQuery UI had a built-in one?
[12:42:56] <gym_jane_> Parseerror it does but it is too much for what i need
[12:43:03] <mick`> hey jY, thank you so much!!!
[12:43:07] <jY> np
[12:43:10] <kborchers> gym_jane: just build a custom of download of jquery ui that only includes accordion. i believe it will add in any other dependency modules for you but if not just include core, widget and any effects you want
[12:43:50] <atriv> AG: got it!
[12:43:52] <atriv> thanks again
[12:44:11] <AG> Awesome!! No worries, always happy to help. :)
[12:45:43] <Parserror> gym_jane_: I'm not sure then, sorry
[12:46:29] <t4nkd> Can anybody who can see what I'm trying to do here point me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/6cems/
[12:46:55] <Moses_> Where should I report bugs in jQuery UI?
[12:47:31] <kborchers> Moses_: bugs.jqueryui.com ... but what is the bug. it may already be known or not a bug ;)
[12:47:34] <t4nkd> I'm confident .click() isn't what I need here but I'm not sure what is
[12:48:05] <Moses_> Can't activate a selectable without using an id for a selector. Take a look here for an example: http://jsfiddle.net/wf5QJ/33/
[12:48:32] <Moses_> The commented line works, I haven't been able to get anythign that's not an id to work with it
[12:48:39] <AG> t4nkd: are you just trying to jump to a different part of the page by clcicking a link?
[12:48:43] <ch3mical> is $.parseXML broken in 1.6?
[12:48:49] <t4nkd> Yeah, but, via jquery
[12:48:52] <t4nkd> like, on pageload
[12:49:13] <Parserror> If I have a form I'm submitting via this method http://pastie.org/2213742, how can I get it to update a div properly without reloading?
[12:49:19] <AG> t4nkd: may I ask why you need to use jQuery? This can be easily accomplished by simple html.
[12:49:51] <t4nkd> Explain?
[12:50:09] <Moses_> kborchers: Let me know if you agree that its a bug, and I"ll post it
[12:50:10] <Parserror> So, I click the link, the form submits, then I want to catch the data that results and populate the div with it
[12:50:28] <AG> t4nkd: Well, I see now since you want it on the page load. I submitted right before I read that part.
[12:50:28] <logansrun> how would you go about creating a draggable droppable event
[12:50:35] <t4nkd> oh, no problem man
[12:50:35] <AG> Hold on, let me tinker a sec.
[12:50:37] <logansrun> where if i drag a thumbnail into an image
[12:50:38] <t4nkd> yeah I'm lost
[12:50:38] <t4nkd> tyty
[12:50:43] <logansrun> the image changes to the fullszie version
[12:51:05] <logansrun> <img src="thumbnail" & fullurl="">
[12:51:09] <logansrun> can i make up img tags like that?
[12:51:15] <logansrun> img.fullurl
[12:51:16] <Po0dle2> No
[12:51:47] <logansrun> so i need a central array and reference it in botht the thumbnail and the full image/
[12:51:56] <logansrun> containing images and thumbnail urls?
[12:52:03] <BillCriswell> I have a  $('#slider').slider({ create: function( event, ui ) { alert('Test'); }); that's not alerting 'Test' even thought the slider is being created. Any ideas?
[12:52:11] <josh__> hey all.  Question on jQuery templates.  Any tips on debugging?  Anyway to see where they fail, or get other information about why it doesn't return what you'd expect?
[12:52:32] <schnib> erm Hai :)
[12:53:09] <t4nkd> AG: hey thanks man, I got it though, window.location = $(this).attr('href');
[12:54:03] <MoTiOnXml> t4nkd: do you need $(this) for the .href?
[12:54:09] <logansrun> po0dle2 amirite?
[12:54:13] <schnib> i just have one silly question concerning the deep copying, am I right that a deepcopying with extend will not "deep copy" attributes of a method of an object ?
[12:54:14] <t4nkd> It was just a meta example
[12:54:16] <kborchers> Moses_: unfortunately i think i have to agree and i don't see a similar bug so i would go ahead and file it.
[12:54:27] <jedimind_> anyone here got experience with colorbox?
[12:54:33] <Po0dle2> I don't know logansrun :)
[12:54:37] <Moses_> okie dokey, and thank you kborchers
[12:54:40] <logansrun> thanks dude
[12:54:43] <logansrun> ill take a shot!
[12:54:49] <t4nkd> But yeah there's like 10 unique hrefs on the page so I need a selector :P
[12:54:57] <Po0dle2> I just saw an '&' in an html tag
[12:55:45] <schnib> and by attributes i mean properties :)
[12:58:08] <Parserror> Anyone know why this isn't working? http://pastie.org/2213742
[12:58:26] <josh__> Hmmm.  Well, any tools/tips on debugging jQuery templates?
[12:58:33] <t4nkd> ty for the help jquery
[13:00:33] <kborchers> Moses_: you still there?
[13:01:30] <Moses_> yes
[13:01:35] <Moses_> :kborchers yes
[13:01:40] <kborchers> not a bug
[13:01:51] <Moses_> What was I doing wrong?
[13:02:59] <kborchers> Moses_: jquery ui does not support 1.6.x yet http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/wf5QJ/41/
[13:03:30] <AG> t4nkd>: No problem, sorry I got distracted anyhow. Glad you got it worked out! So simple too... that's one of those problems where I'm constantly thinking "It HAS to be easier than this..."
[13:03:38] <Moses_> Oh, damn
[13:03:45] <Moses_> Thank you very much kborchers
[13:04:02] <kborchers> no problem
[13:04:44] <elux_> hey guys
[13:04:59] <NemesisD> anyone know how i'd defer a form submit?
[13:04:59] <elux_> i was wondering if someone could recommend a good pattern for OO-style dev with javascript?
[13:05:02] <NemesisD> or delay
[13:05:20] <elux_> i know there are many ways.. prototypical inheritance, etc. etc.  what is considered to be the best practice?
[13:05:23] <Parserror> nvm, solved my problem
[13:05:35] <NemesisD> i need to catch a form submit, do some ajax stuff, continue with the submit when the ajax stuff completes
[13:06:00] <Assimilater> what can i do to make this actually show the htmlentity? $(this).val($(this).attr('base') + ' ' + (($(this).attr('dir') == 'DESC') ? '&#8595;' : '&#8593;'));
[13:06:10] <Whirl3d> So, is there any way to call one function on several divs where each one has it's own implementation of the function:  example.  item1.init()    item2.init()   where item1.init() sets item1' color red and item2.init() sets item2 to 200% height
[13:06:58] <phlp> Moses_, kborchers, seems to be the jquerylint that was causing errors? http://jsfiddle.net/wf5QJ/43
[13:08:19] <kborchers> phlp: yeah, maybe that was the issue but also shouldn't use jq 1.6.2 since not supported by UI yet
[13:10:11] <Assimilater> anyone? ^^
[13:10:43] <Crystal_> ello :)
[13:11:59] <Seldon75> I have a page that makes several calls to the same endpoint using $.ajax().  In some cases the success() handler 'data' parameter returns a raw Text(HTML) response, and in other cases it's returning a JS object called 'Document'
[13:12:03] <Seldon75> what determines this?
[13:12:39] <MoTiOnXml> Seldon75: your service fails and sends a 500 error?
[13:12:45] <MoTiOnXml> Seldon75: or 404?
[13:12:52] <Seldon75> MoTiOnXml: no it's not an error response
[13:12:53] <Crystal_> new to jquery....trying to write a basic script for nav and it's not responding. anyone up for giving assistance?
[13:12:55] <MoTiOnXml> Seldon75: ?g fiddler
[13:13:01] <MoTiOnXml> ?g fiddler
[13:13:03] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, Fiddler Web Debugger - A free web debugging tool - http://www.fiddler2.com/
[13:13:15] <Seldon75> MoTiOnXml: difficult, since it'll depend on what my app os sending back
[13:13:21] <Seldon75> *is
[13:13:26] <MoTiOnXml> check with fiddler
[13:13:31] <MoTiOnXml> sometimes you get surprised
[13:13:39] <schnib> or is it just "working as intentended" that method properties are not deep copied ? :)
[13:13:51] <Seldon75> MoTiOnXml: but I cant expose the Ajax endpoint (that's on my local server)
[13:14:09] <MoTiOnXml> ?
[13:14:19] <MoTiOnXml> fiddler runs locally
[13:14:31] <MoTiOnXml> intercepting your http traffic
[13:14:36] <phlp> probably confusing it with jsfiddle
[13:14:42] <Seldon75> oh, yes
[13:14:59] <Seldon75> i'll use Chrome's Network tab then
[13:15:14] <MoTiOnXml> or fiddler, like i said ;)
[13:16:23] <Seldon75> yeah the data coming back is HTML, but it arrives int he success() handler's data parameter as a 'Document'
[13:16:37] <Assimilater> anyone know what can i do to make this actually show the htmlentity?
[13:16:37] <Assimilater> $(this).val($(this).attr('base') + ' ' + (($(this).attr('dir') == 'DESC') ? '&#8595;' : '&#8593;'));
[13:16:37] <datarecall> any thoughts on why this doesnt actually delay : $('#checkavail').slideUp(100).delay(5000).hide();
[13:16:43] <Seldon75> i can only guess that jQuery has detected that it's a document and wrapped it somehow
[13:16:59] <MoTiOnXml> it's playing tricks on you
[13:17:21] <Crystal_> anyone have a sec to give some pointers on some issues i'm having with jquery. it's with nav setup
[13:17:45] <Assimilater> !+ask
[13:17:53] <Assimilater> !ask
[13:17:57] <Assimilater> darn bot
[13:18:02] <Assimilater> what is it...
[13:18:04] <Assimilater> `ask
[13:18:07] <Assimilater> meh
[13:18:31] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:18:56] <Crystal_> i'm new to jquery and trying to build a nav for a site. but it looks like my javascript isn't even responding on my page and i'm not sure what i'm missing
[13:19:01] <orolo> i need to escape a # sign in a string. any ideas?
[13:19:13] <orolo> \# isn't working (as part of the string)
[13:19:26] <Assimilater> Crystal_: did you try checking for syntax errors with firebug, an error console or chrome web developer tools?
[13:19:29] <Seldon75> it's definitely wrapping the response in a Document object if it's a self-contained XML document
[13:19:43] <Crystal_> yes i'm using firebug. no errors are being thrown
[13:19:53] <Assimilater> Crystal_: are you including the js on the page?
[13:19:58] <Seldon75> unless there's more than a single (x)html node in the response
[13:20:00] <Assimilater> Crystal_: if yes, can you include a link to the page?
[13:20:02] <nbari|away> on jquery-ui how to remove the autofocus on the first button currently I am trying with this http://jsfiddle.net/tnm5W/
[13:20:39] <loneboat> I'm using jquery-ui to style my BUTTON elements.  Is there some easy way to change the text on the button?  if I use $('#someButtonId').html('new button text'); it wipes out the SPAN which jquery-ui injects.  :-\
[13:20:43] <Crystal_> assimilater, the page isn't live yet, but I can list my code on jsfiddle....?
[13:20:53] <Assimilater> Crystal_: either or
[13:22:10] <kborchers> loneboat: try .text
[13:22:21] <phlp> Assimilater: this one works $('input').val($('<p>&#8595;</p>').html());
[13:22:39] <kborchers> loneboat: or on a submit button you could try .val()
[13:22:49] <Assimilater> umm, it doesn't make sense to have p elements in the button's value does it?
[13:23:03] <Assimilater> $(this) is <input type="button" ... >
[13:23:10] <phlp> no but the html() gets whats inside the p
[13:23:17] <nbari> back
[13:23:18] <Assimilater> ooooh
[13:23:21] <nbari> back
[13:23:21] <Seldon75> so you guys don't know anything abour response document wrapping?
[13:25:06] <loneboat> Thanks, kborchers.  .text still does the same.  I guess I'm just going to have to convert them all to INPUT elements.  :-(
[13:26:47] <kborchers> loneboat: do $("#someButtonID .ui-button-text").html('new button text');
[13:26:55] <Assimilater> phlp: ya that works, thanks
[13:27:04] <phlp> yep :)
[13:27:10] <Seldon75> so, incase anyone is wondering, it seems if you use jqXHR.responseText in the success handler that's a way to always get raw text(html) indead of sometimes a wrapped Document object
[13:28:00] <Whirl3d> Seldon75, isn't it only wrapped once you append the text to the dom?
[13:28:33] <Seldon75> Whirl3d: sorry i don't follow
[13:28:39] <Seldon75> what text to what dom
[13:29:06] <Whirl3d> in loading content via ajax, the data you get back is the raw text, isn't it?
[13:29:48] <Whirl3d> sry. Just saw that you were referring to xml. My bad. nvm
[13:29:49] <xopherg> yeah
[13:31:14] <loneboat> kborchers:  Thanks.  That works.  I was trying to separate my code from jquery-ui's guts, though...
[13:31:58] <kborchers> loneboat: not really possible there since that span is added to the dom so it is part of your code now ;)
[13:32:02] <schnib> anyone on the deepcopying? Or is it working as intended?  *annoy* :)
[13:32:41] <kborchers> schnib: what was your ?
[13:33:02] <schnib> if you use the extend for deepcopying on an object with a method which has a property
[13:33:13] <schnib> it will get passed by reference, no?
[13:34:41] <schnib> does it make sense what i said ? :P
[13:35:12] <kborchers> schnib: i think i understand your question but not sure if i know the answer. have you tried it? ;)
[13:36:25] <schnib> yes, and if i change the property on object a, object b (which is the deepcopied a) gets its property changed aswell
[13:36:37] <schnib> the question is, if that is intended ?
[13:37:08] <supsup> question:  when i do an ajax request with data: filled in as an object with a key: value -- in 1.3.2 it appends data to url correctly, but in 1.6 it adds %5B%5D inbetween the key and = sign of the value -- anyone experiance this?
[13:38:05] <kborchers> schnib: hmmm, not sure if that is intended but seems like it shouldn't happen. unless i don't totally understand extend ;)
[13:39:50] <simulation> hello guys, i have an issue with jquery + firefox5 or chrome. My code issues if my page is in inactive tab of FF5 or Chrome :S
[13:40:03] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGuz/   --- grrrr wtf is wrong with this sortable/draggable table??
[13:40:12] <simulation> http://demo.cihanuygun.com/polo/ the site is here who wanna check it ?
[13:40:16] <swiggy> i want to be able to drag/sort the elements inside of a tables <tbody>
[13:41:36] <supsup> here is example of the ajax issue:  http://jsfiddle.net/SuCkH/1/
[13:42:20] <kborchers> swiggy: remove the ; after true in sortable call and comment out tablesorter since you don't have that resource in the fiddle and it works
[13:42:21] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/PaGuz/   --- grrrr wtf is wrong with this sortable/draggable table?? i need to be able to sort/drag the <tr> elements within the <tbody>
[13:42:47] <loneboat> kborchers:  Thanks.  Guess I was just hoping there was a tidy method which abstracted the DOM manipulation away.  Thanks though!
[13:42:58] <kborchers> swiggy: the error was obvious if you look at your error console
[13:43:07] <kborchers> loneboat: np
[13:43:07] <swiggy> amazing
[13:43:09] <swiggy> ty
[13:43:09] <swiggy> wtf
[13:43:11] <simulation> anyone wanna help ? :/
[13:43:13] <swiggy> why is the ; breaking it
[13:43:14] <swiggy> ??
[13:43:33] <schnib> hum hum, oki thanks so far kborchers :)
[13:43:36] <swiggy> revert:true;  ---> revert:true
[13:43:40] <swiggy> fixes it? wtf
[13:43:57] <kborchers> swiggy: because that is not how a javascript object is written
[13:47:28] <kappaluppa> I'm trying to do a show/hide, but I want it to be different in that I want it to check the text until  it gets to a certain number of characters. It would then wrap a DIV from  that position to the end of the text which could then be hidden with  the hide() method. Then have a show/hide feature. I have it worked out (thanks to stackoverflow) until it shows text, but can't figure out how to hide the text again.

[14:12:33] <PhanLord> how would i add an jquery-ui icon to lets say a <td>
[14:13:53] <kborchers> PhanLord: look at the jQuery UI css. there are classes for every icon
[14:14:39] <ajpiano> PhanLord: class="ui-icon ui-icon-plusthick" for instance
[14:14:47] <PhanLord> soa dding that class to a element should accomplish it
[14:15:01] <PhanLord> oh so ui-icons ahs to be added aswell
[14:15:02] <PhanLord> o
[14:15:05] <ajpiano> yeah, donno if a td is the best idea
[14:15:09] <ajpiano> yup
[14:15:20] <black_warlock> how can I auto submit form after i ve selected the file i want to upload ?
[14:16:09] <ajpiano> black_warlock: wait for a change event on the file input and then trigger the submit on the form
[14:16:21] <WebDragon> given the following: http://fpaste.org/26dn/ I'm trying to figure out a good way to put a dotted-underline between the paragraph text, and the span.price but not under the strong or span.price
[14:16:34] <black_warlock> im trying but doesnt work
[14:16:44] <WebDragon> I could swear I'd done this sort of thing in the past somewhere, but can't for the life of me find it anywhere
[14:17:01] <WebDragon> I can't even remember what that sort of typographical thing is called :/
[14:17:07] <black_warlock> <script>
[14:17:07] <black_warlock> $("#attach1").change(function() {
[14:17:07] <black_warlock> $(this).closest("frmSend").submit();
[14:17:07] <black_warlock> });
[14:17:07] <black_warlock> </script>
[14:17:22] <ajpiano> black_warlock: a) use a pastebin next time
[14:17:26] <ajpiano> b) frmSend is not an element
[14:17:27] <kborchers> black_warlock: please don't paste here see ?p
[14:17:27] <bot-t> black_warlock, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:17:30] <black_warlock> its little script mate
[14:17:31] <ajpiano> perhaps you mean .frmSend
[14:17:40] <WebDragon> still, use pastebins
[14:17:44] <ajpiano> black_warlock: anything over one line it is considered unacceptable to paste into IRC channels
[14:17:46] <WebDragon> just courtesy

[14:20:20] <black_warlock> this is the from
[14:20:38] <ajpiano> black_warlock: do $(this).closest("form")
[14:20:45] <ravenzz> WebDragon span.price { display:block; border-top:1px solid black }
[14:20:45] <ravenzz> ?
[14:21:04] <supsup> ajax issue: between 1.3.2 and 1.6  http://jsfiddle.net/SuCkH/1/  has anyone seen this?  why does it add ascii [] before each = ?
[14:21:17] <black_warlock> let me try
[14:21:18] <kborchers> ajpiano: you need to stop saying everything right before me ;)
[14:21:31] <WebDragon> ravenzz: more like #menucontents p > *:not(span):not(strong) { border-bottom: 1px dotted gray; } but that doesn't work
[14:22:19] <WebDragon> basically a p that contains no child elements (only text) should have no border-bottom, or conversely, a p that contains strong/span should have a border-bottom but NOT beneath the strong/span elements, just the main content
[14:22:28] <WebDragon> not sure css can do this
[14:22:29] <ravenzz> you said that need a line between the text and the span.price
[14:22:56] <WebDragon> when span.price gets floated right, I need dots between the end of the text and the start of the span
[14:23:06] <WebDragon> is that more succinct?
[14:23:10] <ravenzz> oh
[14:23:13] <WebDragon> I know there's a typographical term to describe this
[14:23:14] <ravenzz> so a border-left
[14:23:54] <WebDragon> mmm sorta. it's a border bottom on the space between the end of the paragraph's immediate content and the child span element
[14:24:02] <gratnam11> the ajax function isn't working for me please helpo
[14:24:05] <gratnam11> http://shampoo.baldhead.com/ipaddress/index.php
[14:24:06] <black_warlock> doesnt work =(
[14:24:56] <ajpiano> black_warlock: try $(this).closest("form")[0].submit()
[14:26:23] <black_warlock> nothing
[14:26:24] <ravenzz> WebDragon is one of these fiddle the one you are looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/TJhhs/2/ http://jsfiddle.net/TJhhs/3/
[14:27:47] <gratnam11> anyone?
[14:27:58] <WebDragon> p>:nochildren, p>strong, p>span { border: 0} p { border-bottom: 1px dotted gray}
[14:28:02] <kborchers> black_warlock: you need to wrap that script in $(function() {...});
[14:28:16] <WebDragon> more like that, but I don't know how to tell css to put no border on a p that has no child elements
[14:28:29] <WebDragon> just content
[14:28:41] <kborchers> black_warlock: that element isn't there when you call bind cuz the dom isn't ready yet
[14:29:21] <kborchers> black_warlock: sorry, by bind i meant change ... same thing ... sorta :)
[14:29:33] <black_warlock> so cant do it ?
[14:29:35] <black_warlock> =\
[14:29:56] <kborchers> black_warlock: do what i said earlier and it will work ^^^
[14:30:06] <black_warlock> repeat pls
[14:30:09] <thebignoise> I feel like I should know the answer to this but how to you make you jquery.js a jquery.min.js
[14:30:10] <black_warlock> i lost it
[14:30:18] <kborchers> [16:28] <kborchers> black_warlock: you need to wrap that script in $(function() {...});
[14:32:54] <black_warlock> hell now work
[14:32:58] <black_warlock> why that ?
[14:33:01] <WebDragon> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/TJhhs/10/  this is almost right, but it still puts the border on the span and on the <p><em>
[14:33:22] <black_warlock> but must not use document.ready function ?
[14:34:07] <black_warlock> bravo BRAVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !
[14:34:10] <black_warlock> =) tks
[14:34:18] <kborchers> black_warlock: you can use either $(function() or $(document).ready(function()  they would both accomplish making your script wait for the dom to be ready.
[14:34:21] <kborchers> glad to help
[14:34:34] <kborchers> gotta go. happy coding :)
[14:34:46] <black_warlock> did i say bravo ?_?

[15:02:57] <EDK> but i have a veru little bug that i am facing now...
[15:03:02] <jY> removed the "'s?
[15:03:16] <phlp> gratnam11: remove the onclick="submit()" on the image and put e.preventDefault(); in your click callback ( use function(e) )
[15:03:17] <EDK> yes...
[15:03:19] <pifantastic> gratnam11: this is a jquery channel, jsfiddle is for javascript, maybe try http://gist.github.com or codepad.org?
[15:03:19] <EDK> i did
[15:03:24] <EDK> you can see now.. it works
[15:03:30] <EDK> http://samirayousefi.com/slider/
[15:04:04] <EDK> but only having a little problem... div doesnt fit on the exact div...
[15:04:26] <EDK> it has to be fix on as same as the div size has...
[15:04:31] <EDK> can you see it?
[15:05:36] <gratnam11> heeres my code
[15:05:41] <gratnam11> https://gist.github.com/01de3cf9a1d24019473d
[15:06:28] <EDK> <jY> r u here?
[15:07:26] <jY> EDK, i'm not a css person
[15:08:36] * delinquentme just googled "jquery test variable for numericalness"
[15:08:48] <delinquentme> its totally a word
[15:08:49] <delinquentme> lol
[15:10:46] <gratnam11> i use function(e) i get random numbers
[15:10:56] <gratnam11> not what i set in   data: {id:'45'}
[15:13:06] <phlp> well you forgot the e.preventDefault(); in the function but im still not sure what youre trying to do. the form is submitting before you get a response from your ajax
[15:13:56] <gratnam11> oh yeah
[15:14:21] <gratnam11> i am learning jquery
[15:14:22] <gratnam11> i
[15:14:41] <gratnam11> i want to learn how to pass a query variable to php first then tackle that issue
[15:15:18] <delinquentme> how can i invoke IsNumeric() in jquery?
[15:15:18] <gratnam11> where would e.preventDefault(); exactly go
[15:15:45] <phlp> right after your ajax.. that blank space you have there
[15:15:59] <gratnam11> oh okay one sec
[15:16:42] <gratnam11> this is so hard
[15:16:46] <gratnam11> its not printing
[15:16:54] <gratnam11> i mean echoing
[15:17:28] <ezrafree> hello
[15:18:29] <gratnam11> phlp you there?
[15:18:43] <phlp> if you look at the reponse in firebug you can see the 45 at the bottom.. all the html probably shouldnt be returned by your php
[15:19:25] <gratnam11> okay one sec
[15:20:30] <gratnam11> i am on firebug,
[15:20:40] <gratnam11> i don't know where to look for the 45
[15:20:48] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me how to refresh the contents of a colorbox?
[15:21:15] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to style the autocomplete ui?
[15:21:22] <Es0teric> from jquery autocomplete ui
[15:21:39] <phlp> gratnam11: look at the Net tab.. you can see the POST as it happens. click it then click Response, scroll to the bottom
[15:22:49] <Articate> Could someone help me understand the best way to manage my code?
[15:23:01] <gratnam11> oh yeah i see it
[15:23:03] <Articate> I'm making a web-site where there are some navigation tabs that will be hidden for most users
[15:23:06] <gratnam11> i also see test45cannot select DB
[15:23:16] <gratnam11> but on the page it only says testcannot select DB
[15:23:20] <gratnam11> any idea why
[15:23:41] <Articate> which means I'll have the tabs that are normal there, and at the end of the list call a function that draws up the other tabs that user sees. That code will be the same in all files
[15:23:51] <Articate> should I then have a seperate file with that code in?
[15:24:00] <Articate> and should that code be in a class?
[15:24:08] <phlp> gratnam11: because you used ajax. it wont do that for you. use the success callback for ajax and do whatever you want with the response
[15:25:21] <Articate> and seen how this is a system that is evolving, thus adding more tabs, is it defendable to put all of those tabs into one function that generates all tabs, to make more maintainable code so I won't have to add the new tabs to ever page when a new one arrives?
[15:25:59] <gratnam11> phlp, do you think you can show me the correct syntax?
[15:26:57] <gratnam11> would it be success:function(result){
[15:26:58] <gratnam11>     $("POST").html(result);
[15:27:18] <phlp> http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#example-7.1
[15:27:29] <Articate> umh.. I'm in the wrong channel :D
[15:28:43] <delinquentme> so IsNumeric is a JS operation
[15:28:48] <delinquentme> ... how do i run it in jquery
[15:28:48] <phlp> gratnam11: that will probably work but it wont be what you expect. your php is returning the entire page for the post so all your html will end up beside that button. use another file to post to that returns json
[15:28:59] <Cork[home]> delinquentme: just run it
[15:29:09] <bot-t> delinquentme, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[15:29:10] <Cork[home]> jquery is just a library written in javascript
[15:30:54] <delinquentme> if (IsNumeric(data)) {  << not evaluating as it should be
[15:31:18] <Cork[home]> delinquentme: whats data?
[15:31:27] <delinquentme> a number
[15:31:59] <delinquentme> i feel like that wasn't the type of answer you were after...?
[15:32:01] <Cork[home]> uh wait a min...
[15:32:09] <Cork[home]> isnumeric?`
[15:32:24] <delinquentme> ya>
[15:32:25] <delinquentme> >
[15:32:29] <delinquentme> hell !! ??
[15:32:42] <Cork[home]> ?eval var data = 10; NaN(data);
[15:32:43] <bot-t> Cork[home]: TypeError: NaN is not a function
[15:32:47] <Cork[home]> ?eval var data = 10; IsNaN(data);

[15:32:56] <Cork[home]> ugg
[15:33:03] <Cork[home]> close :P
[15:33:06] <phlp> :)

[15:41:54] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to style jquery ui autocomplete?
[15:54:58] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm not sure how to get a click event for a button to work. I've tried live and click. http://pastie.org/2214993
[15:56:53] <phlp> SpaceghostC2C: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-3
[15:57:22] <Parserror> If I have this code, http://pastie.org/2215005 how can I insert the id value of the .click element into the prop() function?
[15:57:45] <SpaceghostC2C> phlp: I don't need that part, the dom is ready before that little snippet is executed, but I'll try it a bit.
[15:58:19] <phlp> Parserror: $(this).attr('id')
[15:58:38] <Parserror> phlp: thanks, I'll give it a shot :)
[15:59:16] <phlp> SpaceghostC2C: are you using <button> or is it a <input type="button">
[15:59:29] <SpaceghostC2C> phlp: Hm, that's a good point. Let me double check.
[16:00:05] <SpaceghostC2C> phlp: I am using input. What's the difference between the two?
[16:00:37] <Parserror> phlp: no luck :(
[16:00:45] <phlp> well one difference is 'button' wont select it
[16:00:53] <SpaceghostC2C> haha.
[16:01:47] <phlp> http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element
[16:02:04] <Parserror> phlp: I want to insert the id of the $("a[id^='sbmt_']") into the prop()
[16:02:50] <solidus-river> how do i tell what functions get run on load for a widget
[16:03:09] <phlp> Parserror: $("#smbt_methd").val($(this).attr('id'));
[16:03:38] <Parserror> phlp: don't use prop() altogether?
[16:04:00] <Es0teric> how do i style the jquery ui autocomplete? and how do i make it submit when i click on one of the results?
[16:04:14] <phlp> value has its own function, why not use it?
[16:04:26] <Parserror> phlp: ok. didn't know :P
[16:04:35] <phlp> :)
[16:06:01] <Parserror> phlp: great success :) thanks
[16:06:12] <phlp> np
[16:10:27] <danieliser> im in need of some advice.. i need to save a lot of information an efficient manner. basically i meed to save an infinite number of sortable tabs, each tab has a infinite number sortable list and each list item will have several options.. any ideas
[16:10:47] <solidus-river> does jquery run everything with a _ in front of it at at initialization of a widget?
[16:11:16] <thun> Hey guys I am making a get request and loading the data into a textarea... all is well but the textarea includes BR's. I can remove the br from the source but how to I get the data to have line breaks inside the textarea without brs?
[16:12:39] <phlp> thun: "a<br>b<br>c".replace(/<br>/g,'\n');
[16:13:45] <thun> phlp: ty
[16:14:44] <hypno> i have a form in a dialog. what i want to do is to send with post, but then the dialog itself should just be closed. instead i get redirected to the action page in form. how to fix this?
[16:15:05] <danieliser> return false maybe?
[16:15:37] <hypno> danieliser: was that for me?
[16:15:57] <danieliser> hypno: yea.. sorry.. still not used to using irc
[16:16:20] <hypno> danieliser: what exactly do you mean by returning false?
[16:16:29] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i get the second entry "bar1423425452"? http://pastebin.com/rqkCkbDG
[16:16:39] <yan_nick> Foo.settings.GETSECONDITEM :s
[16:16:39] <danieliser> hypno: try adding return false; to the end of your save function which im assuming is attatched to your submit button
[16:17:57] <danieliser> hypno: when adding onclick function to a link or submit button adding return false; keeps it from executing its default function.. ie linking to another page or submiting the form to the action page
[16:20:09] <yan_nick> guys?
[16:20:30] <danieliser> any ideas on how to save sortable tabs, each with sortable li, each with optoins
[16:21:45] <phlp> yan_nick: Foo.settings.bar1243343252352
[16:22:07] <yan_nick> phlp: and if bar 41312312 is generated and i really just want to get the _second_ item?
[16:22:32] <danieliser> is there a way to serialize it and be able to rebuild the structure?
[16:25:08] <bkad|home> i'm having some trouble with creating a draggable div http://jsfiddle.net/bkad/gVrGH/
[16:25:12] <phlp> ?js var foo = {}, x = '', n = { "foo": "baz", "bar12352": 'this one' }; for (var i in n) { if (/^bar[0-9]*/.test(i)) x = i; } $.extend(foo, n); foo[x]
[16:25:13] <bot-t> phlp: "this one"
[16:25:21] <phlp> yan_nick: ;)
[16:25:59] <yan_nick> phlp: rly? :s wtff
[16:26:38] <phlp> properties aren't meant to be ordered
[16:26:50] <yan_nick> phlp: in my case it isn't bar1314234 but an unknown element id
[16:27:11] <yan_nick> phlp: or how can i get the thing which starts with bar?
[16:27:30] <phlp> that's what the example did. any number works
[16:28:03] <yan_nick> phlp: :C i thought it's easier
[16:28:38] <danieliser> any ideas on my end phlp?
[16:32:01] <hypno> danieliser: hmm. i'm using document.forms("form").submit(); to invoke the submit. that must be wrong, right? if i comment that out, and just return false nothing happends, as you said.
[16:33:01] <z1000> so I have a few links in #snav - I want them to index and then run a switch/case/unique function depending on which specific item # was clicked, is this possible? Here is what I tried so far: http://pastie.org/2215154
[16:33:58] <danieliser> hypno: you could just use $('#submitbutton').click(function(){ //Do Stuff Here; return false; });
[16:34:01] <yan_nick> And how how can I toggle a keyup? Means, if I press Space bar sth should happen and if I click it again something other should happen - how can i  do that?
[16:34:09] <z1000> problem is the IF function runs no matter which one I click... so I must be doing it wrong... any ideas?
[16:35:27] <hypno> z1000: = is used for assignment!
[16:35:53] <Masih> hello guys
[16:35:56] <hypno> z1000: use ===
[16:36:11] <z1000> hmm now wont work at all
[16:36:16] <z1000> I wonder if I should use nth selector
[16:36:23] <Masih> I have a problem with Jquery's Ajax in IE 8.  is anyone here who can help me?
[16:36:46] <z1000> I have like 5 links in a list... without using ID or class... I want to say... when you click the first one do this... when you click the second do something else.. etc... what is the most effective way to do this
[16:38:12] <Masih> z1000: if you have a parent element, use this : $('parent a:nth-child(1)').click(...)
[16:38:29] <danieliser> I need a method to save sortable tabs - each has a sortable list - each list item has a set of options.. any ideas of how this could be saved to be rebuilt later?
[16:38:42] <z1000> not sure what you mean exactly by IF I have a parent element
[16:38:53] <Masih> z1000: do it by a FOR loop. and replace 1 with the counter of loop
[16:39:25] <Masih> I mean if they are nested in an element (a tag) that you can select that
[16:39:31] <z1000> hmm but each siblings click will need to do a different function
[16:39:41] <z1000> if you want I can show you exactly what I am working on which may help
[16:39:47] <z1000> 1 sec let me upload
[16:40:00] <Masih> ok
[16:40:10] <Masih> meanwhile, is there anyone who can help me? :D
[16:40:32] <danieliser> not many people on it appears
[16:41:11] <z1000> http://p7dev.com/yatco/ so notice towards top right... FOR SALE CHARTER etc... when you click one of these... the search fields below will be fade the correct div on top
[16:41:41] <dilvie> What are you guys using for client-side templating? What do you like / dislike about it?
[16:41:58] <jedimind> microtemplating
[16:42:10] <jedimind> dilvie, http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[16:42:11] <dilvie> I'm playing with jquery.tmpl, but I'm also interested in checking out other solutions, like PURE, handlebars, mustache, etc..
[16:42:47] <dilvie> jedimind: yeah, I've looked at that. Have you run into any gotchas with it?
[16:42:55] <erichynds> i like mustache because the syntax is easy, sets context within the template, and supports partials
[16:43:27] <dilvie> I don't like the syntax of micro-templating, and I don't think resig is using it, himself.
[16:43:44] <dilvie> eric: good points.
[16:43:53] <erichynds> it's built into underscore.js fwiw
[16:44:03] <KingDosser> If I am sending an ajax call and want to directly afterwards target an element being returned from that call, how can I do this?
[16:44:08] <dilvie> eric: does it support dot notation? like, can I do {{ customer.name }}?
[16:45:26] <dilvie> kingdosser: what do you mean by "target an element"?
[16:46:04] <dilvie> kingdosser: you mean give the element focus?
[16:46:08] <KingDosser> I want to add css properties to it dilvie. By default it is display: none but on certain conditions, I want to make it visible. @dilvie.
[16:47:22] <jedimind> to be honest, i've always followed resig's concept for microtemplating
[16:47:29] <jedimind> and then rolled out my own templating structures per project
[16:48:41] <dilvie> kingDosser: king: that depends on what you're getting back from the ajax call. If you have an actual element object, you can just wrap it with jquery and act on it just like you'd do with a regular dom element. ie, $(response.myElem).css(...);
[16:48:56] <KingDosser>  Its being returned in a string dilvie.
[16:49:20] <imsky> hey folks
[16:49:34] <dilvie> KingDosser: try the same thing.
[16:50:45] <ray24> How come.. if i don't troll for a day.. i feel anxious?
[16:50:55] <ray24> Hi guys.. My name's Ray. I'm here to learn from you
[16:51:01] <GeoDud> oh gah
[16:51:20] <GeoDud> how is webby formed?
[16:51:47] <necromancer> how vps get pragnent
[16:51:56] <ray24> necromancer, d2 was a sick game
[16:52:00] <ray24> I played that game so much back in the days
[16:52:14] <ray24> But I prolly could pwn if you still played. Just saying
[16:52:16] <necromancer> jedimind: did you actually get templates to work properly?
[16:52:31] <necromancer> they're so cumbersome...
[16:58:22] <ray24> This is one most inactive chats I've been to in a while
[16:58:30] <ray24> How come there are zero activity in here
[16:58:47] <bkad|home> is there any way to persist the dom element created by the helper defined in a 'draggable'?
[16:58:47] <phlp> $.activate()
[17:12:13] <danieliser> I need a method to save sortable tabs - each has a sortable list - each list item has a set of options.. any ideas of how this could be saved to be rebuilt later?
[17:15:04] <codyrobbins> Is there any way to make jQuery() not return a collection with a single item in it?
[17:15:11] <codyrobbins> I need to get a jQuery object for a non-DOM object in order to use a jQuery plugin on it.
[17:15:42] <codyrobbins> But the object is being used elsewhere and the method being called on the object from different code paths now needs to be different because 'this' changes to a collection when called with the jQuery plugin.
[17:16:21] <codyrobbins> Wait, as I'm saying it I'm realizing it wouldn't be a jQuery object if it was just the object itself.
[17:18:45] <ray24> Dude I'm so tired man
[17:18:52] <ray24> I think I could pass out and never wake up ever game
[17:19:01] <ray24> again
[17:19:16] <dwarder> what is prefered plugin for autocomplite?
[17:21:03] <ray24> I'd use mozilla firefox
[17:21:06] <dwarder> !autocomplite
[17:21:07] <ray24> for autocomplite
[17:21:30] <dwarder> what do you mean?
[17:21:40] <dwarder> i asked about jquery plugin
[17:21:44] <ray24> rofl
[17:22:12] <ray24> That was pretty funny
[17:22:16] <ray24> I started laughing
[17:22:18] <dwarder> not at all
[17:22:20] <ray24> lol
[17:22:28] <ray24> anyways, so..
[17:22:28] <dwarder> you are just on weed or somehing
[17:22:33] <ray24> nah dude i dont smoke
[17:22:36] <ray24> I'm perfectly  sober
[17:24:22] <ray24> yo dwarder how old r u
[17:25:36] <ray24> i asked u a Q bro..gimmie the A
[17:27:37] <juanfra> Hi. I'm a newbie in jquery and javascript. I need a array with multiple values for each key. What is the specific documentation for this functionality?. Thanks.
[17:28:41] <ray24> yeah you really are a nwbie
[17:28:46] <ray24> LOL
[17:31:13] <ussher_> :)  juanfra:  each key is only going to be able to have 1 value.  im not sure if js allows each of those values to be an array though, but if it does then that might be what your after.
[17:31:34] <ray24> how do i get admin status here
[17:31:45] <ray24> I'm thinking about taking responsibility for my actions
[17:32:00] <GeoDud> ^ fdisk
[17:32:05] <ray24> ?
[17:32:10] <ray24> fdisk = f*** this?
[17:32:14] <ray24> rofl
[17:32:16] <GeoDud> no
[17:32:20] <ray24> oh
[17:32:21] <ray24> sorry
[17:32:41] <GeoDud> serious bizness here
[17:32:46] <ray24> k dudde
[17:32:47] <ray24> my bad
[17:33:07] <ray24> if u got admin privaledge, u let me know
[17:33:12] <ray24> cuz i got courage to run this channel
[17:34:12] <dwarder> so i guess autocomplete is best with jquery ui?
[17:35:02] <ray24> I believe your guess is equally probable to my guess
[17:35:11] <ray24> So I guess yes, therefore, your guess is also a yes
[17:35:14] <ray24> equates
[17:35:40] <ray24> but i swear.. I've seen you somewhere before dwarder.so i dont want to be too sure.
[17:35:51] <juanfra> ussher_: Other languages use a list as value because this I'm asking for documentation. Thanks :)
[17:37:42] <ussher_> juanfra: im better with php but need to learn js.  in php you could have a single array with keys then another array (with its own keys) as the values of that top array.  not sure if you can/cant in js, but it sounded like what you were after.
[17:38:04] <dwarder> nobody ever use autocomplete?
[17:38:08] <dwarder> used*
[17:38:12] <GeoDud> which one?
[17:38:20] <dwarder> what stuff do you guys use?
[17:38:35] <dwarder> GeoDud: i need to chose one
[17:38:39] <dwarder> GeoDud: please suggest
[17:38:54] <dwarder> with remote data
[17:39:00] <dwarder> and scrollable
[17:39:00] <GeoDud> hmm I think I am using the jQUery UI one
[17:39:06] <dwarder> i see
[17:39:07] <juanfra> ussher_: yes, python and perl has this
[17:39:08] <ray24> I autocompleted myself last night in bed
[17:40:13] <__name__> can i somehow catch a drag on a canvas on a smartphone?
[17:40:17] <ray24> LMAO
[17:40:21] <ray24> that sounded hilarious dude
[17:40:29] <__name__> i.e. prevent the default behaviour (scrolling).
[17:40:38] <danieliser> I need a method to save sortable tabs - each has a sortable list - each list item has a set of options.. any ideas of how this could be saved to be rebuilt later?
[17:40:53] <ray24> Sorry, I cannot provide you with any information that breaches IRC integrity contract
[17:41:21] <__name__> ray24: Not meaning to be invasive, but â€” have you drunk? :)
[17:41:22] <ussher_> juanfra: here is somthing close: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1733678/writing-multidemisional-array-jquery
[17:41:34] <ray24> LMAO
[17:41:36] <ray24> drunk?
[17:41:37] <ray24> no.
[17:41:47] <ray24> I dont drink , do drugs, snort coke out of a whale's ass either
[17:41:53] <ray24> I'm sober and I'm completely intelligent.
[17:42:11] <__name__> But you seem whalophile.
[17:42:14] <ray24> If you're going to insult me that way, I will contact higher order to have you be dealt with.
[17:42:24] <__name__> ray24: Higher order functions?
[17:42:24] <ray24> How dare you
[17:42:56] <__name__> ray24: map, fold and filter will make the least of me.
[17:42:57] <danieliser> can something like that multi dimensional array be passed to php?
[17:45:18] <ussher_> How do i select just the first "day_elapsed" class? http://jsfiddle.net/pzsLU/  clicking on the 00:27:00 will turn ALL the items in the "elapsed" column to "Hello".  how can i target only the immediate row above?
[17:45:42] <ray24> usher thinks he's a rapper lol
[17:46:17] <ussher_> or maybe the rapper thinks hes me....
[17:46:32] <__name__> Or it's a coincidence!
[17:46:46] <__name__> I do not think I am a name, neither do names think they are me, I guess.
[17:46:50] <juanfra> ussher_: thanks for the link :)
[17:48:27] <ussher_> danieliser: looks possible via post (or get too maybe) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2433727/submitting-a-multidimensional-array-via-post-with-php
[17:50:04] <danieliser> ussher_: basically im making a drag/drop form maker.. each tab represents a different page of the form..each panel includes sortable divs with field options attatched to each.. array is the only way i can think of to save and rebuild the forms
[17:52:20] <ussher_> danieliser: im not so clever with JS yet.  there are much smarter people in here.  But if you want help with it i find making working examples so everyone can see helps everyone understand and able to help you.  jsfiddle.com is good too.
[17:54:06] <ussher_> danieliser:  do you need to save all the info ON the form each time the form is moved, or just the location of the form.  Im thinking one DB table for the order and a separate one for the info.
[17:54:08] <danieliser> ussher_: yea i usually do.. just a complicated project and i havent been stuck that long yet.. will probably do that if multi dem arrays dont pan out
[17:55:15] <ussher_> that way you dont need to pass a multidimentional array, just a normal array
[17:55:59] <danieliser> ussher_: that sounds like a good idea.. save the individual fields when they are modified.
[17:57:02] <thebignoise> $.fn.simpleNav = function(settings) {} -- is there another syntax for this?
[17:57:14] <thebignoise> w/ out the =
[17:57:16] <cook1es> Using Opera, I get "Uncaught exception: ReferenceError: Undefined variable: unsafeWindow", how do I define it or whatever?
[17:58:08] <danieliser> ussher_: thinking maybe 3 tables.. 1: field_relationships (includes pageId) 2: field options(includes each fields options probably serialized since each field will have different available options) and 3: sorting
[17:59:49] <jaequery> what does this mean?  ratio[i][type] /= totals[type];
[17:59:56] <danieliser> ussher_: thinking about it that way makes what i need to do much simpler..
[18:00:23] <jaequery> i never seen an /= operator before
[18:01:09] <ussher_> danieliser: im not sure how you have it set up, but for sort order i would probably do something like table_name.id table_name.weight table_name.label  and the sort the order on the weights.  heaver further to the right lighter to the left
[18:01:33] <ussher_> and increment them in 100's so you can always juggle them around and add stuff if necessary
[18:01:49] <ussher_> got to go away for a skype meeting for abit.  back later
[18:06:44] <ray24> skype meeting sounds hi-tech
[18:06:52] <ray24> Seems like a moment to get really shy
[18:07:01] <ray24> and self conscious about yourself
[18:16:08] <dwarder> is there a plugin for chrome that will show all ajax interactions??
[18:19:51] <thebignoise> http://collabedit.com/qggte -- can someone help me. i don't really know where to go from here
[18:20:07] <thebignoise> how do i use the settings i create?
[18:22:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[18:22:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> i want to do some dom scanning/finding/selecting to html someone pastes into a textarea
[18:23:09] <danieliser> anybody gotten sortable droppable tabs working? i can get one or the other but not both..
[18:23:10] <ProLoser|Mobile> how do i make the contents of the textarea my... 'workspace'?
[18:24:03] <drd> ProLoser|Mobile: $('<div class="workspace"></div>').html($('textarea#foo')[0].innerHTML)
[18:26:31] <ProLoser|Mobile> drd: not working http://jsfiddle.net/B2ULs/
[18:27:11] <opra> Hi, does anyone know of a strategy to parse text as i type in a search bar, so that when i type a "#" before a word that specific word is rendered in a different color?
[18:28:16] <ProLoser|Mobile> drd: nvm
[18:31:14] <GeoDud> @opra think it would be a pain to make the color change while you're still editing that same word
[18:31:29] <GeoDud> you could do some kind of div overlay thing like http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin
[18:33:47] <opra> GeoDud: the colour would only change for a NEW word (ie after a space) if "#" was before the word. so :" regular colour #thisinblue"
[18:36:58] <GeoDud> how about capturing key press events and sticking their results in a styled div that looks like an input textbox - because you can't have multiple text colors in a real input box
[18:38:27] <larzen> question....when creating a plugin..where do I put in my "chore" methods? inside of return this.each(function() { ?
[18:46:12] <GeoDud> @opra check this out, uses contenteditable attr: http://jsfiddle.net/B7HXh/
[18:47:38] <opra> Geodud:thanks
[18:48:55] <larzen> anyone?? I am creating a new plugin and I want to add more methods to it...
[18:49:39] <larzen> do i put my methods inside of return this.each(function()....?
[18:51:44] <misterm> larzen: can you be more specific?
[18:52:30] <misterm> larzen: like, what do you want to add more methods to? what do the methods do? how will they be called?
[18:52:37] <miketaylr> larzen: there's about a billion tutorials on writing jquery plugins
[18:53:39] <miketaylr> larzen: start here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:58:18] <larzen> miketaylr: I have the basic skeleton of my plugin...
[18:58:38] <larzen> miketaylr: I see that all those demos have the functionality here: return this.each(function() { .. STUFF HAPPENS HERE ..}
[18:59:01] <larzen> miketaylr: I am curious if that is where I should be putting my own custom functions?
[18:59:13] <larzen> like chore functions like algorithms and such...
[18:59:28] <miketaylr> did you read http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ?
[18:59:35] <miketaylr> because it kind of depends
[18:59:39] <misterm> larzen: it depends...
[18:59:46] <larzen> miketaylr: yes I did... and I am still unclear.
[18:59:58] <misterm> larzen: in general your plugin will all be housed in a giant function
[19:00:09] <misterm> larzen: so you probably want to put your utility functions in that
[19:00:27] <larzen> misterm: so I have ... floorPlan: function(options) { .....
[19:00:52] <larzen> and inside of that I have... var defaults = { ..  .. var options = $.extend(defaults, options); .. and finally ... return this.each(function() {
[19:01:16] <misterm> larzen: your question is too broad and hard to answer without context
[19:02:59] <aoeu256_> in jquery how do you navigate and edit through the DOM recursively like reversing each word individually (the individual elements of contents() don't seem to support contents() )
[19:03:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[19:03:33] <ProLoser|Mobile> i need to select a child element that has sub-child with a specific value
[19:03:47] <larzen> misterm: OK let me paste this.. very easy
[19:05:43] <larzen> misterm: Check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/XJbay/
[19:07:38] <misterm> larzen: it reall depends on what the functions do and how they're called
[19:08:07] <larzen> misterm: I presume the entry point for this plugin is in here: return this.each(function() {
[19:08:15] <misterm> larzen: you could put them before $.fn.extend...you can put them inside your floorPLan function
[19:08:31] <misterm> larzen: it depends on what you mean by "entry point"
[19:08:41] <larzen> and most of my functions will be INTERNAL at this point, meaning, not called from outside of the plugin by a "user"
[19:08:48] <larzen> they are simpley chore functions to do some math with.
[19:08:50] <misterm> larzen: but that's the function that takes each element in the jQuery object and does whatever to them
[19:09:11] <larzen> misterm: each element? not the one specified by the selector?
[19:09:12] <misterm> imho, you should keep it as clean as possible, but you could put functions in there
[19:09:31] <larzen> by entry point i mean, where does the execution thread begin
[19:09:35] <misterm> larzen: that's what I'm talking about
[19:09:58] <misterm> larzen: the selector tells jQuery what elements you want, and you get a jQuery object that holds a list of elements
[19:09:59] <larzen> (sorry I am normally a device driver / kernel developer... javascript and jquery is new for me =)
[19:10:20] <misterm> larzen: one thing to think about is that the callback function for each will run a bunch of times
[19:10:32] <larzen> misterm: oh I see. so return this.each(function() { will be executed for EACH object that the selector returns.
[19:10:39] <misterm> larzen: if you define a function in there, they will be created each time the function runs
[19:10:59] <larzen> misterm: that's probably not a good idea (to define functions in there)
[19:11:14] <misterm> larzen: there migh be a reason to create a function in there, but yea in general it's probably not where you want to put them
[19:11:52] <larzen> misterm: so I want to put them inside of floorplan: function(options) { instead... correct?
[19:12:17] <misterm> larzen: you can, you could also put them inside the closure that holds your plugin
[19:12:39] <larzen> you mean inside here: $.fn.extend({ .. HERE ?
[19:13:37] <misterm> larzen: yea
[19:14:30] <larzen> mistream then I simply invoke them this way myFunction(someArg, someArg..)
[19:14:40] <larzen> there is no need for "this." or anything like that.. correct?
[19:15:16] <misterm> larzen: no, not unless you attach them to something
[19:44:55] <saddishwasher> hey all

[19:47:53] <saddishwasher> am I the only person that doesn't see your display name?
[19:52:40] <saddishwasher> not a lot of issues out tonight...
[19:56:08] <deanclkclk> do u guys really answer questions?
[19:59:12] <k4ndar> hay tehre
[19:59:22] <lastk> deanclkclk : I hope so
[19:59:53] <deanclkclk> which one is better JQuery or Dojo?
[19:59:58] <conorp> Hi
[20:00:47] <conorp> Okay the site is http://www.bimbadeenbrangus.com/ - I'm having issues with the About Us dropdown menu
[20:07:42] <ProLoser|Mobile> hello
[20:07:45] <ProLoser|Mobile> need some help
[20:09:29] <ProLoser|Mobile> how do i select an element with a child element that contains a specific text?
[20:14:52] <saddishwasher> ProLoser|Mobile, you would assign the element you want to select a class or an ID and put it in a selector tag like this $("#my_element_id")
[20:15:15] <ProLoser|Mobile> saddishwasher: can't
[20:15:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm parsing xml
[20:15:23] <saddishwasher> wwwhhhhyyyy
[20:15:40] <misterm> ProLoser|Mobile: well it depends, but probably you would iterate through parent.children()
[20:15:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> god that sounds horrible
[20:15:54] <misterm> ProLoser|Mobile: and just check for the text you want
[20:15:57] <saddishwasher> ProLoser|Mobile, thats important to include in the primary question
[20:16:30] <misterm> ProLoser|Mobile: what exactly do you expect?
[20:16:54] <saddishwasher> ?hi5 @ misterm
[20:16:55] <bot-t> misterm, âµ
[20:17:12] <saddishwasher> lol I love the hi 5
[20:17:48] <misterm> ProLoser|Mobile: jQuery does have some ability to select on attribute, but the way I understand your question basically the most straightforward way is to simply iterate through them
[20:18:23] <ProLoser|Mobile> since it's not an attribute... ya... seems like it... unfortunately
[20:18:26] <ProLoser|Mobile> gawd
[20:19:05] <lastk> hey guys I have this element: e = $('.something').last(); this is a div with some inputs, how can I iterate by they inputs?
[20:19:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> so i can't put in an advanced selector in .has() ??
[20:19:49] <ProLoser|Mobile> lastk: did you check the docs on iteration?
[20:19:53] <ProLoser|Mobile> or selecting inputs?
[20:19:58] <lastk> ProLoser|Mobile : yep
[20:20:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> and your conclusion is?
[20:20:08] <lastk> but I cant do something like : $('inputs') ;
[20:20:19] <ProLoser|Mobile> why not?
[20:20:20] <lastk> I need something like e.('inputs');
[20:20:20] <misterm> ProLoser|Mobile: if you can express the criteria for the element you want as a selector, you can do .has()
[20:20:24] <saddishwasher> lastk, $('.something:last-child input').each(function(){ };
[20:20:31] <ProLoser|Mobile> what's e?
[20:20:49] <lastk> ProLoser|Mobile : a element received.
[20:21:18] <saddishwasher> lastk, or e.find('input').each(function(){ };
[20:21:18] <lastk> saddishwasher : yes, but the last was just a example ;( I cant know the position
[20:21:23] <lastk> ahh cool
[20:21:24] <lastk> find
[20:21:28] <lastk> let me see
[20:21:46] <lastk> nice
[20:22:44] <saddishwasher> lastk, work?
[20:23:06] <lastk> yep
[20:23:11] <lastk> saddishwasher : thank you
[20:24:25] <saddishwasher> lastk, np

[22:20:17] <perverse> hey guys, i i'm having a bit of an issue with hovers, z-index, the DOM and a show/hide sliding effect inside an element: http://jsfiddle.net/rHv68/
[22:20:31] <perverse> when you mouse over the element, the menu at the bottom slides in
[22:20:47] <perverse> this is all well and good, but when you mouseover from the bottom in firefox, the slide keeps on bouncing in and out
[22:21:16] <coldhead> ?ba debounce
[22:21:17] <bot-t> Don't fire that event any more than you have to! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[22:21:22] <coldhead> perverse: ^^
[22:21:22] <perverse> now im assuming this is because in firefox, the .actions-hover div at the bottom is taking mouseover focus away from .Element - which is the parent
[22:21:37] <perverse> thank you muchly :)
[22:21:42] <perverse> :)~~~
[22:22:36] <magcius> perverse, couldn't you just stop the event from bubbling?
[22:23:07] <perverse> i'm honestly not sure, it's why i asked :)
[22:23:19] <Assimilater> can anyone help me get this sortable working? it doesn't appear that i can move the buttons... http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/1/
[22:24:48] <perverse> magcius - what would be involved in preventing the event from bubbling, as you say?
[22:25:06] * magcius is trying stuff
[22:25:14] <perverse> i'll certainly use the debounce plugin, have no problem with that, but if there's a "cleaner" solution, i'm certainly intriguied
[22:25:46] <perverse> what i find interesting is that other browsers seem to understand that the .actions-hover is a descendant of .Element
[22:26:03] <perverse> chrome certainly doesnt mind
[22:27:08] <magcius> perverse, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/rHv68/1/
[22:27:21] <magcius> perverse, right, how event bubbling works is different across browsers.
[22:27:35] <perverse> very nice magcius
[22:28:01] <perverse> ahh, didn't think to binding the false to .actions-hover xD
[22:28:19] * perverse tips hat, your js wizardry is appreciated good sir :)
[22:29:37] <perverse> hmm ok
[22:29:37] <Sora_> hiya
[22:29:41] <perverse> the main thing with that one magcius
[22:29:54] <perverse> is that when you enter the mouse through the bottom of .Element, and exit the mouse through the bottom
[22:29:59] <perverse> the control panel stays in place :(~
[22:30:09] <perverse> which isn't ideal behaviour, although is an improvement, lol
[22:30:51] <magcius> perverse, inter-child hover relationships are complex. Read quirksmode.
[22:31:58] <perverse> hmm will do magcius, thanks for your help
[22:32:36] <magcius> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_mouse.html
[22:32:42] <magcius> read about target/srcElement and such
[22:32:49] <magcius> no idea if jQuery tries to normalize those
[22:32:58] <perverse> kk :)
[22:33:30] <perverse> the problem may even be jquery in this instance, i think jquery will pass the mouseover event up to its parent or something
[22:34:01] <perverse> perhaps even all the way up the dom
[22:34:17] <magcius> perverse, that's standard event bubbly.
[22:34:18] <magcius> bubbling.
[22:34:21] <perverse> ah k
[22:34:23] <magcius> The browsers do that.
[22:34:28] <magcius> You prevent it by returning false.
[22:34:33] <perverse> i'm not overly sharp on js event handling
[22:34:39] <magcius> it's complicated
[22:38:39] <datarecall> is there a loop i can do to hide each #right-content on the page ?
[22:39:49] <magcius> datarecall, "each #right-content"?
[22:39:52] <magcius> I hope you said that wrong.
[22:41:39] <datarecall> yeah i know there are not supposed to be more then one div
[22:41:44] <datarecall> just playing with some stuff
[22:41:45] <magcius> ...
[22:41:49] <magcius> you mean more than one id.
[22:41:52] <magcius> use a class instead
[22:42:07] <magcius> is there an eaiser way to load javascript into a page than injecting script tags?
[22:42:29] <perverse> lol define "easier"
[22:43:40] <perverse> what i want is __autoload for my js
[22:43:41] <datarecall> magcius how would you loop over the classes trying to find an example here all i see is Jquery.each
[22:43:55] <perverse> someone has probably built it... i should look..
[22:44:23] <magcius> perverse, no, ES has no such feature unless you want to go mozilla-specific and define a getter on window.
[22:44:35] <magcius> datarecall, $(".right-content").hide()
[22:44:45] <perverse> daw :<
[22:46:02] <Assimilater> can anyone help me get this sortable working? it doesn't appear that i can move the buttons... http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/1/
[22:47:27] <perverse> is declaring an anchor for the drag a dependancy?
[22:47:33] <perverse> like, verbosely?
[22:48:11] <perverse> sorry not an anchor
[22:48:12] <perverse> a handle
[22:49:15] <magcius> Assimilater, can you tell me what's wrong, and strip it down to a minimal test case?
[22:49:26] <magcius> also stop spamming that link over and over?
[22:49:45] <magcius> for instance, what the hell am I supposed to do?
[22:50:07] <perverse> lol, yeah it's kinda hard to ascertain what's going on
[22:50:15] <Assimilater> magcius: that is a minimalist case...the buttons on the right are not draggable
[22:50:22] <Assimilater> i'm trying to make it so the user can define a sorting order
[22:50:24] <magcius> Assimilater, why should they be?
[22:50:36] <Assimilater> because i made the ul they are in .sortable()?
[22:50:47] <magcius> sortable != draggable
[22:51:00] <Assimilater> well draggable but snap in right place
[22:51:01] <magcius> a minimal testcase means no images
[22:51:03] <Assimilater> they are meant to be sort
[22:51:17] <magcius> a minimal testcase means no external dependencies
[22:51:29] <magcius> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://callserver.dyndns.biz:81/JQuery_Theme/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:51:39] <magcius> Don't do that, jsfiddle already provides jQuery for you.
[22:51:48] <Assimilater> i never got it to work on jsfiddle any other way
[22:52:13] <magcius> Assimilater, sorry I can't help you then. Stop spamming your link, build an extremely minimal testcase, and let us know what you want to be able to do.
[22:52:14] <perverse> you should only need to strip out the bare minimum markup Assimilater - just the ul with its children should be plenty
[22:52:25] <magcius> The buttons probably aren't draggable because you don't have code to make them draggable.
[22:52:33] <perverse> possibly a tad of css to keep a bit of structure about things
[22:53:24] <Assimilater> sigh
[22:53:36] <Assimilater> by strip out you're asking me to strip out the head as well?
[22:53:46] <Assimilater> which is the only way i've EVER gotten jquery and jquery ui to work on jsfiddle?
[22:53:56] <Assimilater> (i'm all but convinced the checkboxes on the left don't work)
[22:54:02] <ipwa> I have a 'fake' dropdown that uses jquery, the toggle works well, but I'd like the dropdown to close when a user clicks outside of the dropdown, is that possible?
[22:54:15] <ipwa> here is an example of what I have in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/YGczt/15/
[22:55:39] <ipwa> If I use .click() on the body to .hide() the dropdown I can't open it again
[22:55:42] <ipwa> any ideas?
[22:56:14] <magcius> Assimilater, no.. I'm asking you to strip out the images, things like the <html> tag and such
[22:56:23] <perverse> and magcius - thanks again for all your help mate... the bug i described with the one you built me was simple to fix with a bit of reading - i just had to make sure that the mouseout on the action bar did bubble, but the mouseover didn't bubble :)~~
[22:56:28] <magcius> you basically pasted a pile of junk code to me and said "WHY DOESN'T IT WORK?"
[22:56:33] <magcius> perverse, :)
[22:57:02] <ndee> hey guys, when writing a jquery plugin and I want to test if css transformations are available, should I then use modernizr in that plugin or test it somehow else?
[22:57:44] <Assimilater> speak of the devil maybe they fixed issues since i last tried...it's not giving me console errors about "jquery not defined"
[22:58:37] <Assimilater> this is as minimalist as i've ever gone, i hope it's good enough: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/3/
[23:09:36] <magcius> Assimilater, OK
[23:09:51] <magcius> Assimilater, you're expecting to be able to drag "Last", "First", and "Total" around?
[23:10:18] <Assimilater> in place
[23:10:22] <Assimilater> essentially change the order
[23:10:26] <Assimilater> not just drag anywhere randomly
[23:10:30] <Assimilater> which i why i'm not going for draggable
[23:15:06] <magcius> Assimilater, oh, you're using <input> elements
[23:15:10] <magcius> those have weird semantics
[23:15:34] <magcius> Assimilater, you can try using a button elements
[23:17:06] <Assimilater> does it matter for the sortable?
[23:17:15] <Assimilater> the semantics are weird because of the info they pass to php
[23:17:25] <Assimilater> and my first attempt was with butotn elements
[23:17:38] <Assimilater> my use of .val didn't work so i used inputs
[23:18:26] <magcius> Assimilater, see:
[23:18:31] <magcius> button elements don't work either
[23:18:33] <magcius> btw
[23:18:41] <magcius> you may be able to fake out the event handling, I don't know
[23:18:44] <magcius> http://jsfiddle.net/vXHbc/4/
[23:18:53] <magcius> notice how you can drag the text node around but not the button
[23:19:32] <Assimilater> i see....
[23:19:44] * Assimilater has a hard time comprehending why it would matter...
[23:20:02] <magcius> Assimilater, events on forms is complicated
[23:20:43] <Assimilater> well i'm not trying to put this on a form....
[23:20:47] <Assimilater> just a button
[23:21:16] <SpaceghostC2C> Assimilater: Have you tried a input with a type of button?
[23:21:35] <Assimilater> see revision 3 (that's what i am using)
[23:22:21] <Assimilater> url since it has my username: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/3/
[23:25:03] <Assimilater> ah....
[23:25:11] <Assimilater> this seems like it works
[23:25:14] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/7/
[23:25:52] <Assimilater> i'll just have to use html or text instead of value
[23:25:57] <Assimilater> val()
[23:26:58] <Assimilater> nope doesn't like that...
[23:27:07] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/10/
[23:28:11] <Assimilater> oh...
[23:28:14] <Assimilater> i think i know why...
[23:29:26] <Assimilater> while maybe not the most ideal approach this seems like it will work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/10/
[23:30:23] <Assimilater> what do you think magcius?
[23:30:37] <magcius> Assimilater, sure, that works
[23:32:40] <Assimilater> now what's up with the highlight?
[23:33:32] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vXHbc/12/
[23:33:38] <Assimilater> and the spacing....
[23:36:58] <Assimilater> well that's enough for me for tonight
[23:37:01] <Assimilater> g'night
