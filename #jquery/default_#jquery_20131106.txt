[01:14:14] <Haraldson> Struggling with sortable/draggable/droppable. My sortable list is also a droppable, allowing list items from other parts of the page. However, I don't get any data about the context where the draggable was dropped, neither from sortable's receive event nor from droppable's drop event
[01:14:42] <Haraldson> I guess this use case isn't too uncommon, so it baffles me that jQUI doesn't provide this info in some way
[01:14:44] <Haraldson> any pointers?
[01:15:23] <Haraldson> that is, I do get what droppable something was dropped onto, but not the internal index
[01:20:32] <intellix> any difference in performance/etc between: $('.something', form); and form.find('.something') ?
[01:20:40] <intellix> I'm guessing find is just chainable
[01:22:29] <Cork> intellix: not in a meaning full difference no
[01:22:50] <Cork> intellix: $() has the generic function wrapper before it calls .find, but it doens't really matter
[01:23:05] <Cork> $('.something', form) internally calls form.find('.something')
[01:23:11] <Cork> so the code doing the work is the same
[01:23:41] <intellix> so using $() just has the overhead of the $() wrapper, which isn't worth worrying about performance
[01:23:47] <Cork> yes
[01:24:03] <intellix> I guess I prefer .find() as it's easier to read, see what's going on, chainable
[01:24:18] <Cork> the part where it checks what arguments are what before it calls the.find on the second argument
[01:24:47] <Cork> intellix: ya, i think so too
[01:25:15] <Cork> i usually only use the $() wrapper for wrapping dom elements, selectors and the ready call
[01:25:24] <Cork> it normally makes the code more readable
[01:26:19] <intellix> cool, thanks :D
[01:28:03] <Haraldson> is there a better place to ask jquery ui questions, than here?
[01:28:35] <Cork> Haraldson: no
[01:30:59] <duchman> hi all,I have a mysql table in div myztable but $("#myztable").load("replypub.php #myztable"); show blank page
[01:31:04] <duchman> any help pls?
[01:35:51] <Cork> duchman: an mysql table?
[01:35:51] <Cork> you can't have mysql in html
[01:36:53] <Cork> you mean you have an html table generated from database data?
[01:40:08] <duchman> yea
[01:40:40] <Cork> and if you load replypub.php you see the id="myztable" table in there?
[01:40:57] <Cork> btw load loads the element matching the id, not just the content
[01:41:04] <Cork> so you need to separate the container and the target
[01:41:17] <Cork> (or just have the server send a fragment instead of a full page)
[01:41:41] <duchman> how do I send a fragment?
[01:41:55] <Cork> you have a php file that just sends the part of the page you want
[01:42:09] <Cork> or you could use a $_GET parameter to check if you should do that filtering
[01:42:29] <Cork> then you can just do $("#myztable").load("replypub-partial.php")
[01:42:48] <Cork> and to not duplicate the code you can just require it in the full page
[01:43:02] <duchman> ok...but will I get the bits I want?
[01:43:17] <Cork> duchman: if you send the bits in the partial, ya
[01:43:33] <duchman> ok let me test it now
[01:43:34] <Cork> but it depends on the server actually sending the correct data
[01:52:29] <duchman> Cork: I used the  $("#myztable").load("replypub-partial.php") but it is not loading
[01:52:45] <Cork> duchman: do you have a server file with that name?
[01:52:53] <Cork> and does it actually send the html you want back?
[01:53:20] <duchman> ok....
[01:53:33] <duchman> one sec
[01:54:29] <duchman> Cork:can I pm u?
[01:54:37] <Cork> preferably not
[01:54:42] <Cork> what is it about?
[01:54:57] <duchman> ok.......let me use pastebin
[01:55:04] <duchman> one sec pls
[01:58:23] <wathek> hi everybody
[01:58:43] <wathek> is there any jquery plugin that create a carousel with zoom effect like in this link http://codecanyon.net/item/boutique-carousel/full_screen_preview/113093
[01:58:44] <wathek> ?
[01:58:54] <duchman> Cork:I got an instant msg site that update every 3secs from mysql but the problem is this..if a single php serves the chat php code and refresh every 3 secs.It changes chat displays across multiple windows
[02:00:15] <duchman> I need multiple chat windows to maintain their chat thread and not change to last msg received by the php code
[02:00:16] <mazzachre> Is there some way to find out of text-overflow: ellipsis is actually activly doing something? Or does it take comparing stuff before and after applying it?!
[02:00:34] <duchman> don't know if u get what I mean?
[02:00:36] <Ricaz> If I use ajax to load a page with <script> on it, how will that code be executed?
[02:01:05] <Ricaz> I mean if there are events on the buttons on the loaded page for example
[02:01:24] <Whiskey> Cork, did you see the work here yesterday?
[02:03:55] <Cork> Whiskey: don't think so, was quite busy yesterday
[02:04:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/5/ <-- the box under you see there thats the expaxted result
[02:04:30] <Whiskey> you need to open it
[02:04:45] <Cork> what is the question?
[02:04:53] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/4/ <---that is how it looks whitout set it in CSS i need jQuery to set it for me everytime
[02:07:06] <Whiskey> someone in here helped me yeseterday and id this http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/6/ <-- the resize script in the end, but as you can see its get alot bigger then it need to be in example http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/5/
[02:07:22] <Whiskey> and i canÂ´t figure out why
[02:08:01] <Whiskey> Only thing i can think is that it reads something wrong
[02:08:14] <Ricaz> How do I undbind ALL click events on the page?
[02:08:38] <Whiskey> Ricaz talk to me?
[02:09:01] <Ricaz> Whiskey, what?
[02:09:09] <Whiskey> nothing
[02:09:16] <gurke_> is there a channel for jquery-ui-carousel?
[02:09:41] <gurke_> i need some help with it
[02:09:54] <Cork> Whiskey: i honestly don't understand why you use js for that at all
[02:10:45] <Whiskey> Cork cuz you canÂ´t do it any other way
[02:11:01] <Cork> Whiskey: you can't?
[02:11:04] <Whiskey> if you will have the tds equal sized to the biggest one
[02:11:04] <Cork> i bet you can
[02:11:32] <Whiskey> Cork the infromation are diffrent, so it need to be unversial
[02:11:34] <Haraldson> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19809223/jquery-ui-sortable-draggable-droppable-combo-index-of-dropped-draggable-in-sor
[02:11:53] <Whiskey> Cork, go ahead and show me i have try to find something whitout JS for almost a year
[02:12:10] <Cork> Whiskey: i think we had this discussion last time too
[02:12:31] <Whiskey> yeh maybe :)
[02:12:41] <Cork> but it really is doable, and i really don't have time to put on it while i'm working
[02:12:56] <Cork> but css can do those things
[02:13:14] <gurke_> what are you trying to do Whiskey
[02:13:24] <Whiskey> the question is why the JS make it bigger it reads something wrong
[02:13:40] <rved> using jquery UI... tooltip. Having problem: sometimes the normal 'title' attribute shows instead of the tooltip on a mouse hover.. any idea's? http://paste2.org/avOmOEOW
[02:14:05] <Whiskey> gurke_, get same size of the tds in the box in http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/6/ the espected result is http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/5/
[02:14:22] <Whiskey> it is equal sized, but get alot bigger then it should
[02:16:29] <gurke_> looks fine to me
[02:16:59] <Whiskey> no
[02:17:13] <Whiskey> gurke_: did you open the box in http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/5/?
[02:17:24] <gurke_> yes
[02:17:55] <Whiskey> ok its fine thats how it should be ok
[02:18:05] <Whiskey> that is CSS
[02:18:07] <Whiskey> here is JS
[02:18:14] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/svDwq/6/ <--- does it looks same to you?
[02:18:27] <gurke_> its exactly the same
[02:18:39] <Whiskey> no its alot more width right?
[02:18:54] <rved> using jquery UI... tooltip. Having problem: sometimes the normal 'title' attribute shows instead of the tooltip on a mouse hover.. any idea's? http://paste2.org/avOmOEOW

[02:32:07] <kiki67100> can I help me ?
[02:35:50] <Haraldson> can you, kiki67100 ?

[02:37:07] <Haraldson> so you save to server and get the data back in the response?

[03:07:20] <45PAAI89G> i am triggering click event by class. How can i get element id on click event triggered over class?
[03:08:49] <45PAAI89G> for example, i have 3 buttons with same class and different id. What i wanted to get is. When i click one of the button, click event by class must triggered and get that button id.
[03:18:23] <Ankhwatcher> Hey should element.find() work for finding <img> tags? It's working for <div>'s but not for an <img>
[03:19:11] <xqo> hi, in javascript regex, can you do something like an OR symbol?
[03:19:55] <xqo> so if i wanted start of string, or $ or â‚¬ i could do something like ^|$|â‚¬  (assuming | was the or symbol) ?
[03:23:17] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: .find works as long as your looking for an element that is a child of element
[03:24:05] <Cork> xqo: /(^|\$|€)/ should work
[03:24:34] <Cork> depending on what else you want to match though
[03:25:43] <xqo> Corey
[03:26:12] <xqo> sorry, Cork: I'm trying to match either of these: $123 â‚¬123 123,-
[03:26:44] <Cork> is there anything else in those strings?
[03:27:09] <Ankhwatcher> Cork: here is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/ankhwatcher/Kxa5U/
[03:27:24] <Ankhwatcher> The console output shows: ReferenceError: image is not defined
[03:27:31] <xqo> well the number is not 123, its generated. and nothing else
[03:28:12] <Cork> Ankhwatcher: where is item defined?
[03:28:41] <slax0r> xqo: use regex to get out the digits
[03:29:24] <xqo> slax0r ive been using /^(\d+)/ to match the 123,- one, but i need the expression to match $123 and â‚¬123 too
[03:29:38] <Ankhwatcher> item comes from json, I just noticed I have two things called item here
[03:30:51] <Cork> xqo: /[\$€]?\d++/ ?
[03:31:04] <Ankhwatcher> I've updated that jsfiddle to have the whole function
[03:31:05] <xqo> Cork what about â‚¬?
[03:31:14] <Cork> its in there :)
[03:31:47] <Cork> js> print('$123'.match(/[\$€]?[0-9]+/)[0])
[03:32:15] <Cork> oh, the bot is dead...
[03:32:45] <Cork> xqo: [\$€]? means match $, € or skip it
[03:32:49] <Ankhwatcher> oh I think I found it
[03:36:23] <xqo> Cork not working for $123 and â‚¬123
[03:36:42] <xqo> i thought this looked right /(^|\$\â‚¬)(\d+)[,-]$/ but apparently not
[03:36:59] <slax0r> xqo: don't know for js, but this one works in php: /[^\$|EUR](.+?)[^\.\-]/
[03:37:18] <Cork> xqo: 'a$123'.match(/[\$€]?\d+/)[0] works for me
[03:37:19] <slax0r> for all three, so $123, EUR123, 123.-
[03:37:25] <Cork> >>> 'a$123'.match(/[\$€]?\d+/)[0]
[03:37:25] <Cork> "$123"
[03:37:58] <Cork> xqo: the ? is important
[03:38:10] <Cork> else you would only match $ or € values
[03:38:26] <xqo> >>> $123'.match(/[\$|â‚¬]?(\d+)/)[0]
[03:38:34] <xqo> >>> '$123'.match(/[\$|â‚¬]?(\d+)/)[0]
[03:38:36] <Cork> there is no bot in this channel
[03:38:39] <xqo> oh
[03:39:16] <Cork> xqo: but if you just want the values why are you matching $€ ?
[03:39:45] <Cork> the extra () doens't make any sense unless you just want \d+
[03:39:55] <Cork> and then the $€ is pointless
[03:40:08] <xqo> i think i lied when i said there is no other text
[03:40:21] <Cork> then provide a valid example :)
[03:40:38] <Cork> xqo: also | isn't used in [] selectors
[03:41:27] <Cork> xqo: but provide a valid string for the matching
[03:41:32] <Cork> and then we can start from there
[03:42:12] <xqo> either $4096 $9812 or 500,-
[03:42:25] <Cork> those would all work with the selector i gave you
[03:42:54] <xqo> i want the number, but it cant just take any number from the text its looking through
[03:43:28] <xqo> Cork can you paste your regex somewhere. i think the â‚¬ symbol gets removed in my irc client
[03:43:35] <Cork> so the pure numer needs to end with ,-?
[03:43:40] <xqo> yes
[03:44:04] <xqo> its looking for prices, prices are listed as USD, EUR or NOK
[03:44:19] <xqo> ,- is the denominator for norwegian krone
[03:44:36] <Cork> "$4096 €9812 or 500,-".match(/([\$€]\d+|[^\$€]\d+,-)/g)
[03:47:05] <xqo> what is the g?
[03:47:27] <Cork> it's to match multiple values
[03:47:30] <Cork> you might not need it
[03:48:37] <xqo> theres not going to be both $ â‚¬ and ,- in one page. only one of each, it depends on the language-version of the page. this regex is for a sorting-function that sorts by price
[03:49:13] <Cork> ok then you can just remove the g
[03:49:40] <Cork> you can use /(?:[\$€](\d+)|[^\$€](\d+),-)/.exec("$4096")[1]
[03:49:48] <Cork> if you want just the number and not the symbols
[03:50:05] <gurke_> how do i set options in jquery-ui-carousel?
[03:50:28] <Cork> xqo: (note you can't use match for that)
[03:50:48] <jamk> anyone ever worked with jquery appear?
[03:51:15] <jamk> the delay works perfectly in chrome but is being ignored completely by mozilla
[03:54:10] <Cork> jamk: http://morr.github.io/appear.html works just fine in firefox and chrome for me
[04:01:45] <xqo> thanks Cork
[04:01:50] <Cork> np
[04:03:19] <xqo> how come the number is repeated twice here? http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/1/
[04:03:54] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/2/
[04:03:58] <Cork> cause you grab it twice
[04:06:59] <gurke_> can someone help me with jquery ui carousel??
[04:07:31] <xqo> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/3/ i thought .match(/asd(\d+)asd/) would return only the numbers?
[04:07:43] <jamk> Cork i am using the exact same page as reference, really odd
[04:07:48] <Cork> xqo: see my earlier comment :)
[04:08:01] <Cork> xqo: you need exec not match if you want to only get groups from it
[04:08:10] <xqo> Cork oh ok, thanks
[04:08:41] <Cork> jamk: never used the plugin, so can only tell from what there demo shows
[04:08:55] <jamk> Alright, ill figure it out. thanks anyway
[04:15:21] <xqo> Cork sorry for asking so much. http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/5/
[04:15:37] <xqo> wait, http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/6/
[04:16:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9RHLX/7
[04:16:26] <Cork> xqo: also your regex is wrong
[04:16:37] <Cork> you will allow |123 with that regex
[04:16:51] <Cork> remove the | in the range selector
[04:19:50] <xqo> how do you [] multiple characters?
[04:19:54] <xqo> [,-]
[04:57:51] <netAction> Hi! I have a function foo() that should be triggered somewhere completely else. What is the best way to do this?
[04:58:31] <netAction> $.trigger("startworking");
[04:58:44] <netAction> $.on("startworking" ... ?
[04:59:19] <seutje> sure
[04:59:32] <seutje> it's not a method on the jQuery object, but rather on jQuery collections though
[04:59:53] <seutje> so more like $(document).on('customeventname', foo)
[05:00:37] <netAction> So on is better than bind, I guess.
[05:08:00] <netAction> seutje: Works. Thanks!
[05:09:11] <seutje> netAction: on allows you to easily delegate it to a parent element, so u don't have to worry about the dynamic nature of your implementation
[05:09:57] <alex1989> Hey guys is it possible to get the difference between 2 selectors ? I mean If I do var a = $('html'); then 10s I do b = $('html');. Is it possible to get the difference between a and b? (The element added between my two call)
[05:10:20] <alex1989> 10s later*
[05:10:54] <netAction> a = b
[05:11:05] <netAction> You have to save the old DOM.
[05:11:14] <alex1989> I just want to get the new elements
[05:11:24] <netAction> Yes.
[05:12:05] <alex1989> ah I got what you meant
[05:12:16] <netAction> Mark all old elements or save the document tree.
[05:12:43] <seutje> it's just a diff between 2 arrays, really
[05:12:49] <alex1989> jquery return a refrence to an object and not a object?
[05:12:56] <alex1989> seutje: no it's not, selector are not array
[05:13:07] <seutje> u wanna string diff the selector?
[05:13:45] <netAction> alex1989: I guess you need access to the new elements?
[05:13:47] <alex1989> seutje: yep
[05:13:54] <alex1989> netAction: yes
[05:14:12] <netAction> OK. Then $('div').addClass("old");
[05:14:17] <seutje> var a = $('foo'); var b = $('bar'); var diff = []; jQuery.grep(a, function(el){ if (jQuery.inArray(el, b) === -1) { diff.push(el);} })
[05:14:35] <seutje> diff will be an array of elements that are in a but not in b
[05:14:59] <Cork> why not just a.not(b) ?
[05:15:06] <netAction> Later: $('div:not(.old)').css("color","red");
[05:15:10] <seutje> good point
[05:15:33] <seutje> guess there's no need to make this work for all array like stuff
[05:15:57] <alex1989> netAction: look like a tricky soluction to me adding a class to every single elements seems strange isn't it?
[05:17:05] <netAction> alex1989: Yes, but copying is no better.
[05:17:19] <netAction> (depending on the task)
[05:18:18] <seutje> Cork: actually, that would exclude all
[05:18:27] <alex1989> in fact is it possible to add an event handler where news elements are added ?
[05:18:45] <seutje> cause b contains a + some extra
[05:18:53] <Cork> so b.not(a)
[05:18:54] <netAction> alex1989: Already looked this up and did not find a solution.
[05:19:09] <reloadz> why i get back var error = "true", but ir ecexutes if(error = "false"); ???  http://pastebin.com/zuNywRe8
[05:19:43] <Cork> reloadz: why are you using strings instead of bools?
[05:20:08] <Cork> reloadz: but the post call is async
[05:20:14] <Cork> so it actually runs after the if cases you ahve
[05:20:18] <Cork> *have
[05:20:19] <seutje> reloadz: that's an assignment and not a condition
[05:20:29] <Cork> so var error = "false" is what you always check
[05:20:55] <seutje> which is always truthy unless something is severely broken
[05:21:24] <Cork> seutje: well he is checking error == "false"
[05:21:31] <Cork> though.. i don't see the point in using strings there
[05:21:36] <seutje> yeah, hadn't looked at the actual pastie
[05:23:42] <seutje> this feels like form validation, perhaps it could be interesting to look at established approaches
[05:23:44] <Justin_ZW> Hello, people. So I'm trying to make a script which will automatically add another input field when the first one is filled out. Being the poor soul who doesn't use javascript/jQuery very often, I'm stumbling in the dark with it. http://pastebin.com/PwH7J0CQ  That has the HTML of the form and the jQuery code that's supposed to add the next input.
[05:23:50] <Justin_ZW> Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?
[05:24:24] <Cork> Justin_ZW: i would recommend having the input field in html instead
[05:24:34] <Justin_ZW> It is HTML.
[05:24:40] <Cork> and just toggle it visible when the first one is filled
[05:24:48] <Justin_ZW> Oh you mean
[05:24:48] <Cork> no it is strings in javascript
[05:24:49] <Justin_ZW> I see.
[05:24:59] <Justin_ZW> lol now I gotcha.
[05:25:19] <Justin_ZW> So say, do <input (all that good stuff) style="display:none">
[05:25:28] <Cork> yes
[05:25:28] <Justin_ZW> And then just change the style with jQuery?
[05:25:30] <Cork> for example
[05:25:42] <Cork> $('#input2').show()
[05:26:01] <Justin_ZW> Hm.
[05:26:06] <Cork> Justin_ZW: also you should use label for labels
[05:26:08] <Cork> not <b>
[05:26:32] <Justin_ZW> Cork: What do you mean?
[05:26:55] <Cork> '<b>Via:</b> => '<label for="post-source">Via:</label>
[05:27:10] <Cork> ah
[05:27:18] <Cork> wait you want to infinitly add moew?
[05:27:20] <jamk> anyone mind providing me an example to work with? i am using http://morr.github.io/appear.html my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/MU6ST/
[05:27:20] <Cork> *more
[05:27:28] <Justin_ZW> Oh, no, just the first.
[05:27:36] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/5/ <-- why is that aint working, thinked set it in a var make it less messy
[05:27:38] <Justin_ZW> Although I will eventually add more on the user's demand.
[05:28:08] <Justin_ZW> (IE they click a button and it adds a new form.
[05:28:11] <Justin_ZW> )
[05:29:28] <Justin_ZW> Oh, poo, I have to run. Hold that thought and I'll be back in about 30-45 minutes. Sorry for the abrupt departure, but I have to meet a locksmith at my parents' house since they aren't home.
[05:31:41] <Cork> Justin_ZW: http://jsfiddle.net/ugKg3/
[05:31:44] <Cork> something like that
[05:36:15] <Cork> Justin_ZW: and with valid id's and names http://jsfiddle.net/ugKg3/1/
[05:43:44] <Ankhwatcher> How should I layer text over images in ListView entries? Is there anything in JQuery Mobile that can help?
[05:48:21] <fosser_josh> how to add dynamically click event for the same of buttons?
[05:49:15] <reloadz> Cork: seutje: thx
[05:49:17] <Cork> fosser_josh: delegate the click event
[05:49:34] <Cork> $('.parent').on('click', 'button', function() {})
[05:50:16] <Trudko> hi guys when to use map over the each ? i did simple test and map was slower http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-jquery-map
[05:51:27] <Cork> Trudko: you should never EVER do $().map on an array
[05:51:38] <Cork> or $().each for that matter
[05:52:32] <Trudko> ops true
[05:56:22] <seutje> Cork: used to have a coworker that kept using map as an iterator
[05:56:40] <Cork> lovely
[05:56:42] <grafi> that sounds perfectly reasonable to me seutje
[05:56:44] <grafi> xD
[05:56:55] <seutje> Toon, is that you? :P
[05:57:34] <grafi> stop talking shit about me on the internet ^^
[05:57:49] <Nomikos> Can I just replace every occurrence of .bind(..) with .on(..) in a script?
[05:59:03] <shoky> Nomikos: yeh
[05:59:14] <Nomikos> cool, ty
[05:59:37] <shoky> just don't generalize that to being true for other methods too
[05:59:45] <Trudko> Cork:  better http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-jquery-map ?
[05:59:58] <Nomikos> :)
[06:01:00] <Cork> Trudko: ya
[06:01:48] <Cork> wow
[06:01:53] <Cork> chrome really doens't like map
[06:02:26] <Cork> 800/900 in firefox and 400/900 in chrome >_>
[06:03:10] <Cork> Trudko: interesting find
[06:03:17] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to create "tabindex" on local div
[06:03:20] <seutje> Cork: getting different results in my firefox
[06:03:47] <Tomashe> so i will have 3 divs each got tabindex start from 1-4 and after u go the tabindex=4 it wont jump to the next div
[06:03:51] <seutje> oh wait, no, I just suck at reading comprehension
[06:05:59] <Trudko> Did I use the map correctly it this place?
[06:08:02] <fosser_josh> Cork: i am trying this code to get element id http://pastebin.com/6Fjk4HTh. But i am getting div id not the element id. I am trying adding buttons dynamically on click event and assigning click event to the newly added buttons. This is complete code http://pastebin.com/P6rnC6mX. I am trying to retrive button id on click event of button  which is dynamically created.
[06:09:40] <seutje> so... pastebin just died?
[06:10:01] <Cork> :)
[06:10:18] <seutje> fosser_josh: any chance u can paste that somewhere else? unless it was your code that broke it :P
[06:10:22] <Cork> yup
[06:11:09] <seutje> if that is the case, please don't paste it anywhere else, just print it and bury it in the back yard (or local park if you are tenant in a building)
[06:11:45] <Trudko> Cork, seutje btw http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-jquery-map in IE9 map is faster
[06:11:57] <Cork> heh
[06:12:03] <seutje> of course
[06:12:07] <Trudko> by 12 percent
[06:12:12] <seutje> when all the sense is done being made...
[06:12:12] <fosser_josh> seutje: thats nt what my code ment fr :p anyway which is other sites for pasting code?
[06:12:18] <Trudko> seutje: why of course because it is IE ? :)
[06:12:32] <Justin_ZW>  /away
[06:12:36] <seutje> ?paste
[06:12:38] <Justin_ZW> Fail
[06:12:40] <seutje> `[aste
[06:12:43] <seutje> ugh
[06:12:49] <Trudko> still my question is for what I wanted to do take some object and take one property from it and put it to array which then I use, i should use map right?
[06:12:54] <seutje> fosser_josh: pastie, jsfiddle, jsbin, ...
[06:13:22] <Cork> Trudko: if you want to build an array then yes use map
[06:13:32] <fosser_josh> seutje: http://pastie.org/8459698
[06:13:46] <fosser_josh> hope this will not died
[06:14:20] <Trudko> well but in ncase I showed which is really close to  real code  each is significantly faster...
[06:14:24] <seutje> $( "*", document.body ).click( <- prolly not what you were looking for
[06:14:58] <Justin_ZW> Cork: So that code will work without the need for an onKeyUp in the input form, right? That's the sort of thing that can just be scripted anywhere on the page?
[06:14:59] <fosser_josh> should it be layout_1?
[06:15:02] <seutje> fosser_josh: instead, just bind it to the body and use event.target instead of this
[06:15:28] <seutje> so it has 1 handler that does some checks instead of 786534287637846239 handlers
[06:15:37] <Cork> Justin_ZW: yes, that is how modern pages are written
[06:15:45] <seutje> yes, that number is exact and accurate!
[06:15:54] <Cork> Justin_ZW: with event listeners instead of event attributes
[06:16:06] <Justin_ZW> Good, good. I'm not even going to lie; I'm incredibly inexperienced at frontend development.
[06:16:22] <EugenA> is it possible to run a function in window 1 if window 2 has been closed?
[06:16:22] <seutje> anyone who tells you they are are probably lying anyway :P
[06:16:37] <Cork> Justin_ZW: that way you keep the code for handling the elements located in one place
[06:16:39] <Justin_ZW> (You can see PHP code I forgot to remove in the pastebin thing, too :P)
[06:16:51] <Cork> instead of spread out cross all the different html pages
[06:17:21] <Justin_ZW> Cork: That sounds efficient.
[06:17:28] <seutje> EugenA: u can run it right before closing, but isn't all that reliable, another possibility is checking for the window's existence every x seconds, which is a lot less clean, but you have more control
[06:17:36] <Cork> Justin_ZW: it is
[06:17:47] <seutje> this only applies if your page was the one spawning off that window
[06:17:51] <Justin_ZW> So an event handler is essentially when you tell a function to listen for a specific event on a specific element in the DOM, right?
[06:18:22] <fosser_josh> seutje: how to do that?
[06:18:24] <Cork> Justin_ZW: to talk native js it is when you add an event listener with addEventListener
[06:18:40] <Cork> Justin_ZW: or if you use any of the jquery functions to add it (on, delegate, click()...)
[06:19:01] <Justin_ZW> I should really learn some javascript. I only know basic stuff.
[06:19:20] <Cork> Justin_ZW: one big difference is
[06:19:34] <Cork> you can have any number of event listeners for a specific event one one single element
[06:19:42] <Cork> but you can ever only have one event attribute
[06:19:50] <Cork> and the two don't interact well
[06:19:54] <seutje> fosser_josh: like $(document.body).on('click', function(e) { if (e.target.id === 'theOneWeAreLookingFor') { doShit(); } });
[06:20:11] <seutje> fosser_josh: but if your using a relatively new jQuery, u can have it do that for you
[06:20:19] <Justin_ZW> What is an event attribute?
[06:20:46] <seutje> like $(document.body).on('click', '#theOneWeAreLookingFor', function(e) { doShit(); }); will do exactly the same
[06:20:56] <seutje> ...essentially
[06:21:01] <Justin_ZW> Is that like onClick, onKeyUp, etc?
[06:21:08] <Cork> <elm onclick=""> for example
[06:21:15] <Cork> or elm.onclick = function() {}
[06:21:20] <Cork> Justin_ZW: yes
[06:21:37] <Cork> onClick is the html 3 version of onclick
[06:21:52] <Justin_ZW> Are they all lowercase, now?
[06:22:02] <Cork> though there isn't really any thing forbidding mixed cases
[06:22:10] <Cork> or all upcase
[06:22:25] <Cork> OnClIcK="" works too
[06:22:30] <Cork> in html that is
[06:22:36] <Cork> when you work with dom it is always onclick=
[06:22:41] <Justin_ZW> Ah.
[06:22:48] <Justin_ZW> I know javascript is case sensitive.
[06:22:58] <Justin_ZW> Which doesn't bother me, since I do Linux systems administration.
[06:23:06] <Justin_ZW> I'm used to case sensitivity.
[06:25:35] <Trudko> Cork well but in case I showed which is really close to  real code  each is significantly faster...
[06:25:51] <Cork> Trudko: sure, but does it matter?
[06:26:16] <Cork> i question the need of looping 4000000 elements in an array
[06:26:35] <Trudko> true
[06:26:45] <Cork> and $.map generates much nicer code then $.each + .push
[06:26:51] <Trudko> yeah that is true
[06:28:28] <axscode> how to listen to an element if was added by a new class name dynamically.
[06:28:54] <Cork> axscode: delegate
[06:29:11] <Cork> $(parent).on('event', 'class')
[06:30:21] <axscode> 'event' should be event? or any event
[06:30:38] <axscode> or string 'event' literally?
[06:30:39] <Cork> axscode: the event you want to listen for
[06:31:05] <Cork> axscode: if you meant an event for when a class was added; there isn't one
[06:31:07] <axscode> Cork, what is the vent, if someone add a class name?
[06:31:32] <axscode> so this suggestion is not for me then?
[06:31:52] <Cork> well that was to listen for events that get a class later
[06:32:01] <Cork> not for the actual adding of the event
[06:32:10] <Cork> *of the class
[06:34:14] <Justin_ZW> The one thing that I have to question is how can JS have anonymous functions? If the function has no name, how can it be called?
[06:34:50] <Justin_ZW> (Onto something else, sorry. I've pretty much worked out where to go from here on the source/via thing)
[06:34:51] <Cork> Justin_ZW: by having variables pointing to them
[06:35:01] <Cork> var name = function() {}; name()
[06:35:02] <shoky> or by calling it immediately
[06:35:08] <shoky> as in an IIFE
[06:35:10] <Cork> (function() {})()
[06:35:13] <jop008> Can I use a file upload using Ajax?
[06:36:21] <Justin_ZW> I like that.
[06:36:34] <Justin_ZW> I don't think you can do that in PHP.
[06:37:04] <Cork> jop008: yes, and... no
[06:37:04] <Cork> depends on what browsers you want to support
[06:37:04] <Cork> Justin_ZW: you can't
[06:37:31] <Cork> jop008: you can't straight upload a file by serializing a file element
[06:37:41] <Cork> you need to fiddle with filereaders
[06:38:08] <Justin_ZW> Heh. Funny, every time I start to get a little cocky, I just come to one of these chatrooms and realize how little I know.
[06:38:20] <Justin_ZW> Anyways, thanks for your help, Cork. I should be good from here out.
[06:38:29] <Cork> yw
[06:51:11] <duchman> hi all
[06:52:19] <duchman> I am trying to get a changing variable into $('#myztable').load('replypub.php?name=$changing variable #myztable'); but it not working........any help pls?
[06:53:11] <BillCriswell> duchman: 'something' + somevariable + 'somethingelse'
[06:53:54] <Haraldson> 'something ' + somevariable + ' somethingelse' *
[06:54:18] <duchman> u mean $('#myztable').load('replypub.php?name= + $changing variable #myztable');
[06:54:23] <BillCriswell> duchman: If $changing is your variable and it's named $changing, do $('#myztable').load('replypub.php?name=' + $changing +' #myztable');
[06:54:32] <BillCriswell> duchman: You're not listening.
[06:54:39] <duchman> ok......
[06:55:08] <faraway> i use jquery 1.10.2 to request and svg with   .get( .... , 'xml')   if i include if this svg includes '<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC  .... >'  IE 7 fails with "parser error invalid XML"  removing the 'doctype'  solves the problem. But I'm wondering if it is possible to find out why IE 7 tells me that the xml is not valid.
[06:55:22] <duchman> ok thanks
[06:55:27] <duchman> will test that now
[06:55:33] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:58:40] <PSR-Z3R0> hmmmm something odd
[06:59:31] <PSR-Z3R0> BillCriswell: thoughts?
[06:59:32] <PSR-Z3R0> http://paste.laravel.com/157c
[07:00:52] <PSR-Z3R0> I was attempting to test and make sure that if I got "yesterday" that if it was the first it would infact show the end of the month for the previous month
[07:01:54] <duchman> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/MXSbBwtS  It is not working still
[07:04:03] <BillCriswell> duchman: What is $sox?
[07:04:48] <duchman> BillCriswell:a container for $_GET php variable
[07:05:12] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: Sure you want getDay() and not getDate()? Think one is for the day of the week and the other is for the actual date.
[07:05:20] <duchman> get a value from a form and inputting to $sox
[07:06:23] <duchman> BillCriswell:a container for $_GET php variable or $changing=  <?php $sox=$_GET["name"];?>; better?
[07:07:42] <BillCriswell> duchman I'm assuming there's errors since you're not quoting the get variable.
[07:09:08] <duchman> BillCriswell:how do I add the $_GET["name"] into $changing?
[07:11:04] <BillCriswell> duchman: Should definitely read up on some PHP basics. You'd need to do like: $changing = "<?php echo $_GET["name"] ?>"; and you shouldn't be using $_GET["name"] without making sure it's cool.
[07:11:49] <duchman> BillCriswell:ok thanks
[07:12:07] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:12:40] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: That help?
[07:18:41] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[07:21:34] <jackp10> I have a modal window that, after clicking the submit button display a "please wait" spinning animate gif. At the same time, a request is sent to download the file. The file takes severla seconds to get ready, but after it is ready, the browser display its default download window, leaving the page with its spinning icon
[07:22:04] <jackp10> I wonder if there is a way to detect when the brower default download window appear, so that I can remove the spinning gif from the page
[07:23:44] <jackp10> wow.. this chat seems pretty dead
[07:26:07] <BillCriswell> Braaiinnss
[07:28:06] <jackp10> I am surprised how silence this chan is, considering the amount of users listed
[07:28:12] <faraway> jackp10: on the client side you can't detect
[07:29:36] <jackp10> faraway: is there, perhaps, another way or method I could achieve the same thing ?
[07:29:43] <faraway> jackp10: but you could pass a download ticket with the request that creates the file, create a second request with the same id to the server
[07:30:54] <faraway> jackp10: and the server "holds" that request until the file is ready and then submits that response so that you can hide the please wait.
[07:32:43] <jackp10> faraway: I see. I'll try this way
[07:32:49] <jackp10> faraway: thanks ! :)
[07:33:42] <faraway> jackp10: or submit the request to create the file to the server, if the file is created respond with the url where you can download it, and then initiate the download. But then you need to take care the you cleanup the created file, something went wrong inbetween.
[07:41:52] <PSR-Z3R0> ah BillCriswell good catch, completely missed that lmapo
[07:41:59] <PSR-Z3R0> I knew that too
[07:42:10] <PSR-Z3R0> perfect :) <33's
[08:16:21] <ddssc> what's the easiest way to sort a list with jquery?
[08:17:56] <jop008> Can I upload a file and catch the result on the same page?
[08:18:14] <jop008> using ajax?
[08:20:39] <BoringName> gdfg
[08:25:03] <BillCriswell> ddssc: There's a plugin called tsort() I believe if you want to sort some elements. If you just have an array you want to sort .sort() is plenty.
[08:25:36] <BillCriswell> ddssc: http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/
[08:25:51] <ddssc> BillCriswell: cheers
[08:26:02] <BillCriswell> I love that show.
[08:41:16] <gnarf> BillCriswell++ that tsort seems a good recommendation, i'll have to remember it
[08:44:07] <gnarf> BillCriswell: though the code is kinda lol comma first waterfall: https://github.com/Sjeiti/TinySort/blob/master/src/jquery.tinysort.js#L157 ;)
[08:45:05] <gnarf> https://github.com/Sjeiti/TinySort/blob/master/src/jquery.tinysort.js#L29 - i'm 99% uglify does this for you...
[08:47:18] <faraway> jop008: you can use the FileAPI for newer browsers to post a file. For older browsers you need to tigger a submit on a form and set the traget of the form to an invisible iframe, so that the result will be loaded in the iframe. If it is not cross domain then you can listen to the onload of the iframe and read e.g. the result out of the iframe or call a finish callback form the the iframe.
[08:47:30] <BillCriswell> Guess they're taking some serious, unnecessary precautions.
[08:47:34] <BillCriswell> gnarf: ^
[08:48:01] <gnarf> BillCriswell: yeah, i looked to see if he had compare-size in his grunt file
[08:48:03] <gnarf> he doesn't
[08:48:19] <gnarf> so like, obviously he THINKS he's saving bytes :)
[08:48:30] <gnarf> but he hasn't watched changes on gzip size
[08:49:34] <shwaiil> Hi!
[08:49:34] <shwaiil> Q: Advice needed. I made my website responsive, for the iphone I had some issues with css fixed, so I'm using iScroll (a plugin that let you scroll content in a given container). When scrolling, I find that by touching (sometimes I trigger) some unwanted elements. What should I do to prevent this from happening ? Thank you!
[08:55:40] <FernandoBasso> I have a div with <label><inputs>. When I .show() the div, the labels show above the input fields. After the effect finishes, the align correctly. Any hints on this?
[08:57:20] <FernandoBasso> s:the:they:
[08:59:18] <faraway> FernandoBasso: my guess is that this is because show/hide enlarges/shrinks in both directions (vertical and horizontal). So wither use slideUp/slideDown or create a container inside the div with the fixed width that contains the label and inputs
[09:00:46] <FernandoBasso> faraway: Slide{Up,Down} is fine. Thanks.
[09:00:52] <FernandoBasso> And you guess is right.
[09:02:56] <jamk> i am using .hover to fadein and fade out different text blocks, i have 4 different icons that should 'trigger' the matching text block.
[09:03:19] <jamk> The thing is, these text-blocks are no children of the icons, how on earth can i target them?
[09:03:58] <jamk> i should probably return an array of the elements containg the text-block class, right?
[09:39:20] <rscarrott> Is anybody familiar with the internals of event delegation in jQuery?
[09:40:16] <BillCriswell> rscarrott: How familiar are we talking?
[09:41:46] <rscarrott> Well I'd like to know a bit more about the selector matching logic against the event.target node
[09:42:15] <rscarrott> in particular when it walks up the DOM tree
[09:44:45] <rscarrott> from around here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L424 onwards
[09:45:34] <BillCriswell> eh, might be a bit out of my league.
[09:48:50] <rscarrott> okay thanks anyway
[09:49:32] <nafta> hello!
[09:50:18] <nafta> ok I'm having a funny problem, I hope you guys can help me out. I'm uploading a jsfiddle
[09:50:29] <PSR-Z3R0> funny is fun ;)
[09:51:28] <nafta> PSR-Z3R0: hehe
[09:51:38] <nafta> fun is this jsfiddle auto url I got -> http://jsfiddle.net/bgSEX/
[09:51:39] <nafta> lol
[09:52:05] <nafta> Velveeta: you around bro?
[09:52:14] <Velveeta> yep
[09:52:17] <nafta> could you take a look at my bgSEX?
[09:52:18] <nafta> haha
[09:53:41] <Velveeta> so, what format is 'data' supposed to be in when it's received?
[09:53:58] <nafta> Velveeta: just a plain echo "data"; from php
[09:54:09] <Velveeta> so it's text?
[09:54:13] <nafta> yup
[09:54:27] <Velveeta> so, for example, it's like "this is a test string" ?
[09:54:43] <nafta> do I have to go with something like .... echo "<div class="returnedStatus">TEXT</div> ?
[09:54:47] <nafta> Velveeta: exactly that
[09:54:59] <Velveeta> then yes, you would have to do something like you just said
[09:55:10] <nafta> ok let me try
[09:55:11] <nafta> thanks
[09:55:16] <Velveeta> the jquery constructor function is gonna expect to see either an object of some kind, or a selector string, or literal html
[09:55:51] <Velveeta> if you pass it some generic text, you're gonna get an empty jquery collection, and then calling .text() on that will result in nothing
[09:56:24] <Velveeta> here's an ideaâ€¦ and i know i've said this beforeâ€¦ why not output json for it to scoop up?
[09:57:06] <nafta> Velveeta: I've been changing some stuff to json output
[09:57:07] <nafta> yes
[09:57:11] <nafta> it seems to be more reliable
[09:57:16] <nafta> on what's returned
[09:57:35] <Velveeta> plus it allows you to add structure to your data
[09:57:44] <Velveeta> so you actually know the purpose of a returned object
[09:58:24] <Velveeta> if you have some generic piece of code calling out to some generic endpoint on the web, and it receives the text "hello world" it doesn't know if that's a success or fail message, or consumable html, or what, unless you build that business logic directly into your callback
[09:59:04] <Velveeta> whereas if you structure your output objects similarly, you can have a generic callback that just said "is there an errormsg property? yes? ok, alert an error message and exitâ€¦ if not, is there some other property? do something different" etc
[09:59:30] <nafta> yes I understnd
[09:59:40] <nafta> I promise I'll keep changing it
[09:59:48] <nafta> thanks again
[10:11:50] <cpsaltis> Hi guys, I'm chris and we just launched the public beta of mist.io a mobile-friendly management and monitoring tool for cloud servers based on jquery. Its open-source (github.com/mistio). Check out our blog (blog.mist.io)!
[10:24:27] <marko-_-> hi guys! Let's say i have 10 ul's in an ol. How would i make it so that it hides the last 5 uls?
[10:25:17] <marko-_-> 	$("li:nth-child(6)").hide(); <-- like this but i want it to do like 6 and till the end
[10:26:46] <Velveeta> marko-_-: $('li:gt(5)').hide()
[10:27:59] <marko-_-> thanks Velveeta
[10:29:27] <Velveeta> marko-_-: no problem :)
[10:36:09] <cjm_> Hi Folks, I'm using jQuery and I am trying to keep a <div> correctly sized.  I have this: $(window).on('resize', (function () {...})).trigger('resize);    This works brilliantly, if I resize the window, but it does not fire the initial resize event.  What am I missing?
[10:37:02] <cjm_> P.S. This is with Drupal, which inserts itself in way that I don't fully understand.
[10:37:33] <marko-_-> Velveeta, what about this one... let's say i have a class .head which i need to clik $(.head).click(function() al well and good and then i want to show the .text class which i do with $(".text").slideToggle("fast") but i have more div's that use .text class and i only want it to use on this one. How can i  do that?
[10:38:41] <rscarrott> $("li:nth-child(6)").nextAll().addBack().hide();
[10:38:57] <BillCriswell> marko-_-: $(this).find('.text')
[10:39:50] <Doddlin> hi all! someone familiar with nivo-slider? Mine is jumping around and getting shown in multiple instances over my page...?
[10:39:58] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, this doesn't work, i'll pastebin it ok?
[10:40:10] <Doddlin> changes position on animation/image-changing
[10:41:46] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/25ATY/2/ here it is i hope you can understand
[10:41:57] <marko-_-> oh my god
[10:41:59] <marko-_-> i am so stupid
[10:42:06] <marko-_-> i actually used .text but this class of course doesn't exist
[10:42:18] <dfletcher> cjm_, https://drupal.org/node/756722 in particular check out "behaviors" - that's a good place to do something on page load in drupal
[10:42:27] <Doddlin> someone on nivp?
[10:42:28] <Doddlin> nivo*
[10:42:30] <marko-_-> ok changed .text to what it should be and it still doesn't work BillCriswell
[10:43:37] <BillCriswell> marko-_-: You're not looking for a child, you're looking for a sibling. Do $(this).next() instead of $(this).find('.whatever')
[10:45:30] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, 		$("div").slideToggle("fast").siblings(".vsebina"); i have it like this and this shows all the divs that have vsebina class, not just the first div
[10:45:59] <BillCriswell> marko-_-: http://jsfiddle.net/25ATY/3/
[10:46:02] <marko-_-> if i change div to this then it fades it out, it doesn't show it
[10:46:20] <BillCriswell> Actually, http://jsfiddle.net/25ATY/5/
[10:46:30] <marko-_-> uh
[10:46:32] <marko-_-> awesome!
[10:46:35] <marko-_-> thanks man
[10:46:53] <marko-_-> why did you take the class out?
[10:48:33] <BillCriswell> It's not necessary.
[10:48:52] <BillCriswell> You would only use the selector if the next child could be something specific.
[10:49:55] <marko-_-> yeah true
[10:50:01] <marko-_-> jquery is so awesome
[10:50:11] <BillCriswell> It's nice fo sho.
[10:51:50] <cjm_> dfletcher, Yeah...  I've read that and I'm defining the described function as part of the "attach" method of the behaviors array.
[10:52:21] <dfletcher> cjm_, well in addition to defining the resize function there, also call it
[10:53:03] <dfletcher> or call a lower level workhorse function that takes better arguments than just an event
[10:53:41] <cjm_> dfletcher, I'm pretty sure that's what I'm doing, or at least that is what I *think* I am doing: $(window).on('resize', (function () {...})).*trigger('resize')*;
[10:54:44] <dfletcher> hmm can you actually trigger a resize event? don't think I ever tried it. but anyway, you can just define your function separately and call it yourself rather than triggering as event
[10:56:54] <jamk> can anyone help me out? been fking this thing up way too much
[10:56:55] <jamk> http://jsfiddle.net/mtQBm/
[10:57:07] <jamk> i have absolutely no clue why it stops working from the third oval..
[10:58:28] <jamk> stops working as in the opacity doesn't change to 1
[10:58:42] <andrew91_> why do you have both document.ready and $(function() {
[10:59:36] <jamk> Good question
[11:00:06] <jamk> That's not causing it though?
[11:00:40] <jamk> Ive been going through the everything a thousand times by now.. i just can't find what's wrong
[11:00:58] <jamk> the inner text, is supposed to show when you hover over the circles
[11:01:19] <RavenHursT> Can someone give me a hand here?  What am I doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/KYbFBgBE
[11:01:32] <RavenHursT> Essentially, I'm injecting elements into #container.. I essentially want to know when #someNewElement is available for me to do something with it.. I thought I could do that with the ready event, but it's not working for some reason..
[11:04:07] <andrew91_> jamk: its an issue of z-index
[11:04:11] <jamk> it is:
[11:04:13] <andrew91_> put a z-index on each of the circles
[11:04:17] <jamk> omg
[11:04:50] <andrew91_> RavenHursT: use .on to attach events to present and future elements
[11:04:57] <Slaxer> Hello everyone, I was curious if anyone has ran into this issue with jquery mobile 1.3.2: SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property '0': object is null or undefined :  jquery.mobile-1.3.2.js, line 4546 character 3
[11:04:59] <andrew91_> delegate is deprecated
[11:05:17] <andrew91_> Slaxer: sounds like its a specific problem not jquery mobile.
[11:05:50] <Slaxer> It error's out using $.mobile.changePage("#main", {allowSamePageTransition: true, pageContainer: $('body')});
[11:06:08] <jamk> andrew91_: are u sure? it looks like the hover event isn't even working. The opacity isn't changing inside the html either
[11:06:24] <Slaxer> andrew91_: Strangely though, it only does this in IE9+
[11:06:27] <jamk> althoug the code is practically the same
[11:06:29] <andrew91_> jamk: http://jsfiddle.net/mtQBm/2/
[11:06:55] <Slaxer> andrew91_: I was just curious if anyone else has ran into this issue, it has been plaguing me for days...
[11:07:03] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/25ATY/5/ how would you make it so that when you click on one the other hides?
[11:07:31] <andrew91_> marko: add a class to them when you click
[11:07:44] <andrew91_> then slidetoggle on each of the classes and remove that class
[11:08:02] <BillCriswell> marko-_-: $('.vsebina').hide()
[11:08:04] <marko-_-> that's the thing i can't manipulate index.html or .css
[11:08:12] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, this hides the one i clicked on too
[11:08:17] <marko-_-> but that one should stay visible
[11:08:42] <BillCriswell> marko-_-: put it before the line that shows the one you want..
[11:09:13] <marko-_-> thanks and sorry for being a pain in the ass
[11:09:20] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:17:49] <adrian_lc> for deleting text only (there are no children nodes), text(" ") vs empty() ?
[11:22:49] <edudx> I have a div, I load this way  " $("div").load("a.php" ..
[11:22:55] <edudx> "a.php"  have a query
[11:23:16] <edudx> So  when I use  x: $(this).val()   is empty..
[11:29:14] <BKD__> I'm trying a menu example but there are different behaviors of the menus
[11:29:19] <BKD__> http://pastebin.com/SvSfAX7W
[11:29:48] <lucenut> I have a form validation problem. I have a set of checkboxes that I have set class="required", but now I need to open a div underneath each checkbox when they check it and enforce required on a set of checkboxes in the div.
[11:30:40] <lucenut> So if they check "Make" it opens a div with checkboxes for Ford, Chevy, Toyota... and then they must check at least one of those.
[11:35:53] <BKD__> sorry
[11:36:02] <BKD__> my first time on channel
[11:36:04] <BKD__> http://jsfiddle.net/62adD/
[11:36:09] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, can you help me out one more time? in .css i have a class .skrij which is a picture of an arrow pointing up.  How would i do it so that when an element is clicked, it will display the picture in the element <p> that uses class .glava
[11:37:14] <BKD__> why if the menu is used on a different place there is a differetn behavior
[11:37:43] <BKD__> is the same menu and the same jquery code
[11:40:19] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, forgot to add the link http://jsfiddle.net/p3t6n/1/
[11:41:03] <PSR-Z3R0> anyone here ever used Morris-chart ?
[11:41:47] <lucenut> I am using jquery.validate.js and making form fields class="required". It enforces on every field, and the offending fields get highlighted except checkboxes.
[11:42:12] <lucenut> Checkboxes just get a "This field is required" next to the first of the offending checkboxes.
[11:42:40] <marko-_-> anyone?
[11:42:41] <lucenut> That make sense?
[11:43:16] <marko-_-> http://jsfiddle.net/p3t6n/1/ 7th line. I want to add the class .skrij to the <p> element which says HTML (the class is a picture of an arrow). Why doesn't this work?
[11:44:34] <adrian_lc> with select2 , any way to change an option after the initialization, so that I can do something like $selects.select2(...).find('[multiple]').setOption(placeholder: "Choose one or more") ??
[11:48:43] <BKD__> There is a button that you can't see at the right side of the links Tutorials and Resources. If you click on it, you will see the behavior
[11:50:35] <marko-_-> BKD__, can you help my problem out? This is the source http://jsfiddle.net/p3t6n/1/ i want there to be the class .skrij which is a picture of an arrow pointed up, when the menu is closed. Hope you know what i mean
[11:51:05] <BKD__> I'm very new on jquery
[11:51:24] <BKD__> It's my first example
[11:51:26] <BKD__> :)
[11:51:30] <BKD__> sorry
[11:51:52] <marko-_-> oh ok
[11:52:52] <marko-_-> i just need to add the class to the <p> when it's clicked but .addClass doesn't work or i'm  doing something wrong
[11:53:01] <MindUser26886> !list
[11:53:21] <MindUser26886> !list
[11:53:43] <PSR-Z3R0> marko-_- add class to which ?
[11:53:50] <PSR-Z3R0> the HTML <p> tag or the paragaph <p> tag?
[11:54:04] <marko-_-> 		<p class="glava">HTML</p>
[11:54:09] <marko-_-> to this
[11:54:16] <PSR-Z3R0> just use $(this) since it's referenced in the trigger
[11:54:24] <marko-_-> i tried
[11:54:26] <marko-_-> wait
[11:54:53] <marko-_-> 		$(this).addClass(".skrij"); did this and there's no picture
[11:54:58] <PSR-Z3R0> also your fiddle didn't include jQuery lol
[11:55:04] <PSR-Z3R0> but yea it's still not working kinda strange
[11:55:20] <marko-_-> really?
[11:55:32] <marko-_-> should i paste it again?
[11:55:51] <PSR-Z3R0> nah I changed that already
[11:55:54] <PSR-Z3R0> still fiddling
[11:55:58] <marko-_-> ok
[11:56:25] <PSR-Z3R0> ohw ait
[11:56:26] <PSR-Z3R0> duh
[11:56:28] <marko-_-> the point is that when a menu is shown, opened or how should i say it the arrow should be down and when it's closed the arrow should be up
[11:56:38] <PSR-Z3R0> fixed ;)
[11:56:44] <marko-_-> paste the link :D
[11:56:46] <PSR-Z3R0> you don't addClass('.class'); it's ALREADY a class
[11:56:52] <PSR-Z3R0> addClass('skirj');
[11:57:06] <marko-_-> lol!
[11:57:08] <marko-_-> thanks man :D
[11:57:15] <PSR-Z3R0> however...
[11:57:22] <PSR-Z3R0> well
[11:57:27] <PSR-Z3R0> your arrow will probably work
[11:57:35] <PSR-Z3R0> just can't see it on fiddle because don't have hte image file :)
[11:57:45] <marko-_-> it's working okay!
[11:57:47] <marko-_-> thanks :)
[11:57:51] <PSR-Z3R0> awesome :)
[11:58:06] <marko-_-> now
[11:58:21] <marko-_-> how should i select that all the other elements have the arrow pointing down?
[11:58:22] <lucenut> Using the built-in jquery form validation class="required", it enforces that the fields are required and highlights the offending fields, except checkboxes. Checkboxes I just get a "This field is required" in black next to the offending checkbox.
[11:58:25] <marko-_-> i mean how to select, just this
[11:58:26] <PSR-Z3R0> well...
[11:58:29] <marko-_-> not asking for the whole result
[11:58:29] <PSR-Z3R0> don't do that
[11:58:40] <PSR-Z3R0> at the beginnign load down arrow on all
[11:58:51] <PSR-Z3R0> then swap up arrow on clicked one
[11:59:06] <PSR-Z3R0> or just push that into a function
[11:59:12] <marko-_-> thanks PSR-Z3R0 again!
[11:59:12] <marko-_-> :F
[11:59:29] <marko-_-> i'm doing jquery and writing bash scripts all day today. I need a break
[11:59:42] <marko-_-> because i can't think logically anymore :D
[11:59:54] <PSR-Z3R0> yea
[12:00:01] <BKD__> what about the behavior of the menus?
[12:00:02] <BKD__> 	http://jsfiddle.net/62adD/
[12:00:05] <PSR-Z3R0> I'm messing with morris-chart atm and it's fucked up
[12:01:25] <lucenut> Does that checkbox highlighting issue ring any bells for anyone?
[12:05:22] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, now the thing is, one menu is open all the time,and i did like you said, i loaded the arrow at the beginning and i want to remove the class on the first element (first menu which is open when you go to the page) 	$(".glava:eq(0)").removeClass("fast"); this does nothing. Why?
[12:05:54] <marko-_-> nevermind... used the wrong class
[12:06:53] <PSR-Z3R0> lol
[12:07:24] <lucenut> PSR, does my problem make sense?
[12:07:40] <lucenut> required formfields all get highlighted except checboxes.
[12:08:21] <PSR-Z3R0> didn't read it lol
[12:08:49] <PSR-Z3R0> what issue ?
[12:08:53] <lucenut> Can I possibly put an extra function in to specifically highlight checkboxes if they are required and left blank?
[12:09:19] <lucenut> Just using the built-in form validation by putting class="required" on formfields.
[12:10:00] <lucenut> It enforces on all fields, puts a message in red at the top of the form in my error div, and highlights all offending fields except checkboxes.
[12:10:18] <PSR-Z3R0> right because checkboxes in themselves can't really be "highlighted"
[12:10:23] <lucenut> Checkboxes just get a silly "This field is required" in black by the first of the checkboxes.
[12:10:37] <lucenut> Can I highlight a div they are in?
[12:10:55] <PSR-Z3R0> sure
[12:11:03] <lucenut> How would I do that?
[12:11:03] <PSR-Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/redler/c3hDK/1/ // see fiddle
[12:11:16] <PSR-Z3R0> this person used a label wrap around
[12:11:34] <ubuntutis> anyone here know basic
[12:11:38] <PSR-Z3R0> basic...
[12:11:45] <PSR-Z3R0> haven't used that in FOREVER :)
[12:11:59] <ubuntutis> is it abanded
[12:12:11] <PSR-Z3R0> fuck if I know... but it's ancient ?
[12:12:11] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, are you here? I managed to somehow make it work. Now when i load the page it works, the arrow's are down on the menu's that are closed and up on the menu that's open. When i click on "show all" the arrows change on all to up and "close" all arrows change to down. Excellent. The only thing is when i click on a different menu, it closes the earlier one and opens the new one, the arrow changes, which is good, but it doesn't change the arrow ba
[12:12:11] <marko-_-> ck down of the previous element. The arrow still stays up. Source: http://jsfiddle.net/zJ3c6/
[12:12:20] <lucenut> So this highlights the label when it's checked?
[12:12:42] <PSR-Z3R0> lucenut yes but you can use the same concept in reverse if you just figure out how they highlighted the label
[12:13:12] <PSR-Z3R0> marko-_- doesn't help if you don't link your images
[12:13:14] <lucenut> I don't understand jquery very well. Not sure how to do something when a required validation comes back.
[12:13:29] <ubuntutis> PSR-Z3R0: so what language do i begin to start programming
[12:13:32] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, the images are on my hard drive
[12:13:38] <marko-_-> how can i link them?
[12:14:04] <PSR-Z3R0> it's ok I just used css to add color: red or blue to the classes
[12:14:05] <PSR-Z3R0> checking now
[12:14:10] <marko-_-> ok thanks
[12:18:08] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, did it
[12:18:14] <marko-_-> 		$(".glava:gt(0)").removeClass("skrij").addClass("pokazi");
[12:18:16] <marko-_-> under .glava click
[12:18:24] <marko-_-> fuck yes
[12:18:47] <marko-_-> no
[12:18:48] <marko-_-> something's wrong
[12:19:04] <lucenut> PSR, can you show me how to fire that highlight thing when the built-in form validation errors?
[12:19:20] <PSR-Z3R0> marienz I'm sure this is wrong...
[12:19:21] <PSR-Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/LvFrm/
[12:19:28] <PSR-Z3R0> marko-_- ^_^
[12:19:38] <Tomashe> i put on click event with if condition checked : $(this,":checked").length>0) { } but its not working... any idea?
[12:20:05] <PSR-Z3R0> I mean it works, but I think there's a MORE elegant solution
[12:20:19] <PSR-Z3R0> Tomashe code?
[12:20:49] <PSR-Z3R0> nvm lol
[12:20:56] <Tomashe> i will ptu it on the jsfillde
[12:21:26] <lucenut> I can't even get that example you posted to work PSR.
[12:21:27] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/uNTb4/
[12:21:43] <Tomashe> i want to check if what i clicked is checked or not
[12:21:47] <PSR-Z3R0> lucenut put your html in there too... and css or I can't really test it
[12:21:59] <marko-_-> thanks PSR-Z3R0
[12:22:00] <PSR-Z3R0> nvm sorry lucenut, Tomashe
[12:22:10] <PSR-Z3R0> Tomashe I can't see it in action without the other elements
[12:22:47] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: You can do like.. if($(this).is(':checked'))
[12:22:53] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:26:37] <wodim> when you do $("element").click(function... it does not work for all new elements added to the DOM after that code is executed. what's the correct way to fix this?
[12:26:48] <PSR-Z3R0> on('click',function()
[12:27:05] <wodim> that would work even for new elements?
[12:27:08] <PSR-Z3R0> should
[12:27:11] <wodim> ouch
[12:27:24] <wodim> even if there's no such $("element") when .on() is called?
[12:27:35] <PSR-Z3R0> I believe so
[12:27:38] <wodim> right thanks
[12:27:43] <PSR-Z3R0> .on() replaced the old method which I can't remember now
[12:27:55] <wodim> what version is this available for?
[12:28:07] <PSR-Z3R0> I think 1.5+ can't remember
[12:28:10] <wodim> ah cool
[12:28:11] <wodim> thanks
[12:28:17] <PSR-Z3R0> ah yea
[12:28:20] <PSR-Z3R0> .on replaced .live
[12:28:32] <PSR-Z3R0> so if .on() isn't working use .live()
[12:29:25] <wodim> hmmm
[12:29:32] <PSR-Z3R0> oh wait... now I remember
[12:29:34] <wodim> it does not work
[12:29:36] <PSR-Z3R0> yes...
[12:29:45] <PSR-Z3R0> .on() still has to be attached to a static element
[12:29:47] <BillCriswell> wodim: You would need to use event delegation for new elements being added. Like... $(document).on('click', '.something-new', function(){ });
[12:29:57] <PSR-Z3R0> yea like that
[12:29:59] <wodim> let's see...
[12:30:14] <PSR-Z3R0> you need to attach it to a static element such as document and then add the item being targetted even if it doesn't exist, so it will listen for it
[12:30:23] <wodim> yes. it works
[12:30:25] <wodim> thank you guys
[12:30:29] <BillCriswell> So no matter when it was added it would run... but it might be a little safter to listen a parent that's not so far up the tree.
[12:30:37] <PSR-Z3R0> yea
[12:30:37] <wodim> ah... i see
[12:30:46] <PSR-Z3R0> I usually listen to the parent item if it's there prior to add
[12:31:00] <wodim> yes. i will do so i guess
[12:31:11] <PSR-Z3R0> just has to be attached to something in the dom
[12:31:57] <PSR-Z3R0> dammit
[12:32:00] <PSR-Z3R0> I hate when I break apache
[12:32:28] <BillCriswell> $(document).on('click', '.foo', doSomething); vs $('.aCloserParent').on('click', '.foo', doSomething)? Pros and cons of each anyone?
[12:33:15] <PSR-Z3R0> only thing I can see is that one is listening to everything on the document rather than finding parent and then checking honestly I don't know jquery enough to give a decent enough answer
[12:33:55] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: My situations exactly.
[12:34:32] <BillCriswell> If you have different .foo's throughout your html that need different listeners I can see using .aCloserParent.
[12:35:33] <PSR-Z3R0> makes sense if you needed differentiation
[12:36:07] <BillCriswell> Even then you can still do $(document).on('click', '.foo a', something);
[12:36:08] <PSR-Z3R0> I've heard attaching to the 'document' was bad... but never knew why
[12:36:41] <PSR-Z3R0> ever used morris-chart BillCriswell?
[12:36:47] <PSR-Z3R0> lol this is killing me and now it's killing my apache too
[12:37:05] <mobile8> i'd like to fetch the date a youtube video was uploaded, does anyone know which function in the YT api does this?
[12:37:27] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: Relax Columbus.
[12:37:47] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, i've added some arrows under the menu (left and right). Now when i click right i want it to close HTML and open CSS and so on (you know, opening menu by menu). Now i have this $(".desna").click(function(){     $(".vsebina").hide();$(".vsebina:eq(1)").slideToggle();}); but instead of :eq(1) it should be like :eq(next .vsebina) know what i mean
[12:38:09] <marko-_-> it works, but only for CSS you know, since it's 1
[12:41:18] <mobile8> how can i best fetch the text in a string between "/embed/mycOde?" <- I need myc0de here
[12:41:22] <mobile8> with jquery, any ideas?
[12:42:35] <BillCriswell> mobile8: '/embed/mycOde'.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
[12:43:02] <mobile8> BillCriswell: thanks
[12:43:02] <marko-_-> 		$(".glava").next(".vsebina").show();
[12:43:08] <marko-_-> this opens up all the menus PSR-Z3R0
[12:43:23] <mobile8> BillCriswell: how do you learn this?
[12:43:36] <BillCriswell> mobile8: Could even use lastIndexOf() and just .slice() on the string.
[12:43:55] <mobile8> BillCriswell: why -1 actually
[12:43:57] <BillCriswell> mobile8: Sitting around in IRC and reading tutorials online mostly.
[12:44:24] <BillCriswell> mobile8: That returns the elements from the end of the array instead of the front
[12:44:39] <mobile8> hmm the problem here is
[12:44:53] <mobile8> I don't need anything after the ?
[12:45:04] <mobile8> '/embed/mycOde?'.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
[12:45:12] <92AAASCVU> is it possible to use .each() on an associative object and force a certain order?
[12:45:14] <mobile8> BillCriswell: i need anything between / and ?
[12:45:18] <marko-_-> BillCriswell, could you maybe look at this code? The last couple of lines where i work with class .desna? I want it so that when i click on it, it closes the previous menu and opens the next one, but this opens up all the menus
[12:45:25] <marko-_-> source: http://jsfiddle.net/FqeTQ/
[12:46:03] <marko-_-> i could do it with eq() but i don't know which menu is gonna be displayed you know
[12:46:23] <marko-_-> is there something like :eq(next one)? :D
[12:46:23] <relipse> how do i sort an object?
[12:46:47] <duch_kazatel> relipse use an array.
[12:47:14] <BillCriswell> mobile8: Is the ? always there?
[12:47:17] <relipse> How do I sort an object with key: {} values. The problem is i'm using .each() to append <option> elements and they are coming in NOT sorted
[12:47:37] <PSR-Z3R0> dammmit to hell lmao
[12:47:57] <BillCriswell> mobile8: You could use slice again and do: '/embed/mycOde?'.split('/').slice(-1)[0].slice(0,-1); could work.. but it's getting a little wild.
[12:47:58] <PSR-Z3R0> I followed the fucking format to a T and it keeps freezing apache... is there anywhere to see js logs once your session window is frozen ?
[12:48:01] <duch_kazatel> relipse you'll have to manually.  objects aren't really meant to be "in order" afaik.  arrays have an order that matters.
[12:48:02] <relipse> i need to sort by a row key value like so: {'mykey':{'lastname':'Smith'},...}
[12:48:20] <relipse> duch_kazatel: are you suggesting i convert it to an array first?
[12:49:05] <duch_kazatel> relipse i'm saying that if order matters, convert to an array or build out logic that renders correctly.
[12:49:17] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, got a chance to look at my code? :D
[12:49:21] <cjm_> Hi Folks, I have a mystery.  I am trying to force a <div> to the appropriate size to consume remaining space after I allow for other <div>s that I know will appear.  I am executing in the context of document.ready.  These <div>s have important dimensions of 0 at this point.  They will display and have non-zero dimensions at some point in the future.  Here's my question: This document is claiming to be ready, so why the zerros?  How can I respond to these values being
[12:49:21] <cjm_>  set to non-zero and what is doing it?
[12:49:23] <mobile8> BillCriswell: i would need anything between /embed/ and the next ?
[12:49:41] <PSR-Z3R0> I could try but I'm not great at this stuff
[12:49:46] <PSR-Z3R0> I can't get my current code to work :/
[12:49:47] <mobile8> this dont work BillCriswell
[12:49:48] <BillCriswell> mobile8: What I have you would work, but if there was no question mark it might cut off something important.
[12:49:51] <relipse> duch_kazatel, maybe i can sort the <option> elements AFTER i insert them
[12:50:00] <duch_kazatel> relipse that's another option.
[12:50:24] <BillCriswell> mobile8: It works. Tried it before I sent it.
[12:50:35] <PSR-Z3R0> ooo idea!
[12:51:05] <duch_kazatel> relipse you'll need to do some sort of check for each name that checks what's rendered all ready and insert before/after wherever it needs to go.
[12:51:21] <BillCriswell> mobile8: http://jsbin.com/ajABiha/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:51:33] <mobile8> BillCriswell: http://www.youtube.com/embed/myCode?&autoplay=0&rel=0&fs=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1
[12:51:38] <mobile8> also on this?
[12:52:27] <BillCriswell> It's not just a ? at the end so no.
[12:52:46] <BillCriswell> 'http://www.youtube.com/embed/myCode?&autoplay=0&rel=0&fs=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1'.split('/').slice(-1)[0].split('?')[0]; can work.
[12:53:03] <marko-_-> PSR-Z3R0, i think i got it it's just my lack of knowing jquery. Try to read what i wrote earlier you'll see that i'm close just don't know how to select the "next" class or how should i put it
[12:53:04] <BillCriswell> Not as effiecient as it could be... but I'm tired.
[12:53:28] <mobile8> BillCriswell: thanks this works np!!
[12:53:36] <mobile8> but im not sure if youtube codes have ? in them
[12:53:41] <mobile8> anyway i guess not
[12:53:44] <marko-_-> http://jsfiddle.net/FqeTQ/ here's the source PSR-Z3R0 the last 5 lines are the problem
[12:55:52] <BillCriswell> mobile8: s.slice( s.lastIndexOf('/') + 1, s.indexOf('?') > -1 ? s.indexOf('?') : s.length + 1 )
[12:55:55] <PSR-Z3R0> ok smart ones.. such as BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/kG4mHKtG
[12:55:58] <BillCriswell> assuming s is the url.
[12:56:12] <PSR-Z3R0> I need that converted to PHP... I've tried to json_decode() it... but it returned NULL
[12:56:18] <BillCriswell> Not smart, just failed more so far!
[12:56:27] <PSR-Z3R0> I need to get a PHP Query into that json response type
[12:56:58] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: I don't know what you mean by php query.
[12:57:13] <PSR-Z3R0> I'm using ajax to pull data from my server and I need to encode a response back that fits THAT format
[12:57:25] <PSR-Z3R0> but I haven't been able to properly format the response
[12:58:57] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: So you want to add an element to that array and sent it back?
[12:59:08] <PSR-Z3R0> no I want to get results from mysql and send it back looking like that
[12:59:56] <PSR-Z3R0> http://paste.laravel.com/15cM
[13:00:20] <BillCriswell> var data = []; data.push({ d: 'foo', b: 'bar' });  ?
[13:00:23] <PSR-Z3R0> but I can't seem to get PHP to encode that way
[13:00:37] <PSR-Z3R0> yes but I am in php going back to jquery
[13:00:57] <mobile8> BillCriswell: thanks again!
[13:01:02] <BillCriswell> mobile8: No problem.
[13:01:18] <mobile8> BillCriswell: btw I've got a result in a var in jquery (xml) and want to get one tag
[13:01:21] <mobile8> how can I best do this?
[13:01:25] <plambwk> chrome is claiming
[13:01:28] <plambwk> $(document).ready(function() {
[13:01:31] <plambwk> is a reference error
[13:02:01] <BillCriswell> Shoudl be able to just select it.
[13:02:28] <mobile8> BillCriswell: its from an ajax result
[13:02:33] <mobile8> i have in function(data) {}
[13:04:15] <PSR-Z3R0> plambwk is jquery loaded before that call ?
[13:04:40] <BillCriswell> mobile8: var $xml  = $(data); $xml.find('foo'); maybe? Don't use XML too much.
[13:05:17] <PSR-Z3R0> hmmm interesting...
[13:05:23] <mobile8> BillCriswell: ok it should basically be the same as HTML right?
[13:05:28] <PSR-Z3R0> $a = array('a'=>array('b','c'),'b'=>array('c','d'));
[13:05:29] <PSR-Z3R0> string '{"a":["b","c"],"b":["c","d"]}' (length=29)
[13:05:39] <PSR-Z3R0> so that's how the php is being encoded :(
[13:05:59] <plambwk> PSR--
[13:06:00] <plambwk> hmm
[13:06:08] <plambwk> its loaded but it might be after
[13:06:10] <mobile8> [object XMLDocument]
[13:06:14] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: Hard time following. var data = {}; data.data = []; data.data.push({"foo":"bar","baz":"boo"}); ?
[13:06:34] <PSR-Z3R0> yes BillCriswell the problem is... the data isn't in jquery it's pull in php and sent back
[13:06:47] <PSR-Z3R0> am I really going to have to format it in jquery for json and then format it again in jquery?
[13:07:10] <PSR-Z3R0> in php* for json
[13:07:17] <BillCriswell> Might be too tired to follow at this point.
[13:07:29] <PSR-Z3R0> when you do ajax, you request information from php right ?
[13:07:33] <BillCriswell> Weird mood for a bagel.
[13:07:37] <PSR-Z3R0> php gets the data and sends back to jquery...
[13:07:49] <PSR-Z3R0> I'm trying to prep the data in php for jquery to simply use as is
[13:08:30] <BillCriswell> If you set the content type as JSON you should be able to just use it right away.
[13:08:55] <PSR-Z3R0> it's returning back json but as you can see the the json isn't being formatted like it's needed
[13:09:20] <plambwk> PSR-Z3R0 nice i dont get the reference error by my jquery still doesnt work ;(
[13:09:25] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: you can use $.parseJSON(string);
[13:09:39] <PSR-Z3R0> http://paste.laravel.com/15cN
[13:09:40] <BillCriswell> but it should be happening automatically, I'd make sur eyou have the right headers set.
[13:10:18] <plambwk> wait nm it does
[13:10:34] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON, $.get('returnsjson.php', function(data){}, 'json');... one of them
[13:13:00] <PSR-Z3R0> AHHH
[13:13:03] <PSR-Z3R0> got it I think :)
[13:13:09] <mobile8> how can I convert this date, 2013-02-01T01:33:13.000Z to 1 FEB 2013
[13:13:12] <mobile8> this format, anyone?
[13:13:25] <PSR-Z3R0> http://paste.laravel.com/15cQ
[13:13:37] <PSR-Z3R0> needed to convert the 2nd arra to an actual object and add it to the array :)
[13:19:40] <PSR-Z3R0> is there anyway to log to console without the weird arrow's for objects and crap
[13:19:43] <PSR-Z3R0> and just get it all laid out
[13:23:08] <BillCriswell> PSR-Z3R0: For that data I'd use console.table
[13:23:15] <PSR-Z3R0> console.table ?
[13:23:17] <BillCriswell> Love that shit, no one seems to use it.
[13:23:19] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[13:23:54] <PSR-Z3R0> oh fucking awesome
[13:24:00] <PSR-Z3R0> interesting
[13:24:38] <PSR-Z3R0> doesn't really help honestly
[13:25:11] <PSR-Z3R0> my data LOOKS correct entirely but when I do something like Morris.Area(data); which should push my data object here with all the options it freezes my browser lol
[13:25:25] <BillCriswell> No idea.
[13:26:05] <PSR-Z3R0> is there anyway to "dump" the console.log so that I can copy / paste it an compare the sample data to my data?
[13:26:11] <PSR-Z3R0> console doesn't let me copy it off
[13:27:10] <PSR-Z3R0> ah ok
[13:27:14] <PSR-Z3R0> I see the problem, it hink
[13:30:23] <PSR-Z3R0> when something is data = [ {this: that}, {this: that}, {this: that} ]
[13:30:27] <PSR-Z3R0> that's just an array of objects right ?
[13:31:15] <NoiseEee> yes
[13:31:52] <PSR-Z3R0> NoiseEee!
[13:32:00] <PSR-Z3R0> you're smart too right ?
[13:34:22] <NoiseEee> as long as its not november, generally
[13:41:34] <lucenut> Can someone show me how to highlight a div around checkboxes when they are class="required"?
[13:41:56] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: If you work in ecommerce.. November is the month where you just feel dumb.
[13:42:04] <lucenut> All I get is a "This field is required." in black next to the top checkbox.
[13:43:02] <BillCriswell> lucenut: $('.required').closest('div').addClass('highlighted') perhaps
[13:43:35] <lucenut> In some function? I am just using the built-in required validation.
[13:44:04] <BillCriswell> Say whatttt
[13:44:25] <BillCriswell> We need some bagels at work.
[13:44:31] <lucenut> Just using the class="required"
[13:44:55] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Ok, and from there you want to... highlight the parent div?
[13:44:58] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: why's that (november).  also, hows the new job
[13:45:11] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: right before Christmas.
[13:45:17] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: ah right
[13:45:29] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: It's pretty cool so far, lots of smart people.
[13:46:21] <NoiseEee> cool
[13:46:25] <lucenut> Well, I have a div around the set of checkboxes with the same name.
[13:46:25] <BillCriswell> It's a much different pace than I'm used to, though.Projects move a lot slower, but they're thought about a lot more, which I like.
[13:46:35] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Right right.
[13:46:54] <lucenut> id="div1"
[13:48:54] <lucenut> $('.required').div1.style.border = '1px solid red;')
[13:49:00] <lucenut> Something like that?
[13:49:26] <lucenut> Would I do it inside a $(document).ready(function(){...?
[13:49:39] <BillCriswell> lucenut: I thought what I said would work just fine.
[13:50:04] <BillCriswell> $('.required').closest('div').css('border', '1px solid red');
[13:50:39] <lucenut> OK, I thought that was psuedo code. :-)
[13:52:05] <BillCriswell> lucenut: I have a hard time with pseudo code.. it looks too much real code for me to try and make it not work... at least in my experience
[13:54:08] <lucenut> Hmm. I am getting a couple of divs highlighted right when I load the page.
[13:54:20] <lucenut> Should I have it inside a $(document).ready(function(){...?
[13:55:27] <BillCriswell> If it's in right before </body> you don't need to, but in the header definitely.
[13:55:56] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Keep in mind .closest('div') could be something more specific like... .closest('.field-container')
[13:56:43] <lucenut> OK. Can I specify this is just for checkbox errors?
[13:57:00] <lucenut> Other field types already work great.
[13:57:46] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Sure, just change the $('.required') to something more specifc like... $(':checkbox.required') I think :checkbox is a jquery selector.
[14:01:01] <lucenut> OK, I have this right before the </body> <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">      $(':checkbox.required').closest('div').css('border', '2px solid red'); </script>
[14:01:32] <lucenut> And it is putting the border around each set of checboxes when the page loads.
[14:02:03] <lucenut> How do I get it to fire just when the form validation fails for them?
[14:04:27] <BillCriswell> lucenut: You'd probably want the form validatior to add the class in that case and just let CSS handle it.
[14:05:14] <lucenut> Yeah, the built-in form validation highlights other field types, just not checkboxes.
[14:05:35] <lucenut> So do I have to write a custom rule or something to do this when a checkbox fails validation?
[14:06:14] <myosotis> how can a checkbox be invalid?
[14:06:25] <lucenut> required validation
[14:06:37] <lucenut> Just using the class="required"
[14:07:01] <say2joe> xhtml? or html5? disabled or required? html5 attribute pattern.
[14:07:12] <BillCriswell> Actually have to run, good luck!
[14:07:28] <lucenut> say2joe, just html
[14:07:53] <say2joe> it should have a value for the name attribute
[14:07:57] <lucenut> Just using the built-in form validation class="required" on all the fields.
[14:08:23] <lucenut> The name for the checkbox?
[14:08:27] <say2joe> oh there's your problemâ€¦ its not passing the validation rules which are probably in some javascript file.
[14:08:30] <lucenut> Yes, they have names.
[14:09:03] <say2joe> but "built-in" isn't appropriateâ€¦ there's no "built-in" class="required" â€¦ that's for use with an external js plugin for form validation, typically.
[14:09:11] <lucenut> The validation rule "works". But all it does is stick a little message "This field is required" in black next to the checkbox.
[14:09:32] <lucenut> Oh yeah, jquery.validate.js
[14:09:42] <say2joe> well, you need a value for the checkbox.
[14:09:49] <lucenut> Other field types all get highlighted red though.
[14:09:52] <say2joe> does it have a value attribute?
[14:10:10] <lucenut> Sure, they have values.
[14:10:17] <lucenut> names and ids
[14:10:58] <say2joe> then that's weird if its checked or unchecked. you should probably point to someone on the web. might be a little verbose for codepen or jsfiddle, i'm guessing, with the form validation script.
[14:11:15] <say2joe> sorry, something not someone
[14:11:15] <lucenut> The validation stops the form from submitting, plays an error in red at the top of the form in the error div and says " There are errors with your submission. They have been hightlighted below.."
[14:12:00] <lucenut> But Bill pointed out that a checkbox can't really be highlighted. It is a group of checkboxes.
[14:12:10] <say2joe> you'll need to step through the code with a debugger. could be a bad validation rule.
[14:12:19] <say2joe> can you copy/paste the html for the checkbox?
[14:12:24] <say2joe> (just the element)
[14:12:32] <lucenut> When the validation fires that there's a problem can't I specify it to do almost anything?
[14:12:56] <lucenut> <input type="Checkbox" name="Products_of_Interest" id="Products_of_Interest_1" value="Food Products" onchange="toggleDiv('div1')" class="required">
[14:13:03] <say2joe> depends on the code! no one can really answer that without the javascript. sorry.
[14:13:24] <say2joe> well, your HTML is fine.
[14:13:48] <lucenut> I thought jquery.validate.js had some "hook" or something that you could talk to when it fires.
[14:13:53] <say2joe> something wrong with how its accessing your checkboxes. i have a feeling, however, that you have multiple checkboxes with the same name (though probably different ids)
[14:14:07] <mehwork> how can i find out which source file assigned event handlers to an element i'm inspecting in chrome devtools?
[14:14:11] <lucenut> Yeah, same name with different ids.
[14:15:03] <say2joe> i think that may be part of your problem (unlike radio buttons, checkboxes typically have different names)
[14:15:19] <say2joe> and jquery.validate.js *may* be tripping on that.
[14:15:42] <say2joe> i would recommend just stepping through code with breakpoints in jquery.validate.js
[14:16:00] <wodim> shut up
[14:16:08] <say2joe> i may be wrong, but seriously doubt the problem it outside the scope of that fileâ€¦ unless you have multiple event handlers for validation.
[14:17:23] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a hover/css element but it's not working on touch in iPhone & iPad, is there a simple fix to replicate the action via touch on these devices?
[14:18:43] <lucenut> I wouldn't know how to step through it.
[14:20:04] <say2joe> i would setup a publicly accessible page with the code or use jsfiddle / codepen
[14:20:21] <say2joe> and then post a url here so people can help.
[14:20:48] <say2joe> there is no hover event on a touch device...
[14:21:04] <say2joe> unless you're using one of those fancy new humid-air-based displays
[14:21:31] <say2joe> then ask tom cruise how he did it in minority report.
[14:21:40] <krambiorix> hi, how can i select all input text boxes and select boxes in one selector?
[14:22:06] <say2joe> $("input[type='text'],select")
[14:31:58] <ffog> how do I use jquery-ui|resize on edges besides bottom and right?
[14:32:27] <ffog> I have something right: 0px and want to resize from the left edge
[14:32:42] <lucenut> OK, I have this in my page. Maybe I can put something in here to customize the checkboxes when they error? http://jsfiddle.net/3HL7R/
[14:33:58] <lucenut> In the if(errors){ condition could I determine if any errors are for checkboxes, then paint the border of the div around them red?
[14:34:30] <lucenut> $(':checkbox.required').closest('div').css('border', '2px solid red');
[14:39:52] <sammych> ugh, I have an svg blur that works in FF in a Fiddle, but it doesn't work when I put it on my actual page
[14:41:21] <sammych> the div that should be blurred is just vanishing. Which I think happens when the SVG element isn't on the page
[14:41:36] <grafi> oO
[14:41:45] <grafi> what is an svg blurr
[14:41:51] <grafi> and why would i need it
[14:41:55] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a hover/css element but it's not working on touch in iPhone & iPad, is there a simple fix to replicate the action via touch on these devices?
[14:42:42] <mehwork> anyone know why jquery-mobile assigns a ton of different event types to an element even though i only explicitly assigned 'tap'?
[15:00:35] <marko-_-> Hello. As you can see here http://jsfiddle.net/9NkgC/1/ i have a menu which hides and shows it's contents depending what you click. Anyway, the last function in the .js file hides the content of the menu when the right arrow is clicked, and now i want it to do so, that the next menu opens, and i don't know i would go for that. If there's something like :eq(next) or something.
[15:02:09] <marko-_-> 		$(".vsebina:eq(1)").show(); <-- this shows the content of the next MENU but it's not good. I can't go eq(2) and eq(3) and so on. There's gotta be a solution for it to go automaticly, right?
[15:05:19] <marko-_-> is there a way in jquery that instead of doins this $(this).show(); you  can do $(notthisbutnext):show();
[15:05:19] <marko-_-> ?
[15:05:23] <marko-_-> doing*
[15:09:06] <dfletcher> marko-_-, http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:09:23] <dfletcher> so, $(this).next().show()
[15:09:42] <marko-_-> thanks but it doesn't work
[15:09:48] <marko-_-> did you look at my code?
[15:10:03] <marko-_-> wait i'll update it now
[15:10:23] <dfletcher> sorry window too short didn't see that :)
[15:10:29] <marko-_-> http://jsfiddle.net/9NkgC/2/ here you go dfletcher
[15:10:54] <marko-_-> can you see what i'm trying to do? I'm trying that when you click on the right arrow, the first menu closes and the next one opens. Last 4-6 lines of code in js
[15:28:40] <dfletcher> marko-_-, http://jsfiddle.net/B8wHz/5/
[15:30:21] <dfletcher> marko-_-, it's not great. but what you had before was calling .hide() on all .vsebina, so that callback happened for all of them. also, what you needed was the next LI, not the next .vsebina.
[15:30:43] <marko-_-> thanks man! I will look over it
[15:31:44] <dfletcher> so my version will open the next one from whatever's already open. even if that's multiples ;)
[15:32:09] <sammych> grafi: firefox needs an svg element to define it's filters
[15:32:12] <dfletcher> oh huh there's code forcing only one to be open
[15:32:26] <marko-_-> the :visible selector selects only the one on which isn't .hide() used?
[15:32:27] <dfletcher> anyway, it fails at the end of the list.
[15:32:31] <dfletcher> yes
[15:32:37] <sammych> other browsers can just do the normal css only definition
[15:32:38] <marko-_-> awesome
[15:33:24] <marko-_-> hm dfletcher it doesn't seem to work
[15:33:31] <marko-_-> now all the MENU's are open
[15:33:35] <marko-_-> when i load the index page
[15:33:52] <marko-_-> nevermind, my fault
[15:33:58] <marko-_-> some syntax problem
[15:34:01] <dfletcher> marko-_-, sorry I messed with the framework of it a bit to get it working in jsfiddle
[15:34:55] <dfletcher> I changed your clickable divs to a because I think it should be like that ;)
[15:34:58] <krambiorix> how can i select the  previous table row?
[15:35:12] <marko-_-> hm how do i make it that when i come to the end, to the PHP menu that it goes to HTML  again
[15:35:28] <dfletcher> marko-_-, good question :P
[15:35:45] <dfletcher> marko-_-, maybe store the result of the :select query - and look at the .length of it
[15:35:57] <dfletcher> if zero, go back to start because there is no "next"
[15:36:59] <dfletcher> marko-_-, var $vsebina = $(this).parent('li').next().find('.vsebina'); if (!$vsebina.length) { ... go back to beginning by opening the first LI .. } else { .. do what's in the code now .. }
[15:37:02] <marko-_-> dfletcher, ok thanks. Btw about next, is there a selector which selects the previous one?
[15:37:20] <marko-_-> oh there is
[15:37:21] <dfletcher> .prev()
[15:37:21] <marko-_-> .prev
[15:38:18] <marko-_-> hm
[15:38:37] <marko-_-> thanks man, really! :)
[15:38:43] <dfletcher> np
[15:42:51] <EGreg> hey guys
[15:42:57] <EGreg> how do I check whether a given jquery array contains a given element
[15:43:08] <EGreg> $.inArray? How is it different from Array.prototype.indexOf?
[15:43:30] <EGreg> or do I use filter() ?
[15:46:13] <EGreg> sex
[15:46:18] <EGreg> I thought that'd get you talking
[15:46:29] <EGreg> hi vinex08
[15:48:20] <noodman> I'm trying to call $.ajax however I'm not getting anything back in the script - if I load the link fed into the $.ajax into a browser it works. I read somewhere that $.ajax doesn't work locally, and only on server - is there a way to get round this?
[15:49:16] <dfletcher> run a local server? ;)
[15:50:53] <gremlyn> does anyone know a way to register an attempted click on a disabled form element?
[15:52:02] <pixelpimp> the same as a non-disabled element
[15:52:30] <gremlyn> pixelpimp, I would have though so, but .on('click', ... isn't working when the checkbox is disabled
[15:54:18] <pixelpimp> oh, i guess it doesn't actually respond to any mouse events. my bad
[15:54:36] <gremlyn> no worries
[15:54:40] <pixelpimp> here's a crazy workaround -_- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3100319/event-on-a-disabled-input
[15:54:45] <pixelpimp> complete with fiddle
[15:55:08] <gremlyn> fancy
[15:55:27] <gremlyn> thanks
[15:56:16] <gremlyn> I'm only really trying to do it for the benefit of the user who might be wondering why they can't click on the disabled checkbox
[15:57:02] <EGreg> why can't they click on it
[15:57:04] <EGreg> lol
[15:57:12] <EGreg> maybe it's part of the shadow dom?
[15:57:20] <xp99work> hey got a question, I'm getting a javascript popup "Houston..." right near the end of a file upload, whats causing that?
[15:57:42] <gremlyn> no, it's part of a UI that checks whether someone has created too many of a specific entity for their account level
[15:58:23] <xp99work> it's not in any of the source code
[15:58:42] <gremlyn> maybe I leave the checkbox clickable until they try, throw up an alert window telling them thy're at their limits and then disabled the checkbox
[15:58:56] <gremlyn> xp99work, gotta be somewhere in the code
[15:59:07] <xp99work> I'm using qq-upload with jquery to do the file uploading
[15:59:14] <xp99work> it happens when the upload is really quick
[15:59:22] <gremlyn> I imagine it's someone's clever way of informing you that you 'have a problem'
[16:03:54] <xp99work> but where is it coming from?
[16:04:31] <noodman> how can change the request url in the .ajax function from file:// to http://?
[16:08:24] <gremlyn> xp99work, far to open ended of a question... could be anywhere in the code you either wrote or are including
[16:09:03] <gremlyn> xp99work, I'm assuming you didn't write that part at least, otherwise you'd hopefully remember where you put it :)
[16:09:11] <gremlyn> start searching the scripts
[16:09:24] <xp99work> did a complete search, it didn't show up anywhere lol
[16:10:08] <gremlyn> including any scripts from external sources?
[16:21:55] <Reedyseth> Zuup guys !!
[16:27:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: hi
[16:28:01] <Reedyseth> Hey guys I have seen that some developers use this operator '-->' in a conditional statement, how do you call this operator ?
[16:29:13] <xp99work> there are no external sources, I checked using chrome and firefox
[16:32:28] <Reedyseth> Hey guys I have seen that some developers use this operator '-->' in a conditional statement, how do you call this operator ?
[16:38:42] <escher> Reedyseth:  decrement followed by greater than. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-name-of-this-operator
[16:46:54] <JFranks> What did I do wrong.. Why won't choice1 toggle on/off? http://jsbin.com/eNUzUpU/3/edit
[16:53:45] <JFranks> It's the Catholics next door I'm afraid.. I'll just go burn them, won't be a moment!
[17:30:35] <Karate> why would you need that?
[17:31:01] <Karate> sorry, wrong window
[17:31:52] <V8Energy> is there a way to make "price" NOT case sensitive? $("*[class*='price']")
[17:44:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: why
[17:44:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> do yu needit not to be case sensitive
[17:44:46] <xp99work> ok figured it out :)
[17:44:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you could sanatize that 'price' part before using in selector
[17:44:57] <xp99work> found the source
[17:45:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> xp99work: great...
[17:45:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just have one question
[17:45:23] <V8Energy> Rohan_Bhangui: well, i am making a bookmarklet that will search through out the page and find all the tags that have a class "price"
[17:45:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you figure out
[17:45:40] <xp99work> it was coming from the system and being caught then it was formatted to be a javascript alert
[17:45:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> class price huh......
[17:45:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry wasnt around when you asked question
[17:45:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy:
[17:46:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: try snatizing the 'rpice' part
[17:46:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> *price
[17:46:17] <V8Energy> snatizing?
[17:46:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> sanatize
[17:46:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning make it in 1 form
[17:46:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> like make everything lower case
[17:47:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> but technically speaking 'PRICE' and 'price'
[17:47:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> are different tags
[17:47:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> 'price' and 'Price'
[17:47:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> are considered the same sometimes
[17:47:27] <V8Energy> Rohan_Bhangui: I can't since I want to use the bookmarklet on different websites
[17:47:46] <V8Energy> I guess I will just use the OR operator
[17:47:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so you do want to normalize it to lowercase
[17:47:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> im guessing
[17:47:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya use or operator
[17:47:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> but here use this trick
[17:48:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> make chars to uppercase
[17:48:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> of original word
[17:48:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then capitalize
[17:48:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> so basically the selectors and generated on the fly
[17:48:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> based on the lowercase class name
[17:49:16] <V8Energy> I don't get it :(
[17:49:35] <xp99work> ok now how to fix it lol
[17:49:41] <xp99work> glad I found this
[17:51:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: think of it this way
[17:52:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> say you have the word price
[17:52:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> 'price'
[17:52:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you want to test 'PRICE' 'Price'
[17:52:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: correct?
[17:52:55] <V8Energy> yeah I want to match PRICE / Price / price
[17:56:21] <Rohan_Bhangui_> V8Energy: im back
[17:56:27] <Rohan_Bhangui_> what you should do is if you have 'price'
[17:56:51] <Rohan_Bhangui_> V8Energy: dynamically generate 'PRICE' and 'Price' so that you can reuse for other words that you might enter
[17:56:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> get it?
[17:59:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: like this but you can put this in a function of some sort http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/ypWTd/298/
[18:05:39] <V8Energy> thank you Rohan_Bhangui :)
[18:09:28] <clime> hey tricky question. If you bind to click event on a form submit button and from the event handler you call event.preventDefault(), will that prevent form submission?
[18:10:37] <shoky> clime: how is it tricky if you can check it in 1 minute?
[18:11:32] <clime> shoky: i have checked, it does in chrome. It is tricky because I would like to know why.
[18:11:49] <clime> shoky: and if it is a behaviour you can rely on.
[18:12:18] <shoky> you should not rely on it, as the form can be submitted in other ways anyway
[18:12:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: no problem
[18:12:29] <shoky> handling the form submit event is usually the best bet
[18:13:23] <clime> shoky: allright
[18:13:34] <shoky> clime: and the reason why is because the default action of a submit button is to submit the form
[18:17:12] <nonamime> hi guys, i am using .html() to add some htmlstring to my page. for what i know is only the particular part i assign is changed. My question is does the particular elemet take the default page css into account ? or it just have to assign before using the jquery.html() to inject the html code.
[18:17:59] <shoky> nonamime: it will be styled by css just like any other element in the DOM
[18:21:51] <clime> shoky: so then I can rely on it, if it's default action. The thing is I would need to change a few pieces of one plugin that binds to click event on a link/button (submit button in my case).
[18:23:50] <clime> shoky: but yeah, it is weird, ill probably change the plugin
[18:30:22] <clime> shoky: the plugin (jquery file upload) binded to a click event on anchor and send ajax POST request based on data attributes of the element. It felt weird that it sends POST requests out of anchor and also I wanted to have no-js fallback so I decided to substitu the anchor for a submit button in a form. So now I am in this situation..
[18:31:25] <sammych> So, I do a bit of HTML building for tables and stuff. It's got a bunch of if statements/tenary ops to put in the right information
[18:32:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> V8Energy: sry for got to mention by doing it my way, you can make it into a plugin.....cause plugins are just generalizations of a jquery script
[18:32:31] <sammych> for another module, I moved to another pattern, by using tagname(htmlString, class)
[18:33:08] <sammych> basically it'll look like tr(td('blah', 'cellClass') + td('meh', 'anotherClass'))
[18:34:30] <sammych> does that pattern fly?
[18:34:31] <nonamime> shoky:  thanks. very helpful.
[18:34:52] <sammych> it's not for every tag, just for the really common ones
[18:34:59] <sammych> that I use to build the HTML
[18:37:51] <pixelpimp> that pattern looks nice nested like that :)
[18:39:54] <shoky> sammych: there are templating languages/DSLs that use similar syntax, so seems fine to me, tho i prefer to use a templating MVC-like lib/framework that helps me build DOM for a component in HTML, not code
[18:40:13] <shoky> (knockout.js in my case)
[18:40:24] <sammych> what do you mean in HTML vs code
[18:40:30] <sammych> td() returns HTML
[18:40:42] <shoky> td() is not HTML
[18:40:45] <shoky> it's javascript
[18:40:52] <sammych> yeah, do you mean no functions
[18:40:54] <sammych> so*
[18:41:05] <shoky> no, i mean html
[18:41:17] <shoky> or a declarative templating language
[18:41:28] <shoky> e.g. stuff like mustache
[18:41:45] <tw2113> mustache rides?
[18:42:00] <sammych> one sec
[18:42:03] <shoky> but if you have a need for it, or like to do it that way, i don't see anything wrong with the example you showed
[18:56:23] <sammych> shoky: thanks for the, validation. Only just started using it in a small module, so I can try something new. I haven't had a deep look into templating libs so I wasn't sure how it would work with piles and piles of conditional portions of HTML
[18:56:55] <sammych> bbl

[18:58:09] <tieTYT> hello, I've got this simple code that does this: $(window).on "unload", ->  root.network.sendAudit(root.core.gameState);  true
[18:58:24] <tieTYT> but when I hit this in the debugger, the window closes after the first line
[18:58:34] <tieTYT> it doesn't seem to make the actual call.  What can cause this?
[19:01:02] <tieTYT> oh that function isn't available... that's why
[19:15:01] <jaypitidi> I have a table and in (some) td elements there will be 2 divs others will have one div. For the td's that have both divs how do I remove just one of them. They are identified by class
[19:19:22] <andrew9183> just count the divs and delete accordingly ?
[19:21:01] <pixelpimp> $('td div').not(':first-child').remove() perhaps
[19:49:14] <sammych> I wish there was a way to make separate tables share common column widths
[19:49:40] <sammych> And I don't mean by using $(window).resize() and setting widths on th's
[19:50:23] <sammych> I've got a document that should be print friendly, but it breaks up the table
[19:55:39] <sammych> you'd mark each table with a common attribute like radio groups do
[19:55:49] <sammych> then the browser does the rest
[19:57:56] <neworder> Hi guys
[19:58:11] <neworder> Is handling failed jQuery AJAX requests important?
[19:58:23] <Velveeta> that's up to you..
[19:58:30] <neworder> hmm
[19:58:59] <neworder> I googled the default timeout for a failed AJAX requests,  seems to be none
[19:59:31] <Velveeta> yeah i don't think there is a default for the client side, server side timeout is dependent on the server settings
[19:59:51] <neworder> Ah I see
[20:22:12] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am using Zurb's jquery joyride (http://goo.gl/JMXFa1) to make a multipage tour through an internal control panel. The problem is it seems to be made only for 1 page but has a postRideFunction which fires a function after the end of the tour (user closes or end of the tip list) I used what one user suggested on github as a fix for multiple pages (http://goo.gl/QZZ6BS) the problem I runH
[20:22:24] <d3m0n> into is setting the cookie. It sets the cookie after the postRideFunction meaning after it closes or finished it sets a cookie to not show the tour again but as the github commenter said if it's the last tip on the page it won't run the function properly.
[20:23:10] <d3m0n> My question is: Is there a way to see if a specific class button was clicked in the function that is run on postRideFunction so I can only run the specifci window.location and unset the cookie?
[20:24:00] <d3m0n> I tried: if ( $(event.target).hasClass(".joyride-next-tip") ) {} but JS error showed up as no event is defined
[20:24:23] <Velveeta> can you put up a pastebin or jsfiddle of the whole function you're trying that in?
[20:24:38] <d3m0n> Sure
[20:25:49] <d3m0n> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/VWKQ5hdu so you can see the postRideCallback fires at the end of the tour or when users closes and fires that function
[20:27:10] <d3m0n> What I am trying to do is only set the cookie/window location if the "Next" button is pressed IE: to continue tour to the next page
[20:27:28] <d3m0n> Because if the user clicks "Skip the tour" on the last tip, it will still fire that function
[20:29:05] <Velveeta> so i'm looking at the guts of that plugin itself, and the way it's written, there's no way to get the event data at the time that postRideCallback function is fired
[20:29:46] <Velveeta> it uses a document.on to bind up its listeners, and when it determines you're at the end, it just invokes its methods.end() function with no information
[20:30:52] <Velveeta> now, you could separately bind up your own listener to trigger in parallel with their listener, and probably do what you want
[20:33:41] <d3m0n> I did run into another github comment that looks like it added info to the method.end() when completed but i wasn't sure how to check that on the postRideCallback: http://goo.gl/oMcfqU
[20:33:41] <d3m0n> Sets a variable completed to true or false
[20:33:42] <Velveeta> right, but that involves editing the plugin directly, which is generally not a good idea if you can figure out how to work around what it's doing natively
[20:33:43] <d3m0n> Yeah defintaley agree but running out of ideas on how I could accomplish this
[20:33:43] <Velveeta> you could just add your own listener to mimic what it does, and use that
[20:33:43] <d3m0n> Maybe something with cookies
[20:34:31] <nafta> Velveeta: man, thank god you are here..
[20:34:34] <Velveeta> http://pastebin.com/Y2XDkbt1
[20:34:41] <Velveeta> that's for d3m0n
[20:34:44] <nafta> I'm trying to understand something..
[20:35:15] <Velveeta> nafta: what is your question, my child <floating>
[20:35:20] <d3m0n> lol
[20:35:29] <d3m0n> Hrmmm okay Velveeta thank you, I'll test it out
[20:36:32] <Velveeta> d3m0n:if that plugin has functionality internally to clean up after itself, it'll strip that listener away with its own since it's in the same event namespace, and other than that, it'll trigger the same as its own internal event listeners
[20:36:52] <Velveeta> the only thing that might be a problem is that it will trigger the instant after its native listener fires, since its own will process first
[20:37:16] <Velveeta> so if it does something that makes the window unavailable for whatever reason, yours might not fire in time
[20:37:24] <nafta> I'm building the question
[20:37:25] <nafta> lol
[20:38:45] <Velveeta> no problemo

[20:39:16] * Velveeta facepalms.
[20:39:30] <pixelpimp> seems like more of a mootools sorta thing
[20:39:30] <Velveeta> i think you're looking for the uhâ€¦.. other.. jquery room.....
[20:39:36] <d3m0n> AOL is next door cuteseh
[20:39:43] <Velveeta> kudos on the mootools jab :D
[20:39:56] <pixelpimp> ;)
[20:40:33] <Velveeta> i had to do some work on a site that was running that a few times, ages agoâ€¦ it was horrible
[20:40:46] <infowolfe> wtf?
[20:41:06] <pixelpimp> shh. just let it happen
[20:41:10] <Velveeta> "hey guysâ€¦ lets take all these different ways of referencing different elements in the dom, and assign them all to different functions, so if you want to select by id, you can use $, but by class, you should use $$" â€¦ "brilliant!"
[20:41:40] <nafta> ok here it is Velveeta -> http://pastebin.com/EmDscaK4  on that link there's a function that gets some json data....and prints it in a fancy way... right here -> http://thegeeksmedia.com/directv-release/app/test2.php you can see how that data is coming... so... feed = feeds.statuses since search returns an array named statuses...as you can see on second link....
[20:42:08] <nafta> now...what I'm trying to do...is get what's on this array -> http://thegeeksmedia.com/directv-release/app/test.php
[20:42:30] <nafta> problem is...it has no name...or I don't know how to fetch it
[20:42:37] <nafta> god I hope I made myself clear
[20:42:38] <nafta> lol
[20:45:02] <Velveeta> i'm not following, actually.. i tried to, though, if that counts :D
[20:45:17] <nafta> haha
[20:45:20] <nafta> I apreciate it
[20:46:13] <nafta> I just want to understand how to get this -> array(1) { [0] => object(stdClass)#5 (22) {
[20:46:24] <nafta> since there's no name on the array O_o
[20:46:48] <Velveeta> well it depends on where that information is coming from
[20:47:00] <Velveeta> i'm assuming your var_dump'ing something to the screen in that script?
[20:47:03] <nafta> on this one...I understand object(stdClass)#5 (2) { ["statuses"]=>
[20:47:10] <nafta> Velveeta: yes
[20:47:18] <nafta> I var_dumped it so you could see both cases
[20:47:40] <Velveeta> right, so what variable are you var_dumping? because that's the name of the array isn't it?
[20:48:30] <nafta> Velveeta: well...what I'm var_dumping is a call to twitter api
[20:48:46] <nafta> $tweets = $connection->get("");
[20:49:16] <Velveeta> so then $tweets is what you're dumping?
[20:49:21] <nafta> yes
[20:51:41] <nafta> for example Velveeta in this case -> http://thegeeksmedia.com/directv-release/app/test2.php   I can do then...after getting the json....functions(feeds) { feeds=feeds.statuses; var screename = feeds[i].user.name; } etc...
[20:51:55] <nafta> because I can see the name of the array..."statuses"
[20:52:26] <Velveeta> well, wouldn't you just foreach ($tweets as $tweet) or something?
[21:31:15] <thinkxl> to count sentences of a string, using string.split('.').length should be enought?
[21:31:23] <thinkxl> enough*?
[21:57:27] <ButtDog> Is is possible to have Jquery within a javascript function?
[21:57:39] <Velveeta> yes?
[21:58:22] <Velveeta> thinkxl: you might need to do split('.').length - 1, or else the empty array element from the last period will throw off your count
[21:59:16] <thinkxl> Velveeta: you are right, also I have to be aware of 2.5 or L.C.C for example
[21:59:24] <thinkxl> needs to be RegEx :/
[21:59:59] <Velveeta> yeah, you might want to split on '. ' (dot-space) instead
[22:00:02] <ButtDog> https://dpaste.de/4u1O
[22:00:12] <ButtDog> Any idea why the jquery within that javascript function isn't firing?
[22:00:24] <Velveeta> then it most likely wouldn't use the last period also, and skip acronyms and decimals (fingers crossed)
[22:01:11] <Velveeta> buttdog: when you say the jquery isn't firing, do you mean the getJSON attempt isn't even happening, or do you mean it isn't alerting data?
[22:01:36] <ButtDog> Velveeta: The getJSON
[22:01:38] <thinkxl> Velveeta '. ' shouldn't work because on end of paragraphs it's '.\n'
[22:02:06] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha, i wasn't thinking about paragraph breaks
[22:02:28] <Velveeta> buttdog: are you calling update_progress() from somewhere?
[22:02:56] <Velveeta> the only things that would prevent that getJSON function from firing would be if you're not calling update_progress, or if you don't have jquery loaded
[22:04:49] <ButtDog> Ya right below it
[22:05:14] <Velveeta> can you paste a little more of that file?
[22:05:32] <ButtDog> https://dpaste.de/cX5Q
[22:05:46] <ButtDog> Should've pasted the whole thing, sorry about that
[22:06:13] <Velveeta> so, looking at that code, it should run just fine
[22:06:21] <Velveeta> is there a page where i can actually see this live?
[22:06:35] <ButtDog> Velveeta, Yes, can I PM you?
[22:06:39] <Velveeta> sure
[22:28:53] <Guest14442> if I setup an event handler and add in some new HTML that will trigger that event, upon triggering the event, the event isn't being triggered
[22:29:41] <Guest14442> so, I have some $('.add').on('click',function(){ ... });, and then when I run something like $('<input type="button" class="add">').after('h1');, clicking the button won't get handled by the event handler I created
[22:32:39] <zAPF> is this the right place to ask jquery related questions? or is the topic jquery core dev?
[22:35:20] <Velveeta> guest14442: that's because the way you're using .on requires your element to be in the document at the time you attach the event listener, if you're adding it after the fact, it won't work
[22:35:30] <Velveeta> zapf: this is the right place
[22:35:49] <Velveeta> guest14442: try $(document).on('click', '.add', function () {})
[22:36:01] <Guest14442> found that Velveeta
[22:36:13] <zAPF> https://gist.github.com/axal90/7350046
[22:36:21] <Guest14442> I ended up finding a solution after googling "event binding for dynamic content"
[22:36:50] <Velveeta> gotcha
[22:37:12] <zAPF> have the problem that if i submit the form it keeps sending requests to the server some kinde of loop...
[22:40:00] <Velveeta> zapf: how many times does that try to submit?
[22:43:38] <zAPF> Velveeta, it was an infinite loop, but managed to fix it, was some problem with a diferent lib binding to the submit action
[22:43:46] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha
[22:43:52] <Velveeta> stupid different libs
[22:43:59] <zAPF> haha :p
[22:44:31] <zAPF> getting this one now thoug Uncaught ReferenceError: textStatus is not defined
[22:45:44] <zAPF> never mind rhat one either
[22:45:44] <Velveeta> yeah, you're referencing it in your .done callback, but not defining it anywhere
[22:45:54] <Velveeta> damn, tie goes to the runner
[22:46:16] <zAPF> thx for taking your time! :)
[22:46:21] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[22:46:27] <Velveeta> i didn't realize it's almost 1am already
[22:46:33] <Velveeta> i gotta be back up at 5:30
[22:46:38] <Velveeta> so on that note, i'm out for the night
[22:46:47] <zAPF> well its 07:30 am here
[22:46:55] <zAPF> still not gone to bed
[22:47:00] <zAPF> :p
[22:47:05] <Velveeta> well then assume i have to be up at noon :D
[22:48:23] <zAPF> I'm allowed to sleep as loong as I want as soon as i have this project ready for testing :p
[22:48:41] <Velveeta> well then get it done :D
[22:50:21] <zAPF> yea, thats the plan ;) but a this stage my eyes have stopped catching obvius things, so I end up googeling more than i code
[22:59:57] <jl2753> Hi, is there a better way to write these two animation statements (like combining them into one line)? http://jsfiddle.net/jl2753/JpvyX/16/  This animates the text color to blue, then fades out the text color back to black
[23:06:12] <lemonsparrow> apart from the simple syntax, is there any other advantage of using coffeescript over javascript ? any advantage in performance specifically ?
[23:10:19] <jl2753> Hi, is there a better way to write these two animation statements (like combining them into one line)? http://jsfiddle.net/jl2753/JpvyX/16/  This animates the text color to blue, then fades out the text color back to black
[23:27:42] <Cork> jl2753: you can chain the delay after the first animate
[23:27:48] <Cork> but other then that no, there isn't
[23:29:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it gives a few functions natively but i would argue there is little point of coffiescript except if you hate the js syntax
[23:29:53] <jl2753> Cork: thanks! just trying to learn the best way to write jquery so its always helpful to have someone read over my code
[23:33:55] <Cork> jl2753: just a side note; but you know you can do that with pure css right?
[23:34:14] <Cork> well except for the scroll animation
[23:35:36] <jl2753> cork: using transition and calling that class with jquery?
[23:35:51] <Cork> jl2753: well no :active and animation
[23:36:17] <Cork> sorry not active
[23:36:21] <Cork> :target
