[00:15:08] <banttu> http://jsfiddle.net/mthgD/ <= line 30 seems to be the condition causing issues. What am I missing?
[00:37:52] <bambanx> guys any good plugin for lazy load images and videos and with effects ... like fades
[00:37:53] <bambanx> ?
[00:37:55] <bambanx> thanks
[00:44:40] <GoSox> how does location.reload() work if the page i'm currently on was created but submitting a form? most browsers these days will ask if you want to resubmit the form if you reload a page like that.
[00:44:54] <GoSox> reload via the reload button, that is.
[00:46:41] <jop008> Any tip on registration a user with verification of the user sending an email to his email box?
[00:47:01] <GoSox> what kind of tip? just… make it
[01:09:32] <motaka2> using $("#content-in").on("submit", 'form', function(e) {...       i understand thet a foorm is submitted does variable "e" contains forms input values?
[01:17:16] <Gazpacho> motaka: no. get them from the document
[01:33:46] <GoSox> any former safari 6 users so fed up with the terrible developer tools in safari 6, that you've switched to doing web dev work in chrome?
[01:39:11] <Vasa> ummm I just use firebug in firefox
[01:39:36] <motaka2> Using var inputs = $('#form :input'); I can capture a forms input but how can i capture the form inputs with action xxx ?
[01:40:13] <GoSox> safari and chrome had dev tools that were great, i liked them better than firefox. then apple fucked them up royally. apple loves to add speedbumps to my workflow
[01:42:22] <GoSox> anyway, an on topic question:
[01:42:52] <motaka2> GoSox: What about my question ?
[01:43:40] <GoSox> on a form a user submits data with, is it reasonable/sane to have jquery run the main text area through a regular expression on every keystroke (instead of on submission) to get more real-time feedback? Or is that too much work, and the kind of things that can hang or just really slow down a browser?
[01:44:08] <GoSox> motaka2: i don't understand what you are asking
[01:45:39] <Vasa> GoSox I think that would delay things down, maybe you should try to ultize web workers or something just to delay a bit the feedback, like 100 ms after the keystroke?
[01:48:00] <GoSox> i'm going to have a list of 'allowed' characters. so i suppose i could just test each keystroke against that list as it's typed, instead of the whole text field. that would be less work. Then test the whole field on submit in case anything got by
[01:48:21] <motaka2> Is this correct?   var inputs = $('form[action='+action+'] :input');
[01:48:46] <GoSox> correct for doing what?
[01:49:08] <motaka2> GoSox: to capture inputs of a form with a given action
[01:49:18] <GoSox> you lost me at "with a given action"
[01:49:43] <GoSox> i capture form elements by giving each a unique ID
[01:49:51] <GoSox> quick and easy
[01:49:58] <Vasa> he probably means to capture a form weather it has a 'get' or a 'post' in its <form action=.... attribute
[01:50:12] <Vasa> yeah an ID seems like a more preferable way to me too
[01:50:19] <Vasa> and if you want multiple forms, just give them the same class
[01:51:08] <Vasa> of course you can get all the $('form..  and then loop through them to find the appropiate action you wish
[01:51:32] <GoSox> i feel like if you need to do that, your probably doing something wrong
[01:52:29] <Vasa> yeah I can't imagine a reason not to use classes and ids , thats what they were made for
[01:52:57] <motaka2> GoSox: vasa Since I always have a search form in my pages including other forms I have to find the submitted one via a unique attr , and since the app is written long time ago with thousands of forms I can't give them IDs m so the only solution is to say please dont submit the form with action ....
[01:53:30] <GoSox> i still don't understand what you're trying to do so i can't help you
[01:53:40] <motaka2> GoSox: I don't care
[01:53:42] <GoSox> the only time form action has ever mattered for me, was on the PHP end
[01:54:05] <GoSox> what a douche
[01:54:08] <GoSox> later loser
[01:54:09] <Vasa> motoka2: can you show us your code
[01:54:11] <motaka2> GoSox: PHP is over - it's time for Node.js
[01:54:16] <Vasa> motoka2 or where is it
[01:54:56] <motaka2> Vasa What I want is to find a form via it's action, is that possible or not ?
[01:55:14] <Vasa> motoka2 I want to help you by taking a look I am not sure yet
[01:55:45] <motaka2> Vasa the form i loaded in page using ajax - lemme see if I can extract the code
[01:57:08] <Vasa> motaka2 you can also link me to that page directly
[01:58:38] <motaka2> Vasa the page is not live:   here is the code for the form  http://pastebin.com/GuMice34
[01:58:52] <Vasa> alright i am taking a look thanks
[02:01:21] <Vasa> motaka2: basically you want, when somebody clicks submit, for it to detect weather the form is get or post right?
[02:02:45] <motaka2> vasa no
[02:03:23] <motaka2> vasa what I want is to know which form on the page is submitted and I cant give thousands of forms IDs
[02:03:37] <motaka2> So I want to find forms by action
[02:03:57] <Vasa> motaka2 you want the form before it submits to go through jquery right
[02:04:05] <Vasa> i am not talking about ids now
[02:04:22] <Vasa> and if its action== something
[02:04:26] <Vasa> then go via jquery
[02:04:34] <Vasa> and if its not that something then dont go via jquery
[02:07:47] <Vasa> motaka2 how about this
[02:08:13] <Vasa> http://jsfiddle.net/ct9sX/1/
[02:09:16] <Vasa>     e.preventDefault(); stops the form from submitting
[02:09:21] <Vasa> its optional
[02:09:45] <GoSox> just found a problem! I have a pretty simple $(#id).click( ); that hides and shows some things. But it doesn't work on IE8 or IE9. Works on IE10 and every other browser.
[02:10:11] <Vasa> ermm there is a mistake you forgot the '  ' between the #id ?
[02:10:34] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/6hV37/
[02:11:31] <Vasa> gosox can i have a full example please this one seems too empty
[02:11:52] <Vasa> gosox you can link me to the page itself
[02:12:48] <GoSox> well i can send you the page, but its kind of complicated so it might be hard to use that, what more do you want on the fiddle, i can just add to that
[02:12:58] <GoSox> here's the link anyway: http://www.menulizard.com/menus/7-deli-works-pizzeria/
[02:13:25] <Vasa> ok can you please point me where to look for the problem
[02:13:39] <Vasa> visually i mean
[02:13:50] <GoSox> well, the thing i'm asking about, you have to be logged in to see. But the big "Browser Menu" at the bottom ALSO doesn't work in IE9 or IE8
[02:14:01] <GoSox> i don't really care about 8 but getting it to work in IE9 would be helpful
[02:14:27] <Vasa> ok browser menu works for firefox
[02:14:33] <Vasa> i will check my ie
[02:14:35] <Vasa> by luck got ie8 right now
[02:14:39] <GoSox> oh well
[02:14:45] <GoSox> the page REALLY doesn't support IE8
[02:14:50] <Vasa> ohh please note
[02:14:51] <Vasa> that
[02:14:54] <Vasa> console log
[02:14:57] <Vasa> makes alot of errors in ie's
[02:15:06] <Vasa> try removing them when you check them next
[02:15:08] <GoSox> how do i even find the console in ie?
[02:15:12] <Vasa> or putting a failsafe on console log
[02:15:33] <Vasa> the console in ie browsers is located in tools->developer tools
[02:15:39] <Vasa> ahh pres F12
[02:16:14] <Vasa> search google for a failsafe for console.log so it doesn't crash browsers
[02:16:28] <GoSox> ok i opened the console in IE9 and suddenly it's working again
[02:16:37] <Vasa> get my point?
[02:16:41] <Vasa> the browser stucks at console.log
[02:16:45] <Vasa> and crashes everything
[02:16:56] <Vasa> a quick search revealed this https://gist.github.com/allentong/2837301
[02:16:59] <Vasa> maybe that will help
[02:17:01] <GoSox> i even rebooted the VM and it still wasn't working
[02:17:49] <Vasa> just remove the alert(msg) line because seems useless
[02:18:39] <GoSox> ok well since it was browser error not website error (shocker!!!) i'm going to eat and go to bed now
[02:18:40] <GoSox> thanks
[02:18:51] <Vasa> alright goodnight
[03:00:55] <platzhirsch> I have a repetitive AJAX calls which stops until a condition inside the result function is met. This works just fine when called from somewhere, but when I use this function inside ANOTHER AJAX result function, it does not work anymore and I can't get my head around this
[03:01:27] <platzhirsch> apparently the request is executed (I get the request on my webserver and it responds with 200), but I don't see that the result function is executed
[03:01:32] <platzhirsch> https://gist.github.com/platzhirsch/ed60a03d51f43f72fb7d am I missing something?
[03:03:46] <sacho> I don't see an obvious reason why that would happen
[03:03:55] <sacho> have you tried placing a breakpoint in check_result?
[03:04:29] <platzhirsch> sacho: I only tried with console.log but let me see
[03:04:48] <sacho> please post the resulting js code of the coffeescript compilation
[03:06:12] <platzhirsch> sacho: sure https://gist.github.com/platzhirsch/ed60a03d51f43f72fb7d this is without the removed code
[03:08:14] <sacho> also add a failure handler to getJSON just to cover all possibilities
[03:09:15] <pallet> Hi all
[03:09:16] <pallet> can someone have a look at http://www.supercomms.co.uk/ and hell me if the header looks cool or rubbish :)
[03:10:35] <platzhirsch> sacho: thanks alot, it actually fails
[03:10:48] <sacho> couldn't parse json?
[03:12:02] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) I have f.e. 6 elements. when I select an element and then click on a button, the element should move on the position of his behind neighbour. How can I use .insertBefore on the neighbour?
[03:12:37] <platzhirsch> sacho: yes, I just return {} it changes then
[03:13:05] <platzhirsch> I thought this is valid JSON
[03:13:28] <sacho> it is
[03:15:28] <sacho> !exec JSON.parse('{}')
[03:16:05] <sacho> ?eval JSON.parse('{}')
[03:16:08] <bot-t> sacho: {}
[03:17:03] <pallet> aynone?
[03:21:49] <platzhirsch> sacho: thanks a lot for looking into this. The problem was that my webserver returned a JSON with a NaN value (which was not quoted), this was the parsing error
[03:22:22] <sacho> mmh
[03:23:03] <platzhirsch> "percent": NaN    }} --> Expecting 'STRING', 'NUMBER', 'NULL', 'TRUE', 'FALSE', '{', '['
[03:53:08] <GoSox> is there a way to make the browser to go to a new page, using a POST request instead of a traditional GET? I'm not talking about loading data using ajax, i mean actually visiting a link. like clicking a link, and having jquery send the browser to that link, just as a POST request?
[03:53:17] <GoSox> i know its weird but it would be handy for me to be able to do this
[03:55:27] <GoSox> in theory i could make every single link i wanted to do this with, part of an actual form that submits on clicking the link
[03:55:37] <GoSox> but i'm hoping for a more elegant solution
[04:04:16] <FrameFever> how can load lazy images?
[04:04:37] <FrameFever> does I have to send a http request like: $.get(lazyImage,...
[04:04:50] <FrameFever> or does I simply change the src attribute in a <img> tag?
[04:06:08] <GoSox> what is a lazy image?
[04:07:19] <FrameFever> I mean lazy loaded images
[04:07:38] <FrameFever> so image loaded after the whole document is already loaded
[04:15:23] <GoSox> if you just want to change an image, then just change the src
[04:35:35] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-05-25_at_1.33.51_PM-20zy1pIo.png what theme must I choose to have this look and feel? (jqMobbile)

[05:32:03] <walidvb> hi guys! i'm trying to use http://the-taylors.org/jquery.kinetic/ on my site, but it only works vertically on safari, and not at all on ff. any clue? http://vbbros.net/aumbry
[05:33:25] <jimi_> Is it possible to modify an existing css class on the fly?
[05:39:43] <walidvb> jimi_: what do you mean?
[05:40:20] <jimi_> walidvb, if class "foo" has a width of 1, i want to change it to 5 o the fly
[05:40:34] <walidvb> on which fly?
[05:40:43] <sonotos> jimi_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/622122/how-can-i-change-the-css-class-rules-using-jquery
[05:40:45] <walidvb> yes you can
[05:40:50] <walidvb> addClass?
[05:40:53] <walidvb> ?addClass
[05:40:53] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[05:40:56] <walidvb> ?css

[05:41:07] <jimi_> i dont want to change it on individual elements
[05:41:17] <jimi_> oh, so i would have to create a new class, destroy it, and apply the new class to the elements
[05:41:30] <sonotos> correct
[05:41:31] <walidvb> $('.oldClass').toggleClass('oldClass newClass')
[05:41:42] <walidvb> or smth
[05:41:47] <jimi_> ty

[06:09:29] <seseisanudo> Hi everybody ..
[06:11:38] <seseisanudo> Is anybody here?
[06:20:06] <Zauberfisch^idle> &topic
[06:20:11] <Zauberfisch^idle> fail
[06:20:41] <seseisanudo> Hi. i´ve a problem with color animation mouseover effect. i use rails 4 and jquery with jquery ui. the mousover effect with color animation works fine till i click on a link and after that it doesn´t work anymore.
[06:23:31] <Zauberfisch^idle> things that I can think of that could cause this
[06:23:53] <Zauberfisch^idle> - click adds a class that overwrites the color
[06:24:37] <seseisanudo> $(".topbar-left .mint").on
[06:24:37] <seseisanudo> 	  mouseover: ->
[06:24:37] <seseisanudo> 	    $(".topbar-left .mint").css({ color: mint })
[06:24:39] <seseisanudo> 	    $(".topbar-left .mint").stop().animate({ color: white }, hover_speed)
[06:24:41] <seseisanudo> 	  mouseout: ->
[06:24:41] <Zauberfisch^idle> - your hover gets unbond somehow
[06:24:43] <seseisanudo> 	    $(".topbar-left .mint").stop().animate({ color: mint }, hover_speed)
[06:25:29] <Zauberfisch^idle> looks fine
[06:25:42] <Zauberfisch^idle> do you have a click event bound as well
[06:26:34] <seseisanudo> i´m not sure how i´ve to do this. the coffescript starts with: $ ->
[06:29:01] <Zauberfisch^idle> I am not that into coffeescript, what do you mean_
[06:29:25] <Zauberfisch^idle> actually, brb, got to reboot this VM
[06:43:54] <Krambiorix> i want to open a dialog in another dialog. This works but i want it to show up physically IN the other dialog... How can i do that? (now the last dialog is opened at the top of the page...)
[07:19:55] <Getty> someone heard anything about freezing computer in the combination windows8+chrome+jquery 1.9.1 ? (or at all about freezing computer in context of jquery)
[07:31:52] <Getty> damn this channel is dead
[07:32:05] <Getty> i miss the old times, where we actually had interaction here.... with only 50 people... all day
[07:32:26] <Getty> really sad that people forced to change the policy of the channel to kill it..... :((( whatever
[07:32:31] <Getty> now those people are not even here anymore
[07:34:30] <Commander_Cody> http://jsfiddle.net/JW64v/ why does this text-mouse-over fail? do i have to toggle a class instead?
[07:35:50] <Woet> Commander_Cody: look at your console, there is an error
[07:36:00] <Woet> and look at the docs: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[07:36:18] <Commander_Cody> Commander_Cody: ok will try find in firebug
[07:36:24] <Getty> there is so many wrong ;)
[07:36:28] <Commander_Cody> should learn proper debugging…
[07:40:11] <Commander_Cody> Woet: ah, there is even exactly the example i want. thakn you
[07:41:32] <abstrusenick> anyone know a good compressor library?
[07:48:48] <Getty> abstrusenick: if you ask for a library you should say the language.....................................................
[07:48:59] <abstrusenick> javascript of course
[07:49:29] <abstrusenick> it seems not many compressor library written in javascript
[07:49:31] <Getty> why of course? compressing makes only sense BEFORE it goes to the browser, and only node.js dudes do that with JS ;)
[07:49:34] <abstrusenick> is it because its slow?
[07:49:38] <Getty> yeah, cause its pointless, only node.js people need it
[07:49:47] <Getty> noone else need it in javascript
[07:49:56] <abstrusenick> want to store compressed json in localstorage
[07:49:56] <Getty> cause we NORMALLY work with languages which are not made for browsers
[07:50:35] <abstrusenick> interestingly with gzip 13kb json becomes 3kb only
[07:50:50] <Getty> yeah....... cause its not .... doing the real compression
[07:50:56] <Getty> normally JS compressor are made to compress JS to JS
[07:51:16] <Getty> cause... yeah guess what, we want to use it as JS.....
[07:51:17] <abstrusenick> js to js?
[07:51:27] <Getty> yeah...... as in that its USABLE after that still
[07:51:38] <Getty> the gzip compressed thing is gzip till you uncompress it again
[07:51:43] <Getty> thats what a normal packer does
[07:51:53] <Getty> in JS compression you want to make the JS smaller for lower loading time
[07:52:30] <abstrusenick> found this
[07:52:30] <abstrusenick> http://nmrugg.github.io/LZMA-JS/demos/advanced_demo.html
[07:52:41] <Getty> but out of the fact that most server now do gzip anyway transparent, it doesnt have any bigger sense
[07:52:53] <Getty> ok i give up ;) you seriously want to waste your time for no effect, have fun :)
[07:54:12] <shoky> you haven't said anything to show he's wasting his time
[07:54:26] <shoky> he wants data compression to store data in localstorage.. not a js minifier
[07:55:19] <Getty> shoky: yeah then he doesnt need a "js compressor" he needs just a packer
[07:55:39] <shoky> he didn't say he needs a js compressor, he said he needs a compressor, in javascript
[07:55:44] <Getty> shoky: he probably searches for a totally different thing
[07:56:10] <Getty> shoky: ok ;)
[08:00:13] <FrameFever> how can I  check if an div is visible to the user?
[08:01:04] <jiko> .is(':visible')
[08:01:43] <FrameFever> jiko: more specific, I want to check if its visible on the screen
[08:01:59] <jiko> compare screen size with position
[08:02:19] <jiko> actually not sure the best way to do that :/
[08:03:04] <jiko> try waypoints: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[08:04:12] <Getty> abstrusenick: just curious, did you ever entered: compressed data localstorage and looked at the first search result? ;)
[08:05:50] <abstrusenick> read abit on stackoverflow

[08:24:31] <FrameFever> ?
[08:34:17] <walidvb> FrameFever: linkedlist
[08:34:45] <walidvb> make an object that has both refs, or add the ref to the object as data

[08:48:41] <enerel> yes
[08:50:47] <enerel> i am not sure but maybe something like this $("#div :input").attr("data")
[08:54:12] <zok> How can I make it so that when a user types in a text input (in a form) it automatically formats it so that it's in a mm/dd/yyyy date format?
[08:54:31] <zok> I know the validate plugin can validate the date, but it doesn't seem to format it
[08:54:38] <zok> At least, i can't find a formatting thing...
[08:57:38] <zok> Ah, masked inputs
[08:57:40] <zok> That's what I want

[10:11:05] <walidvb> hawtin: why not?
[10:12:11] <walidvb> i have trouble using animate({scrollTop: newValue}) on ff, anybody care to take a quicl look? i really can't seem to find whats wrong..?!

[10:23:01] <Fidrox> Hello, I'm having an issue trying to select an HTML element after injecting it with append(). I am guessing it's along the lines of the issue where if the JS is run befor the elements were declared.
[10:28:53] <sacho> example?
[10:29:43] <enerel> sacho can look into my problem
[10:29:48] <walidvb> i'm having an issue using scrollTop() within my body div. works fine on safari and nothing on ff

[10:31:51] <sacho> Fidrox, syntax error.
[10:33:37] <sacho> Please don't ask to ask, and when you ask a question, *provide a test case* - descriptions of code are not useful

[11:41:12] <eager> hi, quick question:
[11:41:42] <eager> something.append($('#header-categories .drop-drop li.active'));
[11:41:59] <eager> or something.append($('#header-categories .drop-drop li.active').clone());
[11:42:22] <eager> why does it put in the html this: [object Object]
[11:42:24] <eager> ?
[11:42:36] <eager> what should I do to see my li there?
[11:54:04] <relipse> $5 to the first person who can figure out my problem: http://ckeditor.com/forums/Support/New-instance-on-the-fly-gives-javascript-error-after-it-is-destroyed-jqueryui-dialog
[11:54:18] <Fidrox> eager: Can you post an example in jsfiddle?
[11:54:40] <eager> one sec, I appear to have solved, pasting how
[11:55:04] <eager> var activeLi = $('#header-categories .drop-drop li.active').clone();
[11:55:04] <eager>         $('#prim-tags-label-active').append('<ul></ul>').html(activeLi);
[11:55:21] <eager> this puts it there allright
[11:56:24] <eager> oh noes, that .html() overwrites everything else there .... :)
[11:56:38] <eager> I'll need to work on it still :)
[11:58:10] <eager> Fidrox: okay, I'll do a jsfiddle, i'm not getting through
[11:58:28] <Fidrox> ok
[12:11:02] <eager> Fidrox: okay, i could isolate my issue in a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/PzzYY/1/
[12:11:47] <eager> so I either would like to keep the label, and have a proper ul (to be semantic) with the active li in it
[12:14:01] <eager> if I change .clone() to .html(), i get only the inside content of the li, but not the whole markup along with its 'active' class; however this is what I'd like, all the li-markup
[12:18:58] <eager> okay, I got it finally: http://jsfiddle.net/PzzYY/3/
[12:19:36] <eager> this helped, I just couldn't copy it properly for like 20 minutes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8377925/jquery-append-string-vs-object-containing-string
[12:19:37] <eager> :D
[12:20:06] <Fidrox> haha, yeah I'm in the same boat. =P
[12:20:08] <eager> finally I spotted what goes where
[12:20:13] <Fidrox> glad you were able to work it out
[12:20:23] <eager> yap :)
[13:11:46] <banister`shop> .
[13:11:51] <banister`shop> anyone here used ace editor?
[13:12:04] <banister`shop> is there way to get it to start an editor on a given DOM element, as opposed to requiring an id?
[13:12:09] <banister`shop> im talking about: ace.edit(id)
[13:12:14] <banister`shop> i want ace.edit(domELement) instead
[13:12:27] <banister`shop> (i tried psasing it a dom element, and it just didnt work :/)
[13:13:32] <banister`shop> im and idiot
[13:13:34] <banister`shop> an idiot
[13:13:35] <banister`shop> never mind :)
[14:53:32] <zissou> let's say you have a list and when you click on a li it takes you somewhere and removes that list. but you still want to know the order of li elements and some id's associated with them. where would you put that data?
[14:54:17] <zissou> for purposes of creating previous and next buttons
[14:54:18] <bomba_> what do you mean with "somewhere" ?
[14:54:27] <bomba_> another page?
[14:54:41] <zissou> click makes a ajax call which replaces html in a wrapper where the list was
[14:55:26] <zissou> i was thinking of putting it in a div with display none
[14:55:32] <bomba_> why not just save the list to a variable ?
[14:55:43] <bomba_> before the ajax call.
[14:56:06] <zissou> when i click next ajax needs to be called again
[14:56:22] <zissou> so i will assign it to the variable again
[14:56:23] <zissou> ?
[14:56:53] <bomba_> yeah, well it's generally true that when you need to remember something, you save it somewhere
[14:57:01] <zissou> can i have global/static vars?
[14:57:06] <Adys> does anyone know how to get form-associated elements working in IE10? (<input form="otherform">) not sure where to ask
[14:58:15] <zissou> can jq access $_session?
[14:58:17] <bomba_> adys i couldn't get it working myself with ie8, so i just used js to position the elements after page load
[14:58:37] <Adys> bomba_: position? within the dom or css hacks?
[14:58:45] <bomba_> dom
[14:59:09] <Adys> does that even work? wouldnt the submit action get all that extra stuff?
[14:59:16] <bomba_> usually you need "attribute" if you have multiple forms, and you want to display one form inside the other one
[14:59:35] <bomba_> "form" attribute*
[14:59:53] <Adys> yeah thats my case
[15:00:09] <Adys> a form with inside an image checkbox selection, and an embedded upload form next to that element
[15:00:15] <bomba_> adys, the submit just got the data of the form it belonged to
[15:00:52] <Adys> bomba_: right but if you move the element in the dom to the other form, you'll get that too, wont you?
[15:01:04] <bomba_> adys, no, it worked for me
[15:01:08] <Adys> ill check
[15:01:25] <bomba_> actually...
[15:01:37] <bomba_> i'm not sure if i had used dom or css as you said
[15:01:56] <Adys> css seems more likely
[15:02:04] <bomba_> yeah, now that you got me thinking .. probably
[15:02:30] <rayfinkle> why does this:  $(".drawerBody").toggle({easing: "linear", "direction": "right"})  result in an animation where in addition to collapsing right, the div appears to move it's lower left corder to the upper right
[15:03:45] <Adys> bomba_: if you used css I'm curious how you did it
[15:06:26] <bomba_> you tried something out and it didn't work?
[15:06:44] <bomba_> i don't want to login to the site from this computer
[15:12:30] <Roundaround> so what do the functions show() and hide() actually do?  is there a way to make it hidden by default so that I may use show() later to display content?
[15:13:21] <Roundaround> I haven't sat down and tested it recently, but I remember I had some issues with that and just settled for calling hide() in the page load code
[15:13:40] <Voting1> the slide effect slides OUT of the viewport... I want to animate movement from one point to another point in the viewport.
[15:13:41] <bomba_> Roundaround, with css properties "display" or "visibility"
[15:14:35] <Roundaround> when you say or, is that a browser dependent condition or something?
[15:15:12] <shoky> Roundaround:  display:none is enough for using .show() later
[15:15:34] <Roundaround> shoky: alright, thanks
[15:16:20] <bomba_> Roundaround, it depends on whether you want the element to already take its space or not
[15:17:41] <Roundaround> bomba_: that would be a no.  it will be a drop-down section, so display:none is the effect I need

[15:50:21] <arthurmaciel> hello!
[15:51:06] <arthurmaciel> I believe it is possible to click on a li element and set the value of and input box with it, but is possible to press Ctrl + click on the element and set the value of another input box?
[15:59:26] <dalnet22> inside a function, I run $.each, and inside the each, if a certain value is found, I want the function to return true. However, when I type return true, it's actually telling the each statement to continue. How can I alert the function to return true inside of $.each?
[16:00:40] <banister`shop> dalnet22: with underscore.js http://underscorejs.org/#find
[16:00:54] <dalnet22> I'll check that out, thanks
[16:07:51] <bomba_> dalnet22, why not the obvious way: inside the $.each loop set a variable in the function's context?
[16:08:55] <dalnet22> bomba_ my goal is to not create unnecessary variables
[16:09:09] <hawtin> can someone tell me what's wrong here -> document.getElementById("repeat_password").addEventListener("blur", repeat_password_check); function repeat_password_check(){ { if (this.elements['password'].val() != this.elements['repeat_password'].val()) { $('#passrpt').css('color', '#000').html('Passwords don't match.'); return false; } else { return true; } } ? :/

[16:47:44] <coldhead> that seems to work http://jsfiddle.net/GgEZc/27/
[16:51:07] <hawtin> it may work on jsfiddle like mine2 but not on local server
[16:51:33] <hawtin> it redirects :/
[16:56:26] <hawtin> weird thou.. in opera it doesnt redirect but when I am trying to submit form with all inputs full it redirects like chrome and firefox does with all inputs left empty ^^
[17:12:08] <arthurmaciel> Is it possible to make doubleclicking not generate a click event?
[17:22:41] <tw2113> chances are it'll still do the event, but you can prevent it from following through
[17:22:59] <tw2113> ?preventDefault
[17:23:01] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:59:59] <joobie> hey guys.. anyone got a sample page of neat jquery text effects that can be done without 3rd party plugis?
[18:11:50] <trinode> anyone here used jquery mobile inside phonegap?
[18:28:08] <madprops> if I run something on a setInterval will it make the main execution hang?
[18:28:24] <madprops> or does it at least feels like some sort of multithreading
[18:29:05] <madprops> i'm talking like updating a list that might take like 3 seconds, I don't want it to interrupt other functions like typing text
[18:37:07] <RohanBhangui> madprops: how are you updating list? what does 'update' entail
[18:38:11] <tff> What is the preferred method these days for JS-driven page browsing, e.g., with the hashbang thing? Presumably jQuery supports a cross-browser way of doing this?
[18:39:01] <tw2113> didn't twitter abandon hashbangs?

[18:39:33] <bot-t> tw2113, Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[18:40:04] <tff> Oh, cool, and this is well supported?
[18:40:35] <tw2113> http://caniuse.com/#feat=history
[18:41:00] <tff> Oh nice
[18:41:07] <tff> WOw
[18:42:30] <tw2113> closest thing i could think of to answer your question
[18:46:39] <madprops> RohanBhangui: it finds all the words in a document, check them against some conditions and save the result in an array.
[18:47:09] <RohanBhangui> madprops: and then outputs this array ?
[18:47:35] <madprops> on demand yes
[18:47:47] <madprops> I have it set to update the list every 60
[18:47:50] <madprops> but the hang is evident
[18:48:23] <madprops> I'm thinking on adding a new word every time something is typed, which would still have to check against the whole list, since the words have to be unique, but I think it might be faster
[18:48:54] <RohanBhangui> hmmmm
[18:49:01] <RohanBhangui> have any jsfiddle example?
[18:49:04] <RohanBhangui> that i can look at
[18:49:28] <RohanBhangui> i was thinking the same thign you were thinking doing it as words are typed but that may be slow
[18:50:46] <madprops> http://jsfiddle.net/e7aa6/
[18:51:20] <madprops> i'm using Ace editor, I'm getting the tokens by an auto updating list it generates
[18:51:38] <madprops> then I get their value, check if they're unique and add them to an array
[18:52:26] <RohanBhangui> what words are you looking for
[18:52:30] <RohanBhangui> just so i get an idea
[18:53:17] <madprops> words that would be relevant in a code editor
[18:54:14] <RohanBhangui> for a particular language
[18:54:17] <RohanBhangui> im guessing
[18:54:19] <RohanBhangui> hmmmm
[18:55:07] <madprops> currently it's quite broad
[18:55:43] <RohanBhangui> the ebst option would be create a premade list of words (which i guess you already have) and as the words are type (only when space is pressed after each word) do you check if the last word typed is apart of the premade list of words and then style however you want (im guessing this is sysntax highlighting
[18:55:45] <RohanBhangui> )
[18:57:28] <madprops> yeah I think I'm going to try that
[18:59:18] <RohanBhangui> also take into consideration when: if(backspace is pressed && space was deleted)
[18:59:43] <madprops> hmmm
[19:19:00] <joobie> guys, what is wrong with this         $("div.slider_txt:eq(" + sliderId + ")").css('margin-' + slider[sliderId].direction, "-1000px").show().animate({'margin-' + slider[sliderId].direction: slider[sliderId].scroll},2000, "easeInOutElastic");
[19:19:22] <joobie> i have defined slider[sliderId].direction as "left" .. and for some reason, it doesnt like that
[19:19:43] <joobie> if i replace that bit with 'margin-left' it works fine.. but it doesnt like the variable being defined in that way
[19:28:33] <shoky> joobie:  var animProps = {}; animProps['margin-' + slider[sliderId].direction] = slider[sliderId].scroll;   ....animate(animProps, 2000, "easeInOutElastic");
[19:28:58] <shoky> joobie: you can't have dynamic keys in an object literal
[19:29:17] <shoky> ?js {'a'+'b': 10}
[19:29:21] <bot-t> shoky: SyntaxError: invalid label
[19:29:35] <shoky> well, not dynamic, but they have to be plain strings

[19:41:30] <bambanx_> guys if i have a lot of images like 100 images for load   in the same div, showing the first image and then show the other in the same div and the other disapear ,  what is the way for do it without crash the browser?  sorry for my bad english
[19:44:11] <joobie> guys, i am using jquery easing to move some text around.. the text hits the end of the div and starts to wrap (the overall height of all the text increases as it goes to multiple lines.. how can i make it just overflow? like not wrap to multiple lines?
[20:16:45] <joobie> guys how do you write a compressed if / else within JS ? if (slider[sliderId].direction == "left") ? $direction = "-" : $direction = "";
[20:16:48] <joobie> is that wrong?
[20:17:48] <tw2113> $direction = ( slider[sliderID].direction == "left" ) ? "-" : "";
[20:17:56] <tw2113> is my guess
[20:19:43] <joobie> no good
[20:37:24] <SeaMonekey> Hello guys. I've made a little website which is an application. One of the parts of the app is to write a captcha (which is loaded from a provider). So everytime somebody enters the website a cookie it's created and a captcha image it's downloaded . Both of them (cookie & captcha file) are deleted after the user clicks the submit option.
[20:38:07] <SeaMonekey> But there are a lot of traffic that does not submit and also bots that loads the page (google, bing, yahoo...etc) and generates captcha downloads from the provider. So I was thinking to put the captcha on a hidden div and show it only when the user click an option
[20:38:24] <SeaMonekey> I used jquery to show the div but the content it's still executed even if the div is hidden
[20:38:38] <SeaMonekey> I mean the captcha download starts anyway
[20:39:29] <SeaMonekey> Is there any way to avoid executing the script until I use #div.show?
[20:43:31] <andkore> is using .append() bad?

[22:09:09] <luigi69> mauricio: what is your problem?
[22:09:18] <mauricio> hi luigi
[22:09:35] <luigi69> hi, you have only one animation there, right?
[22:09:36] <mauricio> when I click on a thumbnail to animate the big image, works fine
[22:09:40] <mauricio> yes
[22:09:53] <mauricio> but the problem is when I click another thumbanil fast, the animation doesn't work anymore
[22:11:04] <luigi69> You would expect to stop the animation before and start a new one?
[22:11:44] <luigi69> mauricio ? Or what would you expect to happen?
[22:12:09] <mauricio> no, to animate and not to animate something else until it has finished
[22:12:34] <luigi69> so if you click 5 thumbnails very fast
[22:12:37] <luigi69> you want them to queue?
[22:15:29] <mauricio> yes, if I click one thumbanil, the animation works, if I click another one before the alpha animatio has finished, teh animation doesn't work anymore
[22:26:03] <luigi69> mauricio
[22:26:15] <luigi69> I don't know what you expect, but i belife adding stop() would help.
[22:26:23] <mauricio> ooo ok, where?
[22:26:29] <luigi69> Check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/7Pmr6/
[22:27:04] <luigi69> *belive
[22:27:22] <luigi69> *believe ... ohh ;(
[22:28:36] <mauricio> thank you !! that will work
[22:49:25] <joobie> guys, i'm using opacity, -ms-filter, filter and setting a background to be opaque. It seems to be affecting all the elements within it (even text sitting within the div).. From what I can see rgba() is what should be used - but is there a CSS2/HTML4 way to achieve this?
[22:59:18] <civilordergone> hey i'm trying to figure out a way to properly trigger an event when a text-box is changed
[22:59:45] <luigi69> civilordergone: text-box?
[22:59:55] <civilordergone> people are suggesting to do a keyup bind on the input box, but that doesn't handle when the
[23:00:05] <civilordergone> user does a mouse click paste
[23:00:16] <luigi69> textarea or input[type=text] maybe?
[23:01:04] <luigi69> civilordergone: try `change` event
[23:02:00] <civilordergone> luigi69, that only gets triggered once the input loses focus.
[23:02:33] <civilordergone> hmm which i guess is good
[23:02:42] <civilordergone> yeah that'll work
[23:02:46] <civilordergone> thanks luigi69 !
[23:03:28] <luigi69> civilordergone: if otherwise, and mouse/keyboard/focus event werent enought you could always start pooling after focus, and stop when blur.
[23:03:43] <luigi69> every x milliseconds
[23:42:38] <Maffelu> is it leagal to use jquery and jqueryui in commercial apps? What are the rules for commercial usage?
[23:59:50] <joobie> guys anyone know a neat effect to sorta spin in a div from say 0 px to its actual height?
