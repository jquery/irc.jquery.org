[01:10:40] <jepense> Hi folks, I'm a bit stuck and would love a push.  I'm trying to set the mime type of a POST request to application/json, but all I see on the jQuery docs is how to set the dataType expected to be returned /from/ the server, not how to set the datatype going /to/ the server.  For example, I've got:  request = {url: someUrl, data: JSON.stringify(someData), type: "POST", dataType: "json"… …} and I call $.ajax(request), which I see sends the info to the serv
[01:10:41] <jepense> but it's not receiving it as application/json.  (I'm using Flask+Python on the server, which is supposed to populate the request.json field inside Flask iff the mime type is application/json, ref here: http://publish.luisrei.com/articles/flaskrest.html).  Does anyone know how to set the mime type going to the server?  I'm quite new to web dev, I'm an AI guy at heart.  :)  Thanks in advance!
[01:11:51] <yurakeshi> Hi, i got some jquery objects stored in vars($obj1, $obj2...) and i'm trying to apply the same effect on them at the sime time. I'm going with $obj1.add($obj2).show(); But does not work and that is clear on JQuery docs. What is the work arround for this? I tried $($ob1, $obj2).show() but it doens't work either".
[01:12:19] <systemfault> jepense: the contentType option?
[01:13:23] <anli_> Is there a tutorial on how to style jquery ui tabs?
[01:13:47] <tw2113> css?
[01:14:48] <yurakeshi> anli_, jquery ui themes are great: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[01:15:12] <systemfault> Lulz.. themeroller.
[01:15:57] <anli_> I am creating my own theme
[01:16:06] <anli_> Sorry for not being clear on that
[01:16:23] <systemfault> jquery ui really sucks for styling.
[01:16:32] <systemfault> Like.. sucking HARD.
[01:16:38] <systemfault> NP-HARD
[01:16:46] <systemfault> (Sorry.. I'm tired)
[01:16:51] <tw2113> how so? can't apply css easily?
[01:17:11] <jepense> systemfault: you are a gentleman and a scholar.  Setting contentType seems to work.  Because I'd like to really understand what's happening, do you have any thoughts on why the jQuery api docs (here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/) wouldn't have contentType mentioned anywhere?
[01:17:19] <systemfault> tw2113: The widget are not separately stylable...
[01:17:27] <Dr-Bombay> jepense: $.ajax takes a contentType setting which applies to the request
[01:17:29] <Dr-Bombay> bah
[01:17:45] <Dr-Bombay> I don't see any systemfault
[01:17:56] <systemfault> jepense: See the documentation about $.ajax
[01:18:19] <systemfault> jepense: That's the "real" documentation… .get/.post/etc.. are just facades
[01:18:29] <Dr-Bombay> right, on ignore
[01:19:02] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: What?
[01:19:07] <systemfault> Anyway..
[01:19:26] <Dr-Bombay> probably for sending UTF-8 sequences in vain
[01:19:27] <anli_> If I understand it, jquery ui tabs does not give me a lot of freedom on how to style tabs
[01:19:44] <jepense> Gotcha, I'll go do some reading on the "real" documentation.  Thanks, systemfault and Dr-Bombay :)
[01:20:27] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: U IGNORE ME?
[01:20:44] <systemfault> I LIEK TO WIRTE NI CAPZ
[01:20:51] <Dr-Bombay> oh goodness there sure are a lot of new "online market" startups
[01:20:56] <Dr-Bombay> reminds me of old times
[01:21:07] <Dr-Bombay> they'll fail too
[01:21:19] <systemfault> Most of them will, indeed.
[01:21:29] <Whirl3d> dwolla ftw
[01:21:48] <systemfault> Never heard of it.
[01:22:04] <Dr-Bombay> saw one today that was "trade your stuff for adbucks"
[01:22:11] <Dr-Bombay> where have i heard that before http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooz.com
[01:22:58] <Whirl3d> https://www.dwolla.com/
[01:23:27] <tw2113> isn't Dwolla out of Iowa?
[01:23:42] <systemfault> On thing that surprised a few weeks ago is instagram… I had never even heard of it.. then **magic**, it's worth a billion… wtf.
[01:23:46] <Dr-Bombay> that's not a market, it's a payment service
[01:23:49] <Dr-Bombay> they might make it
[01:24:15] <Dr-Bombay> at least until paypal builds the same thing
[01:24:16] <Whirl3d> it's brilliant... it could help the new trend in online markets
[01:24:22] <systemfault> I can't wait to pay with my cellphone.
[01:24:26] <anli_> Do jquery ui tabs need to be rectangular?
[01:24:31] <tw2113> if i had a lot of need for it, i'd probably go with Stripe myself
[01:26:58] <Dr-Bombay> jquery ui requires you to specify templates as substitutions rather than callback functions?
[01:27:00] <Dr-Bombay> the fools
[01:28:33] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d: online markets live and die by scale
[01:29:00] <Dr-Bombay> there is no place (over the long term) for a market with a principle of staying small
[01:29:32] <Dr-Bombay> the investors will yank their money

[02:26:03] <mydog2> hey.. trying to figureout the syntax for doing a querySelector where i want to trigger off of the id
[02:26:40] <Dr-Bombay> trigger off it?
[02:27:45] <Dr-Bombay> well, keep trying
[02:29:29] <mydog2> hey Dr-Bombay - yeah.. i want to select a given item that has an id='foo'
[02:30:06] <Dr-Bombay> http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[02:30:30] <mydog2> or better yet, id' like to select the set of items that contain "foo" as in id="foo1" or id="foo2"
[02:31:11] <Dr-Bombay> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[02:31:53] <Dr-Bombay> oh, anything that contains foo
[02:32:15] <Dr-Bombay> i'd kind of suggest looking through the selector page of the documentation rather than me handing you urls
[02:32:34] <Dr-Bombay> I mean, what you're asking about is up top
[02:32:39] <Dr-Bombay> close to the top
[02:33:51] <mydog2> Dr-Bombay,  thanks for the links.. i was actually thinking that the basic javascript querySelector would illustrate how to do this..
[02:34:41] <TheOnlyMerlin> Hello
[02:39:16] <Dr-Bombay> if you must use querySelector, I'd suggest grabbing all elements that have an id attribute, and then filtering for the ones you need
[03:02:05] <venus_> hello, how can i make multiple versions of jquery in a page
[03:12:24] <coldhead> venus_: you really should try not to do that
[03:12:35] <coldhead> but if you are crazy use ?noconflict
[03:12:35] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:12:37] <Dr-Bombay> yeah, that's asking for destruction
[03:13:10] <coldhead> and check jquery.com for stuff on "using other libraries", where in your case the other library is also jQuery >: |
[03:13:43] <mehrdadii> hi guys would any1 be able to help me with this http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-table-reloaded-add-the-shortcode-to-the-page-using-javascript?replies=1
[03:13:52] <Dr-Bombay> it might be useful to explain why you decided you needed multiple versions
[03:17:08] <coldhead> this code is awesome, mehrdadii
[03:17:37] <mehrdadii> thanks but I dont know how to execute the shortcode
[03:18:10] <mehrdadii> if you go to the link there it just shows the string. I want to execute the shortcode to show the table!
[03:18:10] <coldhead> me either, mehrdadii, this is way above my level
[03:18:48] <ironfrank> ciao
[03:19:20] <coldhead> hallo ironfrank
[03:19:39] <ironfrank> list
[03:19:51] <coldhead> mehrdadii: i think your wordpress plugin needs to run on the server
[03:19:58] <coldhead> to turn the [blah blah] into a real table
[03:20:15] <coldhead> and you are only changing it in the browser
[03:20:21] <mehrdadii> I know but I dont know how to do it
[03:20:23] <mehrdadii> :)
[03:20:37] <coldhead> i think it would be very hard to do in pure javascript
[03:20:46] <mehrdadii> I know I have to use do_shortcode in php
[03:20:46] <coldhead> i think it depends on how the plugin works
[03:20:51] <mehrdadii> but never worked
[03:21:13] <coldhead> mehrdadii: can you make a php page that accepts a shortcode in the POST or GET var and it returns the table?
[03:21:43] <coldhead> because if that works then you could use ajax() in jQuery to request that shortcode from the server
[03:21:46] <mehrdadii> we already have in wordpress
[03:22:03] <coldhead> and the server could return the html JUST for that shortcode
[03:22:12] <coldhead> and you could use jQuery to slurp it into the page
[03:22:22] <mehrdadii> http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode this the ref
[03:22:35] <mehrdadii> I am not a jquery expert
[03:22:58] <mehrdadii> all of that code is the fact of reading articles and ofcourse I am C++ programmer
[03:23:00] <mehrdadii> :)
[03:23:10] <coldhead> mehrdadii: can you make a php page that JSUT does this: <?php echo do_shortcode( $_POST['shortcode'] ) ?> ?
[03:23:32] <mehrdadii> I should be able why not
[03:23:41] <mehrdadii> so make a *.php file
[03:23:51] <mehrdadii> and copy and past that there!!!?
[03:23:52] <coldhead> if you get working we can help you with the #jQuery bit
[03:24:04] <coldhead> i hope so, mehrdadii
[03:24:10] <mehrdadii> let me do it now
[03:24:13] <coldhead> or you can try $_GET['shortcode']
[03:24:27] <poppiez> is there any plugin to normalize a feed (RSS and Atom)? jFeed doesn't cut it for me
[03:24:38] <coldhead> then you can test it like this: aids.aidsaidsaids.com/shorty.php?shortcode=[table]
[03:24:49] <mehrdadii> hmmm
[03:24:59] <mehrdadii> Im lost let me make that php file first
[03:25:04] <coldhead> i haven't seen one, poppiez, i usually just do it manually
[03:25:06] <mehrdadii> and upload it to the server
[03:25:17] <coldhead> good luck mehrdadii
[03:25:27] <mehrdadii> coldhead thanks
[03:25:34] <mehrdadii> I will let you know in few min
[03:25:42] <coldhead> i will try to stay awake
[03:27:57] <mehrdadii> ok
[03:27:59] <mehrdadii> done
[03:28:06] <mehrdadii> I made a php file with name of newshortcode.php
[03:28:09] <coldhead> goes it work?
[03:28:13] <coldhead> does*
[03:28:30] <mehrdadii> how should I get it to work
[03:28:32] <mehrdadii> !!!?
[03:28:38] <coldhead> stay calm
[03:28:51] <mehrdadii> ahhh
[03:28:52] <coldhead> what data is your page looking for?
[03:28:53] <mehrdadii> I got it
[03:28:57] <mehrdadii> let me check
[03:28:59] <coldhead> does it want $_POST or $_GET?
[03:29:14] <coldhead> try giving it what it wants and see if it returns the right thing
[03:29:22] <coldhead> eir: noooooooooo you were too beautiful for this world
[03:30:23] <mehrdadii> coldhead: sorry for stupid question but would you tell me the steps
[03:30:34] <mehrdadii> I am not an expert in php either :)
[03:30:35] <coldhead> its not stupid, mehrdadii
[03:30:43] <coldhead> but you are asking the browser to do something for you
[03:30:48] <coldhead> so you need to know what you are asking
[03:30:55] <ravenzz> mehrdadii IDs cannot start with numbers
[03:31:07] <ravenzz> also if you inject a shortcode in js
[03:31:09] <coldhead> ravenzz: WE ARE GETTING TO THAT
[03:31:15] <ravenzz> it won't be replaced by a plugin
[03:31:44] <ravenzz> you need to get it back from an ajax call
[03:31:54] <coldhead> mehrdadii: you should make your code operate on $_GET['shortcode']
[03:31:55] <ravenzz> request*
[03:32:18] <coldhead> and then try yoursite.com/newshortcode.php?shortcode=[table]
[03:32:23] <coldhead> in your browser
[03:32:32] <coldhead> to see if it is sending you the html you need
[03:32:35] <ravenzz> that's not the way you would do that in wp
[03:32:49] <coldhead> ravenzz: i defer to your superior wisdom
[03:32:55] <ravenzz> no sorry
[03:32:58] <coldhead> mehrdadii: do whatever ravenzz tells you
[03:33:06] <coldhead> i trust him with my life
[03:33:09] <ravenzz> I wouldn't be nothing but helpful
[03:33:21] <coldhead> so you WOULD be helpful
[03:33:23] <coldhead> very good
[03:33:29] <coldhead> GOOD DAY, SIRS
[03:33:35] <mehrdadii> calm down guys
[03:33:46] <mehrdadii> thanks coldhead
[03:33:56] <ravenzz> i'd rather send the values throught a post request
[03:34:06] <mehrdadii> ravenzz
[03:34:14] <mehrdadii> how should I do it then
[03:34:15] <ravenzz> and let the plugin creating the table and returning it
[03:34:29] <coldhead> ravenzz: i was going for GET so he could test it in the browser, then we'd school him on ajax and post
[03:35:07] <coldhead> bot-t, noooo
[03:35:36] <mehrdadii> guys I am abit lost here
[03:35:37] <ravenzz> ok, anyway you probably won't be able to use the wp classes in a regular php script
[03:35:38] <mehrdadii> :)
[03:35:45] <ravenzz> it should be a plugin at least
[03:36:33] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: we have a php function which runs the shortcodes which is called do_shortcodes
[03:36:57] <ravenzz> mehrdadii http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins
[03:37:02] <mehrdadii> I think through that we can run the shortcode but I need help to impliment that bit of file
[03:37:30] <ravenzz> so you don't need to query the database and stuffs?
[03:38:21] <mehrdadii> well the table is generated using a plugin
[03:38:30] <mehrdadii> which stores the data on the server
[03:38:33] <mehrdadii> database
[03:40:56] <ravenzz> so that's basically a wp question more than a jquery one :p
[03:41:21] <mehrdadii> lol
[03:41:30] <mehrdadii> well I have posted everywhere
[03:41:35] <mehrdadii> but no answer yet
[03:41:44] <ravenzz> you would probably figure out how to run that plugin in order to get the output back
[03:42:00] <ravenzz> what is the plugin which generates the table?
[03:42:18] <mehrdadii> wp-table reloaded
[03:43:13] <zps> can any one tell me d difference between \B and $ in regular expressions
[03:44:07] <zps> :'( no one??
[03:45:13] * zps slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[03:47:51] <coldhead> zps: \B is any non-word boundary, $ is the absolute very end of the string
[03:48:30] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo aids'.match(/(\Bo/)/)
[03:48:33] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: unterminated parenthetical
[03:48:38] <coldhead> sorry bot-t
[03:48:39] <bot-t> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldazu28sVD1qdqv28o1_500.gif
[03:48:45] <ravenzz> mehrdadii it is an huge amount of code :p anyway i think that the answer is in controllers/controller-frontend.php you should have an instance of WP_Table_Reloaded_Controller_Frontend
[03:49:06] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo aids'.match(/(\Bo/)/)
[03:49:07] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: unterminated parenthetical
[03:49:13] <coldhead> oh for gods sake
[03:49:27] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo aids'.match(/(\Bo)/)
[03:49:28] <bot-t> coldhead: ["o", "o"]
[03:49:45] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo aids'.match(/(o$)/)
[03:49:45] <bot-t> coldhead: null
[03:49:53] <ravenzz> and then try to figure out what method is in charge of creating the table. you can then do a little test calling that method with a static input (shortcode)
[03:50:00] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo aids'.match(/(o\B)/)
[03:50:00] <bot-t> coldhead: ["o", "o"]
[03:50:23] <mehrdadii> hmmm
[03:50:41] <mehrdadii> thanks ravenzz
[03:50:52] <mehrdadii> coldhead thanks for you help as well
[03:51:08] <mehrdadii> I will go and read and see how this plugin works
[03:51:11] <mehrdadii> :)
[03:51:14] <mehrdadii> btw guys
[03:51:28] <mehrdadii> do you know a good source to learn ajax and jquery
[03:53:47] <zps> how did +bot-t responded your code ,coolhead?
[03:54:33] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: do you think this method works: after inserting my shortcode string in my div! then I use jquery .load and reload that div using a .php file (the controller it self)
[04:02:24] <ravenzz> mehrdadii yes that's how it is supposed to 'work'
[04:02:45] <mehrdadii> ravenzz
[04:02:50] <mehrdadii> I went through the code
[04:02:56] <mehrdadii> do you have 5min
[04:03:00] <mehrdadii> to go through it
[04:03:24] <ravenzz> ok
[04:03:31] <mehrdadii> this is the section that controls and insert the tablet
[04:03:34] <mehrdadii> line 153
[04:03:45] <mehrdadii> controller-frontend.php
[04:05:03] <ravenzz> well sorry you won't probaly need to play with that... you should create a plugin, that handle the ajax request and returns the output from do_shortcode()
[04:05:34] <mehrdadii> hmmm
[04:05:58] <mehrdadii> so it is not as simple as I think
[04:07:59] <ravenzz> it should be infact
[04:08:45] <mehrdadii> I am completly lost
[04:08:47] <mehrdadii> :(
[04:08:59] <mehrdadii> Ive been working in this for 2 weeks
[04:09:06] <ravenzz> gh
[04:09:08] <ravenzz> wait
[04:11:43] <Luky> Hi all, i've a little problem with Jquery, and i hope that someone can help me !
[04:12:03] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[04:12:10] <Luky> Yup
[04:13:01] <Luky> I want that, when my input[type=checkbox is hover by the mouse, the input became checked...
[04:13:03] <mehrdadii> ok
[04:13:17] <Luky> does it make sense ?
[04:16:08] <coldhead> Luky: http://jsfiddle.net/Lg23s/ ?
[04:16:42] <Luky> Yes ! Thanks coldhead !
[04:16:49] <Luky> quick and nice !
[04:17:08] <Luky> and for the inverse effect, i need to add .removeAttr ?
[04:20:12] <coldhead> Luky: http://jsfiddle.net/Lg23s/1/
[04:22:14] <mehrdadii> revenzz: are you still arround!
[04:24:06] <Luky> Hum coldhead.. the link you sent me seems to not workin'
[04:24:31] <ravenzz> mehrdadii yep I am, so maybe this can work: backend (a small plugin) http://pastebin.com/9K6hhNFz
[04:24:40] <ravenzz> and this is the front-end http://pastebin.com/dCz64ipn
[04:25:11] <Luky> OOps coldhead My bad, it works ^^

[04:26:05] <ravenzz> yep?
[04:26:07] <mehrdadii> thanks man I will give it a shot
[04:26:13] <ravenzz> yw
[04:26:18] <mehrdadii> so I make that as a plug-in
[04:26:27] <mehrdadii> and see if it works
[04:26:28] <Luky> coldhead: Yep, but i don't know why it's not workin...
[04:26:31] <ravenzz> yes
[04:26:32] <Luky> coldhead: look @

[04:27:17] <mehrdadii> thanks revenzz
[04:29:27] <coldhead> Luky: cssdesk is fucking things up
[04:29:29] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/sJ6Uc/
[04:29:32] <coldhead> works fine there
[04:29:46] <coldhead> there is a syntax error on cssdeck, i don't know what it is
[04:29:50] <coldhead> or care
[04:31:00] <ravenzz> mehrdadii remember that values you are sending could be compromised you probably would have another input field where its value is the md5 of the id and a secret phrase. so you will be able to perform a check in the backend
[04:31:13] <phellarv> Is there a way to re-apply css after dynamic content has changed?
[04:31:15] <Luky> Yeah i know maybe, bad importations of jquery
[04:31:27] <mehrdadii> ravenzz
[04:31:29] <ravenzz> an hidden field ofc
[04:31:30] <mehrdadii> what do you mean
[04:31:34] <coldhead> matter for yourself
[04:31:49] <ravenzz> mehrdadii nvm that is not important now
[04:31:58] <mehrdadii> ok
[04:32:03] <coldhead> better make some coffee, mehrdadii
[04:32:12] <mehrdadii> are you going to be back later on
[04:32:17] <coldhead> phellarv: use classes
[04:32:20] <coldhead> and CSS
[04:32:25] <coldhead> then readd the classes
[04:32:30] <coldhead> re-add*
[04:32:37] <mehrdadii> its really great to see you guys helping us
[04:32:39] <mehrdadii> :)
[04:32:43] <mehrdadii> I really appreciate it
[04:32:58] <coldhead> you'll appreciate it more when it works, mehrdadii !
[04:33:08] <mehrdadii> :)
[04:33:29] <phellarv> coldhead: removeClass and addClass?
[04:34:57] <rgb247> hi to everyone, I have a question
[04:35:03] <coldhead> phellarv: yes :)
[04:35:20] <rgb247> I'm using mouseover function to show a div with things..
[04:35:28] <coldhead> phellarv: it's better to put your style stuff in the CSS, rather than try to keep track of adding/removing each css property in JS
[04:35:42] <rgb247> When I put the mouse over another div inside the first div, the div will be hidding
[04:35:45] <rgb247> why?
[04:35:46] <coldhead> ?csb2
[04:35:46] <bot-t> http://i.imgur.com/Ic3iR.gif
[04:36:22] <coldhead> can you show us your code, rgb247?
[04:36:28] <coldhead> on jsfiddle or a live demo?
[04:36:39] <rgb247> I show you a live demo

[04:38:40] <iman> i am pissed off eclipse, it never understand jquery, syntax coloring, autocompletion and etc

[04:39:05] <rgb247> iman: try to find this out on the eclpise channel
[04:39:32] <iman> rgb247: what editor do you use for jquery ?
[04:39:34] <iman> vi ?
[04:39:50] <rgb247> iman: I'm using Gedit
[04:40:51] <rgb247> it doesn't have autocompletion or a sophisticated syntax coloring
[04:41:27] <rgb247> I use Eclipse when I deal with big projects, not when I need to edit two, three files..
[04:41:50] <iman> rgb247: what I get form http://dpaste.com/747513/ is [object XMLDocument]
[04:42:19] <iman> rgb247: but what i sent as response to client is a string variable
[04:42:29] <iman> a simple string like "TEST TEST TEST"
[04:42:48] <iman> how can I parse this Object and probe it
[04:43:29] <coldhead> rgb247: $("div.fixed-leftside-hovered *").mouseout(function(e){e.stopPropagation()});
[04:43:33] <coldhead> that fixes everything
[04:43:46] <rgb247> thanks you
[04:43:47] <coldhead> ?nopm @ rgb247
[04:43:47] <bot-t> rgb247, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[04:47:31] <rgb247> coldhead: thanks you, can you be a little more explicit please?
[04:48:03] <rgb247> I've replaced with your code and the problem still persist
[04:48:46] <ravenzz> http://9gag.com/gag/4140904
[04:49:20] <coldhead> rgb247: the problem is that anytime there is a mouseout event for a child, all the parents get a mouseover event too
[04:49:33] <coldhead> and they say "oh shit, a mouseout event, what should i do"
[04:49:55] <coldhead> so the parent mouseout handler that hides the div runs AS SOON AS there is a mouseout for ANY of the children
[04:50:16] <coldhead> and my code says "if you are a child and you get a mouseout event, be cool, don't pass it on to your parent"
[04:50:32] <coldhead> so you are ignoring the child mouseouts
[04:50:41] <coldhead> because you are only interested in the parent
[04:50:55] <coldhead> if you want me to be more explicit i will have to take my clothes off and get on webcam
[04:51:19] <rgb247> :) thanks you
[04:52:10] <coldhead> rgb247: you added my code incorrectly
[04:52:18] <coldhead> leave what you had before and add this as a separate bit
[04:53:31] <coldhead> rgb247: if you want to add it to your existing code you can do it this way http://jsfiddle.net/KSt9j/
[04:53:51] <rgb247> thanks you a lot
[04:54:07] <coldhead> you are welcome, good luck rgb247
[04:54:46] <coldhead> you have a .div where you should just have .div
[04:54:56] <coldhead> where you should just have "div"
[04:54:58] <coldhead> no .
[04:55:03] <coldhead> sorry, so many typos
[04:55:09] <coldhead> i have been drinking beer
[04:55:22] <rgb247> coldhead: not problem, thanks you:)
[04:55:32] <rgb247> it seems that there are a little problem with "target.is"
[04:55:36] <coldhead> here is the corrected one http://jsfiddle.net/KSt9j/1/
[04:55:49] <coldhead> more bugs
[04:55:55] <coldhead> here http://jsfiddle.net/KSt9j/2/
[04:56:08] <coldhead> i forgot to wrap e.target in $()
[04:56:17] <coldhead> so i could use jquery's .is()
[04:56:31] <coldhead> now it is good and perfect forever
[04:56:50] <rgb247> same problem with e.target.is
[04:56:55] <rgb247> error: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'is'
[04:57:03] <coldhead> DID YOU SEE MY VERSION 2
[04:57:07] <coldhead> IT IS FIXED
[04:57:16] <coldhead> PAY MORE ATTENTION
[04:57:20] <coldhead> $(e.target)
[04:57:34] <rgb247> yes.. I'm sorry
[04:57:49] <coldhead> not it doesn't seem to close at all
[04:57:51] <rgb247> I saw that you gave me another link but I don't know why the copy/pasting it to browser won't work
[04:57:51] <venus_> hello, can anyone tell me why the scroll inside the tabbed panels are not working http://jsfiddle.net/H7fM2/
[04:57:52] <coldhead> but this is progress!
[04:58:44] <rgb247> coldhead: I see that there are some times when the menu won't close..
[04:59:04] <rgb247> when the mouse is out of the main div
[04:59:35] <coldhead> rgb247: maybe try http://jsfiddle.net/KSt9j/3/
[04:59:42] <devilsbackyard> i am having some problems with getting url query strings. is there any jquery function to do this?
[04:59:48] <coldhead> or ask someone else, it's my first day using jQuery
[05:00:13] <coldhead> i don't think so, devilsbackyard, but there is lots of short code on google to do it for you
[05:00:44] <coldhead> devilsbackyard: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1131630/javascript-jquery-param-inverse-function
[05:01:52] <devilsbackyard> thanks coldhead, but what does "/\+/g" do?
[05:02:12] <rgb247> thanks you coldhead for help, the problem is still persist, I'll try to find someone else which can help me
[05:02:19] <devilsbackyard> it is basically "/something here/g" which I don't understand
[05:03:09] <coldhead> devilsbackyard: that's a regular expression
[05:03:16] <coldhead> the g makes it global
[05:03:36] <coldhead> ?eval 'something here'.match(/something here/g)
[05:03:37] <bot-t> coldhead: ["something here"]
[05:03:43] <coldhead> ?eval 'not here'.match(/something here/g)

[05:09:40] <zim> Hi all. having problems with AJAX loaded content. example here. http://jsfiddle.net/EM72z/ is there any way to get jquery to bind to all new content?
[05:10:03] <coldhead> ?on @ zim
[05:10:03] <bot-t> zim, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:10:11] <coldhead> ?live @ zim
[05:10:11] <bot-t> zim, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[05:10:16] <coldhead> if you find that a bit bewildering
[05:10:33] <Gorkyman> hey guys... how do you solve issues when html is inserted dynamically... I want to bind functions to every new html element I insert... do you do that with inline js or is there a better way?

[05:13:54] <zim> FF 12
[05:13:55] <venus_> zim, yes but click on other tabs :)
[05:15:26] * venus_ ..
[05:15:37] <youngin> coldhead: thought u were a chick?
[05:15:52] <zim> I see they are erratic. I would say  that the scroll is zindexed higher that all the tabs so the last tabs scroll is still there

[05:16:17] <coldhead> i can be whatever you want, baby
[05:16:20] <coldhead> i'm not fussy
[05:17:03] <venus_> zim: but that tabbed content is set to display: none;
[05:18:13] <zim> yes but the scroll is not hidden by the tab position: absolute;

[05:30:09] <sanam> there is some links to be clicked to open a lightbox and to edit or sent something to another php file,
[05:30:18] <sanam> how can I do this with jquery ajax?
[05:32:08] <Hopsy> ?help
[05:32:08] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[05:38:55] <sanam> I have a link <a href="#" value="2">Edit</a>
[05:39:19] <sanam> and I need to get the value of this link to send it to another php file for process
[05:39:36] <sanam> and the result of the php file should be displayed back to me on the page
[05:39:44] <sanam> how can I do this with jQuery?
[05:43:46] <vlad27aug> you can use $('a').attr('value') to get the value of the "value" attribute...but you should use a more specific selector...like having the anchor inside a container with a class or an id
[05:44:26] <vlad27aug> and then checkout the jQuery.post for the second part
[05:44:40] <vlad27aug> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:49:45] <sanam> Yes, you are right, I did the same, but it didn't work,
[05:50:02] <sanam> could you please give me some links to post my code there and please have a look
[05:50:11] <sanam> these are couple of lines
[06:23:51] <sanam> does any one can help me what is wrong with my code here: http://pastebin.com/isVwgw7t
[06:48:31] <zim> Hi all still having trouble with .on example here. http://jsfiddle.net/EM72z/1/
[06:49:10] <zim> http://jsfiddle.net/EM72z/2/
[06:49:17] <zim> look at v2
[06:55:05] <zim> did the plague just hit #jquery very quiet in here
[06:57:32] <skylamer`> whats the problem ZIM?
[06:58:19] <skylamer`> on isnt appliend on the dynamic added contents may be
[06:58:26] <zim> I need to bind loaded js to new content and was pointed at .on but can't seem to make it work
[06:58:50] <skylamer`> http://jsfiddle.net/EM72z/3/
[06:58:53] <skylamer`> :)
[06:59:39] <zim> Ha I see !!! ty
[07:00:42] <zim> skylamer`: why don't all jquery .* act like .live ?
[07:01:36] <skylamer`> idk go read some on the jquery docz site :)
[07:02:09] <zim> its a constant battle I have with ajax loaded content
[07:13:10] <dabear_> zim: because the underlayinh API is not live, so neither is jquery
[07:13:58] <zim> dabear_: will this ever change?
[07:14:10] <dabear_> zim: nope and it shouldn't
[07:14:19] <zim> why?
[07:14:45] <dabear_> zim: I do not understand your question
[07:15:23] <dabear_> are you seriously suggesting that an API used by millions of developers should be changed to fit your usage better?
[07:16:02] <zim> There must be a simple way to apply all the current rules/script/... to new content
[07:16:22] <dabear_> .live or livequery
[07:17:18] <zim> but from my understanding .live only works with a few function like click
[07:17:43] <zim> can you .live anything?
[07:18:32] <dabear_> yes*
[07:18:42] <dabear_> *with a few exceptions
[07:18:45] <novns> what is the right way to select options by html attribute?  $('#input option[html="value"]') is not working
[07:19:17] <dabear_> novns: gonna be slow, but see ?:contains
[07:19:19] <bot-t> novns, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:19:56] <novns> dabear_, :contains works but searching for substrings, and this is no good
[07:20:23] <novns> I need to test whole html attribute
[07:20:42] <dabear_> novns: then select the option, then do .filter( function(){ return this.innerHTML == "value";})
[07:20:52] <dabear_> novns: html is not an attribute
[07:20:53] <novns> dabear_, ok, thanks
[07:26:14] <PhonicUK> is it possible to change an elements parent without removing it/adding it back to the DOM?
[07:26:16] <zim> dabear_: what are the pro's/cons of .on vs .live ?
[07:26:33] <dabear_> zim: .on is faster always
[07:26:42] <dabear_> the .live api is easier to read
[07:26:46] <vlad27aug> and .live is deprecated
[07:27:13] <dabear_> vlad27aug: doesn't matter, it will be super easy to put it back if ever removed
[07:27:18] <zim> Ah OK so I should .on from now on
[07:27:41] <dabear_> .live uses .on internally
[07:27:48] <dabear_> this is actually the whole .live implementation
[07:27:52] <dabear_> jQuery( this.context ).on( types, this.selector, data, fn ); return this;
[07:28:21] <skylamer`> where 'data' is?
[07:28:41] <vlad27aug> dabear_: yes...but if it is to be removed on a future jquery version you would have to modify your projects that use .live
[07:28:54] <dabear_> vlad27aug: not a problem?
[07:29:10] <dabear_> you would never ever just upgrade jquery without doing testing
[07:29:29] <dabear_> and the modification would be 3-4 lines
[07:30:17] <vlad27aug> not quite...when using live you can add multiple events...and each event with it's own handler function
[07:30:32] <vlad27aug> instead with on you can attach only one handler function...to one or more events
[07:30:57] <studio_> hi, i'm looking for a lightbox plugin that can handle ajax form submits without redirecting the whole page - any suggestions? colorbox which i thought was the answer, turns out to be a problem instead
[07:31:02] <vlad27aug> if you use live and then are required to change...you would have to go and manually replace every occurrence of the live with on
[07:31:11] <dabear_> vlad27aug: nope
[07:31:16] <vlad27aug> and it's best practices not to use deprecated api anyway
[07:31:52] <dabear_> you would simply just add $.fn.live =function( types, data, fn ) {jQuery( this.context ).on( types, this.selector, data, fn );return this}
[07:32:24] <zim> why do you have to use a double selector in .on $("#content").on("focus", ".ajax_added", function (){    <- vs ->    $('.ajax_added').live('focus', function {
[07:32:29] <vlad27aug> this means modifying the jquery itslef
[07:32:43] <dabear_> vlad27aug: nope, can be added as a small plugin
[07:33:17] <dabear_> zim: becasue you have different contexts
[07:33:38] <vlad27aug> yes...but why would you want to do this when you can right your code with .on from the beginning?
[07:33:40] <dabear_> zim: .live attaches events on the document node, while with on you're attaching events to #content
[07:33:57] <vlad27aug> *can write
[07:34:10] <dabear_> vlad27aug: dunno, easier to read, you might be stubborn, there can be other reasons
[07:34:18] <vlad27aug> :))
[07:35:02] <vlad27aug> I guess I'm just in favor of writing NEW code with .on instead of .live
[07:35:12] <zim> the only real problem is if the relocate the live function in jquery unlikely
[07:35:20] <dabear_> personally I like to use a combo of .delegate + .bind rather than .on directly
[07:35:29] <vlad27aug> if you have legacy code that uses .live alot than I think you can think of other solutions like the one you mentioned
[07:36:37] <dabear_> nope, but as I said, I like delegate better
[07:37:12] <zim> dabear_: is there an example of that anywhere I am starting a new project that will have loads of ajax content being loaded all the time an I need my script to just work
[07:37:23] <dabear_> mostly because the two first params are reversed in .on vs .delegate
[07:38:12] <dabear_> $("table").delegate("td", "click", fn) is like having a table where i delegate td clicks to a function
[07:38:17] <dabear_> which is logical
[07:39:15] <dabear_> $("table").on("click", "td", fn) is not that logical to read
[07:39:20] <dabear_> if you'd ask me
[07:39:48] <vlad27aug> well it's like onclick...almost js native
[07:40:26] <vlad27aug> but this is a matter of taste...we would never reach a common conclusion :)
[07:42:00] <PhonicUK> any of you guys not seen Alpine for jquery yet?
[07:42:46] <KOTRET> dear fans of REST services: how you format the json stuff info the formfields and reverse format the inputs? internationalisation?
[07:43:29] <KOTRET> especially with form validation this is pain...
[07:44:04] <ale__> Hello guys, is there any way to do a $('#div').scroll(... ?
[07:44:40] <shoky> ale__: $('#div').scrollTop(200)
[07:45:13] <ale__> shoky: but I want to know when the user scrolled that div, is this the same?
[07:45:26] <shoky> ah
[07:45:38] <zim> PhonicUK: ref, link, something to go on?
[07:45:39] <shoky> then .scroll(function(e) { ... } ) is fine
[07:46:05] <PhonicUK> zim, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lGwqi8L_g
[07:46:09] <ale__> but it's not working!
[07:46:50] <shoky> then jsfiddle it
[07:47:13] <vlad27aug> it should work...make sure the #div exists at the time you bind the scroll event to it
[07:48:27] <zim> PhonicUK: looks line an IDE for people who can't get to grips with css
[07:48:48] <PhonicUK> it does a few more things than just the visual designer :)
[07:49:23] <zim> explain
[07:49:32] <PhonicUK> it glues a lot of things for you
[07:49:45] <PhonicUK> double clicking on a control lets you start immediately writing code for its default event
[07:49:50] <innociv> KOTRET, $('form').serialize()?
[07:49:54] <PhonicUK> the server provides a bunch of extra data handling services as well
[07:50:17] <PhonicUK> lets you do extremely rapid development of small apps
[07:51:05] <zim> KOTRET: I use a load of that kind of thing will give you some examples
[07:51:26] <ale__> shojy: http://jsfiddle.net/4XwX5/
[07:51:33] <ale__> shoky:something like that
[07:52:21] <shoky> ale__: http://jsfiddle.net/4XwX5/1/
[07:52:27] <shoky> jquery now included
[07:52:38] <shoky> check your console
[07:54:07] <vlad27aug> PhonicUK: the alpine project looks very interesting...thanks for sharing
[07:54:34] <PhonicUK> vlad27aug, i'm posting updates on twitter @PhonicUK as I continue developing it
[07:54:41] <PhonicUK> its going to be at alpineframework.com
[07:54:48] <studio_> sorry, i asked earlier, but got cut off - can anyone recommend a decent lightbox plugin that can handle ajax content and submitting of forms from inside the box please?
[07:54:53] <PhonicUK> theres actually an earlier version at that site to play with for people I give a login to
[07:56:10] <vlad27aug> PhonicUK: when will you release a public version?
[07:56:41] <PhonicUK> i'm planning to have semi-public tech previews in June, and a formal public beta around August
[07:57:27] <vlad27aug> well success with that...looks like nice work
[07:57:34] <vlad27aug> will wait until August then :)
[07:57:34] <studio_> what's this PhonicUK? sounds interesting
[07:57:52] <PhonicUK> its a web based development environment i've been building
[07:57:53] <zim> KOTRET: here is an eg of how most of my ajax is handled http://jsfiddle.net/s2ysT/
[07:57:58] <KOTRET> innociv, zim: especially struggeling with the architecture: convert + validate + send or better prevalidate (ajax to script which does convert + validate) and then sending
[07:58:08] <studio_> PhonicUK: so, dreamweaver?
[07:58:18] <PhonicUK> no, its meant for web applications not websites/pages
[07:58:28] <studio_> so, eclipse then?
[07:58:35] <PhonicUK> not really no
[07:58:38] <studio_> phpstorm? netbeans?
[07:58:41] <PhonicUK> have you watchted the video?
[07:58:54] <studio_> no because i've not seen any links
[07:58:58] <PhonicUK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lGwqi8L_g
[07:59:00] <innociv> You can convert the forms to json with .serialize().  The rest is the matter of reading those values.
[07:59:07] <PhonicUK> thats a video of it in action
[07:59:11] <PhonicUK> shows you what it does
[07:59:16] <ale__> shoky: my mistake! thanks :D
[07:59:41] <KOTRET> zim: this requires the REST-return to be conform to your page elements... imho a bad design
[08:00:02] <studio_> and if the web browser crashes?
[08:00:02] <PhonicUK> studio_, a lot of people refer to it as like a visual basic for the web
[08:00:11] <PhonicUK> studio_, if youve saved recently then not much
[08:00:22] <PhonicUK> the projects are stored on the server
[08:00:23] <studio_> well clearly i can see why
[08:00:37] <PhonicUK> and thats pretty much what I'm going for
[08:00:43] <PhonicUK> drag and drop UI, double click to start coding
[08:00:53] <PhonicUK> most of it glued together for you
[08:01:18] <studio_> i'm not sure why people would want to use it?
[08:01:36] <PhonicUK> because you can build certain types of app very quickly with it
[08:01:45] <zim> KOTRET: why? it means that I can create an array containing the elements  I would like to update and pass it back
[08:01:45] <PhonicUK> and a few people are very interested in its educational benefits
[08:01:48] <studio_> such as?
[08:01:57] <studio_> what type of apps? hello world apps?
[08:02:02] <PhonicUK> data driven apps
[08:02:03] <vlad27aug> studio_: for small applications, demos...other stuff
[08:02:11] <PhonicUK> it does data binding in some cool ways
[08:02:24] <PhonicUK> also a simple IDE that students can use at school without the school having to install new software, and that the students can then carry on using at home
[08:02:29] <studio_> as a fully trained ict school teacher, i can tell you teachers teach the underlying principles, not click this button, click that etc.
[08:02:30] <PhonicUK> has raised a few heads
[08:02:42] <KOTRET> zim: in general its okay but then you need to name the elements on your pages everytime the same way
[08:02:58] <KOTRET> the rest should not be page-specific
[08:03:15] <PhonicUK> studio_, you're doing better than they do here in the UK then where ICT classes are basically teaching students what they already know about productivity applications
[08:03:24] <PhonicUK> no programming until A levels at the moment
[08:03:28] <PhonicUK> in most places
[08:03:30] <studio_> PhonicUK: that's wrong
[08:03:45] <studio_> you speak of incompetent ict teachers. not all ict
[08:03:47] <zim> KOTRET: will add the php side for you to look at
[08:03:53] <studio_> clearly you've not heard of dida / cida
[08:04:16] <PhonicUK> ive yet to hear of a secondary school in england where that's not the case
[08:04:44] <studio_> as it abstracts so much away from the pupil, it's hardly "educational" nor "beneficial" imo
[08:04:50] <studio_> PhonicUK: so start listening
[08:05:12] <PhonicUK> eitherway its not what I'm building it for, a few people have just said they're interesting in using it
[08:05:13] <studio_> dida / cida has been around for at least 4-5 years
[08:05:37] <studio_> so charge them then
[08:05:45] <PhonicUK> i plan to :P
[08:05:54] <PhonicUK> lol alpine is being built as commercial software
[08:05:58] <studio_> heh
[08:06:03] <studio_> good luck with that
[08:06:13] <PhonicUK> free to build apps, pay to deploy
[08:06:23] <PhonicUK> already got a waiting list of people waiting for it
[08:06:59] <studio_> that demo could be done in 1 line of jquery. i don't understand how it can be beneficial. data driven apps will be immensely insecure unless you constantly update
[08:07:04] <studio_> just take a look towards drupal for that
[08:07:14] <studio_> or wordpress, or any web app
[08:07:35] <KOTRET> zim: more important for me is: how you format the REST-results and how to pass the formvalues to it regarding internationalisation
[08:07:40] <studio_> people waiting to use it, are not paying customers
[08:08:15] <zim> http://jsfiddle.net/s2ysT/2/ have also added my post form method
[08:08:16] <vlad27aug> PhonicUK: and if you will have success with it being a commercial application someone will create an opensource version in notime :)
[08:08:30] <studio_> they're just hangers on. if you're trying to break into the educational field, trust me. it's an anally retentive field, and unless you have bags of cash to promote it, or are a mega teacher, you'll have great difficulty
[08:08:36] <PhonicUK> vlad27aug, thats what everyone keeps saying about my other projects, never happens xD
[08:08:42] <studio_> vlad27aug: shhh, don't spoil the dream ;)
[08:08:46] <PhonicUK> well cash is something I do have ;)
[08:08:48] <vlad27aug> :)))
[08:08:52] <vlad27aug> good luck
[08:08:55] <studio_> vlad27aug: they already have though, scite + jquery + firefox
[08:09:38] <PhonicUK> i've even got a way for alpine to build Win32 executables :)
[08:09:41] <PhonicUK> which is the really clever bit
[08:09:48] <studio_> PhonicUK: i said bags of. i don't think you understand the concept of selling to schools. as you've not heard of cida/dida you clearly don't have your ear to the ground
[08:10:18] <PhonicUK> studio_, schools aren't a market i'm deliberately aiming for. its purely that a couple of educators have said its something they'd like to have access to
[08:10:31] <PhonicUK> im just building what I want to build and letting everyone else use it how they want
[08:10:48] <PhonicUK> no particular target market or direction
[08:10:53] <studio_> well clearly you're not., they'll be wanting to use it... for free
[08:11:22] <zim> PhonicUK: IMHO kids at school should be given vim. that is why raspberry pi was born they don't learn whats going on
[08:11:33] <studio_> you'll not be able to monitise it, especially when you get sued because of the insecurities in your app cause data loss / theft
[08:11:58] <studio_> zim: vim is overated. nano ftw ;:)
[08:12:04] <PhonicUK> lol
[08:12:05] <zim> LOL
[08:12:11] <shoky> nano++
[08:12:11] <shoky> ;D
[08:12:22] <PhonicUK> I think dropping students straight into the command line when they've only used GUIs all their life is going to alienate them from programming
[08:12:24] <Vorspire> sued due to data loss? lol...
[08:12:26] <zim> my point a text editor
[08:13:14] <ale__> Guys, how can I get the last element of a list of links? http://jsfiddle.net/4XwX5/3/
[08:13:16] <PhonicUK> thats an odd idea too, i'm not holding onto anyones data - just making it easy for data sources to be manipulated and used
[08:13:28] <vlad27aug> there is a gui for vim also...they can use that at the beginning...until they become adults and would want to use vim the cool way :)
[08:13:51] <vlad27aug> ale_: .last()
[08:13:54] <zim> PhonicUK: go look at the raspberry pi project. It proves that unless they get there hands dirty they never get past the GUI
[08:13:55] <PhonicUK> ale__ $("#divv").children().last();
[08:13:57] <studio_> newsflash. if your app spits out code that allows data to be accessed insecurely and causes problems, guess who's fault it is
[08:14:03] <PhonicUK> zim, I've already got one pre-ordered
[08:14:15] <shoky> ale__: you fix your HTML and selector: http://jsfiddle.net/4XwX5/5/
[08:14:19] <Vorspire> I wish I could sue Microsoft for the untold amount of GB of data I've lost due to their poor O/S.
[08:14:40] <PhonicUK> Vorspire, that just means your backups aren't good enough :P
[08:14:43] <studio_> Vorspire: stop being lazy, you should backup
[08:14:46] <ale__> thanks!!
[08:14:46] <zim> +1 sue MS**t
[08:15:16] <Vorspire> Why backup when I know how to recover? waste of space.
[08:15:22] <studio_> also, if you discover a bug, how are you going to fix it in the apps pre made
[08:15:34] <PhonicUK> Vorspire, hard to recover from hardware failure
[08:15:35] <studio_> you're not going to be able to
[08:15:42] <PhonicUK> if data doesn't exist in 3 places, it doesn't exist
[08:15:57] <zim> KOTRET: any comments?
[08:16:08] <PhonicUK> RAID for hardware redundancy, live on-site backups for quick restoration, regular off-site backups for emergencies
[08:16:41] <studio_> "educators" pay for jack because schools are some of the most poorly funded services considering the fees it incurs
[08:17:24] <studio_> so, good luck selling it to educators. and also, good luck selling it to people who can't be able to use something already existsing like, uhm, drupal / wordpress / opencart / what have you
[08:18:05] <studio_> hate to say it, but i think you're losing the practicality of the project over the geekiness of it
[08:18:11] <Vorspire> Microsoft should stop being lazy and actually write an O/S that works properly. But thanks to the fact that there are more possible outcomes to an ASM instruction than there are observable atoms in the universe, I suppose it's hard to work out all of the bugs.
[08:18:17] <zim> +1 for that as well having a major barny with Harrow as there ICT is based on Office 2003 YES Harrow
[08:19:05] <studio_> zim? so, pay for the upgrade if you're that upset
[08:19:41] <studio_> otherwise be glad it wasn't openoffice
[08:19:48] <zim> Not my kids but the point is it is one of the most well funded schools in the UK (your point)
[08:20:08] <studio_> most well funded? how did you work that out?
[08:20:26] <PhonicUK> 'well funded school' sounds like an oxymoron if its state funded
[08:20:33] <studio_> is there a top ten list of "most well funded schools in the uk" that i'm missing
[08:21:03] <fommil> Hi all, I have a reverse jQuery question: I regularly use a badly designed website which inappropriately uses the following hack: $('input').attr('autocomplete','off'); Is there any way to override this using client side plugins? (Not greasemonkey)
[08:21:13] <zim> http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/ != State School
[08:21:39] <studio_> in terms of what secondary kids do, nothing has changed from office 2000
[08:21:47] <PhonicUK> private schools don't count, they're for parents who can afford to buy their kids better opportunities than everyone else
[08:21:51] <studio_> a few menu wording options here and there, but that's it
[08:22:28] <studio_> i wouldn't be concerned what software my kids learn on, rather how good the teachers are. the underlying principles are what matters, not what button to click
[08:23:06] <PhonicUK> I'd have a hard time imagining teaching pointer arithmatic to year 8 students
[08:23:20] <zim> I was just making studio_ point if Harrow still use Orifice 2003 then what hope is there for any of the others
[08:23:20] <studio_> after doing county staff training days, i can safely say some 80% of ict teachers don't understand the principles
[08:23:32] <shoky> fommil: you can easily make an extension to do that for you, sure
[08:23:35] <zim> and no that is not a typo
[08:23:58] <PhonicUK> i can't say thats a supprise, i've always regarded programming effectively as a lifelong skill
[08:24:17] <PhonicUK> like langauges its one of those things you need to start with early
[08:24:22] <studio_> zim: you're missing the point completely, and if you had a clue, you'd understand word is perhaps one of the best well-programmed applications for windows there is
[08:24:45] <studio_> so call it what you what. fact is bill gates is rich and you aren't ;)
[08:24:57] <PhonicUK> he's also one of the worlds great philanthropists
[08:25:12] <PhonicUK> i'm amazed I spelt that correctly first time around
[08:25:14] <fommil> shoky: I think all it would do would be to ignore Javascript requests to disable the autocompleter! :-) Keeping the user id stored on a sticky on my desktop is the path of least resistance. If such a plugin (or mechanism) existed, I would spend some time to get it set up. But not a day or two learning browser plugins and Objective C to do so...
[08:25:41] <studio_> programming is actually taught in primary school
[08:25:52] <studio_> with logo, the turtle thing
[08:25:58] <shoky> fommil: i was thinking of a simple javascript chrome extension
[08:25:59] <zim> studio_: Just prejudiced by the amount of time I spend dealing with Outlook part of Orifice
[08:26:06] <PhonicUK> i remember logo, I don't really consider that programming
[08:26:07] <studio_> it's in the curriculum. teachers just don't understand it
[08:26:12] <fommil> shoky: what about in Safari?
[08:26:20] <studio_> zim: so learn how to use outlook?
[08:26:32] <zim> WHy?
[08:26:36] <shoky> fommil: i don't know safari. you cant make extensions in javascript?
[08:27:02] <fommil> shoky: I don't know what language it uses for plugins. I'll look into it
[08:27:08] <zim> I like imap it it makes everything imap a pain
[08:27:09] <studio_> PhonicUK: then you're sadly mistaken. it's introducing programming. it's giving commands to a neat little robot. it's programming
[08:28:03] <PhonicUK> studio_, its almost certainly a training issue - ive never seen logo used for anything except repeating patterns
[08:28:06] <PhonicUK> no decision making
[08:28:09] <studio_> programming is also taught in year 7 ict, and design and tech
[08:28:23] <studio_> PhonicUK: what do you think a function is?
[08:28:49] <studio_> conditions come later. why is that so difficult to understand?
[08:29:04] <studio_> traffic light controller ftw
[08:29:08] <PhonicUK> i think you've slightly misunderstood what I said
[08:29:28] <studio_> a repeating pattern is a function / routine / whatever you want to refer to it as
[08:29:29] <fommil> shoky: http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html hurrah! This might not be too bad. Any hints on how to go about ignoring Javascript requests to disable the autocompleter?
[08:29:55] <PhonicUK> the point i was making is that's all ive seen logo used to do, never situations where it will do either one thing or another in response to an input
[08:29:56] <shoky> fommil: re-enabling it is no good?
[08:30:08] <studio_> it's programming. the teacher may not be going "today children we're looking at an important concept used in computer programming", it's just taught as repeating routines, instructions and commands.
[08:30:28] <fommil> shoky: I think disabling autocomplete is a stupid thing to do. It is something the user wants and to hell with what the website designer thinks on this point!
[08:30:38] <studio_> PhonicUK: no, because logo isn't supposed to be conditional. you send it fd 100, not fd 100 if the day is tuesday
[08:31:15] <PhonicUK> right, in 'useful' programming you're almost never doing a linear series of events - you're doing different things in response to inputs from the outside world
[08:31:19] <PhonicUK> input -> process -> output
[08:31:25] <studio_> heh
[08:31:34] <studio_> 'useful' programming to kids
[08:31:37] <fommil> shoky: bollocks, $99/year to get a cert to be able to develop extensions
[08:31:49] <shoky> fommil: fuck apple, fuck safari
[08:32:08] <PhonicUK> even something as simple as 'if i push this button, go around in a circle, if i push this other button, make a square'
[08:32:14] <shoky> fommil: dont change the website, change the browser
[08:32:14] <studio_> i'd say at least 50% of programs run without external responses
[08:32:17] <fommil> shoky: I wonder if there is a personal cert way to do it - must be. I could just mark the cert trusted
[08:32:24] <fommil> shoky: nah, Safari is great
[08:32:29] <PhonicUK> only in embedded systems, and even then
[08:32:44] <shoky> it's shite if you need $99 to make a simple extension
[08:33:02] <studio_> military / industrial
[08:33:05] <studio_> big industries
[08:33:15] <PhonicUK> they're *never* in response to no input
[08:33:20] <fommil> shoky: I actually agree with a web of trust when it comes to certs. I'll be able to create a private one - just means if I were to give it to you, you'd need to manually authorise my self signed cert
[08:33:36] <shoky> fommil: no idea
[08:33:40] <PhonicUK> industrial robots always have inputs they're responding to
[08:33:55] <studio_> PhonicUK: but functions are sections of code that can run without inputs, just the same as a repeating pattern of logo can. why do you not understand this?
[08:34:14] <PhonicUK> of course i understand this, but you're doing a spectacular job at missing my point entirely
[08:34:22] <zim> shoky: http://www.stickycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/update_for_your_computer.jpg
[08:34:42] <shoky> zim: indeed
[08:36:03] <PhonicUK> i assert that teaching students just to write functions that will always do the same thing is not as useful as teaching them how computer programs can make decisions and take different courses of action depending on those decisions
[08:36:13] <studio_> i think you're saying that your app is going to make you millions, and i'm lol'ing because it's just a abstraction with no educational content, and introduces loads of security risks depending on your code so has no real-world use and so nobody will want to pay for it and the underlying skills are easy to master and ironically faster to use existing opensource tools / solutions
[08:36:13] <PhonicUK> decisions made usually in response to external inputs or data
[08:36:45] * shoky thought that PhonicUK was full of himself. then i met studio_
[08:36:56] <studio_> "they're kids" not 'students'. kids who would be around 9. you can't teach them all the concepts of programming in one week
[08:37:11] <studio_> shoky: have we met? no. feel free to introduce yourself though
[08:37:17] <shoky> whut? hi
[08:37:23] <zim> studio_: by that logic it will as there is no common sense with that kind of budget.
[08:37:41] <PhonicUK> studio_, of course not but you're pulling a slippery slope on me
[08:38:07] <PhonicUK> im not saying that students need to be taught lots of programming concepts, but simple decision making is about one of the first things that comes up right after hello world
[08:38:18] <PhonicUK> i was about 7 when i started learning C
[08:38:22] <studio_> it will what zim?
[08:38:27] <zim> PhonicUK: The long and the short of it is good luck
[08:38:31] <PhonicUK> indeed
[08:38:32] <PhonicUK> lol
[08:38:33] <zim> make millions
[08:38:45] <studio_> PhonicUK: good luck teaching hello world to 9 year old kids
[08:38:46] <PhonicUK> i'm not after making millions
[08:39:02] <shoky> yea you already got cash
[08:39:05] <PhonicUK> i've already got stuff that makes my money, i just want to make something cool
[08:39:05] <studio_> hopefully not even tens
[08:39:40] <zim> but you will as most geeks would feel as we do and no one ever listens to us. LOL
[08:40:04] <studio_> if you think you can teach kids control flow/ instructions / functions / events / inputs / in one sitting, then sit back down and have a read of the national curriculum
[08:41:04] <PhonicUK> you'd be supprised how many can understand most of that with the cooking recipie analogy
[08:41:16] <studio_> input and control flow is in the design / craft curriculum. there that'll save you some understanding time
[08:41:29] <PhonicUK> most of the guys i graduated with started early
[08:41:36] <PhonicUK> granted there were only 8 of us and 6 of us had 1sts xD
[08:41:38] <studio_> PhonicUK: you have no concept of classroom experience?
[08:42:20] <zim> PhonicUK: when was that?
[08:42:27] <PhonicUK> when was what sorry?
[08:42:30] <studio_> if you say no, they you're talking bs. as a school teacher, i'm telling you, they won't. 1 in 100 may, 20 in that 100 may appear that they do. the rest will not undertstnd it.
[08:42:42] <zim> whaen you graduated
[08:42:47] <PhonicUK> june last year
[08:42:56] <studio_> newsflash. teaching is not about what happened to *you*
[08:42:58] <PhonicUK> computer systems engineering BSc
[08:43:16] <PhonicUK> started with a class of 32, size dropped in half each academic year
[08:43:53] <studio_> still you're fresh out of uni, believe you're the greatest thing ever (don't take it personally, every graduate does - it's what you pay unis to do) and have yet to find out the reality that your uni didn't prepare you fo
[08:43:57] <studio_> r
[08:44:00] <fommil> shoky: I think you might have just got me addicted to creating Safari plugins! ;-)
[08:44:18] <shoky> fommil: you just needed a nudge ;p
[08:44:34] <PhonicUK> studio_, the reality is I already make 6 figures selling my existing software and will continue to make more :P
[08:44:47] <PhonicUK> i'm in a fairly good position to be arrogant
[08:44:47] <studio_> haha
[08:44:51] <studio_> hahaha
[08:45:02] <PhonicUK> go and google "McMyAdmin" then look at the customer list
[08:45:14] <studio_> hahahaha
[08:45:16] <PhonicUK> i work with almost every major hosting company in the EU and US
[08:45:30] <zim> OK. I still feel that 1. Kids who hack the school network should get a merit not expelled. 2. Kids should start programming in a text editor. 3. The ones who copy from the book and don't change anything shold learn word the others should be taught to program
[08:45:39] <underech> I could be wrong, but I think there is a difference between a "node" and an "element". Again, I could be wrong, but jQuery returns wrapped elements, right? So how can I get the node from the element $('tag', xmldocument)[0]?
[08:46:25] <fommil> shoky: and it appears the certs are free after all :-)
[08:47:34] <vlad27aug> underech: yes...that should work
[08:48:00] <vlad27aug> and you can use $('tag', xmldocument).get(index)
[08:48:20] <vlad27aug> where index is a zero based integer of the node you want to get from the collection
[08:48:23] <studio_> "McMyAdmin allows you to easily manage Mincraft Survival Server installations via a simple and attractive web interface. Available to download now!"
[08:48:27] <studio_> mincraft. lol
[08:48:42] <studio_> EVERY major host has mincraft survival server
[08:48:50] <underech> vlad27aug: I think that is giving me an element, rather than a node? Basically the library I am using (Jath) expects me to give it a node (something that responds to eveluate), at that ^ doesnt do it...
[08:48:51] <PhonicUK> such a huge market that even my slice is enough to make me happy
[08:48:59] <PhonicUK> and soon it won't just be Minecraft
[08:49:03] <studio_> available to dl, but available to dl
[08:49:13] <studio_> so, uhm, you sell it huh
[08:49:15] <studio_> hahaha
[08:49:17] <PhonicUK> yep
[08:49:25] <studio_> EVERY MAJOR HOST!
[08:49:31] <PhonicUK> many have tried to make open source clones, all have failed
[08:49:41] <studio_> EVERY MAJOR HOST IN THE EU AND US
[08:49:48] <studio_> yawn
[08:49:55] <PhonicUK> almost every major host in the EU and US, reselling it to their customers
[08:50:08] <xec> underech: my understanding is that every element is a node, but you can have text nodes (which are not elements) - i could be mistaken though. when you do [n] on a jquery collection you get the native DOM element rather than a jquery object
[08:50:19] <vlad27aug> underech: it should return a DOM node...not sure what kind of a node that Jath library expects
[08:50:32] <tomasm-> hi, i found this interesting 'fancy zoom' lightbox plugin.... the code is 3 years old and there are few odd lines... one is: $( $(this).attr('href') ).hide() and .show() .... jquery says "unrecognized expression" (being the picture's url), and I'm wondering what the heck it's trying to do, and how to update it to something working
[08:50:42] <studio_> seems to have a shitload of problems according to teh forum. i think you should get bug fixing
[08:51:02] <PhonicUK> it has a shitload of users, of course some are going to have issues :P
[08:51:04] <PhonicUK> thats life
[08:51:56] <studio_> word has a shitload more of uusers. i've not run into any bugs
[08:52:08] <studio_> you mean "that's life for my shitty software"
[08:52:20] <shoky> jquery, anyone?
[08:52:35] <studio_> http://xkcd.com/386/
[08:52:47] <xec> tomasm-: i agree, that does look weird, what is the context?
[08:53:16] <underech> vlad27aug: Yeah, me neither (obviously). If I give Jath the response from $.ajax loading an XML document all is good. My issue is that I want to give it just a bit of that XML document, so I figured Id use jQuery to select the bit I want and pass it in. But like I said, the bit of the document I select does not respond to evaluate (in the same was as the document root does).
[08:53:53] <tomasm-> xec, that literally is it. this.each(function() { $( $(this).attr('href') ).hide(); });
[08:54:01] <zim> I was wondering how long I off topic twittering  would go unchallenged  lol
[08:54:20] <studio_> well that was fun! bs'ers are what make irc go around
[08:54:22] <studio_> :)
[08:54:41] <shoky> you can resume for all i care
[08:54:46] <PhonicUK> lol
[08:55:50] <zim> OK. .delegate vs .on and will .delegate last?
[08:55:50] <vlad27aug> underech: so if I understand correctly it works if you send it a valid xml document...then the problem is that the second time you are not sending an xml document...but a DOM node...which are different things
[08:56:06] <underech> vlad27aug: I guess so
[08:56:15] <xec> zim: .on() is preferred in 1.7+
[08:56:34] <vlad27aug> you could try getting that piece of the xml with $('some selector').html()
[08:56:34] <xec> zim: but i don't expect .delegate() to disappear any time soon
[08:56:45] <vlad27aug> and make sure the thing you retrieved is xml valid
[08:57:15] <zim> what is the diff between them other than the order
[08:57:45] <vlad27aug> .delegate calls .on...so not much difference except from the parameter order
[08:57:47] <xec> zim: .on() can do simple binds too
[08:58:06] <vlad27aug> ohh....and that also...obviously
[08:58:12] <zim> xec pls elaborate
[08:58:24] <shoky> zim see ?on
[08:58:25] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:58:40] <xec> zim: .on() doesn't just replace .delegate(), it replaces .bind() and .live() as well
[08:58:50] <xec> or supercedes, rather
[08:58:54] <vlad27aug> .on is for event binding as .ajax is for ajax calls
[08:59:08] <vlad27aug> the other stuff are just aliases
[08:59:31] <zim> vlad27aug: so .post is going to?
[08:59:46] <xec> no, it's just shorthand
[08:59:54] <xec> vlad is confusing you :P
[09:00:06] <sa2304> .post() is wrapper for .ajax()
[09:00:07] <vlad27aug> going as in removed?...I don't think so...they are just aliases to make the code more expressive
[09:00:10] <shoky> just read the docs, why ask on irc '\
[09:00:11] <shoky> :\
[09:00:23] <zim> .live is shorthand for .on but that is going
[09:00:35] <shoky> .live is not shorthand for .on
[09:00:42] <vlad27aug> yes...live is the only old binding function that is deprecated
[09:00:50] <vlad27aug> with it's twin brother ".off"
[09:01:07] <vlad27aug> sorry...I meant .die
[09:01:14] <zim> .live jQuery( this.context ).on( types, this.selector, data, fn ); return this;
[09:01:20] <shoky> exactly
[09:01:29] <shoky> the  jQuery( this.context )   part
[09:01:30] <shoky> is not .on
[09:01:33] <shoky> and it is the important bit.
[09:02:25] <shoky> and it is the reason for deprecation
[09:02:27] <zim> OK.
[09:04:39] <sa2304> ?ok
[09:04:41] <bot-t> sa2304, QUnit/ok - http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/ok
[09:04:53] <shoky> s'all copacetic
[09:06:02] <sa2304> oh I mean...
[09:06:04] <sa2304> ?on
[09:06:05] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:06:09] <sa2304> :)
[09:12:38] <tomasm-> hi, if a function is added to $.fn.something, like $.fn.something.open = function() { ... }, is that something I can call on an object like $(foo).something().open() ? or is there a way I can add a function to an object, but only to certain objects in context of a plugin? ie have a custom open() method mean something special (this is for a fancyzoom)
[09:13:42] <xenaxon> help. how can I animate a background color?
[09:13:57] <xec> css3!
[09:13:57] <Vorspire> 1) yes, 2) it depends on the scope of your functions, if you nest the functions inside your extension function then they will only be available to that object after the subsequent extension function call
[09:14:07] <xenaxon> I want to make a div's background from transparent to black
[09:14:10] <Vorspire> @tomasm-
[09:14:20] <ajpiano> ?jquery.color @ xenaxon
[09:14:21] <bot-t> xenaxon, Color Animations - Plugins - jQuery - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery 1.2, and newer. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[09:14:35] <ajpiano> ?g jquery color plugin github
[09:14:36] <bot-t> ajpiano, jquery/jquery-color  GitHub - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[09:14:41] <ajpiano> ^^
[09:14:44] <tomasm-> Vorspire, so just have $.fn.something.open defined inside $.fn.something ?
[09:14:46] <xenaxon> lol
[09:14:54] <vlad27aug> xenaxon: you can just animate the opacity css attribute
[09:14:56] <xenaxon> I need to use a plugin to make a div's background black?
[09:15:04] <xenaxon> the div has text
[09:15:07] <xenaxon> it has to appear at all times
[09:15:16] <xenaxon> only the background needs to go from transparent to black
[09:15:17] <ajpiano> xenaxon: color animations aren't built into jquery core, that's just how it is
[09:15:36] <ajpiano> tomasm-: no that won't work
[09:15:39] <xenaxon> ajpiano, can you show me an example of how that would work
[09:15:49] <zim> xenaxon: this may be a problem I have been having is it set to transparent in the css? in which case it will be $new_color but still transparent
[09:16:07] <vlad27aug> you can set the background of the div to black..and set the opacity to 0...and after that animate the opacity from 0 to 1
[09:16:08] <xenaxon> it's not set to anything
[09:16:11] <xenaxon> it's just default
[09:16:16] <xenaxon> as in... no background at all
[09:16:21] <xenaxon> and I am making it black on hover
[09:16:24] <ajpiano> tomasm-: more like $.fn.something = function() {  return { open: function() {} }; });
[09:16:25] <xenaxon> but I want it to animate
[09:16:25] <Vorspire> explaining the particularities of scope and object availablility isn't something that can be easily conveyed on a 25 year old chat service :P
[09:16:31] <xenaxon> in 0.7 sec
[09:16:45] <vlad27aug> if you set it to black and with opacity 0 it would be as if it has not background
[09:16:58] <xenaxon> the div has text
[09:17:01] <xenaxon> it has to appear at all times
[09:17:04] <vlad27aug> but then when you animate the opacity it will start to show more "blackness"
[09:17:05] <ajpiano> xenaxon: $("#foo").animate({backgroundColor: "#000"}, 7000
[09:17:05] <xenaxon> only the background needs to go from transparent to black
[09:17:17] <PhonicUK> xenaxon, start with a background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0);
[09:17:18] <vlad27aug> hmmmm....I see
[09:17:25] <ajpiano> xenaxon: if you have black text and you are making the background black you are gonna have to change the color of the text
[09:17:29] <PhonicUK> then animate the color to whateer you want
[09:17:40] <xenaxon> yes, need to reverse the text
[09:17:50] <xenaxon> the text is white
[09:17:54] <xenaxon> the bg is transparent at start
[09:18:02] <xenaxon> at the end the text is still white
[09:18:04] <ajpiano> xenaxon: less talking more trying
[09:18:08] <xenaxon> ok
[09:18:14] <PhonicUK> lol
[09:18:27] <xenaxon> I haven't worked with rgba
[09:18:27] <tomasm-> ajpiano, any chance functions declared inside that via "function open() { ... } " would be accessible? they are actual functions and not assigned to attributes/keys in an object/hash.... or is extend() better, to add that function to the object hash, as you suggest?
[09:18:32] <PhonicUK> TIAS goes a long way :)
[09:18:55] <ajpiano> tomasm-: ultimately i don't recommend the pattern you're trying to do at all
[09:19:15] <ajpiano> tomasm-: i think that using the jquery ui widget factory pattern of $("something").thingie("method") works a lot better
[09:19:28] <ajpiano> cause it doesn't destroy the jquery chain but also lets you get at internal methods etc
[09:19:55] <tomasm-> ajpiano, i'm familiar with that, but this is an existing plugin i'm trying to expose an internal function
[09:20:12] <ajpiano> tomasm-: easy enough to do that with this method as well
[09:20:19] <tomasm-> ajpiano, why not just use $.extend(this, { open: function() { ... } }); ?
[09:20:51] <tomasm-> ajpiano, without radically changing the constructor, that is
[09:20:55] <ajpiano> cause then what happens after you calll the method
[09:21:09] <ajpiano> you have to retrun the same object again
[09:21:18] <ajpiano> tomasm-: you don't want to change the constructor, just the return value ;p ?
[09:21:31] <zim> with .on is there a down side to using a very wide opening element like $('#site_wrapper').on('click', '.something_very_deep', function(){ ?
[09:22:21] <ajpiano> zim it's "better" to go lower but also you ahve to use an element that will be there on the page the whole time, so do what works best for your app
[09:22:59] <zim> #site_wrapper it is then :-)
[09:23:36] <rodd> Hello, is there any way that I can set my plugin to a 'live' state, that is, enable it to newly added items? short example: $( '.box' ).myPlugin(); that obviously won't trigger for new elements, added by an ajax call
[09:23:39] <zim> ajpiano: what are the pros of going lower?
[09:23:49] <ale__> Guys, I want to do an infinite scroller but for a div called #mydiv, how can I translate this: if($(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() - $(window).height()) { ..} to what I need ?
[09:24:03] <ajpiano> zim: marginally better perf
[09:24:05] <ale__> for the div to scroll
[09:24:52] <zim> ajpiano: Bah we all have overpowered puters now :-)
[09:25:34] <zim> ajpiano: Ty will stop panicking
[09:26:55] <ajpiano> :)
[09:27:01] <wkmanire> Mornin.
[09:27:12] <wkmanire> Can I pass an array of promises to when?
[09:27:13] <ale__> Is it possible?
[09:27:16] <ajpiano> mornin wkmanire
[09:27:27] <ajpiano> wkmanire: $.when.apply( $, arrayOfPromises )
[09:27:36] <wkmanire> ajpiano: That is what I was looking for, thanks.
[09:27:47] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Been a long time. he he
[09:27:53] <wkmanire> Good to see you're still working with jQuery.
[09:27:59] <ajpiano> ale__: it's probably possible, but "how do i make some other code i found do what i what" is pretty much the opposite of a "good support question"
[09:28:09] <ajpiano> wkmanire: heh yeah i'm not going anywhere lol :)
[09:28:15] <ajpiano> wkmanire: you comin to SF conf again?
[09:28:23] <wkmanire> I want to
[09:28:26] <wkmanire> I'm in Brazil right now.
[09:28:29] <wkmanire> I've been here for the last 3 months.
[09:28:32] <ajpiano> dayum
[09:28:34] <ajpiano> what for
[09:28:56] <wkmanire> Fell in love with a local.
[09:28:57] <wkmanire> he he
[09:29:11] <wkmanire> When is the conf?
[09:29:20] <rodd> wkmanire really, what city are you in?
[09:29:21] <ajpiano> sf conf is june 28/29
[09:29:29] <ajpiano> wkmanire: but i think we're doing a brazil conf too ;)
[09:29:40] <ajpiano> wkmanire: also, awesome about falling in love with a local :))
[09:29:44] <rodd> I'd like to know more about this conf
[09:29:53] <rodd> I live in São Paulo
[09:29:54] <ajpiano> rodd: http://events.jquery.org
[09:29:59] <rodd> touché
[09:30:06] <wkmanire> Thanks
[09:30:15] <ajpiano> but there's no deets there about the brazil event, it's a bit further off
[09:30:21] <ajpiano> there was a conf though last year in fortaleza
[09:30:21] <ale__> ajpiano: I have this, if($('#mydiv').scrollTop() >= 0.6 * $('#mydiv').height() && !loading && $('#mydiv').height() > 150){
[09:30:31] <wkmanire> Man, I've been wanting to get out to Fortaleza.
[09:30:34] <wkmanire> That would have been a good reason.
[09:30:37] <ale__> ajpiano: but the problem is that it just scroll once
[09:30:39] <rodd> oh I see Fortaleza is too far
[09:30:47] <ajpiano> i don't know if it's gonna be there again
[09:31:44] <ajpiano> ale__: are you debugging the code interactively
[09:31:47] <ajpiano> using your debugger
[09:31:51] <zim> ajpiano: are you part of the core team?
[09:31:52] <ale__> ajpiano: yes
[09:32:23] <ajpiano> zim:  i'm developer relations lead for the project
[09:32:31] <ajpiano> er, the foundation ;)
[09:32:54] <zim> kewl. I owe you a beer or many
[09:33:00] <ajpiano> ale__: so what isn't working about it
[09:33:15] <ajpiano> ale__: the only way for me to figure out what's broken is to *also* be interactively debugging it with my step debugger
[09:33:44] <ajpiano> but that isn't likely cause i'm just putzing around on the comp right now before leaving for mother's day festivities so i would just say
[09:33:58] <ajpiano> to cut down on re-querying the DOM $("#forTheSameElement") multiple times on the same line
[09:34:00] <ale__> ajpiano: that if I have 100 records, on the first time I load 10, then I load another 10 while scrolling, but that's it, it doesn't scroll anymore
[09:34:35] <ajpiano> ale__: do the scroll events continue firing after the new ones are loaded
[09:34:40] <ajpiano> and maybe just the math doesn't work anymore?
[09:34:42] <shoky> ale__, the last few times you posted a jsfiddle of your problem, you got a solution within several seconds
[09:35:06] <wkmanire> ajpiano: That worked like a charm. Thank you. It was for setting up some of the mixed modes for a CodeMirror installation.
[09:35:17] <phpilliterate> can any of you guys please run through my script with me, it doesn't seem to work, and i can't pinpoint why... http://sync.in/ptF5ksHNPU lines 52-56 concern me.. and they are of matter
[09:35:32] <ale__> ajpiano: no, they don't fire anymore!
[09:35:54] <ajpiano> shoky: but it's much more fun to gather round the campfire and tell scary stories of the time that javscript DOMinated my events
[09:35:57] <zim> phpilliterate: what is not working
[09:36:27] <zim> phpilliterate: I also see no jquery there
[09:36:50] <shoky> ajpiano: :) you'll give me nightmares
[09:36:55] <ajpiano> ale__:  well all i can say is "i guess something's broken"
[09:37:00] <ajpiano> brb need to restart irc
[09:37:47] <tomasm-> this is a farfetched question, but is there a way to have a click on an item trigger a function that then loads a click handler, and have the handler fire immediately rather than on successive clicks? i have a function that registeres a click handler based on a class, which normally doesn't cause problems except when the item is loaded dynamically.... maybe i can just change the click event in the code to on(), so it delays and will ca
[09:37:47] <tomasm-> tch dynamically added content too?
[09:38:34] <shoky> or delegate the .on to something that is surely in the DOM ?
[09:39:19] <tomasm-> yeah thats what i mean.... it uses a click() handler now, which wont apply to non existing content
[09:39:31] <zim> tomasm-: what about .on and .addClass
[09:41:45] <tomasm-> the only problem is that the code is "$this.click(function() { ... } ); " which I'm not sure how to convert to $(document).on('click'. ...
[09:42:09] <tomasm-> i'm not sure what to put for the filter, since this is applied on a per literal object basis
[09:42:44] <shoky> $( someElementThatIsInTheDom ).on('click', '.classOfClickableElements', function(e) { ... } )
[09:43:34] <zim> tomasm-: $(document).on('click', '.element', function () {
[09:43:36] <shoky> instead of '.classOfClickableElements'  you can put any selector
[09:43:48] <tomasm-> can I just pass '$this' to the handler? ie $(document).on('click', $this, function ...) ? for whatever reason this code is inside a each() call, I don't think i can generalize it wirth a class name
[09:44:07] <tomasm-> this is a handler that's internal to a bunch of code, not something i call directly
[09:44:28] <shoky> you can $this.addClass   as zim suggested
[09:44:30] <ajpiano> tomasm-: let's back up a little bit
[09:44:35] <shoky> but yeah
[09:44:39] <shoky> ajp in control.
[09:44:48] <ajpiano> tomasm-: you want to load new content on click, and then also have that click get picked up by that new content that is injected
[09:45:01] <tomasm-> ajpiano, yes
[09:45:20] <ajpiano> what's in the click event that's so important it has to be fired immediately upon init like that, some.... initialisation logic?
[09:46:14] <tomasm-> ajpiano, instead of calling <script>$('#link').fancyzoom()</script>, I just want to assign a classname to the a, like a.zoom, and then have one call to it. unfortunately fancyzoom() doesn't actually open the content, it just registeres the click handler that will do it once you click on it.
[09:47:20] <ajpiano> tomasm-: so when the new content comes in, it has fancyzoom "applied' but itdoesn't do anything?
[09:47:23] <tomasm-> the convention is to just do $('a.zoom').fancyzoom(), but that wont work for ajax content loaded later... the code does an internal this.each(), which is unhelpful
[09:47:41] <tomasm-> ajpiano, yes, it doesnt actually open anything, just binds the click handler
[09:47:51] <ajpiano> so have you tried triggering a click?
[09:49:16] <tomasm-> ajpiano, are you suggesting that having a single line with <script>$('a.zoom').fancyzoom()</script> (which internally calls bind('click') ) will somehow work on links that are added after the fact (via ajax)?
[09:49:19] <zim> tomasm-: why use a link to do it? if you want to target an element but keep you script sane use data-element_name
[09:49:48] <tomasm-> zim, it's not my script, it's some 3rd party script, i gotta keep changes to it minimal
[09:49:58] <ajpiano> tomasm-: i'm saying that after you add the new content, you should .find("a.zoom") and do .fancyzoom() and then .trigger("click") on it
[09:50:23] <zim> tomasm-: use .on that will bind to them
[09:51:25] <zim> or listen to ajpiano as he is light yesars ahead of me
[09:51:48] <ajpiano> tomasm-: zim has a point...if you just modify the plugin to do $(document).on("click", providedSelector, fn) insead of this.each(function() $(this).bind("click", fn)) it might work
[09:52:04] <ajpiano> but modifyin the plugin at all is really probably something you don't want to do unless you have to
[09:52:44] <zim> or buzz the plugin dev and ask him to add it OS wins again
[09:56:50] <tomasm-> ajpiano, i'm not sure what sort of selector to choose, since it's already internal to the function/plugin where this.each( this.bind('click') )  is called.... will passing 'this' work, even if it's multiple objects ?
[09:57:27] <zim> ajpiano: I would say that 80% of #jquery chat is about problems with ajax content. is there a way that jquery Vx++ will make this much simpler ?
[09:58:26] <ajpiano> tomasm-: oh right, true dat
[09:58:40] <tomasm-> and instead of "return this.each()", do I need to 'return this' or is that kinda implicit?
[09:58:45] <ajpiano> tomasm-: i would say to try the approach i suggested which essentially amounts to "re-binding" the fancyzoom handler to the new content
[09:58:50] <ajpiano> and then triggering it
[09:59:19] <ajpiano> zim: i don't think so. the idea that jquery can magically address fundamental timing issues that people have grasping a technology with which they're unfamiliar seems untenable to
[09:59:19] <ajpiano> me
[10:00:02] <studio_> jquery vx++ ?
[10:00:16] <ajpiano> "a hypothetical future version of jquery"
[10:00:26] <studio_> ah
[10:00:30] <zim> what about somehow watching for changes i.e. new content?
[10:00:30] <radiantstatic> Any reason why both #logo and #logo-on fade out when hovered? - http://pastebin.com/vXcRYSer
[10:00:44] <ajpiano> zim: that's a prohibitively expensive anti-pattern
[10:00:50] <ajpiano> zim: there are plugins that do that
[10:01:03] <ajpiano> but we aren't going add support for that pattern into core
[10:01:26] <ajpiano> zim: there are also Mutation Observers in the newest chrome and ff
[10:01:41] <ajpiano> so the web platform is catching up with this problem in a way that jquery can't
[10:01:57] <zim> must read up on pattern as have no clue what you just said lol
[10:02:15] <ajpiano> ?w pattern software
[10:02:17] <bot-t> ajpiano, No results found for 'pattern software'.
[10:02:31] <ajpiano> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
[10:02:54] <zim> bot-t is confused as well poor bot :-)
[10:05:56] <tomasm-> honestly, the worst part is i think i actually had this code called within a script segment that I had loading in my ajax code
[10:06:07] <ajpiano> yea
[10:06:13] <ajpiano> that's actually another "anti pattern"
[10:06:36] <zzzrod> Is there any way that I can set my plugin to a 'live' state, that is, enable it to newly added items? short example: $( '.box' ).myPlugin(); that won't trigger for new elements, added by an ajax call
[10:06:39] <ajpiano> embedding a script tag in the remote content and relying on it as the "callback" instead of actuallly providing the callback inside of the executing application
[10:06:46] <ajpiano> zzzrod: in short, no.
[10:06:50] <tomasm-> not my fault other people can't write their code with anticipation of my needs. so i have to improvise
[10:07:13] <ajpiano> zzzrod: you can piggyback on some other plugins like liveQuery or newContent
[10:07:16] <zzzrod> ajpiano so I'd have to re-instantiate my plugin for newly added items?
[10:07:27] <zzzrod> hm will have a look at those, thanks
[10:07:28] <ajpiano> zzzrod: basically, yes
[10:07:30] <ajpiano> ?newContent
[10:07:31] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[10:07:32] <ajpiano> ?liveQuery
[10:07:32] <bot-t> livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation
[10:07:39] <ajpiano> zzzrod: i don't recommend using that though
[10:07:40] <tomasm-> ajpiano, seems pretty reliable, but the other option is to spend endless hours hacking countless plugins to make it work for me
[10:07:58] <zzzrod> ajpiano the plugins?
[10:08:13] <ajpiano> no, the other option is to spend time architecting your app so things load in the order and way that you can expect so you can execute more code at the right time
[10:08:15] <ajpiano> zzzrod: yes
[10:08:35] <ajpiano> zzzrod: re-instantiating the plugin on new content after it arrives is a considerably more robust pattern, imo
[10:09:12] <zzzrod> ajpiano indeed, thanks
[10:10:01] <Junior> yello ;)
[10:10:07] <tomasm-> ajpiano, i just have an onload_once.js and onload.js depending on whether it's the full page or just an ajax segment and whether the content already handles live events, etc
[10:10:45] <ajpiano> tomasm-: sounds retro
[10:10:46] <ajpiano> ;)
[10:10:57] <klawd> hi!
[10:11:09] <klawd> can i make .highlight hilite the text color instead of the background?
[10:11:42] <Junior> i have an issue with the following script -> http://pastebin.com/3C0XpmUz - which works in mozilla (the submit action won't take place) - but in explorer it just ignores. any clues/docs ?
[10:12:04] <tomasm-> klawd, you may need to look for a function that changes the font color instead
[10:12:21] <ajpiano> klawd: are you talking about in CSS or in JS?
[10:12:36] * PhonicUK pokes shoky 
[10:12:58] <ravenzz> Junior what is that? a form?
[10:13:13] <ajpiano> Junior: you should be using the submit event of a form, rather than a click event on the submit event
[10:13:28] <Junior> ravenzz, yes... search form, and i want to prevent users from entering less then 3 chars
[10:13:45] <tomasm-> Junior, if by some possibility you press the enter key on the form rather than clicking on the button, the event will never fire, as per ajpiano's suggestion
[10:13:45] <Junior> ajpiano i'll change to submit now, and see, so thank you
[10:13:49] <klawd> in js
[10:13:51] <ajpiano> Junior: i doubt that's the problem
[10:13:58] <ravenzz> me either
[10:14:02] <ajpiano> but it's a Wrong Thing™ you should fix ;)
[10:14:07] <klawd> all i really want is for the foreground color to change to something and then fade back to original
[10:14:35] <Junior> i'll try first changing and i will let you know
[10:14:36] <ajpiano> klawd: you are using the jquery ui highlight effect?
[10:14:54] <klawd> as of now? yes
[10:15:04] <klawd> but i dont mind building something myself if i have the right tools
[10:15:26] <ajpiano> klawd: i would say to just copy the highlight effect and make a textHighlight effect
[10:15:35] <klawd> aye
[10:15:37] <klawd> thanks
[10:15:39] <ajpiano> could work the same but just does a different property
[10:16:08] <Junior> klawd, ajpiano, changed to submit... the action returns false in mozilla, explorer still has the problem
[10:16:15] <zim> klawd: as far as I know and I may be wrong but highlight works on elements not there content
[10:16:30] <ajpiano> Junior: what is "the problem"
[10:16:40] <ajpiano> Junior: are you debugging this in IE using the IE Developer Tools (F12)
[10:16:59] <ravenzz> d == "search:" also this seems to be a homemade placeholder
[10:17:00] <Junior> ajpiano the form is submitted without the validation ( so i am able to search using 2 characters)
[10:17:30] <ajpiano> ravenzz: good call
[10:17:41] <Junior> ravenzz, it's the default value of the form input
[10:17:48] <ajpiano> Junior: are you doing a standard post or ajax
[10:17:59] <Junior> ajpiano, i don't use ie developer
[10:18:04] <ajpiano> Junior: you should
[10:18:04] <Junior> just wanted to test in ie
[10:18:14] <Junior> ajpiano i don't stand ie...
[10:18:21] <ravenzz> Junior is "search:" one of the expected / possible values for that field?
[10:18:22] <Junior> i am doing post
[10:18:29] <ajpiano> Junior: that is not a mindset that is compatible with the real world
[10:18:41] <Junior> ravenzz "search:" is the default value
[10:18:41] <ajpiano> Junior: if you are testing in IE, then you need to use the dev tools built into IE
[10:18:48] <ajpiano> so you can identify what is going wrong when something breaks
[10:19:11] <Junior> i know... used to do this 4 years ago... when i was "developing"... working as a webdeveloper... now i just want to change somethung
[10:19:20] <klawd> sweet, i got it. thanks guys
[10:19:49] <ajpiano> Junior: you'll find 3rd parties are typically uninterested in this sort of narrative.... you have to use the tools to solve the problem
[10:20:05] <ajpiano> unfortunately i have to go and do mother's day things
[10:20:08] <ajpiano> good luck
[10:20:14] <ajpiano> and press f12 and then "start debugging" in IE
[10:20:16] <Junior> just exposing why i am not using, and that's all
[10:20:36] <Junior> didn't knew that
[10:20:56] <Junior> f12... firebug... same shortcut... that's convinient :)
[10:21:11] <ajpiano> Junior: also i don't know if this is your problem but IE really doesn't like it if you try to insert invalid markup into the DOM, so keep an eye out for that in general
[10:21:40] <studio_> is there anything syntaxically wrong with this object? http://pastebin.com/0vu97JNA
[10:21:41] <Junior> sorry for bothering, didn't knew that... and as i recall... the ie dev was almost impossible to use.....
[10:22:02] <ajpiano> Junior: yes it has improved a lot in ie8 and ie9
[10:22:12] <ajpiano> it's still not as good as firebug or webkit inspector
[10:22:13] <ajpiano> but
[10:22:26] <ajpiano> it's better than what it was
[10:22:27] <Junior> SCRIPT1002: Syntax error
[10:22:31] <Junior> analytics...
[10:22:35] <studio_> ff is saying that .colorbox is not a function, and points to the href:function line
[10:22:37] <Junior> this is somehow stupid :))
[10:23:01] <ravenzz> Syntax error where?
[10:23:20] <Junior> ga.js, line 1 character 1 -> analitycs script
[10:23:28] <ajpiano> hehe see now you are EMPOWERED
[10:23:30] <ajpiano> :)
[10:23:41] <Junior> the most powefull of all :)))
[10:23:55] <Whirl3d> good afternoon. Anybody know of an app or a script that would outline your markup visually--kind of like an outline or sitemap but for your html?
[10:24:56] <Junior> dammed ie.... lots of trouble between ie6 and 7... and as i see ... even with 8/9
[10:25:10] <Junior> just as a reference... should i search for ie6/7 to test on them too?
[10:25:22] <ravenzz> just 7
[10:25:27] <Junior> meaning that i don't know if they are used anymore
[10:25:39] <ajpiano> Junior: the IE dev tools will let you change the browser rendering mode
[10:25:50] <ajpiano> which works for testing like a vast majority of the things
[10:26:10] <ajpiano> but it can only do ie7 ;)
[10:26:27] <Junior> saw the option, so thank you
[10:26:30] <ravenzz> ie8 as well
[10:26:33] <ravenzz> and 9
[10:26:37] <ajpiano> well i meant couldn't do 6 ravenzz ;)
[10:26:41] <Junior> :))
[10:26:43] <ravenzz> ah sure
[10:27:00] <aphid> or you could just do what I do and pretend IE doesn't exist
[10:27:02] <klawd> does jquery have something like mootool's "class"?
[10:27:14] <ajpiano> klawd: no
[10:27:17] <ravenzz> that's good, i mean :p
[10:27:20] <klawd> bleh.
[10:27:38] <liondance> I work with css and xhtml and am trying to figure out how to implement a drop-down menu system for a website.
[10:27:39] <liondance> I am working my way through using my first jquery script in company with hoverintent to make sure menus stay active long enough for users to choose clickable items without frustration of menus folding up too soon.
[10:27:39] <liondance> But, I don't know what to use to create the drop-down menu in the first place! Will I do this with a css list, or javascript?
[10:27:45] <klawd> i gues ill just include a minimal mootools :P
[10:28:14] <ravenzz> liondance you can have a js free drop-down menu btw
[10:28:47] <liondance> ravenezz with css?
[10:28:54] <ravenzz> yes
[10:28:57] <liondance> will it work properly on hover?
[10:29:06] <ravenzz> join #css and write `suckerfish
[10:29:07] <liondance> any suggestions for models?
[10:29:22] <ravenzz> you'll probably need few js to support ieSux
[10:30:43] <beasty> hmm stupid question
[10:30:51] <beasty> i have a string
[10:31:05] <beasty> and when i do var foo = JSON.parse(string);
[10:31:22] <beasty> and then trying to access foo.bar
[10:31:29] <beasty> it returns 'undefined'
[10:31:32] <beasty> any idea ?
[10:31:36] <liondance> There's so much documentation on relative merits of different approaches to using jquery but I don't see much on the basics for totally clueless nubes like me
[10:31:42] <xec> whats the string
[10:31:57] <ajpiano> ?jqf @ liondance
[10:31:58] <bot-t> liondance, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[10:32:09] <liondance> ravenzz that command `suckerfish didn't work. what exactly should I type?
[10:32:12] <beasty> xec: {\"status\":\"ok\"}
[10:32:24] <beasty> a console.log gives {"status":"ok"}
[10:32:24] <liondance> ajpiano: whoa, thank you!!!
[10:32:26] <ajpiano> ?g suckerfish @ liondance
[10:32:28] <bot-t> liondance, Son of Suckerfish Dropdowns | HTML Dog - http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/
[10:32:41] <ajpiano> liondance: we are working in converting that over to being an official jquery resource right now
[10:32:43] <ajpiano> as well
[10:32:46] <xec> beasty: then where would the bar property come from?
[10:33:06] <beasty> xec: from a $.get()
[10:33:29] <liondance> ajpiano: it looks like a great resource!
[10:33:49] <sonja> forgive this n00b question, but something's not working with my $.post()
[10:33:49] <liondance> ajpiano: thanks for the suckerfish ref too . .
[10:33:54] <sonja> $.post("users.php", { "action": "delete", "delete_user_id": "8"  });
[10:33:55] <IamTrying> I have two / three divs with same class name. When i call this `oneID = root.find(".myVariableIds").text();` one time, it gives me same value in one with many times such as value should be 20 but giving "202020202020"
[10:34:02] <sonja> is my syntax at least correct?
[10:34:05] <IamTrying> How to make it stop after once 20?
[10:34:11] <ravenzz> liondance this one http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/
[10:34:21] <beasty> sonja: yes
[10:34:44] <liondance> ravenzz - got it. Thanks!
[10:34:48] <ravenzz> yw
[10:35:09] <sonja> and the idea is that $_REQUEST['action'] will exist with a value of "delete" ?
[10:35:14] <sonja> inside php
[10:35:34] <liondance> I can get something to work while I'm wading through the jquery tutorial. Excellent. Enjoy your day, people!
[10:35:50] <beasty> IamTrying: what are you trying to do ?
[10:36:06] <ravenzz> sonja $_POST['action']
[10:36:27] <beasty> ravenzz: no use $_REQUEST[]
[10:36:35] <beasty> then you catch $_GET && $_POST
[10:36:53] <beasty> sonja: have you looked at it with firebug ?
[10:37:04] <ravenzz> you probably don't need any get var
[10:37:04] <beasty> to see that the variable are set properly ?
[10:37:48] <sonja> the $_REQUEST and $_POST arrays are empty
[10:37:55] <IamTrying> beasty, i have two times in one div "<code class="myVariableId myhidden"><?= $r->id; ?></code> "     -  i am calling one time this: `oneID = root.find(".myVariableIds").text();` outputs: 2020 instead of 20 one time.
[10:38:12] <sonja> it does load up the users.php page
[10:38:18] <sonja> but doesn't seem to be passing the variables
[10:39:15] <beasty> brr
[10:39:25] <beasty> IamTrying: don't use <?=  :p
[10:39:28] <beasty> that's nasty
[10:40:17] <ravenzz> sonja try { action : 'foo', delete_user_id : '8' }
[10:40:25] <IamTrying> beasty, my boss and my team is nasty too, they want me to work faster, so i write less
[10:40:31] <IamTrying> to get more
[10:40:37] <beasty> ok
[10:40:39] <beasty> try this
[10:40:52] <beasty> root.find(".myVariableIds:first").text();
[10:41:08] <IamTrying> OK - IC, Thanks a big beasty
[10:41:16] <sonja> ok
[10:41:25] <beasty> np IamTrying
[10:41:40] <beasty> enjoy your sunday :p
[10:42:19] <sonja> i'm posting to the same page i'm on
[10:42:38] <sonja> it does refresh the page but doesn't pick up the variables in $_POST or $_REQUEST
[10:43:25] <Junior> ajpiano, as you have first suggested... "that i should use submit"... changed the code , unfortunally is not dry.. but i have both the "click" and "submit" function added... and now the form doesn't post even in the crappy ie
[10:43:31] <Junior> so thank you all for your time
[10:45:12] <sonja> ravenzz:  http://pastie.org/3906028 when i put an alert() in there, it works
[10:46:01] <beasty> btw
[10:46:06] <beasty> it says 'login.php' ?
[10:46:06] <sonja> so my .click is fine
[10:46:13] <beasty> and not user.php
[10:46:20] <sonja> i just changed it
[10:46:23] <sonja> neither work
[10:46:31] <sonja> it won't post to a different page nor to the current page
[10:46:39] <beasty> sonja: do you have it somewhere online ?
[10:47:26] <sonja> http://pastie.org/3906071
[10:47:28] <sonja> line 45 works
[10:48:00] <sonja> and line 6 works if i do GET and type it manually in the url
[10:48:05] <ravenzz> anyway what is var id = this.id.slice(1).toString(); ?
[10:48:51] <ravenzz> are you testing with that? or just a static value?
[10:49:06] <ravenzz>  and ?
[10:49:07] <ravenzz> :|
[10:49:26] <ravenzz> if ( isset($_POST['action']) && $_POST['action'] == 'delete' )
[10:50:22] <sonja> oh i made progress one sec
[10:56:14] <sonja> yesssss it works now
[10:56:26] <sonja> it had something to do with the variable
[11:12:03] <zzzrod> am I missing something here? http://pastebin.com/h7Jce8d8
[11:12:14] <zzzrod> using newElements as the context doesn't seem to work
[11:15:58] <studio_> how do i specify a name that has [] in it, ie: $('.foo[name=bar[]])
[11:16:10] <alexr2> put it in quotes
[11:16:21] <alexr2> $('.foo[name="bar[]"])
[11:16:30] <studio_> ah simple. thanks!
[11:16:34] <alexr2> err... missed the closing single quote
[11:16:42] <alexr2> but you get what i mean
[11:18:12] <studio_> yep, that got it thanks
[11:18:19] <alexr2> no problem
[11:18:25] <sekyms> anyone here who is fairly versed in music theory that could take a look at something for me?
[11:21:56] <studio_> sekyms: to what grade?
[11:22:08] <sekyms> i might have just found my problem
[11:22:10] <studio_> i got bored around grade 6
[11:22:30] <studio_> glad to have helped ;)
[11:22:35] <sekyms> or not
[11:22:46] <sekyms> there are grades in music theory?
[11:23:34] <studio_> yeah, 1-8
[11:23:40] <studio_> same as ain performance
[11:24:16] <studio_> gcse is around 4-5, a'level around 6
[11:24:26] <mehrdadii> ravenzz
[11:24:29] <mehrdadii> :)
[11:24:36] <sekyms> I was a music education major in the states studio_ never heard of such a thing
[11:24:46] <studio_> sekyms: paste the url
[11:25:05] <sekyms> if i can't figure it out in the next 1 minutes I will
[11:25:27] <studio_> sekyms: royal associated board of music: http://www.abrsm.org/en/exams/gradedmusicexams/gradedtheory/
[11:25:32] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: I have managed to edit the code you gave me
[11:26:04] <sekyms> i used to be able to do all the way through 8
[11:26:17] <ZachBeta> having a lot of trouble reworking the jquery-file-upload to submit extra form data, anyone else deal with that problem?
[11:26:37] <studio_> time's up sekyms!
[11:26:42] <sekyms> lol
[11:27:16] <sekyms> studio_: the issue its going to take me 30 minutes to explain to you what I'm doing lol
[11:27:25] <studio_> so get started
[11:27:53] <mehrdadii> here is the modified versions:  http://pastebin.com/V5MFtCHz    and   http://pastebin.com/5LRKmHp6
[11:28:21] <sekyms> just fixed it studio_ ;
[11:28:23] <sekyms> ;)
[11:28:25] <ravenzz> mehrdadii hey
[11:28:36] <Lyfesaver> Xec u around?
[11:28:39] <mehrdadii> hey ravenzz
[11:28:46] <mehrdadii> the code should be fine now
[11:28:53] <mehrdadii> but it doesnt run the shortcode
[11:28:55] <mehrdadii> dont know why
[11:29:01] <ravenzz> ah nice :D
[11:29:03] <mehrdadii> I made alot of changes to it
[11:29:12] <mehrdadii> so it can pass the nounce
[11:29:17] <mehrdadii> :)
[11:29:21] <mehrdadii> which it is now
[11:29:41] <mehrdadii> any guess
[11:29:43] <mehrdadii> !?
[11:29:53] <sekyms> it was a +1 error studio_
[11:29:58] * sekyms smacks forehead
[11:30:17] <ravenzz> maybe the plugin doesn't create the shortcode with the add_shortcode wp function
[11:30:42] <mehrdadii> how can I figure that out
[11:31:05] <studio_> +1 error sekyms ?
[11:31:11] <sekyms> off by 1
[11:31:16] <studio_> ah
[11:31:34] <studio_> like for (i = 0; i < $somelimit; i++) instead of <= ?
[11:32:01] <sekyms> yeah
[11:34:20] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: it does uses add_shortcode
[11:34:30] <ravenzz> yes I was looking at the code now
[11:34:38] <shoky> im versed in music theory if somoene still needs help with something
[11:34:42] <ravenzz> so what do_shortcode() returns?
[11:35:47] <Lyfesaver> hey guys... I am used to using PHP mailers.... but i am trying to go PHPless with this site. Is there a JS alternative to a PHP mailer? if so, anyone got any good suggestions on which is best?
[11:36:09] <RET> i created a plugin like described under http://www.debuggable.com/posts/how-to-write-jquery-plugins:4f72ab2e-7310-4a74-817a-0a04cbdd56cb , externalized in a single js file. if i call the function on any element it tells me the func does not exist
[11:36:37] <RET> i include the jsfile, see it in firebug that it gets loaded. so what could be wrong?
[11:36:54] <shoky> RET: how are we supposed to know?
[11:37:02] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: not sure how I can find that
[11:37:08] <mehrdadii> but in the screen I get nothing
[11:37:41] <ravenzz> console.debug(data); in your ajax callback ?
[11:38:04] <ravenzz> Is the ajax request working ?
[11:38:09] <Lyfesaver> hey shoky, wanted to say thx again to you, xec and tw2113 =) I have decided to go with JSON/AJAX, but after doing some reading  on AJAX, I relaized it will take me a few days maybe a week to know enough to do it right
[11:38:19] <Lyfesaver> so i just slapped a band-aid on it for now =)
[11:38:47] <tw2113> shit shit...i'm starting to be a little influential in here
[11:38:54] <Lyfesaver> lol
[11:39:11] <shoky> Lyfesaver oks, i bet the band-aid is already starting to peel off ;P
[11:39:18] <Lyfesaver> LOL
[11:39:30] * tw2113 stops poking int Lyfesaver's bandaid
[11:39:32] <tw2113> sorry
[11:39:35] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:40:07] <tw2113> is it a plain bandaid? or does it have cool designs on it?
[11:40:18] <shoky> water resistant
[11:40:33] <shoky> e0ppppdefio
[11:40:36] <Lyfesaver> water resistant with pics of porn stars
[11:40:38] <shoky> sry
[11:41:02] <mehrdadii> ravenzz: <div class="short-table "></div>
[11:41:10] <Lyfesaver> does it meananything that all they had was guy porn stars?
[11:41:15] <Lyfesaver> lol
[11:43:18] <ravenzz> mehrdadii is the shortcode correct?
[11:43:39] <mehrdadii> it should be [table id=1111 /]
[11:43:55] <ravenzz> maybe you need to quote the id
[11:44:10] <ravenzz> [table id="1111" /]
[11:44:22] <mehrdadii> nope
[11:44:24] <mehrdadii> [table id=1111 /]
[11:44:26] <ravenzz> ok but
[11:44:44] <ravenzz> is that a valid id ?
[11:45:09] <ravenzz> my dinner is ready :o I have to go bbl
[11:45:10] <mehrdadii> yes
[11:45:28] <mehrdadii> wait
[11:45:38] <mehrdadii> I guess I found the problem
[11:45:40] <mehrdadii> echo do_shortcode('[table id="' . $id . '" /]');
[11:45:45] <mehrdadii> this the code I am using atm
[11:45:52] <ravenzz> ok
[11:45:54] <mehrdadii> I have to remove the "" I guess
[11:45:57] <mehrdadii> right
[11:45:58] <ravenzz> get rid of the double quotes then
[11:46:00] <ravenzz> try that
[11:46:02] <mehrdadii> cool
[11:46:17] <tw2113> totally the wrong room for that part of the overall issue
[11:46:36] <tw2113> granted there is css/html/jquery questions that come up in #wordpress too
[11:46:38] <ravenzz> the whole issue is out of topic
[11:47:26] <zzzrod> any idea why this selector is being ignored (line 4)? http://pastebin.com/h7Jce8d8
[11:47:34] <mehrdadii> same output <div class="short-table "></div> ravenzz
[11:55:25] <jaseemabid> How can check if jQuery is loaded in a page?
[11:55:59] <systemfault> if (window.jQuery) ?
[11:56:18] <tw2113> i usually do something basic like use jquery to change text color or something
[11:56:45] <jaseemabid> I dont want it to work if somebody set jQuery = "foo"
[11:57:01] <systemfault> Lulz.
[11:57:06] <systemfault> Why would anyone do that?
[11:57:37] <jaseemabid> is there any special property in the library to check if jQuery is absolutely jQuery ?
[11:57:57] <tw2113> in terms of the $ ?
[11:58:03] <jaseemabid> @systemfault This is a very crazy world. People can do anything :P
[11:58:22] <jaseemabid> @tw2113 let it be $ or jQuery. doesnt matter
[11:58:24] <systemfault> jaseemabid: But you look like an idiot asking that.
[11:58:43] <systemfault> jaseemabid: No matter what you check.. someone could "fake it"
[11:58:56] <systemfault> Javascript is like that.
[11:59:02] <tw2113> i think once someone else is using it, it's out of your hands anyway
[11:59:19] <tw2113> at least in terms of a distributed plugin
[12:00:02] <jaseemabid> @systemfault why? Forget faking. I want to ignore accidental variable setting. Is ther something like $.name === "jQuery" ?
[12:00:26] <jaseemabid> or  jQuery.name === "jQuery" ?
[12:00:33] <tw2113> anyone that dedicating to faking will be able to get around your testing
[12:01:08] <jaseemabid>  Forget faking. I want to ignore accidental variable initialization
[12:01:45] <tw2113> what are the odds of anyone happening to initialize var jQuery = 'foobar'
[12:03:37] <dabear> tw2113: $.fn.jquery gives you the version
[12:03:41] <jaseemabid> @tw2113 Unfortunately a moron did that and my site broke down adding his code. So i was thinking of making sure that my jQ is jQ *indeed*
[12:04:12] <systemfault>  jaseemabid: What would you do if it's not the case?
[12:05:13] <systemfault> jaseemabid: Add an extra check with the version string
[12:05:24] <jaseemabid> Hmm, yeah that should be enough. By the way just tested that on jquery.com to see that the version used is "1.4.2". why not upgrade?
[12:05:39] <systemfault> if (window.jQuery && window.jQuery.fn.jquery === "1.7.2")
[12:06:09] <jaseemabid> Current Release: v1.7.2
[12:06:15] <tw2113> jaseemabid easier to get rid of the moron
[12:06:20] <shoky> except that'd break if window.jQuery === 'foobar'
[12:07:02] <jaseemabid> @tw2113 True!
[12:07:25] <xenaxon> hi
[12:07:28] <jaseemabid>  if (window.jQuery && window.jQuery.fn.jquery === "1.7.2") should be good enough for now I guess.
[12:07:36] <xenaxon> how do they put the search button inside the input text field
[12:07:56] <xenaxon> I want to place a magnifying glass as a button, and make it appear on the right-side inside the search input
[12:08:00] <xenaxon> how can I do that?
[12:08:34] <tw2113> css and absolute positioning xenaxon
[12:08:38] <systemfault> xenaxon: What you see might be different than what is actually is.
[12:08:40] <jaseemabid> xenaxon : css position the image?
[12:09:06] <systemfault> Pretty much that, yes.
[12:09:53] <jaseemabid> `position : relative; left : -20px;` or something like that will move the img a bit to left, making it look like its *in the field*
[12:12:00] <systemfault> He might want to use position absolute instead… playing with position relative + left/top is a good recipe for problems.
[12:13:37] <jaseemabid> systemfault : Thats upto him. Depends on the rest f the code. Seems like he got what he wanted already
[13:13:35] <daum> does anyone know of a browser plugin that lets you write a javascript script (using jquery) to manipulate the currnet page and any resulting pages from the script?  Basically trying to setup a scraper that will submit all the different variations of this form and then scrape the resulting data
[13:19:46] <Whirl3d> greasemonkey
[13:20:03] <_ramok> hi
[13:20:14] <_ramok> how can i load just html to an iframe via jquery?
[13:22:13] <systemfault> $('#myIframe').contents().html('LOL'); IIRC
[13:23:14] <_ramok> systemfault: does that size the iframe vertically automatically?
[13:23:28] <systemfault> What?
[13:24:05] <systemfault> Iframes are like "blackboxes" to a page…
[13:24:13] <_ramok> systemfault: i mean, if the content that should be displayed is 400 px height, will that iframe be scaled to 400px or will i have a scrollbar than?
[13:24:41] <systemfault> _ramok: You need to size it from the parent.
[13:25:46] <_ramok> systemfault: what does that mean?
[13:26:04] <_ramok> systemfault: my issue is, that i want to display html emails....
[13:27:56] <rapha> I'm trying to bind .click() to a couple of links (<a href="...") but that always leads to the browser changing the URL after executing the javascript ... what would be the "right" way to do this?
[13:29:01] <systemfault> rapha: .on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault();  morecodehere });
[13:29:27] <_ramok> systemfault: do you have an idea?
[13:29:38] <systemfault> _ramok: Nope, do a test.
[13:30:08] <_ramok> systemfault: i would not know what to test
[13:30:30] <sekyms> fuck yeah
[13:30:35] <systemfault> _ramok: You asked how to add content to an iframe… and I told you.
[13:30:40] <sekyms> ajpiano: finally got the bitch writing scales
[13:30:59] <rapha> systemfault: thanks, works like a charm now! :-)
[13:38:35] <bil> It's been a LONG time since I been on IRC. What are some other web design/dev channels?
[13:40:14] <zzzrod> bil: /list
[13:43:40] <bil> are all ones for any given language pretty much public?
[13:44:12] <denom> bil, some frameworks require your account to be identified with nickserv, but most are public
[13:44:41] <denom> should say, some channels require your account to be identified with nickserv
[13:45:40] <bil> cool thanks sirs
[13:46:13] <sekyms> and some channels are friendlier than others
[13:46:15] <_ramok> systemfault: that's somehow not working... i have html content there with inline css, and i'm getting errors, for example: missing ) after argument list...olor:rgb(255,255,255);">Ã¤</span><span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:ar...
[13:46:59] <systemfault> _ramok: Weird.
[13:48:08] <_ramok> what could i do?
[13:48:59] <tw2113> find where you're missing a )
[13:50:22] <_ramok> tw2113: i would like to add html emails into an iframe.... i don't have any influence in the html
[13:52:01] <tw2113> do you have any influence on the part that is throwing errors?
[13:53:05] <beasty> mm this stays pretty weird
[13:53:11] <_ramok> tw2113: i've just added the following <script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function() {	$('#mail_content_body_iframe').contents().html({{ mail.mailContent.body|raw|purify}});});</script>
[13:53:38] <beasty> i'm doing: var resp = unescape(JSON.parse(data)); console.log(resp); console.log(resp.state);
[13:54:01] <beasty> and that return this: {"state":"ok"} && undefined
[13:56:16] <tw2113> _ramok and you're sure all your brackets are matched?
[13:56:29] <_ramok> i'll have a look again
[13:56:54] <_ramok> tw2113: yeah, all correct
[13:56:58] <tw2113> just making sure
[14:04:41] <PhonicUK> <3 my string.format for javascript :D
[14:05:04] <PhonicUK> var text = "Hello {0}!".format("Joe Bloggs");
[14:17:48] <Whirl3d> any fancy schamtzy way of ensuring an either-or css class assignment? I know that sounds weird, but I mean like this: You can never have "hidden" and "active" on the same element for example: is there an easy way to enforce that policy or do I just have to addClass("active").removeClass("hidden")||addClass("hidden".removeClass("active")...and is there a way to do it for multiple items--enforce
[14:17:48] <Whirl3d> only one item has a class?
[14:20:32] <bil> whirl3d: i'd just set the default state one way or another and use toggleClass() if you can
[14:21:25] <Whirl3d> bil, thanks for the reply. I have always avoided toggleClass cause I was afraid that it was a shortcut that came with a bunch of overhead. But maybe that will work. I'll try it. thanks.
[14:23:04] <bil> perhaps in some extreme cases but for most ui manipulation it works beautifully
[14:23:24] <ArtificialEX> how can I load an url into an iframe
[14:23:48] <bil> also checkout toggle() if you want to do more along with just adding and removing the class
[14:23:50] <systemfault> ArtificialEX: Set its src?
[14:24:52] <ArtificialEX> system fault i dont know
[14:25:01] <ArtificialEX> i guess i should have the iframe hidden in the html, and let jquery load() it?
[14:25:21] <ArtificialEX> no i need to create a new iframe, set src, and load
[14:26:36] <ArtificialEX> im sorry, i dont need an iframe, just a new frame
[14:27:16] <tw2113> this room sees a lot of people using frames doesn't it
[14:28:47] <ArtificialEX> well my frame was just pop up blocked, so maybe thats not a good idea
[14:29:35] <ArtificialEX> i need to duplicate vanilla forum's login function on my login script
[14:29:40] <Dr-Bombay> never quite understood the hostility to framesets
[14:29:44] <ArtificialEX> in the dom theirs looks like this: <a class="PopupWindow ConnectLink" popupheight="300" popupwidth="600" href="
[14:30:07] <ArtificialEX> theirs isnt pop-up blocked...
[14:30:26] <Dr-Bombay> framesets, at the time, seemed like one of netscape's few good ideas
[14:31:17] <Dr-Bombay> as opposed to <blink> and <font> and automatic semicolon insertion
[14:31:54] <ArtificialEX> further investigation shows their link class has this:
[14:31:55] <ArtificialEX> $(".PopupWindow").live('click', function() {       var $this = $(this);
[14:33:50] <ArtificialEX> im not sure how to do what im trying to do
[14:35:49] <tw2113> maybe someone can suggest a better path once you describe to everyone what you're trying to do
[14:36:51] <ArtificialEX> ok
[14:37:14] <ArtificialEX> vanilla forums has a login url which I need to execute when a user logs into my website
[14:37:17] <PhonicUK> bleh, .droppable is buggy
[14:37:20] <ArtificialEX> this simultaneously logs them into my forums
[14:37:55] <ArtificialEX> so on.click login, I need to open their login url in an iframe, close it, and redirect _parent to a page i want
[14:38:30] <ArtificialEX> their login url is just a page with a loading spinner that closes after its loaded
[14:38:44] <ArtificialEX> is there such thing as an 'in-page pop-up'
[14:42:08] <shoky> a div?
[14:47:09] * ekkis bows in greeting
[14:47:13] <phellarv> Question: If I have a variable containing a html fragment, what is the way to get jquery to parse the html?
[14:48:47] <ekkis> is there any way I could trap a call $('#x').MethodThatDoesntExist() so that I can implement some logic of my own? a sort of auto-vivification of methods in jQuery?
[14:50:02] <phellarv> The fragment looks a bit like this: '<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="a" data-content-theme="d" data-collapsed="false" id="message" class="ui-collapsible"><h3>Foo</h3<p>bar</p></div>'
[14:50:28] <sekyms> ArtificialEX: a modal dialog
[14:52:05] <phellarv> ANyone?
[14:54:04] <jcontra> phellarv: a regex?
[14:54:19] <jcontra> phellarv: what are you trying to parse out of it?
[14:55:07] <ekkis> phellarv: $('<html>myhtml</html>')
[14:55:46] <ekkis> so you can take your whole html and then access it as usual e.g. $x.data("collapsed") should yield false
[14:55:46] <phellarv> ekkis: I'm not sure if I follow you?
[14:56:19] <ekkis> maybe I misunderstood.  I gather you have a variable with a bunch of text that contains HTML and you want to parse and access elements in it?
[14:56:58] <PhonicUK> phellarv, $("#container").append($("A BUNCH OF HTML GOES HERE"));
[14:56:59] <phellarv> ekkis: I want to get jquery to add the stuff it does when a page loads.
[14:57:38] <ekkis> then do as PhonicUK suggested
[14:57:56] <ekkis> but the question you originally asked was how to parse HTML
[14:58:27] <phellarv> Hmm - I believe I tried a similar approach very late last night, but I was so tired, I might have borked it. Re-trying now.
[15:00:42] <Gorkyman_> hm.. interesting... if I do prependTo and add 2 <tr> to <tbody> one gets at the bottom and one at the top
[15:04:06] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Nope - Did not work.
[15:04:13] <PhonicUK> then you've done something wrong :P
[15:05:34] <PhonicUK> heres an example : http://jsfiddle.net/EnPHG/
[15:06:05] <shoky> no need for the extra $()  http://jsfiddle.net/EnPHG/1/
[15:06:19] <PhonicUK> indeed
[15:06:33] <PhonicUK> i do it out of habbit because I'm usually altering it before appending it
[15:09:30] <phellarv> PhonicUK: But jquery do put all kinds of stuff into the html code when it loads. And that "stuff" is what I want inserted into my HTML.
[15:09:55] <PhonicUK> no it doesn't?
[15:10:06] <PhonicUK> jquery doesn't touch the HTML until you tell it to
[15:10:19] <shoky> ekkis: there's no autovivification in javascript/jquery
[15:10:47] <ekkis> shoky: hmm... I was about to write the question in stackoverflow...
[15:11:13] <PhonicUK> shoky, he could catch .error() ?
[15:11:14] <phellarv> Hmmm - There is something I'm missing here - I'm doing a project in Jquery Mobile + phoneGap
[15:11:22] <PhonicUK> and if the error is a undefined method then he can handle it
[15:11:42] <shoky> PhonicUK: sure but that'd get very messy
[15:11:43] <ekkis> shoky: is there a way to catch exceptions thrown for analysis without having a try/catch structure?
[15:11:57] <shoky> ekkis: catching exceptions is the way to catch them.
[15:12:11] <PhonicUK> btw anyone know if .error() will tell me line numbers and files for trapped errors?
[15:12:18] <ekkis> LoL - yes, but without a try?
[15:12:43] <shoky> what .error() are you talking about
[15:13:34] <ekkis> well... I don't know what error is issued when a method does not exist - but whatever it is, that's what I would need
[15:13:50] <PhonicUK> http://api.jquery.com/error/
[15:13:50] <shoky> what's wrong with try/catch structure..?
[15:14:02] <ekkis> PhonicUK: reading...
[15:14:13] <ekkis> shoky: because then I'd have to have it everywhere
[15:14:18] <PhonicUK> apparently window.onerror will tell you
[15:14:19] <PhonicUK> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/951791/javascript-global-error-handling
[15:14:30] <ekkis> and it wouldn't solve the problem I have... I need something that works behind the scenes
[15:15:14] <ekkis> PhonicUK: interesting...
[15:15:41] <PhonicUK> that one is useful for something I'm doing so I'm gonna have a play with that
[15:17:02] <ekkis> PhonicUK: for me, the handler will be to look at the object the method was invoked upon, see if it has a specific property, and if so, attempt an invocation of the method from that object
[15:17:49] <PhonicUK> :)
[15:17:53] <ekkis> this will allow me to $('.someclass').MyInit(); and subsequently be able to do $('#x.someclass').MyMethod()
[15:19:04] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Aaah - Found it - It's phoneGap which parses the document, and adds styles and classes and lots of other "stuff".
[15:19:28] <shoky> ekkis: donno if you can find the object the method was invoked upon, in the error handler..
[15:19:50] <ekkis> that would kill my solution
[15:20:58] <Gorkyman_> is there a way to stop page jumping to top on a href="#" that would work outside of inline onClick="return false;"?
[15:21:11] <Gorkyman_> and it needs to work on dynamically inserted links also
[15:21:44] <shoky> a non-inline click handler?
[15:22:00] <Jon47> Gorkyman_: bind a handler to the click event, call "event.preventDefault()"
[15:22:26] <Jon47> delegate it to an element that will contain all your dynamically inserted links
[15:23:26] <ekkis> shoky: I thnk you're right... I may be screwed
[15:23:43] <shoky> not screwed. just write javascript, not perl :P
[15:24:08] <Gorkyman_> Jon47: yeah this will work, thanks
[15:24:16] <Jon47> $('#thing_that_exists_and_will_be_a_parent_to_all_your_links_past_present_and_future').on('click', '.class-that-identifies-your-links', function(e){ e.preventDefault() });
[15:24:21] <Jon47> Gorkyman_: ^
[15:24:33] <Gorkyman_> yeah, just did that :) thanks
[15:24:37] <Jon47> sick :)
[15:25:51] <amh345> im trying to duplicate a div and maintain form values within that div on a mouse click event.  if i use  $(content).clone().prependTo('form')  it does the duplication but resets all my form values.    if i dont use clone() it maintains values but removes the 'content' from it's original location.    is there a way to clone() but retain the values in the original ?
[15:28:34] <Whirl3d> can you namespace event handlers using .on? Like $(".buttonGroup").on("click.test", function (e) {     so that later you can easily unbind them?
[15:29:06] <shoky> Whirl3d of course
[15:29:20] <shoky> very much recommended
[15:30:02] <shoky> later you can even do .off('.test')
[15:30:24] <amh345> does anyone have any advice how to accomplish my above question?
[15:30:39] <shoky> amh345 can you jsfiddle it
[15:30:47] <amh345> sure
[15:35:15] <juha_> "friends are like potatoes, when you eat them, they die"
[15:36:01] <PhonicUK> false - potatoes are not technically alive to start off with
[15:36:49] <vlad27aug> anything than can spawn life is alive...so technically the potato IS alive
[15:37:32] <PhonicUK> only in the same way that an egg is alive
[15:37:40] <shoky> amh345 i gotta go for a bit but you can take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/6mH9y/2/
[15:37:42] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Are you sure JQuery Mobile does not do any formatting on load?
[15:37:53] <PhonicUK> phellarv, yup
[15:38:03] <amh345> oh ok shoky,  i almost have the gist.
[15:38:09] <amh345> err jsfiddle
[15:38:30] <shoky> mm ok
[15:38:58] <amh345> i just checked your. it works.  is .removeAttr('id') the trick?
[15:39:06] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Argh - I have been wrapping my head around this problem for several days now, and I cannot find what is formatting my HTML (Disregard my finding about phoneGap).
[15:39:09] <shoky> it is no trick
[15:39:24] <amh345> be cause this http://jsfiddle.net/f4gu4/   doesnt work
[15:39:29] <shoky> otherwise there'd be more than one div with that same id
[15:39:38] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Something is adding spans and classes everywhere.
[15:40:10] <PhonicUK> phellarv, google the names of the classes and see what comes up?
[15:40:59] <ekkis> shoky, PhonicUK: well, FWIW: http://goo.gl/BYGAR
[15:45:02] <phellarv> PhonicUK: And the answere is JQuery do stuff to the HTML. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7857218/jquery-mobile-dynamically-change-the-text-of-the-header-of-a-collapsible-div
[15:46:04] <shoky> amh345: weird :)
[15:46:08] <PhonicUK> thats only when you're adding things like collapsible
[15:46:38] <amh345> ugh. i cant get my js fiddle to work like in my real code.
[15:46:40] <PhonicUK> it doesn't change arbritary HTML unless you tell it to or use a plugin that does
[15:47:44] <phellarv> PhonicUK: Well - anyways - googling the classes gave me a solution, so thanks for that.
[15:47:51] <PhonicUK> np
[15:47:51] <phellarv> tip
[15:51:11] <amh345> ok, here is the code. http://jsfiddle.net/f4gu4/1/
[15:51:29] <amh345> if the js comment is toggled you can see what happens.
[15:51:54] <amh345> i'd like to retain the values like when i omit .clone() but also keep the original from moving.
[15:52:05] <amh345> shoky ^
[15:52:43] <amh345> $(content).prependTo('.new_div');  does the trick. only it doesnt keep a copy in it's original spot.
[16:07:04] <felipe_Brz> why do I have to use attr() rather than prop() to fetch a custom html attribute i've set?
[16:09:12] <LSshock> Hi everyone, anyone know how to store and restore a Sortable list (jquery UI)?
[16:11:47] <LSshock> i can get it to serialize but then how to restore
[16:12:53] <Whirl3d> I have an anchor element that contains an image element that I am using as a "template"....whereby I cache the image src attribute of the image and replace it so I can swap put it back on load error.. What is the easiest way to revent the load handler from firing a second time when I put the original url back in?
[16:13:21] <Whirl3d> prevent*
[16:14:03] <Whirl3d> ?.one
[16:14:04] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[16:14:29] <ekkis> Whirl3d: maybe keep a semaphore and have the handler check it?
[16:14:53] <Whirl3d> ekkis, what is a semaphore? Thanks for the reply, btw
[16:15:31] <ekkis> Whirl3d: just a flag that you've stored somewhere (probably in the object itself) that keeps state
[16:15:44] <ekkis> says, "this is my second run"
[16:16:09] <ekkis> it won't prevent the handler from firing but it will prevent it from doing twice the work
[16:16:31] <Whirl3d> I think I am going to create a new unattached image to load the new src into and then on success, replace the "template" src---but do nothing if it errors. Then the handler will only fire on the unattached element...
[16:16:45] <Whirl3d> cool. I do that for my load handler any ways...
[16:16:52] <ekkis> right
[16:17:30] <Whirl3d> I remove a class from the loading element to indicate that the load handler has already handled the load event
[16:18:25] <shoky> h
[16:18:57] <sayd> how would i get previous sibling using selectors? or would i have to use .prev()
[16:19:19] <shoky> amh345: i don't really know the reason why clone() doesnt copy the select value
[16:19:41] <shoky> maybe its time to get familiar with clone
[16:21:05] <ekkis> shoky: cloning is difficult, especially when you want a deep clone
[16:21:20] <ekkis> sayd: I think there's a :prev
[16:22:01] * ekkis shakes head...
[16:22:11] <ekkis> no, I remember seeing something like that but I guess there isn't
[16:24:24] <sayd> not a prob to just use .prev
[16:24:50] <sayd> although im doing a .prev().click() and it feels hacktastic
[16:25:28] <ekkis> I just have a recollection of having found an alternative but it's been a while
[16:27:53] <shoky> ekkis: sure, but it's just odd that select's value isn't cloned while a checkbox checked value or text input's value is cloned
[16:28:15] <shoky> anyway it just calls .cloneNode(true)  if available
[16:28:26] <shoky> which is where the 'fault' lies
[16:28:41] <krater> Hi, how can i access cross domain? look http://jsbin.com/ozibug/edit#preview
[16:30:25] <krater> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.imdbapi.com/?i=&t=point+break. Origin http://jsbin.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[16:30:41] <krater> i'm usign getJSON, how can i fix this?
[16:31:38] <shoky> krater: use JSONP
[16:32:03] <sayd> krater: also that response is text/html.. shouldnt it be application/json?
[16:32:37] <krater> sayd yes, look http://www.imdbapi.com/?i=&t=Point+Break
[16:33:14] <sayd> yeah open web inspector- response type
[16:33:16] <krater> shoky can i use with getJSON or only with ajax?
[16:33:36] <shoky> krater: i'd use .ajax()
[16:33:47] <krater> ok
[16:33:54] <shoky> but maybe it can be done with getJSON and ajaxStart()  donno
[16:34:16] <shoky> er i mean ajaxSetup
[16:45:06] <Whirl3d> sorry, quick question: I have a div with an image loaded in it with an alpha channel. I set the background color for the image and it shows through perfect. But if I set the background color of the parent element, the image doesn't show at all. any pointers off the top of y'alls heads that I should be aware of when dealing with transparent images?
[16:48:21] <krater> shoky dataType: 'jsonp', jsonp: false .... i'm trying here
[16:50:49] <krater> shoky tnks, worked!
[16:54:19] <xenaxon> how to slide a div to the righ
[16:54:21] <xenaxon> right
[16:55:15] <ale__> Does anyone know how to make an endless auto div scroller? I have this if( ($('#div').height() >= 0.8 * .$('#div').scrollTop()){...autoscroll} but of course, after it scrolled the div height, it will enter always to the if!
[16:55:36] <xenaxon> how to slide a div to the right?
[16:55:50] <xenaxon> like SlideDown, but I want the dive to slide from the right/left
[16:57:52] <ale__> anyone guys?
[16:58:40] * ekkis looks
[16:58:47] <ekkis> LoL
[16:58:54] <ekkis> I struggled with this so much
[17:00:11] <ekkis> ale__: take a look at www.pamelaalexandre.com - if you like what it does, just rip off the code.  In the end it isn't what I wanted it to be but I just could make it work the way I wanted
[17:00:45] <ale__> ekkis: did you need the same as me?
[17:01:05] <ekkis> yes but I had some very specific ideas that in the end didn't pan out
[17:01:16] <ekkis> but if you like what you see, the code isn't too difficult
[17:01:30] <shoky> Whirl3d: fiddle it :P

[17:04:21] <xenaxon> how to slide a div to the right?
[17:04:23] <xenaxon> ?
[17:04:28] <xenaxon> has anyone tried this
[17:04:30] <xenaxon> ?
[17:04:50] <lolhii> http://mgates.me/ <--- Any idea why the carousel isn't sliding? It's skipping right away to the next photo. I'm using Twitter Bootstrap, and I have the transition.js file already. >.<
[17:04:59] <ale__> ekkis: no, do you have another?
[17:05:18] <ekkis> shoky: oh, I just remembered... have you looked at $.extend() as a means of cloning?
[17:05:32] <ekkis> ale__: nope
[17:05:45] <shoky> ekkis: i wasn't the one needing to clone something
[17:05:54] <ekkis> oh
[17:06:30] <shoky> IT WAS YOU!
[17:06:42] <ekkis> no... amh345
[17:06:46] <shoky> true
[17:07:19] <ekkis> amh345: I'd been trying to remember... have you looked at $.extend() as a means of cloning?
[17:07:41] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d asked about cloning the other night i think
[17:08:23] <shoky> yea he had id trouble
[17:08:54] <Dr-Bombay> better than ego trouble
[17:09:02] <shoky> ;)
[17:13:20] <krater> shoky Why when i declare, var x = "bla" in ajax return sucess function and try to access x out i get that is not defined?
[17:15:40] <shoky> variables declared inside a function are only scoped to that function
[17:15:59] <Foxhoundz> >>
[17:16:04] <Foxhoundz> >>()();
[17:16:08] <Foxhoundz> Oh
[17:16:16] <shoky> ho
[17:16:17] <Foxhoundz> no JS interpreter bot in this room
[17:16:29] <shoky> ?js hi5('shoky','Foxhoundz')

[17:17:09] <Foxhoundz> ha!
[17:17:34] <shoky> u totally invoked it
[17:17:42] <krater> shoky no, like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5935968/use-variable-outside-the-success-function-from-an-ajax-jquery-call
[17:17:49] <krater> tnks
[17:18:11] <shoky> krater: because the .ajax() call is asynchronous
[17:18:16] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ krater
[17:18:17] <bot-t> krater, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:21:50] <xenaxon> how to slide a div to the right?
[17:22:07] <shoky> xenaxon: one way is using jquery ui: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[17:26:01] <krater> shoky tnks man! ;)
[17:26:46] <krater> shoky good diagram
[17:33:56] <amh345> ekkis: amh345: I'd been trying to remember... have you looked at $.extend() as a means of cloning?  <<  i havent ever tried extend()  ill give it a look
[17:34:50] <ekkis> amh345: it supports deep copies and is thoroughly tested
[17:36:09] <amh345> i see. it looks like it's used to create a select list, among other things
[17:37:45] <amh345> this is a pretty big pain in the ass. heh
[17:38:06] <ekkis> amh345: it's used a lot in plugin writing for handling options
[17:38:48] <amh345> extends might be too much (re: complex) for what i need.   the selects are generated server side on my site.  and it's quite fragile.
[17:38:58] <amh345> i think i may need to look at a different approach
[17:39:12] <psyolus> Is there a good way to catch something like HTTP 401 when using jQuery.ajax for jsonp?
[17:39:23] <amh345> perhaphs instead of duplicating i can just put some sort of image it it's place
[17:40:49] <ekkis> psyolus: there are provisions for error handlers in the object
[17:41:14] <psyolus> ekkis: It says "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests." for the error callback.
[17:41:36] <ekkis> oh dear.  I haven't dealt with cross-domain.  sorry
[17:46:23] <psyolus> Is the best thing to just use a timeout system?
[17:50:48] <ekkis> psyolus: have you looked in stackoverflow?
[17:51:10] <psyolus> Old comments on stackoverflow suggest that using timeout is the only method.
[17:51:46] <ekkis> it's a good source of info
[17:51:49] <ekkis> you may be stuck
[17:52:18] <psyolus> Setting the timeout parameter will make call the error callback for any failure and identify it as a timeout.
[17:54:07] <amh345> is there a way to insert a div into the exact spot where a div is removed from?     http://jsfiddle.net/f4gu4/3/
[17:54:48] <amh345> if i click "add me"  the new div is displayed at the bottom instead of the exact location of the previous div
[17:55:49] <ekkis> there is... I'm trying to remember how I've done that...
[17:57:14] <ekkis> amh345: have you looked at: http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/ ?

[18:19:39] <kakogeros> ?

[18:19:58] <kakogeros> http://pastebin.com/NVXNGPLb
[18:20:01] <ekkis> I suppose you can save the element previous to the one you want to replace and after deletion, insertAt()
[18:20:43] <ekkis> it's not insertAt... I can't remember the right name...
[18:20:58] <kakogeros> ekkis talking 2 me man?
[18:21:29] <ekkis> amh345: it's just called .after(), actually
[18:21:40] <ekkis> kakogeros: no, sorry...
[18:21:47] <kakogeros> aha
[18:21:51] <kakogeros> so you cant help?
[18:22:09] <amh345> ekkis: do you mean save the element in a variable?
[18:22:39] <ekkis> yes, then use its .after() method to insert your new element
[18:22:51] <ekkis> kakogeros: I'm looking...
[18:23:32] <tutankamon> hi
[18:23:55] <ekkis> kakogeros: you just have the code in the wrong place.  lines 31-34 belong inside the click handler
[18:24:21] <tutankamon> I am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '_GLOBAL_' of undefined
[18:24:35] <tutankamon> when I make an ajax request that gives an error
[18:24:37] <ekkis> kakogeros: so that the functionality happens when the user clicks, not at the time the handler is getting defined
[18:25:16] <kakogeros> well
[18:25:20] <kakogeros> i've also tried that
[18:25:28] <kakogeros> but didnt work i think
[18:26:46] <kakogeros> you mean .click(funtion(){code},function(){code}) or .click(function(){code and code});?
[18:32:59] <tutankamon> I am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '_GLOBAL_' of undefined
[18:34:38] <shoky> ?paste @ tutankamon
[18:34:39] <bot-t> tutankamon, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:35:32] <tutankamon> it's a simple request
[18:35:43] <tutankamon> I see first an error of a server 500
[18:35:48] <tutankamon> and right after that
[18:35:53] <tutankamon> this is the code
[18:35:53] <tutankamon>             error: function(ajaxRequest) {                 var responseData = $.parseJSON(ajaxRequest.responseText);                 var errors = '';                 for (var err in responseData.errors['_GLOBAL_']) {
[18:35:59] <beancurd> wow.
[18:36:36] <tutankamon> so it seems it can't find that GLOBAL
[18:36:57] <beancurd> O_O
[18:37:00] <shoky> O_O
[18:37:05] <beancurd> don't know if srs.
[18:37:44] <shoky> tutankamon: why would it find it?
[18:38:45] <tutankamon> because the code wants to make me happy?

[18:47:39] <imsky> lol good ol cpanel
[18:48:31] <imsky> sup abjorn
[18:53:25] <tutankamon> shoky: so dude, you gonna tell me how to solve this?
[19:03:01] <shoky> tutankamon: solve what?
[19:03:16] <tutankamon> or at least explain the cause of the error
[19:03:28] <shoky> the error is self explanatory
[19:03:43] <shoky> there is no _GLOBAL_ property in responseData.errors
[19:03:58] <shoky> yet you are trying to access it
[19:05:43] <shoky> also, responseData.errors itself is undefined
[19:14:34] <w32stuxnet> does the jquery selector work with elements fetched with $.ajax?
[19:14:51] <w32stuxnet> I'm having big issues getting jquery-ui droppable to work with elements that I've fetched with $.ajax :/
[19:22:52] <dcope> hello
[19:23:25] <dcope> Is there a way to have a selector select all inputs within a div with a specific class?
[19:23:59] <dcope> I tried div.myClass:input
[19:24:48] <alexr2> div.myclass input
[19:24:50] <alexr2> not :input
[19:27:46] <dcope> alexr2: hm, i still can't get it
[19:27:57] <dcope> << pasting now >>
[19:28:04] <alexr2> jsfiddle please
[19:28:32] <beancurd> don't do it!
[19:28:50] <alexr2> eh?
[19:28:59] <beancurd> i mean. don't <<pasting now>>
[19:29:06] <dcope> beancurd: ?
[19:29:10] <alexr2> haha i hope he wouldn't paste in here
[19:29:16] <alexr2> i've seen people do that... it's actually pretty funny
[19:29:25] <aphid> jsfiddle while jsrome burns
[19:29:26] <dcope> oh, no, i'm doing a proper test case on jsfiddle as requested :)
[19:29:32] <dcope> this is not my first time on the internet :)
[19:29:35] <beancurd> pretty sure that ajax guy did it.
[19:30:35] <dcope> o_O
[19:30:46] <dcope> it works on jsfiddle but not on my website. Time to dig deeper.
[19:30:53] <alexr2> sounds good!
[19:31:23] <Dr-Bombay> w32: got an answer yet?
[19:35:00] <Dr-Bombay> we'll never know
[19:35:12] <dcope> excuse my javascript noobness, but if i'm including jquery.js, do i need to "import" jquery in a separate js file?
[19:35:29] <Dr-Bombay> no
[19:36:01] <Dr-Bombay> it's attached to the window object
[19:36:56] <dcope> hm
[19:37:03] <dcope> can't figure out why this isn't working on my site
[19:41:44] <alexr2> dcope do $('input').remove()
[19:41:51] <alexr2> make sure jquery is at least working where you put it
[19:42:12] <dcope> alexr2: that worked
[19:42:58] <alexr2> increase it to your full selector that you're using
[19:43:04] <alexr2> oh also
[19:43:08] <alexr2> div.myclass
[19:43:18] <dcope> that worked, too
[19:43:26] <alexr2> then it is catching it
[19:44:12] <dcope> alexr2: do i have to bind events in the document ready handler?
[19:44:17] <dcope> putting my bind function in there made it work.
[19:45:17] <alexr2> i would recommend it
[19:45:26] <alexr2> i always put my stuff in a ready function of some sort
[19:46:10] <alexr2> it kind of depends on certain things... where you put your javascript being one of them
[19:46:19] <dcope> ah
[19:46:26] <alexr2> if it's in the header, then yes, you need a document ready
[19:46:33] <alexr2> if it's at the bottom, it's not as big of a deal
[19:46:41] <alexr2> by bottom i mean right before the closing body tag
[19:47:00] <alexr2> because the dom just about loaded at that point
[19:47:55] <dcope> ah, it's always up top
[19:47:58] <dcope> i like to keep it up there
[19:48:08] <alexr2> proper place for js code is actually at the bottom of the page
[19:48:09] <alexr2> just fyi
[19:48:15] <alexr2> css at the top, js at the bottom
[19:50:34] <mda_> I fixed my code-signing problem by (you guessed it), deleting all certs/keys and profiles (xcode iOS) ;-)
[19:50:44] <dcope> mda_: wrong room, #iphonedev
[19:50:45] <mda_> and readding of course
[19:50:53] <mda_> yeah, i'm getting to that,
[19:52:08] <mda_> but I still have this jquery or jquerymobile bug where I click on a list item and it crashes the program (on the device and simulator too)……cpu goes to 100%…..but if I hover-click (tap-hold) then open from the flyout, then the next page opens(!)
[19:52:40] <mda_> (i wondered if it was a simulator bug until i fixed the code-signing)
[19:53:34] <mda_> has anyone else ever had this happen?  it's very frustrating
[19:56:27] <Funksmaname> hey all, i wonder if someone could offer some advice? I'm using the isotope plugin as well as soundmanager 2 - I've got a bunch of playlists that stack with isotope in masonary fashion, but when you click a track to play it the holding box enlarges so i need to trigger a 'reLayout'
[19:56:58] <alexr2> mda_, if you remove the jquery functionality you have that's bound to those links, does it still happen?
[19:57:04] <Funksmaname> I've managed to do that on click, but I think it is being triggered before the size increase as its working but only on a subsequent click (the window is already larger at that point)
[19:59:00] <Funksmaname> anyone know how i can delay the running of .isotope('reLayout') when I click?
[20:05:57] <Funksmaname> anyone?
[20:06:23] <mda_> alexr2: will removing the dialog attributes (and all other jquery attributes) do?  I'll try that …. just a sec
[20:06:56] <alexr2> mda_ it'll help you narrow it down
[20:10:04] <mda_> alexr2: trying without the dialog….then I'll try the UL tag attributes……hrmmm actually, the list is ordered….maybe I should change the UL tag to an OL tag too…maybe that will speed things up in the search bar...
[20:10:34] <mda_> alexr2: first attempt fail :)
[20:12:28] <mda_> alexr2: removing  data-role="listview" data-filter="true" from the UL tag (while removing the markup) fixes the crash
[20:13:41] <alexr2> i mean stop the actual jquery calls
[20:13:52] <alexr2> look at the jquery .bind or .click event that you have
[20:14:01] <alexr2> you probably have an infinite loop in there somewhere
[20:14:18] <mda_> yes, how do I do that?
[20:15:14] <slithytove20061> So what's the status on the now jQuery plugins site?
[20:15:21] <mda_> alexr2: I'm perplexed…I'm haven't written any custom JS, just used the attributes in the list demo
[20:16:20] <alexr2> what list demo are you talking about
[20:17:50] <tw2113> you know..that demo
[20:18:00] <alexr2> no, i don't know
[20:18:03] <alexr2> :-P
[20:18:03] <mda_> alexr2: whoops….jquery mobile….. the attribute causing the problem is data-role="listview" …… I guess I'll try the OL tag….AND the @#jquerymobile channel
[20:18:05] <tw2113> sarcasm
[20:18:13] <alexr2> you need an opening tag tw2113
[20:18:23] <tw2113> meh :D
[20:18:33] <mda_> meh *jinks*
[20:18:33] <coldhead> we all need things
[20:19:03] <alexr2> mda_ the data-role attribute is just a selector
[20:19:37] <mda_> alexr2: all I know is when it's there, I get pretty markup and crash…..without I get ugly but working list
[20:23:05] <alexr2> mda_, you should take a tutorial on jquery :-P and play around with the core functionality a bit before using plugins
[20:23:46] <alexr2> at least until you can understand what adding that attribute does
[20:23:55] <alexr2> (outside of making it pretty and functional)
[20:24:43] <mda_> alexr2: jquery mobile is a plugin?
[20:25:32] <alexr2> not the point :-P
[20:25:33] <mda_> alexr2: ok, I have an idea of what is happening…
[20:26:11] <mda_> if I use the search filter and reduce to a small resultset (say ten), the no crash!   maybe it's hitting some timeout when all 4000 rows are there :-)
[20:26:39] <alexr2> you're binding events to 4000 rows?
[20:26:42] <mda_> like it trys quits half way, then trys again
[20:26:45] <mda_> ya
[20:26:46] <mda_> :)
[20:26:48] <alexr2> ...
[20:26:53] <alexr2> yes... that's a bad idea
[20:26:54] <alexr2> :-P
[20:27:05] <mda_> EYYYYEEE can DOOOO EEEEEET
[20:27:11] <alexr2> ?on@mda_
[20:27:12] <bot-t> mda_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:27:14] <alexr2> look into that
[20:27:36] <mda_> ok
[20:27:42] <alexr2> it won't be all automated
[20:27:46] <alexr2> so you'll have to write your own code
[20:27:51] <alexr2> but it should actually work
[20:27:54] <mda_> that's ok, i can write code
[20:28:25] <mda_> #!/bin/env yes
[20:28:39] <alexr2> 4000 rows is still a lot though, might want to rethink  the way you're doing that
[20:28:42] <alexr2> maybe build in some ajax
[20:28:55] <alexr2> and pagination
[20:29:02] <mda_> you're saying my code is dirty? :)
[20:29:15] <alexr2> naah, just not efficient :-)
[20:29:34] <mda_> ajax better than soap….or borax
[20:30:12] <Dr-Bombay> and is there some reason they just didn't make bind do the cool efficient thing
[20:30:30] <mda_> lol @Dr-Bombay
[20:30:49] * mda_ thanks everyone for the nice free code
[20:31:03] <alexr2> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings
[20:31:06] <alexr2> the bot says so :-P
[20:31:21] <Funksmaname> hey all, i wonder if someone could offer some advice? I'm using the isotope plugin as well as soundmanager 2 - I've got a bunch of playlists that stack with isotope in masonary fashion, but when you click a track to play it the holding box enlarges so i need to trigger a 'reLayout'.
[20:31:25] <Funksmaname> I've managed to do that on click, but I think it is being triggered before the size increase as its working but only on a subsequent click (the window is already larger at that point)
[20:31:31] <Dr-Bombay> alexr: and ed is the standard text editor
[20:31:34] <Funksmaname> anyone know how i can delay the running of .isotope('reLayout') when I click?

[20:41:19] <shoky> do we have to
[20:42:20] <martisj> so i have a table and want to toggle the tbody with the click of a button.
[20:42:32] <martisj> Any good way of doing it?
[20:43:57] <mda_> shoky: no
[20:46:33] <shoky> martisj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kbBbE/
[20:47:04] <martisj> shoky: thanks but i need it to slide up smoothly :)
[20:48:51] <slithytove20061> @martisj: try http://api.jquery.com/
[20:49:18] <martisj> slithytove20061: i am having a look at the slidedown and slideup animations.
[20:49:42] <martisj> i have a wrapping div that i can animate
[20:49:52] <mda_> alexr2: so you're saying that every time I put a data-rel="dialog" attribute in a link it adds a custom handler?!
[20:50:05] <shoky> then why did you say toggle
[20:52:16] <shoky> martisj i dont think its possible to animate table rows/tbody's
[20:52:27] <shoky> with jquery, at least
[20:54:27] <martisj> say i animate height down to 20px and then want to reverse that action. How would i do that?
[20:54:35] <martisj> no height is currently defined for the element.
[20:54:46] <martisj> can i animate the height "out"??
[20:54:49] <martisj> if that makes any sense?
[20:54:54] <slithytove20061> you can still measure and store the height
[20:55:19] <martisj> won't the height be forgotten once the animation has completed?
[20:55:27] <martisj> hang on i'll post a jsfiddle
[20:55:40] <slithytove20061> hence the "store" part in what I said
[21:05:38] <slithytove20061> I know this is a very general question, but what is the best license to use for open source jquery plugins?
[21:05:46] <tw2113> i like wtfpl
[21:06:53] <smplstk> MIT and GPL licenses are among the most popular.
[21:08:11] <slithytove20061> i see jQuery is under both. Do you know why jQuery is still using gpl v2, instead of 3?
[21:12:20] <Whirl3d> hey all. You know what would be a cool extension to jsfiddle? If you could nominate various fiddles for inclusion in a "master library" that once approved (presumably by someone who knew the difference between good and bad coding), could be easily referenced. I notice so many of the same questions day in and day out and I'm always trying to remember which fiddle did what..
[21:15:59] <shoky> Whirl3d he's working on a beta that should include something like that
[21:16:43] <Whirl3d> who's he?
[21:16:48] <shoky> zalun
[21:16:57] <shoky> jsfiddle dude
[21:17:07] <Whirl3d> brilliant. I love jsfiddle.
[21:17:35] <shoky> yep. but i've got a bad feeling about the beta
[21:17:48] <Whirl3d> I do wish there was a better way of saving "temporary fiddles" and distinguishing them from updates or "keepers"
[21:18:05] <shoky> yeap
[21:18:24] <shoky> tho its not hard to bookmark ;p
[21:18:26] <Whirl3d> I would love it if it could incorporate pirate pad
[21:19:25] <ndss56> how long are the fiddles stored?
[21:19:36] <ndss56> time-wise
[21:20:20] <smplstk> caniuse: U SUCK!
[21:24:08] <martisj> how can i reverse this animation: http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/qKwvv/
[21:24:16] <martisj> and remove overflow: hidden:
[21:24:44] <slithytove20061> as I said before, read and store the height before you start the animation
[21:25:35] <mda_> alexr2: trying to work through the example…but not directly applicable….
[21:25:59] <martisj> slithytove20061: hehehehe :D thanks
[21:26:01] <smplstk> ?toggle @ martisj
[21:26:02] <bot-t> martisj, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[21:26:11] <smplstk> ^^
[21:28:38] <martisj> smplstk: thanks :)
[21:28:49] <martisj> multiple handlers?
[21:28:52] <martisj> hmmm
[21:29:09] <LabRaTT> is there any way to view a pdf and zoom to a location using jquery
[21:30:08] <smplstk> martisj: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qKwvv/4/
[21:30:33] <smplstk> the way I'm getting height() is somewhat unreliable.
[21:31:04] <mda_> fail……
[21:31:05] <martisj> smplstk: awesome!
[21:31:06] <mda_>             <script>
[21:31:06] <mda_>               $("#dataList li a").on("click", function(event){
[21:31:06] <mda_>                 alert($(this).text());
[21:31:06] <mda_>               });
[21:31:06] <mda_>             </script>
[21:31:17] <martisj> smplstk: is there a more reliable way of getting the height?
[21:32:00] <smplstk> well - that way is simply unreliable because it assumes ('.information_box') will always be there.
[21:32:05] <mda_> I removed the data-rel="dialog" attribute from the anchors in the LI rows……..maybe the search bar kills it
[21:32:41] <smplstk> martisj: that should be enough for you to play around with at least
[21:33:01] <martisj> smplstk: aha i see! Thanks :D
[21:33:01] <smplstk> you could also simplify with slideToggle()
[21:34:01] <mda_> the search bar doesn't kill it….maybe 4000 rows is just too much…..wth…..the .on() docs were boasting about binding to 1000 rows….
[21:34:56] <tw2113> since i missed it, why are you creating 4000 rows of data?
[21:35:01] <martisj> why not calculate the height of the unit_details?
[21:35:16] <martisj> slideToggle()... I'll have a look
[21:36:13] <mda_> tw2113 that's how many there are darnit :)
[21:36:47] <tw2113> that's wonderful and all, but do they all need to be loaded at the same time?
[21:37:38] <mda_> for the search bar in the filtered list to work….?  the tutorial doesn't cover loading in chunks AFAICS
[21:38:09] <tw2113> it'd be an amendment i'd probably research how to accomplish
[21:38:18] <smplstk> martisj: I guess you can't really use slideToggle, because that button is INSIDE the thing you would be hiding.
[21:38:48] <mda_> tw2113: I'm asking the channel to figure out if there will be diminishing returns on effort
[21:38:53] <slithytove20061> though you could absolutely position it outside
[21:39:05] <martisj> well i am not hiding the button though. but it matters that it isn't outside of the unit_details box?
[21:39:12] <tw2113> what? loading 4000 rows of info at once on a page...nah it'll be cake
[21:39:42] <mda_> tw2113: I tried removing the attribute and adding a script, and it still hangs…..so not sure how to do this…..in jquerymobile
[21:39:44] <martisj> smplstk: why did you use   find() ?  var init_height = udeets.find('.information_box').height();
[21:40:04] <tw2113> you're doing this over mobile?
[21:40:19] <mda_> tw2113: ya I should be in jquerymobile
[21:40:26] <tw2113> ouch
[21:40:48] <slithytove20061> if you have var box = $('#box'); then you do box.find('.inner'); it is the same as doing $('#box .inner'), but faster
[21:40:51] <mda_> they didn't say anything though :)
[21:40:56] <smplstk> martisj: you could just do $('.information_box').height();
[21:41:02] <smplstk> or use a static number?
[21:41:05] * smplstk shrugs
[21:41:06] <martisj> okay
[21:41:22] <martisj> that height might change depending on the content obviously ;D
[21:41:35] <smplstk> ya - that's what I was sayin' before
[21:41:41] <smplstk> about it being somewhat unreliable.
[21:41:53] <slithytove20061> so calculate the height each time the first function is run, rather than only once.
[21:42:45] <slithytove20061> lave var init_height; where it is, but move init_height = udeets.find('.information_box').height(); rigth inside the first function
[21:43:44] <wkmanire> I'm looking at the js-hotkeys plugin but it was written for jquery 1.2.x
[21:43:52] <wkmanire> Should I be worried about it being dated?
[21:44:34] <tw2113> depends on if the functions and methods it uses are obsolete or not
[21:44:48] <tw2113> take it as a challenge to update it for 1.7.x
[21:46:27] <slithytove20061> try it as is. if it works great, if not, track down the problem functions =]
[21:46:48] <wkmanire> It seems to be fairly popular.
[21:47:00] <wkmanire> But 1.2 is practicaly ancient history.
[21:47:15] <tw2113> so you're saying there's possible risk?
[21:47:21] <wkmanire> I'm sure it is full of .bind() or .keydown/up/press
[21:47:22] <wkmanire> etc...
[21:47:32] <tw2113> read the source
[21:47:40] <slithytove20061> asaik, bind still works just fine
[21:47:59] <wkmanire> I was hoping there was something more recent that had replaced this.
[21:48:15] <wkmanire> But I guess not.
[21:48:35] <systemfault> About older plugins.. I'd be more scared about the usages of .attr
[21:48:36] <slithytove20061> depending on what it does, it would probably be fairly trivial to recreate it
[21:48:37] <martisj> smplstk: that fiddle you edited worked wonders :D
[21:48:41] <martisj> smplstk: thanks!!!
[21:48:59] <slithytove20061> based on the name, i am guessing that it binds key presses to functions?
[21:49:11] <smplstk> I just wanted to illustrate the use of toggle is all martisj
[21:49:21] <smplstk> glad I could be of help.
[21:49:56] <wkmanire> more specifically it handles combinations.
[21:50:17] <martisj> smplstk: you sure illustrated that well :)
[21:50:26] <martisj> i am just trying to incorporate it with livequery now
[21:50:43] <wkmanire> https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys
[21:50:48] <wkmanire> he he, I'm sure this is trustworthy.
[21:51:12] <wkmanire> Not sure why google doesn't have this as the top search result.
[21:51:32] <smplstk> wkmanire: last authored 2 years ago :S
[21:51:40] <slithytove20061> probably because it is old. google is getting smart about things like that
[21:51:45] <martisj> does the toggle function automatically return false to the click action for a link?
[21:51:57] <martisj> or do i still have to add return false; at the end?
[21:52:05] <tw2113> i dunno wkmanire, that jeresig guy looks potentially sketchy
[21:52:07] <tw2113> </sarcasm>
[21:52:31] <Dr-Bombay> .toggle returns the query object it's operating on
[21:52:45] <amh345> hi guys, i've been at this for hours and get find a solution.  im afraid it's over my skill level.  i've updated a jsfiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/HT3nu/1/  can anyone have a look at it?   the problem im having is i i need to add some text to the exact location from where the div was moved from.
[21:52:57] <Dr-Bombay> oh, wrong .toggle
[21:53:06] <mda_> tw2113: #jquerymobile is silent…..i think I'll just cut up the table alphabetically……mobile likes to hang
[21:53:18] <Dr-Bombay> well, I think that one does too
[21:55:35] <nights> hi
[21:55:42] <nights> having some problems nesting two ajax calls
[21:55:57] <nights> im using async for the first call, and success with a function bound in both of them
[21:56:11] <nights> however only the first ajax calls executes the success code successfully.
[21:56:22] <nights> isnt it possible to have more than one success in the same context?
[21:57:04] <Whirl3d> amh345, I will add some comments to your fiddle and post the link back here. gimme just a minute
[21:57:18] <amh345> Whirl3d: thank you so much!
[21:57:28] <wkmanire> nights: Multiple-successes are rare, but they do exist.
[21:57:36] <wkmanire> nights: Read about $.Deferred.
[21:57:39] <amh345> some of what's in the fiddle isnt functioning.  the code is rather long. i just tried to get the gist of it in there.
[21:57:56] <wkmanire> nights: Ignore my first statement, it was a horrible joke.
[21:58:43] <nights> wkmanire: i see... well
[21:58:48] <nights> are you interested in looking at the code?
[21:58:53] <nights> its just like 15 lines
[21:59:03] <nights> getting quite desperate :(
[21:59:37] <wkmanire> nights: You can solve this problem by using deferreds. All of the ajax functions return promises.
[22:00:04] <wkmanire> In fact in the $.Deferred documentation on the website, this exact problem you are describing is given as an example.
[22:00:43] <nights> https://gist.github.com/2691855
[22:00:49] <nights> this is my code
[22:01:04] <tw2113> it's so cute nights
[22:01:08] <phper1213> has anyone meet this before: when u submit an data using dialog, when u refresh, strange thing....
[22:01:10] <phper1213> It automatic create a new data  just as u edit ... i don't know why.
[22:01:12] <nights> tw2113: thanks.
[22:01:20] <tw2113> it's all indented in shit +1
[22:01:23] <nights> tw2113: so you know why that second success call doesnt work?
[22:01:25] <tw2113> *n
[22:01:27] <tw2113> not in
[22:01:31] <tw2113> no idea

[22:01:42] <nights> well the STFU
[22:01:43] <nights> who cares.
[22:01:53] <nights> useless piece of trash.
[22:02:06] <tw2113> apparently, i'm not appreciated
[22:02:13] <tw2113> *goes to the corner*
[22:02:15] <nights> 99% of this channel is full of idiots who only know how to (and not even that) indent code
[22:02:48] <tw2113> damn it, forgot my sarcasm tag again
[22:02:52] <tw2113> i always do that
[22:03:10] <Dr-Bombay> this has to be one of the most lurked irc channels ever
[22:03:12] <phper1213> continue test
[22:03:15] <nights> tw2113 commonly you all have a lot of time to just piss people off.
[22:03:19] <systemfault> wtf is that shit code? PHP?
[22:03:26] <systemfault> Lulz.
[22:03:27] <nights> heres another one
[22:03:48] <systemfault> nights: Give us JS and maybe… we won't think that you're a retard...
[22:03:52] <tw2113> you should see #ubuntu Dr-Bombay
[22:03:52] <systemfault> What do you think?
[22:04:40] <systemfault> I think this is one of the friendliest "mainsteam channel" I know.
[22:04:41] <Dr-Bombay> looks about the same
[22:04:41] <nights> systemfault: im not interested in your seemingly useless help anyway.
[22:04:51] <Dr-Bombay> systemfault is not useless
[22:04:57] <Dr-Bombay> even if he does abuse unicode
[22:05:09] <systemfault> … ?
[22:05:11] <systemfault> ;)

[22:06:41] <greedo>  /kick ban
[22:06:49] <wkmanire> Man, I've been spending too much time in #clojure and #python.
[22:06:50] <beancurd> trololol.
[22:06:52] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: His nickname says it all.
[22:06:53] <wkmanire> I forgot what #jquery is like.
[22:07:01] <nights> i havnt!
[22:07:04] <nights> its the same as usual
[22:07:05] <nights> :(
[22:07:08] <beancurd> that's fantastic.
[22:07:10] <beancurd> do it again!
[22:07:11] <nights> ive helped a lot of people here without ever complaining about indentation, php etc.
[22:07:15] <wkmanire> nights: Quit crying.
[22:07:17] <nights> though i dont like people pasting code in the chan.
[22:07:23] <wkmanire> nights: Go read about deferreds and solve your problem.
[22:07:26] <systemfault> wkmanire: I should REALLY try clojure sometimes.
[22:07:29] <wkmanire> nights: We don't get paid to do your work.
[22:07:32] <phper1213> sorry
[22:07:32] <greedo> it's called spamming and yes it's annoying
[22:07:37] <wkmanire> systemfault: Its awesomer-er than its reputation.
[22:07:45] <wkmanire> which is also good.
[22:08:03] <greedo> systemfault: yeah ##C is boat loads of fun from experience
[22:08:09] <systemfault> wkmanire: I was like…. "wtf? there's nothing wrong with clojure's reputation" :P
[22:08:37] <nights> wkmanire: ive seem discussions on stackoverflow with people having nested success declarations running fine...are you saying it will not work this way?
[22:09:31] <phper1213> code is not allowed?
[22:09:43] <smplstk> ?p @ phper1213
[22:09:43] <bot-t> phper1213, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:09:53] <tw2113> pastebin or jsfiddle the code you need looked at
[22:09:56] <smplstk> as in, _not_ in the channel.
[22:09:56] <wkmanire> nights: I'm saying there is a recommended way to solve this problem that works very well in a few lines of code and is outlined in crystal clear text on this web page -> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[22:10:26] <wkmanire> nights: What you are trying to do became so common that the problem was solved directly in the library, but by all means, re-invent the wheel if you feel it is appropriate.
[22:11:27] <nights> wkmanire: no its fine. thanks very much. will have a look at this.
[22:11:32] <systemfault> I love the jQuery promise system… I don't know who implemented it but damn.
[22:11:42] <wkmanire> systemfault: Rebecca Murphey
[22:12:01] <wkmanire> systemfault: At least I think that is what I heard on the yayquery webcast a while ago.
[22:12:06] <systemfault> Wait wait, a woman?
[22:12:09] <systemfault> Nice!
[22:12:18] <coldhead> no, jaubourg did it
[22:12:24] <coldhead> rebecca just specced it out
[22:12:29] <wkmanire> Ah ok
[22:12:40] <coldhead> specced it/stole it from dojo
[22:12:41] <systemfault> Ah… I knew it was too good to be true..
[22:12:54] <coldhead> she could still beat us up any day, systemfault
[22:12:57] <wkmanire> systemfault: She's still a kick ass programmer.
[22:12:58] <coldhead> don't be too disappointed
[22:13:19] <systemfault> coldhead: I'm still looking for a "woman programmer hero"
[22:13:24] <nights> wkmanire: will this also be able to process the data result from two different calls or does it purely work on the success callback ?
[22:13:45] <Mainmam> is there decent money to be made in web design? i'm thinking about doing SEO but would rather just make websites :P
[22:13:45] <coldhead> systemfault: grace hopper?
[22:14:04] <tw2113> systemfault why do you need a hero?
[22:14:10] <systemfault> coldhead: Meh…
[22:14:12] <tw2113> just look for people who know what they're doing
[22:14:21] <tw2113> Mainmam consider this
[22:14:31] <tw2113> businesses may not always be able to hire in-store
[22:14:33] <coldhead> rebecca is pretty heroic
[22:14:35] <nights> Mainmam: if you compare to zero there might be some.
[22:14:38] <Dr-Bombay> mainman: web design is not principally a software dev activity
[22:14:39] <tw2113> but if it means more business, they'll find a budget for a website
[22:14:44] <wkmanire> nights: You can provide callback handlers for each of your ajax requests and use the promise objects to know when they've both completed to work with that collected data.
[22:14:55] <systemfault> tw2113: It just me… I'm telling my coworkers that women can also be good at programming..
[22:15:02] <Dr-Bombay> mainman: you have to have art talent
[22:15:06] <tw2113> that they can systemfault
[22:15:09] <systemfault> tw2113: But seems that I have no example… there's no genius.
[22:15:13] <systemfault> (it seems)
[22:15:46] <coldhead> systemfault: you seen the cash etsy is pouring into lady developers?
[22:15:54] <coldhead> god bless their crafty hearts
[22:16:09] <tw2113> ah pinterest, a site i avoid like herpes
[22:16:20] <systemfault> pinterest doesn't pinterests me.
[22:16:35] <coldhead> herpes is incurable.. so...
[22:16:42] <tw2113> and so is pinterest
[22:16:51] <coldhead> ohohoho
[22:16:54] <nights> wkmanire: so in the example on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/  responseText on line 5
[22:16:54] <nights> comes from page1 and page2 so to say?
[22:17:15] <nights> so you basically have to apply a filter in there to know which page returned it?
[22:17:36] * tw2113 makes his 2nd pizza of the day
[22:17:47] <nights> or what does the arguments function(a1,  a2) come from?
[22:17:49] <tw2113> smaller $2.50 ones
[22:17:50] <systemfault> tw2113: Bad for your health! (Like pinterest)
[22:18:10] <wkmanire> nights: Wow, this is nicer than I even realized. You get the arguments from both ajax success callbacks passed to you done callback.
[22:18:25] <nights> wkmanire: yeah, it seems like that....
[22:18:29] <nights> very nice.
[22:18:46] <wkmanire> nights: Set up your code like you see in the example, then put "debugger;" at the top of your .done callback.
[22:18:48] <systemfault> wkmanire: Yeah, the idea is so well implemented that I'm surprised it's in jquery :P
[22:19:07] <wkmanire> Then in your console run enter "arguments" and look at what you get.
[22:19:13] <nights> wkmanire: never mind, my brain doesnt process commented code anymore :(  explaination was in there
[22:19:45] <wkmanire> nights: I'm guilty of that too pretty often.
[22:20:03] <nights> wkmanire: ok so this is clear to me, exactly what i need. thanks a bunch.
[22:20:16] <wkmanire> nights: You're welcome. Even if I had to beat it into your head. :D
[22:20:57] <nights> wkmanire: you certainly had to :P
[22:21:41] <Mainmam> I just need like 40k a year
[22:21:55] <dr0id> for?
[22:21:59] <Mainmam> i'm guessing if i keep making practice sites and people like my work I'll get work?
[22:22:03] <Mainmam> site development
[22:22:12] <coldhead> that's how it goes, Mainmam
[22:22:29] <coldhead> if you hang out here people often come by wanting paid work done
[22:22:37] <dr0id> is that how it goed with you coldhead
[22:22:43] <coldhead> no
[22:22:48] <coldhead> but i've seen it happen
[22:22:53] <coldhead> i only work for kisses
[22:22:54] <dr0id> you didn't like 'goed' ? :D
[22:23:01] <wkmanire> coldhead: And beer?
[22:23:11] <coldhead> kisses is my special word for nazi gold
[22:23:17] <coldhead> i like goed, dr0id
[22:23:41] <coldhead> bot-t: tell LukeNukem ping me buddy
[22:23:41] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[22:23:44] <nights> my website 10 folds traffic every 10 weeks ... is that fast?
[22:23:44] <dr0id> Mainmam: also there's #freelance
[22:23:50] <nights> unique numbers
[22:23:54] <dr0id> depends
[22:24:09] <wkmanire> dr0id: For when you get old.
[22:24:15] <dr0id> if it was 1 unique 10 weeks ago and 10 unique now, then, well ...
[22:24:28] <dr0id> wkmanire: ?
[22:24:28] <nights> its in a number of thousands per week
[22:24:47] <dr0id> then that's good, show us the website
[22:24:50] <dr0id> is it the next facebook ?
[22:24:55] <tw2113> mmmm freelancing
[22:25:08] <wkmanire> dr0id: http://www.wideawakeinwonderland.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/depends5.jpg
[22:25:23] <systemfault> Rigghhhtttt
[22:25:29] <nights> dr0id: a sale generates $5-10 but conversion is very low now, 5-10%
[22:25:30] <dr0id> ...
[22:25:47] <dr0id> well
[22:25:49] <Dr-Bombay> oh no i accidentally closed my browser, it's all over
[22:26:03] <Mainmam> 5-10% is pretty high
[22:26:06] <Mainmam> :S
[22:26:09] <dr0id> 10% of 10k uniques is, 1000 x $10 = $10k a month, not bad
[22:26:30] <dr0id> and you were talking in weeks, so that's $40k a month
[22:26:39] <dr0id> what Mainmam wants to make in a year, you are making in a month!
[22:26:53] <Mainmam> I work at starbucks rn
[22:26:54] <dr0id> so you are === 12 Mainmam's
[22:26:56] <Mainmam> and i hate it so bad
[22:27:14] <dr0id> you make coffee there
[22:27:15] <dr0id> ?
[22:27:17] <Mainmam> ya
[22:27:22] <Mainmam> for 7.80 an hour
[22:27:28] <systemfault> I used to work in a chicken restaurant….
[22:27:28] <systemfault> lol
[22:27:30] <Mainmam> and i clean all day
[22:27:41] <dr0id> you should do overtime for more bucks then
[22:27:43] <coldhead> you'll get there, Mainmam
[22:27:43] <Mainmam> if i'm not making drinks or helping customers i'm cleaning
[22:27:44] <dr0id> :P
[22:27:51] <wkmanire> Mainmam: Are you really serious about doing this for a living?
[22:27:51] <coldhead> a thousand less deservng jerks have managed
[22:27:59] <dr0id> coldhead: lol
[22:28:10] <Mainmam> i already know css, html, and jquery well
[22:28:13] * tw2113 found success in freelancing by teaming up with people who can't or don't want to do css/coding, but can design
[22:28:18] <wkmanire> Mainmam: Do you know javascript well?
[22:28:27] <martisj> tw2113: winning?
[22:28:32] <Mainmam> I wanted to make my own SEO site but got a bit discouraged from the prospect of writing articles
[22:28:46] <dr0id> ya you get paid $1 for 300 words, rofl
[22:28:48] <tw2113> i'd be living a lot more comfortably if i worked faster
[22:29:00] <tw2113> and a bit more efficiently
[22:29:06] <tw2113> and charged more per hour
[22:29:15] <coldhead> the internet doesn't really need more SEO sites about whatever people think is bankable ATM
[22:29:19] <tw2113> but i pay my bills :)
[22:29:24] <Mainmam> wkmanire: I know jquery in-deptth
[22:29:24] <wkmanire> Mainmam: Learn 1 or 2 server side languages. Then start trying to apply for 20 or 30 different jobs a week. You'll get a chance to fail within 6 months.
[22:29:27] <coldhead> the internet needs more cockfighting
[22:29:34] <tw2113> coldhead i finally added meta descriptions to one of my sites the other day
[22:29:44] <coldhead> i remember you saying
[22:29:46] <coldhead> congrats
[22:29:59] <wkmanire> Mainmam: To know jquery in-deptth one must know javascript even deptthier young grass hoppahhh.
[22:30:04] <coldhead> what a digital age post-global village we live in
[22:30:12] <Mainmam> i learned a bit of javascript
[22:30:17] <Mainmam> but jquery just makes it less difficult
[22:30:19] <coldhead> yeah i'd be very wary of saying i knew anything in depth except on my CV
[22:30:24] <Mainmam> no reason to learn all the javascript terminology
[22:30:37] <Mainmam> i made an animated nav bar that was pretty baller using jquery
[22:30:43] <coldhead> links?
[22:30:47] <tw2113> Mainmam think of it this way
[22:30:47] <tw2113> there's javascript without jquery
[22:30:56] <tw2113> there's no jquery without javascript
[22:31:08] <Mainmam> i have the folder with the files on my p
[22:31:09] <Mainmam> c
[22:31:52] <tw2113> y no server online?
[22:31:55] <tw2113> that's just rude
[22:32:03] <tw2113> you're already failing at marketing  yourself
[22:32:26] <coldhead> tw2113: try putting that statement in a more positive way
[22:32:32] <dr0id> there are so many free hosting these days
[22:32:33] <coldhead> like :you are succeeding at failing:
[22:32:39] <dr0id> you could even use dropbox
[22:32:41] <beancurd> Mainmam: you should share baller stuff with the world.
[22:32:41] <systemfault> coldhead++
[22:32:44] <tw2113> inflated egos help no one cold :)
[22:32:45] <Mainmam> i hadn't exactly planned on sharing it :P
[22:33:00] <dr0id> sharing is caring
[22:33:01] <Mainmam> 1 sec
[22:33:04] <Mainmam> i'll get it up
[22:33:05] <dr0id> but..
[22:33:05] <beancurd> then the world will tear it apart, judge it, and steal it.
[22:33:09] <tw2113> Mainmam you can say you
[22:33:11] <wkmanire> oh man
[22:33:11] <beancurd> then. you will be stronger.
[22:33:11] <tw2113> 're awesome
[22:33:12] <wkmanire> oh..... man
[22:33:18] <tw2113> but once you prove it, can i believe it
[22:33:20] <wkmanire> I'm trying so hard not to laugh my ass off.
[22:33:29] * wkmanire takes a deep breath.
[22:33:32] <beancurd> then. you can fight the final boss.
[22:33:37] <coldhead> good work, take 5
[22:33:56] * tw2113 thinks everyone should have a domain that acts like a sandbox/show n tell
[22:34:16] <tw2113> doesn't necessarily need a kickass design
[22:34:25] <tw2113> but just links to various pages that show your knowhow
[22:34:53] <tw2113> i living interactive portfolio for the fancier stuff
[22:35:11] <wkmanire> Mainmam: Don't use the word baller to describe something you've written at an interview. Most of the guys doing hiring are from the "Dude", "Cool", "Kick-ass", "rocks" era.
[22:35:11] <Mainmam> https://www.yousendit.com/download/QlVqTkFzTkx0TWxvZE1UQw
[22:35:44] <dr0id> lol, are you serious ?
[22:35:46] <beancurd> yousendit?
[22:35:49] <beancurd> wtf.
[22:35:51] <systemfault> :/
[22:35:52] <beancurd> i feel like i'm getting trolled
[22:36:03] <systemfault> At least.. use the public folder of your dropbox account..
[22:36:15] <beancurd> i'm going to download this.
[22:36:23] <wkmanire> beancurd: Be strong.
[22:36:26] <durre> how do I catch an error from a jsonp request? from $.ajax it doesn't go into the error-function
[22:36:27] <dr0id> if you don't have dropbox let me know, I'll send you an invitation, that gives me 250mb extra space iirc.
[22:36:40] <Xtrivity> Hey guys, I have a piece of code i wrote, i'm trying to grab my content where font size=6.. so (.class:eq(0) font).attr('size')... what am i missing.. i tried .attr('size=6') but that didn't work
[22:36:49] <wkmanire> durre: What is the status code coming back from the server?
[22:36:53] <systemfault> lol
[22:36:59] <systemfault> font tags are le lulz
[22:37:08] <greedo> hmm, so what's a good klout score?
[22:37:18] <tw2113> 0
[22:37:20] <Xtrivity> systemfault i understand, but it's just a practice.. i didn't write that part of the code.. essentially trying to scrape it
[22:37:21] <tw2113> :)
[22:37:48] <durre> wkmanire: well, 200 according to chrome. should be 401, but maybe its different with jsonp
[22:37:49] <systemfault> Xtrivity: $('font[size="6"]') ?
[22:38:18] <systemfault> durre: jsonp is an ugly hack.. you'll always get a 200
[22:38:53] <durre> systemfault: CORS is the way to go nowadays?
[22:38:55] <wkmanire> systemfault: Not always...
[22:39:04] <systemfault> durre: Not really :'(
[22:39:16] <systemfault> durre: Unless you don't need to support IE7 IIRC
[22:39:17] <Mainmam> neone look at my navbar?
[22:39:32] <khurram> hi every one
[22:39:34] <systemfault> Mainmam: Yeah… it shows you're not a designer :/
[22:39:43] <durre> systemfault: this is for a mobile app based on html5 & js… no need for IE7 :)
[22:39:59] <Mainmam> i guess, it's the first thing I made outside of a tutorial
[22:40:03] <systemfault> durre: Then CORS would definitely be cleaner.
[22:40:10] <beancurd> Mainmam: it works.
[22:40:24] <Xtrivity> systemfault thanks a bunch, that was the syntax i was looking for
[22:40:52] <khurram> in my javascript file i am loading an xml file and i want it to begin from the absolute path  i am in a different direcoty  i.e   i am in  wdev/500/htdocs/nami/ and i want to load xml from  wdev/web/fwo/myxml.xml ?
[22:41:11] <khurram> i am using  $.get("i want to give path here ..." ..
[22:41:26] <wkmanire> durre: If the script coming back from the server has an error in it it should show up in your console.
[22:41:33] <vl1234> hi hi....very gud morning\
[22:41:44] <coldhead> how nice to see you, vl1234
[22:41:47] <StevenCodes22> sup nikkuh im drunk bitch
[22:41:51] <beancurd> SUP
[22:41:53] <coldhead> oh god
[22:41:54] <wkmanire> durre: Is the server public? can you paste a GET request that will show me the JSON?
[22:41:57] <wkmanire> rather, script.
[22:42:19] <durre> wkmanire: it's not public I'm afraid… at least not yet :)
[22:42:35] <tw2113> Mainmam next challenge, get it to activate on hover, in the whole height of the border you have there
[22:42:49] <tw2113> and have something happen when you mouseout, instead of just automatically resetting
[22:43:07] <vl1234> i want to know how to convert text field to text area whenever focus the text field
[22:43:24] <vl1234> @coldhead......i want to know how to convert text field to text area whenever focus the text field
[22:43:37] <wkmanire> If you're getting 200, then make sure that the javascript coming back from the server is perfect. Also it wouldn't hurt to make sure your response is the right MIME type.
[22:43:43] <khurram> coldhead:
[22:43:57] <khurram> @coldhead
[22:44:49] <dr0id> coldhead:
[22:44:52] <dr0id> @coldhead
[22:45:01] <khurram> dr0id:
[22:45:04] <wkmanire> vl1234: You can't convert an existing element but you can swap it out.
[22:45:08] <dr0id> khurram:
[22:45:13] <khurram> in my javascript file i am loading an xml file and i want it to begin from the absolute path  i am in a different direcoty  i.e   i am in  wdev/500/htdocs/nami/ and i want to load xml from  wdev/web/fwo/myxml.xml ?
[22:45:29] <wkmanire> vl1234: Look at http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[22:45:50] <dr0id> keep on appending ../ until it works :P
[22:45:57] <durre> wkmanire: it's coming back as: jsonp1(undefined,401);
[22:45:57] <khurram> reakkt
[22:46:06] <khurram> really ? is that the only solution?
[22:46:08] <wkmanire> durre: :)
[22:46:31] <wkmanire> durre: Now you just need to see why the server would give you a response like that.
[22:46:44] <wkmanire> either your request is malformed or your server misbehaving.
[22:46:51] <tw2113> wkmanire stop teaching people how to fish
[22:46:58] <tw2113> er, i mean, keep up the good work
[22:46:59] <wkmanire> In both cases you can spank something.
[22:47:22] <systemfault> durre: Are you serving JSONP or json from your server?
[22:47:35] <wkmanire> tw2113: he he, guilty as charged.
[22:48:39] <Mainmam> i never was really good at drawing thing
[22:48:40] <Mainmam> s
[22:48:56] <Mainmam> but I think I have some sense for what type of colors look good
[22:49:03] <durre> systemfault: for my part, jsonp … but also json, xml. I only have access to the backend of the server, not the frontend that format the responses so I'm not that familiar with those parts
[22:49:26] <Mainmam> font selection and such
[22:50:36] <systemfault> durre: I meant.. you understand that JSONP is not JSON?
[22:51:03] <systemfault> You can't just change the word json for jsonp in jquery and expect the server to send the good format.
[22:51:19] <nights> dr0id: yes it does make some money
[22:51:38] <nights> but actually as traffic goes up conversion goes down :(
[22:51:44] <nights> its as low as 3% now
[22:52:17] <durre> systemfault: yes, I know that jsonp ! = json
[22:52:18] <Mainmam> have you heard of a/b testing?
[22:52:27] <systemfault> Yeah...
[22:52:34] <systemfault> It's a must..
[22:52:58] <Mainmam> nights: and put some pictures of credit cards on your site, makes people spend more :P
[22:52:59] <beancurd> sometimes the client doesn't like you running tests on their lists.
[22:53:11] <nights> Mainmam: i already support credit cards
[22:53:23] <coldhead> vl1234: http://jsfiddle.net/x9hpW/
[22:53:40] <beancurd> unless you're doing stuff internally, or have explicit permission do do a/b testing, then it rarely happens most of the time.
[22:53:43] <nights> negotiated the rate down to unheard levels because the merchant believed in my idea.
[22:54:03] <Mainmam> having pictures of credit cards on the site in addition to just the option of paying with credit cards gets people to spend more
[22:54:22] <nights> i dont want people to use it though
[22:54:29] <nights> i make 50% more if they pay cash
[22:54:52] <wkmanire> business... marketing... bleh
[22:55:11] <Mainmam> people in experiments spent more cash when they were around credit card insignias
[22:55:28] <beancurd> it's where the money is.. unfortunately :(
[22:55:30] <nights> Mainmam: checkout forms need to send the right signals
[22:56:07] <beancurd> all this jquery/html/css shit will die out. we'll be 60year old obsolete nerds.
[22:56:10] <nights> some customers think certain pages doesnt "look safe" completely unrelated to actual technologies sued
[22:56:15] <nights> used
[22:56:27] <nights> beancurd: what will replace it?
[22:56:29] <wkmanire> beancurd: Knowing jQuery, HTML and CSS does not make you a nerd.
[22:56:35] <wkmanire> It makes you a webmonkey.
[22:56:52] * tw2113 eats a banana
[22:56:58] <beancurd> wkmanire: you're right.
[22:57:03] <nights> i certainly liked programming c++ more :(
[22:57:14] <nights> but no one needs a c++ programmer nowadays
[22:57:15] <beancurd> i was trying to make a point about the longevity of our profession.
[22:57:26] <wkmanire> nights: Google has quite a few working on v8.
[22:57:38] <tw2113> the ones who will survive long term will adapt and evolve with the times beancurd
[22:57:40] <nights> except shitty IBs and gooo...
[22:57:40] <beancurd> it just feels like we're expendable and have short expiry dates compared to other industries.
[22:58:09] <tw2113> tell people 5 years ago about SASS and they'd shit bricks
[22:58:30] <nights> its your responsibility to learn new technologies.. ive migrated through several.
[22:58:43] <nights> jquery isnt the most smooth one though,..
[22:58:46] <beancurd> tw2113: i'm on top of most things these days, but i imagine there'd be a time where i don't have the energy to do so, and then i'm fucked.
[22:58:48] <tw2113> tell people 10 years ago that javascript would come roaring back, they'd literally shit bricks
[22:59:19] <wkmanire> beancurd: I have a theory about that. One day being able to program will be so useful that it will be a secondary requirement to most deskjobs. I think one day it will be "I'm a xxxx and I can program."
[22:59:26] <wkmanire> beancurd: I have another theory too.
[22:59:29] <Cork> and that ie will be the only browser on win8 is a nice recap too ;P
[22:59:36] <phidev> wkmanire, no
[22:59:41] <wkmanire> What we do for a living is no more than 40 years old. No one knows what the fuck they are doing yet.
[22:59:48] <nights> wkmanire: its funny you said google. ive worked at google for a year.
[22:59:49] <phidev> wkmanire, I know.
[23:00:23] <wkmanire> When we've been writing software for as long as we've been building things out of stone we'll probably get it right.
[23:00:32] <beancurd> wkmanire: don't know.. most people don't even know how to operate computers at a technically competent level yet.
[23:00:38] <phidev> wkmanire, people who say everyone should code should get familiar with the vast areas of art and skill people over our industries posess.
[23:00:50] <phidev> wkmanire, maybe "everyone should be able to design"
[23:00:55] <phidev> "everyone should have material knowledge"
[23:00:58] <phidev> "everyone this"
[23:01:02] <phidev> "everyone that"
[23:01:11] <beancurd> everyone should know when to step away from shit they know nothing about.
[23:01:17] <phidev> You have the modern educational system where you're taught everything and tou forget it
[23:01:29] <nights> i hate talk of design...please stop
[23:01:29] <nights> :(
[23:01:36] <phidev> tou/you
[23:01:51] <nights> everyone i come in contact with and most recently our investor things design is like 1% of the development and hired us a useless designer woman
[23:01:53] <phidev> See, everything with nickname nights hates design.
[23:01:58] <beancurd> i hold a bachelor of design :D
[23:01:59] <wkmanire> phidev: Not sure where you're going with all that.
[23:02:02] <phidev> Designers hate everyone with nickname nights ;)
[23:02:13] <beancurd> and comp. sci.
[23:02:24] <phidev> wkmanire, it means that no, not everyone will know how to program. It's a false goal and it won't happen.
[23:02:27] <beancurd> i had much more fun in design. because wimmens.
[23:03:08] <wkmanire> phidev: We'll see. I've got a feeling it will be a common skill. If I'm wrong in a few hundred years I'll buy you a beer.
[23:03:19] <phidev> wkmanire, I'll wait :|
[23:03:25] <nights> though design eventually comes down to dealing with the likes of junk like browser fallbacks. css is not designer womens brighest area...
[23:03:58] <phidev> nights, I doubt the problem was she was a woman. Judge people in skills.
[23:04:10] <tw2113> i do html/css/js/lower intermediate php/etc and call myself a front end developer
[23:04:13] <phidev> nights, I know great women designers, and women developers in fact.
[23:04:15] <nights> haha you dont know where i am.
[23:04:22] <tw2113> california nights
[23:04:25] <nights> no
[23:04:29] <tw2113> damn
[23:04:33] <nights> i didnt work at MW.
[23:04:38] <coldhead> bot-t: tell vl1234 i will never forget you
[23:04:39] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[23:04:57] <beancurd> nicole sullivan is pro.
[23:05:01] <wkmanire> bot-t: tell bot-t again
[23:05:01] <bot-t> wkmanire, Stop playing with me!
[23:05:07] <beancurd> she's wimmens.
[23:05:07] <phidev> In fact, women developers are so trying to prove they're good developers in some companies, they become better than men.
[23:05:10] <wkmanire> :( Recursive failure.
[23:05:17] <phidev> Mostly because of sexism.
[23:05:29] <nights> phidev: not in this part of the world.
[23:05:34] <phidev> nights, which part.
[23:05:41] <nights> here they are called otsubone
[23:05:44] <nights> and no one likes them
[23:05:56] <nights> feel free to quote me on that.
[23:06:01] <phidev> Japan?
[23:06:02] <beancurd> japan?
[23:06:08] <wkmanire> japan?
[23:06:12] <nights> japan
[23:06:12] <beancurd> japan?
[23:06:31] <wkmanire> bot-t: tell nights Japan?
[23:06:32] <bot-t> wkmanire, Okay.
[23:07:01] <phidev> nights, nobody likes them is a crappy excuse
[23:07:21] <nights> phidev, i used to be like you
[23:07:21] <bot-t> (49 secs ago) <wkmanire> tell nights Japan?
[23:07:35] <nights> things change when you experience things first hand
[23:07:40] * wkmanire rolls his eyes.
[23:07:58] <phidev> nights, it's how our mind works. We take experience and simplify by prejudice.
[23:08:11] <phidev> night, but that doesn't mean you found the root cause of your problem.
[23:08:12] <wkmanire> coldhead: Were you messing with clojure already a few years ago?
[23:08:21] <wkmanire> I think I remember you saying something about that.
[23:09:24] <phidev> nights, have you tried judging people's skills based on other criteria? How tall they are, how much they weigh?
[23:09:33] <phidev> nights, what is their family like.
[23:09:37] <phidev> Infinite criteria.
[23:09:42] <phidev> Maybe you'd stumble onto something.
[23:09:54] <tw2113> nights is going to have a hard time making an entire country reconsider their bias
[23:10:04] <phidev> Well.
[23:10:28] <wkmanire> $( "#japan" ).replaceWith( "<california>" );
[23:10:32] <wkmanire> That'd make a lot of otaku happy.
[23:10:50] <Dr-Bombay> it's a personal tactical decision to go along with other people's biases or not
[23:11:02] <nights> tw2113: correct
[23:11:06] <coldhead> wkmanire: yeah, i'm still playing with clojure
[23:11:22] <coldhead> i'm about to spend a month with overtone as my only musical outlet
[23:11:26] <coldhead> which should be interesting
[23:11:30] <phidev> Dr-Bombay, it is. But... if you start believing yourself, you make poor decisions.
[23:12:23] <nights> phidev: man, im from the country with the best,...err, highest gender equality in the world. im not borat.
[23:12:45] <wkmanire> coldhead: wow, DSL.
[23:13:00] <beancurd> nights, on paper
[23:13:02] <coldhead> music via emacs, living the dream
[23:13:04] <wkmanire> coldhead: Seems like a lot of folks are happy about the extensible reader.
[23:13:11] <wkmanire> (definst foo [] (saw 220))
[23:13:42] <coldhead> its a thing of beauty
[23:13:53] <grymek> hi guys, how to select attribute + class, ill tried everything, i mean : $(input.form).    where input is some button and form is a css class
[23:14:50] <nights> beancurd: yes, on paper of course.
[23:15:17] <wkmanire> coldhead: You aughta build a saw wave form display with seesaw.
[23:15:24] <nights> nice, found another bootstrap bug. im running out of bug reporting ink...
[23:15:31] <wkmanire> coldhead: The options for naming that project are endless.
[23:15:53] <wkmanire> seesaw-saw-see
[23:15:55] <wkmanire> comes to mind
[23:16:19] <tw2113> we need more plugins/projects based off of characters from Kevin Smith movies
[23:18:11] <phidev> nights, you can judge how a society sees something by the words they use. Josei, fujin, onna.
[23:18:49] <phidev> nights, and otsubone.
[23:18:59] <wkmanire> phidev: You like this shit don't ya.
[23:19:28] <phidev> wkmanire, what "this shit" is?
[23:19:42] <coldhead> hahahaha wkmanire
[23:19:55] <coldhead> i'll see what arises and consult with you before i launch
[23:20:02] <nights> phidev: fine, i surrender (french accent)
[23:20:11] <wkmanire> philisophical debates/changing peoples lives through infinite wisdom
[23:20:24] <wkmanire> coldhead: :D
[23:21:22] <phidev> wkmanire, I'm your friendly neighborhood philosophical-debated-changing-peoples-lives-through-infinite-wisdom spiderman.
[23:21:47] <nights> nice.
[23:21:56] <nights> last time i had this discussion it was with my brothers wife...she reminds me a lot of phidev
[23:22:24] <phidev> wkmanire, no, I just like to learn how people think. It helps me learn.
[23:22:39] <phidev> wkmanire, we really have no clue why we think what we think a lot of the time.
[23:22:43] <wkmanire> phidev: Are you a university student?
[23:22:51] <coldhead> i think that our personal consciousness is just a local instance of a universal consciousness
[23:23:02] <coldhead> people tune it in like a radio
[23:23:06] <phidev> coldhead, you soak up your environment
[23:23:16] <coldhead> right now i am soaking up a fire alarm
[23:23:20] <coldhead> feels good
[23:23:30] <phidev> coldhead, do you feel like settings things on fire?
[23:23:30] <ndss56> lol
[23:23:36] <wkmanire> I want to soak up another beer but was instructed not to.
[23:23:38] <nights> phidev: so you are saying you dont really know why you are typing here?
[23:23:42] <coldhead> i feel like setting fire to a bucketbong
[23:23:44] <sa2304> ?ajax
[23:23:45] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[23:24:00] <wkmanire> ?bot-t
[23:24:01] <phidev> nights, I do. Conversations are mutually useful.
[23:24:02] <bot-t> wkmanire, JQuery bot commands - The bot in the #jquery channel on Freenode has a few commands that should help in collaborative debugging or explanations. http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[23:24:23] * tw2113 is just useless and an indent monkey :D
[23:24:37] <wkmanire> tw2113: I replaced you with an emacs.
[23:24:46] <tw2113> noooooo
[23:24:49] <phidev> But also everyone on IRC not asking a technical question or being very specific in their goal, is probably a bit bored and/or lonely.
[23:25:09] <coldhead> they'd be lonelier and more bored without IRC
[23:25:14] <tw2113> could have at least made me a sublime text snippet wkmanire
[23:25:31] <wkmanire> phidev: I'm not bored now that I have you in my buffer.
[23:25:42] <nights> phidev: i dont see where the word mutual fits in here?
[23:25:49] <phidev> nights, haha
[23:26:03] <wkmanire> sweet
[23:27:39] <phidev> Change of topic. How do you split your applications in modules for easy assembly/configuration?
[23:27:46] <wkmanire> phidev: requirejs
[23:27:58] <wkmanire> phidev: You're talking about strictly javascript right?
[23:28:28] <phidev> wkmanire, JS and in general.
[23:28:34] <phidev> I'm checking requireJS thanks
[23:28:53] <wkmanire> I like it a lot, but there is some controversy so beware.
[23:29:34] <phidev> Cool.
[23:29:49] <nights> phidev: have a look at coffeescript?
[23:29:50] <wkmanire> phidev: CommonJS modules are trying to be considered the standard...AMD and requirejs has some notes on the site about that.
[23:30:01] <phidev> My main architectural problem is I want ready prepackaged modules, with config and resources (images)
[23:30:09] <phidev> But I want the ability to override asnd configure them.
[23:30:13] <wkmanire> requirejs also comes with a tool for packaging up your modules for deployment.
[23:30:54] <wkmanire> Another option to consider is Google's Closure compiler. That is a serious piece of software.
[23:32:59] <phidev> Cool.
[23:33:36] <wkmanire> ?eval
[23:33:36] <bot-t> wkmanire: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[23:35:51] <coldhead> ?eval typeof undefined;
[23:35:55] <bot-t> coldhead: "undefined"
[23:36:42] <wkmanire> ?eval (function() { arguments.callee.call(this); }())
[23:36:46] <bot-t> wkmanire: No output. (Process Killed)
[23:36:49] <wkmanire> he he
[23:38:04] <coldhead> admirably handled, bot-t
[23:40:08] <nights> wkmanire: im not sure why i really need to use "when" ? wouldnt just "done" provide the same thing?
[23:40:31] <nights> (sorry assuming you remember the conversation earlier)
[23:40:59] <wkmanire> nights: hmmm, good question.
[23:41:28] <nights> if i need this to be sync i can define that in the first call
[23:41:48] <wkmanire> nights: You never need anything ajax related to be synchronous.
[23:41:56] <wkmanire> It is always a bad idea and the wrong solution.
[23:42:04] <nights> data flow wise you might need
[23:42:10] <wkmanire> nope.
[23:42:18] <nights> but ok, if you use callbacks i see what yo umean
[23:42:36] <wkmanire> The reason is that if anything goes wrong on the server and the response doesn't come back right away
[23:42:44] <wkmanire> then you will at the very least hang the browser.
[23:42:57] <wkmanire> IE will "Not Responding" and crash.
[23:43:06] <nights> at the very least, what could be worse than that client side? :)
[23:43:12] <nights> blowing up the computer
[23:43:47] <wkmanire> IE is part of windows. hanging can break all kinds of shit.
[23:44:12] <wkmanire> At least older versions were like that.
[23:46:05] <nights> ok
[23:46:12] <nights> point taken.
[23:46:16] <nights> but back to "when"
[23:46:33] <nights> why do i need it?
[23:46:45] <nights> if you would remind me again :)
[23:46:49] <nights> i cant see any reason
[23:46:54] <nights> though not saying there are no.
[23:47:39] <wkmanire> I'm not sure right off the top of my head.
[23:47:49] <wkmanire> I know done will runonce all of its promises have completed.
[23:48:01] <wkmanire> run once*
[23:48:08] <wkmanire> When is for queueing up promises.
[23:48:17] <nights> ah
[23:48:18] <wkmanire> but i think done can take promises directly.
[23:48:18] <nights> yeah
[23:48:24] <nights> yes
[23:48:28] <wkmanire> It's all pretty flexible.
[23:48:51] <nights> well, yeah. basically when is for timing action on the response of multiple requests
[23:50:36] <munderwo-work> Hi all. im using the ajax() call and I need to send json data in the body and http url parameters.. how do I do this?
[23:51:42] <coldhead> munderwo-work: method: 'POST' and put the GET vars in the URL
[23:51:53] <coldhead> and both kinds will show up on the server
[23:52:19] <munderwo-work> so when using a POST i can do both but not in the GET?
[23:52:47] <coldhead> if you do GET you can't supply POST data
[23:52:58] <coldhead> because it will take your data: as GET
[23:53:13] <coldhead> but if you specify POST then you can still sneak the GET vars into the URL manully
[23:53:16] <coldhead> manually*
[23:53:21] <systemfault> hack!
[23:53:22] <coldhead> manuel lanoy
