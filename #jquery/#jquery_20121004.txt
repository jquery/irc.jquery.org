[00:22:34] <karstenk1977_> I want to save all width of some elements of class "teaser" in an array? How can I do that?
[00:23:26] <karstenk1977_> with index
[00:24:23] <reloadz> hi! i have image with it attached form! and when i change some value in form, then it automatically .post() values to other file and updates DB! i also have option to add new image and then it append image and new form for that (new-)image, but form does not .post() values un till i have refreshed the page.... HTML IS 100% CORRECT
[00:24:27] <AdamPDotty> about $.each('.teaser', function(index){myarray[index] = this.widht;})
[00:24:38] <AdamPDotty> well basic idea
[00:27:25] <reloadz> hope my problem is written understandably
[00:29:22] <karstenk1977_> function main() {     var listWidth = [];     $('.teaser').each(function(index){         listWidth.push($(this).width());                      });console.log(listWidth);   }
[00:29:44] <karstenk1977_> that gives me an array with the width but without the index
[00:30:58] <AdamPDotty> then dont push just this.width but a new array with width and index in it
[00:35:08] <reloadz> ??????????????????????
[00:35:52] <MagePsycho> which jquery slider is good/better for sliding products (which has image, title, add to cart button)?

[01:13:14] <karstenk1977_> How can I get the offset width and height? I got undefined
[01:13:31] <CodesStuff> ?demo
[01:13:42] <CodesStuff> or was it @demo
[01:13:45] <CodesStuff> ?demo stuff
[01:13:49] <CodesStuff> hmm
[01:13:59] <CodesStuff> CodesStuff ?demo
[01:14:03] <CodesStuff> ?demo CodesStuff
[01:14:45] <CodesStuff> livedemo?
[01:14:52] <CodesStuff> Shit. What was it again
[01:15:05] <CodesStuff> Anyways karstenk1977, toss i up on a jsfiddle
[01:15:10] <CodesStuff> it*
[01:15:24] <AdamPDotty> karsten: you mean offset.left and offset.top?
[01:16:19] <reloadz> CodesStuff: can you help me? :D
[01:16:20] <reloadz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12722575/jquery-added-form-works-after-refresh/12722705
[01:17:02] <karstenk1977_> no offsetWidth and offsetHeight
[01:17:31] <CodesStuff> reloadz: Is your router supposed to have your machine dmz'd? :P
[01:17:33] <karstenk1977_> width + margin + padding
[01:17:37] <CodesStuff> Then again it ISE's
[01:17:45] <karstenk1977_> + border etc.
[01:18:57] <reloadz> dmz'd?
[01:19:05] <CodesStuff> Also reloadz, it seems like your script isn't updating because it grabs the form values before you add a new field. I think that's the issue.
[01:19:33] <CodesStuff> Yes, either that or you're not behind a router. I went to http://109.229.202.10/home/server/public_html/dev/ to see if I could debug the problem on your machine, but it internal server error'd :P
[01:19:42] <blackspotwiggins> CodesStuff, bot is ded

[01:26:50] <DreamStiffler> hi
[01:26:57] <DreamStiffler> i never use jquery but pls help here http://jsfiddle.net/Uex9F/5/
[01:27:28] <DreamStiffler> i just need a link when on click displays div A1 and B1 and hides the others
[01:28:20] <xec_> DreamStiffler: i'm not sure what that means
[01:29:24] <DreamStiffler> simple i have 2 sets of divs which in each sets can be 10 divs or whatever..
[01:30:14] <DreamStiffler> and also i have a link that when click will display the first div in set A and B
[01:30:33] <xec_> oh i think i see what you mean. the first link should show the first div in each set and hide the others
[01:30:45] <DreamStiffler> when i click second link it will display the second siv of set a and b
[01:30:47] <anli> Can I find an element with a certain id in firebug?
[01:30:50] <DreamStiffler> and hides the others
[01:31:47] <AdamPDotty> like $('div').hide(); $('div.second').show();
[01:32:13] <xec_> DreamStiffler: it's probably easier to work with if the sets of divs have a containing element for each set
[01:32:16] <CodesStuff> anli: go to "Console" and type: console.log(getElementById('id_here'));
[01:32:25] <DreamStiffler> AdamP: yes...but my divs are dynamic
[01:32:29] <anli> Interesting way!
[01:32:37] <CodesStuff> Also, all of his div's have ID's starting with "#", so the selectors are gonna break
[01:32:37] <AdamPDotty> so?
[01:32:37] <CodesStuff> lol
[01:32:59] <DreamStiffler> ok lets remove #
[01:33:20] <xec_> anli: $$("#id")
[01:33:20] <AdamPDotty> while you are at it remove $
[01:33:34] <CodesStuff> xec_: Oh yeah, this is #jquery \o/
[01:33:35] <DreamStiffler> ok can you sample it for me in the fiddle?
[01:34:27] <anli> Is firebug broken now?
[01:34:29] <anli> Can inspect elements
[01:34:34] <anli> windows
[01:34:34] <CodesStuff> anli: F12
[01:34:43] <anli> Thats only how to bring it up
[01:34:53] <CodesStuff> Click "HTML"
[01:34:54] <anli> inspect element gives me an empty tree
[01:34:57] <CodesStuff> hmm
[01:35:01] <CodesStuff> F5? >_<
[01:35:12] <xec_> CodesStuff: $$ is shortcut for querySelectorAll in firebug irc
[01:35:17] <xec_> iirc*
[01:35:23] <anli> F5 would only reload the browser
[01:35:25] <CodesStuff> DreamStiffler: Hmm, maybe it would be a better idea to add a data attribute to each div to let jQuery know how to identify it.
[01:35:45] <CodesStuff> oh wait you do that with the function
[01:36:04] <anli> reloading the webpage does not change anything btw
[01:37:06] <anli> Time to become friend with chrome
[01:37:14] <CodesStuff> Hmm. Odd. I'm up to date at the moment, and have noticed no issues with FB :\
[01:39:01] <xec_> DreamStiffler: i would use classes for this purpose: http://jsfiddle.net/Uex9F/6/
[01:40:04] <xec_> DreamStiffler: the id on the links could be anything, just use .attr() to retrieve other attributes. just did id for brevity
[01:41:43] <DreamStiffler> my friends...i have a problem where i do not understand .attr() is
[01:42:11] <DreamStiffler> who is brevity
[01:42:18] <xec_> are you serious?
[01:42:35] <rooster> lol
[01:42:40] <xec_> if you're really uncertain, try googling it
[01:43:16] <rooster> Give him/her a break - I know a lot of native English speakers that have no idea what brevity means either...
[01:43:33] <rooster> :)
[01:43:43] <LloydK> Russell you gay
[01:43:45] <LloydK> hows tricks
[01:44:01] <xec_> rooster: i guess you're right
[01:44:17] <CodesStuff> dreamstiffler: Here is one solution: http://jsfiddle.net/p65Rs/
[01:44:17] <rooster> still a little bit funny tho'
[01:44:25] <CodesStuff> It's kinda ghetto, but should work for you
[01:44:27] <xec_> DreamStiffler: "for brevity" means i did it that way because it's shorter
[01:44:45] <|pez|> I have no idea what brevity means, and I feel like I know English rather well. :P
[01:45:28] <rooster> |pez|: So now you learned something :)
[01:45:32] <CodesStuff> xec_ did it neater than I :[
[01:45:41] <DreamStiffler> thanks for the word of the day
[01:45:52] <DreamStiffler> also im looking at yer code codestuff thanks
[01:46:25] <CodesStuff> np.
[01:46:38] <xec_> we did basically the exact same thing. added a class to all the divs and hide all of them, then retrieve data from the clicked link and show the matching divs
[01:46:57] <vlad_starkov> Question: Am I right thinking that changing params on $.ajaxPrefilter() affects globally every ajax request on the page?
[01:47:30] <CodesStuff> god. bootstrap feels like cheating
[01:47:31] <CodesStuff> http://i.imgur.com/0eLic.png
[01:47:52] <xec_> CodesStuff: yours doesn't work right though, he wanted *each* of the first divs from each set to open
[01:47:58] <CodesStuff> Ah
[01:48:09] <CodesStuff> I guess I didn't read that part.
[01:48:29] <CodesStuff> I mean, he could've justed wrapped them up in a span and showed them that way
[01:49:03] <xec_> well, he didnt want to show/hide the entire set, just one div from each
[01:50:09] <CodesStuff> ah
[01:50:26] <CodesStuff> Well, I've got cookies. WHAT NOW, SON?
[01:50:49] <DreamStiffler> btw im googling what the hell data-ref is brb...xec_ is right...although im gna try the span u talking bout
[01:51:20] <CodesStuff> Oh, it's a custom attribute
[01:51:33] <xec_> CodesStuff: dammit. cookies always win =(
[01:51:40] <CodesStuff> you can literally put <div poopy-farts="diahrea">WEEEEE</div>
[01:51:57] <CodesStuff> then $('div').attr("poopy-farts")
[01:51:58] <CodesStuff> lol
[01:52:07] <xec_> if you want it to be valid html5 you need data- as the prefix though
[01:52:19] <CodesStuff> ^^what he said
[01:52:24] <xec_> so data-poopy-farts
[01:52:25] <xec_> :D
[01:52:42] <DreamStiffler> actually xec_ said it right and i cant do span since these 2 divs will be far off from each other
[01:53:05] <DreamStiffler> can i try show u something in js?
[01:53:20] <CodesStuff> You can try anything you like, DreamStiffler.
[01:53:23] <CodesStuff> You're a shining star.
[01:53:34] <reloadz> i have functions that i need to use for two input fields, so instead of writeing ir two times is there a way to make selector combines thoes input fields (input dield nakes are uniqe)
[01:53:44] <CodesStuff> wat
[01:53:52] <DreamStiffler> i took this on google and tweaked a bit...my pref is still jquery if possible
[01:53:56] <DreamStiffler> hold on
[01:54:37] <reloadz> my eng sucks now!
[01:54:59] <xec_> reloadz: depends on the markup? do they have a common class or ancestor?
[01:55:10] <reloadz> $('input[name="stock"], input[name="price"]').change(function() {     -- selector dosn't work
[01:55:20] <DreamStiffler> hold on wierd it works on desktop but not on fiddle
[01:55:37] <xec_> reloadz: assuming the names are correct it should
[01:55:57] <reloadz> hmmmmmmmmmm!
[01:56:27] <MagePsycho> which jquery slider is good/better for sliding products (which has image, title, add to cart button)?
[01:56:57] <DreamStiffler> you guys need to apply this on local html..not sure why not working on fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/WzP57/1/
[01:58:02] <xec_> DreamStiffler: just choose "no wrap" from the dropdown in the left menu http://jsfiddle.net/WzP57/2/
[01:58:09] <CodesStuff> reloadz: $('input[name="price"],input[name="stock"]').change(function(){
[01:58:09] <CodesStuff> console.log($(this).val());
[01:58:09] <CodesStuff> });
[01:58:12] <CodesStuff> worked for me :P
[01:58:53] <CodesStuff> Note: It will only fire when the element loses focus
[01:58:54] <reloadz> $('body').on('change', 'input[name="stock"], input[name="price"]', function() { is there any difference in this selector? works for me!
[01:59:25] <CodesStuff> I've never used .on() before, so I'm not sure. What I pasted above works, though.
[01:59:31] <CodesStuff> http://jsfiddle.net/mv7DR/
[02:00:05] <xec_> reloadz: the difference is that's delegate syntax. if the code is run before the inputs exist in the DOM delegation is the way to go
[02:00:16] <DreamStiffler> ok cool thanks xec_
[02:00:27] <DreamStiffler> yeah this is what i want to do
[02:00:33] <DreamStiffler> but dynamic
[02:00:56] <xec_> DreamStiffler: why can't it be dynamic, what's the issue?
[02:02:12] <CodesStuff> Just output the generated content within the div's you specified
[02:02:41] <CodesStuff> Also, you're using regular ol' Javascript in #jquery :P
[02:02:43] <CodesStuff> that's silly
[02:09:23] <DreamStiffler> CodesStuff: yes i did it in js for a sample to be done in jquery as i do not know jquery
[02:10:16] <CodesStuff> DreamStiffler: Look at .show(), .hide(), etc
[02:10:41] <xec_> we already made you a sample...
[02:11:28] <DreamStiffler> ok ok i will into it thanks
[02:16:44] <PBDev> QUESTION: how to setup a preloader for nivoslider?
[02:39:36] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you remove an event from an element?
[02:41:08] <BinaryKitten> ?.off @ code_ph0y
[02:41:22] <BinaryKitten> darn wheres the bot when you need it
[02:41:45] <keirlav87> how can i make .replace change every instance of the thing I am trying to change in the string, not just the first one?
[02:41:57] <code_ph0y> wow binarykitten hows it going?
[02:42:05] <code_ph0y> not seen you in ages!
[02:42:22] <code_ph0y> thanks i'll google it
[02:42:58] <BinaryKitten> http://api.jquery.com/off @ code_ph0y
[02:43:13] <BinaryKitten> code_ph0y im ok.. been around on my secondary nick
[02:43:57] <code_ph0y> sweet ... you deving anything fun?
[02:44:29] <BinaryKitten> i wish
[02:44:51] <BinaryKitten> but now i have to go to the office
[02:45:12] <FinalAngel> is there a way within jquery to rebind scope? i'd like to get the first line after init working: http://jsfiddle.net/g7Aez/
[02:45:53] <FinalAngel> something like $('#blubb').bind('click', this.doSomething.call(that, e)); blah blah
[02:46:12] <BinaryKitten> FinalAngel you need to look at $.proxy
[02:46:25] <FinalAngel> isnt proxy gonna be depricated?
[02:46:55] <BinaryKitten> doesn't say so
[02:47:01] <BinaryKitten> where did you hear that?
[02:47:18] <FinalAngel> read/hard of it somewhere
[02:47:24] <FinalAngel> *heard
[02:47:32] <BinaryKitten> well for now it will work
[02:47:49] <BinaryKitten> the problem is the "this" gets substituted on the event handling function
[02:47:58] <FinalAngel> yeah exactly
[02:48:11] <BinaryKitten> so either you use the proxy, or you put the "that" before the bind
[02:48:28] <BinaryKitten> also, bind is deprecated
[02:48:31] <FinalAngel> ah it was "jQuery.event.proxy():" alright
[02:48:35] <PBDev> QUESTION: how to setup a preloader for nivoslider?
[02:48:40] <BinaryKitten> FinalAngel actually no
[02:48:46] <BinaryKitten> it was jQuery.proxy
[02:48:58] <FinalAngel> *jQuery.event.proxy(): This undocumented and deprecated method has been removed. Users should be calling the documented jQuery.proxy method instead.
[02:48:58] <PBDev> QUESTION: I actually just want the loading.gif to load, but it is not working.
[02:49:10] <BinaryKitten> ah
[02:49:12] <BinaryKitten> gotcha
[02:49:20] <FinalAngel> So yeah than I gonna use proxy :)
[02:49:28] <FinalAngel> thats a good info
[02:49:46] <FinalAngel> thank you BinaryKitten
[02:49:52] <BinaryKitten> personally i prefer the var thisObj = this; before hand
[02:50:01] <FinalAngel> yeah at some points for sure
[02:50:16] <FinalAngel> but sometimes proxy is better for readability
[02:50:48] <FinalAngel> i miss something like .bind() (like in prototype or mootools) a lot
[03:02:41] <PBDev> hello?
[03:02:46] <PBDev> can someone help?
[03:04:24] <PBDev> how do I get the freaking loading.gif to show in nivoslider?
[03:07:37] <code_ph0y> PBDev: firebug the hell out it ;)
[03:07:53] <PBDev> I've been looking with firebug
[03:07:55] <elephphant> Hey
[03:08:02] <elephphant> What is the return type of a
[03:08:04] <PBDev> the loading.gif css gets overwritten
[03:08:13] <elephphant> $() selector?
[03:08:19] <PBDev> by another stylesheet
[03:08:26] <PBDev> don't know how to make it show.
[03:09:24] <PBDev> do you know how I can fix it?
[03:10:20] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone im still struggling with an issue i don't know how to tackle
[03:10:25] <jarr0dsz> i hope someone has a good idea on how i could approach it
[03:11:07] <jarr0dsz> i want to have something like http://pix.am/FgEe.png
[03:11:25] <jarr0dsz> so you have a friendlist, and if you click on a freind each friend will generate a "chat" box on the left
[03:11:40] <jarr0dsz> anyone any idea how to do this? i have tried to look at some existant plugins but the code is all very fuzzy to figure it out
[03:13:05] <xec_> elephphant: jquery collection
[03:14:08] <jarr0dsz> could such thing as my screenshot be done with a jquery ui tabs somehow? or perhaps just divs show and hide them
[03:14:37] <jarr0dsz> onclick, show a certain chat modal, and position this left to the div that holds all friends
[03:29:37] <PBDev> HELLO!
[03:33:19] <tocka> HELOP
[03:34:37] <bodyoflies> hello world
[03:34:52] <mocas> hi, anyone uses flexslider?
[03:34:58] <bodyoflies> why i cannot append this AJAX: $("#superid").append('recent.php?limit=' + $("#limit1").val());
[03:35:20] <timrom_> Hello I have a question, kinda hard to explain. Here goes. If I have a string with hex values in it like: "#fff" for example, could I take that value and apply to lets say a div so that it would have that colour??
[03:35:32] <mocas> I use and it loads fine on ff, but not in chrome and ie but no error in console :( any tip?
[03:36:08] <PBDev> MY NIVOSLIDER AINT WORKING?!
[03:36:25] <PBDev> I MEAN THE LOADING.GIF AIN'T WORKING
[03:37:40] <bodyoflies> timrom_: retreive the hex value in a var, then use jquery css to apply it
[03:39:08] <timrom_> ahhh ok, hmm why did I not think about that?! Well thank bodyoflies:)
[03:39:16] <PBDev> I just want loading.gif to be display in the div until the image loads. It this so hard to do?
[03:39:51] <bodyoflies> PBDev: use jquery load ("img src = your gif />")
[03:41:08] <PBDev> where do I put that jquery load? > bodyoflies
[03:41:31] <bodyoflies> PBDev: before you use jquery load to load the image
[03:42:01] <bodyoflies> you use the first jquery load to load the gif, then the second jquery load to load your image
[03:42:14] <bodyoflies> the second jquery load will overwrite your gif
[03:42:22] <PBDev> this is what I am working on. http://www.robertjameslandscapes.com/portfolio/cat/72/image/118.html
[03:42:45] <jn_> Hi I have this snippet (http://pastebin.com/HGnse4HZ) which add/remove a class on <a> tags. What I need is to say: if the condition on line 3 is met, then add the class to the parent <li> tag and not the <a>
[03:43:05] <jarr0dsz> getting there step by step, guys do you know if a     $(this).animate({'height': '80px'}, 100); can also animate upwards?
[03:43:17] <jarr0dsz> when I do this it expands but it expands downwards
[03:43:18] <bodyoflies> PBDev: show me the code, not the website lol
[03:46:07] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/qJCmF/3/ nobody an idea ;p upward expanding shoudelt be that hard ?
[03:46:16] <jarr0dsz> im replicating the facebook instant messenger

[03:47:35] <bodyoflies> you must be new here
[03:47:35] <jarr0dsz> more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qJCmF/4/ but needs up expand
[03:47:42] <PBDev> whats funny?
[03:48:09] <bodyoflies> PBDev: you sent me all your codes, i just need that small snippet where you are loading your image
[03:48:29] <PBDev> well..its not all of it :-)
[03:50:08] <bodyoflies> wait

[04:06:21] <emattias> Anybody here who can help me log in to bugs.jqueryui.com ?
[04:06:24] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. It works on the first weekend, so for example checkDate(2) skips to Monday. Whereas checkDate(7) which should skip to the next Monday goes to a Satruday. Weekends should be skipped :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/

[04:08:40] <muszek> hi... I have a script where I often ask for val() or data(name) of an element.  I'm modifying the script in a way that makes it possible that those selectors return more than one element.  Is my assumption that val(), data() and other similar functions() would return the asked value of the first element correct?
[04:11:53] <PBDev> okay my loading.gif is not showing up
[04:12:09] <PBDev> do I need to have my images inside the div as img src?
[04:12:19] <PBDev> ...or would it work as background images for the divs?
[04:48:40] <JaredE> i have a value from an array like: arrids[i], and i have some json like [{id:23,label:hello},{id:13,label:meow}] how would i get the corresponding label for the id held in arrids[i]?
[04:50:15] <mazzachre> JaredE: Unless it is indexed, you would have to each your way through it and look at id
[04:50:23] <mehale> folks, how can I insert an [object HTMLDivElement] into code? $(´#mydiv´).append(myobject) prints: [object HTMLDivElement]
[04:51:04] <mazzachre> JaredE: A better solution is to fix the json with {23: {id:23,label:hello} ...}
[04:51:26] <JaredE> hmm
[04:52:01] <xec_> mehale: that should work, i suspect the DOM node may have been turned into a string before you pass it to .append()
[04:52:21] <xec_> mehale: try console.log(typeof myobject)
[04:52:30] <mehale> xec_ maybe, it comes as return of a function
[04:53:34] <mehale> xec_: it is a string,
[04:53:48] <xec_> that explains it then :)
[04:54:01] <mehale> return myobj; makes it a string :(
[04:54:18] <mehale> ok, anyway, how can I return the whole object html code, not only its guts?
[04:54:20] <xec_> mehale: return won't change a type.
[04:54:36] <mehale> maybe I did var a = ´´; a = myfunc();
[04:54:41] <mehale> could this be the cause?
[04:55:25] <xec_> mehale: no, whatever type myfunc returns, a will change into it. it's probably a string before you return it from the function
[04:55:47] <mehale> typeof inside the function sez object
[04:56:26] <JaredE> would this do it $.each(data,function(){if($(this).id == arrids[i]){return $(this).label} })
[04:56:56] <mehale> xec_: I will change this function to return string html code.
[04:57:37] <mehale> xec_: but... when I try: $(myobj).html(); it only prints the internal html, not the element that wraps pthe code. any fix to that?
[04:58:36] <xec_> mehale: you could put it in a temporary container, like: var temp = $("<div>").html(myobj); temp.html();
[04:58:54] <mehale> :) I found that on stackexchange and found it nasty :) :)
[04:58:57] <mehale> thanks xec
[05:00:25] <xec_> mehale: it's not very elegant. i would suggest something else, but i can't debug your code without seeing it live
[05:00:34] <mehale> ok, np. thanks!
[05:00:51] <xec_> mehale: returning a dom node from a function and passing it into .append() should work fine
[05:15:33] <GoSox> can I select an item by a custom attribute? Like i have elements that have a "data-id" attribute. can I select by that?
[05:18:31] <GoSox> actually nevermind easier to just do it in php
[05:19:46] <xec_> GoSox: just do [data-id]
[05:19:54] <GoSox> what do you mean
[05:19:55] <GoSox> ?
[05:20:30] <xec_> [data-id] { color: green; } will color all text green in elements with a data-id attribute
[05:21:05] <GoSox> no what i wanted to do was select the element where the data-id attribute has a specific value, and do something with that element
[05:21:16] <GoSox> but i just did what i wanted in php instead, probably much easier
[05:21:21] <xec_> then do [data-id="whatever"]
[05:21:36] <xec_> what do you mean you're going to select in php?
[05:21:57] <xec_> what exactly are you doing
[05:22:32] <GoSox> i was going to make a little jquery snippet that matches a specific cookie, to a list item that has a specific data-id. But rather than doing that in jquery, I just do it in PHP while buildling the list of LI's in the first place
[05:22:53] <GoSox> I'm already iterating through each one, just add a little check righ tthere nice and easy
[05:22:56] <xec_> oh, sorry, i thought i was in #css - my bad. what i said actually still applies though
[05:24:19] <bannaN> Hi, is it possible to have the jquery ajax call serialize the data parameter like : formfields.name&formfields.age instead of formfields[name]&formfields[age] ?
[05:30:38] <Usse> clear
[05:42:41] <pingec> if i create an iframe with jquery, will its loaded event trigger only after I append it to an element in the document?
[05:50:34] <kzrdt> hi
[05:50:55] <kzrdt> I don't succeed to select option in a select with jquery
[05:51:35] <kzrdt> I tried with element.val(value); and $("#element option[value='A']").attr('selected','selected');
[05:51:49] <kzrdt> but none of these solutions seems to work...
[05:51:53] <kzrdt> any idea?
[05:54:16] <faraway> kzrdt: sure the .val(...) does not work ?
[05:54:26] <faraway> kzrdt: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/jyrkL/
[05:56:35] <faraway> kzrdt: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/jyrkL/1/
[05:59:14] <kzrdt> hum... it seems it work, I just put the function on a click event and it works... The problem is that I'm populating the select on page load
[05:59:56] <Lurzino> Hello everyone!!! :-)))))))
[06:00:33] <kzrdt> is it because the option don't exist on page load?
[06:00:35] <faraway> kzrdt: i would guess that the select element is not present at the time you do the query ... did you do it when the dom was ready?
[06:01:39] <Lurzino> I'm trying to retrieve the status code of a $.getJSON here http://pastebin.com/Y77ERhKs but when it reaches the alert(status); it shows null... why?... any idea? Thanks in advance
[06:02:09] <faraway> kzrdt: the jquery selector result set represents the results of the dom at the time where you do the query .. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[06:03:33] <PBDev> QUESTION: everytime the nivoslider restarts, there is a very slight pause. How can I get rid of that, so that as soon as it moves to the next slide after it comes to the last on it is faster?
[06:03:41] <faraway> Lurzino: why do you use parseJSON  .. if the result of the query is a json string, getJSON will give you the parsed object in the data param
[06:03:52] <jacta> how to output all from a table with a class called .table01 - i want the whole table in a variable that can be posted, is that possible?
[06:04:15] <kzrdt> actually I work with getJson too to load my select
[06:04:49] <CodesStuff> jacta: Get the handle for the table, iterate through the cells and grab the .html(), dump it to a json object, then post
[06:05:04] <faraway> kzrdt: as i said if you want to change an element it must be in the dom at the time where you do the select query
[06:05:12] <CodesStuff> jsfiddle down for you guys, too?
[06:05:32] <tlkr> Lurzino: the alert is outside of the .getJSON function so will execute prior to status being changed.
[06:05:40] <Lurzino> faraway: it doesn't matter since I use the json structure inside the function showTableAddress().... the matter is to retrieve outside the getJSON the status.. in fact if I do alert(obj.status); inside the getJSON it shows "OK" or "OVER_QUOTA_LIMIT"... just outside getJSON I get always status = null....
[06:05:49] <kzrdt> so I just have to add a ready function on the element?
[06:05:53] <Lurzino> ah tlkr .... so what I can do?
[06:06:10] <faraway> Lurzino: is what tlkr said
[06:06:34] <faraway> Lurzino: getJSON is an async request
[06:06:40] <PBDev> well, anyone know?
[06:07:34] <faraway> Lurzino: sleep(...) where are you running your script in  ?
[06:07:49] <tlkr> Don't use sleep, put the alert inside the success function.
[06:08:12] <Lurzino> well faraway and tlkr  do you have a suggest to obtain that status variable outside getJSON ? because as you can see I need to know if I am on OVER_QUERY_LIMIT or not to repeat the command after 2 seconds....
[06:08:24] <Lurzino> faraway:  that sleep() is a own function I made
[06:09:42] <faraway> Lurzino: doesn't this block you browser ? .. anyway ... you need to replace your while loop with another structure
[06:10:59] <tlkr> Lurzino: my best suggestion is to place your request within a function and call the function from within the success function depending on the result of the getJSON instead of using a while loop.
[06:10:59] <Lurzino> faraway:  but I need to repeat the geocoding with same latitude / longitude when I am on OVER_QUERY_LIMIT status... that's why I am asking,..
[06:13:10] <faraway> Lurzino: something like that: http://pastebin.com/qMtkrbC7   but i didn't checked if code is correct its just that you can see the idea
[06:13:59] <gentoonoob> iam using jquery.submit, but i have a form with diffrent kinds of input fields, especially i want to upload files.. what framework shoudl i use to submit form data and upload a file ?
[06:14:32] <CodesStuff> jacta: you still around?
[06:15:35] <CodesStuff> jacta: This isn't very clean, but it works: http://pastebin.com/BxaY87w6
[06:16:00] <jacta> CodesStuff, i am, internet f***up :/ brb 2 sec - ill look mate
[06:16:41] <CodesStuff> The first .each() function doesn't use the key or value, but I left it there for shits and giggles
[06:17:06] <tlkr> Lurzino: http://pastebin.com/KEyUXqCz
[06:17:12] <CodesStuff> There is actually probably a better way to do it using some fancy recursive bs, but screw that \o/
[06:17:25] <tlkr> oh faraway beat me to it
[06:17:51] <PBDev> can I call a function within a jquery function?
[06:18:12] <CodesStuff> PBDev: Sure. Just make sure you've got access to the function
[06:18:36] <CodesStuff> A lot of devs toss the function in the window object to make global access easier, but that's not really the best way to go about doing it.
[06:18:59] <CodesStuff> Personally I always just toss in an extra parameter along with the value since Javascript syntax doesn't mind too much
[06:19:31] <PBDev> I want to call a function that will hide() or fadeout() a <img id=""> tag. But I can't make it work. http://pastebin.com/6RBqsdxZ
[06:19:33] <CodesStuff> It really bugs me that JSFiddle is down. I've been using *shudders* this http://w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro
[06:19:41] <Lurzino> tlkr and faraway , a little doubt: wouldn't that else if (status == 'OK') { checkGeocode(latitude, longitude); } have always the same latitude and longitude?... if it is OK then it should continue with next latitude and longitude data...
[06:21:09] <PBDev> or actually I want to put it in after slideshow end function, to hide the loading.gif img
[06:21:09] <CodesStuff> PBDev: Hmm.. you should have access to jQuery within beforeChange since it's creating the functions on window.load
[06:21:14] <PBDev> aynone know how?
[06:21:22] <tlkr> Lurzino: that's what your original code did ^^
[06:21:33] <CodesStuff> Oh I see.
[06:21:34] <PBDev> I tried, but as soon as I write anything in there the slide breaks.
[06:21:41] <PBDev> how do I write it in there?
[06:21:52] <CodesStuff> Generally you would press keys on your keyboard
[06:21:57] <CodesStuff> \o/
[06:22:13] <CodesStuff> I'm just reading your code. One sec.
[06:22:52] <CodesStuff> Can you try adding in an alert for slideshowEnd(), PBDev?
[06:22:56] <CodesStuff> Just see if it breaks it
[06:22:57] <Lurzino> uhm tlkr  then I should just remove the else thing to continue with next latitude and longitude right?
[06:23:06] <CodesStuff> Just alert($('#somediv').html());
[06:23:47] <CodesStuff> Also jacta, did the code I whipped up work for you?
[06:24:19] <PBDev> where do I put that? line 30?
[06:24:28] <PBDev> slideshowEnd()
[06:25:09] <CodesStuff> Put it between the curly braces
[06:25:26] <CodesStuff> slideshowEnd: function(){ alert("YOLO!"); },
[06:25:27] <mvk> is it possible to use a vorm of 'rotation' with jquery, ie, if .next('selector') is at the end ... it starts at first again?
[06:25:53] <CodesStuff> mvk: Maybe check if its == :last?
[06:26:23] <jacta> CodesStuff, yep - just fast tried, it says syntax error line 11
[06:26:52] <CodesStuff> jacta: Worked fine for me :\
[06:27:01] <CodesStuff> Did you try copying/pasting directly in a new document?
[06:27:11] <jacta> CodesStuff, can you jsfiddle it?
[06:27:16] <CodesStuff> jsfiddle is down
[06:27:29] <CodesStuff> I'll put it in a dropbox
[06:27:30] <PBDev> yeah, it broke the slide. doesn't show anything. here is what I did http://pastebin.com/zv1zdDVF
[06:27:30] <CodesStuff> One sec
[06:27:45] <mvk> big thanks CodesStuff !
[06:27:52] <PBDev> only added line 46
[06:28:26] <CodesStuff> np mvk.
[06:28:28] <CodesStuff> jacta: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17612316/jquery/jacta.html
[06:28:32] <CodesStuff> pbdev: Checking now
[06:28:46] <PBDev> oh I put the comma there as well, still not working
[06:29:07] <CodesStuff> PBDev: You redefined slideshowEnd
[06:29:14] <CodesStuff> See on line 43?
[06:29:48] <PBDev> so shall I remove line 43?
[06:30:51] <CodesStuff> Yes
[06:30:56] <CodesStuff> And put the alert
[06:31:00] <CodesStuff> er
[06:31:01] <CodesStuff> no
[06:31:02] <CodesStuff> yes
[06:31:02] <CodesStuff> fine
[06:31:03] <CodesStuff> do that
[06:31:04] <CodesStuff> lol
[06:31:18] <xec_> lol
[06:33:31] <mvk> CodesStuff: i have a couple of divs, in each div is a checkbox, when a checkbox is unchecked, the next checkbox must be turned on
[06:33:40] <mvk> how would my jquery selector look like? :)
[06:33:54] <kzrdt> faraway: thanks for your help by the way, I just had to use the callback function of getjson...
[06:36:23] <starsinmypockets> Wierd - this works in jsfiddle but not in chrome $(elem).after(function () {return 'foo'});
[06:36:24] <PBDev> still not working
[06:36:29] <CodesStuff> mvk: Uh, shit. I guess div>checkbox[checked=checked] or something?
[06:36:47] <toter> Hi… I'm a beginner. When I save the code from http://jsfiddle.net/5SGG9/2/ to a local .html file, the scrolling animation does not work. Why does it work only on jsfiddle?
[06:36:57] <CodesStuff> i guess you'd need input type="checkbox"
[06:36:58] <CodesStuff> idk
[06:37:13] <mvk> CodesStuff: but the first checkbox is also in a div
[06:37:29] <mvk> shouldnt i do .closest('div').next()  then?
[06:37:43] <CodesStuff> hmm..
[06:37:56] <CodesStuff> maybe parent>div:first
[06:38:02] <CodesStuff> I'm terrible with selectors
[06:38:14] <CodesStuff> I usually just iterate through each object manually >_<
[06:40:16] <CodesStuff> (For the record, I'm also really bad with regexp too)
[06:41:36] <PBDev> it aint working. As soon as I put something in there the slide break
[06:41:49] <CodesStuff> PBDev: Can you get a fiddle up?
[06:41:57] <PBDev> fiddle?
[06:41:57] <tlkr> Lurzino: you should apply some logic to the else if to increase the long/lat by an appropriate amount
[06:41:58] <mikel> could someone point me to where I can better understand -> jQuery(document).logEvent
[06:41:59] <CodesStuff> Or link me to the live version
[06:42:03] <CodesStuff> jsfiddle
[06:42:57] <PBDev> yeah sure. http://www.robertjameslandscapes.com/about.html The problem is once the slide ends, the loading image shows up in the beginning. I want to hide that <img id="loading">
[06:43:17] <PBDev> I used loading for the large images that takes time to load
[06:43:34] <PBDev> once the image is in the browser cache however, it no longer is necessary
[06:43:49] <starsinmypockets> Basically $(elem).after('foo') works whereas $(elem).after(function () {return 'foo'}); fails :/
[06:43:51] <PBDev> so I was thinknig of hiding it after the first slideshow ended
[06:43:55] <mvk> Ok, anyone else maybe?
[06:44:18] <mvk> i got a number of divs, with a checkbox in them, in case i deselect a checkbox, it should turn on the next checkbox
[06:44:26] <mvk> how would my selector look like? :)
[06:45:25] <CodesStuff> mvk: JSFIDDLE! :P
[06:45:59] <CodesStuff> PBDev: So.. preload all the images?
[06:46:21] <CodesStuff> starsinmypockets: semicolon?
[06:46:34] <Usse> any good images preload script?
[06:46:43] <bannaN> Does anyone know if its possible to have jquery's ajax method serialize the data parameter in a custom way. like user.name=a&user.age=17 instead user[name]=a&user[age]=17 ?
[06:46:50] <PBDev> No I don't think I need to do all that preloading stuff. I'm thinking the loading is okay
[06:47:00] <PBDev> I just want to hide the loading after the images have actually loaded
[06:47:09] <PBDev> I mean the "loading text"
[06:47:10] <padolsey> Usse: `new Image().src = 'image.jpg'` // not jQuery needed
[06:47:30] <CodesStuff> bannaN: Why not use JSON? :\
[06:47:42] <CodesStuff> make a "user" object then apply properties to it
[06:47:44] <Usse> thx
[06:47:59] <tlkr> bannaN: you could just name the inputs user[name], it's technically invalid HTML but /me shrugs
[06:48:14] <CodesStuff> tlkr: He wants custom serialization lol
[06:48:19] <starsinmypockets> CodeStuff - I think it's cuz this drupal install is running jquery1.3 :/
[06:48:45] <CodesStuff> starsinmypockets: Then swap it over.. or do you think it will screw with other portions of the site?
[06:49:01] <bannaN> CodesStuff: well, thats what i am trying to achieve now, but lets just say the backend isnt cooperating with me
[06:49:07] <starsinmypockets> CodeStuff - total nightmare
[06:49:57] <PBDev> well, what say you?
[06:50:03] <tlkr> bannaN: if you name the elements like I said above the backend will interpret it as an array, well, PHP does, I suspect aspx etc would do the same
[06:50:07] <CodesStuff> bannaN: What you should do is just grab the formdata, convert it to json, and send it that way.
[06:50:42] <CodesStuff> starsinmypockets: Check the changelogs between 1.8.2 and 1.3.*
[06:50:42] <bannaN> tlkr i am on perl, nothing is just automatic :)
[06:50:48] <CodesStuff> Oh god.
[06:50:49] <tlkr> uninstall perl
[06:50:51] <CodesStuff> ^^^
[06:51:06] <CodesStuff> Perl is great for quick little script. Automation, little crons, etc
[06:51:15] <CodesStuff> But using it as the backbone for your webapp isn't a great idea.
[06:52:22] <CodesStuff> Also, bannaM, take a look at this article: http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/perl-why-parameters-sucks-and-what-we-can-do.html
[06:52:48] <mvk> if i click on a checkbox in a div, how do i go to the next checkbox, in the next div? :)
[06:53:13] <CodesStuff> mvk, for the love of god >_< make a jsfiddle for me with your HTML
[06:53:24] <CodesStuff> I WILL HELP YOU. JUST PUT SOMETHING UP
[06:53:33] <CodesStuff> mvk: http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:53:37] <starsinmypockets> CodeStuff - i'm on drupal 6 - I think maybe I can figure out how to load the later jquery for this page i'm working on lonly, for now, in order to avoid a lot of bugs and a qa nightmare i don't need now
[06:53:54] <CodesStuff> That is an acceptable solution >_<

[06:56:03] <CodesStuff> Any ops present?
[06:56:12] <PBDev> so do you know how I can fix this. I just want something like this:
[06:56:47] <CodesStuff> PBDev: Can you toss it up on a jsfiddle for me to mess around with?
[06:57:01] <AdamPDotty> that was close
[06:57:02] <mvk> CodesStuff: http://jsfiddle.net/XPjUy/3/ !! :)
[06:57:02] <PBDev> when slide show ends for the first time (e.g all 5 slides shown), then $('#loading') .hide()
[06:57:06] <PBDev> just a sec
[06:57:28] <PBDev> so do you want what I put in pastebin in jsfiddle
[06:57:31] <CodesStuff> mvk: Scroll up. ajpiano gave you a solution :P
[06:57:43] <CodesStuff> PBdev: Yes, but with all the correct assets and stuff.
[06:57:57] <CodesStuff> I enjoy having testbeds, and it will help with the debugging process.
[06:58:06] <CodesStuff> (Plus others could help as well)
[06:58:36] <docmur_> I have a div being appended with text which is awesome! my code is $('#status').append('<div><p>'+text+'</p></div>');  I want to add a button into the div but when ever I try to I get NaN printed in the div
[06:58:40] <PBDev> thats kinda difficult, since this is in a CMS and there are tons of files. But I can put the important bits
[06:58:42] <docmur_> is there a special way I have to add the button
[06:59:05] <ajpiano> argh
[06:59:50] <mvk> ajpiano: no better way to itterate? :/
[06:59:53] <CodesStuff> YES
[06:59:58] <CodesStuff> Thank god, ajpiano.
[07:00:02] <PBDev> how do you used fiddle. it want save it. I havent used it b4
[07:00:05] <ajpiano> mvk:  what's wrong with that
[07:00:07] <CodesStuff> Wait, did we get him?
[07:00:17] <ajpiano> it's dead simple and actually involves no iteration at all, why do you want to iterate
[07:00:18] <ryanneufeld> wat
[07:00:18] <CodesStuff> God damnit.
[07:00:28] <ajpiano> CodesStuff: apparently i can't write a damn ban, lol
[07:00:54] <tlkr> *!*@66.207.222.14 ?
[07:01:08] <CodesStuff> PBDev: You add the html on the top left, css on the top right, Js in the bottom left. Link to all of the assets using absolute paths
[07:01:36] <PBDev> but I have php in the files cause it is CMS
[07:03:05] <Che-Anarc> If I have an input text element name="choices[]" with onChange="fn(this);"... how can I in fn refer to for example choices[1].text / value?

[07:04:34] <ajpiano> ralphholzmann: ^^
[07:05:51] <CodesStuff> inb4 driveby
[07:06:36] <dpetrek> the site is down? am i just unlucky to find it like this now or does this last for some time now?
[07:06:55] <CodesStuff> Oh look... their private oAuth keys are being output in the debug string
[07:06:57] <CodesStuff> lol.
[07:07:07] <ajpiano> dpetrek: i can get to the website fine, what's the problem
[07:07:26] <dpetrek> ajpiano: try to "Connect to Dropbox"
[07:07:30] <dpetrek> thats where it fails
[07:07:44] <dpetrek> http://sendtodropbox.com/connect
[07:07:44] <ajpiano> oh damn
[07:07:55] <ajpiano> did you tweet at ralph or something
[07:07:57] <dpetrek> no space left on device
[07:08:03] <dpetrek> no didnt, just found it like this now
[07:08:06] <ajpiano> the #jquery channel isn't exactly the best place for reporting issues with it
[07:08:14] <dpetrek> i know, sorry
[07:08:21] <dpetrek> just read there he likes to be here
[07:08:41] <ajpiano> ya
[07:08:44] <ajpiano> i sent him a tweet
[07:09:28] <dpetrek> thanks
[07:09:46] <CodesStuff> The only time I'd see that site being useful (at least for me) is if I didn't have my phone (that has dropbox on it) readily available.
[07:09:59] <docmur_> I'm unsure why this wouldn't work, $('#friendBar').append('<div><p>'+text+$(this).button({icons:{primary: "ui-icon-plusthick"},text: false})+'</p></div>');
[07:10:06] <CodesStuff> The only time I send/read emails is from my phone, but maybe I'm an exception.
[07:10:11] <docmur_> Should that add the button icon next to the text
[07:10:56] <CodesStuff> er..
[07:11:13] <CodesStuff> Is that JQueryUI or something, docmur_?
[07:11:18] <docmur_> yes
[07:11:52] <docmur_> well jQuery + jQueryUI
[07:12:07] <CodesStuff> Hmm.. I'm not familiar with JQUI, but for some reason that doesn't look right.
[07:12:18] <CodesStuff> Can you link me to the documentation for the .button method?
[07:12:26] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm trying to do an ajax post call to a rest service, but for some reason it is not working. can someone please help me
[07:12:27] <pangelovski> http://pastebin.com/LhRQfgZD
[07:12:46] <docmur_> logically shouldn't that append the button after the text with in the div? but the documentation / code reference is here. http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#icons
[07:12:59] <joehannes> does someone know about some special issue with slideUp/slideDown ... ie, when you slideDown, then, before finishing, stop the slideDown Animation in the midst of it, and slideUp again ... for me, the slideUp then is partly broken, flickering
[07:13:28] <CodesStuff> documur_: It looks like you need to create the element first.
[07:13:39] <tlkr> docmur: the button method is enhance existing dom elements with jquery ui theming etc not create them
[07:13:48] <CodesStuff> ^He said it better than me
[07:14:02] <CodesStuff> pangelovski: Which part is failing? The JS or PHP?
[07:14:03] <docmur_> Then just append the element?
[07:14:22] <pangelovski> CodesStuff:
[07:14:25] <docmur_> so do $('create me').... then append that by using a getElementId
[07:14:25] <CodesStuff> docmur_: Yes. Give it a unique ID and select it, THEN apply the icon stuff
[07:14:30] <docmur_> right
[07:14:36] <docmur_> okay I'll try that :-)
[07:14:41] <CodesStuff> well..
[07:15:00] <CodesStuff> docmur_: You're already appending some tags.. why not just toss it in when you do that?
[07:15:09] <pangelovski> CodesStuff: not quite sure, but i think it is the php, since the post name doestn seem to be set
[07:15:13] <CodesStuff> on the append just add <button id="herpderp">lolwat</button
[07:15:32] <CodesStuff> pangelovski: do this: var_dump($_REQUEST);
[07:15:39] <CodesStuff> Tell me if it spits anything out
[07:15:43] <pangelovski> ok thanks
[07:16:16] <CodesStuff> Also, on the .ajax call it looks like you have the return outside of the function itself (line 14)
[07:17:37] <Lurzino> tlkr:  well , removing the else stuff it just continues with another latitude and longitude since the main function is recursive and it works... just I'll have to see when it'll happen reaching the OVER_QUERY_LIMIT status :-)
[07:23:20] <docmur_> that didn't work but here is what I'm trying http://jsfiddle.net/hcS6a/14/
[07:27:10] <tlkr> docmur: did you read what I said above, button does not create a button dom element.
[07:28:00] <docmur_> Oh okay, so then what does the Dom initalization, I just read that message
[07:28:35] <jacta> CodesStuff, seems to work really good - im trying to combine it with greasemonkey/jquery - still no luck though - the thing you made works - now i need it to post to url
[07:29:11] <CodesStuff> jacta: use JSON.stringify(table_array);
[07:29:16] <CodesStuff> Then post that
[07:29:41] <jacta> data: JSON.stringify(table_array); - or data: table_array ?
[07:30:02] <tlkr> docmur: http://jsfiddle.net/hcS6a/17/
[07:30:52] <CodesStuff> jacta: It will convert the array to json for ya. only 1 object though
[07:31:05] <docmur_> Okay
[07:31:11] <docmur_> Thanks :-)
[07:31:53] <jacta> CodesStuff, i get table_array is not defined
[07:32:17] <jacta> my bad-other name
[07:34:30] <jacta> still not- aww
[07:35:28] <CodesStuff> jacta: Just dump the array in there. The one that has the table data in it
[07:35:37] <CodesStuff> I forgot what I called it before
[07:36:51] <DeltaHeavy> Although I have a timeout, jQuery's 'ajax' method sometimes just hangs. Anybody know why this is?
[07:38:26] <jacta> CodesStuff, tried to play with greasemonkey before? its like it wont send my data - ill pastebin it
[07:39:08] <CodesStuff> jacta: i've never used it personally. If I need any sort of extra privledges in the DOM I usually write up an extension.
[07:41:51] <jacta> CodesStuff, for what I can see its not sending it at all- seems like no post it happen http://pastebin.com/6Qxig7uV
[07:42:24] <CodesStuff> oh jacta
[07:42:42] <CodesStuff> do table_data = JSON.stringify(table_data);
[07:42:53] <CodesStuff> I thought that was obvious >_<
[07:42:57] <jacta> but should the post fire anyway though?
[07:43:37] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. It works on the first weekend, so for example checkDate(2) skips to Monday. Whereas checkDate(7) which should skip to the next Monday goes to a Satruday. Weekends should be skipped :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/
[07:44:00] <CodesStuff> jacta: It should. Give me a couple minutes. Helping someone with something else.
[07:44:24] <jacta> sure no prob
[07:44:56] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to create a script that does a count down in days, hours, minutes and seconds from a certain date
[07:44:59] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best?
[07:45:45] <Che-Anarc> How can I refer to specific item intedecies of a type?  eg I have> $('#idSELECT')  I want to update a specific <option> element value and label.
[07:50:30] <docmur_> is there a function that wont add a new line or break and still append information
[07:57:34] <JaredE> if i'm doing $('#lstTribeIDs').append('<option value="'+arrids[i]+'">'+ data[i].label +'</option>'); how can i get the index of what i just appended?
[08:00:11] <anew> this is going to sound like the dumbest question ever... but if i am looking at another site, and edit the js in console with something like console.log('hello') will that appear ?
[08:00:24] <scar> when using nivo or other sliders, is there a way to prevent seeing thingsmove around for a split sec while it gets setup?
[08:00:56] <ralphholzmann> dpetrek: rut roh
[08:01:00] <ralphholzmann> fixing now
[08:01:22] <CodesStuff> jacta: Send me your pastebin again
[08:01:40] <jacta> tried a few ways - ill send what i did
[08:01:59] <CodesStuff> For the record, I'm installing greasemonkey for you ~_~
[08:02:14] <Che-Anarc> http://jsfiddle.net/KCERt/2/  how can I dynamically update Preview List... having a hardtime understanding how I can update specific index of option$('#listPreview') select element.
[08:03:14] <jacta> CodesStuff, http://pastebin.com/qimHQADS  - aww thaaanks
[08:03:29] <jacta> i have loaded http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js into the script
[08:03:47] <CodesStuff> I've never used greasemonkey. How do I set this up/
[08:04:04] <Pilate> install addon, and youre done
[08:04:19] <scar> will .show() throw an error if the target is already showinmg? lol
[08:04:25] <anew> this is going to sound like the dumbest question ever... but if i am looking at another site, and edit the js in console with something like console.log('hello') will that appear ?
[08:04:27] <jacta> CodesStuff, just install - then you get a little monkey icon :p
[08:04:47] <CodesStuff> I know..
[08:04:53] <CodesStuff> Blah. Okay, one sec.
[08:05:31] <jacta> somehow something with my jquery is b0rked i think
[08:06:04] <tlkr> scar no, use $('selector:visible') to check visibility of a dom element.
[08:06:36] <cusco> hi
[08:06:58] <CodesStuff> jacta: How the hell do I add it?
[08:06:59] <CodesStuff> xD
[08:07:08] <cusco> what should I look at to have that effect on <li>'s that.. on hover, show a red cross icon, to remove the <li> ?
[08:07:10] <tlkr> anew it would do assuming the code is run, if it was just in the flow of the page it wouldn't. You could put it inside a function which you can call.
[08:07:15] <scar> jacta k ty
[08:07:21] <jacta> add jquery, or CodesStuff
[08:07:39] <tlkr> that was me scar =[
[08:07:39] <scar> jacta: how can i set the display CSS attribute instead of using .show() ?
[08:07:47] <anew> tlkr so like if i put it inside something that will change a div for example
[08:07:51] <scar> tlkr OOPS haha how can i set the display CSS attribute instead of using .show() ?
[08:07:57] <scar> tlkr: k ty for the commentabove :)
[08:08:13] <tlkr> you could do anew , seems kinda pointless.
[08:08:20] <scar> ?
[08:08:23] <CodesStuff> I keep getting MS scripting errors lmao.
[08:08:37] <tlkr> scar: .css('display', 'block')
[08:08:38] <scar> tlkr: well my problem is things jump around sometimes right b4 sliders load, etc etc-- iwant to hide it with CSS then after loading, show it
[08:08:53] <anew> tlkr if i want to see what objects contain tho ?
[08:09:04] <CodesStuff> oh i see
[08:09:31] <jacta> :o
[08:09:39] <scar> tlkr: http://ulg.alomedia.net/portfolio/branding-marketing-pr/ -- check #pr-slider -- the bxslider wraps it though, and ive tried even the 2 bx divs it wraps it with :\
[08:09:53] <CodesStuff> jacta: what's the target url for this to run?
[08:10:45] <jacta> u got it in pm :)
[08:11:44] <tlkr> anew not sure what you mean
[08:12:41] <anew> like for debugging another website
[08:12:43] <Trudko> guys I am using autocomplete and I need to make sure  that what user types there is something from source
[08:12:59] <Trudko> or at least I need to be able to check if value does exists in the source of that elelment
[08:13:03] <tlkr> jacta: what exactly is the problem? You can't make it display?
[08:19:47] <Trudko> guys I am using autocomplete and I need to make sure  that what user types there is something from source
[08:19:48] <Trudko> or at least I need to be able to check if value does exists in the source of that elelment
[08:21:27] <djsounds02> in my lightbox.js file I have the paths to the loading.gif but I cant seem to get it to find the images without using an absolute path?
[08:22:22] <duc1199> djsounds02: use web inspector to see where it's trying to get the image from
[08:22:44] <duc1199> djsounds02: adjust accordingly. profit!
[08:23:38] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. It works on the first weekend, so for example checkDate(2) skips to Monday. Whereas checkDate(7) which should skip to the next Monday goes to a Satruday. Weekends should be skipped :x http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/
[08:24:12] <djsounds02> I have but its trying to get it from the relative path but thats not working this.fileLoadingImage = '../images/loading.gif';
[08:26:09] <duc1199> fRAiLtY-: it doesn't really check for weekends tho
[08:26:39] <fRAiLtY-> Oh?
[08:27:26] <duc1199> fRAiLtY-: yeah, it only checks for hardcoded array of bank holidays
[08:30:21] <djsounds02> duc1199: ?
[08:31:19] <duc1199> fRAiLtY-: okay i see the part thats supposed to calculate weekends
[08:31:32] <Trudko> guys I am using autocomplete and I need to make sure  that what user types there is something from source or at least I need to be able to check if value does exists in the source of that elelment
[08:34:35] <rmurphey> Trudko: what is your question?
[08:34:45] <fRAiLtY-> duc1199:  Any idea why it doesn't work after the "next" set of weekends
[08:35:41] <Trudko> rmurphey: how to get to source. My problems is that  I need to check  if what users insertet into autocomplete field is value from source , do you know what I mean?>
[08:37:46] <CodesStuff> rmurphey....RUN
[08:44:12] <Trudko> rmurphey: hm?
[08:45:11] <duc1199> fRAiLtY-: Math.floor((days + ((today.getDay() + 1) % 6)) / 7) seems to be the problem
[08:45:49] <fRAiLtY-> Simple fix?
[08:49:19] <npws_marc> hi, so i'm working on this website http://www.nightwatchprotection.com/two-way-voice.php and it's saying $ isn't a function. (it will say it in the console, when hitting the "Click to enter referral info" on the blue form on the right). It doesn't give this error in my demo environment, i just loaded both their code up in vim and did a diff on them and they're both exactly the same, sans url
[08:49:19] <npws_marc> paths changing
[08:49:22] <npws_marc> what could cause this to happen?
[08:49:36] <npws_marc> there's no other jquery's being included on the page either
[08:50:13] <djsounds02> npws_marc: is it a wp site?
[08:50:30] <npws_marc> nope
[08:50:46] <djsounds02> on wordpress you use jQuery rather than &
[08:50:49] <Trudko> ou ok nevermind i can just use closures!!
[08:50:53] <djsounds02> $*
[08:51:12] <pifantastic> npws_marc: use jQuery
[08:51:32] <pifantastic> npws_marc: somewhere jQuery.noConflct() is being called
[08:51:40] <pifantastic> jQuery.noConflict() *
[08:51:55] <npws_marc> let me grep the code and see if it's anywhere
[08:52:53] <shoky> 	var ci = jQuery.noConflict();
[08:53:20] <npws_marc> shoky: is that directed at me? if so, where do you see that
[08:53:27] <shoky> yes
[08:53:34] <shoky> click_matrix.cfm
[08:53:44] <shoky> from tracking.callmeasurement.com
[08:53:52] <npws_marc> sigh
[08:54:18] <pifantastic> yeah that script sucks
[08:55:36] <nFFF> Guys having issues with code running before dom loaded
[08:55:45] <nFFF> its inside, document.ready() any ideas?
[08:55:52] <npws_marc> thanks though
[08:56:02] <npws_marc> i dont even know if we need that anymore
[08:56:05] <fRAiLtY-> Got an odd one, this function should skip weekends and dates within the array. It works on the first weekend, so for example checkDate(2) skips to Monday.

[08:56:05] <npws_marc> time to sort this shit out
[09:00:21] <repair> i have this $("tbody .target").addClass("selected"); which works but i was wondering if i can get the text of cell at same time?
[09:01:15] <quicksilver> $("tbody .target").addClass("selected").text()
[09:01:23] <FrEaKmAn_> i have 2 radio buttons... how can i uncheck them both?
[09:02:21] <repair> like this perhaps? var cells[]+=$("tbody .target").addClass("selected")-text();
[09:02:47] <dthree> FrEaKmAn_:  use some identificator like a class
[09:02:56] <bfgun> hello, i'm having trouble with jquery code doing random things in different places, let me explain: i have a <div id="some">, and i will try to print things inside it. i have a function init() that prints some default things in it
[09:03:04] <FrEaKmAn_> dthree, ?
[09:04:05] <bfgun> i decide to put init() in place A. suddenly things are printed *outside* the div. I decide it to put it in place B: things are printed nowhere. i decide to put it in both A *and* B: things kinda work, then sometimes they appear doubled
[09:05:08] <bfgun> am i guaranteed no javascript will be executed before the page loads wholly?
[09:05:22] <silverwind> No.
[09:05:29] <shoky> hallz naw
[09:05:33] <shoky> hellz*
[09:05:41] <repair> this doesn't seem to work? var tmp;tmp+=$("tbody .target").addClass("selected").text();
[09:05:45] <silverwind> JS is executed when it is "encountered"
[09:06:12] <shoky> repair: concatenation to an undefined var?
[09:06:28] <silverwind> bfgun: That's why $(document).ready(function() { code here }); exists
[09:06:47] <silverwind> bfgun: Or its shorthand $(function() { code here });
[09:07:11] <repair> shoky: i like to get the text of all cells which are marked as selected into a var
[09:07:28] <dthree> FrEaKmAn_:  something like this: $('.class').each(function () { do something with each radio that have this class } I think that is correctly i dont know :p
[09:07:37] <repair> same time as they are marked selected
[09:09:04] <shoky> repair: var target = $('tbody .target').addClass('selected'); var tmp = target.text();   if i understand you correctly
[09:09:43] <repair> what is on target?
[09:10:12] <shoky> wat?
[09:10:16] <repair> indices of all cells marked as selected?
[09:10:43] <repair> var target gets indices of all cells marked as selected?
[09:10:44] <shoky> it's the same as:  var target = $('tbody .target'); target.addClass('selected'); var tmp = target.text();
[09:10:56] <shoky> no indices, dude
[09:11:22] <repair> how can it get the text of correct cell then?
[09:11:22] <shoky> it's a jquery object
[09:11:31] <shoky> what's "correct" :\
[09:11:39] <shoky> you said you want text of all cells that are being marked
[09:11:50] <repair> yes
[09:11:56] <repair> let me try that
[09:12:02] <shoky> that means all 'tbody .target' elements
[09:12:11] <bfgun> silverwind, thanks :)
[09:14:03] <repair> ok, that works
[09:15:20] <Che-Anarc> Can any1 help me with http://jsfiddle.net/KCERt/7/ I dont understand why I get error on 2nd field.
[09:15:54] <repair> how do i get the values separated by comma?
[09:16:13] <repair> target.text() gives one string
[09:16:37] <repair> or can i get them into array?
[09:18:08] <shoky> repair: target.map(function(elem) { return $(elem).text() }).get().join(',')
[09:18:31] <shoky> if you want an array then drop the .join
[09:20:05] <repair> how do i alert the result?
[09:20:10] <shoky> :\
[09:20:21] <repair> alert(target) gives object object
[09:20:29] <shoky> target is not the result..
[09:21:21] <repair> what is then?
[09:21:27] <shoky> the whole expression?
[09:21:40] <shoky> var RESULT = target.map(function(elem) { return $(elem).text() }).get().join(',');
[09:21:41] <shoky> jeez
[09:21:58] <repair> that dosn't work
[09:22:07] <shoky> ?demo @ repair
[09:22:12] <shoky> fack,.
[09:22:24] <docmur_> Is it possible to grab all the buttons with in a <div> and then get the of the button that was pressed?  So I have three buttons, each with an Id of the database ID so if I click the 2nd button I want to know
[09:23:53] <shoky> repair:  ok try  var RESULT = $.map(target,function(elem) { return $(elem).text() }).join(',');
[09:24:11] <shoky> ahhh
[09:24:23] <tlkr> docmur:  $('#divid button').bind('click', function(event) { alert($(event.currentTarget).attr('id')); }
[09:24:47] <shoky> or take what i said before and change it to function(i, elem)
[09:24:47] <repair> ok, that works, thaks dude
[09:24:55] <shoky> stupid jquery :\
[09:26:07] <repair> it doesn't need that join
[09:26:52] <shoky> it does if you want it as a string . if all you're doing is alerting it then sure, you dont need the join..
[09:27:32] <ohcibi> i have add an onSelect callback to my datepicker() options, when i now select a date the input is not updated anymore, whats wrong?
[09:28:17] <repair> this gives an array, what was the command to put one array at the end of another array?
[09:29:12] <shoky> concat
[09:30:03] <repair> or can i do $.map(target,function(elem) { anotherarr[]= $(elem).text() });
[09:30:57] <repair> which would add these values one by one into anotherarr
[09:31:41] <shoky> that doesnt make any sense but ok
[09:32:05] <repair> well anyway it works i test the rest
[09:40:08] <vacho_> guys
[09:40:24] <vacho_> http://pastebin.com/nkwWqcmR
[09:40:35] <vacho_> how can I get the data I am submitting in the "sucess" method
[09:42:37] <Gho5t> submitting?
[09:42:46] <Gho5t> $("#asset-status-form").serialize()
[09:42:56] <Gho5t> receiving? console.log(data);;
[09:43:16] <BillCriswell> vacho_: Yeah, if you want something a little easier to go through you can do $('#asset-status-form').serializeArray();
[09:45:49] <vacho_> BillCriswell: it's submitting the data and everything works just fine. I just want to catch the submitted data in the submit clause (or whatever its called)
[09:46:25] <BillCriswell> Do you want the data that's returned or the data that you're posting?
[09:46:35] <vacho_> BillCriswell: data I am posting.
[09:46:46] <vacho_> BillCriswell: I want to catch one of the form field values
[09:47:03] <docmur_> Hmm I tried that but can't seem to get it working. http://jsfiddle.net/w8SVm/1/
[09:48:16] <BillCriswell> vacho_: So go through the data and return what you'd like.
[09:48:27] <vacho_> how do I go through the data?
[09:48:42] <BillCriswell> $.each
[09:48:43] <vacho_> I have an input field with id="asset_status_id" ......... I want to capture it's value.
[09:48:56] <Gho5t> so do it
[09:49:01] <vacho_> how :D
[09:49:06] <Gho5t> $('#asset_status_id').val()
[09:49:25] <BillCriswell> vacho_: What Gho5t said.
[09:49:33] <vacho_> tghx
[09:49:34] <Gho5t> I'm having trouble discerning if you're confused about jQuery in general or the ajax callback
[09:50:05] <vacho_> what if I want to find it by name?
[09:50:16] <vacho_> <input name='xxx' value='hi' />
[09:50:19] <vacho_> can I find it by name?
[09:50:22] <vacho_> instead of id?
[09:50:22] <BillCriswell> vacho_: Look up attribute selectors.
[09:50:44] <Gho5t> vacho_: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[09:51:00] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ specifically
[09:51:24] <vacho_> thx
[09:55:21] <bakers> What's the best way to find all the elements with a title attr
[09:55:34] <bakers> $("*[title]")
[09:55:37] <bakers> or something?
[09:57:14] <iaj_> Hi there.. which plugin would you recommen if I want to have a well signup form floated/faded in?
[09:58:10] <docmur_> Can anyone see why this code might now work. http://jsfiddle.net/w8SVm/1/
[09:59:27] <Gho5t> yes
[09:59:32] <Gho5t> for one, load jquery in the fiddle
[09:59:37] <Gho5t> for two, use document.ready
[10:00:28] <rmurphey> docmur_: works for me once i select the jquery lib
[10:00:53] <docmur_> ya I forgot that, strange it wont work when I put it in my javascript file, It can bind click but never throws the alert
[10:01:10] <rmurphey> is it in $(document).ready() ?
[10:03:22] <docmur_> Well this would be the test case for the code http://jsfiddle.net/7GtUr/3/
[10:03:53] <chrisbolton> Good morning, I'm doing an AJAX post method and was a little confused on how I select the data to post. Would appreciate some help.
[10:03:56] <rmurphey> why are you returning false?
[10:04:18] <rmurphey> also, you can use $(this) inside your event handler to refer to the button that was clicked
[10:04:23] <sigurding> is anyone of you here using textmate?
[10:05:25] <docmur_> Okay but I still can't figure out why this wont work, it has something to do with the <p> but the <button> is also there so I would assume that it would just look for the button tag, I don't know how else to reference it
[10:06:11] <ravenzz> chrisbolton it is well explained into the documentation :)
[10:07:30] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: I've checked the documentation and it just doesn't seem to have an example of what I'm trying to do. This is what I have so far … http://pastebin.com/1uKWpJkN
[10:07:53] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: Maybe I'm making it more complicated than it needs to be.
[10:08:42] <rmurphey> chrisbolton: see the 'data' property of the options object
[10:09:07] <anew_> what's the point of starting a function with an _ ?
[10:09:08] <ravenzz> chrisbolton success: function (data) { console.debug(data); }
[10:09:21] <anew_> like _categorychange:
[10:09:37] <ravenzz> no point I guess
[10:09:45] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: I'm trying to select data that has been clicked on to hide.
[10:09:45] <rmurphey> docmur_: http://jsfiddle.net/8qVPK/ works fine
[10:09:52] <ravenzz> it might indicate that it is a "private" function
[10:10:00] <chrisbolton> rmurphey: Where do I find that?
[10:10:07] <rmurphey> ?ajax
[10:10:17] <rmurphey> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:10:58] <anew_> thanks
[10:11:13] <anew_> and what about (function (g, h) ... there is a function in this minified jq starting like this... but there is no wrapper to go with it?
[10:11:20] <anew_> the first line in the file is (function (g, h)
[10:11:24] <anew_> shouldnt it be $(function (g, h)
[10:11:42] <rmurphey> only if the intention is for it to run on document ready
[10:11:52] <ravenzz> anew_ no
[10:11:54] <anew_> hmmm i see
[10:12:00] <rmurphey> chances are that the end of the file is }())
[10:12:00] <anew_> so if u dont want it to run on docrdy dont use $
[10:12:08] <rmurphey> so it is likely an "iife"
[10:12:08] <ravenzz> it is done in order to produce an expression
[10:12:17] <ravenzz> or just to wrap it
[10:12:28] <anew_> the end of the file is )(jQuery);
[10:12:53] <rmurphey> anew_: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[10:13:45] <ravenzz> anew_ http://jsfiddle.net/7myfb/
[10:13:46] <anew_> that's pretty good rmurphey thanks
[10:13:59] <chrisbolton> rmurphey: the documentation specifically speaks to the Get request but not to the post.
[10:14:35] <ravenzz> chrisbolton can you explain me what are you trying to do?
[10:14:35] <rmurphey> chrisbolton: argh
[10:14:41] <ravenzz> again :)
[10:14:43] <rmurphey> it works for POST as well
[10:14:47] <rmurphey> why it doesn't say that, i don't know
[10:15:16] <anew_> rmurphey - so it opens the file and starts executing these functions
[10:15:22] <rmurphey> chrisbolton: see the "Sending Data to the Server
[10:15:25] <rmurphey> " heading
[10:15:34] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: I'm trying to select dom elements that have been clicked on to be posted to a specific url.
[10:15:46] <anew_> it says they are immediately invoked... but why immediately invoke and not use document.ready ?
[10:15:54] <rmurphey> long story short, simply set the value of the data property to an object
[10:16:02] <rmurphey> and that object will get sent in the request like form data
[10:16:08] <rmurphey> anew_: read the article :)
[10:16:23] <rmurphey> basically an iife creates a closure
[10:16:39] <rmurphey> the important part isn't the immediate part
[10:16:43] <ravenzz> chrisbolton $('.foo').on('click', function (e) { /* make an ajax request */ }) ?
[10:16:59] <anew_> mmm
[10:17:00] <anew_> ok
[10:17:12] <rmurphey> the important part is using a function to create a closure so you don't end up with global vars
[10:17:34] <anew_> ok last question, the file has certain things like window.Mysite.loader.loaded("jquery-ui/jquery.ui.core.20121001205006.js");
[10:17:43] <anew_> i guess that is to just call other jq files into this one to use ?
[10:18:34] <ravenzz> anew_ you wrap anything within that function, so there won't be variable exposed to the global object (window). Within that function you might want to add a $(document).ready() $(window).load() or whatever you need
[10:18:58] <anew_> ravenzz yeah that's great - no global conflict
[10:19:37] <ravenzz> anew_ that looks like an odd dependency manager
[10:20:14] <anew_> what about window.Mysite.loader.loaded ?
[10:20:20] <ravenzz> like if jquery ui is loaded do something
[10:20:22] <anew_> oh sorry didnt see ur reply ravenzz
[10:20:23] <anew_> ok
[10:20:34] <anew_> hmm i see ok
[10:20:36] <ravenzz> loader should be the dependency manager I guess
[10:20:41] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: Thank you. I'll give it a go to see if I can't figure it out.
[10:23:16] <ravenzz> chrisbolton by the way, if you are dealing with html forms, don't use links to submit and attach an even event handler function for the submit event
[10:24:02] <chrisbolton> ravenzz: Thanks.
[10:24:12] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm trying to post form data to a rest web service but for some reason it works with GET but not POST. anyone else experienced the same?
[10:25:11] <ravenzz> no
[10:25:23] <ravenzz> ?ftjq @ pangelovski
[10:25:49] <ravenzz> uhm
[10:25:51] <ravenzz> pangelovski http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:29:11] <culh> I've come across a new problem: while building a searching tool for he 'keyup' event, I've also included the 'focusin' and 'focusout' events for the same input class. How can I make it work so the 'focusout' event doesn't conflict with the 'keyup' event? This is the code: http://pastebin.com/fT6XDcGM and the 'delay(200)' bit of line 11 is what I didn't want to have to use to make the code wait
[10:29:12] <culh> for the 'keyup' result before the 'focusout' part acts.
[10:29:30] <docmur_> It seems to break when I have my php callback put the buttons in the div, whch makes no sense becuse I'm just echoing back valid HTML,  the echo is  echo '<p>'.$user->firstName.' '.$user->lastName.'<button id="'.$user->id.'">Remove</button></p>'  Which produces the name and button with the information I need
[10:29:44] <docmur_> for some reason jQuery can't access it
[10:29:57] <pangelovski> ravenzz: for some reason my post gets internal error 500, if i try from a chrome rest client plugin it works
[10:30:45] <anew_> ravenzz that fiddle you sent me... if there is no docready how does it load ?
[10:31:43] <ravenzz> andi what fiddle sorry
[10:32:34] <ravenzz> pangelovski if you open the Network tab of the chrome developer tools you will see all the request that your webpage made
[10:32:36] <anew_> http://jsfiddle.net/7myfb/
[10:32:51] <docmur_> got it
[10:33:02] <ravenzz> and you will find the one in question. You can click on it and see the preview, and the error then
[10:33:36] <culh> Any thoughts on my focusout vs. keyup problem?
[10:33:46] <Che-Anarc> If I have a bunch of <labels> with the same class can I update all of their text or must I deal with them individually?
[10:34:04] <ravenzz> anew_ if there is no "docready" it is executed immediately
[10:34:10] <shoky> culh: what exactly is the conflict?
[10:34:21] <anew_> mmm i see
[10:34:55] <ravenzz> anew_ the example was meant to illustrate you the concept of expression (vs function declaration)
[10:35:51] <ravenzz> wrapping the function in parentheses you can use it like an expression, so as condition in a if for example
[10:36:12] <anew_> declaration - executed when called, expression - exectued immediately
[10:36:19] <ravenzz> no
[10:36:48] <anew_> ?
[10:37:21] <ravenzz> functions are invoked immediately when there is a () at the end, eg. var foo = function () { return "ciao"; }();
[10:37:41] <ravenzz> if you alert foo, it will say ciao
[10:37:45] <anew_> and difference between expression & declaration ?
[10:38:06] <ravenzz> anew_ http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
[10:38:26] <anew_> wealth of information here :)
[10:38:29] <ravenzz> eh
[10:38:36] <anew_> what if in the closing parenthesis you put (jQuery); ?
[10:38:39] <BillCriswell> I always think I know javascript till I read stuff like this lol.
[10:39:00] <gnarf> anew_: actually... look up the difference between "function statement" and "function expression" and/or see ?iife
[10:39:02] <ravenzz> anew_ it will provide the function with the jquery object in this case
[10:39:14] <ravenzz> as parameter
[10:39:21] <gnarf> b-ot: g ben alman iife
[10:39:26] <anew_> so if you enclose it in jq it will be executed on docready
[10:39:37] <gnarf> eh - screw you bots... http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[10:39:51] <anew_> heh gnarf thx
[10:40:09] <ravenzz> so you can do (function ($) { $(document).ready(); }(jQuery)); immediately invoked
[10:40:12] <gnarf> anew_: (function( abc ) { })( def );
[10:40:27] <gnarf> anew_: just think about what that says for a sec :)
[10:40:39] <anew_> wut... ravenzz how is that immediately invoked there is docready and jquery
[10:40:42] <pangelovski> ravenzz: can you please give it a try. http://pangelovski.mine.nu/phonegap/fastigheter/www/#page_apartment_details
[10:40:55] <anew_> gnarf def = ?
[10:41:05] <gnarf> you are executing that function with "def" as a parameter right?
[10:41:10] <gnarf> anew_: a random var name
[10:41:19] <gnarf> anew_: no more meaningful than "foo" or "bar"
[10:41:28] <anew_> ah
[10:41:38] <gnarf> anew_: var f = function( abc ) { }; f(def);
[10:41:48] <gnarf> anew_: that code ^^^ and the IIFE a few lines ago are equal
[10:41:57] <gnarf> aside from the IIFE doesn't use a var... but yeah
[10:42:03] <gnarf> effect is the same
[10:42:11] <anew_> yeah i see that
[10:42:26] <anew_> what about (function( abc ) { })( jQuery );
[10:42:27] <someprimetime> ravenzz: that's kind of a weird example for immediately invoking a function like doc ready
[10:42:28] <gnarf> so, the jQuery pattern of doing (function($) { })(jQuery); is a way to make sure that inside of the {} of the IIFE, $ === jQuery
[10:42:51] <anew_> hmmm
[10:42:53] <anew_> but there is no $
[10:43:23] <gnarf> anew_: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/src/jquery.requestAnimationFrame.js
[10:43:24] <someprimetime> wait i didn't see it being wrapped to $
[10:43:29] <someprimetime> carry on
[10:43:51] <gnarf> note that (function($){ starts the code, and })(jQuery); ends it
[10:44:08] <anew_> right
[10:44:16] <gnarf> references to $ inside the that IIFE are pointing at jQuery
[10:44:28] <anew_> what if it was (fuction(a, b){})(jQuery);
[10:44:36] <gnarf> a === jQuery, b === undefined
[10:44:43] <anew_> interesting
[10:44:46] <anew_> mind blown
[10:45:12] <gnarf> there are a few reasons for using IIFEs like this
[10:45:15] <anew_> mind BLOWN
[10:45:35] <gnarf> #1: inside a function, all vars are "scoped" to that function, so by enclosing everything in an IIFE, you give yourself a "private scope"
[10:45:59] <ravenzz> ansimation hope this help http://jsfiddle.net/RWp5c/
[10:46:04] <ravenzz> ops
[10:46:07] <ravenzz> anew_ http://jsfiddle.net/RWp5c/
[10:46:52] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: Why does that only alert once?
[10:47:06] <ravenzz> anew = jQuery
[10:47:16] <BillCriswell> Oh, error.
[10:47:21] <anew_> awesome
[10:47:24] <ravenzz> BillCriswell because foo is defined within that function
[10:47:30] <culh> http://pastebin.com/4CENMQua  // line 11. has a delay() call that forces the code to wait for the 'click' portion (line 36.+) to finish before emptying the input val(). How can I work this conflict without having to guess how long all browsers would have to 'delay'?
[10:47:35] <ravenzz> and the concept of closure
[10:47:40] <anew_> is .prototype  reserved for anything ?
[10:47:43] <gnarf> ravenzz: no closures there
[10:48:11] <ravenzz> oh well maybe I am wrong
[10:48:16] <ravenzz> then
[10:48:33] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: I understood why the first one was going off, but didn't understand why the second one wasn't. I guess it doesn't just 'undefined'
[10:48:35] <gnarf> ravenzz: "closure" generally refers to a function that returns a function
[10:48:50] <ravenzz> well how do you call that then?
[10:48:56] <gnarf> BillCriswell / ravenzz: this is why console.log is better than alert, always
[10:49:07] <ravenzz> oh yes
[10:49:16] <gnarf> ravenzz: IIFE -- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
[10:49:32] <someprimetime> gnarf: wouldn't that be a callback?
[10:49:39] <gnarf> pronounced kinda like "if eee"
[10:49:52] <ravenzz> yes but that is a feature of non IIFE functions as well
[10:50:08] <someprimetime> a closure just has limited variable scope to that specific function
[10:50:32] <ravenzz> oh scope
[10:50:33] <ravenzz> lol
[10:50:36] <gnarf> function closure( i ) { return function() { console.log( i ); }; }
[10:50:37] <ravenzz> that one
[10:50:42] <ravenzz> soooorry
[10:50:46] <ravenzz> I meant scope :)
[10:51:31] <BillCriswell> I think I understand closures but I couldn't explain them to save my life... which would mean I don't understand them probably haha.
[10:51:43] <jle2002> hey
[10:51:52] <jle2002>  who one the debates last night
[10:52:04] <anew_> is .prototype reserved for anything ?
[10:52:08] <pangelovski> so i fixed it. turns out i was following guides on the internet that were saying that you need to serialise the form data before doing a POST. I guess that is not true :)
[10:52:18] <koden> I know this isn't really a Jquery problem but I am trying to think of a work around for my problem using jquery.
[10:52:29] <jle2002> hey
[10:53:03] <gnarf> anew_: prototype is super speical
[10:53:08] <koden> In IE browsers for some reason URLS with hash tags are only linking to the top of the page instead of going to the correct section.
[10:53:32] <ravenzz> pangelovski eh it might be handy
[10:53:39] <anew_> gnarf with a period ?
[10:53:41] <koden> using any IE browser, go to http://www.hr.ufl.edu/benefits/openenrollment/#ufselect and click on any of the links in the right column to see what I am talking about
[10:53:41] <anew_> .prototype
[10:53:44] <gnarf> if an object doesn't have a property defined on itself, it will check its constructors prototype property to get the "default"
[10:54:00] <anew_> so like e.mine.prototype
[10:54:01] <pangelovski> ravenzz: the thing is, doing a get you need to serialise form data. however doing a post you don't need to
[10:54:14] <anew_> prototype will add properties
[10:54:17] <gnarf> anew_: if ".mine" is a function, .prototype makes sense
[10:54:30] <gnarf> either way
[10:54:43] <gnarf> anew_: BillCriswell, others http://eloquentjavascript.net - chapter 3
[10:54:47] <ravenzz> pangelovski you can serialize and unserialize (server-side) in both casese
[10:54:49] <ravenzz> -e
[10:55:06] <gnarf> anew_: consider / run this on your console:
[10:55:16] <black_warlock> who can help me parsing xml file ?
[10:55:21] <black_warlock> via JQ
[10:55:32] <ravenzz> pangelovski so you don't have to prepare the form data by hand, one by one
[10:55:58] <lihan> i'm getting some test failures on master in chrome, anyone else having this problem? (no extensions installed)
[10:56:04] <pangelovski> ravenzz: i know. i was just confused with the serialise and the form method is all
[10:56:20] <pangelovski> ravezz: two days i have sat with this
[10:56:28] <Soopaman> is anyone here able to develop touch-aware webapps using their mac touchpad to simulate input?
[10:56:42] <resno> im having a weird issue, on page, my script works. but when i seperate itinto its ownpage it stops working
[10:56:52] <ravenzz> eheh it's ok, just learn how to debug your code...it will save you a lot of time
[10:58:27] <gnarf> anew_: http://jsbin.com/upeyof/1/edit
[11:00:13] <culh> Ok let me break it down a little: how to I check if a child element hasn't been clicked from a focusout call of a parent element?
[11:02:20] <codephobic> hi
[11:02:21] <someprimetime> culh: set a data attribute when it has been and remove it when it's not
[11:02:32] <dshap> anyone know why $('#someTable').css('height', 200) would work in Firefox but not in Chrome?  in Firefox the height changes but in chrome nothing happens...
[11:03:11] <codephobic> hi,
[11:03:44] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Thanks for the link bud.
[11:04:01] <gnarf> BillCriswell: that book is super useful, read it twice
[11:04:05] <codephobic> I'm fairly new to js and jquery and I've cobbled together a working ajax script which adds elements from a menu to a "order" list
[11:04:16] <codephobic> it is triggered by onclick functions
[11:04:39] <codephobic> this works perfectly well in chrome, firefox, safari and across mobiles but not with IE.
[11:05:06] <NoiseEee> ?demo @ codephobic
[11:05:16] <gnarf> codephobic: welcome to web development
[11:05:26] <gnarf> codephobic: if you are using "onclick" you aren't using jQuery
[11:05:55] <anew_> gnarf i still dont get what .prototype does there ?
[11:06:16] <codephobic> The complication arises for me in that, when I googled this problem, the solution (addEventListener...) only dealt with a single item, whereas my menu is dynamically generated from a jQuery AJAX call to a php/mysql page
[11:06:25] <gnarf> anew_: read eloquent
[11:06:51] <NoiseEee> codephobic: even addEventListener isn't jquery.  please post your sample code
[11:06:53] <codephobic> NoiseEee, sorry I don't quite get what you mean? you want to see the code?
[11:06:58] <codephobic> oh
[11:06:59] <codephobic> k
[11:07:03] <NoiseEee> codephobic: or preferably a demo @ jsfiddle
[11:07:14] <gnarf> codephobic: onclick is the devil
[11:07:16] <codephobic> ok, I'll go log in and do that
[11:07:24] <codephobic> gnarf, so I see :S
[11:07:30] <gnarf> codephobic: if you're in #jquery - you're looking for a jquery solution
[11:07:38] <gnarf> are you even including jquery.js yet?
[11:07:47] <anew_> k
[11:08:12] <codephobic> gnarf, the thing is, I needed to use a bit of js because I wanted to make sure I understood what I was doing... It really made sense to me ... until IE happened.
[11:08:21] <gnarf> codephobic: sure
[11:08:29] <gnarf> codephobic: jquery IS javascript you know
[11:09:56] <gnarf> to bind a function on click you'd do something like jQuery( cssSelector ).click( handler ); in your own .js file that you include after jquery
[11:10:17] <gnarf> also http://jqfundamentals.com/
[11:11:08] <culh> someprimetime: i'm putting the 'click' event inside the 'focusout' event, to try and workaround this but with no progress
[11:11:41] <someprimetime> jsfiddle?
[11:12:03] <gnarf> culh: binding events inside other events is rarely what you want...
[11:12:03] <BillCriswell> I love being able to load a whole book on one HTML page.
[11:13:04] <hlve> BillCriswell, if you ever wrote a book, I'd read it
[11:13:31] <hlve> SomeoneWeird, http://jsfiddle.net
[11:14:10] <BillCriswell> hlve: If I ever wrote a book it definitely would not be on JavaScript haha. thanks though!
[11:14:42] <hlve> lolll
[11:14:51] <BillCriswell> It would not be on JavaScript because I don't understand it well enough, not that I don't like it. =)
[11:15:01] <hlve> Did you end up seeing the final product of that pagination crap?
[11:15:21] <BillCriswell> hlve: I do not think you showed me.
[11:15:28] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/20/
[11:15:29] <hlve> Horay!
[11:15:53] <codephobic> NoiseEee, hopefully this works: http://jsfiddle.net/codephobic/6nCTN/
[11:16:17] <BillCriswell> I'm very glad you wrapped the news items up.
[11:16:27] <hlve> BillCriswell, thanks again for the help with that.
[11:16:39] <hlve> codephobic: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/6nCTN/1/
[11:16:50] <hlve> you didn't load jquery in your link ;P
[11:16:54] <codephobic> gnarf, I know jQuery is js but with a lot of custom written functions and 'tools' ... I thought I might as well learn the basics (js) too.
[11:16:57] <BillCriswell> hlve: No problem at all.
[11:17:31] <npws_marc> so, i've got a script that does $('form').submit(function () {..}); and stops submission to validate the form, but when i try to submit the form with .submit() it's just going into a recursive loop... now.. i do this same thing on other sites and it works, why causes this?
[11:17:31] <BillCriswell> codephobic: I was just introduced to this, great so far: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[11:17:39] <npws_marc> i'm using event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault
[11:17:54] <NoiseEee> codephobic: you should be using jquery throughout for ideal results; your code is unnecessarily wordy
[11:18:05] <codephobic> BillCriswell, yeah, I've been reading that and a few other js resources online - it's how I cobbled together my cart thing.
[11:18:20] <Cork> npws_marc: run .submit() on the dom element, not the jquery one
[11:18:21] <BillCriswell> The guy who created javascript wrote a review on it? Bad ass.
[11:18:27] <Cork> npws_marc: this.submit()
[11:18:31] <npws_marc> okay
[11:18:31] <hlve> lol
[11:19:02] <toter> Hi… How do I apply the same page scrolling animation used in the sidebar to the "Top" link located in the top right corner of this page? http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/embedded/result/
[11:19:10] <npws_marc> this.submit is not a function
[11:19:23] <Cork> npws_marc: is this the form?
[11:19:47] <Cork> else try $('form')[0].submit()
[11:19:50] <codephobic> hlve, I've not used jsFiddle much, so not got the hang of it at all I guess. I thought I was just meant to paste in my js/jq and html?
[11:19:53] <NoiseEee> codephobic: you want to use .on() instead of .click(),  and assign it to a parent.  $('#parentOfEverythingWithSectionsClass').on('click','.sections',function(ev) { //hey, anything added to the container will fire this, even if its dynamically loaded!! } );
[11:20:00] <toter> BillCriswell: Thanks again for your help yesterday. Everything is working smoothly now...
[11:20:10] <BillCriswell> toter: Was it the utf-8 stuff?
[11:20:21] <hlve> codephobic: I fixed it in my link. The left bar lets you enable jquery/other frameworks
[11:20:37] <drummer306> if I am loading a form via ajax, how do I get the validation to kick off ?  I'm using document.ready, should I be using something else /
[11:20:40] <drummer306> like live ?
[11:20:43] <hlve> your code though, someone else needs to debug that. It's broke :3
[11:20:49] <toter> BillCriswell: The latest query, 1.8.2, was breaking the scroll spy feature and also the animation
[11:20:55] <toter> query=jquery
[11:20:57] <MistuhKurtz> toter, $('a.top').click(function(){ $('html, body').animate({'scrollTop': 0}, 500);
[11:21:07] <toter> MistuhKurtz: thanks
[11:21:13] <MistuhKurtz> er forgot a closing }); but you get the idea
[11:21:28] <xec> you can do $('form').submit() too
[11:22:04] <Cork> xec: no that will trigger the event listener
[11:22:06] <Cork> not the submit
[11:22:24] <culh> gnarf: I'm clearing a text input after using it's value on a 'click' event, but at the same time I'm clearing that input value after a 'focusout' event. i need some sort of flag or value to check, since I can't seem to find a jQ built in function that checks if this child text has been clicked before clearing the text input
[11:23:49] <codephobic> NoiseEee, so if I assign the on('click', function...) to the parent section, each item that's clicked will still bring up it's own data, rather than the global or parent version of 'id'/'dish' etc? (this is my very first stab at jq/js so, trying to get my head around things like scope and context...)
[11:24:33] <xec> Cork: are you sure? just tested in a fiddle and seems to work fine
[11:24:48] <NoiseEee> codephobic: its more about your issue (if i understood correctly) of dynamic items ('.sections') not firing their event handlers when they are newly added... you just look for the event on the container and use bubbling
[11:25:08] <gnarf> culh: so the focusout happens before the click happens unless you are clicking on the same thing
[11:25:18] <Cork> xec: $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); .... if() { this.submit(); } });
[11:25:45] <Cork> xec: if you run $(this).submit() you trigger the event listener again, and end up in an infinite loop
[11:26:41] <xec> ah, i jumped in a bit late, didn't realize there was a listener too
[11:26:59] <culh> gnarf: it's not the same thing. but it's conflicted somehow becouse the focusout event happends when the click event happends.
[11:27:09] <xec> realise?
[11:27:12] <codephobic> NoiseEee, my issue is specifically with Internet Explorer (from what I've googled), I'll go try out your suggestion (I'm sure it will work, give that it's jQuery - the onclick event is messed up in IE because they handle js differently in IE, apparently).
[11:28:07] <NoiseEee> codephobic: at what point/  what part of the code is IE having trouble with?
[11:28:59] <toter> MistuhKurtz: I'm afraid it is still not working. I added the code you provided… http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/1/embedded/result/
[11:29:16] <codephobic> NoiseEee, it has trouble with the onclick='addItem(this.id)' - that is dynamically set within my jQuery
[11:29:40] <codephobic> addItem() doesn't fire in IE (or at least it looks like it doesn't fire).
[11:29:53] <NoiseEee> codephobic: don't use onclick.  don't use ANY inline JS.
[11:30:11] <le_gars> hello are you not supposed to be able to do this? var colour = "#312D27"; var test = "div";  $(test).css(colour); and then the div would have the colour?
[11:30:12] <pangelovski> hi guys, when creating collapsible content the theming is not applied, is there a way to refresh.
[11:30:17] <gnarf> culh: focusout happens first
[11:30:22] <gnarf> culh: because you clicked somewhere
[11:30:24] <gnarf> you lost focus
[11:30:25] <gnarf> then click
[11:30:29] <NoiseEee> if you want something to happen on a click, use something like $('.particularClassName').on('click',function() { //do stuff }) @ codephobic
[11:30:44] <toter> MistuhKurtz: Sorry… http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/2/embedded/result/
[11:30:55] <NoiseEee> codephobic: so in your case, take that onclick stuff OUT, and then use .on() on its container so that newly added elements fire what you want
[11:31:11] <gnarf> culh: sounds like a bad UX to me either way to clear an input on focusout
[11:31:13] <codephobic> NoiseEee, I'll give that a go.
[11:31:23] <NoiseEee> codephobic: good luck!
[11:31:28] <codephobic> NoiseEee, thanks.
[11:31:38] <NoiseEee> codephobic: any time you're thinking / coming across inline JS, get rid of it
[11:31:47] <jugstah> anyone got a clue on jquery tools with the tabs+slideshow stuff
[11:31:49] <NoiseEee> codephobic: in the same way you'd get rid of <FONT> tags these days
[11:31:50] <jugstah> ?
[11:32:39] <codephobic> NoiseEee, it just seemed convenient to write it inline ... didn't see a problem until I tested the page in IE. Learnt a lesson, I guess.
[11:33:31] <NoiseEee> codephobic: not to mention it is nowhere as flexible
[11:33:55] <MistuhKurtz> toter, you need to isolate your problem a bit more and create a jsfiddle that's easier to work with
[11:34:00] <NoiseEee> codephobic: you never know when you need to stop/ignore/change an event handler, for example.  or dynamically add elements that need similar handlers, etc
[11:34:04] <MistuhKurtz> instead of pasting all of your code in the HTML pane, only put your HTML there
[11:34:15] <MistuhKurtz> and add your javascript in the JS pane
[11:34:31] <toter> MistuhKurtz: ok
[11:34:32] <codephobic> NoiseEee, can't I just assign .on('click', ...) to the actual element's class instead of going for the parent? Since this is a button within a li that is itself responding to a click, maybe less complicated?
[11:35:08] <MistuhKurtz> and isolate it, remove stuff not necessary to debugging
[11:35:32] <MistuhKurtz> also, you're already binding a click event to all a tags
[11:35:32] <NoiseEee> codephobic: you could for sure, but since that element is getting added after initial page load (from what I can tell), then anything with the class you want that ISN'T there on DOMReady/pageload is not goign to be included
[11:35:50] <MistuhKurtz> you need to be more specific with your selector, i.e. $(".nav a") instead of just $("a")
[11:36:49] <codephobic> NoiseEee, good to know, I was asking more for enlightenment than anything else. Thanks. Hopefully this will be quick and painless.
[11:37:11] <culh> gnarf: I'm using delay() to make this work, but I wish I didn't have to.
[11:37:12] <NoiseEee> codephobic: by using bubbling, you can have a single .on() call that will work with all elements, anytime.  $('ul.certainClass').on('click','button',function() {});   <--- all buttons in any child of that UL (ie: newly added <li>s that hold buttons) will fire
[11:38:16] <gnarf> culh: heh
[11:38:26] <toter> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/6/embedded/result/
[11:38:33] <gnarf> culh: that seems unlikely to help, but okay :)
[11:38:44] <Guiixandy> hi

[11:38:45] <bot-t> culh, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[11:39:03] <Guiixandy> where have exercices to javascript?
[11:39:12] <gnarf> ?101 @Guiixandy
[11:39:12] <bot-t> Guiixandy, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:39:20] <gnarf> ?learn @Guiixandy
[11:39:21] <bot-t> Guiixandy, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:39:38] <rgr> whats the syntax for combining attr checks normal regexp rules? e.g simpilify $('a[href^="http"]:visible,a[href^="https"]:visible,a[href^="www"]:visible')
[11:40:14] <culh> gnarf: I've gotta run, thanks for the help. maybe some time off this will bring me some clarity.
[11:40:18] <toter> MistuhKurtz: The code you provided is in the end of the file
[11:40:50] <MistuhKurtz> toter, javascript should be in the lower left-hand pane: http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/6/light/
[11:41:30] <Eviltwin> rgr: You know a[href^="http"] includes everything included by a[href^="https"], right?
[11:41:46] <Eviltwin> And that <a href="www.google.com">x</a> is not an external link
[11:42:05] <MistuhKurtz> also, I need the 'top' link positioned in a way that I can edit and debug right there in that view
[11:42:12] <MistuhKurtz> possibly add position:fixed; to it
[11:42:57] <toter> MistuhKurtz: I'm sorry… I'm using Jquery and Bootstrap. The animation is working, it's not working only on the "Top" link. All references to .js are there
[11:43:13] <MistuhKurtz> toter I'm trying to explain to you how you can make it easier for others to help you
[11:44:36] <rgr> Eviltwin: yes I knew that. sorry playing.  but anyway can I combine http and www for example?
[11:45:27] <Cork> rgr: just check for http://
[11:45:31] <toter> MistuhKurtz: How about this? http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/7/embedded/result/
[11:45:43] <rgr> its an example. I want to check for multiple things.
[11:46:05] <Cork> rgr: just make multiple selectors
[11:46:10] <Cork> (comma separated)
[11:46:20] <Eviltwin> These are the attribute selectors: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[11:46:29] <jugstah> a query for comments: other than jquery-ui, what's the best jquery tab+slideshow app out there?
[11:46:32] <rgr> lets pretend I said a[href^="aaa"]:visible,a[href^="bbb"]:visible,a[href^="ccc"]:visible
[11:46:44] <Eviltwin> There's not a good way to express starts with http or starts with www without separate selectors like you have
[11:46:55] <Eviltwin> Unless you want to dip back into JavaScript land
[11:47:00] <MistuhKurtz> toter, you still have another click event bound to all "a" elements
[11:47:04] <MistuhKurtz> and it's failing b/c of that
[11:47:13] <MistuhKurtz> You should move all of your JS inside that jS pane
[11:47:19] <Guiixandy> is possible use javascript with python?
[11:47:25] <rgr> ok, Im surprised theres not a regexp composition. I'll use seperate selectors for now.
[11:47:35] <toter> MistuhKurtz: Got it. I'll do that
[11:47:36] <Cork> Guiixandy: you mean javascript IN python?
[11:47:42] <Guiixandy> yes
[11:47:58] <Guiixandy> Cork: is possible?
[11:48:01] <Cork> ya, there are a few interpreters for python
[11:48:42] <Cork> i don't have a suggestion for which is the best though
[11:49:08] <toter> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/8/
[11:51:40] <MistuhKurtz> toter, http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/9/
[11:52:38] <Guiixandy> You use PHP?
[11:53:11] <Guiixandy> Sorry, I'm new in the mIRC and programmer 2 years only
[11:53:19] <toter> MistuhKurtz: Wow… Thank you very much.
[11:54:00] <Cork> Guiixandy: google python exeute javascript
[11:54:20] <Cork> you should get a few hits, but basically it all comes down to v8 or spidermonkey
[11:55:58] <toter> MistuhKurtz: One question though… When you open the page… http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/9/embedded/result/... You click on "Hero 1" and then click on "Top", the animation gets a little glitchy… Did you notice that?
[11:56:53] <Demonen> I'm dynamically loading some javaScript as-needed, using $.getScript(), and I'd like to do similar things with CSS.  How can I do that?  I mean, I can load a html block with <style/> in it, I guess, but i'd rather laod a .css and apply it to DOM automagically, if possible.
[11:56:55] <codephobic> NoiseEee, thanks, I'm halfway there to fixing my f-up, I think.
[11:56:56] <hlve> i didn't see anything wrong with that
[11:57:10] <MistuhKurtz> forgot to prevent default even toter: http://jsfiddle.net/rzGBn/10/
[11:57:38] <Cork> Demonen: if you compress your css, your actually losing performance by loading it that way
[11:57:57] <toter> MistuhKurtz: Man… Working smoothly now… Thanks again!
[11:57:58] <Cork> just have one big css file for and pick what you need through classes
[11:57:59] <someprimetime> Cork: source?
[11:58:03] <MistuhKurtz>  np
[11:58:19] <codephobic> NoiseEee, Is it wise to use getAttribute to grab the data-xxx attributes I set or should I be looking for some other means of passing data into the function I'm putting together?
[11:58:23] <Cork> someprimetime: do a simple calculation of the tcp overhead
[11:58:23] <black_warlock> why this doesnt work
[11:58:30] <black_warlock> guys help >>>> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/yygp7/10/
[11:58:33] <Demonen> Cork: It's not about performance, it's about flexibility :)
[11:58:37] <black_warlock> why not working
[11:58:47] <someprimetime> Cork: but why?
[11:58:51] <someprimetime> what causes the decrease
[11:58:56] <Cork> someprimetime: if you don't split it up, you get one load and then its in cache (and it isn't dropped cause you use it frequently)
[11:58:57] <someprimetime> and why would having whitespace help
[11:59:21] <Cork> if you load it in section you will have multiple connections to load the page (and that will delay the load)
[11:59:39] <Demonen> Yes, that's webhosting 101, I know all that
[11:59:45] <Cork> and you will have a high rist of getting evicted from the cache and there by loading it over the net again
[11:59:56] <hlve> black_warlock: your JS is hitting a breaking point
[12:00:11] <Demonen> Still, the page has several "modules", and they all have their own (optional) CSS file.
[12:00:15] <Cork> Demonen: only way to load css is through injecting tags in the page
[12:00:17] <black_warlock> the js console says listEvents not defined
[12:00:17] <Demonen> Is it possible or not?
[12:00:20] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/yygp7/12/
[12:00:22] <Cork> preferably links in the head
[12:00:31] <hlve> black_warlock ^
[12:00:36] <Cork> Demonen: but that will trigger a reflow of the entire page every time to you do it
[12:00:38] <hlve> *fixed*
[12:00:50] <Cork> aka. a really bad idea
[12:01:03] <Cork> Demonen: you should handle your code management server side
[12:01:04] <black_warlock> hive
[12:01:08] <hlve> suo?
[12:01:09] <Cork> theres loads of tools for that
[12:01:11] <black_warlock> why didnt you put js on js area?
[12:01:20] <Cork> Demonen: and that does it without adding load cost
[12:01:36] <NoiseEee> codephobic: use jquery's .attr() function
[12:01:41] <hlve> the JS is loading after your body loads, so your body on load was calling for a listEvents  which didn't exist yet
[12:02:02] <hlve> dat dom.
[12:02:08] <Demonen> Cork: Yeah, but that's not always possible, is it?
[12:02:10] <black_warlock> ahhh
[12:02:12] <black_warlock> but
[12:02:16] <codephobic> NoiseEee, thanks
[12:02:28] <black_warlock> i have setted also a button that recall the listEvents() function
[12:02:33] <Demonen> Cork: In a perfect world I'd do things "the right way", but sometimes rather unsavoury hacks are needed.
[12:02:40] <black_warlock> and it doesnt work anyway
[12:02:44] <hlve> black_warlock, it was hitting a breaking point.
[12:02:45] <hlve> one sec.
[12:02:47] <Demonen> I mean, there's a reason I've never come across this "problem" before.
[12:02:58] <black_warlock> what does mean
[12:04:08] <hlve> black_warlock: fixing it. one sec.
[12:05:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[12:08:34] <toter> Does anyone know if it's possible to change the tab indent size on google code prettify?
[12:09:04] <hlve> ah black_warlock, I don't really know why that's not working...
[12:11:15] <Servercrash> how do i apply the modified css (using jquery) to newly added element in the dom
[12:11:47] <Servercrash> the modified css is only applied to existing element, but if element is dynamically added later, the modified css is not applied, instead default css gets applied
[12:12:57] <pangelovski> hi guys, i have a collapsible div however when binding events to it, i cannot reach it
[12:13:32] <black_warlock> hahaha
[12:13:41] <black_warlock> it sux lol
[12:14:20] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: what kind of events?
[12:14:30] <pangelovski> collapse expand
[12:15:06] <pangelovski> eddiemonge: http://pangelovski.mine.nu/phonegap/fastigheter/www/#page_apartment_details
[12:16:07] <defaultro_> hey folks, I can't get Math.round to work
[12:16:29] <defaultro_> $("#speed").val($("#speed").val() * 1.609).Math.round() ;
[12:16:45] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: can you pull out the relative code since theres a lot?
[12:17:04] <defaultro_> and also, what's the better way to write that since I am repeating #speed inside?
[12:17:06] <defaultro_> $(this).val() didn't work
[12:17:11] <pangelovski> http://pastebin.com/ACTtGaQs
[12:17:21] <eddiemonge> ?val @ defaultro_
[12:17:24] <Soopaman> anyone here have any tips on abstracted memoization techniques?
[12:17:54] <eddiemonge> hmm been awhile. defaultro_ http://api.jquery.com/val/#val2
[12:18:17] <defaultro_> k
[12:18:33] <pangelovski> eddiemonge: i have a collapsible div in my page, and when the user expands/collapses it, the event listener should kick in
[12:19:23] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: are you creating the event for it or are you relying on something in jqm?
[12:20:35] <pangelovski> yes
[12:20:38] <defaultro_> my code is almost the same
[12:20:50] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: yes?
[12:20:52] <defaultro_> but how do we rewrite this one, "#speed").val() * 1.609
[12:20:55] <pangelovski> sorry
[12:21:11] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: what is it you are trying to do?
[12:21:13] <pangelovski> i misread it, i have created a bind event for the collapsible div

[12:22:16] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: i mean you arent triggering an expand/collapse event. so listening for those wont do anything
[12:22:58] <pangelovski> eddiemonge: but when i click on the div, shouldn't jqm be handling the trigger event?
[12:23:25] <pangelovski> eddiemonge: i am following this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/238/
[12:24:27] <codephobic> NoiseEee, I just tested the changed script in IE, sadly it's still not working.
[12:24:48] <codephobic> It works perfectly well in firefox and Chrome (and Iceweasel too)
[12:24:57] <codephobic> both in Ubuntu and Windows 7
[12:25:17] <codephobic> but when I try to get the button firing in IE9 ... nothing.
[12:25:20] <hlve> defaultro          --> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/vQD2f/
[12:25:28] <hlve> ;P
[12:25:40] <defaultro_> eddiemonge: here is my code, http://jsfiddle.net/M422n/
[12:25:42] <NoiseEee> codephobic: paste what you've got again, and what you mean by 'not working'
[12:26:08] <defaultro_> eddiemonge: I don't like this code, $("#speed").val($("#speed").val() / 1.609);
[12:26:19] <defaultro_> I don't like repetive class
[12:26:24] <defaultro_> repetitive
[12:26:35] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/M422n/1/
[12:26:40] <hlve> works just fine o.o
[12:27:20] <defaultro_> it works
[12:27:27] <defaultro_> let me see your changes
[12:28:02] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: http://jsfiddle.net/M422n/7/
[12:28:28] <hlve> Just adding quotations around the number you're multiplying
[12:28:50] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: Just be careful, .val() returns a string... Might want to do parseInt( val, 10 )
[12:29:00] <defaultro_> oh ok
[12:29:32] <codephobic> NoiseEee, http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/6nCTN/1/
[12:29:57] <codephobic> NoiseEee, by not working, I mean that IE does not fire off any events as a result of clicking the "buy" button.
[12:30:25] <defaultro_> BillCriswell: what is the 2nd param for?
[12:30:58] <codephobic> aaaaand just like that it IS working :S
[12:31:09] <codephobic> I did a Ctrl+F5
[12:31:10] <BillCriswell> The numeral system to use.
[12:31:21] <pangelovski> eddiemonge: did you have any luck?
[12:31:27] <codephobic> it should have cleared cache, but for some reason it wasn't cleared up
[12:31:38] <eddiemonge> pangelovski: is your html structured the same way?
[12:31:39] <codephobic> NoiseEee, thanks, looks like you solved it!
[12:31:48] <NoiseEee> codephobic: great
[12:31:53] <codephobic> :)
[12:32:25] <NoiseEee> codephobic: next up.... replace all that document.getElementById(b).getAttribute("whatevs")  with  $(b).attr('whatevs')
[12:32:36] <NoiseEee> codephobic: since you're using jquery, use jquery, you know :)
[12:33:07] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: cleaned up: http://jsfiddle.net/M422n/14/
[12:33:13] <codephobic> lol, will do.
[12:33:16] <defaultro_> cool
[12:33:44] <BillCriswell> defaultro_: '08' + 2 = '082', parseInt('08') + 2 = 2, parseInt('08', 10) + 2 = 10
[12:33:45] <eddiemonge> NoiseEee: whats wrong with pure JS? other than the cross browser bugs?
[12:34:09] <codephobic> to be honest, I just wanted to be able to do stuff in regular js too. I think I can live with being able to make something that works in most browser, in js and something that works in nearly all (can't be absolute, I guess) in jQuery.
[12:34:09] <NoiseEee> eddiemonge: nothing is 'wrong' with it, but it does make code unwieldly/long/etc, especially when you're already using jquery
[12:34:36] <NoiseEee> codephobic: i appreciate it, but its not worth the extra coding and testing
[12:34:48] <NoiseEee> codephobic: learn natural JS by building some natural JS apps, etc
[12:35:02] <NoiseEee> codephobic: but when you're using jquery to do something, use it throughout. consistency matters.
[12:36:12] <NoiseEee> codephobic: in addition to making things cross-browser, one of the nice things about jquery is that you can do more by writing less, so to speak
[12:36:29] <codephobic> NoiseEee, will do. I've got to now convert the functions for adding up items and removing items from the order list, to jQuery... I suppose it's the same procedure, splicing by the index to get the item out of the order list array...
[12:37:19] <defaultro_> Update, http://jsfiddle.net/M422n/15/
[12:37:29] <NoiseEee> codephobic: probably, but its worth loading up the API reference website at the same time to see about any traversing/array methods that jquery can speed your stuff up with as well
[12:37:37] <codephobic> NoiseEee, I'm wary of that because, as a newbie, I could just end up lost further in the jungle than I would have been if I made the initial effort to grasp what I was playing with... I guess I'm just scared of getting too deep into something without a good enough understanding of it
[12:38:03] <codephobic> NoiseEee, good idea... coffee and jQuery api next.
[12:38:13] <NoiseEee> codephobic: totally respectable... but do it separately.  a nice example would be to build something with all natural JS and understanding how/why... then doing a jquery implementation of it
[12:38:37] <Pilate> then eventually you end up doing the opposite :P
[12:38:46] <codephobic> hehe
[12:39:16] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: thats broken. you will probably need to store the original values. try using 36 miles
[12:39:28] <eddiemonge> sorry, 36 kms
[12:39:28] <defaultro_> k
[12:39:39] <eddiemonge> and then toggle a few times. you will end up with a different number
[12:39:54] <codephobic> NoiseEee, will have to look into some project for that ... maybe a music player or something.
[12:40:08] <defaultro_> ah, you mean, the rounding off?
[12:40:24] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: yeah
[12:40:43] <nym> SlexAxton: hey sexy
[12:40:58] <defaultro_> if we want precise, I will have to add the decimal number but it's ok for our requirement since values are for road speed
[12:41:09] <defaultro_> it will not change a lot
[12:41:19] <defaultro_> we won't be putting unusual number
[12:41:23] <eddiemonge> so its fine to go from 36 to 22 and then to 35?
[12:42:34] <nym> SlexAxton: I'm debugging an issue with YepNope that you might have insight on
[12:43:17] <nym> SlexAxton: when i simulate slow speeds (basically anything under 3G) yep nope prematurely  executes the complete handler
[12:43:30] <bluesm> Hi.
[12:43:34] <nym> hello
[12:43:39] <BillCriswell> nym: I can relate to that.
[12:43:51] <bluesm> I make a little thing.
[12:43:52] <bluesm> http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/1/
[12:44:04] <bluesm> Coping the code from http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[12:44:10] <bluesm> First way.
[12:44:31] <bluesm> But why he do the "$(this).next().length" ?
[12:44:45] <eddiemonge> to make sure there is a next element
[12:44:53] <BillCriswell> bluesm: To stop it from going into infinite and beyond.
[12:44:55] <defaultro_> eddiemonge: got your point :)
[12:44:57] <bluesm> If simply $(this).next() ~ return false if there is no element
[12:45:08] <bluesm> Look.
[12:45:13] <defaultro_> but we won't have 36 miles on entry
[12:45:21] <eddiemonge> bluesm: it returns an empty array, not false
[12:45:26] <Eviltwin> I would just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/2/
[12:45:26] <defaultro_> we'll only have 25, 35, 50, 60, 65
[12:45:43] <bluesm>  eddiemonge: [] == false
[12:45:51] <eddiemonge> [] !== false
[12:45:55] <bluesm> In console too ...
[12:46:00] <bluesm> soo.
[12:46:10] <bluesm> ?
[12:46:10] <defaultro_> eddiemonge: what would be a good solution though?
[12:46:43] <rmurphey> bluesm: your console says [] == false ?
[12:46:43] <eddiemonge> defaultro_: like i said, you could store the original value in .data() and then operate on that, changing the val to match
[12:46:46] <Eviltwin> bluesm: See http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/2/
[12:47:12] <defaultro_> eddiemonge: cool. I will have to do some research first, I don't know how to use .data
[12:47:52] <bluesm> Eviltwin: How do you stop it ?
[12:48:37] <Eviltwin> bluesm: Try doing this: $().fadeIn("fast", function(){ console.log("callback ran") });
[12:51:46] <BillCriswell> bluesm: If the code is tough to understand you can think of it like this... at least I do anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/3/
[12:51:47] <bluesm> Eviltwin: Wow.
[12:52:06] <bluesm> Eviltwin: So jquery have hight level of checking for errors... Wow.
[12:53:44] <bluesm> BillCriswell:  http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/4/   ~ also works without "length"
[12:53:49] <bluesm> :)
[12:54:21] <Eviltwin> bluesm: You also see that "Done" never gets logged
[12:54:28] <BillCriswell> bluesm: There's no "Done" there.
[12:54:29] <Eviltwin> It's working for the same reason mine works
[12:54:53] <Eviltwin> And that's because the callback fires for each element animated
[12:55:06] <bluesm> oh why ?
[12:55:10] <Eviltwin> And in the last case there will be no elements
[12:55:14] <Eviltwin> So it won't fire
[12:56:19] <bluesm>  BillCriswell:  Why there is no done ?
[12:56:39] <bluesm> becaues of
[12:56:52] <bluesm> $()  won't fire also ?
[12:56:53] <bluesm> Yes?
[12:58:33] <Eviltwin> ?eval $() ? true : false
[12:58:41] <bluesm> There is any reason to use this "if" or "&&" if $() won't fire anyway ? ?
[12:58:42] <Eviltwin> Hmm...
[12:58:45] <Eviltwin> No bot-t
[12:59:09] <Eviltwin> Dude, just use this: http://jsfiddle.net/STs46/2/
[12:59:26] <bluesm> Eviltwin: Mhm :)
[13:00:08] <bluesm> how jquery devise that "he" shouldn't fire anything from $() ~ empty element ?
[13:00:21] <Eviltwin> "he"?
[13:00:58] <BillCriswell> I always imagine jQuery as a sexy young lady who takes care of old men.
[13:01:09] <Eviltwin> As I said, it fires the callback for each element whose animation completed
[13:01:13] <Eviltwin> See this for example: http://jsfiddle.net/fZ9pB/
[13:01:27] <Eviltwin> Part way through the animation two of those get stopped
[13:01:46] <Eviltwin> So their callbacks don't fire because they didn't reach the end of the animation
[13:01:51] <Eviltwin> But it does fire for the remaining elements
[13:02:29] <Eviltwin> Look under the "Complete Function" heading here http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:03:30] <jeffsmykil> Anyone had problems getting -ms-transform to work when using $("element").css()
[13:03:36] <bluesm> You are awesome :)
[13:03:43] <bluesm> Eviltwin: Thank you very much :)
[13:04:44] <black_warlock> Eviltwin
[13:04:49] <black_warlock> there?
[13:05:10] <black_warlock> who can help me with a parsing ?
[13:05:21] <black_warlock> json parsing
[13:05:30] <jeffsmykil> i fucking hate IE
[13:05:36] <jeffsmykil> fucking piece of shit
[13:05:37] <black_warlock> all hate it :P
[13:05:55] <Usse> welcome to the club..
[13:06:16] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: JSON.parse
[13:06:44] <black_warlock> i know that but i have almost done i lack some info
[13:12:43] <jeffsmykil> for those not aware you can't use - in the dom apparently
[13:12:48] <jeffsmykil> -ms-transform
[13:12:52] <jeffsmykil> has to be msTransform
[13:13:02] <Eviltwin> Uh, what?
[13:13:34] <jeffsmykil> err dashes in style names
[13:13:35] <jeffsmykil> sorry
[13:13:45] <jeffsmykil> dashes in stylenames are not allowed in dom scripting
[13:13:52] <Eviltwin> Oh, in JavaScript
[13:14:01] <Eviltwin> .style.msTransform
[13:14:20] <jeffsmykil> can you set a filter vias .css() Eviltwin?
[13:14:39] <Eviltwin> I believe so
[13:15:44] <bluesm> It is not that if I make jQuery object.
[13:15:52] <bluesm> This make (write to the memory) all the methods
[13:16:16] <bluesm> Actually it inherit the methods from some (one) storage.
[13:16:21] <bluesm> Yep ?
[13:16:34] <mouses> how do i use animate() with   left: +=variable instead of   left: '+=500'
[13:18:30] <Servercrash> how to apply modifiec css values using jquery to newly added dom element (by ajax)
[13:18:40] <Servercrash> automatically
[13:18:58] <Servercrash> as of now the newly added element takes the default css and not modified css values
[13:19:24] <shinta42> anyone use zen coding?
[13:20:37] <NoiseEee> yep
[13:21:19] <shinta42> noiseeee:how does the shortcut for css properties work? like what will i have to do in sublime text2 to convert m:a into margin:auto
[13:22:24] <NoiseEee> i don't think you get to do css stuff with zen coding
[13:22:52] <NoiseEee> shinta42: http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/wiki/ZenHTMLSelectorsEn
[13:23:03] <shinta42> noiseeee:i am looking at the cheat sheet
[13:23:12] <shinta42> noiseee:it has an entire page on css properties
[13:23:33] <shinta42> noiseeee:http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/downloads/detail?name=ZenCodingCheatSheet.pdf
[13:25:16] <manners13> hey guys
[13:25:25] <NoiseEee> shinta42: your question is about sublime text2 then
[13:25:34] <NoiseEee> shinta42: read what you have to do to enable zen coding
[13:25:45] <manners13> i am currently building a restore webpage for my backup service
[13:26:32] <shinta42> noiseeee:thats not complete i dont think
[13:26:44] <shinta42> noiseeee:according to the official cheatsheet there r also css properties shortcuts
[13:27:07] <NoiseEee> shinta42: in my IDE, m:a turns into margin:auto.  your question has nothing to do with #jquery.  try #yourIDE or something
[13:27:28] <manners13> i have got it to the point where i use dyantree to display a tree with checkboxes, however when i select a folder i only manage to ee the folder name selected using this code http://codepad.org/8tkVgJ48 , i could really do with getting a list of the filenames selected including full path if possible however filenames alone would suffice,
[13:27:49] <shinta42> noiseeee:what ide do u use
[13:27:51] <manners13> i have no clue about javascript or jquery and have so far got by using examples
[13:28:10] <manners13> could anyone point me in the right direction please
[13:28:38] <NoiseEee> jetbrains stuff.
[13:35:38] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: thoughts on this?  $("#map").css( "filter", "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotaion=1)");
[13:36:46] <Eviltwin> Looks like excruciatingly awful IE synta
[13:36:48] <moijk> using ie only css is a bit 90s. in this century other browsers have half the market.
[13:37:10] <jeffsmykil> I know this mojik, if I didnt have to do it I wouldn't
[13:37:16] <eddiemonge> still leaves IE with half the market though
[13:37:27] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: excruitiatingly not working
[13:37:34] <Eviltwin> I think you need "-ms-filter" or "msFilter" not just "filter"
[13:37:36] <jeffsmykil> in our market its about 99%
[13:38:00] <moijk> well if that suits your business by all means.
[13:38:14] <Eviltwin> What is your market?
[13:38:24] <jeffsmykil> dont think the dashes will work because of the style in dom thing
[13:38:28] <jeffsmykil> health care
[13:38:34] <mouses> animate( params, [duration], [easing], [callback] )  <== what if i want to leave out the easing, whats the syntax?
[13:38:36] <moijk> but i would never leave any of my clients with less support than 95% of the target audience.
[13:39:07] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: jQuery performs a transformation on the dash syntax to make it match the JavaScript style syntax
[13:39:23] <Eviltwin> mouses: .animate(parrams, duration, callback)
[13:39:23] <mouses> Eviltwin: what if i want to leave out the easing?
[13:39:24] <jeffsmykil> well thats handu
[13:39:31] <jeffsmykil> unfortunately it still doesnt work
[13:39:33] <mouses> ok, so js knows huh?
[13:39:42] <Eviltwin> jQuery knows, yes
[13:39:59] <mouses> thx
[13:40:24] <jeffsmykil> imagines a jquery knows ad campaing
[13:43:20] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: any other ideas?
[13:44:32] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Did you try .css("-ms-filter", ...) ?
[13:44:46] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[13:45:10] <Eviltwin> You do know what you sent contains "rotaion" not "rotation" right?
[13:45:26] <jeffsmykil> i have also tried banging my head on desk  several times
[13:45:30] <jeffsmykil> oh FFS
[13:46:01] <jeffsmykil> $("#map").css( "-ms-filter", "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1)");
[13:46:21] <Eviltwin> So that's what you have in your actual source?
[13:46:27] <jeffsmykil> now i do
[13:46:32] <jeffsmykil> and it still doesn't work
[13:46:42] <jeffsmykil> this is why we cant have nice things
[13:47:11] <accesscode> i have an select option , how can i make the selected to the first option in jquery?
[13:47:59] <Eviltwin> Well that correctly sets the map.style.msFilter to that string for me
[13:48:08] <Eviltwin> I never work with ms transforms though
[13:48:18] <jeffsmykil> did it actually do it for you?
[13:48:20] <accesscode> i tried $("#target")[0].selectedIndex=0; <-- is this correct do i need [0] ?
[13:48:34] <Eviltwin> It actually set it but I don't ever ever use IE
[13:48:41] <Eviltwin> So it had no effect, obviously
[13:49:04] <Eviltwin> Which version of IE?
[13:49:05] * jeffsmykil connects to the ancient windows server
[13:49:15] <Eviltwin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617220/css-rotate-property-in-ie
[13:49:24] <Eviltwin> It looks like it's actually a string in the second form
[13:49:41] <Eviltwin> Which means it'd be .css("-ms-filter", '"progid:..."')
[13:49:52] <Eviltwin> Notice the two layers of quotes on the value
[13:50:02] <jeffsmykil> $("#map").css( "-ms-filter", "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1)");
[13:50:08] <jeffsmykil> oh i missed those
[13:50:29] <jeffsmykil> do i need to escape those?
[13:50:57] <Eviltwin> Either "\"progid:...\"" or '"progid:..."'
[13:51:09] <accesscode> $(".form-item-attributes-46,.form-item-attributes-60,.form-item-attributes-56,.form-item-attributes-31,.form-item-attributes-9,.form-item-attributes-52,.form-item-attributes-49,.form-item-attributes-20,.form-item-attributes-14,.form-item-attributes-28,.form-item-attributes-43,.form-item-attributes-34,.form-item-attributes-37,.form-item-attributes-40,.form-item-attributes-24")[0].selectedIndex=0
[13:51:09] <accesscode> ;  <-- any clue how can i achieve this...
[13:51:13] <jeffsmykil> yup tried both
[13:51:19] <jeffsmykil> $("#map").css( "-ms-filter", "'progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1)'");
[13:51:27] <Eviltwin> Other way around
[13:51:33] <Eviltwin> I think it needs to be double quotes on the inside
[13:52:12] <jeffsmykil> fucking bizarre
[13:52:15] <jeffsmykil> still nothing
[13:52:42] <Eviltwin> Did you try just "filter" with the rotation instead of rotaion?
[13:52:55] <Eviltwin> (without this double quoting business)
[13:53:00] <jeffsmykil> oh shit
[13:53:09] <jeffsmykil> do i need radians for ie 7
[13:53:30] <Eviltwin> I have no clue
[13:53:33] <Eviltwin> Maybe this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617220/css-rotate-property-in-ie
[13:53:36] <Eviltwin> I gotta go
[13:54:07] <jeffsmykil> thanks Eviltwin
[13:57:57] <accesscode> any help please
[14:00:04] <BillCriswell> accesscode: What are these .form-item-attributes-* ?
[14:01:42] <accesscode> thos are select
[14:01:48] <accesscode> ahhhhh
[14:01:50] <accesscode> grrr
[14:01:55] <accesscode> right
[14:02:48] <BillCriswell> accesscode: Select elements?

[14:04:35] <accesscode> i tried this.. but only this item changed = .form-item-attributes-46 select
[14:05:19] <BillCriswell> accesscode: Ok.
[14:05:38] <BillCriswell> accesscode: So a .form-item is a div or something?
[14:06:22] <accesscode> yes a wrapper
[14:06:27] <accesscode> sounds ok now
[14:06:43] <accesscode> .val("option:first");
[14:06:46] <BillCriswell> You can do: $('div[class^=form-item-attributes] select')[0] could work.
[14:06:52] <BillCriswell> You want the first option of each select?
[14:08:08] <accesscode> but i have three categories of form-item-attributes not all
[14:08:47] <BillCriswell> accesscode: I think I'd need to see your code and an example of what you want back cause you're really confusing.
[14:10:24] <shoky> accesscode:  $(whatever).prop('selectedIndex', 0)
[14:10:27] <accesscode> i mean... i have div.form-item-attributes-{1,2,3,4} div.form-item-attributes-{5,6,7,8} and div.form-item-attributes-{9,10,11,12} for example.. others i have to retain, the some i have to reset
[14:10:46] <NoiseEee> accesscode: you're misusing/abusing classes
[14:11:06] <NoiseEee> accesscode: use data- attributes to store data on elements
[14:11:19] <accesscode> how?
[14:11:27] <BillCriswell> accesscode: The code I provided would select all of selects inside all of those divs.
[14:11:41] <BillCriswell> I like that quit message haha.
[14:12:17] <accesscode> .val("option:first"); <-- seems to work fine, does this have a draw back?
[14:12:34] <shoky> i doubt that does what you think it does
[14:12:46] <shoky> accesscode have you tried .prop('selectedIndex', 0)
[14:12:53] <BillCriswell> You should also try to alter the HTML to be like class="form-item-attributes form-item-attributes-23" or  use data-* like NoiseEee said.
[14:12:55] <shoky> without [0]
[14:13:08] <NoiseEee> .form-item-attributes-{1,2,3,4} is not an acceptable class name
[14:13:16] <accesscode> errrr...
[14:13:21] <accesscode> i mean thats an array.
[14:13:30] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I think he means it as .form-item-attributes-1,  .form-item-attributes-2,  .form-item-attributes-3...
[14:13:36] <accesscode> .form-item-attributes-1, .form-item-attributes-2 ....
[14:13:47] <NoiseEee> right, same answer from me though accesscode
[14:14:05] <accesscode> i wish i can group them but the cms auto generate this classes
[14:14:16] <NoiseEee> ah ok, good luck
[14:14:54] <accesscode> anyway... shoky... thats the difference between .val("option:first"); and .prop('selectedIndex',0); ?
[14:15:07] <black_warlock> who can halp meeeeeeee
[14:15:11] <black_warlock> T_T
[14:15:12] <shoky> .val('option:first') sets the value property to the string 'option:first', afaik
[14:15:16] <BillCriswell> accesscode: : $('div[class^=form-item-attributes]') can select all those divs... or if it's the direct child of a common parent you can do $('.parent > div')
[14:16:40] <accesscode> ok im using .prop now
[14:17:23] <accesscode> select ???  7Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'prop'
[14:17:35] <shoky> what jquery version
[14:18:12] <accesscode> 1.5.2
[14:18:19] <shoky> ya prop is from 1.6
[14:18:26] <shoky> maybe try .attr, i donno
[14:20:16] <accesscode> oh my
[14:22:35] <vacho> guys.
[14:23:40] <vacho> I have this... <td data-asset-type='444'></td>  ... how do I call it with jquery?   $('td').attr('data-asset-type').val('444'); ????
[14:23:40] <tw2113> yo
[14:24:06] <tw2113> wouldn't it be $('td').data('asset-type'); ?
[14:24:08] <BillCriswell> vacho: No. $('td[data-asset-type=444]')
[14:24:21] <tw2113> *fires up jsbin*
[14:24:47] <vacho> BillCriswell: thanks..it get's trickier though!
[14:25:41] <BillCriswell> I'm not surprised.
[14:25:56] <tw2113> $('td').attr('data-asset-type'); worked for me with console.log
[14:26:00] <tw2113> showed 444
[14:26:16] <tw2113> same with $('td').data('asset-type');
[14:26:18] <BillCriswell> tw2113: You're reading the value of that attribute.
[14:26:31] <tw2113> is that not what we want?
[14:26:34] <vacho> BillCriswell:  is this legal ? :) $('tr[data-asset-type=9113] td[data-type=image_batch_1] span.value').html('text');
[14:26:35] <BillCriswell> Not trying to get an element based on the value of the attribute.
[14:26:52] <tw2113> trying to set it?
[14:26:56] <BillCriswell> vacho: Looks good to me.
[14:27:21] <BillCriswell> tw2113: He's trying to get the element, not just read the data-asset-type on it.
[14:27:27] <tw2113> ah
[14:27:31] <tw2113> grab the whole td
[14:27:41] <BillCriswell> Yesh.
[14:27:46] <vacho> $('tr[data-asset-type=9113] td[data-type=image_batch_1] span').html('text');
[14:27:48] <vacho> didn't work/
[14:28:09] <vacho> im trying to put a text in a span that's inside a td that's inside a tr :)
[14:28:09] <BillCriswell> vacho: You're doing something else wrong then.
[14:28:16] <NoiseEee> quotes around the value
[14:28:28] <NoiseEee> $('tr[data-asset-type="9113"]')
[14:28:36] <black_warlock> guys pls who has 5 mins ?
[14:28:42] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Since when do you have to do that? =(
[14:28:50] <NoiseEee> afaik always, i thought
[14:29:11] <BillCriswell> Don't think that's the issue here. You would need to do that if there was a space in the value or something.
[14:30:07] <vacho> does not work
[14:30:28] <black_warlock> Eviltwin
[14:30:29] <BillCriswell> vacho: That's the most useless thing you can say.
[14:30:44] <shoky> black_warlock: if you don't ask a real question nobody will help you
[14:31:00] <vacho> it works :D!
[14:31:05] <black_warlock> i need to list all the items in json string
[14:31:07] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/yygp7/19/
[14:31:43] <BillCriswell> vacho: Sweet.
[14:32:53] <vacho> I know how to capture the value of an inputfield based on id... but what if I want to capture by name="xxx" ?
[14:33:13] <BillCriswell> vacho: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[14:34:05] <BillCriswell> The same exact thing you just did with the <td>.
[14:34:06] <vacho> i did look there, didn't quite understand it.
[14:34:14] <vacho> let me try again.
[14:34:28] <silverwind> vacho: Can't you do it without that?
[14:35:16] <Usse> vacho: $("input[name='yourInputName']")
[14:36:19] <silverwind> Then one day.. the backend guy might change the name... because he needs it for the server-side controller and that will mess up the javascript.
[14:36:42] <vacho> $('tr[data-asset-status-id="'+asset_status_id+'"] td[data-type="'+type+'"] span.val').html($('input name="value"').val());
[14:36:55] <BillCriswell> black_warlock: You're calling processYouTube befores it's defined. Also, you're using notice before it's set. Make sure you check the console for errors.
[14:37:12] <black_warlock> i did now
[14:37:20] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/yygp7/25/
[14:37:30] <black_warlock> who can help me with listing
[14:37:39] <BillCriswell> black_warlock: entries is not defined.
[14:37:40] <black_warlock> i just need to list every item in json string
[14:37:45] <black_warlock> ofc
[14:37:52] <black_warlock> that part its copied from google
[14:38:10] <BillCriswell> vacho: dude.
[14:38:20] <black_warlock> starting from : for (var i = 0; i < entries.length; ++i)
[14:39:38] <vacho> BillCriswell: yes
[14:40:09] <BillCriswell> You have code in your code that explains how to use the code that's not working.
[14:40:17] <BillCriswell> how to fix*
[14:40:21] <vacho> no
[14:40:35] <vacho> I have 5 radio buttons that all share the same "name" field..
[14:40:52] <vacho> I get it to capture but it does not capture the selected or active radio button.
[14:41:11] <shoky> you were told "input[name='yourInputName']"
[14:41:12] <tw2113> black_warlock, wouldn't the data variable you pass in be what you use in the for loop?
[14:41:32] <vacho> shoky: yes, that work! but it gets the value of the first radio button instead of the selected one.
[14:41:54] <shoky> vacho: then find out how to get the selected one..
[14:42:07] <tw2113> :selected
[14:42:07] <black_warlock> ye
[14:42:45] <BillCriswell> vacho: You pasted: $('input name="value"')
[14:42:57] <vacho> $('tr[data-asset-status-id="'+asset_status_id+'"] td[data-type="'+type+'"] span.val').html($('input[name="value"]:checked').val());
[14:42:58] <black_warlock> im reading google exples but its not clear
[14:43:02] <vacho> thanks yall!
[14:43:10] <vacho> had to add :checked!
[14:43:23] <tw2113> black_warlock, success: function(data)
[14:43:23] <black_warlock> dam instead to make samples on single video
[14:43:33] <tw2113> data is going to hold the results of the json fetch
[14:43:36] <black_warlock> they make samples on events list
[14:43:38] <black_warlock> https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/json?hl=it
[14:43:55] <black_warlock> i have to list every item in json
[14:44:06] <black_warlock> and extract what i need if i need it
[14:44:19] <black_warlock> like title or description or a photo
[14:45:09] <BillCriswell> black_warlock: Do console.log( data ) and look at what you're working with.
[14:45:09] <tw2113> i'm still not seeing where entries gets any value though
[14:45:21] <tw2113> which had me asking why you were looping on that
[14:45:23] <tw2113> instead of data
[14:45:29] <black_warlock> i have a sample here
[14:45:41] <black_warlock> of youtube video
[14:45:42] <black_warlock> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=json
[14:46:15] <tw2113> and it's lovely json
[14:46:31] <black_warlock> yep
[14:46:35] <tw2113> for (var i = 0; i < entries.length; ++i)  <---what does entries have in it?
[14:46:37] <black_warlock> i must read that infos
[14:46:42] <black_warlock> one sec
[14:47:36] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/yygp7/27/
[14:47:41] <black_warlock> i added entries
[14:48:17] <BillCriswell> Now root is undefined.
[14:48:38] <black_warlock> yes one sec
[14:48:45] <black_warlock> its not root but url.feed
[14:49:21] <black_warlock> aff
[14:49:24] <black_warlock> T_T
[14:49:32] <fris> use .getjson
[14:49:55] <BillCriswell> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/yygp7/29/ and take a look at the console.
[14:50:45] <black_warlock> i was using just this sample
[14:50:46] <black_warlock> https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/json?hl=it
[14:50:48] <BillCriswell> There is no data.feed.entry
[14:51:06] <black_warlock> it is wrong
[14:51:10] <tw2113> for some reason, i can not get data to console.log
[14:51:48] <tw2113> *kicks firebug*
[14:51:55] <shoky> data.feed IS an entry
[14:54:10] <BillCriswell> I'm out, have a good night!
[14:54:11] <tw2113> data.feed.title and then need to get through the $t part
[14:54:30] <fris> http://jsfiddle.net/dFFMM/
[14:54:35] <tw2113> i always forget how to handle $'s in json
[14:55:36] <tw2113> data.feed is the entry point to your whole result
[14:57:22] <Shai_Tan> If I have $_COOKIE['foo']['bar'] = "blah" in my php, how do I change the value from "blah" to "pussy cat" in jquery
[14:58:11] <black_warlock> fris that a google sample i know that one
[14:58:24] <tw2113> you'd have to echo the php part into a js variable and then go from there Shai_Tan
[14:58:31] <tw2113> fris knows about js, he's from the 90s
[14:59:08] <black_warlock> i need to extract title image and description
[14:59:43] <Shai_Tan> tw2113: ?? I mean like jQuery.cookie("gold[postcode]", jQuery("#postcode").val(), { expires: 365, path:"/"});
[14:59:47] <Shai_Tan> that does not work
[15:00:30] <fris> black_warlock you can use a callback as well http://jsfiddle.net/JkvqK/
[15:00:45] <tw2113> <script> var mycookie = <?php echo $_COOKIE['foo']['bar']; ?>; </script>
[15:01:10] <tw2113> then you can keep doing whatever with mycookie
[15:01:39] <Shai_Tan> the cookie is set
[15:01:47] <Shai_Tan> now, in jquery I wish to set it to another value
[15:02:16] <Shai_Tan> I do not care what the current value is
[15:02:58] <tw2113> then you're probably going to need ajax of some sort
[15:03:02] <rmurphey> tw2113: no
[15:03:06] <rmurphey> i mean
[15:03:13] <rmurphey> you can use the jquery cookie plugin to set a cookie
[15:03:17] <Shai_Tan> ajax? to set a cookie?
[15:03:24] <tw2113> didn't know there was a jquery cookie plugin
[15:03:25] <rmurphey> the question is, what exactly is php setting? cookies are strings
[15:03:25] <tw2113> my bad
[15:03:28] <Shai_Tan> rmurphey: I have the cookie plugin
[15:03:41] <Shai_Tan> rmurphey: the cookie is just a number
[15:03:42] <rmurphey> so you're setting the 'bar' property of the 'foo' cookie
[15:03:52] <tw2113> i was sitting here thinking php and js and how php is parsed and already executed by the time you start using js
[15:04:00] <Shai_Tan> rmurphey: yes
[15:04:06] <rmurphey> and it sorta depends on how that manifests itself
[15:04:27] <Shai_Tan> so I have an array in the $_COOKIE
[15:04:34] <rmurphey> when you use the cookie plugin to get the value of the cookie you're trying to change
[15:04:36] <Shai_Tan> wth name, postcode age etc
[15:04:37] <rmurphey> what is the value?
[15:04:53] <Shai_Tan> I cannot retrieve it either
[15:05:02] <rmurphey> i mean, the 'foo' cookie
[15:05:10] <rmurphey> don't try to retrieve foo[bar] yet
[15:05:13] <rmurphey> just retrieve foo
[15:05:16] <rmurphey> and see what it is
[15:05:23] <Shai_Tan> ok, sec
[15:05:25] <rmurphey> because it is probably something like
[15:05:31] <rmurphey> bar=1&baz=2&...
[15:05:33] <rmurphey> or something
[15:06:22] <rmurphey> because cookies are strongs
[15:06:24] <rmurphey> strings
[15:06:26] <rmurphey> not arrays, not objects
[15:06:27] <rmurphey> strings
[15:06:38] <Shai_Tan> gotcha
[15:06:39] <rmurphey> php may do some stuff to let you treat them as objects
[15:06:49] <black_warlock> fris that almost what i need
[15:07:09] <black_warlock> but i need to get info or a singular video only
[15:07:15] <black_warlock> of*
[15:08:06] <Shai_Tan> alert( jQuery.cookie("gold") )
[15:08:08] <Shai_Tan> null
[15:08:26] <rmurphey> does chrome dev tools show that the cookie is set?
[15:08:53] <rmurphey> (under the resources tab)
[15:09:13] <rmurphey> you should be able to look there and see which cookies are set for the domain
[15:09:22] <rmurphey> and hopefully that will get you pointed in the right direction
[15:09:28] <rmurphey> also, don't use alert, use console.log
[15:18:23] <black_warlock> gawd
[15:18:27] <black_warlock> doesnt work
[15:22:26] <black_warlock> fris there?

[15:24:52] <black_warlock> ye
[15:25:31] <black_warlock> how do you read a content like : "media$title":{"$t":"ultrasta - smalltalk (Four Tet remix)"
[15:25:49] <tw2113> dunno up to the point of the $'s
[15:26:10] <black_warlock> "media$title":{"$t":"ultrasta - smalltalk (Four Tet remix)","type":"plain"}
[15:26:12] <rmurphey> tw2113: there's nthing special about the $
[15:26:15] <shoky> obj.media$title.$t
[15:26:18] <tw2113> regardless, you still have data[0] is undefined errors
[15:26:25] <rmurphey> media$title.$t
[15:26:36] <tw2113> *learns new things*
[15:27:03] <black_warlock> but i did it
[15:27:08] <black_warlock> shoky
[15:27:11] <jenia> hello everyone
[15:27:17] <black_warlock> it doesnt work
[15:27:22] <jenia> i'm passing afunction to jquery $.get method
[15:27:27] <shoky> regardless, that's how you do it.
[15:27:28] <black_warlock> on vime works but on youube doesnt
[15:27:48] <jenia> in that function i need to use some variable that i've defined outside. like so:
[15:27:51] <rmurphey> black_warlock: there is far too much code in that fiddle for us to go through
[15:27:53] <jenia> var x='blabla'
[15:28:06] <rmurphey> if you can make a simplified case that shows the data and how you are trying to access it, maybe we can see your error
[15:28:07] <black_warlock> you dont have to read all
[15:28:21] <tw2113> you do if you want to make sense of it
[15:28:24] <black_warlock> just the function processYouTube(id, title) {
[15:28:24] <tw2113> as an outsider
[15:28:30] <rgenito> ;(
[15:28:35] <jenia> $.get('/my_url',{'x':'hello world'}, function(){x.do_something})
[15:28:48] <jenia> how can i achieve this?
[15:28:54] <shoky> what is x
[15:29:04] <rmurphey> jenia: store the object in a variable first
[15:29:06] <jenia> its an object i defined i my system
[15:29:19] <jenia> you mena inside the nameless function?
[15:29:19] <rmurphey> then $.get('/my_url', obj, function() { obj.x.whatever })
[15:29:22] <jenia> or were?
[15:29:32] <rmurphey> no, define the var before you do $.get
[15:29:37] <jenia> okay
[15:30:12] <rmurphey> http://jsfiddle.net/MxzgX/
[15:30:26] <jenia> oh, okay to add x as a variable belonging to obj
[15:30:33] <rmurphey> x is not a variable
[15:30:36] <rmurphey> x is a property of an object
[15:30:46] <jenia> oh no no
[15:31:01] <rmurphey> oh yess yes
[15:31:07] <jenia> oh yea
[15:31:07] <rmurphey> in the example you gave above, x is a property
[15:31:08] <jenia> okay
[15:31:08] <jenia> haha
[15:31:10] <shoky> ungh
[15:31:27] <jenia> yea you;re right so if i have y=new SomeObject
[15:31:46] <jenia> i can do do obj.y and access it from the nameless function
[15:31:47] <jenia> okay thanks
[15:31:51] <rmurphey> sigh, no
[15:32:16] <rgenito> *sigh*, in firebug (or chrome's inspector) i'm having the hardest time finding this background image for a td
[15:32:17] <rmurphey> if you are doing y = new SomeObject()
[15:32:22] <rmurphey> then y is a variable
[15:32:26] <jenia> yes
[15:32:27] <rgenito> well, i can find it... but i cannot find out why the background image isn't showing. any ideas?
[15:32:41] <rmurphey> if you're doing it without a var statement, then y is a global variable, which is probably a bad idea
[15:32:43] <rgenito> it happens on: http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/rental/CARCAS4/
[15:33:06] <tw2113> where should it be rgenito ?
[15:33:11] <jenia> nono. y is just a local varialbe
[15:33:19] <rmurphey> jenia: if you can put together a fiddle that demonstrates more clearly what you're trying to do
[15:33:21] <jenia> its a reference to an object i  created
[15:33:22] <rmurphey> then we can be more helpful
[15:33:26] <rmurphey> what you've asked so far is not clear
[15:33:28] <rgenito> tw2113, on that date picker, click oct 11, then click nov 2
[15:33:33] <jenia> okay. one minute
[15:33:45] <aaas> newbie ?: (see: http://jsfiddle.net/RnCmN/) in the syntax var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(...),function(chart)({...}) is there a name for the ',function()' that I can google for to learn what is going on? ('function chaining?')
[15:33:52] <rgenito> tw2113, the background image should be on the nov 2 td
[15:34:09] <rgenito> i've gotta be missing something small and dumb.. but i just cannot figure it out :(
[15:34:32] <scar> im using .change() to detect a change in a dropdown, and i want a div to appear-- preferably not "revealed", but somehow created dynamically.any ideas?
[15:35:06] <shoky> rgenito: you have more specific css selectors that are overriding your background-image  (with background-color)
[15:35:08] <rmurphey> aaas: the function is simply a second argument being passed to Highcharts.Chart, no?
[15:35:17] <shoky> sorry, background, not background-color
[15:35:26] <rgenito> shoky, aww man... so because they're setting a background color... this is messing things up?
[15:35:27] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/MxzgX/1/
[15:35:30] <jenia> this is what i mean
[15:35:39] <shoky> rgenito: first of all don't use !important unless you know what you're doing
[15:35:40] <rmurphey> aaas: i'm pretty sure it is just a function that is called after the chart is initialized
[15:35:53] <rgenito> shoky, this isn't my css =\ i'm fixing it
[15:36:11] <shoky> rgenito: 2nd of all, make your css selector for the background-image more specific than the other one setting 'background'
[15:36:11] <rmurphey> jenia: what is your question?
[15:36:17] <rgenito> (but i'll admit i have no idea what !important does)
[15:36:28] <rmurphey> jenia: also do not use new Object(), simply use {}
[15:36:31] <aaas> rmurphey ah, is this a general construct...if I want to call another function immediately after I can just use ',function()'
[15:36:37] <jenia> i want to use a reference to an object from inside a $.get('url',{},function(){object.toString()})
[15:36:38] <tw2113> rgenito, i think line 320 is too specific of a selector
[15:37:06] <tw2113> yeah, what shoky said while i was poking
[15:37:08] <rmurphey> aaas: the highcharts api -- i'm not familiar with it, but it seems that when you initialize a chart, you can specify a callback function
[15:37:21] <rgenito> interesting
[15:37:26] <rmurphey> which receives the just-created chart as its argument
[15:37:32] <jenia> rmill, shoky is that possible?
[15:37:35] <aaas> rmurphey ah ok so this would have been defined in the api
[15:37:41] <rgenito> shoky what do you mean by "make your css selector for the background-image more specific"?
[15:37:45] <jenia> rmurphey, is that possible
[15:37:52] <shoky> jenia: yes very possible as rmurphey showed you
[15:37:58] <aaas> rmurphey thanks
[15:38:01] <rgenito> i did have: td.datepickerSelected.datepickerDepartureBookedArrival
[15:38:04] <rmurphey> jenia: sure
[15:38:09] <rgenito> ...but that didn't work either, so i tried making it less specific :)
[15:38:14] <rmurphey> is there anything that's not working about the code in the fiddle?
[15:38:38] <jenia> wont the get method send the attributes of my object over the network?
[15:38:39] <JFranks> Trying to make this http://jsfiddle.net/CQuRM/ work like this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/#demo  ?
[15:38:42] <Klowner> Anyone know if there's a way to immediately trigger an event?
[15:38:47] <rmurphey> um, no
[15:38:56] <shoky> rgenito: your css for background-image is just on:   .datepickerDepartureBookedArrival {
[15:38:59] <shoky> that's not specific at all
[15:39:10] <rmurphey> jenia: $.get will send the data specified in the second argument
[15:39:14] <jenia> the syntax is $.get('url', 'get:paramters',function(){})
[15:39:16] <rmurphey> it won't send anything from my_obj
[15:39:23] <JFranks> I AM SO DUMB... Sorry. ;)
[15:39:31] <shoky> but because you have !important somewhere, you'll need to make this one REALLY speficic or have !important also... or get rid of the original !important and do things right ;p
[15:39:40] <rmurphey> jenia: you can also choose to send no data at all
[15:39:46] <rmurphey> but i'm really not clear where you're stuck
[15:40:02] <jenia> okay. let me explain again
[15:40:03] <rgenito> shoky alrighty, i just changed it back to td.datepickerSelected.datepickerDepartureBookedArrival
[15:40:03] <rmurphey> your example has two objects, data and my_obj
[15:40:08] <jenia> var data = { x : 'foo' };
[15:40:08] <jenia> $.get('/my_url', data, function() { console.log(data.x); });​
[15:40:11] <rgenito> i'm trying now what tw2113 suggested (line 320)
[15:40:20] <rmurphey> jenia: do you *want* to send the data over the network?
[15:40:21] <jenia> this is what i needs except is the anynymous function
[15:40:25] <jenia> yes
[15:40:31] <jenia> yes i definetly do
[15:40:33] <rmurphey> ok so
[15:40:37] <rgenito> saweet! thanks shoky and tw2113 ... changing line 320 helped :)
[15:40:38] <rmurphey> the code you just pasted
[15:40:39] <tw2113> rgenito, try td.datepickerDepartureBookedArrival
[15:40:41] <rmurphey> will log 'foo'
[15:40:45] <rmurphey> after the request is successful
[15:40:45] <jenia> but in the call back, i want to access i variable that ive defined outside
[15:40:59] <jenia> that's what i need
[15:40:59] <rmurphey> yes ... and you can!
[15:41:00] <rmurphey> you are!
[15:41:02] <rmurphey> right now!
[15:41:05] <tw2113> eh, not working for me in firebug, more specificity!
[15:41:19] <jenia> in that example?
[15:41:26] <rmurphey> the code you just pasted *will log 'foo'*
[15:41:34] <rmurphey> as soon as the request is successful
[15:41:39] <jenia> but also send foo* over the network
[15:41:40] <rgenito> tw2113, try refreshing :) works in firefox now... gotta try chrome and IE7 too of course lol
[15:41:50] <rmurphey> it will send x=foo over the network
[15:41:54] <shoky> works @ chrome, rgenito
[15:42:06] <rgenito> saweeet
[15:42:11] <tw2113> i'd be surprised if it wasn't working in any others
[15:42:23] <tw2113> css differences of this nature aren't THAT bad
[15:42:28] <mouses> i have a slider animation that i want to automatically slide every 3 seconds. should i use setTimeout over setInterval?
[15:42:41] <jenia> i need to access a different object in my call back
[15:42:56] <jenia> that object has nothing to do with the information i want to send over the network
[15:43:07] <jenia> how do i achieve that??
[15:43:28] <rmurphey> jenia: the object in the callback has *NOTHING TO DO* with the data you send
[15:43:35] <rmurphey> so just .. .refer to the object you want to refer to!
[15:44:16] <rmurphey> http://jsfiddle.net/FDceD/
[15:44:55] <rmurphey> a function has access to all variables that are defined in the same scope in which the function is defined
[15:45:44] <rmurphey> therefore your callback function has access to any variables that were defined in the same scope
[15:46:10] <rmurphey> so, in http://jsfiddle.net/FDceD/ you can access myObject, myData, window, and lots of other things inside that callback function
[15:46:17] * tw2113 wonders if that's true for php too
[15:46:27] <rmurphey> and what you can access has *nothing to do* with what data you included in the get request
[15:46:40] <tw2113> ignore me
[15:47:00] <rgenito> tw2113, i hear ya :D
[15:47:22] <rmurphey> jenia: i would strongly recommend you pause whatever you're working on and get up to speed on javascript and jquery generally
[15:47:30] <rmurphey> http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/javascript-basics is a good place to start
[15:48:41] <tw2113> nope, doesn't look like scope works quite the same with php, or at least not in my quick test spot
[15:48:44] <Klowner> ergh, looking through jQuery.events, trying to see if there's some way I can call event listeners immediately
[15:48:57] <rmurphey> Klowner: trigger?
[15:49:44] <Klowner> rmurphey: does trigger defer the actual event dispatching until the next javascript tick?
[15:50:01] <rmurphey> no idea
[15:50:58] <Klowner> hrm, my issue is I'm listening for scroll events, performing some calculation, then triggering another event with the calculated results, the receiver of that data seems to receive it after the window has already scrolled
[15:51:07] <Demonen> I'm having trouble with $('selector').on('event',somefunction);   If the full selector path doesn't exist when it's attatched, it doesn't work.  How can I make it work so the event will trigger when the selector exists.
[15:51:14] <Demonen> ?
[15:51:17] <shoky> Klowner: it doesn't
[15:51:29] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/g3GXC/
[15:52:04] <rmurphey> Demonen: read up on event delegation
[15:52:07] <Klowner> shoky: well, hmmm
[15:52:25] <Demonen> rmurphey: Any chance you could be more specific?
[15:52:40] <Klowner> shoky: I must just be doing something stupid then, thanks for the example :)
[15:52:42] <Demonen> I don't mind reading, but any pointers would be great.
[15:52:44] <rmurphey> http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/events
[15:53:04] <rmurphey> see the section on event delegation
[15:53:28] <rmurphey> basically when you make a selection
[15:53:31] <rmurphey> it only selects elements that exist
[15:53:34] <rmurphey> currently
[15:53:51] <rmurphey> so if you want to listen for events on elements that don't yet exist
[15:53:59] <rmurphey> then you bind to a container element
[15:54:01] <Demonen> Ooooh, so $('veryHighUpSelector').on('someEvent','lowerSelector',someFunction);
[15:54:05] <rmurphey> yes
[15:54:16] <Demonen> Excellent, sweet, thanks.
[15:54:18] <shoky> Klowner: uhh but, the scroll event gets triggered after the window has scrolled, anyway
[15:54:25] * Demonen has a new bookmark, too
[15:55:04] <shoky> Klowner: so obviously any other event you trigger from the scroll handler would get triggered after the scroll
[15:55:22] <Pasq89> why geting $('#id').val() doesnt work in .autocomplete? : http://pastebin.com/Wm9P5iuv
[15:56:31] <Demonen> Thanks a bunch rmurphey
[15:59:04] <shoky> Pasq89: if you don't want it to automatically replace the value, then return false from the select callback
[15:59:47] <shoky> Pasq89: but it would be much simpler to just do:  ui.item.value = 'whatever you want';
[16:00:54] <Pasq89> shoky, i want to send parameters for the autocomplete php. i m refering to the $(#id).val for these ids: advsearch_cd_loggedIn_title , ..authors, ..isbn
[16:01:15] <shoky> what does sending parameters have to do with the select event
[16:01:29] <Pasq89> in the source part, not in the select. select part does what i want! :)
[16:01:41] <shoky> ohhhh
[16:02:21] <shoky> there is no special reason for .val() not to work there..
[16:02:27] <Pasq89> and those 3 id's return nothing! tried also $().attr('value') ..
[16:03:29] <shoky> do the selectors work.. without the .val()
[16:03:31] <Pasq89> by the time autocomplete runs, those 3 ids, exist.. but when first page is loaded, they dont exist..
[16:03:52] <Pasq89> this may be the reason?
[16:04:23] <shoky> "the autocomplete runs" when you initialize it, which is this code you've given
[16:04:28] <Pasq89> hmmm... they do work... but...... only in a .live("keydown" .. function...
[16:05:02] <shoky> right.. this code initializes the autocomplete, once..
[16:05:12] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:05:20] <shoky> so those elements should exist when you're calling .autocomplete(...
[16:05:22] <Pasq89> hmm.. when document first loaded?
[16:05:29] <shoky> whenever you're calling .autocomplete
[16:05:42] <Pasq89> so whenever user types in that box?
[16:05:48] <shoky> no.
[16:06:02] <shoky> you call .autocomplete ONCE
[16:06:06] <shoky> not whenver the user types in that box
[16:06:50] <Pasq89> hmm... confused! :)
[16:07:04] <shoky> Pasq89: you can always change the 'source' option  after the autocomplete widget is already initialized
[16:07:09] <shoky> if it needs to change..
[16:07:18] <Krambiorix> hi , i add a new table row but how can i get the index already of the row that's been added?
[16:07:41] <Pasq89> when do i know that autocomplete is inited?
[16:07:45] <Pasq89> how *
[16:07:53] <shoky> Pasq89: it is initialized after the call to .autocomplete(...)
[16:08:23] <sparuvu> hey guys… is there a way to convert  string array like "[1, 2, 3]" to an actual array [1, 2, 3] ?
[16:08:55] <shoky> sparuvu: JSON.parse
[16:09:06] <shoky> or $.parseJSON
[16:09:44] <Krambiorix> how can i generate a unique id with jquery?
[16:10:10] <shoky> var uniq = 0;     ....    var myNewId = uniq++;   ...
[16:10:57] <Pasq89> shoky, so you are saying to change the source part, whenever the 3 ids values change?
[16:12:49] <shoky> Pasq89: change the source option, yes. you could also pass in a callback for your source instead of a URL and have more flexibility there
[16:13:34] <shoky> do you know how to change an option?
[16:13:37] <Pasq89> the callback could be a function that calculates what i want?
[16:13:54] <shoky> yes. calculates, or fetches from somewhere, or whatever
[16:14:17] <Pasq89> shoky, no. i dont. but i googled, and find out how to pass extraParams! i will try the extra params, and if doesnt work, i will try the callback!
[16:14:30] <shoky> eh read the docs
[16:14:36] <shoky> and the examples in the docs
[16:14:40] <shoky> that has all the info you need
[16:14:58] <Pasq89> shoky, you helped me a lot! thank you! :)
[16:15:06] <shoky> yw
[16:15:50] <lethjakman_work> I hooked a <a> up to a $().click in order to set a cookie before th e page changes...is that bad practice?
[16:15:59] <shoky> btw, to change the source option would be smth like:  $('#bla').autocomplete('source', 'newURL...')
[16:18:44] <Pasq89> thank you! hmm recalling autocomplete!
[16:29:14] <Pasq89> shoky, extraParams, didnt worked, neither callback .. so i 've put .autocomplete in .live code... ( the $(id).autocomplete and other ids didnt existed before.. so moving them in a .live function did the trick! :)  )
[16:51:32] <scar> how can i reset a form/empty it completely ?

[16:55:43] <zedro> Hey all, I'm trying to post to a URL in IE7/8/9 and the request is not going through. I get: {"readyState":0,"status":0,"statusText":"Error: Access is denied.\r\n"}  back
[16:55:56] <zedro> Can anyone provide some insight?
[16:56:33] <shoky> JFranks: lol
[16:56:55] <eddiemonge> zedro: maybe access is denied?
[17:01:12] <zedro> eddiemonge: if only! I have $.support.cors = true; happening prior to the request and browsers other than IE have no issues making the call
[17:01:59] <shoky> zedro: IE < 10 doesn't support cors
[17:02:13] <shoky> zedro: and you're not supposed to set $.support.cors yourself
[17:04:51] <shoky> zedro: you should try using the jquery xdr script
[17:07:23] <martisj> morning
[17:07:24] <rainabba> I have a SELECT element with multiple options that are organized in optgroups. I've just discovered that in Chrome $('select#elementId option:selected') is returning two options instead of the one that I've selected and the first of those two is always the first option. I'm not manipulating :selected anywhere but through a manual action in the browser (no code manipulation) and I'm POSITIVE
[17:07:25] <rainabba> that I've only selected one option (even used the keyboard). Anyone see why based on this code?  http://pastebin.com/m4r0Y5sF
[17:08:52] <faLUCE>  hi. I need a dynamically resizable grid, for a web page. Each cell must contain a link to a video. is there anything similar  on github, written in javascript? I found this:  https://github.com/mikefey/Vimeo-Grid   but I'm searching something smarter and not only intended for  vimeo
[17:19:36] <zedro> shoky: Is that the plugin that adds CORS support to IE8+?
[17:26:19] <KorvinSzanto> I'm adding an element to a couple containers at once, how can I make my variable contain all elements rather than just the last?
[17:26:54] <danheberden> ?add @ KorvinSzanto
[17:26:56] <bot-t> KorvinSzanto, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[17:27:26] <KorvinSzanto> danheberden, I can't really trust the selector
[17:28:00] <danheberden> you said you had elements
[17:28:09] <danheberden> and i'm *sure* you clicked the link
[17:28:28] <danheberden> to see that you can use a selector, elements, html, or another jQuery object
[17:31:46] <KorvinSzanto> danheberden, http://jsfiddle.net/ueUbX/
[17:31:58] <KorvinSzanto> sorry if I didn't explain well
[17:34:43] <danheberden> KorvinSzanto: and what are you trind to do?
[17:34:45] <danheberden> *trying
[17:35:11] <KorvinSzanto> I just have a bunch of ephemeral data that I'm displaying, the scope changed a bit and now I need to display in two places
[17:35:26] <KorvinSzanto> I don't have an accurate selector for the objects because they don't really have solid is
[17:35:28] <KorvinSzanto> id's
[17:35:34] <danheberden> appending a dom node does just that - if you append it to one place, and then another
[17:35:35] <danheberden> it will move
[17:35:37] <danheberden> not copy
[17:35:56] <danheberden> i would create the html you need, either manually or using a template
[17:35:57] <KorvinSzanto> it appends both places, it just doesn't update the jquery variable
[17:36:29] <KorvinSzanto> danheberden, I do create the html I need using a template
[17:36:38] <KorvinSzanto> I need to access that dom object later to update it
[17:36:46] <danheberden> maybe i'm just not getting what you're doing
[17:37:08] <KorvinSzanto> So, my dom object D is in two places, but my jquery object only points to the second
[17:37:16] <black_warlock> i dunno whats going on with fiddle tonite
[17:37:24] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/yygp7/41/
[17:37:33] <KorvinSzanto> I was wondering if there was a jquery method that would re populate the jquery object with all duplicate objects or something like that
[17:37:37] <black_warlock> why it says proc() not defined
[17:42:22] <black_warlock> uff
[17:42:38] <black_warlock> wtf i ffel so bad dam i m not understanding
[18:02:18] <scar> it seems when i use jQuery("#can_color_yes").attr('checked', 'checked'); that it overrides user selection AFTER the code is ran-- so if i change the radio AFTER the code is ran, the form submits the selection given by jquery
[18:03:01] <shoky> zedro: something like that yeah.  try including this https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[18:04:48] <shoky> black_warlock: stop using onclick attributes. they are a very old way of doing things
[18:05:12] <black_warlock> but why it says function not defined
[18:05:21] <black_warlock> its a fukin error making me crazy
[18:05:44] <shoky> black_warlock: also what da fook is 'jsonc' ?
[18:06:16] <black_warlock> im gonna use parseJson
[18:06:18] <shoky> black_warlock: because  using  'onclick' attributes means you're in the global (window) scope
[18:06:32] <shoky> and it'll only find things defined in the global scope
[18:07:04] <black_warlock> sorry i dont undrstand
[18:07:17] <black_warlock> a function its there ready to be called on click
[18:07:33] <shoky> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/yygp7/67/

[18:08:30] <shoky> this is: http://jsfiddle.net/yygp7/68/
[18:09:39] <black_warlock> but this shet wont work dam
[18:09:47] <shoky> black_warlock: what is dataType: 'jsonc'  ?
[18:09:47] <black_warlock> im following guides
[18:09:58] <shoky> what guide told you to put jsonc dataType ?
[18:10:09] <black_warlock> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=jsonc
[18:10:16] <shoky> i don't see any guide there
[18:10:24] <shoky> and it looks like json.
[18:10:45] <black_warlock> but there are many types
[18:10:54] <black_warlock> its the first time i try to parse
[18:10:59] <shoky> use dataType: 'json'
[18:11:17] <shoky> and doing data[0] doesn't make sense
[18:11:19] <shoky> it's not an array
[18:11:22] <coldhead> OH THIS COMET WAS THE ONLY MAN I LOVED

[18:13:54] <tw2113> is $ defined up there too?
[18:13:58] <black_warlock> for vime its working
[18:14:01] <black_warlock> viemo
[18:14:02] <shoky> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/yygp7/72/
[18:15:33] <tw2113> wtf, i have java for a syntax highlighter in sublime?
[18:15:56] <black_warlock> how this work ?
[18:15:58] <tw2113> *delete*
[18:16:08] <shoky> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/yygp7/73/
[18:16:09] <black_warlock> how the hell you did
[18:16:15] <shoky> now it gets the image too
[18:16:23] <shoky> black_warlock: i LOOKED at the structure of the data:  http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=jsonc
[18:16:27] <shoky> its so simple.
[18:16:45] <shoky> that is an object (NOT an array) with 2 properties:  apiVersion, and data
[18:16:48] <black_warlock> im looking that bitch since 2 hours
[18:17:09] <shoky> data.data is an object with 5 properties. one of those 5 properties is 'items'
[18:17:15] <shoky> so now we're at data.data.items
[18:17:21] <shoky> data.data.items IS an array.
[18:17:25] <shoky> etc etc etc.
[18:18:12] <black_warlock> and how would you call it without to set array
[18:18:17] <black_warlock> and
[18:18:19] <shoky> huh?
[18:18:23] <black_warlock> why for vimeo works ?
[18:18:31] <shoky> wtf does vimeo have to do with it?
[18:18:36] <black_warlock> ill paste vimeo part one sec
[18:18:36] <shoky> do one thing at a time
[18:18:41] <shoky> no dont paste vimeo
[18:18:44] <shoky> you're doing youtube now
[18:18:45] <shoky> forget vimeo
[18:18:56] <black_warlock> i started from vimeo string
[18:19:01] <shoky> :\
[18:19:05] <tw2113> i'm sure vimeo returns different json data
[18:20:01] <black_warlock> see
[18:20:04] <black_warlock> jsonp
[18:20:09] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/KHxkb/
[18:20:24] <black_warlock> why that works ?
[18:20:32] <shoky> black_warlock: that is TOTALLY unrelated
[18:20:33] <black_warlock> i dont see array defined
[18:20:42] <shoky> black_warlock: focus on ONE thing at a time.
[18:20:59] <black_warlock> okey
[18:21:07] <shoky> black_warlock: vimeo gives a different object, whats hard to understand?
[18:21:14] <black_warlock> i understand there are different type of json
[18:21:20] <shoky> no there are no different types of json
[18:21:26] <shoky> but there are different types of objects
[18:21:30] <shoky> one object can have 3 properties
[18:21:32] <shoky> another can have 10
[18:21:36] <coldhead> there are two types of JSON: valid and invalid
[18:21:44] <shoky> coldhead++
[18:22:01] <black_warlock> look these 2
[18:22:04] <black_warlock> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=json
[18:22:07] <black_warlock> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=jsonc
[18:22:13] <shoky> did you even try to understand how my code worked?
[18:22:21] <shoky> and why yours didn't?
[18:22:26] <black_warlock> im trying
[18:23:44] <shoky> black_warlock: both of those URLS give json data
[18:23:46] <black_warlock> why your code worked ?
[18:23:57] <black_warlock> you addede data.data.items
[18:24:09] <shoky> because my code used the right properties
[18:24:16] <shoky> and didn't treat data as an array
[18:24:46] <black_warlock> so you trasformed it in array ?
[18:24:48] <tw2113> ah, 2 links, so much different content in them
[18:24:56] <shoky> i didn't transform anything, no..
[18:25:09] <shoky> data is not an array
[18:25:10] <black_warlock> but
[18:25:12] <shoky> data.data.items IS
[18:25:25] <black_warlock> items[0].title;
[18:25:30] <shoky> what is items?
[18:25:44] <black_warlock> the json items
[18:25:52] <shoky> which
[18:26:19] <shoky> er
[18:26:28] <black_warlock> "data":
[18:26:32] <shoky> yea cause i did var items = data.data.items;
[18:26:38] <shoky> so items refers to data.data.items
[18:27:10] <shoky> could've just done:  var title = data.data.items[0].title;
[18:27:13] <shoky> same thing
[18:27:17] <shoky> more to write
[18:27:34] <black_warlock> ah
[18:27:50] <black_warlock> but how to do then if
[18:28:16] <black_warlock> it was this json http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=json
[18:28:20] <black_warlock> wait ill tell
[18:28:27] <shoky> :)
[18:29:28] <shoky> black_warlock: i have no idea what this data is.. you need to follow the up-to-date documentation for this API
[18:29:46] <shoky> but without blindly copy-pasting
[18:30:58] <black_warlock> well thats not an old doc
[18:31:11] <black_warlock> but just another type of data
[18:31:19] <shoky> i'm talking about docs, not data
[18:31:24] <black_warlock> there are more infos inside that type jsonc
[18:31:44] <black_warlock> ok ok
[18:32:14] <black_warlock> i ve started today to see some json i dont really know what is it
[18:32:40] <black_warlock> i understand only that is new tecnology to read crosscontents like cml
[18:32:47] <black_warlock> xml
[18:33:34] <shoky> it's a simple way to represent data, yes. the same way that is used by javascript
[18:33:56] <shoky> more or less.
[18:37:14] <aca20031> http://st0rm.net/demo.php  -- Why is $('#news').offset().top giving me 40? Its definitely more than 40 pixels from the top of the document
[18:37:25] <aca20031> being that its below the slider
[18:37:31] <coldhead> ?offset
[18:37:32] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[18:37:37] <BillCriswell> Dammit. Just thought I almost had a way to detect if a device is capable of making a phone call. =(
[18:37:40] <coldhead> hmm
[18:37:43] <black_warlock> thanks man
[18:37:55] <coldhead> what was your idea, BillCriswell ?
[18:38:10] <aca20031> was i supposed to learn something from that coldhead?
[18:38:30] <shoky> aca20031: it's giving me 491
[18:38:35] <aca20031> is it?
[18:38:37] <shoky> it is.
[18:38:39] <aca20031> ive refrshed a million times
[18:38:42] <shoky> from the console
[18:38:43] <aca20031> Location: 40
[18:38:58] <shoky> yeah Location: 40
[18:39:00] <mmealling> in a sortable, what is the difference between the out vs removed event? If I call .remove() on one of the items in the Sortable is there an event triggered?
[18:39:12] <shoky> probably at the time you write that out it's not in it's final position yet
[18:39:19] <aca20031> hmm...
[18:39:22] <aca20031> thats problematic.
[18:39:31] <coldhead> i was just consulting the docs to make sure offset() is relevant to the document, aca20031
[18:39:34] <BillCriswell> coldhead: I was playing with Adobe Edge Inspect and I inspected the link that webkit automatically creates around strings that look like phone numbers and found a "x-apple-data-detectors-type" attribute.
[18:39:36] <coldhead> no cause for alarm
[18:39:51] <aca20031> k coldhead, sometimes people do that and dont respond any further expecting me to read it and learn something new, which I didnt that time ;P
[18:39:54] <coldhead> ah, interesting BillCriswell
[18:39:54] <aca20031> so i was just checking
[18:40:18] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Yeah, I was hoping to do $('a[x-apple-data-detectors-type=telephone]') but it takes a bit for those links to kick on I guess.
[18:40:25] <coldhead> very little chance of that here, aca20031. #jQuery is much more likely to go on and on and on about your problem for hours after you've solved it
[18:40:31] <joe-node0> Hi all, I have a json comparison with which I'd appreciate some feedback
[18:40:33] <coldhead> even after you're offline or dead in your cold cold grave
[18:40:47] <aca20031> well thats depressing
[18:41:06] <coldhead> it's okay, people will bring flowers
[18:41:10] <coldhead> for a while anyway
[18:41:34] <dlam> is there a betwer way to do...   $(foo + ', ' + bar).dostuff()    ?
[18:41:48] <dlam> e.g.  i want to perform dostuff() on both foo and bar elements
[18:42:13] <coldhead> $([foo, bar].join(',')) // arguably
[18:42:22] <coldhead> ?add @ dlam
[18:42:23] <bot-t> dlam, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[18:42:24] <BillCriswell> dostuff($('select, input'))
[18:42:33] <joe-node0> The debate is between two alternate ways of encoding meaning in json, one using nested structures with simple keywords and another using minimal nesting while incorporating more dense information in the object 'keys' using some control strings as signals.
[18:42:36] <dlam> haha thx thx
[18:43:19] <joe-node0> I have two gists with 'legends' which summarize the data structures.
[18:43:21] <aca20031> is there anyway to wait until its loaded enough so that #news IS in its final position?
[18:43:25] <shoky> aca20031: you're init'ing the sliders stuff on a body onload
[18:43:30] <aca20031> except for a naive setTimeout and holding my breath?
[18:43:34] <shoky> aca20031: and only there do they get their final height
[18:43:37] <BillCriswell> I wish there was an easy way to just ask like "Hey browser, can you do anything with tel: links? No? That's ok."
[18:43:40] <coldhead> joe-node0: i generally prefer richer structure, simpler keys
[18:43:47] <aca20031> shoky right, whats my best alternative then?
[18:44:03] <joe-node0> Here is contender A: http://bit.ly/nd0_Data_A
[18:44:13] <joe-node0> and here is contender B: http://bit.ly/nd0_Data-B
[18:44:51] <coldhead> contender B is more readable for me
[18:44:55] <joe-node0> Hmmmmm
[18:45:16] <coldhead> but it's my first day using jQuery so don't take my advice
[18:45:44] <shoky> aca20031:  remove the onload and put that call to init_sliders inside your doc ready, before you need that offset
[18:45:47] <joe-node0> the 'legends' won't be used in production, that was added simply to satisfy a "but if your encoding didn't have a legend nobody would understand it" argument.
[18:45:57] <coldhead> i think it's simpler to traverse a rich structure than pick apart the keys to work out what you'r elooking at
[18:46:15] <joe-node0> yes, that's the argument against the first model
[18:46:34] <joe-node0> that we would have to spend some initial time writing 'Gasp!' regex methods...
[18:46:54] <joe-node0> I may have just blown my impartiality though...
[18:47:10] <coldhead> faintly relevant: "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures." http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html
[18:47:31] <joe-node0> Hmmmm
[18:51:27] <coldhead> songs for the end of time
[18:51:53] <joe-node0> well then, back to work I go
[18:52:31] <black_warlock> YAYAYAYAAAAYYYYYYYY THANKS
[18:52:46] <black_warlock> YAYAYAYAAAAYYYYYYYY THANKS shoky
[18:53:24] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all takea  five minute break
[18:53:27] <shoky> *confetti*
[18:53:46] <ngharo> ^5
[18:55:51] <questiondude> hi guys. i am loading a website(including new js) into a div. thus, the $(document).ready is not executed in the newly loaded scripts. So I guess I have to call a function of the new script after the callback of .load(url...) is executed. But when I try to do that it tells me that the function is not know. Anybody has an idea how to solve this?
[18:55:58] <rgenito> oooh man/
[18:56:49] <black_warlock> shoky CHEEEEERRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSS
[18:57:20] <coldhead> questiondude: the JS in the page you are loading will be stripped out
[18:57:39] <coldhead> you might try to $.getScript() load the external JS
[18:57:43] <coldhead> once the HTML is done
[18:59:07] <questiondude> What does stripped out mean? Ok, so I have to load the js. manually and then call the function using the handle of the script. And there is no possibility to let the script execute its function by itself after its loaded (like document.ready)?
[19:01:14] <black_warlock> knowing this makes me very happy
[19:01:24] <black_warlock> because now i can make my TV !
[19:01:41] <coldhead> no questiondude, jQuery wants you to explicitly run that JS yourself
[19:01:41] <rgenito> http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/property-compare/ <-- on IE7, does anyone see why "Email" (top-right) is smashed against some other text?
[19:12:15] <rgenito> screw you guys... i'm goin home!
[19:16:51] <black_warlock> why cant print this
[19:18:32] <black_warlock> var url = items[0].player.content;
[19:18:49] <black_warlock> ir player.dafault
[19:23:38] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Usually pretty good at this but don't have IE7 and trying to do it through Browse Stack is being a bitch.
[19:24:01] <rgenito> BillCriswell, have any virtualbox's setup? :D
[19:24:30] <rgenito> right now i'm kind of re-doing the css... i can see that whoever did the css previously was just... didn't know css =\
[19:24:38] <BillCriswell> I do not. We usually have a few computers at work for this stuff.
[19:25:06] <shoky> rgenito: ask the question _after_ you re-do it. why make us go through your hassle?
[19:27:15] <BillCriswell> I went through the days of IE5 for Mac... IE7 is a dream compared to that.
[19:28:02] <rgenito> shoky: no one's asking YOU to go through my hassle :P
[19:28:33] <shoky> it's just.. you obviously know what the next step is
[19:29:17] <rgenito> mmm. k.
[19:29:45] <BillCriswell> So sad a[x-apple-data-detectors-type=telephone]  didn't work =(
[19:29:45] <shoky> ok sorry donno why im being mean
[19:29:47] <rgenito> BillCriswell, wow, working with IE5 for the Mac eh? i bet that was fun :)
[19:29:59] <rgenito> shoky probably cause computers are irritating? :)
[19:30:14] <shoky> it's coldhead
[19:30:17] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Helping in this IRC channel gets stressful at times as well. =)
[19:30:21] <rgenito> ...just the electric glow of them sees to stir things up...
[19:31:55] <rgenito> shoky i appreciate your apology :) ty
[19:32:11] <shoky> ;]
[19:32:22] <BillCriswell> People will ask for help, you'll give them 5 solutions, they'll kind of listen and expect you to do the work for them
[19:32:24] <shoky> FWIW, on IETester it looks fine :\
[19:32:46] <rgenito> BillCriswell, oh man... i'd LOVE to hire someone to do these CSS fixes instead of me lol
[19:34:09] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Haha, wish I had someone to hand work like that off to.
[19:34:28] <rgenito> hehe
[19:35:31] <shoky> uhm
[19:35:37] <shoky> looks fine in browserstack too
[19:36:16] <shoky> rgenito: what squishing do you mean?
[19:36:23] <gf3> wat
[19:36:29] <BillCriswell> shoky: The "Search Results" and text below it was jumped together.
[19:36:35] <BillCriswell> jumbled*
[19:36:46] <bot-t> wat
[19:36:51] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[19:37:06] <shoky> and its not anymore..?
[19:37:27] <BillCriswell> Unless he fixed it already.
[19:38:12] <BillCriswell> shoky: Just looked, still broke.
[19:38:15] <shoky> huh.
[19:38:43] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://i.imgur.com/udIQj.png
[19:39:08] <shoky> looks same as in chrome here..
[19:39:22] <shoky> not your screenshot, that is
[19:39:49] <BillCriswell> shoky: Weird.
[19:40:10] <BillCriswell> Wonder if whatever machine you're on at Browser Stack has chromeframe or something?
[19:40:21] <BillCriswell> Not sure how BrowserStack actually works... but yeah. Maybe haha
[19:40:53] <Krinkle> I don't think they install chrome frame on the IE machines, that would defeat the purpose
[19:41:00] <Krinkle> (unless you want to test chrome frame)
[19:41:10] <shoky> i just chose winxp + IE7  everything default
[19:41:16] <BillCriswell> Krinkle: I was thinking maybe someone else could have run it in some way?
[19:41:28] <BillCriswell> I really don't know. Just throwing ideas out haha.
[19:41:38] <Krinkle> BillCriswell: what do you mean? someone installed it on the VM before you started using the VM?
[19:41:45] <Krinkle> They are destroyed after you close them.
[19:41:54] <Krinkle> and a new one is spawn for every session
[19:42:10] <BillCriswell> Krinkle: Haha I did just say I have no idea how it works.
[19:42:15] <Krinkle> np :)
[19:42:28] <BillCriswell> It's just weird that shoky's IE7 on BrowserStack is showing it right.
[19:42:30] <black_warlock> shoky why doesnt read var url = items[0].player.content;
[19:42:31] <shoky> hell, it looks fine in IE6 too
[19:42:48] <shoky> just fine
[19:43:11] <shoky> black_warlock: how tf should i know?
[19:43:24] <BillCriswell> shoky: I wish my clients were using those versions of IE lol
[19:43:29] <BillCriswell> He's being awful quiet...
[19:43:30] <shoky> heh
[19:43:35] <black_warlock> http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=1bMR83ZI7m8&max-results=1&v=2&alt=jsonc
[19:43:35] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/EoNYB.png
[19:44:01] <black_warlock> on var url = items[0].player.content;   it says undefined
[19:44:02] <Krinkle> BillCriswell: I can tell you that it doesn't work with camera's hidden in peoples houses and relaying the feed over satellite to their data center and then to your computer (it would detect if anyone is at the computer and if not send out a rat to walk there and type in the url after it walks out of view and starts the feed)
[19:44:07] <Krinkle> .. (it would detect if anyone is at the computer and if not send out a rat to walk there and type in the url after it walks out of view and starts the feed)
[19:44:35] <BillCriswell> Krinkle: I'm not that clueless about it.
[19:44:41] <shoky> im trying to resize the window and everything, nothing causes it to squish
[19:45:01] <Krinkle> that would be kind of amazing though. secret crowdsourced browserstack
[19:45:14] <Krinkle> dont waste idle computer time
[19:45:34] <Krinkle> (aside from all the security issues with that)
[19:45:49] <BillCriswell> Security scmischmoirty.
[19:46:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: Weird.
[19:47:16] <BillCriswell> shoky: I bet rgenito went to bed.
[19:48:44] <rgenito> nope
[19:48:48] <rgenito> still werkin on this ;(
[19:49:01] <shoky> maybe he's switching versions each time you and I are checking it
[19:49:06] <rgenito> in fact..... http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/property-compare/
[19:49:10] <rgenito> WHAT! you guys are still lookin at it? :D lol
[19:49:16] <rgenito> cool ;)
[19:49:21] <rgenito> <-- a little embarrassed too
[19:49:41] <rgenito> i'm trying to figure out how to center the text inside a div... -_-
[19:55:16] <black_warlock> im sleeping now thats all :D
[19:55:35] <black_warlock> but that mobile link its special link for mobiles ?
[19:55:44] <shoky> ?
[19:55:59] <black_warlock> "mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v=1bMR83ZI7m8"}
[19:56:11] <BillCriswell> Looks like a clown.
[19:56:13] <shoky> look at the API docs.
[19:56:16] <BillCriswell> Honk honk.
[19:56:46] <shoky> probably it has something to do with mobiles. good guess..
[19:56:56] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgCpvoj1aKk
[19:57:03] <black_warlock> but this is amazing dam
[19:57:36] <black_warlock> is there a way to get all contents in a shot ?
[19:57:38] <shoky> heh that was such a lame movie ;P
[19:57:44] <BillCriswell> I wish there was a service that you can send a user agent sting to and it just spits back what the device is capable of.
[19:57:48] <black_warlock> for i=o
[19:57:54] <BillCriswell> shoky: It was scary as fuck when I was 8.
[19:58:02] <shoky> yap
[19:58:04] <black_warlock> dont you like that vid ?
[19:58:16] <shoky> the book was much nicer
[19:58:19] <shoky> tho.. too long
[19:58:43] <BillCriswell> shoky: Never read the book.
[19:59:14] <shoky> can't really recommend it, it's not one of his best IMO

[20:01:31] <shoky> yea ;]
[20:01:32] <landswipe1> very basic jquery question.
[20:01:40] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha, defintely not my style.
[20:01:46] <shoky> i just saw it recently for the first time
[20:01:51] <landswipe1> what is the equivalent of this: var done = document.getElementById("done");
[20:01:56] <landswipe1> var done = $("#done");
[20:02:01] <wisefool> #("#done")
[20:02:10] <wisefool> $("#done") lol
[20:02:13] <landswipe1> i tried the $("#done") but i'm missing something basic ;)
[20:02:21] <wisefool> sneh
[20:02:27] <muffinrecon> done
[20:02:28] <muffinrecon> smh
[20:02:35] <wisefool> omg muffins
[20:02:38] <shoky> $(document).ready ?
[20:02:38] <wisefool> hi der
[20:02:39] <muffinrecon> omg the fool
[20:02:45] <shoky> er nvm
[20:02:50] <muffinrecon> wus poppin
[20:02:52] <wisefool> $(document).ready is for
[20:02:54] <wisefool> cray ppl
[20:03:01] <muffinrecon> crayola
[20:03:06] <wisefool> i only use it 200 times a day
[20:03:29] <wisefool> var done = document.getElementById("done");
[20:03:34] <wisefool> $("#done").get()
[20:03:35] <BillCriswell> cray?
[20:03:36] * shoky smells cats
[20:03:50] <muffinrecon> cray
[20:03:52] <muffinrecon>  =
[20:03:53] <wisefool> if in your context i think your dong
[20:03:54] <muffinrecon> cray
[20:03:56] <wisefool> what your doing
[20:04:03] <wisefool> your looking for the actual dom element
[20:04:06] <wisefool> not the jquery element
[20:04:16] <landswipe1> ah thanks wisefool ;)
[20:04:21] <wisefool> mhmm
[20:04:25] <BillCriswell> What just happened in here?
[20:04:33] <muffinrecon> inception
[20:04:33] <shoky> big black cats
[20:04:35] <wisefool> some cray shit
[20:04:36] <wisefool> mang
[20:04:38] <relipse> how do i make the jqueryui dialog look nice and small and compact instead of all big
[20:04:48] <wisefool> you do
[20:04:56] <wisefool> $("#div").dialog()
[20:04:59] <wisefool> and stuff
[20:05:01] <landswipe1> actually that didn't work :(
[20:05:05] <wisefool> :
[20:05:06] <wisefool> (
[20:05:22] <muffinrecon> <?php echo "HAI"?>
[20:05:25] <muffinrecon> try that
[20:05:28] <landswipe1> hehe
[20:05:32] <wisefool> .get() gets you the actual dom element in javascript not the jQ element
[20:05:34] <wisefool> u sure
[20:05:58] <wisefool> actually i could be so wrong
[20:06:14] <wisefool> i pretty sure its .get() though
[20:06:17] <wisefool> paste some code
[20:06:19] <landswipe1> yeah...
[20:06:23] <wisefool> i hook it up
[20:06:36] <wisefool> pastebin that shit we will work it out
[20:06:38] <wisefool> stat
[20:06:49] <landswipe1>           	//var done = document.getElementById("done");
[20:06:49] <landswipe1>           	var done = $("#done").get();
[20:06:49] <landswipe1>           	done.innerHTML = '(' + Math.round(finish - start) + ' ms)';
[20:06:54] <shoky> relipse: .ui-widget {    font-size:0.8em;  }?
[20:07:00] <shoky> minus the question mark
[20:07:00] <landswipe1> alternate the comment on first two lines
[20:07:04] <ryanneuf_> landswipe1: see ?paste
[20:07:04] <bot-t> landswipe1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:07:09] <wisefool> damn
[20:07:13] <landswipe1> ah ok ;)
[20:07:28] <BillCriswell> landswipe1: $('#done').html('(' + Math.round(finish - start) + ' ms)');
[20:07:40] <wisefool> hell yes
[20:07:47] <wisefool> .html()
[20:07:49] <wisefool> fa sho
[20:07:51] <wisefool> you are the man bill
[20:08:06] <muffinrecon> wow
[20:08:11] <wisefool> only problem is the
[20:08:13] <wisefool> ' 's
[20:08:36] <landswipe1> bill, that worked.
[20:08:59] <wisefool> nice
[20:09:02] <BillCriswell> landswipe1: Grooooooovy.
[20:09:55] <wisefool> note to self.. .get() + .innerHTML != $("#name").html("...")
[20:10:30] <landswipe1> so why did .get not work?
[20:10:37] <wisefool> good question
[20:10:43] <shoky> ?get
[20:10:44] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[20:11:02] <shoky> _elements_
[20:11:02] <wisefool> .get should get the relevent html dom object
[20:11:11] <wisefool> which would have .innerHTML
[20:11:15] <wisefool> im confuse
[20:11:16] <shoky> an element has
[20:11:22] <shoky> elementS doesnt.
[20:11:22] <BillCriswell> wisefool: You want ​$('#done').get(0).innerHTML = 'Ha!';​​​​​​​​
[20:11:28] <wisefool> ah
[20:11:30] <wisefool> get(0)
[20:11:36] <landswipe1> doh ;)
[20:11:39] <wisefool> bleh
[20:11:40] <shoky> .get() is an array
[20:11:40] <landswipe1> yeah that did the trick
[20:11:44] <wisefool> damn
[20:11:49] <wisefool> thanks bill
[20:11:49] <landswipe1> ;) cool thanks guys
[20:11:56] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[20:11:58] <wisefool> forgot the array part
[20:12:19] <wisefool> dom is fun isnt it
[20:12:21] <shoky> $('#done')[0] is shorteer btw
[20:12:38] <wisefool> shouldnt you go for $("#done").each
[20:12:42] <shoky> huh
[20:12:42] <wisefool> if your expecting multiples
[20:12:48] <shoky> if you're querying for an id
[20:12:52] <shoky> then you shouldn't be expecting multiples
[20:12:54] <wisefool> [0]
[20:12:55] <wisefool> mmmm
[20:13:08] <shoky> a jquery object is a collection
[20:13:12] <wisefool> yep
[20:13:21] <shoky> so [0] gets the first
[20:13:23] <wisefool> yep
[20:13:31] <wisefool> but how you know its only 1
[20:13:40] <wisefool> ids should be unique yes
[20:13:41] <shoky> because id's are unique
[20:13:47] <wisefool> but who knows
[20:13:51] <shoky> me?
[20:13:53] <wisefool> ftw!
[20:13:57] <wisefool> hah
[20:14:01] <wisefool> all good
[20:14:23] <shoky> anyway if you're expecting more than one then just use .html
[20:14:23] <wisefool> i wouldnt use .get() in any circumstance in my typical programming just saying
[20:14:28] <shoky> that's what jquery is for..
[20:14:33] <wisefool> jQ is the shit
[20:14:37] <muffinrecon> ^werd
[20:14:41] <wisefool> :D
[20:15:00] <wisefool> i particularly appreciate jQUI
[20:15:13] <black_warlock> o my god i was dieng
[20:15:20] <wisefool> dont die
[20:15:35] * wisefool pays for a doctor to breathe oxygen into you
[20:15:39] <black_warlock> i have found a js code into the source code of a page

[20:16:43] <black_warlock> but hell they cant do that
[20:16:54] <wisefool> $("#data-unit-id").val()
[20:16:59] <tomshreds> If anyone has time, could someone check this please? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12738897/multiple-div-creation-destruction-bug-with-jquery Thanks!
[20:17:26] <rgenito> wisefool: but how do i know which unit-id to grab? =\
[20:17:34] <wisefool> how many do you have

[20:21:15] <wisefool> c
[20:21:16] <muffinrecon> everybody using jquery
[20:21:16] <wisefool> o
[20:21:17] <wisefool> u
[20:21:17] <wisefool> l
[20:21:18] <wisefool> d
[20:21:19] <wisefool> be
[20:21:21] <wisefool> idk
[20:21:26] <wisefool> ok your RtsCompare function
[20:21:33] <wisefool> with the del-rental class
[20:21:42] <wisefool> <span class="del-rental" data-unit-id="<?=$prop->unit_id?>">
[20:21:44] <wisefool> you click it and you get
[20:21:47] <wisefool> this.data
[20:21:48] <wisefool> unit-id
[20:21:53] <wisefool> prop->unit_id?
[20:21:54] <wisefool> wut
[20:21:56] <rgenito> well, this.data isn't defined... that doesn't work hehe
[20:21:58] <gnarf> wisefool: please check the signal to noise ratio in your enter keystrokes, thanks
[20:22:01] <wisefool> define it mang
[20:22:04] <rgenito> i'm trying to get the unit-id for the link that they clicked
[20:22:10] <rgenito> and i dont know how to define it properly =
[20:22:11] <rgenito> =\
[20:22:16] <rgenito> <--- still learning
[20:22:19] <wisefool> gnarf you are totally right, if you would like me to stfu please press 1
[20:22:27] <wisefool> and <enter>
[20:22:34] <gnarf> wisefool: 1
[20:22:37] <wisefool> thx
[20:22:41] * wisefool kills himself
[20:22:41] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Is the unit id on the element that is getting clicked.
[20:23:04] <rgenito> hmm, actually no... the link is getting clicked
[20:23:05] <scar> it seems when i use jQuery("#can_color_yes").attr('checked', 'checked'); that it overrides user selection AFTER the code is ran-- so if i change the radio AFTER the code is ran, the form submits the selection given by jquery
[20:23:27] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Might want to look into closest().
[20:23:57] <rgenito> BillCriswell, or maybe i should just put the data- into the 'a' tag?
[20:24:06] <gnarf> ?demo @rgenito
[20:24:07] <bot-t> rgenito, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:24:14] <wisefool> hmm
[20:24:17] <rgenito> gnarf i have one -_-
[20:24:27] <gnarf> rgenito: re-link please
[20:24:49] * rgenito observes yet another person who uses a bot to remind him of mindless suggestions that he has already fulfilled
[20:25:00] <rgenito> http://pastie.org/private/mv0wgt4omysdersfsbnjg
[20:25:07] <gnarf> rgenito: that is not a "working demo"
[20:25:07] <rgenito> ^-- link to the demo is on there :D
[20:25:07] <wisefool> no
[20:25:10] <wisefool> thats a no go
[20:25:20] <rgenito> gnarf click the link and you'll find the working demo
[20:25:33] <BillCriswell> rgenito: http://jsfiddle.net/pJBzR/ looking for something along these lines?
[20:25:33] <wisefool> :/
[20:25:37] <wisefool> he wants jsfiddle
[20:25:38] <wisefool> not pastie
[20:25:39] <rgenito> to be care... it isn't easy to find: View at: http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/property-compare/
[20:25:46] <rgenito> oh, jsfiddle eh?
[20:25:47] <gnarf> gotcha - sry
[20:25:55] <gnarf> jsfiddle is nice
[20:26:04] <gnarf> but i guess i can dive into code with ya
[20:26:05] <wisefool> jsfiddle yes every version of framework
[20:26:08] <wisefool> in a single place
[20:26:17] <rgenito> WHOA @_@ jsfiddle rules
[20:26:22] <wisefool> w h o
[20:26:23] <wisefool> a
[20:26:25] <wisefool> lol
[20:26:46] <rgenito> whoa is pronounced like "woe" btw wisefool :D
[20:26:50] <wisefool> thx
[20:27:03] <rgenito> not like "hooo hahhh"...got yew all in check
[20:27:14] <gnarf> rgenito: okay - so looking at the link in the demo, i can't figure out how to "get some search results" selected
[20:27:16] <rgenito> BillCriswell, that's exactly what i'm looking for :) ty
[20:27:37] <wisefool> im so totally toasted them im about to wrote $("#fuckit").html("I am going to sleep
[20:27:41] <wisefool> and some ");
[20:27:48] <BillCriswell> rgenito: I think you're actually trying for siblings, not parents. http://jsfiddle.net/pJBzR/1/ could help.
[20:27:49] <wisefool> wrote = write
[20:28:11] <rgenito> gnarf ... yaaaa... basically, gotta click "home", then "view all rentals", then one of the rentals has an "Add to My Rentals" link..........it's pretty crappy :)
[20:28:12] <gnarf> rgenito: P.S. - data-* attribs rule
[20:28:15] <gnarf> rgenito: http://jsfiddle.net/pJBzR/2/
[20:28:30] <rgenito> gnarf, yes, they do rule :D
[20:28:50] <gnarf> BillCriswell: good catch on that one, i was kinda lost in the pastebin :)
[20:29:18] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I'm usually really bad at that haha.
[20:29:22] <BillCriswell> I got lucky.
[20:29:23] <rgenito> BillCriswell, won't jsfiddle /1 ruin the other links i have on the page?
[20:29:41] <BillCriswell> rgenito: Yes.
[20:29:56] <jrockjiggz> I'll just leave this here.. http://jsperf.com/
[20:29:56] <wisefool> :/
[20:29:58] <gnarf> rgenito: can you paste your html sample, and a sample click event in a fiddle?
[20:30:00] <BillCriswell> You can do $('.some-common-parent a') instead of $('a') though.
[20:30:26] <wisefool> .property
[20:30:30] <rgenito> BillCriswell, oooh ya, i could do $('.del-rental a') :D
[20:30:40] <BillCriswell> Toadilly.
[20:30:43] <rgenito> gnarf i'll try
[20:31:02] <rgenito> oh wait... i can just grab the sample from the actual site.. hehe
[20:31:07] <wisefool> hm
[20:31:11] <wisefool> rgenito mang
[20:31:12] <BillCriswell> Whatever gnarf suggest, you should totally abide by, cause dude is wise.
[20:31:17] <wisefool> fix it
[20:31:21] <rgenito> nice
[20:31:32] <gnarf> wisefool: plz? less noise?
[20:31:42] * wisefool turns down teh noise

[20:33:44] <rgenito> LOL "oh sht made me spit my drink"
[20:34:18] <rgenito> aww i was really enjoying wisefool's company ;(
[20:34:26] <rgenito> http://jsfiddle.net/pJBzR/3/
[20:34:30] <black_warlock> awwwwwwwwww super sukkio
[20:35:08] <rgenito> hehe whoops, i have a feeling my paste needed moar jabascripts :)
[20:35:20] <black_warlock> anyone knows how to put a var into fckeditor instance ?
[20:35:48] <black_warlock> im reading this but what about jq
[20:35:51] <black_warlock> http://docs.cksource.com/FCKeditor_2.x/Developers_Guide/JavaScript_API
[20:36:32] <black_warlock> $('#summary').val('<img src="'+imgUrl+'" />');
[20:36:43] <gnarf> so hey rgenito before you go much further
[20:36:53] <gnarf> let me mention "reduce" --
[20:37:01] <gnarf> boil it down to only what is important
[20:37:24] <rgenito> gnarf, BillCriswell, btw both of your examples were very helpful :)
[20:37:35] <gnarf> rgenito: BillCriswell had a "reduced" version
[20:37:43] <gnarf> thats why it was useful :)
[20:38:10] <rgenito> gnarf, actually no...it was helpful because i didn't know to use $(this), nor did i know of the closest() function
[20:38:15] <rgenito> :D
[20:38:26] <rgenito> the only thing i wrote on that entire page...
[20:38:31] <rgenito> is the RtsCompare
[20:40:09] <rgenito> man, i love jquery so much... i cant wait to get better with it :D
[20:40:44] <rgenito> it's pretty awesome what you can do... and the newer, common coding "patterns" (i dont remember what else to call them) are pretty sweet
[20:41:58] <gnarf> patterns is the right term
[20:42:17] <gnarf> best-practices another, for a small group of those patterns, as opposed to the anti-patterns :)
[20:42:41] <rgenito> ah yes, "best practices"
[20:42:51] <rgenito> heya, do you know any websites on CSS / javascript / jquery best practices? :D
[20:42:54] <Lurzino> hello everyone! :)
[20:43:00] <rgenito> or "UI" best practices for today's web world? :D
[20:43:00] <gnarf> ?learn
[20:43:00] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:43:01] <gnarf> ?101
[20:43:02] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[20:43:04] <rgenito> i'd love to even get a book about it
[20:43:12] <slaeke> hey all
[20:43:18] <rgenito> gnarf, what if like... i'm not new to javascript? -_-
[20:43:20] <gnarf> rgenito: google has some good video things
[20:43:25] <rgenito> then learn jquery? :D
[20:43:29] <gnarf> rgenito: you should read eloquent anyway
[20:43:32] <slaeke> hey all, i know this isn't the right channel for this question, but I'm wondering where I might get some help with a chrome extension other than the online documentation...just trying to get some advice
[20:43:34] <gnarf> on html/css stuff
[20:44:13] <gnarf> slaeke: i imagine there is a google group somewhere for extension developers, otherwise perhaps stack overflow
[20:44:25] <slaeke> ive searched all over
[20:44:33] <slaeke> both the docs, SO, and google groups
[20:44:45] <slaeke> and cant find the answer to my questions anywhere :(
[20:44:50] <slaeke> been searching for several days
[20:44:52] <rgenito> gnarf, thanks a BUNCH for these links... i really appreciate it! :)
[20:44:56] <gnarf> slaeke: why not ask / post to the groups?
[20:45:13] <slaeke> i dont even know where I could go to find someone that has ever written an extension before
[20:45:20] <gnarf> rgenito: i read eloquent about once every few months when someone else wants to know something :)
[20:45:23] <slaeke> i have, awaiting response, just trying other avenues...heh
[20:45:30] <shoky> uh. i've written an extension
[20:45:39] <shoky> a really simple one tho
[20:45:42] <slaeke> nice
[20:45:49] <slaeke> i want to write a really simple one too
[20:45:57] <slaeke> just trying to figure out if what i want to do is even possible...
[20:46:01] <slaeke> shoky, PM me?
[20:46:10] <slaeke> so i dont fill up this channel with the wrong topic...lol
[20:46:21] <Lurzino> I have this code example http://pastebin.com/BhwdeUKg , since I want to select by code option items and each select is populate by change event of previous select, in openItem function once I selected the option item of products select it doesn't bind the change event to populate the next select about categories...could I have done something wrong? Thanks in advance to everyone! :)
[20:46:23] <shoky> oks
[20:52:32] <Lurzino> I tried also to do: $("#selectproducts").val(data.Ref_products_ID.toString()).attr('selected', 'selected').change(); since I have already code in change() event which should populate next select but it doesn't...
[20:52:36] <Lurzino> any idea?
[20:52:46] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: First off I'd close up that third <select>
[20:53:41] <Lurzino> ah yes yes it is already just I pasted there just to show which selects I have
[20:55:15] <truedon> hey guys I want to add a text input search to a drop down, combine them in one so it is possible to text search the contents of the drop down and also press the down arrow and see
[20:55:20] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: Anything odd about the data being sent? You might have to encode that $('#selectproducts').val()
[20:56:00] <Lurzino> BillCriswell you mean data.Ref_products_ID.toString() ?
[20:56:21] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: Put console.log(data); in the $.post success callbacks and make sure it's what you expect.
[20:57:24] <BillCriswell> truedon: I always thought this was pretty damn sweet: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[20:57:56] <truedon> BillCriswell: Nice one man thanks
[20:58:02] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[20:58:11] <scar> when processing a form via ajax, how can i grab all the variables in the form?
[20:58:30] <BillCriswell> scar: How do you want to grab them?
[20:58:38] <rgenito> with jquery, is there a way to do a POST ?
[20:58:43] <rgenito> ....but to actually ... go to that post site?
[20:58:44] <Lurzino> BillCriswell where I have alert ( 'passing 1' ); I already alerted the data.Ref_products_ID.toString() and it returned me right value of option to select and in fact I can see on the browser the product option correctly selected
[20:58:46] <rgenito> (not an ajax post)
[20:59:08] <scar> BillCriswell: i need to grab them via jquery so i can pass to php
[20:59:17] <BillCriswell> rgenito: You don't use javascript at all if you just want to do a regular post.
[20:59:35] <rgenito> aw crap, you're right
[20:59:39] <rgenito> i'm not thinking :) hahaha
[21:00:11] <BillCriswell> scar: Think you just want serializeArray().
[21:00:30] <scar> BillCriswell: how do i access the $_POST array in jquery?
[21:00:33] <scar> per-se
[21:01:50] <rgenito> ...is there some javascript that will refresh the current page? :D
[21:02:07] <BillCriswell> scar: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:02:08] <rgenito> ...besides window.location = 'http://www.thewebsite.com/location'; ?
[21:03:14] <gnarf> rgenito / BillCriswell - you can submit a hidden <form> to simulate a non-ajax POST request that would actually change pages
[21:03:58] <rgenito> ty gnarf, right when i thought of that... i realized it was actually an ajax request that i did need
[21:04:03] <rgenito> but then i need to refresh the page for the user
[21:04:10] <gnarf> rgenito: location.reload()
[21:04:13] <rgenito> know of an easy way to refresh the page?
[21:04:16] <rgenito> AWESOME @_@
[21:04:17] <rgenito> ty
[21:05:15] <Lurzino> so BillCriswell , no hints about why it doesn't bind the change event since first select's option is correctly selected ?
[21:06:37] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: This is kind of hard to figure out without live code.
[21:07:10] <BillCriswell> I just wanted to make sure data actually had list items in it.
[21:07:51] <Lurzino> uhm I could jfiddle but the problem is population of selects is done querying a database...
[21:08:06] <empires> f
[21:08:12] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: That's why I was curious as to what you get when you console.log(data)
[21:08:14] <Lurzino> at least do you have a possible alternative to bind('change') to populate next select and select option?
[21:10:13] <black_warlock> gud night peeps
[21:10:17] <black_warlock> thanks for helps
[21:10:24] <bubu> anyone have an idea why my submit() handler is firing more than once?
[21:10:45] <black_warlock> it happens on firefox
[21:10:56] <BillCriswell> I think the change event is happening.
[21:11:08] <kibab> bubu: do you get anything useful out of the stack trace?
[21:11:20] <BillCriswell> You're populating the options in the select, not the select itself so you shouldn't have to rebind anything.
[21:11:27] <bubu> im not looking at a stack trace, im stepping through my javascript
[21:11:46] <bubu> i set a breakpoint on my first line inside the submit handler
[21:11:58] <scar> how do i pause between actions? i want to show one thing, delay, then hide it.
[21:12:10] <scar> $('.submit-updated').show().delay(3000).hide(); didnt work
[21:12:10] <bubu> and on the last line (which is return false)
[21:13:39] <shoky> scar: try .show(0)  .hide(0)  for a simple fi
[21:13:40] <shoky> fix
[21:14:08] <kibab> bubu: if it's fireing twice, you can take a look at the stacktrace when you hit the breakpoint each time. It will differ and one of the elements of the stacktrace may show why.
[21:14:17] <Lurzino> BillCriswell no wait... I populated first select , I mean the #selectproducts , then I selected the product and since #selectcategories is populated depending from product's selection... in fact there's already a change() event for each selects but if I set option by code normally the change() event doesn't fire since it doesn't refresh the control I guess
[21:15:38] <Lurzino> In fact I tried before also doing $("#selectproducts").val(data.Ref_products_ID.toString()).attr('selected', 'selected').change(); but change() event didn't fired anyway and I see the #selectcategories 's select still empty
[21:15:55] <kibab> I'm trying to change a text area in response to a form submit. It works the first time, but doesn't subsequent times. Any idea why: http://jsfiddle.net/btNaf/ ?
[21:16:48] <bubu> kibab: it's the same HTMLFormElement object
[21:16:55] <shoky> kibab: use .val(...)  not .text(...)
[21:17:37] <scar> How can I grab all the form vars used in the <form></form> element when using ajax?
[21:17:38] <bubu> kibab: or you mean look at the jquery code?
[21:18:22] <kibab> shoky: You're right... but I don't understand why that makes a difference. I mean, it worked the first time?
[21:18:34] <kibab> shoky: I don't have any closures?
[21:19:57] <kibab> bubu: no, I'm talking about the stack trace. If the stack trace is different than you might find that it's bound through two different paths. If not, perhaps it's really bound more than once.
[21:20:42] <Lurzino> at least a possible alternative to bind('change', ...); to force executing population of next select?
[21:21:06] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: I'm not sure I'm following right. If you're trying to trigger a change event try $('select').trigger('change')
[21:21:13] <gnarf> Lurzino: "change" is fired on the select
[21:21:16] <gnarf> not the option
[21:21:35] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Yeah, this is where I can't follow usually haha
[21:21:50] <Lurzino> gnarf yes yes... #selectproducts is a select in fact
[21:21:59] <gnarf> .val("1") should set the value to whatever option has the value="1"
[21:22:09] <gnarf> wtf is attr("selected","selected") for
[21:22:47] <kibab> gnarf: to set the selected option (in older versions of jquery
[21:22:54] <Lurzino> yes yes gnarf in fact that $("#selectproducts").val(data.Ref_products_ID.toString()) sets the value to the option that has that value correctly
[21:23:13] <Lurzino> is just the fact since I am selecting by code the option it doesn't fire the change event
[21:23:17] <gnarf> kibab: wrong
[21:23:29] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: $('select').trigger('change')
[21:23:42] <gnarf> Lurzino: .trigger("change")
[21:23:59] <gnarf> Lurzino: will only trigger events bound by jquery
[21:24:13] <Lurzino> BillCriswell... I tried $("#selectproducts").val(data.Ref_products_ID.toString()).attr('selected', 'selected').change(); which should be similar to .trigger("change") but it didn't fire the change event
[21:24:22] <gnarf> Lurzino: drop that .attr()
[21:24:33] <Lurzino> ok gnarf
[21:24:34] <gnarf> Lurzino: its completely useless
[21:24:52] <gnarf> Lurzino: .change() does indeed trigger change events bound with jQuery
[21:24:55] <gnarf> so at this point
[21:24:55] <gnarf> ?p
[21:24:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:25:00] <gnarf> ?demo
[21:25:00] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:25:52] <Lurzino> gnarf I would do a jsfiddle but the population is done by database queries...
[21:26:43] <Lurzino> in fact inside change() events I have $.ajax() where I call .php to load options from db
[21:28:18] <gnarf> Lurzino: hard to help then...
[21:28:30] <gnarf> can't you mock this data?
[21:28:45] <gnarf> and/or make a "quick" example that uses very little code
[21:28:49] <gnarf> showing what your doing
[21:28:54] <gnarf> using some static data
[21:28:59] <gnarf> and show it not working?
[21:29:25] <Lurzino> you mean like static data... ok I'll try to do a jsfiddle test
[21:29:33] <Lurzino> gimme some minutes to implement it
[21:29:41] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: http://jsfiddle.net/NBkEg/ is this kind of like what you're trying to accomplish?
[21:31:19] <Lurzino> BillCriswell yes sort of
[21:31:57] <Lurzino> just in that exameple the change event is fired when I select the option by hand
[21:32:09] <Lurzino> but in my issue I select the option by code
[21:32:22] <Lurzino> and so it doesn't trigger the change
[21:32:31] <bubu> im using the jquery-ui tabs, and i'm loading them via AJAX. problem is, each time a tab is clicked, the document.ready() function is called
[21:35:36] <kibab> shoky: So I found out why .text() doesn't work more than the first time on the textarea. There's one line in the docs that says, "The .text() method cannot be used on input elements. For input field text, use the .val() method."
[21:35:38] <BillCriswell> Lurzino: http://jsfiddle.net/NBkEg/ Like this?
[21:36:05] <kibab> I guess I shouldn't have assumed it worked with any element that had textual content....
[21:36:48] <BillCriswell> kibab: Form elements can be dicks sometimes.
[21:36:50] <gnarf> kibab: the "value" wins with a textarea
[21:36:54] <Lurzino> yes BillCriswell but in my issue I select the option by code...
[21:37:04] <gnarf> kibab: it doesn't actually have any text content :)
[21:37:08] <gnarf> it has a value
[21:38:25] <gnarf> Lurzino: http://jsfiddle.net/NBkEg/3/
[21:39:00] <kibab> gnarf: so even though you type the context of a textarea as text content... and no value attribute is displayed, there's an underlying value somewhere?
[21:39:04] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Ahhhh.
[21:39:26] <Lurzino> gnarf weird ... in your example the change() fires but in my issue it doesn't fire... that's weird
[21:39:27] <BillCriswell> kibab: Yes. Form elements are strange beasts.
[21:39:43] <gnarf> Lurzino: thats why i'm saying - it definitely works
[21:39:45] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/NBkEg/4/
[21:39:46] <gnarf> :)
[21:40:10] <kibab> BillCriswell, k. After spending the last 2.5 hours on something that should have been fairly simple, I'll definitely remember that :)
[21:40:15] <gnarf> kibab: yup, like the dom element doesn't have any children
[21:40:19] <heiths> .course-info is a class on a few div tags... I want to change the "content" attribute of my css to match the text in the div's label
[21:40:23] <gnarf> kibab: it just populates the value property in the DOM
[21:41:03] <BillCriswell> kibab: Use val() whenever you can.
[21:41:18] <BillCriswell> Like... even if you're setting a select option to something, use val().
[21:42:10] <kibab> gnarf + BillCriswell : I'm still too new to the web world to have known that.
[21:43:03] <bubu> is it better to just use the "on" function vs. "click", "submit", etc.?
[21:44:49] <kibab> Anybody know any good books that talk about HTML + JS-based app design? I have a couple good JS lang books and HTML/CSS books, but I'd like something that talks more about best practices... progressive javascript, history, model/view separation, etc.?
[21:45:03] <Lurzino> hmmm gnarf and BillCriswell , I have in fact normal change events $("#selectproducts").change(function(){ $.ajax({ .... }); }); .... shall I have maybe better change with on('change', function(e) { ... }); ?
[21:45:24] <kibab> bubu: depending on the version of on that you use, it could be the same.
[21:46:08] <BillCriswell> kibab: http://jsfiddle.net/UWgR3/ Is nice to mess around with. I never thought to use val() to change a selects selected value with those when I first started with jQuery.
[21:47:24] <heiths> Ok, I have a fiddle.  http://jsfiddle.net/UkwZY/11/
[21:47:39] <gnarf> Lurzino: its an alias
[21:47:47] <kibab> bubu: In $('root').on('click', 'selector', ...) you're only binding to those elements matched by $('root') and the other nodes need not exist at the time you bind.
[21:48:42] <BillCriswell> heiths: What label?
[21:49:00] <BillCriswell> Oh you mean child.
[21:49:05] <heiths> ah, sorry... I didn't include that in the fiddle...
[21:50:10] <bubu> kibab: i'm talking about doing $("#form").submit(function(...  vs.  $("#form").on("submit", function(...
[21:50:23] <BillCriswell> heiths: You want want something that's a parent of the element you're working with use .closest('label')
[21:50:35] <BillCriswell> If you want the child use .find('label')
[21:50:39] <heiths> I'm not sure how to articulate what I'm trying to do... I'm new to the front-end stuff... I basically want to dynamically change the data-content value based on something...
[21:51:01] <heiths> closest('label'), I'll read up on that, thanks!
[21:51:07] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[21:51:08] <Lurzino> I'll investigate later about this .change() on my issue since now I need to take shower before to go office :)
[21:51:40] <kibab> bubu: IIRC, those two are identical. It's only when you have the selector in the on that they become different.
[21:53:18] <bubu> kibab: i'm trying to avoid the submit bind being called mulitple times
[21:53:34] <BillCriswell> bubu: Have example code?
[21:54:05] <bubu> BillCriswell: I gave some :)
[21:54:56] <BillCriswell> bubu: Ah think I missed it
[21:55:40] <gnarf> ?one @bubu
[21:55:46] <gnarf> damnit bot-t
[21:55:55] <gnarf> bubu: http://api.jquery.com/one
[21:56:09] <bubu> basically with the jquery-ui tabs, everytime a tab is switched, the tab's document.ready gets called
[21:56:22] <gnarf> bubu: oh
[21:56:24] <BillCriswell> bubu: Really? That's no fun.
[21:56:42] <gnarf> bubu: thats not really true, but if you are loading a document that includes another document ready, it is
[21:57:07] <bubu> gnarf: well yes, that's the case
[21:57:27] <bubu> gnarf: each tab i has has it's own document.ready
[21:57:32] <bubu> i have*
[21:57:49] <BillCriswell> bubu: That's intense. What's the reason?
[21:58:07] <bubu> each tab has complex functionality
[21:58:22] <bubu> its not just simple text
[22:00:17] <BillCriswell> bubu: I still don't think I understand why document ready would need to be called on each tab. Probably just missing something big though haha
[22:00:28] <BillCriswell> I want to go to bed but my damn cat is sleeping in my spot.
[22:01:21] <bubu> because im registering dialogs, handlers, and what not on each tab
[22:01:34] <bubu> haha move the cat?
[22:01:49] <BillCriswell> He looks too comfy.
[22:02:36] <bubu> i think i need a drink
[22:03:04] <BillCriswell> Don't we all.
[22:03:38] <bubu> the joys of working from home :)
[22:05:38] <GoSox> Can I select elements using custom attributes? Like if I have a bunch of list items, with unique data-id attributes ? And I want to add a class to the list item where data-id = 34
[22:05:48] <heiths> could you guys take one more quick look and tell me if I'm heading in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/UkwZY/13/
[22:06:18] <BillCriswell> GoSox: Yes.
[22:06:21] <coldhead> $('[data-id="34"]')
[22:06:45] <GoSox> nice thats easy
[22:06:46] <BillCriswell> $('[data-id="34"]').addClass('awesome')
[22:07:20] <GoSox> is that well supported?
[22:07:26] <BillCriswell> heiths: I think you want the child label.
[22:07:42] <heiths> ok, the find('label')
[22:07:59] <coldhead> 100% supported, GoSox
[22:08:03] <GoSox> nice
[22:08:06] <BillCriswell> heiths: http://jsfiddle.net/UkwZY/14/
[22:08:54] <rgenito> i think of a violin when i read "jsfiddle"
[22:09:15] <coldhead> i think of child molesters :(
[22:09:41] <heiths> wow... very cool.  thanks!
[22:10:06] <BillCriswell> heiths: No problem!
[22:10:32] <BillCriswell> I wish my cat was ugly or a dick or something so I didn't feel bad waking him up.
[22:13:31] <coldhead> cats love going back to sleep
[22:14:01] <BillCriswell> He's currently taking up 30% of the bed, girlfriend is taking up her usual 70%...
[22:14:15] <bubu> he probably hasnt done shit all day
[22:14:30] <BillCriswell> No idea how someone 5'3 and 110 can take up as much space as her but she manages.
[22:14:49] <GoSox> you say girlfriend, but all this talk of cats makes me think maybe you mean boyfriend
[22:14:51] <BillCriswell> bubu: He is lazy as shit.
[22:15:07] <bubu> is this possible? document.one("ready", function(....
[22:15:09] <rgenito> lol GoSox
[22:15:12] <BillCriswell> GoSox: Not the firstperson to say that.
[22:15:39] <GoSox> nor the last, most likely
[22:15:43] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[22:18:56] <scar> im using ajax to generate html for a div, and in that html there's a button that has an ID on it that I need to access with ajax already loaded-- is there a way to do this, maybe reload the code?
[22:19:03] <gnarf> bubu: document ready only fires once
[22:19:07] <gnarf> and no, that doesn't work
[22:19:26] <bubu> youre right, it doesnt. i just tried
[22:19:39] <heiths> my final question(tonight):  Do I need to loop through these to make each one unique?   http://jsfiddle.net/UkwZY/15/
[22:20:18] <bubu> scar: look at the on() function
[22:20:55] <muffinrecon> hey guys, anyone know of a image gallery plugin that doesn't allow the user to go to the previous image?
[22:21:15] <gnarf> heiths: http://jsfiddle.net/UkwZY/16/
[22:21:31] <scar> bubu: what do you mean?
[22:22:40] <heiths> very nice solution!  thanks gnarf!
[22:23:16] <coldhead> that chick is a genius
[22:23:30] <bubu> scar: im not sure what you meant by "access it with ajax already loaded"
[22:23:52] <BillCriswell> scar: Do you mean you're dynamically generating a button you want to add a click event to?
[22:26:08] <scar> BillCriswell: yes a button is being generated with ajax using .html() and that buttons selector WAS working when it was genereated wthout ajax-- now it wont... so im guessing i need to reset something?
[22:26:11] <kibab> Thanks for the help all. Have a good night.
[22:27:09] <BillCriswell> scar: http://jsfiddle.net/Eysyq/ might help you understand .on() a bit better.
[22:27:43] <BillCriswell> You probably don't want to use body really but a common parent.
[22:27:55] <bubu> on() is amazing
[22:28:11] <coldhead> OH THIS COMET WAS THE ONLY MAN I LOVED
[22:28:30] <BillCriswell> comet?
[22:29:08] <scar> BillCriswell: however, if im using this in the success: portion of the ajax call, do i need to not even place it there? and use .on() instead of .click() ?
[22:29:08] <tw2113> coldhead is off his meds again
[22:29:21] <scar> or do i need to use .on with .html
[22:29:32] <bubu> scar: you need .on in your document.ready()
[22:30:11] <scar> yes i get that
[22:30:29] <BillCriswell> scar: You could still use click() but you'll need to work with the event object.
[22:30:43] <scar> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/76vuLWwQ
[22:31:01] <scar> BillCriswell: thats what i have, see the .html() on the #ulg_cat_settings ?
[22:31:22] <BillCriswell> scar: yes.
[22:31:46] <scar> i am confused, am i to wrap the click with on instead? let me try lol
[22:31:55] <tw2113> pastebin needs more coloring contrast
[22:32:14] <gnarf> pastebin needs less advertisements
[22:32:38] <BillCriswell> gnarf: You mean you don't love that popup?!
[22:32:48] <BillCriswell> When you mouseover the nissan ad.
[22:33:29] <scar> BillCriswell: here's what i tried for the click with no luck http://pastebin.com/v7v11UyF
[22:34:46] <BillCriswell> scar: Are you actually trying to select a button element?
[22:34:55] <scar2> BillCriswell: here's what i tried for the click with no luck http://pastebin.com/v7v11UyF
[22:34:56] <scar2> yes
[22:35:07] <scar2> can i select it by an id or do i have to use button?
[22:35:24] <BillCriswell> You can use any jquery selector I bbelieve.
[22:35:58] <BillCriswell> Sorry can't keep my eyes open. Headed to bed. Night all!
[22:37:42] <scar2> i tried $("#cat-submit").on("click", function(event){
[22:37:43] <scar2> blah
[22:37:45] <scar2> nothing
[22:38:39] <bubu> where did you put that?
[22:40:45] <scar> i suppose they are resetting my internet
[22:40:46] <scar> bubu: i used .live() instead and it works :)
[22:43:11] <gnarf> scar: .live() is deprecated
[22:43:31] <gnarf> scar: see http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:48:33] <scar> gnarf how come $("#cat-submit").live("click", function(event){} works but not $("#cat-submit").on("click", function(event){} ?
[22:48:53] <gnarf> scar: $(document)".on("click", "#cat-submit"), function(event){}
[22:49:03] <gnarf> minus the extra )
[22:49:11] <gnarf> scar: $(document)".on("click", "#cat-submit", function(event){ ... })
[22:49:20] <gnarf> scar: read the api docs
[22:49:24] <gnarf> it explains this pretty well
[22:49:32] <gnarf> the docs for live that is
[22:49:41] <gnarf> way better than i could explain it in IRC
[22:50:02] <gnarf> if you have questions about something the docs say about it, ask
[22:50:41] <scar> live docs explain how to use on?
[22:51:18] <tw2113> i think he meant .live() ?
[22:51:40] <GoSox> YOu ever wonder how much code you'd get, if you copied everything on all of your projects, and pasted it into one long document, and printed it at 9 point monospace font
[22:52:02] <tw2113> why do you think my sleep schedule sucks GoSox ?
[22:52:20] <GoSox> i don't think you're going to get any sleep schedule sympathy anywhere on IRC
[22:55:20] <GoSox> is there a way to manually edit the values of cookies, using firebug or something?
[22:55:58] <bubu> sleep is an investment
[23:00:56] <gnarf> scar: yes, they do, because they talk about it being deprecated
[23:01:22] <gnarf> scar: they point you to the replacement you should use
[23:01:27] <gnarf> and tell you why .live() sucks
[23:03:06] <bubu> it should be relatively interchangeable
[23:03:17] <bubu> i.e. replace "live" with "on"
[23:03:22] <gnarf> bubu: false
[23:03:56] <gnarf> $( selector ).live( event, handle ) === $( document ).on( event, selector, handle )
[23:04:06] <bubu> the 2nd selector is optional
[23:04:30] <bubu> so you could do: $("#button").on("click", function)
[23:04:40] <gnarf> bubu: true, but the behavior of binding to document, with the selector is what live does
[23:04:59] <gnarf> bubu: that will bind a click event to #button (if it exists in the document when you run it)
[23:05:01] <gnarf> whereas
[23:05:33] <gnarf> $(document).on("click", "#button", function) would be what live does
[23:05:40] <bubu> gotcha
[23:05:52] <gnarf> bind an event on the "document" that whenever a click happens, if #button is the thing being clicked, run the function
[23:06:05] <scar> gnarf: whats the handle? i have this $("#cat-submit").live("click", function(event){}
[23:06:40] <AdamPDotty> who submits cats here?
[23:06:47] <gnarf> scar: $(document).on("click","#cat-submit",function(event){}); -- see same message 20 minutes ago
[23:06:58] <scar> got d/c multiple times
[23:06:59] <scar> sry
[23:07:30] <gnarf> scar: http://api.jquery.com/live --- read the section on what it did and why its not right
[23:08:35] <scar> ok
[23:09:24] <GoSox> does javascipt use pcre syntax for its regexps?
[23:09:33] <GoSox> like with the test() method
[23:09:42] <gnarf> GoSox: no, but close enough
[23:09:52] <GoSox> mmmmok
[23:09:52] <gnarf> GoSox: notably, no lookbehinds
[23:10:04] <GoSox> ok im not doing anything all that fancy
[23:11:42] <gnarf> GoSox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[23:15:44] <GoSox> back to selecting with a custom attribute, if i wanted to match an attribute data-id, but only within container #state_col, is this the proper syntax?
[23:15:58] <GoSox> $('#state_col [data-id="5"]')
[23:16:57] <gnarf> GoSox: yes, but just to warn you thats really slow
[23:17:14] <gnarf> you could gain a little perf back by having a common class then the attribute selector
[23:17:35] <gnarf> like $('#state_col .hasId[data-id="5"]')
[23:17:43] <bubu> scar: try "body" and not document
[23:18:04] <GoSox> is the slowness going to make that much of a difference? 50 states means 50 list items
[23:18:06] <bubu> scar: or something more specific, like a div
[23:18:26] <gnarf> GoSox: $("#state_col *") only matches 50?
[23:18:41] <GoSox> with a > yes
[23:18:46] <gnarf> its just the "implicit *" on the attrib selector then
[23:18:50] <GoSox> less actually because i don't have every state in my database yet
[23:18:53] <gnarf> expensive
[23:19:01] <GoSox> what about elements instead of classes?
[23:19:07] <gnarf> tagname too
[23:19:08] <gnarf> yeah
[23:19:11] <GoSox> every element i'm matchin is an LI
[23:19:14] <gnarf> if thats a good filter
[23:19:15] <gnarf> yup
[23:19:19] <gnarf> li[data-id]
[23:19:20] <GoSox> $('#state_col li[data-id="'+$state+'"]')
[23:19:41] <gnarf> sure
[23:20:13] <GoSox> actually they're a's inside the li's but thats going to solve the slowness issue?
[23:20:38] <gnarf> GoSox: every element you look at is gonna cost you something
[23:20:47] <GoSox> it feels the same speed to me, but its probably always going to be fast on a fast computer
[23:20:53] <gnarf> GoSox: true
[23:21:13] <gnarf> GoSox: its just one of those "you're making your css processor work harder than it needs to" situations
[23:26:31] <rgenito> holy hell i found my first php bug!!! @_@
[23:26:45] <rgenito> ...too bad it's probably already resolved lol. this is php 5.2.16 we're talkin about
[23:26:55] <rgenito> ANNNNDDD...i meant to send this message to #php :)
[23:32:30] <Hilton> Question: Will .click() replace a previous .click() function, or be added so both run?
[23:35:45] <scar> how can i tell if im having a conflict? http://ulg.alomedia.net/product/ooh-la-la-lingerie-invitation/
[23:35:52] <scar> nivo seems to be acting funny and page is off
[23:36:08] <GoSox> gnarf: so that selector is working in one instance, and in the same document, not working in another
[23:36:14] <GoSox> and i bet i know why
[23:36:32] <GoSox> when the page initially loads, this column of data isn't there yet
[23:38:17] <GoSox> is there something special you have to do to get selectors to see items that were added recently, by other javascript?
[23:39:01] <scar> nvm its late found ith aha
[23:39:13] <gnarf> GoSox: wait until they are there before you look for them? :)
[23:39:55] <GoSox> hmm
[23:41:50] <GoSox> yep that worked
[23:42:09] <GoSox> knowing exactly when things are happening can be confusing with this client side stuff
