[00:22:24] <mzilla> in the stop event of UI.draggable is it possible to detect if a drop was succesfull?
[00:24:19] <oojacoboo> mzilla: maybe you want a droppable event for that?
[00:24:46] <oojacoboo> mzilla: but by default, the stop event would be a "drop", no?
[00:26:54] <mzilla> oojacoboo: you might be right, what I am trying to do is that when dragging starts the element that is being dragged gets replaced by a placeholder and when dragging stops if the dragging failed and no acceptable dropable was found I want to replace the placeholder with the original element
[00:27:06] <mzilla> but you are right, I should be using dropable events for that!
[00:28:09] <oojacoboo> mzilla: you want revert then
[00:28:16] <oojacoboo> check the options
[00:28:29] <mzilla> will do, thanks I am confusnig myself here :)
[00:29:36] <mzilla> what I really want to make is a sortable placeholder like thing
[00:30:12] <mzilla> but I need todo more complex things then sortable can do so I need to implement it myself using draggable / droppable
[00:30:29] <oojacoboo> have fun :)
[00:30:38] <oojacoboo> I was playing around with draggable yesterday
[00:37:01] <Roots47> How do you guys organize your jquery when it starts getting to the 500+ line mark in a single document?
[00:37:03] <mzilla> thanks, always a challenge :)
[00:37:59] <mzilla> Roots47: Same question here to. I think creating subfiles is a reasonable strategy. Group the code by functionality and create seperate files.
[00:38:25] <fullsailor> Roots47: There's no universal right answer unfortunately.
[00:39:03] <Roots47> fullsailor: did you go to full sail university?
[00:39:12] <fullsailor> I did.
[00:39:33] <Roots47> fullsailor: nice, one of my friends just got home from full sail.  He's doing recording
[00:39:35] <fullsailor> Web Design & Development 2008-2010
[00:40:43] <Roots47> Nice, how was their web development program?
[00:41:48] <fullsailor> Fantastic. Great group of instructors.
[00:44:07] <ilteris> where do you guys write your jquery files?
[00:44:17] <Roots47> Thats the most important part
[00:44:25] <similian1> on my computer
[00:44:32] <Roots47> in my room
[00:44:43] <ilteris> heh I mean what IDE? I am struggling to find a good workflow
[00:44:59] <fullsailor> No IDE, just Vim
[00:45:02] <ilteris> I would appreicate any directions
[00:45:04] <Roots47> Ahhhh ... sorry bout' that :D   I use PhpED
[00:45:06] <mindis|wurk> i use phped
[00:45:12] <similian1> IntelliJ
[00:45:32] <similian1> (basically jquery should not be the reason for chosing diff. IDE)
[00:45:42] <ilteris> fullsailor vim? nice. what config files do you use to format your code?
[00:45:47] <similian1> it should be your main/backend language
[00:46:00] <Roots47> ^ agree
[00:46:01] <similian1> if your just frontend I guess it doesnt matter :)
[00:46:02] <fullsailor> http://github.com/fullsailor/dotfiles
[00:46:49] <ilteris> fullsailor lolvely! thanks a lot.
[00:47:10] <ilteris> and everyone else thank you too :)
[00:52:08] <mzilla> PhpED here to btw
[00:52:19] <mzilla> when I am at home on my Mac it's Textmate
[00:54:03] <Ortund> seeing as I'd like to get an iPhone, I guess I shouldn't cringe like I just did when I see people still use mac...
[00:56:02] <ryannathans> on registration @ https://wegift.org/  the jquery seems to be submitting the page twice, as a result causing the error "Someone has already entered with this IP addresss."  where might my code be doing this?
[00:57:46] <fullsailor> ryannathans: Does the click event fire twice?
[00:58:37] <ryannathans> fullsailor: the POST is submitted twice
[00:59:58] <Ortund> ryannathans its POSTs to itself?
[01:01:46] <Ortund> ryannathans: send it a "counter" and have it ignore the post if the value for the counter variable is a certain value
[01:02:37] <Ortund> so if (counter === 1) { // ignore post and load user page whose details have been saved } else { // process registration };
[01:02:44] <Ortund> probably an ugly fix though
[01:03:43] <ryannathans> yes, I want to find out why/how it's being POSTed twice
[01:03:55] <blackspotwiggins> ryannathans, using ajax?
[01:03:59] <ryannathans> yes
[01:04:10] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you are not canceling the native submit event
[01:04:14] <ryannathans> https://wegift.org -- the registration page POSTs twice
[01:04:38] <ryannathans> e.preventDefault(); should be enough to stop the button[type="submit"] submitting the form right?
[01:04:52] <blackspotwiggins> ryannathans, use the submit handler on the form
[01:05:02] <blackspotwiggins> you can submit with pressing enter as well
[01:05:13] <ryannathans> you can submit with enter at the moment?
[01:06:17] <ryannathans> how do I submit the form with ajax?
[01:06:37] <blackspotwiggins> don't use ajax if you don't understand it
[01:06:42] <blackspotwiggins> it is actually that simple
[01:08:31] <Qbix1> hey guys
[01:08:35] <Qbix1> if I want to discuss jquery tools, where do I ask?
[01:11:43] <ryannathans> fixed it!
[01:11:53] <ryannathans> replaced the input type="submit" with button type="submit"
[01:13:10] <datadl> Hi people! I have maybe a problem in a function I am developing: I bind ENTER, ESC & TAB keys with the keypress, keydown, keyup events on a text input. The end of my function makes a "blur" and run a callback. I am trying to also bind the "click" event so it does the same as ENTER. But it never works well, I cannot figure a way to know that my input has changed without using the event "change".
[01:23:44] <ryannathans> it's still doing it
[01:23:44] <ryannathans> wtf
[01:24:13] <ryannathans> and it's not
[01:26:36] <ryannathans> on first page load, pushing submit sends the POST only ONCE, after an ajex refresh, eg: failed to enter something properly, it submits POST TWICE each time
[01:27:02] <gianiaz> ryannathans, how do you manage your form?
[01:27:44] <gianiaz> have you seen the ajaxform plugin by mike alsup? I think is the best choice for submitting form via ajax, and you don't have to worry how the form is managed
[01:32:28] <StevenCodes22> cool examples anyone can be anything just bored
[01:33:06] <_science> ryannathans: remeber to return false from your click event function
[01:33:13] <_science> otherwise the form will submit "normally"
[01:33:25] <ryannathans> thanks
[01:34:04] <ryannathans> _science: still same problem
[01:34:15] <ryannathans> _science: have you seen the code?
[01:34:51] <_science> ryannathans: nope just picked up on that form was submitted twice.
[01:34:52] <_science> :)
[01:35:08] <ryannathans> https://wegift.org/ajaxregister.php  -- the script is in there
[01:35:10] <Zappy> $('form').submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); ? //DO STUFF: send and receive data ? });
[01:35:25] <ryannathans> go to https://wegift.org and the register form submits twice after the first submit
[01:35:31] <ryannathans> on the second attempt
[01:35:33] <ryannathans> if you fail
[01:37:18] <ryannathans> Zappy: eh?
[01:37:34] <ryannathans> Zappy: oooh
[01:37:34] <beasty> mm
[01:37:35] <ryannathans> form submit
[01:37:41] <ryannathans> i was using button.click
[01:37:42] <beasty> i'm trying to do this $('div',_tpl).removeClass('entry close').addClass('entry open');
[01:37:49] <beasty> but for some reason it's not working
[01:37:51] <beasty> any ideas ?
[01:37:53] <Zappy> ryannathans ? stop it from submitting normally, before doing any AJAX :)
[01:38:52] <ryannathans> Zappy: i was preventDefault() on the button
[01:38:53] <ryannathans> not the form
[01:38:54] <ryannathans> derp
[01:39:04] <pashmi56> hi there, i have a div, the height is set to 30px in css with overfloe hidden, how can i get the actuall size of the without doing .css('height', 'auto') ?
[01:39:15] <Zappy> The form needs it? as it's default is to submit
[01:39:26] <Ortund> hahaha ryannathans I spotted that, but never used preventDefault() so didn't pick up that it was a problem
[01:39:37] <ryannathans> Zappy: it's still happening
[01:40:59] <ryannathans> Ortund: turns out it wasn't the culprit
[01:41:07] <Ortund> ouch
[01:41:11] <ryannathans> still submitting twice, but not on first attempt
[01:41:58] <Ortund> maybe have it do a check for an existing account before submitting new data?
[01:42:19] <ryannathans> eh?
[01:42:26] <ryannathans> it'll still submit form twice
[01:42:32] <muzone> How do I turn this snippet from CoffeeScript into regular JavaScript? https://gist.github.com/1646458
[01:43:05] <datadl> ryannathans: instead of using the preventDefault, you should add a return false at the end of your function
[01:44:33] <ryannathans> still happening
[01:45:21] <ryannathans> i dont think the form is every being submit
[01:45:27] <ryannathans> i think the ajax is somehow firing twice
[01:45:33] <datadl> addNewCollection.submit(function(){
[01:45:33] <datadl>         $.post(domain+'/collection/create', addNewCollection.serialize());
[01:45:33] <datadl>     }
[01:45:33] <datadl> });
[01:45:49] <ryannathans> because commenting the ajax out, I can't get the form to submit at all.
[01:45:51] <datadl> works like a charm..
[01:46:01] <datadl> maybe you call your function twice?
[01:46:08] <datadl> add a console.log or an alert
[01:46:15] <datadl> to see what's going on
[01:46:22] <pashmi56> hi there, i have a div, the height is set to 30px in css with overfloe hidden, how can i get the actuall size of the without doing .css('height', 'auto') ?
[01:47:21] <datadl> pashmi56: put your inside content into another div
[01:47:27] <datadl> and do a .height on that div
[01:47:37] <datadl> should work
[01:47:47] <ryannathans> yup, ajax is being called twice
[01:48:05] <ryannathans> I don't know why though, it's not being called on the first one twice
[01:48:34] <datadl> do you use a .live to do your function?
[01:48:53] <ryannathans> no
[01:48:59] <pashmi56> datadl: thank for the reply, i am not sure if it will work for me.  I want to hide and show part of the text paragraph
[01:49:21] <ryannathans> 		jQuery.ajax('/ajaxregister.php', {type:'POST', data:{'submit':smt, 'email':email, 'name':nme, 'password':pwd, 'password2':pwd2}, success:function(data, textStatus, jqXHR){
[01:49:24] <ryannathans> 			console.log('ajax spray and wipe');
[01:49:27] <ryannathans> 			$('article').hide(function() {
[01:49:29] <ryannathans> 				$(this).html(data);
[01:49:32] <ryannathans> 			});
[01:49:34] <ryannathans> }});
[01:51:29] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn Image
[01:51:30] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[01:51:40] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc Image
[01:51:41] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, image - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/image
[01:52:01] <ryannathans> someone tell me if they fix it, I need a break.
[01:52:22] <aaronmcadam> you'll need to call show on that
[01:52:31] <aaronmcadam> $(this).html(data).show()
[01:54:52] <silv3r_m00n> is this correct to handle NaNs var tds_rate = parseFloat( $(this).val() ) || 0.0;  ?
[01:55:05] <silv3r_m00n> I see that it works
[01:56:01] <progzer> Excuse me, I've just realized that in IE9 TR's innerHTML is a readonly property.
[01:56:23] <progzer> Does jQuery's .html handle this?
[01:57:10] <fullsailor> progzer: My gut response is yes, it will.
[01:57:33] <fullsailor> I'd be surprised if their test suite missed it.
[01:58:08] <mindis|wurk> well, jquery is full of IE surprises ;)
[01:58:14] <mindis|wurk> can't really blame them though
[01:58:43] <progzer> Seems to work, thank you.
[01:59:15] <progzer> The work around was ugly. create another element, with child elements and replace the tr's parent node's child with it.
[01:59:42] <mindis|wurk> it might be doing that in the background anyway
[02:00:56] <progzer> Yeah, I'd imagine that's what jQuery is doing in the background.
[02:09:11] <donCams> Eviltwin, thanks for that javascript link. still not finished yet but I've got a feeling i will be better
[02:12:32] <Dulak> how would you select table rows by contents?
[02:13:09] <anli_> Dulak: Can you use classes instead?
[02:13:25] <Dulak> on table rows?
[02:13:28] <anli_> yes
[02:13:37] <anli_> <tr class='foo'>
[02:13:39] <Dulak> good idea, thanks
[02:13:49] <anli_> :)
[02:13:54] <Dulak> didn't think tr and td could have classes....
[02:13:56] <Dulak> doh
[02:13:58] <anli_> ah
[02:14:01] <nail__> and there's :contains() if there's no other option
[02:14:03] <StevenCodes22> lmao
[02:14:49] <anli_> I have a problem, for each div with a certain class, I want to run a function that calls an ajax call, how do I do this sequentially without building up a big stack?
[02:14:53] <anli_> (call stack)
[02:15:29] <anli_> I will use function calc(continuation), where continuation is a callback function
[02:16:05] <anli_> Is maybe js guaranteed to not build up a big stack if a function is called at the end of a function?
[02:22:50] <sviatovigt> hi
[02:23:08] <sviatovigt> I have an element that I remove from the page using detach
[02:23:42] <sviatovigt> when I try to restore that element using this line $("#block-control-section").html("#block-personal-section");
[02:24:01] <sviatovigt> I only get this text: #block-personal-section
[02:24:22] <sviatovigt> how can I restore the removed div instead of just printing the text
[02:29:34] <nail__> anli_: re-call your function recursively in your callback, like: http://jsfiddle.net/jzzyD/
[02:30:44] <anli_> I can do that, but isnt the number of stack limits very limited?
[02:31:00] <anli_> Does it make a difference if I do the recursive call at the end?
[02:31:08] <nail__> anli_: it's done in the callback, so it's not a real recursivity
[02:31:46] <nail__> so it will be called again only when the ajax call returns, the previous call to boing() will already have returned by that time
[02:31:51] <FinalAngel> is there an event handler for if the width of a select field changes?
[02:31:52] <nail__> so it's not "stacking up"
[02:31:57] <anli_> Oh, this is alternating recursivity
[02:32:03] <anli_> So its filling up the stack
[02:32:10] <anli_> Unless js cant do something clever
[02:32:32] <anli_> Hm, wait, you are right
[02:33:08] <anli_> I did a mistake in thinking there
[02:33:23] <phretor> hello: I am looking for a "kit" that helps me at creating an interface for letting user specify complex AND/OR filters. I don't know how to describe this better :)
[02:35:18] <Zappy> phretor: Like an advanced search-function?
[02:36:07] <nail__> sviatovigt: if you detach() it you'll need to save it somewhere, like $foo = $('#block-personal-section'), then later on, $('#block-control-section').html($foo.html())
[02:36:08] <phretor> Zappy: something like that - there are some predefined tokens and the user will be able to compose filters by dragging and dropping them along with and/or tags
[02:36:34] <sviatovigt> thank you nail__
[02:36:52] <nail__> sviatovigt: $foo = $('#block-personal-section').detach() even :)
[02:37:09] <sviatovigt> but as I seen in the examples on jquery.com and on some other sites
[02:37:20] <sviatovigt> they do not save the content in a variable
[02:37:24] <bonhoffer> i have a checkbox that toggles a div, how can i make the div class="required" when it shows?
[02:37:28] <sviatovigt> but I will try this way
[02:37:39] <Zappy> phretor: Ok ? sounds like a UI-question ?
[02:38:09] <bonhoffer> i think i need to have this.val == "checked" ? this.addClass("required") : this.removeClass("required")
[02:38:09] <phretor> Zappy: that is. Do you have any sort of pointers/keyword so that I can dig deeper on this subject?
[02:38:09] <nail__> sviatovigt: well once you $('#foo').detach(), subsequent calls to $('#foo') won't return anything as it's removed from the dom
[02:38:34] <bonhoffer> but i think i can use toggleClass("required") inside somehow
[02:39:23] <Zappy> phretor: Not really ? not my force ? but try: http://jqueryui.com/
[02:40:32] <siovene> Hi.
[02:40:50] <siovene> Is there a way to animate the change of size of a div, when I'm programmatically adding content to it?
[02:41:37] <siovene> if (some_condition) $something.appendTo($my_div); <--- $my_div will become bigger, and I'd like to animate that.
[02:45:13] <VictorCL_2> hi , is there a good plugin to detect if the user is using a mobile , tablet or other device wit has touchscreen?
[02:48:48] <eshlox> hi, http://pastebin.com/eQaEgyke can i change variable inside this uploader?
[02:49:03] <Cork> VictorCL_2: var $.support.touch_event = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement);
[02:49:20] <VictorCL_2> I found this
[02:49:20] <VictorCL_2> navigator.userAgent.match(/(iPhone|iPod|iPad|Android|BlackBerry)/);
[02:49:22] <Cork> opps -var
[02:49:38] <Cork> VictorCL_2: don't do user agent sniffing if you don't need to
[02:50:24] <VictorCL_2> I didnt understood your example Cork
[02:50:35] <progzer> eshlox: within the function's scope, you can change thigns like uploader.debug = true; etc
[02:50:54] <progzer> Though I don't understand your question completely either, what are you trying to change etc?
[02:51:02] <Cork> VictorCL_2: it sets a variable on the jquery support object that will be true if the browser support touch events
[02:51:17] <Cork> so all you do then is if($.support.touch_event) {} else {}
[02:51:25] <VictorCL_2> ok thanks
[02:51:42] <Cork> VictorCL_2: but like i said, skip the var part, it was a typo
[02:51:54] <VictorCL_2> ok
[02:51:59] <Cork> "$.support.touch_event = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement);" is all you need
[02:52:12] <Cork> and it only needs to be run once when the page loads
[02:52:30] <VictorCL_2> Cork should I put that inside document.ready ?
[02:52:48] <Cork> actaully no
[02:53:12] <Cork> you should load it at the same time that plugins is normally loaded
[02:53:24] <VictorCL_2> ok .. will test it
[02:53:56] <eshlox> progzer: this is script for uploading files, i want change some variable when files are in db, so.. i want do something and after this change variable in this class
[02:54:02] <Cork> so an (function($) { $.support.touch_event = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement); })(jQuery);
[02:54:15] <Cork> and put that before your ready event
[02:56:34] <bonhoffer> i'm struggling here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lvdwj/4/
[02:56:52] <bonhoffer> wow -- sorry jsfiddle is slow today
[02:58:45] <bonhoffer> just trying to hide a div and change it's class
[03:01:01] <donCams> how do I check an array for a certain value then remove that along with the key
[03:01:17] <Cork> with the key?
[03:01:31] <Cork> your talking about an object or an array of objects?
[03:02:09] <donCams> sorry, somebody in ##javascript answered already
[03:02:27] <Cork> donCams: ask in one channel at a time....
[03:05:59] <dancar> can someone unblock a IP adres ? we cant acces jquery anymore
[03:06:03] <dancar> ??
[03:06:10] <progzer> eshlox: I don't know about the FileUploaderBasic that you're using, but if you want to change something on the server side (in the DB?), you'd do that on your server side scripts.
[03:06:51] <progzer> If you want to change something after the upload has completed (on the client side), the perhaps there's a callback in FilUploaderBasic ?
[03:07:11] <sviatovigt> how can I know when post() is still loading data from the server, it finished, and request was successful?
[03:10:55] <dancar> IP adress to unblock is 85.90.88.29, can someone help me please!
[03:11:26] <eshlox> progzer: i using http://valums.com/ajax-upload/ and i want send info about sended file, server side backends return json and this script catch this, i dont know how send another json to this script, example file names from db
[03:13:31] <donCams> dancar, isn't that off-topic? hidemyass.com
[03:14:04] <dancar> doncams whats youre problem?
[03:16:30] <donCams> that's a real site btw
[03:16:53] <progzer> eshlox: I'm still unclear on your question, maybe you can pastebin something clearer. Looking at the ajax-upload page you sent, it says there's a onComplete callback.
[03:17:47] <progzer> That's tell you as and when and which file completed uploading.
[03:17:51] <progzer> *That'll
[03:19:25] <StevenCodes22> anyone know a good irc to chat for states in US
[03:21:41] <eshlox> progzer: http://pastebin.com/pecKXZCY function works ok, when i choose file then script run url in action, upload files and return json data: {"path": "http://domain/site_media/static/uploads/water_fire_elements-wallpaper-2560x1600.jpg.100x100_q85_crop-smart.jpg", "success": true, "filename": "water_fire_elements-wallpaper-2560x1600.jpg"}
[03:22:26] <eshlox> below i want run url using $.ajax which return this same syntax json
[03:22:50] <eshlox> but i dont know how pass this to this script ;->
[03:23:42] <eshlox> so i need inform script that this files are uploaded and should run only onComplete function
[03:26:25] <donCams> how do I detect changes in the document?
[03:26:43] <progzer> eshlox: Between line 30 and 31, in the code you pasted, you might want to call your $.ajax action
[03:27:50] <progzer> onComplete doesn't actually run till the file has completed uploading. So any you code you want to run AFTER the upload should be added in it. Code to run after the upload doesn't have to be added AFTER this whole script (line 51).
[03:29:39] <eshlox> progzer: i dont thinks so ;-) becouse i want run my $.ajax after script/site are loaded
[03:43:29] <mindis|wurk> hmm. does .hover() not trigger events continously?
[03:44:33] <anoob> I'm using a snippet (http://jsfiddle.net/NpspZ/1/) to detect if an element overflows the document... i don't want to show an horizontal scroll. This is the running site: http://aguiacarretinhas.com.br/testes/. It works fine on FF, Chrome but fail on IE (1024x768 resolution) ...)
[03:46:36] <anoob> script: http://aguiacarretinhas.com.br/testes/media/javascript/scripts.js
[03:48:18] <osfameron> morning all!
[03:48:32] <osfameron> .ajax says that if dataType:'html', then "included script tags are evaluated when inserted in the DOM."
[03:48:35] <osfameron> But that doesn't seem to be the case.
[03:49:05] <osfameron> e.g., I have some included <script> tags that aren't getting run either by .ajaxSubmit, nor on .replaceWith(data)
[03:49:24] <johanhar> how can I manipulate elements inside an iframe?
[03:49:30] <osfameron> (I know .ajaxSubmit isn't .ajax, exactly.  But the docs for the former say that it accepts everything that .ajax accepts, which suggest that it's passed through?)
[03:50:36] <johanhar> .contents() maybe..
[03:58:19] <_dave_h_d> hi all when iOS safari gives me a syntax error, is there any way of viewing the code where the error is?
[03:58:30] <_dave_h_d> this is in debug console
[04:00:47] <Putr> hi! Does $().accordian() need anything else apart from UI core and UI widget? (i'm getting an accordian is not a function error on a page where both libraries are loaded)
[04:03:08] <Assid> okay i have a very very strange issue when accessing a page through jquery mobile
[04:03:37] <ryannathans> we can shake hands. I have a very very strange issue.
[04:03:56] <Assid> if i access the page direct .. then <ul> follows list-style: none .. but if i come through another page,..then it gives me the discs
[04:04:49] <osfameron> Hah. #jquery really hasn't built up a community has it?
[04:06:34] <angelkoilov> osfameron: u can ask cleaverbot

[04:07:17] <osfameron> angelkoilov: sounds dangeous ;-)
[04:07:19] <Assid> or rather any jquerymobile A grade browser
[04:07:31] <Assid> and see the same in a web browser on the pc..
[04:07:43] <Assid> im getting ul discs
[04:14:33] <ph88> after i have my list sorted with this http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/  how do i make it auto-submit (after a move action has been done) with AJAX so i can save the order in a database ?
[04:17:02] <Assid> okay this isnt making sense..
[04:17:47] <ryannathans> on https://wegift.org the register form works fine the first attempt, but say if you get something wrong, on the second attempt+ it will POST the data twice, resulting in a 'you have already registered' error. The script is visible at https://wegift.org/ajaxregister.php   can someone please have a look and tell me what's going on. I am certain the ajax is running twice, I just don't know why.
[04:24:41] <Assid_> hmm
[04:25:15] <Assid> can someone please help me with this?
[04:25:31] <Assid> the disc isnt going away.. and photoswipe doesnt want to work
[04:31:40] <aFeijo> good morning, I'm searching a way to locate all elements that has a name that start with field_urgency, my last attempt was $('select[name^=field_urgency]'). What is the right syntax?
[04:32:13] <Cork> aFeijo: yes
[04:32:23] <Cork> uh. i meant that should be the correct syntax
[04:32:32] <aFeijo> w00t? wth
[04:32:40] <aFeijo> I ran it thru firebug, returned null
[04:32:47] <aFeijo> argh
[04:32:59] <Cork> is the element you want to select input or something?
[04:33:11] <aFeijo> oh wait, I've got it
[04:33:22] <aFeijo> in firebug, I shall use jQuery() and not $(), I forgot that that changed
[04:33:23] <aFeijo> lol
[04:33:30] <Cork> :)
[04:33:44] <aFeijo> Cork, thanks for confirming that I was in the right track, heh
[04:34:01] <Cork> np
[04:34:23] <ph88> how do i get the order of the list in javascript as comma seperated values? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[04:35:04] <aFeijo> Cork, for 2 elements, I need to repeat the select[name=] separating with a comma, right?
[04:35:12] <Cork> yes
[04:35:17] <aFeijo> obrigado
[04:37:35] <Assid> can someone please help me with this?
[04:38:23] <Assid> m.worldoforo.com > links > oro collection (please try on iphone/android) and on chrome
[04:39:01] <Assid> A> the list-type isnt working.. B> images wont work with photoswipe
[04:41:28] <Assid> muhahaha found a way around it
[04:47:31] <Assid> crap cant find a way around this
[05:12:47] <Guest41973> hello
[05:12:58] <Guest41973> ~soap ?
[05:13:56] <ericandrewlewis> shouldn't this give me the ID of the targeted element?
[05:13:56] <ericandrewlewis> $("div.elementclass").click( function( el ) { alert( jQuery(el).attr('id') ) } );
[05:15:42] <ericandrewlewis> hmm ended up achieving it with $("div.elementclass").click( function() { alert( jQuery(this).attr('id') ) } );
[05:15:54] <equivoc> ericandrewlewis: the latter is fine
[05:16:27] <equivoc> for the former: function(event) { /* event.target is the clicked element */ }
[05:16:40] <equivoc> so the callback gets the event passed not the element
[05:17:18] <equivoc> besides, this refers to the element, as the callback is called in the execution context of the element
[05:18:11] <Guest41973> hi, what to use for SOAP?
[05:18:23] <Hooloovoork> Guest41973: ?
[05:19:18] <rue> Guest41973: You probably *really* don't want to use SOAP via your frontend (?)
[05:19:19] <Guest41973> jquery soap libray?
[05:19:43] <Guest41973> i hear it is a bad solution...
[05:20:32] <Guest98739> i am using jquery.tmpl.js plugin...when a pass a array of objects to it..it renders the correct number of rows..but the text is empty
[05:20:44] <Guest98739> anybody has any pointers on how to debug that
[05:21:50] <angelkoilov> Guest98739: firebug + firequery
[05:22:17] <Guest98739> i am using console.log to see the object..it contains proper values..before calling tmpl function
[05:22:27] <Guest98739> not sure how can see in Tmpl function
[05:22:46] <Guest98739> are there any debug points which will log in tmpl plugin
[05:37:12] <poppiez> am I the only one getting an incorrect e.timeStamp value for mousedown in opera? it's negative
[05:45:03] <Zmanu> hello
[05:45:36] <eshlox> http://valums.com/ajax-upload/ its possible to run oncomplete function with own parameters when script is loaded?
[05:52:57] <Peeter> Does anyone know anything about "non_object_property_call"? Jquery throws an AJAX exception with that error message (no idea why though)
[05:56:27] <fris> Peeter are you loading multiple version of jquery?
[05:56:43] <Peeter> Shouldnt be.
[05:58:23] <nicholasschulz> Shouldn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/4AM8F/

[06:02:04] <Wiz_KeeD> can someone please suggest a good site prealoder??
[06:02:05] <Wiz_KeeD> please?
[06:04:21] <Wiz_KeeD> nodbody
[06:04:21] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[06:04:40] <ravenzz> preloader?
[06:05:20] <Whirl3d> Wiz_Keed, most folks on here would manually code their site to preload as necessary, that's why no one anwsered.
[06:07:18] <Wiz_KeeD> i want an animated image or a gif if you will that would dissapear as soon as all the images and content is loaded on the web-page, is there sn easy code for that Whirl3d ?
[06:08:01] <ravenzz> $(window).load(function(){ /* everything was loaded */ });
[06:08:13] <Wiz_KeeD> for real?
[06:08:31] <Wiz_KeeD> why have i found 2-3 prealoders on the net with a lot of code then? which don't fully work btw
[06:09:44] <dmsuperman> What's the best way to insert about 1000 nodes into the DOM when they're all a clone of one specific node with different text values swapped out?
[06:09:57] <dmsuperman> Without writing the HTML out in JS
[06:10:02] <Whirl3d> put everything that you want to preload in a div that has display:"none" and the animated gif before it and ravenzz code...where the function hides the gif, shows the div and voila.
[06:10:14] <dmsuperman> well I mean I get that but in terms of performance
[06:10:18] <dmsuperman> the browser locks up when that happens
[06:10:27] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD try and see http://jsfiddle.net/ndXNu/
[06:10:41] <dmsuperman> oh nvm that wasn't at me lol
[06:10:49] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, sorry.
[06:11:22] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, where will you get the "text values swapped out"?
[06:11:42] <dmsuperman> I have a JSON array of objects
[06:11:54] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD perhaps those scripts implements other stuffs like a progress bar or something
[06:11:54] <dmsuperman> for each object I clone the record node, then swap out the values
[06:12:10] <Wiz_KeeD> ravenzz, you are right but there's much more code than just for a simple progress bar
[06:12:18] <Whirl3d> var elem.clone().text(nextText).appendTo(holder);
[06:12:23] <Wiz_KeeD> but i will get a huge image, place it theere as a benchmark and see if it works
[06:12:38] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, ignore the var...sry
[06:12:39] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: lol then my original response applies here
[06:12:43] <dmsuperman> 09:10 < dmsuperman> well I mean I get that but in terms of performance
[06:12:43] <dmsuperman> 09:10 < dmsuperman> the browser locks up when that happens
[06:12:47] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD yep that's what is on the fiddle i gave to you http://jsfiddle.net/ndXNu/
[06:12:52] <dmsuperman> for 1000 nodes, mind you
[06:13:00] <dmsuperman> each one has some stuff inside it
[06:13:18] <Whirl3d> where does the json data come from?
[06:13:30] <dmsuperman> irrelevant, but ajax
[06:13:50] <Whirl3d> could you preconfigure the nodes to be html then use ajax to load it?
[06:14:20] <Whirl3d> you could also do this:
[06:14:28] <dmsuperman> no, I'd very much rather not
[06:14:45] <Wiz_KeeD> uuh
[06:14:51] <Wiz_KeeD> seems to work great, no need for testing then
[06:15:00] <Wiz_KeeD> thank you very much ravenzz !
[06:15:05] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: the responses would be huge if it sent the html for every record
[06:15:06] <Whirl3d> $("elem").clone().attr("display","none').text(nexttext).appendTo(holder);
[06:15:09] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD anyway I'd avoid the "page" preloader. I'd rather user a placeholder for images.
[06:15:22] <dmsuperman> again, I understand how to actually write the code :P
[06:15:23] <ravenzz> while they are still loading
[06:15:27] <Wiz_KeeD> what do you mean by that ravenzz ?
[06:15:29] <dmsuperman> I'm more concnered with _performance_
[06:15:34] <dmsuperman> when I insert 1000 nodes the browser locks up
[06:15:42] <Whirl3d> then they aren't displayed, so they don't bog down the dom
[06:15:47] <Linex> whats the feature of jquery where a panel slide up from bottom when the cursor goes near the bottom ?
[06:15:58] <dmsuperman> well...I need them to be displayed lol
[06:16:06] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD eheh I'll try to be more clear. My english sucks
[06:16:13] <MrGando> Hey guys, has anyone used FancyBox to build an image gallery ? , I'm having an issue with it ( I posted it in Stack Overflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8942686/error-with-fancybox-grouped-elements-requested-content-cannot-be-loaded )
[06:16:18] <Whirl3d> once they are all appended (but not displayed) then displaying them is easy
[06:16:33] <Wiz_KeeD> it's not that, it's me being tired trust me ravenzz
[06:16:51] <dmsuperman> I have a feeling that the browser lock up is just going to be shifted until the display: block step by doing this
[06:16:52] <Wiz_KeeD> and a way to rotate an image around it's axis for as long as the loading takes ravenzz ?
[06:16:54] <dmsuperman> not avoiding the lock up
[06:17:06] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, tias
[06:19:02] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, http://www.tvidesign.co.uk/blog/improve-your-jquery-25-excellent-tips.aspx
[06:19:40] <Whirl3d> though I can't endorse the page (because I haven't read it all), they do show the time differences with loading 1000 simple list items both ways...
[06:21:08] <Wiz_KeeD> ravenzz,
[06:22:11] <ravenzz> 1 sec
[06:23:06] <Wiz_KeeD> ok ok
[06:25:36] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD http://jsfiddle.net/UVmzX/
[06:25:55] <Whirl3d> dmsuperman, you could also add the 1000 nodes as one long html string and then append it to the dom. That would even be faster, I am sure
[06:26:13] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: as I said, I can't build the HTML string in JS
[06:26:21] <dmsuperman> because it's based on a template that somebody else has access to edit
[06:26:21] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD in the meanwhile the user can read the text and other stuffs
[06:26:25] <dmsuperman> I can't assume it won't change
[06:26:41] <johanhar> If I got some variable with html, and do something like $("#somediv").html(html_from_somewhere_else) I lose the tags and "structure" of the HTML :(
[06:26:45] <Whirl3d> you have to have access to the item you want to clone, so get it's html
[06:26:52] <Whirl3d> if it changes, who cares?
[06:27:01] <Wiz_KeeD> what did you do here exactly ravenzz ?
[06:27:44] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD do you have chrome or ff?
[06:27:55] <Wiz_KeeD> ff
[06:27:58] <Wiz_KeeD> but i can also use chrome
[06:28:00] <Wiz_KeeD> why?
[06:28:08] <ravenzz> go in incognito mode
[06:28:12] <ravenzz> and run it
[06:28:15] <ravenzz> oh
[06:28:16] <ravenzz> wait
[06:28:42] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: you can get the entire HTML for an item, all of its attributes and all? .html() only returns the contents
[06:28:50] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD ok http://jsfiddle.net/WfLBe/
[06:28:57] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: The other thing is when I insert the values I have to do it by searching the nodes
[06:29:01] <dmsuperman> by class name
[06:29:14] <ryannathans> on https://wegift.org the register form works fine the first attempt, but say if you get something wrong, on the second attempt+ it will POST the data twice, resulting in a 'you have already registered' error. The script is visible at https://wegift.org/ajaxregister.php   can someone please have a look and tell me what's going on. I am certain the ajax is running twice, I just don't know why.

[06:30:38] <Aamir> dmsuperman:  window.load inside .ready?
[06:30:56] <dmsuperman> Aamir: er, what?
[06:31:00] <dmsuperman> that has nothing to do with my question
[06:31:11] <Aamir> ok
[06:31:55] <Aamir> dmsuperman:  post a clear example what you want to copy and where to paste
[06:32:00] <Aamir> insert*
[06:32:26] <dmsuperman> argh
[06:32:53] <Aamir> dmsuperman:  arch @ what?
[06:33:06] <dmsuperman> I fully comprehend how to use jquery to copy and move elemtns in the DOM. I'm specifically asking about the __performance__ and how to get it better when I'm doing it for about 1000 nodes at a time. Without generating the entire HTML as a string, because I can't manipulate the data like that
[06:33:28] <fatromeo_> hi
[06:33:41] <vicentimartins> how it works the function .children()?!
[06:33:53] <dmsuperman> vicentimartins: carefully
[06:33:58] <Wiz_KeeD> ravenzz, i think i don't need to read that
[06:34:04] <fatromeo_> Does anyone know whether eclipse indigo integrated with wasce 3.0 supports jsf 2.0???
[06:34:16] <Wiz_KeeD> i think i need to cover everything because the whole design is all over the site
[06:34:23] <Wiz_KeeD> can i cannot show text without showing grpahical elements
[06:34:30] <Aamir> dmsuperman:  create an empty object like $('<div>') and append stuff to it. finally append this div
[06:35:11] <dmsuperman> Aamir: And appending 1000 nodes to that newly created div won't have the exact same effect?
[06:36:04] <shomon> hi, I have a form with 2 buttons. with one I want to do a set of validations on the fields, but with the other, I need a different one. how can I do this with jquery?
[06:36:13] <shomon> or what library/tutorial/starting place can you suggest?
[06:36:18] <Aamir> dmsuperman:  newly created div is not inserted into the dom yet. you append all the shit to this div and once finished, insert this div into the dom
[06:36:37] <ravenzz> Wiz_KeeD why not? I could be interested on the article instead of images...and I wouldn't wait
[06:37:05] <Whirl3d> Amir, I have explained that, offered another option and he's afraid it wont work, but won't try it. Hope you have better luck
[06:37:18] <dmsuperman> Whirl3d: you're being a child now, grow up
[06:37:24] <dmsuperman> you never said anything about using an intermediary div
[06:37:31] <dmsuperman> which I'm trying now to test performance
[06:37:36] <dmsuperman> thanks Aamir
[06:37:57] <Wiz_KeeD> ther are also background images
[06:38:02] <Wiz_KeeD> which are the background of the text and etc
[06:38:04] <Aamir> :)
[06:38:09] <vicentimartins> dmsuperman: what?! I like to know how it work the function .children()! Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/NsStV/
[06:38:10] <ravenzz> mh k
[06:38:16] <Wiz_KeeD> the client doesn't want the user to see the images loading
[06:38:25] <ravenzz> anyway the idea is the samy
[06:38:27] <ravenzz> same
[06:38:39] <Wiz_KeeD> so ravenzz i just make a div with a fixed position and an image in the middle that loads up everytime, and when the loading is done i remove it from the dom??

[06:42:24] <Whirl3d> dmsupermann, sorry, I thought that "put everything that you want to preload in a div that has display:"none" was during our conversation..my bad
[06:42:33] <kba_> Is there a way to fix this? I'm guessing it's because it isn't listening on events in the loaded file

[07:00:55] <kba_> I can't seem to get 'on' to work
[07:01:21] <kba_> Oh wait, I just realized i'm using a too old version of jQuery.
[07:01:21] <NoiseEee> kba_: what version jquery?
[07:01:23] <kba_> never mind
[07:02:36] <Hooloovoork> fatromeo_: since i didn't even know what it was, no =P i'd never write java code. =P
[07:03:10] <fatromeo_> All Right Hooloovoork!! Thank You!!
[07:04:20] <kba_> I'm using dataTables, and I need to add an event listener for when a row is clicked. How would I do this?
[07:04:30] <kba_> $('#data tr').on("click", function(e) { isn't the solution
[07:04:41] <rookie84> hi
[07:05:19] <shomon> Hooloovoork, how do you do validation yourself? I'm doing it in the actual programming code once it's submitted. this is just the front end step.. so needs javascript at least...
[07:05:57] <shomon> and I guess your answer is that jquery alone can't do validation without plugins
[07:06:23] <rookie84> <div id="one"> <div id="two"> <div id="three"> whats the best way to get all these divs from the <div id="three">
[07:06:55] <Hooloovoork> shomon: of course it can. it just doesn't do it automatically.
[07:07:13] <shomon> ah okay sorry I'm a total newb.. just using it to print nice calendars
[07:07:19] <Hooloovoork> shomon: plugins make it easier. like just put a class on a input field and it'll validate it by some rules before submission.
[07:08:37] <Hooloovoork> submitting?
[07:08:48] <Hooloovoork> submission is something completely different, isn't it?
[07:09:03] <shomon> I do that in php
[07:09:07] <shomon> once it's submitted
[07:09:25] <shomon> this is just to show little tooltips like "you forgot this" when people press the button, before it actually submits the form
[07:09:28] <Hooloovoork> yes it's not safe to do it in JS, it's just nice to have front end validation
[07:09:49] <shomon> sure.. I can do the other validation, but I want to do that front end bit with jquery
[07:10:04] <shomon> just that looking through the net, all I find is these plugins
[07:10:08] <Hooloovoork> so do it. search for validation plugin jquery and read up
[07:10:15] <Hooloovoork> or build the validation on your own
[07:10:42] <Hooloovoork> if you don't know how to build it on your own then find a validation plugin and look through the code.
[07:10:56] <rookie84> <div id="one"> <div id="two"> <div id="three"> whats the best way to get all these divs from the <div id="three">
[07:11:20] <shomon> by build it on your own you mean just with javascript, or with some bits of jquery?
[07:11:21] <Hooloovoork> rookie84: depends on how the rest of the code looks.
[07:11:44] <Hooloovoork> shomon: you can use jquery if you want to. it's easier to do it with jquery.
[07:12:09] <rookie84> Hooloovoork: i've it done like this: $(this).parent('one').children('div');
[07:12:14] <rookie84> not sure if its the right way?
[07:12:51] <Hooloovoork> rookie84: if it works it's probably a right way.
[07:13:24] <is_null> hi all, how to detect that the user is dragging something ?
[07:13:33] <is_null> (using sortable from jquery-ui)
[07:13:43] <shomon> I can't understand. :(
[07:13:48] <shomon> oh well thanks anyway
[07:13:58] <NoiseEee> shomon: no point writing javascript if you don't know any javascript
[07:14:29] <rookie84> Hooloovoork: it does work, thanks
[07:14:39] <Hooloovoork> rookie84: sweet. gj!
[07:15:14] <sadmicrowave> could someone recommend a good UI tree view that I can use to stack months and years
[07:15:29] <NoiseEee> is_null: look at the Events tab in http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[07:15:37] <leoG_> @is_null : http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#event-drag
[07:18:43] <is_null> thanks, this brings the second question: is there a jquery-ish way to detect that some element has been hoovered for X seconds ?
[07:21:28] <kborchers> is_null: on mouseenter, you can setTimeout for the time you want to detect hover and execute what you want to happen after that timeout and use mouseleave to clearTimeout that timer you started to prevent it from executing if they leave
[07:24:35] <is_null> thanks

[07:26:19] <mllie> Hello
[07:26:55] <mllie> How can I fix fadeIn/fadeOut in ie8? Now I'm getting a black border during fading
[07:28:40] <kborchers> ow1n: you have to set a width for your menus. also you realise that is not released yet and so unsupported as of right now right?
[07:29:18] <ow1n> kborchers: The examples don't show the menu getting set an explicit width
[07:29:36] <ow1n> kborchers: And yes, I realize it's pre-release, but I'm impatient! :)
[07:30:08] <kborchers> ow1n: view source here http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html and look at lines 55 - 62
[07:30:23] <kborchers> specifically 57
[07:33:40] <is_null> kborchers: apparently jquery doesn't catch mouseover elements while dragging :(
[07:34:13] <ow1n> Okay, you're right kborchers, setting an explicit width fixes the problem. I was thrown off by the "left: -423px;" I was seeing in Firebug

[08:00:07] <pashmi56> hi, I am animating a elemnt to move up, how can i check if the element goes out of the window?
[08:01:20] <nicholasschulz> Hooloovoork: Any other page you recommend? soooooo annoying :-p
[08:03:03] <Hooloovoork> nicholasschulz: nope i have no clue if there are other like it. probably are tho... google =)
[08:03:13] <nicholasschulz> ok ;-)
[08:04:58] <mllie> NoiseEee: yes, I tried some of that, but cannot get it work
[08:06:22] <mllie> NoiseEee: do you know a solution that works?
[08:07:27] <NoiseEee> have you tried using a PNG-8 instead of PNG-24?
[08:07:40] <vasa> i found a fix for my problem, thanks
[08:07:46] <vasa> i used
[08:07:54] <mllie> NoiseEee: actually I cannot do that since it would be the user that uploads the image.
[08:08:02] <vasa> $("elementid").mousemove(recordMouse);
[08:08:06] <vasa> that did the trick
[08:08:14] <vasa> thanks for the help
[08:08:29] <mllie> NoiseEee: should need another solution
[08:08:57] <NoiseEee> mllie: then try http://forum.jquery.com/topic/transparent-png-shows-black-edges-in-ie8 or keep googling
[08:09:02] <NoiseEee> mllie: understand its an IE limitation

[08:12:35] <Linex> I'm trying to look for strings in a webpage and change the color fo the text. I can do the second part but how do I find the string? is the search() function deprecated ?
[08:14:53] <pifantastic> ?:content @ Linex
[08:14:54] <bot-t> Linex, .contents() - Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[08:14:57] <pifantastic> hmm
[08:14:58] <pifantastic> I mean
[08:15:01] <pifantastic> ?:contains
[08:15:02] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[08:15:07] <pifantastic> Linex: ^
[08:19:05] <Linex> pifantastic: but I want to make changes to the found text itself not the whole element that the text is found in.
[08:20:00] <pifantastic> Linex: So perhaps you could replace the HTML of the element that contains the text and wrap it in <span>'s
[08:20:31] <Linex> This does no  good to me  ->  $("div:contains('John')").css("text-decoration", "underline");
[08:21:42] <Linex> I will have a lot of "John" in the articles, and I want to for example change the text color of "John" to red.
[08:21:56] <NoiseEee> Linex: what pifantastic just said
[08:22:02] <pifantastic> Linex: just a sec
[08:23:02] <Linex> NoiseEee: is there no simpler way.
[08:23:37] <Linex> actually I just want to highlight certain strings in the body of the page.
[08:23:53] <NoiseEee> Linex: no, what you are asking for is not a simple task
[08:24:08] <Linex> NoiseEee: :) I realise it now.
[08:24:21] <NoiseEee> Linex: find the divs with content, then split up the content and find your actual word, put it in a span and add some stylin
[08:24:36] <Linex> it seemed like a simple thing to do but I realise now its not.
[08:24:46] <pifantastic> Linex: to get you started: http://jsfiddle.net/FBNqQ/
[08:25:06] <pifantastic> Linex: but understand that's not going to be very fast for large web pages
[08:25:06] <Linex> NoiseEee: hmm, yeah I can guess its something like that
[08:25:15] <Linex> pifantastic: thank you.

[09:07:50] <supsup> jeffkisel: why should it be 2?  u are saying first td, first visible div which being first would always be 1?
[09:08:13] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: but you're going to have to wait for the new window to load everythign
[09:08:15] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: p.?
[09:08:29] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: give the window.opener a variable, reference it by the variable
[09:08:32] <jeffsmykil> oh the var
[09:08:48] <jeffsmykil> ty
[09:09:30] <jeffsmykil> if its a function how far do i need to go?
[09:09:37] <jeffsmykil> window.opener...
[09:09:44] <jeffsmykil> to document?
[09:10:54] <NoiseEee> as long as its defined in the new document, you just need to call windowVar.functionName() iirc, but try it and see
[09:13:33] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: window.opener.Update is not a function
[09:13:34] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[09:13:39] <MrTrick> I'm after a jquery plugin where I can pass it an object array and it builds an editable Table, with 'create','edit','delete', and something to change row order... and something to submit the data back to the server. Any suggestions?
[09:14:10] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: again, if you're doing them back to back, you're not giving the new window any time to load JS, the DOM, etc
[09:14:36] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: it relies on a button click to run the function
[09:14:43] <jeffsmykil> both pages are loaded

[09:17:21] <wiwillia> Alright - I want to trigger a function in the middle of an animation.  Currently I have one animation run, then run the function, then run a second animation.  But this produces a "jerky" effect on the original animation (I'd like it to be smooth).  So I'm trying to either figure out how to get rid of the jerky slowing, then speeding up motion - or find another way to trigger an event mid-animation
[09:17:29] <wiwillia> http://voostmedia.com/discoverly/ <- press search to see what I mean
[09:18:38] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: why are you getting "window.opener.Update" is not a function, versus "p.Update() is not a function?
[09:19:21] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: it shouldn't make a difference should it?
[09:19:32] <NoiseEee> i told you to use a var, yes?
[09:19:46] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: you'll find this works properly:  https://gist.github.com/1648522
[09:19:49] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[09:20:00] <jeffsmykil> p.Update is not a function
[09:21:14] <jeffsmykil> the function is in the parent
[09:21:16] <jeffsmykil> not the child
[09:21:16] <dogmatic69> it seems the problem is that google charts renders in a iframe. Is it normal that loading a div with an iframe into a dialogue box will empty the iframe?

[09:31:56] <fission6> khmer: how would i fit this into the code block i pasted khmer ?
[09:33:22] <wiwillia> When you have a step in your animation, where do you put the speed of the animation?  Between the animation and step
[09:33:26] <wiwillia> or after the step?
[09:33:37] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: I think I found the problem...
[09:33:58] <jeffsmykil> oh wait

[09:41:48] <NoiseEee> you know your logic is all != on the default values right nicholasschulz?

[09:42:24] <jmedwards> I'm using .position() to position a drop down menu. However, when the menu is longer than the viewport, it completely throws off the top: offset calculation and positions the menu well off-screen. Is there a .position() and viewport nuance I'm missing?
[09:42:31] <fission6> how do i properly return info in this structure - http://dpaste.org/xSPLU/

[09:44:12] <jeffkiesel> how do i get the number of table rows that have a visible div in their first td?  http://jsfiddle.net/LDPVG/1/
[09:45:00] <jmedwards> here is the code I am using to position: http://pastebin.com/B7GuEUUS
[09:45:11] <jeffkiesel> the answer should be 2, but my selector is not working properly
[09:47:52] <risked> Hi all, I am wondering if there's anything I can do to shorten down this function http://pastie.org/3220174 ?
[09:48:32] <pifantastic> risked: template.find('.actionButton, .primaryButton, .secondaryButton').on( etc...
[09:49:19] <risked> pifantastic, how do I invoke the individual callbacks then?
[09:49:49] <pifantastic> risked: you just need one callback since they're all identical
[09:50:01] <pifantastic> ohnsap
[09:50:03] <pifantastic> they aren't
[09:50:11] <pifantastic> nevermind
[09:50:31] <smolly> When I click on a text I want a textarea-form show up so I can edit the text, what is this function called?
[09:50:43] <NoiseEee> jkies00: i don't think what you want is possible in one seletor, here's a function that may be terrible or might be correct: http://jsfiddle.net/LDPVG/3/
[09:52:00] <nicholasschulz> When I use load(); to get a page that has some JS action on it; will the variables that are set on the page loaded also be set on the main page???? Do you understand or was that poorly explained? :-p
[09:52:06] <Blazento> how can i use append to append after or before a certain element.... for instance <ul class="pagination"><li class="prev"><a>Prev</a></li><li class="next"><a>Next</a></li><ul>... what would i use to insert a bunch of <li>'s after the <li class="prev"> ? When I try $('.prev').append(<li>); it will nest it inside the prev li
[09:52:21] <jkies00> thx NoiseEee , i will check that out
[09:52:33] <jonkristian> pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/BS9e7/
[09:52:52] <jonkristian> pifantastic: can add the checkbox, but i want to remove or disable it if it is checked again.
[09:53:13] <pifantastic> ?on @ jonkristian
[09:53:13] <bot-t> jonkristian, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:53:26] <jonkristian> ah ok
[09:53:44] <jonkristian> however, shouldn't this also work?
[09:54:37] <pifantastic> jonkristian: nope, that only binds the changed event to the checkboxes that exist when the code runs initially
[09:54:47] <pifantastic> any newly created checkboxes will not have the bound event
[09:55:22] <jonkristian> pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/BS9e7/1/
[09:56:20] <NoiseEee> jonkristian: read pifantastic last sentence
[09:56:28] <NoiseEee> or 2 even
[09:56:55] <jonkristian> ah
[09:57:08] <jonkristian> How can I make them work after page load? live?
[09:58:20] <NoiseEee> your best bet is event delegation, jonkristian
[09:58:23] <NoiseEee> jonkristian: http://jsfiddle.net/BS9e7/2/
[09:58:40] <NoiseEee> you'll probably want to make the selector a bit more selective assuming you'll have other inputs on the page
[09:59:20] <snagnever> how can i avoid a link from being clicked?
[09:59:29] <jonkristian> NoiseEee: thank you very much, yes I will make them more selective, actually i am doing something else rather than removing the checkboxes, thanks:)
[09:59:36] <NoiseEee> snagnever: break the users arm?
[10:00:05] <nicholasschulz> When I use load(); to get a page that has some JS action on it; will the variables that are set on the page loaded also be set on the main page???? Do you understand or was that poorly explained?
[10:00:08] <snagnever> noiseee good idea
[10:00:32] <snagnever> .on('click', user.breakArm);
[10:00:56] <NoiseEee> snagnever: do you mean to say 'how can i avoid a link taking the user to a new page / the href'  ?
[10:02:00] <snagnever> noiseee yes. but i don't want to lose the href. i want a behavior simillar to the disabled attribute on inputs
[10:02:19] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:02:21] <nicholasschulz> snag ever : prevent.default
[10:02:34] <Whirl3d> if I want to change the select element's options into an array of objects, can I use: var lst=$("select option").map(function (i) {return ({$(this).text():$(this).attr('value')});});   ?
[10:03:23] <danheberden> Whirl3d you can't make object keys like that
[10:03:33] <felipe_Brz> If I want to fetch the component whose class is portlet which is within the component whose id is yw1, then this $("#yw1 .portlet") is correct, no? just like css
[10:03:52] <danheberden> you have to do var returnObj = {}; returnObj[ $(this).text() ] = value; kinda thing
[10:04:10] <snagnever> $('#pending_box .buttons *').on('click',function(evt){evt.preventDefault()}); ?
[10:04:17] <danheberden> felipe_Brz correct
[10:04:26] <felipe_Brz> danheberden:  cool thanks
[10:04:27] <Whirl3d> didn't think so. Thought maybe jquery did some of its "magic" to make it work, shucks. Thanks for the reply
[10:04:39] <danheberden> Whirl3d it's still javascript :)
[10:04:50] <danheberden> snagnever you can omit the * in that
[10:05:05] <danheberden> jsut capture the single event on the parent
[10:05:11] <danheberden> instead of binding an event to every child
[10:05:59] <danheberden> or use delegate via on, like $( '#pending_Box').on( 'click', '.buttons', fn )
[10:07:37] <fission6> how would i block a function call meaning dont continue until that function call returns
[10:07:52] <snagnever> danheberden genious! omitting the * is exactly what i want... i have: <div class='buttons'><a> <a> <a></div> and i want they to be clickable again after the data is loaded
[10:07:58] <snagnever> thanks
[10:08:14] <danheberden> of course - remember, event bubbling is your friend
[10:08:36] <danheberden> or the person you call when you're all drunk and lonely
[10:08:38] <danheberden> BUT WHATEVER
[10:13:05] <fission6> anyone want to review and help me get this working, seems like 4 and 5 don't execute in the flow i expect - i was hoping for line 4 to block until info is properly returned - http://dpaste.org/Zg7Ff/
[10:13:46] <Whirl3d> does $.unique still work? http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/N4udE/5/
[10:14:19] <sontek> Why would this happen: http://paste2.org/p/1876582
[10:14:23] <Whirl3d> oh, wait, I think I just figured it out.
[10:14:32] <sontek> My form has inputs filled out, but $("form").serialize() returns nothing
[10:14:41] <sontek> but I can grab the inputs individually
[10:15:09] <sontek> should I handle form submit rather than button click or something?
[10:16:35] <sontek> that didn't help
[10:16:37] <fission6> dah this is killing me
[10:17:27] <risked> Will the second condition for an if() be evaluated if the first condition was false?
[10:18:23] <TheoMurpse> I have a website I inherited that imports a never ending list of JS files. One of these files assigns a class to all INPUT tags. I have created a JS file with $(function(){$(foo).removeClass('bar');} but it doesn't remove the class. HOwever, after the page is fully loaded, I can go to firebug's console and issue the command $(foo).removeClass('bar') and this works perfectly. What could be the problem? And is there a way to ensure
[10:18:23] <TheoMurpse>  certain JS is performed /last/ (in this way I can make sure my .removeClass is effective for sure.)
[10:18:46] <TheoMurpse> Also, I don't know what file adds the class in the first place or how. TOo many files to go through and look.
[10:19:14] <TheoMurpse> Regardless, it's a file I shouldn't be modifying, so I have no way to fix it that way.
[10:19:55] <sontek> I even tried handling submit with the event argument and doing $(e.currentTarget).serialize() and serializeArray and got nothing
[10:20:17] <risked> have you tried $(document).ready?
[10:20:33] <TheoMurpse> risked, isn't $(document).ready the same thing as $(function(){})?
[10:20:38] <TheoMurpse> I thought they were equivalent.
[10:21:08] <rhizmoe> TheoMurpse: i'm out of my depth, but i imagine there's something in there that stops propagation/bubbling. i feel your pain, though.
[10:21:10] <TheoMurpse> yes, they are: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[10:21:46] <rhizmoe> TheoMurpse: sounds like mortgage-driven development regardless
[10:21:49] <TheoMurpse> The problem is I have no idea what is adding this class and no way of disabling it. The project I'm on, the code that adds all the JS files is outside my scope to modify. I have no choice but to just code some "undo" code.

[10:31:54] <ryanneufeld> So, I need to inject a script tag in the middle of some html
[10:32:22] <ryanneufeld> but I need to do it right at the point of execution without using document.write()
[10:32:34] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to do that with an inline script?
[10:32:45] <chovy> ryanneufeld: what do you want?
[10:33:11] <ryanneufeld> chovy: it's for ads on our site
[10:33:11] <chovy> var div = document.getElmentById('iwantthisdiv'); // doesn't work?
[10:33:33] <ryanneufeld> chovy: it would, but iwantthidiv is different each page it's on
[10:33:51] <ryanneufeld> basically I need the parent element to the script tag
[10:35:49] <nicholasschulz> This might be a stupid question, but can I just make my own attribute? like <div info='someInformation'> ???
[10:35:58] <ryanneufeld> nicholasschulz: yes
[10:36:06] <ryanneufeld> nicholasschulz: but you might want to use data-info instead
[10:36:18] <ryanneufeld> then you can use jquery's data methods

[10:37:39] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[10:38:08] <MagePsycho> $.debounce is necessary for onkeyup ajax request?
[10:38:53] <chovy> ryanneufeld: hmmm.
[10:39:06] <bnb_dev> i have an ul li with 3000 length, when i hide ul li it's taking too much time
[10:39:10] <ryanneufeld> chovy: I just realized though, I can put a class on the script tag
[10:39:16] <ryanneufeld> chovy: that I can reliably get
[10:39:17] <bnb_dev> is there any solution for that?
[10:39:32] <ryanneufeld> bnb_dev: yeah, use less lis ?
[10:39:59] <ryanneufeld> bnb_dev: have you tried just hiding the ul instead?
[10:40:15] <bnb_dev> yes
[10:40:15] <ryanneufeld> hiding the li's might be causing redraws
[10:40:26] <bnb_dev> i built a drop down with ul li
[10:40:38] <ryanneufeld> bnb_dev: and it has 3000 entries in it?
[10:40:43] <bnb_dev> and when i select yes
[10:41:03] <bnb_dev> these entries coming from data base table
[10:41:03] <chovy> ryanneufeld: yes. i was just going to suggest an id.
[10:41:23] <nicholasschulz> How do I make a variable work across multiple pages?
[10:41:24] <ryanneufeld> chovy: yeah, I can control the script tag, so that's doable
[10:41:29] <ryanneufeld> nicholasschulz: you don't
[10:41:34] <nicholasschulz> ok :-P
[10:41:38] <ryanneufeld> nicholasschulz: you'd need a cookie, or local storage
[10:41:40] <MagePsycho> any idea on this plugin $.debounce
[10:41:46] <nicholasschulz> I see.
[10:41:56] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: is that a question?
[10:42:02] <MagePsycho> yah
[10:42:19] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: what is it you're asking?
[10:43:00] <MagePsycho> i want to add some delay on onkeup ajax search and come with that $.debounce

[10:44:54] <MagePsycho> ryanneufeld: really not but i can write english ;)
[10:45:26] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: okay then. What is it that you're trying to do? (your question isn't really making any sense)

[10:46:22] <MagePsycho> Not-debounced AJAX request executed:  VS Debounced AJAX request executed:
[10:46:59] <MagePsycho> i liked the Debounced ajax request concept . because this kinda search is more realistic and gives less load to server

[10:49:28] <MagePsycho> any idea ryanneufeld?
[10:50:08] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: okay, so you like that. Are you asking how you can use his plugin to do an ajax search?
[10:51:10] <MagePsycho> yes i liked this and want to implement in http://www.panzit.com/bearings
[10:52:07] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: okay, so do it!

[10:53:22] <MagePsycho> sorry for being not clear
[10:53:45] <ryanneufeld> MagePsycho: I wouldn't to be honest. ben_alman is one of the best JS devs out there, I'd trust his code over my own

[11:09:10] <fullsailor> JavaScript does not have a native Set implementation.
[11:09:28] <fullsailor> Your best bet would be to test if the value is in the array, then push it in.
[11:10:46] <jeffreylevesque> anyone care to tell me why my rotator http://jsfiddle.net/YpW3a/13/ is slowing down my browser? I think it's accumulating setTimeouts() -- though I thought I was clearing them with clearing them with clearTimeout():
[11:17:20] <JJMalina> How would one check whether an element, like an text input or textarea, currently has focus
[11:19:05] <fullsailor> $(input).is(':focus')
[11:19:31] <JJMalina> fullsailor: thanks!
[11:19:35] <someprimetime> say i am setting an attribute in the html such as infinite="true" and i'm checking for the existence of that variable in my code such as: var infinite = $('selector').attr('infinite');  should my logic to check to see if it exists be: if(infinite && infinite === 'true')?
[11:19:46] <fullsailor> You're welcome JJMalina
[11:21:02] <NoiseEee> someprimetime: consider using valid html.
[11:21:03] <fullsailor> That seems acceptable.
[11:21:19] <someprimetime> well ok data-infinite="true"
[11:21:24] <fullsailor> Are you using HTML5; consider using data-infinite=true
[11:21:27] <nicholasschulz> I have <div class='SomeClass'> .. This class defines height and everything.. Can I use jquery to add a different class (that ONLY updates border-color etc) while the Div keeps the height and width from the last class??
[11:21:30] <someprimetime> and $('selector').data('infinite')
[11:21:35] <someprimetime> yeah, this isn't html5
[11:21:47] <someprimetime> but my logic, that makes sense right?
[11:22:04] <someprimetime> i'm checking to see if the variable is not false, and that it also equals true within the html
[11:22:36] <NoiseEee> nicholasschulz: you can either set the css styles on the element itself, or add a class that only define the border-color
[11:22:45] <fullsailor> nicholasschulz:  Yep. $(el).addClass('newClass') will retain the old class
[11:22:59] <nicholasschulz> thanks fullsailor

[11:35:55] <calimike> Hey guys, I have an interesting problem I'd like to solve for. There is a huge image on a remote location that I would like to render quickly as a thumbnail. I don't want the client to download the whole thing first and I can't reprocess the image on the server.
[11:36:29] <jedimind> so...
[11:36:32] <calimike> Is there a library out there that will shrink or reduce the quality of the image as it's being processed by the browser?
[11:36:36] <jedimind> this is #jquery not #blackmagic
[11:36:47] <fullsailor> calimike: You can't get blood from a stone.
[11:36:48] <jedimind> no because the browser would have to download the whole image first
[11:36:50] <jedimind> before it could do it
[11:36:53] <tash> is there a simple way to have a form pop up when you click on a button?
[11:37:11] <tash> I want a 2 field form with 2 buttons ... submit and cancel
[11:37:14] <calimike> I thought it might be a stretch.
[11:37:19] <jedimind> tash, yes
[11:37:27] <jedimind> use a combination of html, css, and javascript
[11:37:33] <jedimind> and you can acheive it with relative ease
[11:38:56] <calimike> I understand. I just want to let the browser avoid rendering the whole thing. Actually, the browser originally uploaded the image. I wonder if the browser is sophisticated enough to know it's the same version or if I need to reference it somehow.
[11:39:23] <someprimetime> yo why is my prevent default not working here: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/14/
[11:39:30] <someprimetime> click on the arrow and then click anywhere else
[11:39:30] <MagePsycho> i make a use of $.debound and req.abort() and onkeyup worked fine..
[11:39:59] <aca20031> Atm im doing my own drag and  drop thing, but as you move the mouse around the page with the button held, it tries to select text on the page. Can i prevent this?

[11:40:24] <Nate__> Can anyone help me understand how to select a class within a list on jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/nategines/7XrUk/
[11:41:00] <calimike> ok, possible solution..there is a flash uploader that is uploading the image as a multipart. Can I intercept the image once it's uploaded and cache it for display as a thumbnail?
[11:41:14] <calimike> (on the client)
[11:42:12] <jChristoph> Is there a way to select all nodes that has a data attribute whose value is > an arbitrary number?
[11:42:17] <fullsailor> Nate__ $().index() is always returning 0
[11:42:48] <fullsailor> When you uses .index() on a passed in collection DOM element it returns the index from that collection.
[11:42:55] <Eviltwin> jChristoph: No, you're going to have to filter using a function
[11:43:07] <fullsailor> In this case you passed in this
[11:43:29] <someprimetime> actually, try clicking on the down arrow now: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/15/
[11:43:36] <someprimetime> how come the popup is fading out?
[11:45:33] <Mohsen_Hassani> I have this if ($(this).val() <= 2)  in my jquery codes, and it works good, but I don't know why from <= to the end of the code, the font is displayed red in Geany
[11:47:13] <fullsailor> Mohsen_Hassani: Something is wrong with the editor.
[11:47:15] <kborchers> Mohsen_Hassani: that's an issue with Geany, not jQuery

[11:47:40] <Mawalu> My code does not run. I have think a lot of time about it, but I can't finde the error.  http://jsfiddle.net/Zhs59/
[11:49:51] <felipe_Brz> would anybody care to see why this code doesn't do what I expect? it's fully commented. http://pastie.org/3220749

[11:50:22] <ironfroggy_> Is there any reasonable way to convert the element type of a dom node?
[11:50:46] <ironfroggy_> that is, make a <span> a <a> or the other way around?

[11:58:40] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I access my JSON values via their names, not indexes?
[11:59:15] <McBoingBo> can someone tell me whats wrong with my code? http://jsfiddle.net/8LQZM/
[12:00:09] <fullsailor> ironfroggy_: No simple method that I'm aware of.
[12:00:53] <fullsailor> ironfroggy_: You'd need to detatch the contents create a new element, attach the contents to the new element, replace the old element with the new one.
[12:01:22] <McBoingBo> trying to make a change to variable $mode when clicking on a specific href
[12:01:42] <davidwalsh> Anyone here like Soh Tanaka's jQuery tutorials?
[12:02:15] <Mohsen_Hassani> I need to access the value of "age"  from its name via its index. Like==>  json["Student"].age   NOT==>  json[0].age
[12:03:02] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: you should be able to do that.
[12:03:07] <NoiseEee> just like you wrote.
[12:03:17] <NoiseEee> json['Student'].age
[12:04:13] <ironfroggy_> fullsailor: thought so. but i cant see an obvious way to copy or enumerate all the attributes of an element to do that.
[12:05:12] <fullsailor> ironfroggy_: Yeah the other problem comes from losing  events and other data.
[12:05:21] <fullsailor> Why do you need to change the element?
[12:05:29] <ironfroggy_> some times it is a link and other times not
[12:05:56] <fullsailor> I think I would just disable the click event when you want it to act like a span.
[12:05:57] <ironfroggy_> its a clientside gallery, the credit field sometimes is a link but not always
[12:06:09] <ironfroggy_> i tried, but then its still styled as a link
[12:06:38] <Mohsen_Hassani> NoiseEee, I can access it like this json[0].cities) but not json["Fars"].cities)
[12:06:42] <felipe_Brz> could anybody tell me why this doesn't work?
[12:06:43] <fullsailor> consider creating a class like .no-link
[12:06:45] <felipe_Brz> http://pastie.org/3220749
[12:06:47] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: pastebin the JSON
[12:07:04] <NoiseEee> im guessing what you have is an array of objects.
[12:07:28] <Mohsen_Hassani> NoiseEee, Thanks :) http://dpaste.com/691058/
[12:07:48] <wiwillia> During a jQuery animation, can you animate the opacity of a child?  Or queue a simultaneous animation on a different, nested, element?
[12:08:26] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: you have an array, you need to iterate through the array to get to each object representation

[12:12:26] <EricBGSU> anyone help me out, I have page open, I need to get the values inside the select drop down...can I do this using the console in firebug + jquery
[12:12:43] <wiwillia> Anyone have an idea about the nested/subsequent jquery animation?
[12:13:07] <ironfroggy_> fullsailor: thought of that but cant trust there isnt a style somewhere it wouldnt conflict with
[12:15:21] <xp_prg> how do you get the row # of a tr row in a table?
[12:15:42] <ryanneufeld> hey ben_alman
[12:15:44] <fullsailor> EricBGSU: $('select option').map(function(){ $(this).prop('value') })
[12:16:01] <fullsailor> EricBGSU: Off the top of my head.
[12:16:05] <ryanneufeld> ben_alman: I was wondering if you could apply your doc.write exp to this http://jsfiddle.net/VmjNz/2/
[12:16:53] <EricBGSU> thanks...keeps seeling select option as null
[12:16:56] <EricBGSU> don't et it
[12:16:58] <EricBGSU> get it
[12:17:36] <EricBGSU> there's only one select box on the page..in fact the page is pretty much just a select list
[12:18:28] <fullsailor> ironfroggy_: When you create the credit element, couldn't you use the appropriate element type? I'm assuming somekind of next/previous links.
[12:18:39] <felipe_Brz> why does the content div disappear if I move onto it???? it should disappear only if the mouse was out of the whole container div!!!! http://jsfiddle.net/ZhmeL/1/
[12:18:48] <fullsailor> ironfroggy_: You could also have both there. And show/hide the appropriate one.
[12:19:13] <fullsailor> EricBGSU: Jsfiddle?

[12:26:44] <aca20031> but obviously not that.

[12:31:40] <HS^> hi, when you have a draggable, and use connectToSortable to make it drop on a sortable, how would you drop the actual helper instead of the original item\
[12:40:01] <NoiseEee> HS^: you're dropping the helper, are you not?
[12:40:01] <Mohsen_Hassani> Why doesn't this work? var province = $("#province_combobox").val();        alert(json[0].province); If I alert(json[0].NewYork); it works
[12:40:55] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: if province is dynamic, you need to do  json[0][province]
[12:41:09] <someprimetime> what's going on with this: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/15/ when you click on the down arrow
[12:41:11] <NoiseEee> otherwise province is assumed to be an actual property of json[0]
[12:41:21] <someprimetime> it's automatically fading it out, even though I'm preventing propagation
[12:42:29] <Mohsen_Hassani> NoiseEee, WOW... :) It worked:) Thanks:)
[12:42:42] <Mohsen_Hassani> NoiseEee, I wish I were you dude! :)
[12:43:02] <someprimetime> Mohsen_Hassani: careful what you wish for B)
[12:43:14] <Mohsen_Hassani> someprimetime, :))
[12:43:26] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: but you don't know all the horrible, horrible things about me
[12:43:32] <NoiseEee> Mohsen_Hassani: but you're welcome
[12:44:06] <Mohsen_Hassani> NoiseEee, hhmm.... sure I don't know... But wherever you are, however you are...good luck my friend!
[12:44:41] <HS^> <NoiseEee> HS^: you're dropping the helper, are you not?
[12:45:06] <HS^> the helper is dragged,  but when dropped the original items shows in the sortable
[12:45:13] <HS^> i want to see the helper in the sortable
[12:45:19] <NoiseEee> HS^: bbbut why
[12:45:26] <HS^> well
[12:45:29] <NoiseEee> the helper refers to the original element
[12:45:34] <NoiseEee> when you've finished, the original element is moved
[12:45:45] <HS^> its a clone?
[12:45:50] <NoiseEee> the helper, yes iirc
[12:46:01] <Kzim> hi anyone can tell me why i can't force a the selected item in this code please ? http://dpaste.com/691088/
[12:46:02] <NoiseEee> i've wound up making my own helpers,
[12:46:09] <HS^> i did...
[12:46:14] <HS^> so here s what i want to do:
[12:46:35] <snagnever> $('#pending_box .buttons').on('click',function(e){e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;})
[12:46:40] <HS^> left side of page is like a toolbox with buttons:  right side a sortable.   i want to drag widgets from left side to rightside
[12:46:47] <HS^> so not the buttons from the toolbox
[12:46:49] <HS^> but widgets
[12:47:18] <HS^> now it will drag the widget.. (helper div)  but it will drop the button (the original draggable)
[12:47:22] <snagnever> i don't want any element inside that div to be clickable (and i have links with href and links with onclick events) but it's not preventing those with the onclick event
[12:47:26] <HS^> makes sense?
[12:47:45] <snagnever> how to?
[12:48:12] <someprimetime> yo how can i prevent this from fading out when the arrow is clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/15/
[12:48:27] <NoiseEee> HS^: so you want to drag things to the sortable, but leave the original element in place?  ie: drag the button to the sortable as many times as you want?
[12:49:03] <HS^> no i can do that
[12:49:10] <HS^> i want to drag the clone into the sortable
[12:49:27] <NoiseEee> sorry dude imma ask you to put up a fiddle
[12:49:42] <HS^> imagine a button that says "Apple" in text,  i want to drag an apple and put it in the sortable
[12:50:12] <HS^> right now i drag the apple image, but when it's dropped into the sortable it becomes the text "apple" again
[12:50:19] <NoiseEee> right...
[12:50:27] <HS^> you understand?
[12:50:44] <Zzaichik> someprimetime:  http://jsfiddle.net/DHMGD/16/
[12:50:56] <y3di> is there a way i can get .children() to select everything except a specific child?
[12:51:34] <NoiseEee> HS^: I think you'd ultimately have to use replaceWith on the drop, and replace the text "apple" with the helper
[12:51:58] <NoiseEee> HS^: and to do that, I'd have the "helper" really be a hidden element somewhere, that your draggable can use as a helper, and that your script can use as a replacement element
[12:52:04] <NoiseEee> HS^: just off the top of my head
[12:52:05] <Kzim> anyoen know why $("#select_c").val(selected_id); not working for a select please ? http://dpaste.com/691088/
[12:52:13] <someprimetime> Zzaichik: thanks *bowdown*
[12:52:22] <HS^> NoiseEee yea thats sort of what im doing. the helper is hidden
[12:52:40] <Zzaichik> someprimetime:  my pleaser. Use this one: http://jsfiddle.net/DHMGD/17/
[12:52:46] <Zzaichik> pleasure*
[12:52:52] <HS^> but in the receive method in sortable i cant get access to the droppable or helper or anything
[12:52:58] <HS^> i dont know where to replace the html
[12:53:39] <NoiseEee> HS^: i think you'd have to do the replacement on the stop() event or other applicable event
[12:53:52] <HS^> the stop of the draggable?
[12:53:57] <NoiseEee> HS^: receive maybe?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#event-stop
[12:54:47] <NoiseEee> HS^: i would say the sortable rather than draggable offhand; a draggable can stop before it ever makes it to the sorted list
[12:54:50] <HS^> the receive is called when i drop the draggable on it
[12:55:01] <HS^> but i dont know how to get access there to the droppable
[12:55:20] <jeffreylevesque> can someone help me implement / fix my thumbnails on my rotating slideshow -- when clicking the thumbnail it updates the rotating image?
[12:55:22] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/YpW3a/14/
[12:55:41] <NoiseEee> HS^: inspect the "event" and "ui" arguments of the function
[12:55:58] <HS^> when i write  receive: function(event, ui) { console.log($(ui.draggable)); }  its empty
[12:56:08] <HS^> i did theres lotttts in event
[12:56:15] <HS^> not sure whats in ui

[12:56:50] <minijupe> how would I apply this effect to the last element matched here: $("#images_list .site_section").effect("highlight", {}, 1500);
[12:56:54] <minijupe> only the last
[12:56:58] <HS^> im sort of a newbie what is supposed to be in the ui and event objects
[12:57:06] <xp_prg> is it ok to put stuff on a second row or do I need to do this \ like in python?
[12:57:22] <NoiseEee> HS^: they're mysterious, take a look in the debugger and see
[12:57:30] <minijupe> last() :
[12:57:31] <minijupe> ?
[12:58:12] <HS^> ok i think the ui. can help me,  the helper is in there
[13:01:26] <NoiseEee> HS^: also if you're a newbie, congrats on using a debugger.console and knowing how to do so.
[13:02:28] <HS^> man i love firebug, only know it couple weeks someone showed it... but it really saves me a headache
[13:06:53] <minijupe> is there a way to scroll to make sure a certain element is in the viewport?
[13:08:11] <NoiseEee> minijupe: i think there's a jquery scrollTo plugin, google for it

[13:21:26] <NoiseEee> Kzim: what does your error console say?  can you make a jsfiddle that reproduces the issue?
[13:22:29] <NoiseEee> Kzim: glancing at your code, it looks like your last line should be in the callback, no?
[13:22:50] <NoiseEee> Kzim: otherwise you're setting the value of the <select> element that hasn't completed its xhr call
[13:24:43] <Kzim> NoiseEee: no error i have to try fiddle
[13:24:49] <NoiseEee> Kzim: glancing at your code, it looks like your last line should be in the callback, no?
[13:25:06] <Kzim> i tried to but same thing
[13:25:14] <Kzim> the select value get set to null

[13:27:43] <someprimetime> sorry i didn't get a chance to check it before i stepped out
[13:27:49] <someprimetime> not sure what you're trying to do?
[13:27:52] <NoiseEee> Kzim: you're going to have to try and reproduce a jsfiddle
[13:28:00] <someprimetime> i'm just trying to prevent propgagation
[13:28:02] <someprimetime> propagation, rather
[13:28:50] <Kzim> NoiseEee: it will be hard ..
[13:29:11] <NoiseEee> Kzim: then use your console, figure out what 'data' is.  the pastes youve shown are quite different from one another.
[13:32:00] <Zzaichik> someprimetime:  ah - okay my bad.
[13:32:24] <someprimetime> no worries
[13:32:55] <kladze> How can i wait for the red div to show up first, and then the the text fade in afterwards?
[13:33:06] <kladze> http://www.sofa1.dk/site/loltest2/
[13:33:39] <kladze> its a very quick template of how i want the basic to be
[13:33:58] <HS^> NoiseEee ehm.. at when i look at the ui in receive: function(event, ui) {
[13:33:59] <Kzim> NoiseEee: look like data is a simpel string
[13:34:03] <Kzim> NoiseEee: data: "55"
[13:34:18] <HS^> it contains the original item, not the thing that is dropped
[13:34:52] <HS^> when i write this:  ui.item.html("test");  the original is changed, not the clone/helper whatever it is that is dropped
[13:35:17] <HS^> i want to change the item that is being dropped... any idea what i need to look for?
[13:37:33] <NoiseEee> HS^: what i'm saying is that you cant avoid dropping the helper.  thats the only thing you CAN drop
[13:38:31] <NoiseEee> HS^: once it IS dropped, replace the newly located element (text string "apple") with a whatever you want
[13:39:02] <NoiseEee> HS^: don't try to change the helper on the fly
[13:40:03] <kladze> How can i fade in my text after the red div has loaded? - http://www.sofa1.dk/site/loltest2/
[13:40:39] <HS^> but what even am i looking for then
[13:40:47] <HS^> receive is when the item gets dropped
[13:40:54] <HS^> event*
[13:41:43] <NoiseEee> HS^: you'll have to replace the element after its dropped.
[13:42:27] <NoiseEee> when dropped, el.replaceWith($('<p>NEW THING!</p>'))
[13:42:42] <Kzim> NoiseEee: is it possible that i want to get the value a of the select to fast after update him ? and so it don't find it ?
[13:42:53] <NoiseEee> Kzim: yes
[13:43:16] <NoiseEee> Kzim: i think, i already forget your code
[13:43:52] <HS^> NoiseEee in the stop event?
[13:43:53] <HS^> you think?
[13:44:06] <NoiseEee> i'd say the receive event
[13:44:40] <NoiseEee> HS^: a draggable can stop before it ever makes it to the sorted list
[13:44:42] <HS^> so how would i replace it... i dont have access to the element
[13:44:45] <HS^> thats my problem
[13:45:21] <HS^> in receive: function(event, ui) {  , the ui contains the helper ... which 'dissapears' after its dropped
[13:45:35] <HS^> and it contains item, which is the /original/ not the clone thats been dropped
[13:45:47] <HS^> so if i change  ui.item.replaceWith($('<p>NEW THING!</p>'))
[13:45:52] <HS^> it would change the original thing
[13:46:19] <HS^> how would i get access to the dropped element from the receive event
[13:46:30] <HS^> thats my problem
[13:47:17] <HS^> with dropped i mean the cloned item thats in the list
[13:47:26] <NoiseEee> HS^: i'd suggest using a real, hidden DOM element as the helper for your draggable. when defining your helper, make a clone of that element and use it.  when your item is dropped, replace with the origin, hidden DOM element.
[13:47:46] <HS^> yes thats what i want to do
[13:47:58] <NoiseEee> christ!
[13:48:08] <HS^> exactly that.  and im trying that.  but my problem is getting when to the item when it s dropped
[13:48:11] <HS^> the dropped item
[13:48:29] <HS^> like the clone copy
[13:48:44] <NoiseEee> helper: function(ev) { return $('hiddenElement').clone() }      receive:  whatever.replaceWith($('hiddenElement'))
[13:48:49] <NoiseEee> something along those lines ^^
[13:49:08] <NoiseEee> forget about ui.helper
[13:49:14] <HS^> i got that far...
[13:49:16] <NoiseEee> on the drop, anyways
[13:49:22] <HS^> the problem is with 'whetever.
[13:49:29] <HS^> i dont know how i get to the whatever.
[13:49:43] <NoiseEee> somewhere in event or ui is a reference to its new place.
[13:49:46] <HS^> how i refer to the dropped item
[13:50:12] <HS^> ok ill search again
[13:50:53] <Zzaichik> someprimetime: did you figure out what you wanted?
[13:52:43] <kladze> How can i fade in my text after the red div has loaded? - http://www.sofa1.dk/site/loltest2/
[13:59:01] <Zzaichik> someprimetime: is this what you were after?
[13:59:04] <Zzaichik> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/DHMGD/24/
[13:59:27] <someprimetime> Zzaichik: no
[13:59:34] <Zzaichik> dammit bobby
[13:59:34] <someprimetime> it was working previously
[13:59:49] <someprimetime> fading isn't the issue
[14:00:00] <someprimetime> it's stopping the propagation from the click of the arrow bubbling up the dom
[14:00:03] <Linex> I created a dialog with $("#dialog").dialog({title: "MyDialog",autoOpen: false}); then I do  $("a").click(function(){$dialog.dialog("open");
[14:00:17] <someprimetime> so when you click on the body, it closes the popped up .options container
[14:00:28] <Linex> everything is fine but pressing the close button on the top right of the dialog does not close the dialog.
[14:00:43] <Zzaichik> okay
[14:01:14] <Linex> this is so basic but it does not work. Do i have a scope problem here ?
[14:01:24] <Linex> or need a closure
[14:01:38] <Zzaichik> someprimetime: that's what it's doing right now.
[14:01:50] <Zzaichik> the body is only like 20px high though
[14:02:08] <kladze> How can i fade in my text after the red div has loaded? - http://www.sofa1.dk/site/loltest2/
[14:02:17] <someprimetime> Zzaichik: click on the arrow
[14:02:22] <someprimetime> the options div pops up
[14:02:27] <someprimetime> click anywhere on the body
[14:02:31] <someprimetime> (outside of the options popup)
[14:02:36] <someprimetime> it's not working
[14:03:26] <Zzaichik> I promise  you, it is. The body for that window in jsfiddle is saying it's only about 20pixels high. So if you click of to the right near the top you'll get the desired effect.
[14:04:28] <someprimetime> Zzaichik: in chrome?
[14:04:32] <Zzaichik> yeah
[14:06:02] <SP33D> how can it happen that when i have a absolut positioned div container that it don't get centered when i set margin left right to auto?
[14:08:08] <y3di> is there a way i can get .children() to select every child of an element except for a specific child?
[14:08:14] <Zzaichik> someprimetime: in here, I gave the body a specific height so it should work better. http://jsfiddle.net/DHMGD/26/

[14:15:43] <_dave_h_d> hi guys with 1.7.1 i am getting .fadeOut is not a function?
[14:15:46] <_dave_h_d> is this right?
[14:16:32] <fullsailor> _dave_h_d: fadeOut is still in the API
[14:16:48] <fullsailor> Something else must be amiss.
[14:16:59] <_dave_h_d> here is the whole line
[14:17:01] <_dave_h_d> $("#feedback_message").html(message).fadeOut is not a function
[14:18:41] <fullsailor> Seems correct. Are you using any plugins?
[14:19:11] <_dave_h_d> yes
[14:22:05] <fullsailor> Perhaps a rouge plugin is removing the fadeOut function
[14:22:20] <fullsailor> Is jQuery.fn.fadeOut a function?
[14:22:34] <fullsailor> console.log(typeof jQuery.fn.fadeOut)
[14:26:54] <_dave_h_d> fullsailor: function
[14:27:03] <_dave_h_d> that is what that comes back with
[14:27:20] <_dave_h_d> could that line be saying that $ is not a function
[14:27:21] <_dave_h_d> ?
[14:28:08] <NoiseEee> HS^: ever get it working?
[14:28:53] <sphinxxx> _dave_h_d,  do you have () at the end of fadeOut
[14:28:58] <felipe_Brz> is there any way to customize the intensity of the border radius in a jqueryui ui-corner-all widget?
[14:29:41] <NoiseEee> felipe_Brz: smart CSS no doubt
[14:29:43] <_dave_h_d> sphinxxx: fullsailor it was because i was chaining it after html function
[14:29:47] <_dave_h_d> really weird
[14:29:59] <felipe_Brz> NoiseEee: ? Smart CSS?
[14:30:04] <felipe_Brz> should I google it?
[14:30:20] <NoiseEee> felipe_Brz: just use CSS  :)
[14:30:28] <_dave_h_d> so 1.6 allows to chain and 1.7 does not
[14:30:38] <nicholasschulz> When you click the menu (Selg), is the animation laggy or fluent? http://bannaky.com/
[14:33:03] <nicholasschulz> Anyone?
[14:33:53] <_dave_h_d> i have another issue, the function "contains" keeps appending it self onto the end of my array
[14:34:03] <_dave_h_d> how do i ensure it doesn't
[14:34:10] <felipe_Brz> i did this .ui-corner-all{ border-radius:30px;} but it hasn't changed anything... should I manually make the same hacks that jquery uses to make it work on all browsers?
[14:34:50] <Zzaichik> add in !important
[14:35:00] <Zzaichik> And see if it does then,  felipe_Brz
[14:35:03] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: they're not hacks, they're vendor prefixes
[14:35:07] <ajpiano> you have to use them all, yes
[14:35:34] <felipe_Brz> !important did the trick, thanks
[14:36:04] <Zzaichik> either do it that way or go in and edit jquery.ui's stylesheet directly, felipe_Brz
[14:36:31] <felipe_Brz> Zzaichik:  ok thanks!
[14:36:45] <ajpiano> that way you can get to manually re-apply those changes *every time you update!*
[14:36:46] <ajpiano> yay!!!
[14:36:59] <Zzaichik> haha
[14:37:12] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: doing it in a separate file where you explicitly maintain the overrides will provide for a better upgrade path
[14:37:14] <Zzaichik> by that logic, just use your own stylesheet.
[14:37:57] <crankharder> how come $('foo').fadeIn().effect('bounce') doesn't do the effects simultaneously?
[14:38:03] <crankharder> ...and how do I get it to do so
[14:40:32] <thm> does someone know what happened to the jquery.ui.datetime plugin?
[14:44:45] <someprimetime> Zzaichik: thanks man
[14:45:01] <Zzaichik> someprimetime:  no problem
[14:45:24] <someprimetime> do i need to unbind something? if you try to click the arrow after closing it out, it makes you click twice
[14:45:50] <someprimetime> or preventDefault() ?
[14:45:52] <Zzaichik> Yeah I think so. the body click is whats making you have to click twice I beleive.
[14:46:05] <Zzaichik> maybe try preventDefault. Mess around with it and see what you can do.
[14:46:15] <someprimetime> word thanks
[14:58:03] <sysadmin4hire1> would one use the .keydown() if they wanted to press TAB and have it then create new elements?
[15:01:16] <someprimetime> sysadmin4hire1: yes. http://jsfiddle.net/ztnvW/
[15:03:45] <sysadmin4hire1> someprimetime: what does this look so cryptic to me?
[15:04:06] <someprimetime> sysadmin4hire1: because you probably don't understand jquery?
[15:04:10] <someprimetime> i don't know
[15:04:13] <someprimetime> want me to explain it?
[15:04:58] <someprimetime> you are adding an event listener to the body. it is checking to see if key code 9, which is equivalent to the "tab" key is pressed. if it is pressed, it appends a new element to the page
[15:05:02] <someprimetime> which is what i assume you asked for
[15:09:19] <hackeron> hey, does draggable work on mobile devices yet? - last I checked it didn't :(
[15:10:47] <sysadmin4hire1> so - pulling it apart - the first part says something about function? -- then you select the "body" element and say if a key is pressed and keycode (aka TAB key) sorry - had to step away from my desk
[15:11:53] <someprimetime> the first is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {}); i suggest you read over the jquery docs
[15:12:12] <sysadmin4hire1> and say if tab key (identified by keycode 9) ok
[15:12:28] <sysadmin4hire1> yeah - im reading through jquery in action atm.
[15:12:33] <sysadmin4hire1> just started today though... :D
[15:12:59] <someprimetime> you are attaching an event "listener" to the body which is anything that occurs within the body (everything on the page) .. so whenever a user is inside your page and presses tab, it'll trigger that function
[15:13:03] <someprimetime> the e is shorthand for event
[15:13:07] <someprimetime> both can be used interchangeably
[15:14:22] <sysadmin4hire1> ok so - if i wanted to apply it to 1 "row" of an html form (drop down box => textbox) I would put those in a <div> or i would need to identify them with a name attribute...or something like that.
[15:16:14] <dtriley41> Anyone familiar with coin slider and can help me?
[15:19:24] <someprimetime> target the append to wherever you want
[15:19:28] <someprimetime> right now it just appends it to the body
[15:21:44] <Kzim> hi
[15:22:09] <Kzim> i really can't understand why this not work http://dpaste.com/691178/ i just want to force a select ...
[15:24:35] <dtriley41> Anyone familiar with coin slider and can help me?
[15:25:27] <datadl> Kzim: why don't you use html for that ?
[15:27:45] <HS^> why does jquiry duplicate an id with draggable
[15:27:48] <HS^> and clone
[15:27:58] <HS^> i thought id's shouldnt be duplicatd
[15:28:03] <HS^> its causing me problems in ie7
[15:29:05] <Musok> hi guys
[15:29:14] <Musok> how can i do something like jQuery(this ".desc") ?
[15:29:28] <Putr> hi! I'm looking for a way to display a small error message that hides after X seconds
[15:29:43] <Putr> or more like notification message
[15:30:52] <datadl> Musok: syntax is
[15:31:04] <datadl> jQuery('.desc', this)
[15:31:08] <Musok> aaah thanks
[15:32:06] <datadl> Putr: $('.error).fadeInt().delay(5000).fadeOut();
[15:32:09] <datadl> should do the trick
[15:32:15] <datadl> fadeIn not Int
[15:32:19] <Putr> hmm good point
[15:32:19] <datadl> 5000 = 5s,
[15:32:27] <Putr> i quess i was overthinking it
[15:32:43] <datadl> correct my typing, i'm tired :)
[15:32:59] <someprimetime> what's the deal with http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/DHMGD/29/ and forcing me to double click when pressing arrow > 1 time?
[15:33:20] <Putr> thanks  datadl
[15:33:27] <someprimetime> it's a problem with the toggle()
[15:33:45] <someprimetime> i tried adding preventDefault() but that didn't seem to do the trick
[15:34:12] <datadl> if delay doesn't work, i sugget you use the plugin jquery dotimeout
[15:34:17] <datadl> works very well
[15:34:23] <datadl> (better than timeout)
[15:35:44] <datadl> someprimetime: you put event instead of e
[15:36:10] <datadl> also, no need of a $ before your vars
[15:36:55] <someprimetime> ah some guy in here changed that (not sure why)
[15:36:59] <someprimetime> and that doesn't change anything anyway
[15:37:08] <datadl> lemme try
[15:37:09] <someprimetime> also, putting $ is a good convention to follow when the variables are objects
[15:37:16] <someprimetime> opposed to integer values
[15:37:19] <someprimetime> or strings
[15:37:29] <someprimetime> it's my personal preference
[15:37:53] <Putr> hey datadl remove() is not in the que is it? i cant just add .remove() to the end of the line and remove the message
[15:38:10] <y3di> is there a way i can get .children() to select every child of an element except for a specific child?
[15:38:27] <Putr> y3di: select all, than filter out the one you dont need
[15:38:33] <Putr> i think it's .filter ?
[15:39:33] <Putr> y3di: no need. children already gives you the ability (read the documentation)
[15:41:51] <datadl> Putr: do it in the fadeout
[15:41:52] <datadl> .fadeOut(function(){$(this).remove()});
[15:42:00] <Putr> ye just reading about it
[15:42:14] <Putr> aha you have to wrap this in $(). no wonder it wasnt working
[15:42:45] <Putr> yey it works :)
[15:43:26] <datadl> :)
[15:43:47] <datadl> if you use this alone, it's a var
[15:43:55] <datadl> if you haven't define the var, it cannot work
[15:44:10] <HS^> the id is being duplicated with draggable...
[15:44:13] <HS^> why is that/
[15:45:26] <digital-ghost> Hi all. Fairly new to JQuery, but looking to make a scrollable 'breadcrumb trail' using a unordered list. I want to display 5 items at once and be able to scroll back and forth. -- Can anyone point me in the right direction of what I'd need to get started?
[15:45:59] <datadl> someprimetime: i go the click works after second try always
[15:46:00] <datadl> http://jsfiddle.net/frkr3/
[15:46:11] <datadl> don't know why its not working at first
[15:46:43] <someprimetime> ahh yeah it's cause this guy in here bound $arrow to toggle() instead of click()
[15:46:45] <someprimetime> that's way better
[15:47:09] <someprimetime> actually
[15:47:13] <someprimetime> that doesn't work at all
[15:47:14] <someprimetime> lol
[15:47:14] <datadl> but there is still an event bounded to first click
[15:47:15] <someprimetime> sorry
[15:47:37] <datadl> did you have a look at jquery ufd ?
[15:47:38] <someprimetime> it's queuing up all those clicks
[15:47:42] <someprimetime> might have  to return false
[15:47:43] <someprimetime> ufd?
[15:47:45] <datadl> http://code.google.com/p/ufd/
[15:47:52] <datadl> it's pretty good plugin
[15:48:01] <datadl> and the guys did a pretty good job handling events
[15:48:07] <datadl> seems to be what you need
[15:48:12] <someprimetime> nah sorry i don't like using plugins

[15:52:30] <someprimetime> live is deprecated though fyi

[15:52:41] <someprimetime> i had a feeling i need dot use that

[15:53:25] <datadl> i know, thats a reflex
[15:53:28] <sk8ball> http://jsfiddle.net/MKelley/ER5S7/  <--- can someone take a look at this, it should be very simple.  i want a h1 element to have a certain class styling for 6 seconds on page load, then hat syling be removed.
[15:53:40] <datadl> HS^: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7459512/duplicating-jquery-draggables
[15:53:59] <someprimetime> haha word
[15:54:20] <sk8ball> basically i want it to have the hover style of the element for the first 6 seconds, then revert back to the normal style
[15:54:44] <sk8ball> im trying to it with setTimeout and removing the class attribute assigned to it
[15:54:55] <sk8ball> but it never seems to have that styling
[15:55:24] <sk8ball> i tried doing it in jsFiddle even just to ensure some other styling wasnt taking precedence
[15:56:49] <datadl> sk8ball: remove window.
[15:56:53] <datadl> before the setTimeout
[15:56:56] <datadl> shoudld do the trick
[15:57:01] <datadl> setTimeout(function() {
[15:57:01] <datadl>    $('#headone').removeAttr('class');
[15:57:01] <datadl>  }, 6000);

[16:00:39] <Hiall> Wanting some advice, I have a dropdown menu that appears on clicking a little arrow and obviously if its open i can toggle close. However if its open is there a good way to allow for clicking *anywhere* else and using the esc key to close it? I was thinking of using .live() but this seems slightly heavy on the resources. Are there any better alternatives?
[16:01:45] <sk8ball> ahhh so there was two problems
[16:01:47] <sk8ball> the window
[16:02:04] <sk8ball> and just using the class litup
[16:02:19] <sk8ball> like:  .litup { }
[16:02:29] <sk8ball> didnt seem to change the style
[16:02:32] <Hiall> sk8ball: would this not need a live event to be used though?
[16:02:35] <sk8ball> i had to do #id.class
[16:02:41] <Hiall> nm! :D

[16:38:34] <o]> Eviltwin: does add put on the end too?
[16:38:45] <o]> they look the same for me
[16:39:25] <KWhat_Work> Ehh, i think i am just going to rewrite the class
[16:41:09] <Eviltwin> o]: They are not the same
[16:41:16] <o]> can you elaborate, please?
[16:41:21] <o]> the documentation does not make it clear
[16:43:58] <o]> Eviltwin: explain to me, please
[16:46:27] <Eviltwin> o]: The documentation makes it blindingly clear
[16:46:51] <o]> that's the part I can't figure out
[16:47:02] <o]> both pages say it adds the elements
[16:47:24] <o]> just tell me the difference and you will make a man happy
[16:47:28] <Eviltwin> You need to actually read them
[16:47:38] <Eviltwin> We're not here to answer questions answered by the documentation
[16:47:40] <o]> and understand the hidden details
[16:47:41] <o]> :-/
[16:47:59] <o]> why you are here? this channel is dead
[16:48:09] <Giverny> lol
[16:48:13] <Eviltwin> You can leave if you want
[16:48:26] <Giverny> o] is a just troll
[16:48:31] <o]> wrong
[16:48:37] <o]> I really wanna know the difference
[16:48:49] <o]> and it is not bad being nice on IRC
[16:48:50] <Eviltwin> Look at the examples on that page
[16:49:00] <Eviltwin> And you'll see the difference
[16:49:09] <Eviltwin> Unless you've never done any jQuery before
[16:49:14] <Eviltwin> In which case you need to see ?learn
[16:49:14] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[16:49:28] <o]> I know being nice is old fashioned on the internets. I am just an old man that has hope
[16:50:04] <nicholasschulz> When using $('#someDiv').prepend('Sometext'); you just add text to the div Is there a way to add AND REPLACE all the content of the div?
[16:50:09] <Giverny> o] what u want?
[16:50:25] <o]> Giverny: understand the difference between add() and append()
[16:50:43] <Blaster> hey guys, could anyone help me with this small bit of AJAX?
[16:50:44] <Blaster> http://pastebin.com/b1xQ3mZh
[16:50:45] <Giverny> api.jquery.com/add
[16:50:47] <Giverny> api.jquery.com/append
[16:50:51] <o]> :)
[16:50:59] <Blaster> I'm trying to get a data response in JSON but it says undefined
[16:51:21] <Giverny> add : Description: Add elements to the set of matched elements.
[16:51:29] <o]> append does that too
[16:51:33] <Blaster> and the page echoes {'message':'testing}
[16:51:45] <Giverny> append: Description: Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements.
[16:51:59] <Giverny> you can see the diference?
[16:52:00] <o]> what is the diff between 'add' and ' insert to the end'  ?
[16:52:03] <o]> I cant see
[16:52:22] <dabear_> nicholasschulz: do an .empty()
[16:52:32] <nicholasschulz> ok
[16:52:32] <Eviltwin> o]: First example for add, tell me what's happening
[16:52:38] <Eviltwin> Walk me through it
[16:52:55] <o]> $('#mydiv').add(elem)   $('#mydiv').append(elem)    will do the same thing if elem is a <p>
[16:53:07] <Eviltwin> No, they won't
[16:53:14] <o]> o__O
[16:53:18] <Eviltwin> They won't do close to the same thing
[16:53:39] <o]> why?
[16:53:59] <Giverny> o] is just a troll
[16:54:12] <o]> please, stop accusing me
[16:54:24] <o]> so, what is the diff?
[16:54:36] <Eviltwin> They do completely different things, that's the difference
[16:54:38] <Giverny> Append: Appends a jQuery object (similar to an Array of DOM Elements) to all paragraphs.
[16:54:40] <Eviltwin> Don't go by the name
[16:54:42] <Eviltwin> Look at the examples
[16:55:06] <o]> ok
[16:55:18] <Giverny> add: Adds one or more Elements to the set of matched elements.
[16:55:27] <Giverny> can you see o]
[16:55:28] <Giverny> ?
[16:55:40] <Eviltwin> Giverny: He needs to learn to read documentation
[16:55:45] <Giverny> yes
[16:56:25] <o]> so add is multiple and append is single?
[16:56:45] <Giverny> lol
[16:56:49] <Eviltwin> Where the hell are you getting this from?
[16:57:11] <Giverny> o] you understand array and object?
[16:57:21] <o]> yes
[16:57:27] <Giverny> o] understand element?
[16:57:33] <o]> dom element?
[16:57:55] <Giverny> yes or not?
[16:58:03] <o]> if element is dom element, then yes
[16:58:19] <Giverny> then..
[16:58:45] <Giverny> o] wich your problem?!
[16:59:04] <nicholasschulz> did u get ur problem solved @ blaster
[16:59:55] <o]> I already told my problem. you could just tell me what I am asking, instead of being mean
[17:01:00] <o]> so, what is the diff?
[17:01:23] <dabear_> o]: add adds to the jquery collection so that you can manipulate more elements at the same time. .append just takes one element and adds more content to it
[17:01:36] <o]> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[17:01:57] <dabear_> btw, the docs tell you this
[17:02:06] <dabear_> see ?append
[17:02:06] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[17:02:13] <Giverny> in the doc have examples
[17:02:13] <dabear_> see ?add
[17:02:14] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[17:02:15] <Giverny> and more
[17:02:26] <o]> gotcha! thanks a lot, dabear_ - and I am being honest that I could not figure out these details (jquery collection and manipulating more at same time)
[17:02:51] <Giverny> u can learn all about jquery in the docs
[17:02:55] <o]> the doc examples are confusing (for the new learners)
[17:03:01] <o]> no, the docs are terse sometimes
[17:03:01] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ o]
[17:03:03] <bot-t> o], First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[17:03:10] <Eviltwin> Read that second link
[17:03:11] <dabear_> yep
[17:03:26] <xp_prg> I have a weird question lets say I have a table with id='mytableid' how do I get all the text in the second column for all rows into an array with one jquery selector call?
[17:03:27] <dabear_> I did not find them difficult when I started with jquery
[17:03:56] <dabear_> unless you just skimmed through them
[17:04:08] <o]> sure I will read, but I was wondering why getting so pissed off with a newbie when the channel is dead? shouldn't IRC be supposed to be a place for CHAT?
[17:04:23] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: You can't directly
[17:04:34] <xp_prg> I have to use .each?
[17:04:41] <Eviltwin> Or a .map
[17:04:42] <xp_prg> I hate that, I thought a selector would do it!!!
[17:04:48] <Eviltwin> ...
[17:04:51] <o]> you spent more time bragging about the documentation than telling me the answer, like dabear_ did in just one line
[17:05:25] <xp_prg> oj, are you Indian?
[17:05:26] <Eviltwin> o]: The problem is that there are resources available for you to learn all of this without wasting our time
[17:05:31] <dabear_> o]: this is at all not dead. and no, we aren't here to answer questions that can be googled easily
[17:05:32] <o]> http://www.itproportal.com/2010/02/03/the-internet-will-make-you-miserable/
[17:05:37] <Giverny> xp_prg lolllllllllll
[17:05:50] <Eviltwin> And everyone needs to learn to use documentation
[17:06:14] * xp_prg hearts everyone in here who helps him even if they are rude to him :>
[17:06:31] <xp_prg> I guess I have no pride left :>
[17:06:34] <o]> but it is nice having a good conversation and still pointing to a documentation
[17:06:59] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: You might be able to do $("#mytableid tr td:nth-child(2)")
[17:07:16] <dabear_> a good conversation implies both sides of a conversation actually benefits from the contents of the conversation
[17:07:19] <dabear_> I did not
[17:07:29] <dabear_> I'm just bored, so I answered anyway:)
[17:07:36] <o]> so you had a benefit
[17:07:56] <Eviltwin> o]: If every newbie came here for questions that simple, this channel would be overrun and no one would be able to get help
[17:08:00] <someprimetime> this chosen library is so idiotic
[17:08:04] <o]> and according to your logic, you'll never answer any question unless someone pays you
[17:08:06] <Giverny> you don`t need anything beyond the documentation
[17:08:11] <someprimetime> i mean it's nice looking, but man is it flaky
[17:08:15] <someprimetime> flakey(sp?)
[17:08:17] <snover> gentlemen.
[17:08:22] <o]> so let's talk about videogames or movies
[17:08:23] <Eviltwin> Yes, it's easier for people to learn by having something explained to them with Q & A
[17:08:25] <xp_prg> oj are you an Indian?!!!
[17:08:31] <someprimetime> o]: he answered your question
[17:08:36] <someprimetime> just rtfm
[17:08:47] <someprimetime> reading two entries for add() and append() takes < 10 min
[17:08:50] <someprimetime> hell < 5 min
[17:08:55] <dabear_> so how's the weather guys?
[17:08:55] <Eviltwin> But eventually you need to start paying people for that or learn to read a manual
[17:08:58] <dabear_> chilling here
[17:09:06] <dabear_> ?weather
[17:09:08] <someprimetime> it sucks here
[17:09:08] <bot-t> dabear_, Oslo, Oslo - Weather: Cloudy, -8C / 18F

[17:09:11] <bot-t> someprimetime, Google Time/Weather Information - ? weather <City/State Name|Code>
[17:09:14] <Giverny> before asking searching on google or documentation
[17:09:15] <o]> or talking to someone that is not miserable
[17:09:18] <Giverny> before asking searching on google or documentation
[17:09:19] <someprimetime> ?weather 94611
[17:09:19] <Giverny> before asking searching on google or documentation
[17:09:20] <nicholasschulz> is there an equivalent of PHP's is_int in JS ?
[17:09:20] <bot-t> someprimetime, Oakland, CA - Weather: Light rain, 12C / 54F
[17:09:26] <someprimetime> actually i'm in SF
[17:09:30] <someprimetime> ?weather san francisco
[17:09:31] <bot-t> someprimetime, San Francisco, CA - Weather: Light rain, 14C / 57F
[17:09:39] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: jQuery has isNumeric or something
[17:09:59] <someprimetime> why not use isNaN?
[17:10:27] <someprimetime> or would you have to wrap the var in parseInt() first before checking if isNaN?
[17:10:29] <nicholasschulz> eviltwin ok
[17:10:31] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: Typically it's done by parsing and seeing whether or not the result is NaN
[17:10:46] <nicholasschulz> ok
[17:12:34] <xp_prg> oj how old are you?
[17:12:52] <dabear_> ?eval !isNaN("  ")
[17:12:53] <bot-t> dabear_: true
[17:13:30] <dabear_> someprimetime: emptyspace would make the isNan check think its really a number:p
[17:13:59] <someprimetime> ?eval isNaN("parseInt('  ')")
[17:14:00] <bot-t> someprimetime: true
[17:14:02] <dabear_> therefore, use !isNaN( parseFloat(obj) ) && isFinite( obj );
[17:14:04] <someprimetime> oh wtf
[17:14:21] <dabear_> a strign is not a number
[17:14:27] <someprimetime> ?eval !isNaN("parseInt('  ')")
[17:14:27] <dabear_> so that one is correct
[17:14:27] <bot-t> someprimetime: false
[17:14:31] <someprimetime> there we go
[17:14:33] <nicholasschulz> dabear_ er du norsk :-p?
[17:14:39] <dabear_> jau
[17:14:41] <dabear_> stemmer
[17:14:45] <nicholasschulz> hehe ok
[17:14:48] <nicholasschulz> oslo?
[17:14:57] <dabear_> nope, trondheim
[17:15:03] <nicholasschulz> Ok.
[17:26:12] <dabear_> hah
[17:26:17] <dabear_> just discovered something
[17:26:18] <dabear_> http://jsfiddle.net/AxqsX/
[17:26:24] <dabear_> that totally breaks
[17:26:32] <dabear_> just because of the tag name
[17:31:30] <Giverny> i like jsfiddle
[17:32:44] <oxez> hello. is there a way to do something like this: Select all elements that are not in a defined array, like this: $("selector").notIn(myArray) ? (my array would contain jquery objects of course)
[17:33:29] <Eviltwin> oxez: You can't not against an array of jQuery objects because that is actually technically an array of arrays
[17:33:40] <Eviltwin> And the jQuery utils only support one level of arrays
[17:33:54] <Giverny> you can use inArray()
[17:34:02] <Giverny> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[17:34:10] <Eviltwin> Not sure how that helps him
[17:34:33] <oxez> hmm
[17:34:36] <RedFox2> hey
[17:34:48] <millermedeiros> you can use the .not(elements) to filter out what you need: http://jqapi.com/#p=not
[17:35:22] <RedFox2> I have an url list in an array and I want to iterate through it and do a $.get but the loop should wait until it gets success or error state before continue fetching other urls - how can this be done? ;)
[17:35:33] <RedFox2> (it should be blocking)
[17:35:47] <RedFox2> (request after request)
[17:35:55] <oxez> millermedeiros: Yeah, I could build a string of ids fromy my array, and use that
[17:36:05] <Eviltwin> AJAX isn't blocking
[17:36:17] <RedFox2> Eviltwin, let me show a code ok?
[17:36:19] <dabear_> oxez: no, it should be dom elements
[17:36:39] <oxez> dabear_: they are
[17:36:43] <millermedeiros> oxez: no need to create an array of ids.. can be arbitrary elements. one sec.
[17:37:06] <RedFox2> Eviltwin: http://www.pastie.org/private/voghemk9kenhk9nwuiwg
[17:37:07] <Eviltwin> Do you mean serially?
[17:37:33] <Eviltwin> Or they happen in parallel and once ALL of them are done, do something
[17:38:03] <RedFox2> they happen in parallel... I'd like ajax to do the request and then it should proceed if it gets success or error back
[17:39:42] <dabear_> RedFox2: you can use $.when($.ajax(...), $.ajax(...)).then( function(retval1,retval2){  all successfully here})
[17:40:01] <RedFox2> and for some reason it does not print the proper theid value
[17:40:30] <dabear_> hehe, scope issues
[17:41:04] <RedFox2> not really.... the request is done correctly
[17:41:11] <RedFox2> but then it fucks up because it's not blockable
[17:41:11] <dabear_> oh yeah
[17:41:15] <dabear_> you have scope issues
[17:41:43] <dabear_> theid will always point to the *last* iterations id
[17:41:43] <RedFox2> the problem is: I expect $.get to be blockable but it's non blockable now
[17:42:04] <RedFox2> yes, and it does just call $.get and jquery does chain it somehow and therefore the id is never correct
[17:42:16] <dabear_> no,no
[17:42:22] <dabear_> this is no jquery issue
[17:43:04] <millermedeiros> oxez: check this out (quick and dirty) http://jsfiddle.net/TTfkT/
[17:43:29] <dabear_> RedFox2: use $.each instead of a for
[17:43:34] <dabear_> and your problem is solved
[17:43:42] <RedFox2> whats the difference?
[17:44:30] <oxez> millermedeiros: that's very interesting, thank you very much
[17:45:24] <dabear_> RedFox2: .each creates an inner scope that is preserved for the ajax callback
[17:45:47] <dabear_> RedFox2: alternatively this will do the same: http://jsfiddle.net/Juhfc/
[17:47:21] <RedFox2> kind of true what you say... it works... great - thanks dabear_ !
[17:48:10] <dabear_> RedFox2: basically, the for loop is finished running before the successhandlers are run
[17:48:44] <RedFox2> yes but the context is this time correct because of $.each
[17:48:46] <dabear_> so when the success handlers are called, all they see, is the same value for "idx"
[17:49:09] <dabear_> and theid as well
[17:50:31] <RedFox2> ok ;) got it
[17:50:33] <RedFox2> thx
[17:50:50] <RedFox2> I need a strstr now
[17:50:56] <RedFox2> indexOf it's called I think
[17:50:59] <dabear_> RedFox2: basically, this is your issue
[17:51:01] <dabear_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1651618/javascript-jquery-variable-scope-issue
[17:53:23] <wiwillia> Can I stop event bubbling with javascript to allow a checkbox to work inside an element which, when clicked, also toggles that checkbox?  Here's my code: www.voostmedia.com/discoverly <- currently bubbles out toggling the checkbox twice.
[17:59:28] <dabear_> ?stoppropagation @ wiwillia
[17:59:28] <bot-t> wiwillia, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[18:01:56] <wiwillia> thank you dabear
[18:29:11] <aca20031> http://pastebin.com/mnYMww4Z Please dear god tell me why this is enough to have IE9 make the item completely disappear?
[18:31:48] <aca20031> nvm that
[18:36:39] <Nikhil_> how can i jquery as browser compatibility issues?
[18:36:49] <Nikhil_> how can i use jquery as browser compatibility issues?
[18:49:02] <dilvie> Nikhil_: I don't understand the question. Just use jQuery and you won't have to worry about browser compatibility issues for anything that jQuery implements, because jQuery abstracts those issues away from you.
[19:08:29] <JoeyA> Say I have var span=$('<span></span>'); ...  What's a good way to empty a node, then put span in it?  I could say $('#target').empty().append(span), but will $('#target').html(span) work just as well?
[19:09:10] <JoeyA> That is, replace the inner HTML of a DOM node with a constructed DOM node.
[19:12:06] <dilvie> .html works fine, but you don't need a jQuery object to do that.. '<span></span>' can just be a string.
[19:13:56] <LukeNukem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MiI4xAaw0c
[19:13:57] <JoeyA> dilvie: Thanks.  I'm appending stuff to the span.
[19:14:27] <dilvie> .empty().append(span)
[19:14:55] <JoeyA> That's what I said originally.
[19:14:57] <wiwillia> Hi - is there a way to get siblings() that are in a different td?  or should I use parent('td').children(input:checkbox).removeAttr('checked');
[19:15:06] <dilvie> I like to name my jQuery objects with $ at the beginning... I know it's a little hungarian-notation-ish, but I like to know that I'm dealing with a jQuery object at a glance.
[19:15:07] <JoeyA> I'm asking if it's okay to use .html on a constructed DOM node.
[19:15:37] <JoeyA> dilvie: Sounds like a good idea.
[19:15:54] <JoeyA> Though it might be a tad confusing when there's a bunch of PHP on the same page ;-)
[19:16:38] <JoeyA> So is it safe to say $('#target').html($node) ?
[19:17:15] <dilvie> Joey: it is safe, but internally, jquery just calls .empty().append()
[19:18:01] <dilvie> and it's the last check.. so maybe I wouldn't do that inside a large loop, because you'll introduce a function call and a couple checks to arrive at exactly the same result. =)
[19:18:46] <dilvie> if you find it more readable, and you're not looping over thousands of values, go for it.
[19:20:07] <wiwillia> Anyone have any idea?
[19:20:23] <JoeyA> dilvie: Thanks
[19:20:25] <dilvie> wiwillia: if they're in a different td, they're not siblings. they're cousins.
[19:20:33] <dilvie> sadly, I don't think there's a .cousins()
[19:20:35] <dilvie> ;)
[19:20:54] <wiwillia> dilvie if only haha
[19:21:11] <wiwillia> dilvie so I have to do some complicated parent().siblings().children() thing?
[19:21:41] <dilvie> wiwillia: yeah, but you could make a .cousins() plugin if you do it a lot. ;)
[19:21:53] <wiwillia> dilvie haha alright, thanks
[19:22:29] <dilvie> wiwillia: Actually, I really hate walking all over the DOM to find what I'm looking for. If you can alter the markup, it might be a better idea to give them all a class.
[19:23:17] <dilvie> then you can just grab them all with something like $('.extendedFam'); and have a little reunion.
[19:23:29] <dilvie> it'll also be a LOT faster.
[19:24:56] <dilvie> and your code won't break if some of those cousins get .wrap() 'd or shifted around in the dom tree.
[19:25:52] <wiwillia> dilvie yeah - how do I exclude the currently pressed element though?
[19:26:05] <wiwillia> so that it unchecks all elements except the currently selected item
[19:26:35] <wiwillia> could I do a where(name != $(this).attr('name')
[19:26:44] <wiwillia> minus incorrect where syntax
[19:27:04] <dilvie> you could uncheck first, and then check the one that's selected. =)
[19:27:11] <dilvie> that's the common solution, anyway. =)
[19:27:37] <csalvato> Hey all, I am having a problem understanding $.post()
[19:27:46] <wiwillia> dilvie okay - thanks
[19:27:52] <dilvie> no problem.
[19:28:00] <csalvato> i put this into my console of Chrome: $.post('', function(statusText) { alert(statusText);})
[19:28:07] <csalvato> i expect the result to produce an alert with the status text
[19:28:22] <csalvato> but instead, i get an alert with the responseText
[19:28:32] <csalvato> i feel like i just dont understand a fundamental concept -- can anyone help?
[19:30:28] <csalvato> can anyone help?  it is a basic jQuery example and i just dont get it
[19:30:56] <StevenCodes22> csalvato:  Thats cause the '' is the variables your posting and function(statusText) is the repsonse
[19:31:00] <dilvie> csalvato: I don't understand why you expect to get anything when you call $.post() with no uri param
[19:31:10] <csalvato> er dilvie that isn't what chrome tells me
[19:31:27] <csalvato> chrome shows that it returns a statusText of "OK"
[19:31:36] <StevenCodes22> dilvie:  pretty suree itll psot to the page its on
[19:31:51] <csalvato> but it is outputting into the alert box what is returned in the responseText variable
[19:31:56] <csalvato> put it in your chrome or FF and you will see dilvie
[19:32:24] <csalvato> when you put '' it posts to the current page
[19:32:29] <dilvie> the signature for $.post() is $.post(url[,data] [,success(data, textStatus, jqXHR][, dataType)
[19:32:47] <csalvato>  do it in your chrome, you will see dilvie -- i can put index.php as well if u like, its the same result
[19:33:16] <csalvato> it will always respond with the output of the .php file in the first variable, but not the status text
[19:33:48] <csalvato> ^^ i mean the responseText of the .php file, not the the output
[19:33:53] <dilvie> StevenCodes22: oh, I wasn't aware of that.That's not a documented feature.
[19:34:21] <csalvato> dilvie or StevenCodes222: any help on my particular issue?  I don't know what i am doing wrong, following the docs to a tee
[19:36:17] <whoever_> ls
[19:36:20] <dilvie> csalvato: I don't understand the issue. You should get the response on the first parameter of the success call, status on the second, and the XHR on the third.
[19:36:22] <StevenCodes22> dilvie:  more of a bug
[19:36:36] <csalvato> dude omg
[19:36:40] <csalvato> do this then...
[19:37:03] <csalvato> $.post("test.php", function(data) {
[19:37:03] <csalvato>    alert("Data Loaded: " + data);
[19:37:03] <csalvato>  });
[19:37:09] <csalvato> this is from their website - right in the examples
[19:37:25] <csalvato> it SHOULD spit out the value of data - its instead spitting out the value of responseText
[19:37:31] <StevenCodes22> csalvato:  DONT POST CODE IN ROOM
[19:37:50] <csalvato> http://pastebin.com/XpcxRu8T
[19:38:10] <dilvie> csalvato: also paste the response, and the header from your network tab
[19:40:59] <dilvie> csalvato: unless I misunderstand you, it sounds like you expect it to echo back what you pass in. $.post() doesn't do that. It returns back the response from the server.
[19:41:29] <csalvato> dilvie: no, i expect it to spit out the statusText, which Chrome is telling me is "OK"
[19:41:30] <csalvato> sec
[19:41:44] <destryalhmns> all of the irc channels are about programming, at 10:40pm EST on a Friday night - after a day of (probably) programming
[19:42:27] <dilvie> csalvato: try $.post(, function(data, statusText) { alert(statusText);})
[19:42:56] <dilvie> status is the SECOND parameter, not the FIRST
[19:43:06] <destryalhmns> ? i have a complaint. the .closest function says it moves up the dom tree but when i think of moving UP the dom tree i think of its order in the text file, not the order in a logical tree
[19:43:08] <dilvie> As I have already told you. ^^
[19:43:08] <bot-t> destryalhmns, .wrap() - Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[19:43:36] <csalvato> dilvie it outputs "succss" but i the status Text reads OK
[19:43:50] <dilvie> destryalhmns: That's a silly complaint. the DOM is a tree, not a scroll. =)
[19:44:02] <destryalhmns> lol
[19:44:09] <destryalhmns> i spent like an hour on it today
[19:44:24] <csalvato> i see, statusText is jQuery defined -- I am just a little lost on how this whole POST and AJAX stuff works i guess
[19:45:04] <destryalhmns> .parents() seems to give the dynamic dom while .parent().parent() seems to give the initial dom..... does that make sense? i had classes applied onmouse over and only .parents() was showing them
[19:45:11] <dilvie> csalvato: sounds like you're a little confused about how parameters are passed into callback functions.
[19:45:40] <destryalhmns> *.parents().eq(a billion)
[19:46:03] <donCams> is it possible to get the page source using javascript?
[19:46:09] <donCams> i mean the html
[19:46:18] <joshsmith> donCams: yo dude!
[19:46:23] <donCams> hey
[19:46:27] <destryalhmns> $(document).html();??
[19:46:29] <joshsmith> how's it going
[19:46:33] <dilvie> destryalhmns: parent is not the line above in the HTML text, it's the node parent in the DOM tree. If your files are indented properly, it's the first element above and indented one stop to the left.
[19:46:35] <joshsmith> destryalhmns++
[19:46:35] <donCams> just ok...
[19:46:52] <destryalhmns> yes i know, i learned that lesson the hard way
[19:46:52] <donCams> really? i tried it out... gonna try it again
[19:47:23] <csalvato> dilvie - yes that was my confusion - i apologize for getting a bit frustrated in channel
[19:48:05] <donCams> i get null, apparently
[19:49:02] * destryalhmns joshsmith++
[19:49:51] <joshsmith> donCams: you could do $('html').html()
[19:50:24] <donCams> yeah. i just tried that now and it worked
[19:50:25] <donCams> hehehe
[19:50:41] <joshsmith> whatchu been up to donCams, other than screen scraping
[19:51:36] <donCams> ah... i'm done with screen scraping/seo
[19:53:19] <destryalhmns> whats screen scraping?
[19:53:33] <destryalhmns> sounds illegal..
[19:53:47] <donCams> nope...
[19:54:07] <donCams> just checking if keywords exist in sites
[19:54:10] <donCams> not actually scraping
[19:54:21] * destryalhmns nods in approval
[19:54:38] <destryalhmns> isnt that exactly what scraping is?
[19:54:42] <joshsmith> I have actually done full on scraping
[19:54:55] <joshsmith> for cash money
[19:54:58] <joshsmith> because I'm a badass
[19:55:06] <tw2113> *looks out*
[19:55:08] * destryalhmns joshsmith++
[19:55:29] <donCams> what's illegal is scraping content then posting it in another site and getting money out of ads :)
[19:55:34] <destryalhmns> that sounds like a sweet gig
[19:56:12] <destryalhmns> how do you parse out your urls?
[19:56:46] <joshsmith> how do you mean
[19:56:53] <donCams> which reminds me. i need to study Perl :)
[19:57:00] <destryalhmns> like you can use a regular expression..
[19:57:04] <joshsmith> NO!
[19:57:13] <joshsmith> regex is bad bad bad for parsing HTML
[19:57:31] <donCams> php has DOMDocument, i use that
[19:57:38] <destryalhmns> so iv'e heard
[19:57:47] <donCams> but php's slow for scraping :)
[19:57:51] <joshsmith> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454
[19:57:57] <destryalhmns> but if its at least partially malformed xml you cant use a browsers xml parser
[19:58:36] <destryalhmns> lol seen that one
[19:58:50] <destryalhmns> imagine......
[20:00:00] <destryalhmns> you have a huge combination of iframe all with their own javascript content. you have to convert them into divs or objects on the client side. so your goal is to parse all that xml BUT the browsers xml parser says it is malformed... now what? ... regex, right?
[20:01:07] <destryalhmns> ...maybe that was a tangent
[20:01:20] <joshsmith> you can be tangent to my curves any day, bro
[20:01:35] * joshsmith is brogramming hard atm
[20:10:09] <destryalhmns> ..so is anyone else rocking out to bon jovi?
[20:12:26] <joshsmith> destryalhmns: my mom bought me a bon jovi CD once
[20:13:40] <destryalhmns> well then you had a cool mom..
[20:14:53] <joshsmith> I did, actually
[20:15:18] <destryalhmns> did she know jquery ? still cool : shes NOTHING!
[20:15:43] <destryalhmns> lol sorry
[20:17:11] <joshsmith> hahahah
[20:17:26] <joshsmith> ternary ftw
[20:17:38] <joshsmith> wow, we are TOO nerdy
[20:17:51] * joshsmith mumbles something about there being no such thing

[20:29:41] <donCams> detached element?
[20:29:47] <joshsmith> donCams: http://coder.ly
[20:30:18] <donCams> i'm neither a coder nor a company... where do I sign up?
[20:30:28] <AnarchoTroll> donCams, yes, an element that hasn't yet been attached to the dom
[20:31:02] <donCams> oh... use jQuery('element').on(); i would use jQuery('element').live(); but that's deprecated
[20:31:27] <joshsmith> donCams: haha, I forgot you do no coding at all
[20:31:33] <AnarchoTroll> donCams, what is on supposed to do?
[20:31:35] <donCams> $('#yourElementId').on('click', function() {});
[20:31:45] <donCams> yes. i don't code
[20:31:49] <donCams> i write poetry
[20:31:52] <AnarchoTroll> donCams, lol
[20:32:26] <donCams> jk... i'm still too noob to be saying that stuff
[20:32:40] <joshsmith> haha, as am I
[20:32:42] <joshsmith> I'm hella noob
[20:34:38] <tash> syntax-wise, does it look like there is anything wrong with this? http://pastie.org/3222956
[20:34:52] <joshsmith> someone here us is using Firefox 11.0.NaN on Linux
[20:34:55] <joshsmith> hahah
[20:35:12] <AnarchoTroll> donCams, the jquery I am coding against havent yet been upgraded to 1.7. We are still on 1.5 =\
[20:35:14] <joshsmith> JS fail, Olark. JS fail
[20:35:31] <tw2113> 11.0a2 (2012-01-20)
[20:35:33] <joshsmith> AnarchoTroll: sadtimes, man. I love .on syntax
[20:35:38] <tw2113> Aurora yo
[20:35:49] <joshsmith> tw2113: Olark needs to fix their code
[20:35:56] <tw2113> fedora 15
[20:35:58] <joshsmith> I am too lazy to bug report
[20:36:18] <AnarchoTroll> is there anything I can do to get rid of this annoying error? I am about to try catch it, lol
[20:37:50] <tash> my alert isn't happening when I click my button ... can someone look at my pastie and tell me if there is an obvious typo?
[20:37:53] <tash> ^^
[20:38:45] <smplstk> tash: try $( '#edit-invitems' )
[20:39:00] <joshsmith> haha yep
[20:39:24] <tash> well, there are several buttons on the page ... each with an id like this: id="edit-invitems-12734"
[20:39:36] <tash> so, was trying to get something to popup when id starts with edit-invitems
[20:39:37] <joshsmith> invitems?
[20:39:59] <joshsmith> what is in an "invitem"
[20:40:08] <tash> inventory item
[20:40:18] <tash> could be any id though really
[20:40:24] <joshsmith> ahh that is such a bad naming convention
[20:40:27] <smplstk> tash: also, you've got some syntax errors on that $function()
[20:40:29] <smplstk> missing );
[20:40:36] <joshsmith> yeah that was the other thing
[20:40:52] <tash> i can change the naming convention....its old code I inherited
[20:41:03] <joshsmith> please do, for your own sanity
[20:41:15] <tash> and, I'm also kind of new to js/jq
[20:41:22] <tash> so, syntax problems aren't easy for me to spot  yet
[20:41:23] <joshsmith> oversimplifying names is just a bad idea in general
[20:41:44] <tash> so, where am I missing a ); ?
[20:41:54] <smplstk> here tash: http://jsfiddle.net/jzLYM/1/
[20:41:57] <joshsmith> at the end of the $function(), I believe
[20:42:00] <smplstk> jsfiddle, for a better tomorrow
[20:42:14] <joshsmith> smplstk++
[20:42:32] <joshsmith> anyone here on the west coast?
[20:42:43] <daveyjoe> Can anybody figure out why chaining and caching elements seems to make this benchmark slower (in Chrome at least)?: http://jsperf.com/testing-different-ways-of-doing-a-tabbed-interface-in-j/3
[20:42:49] <joshsmith> of, like, Amurca
[20:45:23] <tash> something still ain't right, I'm going to install firebug
[20:45:45] <joshsmith> just use Chrome
[20:46:21] <tash> so, does function() always need a ); at the end?  That's odd to me...I do some php stuff and would be like function blah() { // code }
[20:54:07] <joshsmith> tash: no
[20:54:43] <joshsmith> but something that's like $('.element').on('click', function() { ...} would need that final );
[20:55:00] <joshsmith> better use of whitespace would make that clearer
[21:01:04] <tash> joshsmith: thanks, got it
[21:01:27] <tash> now at least I got my alert and consol.log working so I can try to do what I want now :P
[21:01:37] <joshsmith> do console.log() over alert
[21:01:42] <tash> k
[21:01:48] <joshsmith> also, pro-tip: you can comma separate values in console.log()
[21:02:11] <tash> console.log ( var1, var2 ); ?
[21:02:14] <joshsmith> console.log('hi', 'I', 'am', 'joshsmith') // outputs: "hi I am joshsmith"
[21:02:20] <tash> ok, cook
[21:02:31] <tash> cool
[21:03:00] <tash> my goal is to get a pre-defined form to display when I click that button.
[21:03:17] <tash> I at least know the click even is working ... now I just need to get the form situation handled
[21:03:40] <destryalhmns> css?
[21:05:04] <destryalhmns> $("#mybutton").bind("click", function(){$("#myForm").css("visibility", "visible");});
[21:05:23] <destryalhmns> or display:none|static
[21:06:39] <tash> hmm, interesting ... idk what to try. I was looking at the jquery ui modal form example here and thought that looked nice .. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal-form.html
[21:08:28] <joshsmith> destryalhmns: did you get an Internal Server Error from me before?
[21:08:46] <destryalhmns> i never tried your ip
[21:09:02] <destryalhmns> at least tonight, unless i know you from somewhere else
[21:10:19] <joshsmith> oh I wasn't sure if you had gone to coder.ly, too, or not
[21:10:34] <destryalhmns> hold on, ill try
[21:10:48] <destryalhmns> http://coder.ly
[21:11:17] <destryalhmns> worked
[21:11:30] <destryalhmns> i didnt sign in cause i dont like linkedin having my info
[21:11:46] <destryalhmns> site looks very professional btw
[21:11:48] <destryalhmns> gj
[21:14:08] <csalvato> I am having a problem undertstanding how $.ajax() works http://pastebin.com/2YyYDqvQ
[21:14:31] <csalvato> i thought by declaring success in th $.ajax() call, it should overwrite that callback function, but it doesnt seem to be doing that
[21:15:41] <csalvato> any takers?
[21:18:29] <destryalhmns> ill take the question
[21:18:34] <destryalhmns> override the callback function?
[21:18:41] <destryalhmns> what you declare is the callback function
[21:18:48] <destryalhmns> ...for success
[21:19:17] <destryalhmns> maybe your not just successful pal *poke
[21:19:43] <destryalhmns> there is also, i think its called .complete
[21:19:53] <destryalhmns> which you can give an alert to
[21:21:30] <tash> destryalhmns:: the code you recommened earlier, with this in it: $("#dialog-popup").css("visibility", "visible"); .... what would keep my form from displaying when the page is loaded from the beginning?
[21:21:57] <tash> display: something?
[21:22:08] <destryalhmns> set the style or class to initially either be display:none or visibility:hidden
[21:22:35] <csalvato> sorry didnt see your replies right away
[21:22:39] <destryalhmns> display:none means it takes up not space and is invisible, visibility:hidden means it is invisible but doesnt take up space
[21:22:49] <csalvato> destryalhmns i found the problem -- i was declaring the callback with the success: variable
[21:22:59] <joshsmith> destryalhmns: you can sign up with email
[21:23:01] <csalvato> destryalhmns in lines 6 to 9
[21:23:09] <joshsmith> destryalhmns: you don't need to do linkedin
[21:23:10] * destryalhmns csalvato huzah
[21:23:30] <csalvato> destryalhmns aye!  problem was actually that my PHP class was causing an error :P
[21:25:01] <KayleL> I am having an issue with parsing my json. The json request would just produce a simple array, looks like ["actor", "actress"] however, when I used $.getJson, it gives mean an whole object when I just need it to be a simple array.
[21:25:55] <destryalhmns> not sure if this is the answer but have you tried getJson[].whatever
[21:25:59] <destryalhmns> sry
[21:26:05] <destryalhmns> not sure if this is the answer but have you tried getJson[0].whatever
[21:26:42] <KayleL> I could do $.getJson(url).responseText, but it interepts the array as a string e.g. "["actor", "actress"]"
[21:28:28] <tash> destryalhmns: can I just add the dialog-popup line to my existing click function?  See line 8 of this http://pastie.org/3223115
[21:30:58] <destryalhmns> that probably wont work because if your dialog is not absolutely positioned it wont get positioned where you want it? are we on the same page or are you past this?
[21:34:01] <tash> i'm not past it
[21:34:26] <tash> I already had a click event and was just trying to incorporate what you suggested.
[21:35:56] <destryalhmns> tash
[21:36:27] <destryalhmns> style=
[21:36:30] <destryalhmns> sry...
[21:36:59] <destryalhmns> style="position:absolute;" on your dialog, run it and see where it is
[21:37:12] <fission6> $(document).bind('keydown', 'right', function() { how would i stop the event from bubbling up
[21:38:31] <tash> destryalhmns: it is in the bottom left hand side of the page ... I did style="position: absolute;" and took out visibility: hidden
[21:39:10] <tash> I'd really like the form to "pop up" over the center of the page.
[21:40:32] <destryalhmns> fission... my guess is use debugger when the event is fired and look for something you can plug into .event.stopPropagation()
[21:40:39] <destryalhmns> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[21:40:55] <destryalhmns> tash, you want it in the middle?
[21:41:34] <tash> destryalhmns: I like this a lot http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/modal-form.html
[21:41:41] <tash> maybe I should just incorporate it
[21:41:49] <tash> click on the Create new user button.
[21:42:04] <tash> that's the effect I'm really shooting for.
[21:42:35] <destryalhmns> okay thats not hard at all
[21:42:44] <destryalhmns> what goes in your pop up?
[21:42:56] <destryalhmns> what i mean is....
[21:43:12] <destryalhmns> you just need to make sure you can get the height and width of that div, with me?
[21:43:38] <destryalhmns> $(selector).height/width() do wonders
[21:43:47] <tash> I literally want to input fields and a submit button :)
[21:43:59] <tash> Description:, Price:, and Submit
[21:44:07] <tash> input type="text" on both of them.
[21:44:34] <destryalhmns> but if you can get it all you need to do is something like.... height:50%, position:absolute;top:half the width of the popup
[21:45:13] <tash> two* input fields :P
[21:45:14] <tash> can't type
[21:45:31] <destryalhmns> *top:50%; sry
[21:48:35] <destryalhmns> two inputs and a submit is easy
[21:49:07] <destryalhmns> first of all make your popup and try .height/width() on it, if that works your are like 1 and a half steps away from fancy
[21:49:10] <destryalhmns> try it now
[21:51:15] <tash> I don't know what you mean by make my popup ... that's what I can't figure out. I have my form.  Without hiding it to begin with, It is not at the center of the page vertically, and on the far left horizontally.
[21:51:48] <destryalhmns> alert($("#myDiv").width());
[21:51:50] <tash> so when I click on a particular button, I want that to show up in the middle of the page on top of the page ... like that modal form I showed you
[21:51:51] <destryalhmns> what does it say?
[21:51:54] <tash> sec
[21:53:16] <tash> 232
[21:53:22] <destryalhmns> okay cool
[21:53:25] <destryalhmns> we have a number
[21:53:38] <destryalhmns> give it the following style
[21:54:00] <destryalhmns> position:absolute;left:50%
[21:54:08] <destryalhmns> see where it lands
[21:54:59] <tash> toward bottom of the page ... off-center to the right a little
[21:55:06] <destryalhmns> good
[21:55:18] <destryalhmns> and you are launching it with jquery?
[21:55:38] <tash> I am not launching it all yet ... that's what I'm trying to do though
[21:55:47] <tash> click on my edit button ... pop this up
[21:56:00] <destryalhmns> where does the this come from?
[21:56:01] <tash> fill in the input fields and Submit
[21:56:18] <destryalhmns> is it hard coded into js? are you cloning it from the dom? does it come from ajax?
[21:56:40] <tash> where does what come from exactly? sorry
[21:56:57] <destryalhmns> where is the html for the popup
[21:57:21] <tash> oh, it's a form within a div that I just put in the body tag =\
[21:57:31] <tash> wanted to hide it, and show it when button is clicked
[21:57:37] <destryalhmns> okay cool
[21:57:44] <tash> so, when page loads ... user has no idea its there
[21:57:55] <destryalhmns> so when initially loaded it is not visible?
[21:57:58] <tash> then, they click on Edit button ... it shows up .. and then I do some ajax to backend
[21:58:09] <tash> correct, not visible when initially loaded is what I want
[21:58:20] <tash> right now, though, it is visible b/c I'm not hiding it or anything
[21:58:22] <destryalhmns> so what are you doing to make it not visible? like, why isnt it visible?
[21:58:26] <tash> I just wanted to see where it landed
[21:58:45] <tash> sorry for the confusion
[21:58:49] <destryalhmns> np
[21:58:51] <tash> right now, it is visible on page load
[21:58:56] <tash> I don't want it to be
[21:59:00] <destryalhmns> okay perfect
[21:59:02] <tash> I only want it shown when I click on edit
[21:59:14] <destryalhmns> step 1: give it the style display:none
[21:59:17] <tash> thx so much, btw
[21:59:21] <destryalhmns> try that and make sure it isnt visible
[21:59:35] <destryalhmns> np, i do a billion x harder things at work all day, this is cool
[22:00:09] <tash> k, it's not visible after display: none
[22:00:17] <destryalhmns> i have to interpret code someone wrote like 5 years ago
[22:00:20] <destryalhmns> good
[22:00:25] <tash> ouch, that sucks
[22:00:27] <destryalhmns> thats how its supposed to work
[22:01:34] <tash> k
[22:02:07] <destryalhmns> now when you call the popup use jquery to give it the style (you should consider making this into a class later) style="position:absolute;display:static;"
[22:02:42] <destryalhmns> sry
[22:02:44] <destryalhmns> backwards
[22:02:50] <destryalhmns> hold on
[22:03:38] <tash> :P A pastie would rock, but you don't have to
[22:06:42] <destryalhmns> position:absolute;display:block;
[22:06:44] <destryalhmns> sry
[22:06:53] <destryalhmns> try that, should work
[22:08:13] <destryalhmns> whatever result you get just say it
[22:09:29] <tash> sec
[22:10:13] <tash> bottom left of page
[22:10:51] <destryalhmns> working on a pastie
[22:12:38] <tash> thx
[22:14:01] <tw2113> this should rerieve the content of a span with the id of #lat right?
[22:14:03] <tw2113> var thelat = $('#lat').html();
[22:14:35] <destryalhmns> this will take a minute or two and then ill post it on pastebin
[22:18:23] <destryalhmns> keep your pants on...
[22:19:39] <tash> destryalhmns: laptop died
[22:19:45] <tash> back, not sure if I missed anything
[22:20:09] <destryalhmns> nope nothing
[22:20:16] <destryalhmns> just the usual fighting with css
[22:20:23] <destryalhmns> ill have a simple example in a minute or so
[22:20:50] <DEADB33F> Anyone know how can I retrieve the contents of a <link> element?
[22:21:28] <DEADB33F> I'm trying to get the entire stylesheet as a string
[22:21:44] <destryalhmns> 120 seconds away from answer...
[22:24:25] <fullsailor> DEADB33F: I think you would have to get the link's href attribute and then ajax in the contents.
[22:25:12] <DEADB33F> Yeah, that kinda sucks though when its already been loaded once.
[22:25:27] <DEADB33F> I guess as long as it's cached properly it wont matter.
[22:27:27] <destryalhmns> lol this is why its hard to find help
[22:27:32] <destryalhmns> hold on..... HOLD ON
[22:29:27] <tash> :)

[22:46:37] <tash> i pm'd you
[22:55:42] <destryalhmns> dont code drunk ppl, its not effecient
[22:56:02] <tw2113> but it's when you have the best ideas
[22:56:06] <tw2113> take notes when drunk
[22:56:12] <tw2113> pray you can read it the next day
[22:56:16] <destryalhmns> dont drive drunk either, but DEFINITELY.... dont code drunk
[22:56:43] <tw2113> i'd prefer drunk coding over drunk driving
[22:57:00] <tw2113> drunk driving can be done by pretty much everyone, drunk coding has a more limited audience
[22:57:03] <destryalhmns> i just pray to wake up the next day and not be abducted

[23:59:16] <ussher_> I want to hide some divs depending on what the value of a slider is.  whats the best way to give each div a value from 1 ~ 100 then hide them?  The slider increments in 10's so hide everthing below 10, hide everything below 20, everything below 30. etc.
[23:59:55] <ussher_> my first thoughs say a switch, but id be willing to bet there is a better way.
