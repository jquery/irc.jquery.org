[00:01:43] <coldhead> great job everyone, take 5
[00:02:17] <blackspotwiggins> thanks, i will
[00:02:42] <coldhead> smoke if you got em
[00:04:30] <pingec> Does anyone here use visual studio as ide?
[00:06:57] <thomedy015> i just learned that doc.ready only happens once
[00:07:32] <thomedy015> so any internal linking is not registered on ready
[00:09:16] <Whirl3d> and....
[00:09:42] <Whirl3d> using hashtag navigation you don't have to bind any internal links.
[00:10:21] <blackspotwiggins> why use hashtag navi
[00:10:27] <blackspotwiggins> we have html5 histroy api
[00:10:32] <blackspotwiggins> which is better in every way
[00:10:44] <Whirl3d> especially for IE678
[00:11:48] <thomedy015> agreed on the hashtag thing
[00:12:18] <thomedy015> the html5 history api is awesome but doesn't work on olderbrowsers
[00:12:27] <Whirl3d> besides, the binding the hashchange event works for html5 natively with a fallback to ben allman's hashtag plugin if necessary
[00:12:56] <thomedy015> im just trying to figure out how to have a persistence thing
[00:13:16] <Thoemchen> whats nowadays the way to go for implementing hotkeys in jquery? The js-hotkey project was last updated two years ago...
[00:13:36] <thomedy015> you know i could store the urls in an array and if the urls in element n and n - 1 are the same no $(div).empty()
[00:13:42] <thomedy015> which is what i do first now
[00:14:03] <thomedy015> is using the window object to store an array not safe i hear stuff
[00:14:08] <thomedy015> i dont know how much of it is true
[00:14:30] <Whirl3d> what do you mean a persistence thing?
[00:14:43] <thomedy015> well i thinkit would be considered persistence
[00:14:55] <thomedy015> basically once i get in the site ... doc.ready
[00:15:09] <thomedy015> create an array and store each hash in the array as i click arround
[00:15:26] <thomedy015> and then compare the elements
[00:15:31] <blackspotwiggins> fuck ie678
[00:15:31] <Whirl3d> and why do that?
[00:15:33] <blackspotwiggins> let them use nonajax
[00:15:46] <Whirl3d> why compare?
[00:15:48] <thomedy015> right now if you go to my page
[00:15:58] <thomedy015> and click on the top d in that sub menu
[00:16:04] <thomedy015> and it takes you to designer page
[00:16:07] <thomedy015> and then click the word designer
[00:16:11] <thomedy015> those are the same links
[00:16:16] <thomedy015> in 2 different ways
[00:16:22] <Whirl3d> so the hash shouldn't change
[00:16:25] <thomedy015> and because the has doesn't change
[00:16:29] <thomedy015> thers no load
[00:16:42] <Whirl3d> there shouldn't be if you are already on the page
[00:16:42] <thomedy015> and since the function starts with .empty
[00:16:48] <thomedy015> theres no content
[00:17:10] <thomedy015> i do the empty so that when i slide around its cleaner
[00:17:21] <Whirl3d> ;)
[00:17:35] <Whirl3d> so in the callback fo ryour slapping around do a show
[00:17:46] <Whirl3d> which you should be doing anyways
[00:17:49] <Whirl3d> right?
[00:17:52] <thomedy015> you know what yep
[00:17:57] <thomedy015> okay so instead of empty do a hide
[00:18:15] <thomedy015> and then the load will do its thing
[00:18:19] <thomedy015> and then show will still be as clean
[00:18:21] <Whirl3d> sure. but it's not gonna reload if you click a link with the same hash
[00:18:21] <thomedy015> that will work
[00:18:27] <thomedy015> and then no
[00:18:31] <thomedy015> bad slide
[00:18:36] <thomedy015> and the content still loads normal
[00:18:38] <thomedy015> i like it
[00:18:48] <thomedy015> and no restructuring of more then like 2 lines
[00:18:55] <thomedy015> lots of effort saved
[00:19:02] <thomedy015> dude thats awesome
[00:19:14] <thomedy015> oh im psyched
[00:19:17] <thomedy015> one sec
[00:21:55] <teleyinex_> Hello everyone
[00:22:09] <teleyinex_> I'm struggling with d3.js text function :-)
[00:22:26] <teleyinex_> I want to return a name string within the d3.js text function
[00:22:41] <teleyinex_> however, the problem is that in order to get the string I've to run an ajax query
[00:22:52] <teleyinex_> I'm using a promise
[00:23:01] <teleyinex_> something like var promise = getName(id);
[00:23:17] <teleyinex_> getName(id) return $.ajax({url:url, type:xml});
[00:23:54] <Es0teric> how do i remove four child elements ?
[00:23:58] <teleyinex_> then in the text(function(d,i){ var promise = getName(d); promise.done(function(user) { return user.name}))
[00:24:05] <teleyinex_> however this is not working :(
[00:24:20] <teleyinex_> do you have an idea what I'm doing wrong?
[00:24:33] <Nobita> hello, I'm having an html which is having an <img> tag I'm looking to apply that image a "title" attribute with help of CSS since I can only make changes to it, anyhow I came to know from #css that I can't with CSS but can I do it with jQuery?

[00:39:26] <Godfather_> what i paste is possible?
[00:41:22] <Godfather_> i have to call a php file inside a jquery script, but the js script is called from a rewrited url like mysite.com/a/b/c/myrewrite
[00:42:06] <pdyz> hi all
[00:42:59] <pdyz> I've faced a weird problem here … I replace my html content using $('html').html('blah') and on IE the content wasn't showing
[00:43:04] <pdyz> but fine on other browser
[00:43:26] <pdyz> I've check console.log($('html').html()); the content is there … just somehow IE doesn't display
[00:45:49] <coldhead> can you use $('body') instead?
[00:46:07] <coldhead> if you replace the entirety of <html> you'll drop all your scripts
[00:46:10] <coldhead> including jQuery
[00:46:22] <coldhead> it will be like hitler in poland all over again
[00:48:10] <pdyz> coldhead: I'm actually writing a bookmarklet, injecting a custom iframe to the page. so i re-wrote the whole html
[00:48:22] <coldhead> that's very brave
[00:48:34] <coldhead> i'd still try to avoid nuking the whole of html
[00:48:37] <pdyz> i iframe the original content … but somehow it doesn't display the content in IE …but fine for other browser
[00:48:46] <coldhead> ie probably does a lot of magic stuff to the <html>
[00:48:51] <coldhead> and will get confused
[00:49:16] <coldhead> if you must persist in this folly can you link us to a live demo?
[00:50:25] <pdyz> coldhead: errmm … the javascript is stored in our internal network … I think the administrator won't be happy to open to external :D
[00:53:59] <coldhead> pdyz: a simple working demo at http://jsfiddle.net/ will do nicely :)
[00:54:12] <coldhead> you don't have to expose any of your precious secrets
[00:56:43] <depy> hi guys
[00:57:23] <depy> can I somehow wrap my normal functions with deferred/promise so I can use them inside $.when ?
[00:58:40] <pdyz> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/vtJX9/
[00:59:25] <pdyz> as you can see from the jsfiddle, the bookmarklet works fine on almost all browser (even android browser!)… but not on IE8
[00:59:52] <coldhead> that's not a working demo : )
[00:59:54] <coldhead> Uncaught ReferenceError: v is not defined
[01:00:45] <Dr-Bombay> depy: why would you want to do something like that
[01:01:32] <depy> so I can do for example  $.when( fadeIn, doStuff, fadeOut)
[01:01:53] <depy> or did I complicate it too much?
[01:02:15] <Thoemchen> how can I focus a table row? I'm having a shortcut to go trough the <tr>s and I need the window to scroll down with my <tr>s
[01:02:46] <Dr-Bombay> and doStuff is the "normal function"?
[01:02:52] <depy> yes
[01:03:30] <Dr-Bombay> sorry, I don't know
[01:05:51] <coldhead> pdyz: i'm getting gone but you can repaste your demo here for help anyhow
[01:06:03] <pdyz> ok thanks
[01:07:36] <depy> I figured it out, I can use pipe to avoid wrapping standard functions in deferred/promise
[01:15:28] <thomedy> okay i got a solution i think
[01:15:48] <thomedy> i have been trying to come up with something for non hash changing
[01:15:57] <thomedy> cuz .load, .ready only happen in the page
[01:16:18] <thomedy> but ifi check the href to the hash and if they are the same then not hiding and the load remains
[01:16:20] <thomedy> solid
[01:22:41] <thomedy> solvd
[01:38:36] <spaghetticode> hi
[01:39:21] <spaghetticode> anyone recommend some good form protection techniques using jQuery?
[01:39:24] <Whirl3d> thomedy why are you handling the events on your buttons?
[01:40:03] <spaghetticode> I had an idea for using multiple divs, hover-states and contains()... but not sure if that would be robust in avoiding form bots.
[01:40:33] <Whirl3d> I like the honeypot method
[01:41:45] <spaghetticode> Whirl3d, not familiar with existing techniques (beyond horrible things like Captcha), is that where you have extra-fields which are meant to remain empty and trick the bot into filling them?
[01:42:17] <Whirl3d> precisely
[01:42:47] <Murg|e> Whirl, or others. This is not the right syntax but this is sort of what I'm looking for.  Any hints? http://jsfiddle.net/3tu9n/
[01:43:02] <fRAiLtY-> Can jQuery work out dates/times to the extent where if I give it an integer it can work out that many days in the future etc?
[01:43:15] <Whirl3d> that and some human logic that is really simple...something like write this number by while holding down the shift key.   It works pretty cool
[01:43:34] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, are you for real?
[01:43:42] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Very much so
[01:43:45] <Whirl3d> no, jquery doesn't do math. LOL
[01:43:50] <Whirl3d> of course it can
[01:43:54] <Whirl3d> it's javascript
[01:44:40] <fRAiLtY-> So if for example I wanted to build a system which detected a the next weekday when given an integer, js could do this?
[01:44:50] <NodeX> yup]
[01:44:51] <fRAiLtY-> And I could build in exceptions for  bank holidays etc
[01:44:51] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[01:45:11] <Whirl3d> that's trickier, but it can be done.
[01:45:24] <fRAiLtY-> Would PHP be a better option then use jQuery to "check" it?
[01:45:26] <Whirl3d> have you looked at the datepciker in jquery UI?
[01:46:10] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just thinking I know PHP better and it might be quicker for me to build it in PHP then get jQuery to check that script for a date and return it?
[01:46:41] <Whirl3d> you just want days different?
[01:47:40] <Murg|e> haha, i got it. I was so close lol.
[01:48:02] <fRAiLtY-> Basically my website sells print, so the last option is to get the despatch time, so it will return an integer, 1 5 or 10. So if it returns 1, add 1 to todays date, same for 5 and 10. But we don't despatch on weekends and bank holidays so it would have to detect this and "skip" them so to speak
[01:48:22] <spaghetticode> Whirl3d, I might try using the honeypot method, but I wanted to know whether or not (in principle) using jQuery to obtain the state/value of a few hover divs could foil bots...
[01:49:03] <Whirl3d> do you have a list of bank holidays?
[01:49:09] <Whirl3d> by day
[01:49:22] <Whirl3d> what country?
[01:50:32] <blackspotwiggins> spaghetticode, tablets or other touch devices dont have hover btw
[01:51:02] <Whirl3d> good point
[01:51:05] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, good point
[01:51:13] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  It's UK
[01:51:20] <fRAiLtY-> I have a list of bank holidays yes
[01:51:39] <fRAiLtY-> http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/employment/employees/timeoffandholidays/dg_073741
[01:51:42] <NodeX> fRAiLtY- : what is it for?
[01:51:57] <NodeX> I wrote somehting about 5 years ago for  a holiday planner for my odl company
[01:51:58] <spaghetticode> hmm ... does the droppable function work on tablets (intuitively I would imagine so...)?
[01:51:58] <blackspotwiggins> i'd use rate limiting and add a hidden field, which if filled would indicate a bot
[01:51:59] <NodeX> old *
[01:52:02] <blackspotwiggins> seems to work pretty ok
[01:52:28] <spaghetticode> if so, maybe something using that would work (mouse co-ordinates over a 'home' area = human, otherwise not)...
[01:52:47] <fRAiLtY-> NodeX:  It's for a delivery calculator. On my website people get the option to choose a despatch time in days, so I want to get todays date then add their chosen despatch time to it to return an actual date, excluding holidays and weekends
[01:52:59] <blackspotwiggins> IMO anything extra the user has to do is annoying as hell
[01:53:06] <blackspotwiggins> recaptcha and friends included
[01:53:12] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  ^^
[01:53:20] <NodeX> fRAiLtY-: similar to what I made, I used a combination of PHP and jquery when I did it
[01:53:44] <NodeX> I had to input all the bank holidays into a datastore
[01:53:54] <howardgrigg> hi guys - when I remove a class with removeClass() I see it works in the inspector but when i click on the item it still triggers a function that should only fire when the removed class is present
[01:53:55] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, yep that's what Whirl3d advised too and it seems a pretty much recommended technique. I just wanted to get an idea whether or not other methods might be possible (as in the ones I mention above)
[01:54:02] <howardgrigg> what's going on?
[01:54:12] <NodeX> howardgrigg : unbind the handler
[01:54:38] <howardgrigg> NodeX: thanks but pretend I dont know much…
[01:54:39] <NodeX> sommething like .... $(elem).removeClass().unbind('click');
[01:54:45] <howardgrigg> oh k
[01:54:49] <howardgrigg> yea thatll work
[01:54:57] <NodeX> if it's click ofcourse!
[01:55:04] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, btw what's "rate limiting"? the number of submissions from an IP address over a specific period of time?
[01:55:18] <NodeX> correct
[01:55:20] <blackspotwiggins> howardgrigg, NodeX i'd use event delegation, that way the event wont trigger if you remove the class
[01:55:43] <NodeX> blackspotwiggins : I wouldnt bind it the way he did in the first place ;)
[01:55:45] <blackspotwiggins> spaghetticode, yea a human could and would submit the form at a limited speed
[01:56:05] <howardgrigg> NodeX: how would you do it?
[01:56:12] <NodeX> ^^ event delegation
[01:56:59] <howardgrigg> that worked but now the link is functioning normally instead of ajax - which makes sense but I'm keen to disable it all together
[01:57:06] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, cool, I'll look into that. Sounds like it might be something requiring a little bit of javascript manipulation to calculate and set an acceptable rate... thanks for the tip :)
[01:57:12] <howardgrigg> ill look up event delegation :)
[01:57:25] <blackspotwiggins> spaghetticode, you rate limit at server side
[01:57:35] <blackspotwiggins> a bot certainly would not use js
[01:58:06] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, true, wasn't thinking.
[01:58:52] <blackspotwiggins> spaghetticode, there is even a special http code for that
[01:58:53] <blackspotwiggins> 429
[01:59:02] <NodeX> not entirely true, some bots can and do use javascript, but for the most part they dont
[01:59:39] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, hmm, basically some kind of anti-DOS code?
[01:59:52] <spaghetticode> like hammering an ftp and getting a timeout?
[02:00:13] <blackspotwiggins> kinda
[02:00:36] <blackspotwiggins> you still are doing some processing on server, just not as much
[02:00:37] <spaghetticode> I guess I'll have to read-up on that
[02:00:54] <sonnie> hey, i want to disable the title bar totally by using jqueryui - dialog. how?
[02:01:14] <spaghetticode> I hadn't come across that as a technique for combating form bots before.
[02:03:44] <howardgrigg> NodeX: this is what I
[02:03:45] <blackspotwiggins> it's the same reason why bcrypt is used for passwords
[02:03:45] <howardgrigg> I'm trying to do http://codepen.io/pen/6422/2
[02:03:45] <blackspotwiggins> instead of md5
[02:03:46] <blackspotwiggins> you can try billions of md5 hashes a second
[02:03:46] <spaghetticode> ah
[02:03:46] <NodeX> spaghetticode : a common trick is to use memcache or w/e to record number of attempts on a form and after about 5 from an IP simply 404
[02:03:46] <blackspotwiggins> bcrypt is much much slower
[02:03:46] <blackspotwiggins> not sure about the exaclt number, but i guess around 100/second
[02:03:46] <blackspotwiggins> -l
[02:04:01] <NodeX> most webservers will rate limit for you nowerdays too
[02:04:06] <spaghetticode> blackspotwiggins, that makes sense, sounds a very good technique.
[02:04:07] <NodeX> the good ones at least
[02:04:47] <spaghetticode> NodeX, ah, k that seems a straightforward implementation of the idea.
[02:04:50] <Naeblis> I have a select2 which hides when the selected value changes. How can I hide it even if the selected value remains the same?
[02:05:17] <NodeX> trigger('change');
[02:06:44] <spaghetticode> got another question, tangentially related to the previous, is it possible to use jQuery to actually read the value of a php variable?
[02:07:19] <blackspotwiggins> if you create an api for it
[02:07:37] <NodeX> only via an api / request or if PHP echo's it directly into the variable
[02:07:37] <blackspotwiggins> but the preprocessing part of php is usually the limit part
[02:07:49] <NodeX> var foo = '<?php echo('bar'); ?>';
[02:07:49] <blackspotwiggins> limiting*
[02:07:58] <spaghetticode> I see
[02:08:03] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d: ^^ What do you think?
[02:08:41] <pingec> I have an xml document like this: var xml = 'some xml here', xmlDoc = $.parseXML( xml ), $xml = $( xmlDoc ); Now if I do an $xml.find('SomeNode'), how do I serialize the returned node back to a string? (I would like to extract a node out of the whole xml) ?
[02:09:45] <spaghetticode> so if you tried to use something like var myVar = $phpVar.toString or something... wouldn't work, you'd need php to basically process the variable and spit it out for the var assignment?
[02:10:04] <blackspotwiggins> pingec, i would imagine outerhtml does that
[02:10:27] <NodeX> spaghetticode : correct
[02:10:42] <NodeX> php being a "pre-processor"
[02:13:06] <Naeblis> I tried this: http://ideone.com/Qi5gl
[02:13:26] <Naeblis> doesn't seem like this is the way though
[02:13:29] <spaghetticode> hmm, I was hoping I could just snoop on the variables I create for php form submissions, using jQuery and maybe interject other processes in there, in response. I'm overcomplicating matters, but there's just so many intriguing possibilities/dead-ends.
[02:14:01] <spaghetticode> ok, well thanks for the ratelimit and thanks to you all for patiently answering my questions :)
[02:14:41] <spaghetticode> I'll probably be back with some questions around implementation time.
[02:20:22] <aaronmcadam> pingec: .text
[02:20:32] <aaronmcadam> pingec: .text() even

[02:30:50] <jost> aaronmcadam, I've looked at once, but that doesn't help
[02:31:07] <aaronmcadam> http://api.jquery.com/one/?
[02:31:29] <natas77> <div class='myclass'><p></p></div>
[02:31:30] <aaronmcadam> jost: you can use unbind either
[02:31:53] <aaronmcadam> jost: so in your change handler, unbind change
[02:31:54] <Dr-Bombay> $('div>p')
[02:32:04] <natas77> how can i get the p tag selected?
[02:32:05] <aaronmcadam> after you've done what u want

[02:32:18] <natas77> Dr-Bombay: thx
[02:32:31] <Dr-Bombay> natas: bah
[02:32:43] <natas77> Dr-Bombay: and how can i chech if the p tah has a class?

[02:32:52] <jost> aaronmcadam, ok, and then I'd need to rebind the change handler, do catch another change in the future...
[02:33:04] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:33:10] <aaronmcadam> that sounds wrong
[02:33:45] <natas77> aaronmcadam: $('.myclass>p').hasClass()
[02:33:50] <natas77> like this?
[02:33:54] <jost> because when I have two radiobuttons in a group, both of them change, when one is clicked. But I want the trigger to be executed only once
[02:34:00] <aaronmcadam> natas77: $('.myclass>p').hasClass('blah')
[02:34:09] <natas77> ok
[02:34:12] <natas77> super
[02:34:15] <aaronmcadam> oh you mean if it has a class at all?
[02:34:16] <natas77> thy guys
[02:34:26] <aaronmcadam> or do you want to check for a specific class
[02:34:33] <aaronmcadam> ah
[02:34:37] <natas77> specific class
[02:34:40] <aaronmcadam> no arguments will return true anyway
[02:34:54] <aaronmcadam> oh
[02:34:55] <Trisox> gymclass
[02:34:57] <aaronmcadam> that's ok then
[02:35:07] <Trisox> ;)
[02:35:08] <aaronmcadam> otherwise you could use filter
[02:35:22] <natas77> <div class='myclass'><p class=''mypclass></p></div>
[02:35:31] <natas77> aaronmcadam: like this
[02:35:42] <aaronmcadam> right
[02:35:49] <aaronmcadam> you can also just use `is`
[02:35:50] <Dr-Bombay> natas: when you say you want to check for the class, does that mean you want to only select ps that have that class?
[02:36:04] <aaronmcadam> or add it to your selector natas77
[02:36:17] <Dr-Bombay> (or read the documentation)
[02:36:18] <Trisox> $('.myclass>p').attr('class')   ?
[02:36:21] <Dr-Bombay> oh did I say that out loud?
[02:36:22] <natas77> what will be the best way?
[02:36:33] <aaronmcadam> what are you trying to do?
[02:36:36] <blackspotwiggins> best way would be to learn some css selectors
[02:36:37] <Trisox> checking for attribute class ;)
[02:36:45] <Trisox> haha blackspotwiggins
[02:36:53] <blackspotwiggins> oh wait, you were doing jquery development
[02:36:55] <blackspotwiggins> carry on!
[02:36:59] <natas77> the class name of my p tag never chances
[02:37:06] <natas77> its allways same
[02:37:13] <aaronmcadam> and you're trying to find it in the dom right
[02:37:15] <Trisox> ....
[02:37:19] <pingec> I guess I simply cannot create xml nodes with jquery
[02:37:31] <aaronmcadam> yea you can, tho it's not designed to do it
[02:37:36] <pingec> how?
[02:37:42] <aaronmcadam> you're looking for .text()
[02:37:43] <pingec> I need well formed xml
[02:38:20] <aaronmcadam> natas77: simply $('.class') will select the elements
[02:38:26] <Trisox> true !
[02:38:28] <Dr-Bombay> natas: I asked you a question earlier
[02:38:28] <pingec> like .text('<Books></Boks>') ?
[02:38:37] <Trisox> text?
[02:38:39] <pingec> *Books
[02:38:43] <Trisox> ? html
[02:38:46] <aaronmcadam> pingec: html
[02:38:55] <aaronmcadam> you were looking for a way to get the actual text node out
[02:38:55] <Trisox> text is plain text..
[02:38:57] <pingec> wont that ruin casing?
[02:39:00] <aaronmcadam> earlier
[02:39:07] <aaronmcadam> casing?
[02:39:09] <aaronmcadam> are you bonkers?
[02:39:26] <Trisox> bonkers hahaha !
[02:39:33] <pingec> I have an xml document
[02:39:36] <blackspotwiggins> the correct term would have been
[02:39:39] <blackspotwiggins> "u wot m8?"
[02:39:39] <pingec> And want to add a node
[02:39:48] <pingec> I dont think I can use .html
[02:39:52] <aaronmcadam> I'm not english
[02:39:57] <blackspotwiggins> pingec, append()
[02:39:58] <Trisox> ?append
[02:39:58] <caniuse> Trisox: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[02:40:01] <Trisox> haha blackspotwiggins
[02:40:09] <aaronmcadam> there you are now, xml is case sensitive, wowee
[02:40:22] <aaronmcadam> another reason it's shit
[02:41:48] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 'work';
[02:41:49] <caniuse> aaronmcadam: 'work'
[02:41:55] <aaronmcadam> oh!
[02:41:59] <aaronmcadam> new bot-t?!
[02:42:04] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[02:42:08] <aaronmcadam> damn
[02:42:10] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:42:40] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!'0'
[02:42:40] <caniuse> aaronmcadam: true
[02:43:36] <Dr-Bombay> case sensitivity is great, means you will never have to work with an XML code base where developers just pick whatever capitalization suits their fancy that day
[02:44:15] <aaronmcadam> haha Dr-Bombay <xs:assert test="lower-case($value) = ('red', 'green', 'blue')"/>
[02:44:57] <aaronmcadam> lowercase it aaaall
[02:44:58] <Trisox> caniuse: a coffee ?
[02:45:03] <Trisox> ?caniuse: a coffee ?
[02:45:07] <Trisox> oh :(
[02:45:15] <Trisox> answer was yes
[02:45:36] <Dr-Bombay> aaron: well at least for tag/attribute names
[02:46:07] <aaronmcadam> i'm very happy to say my XSLT days are long behind me
[02:47:06] <Dr-Bombay> it's a pity XML doesn't have semantically significant whitespace, that would have saved me even more code quality trouble
[02:47:13] <natas77> guys my html look like this : <div class="myclass padding15"><p class="marginZeroB">Please enter text here.</p></div> and i tray this and get false : jQuery('.myclass > p').hasClass('.marginZeroB')
[02:47:20] <natas77> what did i wrong?
[02:47:38] <Dr-Bombay> natas: you didn't read the documentation for the functions you're using
[02:47:58] <natas77> yes http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[02:48:12] <aaronmcadam> natas77 try see ?is
[02:48:17] <aaronmcadam> ffs
[02:48:18] <aaronmcadam> ?is
[02:48:18] <caniuse> aaronmcadam: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[02:48:32] <Dr-Bombay> compare your call to the examples in the hasClass documentation
[02:50:19] <pingec> append() does nothing on the xml doc object
[02:50:24] <pingec> works on html
[02:50:28] <natas77> Dr-Bombay: dou you mean the part with : $("div#result3").append($("p").hasClass("selected").toString());
[02:50:49] <Dr-Bombay> natas: you didn't ask about append
[02:50:52] <aaronmcadam> what's with the toStrijng?
[02:51:33] <aaronmcadam> natas77: hasClass returns a boolean
[02:51:44] <aaronmcadam> use a bloody selector
[02:51:54] <natas77> like is?
[02:52:03] <aaronmcadam> u don't need is
[02:52:08] <natas77> well this my html strukture <div class="myclass padding15"><p class="marginZeroB">Please enter text here.</p></div>
[02:52:25] <aaronmcadam> so just use the p's class then
[02:52:40] <aaronmcadam> instead of makin life hard for yourself
[02:52:50] <natas77> but this class mybee has a other tag tooo
[02:53:14] <Dr-Bombay> natas: please answer this question: when you say that you want to "check whether p has a class" what do you mean? Do you mean that you want to select only p elements with that class?
[02:53:16] <aaronmcadam> so qualify it with the div's class
[02:53:50] <aaronmcadam> $('.myclass').find('marginZeroB')
[02:53:54] <aaronmcadam> .
[02:54:10] <Dr-Bombay> it's pointless to give him more alternatives
[02:54:48] <aaronmcadam> yeh I know hhe
[02:55:00] <aaronmcadam> he's determined to do it the hard way
[02:55:30] <blackspotwiggins> pingec, http://jsfiddle.net/2ZMwn/
[02:56:03] <natas77> Dr-Bombay: yes i mean only p s with the clases
[02:56:06] <natas77> sorry
[02:56:18] <blackspotwiggins> natas77, stop being a web developer
[02:56:19] <blackspotwiggins> srsly
[02:56:20] <Dr-Bombay> all right.  $('div.myclass>p.mypclass')
[02:56:44] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY- did you get your date thing worked out?
[02:57:11] <fRAiLtY-> fRAiLtY-:  not yet, trying it through PHP first as I think it might be easier for me, we'll see!
[02:57:19] <fRAiLtY-> then use jQuery to get that script
[02:57:20] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[02:57:30] <Whirl3d> I did it in javascript in about 2 minutes
[02:57:56] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, really
[02:58:00] <Whirl3d> its easy. I'll make a fiddle for ya. Do you want all the shipping days in between or just the actual ship date
[02:58:13] <fRAiLtY-> Just the actual ship date
[02:58:13] <fRAiLtY-> ta
[03:00:00] <Naeblis_> Can I get some help? In this code: http://ideone.com/Qi5gl , the select dropdown only hides when the value changes. I want it to hide if the user just wants the value to remain the same.
[03:01:57] <NodeX> Naeblis_ : again trigger('change');
[03:02:12] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/MZrSS/
[03:02:41] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY- now we just need to check if this is a holiday (like I did for workday) and you got it
[03:03:52] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Shouldn't the next ship date be tomorrow?
[03:03:57] <fRAiLtY-> It comes up as Jul 04?
[03:04:08] <Whirl3d> I put nextShipDate(5)
[03:04:30] <Whirl3d> you can do nextShipDate(400) and it should work
[03:04:32] <fRAiLtY-> Ah gotcha
[03:04:46] <fRAiLtY-> Stupid question is this jQuery or prototype, hence the prototype in the fiddle?
[03:05:00] <Whirl3d> it's javascript
[03:05:12] <Whirl3d> the Date object in javascript is really rich
[03:05:25] <Whirl3d> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[03:06:03] <Cork> ...
[03:06:07] <Whirl3d> I just added the workday and getShipDate to the Date object...
[03:06:15] <Cork> i though you knew better then to link to w3fools...
[03:06:21] <Whirl3d> I do
[03:06:29] <Whirl3d> I was hoping to sneak by that one
[03:06:31] <Whirl3d> lol
[03:06:35] <Cork> heh
[03:06:38] <Cork> ?mdc date
[03:06:38] <caniuse> Cork: Date - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[03:07:18] <fRAiLtY-> So, excuse the php logic, but should I build an "array" of bank holidays then check against that to ensure it's not a bank holiday?
[03:07:23] <Whirl3d> I need to tell google to quit dominating my results with w3fools crap
[03:07:33] <Whirl3d> exxactly
[03:07:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: -site:w3cschools.com
[03:08:08] <Whirl3d> every time? or is there a setting somehwere?
[03:08:11] <Cork> have it hard coded in my search plugin :9
[03:08:27] <Whirl3d> That's what I need
[03:08:57] <Cork> i think if you use your google account you can config it
[03:09:08] <Cork> but then your searches are tracked by google instead :/
[03:10:14] <pingec> blackspotwiggins that generates html
[03:10:23] <pingec> not an xml document
[03:10:33] <pingec> which is case insensitive
[03:10:37] <blackspotwiggins> pinge i meant to demonstrate that append works pretty well
[03:10:41] <blackspotwiggins> pingec*
[03:10:43] <Skizu> Hey what's the difference between & and &&
[03:10:51] <blackspotwiggins> you can do whatever you want with it afterwards
[03:11:06] <nFFF> Cork, whats the with over reaction to w3cschools?
[03:11:13] <nFFF> I understand theres better resources
[03:11:13] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: it sucks
[03:11:15] <Cork> Skizu: & is bitwise and and && is "and"
[03:11:19] <nFFF> but web nerds love hating it
[03:11:28] <Cork> ?w3fools @ nFFF
[03:11:36] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: it keeps me from finding the w3 specifications
[03:11:37] <nFFF> yea I get it Cork seen it 10000x times
[03:11:39] <blackspotwiggins> nFFF, it's a really bad resource
[03:11:51] <nFFF> well actually compare the two examples here
[03:12:02] <Cork> nFFF: the info they provide isn't accurate
[03:12:03] <Skizu> Cork can you tell me in what case I should use which?
[03:12:06] <nFFF> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[03:12:11] <nFFF> they provide the same arguments fort the method
[03:12:15] <Cork> its very often jscript based, instead of javascript
[03:12:18] <Cork> and so on
[03:12:22] <Cork> its a REALLY bad resource
[03:12:33] <Dr-Bombay> ?w3fools @ Dr-Bombay
[03:12:43] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[03:12:44] <caniuse> Cork: W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention - http://w3fools.com/
[03:12:56] <nFFF> Cork, Im just saying your wrong in the example posted
[03:13:13] <Cork> nFFF: the point is they shouldn't be linked at all
[03:13:20] <nFFF> and I see the nerd hate all the time, its just annoying, w3c comes up first for most people, if the content of the page si relevant
[03:13:21] <nFFF> who cares
[03:13:22] <Cork> cause as long as ppl keep linking them
[03:13:31] <Cork> they will keep beeing at the top of search results
[03:13:36] <Cork> and keep missleading ppl
[03:14:11] <blackspotwiggins> nFFF, what's wrong in the date example?
[03:14:28] <nFFF> blackspotwiggins ?
[03:14:38] <shoky> Whirl3d: if you're logged into google you can remove w3schools from your search results
[03:14:40] <shoky> i did
[03:14:44] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: his point was they'r the same
[03:15:01] <Cork> but thats missing the point of why ppl shouldn't use them
[03:15:08] <nFFF> Its just whenever I google I never check urls jsut titles
[03:15:12] <Skizu> Cork, why would I use a & and not &&? Or vice versa
[03:15:15] <nFFF> and w3c comes up first for everythign
[03:15:20] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: w3c does not come up first for me. w3schools does
[03:15:23] <nFFF> so Im sure evryone gets now its a bad overallr esource
[03:15:27] <nFFF> it doesnt need ot be pointed out
[03:15:32] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: and w3c is in the second page, maybe
[03:15:39] <blackspotwiggins> Skizu, you prolly dont need bitwise and ever
[03:15:41] <nFFF> I meant w3csschools
[03:15:43] <Cork> ?eval 0x1 & 0x10 @ Skizu
[03:15:43] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL'
[03:15:45] <nFFF> if that wasnt obvious
[03:15:51] <Cork> uh...
[03:16:02] <Cork> ?eval (2 & 1) @ Skizu
[03:16:02] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL'
[03:16:07] * Cork nits caniuse 
[03:16:27] <Cork> Skizu: 0x01 & 0x10 => 0x11
[03:16:27] <Dr-Bombay> nfff: when I've just said that my problem with w3schools is that it pushes w3c out of the search result, no it's not fucking obvious you mean the opposite of what you said
[03:16:48] <BillyRocks> when i am changing the page(jquery mobile) in the pageinit is not calling from one page to another by button click
[03:16:48] <Skizu> Ah ok o.o
[03:16:58] <shoky> Whirl3d: https://www.google.com/reviews/t?hl=en  if you're logged in
[03:16:59] <Cork> Skizu: && is for when you want to do logical and statements, like if(a && b)
[03:17:08] <nFFF> Dr-Bombay, the whole context of the conversation is w3cschools...
[03:18:06] <NodeX> ok, troll-o-clock is upon us
[03:18:09] <Skizu> Ok, just someone was using & in an if statement not && and I was wondering why it still worked
[03:18:25] <NodeX> who here perfers Mootools over jQuery ?
[03:19:22] <Dr-Bombay> skizu: doesn't matter why it worked, it's still wrong
[03:19:27] <Whirl3d> Jeesh, if I had known it was going to be this big of a deal, I'd have spent the extra energy and scrolled down a little. LOL
[03:19:30] <Whirl3d> blocked
[03:19:46] <Skizu> Haha ok cheers
[03:19:58] <Dr-Bombay> skizu: wait
[03:20:07] <Whirl3d> now why we don't let bot-t handle the ruckus next time? SHould bot T be chiming in with his two cents worth?
[03:20:08] <Dr-Bombay> what is the if statement
[03:20:12] <Whirl3d> shoky, thanks for the link.
[03:20:45] <Skizu> if(a() & b() & !c)
[03:20:51] <Dr-Bombay> yeah, wrong
[03:20:57] <Skizu> All are true/false
[03:21:21] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/2/ I've built the array and checked the Lint and I'm missing {} but it seems to work for now. So do I begin checks around the if statement in the while loop?
[03:21:30] <NodeX> that can be evaluated as if(true and false and not false) .. which = true
[03:21:34] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  I think I might hit a snag with date formats too
[03:22:08] <Skizu> Really NodeX?
[03:22:31] <NodeX> if the functions spit out boolean true / false yes
[03:22:44] <NodeX> and the final c variable is a true/false
[03:23:46] <shoky> it's really simple. && is logical and, & is boolean and. they do different things. read it up
[03:23:59] <shoky> er i meant binary and
[03:24:16] <Skizu> Haha ok thanks guys
[03:24:53] <shoky> and know that
[03:24:58] <shoky> ?eval 1 == true
[03:24:58] <caniuse> shoky: true
[03:25:01] <shoky> ?eval 0 == false
[03:25:02] <caniuse> shoky: true
[03:25:16] <blackspotwiggins> true & true -> true incidentally
[03:25:23] <blackspotwiggins> same as with &&
[03:28:58] <fRAiLtY-> How can I check if the returned date is in the array, if it is move forward until it isn't? http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/2/
[03:42:51] <remysharp> Anyone know if it's possible to echo out *every* event that fires in jQuery. Note that I'd be hooking in from the command line or editing script in real-time inside of devtools to get this info.
[03:46:06] <sacho> remysharp, jquery.event.dispatch?
[03:46:37] <remysharp> sacho: you're going to have to give me more than that - can I hook that prop?
[03:46:52] <thomedy> i hear ie desn't like e.preventDefault
[03:46:59] <thomedy> what can i do to fix that
[03:49:08] <the_drow> is there a count() method for a selector?
[03:49:48] <shoky> selectors are strings
[03:50:32] <newbiee> i have two input with same id but one is populated. i want to get the value of the one that is populated..it is the last input in the dom
[03:51:12] <shoky> newbiee:  $('input:last').val()  /
[03:51:13] <shoky> ?
[03:51:15] <remysharp> okay, that sounds like a pretty solid 'no'. I guess I'm going to edit line 3039 to get this info out.
[03:51:25] <newbiee> can i add id to it
[03:51:45] <shoky> you can add an id to any selector
[03:51:54] <shoky> input#id:last
[03:52:04] <shoky> you shouldn't have two inputs with the same id though
[03:52:24] <newbiee> still i get nothing
[03:52:32] <shoky> then you're doing sometjhing wrong?
[03:53:06] <newbiee> i know ..the problem that i am having is that once the use writes something in the input box and saves then i need to save that and then transport the div above the list containing the saved item
[03:53:40] <shoky> doesn't sound like a problem. more like a task
[03:54:07] <newbiee> and i m having problem in this task with selecting dom elements
[03:54:38] <shoky> yet you don't say what it is
[03:56:44] <shoky> don't use the same id for two elements, you won't have problems
[04:06:26] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, it's kinda ugly because of how you started out with your dates, but http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/MZrSS/12/
[04:07:05] <thomedy> hey question about the way js animates whirl3d...
[04:07:10] <thomedy> it seems shakey
[04:07:18] <Whirl3d> quadruple check it---I am sure there are easier ways...like starting with your dates in a better format...but I'm too frazzled to think about it any more. That will at least work..
[04:07:29] <thomedy> things are happening fairly quickly but it just not very smooth
[04:07:31] <Whirl3d> thomedy, how so>?
[04:08:02] <thomedy> ummm... im not really sure how to describe it other than say the animate between slides seems itself to have paulsy
[04:08:04] <Whirl3d> are you using the transitions plugin to take advantage of hardware alleration builtin to css3 transforms?
[04:08:26] <thomedy> okay i remember someone saying that i havent done that yet
[04:08:32] <Whirl3d> and which easing type are you using?
[04:08:35] <andi> Hello
[04:08:40] <thomedy> just the default
[04:09:00] <thomedy> i didn't switch to a new easing cuz the rythm of the default ease i actually like
[04:09:02] <Whirl3d> use easeOutBack for your enter animation and easeInOutBack for your exit animation. try it
[04:09:10] <Whirl3d> oh
[04:09:11] <andi> When I realod a part of a page with ajax which contains a button do I need to execute anything to be able to catch the click event on this button?
[04:09:19] <thomedy> and the ones i looked at didn't really impress me
[04:09:30] <Whirl3d> well, lemme look at it real quick.
[04:09:39] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Great, but it seems to assume my dates in the array are formatted mm/dd/yyyy whereas it's actually dd/mm/yyyy hence the 6 returns the wrong result :x
[04:09:41] <thomedy> it just seems like a js thing
[04:09:52] <thomedy> but i might be wrong
[04:10:37] <Whirl3d> are you using queue:false in your animations?
[04:10:57] <thomedy> crap no i cant even remember i think it screwed some stuff up so i pulled it off again
[04:10:59] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, that was my fault. Fix it
[04:11:08] <thomedy> but i shuld prob fig out the error
[04:11:13] <thomedy> and put it in i guess
[04:11:27] <thomedy> but i have completely reorganized the animation since then
[04:11:34] <thomedy> and now everything runs off a hash instead
[04:12:32] <Whirl3d> thomedy, your animation should be handled by it's own little chunk of logic that isn't affected by hashchange or button click or programmatically. YOu call the animation the same for any of those events
[04:13:24] <thomedy> okay... well this is just taking forever..... thats not a your wrong thats a im tired of being wrong... but at the same time it has to be good so thank you
[04:14:12] <thomedy> your saying i shouldnt animate off of a hash change im not sure what event will fire it then
[04:14:30] <thomedy> because if im right .load and .ready only run once
[04:14:35] <thomedy> you open the site
[04:14:50] <thomedy> all internal linking is done somewhere else
[04:15:22] <newbiee> can't ihave two keydown events for the same element in the same page
[04:15:26] <newbiee> js page i mean
[04:16:33] <the_drow> why does alert($("#customerid").id); prints undefined?
[04:17:01] <thomedy> i might be wrong but you have id already
[04:17:05] <xec> the_drow: because "id" is not a property of a jquery object
[04:17:08] <thomedy> you dont need id again
[04:17:20] <thomedy> op thats a better answer
[04:17:22] <thomedy> ill shutup
[04:17:22] <xec> the_drow: you could do $("#customerid")[0].id
[04:17:36] <thomedy> like an array xec
[04:17:38] <shoky> or 'customerid' as thomedy points out :P
[04:18:12] <xec> shoky, thomedy: i assume this is pseudocode and he isn't actually selecting on a ID and then trying to retrieve it
[04:18:13] <shoky> thomedy dont shutup your answer is good
[04:18:17] <thomedy> if you really want id you could send in an event param and go event.target.id
[04:18:26] <shoky> xec: then he shouldn't post code he doesnt need/want
[04:18:30] <newbiee> how can i check for words that start with @ using regex
[04:18:40] <thomedy> yeay im learning
[04:18:42] <thomedy> i love it
[04:19:36] <shoky> newbiee: /^@/
[04:19:50] <shoky> wel that's for lines, not words
[04:20:23] <shoky> for words i guess it'd be /\b@/
[04:20:43] <xec> looks like a freaky smiley
[04:20:49] <shoky> ;DZ:dZ:DzdZD:ZD//
[04:20:58] <thomedy> well im just really confised how to write an effect without an event
[04:21:00] <xec> and that looks like a freaky regex
[04:21:01] <xec> ;D
[04:21:04] <shoky> ;p
[04:21:13] <thomedy> i must missunderstand something yoursaying whirl3d
[04:21:52] <the_drow> xec: ok thanks
[04:22:39] <xec> the_drow: like shoky and thomedy points out though, there's no reason you would ever use that code for anything useful, what exactly are you doing?
[04:23:25] <thomedy> dang it im so close
[04:23:39] <the_drow> xec: just testing. I am using microsoft dynamics crm which holds the value in a special injected attribute called datavalue
[04:23:40] <thomedy> but i dont like the idea that my code could be completely wrong
[04:23:58] <the_drow> and I am hooking the form with backbone/knockout (aka knockback.js)
[04:24:11] <shoky> oh my
[04:24:17] <shoky> how's knockback working out for you
[04:24:25] <xec> wait, both backbone and knockou?
[04:24:27] <xec> t
[04:24:27] <the_drow> still testing it
[04:24:32] <shoky> xec it's a hybrid :D
[04:24:32] <the_drow> yes
[04:24:42] <the_drow> xec: see knockback.js
[04:24:48] <xec> i see
[04:24:51] <xec> i didn't think that was an option
[04:25:00] * xec goes to google
[04:25:11] <the_drow> so I need to scan for all fields that have the DataValue attribute and fetch their id and DataValue in order to generate a model
[04:25:18] <the_drow> how can it be done?
[04:25:52] <xec> $("[DataValue]").each(function(){ console.log(this.id); }); ?
[04:26:00] <shoky> $('[DataValue]').xec.beat.me()
[04:26:04] <xec> :D
[04:26:35] <the_drow> this? oh goody
[04:26:47] <the_drow> I thought you always have to use the two parameters
[04:27:07] <the_drow> the problem is that $("[DataValue]") doesn't return any results
[04:27:13] <xec> yeah, "this" will be the current DOM element
[04:27:33] <xec> the_drow: so, maybe "DataValue" isn't an attribute?
[04:27:41] <ToreadorVampire> I'm in the process of developing a jq plugin and one of the things I would like (for extensibility purposes) is reusable functions that the plugin can make use of - but that (when extending the plugin for a specific web app) can be used as direct API methods by user code.  What's the recommended way to do this?
[04:27:51] <the_drow> but you can do $("someId")[0].DataValue and you have a result
[04:27:59] <thomedy> okay i know what im goign to do designer wise for content and its going to be even more work but i want this site to be awesome
[04:28:07] <raj> man, disappointing end to The Grey
[04:28:07] <shoky> expando property
[04:28:08] <xec> the_drow: that's a property
[04:28:12] <raj> shoky, wutup kid
[04:28:20] <shoky> damn i thought you said shutup kid
[04:28:23] <the_drow> so how do I collect those :/
[04:28:35] <raj> i'm not drunk yet
[04:28:36] <ToreadorVampire> Is it to store my 'api methods' at:  jQuery.myPluginName.apiFunctionName()
[04:28:41] <shoky> raj okz, i dont remember what the ending was, so it must've indeed been disappointing
[04:28:48] <the_drow> raj: I really want to be drunk :P
[04:28:51] <the_drow> or high
[04:28:54] <the_drow> or both
[04:29:01] <shoky> <pretty_high
[04:29:05] <shoky> <going_to_work
[04:29:07] <shoky> bye ;>
[04:29:08] <raj> depends if I have to interact with people
[04:29:09] <xec> the_drow: you can't select on properties, are there anything in the markup that could identify the elements you need?
[04:29:12] <raj> bye :)
[04:29:14] <the_drow> but what I am doing right now is better than document.all.dostuff
[04:29:16] <xec> is there*
[04:29:31] <the_drow> xec: this is a microsoft created markup
[04:29:32] <raj> how can I take all the classes from an element and put them on another element?
[04:29:43] <the_drow> I believe you know the answer yourself
[04:31:23] <Cork> raj: $(elm2).addClass($(elm1).attr('class'))
[04:31:41] <raj> aah, attr class, didn't even think of that
[04:31:42] <raj> thank you
[04:32:01] <Cork> prop might be better on second though
[04:32:05] <Cork> *thought
[04:32:49] <xec> is class a property though? i thought you got like an array of names or something
[04:32:50] <raj> why's that?
[04:33:02] <the_drow> well for each entity attribute there is a td that contains it
[04:33:26] <the_drow> it is named %attributeName%_d. for example customerid_d
[04:33:35] <Cork> raj: attr is whats on the original tag, and prop is whats browsers value
[04:33:53] <raj> what would be the difference?
[04:33:58] <Cork> ex. href
[04:34:08] <the_drow> xec: can I create a selector that selects the child element of elements with id of *_d?
[04:34:12] <xec> the_drow: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[04:34:39] <Cork> /url/file.png .attr('href') => '/url/file.png'; .prop('href') => 'http://www.example.com/url/file.png';
[04:34:53] <the_drow> and how do I get the child of that?
[04:35:04] <raj> interesting
[04:35:14] <raj> Cork, how would it be different with class=?
[04:35:17] <xec> the_drow: .children() perhaps?
[04:35:23] <the_drow> so it's *[id$="_d"]?
[04:35:38] <Cork> raj: $(elm)[0].class vs $(elm).attr('class')
[04:36:04] <xec> the_drow: close, more like $("[id$='_d']")
[04:36:21] <Cork> raj: and ya its prop classList
[04:36:25] <Cork> so class doesn't exist
[04:36:34] <Cork> (carry on :P )
[04:36:45] <noregret> i'm doing a .css(prop, set) in a hover() mouseenter is there a way to undo taht change in a mouseleave? only way i thought of is to save the value beforehand then setting it again
[04:37:08] <Cork> noregret: do it the right way
[04:37:10] <Cork> use a class
[04:37:19] <ToreadorVampire> ohwait, nm
[04:37:25] <ToreadorVampire> Found a better way in the API docs
[04:37:54] <Cork> noregret: .hover { my css }; .hover(function() { $(this).addClass('hover') }, function() { $(this).removeClass('hover') });
[04:38:02] <noregret> Cork: i was doing that before, but unfortunately, some CSS precendece is failing it
[04:38:16] <raj> Cork, .class gives me undefined
[04:38:16] <Cork> noregret: inline css?
[04:38:35] <noregret> Cork: no, from a css file
[04:38:35] <Cork> raj: check what i wrote a few mins ago
[04:38:46] <Cork> noregret: so use a longer selector
[04:38:47] <noregret> Cork: not sure how to go around it
[04:38:55] <Cork> you have a link?
[04:39:01] <raj> prop('class') gives me the same result as attr('class')
[04:39:13] <Cork> so they fall back to attr
[04:39:16] <newbiee> anyone know the channel for php
[04:39:16] <raj> prop('classList') is definitely pretty cool though
[04:39:20] <Cork> ##php
[04:39:21] <raj> k
[04:40:17] <the_drow> xec: wow it's really slow
[04:41:02] <noregret> Cork: http://pastie.org/4159595
[04:41:04] <Cork> the_drow: it first looks up every element on the page, then grabs there id attribute, then does a regex search on each string
[04:41:08] <Cork> ya, its slow
[04:41:17] <xec> what Cork said
[04:41:22] <Cork> you should NEVER look for parts of id's
[04:41:27] <noregret> Cork: precendence is on the tr that has the tr:nth... prop
[04:42:03] <Cork> noregret: .thover, table tr.thover {}
[04:43:02] <noregret> Cork: what ? you lost me
[04:43:18] <Cork> noregret: replace the css selector with that
[04:43:32] <Cork> .thover {} => .thover, table tr.thover {}
[04:43:40] <xec> the_drow: if you make a live demo (or at least post the markup) maybe we could help suggest something else
[04:43:42] <Cork> that should be all you need
[04:44:01] <noregret> Cork: jsut tried it, didn't work
[04:44:20] <Cork> noregret: so back to the original question then; do you have a link
[04:44:23] <Cork> as in a live link
[04:44:23] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt :hover work?
[04:44:27] <noregret> Cork: still see the new class crossed in firebug
[04:44:36] <Whirl3d> thomedy
[04:44:49] <blackspotwiggins> adding classes seems redundant in the place
[04:44:50] <fRAiLtY-> Grr, why http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/13/ I can't seem to get it to realise that 28/06/2012 is in the array, yet it still insists on returning it!!
[04:45:01] <noregret> Cork: no link, unfortunately
[04:45:19] <fRAiLtY-> If you place 1 in the function at the bottom, nextShipDate it returns tomorrow, 28th, yet that date is in the array to avoid!
[04:45:54] <noregret> Cork: you want to see what CSS properties are applied on that certain <tr> ? i can show those to you if you want
[04:46:35] <granden> I got a table like this <tr><td>img</td><td><span class="menutext">Text</span></td></tr> and like this $('tr').hover so when hovering I wanna change color of my menutext text on this tr element
[04:46:44] <granden> how would a selector for that look like?
[04:48:20] <fusion27> r there multiple <tr> elems?
[04:48:30] <blackspotwiggins> tr:hover .menutext { color: ULTRARAINBOWS! }
[04:48:44] <blackspotwiggins> protip - learn css before js
[04:49:15] <Cork> noregret: i would need the live server to see how the rules apply to the dom structure
[04:49:21] <Cork> or rather live site
[04:53:00] <xec> blackspotwiggins: you made me really really want ultrarainbowcolored text on my menu, but your code is not working! =(
[04:53:27] <blackspotwiggins> :(
[04:53:29] <blackspotwiggins> i know..
[04:55:44] <thomedy> sorry im slowly fading yes whirl3de
[04:55:50] <thomedy> im doing some content arrangment rightn ow
[04:55:58] <noregret> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vLxWy/ taht's what's happening with me
[04:58:40] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/vLxWy/1/
[04:59:08] <thomedy> if anyone sees whirl3d tell him that i see what hes saying witht he multpile types of easing
[04:59:10] <thomedy> that looks goog
[04:59:17] <thomedy> good
[04:59:22] <Cork> noregret: personally i would put those th in thead instad, but thats just me :)
[05:00:10] <noregret> thanks :)
[05:01:06] <Cork> noregret: if you put the selector last in the css i THINK it should work too
[05:01:11] <Cork> but no garantee there
[05:01:20] <noregret> ah
[05:01:34] <noregret> Cork: only .thover {} you mean ?
[05:01:42] <Cork> no the one i gave you first
[05:01:53] <Cork> your first one won't ever work for those rose
[05:01:59] <noregret> i'll try it
[05:02:04] <xec> Cork, noregret: how about http://jsfiddle.net/vLxWy/2/
[05:02:07] <shoky> damn. i just can't get myself to go to the office
[05:02:14] <Cork> as table td:nth will have higher accuracy
[05:02:18] <pachet> shoky: i cant get myself to go home
[05:02:24] <shoky> are you married?
[05:02:29] <xec> or did i miss something
[05:02:39] <pachet> shoky: yeah
[05:02:42] <shoky> ;]
[05:02:50] <noregret> Cork: yeh, it worked :)
[05:02:51] <Cork> xec: that doesn't give strictly the same result
[05:02:51] <shoky> maybe i should get married then
[05:02:56] <shoky> i'll work some
[05:02:58] <pachet> heh
[05:03:12] <Cork> xec: if you have spaces between cells that is
[05:04:51] <noregret> xec: interesting
[05:05:36] <noregret> whcih is faster in this case? js or css ?
[05:05:40] <xec> Cork: you could still just color the row, in that case http://jsfiddle.net/vLxWy/3/
[05:05:46] <xec> noregret: css is always faster
[05:05:48] <Cork> noregret: css
[05:05:50] <Cork> ya
[05:05:53] <noregret> aha
[05:06:02] <noregret> then i'll go with the css way in that case
[05:06:46] <shoky> granden:  $(this).find('.menutext').css(....)
[05:07:14] <shoky> granden: or what blackspotwiggins said
[05:07:16] <granden> shoky: I did like this, amybe it is wrong but it worked, $(".menutext", this).css?
[05:07:31] <shoky> granden that's exactly the same as $(this).find
[05:07:44] <xec> granden: why aren't you using css for something css can do easily, did you see blackspotwiggins' response?
[05:07:44] <granden> oh
[05:07:54] <granden> I did scroll up and saw it now.
[05:07:55] <Cork> noregret: ya, i have no problems with using :hover instead of a class, that wasn't the point ;)
[05:08:13] <granden> xec: shoky and blackspotwiggins I'm not using CSS directly because other stuffs should happens as well.
[05:08:20] <granden> that is not css.
[05:08:26] <noregret> Cork: true
[05:08:34] <granden> The text-color is only one part.
[05:08:37] <Cork> lol sorry that was to the wrong nick >_<
[05:08:43] <noregret> any idea of how to exclude the <th> row from the hover ? in css i
[05:08:44] <Cork> xec: that was for you >_>
[05:08:45] <noregret> ie
[05:08:52] <j_ayen_green> I'm not grasping something fundamental. I have this selector and function http://pastebin.com/7KL70x5u and when I inspect the selected element, the onClick was set properly, but when I put a breakpoint in the function it is not hit when clicked, nor does an alert in it fire.
[05:08:53] <noregret> lol
[05:09:05] <Cork> noregret: but it wasn't exactly not to you either :D
[05:09:10] <noregret> haha yeah
[05:09:15] <xec> Cork: ye i sort of jumped in the middle of the conversation, had a quick look at the javascript and went "wait what?"
[05:09:23] <Cork> ya
[05:09:43] <Cork> there area situations when :hover isn't enough though
[05:09:58] <granden> If I want to find out if a number is a double or integer how would I do that, probably some js not needing jquery.
[05:09:59] <noregret> xec: can I do a not or something in css ? to exclude the <th> row ie, is it possible ?
[05:10:01] <shoky> j_ayen_green $('#id1').click( function() { do_onClick('test', 'http..') } )
[05:10:24] <shoky> j_ayen_green: don't use onXXXX attributes
[05:10:25] <Cork> granden: js doesn't have integer or double
[05:10:37] <Cork> granden: you mean if it has decimals?
[05:11:06] <j_ayen_green> shoky: these particular links have to have the onClick text set in the html rather than use a click handler
[05:11:13] <Cork> granden: js stores all numbers as floating points (doubles)
[05:11:25] <xec> noregret: you can do tr:hover td {...} if you dont want the header
[05:11:43] <Cork> or move the headers into thead and separate it like that
[05:11:49] <Cork> it has other advantages too
[05:11:51] <shoky> j_ayen_green: do they.. good luck ;)
[05:11:59] <Cork> (like automatic repeat if you print the page)
[05:12:01] <noregret> ah thanks
[05:12:03] <xec> noregret: but that will color the cells and not the row, so it assumes you do not have spacing between cells
[05:12:36] <Cork> .tbody tr:hover {}
[05:12:55] <j_ayen_green> shoky: yeah, for some downstream analytics. but why would the function not fire if the link's onclick is set like that?
[05:13:10] <shoky> j_ayen_green: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gnNZU/
[05:13:37] <shoky> j_ayen_green: notice i chose 'no wrap (head)'  so it'd put the js in <head>
[05:13:46] <granden> Cork: Yeah wanna check if it got decimals.
[05:13:46] <noregret> if i want to handle a click evern on any place on the row, will (tr). click() be enough ? will eg clicking on the text trigger the click as well ?
[05:13:54] <xec> Cork: i assume you mean tbody not .tbody -- and if so it won't work because the <th> is inside the <tbody> ;)
[05:13:55] <granden> Found a pretty neat regexp solution on stack overflow
[05:15:37] <j_ayen_green> shoky: the import of the js file that contains the code occurs in the head, is that the same thing?
[05:16:03] <shoky> j_ayen_green: pretty much, but the do_onClick function has to be defined in the global scope
[05:16:14] <Cork> xec: yes i do, typo
[05:16:17] <shoky> j_ayen_green: do you get an error in your console when you click your element?
[05:17:01] <shoky> j_ayen_green if all else fails, maybe try window.do_onClick = function(....
[05:17:44] <shoky> j_ayen_green: what do downstream analytics have to do with an onclick attribute btw ?
[05:17:47] <j_ayen_green> shoky: <blushes> yeah...just checked in chrome. function do_onClick not defined ;)
[05:18:22] <shoky> ;]
[05:18:45] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/vLxWy/5/ this is what i talked about
[05:18:54] <j_ayen_green> shoky: well the actual function sets a few more variables that are used for omniture...and for some reason, in some structures a click handler doesn't result in the data being passed successfully
[05:19:31] <noregret> i see
[05:20:27] <Cork> granden: think num - Math.floor(num) !== 0 is the best you can do
[05:20:56] <Cork> possibly num - Math.round(num) !== 0
[05:22:21] <Cork> hmm no
[05:22:34] <Cork> % is prob even better
[05:23:14] <Cork> ?eval if(293452354.132 % 1) !== 0) { 'its a float'; }
[05:23:14] <caniuse> Cork: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token !=='
[05:23:19] <granden> Cork: Ok, if it is a .5 number I only got 1 1.5 2 2.5 and so on.
[05:23:19] <Cork> ?eval if((293452354.132 % 1) !== 0) { 'its a float'; }
[05:23:19] <caniuse> Cork: 'its a float'
[05:23:28] <granden> I would like to round down/up how would I do that?
[05:23:36] <shoky> had no idea you can mod a float
[05:23:37] <Cork> ?eval if((0.132 % 1) !== 0) { 'its a float'; }
[05:23:37] <caniuse> Cork: 'its a float'
[05:23:41] <Cork> ?eval if((132 % 1) !== 0) { 'its a float'; }
[05:23:41] <caniuse> Cork: null
[05:24:05] <Cork> ?eval if((-15.132 % 1) !== 0) { 'its a float'; }
[05:24:05] <caniuse> Cork: 'its a float'
[05:24:50] <shoky> damn. what other languages does that work in
[05:24:57] <Cork> c
[05:25:00] <Cork> c++
[05:25:01] <Cork> java
[05:25:01] <shoky> seriously
[05:25:03] <Cork> :)
[05:25:06] <shoky> fawk
[05:25:06] <Cork> ruby
[05:25:09] <Cork> perl
[05:25:11] <Cork> ...
[05:25:30] <Cork> not that exact syntax
[05:25:38] <Cork> but the equivalent
[05:27:21] <shoky> ah.
[05:27:25] <shoky> so it doesn't work in c
[05:27:28] <shoky> i am very relieved
[05:27:33] <Cork> not with % no
[05:27:42] <shoky> how do you mean then?
[05:27:43] <Cork> thats for ints only
[05:27:48] <shoky> yeap.. you scared me :)
[05:27:57] <Cork> they have functions that does that for floats
[05:28:03] <shoky> sure
[05:28:04] <Cork> but its the same thing
[05:28:21] <shoky> yea it's just math
[05:28:25] <Cork> you get it in js cause it only has one numeric format
[05:28:33] <shoky> aye
[05:28:38] <Cork> shoky: its actually a bit more complex then that
[05:28:49] <Cork> cause its floating points
[05:29:14] <Cork> % on an int is just a bit action
[05:29:21] <shoky> i know
[05:29:26] <shoky> which is why i was perplexed
[05:29:33] <shoky> for a moment :P
[05:29:38] <Cork> heh
[05:29:50] <troydm> i have an issue when i do $('div').html('new inside text') but it doesn't redraws the div element itself and only in IE, the rest browsers are working ok
[05:29:53] <Cork> but most scripting languages does it out of the box
[05:30:01] <shoky> good to know
[05:30:06] <shoky> i never thought to do it :)
[05:30:37] <Cork> troydm: try setting zoom: 1; on the element (css)
[05:31:29] <j_ayen_green> shoky: this is just too weird. With the $(document).ready(function() {   I tried putting the do_onClick function above and below the selector line (even outside the page ready function), and I'm always told it doesn't exist when I click
[05:31:45] <shoky> j_ayen_green: what selector line
[05:32:09] <j_ayen_green> the one I had in the pastebin. It and the do_onClick function both are within the page ready function
[05:32:09] <shoky> j_ayen_green: it should be in the outermost scope
[05:32:36] <shoky> j_ayen_green: if its inside a function, then its not in the outermost scope
[05:32:45] <shoky> page ready function included
[05:32:58] <j_ayen_green> the selector, or the do_onClick?
[05:33:02] <shoky> the do_onClick
[05:33:56] <shoky> <head> <script> function do_onClick(...){,...}  $(document).ready(....); </script> </head> <body>
[05:35:10] <j_ayen_green> shoky: that was it :)  thanks again
[05:35:19] <shoky> ;] np
[05:35:48] <pachet> im still puzzled about using .attr to set the actual onclick attribute :[
[05:35:56] <pachet> like using C4 to start a campfire
[05:37:15] <shoky> lol :)
[05:39:03] <troydm> Cork: didn't helped, i'm testing on IE8
[05:39:17] <newbiee> how can i toggle states for the same keypress
[05:39:32] <newbiee> if a key is pressed then one state and again if pressed change to another state in jquery
[05:39:37] <newbiee> sort of like toogle
[05:40:07] <pachet> ?.toogle()
[05:40:08] <bot-t> pachet, Couldn't find ".toogle()" in jQuery Docs.
[05:40:18] <shoky> toogle++
[05:40:32] <Cork> uh... what
[05:40:50] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.org toggle(
[05:40:51] <bot-t> Cork, No results found for 'site:api.jquery.org toggle('.
[05:41:05] <shoky> -.-
[05:41:07] <pachet> Cork: i was just being silly
[05:41:24] <Cork> ah wrong spelling >_<
[05:41:27] <pachet> newbiee: just save the current 'toggle' state in a variable, or property, or what have you
[05:41:38] <pachet> and then check that for any dependent logic
[05:42:27] <Cork> var state = []; .keypress(function(event) { state.push(event.charCode); });
[05:43:05] <Cork> var state = []; .keypress(function(event) { if($.inArray(event.charCode, state) { return; } state.push(event.charCode); });
[05:43:37] <Cork> bah missed the end parenthesis for inArray :/
[05:45:25] <shoky> troydm: got a fiddle of the issue?
[05:45:33] <fRAiLtY-> Grr, why http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/26/ I can't seem to get it to realise that 28/06/2012 is in the array, yet it still insists on returning it! If you place 1 in the function at the bottom, nextShipDate it returns tomorrow, 28th, yet that date is in the array to avoid!
[05:45:45] <gaspyr> hi folks of the most amazing freenode room :)
[05:46:01] <newbiee> there are two states i am not sure what to put initially
[05:46:22] <newbiee> say if i press r then a list has to be sorted in one way and again if i press r in another way
[05:46:49] <troydm> shoky: what?
[05:47:47] <shoky> troydm: www.jsfiddle.net
[05:47:58] <shoky> ?jsfiddle @ troydm
[05:47:59] <bot-t> troydm, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[05:48:30] <troydm> shoky: oic, thx i'll try doing that
[05:48:43] <shoky> troydm: for example:  http://jsfiddle.net/yzQDy/
[05:53:54] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: your loop is wrong
[05:54:35] <fRAiLtY-> :/
[05:54:38] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: you want bankHolidays[c-1]
[05:54:50] <shoky> instead of bankHolidays[c]
[05:55:14] <shoky> that's what you get for trying to make a "clever" loop
[05:55:30] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Still returns the wrong date (tomorrow)
[05:55:38] <shoky> huh
[05:55:51] <shoky> o sorry
[05:55:58] <shoky> was looking at the wrong thing
[05:56:10] <shoky> scratch everything i said ;D
[05:56:27] <fRAiLtY-> :P
[05:56:54] <Pantaloonix> Is there an easy way to get jQuery to include whitespace as text element? $("\n<element/>"). <-- The \n gets discarded and no text fragment is created.
[05:57:50] <gaspyr> ping rohan
[05:58:23] <shoky> fRAiLtY- ah
[05:58:36] <shoky> you're doing this.setDate(dm + 1);
[05:58:43] <shoky> so it returns 28 instead of 27
[05:58:52] <Pantaloonix> If I do $("<img/>\n<element/>") then a text fragment does (correctly) get inserted in the middle so presumably it's just trimming the string? Why do that.
[05:59:35] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Yes but it should check the array for that date (28) which exists, and skip it
[05:59:52] <silv3r_m00n> I am calling .trigger('resize') on a certain element , I need that event to not propagate above the element, how can I do that ?
[05:59:59] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: no , it finds the 27th and want to exit the function
[06:00:13] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: you want:  if (days > 0) this.setDate(dm + 1)
[06:00:23] <shoky> wants*
[06:00:34] <shoky> er. in the first sentence ;p
[06:00:43] <fRAiLtY-> How does that check the array or the workday function though?
[06:00:51] <shoky> what?
[06:00:52] <depy> silv3r_m00n,  event.stopPropagation() ?
[06:01:01] <silv3r_m00n> depy: where ?
[06:01:03] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: if days == 0 then it means you've found the date you want to return
[06:01:16] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: so you DONT want to add 1 to the date..
[06:01:18] <silv3r_m00n> depy: I am not writing an event handler
[06:01:33] <depy> silv3r_m00n, hm... tough one then O_
[06:01:36] <silv3r_m00n> I need default handling to take place and stop bubbling
[06:01:48] <depy> so who is handling that event?
[06:01:57] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  I'm lost, where is days == 0?
[06:02:05] <silv3r_m00n> some plugin, which I don't want to modify
[06:02:11] <depy> I see...
[06:02:12] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  right after you do days--  ...
[06:02:39] <fRAiLtY-> is that what days-- means?
[06:02:42] <shoky> huh?
[06:02:50] <shoky> days-- means decrease days by 1
[06:03:18] <fRAiLtY-> I don't want to decrease days at any point?
[06:03:21] <shoky> sure you do
[06:03:23] <fRAiLtY-> It's always add days
[06:03:27] <silv3r_m00n> depy: so ... ?
[06:03:28] <shoky> what
[06:03:42] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MZrSS/36/
[06:03:43] <depy> silv3r_m00n, no idea right now :)
[06:05:21] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Oh wait I see
[06:05:24] <fRAiLtY-> My bad soz
[06:05:47] <shoky> you just dont want to add 1 to the date if you're about to exit the loop & function
[06:06:51] <fRAiLtY-> shaky, 1 last thing, can you tell me how to format the date, in console.log it's a long winded date, I just want it short like DD MMMM
[06:09:10] <troydm> shoky: strange thing in fiddle it works
[06:09:18] <troydm> shoky: but on real page it doesn't :(
[06:09:34] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  ^^ I called you shaky by accident :x
[06:10:20] <shoky> fRAiLtY- well, you're already modifying the Date prototype so,
[06:10:38] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[06:11:05] <Nirvanko> Is it correct selector '.class1 class2 li:first div'?
[06:11:29] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MZrSS/37/
[06:12:16] <firedfox> Pantaloonix: when you call $("string"), if you would like to create new tags, the string must start with "<"
[06:12:36] <shoky> troydm: are you using a DOM ready handler..
[06:12:38] <fRAiLtY-> shaky console.log still returns long date :x
[06:12:57] <troydm> shoky: what do you mean by that?
[06:13:13] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: console.log( new Date().nextShipDate(5).myFormat() )
[06:13:19] <troydm> shoky: i can show you the real page
[06:13:31] <gaspyr> rohan did u get my suggestion in pm ?
[06:13:31] <troydm> shoky: i'm not too good with jquery
[06:13:42] <shoky> troydm: i mean did you surround your code with $(document).ready(function() { ... } )
[06:14:16] <shoky> troydm: ok link me..
[06:15:05] <shoky> Nirvanko: is it correct for what?
[06:16:03] <Nirvanko> shoky, guess for what, dumbass.
[06:16:17] <Nirvanko> In what channel you are.
[06:17:06] <shoky> :)
[06:17:11] <ajpiano> Nirvanko: watch your attitude, he meant "is it correct for what are you trying to select."
[06:18:02] * ajpiano leaves to get on a plane
[06:18:07] <Nirvanko> I've asked about the syntax, thought my question was obvious.
[06:18:12] <shoky> have a nice flight ajp
[06:18:29] <shoky> Nirvanko: there is nothing obvious about your question
[06:18:43] <ajpiano> shoky: take care of the place while i'm out will ya ;)
[06:18:52] <shoky> :) will do my best
[06:19:06] <shoky> oh my
[06:19:12] <shoky> thnx ;]
[06:19:18] <Nirvanko> You see snoky, I've helped yo to become an op, that does mean you wont ban me, right?
[06:19:40] <shoky> Nirvanko: we'll see won't we ;p
[06:19:46] <Nirvanko> )))

[06:20:20] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Is there an easy way of returning like 27th instead of 27
[06:20:26] <fRAiLtY-> adding the th/nd/rd etc

[06:28:54] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: donno offhand of an 'easy' way, i'd just use some lib if i needed to work with dates and format them a lot
[06:28:55] <Rovanion> Is it possible to translate 2em to px in the current context?
[06:29:35] <blackspotwiggins> shoky, fRAiLtY- it shouldnt be hard?
[06:29:43] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[06:29:45] <Rovanion> Since em is kindof a loose term
[06:29:46] <shoky> blackspotwiggins: of course not
[06:29:59] <blackspotwiggins> if last number==1 'st' elsif ==2 'nd' else 'rd'
[06:30:13] <shoky> blackspotwiggins: he was just looking for a shortcut i guess
[06:30:26] <blackspotwiggins> oh well
[06:30:41] <blackspotwiggins> shockingly, devs actually sometimes have to do their own code :)
[06:31:00] <shoky> silly devs
[06:31:00] <blackspotwiggins> but im sure someone will make a jquery plugin for it
[06:41:29] <jenia> hello everyone. i'm experiencing some difficulties:
[06:41:52] <jenia> the jqeury framework keeps triggering erros (DOM exceptions) in my browser
[06:41:53] <jenia> s
[06:42:20] <jenia> so the first error says: unknown property zoon, declaration dropped
[06:42:42] <jenia> juery-ui.1.8.21.custom.css
[06:42:53] <jenia> thats the file its in
[06:43:03] <jenia> did anyone experience this before?
[06:43:49] <Haprog> you mean "zoom" ?
[06:43:52] <Haprog> that's normal
[06:44:03] <jenia> yes
[06:44:07] <jenia> it is?
[06:44:56] <Haprog> that's a CSS "error" though, not a DOM exception
[06:45:55] <e-anima> i have some type prolem: http://jsfiddle.net/Nsde6/
[06:45:56] <Haprog> I think there are many css hacks for different browser in the jQuery UI css, so you don't really need to care about the CSS warnings/errors.
[06:46:08] <jenia> okay thanks
[06:46:36] <Haprog> if you get JS errors, then you need to start paying attention
[06:46:37] <e-anima> if i get the values with var country = $('.country').val(); it does never match the array if i manually do "AT" it works
[06:46:54] <e-anima> must be some typecast stuff
[06:47:47] <Haprog> e-anima: supply the html code also so we can see the problem in your fiddle
[06:49:07] <Haprog> e-anima: you want to populate the countries array from the DOM?
[06:49:29] <Haprog> or just get the country to find in the array?
[06:49:52] <Haprog> what do you have as the element with class "country"?
[06:50:46] <Aamir> e-anima: console.log your value so you know you are passing a valid string to the inArray method
[06:55:16] <Aamir> e-anima:  selected
[06:55:18] <Aamir> opps
[06:55:26] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/Nsde6/1/
[06:57:23] <e-anima> ok testing ..
[06:58:13] <e-anima> i am console log always
[06:59:00] <e-anima> http://pastebin.com/mZA7vbJA
[06:59:13] <e-anima> still getting this, everthing is wrong evebn if it is inside the array
[06:59:48] <Aamir> e-anima: .attr('value',i)
[06:59:56] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/Nsde6/2/
[07:00:26] <PigDude> new Array, ew
[07:00:43] <e-anima> better suggestion?
[07:00:55] <Aamir> e-anima: use []
[07:01:00] <Aamir> :)
[07:01:21] <e-anima> ok just like php
[07:02:24] <PigDude> e-anima, php is array()
[07:02:44] <e-anima> i meant similar because foo['bar'];
[07:02:53] <PigDude> e-anima, foo.bar
[07:03:09] <PigDude> e-anima, he meant, var a = [1, 2, 3], not new Array(1, 2, 3)
[07:03:27] <e-anima> yep, got it here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/#valuearray
[07:03:31] <rroelofs> e-anima:  javascript doesn't have associative arrays
[07:03:42] <NodeX> it has Json ;)
[07:03:49] <e-anima> i know, i shouldnt havent had mentioned php ^^
[07:03:51] <NodeX> same thing in simples
[07:04:05] <PigDude> {} is very much like array() in php
[07:04:17] <NodeX> it's practically the same aside a few differences
[07:04:26] <PigDude> yes, there is no prototype lookup mechanism
[07:04:37] <PigDude> but that is a fundamental language difference that is not isolated to {}
[07:05:40] <NodeX> e-anima: instead of [] do somehting like this ... var foo = { bar : "hi"}; .. this is the same as php array('bar'=>'hi');
[07:05:44] <rroelofs> and in php decoded json never gets you an assoc array
[07:05:59] <NodeX> rroelofs : it does, with the flag set ;)
[07:06:07] <NodeX> json_decode($bleh,true)
[07:06:12] <rroelofs> ok. you got me :-)
[07:09:38] <e-anima> NodeX what would be the advantage in this case using:  e-anima: instead of [] do somehting like this ... var foo = { bar : "hi"};
[07:09:43] <PigDude> rroelofs = new StdClass
[07:09:46] <e-anima> or was that just for info?
[07:09:51] <NodeX> for information
[07:22:18] <e-anima> is it that var foo= $('.country').val(); changes the type? and is different from just $('.country').val()
[07:22:24] <e-anima> i dont get that
[07:24:01] <jomofcw> Hello
[07:24:25] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the result of $(elem).css('marginTop') without any "px" thing ?
[07:25:28] <anew> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/ am i wrong that editing line 319 of jquery.validate.js type=password is the same as line 169 in the html ?
[07:26:56] <Zhy> jomofcw try parseInt(numberwithpixels);
[07:28:44] <fusion27> I've got an array that looks like this.  http://pastie.org/4160324 , say I have 7100, is the fastest way to get 'Art - Myers School of (7100)' out of the array to loop over it and compare the code I have with index0 and return index1?
[07:28:46] <boudga> hi all
[07:29:32] <boudga> http://jsfiddle.net/boudga/Kz6re/1/ I am wondering why safari doesn't hide these options but chrome and Firefox do
[07:30:56] <jomofcw> Zhy thanks it works ^^ !
[07:32:19] <Zhy> :) you're welcome ... here for further reading: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/395163/get-css-top-value-as-number-not-as-string -- becomes important if there might be values beginning with 0, then you should call parseInt(pixelvalue, 10)
[07:33:27] <e-anima> this is driving me crazy, basically both console.log should output the same value? http://jsfiddle.net/D2LLX/
[07:33:41] <e-anima> question is just about that
[07:34:24] <keirlav87> is anyone familiar with a message "SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'append' " in ie 9
[07:34:38] <NodeX> e-anima : no one will be the changed value
[07:34:43] <NodeX> one will be the value at runtime
[07:35:10] <NodeX> console.log("it is 2: " + jQuery.inArray(country, eu_countries)); <--- might never be run if it's not changed
[07:36:23] <CosmoSRO>  im looking for a scrolling carousel kinda thing for photos that slowly moves on its own....this here comes close but doesnt move... would it be easy to add the moving part to this sample code?
[07:36:29] <CosmoSRO> http://mistonline.in/wp/simple-jquery-image-slider/
[07:36:47] <jomofcw> could I return something in a binding function like $(elem).bind('foo',function(){return bar;}); please ?
[07:37:14] <e-anima> jea that wa smy problem, thx NodeX, now it works
[07:37:24] <NodeX> ;)
[07:37:37] <CosmoSRO> or is wahat i want to do really involved?
[07:38:31] <NodeX> jomofcw : as far as I remember binding always returns the jquery Object for chaining
[07:39:18] <jomofcw> NodeX yea sound logical :/
[07:39:43] <boudga> does display:none not work on options in safari?
[07:40:30] <Zhy> jomofcw you could create a variable outside of the bind and assign a return value in your bind function
[07:40:43] <jomofcw> Zhy hm OK thanks :).
[07:41:42] <Zhy> no problem :> dunno if that suits your needs but thought I'd mention it
[07:42:20] <CosmoSRO> does anyone have a few moments to help a complete noob?
[07:42:47] <raj> what's a good extension in chrome for developers, which includes turning js on and off?
[07:42:56] <raj> CosmoSRO, ask the question
[07:43:04] <CosmoSRO>  im looking for a scrolling carousel kinda thing for photos that slowly moves on its own....this here comes close but doesnt move... would it be easy to add the moving part to this sample code?
[07:43:08] <CosmoSRO> http://mistonline.in/wp/simple-jquery-image-slider/
[07:43:15] <CosmoSRO> or is what i want to do really involved?
[07:43:22] <CosmoSRO> i reposted raj
[07:44:40] <raj> CosmoSRO, it has autoscroll
[07:44:50] <CosmoSRO> oh
[07:44:57] <CosmoSRO> where is that raj?
[07:45:02] <CosmoSRO> the demo didnt
[07:45:33] <raj> auto:10
[07:45:42] <CosmoSRO> is it a line in the jquery example?
[07:45:45] <CosmoSRO> ahhh
[07:45:49] <CosmoSRO> thx so much
[07:46:39] <raj> np
[07:46:51] <raj> I haven't tried it, just presuming + a quick google search
[07:48:05] <CosmoSRO> the demo didnt scroll....but if after looking at the code that auto:10 line shud make iot work
[07:48:35] <CosmoSRO> if thats what you think...knowing jquery and all
[07:48:44] <anew> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/ mktsignup.js line 3 how does it know to display this message on type=password and not somewhere else ?
[07:50:08] <shoky> raj: i don't use it myself but i think noscript is the popular one
[07:50:37] <shoky> anew: it has nothing to do with type=password. it's the class="password" that is doing it
[07:51:25] <raj> holy shit
[07:51:38] <shoky> anew: that is the way to tell the validation plugin, that when it sees the class 'password' on an input, then it uses that callback that you supply it to check those inputs
[07:52:03] <shoky> ah noscript is firefox
[07:52:30] <anew> @shoky what i thought line 319 was definining the types..........so if it is class="password" that is doing it, how does it know to display the message on class=password ? the function on line 4 i dont see anywhere referring to class=password
[07:53:07] <shoky> anew: it is calling the validation plugin's addMethod method
[07:53:56] <anew> @shoky line 915 .. i dont see there anything about defining classes ?
[07:54:02] <shoky> anew: SO WHAT
[07:54:07] <shoky> anew: there are MANY OTHER LINES
[07:54:11] <shoky> anew: each one does something
[07:54:15] <CosmoSRO> hey raj, i had 2 people look at the demo...it doesnt autoscroll
[07:54:34] <CosmoSRO> r u sure auto:10 means to autoscroll?
[07:54:49] <shoky> anew: together they form .. a plugin. with methods that do stuff. so what if a certain line doesnt have what you're looking for
[07:55:03] <anew> @shoky yes but i dont see anywhere in the entire code how it knows it needs to display the message next to class="password" ??
[07:55:19] <shoky> anew: it displays the message next to the input that is not valid, DUH!
[07:55:30] <shoky> do you even understand what the plugin is for?!
[07:55:35] <CosmoSRO> nm raj...i found something
[07:55:37] <shoky> what are you trying to understand?!
[07:55:38] <CosmoSRO> thx
[07:55:57] <Renkineko> hi everybody :)
[07:56:13] <anew> @shoky lol ... yes but how does it know which one is not valid !!
[07:56:19] <microhaxo> Guys, i am using a onclicked="myjavascriptfunction();"  HOW can i get an instance of the button to go in with the onclicked call?
[07:56:22] <anew> which one and where the message goes
[07:56:26] <shoky> anew: BECAUSE IT CHECKS THEM. THAT IS WHAT THE PLUGIN IS FOR. TO VALIDATE FIELDS!
[07:56:31] <microhaxo> *reference
[07:56:40] <anew> rofl
[07:57:19] <shoky> i just caught myself talking out loud when typing that. never happens to me. i could picture myself strangling you while yelling it
[07:57:22] <shoky> :)
[07:57:25] <shoky> (sorry)
[07:57:36] <anew> lol i thought u were really pissed at me
[07:58:17] <shoky> i kinda am. you are stuck on the same thing for like a week now, not listening to us when we tell you to start with something simpler, because you obviously have no idea what anything in the code is about
[07:58:24] <Renkineko> I don't understand how to use the ":has" selector... If i do "$('#table_id>tr:has(.ttc)')", it doesn't get me anything, but if I just write "$('#table_id>tr')", there IS tr with "ttc" class inside :/
[07:58:42] <anew> @shoky i installed this on my own site and am trying to edit the methods on my own
[07:58:44] <Renkineko> I know I could use the "hasClass" but what is the purpose of :has ? :)
[07:58:48] <anew> so i can see how debugging it works here
[07:59:04] <shoky> anew: learn how to properly use the plugin before debugging it
[07:59:27] <anew> i see where the plugin defines what to do when fields are invalid... and i see in mktsignup the message it needs to display, i just dont get how they are tied together
[07:59:37] <shoky> don't try to understand how the plugin works
[07:59:40] <Brodingo_> Renkineko hasClass returns boolean, :has is for fitlering
[07:59:40] <anew> well iguess with addmethod
[07:59:41] <shoky> you are JUST NOT THERE yet
[07:59:58] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:00:02] <Renkineko> ok so I really need has, and why did it not work with my class ? T_T
[08:00:05] <anew> well say for example i downloaded this and needed to write mktsignup.js... i wouldnt have a clue
[08:00:23] <shoky> anew: the plugin has lots of pre-defined "methods" that it uses to validate fields with certain classes
[08:00:34] <shoky> anew: on top of that, you can also add methods of your own using addMethod , just like that page is doing
[08:00:37] <Renkineko> the strange thing is when I do ":not", it's good, I get the tr without the ttc class :/
[08:00:43] <anew> yeah addmethod seems to be the connection
[08:00:53] <Brodingo_> Renkineko its more like does this element have a child with .ttc
[08:01:05] <GreekFreak> I was looking at the .css() method and was curious: This adds css to the element, isn't that what unobtrusiveness was trying to avoid? I assume it's the only way that JS can add a new style, right?
[08:01:11] <shoky> anew: the plugin checks for inputs with class="password" (because that is the name of the method that was added) and validates them. if they are invalid it puts the error message next to them
[08:01:18] <Brodingo_> Renkineko if you just need the tr then just do tr.ttc
[08:01:19] <Renkineko> ok, si I should use "$(#table_id:has(.ttc)", right ?
[08:01:30] <Brodingo_> depends on what youre trying to select
[08:01:42] <Renkineko> ... Why didn't I try that before >.>
[08:01:48] <Renkineko> brb, trying it ^^
[08:02:01] <anew> mmmm
[08:02:02] <anew> good good
[08:02:07] <anew> i am starting to see
[08:02:28] <anew> btw why is it class=password and not type=password
[08:02:29] <Renkineko> yeah Brodingo_, it worked... I'm just a little tired I think...
[08:02:33] <Renkineko> Thank you very much :)
[08:02:36] <microhaxo> How can i make a FormCollection with jquery?
[08:02:38] <shoky> anew: because the plugin looks for classes, not types
[08:02:51] <shoky> anew: that is just how the plugin works, which you should know because you have read how to use the plugin, RIGHT
[08:03:16] <anew> i didnt see any documentation
[08:03:31] <davvblack> so has anyone gone through the steps of debugging an ember application in IE8?  it works fine in modern browsers
[08:03:33] <anew> but this is great, learning a lot
[08:03:34] <shoky> few days ago when i asked you if you read all the docs for the plugin, you said yes
[08:03:41] <davvblack> I get things like "  assertion failed: Emptying a view in the inBuffer state is not allowed and should not happen under normal circumstances. Most likely there is a bug in your application. This may be due to excessive property change notifications."
[08:04:33] <shoky> anew: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[08:04:42] <anew> @shoky yes i did read what i found on the site, but just did not see anything but a few lines
[08:04:47] <shoky> anew: the 'View Source' in that example is also an integral part of the documentation.
[08:05:14] <anew> view source? also isnt that link the jquery page not the guys site who wrote the plugin ?
[08:05:39] <shoky> anew: it is the link you get to when you click 'Documentation' in http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[08:06:18] <anew> ya i ended up there also
[08:06:26] <anew> ok i'm going to start writing my own plugin XDDDD
[08:06:39] <shoky> anew: i hope you're kidding :\
[08:06:49] <anew> ROFL
[08:06:59] <raj> is it possible to go back to the original html file for an element?
[08:07:14] <raj> I want to get the .html() of the original html file
[08:07:18] <raj> if that's possible
[08:07:42] <SoulRaven> hello
[08:07:51] <SoulRaven> anybody use dataTables plugin?
[08:08:09] <SoulRaven> i need help with some problems
[08:08:19] <SoulRaven> and i can't undestant way is not working right
[08:08:25] <shoky> raj: i dont think in JS you have access to the actual html file... just the DOM representation
[08:08:32] <raj> k
[08:08:50] <SoulRaven> i am try to make paging to work
[08:09:35] <SoulRaven> but when i count al lthe records in DB and populate the iTotalDisplayRecords and, iTotalRecords with records after filtering
[08:10:01] <SoulRaven> the paging buttons are not active, even if i have more rows that i have display initial
[08:10:03] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[08:11:52] <raj> shoky, I hate to bother you with the timer again, but I'm noticing an issue with calling 'stop' or 'reset'. Both will make the timer display 0:00 (which is the defaultOutput)
[08:13:17] <teewuane> SoulRaven: sorry, have never used it before, maybe someone else though?
[08:13:31] <raj> if it's stopped, it should just sit at the number it was last
[08:13:34] <SoulRaven> someone ?
[08:13:40] <SoulRaven> nobody:((
[08:13:59] <raj> and if it's reset, perhaps i can just provide an html string of what to have there
[08:14:33] <shoky> raj , 'reset' should reset it to 0, no?  and, i dont see it happening witih 'stop'..
[08:14:45] <teewuane> SoulRaven: are you doing anything custom like that would be bypassing a function in datatables that resets those buttons?
[08:14:48] <raj> as soon as I call stop, it does 0:00
[08:14:57] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/aSfEB/15/
[08:15:02] <raj> the clock is actually at 0
[08:15:13] <SoulRaven> teewuane: no, nothing
[08:15:23] <raj> cuz i stop+reset on page load
[08:15:43] <shoky> i dont understand
[08:15:47] <raj> (cuz there's a post on page load, and I do the stop+reset in the callback)
[08:15:59] <shoky> mmm , so?
[08:16:22] <raj> if I comment out the stop, it still shows a 0:00. if I comment out the reset, it still shows a 0:00. If I comment out both, it shows the original html 00:00:00)
[08:16:34] <SoulRaven> teewuane: if i populate both of params with the same lenght, i mean with the max records, then i have the active buttons for paging, but in this case the filtering will not work
[08:17:00] <raj> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/aSfEB/16/
[08:17:21] <shoky> mm what did you do
[08:17:33] <raj> I made the html show 00:00
[08:17:44] <raj> that's the only difference
[08:18:12] <imsky> shoky you're op now?
[08:18:17] <imsky> moving up!
[08:18:18] <raj> ballin'
[08:18:36] <teewuane> SoulRaven: this is a wild one but what happens if you call .dataTable() on the element again? just curious
[08:18:38] <shoky> :P
[08:18:49] <teewuane> seems that would reset things?
[08:19:32] <SoulRaven> teewuane: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/959245239
[08:19:35] <shoky> raj
[08:19:52] <shoky> so the issue is just how it displays the time?
[08:20:02] <shoky> you could just change the output function no?
[08:20:05] <shoky> add:  if (m < 10) m = "0" + m;
[08:20:48] <shoky> either in defaultOutput() if you're using it, or in your own callback
[08:21:04] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/aSfEB/17/
[08:21:15] <andi> Hi
[08:21:46] <raj> shoky, the output for timer1 is `0 seconds` which then changes to `X minutes Y seconds`
[08:21:54] <raj> timer2 uses 00:00:00
[08:22:19] <raj> the callbacks are fine for the actual timers
[08:22:48] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/PffLTX5LL2Nfy6qL8bzv3X
[08:22:52] <andi> I'd like to have a button which I could give a function with .click in a dom part which was reloaded via ajax. At the moment nothings happens on clicking ajax loaded buttons. Can somebody tell me what to do to get this work? Do I need to register the click handler to this element?
[08:23:08] <_Z3R0> anyone familiar with dataTables()  plugin ?
[08:23:31] <shoky> raj sry i still dont understand what you want to happen vs what is actually happening
[08:24:10] <raj> with the 'start' method, it's fine with the callback, it looks exactly as I want
[08:24:21] <nFFFF> Is there something syntaxically wrong with this handler: http://jsfiddle.net/hgGTy/
[08:24:22] <raj> but if I call 'stop' it makes it look like 0:00
[08:24:25] <nFFFF> its breaking all js on the page
[08:24:30] <toddWork_> i'm really struggling w/ async today: http://jsfiddle.net/fdTpk/
[08:24:30] <raj> same thing happens if I call 'reset'
[08:24:41] <toddWork_> so, how do i return that url so it will actually work?
[08:24:46] <shoky> raj, are you calling 'stop'/'reset'  before calling that 'start' that supplies the callback?
[08:25:06] <raj> yes
[08:25:13] <shoky> ok gotcha
[08:25:31] <shoky> remember at first i only made it so you supply the callback with .timer(callback)  at first init of the timer ?
[08:25:35] <shoky> that's why ;)
[08:25:46] <raj> aaah, I see
[08:26:37] <shoky> yey
[08:26:50] <raj> so how can this be resoluted?
[08:26:54] <raj> no, resolved
[08:26:59] <raj> that's more like english
[08:27:14] <shoky> on page load, call the timers.timer(callback) to initialize them
[08:27:28] <raj> oh, just callback without any method?
[08:27:30] <raj> cool
[08:27:34] <shoky> yeah
[08:27:41] <raj> nice
[08:27:49] <shoky> then you dont need to supply it when you 'start'
[08:27:53] <raj> and I can just call 'start' and it'll follow that callback?
[08:27:55] <shoky> unless you wanna change it
[08:27:56] <shoky> yeah
[08:27:56] <raj> beautiful
[08:27:58] <shoky> it saves it
[08:28:56] <raj> freaking lovely
[08:29:13] <raj> you should abstract this out a little and throw it on github as a resume builder ;)
[08:30:04] <shoky> well, you're still testing it :P
[08:30:32] <shoky> also EvilTwin did more than half of the work there ;p
[08:30:46] <_Z3R0> toddWork_:  you are calling the function but you're not outputting the data anywhere
[08:31:09] <_Z3R0> $('#div').html(myApp.getMyIp()); ?
[08:31:41] <_Z3R0> calling it directly is going to return the string, but you need to use the string somewhere O.o
[08:32:00] <shoky> toddWork_:  that 'return url' is only returning from the ajax success callback, not from getMYIP
[08:32:13] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ toddWork_
[08:32:13] <bot-t> toddWork_, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:32:15] <_Z3R0> shoky: I thought the same thing as well, but then how could he change that ?
[08:32:30] <shoky> he shouldn't rely on a return value from that function
[08:32:36] <shoky> he should do whatever he wants in the success callback
[08:32:58] <shoky> like what you suggested for example..
[08:33:05] <shoky> er sorry no
[08:33:09] <_Z3R0> but doing that inside it
[08:33:15] <shoky> thougth you were doing that in the callback, nm
[08:33:15] <_Z3R0> $('#div').html(url);
[08:33:19] <shoky> yeah^^
[08:34:08] <_Z3R0> but what if the function is simply meant to get a string.... I mean... what if you just wanted to use that function to get a string to use in another function
[08:34:15] <shoky> also a nicer way to deal with it is using deferreds, sec,
[08:34:33] <EyePulp> hrm… jquery + bootstrap tabs fail with ID attars containing dots?   http://jsfiddle.net/uJXb2/     is this a jquery thing (namespacing of some sort) or a bootstrap thing?  Or did I just fail basic html =)
[08:34:48] <EyePulp> *attrs
[08:35:31] <shoky> _Z3R0 & toddWork_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fdTpk/1/
[08:35:38] <shoky> er
[08:35:43] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: it's valid in html but not css
[08:35:49] <_Z3R0> EyePulp: you mean add class nav-tabs ?
[08:35:51] <_Z3R0> I'm confused
[08:35:52] <johnkpaul> in order to select for it, I think you need to escape it
[08:36:12] <johnkpaul> but EyePulp, I don't see any javascript on that fiddle
[08:36:20] <shoky> _Z3R0 & toddWork_:   more like http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fdTpk/2/
[08:37:11] <_Z3R0> shoky: that doesn't resolve the question though, my question is, how to simply return a string from an ajax response, I mean, what if you didn't need to use the string RIGHT then, or if you wanted to store it for later use
[08:37:29] <shoky> _Z3R0: you dont return stuff from an ajax response
[08:38:07] <shoky> _Z3R0: what's the problem with storing it for later use?
[08:38:08] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: none needed if you have bootstrap pulled in - it auto detects the data-toggle="tab"  on the <a>
[08:38:23] <_Z3R0> ok let's see if I can do this
[08:38:48] <shoky> _Z3R0 you don't make a function that returns a string that relies on an async ajax call
[08:38:52] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: added them under the Manage Resources to the left
[08:38:55] <shoky> _Z3R0: you just dont ;)
[08:39:00] <johnkpaul> ah I see EyePulp
[08:39:17] <_Z3R0> take a basic function with an argument myFunc(<val>) { switch(<val>) { case 1: return "string"; case 2: return "string2"; } // I mean that could be called and return a value, so I can't call an ajax request and get the same type of result ?
[08:39:26] <shoky> no
[08:39:36] <EyePulp> _Z3R0: I don't understand your question - clicking on the tabs in that fiddle will show you the essential issue.
[08:39:37] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: your markup does not match the bootstrap tabs
[08:39:45] <shoky> a switch() is synchronous. an ajax call is not
[08:39:56] <shoky> you use the callback, end of discussion
[08:39:59] <shoky> callback(s)
[08:40:14] <_Z3R0> but there's no js?
[08:40:16] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: how so?
[08:40:27] <johnkpaul> _Z3R0: there is js, look in manage resouces
[08:40:36] <_Z3R0> ah nice
[08:40:59] <nFFFF> shoky johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/48/ -> click an image and mvoe mouse, scrolls up and down perfect
[08:41:02] <EyePulp> sorry if that's the wrong place to put them - it is a bit obscure.
[08:41:05] <nFFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/48/show -> do same thing in this widnow
[08:41:06] <nFFFF> fuxored
[08:41:11] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: I'm pretty sure that you need .tab-pane
[08:41:11] <nFFFF> what gives?
[08:41:19] <johnkpaul> and href's with ids in them
[08:41:22] <nFFFF> Is the math wrong?
[08:41:37] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: I don't rally remember, I haven't used the tabs in a while, but that is definitely not all of the markup that you need
[08:41:42] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: I've got that on my content divs
[08:42:04] <EyePulp> and they all work, except when you have a "." in the ID
[08:42:14] <EyePulp> or at least they work for me on that fiddle =)
[08:42:31] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: none of the tabs work for me
[08:42:33] <johnkpaul> chrome 19, osx
[08:42:58] <EyePulp> Version 20.0.1132.43 beta  OSX ..  SUCK IT!  =)
[08:43:03] <EyePulp> kidding
[08:43:10] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:43:24] <EyePulp> I doubt it's a version issue.  odd that none of them are working for you.
[08:43:34] <johnkpaul> _Z3R0: are any of them working for you?
[08:43:37] <_Z3R0> nope
[08:43:46] <_Z3R0> but I have used bs before and they have worked
[08:44:00] <johnkpaul> none working on ff 13 either
[08:44:19] <_Z3R0> actually I lie
[08:44:23] <_Z3R0> even on their site they don't work
[08:44:28] <_Z3R0> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navs
[08:44:46] <EyePulp> http://jsfiddle.net/uJXb2/1/
[08:44:49] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: are you sure you sent us the right page http://jsfiddle.net/uJXb2/
[08:44:53] <_Z3R0> howevhowever
[08:44:54] <_Z3R0> however*
[08:44:56] <EyePulp> try again...
[08:44:59] <_Z3R0> the tabbable example does work
[08:45:01] <johnkpaul> :) EyePulp that's not what you sent us earlier
[08:45:16] <EyePulp> It was the one I was on, then I just did an update, and sent the new one
[08:45:26] <johnkpaul> ah, these have all of the right markupclasses EyePulp
[08:45:46] <_Z3R0> except the href for c.foo isn't working
[08:45:49] <EyePulp> my ignorance of jsfiddle is showing - when does it store changes?
[08:45:56] <_Z3R0> but I'm also assuming that suppose to be a function
[08:45:58] <_Z3R0> which doesn't exist ;)
[08:46:01] <EyePulp> only when you hit "update" ?
[08:46:02] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: when you click on update
[08:46:08] <EyePulp> doh
[08:46:19] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:46:22] <EyePulp> apologies - for some reason I thought it autosaved on each run
[08:46:47] <_Z3R0> ah lol I was wondering... ok
[08:46:48] <EyePulp> so a&b work fine, c does not, correct?
[08:46:54] <_Z3R0> so #c.foo = no worky
[08:47:00] <_Z3R0> why would you go to #c.foo ?
[08:47:06] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: yes, that is correct
[08:47:17] <johnkpaul> so in jQuery, if you need to select an id with a period, you need to escape it
[08:47:26] <johnkpaul> $("#c\\.foo")
[08:47:34] <johnkpaul> but I don't know how bootstrap handles that
[08:47:34] <EyePulp> _Z3R0: because it's there?
[08:47:47] <johnkpaul> I would remove the period, why do you need it?
[08:47:53] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: I gotcha - didn't realize that.
[08:47:58] <_Z3R0> and johnkpaul wins!
[08:48:04] <_Z3R0> seems to work on my run ;)
[08:48:40] <johnkpaul> EyePulp: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:48:45] <EyePulp> johnkpaul: obviously removal is the simple fix, it was just non-obvious, and the reason I decided to verify my hypothesis.  Education is better than guessing. =)
[08:48:48] <johnkpaul> read the second paragraph and it'll explain
[08:49:02] <johnkpaul> :) definitely, I'm very happy that you wanted to learn
[08:49:07] <johnkpaul> that's what we're here for
[08:49:46] <granden> is there something like append but that instead of appending it should replace the content of the element?
[08:49:50] <johnkpaul> and now I have to get to work, so I'm closing limechat
[08:49:54] <EyePulp> si

[08:51:42] <nFFFF> shoky, its not perfect though, it allows overscrolling
[08:53:13] <SoulRaven> anybody work with datatables?
[08:54:28] <Nece228> hello
[08:54:29] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/CZdKL/4/
[08:54:32] <Nece228> heres my table
[08:54:43] <e-anima> i am searching for a function taht allows me to run code if ANY form element is changed. i know about .change() but that seems to only work directly on input, select etc
[08:54:45] <Nece228> i want to animate rows
[08:54:55] <Nece228> but im not sure how to do it
[08:55:10] <Nece228> when i click on go up or go down
[08:55:13] <shoky> nFFFF: maybe, but at least it's much simpler to deal with now. just calculate the delta from the original mouse position
[08:55:30] <e-anima> problem is i have two form elements that if filled out correctly, will show an additional input
[08:55:37] <shoky> guess it's not a delta here tho, wrong term maybe
[08:56:23] <nFFFF> shoky, this is the hard part
[08:56:28] <nFFFF> I cant get it working properly
[08:57:17] <SoulRaven> i have some problems with datatables plugin, anybody use this plugin?
[08:57:33] <shoky> nFFFF why not just copy from whatever site it was that you showed a while ago ;p
[08:59:40] <nFFFF> shoky becuase thats admitting defeat
[08:59:54] <shoky> ;D
[09:00:12] <_Z3R0> anyone familiar with datatables plugin, having problems with some of the features :(
[09:00:14] <nFFFF> this sure beats the fizzbuzz challenge
[09:02:32] <lie2815> hello. i have a hover handler which i bind to every span.class element. when i dynamically add another span.class node to the dom tree, the binding won't get applied. how can i get around that?
[09:04:29] <lie2815> oh, never mind.
[09:05:29] <_Z3R0> DataTables question: http://jsfiddle.net/TM3gb/ // Using the "full_numbers" setup they offer, First, Previous, Next, Last do not function, but the numbers themselves do O.o
[09:07:33] <_Z3R0> even without "full_numbers" I can't seem to get the NEXT button to work O.o
[09:09:13] <Nece228> so id of certain element is numeric
[09:09:25] <Nece228> i want to increase or decrease it by one on certain action
[09:09:30] <Nece228> for example i have
[09:09:38] <SoulRaven> nobody use datatables plugin?
[09:09:45] <Nece228> $(this).attr(id, ++)
[09:09:49] <nFFFF> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/nAdsy/58/
[09:09:49] <_Z3R0> apparently not lol
[09:09:56] <Nece228> thats what i want
[09:10:00] <Nece228> how to do this?
[09:10:07] <_Z3R0> my problem seems to be if I use anything less than the default 10 rows shown, then next no longer functions
[09:10:10] <Nece228> i basically want to increment the id by one
[09:10:58] <_Z3R0> $(this).attr('id', ($(this).attr('id'))++); ?
[09:11:43] <_Z3R0> might be without the encapsulating ()
[09:11:43] <silverwind> Good luck incrementing a string
[09:11:58] <_Z3R0> ah right lol
[09:12:19] <Nece228> _Z3R0: thanks ill try
[09:12:26] <_Z3R0> like silverwind said, probably won't work
[09:12:31] <_Z3R0> unless you can convert the string to int
[09:12:45] <silverwind> You can with + or parseInt
[09:13:09] <silverwind> ?eval [+"10", parseInt("10", 10)];
[09:13:11] <bot-t> silverwind: [10, 10]
[09:13:11] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/TM3gb/2/ // works fine with default (10 rows shown) but if I force 5 rows shown it fails :( sigh
[09:14:04] <varnie> good day
[09:14:30] <varnie> what is better way of getting all fooId and barId items presented there: http://jsfiddle.net/MhKGq/
[09:14:31] <_Z3R0> in reality, I really just need a good pagination plugin, I just have used datatables before, so if anyone knows of something for just pagination that would be great :) although I didn't like jPaginate
[09:15:32] <_Z3R0> are they always going to be in numerical order?
[09:15:34] <varnie> each fooId has the appropriate barId.
[09:15:49] <varnie> are you about that "1", "2" etc values?
[09:15:53] <_Z3R0> because you could just count / 2 and use a for loop 0 -> X
[09:16:10] <varnie> _Z3R0, are you talking with me? :)
[09:16:12] <_Z3R0> yea
[09:16:15] <varnie> 8-)
[09:16:59] <varnie> could you be more detailed please?
[09:17:14] <silverwind> $('input[name^="foo"], input[name^="foo"]') ?
[09:17:16] <e-anima> this is driving me insane. i want to monitor two fields and if one changes display a third. i just cant get the monitoring to work. i think i put mouseMove in, sucks but works
[09:17:35] <_Z3R0> one sec
[09:19:19] <shoky> nFFFF: cool
[09:20:39] <varnie> basically, to get all fooIds and their corresponding barIds I have to use two jquery selectors. are there any better approach?
[09:23:45] <_Z3R0> 2 selectors?
[09:24:01] <PigDude> e-anima, just use keyup event on either field?
[09:24:13] <e-anima> one is a select
[09:24:16] <e-anima> thats the problem
[09:24:24] <PigDude> e-anima, use the 'change' event then
[09:24:38] <e-anima> that only works if you klick outside of an input
[09:24:44] <PigDude> ?
[09:24:48] <e-anima> the conditional field triggers are and input+ a select
[09:24:51] <varnie> _Z3R0, I meant, I have to retrieve all fooIds and barIds separately.
[09:24:59] <varnie> is it so?
[09:25:01] <PigDude> change will be fired whenever a different OPTION is selected
[09:25:09] <PigDude> whether by keyboard or mouse
[09:25:53] <e-anima> PigDude yes. but, on the input change troggers only on dis-focus of the input
[09:26:11] <e-anima> or am i misinformed
[09:26:19] <Ring0`> Hi. How can I print `comment` without using append? http://jsfiddle.net/p36kt/
[09:26:22] <PigDude> e-anima, so listen on keyup and check if e.target is the select
[09:26:32] <Ring0`> clone() returns jQuery but how do I take it's `value`?
[09:26:42] <e-anima> keyup will not cover the select :)
[09:27:00] <e-anima> or you mean change and inside keyup
[09:27:02] <PigDude> e-anima, keyup event is valid for just about any element. try it yoruself
[09:27:58] <PigDude> Ring0`, value?
[09:28:00] <e-anima> i am confused, keyup is triggered bykeyboard, select is selected with mouse
[09:28:23] <Ring0`> PigDude: well i mean i want to insert this whole <textarea> right after 'test'
[09:28:32] <Ring0`> in the example which i shown but without using append
[09:28:43] <Ring0`> rather: comments.somethinghere() ?
[09:29:34] <granden> is it possibly to stack .parent()? like $(this).parent().parent() would that return the parent of the parent to $(this)?
[09:29:35] <PigDude> e-anima, e-anima perhaps you can update this to show what you are doing: http://jsfiddle.net/d8xKY/
[09:29:44] <j_ayen_green> I have a third-party js file that checks on a link click for a value having been set, and if so, passes it. If I set the onclick text in the html, it works. if i set it in jquery with .click or .attr, it does not. I sense a timing issue but can't figure out why
[09:30:28] <al_2000> hi, would anyone mind helping me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/5LNJw/
[09:30:28] <lancealtar> Ring0`: http://jsfiddle.net/p36kt/1/
[09:30:33] <PigDude> Ring0`, where did you show your example?
[09:30:40] <al_2000> For some reason I cant seem to drop down the info TD
[09:30:55] <al_2000> I have multiple fieldset/tables that i want this function to work for
[09:31:04] <Ring0`> lancealtar: nope, i wanted to clone textarea.
[09:31:13] <Ring0`> PigDude: http://jsfiddle.net/p36kt/
[09:31:20] <PigDude> al_2000, you can't use tables to do that
[09:31:23] <PigDude> al_2000, as far as i know
[09:31:31] <PigDude> al_2000, it's a limitation of how tables are rendered
[09:31:43] <al_2000> oh.. so i would have to just put a div after the table/td?
[09:31:49] <al_2000> can I do it with a div inside of the table?
[09:32:38] <lancealtar> Ring0`: You want to clone textarea, which you have accomplished. What else are you attempting to do?
[09:32:39] <PigDude> Ring0`, i probably don't understand what you want. is this it? http://jsfiddle.net/p36kt/2/
[09:33:03] <e-anima> PigDude: http://jsfiddle.net/d8xKY/6/ so now if the user selects "2" and inputs a name, hidden field shows up. if changes selection or then deletes input, field hides again
[09:33:15] <Ring0`> no.. As you see if I use + comment it will display object Object, if I append it, it shows correctly
[09:33:23] <Ring0`> I want it to work without using append
[09:33:29] <Ring0`> so it shows right next to 'test'
[09:33:38] <Eviltwin> raj: The seconds -> text logic it typically done like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gKPeL/
[09:33:54] <PigDude> Ring0`, + invokes toString(o)
[09:33:54] <Eviltwin> raj: Because it scales better for larger units (like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gKPeL/1/ )
[09:34:00] <PigDude> Ring0`, on non-string operands
[09:34:10] <PigDude> Ring0`, toString({}) is [object Object], as with many other objects
[09:34:31] <PigDude> Ring0`, if jQuery.prototype.toString() were implemented, you'd see that value
[09:34:37] <Ring0`> yep so there comes my question, is there workaround?
[09:34:43] <Ring0`> oh.
[09:34:48] <PigDude> don't use it as a string if you don't want to
[09:34:50] <PigDude> or implement toString()
[09:34:52] <PigDude> for that
[09:34:59] <Ring0`> ok thanks!
[09:35:23] <al_2000> PidDude do you mind if I pm you for a second?
[09:35:51] <al_2000> been trying to figure this out for a few hrs now
[09:35:53] <PigDude> Ring0`, sure thing. to see for yourself, do var o = {}; alert('b' + o); o.toString = function() { return 'a'; }; alert('b' + o)
[09:36:01] <PigDude> Ring0`, in the second case you'll see "ba"
[09:36:09] <PigDude> Ring0`, in the first, "b[Object object]"
[09:36:24] <PigDude> al_2000, ok
[09:39:52] <lancealtar> PigDude: Thanks for explaining that, TIL. :-)
[09:40:05] <raj> Eviltwin, holy cow that is clean

[09:43:11] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/1/ - How would I acctually do that? I would like it to when clicking "Click here" it should take the first coloumn for that <tr> and enter it in the blue box and the second value in the green box.
[09:43:28] <_Z3R0> lol that's what I was working on
[09:44:05] <MichMich> Hi all...
[09:44:07] <granden> _Z3R0: You tried doing the exact same thing?
[09:45:03] <granden> how to acctually add the value I know, but its the operation to get it I dont understand how to do.
[09:45:21] <_Z3R0> well, I'm not as experienced as him, but it was what I was going for
[09:45:23] <_Z3R0> for him
[09:46:36] <raj> Eviltwin, that is totally beautiful
[09:46:41] <Nece228> how to select previous <td>?
[09:47:17] <_Z3R0> .prev() ?
[09:47:36] <Nece228> hmm not sure if thats what i need, lemme try
[09:47:49] <_Z3R0> .prev('td')
[09:48:12] <e-anima> PigDude any hint on that fiddle?
[09:48:26] <PigDude> e-anima, going on lunch sorry :^\
[09:48:33] <e-anima> ah k, have fun
[09:49:18] <granden> if I got a <table> in my selector, how would I select a certain <tr> based on it index value?
[09:49:24] <raj> Eviltwin, I thought JS god's have deemed 2 space indents?
[09:49:31] <raj> *gods
[09:49:42] <Eviltwin> Yeah but jsFiddle has deemed 4-space indents for the prettifier
[09:50:01] <Eviltwin> In my own editor I use 2-space
[09:50:18] <raj> oh duh, right
[09:50:21] <_Z3R0> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/2/ ?
[09:51:53] <navaismo> Hi, I'm a newbie using jquery. I have a table and i add a button to delete the register of that table, but the click function only work for the first row, in the others rows the button do nothing.
[09:51:54] <granden> _Z3R0: NICE! Thanks a lot. Is it possible to as well remove the tr after the Click here have been clicked?
[09:52:02] <navaismo> this the code http://pastebin.com/dfHL9gNp
[09:52:06] <_Z3R0> well, I can't get the second column using that same thing
[09:52:18] <_Z3R0> nevermind: http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/3/
[09:52:18] <granden> oh
[09:52:35] <MichMich> Nece228: how do you do your selection? by id, or by class?
[09:52:47] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/4/
[09:52:49] <MichMich> navaismo: how do you do your selection? by id, or by class?
[09:52:50] <granden> _Z3R0: Really nice
[09:53:04] <MichMich> Nece228: sorry, wrong username.
[09:53:11] <granden> _Z3R0: using hide is it gone from the dom then?
[09:53:20] <_Z3R0> iono, I just knew it would hide it lol
[09:53:20] <granden> no way to retrive it?
[09:53:27] <_Z3R0> you can use show() again to see it
[09:53:33] <_Z3R0> maybe /
[09:53:53] <_Z3R0> since they don't have id's that specify them, I don't know if you could retrieve it back
[09:54:20] <granden> _Z3R0: I dont want to be able to :)
[09:54:26] <granden> Just want to make shure they should be gone :)
[09:54:30] <_Z3R0> well there ya go lol
[09:54:38] <navaismo> MichMich, I use a class to apply the style to the button and then use the ID to execute the click function in that fucntion i load the value for the row
[09:54:43] <granden> Thanks a lot!
[09:55:05] <_Z3R0> kinda surprised it worked to be honest... I suck at this stuff
[09:55:18] <MichMich> you can only select 1 item, id's must be unique. maybe thats it, navaismo?
[09:56:05] <navaismo> this is what i have http://pastebin.com/dfHL9gNp
[09:56:13] <MichMich> let me check
[09:56:52] <navaismo> Im really really new to this let says the last 24hours
[09:57:26] <MichMich> yes, thats the reason... they all have the id 'delid'. You should only use an ID once.
[09:57:34] <navaismo> ok
[09:57:42] <MichMich> let me check to see if i can fix it for you
[09:57:52] <navaismo> thanlk you
[09:58:58] <granden> _Z3R0: Wanna step it up a little bit :)
[09:59:04] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/6/ - It should acctually be like that
[09:59:19] <granden> but only showing the nummeric value in the boxes :)
[09:59:49] <MichMich> navaismo: all based on non tested guesses...
[10:00:13] <MichMich> change line 10: $("#delid") ----> $(".delid")
[10:00:39] <navaismo> ok let me see
[10:00:44] <MichMich> change line 28:  id='delid' ----> class='delid'
[10:01:45] <navaismo> wow
[10:01:50] <navaismo> it works
[10:01:55] <navaismo> thank you
[10:02:21] <navaismo> so # is for id and the . for classes
[10:02:26] <_Z3R0> ah fun...
[10:02:30] <_Z3R0> so you want to split the string ?
[10:02:46] <MichMich> yes, and in valid html, an id is unique, a class can be used multiple times.
[10:03:04] <granden> _Z3R0: Pretty much yes, but parseInt did what I wanted as well.
[10:03:18] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/fDT7W/7/
[10:03:26] <_Z3R0> ah yea
[10:03:26] <granden> Or is there any better way?
[10:03:41] <_Z3R0> nah that's probably better
[10:03:45] <_Z3R0> than using substr
[10:04:34] <granden> _Z3R0: Ok, great then :)
[10:04:36] <granden> Thanks again
[10:04:55] <navaismo> i appreciate your help MichMich
[10:05:16] <MichMich> you're welcome. let me know if you need more help.
[10:07:21] <navaismo> thanks
[10:07:24] <t4nkd> How do I change the CSS properties for an element's pseudo select(like, active or hover)
[10:09:24] <_Z3R0> element:hover ?
[10:09:44] <_Z3R0> element.whatever:hover ?
[10:10:24] <_Z3R0> btw guys, I figured out my dataTables problem... it needed an Integer I was using '5' and not 5 haha ;)
[10:10:45] <tippenein> http://jsfiddle.net/KBGmJ/1/ I'm getting Object has no method 'dialog' on a helptext element
[10:10:56] <t4nkd> Hrm, okay, I will try this
[10:11:25] <_Z3R0> isn't dialog in jquery-ui ?
[10:12:16] <tippenein> no idea, but I'll try that quick
[10:12:51] <lancealtar> tippenein: http://jsfiddle.net/KBGmJ/2/
[10:13:13] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/KBGmJ/3/
[10:13:15] <_Z3R0> there
[10:13:22] <_Z3R0> you also didn't have a <body> tag so it couldn't append to anything
[10:13:42] <_Z3R0> ok it's not dependent on ui, but you didn't have hte body tag
[10:14:08] <_Z3R0> nevermind, yes jquery-ui
[10:14:09] <tippenein> that is just a snippet from the full html
[10:14:17] <_Z3R0> also be careful though
[10:14:25] <_Z3R0> because that link will allow you to click it over and over nad over
[10:15:36] <granden> is there any selector for a link, <a href=""> with a certain href? Like <a href="#foo"> ?
[10:15:47] <granden> so when that gets pressed I wanna execute some jquery code
[10:16:09] <tippenein> alright, I'll keep that in mind, but jquery-ui-1.8.15.custom.min.js didn't help
[10:17:31] <lancealtar> granden: Take a look at http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[10:18:14] <_Z3R0> id ?
[10:18:17] <tippenein> _Z3R0: thanks, now I can at least see what it looks like in the jsfiddle
[10:18:23] <_Z3R0> np
[10:18:31] <lancealtar> granden: $('a[href="#foo"]').click();
[10:18:47] <_Z3R0> anyone done any styling (css) with dataTable plugin ? can't figure out how to change the code
[10:19:25] <granden> lancealtar: Cool, thanks!
[10:20:02] <granden> lancealtar: Then it wont acctuly open that link ?
[10:20:08] <granden> or will it try to do that as well then?
[10:21:20] <lancealtar> granden: If you would like it to prevent from opening that link, you do something like $('a[href="#foo"]').click(function () { return false; });
[10:21:29] <_Z3R0> click(function(e) { e.preventDevault(); // do jquery stuff }
[10:21:36] <_Z3R0> preventDefault*
[10:21:55] <_Z3R0> or simply return false; really your preference
[10:21:56] <lancealtar> granden: _Z3R0 has the preferred method
[10:22:19] <_Z3R0> the preventDefault() I like more, because you can put that right at the top, rather than return false; where you have to make sure it's outside of everything
[10:22:30] <tippenein> turns out I was importing it 2x because of a block header-hook in the django template
[10:22:36] <_Z3R0> ah
[10:22:38] <tippenein> it didn't like that
[10:22:46] <_Z3R0> fun stuff ;)
[10:23:01] <tippenein> yuppers
[10:23:05] <_Z3R0> gotta love view-source lol
[10:23:10] <_Z3R0> trying to figure out all this css crap
[10:23:12] <lancealtar> _Z3R0: good point about preventDefault()
[10:23:15] <tippenein> best debug
[10:23:36] <granden> Thanks!
[10:23:39] <_Z3R0> yea lancealtar I used to use return false, but then I always had problems when trying to figure out where to actually place the return
[10:25:29] <granden> _Z3R0: Copied your stuff, e.preventDefault() but it is still added to the url
[10:25:30] <granden> the #foo
[10:25:41] <_Z3R0> yes
[10:25:45] <_Z3R0> that will happen with #foo
[10:26:04] <phishbot> how far is UCSF from the Mission BART station?
[10:26:04] <_Z3R0> rather than using the href as indentifier you could use an ID
[10:26:06] <_Z3R0> and href=''
[10:26:11] <granden> ah
[10:26:12] <_Z3R0> to stop it from showing the url change
[10:26:12] <granden> ok
[10:26:28] <granden> or rather a class, as it will be used a lot.
[10:26:33] <_Z3R0> well
[10:26:35] <_Z3R0> of course ;)
[10:26:42] <granden> hmm
[10:26:54] <granden> trying to implement that jsfiddle you helped me with.
[10:27:06] <granden> got a bit of a problem :)
[10:27:11] <_Z3R0> well let's see it ;)
[10:27:12] <granden> but I shall make it!
[10:29:09] <granden> _Z3R0: Doh, the href='' reloaded the current page
[10:29:19] <_Z3R0> did you use e.preventDefault() ?
[10:29:22] <_Z3R0> if not, it will ;)
[10:30:20] <granden> sorry no jsFiddle but this is how it looks
[10:30:20] <granden> http://pastebin.com/ECANuUKc
[10:30:46] <granden> and the link is <a href="" class="varukorgTextTabort">
[10:30:54] <_Z3R0> and that made the link refresh the page?
[10:31:04] <granden> Yes
[10:31:17] <tippenein> lulwhut.. now it doesn't work again
[10:31:24] <granden> maybe I should use an div, containing the thing that should be a link
[10:31:29] <_Z3R0> look at your code
[10:31:34] <lancealtar>  granden what happens when you remove the preventDefault() and place return false; at the very bottom of the function?
[10:31:40] <tippenein> I don't think view source will save me this time
[10:31:42] <_Z3R0> class="varukorgTextTabort">  //  $('a[class="varukorgTextTaBort"]').click(function(e) {
[10:31:48] <_Z3R0> there's a CAPITAL B
[10:32:03] <_Z3R0> abort != aBort
[10:32:35] <granden> _Z3R0: Thats just me.
[10:32:38] <granden> I did not copy paste it
[10:32:41] <granden> I wrote it
[10:32:52] <_Z3R0> do what lancealtar suggested right quick
[10:32:53] <granden> its the exactly the same in the code
[10:33:02] <_Z3R0> remove the preventDefault() line and at the bottom add return false;
[10:33:05] <granden> lancealtar: Tried it, does not work.
[10:33:09] <_Z3R0> O.o
[10:33:15] <lancealtar> something else is wrong...
[10:33:27] <_Z3R0> <li class="icn_new_article"><a href="" data-url="admin/new_article" data-blog_id="0" class="sidebar_link">New Article</a></li> // my links work ;)
[10:33:27] <granden> http://a45.se/retursacken/index.html
[10:33:33] <lancealtar> You'll have to share more code in order for us to help.
[10:33:50] <granden> this is the page, needs safari,chrome or firefox latest build to run good.
[10:33:54] <_Z3R0> do I click Boka Hammer or Ball Sac ?
[10:34:01] <granden> Last one
[10:34:15] <granden> sorry it is in swedish :(
[10:34:30] <_Z3R0> what's "last one"
[10:34:33] <granden> you will have to choose one from 1 2 3
[10:34:42] <lancealtar> lol
[10:35:00] <_Z3R0> ya got it
[10:35:08] <_Z3R0> ok so 1,2,3 => Lag Until => (x) button
[10:35:12] <granden> _Z3R0: the latter of those you asked which to click.
[10:35:19] <granden> Yes
[10:35:26] <granden> but not the one in the top corner
[10:36:33] <lancealtar> granden: I'm clicking on things under 1, 2 and 3 and it isn't changing URLs
[10:36:45] <granden> lancealtar: No but then press Lägg Till
[10:36:50] <granden> and ater that you will get a new page
[10:36:51] <lancealtar> I did
[10:36:52] <granden> and an X
[10:37:08] <granden> its that (x) that is not working
[10:37:11] <lancealtar> granden: it showed a total
[10:37:13] <granden> and not the (x) in the top right corner.
[10:37:15] <lancealtar> OH
[10:37:17] <lancealtar> k
[10:37:30] <granden> lancealtar: Ta bort = remove
[10:37:39] <granden> trying to remove one line and updating the total
[10:37:47] <lancealtar> granden: right, ok
[10:38:05] <_Z3R0> uh
[10:38:08] <_Z3R0> you sure the href="" ?
[10:38:23] <_Z3R0> yea it does ok
[10:38:27] <lancealtar> ...
[10:38:30] <_Z3R0> because it shows the index.php page, as mine does
[10:38:37] <_Z3R0> viewing the source is very complicated though lol
[10:38:40] <lancealtar> change your class from #varukorgTextTaBort to varukorgTextTaBort
[10:38:44] <lancealtar> and try again
[10:38:52] <lancealtar> that's gotta be it
[10:39:14] <lancealtar> on the element itself you have the class as #varukorgTextTaBort
[10:39:18] <granden> woops!
[10:39:49] <_Z3R0> ha
[10:39:52] <_Z3R0> I couldn't find the damn element
[10:39:52] <granden> hmm, nope
[10:40:01] <_Z3R0> granden:
[10:40:04] <granden> its added using jquery append :)
[10:40:05] <lancealtar> _Z3R0: i love right-click->find element
[10:40:07] <_Z3R0> instead of a[class='blah']
[10:40:14] <lancealtar> oops, I mean inspect
[10:40:20] <_Z3R0> do ('a .younsdfas')
[10:40:27] <_Z3R0> or w/e that word is
[10:40:38] <granden> :)
[10:41:03] <lancealtar> granden:  you're using $('a[class="blah"]') when you should be finding the element with $('a.className')
[10:41:30] <_Z3R0> yea
[10:41:50] <granden> lancealtar: Changde to that
[10:41:59] <_Z3R0> lancealtar: is it ('a.name') or ('a .name')  ?
[10:42:01] <_Z3R0> or does that matter?
[10:42:03] <granden> a.varukorgTextTaBort and it still refreshes the pace.
[10:42:13] <granden> using the space as well.
[10:42:14] <granden> tried both
[10:42:30] <_Z3R0> uhmmm
[10:42:33] <_Z3R0> don't know if this is a problem
[10:42:36] <_Z3R0> but you have href=" "
[10:42:38] <_Z3R0> remove hte space?
[10:43:00] <granden> did it
[10:43:04] <granden> still refreshes :)
[10:43:14] <lancealtar> _Z3R0: I'm pretty sure the latter will look for a decendent with a class .name
[10:43:24] <_Z3R0> granden: are you editting live ?
[10:43:32] <_Z3R0> so we can refresh the src?
[10:43:33] <granden> _Z3R0: Yes
[10:43:35] <granden> yes
[10:43:51] <lancealtar> granden: your class is now class="remove"
[10:43:57] <_Z3R0> ah
[10:43:58] <_Z3R0> I know why
[10:44:05] <_Z3R0> all about scope...
[10:44:10] <lancealtar> no it isn't... nvm
[10:44:26] <granden> lancealtar: Removed that anyway now.
[10:44:38] <_Z3R0> $('a .sdfjkalsfjklsad') doesn't exist when the click function is applied
[10:44:44] <lancealtar> granden: change click to live('click', function
[10:44:53] <_Z3R0> change that to $('a .asjfklasjflksad).live('click', function(e) { // stuff });
[10:45:01] <lancealtar> _Z3R0: lol, love the asdfadsafw
[10:45:04] <granden> lol, are you the same guy?
[10:45:11] <granden> both giving the same test case :)
[10:45:13] <lancealtar> great minds, granden
[10:45:16] <granden> ah!
[10:45:20] <_Z3R0> I had this problem before when using includes with php
[10:45:22] <_Z3R0> and .load()
[10:45:31] <_Z3R0> the .click gets applied on everything CURRENT in teh dom
[10:45:36] <_Z3R0> but doesn't "applyl" to anything add
[10:45:37] <_Z3R0> ed*
[10:45:47] <_Z3R0> the live attaches to all ;)
[10:46:11] <granden> worked!
[10:46:14] <granden> Thanks alot!
[10:46:21] <_Z3R0> time to remove me a ball sac
[10:46:25] <lancealtar> haha
[10:46:32] <granden> _Z3R0: HAHA
[10:46:40] <_Z3R0> it did work yay!
[10:46:48] <granden> BALL SAC = Bestäl Säck = Order bag
[10:46:52] <_Z3R0> even updated my total to 0 koreans

[10:47:31] <tippenein> vim is a tricky bitch of a mistress
[10:47:43] <_Z3R0> I'm still busy trying to do all my views before I even start on the js for my admin panel lol
[10:47:52] <_Z3R0> and let me tell you, there are A LOT of views to do
[10:48:01] <tippenein> <3 views
[10:48:05] <granden> :)
[10:48:09] <granden> Doh!
[10:48:12] <granden> One problem left haha
[10:48:27] <granden> But havent looked into it, might be able to solve it myself.
[10:48:48] <_Z3R0> well we'll be here ;)
[10:49:20] <granden> If adding more then one stuff to the basket
[10:49:22] <granden> then removing
[10:49:28] <granden> it does not remove the white line.
[10:49:29] <granden> haha
[10:49:55] <granden> Ah now it works :)
[10:50:50] <_Z3R0> I didn't know, didn't wanna fill my ball sac too much lol
[10:51:14] <_Z3R0> you should really use custom scrollers lol
[10:51:17] <_Z3R0> that makes your page look horrid
[10:51:47] <granden> haha :)
[10:51:57] <granden> havent seen the page on any browser that shows scrollbars :)
[10:52:03] <granden> on any browser :)
[10:52:08] <granden> now just working in chrome and safari on mac
[10:52:13] <granden> not showing scrollbars lol.
[10:52:18] <_Z3R0> add more than 4 items
[10:52:23] <_Z3R0> chrome adds scrollsbars for me ;)
[10:52:23] <granden> yes not showing anyway
[10:52:26] <granden> on mac?
[10:52:29] <_Z3R0> no
[10:52:33] <granden> Probably that.
[10:52:40] <granden> because I dont get any.
[10:52:49] <granden> could you give me a screenshot of it? ;)
[10:53:02] <lancealtar> granden: do you use Lion?
[10:53:06] <granden> will try firefox
[10:53:09] <granden> see if it shows
[10:53:10] <granden> lancealtar: Yes
[10:53:20] <lancealtar> granden: Lion hides scrollbars by default.
[10:53:44] <_Z3R0> http://i.imgur.com/lEFRK.png
[10:54:22] <lancealtar> granden: check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6863748/lion-like-scrollbar-with-jquery
[10:54:26] <granden> damn it adds a scrollbar on the horizontal ass well :)
[10:54:36] <_Z3R0> well the horizontal is an easy fix
[10:54:38] <phishbot> tha'ts ugly
[10:54:40] <_Z3R0> because you can css that off
[10:54:49] <phishbot> overflow-y: hidden
[10:54:54] <_Z3R0> mmhmm ;)
[10:55:06] <_Z3R0> no y, x
[10:55:18] <granden> overflow-x:hidden; I need the horizontal scroll-bar :)
[10:55:22] <granden> no
[10:55:23] <_Z3R0> why ?
[10:55:23] <granden> vertical haha
[10:55:28] <phishbot> woops -x
[10:55:32] <_Z3R0> yea, you need the vert, hide x, keep y
[10:55:36] <granden> yes
[10:55:36] <phishbot> yeah
[10:55:37] <_Z3R0> but in reality, you can hide y too
[10:55:43] <granden> and use lancealtar jquery link to style it :)
[10:55:45] <_Z3R0> and then scroll the div, with custom buttons :)
[10:56:13] <granden> But that link lancealtar gave would be pretty awesome as well :)
[10:56:35] <_Z3R0> ;)
[10:56:38] <granden> lol the first link with the plugin is dead haha
[10:56:41] <_Z3R0> haha

When an image is clicked - its shows a gallery of images for that category. Then I just click it again to close that gallery. My issue is how can I close the current open item IF the user clicks on a new category to see a NEW gallery.

[11:17:58] <sacho> which is just css3 transforms actually
[11:18:36] <Mukta> as soon the node of the treeview is blurred.. it looses its focus
[11:19:15] <Mukta> at the next moment what you could view is
[11:19:40] <Mukta> some other node of the treeview gets focus..
[11:19:54] <Mukta> Could you please provide the technical guide..
[11:19:56] <Mukta> as in
[11:19:56] <_Z3R0> question guys, can one click function call the click function of another ?
[11:20:23] <Mukta> How could I retain the focus to the selected node on the treeview
[11:21:10] <Mukta> Anyone.. Help please
[11:22:44] <shoky> _Z3R0: any function can call any other (named) function
[11:22:46] <gnarf> ?demo @Mukta
[11:22:47] <bot-t> Mukta, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:23:00] <_Z3R0> right, but it's not a NAMED function
[11:23:04] <shoky> then no.
[11:23:04] <gnarf> not that even if you provided a demo of the issue I would have the time to look into it, but we can't just "air debug"
[11:23:14] <shoky> but any anonymous function can be turned into a named one
[11:23:23] <gnarf> someone else might be more inclined to help if they can see the problem
[11:23:25] <gaspyr> zzhe is using anonymous functions on event handlers
[11:23:33] <shoky> he doesn't have to
[11:23:43] <gaspyr> yup :)
[11:23:49] <gnarf> also - a lot of us aren't fans of digging into third party plugins - have you tried asking the plugin author?
[11:24:38] <_Z3R0> ihttp://jsfiddle.net/mfwJC/ // so there's no way to do that ?
[11:25:00] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/mfwJC/ // don't know where that i came from
[11:25:50] <shoky> _Z3R0 why no way to do that
[11:26:11] <shoky> _Z3R0 http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/mfwJC/1/
[11:26:23] <shoky> they don't have to be anonymous
[11:26:47] <_Z3R0> yea, just gonna take a little more planning then
[11:27:48] <_Z3R0> I guess I can pass a data-func="f1" or something, since I'm using a single class for all queries and passing data args already
[11:27:58] <_Z3R0> then call the data-func() and pass the other data args
[11:28:16] <_Z3R0> for all links*
[11:28:41] <shoky> data-func sounds like a bad idea ;p
[11:28:56] <_Z3R0> one sec, let me show you what I have currently
[11:31:32] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/mfwJC/7/
[11:31:43] <_Z3R0> can't really test it without the ajax stuff
[11:32:26] <_Z3R0> but I have a lot of links, but they pass different data- since the php they call to, might use different things
[11:32:34] <gaspyr> damn ajax, cant help u much now :D
[11:32:54] <_Z3R0> well you don't really need the ajax part to see what I am trying to do
[11:32:59] <shoky> _Z3R0 what does that have to do with calling one click handler from another
[11:33:06] <_Z3R0> ok example
[11:33:18] <_Z3R0> well let me add to it
[11:33:48] <shoky> you can mock ajax requests on jsfiddle if you really need to. but you dont really need to
[11:34:09] <shoky> if your issue is not ajax related, dont put ajax in the fiddle
[11:34:42] <_Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/mfwJC/8/
[11:35:13] <shoky> no idea what you changed
[11:35:18] <shoky> or what your question is
[11:35:22] <gaspyr> anyway here is ur trick for trigering the click for both links
[11:35:27] <_Z3R0> if (response.url != '') { load_page(response.url, json_params); }
[11:35:31] <gaspyr> http://jsfiddle.net/mfwJC/9/
[11:35:37] <_Z3R0> well, I was basically going to say, like for my "add article" once complete
[11:35:42] <_Z3R0> go to View Articles
[11:35:50] <neumino> Any idea about how I can detect a click on the border of an element (a cell in my case)?
[11:35:52] <_Z3R0> but I'm attempting to do so without making a function for each and every thing
[11:35:58] <gaspyr> but for ajax, i havent read anything about ajax yet
[11:36:26] <_Z3R0> I think that will actually work though
[11:36:27] <gaspyr> zero did u check the fiddle i pasted ? i think thats what u want
[11:36:34] <gaspyr> :D yuppy
[11:36:42] <_Z3R0> yea, you're a little behind gaspry
[11:36:55] <_Z3R0> wtf
[11:36:57] <_Z3R0> how did that work for you ?
[11:37:05] <gaspyr> check the code buddy :D
[11:37:09] <_Z3R0> I tried the same damn thing and it errored onme
[11:37:14] <shoky> triggering clicks, eh :\
[11:37:17] <gaspyr> i just did an old trick and it worked
[11:37:26] <_Z3R0> what old trick ?
[11:37:30] <_Z3R0> I wrote that exact same code
[11:37:37] <_Z3R0> and it got pissed off
[11:37:37] <gaspyr> that trick u c in the fiddle xD
[11:38:02] <_Z3R0> yea $("#link_two").click();  I did that too
[11:38:04] <_Z3R0> and it got pissed off
[11:38:07] <gaspyr> can u paste that in fiddle so i check it out ?
[11:38:24] <donnaR> can I include and use jquery in xul files?
[11:38:33] <shoky> _Z3R0 you obviously did NOT write that same exact code
[11:38:41] <_Z3R0> I swear I did lol
[11:38:56] <shoky> reproduce it, then
[11:38:58] <gaspyr> weird stuff happens sometimes with code :D
[11:39:02] <shoky> not really
[11:39:05] <shoky> :)
[11:39:14] <gaspyr> :D oh :)
[11:39:19] <shoky> weird stuff happens with the human body, for example
[11:39:21] <shoky> not with code ;)
[11:39:48] <gaspyr> within the human <body> ? :D
[11:39:54] <_Z3R0> I dunno but weird... I kept getting post response errors, maybe I removed the e.preventDefault() and didn't realize it, can't find the old save
[11:39:59] <shoky> that's markup, weird stuff galore
[11:40:15] <gaspyr> well ya if u remove preventDefault() wont work
[11:40:20] <_Z3R0> I know that...
[11:40:24] <_Z3R0> don't think I meant to....
[11:40:38] <_Z3R0> just still puzzled lol it was one of the first attempts I tried
[11:40:54] <_Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1968480/jquery-call-click-from-another-click // see even had this page up trying it
[11:40:58] <gaspyr> personally i didnt know that preventDefault(), i actually use an old pure javascript trick which consists into the use of a function returning false on click
[11:41:07] <Whirl3d> I'm considering implementing backbone.js to manage my simple website. Could someone offer some advice about how to get started or should I just smack the ole googles in the arse and see what she spits out?
[11:41:29] <_Z3R0> Whirl3d: I prefer smacking google honestly
[11:41:31] <shoky> gaspyr: that trick in jquery just calls preventDefault and stopPropagation
[11:41:38] <gaspyr> zero, sometimes i spend 2+ hrs fighting and struggling with a code that's actually 99.99% not bugged
[11:41:59] <gaspyr> yea ty shoky and zero will note both those functions :) , awesome
[11:42:00] <_Z3R0> well I think I copied his verbatim
[11:42:00] <shoky> Whirl3d noooo use knockout!
[11:42:05] <_Z3R0> and it didn't have e.preventDefault() on it
[11:42:14] <_Z3R0> and that's probably what caused my error lol
[11:42:17] <Whirl3d> knockout?
[11:42:27] <shoky> yeahhh
[11:42:39] <shoky> just cause i like it. nothing against backbone ;P
[11:42:39] <_Z3R0> gaspyr: trust me... I know
[11:42:50] <gaspyr> :)
[11:43:21] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: are you using backbone.js for a specific reason or just want to learn backbone ?
[11:43:28] <_Z3R0> I remember when I was in like 6th grade writing a site... spent a full day debugging dreamweaver code to figure out why my images weren't showing up from my css, only to find out, the template was stored in a folder below the images, so I had to add ../ in front... 1 day.... 3 characters.... bah
[11:43:55] <Whirl3d> in sixth grade? omg. I am sooo old.
[11:44:03] <_Z3R0> when I was in 6th grade...
[11:44:10] <_Z3R0> that wasn't last year..
[11:44:14] <gaspyr> shoky u use stopPropagation how ?
[11:44:50] <shoky> gaspyr i don't think i've ever used it actually.. but, you use it to stop the event from propagating to more elements in the DOM
[11:45:16] <gaspyr> in which direction up or down the dom tree ?
[11:45:26] <Whirl3d> in sixth grade, I spent about four months writing the assembly code for a simple database that kept track of students grades for teachers...the web souldn't be around for another 6 years, btw
[11:45:28] <shoky> up, mostly :P
[11:45:39] <Exx> Hello everyone !
[11:45:40] <gaspyr> xD
[11:45:47] <Exx> I've got a problem with an ajax request....  I made a $.post() request and filled in it a object with the data and pushed that object into an array. firebug says that the array is filled, but after the post request finished the array is empty this can't be normal :/
[11:46:03] <sacho> Exx, test case
[11:46:05] <_Z3R0> well let's see it ?
[11:46:09] <Exx> http://pastebin.com/nZipVRtf
[11:46:13] <shoky> bring it on
[11:46:21] <shoky> o u just did.
[11:46:33] <Whirl3d> EyePulp, i have found myself in a precarious position where I have tons of great "pages" that I have written in jquery and no common api for bringin them together. It ends up being a real mess.
[11:46:37] <Exx> ^^ yeah I thought that you need to see it :D
[11:46:42] <gaspyr> just a question if u guys dont mind. is everyone here client side oriented ?
[11:46:53] <shoky> Exx there's no array that you're pushing anything into there
[11:47:06] <EyePulp> gaspyr: can you clarify that question
[11:47:07] <shoky> i mean into the data that you're sending to post
[11:47:14] <Exx> ehm oh sry shoky didn't copied everything one moment ^^
[11:47:23] <sacho> that's a lot of goddamn whitespace
[11:47:24] <gaspyr> i think it's already clear :D
[11:47:30] <_Z3R0> lol sacho  no kidding :)
[11:48:01] <noregret> I have a string "/abcd/abc/3" how can I replace the end number (always the one after '/') with a var ? str.replace doesn't take an index..
[11:48:53] <Exx> so here it is complete I hope ^^
[11:48:54] <Exx> http://pastebin.com/hrPktRKj
[11:48:55] <gaspyr> no regret a quik solution  and weird one that popups in my brain is :
[11:49:22] <gaspyr> reverse it, then access the first element with the array symbol [] and change it :D
[11:49:24] <shoky> noregret:  str.slice(0, str.lastIndexOf('/')+1) + var;
[11:49:28] <sacho> noregret, is it a number or a digit?
[11:49:38] <sacho> or what shoky did.
[11:49:40] <natdivad> i'm learning to develop for ios using jquery and phonegap. was reading something about overflow. i'm not sure what the overflow problem is. but it looks to me it's a header and footer bar problem? if in jqm all i need to do is use "fixed" header and footer and problem solved?
[11:49:42] <noregret> sacho: number, could be several digits
[11:49:46] <_Z3R0> I'm confused
[11:49:48] <noregret> shoky: thanks
[11:49:55] <_Z3R0> you have if everything != null, create a new blank objet ?
[11:50:06] <gaspyr> ty shoky, was looking for a way with lastIndeox too :D
[11:50:24] <shoky> ;p
[11:50:42] <gaspyr> can u try middleFirstLastIndexOf () ?
[11:50:44] <sacho> Exx, no arrays being manipulated in thta code
[11:51:21] <Exx> sacho what do you mean? type is gonna be filled with the doctypes Objects
[11:51:51] <_Z3R0>  type[doctypes.type] = doctypes;
[11:51:54] <_Z3R0> he's right
[11:52:02] <sacho> Ah, ok.
[11:52:03] <_Z3R0> but you're overwriting it aren't you ?
[11:52:09] <sacho> That's probably a misuse of arrays.
[11:52:10] <_Z3R0> if the last doctype = ''
[11:52:39] <_Z3R0> no nvm
[11:52:56] <shoky> Exx: what sacho said. do var type = new Object()  not new Array()
[11:53:31] <_Z3R0> arrays can't hold objects in js ?
[11:53:33] <shoky> you want a map/hash, not an ordered array
[11:53:38] <shoky> _Z3R0 sure they can
[11:53:53] <Exx> shoky but why don't they do it in my code?
[11:53:59] <shoky> but you can't do someArray['lol'] = smth;
[11:54:05] <shoky> and expect it to be part of the array
[11:54:05] <sacho> Exx, jquery's $.each() iterates only over numeric indexes in an array(like you would expect it to)
[11:54:14] <sacho> Exx, don't treat the array as hash map.
[11:54:20] <Exx> Oh okay
[11:54:21] <_Z3R0> interesting
[11:54:27] <_Z3R0> so it doesn't do key, value ?
[11:54:42] <sacho> _Z3R0, it iterates arrays and objects differently.
[11:54:44] <shoky> it does index, value
[11:54:45] <gaspyr> actually it's a kind of an associative dictionnary
[11:55:09] <Exx> yeah thats what I wanted gaspyr
[11:55:14] <gaspyr> arrays in js are special cuz of that
[11:55:17] <_Z3R0> so why not use typeID instead of type ?
[11:55:28] <sacho> "it"?
[11:55:36] <_Z3R0> doctypes.typeid = value;
[11:55:37] <_Z3R0> should be an integer I'm assuming
[11:55:48] <Exx> thats right _Z3R0
[11:55:54] <Exx> that could work?
[11:55:59] <gaspyr> just a noob question, how do u guys write those words with dashed broders ?
[11:56:02] <_Z3R0> depends if it has to be ordered or not
[11:56:13] <_Z3R0> but either way you're filling it regardless
[11:56:36] <_Z3R0> just don't know what would happen if it ends up being 1,5,12
[11:56:39] <_Z3R0> instead of 0,1,2
[11:57:13] <shoky> the rest will be undefined
[11:57:14] <Exx> _Z3R0 no there is no need for order...just need to know the information ^^ But why does js create (as far as I understood) new Arrays if you type someArray['asd'] instead of adding it into the existing someArray?
[11:57:38] <sacho> Exx, you're misusing terminology.
[11:57:41] <shoky> Exx it doesn't create a new array
[11:57:59] <_Z3R0> yea, it doesn't create a NEW array, it just can't itterate over 'keys'
[11:57:59] <shoky> it sets the 'asd' property of the someArray object ;p
[11:58:05] <Exx> o.o
[11:58:17] <Exx> who had this idea xD
[11:58:18] <Exx> ?
[11:58:31] <sacho> It's intrinsic to how javascript works.
[11:58:50] <sacho> The stupider part is having the idea that array data should be numerical properties in the array.
[11:58:53] <_Z3R0> besides, I think the object method is better anyways
[11:59:00] <sacho> s/stupider/stupid
[11:59:01] <_Z3R0> object of objects ;)
[11:59:14] <Exx> can I use $.each to objects?
[11:59:18] <sacho> yes
[11:59:19] <Exx> *on
[11:59:23] <Exx> oh nice
[11:59:26] <sacho> read the api docs
[11:59:29] <Exx> okay I'll try thanks all
[12:00:48] <davvblack> what javascript validators do people use?
[12:01:24] <davvblack> jshint has some really stupid errors I can't figure out how to disable, like 'Bad for in variable 'i'.' that just aren't helpful;
[12:02:08] <Exx> okay the object thing doesn't work >.<
[12:02:19] <_Z3R0> O.o
[12:02:22] <sacho> davvblack, what's the line where that error occurs
[12:02:37] <davvblack> for(i in find_array)
[12:02:42] <davvblack> it needs me to put
[12:02:44] <_Z3R0> I been usin this one http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:02:47] <davvblack> for(var i in find_array)
[12:02:50] <davvblack> but that's not better, that's worse
[12:03:22] <davvblack> _Z3R0, sorry, I didn't mean form validators, but like… code quality linting or whatever
[12:03:28] <_Z3R0> oh
[12:03:28] <_Z3R0> lol
[12:03:34] <_Z3R0> hehe
[12:03:53] <_Z3R0> I have no idea what linting is, so I'm out ;)
[12:03:59] <sacho> ..why is it worse?
[12:05:06] <shoky> because it's confusing the actual scope of i
[12:05:08] <shoky> imo.
[12:05:27] <sacho> yes, but jshint doesn't give an error if you have a local variable i
[12:05:40] <shoky> no idea
[12:05:42] <sacho> it'll only give an error if you are using an undeclared i
[12:05:50] <sacho> which is a bad idea.
[12:05:57] <shoky> gotcha
[12:05:57] <_Z3R0> var i = null; ?
[12:05:58] <_Z3R0> lolz
[12:06:04] <shoky> var i;
[12:06:06] <shoky> no?
[12:06:15] <sacho> no need to initialize it.
[12:07:01] <_Z3R0_> bah
[12:07:02] <_Z3R0_> that was annoying
[12:07:26] <_Z3R0_> stipid web cat
[12:09:09] <knite> shoky: were you the one who replied to me earlier re: json format for select2?
[12:12:18] <n00lk0w1> anyone know why this doesn't give joe but instead undefined? http://jsbin.com/3/awuwav/2/edit?html,javascript,live
[12:13:16] <n00lk0w1> (click the orange span)
[12:15:25] <sacho> n00lk0w1, not how jquery's data() works
[12:15:28] <jkevinburton> quick question, i'm doing a selection of dom object by class, they are mixed <p> and <div> and <option> tags, how do I tell what kind of object it is when I do the for loop? $(this)... is "option" do this
[12:16:00] <n00lk0w1> sacho: what am i doing wrong?
[12:16:16] <jkevinburton> duh... .is('option')
[12:18:51] <al_2000> is there any tool that can tell you which .js files arent being used on your page?
[12:18:53] <sacho> n00lk0w1, custom data attributes(data-*) are just a part of html5 specifying a set of valid attributes you can use to store data
[12:19:03] <sacho> n00lk0w1, jquery's data() doesn't interact with those
[12:19:14] <sacho> n00lk0w1, if you want to add data() to an element it has to happen through that function
[12:19:25] <n00lk0w1> sacho: oh, i see.
[12:19:33] <n00lk0w1> although the docs seem to suggest otherwise...
[12:19:36] <sacho> n00lk0w1, if you want to read custom data attributes, read them like any other attribute(attr()). There's nothing special about them
[12:19:49] <n00lk0w1> http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[12:20:16] <sacho> huh.
[12:21:03] <sacho> well what do you know, you're right.
[12:21:38] <n00lk0w1> sacho: it was the outdated version of jq
[12:21:43] <n00lk0w1> i think
[12:22:37] <sacho> what does jsbin use?
[12:24:04] <n00lk0w1> jsbin.com/3/awuwav/2/edit?html,javascript,live
[12:26:41] <sacho> I don't think attributes can have underscores
[12:27:14] <someprimetime> question: if I load in an image and then remove it's src… the image is still visible. I have to remove the DOM node to get rid of it completely. is it possible to keep the structure of the original node without having the src attribute in it and having the image NOT show?
[12:27:33] <sacho> well, they seem to work fine for jquery.
[12:27:41] <someprimetime> something like <img></img> stays but the image is removed
[12:28:02] <someprimetime> i'd rather not have to create a new img element and put it in
[12:28:18] <Exx> so after my firefox crashed while loading my script I'm back and got an (in my opinion) interesting info xD Firebug says that my type array (which now has typeid (int) as keys) is filled with 6 objects (the first one is undefined) but the script still doesn't add my array to my list o.o
[12:30:13] <n00lk0w1> sacho: i checked on #whatwg. they can.
[12:30:37] <sacho> ah, I misread the spec.
[12:32:27] <troydm> hey guys, i have a div that has style="width: 800px; height: 400px" and i put divs inside it that have width of 160px now these in all browsers is displayed as grid however in IE8 each small div is placed on seperate line
[12:32:32] <n00lk0w1> http://jsbin.com/3/awuwav/9/edit?html,javascript,live <-- see the comments.  why does one give joe but the other give undefined? sacho...?
[12:32:42] <troydm> i think it's something to do with flow css setting
[12:32:49] <troydm> but i don't have anything specific set
[12:33:14] <troydm> so i thought you might know/had similiar problems of div placement
[12:33:44] <sacho> n00lk0w1, uhh, $(this) is not the element there
[12:34:38] <ravenzz> troydm #css
[12:34:44] <ravenzz> and be sure to read the topic
[12:34:55] <troydm> ravenzz: sorry
[12:35:01] <ravenzz> np
[12:35:11] <keirlav87> if i have an object with key value pairs, is there a way to remove the key, so that the object just contains values?
[12:36:11] <ravenzz> no
[12:36:17] <ravenzz> map it into an array
[12:36:20] <n00lk0w1> sacho: how should i do it instead?
[12:36:55] <sacho> well, why do you need to pass it as data?
[12:37:59] <sacho> n00lk0w1, http://jsbin.com/3/awuwav/10/edit?html,javascript,live
[12:39:04] <ravenzz> n00lk0w1 what is the issue?
[12:39:44] <Cork> keirlav87: not really
[12:40:04] <Cork> keirlav87: you would have to loop over the object and generate the array
[12:40:11] <ravenzz> eheh
[12:40:15] <Cork> jquery can help a bit though
[12:40:27] <Cork> bah
[12:40:28] <ravenzz> he left
[12:40:34] <Cork> ya i saw
[12:41:27] <Cork> i love when ppl ask question but can't bother to stay around for the answer -_-
[12:41:49] <ravenzz> I answered his question more or less
[12:41:55] <ravenzz> [21:36] <ravenzz> no
[12:41:55] <ravenzz> [21:36] <ravenzz> map it into an array
[12:43:55] <Exx_> why is in the type array the first element "undefined" ?? http://pastebin.com/hrPktRKj
[12:45:23] <Exx_> I don't get it only gets filled if all informations are given (as I wanted) but there is still the first element which is undefined...and I don't understand why ..
[12:45:56] <PigDude> Exx_, WHY do you write your code like this???
[12:46:07] <Exx_> shouldn I ?
[12:46:30] <Exx_> why not ? Is something bad with it?
[12:46:53] <PigDude> Exx_, your decision to iterate the object on line 16 makes no sense at all
[12:47:27] <PigDude> Exx_, you use new Array() and new Object() instead of [] and {}
[12:47:32] <someprimetime> Exx_: it's pretty hard to read your code when you newline every bracket
[12:47:44] <PigDude> Exx_, you keep checking the same value with if() instead of using the more natural switch()
[12:47:47] <someprimetime> PigDude: that's not as big of a deal as the code readability
[12:48:15] <Cork> uh.. how can you guys answer anything from that paste bin
[12:48:16] <Exx_> someprimetime I learned to write like this in Java ;)
[12:48:25] <Cork> the data looped isn't part of it
[12:48:26] <someprimetime> yeah i would have guessed c++
[12:48:31] <Exx_> :D
[12:48:35] <Cork> and each can handle objects just fine
[12:49:22] <Exx_> PigDude does it make any differences when I use [] instead of new Array()?
[12:49:24] <rpaddock> When making a jsonp request, is the success function supposed to be called with the contents of the request?
[12:49:45] <Cork> Exx_: it does, but its not the cause of the undefined value
[12:50:03] <Cork> rpaddock: yes
[12:50:37] <rpaddock> The jsonpCallback isn't ever being called. How would I go about debugging it?
[12:50:37] <Exx_> Cork : so where does this undefined element come from ?
[12:51:50] <Cork> Exx_: type[doctype.type] =
[12:51:54] <Cork> just guessing though
[12:52:07] <n00lk0w1> Why doesn't this .hide() on mouseout? jsbin.com/3/awuwav/12/edit?html,javascript,live
[12:52:10] <Cork> if type ex. starts with 1 you would get an empty value
[12:52:24] <Cork> ?eval var a = []; a[1] = 1; a
[12:52:26] <bot-t> Cork: [, 1]
[12:52:28] <PigDude> Exx_, not in particular, I just found your code really firghtening
[12:52:39] <someprimetime> does drag drop not work in ie9?
[12:52:48] <PigDude> Exx_, nad I couldn't see what your actual issue would be just by looking at that code, so maybe you should paste some small code demonstrating?
[12:52:49] <someprimetime> would rather not have to use jquery ui but will if i have to
[12:52:55] <PigDude> Exx_, use jsfiddle.net
[12:52:57] <someprimetime> this is re: html5 btw
[12:53:57] <Exx_> PigDude: I'll make it just a moment :) Cork: but the type[doctype.type]= part is only called if everything is defined so there couldn't be any undefined
[12:54:51] <Cork> Exx_: ya, but your setting the postion in the array
[12:55:07] <n00lk0w1> sacho_: any idea why it isn't hide()ing on mouseout of #s? jsbin.com/3/awuwav/12/edit?html,javascript,live
[12:55:14] <Cork> js will fill the array with undefined values up to the number you use
[12:55:25] <Cork> ?eval var a = []; a[5] = 1; a
[12:55:26] <bot-t> Cork: [, , , , , 1]
[12:55:37] <Cork> Exx_: like that ^
[12:55:47] <Cork> (undefined isn't displayed there though)
[12:55:58] <PigDude> >> isNaN(undefined)
[12:56:05] <rpaddock> Is jsonp even needed if I'm trying to load static content cross-domain? I'm just trying to make sure it's async. would getScript suffice?
[12:56:06] <PigDude> oops
[12:56:09] <Cork> ?eval var a = []; a[5] = 1; a[0] == undefined
[12:56:09] <bot-t> Cork: true
[12:56:13] <PigDude> i thought i was in ##javascript
[12:56:28] <Cork> ya, i really miss its execution bot
[12:56:35] <Cork> it beats this one by far
[12:56:36] <Exx_> first: jsfiddle.net gives me a gateway time out and cork: but I have changed it to typeid and they go from 0 to 5
[12:56:39] <PigDude> Cork, /msg ecmabot >> ...
[12:57:02] <PigDude> Exx_, oof, that hasn't happened in a while
[12:57:03] <Cork> PigDude: that doesn't output in this channel
[12:57:35] <Cork> Exx_: like i said, it was a guess, its impossible to say without seeing the data used
[12:57:52] <Cork> as the data causing the problem isn't in your pb
[12:58:10] <PigDude> Exx_, you can try http://plunker.no.de/edit
[12:58:32] <t4nkd> How do I change the CSS properties for an element's pseudo selected state?
[12:58:37] <Cork> jsbin is quite nice too
[12:58:51] <Cork> t4nkd: those can't be inline
[12:58:56] <Cork> so in a css rule
[12:58:56] <n00lk0w1> ravenzz: any idea?
[12:59:24] <t4nkd> Cork: crappeh, so, make a class for that selector I guess?
[12:59:40] <Cork> t4nkd: yes, like you should always to
[12:59:43] <Cork> to==do
[12:59:44] <t4nkd> .btn:active {something}, .btn.different:active {another}
[12:59:52] <Cork> css should hold the styling
[13:00:03] <t4nkd> Makes sense, thanks!
[13:00:08] <Cork> only the mechanics should be in js
[13:00:33] <ravenzz> n00lk0w1 sorry I miss the question
[13:02:04] <Exx_> lol now jsfiddle gives 502 Bad Gateway :D and Cork the Data is json object which works pretty fine
[13:07:01] <Exx_> so just controlled the typeid began at 1 so now I add it with typeid-1 and its pretty okay...no undefined everything allright...BUT it still doesn't add my elements to my list even if it goes into the $.each loop
[13:07:54] <Exx_> so actual the array is filled with objects the objects are filled with my needed information the script jumps into the fill function loops through the array but doesn't add the elements to the html
[13:08:41] <lancealtar> Exx_: jsfiddle example?
[13:10:34] <Whirl3d> is there a preferred way, when given a search string, to determine if the search string appears in an array of terms without manually iterating through the entire list?
[13:10:38] <Cork> Exx_: that the json works isn't something i doubt, but its values is most likely what causes the effect
[13:11:01] <Cork> ?.inArray @ Whirl3d
[13:11:01] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:11:12] <Cork> that is iteration though
[13:11:38] <Whirl3d> Suppose that would be faster than concatenating the array and using regex match?
[13:11:46] <Cork> yes
[13:11:52] <Cork> and its safer too
[13:11:54] <lancealtar> much faster
[13:12:07] <Cork> converting an array to string and searching that is risky
[13:12:16] <Whirl3d> Wow. I had no idea. that's good news.
[13:12:31] <Whirl3d> about the speed thing. The risky thing, sure but I thought it was fastest
[13:12:42] <Whirl3d> thanks
[13:12:46] <Cork> Whirl3d: safer as in string search tend to give false positives
[13:13:03] <Cork> Whirl3d: iteration is really fast in js
[13:13:10] <danzik17> even if it was the fastest, that's quite a micro-optimization.....write what makes sense, optimize the hot path later.
[13:13:58] <Whirl3d> danzik17, can I hire you to just sit on my shoulder and say that every time I pause to do something "better" or "faster"? LOL
[13:14:11] <Whirl3d> I sure waste a LOT of time optimizing.
[13:14:21] <PigDude> Whirl3d, you aren't even optimizing. THINK about what you are doing
[13:14:44] <Whirl3d> PigDude, that's the problem, now isn't it.
[13:15:26] <PigDude> Whirl3d, what is more expensive: iterate the array and break on match? or, traverse the entire array to create a string that uses as much memory, then execute an NFA regex over that string so that each position is checked
[13:16:02] <PigDude> Whirl3d, even if you join your array on some trustworthy delimiter for that regex search, array traversal is faster than regular expression traversing to character
[13:16:14] <Whirl3d> tell ya what PigDude, which is better to file your motions in one batch with the Judge or to file them incrementally?
[13:16:30] <PigDude> I do not know what you mean by "Judge"
[13:16:42] <Whirl3d> Oh, wait, you're not an attorney and don't know about filing motions, perhaps that's why you dind't know
[13:16:52] <Whirl3d> I'm not a developer, I am just learning
[13:17:04] <Whirl3d> That's why I didn't know
[13:17:09] <PigDude> Whirl3d, is a symptom of being a lawyer that you have to tell everyone you're a lawyer?
[13:17:20] <Whirl3d> I'm not an attorney either
[13:17:22] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:17:22] <PigDude> oh ok
[13:17:45] <Whirl3d> I do work with one attorney, but he is the greatest...one of the best in the country, imo...
[13:18:29] <Whirl3d> but for the most part, attorneys suck. I was just trying to demonstrate that had I known what I know now, it wouldn't have been a question to ask.
[13:18:43] <PigDude> well thee is a notation for the growth of an algorithm relative to its size. an agorithm that doesn't grow with input size is referred to O(1). if growth is 1:1 with size, it is O(n). index(arr, o) is O(n). your idea is O(2 * n) or worse
[13:18:47] <PigDude> *there
[13:19:37] <PigDude> Whirl3d, that's a high-level way of judging the fitness of an algorithm. then you have to consider performance under normal conditions, as big-O notation applies to "worst-case"
[13:20:20] <Whirl3d> see, just for insight into what I was thinking, in order to iterate through an array, you have to set up registers and then execute multiple lines of code to get what regex does "magically"...perhaps through some sort of binary manipulation---making it faster...
[13:20:21] <PigDude> Whirl3d, however, for input sizes small or large, index(a, o) beats a.join(delim).match(makeMyRegex(substr))
[13:20:32] <Whirl3d> Next your gonna tell me there is no such thing as magic, I know
[13:21:33] <PigDude> Whirl3d, note that for the basic case (static string match) s.indexOf(subs) is better than using a regular expression. it is faster
[13:22:07] <Whirl3d> That makes total sense, but until you just said that I would have thought it was the other way around.
[13:22:29] <danzik17> either way, you're optimizing what shouldn't be optimized.  which is clearer ( psuedo code ):  if ( this array contains "foo" )          OR   ( if array.join() contains substring "foo" )
[13:22:44] <danzik17> write your code clearly first
[13:23:37] <Whirl3d> oh, see in my head, the pseudo code goes: which is clearer, go through each of these items in the array to check if there's a match or do it once with a long string and a regex
[13:24:06] <Whirl3d> in my head, there's no need to handle escaping out the loop if you get a positive result
[13:24:45] <Whirl3d> in my head one, clean line of code makes more pseudo sense BUt I am learning..
[13:25:25] <PigDude> Whirl3d, any decent index(a, o) function will figure that out for you
[13:25:30] <PigDude> Whirl3d, will break on success
[13:25:58] <lancealtar> Whirl3d: and with what PigDude said, it is native code, which is much, much faster.
[13:26:38] <PigDude> to be fair, indexOf and match/test are native code as well
[13:26:51] <danzik17> even if you did want "clean" code, myArray.indexOf( "foo" ) !== -1 or $.inArray( myArray, "foo" ) reads far better than /foo/.test( myarray.join("" )
[13:27:12] <PigDude> note that [].indexOf is not present in older IE
[13:27:21] <Whirl3d> You guys have any suggestions for references on how to setup a fulll site from scratch? Specifically managing content divided into "sections" and "pages" etc...
[13:27:31] <lancealtar> PigDude: fair enough.
[13:29:43] <Es0teric> i have a question... i am using getJSON to retrieve album covers from lastfm api.. some album covers dont load, but when the song is done, it loads the album cover.. my question is -- would it be appropriate to send another request if the first request brings back no covers and no album name?
[13:31:16] <Whirl3d> I have a function that accepts a url to load an image on a page and I want to be sure that I haven't already got that image sitting in my collection of images...I had planed to map the src attributes of the images to an array and check the array for the url....but maybe there's a better way?
[13:31:18] <lancealtar> Es0teric: I would limit how many times it checks, but other than that, yes.
[13:34:09] <Es0teric> lancealtar i see
[13:34:20] <Es0teric> well i would make it check one more time
[13:34:28] <Es0teric> then if it doesnt find anything, to assign a default cover
[13:34:50] <lancealtar> I would define that as appropriate.
[13:36:14] <Es0teric> lancealtar its wierd though.. some album covers load instantly and others dont load, so it assigns the blank default cover
[13:36:32] <Es0teric> i would have to set a delay for the information being retrieved
[13:36:38] <lancealtar> Do you have a jsfiddle example, Es0teric?
[13:36:55] <Es0teric> lancealtar i can make one
[13:37:02] <Es0teric> but jsfiddle is loading really slowly today
[13:48:43] <miceiken> does anyone here have any experience with fancybox?
[13:49:12] <lancealtar> Yes
[13:49:34] <miceiken> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11004355/fancybox-v2-stuck-loads-wrong-size-but-when-i-exist-and-click-the-fancy-box-ag
[13:49:38] <miceiken> i just found this actually
[13:49:44] <miceiken> seems to fit my problem
[13:49:50] <lancealtar> Excellent
[13:53:30] <noregret> i got a $(tr).click() event, is there a way to exclude this event from a certain element in the <tr> e.g. such as a checkbox
[13:53:36] <miceiken> lancealtar, mind if i pm you a link to a pic? just realized it contains my real name so I dont wanna share it
[13:53:52] <lancealtar> miceiken: that's fine
[13:53:58] <Whirl3d> you could also preload your images before having fancybox try it. Then you could get the dimensions ahead of time.
[13:54:27] <miceiken> well it's not an image, it's actually more of a page
[13:54:50] <lancealtar> it's an SWF
[13:55:09] <miceiken> in regards to Whirl3d, response
[13:55:09] <Whirl3d> 'nuff said.
[13:55:33] <miceiken> it's not a swf. I made a recording using Jing that shows the problem
[13:55:35] <miceiken> http://me.miceiken.net/2012-06-27_2252.swf
[13:56:25] <lancealtar> Is this a dev page on your localhost?
[13:56:30] <miceiken> yeah
[13:56:42] <miceiken> unfortunately =/
[13:56:46] <lancealtar> k
[13:56:50] <Whirl3d> I heard the claim that Flash CS6 is supposed to compile to html5 canvas but I haven't tried it...don't know if they are telling the entire story...
[13:56:53] <lancealtar> one minute
[13:56:54] <miceiken> but you see the issue, right?
[13:57:07] <miceiken> I tried setting width to 720px
[13:58:05] <kenny2> Hi guys Im trying to do a basic jquery ajax request to get a string of data from my database, but my data is keeping coming as null. Here are my paste bins, http://pastebin.com/4kEScJfn <---html part http://pastebin.com/ubEVpES0 <---php part
[13:58:15] <kenny2> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[13:58:44] <lancealtar> miceiken: I believe so. The fancybox is being use for a form, right?
[13:59:05] <miceiken> it's an image with a comment function
[13:59:13] <miceiken> so not really, what I have is more a complete page
[13:59:19] <miceiken> maybe I should use iframe instead
[13:59:31] <noregret> what's the best event for a cehckbox ?
[13:59:34] <noregret> is it click ?
[13:59:51] <Dr-Bombay> its birthday
[14:00:00] <rmill> :|
[14:00:00] <miceiken> lol
[14:00:20] <lancealtar> i love birthday events
[14:00:32] <noregret> let's stay with query events
[14:00:35] <noregret> jquery
[14:01:00] <lancealtar> miceiken: Have you tried it with an iframe?
[14:01:00] <rmill> ?change @ noregret
[14:01:01] <bot-t> noregret, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[14:01:28] <miceiken> yeah lancealtar, and it works, problem is I have nav keys IN the iframe, that means it doesnt have access to the parent frame
[14:01:42] <miceiken> so I can't navigate to the next picture in the gallery
[14:01:48] <noregret> rmill: wouldn't be toggle better in this case ? for handling checking/unchecking ie..
[14:02:05] <Whirl3d> Kenny2, $.getJSON is a shortcut for $.ajax. Maybe you could try $.ajax (url, {dataType:"json", success:function (data) {do stuff}});
[14:02:07] <rmill> ?tias
[14:02:07] <bot-t> Try It And See
[14:02:49] <kenny2> I will try that whirl3d
[14:03:06] <kenny2> but I think I have alrady done that lol
[14:03:22] <Whirl3d> and maybe change the dataType to html and see if you get anything in Data.
[14:03:32] <kenny2> ok
[14:06:25] <kenny2> whirl3d
[14:06:31] <kenny2> i tried what you said
[14:06:37] <kenny2> but it still comes as null
[14:06:41] <kenny2> for both datatype json and html
[14:07:11] <Whirl3d> then it must be something on the server side. can you run the url in our browser window?
[14:07:34] <kenny2> I'll try that right now
[14:07:42] <Whirl3d> try your php call directly and say "view source" to see if anything spits out
[14:07:54] <kenny2> oh
[14:08:02] <kenny2> in the php file
[14:08:05] <kenny2> nothing is being spit out
[14:08:15] <Whirl3d> I think we found your problem.
[14:08:30] <Whirl3d> but that is outside the scope of my limited ability to help.
[14:08:37] <kenny2> do I have to import something for json_encode?
[14:08:54] <kenny2> do you think I should try it on other servers
[14:08:57] <kenny2> and see what happens?
[14:09:21] <Whirl3d> the php script?
[14:09:37] <Es0teric> question, whats better? tipsy or the tooltip from bootstrap?
[14:09:57] <noregret> i got a $(tr).click() event, is there a way to exclude this event from a certain element in the <tr> e.g. such as a checkbox? i'm using change event for hte cehckbox, but when clicking the checkbox, both events are running
[14:10:03] <kenny2> ya
[14:10:06] <kenny2> both
[14:11:53] <kenny2> hmm
[14:11:55] <kenny2> i think I may have fixed it
[14:11:56] <Es0teric> this thing
[14:11:58] <Es0teric> is rediculous
[14:11:58] <kenny2> let me veryify
[14:12:02] <kenny2> and I will let you know whirl3d
[14:12:08] <Es0teric> its not even allowing me to use the tooltip on multiple classes
[14:12:14] <silverwind> noregret, I guess you could add a click event on the checkbox and do e.stopPropagation() in it
[14:12:27] <Whirl3d> 8)
[14:12:41] <NoiseEee> noregret: inquire about what element the event happened on, if its a checkbox, return/ignore
[14:13:10] <kenny2> now
[14:13:14] <kenny2> instead of null
[14:13:15] <istvan> hello all - I am using jscrollpane for custom scrollbars. Inside the scrolled-div there are several child divs. How can I get the ID of the topmost visible div?
[14:13:16] <kenny2> im getting undefined
[14:13:19] <kenny2> LOL
[14:14:16] <istvan> ie. which of #addNodeBodyScroll's children is at the top of the stack and is visible: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/769536/cluster/layout.html
[14:14:37] <noregret> silverwind: thanks, that works
[14:14:59] <Allandrick> evening all - is it OK to ask newbie (relatively) questions here? :)
[14:15:03] <silverwind> You're welcome :)
[14:15:17] <silverwind> Allandrick, if it's not a stupid question, sure :)
[14:15:23] <Allandrick> :)
[14:16:40] <Allandrick> I'm building a form in a perl WebApp which has dynamic data that I want to know which fields have changed when the form is submitted back to the WebApp - so I've setup a jQuery script to detect changes to fields and I was hoping to set another hidden field's value to true when that happens
[14:17:21] <Allandrick> now here's the trick - I've named the hidden fields the same as the other fields with a ":modified" tag at the end of the name="" in the form
[14:17:42] <Allandrick> and I'm trying to reference that field in the script - not sure it's working though :(
[14:18:18] <silverwind> Why do you have to use a : ?
[14:18:31] <silverwind> You're making it difficult for yourself for no reason.
[14:18:48] <Allandrick> can be anything really
[14:18:59] <Allandrick> so the field that is editable is called fred
[14:19:06] <Allandrick> the hidden field is named fred-modified
[14:19:09] <Allandrick> or fred:modified
[14:19:14] <Allandrick> either or - same to me :)
[14:19:33] <silverwind> Do you need to change the name? Could you add another attribute on the element instead?
[14:19:58] <Allandrick> would that attribute be passed to the WebApp?
[14:20:08] <Allandrick> after submit?
[14:20:15] <silverwind> Ah.. it must be passed to the controller?
[14:20:17] <Allandrick> aye
[14:20:36] <Allandrick> so I'm building a list of values and I only want to change the source data if it has actually changed on the form
[14:20:57] <Allandrick> and the submit context of the script doesn't have a copy of the original form data
[14:21:06] <Allandrick> hence wanting to pass change status thru
[14:21:19] <Allandrick> bad design overall but it's a quick'n'dirty tool :)
[14:21:24] <silverwind> That's weird :(
[14:21:27] <silverwind> Yeah
[14:21:45] <Allandrick> so I'm trying to dereference the :modified field as:                \$('#'+\$(this).attr('name')+":modified").val("true");
[14:22:18] <silverwind> I'm not sure jQuery likes the :
[14:22:27] <Allandrick> oic
[14:22:31] <silverwind> Because it's used within the selector engine
[14:22:35] <Allandrick> ah
[14:22:43] <Allandrick> let me try something else
[14:22:49] <silverwind> Try a - instead
[14:23:20] <Allandrick> (even though it's a name value?)
[14:23:31] <Whirl3d> why not use the .data object for your fields, and on change, set the data-chached attribute to true. Then you can setup a custom selector so that you just do $(":modified") and it will grab the ones with data-modified=true;
[14:23:45] <silverwind> Allandrick, Why do you check for a ID then?
[14:24:14] <silverwind> Whirl3d, seems that he wants to pass on the "modified" flag to the server.. :(
[14:24:14] <Allandrick> woah my head just exploded sorry I'm very fresh at this :)
[14:24:19] <Allandrick> ah yes.
[14:25:03] <Whirl3d> don't you just need to map an array of attributes in a single field that you send to the server?
[14:25:41] <Whirl3d> something like: modifiedAttributes: ["name","date"]
[14:26:42] <Allandrick> so I'm detecting changes based on the example at http://www.mydogboris.com/2009/10/using-jquery-data-feature-to-detect-form-changes/
[14:27:28] <Allandrick> each time there's a change to the editable fields, the function is triggered - that much is working
[14:27:39] <miceiken> lancealtar, so let's not care about this for a while, any expierence with fancybox and scrollbars?
[14:27:44] <Allandrick> and I can compare the current vs. initial value
[14:27:58] <miceiken> the vertical scrollbar causes the content to shift, also creating a horizontal scrollbar
[14:28:32] <lancealtar> miceiken: yes, you have to provide padding in your CSS.
[14:28:33] <Allandrick> so I was hoping to set an existing hidden field (that exists for each editable field) to true - but the name of the existing field is based on the name of the editable one.
[14:28:38] <Allandrick> just to explain it a bit better?
[14:28:42] <miceiken> padding where?
[14:28:56] <Allandrick> then I know I can parse it properly on the server side
[14:29:00] <lancealtar> miceiken: on the right side for the scroll bars
[14:30:18] <Whirl3d> but Allandrick, why not just pass the changed fields back to the server...no extra fields or anything
[14:31:12] <miceiken> lancealtar, but I want the fancybox popout to automaticly adjust the width so that it wont create a horizontal scrollbar
[14:31:24] <Allandrick> not entirely sure how I do that - do you mean on a per-field basis or when the submit button is pressed?
[14:31:50] <Allandrick> oh I see
[14:32:12] <Whirl3d> presumably, you already have the data on the server, right?
[14:32:23] <Allandrick> create a bit of script that handles the submit, goes looking for fields with a changed attribute set to true, and only submit the data that has changed?
[14:32:36] <Allandrick> well sort of - the perl WebApp fetches that data from another API
[14:32:44] <Whirl3d> so you just need the changes. You could easily apply a class to the input element and select by that class
[14:33:00] <lancealtar> miceiken: According to http://fancybox.net/api you have to provide dimensions otherwise it won't give you expected results.
[14:33:14] <lancealtar> miceiken: Take a look at http://fancybox.net/api under "audoDimensions"
[14:33:33] <Allandrick> Whirl3d: you mean using a beforeSubmit option?
[14:33:34] <miceiken> that's the old fancybox
[14:33:42] <miceiken> http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/
[14:34:10] <Allandrick> thank you for chatting by the way - I know it's a pain when old hacks try new tricks ;-)
[14:34:18] <lancealtar> miceiken: take a look at http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs under autoSize
[14:34:26] <miceiken> I have that enabled
[14:34:39] <miceiken> but it's supposed to be 720px at all times
[14:34:43] <miceiken> but for some reason it isnt
[14:34:44] <lancealtar> miceiken: are dimensions set?
[14:35:01] <lancealtar> miceiken: "If no dimensions set this may give unexpected results"
[14:35:30] <miceiken> yeah
[14:37:07] <lancealtar> miceiken: Do you have scrolling set to 'no'?
[14:37:46] <Allandrick> oh crap or I could just use this: http://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/app/crud.php
[14:37:59] <Allandrick> ^%"
[14:38:08] <Allandrick> fan bloody tastic :)
[14:38:12] <lancealtar> Also, if you want to use an iframe and have controls inside the iframe, you can easily accomplish this by doing "parent.$.fancybox.close();" or whatever method you want to trigger.
[14:38:28] <miceiken> lancealtar, no because I still want horizontal scroll
[14:41:18] <oojacoboo> is there any way to take a string and treat it like jquery objects?
[14:41:41] <chrickso> hi, would someone look at this for me? http://jsfiddle.net/NHDYG/
[14:41:41] <oojacoboo> so that I can find an array of objects and loop over them, etc
[14:42:03] <cohitre_> oojacoboo: query has utility methods for dealing with arrays
[14:42:13] <cohitre_> ? $.each @ oojacoboo
[14:42:15] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:42:23] <oojacoboo> cohitre_, I'm more concerned with the string
[14:42:29] <oojacoboo> not how to loop over an array, I know how to do that
[14:42:39] <chrickso> i'm trying to say, if the 2nd input box has been edited, stop replacing its contents with the first input box. not sure how to access that urlEdited var from inside the functions...
[14:42:41] <cohitre_> what do you want to do with the string?
[14:42:58] <oojacoboo> var str = "<blah>html</blah>";
[14:43:07] <oojacoboo> how can I treat that like DOM elements
[14:43:17] <silverwind> $(str) ?
[14:43:21] <cohitre_> oh. $(str) will do that.
[14:43:29] <oojacoboo> ok cool, thanks :)
[14:58:58] <miceiken> argh i hate lightbox
[15:02:46] <oojacoboo> miceiken, that's why I made my own custom one called phatbox :)
[15:03:06] <miceiken> is it public?
[15:03:17] <oojacoboo> na it's baked into our app
[15:03:25] <oojacoboo> I prob should make it public though
[15:04:10] <oojacoboo> http://files.jacobt.com/phatbox.png
[15:04:18] <noregret> i have several checkboxes, is there a way to select them all and get all their ids e.g ? maybe serialize the ids or something, any ideas ?
[15:04:25] <oojacoboo> you can drag it around and everything :)
[15:04:31] <noregret> several checked checkboxes *
[15:04:47] <oojacoboo> noregret, serialize() will work
[15:04:55] <oojacoboo> use a selector that will select them all…
[15:05:20] <noregret> oojacoboo: e.g $(:checked).serialize() ?
[15:05:21] <oojacoboo> $('input[type="checkbox"]');
[15:05:33] <oojacoboo> oh, the checked ones yea
[15:05:37] <oojacoboo> I'd do that server side though
[15:06:16] <oojacoboo> noregret, POST will only send the ones checked
[15:06:22] <oojacoboo> you don't have to check for that for POST
[15:07:17] <noregret> oojacoboo: even an ajax post ?
[15:07:25] <noregret> coz i'm trying to send them all thru ajax
[15:07:27] <oojacoboo> it doesn't discriminate
[15:08:15] <noregret> i usually use $.getjson, i'll use $.post this time
[15:08:35] <oojacoboo> noregret, or $.ajax() :)
[15:08:43] <oojacoboo> method post
[15:10:17] <oojacoboo> anyone know if I can do something like… $(foo).find(this) ?
[15:10:37] <oojacoboo> I'm looping over and need to locate this within the object
[15:10:38] <shoky> something like what?
[15:10:45] <mwillhite> just learned that I can't call .submit() on a form with a file input in IE otherwise I get "Access Denied"
[15:10:46] <noregret> oojacoboo: i think i should serialize them anyway to pass teh data to post
[15:10:49] <mwillhite> anyone know of a workaround?
[15:10:53] <noregret> oojacoboo: as i don't have the checkboxes in a form
[15:10:55] <mwillhite> I'm trying to do ajax file uploads
[15:10:56] <shoky> what do you mean, locate this within the object?
[15:11:00] <oojacoboo> noregret, yes, serialize
[15:11:02] <someprimetime> anyone know if this is possible (posted on SO) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11235488/set-javascript-object-value-at-time-of-creation
[15:11:53] <cohitre> oojacoboo: can you explain the big picture of what are you trying to do?
[15:12:10] <oojacoboo> shoky, I have a set of objects I'm looping over that are pulled from a string.  I then want to append html to some of these objects within the set I've "selected" and looping over.
[15:12:39] <oojacoboo> when looping, the object I have is just that object obv, I want to find and append within the original string/object
[15:13:09] <gaspyr> hello folks of the best irc room
[15:13:21] <cohitre> oojacoboo: build a full DOM, manipulate it and then use .html to get a new string
[15:13:41] <ryanneuf_> Anyone in SF for the conf tomorrow?
[15:13:44] <shoky> oojacoboo: a set of objects pulled from a string?
[15:13:55] <miceiken> lancealtar, even though I set with and height in the js object it doesnt care
[15:14:04] <miceiken> still makes the popout huge as i can
[15:14:05] <oojacoboo> var str = "<obj>html</obj>";
[15:14:05] <someprimetime> ryanneuf_: i'm in SF but i missed out on tix
[15:14:16] <someprimetime> if you know anyone with an extra one i'll be willing to pay for it :)
[15:14:23] <shoky> oojacoboo: ok you have a jq collection of elements.
[15:14:31] <oojacoboo> shoky, yes
[15:14:34] <ryanneuf_> I only have the one, don't know anyone in SF
[15:14:57] <shoky> oojacoboo: and what is 'this' ?
[15:15:03] <oojacoboo> and I want to look over a subset of that and append html to them as needed
[15:15:11] <oojacoboo> shoky, it's a list item to be specific
[15:15:12] <shoky> k
[15:15:30] <shoky> what's the question, then?
[15:15:31] <noregret> is there a way to serialize the IDs of a list of checked checkboxes ? i'm trying to post them thru ajax
[15:15:56] <ryanneuf_> noregret: $('form').serialze()
[15:16:07] <noregret> ryanneuf_: i don't have the checkboxes in a form
[15:16:10] <cohitre> noregret: why do you want to serialize the ids and not the name attributes?
[15:16:11] <oojacoboo> well, I'm not sure how to append the html to the elements I'm looping over within the subset of the original string, and return back the original string with the modified objects
[15:16:28] <noregret> cohitre: i'm interested in the IDs only
[15:16:39] <ryanneufeld_> noregret: why not?
[15:16:43] <vacho> guys..
[15:16:50] <vacho> I have a problem getting to an object...check this out:
[15:16:56] <vacho> $($(this).parent().parent()).find('span').text(value);
[15:16:58] <cohitre> noregret: why are you interested in the ids only?
[15:17:02] <hye> why is this selector not working?  '.checkE :checkbox:checked[XFactor="True"]'
[15:17:08] <shoky> oojacoboo: the string is irrelevant once you make a jq object from it
[15:17:11] <vacho> problem is I have two spans there... they have different classes..how can I select the span with a specific class?
[15:17:14] <hye> hi vacho
[15:17:23] <mwillhite> vacho: span.clazz
[15:17:24] <ryanneufeld_> ?selectors @ hye
[15:17:24] <bot-t> hye, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[15:17:25] <shoky> oojacoboo: what subset are you talking about..
[15:17:28] <vacho> hye: Hi
[15:17:31] <oojacoboo> shoky, well, I don't know how to modify a subset and replace that within the original object
[15:17:39] <hye> vacho hye es?
[15:17:47] <shoky> oojacoboo:  what subset?
[15:17:49] <sunbeam> alert(jQuery('preview-images-thumbs-small li').first().('a').attr('src'));
[15:17:53] <sunbeam> anyone knows whats wrong with this?
[15:17:55] <oojacoboo> shoky, I have a lot of html, then I select the subset I want to loop over, modify, then return back to the original object
[15:18:02] <shoky> oojacoboo: you modify it just like you modify any other jq obj
[15:18:02] <noregret> cohitre: those ids contain record ids in the db, that's why it's the only thing i need to manipulate that record
[15:18:03] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: it's using an alert
[15:18:09] <mwillhite> sunbeam: .('a')
[15:18:09] <sunbeam> jQuery('preview-images-thumbs-small li').first().('a').attr('src');
[15:18:11] <sunbeam> without then
[15:18:12] <cohitre> oojacoboo: build a full DOM, manipulate it and then use .html to get a new string
[15:18:17] <mwillhite> its not a functino
[15:18:22] <oojacoboo> cohitre, build a full DOM means what?
[15:18:25] <shoky> oojacoboo: 'return back to the original object'.. ??
[15:18:26] <sunbeam> mwillhite: ok what should i use then
[15:18:33] <mwillhite> I think .first('a') would work
[15:18:37] <sunbeam> ok
[15:18:37] <shoky> you only have one object, no
[15:18:38] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: also, there is no html element 'preview-images-thumbs-small'
[15:18:39] <mwillhite> assuming thats what you intended
[15:18:46] <mwillhite> yes
[15:18:47] <cohitre> noregret: don't use the ids for this, set the value of the checkboxes
[15:18:50] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: you need a . or # at the beginning
[15:18:51] <mwillhite> thats either a class or an id
[15:19:03] <cohitre> and then use .serialize()
[15:19:07] <oojacoboo> shoky, I want to append html to a subset of elements within a jq collection of elements
[15:19:10] <vacho> mwillhite: thanks that worked!
[15:19:17] <sunbeam> i get undefined
[15:19:18] <shoky> oojacoboo: and what's the problem?
[15:19:32] <sunbeam> ah ofc ryanneufeld_ sorry
[15:19:33] <mwillhite> sunbeam: refer to ryanneufeld_ 's comment
[15:19:34] <oojacoboo> shoky, obv I can't figure out how to get it working
[15:19:48] <shoky> oojacoboo: myJqObj.find('whatever').append('whatever2')
[15:19:52] <shoky> for example..
[15:20:06] <oojacoboo> shoky, I need to loop over them b/c I need to count them
[15:20:08] <cohitre> oojacoboo: when you use $(yourString) you are creating a new object, it will not update yourString automatically
[15:20:10] <sunbeam> hmm
[15:20:11] <sunbeam> alert(jQuery('.preview-images-thumbs-small li').first('a').attr('src'));
[15:20:14] <sunbeam> still undefined
[15:20:24] <hye> ryanneufeld that wasn't very nice
[15:20:25] <shoky> oojacoboo: you dont need to loop over them to count them
[15:20:33] <cohitre> oojacoboo: so what you want to do is update the new object and then call .html() after you have done whatever transformations you need
[15:20:33] <shoky> oojacoboo:  X.find('whatever').length
[15:20:46] <ryanneufeld_> hye: ?
[15:20:51] <oojacoboo> cohitre, I see what you mean
[15:21:10] <ryanneufeld_> ?demo @ sunbeam
[15:21:11] <bot-t> sunbeam, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:21:13] <oojacoboo> I still don't see how I can append to all but the last one within having a while loop
[15:21:23] <oojacoboo> without*
[15:21:26] <Whirl3d> subeam, you want the src attribute of your first anchor?
[15:21:30] <shoky> that's the first you say about 'all but the last one', whatever that means
[15:21:50] <oojacoboo> a set of list items, I want to append html to all but the last one in the set
[15:22:02] <oojacoboo> which is part of a larger object
[15:22:04] <cohitre> ? pastie @ oojacoboo
[15:22:04] <bot-t> oojacoboo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:22:12] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: also see ?first()
[15:22:13] <bot-t> sunbeam, .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[15:22:27] <shoky> oojacoboo: myjqObj.find('whatever').slice(-1).append('somehtml')
[15:22:34] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: first() doesn't take any arguments
[15:22:37] <oojacoboo> shoky, interesting
[15:22:54] <shoky> oops
[15:23:06] <shoky> i meant slice(0,-1) i think
[15:23:09] <sunbeam> ryanneufeld_: http://jsfiddle.net/LGShu/1/
[15:23:14] <oojacoboo> I'll check out slice() thanks
[15:23:43] <sunbeam> ryanneufeld_: http://jsfiddle.net/LGShu/2/
[15:23:44] <shoky> oojacoboo: and if you wanted/needed to loop over them that wouldn't be a problem either..  with .each
[15:23:54] <oojacoboo> yea, that's what I was trying
[15:24:15] <shoky> myjqObj.find('whatever').each(function(i,el) { ... } )
[15:25:00] <oojacoboo> yea, but how would you modify the elements and them "add" them back to the original object
[15:25:08] <_Z3R0_> anyone know much about the jquery-ui drag and drop, problem is, the last item dragged from a column / container, hides the container and then nothing can be moved back to the container
[15:25:12] <donnaR> hey jq I'm running multiple post requests that is important to reply back to specific elements, now I'm using $('test').each(.... $(this), but doesn't work because by the time callback request is activated $(this) has changed, what do?
[15:25:39] <shoky> oojacoboo: you just modify them and they are modified. i still dont know what 'original object' you are talking about
[15:25:40] <_Z3R0_> var myDiv = $(this); // references as myDiv ?
[15:25:55] <cohitre> oojacoboo: can you explain the big picture of what you are trying to do? what do you start with, what do you end with?
[15:26:01] <oojacoboo> shoky, $(this).append() within that loop?
[15:26:06] <oojacoboo> b/c that wasn't working :/
[15:26:14] <shoky> oojacoboo: when you modify some div in a page, do you need to "add that div back to the original object"? no
[15:26:23] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: <a> doesn't use src
[15:26:26] <sunbeam> argh yea
[15:26:27] <sunbeam> just found
[15:26:29] <sunbeam> sorry
[15:26:33] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: it uses href
[15:26:34] <shoky> oojacoboo: sure , $(this).append would work
[15:26:38] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: happens man
[15:27:04] <oojacoboo> shoky, I think the issue was b/c I didn't string find() and each()
[15:27:12] <oojacoboo> therefore, it created 2 objects
[15:27:12] <ryanneufeld_> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/LGShu/3/
[15:27:18] <oojacoboo> b/c each was assigned to it's own var
[15:27:37] <shoky> donno what you did ;>
[15:27:38] <noregret> any idea of online tool that can convert a serialized string into normal text ?
[15:27:58] <shoky> "a serialized string" ? "normal text" ?
[15:28:18] <noregret> shoky: i mean a string with converted special chars
[15:28:32] <shoky> "!@#$%^" like that?
[15:28:41] <shoky> the ! represesnts A
[15:28:44] <shoky> etc.
[15:28:45] <noregret> shoky: yesh
[15:28:47] <shoky> very special./
[15:28:52] <noregret> no
[15:29:08] <shoky> ok, ask a real question
[15:29:51] <noregret> shoky: i mean such as: data%5BSpam%5D%5Bselect%5D=1&data%5BSpam%5D%5Bselect%5D=3 i just want to reconstruct the characters here (such as the '[' and ']')

[15:30:43] <bot-t> shoky: "data[Spam][select]=1&data[Spam][select]=3"
[15:31:22] <noregret> ok cooll
[15:31:37] <shoky> noregret: the URI encoding of the characters here has nothing to do with serialization. dont confuse terms ;p
[15:31:47] <someprimetime> i'm putting an html element within an object and i want to know if it's possible to re-query within the object itself?
[15:32:31] <noregret> shoky: yeah true :)
[15:32:59] <noregret> shoky: this is cool http://www.neoegm.com/tag/decodeuricomponent/ =)
[15:33:02] <shoky> someprimetime: you'd have to elaborate
[15:33:21] <shoky> noregret: you have it in your browser, you know
[15:33:30] <shoky> noregret: dont need to go to a special site ;]
[15:33:45] <shoky> F12 plz
[15:34:09] <noregret> ah, forgot about firebug
[15:34:29] <shoky> dont forget about your browser devtools if you are doing webdev
[15:34:40] <oojacoboo> cohitre, the issue is that it only returns the changes within the loop for template
[15:34:46] <shoky> they are like.. the most important thing, for productivity
[15:35:23] <noregret> shoky: yeah i know, but using it for that purposer just slipped my mind, i always use the browser tools
[15:35:49] <shoky> k ;P
[15:37:46] <cohitre> oojacoboo: http://pastebin.com/6XRrcUD4
[15:37:57] <cohitre> oojacoboo: line 68 and line 77
[15:38:04] <noregret> anyway, back to my problem, serializing the form with just the checkboxes gives too much unwanted noise
[15:38:20] <noregret> where I only want to send their valus somehow
[15:38:26] <oojacoboo> cohitre, I see
[15:38:33] <oojacoboo> can you explain why?
[15:38:58] <someprimetime> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/7Mdvc/
[15:39:27] <cohitre> oojacoboo: also, i screwed up. http://pastebin.com/qYTNP9aB
[15:39:32] <someprimetime> basically on initial creation of that object, the list is empty. when i add stuff to the list, it'll grow in size but i need to know how to re-query gallerySelectors.$selectableListItems
[15:39:47] <cohitre> i already explained why before. $(someString) returns an object that is not someString
[15:40:29] <oojacoboo> cohitre, yes, but I tried $(someString).html()
[15:40:33] <oojacoboo> would that not be correct?
[15:40:41] <shoky> someprimetime: if you want to re-query you have to run another selection. e.g. $(...)
[15:40:48] <someprimetime> shoky: bummer that's what i thought
[15:40:50] <someprimetime> thanks
[15:41:32] <shoky> someprimetime: you're selecing the <ul> again anyway
[15:41:52] <shoky> twice even ;p
[15:42:04] <someprimetime> yeah this was a bad example i just abstracted it from my code
[15:42:09] <someprimetime> i guess i got the answer i was looking for anyway
[15:42:20] <shoky> okz
[15:42:26] <someprimetime> i was trying to put all selectors in one object though for simplicity
[15:42:48] <shoky> so put the selector strings themselves
[15:42:51] <someprimetime> cause i'm sick of caching the same variables
[15:42:54] <shoky> not the jq object that already did the selection
[15:42:56] <someprimetime> that's kinda smart
[15:42:58] <someprimetime> +1
[15:43:00] <shoky> ;p
[15:43:15] <someprimetime> but then it's not as easy as going gallerySelector.editCount or w/e
[15:43:16] <someprimetime> haha
[15:43:24] <cohitre> oojacoboo: http://pastebin.com/VQyiqBTP
[15:43:38] <cohitre> there you go. it has much less code. should be easy to understand.
[15:44:28] <someprimetime> shoky: actually i guess it's ok if i just need to wrap it with $()
[15:44:29] <someprimetime> ha
[15:45:01] <oojacoboo> cohitre, yea, I get it, I just don't understand why I needed to set it to a new var, if I was attempting… $(template).find().each() then returning $(template).html();
[15:45:13] <oojacoboo> I appreciate the insight, just would love some clarify there for my own sanity
[15:45:20] <atdt> i have a handler, bound using jQuery.one(), that preventDefault()s and then attempts to re-trigger the original event using setTimeout. But it seems like the event is always getting preventDefault()ed, even though the handler is only executing once.
[15:45:35] <someprimetime> $(gallerySelectors.editableListItems) meh not bad
[15:46:14] <cohitre> oojacoboo: because every time you call $(template) you get a new instance of a jQuery object. luckily, modifying one instance will leave the other ones untouched.
[15:46:32] <Axsuul> Does anyone know of a reliable way to determine if a picture has been loaded or not?
[15:46:44] <oojacoboo> cohitre, AH… yea… makes sense, got it
[15:46:46] <oojacoboo> thank you
[15:48:21] <shoky> atdt: seems fine here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/G9HFZ/
[15:48:37] <shoky> ah i forgot to retrigger it ;S
[15:48:53] <gaspyr> awesome fiddle :D
[15:49:05] <min|dvir|us> Where can I look at the implementation of built-in easing functions?
[15:49:30] <gaspyr> everything should be available in jquery source code
[15:51:54] <min|dvir|us> easing: fn && easing || easing && !jQuery.isFunction( easing ) && easing
[15:52:07] <min|dvir|us> That's fucking disgusting.
[15:52:17] <Es0teric> lmao
[15:52:40] <shoky> it's not supposed to be pretty, it's supposed to be small ;p
[15:52:49] <min|dvir|us> shoky, what does it mean?
[15:52:59] <shoky> that line?
[15:53:19] <min|dvir|us> shoky, wrap the binary operations with parentheses.
[15:54:04] <gaspyr> either fn and easing ---- or easing
[15:54:09] <shoky> i donno, it'd be easier with context
[15:54:15] <shoky> don't feel like trying to guess at it
[15:54:28] <min|dvir|us> shoky, you can Ctrl+F that line in http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js
[15:54:44] <shoky> oh i was thinking jqui
[15:55:27] <shoky> so, are you asking what it means cause you wanna know, or cause you want to prove its disgusting? :p
[15:55:35] <shoky> just so i know if to attempt to decipher ;p
[15:55:49] <min|dvir|us> shoky, well, everyone already knows it's disgusting, so no proof needed there.
[15:55:55] <shoky> k
[15:56:35] <gaspyr> i think it's quite ok compared to how pure js is kinda disgusting :D
[15:56:49] <noregret> is there any way to obtain all checkbox values in one string ? like $(:checked).val(all) or something xD
[15:56:52] <min|dvir|us> gaspyr, that is pure JS.
[15:57:15] <cohitre> ? map @ noregret
[15:57:15] <bot-t> noregret, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[15:57:27] <gaspyr> everything is pure js, but imeant it is not pure pure :)
[15:57:42] <noregret> cohitre: cool
[15:57:43] <min|dvir|us> ? reduce @ noregret
[15:57:43] <bot-t> noregret, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[15:57:45] <cohitre> noregret: then call .get() on what .map returns to convert it into an array
[15:57:49] <min|dvir|us> Wrong thing.
[15:57:55] <min|dvir|us> noregret, look up reduce(). That's what you want.
[15:58:08] <noregret> lol
[15:58:20] <gaspyr> yp use get if u wanna switch from jquery object to a NodeList
[15:58:42] <noregret> min|dvir|us: can't see it in the docs
[15:58:46] <gaspyr> when u do that u can also change room to #NodeList :D
[15:58:57] <min|dvir|us> noregret, it's Underscore.js.
[15:59:28] <min|dvir|us> shoky, so are you going to answer?
[16:00:17] <noregret> min|dvir|us: what ? you lost me
[16:01:03] <shoky> min|dvir|us: hold on ;>
[16:01:12] <gaspyr> is there an offline downloadable version of jquery's api doc ?
[16:02:14] <min|dvir|us> http://underscorejs.org/#reduce: _.reduce($('.boxes'), function ($box) { return $box.val(); }, '');
[16:02:48] <min|dvir|us> http://underscorejs.org/#reduce: _.reduce($('.boxes'), function (memo, $box) { return memo + $box.val(); }, '');
[16:03:32] <gaspyr> is there one ?
[16:03:37] <shoky> ok min|dvir|us i got it :P
[16:03:42] <shoky> easing: (fn && easing) || ( easing && !jQuery.isFunction( easing ) && easing )
[16:03:54] <min|dvir|us> shoky, ( easing && !jQuery.isFunction( easing ) && easing ) doesn't make sense.
[16:04:01] <shoky> it does
[16:04:09] <shoky> because if easing is a function
[16:04:12] <min|dvir|us> !jQuery.isFunction( easing ) && easing is equivalent.
[16:04:14] <shoky> then its not really the easing,
[16:04:18] <shoky> it's the callback
[16:04:25] <shoky> which was already put into 'complete'
[16:04:45] <shoky> what do you mean it's equivalent?
[16:04:55] <gaspyr> shoky, do u know if there's a downloadable version of jquery's doc ?
[16:05:11] <min|dvir|us> shoky, how could having "easing &&" prepended make any difference in the function?
[16:05:17] <shoky> ah min|dvir|us:  it's for speedup i assume
[16:05:25] <shoky> er
[16:05:35] <shoky> not sure
[16:05:53] <shoky> either for speedup (dont check if its a function if its not even a valid value)
[16:08:08] <min|dvir|us> shoky, this is definitely not optimized.
[16:08:37] <min|dvir|us> (fn || !jQuery.isFunction( easing )) && easing does the exact same thing.
[16:10:15] <min|dvir|us> Can a jQuery dev who's around tell me what this line of code is doing that I can't see?
[16:10:37] <shoky> min|dvir|us: if fn == undefined,
[16:10:51] <shoky> and easing is also undefined
[16:11:02] <shoky> then what you wrote will call jQuery.isFunction(undefined)
[16:11:09] <min|dvir|us> It would anyway.
[16:11:12] <shoky> but the ugly line wouldn't
[16:11:13] <min|dvir|us> Oh, I see.
[16:11:26] <min|dvir|us> Yeah, you're right.
[16:11:41] <min|dvir|us> Is that function really expensive or something? Isn't it just typeof easing == 'function'?
[16:11:49] <shoky> it calls jquery.type
[16:11:58] <shoky> which is:
[16:11:58] <shoky> return obj == null ?
[16:11:58] <shoky> 			String( obj ) :
[16:11:58] <shoky> 			class2type[ core_toString.call(obj) ] || "object";
[16:12:04] <min|dvir|us> Oh damn.
[16:12:11] <shoky> aye
[16:12:18] <min|dvir|us> Maybe this code is just really optimized.
[16:12:35] <shoky> that's what we (dont) pay em for!
[16:12:44] <min|dvir|us> I mean, wow.
[16:12:47] <min|dvir|us> To do that intentionally.
[16:13:19] <min|dvir|us> You guys are geniuses, wherever you are.
[16:14:34] <shoky> ++
[16:15:22] <gaspyr> hmm weird, but how can it be more optimized
[16:15:27] <imsky> sup you jailhouse stoolies
[16:15:38] <min|dvir|us> gaspyr, it reduces the probability of calling jQuery.isFunction().
[16:15:39] <shoky> gaspyr: less code is executed
[16:17:00] <gaspyr> after all fro my modest point of view that easing == function is much better than using isFunction which behinds the scences shud be smthg like function isFunction(elem){ return Object.prototype.toString().call(elem) == "[Object Function]";}
[16:17:41] <min|dvir|us> gaspyr, easing == function accomplishes what?
[16:18:17] <gaspyr> regarding the comparison of wether easing is of type function or not
[16:18:27] <gaspyr> and yea forgot to add typeof :s
[16:21:22] <min|dvir|us> The default easing function: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=graph+theta%3D%28+-cos%28+r*PI+%29+%2F+2+%29+%2B+0.5+from+0+to+1

[16:24:33] <someprimetime> $('#div').click(function() { $(this).css('-moz-box-shadow', 'whatever'); }); ?
[16:24:47] <someprimetime> or whatever the box-shadow css property is
[16:24:55] <someprimetime> yo no tengo dinero
[16:25:01] <min|dvir|us> $('div').click(function () { $(this).css({boxShadow: '10px 10px 10px black'}); });

[16:30:39] <istvan> hello all - I am using jscrollpane for custom scrollbars. Inside the scrolled-div there are several child divs. How can I get the ID of the topmost visible div?
[16:32:06] <min|dvir|us> How do I get the default jQuery easing function?
[16:37:06] <Mrpeepers310> Good evening everyone! I am trying to create a login function that will return a boolean. For some reason the function is not returning any values. Here is my code http://pastebin.com/8y0YMmc7
[16:38:42] <Mrpeepers310> Hello?
[16:42:10] <min|dvir|us> Can someone explain what jQuery.speed() does?
[16:47:29] <LoneStar99> what is the opposite of ".scroll()" like when user focus is not on scroller?
[16:51:36] <sacho> scroll events aren't fired "when the user focus is on the scroller"
[16:51:46] <sacho> the scroller doesn't even have a focus
[16:53:03] <lancealtar> ?.speed min|dvir|us
[16:53:04] <bot-t> lancealtar, Couldn't find ".speed min|dvir|us" in jQuery Docs.
[16:53:10] <lancealtar> ?.speed() min|dvir|us
[16:53:11] <min|dvir|us> lancealtar, it's undocumented.
[16:53:11] <bot-t> lancealtar, Couldn't find ".speed() min|dvir|us" in jQuery Docs.
[16:53:17] <lancealtar> boo
[16:53:35] <sacho> there's no such function
[16:53:42] <min|dvir|us> sacho, that's not true.
[16:54:10] <min|dvir|us> $.speed() -- try it.
[16:54:16] <LoneStar99> sacho i have the folloing --> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Dn8gL/  want the box-shadow to dissappear when user is not on scroller ...
[16:54:44] <min|dvir|us> LoneStar99, oh, wow.
[16:55:04] <min|dvir|us> LoneStar99, .scroll() means on the scroll event.
[16:55:08] <min|dvir|us> Which can be triggered via middle mouse.
[16:55:16] <min|dvir|us> Or by dragging the scroll bar.
[16:55:21] <sacho> LoneStar99, so think when a user isn't on the scroller.
[16:55:22] <min|dvir|us> What you want is .hover().
[16:55:56] <min|dvir|us> I don't know if you can use the scroll bar, though.
[16:56:34] <min|dvir|us> `$(document).ready(function() {` should be `jQuery(function ($) {`.
[16:57:22] <eggsby> why min|dvir|us ?
[16:57:33] <LoneStar99> min|dvir|us: ok let me make that fix
[16:57:48] <eggsby> why is the shorthand better than explictly using .ready against the document?
[16:57:50] <min|dvir|us> eggsby, prevents an overridden $, and is shorter.
[16:58:18] <min|dvir|us> eggsby, it's a matter of taste, but my taste is better than everyone's.
[16:58:43] <psyolus> Anyone here familiar with jQTouch?
[17:00:05] <min|dvir|us> eggsby, now that I think about it, jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { might be better, because it is explicit.
[17:06:11] <tomasm-> hi, how do I trigger a jquery dialog() to resize the height to fit the content? isn't there an event to trigger? I've set 'autoResize' as an option and omitted 'height' as an option, but it still imposes scrollbars instead of autogrowing
[17:07:09] <LoneStar99> brb
[17:07:19] <gaspyr> tomasm here
[17:07:26] <gaspyr> 1 sec i up a fiddle
[17:08:26] <tomasm-> autoResize seems deprecated anyway
[17:12:20] <gaspyr> http://jsfiddle.net/AqGvN/
[17:12:21] <tomasm-> gaspyr, I know I can close the dialog and open it again (which may also prevent the window from opening offset by getting the size before it shows anyway)
[17:12:39] <gaspyr> there u go, copy the html and try it
[17:12:54] <knite> I'm using select2 with an ajax call for data. how can I split that data into optgroups?
[17:13:09] <tomasm-> gaspyr, no, not resizable by the user, but once scrollbars get introduced, to resize it automatically (via js) to fit w/o scrollbars
[17:13:36] <Es0teric> whats better? the modal from jquery ui or the modal from bootstrap?
[17:13:54] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I like Bootstrap.
[17:14:03] <gaspyr> ahh
[17:14:17] <Es0teric> yeah im thinking of switching over, min|dvir|us
[17:14:44] <min|dvir|us> If jQuery UI were more of a full-fledged toolkit, I might use it.
[17:14:51] <min|dvir|us> Still ugly compared to Bootstrap.
[17:15:06] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us im thinking of switching to bootstrap because i want the modal to stay floating after the form is submitted
[17:15:11] <eggsby> there's always http://addyosmani.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap/
[17:16:17] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, well, Bootstrap will reskin your shit.
[17:16:30] <gaspyr> @tomasm, do u want the content to be reseted by js to fit in page without scroll need ?
[17:16:36] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us i can manage that
[17:16:54] <tomasm-> gaspyr, yes, to resize to eliminate the scrollbar... i know there's a way to do it with dialog()
[17:19:24] <tomasm-> hmmm, shoot, i think this isnt working because it's using an iframe!
[17:20:54] <shoky> bot-t, tell Whirl3d i didn't really get what he was referencing (apeshit) ;P
[17:20:55] <bot-t> shoky, Okay.
[17:26:15] <raj> Eviltwin, if there's no time data, it is just blank instead of '0 seconds'
[17:26:51] <shoky> fix it!
[17:26:57] <Eviltwin> raj: Which one?
[17:27:10] <raj> this sexy little thing http://jsfiddle.net/gKPeL/2/
[17:27:43] <Eviltwin> And what do you mean by "no time data"?
[17:28:12] <Eviltwin> You mean 0?
[17:28:42] <raj> cuz when I initialize the timer on page load-->   $qtimer.timer(function(seconds) {
[17:28:45] <raj>     this.text(humanTime(seconds))
[17:28:47] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/gKPeL/3/
[17:28:47] <raj> })
[17:28:50] <Eviltwin> Boom
[17:28:52] <Eviltwin> 0 -> "0 seconds"
[17:29:07] <raj> but it doesn't show 0 either
[17:29:19] <Eviltwin> I don't follow
[17:29:22] <Eviltwin> Look at the console
[17:29:30] <Eviltwin> "0 seconds" "1 second" "2 seconds" ...
[17:29:42] <raj> it's just blank
[17:29:48] <raj> omg, it just starts counting up!
[17:29:54] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/gKPeL/3/
[17:30:46] <raj> i did console.log(humanTime(seconds)) within $qtimer.timer(function(seconds) { /*here*/}) and it's jsut counting up blank ouputs in my console
[17:31:03] <Eviltwin> Yes, note the 3 at the end of the jsFiddle URL instead of the 2
[17:31:52] <raj> now it's just console.log "0 seconds" continuously
[17:32:11] <raj> *console.logging
[17:32:15] <Eviltwin> What if you do console.log(seconds)
[17:32:39] <raj> oh yeah
[17:32:41] <raj> it's the function
[17:32:53] <raj> it's just doing 0 continuously then
[17:33:04] <raj> so it's the .timer() itself
[17:34:34] <Eviltwin> Well if you want help debugging that, you should probably show a jsFiddle :P
[17:34:36] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/aSfEB/17
[17:35:18] <Eviltwin> Okay
[17:35:20] <Eviltwin> Looks fine here
[17:37:46] <raj> $(function(){ $timer.timer(function(seconds){ console.log(seconds) }) })
[17:37:52] <raj> it just counts up forever
[17:38:00] <raj> sorry, not count up
[17:38:21] <raj> but console.logs '0' for infinity
[17:39:20] <knite> could someone with more javascript fu look at https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/commit/55fd00169e344cfb3f49f062dc317416ba05be15 ? I'm having trouble figuring out how to modify my results ajax to support grouping.
[17:39:21] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on select2 by Igor Vaynberg (1w, 6d ago): simplify optgroup querying and rendering code. provide a more powerful populateResults() function fixes #58. fixes #105. fixes #84
[17:39:48] <knite> and it's not mentioned in the docs afaik.
[17:40:00] <raj> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/aSfEB/18/
[17:40:26] <raj> check out console
[17:40:27] <systemfault> lol 800 lines of code....
[17:41:48] <Eviltwin> Okay, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/aSfEB/19/
[17:42:16] <Eviltwin> The reason you were getting that is because it was redrawing every animation frame whether or not it was running
[17:42:46] <Eviltwin> Theoretically that version should only do that while it's running
[17:42:52] <Eviltwin> And once after resetting/stopping
[17:42:57] <gaspyr> @tomasm = http://aamirafridi.com/jquery/jquery-equal-columns-height-plugin  ?
[17:43:25] <Eviltwin> I was going to explain the problem and see if you could figure out how to fix it as an exercise
[17:43:33] <Eviltwin> But it took me like a minute tops
[17:44:26] <raj> works just as you said, including the stop/reset thing
[17:44:30] <raj> thank you :)
[17:47:42] <ElderFain> I know htere is a way to do this but I don't know what its called. once i snag an element like $('#element') i want to call several different things on it, like $(this).css(blahblah); $(this).text(blahblah)
[17:48:18] <ElderFain> so i want to invoke a callback on the element once i get it, but all the examples i find involve a callback inside another function, like $('#element').mouseover(function() { //do in here })
[17:48:40] <ElderFain> just drop it in an each?
[17:53:00] <wavez> I have a function that fades out a visible div and fades in a hidden div. It works, except if the viewer double clicks on the area, then it causes both divs to fade out.
[17:53:39] <wavez> It seems to do fadeOut(), fadeIn(), fadeOut(), so then both are gone.
[17:54:00] <wavez> I'm not sure how to control this.
[17:54:12] <tomasm-> ElderFain, some stuff can be chained like().this().here(), but some stuff needs to be nested with callbacks, ie stuff that's asynchronous
[17:54:16] <johnkpaul> wavez: use stop()
[17:54:18] <johnkpaul> ?stop @wavez
[17:54:18] <bot-t> wavez, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[17:55:14] <MysterOnyx> not sure if this is a jquery or css question... is there a way to make a div have a default size, and then when more things are added to it, it expands in size? I know that divs will auto expand, but I want it to start off empty and with a designated size
[17:56:20] <wavez> johnkpaul, when should the code call stop? After the fadeIn()? My code calls fadeOut(); fadeIn();, so I would just put stop(); at the end of the function?
[17:56:22] <evansiegel> hey everyone, if I have this address: http://YOUR_REGISTERED_REDIRECT_URI/#access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN, how do I save the access_token?
[17:56:24] <evansiegel> thanks
[17:56:29] <johnkpaul> wavez: before the fadeX()
[17:56:38] <johnkpaul> .stop().fadeIn() .stop().fadeOut()
[17:56:58] <wavez> okay, thanks
[17:57:03] <tomasm-> MysterOnyx, that's css, and it will automatically expand height, unless you have a fixed height and overflow
[17:58:10] <evansiegel> MysterOnyx, you can set a min-height for the element in CSS. that will allow the element to become as large as you'd like, but no smaller than the set size
[17:58:26] <min|dvir|us> wavez, you probably want stop(true).
[17:58:34] <johnkpaul> no problem wavez
[17:58:59] <Es0teric> if you want to fade in json content.... you do it in the callback right?
[17:59:02] <wavez> crap, that's not working for me either.
[17:59:05] <Es0teric> well content from getJSON
[17:59:24] <wavez> I'll pastebin the code
[17:59:27] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, yes. The callback is the function jQuery executes when content has been returned.
[17:59:32] <wavez> it's a 2 line function
[17:59:45] <min|dvir|us> wavez, what is its purpose?
[18:00:13] <wavez> min|dvir|us, one div fades out while another fades in behind it
[18:00:27] <min|dvir|us> wavez, you want position:absolute.
[18:00:58] <wavez> They are both styled that way
[18:01:00] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us what if i want fade in content that has been appended in the getJSON?
[18:01:10] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, not sure what that means.
[18:01:24] <Es0teric> like lets say i have $('container ul').append("<li>" + var1 + "</li>");
[18:01:26] <min|dvir|us> wavez, what's the problem?
[18:01:39] <Es0teric> how do i fade in that .append?
[18:02:06] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, .append($('<li>').text(var1).hide().fadeIn());
[18:03:26] <wavez> min|dvir|us, when the viewer does a double click, fadeOut is called again, leaving both divs hidden.
[18:03:27] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/KZvbdtYn
[18:03:40] <min|dvir|us> wavez, use JSfiddle.
[18:04:27] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us what is the .hide() for in that?
[18:04:44] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, so that it starts out hidden, rather than fading in from an already visible state.
[18:05:03] <Es0teric> OHHH that makes sense
[18:05:05] <Es0teric> ok ok
[18:05:51] <min|dvir|us> wavez, sounds like a race condition.
[18:06:00] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us i didnt know you can use .append() as .append($("#divid").method_1().method_2());
[18:06:04] <min|dvir|us> wavez, I'd change div:visible/hidden.
[18:06:16] <min|dvir|us> Use .front and .back instead, and toggle('slow').
[18:06:34] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, append() can take any value.
[18:06:38] <evansiegel> what's the proper way to use $.get()?
[18:06:56] <min|dvir|us> evansiegel, do you mean $.get() or $().get()?
[18:07:30] <min|dvir|us> To be more explicit, the latter is $(selector).get().
[18:07:31] <evansiegel> I'm 95% sure that I mean $.get(), but what I want to do is GET something passed by the URL
[18:07:31] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us so the way you used append is the best way to chain methods right?
[18:07:42] <min|dvir|us> evansiegel, yes, that's right.
[18:07:51] <min|dvir|us> evansiegel, it's documented right there.
[18:07:59] <wavez> min|dvir|us, I don't understand. I can't use .front and .back because they change rolls.
[18:08:06] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, what's interesting isn't my usage of .append().
[18:08:08] <wavez> roles
[18:08:22] <min|dvir|us> wavez, then use .one and .two.
[18:08:42] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, $(selector).foo().bar() is just a value.
[18:08:52] <min|dvir|us> What's interesting is chaining.
[18:09:08] <Es0teric> so then how would i chain?
[18:09:12] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us
[18:09:13] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, .foo().bar().
[18:09:24] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, the point I'm making is that append() accepts one argument.
[18:09:32] <wavez> min|dvir|us, so you're saying to change the class of the objects after the fadeOut(); fadeIn(); ?
[18:09:41] <min|dvir|us> ? No.
[18:09:44] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, no transport error on Windows Phone 7 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10660
[18:09:47] <min|dvir|us> wavez, it sounded to me like you had a problem with the class names.
[18:09:47] <wavez> and select based on the class?
[18:09:51] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us ah i see... so i can chain in that one argument
[18:09:52] <wavez> no
[18:09:56] <Es0teric> right?
[18:10:12] <wavez> I'll put it on jsfiddle
[18:10:28] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, right, you can chain anywhere in JS that an expression should be.
[18:10:44] <min|dvir|us> An expression is JS code which, when executed, has a value.
[18:11:01] <min|dvir|us> Unlike for() {}, which is a statement.
[18:11:03] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us so.. you mean like.. .typeof() or .text() right?
[18:11:10] <evansiegel> right, I'm having a bit of trouble making the documentation into practical, working $.get(). I'm just not sure how to reference the window that I'm in… $.get(window.location.href, function() { // success function }); ?
[18:11:13] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, right; the return values of those functions are expressions.
[18:11:20] <Es0teric> i see i see
[18:11:25] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, and arguments are always expressions.
[18:11:48] <min|dvir|us> evansiegel, that looks right to me.
[18:11:57] <evansiegel> alright, thanks!
[18:11:57] <Es0teric> so whats returned is a value and an expression is the procedure thats executed to get the value right, min|dvir|us ?
[18:12:07] <min|dvir|us> evansiegel, ... really? You didn't try?
[18:12:30] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, the return value is an expression.
[18:12:54] <Es0teric> hmm ok
[18:13:06] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, consider `(function returnFour() { return 4; }());`.
[18:13:21] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, in this example, returnFour, 4, and the entire example are expressions.
[18:13:21] <Es0teric> thats a self-invoking function
[18:14:04] <evansiegel> Of course I tried? Why would I ask the question before I tried?
[18:14:16] <Es0teric> so its an expression because its wrapped around the anonymous function, min|dvir|us ?
[18:14:35] <Es0teric> thus returning the value?
[18:14:49] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, to which of [returnFour, 4, the entire example] are you referring?
[18:15:30] <wavez> min|dvir|us, http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/DV2CB/
[18:15:33] <Es0teric> ok i am trying to wrap my head around this.. the value is whats returned, right? so if i do console.log((function returnFour() { return 4; }())); and see 4 printed out, thats the value
[18:15:45] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, right, which is also an expression.
[18:15:47] <wavez> min|dvir|us, it works if you single click. Double click and it fails.
[18:16:01] <min|dvir|us> wavez, click "Update".
[18:16:05] <Es0teric> so the value is whats printed out and the expression is whats used to get the value, right min|dvir|us ?
[18:16:24] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, the value IS an expression.
[18:16:24] <wavez> min|dvir|us, http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/DV2CB/1/
[18:16:33] <Es0teric> AHHH ok ok
[18:16:43] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, there are exactly 3 expressions in the example.
[18:17:21] <Es0teric> well, min|dvir|us i can only think of the anonymous function, the function itself (returnfour()) and thats it
[18:17:34] <Es0teric> those would be the expressions
[18:17:36] <min|dvir|us> There is no anonymous function.
[18:17:58] <Es0teric> ohh SNAP
[18:18:02] <Es0teric> Ii was reading that wrong >.>
[18:18:19] <Es0teric> i saw a parenthesis around function returnFour() and thought there was another one
[18:19:10] <eip56> So i have a ul I want to display the first say 5 then float the next 5 to the next column. Any easy way to do this orrrr just write a while first 5 then create a new ul
[18:20:16] <min|dvir|us> eip56, use different containers, or look at CSS columns.
[18:20:25] <eip56> roger
[18:20:29] <eip56> thnx
[18:20:33] <eip56> ^^
[18:20:40] <Es0teric> also, min|dvir|us i have an additional question... i have a getJSON but i want to set a timeout... should i wrap the getJSON in the setTimeout()? or should i wrap setTimeout() in the callback?
[18:20:55] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, when do you want the timeout to happen?
[18:21:14] <Es0teric> after the getJSON request returns data
[18:21:19] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, sounds like you have your answer.
[18:21:26] <Es0teric> so in the callback
[18:21:27] <Es0teric> cool
[18:21:42] <HoUdInI> how do i get to channel #lgesteem-dev
[18:22:48] <Es0teric> 10000 is 10 seconds right?
[18:23:14] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, read the docs.
[18:23:19] <min|dvir|us> Don't ask when you can Google.
[18:25:46] <min|dvir|us> wavez, http://jsfiddle.net/SFs88/
[18:27:58] <Es0teric> yeah i was right...
[18:28:17] <wavez> min|dvir|us, awesome, thanks. But why does this not have the problem that my code had?
[18:28:36] <wavez> Oh, stop().
[18:28:38] <wavez> I see it now
[18:28:41] <min|dvir|us> wavez, that's not it.
[18:28:48] <wavez> ?
[18:28:51] <min|dvir|us> wavez, if you add that to your code it doesn't work.
[18:28:52] <Es0teric> wow.. that timeout is working wonders for me right now...
[18:29:05] <wavez> it's the class selector?
[18:29:12] <min|dvir|us> wavez, I don't know.
[18:29:18] <min|dvir|us> wavez, I didn't spend the time figuring out what was wrong.
[18:29:22] <min|dvir|us> I just rewrote it.
[18:29:24] <wavez> heh
[18:29:26] <wavez> thanks :)
[18:29:43] <wavez> I think you're right, it's caused by trying to select based on visible and hidden
[18:30:22] <min|dvir|us> wavez, I recommend not changing state you depend on.
[18:31:21] <hye> If I have multiple .each statements , do they run concurrently?
[18:31:29] <min|dvir|us> hye, no.
[18:31:39] <hye> I have noticed my second .each is throwing a console message, before my first .each
[18:31:49] <min|dvir|us> hye, JSfiddle?
[18:32:08] <hye> its too complex of a code to fiddle, it ill need to do alot of work just to have it in fiddle shape
[18:32:09] <min|dvir|us> hye, that's literally impossible, unless you're doing async.
[18:33:03] <wavez> min|dvir|us, why do you use function($) ?
[18:33:25] <shoky> he's scared o' mean plugins
[18:33:25] <min|dvir|us> wavez, in case $ is overriden by another library.
[18:33:30] <shoky> er libs.
[18:33:34] <hye> ya definately the second .each is spitting out a result before the first .each
[18:33:35] <hye> crazy
[18:34:01] <hye> let me create a fiddler sample to see if i can reproduce
[18:34:22] <roler> I am using fadeIn and fadeOut. If the content on the first page is scrollable, and I scroll to the bottom, then change the div with .html(' foobar'); then fadeIn, the content is off the screen… If I scroll to the top on the first page, fadeout then fade in, the new content is visible
[18:34:39] <min|dvir|us> roler, JSfiddle.
[18:34:46] <wavez> min|dvir|us, and why the $ in front of the variable names?
[18:34:54] <min|dvir|us> wavez, so you know they're jQuery objectys.
[18:34:56] <min|dvir|us> *objects
[18:35:23] <tomasm-> i have an iframe loaded into a dialog() and i'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to easily resize the dialog so the iframe grows in size and eliminates it's scrollbars? or fits whatever height is needed to not have it in the first place?
[18:35:23] <tomasm-> is it possible for an iframe to not have a fixed height, but be as long as it needs to be? i'll have to poke around the code generating it
[18:36:00] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, what the hell is dialog()?
[18:36:20] <min|dvir|us> Ahh, jQuery UI.
[18:36:26] <wavez> min|dvir|us, this works perfectly. Thanks so much for the help and the explanations and your patience :D
[18:36:48] <hye> i rather work this out on my own then use this stupid js fiddle interface
[18:36:50] <min|dvir|us> wavez, but yes, the takeaway is, don't depend on volatile state.
[18:37:01] <min|dvir|us> hye, I think it's pretty nice, personally.
[18:37:08] <hye> its not working well in ie9
[18:37:13] <min|dvir|us> The editor itself is shitty.
[18:37:24] <hye> ya exactly the editor sucks
[18:37:32] <hye> it wouldnt let me type my syntax so i got frustrated
[18:37:36] <min|dvir|us> hye, so write your code in a different editor and copy/paste.
[18:38:18] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, unfortunately it's much harder to determine the size of an iframe.
[18:39:04] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, Try $($('iframe')[0].contentDocument).width() and .height().
[18:39:27] <min|dvir|us> Or $('body', $('iframe')[0].contentDocument).width() and .height().
[18:39:38] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, I believe the code is already in context of the iframe, so would that be "window"?
[18:39:54] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, `document`.
[18:39:55] <tomasm-> body?
[18:40:20] <hye> min|dvir|us ill keep you posted, i tried a simple version, its executed top down like expected, but my version is not executing from top down for some reason, when i have a nice fiddle ready ill let you know
[18:40:56] <tomasm-> hmmm, what's clientWidth/clientHeight ? is that what width() and height() get it from? or elsewhere?
[18:41:00] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, if it's written in the context of the iframe, you'll have to use $($(window.parent.document)).dialog() to resize from within the iframe's JS context.
[18:41:27] <min|dvir|us> You don't need to double-wrap, silly me.
[18:43:47] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us how do i parse apostrophes in text?
[18:43:56] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, what does parse mean to you?
[18:44:18] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us parse meaning process
[18:44:25] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, a little more specific?
[18:45:31] <Es0teric> because i have a couple of titles with apostrophes in them so right now, on the html it only shows I' or am'.. so it cuts off the rest of the string
[18:45:44] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us
[18:46:10] <tw2113> escape them
[18:46:11] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, put a \ before the ', or use " instead of ' around the string.
[18:46:19] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, that is escaping, not parsing.
[18:46:38] <wathek> hi everybody
[18:46:42] <Es0teric> ok well, min|dvir|us i am getting data from the lastfm api
[18:46:59] <Es0teric> so i need to escape song names and url's that have apostrophies in them
[18:47:29] <wathek> I need some help my ajax function doesn't parse my json response here's my code :http://pastebin.com/VckZrm8K

[18:47:43] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, either it's your text (not lfm's), or the apostrophes aren't the problem.
[18:47:45] <tw2113> hmm
[18:48:22] <otherj> guys, if i want to .toggleclass on the <i> element here, how would i target that? <a href="/sites/toggle/48" class="favdsite" data-remote="true" title="Add site to favorites"><i class="star icon-star icon-white"></i></a>
[18:48:48] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us well... its from lastfm
[18:48:52] <wathek> when I do a console.log(d) it shows that it's an object and returns this : http://pastebin.com/CEu2MTwD and when I try to do d.distance it says that it's undefined
[18:48:54] <wathek> any idea ?
[18:48:55] <Es0teric> some strings arent escaped
[18:49:00] <shoky> otherj: $('i') ?
[18:49:37] <min|dvir|us> otherj, $('a.favdsite[href="/sites/toggle/48"][data-remote="true"][title="Add site to favorites" i.star.icon-star.icon-white').toggleClass();
[18:49:45] <shoky> lol.
[18:49:52] <otherj> dude
[18:50:01] <shoky> you got 2 extreme answers
[18:50:04] <otherj> yeah
[18:50:05] <shoky> find the middle path
[18:50:07] <otherj> haha
[18:50:08] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, what the heck does j(window.parent.document).dialog() do? chrome is giving a hierarchy error - you said to not double wrap, maybe i misinterpreted?
[18:50:10] <otherj> well, thanks
[18:50:13] <shoky> ;]
[18:51:27] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, when you put an apostrophe between <i> tags, does it cut off the remaining text?
[18:51:30] <min|dvir|us> No.
[18:51:45] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, well, how do you initialize the dialog?
[18:52:55] <shoky> wathek: what exactly does the returned json look like?
[18:53:08] <Es0teric> well, min|dvir|us i know this is not good practice but its the <li title="">
[18:53:14] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, maybe window.parent.$('#dialog').dialog() ?
[18:53:46] <tw2113> Es0teric you're going to need to find a way to programmatically escape your quotes before displaying the content to the browser
[18:53:47] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, that would probably work. I was going to say $('#dialog', window.parent.document).dialog().

[18:55:02] <shoky> wathek: ok. that's an array not an object
[18:55:09] <wathek> huh ?
[18:55:24] <shoky> [] around the whole thing, right?
[18:55:36] <wathek> yes
[18:55:42] <shoky> so it's an array.. not an object
[18:55:45] <tw2113> we have a confirmed array
[18:55:55] <otherj> shoky: ok, let me ask this. if i have <a href="blah.html" class="fav">things</a>, how do i target the things part in the link with attr? or should i use attr?
[18:55:58] <shoky> you need to return a json object
[18:56:34] <shoky> wathek, like:  {'mydata': [...that array you pasted...] }
[18:56:36] <min|dvir|us> Tango niner niner, have confirmed bogey array on the horizon. Permission to fire.
[18:56:40] <shoky> "mydata"*
[18:57:15] <wathek> shoky, it's strange cause in my PHP Code I got this : http://pastebin.com/dscipP9y
[18:57:29] <wathek> shoky, it should returns a json object shouldn't it ?
[18:57:29] <Es0teric> tw2113 yeah you're right..
[18:57:34] <tomasm-> hmmm. i'm trying to change the size of an iframe from within the iframe, but setting $(document).height(h) doesnt work....
[18:57:59] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, is this code executed in the iframe, or in the parent?
[18:58:09] <shoky> wathek: i dont know php .. but $result = array() looks like an array :P  though i do recall that that's also how you'd make a json object in php, donno
[18:58:43] <Es0teric> is it possible to do $(this).text() in .append()?
[18:59:04] <shoky> tias
[18:59:29] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, in JS, `this` is a special name. Keep that in mind.
[18:59:58] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us yes i know... i was saying $(this) would be refencing the .append()
[19:00:14] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, that's most likely not what it would reference.
[19:00:33] <Es0teric> yeah it would reference the function its in
[19:00:46] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, no, it would reference the `this` value for the function it's in.
[19:01:15] <Es0teric> i see
[19:01:35] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, JS rules regarding `this` are a bit confusing.
[19:02:02] <Es0teric> well, min|dvir|us i am trying to find a way to grab the string and escape it somehow
[19:02:24] <min|dvir|us> var string = $thing.text();
[19:02:46] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us no, its because i am doing a for-in loop
[19:03:01] <min|dvir|us> OK, I can't help further without a JSfiddle.
[19:03:13] <Es0teric> i had a fiddle before..
[19:03:22] <Es0teric> if i cant figure this out i'll fiddle it in a few
[19:03:34] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, I seem to have some success by just accessing window.parent and grab the iframe from there, changing it's height()/width() ... ie window.parent.$('#'+tinyMCEPopup.id+"_ifr).height(document.body.clientHeight+10)
[19:04:05] <min|dvir|us> tomasm-, great!
[19:04:39] <tomasm-> min|dvir|us, thanks for the help, this has been frustrating me all evening
[19:05:00] <min|dvir|us> Not sure what I did. :)
[19:06:00] <Es0teric> can $(this) reference a for-in loop?
[19:06:16] <tw2113> Es0teric wouldn't necessarily hurt to just regex the strings and replace with single quote html entities
[19:06:18] <shoky> :\
[19:06:28] <shoky> Es0teric: rephrase your question
[19:06:34] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I would recommend learning more about `this`.
[19:07:00] <min|dvir|us> `this` is always window, unless you're calling a method, or the function was called using .call or .apply.
[19:07:21] <shoky> (or bound with .bind)
[19:09:09] <tomasm-> w00t w00t w00t!
[19:09:16] <Es0teric> yeah, there we go... got it
[19:09:21] <Es0teric> .replace() works
[19:09:22] <shoky> hm
[19:09:30] <converge> Im using lazy load plugin with easy slider here http://www.fortunata.com.br/catalogo/ , but it just work with the first 2 imagens, can someone help me ?
[19:09:40] <shoky> ?eval (function(a,b,c){}).length
[19:09:41] <bot-t> shoky: 3
[19:09:45] <Es0teric> i can do .replace("'", "&apos;");
[19:09:47] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I'd do things differently.
[19:09:56] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us how so?
[19:10:09] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, $('<li>').attr({title: lastFMContent}); will autoescape.
[19:10:28] <Es0teric> wow
[19:10:32] <tomasm-> is it possible to make a dialog() with a fixed position? so if the underlying page is scrolled, the dialog stays exactly in the middle, not scrolling away?
[19:10:33] <Es0teric> i hadnt thought of that..
[19:10:33] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, avoid string-building.
[19:12:05] <Es0teric> well, min|dvir|us http://pastebin.com/X6XirDbZ
[19:12:14] <Es0teric> i agree that is a mess
[19:12:20] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I don't want to see this shit.
[19:12:32] <min|dvir|us> Use JSfiddle, and don't build strings.
[19:14:13] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, $('#container ul.append(a
[19:14:15] <min|dvir|us> Whoops.
[19:14:43] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, $('#container ul').append($('<a>').append($('<li>').append($('img').src(blah))));
[19:14:53] <min|dvir|us> .src isn't a real function.
[19:19:31] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us ok ok
[19:19:47] <gf4> IT LOOKS LIKE A REAL FUNCTION
[19:24:27] <blackbean> exit
[19:32:48] <raj> msg nickerv mypass123
[19:33:15] <min|dvir|us> Nice.
[19:33:32] <dmnd> is it bad practice to write to the event argument in an event handler for the purpose of communicating with any event handlers that are triggered later in the bubbling process?
[19:34:09] <dmnd> I ask because while normal event args seem to be mutable, any changes I make to jquery's event wrapper thing don't show up later
[19:34:19] <dmnd> which makes me think perhaps I am doing it wrong
[19:38:53] <Dr-Bombay> dmnd: a separate shared variable seems like a better option
[19:39:52] <dmnd> Dr-Bombay: I considered having both handlers close over a shared variable but it couples them too tightly
[19:40:09] <dmnd> the event args seems like a perfect spot to do this
[19:40:10] <Dr-Bombay> but your whole purpose is to couple them
[19:42:10] <dmnd> coupling isn't a binary thing, there are degrees
[19:42:37] <dmnd> doing it that way would mean I need to have a global, or pass a reference around through my program
[19:43:08] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, well, unless you're a masochist, having a global shouldn't be an option.
[19:43:42] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: I agree
[19:43:48] <min|dvir|us> So it sounds like you're stuck with what the rest of us are -- passing references.
[19:44:00] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, which you're doing using the event object.
[19:44:51] <dmnd> global to all handlers for that event is not the usual definition of a global varaible
[19:44:54] <Dr-Bombay> there's no problem with having a global if the problem calls for a global
[19:45:12] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, what kind of problems do you deal with that call for globals?
[19:45:28] <Dr-Bombay> mindvirus: sharing data between unrelated scopes
[19:46:04] <Dr-Bombay> I'm not the one "dealing" with such problems, dmnd is
[19:46:06] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, an example?
[19:46:25] <Dr-Bombay> mindvirus: I'm not going to get into a sperg fight with you
[19:46:30] <min|dvir|us> ...
[19:46:39] <min|dvir|us> I just don't know what you mean.
[19:46:41] <dmnd> let me give my example since you guys seem interested
[19:47:04] <dmnd> there is a delegated event on body that closes a dropdown menu on a click to the body
[19:47:15] <dmnd> *closes all dropdown menus
[19:47:52] <dmnd> if I have a dropdown menu with a fancy control that needs to accept a click, I have to stop the delegated event (which is part of a library) from closing the menu
[19:48:28] <dmnd> originally I was calling stopPropagation(), but that ended up breaking other delegated event handlers
[19:48:34] <dmnd> (unrelated ones)
[19:49:07] <dmnd> so my solution was to add a property to the event argument called "leaveMenuOpen" which menu item click handlers can set if they wat to prevent the delegated hadnler from closing
[19:50:17] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, I think there's a way to detach an event handler from an event.
[19:50:26] <min|dvir|us> $(selector).unbind(event).
[19:50:44] <dmnd> right, I don't understand where you are suggesting to do that
[19:50:56] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, wherever you're setting leaveMenuOpen.
[19:50:58] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us what is wrong with this right here? http://pastebin.com/hxJkbjEa it is not outputting any of the results
[19:51:10] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, what did I tell you about JSfiddle?
[19:51:15] <Es0teric> dude
[19:51:17] <Es0teric> its just that
[19:51:17] <Es0teric> :|
[19:51:21] <dmnd> you're suggesting to detach the delegated event handler that closes the menu?
[19:51:25] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, no, it's not.
[19:51:28] <Es0teric> yeah it is
[19:51:43] <dmnd> that handler is useful for other instantations of the dropdown control I'm using
[19:51:57] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, are you actually going to argue with me when I'm trying to help you?
[19:52:36] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, I am not sure how .unbind() works but I imagine it will only detach for that particular event.
[19:53:04] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us -_ alright then i'll fiddle the whole code then
[19:53:16] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, that website is pastebin.com, not jsfiddle.net.
[19:53:22] <min|dvir|us> I can't test your code on pastebin.com.
[19:53:26] <Es0teric> i am doing it now
[19:53:27] <Es0teric> hold up
[19:53:36] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: you know what a delegated event handler is right? $.fn.delegate which has now become $.fn.on?
[19:53:58] <dmnd> there is a single handler on document.body that all instantations of this control share
[19:54:20] <dmnd> because the dropdowns need to be closed when someone clicks elsewhere on the screen
[19:54:59] <dmnd> $.fn.live was another name for this thing - I may not be being clear because the named has changed so much over different versions of jquery
[19:55:19] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, why are you using a delegated event handler for body?
[19:55:36] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, also, if you use document, that is automatically the whole viewport.
[19:56:27] <dmnd> $('html').on('click.dropdown.data-api', clearMenus) is the exact call - sorry, it's on the html element not the body element
[19:56:53] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, so these are dynamically generated elements, then.
[19:57:01] <dmnd> also, it's not delegated - oops :)
[19:57:32] <dmnd> yes, and this handler is a global handler that clears all menus when the user clicks elsewhere
[19:57:41] <min|dvir|us> You've gone over that before.
[19:57:42] <dmnd> which seems fine to me
[19:57:54] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us -> http://jsfiddle.net/PvPAJ/
[19:57:55] <Es0teric> there you go
[19:57:58] <Es0teric> nothing populaes
[19:58:01] <Es0teric> *populates
[19:58:14] <min|dvir|us> I don't want your ENTIRE code.
[19:58:16] <min|dvir|us> A minimal example.
[19:58:33] <Es0teric> well i cant get a minimal example
[19:58:45] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, then give me a minimal test case. What should happen? What does happen?
[19:58:56] <Es0teric> its supposed to populate the list with album covers from lastfm
[19:59:05] <min|dvir|us> Also, this code doesn't work at all, because it doesn't include jQuery.
[19:59:26] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us http://jsfiddle.net/PvPAJ/2/
[19:59:27] <Es0teric> there you go
[19:59:29] <Es0teric> jquery included
[19:59:41] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, SyntaxError.
[19:59:45] <min|dvir|us> Stop it.
[19:59:56] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I'm not going to debug your spew of shit.
[20:00:04] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, you're going to have work to get help.
[20:00:26] <min|dvir|us> *have to work
[20:01:05] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us how is there even a syntax error
[20:01:11] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, you tell me.
[20:01:33] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: so, do you still think putting a property on the event object is bad here?
[20:01:37] <tw2113> TypeError: $(".music li").tipsy is not a function Line 136
[20:01:46] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, I would avoid it, but obviously that's not what you want to hear.
[20:02:06] <min|dvir|us> I'm getting fiddle.jshell.net:135Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string.
[20:02:32] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: I'm willing to be persuaded there is a better way to do it
[20:02:39] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, don't do what you're not sure of.
[20:03:00] <min|dvir|us> That is the only reason I would say you shouldn't do what you're doing.
[20:03:09] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: that's why I'm here trying to understand why jquery seems to give you a new event wrapper for each handler
[20:03:22] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, I'm afraid I can't help with that.
[20:04:12] <dmnd> min|dvir|us: thanks for listening
[20:04:51] <min|dvir|us> dmnd, I don't think you'll ever be sure of what changing the event object does. Don't do it.
[20:04:53] <Dr-Bombay> dmnd: it wraps the browser events to provide DOM3 event functionality
[20:04:56] <min|dvir|us> It's magic.
[20:05:01] <min|dvir|us> Don't do magic.
[20:05:12] <Es0teric> its saying the setTimeout has a token error
[20:05:14] <Es0teric> which is bs
[20:05:15] <Dr-Bombay> globals are not magic. They're quite well-behaved
[20:05:31] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, he's assigning a value to the event object and having it bubble.
[20:05:35] <Dr-Bombay> and it is foolish to pretend they don't exist
[20:05:47] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay, god, enough with you already.
[20:05:51] <Dr-Bombay> mind: yes we went over that already
[20:06:04] <Dr-Bombay> mindvirus: put me on ignore if it suits your fancy
[20:08:30] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us -> http://jsfiddle.net/PvPAJ/6/ there you go... no errors
[20:08:51] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us so its supposed to populate the album covers from lastfm
[20:09:00] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[20:09:11] <Es0teric> where do you get that?
[20:09:21] * tw2113 just got it by trying to use the fiddle
[20:09:24] <min|dvir|us> After submitting a last.fm username, and an empty string.
[20:09:57] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, you're wasting everyone's time.
[20:10:03] <Dr-Bombay> look who's talking
[20:10:22] <Es0teric> you wanted a fiddle, i gave you a fiddle, min|dvir|us dont be an ass
[20:10:23] <Chopps> hey guys, i need urgent help, http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/G8aWJ/ please check this fiddle on ie8 or ie9 and load the console, can anyone tell me why $.datepicker.formatDate doesnt work? it works well on chrome and firefox though, please help
[20:10:31] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, fine, someone else will help you. :)
[20:10:35] <Es0teric> and tw2113 what do you mean?
[20:11:18] <min|dvir|us> Apologize and I'll help again, assuming you've actually tested your fiddle.
[20:11:18] <tw2113> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3534225/Screenshot.png
[20:11:56] <Es0teric> tw2113 it only works like that because min|dvir|us suggested i wrap the #container ul
[20:12:03] <Es0teric> with multiple appends
[20:12:04] <Es0teric> so i did
[20:12:07] <Es0teric> now that shit dont work
[20:12:32] <Es0teric> i was fine before, but i had a... the hell is it called.. parsing? formatting?
[20:12:33] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, so you know, that's not true.
[20:12:51] <min|dvir|us> It says that because it's actually POSTing to JSfiddle.net.
[20:12:55] <min|dvir|us> But by all means, blame someone else.
[20:13:35] <Es0teric> how does that even make any sense?
[20:13:40] <Es0teric> i dont even have an action on the form
[20:13:49] <Es0teric> and my getJSON is OBVIOUSLY pointing to lastfm
[20:13:55] <tw2113> and when there's no action on a form, it posts to itself
[20:14:00] <min|dvir|us> OBVIOUSLY.
[20:14:04] <min|dvir|us> God, what a douchebag.
[20:14:23] <min|dvir|us> Man, IRC is full of ingrates today.
[20:15:25] <Es0teric> -_-
[20:17:11] <tw2113> quick question about if the ID on the text input should be usrname or username
[20:17:59] <Es0teric> tw2113 yeah that was a typo on my end
[20:18:12] <tw2113> min|dvir|us i will give Es0teric for at least trying new things and trying to learn this stuff. better than going to reddit and asking how to be a webdev
[20:18:23] <Es0teric> LOLLLL
[20:18:28] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, don't give him credit for biting the hand that feeds.
[20:18:41] <tw2113> min|dvir|us i've dealt with him online more than you have :)
[20:18:53] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, you're positively reinforcing his puppy-like behavior.
[20:18:54] <Es0teric> you arent giving me a paycheck, so you arent the hand that feeds me, min|dvir|us
[20:19:07] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, congratulations, you are a genius.
[20:19:15] <tw2113> i'm waiting to hear back from woothemes regarding getting paid to help people
[20:19:20] <Es0teric> you're more like.. the hand that assists
[20:19:27] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, so let's consider.
[20:19:29] <min|dvir|us> If I paid you money.
[20:19:32] <min|dvir|us> Would I be feeding you?
[20:19:36] <Es0teric> notice "ass" is in that
[20:19:43] <tw2113> beer moneh!
[20:20:06] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, look, you don't know anything.
[20:20:08] <min|dvir|us> :)
[20:20:14] <Es0teric> whatever man
[20:20:21] <tw2113> which is why he's always asking questions to try and learn
[20:20:32] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, let's discuss this for a second.
[20:20:36] <Es0teric> yeah, tw2113
[20:20:59] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, if he wanted to learn, would he be treating the one who can give him answers poorly?
[20:21:11] <min|dvir|us> No, to him it is important to feel important.
[20:21:13] <Es0teric> dude, you're the one being a douche, min|dvir|us
[20:21:23] <tw2113> you're both kind of douchenizzles to each other
[20:21:24] <Es0teric> you wanted a fiddle, i gave you a fiddle then you called my code shit
[20:21:35] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, you see, I can be a douche to you if I want, because I'm not the one that needs help.
[20:21:45] <Es0teric> so you admit that you're being a douche
[20:21:47] <Es0teric> caught you
[20:22:03] <tw2113> 0 points awarded
[20:22:03] <Es0teric> BRAVO
[20:22:11] <min|dvir|us> First of all, I wasn't; second of all, I'm not going to get caught up in some retarded argument with an 11-year old.
[20:22:34] <min|dvir|us> tw2113, as I was saying, don't give him positive reinforcement for unacceptable behavior.
[20:22:40] <min|dvir|us> If he treats your poorly, ignore him.
[20:22:42] <min|dvir|us> *you
[20:22:50] <Es0teric> tw2113 has known me for awhile now...
[20:22:56] <Es0teric> now that i think about it
[20:23:02] <tw2113> as if i'll listen
[20:23:23] <Es0teric> on an unrelated note, i cant believe people actually go on reddit to ask how to be a webdev
[20:23:42] <databack> how can i be a webdev?
[20:24:52] <tw2113> my other favorite question involves "how do i get better?"
[20:25:21] <databack> I think that is a good question to ask, honestly
[20:25:36] <tw2113> my head defaults to "practice"
[20:25:48] <tw2113> at least when asked as an open question
[20:25:56] <tw2113> if they asked for specifics, i'd be more forgiving
[20:26:27] <databack> I guess you have a point
[20:26:45] <Es0teric> lol
[20:26:46] <Es0teric> wow
[20:26:48] <tw2113> "new to php, how do I get betterz???"
[20:26:48] <trevorcaesar> Hi All... I am working on a client prototype and it's going well. Just have one thing that is stumping me. I have a container that has a few children divs. The menu on the left has a scrollLeft function that is triggered when clicking on a <li>. It works just fine and dandy but I need the elements to scrollLeft only up to the right side of the menu. Currently it scrolls all the way to the left of the browser window. Here is the 
[20:26:48] <trevorcaesar> url: http://www.thepixelflow.com/clients/benu/index_dev.html and here is a pastebin of the function: http://pastebin.com/CeWDpuE3
[20:27:18] <Es0teric> php is cool but... python looks more promising
[20:27:20] <trevorcaesar> Can anyone tell me how to adapt this function to make the scrolling stop at the right side of the menu instead of the far left of the browser window?
[20:27:42] <min|dvir|us> trevorcaesar, you're going to have to do math.
[20:27:56] <databack> Learn .NET or Java if  you want to go into web
[20:28:06] <databack> that's where the jobs are
[20:28:07] <trevorcaesar> just don't know where to place the +200 or -200
[20:28:13] <trevorcaesar> haha - nice nick, right :P
[20:28:20] <Es0teric> .net... ew
[20:28:20] <trevorcaesar> here goes anonymity. :P
[20:28:27] <min|dvir|us> databack, my past two jobs have been in Python.
[20:28:30] <Es0teric> ewwwww @ .net
[20:28:36] <Es0teric> id rather learn ruby
[20:28:41] <databack> Ruby, jesus
[20:28:53] <databack> MVC3 makes Rails seem like a rickety machine
[20:29:03] <databack> I like Python, I do
[20:29:16] <vl1234> hi hi GM
[20:29:20] <databack> I actually went to a Microsoft Academy to learn the .NET Framework, so I am biased though
[20:29:58] <Es0teric> ewww microsoft
[20:30:03] <min|dvir|us> databack, Node.js is what the web will be using in 5 years.
[20:30:05] <Es0teric> linux ftw
[20:30:17] <Es0teric> nodejs sucks
[20:30:29] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, your opinion is important.
[20:30:30] <databack> There is a popular JavaScript framework every 6 months
[20:30:41] <databack> I thought Backbone was the future?
[20:30:45] <Es0teric> thats like saying reactphp will pick up too... which has more of a chance of picking up
[20:30:49] <min|dvir|us> They solve different problems...
[20:30:56] <vl1234> i have var a = [   {'a':'1','b':'2'}, {'c':'3', 'd' : '4' } ]      and i dont know how to delete a[0] object..........
[20:30:59] <min|dvir|us> Backbone is the shit, and works both server- and client-side.
[20:31:03] <min|dvir|us> vl1234, .unshift().
[20:31:06] <Es0teric> reactphp > nodejs
[20:31:11] <vl1234> if any idea let me know froends
[20:31:25] <databack> min, I really dont know much about Node.js...What is the gist?
[20:31:26] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, if you like PHP, you don't know any other languages.
[20:31:40] <langui> I don't know about Node.js.  Certainly "not apache" seems to be the trend, though.
[20:31:42] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us your input is very important, thanks
[20:31:46] <hye> hi I have a global variable, and a .each function, how do I modify the global variable from inside the .each function?
[20:31:50] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, it's true though. :)
[20:31:59] <databack> The trend in web is SPA apps
[20:32:05] <Es0teric> just because i perfer reactphp over nodejs?
[20:32:10] <min|dvir|us> databack, it's beautiful. Node.js is async from the start, meaning that nothing blocks.
[20:32:17] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, yes. Anyone who prefers PHP doesn't know any other language.
[20:32:26] <Es0teric> dude, do you even know what reactphp is, min|dvir|us ?
[20:32:52] * tw2113 wanders away from hurricane blunderfork
[20:32:54] <vl1234> @min|dvir|us   a[0].unshift() means ill delete the second object
[20:33:01] <Es0teric> lol tw2113
[20:33:01] <min|dvir|us> vl1234, no, a.unshift().
[20:33:09] <databack> So it's faster?
[20:33:18] <databack> What about AJAX calls
[20:33:20] <min|dvir|us> databack, yes, non-blocking is much faster.
[20:33:26] <min|dvir|us> databack, AJAX calls are async too, just like in client-side JS.
[20:33:32] <databack> right
[20:33:33] <Es0teric> databack reactphp does the same thing nodejs does... its just in php
[20:33:41] <vl1234> @min|dvir|us   hey i want to delete the a[1] means?
[20:34:04] <databack> So what's the advantage of using node.js over a jQuery AJAX call
[20:34:06] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, I'm so right.
[20:34:20] <databack> PHP looks like puke though
[20:34:30] <min|dvir|us> databack, Node.js is like Python.
[20:34:42] <databack> interesting
[20:34:46] <langui> vl1234 a.splice(1,1);
[20:34:51] <langui> http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Mastering_Javascript_Arrays#quickIDX26
[20:35:13] <hi8is> looking for help with a function. currently it makes the div scroll all the way left. how can i make it scroll all the way left +400px? http://pastebin.com/CeWDpuE3
[20:35:21] <Es0teric> i saw an article on why nodejs sucks..
[20:35:24] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, go ahead, what other languages do you know?
[20:35:26] <Es0teric> i cant remember where it was from though
[20:35:30] <min|dvir|us> Just PHP right?
[20:35:54] <min|dvir|us> It's OK. You're 12. You have time to learn.
[20:35:56] <Es0teric> no, i know some python
[20:36:09] <databack> What I really need is a JavaScript that works in tandem with MVC
[20:36:23] <min|dvir|us> databack, Backbone.js does the M part of that.
[20:36:24] <databack> That is where the future is for the time being, as far as my work is concerned
[20:36:32] <min|dvir|us> databack, Express, a Node.js framework, does the VC part of that.
[20:36:36] <Es0teric> awww, look at min|dvir|us attempts to troll... thats cute
[20:36:41] <databack> Backbone is shipping with MVC4 apparently
[20:36:55] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, what other languages again?
[20:37:10] <min|dvir|us> What do you know about Python?
[20:37:17] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us you dont have to try so hard
[20:37:25] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, oh, it's that obvious? :)
[20:37:31] <databack> So then node.js handles calls to data?
[20:37:37] <min|dvir|us> databack, Node.js is a JS runtime.
[20:37:39] <databack> from the client?
[20:37:46] <min|dvir|us> databack, Node.js is the server.
[20:37:51] <databack> Hmm, interesting
[20:38:02] <min|dvir|us> databack, that's the whole point. It's server-side JS.
[20:38:11] <Es0teric> databack would you really use.. something serverside thats built out of javascript?
[20:38:11] <vl1234> @min|dvir|us   its not working
[20:38:12] <min|dvir|us> And it's really nice.
[20:38:37] <vl1234> @langui its not workin
[20:38:40] <databack> I dont know why I'd use JavaScript to handle server side code
[20:38:49] <min|dvir|us> vl1234, what does 'working' mean?
[20:38:56] <databack> But......With Windows 8 I think that'd be useful
[20:38:57] <langui> vl1234 What's it doing?
[20:39:05] <langui> vl1234 pastie the context
[20:39:11] <min|dvir|us> databack, personally I think Node.js is the shit.
[20:39:12] <vl1234> ushift() is not working
[20:39:25] <databack> What is the advantage over C#?
[20:39:32] <vl1234> @langui nothing doin
[20:39:37] <databack> I like my strongly typed objects
[20:39:40] <min|dvir|us> databack, much greater code expressivity, asynchrony, open-sourceness.
[20:39:40] <vl1234> @langui nothing doing
[20:39:55] <min|dvir|us> databack, I'm not going to convince you to use Node.js. If you don't, you will in 5 years. :)
[20:40:04] <databack> lol, we'll see
[20:40:09] <databack> But they told me the same thing about Silverlight
[20:40:13] <min|dvir|us> databack, nobody said that.
[20:40:15] <langui> vl1234 "nothin doin" as in you're not going to pastie the context?
[20:40:18] <databack> oh yes they did
[20:40:28] <min|dvir|us> You must have some deep MS blood.
[20:40:43] <databack> I think the .NET Framework is awesome. absolutely
[20:40:45] <min|dvir|us> Nobody in my programming circles has ever respected anything that came out of MS, save for input devices.
[20:41:02] <databack> That's because you are cornfed the open source mumbo jumbo
[20:41:04] <databack> I dont care who makes it
[20:41:10] <min|dvir|us> Corn-fed? We make it.
[20:41:26] <Es0teric> :|
[20:41:28] <databack> That's irrelevant to me
[20:41:33] <databack> LINQ is fucking beautiful
[20:41:38] <min|dvir|us> databack, you stated it as a reason, and it's wrong.
[20:41:46] <min|dvir|us> databack, OK, then enjoy your LINQ. Like I said, I'm not going to argue with you.
[20:41:53] <min|dvir|us> If you want reasons why I like Node.js, I'll be happy to share.
[20:41:56] <vl1234> am declare the var a = [ {'a':'1','b':'2'}, {'c':'3', 'd' : '4' } ]  and am used the code for a.slice(1,1) what u told me for deleting 2nd object...........but its not workin
[20:42:01] <min|dvir|us> I don't care if you like your MS solution or not, frankly.
[20:42:06] <min|dvir|us> I'm never using it. :)
[20:42:06] <vl1234> u debug in firefox
[20:42:12] <databack> hey, im open minded. you are attacking me for being passionate about .NET
[20:42:19] <min|dvir|us> databack, I don't feel that way.
[20:42:21] <databack> But I am passionate about development,  period.
[20:42:24] <min|dvir|us> (I don't feel I'm attacking you.)
[20:43:10] <langui> vl1234 http://pastie.org/4163625 works for me
[20:43:12] <min|dvir|us> databack, anyway, I'll tell you right now that the consensus agrees that open-source is the way forward.
[20:43:13] <databack> So you admit that there are many bright minds, many brighter than you (no offense), who use and master .NET
[20:43:19] <databack> Oh please
[20:43:21] <databack> I dont buy that
[20:43:30] <databack> C# isnt going anywhere
[20:43:37] <hye> i just found the main pitfall of jquery
[20:43:39] <min|dvir|us> databack, that's not what I call open-source.
[20:43:41] <hye> it shouldnt be used for complex scenarios
[20:43:53] <hye> obfuscated debugging nightmare from hell
[20:44:09] <min|dvir|us> databack, I would tell you to get with the times, but I don't want you think I'm attacking you.
[20:44:26] <databack> lol, I think you absolutely believe that
[20:44:34] <databack> But I don't agree
[20:44:50] <min|dvir|us> Fair enough.
[20:45:24] <databack> What Im concerned with is my niche and where it's heading, and that's .NET Web Development and WebDev in general
[20:45:46] <min|dvir|us> I'd be concerned, too. (No offense.)
[20:45:50] <databack> And to me, that future is MVC/LINQ/jQuery...That is the now...Where that is going is to SPA/HTML5/CSS3
[20:46:16] <min|dvir|us> What is SPA?
[20:46:20] <databack> HTML5/CSS3 will rule for at least 10 years
[20:46:21] <hi8is> can someone please give me a hand for 5 minutes? if you can't help with this function in less than 5 minutes... or point me in the right direction - then i won't ask for anymore of your time.
[20:46:23] <databack> Single Page Applications
[20:46:43] <databack> And MVC/LINQ/jQuery compliment each other perfectly
[20:46:46] <databack> For SPA
[20:47:05] <min|dvir|us> databack, have you worked with non-MS solutions?
[20:47:29] <databack> Ive work with COBOL in the workplace, but the others, such as Python are my own work
[20:47:53] <min|dvir|us> What do you do with Python?
[20:48:08] <databack> Data manipulation mainly
[20:48:38] <min|dvir|us> databack, do you have an opinion?
[20:48:40] <vl1234> @langui hey sorry am using slice inthat splice
[20:48:48] <vl1234> @langui thankzzzz man
[20:49:24] <langui> vl1234 np
[20:49:39] <min|dvir|us> databack, from a business perspective, the biggest problem with using an MS solution is vendor lock-in, and lack of source.
[20:49:43] <min|dvir|us> In my opinion.
[20:49:48] <vl1234> @langui thankzzzz np means
[20:50:07] <databack> There are a lot of benefits though
[20:50:12] <min|dvir|us> MS makes some good software when they want to, and when I used it (.NET 2.0), it was good.
[20:50:22] <databack> .NET 4.0 has some cool stuff
[20:50:24] <min|dvir|us> But I will tell you: MS will never be ahead of the curve.
[20:50:31] <databack> And 4.5 is going async
[20:50:35] <min|dvir|us> Even at their peak, they're trailing.
[20:50:57] <min|dvir|us> Which works for enterprise, because they want tried and tested.
[20:51:02] <databack> exactly
[20:51:27] <min|dvir|us> For me, I'm content with a bunch of unit tests and the community.
[20:51:47] <databack> I like the .NET community a lot too though
[20:52:03] <min|dvir|us> Cool.
[20:52:08] <databack> I go to .NET meetups...Have met some of the popular devs.. It's a good community
[20:52:26] <databack> Plus MSDN prescriptions have good perks
[20:52:35] <databack> subscriptions too
[20:54:19] <databack> btw, im always worried..it could all change in a year
[20:54:20] <Es0teric> passing a object to .attr() in the $('img').attr() is not showing the images
[20:54:41] <min|dvir|us> databack, by the way, I think JS is a stunning language, because it's functional and very simple.
[20:54:55] <Es0teric> when the properties are src, width, height, alt
[20:55:08] <min|dvir|us> I think there's nothing wrong with using it on the server, especially when there's V8, which is a fantastic JIT.
[20:55:10] <databack> That's probably why you like node.js
[20:55:23] <min|dvir|us> databack, no, it's not.
[20:55:40] <min|dvir|us> I like Python and Clojure way better.
[20:55:52] <databack> Using JavaScript to make calls to a DB just feels wrong
[20:55:55] <min|dvir|us> But CoffeeScript, I think, is the most beautiful language.
[20:56:02] <min|dvir|us> databack, how do you know? You've never done it.
[20:56:08] <databack> lol you're righ
[20:56:09] <databack> t
[20:56:27] <min|dvir|us> conn.get('resource#1', function (data) { console.log(data); });
[20:56:36] <systemfault> Welcome to callback hell
[20:56:49] <min|dvir|us> That's why it's fast.
[20:56:50] <databack> good lord
[20:57:11] <langui> vl1234 np => "no problem"
[20:57:13] <min|dvir|us> I recommend you look at CoffeeScript, which makes callbacks look much cleaner.
[20:57:15] <databack> as opposed to dbContext.Where(x=> x.Id = 5).Single();
[20:57:30] <min|dvir|us> databack, yes, but also non-blocking and therefore more efficient.
[20:57:42] <Es0teric> [06.27.12 • 11:56PM] 《 systemfault 》 Welcome to callback hell <--- lmaoo
[20:57:48] <systemfault> Meh.. coffeescript is just a sugar coat.. it doesn't solve the callback hell
[20:57:59] <min|dvir|us> systemfault, what's wrong with callbacks again?
[20:58:16] <min|dvir|us> The only problem I see is that 'function' is 8 characters.
[20:58:17] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Nothing… until you need a few of them
[20:58:21] <Es0teric> coffeescript does look nice though..
[20:58:33] <systemfault> Then you get the dreaded callback triangle.
[20:58:44] <min|dvir|us> In my programming with Node.js, I've never had a problem with too many callbacks.
[20:58:44] <systemfault> promises help….
[20:58:47] <mdunham918_> hey guys I'm working on an application that runs hospitals all over the country and I have an issue with .show(100) and .hide(100) causing a jump. Does anyone have a second to look at what I've done?
[20:58:53] <min|dvir|us> And I can't imagine such a problem.
[20:59:18] <databack> I just Googled Clojure to read more about it and their website timed out
[20:59:36] <min|dvir|us> databack, everyone should know a Lisp.
[20:59:54] <min|dvir|us> databack, does C# have first-class functions?
[21:00:03] <mdunham918_> http://local.matthewdunham.com:1337/prognosis/filemanager/?user_id=1 this is the url to my application and the piece thats having problems is in the footer bar. When you click "You're Here" it supposed to smoothly slide open and then when you close it, its supposed to smoothly close but it jumps.
[21:00:08] <databack> Functional programming scares me
[21:00:19] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Yeah.. lambdas
[21:00:21] <min|dvir|us> databack, we'll never get along. :)
[21:00:29] <databack> F# does
[21:00:35] <databack> Yea, lamdas, that's true
[21:00:37] <mdunham918_> I just really want to know what is causing this problem so i can avoid it later
[21:00:50] <min|dvir|us> I can't stand the thought of using a language without higher-order functions.
[21:01:12] <systemfault> Meh...
[21:01:33] <databack> Sometimes, I just want to change the text of a label
[21:01:34] <systemfault> I mean.. you can somewhat emulate them even in C with function pointers.
[21:01:44] <systemfault> In java with anonymous classes..
[21:01:47] <min|dvir|us> systemfault, C definitely has higher-order functions.
[21:02:01] <min|dvir|us> systemfault, (using pointers).
[21:02:03] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Not really.. they're just pointers to function.
[21:02:10] <databack> delegates
[21:02:20] <min|dvir|us> systemfault, if you can refer to a function without calling it, I'd say that's higher-order.
[21:02:31] <mdunham918_> i would really appreciate any help and you could even end up helping me save lives :)
[21:03:03] <databack> that's why I like coming to these chatrooms though..i wouldn't even be exposed to some framework like Clojure otherwise
[21:03:03] <langui> I don't think you can make anonymous functions in straight C
[21:03:07] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: You cannot create and return a function in C
[21:03:22] <min|dvir|us> This is true, there are no function expressions in C.
[21:03:27] <langui> Objective-C has "blocks" which I think are something like that
[21:03:44] <systemfault> langui: It's an Apple extension, yeah
[21:04:04] <min|dvir|us> databack, jeez, man.
[21:04:19] <min|dvir|us> I really don't mean to offend you, but your usual source of information is probably more than a little biased.
[21:04:33] <databack> Your is just as biased ;)
[21:04:50] <mdunham918_> awww so no takers on my little issue?
[21:05:04] <hi8is> looking for help with a function. currently it makes the div scroll all the way left. how can i make it scroll all the way left +400px? http://pastebin.com/CeWDpuE3
[21:05:05] <min|dvir|us> databack, I know and have used MS solutions before.
[21:05:13] <min|dvir|us> In fact, I started with J++. Then J#.
[21:05:23] <systemfault> wtf...
[21:05:32] <databack> The reality with me is this...Ive been developing for about 3 years...It's what I do....I am intent on mastering .NET
[21:05:32] <systemfault> No wonder why you're weird.
[21:05:55] <langui> mdunham918_: what exactly is the problem with that page?
[21:05:57] <databack> So that's what I study....I need to master that before I work on a hobby framework like Clojure
[21:05:58] <langui> it looks fine to me
[21:06:07] <langui> except for the horrible situations in the photos
[21:06:14] <mdunham918_> langui: when you click "You're Here" and then close it you see the bar jumps
[21:06:15] <systemfault> databack: It's a language… not a framework
[21:06:16] <databack> I could derail now and focus all on Python, but then id be going backwards
[21:06:23] <systemfault> (Just saying)
[21:06:25] <min|dvir|us> databack, no, forwards.
[21:06:41] <databack> lol, no backwards
[21:06:44] <min|dvir|us> databack, Python is STILL gaining widespread adoption, even though it's one of the most popular languages already.
[21:06:46] <mdunham918_> langui: its not a smooth i wanted it to slide out but the jump was so bad with sliding i just went with .show(100) and .hide(100) but i still get jumps on it
[21:06:50] <systemfault> Python on Windows… yeah, it's backward :P
[21:06:52] <mdunham918_> is it my CSS or what?
[21:07:02] <databack> Python is more popular in classrooms than workplaces
[21:07:09] <mdunham918_> its s simple .click() { $crums.show(100) and then $crums.hide(100); }
[21:07:20] <systemfault> True… Python is king in the academic sector.
[21:07:26] <min|dvir|us> No, Java is.
[21:07:38] <databack> And C# is superior to Java
[21:07:42] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Java is king in enterprise.
[21:07:44] <databack> troof
[21:07:51] <systemfault> databack: The language itself, yes.
[21:07:57] <min|dvir|us> ...
[21:08:04] <systemfault> databack: The whole ecosystem + tooling, no
[21:08:06] <Dr-Bombay> legacy is king in enterprise
[21:08:15] <min|dvir|us> Dr-Bombay is right.
[21:08:19] <Dr-Bombay> java is just an upstart
[21:08:20] <mdunham918_> this is no joke it really is going to run hospitals all over the USA i know this is a minor issue but i would love to know why its doing it as to avoid problems down the line
[21:08:25] <databack> Tooling? What does Java have to match Visual Studio?
[21:08:35] <systemfault> databack: Things like maven..
[21:08:37] <databack> Nada
[21:08:37] <min|dvir|us> databack, Visual Studio is arguably the best IDE ever made.
[21:08:47] <databack> I agree...almost too good, lol
[21:08:49] <Dr-Bombay> I am always right
[21:08:56] <systemfault> I agree, visual studio is the best IDE :)
[21:09:04] <mdunham918_> min|dvir|us: i agree vs ide rules
[21:09:15] <systemfault> (I'm saying it even though I don't use Windows….)
[21:09:19] <mdunham918_> for microsoft languages but for js, php html netbeans +++
[21:10:08] <min|dvir|us> databack, I'd rather use a simple editor with JS or Python any day, though.
[21:10:18] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: same :P
[21:10:18] <min|dvir|us> Also, what VCS do you use?
[21:10:26] <systemfault> git! :D
[21:10:30] <min|dvir|us> Don't say SourceSafe.
[21:10:36] <databack> Ive been using Aptana Studio for Python
[21:11:25] <databack> git
[21:11:29] <systemfault> I'm back to svn for a new project at work… damn I already miss git
[21:11:36] <min|dvir|us> databack, at least you've got one thing right. :P
[21:12:18] <databack> Im always right
[21:12:27] <systemfault> Except when you're not.
[21:13:25] <databack> yes....anyways...good chat...im going to bed
[21:14:06] <min|dvir|us> Been a while since I talked to someone who was so into MS solutions.

[21:22:25] <jworboys> Does anyone know of a way to remove an element from a jQuery object but not from the DOM?
[21:22:58] <LoneStar99> jworboys: what u trying to do?
[21:23:10] <min|dvir|us> ?.net > jworboys
[21:23:11] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, Couldn't find ".net > jworboys" in jQuery Docs.
[21:23:15] <min|dvir|us> ?.not > jworboys
[21:23:16] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, Couldn't find ".not > jworboys" in jQuery Docs.
[21:23:20] <min|dvir|us> ?.not | jworboys
[21:23:20] <bot-t> min|dvir|us, .not() - Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[21:23:47] <jworboys> .not may work, let me test it out
[21:24:32] <min|dvir|us> Who the hell invented bot-t?
[21:25:21] <jworboys> Lol, still not sure if it will work
[21:25:51] <fris> what would be the jquery equiv to using document.addEventListener('click' i tried using $("body").on("click", function(event){ but no go
[21:25:51] <jworboys> Basically I have a ul with nested ul's (navigation style)
[21:26:05] <min|dvir|us> fris, $(document).click().
[21:26:33] <fris> instead of ready?
[21:26:51] <jworboys> If I do a $("ul") I get the outer ul + the inner ul's. I then want to remove the inner ul's from the selected outer one.
[21:27:05] <min|dvir|us> $(document).ready() lets you register an event handler like .click(), but .ready()'s is for the DOMready event, when the DOM has been parsed.
[21:27:09] <mdunham918_> lame
[21:27:21] <min|dvir|us> Whereas the .click()'s is for a DOM element click.
[21:27:48] <fris> so this? $(document).on("click", function(event){
[21:28:18] <jworboys> The part I can't figure out is how to modify a jQuery object without affecting the DOM.
[21:28:26] <min|dvir|us> fris, jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {               $(document).click(function (evt) { console.log('herp clicked'); });        });
[21:28:31] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, just like I told you.
[21:33:24] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, what are you trying to modify about it?
[21:33:43] <min|dvir|us> You can use .detach() if you don't want changes to be visible.
[21:35:18] <jworboys> .detach still removes the element, it just leaves the events etc. I'm preparing an example for you
[21:35:37] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, .detach doesn't remove the element.
[21:35:48] <min|dvir|us> It's just removed from any (grand)children of the document node.
[21:36:09] <min|dvir|us> If you want to fucking obliterate the element, use .remove().
[21:36:47] <jworboys> hence removed from the DOM.
[21:36:56] <min|dvir|us> You can do $('.selector').not('#dont-want-this-one');
[21:36:56] <Es0teric> -_-
[21:37:12] <culh> jesus
[21:37:28] <min|dvir|us> Meaning select all elements with class .selector but not including those with ID #dont-want-this-one.
[21:38:29] <culh> does that method get better performance than looping through the elements with each() ?
[21:38:30] <Es0teric> WTF
[21:38:34] <Es0teric> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
[21:38:46] <min|dvir|us> Same as $('.selector:not(#dont-want-this-one)');
[21:39:03] <min|dvir|us> culh, to whom was that question addressed?
[21:39:16] <culh> who else is talking
[21:39:25] <Es0teric> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
[21:39:31] <Es0teric> i was missing <a> and <img>
[21:39:49] <Es0teric> REALLY? $('<a>') && $("<img>") <-- WORK?
[21:39:52] <culh> min|dvir|us: ok, let's be clear: you.
[21:40:19] <min|dvir|us> culh, I have no idea. Benchmark them.
[21:40:23] <culh> Es0teric: should be $('a') and $('img')
[21:40:23] <min|dvir|us> Rather, profile them.
[21:40:29] <systemfault> As if it was important..
[21:40:33] <min|dvir|us> culh, depends on what he wants to do.
[21:40:46] <Es0teric> culh that didnt work.. i literally spent like... an hour
[21:40:50] <Es0teric> trying to figure this out
[21:40:59] <culh> min|dvir|us: I've material on jquery benchmark, but not specific to the not selector.
[21:41:02] <Es0teric> and i finally did <a> and <img />
[21:41:13] <Es0teric> it worked
[21:41:31] <culh> Es0teric: does it have to do with !doctype declarations?
[21:41:32] <Es0teric> i wonder why it works like that though...
[21:41:46] <Es0teric> culh i have a html5 doctype right now
[21:41:59] <culh> I'm guessing.
[21:42:53] <min|dvir|us> culh, I'd be willing to bet that it does.
[21:43:04] <min|dvir|us> .each() might do it an extra time.
[21:43:11] <culh> yep, it sounds like a doctype issue
[21:43:40] <min|dvir|us> culh, it wasn't a doctype issue.
[21:43:46] <min|dvir|us> He had 'a' instead of '<a>'.
[21:43:59] <min|dvir|us> If you want to make a new a tag, you use $('<a>').
[21:44:00] <jworboys> member:min|dvir|us: This is a simplified version of the scenario http://hastebin.com/fofenugogo.xml
[21:44:48] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, JSfiddle.
[21:44:57] <culh> min|dvir|us: right, I forget. I usually do the opposite way
[21:45:05] <Es0teric> min|dvir|us well i figured it out so ha
[21:45:12] <min|dvir|us> Es0teric, don't talk to me.
[21:45:27] <Es0teric> oh well, open chat, i can mention who i want
[21:45:38] <Es0teric> if you want to act like somethin is up your ass then whatever
[21:45:44] <culh> am i interrupting something?
[21:45:55] <min|dvir|us> culh, not at all! Any questions?
[21:46:40] <culh> lol ok. not yet, just trying to keep up
[21:47:02] <Es0teric> that setTimeout i put in the script earlier really helped out though...
[21:47:33] <culh> I'm supposed to be doing a ballon box like google's email textarea that shows the results on a list below the field.
[21:47:44] <culh> bbl

[21:52:45] <MysterOnyx> I have a <h3> and a <div> for a specific meal. In order to assign them to the same meal, I've given them both the same id because I don't know what else to do. Is there another way to make it so both the h3 and div assigned to say meal 1 are actually assigned to it?
[21:53:19] <acidjazz> is there a way to detect if a mouse is over an element or not
[21:53:26] <acidjazz> not hte action of a blur but lets say later on
[21:56:16] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, http://jsfiddle.net/3CdgU/1/
[21:56:59] <min|dvir|us> http://jsfiddle.net/3CdgU/2/ -- cleaner.
[21:57:26] <acidjazz> i want functionality to check if a mouse is currently over a div
[21:57:41] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, use event handlers and state.
[21:57:46] <acidjazz> no
[21:57:49] <acidjazz> not to track it
[21:57:52] <min|dvir|us> jworboys, http://jsfiddle.net/3CdgU/3/ -- better.
[21:58:22] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, listen. Use event handlers.
[21:59:17] <jworboys> min|dvir|us thanks, I'll have a play with it in actual code.
[21:59:22] <acidjazz> i found it
[21:59:23] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, there's also $(selector).is(':hover').
[21:59:30] <acidjazz> is(':blur')
[21:59:42] <acidjazz> so what again about event handlers? :)
[21:59:44] <min|dvir|us> :blur is different, meaning not having focus.
[21:59:49] <acidjazz> yes
[21:59:50] <acidjazz> i know
[22:00:04] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, yeah, yeah. :P
[22:01:00] <acidjazz> oh derp
[22:01:05] <acidjazz> blur = focus/blur
[22:01:09] <acidjazz> diff from hover
[22:01:23] <min|dvir|us> So what again about knowing?
[22:01:29] <acidjazz> yea yea lol
[22:01:44] <acidjazz> rad works
[22:02:05] <acidjazz> so its like i hover over a div
[22:02:07] <acidjazz> it expands
[22:02:11] <acidjazz> animated
[22:02:17] <acidjazz> if i blur the div during the animation
[22:02:25] <acidjazz> i dont want instantly trigger the blur animatino
[22:02:35] <acidjazz> cuz itll catch a constant loop of the cursor being in the expanded area
[22:02:41] <acidjazz> so now during animation handlers are off
[22:02:49] <acidjazz> then are turned on w/ a 2 second delay checking :hover
[22:02:52] <acidjazz> perfectooo
[22:03:08] <acidjazz> and its less violent
[22:03:21] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, you probably shouldn't be using a delay.
[22:03:42] <acidjazz> i like it
[22:03:47] <acidjazz> it doesnt instantly close
[22:03:51] <acidjazz> hangs out for a second
[22:03:53] <acidjazz> doing 1sc..
[22:04:36] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, you just put a band-aid on the real problem, I'm guess. You can still have a delay with a real solution.
[22:04:40] <min|dvir|us> *guessing
[22:04:47] <acidjazz> here min|dvir|us
[22:05:12] <acidjazz> http://pastebin.com/yb5e1hHw
[22:05:14] <acidjazz> seperated it for ya
[22:05:33] <min|dvir|us> Nope.
[22:05:38] <acidjazz> ending } was cut
[22:05:45] <acidjazz> you see what i mean though
[22:05:47] <min|dvir|us> Not unless I can see it in action.
[22:06:02] <acidjazz> i dont think i can pull this div/css out
[22:06:14] <acidjazz> its simple you got hover() and out()
[22:06:24] <acidjazz> bound to $('.search').hover(func, func);
[22:06:38] <acidjazz> if its animating neither will fire
[22:06:59] <min|dvir|us> acidjazz, I need interactive feedback.
[22:07:47] <acidjazz> well dont click that link then
[22:07:47] <min|dvir|us> I like your name.
[22:08:12] <min|dvir|us> I like Clifford Gilberto a lot.
[22:08:28] <raj> do I need to JSON.stringify when sending an array full of objects?
[22:08:36] <raj> actually an array full of arrays full of objects
[22:08:47] <min|dvir|us> raj, most likely yes. Sending over what?
[22:08:55] <raj> $.post()
[22:09:04] <min|dvir|us> raj, yes.
[22:09:23] <raj> k, thanks
[22:09:25] <min|dvir|us> Well, you need a serialization method. JSON.stringify happens to be a good choice.
[22:09:26] <newbiee> how can i find out which input box is active or has focus if two have same id
[22:09:29] <newbiee> is there any way?
[22:09:41] <MysterOnyx> they shouldn't have the same id, newbiee
[22:09:45] <min|dvir|us> newbiee, two elements should never have the same ID.
[22:09:47] <raj> newbiee, two elements shouldnever have the same id
[22:09:49] <MysterOnyx> lol
[22:09:50] <raj> whoa
[22:10:05] <systemfault> I guess that he knows now o_O
[22:10:36] <min|dvir|us> newbiee, you can see which input boxes are active by using $('input:focus').
[22:10:44] <coldhead> IDs must be unique, newbiee
[22:11:02] <newbiee> ok
[22:12:20] <min|dvir|us> newbiee, you can also use $(document.activeElement) (which is much faster), but that's not guaranteed to be an input.
[22:12:38] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: What is the browser support for that?
[22:13:11] <min|dvir|us> systemfault, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.activeElement#Browser_compatibility
[22:13:52] <systemfault> Ahhh wonderful
[22:14:02] <systemfault> Opera is always late...
[22:14:13] <systemfault> It's slowly becoming the new IE
[22:14:33] <min|dvir|us> I append 'mdn' to my Google searches regarding JS/HTML/CSS.
[22:15:30] <systemfault> Yeah.. or else, you get stupid w3schools results
[22:15:39] <min|dvir|us> God I hate those.
[22:15:53] <min|dvir|us> I'm so glad Google lets you block domains.
[22:19:17] <istvan> hello all - i'v been looking jScrollPane but I need a trigger when the scrolled-ness changes. ideas?
[22:21:06] <jworboys> min|dvir|us, I got it passing my unit tests with your help. Thanks.
[22:36:21] <ProLoser|Work> anyone around?
[22:36:57] <ProLoser|Work> due to a work emergency, i need to cancel my ticket, anyone know wehre i can go to do this?
[22:40:25] <raj> if I $.post('/somewhere', 'hello') ... it shows up like an associative array with an empty string value serverside
[22:40:47] <raj> wasn't there some `true` or `false` argument I could pass to $.post to change this?
[22:42:08] <Cork> raj: you can't send a string like that
[22:42:19] <Cork> it always has to be a key=value combination
[22:42:51] <raj> oh
[22:42:56] <raj> k
[22:42:59] <Cork> so $.post('/somewhere', 'hello=') or $.post('/somewhere', { 'hello': '' }) or $.post('/somewhere', { message: 'hello' })
[22:43:00] <raj> thanks Cork
[22:46:53] <langui> min|dvir|us: only if you have "personal results" turned on :(

[23:11:47] <Cork> focus?
[23:11:54] <Cork> select its content?
[23:12:10] <ndss56> Cork: like flash continuosly on and off
[23:12:26] <ndss56> Cork: to indicate there are unread/seen messages.
[23:16:59] <ndss56> Cork?
[23:17:18] <systemfault> ndss56: just use jquery.animate to animate the border/background/whatever.

[23:27:56] <ndss56> Cork: want it to flicker to indicate unread messages.
[23:28:17] <istvan> ok ok, more precicely: when the user scrolls I need to trigger a function.
[23:28:26] <coldhead> ?scroll
[23:28:26] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/

[23:29:57] <istvan> coldhead: I was under the impression that the jscrollpane short-circuited the scroll
[23:31:11] <ndss56> Cork: .animate({ opacity: 0 }, 300) .animate({ opacity: 1 }, 300)
[23:31:22] <ndss56> Cork: oops. http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/1/

[23:46:42] <vl1234> i have 1 doubt
[23:47:05] <Cork> ?.stop @ ndss56
[23:47:05] <bot-t> ndss56, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[23:47:51] <vl1234> am disable the input by using the $('selectionid').attr("enabled","enabled") but i dont know how to enable the those fields
[23:48:08] <vl1234> if any one have idea about this let me help
[23:48:18] <blackspotwiggins> ?removeattr @ vl1234
[23:48:18] <bot-t> vl1234, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[23:49:02] <ndss56> Cork: No stop seen. see http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/8/
[23:49:03] <blackspotwiggins> or just .disabled = false on the dom iirc
[23:49:55] <systemfault> jquery has .prop
[23:50:16] <vl1234> @bot-t   sorry am using to disable the fields $('selectionid').attr("disabled","disabled")
[23:50:36] <vl1234> @bot-t   am tried remove attr but its not working
[23:51:13] <Cork> uhh jsfiddle is slooow -_-
[23:51:16] <Cork> (again)
[23:51:19] <vl1234> @bot-t   input box
[23:51:27] <Cork> ndss56: http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/9/
[23:53:48] <ndss56> Cork: why doesn't stop() just stop? why do you need to add .css?
[23:53:59] <Cork> ndss56: it does stop
[23:54:19] <Cork> it stopps at the state it currently is in
[23:54:28] <ndss56> Cork: then why add .css?
[23:54:30] <Cork> then you need to reset it to the state you want
[23:54:40] <ndss56> Cork: right.
[23:57:56] <ndss56> Cork: when i just do this i have to click it many times before it stops. $('input').click(function(e){$(this).stop();});
[23:57:57] <ndss56>  
[23:58:32] <Cork> you prob manage to try to click it when its transparent
[23:58:43] <Cork> and then it doesn't react to click
[23:59:06] <ndss56> Cork: u sure? i wait till i can see it before i click.
[23:59:54] <Cork> ah
