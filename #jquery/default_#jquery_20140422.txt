[00:00:35] <crashworks> jphase, the CSS isn't getting recalculated
[00:11:01] <t4nk553> Hi, hoping someone can help:  I have 10 images and only 5 are showing at any given time. I'm trying to randomly select one of the 5 that's showing, fade it out, and fade in a new image that's not already part of the 5 current images that are showing.  I have this so far but totally lost on what to do next: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/qq68m/
[00:32:48] <mockdot> hey, can anyone point me to a guide where i can learn how to execute a php function after updating a value on a textbox with jquery?
[00:34:00] <Yahkob> Anyone ever used timeago?
[00:34:25] <Cork> mockdot: you can‰t execut a php function
[00:34:53] <Cork> mockdot: you can make js do an ajax call to the server and have that call trigger the server
[00:35:03] <mockdot> right, i'd like to do something like that
[00:35:03] <Cork> can‰t == can't
[00:35:14] <mockdot> I can show you my work
[00:35:21] <mockdot> live app
[00:35:35] <Cork> mockdot: bind an input event on the field and do and $.ajax call from there
[00:35:44] <Cork> if you want for each keypress
[00:36:03] <mockdot> http://i.imgur.com/079VCyL.png
[00:36:07] <Cork> or use a change event if you want to trigger it on blur if it's changed
[00:36:35] <mockdot> only that those totals are calculated through php :P
[00:37:09] <Cork> mockdot: ya, so you need to make an ajax call after input and send the new html back
[00:37:15] <Cork> then replace the content on the right
[00:38:48] <mockdot> how about after modifying the textbox have it go to an url?
[00:38:59] <mockdot> I'm using laravel php framework so that would work perfectly
[00:39:27] <Cork> mockdot: you don't want to reload the entire page after each keypress
[00:39:44] <Cork> it makes it very slow, and you would lose what element the user had focused
[00:40:25] <mockdot> it's a point of sale system
[00:41:22] <mockdot> i should probably use laravel events i guess
[01:13:24] <t4nk553> Hi, hoping someone can help:  I have 10 images and only 5 are showing at any given time. I'm trying to randomly select one of the 5 that's showing, fade it out, and fade in a new image that's not already part of the 5 current images that are showing.  I have this so far but totally lost on what to do next: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/qq68m/
[02:00:02] <wa5ted> t4nk553: my jquery is rusty but let me see if i get this
[02:00:11] <wa5ted> you want to show 5 images besides one another correct?
[02:00:25] <wa5ted> 5 images that are randomly selected from a group of 10
[02:01:01] <wa5ted> and when you want to "fade out" an image does it matter where the new image goes?
[02:01:45] <wa5ted> also are your looking for *truly* random right?
[02:01:48] <wa5ted> t4nk553: ^
[02:02:56] <Cork> wa5ted: i think .not(old) is what he's looking for
[02:03:29] <wa5ted> ?
[02:04:10] <Cork> wa5ted: he's currently randomizing the full list of the images
[02:04:18] <Cork> so it can be the same image over and over again
[02:04:27] <wa5ted> ya
[02:04:35] <wa5ted> thats why i asked *truly* random or not
[02:05:39] <wa5ted> because whne people say random they tend to mean random but differnt elements from the ones presetn as opposed to truly random
[02:20:55] <Gorakhpuriya> How can we selected the div On Arrow key pressed and on hover?
[02:21:45] <Cork> "the div"?
[02:22:44] <Gorakhpuriya> yes, I have a structure of ul li and I want to selcted the li on Arrowkey pressed? Are you getting my point?
[02:23:28] <Polar_> :S
[02:23:30] <Cork> i'm getting that you want to select a div in relation to something when some keys are pressed
[02:23:40] <Cork> but no you're not specific enough
[02:24:10] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: I am new to IRC so kindly bear with me.
[02:24:34] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: simplest is if you make a small demo on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[02:24:48] <Cork> where you should the html structure you're working with
[02:24:59] <Cork> *where you show the
[02:25:14] <Cork> and possible the js you're using right now
[02:26:54] <Gorakhpuriya> I have ul li structure and I want to active/selected the li on ArrowKeypressed and also on hover.. And link is here http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/
[02:29:20] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Structure http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/2/
[02:30:19] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: simplest is prob to separate the styling out of the old function
[02:30:36] <Cork> and just set liSelected on hover and trigger that function
[02:30:45] <Cork> or you could prob solve it without that variable
[02:33:46] <Gorakhpuriya> For Information it is working on Left and right arrow key pressed, but how can get the top and bottom item for make it worak on top and bottom arrow keypressed?
[02:34:02] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Are you getting what I have a questions?
[02:34:43] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you can't solve that easily with the structure you have
[02:35:01] <Cork> cause you don't know how many elements can be on each row
[02:35:02] <Gorakhpuriya> Ok how can I do that?
[02:35:14] <Cork> set a fixed number of links pre row
[02:36:14] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: a bit of a clean up of the old code http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/3/
[02:36:23] <Cork> opps forgot to fix the second case
[02:37:21] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/4/
[02:38:51] <Cork> and one with hover http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/5/
[02:39:35] <Gorakhpuriya> I saw, Thanks for that.. but Also please let me know how can I select the li on 38 and 40 arrow key pressed..
[02:39:56] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: like i said you can't easily do that
[02:40:09] <Cork> you would have to loop the array, grab the position of the elements
[02:40:22] <Cork> find the ones that has the lowest .left value
[02:40:32] <Cork> and jump to the next/prev of those
[02:41:35] <Gorakhpuriya> Yes I have done with the Next and prev but not achieved which I want, so would you please give me a reference...
[02:42:36] <NimeshNeema> Gorakhpuriya:
[02:43:07] <Gorakhpuriya> Are you getting what I have questions? Please let me know
[02:48:41] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Are you with me?
[02:49:40] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: i've already told you
[02:49:49] <Cork> you need to calculate the position of the elements
[02:50:02] <Cork> filter out those that are on the same aprox position as your current element
[02:50:08] <Cork> and jump to that
[02:50:20] <Cork> the dom can't help you as it doesn't have the info
[02:51:55] <Gorakhpuriya> Ok so how can I get the position and jump on that according to the current select item, please let me know
[02:52:50] <abishek> i need an advice on a particular problem that I am working on. I have div on which the html is being set from a remote callback which I dont have control to. I need to invoke a javascript function after the remote callback has completed the html render on the div. how can i do that?
[02:53:04] <Koopz> sup
[02:53:35] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Do you have a examples from where I can get the help?
[02:54:40] <abishek> is there an event that I can hook to for an element to see if it has rendered completely?
[02:57:21] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: this isn't perfect in any way or form, but it is about as good as you can make it without making the structure static
[02:57:22] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/6/
[02:57:39] <Cork> abishek: no
[02:58:00] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Thanks a lot :)
[02:58:19] <Cork> abishek: but replaced elements that load external content like iframe, img or similar fires onload element for when they have loaded there content
[02:58:41] <Cork> abishek: all other elements render as soon as the browser gets the control back from js
[03:02:53] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: I have one question 38 and 40 arrow key pressed is not working on six link properly..
[03:04:06] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: it depends on how the browser renders the last link
[03:04:43] <Cork> as it is much further to the left then Thrid in chrome you fall outside of the fuzzy code in the js
[03:05:00] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you could try changing the 10 fuzzier to something like 20 or 30
[03:05:07] <Cork> but it might break other things
[03:08:45] <Gorakhpuriya> Ok Thanks a lot and let me try with the 20 and 30..
[03:09:40] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you could try doing something like this http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/7/
[03:10:56] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Ohh wow Awesome, Thanks a lot... Thanks :)
[03:11:06] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Really Helpful...
[03:11:32] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: or you could make each row be its own ul
[03:11:41] <Cork> and you would make all the code much simpler
[03:11:58] <Gorakhpuriya> How?
[03:14:37] <hxm> how to get the 2 first characters of a string?
[03:17:02] <CrowX-> is the following line valid?
[03:17:14] <hxm> ah substr
[03:17:14] <CrowX-> $(".gallery").on('click', isMaximized ? loadGallery);
[03:17:23] <CrowX-> or do I have to add :
[03:18:33] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: But if we make the own ul for reach row, so will be able to get the element selected on 38 and 40 arrow key pressed
[03:23:33] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/8/
[03:24:26] <Cork> CrowX-: you need :
[03:24:45] <Cork> CrowX-: but in that code your better of wrapping it in an if statement
[03:25:12] <abishek> Cork, for example. if $(someElement).html(someHtml) is called, is there and event that I can hook to `someElement` so that I call a function after the HTML on `someElement` is set?
[03:25:13] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Once again thanks a lot ...
[03:25:19] <Cork> CrowX-: and based on the content, your prob better of checking isMaximized inside the callback
[03:25:43] <Cork> abishek: no there isn't any events for dom modifications
[03:26:00] <Cork> abishek: there is a really new object you can use in some browsers for it though
[03:26:06] <Cork> called a mutationobserver
[03:26:11] <Cork> ?mdn mutationobserver
[03:26:12] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[03:26:30] <Cork> abishek: but notice that the browser support is quite limited
[03:26:32] <abishek> ok, I tried using DOMSubtreeModified and it works on Firefox and Chrome but not IE. I then tried propertychange on IE, that works for static elements, but not dynamic elements
[03:26:55] <Cork> abishek: ya, that old event is depricated, and as been removed from the spec
[03:27:06] <Cork> it had a lot of really bad performance problems
[03:27:13] <abishek> ok
[03:27:23] <abishek> i need it to work on IE8, what can i do?
[03:27:28] <Cork> no
[03:27:36] <Cork> ie8 has neither
[03:27:39] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/7Feh4/8/ ugh... i hate being deprecated... calling the submit-button in a dialog doesn't work
[03:27:43] <Cork> mutationobserver needs ie11
[03:27:59] <abishek> so, there is no possible way in ie8?
[03:28:00] <Cork> and the subtree event was never implmented in ie
[03:28:07] <Cork> abishek: not through the dom no
[03:28:17] <Cork> you can solve it with callbacks
[03:28:17] <abishek> k
[03:28:29] <abishek> meaning?
[03:28:32] <Cork> but that depends on the thing adding the html calling that function
[03:28:51] <Cork> abishek: you can have an "contentUpdated" function you call
[03:30:05] <abishek> well, i dont have control over what is setting the html on the div, which is why I wanted to hook it to an event that gets called after the html change happens on the DIV
[03:30:29] <Cork> abishek: is everything using .html()?
[03:31:42] <abishek> nope, i am working on a Microsoft technology (Sharepoint) that generates a menu. Microsoft has not provided a way to hide menu items that are not required and I am trying to remove the menu items after it has rendered
[03:32:10] <Cork> abishek: then you're basically screwed
[03:32:21] <abishek> its a pain to work on a Microsoft technology and over and above this, the company wants IE 8 support
[03:32:24] <Cork> only option left is a background timer checking the page over and over again...
[03:32:32] <Cork> abishek: ya, i know
[03:32:57] <abishek> k, you mean have setInterval and check if the element exists and hide it?
[03:33:06] <Cork> ya...
[03:33:10] <abishek> ok
[03:33:19] <Cork> but i really discourage going that route
[03:33:56] <abishek> ok, one more question which seems to fail in jquery. if my id involved `.` how to I select the item? for example <div id="Ribbon.Documents.Action" />
[03:34:13] <Cork> abishek: does ms add those?
[03:34:26] <abishek> yes, $('#Ribbon.Documents.Action') fails
[03:34:43] <Cork> abishek: dots in a selector means classes
[03:34:46] <abishek> they have their ribbon control on Sharepoint and the id's have dot
[03:34:50] <abishek> yes
[03:34:52] <Cork> so you have to escape those
[03:35:04] <abishek> how do i do that?
[03:35:04] <Cork> $('#Ribbon.Documents.Action') => $('#Ribbon\\.Documents\\.Action')
[03:35:09] <abishek> oh ok
[03:35:16] <abishek> never did that, good to know
[03:35:21] <Cork> \ for strings and \\ for the selector
[03:35:33] <abishek> ok, thnx for the detail. appreciate it
[03:35:48] <Cork> abishek: the idiot comming up with the idea of using . in id's should be...
[03:35:57] <Cork> made to code the page for it afterwards...
[03:36:40] <abishek> :)
[03:36:55] <abishek> the whole page is with id's containing `.`
[03:36:58] <abishek> every element.
[03:37:06] <Cork> basically [] . and # should never be used in ids
[03:37:38] <Cork> and i want to pound on the cms/framework creator every time i see it happens
[03:39:01] <abishek> its microsoft, you can never do anything about it
[03:39:06] <Cork> another one i irk over is the ones that has spaces in there ids
[03:39:07] <abishek> the best is to stop using it
[03:39:11] <Cork> ya
[03:39:21] <abishek> and never support IE
[03:39:31] <Cork> supporting newer ies is fine
[03:39:47] <Cork> as long as you write complient pages
[03:40:05] <Cork> but ya, you want to write for something other then ie before you start testing there
[03:40:49] <abishek> i have always had my projects delayed a lot when the client required IE support as well
[03:41:59] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to use hasClass function but I not get results. Any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/eVgpp/
[03:43:04] <JackBauer24> abailarri: Jesus Christ, close double quote and div tag
[03:43:15] <Cork> abailarri: validate your html
[03:46:41] <t4nk553> Wa5ted: hey, thanks. I'm trying to randomize it in a way where the current list of items don't change
[03:47:27] <t4nk553> in other words, you have 5 colors: red, blue, yellow, green, black. Any one of the colors can change (black for example), and it would change to maybe purple
[03:48:09] <t4nk553> and the order would then be red, blue, yellow, green, purple. The next time, one of the other colors might be selected and this this may be replaced by black. Not purple because it's already showing in list
[03:56:08] <Cork> t4nk553: you want to do list.not($('ul li'))
[03:56:20] <Cork> t4nk553: so that you don't random between the elements in the ul
[03:57:11] <BinaryKitten> Cork that would return nothing though
[03:57:27] <BinaryKitten> $('li').not($('ul li'))
[03:57:43] <Cork> BinaryKitten: i don't remember the code it was several hours ago
[03:57:53] <BinaryKitten> heh
[03:58:01] <Cork> but i think he had a list of lis outside the visible ul parent
[03:58:12] <Cork> and that was what i meant with the psudo code
[03:59:33] <BinaryKitten> Cork yep. i get you
[03:59:44] <BinaryKitten> this is why i hate giving psudocode here
[04:00:11] <BinaryKitten> so many people take it as 100% gospel instead of "here's the general idea"
[04:00:43] <Cork> BinaryKitten: ya, but when the conversation restarts after 5h i expect them to come back with "this didn't work"
[04:01:08] <BinaryKitten> :D
[04:01:19] * BinaryKitten hi-5s Cork and leaves be :)
[04:01:28] <Cork> ^^
[04:01:34] <decx> let the americans deal with it o/
[04:02:06] <abailarri> Cork, the code that I puted befores, not was. The correct is this: http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3140/. I tried some combinations but not works
[04:03:08] <abailarri> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3141/
[04:03:12] <Cork> you don't have any map-filter-type class
[04:03:54] <t4nk553> Cork: Thanks. What's the best way to fade out the image and switch it? I'm replacing the src="" right now but it looks choppy because I'm not fading it
[04:03:56] <abailarri> yes yes
[04:03:57] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3141/
[04:04:18] <Cork> abailarri: and now the class matches both elements
[04:04:42] <Cork> t4nk553: fadeOut is prob your best option
[04:04:56] <abailarri> Cork, waht do you mean?
[04:04:57] <Cork> t4nk553: and then when the animation is done you change the image, wait for load
[04:05:03] <Cork> and animate it back
[04:05:11] <decx> hasClass only runs on the first hit
[04:05:19] <Cork> abailarri: both elements match $(".map-filter-type")
[04:05:23] <BinaryKitten> img.fadeOut(function() { $(this).load(function() { $(this).fadeIn().off('load'); }).attr('src', 'yourimgsrc'); });
[04:05:28] <BinaryKitten> @ t4nk553
[04:06:12] <t4nk553> BinaryKitten: Ah, thanks. Let me try that
[04:06:15] <Cork> abailarri: i suspect this is what you want http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3143/
[04:06:47] <BinaryKitten> t4nk553 you'll need to adjust it slightly for img (unless that's the variable holding the img tag
[04:07:11] <Cork> woops
[04:07:27] <Cork> BinaryKitten, t4nk553: you can't do it like that
[04:07:36] <Cork> chrome will only fire .load once on an img element
[04:07:38] <BinaryKitten> Cork why not?
[04:07:46] <Cork> you need to replace the old element or the script will fail in chrome
[04:07:47] <BinaryKitten> oh yeah forgot about that
[04:08:03] <disgrntld> Hello, I've used a selector to add a keyup handler to a bunch of inputs, the handler should switch focus to the next input in the list when the length of it's value has reached maxlength. This works great except that it keeps going off the end (http://jsfiddle.net/We8CD/ ), any ideas?
[04:08:30] <disgrntld> also, I know that autoswitching is annoying and bad UI, but client wants it *shrug*
[04:09:55] <JackBauer24> disgrntld: The last input doesn't have maxlength attribute set, that's why the browser allows to input more characters, if that's what you mean
[04:10:39] <disgrntld> sorry, I wasn't clear enough, focus should not switch to #nottest when previous input's maxlength is reached
[04:10:59] <abailarri> Cork, really that I need is run this: http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3146/. The original code, but this not works
[04:11:00] <abailarri> http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3146/
[04:12:25] <JackBauer24> disgrntld: first of all, "id" attribute should always be unique. And to prevent focus change on the last element, you can just make a simple if statement, like if($(this).attr("id") != "test4") or whatever
[04:12:32] <Cork> abailarri: you don't really have anything relating those two elements
[04:12:47] <Cork> abailarri: add a class incommon with the two options
[04:13:00] <seutje> abailarri: whoa, revision 3146? and nobody has noticed the class name is spellec "ctivated"?
[04:13:06] <seutje> spelled*
[04:13:50] <disgrntld> oh yea, id is not the same in real code, I just slopped this together.. so just add an extra check? I figured there was someway to use next() since it only considers elements in selector
[04:13:56] <disgrntld> lemme try that JackBauer24
[04:14:43] <BinaryKitten> Cork would this? http://jsfiddle.net/Be6R8/
[04:15:15] <BinaryKitten> oops unset
[04:15:19] <BinaryKitten> too much php
[04:15:37] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3147/
[04:15:55] <JackBauer24> disgrntld: the if statement was the first thought, but with next() would be quicker like you said, altough you need to specify the selector, like .next("#test") in this jsfriddle example
[04:16:09] <JackBauer24> if no selector is specified then it just takes the next element in dom
[04:16:19] <disgrntld> ahhh, ok, lemme play with that
[04:16:29] <Cork> BinaryKitten: ya, i wouldn't bother removing the load listener though
[04:16:56] <seutje> Cork: psh, with ur fancy data links! http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3148/
[04:17:02] <Cork> JackBauer24: .next() is always the next element
[04:17:12] <disgrntld> say I store a selector that matches multiple elements (`var list = $('.something')`), how can I check if $(this) is a member?
[04:17:30] <Cork> JackBauer24: .next('selector') just means it will return [] if the selector doesn't match
[04:17:52] <seutje> BinaryKitten: does load fire if it's grabbed from cache? cause I believe it won't
[04:18:01] <Cork> disgrntld: .filter(this).legnth > 0
[04:18:06] <disgrntld> kk, thanks
[04:19:09] <disgrntld> http://jsfiddle.net/We8CD/1/
[04:19:14] <disgrntld> s'what I came up with, thanks guys
[04:19:18] <JackBauer24> Cork: yes, that's true, but on that jsfriddle example the outcome is the same either way
[04:22:46] <Cork> disgrntld: seriously, don't use regex on ids as selectors
[04:22:53] <Cork> disgrntld: if you need to group them use classes
[04:24:13] <disgrntld> well those ids are generated by my Django widget, but ok, I can add a class... just wondering, why is that so bad though? bad browser support for that attribute selector?
[04:25:39] <Cork> disgrntld: cause attribute selectors arn't cached
[04:25:42] <abailarri> Cork, is possible to work with some activatev class? http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3150/
[04:25:50] <Cork> disgrntld: the browser has to loop over all the elements matching input
[04:25:56] <disgrntld> ohhh, that makes sense
[04:26:04] <Cork> disgrntld: grab the attributes and check each attribute at a time
[04:26:08] <disgrntld> I hadn't considered that, thanks
[04:26:13] <Cork> disgrntld: while ids and classes is kept in a hash table
[04:26:16] <stanvass> disgrntld, because you're making jQuery enumerate literally all ids in your page, then run each of them against a tiny interpreter VM with your compiled regex.
[04:26:33] <t4nk553> Cork: The images that I'm trying to load in has the class "inactive" - any good way to randomly select one from the list with that class? I have var new_src = images.hasClass('inactive').eq(1); so far but doesn't work because it's not randomized
[04:26:37] <disgrntld> neato, learned something cool
[04:26:38] <Cork> abailarri: check the data-type attribute
[04:27:31] <Cork> var inactive = images.hasClass('inactive'); inactive.eq(Math.random() * inactive.length))
[04:27:42] <stanvass> Ids are good for two purposes - unique ids created by JS at runtime to point to a given node. And anchor links.
[04:28:06] <Cork> ya, and js is often better to use classes instead
[04:28:21] <Cork> that way you can write the code generically, for a feature instead of a specific element
[04:28:50] <Cork> meaning adding the class to the element gives the action, instead of having to copy the js
[04:30:18] <abailarri> Cork, I tried with this: http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3153/
[04:31:25] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Hi, I have a one question.. I want to change the text in a div according to the li selected through the arrowkeypressed
[04:31:32] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3154/
[04:32:00] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you want to add the content from the li or something else?
[04:32:21] <BinaryKitten> seutje no clue
[04:32:45] <BinaryKitten> but it seems to fade in again
[04:33:04] <BinaryKitten> t4nk553 http://jsfiddle.net/Be6R8/5/
[04:33:15] <BinaryKitten> Cork, seutje - updated version
[04:33:16] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/Be6R8/5/
[04:34:19] <seutje> BinaryKitten: sweet, guess that problem has been gotten rid of
[04:34:32] <seutje> now I can stop using imagesloaded
[04:34:54] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: I want to add the content from the li in a particular div.. Please see this http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/9/
[04:36:46] <t4nk553> BianryKitten: Thanks. I did use fadeOut earlier but decided not to because I had 5 images in a row that needed to maintain their order. Could you take a look at why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/qq68m/47/
[04:37:05] <Gorakhpuriya> Please see this link I have add the div in which text should be visible accroding to the li selected on hover or key pressed. The should be come form a (data-rel ) attribute... http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/10/
[04:37:43] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/11/
[04:38:02] <seutje> t4nk553: 'src' not 'src
[04:39:06] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Yeah, its working on hover properly but on Arrowkey pressed it is not working
[04:39:20] <Cork> opps forgot to test that
[04:39:22] <seutje> t4nk553: there's an extra parenthesis on var new_src = ...
[04:39:30] <seutje> t4nk553: n isn't defined anywhere
[04:40:04] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: works here...
[04:40:39] <fattest> Evertime user clicks on a li, it submits the form. I want, when you click on the li, to change the region of the main button (with the text, "search" written on it). I only want it to submit the form when user clicks on the search button. the lis are only used to change region. how can i achieve this codepad.viper-7.com/LtYt4V
[04:40:43] <fattest> http://codepad.viper-7.com/LtYt4V
[04:40:46] <seutje> t4nk553: hasClass() returns a boolean btw, not a collection
[04:40:48] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Ok let me check, Thanks a lot :)
[04:41:03] <t4nk553> setuje: fixed the other problems, but n is defined as the parameter isn't it? function random(n) {}
[04:41:55] <seutje> t4nk553: current = random(n);
[04:42:07] <seutje> gotta define it at some point
[04:43:39] <t4nk553> seutje: hmm I'm still stuck- I'm guessing on something silly :  http://jsfiddle.net/qq68m/51/
[04:45:32] <seutje> t4nk553: hasClass still returns a boolean
[04:45:41] <seutje> booleans don't have .eq() methods
[04:47:04] <seutje> also, ur using new_src as both a string and a collection
[04:50:28] <fattest> any help would be appreciated
[04:51:27] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: One more thing, I want to get the text from current selected a data-rel attr.. Is it possible
[04:52:19] <seutje> t4nk553: http://jsfiddle.net/qq68m/53/ and this is why you don't use a setInterval that initiates before the previous one has ended!
[04:52:32] <seutje> I suggest using a setTimeout called from within the animation callback
[04:52:37] <Cork> fattest: hard to tell what's going on from just the html, try running it through validation
[04:52:58] <fattest> Cork: ok
[04:53:04] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: sure, just replace .text() with .data('rel')
[04:54:17] <seutje> t4nk553: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/qq68m/54/
[04:54:38] <seutje> that way it'll wait till the animation is done before re-initializing the 400ms timeout
[04:54:45] <seutje> 300*
[04:56:02] <fattest> Cork: there is nothing wrong according to w3 validator? it's complaining that i have random spaces though, eg name="lan" > .
[04:56:17] <fattest> Cork: when you click on a li, it submits the form through the js
[04:56:26] <Cork> fattest: make a demo then
[04:56:42] <fattest> Cork: you mean in a fiddle?
[04:56:48] <Cork> yes
[04:56:56] <fattest> Cork: i already did
[04:57:00] <fattest> http://codepad.viper-7.com/LtYt4V
[04:57:15] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: But it is not working with keypressed
[04:57:23] <Cork> oh, it was me confusing the page...
[04:57:37] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  I have add $('.meta-description').text(current.data('rel'))
[04:57:37] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: what isn't working with keypress?
[04:57:51] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: it works as long as you don't have a link focused
[04:57:59] <Cork> (and it has been like that all along)
[04:59:00] <seutje> fattest: remove the $('#form').submit()?
[04:59:18] <fattest> seutje: but i need to submit the form when the user clicks the search button
[04:59:26] <seutje> that's like default behavior
[04:59:29] <seutje> fo free
[04:59:34] <fattest> seutje: the lis will determine the post name, region
[05:00:03] <seutje> so you swap the attributes when they click an LI?
[05:00:26] <seutje> would u rather look up the attributes when they click submit? either works
[05:00:28] <Cork> fattest: i suspect that is a bootstrap thing
[05:00:44] <seutje> but relying on default behavior usually nets you a couple benefits
[05:00:52] <Cork> looks like bootstrap fires click on a when you click the li
[05:01:22] <fattest> Cork: I don't think bootstrap has anything to do with it, its just a <a click
[05:01:30] <fattest> and currently, my form is being submitted
[05:01:37] <seutje> there's a click handler that explicitly calls the submit
[05:01:53] <Cork> seutje: ya, but it is bound on a, not li
[05:02:05] <seutje> oh
[05:02:08] <Cork> so something is doing $(this).find('a').click()
[05:02:59] <t4nk553> seutje: I see- thanks! still going over it and trying to understand it. Why do the images keep changing to the same one even though I replace the src? new_src.attr('src' , current_src);
[05:03:42] <seutje> t4nk553: it's pretty random for me, but logically they would end up all the same after a certain period of time
[05:03:46] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Ok.. Let me check and again Thanks a lot.. Bye have a nice time...:)
[05:06:21] <seutje> Cork: weird, when I remove the explicit submit call, it no longer submits on the LIs (as expected) and the return false makes me think that whatever handler there is on the LIs, gets ignored anyway
[05:06:46] <fattest> i can't seem to figure it out...
[05:07:58] <seutje> there's another click handler bound to the document though
[05:08:11] <Cork> ugg it is me reading my inspector colors wrong >_<
[05:08:21] <Cork> ya, there isn't any thing happening
[05:08:38] <Cork> the a tags take up all the space of the lis so you always click them
[05:09:08] <Cork> so ya the .submit() is the problem
[05:10:09] <fattest> indeed!
[05:10:11] <t4nk553> seutje: oh the selection is random, but I'm trying to make it so that there's never the same image repeated within the set
[05:10:59] <seutje> t4nk553: but the randomly selected image is chosen from the set
[05:11:42] <seutje> fattest: there's like 9 click handlers bound to the document, all minified coads q.q
[05:13:10] <seutje> fattest: http://codepad.viper-7.com/yrdqrb/55dev seems to work though
[05:13:34] <t4nk553> seutje: yeah the idea was that there's 10 different colors with only 5 showing. One of the 5 displayed would randomly switch with one of the images not displayed. At no point in time though should the same color be displayed more than once.
[05:14:20] <seutje> t4nk553: oh, ok guess u'll have to put a check in there and re-random if it fails
[05:16:53] <fattest> seutje: thank you so much
[05:24:13] <fattest> seutje: is it possible to change the text of kbd to the region when user changes the region
[05:29:04] <abailarri> Anyone can help me? I'm trying to add display none to the subfilters class that not have activated class in other div http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3159/

[05:37:15] <seutje> fattest: sure http://codepad.viper-7.com/igHTNV
[05:38:05] <abailarri> I not see anything
[05:38:13] <fattest> seutje: thank you so much
[05:50:14] <abailarri> Cork, I can't resolve the problem http://jsfiddle.net/gSAjV/3171/
[05:50:49] <Cork> abailarri: you can't solve it like that
[05:51:11] <Cork> abailarri: you need to loop the elements and grab the type value from each one and show the matching element
[05:57:53] <abailarri> Cork, when you say loop elements, do you refeer to use each function?
[05:57:59] <Cork> yes
[06:00:05] <abailarri> Cork, and how can I use this with my code?
[06:00:36] <Cork> abailarri: to start with stop going back to the if statement every time

[07:11:18] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: There's a 1 in there though.
[07:12:31] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: But I exactly want to match just 1 not 14. :(
[07:12:56] <BillCriswell> Can I see what you're trying to match against?
[07:15:35] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: nvm, I think I solved it :P

[07:26:17] <NoiseEee> mads-: yep
[07:26:19] <HelperW> mpol
[07:30:16] <BillCriswell> mads-: You can use a data attribute.
[07:31:43] <BillCriswell> Something like: <button data-toggle="#foo">Toggle #foo</button>, then do $('[data-toggle]').on('click', function() { $($(this).data('toggle')).toggle(); });

[07:50:26] <freeone3000> systemfault: Alright, got it. Thanks.

[07:52:45] <nagrat> hey all.
[07:52:52] <nagrat> I'm trying to create an input element with some code
[07:52:54] <nagrat> optionInp = $('<input type="text" class="JSONOption" optiontype="'+obj[item]['options'][option]['type']+'" value="'+obj[item]['options'][option]['value']+'" name="'+obj[item]['options'][option]['key']+'" />');
[07:53:06] <nagrat> but when I append the element to the dom the value is not inside the element
[07:53:31] <nagrat> the strange part is the first time I run the code (on page load) it works fine
[07:53:39] <nagrat> then subsequent calls don't work
[07:53:41] <BillCriswell> nagrat: Would need to see obj. How about making a quick demo at jsbin.com/jsfiddle.net
[07:54:10] <nagrat> hmm I'll see what I can do
[07:54:12] <systemfault> nagrat: Well.. start by decomposing that statement in two‚Ä¶ one to create the string‚Ä¶ the other to create the actual nodes‚Ä¶ and put a console.log in the middle.
[07:54:40] <nagrat> I'll give it a shot
[07:55:01] <nagrat> what part of the string should I gen first, the whole block inside <input > ?
[07:55:18] <nagrat> I've got a console.log with just the value and it seems to be there every time
[07:55:24] <nagrat> I'll break it down a little farther though
[07:55:28] <systemfault> nagrat: The idea is to know what markup was generate before you pass it to jQuery.
[07:55:34] <nagrat> makes sense
[07:55:35] <systemfault> *generated
[07:56:25] <systemfault> Also, you could programmatically set the value instead of using it to build the markup
[07:56:56] <systemfault> Like.. not set the value in the markup but do optionInp.val(obj[item]['options'][option]['value‚Äô]); after
[07:57:21] <nagrat> don't I have to do that after the element is appended to the dom
[07:57:49] <nagrat> the problem is this is one case in a switch that generates different input types, some of them checkboxes, so not all the items have a value this way
[07:57:59] <decx> man, that's a lot of [options]
[07:58:21] <nagrat> yeah, its ugly
[07:58:31] <nagrat> i should rename one of those
[07:58:45] <nagrat> but its a huge list, in a big switch that generates different input types
[07:58:56] <nagrat> with different values based on stuff passed down in the request
[08:01:31] <nagrat> hmm yeah the string looks right even when it doesn't work
[08:01:31] <nagrat> type="text" class="JSONOption" optiontype="TEXT" value="PRIORITY" name="Channel 24"
[08:01:44] <nagrat> I'll try setting the value programatically

[08:23:50] <skullcrasher> how can I get an object in .find with regex?
[08:24:52] <systemfault> skullcrasher: .find doesn‚Äôt work with regexes, you need to find something else.
[08:29:06] <skullcrasher> :/
[08:29:29] <systemfault> skullcrasher: So.. what do you want to do?
[08:29:56] <skullcrasher> i have a container element and a link
[08:30:19] <blake0509> Guys, is there a channel for knockout?
[08:30:20] <skullcrasher> if the link is clicked, the script should select an other containerelement
[08:30:50] <skullcrasher> as the ids are done via php i have to find the right container with regex
[08:31:42] <systemfault> skullcrasher: So, they don‚Äôt have classnames.. or any recognizable id? even if you could find them using regex, how would you do it?
[08:31:57] <blake0509> Anyone know of a good place to go for knockout help?
[08:33:04] <skullcrasher> I get the parent container of the link with .parents('classname') and save it in a variable
[08:33:33] <skullcrasher> now i try to use variable.find('#container')
[08:33:55] <skullcrasher> but it's #container + appended phpid
[08:34:07] <skullcrasher> so #container28 ...
[08:34:45] <skullcrasher> with regex i would have tried .find(/#chart\d+/);
[08:35:35] <systemfault> skullcrasher: Can‚Äôt you add a specific class name to those elements?
[08:36:18] <freeone3000> Couldn't you use a css selector such as '[id|=chart]'?
[08:36:33] <skullcrasher> well, there is the id
[08:36:45] <blake0509> Has anyone heard of knockout mapping an observable in debug mode but when the project is set to release mode the mapping is now a js object instead of a knockout observable? It keeps switching..

[08:37:25] <freeone3000> systemfault: It's in the spec, it's supported by jquery, it's supported by query...
[08:37:37] <freeone3000> systemfault: It's a little weird to do it on id, but I don't really see a huge problem.
[08:38:05] <brunoais> BTW, I'm running on Firefox 28
[08:38:26] <skullcrasher> systemfault: well as I said, the id is already set. but now it's the thing to find it.

[08:39:12] <freeone3000> nisseni: It's a SOAP endpoint. You probably want to use something a little thicker than JQuery to communicate with SOAP. (And it doesn't look like the REST API exposes that operation).
[08:39:48] <nisseni> freeone3000: no, the REST API doesn't. With thicker you mean, like cURL?
[08:41:01] <freeone3000> nisseni: Like https://cxf.apache.org/docs/javascript-clients.html or https://github.com/gtathub/js-soap-client .

[08:42:13] <freeone3000> nisseni: Though they also have a CURL input, so sure... https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/gs_PayPalAPIs/ is the bit if you don't want to use XML-RPC or SOAP, which you don't. Good luck.

[08:50:24] <freeone3000> brunoais: Well, triggering the event doesn't actually trigger the event here, but toggling the checkbox itself sends the alert just fine.
[08:50:30] <brunoais> EminenceHC, that way I can twicle with it ;)
[08:50:33] <skullcrasher> ok, did it with data attribute
[08:50:55] <brunoais> freeone3000, the trigger() of jQuery should place the event in the DOM, right?
[08:50:59] <decx> you can't trigger change
[08:51:07] <brunoais> decx, Oh yeah?
[08:51:11] <brunoais> pls wait, then
[08:51:14] <decx> that's what the US learned 6 years ago
[08:51:18] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[08:51:18] <freeone3000> brunoais: And if it were, say, 'wibblewobble', it'd be triggered.
[08:51:19] <decx> *burn*
[08:51:28] <duch_kazatel> ice burn brb lookin up burn centers
[08:51:30] <systemfault> decx: **clap**
[08:51:34] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/5yA79/31/
[08:51:36] <brunoais> decx, ^
[08:52:00] <decx> trigger('click') will do
[08:52:08] <freeone3000> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/5yA79/32/
[08:52:13] <brunoais> That code is out of my control
[08:52:20] <brunoais> I just copied and pasted there.
[08:52:29] <brunoais> The one above is mine
[08:52:35] <brunoais> it's in the middle of many other things
[08:53:07] <duch_kazatel> hey pancakes9 your html is all wrong.
[08:53:16] <brunoais> changing it means opening loads of tickets, cregs, pull requests, and other complicated borucracy stuff
[08:53:25] <brunoais> not to tell about testing and making new tests
[08:53:29] <freeone3000> brunoais: And the alternative is rewriting the browser spec.
[08:53:38] <brunoais> freeone3000, the spec is clear
[08:53:43] <brunoais> "change" event bubbles
[08:53:51] <brunoais> ... by default
[08:54:10] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 so i'd fix your html before trying to fix your other code.
[08:54:15] <freeone3000> brunoais: Well, okay, sure, but you can't trigger it. You can trigger your user event, you can trigger 'click', you can't trigger 'change'.
[08:55:22] <brunoais> "For input elements without a defined activation behavior, but to which these events apply, and for which the user interface involves both interactive manipulation and an explicit commit action, then when the user changes the element's value, the user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event that bubbles named input at the input element, and any time the user commits the change, the user agent mus
[08:55:22] <brunoais> t queue a task to fire a simple event that bubbles named change at the input element."
[08:55:35] <brunoais> freeone3000, see my 2nd fiddle
[08:55:39] <brunoais> I trigger a change event
[08:56:19] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: how is the html wrong? it's only a snippet
[08:56:33] <brunoais> freeone3000, http://jsfiddle.net/5yA79/31/
[08:56:37] <freeone3000> brunoais: Well, two things. First, <input type="checkbox"> *does* have a defined activation behavior. Second, you totally do get the event when the user checks the box.
[08:56:48] <freeone3000> brunoais: So you get the event peachy-keen, you just can't trigger it.
[08:56:52] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 you have an extra closing form tag and try to close that first input with onkeypress="retu>
[08:56:55] <duch_kazatel> missing a quote.
[08:56:55] <brunoais> freeone3000, it's just an equivalence
[08:57:05] <brunoais> that's not the real HTML
[08:57:10] <brunoais> that's not the actual js
[08:57:17] <EminenceHC> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZea3/
[08:57:21] <freeone3000> brunoais: So in short, *no part* of that code is useful?
[08:57:25] <brunoais> I'm not allowed by "our policies" to give that info
[08:57:39] <brunoais> freeone3000, that code is proof of concept
[08:58:03] <brunoais> there's a whole lot more of complexity behind what I'm using
[08:58:04] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 http://jsbin.com/cawusefi/5/edit for some minor corrections.
[08:58:04] <EminenceHC> brunoais: Ignore that, I can't do this in a fiddle there is just way too much bloat.
[08:58:19] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: oh i just pasted that incorrectly, :/
[08:58:21] <brunoais> EminenceHC, ok
[08:58:34] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: the main focus is the data-amount value changing
[08:58:43] <freeone3000> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/5yA79/33/ . You *cannot trigger change*.
[08:58:46] <pancakes9> when the total value changes
[08:58:47] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 it changes in the version i just pasted.
[08:58:55] <freeone3000> brunoais: You can trigger click, val, you can actually change it, but you can't trigger a change event.
[08:59:27] <brunoais> freeone3000, if I cannot trigger change, why does this work?
[08:59:27] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/5yA79/31/
[08:59:46] <freeone3000> brunoais: Doesn't work. It's not checked.
[09:00:03] <brunoais> freeone3000, click on the anchor
[09:00:15] <freeone3000> brunoais: Yeah, still doesn't end up checked.
[09:01:33] <NoiseEee> brunoais: so you're suggesting a bug in jquery then
[09:02:40] <brunoaiss> sorry about that
[09:02:49] <brunoaiss> for some reason this thing failed
[09:02:53] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: so you're suggesting a bug in jquery then
[09:03:03] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: yeah. I was just confirming that
[09:03:08] <brunoaiss> seems like it is a bug
[09:03:10] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: yeah it appears so
[09:03:28] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: i'd file it and link to two fiddles, one via jquery and one with initEvent/createEvent
[09:03:42] <brunoaiss> ok, so it seems it isn't filed
[09:04:10] <duch_kazatel> so you're not supposed to be able to .trigger() a change event?
[09:04:18] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: ok, I'll do that.
[09:04:25] <brunoaiss> duch_kazatel: no, not that
[09:04:33] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: you should be, but jquery doesn't seem to do it like natural JS does
[09:04:34] <duch_kazatel> sorry, barely paying attention here.
[09:04:38] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:04:42] <brunoaiss> the .trigger() for the change event is not direing the change event in the DOM
[09:04:59] <brunoaiss> so I have an issue because of that
[09:05:16] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: you might want to figure out if this just happens when you're watching the 'change' event of a non-input parent
[09:05:20] <brunoaiss> because what I'm being forced into using is using jQuery
[09:05:28] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: just for tips/better insight, but yes, change should bubble and that should work
[09:05:28] <brunoaiss> but my code I had made before doesn't
[09:05:55] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: well can't you just always use natural JS though in that case, as you demo'd
[09:05:57] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: ok. I'll file the bug
[09:06:09] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: I wish T.T
[09:06:16] <brunoaiss> I seriously wish
[09:06:23] <brunoaiss> but I'm forced ot use that thing
[09:06:34] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: okayyyy, you can't change that code at all?
[09:06:45] <brunoaiss> and justa dding the jQuery to the page is making is slower but it requires it
[09:06:51] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: nada
[09:06:59] <NoiseEee> brunoaiss: well good luck, seems like a legit bug
[09:07:02] <brunoaiss> nothing at all. I'm forced to use it as-is
[09:07:06] <Mindstorm8191> afternoon everyone.  Does anyone know how I can use a mysql table record value in a math statement? what I have is rougly SELECT *, TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(event.happens, NOW())) AS secondsLeft FROM event WHERE x=4;
[09:07:14] <brunoaiss> NoiseEee: ok. Thanks for the feedback. I'll reprot the bug
[09:07:25] <brunoaiss> maybe I can fix it myself and do a PR on jQuery
[09:08:44] <brunoais> finally back \o/
[09:09:03] <brunoais> k'ay, on with the bug
[09:10:26] <EminenceHC> I am looking for something like .prev or .closest without it having to be a parent element or not. For example I am trying to find the closest input to a div that has the class "remove_fields". What selector can I use?
[09:10:45] <duch_kazatel> you mean closest based on visual proximity?
[09:11:27] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: The closest in the DOM structure.
[09:12:16] <kegster> i use .find() to go inside something, and .closest() to go out (up the hierarchy, parents, etc)
[09:12:40] <duch_kazatel> i'd rethink the question - EminenceHC can you fiddle up a basic example to cover the cases you're considering?
[09:15:31] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: kegster: For example the last td in this table is a button with the class "remove_fields". When the button is clicked I would like to change the value of the input field in the preceding td.
[09:15:35] <TheWhisper> http://4nf.org/interface/ Can anyone explain what the "selector" property does for this plugin? I don't understand it.
[09:15:42] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: kegster: http://pastie.org/9100783
[09:16:10] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC could you give us the rendered HTML?
[09:16:46] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: so I've tried using .attr("data-amount", total) and .data("amount", total) and neither are updating my site
[09:16:51] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper looks like those are the things it hooks its bindings to.
[09:16:58] <TheWhisper> What does that mean exactly?
[09:17:39] <Justice> I have a list (UL) with an ID and when i click on a element (LI) i want to get the link that is in it. i tried to have a click function and then use this .attr(href) but that wont work any ideas how i should proceed?
[09:18:03] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper this plugin looks like it "ajaxes" the entire site, right?  that option is probably to change which links it runs its magic for and which ones it leaves alone.
[09:18:11] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Justice
[09:18:12] <b-ot> Justice: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:18:13] <TheWhisper> hm
[09:18:22] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 sounds like your selector is wrong or your HTML is bad.
[09:18:34] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: i'm going to message you the actual site
[09:18:53] <duch_kazatel> why not just paste it here?
[09:19:16] <_fox> .
[09:19:18] <pancakes9> dunno
[09:19:25] <BillCriswell> pancakes9 looks like an old AIM screenname. I like it.
[09:19:28] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/kU65d/
[09:19:34] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 you're throwing an error on change.
[09:19:59] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, and what about the "cb" property also listed?
[09:20:04] <Justice> duch_kazatel: here it is http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/
[09:20:32] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper ... that's the callback registration.  something to run when the ajax completes.
[09:20:37] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: duch_kazatel i do'nt see any errors
[09:20:39] <duch_kazatel> Justice that URL looks wrong.
[09:20:44] <TheWhisper> hm
[09:20:48] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: could you explain, please?
[09:20:51] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 enter a number and click out of that box.

[09:21:17] <TWH> Hey guys, I'm trying to implement a live graph on my site, and I had it working with the exact code I'm using now before. Since then we installed an SSL cert and it stopped working for some reason. There is a script block right after the graph (blank space on the site right now), but the problem is that this script block has a window.on(load) trigger and it is not firing at all for some reason. URL: https://portal.pool.enterprises/
[09:21:48] <TheWhisper> Basically, duch_kazatel, I'm trying to have function A run whenever the pronto.request event is sent. I also have Function B which I want to run /only/ when the pronto.request event is triggered by a certain subset of links.
[09:21:50] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC so which inputs are you worried about here?
[09:22:04] <TheWhisper> But I can't seem to specify that subset of links
[09:22:07] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: so if you go to pay with card and then enter a fake email and name and address on the next screen it says pay $0.00 although that should be updated
[09:22:13] <Justice> duch_kazatel: whats wrong with the url?
[09:22:16] <TheWhisper> Like I know what it is but I am not sure how to feed it to the plugin
[09:22:18] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Just the inputs labeled destroy in those two <td> elements.
[09:22:25] <pancakes9> that's the button i am trying to update associated with the data-amoutn field
[09:22:26] <duch_kazatel> Justice you didn't save anything there - you need to save and then send that URL.
[09:22:40] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: The link to the right of them should change their values.
[09:22:47] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 you need to fix that error first.
[09:23:54] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC so you're trying to create a handler for .remove_fields that then changes the value of the "nearest" .changemeh ?
[09:24:12] <duch_kazatel> because my solution for these things is always clunky but I do it for clarity's sake.
[09:24:13] <Justice> duch_kazatel: the page var should get the link from the link attr and then put it to the loadpage function
[09:24:18] <Justice> or am i missing something hefe
[09:24:20] <Justice> here*
[09:24:24] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Yes, but I would rather have it find the nearest input without having to specify a class name.
[09:24:30] <duch_kazatel> Justice you need to save the paste and then share that link with me.
[09:24:41] <duch_kazatel> Justice because the link you sent was the "create new paste" page.
[09:24:56] <Justice> oh nwm just noticed that hahaha
[09:24:59] <Justice> nwm 1 sec...
[09:24:59] <ozoness> Hi guys! How can I do $('li.submenu').on('click', 'a', toggleSubmenu); and pass that element to the toggleSubmenu function?
[09:24:59] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC i'd traverse the document in that case instead of trying to craft together some clever selector.
[09:25:13] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: okay, i removed it, what next?
[09:25:18] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: How can I accomplish that?
[09:25:18] <Justice> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7308178/
[09:25:19] <duch_kazatel> $(this) inside of toggleSubmenu, ozoness
[09:25:23] <Justice> duch_kazatel: sorry long day :P
[09:25:36] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC .parents() to find the shared container and go from there.
[09:26:05] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Would the shared container be <tr>?
[09:26:38] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC sure, for that fieldset outside of the table.
[09:26:40] <ozoness> duch_kazatel: ouch, that was easy :S thanks ;)
[09:26:41] <duch_kazatel> however you want to di it.
[09:26:43] <duch_kazatel> *do it
[09:27:07] <duch_kazatel> Justice you're bound to the UL, not the A.
[09:27:28] <Justice> yeah that was my thought too but how should i proceed to get the a?
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> Justice you want to do $('#nav').on("click", 'a', function (e) {
[09:27:40] <Justice> oh
[09:27:48] <duch_kazatel> or $('#nav a').on("click", function (e) {
[09:27:58] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: There are multiple inputs in each tr, How do I select the closest one to my link?
[09:28:09] <duch_kazatel> the first uses event delegation and makes you cool, the other is a direct binding.
[09:28:27] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC be explicit, not implicit - select the proper class.
[09:28:47] <duch_kazatel> instead of relying on an arbitrary "closes" definition.
[09:28:49] <duch_kazatel> *closest
[09:29:25] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I guess it would just be easier to use the class on the input like you mentioned before. Closest input with class "changemeh"
[09:29:46] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC i'd really just find that parent tr and then run a .find() from there.
[09:29:51] <duch_kazatel> but that's me.
[09:29:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah that makes sense
[09:30:10] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 so what data are you trying to set in here again?  on what?
[09:31:34] <GreekFreak> hi all
[09:31:53] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 because i'm seeing the data update, but use $('.stripe-button').data('amount') instead of what you're doing now.
[09:32:35] <GreekFreak> I am using the DateTimePicker plugin for jquery. http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/    As it was recommended on the jQuery site, I wanted to know if there was any way to get it to use the jquery-ui theme I am using
[09:34:25] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: i have another variable stotal which i want to replace it with
[09:34:38] <Justice> duch_kazatel: thanks man it works perfectly
[09:34:46] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: so i want data-amount to be replaced by stotal whenever the total changes
[09:35:19] <duch_kazatel> Justice sure.
[09:35:28] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 that's what you're doing right now.
[09:35:46] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: yeah but for some reason in that stripe javascript modal the button keeps saying $0.00
[09:36:15] <pancakes9> and if i change data-amoutn manually it does change
[09:36:28] <duch_kazatel> where should i see the price?
[09:36:50] <brunoais> "Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)"
[09:36:53] <brunoais> WOOT?
[09:36:55] <pancakes9> if you click the pay button you need to enter a fake email and name and address and click the payment info button
[09:37:07] <pancakes9> duch_kazatel: then on the next screen it will have a button with the price
[09:37:52] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 oh, i get it.  no clue man, i don't know how stripe's online checkout stuff works.
[09:37:57] <brunoais> NoiseEee, can you help here?
[09:38:17] <duch_kazatel> pancakes9 i'd check to make sure you're binding things to the right elements.
[09:38:42] <NoiseEee> brunoais: hmm, no :P
[09:39:03] <brunoais> T.T
[09:39:07] <brunoais> I can't file the bug
[09:40:42] <NoiseEee> yo ajpiano / danheberden, re: cannot file bug, see brunoais
[09:44:26] <brunoais> NoiseEee, I have to leave for a while. I'll be waiting for ajpiano or danheberden's answer. I should take about 40 mins
[09:44:28] <brunoais> o/
[09:48:18] <innociv_> How do I replace the text in an element for just the element that actually has it, when I'm selecting one of its parents? It's replacing all the html of the children and adding the text to that parent
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> innociv_ you mean just the textnode of the parent element and no along with the child nodes?
[09:49:58] <innociv_> var $el = $('<div><span>foo</span></div>');  if( $el.text() === 'foo' ) $el.text('bar');   result: <div>bar</div>  should be <div><span>bar</span><div>
[09:51:01] <duch_kazatel> aaaahg.
[09:51:31] <duch_kazatel> *aaah.  that'll require a bit of extra work to parse through the textnodes manually.
[09:51:57] <innociv_> .find('*:contains("foo")') will return both elements
[09:52:06] <duch_kazatel> right, because they both contain that textNod.e
[09:52:18] <innociv_> I need to find the actual element with the textnode, not what contains that element with it.
[09:52:22] <duch_kazatel> RIGHT.
[09:52:25] <duch_kazatel> *right - one sec.
[09:53:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/WQH5u/
[09:53:59] <duch_kazatel> jquery has funky support for textnodes.
[09:54:13] <duch_kazatel> so you have to manually walk through the tree nstead.
[09:54:17] <duch_kazatel> *instead
[09:54:46] <Cork> or simply put a class on the element and select based on that :)
[09:54:54] <duch_kazatel> yep :)
[09:54:55] <Cork> j/s
[09:55:00] <duch_kazatel> or the span itself.
[09:55:08] <innociv_> Thanks
[09:56:01] <giustoXricordarl> imparami sto ballo per la prossima sett. http://youtu.be/RjG-podqbl8
[09:56:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:57:12] <duch_kazatel> you're learning to dance next week?
[09:57:21] <innociv_> Hm you're right. Why am I not just putting a class on this.
[09:57:59] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:58:14] <giustoXricordarl> lol wrong server :P
[09:58:18] <innociv_> One reason is it's hard to think of a good class name.
[09:58:36] <duch_kazatel> giustoXricordarl you spammed two rooms btw ;)
[09:58:36] <innociv_> My of my manipulation goes based on property keys as class names which has no match on this.
[09:58:37] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:58:45] <decx> i'd call it "dance class"
[09:58:49] <innociv_> Let me ask uhh
[09:58:52] <giustoXricordarl> xchat fuk
[09:59:22] <giustoXricordarl> i spammed onto different server
[09:59:49] <innociv_> Like I have <div class="online"><span>Online</span><other stuff/></div>.  Is there css to just make .online span contain the text "Online"?  Then when I remove online and add offline..
[10:00:29] <decx> .online span:after { content: "online"} .offline span:after { content: "offline" }
[10:01:27] <Cork> innociv_: <span class="on">Online</span><span class="off">Offline</span> div .on { display: none } div.online .on { display: inline; } div.online .off { display: none; }
[10:01:44] <decx> dat ux keyword clutter -.-
[10:01:45] <Cork> innociv_: that way you have the text where it belongs in the html
[10:01:48] <decx> ui*
[10:01:58] <Cork> and css and js does what they are meant to do
[10:02:13] <Cork> decx: well try handling translating if you move the text into css
[10:02:16] <Cork> it sucks big time
[10:02:27] <innociv_> Ah. It seems like lots of html uses up more memory than script logic does, though.
[10:02:47] <innociv_> When you have hundreds of users with all those different states of html..
[10:02:57] <Cork> innociv_: dom nodes isn't free ya, but then your better of loading parts of the page as you need it
[10:03:14] <innociv_> that's how I'm doing it now.  Changing the text so it's jsut one dom node.
[10:03:17] <decx> i give you that, [lang=en] .fifty .layers .of selectors:after is a bit busy
[10:03:18] <Cork> small nodes like that usually shouldn't matter
[10:03:54] <decx> but i like the concept to keep the content on a page 100% relevant
[10:03:56] <Cork> decx: also unicode i content: isn't fun
[10:04:14] <Cork> decx: well it is relevant
[10:04:39] <Cork> if you want to go to that extent then you shouldn't have the span or the info from it three at all
[10:06:36] <innociv_> The thing is there can be more than online offline
[10:06:42] <innociv_> Idle, maybe other things.
[10:06:50] <innociv_> And if I use that same design in other areas... it's even more.
[10:07:12] <Cork> innociv_: ya, it only works when you have a limited number of options
[10:07:16] <innociv_> I'm trying to keep the markup minimal as in my experience I've noticed it helps keep memory usage down a ton. Way more than adding more script logic to manipulate it.
[10:07:18] <Cork> a state kind of thing
[10:07:34] <innociv_> I thought there was like the content: node in css or something. I'unno
[10:07:51] <Cork> innociv_: i've had the complete opposite experience :)
[10:08:26] <innociv_> Well sure things like angular.js can be awful performance. But that's stateful and not event driven.
[10:09:57] <Cork> innociv_: my experience is that you get better performance from reducing the amount of js you use as much as you can
[10:10:13] <Cork> innociv_: and then instead progressively load it when you need it
[10:10:30] <Cork> like infinite scroll instead of loading the entire page
[10:10:34] <Cork> (for example)
[10:10:54] <innociv_> Not true at all.  Like "this is a string I want the first word of".split(" ")[0] is going to be FAR slower than code that's much longer using .indexOf(" ") and .slice()
[10:11:26] <Cork> not sure how that has anything to do with what i just said...
[10:11:40] <innociv_> You said less code is more efficient.  That's not nessisarily true at all.
[10:12:01] <Cork> innociv_: i meant not shorter code, i meant remove code all together
[10:12:22] <Cork> and then have the code you write utilize what the browser gives you as much as you can
[10:13:05] <TWH> Hey guys, I'm trying to implement a live graph on my site, and I had it working with the exact code I'm using now before. Since then we installed an SSL cert and it stopped working for some reason. There is a script block right after the graph (blank space on the site right now), but the problem is that this script block has a window.on(load) trigger and it is not firing at all for some reason. URL: https://portal.pool.enterprises/
[10:15:13] <Cork> heh theres a .enterprices now?
[10:17:00] <shoky> TWH: the window.on('load' isn't running because  the line   if (typeof charts == 'undefined') return;
[10:17:02] <shoky> does a return ;p
[10:17:25] <TWH> shoky: Ah, makes sense..
[10:17:30] <Cork> TWH: also you have quite a bit of errors in your html
[10:18:11] <TWH> Cork: I am aware of that, thanks tho!
[10:20:54] <msafi> Anyone know how to check FPS on Safari Web Inspector?
[10:24:12] <TWH> shoky: And how would I approach to troubleshoot charts not being defined. The file js file for flot gets loaded normally, without errors..
[10:27:51] <Cork> TWH: charts is defined in flow.common.js but your loading it after the script you have inline
[10:29:50] <TWH> Cork: Did you mean flotcharts.common.js?
[10:30:05] <Cork> TWH: yes
[10:30:20] <Cork> TWH: but you prob want to move all the scripts the inline block depends on before it
[10:31:46] <TWH> Cork: Thank you bro, everything working as intended now. *highfive*

[10:46:10] <LeonardDa> hey guys. I'm having troubles with Jquery's .show(). I have to <span>-tags. In the middle there is an image. When I do hide the <span> and then show them with Jquery: First the <span> tags appear in the wrong line. If the animation is finished they jump to the right line. Can anyone help me please?
[10:46:56] <LeonardDa> I'm desperate
[10:47:09] <duch_meeting> !paste @ LeonardDa
[10:47:10] <b-ot> LeonardDa: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:47:24] <LeonardDa> duch_meeting: Ok my friend
[10:51:24] <BillCriswell> I feel like a crazy person, should .animate() with { queue: false } on two different elements make the animations happen at the same time?
[10:53:19] <TheWhisper> For some reason my mobile.css changes are being removed
[10:53:20] <Cork> BillCriswell: shouldn't matter if you set queue: false if it is on different elements
[10:53:26] <TheWhisper> whenever I trigger a jquery function
[10:53:28] <TheWhisper> and I can't tell why
[10:53:44] <LeonardDa> Here is the link: http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/
[10:54:01] <TheWhisper> The page is here: http://discoverdan.com/work.html
[10:54:08] <TheWhisper> If you make the browser width < 777 px
[10:54:13] <LeonardDa> As I said: When the animation happens, the two span-tags and the image appear in the wrong line. But when the animation is finished they jump into the right line
[10:54:16] <TheWhisper> and then click on one of the thumbnails
[10:54:31] <TheWhisper> the mobile.css stuff all disappears
[10:54:36] <skip> Can a JQuery slider be in a round window?
[10:54:42] <TheWhisper> It's like it doesn't recognize that it's still < 777 wide
[10:54:51] <BillCriswell> Cork: Hm.
[10:55:03] <Cork> skip: yes
[10:55:17] <zackattack> Anyone have a favorite jQuery-style combobox that allows you to select multiple items (with autocomplete) and click an 'x' to delete them?
[10:55:18] <skip> thank you, Cork ‚Ä¶I guess that's all about the CSS...
[10:55:29] <Cork> skip: shou
[10:55:30] <Cork> opps
[10:55:42] <Cork> *why would a slider care about the window it's in?
[10:55:54] <BillCriswell> Cork: This will not cooperate with me lol
[10:56:07] <Cork> BillCriswell: what are you trying to do?
[10:56:17] <BillCriswell> A crossfade basically.
[10:56:31] <LeonardDa> So I don't understand why Jquery causes this wrong positioning when I do the animation
[10:57:41] <Mindstorm8191> cork: I think its the same reason dogs don't care if their hair is laying over their eyes - they justdon't know that there are better options
[10:57:56] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[10:58:12] <decx> that's because dogs can't look up
[10:58:29] <duch_kazatel> they also use their eyes far less than we do.
[10:58:48] <mojo-jojo> Can someone pls help take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/P92Ww/  the reset link isn't working
[10:58:51] <Mindstorm8191> decx: sure they can. mine does
[10:59:23] <decx> well you sir haven't watched shaun of the dead

[11:00:05] <Cork> BillCriswell: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/58Myn/
[11:00:07] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo line 3 isn't what you think it is.
[11:00:11] <BillCriswell> heading back to the winchester.
[11:00:40] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel what am I missing?
[11:00:42] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo http://jsfiddle.net/P92Ww/1/
[11:00:47] <BillCriswell> Cork: Hmm.. exactly what I have. What the fuck am I doing wrong.
[11:00:57] <duch_kazatel> .parent() was hitting the parent form-group div
[11:01:14] <mojo-jojo> aha
[11:01:16] <mojo-jojo> I see
[11:01:48] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel thanks much. Could you shed more light though, against next time?
[11:01:55] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo huh?
[11:01:59] <Cork> BillCriswell: though note, you can do that without having to have two animations
[11:03:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah, just have to get my stacks right and fadeOut the top.
[11:03:11] <Cork> exactly
[11:03:16] <LeonardDa> can't anyone help out?
[11:03:36] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel I see you changed 'parent' to 'parents' didn't realize I could do that. I don't have a lot of experience with this.
[11:03:42] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa i'll take a look now.
[11:03:59] <zackattack> I think I'm going with this one
[11:03:59] <zackattack> http://sproutsocial.github.io/inputosaurus-text/#
[11:04:02] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Thank you my friend :). I felt neglected for some short time :D
[11:04:19] <duch_kazatel> i was in a meeting originally.  let me fix the fiddle first.
[11:04:58] <mojo-jojo> duch_kazatel thanks man!
[11:05:07] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo sure.
[11:05:07] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/1/
[11:05:26] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa i'll assume you want each animation to happen in succession, instead of all at once?
[11:05:27] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I only see one text
[11:05:50] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Yes. But the main problem are the wrong positionings
[11:06:02] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa do you need help with css or jquery
[11:06:02] <duch_kazatel> ?
[11:06:26] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Yes that would be nice, as I don't know what the problem is
[11:06:40] <duch_kazatel> that's an either/or question, not a yes/no.
[11:06:44] <duch_kazatel> which do you need help with?
[11:07:17] <tpyo> any known issues with safari and jquery?
[11:07:26] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I need to solve this positioning problem. I don't know why this mispositioning occurs. I would need help in CSS I think
[11:07:42] <duch_kazatel> okay - i'd suggest asking in #css for that then.
[11:08:07] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Isn't this caused by Jquery?
[11:08:14] <tpyo> i have a bit of code that grabs an element and returns the jquery wrapper. On all other browsers it returns the object fine, however in Safari when I console.log I get the html fragment instead of the javascript wrapper
[11:08:45] <tpyo> even weirder if I open this page in a new tab or window safari then errors when it calls wrapper.css() (css is undefined and not a function)
[11:08:47] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa then what position are you confused by?
[11:09:07] <tpyo> but this call works fine if its opened in the main window of safari :S
[11:09:22] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I want to appear the elements at their original / right position when the animation happens and not appear in a wrong place.
[11:09:22] <tpyo> has anyone experienced this sort of strangeness on safari?
[11:09:23] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ tpyo
[11:09:23] <b-ot> tpyo: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:09:35] <mctim> how can i tell when a modal window gets closed?  it closes when i click anywhere outside of it.  my angular directive is unaware of its disappearance
[11:09:42] <tpyo> well i guess that's a no then
[11:09:56] <duch_kazatel> tpyo we'd need to see your code to see what's going on.
[11:10:16] <tpyo> "has anyone else experienced this sort of strangeness"
[11:10:21] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa how am I supposed to know where you want them to appear if they're not in the right place currently?
[11:10:23] <tpyo> so im guessing you're saying no to that
[11:11:01] <duch_kazatel> tpyo 9/10 when you're having issues like that it means you're doing something a little unusual.  jquery and safari should be a fine combo.
[11:11:07] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I want them to appear in the same line. But the appear in different lines, when the animation happens
[11:11:16] <tpyo> thanks for the clarification duch_kazatel
[11:12:04] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa sounds like you might need to refactor your animations then.
[11:13:09] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: What do you mean?
[11:14:12] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa let me format your css and html and try to whip up an example.
[11:14:31] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Ok thanks buddy
[11:14:33] <decx> what's that image in the second span
[11:14:39] <tpyo> timing issue or a different means of scoping javascript
[11:14:58] <tpyo> so what worked out okay in the other browsers didn't work here
[11:15:20] <tpyo> ie the variable was initialised in one tab but then the other tab couldn't access that same variable anymore
[11:15:28] <tpyo> interesting how this worked on all the other browsers
[11:15:29] <duch_kazatel> tpyo you mean a browser tab?
[11:15:33] <tpyo> yes
[11:15:46] <duch_kazatel> because it's sounding more and more like you're doing something way off.
[11:15:52] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't be able to access vars "cross tab"
[11:17:00] <tpyo> well ultimately its a bug in my app
[11:17:11] <tpyo> just curious how its handled in the other browsers
[11:17:15] <tpyo> and how safari trips up
[11:17:37] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/2/
[11:17:42] <duch_kazatel> this is a basic start
[11:18:07] <tpyo> its my bad for trying to re-use code/variables :D
[11:18:08] <jphaser> hmm, *how* invalid exactly is sticking a <div> in place of a <tr> in a table lol?
[11:18:09] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I know that. But you removed the image
[11:18:12] <duch_kazatel> tpyo wut?
[11:18:13] <tpyo> i have bad habits from client development
[11:18:16] * jphaser searches for the path of least resistance
[11:18:23] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa sure - but this should get you started.
[11:18:38] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa feel free to add in an actual image,
[11:18:42] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: I knew that before. My problem is how to get all of them into the same line
[11:18:56] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: ok i'm trying
[11:19:05] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/2/embedded/result/
[11:19:10] <duch_kazatel> there's your one line.
[11:19:36] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: But you also removed a lot of other css-stuff which is necessary for centering the div
[11:19:54] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa that's separate from what you're trying to do.  i can fix that pretty easily.
[11:19:55] <duch_kazatel> so could you.
[11:20:09] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: OK then I'M trying your solution my friend
[11:20:31] <duch_kazatel> how tall is your image?
[11:20:58] <decx> man these effects are strange
[11:21:17] <decx> it's replacing these spans with divs while it's animating
[11:21:29] <decx> doesnt that seem strange to anyone else
[11:22:26] <duch_kazatel> that seems reall weird.
[11:22:37] <duch_kazatel> probably for the positioning?
[11:23:23] <decx> no idea, but that explains why it started in a new row before, it changed an inline to a div, and without that float it went from inline to block
[11:24:23] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa here's one way to skin that cat: http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/6/
[11:24:40] <decx> just look at that, what the hell is going on http://i.imgur.com/OJN3tQc.png
[11:24:53] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[11:35:34] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Look, the same problem:http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/11/
[11:36:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:36:06] <duch_kazatel> what's the problem with this one?
[11:36:28] <Yahkob> anyone have experience with timeago?
[11:36:34] <LeonardDa> the text left and right of the image are not vertically centered
[11:37:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/43vgG/12/
[11:37:51] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa because we're using floats, you'll have to apply some extra wrangling to your styles, but it's easy stuff.
[11:38:25] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: As soon as I change the height the problem occurs.
[11:38:43] <duch_kazatel> LeonardDa aaaand again - because we're using floats, you'll have to apply some extra wrangling to your styles, but it's easy stuff.
[11:38:54] <duch_kazatel> stop putting styles in your html btw.
[11:39:03] <duch_kazatel> do it in your css files/the css pane in the fiddle.
[11:41:23] <LeonardDa> duch_katzel: Thank you. Now I got what you mean
[11:41:49] <LeonardDa> But it's somehow sad. New standard like HTML5 but still dirty tricks to solve this stuff
[11:42:14] <duch_kazatel> you could always clear the floats, but this really isn't a problem with html.
[11:42:33] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of ways to fix problems like this.
[11:46:19] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: What would be a more portable solution?
[11:46:29] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:46:33] <duch_kazatel> "poprtable"?
[11:47:01] <duch_kazatel> *portable
[11:48:15] <LeonardDa> duch_kazatel: Ok I'm trying out your solution

[11:59:40] <LeonardDa> how can I first execute 1 animation and 2 seconds later another animation?
[12:00:38] <LeonardDa> I mean how can I delay?
[12:00:54] <marc_v92> LeonardDa: Use the setTimeout() command.

[12:02:53] <hesco> ok, so that novalidate is expected I guess.
[12:06:37] <oniMaker> How can I do a callback on $.post if the request fails (403) ?

[12:08:42] <hesco> Looking at this example from the jquery.validation docs:  <input id="cname" name="name" minlength="2" type="text" required/>
[12:08:44] <hesco> I'm guessing that jquery.validation is looking at the type attribute, the required (what would I call that, is that also an attribute?), the minlength, but ignores the rest, unless I am writing an explicit rule.  If I do so, is the rule key'd off the id, or the name?  Can anyone confirm my assumptions for me, please?
[12:09:15] <duch_kazatel> hesco could you link the docs?
[12:09:31] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation
[12:09:38] <oniMaker> duch_kazatel: cool thanks
[12:11:02] <duch_kazatel> hesco so you're wanting confirmation that the plugin reads those attributes?
[12:12:26] <duch_kazatel> also, "is the rule key'd off the id, or the name?" huh?
[12:12:39] <hesco> yes, duch_kazatel, trying to sort out which the plugin require and which its ignoring
[12:13:45] <hesco> duch_kazatel: See the rules defined here:  view-source:http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[12:13:54] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking at http://jqueryvalidation.org/reference/
[12:13:59] <duch_kazatel> i don't care about the other stuff.
[12:15:34] <duch_kazatel> hesco read the page i linked.  i'd dump through the docs but I have to go to lunch.  enjoy.

[12:37:39] <g2nightmare> would you be able to help
[12:37:54] <BillCriswell> It seems pretty straight forward. What's the issue?
[12:38:15] <Bardamu> Hi I have a div A with forms. This form appears when I hover another div B (which is inside A). When I leave the div A, the div A hides. But in the case of when I click on the input and I leave div A ,  I want that doesn't hide
[12:38:18] <g2nightmare> i have zero knowledge of jquery
[12:38:23] <g2nightmare> and i'm in a time crunch
[12:38:24] <Bardamu> someone has a technique ?
[12:38:30] <g2nightmare> that's the issue, i guess
[12:39:16] <erming> Bardamu: you have an event, like, on("mouseout", .. hide ..)? How do you hide/show these forms
[12:39:33] <Bardamu> sorry I mean I hide/show the div A
[12:40:09] <Bardamu> firstly it shows div A when I hover div B..
[12:40:20] <BillCriswell> You include jQuery, then this plugin then you put another script tag with $('input[type=file]').parse({ complete: function (data) { // Do what youw ant with data here... } });
[12:40:22] <Bardamu> and when I leave div A it hides
[12:40:28] <Bardamu> div A
[12:40:34] <erming> You could check if the input is focused.. So, something like this: if ($("input").is(":focus")) { /* dont hide */ }
[12:40:47] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: It has to be in a script tag.
[12:40:48] <Bardamu> ok thanks!
[12:40:55] <Bardamu> it was what I need :)
[12:41:07] <erming> Hope it works out for you, good luck :>
[12:41:32] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: ok, but does the input type go in the script tag as well?
[12:41:41] <g2nightmare> right now, nothing shows up when I put it in the script tag
[12:42:45] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: <input type="file"> above <script src="../whatever/jquery.js"></script> <script src="../whatever/papaparse.js"></script> <script> $('input[type=file]').parse({ complete: function (data) { console.log(data); }}); </script>
[12:44:48] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: http://gyazo.com/edb3b18cf0d6908d728baf4048306354
[12:45:03] <g2nightmare> hmm gyazo must be down
[12:45:07] <g2nightmare> that aws supposed to be a screenshot
[12:45:33] <g2nightmare> well the input type file works, but literally no jquery is being executed
[12:46:55] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: do you have any idea why it may not work?
[12:52:45] <hesco> using jquery.validate, this line vreaks my js, throwing "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token = " to the console:
[12:52:47] <hesco> "prospect.fname": { required: true, minlength => 2 },
[12:52:54] <hesco> any idea how I might resolve that?
[12:53:28] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: This documentation is a bit misleading.
[12:53:46] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: is it the wrong application for me ?
[12:54:40] <g2nightmare> the documentation sucks for beginners
[12:54:47] <g2nightmare> i just want a simple way to parse a csv file
[12:54:56] <g2nightmare> i have other things to worry about
[12:55:00] <hesco> ah, I think I need colons, rather than fat commas
[13:04:16] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: You have to add that parse thing after there's a file set on the input.
[13:04:49] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: so how do I handle that?
[13:05:20] <g2nightmare> this application is in jsp
[13:05:29] <g2nightmare> so do i get the file element and check if its empty or something?
[13:09:09] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: http://jsbin.com/tukoraki/1/edit?js,output The code is towards the bottom, but it should get you started.
[13:09:34] <BillCriswell> I just have the min verison of parse at the top.
[13:10:09] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: were you able to get anything working?
[13:11:37] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: because I don't understand how you got a "choose file" button and a "parse" button but I didn't
[13:12:15] <ankurk_> g2nightmare: It's a input type="file" element
[13:12:34] <g2nightmare> ankurk_: i know this, but this is supposed to either use that element or create it's own
[13:12:39] <g2nightmare> i'm unsure which
[13:13:27] <ankurk_> This might give you some insight, http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.file.html
[13:13:58] <g2nightmare> ankurk_ you misunderstood what i'm trying to do
[13:14:03] <g2nightmare> i'm trying to get something called papa parse to work
[13:14:04] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: The button isn't needed. That wouldn't add items elements for you automatically.
[13:14:39] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: but I do want the page to refresh upon submitting the button. it's doable right?
[13:14:54] <g2nightmare> because the information is going to be dynamic
[13:16:17] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: Are you just using this to check to see if they entered a not empty file?
[13:18:08] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: ideally, i want the user to select a csv file and then hit the submit button. when submitted, the csv is parsed and it is going to run some queries to a database and display information
[13:18:35] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: You should be doing this stuff on the server side.
[13:18:57] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: the csv files are going to be small and it's supposed to be a simple application
[13:18:57] <dKc> anyone here was using jquery file upload plugin?
[13:19:59] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: That would be best done on the server.
[13:21:13] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: ideally yeah, but we're not allowed to upload files to the server we are working with
[13:21:31] <g2nightmare> it's supposed to be a simple application for teachers to query test scores but the server are on should not store these kinds of files
[13:22:19] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: by the way, I think your code helped me. it looked as though the small change you made seems to work
[13:22:28] <g2nightmare> now i just need a way to grab this information on submission :S
[13:24:56] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: So do you want to add the CSV to a textarea kinda?
[13:25:31] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: not quite, when the user submits, i want a query to be performed based on what's in the csv, and then it will output some charts/tables
[13:26:39] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: You'll need to send that data to the server though.
[13:27:14] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: yes i'm using jsp. I'll likely have a java object to handle that
[13:31:25] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: You need to send the data to the server so jsp can do whatever it does though I imagine.
[13:31:54] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell $('input[type=file]').on('submit', .........
[13:31:58] <g2nightmare> does this kind of thing exist?
[13:32:18] <drej> a specific input doesnt have a submit event iirc
[13:32:21] <g2nightmare> if i can output the jquery to a java object, i should be ok
[13:32:23] <BillCriswell> g2nightmare: You would want to do it on the submit of the form.
[13:32:24] <drej> the submit is on the form, not the input
[13:34:13] <g2nightmare> yes i realize that.. but how does jquery know to run when the form is submit?
[13:34:22] <g2nightmare> and when you submit the form, the chosen file is reset back to blank
[13:36:08] <ankurk_> yo drej, I loved the pic of your workspace on Twitter :D
[13:36:20] <drej> ankurk_ thanks bud :)
[13:36:35] <drej> i just got a new ipad mini retina and ipad air to add to the collection
[13:36:38] <drej> picked them up an hour ago
[13:36:51] <ankurk_> OMG both?
[13:37:07] <drej> yup
[13:37:24] <drej> im doing some android and ios-specific development so i have to test everything
[13:37:30] <ankurk_> make sure you include that in your new pic :D
[13:37:38] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: would this be a better option? https://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/
[13:37:39] <drej> haha will do
[13:37:43] <ankurk_> moreover, is desk an ikea one?
[13:37:45] <drej> that last pic was only like 1/3rd of my devices
[13:37:47] <ankurk_> *your
[13:37:57] <drej> yeah its an ikea desk but one of their "more expensive" ones
[13:38:08] <drej> if anyone's curious about what we're talking about: http://cl.ly/image/0U373u2e290F
[13:38:25] <Synthead> if I were to add "<h3>Hello World</h3>" to a div with id "foo", what is the cleanest way to do this in jQuery?
[13:38:42] <Synthead> I could use .add() and put the entire snippet in there, but that seems hacky
[13:40:19] <__joshua__> $('<h3/>).text('Hello World).attr('id', 'foo').appendTo(somediv);
[13:41:16] <__joshua__> oh
[13:41:27] <__joshua__> $('<h3/>).text('Hello World').appendTo('#foo');
[13:43:13] <Yahkob> Can't figure this out.. timeago is supposed to refresh the timestamp you use jQuery.timeago() with but it wont refresh
[13:43:14] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/dekur/1/edit
[13:44:52] <Yahkob> I didn't want to put all the code in there because theres quite a bit I'm just trying to figure out if thats a bad spot for it if it cant refresh there..
[13:45:09] <oddalot> test
[13:45:21] <oddalot> irssi is hard lol
[13:52:45] <g2nightmare> BillCriswell: <form onsubmit="$('input[type=file]').parse({before: function(file) {console.log(file.size);},complete: function(results, file, inputElem, event) {console.log(results.results.rows);}});">
[13:52:48] <g2nightmare> would that work?
[13:53:08] <duch_lunch> g2nightmare do not put code in your html like that.
[13:53:23] <g2nightmare> i just want things to work first
[13:54:04] <duch_kazatel> right - a great first step is not putting js in your html like that :)
[13:54:17] <g2nightmare> dude, i know, i just want to know if that would work
[13:54:49] <drej> well, does it work ?
[13:54:56] <drej> try it and see?
[13:55:09] <g2nightmare> well it writes to the console but then the console gets erased because the page refreshes
[13:55:12] <g2nightmare> so i would assume yes
[13:55:21] <g2nightmare> but ultimately i want to get that information and put it somewhere else
[13:55:23] <g2nightmare> like in jsp
[13:55:27] <duch_kazatel> you can persist the console btw.
[13:55:32] <g2nightmare> how?
[13:55:57] <g2nightmare> oh found it
[13:56:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/UCvVL/ looks like it should work.
[13:58:03] <g2nightmare> ?
[13:58:22] <g2nightmare> it only logs the file size for some reason
[13:58:23] <duch_kazatel> i put the code in a fiddle because it was super hard to read otherwise.
[13:58:49] <duch_kazatel> what lib is .parse() apart of?
[14:00:23] <g2nightmare> papa parse
[14:00:27] <g2nightmare> web development sucks
[14:00:35] <g2nightmare> i just want to parse a csv file this is ridiculous
[14:01:11] <duch_kazatel> this is pretty simpl.
[14:01:13] <duch_kazatel> *simple
[14:01:54] <g2nightmare> not really
[14:02:49] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[14:02:58] <ankurk_> g2nightmare, why not write a script in the backend and send an ajax request to that script?
[14:03:10] <g2nightmare> 1) because i have no idea how to do any of that
[14:03:17] <g2nightmare> 2) that's outside the scope i wanted for this project
[14:03:22] <g2nightmare> 3) i'm just trying to do a simple csv parse
[14:03:25] <ankurk_> Use a PHP library like PHPExcel
[14:03:29] <duch_kazatel> you want to parse a csv file in the browser?
[14:03:30] <g2nightmare> 4) i'm not using php
[14:03:36] <g2nightmare> it doesn't mtter how
[14:03:47] <g2nightmare> here's what i'm using: postgresql, jsp, java, and html
[14:03:52] <g2nightmare> that's all i intend to use
[14:04:04] <NoiseEee> and javascript?
[14:04:07] <g2nightmare> yeah
[14:04:10] <g2nightmare> that too
[14:04:15] <NoiseEee> http://mounirmesselmeni.github.io/2012/11/20/javascript-csv/
[14:04:19] <duch_kazatel> okay - parse it server-side imo.
[14:05:00] <NoiseEee> yeah if you plan on actually doing anything backend with the parsed csv, do it on the backend. if you're just showing information, use javascript.
[14:05:04] <duch_kazatel> fwiw http://jsfiddle.net/UCvVL/1/
[14:05:13] <duch_kazatel> works in chrom.
[14:05:15] <g2nightmare> ok then i should parse it server side
[14:05:18] <duch_kazatel> err firefox
[14:05:25] <g2nightmare> should i parse it in java?
[14:05:29] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[14:05:32] <g2nightmare> how do i get the file upon submit?
[14:05:34] <duch_kazatel> since that's your backend language.
[14:05:35] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: if thats the backend language you're using
[14:05:52] <saml> hello
[14:08:35] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[14:09:08] <g2nightmare> so i should use jsp to upload?
[14:09:20] <g2nightmare> or html takes care of it?
[14:09:43] <duch_kazatel> the thing I showed you is an extremely simple html form for file uploading.
[14:09:58] <duch_kazatel> the html has a control - your server will need to figure out what to do with that input.
[14:10:12] <g2nightmare> which thing?
[14:10:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/UCvVL/1/
[14:10:30] <g2nightmare> that's the jquery thing
[14:10:34] <duch_kazatel> the HTML.
[14:10:39] <g2nightmare> yeah i already have that though
[14:10:46] <g2nightmare> i tried the 'submit' option too
[14:10:55] <duch_kazatel> right - are you POSTing the file?
[14:11:43] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of tutorials out there on how to make a file uploader with java.
[14:11:56] <g2nightmare> none that worked
[14:12:06] <g2nightmare> for me at least
[14:12:18] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: handling a form upload is fairly basic stuff that you should know how to do on the backend
[14:12:40] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: i suppose you'd be using jsp if thats what you generally use on your backend?
[14:13:47] <g2nightmare> NoiseEee yeah i'd figure
[14:13:53] <g2nightmare> i don't really care how it works. as long as it works
[14:14:08] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you won't find a lot of sympathy in the programming world with that attitude, fwiw
[14:14:09] <g2nightmare> duch_kazatel: why does it tell me jquery is not defined but i import it using <script> and google's link?
[14:14:11] <g2nightmare> using your code
[14:14:42] <g2nightmare> NoiseEee: i would rather focus on the other stuff i have to do instead of trying to get this to work
[14:14:58] <duch_kazatel> g2nightmare that's probably because you're not waiting for doc ready.
[14:15:06] <duch_kazatel> and "i would rather focus on the other stuff" like what?
[14:15:44] <g2nightmare> i think it's working. page doesn't refresh though
[14:15:56] <g2nightmare> it logs in the console
[14:15:58] <duch_kazatel> right, because this code prevents the normal submit event...
[14:16:02] <g2nightmare> yeah
[14:16:09] <g2nightmare> but i need a way to get this data to java
[14:16:16] <g2nightmare> can you output js to jsp?
[14:16:24] <duch_kazatel> you have to POST it or GET it.
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> or any of the other verbs.
[14:16:35] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: why are you using jquery/javascript at all, out of interest?
[14:16:38] <duch_kazatel> you could do that with a plain html form or ajax?
[14:16:58] <g2nightmare> i would have loved to use a framework because it makes life easier
[14:17:08] <duch_kazatel> ^^ NoiseEee I'll bet because he wants something that "just works" - he sees something here that does something.
[14:17:17] <duch_kazatel> so he wants to take this and transform it into what he envisions.
[14:17:24] <g2nightmare> not necessarily
[14:17:30] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: but it seems like everything you're interested is server side
[14:17:33] <g2nightmare> i'm being forced to use jsp/js/java
[14:17:38] <g2nightmare> but i can't upload files
[14:17:39] <NoiseEee> "how to get to java"  "how to parse CSV"
[14:17:55] <NoiseEee> none of that requires JS/jquery
[14:17:58] <g2nightmare> i want to avoid uploading files because of the way this is going to be hosted
[14:18:12] <duch_kazatel> "i'm being forced to use jsp/js/java" - huh?  what exactly are you trying to do?
[14:18:14] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: that sounds kind of crazy.
[14:18:21] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: file uploading is basic, everyday stuff.
[14:18:30] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: jsp can do that
[14:18:48] <g2nightmare> it's complicated -- but my end goal is for teachers to upload some data, and then java runs some queries on the database
[14:18:57] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: then take JS out of it.
[14:18:59] <g2nightmare> and then populate some charts and figures
[14:19:06] <duch_kazatel> then post a file using html.  no javascript.
[14:19:25] <g2nightmare> ok -- then that can get me the data in java to parse?
[14:19:36] <duch_kazatel> a file upload via a post.
[14:19:49] <g2nightmare> is that temporary or does it actually store it on the server?
[14:19:53] <g2nightmare> i would rather just have temporary
[14:20:02] <hesco> I gave up, for the moment on writing js to handle a failure of the server-side data validation in favor of jquery.validate.js.  Have made significant progress these past two hours, but have hit a stopping point.  My code is at:  http://jsfiddle.net/KF425/  All seems to be working just fine until the cascading selectors start to fire.  As soon as I move the focus to the facility_type selector, I get a jquery.validate error on the facility
[14:20:04] <hesco> _state selector, even with valid data.  Can anyone please suggest to me where I might look next?
[14:20:10] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: google.  1) "how to handle form processing and uploads in jsp"  2) "how to parse a csv file with java"
[14:20:25] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: file uploads are temporarily stored on the server until the backend/script is complete
[14:20:34] <g2nightmare> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2422468/how-to-upload-files-to-server-using-jsp-servlet
[14:20:35] <g2nightmare> so this
[14:20:50] <daraand> Does anyone have a second? I'm getting stuck on some basic jQuery to change video sources
[14:20:57] <hesco> also, I found that with the client-side data validation in place, that a server-side data validation failure now fails to return the original data as it used to
[14:20:58] <andrewanderson> what's the go-to tag editor?
[14:21:33] <duch_kazatel> !ask daraand
[14:21:38] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ daraand
[14:21:38] <b-ot> daraand: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:21:54] <hesco> daraand:  pasting code seems to be a useful way to get help around here
[14:21:55] <daraand> *nod*
[14:22:11] <hesco> try jsfiddle.net, seems to be preferred on this channel
[14:22:18] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: looks good
[14:23:02] <daraand> !ask http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/gdZtF/1/  Hacked this together from other fiddles. This works in Chrome, does not work in Firefox because I need a video/ogg - well I've made one, but I just don't know how to change multiple sources with jQuery
[14:24:21] <daraand> So onMouseover, how can I change both the video/mp4 and video/ogg source?
[14:24:29] <g2nightmare> how do i check which version of servlet im using
[14:25:27] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: try #java
[14:25:41] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: your task is no longer suited to #jquery :)
[14:25:50] <g2nightmare> probably
[14:25:54] <g2nightmare> are we sure we can't use this way?
[14:25:58] <g2nightmare> it already logs what i need to the console
[14:26:17] <g2nightmare> document.write gives an Object object, but there's no way to unpack that
[14:26:18] <g2nightmare> ?
[14:27:13] <brunoais> Hey
[14:27:14] <brunoais> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15049
[14:27:17] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: doing things clientside is useless / provides no benefit because all you care about is doing things WITH your info, on the backend.
[14:27:19] <brunoais> how do I edit this?
[14:27:26] <brunoais> It is missing many breaklines
[14:27:31] <brunoais> any clues?
[14:27:40] <brunoais> I'm the ticket author
[14:28:44] <duch_kazatel> brunoais #jquery-dev might be more help?
[14:29:01] <brunoais> duch_kazatel, ok, thanks
[14:29:37] <duch_kazatel> g2nightmare yeah you want the java side of things, not the browser :)
[14:30:38] <daraand> Hmm
[14:31:01] <duch_kazatel> daraand so you want to know how to change attributes?
[14:31:48] <daraand> Well I wrote this: http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/gdZtF/1/ but the problem I'm having is I need to pass two different URLs, one that is video/mp4 and another that is a video/ogg
[14:32:06] <daraand> I use some jQuery to pass the data-source; what I don't know how to do is to pass multiple data-sources
[14:32:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?  there's one data-source per URL.  rephrase your question.
[14:33:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/gdZtF/5/ for better formatting btw
[14:33:23] <Bardamu> $("input").is(":focused") is when the mouse is on the input ?
[14:33:38] <duch_kazatel> :hover
[14:34:01] <Bardamu> because what I want to test is when the input is clicked once
[14:34:18] <Bardamu> like there is the input for typing something
[14:34:25] <daraand> oh gee I see: http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/gdZtF/7/ <- I added the extra source
[14:34:32] <daraand> I have two files, a .mp4 and a .ogv
[14:34:50] <daraand> I want to replace video's src with both of those
[14:34:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:35:00] <daraand> since a video can have multiple sources, for MIME
[14:35:06] <duch_kazatel> you want to replace a single video source with two sources?
[14:35:09] <saml> http://jsbin.com/wowodu/1/edit  is there a better way to do this?
[14:35:28] <daraand> Yeah; I know that doens't make sense, let me update fiddle and share 1 sec
[14:36:04] <duch_kazatel> saml what are you trying to do?
[14:36:23] <saml> hide matching elements. but show maximum 2 elements
[14:36:31] <saml> by hiding the rest
[14:36:35] <daraand> http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/gdZtF/8/
[14:36:39] <duch_kazatel> "hide matching elements" meaning...?  could you clarify a little more
[14:36:39] <duch_kazatel> ?
[14:36:53] <saml> hide elements where   pred(elem) is true
[14:36:59] <daraand> There e go duch_kazatel you'll see the video has two sources, one for MP4 and one for OGV
[14:37:23] <duch_kazatel> daraand so you want to modify the video/mp4 and the video/ogg sources.
[14:37:28] <daraand> correct!
[14:37:37] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery filter
[14:37:38] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .filter() | jQuery API Documentation ‚Üí http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:37:42] <duch_kazatel> saml check that sucker out.
[14:37:57] <saml> is filter good?
[14:38:07] <duch_kazatel> saml better that .each() for this case ;)
[14:38:40] <duch_kazatel> daraand really?  because you're almost there...
[14:38:46] <saml> so filter matching elements out. and  how do I split the array at certain index?
[14:39:08] <daraand> Oh boy
[14:39:15] <daraand> What am I missing D:
[14:39:16] <duch_kazatel> you mean get a certain number of things back?
[14:39:21] <saml> after filtering out, i still need to cut down remaining elements
[14:39:22] <decx> why change the src attribute when videos are in the source tag, and why on mouseover. i don'T get it
[14:39:47] <duch_kazatel> daraand then edit the source tags, not the video tag...
[14:40:39] <duch_kazatel> saml you mean get, say, the first two back?
[14:40:47] <saml> yes
[14:40:53] <duch_kazatel> .eq() is a thing.
[14:41:00] <saml> oh thanks
[14:41:18] <duch_kazatel> also: the jquery object is array-like.  there are tons of baked in array methods on it.
[14:41:39] <hesco> That is a never-mind on:  http://jsfiddle.net/KF425/ ; found my issue there, though I still wish I could return useful data when the server-side validation fails, but that is for another day.
[14:41:57] <saml> duch_kazatel, actually.. this is hard with filter
[14:42:11] <daraand> I'm not entirely sure how to do that, I tried this already: http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/gdZtF/9/ but it didn't work
[14:42:27] <saml> from elements, I need to filter some elements plus the rest of elements
[14:42:33] <saml> list.filter(...).hide()
[14:42:48] <duch_kazatel> saml lol that sentence makes no sense.
[14:42:59] <saml> list.filter(function() { return ....;}).hide()
[14:43:05] <saml> that condition is hard to write
[14:43:21] <duch_kazatel> saml shoot over your bin again.
[14:43:38] <saml> http://jsbin.com/wowodu/1/edit
[14:45:00] <duch_kazatel> so if the data-permalink is b, it should hide?
[14:48:42] <haleys> Any idea why this jquery google analytics code for jquery mobile works fine in Chrome, but not in Firefox/Safari? I‚Äôm not getting errors, it‚Äôs just not sending any events. The code goes into the if statements in firefox/safari though. http://pastie.org/private/hip1mr9ldmtnhvjrjkfw
[14:48:58] <g2nightmare> duch_kazatel: #java officially sucks
[14:49:00] <g2nightmare> completely unhelpful
[14:49:07] <duch_kazatel> why do you say that?
[14:49:17] <duch_kazatel> because we're not going to be of much help in here.
[14:49:37] <duch_kazatel> saml you could do this: http://jsfiddle.net/vW7ba/
[14:49:55] <duch_kazatel> saml and add in an extra condition checking the .eq()
[14:50:05] <g2nightmare> i know --
[14:52:47] <andrewanderson> dem DW/BI analystics
[14:52:58] <andrewanderson> giving nerds jobs
[14:53:34] <duch_kazatel> (document).on('pageshow', '[data-role=page], [data-role=dialog]', function (event, ui)
[14:53:37] <duch_kazatel> that is terrifying.
[14:53:40] <haleys> Anyone know? I‚Äôve been trying to figure this out for 2 days. Nothing is being sent in the http requests tab of the developer tools in Firefox/Safari, and not shown in Real Time google analytics. Works fine in Chrome (both the http request being sent to google, and the real time tracking showing up)
[14:54:11] <duch_kazatel> haleys what's a particular thing that's not working?
[14:54:15] <duch_kazatel> give me a line number
[14:55:02] <duch_kazatel> haleys because you've got some really mungy code here.  clicking on an a inside of .single-footer-menu is going to fire two "tracker"
[14:55:06] <duch_kazatel> *tracks
[14:55:14] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Basically all of the ga sends, but if we want to pick one off, line 30. Works fine in Chrome, but not FF/Safari. Not getting any console errors either. I can also console.log/alert inside that if statement in Firefox/Safari as well.
[14:55:45] <duch_kazatel> so you can reach that link it just doesn't seem to actually do anything?
[14:56:01] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Correct. Does something in Chrome, just not FF/Safari.
[14:56:11] <Horacsio> does anyone know this:https://github.com/lepixel/flippy
[14:56:44] <duch_kazatel> haleys so you're not seeing the image requests in the net panel?
[14:57:03] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Nope. I can see the image request in Chrome‚Äôs network tab, but not in Firebugs Net tab.
[14:57:04] <Horacsio> I mean this: https://github.com/lepixel/flippy
[14:57:26] <duch_kazatel> and you're not blocking cookies, right?
[14:57:53] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Correct. The login system to get to this page is also based off cookies, so you wouldn‚Äôt be able to access this w/o cookies working.
[14:58:52] <duch_kazatel> and you're not running ADP or anything like that?
[14:59:04] <duch_kazatel> err ABP
[14:59:45] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Nope. Has the same issue on multiple devices/computers. :(
[14:59:50] <Horacsio> can anyone help me with this: https://github.com/lepixel/flippy
[15:00:11] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Horascio
[15:00:11] <b-ot> Horascio: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:00:36] <duch_kazatel> haleys it sounds like you need to reach out to google then.  no idea why it doesn't work.
[15:00:50] <haleys> If I put alert('hello'); right after line 30, it alerts fine. It‚Äôs so weird that request is not being sent on line 30.
[15:01:03] <duch_kazatel> haleys right - which means that jquery is not your problem :)
[15:01:20] <duch_kazatel> i might try doing a console.log of the ga object to see if that's working as expected.
[15:01:58] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Good idea!
[15:01:58] <duch_kazatel> but otherwise we won't really be able to help you here.
[15:02:30] <YamakasY> do you guy minimize or scramble your jquery code ?
[15:02:34] <YamakasY> *guys
[15:02:37] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY we minimize it, yes.
[15:02:42] <duch_kazatel> scramble, no.
[15:02:48] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make sense to do.
[15:02:55] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: oh, btw, I got it fixed all :D
[15:03:05] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY huh?
[15:03:05] <YamakasY> okay
[15:03:13] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: I was here last night
[15:03:14] <duch_kazatel> oh i vaguely remember you from earlier.
[15:03:14] <daraand> duch_kazatel, I'm going in circles trying to figure this out, am I making a newbie mistake :D? You said I was close :d
[15:03:14] <haleys> duch_kazatel: After console.loging ga, it actually is telling me a lot. I see just function() in Firefox, while Chrome is showing function (a){J(1);Z.D[G](Z,[arguments])}
[15:03:28] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: what do you use to minimize it ?
[15:03:32] <duch_kazatel> haleys yeah, go hit up the google product forums.
[15:03:40] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY we use uglify here.
[15:03:55] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Cool. Thanks for giving me something else to think about!
[15:04:06] <YamakasY> duch_kazatel: it seems the best...
[15:05:42] <duch_kazatel> YamakasY that's one of them at least.
[15:07:27] <Horacsio> ok. where do I put the exemple https://github.com/lepixel/flippy ?
[15:07:34] <Horacsio> in a .js external file?
[15:07:42] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you mean to use it?
[15:08:00] <Horacsio> you see the exemple there in the github page?
[15:08:20] <duch_kazatel> yes.  you want to be able to use this?
[15:08:45] <Horacsio> yes
[15:08:56] <duch_kazatel> save this to your hard drive with the name ss.dyn.drei.com) has joined #jquery
[15:08:56] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:22:15:07:03] * ThinkingMan (~textual@c-174-49-198-11
[15:08:57] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[15:09:12] <duch_kazatel> save this to your hard drive with the name jquery.flippy.min.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lepixel/flippy/master/jquery.flippy.min.js
[15:09:34] <duch_kazatel> then reference that file using a script tag after jquery.
[15:09:43] <Horacsio> yes I know that :) but I need to use with my div‚Äôs right?
[15:09:57] <Horacsio> I‚Äôve already reached that
[15:09:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:10:20] <Horacsio> do you see the example there?
[15:10:33] <Horacsio> https://github.com/lepixel/flippy#example
[15:10:35] <duch_kazatel> uh, yeah...
[15:10:49] <Horacsio> that is meant to activate the plugin, right?
[15:11:01] <Horacsio> so, where do I insert that piece of code?
[15:11:11] <Horacsio> can I call it from an external .js file?
[15:11:12] <duch_kazatel> in your script file after you call jquery and flippy.
[15:11:22] <duch_kazatel> you SHOULD call it from an external file.
[15:11:40] <duch_kazatel> they all wind up in the browser sharing the same space, so the file doesn't really matter much.
[15:11:54] <Horacsio> <script src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/script/callingflippy.js"></script>
[15:11:59] <Horacsio> like this?
[15:12:05] <duch_kazatel> dunno about the php part, but sure.
[15:12:19] <daraand> http://jsfiddle.net/vfbFu/2/
[15:12:42] <duch_kazatel> $(.video: visible ) is invalid.
[15:12:43] <Horacsio> the php part is meant to address a wordpress theme folder :)
[15:13:44] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:15:47] <bowenac> having an issue trying to get an if checkboxes is checked unhide a submit button for checkboxes that are populated via ajax
[15:15:58] <daraand> ah damn, it invalid? ok let me hack around
[15:16:03] <bowenac> would that be because they are not in the dom
[15:16:17] <bowenac> it works in my jsfiddle
[15:16:52] <blindMoe> bowenac: use delelgation
[15:17:30] <blindMoe> something kind of like this: $('#parentElement').on('change', '.checkBoxElement', function() { $('.submitButton').show(); } );
[15:17:40] <decx> daraand http://jsfiddle.net/decx/gdZtF/12/
[15:17:49] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/fhQqJ/1/
[15:17:58] <bowenac> ill try that though
[15:18:19] <daraand> oh wow
[15:18:42] <decx> still had the tab open from earlier and fixed it up
[15:18:43] <decx> ^^
[15:18:48] <daraand> XD
[15:19:02] <daraand> I was trying a different method of hiding stuff, but, this seems to work on firefox (which was my biggest problem)
[15:19:49] <blindMoe> bowenac: http://jsfiddle.net/fhQqJ/2/
[15:20:29] <blindMoe> bowenac: try to format your html / css / script code nicely in jsfiddle so people can help you easier
[15:20:54] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe++
[15:23:38] <Horacsio> ok now I think I have the flippy applied: http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/ but something is not correctly working
[15:23:49] <Horacsio> can someone help me fixing this?
[15:24:33] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio let's poke.,
[15:24:43] <Horacsio> poke??
[15:24:46] <bowenac> yea sorry about that
[15:24:52] <bowenac> but that still isnt right but thanks anyway
[15:24:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking at it.
[15:25:13] <Horacsio> I need the FRONT div to flip into the BACK div
[15:25:39] <felixjet_> is .submit() prefered over .on('submit') ?
[15:25:51] <duch_kazatel> i prefer .on() personally.
[15:26:23] <felixjet_> i do too
[15:26:30] <felixjet_> more consistent with all other .on()
[15:26:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that's the wrong URL.
[15:26:42] <felixjet_> but maybe .submit() was a better practice xD
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> the event binding version of .submit() is an alias for .on('submit'
[15:27:17] <Horacsio> it is?
[15:27:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/2/
[15:27:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you were using this page for the fiddle: https://github.com/lepixel/flippy/blob/master/jquery.flippy.min.js
[15:27:49] <duch_kazatel> that's the wrong url for the external resource.
[15:28:46] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/3/ I think its now corrected
[15:29:07] <duch_kazatel> right - http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/4/
[15:29:10] <duch_kazatel> now with jquery included.
[15:29:15] <duch_kazatel> like i had before.
[15:30:32] <felixjet_> if i have a form, it is posibble to iterate every object inside?
[15:30:44] <Horacsio> ok now I need to flip the Front with the Back‚Ä¶
[15:30:50] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ yep
[15:30:53] <felixjet_> i mean, iterate every name="" element
[15:30:58] <felixjet_> inputs, textareas, etc
[15:31:03] <felixjet_> how i do that?
[15:31:06] <duch_kazatel> .each()
[15:31:12] <felixjet_> i can't do form.each()
[15:31:20] <duch_kazatel> $('input').each();
[15:31:28] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio huh?
[15:31:31] <felixjet_> but that iterate also the ones outside the form..
[15:31:39] <duch_kazatel> $('#myForm input')
[15:31:54] <felixjet_> u.u
[15:32:07] <felixjet_> but if i have a form instance, i can check anything inside the object?=
[15:32:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:32:27] <Horacsio> you see I have to divs, #oferta-front and #oferta-back under html. how do I flip #oferta-front with #oferta-back?
[15:32:30] <felixjet_> instead of specify  $('#myForm input, #myForm textarea, #myForm select')
[15:32:31] <felixjet_> etc
[15:32:46] <felixjet_> having var formData = $(this);
[15:32:54] <felixjet_> is not possible to read the elements inside formData ?
[15:33:00] <felixjet_> and not hardcoding it
[15:33:05] <duch_kazatel> $('#myForm').find('input, textarea, select');
[15:33:20] <felixjet_> thats still hardcoding man
[15:33:24] <felixjet_> you dont get my point i guess xD
[15:33:28] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it then.
[15:33:42] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you're wanting to enumerate over some mysterious combination of things.
[15:34:00] <felixjet_> something like  $('#myForm').childElements().each()
[15:34:14] <felixjet_> i mean, there must be a way to check the child elements of a form
[15:34:20] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/children/
[15:34:25] <felixjet_> just like when you do new FormData()
[15:34:34] <felixjet_> you dont specify input, textarea, etc
[15:34:40] <duch_kazatel> just linked it to you.
[15:34:42] <felixjet_> FormData already does it
[15:34:49] <duch_kazatel> .children()
[15:34:49] <felixjet_> not children
[15:34:58] <felixjet_> it will get labels and stuff
[15:35:00] <felixjet_> ...
[15:35:07] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/fhQqJ/3/
[15:35:11] <bowenac> anyone else?
[15:35:14] <duch_kazatel> right, so you need to specify the things you want to enumerate over.
[15:35:16] <bowenac> know why this wouldnt work
[15:35:30] <duch_kazatel> bowenac what doesn't work?
[15:35:34] <bowenac> it works in jsfiddle but not on my page the checkboxes are added to the page using ajax
[15:35:46] <bowenac> its not showing the submit button on my page like it should
[15:35:49] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/6/
[15:35:53] <duch_kazatel> bowenac you need to use event delegation.
[15:35:54] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, when you do new FormData you are not specifying them
[15:36:18] <felixjet_> and "this" a.k.a. the form, have properties and methods
[15:36:25] <bowenac> Well the code you shared to me, hides the button when you clicked a checkbox, and doesnt come back after unchecking a checkbox
[15:36:28] <felixjet_> there should be a property with a list of the components of the form
[15:36:57] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ i'm aware.  you asked "if i have a form, it is posibble to iterate every object inside?"  originally, so it's hard to know what you want.
[15:37:10] <duch_kazatel> bowenac huh?
[15:37:22] <felixjet_> but i added more info to my question
[15:37:32] <felixjet_> <felixjet_> i mean, iterate every name="" element
[15:37:33] <Justice> Hi I'm writing a website and trying to use swype (jquerymobile) Swypes work quite good on desktop however when I try on a mobile phone is really not working as I expected.
[15:37:39] <bowenac> nm that was blindmoe lol
[15:37:43] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ a fiddle would be amazing right now.  you can use attribute selectors, but those are slow.
[15:38:14] <Justice> Im testing on a Xperia Z with Android 4.3 and well sometimes the swype works and sometimes it dont (mostly the latter one)
[15:38:47] <Justice> Tried also the : http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/examples/swipe/swipe-page.html on my phone and it seems i experiance the same thing. Is there a way to fix this ?
[15:38:49] <duch_kazatel> something like $('form').find('*[name]') should work felixjet_ but be wary since that's slow.
[15:39:16] <duch_kazatel> bowenac so what are you trying to do?
[15:39:41] <duch_kazatel> just get the code to work when the checkboxes are ajax'd in?
[15:39:56] <bowenac> So on the page I have a search that uses ajax and returns results from the db. I have a checkbox that when you check I want to show a submit button at the bottom of the page
[15:40:16] <bowenac> So if any of the checkboxes in the form are checked show the submit button, if they are not hide the submit button
[15:40:25] <duch_kazatel> okay. and the checkboxes are ajax'd in?
[15:40:57] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, again... im not asking for find, children, etc :/
[15:41:26] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ ... $('form *[name]')
[15:41:28] <duch_kazatel> that could work?
[15:41:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand why you have the arbitrary limitations.
[15:41:40] <bowenac> but for some reason this http://jsfiddle.net/fhQqJ/4/ isn't working on server
[15:41:44] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be a stupid slow selector.
[15:42:00] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, why select something that i already selected?
[15:42:03] <bowenac> yea checkboxes everything from search results is loaded in success of ajax
[15:42:09] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ huh?
[15:42:18] <duch_kazatel> bowenac is #output ajax'd in as well?
[15:42:24] <bowenac> no
[15:42:28] <bowenac> its appended to output
[15:42:30] <duch_kazatel> then that code should work.
[15:42:30] <decx> *[name] is the same as [name], what's up with the * duch
[15:42:47] <duch_kazatel> decx i hardly ever touch attribute selectors like that.
[15:42:52] <duch_kazatel> forgot about that one.
[15:42:57] <duch_kazatel> but his requirements are weird.
[15:43:14] <decx> eh, it's ok if confined in context
[15:43:25] <duch_kazatel> but he doesn't want to "hardcode" anything.
[15:43:27] <duch_kazatel> just strange to me.
[15:45:03] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, if i already have $(this), selecting the form. why select $('form *[name]'), if i have already the elements inside $(this) in the form context
[15:45:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:45:29] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[15:45:37] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find() will do what you want.
[15:45:49] <duch_kazatel> i guess.
[15:45:55] <duch_kazatel> but without seeing code, i can't really help.
[15:48:22] <Horacsio> why div‚Äôs arent fliping? http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/8/
[15:48:32] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio define "flipping".
[15:48:51] <Horacsio> http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy//
[15:48:53] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you mean you wan both to flip?
[15:48:56] <duch_kazatel> *want
[15:49:07] <Horacsio> I want div A flips into div B
[15:49:14] <Horacsio> like in the demo
[15:49:15] <Horacsio> http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy//
[15:50:12] <Justice> nwm
[15:50:24] <Justice> Seems the swype issue is a google chrome browser bug in Android
[15:50:36] <Justice> Downloaded dolphin browser and swype works perfectly on the phone
[15:50:39] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio so inspect the code and check out the css and stuff.
[15:52:36] <Horacsio> I‚Äôve donne that but can figure it out
[15:52:46] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio http://guilhemmarty.com/flippy//demo.js there's the javascript.
[15:55:34] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio http://jsfiddle.net/Y5YaK/9/
[15:55:42] <duch_kazatel> that's basically where you start.
[15:55:45] <duch_kazatel> rtfm basically :)
[15:57:08] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/wAnk4/
[15:57:09] <felixjet_> see ?
[15:57:19] <felixjet_> why select something that has been already selected
[15:57:34] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ var form = $(this)[0]; wat
[15:57:48] <felixjet_> whats the problem?
[15:58:01] <felixjet_> it returns an array
[15:58:07] <felixjet_> the form is inside [0]
[15:58:14] <felixjet_> add a console.log to check it
[15:58:37] <duch_kazatel> right - you're trying to get the html node and not the jquery object?
[15:59:01] <felixjet_> no
[15:59:12] <decx> $(this)[0] is just this
[15:59:13] <duch_kazatel> because that's what that code does.
[15:59:46] <felixjet_> uh? no
[15:59:48] <duch_kazatel> i still don't understand why $(this).find() is such a problem.
[16:00:05] <felixjet_> form[0] is the way to access the properties
[16:00:27] <duch_kazatel> if you want the jquery object .get(0) is what you'd do.
[16:00:32] <felixjet_> http://new.tinygrab.com/febdb770651b247304c82497ef2151ce1d54089569.png
[16:01:05] <felixjet_> is not the same?
[16:01:21] <duch_kazatel> or is it .eq()?
[16:02:00] <felixjet_> meh, whatever
[16:02:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah it's .eq(), but the jquery object is array-like.  i feel like there's something very simple going on here that isn't "clicking" to me.  why is $(this).find() insufficient?
[16:02:34] <felixjet_> you can see, you dont need to use selectors
[16:02:39] <felixjet_> as you have already selected the form
[16:02:52] <felixjet_> and the child elements are inside the object
[16:03:24] <felixjet_> why .find() something that has been already found?
[16:03:26] <felixjet_> :/
[16:04:01] <duch_kazatel> all about however you want to work with it.  if you've all ready cached that data, find() isn't that bad.
[16:04:02] <duch_kazatel> you'
[16:04:11] <duch_kazatel> *you're acting like .find() is this awful slow thing.
[16:04:44] <felixjet_> nah, i'll end using .find, just wanted to see the alternative
[16:05:00] <felixjet_> retrieving the list from the form object
[16:05:15] <duch_kazatel> i mean, there are tons of options, but .find() isn't "finding what's all ready been found"
[16:05:52] <duch_kazatel> .find() is running through child elements of a given node.
[16:07:28] <felixjet_> well, thats a pure javascript alternative then :P
[16:07:38] <duch_kazatel> lol i guess.
[16:07:46] <d0de_> is it any faster to retrieve something stored in a simple var than in an object? like a string or a refence to a DOM element or something
[16:08:13] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ example?
[16:09:29] <decx> felixjet_ but you're already using .elements to go through the form what's the end goal if that's not enough?
[16:09:55] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/9JBuc/1/
[16:10:56] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ there will be an extremely miniscule, almost immeasurable difference between those two.
[16:11:11] <duch_kazatel> also, if you really care, it's $foo vs. myObject['bar'] vs $foo vs. myObject.bar
[16:11:44] <d0de_> it's for something that will run on mobile devices so I'm trying to find places to optimize, is this a silly one to worry about?
[16:12:14] <duch_kazatel> yes.  make sure shit is scoped and not global and you should be fine there.
[16:12:40] <decx> haven't noticed any difference when using object literal in a 60fps environment d0de_
[16:13:03] <decx> you can still cache stuff
[16:13:07] <d0de_> for the vars you mean, right? Because objects don't have scope, right? I'm currently replacing dozens of global vars with a few objects to try to make the code more maintainable
[16:13:20] <duch_kazatel> vars ARE objects.
[16:13:33] <decx> everything's an object
[16:13:42] <duch_kazatel> scope the object to the appropriate function.
[16:14:00] <felixjet_> an human is not an object
[16:14:14] <felixjet_> except in some contries
[16:14:33] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:14:43] <decx> var human = {} there
[16:14:54] <duch_kazatel> d0de http://jsfiddle.net/9JBuc/3/
[16:15:17] <decx> var var binks
[16:15:30] <duch_kazatel> derp
[16:15:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/9JBuc/4/
[16:15:41] <duch_kazatel> weee
[16:16:49] <d0de_> duch, I see, thanks. Is there a problem with using the global scope for things I need to use in lots of different places?
[16:17:27] <duch_kazatel> yes.  that can actually be slower (though that's becoming less and less of an issue) and makes your code hard to maintain.
[16:18:15] <duch_kazatel> avoid globals.
[16:19:06] <d0de_> But say I create something like a phonegap media element, which looks like: var myMedia = new Media('.foo.mp3'); if I need to control that element from lots of different points in the codebase, it needs to be globally scoped, right? or is that incorrect?
[16:19:06] <duch_kazatel> and if you're really in a case where you just need to have a few functions "share" an object and you don't want to pass it around, learn about IIFEs and how they might apply to that.
[16:19:46] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to pass that around as an argument, but see my previous comment.
[16:20:02] <d0de_> ok, will read up, thanks very much for the help
[16:20:14] <duch_kazatel> sure
[16:44:53] <bowenac> how can I check a checkbox if its ajax returned value is 1?
[16:45:08] <duch_kazatel> .prop('checked', true)
[16:45:19] <duch_kazatel> dunno what you mean by "if its ajax returned value is 1?"
[17:10:29] <felixjet_> it is ok to use "return false;" in a form on.submit to stop it?
[17:10:39] <felixjet_> for example, after validating, if fails, return false
[17:10:41] <duch_kazatel> use e.preventDefault(); instead.
[17:10:52] <felixjet_> but i have already preventdefault
[17:11:03] <duch_kazatel> that should stop it from submitting.
[17:11:10] <felixjet_> cause i don't submit it, i use an ajax request below
[17:11:20] <felixjet_> and i want to avoid it if validating fails
[17:11:25] <felixjet_> and if / else would be a mess
[17:11:52] <duch_kazatel> con
[17:12:01] <duch_kazatel> err http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[17:12:03] <duch_kazatel> there we goi.,
[17:13:39] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, https://ghostbin.com/paste/bgqwk
[17:13:42] <felixjet_> this is a real example
[17:13:50] <felixjet_> or if i have a better alternative..
[17:14:02] <felixjet_> yea i know return false is a bad choice here
[17:14:04] <felixjet_> thats why im asking
[17:14:18] <felixjet_> because having to create an error variable sounds a little weird too
[17:14:51] <felixjet_> maybe stoppropagation ?
[17:14:55] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:14:58] <felixjet_> i don't know tbh
[17:15:00] <duch_kazatel> e.preventDefault() and e.stopImmediatePropagation() are the right choices.  not sure what you're trying to do here.
[17:15:13] <duch_kazatel> you're stopping form submission, validating, and then posting it using ajax.
[17:15:18] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, https://ghostbin.com/paste/bgqwk
[17:15:27] <duch_kazatel> all ready looking at it yo.
[17:15:29] <duch_kazatel> nothing special.
[17:15:45] <felixjet_> i mean, if the bottom one is bad choice because of return false
[17:15:53] <felixjet_> should i use the first one? or i do have a better alternative?
[17:16:00] <felixjet_> maybe stoppropagation?
[17:16:12] <duch_kazatel> stoppropagation has nothjing to do with this.
[17:16:18] <duch_kazatel> the first one is on the right path
[17:16:49] <felixjet_> having to create a variable just to populate if error sounds crappy :(
[17:17:07] <duch_kazatel> i might abstract out the "valid" logic so all I'm doing in my handler is saying "if (formIsValid()){}"
[17:18:02] <duch_kazatel> e.stopPropagation() has to do with the way events bubbl;e
[17:18:57] <felixjet_> yea, it's a concept i don't fully understand even after reading a lot, the bubble thing >.<
[17:18:59] <felixjet_> thanks
[17:19:04] <duch_kazatel> oh, that's easy.
[17:19:14] <pcfreak30> How can I get a splitbutton and a element with class ui-li-aside to cooperate without the button going on a new line
[17:19:18] <fission6> how can i force a POST request when a link is requested for a page (not ajax)
[17:19:23] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ pcfreak30
[17:19:23] <b-ot> pcfreak30: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:19:29] <fission6> (i need to change the language of the page which is done through a POST)
[17:19:40] <duch_kazatel> fission6 so you want to post without using ajax?
[17:19:41] <fission6> sorry when a link is clicked
[17:19:44] <fission6> yes duch_kazatel
[17:19:49] <felixjet_> fission6, you can't.
[17:19:51] <duch_kazatel> okay, can the page relaod like normal?
[17:19:52] <fission6> must i emulate a form submission
[17:19:58] <fission6> duch_kazatel: yes
[17:20:03] <duch_kazatel> then submit a form.
[17:20:07] <fission6> i think i need to emulate a form submission
[17:20:09] <fission6> dah ok
[17:20:27] <jaequery> it seems to me, a chrome extension has potential to view ALL your cookies ... how is this even allowed? i'd imagine this to be a major security flaw
[17:20:47] <felixjet_> you can submit() on click the link
[17:20:54] <snover> it‚Äôs allowed by you clicking the ‚Äúi allow this‚Äù when you install the extension.
[17:21:04] <snover> if you don‚Äôt like it, click ‚Äúcancel‚Äù.
[17:21:14] <felixjet_> or you can also, which is more complicated, let the server handle a method override and pass something like ?method=post in url
[17:22:31] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:22:39] <duch_kazatel> either way, felixjet_ http://jsfiddle.net/4G9GK/1/
[17:22:42] <duch_kazatel> see this?
[17:23:13] <felixjet_> yes
[17:23:20] <DHowett> felixjet_: interesting! you use ghostbin
[17:23:27] <felixjet_> DHowett, why? :P
[17:23:33] <felixjet_> it's yours? xD
[17:23:36] <DHowett> yeah!
[17:23:39] <felixjet_> lol!
[17:23:41] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ so any time you click on something in the document, that particular element gets noisy about it.
[17:23:43] <DHowett> I'm always surprised to see it cropping up in places ;p
[17:23:52] <felixjet_> it's my prefered pastebin atm
[17:23:55] <DHowett> sweet
[17:24:12] <DHowett> Time for one of those "Valued Customer" surveys: Where'd you hear about it?
[17:24:16] <DHowett> Mostly kidding, but I'm interested!
[17:24:25] <felixjet_> but i miss a better indentation handle
[17:24:29] <felixjet_> xD
[17:24:29] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ that element has the event on it, but then the event "bubbles up" through the tree.
[17:24:38] <DHowett> yeah, the indentation could be better ;P
[17:24:40] <felixjet_> DHowett, on #laravel channel someone used it months ago
[17:24:44] <DHowett> neat. thanks!
[17:25:55] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, oh right. like having a click event in link and also the parent div, right? clicking in link also activates the div event
[17:26:02] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[17:26:09] <duch_kazatel> it "bubbles up"
[17:26:11] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple.
[17:26:18] <felixjet_> so stop propagation stops the events on parents?
[17:26:22] <felixjet_> damn, pretty easy xD
[17:26:35] <duch_kazatel> it stops the event from propagating any further up the tree.
[17:27:58] <felixjet_> DHowett, the main problem with indentation is that if you press tab, there is like 8 spaces xD
[17:28:01] <felixjet_> too much width
[17:28:19] <felixjet_> having 4 levels of indentation makes the code too unreadable
[17:28:27] <DHowett> that's fair; right now it's left up to the UA, but I should make it configurable
[17:28:38] <felixjet_> i have to go sublime, fix indentation and paste again xd
[17:28:46] <DHowett> want to log an issue at the shell repo? github.com/DHowett/ghostbin (the code will be there eventually)
[17:28:57] <DHowett> (incidentally, ghostbin is the reason for me hanging out in #jquery :P)
[17:29:09] <felixjet_> sure
[17:29:13] <DHowett> thanks :D
[17:29:21] <felixjet_> ill star it so i can remember
[17:30:03] <duch_kazatel> lol jaequery is over in #javascript getting their mind blown.
[17:31:13] <felixjet_> duch_kazatel, http://www.endurasoft.com/Blog/post/X-HTTP-Method-Override.aspx
[17:32:22] <felixjet_> this way you can submit a form and use PUT, DELETE, etc, no only GET/POST
[17:32:29] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ okay?  i know forms only allow get/post...
[17:33:00] <felixjet_> oh ok. i said because of this
[17:33:05] <felixjet_> <felixjet_> or you can also, which is more complicated, let the server handle a method override and pass something like ?method=post in url <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:33:48] <duch_kazatel> that is not what the article suggests, but the question was specifically asking about POSTing a value.
[17:34:09] <duch_kazatel> not sure why you were suggesting with munging together a GET url to "pretend" we're running a post.
[17:35:47] <felixjet_> yea well, not the best for that case
[17:36:02] <duch_kazatel> they just wanted to know about their options re: a POST
[17:36:06] <felixjet_> it was just an alternative, i also agreed that he can use the link to submit()
[17:37:17] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand why you're suggesting an alternative when it was entirely unnecessary :P that's why i'm confused.
[17:38:30] <felixjet_> well, what do you expect from someone that just learned what bubbling means XD
[17:38:44] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[17:38:45] <felixjet_> nah, i like know the alternatives, so i can choose the better one
[17:39:20] <duch_kazatel> and that's fine, but none of these alternatives were really useful in this case.
[17:39:27] <felixjet_> maybe he needs to simulate PUT or DELETE some day
[17:39:30] <felixjet_> :p
[17:39:46] <BillCriswell> "Open Source Developer"... What the hell is that?
[17:39:54] <duch_kazatel> oh god.
[17:40:00] <felixjet_> BillCriswell, someone that codes for free?
[17:40:02] <felixjet_> hah
[17:40:07] <duch_kazatel> they develop - only in open source.
[17:40:19] <BillCriswell> Oh, I am that.
[17:40:20] <duch_kazatel> maybe they mean "Open Sores Developer"
[17:40:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Sounds painful.
[17:40:28] <__joshua__> zing
[17:40:46] <duch_kazatel> somebody get them to a hospital - quick!
[17:41:07] <felixjet_> "developer opens source" and starts copypasting
[17:41:38] <bowenac> anyone know how to check if json return value is null?
[17:41:49] <Velveeta> "comet trails on the mouse cursor?! awesome!" <view -> page source -> copy/paste> "i'm a web developer!"
[17:41:53] <__joshua__> value===null
[17:41:58] <bowenac> I tried item.id == null
[17:42:17] <Velveeta> bowenac: that's different than the json return value being null
[17:42:22] <felixjet_> use ===
[17:42:28] <BillCriswell> The only thing that gets my attention in a recruiter email is salary.. I think I'm a sell out.
[17:42:30] <Velveeta> the return value being null implies the whole thing is null vs one property of it
[17:42:45] <Velveeta> billcriswell: do you ever get recruiter emails with salaries posted?
[17:42:46] <__joshua__> $.ajax(url).then(function(data){ if(data===null){....
[17:42:51] <bowenac> hmmm still not working with === but I get it in the console TypeError: json is null
[17:43:16] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Just got one, but asking for a "Open Source Developer" makes me nervous.
[17:43:30] <BillCriswell> So I'm only taking it 10% seriously as opposed to like... 3%.
[17:43:37] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:43:38] <duch_kazatel> genius.
[17:43:44] <Velveeta> "bowenac: anyone know how to check if json return value is null?" ... "bowenac: hmmm still not working with === but I get it in the console TypeError: json is null"
[17:43:46] <duch_kazatel> "percentage of serious"
[17:44:05] <Velveeta> i think i know how to check if the json return value is null.... if the error tells you explicitly that it's null, it's null...
[17:44:06] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/8Qf6V6a.gif
[17:44:16] <bowenac> yes I know it is null
[17:44:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I use that scale too often.
[17:44:25] <bowenac> I am specifically searching for something I know will be null
[17:44:34] <bowenac> but I want to alert something if it comes back as null
[17:44:40] <duch_kazatel> if (data === null && data.id === null)
[17:44:48] <duch_kazatel> you have to check each level.
[17:44:49] <Velveeta> well, ideally, a json response from the server should never be null
[17:45:04] <__joshua__> yeah, an empty object perhaps
[17:45:07] <Velveeta> if you want to signify no data, you should return an empty record set, or an error message or something stating as such
[17:45:13] <duch_kazatel> can't just be all "if (data.thing.butts.ass.ass.ass.ass.id.anotherbutt.ninjas.astringiguess)
[17:45:17] <xniz> bleeeh Im having problems with centering my div appropriately
[17:45:26] <duch_kazatel> xniz margin: 0 auto;
[17:45:27] <duch_kazatel> yw
[17:45:28] <duch_kazatel> !next
[17:45:32] <Velveeta> lol
[17:45:35] <xniz> duch_kazatel, no not that easy
[17:45:39] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:45:46] <bowenac> nothing
[17:45:46] <xniz> you will see... one moment :P
[17:45:51] <Velveeta> <br/><br/><br/><br/><div>fixed!</div>
[17:45:58] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta ftw
[17:46:07] <felixjet_> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok
[17:46:10] <bowenac> var item = json[i]; if (item === null && item.id === null) {alert("No ID Found");}
[17:46:28] <__joshua__> no
[17:46:29] <Velveeta> bowenac: if item === null, then item.id won't exist
[17:46:37] <__joshua__> var item = json[i]; if (item === null || item.id === null) {alert("No ID Found");}
[17:46:40] <Velveeta> but your error is stating that json itself is null
[17:47:01] <felixjet_> you should check if json[i] exists
[17:47:02] <xniz> you would have to see what im working on to understand what i am doing :P
[17:47:02] <felixjet_> not item
[17:47:13] <felixjet_> because if json[i] is null
[17:47:16] <__joshua__> he needs to check if 'json' is not null
[17:47:18] <__joshua__> right
[17:47:19] <felixjet_> doing var item = json[1] will give u error
[17:47:21] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/
[17:47:46] <bowenac> I am just trying to find out if the return value was not found in the db
[17:47:50] <xniz> basically, when the window is resized, it calculates how many thumbnails can be viewed within the window's width, hides the thumbnails accordingly
[17:47:53] <felixjet_> also why are you copying json into item? just check json
[17:48:02] <xniz> as you resize the width of the page, more thumbnails appear.
[17:48:03] <bowenac> so if someone searches for an id of 1020 and it doesnt exist in the db and it returns null
[17:48:14] <__joshua__> yeah, so check if the result is null
[17:48:16] <bowenac>  	                        var id = json[0];//get id 	                        var employee = json[1];//get employee 	                        var date = json[2];//get employee 	                        var companyName = json[3];//get company 	                        var notes = json[4];//get company 	                        var companyPhone = json[5];//get company 	                        var contact = json[6];//get company 	          
[17:48:19] <bowenac> oooops
[17:48:20] <bowenac> lol
[17:48:20] <felixjet_> holy shit
[17:48:21] <xniz> the only way i can get perfect centering of the thumbnails are when the window is max width, or only 1 thumbnail is showing
[17:48:22] <Velveeta> whoa whoa whoa
[17:48:23] <bowenac> but I am doing it like that
[17:48:27] <felixjet_> one pastebin dead
[17:48:31] <xniz> my algorithm seems to be sketchy when its in between
[17:48:36] <Velveeta> i'm not even gonna try to read through that
[17:48:41] <duch_kazatel> xniz you got some real interesting sizing on those lis btw
[17:48:48] <xniz> indeed
[17:48:51] <duch_kazatel> and margins.
[17:49:03] <xniz> yes complicated really
[17:49:07] <bowenac> I am copying it because I am appending items using ajax
[17:49:26] <bowenac> so then for each appended item I use item.id, etc
[17:49:29] <duch_kazatel> xniz... "complicated"?  you have negative margins going on here because...
[17:49:40] <xniz> duch_kazatel, positioning purposes
[17:49:47] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[17:49:51] <duch_kazatel> negative margins are funky.
[17:49:57] <xniz> yeah well ill show u without it
[17:49:57] <duch_kazatel> and not in the "george clinton" way.
[17:50:01] <__joshua__> people use to use negative margins for centering
[17:50:12] <__joshua__> used*.  dunno if its still the done thing
[17:50:14] <duch_kazatel> take a look at their site, you'll see why i'm like "wut"
[17:50:18] <felixjet_> i never used negative margins
[17:50:25] <xniz> refresh the page now
[17:50:32] <felixjet_> because some day, they will want payback
[17:50:33] <xniz> this is without negative margins
[17:50:34] <duch_kazatel> xniz i can turn those off myself.
[17:50:35] <xniz> too much spacing
[17:50:41] <Velveeta> right, so shrink the margin
[17:50:45] <Velveeta> don't use negative margin
[17:50:50] <xniz> shrink?
[17:50:51] <Velveeta> cut that in half
[17:51:04] <bowenac> ok so no one gets what I am trying to do then?
[17:51:13] <xniz> without the margin at -80 theres wayy to much spacing in there
[17:51:18] <felixjet_> bowenac, we already gave you the solution
[17:51:24] <duch_kazatel> xniz right - reduce the widths on the LI.
[17:51:24] <Velveeta> bowenac: can you put together a code sample on jsbin or fiddle or at the very least, pastebin?
[17:51:29] <felixjet_> again: check json variable for null
[17:51:46] <xniz> duch_kazatel, ok will try that and hopefully it doesnt clip the image
[17:51:51] <xniz> one moment, thank you
[17:51:56] <bowenac> that doesnt work felixjet
[17:52:04] <felixjet_> what doesn't works?
[17:52:25] <felixjet_> afaik, the last time i checked if a value is null, it worked :P
[17:52:27] <xniz> ah yes, as expected the shadows do not show properly when cliped
[17:52:43] <duch_kazatel> xniz right, because you're doing this all wrong.
[17:53:05] <Velveeta> xniz: why do you have the gradient in the background of both the ul and each li?
[17:53:07] <xniz> duch_kazatel, im just exporting my thumbnail background from photoshop. im assuming I should use CSS for the shadows
[17:53:09] <__joshua__> haha bowenac.  just check if json is null
[17:53:11] <bowenac> you obviously have no idea what I am doing felixjet
[17:53:27] <xniz> the gradient expands all the way across the page... that is how i want it
[17:53:30] <bowenac> I have
[17:53:31] <xniz> the gradient is not the problem
[17:53:31] <Velveeta> bowenac: that's why we're asking to see the code
[17:53:35] <bowenac> like 20 different ways
[17:53:36] <__joshua__> Im not convinced that you know what you are doing,  bowenac
[17:53:38] <bowenac> and every way you guys have showed
[17:53:41] <bowenac> it never alerts
[17:53:48] <Velveeta> xniz: no, what i'm saying is, why not have the gradient just on the ul, and not on the li's
[17:53:50] <duch_kazatel> did bowenac fiddle up his code?
[17:53:51] <__joshua__> you are NOT checking if json is null
[17:53:55] <Velveeta> it's redundant to do it to both
[17:53:56] <bowenac> but always shows null in console I know it is null but I cant get it to alert anything haha
[17:54:16] <xniz> the green gradient is in the "#middle" id
[17:54:34] <felixjet_> bowenac, again, pastebin it?
[17:54:42] <felixjet_> how im going to have an idea of what are you doing then? :D
[17:54:45] <duch_kazatel> why isn't the full-width gradient a background on the UL?
[17:55:11] <xniz> because... the gradient is in its own div, that is how i prefered to do the design
[17:55:18] <xniz> then on top i load the thumbnails
[17:55:28] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.  the UL should be the container for all that.
[17:55:41] <duch_kazatel> and the LIs each have that background on them.
[17:55:54] <xniz> dude what the hell are you talking about/.
[17:55:59] <xniz> the gradient is the main container
[17:56:03] <xniz> for the <ul>
[17:56:06] <felixjet_> this channel turned out into #css :D (not complaining, its a joke xD)
[17:56:12] <xniz> the gradient has nothing to do with my problem im having
[17:56:25] <xniz> the gradient is fine. the box and the shadow is what my problem is
[17:56:26] <duch_kazatel> xniz just pointing out some things you could do to make this a lot easier.
[17:56:33] <Velveeta> felixjet_: yeah, i was kind of curious about how this qualified as a jquery question early on :D
[17:56:33] <xniz> easier...
[17:56:35] <xniz> lets see
[17:56:46] <xniz> i have #middle { background: url('images/middle.png') }
[17:56:50] <felixjet_> Velveeta, .css('background') . problem? xD
[17:56:50] <xniz> how easier can it get?
[17:56:56] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/6MavWXGB
[17:57:09] <__joshua__> right
[17:57:16] <__joshua__> first line in success:  if(json){
[17:57:20] <xniz> im focusing on the <ul> and <li> not the gradient, forget the green gradient
[17:57:22] <Velveeta> bowenac: oh, look at that, you're not checking to see if json === null... just like we've said a dozen times now
[17:57:29] <__joshua__> again and again
[17:57:44] <bowenac> yea I said I did again and again
[17:57:48] <bowenac> and it doesnt do anything
[17:57:53] <__joshua__> you didn't
[17:57:54] <xniz> i mean i appreciate the advice, but the gradient is not my problem
[17:57:55] <bowenac> but you missed that part aparently
[17:58:09] <felixjet_> dude, you missed the part 4 years ago
[17:58:15] <felixjet_> you are checking if json exists in line 20
[17:58:16] <Velveeta> xniz: your li background image should be trimmed to be flush with the left and right edges of its box
[17:58:20] <felixjet_> and using json variable in line 4+
[17:58:22] <felixjet_> wtf.
[17:58:31] <__joshua__> bowenac: it will error well before there
[17:58:32] <Velveeta> then you wouldn't have to use weird negative margin to do things
[17:58:35] <felixjet_> you have to check if BEFORE using it
[17:58:42] <felixjet_> how are you going to use something that doesn't exist?
[17:58:57] <xniz> Velveeta,  agreed, but have you inspected the Slideshow_Thumb2.png?
[17:59:09] <xniz> Velveeta,  that has my shadows built in so i dont have to use css shadow
[17:59:18] <xniz> if i clip the .png, no more shadows, and it makes everything funky
[17:59:34] <xniz> hence why i used the negative margin for positioning purposes.
[17:59:53] <Velveeta> xniz: do you need the shadow to take up that full left and right space? it looks like it only extends maybe 10-15px off to each side
[17:59:54] <bowenac> ok so where do I need to check it at
[17:59:58] <bowenac> it doesnt hit the error
[18:00:01] <bowenac> so obviously cant check there
[18:00:02] <Velveeta> but you have like an extra 40px or so on each side
[18:00:08] <bowenac> I tried right after the success with no luck
[18:00:15] <Velveeta> bowenac: the first line of your success function
[18:00:23] <xniz> Velveeta, i can try and trim it down. one moment. maybe i can make it a bit better
[18:01:25] <duch_kazatel> xniz i just refactored your css to remove the negative margins and shit.
[18:01:40] <xniz> yeah, that is fine i am working on it now
[18:01:42] <bowenac> ok now its working thanks Velveeta I think I was using == when I tried it on the first line
[18:01:44] <bowenac> thanks
[18:01:49] <felixjet_> it is valid to use else {}; ?
[18:01:52] <felixjet_> or just too unnecesary?
[18:02:02] <duch_kazatel> unnecessary imo.
[18:02:09] <Velveeta> bowenac: yeah, you should be using !==, http://pastebin.com/YTGR2Xzb
[18:02:29] <Velveeta> felixjet_: it's valid, and also unnecessary
[18:02:47] <xniz> yikes... that didnt work
[18:04:00] <xniz> ok, well how about negative relative positioning? is that bad practice?
[18:04:15] <duch_kazatel> yes
[18:04:16] <duch_kazatel> brb
[18:04:44] <__joshua__> when you use negative relative positioning you are hacking around a bigger problem, usually
[18:04:50] <Velveeta> best practice is to figure out how to make it work with its natural document flow, otherwise you open all kinds of doors to browser quirks
[18:05:34] <bowenac> Velveeta thanks I updated it to use that
[18:05:35] <xniz> well what i had before seemed to work fine
[18:05:36] <bowenac> thanks again
[18:05:48] <Velveeta> no problem
[18:06:03] <Velveeta> xniz: seemed to work fine only in certain cases, right?
[18:06:12] <Velveeta> that's what you said when you came in here looking for help..
[18:06:26] <xniz> i never said it had anything to do with the margin though
[18:06:39] <xniz> its my positioning algorithm
[18:07:01] <Velveeta> right, what we're saying is that anytime you start doing weird positioning, you open yourself up to these kinds of positioning quirks
[18:07:10] <duch_kazatel> back
[18:07:11] <Velveeta> it's best to figure out how to make it work with the natural document flow
[18:07:41] <felixjet_> it is ok to use <form method="DELETE"> ?
[18:07:44] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta is spot on imo.
[18:08:16] <felixjet_> i know is not supported, but that way i can use in my $.ajax() request "type: form.attr('method')"
[18:08:35] <Velveeta> felixjet_: for something like that, maybe you should go with a data-method kind of attribute
[18:09:21] <felixjet_> but... then what i do place inside method="" ?
[18:09:21] <xniz> oh well.. ill figure it out myself
[18:09:30] <felixjet_> or i avoid it and let the GET default stay there?
[18:09:49] <felixjet_> it's not used anyway since the form is never submited
[18:10:05] <felixjet_> but can look confusing if i have method="GET" data-method="DELETE"
[18:10:07] <Velveeta> felixjet_: the method attribute is optional
[18:10:09] <duch_kazatel> xniz i spent a few minutes in firebug and was able to clean up your positioning rules.  shouldn't be too hard.
[18:10:15] <Velveeta> just omit it altogether
[18:10:22] <felixjet_> kk
[18:10:22] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  did u even see the problem i was talking about?
[18:10:25] <duch_kazatel> xniz and then check out this article: http://www.heydonworks.com/article/tetris-the-power-of-css
[18:10:28] <felixjet_> thx
[18:10:40] <felixjet_> probably it wont validate HTML anyway, using method="DELETE"
[18:10:41] <duch_kazatel> xniz yes, i did.  to resolve your problem, you must first un-break your CSS.
[18:10:58] <duch_kazatel> and then you can better address your centering algorithm.
[18:11:52] <felixjet_> Velveeta, just as an opinion, if a form is POST, would you mantain dada-method="POST" for consistency? or in that cause, use method="POST" and use .attr() inside $.ajax() ?
[18:11:59] <xniz> yeah well i dont really know how an alternative to the -80px margin
[18:12:07] <felixjet_> s/cause/case
[18:12:21] <xniz> not without screwing up the actual shadows and image itself
[18:12:27] <Velveeta> felixjet_: if your form is always gonna be submitted via ajax, i'd just keep it consistent w/ the data-method attribute
[18:12:32] <duch_kazatel> one sec and i'll step you through it.
[18:12:43] <xniz> Thank you
[18:12:58] <felixjet_> kk, will do then :p
[18:12:59] <xniz> I am sorry if I am being pesky or arrogant, but I've been workin on this sh*t for 2 hours
[18:13:15] <duch_kazatel> i've had a really fucking terrible day personally, so meh.
[18:13:18] <xniz> the showing/hiding of the elements are fine, the animation is fine, its just the centering
[18:13:37] <xniz> cant seem to get it to be exactly centered.. works fine with just 1 active thumbnail and perfect when all are visible
[18:14:34] <duch_kazatel> remove margin-right on #thumbnails li
[18:14:36] <duch_kazatel> on #thumbnails img, remove margin-right and margin-top and set top to 39px
[18:14:45] <xniz> ok
[18:14:46] <duch_kazatel> starts there.
[18:15:07] <duch_kazatel> now you're not using negative margins to position thingds.
[18:15:09] <duch_kazatel> *things
[18:16:12] <xniz> ok
[18:16:17] <xniz> this is what i have now with what u just told me
[18:16:18] <xniz> one sec
[18:16:33] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/
[18:16:51] <duch_kazatel> you didn't remove margin-top on #thumbnails img
[18:16:55] <mikeche1en> how do i get jqm 1.4.1 on jsfiddle?
[18:16:59] <xniz> oh one sec
[18:17:09] <duch_kazatel> and then you need to set top to 39px
[18:17:12] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome.
[18:17:30] <duch_kazatel> actually top should b e38px
[18:17:35] <duch_kazatel> *be 38px
[18:17:44] <xniz> ok
[18:18:20] <xniz> duch_kazatel,  that is fine thank you, but now i need to remove the large spacing between each thumbnail
[18:18:29] <xniz> idk how to do that without some sort of negative value
[18:18:33] <Velveeta> mikeche1en: you can add a link directly to the src of it via the external resources
[18:19:02] <xniz> if i clip the image.. it just looks funky
[18:19:10] <xniz> unless...
[18:19:22] <duch_kazatel> xniz why aren't you using CSS3 gradients and border-radius?
[18:19:34] <felixjet_> xniz, why don't you just set the div with overflow: hidden, and apply a negative margin to the left based on the difference of the (div width - viewport width) / 2 ?
[18:19:42] <duch_kazatel> xniz also, use display: none; on those <li>s and center the UL using margin: 0 auto;
[18:20:01] <felixjet_> thats what you want toe, dont?
[18:20:06] <felixjet_> to get*
[18:20:25] <duch_kazatel> felixjet_ the acutal solution doesn't require that sort of calculation
[18:20:47] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: i tried that but for some reason its not working http://jsfiddle.net/Wak2k/2/
[18:21:03] <xniz> and ill check into css gradients.
[18:21:06] <xniz> for the background
[18:21:10] <Velveeta> mikeche1en: that's jquery mobile, not jquery
[18:21:13] <xniz> the only thing i can think of
[18:21:22] <Velveeta> if you're trying to get jquery mobile on there, you need to add jquery also, it builds on top of that
[18:21:27] <xniz> instead of using an image for the background, use a white box with css shadows
[18:21:41] <xniz> one monet
[18:21:45] <xniz> ill try that
[18:22:00] <duch_kazatel> i have to go home and get drunk and be depressed now.  enjoy your evening everybody!
[18:22:06] <Velveeta> xniz: what browsers do you have to support for this site?
[18:22:22] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: thats what im trying to get working, jquery mobile 1.4.1
[18:22:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Where have you been? Haven't seen you in a while.
[18:22:50] <xniz> Velveeta,  hadnt thought about that... IE, firefox, chrome, and android/ios devics
[18:22:55] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: i found the problem it needs the .css as well
[18:23:03] <Velveeta> ahhhh yes, there you go
[18:23:27] <Velveeta> billcriswell: busy busy man.. they have me hopping around to different product teams to force an upgrade of my product on their product
[18:23:39] <Velveeta> and other assorted excuses
[18:23:51] <BillCriswell> Sounds interesting.
[18:24:23] <Velveeta> it's really a lot less than it sounds :D
[18:24:33] <Velveeta> i'd rather be doing feature work on my own stuff
[18:25:44] <BillCriswell> Haha don't blame you
[18:29:55] <felixjet_> developers are not developers anymore, they (*we*) are librarians
[18:30:03] <felixjet_> 10 hours reading 1 hour coding
[18:30:33] <ryanneufeld> felixjet_: i think you need to adjust your definition of developer
[18:30:49] <felixjet_> web developer
[18:30:51] <ryanneufeld> how else would you learn how to write the code?
[18:31:15] <felixjet_> yea but years ago it was easy to handle
[18:31:17] <mikeche1en> anyone know the preferred way to get rid of link underline when using JQM 1.4 button()? http://jsfiddle.net/cZV22/1/
[18:31:27] <felixjet_> now as soon as you learn a framework, templating engine, library, etc
[18:31:32] <felixjet_> 40 new ones and better appear
[18:31:46] <felixjet_> it's impossible to read that much xD
[18:32:12] <Velveeta> well, nobody is expected to know all of them... learning patterns is better than learning particular frameworks
[18:32:31] <Velveeta> and they all tend to use different ones to implement what they do, and/or as the core of what they're built on top of
[18:33:21] <felixjet_> still you have to learn the framework to use it
[18:33:30] <felixjet_> patterns are just the base
[18:33:36] <Velveeta> right, but most people don't use N different frameworks
[18:33:42] <xniz> hmm well its def getting better with the change
[18:33:55] <Velveeta> they learn enough about one to know the right circumstances to use it, and they usually stick to a handful that they prefer
[18:33:57] <felixjet_> well not talking about 30 frameworks at all
[18:33:58] <felixjet_> but tools
[18:34:16] <Velveeta> but the short answer is yes, there's a lot of reading involved
[18:34:40] <felixjet_> scss, grunt, templating engine, sockets, blah blah
[18:34:51] <Velveeta> yup
[18:34:59] <felixjet_> even bootstrap (for ones that use it)
[18:35:01] <__joshua__> Im finding jumping between backbone and angular a bit mentally taxing, but its good practice
[18:35:17] <felixjet_> and yea, backbone/angular too
[18:35:18] <felixjet_> xD
[18:36:36] <felixjet_> and much more in nodejs enviroment, where you don't code at all, you just read libraries apis
[18:37:27] <Velveeta> yes, complexity through composition, what a beautiful thing :)
[18:38:05] <heedly> How would I get the name of a selected option?
[18:38:18] <felixjet_> it is
[18:38:27] <Velveeta> name as in, the text that's displayed?
[18:38:47] <felixjet_> heedly, $('input:selected').attr('name')
[18:38:48] <andrewanderson> hey guys, by javascript convention.. what does "on change" mean?
[18:38:49] <felixjet_> or something like that
[18:39:00] <felixjet_> but .attr('name') is what you need
[18:39:22] <Velveeta> andrewanderson: it means the value has changed..
[18:39:27] <felixjet_> or just .name afaik
[18:39:39] <andrewanderson> Velveeta: is this a constant thing or when the focus has left?
[18:40:07] <Velveeta> andrewanderson: it depends on the type of element... selects will fire change immediately, inputs require a blur first i believe
[18:40:17] <andrewanderson> thank you Velveeta
[18:40:47] <Velveeta> no problemo
[18:41:04] <andrewanderson> er actually, one more question.. and i'm not so fluent in javascript that i can test this easily
[18:41:21] <andrewanderson> if i change the value of an input via some other function, does that call onchange on the input?
[18:42:01] <__joshua__> no
[18:42:06] <Velveeta> nope, a programmatic change won't trigger it
[18:42:14] <felixjet_> andrewanderson, http://jsfiddle.net/EUpbs/
[18:42:19] <Velveeta> hooray for consistent answers! :)
[18:42:50] <andrewanderson> thanks Velveeta
[18:42:57] <andrewanderson> er
[18:42:57] <felixjet_> you can type until you blue
[18:42:58] <andrewanderson> thanks felixjet_
[18:43:00] <felixjet_> blur*
[18:43:11] <andrewanderson> blur means take off focus? in my terms
[18:43:15] <felixjet_> yes
[18:43:23] <andrewanderson> thanks guys
[18:45:07] <felixjet_> Velveeta, liar!
[18:45:16] <felixjet_> a programmatic will trigger http://jsfiddle.net/EUpbs/2/
[18:45:18] <felixjet_> xD
[18:45:46] * Velveeta facepalms.
[18:45:46] <mikeche1en> anyone know the preferred way to get rid of link underline when using JQM 1.4 button()? http://jsfiddle.net/cZV22/1/
[18:46:04] <felixjet_> but only if you wants to :P
[18:46:07] <Velveeta> mike: i would think the preferred way would be through more specific css
[18:46:18] <Velveeta> felixjet_: that's not a programmatic change, that's a programmatic trigger
[18:46:29] * felixjet_ facepalms
[18:46:33] <Velveeta> so a programmatic change won't trigger the change event, but a trigger will
[18:46:43] <andrewanderson> mikeche1en: http://jsfiddle.net/cZV22/1/
[18:46:56] <felixjet_> yea, this wont http://jsfiddle.net/EUpbs/3/
[18:47:03] <Velveeta> rightio
[18:47:39] <andrewanderson> er, mikeche1en http://jsfiddle.net/cZV22/2/
[18:48:15] <felixjet_> it's weird behaviour anyway. because if you type, you are changing it
[18:48:24] <felixjet_> blame on keyup/down
[18:50:26] <andrewanderson> lame
[18:50:52] <mikeche1en> andrewanderson: i was trying to avoid overriding the css, its weird because in jqm 1.3 the buttons have no decorations by default
[18:51:50] <Velveeta> mike: is there a problem with using an actual button vs a hyperlink styled like one?
[18:52:55] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: the issue i had was that the button is being added programmatically to the dom, and for some reason the class or data options were not working
[18:54:09] <Velveeta> yeah i don't use jqm myself, so i'm not sure how it handles things added after it initializes
[18:54:17] <xniz> Velveeta, http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/ <--- thats about as good as i can get it
[18:54:47] <Velveeta> looks pretty good
[18:54:51] <xniz> still need to get this algorithm fixed up for the repositioning
[18:54:55] <xniz> not quite 100% exact
[18:55:25] <Velveeta> what's it off by?
[18:55:55] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: idk why but the icon is not showing up if i do it this way: http://jsfiddle.net/rN94W/1/
[18:56:50] <Velveeta> yeah i'm not sure of why either
[18:56:51] <xniz> if u resize the width of the window to where only 1 is showing, its a bit off
[18:57:17] <xniz> lets say you resize the width to the minimum, it doesnt center properly with the header
[18:57:21] <Velveeta> xniz: that's probably from using only margin-left
[18:57:23] <xniz> im very perfectionistic :P
[18:57:29] <Velveeta> try splitting it between left and right
[18:57:29] <xniz> ic
[18:57:32] <xniz> alright
[18:57:42] <Velveeta> margin: 34px 15px 0;
[18:58:25] <mikeche1en> andrewanderson Velveeta ok thanks, ill try the css override method
[18:59:21] <andrewanderson> hey, alright man, good luck
[19:04:53] <xniz> Velveeta,  ok i got the positioning perfect now, only one more problem lol
[19:05:33] <xniz> Velveeta, http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/
[19:05:40] <xniz> the shadow on the first thumbnail is out of whack
[19:07:13] <xniz> can never seem to win lol
[19:08:34] <Velveeta> you want to slim it up some or what? define "out of whack"
[19:09:59] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/
[19:10:12] <xniz> look at the first thumbnail in the list... on the left of it
[19:10:22] <xniz> its showing some funky black space.. like the shadow didnt render properly
[19:12:12] <felixjet_> what happens if you set contentType: false in an ajax request?
[19:12:23] <xniz> hmm i may know
[19:13:08] <Velveeta> xniz: i would try shrinking the size of that box-shadow... it's not that the left one is out of whack, it's that it doesn't have a neighboring right one to balance out where it ends, so there's kind of a hard line
[19:13:30] <xniz> ic
[19:13:32] <Velveeta> you could change that either by adjusting the spread width, blur, or color
[19:13:39] <xniz> ok
[19:13:41] <felixjet_> pf, i have a big problem
[19:13:47] <felixjet_> can someone help me? xD
[19:13:59] <Velveeta> setting contentType to false doesn't do anything that i know of
[19:14:07] <felixjet_> not with that
[19:14:17] <mikeche1en> andrewanderson Velveeta found the problem, in jqm 1.4 button options have to be specified as classes, not data- elements
[19:14:19] <felixjet_> the problem is that i need to send a file using $.ajax()
[19:14:29] <felixjet_> but i also need to set the contentType to 'multipart/form-data'
[19:14:45] <felixjet_> the problem is, if i do that, then in the backend i get this error - Error: Multipart: Boundary not found
[19:14:51] <Velveeta> mike: ahhhhh, good find, and weird
[19:15:08] <felixjet_> looks like jquery is not sending boundaries as part of multipart/form-data
[19:15:16] <Velveeta> felixjet_: you can't send a file with $.ajax that i'm aware of
[19:15:24] <felixjet_> you can
[19:15:39] <felixjet_> using processData: false and contentType: false
[19:15:40] <felixjet_> it works
[19:15:50] <felixjet_> but is not sent as multipart
[19:15:51] <xniz> k i got it a bit better
[19:16:07] <felixjet_> is sent as x-www-form-urlencoded
[19:16:48] <xniz> woot perfect
[19:17:07] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/ :D
[19:17:13] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[19:17:17] <xniz> seems to position good too
[19:17:19] <xniz> thank you Velveeta
[19:17:28] <dismist> xniz: thats tight
[19:17:39] <xniz> dismist,  thank you :D
[19:17:54] <Velveeta> felixjet_: to send by multipart, you need to do a standard form post... outside of that, you can only hope for xhr2 support, and do something with that, unless you want to use a flash failover
[19:17:59] <xniz> just a start of a new project
[19:18:39] <xniz> im a photoshop guy, so i havent perfected the art of putting my work into fully functioning css/html
[19:18:57] <dismist> u know what would make it even better for me is instead of an animated gif loader, an actual progress bar.  god knows that would be tough for such a small touch but it would be sweet
[19:19:43] <Velveeta> xniz: that explains a lot.. you sometimes have to sacrifice, or at least compromise, when moving from that pixel-perfect world into feasible web layouts
[19:19:58] <xniz> yes i understand :P
[19:20:01] <dismist> i got the opposite problem as u... i went way overboard with effects on my portfolio so its crashing browsers.  www.cssfx.com
[19:20:31] <dismist> someone's goign to have a seizure viewing it
[19:20:59] <Velveeta> holy skeuomorphic animations, batman!
[19:21:08] <xniz> lol
[19:21:16] <xniz> Velveeta,  is there a way to change the opacity of a drop shadow?
[19:21:25] <dismist> xniz: yup
[19:21:33] <xniz> mine is a bit too dark
[19:21:39] <Velveeta> xniz: use the rgba 4th parameter for opacity
[19:21:49] <xniz> ooh ok
[19:21:51] <xniz> thank you :D
[19:22:10] <dismist> box-shadow:[x] [y] [depth?] [spread] [color]       <--- set color to rgba(0,0,0,.25) which means black at 25% opacity
[19:22:50] <xniz> oh ya baby
[19:22:59] <xniz> loookin good
[19:25:51] <dismist> xniz: try this: ul#thumbnails li { border:3px solid rgba(0,20,0,.15) !important; }
[19:25:54] <dismist> looks pretty sweet
[19:26:10] <xniz> alright
[19:26:15] <Velveeta> i'd suggest not using !important
[19:27:09] <xniz> dismist,  nice little add on :P
[19:27:12] <dismist> because it causes re- ?
[19:27:33] <Velveeta> because you should always add styles via specificity vs forcing them in with !important
[19:27:56] <xniz> http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/HTML2/ :D updated with my shadows
[19:28:00] <xniz> seems to look ok
[19:28:08] <dismist> yeah but you know sometimes its just a lot easier to leave the old styles in there and band-aid it with some new ones using !important
[19:28:14] <dismist> for lazy motherfuckers like me
[19:28:22] <dismist> easier for reverting too
[19:28:36] <Velveeta> but then anytime you want to override *that*, you have to override with both specificity *and* !important
[19:28:42] <dismist> true
[19:28:49] <Velveeta> so you might as well skip the important directive to begin with, and always go with specificity
[19:29:26] <dismist> question on specificity... which one takes precedence on an image with id element?  html #element { } or img#element
[19:31:05] <Velveeta> good question, i'm looking that one up real quick, but i *believe* it's gonna be html #element
[19:32:06] <dismist> but definitely html img#element right ?
[19:32:24] <xniz> well thank you guys for the help. great advice :)
[19:32:31] <xniz> now to try and solve my next task
[19:33:01] <Velveeta> looks like they're actual even on their calculated score, so it would come down to the order they were specified in
[19:33:09] <Velveeta> xniz: no problemo
[19:33:13] <dismist> velveeta: how did you calculate that?
[19:33:15] <Velveeta> http://specificity.keegan.st/
[19:33:23] <dismist> oh, sweet
[19:33:44] <Velveeta> but the only way to know for sure is gonna be to throw them both into a stylesheet and see which one wins
[19:33:50] <Velveeta> and then reverse the order and make sure that's still the case
[19:34:04] <dismist> yeah but then browsers may render diff too if its something a bit squirrelly
[19:35:38] <Velveeta> i think the rules of css specifity are gonna be fairly consistent across browsers... the properties they support may be different, but the calculation of what merged set gets applied is pretty standard as far as i know
[19:37:21] <__joshua__> reasonably standard.  the weights can differ, I believe
[19:37:45] <felixjet_> Velveeta, can you check this please? https://ghostbin.com/paste/wfkuv
[19:38:07] <felixjet_> when i do normal form submit, i get 1 form boundary in headers
[19:38:13] <felixjet_> with all the fields matching the boundary
[19:38:25] <felixjet_> but when i do the ajax request, i only get 1 field and it doesn't match the boundary
[19:38:26] <felixjet_> any idea?
[19:38:27] <felixjet_> :(
[19:38:50] <Velveeta> are you trying to submit a file?
[19:38:55] <felixjet_> yes
[19:39:05] <felixjet_> but i think if i remove the file input it will be the same
[19:39:06] <Velveeta> then my idea is everything i told you about that earlier
[19:39:21] <dismist> felix why all the webkit references?
[19:39:42] <dismist> ohhh thats just the log from you submitting in a webkit browser... i see
[19:39:43] <felixjet_> don't know, thats what appear in the headers
[19:39:49] <felixjet_> yes
[19:40:00] <dismist> application/octet-stream does not look right
[19:40:09] <felixjet_> why?
[19:40:13] <felixjet_> thats how files are sent
[19:40:26] <felixjet_> well, thats not related tbh
[19:40:27] <dismist> i thought thats how they were downloaded (streamed to user downloading)
[19:41:00] <Velveeta> right
[19:42:33] <felixjet_> yea, also
[19:42:41] <felixjet_> but a stream can be both ways
[19:42:46] <felixjet_> streamed to server
[19:42:58] <felixjet_> thats how files are sent, not even related with my issue
[19:43:10] <felixjet_> i removed the file, so only text fields are there
[19:43:18] <felixjet_> and using the ajax request, it's still the same
[19:43:25] <felixjet_> i only get 1 boundary
[19:43:33] <felixjet_> and it doesn't match any field
[19:55:18] <Velveeta> is your form data received properly on the back end?
[19:56:56] <felixjet_> im trying to find the problem yet, but i think it's because the ajax request doesn't send boundaries
[19:57:28] <Velveeta> put up a sample of your call to $.ajax
[19:57:41] <felixjet_> having a simple request like: $.ajax({ url: form.attr('action'), type: 'PUT',
[19:57:41] <felixjet_>  contentType: 'multipart/form-data', data: {foo:'bar'}
[19:57:52] <felixjet_> doesn't send boundaries
[19:58:06] <dismist> hey felix... how come it says "suscription"
[19:58:22] <felixjet_> while the basic form submit does
[19:58:30] <felixjet_> dismist, thats the field name
[19:58:35] <dismist> oh
[19:59:52] <felixjet_> i tried with POST too, in case PUT is weird
[19:59:55] <felixjet_> but same problem
[20:00:01] <felixjet_> boundaries are not sent
[20:01:02] <felixjet_> while using basic form submit it does
[20:01:07] <Velveeta> and what browser(s) are you checking this in?
[20:01:10] <felixjet_> chrome
[20:01:38] <Velveeta> and what browsers are you looking to support for this?
[20:02:38] <felixjet_> chrome
[20:02:42] <felixjet_> anyway in firefox happens too
[20:05:30] <Velveeta> and are you using a FormData object to collect all of your formdata into and feed to $.ajax?
[20:06:06] <felixjet_> Velveeta, https://ghostbin.com/paste/zwjmd
[20:06:09] <felixjet_> that in firefox
[20:06:16] <felixjet_> no, i removed it to isolate the problem
[20:06:24] <felixjet_> im using data: {foo:'bar'},
[20:06:34] <Velveeta> i don't wanna the raw transport, i'd rather see the js you're using
[20:06:58] <felixjet_> $.ajax({ url: form.attr('action'), type: 'PUT', contentType: 'multipart/form-data', data: {foo:'bar'}
[20:07:00] <felixjet_> thats the request
[20:10:51] <proteneer> is there a way to disable certificate validation when making http requests in jquery?
[20:10:55] <proteneer> (for debuggin purposes etc)
[20:12:52] <Velveeta> you could make the certificate optional on the server side, and call to it with http vs https... or send it from an https page that you've already told the browser was ok, and send it with a protocol-relative path
[20:13:31] <Velveeta> but there's not like a header or something that you can pass that says don't validate the cert on this request
[20:13:34] <proteneer> so my service is on frontend.foo.com
[20:13:47] <proteneer> and it's making HTTPS requests to backend.foo.com
[20:14:31] <Velveeta> ok... can it make http vs https requests to backend.foo.com?
[20:14:55] <xniz> is it "professional" to use alot of external jquery libraries in a project?
[20:14:58] <proteneer> backend serves only https as a policy
[20:15:03] <xniz> i know some u have to buy licenses for
[20:15:37] <Velveeta> xniz: i wouldn't call it professional at all, or unprofessional, but you should be more concerned with the total transfer weight
[20:16:00] <xniz> right. to make pages load quicker?
[20:16:20] <Velveeta> proteneer: then you'll have to make standard https requests to it.. there's no way to disable validation of the cert from the ajax function
[20:16:27] <Velveeta> xniz: right
[20:16:36] <proteneer> Velveeta: I see
[20:16:50] <Velveeta> can you disable that policy on the back end for debugging purposes?
[20:17:07] <xniz> i need to figure out how to have more control over my animations... for example, on the page im working on, id like to fade the logo first, then do the thumbnails.. i know someone mentioned something about that last night
[20:17:14] <xniz> .queue maybe?
[20:17:42] <Velveeta> yes, you can queue animations.. you can also chain them all together using their promise objects to execute your callbacks as they complete
[20:17:45] <xniz> the thumbnail animations lags because the logo fades at the same time
[20:18:04] <xniz> got a quick easy tutorial on call backs?
[20:18:17] <Velveeta> you could do something like $('#logo').fadeOut().promise().done(function () { someFunctionToBringInThumbnails(); });
[20:18:28] <xniz> ic
[20:18:38] <xniz> will give it a go
[20:20:25] <xniz> Velveeta, perfect!! is that a callback event?
[20:20:51] <felixjet_> meh, great waste of time
[20:21:01] <felixjet_> i was using badly the FormData
[20:21:07] <felixjet_> stupid internet tutorials
[20:21:08] <felixjet_> xD
[20:21:26] <felixjet_> if i do var foo = new FormData(); foo.append('text', 'bar');
[20:21:34] <felixjet_> i get the boundary for name="text"
[20:21:42] <felixjet_> but if i do new FormData(form);
[20:21:46] <felixjet_> i dont get anything
[20:21:52] <felixjet_> being form an instance of the current form
[20:22:04] <detrate> I'm curious if anyone has experience with using data attributes to trigger events as such: http://codepen.io/acodesmith/pen/bkafu
[20:22:25] <Velveeta> xniz: callbacks are just a development pattern, that's using a promise object from a jquery animation deferred, which you pass a callback to, to be executed when the promise is resolved, signalling the end of the animation
[20:22:31] <detrate> or perhaps could recommend a better method. I'm attempting to keep as much in the markup as possible so users won't have to touch much javascript
[20:22:44] <xniz> oo ic :P
[20:23:13] <Velveeta> detrate: to trigger events, or to bind event listeners?
[20:23:32] <detrate> bind event listeners, both defaults (such as click, hover) and custom functions
[20:24:15] <Velveeta> if you're looking for a declarative approach to your markup, you should look into using something like angular, which implements that sort of thing at its core
[20:24:37] <Velveeta> otherwise, if you're sticking to jquery, then that approach would be fine, you'll just have to do all the heavy lifting yourself
[20:24:50] <xniz> Velveeta,  http://studio.xniz-solutions.com/ such a small piece of code can make such a difference :D
[20:24:59] <detrate> alright, thanks. Just wasn't sure if a better solution was developed already
[20:25:32] <felixjet_> ey, just curious
[20:25:38] <felixjet_> why inside $('form').on('submit', function(e) {
[20:25:41] <Velveeta> angular is all about declarative markup like that.. i can't personally stand it, but some people love it :)
[20:25:59] <felixjet_> i have to do: var foo = new FormData($(this)[0]);
[20:25:59] <detrate> jQuery would be more portable for my use case fwiw
[20:26:09] <felixjet_> instead of: var foo = new FormData($(this));
[20:26:09] <Velveeta> xniz: you should also use css to transition that fadeIn effect, vs doing it with javascript, you'll get even better performance
[20:26:10] <felixjet_> ?
[20:26:23] <xniz> oh yeah? :d ill check it out
[20:26:25] <Velveeta> felixjet_: do new FormData(this)
[20:26:26] <felixjet_> why that [0] ? i'm not already selecting the form with $(this)?
[20:26:40] <Velveeta> $(this) is a jquery-wrapped instance of that dom element, not the dom element itself
[20:26:53] <Velveeta> $(this)[0] is the dom reference itself, as is just plain old this
[20:26:56] <felixjet_> :/ i always used $(this)
[20:27:13] <Velveeta> $(this)[0] === this
[20:27:17] <felixjet_> so basically
[20:27:24] <felixjet_> if i want to chain methods like .find()
[20:27:27] <Velveeta> you're just adding the overhead of wrapping it in a jquery constructor and then deconstructing it for no reason
[20:27:28] <felixjet_> i have to use $(this)
[20:27:31] <Velveeta> right
[20:27:32] <felixjet_> but if not, just this
[20:27:34] <Velveeta> right
[20:27:38] <felixjet_> i see, thank you!
[20:27:46] <xniz> Velveeta,  but how would i control the animation using css?
[20:27:56] <xniz> what i have now is pretty simple and straight forward
[20:27:58] <Velveeta> if you just need to deal with the raw element, for things like this.elements, this.childNodes, etc, just use this... if you want to use jquery functions, use $(this)
[20:28:51] <Velveeta> xniz: using transform to fade it in... after giving it a class to do just that.. i'll whip up a fiddle to demonstrate
[20:29:00] <felixjet_> what if i have both posibilities?
[20:29:08] <felixjet_> $(this).attr('action') vs this.action
[20:29:11] <xniz> alright thank you. i think i understand the concept
[20:29:13] <felixjet_> seconf prefered?
[20:29:15] <felixjet_> second*
[20:29:55] <felixjet_> sound like yes, but wanna confirm :p
[20:30:14] <felixjet_> as the first one is probably the same but involving jquery and wasting resources
[20:30:24] <felixjet_> or thats what i've understand at least
[20:30:29] <Velveeta> i usually use jquery to grab attributes
[20:31:14] <felixjet_> but it's not "just adding the overhead of wrapping it in a jquery constructor and then deconstructing it for no reason" ?
[20:31:43] <felixjet_> although using attr() could be just a matter of preference
[20:31:51] <felixjet_> respectable
[20:34:42] <Velveeta> well, i would store it off to a variable, var $this = $(this);
[20:34:52] <Velveeta> then reference $this for any jquery purposes, and this for any native dom purposes
[20:37:40] <Velveeta> xniz: here's an example using a css transition and a js event listener for transitionend: http://jsfiddle.net/GpwSW/
[20:37:43] <Velveeta> view it in chrome
[20:39:05] <Velveeta> so it's essentially the same thing as the jquery fadeIn() approach, and about the same amount of code, but one lets css do the job of that fadein, and the other has js constantly modifying the opacity value
[20:42:20] <xniz> oo
[20:42:31] <xniz> I see that. ill try and replicate it on both my logo and gradient
[20:42:32] <xniz> :D
[20:43:38] <Velveeta> that example i posted isn't cross-browser safe, so you'll want to put at least the -moz and -webkit equivalents
[20:43:44] <Velveeta> depending on what browsers you're supporting
[20:44:19] <Velveeta> and -ms will work for ie10+
[20:45:47] <xniz> ic
[20:47:55] <xniz> mm made it a bit laggier
[20:48:10] <xniz> the third animation is a bit slow
[21:01:23] <tase> im strangely stuck, im trying to slice the last 3 characters off a number/string
[21:01:31] <tase> new Date().getTime().slice(0,-3); doesn't seem to work
[21:01:55] <Velveeta> do you want to trim the last 3, or retrieve the last 3?
[21:02:00] <tase> trim the last 3
[21:04:16] <Velveeta> it ain't a pretty thing... (new Date()).getTime().toString().substring(0, (new Date()).getTime().toString().length-3)
[21:05:24] <snover> that is the dumbest code i have seen in a while
[21:05:43] <tase> yea i just had to do .toString().slice(0,-3)
[21:05:55] <tase> missed the toString
[21:06:54] <Velveeta> well there we go, i didn't realize string.slice was a thing, i've always seen it in the context of array.slice
[21:16:26] <daraand> Where would I add a .fadeIn and .fadeOut() here? -> http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/vfbFu/12/
[21:17:55] <__joshua__> use it instead of hide and show
[21:18:38] <daraand> __joshua__ :D ok
[21:20:35] <daraand> Well that works, It looks like I can create case where nothing appears for some reason
[21:20:57] <daraand> http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/vfbFu/14/
[21:21:05] <daraand> Actually you know the only thing bugging me now?
[21:21:42] <daraand> Is the poster always seems off -> http://jsfiddle.net/daraand/vfbFu/15/
[21:24:07] <Velveeta> poster?
[21:27:26] <daraand> in the video tag, it either flashes or just seems off. not sure why
[21:29:25] <__joshua__> yeah, i wouldn't expect fadeIn to work with video reliably
[21:29:51] <daraand> It sure is clunky.
[21:30:13] <daraand> There is a doc on adobe I was reading that could work - doing everything in CSS: http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/11/html-video-effects2.html
[21:30:27] <daraand> bu Im not sure if thats any different than fadeOut
[21:32:44] <daraand> Thanks for all your help __joshua__ youve been great today :D
[21:35:14] <__joshua__> happy to help
[21:54:09] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Hi, I have a one question
[21:56:44] <Gorakhpuriya> if I want the keypress shoul be work in a particualr area, so how it would be possible?
[21:56:54] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: in this http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/23/
[22:14:42] <Gorakhpuriya> if I want the keypress shoul be work in a particualr area, so how it would be possible? http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/23/
[22:17:55] <motaka2> why varNames is undefined but sourcedata is not in this code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/11165264
[22:29:25] <Cork> motaka2: the function is returning undefined?
[22:31:22] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:
[22:31:34] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  HI, Are you there?
[22:33:16] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: to and from, can't look at bigger things right now
[22:36:52] <Gorakhpuriya> Would you please tell me how can we make a arrpw key should be work in a particular region ..Structure http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/29/
[22:38:17] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: special structure?
[22:39:09] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Yes should be work in a green area only..
[22:40:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/30/ ?
[22:41:48] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: NO, I have want if we press arrow key out of the green background it should be not work.. Are you getting my question?
[22:42:05] <Cork> ah
[22:42:18] <Cork> it's a bit harder, but ya doable
[22:43:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/33/
[22:46:00] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Here is arrowkey is not working in green area also
[22:46:30] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you need to click in the green area (like top 10 px)
[22:51:45] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Thanks, but is it possible that it can be work without click?
[22:59:17] <Yahkob> So if you append an item you can use .delegate to click right?
[22:59:23] <Yahkob> Do i have the right idea?
[23:00:01] <Cork> Yahkob: yes
[23:00:13] <Cork> Yahkob: or the delegate format of .on
[23:04:23] <Yahkob> I feel very dumb.. I cannot get it to work
[23:05:38] <Cork> Yahkob: make a fiddle with your code
[23:05:45] <Yahkob> thats what I was going to say
[23:05:55] <Yahkob> I'm going to replicate my issue
[23:09:40] <Besan> LOOK at my code please: http://jsbin.com/rikuk/2/edit
[23:09:58] <Besan> I'm fighting with this issue for more than a month
[23:10:16] <Besan> Nobody can give me an real solution
[23:10:26] <Besan> or atleast a clue
[23:11:12] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  can you please tell me is it possible to work arrowkeypressed on focus, even not on clcik
[23:12:11] <Besan> My problem is: I set setTimeout() for every 5 secs . . . Everything works . . . no i need to update the data in my collapsible set without collapsing the collapsible
[23:12:54] <Besan> So, if i have a expanded <div> i need it to remain expanded even after it reloads itself . . .
[23:13:26] <Besan> People ?
[23:13:37] <morfin> hello
[23:13:43] <Besan> Hello
[23:14:53] <Besan> Did anyone looked at my fiddle ?
[23:14:53] <Besan> C'mon guys, life is now :)
[23:15:08] <morfin> anybody can help me i am doing this: $("[name='custom[field_name]']").datepicker() but when clicking that field i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined. Rechecked there no duplicating datepickers, i am binding it in .ready() handler
[23:15:13] <morfin> any ideas?
[23:16:25] <morfin> i am using jquery-ui-1.9.2.js
[23:16:48] <Besan> morfin, i'm new to jquery but atleast i read your question and answer it somehow :) hope you'll get any luck cause i don't :(
[23:17:27] <fella6s> Besan, first fgs I suggest you to clean(== properly indent) that code
[23:18:02] <fella6s> second, don't point out my spelling mistakes
[23:18:10] <Besan> :)
[23:18:36] <fella6s> third, UPDATE data don't rewrite everything
[23:19:02] <Besan> fella6s, this code is just for testing purposes . . . I need to get the idea on how to construct the logic of the updating without rewriting
[23:19:14] <Besan> yeees . . . that's what i need
[23:19:30] <Besan> I don't know how to update without rewriting
[23:20:06] <Besan> Can you do some changes to the code that i provided just to show me an working example . . . Fromn there i'll get it myself
[23:21:01] <morfin> i suspect datepicker plugin is buggy
[23:21:14] <morfin> because other plugins works after binding properly
[23:21:46] <fella6s> find corresponding div, something like $("#" + item.id)
[23:22:33] <fella6s> when you get it, find what you need to update and update it
[23:23:08] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: focus is click
[23:23:15] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: do you mean hover?
[23:25:21] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: yes, when I scroll the page and when we reach the particular green section it allow to work with arrow key pressed. Getting my point?
[23:25:31] <Besan> fella6s, can you please edit that in the code ? I'm new to jQuery so it's not yet that easy to get your suggestion . . . :)
[23:25:51] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: when you scroll...
[23:26:00] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: that isn't even focus
[23:26:06] <Cork> *hover
[23:26:13] <Gorakhpuriya> yes
[23:26:20] <Cork> that's a "rendered"
[23:26:23] <Cork> and hmm
[23:26:40] <Cork> well you could grab the .position().top of the div
[23:26:55] <Cork> and check if it is bigger then the height of the viewport
[23:27:16] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Okies... Thanks
[23:27:54] <fella6s> Besan, how much do you get paid doing this and what is my share?
[23:28:35] <morfin> shit
[23:29:04] <morfin> my issue can't be repeated :(
[23:29:51] <Besan> fella6s, i'm just learning . . . I would share if i would have any profit out of this . . . This is just practice . . .
[23:30:01] <Cork> morfin: it can, it is just something other then what you thought it was :)
[23:30:16] <morfin> it's impossible
[23:30:27] <morfin> because of specific code
[23:30:59] <morfin> i was trying to recreate situation on jsfiddle but it works :(
[23:31:22] <Cork> ya, like i said, cause the problem is somewhere other then where you thought it was
[23:34:17] <morfin> anyway
[23:34:22] <morfin> plugin is buggy
[23:34:39] <morfin> sliders\buttons\etv works fine
[23:52:02] <Yahkob> Still around cork ?
[23:52:12] <Cork> ya
[23:52:23] <Yahkob> Alright think I got it replicated
[23:52:33] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/piqif/1/edit
[23:53:00] <Cork> heh
[23:53:07] <Cork> no i didn't mean that by on
[23:53:11] <Yahkob> ?
[23:53:12] <Yahkob> oh yeah
[23:53:13] <Yahkob> woops
[23:53:15] <Yahkob> that got in there
[23:53:16] <CrowX-> I have a mousemove event handler that I don't want to work if the client has a touch device. How can I check if there's a touch device present?
[23:53:32] <Yahkob> $("#user").delegate("click",function(){ ?
[23:53:47] <Cork> Yahkob: you can't use id's multiple times
[23:53:48] <CrowX-> I need this because I don't want a touch event to trigger the mousemove event, which it does, and it's impractical
[23:54:32] <morfin> hmm
[23:54:36] <Yahkob> Ah I see
[23:54:47] <Yahkob> Am I doing something wrong with delegate other than multiple ids?
[23:54:47] <morfin> i think i need datetimepicker without jquery
[23:55:04] <morfin> because there no way of getting proper datetimepicker
[23:55:16] <morfin> *even datepicker does not work for me
[23:57:40] <Cork> Yahkob: http://jsbin.com/palogena/1/edit
[23:58:35] <Yahkob> oh man Cork I feel like an idiot
[23:58:49] <Yahkob> sorry about that
[23:59:05] <Cork> Yahkob: the removal of those ids is important btw
[23:59:14] <Cork> Yahkob: an id can only ever match one element
[23:59:29] <Cork> so when you duplicate it like you do you will have match problems
[23:59:31] <Yahkob> Yeah one specific id not just a bunch of appended elements
[23:59:47] <Yahkob> one specific element*
