[00:00:45] <shebbi> I can't even get this to alert :-(
[00:00:46] <shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/ydtdaj00/2/
[00:00:49] <shebbi> sad day
[00:01:49] <ruby_on_tails> i see the alert shebbi
[00:02:12] <shebbi> i press run and nothing happens
[00:02:31] <ruby_on_tails> alert("click to start"); it shows alert for this to me
[00:02:33] <ruby_on_tails> on RUN
[00:02:39] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/q0qn9tp2/
[00:03:40] <shebbi> ruby_on_tails: yeh doesn;t work on IE 11. now working on chrome. but if you click on cancelrequest i don't get "YES"
[00:04:17] <Cork> shebbi: ok, so the problem is the complete opposite of what you explained before
[00:04:29] <Cork> shebbi: $() builds a list of elements matching the selector
[00:04:41] <Cork> .click() then loops that array and adds event listeners to those elements
[00:04:51] <Cork> if you later change the classes on the element
[00:04:59] <Cork> it won't magically remove the attached event listeners
[00:05:09] <shebbi> Cork: it use too
[00:05:14] <Cork> no
[00:05:26] <Cork> i has never worked like that
[00:05:36] <Cork> delegated event handlers works like that
[00:05:44] <Cork> but on/bind has never done it
[00:05:46] <shebbi> Cork: trust me, it was working.
[00:05:49] <Cork> no
[00:06:18] <Cork> shebbi: you might have mixed it up with .live
[00:06:29] <Cork> as it was a messed up way to define delegated event handlers
[00:06:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ydtdaj00/3/
[00:06:32] <shebbi> Cork: i do remember something about delegated event handlers
[00:07:04] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: why did you use dequeue twice?
[00:07:26] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: something has to trigger the queue to get it to start unwinding
[00:07:37] <Cork> and each iteration has to trigger the next entry
[00:07:42] <Cork> == two dequeue
[00:08:30] <shebbi> Cork: is what you just did /3/ called delegated event handling?
[00:08:37] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: tell me if i am wrong, when i add a queue i add something to do, and it stops there unless i dequeue so that it moves to the next queue
[00:08:42] <Cork> shebbi: yes, that is one way to do delegation
[00:09:03] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: if you add a queue you add an entry in a queue
[00:09:03] <ruby_on_tails> this queue-dequeue is confusing
[00:09:12] <Cork> that a dequeue with the same name will trigger
[00:09:24] <Cork> after your done nothing will happen until you call .dequeue again
[00:09:35] <ruby_on_tails> dequeue triggers the queue?
[00:09:45] <Cork> basically queue is a push/shift array solution
[00:09:51] <ruby_on_tails> if i dont call dequeue what i wrote in queue wont occur?
[00:09:55] <Cork> it pulls the first entry in the array and .calls it
[00:10:19] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: jquery calls the fx queue on its own
[00:10:27] <Cork> if you use a custom one you have to do the work your self
[00:12:12] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: an alternative solution giving similar effect http://jsfiddle.net/q0qn9tp2/1/
[00:12:34] <shebbi> Cork: my script looks more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ydtdaj00/4/ . would doing it your will now show lots of 'documents'
[00:13:26] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: and yet another example http://jsfiddle.net/q0qn9tp2/2/
[00:13:37] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/pfq1mLjf/ how does this work without any deququq?
[00:14:09] <Cork> shebbi: you should avoid using document, unless you really don't have another parent that is static
[00:14:47] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: jquery triggers $(this).dequeue('fx'), this triggers the delay
[00:15:01] <Cork> delay triggers the dequeue('fx') after it is done
[00:15:06] <Cork> and triggers your function
[00:15:14] <Cork> that then kills the queue
[00:15:19] <Cork> (cause it doesn't call dequeue)
[00:15:28] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: how does this work then? http://jsfiddle.net/pfq1mLjf/1/
[00:15:38] <Cork> same
[00:15:45] <Cork> just remove the delay section
[00:16:08] <ruby_on_tails> is it triggering because the queue is of type 'fx' by default and jquery dequeues fx on its own?
[00:16:19] <shebbi> I dont get why this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/ydtdaj00/5/
[00:16:24] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: yes
[00:16:55] <ruby_on_tails> then why do i have to use any names, coming back to my first question, why does promise have a problem with my queue using css3 animations? is such a queue not of type 'fx' by default?
[00:19:12] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://pastebin.com/JHWWrPbc "asd" is never logged, #9 #11 #15 trigger fine why?
[00:19:41] <user234> in firebug $('dd').each( function( index, element ){console.log($(element).text())  });  shows the elements I want to change, but $('dd').each( function( index, element ){$(element).text().replace(/a/g, 'XXX');  });  changes nothing I can see.. Why?
[00:20:05] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: http://pastebin.com/RcV7Er5X easier to read
[00:20:43] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: i am dequeueing on #16
[00:21:45] <shebbi> is it weird to have all these '(document)' in this script. seems redundant
[00:21:51] <shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/ydtdaj00/8/
[00:25:27] <sacho> just cache it, or something.
[00:32:59] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: got it why you used dequeue twice
[00:36:22] <fRAiLtY-> How can I make the div (.mini-cart) be part of the hover effect, as when I mouseleave the li it disappears, once it's show I'd like it to be part of the hover effect if that makes sense, only disappearing if I mouse leave either element http://pastie.org/9574552#
[00:44:48] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: final question http://jsfiddle.net/q0qn9tp2/4/ why no alert?
[00:51:45] <ruby_on_tails> anyone else?
[01:02:41] <zfmf> is there a reason, why my ui.originalPosition  is always 0 on draggable element
[01:05:20] <ruby_on_tails> got dc
[01:05:37] <ruby_on_tails> did i miss anything?
[01:09:11] <Cork> no
[01:09:29] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: the problem is that you trigger the queue individually
[01:09:42] <Cork> and i don't think promise will catch that
[01:09:48] <Cork> not sure though
[01:10:03] <Cork> oh, wait
[01:10:04] <Cork> sorry
[01:10:13] <Cork> i missed that you don't dequeue the custom queue
[01:10:15] <Cork> ..
[01:10:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/q0qn9tp2/5/
[01:10:45] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: did you even listen to the "you have to dequeue the next step in the queue" part??
[01:23:01] <fRAiLtY-> How can I make the div (.mini-cart) be part of the hover effect, as when I mouseleave the li it disappears, once it's show I'd like it to be part of the hover effect if that makes sense, only disappearing if I mouse leave either element http://pastie.org/9574552#
[01:23:42] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: add the elements to a common parent
[01:23:54] <Cork> and bind the event to the parent
[01:25:11] <fRAiLtY-> So, like add the mini-cart div to the cart li for example?
[01:25:48] <Cork> you only showed the code
[01:25:57] <Cork> so i can't answer the dom structure
[01:55:21] <batjony> hi guys
[01:55:45] <batjony> guys lets say i have <div class="nav navPrev"> and <div class="navNext"> and i have already a selector which holds both divs like var $nav = $('.nav');
[01:55:46] <batjony> how can I get the navPrev selector using my current $nav selector?   I have tried var $navPrev = $nav.has('.navPrev'), but this does not work
[01:59:50] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: but there is no next step after the div turns red
[02:00:14] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: yes there is, the step you define through .promise()
[02:00:30] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: oh so promise is also in the queue, hmm didnt know that
[02:00:31] <Cork> the reason you don't get that step is cause you never trigger it
[02:00:52] <ruby_on_tails> ok got it, never thought it was another step
[02:14:45] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: can tell why this isnt working? http://jsfiddle.net/mL1cj6wL/1/
[02:14:50] <user324> a java server send a unicode char which ist shown in firefox different than in chrome. The encoding in chrome ist utf-8. what could be the reason?
[02:15:08] <ruby_on_tails> console.log("1") does log 6 times
[02:15:09] <user324> in firefox its correct
[02:15:36] <Cork> cause you crash?
[02:15:46] <ruby_on_tails> crash?
[02:15:46] <Cork> i isn't defined
[02:15:54] <Cork> or sorry
[02:15:56] <Cork> missed line 2
[02:15:57] <ruby_on_tails> i is there in the function
[02:15:59] <ruby_on_tails> k
[02:16:04] <ruby_on_tails> and only the last div turns red, why?
[02:16:37] <ruby_on_tails> btw, is the queue in a code like this saved for every element separately? does that mean promise will trigger 6 times?
[02:16:57] <Cork> ah
[02:17:04] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you use a global variable
[02:17:09] <Cork> define your variables :)
[02:17:12] <Cork> $t is global
[02:17:26] <ruby_on_tails> facepalm
[02:18:25] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: sorry for that
[02:18:50] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: buy how does queue work in this case? all the divs have their own queues?
[02:18:57] <ruby_on_tails> how many times .promise() trigger?
[02:19:12] <ruby_on_tails> it does trigger once but like how do the internals work?
[02:31:21] <user243> $('dd').each( function( index, element ){$(element).text($(this).text().replace(/\s/g, '<span class="l10n-space"></span>'))  });                  the span are not interpreted. why?
[02:41:43] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: promise fire once per element ya
[02:41:51] <BinaryKitten> user243: $this....
[02:41:58] <BinaryKitten> the $(this) is not what you think it is
[02:41:59] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you should be able to use $.when if you want to collect it
[02:42:18] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: not completely sure about that though
[02:43:05] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: in that case there would be 6 alerts
[02:43:11] <ruby_on_tails> if it fired for each element
[02:43:24] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: well alerts is as always a bad testing tool
[02:43:32] <sahbeewah> user243: what do you mean not interpreted?
[02:43:37] <Cork> but replacing it with console.log shows one message
[02:43:49] <Cork> so yes .promise collects them like $.when normally does
[02:44:04] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[02:46:16] <sahbeewah> uh, promise only fires once
[02:46:22] <sahbeewah> by definition
[02:46:36] <Cork> sahbeewah: not really
[02:46:43] <Cork> promise can fire multiple times
[02:46:58] <Cork> opps sorry
[02:47:02] <Cork> i thought of deferred
[02:47:21] <Cork> though deferred is a type of promise
[02:48:13] <sahbeewah> promise is a ‚Äúsubclass‚Äù of deferred
[02:48:38] <sahbeewah> but in any case, ruby_on_tails, that promise is waiting on your animation queue to finish
[02:48:59] <sahbeewah> that code probably isn‚Äôt doing what you think it is because you have a closure problem
[02:49:06] <mento> hey guys, for my responsive website i want to target jQuery UI tabs with a <select> box instead of anchors but i cant figure how to get it to work
[02:50:02] <mento> how can i make it work that it uses the value of the option instead of the regular way, by anchors
[02:50:05] <sahbeewah> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/mL1cj6wL/4/
[02:50:45] <Cork> sahbeewah: that isn't the problem
[02:50:46] <ruby_on_tails> sahbeewah: what did you do in there?
[02:50:54] <Cork> the problem was that he created a global variable
[02:51:09] <Cork> that was simple to fix with var
[02:51:24] <Cork> the remaining problem is why the promise isn't triggering
[02:51:39] <Cork> and for me it is cause transition isn't fireing (and i just found why)
[02:53:10] <sahbeewah> it‚Äôs triggering for me? getting the alert
[02:53:15] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you missed the none jquery css property
[02:53:19] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/mL1cj6wL/5/
[02:53:27] <Cork> sahbeewah: meaning you run webkit
[02:53:38] <Cork> in trident or gecko it doesn't work
[02:53:59] <sahbeewah> right, sorry didn‚Äôt read
[02:54:01] <ruby_on_tails> i am on chrome
[02:54:26] <Cork> that isn't an excuse to write webkit only code
[02:55:02] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: the remaining problem is that a function doesn't scope the arguments
[02:55:21] <Cork> so i isn't "remembered" cross the .each calls
[02:55:38] <Cork> the solution is to either use var <variable> = i; and use that
[02:55:51] <Cork> or pass it as an argument to the queue like sahbeewah did
[02:56:04] <Cork> (the later is normally prefered as it gives cleaner code)
[02:56:13] <ruby_on_tails> hm
[02:56:28] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/mL1cj6wL/6/
[02:56:37] <Cork> removed the unused outer $t variable
[02:56:54] <Cork> hmm though that creates an extra function scope
[02:57:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/mL1cj6wL/7/ <-- the alternative solution
[02:59:38] <mento> guys how can i get jquery UI tabs to work with values from an option instead of an anchor? cant seem to find how to do this
[03:00:06] <Cork> mento: last i checked tabs is quite hard to extend
[03:00:25] <Cork> and quite simple in what it does; so might not be worth the effort
[03:01:18] <ruby_on_tails> finally got it working on my script
[03:01:19] <ruby_on_tails> phew
[03:01:23] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: you are a boss!
[03:01:26] <ruby_on_tails> thanks dude
[03:01:43] <decx> what change the active tab with an option mento?
[03:01:46] <ruby_on_tails> you wanna see what i am doing with this queueing?
[03:01:58] <decx> use the active setting
[03:11:45] <mento> Cork:  i see but shouldnt be that hard i suppose
[03:12:03] <mento> the only thing it has to do is get the selected value and show the related tab div
[03:14:46] <Cork> mento: the load event and the load command should be able to get you somewhat there
[03:15:08] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#method-load
[03:15:12] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load
[03:15:32] <mento> Cork:  i will try
[03:24:26] <mento> i created a little fiddle with a preview: http://jsfiddle.net/pgqn6v7n/2/
[03:25:00] <mento> getting the value isnt a problem ofcourse, just cant seem to find how to hook the value with the right tab
[03:25:31] <ruby_on_tails> http://pastebin.com/mJc5z2d0 how can i set a default for a variable sent to a plugin? i know how to set the default for an object, but how to do it for a variable?
[03:26:37] <decx> .tabs('option','active',this.selectedIndex)
[03:27:52] <Kingsy> if I have a var containing an element which has multiple <div> children, how do I run an each() on the divs?
[03:28:10] <decx> .children('div').each
[03:28:45] <Kingsy> ah awesome
[03:29:11] <decx> make interval part of your options object ruby_on_tails
[03:29:20] <mento> thanks decx  that did the trick
[03:29:48] <ruby_on_tails> decx: no i want it outside
[03:29:56] <decx> well then have another extend
[03:30:11] <ruby_on_tails> how? i dont understand this extend thing
[03:30:55] <ruby_on_tails> extend merges objects right?
[03:31:06] <decx> it does
[03:31:18] <ruby_on_tails> what about simple variables like the one i need?
[03:31:22] <ruby_on_tails> its not an array/object
[03:31:53] <decx> so it's a number?
[03:31:58] <decx> like 500 for half a second
[03:34:00] <decx> just put it in the options object though
[03:34:01] <decx> -.-
[03:39:25] <ruby_on_tails> decx: yes its a number
[03:39:54] <ruby_on_tails> and then if i dont secify the number but i specify an object the plugin code should use the object for options and not interval, hows that possible?
[03:41:18] <ruby_on_tails> http://pastebin.com/Pq9d6uV1
[03:42:23] <decx> if you want an extra optional argument put it at the end
[03:42:40] <decx> otherwise you have to do mental gymnastics
[03:45:02] <ruby_on_tails> decx: but jquery does it with stuff like .animate()
[03:45:26] <ruby_on_tails> i can provide (prop, time, callback) or just (prop, callback) and it works
[03:45:53] <decx> well why dont you look in the source if you love it so much ^^
[03:46:02] <ruby_on_tails> heh :P
[03:46:42] <ruby_on_tails> i thought you guys would know something simple for that
[03:49:03] <decx> animate calls another function
[03:50:04] <decx> comes down to a ternary
[03:50:21] <decx> and some typeof blah === "object" stuff
[03:50:31] <decx> it's boring
[03:50:39] <decx> just put it in the options object ^^
[03:59:16] <ThePeach> hi all. I'm looking for a plugin that can crop and resize (canvas) an image that could work on mobile.
[03:59:47] <juslintek> Hi, I have this problem http://pastebin.com/SmF5hsfk I need to get the id used in the parent function in on(click function
[04:00:06] <juslintek> So my child function can use it in another post
[04:00:10] <decx> any mobile that supports canvas has no problems with a drawImage ThePeach
[04:01:04] <ThePeach> decx: yes, but cropping is my problem and I'd prefer to avoid reinventing the wheel. :)
[04:03:12] <decx> drawImage has 9 arguments or so for cropping
[04:03:40] <ThePeach> decx: are you suggesting me to implement it myself instead of using something already done?
[04:03:50] <decx> image, startofcropx,startofcropy, cropwidth, cropheight, basex, basey, basewidth, baseheight
[04:11:20] <t432> need to check if a string startswith some regexÖ.
[04:13:43] <juslintek> Is it legal to set function option like this? function(data, function(){ return $(this).attr("id"); } ) { }
[04:14:34] <Cork> juslintek: no
[04:14:45] <Cork> you declare variables there
[04:14:47] <Cork> not values
[04:15:16] <Cork> (function(data, callback) { })(someData, function(){ return $(this).attr("id"); }); would be ok though
[04:15:48] <juslintek> Cork, how can I get onclick used string which contains the id I need to be passed into child function?
[04:16:31] <juslintek> I'm hoping there is some invisible variable which can be passed into ajax success with the id it was first launched by.
[04:16:40] <Cork> juslintek: you mean call($(this).attr('id')) ?
[04:17:04] <juslintek> Cork yes, but within a function.
[04:17:12] <juslintek> look just a sec I will give you example.
[04:17:44] <Cork> $().on('click', function() { otherFunction($(this).attr('id'); });
[04:17:52] <Cork> opps
[04:17:54] <Cork> $().on('click', function() { otherFunction($(this).attr('id')); });
[04:19:24] <juslintek> http://pastebin.com/Fh5NViMh
[04:20:00] <Cork> not sure what that has to do with the question
[04:20:07] <juslintek> That #yt22 isn't fetched why?
[04:20:59] <Cork> juslintek: this inside the ajax callback isn't the same this as in the click handler
[04:21:12] <Cork> juslintek: you have to either save it in a different variable
[04:21:25] <Cork> or forward it through $.ajax with the context option
[04:21:26] <juslintek> Cork, that why I'm asking is there some way to get it via that callback function?
[04:21:38] <Cork> it isn't "via"
[04:21:48] <Cork> you need to get it TO the callback method
[04:21:50] <Cork> not via
[04:22:04] <juslintek> Okay, so I'll have to json_encode extra param.
[04:22:36] <Cork> no
[04:22:39] <juslintek> Cork, I was hoping for some magical variable in the ajax modal
[04:22:41] <juslintek> model
[04:22:45] <Cork> and you can't encode a dom element
[04:22:56] <juslintek> Cork, I can via php
[04:24:13] <Cork> juslintek: http://pastebin.com/012fRxfP
[04:24:15] <juslintek> the thing is that this ajax calls php function which has some other data with it. So it was easier problem that I thought, I was thinking to difficult.
[04:24:26] <Cork> juslintek: php can't access dom elements
[04:24:27] <Cork> at all
[04:24:40] <Cork> it can access html, but never that state of the page
[04:25:03] <juslintek> Cork, okay, thank you very much for this information. :-)
[04:26:09] <juslintek> Cork, that context saved my life :-D
[04:29:55] <aitiba> hi
[04:32:05] <aitiba> I have an ajax search that print the results and change the pagination. before call the ajax method if I click on a link on pagination goes well but after call ajax function and print all the content if I click on pagination link the event is not fired. øwhat I'm doing wrong please?
[04:53:00] <sprihodko> Can i allow user to remove tags, but not to write using select2? Tried to add readonly, but it preventing not only writing but also deleting
[04:53:26] <juslintek> Cork, it seemsthat it doesn't work, the context I was tricked by myself that via other function i got answer on console. As far as http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ tells context only works in complete.
[04:54:07] <Cork> juslintek: no context work in success
[04:54:18] <juslintek> Well then I get undefined in log.
[04:55:18] <user243> does somebody know a good solution to highlight whitespaces at the beginnen and the end of some text?   played arround with the following, but Chrome dos not support that unicode char. $('dd').each( function( index, element ){$(element).text($(this).text().replace(/\s/g, '\u23B5'))  });
[04:57:19] <juslintek> This http://pastebin.com/wUyLhk4n returns Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined. Because url is undefined, so $(this).attr("href"); doesn't work.
[04:58:29] <juslintek> probably just found out why. Its read as a string. Not as selector.
[05:01:18] <juslintek> Cork, how to get last element of the array?
[05:05:46] <decx> .pop()
[05:07:51] <juslintek> Cork, method of mine was fine, I just wrote lenght instead of length lol :-)
[05:14:56] <aitiba> I have a text appended by json call. If I call that json call on a html append by that call the event is not fired. ?what Im missingø
[05:17:02] <Cork> aitiba: please rephrase that
[05:17:27] <Cork> you append a text by a json call?
[05:17:44] <Cork> no i don't follow at all
[05:19:09] <aitiba> I make an ajax call. on success append some html.
[05:19:26] <aitiba> on that appended html I have another call to that json call by the event is not fired
[05:19:29] <aitiba> øwhy?
[05:19:58] <Cork> where does the json come into the picture?
[05:20:05] <Cork> and what is a json call?
[05:20:36] <Cork> ah, i think i get it now
[05:20:58] <Cork> aitiba: you have a registered event handler; and when you add new elements to the page the event handler doesn't work for those elements?
[05:21:19] <MikeD_> jsfiddle?
[05:21:33] <Cork> ya, might be a better option
[05:22:17] <aitiba> Cork: the json calls http://pastebin.com/aD7iQ7Vs
[05:23:21] <Cork> MikeD_: you have a clue what he means?
[05:23:55] <MikeD_> when I smurf a smurfy smurf the smurf doesn't smurf the way it should smurf
[05:24:38] <decx> man that's a big ass click event
[05:24:40] <Cork> aitiba: sorry i still don't understand what you mean by "json call"
[05:24:52] <Cork> and a huge bunch of global variables
[05:25:17] <decx> huh?
[05:25:22] <decx> oh right everything in the ajax call
[05:25:25] <decx> :D
[05:25:27] <Cork> ya
[05:29:53] <aitiba> so first I call $("#buttonLang").click and on resolve pirnt a new pagination . then If i click to that new pagination  $('ul.pagination li a').click() is not fired
[05:30:10] <aitiba> the problem is why is can not fire  $('ul.pagination li a').click()
[05:32:43] <elmargol> Hi there I need some sort of div popup to inform my visitors about a new service we offer. Just some text maybe 1 picture and a link to the product page. Is there something for this in jquery ui? dialog does not seem to be nice
[05:33:28] <aitiba> Cork: I think that now is more easy to understand my problem
[05:49:28] <Kingsy> how do you best go abouit removing a click event from an element ?
[05:50:02] <Kingsy> I basically want to unbind the current event and set a new one
[05:50:21] <Kingsy> I have tried off() and unbind()
[05:53:57] <decx> it is indeed off
[05:56:03] <Kingsy> doesnt seem to get rid of the event.. umm 1 second
[05:56:22] <Kingsy> yeah it doesnt
[05:56:38] <Kingsy> jQuery('.someLink a').off("click");
[05:58:39] <decx> it does
[05:59:44] <Kingsy> could it be the way I am assigning the original event --> .live("click",function(){ <- ?
[06:00:30] <decx> live is deprecated
[06:00:38] <Kingsy> ah
[06:00:46] <Kingsy> yeah I just changed it to on() and its perfect
[06:00:48] <Kingsy> oh well :D
[06:01:06] <decx> ^^
[06:01:28] <Jagst3r21> I am trying to get the dropdown to populate when clicking on the image, but no luck: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qBpdv
[06:03:05] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: An image can't have a value.
[06:03:14] <BillCriswell> You'd have to use a data- attribute or something along those lines.
[06:04:18] <decx> saving the selector as a string huh. that's a paddling
[06:05:06] <decx> and what is that load supposed to do anyway?
[06:05:17] <decx> that aint to url
[06:05:21] <decx> no
[06:05:28] <BillCriswell> that's ain't to url.
[06:05:37] <decx> good
[06:06:34] <MikeD_> "that's a paddlin" heh
[06:09:01] <Jagst3r21> more like this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qBpdv
[06:09:22] <decx> still with the load
[06:09:29] <decx> what do you think that does?
[06:09:45] <Jagst3r21> isnt it supposed to load into the dropdown?
[06:09:59] <decx> not that i know of
[06:10:03] <decx> there http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jloyI
[06:10:32] <Jagst3r21> the problem is I dont want a multiselect
[06:10:47] <decx> it's just multi so you dont have to click on it to see that it worked
[06:11:27] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: http://jsbin.com/sumaheveviye/1/edit?html,js,output this is what I came up with real quick... feels a little clunky though.
[06:11:34] <BillCriswell> This makes me appreciate MVVM a bit more.
[06:12:10] <decx> that's something completely different -.-
[06:13:14] <BillCriswell> I probably misunderstood as usual haha.
[06:13:24] <Jagst3r21> thanks
[06:13:27] <decx> makes more sense than adding based on the first example
[06:14:57] <decx> still weird, looks like a job for hidden radio buttons and colored labels
[06:15:51] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: If you had to do that multiple times it can be way cleaner cause you can do things just based on their container.
[06:15:51] <BillCriswell> Should have done that anyway.
[06:18:08] <BillCriswell> Agreed. As long as it's labeled right.
[06:18:17] <shebbi> <div id="foo"> <-- how to grab text "foo"?
[06:18:57] <sniperh4x0r> if you have a structure like this: <nav><ul></ul><ul></ul></nav>
[06:19:07] <BillCriswell> shebbi: $('#foo').text();
[06:19:15] <sniperh4x0r> how would you traverse it to tgarget the second ul/
[06:19:16] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[06:19:17] <sniperh4x0r> ?
[06:19:24] <BillCriswell> shebbi: $('#foo').prop('id')
[06:19:41] <Bhiughy> hello
[06:19:46] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: $('nav ul').eq(1) can do it
[06:19:47] <shebbi> ill try it out
[06:19:50] <Bhiughy> I have a problem
[06:19:53] <Bhiughy> Iset this var
[06:19:54] <Bhiughy> var utl = $(".totrmb1").text();
[06:20:04] <decx> nav ul + ul in css
[06:20:08] <Bhiughy> whenIdo alert(utl); show me empty
[06:20:39] <Bhiughy> but when the var is var utl = $(".totrmb1"); and I do alert(utl.text()); show me ok
[06:20:40] <Bhiughy> why?
[06:20:46] <sniperh4x0r> thanks BillCriswell
[06:21:16] <decx> because alert is shit Bhiughy use console
[06:21:25] <BillCriswell> decx: I think you'd need to do nav > ul + ul wouldn't you?
[06:21:33] <BillCriswell> I mean... nav + ul + ul
[06:22:03] <decx> well that last one wont do it
[06:22:11] <decx> for the other one it doesnt matter
[06:22:17] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: http://jsbin.com/sumaheveviye/2/edit?html,js,output
[06:22:34] <BillCriswell> Would the ul + ul get every ul after a ul though?
[06:22:40] <Bhiughy> decx : show me :: empty string too
[06:22:41] <BillCriswell> Yeah I messed that up.
[06:23:27] <Jagst3r21> wow thanks
[06:23:39] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell^
[06:23:43] <Jagst3r21> :)
[06:23:55] <BillCriswell> decx: nav ul:first-child + ul ?
[06:23:59] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: No problem!
[06:24:36] <decx> does it matter if there's just 2 ul in the nav?
[06:24:57] <BillCriswell> Yeah, good point.
[06:25:21] <decx> The new fragrance from bill criswell - - - verbosity
[06:25:30] <MikeD_> it won't matter until there's another ul...  then the "second one" and the "last one" are different
[06:25:39] <BillCriswell> I'd stink the joint up.
[06:25:56] <BillCriswell> Yeah, :last-child could also do it haha
[06:26:12] <BillCriswell> I bet OP cares far less than we do.
[06:26:20] <BillCriswell> or would he be OQ?
[06:26:34] <decx> it's #jquery so eq(1) will be best anyway
[06:26:37] <BillCriswell> I'm feeling this rebull this morning.
[06:26:50] <BillCriswell> decx: hahah
[06:28:07] <shebbi> <div id="foo" class="bar"> <-- how to grab text "foo" based on class attribute?
[06:28:21] <BillCriswell> shebbi: $('#foo').prop('id')
[06:28:26] <BillCriswell> Second time.
[06:28:38] <BillCriswell> $('.bar').prop('id');
[06:28:41] <BillCriswell> You changed it up on me.
[06:28:46] <shebbi> yeah i did
[06:28:53] <shebbi> didnt make much sense before
[06:29:38] <shebbi> it echos div.bar for me
[06:31:22] <BillCriswell> shebbi: http://jsbin.com/jiquhuresuya/1/edit
[06:36:02] <shebbi> BillCriswell: thanks
[06:36:08] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:37:06] <Bhiughy> http://jsfiddle.net/wb650uk5/
[06:37:15] <Bhiughy> you think this end sessionfunction isok?
[06:37:22] <john-dev> BillCriswell: is prop better then attr?
[06:37:53] <Bhiughy> should to be for 45 mins
[06:38:13] <BillCriswell> john-dev: Depends. I think people usually want prop but there are times when .attr() should be used. It's quite a pain in the ass.
[06:38:38] <john-dev> Bhiughy: this will conitnue checking the session, even after you destroyed it
[06:38:55] <john-dev> BillCriswell: hm, never used prop yet :)
[06:39:10] <decx> attr did everything a while ago
[06:39:21] <Bhiughy> what you suggest me for improve it?
[06:39:27] <decx> i always forget the usecase for it now
[06:39:38] <decx> default values on data- attributes maybe
[06:39:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Same.
[06:39:52] <john-dev> remove that interval if x[‚Äökey‚Äò] == 0 for example
[06:39:59] <BillCriswell> john-dev: http://api.jquery.com/prop/ the Attributes vs Properties" part here is pretty good.
[06:41:04] <john-dev> Hm..
[06:41:11] <john-dev> Looks like pain in the ass, indeed
[06:41:28] <MikeD_> why is it so difficult?
[06:41:31] <decx> for example $('div').prop('style','background:green') will still change the attribute
[06:41:45] <john-dev> attr wont?
[06:41:50] <decx> it will
[06:41:59] <decx> that's what makes it confusing
[06:42:05] <decx> attr used to do everything
[06:42:08] <decx> now prop does
[06:42:13] <john-dev> hmh.. i would use .css in that case anyway
[06:42:20] <decx> it's a contrieved example
[06:42:26] <john-dev> sure, ok..
[06:42:31] <shebbi> anyone here happens to use wordpress and jquery?
[06:42:32] <decx> -e
[06:42:49] <john-dev> shebbi: i do
[06:43:07] <shebbi> john-dev: may i pm you?
[06:43:12] <john-dev> sure
[06:43:34] <BillCriswell> john-dev: http://jsbin.com/xojudeyociti/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:44:08] <john-dev> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/wokilaxayali/1/edit
[06:44:09] <john-dev> :D
[06:44:36] <BillCriswell> What just happened?
[06:45:21] <john-dev> didnt see your console.log
[06:48:05] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:57:46] <Bhiughy> BillCriswell : you think thisscript have thing for improve
[06:57:46] <Bhiughy> http://jsfiddle.net/wb650uk5/
[07:01:25] <BillCriswell> Bhiughy: Why not redirect right to session/logout and let that direct the user somewhere? Seems weird to reload the current page once they're logged out?
[07:02:07] <john-dev_> BillCriswell: not if this page simply provides a different content for logged in users and guests
[07:02:18] <john-dev_> like a ‚Äûlight‚Äú version..
[07:02:34] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's why I said "seems" since I don't know all the details haha.
[07:02:47] <BillCriswell> I'm just thinking of usual situations... if there really is such a thing.
[07:03:14] <BillCriswell> When I get logged out of something I'm typically sent to a login screen.
[07:03:21] <john-dev_> i have to admit - i do the same thing.. show different contents for logged in / guests..
[07:03:45] <Bhiughy> BillCriswell : what hapenis that logout function only remove allthe session vars but doesn't reload the page
[07:04:12] <BillCriswell> Bhiughy: Seems ok to me then.
[07:04:19] <Bhiughy> Ok
[07:04:21] <Bhiughy> thank you
[07:08:21] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell any idea why its not working here? http://dev.semgeeks.com:8888/nrghome/hr-form/hr-form
[07:08:22] <john-dev_> Bhiughy: you still should remove that Interval if the session has been destroyed..
[07:08:28] <Jagst3r21> the file I have is custom-new.js
[07:08:45] <Jagst3r21> http://hastebin.com/oqegogalef.js
[07:12:45] <Jagst3r21> or anyone else...
[07:14:19] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: Line 8 probably shouldn't have an id in the selector.
[07:15:06] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: Also, "webform-component--test-2" should probably be like .webform-component--test-2
[07:16:04] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell I changed that but still no luck :/
[07:17:24] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: The html here is a little weird. I was expecting the images and select to have common parents for each pair.
[07:17:42] <Jagst3r21> yeah its drupal
[07:18:20] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell, however it should still work IMO
[07:19:34] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: Haha well. You'll need another way to bind the select and the swatches.
[07:20:18] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell why is that?
[07:21:26] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: You see how "fieldset-wrapper" holds both the select and the images. You can use $('.fieldset-wrapper') instead of $('.option1') and htat'll make the first work with the provided code.
[07:21:51] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: Because the structure is different for the bottom select + images than the top.
[07:23:10] <Jagst3r21> BillCriswell I changed that but it didn't seem to work
[07:23:26] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: You're trying to target elemnets outside of .fieldset-wrapper.
[07:24:24] <Jagst3r21> the drodown and images are within that wrapper though
[07:25:44] <BillCriswell> No it's not.
[07:26:33] <BillCriswell> webform-component--option1--test-2 is, but not webform-component--test2
[07:26:39] <Jagst3r21> wooooops
[07:26:45] <Jagst3r21> lol
[07:26:53] <BillCriswell> Drupal classes are a blast.
[07:27:10] <Jagst3r21> yeah
[07:27:18] <Jagst3r21> thanks for the help, I have learned a lot :)
[07:27:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: why did you revive the old nightmares...
[07:27:44] <BillCriswell> Jagst3r21: No problem.
[07:27:55] <Kingsy> if I have a string like this http://bloh.com/1/2/3/4/5/6.html   how would I go abouit getting "6" in a var by splitting the string? I do not know how many /'s there will be in the link and I also don't know hte length of the "6" it could be "6666" sp I cant count backwards
[07:28:00] <BillCriswell> Cork: I sowwy.
[07:28:05] <Kingsy> I am struggling to think of a solution on this
[07:28:33] <Cork> BillCriswell: i get a big flash back of class="block-1" right now
[07:28:39] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: url.split('/').pop().slice(0, url.indexOf('.'))
[07:28:46] * Cork shivers a bit
[07:30:01] <Cork> /(\d+)\.html/.exec(string) is another optio
[07:30:02] <BillCriswell> url.slice(url.lastIndexOf('/')).slice(0, url.indexOf('.')); could also work... but split is safer with older browsers than lastIndexOf
[07:30:05] <Cork> +n
[07:30:26] <BillCriswell> Er I messed up the last one.. just the .split() way would be fine.
[07:30:29] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: hrm its weird, it seems to be truncating the string
[07:30:39] <Kingsy> eh.. so weird
[07:31:18] <Cork> js> print(/(\d+)\.html/.exec('http://bloh.com/1/2/3/4/5/6.html')[1])
[07:31:23] <b-ot> Cork: 6
[07:32:01] <Kingsy> Cork: I am giving it a go with the .split() example
[07:32:02] <BillCriswell> Kingsy: http://jsbin.com/giqidawuwowa/1/edit?html,js,output I made the same mistake I did with the lastIndexOf way.
[07:32:12] <Kingsy> thats a little more readable for me
[07:32:52] <Kingsy> lets see
[07:35:38] <BillCriswell> earl.split(/\/|\./).slice(-2) weee
[07:35:57] <BillCriswell> [0]
[07:36:18] <Cork> lol
[07:37:39] <Cork> that is the kind of code that a developer 5 years down the road stops and things "WTF..."
[07:37:48] <Cork> *thinks
[07:37:58] <BillCriswell> Haha definitely.
[07:38:38] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to do url.split('/').pop().slice(0, whatPopReturned.indexOf('.')); ?
[07:38:57] <BillCriswell> Ehh, I bet that can get nasty.
[07:39:08] <Cork> don't think so
[07:41:20] <Cork> BillCriswell: btw have you seen this http://jsfiddle.net/54xvmymg/ :D
[07:42:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'm not smart enough to appreciate what's going on here haha.
[07:42:20] <BillCriswell> What's going on exactly?
[07:42:33] <Cork> it fetches the ip of your computer :)
[07:42:52] <Cork> though webrtc
[07:43:08] <lilsammy_> is there a way you could alter the background-position on scrolling? I have this website I am building: http://www.veruspetroleum.com/build/ and want to make the background images move slightly
[07:43:21] <Kingsy> BillCriswell: that worked perfectly!
[07:43:27] <lilsammy_> but only fractionally so its noticeable but doesn't move much.
[07:43:31] <Cork> lilsammy_: sure
[07:43:53] <Cork> lilsammy_: you can either set the background-position from a scroll event
[07:43:53] <lilsammy_> Had issues animating the position of a background before
[07:44:04] <Cork> or you can change the scrolling area
[07:44:26] <lilsammy_> For paralax is it possible to use "cover" sized images as I have
[07:44:53] <Cork> ?g mdn background attachement
[07:44:57] <b-ot> Cork: background-attachment - CSS | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment
[07:45:48] <BillCriswell> Cork: Nice.
[07:46:17] <decx> never had problems animating background position
[07:48:24] <Cork> weee
[08:16:53] <lilsammy_> Trying to use a waypoints plugin with Jquery 1.11.1 and its breaking everything is there a method for waypoints in 1.11.1?
[08:17:22] <BillCriswell> lilsammy_: "breaking everything" isn't specific enough. Any errors?
[08:17:50] <lilsammy_> Well no theres no errors if I include the script in the footer but its stopping all my jquery working properly.
[08:18:14] <lilsammy_> there should be like 5 pages loaded via ajax an they stop loading with no error when the script is included
[08:18:21] <lilsammy_> but no errors :/
[08:18:48] <BillCriswell> You'd need to provide a link or replicate it somewhere.
[08:19:29] <lilsammy_> yeah I will try replicating it pain in the ass wordpress is probably doing somthing thats causing it
[08:25:55] <Absolute0> It seems like pressing alt stops $.keypress from working.
[08:26:19] <krambiorix> hi, can i catch the event when any dialog has been opened ?
[08:26:37] <krambiorix> I have multiple dialogs but i'm looking for one handler
[08:27:22] <soahccc> I'm using tocify and it works for the most part but could one tell me why, on some pages, the TOC isn't automatically expanding (it does after scrolling)? Here's an example that doesn't auto extend for me https://mcl.breitzeit.de/handlers/custom
[08:30:33] <krambiorix> anyone?
[08:31:06] <MikeD_> krambiorix: are you trying to catch your own dialogs or any, including code you injected
[08:32:29] <krambiorix> MikeD_, all my own
[08:32:55] <MikeD_> then write a wrapper for those those calls?
[08:33:40] <krambiorix> MikeD_, so there is no global thingy?
[08:34:05] <MikeD_> heh, oh... you want a global thingy?  sure.
[08:34:32] <krambiorix> MikeD_, something like $('body').onOpeningAnyDialog(....)
[08:35:02] <MikeD_> including print and such?
[08:35:14] <krambiorix> MikeD_, nope, just on open :)
[08:35:36] <krambiorix> MikeD_, i want to catch the event when a dialog is opened
[08:36:10] <robertmaxrees> there is no event thrown for that.
[08:36:13] <robertmaxrees> afaik
[08:36:37] <krambiorix> so ok, in every dialog.open i'll have to write a call then
[08:36:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code to suggest a better way.
[08:37:04] <robertmaxrees> you could write an event listener for a custom event that you could then trigger.
[08:37:16] <robertmaxrees> or you could write an intermediary for the dialog open that also runs your other logic.
[08:37:40] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i'd go for the custom event
[08:37:53] <robertmaxrees> you can use .trigger() to fire any event you want.
[08:38:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this).trigger('myButt');  $('dialog').on('myButt', function() {});
[08:38:46] <krambiorix> lol
[08:39:04] <robertmaxrees> that event should bubble and everything, too, though I'd still avoid doing custom events if you can get away with it.
[08:39:49] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, what should i put in $('dialog') ?
[08:40:12] <robertmaxrees> the selector for the elements that'd trigger a dialog to open.
[08:40:50] <robertmaxrees> hence why the extra event doesn't make sense ;)
[08:41:53] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, ok , i'll just call a function on opening the dialog :)
[08:42:05] <robertmaxrees> good :D that's the better way to do it.
[08:48:24] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, thanks!!
[08:48:36] <robertmaxrees> def
[08:57:10] <wodim> hello, how do i potato?
[08:57:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:58:48] <MikeD_> wodim: you need root access
[08:58:59] <robertmaxrees> *rimshot*
[08:59:12] <robertmaxrees> also make sure your caret is properly positioned
[09:04:52] <Respek> hi all, anyone know of a good resource for when to *avoid* using jquery? I learned about the .each gotcha (way slower than vanillla js loop), and I'm curious to learn more
[09:05:14] <robertmaxrees> Respek kind of depends.
[09:05:29] <Respek> robertmaxrees: hi :), how so?
[09:05:47] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need the features it provides.  if you're using it simply for the selectors, you might not need it.
[09:05:51] <robertmaxrees> http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
[09:06:41] <MikeD_> blasphemy
[09:06:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:06:55] <robertmaxrees> leave it to a #jquery room mod to point that out.
[09:08:05] <MikeD_> i like how the "oldest version of IE you need to support" only goes to 8
[09:08:35] <MikeD_> because older than that and you have a different problem than mere browser compatibility
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:08:57] <robertmaxrees> or you make a lot of money ;)
[09:10:01] <Respek> well, this link just shows alternatives, but not particularly why it might be a good idea. I'm curious about optimization, how might I learn when not to use jquery, due to efficiency issues.
[09:10:25] <robertmaxrees> ah, don't worry about that bit too much up front.
[09:10:31] <robertmaxrees> don't prematurely optimize.
[09:10:54] <MikeD_> i'd say the general rule about optimization is that doing so before you have a problem that warrants is will be a wasted effort
[09:11:03] <robertmaxrees> focus one writing clean, concise code that shows good separations of concern.  worry about performance if it becomes an issue.
[09:11:26] <MikeD_> hehe, "stereo"
[09:11:56] <robertmaxrees> there are some gotchas to be aware of - $.fn.each() is much slower than native for loops, but nobody will notice the difference until you get to really big sets of elements.
[09:12:54] <robertmaxrees> also, there are ways to use jquery that can be pretty performant.  leveraging document fragments is a great idea, for instance.
[09:13:13] <MikeD_> at the sizes big enough to make you ask if .each() vs for() loop makes sense, the answer is - request less data in the first place :)
[09:13:38] <robertmaxrees> *if possibe
[09:13:58] <MikeD_> leave all the number crunching in the cloud whenever possible... google/amazon/etc have way more resource than my browser
[09:14:00] <decx> eh, while is better than both ^^
[09:14:07] <robertmaxrees> document fragments exist in the vanilla DOM API, but they're kind of funky to grok.  the jquery version is stupid simple.
[09:14:37] <robertmaxrees> Respek so it's one of those "it depends on the project" things.
[09:14:46] <Respek> makes sense
[09:14:59] <MikeD_> oh yeah, we were answering a question
[09:15:07] <Respek> as always thanks for being a tome of knowledge :)
[09:18:42] <robertmaxrees> fshosho.  that's why we're here.
[09:19:24] <decx> what does aretha franklin mean with "sock it to me" anyway
[09:20:03] <robertmaxrees> it's an old american slang term with underlying sexual innuedo.
[09:20:21] <decx> ah that's what i thought
[09:21:01] <robertmaxrees> probably using the version of the word "sock" to mean "hit", as in "hit me".  rolls of the tongue well, blah blah blah.
[09:23:25] <Respek> decx: apparently originated from Mr. Mark Twain.
[09:37:01] <diverdude> Anybody knows a good double slider? Ie a slider that has 2 handles, like min/max handles
[09:37:14] <robertmaxrees> nouislider can do that.
[09:42:07] <axilla> hi all, how can I check if the next element after an h5 element is a p tag.. and if not remove the h5 element
[09:42:52] <robertmaxrees> axilla check out http://api.jquery.com/next/
[09:43:09] <axilla> thx
[09:47:22] <BillCriswell> $('h5').each(function(){ var $h5 = $(this); if (!$h5.next().is('p')) { $h5.remove(); });
[09:47:29] <BillCriswell> Oops, didn't scrolllllllll.
[09:48:27] <decx> i like short circuit for this stuff
[09:48:44] <decx> $h5.next('p').length || $h5.remove()
[09:49:08] <wunz> BillCriswell: whats the diff between var $h5 vs var h5 ?
[09:49:19] <decx> purely decorative
[09:49:22] <BillCriswell> wunz: Nothing.
[09:49:27] <wunz> ok
[09:49:51] <wunz> what is the preferred declaration?
[09:50:08] <BillCriswell> wunz: The one you want to use?
[09:50:12] <wunz> ;p
[09:50:57] <Bhiughy> whatmeanswhenIget NaN injquery
[09:51:20] <decx> it's a hardware notice meaning your spacebar is broken
[09:51:39] <wunz> Bhiughy: not a number?
[09:51:53] <Bhiughy> yes something happen with myspacebar
[09:51:55] <Bhiughy> shit!!
[09:52:05] <Bhiughy> means what isn't a number?
[09:52:48] <wunz> i was thinking of the isNaN fn()
[09:57:01] <mrcloud> hello. Im using this code http://pastebin.com/KPtHNV2W to move to specific sections on click. I also have a button (round-button) to go back to top onclick. The problem is that when I click this button, the scrollbar moves a little, go back to previous position and after that starts the animation to go to the top. How can I solve this?
[09:58:36] <wunz> first thing you should've done is jsfiddle it ;p
[10:00:25] <wunz> mrcloud: i would store the current scrollbar location and then restore that location after your animation
[10:00:48] <robertmaxrees> mrcloud btw you don't have to return anything from functions.
[10:00:48] <mrcloud> wunz: Ill try
[10:01:04] <mrcloud> robertmaxrees: mmm, ok, Ill try that first. I didn't know
[10:01:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm pointing out sometheing unrelated.
[10:01:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a bonus for you ;)
[10:02:06] <robertmaxrees> in your first click handler, you're returning true - absolutely unnecessary.  in your second handler, you're returining false - instead, pass the event object and run preventDefault() on it - .click(function(e) { e.preventDefault();
[10:20:14] <Sagar> hello
[10:20:58] <Sagar> i am trying to make a scroll function when my navigation touch the window top it should change it css property position to fixed and when back scroll it should change to absolute it works fine. http://jsbin.com/gisupubumepo/1/edit
[10:21:09] <Sagar> but when i put up change of color, it is creating me a problem, please check
[10:22:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/bisozeqovebo/1/edit with indentation fixed up.
[10:24:40] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/bisozeqovebo/1/edit
[10:25:06] <Sagar> its creating problem switching colors when scrolled back
[10:28:12] <Sagar> robertmaxrees???
[10:35:46] <robertmaxrees> sorry busy gimme a few.
[10:35:57] <Sagar> ok am waiting..
[10:37:56] <robertmaxrees> where are you changing the color back?
[10:38:18] <robertmaxrees> i see you changing the color in one direction, but not the other.
[10:38:51] <Sagar> http://jsbin.com/nukemi/1/edit
[10:38:52] <Sagar> check this
[10:41:31] <robertmaxrees> sec
[10:42:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, works as espected.  the issue you're seeing animation queues vs the scroll evemn
[10:42:13] <robertmaxrees> *event
[10:42:31] <Sagar> can u please modify the source and solve it?
[10:42:59] <robertmaxrees> check out using .stop() against the element in question to stop all animations and run your own instead.
[10:43:14] <robertmaxrees> also, cache your navigation selector, and consider using css transitions instead.
[10:43:24] <robertmaxrees> add/remove classes instead of changing css properties manually.
[10:44:27] <Sagar> i am some new to this, please modify the source and help me thanks :)
[10:44:33] <robertmaxrees> we don't work like that here.
[10:44:35] <robertmaxrees> we help you learn.
[10:44:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of giving you the code :)
[10:44:55] <robertmaxrees> which part of this are you having trouble understanding?
[10:45:07] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:45:08] <Sagar> no i mean just modify the code and make it work. i will see what i was not doing right and it will solve my problem to + i will learn
[10:45:15] <Sagar> :)
[10:45:20] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[10:45:32] <robertmaxrees> i will not "just modify" your code.
[10:45:39] <robertmaxrees> i'll help you figure it out though
[10:46:14] <Sagar> :x
[10:46:35] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/stop/ check this out :)
[10:47:11] <pushpa> Hi, stuck a little bit with .slideToggle()  ... Having a loop with several div elements so using classes ( $('.trigger').click(function()   )  ...  My problem is, that when I do not place the Toggle class right after the Trigger class it wont work and slide. Question ... What do I need to do to be able to place the class elsewhere?   Code:   https://dpaste.de/YFcp
[10:48:35] <Sagar> rovertmaxress? what should i do?
[10:48:56] <Cork> pushpa: please make a demo of the effect on something like jsfiddle or jsbin
[10:48:59] <robertmaxrees> Sagar use .stop() on the navigation to stop the animation from running before you apply the new styles.
[10:49:41] <Sagar> you mean 		$(".navigation").stop({ backgroundColor: "blue" }, 1200);
[10:49:44] <Sagar> ?
[10:49:46] <robertmaxrees> Sagar no.
[10:49:53] <Sagar> then
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> .stop().animation()
[10:50:03] <robertmaxrees> the documentation teaches you how to do this.
[10:50:42] <dnyy> what is the difference here? http://cl.ly/image/15332F2f2K1m
[10:50:56] <Sagar> robertmaxrees: still didnt get u
[10:50:57] <Sagar> :(
[10:51:10] <dnyy> the first one works, the second one doesn't (for backbonejs/templates/yadda)
[10:51:14] <robertmaxrees> Sagar literally put .stop() before your .animation call
[10:51:15] <dnyy> no idea wh
[10:51:17] <dnyy> y
[10:51:22] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ dnyy
[10:51:22] <b-ot> dnyy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:51:52] <Sagar> 1) i dont have animation, i have animate
[10:51:55] <Sagar> 2) >> 		$(".navigation").stop.animate({  backgroundColor: "blue" }, 1200);
[10:52:02] <dnyy> didn't seem useful to paste, but ok https://gist.github.com/dannytatom/ffd441bf464a4c60ebe4 lol
[10:52:04] <Cork> dnyy: please don't ask ppl to debug images
[10:52:14] <Cork> dnyy: make a live example of the problem
[10:52:22] <Cork> so ppl can see the effect you have problem with
[10:52:27] <robertmaxrees> Sagar that's what I mean by "animation" - a call to .animate.
[10:52:32] <robertmaxrees> and again, use .stop(), not .stop
[10:52:42] <dnyy> right, or you could look at the image and realize it's not a picture of code that i need debugged
[10:53:04] <robertmaxrees> dnyy what are you doing to get these?
[10:53:08] <robertmaxrees> that's what we need to know.
[10:53:12] <Cork> dnyy: its a picture of a object, array or dom element
[10:53:13] <robertmaxrees> you're giving us very little context to go off of.
[10:53:16] <Cork> so it is basically the same thing
[10:53:52] <dnyy> i mean i can figure out the why/who/what, all i'm asking is why the difference? are they both jQuery objects, is one something else? one has the element listed, the other doesn't.
[10:54:06] <robertmaxrees> dnyy how are you getting these?
[10:54:13] <robertmaxrees> that's the code i was asking for.
[10:54:17] <dnyy> first is a normal $('foo')
[10:54:19] <Sagar> robertmaxress: http://jsbin.com/nukemi/2/edit
[10:54:25] <dnyy> the other is $('foo').find('.' + 'thing')
[10:54:32] <Sagar> still same
[10:54:44] <robertmaxrees> Sagar you haven't included jquery or jqueryui on that fiddle.
[10:54:59] <robertmaxrees> Sagar http://jsbin.com/yeforuyezemi/1/edit
[10:55:17] <robertmaxrees> dnyy those should be the exact same.
[10:55:27] <dnyy> right, which is the issue i'm trying to figure out
[10:55:28] <robertmaxrees> they're both jquery objects i mean.
[10:55:33] <dnyy> it's probably something to do with backbone
[10:55:52] <dnyy> i just wasn't sure if the objects returned were the same or different (they look slightly different, one having div.foo and the other not)
[10:56:15] <robertmaxrees> they both inherit from jquery, so in use it should be fine.
[10:56:25] <dnyy> fa sho, thanks
[10:56:47] <Sagar> robertmaxress: even when .navigation doesn't touch up the window top head, it changes color to blue, all i want is it should change color when touch the windows top to yellow and if it's on its back position should go to back to blue color
[10:57:15] <robertmaxrees> Sagar great - you got one direction working when you include jquery AND jquery-ui
[10:57:21] <robertmaxrees> now you just fix the other.
[10:57:30] <robertmaxrees> btw you have to include jqueri-ui or a plugin for color animations.
[10:57:34] <robertmaxrees> core jquery can't do that for you.
[10:57:43] <Sagar> yeah, i have it included on my local server
[10:57:48] <Sagar> but forgot to add it on jsbin. sorry
[10:58:05] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle works scrolling down.  add the .stop() call for the other direction and you're good to go.
[11:00:21] <Sagar> robertmaxress: http://jsfiddle.net/4yrftxxo/
[11:01:40] <robertmaxrees> in jsfiddle don't include things like that btw - use the menu in the upper left: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4yrftxxo/1/
[11:03:00] <Sagar> still the sa,e
[11:03:02] <Sagar> same*
[11:03:07] <robertmaxrees> it's working for me.
[11:03:10] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[11:03:14] <robertmaxrees> any errors in your console?
[11:03:20] <Sagar> nope
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a .stop() in there still.
[11:03:42] <robertmaxrees> you need it before each .animate()
[11:04:35] <robertmaxrees> the problem is animations get pushed into a queue, and the way your code is written, it's calling animate even if it doesn't need to, once for every time the scroll event happens.
[11:05:01] <Sagar> so i have to call the stop before each animation
[11:05:02] <robertmaxrees> which can be dozens of times.  it then runs the animation for one color over and over, then the queue hits the other color, etc.
[11:05:04] <Sagar> let me try
[11:05:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[11:05:41] <robertmaxrees> the other fix is to cache the scrollheight and only run the animation if you went from one threshold to another, instead of just checking the current y position.
[11:05:51] <Sagar> even if i move the scroll slightly, it changes the color to blue, it should only change it when touched the win head
[11:05:54] <robertmaxrees> or use css transitions.
[11:06:07] <robertmaxrees> then your scroll position comparisons are off.
[11:07:34] <Sagar> well works fine now
[11:07:38] <Sagar> made a clear cache
[11:07:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4yrftxxo/2/
[11:07:46] <robertmaxrees> also, cache your .navigation selector.
[11:08:14] <Sagar> how to cache that?
[11:08:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4yrftxxo/3/
[11:08:46] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[11:08:52] <robertmaxrees> var $navigation = $(".navigation"),
[11:09:01] <robertmaxrees> outside of the event handler
[11:09:12] <robertmaxrees> same with that height var.  no need to recalculate that every time the page scrolls
[11:12:53] <Sagar> robertmaxress: why u using 	var y_scroll_pos = window.scrollTop(); not window.pageYOffset;
[11:14:12] <robertmaxrees> pageYOffset doesn't work in ie 8 and below.
[11:39:39] <stack> hi, why does $(document).on('DOMNodeInserted',  ':file', ... doesn't fire when I insert an element that contains a input:file ? is there something to listen on dom insertion and update them in case they match a selector?
[11:41:10] <robertmaxrees> stack don't listen to those events.  call the function you want explicitly instead.
[11:41:24] <robertmaxrees> and technically, the file wouldn't emit the event anyway.,
[11:42:38] <Sagar> see yaa
[11:42:41] <Sagar> n thnx
[11:42:48] <stack> robertmaxrees: why not listening?
[11:42:55] <stack> is that too heavy?
[11:43:33] <robertmaxrees> because you can easily create infinite loops if you're not carefuly, and they're really slow.
[11:43:54] <stack> robertmaxrees: btw in case I insert with $('body').append("<input type='file' >"); the event fires
[11:44:06] <robertmaxrees> they're also inconsistently implemented.
[11:44:12] <robertmaxrees> so cross-browser becomes a nightmare.
[11:44:16] <stack> robertmaxrees: ok
[11:44:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Mutation_events
[11:44:37] <robertmaxrees> mutation observers could be used, too, but I'd still avoid it if you could.
[11:44:41] <robertmaxrees> explicitly call the logic you want instead.
[11:45:05] <stack> robertmaxrees: I'll, thanks

[11:57:06] <naomi> hello peoples !
[11:57:37] <naomi> i would like to present an interesting thing to everyone
[11:57:46] <naomi> a little quiz !
[11:57:52] <naomi> no cheating now
[11:58:12] <naomi> what do you suppose is the output of this: $("<p>one</p><p>two</p>").map(function() { return [1,2,3]; }).get();
[11:59:21] <naomi> one might guess that the output is [ [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3] ]
[11:59:24] <naomi> BUT NO
[11:59:29] <naomi> try again !
[11:59:31] <dcherman> naomi: a jquery object containing two entries which are those arrays.
[11:59:45] <naomi> dcherman heheh that's what I expected too !
[11:59:55] <naomi> the output is very perplexing though !
[12:00:03] <naomi> the actual result is [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
[12:00:15] <naomi> somehow .map is flattening the arrays !
[12:00:36] <decx> you do return [[]]
[12:00:40] <decx> for unflat
[12:01:02] <naomi> decx that's where i was going next
[12:01:10] <naomi> i was just curious why the default behavior was to flatten though
[12:02:59] <naomi> here's yet another interesting demonstration !
[12:03:04] <naomi> $("<p>one</p><p>two</p>").map(function() { return null; }).get();
[12:03:09] <naomi> what do we suppose the output of this is ?
[12:03:17] <naomi> c'mon guys, no cheating
[12:04:03] <NoiseEee> isn't that the same kind of case naomi?
[12:04:12] <naomi> NoiseEee nope !
[12:04:16] <NoiseEee> btw i like your name, my daughter has the same and turns 4 tomorrow
[12:04:21] <naomi> <3
[12:04:36] <naomi> in this case, .map will return []
[12:04:38] <naomi> an empty array !
[12:04:41] <naomi> who would've thought !
[12:04:51] <naomi> .map is automatically .filter-ing results too !
[12:04:57] <naomi> strange, i think
[12:05:10] <naomi> if you want the nulls, you can `return [null];`
[12:05:21] <naomi> $("<p>one</p><p>two</p>").map(function() { return [null]; }).get(); // [null, null]
[12:05:26] <naomi> hmm, very perplexing API indeed !
[12:05:51] <NoiseEee> The function can return: null¬†or¬†undefined, to remove the item
[12:05:51] <naomi> how about this one guys
[12:05:56] <NoiseEee> naomi: from the man page
[12:06:01] <naomi> $("<p>one</p><p>two</p>").map(function() { return false; }).get();
[12:06:10] <naomi> should we expect [false, false] or [] ?
[12:06:59] <NoiseEee> well that case is more like the first
[12:07:02] <robertmaxrees> the former
[12:07:12] <NoiseEee> but the api docs describe what you see with null as intentional
[12:07:38] <naomi> yeah, i see that it's documented now
[12:07:39] <NoiseEee> but i agree, $.map is sometimes not doing what you'd expect if you're familiar with array.prototype.map
[12:07:47] * naomi nods
[12:07:54] <robertmaxrees> the reason for that is largely historical isn't it?
[12:08:07] * NoiseEee shrugs
[12:08:08] <naomi> i'm just pointing these things out because they were very surprising finds to me
[12:08:16] <naomi> and i'm not a jquery/javascript noob by any measure
[12:08:30] <NoiseEee> yeah fair enough naomi, i've been burned by it before as well
[12:08:31] <robertmaxrees> iirc jquery had a .map() before there was one in core js.
[12:08:38] <robertmaxrees> it can be a little confusing at times for sur.e
[12:08:46] <naomi> i'm not saying they're not useful, fwiw
[12:09:10] <naomi> one thing i can say for sure though
[12:09:21] <naomi> i'm very scared to see what the code looks like behind the scenes
[12:09:37] <naomi> one function that maps, filters, and optionally flattens !
[12:09:39] <naomi> all in one !
[12:10:03] <robertmaxrees> lol you can look for yourself on github.
[12:10:10] <robertmaxrees> it'
[12:10:43] <robertmaxrees> *it's not all that terrible.  something tells me there's be another backwarads-compatibility breaking api change at some point to clean it up, though.
[12:11:24] <naomi> robertmaxrees yeah, i read the jquery code almost daily
[12:11:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm rarely in the source these days.
[12:11:45] <naomi> well, daily as of late
[12:11:53] <naomi> i hsouldn't say i've read it daily for the last 5 years or something lol
[12:12:01] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[12:51:23] <naeluh_FRIDAY> hey can some explain why this only returning 0 for my table to json function I am trying to return a json array of each column with the new names and for some reason I cant get to cycle through all 22 columns ? only 0 http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/1/
[12:53:24] <t432> in.array returns -1 even when the string match (according to console log), what could be the problem?
[12:53:56] <naomi> ggguhh this code ..
[12:54:25] <naomi> naeluh_FRIDAY please show me what you want the output to look like
[12:55:27] <naomi> you want [{hole: 1, black: 504, blue: 491, par: 5, white: 458, red: 441}, {hole: 2, ... }, {hole: 3, ...}, ... ] ?
[12:55:31] <mdev> I have a var test = []; how can I set its .data values
[12:55:53] <mdev> like test.data[0,3] been failing miserably every way I try
[12:56:16] <naomi> mdev test should be {} then, not []
[12:56:59] <naeluh_FRIDAY> naomi: I want to return a json array that is set up in the code
[12:57:12] <naeluh_FRIDAY> do you the array being built in there
[12:58:24] <t432> A response, a response. My kingdom for a response!
[12:59:51] <P_R_Delt0id> I'm having an issue with Jquery-UI, where using any of it's functions (I am trying to create a tooltip) causes the error "undefined is not a function". I checked all the required scripts are included in the <head> of my page. jQuery core functions all work correctly, too.  I'm just having this issue with jQuery-UI
[13:00:19] <MikeD_> t432: response.
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id are you trying to use them before jquery/jquery ui are included?
[13:00:53] <robertmaxrees> any other errors in the page?>
[13:01:03] <t432> Thats cheating!
[13:01:13] <P_R_Delt0id> No other errors being shown. I am using them in a JS file that only runs after the DOM has completed loaded (using window.onload =)
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id i'd have to see the code then.
[13:01:36] <robertmaxrees> could you setup a fiddle?
[13:01:41] <t432> nobody has any idea?
[13:01:45] <P_R_Delt0id> Sure, but the problem is it's literally just one line
[13:01:52] <MikeD_> fiddle?
[13:01:56] <t432> aha
[13:02:01] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id i can't see what you have, so a jsfiddle would be awesome
[13:02:01] <t432> fiddle is in order.
[13:02:21] <P_R_Delt0id> Let me set one up one sec
[13:10:47] <P_R_Delt0id> I don't think fiddle is going to work. The JS requests some info from a PHP file, and I am getting a Same Origin error. I could show you the page, if that would help? It's probably a conflict issue anyways with a million other included libraries, so seeing the actual page would probably be more helpful than a tiny example.
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> sure, that works in this ca.se.
[13:12:56] <mdev> http://pastebin.com/sBqwYHqK
[13:12:58] <mdev> please help
[13:13:08] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id please send it to the channel.
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> mdev you need an extra array.
[13:14:06] <P_R_Delt0id> Ok, sure. http://www.sspca.org/adopt/meet-adoptable-pets/viewanimal/22122723/ The file where the error occurs is "view_animal.js," in the function view_animal, near the end. It reads "jQuery('sup').tooltip();
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> mdev so graph1.data = [[]], and then do graph1.data[0].push(7)
[13:14:38] <P_R_Delt0id> The website is built on Wordpress, and the files are included using the Enqueue_scripts function, which appears to have included them correctly in the <head> element
[13:15:48] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id fix up that .button() error first.  that might be causing other things to fail on the page/.
[13:16:14] <P_R_Delt0id> Oh, sorry. I changed it to button. That is the line that is failing and I need to fix
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> also, it looks like you only have jquery ui core included and not anything you need for the actual tooltip.
[13:17:00] <P_R_Delt0id> I was just testing other functions to see if 'tooltip()' was failing, or if the entire jquery-ui core was failing. I also tried a jquery-core function, .fadeout(), which worked and didn't throw any errors
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> change your jqui build.
[13:17:21] <P_R_Delt0id> I can see the jquery-ui-widget and jquery-ui-position, which is what the API page says it requires. You do not see those?
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your jqui build doesn't have everything it needs. bad build.
[13:17:30] <mdev> thanks!
[13:17:30] <P_R_Delt0id> The version, you mean?
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> i see them, but they're obviously not everything you need.
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean the dependencies.
[13:18:30] <P_R_Delt0id> What else does it require? The API page (http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/) says those are all it needs
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> it says you need core, widget, position, and effects
[13:19:42] <sahbeewah> naeluh_FRIDAY: http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/3/
[13:19:43] <P_R_Delt0id> Effects lists as optional for the more advanced stuff. I want a standard tooltip.
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id dunno what to tell you - try using a more fleshed out build instea.d
[13:20:35] <P_R_Delt0id> Like, include more UI stuff and see if it fixes it?
[13:20:46] <robertmaxrees> try a full, non-custom ui build, yeah.
[13:20:50] <mdev> says Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined
[13:20:59] <mdev> when I try graph1.data[0].push(50);
[13:21:02] <robertmaxrees> mdev make a fiddle
[13:21:06] <naeluh_FRIDAY> sahbeewah: ahh row, tr nice thanks
[13:22:43] <sahbeewah> naeluh_FRIDAY: note the TableData[i] vs TableData[row] as well
[13:23:03] <naomi> naeluh_FRIDAY i dunno try this i guess http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/4/
[13:23:50] <P_R_Delt0id> I needed to include jquery-ui-tooltip. I thought it would work with just the core. Thanks, robertmaxrees
[13:24:08] <naomi> naeluh_FRIDAY small update here: http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/5/
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> hah, P_R_Delt0id are you grabbing the modules, or building individual versions of jqui btw?
[13:25:12] <naeluh_FRIDAY> naomi and sahbeewah wow thanks thats awesome
[13:26:16] <P_R_Delt0id> Grabbing modules, I'm guessing. I use Wordpress' enqueue_scripts function, and list the individual modules as dependencies for the view_animal.js file
[13:26:45] <naomi> naeluh_FRIDAY this is _slightly_ more simple too http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/6/
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id where are you getting those files from though?
[13:29:42] <P_R_Delt0id> Wordpress includes them.
[13:29:58] <P_R_Delt0id> http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#Default_Scripts_Included_and_Registered_by_WordPress
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> P_R_Delt0id weird
[13:31:49] <naomi> naeluh_FRIDAY here's one more improvement http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/7/
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i don't know anything about wordpress, which i s why i was so confused.
[13:31:58] <naomi> oh that leech left ...
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:32:34] <naomi> stupid double var call removed: http://jsfiddle.net/wcdfp7Ls/8/
[13:32:36] <naomi> done working on this
[13:32:37] <naomi> lol
[13:35:29] <nebby> Hello, I am new to jquery, I have this in my code: http://pastebin.com/CyFVnMCA I am trying to write a function to be able to pass arguments to easily do the same operation 3 times on different selectors, but I can't figure out how?
[13:35:29] <nebby> http://pastebin.com/CyFVnMCA
[13:35:40] <nebby> oops, sorry for double paste link
[13:38:17] <sahbeewah> nebby: are you able to change the html data structure?
[13:38:23] <prtksxna> nebby: $('.class1, .class2').css(‚Ä¶)
[13:41:09] <robertmaxrees> nebby use .each()
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> and give a common class to the elements you're operating against.
[13:54:00] <sniperh4x0r> anyone know how to make this have a fade in effect? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GvDFt
[13:54:19] <sniperh4x0r> i'm reading the magnific popup documentation and i don't know what to put in the callback to make it fade in
[13:54:20] <nebby> sahbeewah: yes
[13:54:36] <nebby> prtksxna: I can't do that, the stuff I do to them is different
[13:54:44] <nebby> ig, I set classa1 to classb1 size
[13:54:46] <nebby> eg*
[13:56:56] <nebby> .each() looks like it could work
[13:58:37] <sniperh4x0r> nevermind dont answer my question i
[13:58:41] <sniperh4x0r> m heading out for the day
[13:58:44] <sniperh4x0r> l8r
[14:01:55] <sahbeewah> nebby: you‚Äôre gonna wanna change all your imgoverN classes to imgover and imgoutN classes to imgout
[14:02:21] <sahbeewah> then yeah, loop through the image containers and apply the css
[14:37:11] <ronin> OK $(selector) returns "array" of the elements, how can I print the elements for debugging purposes
[14:50:50] <xp_prg> I have this: Object {0: "1293", 1: "1301", 2: "1298", 3: "1296", 13: "1314", 14: "1305", 15: "1307", 16: "1309", 17: "1311", 18: "1392"}  I want to search if 1292 is in this structure, I tried $.inArray but it didn't work, I don't think it worked because this is not an array
[14:50:55] <xp_prg> any ideas how I do this?
[14:56:18] <naomi> xp_prg ("1292" in obj) //=> will return true/false
[14:56:32] <naomi> oh sorry, you want to search the values
[14:57:32] <xp_prg> I want to know if it is in that list
[14:58:00] <naomi> you could do $.map(obj, function(val) { return val; }).indexOf("1292");
[14:58:05] <naomi> but there might be a better way than that, xp_prg
[14:58:11] <naomi> at the moment, that's the best i can come up with
[14:58:24] <xp_prg> I heart you naomi
[15:00:08] <naomi> xp_prg, note that when using .indexOf, you will want to check if the value is -1
[15:00:11] <naomi> -1 means it was not found
[15:00:21] <naomi> xp_prg, 0 means it was found as the first element
[15:00:25] <xp_prg> yup thanks
[15:00:30] <naomi> xp_prg 1 was found as the second element, etc
[15:00:50] <naomi> $.map(obj, function(val) { return val; }).indexOf("1292") !== -1
[15:00:53] <naomi> also um
[15:00:57] <naomi> i'm not sure about type
[15:01:05] <naomi> "1292" !== 1292
[15:01:08] <naomi> (string vs int)
[15:01:16] <naomi> so make sure you specify those properly :)
[15:02:18] <roninn> OK $(selector) returns "array" of the elements, how can I print the elements for debugging purposes
[15:02:31] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(selector));
[15:02:33] <roninn> thanks
[15:02:42] <roninn> I didnt know it takes an array
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> it's not a true array
[15:02:51] <robertmaxrees> it's array-like
[15:02:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log() takes anything, though.
[15:03:05] <robertmaxrees> you can browse the object and stuff.
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> pretty cool.
[15:04:15] <naomi> roninn console.dir($(selector)) is also pretty useful
[15:04:40] <naomi> sometimes more type information is presented with console.dir
[15:35:01] <wa5ted> grafi: yo
[16:52:51] <P0RK_> If I  have a radio button with a label, what is the easiest way to select the label from the button's click handler?
[16:54:57] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: What does the html look like?
[16:55:01] <P0RK_> $(this).parent().find("label").filter(function() {return ($(this).prop("for")==var?$(this):null);}).first();
[16:55:26] <P0RK_> Surely you have seen labels and inputs. before. They can come before or after (or even labels can wrap inputs)
[16:55:57] <BillCriswell> Yes, but what does your html look like?
[16:56:04] <P0RK_> It depends on the need. I was hoping to find a way to select the labels without relying on their markup stuyle
[16:56:07] <P0RK_> I have them all three ways
[16:59:19] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: You could check the length on .parent('label'), .next('label') and .before('label') length and react accordingly, but it seems like an awful waste of time.
[17:00:02] <BillCriswell> If you know the container of everything's name you can do $input.closest('.some-wrapper').find('label')
[17:02:02] <P0RK_> to deselect a radio button do you have to do $("input:radio:selected").removeAttr("selected");
[17:02:49] <BillCriswell> .prop('selected', false); probably.
[17:04:31] <BillCriswell> Actually ou want :checked
[17:05:03] <BillCriswell> and .prop('checked', false);
[17:05:36] <P0RK_> I though checked was for checkboxes and selected was for radio buttons
[17:06:45] <BillCriswell> Nope. Selected would be for a selected option in a select element.
[17:07:15] <P0RK_> very nice.
[17:07:32] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ropezuduzece/1/edit?html,js,output
[17:07:39] <P0RK_> I got it to work by handling the change event on the parent. Then just looking at all (2) labels/inputs to see which is selected
[17:08:34] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[17:09:48] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[17:10:10] <BillCriswell> weeeeee
[17:10:55] <P0RK_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mefb808c/5/
[17:11:02] <P0RK_> rough, but working.
[17:14:53] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: Sweet.
[17:16:33] <P0RK_> thnks. It looks a lot better with the web fonts loaded.I am sure there's a better way to handle the expanding fields though. Open to suggestions..
[17:23:04] <decx> you can bind relation between objects in data() on load so you dont have to do these lookups anytime
[17:23:20] <decx> everytime*
[17:23:21] <P0RK_> I wondered about that
[17:23:27] <BillCriswell> decx: I've done that before.
[17:23:29] <P0RK_> Kind of initialize them
[17:23:50] <BillCriswell> $foo.data('oroginalParent', $foo.parent());
[17:24:09] <decx> yeah or that for to id
[17:24:36] <decx> .data('partner',$partnerel)
[17:25:32] <decx> it doesnt really matter much if it's all ids anyway but if there's a bit of traversal everytime it's pretty good
[17:27:15] <paul_irish> hi
[17:27:20] <paul_irish> anyone in here use synchronous XHR?
[17:28:44] <P0RK_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mefb808c/10/
[17:29:09] <P0RK_> Does .data method somehow mess up the jqueryness of it's value?
[17:31:12] <robertWorkBeer> hrm?
[17:31:24] <robertWorkBeer> .data() edits a cached version of the object.
[17:31:44] <jphase> lol... "jqueryness"?
[17:31:48] <robertWorkBeer> (which is good since it's faster)
[17:33:23] <P0RK_> I wish there was a way to extend html elements to add elementclass specific methods to it. I would like $("label").input() to return it's input element...
[17:33:57] <robertWorkBeer> hah
[17:34:17] <robertWorkBeer> just wrap the label around the input, or set the label's for attribute.
[17:35:14] <P0RK_> That's easy. Now how do you go about selecting it without the convolutedness of $("#"+lbl.attr("for"));
[17:35:35] <paul_irish> I LOVE LABEL WRAPPING
[17:35:43] <robertWorkBeer> .prop() btw P0RK_
[17:35:44] <paul_irish> my friend paul hates it and prefers the for=""
[17:35:44] <P0RK_> and it's easy if you have the label
[17:35:57] <P0RK_> label wrapping doesn't work in some cases
[17:36:04] <robertWorkBeer> like when?
[17:36:20] <decx> for is nice for the input + label checkbox styling hack
[17:36:27] <paul_irish> like if you put a label in a table cell next to your input in another table cell
[17:36:34] <paul_irish> when you do table layout like a pro
[17:36:34] <P0RK_> I have had problems styling labels without affecting their radio button children
[17:36:57] <robertWorkBeer> we kind of manage to avoid those scenarios i guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[17:37:04] <robertWorkBeer> lol tables
[17:37:13] <paul_irish> are you drinking?
[17:37:32] <robertWorkBeer> yes.  my employer gives me beer in fridays.
[17:37:38] <paul_irish> what beer
[17:37:39] <P0RK_> I had a practical use case recently for tables. I spent two days undoing all the tableness and then got the message in #css, Oh, I'd use tables for this...
[17:37:40] <P0RK_> uggg.
[17:37:42] <jphase> label wrapping ftw
[17:37:54] <robertWorkBeer> today it was Old Chico Crystal Wheat.
[17:38:57] * Velveeta takes a pint glass out of his pocket.
[17:39:01] <BillCriswell> Hm, inspecting a label element and don't see a "for" property but I do see a "htmlFor".
[17:39:16] <robertWorkBeer> i have 3 pint glasses at my desk, all furnished by my employer.
[17:39:44] <robertWorkBeer> we do a lot of sierra nevada here since we're like 5 minutes away from the original brewery.
[17:39:55] <Velveeta> i have 2 at my own desk
[17:40:01] <jphase> yay! sierra nevada is good - the only beer that's decent where I live now :(
[17:40:03] <Velveeta> sounds like i need to find a 3rd one to heist, for parity
[17:40:15] <robertWorkBeer> jphase whereabouts you located?
[17:40:33] <jphase> Fort Lauderdale, FL - but I'm originally from Portland, Oregon - land of the microbrew
[17:40:59] <robertWorkBeer> oh man.  i remember getting a pale in florida after my honeymoon in the bahamas.  it was one of the best beers i'd ever had.
[17:41:38] <jphase> oh yeah? I just get sad when I go to a "pub" and they have 5 tap handles and 3 of them are bud, coors, and miller
[17:41:39] <Velveeta> this is my favorite time of year, because the oktoberfests are starting to emerge
[17:41:57] <robertWorkBeer> jphase we still get that here, too.
[17:42:11] <paul_irish> BillCriswell: it gets renamed as an attribute because `for` is a reserved word in JS
[17:42:22] <robertWorkBeer> also: natty ice (i think it was) used chico as a test market before their national release.
[17:42:26] <uskerine> hi, how can you detect SHIFT in a keyCode? I am trying to detect SHIFT+TAB, but I get keyCode 9 no matter if SHIFT is used or not. Any tip? Thanks
[17:42:39] <jphase> or how about "the beast" *cringe*
[17:42:39] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: Ah. Should have realized that.
[17:42:41] <robertWorkBeer> uskerine you have to detect shift and tab separately.
[17:42:51] <paul_irish> BillCriswell: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/prop.js#L22-L25
[17:42:55] <robertWorkBeer> detect the keydown of shift, then the keydown of tab
[17:43:02] <uskerine> robertWorkBeer, could you please elaborate a bit more on how can I detect shift separatelly?
[17:43:10] <paul_irish> jquery lets you do use 'for'  but it maps to htmlFor under the covers
[17:43:20] <paul_irish> WHO CAN U TRUST
[17:43:22] <robertWorkBeer> uskerine .on('keydown', function() { /* check keycodes in here */ });
[17:43:26] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: That sounds much sexier than behind the scenes.
[17:43:26] <robertWorkBeer> u bby
[17:43:29] <uskerine> I see
[17:43:32] <paul_irish> hahahaha
[17:43:42] <paul_irish> it does.
[17:43:47] <uskerine> isn't it possible to detect shift presence in "keypress" event?
[17:43:58] <robertWorkBeer> uskerine nope, because the keycode isn't changed.
[17:44:05] <paul_irish> http://unixpapa.com/js/testkey.html
[17:44:11] <uskerine> and, what is the different between keypress and keydown?
[17:44:20] <jphase> uskerine: .on('keydown', function(e) { console.log( e.shiftKey ); }
[17:44:24] <jphase> bah
[17:44:26] <paul_irish> no keypress for shift
[17:44:30] <jphase> forgot the )
[17:44:32] <paul_irish> but a keydown
[17:44:45] <paul_irish> uskerine: just read http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html
[17:44:48] <paul_irish> piece of cake
[17:44:50] <robertWorkBeer> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html or this.
[17:44:54] <Velveeta> nice, i never really thought about whether a shift/ctrl/etc key could be detected on their own
[17:44:55] <robertWorkBeer> lots of great content out there.
[17:44:59] <uskerine> thanks, I will do
[17:45:02] <Velveeta> but now i know... something something half the battle
[17:45:03] <paul_irish> however
[17:45:12] <paul_irish> people on phones are moving to swipe typing
[17:45:12] <robertWorkBeer> Velveeta and beer is half the battle?
[17:45:15] <jphase> oh touch√© - thx pual
[17:45:19] <jphase> paul* even
[17:45:22] <paul_irish> and Voice
[17:45:24] <Velveeta> the other half is 25% red and 25% blue lasers
[17:45:25] <paul_irish> so relying on letter-by-letter input will fuck you
[17:45:28] <jphase> bah... frickin' pain killers
[17:45:30] <paul_irish> oninput ftw
[17:45:40] <Velveeta> my costume just arrived via ups
[17:45:41] <robertWorkBeer> if you're developing for mobile.
[17:45:49] <paul_irish> robertWorkBeer: everyone is developing for mobile
[17:45:51] <robertWorkBeer> we have a totally different site for mobile so lol
[17:46:03] * jphase imagines Velveeta dressed up as....... a box of Velveeta
[17:46:07] <Velveeta> i won't be developing for mobile for another few months, once our infrastructure overhaul is finished
[17:46:17] <paul_irish> you guys are wimps
[17:46:25] <Velveeta> jphase: i'm going for 3 years straight as our office champ, i can't do it with a box of velveetta
[17:46:27] <Velveeta> -t
[17:46:28] <robertWorkBeer> hahaha, we're actually just testing a new frontend stack.
[17:46:38] <robertWorkBeer> since our mobile setup was turrible, we started there.
[17:46:43] <paul_irish> a frontend stack to serve a decreasingly smaller audience
[17:46:54] <robertWorkBeer> for now.  we're using coldfusion for desktop sooooo
[17:47:04] <paul_irish> GL
[17:47:14] <uberjar> Hi.  Is there an event I can bind to for when a checkbox has been either checked or unchecked ?  (not nescassarily due to a click)
[17:47:25] <jphase> yikes @ coldfusion :o
[17:47:42] <robertWorkBeer> needed a place to test out the abstractions and stuff we needed from our backend for data.  once we're pretty confident that we can move off we'll start the project to convert our desktop site to node, too.
[17:47:43] <jphase> uberjar: change is one of them
[17:48:07] <paul_irish> uberjar: change, babe.
[17:48:10] <uberjar> jphase: I'm trying to use change right now... and it seems to not fire when the checkbox was checked via javascript
[17:48:18] <robertWorkBeer> $('input').on('change', function() { $(this).prop('checked') }); bam
[17:48:23] <jphase> hmm orly?
[17:48:26] <jphase> it *should*
[17:48:28] <decx> trigger('change') when you set the prop
[17:48:32] <jphase> ohh duh
[17:48:33] <Velveeta> change is the only constant... along with any other constants you may define somewhere yourself..
[17:48:34] <jphase> ^
[17:48:40] <uberjar> trigger! that's what I needed
[17:48:43] <uberjar> thanks dude
[17:49:06] <paul_irish> needs moar data binding
[17:50:12] <jphase> so paul... how many star struck js nerds get excited when they see your name on irc? heh
[17:50:21] <Velveeta> i was one
[17:50:28] <P0RK_> <---- Me
[17:50:35] <Velveeta> you should've seen me on our #FEE skype channel that day
[17:50:58] <Velveeta> i called them all chumps and told them i quit because paul irish said my name so i can get hired anywhere
[17:51:05] <robertWorkBeer> hahahaha
[17:51:07] <jphase> lol
[17:51:13] <Velveeta> then i thought better of those words and pulled out the #oppositeDay modifier
[17:51:24] <Velveeta> checkmate me
[17:51:43] <jphase> I just remember saying "one day I'm going to get paid to make shit for fun like paul irish" a few years back
[17:52:53] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: http://jsfiddle.net/tpqz87c2/ You could do something like if you wanted something along the lines of what you asked.
[17:55:49] <paul_irish> jphase: do you get paid to make shit for fun now?
[17:55:59] <jphase> I do :)
[17:56:03] <paul_irish> :D
[17:56:07] * paul_irish _o/\o_ jphase
[17:56:09] <jphase> not quite as fun as some of the stuff I've seen you make
[17:56:16] <jphase> but fun indeed
[17:56:26] <paul_irish> lemme share one cool thin
[17:56:33] * Velveeta grabs a notepad.
[17:56:38] * Velveeta opens notepad instead.
[17:56:45] * Velveeta actually opens textmate.
[17:56:47] <paul_irish> notepad.exe <3
[17:57:01] * Velveeta actually just launches a new sublime tab.
[17:57:08] <Velveeta> ok, hit us
[17:57:19] * jphase starts a quicktime video to record Velveeta's awesomeness
[17:57:45] <paul_irish> we had a gift exchange in other IRC channel and i made this for my friend miketaylr
[17:57:45] <paul_irish> http://www.paulirish.com/lovesyou/mikey/
[17:57:51] * Velveeta looks at jphase's camera and says "look what i can do!" in a voice like Stuart.
[17:57:52] <decx> everytime i use sublime i get lost doing ascii art in the codepreview
[17:57:54] <robertWorkBeer> an error page?
[17:58:11] <Velveeta> yeah but like, the most advanced 502 page evar
[17:58:27] <Velveeta> i bet it has crazy js, probably polymer or something
[17:58:33] <robertWorkBeer> aaaah wtf
[17:58:43] <robertWorkBeer> why is this amazing
[17:58:48] <Velveeta> there we go, green button
[17:58:49] <paul_irish> i know right
[17:58:57] <jphase> oooo neat!
[17:59:02] <robertWorkBeer> paul_irish your page isn't valid :(
[17:59:08] <paul_irish> try harder?
[17:59:10] <paul_irish> iunno
[17:59:14] <paul_irish> maybe its buggy
[17:59:16] <jphase> see.... this is what I'm talking about
[17:59:43] <robertWorkBeer> good stuff though i like it.
[17:59:44] <jphase> you nerd out with shit on canvas like I used to make "art" in mspaint when I was 6 years old
[17:59:49] <paul_irish> http://www.paulirish.com/lovesyou/heart/
[17:59:50] <jphase> just dork out forever on fun stuff lol
[17:59:50] <Velveeta> there's a green button in the upper right
[17:59:58] <Velveeta> the 502 is about no cached page being available
[18:00:16] <paul_irish> oh. cloudflare being stupid.
[18:00:17] <paul_irish> shrug
[18:00:23] <jphase> I like how it responds to the mouse :)
[18:00:25] <paul_irish> works on my machine!
[18:00:27] <P0RK_> BillCriswell, thanks. Here is what I have done before...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tpqz87c2/1/
[18:00:28] <robertWorkBeer> damn whuddup
[18:00:32] <robertWorkBeer> paul_irish++

[18:01:20] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[18:01:28] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: Not a big fan of vowels are you?
[18:01:45] <jphase> lol
[18:01:46] <uskerine> thanks for the help with the keydown/keypress, it works now, handling the TAB is cumbersome but easy
[18:01:56] <P0RK_> because of my name? pork was taken.
[18:01:58] <P0RK_> 8)
[18:02:04] <Velveeta> i think he means because of your variable names
[18:02:06] <BillCriswell> t
[18:02:12] <BillCriswell> Yes, the variable names.
[18:02:21] <Velveeta> except for the 'i' in inp
[18:02:25] <P0RK_> inp
[18:02:29] <BillCriswell> Also the nick. Didn't think of that till after I send the message though.
[18:02:37] <P0RK_> that's half of them
[18:02:38] <BillCriswell> sent*
[18:02:45] <Velveeta> billcriswell isn't a big fan of vowels either
[18:02:49] <Velveeta> he views them as a necessary evil
[18:03:01] <Velveeta> he wrote a whole blog post about it.. it was completely unreadable
[18:03:31] <jphase> lol
[18:03:37] <BillCriswell> Isn't there a book that's written where all the words begin with "e" or some shit?
[18:03:54] <P0RK_> eecomings?
[18:04:06] <Velveeta> no clue... but if there is, i hope it's not something dumb like "ethis eis emy estory" but rather actual legible words that all start with e
[18:04:12] <paul_irish> wanna see something cool
[18:04:15] <BillCriswell> Had it bacwards. It has no letter E in it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)
[18:04:50] <Velveeta> paul_irish: is it a dead body? because i saw that movie years ago
[18:05:20] <Velveeta> it was awesome because it was from before wesley joined starfleet academy
[18:05:23] <paul_irish> P0RK_: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/1/
[18:05:38] <paul_irish> labelElem.control // the input element
[18:05:47] <paul_irish> that its associated with via the for
[18:05:49] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: Dammit. Missed that when I was looking at the label.
[18:05:59] <BillCriswell> When I noticed the htmlFor thingie.
[18:06:01] <paul_irish> honestly i didnt knwo that existed but figured it should
[18:06:06] <paul_irish> so i went looking :)
[18:06:16] <BillCriswell> My thought process as well, but I failed.
[18:06:24] <P0RK_> .control?
[18:06:28] <paul_irish> ya
[18:06:28] <decx> so why isnt that in the jqueryized version
[18:06:40] <decx> get(0) what am i, a scientist
[18:06:43] <paul_irish> good question
[18:06:48] <P0RK_> wow. thnx
[18:06:50] <paul_irish> lol
[18:07:09] <Velveeta> what the hell is this? <input id="foo" value="Bob" < body style="border: 1px solid blue;">
[18:07:42] <paul_irish> wat
[18:07:43] <Velveeta> that's what my console outputs for inputElem
[18:07:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Oooo, good catch haha
[18:08:10] <decx> i was gonna say it's a robertmaxrees paste job
[18:08:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Hahaha
[18:08:30] <BillCriswell> Looks like a buggie.
[18:08:47] <Velveeta> is this the 'control' being referenced there? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/Attribute/control
[18:08:49] <paul_irish> missing > in the HTML
[18:09:04] <paul_irish> looks about right
[18:09:36] <paul_irish> Velveeta: yeah it was the missing > in the html  chunk
[18:09:42] <Velveeta> because if so, that's awesome... that saves me a dual dom parse in the future for having to do stupid things like var id = $(someElement).attr('id'), label = $('label[for="' + id + '"]');
[18:09:46] <P0RK_> does control go both ways?
[18:09:48] <Velveeta> gotcha
[18:09:50] <paul_irish> lets see
[18:10:21] <paul_irish> inputElem.labels[0]  // label elem
[18:10:36] <paul_irish> yo did i just find the most amazing thing or what
[18:10:41] <paul_irish> fridays are amazing
[18:10:52] <Velveeta> +1 for fridays
[18:11:17] <BillCriswell> console.dir all the elements.
[18:11:22] <paul_irish> easiest way to test this across browsers‚Ä¶
[18:11:22] <Velveeta> so now i have 2 new ways of referencing element labels that i rarely have to directly reference
[18:11:36] <Velveeta> but from now on, when i do have that need, they're not gonna know what hit em
[18:12:10] <P0RK_> i hate radio buttons. So I almost always style their labels to indicate state...this works great. THanks
[18:13:04] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: If the labels are css selectable you can do like :checked + label { color: #f00; }
[18:13:18] <Velveeta> depending on their dom order
[18:13:33] <Velveeta> god i can't wait for some of those fancypants css4 selectors i read about last year
[18:13:46] <decx> :has(convenience)
[18:14:02] <Velveeta> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/21/sneak-peek-future-selectors-level-4/
[18:14:22] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/4/
[18:14:51] <Velveeta> one of my favorite proposed upcoming features is the ability to target any arbitrary piece of a selector rule
[18:15:01] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: What's the easiest way? haha
[18:15:03] <Velveeta> and also the parent selector
[18:16:14] <Velveeta> p0rk_: and if your elements are all isolated in separate containers, you can use an adjacent sibling selector and it won't matter what their dom order is: :checked ~ label {}
[18:16:21] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I find it weird the sibling selector only selects older siblings (if that makes sense).
[18:16:38] <Velveeta> billcriswell: what do you mean?
[18:16:44] <P0RK_> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/c3u2odeh/5/
[18:17:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/8/
[18:17:38] <P0RK_> Velveeta http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/c3u2odeh/5/
[18:17:56] <BillCriswell> I had younger and older reversed even though I think I just made it up.
[18:18:02] <Velveeta> damnit bill
[18:18:09] <BillCriswell> Sorry.
[18:18:13] <Velveeta> how dare you make me learn something
[18:18:34] <Velveeta> now i just forgot what my parents gave for my 5th birthday
[18:18:59] <BillCriswell> It was probably Ninja Turtles related for me.
[18:19:26] <BillCriswell> ~ should be like, nextAll or something.
[18:20:32] <Velveeta> well, it's called the adjacent sibling selector, you would think it'd work for all adjacent siblings
[18:20:38] <P0RK_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/c3u2odeh/16/
[18:20:57] <Velveeta> er actually the plus is adjacent sibling
[18:21:12] <Velveeta> tilde is general sibling
[18:22:05] <BillCriswell>  Yes.
[18:22:17] <Velveeta> but still, yeah, you'd think it would apply to all siblings
[18:22:40] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: What's the issue?
[18:24:17] <BillCriswell> P0RK_: Thinking you want: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/19/ ?
[18:24:20] <P0RK_> I love it. It is so much easier to use $("input").get(0).labels;
[18:24:27] <BillCriswell> MOVIE TIME
[18:24:52] <P0RK_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/c3u2odeh/18/

[18:25:03] <P0RK_> Thanks for your help all...
[18:25:10] <P0RK_> wat?
[18:25:18] <decx> i dont see that prop on ff
[18:25:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Not sure. I think paul_irish started testing it cross browser and got sidetracked.
[18:25:49] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/19/ they aren't blue? =(
[18:25:57] <decx> nope
[18:25:58] <Velveeta> bill: what's on tonight's movie menu?
[18:26:25] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/c3u2odeh/1/ This work?
[18:26:45] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Letting the girlfriend pick and you know how things are when the girlfriend picks...
[18:27:04] <Velveeta> once a month, we have a movie day at work for the designers and front end devs to huddle in a room, with some particular movie theme... last month was dystopian futures, this month was football movies
[18:27:17] <Velveeta> billcriswell: so probably something like aliens vs predator, huh
[18:27:28] <BillCriswell> Friday Night Lights is my favorite of football movies.
[18:27:30] <decx> BillCriswell control works, also like .prop('control')
[18:27:35] <BillCriswell> decx: Nice.
[18:27:45] <Velveeta> we watched the replacements, rudy, and necessary roughness
[18:27:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Friday Night LIghts is great
[18:28:00] <BillCriswell> Ok. I'm out of here!
[18:28:02] <Velveeta> i do not want your life!
[18:28:04] <Velveeta> adios, sir
[18:28:54] <paul_irish> P0RK_: .control doesnt work in IE
[18:29:09] <decx> well .labels doesnt work in ff ;)
[18:29:15] <paul_irish> yah
[18:29:17] <paul_irish> and that
[18:29:20] <paul_irish> but .control works in FF
[18:29:26] <decx> yes
[18:29:45] <P0RK_> uggh I don't support IE, stupid I know, but that's the facts
[18:29:57] <paul_irish> P0RK_: GREAT
[18:29:58] <decx> i guess we'll have to keep traversing
[18:30:08] <paul_irish> works great on the mobile web
[18:30:17] <Velveeta> paul: does .labels[0] work in IE?
[18:30:32] <paul_irish> no
[18:30:36] <paul_irish> neither work in IE
[18:30:38] <Velveeta> boooooooo-urns
[18:30:49] <paul_irish> needs a polyfill
[18:30:55] <Velveeta> that's the spirit
[18:31:01] <paul_irish> Velveeta: can u write it
[18:31:33] <Velveeta> as a function, sure, not as a property reference though, so it's more of a plugin at that point
[18:31:42] <paul_irish> what
[18:31:48] <paul_irish> no i mean write a polyfill
[18:31:53] <paul_irish> like a real one
[18:32:16] <paul_irish> put that shit on the element
[18:32:18] <Velveeta> off the top of my head, i can't think of a way to polyfill a property reference without using some kind of polling function
[18:32:28] <paul_irish> getter method
[18:33:37] <Velveeta> if by getter method, you mean like an object.defineProperty call, sure, i think
[18:33:44] <paul_irish> yes
[18:33:49] <Velveeta> for 8+ right?
[18:33:53] <Velveeta> close enough
[18:34:11] <paul_irish> 8+
[18:34:37] <paul_irish> seems awesome
[18:34:43] <Velveeta> i suppose this gives me an opportunity to break in my github account finally
[18:34:51] <paul_irish> atta boy
[18:36:07] <Velveeta> i have the alcohols in me, but let's see what i can crank out in the next half hour or so
[18:41:25] <bowenac_> does on change not work for checkboxes I am trying to use this jQuery("input[type='checkbox']").on('change', function() { and just alert something for testing but this isnt working
[18:43:47] <jphase> god, everything microsoft touches turns to shit... they somehow managed to make skype a frustrating piece of garbage :(
[18:44:49] <bowenac_> jphase is on every channel lol
[18:44:54] <Velveeta> now that they bought minecraft, maybe my kid will stop liking it
[18:44:55] <jphase> hehe
[18:45:02] <jphase> bowenac_: it should fire - any js errors?
[18:45:08] <jphase> Velveeta: I am SOOOOO pissed about that btw
[18:45:22] <bowenac_> no errors no nothing
[18:45:39] <bowenac_> they are all inside a table but don't think that would matter
[18:45:58] <bowenac_> oh maybe because its inside document ready
[18:46:06] <bowenac_> and I am appending the checkboxes derrrr
[18:46:07] <jphase> doc ready is fine
[18:46:10] <jphase> ohhhh
[18:46:14] <jphase> yeah, use delegation
[18:46:26] <bowenac_> live?
[18:46:59] <jphase> no, like.... $('table.yourtable').on('change', 'input[type="checkbox"]', function() { //stuff here });
[18:47:14] <jphase> bind the event to a close parent with a child selector passed
[18:48:06] <bowenac_> that works
[18:48:09] <bowenac_> but getting an error now
[18:48:14] <bowenac_> but atleast its triggering
[18:48:21] <jphase> :)
[18:49:27] <bowenac_> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[type='checkbox
[18:49:38] <bowenac_> nm
[18:49:40] <bowenac_> forget about that
[18:49:50] <bowenac_> to much code not enough sleep lol didn't close it
[18:50:12] <bowenac_> working now
[18:50:22] <bowenac_> time to have a beer and enjoy the night
[18:52:19] <jphase> hehe

[20:06:00] <Velveeta> ok, i got that polyfill written, but IE8 is being a pita about it
[20:07:25] <P0RK_> does .wrap wrap the entire collection or each item in the collection?
[20:08:25] <Velveeta> each item in a collection
[20:08:36] <Velveeta> because technically a collection could be of disparate dom elements
[20:12:34] <P0RK_> so if I wrap my radio buttons in labels, how can I get this: <label class='radioLabel'><i class='circle_icn'>&nbsp;</i><input type='radio'...../><label>
[20:12:56] <P0RK_> if I put the <i> element in the wrap, won't it wrap the input in it as well?
[20:15:14] <Velveeta> does the <i> element exist already?
[20:15:22] <Velveeta> or is that something being inserted at the same time as the wrap?
[20:15:34] <P0RK_> inserted
[20:16:36] <Velveeta> you can do something like: $(':radio').wrap('<label class="radioLabel"></label>').before('<i class="circle_icn">&nbsp;</i>');
[20:16:46] <Velveeta> wrap and then insert your icon
[20:18:35] <P0RK_> foundation icons don't have a circle icon? really?

[23:07:05] <uskerine> hi, if   this    is a child element of a TD in a TR, how can I select the first TD of the next TR?  I tried this: nextElement=$(this).closest('tr').next('tr').next('td');   -without success-
[23:07:36] <uskerine> last next is bad I guess
[23:09:03] <albertosh> Hello all! What is the easiest way to read metadata from any website using js?
[23:11:06] <jphase> albertosh: you can select any tag in the DOM with the tag name as the selector
[23:11:18] <albertosh> but let's say i have a url
[23:11:40] <albertosh> i'm not running the script inside the dom... i need to do a get request and read the metadata
[23:11:50] <albertosh> how would you go about that?
[23:12:11] <jphase> if you're talking about external URLs, then they would need to allow CORS requests from external sources for that to work with jQuery, unless you used a CORS proxy
[23:12:21] <jphase> that type of task would be better done with node.js
[23:12:27] <jphase> imo
[23:13:20] <uskerine> albertosh, you mean launching a GET and read the answer?
[23:13:24] <uskerine> that's an AJAX request
[23:13:46] <albertosh> @uskerine yeah, i was trying like that, i am not sure how to go about it
[23:14:06] <uskerine> it depends on what your service returns
[23:14:16] <uskerine> do you have to program the back-end service too?
[23:14:28] <jphase> the site will not allow you to do that unless they allow CORS requests from *
[23:14:49] <albertosh> i can do a backend for that... it's just more work but i'm ok with that
[23:15:03] <uskerine> that's true jphase
[23:15:21] <albertosh> and i don't own the site, the site could be any site
[23:15:25] <uskerine> albertosh, if you don't do a backend how do you plan to put the metadata there?
[23:15:30] <jphase> so to do it "with js" it'd have to be done via a CORS proxy or done with node.js, otherwise a vast majority of the sites you try to pull from will fail
[23:16:23] <jphase> albertosh: if you want something quick and dirty, and not something you'd want to use for a reputable product, then http://www.corsproxy.com/ will work to do your quick dirty work
[23:17:08] <albertosh> @jphase @uskerine thanks! but if i am to do a nice product, can you point me to the right nodejs plugin for that?
[23:17:28] <jphase> albertosh: sure... I wrote most of this already if you want to look at my source ;)
[23:17:41] <albertosh> absolutely!
[23:17:45] <jphase> https://github.com/jphase/botscrape-restify
[23:18:07] <jphase> it's barebones right now, but it's basically just a REST API using restify and cheerio
[23:18:14] <albertosh> you rock man! @jphase
[23:18:15] <jphase> scrapes stuff based on a string
[23:18:30] <albertosh> no lisnece on it?
[23:18:40] * jphase is an open source developer only
[23:18:48] <jphase> yeah, not exactly what you need, but you'll just need the cheerio stuff - it may be better to just start from scratch
[23:18:57] <jphase> but you can use that for reference maybe
[23:19:06] <jphase> look into cheerio
[23:19:24] <albertosh> ok i will, thanks!
[23:19:25] <jphase> it's like a lightweight version of jQuery specifically for scraping content from sites in node.js
[23:28:16] <carel> Hi
[23:30:54] <carel> I have a small problem when I perform my jqueries, I was hoping for a small hint. My numbers keep on being changed into arrays and I was hoping someone may have a trick up their sleeve. I'm using a django backend with django-ajax as front end chatter. sending {"number":3} returns {"number":[3]} and I can't see why :S
[23:46:37] <sacho_> carel, sounds like a django question
[23:48:03] <carel> I would have thought the same but I'm sending a single number from javascript and receiving an array which seems to indicate the number is being wrapped in an array before it's sent.
[23:48:36] <carel> I also tried sending {"number" : Number(3)}
[23:49:17] <carel> I get the feeling it's being wrapped into an array by either jquery or my javascript, so that's why I asked here first over asking on django
[23:52:30] <sacho_> it's not.
[23:52:41] <carel> sacho_  is there any way to echo what jquery is sending from the client side to the client screen.
[23:54:43] <carel> Darn then I'm not sure where the wrapping is occuring. Is tehre some trick to determine where it may be happeing ?
[23:55:17] <sacho_> use your browser's developer tools
[23:57:31] <sacho_> for example, you can look in chrome's network tab to see more information about requests you make
