[00:21:46] <DarsVaeda> can I use .stopPropagation used with with .on?
[00:35:59] <sacho> yes
[00:37:04] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks
[00:47:36] <asymo> Hi, guys. I have a question. On this fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/f3854/  ,  why does it trigger both click events even though they have different classes? Thank you.
[00:56:39] <sacho_> asymo, the $(".button").click() handler would be called every time you click the button.
[00:57:10] <sacho_> asymo, http://jsfiddle.net/f3854/2/
[00:58:40] <asymo> Thank you, @sacho_. Why is that happening? the .button class gets replaced with .update, isn't it?
[01:02:50] <aways> Hy
[01:04:29] <aways> Question about Jquery mobile and Event ; I try to load an external page on the DOM ; it's make by pageContainer('load', 'toto.html'); After I need to bind some event on the new html included. I use the event : pagecontainerload
[01:04:40] <aways> But : On this event the dom isn't ready
[01:04:58] <aways> if i try to show my included html from toto.html i have nothing
[01:05:12] <aways> https://gist.github.com/BorisMorel/3d5360f448f53e43addf
[01:05:17] <aways> Have you an idea ?
[01:08:32] <greengriminal> I am trying to make use of the html2canvas library and am trying to generate a url. Now the closest I have come is the following: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7483fa238d8527047158#file-example-js-L4
[01:09:45] <greengriminal> according to HTMLCanvasElement docs it states the following for toDataURL: Returns a data: URL containing a representation of the image in the format specified by type. I mean all i want to do is generate a short and simple url so that i can access the image
[01:22:08] <Hausas> Is there a better way to do this? for (var cols = 1; cols <= 12; cols++) { $(event.target).removeClass("col-sm-" + cols); }
[01:25:58] <aways> maybe .siblings
[01:26:11] <sacho> hmm
[01:26:26] <sacho> Hausas, what browsers do you need to support?
[01:29:35] <sacho> that's a fairly terse way of removing the classes, really
[01:30:03] <Hausas> sacho: all of them
[01:31:54] <ravenzz> morning
[01:32:47] <ravenzz> so if serializeArray() returns an array of objects why its typeof is object ?
[01:32:53] <ravenzz> is it a jquery obj?
[01:34:33] <sacho> ravenzz, typeof [] === 'object'
[01:35:00] <sacho> it's a fault* of typeof
[01:35:28] <ravenzz> sacho: nvm
[01:35:33] <ravenzz> i know
[01:35:40] <ravenzz> I was {}.toString([])
[01:35:51] <ravenzz> forget to call
[01:37:51] <lacrymology> kevc: ~Q(related__field='foo') maybe?
[01:38:13] <lacrymology> sorry
[02:13:09] <olso> hi, is there something like this http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage but without the delay between sections? something like http://www.myclaude.com
[02:16:12] <madalin> olso: try the 'scrollingSpeed': 700 configuration. It's in jquery.fullPage.js :)
[02:21:48] <cannap> hi any know why this is not working when i add remove or change class names http://paste.pm/ifh.js ?
[02:21:54] <cannap> when i add new content works fine
[02:24:45] <madalin> cannap: As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document.
[02:25:30] <sacho_> cannap, attributes are not part of the DOM subtree.
[02:28:42] <madsy> I have some trouble with designing good code when using asynch ajax requests with jQuery. When I need to wait for several ajax requests, I use jQuery.when() on the ajax promises. But when that callback creates new ajax requests, the latter call to jQuery.when() finishes before the new ajax callbacks. How do I resolve that problem?
[02:30:14] <madsy> That is, I have ajax requests that depend on earlier ajax requests. Yet, I need the main function to not return until everything is done.
[02:30:51] <madsy> I could make a global callback which the inner function could call when it's done. But that seems very hacky.
[02:31:34] <cannap> hmm
[02:31:52] <cannap> and how i can check every changes in a div
[02:40:58] <METEMEDO> madsy: can you give us an example?
[02:42:54] <cannap> added my own trigger
[02:50:50] <METEMEDO> cannap: that's the most correct way i think´
[02:51:13] <METEMEDO> make sure when you change the div, you trigger the event
[02:51:31] <METEMEDO> that's how i did it on my current project
[02:52:46] <madsy> METEMEDO: Well, I'm using YQL to scrape some info on movies and actors from IMDB. First I get info on actors, and I wait for those ajax promises with jQuery.when().done(). Then based on that combined data, I make some new ajax requests inside that callback, leading to a new jQuery.when().done() callback. Finally inside there all of my data is ready. But at that point, the main function has long since exited.
[02:53:51] <madsy> So I guess I need to pass on a callback which uses my data to update the DOM from within those long nested functions?
[02:54:47] <METEMEDO> do you need it to be async?
[02:55:07] <METEMEDO> because if you need to wait for a response, you should be using sync
[02:58:18] <madsy> METEMEDO: Well, there is a lot of ajax requests, so if I made them all synchronous, I bet it would become extremely slow.
[03:00:25] <METEMEDO> well, if you need to wait for a lot of data, i don't think there is a lot you can do, unless maybe load the data in chunks like the first 3 movies with the respective actors, when finished, load 3 more
[03:01:15] <METEMEDO> if you notice that 3 is fast, try increasing to 4-5. if it's slow, reduce to 1-2 at a time
[03:01:53] <METEMEDO> but first of all you should think about the expected behavior
[03:02:48] <madsy> I'm not really complaining about the performance. I wonder how to best design an application that suffers from callback hell. My data is ready deep inside several callbacks. I'm more used to synchronous code where I can actually return the result from a function.
[03:03:22] <madsy> So should I pass in a callback and call it from where my data is ready?
[03:03:33] <METEMEDO> is the user able to leave the app/window while movies are still loading? then make it async and in chunks. does the user need all the data to do anything in your app? then you should do it sync
[03:03:41] <METEMEDO> it's all about the expected behavior
[03:04:30] <madsy> You seem to misunderstand my question. I'm not asking about synch vs asynch or about user experience. I'm asking about code design.
[03:15:22] <gnuyen> if i pass a reference to $() does that work like it does when you do $(document) and $(window)?
[03:15:46] <gnuyen> like if i had a reference to a dom object gotten by getElementById can i stick that into $()
[03:16:38] <gnuyen> like x = document.getElementById(“horse”); $(x).css(“border”, “1”); is the same as $(“#horse”).css(“border”,”1”);
[03:20:01] <METEMEDO> gnuyen: copy that code, paste on a jsfiddle and run it
[03:20:30] <madalin> lol.
[03:20:52] <madalin> he's using the wrong quotes.
[03:20:56] <madalin> It should be " :)
[03:21:04] <METEMEDO> ' ... '
[03:21:11] <METEMEDO> better
[03:21:16] <METEMEDO> :D
[03:21:18] <madalin> " works too :P
[03:21:46] <gnuyen> am I?
[03:21:48] <METEMEDO> it's amazing the number of times i've copied code from a blog and pasted it
[03:22:03] <METEMEDO> and couldn't understand why it said unexpected character "
[03:22:13] <METEMEDO> then like 2 hours later i realized
[03:22:20] <METEMEDO> its a weird quote character! omfg
[03:22:28] <METEMEDO> and it happened several times
[03:23:36] <gnuyen> well just because it works
[03:23:39] <gnuyen> doesn’t mean it will always work
[03:23:45] <gnuyen> I couldn’t find it in the documentation
[03:24:25] <madalin> gnuyen: what couldnt you find ?
[03:24:53] <gnuyen> whether or not I could stick a reference inside of the jquery function
[03:24:59] <gnuyen> i mean there are examples with document and window
[03:25:02] <gnuyen> and selector strings
[03:25:11] <gnuyen> i probably just missed it
[03:50:03] <bePolite> Is there a better way to generate HTMl content using jquery? I have this Block already http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/uL723/
[04:03:08] <shwaiil> hi
[04:03:28] <shwaiil> Q: can I have defered or promise  on insertAfter ? or something like that ? Thank you!
[04:03:56] <sacho> your question doesn't make sense
[04:07:03] <shwaiil> sacho: thanks for looking! the reason why I ask this it's because I want an css animation to start just after the element is inserted. I start with opacity: 0 otherwise I see the element scaling etc. At the moment it's fine with animation-delay but I wonder if I could use defered or a promise for something like this, or something similar.
[04:07:42] <shwaiil> maybe just use setTimeout() after the insert ?!
[04:08:00] <shwaiil> setTimeout(function(){ ...add animated class here... }, 0)
[04:10:46] <sacho> well, the timeout would work.
[04:14:08] <jop008> Is there a way to create an app using a datagrid looking nice on mobile but also nice on widescreens desktops (more excel look and feel)
[05:00:29] <aways> Waht is the best lib to validate my form client side ?
[05:00:49] <aways> http://jqueryvalidation.org/ ??
[05:07:49] <K4T> I am using display table-cell etc in my project. Is it possible to set width of table-cell elements ot be equal of content? Now width is selected automatically ;/
[05:08:09] <K4T> I know it is a CSS question, but some ppl may have now answer to that question
[05:16:17] <phoenixsun> its probably a silly question but in jQuery do 'while() loops' stops the program flow until they have ended?
[05:32:31] <OmicroN_> aways, there's never really a 'best' for anything or else there wouldn't be 100 varieties of the same things out there in the world :) its all about your own preferences
[05:33:59] <aways> OmicroN_, I choose html5
[05:34:01] <aways> :)
[05:34:19] <aways> But android not respect this features ...
[05:35:40] <OmicroN_> all about what works best with your coding style or how you want to function, how frequently updated it is, the overall size of it, does it contain a lot more stuff then you actually need it for thus having more bloat then you want
[05:37:03] <OmicroN_> i personally use https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine for my client side form validation
[05:46:20] <khurram> hi all , can some one please help me understand why the console.log gets printed twice http://pastie.org/9450365
[05:51:39] <phoenixsun> Hi, what is the best way to implement a video seeker bar in terms of getting updates on the videos current position. Is it my using timeupdate() ?
[05:52:14] <khurram> hi all , can some one please help me understand why the console.log gets printed twice http://pastie.org/9450365
[05:53:21] <OmicroN_> that looks like some nodejs code khurram
[05:53:50] <khurram> OmicroN_: yes its nodejs code but why the console.log gets printed twice upon a single request ??
[05:54:30] <OmicroN_> not sure, haven't used the http module of nodejs before, but probably better to ask your question there if you haven't already
[05:57:18] <marko_> hi
[05:58:01] <cannap> How can i exclude items in sorable by data-attribute? http://laravel.io/bin/9VJ8z
[05:58:06] <cannap> sortable
[06:08:54] <minato>  i am using phonegap inapp browser to open a link window.open(encodeURI('http://link here/directorylisting'), '_blank', 'location=no'); when a user clicks on txt file url it opens, but when a user clicks on zip file url it doesnt do anything, i want it to be able to download the zip file
[06:09:36] <minato> i have turned the ajax off for all the links
[06:19:00] <jop008> Anyone advice on a nice datagrid row selecting ordering sort pagination looking nice on desktop and mobile devices?
[06:19:56] <mooncup> datatables!
[06:20:05] <BillCriswell> jop008: What strategy do you plan on using on mobile with wide tables?
[06:20:05] <mooncup> well I don't know about mobile
[06:20:09] <mooncup> but it's great on desktop
[06:20:57] <BillCriswell> mooncup: It seems responsive, but it looks like it just cuts columns out.
[06:21:22] <BillCriswell> mooncup: Agreed. It seems like an awesome plugin.
[06:21:22] <mooncup> ah right
[06:21:25] <mooncup> that's a shame :(
[06:21:38] <BillCriswell> tables on mobile just suck flat out haha
[06:21:40] <mooncup> I'm using it at the moment for a few bits and it's fantastic
[06:22:02] <mooncup> the rest of my site is responsive, but I didn't bother with the tables
[06:22:12] <mooncup> who looks at large amounts of tabular data on a phone?
[06:22:50] <BillCriswell> mooncup: I'm sure someone does, who I have no idea haha.
[06:23:16] <BillCriswell> http://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php this approach is nice, but I still think I like the idea of just letting it scroll horizontally in like an overflow div parent.
[06:23:46] <BillCriswell> As soon as a table becomes a list like the responsive demo the whole point of a table seems to away.
[06:24:25] <BillCriswell> Responsive table *looks* better definitely, but I don't think it works nearly as well.
[06:41:15] <decx> is that with content: "" & hardcoded css?
[06:41:31] <decx> ye
[06:41:42] <decx> pain in the ass
[06:41:48] <decx> i did it for a checkout once
[06:41:55] <Yaazkal> Hi I'm trying to use this jquery plugin: http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?what.html it works good. But after executing it, the map areas are "displaced" so images are not overlaping correctly. Site is http://dev.marcell.co anyone that can help me troubleshoot this?
[06:47:01] <BillCriswell> decx: When I used that approach I wrote JS to write that CSS for me.
[06:48:17] <BillCriswell> decx: Basically looped through the <th>'s and wrote some :nth-child() css.
[06:50:39] <decx> that shit aint economical for one table with static heads
[06:51:07] <BillCriswell> decx: What do you mean?
[06:51:38] <decx> writing css 5 mins writing js to write css 10mins
[06:52:24] <decx> i also feel dirty when i inject a style tag
[06:52:27] <BillCriswell> decx: When you have a lot of tables with a lot of different headers thought...
[06:52:34] <BillCriswell> though*
[06:52:41] <decx> well then it becomes economical
[06:53:04] <decx> cost benefit and all that jaazz
[06:53:06] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm getting more comfortable with injecting style tags
[06:53:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes. All those economics stuffs.
[06:53:43] <decx> i still dont like it
[06:53:53] <decx> phones should do that by themselves
[06:54:06] <decx> making tables better and such
[06:54:16] <decx> they did it with selects
[06:54:21] <decx> why not tables
[06:54:34] <BillCriswell> I have no idea.
[06:54:42] <BillCriswell> decx: http://pastie.org/pastes/9450494/text was the function, if you're curious haha
[06:55:20] <BillCriswell> It would fail pretty good when a colspan is introduced, but it's ok.
[06:56:59] <BillCriswell> On this project I actually just ended up doing $('table').wrap('<div class="scroller"></div>') and made it overflow horizontally.
[06:57:25] <decx> i dont see $head declared anywhere
[06:57:45] <BillCriswell> It's in the outer thingie.
[06:58:06] <BillCriswell> Since I use it a lot.
[06:58:13] <decx> ye i did the wrapping thing also for some project
[06:58:29] <decx> that way it's still a table
[06:59:13] <BillCriswell> decx: Exactly.
[06:59:37] <BillCriswell> Really glad we went that way, because the tabls were sortable and everything and it was just bad.
[07:00:24] <decx> yeah you make it responsive so that it fits into a small viewport and then you repeat the headers 15 times , it's ridiculous
[07:00:45] <decx> it worked for a basket overview table, but any real table becomes terrible
[07:01:07] <BillCriswell> decx: Definitely.
[07:02:21] <decx> but when i first had the idea of using content: "" for that i felt like a masterbrain
[07:02:25] <decx> ^^
[07:02:48] <decx> "must exterminate horizontal scrollbars on mobile"
[07:03:13] <decx> *error error, table is not a table.... tds with display: block, error error*
[07:04:58] <BillCriswell> decx: I feel WAY more weird altering the display of a table than I do adding CSS through JS.
[07:14:03] <cannap> When i use this http://laravel.io/bin/W9KlL i cant move the .row-helper but all items in the row-helper i want to only allow the drop thing on the data-handler="sortable" any?
[07:14:19] <cannap> sortable thing
[07:16:15] <bePolite> If I load 2 different versions of the jquery library, which of them takes precidence?
[07:18:22] <BillCriswell> bePolite: The second one.
[07:18:34] <BillCriswell> If you're just loading them and not running noConflict or anything.
[07:28:45] <bePolite> Please why am I not getting output here?
[07:29:16] <BillCriswell> bePolite: I said "The second one if you're just loading them and not running noConflict or anything".
[07:30:13] <bePolite> Sorry
[07:31:17] <bePolite> Please why am I not getting output here?
[07:31:18] <bePolite> http://jsbin.com/hiruviwo/1/edit
[07:32:50] <BillCriswell> bePolite: You are.
[07:33:09] <bePolite> I mean I am not getting the divs I want to create
[07:34:31] <bePolite> are we all viewing the same thing?
[07:35:31] <BillCriswell> bePolite: It did just work for me.
[07:36:03] <bePolite> please can I see what you have?
[07:36:45] <BillCriswell> It's not working now for whatever reason.
[07:37:51] <bePolite> Okey I think its the part where I am creating the div nodes
[07:38:21] <BillCriswell> bePolite: http://jsbin.com/kasigoju/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:38:32] <BillCriswell> This works... did you switch somethign while I was looking at it? lol
[07:39:50] <bePolite> BillCriswell: Yes I changed line 6 of the javascript code
[07:40:15] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:40:40] <bePolite> Okey do you have an Idea why it is not working now/
[07:41:06] <BillCriswell> The link I sent you was working.
[07:42:00] <bePolite> yes it is working
[07:42:47] <BillCriswell> Sweeeet
[07:44:59] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle seems dead.
[08:00:11] <xxx1337> how do I use the console to check if jquery functions are firing correctly?
[08:01:05] <METEMEDO> on the functions, add this line: console.log('Function XPTO fired!');
[08:01:34] <bePolite> I am trying to create many "<td>" elements with jquery. I have this http://jsbin.com/kasigoju/3/edit
[08:01:39] <bePolite> Is there a cleaner approach/
[08:02:06] <METEMEDO> you can also console.log('Function X: var1=' + var1 + ', var2=' + var2);
[08:03:43] <METEMEDO> i dont think there is a magical way of doing that for you
[08:04:56] <Prometheian> If I need to polyfill a JS method, do I place the polyfill above my method, or in my method?
[08:09:01] <xxx1337> Can I add in console.log('Function XPTO fired!'); into the site via developer tools?
[08:09:05] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: you are here?
[08:09:08] <sc_> any regex experts here?
[08:09:11] <Amnesthesia> ya
[08:09:14] <sc_> I need to make 8/12/1918 into 8/1918
[08:09:24] <AlexRussia> xxx1337: what you mean via? @_@
[08:09:34] <Amnesthesia> sc_: try rubular.com
[08:09:37] <Hausas> How do I amend this selector $(div).find('.legendString').val() so it would ignore inputs that are disabled?
[08:09:43] <AlexRussia> xxx1337: i mean, console.log is just way for append something to log
[08:09:59] <BillCriswell> sc_: Don't need a regex, just split it and grab what you need.
[08:10:01] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: Bourbone work with Rails 4?@_@
[08:10:26] <sc_> wouldn't regex be faster, not that i have a lot to replace on the fly...
[08:10:37] <BillCriswell> var date = '8/12/1918'.split('/'), formattedDate = [data[0], date[2]].join('/');
[08:10:38] <AlexRussia> xxx1337: this function work in your browser and only there
[08:10:49] <Amnesthesia> sc_: you use it to test out regex :)
[08:11:03] <BillCriswell> sc_: Regex would be overkill here.
[08:11:11] <sc_> BillCriswell: thanks
[08:11:20] <Amnesthesia> AlexRussia: yes it does :)
[08:11:22] <sc_> exactly what i needed
[08:11:58] <Hausas> Is it $(div).find('.legendString').not(':disabled').val() ?
[08:12:12] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: just on site written '3.1+' and for me it seems 'in branch 3 3.1 or higher, only'
[08:12:23] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: :D
[08:12:25] <Hausas> or $(div).find('.legendString:enabled').val() ?
[08:12:31] <Amnesthesia> AlexRussia: I'm using it with Rails 4.0.7 atm
[08:12:41] <BillCriswell> Hausas: That would work. do you need to serialize all this data though?
[08:13:01] <decx> missing quotes
[08:13:08] <BillCriswell> Hausas: Is there mroe than one legendString?
[08:13:17] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: tell me....how i could append thing one the site using jquery, like div for example? I just still see only how to change exist...
[08:13:17] <Hausas> 3 of them
[08:13:17] <Hausas> mostly
[08:13:30] <BillCriswell> How do you need the data?
[08:13:41] <Amnesthesia> AlexRussia: $("#element").append("<div></div>") ?
[08:13:53] <Hausas> I don't tbh
[08:14:02] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: ou,  i mean, into body
[08:14:05] <BillCriswell> Hausas: So why do you need the value?
[08:14:12] <Amnesthesia> $("body").append("<div></div>")
[08:14:22] <Hausas> Just to show these options exist
[08:14:23] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: after dot all seems fine :D
[08:14:28] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: ok
[08:14:50] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: 'body','head','title' is are keyword? @_@
[08:14:54] <AlexRussia> like*
[08:15:02] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: for html tags i mean
[08:15:35] <AlexRussia> keywords*
[08:15:42] <Amnesthesia> they're html tags and all html tags with or without ID / classes can be accessed with jquery too
[08:15:47] <AlexRussia> my f*cking english :D
[08:15:55] <BillCriswell> Hausas: Not sure I'm following you to help out auy further, but the .legendString:enabled would work.
[08:16:04] <Amnesthesia> $("div").whatever(), $("header").whatever(), $("div#with-id").whatever() etc
[08:16:11] <Amnesthesia> works fine with any html tag
[08:16:16] <Amnesthesia> even body
[08:16:30] <BillCriswell> Hausas: Typically you should ne able to just serialize it and get the form data in a way the browser would.
[08:16:38] <AlexRussia> lol
[08:16:40] <AlexRussia> hm
[08:16:54] <AlexRussia> i guess, html is one language where head could live without body :D
[08:16:55] <damarusama> I want to append a variable to a dom selector
[08:17:18] <damarusama> can I do $('.selector'+variable).doSomething
[08:17:29] <damarusama> that doesn't seems to work
[08:17:42] <BillCriswell> Hausas: http://jsbin.com/foqomehi/1/edit?html,js,output like this.
[08:17:57] <BillCriswell> damarusama: That would work just fine.
[08:18:30] <Hausas> Thanks
[08:18:36] <damarusama> BillCriswell: thanks
[08:18:56] <decx> BillCriswell is killing it totay
[08:19:06] <BillCriswell> decx: I have energy today.
[08:19:20] <BillCriswell> I think my two months at the gym have finally yielded very little results haha
[08:19:37] <Hausas> I didn't even know console.table existed :o
[08:19:39] <decx> dont tell that to monday billcriswell he will punch you in the mouth
[08:19:46] <Hausas> You made my life so much  easier
[08:19:46] <BillCriswell> I was cranky.
[08:19:57] <BillCriswell> Hausas: YEah, console.table is the bee's knees.
[08:20:05] <BillCriswell> How the hell did that expression get popular.
[08:20:13] <decx> it's like a 30s thing
[08:20:15] <decx> i read about it
[08:20:22] <decx> but forgot all relevant details
[08:20:40] <decx> like the cat's meow
[08:20:54] <BillCriswell> That's another weird one.
[08:21:37] <decx> [...] it was just a nonsense expression that denoted something that didn't have any meaningful existence - the kind of thing that a naive apprentice would be sent to the stores to ask for, like a 'sky-hook' or 'striped paint'.
[08:22:07] <BillCriswell> decx: Kind of sounds like the opposite of what I'd think.
[08:22:56] <decx> well later in the text it probably goes into detail as to how the meaning changed to 'something really good' but i'm too lazy to read all that
[08:23:26] <decx> The nonsense expression 'the bee's knees' was taken up by the socialites of Roaring 20s America and added to the list of 'excellent' phrases.
[08:23:29] <BillCriswell> Yeah same.
[08:23:36] <robertmaxrees> most excellent.
[08:23:46] <decx> see it's just dumb kids using an expression they don't understand and reappropriating it
[08:23:55] <BillCriswell> most excellent originated with Bill & Ted I thought.
[08:24:00] <decx> the yolo of the 20s
[08:24:34] <decx> bill and ted taught me everything about life i need to know
[08:24:38] <decx> be excellent to each other
[08:24:55] <damarusama> I want to make price calculation in a form, but I also want to keep the value="" of the input not being the price (so that I can send that by email)
[08:24:56] <BillCriswell> That's really all these is to it.
[08:25:00] <BillCriswell> all there*
[08:25:30] <damarusama> could I add an extra element to my input something like price="100" in the html so that jquery can pick it up for calculation
[08:26:14] <BillCriswell> damarusama: You can, if it doesn't need to actually be in the form you can just keep it in JS.
[08:26:48] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: something wrong...
[08:27:12] <damarusama> BillCriswell: I'll just need to have the total in the form at the end of the calculation to send by email
[08:27:15] <damarusama> thanks
[08:27:27] <decx> learned a new word today
[08:27:30] <decx> to elide
[08:27:49] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: this aren't work... https://gist.github.com/a71d691c7c8e27abde4a
[08:30:20] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia # is for IDs, . is for classes.
[08:30:27] <robertmaxrees> basic CSS>
[08:30:32] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: @_@
[08:30:47] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: you be happy if i said with '.' same thing? @_@
[08:31:01] <AlexRussia> ...
[08:31:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[08:31:37] <AlexRussia> ...
[08:31:42] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: body is class?
[08:32:05] <robertmaxrees> first you're doing this: $("body").append("<div id=\"first\"></div>"); then you're trying to do $(".first").append("Hello, World!"); - .first is targeting class="first".  you want #first
[08:32:17] <decx> #id, .class, tag, [attribute]
[08:32:56] <decx> is it just me or is fiddle dying again
[08:32:59] <decx> was ok for like a day
[08:33:01] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[08:33:19] <BillCriswell> Too many megabytes probably.
[08:33:27] <decx> well duh, download more ram
[08:33:30] <AlexRussia> https://gist.github.com/83f2beea1284bdb32201
[08:34:00] <AlexRussia> decx: which? my script? @_@
[08:34:08] <robertmaxrees> he's being funny.
[08:34:11] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to get my friend Jim to dress like Artie ( The Strongest Man In The World ) for his next strong man competition.
[08:34:34] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/83f2beea1284bdb32201 anyway nothing :(
[08:34:44] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell did you know that guy does the voice of khan on King of the Hill?
[08:34:50] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia http://jsbin.com/tagoruki/1/edit
[08:34:52] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[08:35:04] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I did know that oddly enough.
[08:35:20] <BillCriswell> I watched way too much King Of The Hill. Wish Netflix would get it back.
[08:35:46] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia even better: http://jsbin.com/tagoruki/1/edit
[08:36:37] <morfin> huys
[08:36:53] <morfin> *guys does not appending child elements change page size?
[08:36:55] <morfin> hmm
[08:37:11] <morfin> i am appending to the table and my scrollbar does not appear somehow
[08:37:21] <robertmaxrees> morfin depends on your page css.
[08:37:26] <morfin> scripted scrollbar
[08:37:36] <robertmaxrees> by defa- "scripted scrollbar"?
[08:37:47] <morfin> ?
[08:37:56] <robertmaxrees> what is a scripted scrollbar?
[08:38:10] <morfin> jquery scrollbar
[08:38:18] <morfin> called tinyscrollbar
[08:38:21] <jirka> hello all, anyone using pjax here please?
[08:38:28] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ jirka
[08:38:49] <robertmaxrees> awww the bot's having problems - jirka just ask your quest.
[08:38:54] <robertmaxrees> *question - if we can help, we will.
[08:39:37] <morfin> i want to use design where i have top panel and under top panel scrollable area
[08:39:38] <jirka> ok, great, thank you. I wanted to ask how would i update block(s) outside the container on pjax form submit.
[08:39:54] <robertmaxrees> pjax doesn't handle form submits, does it?
[08:40:00] <robertmaxrees> pjax just does pages.
[08:40:20] <robertmaxrees> morfin why not just do a fixed-position element at the top?
[08:40:37] <morfin> it will close top inputs in form
[08:40:53] <morfin> idk how to do that properly fix fixed blocks
[08:41:12] <robertmaxrees> morfin can you setup a jsfiddle or jsbin with what you're trying to do?
[08:41:31] <sc_> damn, now i have to sort a 2d array of month/year
[08:41:32] <jirka> robertmaxrees: well, there's experimental function described here: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax#pjaxsubmit ((un-)fortunately) we're using it ...)
[08:42:29] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ... http://jsbin.com/tagoruki/1/ ...magic...
[08:42:45] <morfin> maybe just somehow trigger zoom out?
[08:42:47] <robertmaxrees> jirka interesting.  I don't know how you update content outside since i'm personally not very familiar with pjax.  you'll probably have to do some kind of manual hook and run that manually.
[08:43:27] <jirka> robertmaxrees: ok thank you, i wondered if there's some simple way ....
[08:44:05] <morfin> btw that looks like Chrome bug
[08:44:12] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that there is.  if their documentation doesn't say as much, you might not be able to.
[08:44:53] <morfin> and JSFiddle does not work for me
[08:45:08] <robertmaxrees> morfin yeah looks to be down for all of us.  try jsbin
[08:48:25] <Prometheian> In $().each(i, v), is v the same as $().each() $(this)?
[08:48:25] <morfin> i can't fiddle that
[08:48:39] <robertmaxrees> morfin can't fiddle what?
[08:48:40] <morfin> i'll need to copy 3/4 of app
[08:49:00] <morfin> hmm
[08:49:06] <dmsuperman> Prometheian: yes
[08:49:12] <dmsuperman> oh no... v = this
[08:49:14] <dmsuperman> not $(this)
[08:49:28] <morfin> jsbin does not run my JS but prints it
[08:49:29] <Prometheian> Wat
[08:49:29] <morfin> as is
[08:49:44] <robertmaxrees> morfin wat share the link
[08:50:16] <dmsuperman> Prometheian: v is the same as this
[08:50:21] <dmsuperman> Prometheian: v is not the same as $(this)
[08:50:40] <Prometheian> What's the difference between $(this) and this?
[08:50:40] <dmsuperman> You will need to do $(v) if you want a jquery object. this is the actual node itself
[08:50:43] <Prometheian> ah
[08:51:27] <Prometheian> kk, threw a bunch of $() around things and code works, tyvm!
[08:53:39] <morfin> aaaw what a buggy piece of...
[08:56:51] <morfin> http://imgur.com/S0Wig9D
[08:57:10] <morfin> i gues
[08:57:21] <morfin> i guess i just divided by zero
[08:58:02] <AlexRussia> morfin: where cocaine? @_@
[08:58:03] <jParkton> I have a mysql db what is the best way to get that info from the db?
[08:58:22] <systemfault> jParkton: Weird question…. using SQL?
[08:58:33] <jParkton> call some php file from $.getJSON('some.php')
[08:58:42] <systemfault> ahhh, using PHP
[08:58:42] <AlexRussia> @_@
[08:58:52] <AlexRussia> yep, i too think about it systemfault  :D
[08:59:09] <jParkton> systemfault: I dont know
[08:59:30] <robertmaxrees> morfin hy haven't you just shared the link?
[08:59:35] <jParkton> I have the db so what is the best way to get that info? does jquery support direct calls to mysql?
[08:59:41] <AlexRussia> jParkton: you php generate json? @_@
[08:59:47] <jParkton> ok
[08:59:53] <robertmaxrees> jParkton you need a server-side language.
[08:59:59] <jParkton> ah
[08:59:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't directly call your DB
[09:00:00] <morfin> btw
[09:00:05] <jParkton> I can node
[09:00:07] <AlexRussia> jParkton: call db without js unsafe
[09:00:07] <jParkton> I guess
[09:00:12] <systemfault> jParkton: Just use PDO to fetch the elements… then you create a PHP object/array and format the data the way you like… then finally, all you have to do is to echo json_encode($theArrayOrTheObject);
[09:00:25] <AlexRussia> jParkton: ou, i mean, inside of*
[09:00:25] <sc_> anyway to easily sort an array by key, instead of key value?
[09:00:26] <jParkton> ok
[09:00:51] <robertmaxrees> sc_ arrays don't have keys.
[09:00:57] <robertmaxrees> sc_ arrays have numbered indexes.
[09:00:57] <sc_> object
[09:01:02] <robertmaxrees> objects aren't sortable.
[09:01:33] <robertmaxrees> if order is important, use an array.
[09:03:45] <sc_> so i have whatever this is: http://pastebin.com/BS3icDuA
[09:03:50] <sc_> it is an array
[09:04:09] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:04:19] <robertmaxrees>  [false/: 4701, 9/1918: 20, 7/1918: 8, 11/1918: 15, 10/1918: 34…] is not a valid JS array
[09:04:27] <PantsOfChoco> best way to add a scrollbar to a dialog
[09:04:29] <PantsOfChoco> ?
[09:04:36] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco overflow: scroll;
[09:04:57] <PantsOfChoco> is that in the definition of the dialog? where like autoopen and show are?
[09:05:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:05:07] <morfin> too bad client JS can't do sockets
[09:05:13] <morfin> only WebSockets
[09:05:20] <sc_> robertmaxrees: it seems to be working to count the number of occurrences of something
[09:05:32] <robertmaxrees> sc_ can you create a jsbin to show us what you're doing?
[09:05:39] <sc_> not really
[09:05:45] <sc_> lol
[09:05:49] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:06:02] <sc_> i am not doing a good job in helping you help me
[09:06:04] <Hausas> Is there a way to find out what button was pressed after the keypress event if we are not passing an event into the handler function?
[09:06:28] <robertmaxrees> jsbin.com/mapebeca/1/edit <- not a valid JS array, sooo...
[09:06:39] <robertmaxrees> Hausas $(this) is the clicked button.
[09:06:52] <morfin> i broke jsbin :D
[09:06:54] <Hausas> I mean
[09:07:05] <Hausas> I had keyboard in mind
[09:07:06] <robertmaxrees> err, sorry Hausas you mean like a keyboard button press yeah?
[09:07:14] <Hausas> yeah
[09:07:17] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsbin.com/yajimewo/2/edit  like that robert?
[09:07:33] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco in your CSS, not JS
[09:07:42] <PantsOfChoco> ah gotcha
[09:07:51] <Prometheian> Can I not do what I'm doing in this method? http://www.hastebin.com/ujuheyizeg.coffee
[09:07:57] <Hausas> And it goes like this: $( "#target" ).keypress(function() {   console.log( "How to get button?" ); });
[09:08:00] <robertmaxrees> Hausas you need to pass the event.
[09:08:20] <Hausas> So you're saying, that there's no way?
[09:08:25] <sc_> here is my nightmare: http://pastebin.com/BEpWbCuH
[09:08:26] <robertmaxrees> Hausas not that i'm aware of.
[09:08:26] <Hausas> apart from passing an event
[09:08:29] <sc_> or the part i need help with
[09:08:37] <Hausas> Oh, ic
[09:08:38] <Hausas> thanks
[09:09:37] <sc_> i need to essentially sort myDate by the key I am using
[09:09:52] <robertmaxrees> sc_ it's hard to help without the data and a working example.
[09:09:57] <Amnesthesia> AlexRussia: Try placing it in a $(document).ready(function(){ // Code here }); or place the script after your body tag to make sure it's run after the body has loaded. Cant modify elements that arent there yet
[09:10:18] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: let me...
[09:12:42] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: like it? https://gist.github.com/9ddb4f60ca277b5deb47
[09:13:09] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia i showed you how to do this earlier.
[09:13:28] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: yes, and this work...only on your site
[09:13:39] <damarusama> for a dropdown select menu I created a property called price, now to gather the price together:
[09:13:43] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia wrap your JS in a document ready.
[09:13:52] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/9ddb4f60ca277b5deb47
[09:13:52] <damarusama> var selectedValues = $('#multipleSelect').val();
[09:14:08] <damarusama> can I use the .val() function?
[09:14:09] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia you need to put that last )}; on a new line.
[09:14:18] <b-lew> is jsfiddle down for anyone else?
[09:14:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:14:30] <damarusama> yep
[09:14:38] <Hausas> How do I select input[name='username'] and input[name='password'] in one jquery selector? input[name='username','password'] ?
[09:14:55] <b-lew> humm okay I guess I'll use pastie.
[09:14:57] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: you mean });?
[09:15:03] <bePolite> Please how can I get the outer HTML of a jquery object?
[09:15:09] <robertmaxrees> Alexer yes, sorry
[09:15:16] <robertmaxrees> err, AlexRussia
[09:15:19] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: k
[09:15:30] <robertmaxrees> Hausas $("input[name='username'],input[name='password']")
[09:15:31] <b-lew> is there a reason why I would be getting a syntax error with this? http://pastie.org/9450842
[09:15:34] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ...nothing
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia setup a jsfiddle please.
[09:15:44] <b-lew> on line 3
[09:15:53] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: jsfiddle? @_@
[09:15:55] <Hausas> thanks, robertmaxrees
[09:16:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry, jsbin
[09:16:44] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: you mean http://jsbin.com /
[09:16:47] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ?*
[09:16:54] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia yes...
[09:17:05] <robertmaxrees> b-lew use .prop instead of .attr(), and you're missing an opening ( after the if
[09:17:17] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: but em...even if it work on jsbin....this should work on my browser, but it does not :(
[09:17:43] <b-lew> thanks robertmaxrees I would if I could... site is still on 1.6.0 :-/ they won't let me update either.
[09:17:51] <b-lew> I'll try the ( though.
[09:18:28] <aniasis> Does anyone know what the difference between Modernizr and Webshims?
[09:18:40] <robertmaxrees> modernizr does feature detection.
[09:18:49] <robertmaxrees> webshims shims in behaviors/features I'll guess.
[09:19:11] <robertmaxrees> b-lew .prop() was added in 1.6
[09:20:00] <b-lew> oh great! I'll make the switch then and test! thanks a lot!
[09:20:34] <robertmaxrees> b-lew but like i said, you're missing that opening paren after the if
[09:21:15] <b-lew> Yea robertmaxrees I see it now. Thanks for the 2nd set of eyes!
[09:21:30] <Goop> hey, is there anything in jQuery that can convert a get string (?this=that&that=this) into an object?
[09:21:32] <Prometheian> Am I building this string correctly? http://jsbin.com/kuqutodu/1/edit?js
[09:21:35] <b-lew> rebooting resin to test...
[09:22:11] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian can you setup some dummy html in there to play around with?
[09:22:21] <Prometheian> yeah gimme a min
[09:22:42] <Goop> eg./ param turns objects, arrays into a get string
[09:22:46] <Goop> I need the opposite
[09:22:54] <robertmaxrees> Goop not that i'm aware of.
[09:23:03] <systemfault> Goop: No, nothing bundled… you can find a deparam function somewhere
[09:23:08] <damarusama> in <input price="100">Tomatoes</input> how can I retreive price with jquery - the val() function only retrieve the Tomatos
[09:23:19] <Goop> I'll just build one, I thought there was one built in. poop
[09:23:20] <Goop> thanks
[09:23:22] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: it always goes to the else no matter how many inputs I've selected. does .length > 1 work in 1.6?
[09:23:32] <systemfault> damarusama: .attr('price')
[09:23:45] <damarusama> thanks
[09:24:02] <robertmaxrees> use .prop(), not .attr()
[09:24:19] <robertmaxrees> b-lew you want to check the value, not the length
[09:24:22] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Totally unrelated in that case.
[09:24:53] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: I'm try to say if more than 1 checkbox is checked
[09:25:00] <b-lew> I'm using prop now
[09:25:04] <b-lew> works great!
[09:25:18] <b-lew> just need to check the value
[09:25:24] <b-lew> i'll google that
[09:25:27] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Oopsie, thought you were talking about damarusama's problem :)
[09:25:52] <robertmaxrees> systemfault you should use .prop() instead of .attr() always
[09:25:55] <robertmaxrees> well, almost always
[09:26:13] <Prometheian> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/kuqutodu/1/edit?html,output ?
[09:26:48] <robertmaxrees> b-lew you want  if $('input[name="didcid"]:checked').length > 1) {
[09:27:23] <robertmaxrees> err, with the parens in place, you want  if ($('input[name="didcid"]:checked').length > 1) {
[09:28:16] <b-lew> Thanks robertmaxrees I'll give that a shot. wasn't for sure if :checked worked in 1.6
[09:28:31] <robertmaxrees> it might.
[09:28:53] <robertmaxrees> the other one was grabbing the first item and checking the "checked" attribute.
[09:28:55] <robertmaxrees> not what you want.
[09:30:06] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian also, class=".feedback" isn't what you want.
[09:30:09] <robertmaxrees> class="feedback" is
[09:30:46] <Prometheian> kk, will note for future but I assume you that's not the issue I'm having in the code :P
[09:30:50] <Prometheian> assure*
[09:31:14] <decx> when's that "least of times" for attr() anyways
[09:31:24] <robertmaxrees> .text().trim().split('\n') isn't what you wnat in this case.
[09:31:32] <b-lew> thanks robertmaxrees that worked like a charm! I really appreciate the help!
[09:31:33] <robertmaxrees> decx when you actually want the markup.
[09:31:35] <decx> i thought about it and didnt come up with anything
[09:31:47] <robertmaxrees> it's fringe imo.
[09:31:54] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian check out your console.
[09:32:11] <decx> like the inline style attr, gets rerouted with prop too
[09:32:16] <Prometheian> For errors?
[09:32:22] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian yes
[09:32:47] <robertmaxrees> decx yeah, if you need the original value in the markup and you're using .prop() for evertyhing else.  like i said, it's fringe.
[09:32:49] <Prometheian> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[09:33:02] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian right - you see why?
[09:33:24] <damarusama> http://jsbin.com/zefekeke/1/edit
[09:33:32] <decx> hm right, like a bunch of defaults
[09:33:33] <damarusama> trying to get the price value of a select
[09:33:38] <Prometheian> ..no?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian your bigass method chain is busted.  let me show you a simpler way to do this.
[09:34:09] <Prometheian> kk ^^
[09:38:45] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian not perfect, but you get the idea: http://jsbin.com/wexiconi/1/edit
[09:38:49] <BillCriswell> I just got excited because I had a good idea, did some code to figure out if it was possible and now I totally forget the idea.
[09:39:14] <robertmaxrees> you could modify that regex to also replace any instance where you have more than one consecutive space.
[09:40:57] <BillCriswell> Dammit this is going to drive me crazy.
[09:41:11] <Prometheian> rob: You mean "  "?
[09:41:15] <robertmaxrees> that's the worst, BillCriswell
[09:41:17] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian huh?
[09:41:26] <Prometheian> Consecutive space?
[09:41:31] <robertmaxrees> no.  update the regex.
[09:41:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean more than one whitespace char.  2 or more spaces.
[09:42:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/wexiconi/1/edit
[09:43:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/sijodohe/1/edit <- this version does that and shows it in action.
[09:43:48] <robertmaxrees> also - generally when you use all caps for a var name, you're implying that's a constant value that you'll never change.
[09:44:19] <Prometheian> I had a mess of code that I'm working through, needed it to stand out. Will change for release :P
[09:44:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:44:46] <robertmaxrees> visually?  that's a strange way to do it.  but okay.
[09:45:49] <Prometheian> I'm using Visual Studio and it isn't the prettiest.
[09:45:54] <Prometheian> 2008*
[09:46:24] <robertmaxrees> aaaah yes, VS - my favorite IDE with the worst text editor ever
[09:46:40] <Prometheian> kk, so I have one more issue here
[09:47:00] <Prometheian> I will get multiple lines of data like "feedbackEntered entererName"
[09:47:08] <Prometheian> And currently they're all on one <li>
[09:47:32] <Prometheian> So I need to be able to throw [0, 1] into an li, [2, 3], etc
[09:47:40] <Prometheian> which is why I had that split \n
[09:48:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:48:15] <Prometheian> sec let me see what I can do to show
[09:48:20] <Goop> I'm confused.
[09:48:23] <robertmaxrees> so each individual line should be its own <li>?
[09:49:04] <robertmaxrees> Goop sup?
[09:49:05] <Prometheian> Kinda, sec.
[09:49:53] <Goop> this conversation confuses me.  but I'll survive.  Other than that.. making a DeParam was extremely trivial and I wonder why it's never been added.
[09:50:21] <Goop> handy for links intended to be handled via ajax/history plugins
[09:50:32] <Prometheian> robert: http://jsbin.com/gemeqosi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:50:38] <robertmaxrees> Goop probably the same reason you have a serailizer that goes to an array and not an object.
[09:50:59] <Prometheian> I end up with three lines of feedback on one single element.
[09:51:04] <mms_> hi there is link for android apk on this page http://49.40.2.94:8080/cgi-bin/gl_productpage.py but when I click on link the apk does not download but just the url changes in browser to apk link.  I am expecting it to download the apk file.
[09:51:15] <Prometheian> Thought I think they're always split by \n
[09:51:16] <mms_> is it due to some jquery that is being included on page ?
[09:51:21] <Goop> robertmaxrees: yah.
[09:51:48] <Prometheian> http://jsbin.com/qawofoca/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:53:38] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian slow down
[09:53:47] <Prometheian> You can see me code?
[09:53:50] <robertmaxrees> yes
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian you want each newline to be in its own <li>?
[09:54:21] <Prometheian> No, it should be every other newline if the code correctly removes all newlines and spaces.
[09:54:38] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian where are you getting this data from?
[09:54:59] <Prometheian> Messy, generated HTML from C# backend.
[09:55:05] <robertmaxrees> something here seems... funky.
[09:55:09] <Prometheian> I'm moving things around on a page.
[09:56:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.  why are you putting them into a UL in the frontent instead of your backend?
[09:56:34] <robertmaxrees> *frontend.  this is going to be really fragile at this point.
[09:56:35] <Prometheian> Because editing the backend for this application is a nightmare, and I've been instructed to do this stuff in the frontend. I have all the crap working as I want except this.
[09:56:59] <SlimPDX> .w 8
[09:57:00] <b-ot> SlimPDX: No cities match your search query
[09:57:03] <Prometheian> And that's only because IE8 won't render my javascript forloop's <li> stuff properly.
[09:57:07] <SlimPDX> oh oops
[09:57:55] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian ew.  good luck then.
[09:58:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What does this mean? For performance reasons, the Tooltip and Popover data-apis are opt-in, meaning you must initialize them yourself.
[09:58:07] <Prometheian> Yeah, but can I not get this to play nice?
[09:58:23] <systemfault> Prometheian: What is the expected result? (Just curious)
[09:58:25] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian you can, but it's going to be super fragile and break really easily.
[09:58:48] <Prometheian> Fragile is fine, this is only going to one client w/ a fairly static page rendering.
[09:58:54] <damarusama> how I can get the attr() of multiple selectd value from a dropdown
[09:58:56] <Prometheian> Result? An overall nicer looking page.
[09:59:17] <Prometheian> If I had started in the backend I'd of just stayed in there, but supervisor said so I did.
[09:59:41] <damarusama> I can easily get the val() with var selectedVal = $('.multipleSelect').val()
[09:59:42] <robertmaxrees> ecky--ptang-zoob it means that you need initialize things yourself because it'd be slow otherwise.
[09:59:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> define "things" ?
[10:00:04] <damarusama> but I can't do the same with attr
[10:00:06] <robertmaxrees> ecky--ptang-zoob dunno - where'd you get the line from?
[10:00:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> bootstrap
[10:00:44] <robertmaxrees> ecky--ptang-zoob you're not making much sense.  it says exactly what it means.  what are you confused by?
[10:00:47] <Hausas> This is weird. $(this).closest("div").children().removeAttr("disabled"); doesn't remove disabled from a button
[10:00:49] <robertmaxrees> damarusama huh?
[10:00:55] <Hausas> even though it is part of the children
[10:00:57] <robertmaxrees> Hausas use .prop()
[10:00:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> WHAT do I need to initialize
[10:01:07] <robertmaxrees> Hausas use .prop('disabled', true)
[10:01:22] <robertmaxrees> ecky--ptang-zoob Tooltip and Popover it looks like.
[10:01:26] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: I have a dropdown with multiple selected value - I want to retreive all of the value
[10:01:41] <robertmaxrees> damarusama can you make a fiddle or bin showing what you've got sow far?
[10:01:54] <damarusama> ok 2 sec
[10:02:03] <jsc802> hello
[10:02:10] <jsc802> ive got a basic jquery question
[10:02:21] <jsc802> if i change the src of an image using jquery
[10:02:28] <jsc802> will the browser still load the original one?
[10:02:43] <jsc802> i am trying to prevent bandwidth use
[10:02:52] <damarusama> http://jsbin.com/fonazuma/1/edit
[10:02:56] <Hausas> prop messes up my code
[10:03:03] <Hausas> It refreshes the page
[10:03:07] <Hausas> for unknown reasong
[10:03:11] <Hausas> *reasons
[10:03:49] <damarusama> so far I have a multiple select, and can retrieve the first 'price' of the selected item
[10:04:05] <damarusama> I would like to retrieve all the 'price' or simply sum them up ;)
[10:05:27] <Hausas> I always find why stuff happens after I post the question here
[10:06:57] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: any ideas?
[10:07:23] <jsc802> anyone know?
[10:07:34] <robertmaxrees> sorry I was in a meeting.
[10:07:50] <robertmaxrees> Hausas it... shouldn't break anything if you use prop
[10:08:10] <METEMEDO> jsc802: that depends
[10:08:12] <Hausas> I know it sounds weird, but it does
[10:08:18] <PantsOfChoco> whats the best way to use jquery to delete a value from a query string, or more specifically every value with the name 'test'
[10:08:19] <robertmaxrees> Hausas it shouldn't at all.
[10:08:37] <Hausas> :D
[10:09:01] <METEMEDO> jsc802: imagine this: your html has <img src="img1.jpg" />
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco don'e use jquery for that.
[10:09:10] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: Why are you doing this in javascript at all?
[10:09:18] <METEMEDO> after that you change with jquery to img2.jpg
[10:09:43] <PantsOfChoco> cause I GOT NO WHERE ELSE TO GOOOO
[10:09:47] <METEMEDO> but when the browser loading reaches the jquery, it has already loaded the img1
[10:10:02] <METEMEDO> because jquery is AFTER the <img tag
[10:10:04] <PantsOfChoco> but seriously i have no idea what other way to do it
[10:10:06] <jsc802> ah
[10:10:13] <PantsOfChoco> alot of my website is in ajax calls
[10:10:16] <jsc802> if i put it before the image tag it wont load it tho?
[10:10:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/nubavega/1/edit damarusama
[10:10:24] <PantsOfChoco> that only update certain parts of a page
[10:10:25] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[10:11:17] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: How are they getting these in the first place?
[10:11:32] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: that give the val - I need the price
[10:11:38] <damarusama> that's why I use the attr()
[10:11:51] <PantsOfChoco> well they querystring is used in passing to django for parsing retrieving values
[10:11:57] <damarusama> which doesn't behave the same for multiselect compared to the attr
[10:12:04] <damarusama> the val
[10:12:11] <robertmaxrees> damarusama price is not a valid attribute.
[10:12:20] <Hausas> Screw it
[10:12:23] <Hausas> I'm going home
[10:12:24] <robertmaxrees> look now, damarusama
[10:12:29] <robertmaxrees> ytou want value=
[10:13:01] <damarusama> right- I wanted to keep value to process the form and send email with that value... but I guess I can use something else
[10:13:02] <BillCriswell> PantsOfChoco: Yeah, but if you're requesting things with ajax not sure how tge query string ends up in the url for you to see it.
[10:13:14] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell if you're using the history API...
[10:13:38] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: so with the val() there is no way to use the 'price' right?
[10:13:56] <robertmaxrees> damarusama price is not a valid attribute in HTML - you can't use it anyway
[10:14:19] <damarusama> yeah I didn't mind that as long as jquery could pull the data
[10:14:28] <damarusama> ok will go with that
[10:14:31] <robertmaxrees> damarusama you SHOULD mind that.
[10:14:42] <robertmaxrees> invalid html is a bad thing.  just because it "works" is a terrible reason.
[10:15:07] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: In that case wouldn't they have to explicitly set the url?
[10:15:13] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: how would you go about having a title and a price to an option for a multiselect
[10:15:14] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell very true
[10:15:33] <damarusama> I want to use the price for calculation and the title to create an email with that information
[10:16:21] <robertmaxrees> damarusama it sounds like what you really need is to create an object elsewhere that stores all your data and use the value attributes to correspond to the keys in that object.
[10:16:46] <jsc802> can someone help me with a simple javascript/jquery question
[10:16:47] <damarusama> yeah that's what I've seen
[10:17:01] <damarusama> jsc802: maybe
[10:17:06] <jsc802> i have href="/resize?po=http://d20wgm7uzi3pjv.cloudfront.net" and i want to get rid of '/resize?po='
[10:17:08] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ jsc802
[10:17:08] <b-ot> jsc802: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:17:09] <damarusama> robertmaxrees: ok thanks ;)
[10:17:20] <jsc802> this.href = this.href.replace("\/resize?po=", ""); isnt working
[10:17:50] <jsc802> it returns https://store9711.americommerce.comhttp//d20wgm7uzi3pjv.cloudfront.net
[10:18:31] <dglambert> Anyone else having problems with jsfiddle.net
[10:18:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.  it's downish.  jsbin is up.
[10:18:59] <dglambert> ty
[10:19:35] <dmsuperman> damarusama: alternatively you could store the values in attributes
[10:19:55] <dmsuperman> damarusama: <option value="id" data-price="5.54">Some Name</option>
[10:19:56] <robertmaxrees> in data-attributes, yeah, but that gets a little hairy as you add data.
[10:20:24] <dmsuperman> well as long as you know that adding data no longer references the DOM attribute I don't see why it would be different than an external global object
[10:20:46] <robertmaxrees> it gets unwieldy pretty quick in my experience.
[10:21:00] <robertmaxrees> the markup generation side gets funky.
[10:21:04] <robertmaxrees> and harder to read imo.
[10:21:07] <dmsuperman> how so? Not in my experience
[10:21:36] <robertmaxrees> with up to maybe 4 or 5.
[10:21:54] <robertmaxrees> any more and it gets really hard to work with irt your backend.
[10:22:33] <dmsuperman> we're talking about one attribute here though :P
[10:22:35] <dmsuperman> slippery slope
[10:22:41] <jsc802> oh i think i figured it out
[10:22:53] <jsc802> this.href is different from $(this).attr('href')
[10:22:57] <dmsuperman> even still it depends on your backend. Mine allows me to easily just add extra data attributes via arrays
[10:23:24] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman eh, then it gets into performance considerations - why make jquery do all that work to create the cache?
[10:23:33] <Prometheian> Prometheian
[10:23:37] <Prometheian> crap
[10:23:38] <dmsuperman> dmsuperman:
[10:23:47] <Prometheian> dumb irc client
[10:23:53] <dglambert> ugh I don't like jsbin
[10:23:56] <dmsuperman> robertmaxrees: why does jquery have to be involved tehn?
[10:24:11] <dmsuperman> just saying it's not like universally bad or good
[10:24:34] <dmsuperman> if you just want to add a quick attribute for something like calculating things based on a drop down
[10:25:03] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman i never said it was universally bad or good - i'm just used to looking down the road 5 months when somebody inevitably wants to add more.
[10:25:14] <dmsuperman> well that works for every piece of code ever
[10:25:14] <robertmaxrees> that's all.  nothing wrong with getting a good foundation.
[10:26:00] <dmsuperman> right, you're claiming that it's not a good foundation. that's what I'm disagreeing with. agree to disagree I suppose
[10:26:21] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[10:26:50] <mms_> here is page using jquery mobile and when I click a link on page it gives some error .  http://49.40.2.94:8080/cgi-bin/gl_productpage.py
[10:27:14] <mms_> the error is jquery related which you can see in chrome console
[10:27:32] <mms_> a.ui-link related it is
[10:27:36] <dmsuperman> What is the error mms_
[10:27:37] <mms_> any idea what to do to fix it ?
[10:27:59] <dmsuperman> because I don't see a JS error, I'm getting a 404 error for your references to the JS files
[10:28:00] <mms_> dmsuperman: if you ope that page and do F12 in chrome browser you can see if you click the android link
[10:28:23] <dmsuperman> No, I don't
[10:28:43] <dmsuperman> I do get these on page load however http://i.imgur.com/H0tBY8I.png
[10:28:51] <mms_> dmsuperman: no some thing wrong at your end I guess its opening fine for me
[10:29:19] <mms_> dmsuperman: which js file ?
[10:29:26] <dmsuperman> look at my screenshot
[10:29:37] <dmsuperman> here's the URL it's trying to load: http://49.40.2.94:8080/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[10:29:43] <dmsuperman> which is clearly a server side 404
[10:30:27] <mms_> dmsuperman: I am not getting that error
[10:30:31] <dmsuperman> you're forgetting the type="text/javascript" on your script references
[10:30:44] <dmsuperman> your browser must be compensating for that for you
[10:31:23] <mms_> dmsuperman: ok I can add them but I opened in chrome and I did not get error
[10:31:39] <robertmaxrees> http://49.40.2.94:8080/js/jquery-1.10.2.min
[10:31:42] <robertmaxrees> that should work
[10:31:50] <robertmaxrees> but does not.
[10:32:01] <mms_> robertmaxrees: what ?
[10:32:07] <mms_> that file not opening ?
[10:32:20] <dmsuperman> fix your markup mms_ it's causing issues trying to load the wrong URLs
[10:32:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the jquery file references are bad.
[10:32:51] <mms_> dmsuperman: so its just markup issue ?
[10:33:02] <mms_> robertmaxrees: says the file references are bad
[10:33:10] <robertmaxrees> <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
[10:33:18] <dmsuperman> not sure. fix them and see
[10:33:19] <robertmaxrees> you need an extra / in front of the src value
[10:33:23] <mms_> well when I opened in chrome cosole it shows all loaded fine
[10:33:32] <robertmaxrees> we cannot help you if you do not fix it.
[10:36:15] <PantsOfChoco> new question since i cant figure out my old one how do i get all values in query string with the same name
[10:36:35] <dmsuperman> PantsOfChoco: example?
[10:36:58] <PantsOfChoco> like ?test=1&test=2&test=3
[10:37:10] <PantsOfChoco> i want to basically get all values from that
[10:37:13] <PantsOfChoco> test = 1,2,3
[10:37:17] <PantsOfChoco> or delete them if possible haha
[10:37:18] <dmsuperman> are you surey ou don't mean test[] ?
[10:37:31] <dmsuperman> test=1&test=2 to the server side generally just means "test=2" and that's it
[10:37:31] <dmsuperman> no 1
[10:37:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange URL>
[10:37:47] <PantsOfChoco> in django you can get a list
[10:37:58] <dmsuperman> hrm, ok
[10:38:00] <PantsOfChoco> getlist returns all matching values
[10:38:09] <robertmaxrees> aaah yeah.
[10:38:10] <dmsuperman> well here's a snippet to fetch query string variables: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2090551/parse-query-string-in-javascript
[10:38:17] <dmsuperman> where you see the return statement, make that add it to an array
[10:38:21] <dmsuperman> then return the whole array
[10:39:54] <PantsOfChoco> would this be best as a regex?
[10:40:02] <PantsOfChoco> if i want to delete it
[10:40:16] <dmsuperman> You could do it with a regex too yeah
[10:40:18] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco how are you building that string up?
[10:40:29] <damarusama> how can I create a var name with another variable ? var this + that = somthing ?
[10:40:39] <robertmaxrees> damarusama you cannot.
[10:40:48] <PantsOfChoco> theres weird ways to do it
[10:40:48] <robertmaxrees> damarusama you can dynamically create property names though.
[10:40:51] <PantsOfChoco> i actually do it
[10:40:52] <dmsuperman> damarusama: you can use a variable in an object prop
[10:40:53] <dmsuperman> ah yes
[10:41:06] <robertmaxrees> there are hacky ways to do it on the window object, sure, but that's not a wonderful idea.
[10:41:21] <PantsOfChoco> you mean multi variable names?
[10:41:23] <dmsuperman> a+'something' isn't valid but myVars[a+'something'] is
[10:41:31] <PantsOfChoco> yea
[10:41:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:41:39] <PantsOfChoco> if you do it in a dictionary it works
[10:41:41] <damarusama> ho, so while trough an interation I can't create new variable on the fly with the value of my counter
[10:41:44] <PantsOfChoco> i have some code around here like that
[10:41:47] <robertmaxrees> *object.  js doesn't have dictionaries ;)
[10:41:57] <dmsuperman> with the VALUE or the NAME damarusama?
[10:42:04] <PantsOfChoco> DONT YOU SASS ME!
[10:42:08] <dmsuperman> or you mean the value in the name?
[10:42:08] <damarusama> the name
[10:42:16] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco :)
[10:42:19] <PantsOfChoco> associateArray['marker'+String(i)] = name; something like that worked for me
[10:42:20] <dmsuperman> no not unless you make your variable a property of an object
[10:42:35] <PantsOfChoco> im terrible at javascript though
[10:42:37] <damarusama> right and then you can change that property
[10:42:38] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco *object again, we don't really have associate arrays either :)
[10:42:51] <PantsOfChoco> haha thats my code and what i named it
[10:43:04] <dmsuperman> yes damarusama myVars['a'+counter] = 'derp'; console.log(myVars['a'+someCounter]);
[10:43:32] <PantsOfChoco> ha im terrible and i beat someone helpful! take that professionals HACKISH ALL THE WAY
[10:43:53] <PantsOfChoco> and yea i use location.search to get the current querystring
[10:44:00] <PantsOfChoco> probably super hackish
[10:44:12] <dmsuperman> no that's correct iirc
[10:44:30] <PantsOfChoco> and from that i want to delete every instance of the word test
[10:44:33] <PantsOfChoco> and its value
[10:44:35] <PantsOfChoco> basically
[10:44:37] <dmsuperman> well
[10:45:06] <dmsuperman> .replace(/(\?|\&)test=([^$\&]+)/, '')
[10:45:08] <dmsuperman> something like that
[10:45:27] <dmsuperman> maybe needs a modifier to match all of them instead of just the first
[10:46:21] <PantsOfChoco> yea that worked for the first
[10:46:27] <PantsOfChoco> just gotta do it multiple times with that haha
[10:46:30] <dmsuperman> that's not quite ideal since it breaks ?test=d though
[10:46:45] <dmsuperman> make it /g though and that will make it do all matches
[10:46:50] <dmsuperman> .replace(/(\?|\&)test=([^$\&]+)/g, '')
[10:47:08] <PantsOfChoco> haha that added more~
[10:47:12] <PantsOfChoco> or brought the one back
[10:47:17] <dmsuperman> that will work as long as you only run it on the part after the ?
[10:47:24] <dmsuperman> ? you're confused
[10:47:28] <dmsuperman> that wouldn't add anything
[10:47:38] <PantsOfChoco> haha i mean
[10:47:47] <PantsOfChoco> the first one eliminated teh first instance
[10:47:52] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you have a querystring param after all the tests?
[10:47:56] <PantsOfChoco> the second regex showed it anyway
[10:48:06] <PantsOfChoco> a querystring named param?
[10:48:16] <PantsOfChoco> like param = 123?
[10:48:18] <robertmaxrees> a parameter after the test= ones.
[10:48:33] <PantsOfChoco> oh i wanna keep it
[10:48:53] <PantsOfChoco> and that regex seems to hold them if i understand it because it breaks on apersands
[10:49:14] <robertmaxrees> ?test=1&test=2&test=3&someThingElse=ninjas - the regex getting tossed around will leave you with &someThingElse=ninjas, when you need ?someThingElse=ninjas
[10:49:35] <dmsuperman> here's a really dirty solution basically: 'a=b&b=c&c=d&a=derp&something=eooo'.replace(/\&?a=([^$\&]+)/g, '').replace(/\&+/g, '&').replace(/^\&/, '')
[10:49:42] <dmsuperman> and it only works on location.search
[10:49:51] <dmsuperman> if you want to support the whole URL I would do more than just regex
[10:49:55] <dmsuperman> I would make it an array
[10:50:03] <robertmaxrees> this is where having an array of params would be helpful.
[10:50:08] <PantsOfChoco> its just he locationsearch
[10:50:14] <aitiba> hi
[10:50:20] <superjacaman> hey guys
[10:50:40] <PantsOfChoco> yess more people i can help with my hackish coding ahhaha
[10:50:45] <aitiba> is I use window.dato = "data" I coul use this data on the next pages of this window right?
[10:50:54] <robertmaxrees> aitiba no.
[10:51:06] <robertmaxrees> you cannot attach random persistent data like that.
[10:51:08] <dmsuperman> for that you need to use cookies
[10:51:15] <dmsuperman> or something like them
[10:51:18] <robertmaxrees> or localstorage
[10:51:24] <robertmaxrees> or something in your backend
[10:51:43] <dmsuperman> I've never used localstorage is it just like a big JSON cookie?
[10:51:49] <superjacaman> yeah
[10:52:08] <robertmaxrees> sorta, yeah.
[10:52:17] <PantsOfChoco> and robert it wont happen that way in my code i realized, because the page the user is on already ahs a querystring that should always be first.
[10:52:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage
[10:52:35] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco huh?
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> this is why i like throwing around data so much :)
[10:53:33] <aitiba> robertmaxrees: dmarr thanks I'm looking for cookies on javascript
[10:53:35] <PantsOfChoco> haha its hard to explain my code is strange and crazy but its gonna be super cool at least haha
[10:54:16] <PantsOfChoco> one other quick question though, how do i add a variable to a regex like if i have x = 'banana' i want the regex to to be /$x etc... but x be banana
[10:54:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to use the regexp object and generate it that way.
[10:54:39] <Jeffry> Hi guys.
[10:55:02] <Jeffry> Why can't I send messages in the "#javascript"-channel? I get the error "Cannot send message to channel, you are not voiced"?
[10:55:14] <dmsuperman> try ##javascript ?
[10:55:18] <dmsuperman> and/or identify
[10:55:24] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry you need to join the room explicitly, as well.
[10:55:28] <Jeffry> dmsuperman: I did. But I always get that error
[10:55:34] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco new RegExp("regex string","g");
[10:55:35] <tejas-manohar> hey guys, i need to run some jquery on form submission
[10:55:47] <tejas-manohar> im using the onsubmit=“” as said here - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082846/form-submit-execute-javascript-best-practice
[10:55:51] <dmsuperman> tejas-manohar: jquery.on with the "submit" event
[10:55:59] <Jeffry> The error only exists in that channel. But in this channel I can talk without problems
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry are you registered with nickserv?
[10:56:18] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes I am
[10:56:33] <robertmaxrees> and you're currently logged in?
[10:56:55] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes I am
[10:57:04] <PantsOfChoco> var re = new RegExp("/\&?provider=([^$\&]+)","g");  like that? but how do i replace provider with whatever variable i want?
[10:57:15] <dmsuperman> it's a string PantsOfChoco
[10:57:20] <Jeffry> Jeffry: I identified with "/msg NickServ identify pw"
[10:57:23] <dmsuperman> so put it into the string how you would normally put variables into a string
[10:57:23] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco go check out the docs
[10:57:31] <drej> Jeffry are you talking to yourself?
[10:57:32] <PantsOfChoco> regexs hurt my brain even during college
[10:57:37] <PantsOfChoco> hahahahah drej
[10:57:42] <Jeffry> drej: You're right :)
[10:57:49] <robertmaxrees>  new RegExp("\&?" + x + "=([^$\&]+)","g");
[10:58:02] <Jeffry> drej: I'm so desperate that I'm finally talking to myself
[10:58:13] <drej> Jeffry admitting it is the first step to recovery
[10:58:24] <aitiba> the cookies on js is used document.cookie right?
[10:58:32] <robertmaxrees> !javascript cookies
[10:58:35] <Jeffry> drej: I have no idea why I can't send any message in the javascript-channel. I'm doing nothing wrong
[10:58:50] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript cookies
[10:58:51] <dmsuperman> try restarting your client
[10:58:52] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript Cookies - W3Schools → http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp
[10:58:56] <drej> because you're not auth'd with nickserv
[10:58:57] <robertmaxrees> ugh not w3schools
[10:58:58] <dmsuperman> I just sent a message in there without voice Jeffry
[10:59:01] <tejas-manohar> dmsuperman: i have an html form and im loading validate.js (my own file) from a script tag in the <head> and in validate.js, on form submission, i need to check if the url from one of the form fields submitted is legit or not
[10:59:18] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry are you trying to send a message to the channel, or a message while in the channel?
[10:59:30] <dmsuperman> tejas-manohar: Right, you can bind an event to the form's submit handler via the jquery .on method
[10:59:48] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I'm in the channel and I see the message of dmsuperman, but I can't send any message
[10:59:49] <dmsuperman> then in that event handler you can do your validation, show any errors if so, and if you return false it will stop the form from submitting
[10:59:51] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar $('form').on('submit', function() { /* your code here */ });
[11:00:03] <tejas-manohar> ah
[11:00:23] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry dunno what we can do to help here.  we're not affiliated with them.  maybe reach out to the ops over there?
[11:00:25] <superjacaman> .submit should work too
[11:00:28] <poseidon> Any suggestions for a free ajax infinite scrolling plugin?
[11:00:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check everything.
[11:00:43] <superjacaman> poseidon: infinite scroll ?
[11:00:43] <robertmaxrees> superjacaman .submit is just a convenience method for what I put above.
[11:00:50] <superjacaman> yeah
[11:00:53] <dmsuperman> poseidon: the backend is the bigger concern, many backend plugins provide the javascript for you automatically
[11:00:54] <superjacaman> shorter better.
[11:01:00] <Jeffry> But I changed my IP, removed all cookies, registered a new user. So how can they block me? With which technique?
[11:01:03] <tejas-manohar> how do i grab the url submi,tted by the form?
[11:01:07] <tejas-manohar> ik how to check if its real
[11:01:15] <dmsuperman> with the .find method
[11:01:18] <dmsuperman> and the .val method
[11:01:31] <dmsuperman> inside the event handler this is a reference to the form
[11:01:33] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry i'm not saying they blocked you - if you're not actually logged in, that's an iossue.
[11:01:34] <robertmaxrees> *issue
[11:02:08] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: But 1) Why do I have only problems with that channel and 2) Why is dmsuperman able to send into that channel? So I suppose they blocked me
[11:02:16] <dmsuperman> I am authed
[11:02:24] <dmsuperman> The error indicates it's not a block
[11:02:31] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry it sounds like you're not logged in
[11:02:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check to make sure you're not getting any errors.
[11:02:52] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I did register and then "/msg NickServ identify pw". Isn't this logging in?
[11:02:53] <tejas-manohar> have an example of how to grab value subimtted in a certain <input> of the form i have that listener on?
[11:03:03] <dmsuperman> did nickserv give you an error?
[11:03:09] <Jeffry> dmsuperman: No
[11:03:11] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry did you get a confirmation from nickserv that you logged in?
[11:03:18] <dmsuperman> then I blame your client, try switching
[11:03:29] <dmsuperman> or restarting
[11:03:45] <Jeffry> dmsuperman: I already tried out several clients. The same problem
[11:03:56] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry then you're not actually registered/logged in.
[11:03:57] <dmsuperman> then you should probably ask irc help
[11:04:07] <dmsuperman> /join #help
[11:04:36] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar $('#inputIDHere').val();
[11:04:48] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar check out learn.jquery.com - it's a pretty solid tutorial.
[11:05:10] <superjacaman> tejas-manohar: what you want to do?
[11:05:30] <tejas-manohar> superjacaman: im just chceking some stuff before sbumitting to the backend
[11:05:40] <superjacaman> validating ?
[11:05:56] <superjacaman> i said that you want to check de url is submiting
[11:07:01] <Goop> if I have a long blob of html, how can I pull a specific element by class or id from it?
[11:07:11] <Jeffry> Guys. The help-guys told me that the "javascript" channel is in "moderated mode" and that I have to be "voiced". Do you know how to do that?
[11:07:30] <robertmaxrees> Goop make it into a fragment and run .find() on it.
[11:07:35] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry ask them.
[11:07:42] <robertmaxrees> we're not affiliated with ##javascript.
[11:07:48] <drej> Jeffry ask in #freenode dude
[11:08:04] <Goop> I tried find. :(
[11:08:06] <drej> Jeffry and its not moderated
[11:08:07] <tejas-manohar> superjacaman: yeah some small validations on the frontend
[11:08:14] <drej> Jeffry you have to register your nickname, and authenticate with nickserv
[11:08:21] <BillCriswell> You might just have to register.
[11:08:24] <robertmaxrees> Goop $('yourHTMLStringHere').find('theElement')
[11:08:25] <BillCriswell> Scrolled too late.
[11:08:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:08:36] <superjacaman> tejas-manohar: do you know the validate plugin... it is pretty cool.
[11:08:41] <Goop> yah :(
[11:08:46] <tejas-manohar> yes
[11:08:48] <Goop> tried that, no success.
[11:08:50] <tejas-manohar> oh wait no
[11:08:50] <Goop> very strange.
[11:08:54] <robertmaxrees> Goop create a fiddle or bin, then.
[11:09:03] <tejas-manohar> but i mean all im doing is checking if a url is legit
[11:09:09] <tejas-manohar> so its probably best to aviod a plugin
[11:09:47] <BillCriswell> Figuring out if a url is legic nowadays is quite an exercise.
[11:10:03] <aitiba> I put document.cookie = "name=oeschger"; on one page and on other an alert(document.cookie) but is empty why?
[11:10:15] <robertmaxrees> aitiba because that's not a valid cookie.
[11:10:16] <BillCriswell> Not even sure if it's worth it to check for anything more than a dot haha
[11:10:29] <robertmaxrees> bind to submit, prevent the default submission action, verify the input you want, then submit the form.
[11:10:29] <tejas-manohar> is it possible to $(‘by the input’s name instead of class’)
[11:10:40] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar yes - attribute selector.
[11:10:43] <apipkin> Is there no longer a distinction between MSPointerEvents and mouse events in jQuery? http://jsbin.com/vibahi/1/edit
[11:10:55] <aitiba> robertmaxrees: needs an expirates?
[11:11:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery's events are not the same as native events, apipkin
[11:11:14] <robertmaxrees> aitiba http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
[11:11:44] <tejas-manohar> var url = $('("[name='url']" )').val();
[11:11:57] <BillCriswell> tejas-manohar: Too much (
[11:11:59] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar no.
[11:12:07] <BillCriswell> $('[name=url]') would be just fine.
[11:12:18] <mms_> robertmaxrees: back....
[11:12:32] <mms_> I do not know what the issue is.. why those scripts will not load
[11:12:42] <tejas-manohar> var url = $("[name='url']").val();
[11:12:42] <mms_> I see in firefox they do not show any errors
[11:12:43] <tejas-manohar> ?
[11:12:45] <robertmaxrees> mms_ i told you earlier.  the relative URL is bad.
[11:12:45] <tejas-manohar> alright
[11:12:48] <mms_> in chrome I do those errors
[11:12:48] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: found it. IE11 has normalized the event to the “standard” and dropped the prefix, so it is now ‘pointerdown’ instead of ‘MSPointerDown'
[11:13:03] <robertmaxrees> apipkin that shouldn't have mattered before.
[11:13:37] <mms_> robertmaxrees: seems some thing to do with way I am using it...I am actually generating that html using cgi script from cgi-bin dir....then to html page I applied base tag and serve the js, images, css etc. from doc root
[11:13:55] <mms_> thing is with cgi-bin serving that html is causing issues may be
[11:14:14] <mms_> robertmaxrees: please see in firefox also ....I do not see any errors
[11:14:42] <robertmaxrees> mms_ i primarily use ff - the scripts were not laoding at all.  i explained the issue to you.  i cannot help you until you resolve the relative URLs.
[11:14:51] <poseidon> dmsuperman: Do you know of a plugin that works with ZF 1.12?
[11:14:54] <Jeffry> One question: Now there is the framework "Jquery" which implements Ajax. Would it make sense to learn all the details about Ajax / use Ajax instead of Jquery?
[11:15:14] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry jQuery is more of a library, and what are you asking specifically?
[11:15:46] <mms_> robertmaxrees: those map files are not there on server at all...there are js files only...
[11:16:02] <robertmaxrees> mms_ the js file links are invalid and sending me to 404 pages.
[11:16:16] <apipkin> robertmaxrees: I agree :) but it did in IE10. You had to bind to MSPointerDown. There was still a mousedown event that fired second afterward, but the pointer event was the one I was looking for
[11:16:20] <robertmaxrees> mms_ i don't know how to phrase this any differently - your script tags are broken.
[11:16:28] <robertmaxrees> apipkin okay.
[11:16:31] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I mean one could read a whole book about Ajax. But why should I do it, if there is the high-level abstraction of it: Jquery?
[11:16:37] <mms_> http://49.40.2.94:8080/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
[11:16:51] <mms_> robertmaxrees: these are the js files...I am not sure where we seeing other js files
[11:16:56] <mms_> its loading fine
[11:16:56] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry so you understand how ajax works.  abstractions are great for convenience.
[11:17:21] <mms_> do view source to confirm the js files
[11:17:29] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes. But as a student I have limited time. So I can only learn one thing at a time. Ajax would take all vacation long
[11:17:34] <robertmaxrees> mms_ you're not listening to me.
[11:17:36] <mms_> I do see errors in chrome you mention but not sure where they come from
[11:17:49] <mms_> robertmaxrees: I tried to do changes you said but it did not solve
[11:17:53] <BillCriswell> mms_: It sounds like you're confusing about the map files.
[11:18:01] <mms_> BillCriswell: yes I do not know them
[11:18:21] <mms_> BillCriswell: firefox is not showing any such issue but chrome does report it
[11:18:33] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I don't understand why we should use Ajax anymore? Why doing everything low-level?
[11:18:47] <BillCriswell> mms_: What files are being requested?
[11:18:53] <robertmaxrees> mms_ using jquery's abstraction is just an abstraction.
[11:19:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you should use the underlying object.
[11:19:07] <robertmaxrees> mms_ http://i.imgur.com/2njKnWl.png
[11:19:14] <robertmaxrees> this is your problem.
[11:19:28] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Why is this my problem?
[11:19:38] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry i'm talking to mms_
[11:19:51] <robertmaxrees> mms_ those urls need a / in front of them
[11:19:58] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Ok sorry. I'm only trying to get some attention like a child ^^
[11:20:07] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry what do you need?
[11:20:07] <mms_> robertmaxrees: I added and it did not solve things
[11:20:24] <Jeffry> I only need to know what you guys use in your job / reality. Ajax or Jquery?
[11:20:27] <robertmaxrees> mms_ as it stands right now, you are not loading any javascript on that page.  start by fixing that.
[11:20:38] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry i use jquery for ajax, yes.
[11:20:59] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Ok. That's what I wanted to know :). Thx.
[11:21:01] <robertmaxrees> they are not mutuall exclusive things.  you should learn what the underlying mechanics
[11:21:06] <robertmaxrees> *are doing
[11:21:27] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes. But learning all about Ajax would take me a long time, several months. I've limited time
[11:21:44] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry as long as you eventually learn it.
[11:21:45] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I only have time for learning Jquery
[11:22:12] <Jattenalle> Jeffry, your question doesnt make sense
[11:22:13] <mms_> robertmaxrees: please note the base tag....
[11:22:23] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I've a bad feeling about this, as I'm directly learning Jquery without knowing details about Ajax
[11:22:27] <robertmaxrees> mms_ click that link - see what happens.
[11:22:35] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry then what do you want from me?
[11:22:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not making much sense any more.
[11:22:59] <robertmaxrees> you should learn AJAX without jquery, and then you can use the abstraction jQuery provides.
[11:23:06] <mms_> robertmaxrees: I do not get any file for map file
[11:23:11] <tejas-manohar> hey guys, this is what i came up with with all your help :)
[11:23:12] <tejas-manohar> http://pastebin.com/sMYQxdjA
[11:23:13] <mms_> robertmaxrees: I do get file for js file
[11:23:16] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I'm only trying to find out in which case manual programming in Ajax is required nowadays.
[11:23:26] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry when jquery isn't available.
[11:23:38] <mms_> http://49.40.2.94:8080/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
[11:23:42] <mms_> this file shows up
[11:23:47] <Jattenalle> Jeffry, even with jquery you still need to understand return values, error codes, etc
[11:23:50] <robertmaxrees> mms_ that is not the link that is being referenced in your page source.
[11:23:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^ exactly.
[11:23:57] <Jattenalle> Jeffry, like i said, your question doesnt make sense..
[11:24:20] <Jattenalle> Jeffry, it's kind of like asking "What do people use to code websites? A keyboard or a monitor?"
[11:24:27] <Jattenalle> the answer is "both" and "neither" ?
[11:24:30] <Jattenalle> makes no sense
[11:24:30] <mms_> robertmaxrees: all images are showing up from doc root due to base tag
[11:24:41] <robertmaxrees> mmc i give up - you refuse to listen.
[11:25:14] <mms_> robertmaxrees: may be I just just try to use http url to internet sites for jquery and see
[11:25:25] <tejas-manohar> does this seem right guys? - http://pastebin.com/sMYQxdjA
[11:25:27] <Jeffry> Jattenalle: I know that Jquery contains Ajax. What I mean is the level of abstraction people do programming in. It's a difference if you do it manually by using the standard XHR (XML-HTTP-Request) from the Browser or if you use high-level-functions of Jquery to do your Ajax-stuff
[11:25:34] <tejas-manohar> and how do i make sure it doesnt send it to the server
[11:25:39] <tejas-manohar> need to send to jquery first
[11:25:55] <robertmaxrees> tejas-manohar e.preventDefault()
[11:25:59] <robertmaxrees> read up on that.
[11:26:08] <Jattenalle> Jeffry, not much of a difference... anyhow, no idea what you want to know or what you're asking.. good luck
[11:26:18] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry it entirely depends on the use case.
[11:26:26] <robertmaxrees> there is no single "silver bullet" answer
[11:27:17] <BillCriswell> Did I miss some werewolf converation.
[11:27:18] <robertmaxrees> for instance, I'm not going to include jquery in a project if all I need are the ajax abstractions.
[11:27:25] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Ok :). In my opinion this is like every topic in our branch. As an example: You can do high-level-network programming by using REST or SOAP-Services. But you can also do low-level-programming by using C-Sockets.
[11:27:51] <robertmaxrees> you should never use SOAP btw ;)
[11:27:58] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: And as long as you don't want to write something very special it is ok to take the high-level stuff
[11:28:24] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes. It eats up lots of ressource and isn't good for embedded devices. REST is much better
[11:28:39] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry huh? it's more much than that.
[11:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you're oversimplifying it.
[11:28:54] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: What do you mean?
[11:29:22] <robertmaxrees> " And as long as you don't want to write something very special it is ok to take the high-level stuff"
[11:29:24] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: You see. Don't misunderstand me. I like talking philosophical stuff about techniques, which might sound strange to some people
[11:29:36] <robertmaxrees> that statement is too broad.
[11:29:57] <robertmaxrees> hell, i'm a mod in this channel and i'll tell you that you shouldn't include jquery just for a single abstraction.  that's kind of silly imo.
[11:30:37] <Goop> so the issue was that I needed to use filter
[11:30:40] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: I used Jquery in my project only for getting JSON-Data from my REST-Webservice
[11:30:48] <Goop> as the blob is grabbed dynamically from html()
[11:31:19] <robertmaxrees> Jeffry that's kind of a waste.
[11:31:21] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[11:31:45] <Jeffry> robertmaxrees: Yes but high-level frameworks have better support of all browsers
[11:32:01] <robertmaxrees> enjoy yourselves.
[11:32:11] <Jeffry> ok.
[11:32:28] <Jeffry> sorry for my big mouth
[11:33:02] <dglambert> hey I have this snippet $('a').on('click',
[11:33:19] <dglambert> Can I also confine it to a certain div
[11:33:27] <dglambert> including children
[11:33:45] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Through a parent selector for the a
[11:33:57] <BillCriswell> dglambert: $('.some-div a')
[11:34:05] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Just like CSS
[11:34:08] <dglambert> kk
[11:34:11] <dglambert> thanks
[11:34:58] <dglambert> ty
[11:35:40] <dglambert> oh can I apply it to decendants of that div?
[11:35:41] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[11:35:53] <BillCriswell> dglambert: It is applies to them.
[11:36:04] <dglambert> no go
[11:36:15] <dglambert> I applied it to an id though if that makes a difference
[11:38:35] <BillCriswell> dglambert: http://jsbin.com/felifohu/1/edit?html,js,output is what I assume you mean.
[11:40:11] <dglambert> yeah
[11:41:07] <Jeffry> Hey guys. I've found out that the theory about Ajax isn't much. It's only about 30 pages.
[11:41:23] <Jeffry> Ajax isn't that complex.
[11:42:45] <dglambert> http://codepad.org/3ljmVoh1 BillCriswell
[11:43:02] <dglambert> I'm using event here so maybe that has something to do with it
[11:43:03] <Jeffry> I thought that I have to read a book of 300 pages to understand it
[11:43:20] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: No way.
[11:43:56] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Is the link you're clicking a url on the same domain?
[11:43:58] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: It's only a bunch of functions and the xhr-object. That's all
[11:44:03] <dglambert> nope
[11:44:30] <Jeffry> dglambert: Why nope?
[11:44:45] <Jeffry> dglambert: Ah ok, you're answering Bill
[11:44:49] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: You're not very good at realizing who's talking to you haha
[11:45:05] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: I'm a little bit tired
[11:45:10] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Look at the network tab in your dev tools and see if the requet is being made.
[11:45:16] <dglambert> got it
[11:45:19] <Jeffry> I'm an old man
[11:45:38] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: Yeh I feel old on IRC.
[11:45:51] <BillCriswell> Especially since I started in IRC about 12 years ago.
[11:45:54] <dglambert> so the html I wanted to attach that jquery to is being loaded via ajax
[11:46:01] <dglambert> so i put it in that code
[11:46:17] <BillCriswell> dglambert: Oh, that's a different story then.
[11:46:27] <dglambert> yeah all good now, thanks
[11:46:34] <BillCriswell> Oh it works? Ok cool.
[11:46:59] <dglambert> yup, ty
[11:47:11] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:48:57] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: I really always thought: "Mh. Ajax. That has to be something really big and complex. I have to read hundreds of pages to understand every little detail of it". But know I realized the opposite and think I'm dreaming. Am I dreaming or is this reality?
[11:50:47] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: Ajax itself isn't too bad but working with it can be a little tricky in certain aspects. Waiting for things to finish really throws a lot of people for a loop.
[11:51:56] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Yeah. At the beginning you've to get used to the "asynchronous request", where the rest of your app just continous execution.
[11:52:16] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: I think that's the hardest part for people to follow usually.
[11:52:43] <Velveeta> wrapping your head around asynchronous requests is step 1... when you scale that up to wrapping your head around asynchronous code in general, then you start having real breakthroughs :)
[11:53:30] <BillCriswell> Yeah. It definitely gets interesting.
[11:53:34] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: What I meant and what people here misunderstood me in is: If I use Jquery then it's automatically recognizing the right Browser and I don't have to find it out on myself like in this example: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest
[11:53:51] <Velveeta> oh god yes
[11:54:06] <dmsuperman> that's about the only difference though Jeffry
[11:54:11] <Velveeta> that's the beauty of jquery, it abstracts away a lot of that browser stuff for you, in ajax, event attachments, etc
[11:54:14] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Then, if some new version of the browsers come out then things change and your old recognition code for browsers doesn't work anymore
[11:54:22] <dmsuperman> and is a 2 line function if you don't need the rest of jquery
[11:54:45] <Jeffry> Velveeta: Finnally you're the first person who understands my feelings :D. I feel relieved
[11:54:52] <Velveeta> and as of the latest releases of jquery, you can require in just the ajax portion if you don't need the rest of jquery
[11:54:54] <BillCriswell> This ajax example is for some rpetty old browsers. A lot of them have come around.
[11:55:32] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Yes. But do you understand?: If I use a high-level framework like Jquery I don't have to keep track of such changes
[11:55:51] <Velveeta> i don't think you'll find anybody in this room advocating against the use of jquery :D
[11:56:08] <Velveeta> well, in some situations, for sure, but when it comes to what it's designed for, probably not
[11:56:15] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: I understand.  I typically just include my own build of the stuff I need, mostly because I'm lazy.
[11:56:22] <Velveeta> like, you shouldn't write 20000 lines of spaghetti code with jquery
[11:56:31] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yes, duch was just saying if you just need ajax stuff you might not need all of jQuery.
[11:56:35] <BillCriswell> Er, robertmaxrees.
[11:56:51] * Velveeta gives his thumbs-up seal of approval.
[11:57:12] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: And how can I choose the ajax part and exclude the rest of the stuff?
[11:57:42] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: https://github.com/jquery/jquery#what-you-need-to-build-your-own-jquery
[11:58:41] <Jeffry> ok. Finally I'm really really happy to have talked to you guys. Now I'm really relieved.
[11:59:37] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: Probably just blowing things out of proportion. I do the same. So much easier when you actually try something instead of think about it.
[12:00:58] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: You're right. But it's always good to hear the experience of experts like you
[12:01:42] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Sometimes I need guys who tell me which way to go. Sometimes I lose my orientation
[12:02:22] <BillCriswell> I hope to one day be even remotely close to an expert haha.
[12:03:43] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: But this IRC will help you guys as well. You're confronted with new problems coming from stupid guys like me.
[12:03:44] <BillCriswell> I understand what you mean by direction though. Definitely good to know where to do.
[12:03:48] <BillCriswell> Especially in this field.
[12:04:20] <BillCriswell> Don't think anyone is really stupid, lazy mostly and sometimes confused but rarely stupid haha
[12:04:44] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Yes. I'm only saying that so that the guys I annoyed here today get a little bit happy :)
[12:05:11] <PantsOfChoco> party peopleeeeee
[12:05:24] <Jeffry> PantsOfChoco: party? wow :)
[12:05:36] <PantsOfChoco> i hate jquery
[12:05:41] <PantsOfChoco> thats my take from today
[12:05:45] <Jeffry> :D. Fine. You're in the right channel
[12:06:17] <BillCriswell> Jeffry: It's really hard to pick up the tone of someone on IRC, especially programmers. It can sound douchy but it rarely is, usually just very to the point.
[12:06:21] <PantsOfChoco> im always here i never leave
[12:06:36] <PantsOfChoco> idk bill sounds fairly doucheyyyyyyyy
[12:06:58] <BillCriswell> I'm sure I can at times!
[12:07:10] <Jeffry> BillCriswell: Yes that's the crazy thing about communicating via IRC. Everybody interprets different emotions out of the expressions of others, depending on the personal state of mind / emotions
[12:07:22] <coderdj412> Greetings
[12:07:36] <Jeffry> PantsOfChoco: Don't you go sleeping :)?
[12:16:48] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[12:19:15] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Whenever I read that I think of Charlie and his bitch ass Grandpa up in Willy Wonka's factory.
[12:19:32] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahahaha
[12:20:11] <BillCriswell> That kid sounded like a rat.
[12:20:45] <robertmaxrees> they were
[12:21:05] <BillCriswell> bedridden until he gets to go to a chocolate factory and no one even mentions it.
[12:21:12] <BillCriswell> Bothered me since I was a kid.
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> http://mycrowdedsky.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/why-grandpa-joe-is-a-jerk-a-willy-wonka-retrospective/ this made me laugh
[12:22:14] <drej> BillCriswell chocolate fixed his dehabilitating disease
[12:22:16] <drej> because its so damn good
[12:24:53] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: That nails it haha.
[12:25:49] <BillCriswell> I can't believe he made it home with the ticket after he got it. That ticket was in serious demand. He would have been robber so quick.
[12:26:45] <BillCriswell> robbed*
[12:27:14] <robertmaxrees> slugworth, yo
[12:28:31] <BillCriswell> creepy dude
[12:29:29] <robertmaxrees> hell if you think about it willy wonka is kind of twisted, too.  he decides that he wants to get rid of the company, so instead of going with somebody he can trust (like the people he's enslaved en masse or slugworth), he looks for a child.
[12:30:52] <BillCriswell> I was just referring to looks haha. I can understand wanting to leave it to a child since they have imagination.
[12:31:42] <BillCriswell> I mean... probably a terrible business move financially but ideas wise haha.
[12:31:51] <BillCriswell> You can guarantee Grandpa Joe was on those books.
[12:32:30] <coderdj412> What happen to the save button on jsfiddle
[12:32:46] <robertmaxrees> uh oh.
[12:33:15] <robertmaxrees> https://twitter.com/jsfiddle/
[12:33:24] <robertmaxrees> They turned it off temporarily.
[12:33:41] <BillCriswell> Useless feature.
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> they were getting DDoS'd
[12:34:04] <BillCriswell> I hate spammers.
[12:34:15] <BillCriswell> Internet AIDS
[12:34:26] <robertmaxrees> virulent jerkoffs.
[12:48:28] <decx> that explains today
[12:48:38] <decx> but what about last week
[12:57:58] <coderdj412> I have an autocomplete widget attached to a input element that is dynamically created thru an 'onclick' event
[12:58:42] <coderdj412> its not working what method should i look into to get it working
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[13:01:27] <PantsOfChoco> oh god running was a terrible idea during work
[13:01:39] <PantsOfChoco> ps who ddoses jsfiddle like what the hell
[13:01:47] <robertmaxrees> might not be malicious.,
[13:01:55] <PantsOfChoco> i hope its like jsbin
[13:03:41] <PantsOfChoco> trying to take down their rivals
[13:06:52] <PantsOfChoco> what do i do if i pass jquery a list and dont know the size, and want to use .each like .each wont work for a list with 1 value correct?
[13:07:07] <coderdj412> robertmaxrees: tried that: http://jsbin.com/defaludu/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:07:09] <robertmaxrees> if it's an array or object, it well.
[13:07:25] <dglambert> http://codepad.org/b3lXpQXw
[13:07:33] <robertmaxrees> coderdj412 do you see the errors in the console?
[13:07:35] <dglambert> So i have this ^^ simple script
[13:07:50] <dglambert> is there anyway in it I can link it to the jquery in my js file
[13:07:58] <dglambert> or does that need to be done in html
[13:08:08] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco but avoid using .each() if you can.
[13:09:49] <wa5ted> question regarding foudnation
[13:09:55] <wa5ted> is there a way to resize the top bar
[13:09:56] <wa5ted> height
[13:10:04] <wa5ted> without messing with default fiels
[13:10:06] <wa5ted> files
[13:10:27] <wa5ted> i added padding to an element and the top bar wont resize to that elements padding
[13:11:40] <dglambert> actually even better, is there anyway I can import the jquery library and then 'disconnect'
[13:12:01] <coderdj412> robertmaxrees: the button adding code works. i don't know how to get rid of that error. I tried using double quotes on the outside and single in the inner html but doesn't remove errors
[13:13:02] <itsrachelfish> Hi #jQuery !
[13:14:49] <itsrachelfish> When I console.log($('.some-selector')) in chrome I see...
[13:14:50] <itsrachelfish> [div.some-selector.other-class, div.some-selector.hello-world, prevObject: m.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: ".some-Selector", jquery: "1.11.1", constructor: function...]
[13:15:38] <itsrachelfish> Are those first two elements just computed by my browser, or is there a way to get those same strings?
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:16:21] <itsrachelfish> Like if I want to do an each() over my selector, is there any way inside that to get the string "div.some-selector.other-class" ?
[13:16:28] <itsrachelfish> Or is that something computed by chrome?
[13:16:57] <shoky> itsrachelfish it's just chrome's way of displaying that element in console
[13:17:17] <itsrachelfish> I see
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> what do you need that string for?
[13:17:36] <itsrachelfish> So if I want something similar I'd have to generate the string based on the node name/class names?
[13:18:02] <shoky> yup
[13:23:03] <dglambert> if i have a script in a div
[13:23:09] <dglambert> then I write over that script
[13:23:14] <dglambert> is it no longer valid
[13:24:03] <shoky> if it was loaded it stays loaded
[13:24:58] <dmsuperman> poseidon: No I don't you'll have to find your own backend plugin
[13:25:11] <dmsuperman> poseidon: there is no universal javascript though, it depends on the backend code
[13:25:34] <dglambert> kk
[13:30:00] <phoenixsun> is there jQuery function to convert seconds to the standard time format?
[13:30:12] <phoenixsun> some kind of wrapper
[13:30:13] <phoenixsun> ?
[13:30:16] <robertmaxrees> the date object in javascript should be able to do that.
[13:36:14] <Bray90820_> How would I align a div to the bottom of its parent but keeping its inline-block behavior
[13:47:37] <phoenixsun> I have explored the date object and using it isnt really more simple than running the maths because it doesnt do the formatting. You still end up with minutes and seconds separately.
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> there's also moment.js.
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing i'm aware of in jquery that does what you want.
[13:48:22] <phoenixsun> yeah I just read about that
[13:48:35] <phoenixsun> I was trying to keep the number of classes import low
[13:48:44] <phoenixsun> I will check and see if its lightweight
[13:48:49] <robertmaxrees> "classes import" ?
[13:48:59] <phoenixsun> libraries I mean
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:49:28] <robertmaxrees> if you're only doing one datetime dealio, then I'd just go manual.
[13:49:39] <phoenixsun> seems like it
[13:49:57] <phoenixsun> like thats the way to go I mean
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[13:52:39] <RhinoBoss> Is there a way to set up jquery tabs so that no tab is active by default? The "active" input to .tabs() requires an integer value, 0 based, where 0 is the first tab
[13:58:02] <RhinoBoss> Is there a way to set up jquery tabs so that no tab is active by default? The "active" input to .tabs() requires an integer value, 0 based, where 0 is the first tab
[13:58:21] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss not that i'm aware of.
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss you could init it without supplying a value, yeah?
[13:59:16] <RhinoBoss> ill try that
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> dunno if it'll work.
[14:00:10] <RhinoBoss> nope, it defaults to the fist tavb
[14:02:16] <coderdj412> robertmaxrees: its not an error just that the lints don't support ecma script 5 yet. i don't know how to turn it off in jsbin
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> coderdj412 hrm?
[14:07:14] <coderdj412> robertmaxrees: whats? hrm?
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're talking about.
[14:09:16] <Goop> regex of the day?
[14:09:33] <Goop> .replace(/(\<a)([^>]+)(href\=\")(?!mailto\:)([^">]+)(\")([^>]*)(\>)/ig,'$1$2$3$4$5$6 target="_blank">')
[14:09:35] <Goop> lol
[14:09:53] <Goop> matches all links that are not mailto and adds target="_blank"
[14:10:03] <coderdj412> robertmaxrees: the eol errors you pointed out in the jsbin script i forwared you
[14:10:36] <BillCriswell> Goop: Seems like a bit much?
[14:10:42] <Goop> probably so
[14:10:44] <Goop> but it does work
[14:10:58] <Goop> and is faster than trying to filter it out with dom matching and what not.
[14:11:32] <BillCriswell> Hm, I'd like to test that.
[14:11:34] <Goop> it comes from a string blob.  so there is a lot of grunt work involved to filter/replace
[14:11:43] <Goop> I challenge you to tidy the regex! hehe
[14:13:16] <BillCriswell> Haha no way.
[14:13:37] <Goop> come on, you know it's "fun"
[14:13:38] <Goop> ;p
[14:13:56] <BillCriswell> Goop: http://jsbin.com/quhiqixo/1/edit?html,js,output is what I thought off the top of my head.
[14:14:32] <Goop> only problem is.. I need to keep it assigned as a string blob
[14:14:45] <Goop> and during pre render
[14:15:07] <Goop> hrrm.. but maybe I can try that out... doing that post render would work
[14:15:26] <Goop> see, it's a json property.. which gets outputted to a mustache template
[14:15:27] <robertmaxrees> coderdj412 i'm going to be 100% honest and point out I don't really remember hahaha
[14:15:37] <Goop> and it has tons of mixed html content in it
[14:19:39] <BillCriswell> Goop: http://jsbin.com/quhiqixo/2/edit something like that?
[14:20:51] <BillCriswell> Goop: http://jsbin.com/quhiqixo/3/edit this actually.
[14:20:52] <Goop> not really, blob[0] is still an object
[14:21:05] <BillCriswell> Goop: Yeah, meants to use outerHTML there
[14:21:21] <Goop> yes, that
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> Goop that regex is terrifying.
[14:21:38] <Goop> now how do we benchmark that against the ugly regex? lol
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> why not convert the thing to a fragment and test the property?
[14:21:45] <Goop> robertmaxrees: lol, yes
[14:21:56] <BillCriswell> Goop: The benchmark might actually win, but it doesn't make it better by any means haha
[14:22:19] <Goop> for sure, the regex might be unreliable against certain strings
[14:22:20] <BillCriswell> Goop: The regex*
[14:22:30] <decx> doubt that the regex will be faster
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> also, regex is not intendef to be used on markup.
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> *intended
[14:22:42] <Goop> indeed.
[14:23:02] <Goop> BillCriswell, I will play with your fragmented filter instead. thx
[14:23:08] <BillCriswell> Goop: No problem!
[14:23:29] <BillCriswell> You can programatically wrap it in an container pretty easily with wrap()
[14:23:35] <BillCriswell> Have to run, later
[14:24:30] <Goop> cheers
[14:24:34] <Goop> later Bill
[14:31:09] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: one hour later I can safely say. Should have used moment.js :)
[14:31:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:32:21] <phoenixsun> I thought I was done then I realise that in order for something show 1:01. I have to created a function to convert anything below to 0 + num etc
[14:32:28] <phoenixsun> its all a huge hassle
[14:33:14] <Goop> actually, I built a callback for after the mustache template loads and just run this -> $(container).find('a').filter(function () { return this.protocol !== 'mailto:'; }).prop('target','_blank');
[14:33:33] <Goop> seems to work just fine
[14:34:42] <Goop> I just hope there is no potential lag and a user manages to click a link that has not yet had the prop added to the anchor.
[14:37:06] <EminenceHC> I want to show the closest div to my selector on change. What am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/7480cd9d9de46d4154c5
[14:37:50] <decx> closest looks upwards the tree
[14:38:11] <decx> so if you have a checkbox that shows its parent then you divide by zero per se
[14:38:49] <decx> actually downwards the tree makes more sense
[14:38:59] <decx> from one root
[14:39:09] <decx> yeah... i'm going to say downwards from now on
[14:39:46] <dmsuperman> the tree is upside down though
[14:39:49] <EminenceHC> decx: I think maybe in my code I put closest next to the thing I want changed and not the actual selector that is changing it.
[14:40:00] <EminenceHC> Downwards makes more sense to me
[14:40:03] <dmsuperman> the "top" of any DOM is always going to be HTML. or window maybe.
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> I like "parent" vs "child"
[14:40:32] <robertmaxrees> also: events bubble "up"
[14:40:33] <EminenceHC> Ya, no room for confusion there.
[14:40:43] <decx> i always said upwards to go to *root* but now that i think about it
[14:40:43] <robertmaxrees> innermost to outermost.
[14:40:48] <decx> upwards to root?
[14:40:52] <dmsuperman> yeah
[14:40:56] <dmsuperman> inverted tree
[14:41:00] <robertmaxrees> so events bubble out?
[14:41:04] <robertmaxrees> or up?
[14:41:09] <dmsuperman> otherwise everything is technically a root decx
[14:41:09] <decx> out sounds goot
[14:41:12] <decx> good
[14:41:20] <decx> the dom tree spreads out
[14:41:59] <dmsuperman> the root is the node in which all other nodes reside, right. root in more of a philosophical and less of a physical traditional tree shape
[14:42:05] <decx> is there a set convention?
[14:42:14] <EminenceHC> Why does this not work then? I assume it would look for the closest select with class .number-of-students https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/7480cd9d9de46d4154c5
[14:42:15] <dmsuperman> I've never heard anybody refer to a parent as down
[14:42:21] <dmsuperman> EminenceHC: .closest only works on parents
[14:42:37] <dmsuperman> EminenceHC: it doesn't mean closest as in physical proximity
[14:42:58] <dmsuperman> it finds the first matching parent traversing up the DOM, starting at the element itself
[14:43:01] <EminenceHC> dmsuperman: I see so the parent would be my first selector $("select.show-tick") right?
[14:44:18] <dmsuperman> EminenceHC: the parent of whatever you are calling .closest on
[14:44:54] <dmsuperman> EminenceHC: So in your code example $(this).closest('some selector' will start at the select and try to match "some selector" to it. if it doesn't match, it will go to the select's parent node.
[14:44:58] <dmsuperman> and so on
[14:50:21] <dmsuperman> jsfiddle won't let me save but here's a screenshot EminenceHC http://i.imgur.com/rWrVZG3.png
[14:50:58] <decx> closest actually starts with the element itself
[14:51:09] <dmsuperman> that's what I said ;)
[14:51:22] <dmsuperman> though I suppose I could have demonstrated that in the code as well
[14:51:26] <decx> damnit i'm like visually impaired today -.-
[14:52:16] <dmsuperman> http://i.imgur.com/Auppawu.png
[14:53:12] <s34n> It would be nice if the documentation for jquery apis included the return value for each api
[14:53:43] <dmsuperman> most all the methods are curried. the return value is the original object
[14:54:01] <s34n> dmsuperman: yes. but not always
[14:54:54] <dmsuperman> what's an example of a doc page which doesn't tell you what it returns?
[14:54:58] <s34n> calls like .append() or .after() are not obviously curried
[14:55:48] <dmsuperman> hrm? are you sure?
[14:55:56] <dmsuperman> I think .append returns the initial object
[14:56:02] <dmsuperman> or set of objects
[14:56:17] <s34n> .after() does have some indication of the return value, but only if it is called on disconnected DOM nodes
[14:57:12] <s34n> dmsuperman: .append() may be curried. Or it may not. That is my point. I wish the docs called that out for every api.
[14:57:43] <dmsuperman> I just assume that unless it specifies a return value, the return value is the jquery object
[14:58:01] <s34n> dmsuperman: I'd rather not assume.
[14:58:18] <dmsuperman> then read the source code ;)
[14:58:27] <dmsuperman> but the rest of us seem to get by just fine
[14:58:29] <dmsuperman> :P
[14:59:23] <s34n> dmsuperman: so what is the return value of .after()?
[15:00:11] <s34n> dmsuperman: you really want to spend a lot of time digesting the code to figure it out?
[15:00:37] <robertmaxrees> the jquery API DOES tell you the return type doesn't it?
[15:00:58] <s34n> robertmaxrees: not return type. I wnat to know the return value
[15:01:18] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/wSRVr22.png - "Returns: jQuery
[15:01:29] <robertmaxrees> sorry i was late to the convo - is that not what you need?
[15:01:36] <s34n> robertmaxrees: no
[15:02:01] <s34n> I need to know what the value of that object will be
[15:02:10] <s34n> is it the original object?
[15:02:26] <s34n> is it the object you appended/inserted/deleted?
[15:03:17] <s34n> in the case of .after() it seems that it can be the combination of both in some cases. What about other cases?
[15:03:18] <robertmaxrees> Prior to jQuery 1.9, .after() would attempt to add or change nodes in the current jQuery set if the first node in the set was not connected to a document, and in those cases return a new jQuery set rather than the original set. The method might or might not have returned a new result depending on the number or connectedness of its arguments! As of jQuery 1.9, .after(), .before(), and .replaceWith()
[15:03:19] <robertmaxrees> always return the original unmodified set. Attempting to use these methods on a node without a parent has no effect—that is, neither the set nor the nodes it contains are changed.
[15:03:50] <robertmaxrees> i will admit that's a little buried.
[15:04:33] <s34n> The contradicts what it says in other places
[15:04:40] <robertmaxrees> like where?
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> if you're seeing issues with the documentation, by all means submit corrections/suggestions.
[15:06:05] <s34n> The section above titled "Inserting Disconnected DOM nodes" says differently
[15:06:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where is contradicts that.
[15:07:51] <hpekdemir> I have an object like "data = {}". now I can say "data.foo = "something". but how can I make a key before I put something in.
[15:07:59] <hpekdemir> like "data.mykey.foo = something"
[15:08:06] <hpekdemir> *pseudo*
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> data.myKey = {}
[15:08:15] <hpekdemir> ah ok
[15:08:16] <hpekdemir> thank you.
[15:09:13] <dmsuperman> or null if you don't want it to be an object
[15:09:21] <s34n> robertmaxrees: look at the eaxmple in that section
[15:09:59] <s34n> $( "<div></div>" ).after( "<p></p>" ).addClass( "foo" ).filter( "p" )....
[15:10:29] <s34n> adds a class to both the <div> and the <p> and lets you filter("P")
[15:11:07] <s34n> that means that the return value of .after() was not $( "<div></div>" )
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that's an issue with how filter works.
[15:11:35] <s34n> so it does not "always return the original unmodified set"
[15:12:07] <s34n> robertmaxrees: it isn't an artifact of filter()
[15:13:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/wagizedo/1/edit
[15:13:14] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[15:13:53] <robertmaxrees> looks like the documentation might be wrong
[15:14:06] <robertmaxrees> have you considered submitting a bug?
[15:17:47] <petey> Hi guys, has anyone here ever had the issue of JQUERY adding a random number in front of your attribute?
[15:18:00] <petey> For example - setting the width of an item - $('.item').width(4%)
[15:18:04] <petey> turns out to be .width(44%)
[15:18:10] <petey> and I can't figure out for the life of me why this happens
[15:18:22] <robertmaxrees> i think you want .width('44%');
[15:18:40] <petey> err - I neglected the '' but they're there
[15:18:49] <petey> so typing .width('44%') will output '444%'
[15:18:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm. let me try to reproduce.
[15:19:07] <petey> Actually typing .width('44%') will make it '84%'
[15:19:11] <petey> so it adds a 4
[15:19:15] <petey> to the front
[15:19:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/yalocoda/1/edit
[15:19:32] <robertmaxrees> can't replicate here.
[15:19:42] <petey> I have no idea what i could be doing wrong
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code?
[15:20:49] <petey> Hold on a sec - it's an angular + jquery project
[15:20:56] <petey> It's actually inside a directive
[15:20:56] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:21:04] <petey> So angular uses jquery selectors
[15:21:07] <robertmaxrees> are you sure it's not an angular issue?
[15:21:30] <petey> I have no idea. I don't even use angular.element()
[15:21:34] <petey> I was doing it the sizzle way
[15:23:56] <EminenceHC> What am I doing wrong here.. This code should look for the selector's parent td, then look for a class using .find('.class').show(); https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/7480cd9d9de46d4154c5
[15:25:13] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> not .parent()
[15:25:24] <robertmaxrees> the latter only goes up one level.
[15:30:19] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Doh!
[15:30:22] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: thx
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> btw avoid ==
[15:30:40] <robertmaxrees> use === instead.
[15:31:38] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: ok === "value" right?
[15:31:52] <robertmaxrees> .val() === 'string'
[15:32:12] <dmsuperman> === avoids type coercion and other fun unexpected things
[15:32:17] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: That always confused me because it is an integer field but I guess JS sees it as a string field.
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> it's a string when it's returned by val.
[15:32:37] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Oh i see
[15:39:13] <robertmaxrees> if you're ever confused by the return value of a thing, you can just do typeof thing
[15:39:26] <robertmaxrees> typeof $(this).val(), for instance.
[16:01:19] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know if 'myVar = audio_context.createMediaStreamSource(stream)' has a 'context' method - myVar.context?  or is the 'context' method associated with jquery - http://api.jquery.com/context/?
[16:02:03] <robertmaxrees> only if myVar is a jquery object
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's a different context
[16:03:31] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: myVar is called 'mediaStreamSource' in my file - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/src/js/initializer.js#L74
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> then it's not a jquery object.
[16:04:01] <jeffreylevesque> thank you
[16:04:13] <robertmaxrees> it has to be passed to the jQuery function for it to be one.
[16:04:40] <jeffreylevesque> I'm having a hard time finding the definition.  But, it's nice to know it's not jquery.  I will continue on my google quest
[16:05:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't just add itself to random objects, if that makes sense.
[16:11:27] <t432> trying to submit a multipart form with the form plugin but it not seem to be working? http://pastebin.com/cks2Cg0Q
[16:11:37] <t432> plugin http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working with it?  are you getting anyu console errors?
[16:14:42] <t432> no errors
[16:14:51] <t432> just not submiting
[16:14:51] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you click submit?
[16:14:56] <t432> nothing
[16:15:30] <robertmaxrees> what is this
[16:15:37] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' object, i mean.
[16:15:44] <robertmaxrees> like, can you show us more code?
[16:16:57] <t432> you mean 'this.select('messageForm');'? thats a selector
[16:17:31] <robertmaxrees> this.uiHandleSubmitMessage = function(e){
[16:17:35] <robertmaxrees> something seems wrong here.
[16:18:27] <t432> ignore that, i;m working with a js framework
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> okay - are you sure the code is binding propertly?
[16:18:45] <robertmaxrees> *properly
[16:21:21] <t432> yes
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> have you tried to pair everything down to just the plugin and the form and nothing else?
[16:23:25] <t432> in more ignore the inputs?
[16:23:37] <sammych> robertmaxrees: *pare
[16:23:47] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah pare down
[16:23:49] <sammych> that english again ;)
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> meh
[16:24:27] <robertmaxrees> it happens.
[16:24:42] <t432> is there a way to submit multipart form with a plugin?
[16:24:49] <t432> without*
[16:24:55] <robertmaxrees> t432 dunno how mutlipart does what it does.
[16:25:20] <robertmaxrees> that particular plugin, I mean.
[16:25:55] <t432> i mean in general, can you submit a multipart from with ajax without any plugin?
[16:26:04] <t432> form*
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[16:27:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, anything you can do with a plugin you can do without a plugin technically.
[16:35:08] <systemfault> t432: With recent browsers, it's easy… it's impossible unless you use the ugly hidden iframe trick
[16:35:24] <systemfault> *With older browsers, it's impossible unless..
[16:35:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why would you need to employ iframes in his case?
[16:35:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't think he's talking about the multipart content thing.
[16:35:48] <t432> can i get a paste bin?
[16:36:11] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: He said he wants multipart.. it means that the form contains files
[16:36:20] <robertmaxrees> t432 is that the case?
[16:36:30] <t432> nvm
[16:36:32] <t432> got it
[16:36:43] <robertmaxrees> t432 could you clarify what you meant maybe?
[16:37:37] <t432> This seems to work http://pastebin.com/TSed2fT3
[16:38:00] <robertmaxrees> ah, okay so where WAS a file input.
[16:38:28] <systemfault> t432: I hope you don't need to support older browsers :)
[16:38:45] <t432> that would preferable
[16:38:47] <systemfault> (FormData is IE10 and later)
[16:38:52] <t432> would be*
[16:39:09] <t432> does the form plugin support it?
[16:39:21] <systemfault> What is the form plugin?
[16:39:41] <t432> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#ajaxForm
[16:39:50] <systemfault> I know JS, jQuery, DOM… I have no familiarity with the huge ecosystem of shitty plugins jQuery has :/
[16:40:45] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:40:47] <systemfault> t432: Looks like it supports old browsers via the hidden iframe trick
[16:41:21] <t432> then I'll opt for the plugin if can i get to work.
[16:41:39] <systemfault> t432: Just follow the instructions… you will need server-side changes.
[16:41:59] <systemfault> Because hidden iframes != xhr
[16:42:15] <wa5ted> any assist with foundation
[16:42:28] <wa5ted> im a bit confused how  ican override foundations base styles
[16:42:29] <wa5ted> with my own
[16:42:40] <wa5ted> i find myselfadding !important to all my properties
[16:42:48] <wa5ted> and im thinkign there is a better way
[16:42:59] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted put your css after the foundation css and use more specific selectors.
[16:43:04] <motaka2> hello, How can I achieve this?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/34b5382a860341656db3
[16:43:07] <wa5ted> well im using scss
[16:43:26] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: what i have done is imported settings
[16:43:31] <wa5ted> foundation
[16:43:35] <wa5ted> and then my custom css
[16:43:43] <wa5ted> thats all in my app.scss
[16:44:03] <wa5ted> the problem is that the top bar for example
[16:44:08] <wa5ted> only has a height of 45
[16:44:17] <wa5ted> if i want it to adapt to the height of the contetns
[16:44:19] <wa5ted> it doesnt
[16:44:24] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: ^
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> as long as your overrides appear after the code from foundation and the selectors are as specific or more specific, you're fine.
[16:44:32] <wa5ted> ^^
[16:44:40] <wa5ted> it seems all of the topbar css has !default
[16:44:51] <wa5ted> i remember in bootstrap this wasnt a huge issue
[16:45:00] <wa5ted> your styles would override theirs if there were any
[16:45:15] <robertmaxrees> http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/755-best-practice-for-overriding-styles-that-are-not-variables
[16:45:21] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[16:45:32] <robertmaxrees> you're kinda SOL
[16:45:45] <wa5ted> SOL?
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> shit outta luck
[16:46:22] <wa5ted> fuck -_-
[16:46:27] <wa5ted> why is this so bad
[16:46:55] <wa5ted> rather why am i not getting this
[16:47:41] <t432> got it
[16:47:43] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: do you think calling a custom.css file in the html would help
[16:48:22] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted you could give it a try.
[16:49:11] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: wait a sec i could just turn off top bar if i wanted to
[16:49:26] <robertmaxrees> this is why i don't like some frameworks.
[16:49:52] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: this is why i dont like frameworks period
[16:49:59] <wa5ted> grids fine
[16:50:08] <wa5ted> else always goes to shit if you are new
[16:50:25] <robertmaxrees> just a lot of religion
[16:50:38] <Snerf_> with $.fn.SomeFunctionName, can I have a  variable for SomeFunctionName .. ie: var fnname = "SomeFunctionName" and then pass that to $.fn. ..?
[16:51:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:52:22] <Snerf_> trying to create a dynamic function name, thats all
[16:52:52] <systemfault> Snerf_: $.fn[fnname] = ...
[16:52:52] <v0lksman> is there a way to detect a redirect response when using $.post() ?
[16:53:49] <Snerf_> systemfault, thanks.. will give that a shot
[16:54:16] <systemfault> v0lksman: Not AFAIK, the redirects are just automagically followed
[16:54:35] <systemfault> It's not jQuery's fault… it's how XHR works
[16:54:48] <v0lksman> yeah was hoping to detect it and if it exists then do something different than if it didn't
[16:55:17] <robertmaxrees> Snerf_ btw avoid dynaimcally creating functions like that.
[16:57:13] <Snerf_> systemfault, thanks, worked like a charm
[17:30:41] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[17:34:35] <terryleigh> Hi guys, is there an efficient way of removing linebreaks in certain html elements, like LI's in UL's..
[17:34:50] <robertmaxrees> .replace() on the .text()
[17:35:02] <terryleigh> This is to remove spaces that occur with inline-block without resorting to CSS / HTML hacks.
[17:35:18] <terryleigh> robertmaxrees: are there any downsides to doing that?
[17:35:43] <robertmaxrees> you want to modify the text of something.  it's one of your only options.
[17:37:20] <terryleigh> robertmaxrees: I know, but will there be performance issues?
[17:37:36] <robertmaxrees> terryleigh not really.
[17:39:00] <robertmaxrees> ideally you'd do that work in your backend anyway
[17:52:41] <davesleep> zup, anyone here used tinyMCE?
[17:52:49] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ davesleep
[17:52:49] <b-ot> davesleep: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:53:07] <terryleigh> robertmaxrees: any idea why this: $('body').html($('body').html().replace(/[\n]/g,'x')); would place 6 spaces after the x ?
[17:53:13] <davesleep> anyone here used tinyMCE and know where i can find the documentation on the creation of dialog boxes for custom plugins
[17:53:28] <davesleep> like all the options that are there like body bodytype etc.
[17:53:38] <robertmaxrees> terryleigh i'd need to see it in use, but that seems really... strange
[17:54:05] <terryleigh> robertmaxrees: would that be the way to do that though?
[17:54:10] <robertmaxrees> terryleigh do what?
[17:54:16] <terryleigh> remove the white sapces
[17:54:16] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were replacing text.
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> use .text()
[17:54:26] <terryleigh> I mean remove the new lines...
[17:54:41] <robertmaxrees> don't convert everything to html and then wholesale do it there.
[17:55:35] <robertmaxrees> find the elements you need to strip the newlines from and run it explicitly against those.
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> also, you'll need to check for all three newline styles.
[17:57:23] <terryleigh> I'll make it more specific when I get it right.
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> erm, do it against a specific element.
[17:58:28] <robertmaxrees> don't target all the documents HTML to do it.
[17:58:43] <robertmaxrees> work against an indicative example to make sure you're getting the results you expect.
[18:02:43] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: still lost
[18:02:46] <wa5ted> with this foundation stuff
[18:03:40] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted i hear that.
[18:04:07] <wa5ted> i am missing somethign
[18:04:09] <wa5ted> major
[18:06:18] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the concept of selector specificity?
[18:07:11] <jphase> wa5ted, you still having troubles with scss?
[18:07:31] <wa5ted> jphase: yes :( , its still confusing for me,
[18:07:34] <wa5ted> her eis what i get so far
[18:07:39] <wa5ted> bower_components
[18:07:40] <wa5ted> you dont touch
[18:07:41] <jphase> you gots to include them from app.scss as their name, the _beforethefile.scss is ignored in the include
[18:07:48] <wa5ted> and you create a custom file and import in
[18:07:50] <jphase> yes, you can but... then you break bower hehe
[18:07:51] <wa5ted> app.scss
[18:08:10] <wa5ted> yeah
[18:08:13] <wa5ted> _refers to a partial
[18:08:27] <jphase> yeah so like... in app.scss you can do like... @import "site/structure";
[18:08:34] <jphase> that will import site/_structure.scss
[18:08:40] <jphase> there you can override scss vars
[18:08:56] <wa5ted> cant i just do
[18:09:02] <wa5ted> import "custom";
[18:09:15] <wa5ted> have a custom.scss in the same place as app.scss
[18:09:25] <jphase> k that works too
[18:09:37] <wa5ted> btw there is a bug in their imports for app.scss
[18:09:47] <wa5ted> bug aside
[18:09:52] <wa5ted> i cant seem to figur eout
[18:09:57] <wa5ted> why my styles wont overwrite
[18:10:05] <wa5ted> i dont want to slap !important evefywhwer
[18:10:08] <wa5ted> everywhere
[18:10:22] <jphase> hmm, you shouldn't have to do that
[18:11:00] <jphase> like you could do:   .top-bar-container, .tab-bar { margin-bottom: rem-calc(32); } and it should override just fine
[18:11:48] <wa5ted> well yes
[18:11:57] <wa5ted> if i use their exact structure and shit it should
[18:12:01] <wa5ted> but i shouldnt have to
[18:12:02] <wa5ted> yanno
[18:12:07] <wa5ted> maybe im doing soemthig wrong
[18:12:15] <wa5ted> but like font changes and stuff
[18:12:17] <jphase> hmm, well remember, it's still css - just pre-compiled
[18:12:20] <wa5ted> there are barely any classes
[18:12:25] <wa5ted> i know i know
[18:15:15] <wa5ted> jphase: example: if i want to increase the paddign around an element in the top-bar i cant since the height of the top bar is fixed
[18:16:12] <jphase> yeah, so change the height of the top bar from 45px or whatever to auto
[18:16:55] <bcn> hello, I am trying to understand what the return type of $.post . If I try to compare the returned data with === it never works but it does with ==
[18:17:00] <wa5ted> jphase: it doesnt override
[18:17:17] <wa5ted> bcn: do oyu understand the differnce between the two
[18:17:23] <bcn> I think so
[18:17:24] <wa5ted> === vs -==
[18:17:31] <bcn> one compares type and value
[18:17:36] <wa5ted> kk
[18:17:37] <bcn> the other just value?
[18:17:41] <wa5ted> yes
[18:18:04] <bcn> if i do (data == 200) it works. if I do (data === 200) or if (data === "200") it doesnt.
[18:18:05] <wa5ted> so have you checked the two things that you are comparing are returnign the right type *and* value
[18:18:21] <wa5ted> hcekc type of data
[18:18:25] <wa5ted> check*
[18:18:27] <bcn> how do I check that?
[18:18:33] <jphase> typeof data
[18:18:39] <bcn> ok ill check
[18:18:53] <wa5ted> bcn: this might help http://javascript.info/tutorial/type-detection
[18:19:36] <bcn> alert(typeof data) says string
[18:19:36] <wa5ted> jphase: so yeah its really weird i might need you to run me through foundation 5 shit
[18:19:39] <wa5ted> if you have the time
[18:20:00] <bcn> and if I do alert(data) it says 200
[18:20:14] <bcn> so if I do  if (data === "200") it should work? but it doesnt
[18:20:28] <wa5ted> bcn: why do you need to chekc type
[18:20:45] <bcn> jslint errors
[18:20:50] <jphase> wa5ted, so you're saying:    $topbar-height: auto;    <-- that doesn't work in your scss file?
[18:20:51] <wa5ted> what?
[18:21:02] <wa5ted> jphase: wait what
[18:21:19] <jphase> uh yeah, the var you have to override and such that's in their docs
[18:21:24] <jphase> you have tried this and failed or?
[18:21:39] <wa5ted> _topbar.scss
[18:21:40] <wa5ted> right
[18:21:52] <wa5ted> i thought its bad idea to touch that stuff
[18:22:03] <jphase> who said anything about touching that stuff?
[18:22:08] <wa5ted> oh joy
[18:22:10] <wa5ted> -_-
[18:22:14] <wa5ted> settings.scss
[18:22:15] <wa5ted> fuck
[18:22:18] <jphase> ;]
[18:22:29] <wa5ted> jphase: i hate you :)
[18:22:33] <jphase> <3
[18:23:25] <wa5ted> jphase: that didnt work either
[18:23:46] <wa5ted>  $topbar-height: auto;
[18:23:48] <wa5ted> right
[18:24:49] <wa5ted> jphase: da fuck
[18:24:54] <wa5ted> weird shit man
[18:25:15] <jphase> where are you editing what?
[18:25:16] <bcn> just realized if I do if (data == "200") it doesn't work. the only thing that works is if (data == 200). anything else fails. is this normal?
[18:25:19] <jphase> it's too cryptic for me
[18:25:27] <wa5ted> lol i got it
[18:25:30] <wa5ted> its being weird
[18:25:35] <jphase> bcn, yes
[18:25:35] <systemfault> bcn: What is the type of data?
[18:25:45] <wa5ted> jphase: question 2 any classes for vertical centering of content
[18:25:51] <bcn> typeof data says string
[18:26:09] <systemfault> bcn: So… you can do if (data === "200") just fine.
[18:26:16] <bcn> if (data == "200") fails but if (data == 200) succceeds
[18:26:24] <bcn> no === doesnt work at all
[18:26:24] <systemfault> o_O
[18:26:26] <jphase> wa5ted, I don't know of anything that vertically centers, no
[18:26:53] <systemfault> bcn: Does data has any extra characters?
[18:27:22] <bcn> it doesn't look to. It returns from php and it says echo "200"; I checked for extra spaces
[18:27:48] <bcn> oooooohhh
[18:27:51] <bcn> one sec
[18:28:41] <bcn> a new line after closing ?> was causing it
[18:28:49] <bcn> now it works
[18:29:20] <bcn> just removed the closing ?> too. found out its not neccesary if the file is only php and prevents such thigns as this
[18:29:33] <jphase> bcn, and THAT is why you aren't supposed to close php ;]
[18:29:56] <jphase> well, that and one other thing, both somewhat rare to run into
[18:30:08] <bcn> haha ya!
[18:30:15] <bcn> whats the other?
[18:30:31] <jphase> scripts that execute before a header() redirect is called
[18:30:40] <jphase> says headers have already been sent, redirect = fail;
[18:30:41] <jphase> hehe
[18:31:10] <bcn> haha I think I had that before at some point
[18:31:18] <systemfault> bcn: Glad you fixed it :)
[18:31:24] <bcn> thanks for everyones help
[18:31:51] <wa5ted> jphase: im getign the hang of this
[18:32:07] <jphase> yeah, it takes a second but you'll enjoy it after not too long
[18:34:01] <wa5ted> jphase: just using icon fonts is my next thing
[18:34:32] <jphase> hm, not really sure what that's got to do with scss/foundation though
[18:34:50] <wa5ted> it doesnt just trying to figure out agood place to put them
[18:34:57] <jphase> oh sure
[18:35:17] <jphase> any ol' place before your stylesheet is loaded in case you need to override
[18:36:03] <wa5ted> true true
[18:36:18] <wa5ted> pressuming i should use a cdn
[18:37:27] <tejas-manohar> anyone here worked with mongoose node before?
[18:37:30] <jphase> their cdn is fine if you want to include from there
[18:37:39] <jphase> yes tejas-manohar
[18:37:53] <tejas-manohar> jphase: have some questions, are you in the node.js chatroom
[18:38:01] <tejas-manohar> or would you join? or is it alright to ask here?
[18:38:26] <jphase> meh, not at the moment, I'm trying to get away from the things that are off-topic to my current client although wa5ted always seems to drop bombs
[18:38:38] <jphase> tejas-manohar, is there no response in node.js chan?
[18:38:52] <tejas-manohar> jphase: nope :(
[18:39:04] <wa5ted> jphase: what do you mean drop bombs? XD
[18:39:37] <tejas-manohar> jphase: trying to learn node with mongoose for a quick project, my questions are really basic but im just still in high school trying to crank out a project lol
[18:39:40] <jphase> bah, let me get my ssh keys and git repos setup so I can work locally on this machine for my client before I help - I also need a cigarette. I barely got home from work and now I have a bunch of work outside of work to do :`[
[18:40:12] <tejas-manohar> alright thats understandable let me know if you’re ready to help, itll be very very appreciasted :)
[18:40:15] <jphase> give me just a few seconds
[18:40:20] <jphase> s/seconds/minutes
[18:40:25] <tejas-manohar> haha yeah
[18:46:51] <diggitydane> I'm trying to get a div overlay on mouseover, but I can't get the flicker to stop when going over a link
[18:46:56] <diggitydane> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3fee50a87a4250a13161
[18:47:15] <diggitydane> any ideas on how to not flicker when going over "preview" or "choose"
[18:53:58] <str> hi eveyrone!
[18:57:02] <sammych> how expensive is $('body') and is it worth caching it?
[18:57:19] <sammych> I could just use document.body...
[18:57:30] <sammych> thanks for the advice, sammych
[18:57:38] <tejas-manohar> jphase: you back? trying to store multidem array with mongoose when setting like so var Subscriber = mongoose.model('Subscriber', new mongoose.Schema({
[18:58:22] <str> I have a form that on submit needs to do an ajax call using GoogleAnalytics API, I need to send the API the callback to continue the form post();  How could I do that?
[18:59:39] <str> I have $('form').submit(function(){  ga('send', 'action', {'hitCallback': *setHereTheCallBackToContinueTheFormPost*  })   })
[18:59:44] <str> and I have no idea how to do that
[19:01:28] <jphase> tejas-manohar, hm, you used Mixed type?
[19:02:08] <tejas-manohar> jphase: no not sure what thjat is
[19:03:00] <jphase> well you're supposed to be able to push arrays onto an Array type
[19:03:10] <jphase> some ppl say it flattens it but I'm pretty sure that works
[19:03:58] <jphase> here, try something like what this guy is doing:  https://gist.github.com/aheckmann/1104335
[19:05:13] <tw2113> is jphase causing trouble again?
[19:05:20] <jphase> :x
[19:05:43] <tw2113> no one is saying yes?i think you're covered
[19:07:49] <sammych> an array is an object?
[19:07:58] <sammych> don't see why you can't push anything into any object
[19:08:09] <sammych> unless you mean push()
[19:08:27] <sammych> or concat()
[19:08:48] <tejas-manohar> jphase: still there?
[19:09:00] <jphase> mhm
[19:09:22] <systemfault> sammych: Because all arrays are objects but not all objects are arrays?
[19:09:34] <tw2113> #jslogic
[19:10:08] <systemfault> sammych: If you prefer, all the array stuff is on Array.prototype and not Object.prototype
[19:10:47] <sammych> my bad, when I say 'push', I mean 'add'
[19:10:54] <sammych> not 'push()'
[19:12:21] <systemfault> sammych: What's wrong with obj[newKey] = newValue;? (Unless I don't understand your idea)
[19:20:07] <tejas-manohar> jphase: im trying to get the effect of a multidimensional array by defining my own schematype using the mixed type
[19:20:13] <tejas-manohar> not sure really how :(
[19:21:31] <jphase> yeah, that looks like what that guy is doing in the link I gave you
[19:31:50] <sammych> for a MVC-type application, if data changes and I want views to react to it, triggering a custom event name to body would be cleanest way to manage that?
[19:32:29] <sammych> atm, I have a mess of delegates on the view elements themselves
[20:27:57] <snufft> hi guys!
[20:28:16] <snufft> is there a way to write a switch statement with .hasClass()?
[20:28:34] <snufft> or something like hasClass()
[20:29:37] <snufft> it's searching for a class on the body element, if that helps :)
[20:31:34] <sammych> maybe you're better off adding that class into data-blah= instead, then switch on that.
[20:34:55] <snufft> sammych, in that case, I might be better off sticking with statements like if($('body').hasClass('class-name-here')){ Thanks anyway :)
[20:45:10] <sammych> snufft: if you're using switch (and not using fall through) you only have one match anyway
[20:50:23] <snufft> sammych, i just saw something about that on stack exchange. i'd have to separate the classes out into something else and iterate over it, which switch wouldn't do. I guess the hasClass() method is the cleanest :)
[21:25:59] <SuperPhly> Is there a way to automate the creation of HAR files in Chrome? Say I have 100 URLs I want to scan.
[22:10:38] <samuel> anyone know how to .get a txt file with php code in it and display it in a textarea without it rendering?
[22:19:08] <kevireilly> samuel: change the filename to something other than .php and the server likely won’t try to run the code, returning the text itself. And then yeah it is easy to insert the text into a textarea, i think it is just $(‘#textarea’).val(phpText);
[22:19:38] <samuel> i have it already a txt file kevireilly
[22:20:37] <kevireilly> samuel: okie, should work.. is there a certain issue? I didn’t really know what you meant by “without it rendering"
[22:21:11] <samuel> well I have an echo 'hello'; and it's just showing hello without hte php tags and echo
[22:21:24] <samuel> do I have to run it through a php function and return it that way?
[22:37:54] <zzaichik> so, which lightbox popup do you guys like most?
[22:37:59] <zzaichik> lightbox? colorbox?
[22:38:15] <kevireilly> samuel: confirmed that you are getting them back in your response?
[22:56:03] <raul782> hi guys, how can you select <a rel="/100/">text</a>?
[22:57:02] <raul782> this doesn't work for me $("a[rel='\/100\/']"), something is wrong
[23:11:21] <denb> hey there
[23:13:03] <denb> any tips on assigning color based on json value? (i.e. i have a range 1-100%, yellow-red, i need to assing color from my json value (for example: 15) based on that range)
[23:13:09] <denb> assign*
[23:19:32] <Mindblighter> hi guys. can anyone recommend a surefire way of turning hover dropdown menus to touch versions for mobile devices? i had a fairly simple script for it using the standard click event and it worked fine on all my previous test devices but it no longer does the trick on my new ones. i've gone through several samples on the web and so far none of them have worked well enough
[23:34:16] <denb> anyone?
[23:46:17] <denb> :(
