[00:03:19] <colonel_panic> hey thanks for the help
[00:03:56] <colonel_panic> I very much appreciate it
[00:05:20] <momomo> is there a way to select the first mathc for a query ?
[00:05:35] <momomo> something.find('.someclass')
[00:15:42] <Cork> momomo: .first() ?
[00:17:40] <andrew9184> .get(0) ?
[00:18:00] <Cork> .get will return the dom element not a jquery object
[00:18:14] <Cork> .eq(0) is an option
[00:21:20] <Uhkis> wouldn't :first-child work also?
[00:24:50] <momomo> Cork, the problem is that I suspect jquery will still find all matches first, which is not optimal ... i am interested in the first match. first() is applied after all have been found.
[00:24:53] <arup_r_> Why the color is not getting changed http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOLyjp ?
[00:25:22] <Cork> momomo: dom will find what the css selector matches
[00:25:29] <Cork> momomo: not much jquery can do about that
[00:25:48] <Cork> you could try first-child if it is a first child
[00:26:47] <Cork> arup_r_: the event selector and the selector you use won't ever work
[00:26:57] <Cork> arup_r_: you first ask for events from all child spans
[00:27:08] <Cork> and then you search for the span inside the span...
[00:27:27] <Cork> (remove .find("span") and you most likely get what you are looking for)
[00:27:31] <arup_r_> Cork: thanks fixed it
[00:46:25] <anli> Is there a way to hide a table column using the developer tools?
[00:46:33] <anli> (using chrome)
[00:46:52] <Cork> anli: run a jquery selector and .hide()
[00:46:57] <anli> hehe
[00:47:20] <Cork> or you could edit the css for each element if you prefer that
[00:47:27] <anli> Yeah, thats possible of course, $("th:nth-child(3),td:nth-child(3)").remove();
[00:47:36] <anli> But I only want to preview
[00:48:00] <anli> Like I can change font sizes, padding etc to see how it would look
[00:48:24] <Cork> you can add a display: none; to each column
[00:48:28] <Cork> or rather each td
[00:49:10] <anli> Yes, but thats not smooth enough :)
[00:51:51] <Cork> lol

[01:26:50] <Kartagis> I'm trying to develop a phonegap app and I've got this plugin org.apache.cordova.dialogs.

[01:39:48] <axscode_> hi Guys, i want to ask how can i detect change of month in jquery ui datepicker? this is when an arrow left or right is clicked.
[01:40:48] <dimi1947> are you aware of any plugin that produces toast messages from that slide in the user's screen from the top of the viewport?
[01:43:19] <axscode_> datepicker onChangeMonthYear comes in handy thanks
[01:54:40] <PrimalHunter> Hi, I'm running into an issue with CORS. Maybe someone has a hint? I'm using a $.ajax request to access a WebAPI that is hosted on IIS with a a different port and NTLM authentification. I'm not able to change the API to handle a the OPTIONS header for a pre-flight which is neccessary as the content-type has to be application/JSON. Any idea what I could do to solve this?
[02:36:11] <sshine> is there an n-ary concat method that can turn [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] into [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]?
[02:38:28] <sshine> ah well, I'll just concat each element individually, since the end-result is a string anyways.
[02:41:05] <Cork> sshine: Array.prototype.concat.apply([], [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
[02:42:14] <Cork> or if you just want a string
[02:42:18] <Cork> just use .join()
[02:42:25] <sshine> right. that's what I ended up doing.
[02:42:27] <Cork> js> print([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]].join())
[02:42:30] <b-ot> Cork: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
[02:42:54] <sshine> what does ...apply([], [[1,2,3],...]) mean
[02:43:03] <Cork> ?mdn function.apply
[02:43:04] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.apply() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[02:43:09] <sshine> I mean, why is this different from [[1,2,3],...].concat()?
[02:43:23] <Cork> it converts the array into arguments
[02:43:29] <sshine> ahhh.
[02:43:37] <sshine> and concat supports a variable amount of arguments. gotcha.
[02:46:39] <Francis47> can someone help me find and copy the (16) part of this string: "Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq (16)" ?
[02:49:34] <Cork> js> print("Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq (16)".match(/\(([0-9]+)\)/)[1])
[02:49:39] <b-ot> Cork: 16
[02:50:01] <Cork> or if you want to keep the ()
[02:50:09] <Cork> js> print("Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq (16)".match(/(\([0-9]+\))/)[1])
[02:50:13] <b-ot> Cork: (16)
[02:50:31] <sshine> Francis47, do you live in Greenland?
[02:56:31] <Francis47> Cork
[02:57:02] <Francis47> no - but work a lot on Greenlandic projects
[02:57:54] <Francis47> what do i do if the string is dynamic and resides indside this: .location_left .pane-facets-country-frontpage ul li a
[02:58:12] <Cork> Francis47: just grab the .text() of the element
[03:00:17] <Francis47> right :)
[03:01:00] <Francis47> ah and if it (correctly matches multiple results?
[03:02:57] <Cork> Francis47: you would have to loop the elements
[03:17:28] <sshine> http://jsfiddle.net/Qjvb3/ - I'm trying to make this example work, but where I activate the clicking from javascript. (I'm trying to activate a file download where the filename is known. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717851/save-file-javascript-with-file-name suggests a bunch of stuff that doesn't work and this thing that only seems to work when I actively click the link myself)
[03:18:09] <sshine> I've tried to simply .click() it, but that doesn't seem to do anything.
[03:18:22] <sshine> (both the jQuery object and the DOM element directly.)
[03:18:55] <sshine> ah... clicking only sets those properties. the actual downloading happens by following the link naturally.
[03:20:32] <sshine> so the lack of support for "fake clicking" is a security feature, it seems (http://stackoverflow.com/a/1694803/235908 )
[03:21:35] <sshine> if I do the following, the filename isn't set properly: window.location.href = 'data:text/csv;charset=utf-8;filename=data.csv,' + encodeURIComponent(csv)
[03:28:05] <AbuDhar> easiest way to make a modal popup+
[03:28:07] <AbuDhar> ?
[03:28:44] <AbuDhar> bPopup.js ?
[03:34:22] <hak> Hello does $(document).ready() wait also for scripts to load?
[03:39:26] <Cork> hak: ready waits for the document to be completely parsed
[03:40:00] <slax0r> pretty easy to test, add a simple script to your footer with just some alert, and add a .ready() script in the head with a different alert, check which alert fires first
[03:40:00] <Cork> so if the script is loaded through <script> tags in the original html, then yes
[03:40:18] <Cork> if you load it through ajax, then no it won't wait for it
[03:40:44] <hak> ok, I am having issue where sometimes site loads for 10seconds and I have some jQuery code which should be executed as soon as it can manipulate the dom
[03:41:10] <Cork> hak: what is causing the load time?
[03:42:25] <hak> I am not sure, I can check. The thing is it is not my site. Sadly I have only access to add JS and do changes to the site with it (temporarily).
[03:46:37] <Cork> hak: open the performance/network tab in the browser
[03:46:46] <Cork> then just check where the time is consumed
[03:59:58] <AbuDhar> Cork: how should I make a popup dialog?
[04:15:59] <ngr> I'm looking for a way to wait for my ajax request to complete before my function returns. However the function issues more than one ajax request so I don't want 'async: true' but something like xhr.await()
[04:18:56] <taplar> You could return the deferred of both the requests from the function and other methods that call it that need to wait until they are done to do some logic could then attach that logic to the deferred in a done callback
[04:21:57] <ngr> thanks taplar. unfortunately the calls happen within the actions layer of my Flux architecture and I cannot return a value there (yes, I *could* but that would'nt make sense in my context).
[04:22:50] <ngr> Actually I don't need a return value at all. My function should dispatch an event when both requests completed.
[04:23:41] <ngr> I guess I could nest the second request withing the first and dispatch the event when the second request completes, but that feels like I'm not using the full async power of ajax
[04:24:43] <taplar> $.when(defer1, defer2).done(function(){ /* blah happens when both are finished */});
[04:25:19] <ngr> great! exactly what I was looking for. thanks a lot

[05:25:21] <glaucom> can anyone help me in a matter POST on the same page using jquery?
[05:37:10] <SirLagz> glaucom: are you posting to the page that's running the post?
[05:43:10] <glaucom> SirLagz: see
[05:43:26] <glaucom> http://imgur.com/a/cKs30
[05:43:37] <glaucom> SirLagz: i no retrive data on $x1
[05:45:47] <SirLagz> glaucom: I wouldn't be using PHP and HTML on the same page that way in the first place
[05:47:06] <glaucom> SirLagz: k.
[05:47:09] <glaucom> on moment
[05:47:13] <SirLagz> glaucom: kk
[05:47:50] <glaucom> SirLagz: the problem is that the post apparently works, plus the page is still the old one.
[05:49:41] <SirLagz> glaucom: well that's because the post that you're doing is an AJAX post...do you get the 'complete' console message?
[05:50:31] <clay> hi
[05:50:38] <SirLagz> hi
[05:50:49] <glaucom> SirLagz: in order
[05:50:59] <glaucom> SirLagz: http://imgur.com/a/rfd9P
[05:51:08] <clay> can I ask a question
[05:52:02] <glaucom> SirLagz: I am noob. more like doing normal post on another page. But still keeps the old page showing on the screen.
[05:53:40] <clay> anyone know anything about jquery ui spinner
[05:53:43] <SirLagz> clay: sure
[05:53:52] <SirLagz> clay: i've used the jQuery UI Spinner before...
[05:54:25] <clay> that is good. I am having a lot of trouble getting the example to work.
[05:55:02] <SirLagz> glaucom: are you actually making something or just learning how to build an ajax page?
[05:55:07] <clay> I am trying to use it with currency
[05:55:58] <clay> I am making something ... I need the user to set a price from a list, and I thought a spinner would be good
[05:56:39] <clay> I am not really having any problem with anything else.
[05:56:47] <Francis47> Can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/902Lsoj2/1/ - I need to remove everything else than the parentheses and its content.
[05:57:19] <SirLagz> clay: can you post up a fiddle or show us the page?
[05:57:33] <clay> the spinnner disappears when I use  numberFormat: "C"
[05:59:20] <SirLagz> clay: example?
[05:59:24] <SirLagz> clay: code? something?
[05:59:47] <glaucom> SirLagz: no
[05:59:53] <Cork> Francis47: http://jsfiddle.net/902Lsoj2/2/
[06:01:14] <clay> This is the offending code: $( "#spinner" ).spinner({ culture: "en-US", min: 5, max: 2500, step: 25, start: 1000,  numberFormat: "C" });
[06:01:16] <Francis47> Cork: Thank you :) - Is there a way of replacing it directly?
[06:01:29] <Cork> Francis47: use .each like i told you before
[06:01:35] <Cork> (instead of .map)
[06:01:56] <clay> the spinner works ok until I add the last line  numberFormat: "C"
[06:03:06] <Francis47> Cork: I am a dork - i have no idea how to do it.
[06:03:13] <clay> then in web console I get: TypeError: Globalize.parseFloat is not a function
[06:03:16] <Cork> ?api each @ Francis47

[06:09:46] <glaucom> SirLagz: You can not make an example to me?
[06:12:26] <SirLagz> glaucom: Sorry, I got sidetracked
[06:13:04] <SirLagz> glaucom: Ideally, you should have one HTML page that has the form, and a PHP page that just returns data when you post to it.
[06:13:07] <hellyeah> why i canot sort all rows https://jsfiddle.net/v7a3cr2p/14/
[06:13:49] <hellyeah> just url "header" i can sort it
[06:23:02] <abk_> any way to write this in 1 line ? if(b = 22.toString().split('') != null && b.length == 2 && b[0] == b[1])1
[06:25:32] <Cork> abk_: you're using a static value (22) what is the point of the if case?
[06:25:55] <Cork> also it is already a one liner...
[06:27:14] <abk_> oh i pulled it out of a loop :p
[06:27:24] <abk_> it doesnt work though, it complains its invalid :/
[06:28:02] <Cork> jsfiddle the loop
[06:28:05] <hellyeah> hey why this sort thing didnt work in all rows i just can sort when i click url https://jsfiddle.net/v7a3cr2p/14/
[06:28:10] <abk_> oh its invalid cuz (22).toString() works the other way doesnt, nvm
[06:28:30] <Cork> abk_: the if case will always be true, why have it?
[06:28:55] <Cork> "22" will always be two characters and the first and second character will always be the same
[06:29:06] <abk_> its just a placeholder for a var
[06:29:11] <Cork> ...
[06:29:20] <hellyeah> 22 is placeholder?
[06:29:31] <Cork> no it is a broken psudo example
[06:29:31] <hellyeah> 22 is static?
[06:29:53] <abk_> ... ? just paste the code it doesnt work
[06:30:04] <Cork> abk_: abreverting the code is ok, but at least make it so it actually works as a question
[06:30:26] <abk_> Cork: if it worked i wouldnt have to ask u
[06:30:36] <abk_> nvm :x
[06:30:55] <Cork> abk_: if you replacing a variable with a static number is impossible to answer what the real problem is

[07:46:53] <glaucom> SirLagz: if possible, download and try http://devoops.me/themes/devoops/devoops.zip
[07:49:42] <mentoc> How to exit from javascript?
[07:50:08] <jrockjiggz> You can just use return.
[07:50:08] <mentoc> throw ''; ?????
[07:50:33] <jrockjiggz> return false;
[07:50:33] <jrockjiggz> return true;
[07:50:33] <jrockjiggz> return "some string";

[07:53:29] <Wafamde> Hi. I am making a script for rating using 5 stars. I'm not sure whan I am doing wrong here. It looks like this:  https://gyazo.com/e91d9472457fd6f7e3aa1cac206e61ed - Code:  http://pastebin.com/fqm5vAVn
[07:53:42] <Wafamde> I can set the stars for one element, but after that has been set, I cant do it anymore.
[07:54:04] <hellyeah> man why this doesnt work
[07:54:04] <hellyeah> !
[07:54:24] <Wafamde> Sorry if my description of the problem isnt the best. Let me know if I need to elaborate.
[07:56:19] <Wafamde> Im thinking that $(this).parent() is unique, but it may not be? When I save the first element in the stars array, it seems like it saves all of them, so I cant hover or click on any of the others.
[08:01:13] <taplar> what is the purpose of the stars array?
[08:02:03] <Wafamde> To check if that set of stars has already been set, so hovering over it again wont cause any changes after its been clicked.
[08:03:51] <jrockjiggz> what the heck, console.log(programsArray); i see array in console.. but in console, typing programsArray i get 'undefined'
[08:04:50] <Wafamde> jrockjiggz - If you have it in (function() {})(); then I dont think you can access it from the console.
[08:05:04] <jrockjiggz> just in $(function (){ });
[08:05:20] <Wafamde> Think thats the same. Try moving it outside of that.
[08:05:25] <Wafamde> Then you can probably access it from the console.
[08:06:10] <jrockjiggz> you seem to be right
[08:07:08] <Wafamde> Vars dont exist outside of funcs. Its just a way to make sure you dont pollute other scripts.
[08:07:38] <mentoc> Is there a way to check if an image is valid in jquery?
[08:07:52] <taplar> Wafamde: instead of using an array for that, which i'm thinking is part of your issue, try setting and checking a prop instead
[08:07:59] <mentoc> <img src='/img/foo.png'> // check if that image exists or not
[08:08:21] <Wafamde> taplar, not sure Im following you? A prop on the parent?
[08:08:22] <mentoc> Maybe an ajax call and if it 404's then it doesn't exist?
[08:09:16] <Wafamde> mentoc, cant you use a load event to see if it loads it?
[08:09:17] <taplar> $(this).prop('starsSet', true);
[08:09:29] <mentoc> Wafamde: I didn't know you could do that
[08:09:30] <taplar> if (!$(this).prop('starsSet')) {}
[08:09:33] <Wafamde> taplar, I'll give that a try. Thanks.
[08:09:45] <Wafamde> mentoc, https://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[08:10:37] <mentoc> Wafamde: but what if it never loads?
[08:10:48] <Wafamde> Then its not valid I guess
[08:11:57] <jrockjiggz> can anyone help me see why i'm getting undefined here? https://dpaste.de/q8HJ
[08:12:26] <Wafamde> taplar, that did the trick. Than you.
[08:12:48] <Wafamde> Thank*
[08:13:14] <jrockjiggz> oh, nm.. it is working just error on last index..
[08:13:15] <jrockjiggz> sorry
[08:16:27] <Wafamde> taplar_, your solution worked. Thank you. Not sure if you got my last message. Seems like you timed out.
[08:17:27] <taplar_> cool, yeah, my network hates irc i think, lol
[08:27:52] <Wafamde> taplar_, any idea why it didnt work with the array? Not that it matters, Im just curious now.
[08:29:38] <taplar_> i think since you were trying to look it up with a jquery object, it was matching when it should not have
[08:30:18] <taplar_> prop makes more sense though, :)
[08:31:19] <Wafamde> Alright
[08:31:20] <taplar_> still got your link?  mind throwing it up again?
[08:31:27] <taplar_> i had another though
[08:31:27] <Wafamde> http://pastebin.com/fqm5vAVn
[08:31:42] <taplar_> yeah
[08:32:02] <taplar_> another idea that you could do, when they set it, you could unbind the other two actions from the element so they wouldn't happen for it in the first place
[08:32:29] <Wafamde> Hmm true, that might be a better option actually.
[08:32:37] <taplar_> would remove the need for the ifs
[08:32:48] <Wafamde> Gonna give that a try
[08:41:10] <Wafamde> taplar_, is this what you were thinking? http://pastebin.com/PTV8CGQg
[08:41:34] <Wafamde> Think I have to rethink it a bit tho. Seems like a lot to have the events on each start instead of just on each parent.
[08:41:43] <Wafamde> star*
[08:42:18] <taplar_> eh, close, let me see...
[08:42:22] <Wafamde> Line 23-25 are there in order to make the user able to change his vote.
[08:49:43] <taplar_> sorry, this may take a bit, office is making me busy, :s
[08:49:52] <Wafamde> Moved the unbinds into the first loop so it removes it on all the stars.
[08:50:03] <Wafamde> Sure, take your time. PM me if I dont respond. I'm bad at checking irc.
[08:50:14] <taplar_> couple things.  cache your $(this) in variables instead of doing it over and over. and try to use on() and off()
[08:50:31] <duch_kazatel> ew off
[08:50:37] <duch_kazatel> delegate listeners, bind once.
[08:50:37] <Wafamde> on() and off() hmm.. Never used that. Gonna read about it. Thanks.
[08:50:39] <duch_kazatel> call it a day.
[08:51:48] <taplar_> true, you could use a delegate listener to do this as well, making the selector invalid after the click happened
[08:52:05] <duch_kazatel> or check some other criteria.  all sorts of choices.
[08:52:23] <Wafamde> A delegate listener?
[08:52:28] <duch_kazatel> delegated.
[08:52:34] <Wafamde> Could you explain or show me an example of this? Thats all new to me.
[08:52:39] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child
[08:52:44] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});l
[08:53:12] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:53:17] <duch_kazatel> good reading material on the subject.
[08:53:27] <Wafamde> I'll have a look
[08:53:59] <duch_kazatel> make sure you actually read all of that - 95% of the time people jump to the first example on that first link and mess it up because that's not the delegated listener :)
[08:54:40] <Wafamde> Been there, done that. I usually read it all now ;)
[09:02:59] <MarkyC> What is the performance impact of using $(document) vs caching it: var $document = $(document) ?
[09:03:08] <duch_kazatel> depends.
[09:03:21] <duch_kazatel> $() calls a (pretty heavy) constructor and returns a new object.
[09:03:49] <duch_kazatel> if you're using it once, no big deal. More than once?  depending, it can have performance impact.
[09:04:16] <duch_kazatel> it's also more readable to use variables anyway.
[09:04:21] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: I guess I was wondering if $() had a fast path for things like document
[09:04:49] <duch_kazatel> it'll have a "fast-ish" path, but it still needs to spit out a new jquery object with all the methods and properties on it.
[09:05:02] <duch_kazatel> like, there's an inherent overhead you can't "fast-path" away.
[09:05:44] <glaucom> SirLagz:
[09:07:22] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: thank you
[09:09:07] <krambiorix> hi, when focussing (with up and down arrows) the value of the autocomplete item is being inserted in the autocomplete input box. How can i stop that?
[09:09:33] <Wafamde> duch_kazatel, is this what you were thinking? http://pastebin.com/26j1hdJf
[09:11:04] <duch_kazatel> (function () {  $(document).ready(function () { lol
[09:11:10] <duch_kazatel> that's really redundant in this cas.
[09:11:13] <duch_kazatel> *case
[09:11:25] <duch_kazatel>  $(parent.children()[i]).removeClass("fa-star-active"); is interesting, too.
[09:11:33] <Wafamde> Its just a habit, cant hurt I guess.
[09:11:36] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, basic idea is right.
[09:11:45] <duch_kazatel> use .eq()
[09:11:47] <duch_kazatel> or .each()
[09:12:04] <duch_kazatel> you're grabbing raw dom nodes and then converting them back into jquery objects.
[09:12:34] <Wafamde> Oooh idnt know eq() Defo useful
[09:12:41] <duch_kazatel> even better, $(this).parent().find('.fa-star-set').removeClass('fa-star-set');
[09:12:52] <duch_kazatel> also, for loops on jquery objects are no bueno.
[09:13:07] <duch_kazatel> use .each() on jquery objects instead.
[09:13:24] <Wafamde> Is it faster than a normal for?
[09:13:35] <duch_kazatel> the jquery object isn't a true array.
[09:13:38] <duch_kazatel> and for loops are gross.
[09:13:47] <duch_kazatel> also: don't prematurely optimize - it's much more readable :)
[09:14:10] <Wafamde> Yeah I know I should wait. Things just got so interesting that I cant help myself :P
[09:14:13] <Lost123> hi i am iterating thorugh all links of a page using jQuery("[href]").each(function() { , how can i iterate through links in a certain div?
[09:14:26] <Wafamde> Probably have to change it all again tomorrow when I hook it up to SignalR
[09:14:28] <duch_kazatel> Lost123 you use.find()
[09:14:47] <Lost123> like how?
[09:14:53] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery find
[09:14:55] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .find() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ https://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:14:59] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:15:01] <Lost123> for example i want to iterate through all links in #sidebar?
[09:15:33] <duch_kazatel> $('div').find('a').filter( function() { return this.href } ).each(function() { /* do things here */ });
[09:15:41] <duch_kazatel> you want to enumerate, not iterate fwiw :)
[09:17:34] <Lost123> how about var $all_sidebar_html=$("li.item-ii" ).find( "#sidebar" );$all_sidebar_html.$("[href]").each(function() {   duch_kazatel
[09:19:52] <krambiorix> anyone?  when focussing (with up and down arrows) the autocomplete list, the value of the autocomplete item is being inserted in the autocomplete input box. How can i stop that?
[09:20:04] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix what have you tried?
[09:20:12] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery ui to do this?
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> some more detail would be nice.
[09:20:24] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, yes, jquery ui
[09:21:18] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-focus
[09:28:42] <duch_kazatel> welp
[09:31:43] <notchris> If I make an ajax post request to a login form on my own site, the "data" returned is the logged in users profile.
[09:31:55] <notchris> Instead I want to validate wether the user logged in or not
[09:32:13] <taplar_food> 200 should be valid
[09:32:18] <duch_kazatel> depends on the backend.
[09:32:24] <duch_kazatel> can you modify the server-side?
[09:34:40] <duch_kazatel> notchris the right thing to do here is modify the server response to some kind of success/failure setup.
[09:35:38] <duch_kazatel> if you can't do that, what sort of response do you get if the user failed to log in?  maybe find a property on the returned object and use its presence as your success?
[09:36:41] <notchris> duch_kazatel: There is a "LOGGEDIN" variable that is set the username if the user is logged in
[09:36:50] <duch_kazatel> then test for that.
[09:36:57] <duch_kazatel> if you really can't modify the server response.
[09:37:22] <notchris> But the response from the server is text
[09:37:26] <notchris> Or the content of the page
[09:37:31] <taplar_food> response code
[09:37:34] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:37:45] <duch_kazatel> notchris then the endpoint needs to modified entirely.
[09:37:50] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're hacking something together.
[09:38:48] <notchris> Well even if the credentials are wrong you still get the success message
[09:38:55] <duch_kazatel> ...
[09:38:55] <notchris> Because it sends the request to the page
[09:39:03] <duch_kazatel> you mean a 200 or...?
[09:40:43] <duch_kazatel> (you're not giving us enough information)
[09:41:34] <notchris> Im sorry
[09:41:47] <notchris> Let me read up on this process and I can provide a better explanation
[09:42:32] <duch_kazatel> the Right Thingâ„¢ to do here is to setup an endpoint for authentication.
[09:42:44] <taplar_food> ^
[09:42:58] <taplar_food> 200 good, 401 unauthorized
[09:43:34] <taplar_food> 500 $h!&
[09:44:03] <mentoc> Shiand?
[09:44:31] <taplar_food> lol
[09:46:07] <jquery500> hey guys! anyone can help me with chaining .done callbacks?
[09:46:25] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ jquery500
[09:46:32] <duch_kazatel> awww bat b-0t :(
[09:46:35] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[09:47:03] <jquery500> I have defefrred obj with several done callbacks
[09:47:07] <jquery500> like so
[09:47:30] <jquery500> deferred.done(newPaxHandler,spinner).done(provService(serviceType)).fail(errorHandler);
[09:48:10] <taplar_food> uh, that second done looks like an invocation rather than a definition
[09:48:20] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:48:25] <duch_kazatel> looks like an error there.
[09:48:40] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 are you about to say something about that .fail() call not working right?
[09:49:01] <jquery500> no errros here
[09:49:05] <jquery500> all works fine
[09:49:13] <jquery500> but I have problem with newPaxHandler just setup glogabl variable. And provService used this variable and  argument serviceType for another action
[09:49:15] <duch_kazatel> that second .done() isn't doing what you think it is.
[09:49:30] <duch_kazatel> basically, you can't do .done(provService(serviceType))
[09:49:35] <duch_kazatel> that's not how you call that function.
[09:49:39] <duch_kazatel> .done(provService) is right
[09:50:05] <taplar_> unless it's the rare case that that function call returns the callback
[09:50:18] <jquery500> It works with argument - there is no problem
[09:50:24] <duch_kazatel> actuyally it doesn't
[09:50:35] <jrockjiggz> how to select html dom elements but not text?
[09:50:37] <duch_kazatel> i call tell you right now that's not doing what you think it is.
[09:50:41] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz you can't.
[09:50:54] <jrockjiggz> kk
[09:51:04] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz are you trying to bind a listener to something that doesn't exist yet?
[09:51:06] <jquery500> okay. can I type all code? it's about 30 lines
[09:51:13] <taplar_> fiddle it
[09:51:17] <duch_kazatel> jquery share a fiddle or bpaste or something.
[09:51:27] <jrockjiggz> duch_kazatel: no, i have <td>sometext<br><span>..</span></td> i want <td>someText</td>
[09:51:27] <jquery500> fiddle is ok
[09:51:50] <duch_kazatel> jrockjiggz oh that's what you want - check out .contents().  you need to grab that text node.
[09:52:06] <jrockjiggz> $('td>*').remove() deletes text
[09:52:07] <jrockjiggz> ah
[09:52:27] <duch_kazatel> $('td').find('span').remove() would be better
[09:56:40] <jrockjiggz> contents() worked great, ty
[10:06:27] <jquery500> duch_kazatel I can not fiddle it cause it uses backend for core functions. I've tried but there are too much for reworking((
[10:06:39] <sirpacha> Hello
[10:06:42] <duch_kazatel> don't need a functioning example in this case, jquery500
[10:07:13] <jquery500> but how can I fiddle it?
[10:07:19] <jquery500> without example
[10:07:21] <duch_kazatel> i just want to see the code.
[10:07:31] <jquery500> ohhh
[10:07:33] <jquery500> okay
[10:07:34] <jquery500> 5 sec
[10:09:13] <sirpacha> anyone care to help me out with some code? http://jsfiddle.net/88A9S/34/   basically current code only allows me to switch content of 2 divs (using a ? : ) and I do not know how to recode this so that it can switch from the content of more than 2 divs (x divs)
[10:09:29] <jquery500> duch_kazatel it's ready https://jsfiddle.net/mj7gq94b/
[10:09:50] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha you can't use IDs in that case.
[10:09:55] <duch_kazatel> you need to use classes.
[10:10:23] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 .done(provService(serviceType)) yeah, this isn't doesn what you think it is.
[10:10:24] <duch_kazatel> it'
[10:10:33] <duch_kazatel> *it's running proService immediately.
[10:10:41] <jquery500> it works
[10:10:44] <sirpacha> Thanks for the input duch_kazatel
[10:10:46] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you want.
[10:10:51] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 "it works" incorrectly.
[10:11:03] <jquery500> no))) i've debug it
[10:11:07] <jquery500> and it works
[10:11:10] <duch_kazatel> you asked for feedback - if you're going to simply reject it, why would I help?
[10:11:15] <sirpacha> how would I go about to change this?
[10:11:29] <jquery500> the thing is another!))
[10:11:30] <taplar_> sirpacha: what is the intended functionality?
[10:11:48] <sirpacha> i am a real noob, trying to read the doc from jquery  append()  but doesnt really help
[10:12:13] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 you said the code doesn't do what you expect.  there's a relatively major error in your code that can cause some confusion.
[10:12:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:12:17] <sirpacha> I just want to switch the content of a div (from a hidden set of divs)
[10:12:32] <jquery500> May be there is missunderstanding
[10:12:38] <taplar_> so, first, second, third, ....., back to first, and repeat?
[10:12:40] <jquery500> I want to ask obout other thing
[10:13:11] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 feel free to repeat the question, but you've got a major error in your code that will cause you problems, if it isn't already.
[10:13:40] <maxi_> yo
[10:14:07] <claytonzaugg> Where can I go to look at UI Library design ideas?
[10:14:14] <maxi_> what up yall... just finished adding jquery to my windows javascript autocomplete app... simple ahk program
[10:16:52] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[10:18:21] <sirpacha> taplar_: functionality should be : switch the content of a div (from a hidden set of divs) with a timer, I found a working code on SO to do that but it seems to be limited to swapping 2 divs. duch_kazatel proposed that I used classes instead of ids .. this seems like a good idea but I have no idea how to do it
[10:19:00] <taplar_> sirpacha: here's a little pointer
[10:19:01] <taplar_> http://jsfiddle.net/88A9S/35/
[10:22:12] <sirpacha> taplar_:  I am not sure that I understand your pointer. So you created a css class to hide the divs. You added the class as a variable in the js... but what should we do with it now?
[10:22:29] <taplar_> it's used to select your step collection
[10:22:41] <taplar_> so then, logically, what do you want to do with those
[10:25:33] <sirpacha> well, if I wanted to remove the class the div would appear. but not replace
[10:25:47] <duch_kazatel> one sec.  let me show you the other way to approach this.
[10:26:15] <jquery500> duch_kazatel I've wrote very easy example that illustrates my question!
[10:26:25] <duch_kazatel> great.
[10:27:29] <jquery500> that's it https://jsfiddle.net/mj7gq94b/3/
[10:27:47] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/88A9S/38/
[10:27:55] <duch_kazatel> get the idea?
[10:28:18] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 huh?
[10:28:27] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to defer a .done() until another .done() has happened?
[10:28:30] <jquery500> try to run it
[10:28:49] <jquery500> I want to chain them
[10:29:10] <duch_kazatel> because that entirely misses the point of deferreds.  if you really need that, create another deferred that you resolve separately and go from there.
[10:29:11] <jquery500> In this example I want be sure that previous callback was done
[10:30:11] <jquery500> I thought about it. But is there other way?
[10:30:21] <duch_kazatel> that's the "right" way to do it imo.
[10:30:56] <jquery500> okay. thanks. I got that i want - there is only one way
[10:31:00] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mj7gq94b/4/
[10:31:03] <duch_kazatel> not true.
[10:31:09] <duch_kazatel> there's more than one way, but this is the "cleanest"
[10:31:17] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to use deferreds, use them.
[10:31:19] <jquery500> okay. thanks!
[10:31:19] <sirpacha> duch_kazatel:  I am trying to decypher your code
[10:31:34] <duch_kazatel> any questions?
[10:31:40] <duch_kazatel> pretty easy overall.
[10:32:27] <sirpacha> Yes I get it
[10:32:36] <sirpacha> one question only
[10:32:48] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 but that issue with your code and the function call is still bad.
[10:32:51] <sirpacha> does it only applies to the text in the divs ?
[10:33:00] <duch_kazatel> that .done() is totally unnecessary in your code.
[10:33:09] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha sure, but you could easily modify that part.
[10:33:21] <jquery500> yeah. Now I've understood it
[10:37:48] <jquery500> duch_kazatel But I still do not have clear view for chaining $.ajax(((( For example some deferred.done(callback that doing something).done(another callback that used previous callback data or need to wait previos callback)...... May I use deferred objects like flags for chaining callbacks one by another?
[10:38:04] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 that's not how those work.
[10:38:11] <duch_kazatel> each .done() returns the original promise, basiclaly.
[10:38:23] <jquery500> original...
[10:38:40] <duch_kazatel> so someDeferred.done().done().done() <- all of those done() calls are acting on someDeferred.
[10:39:01] <jquery500> and how to chain it?
[10:39:04] <sirpacha> duch_kazatel: how so?  I think the entire idea of using the "ids" instead of classes was in the end to be able to copy the full content of the div ( useful for complex content)
[10:39:16] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha you don't need IDs in that case.
[10:39:37] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha look at your original version. iirc it was doing a .contents().clone()
[10:39:38] <killa_kyle> hmm I'm getting a syntax error, unrecognized expression: http://192.168.10.104:5757/wp-content/themes/brew-master/landing-expert-modal.php/?ID=16120. all I'm trying to do is print the href property of a link to console on click
[10:39:40] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 you don't.
[10:39:57] <killa_kyle> grabbing it by var href = $(this).prop('href');            console.log(href);
[10:40:01] <jquery500> but what is the way for chaining callbacks?
[10:40:11] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 for what you wnat, it doesn't exist.
[10:40:15] <sirpacha> yes duch_kazatel  I tried to implement this part into your code but it does not seem to be working..
[10:40:17] <duch_kazatel> killa_kyle can't see that script.
[10:40:23] <duch_kazatel> sirpacha show me what you have :)
[10:40:32] <duch_kazatel> killa_kyle that's an internal IP - make a fiddle or bpaste or something.
[10:40:43] <jquery500> Idea about using deferred objects like flags is a bad idea?)))
[10:40:54] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 "like flags" sounds strange.
[10:40:59] <duch_kazatel> you have objects - act on them.
[10:41:25] <jquery500> I ment like trggers for going to another callback after previous
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> jquery500 yeah, you can't do that.
[10:41:44] <duch_kazatel> deferreds exist to get away from callbacks.
[10:41:57] <killa_kyle> does it matter what the IP is? duch_kazatel, I'm getting the error while only trying to console.log()
[10:41:58] <duch_kazatel> create new deferreds and manually resolve/reject them as necessary.
[10:42:05] <duch_kazatel> killa_kyle i can't see your code...
[10:42:10] <jquery500> seems it's a way
[10:42:11] <duch_kazatel> killa_kyle so i can't really help.  sorry!
[10:42:15] <jquery500> thanks
[10:42:21] <shoky> jquery500 .then will create a new promise based on what you return/throw inside, that allows you to pipe or perhaps "chain" deferreds, maybe you want that..?  but i agree that using them as flags sounds weird so who knows what you really want
[10:43:18] <jquery500> thanks everyone! I'll try to use deferred resolve n reject methods for implementing my idea
[10:44:59] <MercurialHg> $(irc).post("Hello");
[10:45:25] <MercurialHg> there should be an API for IRC in JQuery
[10:45:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't make any sense.
[10:45:42] <taplar_> that sounds dom
[10:45:48] <shoky> yea, all those irc cross-client bugs
[10:45:49] <duch_kazatel> taplar_ hahahahahaha
[10:45:50] <MercurialHg> yup
[10:46:04] <duch_kazatel> plus the server-side part of things.
[10:46:21] <shoky> yes jquery for irc servers too plz.
[10:46:55] <MercurialHg> i should do an irc bot that processes jquery commands
[10:47:06] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[10:47:15] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to simulate a document?]
[10:47:20] <MercurialHg> yup
[10:47:34] <duch_kazatel> how are you going to demonstrate visual changes to it?
[10:47:46] <MercurialHg> no way :(
[10:48:00] <Uhkis> js> print("why?");
[10:48:00] <duch_kazatel> just use jsffidle ;)
[10:48:02] <b-ot> Uhkis: why?
[10:48:21] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:51:52] <sirpacha> duch_kazatel:  http://jsfiddle.net/88A9S/45/ it seems im going nowhere  :(
[10:53:00] <duch_kazatel> $currentStep
[10:53:07] <duch_kazatel> not $(currentIndex)
[10:54:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/88A9S/49/
[10:55:24] <sirpacha> http://jsfiddle.net/88A9S/50/
[10:55:34] <sirpacha> thanks a lot
[10:56:09] <duch_kazatel> ($currentStep) is totally unnecessary.
[10:56:50] <duch_kazatel> just do http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/88A9S/52/
[10:56:56] <sirpacha> you mean the brackets?
[10:57:02] <duch_kazatel> the parens, yeah.
[10:57:15] <sirpacha> yup
[10:57:15] <Kartagis> what does $var mean?
[10:57:24] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis it's a variable.
[10:57:40] <Kartagis> I know, but why $ ?
[10:57:41] <killa_kyle> http://jsbin.com/fuqixakuwa/edit?html,js,console,output @duch_kazatel  that code works fine in the jsbin but gives me syntax error on my live install
[10:57:55] <duch_kazatel> signifies it's a jquery object.
[10:58:04] <duch_kazatel> helps you avoid doing $($somejqueryobject)
[10:58:38] <duch_kazatel> killa_kyle no idea
[10:58:47] <duch_kazatel> if it doesn't break in the bin i have no idea.
[10:59:01] <killa_kyle> yeah it's weird, it gives the error but still works correctly
[10:59:09] <killa_kyle> on my actually install
[10:59:12] <sirpacha> thx a lot for the help duch_kazatel, now I can get back to html5 and css ;)  have a good day
[10:59:25] <duch_kazatel> make sure you have proper closing parents and stuff killa_kyle
[11:00:09] <DukeDrake> hi
[11:01:06] <taplar_> kon'nichiwa
[11:02:07] <DukeDrake> I'm trying "FormData" stuff for the first time and somehow the data doesn't reach my server ...
[11:02:46] <mentoc> DukeDrake: can you see that traffic in your web developer's console?
[11:03:49] <DukeDrake> yes, the data gets sent but I'm afraid not properly or somethin
[11:04:13] <DukeDrake> hang on, I'll paste some stuff to the bin ...
[11:04:16] <mentoc> DukeDrake: I'm guessing you're sending this via ajax? Possibly a file uploaded?
[11:05:04] <DukeDrake> yes. Well ... it's intended to become a file uploader, but I consolidated to a simple text fiels
[11:06:33] <DukeDrake> hmm .... what happened to the simple bins where you could just paste code? xD
[11:06:41] <duch_kazatel> bpaste
[11:07:46] <mentoc> pastebin.com too complicated for ya? :P
[11:07:52] <duch_kazatel> pastebin sucks imo.
[11:08:28] <mentoc> I like pastebin because of it's "trending pastes" feature. "Oh look, another Ashley Madison password dump"
[11:08:41] <DukeDrake> http://jsbin.com/fowajiguqi/edit?js
[11:09:01] <taplar_> is it weird i read that as 'trending pasties'?
[11:09:26] <mentoc> DukeDrake: looks like business as usual. What's your server side language?
[11:09:33] <DukeDrake> php
[11:09:35] <mentoc> erm nvm i see the .php
[11:09:53] <DukeDrake> hang on, it's only one line xD
[11:09:55] <mentoc> all that data should be in $_POST
[11:10:04] <DukeDrake> if(!empty($_POST)) print_r($_POST); exit(0);
[11:10:23] <DukeDrake> it's not outputting anything, though ....
[11:10:49] <mentoc> Is there anything else being appended to formData?
[11:11:27] <mentoc> I had a problem with PHP's upload limits when sending a file through formData. Essentially $_POST won't be populated if you exceed the upload/post max size in your .ini file
[11:11:59] <mentoc> but if all you're sending is one post data line, then that shouldn't be the case
[11:12:39] <DukeDrake> if I omit "contentType: false,", there's somthing in POST, although quite weird =)
[11:13:06] <mentoc> You usually only need contentType: false when you're uploading a file
[11:13:41] <mentoc> if you're just sending one small string through ajax, I wouldn't even bother using formdata
[11:14:09] <DukeDrake> it's intended to become a file upload .... %)
[11:14:40] <mentoc> Then you'll need it
[11:15:04] <glaucom> still I could not get the blessed post in php.You believe? Can anyone help me ?
[11:15:12] <DukeDrake> is there anything I can do to better "understand", what's happening?
[11:16:00] <mentoc> DukeDrake: I'm all out of ideas :/
[11:16:38] <duch_kazatel> is the issue with PHP or jquery?
[11:17:27] <glaucom> duch_kazatel: page in jquery and ajax, posting in php
[11:17:45] <duch_kazatel> right, so which side of the equation is broken?
[11:17:49] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'm asking
[11:18:04] <maxi_> windows javascript and jquery autocomplete... http://visoogle.info/JavaScript%20and%20jQuery%20Autocomplete/  please let me know if you find it useful
[11:18:16] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com is a good primer to figure out what's broken.
[11:18:26] <duch_kazatel> maxi_ find what useful?  autocomplete?
[11:18:38] <maxi_> yeah, I use fiddle alot
[11:18:45] <duch_kazatel> uh
[11:18:45] <maxi_> and wanted autocomplete anywher
[11:18:47] <duch_kazatel> what is that link?
[11:18:49] <maxi_> as well as instant help
[11:18:59] <maxi_> if you type h then any method or property
[11:19:10] <duch_kazatel> uh
[11:19:14] <maxi_> it pops up with help as long as its running and shows the shortcut in the future
[11:19:16] <duch_kazatel> just use an editor that has that.
[11:19:31] <maxi_> cssdeck, jsbin, codepen
[11:19:36] <maxi_> ?
[11:19:44] <maxi_> I help people alot
[11:19:44] <duch_kazatel> sublime text, intellij, eclipse...
[11:19:53] <glaucom> duch_kazatel: download this ... http://devoops.me/themes/devoops/devoops.zip
[11:19:56] <duch_kazatel> you don't need a full separate exe running for that.
[11:19:59] <duch_kazatel> glaucom uh.
[11:20:05] <glaucom> so I can explain it better.
[11:20:06] <duch_kazatel> glaucom i don't do php.
[11:20:16] <maxi_> I've found it extremly useful.
[11:20:22] <duch_kazatel> and asking me to download an entire zip for an applicatiuon is a little... heavy-handed.
[11:20:33] <duch_kazatel> maxi_ i don't dobut it, just seems unnecessary.
[11:20:33] <glaucom> php is just a simple echo in the variable. relax.
[11:20:50] <duch_kazatel> glaucom i'm not stressing, you're just not listening :)
[11:21:30] <glaucom> I'm using translator. hahaha
[11:21:56] <duch_kazatel> okay.  either way, check out fixingthesejquery.com.  otherwise, share the js in a fiddle or something.
[11:22:08] <duch_kazatel> glaucom i
[11:22:16] <glaucom> php only has an echo in a variable. received by post.
[11:22:22] <duch_kazatel> *i'm trying to help direct you to the right place to get help.
[11:31:30] <SirPacha> duch_kazatel, when I try to implement the code we worked on before on my local test website it seems not to be working
[11:31:31] <SirPacha> http://pastebin.com/Yb3nfnKY
[11:32:04] <SirPacha> the results is that it shows : Content A ... then blank... and it stays blank
[11:32:46] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/32swuzot/1/
[11:32:47] <duch_kazatel> try this?
[11:32:58] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, no idea.
[11:36:28] <SirPacha> haizz
[11:36:39] <SirPacha> so it was the $  before function
[11:36:49] <duch_kazatel> also gets rid of the () at the end.
[11:36:55] <duch_kazatel> run it in a document ready instead.
[11:37:26] <SirPacha> you mean directly in the html file right
[11:37:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:37:43] <duch_kazatel> i mean in your JS.

[13:18:57] <duch_kazatel> use $(this) to figure out what the current item is.

[13:33:17] <DukeDrake> re
[13:33:35] <DukeDrake> if anyone is interested: it didn't work because of the jquey version ....

[13:38:51] <mentoc> DukeDrake: what's that now?

[13:40:39] <DukeDrake> yupp
[13:41:24] <mentoc> DukeDrake: how was the version a problem?
[13:43:35] <DukeDrake> well ... with jquery 1.11 the fields were in $_POST ... but not with jquery 1.4
[13:43:54] <DukeDrake> I guess that's a pity, because the application I wrote is a bit dependant on jQuery 1.4
[13:44:35] <DukeDrake> .... and jquery-ui-1.7
[16:10:51] <BostonGeorge2k> hi there, any one has an idea how to fix this bug: the text moves behind the black bar once it sticks to the top : http://jsfiddle.net/livibetter/HV9HM/
[16:11:13] <BostonGeorge2k> it should still be readable if black bar gets sticky
[16:11:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:11:26] <BostonGeorge2k> scroll down a litle
[16:11:30] <duch_kazatel> i did.
[16:11:41] <BostonGeorge2k> the text Nunc eu sapien turpis. Proin non arc ..
[16:11:47] <BostonGeorge2k> gets behind it, right
[16:11:54] <duch_kazatel> the text on the page?
[16:12:02] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[16:12:05] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:12:41] <duch_kazatel> so you don't want to be able to see text to the right?
[16:12:41] <BostonGeorge2k> its an odd behavior
[16:13:04] <BostonGeorge2k> the text should normally scroll
[16:13:12] <BostonGeorge2k> not "jump" behind the black bar once it gets sticky
[16:13:29] <duch_kazatel> oh that part.  you need to add a margin or otherwise offset the set to whatever the header occupied.
[16:14:11] <BostonGeorge2k> hmm
[16:16:01] <BostonGeorge2k> not sure how
[16:16:45] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:18:16] <BostonGeorge2k> sure :)
[16:37:34] <duch_kazatel> so where are you lost?
[16:42:03] <BostonGeorge2k> its still the text hiding behin the bar
[16:42:07] <duch_kazatel> right.
[16:42:11] <duch_kazatel> you need to add code.
[16:42:15] <BostonGeorge2k> tried to add a margin but did pretty bad :D
[16:42:21] <duch_kazatel> show me what you tried.
[16:42:46] <duch_kazatel> also - fwiw you're still going to have text "behind" the heading.  that'll require other code to fix.
[16:42:54] <BostonGeorge2k> http://jsfiddle.net/HV9HM/3133/
[16:43:19] <BostonGeorge2k> yes, i might need to work myself more into it
[16:44:08] <duch_kazatel> you want to do it to just the follow <p> tag, not all of them,.
[16:47:16] <BostonGeorge2k> it's a crappy approach i guess
[16:50:18] <duch_kazatel> http://stickyjs.com/
[16:50:23] <duch_kazatel> just use something like this and call it a day.
[17:02:37] <guessx> BostonGeorge2k, have you thought of just extending the width 100%?
[17:02:47] <duch_kazatel> guessx that's part of the issue.
[17:03:08] <duch_kazatel> guessx the page jumps when the header is changed to fixed positioning - that's the other concern.
[17:15:39] <tommys> hey! im having a whole hover function I did and I then noticed that if the cursor is staying on the element the fucntion isn't being called as well. how can I make it to call the function even if the cursor is on the element?
[17:15:51] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[17:15:58] <tommys> some 'active' I belive?
[17:16:15] <tommys> "hover&&active" ?
[17:16:24] <duch_kazatel> 'active' is not an event,.
[17:16:32] <duch_kazatel> you might want mouseenter and mouseleave instead?
[17:17:13] <tommys> cool, I'll check that out
[17:17:41] <tommys> O! I actually have an idea that maybe will be quicker!
[17:17:44] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:18:10] <tommys> is there a way to check at the end of my hove function if the mouse is currently on one of the elements in a certein class, and if so - send it to the hover function?
[17:18:15] <tommys> hover*
[17:18:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[17:18:41] <duch_kazatel> something here seems off.
[17:18:44] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle?
[17:18:54] <tommys> ill explain again :) (and better!)
[17:18:58] <Robdgreat> how do you delegate to a function *from that function*?
[17:18:59] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[17:19:13] <duch_kazatel> except that's not even delegating.
[17:19:21] <duch_kazatel> and the whole eventing mental model here is suspect.
[17:19:38] <tommys> My code is really unorginized right now, I think a fiddle will be very hard to understand. Ill try another clearer explanation and if it wouldnt do Ill make a fiddle :)
[17:19:52] <duch_kazatel> i don't want all of your code.
[17:19:58] <duch_kazatel> i want an isolated case of just the handler.
[17:20:14] <tommys> alright :|
[17:21:21] <tommys> there: https://jsfiddle.net/gsut12v6/
[17:22:00] <duch_kazatel> so you're trying to show the current "active" one?
[17:22:44] <tommys> yes, in case the animation for the slide is over and the cursor has already moved to somewhere else, I want the new "sliding" to take place
[17:23:00] <duch_kazatel> what's the animation?
[17:23:03] <tommys> because of the exit condition that check if an animation is in proccess
[17:23:10] <tommys> its just an regular animate function
[17:23:16] <duch_kazatel> you don't want an "exit condition"
[17:23:17] <duch_kazatel> one se.c
[17:23:35] <tommys> reffered to :  if ((curSlideId === nextSlideId) || $(curSlideId).is(':animated') || $(nextSlideId).is(':animated')) {             return;         }
[17:23:36] <tommys> of course
[17:23:50] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xx57coe/
[17:23:52] <duch_kazatel> this is the basic gist.
[17:23:53] <tommys> y dont I want this?
[17:24:12] <duch_kazatel> because it takes a lot more wrangling to achieve.
[17:24:25] <duch_kazatel> notice how i got like 85% of the way there in 4 lines? :)
[17:24:58] <duch_kazatel> that addclass/removeclass setup could be to animate things or do all sorts of stuff.
[17:25:38] <tommys> the exit condition is just because of the slideshow animation
[17:25:49] <duch_kazatel> you don't need an exit condition.
[17:25:50] <tommys> its pretty much impossible to the slideshow to look nice without it
[17:25:51] <duch_kazatel> that's my entire point.
[17:26:10] <duch_kazatel> you add a class.  when you mouseenter another thing, remove that class/reverse the animation.
[17:26:35] <tommys> I don't want it to stop the animation, I want it to hold still and wait til shes over
[17:26:47] <duch_kazatel> then don't stop it?
[17:26:50] <tommys> thats the point
[17:26:51] <tommys> nop
[17:26:56] <tommys> it 0.4 of a second anyway
[17:26:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:28:29] <tommys> its a quicking sliding animation between the slides, If the user hover to another link while the animation is in proccess, I want my program to wait untill the last sliding effect is over, and only then move to the next one
[17:28:48] <duch_kazatel> so you want to purposefully slow down the user?
[17:28:58] <tommys> thats what made it so complecated for me and had me write the exit point that checks if an animation is in proccess
[17:28:59] <duch_kazatel> why not just stop the current animation?
[17:29:32] <tommys> if the animation will stop, then the whole flow of the site looks off
[17:29:54] <duch_kazatel> you stop AND revert is my point.
[17:29:57] <tommys> and I dont think its really "slows him down", its just an 0.4 animation
[17:30:05] <duch_kazatel> half a second is an eternity.
[17:30:08] <tommys> hmm
[17:30:16] <tommys> I see what you mean
[17:30:37] <tommys> thats a lot more coding :) but yeah lets give it a show
[17:30:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xx57coe/2/
[17:30:41] <tommys> shot
[17:30:48] <duch_kazatel> hardly any coding.
[17:30:51] <duch_kazatel> already done there.
[17:31:03] <duch_kazatel> swap the animate calls with whatever you want to do and you're done.
[17:31:17] <tommys> yeah but that animation is much easier :(
[17:31:42] <duch_kazatel> you get the idea though.
[17:31:43] <tommys> mine is kind of more annoying to code
[17:31:45] <duch_kazatel> like... pretty basic stuff.
[17:31:46] <tommys> yeah
[17:31:55] <tommys> but let me ask you one more thing
[17:31:56] <duch_kazatel> i don't see any animation in your fiddle fwiw.
[17:32:26] <tommys> because thats in another function
[17:32:51] <tommys> its not done yet, here the point: im having a slideshow who slides pictures to the left (right now, later i'll add the other way around)
[17:32:57] <tommys> heres*
[17:33:19] <tommys> and the container div is streching to 100%, that took me ages to make it look right
[17:33:26] <tommys> (keep in mind im just learing jquery!)
[17:33:40] <duch_kazatel> something here seems off.
[17:33:48] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a carousel.
[17:33:48] <tommys> what? :(
[17:34:01] <tommys> whats carousel?
[17:34:04] <duch_kazatel> can you show me a functioning version of what you're making?
[17:34:20] <tommys> yeah, ill upload it in a second
[17:34:26] <tommys> hold on
[17:38:36] <tommys> 1 Minute..
[17:39:24] <duch_kazatel> i have to get going sooon sooooo
[17:39:32] <tommys> really one minute
[17:39:37] <tommys> just a lot of heaving pics :|
[17:39:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:39:54] <duch_kazatel> you're not like zipping this to send it to me are you?
[17:40:51] <tommys> im uploading it as you asked :D
[17:41:01] <tommys> anyway I want to show it to some friends to get some feedback
[17:41:03] <tommys> so why not now
[17:42:38] <tommys> http://techsys.esy.es/
[17:42:39] <tommys> there
[17:43:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's basically a carousel.
[17:43:27] <tommys> whats that?
[17:43:51] <duch_kazatel> http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[17:44:02] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[17:44:45] <tommys> thats a plugin?
[17:44:58] <duch_kazatel> the first one is, the second link explains why you don't do it.
[17:46:20] <tommys> thats doesn't really matter.. Im not building a site for any client.. Im just trying to be better at jquery through it
[17:46:34] <duch_kazatel> and?
[17:46:43] <duch_kazatel> the best developer knows when to not do something :)
[17:46:47] <tommys> and... and going pretty good so far?
[17:46:48] <duch_kazatel> you have a hammer - not everything is a nail.
[17:47:06] <tommys> well, look how much I learn about events using it :)
[17:47:17] <tommys> I set a goal, and thorugh it I learn about various options
[17:47:24] <duch_kazatel> knowing when and how to use the tool appropriately is more valuable than having a wide understanding imo.
[17:47:34] <duch_kazatel> just because you can doesn't mean you should.
[17:47:38] <tommys> plus, even though I heard about how "bad" is a slideshow in general, its still a pretty desired features being asked from client, so I heard
[17:47:48] <tommys> so I dont have it in your tool box :)
[17:48:03] <tommys> clients*
[17:48:04] <duch_kazatel> your job as a developer/designer is to inform your client why carousels are bad.
[17:48:23] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're doing them a disservice and allowing them to sabotage the project.
[17:48:33] <duch_kazatel> then when the site fails to meet whatever goals it has set, they'll come yelling at you.
[17:49:19] <duch_kazatel> like, totally commendable that you've learned some things and you're applying your knowledge.
[17:49:29] <tommys> I recently worked at a student position in some univery website who used a slideshow thorugh a plugin, they didn't want to hear about changing it no matter what, and I suffered during my time trying to manage the webpage, now when I have a little more knowalage at jquery I could have suffered less
[17:49:45] <duch_kazatel> still use a plugin.
[17:49:59] <tommys> (thats the web site btw: http://www.nano.huji.ac.il/)
[17:50:07] <duch_kazatel> just use one that doesn't suck.
[17:50:29] <duch_kazatel> the moment the carousel moves, end users ignore it.
[17:50:38] <tommys> ofcourse, but I was working on blind, I did a lot of try and error any trying to understand the plugin api without understandg the language like.. at all
[17:50:51] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with jquery?
[17:51:02] <tommys> just change the pluging setting
[17:51:06] <tommys> speed: x and stuff like that
[17:51:09] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:51:16] <duch_kazatel> because somebody else already solved that problem for you.
[17:51:30] <tommys> or if I tried to enter picutres that was larger, sometimes the whole laypout went nutz
[17:51:39] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a bad plugin ;)
[17:51:53] <duch_kazatel> don't waste time on something if somebody else has already spend the time solving it for you.
[17:51:54] <tommys> now I can try to manage around the pluging
[17:52:04] <duch_kazatel> use slick or something else and wash your hands of it.
[17:52:05] <tommys> like I learned about the overflow feautre for a div
[17:52:18] <tommys> didn't though I will learn about css, but some how I did
[17:52:22] <tommys> so that was also good expirience
[17:52:43] <tommys> anyway, thats fun, so why not :)
[17:52:44] <duch_kazatel> sure - not saying that it's all for naught, but that doesn't justify bad UX ;)
[17:53:06] <tommys> went looking for answers about the thing im trying to do
[17:53:12] <duch_kazatel> now you have it.
[17:53:19] <duch_kazatel> you want a carousel - many exist :)
[17:53:19] <tommys> I got to soooo many articels about "why this whole slideshow thing is bad"
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:53:27] <duch_kazatel> don't use them.
[17:53:47] <tommys> even though, I see so many websites that probably the clients insist on them
[17:53:53] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't matter.
[17:54:05] <duch_kazatel> they're not designing/developing the site.
[17:54:08] <tommys> so as an advice I can maybe say "you shouldnt" but it seems like a useful tool to know, isnt it?
[17:54:15] <duch_kazatel> hardly.
[17:54:17] <tommys> as was in my past expirience
[17:54:23] <duch_kazatel> it's your job to educate them and show them why they shouldn't use it.
[17:54:33] <tommys> do you have a site u programmed you can show me?
[17:54:35] <duch_kazatel> not just do everything little thing they wish.
[17:54:40] <tommys> to educate me :)
[17:55:01] <duch_kazatel> i work for a fairly large company - we have carousels on a few of our sites and I have plenty of data to show that our end users never interact with them.
[17:55:32] <tommys> because it hides on the end of the carousels?
[17:55:40] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:55:44] <tommys> or because the carousels still the intntion?
[17:55:47] <tommys> of the user
[17:55:49] <duch_kazatel> because the moment the user sees the carousel, they ignore them.
[17:55:50] <tommys> steels
[17:55:53] <tommys> dammit
[17:55:56] <tommys> aha
[17:56:34] <tommys> but what if your whole site present text regions that have anchors to the carousel?
[17:56:40] <duch_kazatel> like yours?
[17:56:52] <tommys> mine still dont have content..
[17:56:54] <duch_kazatel> because now you're introducing something we spend a lot of time minimizing.
[17:57:00] <duch_kazatel> wasted time.
[17:57:00] <tommys> means - clicking on an element on the carousel goes to an anchor down in the page
[17:57:15] <duch_kazatel> when you user shows intent to go somewhere, take them there immediately.
[17:57:31] <tommys> I want to see an example for a site that have good data presenting content
[17:57:53] <tommys> excuse my english btw, I try my best
[17:57:54] <duch_kazatel> http://baymard.com/ is good for the ecommerce world.
[17:58:09] <duch_kazatel> either way, don't use animations and transitions where you can avoid it.
[17:58:14] <duch_kazatel> don't make the user wait.
[17:58:39] <tommys> hmm.. what about like a product webpage? like all those start-up sites the LOVE use those carousels
[17:58:49] <tommys> is there a good way for the presentetion page
[17:58:53] <tommys> other then that?
[17:58:53] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:59:05] <tommys> hmm.. Ill give you an example
[17:59:08] <duch_kazatel> http://baymard.com/blog/ecommerce-quick-views
[17:59:19] <duch_kazatel> here's a good article on the subject that's sort of related.
[17:59:49] <tommys> huh
[17:59:59] <duch_kazatel> already linked it.
[18:00:12] <tommys> il lgive you a quick example, I just googled "start up" and one of the first was that one: http://www.cyberstartupsummit.com/
[18:00:23] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[18:00:29] <tommys> haha
[18:00:33] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating "start up" with "good design"
[18:00:57] <tommys> but you see, all of those sites that mainly have like 4 feautres they want to show: our product, about us, contact us
[18:01:04] <duch_kazatel> sure, and they suck.
[18:01:12] <duch_kazatel> i click a link and you make me wait to see what i want.
[18:01:16] <tommys> so what is the correct thing for them to do?
[18:01:24] <tommys> just page with all of the text
[18:01:26] <tommys> all at once?
[18:01:26] <duch_kazatel> not animate it at the very least.
[18:01:32] <duch_kazatel> take me directly there.
[18:01:58] <tommys> do u have an example for a simple site that have a correct functionally?
[18:02:11] <tommys> with "product, about, contact"
[18:02:24] <tommys> and still looks proffesional and nice?
[18:02:25] <duch_kazatel> literally that page without the animation when you click on the menu.
[18:02:51] <duch_kazatel> that page works, just don't have that animation that scrolls.  take me directly to the content.
[18:02:52] <tommys> aha
[18:02:59] <duch_kazatel> did you ever see start wars episode 1?
[18:03:09] <duch_kazatel> with the pod race that goes on for way too long?
[18:03:21] <tommys> no :)
[18:03:25] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[18:03:27] <tommys> but I see what you mean
[18:03:29] <duch_kazatel> same basic concept.
[18:03:39] <tommys> I hardly ever see this rare kind of sites you talk about
[18:03:50] <duch_kazatel> right, because people forget about usability.
[18:04:04] <tommys> all of my fellow students who finished their degree and went to whole kind of startups and thing like that
[18:04:11] <tommys> they all have the same template
[18:04:16] <duch_kazatel> right.
[18:04:19] <tommys> slideshow, menu to anchors
[18:04:20] <duch_kazatel> and they all look about the same, right?
[18:04:42] <tommys> yes, but still very elegent in my opinion
[18:04:53] <duch_kazatel> but none of them stand out any more.
[18:05:05] <tommys> the thing is, there was a time (before this whole css3) that the websites was like you described
[18:05:14] <tommys> back then it was common
[18:05:23] <tommys> why did it stop then?>
[18:05:35] <duch_kazatel> sure, and before we had amazing green screen and cgi systems you didn't see the pod race scene ;)
[18:05:55] <tommys> I miss the time a designed kids websites with table and iframes :(
[18:05:55] <duch_kazatel> saying "other people are doing it" is terrible rationale.
[18:06:00] <tommys> back then it was all so simple..
[18:06:20] <duch_kazatel> there's no reason things can't look nice.  just don't buy into the hype.
[18:06:36] <duch_kazatel> think about the bigger ecommerce sites - amazon, ebay, even walmart.
[18:06:40] <duch_kazatel> they all keep it simple and fast.
[18:06:42] <tommys> I understand what you say, I also think standing out is better, but I said it in a matter that everyone thinks its nice and "proffesional" now, like it became the standart
[18:06:50] <tommys> (well, not everyone :) )
[18:06:54] <duch_kazatel> "standard" is not "good"
[18:06:58] <duch_kazatel> advocate for end users
[18:07:02] <duch_kazatel> make things that don't suck.
[18:07:23] <tommys> amazon and ebay offers a lot of feautres and functinality in their site
[18:07:31] <tommys> their not just sites with four data segments
[18:07:43] <duch_kazatel> sure, but what sorts of animations do you see there?
[18:07:48] <tommys> I want to see "simple" sites that actually work :)
[18:07:56] <tommys> the really minimilize simple and elegent sites
[18:07:59] <tommys> where are they?
[18:08:09] <duch_kazatel> i just told you.
[18:08:15] <duch_kazatel> keeping things simple is a good thing ;)
[18:08:16] <tommys> amazon, ebay, even walmart?
[18:09:02] <duch_kazatel> on walmart, what happens when you mouseover the "all departments" menu?  it animates, but it's SUPER quick.
[18:09:05] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't make me wait.
[18:09:29] <Enmos> Hello, can someone please help me with a skrollr issue ?
[18:09:45] <duch_kazatel> Enmos just ask your question - if we can help, we will :)
[18:10:22] <tommys> on the other way.. when its not dynamic and the client keeps sending and gets requests, its also take time
[18:10:32] <duch_kazatel> tommys huh?
[18:11:18] <duch_kazatel> you mean when they want to regularly add or change things?
[18:11:29] <Enmos> So i'm using Skrollr, i'm trying to animate-incremente a number when scroll is x
[18:11:56] <tommys> I mean, when using this "one page" strategy with animation, the half second you wait till the animation is over, is like the half second you wait for a new page to load. or that you are saying that using "one page" is good, but just not the animation part
[18:12:22] <duch_kazatel> tommys don't you hate waiting for pages to load?
[18:12:43] <tommys> of course :)
[18:12:54] <duch_kazatel> isn't it inconvenient when you ask for information and, instead of getting that information, the site makes you wait half of a second simply because somebody else thought something looked cool:?
[18:13:16] <duch_kazatel> Enmos do you really need Skrollr for thatr?
[18:13:18] <duch_kazatel> *that
[18:13:46] <Enmos> duch_kazatel: Do you have a better solution ?
[18:14:09] <duch_kazatel> a scroll event listener that checks if the offset is a certain number.
[18:14:18] <tommys> I think there is a fragile balance of when the animation is getting too long for me to wait, and where its jsut right enough for me to get entretained by it
[18:14:27] <tommys> but I think I can still get entreteined\
[18:14:37] <duch_kazatel> but the point isn't for the site to be entertaining - it's to be informative.
[18:14:45] <duch_kazatel> if you want both, keep it really quick.
[18:14:54] <Enmos> duch_kazatel: what i'm did is skrollr adds a class for me when scroll is x, but how can i do with jquery : if an element took a class then function()
[18:15:03] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[18:15:14] <duch_kazatel> Enmos do you just want a number to increment when the page hits an element?
[18:15:21] <Enmos> yep
[18:15:29] <tommys> and if its like a portolio site that suppose to show designing "skills" on top of the information?
[18:15:31] <duch_kazatel> then just detect if the element is in the viewport.
[18:15:32] <Enmos> duch_kazatel: kind of Google animations on storage
[18:15:42] <duch_kazatel> Enmos their whatnow?
[18:15:52] <duch_kazatel> tommys why would you show bad design?
[18:16:32] <Enmos> how can i check if an element is on viewport ?
[18:16:43] <Enmos> is it native on jquery
[18:16:50] <duch_kazatel> easy enough to build.
[18:16:52] <tommys> thats exacly the thing! I just don't think those animation are always bad design! just when they're avoiding the things you want to do in the site!
[18:17:06] <tommys> some time the animations themself can be some kind of information for the user
[18:17:08] <duch_kazatel> then why have the animations in the first place?
[18:17:12] <duch_kazatel> wat
[18:17:16] <duch_kazatel> when can animation be information?
[18:17:25] <tommys> for the portfolio example I talked about earlier
[18:17:38] <jeffreylevesque> i need to lint js files
[18:17:42] <duch_kazatel> http://www.mc2design.com/portfolio/ tommys
[18:17:56] <jeffreylevesque> what are some of the better packages that will allow me to check js syntax?
[18:18:07] <tommys> that's your company?
[18:18:12] <duch_kazatel> tommys nope.
[18:18:18] <duch_kazatel> tommys i work for a large ecommerce company.
[18:18:32] <tommys> who?
[18:18:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying :)\
[18:18:38] <tommys> or.. what?
[18:18:42] <tommys> y :(
[18:18:56] <duch_kazatel> why is it relevant?
[18:19:03] <tommys> out of courity
[18:19:07] <tommys> courosity
[18:19:09] <tommys> damn
[18:19:10] <tommys> :(
[18:19:25] <duch_kazatel> you haven't heard of us.  we're the largest one in our industry though.
[18:19:28] <tommys> curiosity!
[18:19:56] <tommys> alibaba then?
[18:20:00] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:20:01] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:20:07] <duch_kazatel> you haven't heard of us.
[18:20:08] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[18:20:15] <duch_kazatel> jeffreylevesque we use jshint her
[18:20:17] <duch_kazatel> *here
[18:20:33] <tommys> how come you're the biggest and I havent?
[18:20:54] <duch_kazatel> we get plenty of good organic traffic and have a really loyal customer base.
[18:20:58] <tommys> is there a bigger one then alibaba, amazon, ebay? :S
[18:21:04] <duch_kazatel> wrong industry.
[18:21:09] <duch_kazatel> we're not general ecommerce.
[18:21:19] <jeffreylevesque> duch_kazatel: thank you
[18:21:29] <tommys> see, now Im really curiose!
[18:21:44] <Enmos> duch_kazatel: how can i know if an element is on viewport and call a function ?
[18:21:51] <tommys> is that like.. some deep web ecommerce?
[18:21:59] <duch_kazatel> Enmos test if the offset().top is greater than the window's offset().top but less than the window's offset().top + window's height
[18:22:02] <duch_kazatel> tombee no.
[18:22:07] <duch_kazatel> *tommys
[18:22:11] <tommys> :o
[18:22:19] <duch_kazatel> anyway.
[18:23:15] <jeffreylevesque> can i wrong jshint in one line (maybe on more to npm install)?
[18:23:22] <jeffreylevesque> *write
[18:23:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:23:33] <jeffreylevesque> execute jshint
[18:23:40] <jeffreylevesque> i want to put it into my travis ci
[18:23:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah should be able to.
[18:23:55] <duch_kazatel> we use a gulp task for all that.
[18:24:01] <duch_kazatel> could have travis execute the gulp task.
[18:24:15] <jeffreylevesque> gulp, grunt it's too heavy
[18:24:19] <duch_kazatel> wat
[18:24:22] <jeffreylevesque> i write upstart, and systemd
[18:24:31] <jeffreylevesque> and script my own stuff
[18:26:10] <Enmos> Another question, how can i live check if an element took a class ?
[18:26:18] <duch_kazatel> you can't.
[18:27:56] <guessx> hasClass?
[18:28:03] <duch_kazatel> that's not an event listener.
[18:28:20] <Enmos> scroll is an event listener
[18:28:26] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[18:28:32] <duch_kazatel> don't use skrollr.
[18:28:33] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[18:28:55] <Enmos> duch_kazatel: i've already did some cool animations with skroll, missing only one
[18:29:06] <duch_kazatel> then do what i suggested.
[18:29:18] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, skrollr should have that built in.
[18:29:23] <duch_kazatel> i have to go now.
[18:29:23] <duch_kazatel> bye.
[18:29:30] <Enmos> such quick
[18:29:55] <Enmos> so now how to write : test if the offset().top is greater than the window's offset().top but less than the window's offset().top + window's height
[18:31:23] <jeffreylevesque> i'd like to apply jsHint to a directory of javascript filoes
[18:31:47] <jeffreylevesque> can i simply do `jshint --verbose /src/js/*`?
[18:31:52] <jeffreylevesque> do i have to do anything else
[18:35:52] <Enmos> is it correct ? if (  ($('#box').offset().top > window.offset().top) && ($('#box').offset().top < window.offset().top + window.height) )
[18:38:17] <Woet> Enmos: tias
[20:20:17] <aaa__> test
[20:20:26] <aaa__> ok
[20:50:23] <plamble> any idea what this means
[20:50:26] <plamble> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one
[20:56:31] <plamble> if i have an ajax call returning some data
[20:56:41] <plamble> and i want it to replace the html in a certain div
[20:56:43] <plamble> instead of append it
[20:56:50] <plamble> whats the right method for that?
[20:56:53] <plamble> i.e. i want to replace this
[20:56:59] <plamble> $("#ajax").append(data);
[20:57:50] <plamble> .load() ?
[20:59:33] <plamble> maybe .replaceWith()
[21:31:46] <edmund> hi
[21:51:55] <freepixel> hi
[21:53:39] <freepixel> I am having issues concatenating textfield values into the following format NAME^PHONE^DETAILS|NAME^PHONE^DETAILS|... It's the loop. Any help appreciated. http://jsfiddle.net/vd7fda9b/1/
[23:21:57] <hellyeah> yo
[23:22:17] <Uhkis> yo
[23:22:40] <hellyeah> anyone use tablesorter plugin here? i cannot sort datetime column "timeslice" can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/v7a3cr2p/19/
[23:24:55] <Uhkis> works here
[23:28:26] <hellyeah> Uhkis: when you click timeslice did it work?
[23:29:08] <Uhkis> yes, if it's not sorted yet
[23:30:49] <hellyeah> hmm wont work here i dont understrand why when you hit other column it will do sort in both ways. http://jsfiddle.net/19at0hwo/
[23:31:55] <lenswipee> Hi, when I do ajax and echo some text on the server, all I ever get back when I alert out the data is 0. What does this mean?
[23:32:02] <Uhkis> hellyeah: that also works
[23:32:24] <Cork> lenswipee: check the content of the package in the browsers network tab
[23:32:41] <Cork> most likely you're not echoing what you think you are
[23:32:42] <Uhkis> lenswipee: 1) don't use alert 2) what do you get if you normally visit the page?
[23:33:55] <hellyeah> hmm why i didnt see that changes DAMN
[23:33:59] <lenswipee> I simply get 0 from the message from the web
[23:34:12] <Cork> lenswipee: then the server isn't echoing what you think it does
[23:34:34] <lenswipee> Cork: When I console.log(data) it shows 0
[23:34:55] <Cork> lenswipee: yes, so the server is actually returning "0" not the data you expect
[23:35:41] <lenswipee> Cork: on the server-side all I currently have set is echo "Hello World"; exit;
[23:36:09] <Cork> are you using a framework?
[23:36:47] <lenswipee> Cork: wordpress :(. i'll jsfiddle something.
[23:37:02] <robhol> ew, php
[23:37:15] <robhol> ew^16, wordpress
[23:37:22] <Cork> lenswipee: => #wordpress
[23:38:19] <lenswipee> Cork: Yeah I know. Thing is I've done ajax a hundred times in wordpress without a problem. Something is awfully wrong in this situation, and I can't figure it out.
[23:38:35] <Cork> lenswipee: well start looking server side
[23:39:58] <hellyeah> Cork: does it work for you when you hgit timeslice  ?
[23:40:01] <hellyeah> hit*
[23:43:10] <lenswipee> So all I get is 0. Please see this jsfiddle guys: https://jsfiddle.net/hkbrp432/
[23:43:28] <Cork> sigh
[23:43:35] <Cork> lenswipee: you can't solve this client side
[23:44:10] <Cork> the client can't magically create data out of nothing
[23:46:37] <lenswipee> Cork: just need to know I haven't done something weird on the client-side. I think it might have something to do with the form
[23:46:53] <Cork> lenswipee: don't start from the top and go down
[23:47:06] <Cork> make sure the foundation works, then build the house
[23:47:32] <Cork> else you will spend hours debugging problems
[23:48:22] <lenswipee> Cork: I have simplified it already. The problem lies in the ajax code. As soon as I put it there and alert callback data I get 0 always.
[23:48:40] <Cork> lenswipee: you said you got "0" from the server...
[23:48:56] <Cork> again, start by making sure the server works before debugging the client
[23:49:56] <lenswipee> Cork: I get in the 'message from the web' box of 0 when I alert(data)
[23:50:21] <lenswipee> Cork: All server-side does is echo "Hello World"; exit;
[23:51:28] <Uhkis> clearly not on that url
[23:53:51] <lenswipee> Uhkis: could be a url problem...
[23:54:13] <Cork> lenswipee: stop guessing, and start from the ground and make sure things work...
[23:54:23] <Cork> else you will waste everybodys time
[23:54:51] <Cork> don't stubbornly stare at one small section and expect it to be the browser if you look long enough
[23:55:06] <Cork> make sure everything works starting from the source
[23:55:21] <lenswipee> geez, i've stripped it down to bare bones!
