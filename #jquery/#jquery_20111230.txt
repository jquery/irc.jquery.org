[00:05:52] <LordThumper> Is there any way to add the jQuery library to Chrome, so I can use the library from the console from each page?
[00:07:15] <LordThumper> For example Chrome already has a JSON library built it, thought I could add jQuery too
[01:03:45] <Zogot> Morning all
[01:11:46] <rookie84> hi how can i update/not append a certain <div>
[01:11:57] <rookie84> for example <div class="news_list"> </div>
[01:12:05] <rookie84> and i want to overwrite whatever already is inside
[01:12:25] <rookie84> trying to do so $('.news_list').html("......."); but that just appends it to the end of news_list div
[01:12:28] <rookie84> any diea?
[01:12:29] <rookie84> thanks.
[01:13:40] <rahmen> Hi! I have some trouble with the tablesorter plugin: http://pastebin.com/NwvStP7e After an update the rows won't get sortet as they were before...
[01:14:50] <rahmen> rookie84: you should doublecheck your code.. .html() doesn't append. .append() does. :)
[01:15:16] <ssj> yea
[01:15:33] <rookie84> yeh that is what i thought
[01:15:37] <rookie84> let me double check again :)
[01:18:28] <Trudko> guys I know i have mistake somewhere in my conde but IE developer toolbar gives me error  'undefined' is null or not an object in jquery
[01:18:44] <Trudko> how to find out which piece of code is wrong except of debugging
[01:20:07] <Oldskool> Trudko: IE dev toolbar is not very useful, you'd better use something like Chrome/Firebug which has a built-in JS console which should show you the line numbers where things go bad.
[01:22:19] <Trudko> Oldskool: can't use those have to be stuck with IE
[01:23:53] <held> hey guys, how do i select the following tr in this case: http://pastie.org/private/e5enmh1t5dakcea2m0eag
[01:24:08] <held> i can't use next() because the click element is inside the tr
[01:25:23] <rahmen> I just realized that my problem above applies on the example here: http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-ajax.html... if you append data in the example the rows aren't sorted as they are supposed to be... anyone knows a workaround?
[01:25:32] <rahmen> or another plugin that works better :)
[01:30:12] <Oldskool> Trudko: then I'd suggest getting an IDE with JS console built-in .. otherwise it'll be line-by-line debugging hell
[02:17:43] <zitter> hi, i'm using appendTo() method to clone values from select box to another one. It works, but I need something that "substitute" and not append values to target select box. I need to remove values from target select box or does exist an alternative method to do that? tia
[02:23:12] <zitter> ok, worked removing options to target select box

[03:26:09] <dytrivedi> guize a very weird problem
[03:26:44] <dytrivedi> <ul><li style="display: none;"></li><li></li></ul> <--- $('ul li:visible').length is 0
[03:26:53] <dytrivedi> why would that be?
[03:28:47] <dytrivedi> actually, $('#someid ul li:visible').length returns 0
[03:35:48] <hubbl3> dytrivedi: is "#someid" the id of ul?
[03:36:22] <dytrivedi> hubbl3: no the container of ul
[03:38:50] <hubbl3> That's odd, it should return 1. http://jsfiddle.net/kevinflint/TKMsH/
[03:40:45] <dytrivedi> hubbl3: yeah it is baffling.
[03:40:54] <dytrivedi> in production it is acting weird.
[03:41:06] <dytrivedi> 1.6.4 though
[03:41:16] <dytrivedi> but I tried the same in fiddle as well
[03:43:31] <dytrivedi> anyways, will check it thoroughly later. peace.
[03:55:32] <Andreas2k4> anyone a quick idea to generate non-repeating colors in a loop?
[04:04:09] <hubbl3> Andreas2k4: store the generated color in an array.
[04:07:48] <maraujop> Hi, I'm using replaceWith for substituting a label for an input. The new input is not clickable or selectable, any hints?
[04:11:25] <MariusKarthaus> is there a way to find out using javascript if an image has transparancy?
[04:14:26] <ravenzz> if the transparency comes from the opacity property yes
[04:15:14] <maraujop> Ok, is there a way to reattach default handlers to an input ? when they have disconnected before?
[04:15:46] <ravenzz> ?on @ maraujop
[04:15:47] <bot-t1> maraujop, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:17:38] <maraujop> ravenzz: I mean if i do $('input').unbind('click');  is there a way latter to recover default handlers for selection, clicking and all that?
[04:19:07] <MariusKarthaus> ravenzz: no there is no opacity css on the image. What I need to know is if the image itself (gif/png etc) has a transparent background.
[04:22:14] <_ikke_> MariusKarthaus: Afaik not
[04:22:25] <_ikke_> MariusKarthaus: Maybe with the new canvas API or something
[04:23:50] <MariusKarthaus> _ikke_: yea I figured canvas would be the only place it could be known. But I cannot find an 'easy' way of figuring this out. I'll just leave it for now thank you

[05:07:56] <atriv> Hi, i've bound a click event handler to a dom element that is created after the fact. The click event works *once* after that I get no feedback. Can anyone provide any insight?
[05:10:29] <blimey> atriv, I don't have much experience with jquery but firebug is very useful to see the live onclick properties.
[05:11:47] <hubbl3> blimey: item's the index like data[1]["item"]
[05:12:21] <atriv> cool, i've played with firebug before. ill kick it around a bit more
[05:12:21] <nail_> blimey: you can just loop over you array with pure javascript, or if you want it fancy you can also $.each($.grep(data, function(v) { return v.item === 'There'}), function() { /* do whatever you want with 'this' */})
[05:14:11] <blimey> thanks nail, I will give it a go.
[05:16:07] <maraujop> something is block my clicks on an input

[05:16:50] <SoulRaven> hi

[05:17:22] <SoulRaven> and i want to insert a image in each option from dropdown box
[05:17:48] <SoulRaven> the main part is done, but i don't know how to append the div before the value of option
[05:18:33] <nail_> maraujop: with the developper tools, put breakpoints on click events
[05:18:55] <maraujop> nail_: I don't have click events specified
[05:19:01] <maraujop> nail_: in my own JS code
[05:19:12] <maraujop> nail_: There might be a js plugin I have that is causing this, but I'm not sure
[05:19:17] <maraujop> I haven't been able to find anything yet
[05:19:34] <nail_> still, activate breakpoints on click events, it will break when something happens
[05:19:35] <maraujop> that's why I want to attach default input events manually
[05:19:45] <maraujop> nail_: Ohh!
[05:19:55] <dagon666> I would like to execute some function after the page has been loaded, but only if a specific element exists (some div#id). Im not sure which event should I use ?
[05:20:31] <dagon666> ready() seems to be executed everytime regardless of the mentioned element existence
[05:20:41] <maraujop> nail_: where is that option?
[05:21:14] <maraujop> nail_: I just found it
[05:21:20] <nail_> maraujop: "Scripts" tab, on the right there's an "Event Listener Breakpoints"
[05:21:21] <nail_> ah :)
[05:23:35] <maraujop> nail_: Looks like jQuery is the only one in the middle of my click event
[05:23:41] <maraujop> nail_: that's weird
[05:26:55] <maraujop> nail_: Ok I think I've found the culprit
[05:27:23] <maraujop> nail_: Yay! thanks!!!
[05:27:30] <maraujop> nail_: That was a great tip
[05:28:19] <dagon666> nevermind, managed to solve it on my own. Every selector has a length property so $('#element').length == 1 if there is an element with id="element" on the page
[05:28:25] <nail_> maraujop: no worries =)
[05:40:06] <dagon666> can I have multiple $(document).ready(function() {}) ? For example one in every js file ?
[05:45:48] <sKreeMy> http://pastebin.com/r0ibTvV5
[05:45:59] <sKreeMy> can someone tell me why my option:selected.text code is not working?
[05:46:05] <sKreeMy> it's showing as blank instead of the text
[05:51:13] <jamescarr> dagon666, yes, but it's not considered a good idea

[07:31:19] <bonhoffer> i don't want to append or prepend
[07:31:31] <bonhoffer> i just want to insert into . . . is this possible
[07:32:02] <sphinxxx> what do you mean by middle
[07:32:22] <sphinxxx> if the middle row, you need to count how many rows there are, then spend it to the middle tr
[07:32:28] <bonhoffer> not middle, just after $("#foo")
[07:32:42] <bonhoffer> where #foo => <tr id="foo"><td></td> . . .
[07:32:45] <sphinxxx> .after or .insertAfter
[07:32:49] <bonhoffer> nice! thanks
[07:33:03] <bonhoffer> i'll read docs, but what is the quick difference between the two
[07:33:14] <bonhoffer> is one an alias of the other?
[07:33:32] <bonhoffer> i see in the docs: The .after() and .insertAfter() methods perform the same task.
[07:33:36] <sphinxxx> just the syntax,  with .insertAfter() , you place the element you're inserting after, in the ()
[07:33:50] <sphinxxx> with .after its before the .

[07:53:14] <sphinxxx> for example i ahve $sel = $('select option');
[07:53:26] <alessioalex> hello, it seems the new .on method doesn't have the same effects as .live
[07:53:31] <Giverny> how i get the first value in a input?
[07:53:44] <alessioalex> I add new elements on the page and with .on only the old ones have handlers
[07:53:49] <sphinxxx> if i do $sel = $('select option:selected')   it will only work on the initially selected value, no ?
[07:53:54] <alessioalex> I know .live and .delegate shouldn't be used
[07:54:04] <ajpiano> alessioalex: you are probably using it wrong
[07:54:30] <alessioalex> I am using it in the $(function() { ... });
[07:54:37] <ajpiano> alessioalex: the documentation for .live now shows how you would emulate a live call using .on http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:54:50] <alessioalex> I have read that
[07:54:53] <ajpiano> hint: it is NOT $(".foo").on("click", fn)
[07:54:54] <Giverny> ajpiano how i get the first value in input
[07:54:58] <alessioalex> I just don't understand why it doesn't work grrr
[07:55:00] <alessioalex> thanks anyway
[07:55:01] <ajpiano> Giverny: inputs only have one value
[07:55:03] <alessioalex> I'll bug more
[07:55:06] <alessioalex> debug *
[07:55:11] <ajpiano> alessioalex: paste your code somewhere
[07:55:25] <ajpiano> Giverny: unless it's a <select multiple>
[07:55:46] <Giverny> ajpiano not
[07:55:50] <ajpiano> sphinxxx: var options = $("select option");  var selected = options.filter(":selected");
[07:56:36] <Giverny> ajpiano i have a input with .val() but i need first element in this val()
[07:56:44] <poppiez> I have a dialog with a fixed height of 300px with overflow: auto; I want to lazyload a bunch of images in the dialog when they appear as the dialog is scrolling. I've tried the "appear" plugin without any luck. can anyone help?
[07:56:47] <ajpiano> what do you mean, Giverny
[07:56:55] <ajpiano> .val() will only give you the value of the first input in a collection
[07:57:36] <Giverny> ajpiano i have a input with value="0blablablabla"
[07:57:44] <Giverny> i need a 0
[07:57:54] <Giverny> ajpiano understand?
[07:58:34] <ajpiano> ?eval var str = "0blablablabla";  str.charAt(0);
[07:58:35] <bot-t1> ajpiano: "0"
[07:59:18] <ajpiano> Giverny: you're looking for "the first charcter in a string" not the "first element in the value"
[07:59:21] <sphinxxx> thanks ajpiano
[07:59:23] <ajpiano> use charAt
[07:59:31] <Giverny> thank
[07:59:33] <Giverny> u
[08:05:45] <sphinxxx> ajpiano, console gave me "select option has no method 'filter'"
[08:05:52] <ajpiano> wat
[08:06:04] <ajpiano> did you actually make a jQuery selection
[08:06:14] <ajpiano> or did you do var foo = "select option" instead of $("select option")
[08:06:21] <sphinxxx> i have $st.filter(":selected").text()
[08:06:32] <amaroks> Hello Guys , I have a simple slideshow  here (2 images) the second round of transmission is not done properly , only the first transmission , any idea? http://thexlo.com/gentletouch/facebookapp/
[08:06:35] <sphinxxx> and $st = $('#div select option')
[08:07:03] <ajpiano> well that simply doesn't make sense sphinxxx, plase make a fiddle illustrating that it doesn'tw ork
[08:07:09] <alessioalex> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/fCuug/
[08:07:21] <alessioalex> when you add new elements with that class
[08:07:27] <alessioalex> hover doesn't 'bind' to them
[08:07:31] <alessioalex> even if it's declared with on
[08:07:33] <alessioalex> that's my problem
[08:07:45] <ajpiano> this fiddle has no code in it alessioalex
[08:07:52] <alessioalex> oh wait
[08:08:00] <alessioalex> http://jsfiddle.net/fCuug/1/
[08:08:03] <alessioalex> sorry, try now
[08:08:19] <sphinxxx> ajpiano, you were right, i was missing a $ lol
[08:08:52] <ajpiano> alessioalex: did you actually read the docs for understanding, or did you merely look at the words and then go about your day
[08:09:51] <ajpiano> alessioalex: the replacement for $(".foo").live("click", fn) is *NOT* $(".foo").on("click", fn), it's $(document).on("click", ".foo", fn);
[08:10:10] <alessioalex> thank you
[08:10:39] <ajpiano> third time's the charm i guess

[08:26:42] <Pilate> sly007: its programmed behavior in the getjson function
[08:27:23] <ajpiano> carlprit: did you look at the fiddle example?
[08:27:37] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pMZge/
[08:27:39] <carlprit> ajpiano: Yes, Let me show u some code
[08:28:22] <carlprit> ajpiano: I copied this; https://pastee.org/dg5f8 and put in my file
[08:28:43] <carlprit> Doesnt rly look as good at jsfiggle
[08:28:44] <ajpiano> whaaatt
[08:28:46] <carlprit> fiddle*
[08:28:48] <sly007> Pilate: well the doc could say so then :-)
[08:28:55] <ajpiano> why would you copy the *output* of the plugin having been run
[08:29:00] <carlprit> Yea
[08:29:11] <ajpiano> i asked *why*, not "did you"
[08:29:22] <carlprit> That's what Im wondering as well
[08:29:32] <carlprit> Cuz I cant find any other code to use
[08:29:33] <carlprit> :<
[08:29:43] <ajpiano> ... did you look at the fiddle example,
[08:29:59] <carlprit> Yes
[08:30:08] <carlprit> I currently am
[08:30:22] <ajpiano> carlprit: here is a much more stripped down example http://jsfiddle.net/pMZge/144/
[08:30:51] <carlprit> Yea alright
[08:30:54] <ajpiano> carlprit: you put <pre><code class="language-whatever"> around your code and then call $("pre").vanGogh() or whatever
[08:31:08] <carlprit> ajpiano: Okay, thanks
[08:36:36] <nicholasschulz> how do i convert PHP into a javascript var? i tried this: var uniqueid = <? echo uniqid(); ?>; but it didn't work.
[08:40:54] <hubbl3> nicholasschulz: It should echo a uniqid() and since we expect a string output It should be var uniqueid = "<?php echo uniqid(); ?>";
[08:41:21] <nicholasschulz> ah ok, ill try that :-) thanks a lot!
[08:42:30] <hubbl3> np :)
[08:53:54] <nicholasschulz> how do i set a interval on a function? i have this function called "check_availability()" and i want it to run every 2 seconds until i tell it to stop running
[08:54:48] <Pilate> var myinterval = setInterval(check_availability, 2000)
[08:55:15] <Shagshag> Hi
[08:56:06] <Shagshag> I have a strange issue with .load() maybe you can help ?
[08:56:29] <tziOm> When I load some javascript libs, I get an error: $(document).ready is not a function
[08:56:46] <Umren> hi, is it possible to jump not over next() element in dom, but in element after it?
[08:56:55] <tziOm> Is it possible to redefine $ to jquery in some way? or figure out what is actually messing this up?
[08:56:58] <Umren> something like .next().next() (not working)
[08:57:03] <Umren> or .next(2)
[08:57:06] <Pilate> tziOm: noConflict
[08:57:35] <tziOm> Pilate: ok..? can you please explain more?
[08:57:48] <ravenzz> ?noConflict @ tziOm
[08:57:48] <bot-t1> tziOm, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:58:10] <Pilate> ty raven
[08:58:39] <hubbl3> ?ask
[08:58:40] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:58:54] <hubbl3> ok bot
[08:59:03] <ravenzz> var foo = jQuery.noConflict(); foo('#bar').text('bar'); or (function(foo){ foo('#bar').text('bar'); })(jQuery);
[09:00:26] <Shagshag> so my issue : I have have a script that generate content using cookie. if I open the script in the browser I have a content but if I use ?load() I have an other
[09:00:27] <bot-t1> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[09:00:48] <Shagshag> oops
[09:02:17] <Shagshag> and I can't understand why, opening an url by hand or by javascript is the same for cookies no ?
[09:02:27] <ravenzz> demo?
[09:03:35] <Shagshag> @ravenzz : 1 : go to http://demo1.samdha.net/fr/2-chaussettes and add a product to the cart
[09:04:12] <Shagshag> 2 : go to http://p2w.samdha.net/ your cart should appears with the product
[09:04:30] <Shagshag> on the column
[09:05:23] <ravenzz> they are on 2 different domains
[09:06:28] <Shagshag> if flash is enable on your browser, the cart content will be god because it use flash to retreive the data, if it is not enabled, jquery will be used and the cart will appears empty
[09:07:15] <Shagshag> yes, 2 subdomains with cookie sharring and  Access-Control-Allow-Origin set
[09:08:01] <tziOm> ravenzz: when I do $.noconflict is says $ not defined
[09:08:40] <Pilate> $ never existed in the first place, why would it?
[09:08:42] <Shagshag> by the way if cross domain restriction was set, no content should appears
[09:08:43] <ravenzz> Shagshag it is not a quick fix, actually I am quite busy sorry
[09:09:03] <Shagshag> ok thanks anyway :)
[09:09:24] <Shagshag> someone else have an idea ?
[09:09:46] <ravenzz> tziOm are you trying to do this (function($) { $('#foo').text('foo'); })(jQuery); ?
[09:09:48] <tziOm> it worked nice before some plugin loaded other js.
[09:10:17] <tziOm> the theme is doing:
[09:10:18] <tziOm> $(document).ready(function(){
[09:10:18] <tziOm>         showPage($disableEffects, $topNotePause, "$skin_dir");
[09:10:18] <tziOm> });
[09:10:33] <ravenzz> bbl
[09:10:44] <tziOm> this worked nicely until some other plugin loaded javascript_libs..
[09:16:37] <hubbl3> tzi0m: do a var jq = jQuery.noConflict() then replace <em>ALL</em>$ with jq
[09:17:28] <hubbl3> Well not all, only the jQuery $
[09:20:56] <tziOm> hmm..
[09:21:27] <tziOm> so in my script, above $(document).ready, jq= jQuery.noConflict() ?
[09:21:37] <tziOm> where do I get the output?
[09:24:01] <ravenzz> tziOm (function($){ /* put the whole code here */ })(jQuery);
[09:24:27] <tziOm> but Id rather fix the lib I added than the rest of the code..
[09:25:40] <ravenzz> which lib are you talking about?
[09:25:43] <tash> i'm still learning the ropes of jq here ... I have a select box in a form and when a user selects one of the options, I'd like to programmatically create another <select> just below it.  So, I guess a <div> under the original <select> and then something like an onchange event or something?
[09:25:55] <tash> I can definitely share some code if it helps.
[09:26:10] <ravenzz> ?change @ tash
[09:26:11] <bot-t1> tash, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:26:27] <ravenzz> ?after @ tash
[09:26:27] <bot-t1> tash, .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[09:26:33] <tziOm> ravenzz: its a addon to squirrelmail, javascript_libs
[09:26:49] <ravenzz> dunno man, I gave you the solution
[09:27:08] <ravenzz> also hubbl3 did
[09:33:06] <billwalton> why does this.forms[0] not work when document.forms[0] works and this is the document?
[09:33:12] <tziOm> ravenzz: Do I need to put every function into (function($){ ... })(jQuery) ?
[09:33:30] <billwalton> http://jsfiddle.net/yXBzc/
[09:33:51] <billwalton> line 16
[09:34:13] <billwalton> i have to use this.context.forms[0] or i get an exception
[09:34:30] <ngharo> empty fiddle bro
[09:34:40] <billwalton> hmmm
[09:34:54] <Pilate> Accessing form elements via JavaScript: Don't use document.formName.elementName. Use document.forms['formName'].elements['elementName'] or getElementById() or getElementsByName() instead.
[09:35:19] <tziOm> ravenzz: here is the code I need inside function($) or whatever.. http://pastebin.com/CA57YWqU
[09:35:40] <Pilate> lol, nobody is going through that shit tz
[09:35:58] <jimmyrcom> is this correct?  selector1 + selector2 = selector1+selector2
[09:36:10] <jimmyrcom> same for ~ and >?
[09:37:02] <tash> ravenzz: shouldn't this alert me when I change the select with id of 'occurrence' ?
[09:37:05] <tash> http://pastie.org/3097000
[09:37:10] <ravenzz> tziOm yes it should work
[09:37:34] <tziOm> then it complaints it cant find showPage function
[09:38:21] <tziOm> and if I dont do it, it complaints: $("#plugins a") is nullÂ 
[09:38:24] <sphinxxx> what is wrong with this line?  $("button").on("click", function(e) {
[09:39:18] <jastor> sphinxxx, .bind
[09:39:20] <ravenzz> tash yes
[09:39:44] <ravenzz> tash http://jsfiddle.net/9epgV/
[09:40:25] <sphinxxx> jastor, i have buttons created after the DOM is loaded, will .bind still work on all of them?
[09:40:51] <jastor> sphinxxx, youd need to rebind
[09:41:23] <sphinxxx> i thought this is the whole purpose of .on
[09:41:33] <ajpiano> sphinxxx: if you want to use .on like .live you have to do $(document).on("click", "button", fn);
[09:42:20] <sphinxxx> ah
[09:42:49] <sphinxxx> thx that works
[09:43:36] <jimmyrcom> does whitespace matter with ">,~,+" selectors?
[09:43:49] <jimmyrcom> prev+next=prev + next?

[10:06:48] <amaroks> hubbl3 its not :(
[10:09:01] <talntid> $50-100 via paypal for anyone who assists me with a javascript "project" I am working on. I am not sure how to go about it, and it is mildly complex I think. It's live updating of forms from information retrieved from a PHP file...
[10:09:15] <ravenzz> #css-lance
[10:14:19] <tlk> The demo code (view source) on http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu has a reference to http://view.jqueryui.com/menu/themes/base/jquery.ui.menu.css and http://view.jqueryui.com/menu/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[10:14:24] <tlk> both return 404
[10:14:43] <tlk> what is the correct URL?
[10:15:04] <tgodar> think jquery UI burned to death recently
[10:15:06] <ajpiano> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[10:15:06] <tlk> and who would be interested in an heads up on that issue?
[10:15:21] <ajpiano> tlk: the docs you found aren't public, they are only staged in mediawiki for convenience
[10:15:37] <ajpiano> as UI meni is not actually released
[10:17:18] <tlk> ajpiano: oh, I didn't realize it wasn't released yet
[10:18:27] <tlk> ajpiano: thanks
[10:18:55] <ajpiano> no prob
[10:38:57] <supsup> ajpiano any news on the next yahquery podcast ~
[10:39:10] <ajpiano> no

[10:52:01] <nicholasschulz> Is it possible to do this in a way: var samovar = .load('some-page.ext'); ?
[10:55:17] <tgodar> nicholasschulz: what are you trying to do?
[10:55:50] <nicholasschulz> I'm trying to get var somevar = 1 or 0, depending on the results the PHP give
[10:56:43] <nicholasschulz> if somevar = 1 it means the user account is activated , if = 0 means its not activated.
[10:56:50] <Mkop> I'm trying to make an element flash (alternate having vs. not having a class with a background-color)
[10:57:09] <Mkop> having trouble thinking through how to do it right
[10:57:16] <morficus> !log
[10:57:22] <Mkop> hmm, maybe I should just jsfiddle it....
[10:57:23] <morficus> hm.
[10:57:27] <tgodar> <blink> lol
[10:57:33] <Mkop> ?log
[10:57:34] <bot-t1> big, heavy, also wood. http://bit.ly/2mr1xK
[10:57:49] <tgodar> < whoops wrong channel
[11:01:41] <Mkop> nicholasschulz: why don't you make the PHP return JSON?
[11:01:48] <Mkop> that is a better way to do things
[11:02:21] <supsup> amaroks:  $active.next().length is always 0.
[11:02:30] <nicholasschulz> well I'm kinda new to jquery and don't know 1% of what I can do with it yet
[11:02:59] <nicholasschulz> but thanks for the tip :-) ill check into it
[11:03:20] <supsup> o wait ... maybe not hah sorry
[11:04:23] <supsup> nm yah its always 0.  i think anyway here u can check via console. http://jsfiddle.net/9tFvB/
[11:24:04] <sphinxxx> can a normal site be built with jquery mobile? or is it a better idea to have it as a separate mobile site
[11:38:37] <kkuno> hi I'm trying to load some content and showing it with animation
[11:39:09] <kkuno> the problem is that all content is loaded at the same time (ajax)
[11:39:38] <kkuno> the result is that the animations are not fluid
[11:39:59] <kkuno> someone has any suggestions?
[11:40:09] <kkuno> I'll trying to serialize all content loading
[11:40:25] <kkuno> so only 1 animation at a time can happen
[11:40:56] <tgodar> make one ajax call with data in separate elements - less load on server too
[11:42:01] <tgodar> oh, you mean you fire off the three animation calls one after another say, and the animation then does not look fluid?
[11:43:50] <chovy> kkuno: you can call .stop() to stop a current animation.
[11:45:28] <kkuno> tgodar, yeah, the latter
[11:46:08] <tgodar> kkuno: I am surprised that it would not look fluid calling one right after another
[11:50:36] <chovy> kkuno: can you put up a jsfiddle?
[11:50:42] <Andreas2k4> how to get the sum of height of a jquery collection? heigh() only returns the height of the first element..
[11:51:05] <chovy> you shouldn't start an animation until the previous one completes. But animations have a callback function for that, so you can nest them.
[11:51:07] <sphinxxx> .each loop through the collection, add each height to a counter
[11:52:43] <Andreas2k4> any way to avoid the additional variable?
[11:53:47] <kkuno> chovy, yeah one solution is to "serialize" all animations
[11:54:01] <kkuno> I don't know if it'll be too slow

[11:55:05] <jwmann> Can jQuery animate background rgba?
[11:55:33] <k_89> jwmann, there must be a plugin for that
[11:55:44] <jwmann> You can't do it by default?
[11:56:12] <jwmann> Like- "background" : "rgba(255,255,255,0.9)";
[11:56:16] <Alesko_> hello
[11:56:51] <k_89> jwmann, i tried animating background-position once
[11:56:51] <Alesko_> i would like to do a specific action on a specific option selected in a select box
[11:56:56] <k_89> and no it didn't work
[11:57:01] <k_89> there is a pllugin for that
[11:57:03] <jwmann> ugh
[11:58:58] <joerg> hi
[12:02:26] <joerg> I have worked with jquery for yeras and never had any problems....but now it drives me crazy: I have a function that programmatically generates a <li> element and sets an attribute to a child: li.find("a.install-button").attr("name", "foo").
[12:02:52] <joerg> now when I try to get $(this).attr("name") in my onClick handler, it gives me undefined.
[12:04:31] <tgodar> version of jQuery?
[12:05:31] <tgodar> thinking change of prop/attr or something?   but doubt it... Something like a typo or something goofy?
[12:06:23] <Dunstkreis> joerg: did you check if the argument appears in the html code? with firebug or something?
[12:07:25] <Dunstkreis> To isolate the source of error
[12:08:49] <tgodar> mixing up the li for something in the li?
[12:10:05] <BinaryKitten> ?peace @ joerg
[12:10:06] <bot-t1> joerg, please Pastebin: Expected result, Actual result, all (relevant) Code, any Errors/Exceptions - This is *not* a multiple-choice request, we need all of them

[12:11:36] <saba> What do you guys believe is the fastest method for swapping contents (fairly large content) of divs? doing .hide() on old divs, .append() new divs (sharing CSS), then doing .remove() on old content? Or simply doing $(old).html(new)?
[12:11:39] <LordThumper> this?
[12:11:44] <sphinxxx> not too sure how best to describe this,  i want a div to dissapear, but when it happens i need a puff of smoke animation, or some kind of animation, how would i best do this?
[12:11:50] <LordThumper> joerg: Try event.target
[12:11:54] <saba> problem with the last one is that the new var contains all divs, thus you have to split them when doing .html ()
[12:12:23] <LordThumper> Then search the DOM from there
[12:13:08] <joerg> http://pastebin.com/h1qzGjVD
[12:13:12] <joerg> there you go ;)
[12:13:36] <joerg> I first tried the data() function which didn't really work
[12:13:44] <joerg> then I tried to set the stuff through the name attribute
[12:13:48] <Dunstkreis> .live?? :)
[12:13:57] <joerg> yes...
[12:14:07] <LordThumper> joerg: I am new to jquery myself... try event.target instead of this
[12:14:10] <joerg> makes a lot of sense when you add new elements of that type to the DOM
[12:14:20] <joerg> Dunstkreis, .click won't find them
[12:14:23] <LordThumper> That is what I use anyways
[12:14:51] <Dunstkreis> .click wont find them? .click adds a handler, there shouldnt be anything to "find" !?
[12:15:16] <joerg> Dunstkreis, as I said, these links are generated progammatically and added to the DOM later.
[12:15:19] <LordThumper> No .click won't work for dynamically created elements
[12:15:23] <Dunstkreis> ah
[12:15:30] <Dunstkreis> okay got it. :)
[12:15:30] <Dunstkreis> sry
[12:15:36] <joerg> $(".foo").click() binds to all .foo elements currently in the DOM
[12:15:43] <joerg> but not to those that I might add in the future
[12:15:48] <LordThumper> joerg: Did you try event.target?
[12:15:58] <joerg> no, I am not good at multi tasking
[12:16:02] <joerg> wait a second :)
[12:16:24] <systemfault> jQuery abstractions are good but they mess up people...
[12:16:26] <LordThumper> lol stop coding on your Mac Book ;p
[12:16:27] <BinaryKitten> joeg .. what is .render ?
[12:16:38] <systemfault> It's always a matter of event handling vs event delegation...
[12:16:53] <systemfault> Not "for elements added in the future"
[12:17:23] <Dunstkreis> keep on, systemfault that sounds interessting. :)
[12:17:36] <systemfault> Dunstkreis: Ok..
[12:17:59] <sphinxxx> joerg, .on
[12:18:01] <systemfault> Standard event handling is when you attach an handler to specifically chosen nodes...
[12:18:06] <sphinxxx> you ened jquery 1.7.1 for it
[12:18:37] <BinaryKitten> joeg can you provide a fiddle please?   so we can see the html as well?
[12:18:54] <systemfault> event delegation is when you attach an handler to a parent of a set of elements... and is triggered because of an effect called bubbling.
[12:19:06] <BinaryKitten> had to see where the elements are coming from without it, also what is .render() coming from?
[12:19:12] <Dunstkreis> bubbling, heared of it...
[12:20:18] <joerg> BinaryKitten, .render belongs to the pure template library ;)
[12:20:22] <joerg> hey guys, thanks a lot
[12:20:25] <joerg> the problem is solved :)
[12:20:30] <BinaryKitten> lol
[12:20:32] <LordThumper> event.target?
[12:20:33] <joerg> and you can savely use $(this) btw.
[12:20:36] <joerg> nope
[12:20:37] <joerg> typo
[12:20:40] <LordThumper> lol
[12:20:50] <LordThumper> nice
[12:20:53] <joerg> app.name was undefined ;)
[12:20:55] <BinaryKitten> joerg there are a few improvements you can make to that code
[12:21:16] <joerg> because the function that set it set app.namee = "foo"
[12:21:31] <joerg> BinaryKitten, I am open for your suggestions ^^
[12:21:39] <sphinxxx> anyone know of a sprite of a puff of a smoke?
[12:21:42] <sphinxxx> dont feel like making one :\
[12:21:54] <BinaryKitten> i'm going to update the pastebin for you joerg give me a few minutes ok?
[12:22:07] <nicholasschulz> how do i get a var to be valid in $.get ?
[12:22:54] <systemfault> nicholasschulz: What do you mean?
[12:23:00] <nicholasschulz> $.get("testdrive.php?action=checkActivation&uniqid=uniqid", function(data){
[12:23:01] <systemfault> nicholasschulz: What is the problem you have?
[12:23:17] <nicholasschulz> take a look at the last uniqid. it is a var, but doesn't show as a var when passed
[12:23:30] <systemfault> nicholasschulz: Sure.. just append it with +
[12:23:43] <systemfault> $.get("testdrive.php?action=checkActivation&uniqid=" + uniqid, function(data){
[12:23:46] <nicholasschulz> uniqid=+uniqid+" ?
[12:23:55] <systemfault> Nah, just a +
[12:23:55] <nicholasschulz> ah, ok
[12:23:56] <nicholasschulz> thanks
[12:24:01] <systemfault> You're welcome
[12:25:31] <Alesko_> please
[12:26:02] <Alesko_> how can i do a specific action on a specific option selected with a class in a select ?
[12:26:25] <Alesko_> i would like to make appear some div when a select a specific option in a select
[12:27:07] <systemfault> Alesko_: Perhaps on "change" with the select
[12:29:27] <Alesko_> hum
[12:29:27] <Alesko_> ok
[12:32:13] <joerg> hmmm
[12:32:30] <joerg> now the .attr stuff works.... but are there browsers which don't support .data()?
[12:32:45] <joerg> I am on webkit.... (Qt's QWebView)
[12:35:39] <BinaryKitten> joerg still here?
[12:35:57] <BinaryKitten> joerg all browsers support the .data
[12:36:19] <BinaryKitten> it's not html5 data (though retreival supports html5 data)
[12:37:15] <Alesko_> systemfault,
[12:37:18] <Alesko_> i tried this
[12:37:19] <Alesko_> $("#input-1-select_1").change(function(){
[12:37:19] <Alesko_> 			if ($(this).children('.select_1_1:selected')){
[12:37:19] <Alesko_> 				alert('ok');

[12:37:25] <Alesko_> oops fllod
[12:37:27] <Alesko_> flood sorry
[12:37:34] <systemfault> Yeah.. use a pastebin for that.

[12:39:56] <Alesko_> here systemfault : http://jsfiddle.net/3vpkC/
[12:40:08] <BinaryKitten> snoops jsfiddle & jsbin give you options to put both in the same link... my machine is running real slow.. be right there
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis> if i do $.ajax or $.get on an URL with i know from observing with tamper data or likewise addons, first gives a 302 (or 301) HTTP Status Code, and then the browser opens the given url, and finaly a 200 status code is given back, all i can fetch in jQuery seems to be the 200 Code!?
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis> does someone knows a workaround? i tried .get and some stuff on jqXHR.status and so on, and i finaly changed the code to
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis> $.ajax({
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis>     url: zielUrl,
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis>     success: function(data){...some things to do ...},
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis>     statusCode: {
[12:41:27] <Dunstkreis>         302: function() { alert("AA");},
[12:41:28] <Dunstkreis>         301: function() { alert("BB");},
[12:41:28] <Dunstkreis>         200: function() { alert("CC");}   } });
[12:41:29] <Dunstkreis> and all i get is AA !?
[12:41:43] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis do not paste ... use a pastebin
[12:41:47] <BinaryKitten> ?paste @ Dunstkreis
[12:41:48] <bot-t1> Dunstkreis, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:41:49] <Dunstkreis> sry, :)
[12:43:03] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis 200 = OK which should fire the success callback
[12:43:05] <Dunstkreis> so the question remains the same, why do i only get the AA on this code? -> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/527896/
[12:43:12] <Dunstkreis> it does
[12:43:20] <BinaryKitten> so that eliminates the CC
[12:43:35] <BinaryKitten> are you sure it's giving back  the right codes?
[12:43:39] <Dunstkreis> but i know - cos of tamper data and likewise addons, that there is a 302 before 200
[12:43:52] <BinaryKitten> yes, but the browser handles that right?
[12:44:03] <Dunstkreis> i am, im using php header stuff setting those headers...
[12:44:15] <BinaryKitten> have a look at the data returned
[12:44:23] <BinaryKitten> see if it's from the redirected url.
[12:44:34] <Dunstkreis> that could belong to my question. The browser does a redirect and opens the new within the 302 status code header given URL...
[12:44:44] <Snooops> BinaryKitten, yeah its better :D
[12:45:19] <Dunstkreis> it its from the final url, the redirecting one has a die(); in the php code after the header('Location: ./....'); stuff ...
[12:45:51] <Dunstkreis> so the data is from the "new" url, and this does - like desigend - reply with a 200 status code.
[12:47:03] <Dunstkreis> to me it seams that the browser does handle this 302 rewrite status code things and only returns the "final" data and codes to the JS Engine... Is this so? does somebody knows around here?
[12:50:50] <Dunstkreis> gosh, damn, i was writing bullshit :D sry, i DONT get the AA thing, only the CC Thing!!! :D -> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/527896/
[12:51:06] <Dunstkreis> but i would like to catch the AA thing and do things there...
[12:51:12] <Dunstkreis> sorry for confusing...
[12:51:32] <BinaryKitten> joerg ... ping
[12:52:36] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis  are you sure you're returning the code?  sorry but i've seen it done before where someone returns a "location" header but not the status code
[12:52:51] <BinaryKitten> most browsers are smart enough to redirect with a location.
[12:52:56] <BinaryKitten> *with just a location
[12:53:45] <BinaryKitten> joerg  does that make sense to you? the changes i made i mean?
[12:55:21] <Dunstkreis> i tried header('Location: ./aktuelles-kurse',true,301); and header('Location: ./aktuelles-kurse'); where the secound should return 302 ... nothing worked...
[12:55:34] <Dunstkreis> both of them followed by die();
[12:56:10] <BinaryKitten> 2nd won't return 302
[12:56:18] <BinaryKitten> a location header doesn't set the code
[12:56:22] <BinaryKitten> you have to do that manually
[12:56:51] <standoo> is there a place to showcase my jquery based web apps?
[12:57:31] <joerg> BinaryKitten,thanks a lot...wait
[12:57:32] <Dunstkreis> it does, so the php manuel sais: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[12:57:36] <BinaryKitten> on your site standoo?
[12:57:51] <joerg> BinaryKitten, this weird stuff here stopped working again
[12:58:27] <BinaryKitten> :(
[12:58:33] <Dunstkreis> but u are right, only the location header in HTTP Terms is not equal to the 302 status code, but PHP does so, and sets this code. and i veryfied that with the help of tamderdata / HTTP Header Addon on firefox...
[12:58:47] <BinaryKitten> Dunstkreis php doesn't do so
[12:59:03] <BinaryKitten> not unless you tell it to
[13:00:14] <Dunstkreis> :) mystery my addons say tho, the wireshark does tell me, but doesnt matter, for me it does, but that not the question around here, cos like i said the other example, with the ,true ,301); at the end of line, DOES return 301 status code - agreed?
[13:00:33] <Dunstkreis> And i cant catch this 301 within jQuery .ajax :status thing...
[13:01:03] <BinaryKitten> should do
[13:01:19] <BinaryKitten> but then again, redirections are handled before hand
[13:01:45] <BinaryKitten> xmlhttprequest, i believe, handles them before resoultion
[13:01:54] <BinaryKitten> like a standard browser load
[13:01:59] <joerg> BinaryKitten, unbelievable!
[13:02:14] <joerg> you know what messed up my attrs and the .data() stuff? the pure template library
[13:02:21] <BinaryKitten> heh
[13:02:23] <joerg> if I comment out the .render call, everything wirks
[13:02:42] <BinaryKitten> do the changes make sense?
[13:02:44] <joerg> any recommendations for a template library that just works?
[13:02:55] <Hornet> what's the preferred pattern to having an html box pop up and binding events to it?  remove from dom and recreate/rebind each time?
[13:03:01] <BinaryKitten> joerg what are you trying to do with the template stuff?
[13:03:32] <BinaryKitten> gah.. sorry is that the time?
[13:03:38] * BinaryKitten has to run.. sorry joerg
[13:03:45] <Dunstkreis> ah, okay, that could be a hint,
[13:03:49] <Dunstkreis> ty BinaryKitten
[13:04:04] <sphinxxx> are there any good magnifying glass plugins? that will work on not just images but text as well
[13:04:05] <joerg> BinaryKitten, then go and run ;) see you later and thanks so far
[13:04:11] <BinaryKitten> no probs
[13:04:11] <joerg> BinaryKitten, your code looks good
[13:04:18] <joerg> even though I am not sure if its necessary
[13:04:24] <joerg> the addTo element is hidden
[13:04:25] <Dunstkreis> but u should have a look to this site, if you find the time: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php : The second special case is the "Location:" header. Not only does it send this header back to the browser, but it also returns a REDIRECT (302) status code to the browser unless the 201 or a 3xx status code has already been set.
[13:04:28] <Dunstkreis> just to say ;)
[13:04:35] <joerg> and shown after the render function has finished
[13:04:36] <BinaryKitten> joerg still triggers a dom update
[13:04:48] <joerg> hmm,ok
[13:04:48] <BinaryKitten> even if it doesn't trigger a re-rendder
[13:04:55] <joerg> if that matters ;)
[13:04:58] <BinaryKitten> that's how live and delegate link
[13:05:10] <nicholasschulz> I finished my registration form (except the validation of fields)!! Please take a look and let me know what you think :-)!

[13:31:30] <brodoser> will setting a checkbox to checkbox.attr('checked','checked') fire the same event as checkbox.click()?
[13:31:47] <solidus-lake> hey, i'm confused about how we are supposed to namespace the $(function() {...}); functionality of jquery
[13:33:32] <safani> Hey all, happy holidays!
[13:34:11] <safani> I have a question I have not been able to find the answer to.  I'm building a small program at work using jquery
[13:34:35] <safani> I am using animation through slideUp and slideDown
[13:34:44] <Dunstkreis> brodoser: i dont know, but would be suppriesed. with attr you should only set the attribute, like you could do in the HTML Code, so there isnt fired any click event at page load, if a checkbox is allready set, is it?
[13:35:15] <safani> but when i scroll over my content and it scrolls down many other scrolls continue after from the queue
[13:35:17] <brodoser> Dunstkreis: i'll investigate further and see what the deal is
[13:35:26] <timing> Hi all!
[13:35:32] <Dunstkreis> would be nice to hear from you, brodoser
[13:35:42] <safani> I would like the animation queue to stop whenever I mouseover one of the divs the slides down
[13:35:56] <safani> using the stop() method has not worked properly so far
[13:35:57] <timing> I use a data-fro attribute in my elements, and with jquery I can fetch the value with data('from');
[13:36:04] <timing> I can also change it with data('from');
[13:36:30] <timing> is there a way to select that attribute based on the data value? even after I changed it with data?
[13:36:47] <Dunstkreis> safani: did you try fiddling around with http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/ ?
[13:37:15] <safani> i did
[13:37:16] <timing> e.g.: $el.data('from', 1234); $parent.find('[data-from=1234]'); won't work
[13:37:27] <safani> i got some weird results
[13:37:59] <safani> it didnt work like how I was expecting
[13:38:28] <safani> I have a table of information that on mouse enter a hidden div will slide down
[13:38:49] <safani> this code is copied over and over, with different ids of course and it works
[13:39:07] <solidus-lake> if i put a $(function()) in a namespace will it still run on load?
[13:39:17] <safani> its just that when i swipe the mouse over the entire screen twice the animations wherever they are triggered play 2 or 3 times
[13:39:19] <frenocha> is it common to have peculiar results on ipads/iphones on jquery-powered websites?
[13:39:22] <solidus-lake> or do i need to keep any onload functionality out of custom namespaces
[13:43:07] <Dunstkreis> safain, any examples?
[13:44:24] <safani> www.janilink.com/designertest.php
[13:44:43] <Dunstkreis> timing, i didnt know, that one can select throug values of data fields?!
[13:45:29] <safani> if you go there you will see that the app works...its just annoying because it moves over and over, I change sliding from slow to fast
[13:45:39] <safani> and it helped a bit but its still ..buggy
[13:46:00] <Dunstkreis> i dont know where the bug is!? :) its moving, okay.
[13:46:20] <safani> it is!
[13:46:20] <Dunstkreis> on mouse over its "opening" to the south and closing on mouse leave ...
[13:46:26] <safani> i know
[13:46:31] <Dunstkreis> ahhh
[13:46:42] <safani> but I want it to stop other animations immediately
[13:46:53] <Dunstkreis> if i strafe fast enough...
[13:47:09] <safani> yea see i put it on fast and it helped a bit
[13:47:11] <Dunstkreis> btw: this could be done in CSS ;)
[13:48:02] <safani> your right lol maybe i should have gone that route
[13:48:15] <iceman111_E_15> aa
[13:48:32] <Dunstkreis> but thats not the point ;) lets see if we can fix it! :)
[13:50:16] <Dunstkreis> safani: first see this link: http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[13:50:24] <Dunstkreis> have a look at the last demo.
[13:50:49] <Dunstkreis> mouseover could be fired several times...
[13:51:15] <Dunstkreis> so using mouseenter is safer...
[13:51:53] <Krinkle> But then if one quickly enters , leaves and enters again, it would still double fire
[13:52:04] <Dunstkreis> yea
[13:52:10] <Krinkle> safani: to stop an animation and reset the state, call .stop(true, true) before doing your slide
[13:52:19] <Krinkle> ?stop
[13:52:19] <bot-t1> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[13:52:30] <safani> omg ! seriously!
[13:52:49] <Dunstkreis> nice :)
[13:53:04] <safani> i see mouseenter is safer i saw that demo several times but didn't get what they were trying to say there.
[13:53:09] <Dunstkreis> jump to the end, is a very good idea! :D
[13:53:38] <Dunstkreis> but you got it now, safani? :)
[13:54:39] <safani> yea i think ill figure it out now.
[13:55:17] <safani> i knew it had to be stop or clearqueue but it just wasnt working for me, i understand a lot better thank you for your help
[13:58:17] <safani> is there a way to say "do not fire event unless the mouse has entered for a certain amount of time"
[13:59:22] <Dunstkreis> hmmm.
[13:59:36] <Dunstkreis> setTimeout and clear timeout!?
[13:59:41] <Dunstkreis> thats simple JS.
[13:59:57] <ajpiano> ?fix hover @ safani
[13:59:57] <bot-t1> safani, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[14:00:52] <Dunstkreis> you could set a timer, for a few ms, and on leaving just clear this timer if its not over and started the animation queue
[14:02:09] <safani> i just started really digging into js im more into php
[14:02:12] <Dunstkreis> hover. hoverIntent sounds interessting, thank you, ajpiano !
[14:02:17] <safani> but its a lot more fun
[14:03:14] <safani> Hoverintent is niiiceee
[14:03:47] <safani> ill definitely be back to parle with you guys. Thanks again!
[14:11:16] <z0ned> anyone know of any good geocoding plugins?
[14:20:06] <cybersholt> anybody know why i get an error when trying to set a cookie for jq ui tabs ?
[14:22:23] <cybersholt> guess its dead in here
[14:34:39] <iceman111_E_15> Anyone her?
[14:37:08] <cybersholt> not really
[14:40:32] <ngharo> it would be helpful if you mentioned the error..
[14:41:20] <z0ned> anyone know of any good geocoding plugins?
[14:43:28] <cybersholt> @ngharo i gave up on it anyways not a big deal got alot of other stuff to do
[14:49:16] <timwis> Hey guys, trying to figure out the best way to do this: I have a table and I want some of the rows collapsible. It looks like this: http://codepad.org/Pls4vVRs -- I'd like the regular lines to be hidden by default, and when you click the Header for them, they're visible. I know how I'd do this if the lines were children of the header element, but they're not. What's the best way to do this?
[14:49:44] <timwis> I figure I could give them all the same id attribute and query them that way..?
[14:50:13] <timwis> although having multiple elements with the same id is anti w3c i think
[14:53:18] <thoughtsand> how do I use jQuery UI's hide() with fadeOut() simultaneously? $('#notice').hide('blind').fadeOut() works consecutively.
[15:00:18] <innociv> thoughtsand, fadeOut() automatically does display:none at the end
[15:01:06] <thoughtsand> innociv: it makes all the elements below it jump up after it fades out, and I want it to slide up gradually. so I'm using hide('blind').
[15:02:19] <innociv> what is 'blind'?
[15:02:49] <innociv> http://api.jquery.com/hide/ I see nothing in the docs about that argument
[15:04:43] <nicholasschulz> slide up gradually can be done with slideUp ?
[15:11:50] <poppiez> I've a dialog with a fixed height of 300px and overflow: auto; I want to lazyload the images inside. I'm using the appear plugin that lets me know if an element appears when scrolling but it doesn't work inside dialogs
[15:12:04] <poppiez> any way to do this?
[15:13:01] <thoughtsand> innociv: which is why i'm using jQuery UI.
[15:13:13] <innociv> Oh
[15:13:22] <thoughtsand> innociv: i think it behaves differently. :(
[15:13:24] <innociv> There might be a callback.
[15:13:31] <innociv> For when it finished.
[15:13:33] <innociv> finishes*
[15:13:34] <thoughtsand> would there be a before_animation callback?
[15:13:42] <thoughtsand> ah. but by then it's too late because it's disappeared.
[15:13:57] <thoughtsand> wow i totally made up "before_animation" with the underscore there.
[15:14:33] <innociv> You want them to happen at the same time?  $(selector).hide('blind'); $(selector).fadeOut();
[15:16:25] <thoughtsand> i thought i tried that and it didn't work! hm. will try again, and if it doesn't work, i'll also try slideUp.
[15:16:28] <thoughtsand> thanks!
[15:16:51] <innociv> It should work.  The next line shouldn't wait for the other to finish before it executes with things like that.
[15:16:55] <innociv> Animations should be async.
[15:18:34] <innociv> If that doesn't work, you should make a jsfiddle.
[15:19:39] <z0ned> i've defined a "class" like so:  var myObj = { var1: "something", var2: function (){...}, ... }      my question is, say i want to have a "global" variable in this space (just like var1 is), but i don't know its value yet, because its value will be set by later (by the var2 function, for example) - how do i do this?
[15:20:16] <BinaryKitten> var1: null,
[15:20:29] <BinaryKitten> function can still reference and set that
[15:20:31] <z0ned> BinaryKitten, and then i can set it later by this.var1 =
[15:20:37] <BinaryKitten> yep
[15:24:58] <thoughtsand> Seems like it doesn't work. Would you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/D2Ze3/7/
[15:27:56] <t1m_> hey guys, i am using the $.ajax method and call a php function that returns a string... on success i want to display that string, but i don't know how to get to this string . this is my code: http://pastebin.com/9bKppH5n
[15:32:37] <nicholasschulz> t1m_ the string ur looking for is data (as u have written it on line 10. what is it supposed to display/contain?
[15:33:13] <t1m_> there are two div containers in it, containing an image and some text each
[15:33:23] <t1m_> just a string
[15:34:33] <nicholasschulz> and u have made sure it doesn't contain anything that disrupt the var ? like a '
[15:35:34] <t1m_> nicholasschulz: it only contains "
[15:35:56] <poppiez> I've a dialog with a fixed height of 300px and overflow: auto; I want to lazyload the images inside. I'm using the appear plugin that lets me know if an element appears when scrolling but it doesn't work inside dialogs. any way to do this?
[15:37:22] <t1m_> nicholasschulz: this is a string of that kind: <div class="inv_element" style="display:none;margin:10px;float:left;" id="0"></div><span style="position:relative;z-index:100;position:relative;top:-20px;left:3px;">15 x</span><div class="inv_element" style="display:none;margin:10px;float:left;" id="1"></div><span style="position:relative;z-index:100;position:relative;top:-20px;left:3px;">1500 x</span>
[15:38:32] <t1m_> nicholasschulz: i got it... the php function has to echo the string, a return does not work... makes sense :)
[15:38:58] <nicholasschulz> :-)
[15:59:13] <rzec> if I do put/delete as the type and I am passed data with it through the data parameters with an ajax call, how can I access that data in PHP?
[16:01:00] <nicholasschulz> show code
[16:01:48] <nicholasschulz> use either $_GET['var'] or $_POST['var'] in php to access whatever u need
[16:02:38] <rzec> nicholasschulz: js here : http://pastebin.com/KBUCiKV0
[16:02:55] <rzec> both $_GET/$_POST are empty
[16:05:01] <nicholasschulz> check line 5
[16:05:06] <nicholasschulz> change that to post
[16:05:17] <nicholasschulz> or, change PUT to POST
[16:06:08] <nicholasschulz> did that work rzec?
[16:06:24] <systemfault> rzec: Don't listen to them...
[16:06:39] <rzec> sorry, I got disconnected so I think I missed something here
[16:06:47] <systemfault> For put, you need to get the data from the input..
[16:06:52] <rzec> systemfault: what shouldn't i listen too
[16:07:16] <rzec> you mean php://input?
[16:07:21] <systemfault> Shitty advices like "use POST instead of PUT"
[16:07:24] <systemfault> Yes..
[16:07:45] <systemfault> That's the only way to get the put data in php.
[16:07:55] <rzec> oh, yea, I want to put a true rest applicat so I am going to need to use DELETE/PUT
[16:08:05] <systemfault> Cool :)
[16:08:07] <rzec> systemfault: thanks, I will have a look on that
[16:08:08] <systemfault> I love rest.
[16:08:27] <tprice> will $(window).unload work on ever browser
[16:08:35] <tprice> and will it fire every time?
[16:10:40] <rzec> systemfault: not actaully a jquery but a rest question i have always been confused about and not sure if you knwo the right answer, what is PUT for and POST for.  I keep hearing you can use either one for inserts and updates though I would think one is designed for one action and the other is designed for the other action
[16:11:42] <systemfault> rzec: Hmm, See paths as collection of objects.
[16:11:55] <systemfault> Let's say users..
[16:12:34] <systemfault> /user would be "collection" (like an array.. list.. whatever)
[16:13:10] <systemfault> Trying to GET on that would return ALL users (Depending on privileges) which is the content of the collection.
[16:13:48] <systemfault> To access a specific user, you would do: /user/12345   (12345) being the identifier of the user
[16:14:06] <rzec> yea, that part I understand
[16:14:16] <rzec> but let say I wanted to insert a user
[16:14:17] <systemfault> If you want to add a new user, you don't want/need to specify what would be the new user id so...
[16:14:29] <rzec> what http method would I user, POST or PUT
[16:14:30] <systemfault> Because it`s autogenerated or whatever...
[16:14:35] <rzec> same for updating a user
[16:14:45] <systemfault> You would use POST to add an element to a collection
[16:15:05] <systemfault> So /user with a POST would add a new user
[16:15:30] <rzec> ah, ok
[16:15:35] <systemfault> But if you wanted to update a user profile, you would do: PUT /user/12345
[16:15:53] <systemfault> And DELETE is pretty obvious...
[16:15:57] <rzec> PUT and POST always confuses me on which in meant for what
[16:16:08] <rzec> and i knever use it enough to remember
[16:16:11] <systemfault> rzec: The notion of idempotence is important.
[16:16:43] <systemfault> PUT is idempotent... POST isn't
[16:16:49] <devc> hey guys, I have an internal project here (sorry, I hate being THAT guy) that I can'r reproduce in jsfiddle. I'm trying to call $('#boom').hide("explode", { pieces: 64}, 900); which works in jsfiddle but in my project span#boom simply disappears, there's no explosion.
[16:17:30] <systemfault> Idempotent means that you can call it multiple times with the same result.
[16:17:44] <devc> The code fires, and I'm quite certain as I can be that nothing else is firing, but definitely nothing else firing on the same object.
[16:18:01] <systemfault> Using POST on a collection multiple times will always modify the collection by adding a new element.
[16:18:18] <z0ned> i have an object: var JQGC = { region: null, detect: function() { if (region === "blah") {...} }, ... }     region is undefined initially, but must be set (obviously) before calling the detect() function.    later on, i have some code that actually uses my JQGC object: JQGC.region = "us"; var detectedLoc = JQGC.detect(); .... but then this will not compile because it says "region is undefined", how do i get around this?
[16:18:34] <systemfault> (side-effect)
[16:21:38] <devc> I have no idea how/what to troubleshoot in this case
[16:22:19] <devc> Google and the support on Jqueryui's site don't seem to have anyone else with this problem which means it must be something silly I'm overlooking
[16:22:50] <z0ned> devc, if it works in jsfiddle and not in your code, then it's obviously something ELSE in your code that's wrong
[16:23:12] <z0ned> so without you showing us the rest of it, it's simply not possible for anyone to help
[16:24:27] <devc> I figured, but wanted to ask in case I was missing something and there was an obvious answer like "Well it need to be fired on a click event" or position can't be set to relative, or something.
[16:25:06] <devc> Fart balls. I appreciate reading through it. I'll see what I can do :)
[16:26:14] <z0ned> devc, if you got it working in jsfiddle, then you know everything that needs to be done to get it to work :) you could just start ripping stuff out of your code and seeing if you can isolate what's wrong
[16:27:46] <devc> It's unfortunately a humongous project at about 10,000 lines of inter-dependent code. It's simply not feasible at this point. I'll figure it out.
[16:29:41] <devc> Thanks for the help.
[16:37:25] <thoughtsand> devc: I had a problem like that, and it turned out that I was using jQuery UI and jQuery versions that were too new and not officially interoperable.
[16:37:41] <thoughtsand> or.. something. so i had to roll back a version.
[16:37:46] <thoughtsand> then it magically worked.
[16:45:10] <Tobbi> Hey! When I do this: http://jsfiddle.net/zG877/ how can I prevent the text from replacing everything inside the element? I just want to have the checkbox and then the text.
[16:45:26] <Tobbi> (And _el() is a wrapper around $ for my custom document location)
[16:49:12] <Tobbi> Ah, never mind. Found a solution.
[16:49:36] <devc> thoughtsand: I thought that too!
[16:50:53] <devc> I realize now that it actually is exploding... When I target another larger object I can see it as it fades out
[16:52:44] <devc> But it seems like there's some sort of layering going on. Z-index doesn't seem to be changing but if I set z-index:999 !important then the explode does absolutely nothing.
[16:54:16] <devc> The explosion comes from behind a hole in a transparent png which acts as a "frame", so the layout's a bit complicated, as is the javascript.
[16:55:08] <devc> The fact that z-index set to something !important breaks the explode animation feels good though, I think that means I'm getting somewhere.
[16:59:04] <fotoflo> hmm quick question. i have two elements <a class = "b /> <img class = "c" />  how do i select them both by class?
[16:59:38] <systemfault> 'b, c'
[16:59:41] <systemfault> err
[16:59:44] <systemfault> '.b, .c'
[17:02:58] <fotoflo> oh that fabulous comma!  thank you
[17:09:54] <fotoflo> systemfault:  next question.  I have <div id = "a"><a class = "b"><a class = "c"</div>  and <div id = "b"><a class = "b"><a class = "c"</div>  -- i want to select #a .b, #a .c  whoops, looks like I answered my own question ;-)
[17:21:26] <groklinux> using .change on select to fire off ajax request to php script which returns more selects...however, when i click on one of the returned selects, it's not firing the .change event...any help is appreciated
[17:25:59] <LessSeen> bind using live or re-bind
[17:27:01] <LessSeen> after loading new selects
[17:27:09] <groklinux> thanks LessSeen
[17:27:13] <LessSeen> or else they are loaded after the events are bound
[17:27:24] <LessSeen> np :)
[17:29:01] <groklinux> the problem was i wasn't binding it at all...live or otherwise: $("select").change(function()
[17:29:28] <groklinux> oops...jquery noob
[17:29:42] <LessSeen> .change binds
[17:31:02] <groklinux> well, i guess i need to create an actual function and then re-bind or (looks better to my untrained eye) use .live
[17:51:36] <muhoo> .live or .on ?
[17:52:07] <fotoflo> hmmrm, how do i position stuff relative to their parent div?
[17:53:21] <fotoflo> position relative seems to be positioning relative to where the element would go without positioning (so if the prior element in the flow is of variable height, the positioning gets screwed up)
[18:01:44] <bonhoffer> is there a way to see where the code that is firing is sitting?
[18:02:35] <aghouseh> anyone have experience with connecting a draggable to a sortable and getting '(this).data("draggable") is undefined' errors in firebug?
[18:19:05] <innociv> bonhoffer, well console log shows the line. But I guess you mean a stack trace of what lead to it.
[18:19:16] <innociv> That would be fantastic.  node.js has that.
[18:19:19] <bonhoffer> i got it -- profiler
[18:42:39] <Zackko> can someone help me make a handle that resizes 2 side-by-side panels without using a plugin?
[18:42:45] <Zackko> i tried and failed lol
[19:33:17] <krucial> i'm having trouble w/ .on() in 1.7.  Is there something special that needs to be done for it to work for dynamically created objects?
[19:37:08] <intellilogic> I have a $(document).on('change'... function instead of my docready, I also want to fire it the first its loaded (docready - before change).  How?
[19:51:06] <krucial> i'm having trouble w/ .on() in 1.7.  Is there something special that needs to be done for it to work for dynamically created objects?
[20:29:07] <Jon47> krucial it should work the same as .delegate did in the past, do you have an example of your issue we can look at?
[20:55:29] <krucial> @Jon47: Unfortunately I only have a local copy of the code.  One thing thats a little unique is that i'm trying to use this in conjunction with google maps, and this overlay plugin called an "infobox"  I dont know if google is doin too much javascript voodoo for .on() to handle
[20:56:15] <Jon47> you understand that you need to delegate the events on dynamic elements to currently existing elements, yes?
[20:56:45] <krucial> yes, I tried to use document, body, and then map_canvas which is the div that the google map renders in
[20:57:08] <krucial> and i used a class selector to try and apply a click event to a span
[20:57:25] <Jon47> hrm, ok that clears up the easy fix.. don't know anything about google maps API personally but I'd be happy to help if you can distill the issue to a fiddle...
[20:58:26] <krucial> sure let me see what I can do.
[21:03:53] <krucial> Jon47, if I have local js plugins, how can I get them in fiddle, would i just need to externally reference them, or can i use that javascript panel somehow?
[21:05:39] <Jon47> krucial yeah you need to get an external reference to them, generally
[21:05:55] <krucial> ok, thanks
[21:34:55] <necromancer> intellilogic: turn the on change callback into a global function and call it
[21:38:34] <necromancer> so $(document).on('change', function() { ... }) becomes function onChangeHandler() { ... } $(document).on('change', onChangeHandler);
[21:38:53] <necromancer> then you can just onChangeHandler(); to call it when doc ready gets fired
[21:44:37] <krucial> Jon47... almost there.. im learning this fiddle stuff lol
[21:47:45] <Umren> "Cannot apply to a dirty working tree, please stage your changes" when i try git stash apply
[22:01:30] <necromancer> Umren: you got untracked files in your repo, which you can't apply a stash over.
[22:01:37] <necromancer> type git status
[22:02:20] <Umren> # On branch master
[22:02:20] <Umren> nothing to commit (working directory clean)
[22:02:29] <Umren> git stash apply
[22:02:44] <Umren> Cannot apply to a dirty working tree, please stage your changes
[22:10:01] <necromancer> weird
[22:10:05] <necromancer> Umren: ask #git
[22:10:14] <Umren> yep
[22:24:49] <felipe_Brz> would someone please tell me why this var usr = $("#usernameinput").value(); doesn't seem to work? (the selected item is a input type="text"
[22:26:10] <felipe_Brz> oh nvm I keep forgetting it's val() rather than value()
[23:28:58] <darksnake747> Hey anyone here able to lend there mind for a tricky issue with attaching click events?
[23:29:55] <darksnake747> I have a case where attaching a click to one object seems to destroy previously created events on other objects...
[23:31:00] <Hierofant> are they bound?  are they same class?
[23:31:34] <darksnake747> http://pastebin.com/rER0u3tQ
[23:31:47] <darksnake747> thats the function causing the issue...
[23:32:04] <darksnake747> I am not all that great at JQuery...
[23:32:58] <darksnake747> pure JavaScript is stronger for me... but I'm not to well versed in JQuery... so forgive me if I seem... stupid with some stuff @.@
[23:33:47] <darksnake747> and I have tested this a lot...and can say that the params going in are unique each time this is called..
[23:35:23] <darksnake747> in fact, using alerts and other debugging methods, I can say that this is VERY confusing cause the dynamic dom elements are created correctly, and the vars are all set properly... but when I call this a second time... the first click event instance seems to die...
[23:45:02] <darksnake747> at this point... any advice would probably help...
[23:47:50] <Hierofant> nah, bad advice can be harmful or wasteful of time
[23:48:02] <Hierofant> I don't understand your code.  There's only one click but it's toggling
[23:48:29] <Hierofant> so either you have another click bound elsewhere in the document, or your toggle is actually the thing
[23:49:55] <darksnake747> well, that doc is a bit larger...
[23:50:06] <darksnake747> the system is a game record manager
[23:50:21] <darksnake747> basically the interface has a JUI tab display
[23:50:29] <Hierofant> so listen to the click events
[23:50:42] <Hierofant> throw console to see which one is working
[23:51:14] <darksnake747> I don't understand what you mean really... I'm sorry
[23:51:23] <darksnake747> I mean, I watch the console...
[23:51:32] <darksnake747> but its not showing me crap... =\
[23:51:38] <Hierofant> do you have firefox?
[23:51:44] <darksnake747> yea...
[23:51:54] <Hierofant> console.log("hello!")
[23:52:18] <Hierofant> with firebug
[23:52:23] <darksnake747> ok... let me try that...
[23:52:26] <darksnake747> also
[23:53:32] <hubbl3> We meet again.
[23:54:00] <darksnake747> so you may understand that code more - that is run several times and results in a Accordion-like panel being generated with this CLICK event on the title bar of the accordion panel... that TOGGLE is just the toggle of the content
[23:54:09] <darksnake747> haha - hey hubbl3
[23:54:53] <darksnake747> yea - found an example for Yii that basically said this would work... but... it didn't help, so... decided to go deeper with JQuery
[23:55:48] <Hierofant> always get the example to work first
[23:56:02] <Hierofant> eliminates stupid mistakes
[23:58:36] <Hierofant> try a jsfiddle
[23:58:38] <Hierofant> good luck
[23:58:44] <darksnake747> thanks man
[23:59:15] <darksnake747> so hubbl3... how ya doin?
