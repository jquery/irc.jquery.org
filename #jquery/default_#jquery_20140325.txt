[00:00:52] <bobbobbins> hey, i have an api i set up in rails, and I just want a lightweight way to interact with it, whats the best option? I tried ember and i think its just way more than i need right now
[00:36:30] <Cork> bobbobbins: kinda the wrong channel, but curl is your friend
[00:39:11] <bobbobbins> hmm, ok, i’ll check into it, thanks!
[01:21:06] <pinkfloyd> How can I bind Jquery UI's slider to Jquery UI's progress bar effectively?
[01:21:30] <Cork> pinkfloyd: just set the value of the progress from the slide callback
[01:27:19] <ocx> i have a jquery script defined in <body>, the script gets called correctly when loaded in a computer browser, when it gets called inside an android app as a webview it is notbeing executed. script is defined as var onDeviceReady = function() { .... } and is being called from body as: this.onDeviceReady(); any idea why this is not working fine on androids?
[01:28:45] <Cork> ocx: this.onDeviceReady()?
[01:28:59] <Cork> why not just onDeviceReady()
[01:29:00] <ocx> Cork: or onDeviceReady();
[01:29:13] <Cork> and you need to show the code
[01:30:14] <ocx> Cork: http://pastie.org/8966567 line 23 and 234 mainly
[01:30:28] <Cork> like i said before
[01:30:34] <Cork> script should be at the END of body
[01:30:35] <Cork> or in head
[01:30:40] <Cork> never at the start of body
[01:31:47] <Cork> ocx: also your using jqm
[01:31:55] <Cork> and it doesn't reload the full page for each page change
[01:32:25] <ocx> i tried in head same same but i will reput it there
[01:32:46] <Cork> ocx: just moving to head doesn't help
[01:32:53] <Cork> you arn't waiting for the dom to load
[01:33:12] <Cork> and like i said jqm won't do full page loads
[01:34:24] <ocx> Cork: ok noted, how can i overcome this pleasE?
[01:34:54] <pinkfloyd> Cork, what if I have multiple sliders and multiple progress bars?
[01:35:31] <Cork> pinkfloyd: either store a variable for the reference or use dom structure to find it
[01:35:43] <Cork> like $(this).next().progress()
[01:36:17] <ocx> Cork: i noticed that if i use document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false) instead of onDeviceReady() it works fine
[01:36:24] <Cork> ocx: well if you put jquery code anywhere except at the end of body you need to wait for jquery ready
[01:36:39] <Cork> ocx: and if you use jqm you need to listen for... page_init? i think it was
[01:37:13] <ocx> Cork: so you mean i can try putting that code at the end of body as a first attempt?
[01:37:16] <Cork> ocx: never head of an event called deviceready
[01:37:27] <Cork> ocx: yes
[01:37:31] <ocx> Cork: device ready is for the phone
[01:37:42] <Cork> ocx: it isn't a standard event
[01:38:04] <Cork> ah
[01:38:13] <Cork> it's a phonegap event
[01:38:29] <Cork> it only exists in phonegap code
[01:39:11] <ocx> yes Cork
[01:39:33] <pinkfloyd> How would I use DOM to find something like: <div id="eq">
[01:39:33] <pinkfloyd> <div> 40 </div>
[01:39:34] <pinkfloyd> </div>, looking for the number inbetween <div></div>? (40 in this case) - Cork
[01:39:52] <Cork> pinkfloyd: $('#eq')
[01:39:59] <Cork> pinkfloyd: and $('#eq').text()
[01:40:11] <pinkfloyd> thank you
[01:40:12] <ocx> s initially i open my app, main.html gets loaded, here device becomes ready but i dont want to load the script atthis stage, next user click on an href, which takes him to index2.html this is where i want to load the script but it only works when device is ready
[01:40:14] <Cork> np
[01:42:23] <ocx> Cork: i just want to understand why that function works only when i do a  document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false) instead of onDeviceReady()
[01:42:52] <Cork> ocx: cause the second one just runs the function
[01:43:06] <Cork> the first one binds it as a callback for the phonegap event
[01:43:11] <ocx> and the device is not ready or "has already been ready?
[01:43:21] <Cork> i don't know what the event means
[01:43:25] <Cork> i don't do phonegap
[01:43:52] <ocx> yea but usually if you add a listener  to an event that already happened, it will be triggered on the next event right?
[01:44:00] <Cork> no
[01:44:10] <Cork> that is a specific behavior of jquery read
[01:44:19] <Cork> and that isn't an event
[01:44:27] <ocx> if a mouse is already clicked, and then i add a onclick event will it be triggered?
[01:44:31] <Cork> for all normal events you get called when it fires
[01:44:38] <Cork> future events is unknown
[01:44:45] <Cork> ocx: no
[01:44:57] <Cork> you get the next click if there is one
[01:44:59] <ocx> i mean you click your mouse, then you add an event listener after it, it should not be triggered
[01:45:02] <ocx> yea
[01:45:14] <Cork> but again it depends on what phonegap does
[01:45:16] <ocx> so my issue here is the deviceready is getting called as soon as the application on my phone is opened
[01:45:30] <Cork> as it isn't a standard event there isn't a standard defining when it fires
[01:45:45] <ocx> so now when the user navigates and click on this new href which should call the script ondeviceready, it is not called since the event already happened
[01:46:19] <ocx> and if i call the script onDeviceReady() instead of adding a listener it doesnt work
[01:46:31] <ocx> i mean when i call href to call the script too...
[01:46:33] <Cork> again i don't know what deviceready means, but i don't see how click would have anything to do with it
[01:47:24] <ocx> Cork: how can i load a script when the whole dom is loaded
[01:47:45] <Cork> ocx: are you sure that is what you need?
[01:47:52] <Cork> are you use the entire page is reloaded?
[01:48:18] <ocx> yes an href is called
[01:48:33] <Cork> doesn't automatically means the entire page is reloaded
[01:48:39] <ocx> so i have that button on the main page, when clicked it will call an href
[01:48:43] <Cork> doesn't automatically means the entire page is reloaded
[01:48:55] <ocx> hrefdoesnt reload a new page?
[01:49:07] <Cork> in a default browser none js word it does
[01:49:10] <ocx> with the head and body of that page executed?
[01:49:16] <Cork> but jqm normally prevents it
[01:49:21] <Cork> and possibly phonegap
[01:49:29] <Cork> they fetch fragments with ajax
[01:49:33] <Cork> and updates the current page
[01:49:47] <ocx> so you mean maybe they fetch divs and such but avoid scripts ?
[01:50:06] <Cork> they fetch the page section
[01:50:14] <Cork> and replaces the current page section
[01:50:27] <ocx> so how can i fetch and execute those scripts
[01:51:03] <Cork> this is to not having to tear down the entire dogument
[01:51:04] <m4rtijn> hi
[01:51:07] <Cork> document
[01:51:13] <Cork> and instead it reuses the old one
[01:51:20] <ocx> ok
[01:51:23] <ocx> got your point
[01:51:25] <Cork> and through that saves in page load time
[01:51:39] <ocx> so how can i execute this script hehe
[01:51:39] <Cork> it makes a big difference
[01:51:44] <m4rtijn> does anyone know why I dont have utf-8 if I append a ajax reponse in a  div? If i look in the firebug ajax response.. its all ok..
[01:51:48] <Cork> like i said like 20 mins ago
[01:51:59] <Cork> jqm has a page_init or pageInit or something like that event
[01:52:04] <Cork> check the jqm docs
[01:52:31] <ocx> ok i would include the script on the page_init
[01:52:51] <Cork> m4rtijn: check the encoding of the page, the encoding of the scripts and the encoding of the ajax response
[01:53:10] <Cork> m4rtijn: most likely it sounds like your page isn't utf8
[01:53:31] <m4rtijn> Cork: its all utf-8 .. although the answer also contains a header and whatnot..
[01:53:42] <m4rtijn> maybe i need to remove those first
[01:53:45] <Cork> m4rtijn: link?
[01:53:58] <ocx> Cork: maybe jQuery(document).live('pageinit',function(event){     centerHeaderDiv();     updateOrientation();     settingsMenu.init();     menu();     hideMenuPopupOnBodyClick();  })
[01:54:05] <Cork> m4rtijn: when you append html to the page it needs to be a fragment
[01:54:09] <ocx> duno if live is deprecated though
[01:54:14] <Cork> m4rtijn: meaning anything outside body isn't allowed
[01:54:17] <triyo> Is it common practice to prevent "further clicks" on buttons when doing an ajax post of a form to server?
[01:54:31] <Cork> ocx: live has been replaced by delegate
[01:54:54] <Cork> ocx: though in he code you have there just on or bind should work
[01:54:54] <triyo> I.e. if users double clicks a button to submit an ajax-backed form
[01:54:55] <m4rtijn> ok Cork, thanks
[01:55:11] <Cork> triyo: it's a common problem
[01:55:29] <Cork> triyo: just set disabled on the submit button, it will make it visible to the user too
[01:55:36] <Tekla> if i have a div for notices that's usually hidden is it gonna work if i issue an ajax call when the user is heading in a direction where a specific text should be in that div to fill the appropriate text to give ajax some delay to fill it?
[01:55:48] <Cork> triyo: and don't forget to add an always callback to reenable it if the call fails for some reason
[01:55:56] <ocx> Cork: which code>
[01:56:49] <Cork> Tekla: it will be async, so you don't know when the data comes
[01:57:03] <Cork> Tekla: it depends on the response time to where the client happen to be
[01:57:20] <triyo> Cork: great. I was thinking of maybe removing the 'click' even for the button and changing the css on my button. effectively it's the same as disabling the button you suggested.
[01:57:27] <ocx> Cork: something like $(document).live("pageinit", function () { } ?
[01:57:30] <Tekla> user has to fill 5 or 6 fields so definitely 10+ seconds
[01:57:34] <ocx> can i use document like rhat
[01:57:35] <Cork> triyo: you should never use a click event on the button
[01:57:45] <Cork> triyo: you should use the submit event on the form
[01:58:13] <Cork> triyo: well unless the button isn't for submitting form fields then ya, click
[01:58:16] <Tekla> what event should i use on a button?! :s
[01:58:21] <Cork> none
[01:58:27] <Cork> if it is a form button
[01:58:31] <Tekla> it's not
[01:58:34] <Tekla> forms suck :p
[01:58:35] <triyo> Cork: I serialise the for and make a ajax call.
[01:58:41] <triyo> *for=form
[01:58:47] <Cork> triyo: it should still be a submit event on the form
[01:59:06] <Cork> triyo: you break browser features if you bind it on the button
[01:59:45] <triyo> Cork: ok, out of interest, which browser features?
[02:00:03] <Tekla> how do i register when a specific ajax call is done?
[02:00:14] <Tekla> nm :P
[02:00:15] <Cork> triyo: enter to submit, form value storage, user accessibility...
[02:00:17] <Cork> the list is long
[02:00:57] <triyo> wow, that is pretty bad.
[02:01:16] <Cork> yes
[02:01:25] <ocx> Cork: this keeps looping with the ajax loading button and page doesnt load $("#page").live("pageinit", function () { onDeviceReady()} );
[02:01:59] <Cork> triyo: the worst part is that it is not uncommon for js coders to use js first and not check what the standard want them to use
[02:02:11] <Cork> triyo: so lots of things break for no good reason
[02:02:19] <Cork> triyo: and it isn't even harder to use submit
[02:02:49] <triyo> Unless you have a wizard that consists of multiple forms and you wish to submit all in one go. :)
[02:03:07] <Cork> triyo: no actually not even then
[02:03:15] <Cork> i do that, and i do it from a submit event :)
[02:03:28] <triyo> Cork: well than I need your assistance please :)
[02:03:33] <Cork> you just let the submit event bubble to a parent
[02:03:41] <Cork> and grab all forms and submit them when you get an event
[02:04:08] <triyo> submit bubble to which parent?
[02:04:28] <Cork> $('form_parent').on('submit', function() { $(this).find('form').each(function() { }) })
[02:04:47] <Cork> opps forgot the preventDefault() call
[02:05:06] <triyo> yip, I understand the preventDefault part
[02:05:53] <triyo> So you have a parent form that encloses all the other forms (e.g. one for each wizard step)?
[02:06:01] <Cork> no not a parent form
[02:06:08] <Cork> you arn't allowed to net forms
[02:06:13] <Cork> *nest
[02:06:19] <triyo> Thats what I though
[02:06:31] <Cork> but event bubbles from a child to the parent
[02:06:37] <Cork> all the way up to document
[02:06:48] <Tekla> Cork: so ... if i run that ajax call that loads the text and put a var in the .done() section and later when i want to use the text can i put a sleep while var is false kinda expression?
[02:06:48] <triyo> Oh I see.
[02:06:50] <Cork> so you just have to set a parent to listen for the event as it bubbles up
[02:07:08] <triyo> Ok, now I get it.
[02:07:18] <keriati> hello
[02:07:34] <Cork> Tekla: you can, but the code will be unstable
[02:07:47] <Cork> Tekla: cause if the connection is fast you get a delay for no good reason
[02:07:58] <Cork> Tekla: and if the connection is really slow you get an empty var
[02:08:12] <Cork> Tekla: so the adding of the content needs to happen from the done callback
[02:08:24] <Cork> else you get racy behavior
[02:08:31] <krambiorix> how can i get the current dialog object in open: function(event, ui) {  ...}  ?
[02:08:48] <Cork> krambiorix: quite sure it is $(this)
[02:08:54] <Cork> or this.element
[02:09:03] <Cork> if your talking about jquery ui dialog that is
[02:11:06] <triyo> Cork: thanks for your help. Btw, I have another somewhat related question. How do you in general deal with guys that temper with client-side code and then submit it to the server? Do you find yourself hashing the vulnerable input fields?
[02:11:13] <krambiorix> Cork, it's $(this)  , thanks!
[02:11:43] <Cork> triyo: all sanity checks MUST be server side
[02:12:13] <triyo> Cork: thought as much and at the mo I run a set of assertions (sanity checks as you say)
[02:12:13] <Cork> triyo: server side should be able to handle getting the data as an api
[02:12:43] <Cork> the js code is just there to make it look better
[02:13:42] <triyo> Cork: well easier said than done wen dealing with Single Page heavy Apps.
[02:13:59] <Cork> triyo: not really
[02:15:17] <triyo> I guess as long as you keep logic out of js that server is oblivious to
[02:15:31] <triyo> That's the real danger I see.
[02:15:41] <Cork> triyo: well no
[02:15:49] <Cork> you just make sure to always design the backend first
[02:15:53] <Cork> and then attach the client side
[02:16:06] <Cork> and while you create the backend you make sure you secure the data inputs
[02:16:15] <Cork> and when you then put in the client side
[02:16:27] <Cork> the server side will kick you if you do something wrong
[02:16:50] <Cork> so basically your success in js is that you don't see the exceptions from server side
[02:17:04] <triyo> Yup, I have restful services that do exactly this
[02:17:15] <Cork> then i don't see the problem
[02:17:35] <Cork> just don't see js as part of the security logic
[02:17:42] <Cork> see it as something there to help the user
[02:18:11] <Cork> like the server is the judge, and js is the guide helping you please the judge :)
[02:18:15] <Tekla> Cork: thanks :)
[02:18:29] <triyo> Cork: nice analogy :)
[02:19:41] <krambiorix> Cork, $(this) in dialog open() is the dialog content
[02:19:55] <Cork> krambiorix: jquery ui dialog?
[02:20:10] <Cork> krambiorix: this is the element you ran .dialog() on
[02:20:23] <Cork> if you want to work with the wrappers use $(this).dialog('widget')
[02:20:34] <shredding> Is it possible to use this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/table-column-toggle/ with plain jquery?
[02:20:49] <Cork> krambiorix: the but content element is the element you normally want to fiddle with
[02:20:53] <shredding> (I could load jquery mobile js, but am not using it)
[02:21:30] <Cork> shredding: that code isn't hard to implement
[02:21:30] <krambiorix> Cork, yeah, just wanted to let you know
[02:23:02] <keriati> do you know if there is any way to modify the XMLHttpRequest that  $.ajax will from the beforeSend method?
[02:23:20] <m4rtijn> Cork:  in my ajax response, i removed all header data.. but its still not showing the "special chars" could I PM you the url?
[02:23:20] <keriati> will use*
[02:23:43] <Cork> keriati: you prob want to have a look at... transport i think it's called
[02:23:46] <Cork> ?api transport
[02:23:47] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:24:06] <Cork> keriati: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport/
[02:24:16] <keriati> i'm looking at it right now
[02:24:41] <Cork> m4rtijn: sure
[02:27:16] <ocx> an eventlistener only works in the context of the page that loads it right? means i cannot have an eventlistener in page1 listen to some elements in page 2 Cork ?
[02:27:19] <Cork> m4rtijn: the change the doctype to <!doctype html>
[02:27:47] <Cork> ocx: if element you attach it to is removed so is the event listener
[02:28:00] <Cork> ocx: same as when you attach them with jquery
[02:28:30] <ocx> so Cork for instance i can create an event listener on non existant elements and then create the elements?
[02:29:18] <m4rtijn> ok thanks CosmicLogick
[02:29:21] <ocx> like create an eventlistenerr on #new and then create <div #new>
[02:29:21] <m4rtijn> Cork: *
[02:29:59] <Cork> m4rtijn: i'm not saying that will fix it, but it is a problem you need to fix
[02:30:09] <Cork> before anything else is even worth looking into
[02:30:27] <ocx> Cork: can i include the divs and elements of page1 in page2?
[02:30:34] <ocx> like incpude everrything in page2
[02:30:50] <Cork> ocx: yes, but that will be slow
[02:31:48] <Cork> m4rtijn: also the server response looks like ascii to me
[02:31:59] <Cork> m4rtijn: check so the php page actually sends the correct encoding
[02:33:37] <m4rtijn> Cork: It did not fix it
[02:33:57] <m4rtijn> ok, will check that
[02:34:34] <Cork> m4rtijn: this is how i got to the conclution about accii
[02:35:07] <Cork> m4rtijn: if i view the raw response data from the ajax call i find "werden, z.B. mi"
[02:36:41] <m4rtijn> yes?
[02:37:21] <m4rtijn> but all the special chars display correctly in the raw response.. sorry im a bit confused by char encoding
[02:37:39] <Cork> m4rtijn: cause the ajax doesn't have any encoding specified
[02:37:51] <Cork> so the preview sniffs it
[02:38:06] <Cork> while the page explicitly says it is utf8
[02:38:22] <m4rtijn> i tried specifying it in the ajax call, but i get an error
[02:38:47] <m4rtijn> by: dataType: "text/html; charset: utf-8",
[02:38:57] <Cork> you don't specify it client side
[02:39:03] <Cork> you specify it server side in the response
[02:39:19] <Cork> or you just make sure the php really generates utf8 code
[02:39:30] <Cork> simplest is to just make sure the file is saved in utf8
[02:40:04] <m4rtijn> yes.. ive done that
[02:40:26] <m4rtijn> i even tried iconv in the php side
[02:41:44] <m4rtijn> thanks for the tips Cork.. ill play around a bit more
[02:42:54] <Cork> m4rtijn: when you add it to the ajax response how are you trying to do it?
[02:43:30] <Cork> header('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8'); should solve the problem
[02:45:20] <AmR|EiSa> any help with this code http://jsfiddle.net/n74Yg/1/ ?
[02:45:41] <Cork> its a link?
[02:45:47] <Cork> or help with what?
[02:45:59] <Cork> == please ask a question don't just throw a link into the channel
[02:47:01] <AmR|EiSa> $(document).ready(function () { $("#rowCount").button().click(function () { alert("Rows = " + ($('table.DataTable tr:last').index() + 1)); });};);
[02:48:26] <keriati> so is there any way to attach the ajaxTransport to all datatypes? (to all requests?)
[02:49:17] <Cork> keriati: haven't fiddled with it for a while, but i think you set dataType to trigger the specific transporter
[02:50:14] <Cork> keriati: so you can override the default handlers if you want to make them do what you want
[02:50:26] <Cork> like "text" or "html" or "script"
[02:50:38] <keriati> oh yes now it started to work
[02:50:51] <keriati> thanks
[02:50:55] <Cork> np
[02:51:07] <AmR|EiSa> any help about this code bug, $(document).ready(function () { $("#rowCount").button().click(function () { alert("Rows = " + ($('table.DataTable tr:last').index() + 1)); });};); ???
[02:51:29] <Cork> AmR|EiSa: you need to ask a question
[02:51:50] <Cork> all i can say it ok you bind a click handler on a button
[02:51:51] <Cork> and?
[02:52:13] <keriati> so i want to override the send event in ajaxTransport, but can i access the original "send method" ?
[02:52:25] <AmR|EiSa> Cork: It's not run at all.
[02:52:37] <Cork> keriati: good question, donno
[02:53:01] <Cork> ok, so parsing fails
[02:53:22] <Cork> AmR|EiSa: you have an extra ; on line 8 in the fiddle
[02:59:15] <ocx> Cork: what happens if i add an event listener 2 times
[02:59:29] <keriati>  i need a way to attach an eventlistener to the XMLHttpRequest.upload somewhere but a global solution would be nice for all ajax requests
[02:59:35] <srava> hello, anyone up?
[03:10:07] <ocx> Cork: i solved it :)
[03:10:24] <ocx> $(document).on('pageinit', '#page', function(){
[03:10:40] <ocx> as you said jqm is tricky does not load the whole page with headers
[03:10:46] <ocx> thank you
[03:13:44] <SprkDev> Does anyone understand where the bootstrap div placement should be?
[03:14:11] <SprkDev> I am loading dom from another URL.
[03:14:47] <ocx> Cors
[03:16:13] <SprkDev> I have this <a  data-toggle="modal" data-keyboard="true" data-target="#watchvideo .modal-content" href="<?php echo get_permalink(); ?> .single-video-post" onClick="" >
[03:16:53] <SprkDev> does this go above or below this http://pastebin.com/Ws7GYS7j ???
[03:19:48] <seutje> don4t think it matters, but usually you dump useless wrappers like a modal at the end of the body, if the script doesn't just generate it upon triggering it
[03:22:29] <SprkDev> Thanks for that. Can someone also answer this please. Because I have scoured the internet for days now. Nothing. And when I ask this question here there are no responses. Q: The part in the pastebin is a placehold (a template of sorts) where DOM from remote URL can be loaded. True?
[03:22:42] <SprkDev> *placeholder
[03:22:52] <ocx> 	<a id="settings1"  href="index.html" data-role="button" data-icon="home" data-iconpos="right" >Back</a> <--- where should i put the icon images
[03:22:53] <ocx> which folder
[03:23:42] <Macaveli> In rails I'm doing respond_to with json and a message but how do I read it in my complete:function? More information about my problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22613020/rails-respond-with-json-to-show-flashes-in-ajax/22614441?noredirect=1#22614441
[03:24:31] <SprkDev> ?
[03:29:25] <SprkDev> hello?! There it is its happened again.
[03:31:02] <Cork> Macaveli: the first argument in the complete function is the parsed json
[03:31:12] <seutje> anything is a placeholder where you can inject content from a remote source, I suppose
[03:31:46] <Macaveli> Cork,  let met check that after dinner. Thanks for the response
[03:33:53] <SprkDev> Thanks :-). Here comes the main question. So why then does my placeholder(template) lose its header when the DOM loads? It's like it complete replaces it, instead of looking the same.
[03:34:04] <SprkDev> *completely
[03:38:54] <SprkDev> ???
[03:46:53] <keriati> just found a solution to attach upload progress event handler in a nice way: https://gist.github.com/keriati/9759016  any feedback to this maybe? (i know it isn't a crossbrowser solution at this point)
[03:48:34] <seutje> SprkDev: the pastebin you showed is just a bunch of DIVs, I don't see any header in there that could disappear
[03:50:31] <SprkDev> sorry, I removed the header after a while seeeing that it was getting completely replaced. But that is the case. I would see the template(placeholder) together with the header, for one second. But other than the header and the footer the modal window would be completely blank for 1 second. And then the remote URL loads the DOM, completely removing the header and the footer. I just removed...
[03:50:33] <SprkDev> ...the header and footer temporarily so that the difference wouldn't be so obvious for now.
[03:51:10] <SprkDev> why does the remote url replace the placeholder?
[03:51:11] <the8thbit> Cork: You around?
[03:51:18] <Cork> ?ask
[03:51:18] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:52:13] <the8thbit> Cork: Sorry. Was looking for you specifically because you helped me with this before. Remember how I was dynamically loading multiple instances of the same html and then populating it?
[03:52:27] <SprkDev> So I've put this back, and basically everything else I said is still valid. Still the header and footer dissapears when remote DOM loads. Why?
[03:52:29] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/ZGFhzzef
[03:52:43] <the8thbit> Well, it was working perfectly, in Firefox, however, in Chrome and Opera some of them don't get populated
[03:53:16] <the8thbit> I can't figure out why the ones that don't don't. It's not random, but it's not like its the first or last x entries or something
[03:53:48] <the8thbit> e.g., in chrome entries 1-4 and entry 8 are unpopulated
[03:54:27] <the8thbit> you can see the difference here: http://435-teamnoname.rhcloud.com/user/james
[03:54:33] <the8thbit> just open that in FF and in Chrome
[03:55:35] <poolson> http://pastie.org/8966905
[03:55:45] <poolson> anyone got any stellar insight as to why this click isnt working ?
[03:56:02] <poolson> theres an attribute in the tag that is called "Ajaxify"
[03:56:18] <poolson> so im wondering if theres something going on there prohibiting my click working
[03:56:30] <Cork> the8thbit: have you checked if the request is actually sent?
[03:56:37] <poolson> ideally i want to click it with a mousedown .. but neither works
[03:57:15] <SprkDev> ?
[03:57:28] <the8thbit> Cork: How would I go about doing that from Chrome? (Im not too familiar with the dev panel, I'm so used to FireBug)
[03:57:42] <Cork> the8thbit: check the network panel
[03:57:49] <decx> why are you loading jquery 12 times the8thbit ?
[03:58:11] <Cork> poolson: you can't click link tags
[03:58:25] <Cork> poolson: click on links only fires js events, it won't do the default action
[03:58:52] <Cork> poolson: this is by design to prevent link spamming visitors
[03:58:53] <poolson> ah
[03:59:07] <Cork> you can do something like window.location = this.href
[03:59:09] <the8thbit> decx: Good question. It made me giggle a little. I'm probably loading it in each of those pages I'm loading into the container
[03:59:12] <Cork> but it only works for one link
[03:59:14] <SprkDev> Does anyone know why the entire placeholder gets replaced? I have a feeling it might have something to do with data-target.
[03:59:17] <Cork> as it will then unload the page
[03:59:26] <the8thbit> decx: You think that could be related to my problem?
[03:59:33] <poolson> i clicked it before ... but perhaps i was clicking the parent div
[03:59:56] <decx> maybe
[04:00:01] <Cork> poolson: i meant line 5
[04:00:06] <SprkDev> my data-target is equal to watchvideo. And the id of the placeholder is watchvideo. So it seems it places the entire content starting from the very top of the div.
[04:00:24] <the8thbit> Deploying without the extra jqueries now
[04:00:40] <poolson> cork .. yah i mean i have "clicked" before but perhaps i was just firing some action on one of its parents
[04:00:45] <poolson> ill have to look again
[04:00:46] <SprkDev> do I need to change my datatarget such as data-target= "#watchvideo .modal-body" ???
[04:00:57] <SprkDev> but when I do this it doesn't work.
[04:01:36] <SprkDev> I want the DOM to start loading into modal-content and not replace the whole thing
[04:04:42] <poolson> hey Cork did you mean jquery specifically wont allow it .. or javascript in general ?
[04:04:48] <poolson> maybe thats how i clicked before
[04:04:53] <Cork> poolson: browsers
[04:05:00] <poolson> hmmmm
[04:05:09] <Cork> poolson: as in no browser will follow the link if you fire a click event on it
[04:05:12] <the8thbit> Removed the extra jquery, population seems a little faster now :)
[04:05:29] <the8thbit> also, I lied, it is random which ones don't get populated
[04:05:32] <poolson> welll it was just loading some modal
[04:05:37] <the8thbit> if you refresh, its different each time
[04:05:39] <poolson> maybe thats why it "worked" before
[04:05:43] <Cork> poolson: that isn't the default action
[04:05:59] <Cork> poolson: what you do with the click event isn't something we can tell
[04:06:05] <poolson> yah
[04:06:12] <poolson> its also inside a uiwebview on a phone
[04:06:21] <poolson> so yah .. a fev variables
[04:06:23] <poolson> few
[04:06:31] <the8thbit> Cork: When I click on 'network' all I see is jquery.min.map
[04:06:45] <Cork> the8thbit: reload the page
[04:07:25] <the8thbit> ah, thanks
[04:11:23] <the8thbit> Cork: I see all the topics when I check delta?name=james, if that's what you mean
[04:11:32] <SprkDev> ??
[04:13:04] <Cork> the8thbit: uh make sure the ajax calls is there
[04:13:10] <poolson> woot .. got it working :)
[04:13:23] <Cork> if all are fired but you don't get the response check if all the callbacks are fired
[04:13:32] <Cork> and then work your way down from there
[04:14:14] <the8thbit> That's the get... and I'm getting a response for all of the, apperently
[04:14:21] <the8thbit> so... the issue is totally clientside?
[04:14:46] <Cork> the8thbit: and the number of calls is the number you expect?
[04:15:00] <Cork> the8thbit: you need to dig up where things fails
[04:15:15] <Cork> start by making sure all the requests that should happen happens
[04:15:17] <the8thbit> Cork: Yep. Correct number, correct contents
[04:15:31] <Cork> ok then check in the ajax response handler
[04:15:43] <Cork> and start checking if it fires the correct number of times
[04:15:49] <the8thbit> Just click the 'Response' tab?
[04:15:59] <Cork> no
[04:16:11] <the8thbit> ohhh
[04:16:19] <the8thbit> nevermind, I understand what you're saying
[04:21:34] <the8thbit> hm, so all of the callbacks are firing, and they contain the correct topics, however, I noticed something odd
[04:21:48] <the8thbit> I set it up so that it alerts me right as each callback begins
[04:22:07] <Cork> the8thbit: don't use alert for async debugging
[04:22:11] <the8thbit> when that happens, in firefox, I get an alert, close it, and then immediately the entry both loads and is populated
[04:22:24] <the8thbit> Where as in chrome this appears to happen asynchronously
[04:22:27] <Cork> alert reorders events you can't trust it in that context
[04:22:34] <the8thbit> Ah, ok
[04:22:39] <Cork> use console.log
[04:22:41] <the8thbit> What should I use instead
[04:22:45] <the8thbit> okie, will do
[04:23:00] <Cork> well honestly don't ever use alert for debugging :)
[04:23:19] <the8thbit> hm.. its been useful in the past
[04:23:31] <the8thbit> in that it breaks the flow of rendering
[04:23:36] <Cork> ya, pre firebug introduction console.log ^^'
[04:23:47] <the8thbit> lol
[04:23:59] <Cork> well the browsers has to do a lot of messed up tricks to try to comply with the specs for alert
[04:24:16] <Cork> and that makes it unreliable as a debugging tool
[04:24:19] <the8thbit> I see, so it can significantly distort what you see?
[04:24:24] <Cork> yes
[04:24:42] <Cork> like it can affect the order code will execute
[04:25:03] <the8thbit> :)
[04:29:37] <the8thbit> I see, so the problem appears to be that this is not working sometimes: $( '#delta-content' + cb_i ).find( '.convols-topic' ).html( res[cb_i].topic );
[04:30:00] <Cork> do you have the code section again?
[04:30:14] <the8thbit> If I call console.log( $( '#delta-content' + cb_i ).find( '.convols-topic' ).html() ); after it then I get undifined for the ones that dont show up
[04:30:28] <the8thbit> sure, I'll post it with the new debug line too
[04:30:47] <Cork> i suspect this is a variable scope problem
[04:30:51] <Cork> but i don't remember the code
[04:31:04] <the8thbit> Cork: http://hastebin.com/sunapowiso.js
[04:31:18] <Cork> ...
[04:31:30] <Cork> and please use a pb that takes less then 5 mins to load
[04:32:20] <the8thbit> Cork: Sorry. Which do you suggest? I only use hastebin because someone on IRC told me to use it
[04:32:31] <Cork> the8thbit: ... it sucks
[04:33:05] <the8thbit> Cork: Whats better? I was using pastebin, but apparently that sucks too
[04:33:13] <Cork> the8thbit: i prefer jsbin or jsfiddle, but any page where the code can be changed without doing a separate post is fine
[04:33:14] <the8thbit> Is there a wastebin?
[04:33:27] <Cork> and where the page loads reasonably fast
[04:34:21] <the8thbit> Cork: http://jsbin.com/qamopose/1/
[04:34:54] <Cork> uh
[04:35:15] <Cork> the8thbit: why are you using i and cb_i?
[04:35:49] <the8thbit> Cork: Was using cb_i so that the index is right for the callback
[04:36:00] <the8thbit> its hackish, but I wasn't sure how else to do it
[04:36:25] <Cork> the8thbit: you have the problem there
[04:36:40] <Cork> you don't know in what order load will fire its callbacks
[04:37:05] <the8thbit> Ah...
[04:37:48] <the8thbit> So e.g. the 4th could go before the 3rd, and then the 3rd will never get populated?
[04:38:27] <Cork> uh
[04:38:27] <the8thbit> How do I get around this? I made the same mistake elsewhere in my server-side code and it's probably causing the same issue, but more subtley
[04:38:29] <Cork> wait a min
[04:38:50] <Cork> the8thbit: what are you doing with load?
[04:39:05] <Cork> the8thbit: i'm trying to get my head around what your trying to do
[04:39:07] <the8thbit> grabbing the html from convols
[04:39:10] <Cork> the code is a bit confused
[04:39:31] <the8thbit> I have a container, and I'm using load to put an HTML file in the container
[04:39:47] <Cork> and what about res[cb_i].topic?
[04:39:50] <the8thbit> and then I'm using the callback to modify the inner html of that I just loaded
[04:39:58] <Cork> why isn't that just in the response from the start?
[04:40:24] <the8thbit> Hm? It is? res is the response?
[04:40:33] <Cork> no
[04:40:39] <Cork> res is the response from the get call
[04:40:44] <the8thbit> yes
[04:40:50] <Cork> you then run load to fetch /modules/convols/
[04:41:18] <Cork> and why don't you just have the data topic in the response from that call?
[04:41:37] <Cork> or is /modules/convols/ some from of static template or something?
[04:41:48] <the8thbit> Ah, because I didn't know I could do that
[04:41:55] <the8thbit> convols is a jade file
[04:42:27] <Cork> ok...
[04:42:31] <Cork> lots of restructuring
[04:42:47] <the8thbit> ?
[04:43:29] <Cork> give me a min
[04:43:37] <the8thbit> sure thing, thanks
[04:43:50] <SprkDev> how can I change the URL in the address bar when I click my modal. I have link just need to put it in address bar.
[04:44:22] <ocx> my icons in jqm are seen when using a laptop when i use android i dont see them
[04:49:07] <Cork> the8thbit: i think this should work http://jsbin.com/qamopose/2/edit
[04:50:08] <the8thbit> Cork: Thank you! Reading and implementing now
[04:50:33] <Cork> the8thbit: try to understand the difference in the approach
[04:50:53] <Cork> it might be wrong, but from what i understood your explanation, this should be what you want
[04:51:15] <Cork> the8thbit: this should significantly reduce the the number of calls to the server
[04:51:42] <Cork> from 1+1^n to 2
[04:52:01] <the8thbit> Wow, awesome
[04:52:06] <the8thbit> now do that for all my code lol
[04:52:36] <the8thbit> hm, $.map() is cool
[04:52:42] <Cork> it is
[04:53:34] <SprkDev> what is the modal event for when the modal windows is displayed
[04:55:04] <spygame> is there any event for jquery datepicker like onInit or something similar ? i tried using beforeShow and beforeShowDay but their sequence of execution does not suit my use case,
[04:55:33] <the8thbit> Cork: Hmm, I can't do id: 'delta-content' + i as I'm not in a for loop anymore
[04:55:45] <Cork> opps
[04:55:47] <Cork> correct
[04:55:50] <fabioportieri> my agency once again gave me some work to do at home :°
[04:55:54] <Cork> the8thbit: you can get the value from map though
[04:56:20] <the8thbit> right, looking into that now
[04:56:36] <Cork> the8thbit: $.map(data, function(delta) { => $.map(data, function(delta, i) {
[04:56:47] <the8thbit> right
[04:57:35] <the8thbit> Cork: Yay it works!
[04:57:45] <Cork> the8thbit: also another gain you might want to know of
[04:57:56] <Cork> the8thbit: this code makes one append for the entire set of elements
[04:58:14] <Cork> the8thbit: it causes the page to reflow once instead of once for every post
[04:58:25] <Cork> so it also means it will update faster
[04:58:43] <Cork> (the bigger your page is the more speed difference you get from that)
[04:58:44] <the8thbit> Ah, yes
[04:59:00] <the8thbit> I was reading about that recently, actually
[04:59:21] <ankurk_> yo xKraty_: remember that table? I would have to do that again :|
[04:59:23] <Cork> the8thbit: that is why i used map and append the return value from map
[05:01:26] <SprkDev> how do I get the url when I in modal. I am trying to use window.history.pushstate and window.location.pathname to get these values but it ain't working.
[05:03:16] <Cork> SprkDev: check if "this" is the link triggering it
[05:03:16] <the8thbit> Cork: Going to take a shower and get ready for class now, thanks for the help
[05:03:24] <Cork> the8thbit: np
[05:04:12] <Cork> uh.. wait a min 1+1^n...
[05:04:20] <Cork> where did i put my calculus to day...
[05:04:25] <Cork> >_<
[05:04:33] <Cork> 1+1*n
[05:04:58] <SprkDev> do I use this for that? $(this).trigger('opened');
[05:05:41] <Cork> SprkDev: "in the modal" if this references to the link triggering the dialog
[05:05:44] <Cork> you could do this.href
[05:05:53] <Cork> but donno the code
[05:06:15] <SprkDev> I have this http://pastebin.com/izFpMkUq
[05:14:41] <SprkDev> Okay that problem solved. But now modal won't open second time. Why?
[05:14:59] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/CM0vjcye
[05:17:20] <krambiorix> is it possibe to select all text in an input field when focussing it?
[05:18:49] <Cork> krambiorix: sure
[05:20:20] <krambiorix> Cork, this is what i tried: http://jsfiddle.net/dDJLn/
[05:20:26] <Cork> krambiorix: something like $('input').on('focus', function() { this.select(); }); should work
[05:20:42] <Cork> krambiorix: not a jquery function
[05:21:16] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/dDJLn/1/
[05:22:37] <SprkDev> Boostrap modal won't open second time after close. Why?
[05:22:53] <krambiorix> Cork,  okay great, thanks!!
[05:27:11] <SprkDev> Boostrap modal won't open second time after close. Why?
[05:27:57] <SprkDev> I've realized its got to do with something on the lines of 12-15 on this paste http://pastebin.com/CM0vjcye
[05:41:06] <petzup> i have problem in this code http://pastebin.com/Yu5Ef9iw, it works after second click and not after first, what is problem?
[05:42:13] <Cork> petzup: check your selectors
[05:42:23] <Cork> that they actually match what you expect them to
[05:43:14] <petzup> i get alert("bla"); which is after that $('.reference_vse').click(function () { after second time i click?
[05:43:45] <Cork> so the click event doesn't fire at all?
[05:44:31] <petzup> it fires after second click, after first click it calls function ok, but after second click i get throught $('.reference_vse').click(function () {
[05:44:32] <Tekla> how do i trigger another ajax from a .done() section?
[05:47:30] <SprkDev> same value when I close the modal window now and open another item, it shows old content in modal. Is it not closing properly?
[05:48:00] <Cork> petzup: you inverted the question
[05:48:14] <Cork> petzup: doesn't the click handler fire at all on the first click?
[05:48:27] <petzup> Cork: no it doesnt
[05:48:48] <Cork> petzup: then the problem isn't in the code you posted
[05:49:01] <Cork> petzup: check what is calling the function you have around it
[05:49:03] <petzup> where is problem then?
[05:49:43] <petzup> hm
[05:49:52] <petzup> can i post complete html?
[05:50:03] <Cork> jsbin.com
[05:50:31] <petzup> ok
[05:54:44] <petzup> if i do it this way http://pastebin.com/9tr5jzvS it works but not for all
[05:55:25] <Cork> petzup: you are prob adding new elements somewhere
[05:55:31] <Cork> try using a delegated event listener
[05:55:39] <petzup> what is this?
[05:55:50] <Cork> $(document).on('click, '.reference_vse', function() {}
[05:58:09] <petzup> i get this error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[05:58:24] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/NnwD0nFA
[05:58:48] <Cork> petzup: not instead of the ready
[05:58:53] <Cork> instead of the click handler
[05:59:15] <Cork> $('.reference_vse').click(function () { => $(document).on('click', '.reference_vse', function() {
[06:01:15] <petzup> waa it worx
[06:01:23] <petzup> works pefectly!! tnx!
[06:01:27] <petzup> one bit question more
[06:02:15] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/5NckuAab here i have only for opening div -> $('#referenca_'+$(this).attr('id')).show('slow'); how would i make that i can open/close with same button?
[06:02:44] <Velveeta> .toggle instead of .show
[06:03:02] <Velveeta> yay, i answered one!
[06:03:55] <petzup> but it doesnt work ok it jumps and than close
[06:04:21] <PlxAnswer> Help by answering a single stupid question. Thanks in advance! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pv0Fq87udiUXLQ-DJhDQnKwjZFGpX4D-3y2OMaEvaeY/viewform
[06:04:32] <Velveeta> petzup: can you make a demo out of that to show me what you mean?
[06:05:02] <petzup> hm dont know how would i record it
[06:06:14] <Velveeta> not record, use a site like jsbin or jsfiddle to set up a functional demo
[06:06:46] <petzup> a little bit hard to do it because everything is in php except this jquery code which i paste
[06:07:34] <Velveeta> we don't need to see the entire page, just take a small snippet of html that this is focused on, and a small snippet of javascript to make it do what you're seeing it do
[06:08:30] <petzup> okey
[06:08:59] <SprkDev> okay now I am trying to do this but it still doesnt work. http://www.whiletrue.it/how-to-update-the-content-of-a-modal-in-twitter-bootstrap/
[06:09:35] <petzup> http://pastebin.com/W3yZAGhc
[06:09:43] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/i3XudGRK
[06:10:15] <Velveeta> petzup: that's not a functional demo, use jsbin or jsfiddle to create a functional one that we can interact with and tweak to get your desired behavior
[06:10:22] <petzup> the thing is that i have 3 divs after 3 divs i have one big div where other 3 are fully displayed
[06:10:41] <petzup> ok will try
[06:10:44] <Velveeta> not to mention that includes php, i said we don't need to see all of that
[06:11:06] <Velveeta> just take a small snippet of html that shows your expandable container, and combine it with a small snippet of js that binds up your toggle functionality, and put that in a jsfiddle demo
[06:11:15] <alexidoia> hello, I want to disable the a of a menu (so that nothing happens when on click on it). But I don't want to get rid of the a since I use a a:hover to display a submenu, here is my code : $("div#header a.sf-with-ul").attr("href", "#")
[06:11:19] <alexidoia> is that correct ?
[06:12:20] <Velveeta> sprkdev: if you're going to put inlined js like that (bad practice) you should define the function externally and reference the function name in that attribute
[06:13:28] <Velveeta> alexidoia: that won't disable the click behavior on the a, it'll just make the click add a # to the url (and potentially jump the page to the top when the user clicks on it), you should do something like this instead: $("div#header a.sf-with-ul").on('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[06:13:52] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9VAV/
[06:14:26] <alexidoia> Velveeta: thanks
[06:14:34] <Velveeta> alexidoia: no problemo
[06:15:07] <Velveeta> petzup: that page isn't loading... it's just spinning
[06:15:09] <SprkDev> how would I put that into external js and call it?
[06:15:23] <Velveeta> petzup: ok, it's finally up
[06:15:50] <Velveeta> sprkdev: pull the contents of that attribute value out and wrap it in a function foo() {}, and then make your href reference javascript:foo();
[06:16:31] <DaniG2k> guys I'm trying to click a div within a list element and have that show a block when clicked using an easeOutBounce effect
[06:16:40] <DaniG2k> but its getting formatted all oddly
[06:16:46] <DaniG2k> I'll post the code on jsfiddle
[06:17:03] <Velveeta> petzup: this thing still isn't a functional demo, there's no jquery library being included in the demo, so it's throwing exceptions on what you're trying to execute, and i'm not sure what .ias() is, but that definition's not being included in the demo either..
[06:17:43] <petzup> it doesnt want to work dont know why
[06:17:47] <petzup> on jsfiddle
[06:18:04] <Velveeta> it doesn't want to work because you have to tell it what libraries it needs to load, using those options in the left column
[06:18:11] <DaniG2k> can anyone help with this plz: http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/
[06:18:14] <petzup> http://jsfiddle.net/Y9VAV/2/
[06:18:19] <Velveeta> you have to tell it you want to load jquery, and you have to tell it where to find a definition for .ias()
[06:18:32] <DaniG2k> I'd like for the box that says Summary goes here to drop down when the list elements are clicked
[06:18:37] <petzup> i delited out .ias() its not important here
[06:18:42] <petzup> deleted*
[06:18:50] <Velveeta> danig2k: you need to add a reference to jquery in your demo also
[06:19:43] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: as such? http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/2/
[06:19:54] <Velveeta> that be the way :)
[06:20:28] <SprkDev> I've done this but it doesn call javascript function. it reloads page http://pastebin.com/79rQ4Hj4
[06:20:28] <DaniG2k> hmm but the box doesnt dropdown
[06:20:40] <DaniG2k> when I click on the rounded-list element
[06:20:42] <SprkDev> <a onClick="javascript: loaded();" href="<?php echo $permlink ?>" >
[06:21:17] <Velveeta> danig2k: you're targeting a pseudo-selector to attach your event listener to, i'm pretty sure that's not allowed, as pseudo-selector types of elements don't actually exist as part of the physical dom
[06:21:25] <Velveeta> they're for presentational aspects only
[06:21:27] <DaniG2k> oops, heres an updated verison: http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/3/
[06:22:14] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: whats a pseudo-selector?
[06:22:30] <Velveeta> sprkdev: that's because you're putting some permlink variable into the href, that's gonna cause it to behave like a regular link... transform this into a complete jsfiddle demo and i'll show you what to do
[06:22:55] <Velveeta> danig2k: the div:before is targeting an element that doesn't actually exist, the :before/:after pseudo classes target what are called pseudo elements
[06:23:05] <DaniG2k> ah i see
[06:23:08] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I changed that
[06:23:18] <Velveeta> oh ok, let me reload it then
[06:23:19] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: Im trying this: http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/4/
[06:23:21] <petzup> ok any other way to open/close div except toggle?
[06:23:23] <DaniG2k> still doesnt work
[06:23:36] <Velveeta> petzup: sure, you can manually write a toggle function to do it for you
[06:23:55] <SprkDev> http://jsfiddle.net/ftTfh/
[06:24:07] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: this is the effect I want to give it: http://jsfiddle.net/Hx65Q/8/
[06:25:56] <DaniG2k> wtf why wont this work :S
[06:26:20] <Velveeta> sprkdev: you want something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ftTfh/1/
[06:26:26] <Velveeta> danig2k: still looking into yours
[06:28:22] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: k
[06:28:25] <Velveeta> oh, it's because you can't pass parameters like that
[06:28:25] <DaniG2k> thx
[06:28:40] <Velveeta> if you're passing an options object, it expects to be the only parameter
[06:28:52] <Velveeta> it's throwing this exception in the console: Uncaught TypeError: Property '#<Object>' of object #<Object> is not a function
[06:29:11] <DaniG2k> :S
[06:29:39] <SprkDev> The problem I am having is the same as this guy had http://www.whiletrue.it/how-to-update-the-content-of-a-modal-in-twitter-bootstrap/
[06:29:40] <DaniG2k> what should it be?
[06:29:49] <Velveeta> well, i guess that's terrible information on my part
[06:29:51] <SprkDev> but it still won't work. The function ain't getting called. No allert box.
[06:29:58] <Velveeta> because your example clearly shows it doing just that
[06:30:07] <Velveeta> although it's with a different jquery version
[06:30:34] <SprkDev> I am working on two files for this problem.
[06:31:01] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: any insight as to how it should be instead?
[06:31:13] <Velveeta> danig2k: let me dig for another minute
[06:31:14] <SprkDev> one is author.php this is where I have put the #watchvideo boostrap div modal-content. the template forthe modal.
[06:31:21] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: thanks
[06:31:58] <SprkDev> the other is the single.php file. This is the external URL dom that is loaded into the modal . This modal placeholder is on the author.php page as I said above.
[06:32:31] <SprkDev> The modal shows. But it injects content only once. That's why I need the js function.
[06:32:46] <SprkDev> but I tried that thing in jsfiddle and it isnt calling funciton.
[06:32:50] <Velveeta> sprkdev: this demo works (now that i added jquery to it, and called a trigger('click') on the anchor: http://jsfiddle.net/ftTfh/2/
[06:33:01] <Velveeta> so if it's not working in your code, you have something else going on
[06:35:37] <SprkDev> okay something is happening. Only thing is that data-href is too generic so its loading on page load. How I change the selector to be called with this http://pastebin.com/3af1kKPC
[06:35:51] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I might be getting closer: http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/6/
[06:36:41] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/kfF5d/7/
[06:37:05] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: yea somethign like that
[06:37:07] <Velveeta> not sure why scoping it to the current item being clicked on helped, but it did.. that and adding jquery UI to the demo
[06:37:22] <Velveeta> to get the easeOutBounce easing
[06:37:35] <DaniG2k> but it doesnt seem to bounce :\
[06:37:47] <DaniG2k> it just fades in/out for me
[06:37:56] <Velveeta> sprkdev: to be called with what exactly? your php that defines the href?
[06:38:04] <Velveeta> just put that as the value of data-href instead of href
[06:38:31] <Velveeta> danig2k: that i don't have an answer for unfortunately
[06:40:07] <SprkDev> the boostrap modal calls the modal with the data-href attribute. But I have a number of modals. So is it possible to make those js function trigger only wi th this  http://pastebin.com/3af1kKPC
[06:41:49] <Velveeta> only with what, specifically?
[06:43:40] <SprkDev> so those function you beautifully wrote should be called, when I clicked that link. Can you bind it with #select or change href to data-href and bind it with that?
[06:43:45] <lianzinho> guys how to chain a .hasClass() ? like $('selector').hasClass('stuff').doSomething() ?
[06:44:00] <lianzinho> in the DOC it seems trivial, but does not work...
[06:44:37] <Velveeta> sprkdev: it already uses data-href internally, and binds to any anchor that has a data-href attribute, and when that anchor is clicked, only pulls the data-href attribute for that specific anchor
[06:45:00] <Velveeta> lianzinho: hasClass isn't chainable, it returns a boolean true/false value
[06:45:12] <lianzinho> Velveeta: what about this...
[06:45:21] <lianzinho> $( "p:first" ).hasClass( "selected" ).toString()
[06:45:32] <Velveeta> sure, that'll return a string representation of true or false
[06:45:35] <lianzinho> ah!
[06:45:39] <lianzinho> duh
[06:45:40] <lianzinho> hahahaha
[06:45:41] <SprkDev> ah okay. I think it is the load part that is the problem than. I want to load just a certain part. My single.php page and a certain div.
[06:45:45] <lianzinho> didn't see the result
[06:45:52] <lianzinho> stupid me
[06:46:06] <lianzinho> are there any similar chainable choices?
[06:46:10] <Velveeta> sprkdev: that's still doable using a data-href attribute
[06:46:19] <lianzinho> or I really need to write a if/else
[06:46:23] <lianzinho> *an
[06:46:31] <SprkDev> in my case that is data-href="<?php get_permalink() ?> #single-post"
[06:46:33] <Velveeta> lianzinho: not if you want a proper boolean evaluation for
[06:46:41] <Velveeta> sprkdev: that would work fine
[06:46:52] <SprkDev> where would I put that in the js function though?
[06:47:12] <Velveeta> you wouldn't put that in the js function, you would put it in the data-href attribute
[06:47:37] <Velveeta> lianzinho: here's one way you can do it
[06:47:42] <dwarder> i have a js object
[06:48:08] <Velveeta> lianzinho: $('selector').filter('.stuff').doSomething();
[06:48:17] <dwarder> how do i send literal value of myvar[sothing] as a post via   $.ajax({
[06:48:18] <dwarder>         type: 'POST',
[06:48:25] <Velveeta> that'll whittle that list down to just the items that match a stuff-classed selector
[06:48:31] <SprkDev> Okay yippee. seems to be working!
[06:48:32] <lianzinho> Velveeta: nice...
[06:48:48] <dwarder> so that the page to which i send it received myvar[something] equals to something
[06:49:13] <SprkDev> only one thing, I can see the transition for 1 sec, from old content in modal to new content. Can I do anything to spped that up, or hide old content till new content is loaded into modal?
[06:49:17] <dwarder> how do i form the object?
[06:49:25] <Velveeta> dwarder: do you mean you want send that the name of the value is myvar[something] also?
[06:49:42] <lianzinho> thanks, which one is faster? if/else I guess isn't it?
[06:49:58] <dwarder> Velveeta: right
[06:50:12] <Velveeta> sprkdev: you can speed it up by speeding up your server, or the internet... as for how to hide it instead, i'm not sure off the top of my head
[06:50:25] <dwarder> Velveeta: value myvar[something] equals to something
[06:50:30] <dwarder> Velveeta: not just something
[06:50:34] <dwarder> Velveeta: or myvar
[06:50:44] <Velveeta> lianzinho: they're functionally equivalent, if one is faster than the other, it won't be by human-noticeable amounts
[06:50:50] <SprkDev> you solution works. Only problem is it loads on page load as well.
[06:50:52] <Velveeta> dwarder: data: { myvar: myvar }
[06:51:03] <dwarder> Velveeta: no
[06:51:13] <Velveeta> sprkdev: that's because i added a .trigger('click') to it to manually fire it on dom load, just remove that part
[06:51:33] <dwarder> Velveeta: in post query i need a var to be myvar[myothervar] and a value for example 'myvalue'
[06:52:16] <Velveeta> dwarder: then you need to construct an object with a schema of var foo = { myothervar: value }; and pass data: { myvar: foo }
[06:52:31] <Velveeta> provided your original myvar variable already has that schema, then my original answer is correct
[06:53:10] <Cork> schema??
[06:53:16] <Cork> objects don't have schema...
[06:53:22] <Velveeta> if you just have 'value' that you want to pass as myvar.myothervar, then you can just pass it inline to $.ajax as data: { myvar: { myothervar: value } }
[06:53:36] <Velveeta> cork: that's what i call their data structure, since it's a recognizable term for most
[06:54:00] <Cork> Velveeta: scheama would be something you would have to update to add new values to the structure
[06:54:24] <Cork> Velveeta: like how you must update an sql table with a new column to add a new field
[06:54:43] <Velveeta> well, you kinda do, since var foo = { bar: true }; foo.baz: false; could be viewed as an update of the schema to add a new value
[06:54:50] <Cork> Velveeta: objects are like schema less databases (ex. mongodb) where you just add the values to the page that you want
[06:54:50] <anli_> What can cause using the scrollTop function will not change the scrollTop property of an element (its still 0)?
[06:54:59] <Velveeta> we're splitting hairs on semantics here though
[06:55:08] <Cork> Velveeta: no
[06:55:13] <Velveeta> yes
[06:55:25] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: still not working for me -_-...here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/7QFzv/
[06:55:29] <krambiorix> in a plugin, i want to execute a function... I have its name in a string , how can i execute it?
[06:55:29] <Cork> schema is something that limits what data you can add
[06:55:37] <Cork> that is the hole point of a schema
[06:55:42] <Velveeta> if somebody calls a true/false value a bit vs a boolean, it's a semantic difference
[06:56:12] <Cork> Velveeta: there is a schema lib you can use for json
[06:56:14] <Velveeta> not exactly, schema defines the structure of a piece of data, it doesn't necessarily limit it except in certain contexts
[06:56:29] <Velveeta> you can add mongoose to mongo to add schema, but it doesn't restrict the document structure
[06:56:29] <Cork> there is no schema support what so ever natively in js or json
[06:56:34] <Jattenalle> Velveeta, to be fair, most implementations of boolean nowadays just use an int, because it's so much faster and aligns well in memory
[06:56:44] <Velveeta> it only defines the schema of a record you pull out
[06:56:45] <Jattenalle> Velveeta, i do see your point though ;)
[06:57:27] <Velveeta> define schema (via google) shows this: "a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model"
[06:57:31] <Cork> Velveeta: as you never specify what will/can/should be allowed in the object, there just isn't any schema
[06:57:46] <Velveeta> i still say you're arguing semantics
[06:58:03] <Cork> well i would argue you call something something it isn't
[06:58:27] <SprkDev> A hand of applause and thank you to Velveeta. Cheers mate :-)
[06:58:28] <Cork> what you call schema in this case i would prob accept calling defaults
[06:58:52] <Velveeta> danig2k: http://jsfiddle.net/7QFzv/1/
[06:59:20] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you need to look up that function name in some kind of context to get a handle to the actual function, like window[functionname]()
[06:59:47] <Velveeta> cork: there is no default on object structure except what's defined on its prototype
[07:00:17] <Velveeta> damnit, i was supposed to get showered for work an hour ago :D
[07:00:59] <dwarder> Velveeta: i need a POST passed var to be myvar%5Banothevar%5B=myvalue
[07:01:12] <dwarder> wher %5B is [
[07:01:26] <Cork> Velveeta: you have the values you give the object when you create it
[07:01:33] <Velveeta> cork: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Schema_and_Metadata
[07:01:50] <Cork> Velveeta: yes, and that is a separate lib
[07:02:08] <Cork> Velveeta: you have an object you define what another object should/may include
[07:02:15] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ok, getting there thanks :)
[07:02:22] <dwarder> ValicekB: and %5D is ]
[07:02:28] <Velveeta> although in that case it's talking about the schema of json itself
[07:02:37] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: is there a way to not make that dropping div a list element?
[07:02:43] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: like to remove the number next to it
[07:02:50] <DaniG2k> otherwise it looks like it's a list element
[07:02:53] <Cork> dwarder: just give the data to data: in the ajax call
[07:03:28] <Cork> dwarder: { 'myvar[anothevar]': myvalue }
[07:03:33] <Velveeta> danig2k: if you want to remove the number next to it, you have to make your css more specific to not add that pseudo element to it
[07:03:53] <Cork> dwarder: or you might have to create an object if those are actually variables
[07:04:30] <krambiorix> Velveeta, hmmm window[afteraction]() doesn't work
[07:04:35] <Velveeta> dwarder: yeah, one question you need to answer is, do you want the actual *name* of the variable to be "myvar[anothervar]" or do you want it to be received as an object named myvar with a property named anothervar that you can reference
[07:04:53] <Velveeta> krambiorix: well that's because i don't know the context that your function lives in, i threw that out as an example
[07:05:04] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: off to lunch now, thanks a lot! I might be back later for some css-fu
[07:05:08] <DaniG2k> or jquery-fu
[07:05:09] <DaniG2k> thanks
[07:05:21] <Velveeta> danig2k: no problem, i may or may not be around, have a busy day today once i get in to work
[07:06:35] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: one more question
[07:06:43] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: when looking at the jsfille you linked me to
[07:06:47] <krambiorix> Velveeta, the function is in the same plugin
[07:06:47] <DaniG2k> I can't see any differences with my code
[07:06:54] <DaniG2k> what did you change to let it bounce like that?
[07:07:00] <Velveeta> krambiorix: try 'this' instead of 'window'
[07:07:19] <Velveeta> danig2k: i added a reference to jquery ui 1.9.2 in the external resources
[07:07:24] <krambiorix> Velveeta, so $(this).myfuntionname ?
[07:07:32] <Velveeta> krambiorix: no, this[functionname]
[07:07:49] <dwarder> Velveeta: i want it to be my actual name
[07:07:56] <Velveeta> krambiorix: that is, depending on how you have your object structured
[07:08:03] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: aaa. So it doesnt work with later versions?
[07:08:21] <Velveeta> dwarder: then go with what cork said: 'myvar[anothervar': value
[07:08:28] <Velveeta> er, with the ] on that too
[07:08:40] <dwarder> Cork: thank you but when i do my_data_var.var = {'var[var]':'somethingvalue'} it is not getting sent
[07:08:42] <Velveeta> danig2k: i don't know if it does or not, but you didn't have any version in there
[07:08:51] <DaniG2k> i see
[07:08:53] <Velveeta> and your example that you wanted to make it look like was using 1.9.2, so that's what i put in there
[07:09:07] <dwarder> Cork: other values assigned like this my_data_var.var = 'value'   are getting sent
[07:09:14] <krambiorix> Velveeta, nope doesn't work
[07:09:23] <Velveeta> dwarder: data: { 'var[anothervar]': 'somethingvalue' }
[07:09:33] <DaniG2k> k thanks
[07:09:34] <DaniG2k> im out
[07:09:43] <DRSK> uh when did you go all underground cork? :D sorry bout that I had no idea.
[07:09:48] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then that's as much as i can help you without seeing a demo of the code, because it's gonna have to be based on how your code is actually structured
[07:10:14] <Cork> DRSK: bug hunting something that adds a lot of junk in a database table
[07:10:16] <krambiorix> Velveeta, you mean in the plugin?
[07:10:17] <dwarder> Velveeta: i have a lot of such vars and i want to assign all such vars ('var[var]' etc ) to one object to use it ins data of ajax query
[07:10:21] <Velveeta> krambiorix: yes
[07:10:30] <dwarder> in*
[07:10:44] <Velveeta> dwarder: are you making an ajax request?
[07:10:48] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/Hv5nx/
[07:10:50] <Velveeta> using post?
[07:11:00] <DRSK> Cork » oh right that kinda sucks. i hope you find the culprit!
[07:11:13] <krambiorix> Velveeta, all functions are like  $.fn.showWarning = function(text,afteraction){...}; and all functions in (function( $ ) { FUNCTIONS  });
[07:11:16] <dwarder> Velveeta: right
[07:11:18] <dwarder> Velveeta: post
[07:11:31] <Velveeta> krambiorix: that's not enough, i need to see the code
[07:12:02] <Velveeta> dwarder: then you need to define your object using those types of keys, and pass it to $.post like cork's fiddle just shwoed
[07:12:05] <Velveeta> showed*
[07:12:33] <dwarder> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk3Lv/
[07:12:42] <dwarder> Cork: i have many such vars
[07:12:44] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i can say based on what you just said and how i'm interpreting that, that there's not a way to do what you're trying to do, with the way that code is written
[07:12:47] <krambiorix> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/1M7Tv117
[07:12:57] <Cork> dwarder: that isn't valid params
[07:12:59] <dwarder> Cork: am i creating this one holder object right?
[07:13:28] <Velveeta> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk3Lv/1/
[07:13:42] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk3Lv/2/
[07:13:55] <Cork> depending on what you need
[07:14:08] <Velveeta> krambiorix: where are the functions you mentioned?
[07:14:20] <Velveeta> this is just the plugin function with a call to .dialog
[07:14:21] <SprkDev> why is this not working now. It was worknig before. http://jsfiddle.net/FbtLy/
[07:14:38] <SprkDev> I want the url to change when I click the modal window. And return to normal when I close it.
[07:15:15] <krambiorix> Velveeta, below   http://pastebin.com/WK93PapZ  (nothing much)
[07:15:19] <anli_> What is a possible cause of this: foo.scrollTop(275); alert(foo.scrollTop()) outputs 0
[07:15:34] <anli_> foo has a parent and .width() is 300
[07:15:37] <anli_> oops
[07:15:38] <anli_> .height()
[07:15:42] <Velveeta> krambiorix: and you're passing what for the function name, the string "testie" ?
[07:15:44] <SprkDev> okay I fixed it somewhat.
[07:15:52] <krambiorix> Velveeta, yes
[07:16:02] <triyo> I have a $(window).scrollTop(0); in my code that is meant to take a user to the top of the screen after a user clicks a button and is directed to a different tab (bootstrap). It works, unless I click the button really fast, then it fails to scroll to the top.
[07:16:07] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then you need to look it up in the $.fn namespace, $.fn[functionname]
[07:16:10] <SprkDev> but now I have this problem. When I close the modal window, I have the black faded remaining.
[07:16:37] <dwarder> Cork: such vars aren't getting sent var my_object['v[b]'] = '100';   but such are sent var my_object['usual_var'] = '100';
[07:16:38] <Velveeta> krambiorix: and if you're trying to call that on an element, you're gonna need to do it with .call or .apply to pass that element as the context of the function
[07:17:03] <triyo> any particular reason this would occur? Is it that the button click interrupts the scrolling?
[07:17:35] <SprkDev> If fixed it.
[07:17:38] <Velveeta> triya: can you create a demo for us to show what's happening?
[07:17:52] <SprkDev> remvoed the this empty part
[07:18:37] <SprkDev> Now comes the final problem. My submit button does not work on the modal. and also the modal closes when I click the submit buton and nothing gets submitted.
[07:18:40] <triyo> Velveeta: hmm, I'll have to see how I can isolate this out of my oversized js file :-D
[07:19:15] <krambiorix> Velveeta, actually i want instead of the context, to pass some parameters...
[07:19:15] <Cork> dwarder: dwarder check the fiddle i gave you
[07:19:18] <DRSK> Cork » if you get a few moments to spare I'd like to hear your input on this :: http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/1/ <-- I'm stuck at line 40 really. I'm trying to make them come from the left. Stay in the middle while visible, and go out to the right. But whatever I do I can't seem to land it just right. I might be going about it the wrong way. Perhaps you could give me some advice? Lemme know if you get a minute or two.
[07:19:23] <Cork> dwarder: it is actually in the post list
[07:20:26] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i'm not sure what you mean by that... what you *should* be doing instead is passing that function by reference vs by name, but explain what you mean by passing some parameters
[07:20:40] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk3Lv/2/ send: v%5Ba%5D=10&v%5Bb%5D=100&v%5Bc%5D=1000
[07:20:40] <dwarder> Cork: yes, i used your vay to send data but my_object['v[b]'] = '100'; is not sent (i'm using network tab in google chrome debug console) and this my_object['vdd'] = '100'; is getting sent
[07:20:49] <krambiorix> Velveeta, so i can pass an array with parameters ( -> myparams[param1,param2] )and create a comma separated list to call testie  -> testi(param1,param2)
[07:21:09] <Cork> dwarder: check in your browsers network console
[07:21:29] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you can call a function and pass its parameters like that from an array of parameters using .apply().. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[07:21:42] <Cork> dwarder: well except i needed to remove the extra vars http://jsfiddle.net/Lk3Lv/3/
[07:21:48] <Cork> for got i did that
[07:24:01] <krambiorix> Velveeta, or is it possible to send the decission (button click in warning dialog) back to the first function call?
[07:24:09] <Velveeta> drsk: so right now it comes in from the right and goes out to the right.. you're saying you want that to slide in from the left instead, correct?
[07:24:35] <Velveeta> krambiorix: which first function call? i'm looking at an incomplete demo here, so you need to provide details
[07:24:41] <krambiorix> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/FLi0q5mk
[07:24:43] <DRSK> Velveeta » yes, apparently I'm applying the 'out' class before actually making it 'visible' and so due to that they're coming from the right. So I'm doing something troublesome right there.
[07:24:55] <krambiorix> Velveeta, is something like that possible?
[07:25:38] <DRSK> But, frankly, I'm not sure what to do about it. Trying to wrap my head around it but I'm without luck hence the idea to come here and ask for some advice on what I could possibly do better or.. yeah, perhaps even do something else entirely.
[07:25:56] <Velveeta> krambiorix: not the way you've written it there, you might want to refactor it to use a promise object instead
[07:26:31] <DRSK> Velveeta » http://jsfiddle.net/J5uXP/2/ <-- ... like that kinda
[07:26:57] <DRSK> I don't know what I did just now but erm yeah. It kinda does what I wanted it to do now :o
[07:26:58] <krambiorix> Velveeta, what would be the best way to use a genereric message alert (" Are you sure you want to....")   in a dialog?
[07:27:17] <Velveeta> drsk: ok, so that looks like what you described, is that good enough, or are you still trying to tweak that?
[07:27:38] <Velveeta> krambiorix: if you don't need special styling, you can do it with a standard javascript confirm dialog
[07:27:43] <DRSK> Velveeta » actually, if you could just skim through it and perhaps give some advice on it I'd really appreciate it. I feel like I kinda.. got lucky just now ;p
[07:27:53] <Velveeta> krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.confirm
[07:28:08] <Velveeta> drsk: lol, no problem
[07:28:21] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[07:28:38] <krambiorix> Velveeta, hmmm no not those confirm boxes...
[07:28:39] <dwarder> Cork: the value that i test was the only one that is undefined
[07:28:50] <dwarder> Cork: so that is why i confused myslef
[07:28:58] <Cork> heh
[07:29:01] <Cork> ya, that happens
[07:29:10] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then what you're talking about is gonna be an asynchronous user input operation, you're gonna want to investigate using promises as part of that
[07:30:51] <Velveeta> drsk: a couple things i would recommend are that you have some extraneous variable declarations here that you could do away with
[07:30:55] <krambiorix> Velveeta, thanks, i'll look into that
[07:31:17] <Velveeta> drsk: let me rework this a little bit
[07:31:44] <DRSK> Velveeta » thanks for looking at it, I appreciate it!
[07:32:05] <SprkDev> why doesn't my form work in modal?
[07:34:16] <DRSK> Velveeta » as you said earlier, the idea is to have the boxes come from the left. Stay put in the middle while they're "active" and gtfo to the right. And on line 14 or whatnot I am trying to do a fallback for when we cant' use transforms or transitions.
[07:34:17] <NoiseEee> SprkDev: i give up
[07:34:42] <SprkDev> ?
[07:34:49] <NoiseEee> SprkDev: what doesnt work? where is a fiddle / a code sample?  the #jquery crystal ball is still out of order
[07:34:51] <DRSK> talk about specificity
[07:35:33] <SprkDev> wanterd to know generally, do form submission work in bootstrap modal?
[07:35:53] <warhol> I'm trying to load a modal on a separate (relative) page after a form submission. what would be the best callback situation to do this. I've been trying window.location.href but haven't been able to get a callback working after that.
[07:36:30] <SprkDev> also is it possible to called two javascript functions onclick a
[07:37:48] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: Are you trying anything before you ask?
[07:38:06] <SprkDev> yes I have.
[07:38:25] <BillCriswell> What did you try for the two functions onclick?
[07:39:51] <Velveeta> drsk: ok, here's some initial cleanup, i renamed self to $this because i think it's more descriptive of what it represents, got rid of some unnecessarily variable declaration, used some predefined variables in places they weren't being used, switched one instance of direct binding to use delegation instead
[07:40:44] <dawkirst> What is the common reason for not being able to select anything inside my function, while when I do the same selection in the console, it selects just fine?
[07:41:04] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: You're not waiting for the document to be ready.
[07:41:36] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, should $(function() {} not suffice?
[07:41:51] <BillCriswell> That should yes.
[07:41:58] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Are you loading something via ajax?
[07:42:03] <SprkDev> okay how can I send form submission thru ajax or jquery?
[07:42:14] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, yes.
[07:42:30] <DRSK> Velveeta » wow yes that looks much cleaner. Thank you! I had no idea you could do it like that on line 38. !! ?
[07:42:36] <Velveeta> warhol: typically if you want to trigger some kind of callback in another page, after it's loaded, you have to either use some kind of cookie or else embed something in the url that the other page looks for
[07:42:36] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: That's why then. You would need to select things after the things are loaded.
[07:42:38] <DRSK> notnot = is ?
[07:42:41] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Are you using load?
[07:43:01] <Velveeta> drsk: yep, good ol' not-not, the equivalent (in that case) of .length > 0
[07:43:14] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, nope.
[07:43:16] <DRSK> oh thank you, that's really useful!
[07:43:19] <Velveeta> not-not just means flip the logic, then flip it again
[07:43:30] <Velveeta> so truthy flips to false back to true
[07:43:36] <Velveeta> and falsey flips to true back to false
[07:43:45] <warhol> ok thanks @Velveeta
[07:44:02] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, $.ajax.
[07:44:02] <DRSK> Velveeta » I kinda figured that, and guessed it. But I wasn't sure. Thanks for clarifying :) Have you got any idea what I can do with line 14 etc? E.g. a left/right case?
[07:44:33] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Ok, so when that's done is when you'd select the new elements.
[07:44:50] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: You may not need to do that though, what's your intention with those newly loaded elements?
[07:45:13] <Velveeta> drsk: so i see 2 different function chains in that block, one goes .show().stop() and the other is just .stop(), should they both be doing .show().stop() or is it really a different case for each?
[07:45:44] <DRSK> Velveeta » I'm guessing .stop() on both directions horizontally, as in left/right
[07:45:44] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, trying, I simply get an empty object (length == 0). I don't have any intention with them, literally just trying to wrap my head around jQuery.
[07:46:06] <Velveeta> drsk: right, but should .show() be done on both, or is this more of a show/hide kind of toggle? it looks like it's a toggle
[07:46:34] <DRSK> Velveeta » looking for the same 'functionality' as you just saw, but made with animate instead. I think that's like a toggle tho right?
[07:46:36] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Ok, then it would be something like... $.ajax({url:'foo.html'}).done(function(){ /* Now you can query things loaded from foo.html */ });
[07:46:49] <Velveeta> oh ok gotcha, as the fallback for a lack of css transitions
[07:47:08] <Velveeta> but you want it on left/right or up/down? because it's written with up/date
[07:47:09] <DRSK> Velveeta » well, that was the plan but if it's a poor implementation I'd like to hear how I could've done it better
[07:47:11] <Velveeta> er up/down
[07:47:26] <DRSK> Velveeta » yeah I did this up/down first, but then I changed my mind and so that's left from back when'
[07:47:29] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, thanks, let me dumb down my piece of code to just that and see if I succeed (and then try to figure out what's wrong with my existing piece of code).
[07:47:40] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Good plan.
[07:48:09] <Velveeta> billcriswell: you know what else is a good plan? saving 15% or more on your car insurance
[07:48:25] <SprkDev> What do I put for url, if my url is the same file? http://jsfiddle.net/7L8eg/
[07:48:33] <DRSK> how about none?
[07:48:51] <DRSK> oh right ignore that, didn't even look =)
[07:49:14] <bengalo> your url is in the same file?
[07:49:29] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That is an excellent plan.
[07:50:20] <SprkDev> yes
[07:50:40] <SprkDev> I doing the script in the same file. So what do I put in the url for that expression for ajax
[07:50:43] <SprkDev> ?
[07:51:13] <bengalo> check window.location
[07:52:05] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/63g6U/  all functions on the callback of createDiagnosticoOrto() are ajax requests. How can i redirect or make an alert ONLY after the ajax are over ?
[07:52:43] <Cork> xnotte: return the jqxhr object from the ajax call
[07:52:44] <bengalo> your ajax calls are deferred objects, so you can use a .done(yourstuffhere)
[07:53:06] <Cork> xnotte: and use $.when(call1, call2, call3).done(function() {})
[07:53:40] <Elirips> Hello. How can I modify an existing CSS-class that is definied from a css-file using jquery?
[07:53:50] <Cork> Elirips: you can't
[07:54:00] <Elirips> Cork: thx
[07:54:09] <Cork> Elirips: there is plugins that can help you with it though
[07:54:19] <Cork> or you can fiddle with document.styleSheets
[07:54:22] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: http://jsbin.com/tidukosi/3/edit?js,output Here is a very basic demo. I wouldn't do things exactly this way but just to demonstrate how you'd select an element added through Ajax.
[07:54:39] <seutje> oh man, document.styleSheets fiddling is so damn annoying to do
[07:54:44] <BillCriswell> Elirips: Just overwrite the rules from the css file in your own stylesheet.
[07:54:48] <Cork> seutje: true
[07:54:50] <Velveeta> yeah, please don't go that route
[07:54:57] <Cork> Elirips: note though changing stylesheet data is very slow
[07:55:05] <seutje> yeah, that as well
[07:55:09] <Cork> and you should prob find another way doing it
[07:55:16] <Velveeta> most people that want to modify css classes directly only want to because they don't realize there are better ways of doing what they're trying to do
[07:55:25] <Cork> ya
[07:55:46] <krambiorix> Velveeta, i implemented this: http://icanmakethiswork.blogspot.be/2013/11/rolling-your-own-confirm-mechanism.html   -> works like a charm
[07:55:49] <krambiorix> Velveeta, thanks!!
[07:56:10] <Elirips> Maybe. What I would like to do: I'm using jquery ui tab-thing. I would like to make a selected tab have a bold-font, so I thought about modifying 'ui-tabs-selected', but I do not want to modify it in the jquery source
[07:56:12] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, thanks. While I look at that, would you mind looking at https://gist.github.com/9763497?
[07:56:16] <Elirips> What would be the best way to do so?
[07:56:18] <Velveeta> krambiorix: sounds good
[07:56:31] <Cork> Elirips: just define a selector in your own css file
[07:56:35] <Velveeta> right
[07:56:36] <bengalo> krambiorix it loads forever over here, jfyi
[07:56:38] <Elirips> Cork: ok
[07:56:40] <Cork> Elirips: and lost tha selector after the default one
[07:56:44] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: You can't get to div.bar reliably outside of that success function.
[07:56:47] <Cork> Elirips: and it will override the values you add
[07:56:55] <Cork> *with the values you add
[07:57:14] <Elirips> Cork: does my css have to be added later?
[07:57:15] <bengalo> krambiorix not anymore :>
[07:57:25] <xnotte> Cork: i don't have jqxhr, let me check whats that. I have to add it to "createpatologia(), etc" right ? updated: http://jsfiddle.net/63g6U/1/
[07:57:28] <Cork> Elirips: later or it has to be more specific
[07:57:33] <Elirips> hmm
[07:57:35] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Er you can, but not with the elements loaded through ajax.
[07:57:51] <Elirips> I'm loading the ui-thing dynamically later (when its used), but I load my styles at the very beginning
[07:57:52] <Cork> Elirips: last selector that is the most specific is the one that wins
[07:58:04] <Elirips> luckely, there's !important
[07:58:10] <Cork> no
[07:58:14] <Cork> don't use important
[07:58:18] <Elirips> just joking, :P
[07:58:25] <dawkirst> Ok, because elsewhere it selects fine, that's why it's confusing me.
[07:58:28] <Cork> Elirips: and just load the css when the page loads
[07:58:51] <Elirips> Well, thanks everyone for the help
[07:58:56] <Cork> Elirips: you actually trigger a full page reflow when you add a stylesheet to the page
[07:59:08] <Cork> so you kinda want that when you don't have any content
[07:59:10] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: You can't select .bar outside of the success callback, so therefore you couldn't access .foo with .bar reliably outside of the success callback.
[07:59:11] <bengalo> xnotte just return the ajax call, then your functions are also deferred and u can use the when as pointed out above
[07:59:19] <Elirips> Cork: thats a good note
[07:59:33] <bengalo> make your functions return $.ajax ... is what i mean
[07:59:45] <krambiorix> bengalo, ? you tried the example?
[07:59:46] <xnotte> bengalo: like var x = $ajax.... ? return x ?
[07:59:57] <Elirips> So, that means, every time a "control" wroten by me, that loads its css and js while the page is already on screen, it will reflow everything once the css gets parsed by the browser?
[08:00:20] <bengalo> yeah, or just function foo () { return $.ajax(... }
[08:00:39] <bengalo> krambiorix i tried loading it, but it wouldnt at first
[08:00:47] <bengalo> then it did but it was just loads of dialogs ;)
[08:00:58] <Velveeta> xnotte: yes, but you can skip the variable assignment also, and just do: return $.ajax(options);
[08:01:03] <krambiorix> bengalo, ow ok
[08:01:07] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, what do you mean by "access .foo with .bar"?
[08:01:11] <Cork> xnotte: http://jsfiddle.net/63g6U/2/
[08:01:32] <Cork> that will work if you return the value from $.ajax from those functions
[08:01:41] <BillCriswell> You can't get .foo with .bar inside of it outside of the success callback reliably.
[08:01:59] <xnotte> Velveeta ok thanks
[08:02:36] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, ok, I think that makes sense.
[08:03:22] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Keep in mind not having direct access to .bar doesn't mean you can't work with it depending on what you need to do. Event delegation is a beautiful thing.
[08:03:26] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, last thing: what do you mean with "reliably". Does that imply it will sometimes work, but other times not?
[08:03:35] <xnotte> Cork, Velveeta : like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/63g6U/3/  Shouldn't i return in savepatologias either ?
[08:04:02] <Velveeta> yes to both questions
[08:04:04] <Cork> xnotte: you need to return all the way to the when call
[08:04:22] <Velveeta> savePatologias should return createpatologia(listapatolblahblahblah)
[08:04:52] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: There is a chance it can work . If you were to put a shitload of time consuming code between the ajax call and you're querying of it you *may* get it, that's why you need the callback.
[08:05:25] <xnotte> Velveeta: can i "return function()" ? "return createpatologias()" ?
[08:05:26] <bengalo> Velveeta so a "normal" function handles the deferreds without being one itself? didnt know that either
[08:05:36] <Velveeta> xnotte: yep
[08:05:45] <xnotte> ok thank you
[08:05:51] <xnotte> Thanks Cork
[08:06:06] <xnotte> let me change and check
[08:06:08] <Velveeta> bengalo: not sure what you mean by that, you mean fetching a deferred from a function return?
[08:06:46] <bengalo> i thought when would think that the savePatologias is resolved instantly
[08:06:52] <bengalo> but its just passing the deferred obv
[08:07:05] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, ah ok. So. Say I do want to select .bar, how can I do that in way that is good practice (you mentioned event delegation)?
[08:07:50] <Velveeta> yes, the function call would execute immediately and return fairly immediately, but wouldn't be completed immediately, it would return the promise from $.ajax, which would be incorporated into that $.when call, so that $.when's callback would be executed once all of those promises were resolved
[08:08:43] <BillCriswell> If you want to select .bar directly you'll need to wait for it, but say you wanted to do something when it's interacted with like a click, you can do $('.foo').on('click', '.bar', doSomething); and since .foo is waiting for a .bar to trigger that event you don't need to wait to attach those events.
[08:08:50] <bengalo> yeah, i was writing weird when constructs so far when dealing with a function calling several other deferred so far
[08:09:18] <bengalo> that will cut it down by quite a bit
[08:09:21] <BillCriswell> If you want .bar though you'd have to just do it after the .append() in the success callback.
[08:10:08] <bengalo> oh
[08:10:20] <bengalo> he isnt even, sigh
[08:11:10] <bengalo> well, then i may be right about doing what i do when my savePatologias would have to return the deferred of multiple calls
[08:11:21] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, ok, let me just try to assimilate all of that.
[08:13:59] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: http://jsbin.com/tidukosi/4/edit?js,output This might help a bit.
[08:14:44] <BillCriswell> The setInterval is just used to fake the delay of a crazy delayed ajax request.
[08:14:56] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, thanks!
[08:15:19] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:20:10] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, so in that example, $user (the ul) is listening for the click event, but deferring it to the li?
[08:20:44] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, maybe "deferring" is the wrong word. Delegating rather?
[08:21:01] <BillCriswell> Delegating sounds more right... to be honest I am terrible with words.
[08:22:07] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, thanks. I think the thing that really gets to me now is that I have to idea to separate concerns (a la MVC). Wouldn't all those callbacks lead to an insane mess of code?
[08:23:12] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: It can depending on how organized you keep the callbacks I am sure.
[08:23:38] <krambiorix> Velveeta, you're still there?
[08:23:44] <Velveeta> yessir
[08:24:11] <krambiorix> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/DjiimTGJ    ?
[08:24:47] <Velveeta> ok?
[08:25:03] <dawkirst> Ok, so in my example success was a callback, right? Can I simulate that kind of thing with my own callbacks, or what exactly do you mean with callbacks?
[08:25:27] <krambiorix> Velveeta, i put the question below the code
[08:25:53] <Velveeta> how can you pass it where?
[08:26:33] <krambiorix> Velveeta, see where console.dir(w); is
[08:26:36] <Velveeta> yeah
[08:26:56] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, guess I don't totally get callbacks yet. I thought those were a special last argument for some functions that is a function itself.
[08:27:09] <xnotte> Cork, Velveeta : It worked. Thank you
[08:27:18] <Velveeta> xnotte: awesome, good to hear
[08:27:35] <Velveeta> krambiorix: are you asking how to pass w to console.dir?
[08:27:42] <Velveeta> because you're already doing it
[08:28:11] <krambiorix> Velveeta, console.dir(w)  is empty.... So the parameter didn't pass
[08:28:30] <Velveeta> the parameter passed just fine...... but are you actually receiving it in your .then() callback?
[08:28:53] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, will baz() be an example of a callback? https://gist.github.com/emilesilvis/9764206
[08:29:14] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, and is that a "good" way to do it?
[08:29:18] <Velveeta> dawkirst: not unless you pass it into success
[08:29:25] <Velveeta> otherwise it's just a function call
[08:29:59] <Velveeta> callbacks are meant to be something variable that you pass to a function to be executed when some defined point in the function is hit
[08:30:07] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Yeah, baz is just a function. Sorry was reading something.
[08:30:25] <Velveeta> similar to how you could do something like this: $(element).show('slow', function () { alert('see me now?'); })
[08:30:46] <Velveeta> you could pass any function as that 2nd parameter, and it would be executed as the callback
[08:30:52] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, Velveeta ok, brb (I'm really keen to wrap my head around this, and I'm feeling that I'm on the verge of snapping it).
[08:30:53] <krambiorix> Velveeta, it's empty in the els{}
[08:30:55] <krambiorix> *else
[08:31:18] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then it's not being received by your .then() callback is what i'm trying to tell you
[08:31:45] <Velveeta> or it's being received, but in an empty state
[08:31:50] <krambiorix> Velveeta, any idea what i can do ?
[08:32:01] * Velveeta sighs.
[08:32:06] <Velveeta> again, not without seeing your code
[08:32:08] <Velveeta> we're not magicians
[08:32:49] <krambiorix> Velveeta, i gave it to you, no,
[08:33:08] <Velveeta> you gave me about 20 lines of code that consisted of a callback to some confirm dialog you wrote
[08:33:20] <Velveeta> but without seeing the code for that confirm dialog, i don't know what gets passed to your callback
[08:34:45] <krambiorix> Velveeta, ow you mean that i have to pass that parameter to my confirmWarning function too?
[08:35:06] <Velveeta> no, it needs to be passed *from* your confirmWarning
[08:35:31] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, Velveeta so am I right in assuming that any parameter that is passed to a function that is a function is a callback, and will be executed?
[08:35:40] <Velveeta> you call confirmWarning, which does what it does and returns a promise... when that promise is resolved, it needs to be resolved with both the confirmed state, as well as whatever 'w' is supposed to be
[08:36:08] <krambiorix> Velveeta, yes but the function confirmWarning doesn't know what w is
[08:36:14] <Velveeta> dawkirst: any functional parameter passed to a function is considered a callback, but won't be executed unless you specifically xecute it
[08:36:41] <jason___> hello
[08:36:44] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i don't know what w is either, you've given me no context on what it is in that code example, you just threw it into your parameter list... it's gotta come from somewhere
[08:37:20] <dawkirst> Velveeta, so if I do .success(data, baz), baz won't be executed? (baz as a named function as opposed to an anonymous one)
[08:37:47] <Velveeta> dawkirst: not unless that success function executes it itself, right
[08:37:49] <jason___> how could i find ben_alman ?
[08:38:06] <krambiorix> Velveeta, http://jsfiddle.net/3zj9v/
[08:38:08] <Velveeta> jason___ he's right here in the room list, congratulations, you found him
[08:38:15] <bengalo> wtf really
[08:38:50] <BillCriswell> Uh oh.
[08:38:59] <jason___> well im trying to contact him but dont know how to private message him in
[08:38:59] <Velveeta> krambiorix: in that case, w is defined in the closure scope that your confirmWarning callback already has access to, you don't need to receive it in your parameter list.. by receiving it like you're doing, you're overwriting w in the local scope with an undefined value
[08:39:13] <BillCriswell> dawkirst: Sounds about right to me.
[08:39:25] <Velveeta> jason___ that's gonna depend on your irc client, but you can try: /msg ben_alman <your message>
[08:40:13] <bengalo> hello everyone, i want it to make 5.9 from 59, how can i do anyone know
[08:40:40] * Velveeta facepalms.
[08:40:42] <Velveeta> :D
[08:40:45] <jason___> anyone know how to use simple php proxy?
[08:40:47] <krambiorix> Velveeta, oooow damn, it's true
[08:40:47] <BillCriswell> bengalo: Did you include the javascript plugin in jQuery?
[08:40:48] <bengalo> :>
[08:40:52] <Velveeta> jason___ wrong channel
[08:40:53] <bengalo> ofc!
[08:41:04] <jason___> velveeta what channel should i go to?
[08:41:11] <Velveeta> something php-related?
[08:41:21] <BillCriswell> jason___: ##php more than likely.
[08:41:25] <BillCriswell> /j ##php
[08:41:30] <jason___> yeah its a script ben alman has made
[08:41:35] <BillCriswell> Just type that... might need to me registered.
[08:41:36] <jason___> thats why im looking for him
[08:41:47] <Velveeta> well, you can send him a message like i showed you
[08:41:57] <Velveeta> and/or try a php-related channel
[08:42:16] <jason___> thank you velveeta
[08:42:20] <Velveeta> no problemo
[08:43:45] <BillCriswell> I'm reading "People Skills For Web Developers" but the only people I occasionally have an issue talking to is other Web Developers haha.
[08:44:33] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, Velveeta, so are you saying that callbacks is a jQuery-specific thing? As in http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_callback.asp?
[08:44:48] <bengalo> well, keep a couple of extra copies with you and hand them out in weird situations
[08:44:54] <Velveeta> nope, i was just using jquery as an example of callbacks, since they're commonly used
[08:45:03] <BillCriswell> No no. Just a callback is a function that's run after something is done.
[08:45:08] <Velveeta> callbacks in general are just a development pattern, used in a variety of languages
[08:45:42] <Velveeta> dawkirst: i'll whip up a fiddle example to demonstrate
[08:46:05] <dawkirst> Velveeta, that would be excellent.
[08:48:17] <jasperbollen> Hello
[08:48:35] <jasperbollen> I have a question according jquery .load in comination with jquery ui
[08:49:02] <jasperbollen> Can anybody help me with that?
[08:49:17] <tandroid> jasperbollen:  Just ask the question
[08:49:59] <jasperbollen> Thx, when i load a page with .load() function, all javascripts on that loaded page work (if set between script type is taxt/javascript tags)
[08:50:07] <jasperbollen> Thought the jquery ui functions dont work anymore
[08:50:14] <jasperbollen> like datepicker or autocomplete
[08:50:18] <jasperbollen> though*
[08:51:15] <tandroid> jasperbollen: Can you post the code?
[08:51:38] <jasperbollen> Sure, im loading the page with this:
[08:51:40] <jasperbollen> var link = "/actionhandlers/note.php?id="+PageId;
[08:51:40] <jasperbollen> 		 $("#action").load(link);
[08:51:43] <jasperbollen> This works correct
[08:52:24] <tandroid> Would you mind using something like jsbin or jsfiddle?
[08:52:35] <jasperbollen> the code on the loaded page = <div class="loaded_wrapper">
[08:52:36] <jasperbollen> 	<div class="loaded_title">

[08:53:19] <jasperbollen> oh sure
[08:53:20] <jasperbollen> 1 moment
[08:53:20] <BillCriswell> How do those excess flood things work?
[08:53:21] <jasperbollen> woops :$
[08:53:27] <DaniG2k> can anyone figure out why the heck I can't get this jquery to bounce properly? and to work in my rails app?
[08:53:30] <DaniG2k> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22637219/jquery-not-bouncing-a-div-properly?noredirect=1#comment34478806_22637219
[08:53:41] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: only if the paste comes fast, most clients have a protection for that nowadays
[08:53:50] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Got it.
[08:54:17] <Velveeta> ok dawkirst, here's an example to hopefully explain things: http://jsfiddle.net/MfRU3/
[08:54:26] <Uhkis> jasperbollen: please never do that again anywhere
[08:54:35] <jasperbollen> Sorry, i dont use irc alot
[08:54:47] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I'm baaaack :P
[08:55:01] <Velveeta> "BillCriswell Sweet jesus." -- lol
[08:55:14] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: same problem. It doesnt seem to work in my rails app I have no idea whats going on
[08:55:30] <Velveeta> danig2k: what was your issue again?
[08:55:44] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22637219/jquery-not-bouncing-a-div-properly?noredirect=1#comment34478806_22637219
[08:55:47] <Velveeta> would it be wrong of me to say rails is the problem? :D
[08:55:50] <DaniG2k> are you an angel?
[08:55:56] <DaniG2k> just helping people @_@
[08:55:59] * Velveeta puts on his robe and wizard hat.
[08:56:03] <DaniG2k> or mother teresa perhaps
[08:56:18] <Velveeta> mother teresa was a pretty horrible person..... she was no mother teresa :D
[08:56:23] <DaniG2k> lol
[08:56:31] <dawkirst> Velveeta, thanks, much appreciated!
[08:56:43] <Velveeta> dawkirst: no problem, let me know if you still have questions
[08:56:51] <dawkirst> Velveeta, will do.
[08:57:33] <Velveeta> danig2k: are you including a portion of jquery ui to define that easeOutBounce easing?
[08:57:52] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I am including jquery and jquery_ujs
[08:58:09] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what jquery_ujs is.... are you getting an errors in your console?
[08:58:15] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: no errors
[08:58:44] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tour-of-rails-jquery-ujs
[08:59:03] <Velveeta> yeah i'm reading the github page for the project right now
[08:59:28] <Velveeta> so, previously, when i tried using the easeOutBounce easing with your code snippet, i was getting an error in the console that about easing function being undefined
[08:59:38] <Velveeta> until i threw jqui into your fiddle
[08:59:57] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: when I try to even click this div, nothign happens. No console errors, nothing
[09:00:33] <dawkirst> Velveeta, that is an excellent example, really appreciate it! Thanks :)
[09:00:39] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ah ok
[09:00:41] <dawkirst> BillCriswell, thanks to you too!
[09:00:42] <Velveeta> danig2k: is there an actual url i can see it in action?
[09:00:44] <DaniG2k> I restarted the server
[09:00:51] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:00:52] <Velveeta> dawkirst: no problem :)
[09:01:06] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I am getting TypeError: jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[09:01:11] <Velveeta> there ya go
[09:01:37] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: this refers to the list element
[09:01:43] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ol.rounded-list li
[09:01:50] <Velveeta> you should be able to add a minimal chunk of jqui without adding the whole thing, in order to define that easing function
[09:02:03] <Velveeta> hmmm
[09:02:33] <Velveeta> this inside of your callback refers to that, but the error you pointed out is coming from a different function
[09:02:34] <jasperbollen> This is kinda my situation, hope it makes sense
[09:02:35] <jasperbollen> http://jsfiddle.net/545RH/
[09:02:49] <jasperbollen> Its very simple code, though it doesn’t seem to work
[09:03:27] <Velveeta> jasperbollen: you're wrapping that datepicker instantiation in a document.ready, but if you're loading the content via .load(), it's not available at document.ready time
[09:03:39] <Velveeta> you need to be instantiating datepicker in a success callback to your load function call
[09:03:57] <jasperbollen> Hmm, and how exactly?
[09:04:35] <Velveeta> wherever you're doing your .load(), do something like this: $(someElement).load(url, function () { $('#activity_date").datepicker(yourOptions); })
[09:05:04] <jasperbollen> ah ok, let me try that out, 1 moment
[09:05:18] <Velveeta> or you can chain off of its promise like this: $(someElement).load(url).done(function () { $("activity_date").datepicker(options); })
[09:05:54] <jasperbollen> Allright! thanks, gonna try that
[09:10:05] <jasperbollen> if i do it like this, the enite load functions doenst work
[09:10:06] <jasperbollen> $("#action").load(link).done(function () { $("#activity_date").datepicker(); });
[09:13:10] <jasperbollen> If i do it like this, the load() works, the datepicker doesnt
[09:13:25] <jasperbollen>  $("#action").load(link, function () {	$("#activity_date").datepicker({dateFormat: "dd-mm-yy"  	}); 	 });
[09:13:26] <Velveeta> what version of jquery are you running?
[09:14:06] <jasperbollen> latest
[09:14:12] <jasperbollen> code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[09:14:18] <jasperbollen> jquery ui 1.10.4
[09:15:07] <Velveeta> is there an error being thrown with the first method, using .done() ?
[09:15:17] <Velveeta> or w/ the 2nd one using a callback?
[09:15:45] <jasperbollen> no, just nothing happends @ the first one, at the second also no error, the load() functions works there though
[09:15:45] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I think I've found the culprit
[09:15:59] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: if I do .toggle("slide") it works fine
[09:16:00] <Velveeta> danig2k: who's behind it all?
[09:16:20] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: if I do .toggle("slide", {easing: 'easeOutBounce'}); it fails
[09:16:23] <Velveeta> jasperbollen: that's weird, both of those should work fine
[09:16:40] <Velveeta> danig2k: right.. because that easing function hasn't been defined yet
[09:16:52] <Velveeta> that's what i've been trying to tell you
[09:17:05] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: where is it supposed to get defined?
[09:17:12] <Velveeta> as part of jquery ui
[09:17:28] <Velveeta> you have to find the right portion of jquery ui to load to define that, unless you want to just load the whole thing
[09:17:35] <DaniG2k> i see
[09:17:40] <DaniG2k> 1 sec, brb
[09:17:49] <krambiorix> when i select a div via class , does it also select hidden divs?
[09:18:14] <bengalo> sure
[09:18:22] <bengalo> everything that the class matches
[09:20:13] <jasperbollen> in fact if i even use .done at all nothing happens
[09:20:54] <Velveeta> jasperbollen: can you post an updated portion of your code, or point us to a url we can see it in action?
[09:21:03] <jasperbollen> sure, 1 moment
[09:29:35] <krambiorix> does the trigger "focusout" also triggers the "change" ?
[09:30:01] <duch_kazatel> nope.  2 different events.
[09:30:52] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, thanks
[09:38:09] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: ok so
[09:38:16] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: I added jquery-easing-rails to my application
[09:38:25] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: which should include the easing functions
[09:38:39] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: but it's still not working -_- fml...no errors in the console
[09:39:07] <Velveeta> that's a little out of my league then, without being able to see it not working in context
[09:39:12] <Velveeta> i'm not a rails person
[09:39:34] <DaniG2k> i see
[09:41:07] <duch_kazatel> i feel like the rails asset pipeline is way more confusing than it needs to be.
[09:41:12] <duch_kazatel> i see problems in here constantly with it.
[09:42:33] <Velveeta> i blame the language itself... when in doubt: rails.
[09:43:07] <DaniG2k> rails is a very nice web application framework
[09:43:11] <DaniG2k> the best ive worked with to be honest
[09:43:21] <DaniG2k> django makes me cry
[09:43:27] <duch_kazatel> hah, i love django.
[09:43:29] <DaniG2k> lets not even go into php frameworks
[09:43:54] <_rgn> is there way to make mouse event not register certain elements
[09:44:04] <_rgn> maybe a css property
[09:44:12] <duch_kazatel> _rgn clarify what your problem is.
[09:44:18] <duch_kazatel> because that's a strange thing to want to do.
[09:44:21] <_rgn> i know i can use ev.target
[09:44:36] <BillCriswell> _rgn: There's pointer-events: none; but it's pretty new.
[09:44:44] <_rgn> but right now it would be easier if certain elements would never be ev.target
[09:45:12] <duch_kazatel> _rgn sounds like you're trying to make a modal maybe?
[09:45:13] <NoiseEee> _rgn: what
[09:45:21] <Velveeta> _rgn: you can use a :not() selector to bind your listeners to
[09:45:40] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: would you know what css i need to modify to remove the 2 that appears next to the drop down : http://jsfiddle.net/7QFzv/3/
[09:45:42] <Velveeta> like $('div:not(.someClassYouWantToIgnore)').on('mousemove', callback)
[09:46:49] <BillCriswell> _rgn: http://jsbin.com/polif/9/ here's a demo for pointer-events: none; It's really helpful on a touch screen.
[09:47:26] <duch_kazatel> _rgn can you explain what you're really trying to do?  is it a modal or a nav or something?
[09:47:34] <Velveeta> danig2k: http://jsfiddle.net/7QFzv/4/
[09:47:37] <_rgn> thanks
[09:47:46] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: hmmm well that number is occuring automatically with a css counter
[09:47:48] <Velveeta> i added an enumerate class to the div you *want* to enumerate, and changed the css to target it
[09:48:13] <_rgn> duch_kazatel: basically a div with draggable background and some of the content as ev.target should still drag the background while other should not
[09:48:15] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
[09:48:23] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: oops, caps
[09:48:31] <Velveeta> wingardium enumerata
[09:48:38] <no_gravity> Strange, on my ipad, $("body").click(somefunction); never fires, no matter where i click.
[09:48:42] <no_gravity> Any ideas why?
[09:48:59] <_rgn> basically i've solved this problem the other way around by having a whitelist of elements that should drag the background
[09:49:00] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: hehehe no seriously what did you change?
[09:49:05] <Velveeta> no_gravity: it's because of how the ipad's safari is dumb
[09:49:14] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: the css is identical
[09:49:21] <DaniG2k> Velveeta: the html is identical
[09:49:21] <Velveeta> if you put a click event on just the body, it rarely if ever fires
[09:49:36] <Velveeta> you want to put a div or something wrapping everything inside the body, and put your click handler on that instead
[09:49:53] <no_gravity> Velveeta: hmm... i would like to trap EVERY click outside a certain element.
[09:50:04] <Velveeta> danig2k: they're not, i told you, i added an enumerate class to the div you wanted to target, and added that to your :before pseudo-selector to target it
[09:50:11] <no_gravity> Velveeta: because that element is an info box that i close when the user does something else.
[09:50:24] <Velveeta> no_gravity: so wrap everything in the body in another div and attach your click event to that
[09:50:42] <BillCriswell> _rgn: Sweet.
[09:50:44] <Velveeta> as in: <body><div id="clickListener"><all other content></div></body>
[09:51:02] <Velveeta> you're just moving the concept of the body tag in one level
[09:51:07] <no_gravity> ValicekB: argh, thats ugly
[09:51:08] <DaniG2k> aaaah i see
[09:51:09] <Velveeta> because mobile safari is stupid about that
[09:51:10] <DaniG2k> nice!!!
[09:51:14] <Velveeta> oh it's hideous, i agree
[09:51:16] <BillCriswell> I are some chinese food. I regret that so much.
[09:51:36] <duch_kazatel> can't you do something like .on('click touchstart', function(){});?
[09:51:42] <duch_kazatel> i remember safari being funky.
[09:51:42] <Velveeta> no_gravity: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2014/02/mouse_event_bub.html
[09:51:57] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: not sure if that works or not, but that'd be nice
[09:53:19] <Velveeta> no_gravity: it looks like duch_kazatel is right about touchstart bubbling up properly, but if you add a listener for both, and the user clicks on e.g. a link or form field, your callback is gonna be triggered twice, once for each of click and touchstart
[09:54:50] <duch_kazatel> truth.
[09:55:06] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to do some weird filtering.
[09:56:05] <anli_> Is foo.on("mousemove", function(e) correct?
[09:56:26] <duch_kazatel> depends - what are you trying to do? :)
[09:56:34] <mojo-jojo> Hi everyone, I'm trying to retrieve the value of objects in an array, what I'm I doing wrong? - http://jsfiddle.net/eMLBF/2/
[09:57:19] <Velveeta> mojo-jojo: myObjects is itself an array of 1 object
[09:57:20] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo did you look at your console?
[09:57:27] <Velveeta> you need to be referencing myObjects[0].data
[09:57:28] <mojo-jojo> yea I didn
[09:57:34] <mojo-jojo> I did - typo
[09:57:41] <synth_> good morning everyone
[09:57:49] <mojo-jojo> I'm actually new to this stuff
[09:57:53] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta gave it to you - myObjects.data isn't right. myObjects[0].data is.
[09:58:04] <mojo-jojo> ok
[09:58:13] <Velveeta> sorry, i forgot to slap his knuckles with a yardstick before handing over the answer :(
[09:58:31] <puchacz> hi, is there a function that would serialize form to something like { name: "John", time: "2pm" }, not to query string?
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo or remove the extra square brackets around myObjects.
[09:58:43] <anli_> Seems like foo.mousemove(function(){ will trigger, but not foo.on("mousemove", function() {
[09:58:51] <mojo-jojo> ok
[09:58:58] <duch_kazatel> anli_ the first is a shortcut to the second.
[09:59:19] <anli_> Oh, wait I think there is an error elsewhere
[09:59:23] <mojo-jojo> @Velveeta, thanks. That worked!
[09:59:41] <duch_kazatel> mojo-jojo try this, too: jsfiddle.net/eMLBF/3/
[09:59:48] <mojo-jojo> ok
[10:00:23] <mojo-jojo> @duch_kazatel, thank you.
[10:00:32] <Velveeta> hey everybody, i have a special gift for you!
[10:00:54] <Velveeta> this was just dropped into my work skype channel, because apparently work is never required ever again...
[10:00:56] <Velveeta> http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b01902112/65536/
[10:01:15] <duch_kazatel> NO.  evil bastard D:
[10:01:55] <mojo-jojo> @Velveeta and @duch_kazatel, been at it for hours. Thanks guys!
[10:02:04] <Velveeta> no problemo
[10:02:13] <duch_kazatel> lol this isn't twitter btw - no need to prepend with @ :)
[10:02:14] <BillCriswell> I introduced my friend to 2048. He send me a text last night 1am literally pissed off at me.
[10:02:22] <duch_kazatel> ahahahahaha
[10:03:18] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:03:25] <Velveeta> i had a similar thing happen to me on facebook :D
[10:03:46] <mojo-jojo> @duch_kazatel, what can I say? I'm a newbie here. :) What's the right way to mention someone here?
[10:03:57] <Velveeta> just use their name in general
[10:04:01] <Velveeta> our irc clients will alert us
[10:04:05] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[10:04:16] <mojo-jojo> Velveeta, duch_kazatel
[10:04:21] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:04:22] <mojo-jojo> Worked!
[10:04:24] <mojo-jojo> :)
[10:05:32] <no_gravity> When an event gives me its target - how do i check if its the document.body?
[10:06:09] <no_gravity> in code: $(document).on("click", function (e) { ..how do i know if the document.body was clicked?..})
[10:07:13] <duch_kazatel> you mean the body?
[10:07:45] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: you mean me?
[10:07:54] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:08:38] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: i dont understand. what is your question?
[10:09:02] <duch_kazatel> "document.body" should be the <body>
[10:09:06] <duch_kazatel> is that what you mean?
[10:09:07] <SprkDev> why is this not changing the text? http://jsfiddle.net/xwE56/
[10:09:39] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity e.target.nodeName is what you want, i think.
[10:09:40] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: yes
[10:10:11] <duch_kazatel> what text?
[10:10:20] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev what text  do you mean?
[10:10:34] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: yes, thanks.
[10:10:46] <SprkDev> basically it should change a text I have in html. It doesn't do it. Do you see anything wrong there with that code/
[10:10:48] <SprkDev> ?
[10:11:06] <duch_kazatel> other than it being incomplete, dunno.
[10:12:44] <no_gravity> Is it possible if a click was happening outside a certain element?
[10:12:55] <no_gravity> Is it possible TO FIND OUT if a click was happening outside a certain element?
[10:13:55] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity how about you explain your use case, because what you're asking sounds like you're approaching a problem in a very strange way.
[10:14:31] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: i have a div on screen that i want to delete if the user clicks somewhere outside of the div.
[10:14:52] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: the tooltip that shows the infos here http://things.gnod.com
[10:15:05] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: when you click on one of the cute thingies.
[10:17:00] <duch_kazatel> this is one way: http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/
[10:18:25] <SprkDev> jquery ajax not working in bootstrap modal.
[10:18:35] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[10:19:11] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: interesting
[10:19:39] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity that uses event delegation.
[10:20:04] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: it doesnt work on ipad
[10:20:32] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity that's because the event delegation model is broken in ipad iirc.
[10:23:02] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: so i need another solution
[10:23:39] <duch_kazatel> search google?
[10:23:54] <duch_kazatel> sorry, don't mean to be flippant, but that's a fairly common problem.
[10:24:05] <duch_kazatel> i think one fix is to wrap the entire document in a div and bind to that instead.
[10:24:35] <duch_kazatel> the other option is to drop the second arg to .on() (the :not() part) and check the event.target.
[10:25:47] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: im googling quite a while now
[10:26:30] <duch_kazatel> what are you lost with then?  my second solution should work fine.
[10:27:01] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: i hate having to add another fullscreen div. so im trying it purely eventbased for now.
[10:27:12] <duch_kazatel> my second solution avoided that.
[10:27:38] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: yes, im playing around with that.
[10:31:30] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: but the div contains lots of stuff. so how do i know if the event.target is one of these or something outside?
[10:32:32] <duch_kazatel> what was your use case again?
[10:32:41] <duch_kazatel> that's right - the flash drives.
[10:33:44] <no_gravity> yes
[10:34:44] <no_gravity> i dont want a click in the tooltip to destroy it. but every other click shall destroy it.
[10:34:46] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to look at the event target and go from there.  this is why I like to use other folks' tooltip libraries.
[10:35:10] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: you mean iterate upwards and see if im inside the tooltip. argh.
[10:35:22] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: i havent seen a tooltip library i like so far.
[10:35:52] <duch_kazatel> powertip is a personal favorite.
[10:35:55] <duch_kazatel> also: there is .has()
[10:36:03] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/has/
[10:38:25] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: hm... i dont see how has() helps here
[10:39:39] <duch_kazatel> if ( !$(parent).has(child) ) {}
[10:40:18] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: yeah. strangely, this always fires: if ($(tooltip).has($(e.target))) alert ("clicked the tooltip");
[10:40:36] <duch_kazatel> i'll update the fiddle in a sec.
[10:43:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/2/
[10:47:14] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: that does nothing when i click anywhere except on "some content"
[10:47:50] <decx> hm has(e.target). clever
[10:49:18] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity exactly.
[10:49:31] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: my usecase is completely different
[10:49:36] <duch_kazatel> here, let me demonstrate then.
[10:50:49] <rcw2> can someone tell me why this jquery-based menu at the bottom of http://vomark.com/product/philips-hp-sonos-5500/ is not working in all browsers?
[10:53:08] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/5/
[10:53:13] <duch_kazatel> a little exploration is a good thing./
[10:53:23] <duch_kazatel> feel free to change #wrapper to whatever you want.
[10:54:17] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: i dont have a wrapper. i want to register clicks anywhere.
[10:54:30] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity dude, read.  change #wrapper to whatever you want.
[10:54:43] <duch_kazatel> it's an example - a use case.
[10:55:33] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: you invented a very complicated onclick :)
[10:55:45] <duch_kazatel> you have a very complicated use care.
[10:55:46] <duch_kazatel> *case.
[10:55:51] <duch_kazatel> the base binding is simple.
[10:57:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/8/
[10:57:17] <duch_kazatel> you could also probably use .find
[10:57:42] <duch_kazatel> and actually http://jsfiddle.net/ydcVe/9/ is all you need.
[10:57:54] <duch_kazatel> no need for the check of the value of the length.
[10:59:38] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: well, thanks for all your help.
[10:59:55] <duch_kazatel> do you see what I'm doing there?
[10:59:59] <duch_kazatel> that should solve your problem.
[11:00:34] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: yeah, i will try it tomorrow. im fine with my current solution.
[11:00:50] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: when you update the drives page, you see everything seems to work now.
[11:00:58] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: a click anywhere closes the tooltip.
[11:11:25] <YokoBR> hey guys, i'm creating a modal window, but it seems that the css is not applying into it
[11:11:31] <YokoBR> sorry for my bad english
[11:11:43] <duch_kazatel> sounds like your CSS isn't targeting it correctly, or your CSS isn't included on the page.
[11:12:48] <YokoBR> duch_kazatel, i did <head> <link href='/novosite/SINDIFES/libs/redmond/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.min.css' rel='stylesheet' /> </head>
[11:13:06] <YokoBR> it work for my other app
[11:13:15] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR any errors in the net panel?
[11:13:27] <YokoBR> duch_kazatel, nope
[11:13:38] <duch_kazatel> then your modal might not have the correct classes/ID
[11:14:41] <YokoBR> duch_kazatel, this is my script http://pastebin.com/pkPgDKMj
[11:14:59] <YokoBR> and the modal is like class="ui-dialog-container"
[11:15:24] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR that... doesn't tell me anything.  if the css isn't applying, it means the CSS is not getting correctly applied to the page.
[11:16:57] <hlvwrk> is there a way to check if an input contains a UTF-8 character?
[11:17:13] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk wat
[11:17:24] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk what problem are you trying to solve?
[11:17:35] <hlvwrk> contains any utf-8 characters. like Ð's etc.
[11:17:37] <hlvwrk> eh
[11:17:57] <duch_kazatel> UTF-8 is an encoding.
[11:18:08] <duch_kazatel> any character can be UTF-8.  you mean special characters?
[11:18:13] <duch_kazatel> like, A-Z?
[11:18:19] <lexbuck> I've got a front-end form for submitting blog posts. I want to have a "save" button as well as a "submit" button. Is it possible to tell which button was pressed and set the status of the post depending on which button was pressed? E.g., if "save" is pressed, submit and set as "draft."
[11:18:30] <hlvwrk> it's kinda an odd bug with an app I'm working on.
[11:18:45] <hlvwrk> basically, form submitting isn't working when a user types an 'UTF-8 character'
[11:18:53] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck yes - you can bind a listener to each button independently.
[11:19:04] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk any letter can be a "UTF-8 Character"
[11:19:37] <hlvwrk> it's odd. it doesn't seem to play well with accented characters.
[11:19:37] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk UTF-8 is an encoding that encompasses the alphabet, as well as many "special" characters, to "UTF-8 character" is a very strange statement.
[11:20:42] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Thanks! I'm still pretty new to django. Could you possibly link me to some docs about this? I'm not exactly sure what you mean.
[11:21:02] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck that's not a django thing, that's a javascript/jquery thing.
[11:21:24] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck check out the jquery docs for .on()
[11:21:40] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Oh, I got ya. Time to google. I'll check out .on(). Thanks again
[11:21:52] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:28:31] <Velveeta> this is proving much too time consuming, i'm gonna have to come back to it later: http://i.imgur.com/spvbveZ.png

[11:29:00] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: You won?
[11:29:12] <BillCriswell> I forget what that one goes up to.
[11:29:13] <Velveeta> not yet, i'm only 1/8 of the way there
[11:29:18] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[11:29:20] <Velveeta> it goes to 65536
[11:29:21] <duch_kazatel> it's at the top, BillCriswell
[11:29:29] <BillCriswell> I still haven't gotten to 2048
[11:29:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Duh.
[11:30:59] <BillCriswell> that number is so big I thought it was a score.
[11:32:17] <mojo-jojo> Velveeta Didn't even get that far before I gave up, that was after lots of attempts.
[11:32:38] <Crippy> Just wondering if anyone would know why an error of Undefined would be passed when set globally and then passed inside a seperate js file...
[11:32:59] <duch_kazatel> Crippy too vague.
[11:33:19] <duch_kazatel> Crippy can you be more specific?
[11:33:24] <Velveeta> because undefined can be overwritten if somebody's being stupid, so sometimes people will explicitly define undefined as a parameter to futureproof themselves against that stupidity
[11:33:29] <Velveeta> if i'm reading that right
[11:33:47] <Velveeta> maybe i'm not reading that right at all
[11:33:57] <duch_kazatel> or maybe he thinks he's setting something globally, but actually isn't?
[11:34:01] <hlvwrk> duch_kazatel: sorry, should've clarrified. it can't allow multibyte characters
[11:34:22] <hlvwrk> single byte (alphanumeric english) is fine
[11:34:35] <Crippy> Ok set a global var inside an HTML template for and specfic Identification, I pass it to a js file which takes that ID so it can identify it specifically to delete a part of the template when clicked upon
[11:35:00] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk something like /[\uD800-\uDFFF]/.test(str) might be what you need.
[11:35:10] <Crippy> tried JS Lint etc without success
[11:35:15] <duch_kazatel> Crippy and you're waiting for document ready, right?
[11:35:26] <duch_kazatel> $(function(){ /* your code here */ });
[11:35:28] <Crippy> yea document ready has been declared
[11:35:31] <Crippy> up
[11:35:52] <Crippy> yup*
[11:36:10] <Crippy> console logged it down the external scripts and the id is fine
[11:36:15] <duch_kazatel> lol "declared" - okay, what's the specific error you're getting?
[11:36:27] <Crippy> as soon as it hits the internal file it goes undefined
[11:36:37] <duch_kazatel> that means the calling function is probably wrong.
[11:37:11] <Crippy> doing on load as $(document).ready(function() { #code#   });
[11:37:31] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - what's the specific error you're gettiong?
[11:37:33] <duch_kazatel> *getting
[11:37:57] <Crippy> console just reports undefined
[11:38:09] <duch_kazatel> please copy/paste the entire error.
[11:38:09] <BillCriswell> At what screen size do you guys say fuck it and just give a browser only the HTML?
[11:39:01] <Crippy> undefined app-script.js:3
[11:39:03] <Velveeta> 1x1
[11:39:18] <Velveeta> crippy: and what does line 3 of that file say?
[11:39:26] <BillCriswell> I love mobile first but... I have no idea where mobile begins.
[11:39:38] <Crippy> im doing console.log(project_id);
[11:39:50] <Velveeta> and how is project_id being passed into that file?
[11:39:52] <Crippy> which is set globally above all script files within the main html file
[11:40:08] <Velveeta> ok, when you say it's being set globally, how are you actually defining it?
[11:40:08] <Crippy> var project_id = 1;
[11:40:17] <Velveeta> is that inside of a function somewhere?
[11:40:25] <Crippy> inside script tags just
[11:40:31] <Crippy> no document.ready
[11:40:36] <Velveeta> that's a function
[11:40:39] <duch_kazatel> a code example at this point i gues.
[11:40:40] <duch_kazatel> *guess
[11:40:43] <Velveeta> the var keyword is making that a local variable
[11:40:56] <Crippy> k
[11:41:08] <Velveeta> declare that variable outside of document.ready if you want it to be global
[11:41:26] <Velveeta> but i should add that global variables are discouraged, there are generally better ways of getting your data into your target functions and files
[11:41:37] <duch_kazatel> or! do var window.project_id = 1;
[11:41:44] <duch_kazatel> or drop the var keyword!
[11:41:51] <duch_kazatel> or do the smart thing and don't use globals.
[11:42:07] <Velveeta> var window.project_id will probably throw an error, but window.project_id would work
[11:42:07] <Crippy> ok man ill try that now!
[11:42:20] <duch_kazatel> Crippy don't do any of those.
[11:42:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm being funny.
[11:42:30] <Crippy> lol
[11:42:37] <Crippy> ill do a small pastebin
[11:42:43] <Crippy> just to give you a quick idea
[11:43:01] <duch_kazatel> call your function explicitly and take the ID as a parameter
[11:45:42] <afib> ive got a quick question: if i have a function declared by something i cannot edit (wordpress plugin) which is using jquery, and i need to override it, is it safe to simply redeclare that function in the same scope, in a js file loaded after the first?
[11:45:53] <duch_kazatel> what is the function?
[11:46:31] <afib> it's a function for Contact Form 7 which outputs validation errors. I want them in an alert() instead of being appended to the form since it breaks my styling
[11:46:41] <afib> eg textbox not filled out etc
[11:46:46] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't do that.
[11:47:06] <duch_kazatel> I'm not a big fan of overriding functions like thjat.
[11:47:08] <duch_kazatel> *that
[11:48:17] <afib> yeah i would normally use a wordpress hook but i can't access the JS that way. at most i could remove the script from being loaded into Wordpress and then load my own, but then that breaks updates even worse. and the built in hooks in Contact Form 7 aren't sufficient. jsut wondering what the best approach would be
[11:48:35] <ph88_> Velveeta: Crippy sets project_id outside of document ready and then tries to use that id inside, like so:     var project_id = 1;       $(document).ready(function() { #code  wanting to used project_id  ... but undefined #   });
[11:48:36] <duch_kazatel> replacing it wholesale.
[11:49:16] <Velveeta> ph88_ is that in the same file?
[11:50:01] <ph88_> Velveeta:   var project_id = 1;  is in html with script tags,  then document ready is in seperate js file
[11:50:24] <ph88_> Velveeta: project_id is a initialization variable to give an id for the current project page
[11:50:42] <duch_kazatel> is the document valid?
[11:51:32] <Velveeta> and inside those script tags, it's not inside any other closure type of construct?
[11:52:58] <ph88_> Velveeta: no
[11:53:06] <duch_kazatel> is the document valid?
[11:53:10] <duch_kazatel> that's important.
[11:53:19] <Velveeta> also, what happens if you remove the var keyword
[11:54:54] <ph88_> duch_kazatel: some html errors, but i think it's not a problem for modern browsers
[11:55:43] <ph88_> Crippy is fixing some html errors ^^
[11:55:46] <duch_kazatel> ph88_ if, for instance, the body is closed wrong or something else is funky.
[11:55:54] <duch_kazatel> those can cause issues.
[11:56:26] <ph88_> oki
[11:56:42] <duch_kazatel> those can break document ready.
[11:56:58] <Velveeta> yeah but document.ready seems to be firing in this case, as it's reporting the undefined error
[11:57:12] <duch_kazatel> it fires, but it might be firing at the wrong time.
[11:57:16] <ph88_> pew pew
[11:57:20] <Velveeta> pew pew indeed
[11:57:37] <duch_kazatel> try using $(window).on('load', function(){ /* code here */ }); instead.
[11:57:58] <Velveeta> i'm still curious what happens if you remove the var keyword
[11:58:54] <ph88_> Crippy remove all of his JS inside the document ready function ... then it worked ... so now he's pasting back all the code section by section
[11:59:07] <duch_kazatel> you guys work together?
[12:01:23] <ph88_> yes by remote
[12:01:29] <ph88_> UK and NL ^^
[12:01:34] <duch_kazatel> ah
[12:01:36] <duch_kazatel> good times.
[12:01:43] <Crippy> silly me
[12:01:46] <ph88_> he found the problem, it was    var project_id;   resetting it :|
[12:01:47] <Crippy> duplicate var
[12:01:55] <Crippy> :(
[12:02:08] <Crippy> thanks ph88 duch_kazatel
[12:02:18] <Crippy> and Velveeta
[12:02:30] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[12:02:33] <duch_kazatel> there we go!
[12:02:42] <ph88_> that's funny that the project_id reset is actually after the code which needed it ...  but i guess that's because the whole document ready function is ready first and then only executed afterwards ^^
[12:03:03] <Velveeta> it's called variable hoisting
[12:03:13] <Velveeta> go google that and it'll explain what happened there
[12:03:19] <ph88_> cool thx
[12:03:21] <ph88_> ill read into that
[12:05:38] <ph88_> hoisting is a funny word ^^
[12:06:08] <Velveeta> you know what else is? sesquicentennial
[12:06:14] <duch_kazatel> and "dognle"
[12:06:18] <duch_kazatel> *dongle
[12:06:54] <ph88_> the fuck o_O
[12:07:39] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:08:09] <ph88_> that word xD
[12:08:32] <duch_kazatel> hah, it's used for little USB keys that auth software.
[12:08:35] <duch_kazatel> among other things.
[12:08:58] <ph88_> LOL
[12:09:01] <ph88_> ye i know dongle :P
[12:09:05] <ph88_> was talking about sesquicentennial
[12:09:11] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah that one.
[12:09:37] <Velveeta> oh, that's a 150th anniversary :D
[12:12:53] <shoky> congradulations
[12:25:58] <kaldrenon|work> Are there any good tools for tracing the full propagation of handlers when an event fires? I'm having a hard time debugging an issue that's rooted in an event handler *not* firing, and I don't know how to find the event that seems to be stopping propagation
[12:26:11] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: was it you who brought up has() in response to my "click outside a div" issue?
[12:29:14] <duch_kazatel> no_gravity
[12:29:15] <duch_kazatel> yep
[12:31:43] <no_gravity> duch_kazatel: thanks! i used it now. it works nicely even on my ipad: http://things.gnod.com
[12:32:07] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[12:33:00] <lianzinho> guys, why some times I cannot get the jquery object in the inspector?
[12:33:11] <lianzinho> when I try $('selector')
[12:33:22] <lianzinho> I get the dom element instead of the query object
[12:33:25] <lianzinho> jquery*
[12:33:33] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho huh?
[12:33:33] <lianzinho> so I cannot chain and test any method...
[12:33:40] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho have an example?
[12:33:54] <lianzinho> I have a list
[12:34:02] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle an example, please.
[12:34:09] <lianzinho> when I type $('.list')
[12:34:57] <lianzinho> I get [<ul class=​"list">​…​</ul>​]
[12:35:04] <lianzinho> instead of a jQuery object
[12:35:15] <lianzinho> so I cannot use query methods in the inspector
[12:35:17] <Fishy_> how can i select the last child of the parent element?
[12:35:33] <gblair> @lianzinho try jQuery('.list')
[12:35:38] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery last-child
[12:35:42] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: :last-child Selector | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/
[12:36:02] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho if you're using chrome, you might be using queryselectorall
[12:36:13] <lianzinho> gblair: same thing
[12:36:39] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: it's chrome
[12:36:52] <Fishy_> duch_kazatel: i know what last child is i do not know how to select the last child of the parent of the current element
[12:36:54] <lianzinho> is that an option? how can I disable? it was normal minutes ago
[12:37:13] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho supply an example, because it sounds like it's working normally.
[12:38:05] <duch_kazatel> Fishy_ look at .parent() and .last()
[12:38:13] <lianzinho> I guess it will work normally in a fiddle
[12:38:15] <lianzinho> I'll try
[12:38:25] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho http://jsfiddle.net/RrAv7/
[12:38:27] <duch_kazatel> look at your console.
[12:38:34] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're confused about something.
[12:39:01] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: no… if I do console.log it works
[12:39:08] <lianzinho> I want to use query directly in the console
[12:39:13] <lianzinho> it's not possible in a fiddle
[12:39:23] <lianzinho> but I have always used in my local development
[12:39:39] <lianzinho> sometimes I want to test a method in realtime or stuff like that
[12:39:40] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're doing something wrong to me.
[12:39:45] <lianzinho> what?
[12:39:48] <duch_kazatel> i know what the console is.
[12:40:50] <lianzinho> I mean… I usually can test methods, select stuff with query and chain with query methods… but now, it's giving me the raw DOM element, which is not chainable at all
[12:41:27] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho the chrome console aliases $ for querySelectorAll iirc.
[12:42:10] <duch_kazatel> did chrome update recently or something?
[12:42:19] <lianzinho> what about jQuery('.list') giving the exact same results?
[12:42:44] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see it in action, because that shouldn't "randomly break"
[12:47:13] <Fishy_> duch_kazatel: could of linked me to siblings.... that worked
[12:47:19] <duch_kazatel> Fishy_ there's also that.
[12:47:34] <duch_kazatel> Fishy_ there are tons of options - it's hard to know what you want wihtout code samples.
[12:49:07] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: how can I show you? in the fiddle we cannot access query directly
[12:49:26] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho huh?
[12:50:15] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: you cannot use jQuery from the console in jsFiddle
[12:50:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm using it right now.
[12:50:44] <duch_kazatel> so...
[12:50:50] <lianzinho> how?
[12:51:13] <duch_kazatel> well, I opened up the console and...
[12:51:17] <duch_kazatel> entered in some code.
[12:51:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm more curious how you're using things.
[12:51:41] <duch_kazatel> some things return non jquery objects.
[12:51:43] <lianzinho> like I said, the most simple way ever
[12:51:49] <repxl> how i can get a json with jquery ? and use the dataň
[12:51:52] <duch_kazatel> hell, even a screenshot of the error would be helpful.
[12:51:58] <duch_kazatel> repxl need more info.
[12:52:14] <repxl> duch_kazatel you are familiar with google maps geocoding api ?
[12:52:28] <duch_kazatel> repxl not really, but that doesn't matter much.
[12:52:37] <duch_kazatel> repxl are you trying to use their JSON api?
[12:52:46] <duch_kazatel> because that means you want $.ajax()
[12:54:19] <repxl> duch_kazatel and how i can handle the json output ? to pass it to php i wanna save the results to a database
[12:54:40] <duch_kazatel> repxl wat?  why not call it from php?
[12:55:13] <repxl> duch_kazatel that's the reason because geocoding is limited for server side and free for client side look - >https://developers.google.com/maps/articles/geocodestrat?hl=fr#client
[12:55:15] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: take a look… https://www.dropbox.com/s/o25tqnghr4lblml/jquery_error_example.png
[12:55:19] <duch_kazatel> y
[12:55:20] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:25:12:54:29] * vsmith (~vsmith@107-129-178-42.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net)
[12:55:22] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[12:55:36] <duch_kazatel> repxl then you'll have to post it to your server via a form.
[12:55:36] <vsmith> any one know where i can find a good Jquery Mobile developer?
[12:56:06] <vsmith> who may have experience with WordPress and jSon API's
[12:56:18] <repxl> duch_kazatel no use ajax ?
[12:56:28] <duch_kazatel> repxl you'd use ajax for that.
[12:56:28] <duch_kazatel> ...
[12:57:02] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho what all is included on the page?
[12:57:21] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: all what?
[12:57:35] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho wait try .css('height')
[12:57:54] <repxl> duch_kazatel but i don' know how to get the json output from the ajax and convert it to a array so i can handle it on the php side again
[12:58:16] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho both of those methods require at least one argument.  that's the error.
[12:58:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl why not just ship over the object?  an array doesn't really make sense.
[12:58:56] <repxl> duch_kazatel so they run the api on the client side but i can continue use the output of the json on my server side
[12:59:05] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: ok, but what about the selector alone just giving me the DOM instead of the object?
[12:59:37] <lianzinho> are there any method which would give me the query object?
[12:59:57] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho that IS the jquery object.
[13:00:05] <duch_kazatel> that's what it looks like in the console.
[13:00:21] <duch_kazatel> seriously - try running $('.list').css('height');
[13:00:40] <repxl> duch_kazatel i really don't know the relation ship between javascript and json i just know the first j stands for "java i think" and o for "object" but i never used json with javascript can you give me a example ?
[13:00:51] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: it worked, but I cannot inspect it.. the prototype and stuff, look at the the fiddle you showed me, I want that output
[13:01:12] <duch_kazatel> repxl javascript object notation
[13:01:45] <duch_kazatel> repxl you want to serialize it.
[13:01:59] <duch_kazatel> "i cannot inspect it.. the prototype and stuff" huh?
[13:02:24] <duch_kazatel> ah, you want the full jquery object w/ methods and whatnot.
[13:02:39] <io____> hi can I use .load to load html from a remote URL ?
[13:03:49] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho no idea how chrome does it, but I know firebug makes that simple.
[13:03:54] <duch_kazatel> all right i need to go to lunch folks.
[13:03:55] <duch_kazatel> bbiab.
[13:07:37] <NoiseEee> io____: typically no
[13:07:51] <NoiseEee> io____: not if that 'remote url' isnt on the same domain as the page
[13:07:55] <io____> what s my next oprion then?
[13:08:57] <repxl> duch_kazatel the ajax is just for transfer the output to php so i can use it inside php right ? otherwise to get the json from url i need to use this $.getJSON('http://redrock.com:6606/api/values', function(data){
[13:09:37] <c0mrade_> WriteLn.Console("Hello");
[13:10:01] <c0mrade_> I have a block of php code <?php exec('"C:\Program Files\PHP\v5.4\php" "bot.php""'); ?>
[13:10:16] <c0mrade_> I want to create a button and execute that php code only if I click that button.
[13:10:31] <c0mrade_> So it's like "If I click button then execute code".
[13:18:16] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: you would use ajax/xhr.  when clicked, do some ajax to that script
[13:19:37] <c0mrade_> Yes, that's great.
[13:19:38] <c0mrade_> How?
[13:19:39] <c0mrade_> :P
[13:20:12] <NoiseEee> start https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:20:52] <c0mrade_> <button type="submit">Submit</button>
[13:22:04] <NoiseEee> that will submit a regular form, you will have to learn some javascrip
[13:23:10] <c0mrade_> Link you offered didn't help me.
[13:23:25] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: you're looking for a script that will do what you want?
[13:23:29] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: its not going to happen.
[13:24:22] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ look at some examples maybe.  come up with some code, pastebin it, and maybe you;ll get some help.
[13:24:29] <NoiseEee> but nobody's writing this for you
[13:25:16] <c0mrade_> I have a php file with some code in it. I wan to click a button to run that code in that php file.
[13:25:26] <c0mrade_> It's not like 1000 lines of code.
[13:25:30] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: i understand. thats called making an ajax/xhr request
[13:25:44] <NoiseEee> google about it, see what you come up with, someone migjt offer help
[13:26:15] <NoiseEee> i'm continually amazed by the amount of people who don't bother to learn/do anything themselves, and just want the answers. "dude its like 10 minutes!"  "come on, i'm on a deadline"   bfd
[13:27:08] <c0mrade_> 10 minutes?
[13:27:09] <c0mrade_> Hehe.
[13:27:27] <c0mrade_> I am just not comfortable with the syntax and stuff.
[13:27:41] <c0mrade_> My example would take like 10 seconds from an experienced programmer.
[13:27:50] <c0mrade_> simple button that executes a page.
[13:27:56] <c0mrade_> php page.
[13:27:59] <c0mrade_> file*
[13:28:40] <lianzinho> guys, any clue on why if I type something directly from the console it works but the SAME thing from the source does not?
[13:29:01] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: maybe whatever is 'in the source' is depending on some things in the DOM that aren't there yet
[13:29:57] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: but it does not raise any error at all… I mean, when not dealing with AJAX stuff should load in the order it is written, isn't it?
[13:30:21] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: where is the script? before </body>?  pastebin an example
[13:30:53] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: yes, it's in the header...
[13:31:14] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: if it's in the <head> then the DOM isnt there yet.  move all <script> stuff before the closing body tag.
[13:32:28] <duch_away> lianzinho wrap your scripts in doc ready.
[13:32:52] <lianzinho> duch_away: it's already wrapped
[13:33:06] <duch_kazatel> and the document is valid?
[13:33:11] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: well without code, we can keep guessing a zillion things
[13:36:02] <duch_kazatel> yeah that too.
[13:37:04] <duch_kazatel> god i'm rewriting a bunch of validation.  this is bullshit.
[13:37:51] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/J334g6zV
[13:37:54] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/J334g6zV
[13:38:21] <NoiseEee> are you calling that before your call to list.js?
[13:38:23] <duch_kazatel> i can see that.
[13:38:39] <NoiseEee> and what is $search?
[13:40:09] <Ownix> Does anyone know if .wrap has changed between jquery 1 and jquery 2?
[13:40:25] <Ownix> A lot of my stuff using it broke when I updated to 2.1
[13:40:40] <duch_kazatel> Ownix the only difference between the 1.x series and 2.x series is 2.x drops support for old browsers.
[13:41:36] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  thats odd. When I uncomment 2 and comment out 1 my page behaves completely differently. My browser is the latest version of chrome
[13:42:00] <duch_kazatel> specific version numbers please.
[13:42:02] <duch_kazatel> 2.1?  1.1?
[13:42:18] <repxl> $.each is a loop used on objects ?
[13:42:26] <duch_kazatel> repxl you can use it for that, yes.
[13:42:26] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:
[13:42:27] <StanAccy> Is $(window) the correct way to reference the window (browser viewport) ?
[13:42:27] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: yes… before, in fact, list.js is in the footer
[13:42:29] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/U6HbapRb
[13:42:38] <Ownix> 2.1.0 and 1.11
[13:42:44] <duch_kazatel> Ownix 2.1.0 is very old.
[13:42:54] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: I must say that it works in the first time, before I do that .clone() operation
[13:42:58] <duch_kazatel> err, wait nvm.
[13:43:03] <duch_kazatel> the versioning is strange.
[13:43:12] <BillCriswell>  You thinking 1.2?
[13:43:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.com/download/
[13:43:40] <repxl> just to be sure jquery is a javascript framework right ?
[13:43:47] <duch_kazatel> repxl no, it's a library
[13:43:50] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I just checked and it seems to be the latest version avalible via NuGet for Visual Studio
[13:44:02] <duch_kazatel> Ownix yeah, 2.1.0 is the most recent of the 2.x series.
[13:44:32] <duch_kazatel> Ownix i'd need to see your code.
[13:44:37] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise, i'm flying blind.
[13:45:26] <repxl> duch_kazatel is there a difference between framework and library ?
[13:45:48] <BillCriswell> repxl: All of the letters besides a.
[13:45:54] <duch_kazatel> hahahah
[13:45:56] <BillCriswell> and r.
[13:46:36] <duch_kazatel> I think of it this way - the library contains a bunch of utilities that you can take or leave, but you run your code on a framework.
[13:47:46] <BillCriswell> I think of it like... a framework tells you a bunch of ways to do things, a library gives you a bunch of ways to do things.. so a framework can be a library but not the other way around?
[13:47:51] <BillCriswell> Words are stupid.
[13:48:02] <duch_kazatel> eh, i think of it like rails vs. jquery
[13:48:20] <duch_kazatel> rails is a framework - it provides a bunch of stuff for you to build on top of.  jquery is something you can happen to use.
[13:48:23] <BillCriswell> A library is something you access... a framework is something you work inside?
[13:48:34] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[13:48:35] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[13:48:41] <BillCriswell> Fuck yeah words.
[13:49:06] <duch_kazatel> Angular would be a good example of a javascript framework imo.
[13:49:26] <BillCriswell> A plugin works off a library or a framework?
[13:49:37] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: any clue on that?
[13:49:44] <BillCriswell> Maybe framework would be better off having "components"?
[13:49:49] <BillCriswell> I don't know.
[13:49:56] <duch_kazatel> "plugins" add functionality to another thing.  frameworks could be a collection of libraries.
[13:50:22] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: are you updating IDs after the clone?  i'm working at the moment, but http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good place to start with debugging
[13:50:31] <repxl> duch_kazatel rails is a js framework ?
[13:50:42] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Come on. No one in here works.
[13:50:43] <duch_kazatel> rails is a ruby framework.
[13:50:57] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: what do you mean about update IDs ?
[13:50:59] <BillCriswell> It's a framework built on ruby?
[13:51:10] <BillCriswell> Just thinking in terms of wording.
[13:51:11] <duch_kazatel> hahaha.  it's a framework for ruby.
[13:51:32] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  I tried my best to fix spacing for you. The html is generated by code, the javascript is supposed to wrap <thead></thead> tags around the <tr></tr> tags that surrpound the header. It works in 1.11 but breaks in 2.1. When it breaks the problem is that allthe headers run together. Ill try to get some sample output of working vs broken for you if
[13:51:32] <Ownix> you need it http://pastie.org/private/b43rsvxe80aja8jqp0ioda
[13:51:33] <duch_kazatel> you could technically write a ruby framework in C i'd reckon.  that'd be stupid, but y'know.
[13:51:42] <BillCriswell> I should make a picture of a house and label it. The ground is Ruby, the frame of the house is Rails, the rooms are... libraries?
[13:51:54] <duch_kazatel> appliances are libraries.
[13:52:10] <duch_kazatel> Ownix one sec.
[13:52:12] <NoiseEee> lianzinho: if you clone something, all of a sudden you (might have) more than one element using an ID; ids must be unique, esp. if you're using them as references in other functions
[13:52:20] <BillCriswell> I think jQuery would be my bath tub.
[13:53:14] <BillCriswell> Rooms are different directories...
[13:53:21] <duch_kazatel> Ownix oh, I think you're confused about rendering things.
[13:53:23] <BillCriswell> This could be a pretty great image.
[13:53:26] <lianzinho> NoiseEee: in fact when I clone I substitute the same element with the clone, so that's not possible because it overwrite the HTML
[13:53:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woah.
[13:53:43] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: 2.1 renders differently?
[13:54:13] <BillCriswell> The front door is the... router
[13:54:47] <duch_kazatel> ownix kind of?  can you make this example function? http://jsfiddle.net/7jxvu/
[13:55:18] <duch_kazatel> woah wait a sec.
[13:55:24] <duch_kazatel> i can replicate/.
[13:56:19] <duch_kazatel> Ownix aaaah, you're using wrap wrong to begin with, but perhaps 1.11 is being more forgiving.
[13:56:44] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: here is a working example of my problem http://jsfiddle.net/7jxvu/1/
[13:56:52] <Ownix> Wrong wrap?
[13:56:54] <duch_kazatel> Ownix i've got it figured out.
[13:57:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7jxvu/3/
[13:58:08] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to use that callback, you only need to return the wrapping html, not the wrap + contents.
[13:58:42] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: that makes sense
[13:58:52] <StanAccy> Im showing a div using jquery and positiong it (or trying to) with jqueryui .position(), however, my div is being constrained to  the parent block element.  Is there a way to overcome this and let the div be positioned in the center of the viewport?
[13:58:59] <Velveeta> well, looks like this channel is one of the only things i can do right now
[13:59:10] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: thank you for your help
[13:59:11] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy position: fixed;
[13:59:12] <duch_kazatel> css
[13:59:17] <Velveeta> since time warner decided to drop the bottom out of my internet connection
[13:59:31] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: Thanks, Ill give that a shot
[14:00:16] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: Awesome! Thanks.  I had it set to absolute
[14:00:37] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy position: fixed; removes it from the document and positions it according to the viewport.
[14:00:55] <duch_kazatel> well, removes it from normal flow.
[14:05:41] <blindMoe> I am trying to use .hover() to add a class to a subnav but when the user moves their mouse over the subnav the mouseleave event is called and it essentially disappears.  Is there something like .hover() that will work for an element and its child elements even if those children elements are positioned outside of the parent?
[14:06:36] <DukeDrake> hi
[14:07:41] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe you want mouseenter
[14:07:50] <blindMoe> thanks
[14:08:19] <Velveeta> hover should bind itself to mouseenter/mouseleave already i'm pretty sure
[14:08:31] <blindMoe> that is what I thought it was doing
[14:08:49] <blindMoe> the problem is that it seems to just check the coordinates of the parents and not the children elements
[14:08:50] <duch_kazatel> ah that's right hover binds two events.
[14:08:53] <Velveeta> you might need to set up something a little more fancy, like a debounced kind of mouseenter/mouseleave binding
[14:09:13] <blindMoe> seems like it would be an issue that others have ran into quite a bit
[14:09:27] <duch_kazatel> most people don't position things outside of their parent.
[14:09:29] <Velveeta> if you can show us a demo, we can probably tell you what'll work
[14:09:46] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: +1
[14:10:27] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: drop down menus are almost always positioned outside of their parent are they not?
[14:11:00] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe i think you're confused about how they work - sounds like you might be binding incorrectly.
[14:11:08] <Velveeta> not so much outside as alongside, and css supports a proper :hover class, which javascript only imitates
[14:11:08] <duch_kazatel> sample code would be helpful.
[14:11:22] <blindMoe> I'll create a quick samples
[14:11:38] <DukeDrake> hm ... I just wanted to start a new jquery adventure... added the src ... but the $(document).ready() doesn't work: "$ is not defined"
[14:11:44] <Velveeta> i'm curious how far outside the parent we're talking here
[14:12:02] <duch_kazatel> DukeDrake what's the src you're using?
[14:12:03] <Velveeta> dukedrake: are you including jquery before your document.ready block?
[14:12:34] <DukeDrake> <script type="text/javascipt" src="js/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
[14:12:36] <blindMoe> Velveeta: the top of the child element buts up to the bottom of the parent element
[14:12:44] <DukeDrake> oh ... found the error , lol
[14:12:48] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:13:00] <Velveeta> blindmoe: ok, that sounds like it should be pretty acceptable
[14:13:04] <DukeDrake> thanx anyway ;)
[14:13:04] <Tomashe> anyone got ANY idea why the gallery swiper plugin is not even initizlize : http://m.studio4.co.il/#M37
[14:13:20] <DukeDrake> (works now) ^^
[14:14:44] <Velveeta> tomashe: jesus christ, how many images are you front-loading like that?
[14:14:59] <Tomashe> ALOT
[14:15:01] <Tomashe> :/
[14:15:15] <Velveeta> is this meant for smartphones i'm assuming? if you have a swiper type of plugin?
[14:15:21] <duch_kazatel> https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRuVVnjpHnbYQH94AgeHL3ADeFJcQOkfMl41gWHI227qvY6y8XkZQ
[14:15:22] <Tomashe> yes
[14:15:30] <Tomashe> maybe i can get lazyload or something
[14:15:32] <Tomashe> im not sure
[14:15:44] <Velveeta> uh, yeah.. because i'm already up over 10 megs and still counting
[14:15:52] <Tomashe> damn
[14:15:55] <Velveeta> ok, 10.1 is where it stopped, you can't be doing that to smartphone users
[14:16:00] <duch_kazatel> that'll load liek ass on mobile.
[14:16:03] <duch_kazatel> *like
[14:16:09] <blindMoe> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/ByXAC/  very basic example
[14:16:13] <Tomashe> so what u suggest
[14:16:13] <Tomashe> ?
[14:16:41] <Velveeta> well, that was 449 separate requests... do you really need to serve up that many images on the landing page?
[14:17:04] <Tomashe> no but the entire is a onepage
[14:17:08] <Tomashe> its not really the FIRST page
[14:17:15] <Tomashe> its all website images
[14:17:32] <Tomashe> i think i will use lazyload or something but
[14:17:33] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe easy - you're binding to dropdown-toggle
[14:17:38] <duch_kazatel> that's not the parent.
[14:17:38] <Velveeta> blindmoe: oh, no wonder, you have this going off the wrong element
[14:17:39] <Velveeta> right
[14:17:41] <duch_kazatel> dropdown
[14:17:47] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[14:18:12] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe http://jsfiddle.net/ByXAC/1/
[14:18:25] <blindMoe> oh jesus
[14:18:29] <blindMoe> I can't believe I didn't see that
[14:18:33] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:18:35] <duch_kazatel> it happens.
[14:18:38] <blindMoe> feel free to throw tomatoes at me
[14:18:41] <Tomashe> the amount of the images is what doesn make te swiper to work?
[14:18:44] <duch_kazatel> nah it's fine.
[14:18:55] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe you need to fix the images before you do much else.
[14:18:55] <io____> what s the best method to avoid same policy for html load from an external server?
[14:19:03] <duch_kazatel> io____ huh?
[14:19:22] <duch_kazatel> io____ you mean to not have problems with CORS?
[14:19:26] <io____> duch_kazatel: i want to load html/json from an external server
[14:19:27] <Tomashe> duch , vel : any ideas whats the best method to solve the images thing ?
[14:19:38] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe lazy load
[14:19:50] <io____> duch_kazatel: no php, no iframes
[14:19:54] <duch_kazatel> io____ JSONP will do that.  otherwise, you need to proxy through a server you own
[14:20:05] <duch_kazatel> but JSONP only works if the service offers it.
[14:20:09] <Velveeta> tomashe: the amount of images isn't what makes the swiper not work *i don't think*, but that's still pretty horrible to consider loading that many immediately
[14:20:26] <duch_kazatel> io____ do you own the site you're trying to grab data from?
[14:20:35] <io____> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:20:46] <Velveeta> tomashe: as it doesn't seem to be throwing an exception, i can't say why it's not working
[14:21:00] <duch_kazatel> then either setup a way to let people use JSONP or enable the CORS headers.
[14:21:42] <bleathem> Is this a good place to ask about the jQuery UI widget factory?
[14:21:59] <duch_kazatel> bleathem you can try :)
[14:22:49] <bleathem> so I can see that the widget factory "_on" method checks if the widget is disabled (via suppressDisabledCheck)
[14:22:53] <bleathem> my question is
[14:23:02] <bleathem> why doesn't the _trigger method do a similar check?
[14:24:03] <io____> duch_kazatel: y server runs on Drupal and its Service module seems to offer jsonp
[14:24:35] <Velveeta> _trigger's whole job is to simply namespace events before they ship
[14:24:48] <duch_kazatel> io____ i wouldn't know the specifics for your setup.
[14:24:49] <Velveeta> it's the event emitter, that's a separate concern than the event listener
[14:25:19] <bleathem> so it's up to the listener to check if the widget is disabled before acting on the event?
[14:25:31] <Velveeta> right, which is why _on automates that check for you
[14:25:37] <bleathem> it would seem logical to me that if a widget is disabled it shouldn't emit any events...
[14:25:46] <Velveeta> or if you have external code consuming that, then you would have to check manually
[14:26:07] <bleathem> where this comes up is handlers registered via the options
[14:26:14] <Velveeta> a widget may have events that are intended to be emitted during disabled state
[14:26:22] <bleathem> they get triggered even when the widget is disabled
[14:26:31] <bleathem> since they don't use the _on syntax
[14:26:42] <Velveeta> like if you have a widget that's ajax-driven, and disable it during the data fetch, and emit an event when the fetch is successful, and then after injecting content, re-enable it
[14:26:54] <bleathem> that makes sense
[14:27:08] <Velveeta> are you talking about a particular widget?
[14:27:09] <bleathem> it's just cumbersome to have to impl the check in all the handlers passed via the options
[14:27:19] <bleathem> I'm preparing a talk on the widget factory
[14:27:34] <bleathem> and I developed a simple sample for the talk
[14:27:42] <bleathem> so I'm referring to that
[14:27:43] <Velveeta> it's a subject dear to my own heart :D
[14:27:55] <bleathem> but it's generally aplicable I would think
[14:28:21] <Velveeta> mind if i take a look at your sample code?
[14:28:45] <bleathem> hmm, I suppose I should add some logic to prevent triggering events that don't make sense in the disabled state
[14:28:59] <bleathem> Velveeta: sure - give me 30 secs to clean it up first ;)
[14:29:07] <Velveeta> sounds good
[14:30:00] <Velveeta> we overrode the _trigger in our own widget factory instance, but that was only to allow for any _triggered event to execute an option of the same name if it was a function
[14:31:02] <winux> hey guys, im trying to create change functions from within an each loop.. but they aren't being loaded. Could someone take a look here: https://gist.github.com/egtom/9832c3f82fcfc0bfd0d8 .. I think the solution is simple, I just don't know it

[14:33:52] <winux> reposted: http://pastebin.com/UEFqvDaN
[14:34:32] <Velveeta> winux: when you say they aren't being loaded, you're not expecting them to immediately set that state, right?
[14:34:59] <winux> Velveeta: no, i do want them to work after the page is loaded though
[14:35:12] <winux> Velveeta: but the changes aren't firing off the appropriate functions
[14:35:39] <Velveeta> is there a demo someplace that we can see this?

[14:43:14] <winux> duch_kazatel: when the checkbox is clicked (changed)
[14:43:26] <duch_kazatel> use .prop() instead.
[14:43:36] <duch_kazatel> .prop('checked')

[14:54:14] <duch_kazatel> that statement doesn't make sense./

[15:36:35] <dotut> or should i check for drives.length first
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> dunno what your use case it.
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> *is
[15:38:52] <dotut> ok thanks i will just go ahead and add a nested check to see if that fixes it
[15:47:03] <dorf_> http://jsfiddle.net/gMr36/ i'm trying to make the div size based on the height of the window.  what am i doing wrong?
[15:47:29] <duch_kazatel> why in the world aren't you using css for that?
[15:47:59] <dorf_> how?
[15:48:06] <duch_kazatel> height: 100%;
[15:49:53] <dorf_> doesn't work
[15:51:26] <duch_kazatel> or you could use vh
[15:51:42] <duch_kazatel> what sort of browser support do you need?
[15:51:51] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/qJKU6/ < what do i do wrong here when i console.log the src i see the right src but ON LIVE i see the old src.. any idea?
[15:52:33] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe what are you trying to do?
[15:53:05] <Tomashe> im trying to load the the images on jquery page show
[15:53:12] <Tomashe> so if u are not in the currect page it wont show
[15:53:16] <Tomashe> and if u are it will show
[15:53:21] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe ... you're using onhashchange wrong.
[15:53:30] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn hashchange
[15:53:31] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Window.onhashchange - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onhashchange
[15:54:14] <Tomashe> but when i console.log the hash i see the right one
[15:54:17] <duch_kazatel> window.onhashchange = function() { /* Your code here */ }
[15:54:56] <Tomashe> ok let me try
[15:57:21] <ankurk_> Why I have to click twice on down arrow for first time to make click event work? http://jsbin.com/gatoduxe/2/edit
[16:00:07] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ because your code is weird.  removing the .addClass('hidden') fixes it.
[16:00:35] <ankurk_> but I am removing class 'hidden'
[16:00:50] <duch_kazatel> then it looks like you need to refactor.
[16:01:21] <ankurk_> hmm
[16:08:10] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel : i really dont get it , http://m.studio4.co.il/ sometimes it show the images and sometimes it still show the loader
[16:08:14] <Tomashe> what i do wrong
[16:08:33] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/qJKU6/2/ < currect code
[16:09:49] <duch_kazatel> i dunno.  not going to dig through your lazy lopad right now.
[16:09:50] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[16:10:11] <duch_kazatel> wait this isn't the lazy load.
[16:10:21] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[16:10:26] <Tomashe> its not . its custome made by me lol
[16:10:32] <duch_kazatel> what does this have to do with hash changes?
[16:10:52] <Tomashe> because the jquery mobile change the hash on page change
[16:11:18] <Tomashe> so i was thinking about catching the hash which is the id of the page and SHOW the images on that page only
[16:11:41] <Tomashe> that way only the images that user want to see is loading ..
[16:12:00] <duch_kazatel> var images = $("body").find(window.location.hash).find(".iloader"); is really bizarre.
[16:12:09] <Tomashe> why
[16:12:39] <duch_kazatel> just a strange way to do it.
[16:12:42] <Tomashe> window.location.hash , contain a simple string '#M<somenumber> in my case
[16:12:45] <duch_kazatel> also you're saying the issue is t now.
[16:12:45] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:25:16:09:49] * tyfighter (~tyfighter@c-76-126-187-182.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) Quit (Qui
[16:12:47] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:12:54] <duch_kazatel> your issue is this: http://m.studio4.co.il/#M1 doesn't work, right?
[16:13:16] <Tomashe> not .. if u scroll to other pages
[16:13:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:13:37] <Tomashe> it should load it by page CHANGE .. i still need to fix the first page load issue to show the images
[16:13:55] <duch_kazatel> so your issue is the first page?
[16:13:59] <Tomashe> but try to click somewhere and move to other pages with images
[16:14:01] <Tomashe> NO
[16:14:08] <Tomashe> my issue is to show images on page CHANGE
[16:14:16] <Tomashe> first image i still did not handle yet
[16:14:27] <duch_kazatel> the
[16:14:27] <duch_kazatel> #M2
[16:14:30] <duch_kazatel> those images?
[16:15:38] <duch_kazatel> it's working - #m2 doesn't have any content.
[16:16:27] <Tomashe> omg
[16:16:32] <Tomashe> never mind im too tired to explain
[16:16:36] <Tomashe> heheh
[16:16:50] <Tomashe> how did u even arrive to M2
[16:16:50] <duch_kazatel> you're making no sense whatsoever, soooo.
[16:17:10] <Tomashe> ok go to homepage
[16:17:11] <duch_kazatel> i can't even tell what your issue is.  it sounds like you want to make images show up on hash change.
[16:17:13] <Tomashe> m.studio4.co.il
[16:17:20] <Tomashe> click on the first item on the right
[16:17:27] <Tomashe> this page have images
[16:17:32] <Tomashe> M37
[16:17:40] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:17:46] <Tomashe> it sounds like you want to make images show up on hash change. < yes
[16:17:50] <Fr151> hi everyone, I'm using the query UI autocomplete function with ajax. My server is giving me back an array of json objects , but i can't get the auto complete feature to work. Would anyone mind looking at my code and helping me
[16:18:22] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe the div likely doesn't have content in time for your other code to run.  that's what it looks like tbh.
[16:18:34] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:19:02] <Tomashe> how can it be .. all pages are loading when entering m.studio4....
[16:19:07] <Tomashe> its onepage website
[16:19:19] <Tomashe> and when i console.log inside my loop
[16:19:35] <duch_kazatel> dunno, just tossing out ideas broseph.
[16:20:50] <Tomashe> and when i console.log inside my loop for $(this).attr("src") it show the changed src
[16:20:56] <Tomashe> but on live it doesnt
[16:21:10] <Tomashe> so what exactly is that $(this). realated for insie my each loop?
[16:21:26] <duch_kazatel> sounds like jquery mobile is doing something you're not expecting.
[16:21:40] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the current object.
[16:22:39] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:31:57] <zalem-developer> how is everyone?
[16:32:54] <zalem-developer> anyone good with kendo ui (treeview)
[16:33:12] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ zalem-developer
[16:33:13] <b-ot> zalem-developer: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:34:03] <zalem-developer> what a hole
[16:34:10] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:34:36] <zalem-developer> I’m trying to figure how when i create my treeview …how to make the nodes action links to a action in my controller
[16:35:58] <duch_kazatel> so when a click happens, fire a function?
[16:36:59] <zalem-developer> call an action on my controller….the left side of my screen..is a partial view of a treeview and the right is a grid of data…when someone clicks a treenode, it’ll call an action in my controller and the grid will be refreshed with data
[16:37:12] <zalem-developer> my treeview is being built on the server via razor syntax
[16:37:30] <duch_kazatel> not sure if kendo has something hand-rolled for this, but you'd look at jquery's .on() method for that.
[16:38:13] <zalem-developer> well…for dev purposes…i use the onselect method…but i don’t know how to make a call to the controller from there
[16:38:29] <duch_kazatel> is the controller in javascript?
[16:40:53] <zalem-developer> no
[16:40:55] <zalem-developer> this is asp.net mvc
[16:41:35] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you'd need to expose an endpoint for you to call then.
[16:41:43] <duch_kazatel> i'd hit up a room about asp.net for that.
[16:45:07] <zalem-developer> ok..thanks
[16:46:00] <nhulea> hey will this work in ie 6 + http://jsfiddle.net/5pmrN/
[16:50:13] <duch_kazatel> are you asking for something specific, or...?
[16:50:48] <nhulea> no I just noticed that jquery ui is  IE 7+
[16:50:56] <nhulea> so I added an input check
[16:51:13] <nhulea> I was just wondering if .change () works in ie 6
[16:51:23] <duch_kazatel> it might?
[16:51:27] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:51:34] <nhulea> haha ok
[16:54:02] <duch_kazatel> back
[16:54:13] <nhulea> cool
[16:56:28] <io____> hi so i ve got this code http://jsfiddle.net/UW3yP/  which pulls content from this json http://lagenda.org/splash?callback=jsonCallback , how can i get each title of each node?
[16:57:31] <duch_kazatel> do you really need a callback btw?
[16:57:54] <io____> duch_kazatel: it s the only way to get json from an external server right?
[16:57:58] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:58:06] <io____> i mean with jsonp
[16:58:16] <duch_kazatel> you're not using jsonp there.
[16:58:55] <io____> right i am usind access control headers
[16:59:05] <duch_kazatel> so http://jsfiddle.net/UW3yP/3/
[16:59:18] <duch_kazatel> now, you want the title attribute in those nodes?
[17:00:08] <nhulea> .title ?
[17:01:09] <io____> duch_kazatel: for example
[17:01:42] <duch_kazatel> your data is very strange.
[17:01:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/UW3yP/5/
[17:01:53] <duch_kazatel> but that's how you'd do it.
[17:02:05] <duch_kazatel> I'd ditch the wrapping "nodes" object.
[17:02:13] <duch_kazatel> and not use the word "node"
[17:02:19] <duch_kazatel> but that's how you'd do it.
[17:05:06] <io____> ok ditched
[17:10:44] <io____> unditched...
[17:10:58] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:11:13] <duch_kazatel> did you look at the fixed version I gave you?
[17:11:16] <duch_kazatel> it's an object.
[17:11:18] <duch_kazatel> like any other.
[17:11:19] <duch_kazatel> easy stuffd.
[17:11:26] <duch_kazatel> *stuff
[17:13:27] <io____> duch_kazatel: how can i wrap each item with a div or li ?
[17:14:11] <io____> $.each(result.nodes[i].node.title) .... ?
[17:15:16] <duch_kazatel> what do you think you'd do?
[17:16:19] <io____> i should do ... for each item in the array, print opening tag, print item, print clsing tag
[17:16:23] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:16:28] <duch_kazatel> you want to wrap, right?
[17:16:52] <io____> wrap each item in an element
[17:17:43] <duch_kazatel> did you try searching google?
[17:17:47] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:17:53] * RaptorJesus exposes himself to the channel and slaps everyone in the face.
[17:18:43] <duch_kazatel> io____ because there are tons of ways to do that.  here's one.

[18:13:24] <saiyan> oh ok
[18:14:14] <BillCriswell> saiyan: How is your HTML and CSS?
[18:14:33] <tw2113> i'll +1 if you say "very well, thank you"
[18:14:40] <saiyan> ugh well
[18:14:43] <saiyan> let me pastebin it

[18:19:06] <tw2113> is script.js the jquery copy?
[18:19:12] <tw2113> is it in the same folder as your html file?
[18:20:09] <saiyan> yes everythings in the same file
[18:20:13] <saiyan> no
[18:20:21] <saiyan> wait a sec
[18:20:26] <saiyan> i think the jquery files are shortcuts lol
[18:22:29] <saiyan> ugh
[18:22:38] <saiyan> no theyre not shortcuts
[18:22:45] <tw2113> shortcuts?
[18:22:48] <saiyan> nvm
[18:22:53] <saiyan> they had little arrows in the bottom right
[18:25:03] <saiyan> nice!
[18:25:06] <saiyan> i got it working
[18:28:11] <nights> hi
[18:28:26] <nights> what could be the reason why my slideUp/Down dont work as expected?

[18:42:20] <Sherbert> Does jquery die when it encounters a function it can't handle properly?  Sherbert
[18:43:02] <__joshua__> depends
[18:43:19] <__joshua__> the current execution block will stop on a uncaught exception
[18:45:14] <Sherbert> That might explain why nothing works anymore when I put the function in my code..
[18:45:41] <Fishy_> Anyone know a clean was to change a <td> with text to a input area so you can edit a grid as if it were Excel.
[18:46:13] <Sherbert>    $('.flexslider', content).css({"background-color":"#BF5FFF"});  This works, clicking on my other jquery element that opens stuff then shows a nice box with a pink bg.  Using this instead  $('.flexslider', content).flexslider({slideshow: false, animationSpeed: 300});   I can click until I'm blue, with no result
[18:49:12] <__joshua__> Fishy_: var value = $(td).text();  $(td).html($(<input/>).val(text));
[18:49:24] <__joshua__> er, that last text should be 'value'

[19:00:49] <saiyan> i mean from a server if you input a url instead of a file?
[19:00:59] <vladikoff> saiyan, oh thought you had your own page
[19:01:12] <saiyan> i did

[19:01:26] <saiyan> and tried to run it
[19:01:30] <saiyan> but it wouldnt explode

[19:24:30] <andytt> Can I get the value of checkbox in "Ext.form.FormPanel" using .prop? It always return false ... the code is too long and ugly, I have no idea how to paste it do jsfiddle. .. ..
[19:24:59] <tw2113> tried .attr() ?
[19:25:09] <tw2113> that may be wrong
[19:25:15] <tw2113> perhaps :checked ?
[19:25:36] <andytt> I've tried it ... always return same value all of them
[19:26:29] <sheilablackrose> hi guys. how do i set a css for all child regardless of how deep under .masterClass  to have color:red
[19:27:22] <zalem-developer> anyone know how to create action links for kendo treeview
[19:27:33] <andytt> here is the DOM .. http://jsfiddle.net/8f2Np/
[19:27:47] <zalem-developer> when you click a node, it calls an action on the controller
[19:37:09] <jsharpminor> How would I iterate through items with IDs of "item1" "item2" "item3" to find the first available number? So if I have "item1" "item2" and "item4" I'd be looking for ideally 3, but I'd take 5 as another valid answer.
[19:37:34] <jsharpminor> I tried   while($('*[id*=item' + count + ']').length() > 0), but it gave me an error.
[19:38:38] <Velveeta> what error did it give?
[19:39:27] <Velveeta> also, using that attribute selector like that is *probably* slower than using an id selector, i'm not sure if sizzle or the browser engine optimize that internally, but you could be using something like $('#item' + count).length instead
[19:39:37] <aitiba> I have a ajax get request that give me 200 code but goes to $.ajax error method. Here is the get response and the jquery code http://pastebin.com/jjYWjFaU Any ideas please?
[19:40:30] <jsharpminor> Veleveeta - But I don't know the entire item name. I only know that it *contains* item1.
[19:41:02] <Velveeta> so what's an example of an item id that would contain that format but not *be* that format? like 'item1sdf' ?
[19:41:15] <jsharpminor> Exactly.
[19:41:25] <Velveeta> aitiba: i don't see any reason that should be bouncing over to the error handler, nothing obvious anyway
[19:41:28] <jsharpminor> Or displayItem3 / editItem3 / etc
[19:41:35] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:41:54] <Velveeta> so what's the error being thrown?
[19:42:18] <jsharpminor> I dunno. Some dumb error message though.
[19:42:28] <jsharpminor> :-P
[19:42:28] <jsharpminor> TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[19:42:44] <jsharpminor> ( totally j-k about "some dumb message")
[19:43:38] <Velveeta> what happens if you console.log the object itself?
[19:44:00] <Velveeta> by the way, people... just in case your nightmares aren't creative enough... these things exist: http://theallegiant.com/swarms-of-giant-hornets-leave-41-dead-and-1600-injured/
[19:44:05] <jsharpminor> This is where I apologize and say that you just spoke Greek.
[19:44:29] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:44:54] <Velveeta> so right now you have this: while($('*[id*=item' + count + ']').length() > 0)
[19:45:09] <Velveeta> try something like this instead: var elements = $('*[id*=item' + count + ']').length() > 0; console.log(elements);
[19:45:30] <Velveeta> er, scrap the .length
[19:45:39] <Velveeta> var elements = $('*[id*=item' + count + ']'); console.log(elements);
[19:46:05] <aitiba> Is this a correct json format data: {'id':'1'} ?
[19:46:39] <Velveeta> aitiba: i'm pretty sure... the property names need to be quotes for a JSON.parse call, but i don't know that double-quotes are required
[19:46:51] <Velveeta> you may want to give it a try just in case though
[19:46:58] <Velveeta> {"id":"1"}
[19:50:02] <jsharpminor> The combination of humans using these insects as a food source and deforestation, the Asian Giant Hornet could be threatened with extinction if humans continue to remove their natural habitat.

[19:51:57] <jsharpminor> Or to take the other route, who do I contact to import a million of these delicacies?
[19:52:03] <jsharpminor> (For immediate discard, of course.)
[19:52:45] <aitiba> Now get ajax request, response with {"id":1} but I get Unexpected token :  on the response
[19:54:28] <jsharpminor> Conservation Status: <strike>Critically Endangered</strike> <strong>KILL! KILL!</strong>
[19:56:17] <Velveeta> "Where do I go to donate big bucks to unsustainable deforestation in that particular province?" -- lol
[19:56:55] <Velveeta> aitiba: this is difficult for me to advise on how to troubleshoot without seeing a working demo of some kind
[19:57:31] <jsharpminor> atitiba: try making a jsfiddle -- http://jsfiddle.net/
[19:57:50] <Velveeta> jsfiddle doesn't like working with ajax requests unfortunately
[19:57:55] <Velveeta> i'm not sure if jsbin does or not
[19:58:07] <Velveeta> but a live url would be beautiful if that's an option
[19:58:45] <aitiba> just a second
[20:02:47] <aitiba> c&p to a html file and open with the browser http://pastebin.com/CW46TvfY
[20:06:31] <aitiba> Velveeta: jsharpminor the demo http://pastebin.com/CW46TvfY
[20:12:21] <jsharpminor> Velveeta: Thanks so much. I got over the hump.
[20:13:27] <jsharpminor> Velveeta: Also a big thank you again to whoever posted that jQuery troubleshooting tips link. I read it through, even got to the "Help Vampire" section and realized that I was asking too many questions, and wasting my time and everybody else's by basically trying to outsource my job for free.
[20:14:11] <Fishy> Why wont my blur fire? http://jsbin.com/yegiqigi/1/
[20:35:12] <jsharpminor> How do I pick an element out of an array and work with it based on it having a parent with a certain ID?
[20:37:55] <kevireilly> jsharpminor: elems.forEach(function(elem, index){ if (elem.parent().attr('id') === 'certainID'){ /* do stuff */ } }); // untested guess
[20:38:02] <kevireilly> crap
[20:42:07] <bleathem> Velveeta: unfortunately my office never leaves my house ;)
[20:42:20] <bleathem> Velveeta: thanks for the e-mail
[20:42:29] <Jerbot1> But jsharpminor: where's certainID?
[20:42:38] <Jerbot1> Otherwise, you're not going to get a complete answer.
[20:43:17] <jsharpminor> kevireilly: No idea. But the .forEach(function(){ bit was what I was after. Thanks!!!!
[20:48:42] <bleathem> Velveeta: w.r.t. the state in the widget, it's isolated to the value reminaing in the timer.
[20:48:54] <bleathem> Velveeta: I can throw a running sample up somewhere if you are interested
[20:49:14] <bleathem> Velveeta: basically I'm interested in showcasing the following aspects of the widget factory:
[20:49:26] <bleathem> 1) Lifecycle + callbacks
[20:49:40] <bleathem> 2) Event handlers and triggering
[20:49:55] <bleathem> 3) Option mutating
[20:50:31] <bleathem> along with all the associated conventions and gotchas
[20:51:42] <pcfreak30> Could anyone help me out with this? http://jsbin.com/qeloqubu/1/ I am trying to get a set of buttons to be on the right on a fixed header.
[20:54:57] <CrazyZurfer> How can I debug javascript loaded with $('selector').load('somepagewithjs.html');
[20:56:39] <pcfreak30> CrazyZurfer: use the js debugger and console when the code runs?
[20:57:22] <CrazyZurfer> pcfreak30: the problem is that I can't see the line in which the error ocurrs because it says that is jquery's js line 2 (minified version, lol)
[20:59:14] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: chrome will "prettify" minified code.  Failing that, use the non-minifed version!?
[20:59:53] <pcfreak30> O_o, didnt know chrome had that ability
[21:00:28] <CrazyZurfer> bleathem: I don't understand what you are saying :S!... look.. try debuggin with load method... When I go to sources, the file doesn't appear and console throws the errors to jquerys file, not the loaded file
[21:01:14] <CrazyZurfer> for example: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined jquery-1.11.0.min.js:2 that error is not on jquery....js it is in the loaded page
[21:01:15] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: can you expand the stack of the error message to see where the error originated?
[21:01:41] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: what browser are you debuggin with?
[21:01:58] <CrazyZurfer> bleathem: Google chrome
[21:02:26] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: click the expand icon next to the error message in the console to see the strack trace of the error
[21:03:23] <CrazyZurfer> I can see it creates a VM7381 to explore which is the loaded file, but I doesn't show me where, or which line it is..
[21:08:14] <positr0n> hey
[21:08:15] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: weird, I dunno.  Maybe try loading the file statically until you can resolve the error
[21:08:36] <CrazyZurfer> bleathem: :/... I guess that's gonna be the only option
[21:10:25] <CrazyZurfer> Another thing.. How can I $.each over an Object? cause I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined on the $.each I guess because each if for arrays
[21:16:06] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[21:16:12] <bleathem> CrazyZurfer: look at the very last example
[21:18:45] <CrazyZurfer> cool.. working :)
[21:18:57] <andytt> HOW can I get state of checkbox in ExtJS? It always return false.... I've tried .is and .prop ...
[21:19:46] <andytt> Is it possible that checkboxes are not ready yet?
[23:53:28] <MagePsycho> how to call ajax on: 1. onclick="callSomeAjax()) 2. on pressing enter="callSomeAjax()"
