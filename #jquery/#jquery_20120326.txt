[00:00:27] <tetradon> are there any good tools for debugging syntax errors in jquery?
[00:07:39] <guest143029> $('div#subMenusContainer:nth-child(9) div.smOW ul.icesubMenu sub_level_1').css('left')); -- this isn't working
[00:08:01] <guest143029> what would be the best way to get at an nth-child of a menu element?
[00:08:14] <guest143029> I've tried using .eq(9)
[00:12:26] <stagen> nth-child(n9)
[00:16:29] <tetradon> I mean I can run a PHP script and I don't get any errors or warnings being output. I don't have any errors in my javascript code either. But I keep getting a syntax error.
[00:17:02] <tetradon> No errors are being reported. And my variables are all valid I believe as well
[00:21:53] <KarateKip3> i'm using jquery within Joomla. When I do .toggle() or .show() then the WHOLE list collapses/expands. I have made a clean html file with that script and everything works fine! What could be the problem?\
[00:45:27] <guest143029> KarateKip3:  have you made sure your actually using jQuery not mootools?
[00:45:48] <guest143029> cause I've run into $() based problems like this before
[00:58:54] <KarateKip3> guest143029:  put the whole code between (function($){...}(jQuery); so i suppose i am using only jquery there
[00:59:28] <marekw2143> what does "live" returns?
[00:59:34] <disappearedng> Any official jquery templating solutions?
[00:59:51] <timing> disappearedng: I use tmpl
[00:59:58] <KarateKip3> marekw2143: talking to me? what's "live"?
[01:00:02] <marekw2143> for example $(".someClass").live().unbind(); would always unbind any handlers from every element which has ".someClas")?
[01:00:02] <disappearedng> I thoguth they deprecated that
[01:00:06] <timing> disappearedng: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[01:00:14] <timing> yeah, well it still works :-)
[01:00:19] <disappearedng> it's officially unmainted
[01:00:24] <timing> and I didn't find a replacement
[01:00:32] <timing> but it still works :-)
[01:00:57] <marekw2143> KarateKip3: I woudl be happy if you would explain :)
[01:01:13] <larsemil> is there a general way to ajax a normal form using the form itself instead of reading all the values and sending them in a ajax function. like $('#form').ajaxinsteadofnormalaction(); :)
[01:01:29] <timing> larsemil: look at serialize
[01:02:26] <timing> larsemil: $.post($('#form').attr('action'), $('#form').serialize());
[01:05:28] <KarateKip3> marekw2143: explain about "live"? I don't know what that is, but i will give it a try and see what happens. Kinda difficult to post code because the whole joomla page (with mootools in it) is somehow responsible for this error. Explanation: i have a list of stuff. When i click on 1 stuff i want that stuff to expand. For example, a list of cars and when u click on a car the car should expand
[01:05:28] <KarateKip3> and show all properties of that car. This works fine in a plain HTML (code used from the official jQuery site). But when I implement the same code in Joomla, I see that ALL cars are expanded when you click on one.
[01:09:06] <marekw2143> KarateKip3: what ???
[01:10:47] <kapilkaisare> Greetings, all. I have a problem running an ajax/jsonp request via jquery in Firefox 3.6 where I keep running into a "jQuery<a whole lot of numbers> is not a function" error intermittently. Later versions of Firefox run this just fine. Has anyone seen this problem before? I'm running jQuery 1.5.1.
[01:20:41] <guest143029> KarateKip3: look up google about jQuery noConflict()
[01:21:40] <levu> is there any good documentation for avoiding javascript memleaks?
[01:22:01] <KarateKip3> guest143029: thnx, will look up noConflict()
[01:22:30] <guest143029> .show() & .toggle() have corresponding functions in MooTools
[01:23:22] <guest143029> so you could look up how they are used in the MooTools documentation and use something MooTools instead of jQuery (since Joomla is loading MooTools already).
[01:24:36] <KarateKip3> guest143029: ah ok, that's also a good plan, thnx!
[01:28:21] <guest143029> KarateKip3:  http://mootools.net/docs/more/Element/Element.Shortcuts ---- Just incase you have trouble finding it....
[01:30:53] <timing> larsemil: so did that work or do you saqy thanks by not saying anything?
[01:31:21] <larsemil> timing: That worked perfectly, exactly what i was looking for. Thank you very much! :)
[01:31:31] <larsemil> timing: easy to just code away when finally finding a solution. :)
[01:33:19] <stagen> Is there any alternatives to the hoverintent.js plugin built into jQuery these days?
[01:36:57] <larsemil> does anyone have a hint on why the animation "lags" and jumps on the wrong end in the slider here? http://voidab.destinator.se/
[01:47:40] <talin> hello. does jquery have something that allows me to put text next to a <select> in a form when a particular value in selected?
[01:47:47] <talin> or should i use regular js without using jquery?
[01:48:12] <talin> i want to write like "warning! blahblah" when an <option> that begins with 7 is selected
[01:48:25] <Cork> talin: you sould use a dom element and just set the text on change
[01:48:43] <Cork> or even better add a dom with the text
[01:48:48] <Cork> and just show it on the change event
[01:48:53] <talin> Cork: so there's no use to use jquery for this?
[01:49:00] <Cork> sure there is
[01:49:24] <Cork> jquery is meant to be used to manipulate dom elements
[01:51:04] <talin> Cork: well, without jquery, i can use the onChange property of a <select>
[01:51:10] <talin> Cork: i'm not sure how jquery does that
[01:51:31] <talin> but it has .change()
[01:51:54] <larsemil> talin: you could bind an event to the options you want to do something with. and if they are clicked/selected, show the dom element
[01:52:10] <dsdeiz> hi! is there a way to determine if there is still an ajax call that is still "processing"? i'm using a jquery plugin and need to determine if that call has been finished before i reload a page
[01:52:22] <Cork> talin: if($(this).val() === 'warning option') { $('#warning').show(); } else { $('#warning').hide(); }
[01:52:50] <Cork> dsdeiz: not without the xhr object
[01:53:13] <Cork> dsdeiz: you can bind a global ajaxStart and complete (i think)
[01:54:06] <talin> Cork: ah, thank you. i want to see if the number starts with 7 though, not just when it changes. so i guess i need some way of calling a function that tells me if the string starts with something
[01:54:40] <dsdeiz> ajaxStart?
[01:54:41] <Cork> talin: well you sould still need to use the change event
[01:54:45] <Cork> *would
[01:55:02] <Cork> dsdeiz: and ajaxStart and ajaxComplete
[01:55:18] <Cork> talin: you still want to check it on change though
[01:55:19] <dsdeiz> this one? http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[01:55:26] <Cork> dsdeiz: yes
[01:55:32] <dsdeiz> got it. thx!
[01:55:46] <larsemil> talin: if($(this).val()[0] === 7)
[01:56:02] <Cork> larsemil: that won't work :)
[01:56:22] <Cork> [0] won't be identical to 7
[01:57:35] <dsdeiz> oh hm, i'm not sure where to bind it tho.. what did you mean by 'global'?
[01:58:02] <larsemil> Cork: "7" then might be
[01:58:09] <Cork> yup
[02:00:53] <dsdeiz> great, think i got it. thanks!
[02:03:22] <crem> My selector matches 20000 nodes, is there a way to match only one? (first or any) I'm doing performance optimization, so matching 20000 and then taking first doesn't help.
[02:06:19] <beasty> is there a way to display " in a value ?
[02:07:43] <Cork> ?eval print('\"')
[02:07:45] <bot-t> Cork: "\""
[02:07:53] <Cork> ?eval print("\"")
[02:07:53] <bot-t> Cork: "\""
[02:07:59] <Cork> O_o'
[02:08:07] <Cork> wtf
[02:08:24] <Cork> beasty: anyway \" should work
[02:08:27] <tetradon> Are there any tools for debugging syntax errors in jquery?
[02:08:40] <Cork> tetradon: the browser?
[02:08:49] <beasty> Cork: yes i'm aware of that
[02:09:05] <beasty> Cork: i was wondering if there was a function for that ?
[02:09:11] <mindis|wurk> hola. anyone here use jquery filedrop? i'd like to know if it's possible to sniff the filetype somehow in it to prevent dropping of wrong types
[02:09:15] <Cork> no
[02:09:22] <tetradon> cork: yeah in the browser
[02:09:37] <Cork> tetradon: i meant use the browsers debug tools
[02:10:16] <Cork> mindis|wurk: i think you should be able to set what file types are accepted
[02:10:41] <Cork> mindis|wurk: at least d&d supports that in the browsers (never tried the plugin)
[02:11:14] <tetradon> Well I can't figure this out. It says there is an unexpected token. I call a PHP script asynchronously. The script is fine. I tested it and there weren't any errors or warnings output by it. And no errors are showing up either on the browser for any syntax errors. However, after the script is ran then I get a syntax error
[02:11:50] <Cork> tetradon: run your generated js through jslint
[02:12:11] <Cork> or set a breakpoint on hte row that throw the error and check what data it gets
[02:12:18] <Cork> hte==the
[02:14:17] <tetradon> cork: does this work for jquery?
[02:14:29] <Cork> tetradon: why wouldn't it?
[02:14:34] <Cork> js is written in js
[02:14:36] <Cork> uh..
[02:14:37] <tetradon> cork: I tried to run it and it couldn't recognize the $ sign
[02:14:43] <tetradon> ??
[02:14:44] <Cork> *jquery is written in js
[02:14:55] <beasty> ha!
[02:15:08] <tetradon> Cork:yeah I know that
[02:15:20] <Cork> tetradon: well ya, unless you include the framework it will complain on all the jquery functions
[02:15:30] <tetradon> Okay maybe I'm doing this wrong...ahhhh
[02:15:40] <Cork> tetradon: do you have a link?
[02:15:52] <tetradon> okay I assumed it would do that for me in jslint
[02:15:57] <tetradon> okay, I'll try again
[02:16:40] <palhmbs> crem:  you might be able to use .eq() - idk about the performance hit
[02:19:08] <crem> palhmbs, but this will match all elements anyway. Or matching is lazy in jQuery?
[02:19:31] <palhmbs> you can use :eq(index) instead of .eq()
[02:19:33] <palhmbs> also
[02:19:56] <Cork> no that won't help
[02:20:09] <Cork> all : is run on each match so :eq is the same as .eq
[02:20:28] <palhmbs> why not just use :eq(0) ?
[02:20:35] <Cork> its the same
[02:20:51] <Cork> :eq(0) will do the exact same thing as .eq(0)
[02:21:04] <Cork> except it will do a little more work as it goes through sizzle
[02:21:06] <palhmbs> if you don't want 1 dom match out of 20000, what's your actual problem?
[02:21:33] <palhmbs> change the html so it has a unique id, then use the id
[02:22:18] <Cork> ya, except changing the structure of the page so you can use a more limited selector, there isn't much you can do
[02:22:44] <tetradon> wow I found the error
[02:22:51] <tetradon> it was a really stupid one too
[02:22:55] <tetradon> thanks cork
[02:23:01] <Cork> np
[02:35:10] <djayb6> hello
[02:35:46] <djayb6> .ajaxComplet is meant to be executed after success callback has been fired right ?
[02:36:30] <Cork> its meant to be the last thing called yes
[02:36:35] <SuperRoach> yes djayb6
[02:36:41] <Cork> but not only after success
[02:36:48] <bigkevmcd> as long as you spell it correctly...
[02:37:20] <djayb6> it's weird because in my case ajaxComplete is fired before the success callback
[02:38:22] <SuperRoach> use .on for ajaxcomplete
[02:38:28] <SuperRoach> to check its being fired?
[02:39:41] <anli_> Can a datepicker be setup to automatically populate the text type="input" with the current date on start?
[02:43:37] <martz_> Hello all, iam currently checking out a tweet button. It is working quite nicely, however i want either the link, or the text for the tweet variable. But i dont know how to change the 'data-text' type in a <a>, anyone knows how to do this/knows what iam doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/czxUC/1/
[02:53:30] <bigkevmcd> martz_: you want to look .data
[02:53:44] <bigkevmcd> martz_: oops...you want to look at .data
[02:54:16] <palhmbs> martz_:  as far as I can tell, you'd have to get your script to remove then recreate the button all over again
[02:54:19] <MacroMan> This Ajax works in Chrome and FF but not in IE :http://pastebin.com/zk6d2wyA
[02:54:35] <MacroMan> Any one able to see if there is anything wrong with the code?
[02:54:54] <smares> cheers guys! is it possible to halt a form submit, process some data and then resume the submit?
[02:55:41] <smares> with prototype I was able to accomplish this by using Event.stop(theSubmitEvent) and then calling submit() on the form at a later time
[02:55:58] <smares> calling submit() in prototype didn't retrigger the submit event handler
[02:56:02] <MacroMan> smares: use .preventDefault() followed by .submit() to submit the form
[02:56:19] <smares> and submit() doesn't retrigger the handler?
[02:56:44] <smares> I am calling it in a callback function of an ajax call
[02:57:25] <yue__> Hey!i need to find out using jquery if my page has an image. Am using Drupal. Please help!
[02:57:42] <MacroMan> smares: Hmm. not too sure on that one. .submit() has always worked for me.
[02:58:33] <smares> I could probably work with a flag if everything else fails :)
[02:59:03] <smares> and do my logic only the first time submit is called
[02:59:36] <MacroMan> tue__: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/element-exists/
[02:59:46] <MacroMan> yue__: link above
[03:00:22] <MacroMan> $('img').length == 0; // no element found
[03:02:30] <yue__> MacroMan:thanks ...will check itout
[03:04:00] <cheshair> Hi everybody, I have a form and want to disable submit button when input field is empty. How can I do that?
[03:08:18] <yue__> Another Q.the image field doesn't have any id or class. I can reach it using multiple classes above it. But how do i write it in jquery selector $("") ? like row>col>field-content>img
[03:09:31] <djayb6> cheshair if ( $('input[name="something"].val().length == 0 ) { $('input:submit').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); }
[03:10:03] <djayb6> i forgot a ')
[03:10:12] <djayb6> after something"]
[03:10:14] <cheshair> djayb6, great help! thank you very much!!
[03:11:51] <reisi> using the jquery ui tabs; how does one get the selected tab? event.target on "tabsselect" is the div initialized as tabs
[03:16:01] <Eviltwin> $('input[name="something"]').change(function() { if($(this).val()) { $('input:submit').removeAttr("disabled") } else { $('input:submit').attr("disabled", "disabled") } });
[03:16:18] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps keyup instead of change
[03:17:24] <yue__> How to write multiple classes and img together in a jquery as intersection of these
[03:17:44] <yue__> jquery selector
[03:19:44] <Eviltwin> img.foo.bar matches all <IMG> tags with both class foo and class bar
[03:20:12] <Nomikos> yeah, same as in CSS
[03:21:12] <talin> i am trying to trigger an alert when someones writes into one of my textfields
[03:21:18] <talin> and the value they write begins with 7
[03:21:21] <talin> http://jsfiddle.net/3TD8H/1/
[03:21:27] <talin> but it doesn't do anything
[03:21:46] <Eviltwin> Use keyup instead
[03:21:55] <Eviltwin> of change
[03:22:24] <talin> Eviltwin: was that for me?
[03:22:28] <Eviltwin> Yes
[03:22:36] <v_y> is there a way to get .ajax to parse a response with content-type text/html as json? or do i have to JSON.parse manually?
[03:22:46] <v_y> i cannot change the servers content-type response
[03:23:31] <yue__> img tag doesnt have any class or id...but its container divs do....how do i specify that in the selector
[03:23:51] <talin> Eviltwin: that triggers alert every time i open teh page
[03:25:00] <Nomikos> v_y: you can specify 'json' as the last parameter of say, the .post() method
[03:25:14] <Nomikos> pretty sure there's similar for the other ajax shortcuts
[03:25:28] <yue__> talin: maybe .focus() can help you
[03:25:33] <Xotix1> if i have a form with target=_blank, a new tabs open. Can i have the same but for an iframe on the existing page?
[03:25:34] <Nomikos> .. as for .ajax() (I really need to finish my coffee), should be a setting too
[03:25:48] <Xotix1> or catch it somehow and do something
[03:28:52] <Nomikos> Xotix1: you mean target=foo where the iframe is named foo?
[03:29:37] <Eviltwin> v_y: First, is using JSON.parse or $.parseJSON really that hard?
[03:29:38] <Xotix1> Nomikos, yes. Instead of a new tab, open a new iframe e.g. in a layer.
[03:29:51] <Nomikos> oh a /new/ iframe
[03:29:53] <Eviltwin> Second, look at the dataType setting
[03:30:26] <Xotix1> Nomikos, can be an already existing iframe. doesn't matter.
[03:30:45] <Xotix1> But just don't open the redirect in a new tab but in an iframe.
[03:30:52] <Nomikos> Xotix1: for existing iframe use name & target as I mentioned above, that's simply html
[03:31:22] <Nomikos> Xotix1: for new iframe.. any reason it has to be an iframe? you can just load html into a div or other element?
[03:31:23] <yue__> Is it possible to reuse an image currently in the page when some event occurs, using jquery?if yes, how?
[03:31:27] <Xotix1> Nomikos hopefully itworks thanks ! :)
[03:31:38] <Nomikos> Xotix1: iframes complicate scripting
[03:32:11] <Xotix1> Nomikos, i know.
[03:32:19] <Xotix1> Don't have to touch it again
[03:32:30] <Nomikos> Famous last words :-)
[03:33:05] <talin> yue__: i am testing .focus() now
[03:35:11] <MacroMan> Can anyone see why this doesn't work in IE, but does in Chrome and FF: http://pastebin.com/zk6d2wyA
[03:35:46] <Eviltwin> Do you use the same ID more than once in the page?
[03:36:11] <talin> http://jsfiddle.net/2eThH/ trying to get it to check the value of the field with focus, but it doesn't ever do anything
[03:36:31] <Eviltwin> talin: That's not how it works
[03:36:38] <Nomikos> id=1, IE might trip over that
[03:36:47] <MacroMan> Eviltwin: If that was directed at me, then no I don't
[03:36:48] <Nomikos> hasn't always been valid
[03:37:00] <Eviltwin> talin: All you needed to do was change a few characters from what you had before
[03:37:16] <Eviltwin> talin: Instead of .on("change", you needed .on("keyup"
[03:37:26] <MacroMan> Does IE not like ID's that are numbers?
[03:37:43] <Nomikos> Not sure, but it /used/ to be not valid html until not long ago
[03:38:06] <Nomikos> if you can get IE to spit out any error message or see where it stops executing that'd be helpful also, of course
[03:38:26] <Eviltwin> MacroMan: "ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[03:38:46] <MacroMan> Ah OK. That aside, I don't think that's the problem. I've commented out those lines, to leave only the .load() and it still doesn't load anything
[03:39:03] <yue__> talin: there is .keyup() , .keydown(), .keypress() functions...........you said .keyup() didnt work? try .keydown()
[03:39:28] <MacroMan> Or could it be caused just because they exisrt on the page?
[03:40:28] <Nomikos> hmyeah, id restrictions have been relaxed only in html5, not that many browsers are fully compliant yet
[03:40:53] <Nomikos> (for whatever value "compliant" has with a moving target spec)
[03:41:11] <yue__> img tag doesnt have any class or id...but its container divs do....how do i specify that in the selector...........     .class.class img ...but thats not correct is it?   :( Please help!
[03:41:25] <Nomikos> yue__: looks fine to me
[03:42:02] <Nomikos> yue__: if the two specified classes are for the same element, at least - if they're for different but nested elements, put a space in between. it's regular css still
[03:42:40] <talin> yue__: all those trigger when i open the page, but never after that
[03:43:42] <yue__> Nomikos: thanks will try again
[03:46:32] <Xotix1> Nomikos: thanks a lot :D
[03:46:42] <amirite> anyone use javascript mvc
[03:49:35] <talin> http://jsfiddle.net/2eThH/2/ now it does trigger, but it doesn't show the field value
[03:50:58] <quicksilver> talin: yes it does.
[03:51:14] <quicksilver> talin: the point of jsfiddle is to create demos people can actually test
[03:51:21] <quicksilver> not just paste a fragment of javascript.
[03:51:35] <quicksilver> talin: your fiddle now working : http://jsfiddle.net/2eThH/3/
[03:54:19] <talin> quicksilver: hmm... why does it always work on jsfiddle and never in my code :(
[03:54:34] <talin> quicksilver: on my page, it doesn't do anything unless i write in the field and tehn press TAB
[03:54:39] <quicksilver> talin: because your code is broken in ways I can only guess at having not seen it.
[03:54:51] <quicksilver> possibilities : that isn't the ID of an INPUT?
[03:54:58] <quicksilver> you use the ID more than once?
[03:55:06] <quicksilver> you don't have jquery loaded when you run that handler?
[03:55:14] <quicksilver> you load that item via ajax so the selector isn't applied?
[03:55:24] <yue__> Nomikos: lovely...its finally working!! :)thanks.....i often get jumbled up with the simplest things!!! o.O
[03:55:31] <quicksilver> unfortunately my crystal ball is failing today.
[03:55:50] <talin> quicksilver: it is the correct ID, but i'll see if i've used it more than once
[03:56:08] <Nomikos> yue__: glad I could help
[03:56:11] <talin> quicksilver: only used once, and <input> ID is correct
[03:58:02] <talin> quicksilver: i pasted my code into jsfiddle, and it works there, but not in my browser
[03:58:29] <Xotix1> is there a difference between submit() and bind(submit)?
[04:00:04] <cheshair> i am trying to fix this: http://dpaste.com/721482/ I hope my goal is self-evident. Any tips?
[04:06:04] <recentlydeceased> I'm using an inarray prototype which worked fine with a simple array (12,22,64, etc), but now I have an associative array (name:jim, age: 12, name:bob, age: 22, etc) and I want to use the inarray to check the value of age.  Arrays and objects have got me stumped.  Any ideas?
[04:06:46] <anli_> Strange, I always get the 3rd tab choosen in my jquery ui tabs, is there any certain reason for that?
[04:06:57] <quicksilver> cheshair: that is utterly broken.
[04:07:14] <recentlydeceased> the inarray prototype is http://pastebin.com/iDUEGNnG
[04:07:18] <cheshair> quicksilver, yep i know, is there a way to fix it up?
[04:08:15] <quicksilver> cheshair: (1) you never close the '(' you open at '$(input'. (2) $ is not a member of this, you don't write 'this.$' (3) the selector argument to $ is a string, if you want to pass a literal you use quotes, like $('input')
[04:08:34] <coppa> aaaah quicksilver exact
[04:08:55] <quicksilver> cheshair: try this : http://dpaste.com/721486/
[04:09:06] <cheshair> quicksilver, ok, plenty of things to fix. I'll fix them and come back in amminute
[04:09:31] <cheshair> quicksilver, you did that for me?? too kind of you!! thank you very much!
[04:10:41] <quicksilver> cheshair: np. I didn't test it it might still not work but it's closer...
[04:11:15] <jpic> hi all, will $.getScript() take relative paths from the script that calls it or from window.location.href ?
[04:12:20] <jpic> it doesn't seem to be the case, how to make it so ?
[04:19:26] <yue__> jpic: what do you want to do?
[04:21:28] <Nomikos> jpic: since it's executed from the browser context (I guess?), most likely from the window.location
[04:21:49] <cheshair> quicksilver, your snippet works smoothly! I would like that  browser looks for input[name="comment"] only within current form. Is this the snippet behaviour?
[04:22:04] <knickabocka> http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/7/ every time i drop my li to the ne ul i wont to show it in a new bg color.. is this possible?
[04:22:12] <quicksilver> cheshair: no.
[04:22:29] <quicksilver> cheshair: change it from $('input...) to $(this).find('input...
[04:22:44] <cheshair> quicksilver, wonderful!
[04:23:32] <Nomikos> knickabocka: sure
[04:25:09] <knickabocka> Nomikos: how
[04:25:26] <xec> knickabocka: something like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/8/
[04:25:28] <knickabocka> triggers?
[04:25:44] <talin> is there a keyup-equivalent that only checks when you unfocus the field?
[04:25:59] <talin> because i want to check when a field is unselected, not after every character you input
[04:26:34] <knickabocka> xec: but the old rows have to stay in 2 different colors
[04:26:37] <quicksilver> talin: blur
[04:26:46] <xec> knickabocka: i'm not sure what you mean
[04:27:30] <talin> quicksilver: thanks again, that is perfect
[04:27:39] <knickabocka> xec: no sorry wrong. the source li
[04:27:45] <knickabocka> have to chance color
[04:28:00] <knickabocka> first drag green, second yellow, third red
[04:29:23] <Nomikos> fourth also red I guess?
[04:29:32] <xec> knickabocka: http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/10/ ?
[04:29:36] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/11/ is close but it loops back to green :-)
[04:30:47] <theCole> why are you using javascript to do this? why don't you just use HTML5?
[04:30:57] <knickabocka> :) great ppl.. but i want to change the bg-color of the "source-li" not the "destination-li". my first description was wrong sry
[04:31:07] <xec> Nomikos: i think this is closer to what he means http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/12/
[04:31:10] <theCole> http://html5demos.com/drag
[04:31:23] <Nomikos> ha, yes
[04:31:30] <Nomikos> ^ xec
[04:31:43] <raj> I want to append an existing dom object to a newly created one...so I'm thinking I have to declare the newly created one as a var...correct?
[04:32:34] <knickabocka> xec: u got it!
[04:32:43] <jpic> yue__: i want to refactor a jquery script, make a lib.js with functions that are ment to be used in both list.js and form.js (each used in a different page)
[04:32:52] <jpic> i thought i could make list.js load lib.js and same for form.js
[04:32:57] <Nomikos> knickabocka: http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/13/ ?
[04:33:06] <jpic> but i'm not going to hardcode absolute urls
[04:33:32] <knickabocka> http://jsfiddle.net/NphuN/12/ is the winner!
[04:33:49] <knickabocka> and 13 too!!!
[04:33:52] <Nomikos> theCole: one reason is that more browsers support the jQuery way than new HTML5 features
[04:33:56] <xec> knickabocka: but it keeps going back to green, 13 does not
[04:33:58] <knickabocka> thx <3
[04:34:10] <stagen> Any of you lot experienced with hoverIntent.js?
[04:35:42] <yue__> sorry jpic ....i wont be able to help with that :(
[04:35:43] <xec> ?anyone
[04:35:43] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[04:36:25] <stagen> *Are any of you lot experienced with hoverintent.js
[04:36:25] <raj> I'm trying to accomplish what my comments indicate here http://paste.ofcode.org/AiS9WPeWphQiUB7U8Fn5qu
[04:36:32] <stagen> Happy now, xec?
[04:36:44] <talin> i have a field $("#id_blah")... i want to find its length. i tried .length() and .val().length(); without much luck
[04:37:18] <xec> stagen: no, i'm severely depressed. bot-t is trying so hard to let you know that you can just ask a question - not look for topic experts
[04:37:18] <raj> stagen, no
[04:37:21] <Nomikos> talin: you want to find the length of that element, or its value, or its width?
[04:37:36] <talin> Nomikos: the length of the data in the textfield
[04:37:37] <Nomikos> talin: the length of the element should be 1, since ids are unique
[04:37:46] <xec> stagen: i'm happy when bot-t is happy ;)
[04:37:53] <talin> Nomikos: i guess .val().length() then?
[04:37:58] <stagen> Alright, I'll be more specific
[04:38:17] <Nomikos> talin: I think so yeah, my string methods are hazy
[04:39:05] <talin> Nomikos: it was .length without hte () for some reason
[04:39:24] <Nomikos> talin: .. yes, hazy :-) I should have spotted that
[04:39:33] <Nomikos> it's a property, not a method
[04:40:47] <raj> I'm trying to collect dom data in an arbitrary dom object, and then pull my collected data outta the container and put it as the html of another dom object, here is my code--> http://paste.ofcode.org/AiS9WPeWphQiUB7U8Fn5qu
[04:41:27] <raj> not sure how to create that temporary dom object (i.e. new_sort)
[04:42:19] <stagen> xec: I've included hoverintent.js to prevent a queue of events when the user randomly hovers over an element for a short moment. Then I've tried to replace my .toggle() with the functions needed by hoverIntent - but now I get a console error for the jquery: http://paste.ofcode.org/ttdJPE8CdShDewuFizwaGZ
[04:42:49] <stagen> xec: now the question is, where is the problem located, I can't find the problem.
[04:43:35] <xec> stagen: what is the error? also, could you make it a live demo - see ?demo
[04:43:36] <bot-t> stagen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:43:59] <stagen> gimme a moment, might actually have found a fix
[04:44:08] <xec> but this doesn't look right at all
[04:45:14] <stagen> This is the error: "function statement requires a name
[04:45:14] <stagen> function(){ // over"
[04:45:30] <Xotix1> How do i get fancybox's iframe?
[04:45:38] <xec> where does that first function end?
[04:46:10] <stagen> Nevermind xec, I worked it out. Stupid error on my part really.
[04:46:14] <xec> stagen: sorry but this is messy. i believe hoverIntent takes two arguments
[04:46:16] <xec> ah okay
[04:46:51] <stagen> Yea, it's the active and deactive arguments
[04:47:44] <xec> yes, either inline functions or named function references
[04:48:14] <stagen> ayep, fixed it now - much cleaner
[04:48:57] <stagen> Anyway, thanks for even giving it a glance. :)
[04:50:45] <raj> xec, mind taking a look at my paste?
[04:51:44] <xec> raj: what are you trying to do
[04:51:58] <xec> what does the markup look like
[04:52:19] <raj> I'm trying to build up a dom object filled with selects, and then place all those selects into '.sort_form'
[04:52:34] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/11/
[04:53:24] <raj> it's so I can place those select values back into the sort_form (retrieved from the server) when a page is refreshed
[04:54:20] <phil-adept> afternoon all. Does anyone have any experience with debugging uploadify errors?
[04:54:43] <xec> if you want to store something between refreshes you need to store it somewhere outside the DOM, like on the server or a cookie
[04:54:59] <raj> yeah
[04:55:02] <raj> that's what I'm doing
[04:55:05] <raj> now I'm trying to put it all back
[04:55:12] <raj> using this code http://paste.ofcode.org/AiS9WPeWphQiUB7U8Fn5qu
[04:55:13] <Whirl3d> raj, why don't you just have a div with a ul in it and each new sort term woudl be a li. Then, you would have ONE select field that you would keep up to date with only the valid options and it would just add to the ul
[04:55:34] <xec> raj: ok, what does sort_choices contain?
[04:57:02] <raj> {'sortby_1':'cats', 'sortby_2':'dogs'}
[04:57:13] <xec> raj: also, what Whirl3d just said makes sense, looks like a lot of selects for little gain
[04:57:39] <raj> what's the loss of the selects?
[04:58:00] <xec> what?
[04:58:11] <raj> i'm actually not quite sure what Whirl3d means
[04:59:04] <xec> he's saying maybe you only need one select - and you could fill a list with what you select
[04:59:27] <raj> fill a list?
[04:59:30] <raj> an array?
[04:59:51] <xec> like <ul> <li>
[05:00:01] <raj> right, an unordered list of what?
[05:00:11] <xec> of sort orders
[05:00:20] <xec> isn't that what you're making?
[05:00:23] <raj> so each <select> sits beside an <li>
[05:00:24] <raj> ?
[05:00:26] <xec> i mean, you tell me
[05:00:32] <xec> no
[05:00:50] <raj> how can I have multiple sortby selections with only one select?
[05:00:58] <xec> you store them in a list
[05:01:32] <raj> and only show each select once?
[05:01:50] <raj> so after sortby_1 has been selected, replace it with sortby_2?
[05:01:57] <D4> if I inspect 'network' in chrome, and I see "keep-alive" = min: 10, does this mean 10sec or 1sec?
[05:02:09] <D4> or timeout = 10
[05:02:24] <D4> Keep-Alive:timeout=10, max=98 <-- what does this mean? :)
[05:02:26] <xec> raj: there is no "each select" - only one
[05:02:44] <raj> i don't know how I can have multiple sort criteria with 1 <select>
[05:02:54] <xec> 2 sec
[05:05:49] <xec> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/8UpQq/
[05:06:23] <raj> oh, that's actually pretty clever
[05:06:29] <raj> although i like my usability a bit more
[05:06:52] <Whirl3d> what's the easiest way to get the selected option. Not it's value, but the option element itself
[05:07:00] <xec> that's the basic idea, of course you would need to add some logic to remove items from the list (and unavailable from the dropdown)
[05:07:28] <xec> Whirl3d: try :selected
[05:07:33] <raj> i understand, I like the flexibility of the selects though
[05:08:09] <raj> does it make sense what I'm trying to accomplish here though? http://paste.ofcode.org/AiS9WPeWphQiUB7U8Fn5qu
[05:09:45] <xec> raj: you get the key from $.each() already
[05:09:52] <Whirl3d> raj, here ya go. NOw you just need to re-add the items and make them removable...
[05:09:59] <raj> i basically wanna collect all the selects in a single place outside the iterator, and then throw it all into .sort_form
[05:10:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ayfX9/5/
[05:10:20] <Whirl3d> You can even drag sort the priority after selected
[05:10:39] <xec> raj: $.each({ whoa: "test" }, function(key, val) { /* key = "whoa" */});
[05:11:03] <xec> s/=/===
[05:11:38] <raj> xec, what's that?
[05:11:57] <xec> it's a loop, iterating through object keys
[05:12:20] <raj> Whirl3d, very interesting functionality, but I don't believe it's as intuitive
[05:12:20] <phil-adept> Does anyone have any experience with debugging uploadify errors?
[05:13:05] <raj> xec, i'm already iterating through it
[05:13:13] <raj> you mean you don't like how i've done it?
[05:13:15] <xec> raj: yes but your code is a mess
[05:13:18] <raj> oh
[05:13:52] <raj> our code looks the same
[05:13:56] <xec> raj: you dont need the var key = line
[05:13:56] <xec> which is a loop in itself
[05:14:01] <xec> what
[05:14:14] <raj> why don't I need the var key?
[05:14:26] <xec> because $.each() already gives it to you
[05:14:42] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[05:15:00] <Xotix1> does someone know fancybox and can tell me how i can make a form which has target=fancybox iframe"?
[05:15:51] <Whirl3d> detach doesn't destroy the option, does it?
[05:16:05] <Cork> no
[05:16:22] <Cork> it just removes the link to the parent
[05:16:57] <raj> Whirl3d, you are hell bent on changing my UI, huh?
[05:17:42] <raj> xec, in my code, I have function(i,obj), which is equivalent to your function(key,val), no?
[05:17:58] <Whirl3d> I could really give a shit less about your ui. I just found a project that had something similar and was able to get better results in less code and less hassle than you have had in three days of trying to get this resolved.
[05:18:03] <Whirl3d> I just thought I'd share
[05:18:05] <raj> `i` is just an index though, and obj is the whole object
[05:18:18] <xec> raj: no, i would be the key
[05:18:26] <raj> Whirl3d, the UI is resolved as of last night
[05:18:36] <raj> i'm just trying to reload the choices from session
[05:18:39] <xec> raj: you're iterating through an object, not an array
[05:18:42] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/6/ - how do I load entire HTML pages into each jQuery Cycle <li>?
[05:18:45] <mikkelb> I'm trying to make the simplest, coolest way to showcase static HTML pages - say for ones portfolio, investors, friends and family or what not.
[05:18:52] <raj> xec, i = 0
[05:19:00] <raj> in my first iteration
[05:19:25] <raj> obj is the whole object
[05:19:28] <raj> not just the value
[05:19:41] <xec> so you lied about what the value was
[05:19:43] <xec> ;O
[05:20:11] <raj> [
[05:20:11] <raj> Object
[05:20:11] <raj> ,
[05:20:11] <raj> Object
[05:20:14] <raj> ]
[05:20:16] <mikkelb> xec: I've known raj for quite some time, he's not a liar ;)
[05:20:22] <xec> raj: that is an array
[05:20:30] <raj> damnit, you are right
[05:20:32] <raj> so sorry about that
[05:20:57] <mikkelb> Well there was one time he lied to the cops telling them the girl was over 18
[05:21:05] <xec> mikkelb: hehe, "lied" was a bit strong in this case i guess ;)
[05:21:08] <raj> cuz each selectbox is an object, and they are all collected into an array
[05:22:19] <raj> but my point is, I'm trying collect all the select's i'm about to load into the page, all into a single place, so then I can use $('.sort_form').html(new_sort)
[05:22:26] <raj> where new_sort is the collection of selects
[05:23:03] <xec> raj: ok, what do you get (what is sort_choices) and what do you want the output to be
[05:23:24] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/6/ - can someone help me complete this cute little showcase app? I'll gladly pay!
[05:24:21] <raj> xec, I'm basically using sort_choices to build up my selectboxes as they were before the page was refreshed
[05:25:25] <xec> mikkelb: maybe this is a better plugin choice, i know it was made with html content in mind http://css-tricks.com/examples/AnythingSlider/
[05:26:11] <mikkelb> xec: Generally is this plugin more loved and cherished by developers than jQuery Cycle?
[05:26:44] <xec> honestly, i have no idea - don't like sliders personally and therefore never used one ;)
[05:27:12] <xec> but, of all the ones i researched, this one stood out
[05:27:31] <ravenzz> this is cool as well http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[05:29:03] <mikkelb> xec: Last commit was 3 years ago!!! https://github.com/dcneiner/AnythingSlider
[05:29:09] <raj> so should I just make an arbitrary div and stack the selects in there before using .html to move them all into '.sort_form'?
[05:29:32] <VictorCL> in jquerymobile,  if the page I am linking I need to refresh the <head> part .. do I must use data-ajax="false" ???
[05:29:33] <mikkelb> ravenzz: looks solid!
[05:29:44] <xec> mikkelb: i don't think dcneiner is the author
[05:30:14] <xec> so, most likely a fork
[05:31:33] <xec> mikkelb: https://github.com/ProLoser/AnythingSlider/ 6 days ago
[05:31:34] <mikkelb> xec: oh i see
[05:34:24] <mikkelb> So say I change the slider plugin at http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/7/ - how do I get an external URL into the #viewport?
[05:35:39] <xec> what? external url?
[05:35:55] <xec> to what, exactly
[05:36:33] <mikkelb> Yes I'm trying to load http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/index1.html into the first #viewport li, and http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/index2.html into the second
[05:36:46] <Clex> s
[05:37:40] <crem> I have a html text in a varaible, which I want to show in iframe, but I also want to insert <base> tag so images are shown. If I do $(htmlText), it strips contents of <head></head>, and if assign htmlText to iframe content()s innerHtml, it loads all images before I add <base> tag. Any suggestions?
[05:42:28] <raj> so xec? am I okay in my approach of adding the modified $select_template to a container? I rearranged the code a little http://paste.ofcode.org/isKtYV9v4ZREEtD7dVWqv7
[05:45:09] <Xotix1> how do i get a form's target? attr somehow doesn't seem to work.
[05:48:31] <Xotix1> http://jsfiddle.net/sJ2G8/3/ why can't i get my form?
[05:50:18] <johnkpaul> Xotix1: you're forgeting the #
[05:50:31] <johnkpaul> $("#myForm")
[05:50:36] <johnkpaul> used to Prototype? :)
[05:50:48] <raj> oh nice, johnkpaul
[05:50:50] <raj> :)
[05:51:24] <Xotix1> johnkpaul: thanks…. never touched prototype
[05:51:34] <johnkpaul> no problem
[05:51:57] <raj> maybe u can tell me, I'm trying to store up my $select_templates so I can then build up sortboxes http://paste.ofcode.org/isKtYV9v4ZREEtD7dVWqv7
[05:52:29] <raj> basically, sort_choices is an array of objects
[05:52:35] <raj> each object only has 1 key, and 1 value
[05:52:47] <raj> the key is the 'name' attribute's value
[05:53:03] <raj> and the value of that key is the .val() of the select box
[05:53:09] <xec> raj: i can't help you without knowing exactly what your input (sort_choices) is and what you want outputted
[05:53:18] <xec> is that a word? outputted?
[05:53:25] <raj> it is now
[05:53:31] <xec> :D
[05:53:39] <xec> it is! http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outputted
[05:53:48] <raj> [{'sortby_1':'cat'}, {'sortby_2':'dog'}]
[05:53:56] <raj> that's sort_choices
[05:54:24] <raj> I'm using this to get data to my server http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/11/
[05:54:37] <raj> and then I'd like to rebuild what the user submitted in case of page refresh
[05:54:48] <raj> which is what I'm trying to accomplish with http://paste.ofcode.org/isKtYV9v4ZREEtD7dVWqv7
[05:55:23] <raj> that paste.ofcode.org code is supposed to make the sortboxes look just like how the user last left it
[05:56:27] <raj> i should add $select_template.val(obj[key]); under $select_template.attr('name', key);
[05:56:57] <xec> raj: inside your loop you keep overwriting the $select_template's name rather than making a new clone
[05:58:05] <raj> xec, $select_template is supposed to be appended to temp_sort_container though
[05:58:07] <recentlydeceased> how can I select and change a specific option in a select?  let's say option 11?
[05:58:10] <iamjarvo> whats the trick to specify selectors on multiple lines. basically clean this up http://pastie.org/3671531
[05:58:13] <raj> that way I don't mind that $select_template is overwritten
[05:58:31] <raj> i commented the line out cuz I haven't properly defined temp_sort_container yet
[05:59:29] <xec> raj: well, why don't you just select whatever container you want the selects inside, on line 4
[06:00:11] <raj> xec, cuz there's already one selectbox in the container
[06:00:14] <raj> when the page loads
[06:00:22] <raj> so i can't append
[06:00:42] <raj> and I can't do .html cuz the additional selects coming from the loop
[06:00:43] <xec> you want to remove the original selectbox?
[06:01:07] <raj> hmm
[06:01:07] <raj> yes
[06:01:18] <raj> ok, i guess i could just do that
[06:01:43] <Xotix1> can someone help me setting the iframes target to fancybox's iframe? the problem is, it doesn't exist form the beginning, as far as i know. http://jsfiddle.net/sJ2G8/4/
[06:02:33] <xec> raj: i would do it on the first iteration inside the loop, just to make sure you don't remove it if there are nothing in sort_choices
[06:02:42] <xec> there is*
[06:03:00] <raj> like if i = 0 ?
[06:03:04] <xec> right
[06:03:08] <raj> gotcha
[06:03:12] <xec> but === rather than = :D
[06:03:30] <raj> i've actually got the whole thing enclosed in if(data['sort_choces'] !== null), so we're safe :)
[06:03:43] <raj> yeah, and that :)
[06:03:50] <xec> well, it could be an empty array
[06:04:07] <raj> my server returns null if the array is empty
[06:05:26] <Xotix1> how can i wait until an element is loaded/exists?
[06:07:03] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/8/ (minimalistic presentation app for HTML pages) - how do I load http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/index1.html into the first #viewport <li>?
[06:07:28] <recentlydeceased> the following code disables a select --	$("#select").attr('disabled','disabled');  -- how do I disable a specific option, instead of the whole select?
[06:07:28] <Jon47> Xotix1 there's no inherent way to do this in the DOM or jquery, you need to use your own architecture to solve this
[06:10:14] <xec> ?load @ mikkelb
[06:10:14] <bot-t> mikkelb, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:10:17] <Jon47> recentlydeceased: according to the docs http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/option.html the "option" element should also support the "disabled" attribute - I think .prop('disabled', true) is the best way to go about it - though I don't know how every browser handles it…
[06:10:28] <xec> crap, that's the wrong load, hold on
[06:10:42] <mikkelb> hmm
[06:10:50] <xec> mikkelb: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[06:11:19] <recentlydeceased> Jon47, cheers, looks like $("#select option[value='1']").attr("disabled","disabled"); is the way to go, but I want to specify the value using a variable
[06:11:28] <Xotix1> if can check e.g. $().attr(name) == 'undefined' right?
[06:12:17] <mikkelb> xec: interesting!
[06:12:36] <converge> I have this www.fortunata.com.br/ website but it's take too long to open the index page because it opens a lot of images for the catalog, is there some way jQuery could help me loading the images ? maybe just load the images when the user click or something like it ?
[06:12:52] <xec> mikkelb: i assume the page is on the same domain, though
[06:13:15] <xec> mikkelb: the nice thing about .load() is you can easily filter on a selector, just get the content you want
[06:14:38] <mikkelb> sounds really nice man
[06:14:45] <mikkelb> http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/9/ am i on the right path?
[06:14:53] <Xotix1> http://jsfiddle.net/sJ2G8/5/ why do i get undefined?
[06:15:17] <mikkelb> and a little something-something here: http://home.no/reddvinylene/4xec.mp3

[06:16:19] <xec> mikkelb: more like http://jsfiddle.net/hN6c5/10/
[06:16:25] <xec> iirc
[06:16:44] <xec> no
[06:16:59] <converge> mikkelb: that sounds is good
[06:17:16] <xec> mikkelb: more like $("#viewport li:first-child").load("url selector")
[06:17:31] <xec> just a space between the url and the filter selector
[06:17:54] <ender456> i have a sub-menu on my navbar that when clicked on the submenuitem it goes to a section and opens it using .show().  However, this only works if i am on a different page.  if i am on the page itself the sub menu nav items dont open the text.  what can i do
[06:18:13] <xec> mikkelb: hehe, what's that mp3
[06:18:36] <mikkelb> xec: not quite there unfortunately - http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/12/
[06:18:42] <mikkelb> that mp3 is for you man!
[06:18:54] <mikkelb> dunno if you'll like it but..
[06:20:01] <xec> mikkelb: hehe, thanks - you made it?
[06:21:23] <xec> mikkelb: http://jsfiddle.net/hN6c5/13/
[06:21:56] <xec> mikkelb: it won't work on the jsfiddle because of same origin policy
[06:22:52] <ender456> http://pastie.org/3671667
[06:24:40] <mikkelb> xec: yup thanks man!
[06:24:42] <ender456> is there a jquery code that refreshes a page?
[06:25:14] <xec> ender456: you could just write to window.location
[06:25:26] <ender456> ill give that a try now
[06:25:32] <xec> ender456: window.location = window.location; would refresh iirc
[06:26:09] <raj> thanks xec, looks like i got it solved!
[06:26:15] <ender456> xec still wont work
[06:27:24] <ender456> all of the links i am trying to go to are hastags
[06:27:34] <ender456> services.php#consulting
[06:28:13] <Jon47> ender456 did you try "location.hash"
[06:28:20] <ender456> yes thats what im using
[06:28:34] <ender456> do you mean without the "window"?
[06:28:43] <Jon47> most likely that does not matter
[06:28:53] <Jon47> unles you made a var in the local scope with the name "location"
[06:29:02] <ender456> no i didnt :-/
[06:29:05] <Jon47> are you changing the hash as part of a handler a user-initiated event?
[06:29:27] <ender456> not sure what u mean.
[06:29:48] <xec> the code you wrote is just going to execute on page load, once
[06:30:08] <ender456> why is that xec?
[06:30:25] <xec> why would it run more than once
[06:30:46] <ender456> well i thought when i click on the nav bar to go from services.php to services.php#consulting it should execute it again
[06:30:46] <xec> you most likely want to listen to clicks on said link or if that's not possible maybe on scroll
[06:31:09] <xec> well, if you click on a link that points to a hash, you don't refresh the page
[06:31:19] <ender456> yeah, whats the best way to fix that?
[06:31:35] <Jon47> I *feel* like some browsers I've used won't let you just change the location arbitrarily - you need to do so in an event handler for a user-initiated event, or else the browser is convinced that you're just trying to jerk the user around
[06:31:42] <xec> you can't "fix" that - it is the intended behavoir, the entire point behind it
[06:31:51] <xec> behaviour*
[06:32:00] <ender456> is there a hack or script that says, on click refresh page
[06:32:03] <xec> behavior?
[06:32:26] <xec> ender456: you can listen to the click event
[06:32:35] <antares74> hello world
[06:32:39] <xec> ender456: what does your markup look like
[06:32:43] <xec> hello antares74!
[06:32:46] <ender456> thanks xec…where can i go to learn about this listen to click
[06:32:49] <ender456> ill paste the markup
[06:33:07] <BigTuna-> maybe this is more of an ajax question. I'd like to have an autocomplete in my form but only allow the user to pick from the list. Basically a select with an autocomplete. Is there a good way to do this?
[06:33:19] <xec> ?click @ ender456
[06:33:19] <bot-t> ender456, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[06:33:23] <ender456> http://pastie.org/3671708
[06:35:13] <xec> ender456: with that markup you could do something like $('ul a').click(function(){ /* do stuff on click */ });
[06:35:32] <ender456> thanks…what is the code for refresh?
[06:35:38] <xec> what?
[06:35:50] <ender456> wait
[06:35:59] <ender456> maybe i should just put the code i want in that click event
[06:36:04] <ender456> instead of refreshing the whole page
[06:36:11] <xec> :)
[06:36:19] <ender456> its all coming together
[06:37:10] <mikkelb> xec: is there a way to make it load the urls i specify in the html?
[06:37:17] <cntx> is it possible to use the widget factory to create "subwidgets"? like: $.widget("my.plugin"...) and $.widget("my.plugin.sub"...)
[06:37:57] <ajpiano> cntx: what would a "Sub widget" do
[06:38:15] <ajpiano> cntx: you can make widgets that inherit from other widgets
[06:38:58] <ajpiano> $.widget("my.subwidget", $.my.widget, { })
[06:39:43] <cntx> ajpiano: for example: i have a $.widget("my.grid"...) and would like to create a sub widget, for example $.widget("my.grid.row") which will coordinate every event action etc for a specifc row inside the gird
[06:39:44] <cntx> *grid
[06:40:12] <cntx> just to seperate the logic for the "container" and the child
[06:40:19] <ajpiano> i don't think you'd need two separate widgest for that
[06:40:47] <xec> mikkelb: of course, just read the href attribute
[06:40:48] <ajpiano> you would just have the grid that adds that functionality to each row
[06:41:06] <ajpiano> or you could indeed have a separate widget that the grid widget instantiates on each row
[06:41:21] <ajpiano> but the notion of a "subwidget" is unsupported by the widget factory
[06:41:42] <cntx> ajpiano: to bad, ok ;)
[06:42:18] <BaruchHashem> xec where should i put this click function
[06:42:57] <BaruchHashem> i guess it doesnt matter
[06:43:18] <BaruchHashem> it worked xec…thanks alot
[06:43:22] <xec> BaruchHashem: inside a docready eventhandler, or at the bottom of the page
[06:43:26] <xec> yw :)
[06:45:23] <Morkel> i have a problem with coffeescript and jquery the coffee version dont work the js does. https://gist.github.com/2205127

[06:46:34] <mikkelb> wow
[06:46:36] <mikkelb> supercool man!!
[06:48:52] <BaruchHashem> xec sorry to bother you again.  So part of the problem is solved, but due to some complexity in my code im getting a different problem
[06:49:27] <BaruchHashem> it will work one time, but for some reason (which i fixed earlier using document ready in a different problem) im getting weird results afterwards
[06:50:11] <xec> BaruchHashem: is there some ajax involved? or DOM elements being created on the fly?
[06:50:22] <BaruchHashem> i dont think so
[06:50:29] <BaruchHashem> but it feels like there are
[06:50:47] <xec> well, you can try binding with .on() instead, see ?on
[06:50:47] <bot-t> well, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:50:55] <BaruchHashem> k ill look into it
[06:51:35] <xec> basically something like $(document).on("click", "selector", function(){ doStuff(); });
[06:52:18] <BaruchHashem> i feel like im gonna need something conceptually to a document ready inside a document ready
[06:53:23] <Syco54645_work> if i have <span>foo</span>some text. how can i get some text?

[06:59:42] <Xotix1> I'm on test.foo.bar.ch there i open an iframe with xxx.foo.bar.ch within fancybox. Now, if i press a button i need to make a click on something within test.foo.bar.ch. How can i do that? fancybox sais i can use parent.$.fancybox.close() for closing it but this seems not to work probably because of same origin policy.  (guess) but Cors should be enabled actually. hmm
[07:00:17] <Xotix1> Domains, protocols and ports must match. :( So, cors doesn't matter here.
[07:00:27] <xec> Haprog: maybe try #jquery-dev
[07:01:00] <Haprog> xec: ok
[07:01:34] <mo0nykit> Is Firefox not capable of using fadeIn? My SVG elements cannot fadeIn using that jQuery method. Is this a known issue?
[07:03:11] <xec> mo0nykit: afaik .fadeIn() modifies the css opacity, maybe it doesn't work on svg?
[07:04:00] <mo0nykit> xec: perhaps.. It works very well on Chrome
[07:08:24] <BaruchHashem> xec i tried .on and it didnt work… what is happening is that no matter which link i click it is always the first one that is running the script

[07:14:10] <BaruchHashem> even if i click interim it opens up the consulting part
[07:14:44] <BaruchHashem> however it takes me to interim
[07:14:51] <BaruchHashem> so i know the link is working
[07:16:31] <BigTuna-> just to confirm.. best way to do an autocomplete select is to use an autocomplete text field that verifies the entry is valid and return an id (as a hidden field)? that the best approach?
[07:22:07] <jacof> hi guys. how can i just the "POST" in a $.ajax() to "GET" ? I did it but now the data is not being sent

[07:23:44] <crashev> what is equivalent to echo/print in javascript ?
[07:23:49] <Xotix1> How can i call an js function within an iframe from its parent? They are cross domain.
[07:25:29] <nFFF> crashev, the direct equivalent I think is document.write()
[07:25:33] <xec> crashev: you can use .text() or .html() with jquery
[07:25:40] <nFFF> although I don't see it recommended much
[07:26:01] <xec> step away from the document.write() , it's actually hazardous

[08:00:37] <mikkelb> xec: hello again, i put our code up at the same server as the HTML pages its suppose to load, but not much is happening im afraid: http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/
[08:04:19] <xec> mikkelb: try to remove the + " body" part of the .load()
[08:04:24] <xec> mikkelb: see if anything happens
[08:11:06] <Stefunel> I got a JSON object and inside this JSON object I think there is an array. I get it like A.B.C, and if I test with if (A.B.C == Array), it always skips that...firebug shows me a distinct 0, then an object, then 1 and then another object...how could I get the contents of the first object in the "array"?
[08:12:25] <ajpiano> "something == Array" is not a valid test to see if something is an array
[08:12:42] <ajpiano> ?isArray
[08:12:43] <bot-t> jQuery.isArray(obj): Determine whether the argument is an array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isArray/
[08:13:14] <mikkelb> xec: nothing so far http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/
[08:13:21] <ajpiano> Stefunel: you access items in an array by dereferencing it with a number
[08:13:27] <ajpiano> something[0]
[08:14:03] <xec> mikkelb: the ajax seems to be fine, i can see it returning the pages
[08:14:14] <Stefunel> ajpiano thanks! that works, yeah, I know with [0], but == Array was bad and it never entered that part
[08:14:17] <xec> mikkelb: did you try removing the selector part of .load() ?
[08:14:29] <xec> i.e. remove the " body"
[08:17:21] <mikkelb> xec: i think so its now looking like $(this).load(url);
[08:18:37] <xec> mikkelb: http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/javascripts/application.js <-- i still see the body part - and i don't think it's my cache?
[08:19:13] <AdvoWork> if i've got: <select size="1" name="cutter_standard" id="cutter_standard"><option value="0">- - - - - - - - - - -</option> and more options,  how can i automatically set it to be selected? tried $('#cutter_standard option:eq(0)'); but no luck
[08:19:22] <mikkelb> xec: oh right sorry, the upload failed!
[08:19:44] <mikkelb> xec: yeah now it's looking a bit different.. the black background from the external HTML seems to be loading..
[08:21:12] <xec> hehe, yeah you have css in the things you load in, which is selecting the global body {} etc
[08:21:36] <xec> which is why i tried to select <body> only, but didn't seem to take
[08:21:47] <mikkelb> ooh oh cool..
[08:22:10] <xec> if you want the styles etc you might need an <iframe>
[08:22:14] <mikkelb> best to set some sorta z-index on #navigation then? some fixed positioing or something?
[08:22:27] <mikkelb> iframe never messed with that before..
[08:22:50] <xec> if you put the newly loaded page(s) inside iframe(s) you won't have the css issue

And my apologies for using the M word! Many thanks
[08:26:56] <djayb6> hello, does .ajaxSuccess( handler() ) works with .done( callback(ajaxResponse) ) ?
[08:27:10] <wathek> Hi everybody
[08:27:22] <djayb6> because .ajaxSuccess is fired before success callback ( .done() )
[08:27:37] <mikkelb> xec: do you know of any tutorials explaining how to do that?
[08:27:49] <wathek> how would you do to fill a form that is in an iframe with values from a form that is in the local page ?
[08:27:55] <mikkelb> sounds better with iframes yeah because i dont want any conflicts in the future so..
[08:28:49] <xec> mikkelb: i don't know any tutorials,  no - but i can't imagine it's very hard to do, see ?wrap
[08:28:50] <bot-t> mikkelb, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[08:29:58] <mikkelb> cool thanks xec
[08:31:07] <mikkelb> xec: spante en runde med drinks på cafe opera til helgen? :D
[08:32:10] <xec> det hørtes faktisk digg ut
[08:32:44] <mikkelb> hehe nice
[08:32:55] <VioByte> ARG!
[08:34:07] <VioByte> $("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid).delay(3000).fadeOut(300).remove(); the alert shows and fades when .remove() is not present i've also tried .detach() but with any of those two set... the alert will not show.
[08:34:47] <quicksilver> VioByte: remove() is not an animation. It will not be queued.
[08:34:58] <quicksilver> VioByte: put the remove() in the callback of the fadeOut?
[08:35:10] <VioByte> quicksilver: i'll try
[08:35:22] <LordThumper> fris: That worked thanks :)
[08:38:07] <VioByte> quicksilver: $("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid).delay(3000).fadeOut(300,function(){$("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid).remove();});
[08:38:11] <VioByte> quicksilver: that works.
[08:38:27] <VioByte> hmm
[08:38:36] <VioByte> i should pass the alert var
[08:38:39] <VioByte> just in case
[08:38:56] <j5098> hi. i'm reading the jquery plugin turorial on jquery.com (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring)  but i'm wondering where to put private methods. the samples all seem to be public methods
[08:39:29] <VioByte> $("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid).delay(3000).fadeOut(300,function(alertid){$("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid).remove();});
[08:39:31] <VioByte> perfect
[08:42:06] <quicksilver> VioByte: using 'this' would be simpler.
[08:42:18] <VioByte> yes it would be
[08:42:28] <VioByte> but $(this) refs to another div
[08:42:35] <VioByte> thats calling this
[08:42:44] <VioByte> thats calling the code above
[08:43:03] <quicksilver> inside the callback, $(this) should be the element the callback runs on
[08:43:05] <quicksilver> I thought
[08:43:17] <VioByte> yea it is
[08:43:30] <VioByte> but the alert is showen when you hit a refresh button
[08:43:39] <VioByte> the refresh div = $(this)
[08:43:45] <VioByte> the alert is not part of it
[08:43:51] <VioByte> just called by it
[08:44:05] <quicksilver> inside the callback to fadeout, (this) will be just the alert box.
[08:44:21] <quicksilver> inside the callback to fadeout, $(this) will be $("#jalert_box_cont_"+alertid)
[08:44:24] <quicksilver> just easier to type.
[08:44:30] <VioByte> hmm
[08:44:39] <VioByte> ok, if it works i'll stick with it
[08:44:50] <AndreLima> yup quick is right
[08:45:45] <VioByte> quicksilver, ok my bad. it works.
[08:46:15] <VioByte> atleast its one less selecter to use
[08:48:00] <VioByte> after jumping into a project not really knowing jquery or javascript.... this porject has showen me alot about jquery and JS, i'm happy with it.
[08:48:17] <VioByte> since i use to always have php do all the hard work.
[08:51:58] <andrew9183> jstree has to be one of the most advanced things ive used
[08:53:00] <nanoc> hi everybody, I just discovered that .live() is deprecated so I'm trying to substitute them in my code for proper .on(), however the .on()'s are not rebinding again, they just work only once. Am I missing something? Aren't .on() suppossed to work like .live() on the surface?
[08:54:11] <andrew9183> have you tried delegate
[08:54:23] <rarneson> nanoc: take a look at this blog post by Andi Smith http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[08:59:07] <nanoc> andrew9183: I thought .delegate() it's also obsoleted by .on(), at least that's what this says: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:01:53] <nanoc> rarneson: I read that one about half an hour ago, my question aims to know if it's correct to assume .on() is a drop in replacement for .live() or if there's something else I should add to my code
[09:02:44] <nanoc> maybe I didn't explain myself correctly, my .on()'s are working, the problem I have is they aren't working *again*, and *again*, and *again*, like the .live()'s did
[09:03:32] <quicksilver> nanoc: .on is absolutely not a drop-in replacement for live.
[09:03:36] <quicksilver> nanoc: did you read the docs for on?
[09:04:28] <AbstractAce_> var imgheight = $("#status_img_lightbox_"+statusid).attr("height");
[09:04:28] <AbstractAce_> im trying to grab the height attribute of <img id=''
[09:04:29] <nanoc> I'm filling an <td> with a <select> brought from DB, after .live('change') I put the <td> back in with the new selected stuff, with the .live()'s I can repeat this over and over, once I replaced .live()'s with .on()'s it just works the first time, I mean just once
[09:04:32] <quicksilver> in fact, the recent veresion of live's docs explain a bbit about on too.
[09:04:37] <quicksilver> nanoc: yes. you cannot do that.
[09:04:42] <quicksilver> nanoc: .on is absolutely not a drop-in replacement for live.
[09:04:46] <quicksilver> nanoc: you use it differently.
[09:04:52] <culh> I'm wondering if I can incorporate google maps into a website, using my own form. google has this, but only with their form.
[09:04:58] <AbstractAce_> it returns undefined, am i doing something wrong
[09:05:03] <jaubourg> nanoc: $( selector, parentSelector ).live( "click", fn ) <=> $( parentSelector ).on( "click", selector, fn )
[09:05:23] <jaubourg> so, if you had just $( selector ).live( "click", fn )
[09:05:39] <jaubourg> it would become $( "body" ).on( "click", selector, fn )
[09:06:02] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery Bowling Night in NoVa! Join us for a night of fun! http://t.co/dZqExdHN ★ http://bit.ly/H7r1Kb
[09:07:08] <Whirl3d> culh, yes you can. It's all in the new google maps API
[09:07:22] <nanoc> jaubourg: I had this: $('td > div > select[name*=fk_emp_id_responsable_cliente_]').live('change', function() {
[09:07:26] <AbstractAce_> socialhapy, TROLOLO
[09:07:29] <nanoc> jaubourg: got replaced with this: $('table').on('change', 'select', function() {
[09:08:57] <AbstractAce_> Whirl3d, hola ;-)
[09:09:27] <phil-adept> Does anyone have any experience with uploadify?
[09:09:40] <jaubourg> nanoc: should work, as long as you don't re-create the table
[09:09:59] <jaubourg> nanoc: key is to have initial selector always staying in the doc
[09:10:02] <Whirl3d> howdy!
[09:11:40] <AbstractAce_> whazzup man
[09:13:16] <Whirl3d> So I have a bunch of "colors" referenced in a table in excel like: 0x33aa22, for jquery color fields, Ishould convert them to #33aa22,. Is this correct or is there some other little thing about the differnt number formats?
[09:13:45] <AbstractAce_> i believe hex code is always the same Whirl3d
[09:14:34] <Anphonic> ^^
[09:14:39] <Whirl3d> well these folks have an odd choice in colors then. Blech
[09:14:44] <AbstractAce_> how can i change the height attributes value of a <img src=...
[09:14:57] <AbstractAce_> i tried $("#status_img_lightbox_"+statusid).attr("height").val(newheight);
[09:15:10] <andrew9183> hey guys, i have a delete button that calls a delete function in a different plugin, and i wish to prepend this with a confirm dialog.  instead of the usual declaring a deleteflag and setting it to true/false for yes/no respectively, is there a better way to do it ?
[09:15:11] <Anphonic> attr('height','60');
[09:15:27] <AbstractAce_> ok
[09:15:55] <Anphonic> dont think you need px, but cant remember 100%
[09:16:09] <nanoc> jaubourg: "initial selector" -> that's the key, thanks.
[09:16:16] <jholloman> you dont need px
[09:16:45] <Anphonic> http://www.oklahomawelcome.com/phptest/  why is $getInfo returning the function?
[09:17:06] <Anphonic> sorry its not in a fiddle but its a simple page
[09:24:03] <culh> Whirl3d: I'm not talking about this ==> http://maps.google.com/help/maps/getmaps/additional-options.html
[09:24:15] <culh> that's with their form. I need to do it with my own
[09:26:46] <Anphonic> can you return success from an ajax call to a variable?
[09:27:09] <Anphonic> rather, how can you
[09:27:42] <Whirl3d> culh, that's not what I use
[09:28:24] <Whirl3d> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
[09:29:08] <culh> aha, nice
[09:29:43] <px12> i'm trying to do something like this.. 		$('.event-bl').hover(function () { $(this > ".event-bg").hide(); what would be the correct selector in place of (this > ".event-bg") ?
[09:30:08] <Anphonic> thats what im working on, trying to get a custom overlay from a dynamic script
[09:30:31] <px12> whaa?
[09:30:57] <Anphonic> px12: sorry, in reply to culh
[09:31:28] <j5098> i'm reading the jquery plugin turorial on jquery.com (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring)  but i'm wondering where to put private methods. the samples all seem to be public methods
[09:31:31] <culh> Anphonic: The instructions looks good and simple to follow.
[09:31:36] <px12> or is $(this).each(".event-bg") is my only choice? i mean.. i only have one event-bg in every event-bl
[09:32:22] <Anphonic> culh: Its not bad but im learning this all on the fly and high speed pace while dealing with everything else lol
[09:32:36] <Nomikos> px12: you want to hide a sub-element when hovering over an element?
[09:33:07] <culh> Anphonic: right, so am I. I've to deliver this massive website tonight.
[09:33:15] <px12> Nomikos:i wrote hide just like that :P i will be setting a css rule on hover. :P
[09:33:33] <culh> time to make an expresso d*_*b
[09:33:35] <Nomikos> $('.parent').on('hover', function() {$(this).find('.child').addClass('foo')}); maybe
[09:33:53] <Anphonic> culh: makes it more fun. This is for a major site too, weather maps using wunderground and gmaps
[09:33:57] <px12> thanks :)
[09:34:21] <Nomikos> or shorter maybe $('.parent').on('hover', function() {$('.child', this).addClass('foo')}); maybe
[09:34:33] <Nomikos> .. ^W
[09:35:05] <Anphonic> for some reason, var $getInfo = setInformation(); is setting the value of $getInfo to the whole function
[09:35:39] <Anphonic> err was, now a nice undefined :P
[09:36:03] <px12> Nomikos:sorry, now another question :P what would i do to select a 'blockquote' element just below that 'this' element?
[09:36:26] <Nomikos> px12: $('blockquote', this)  ?
[09:36:47] <Nomikos> px12: the optional second argument of the selector acts as context, speeds things up sometimes
[09:36:50] <px12> no no.. blockquote is not a child of 'this'. its just after this.
[09:37:01] <quicksilver> $(this).next('blockquote')
[09:37:03] <Anphonic> .next
[09:37:07] <Nomikos> oh after, hm. .nextAll('blockquote')
[09:37:25] <quicksilver> Nomikos: http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/ - useful stuff.
[09:37:29] <Nomikos> .. or that. I can never remember the difference between the nexts
[09:37:45] <quicksilver> hmm that was for px12 really :)
[09:37:46] <px12> quicksilver:thanks :)
[09:38:03] <Nomikos> quicksilver: a reminder can't hurt in my case :-p though it won't stick at this moment
[09:39:48] <culh> Anphonic: nice... We're doing something very similar. I'm also using underground for weather, maps for directions, multi-language support with lacale prediction based on IP range, courossel for navigating images, ajax for form submitions, plus I had to build a CMS from scratch - the one I was using didn't have support so I decided to make my own - which delayed the project around a mouth and
[09:39:49] <px12> another one, :P how to find out if $(this).next('blockquote') is hidden or visible? (its a tree navigation)
[09:39:49] <culh> a half and the client is crawling up my ass.
[09:40:39] <culh> Anphonic: oh, and there's also a search tool for hotel reservations that uses (yet) another remote API
[09:41:09] <px12> quicksilver and Nomikos? :P any ideas on that question? :P
[09:41:16] <quicksilver> .is(':visible')
[09:41:18] <culh> plus I'm getting paied about a third of what I should have been
[09:41:19] <Nomikos> px12: try adding the jQuery pseudo-selector ':visible' to the blockquote
[09:41:22] <culh> :/
[09:41:25] <Nomikos> or that
[09:41:52] <px12> umm.. wait.. so.. .is(':visible') will return true if it is visible?
[09:41:55] <Anphonic> culh: ouch, i know that feeling. this project was due jan 1st... now hoping it doesnt turn into an april fools joke since thats the new date
[09:41:55] <Nomikos> 'blockquote:visible' might work, saves you like, bytes of bandwidth
[09:42:34] <Nomikos> yeah, the is() returns boolean, the selector thing filters, AFAIK
[09:42:45] <px12> thanks :)
[09:43:34] <Anphonic> culh: i'm going lat/lng based maps from wunderground. that part is cake. the b is being intergrating it into the gmap overlay
[09:45:38] <culh> the b?
[09:45:45] <culh> ah ic
[09:45:49] <Anphonic> ;) lol
[09:46:12] <culh> good luck
[09:46:19] <Anphonic> you too
[09:47:14] <djayb6> is .ajaxSuccess() envent a "global" alternative to the "local" success callback
[09:47:33] <djayb6> or is it meant to be called when the local success callback has finished ?
[09:49:48] <px12> how to select the first blockquote of a parent element?
[09:50:18] <px12> Nomikos and quicksilver to the rescue. :P
[09:50:54] <Nomikos> pseudoselector blockquote:first ?
[09:51:29] <andrew9183> anyone here develop plugins ? i am just continually impressed at some of these pluginss.
[09:51:43] <andrew9183> will i ever get to the stage of developing plugins
[09:51:49] <Nomikos> px12: if I start making typos it's because I'm drinking, so start accepting my answers in context :p
[09:52:08] <Nomikos> *that context
[09:52:08] <px12> so.. if the parent element is 'this' then the first blockquote inside 'this' would be selected by $('blockquote:first', this) right?
[09:52:17] <px12> hahahaha, that's cool :) :P
[09:52:44] <Nomikos> px12: you can find the answer quickest by trying it out in jsfiddle
[09:52:54] <Briareos1> why would this http://pastie.org/3672782 not cause an alert() when clicking on ANY anchor on the page?
[09:52:55] <Nomikos> because I would do that same and it'd take me longer at this moment :-)
[09:53:00] <px12> hehe
[09:53:22] <Nomikos> Briareos1: add a '$' at the start?
[09:54:14] <smallcapsdude> What Nomikos said.
[09:54:22] <djayb6> is .ajaxSuccess() envent a "global" alternative to the "local" success callback or is it meant to be called when the local success callback has finished ?
[09:54:28] <smallcapsdude> what nomikos said.
[09:54:30] <Nomikos> and then it might even work without the call() thing
[09:54:33] <Nomikos> whatever that does
[09:54:49] <px12> Nomikos: that worked perfectly :) now i'm gonna have dinner :P
[09:54:49] <px12> bye
[09:54:57] <Nomikos> o/
[09:55:08] <Nomikos> (that's a waving person, not the Hitler salute)
[09:55:27] <superdmp> can you recommend a lightbox? I've been using fancyBox, which is lovely, but it misuses the rel attribute and I want one that doesn't
[09:55:33] <djayb6> Nomikos thanks for this precision
[09:55:34] <djayb6> ;)
[09:55:48] <Nomikos> djayb6: you're welcome! I have no idea :-p
[09:56:29] <djayb6> dammmit ! ajax events will kill me
[09:56:36] <djayb6> goodbye, mankind
[09:56:44] <Nomikos> djayb6: stick to the shortcuts?
[09:56:52] <Nomikos> or are you doing something horribly complicated?
[09:56:54] <Briareos1> Nomikos: is that a guess or a suggestion? :)
[09:57:21] <Nomikos> Briareos1: the $ thing? both, actually, but I tested it and it made it work
[09:58:30] <Nomikos> Briareos1: http://jsfiddle.net/N9Zp7/
[09:59:01] <Nomikos> nyaaargh, except you can't see the there-or-not '$', rest assured it's /there/.
[09:59:33] <djayb6> Nomikos i want to call a routine function after a successful ajax call, but I have over 9000 ajax calls, so i won't repeat the routine function in each local success callback
[09:59:52] <Nomikos> OVER 9000??
[10:00:01] <alexr2> o.O
[10:00:04] <Nomikos> That is Anime worthy!
[10:00:08] <djayb6> lmao
[10:00:30] <djayb6> well, not so many, but still a lot ;)
[10:00:33] <Briareos1> Nomikos: thank you. hero of the day (: that was actually generated from my coffeescript )
[10:00:45] <djayb6> and i read about .ajaxSuccess event
[10:00:57] <djayb6> which I thought was perfect for what I need
[10:01:18] <djayb6> but .ajaxSuccess is called BEFORE the local success callback is executed
[10:01:29] <Nomikos> Briareos1: \o/ I've seen that $ disappear in editor snippets, where you had to escape it with a \. maybe that applies?
[10:02:29] <Briareos1> Nomikos: your suggestion was right. i just had to write this in the first line of the coffeescript: $ ->
[10:02:43] <Nomikos> djayb6: is it at all possible to do the calls in a batch - or is this a lengthy process where you want to give some incremental feedback?
[10:03:11] <Nomikos> Briareos1: ah ok. I should learn CS one day, it sounds cool
[10:03:24] <Briareos1> Nomikos: usually it is :)
[10:03:34] <Nomikos> heh
[10:03:44] <ioscale> also i created a dazzler channel there :)
[10:03:51] <Briareos1> allows me to forget terminating lines with semicolons at least hehe
[10:04:50] <Nomikos> Is someone merging coffeescript and python yet? that'd be a nice next step
[10:05:42] <djayb6> actually, afert inserting AJAX  html response, I want to check if a certain class exists, if yes I display some buttons. I could do the check in each local success callback, but it sounds a bad way of coding
[10:06:28] <djayb6> and if I want to add more routines, it's a pain to add/improve code
[10:06:31] <djayb6> how would you do ?
[10:07:23] <ajpiano> djayb6: you can attach callbacks to the return value of $.ajax (and friends)
[10:07:37] <ajpiano> var foo = $.ajax(opts);   foo.success(bar);
[10:07:59] <ajpiano> or like, function requestWrapper(opts) { return $.ajax(opts); }    requestWrapper(opts).success(fn)
[10:08:54] <djayb6> ah yeah, i'm gonna try that, thanks
[10:11:33] <kingfisher64> hello, i'm looking for a scrollbar plugin that replaces the main browser window. I've found one @ http://greengeckodesign.com/projects/MooScroll/examples/example2/index.htm using mootools. Is anyone aware of a plugin that provides this functionality using jQuery? Thanks
[10:13:17] <Anphonic> how can I use new Image() to just assign the image to a variable
[10:14:39] <shmup> http://pastie.org/3672905
[10:14:43] <shmup> any thoughts on why that wouldn't work?
[10:16:51] <shmup> nvmm got it
[10:16:53] <nail_> shmup: $(this).val(), not this.val()
[10:17:08] <AbstractAce> can someone tell me why var newheight = imgheight + 20;
[10:17:14] <AbstractAce> where imgheight = 500
[10:17:17] <jacof> plz http://pastebin.com/vPitkhQM, I'm getting no response from the second $j.ajax() ... why???
[10:17:20] <shmup> yeah we just figured it out hah
[10:17:21] <shmup> thanks though nail_
[10:17:25] <AbstractAce> 580*
[10:17:32] <AbstractAce> returns 58020
[10:18:34] <shmup> lets see the pastie AbstractAce
[10:19:16] <nail_> AbstractAce: cause it's "580" and not 580, so use parseInt(imgheight) + 20
[10:19:30] <nail_> or imgheight*1 + 20
[10:20:59] <jacof> i've checked img and returns a string as wanted
[10:21:20] <jacof> both img and json_upload_location are correct
[10:21:42] <jacof> but .ajax() is just not doing anything.
[10:23:01] <jacof> pls
[10:27:38] <johnkpaul> jacof: I think you have a misunderstanding of how jquery.Deferred works
[10:28:12] <johnkpaul> the callbacks that you add using.done()  and .fail() don't return something to the defining scope, they are regular callbacks like you would use with jquery's success and error proeprties
[10:28:53] <tesmar> is there any way to get access to the response data in the global ajax success handler in query 1.7.1?
[10:28:54] <johnkpaul> it doesn't make sense to return anything from the .done() and .fail() methods because their return values are discarded AFAIK
[10:29:23] <johnkpaul> tesmar: the second parameter is the xhr object
[10:29:40] <johnkpaul> so xhr.responseText
[10:29:48] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxSuccess @tesmar
[10:29:48] <bot-t> tesmar, .ajaxSuccess(handler): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[10:30:33] <tesmar> johnkpaul: thx
[10:30:46] <tesmar> I guess I'll  have to parse it into JSON, but that's alright
[10:30:47] <johnkpaul> no problem
[10:31:24] <johnkpaul> tesmar: check what else is in the xxhr object
[10:31:32] <johnkpaul> I wouldn't be surprised if it was already there, I jsut don't know the name
[10:31:47] <tesmar> readyState
[10:31:49] <tesmar> statusText
[10:31:52] <jacof> johnkpaul so you're suggesting to just set a variable if those events occur and then return that ?
[10:31:53] <tesmar> status
[10:32:09] <johnkpaul> worst case tesmar,
[10:32:11] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON
[10:32:12] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:32:34] <johnkpaul> jacof: no, I'm saying that those functions run asynchronously, and they can't reurn somthing to the defining scope
[10:33:02] <johnkpaul> so by the time the .done() and .fail() callbacks happen, the function where they're defined has already completed runing
[10:33:08] <johnkpaul> and in your code, "nothing happened" is returned
[10:33:21] <jacof> johnkpaul Ah! so I sould return something like: return false; but, an alert(); for example, in the .done and .fail
[10:33:22] <jacof> ?
[10:33:59] <johnkpaul> hm, that's hard for me to tell, I don't know what you're code is trying to do
[10:34:19] <jacof> johnkpaul, no, for example. I mean not to try to "return" something, but keep the code running after that function .
[10:34:20] <johnkpaul> if you want to use the promise system, perhaps you could use it all the way through, including what you return
[10:34:35] <johnkpaul> well the code will run again after the ajax call returns
[10:34:41] <johnkpaul> perhaps look into .pipe
[10:34:42] <johnkpaul> ?pipe
[10:34:43] <bot-t> deferred.pipe([doneFilter], [failFilter]): [New in v1.6] Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[10:36:21] <johnkpaul> jacof: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2255-Using-jQuery-s-Pipe-Method-To-Change-Deferred-Resolution.htm
[10:36:52] <AbstractAce> nail_, but it worked without parseInt for decrementing
[10:41:35] <jacof> johnkpaul ok but how do I make my javascript *wait* until it gets a response from that functio n?
[10:41:52] <johnkpaul> you can't, you need to structure your code differently
[10:42:37] <jacof> at this moment, I'm facing the problem that I'm getting: image 1/3 ready.. image 3/3 ready... image 2/3 readu...
[10:42:48] <jacof> basically because they get at different points in time I assume
[10:43:20] <johnkpaul> so you need them in that order, is that what you mean?
[10:43:24] <hattorihanzo> anyone know where jQTouch ppl hang?
[10:44:01] <jacof> johnkpaul yes, i want them to load in a specific order. So i'll need that the FOR loop basically waits until the AJAX request in get_image is done, to continue
[10:45:04] <johnkpaul> if you want to force that to happen, you need to start the ajax calls inside of the callbacks, three deep
[10:45:10] <johnkpaul> or you need to wrangle promises a little bit
[10:45:50] <jacof> sorry what are the callbacks ?
[10:46:49] <jacof> johnkpaul I also need to execute a function once All of the images have been downloaded, so I'll definitely need to wait somehow
[10:48:01] <jonkristian> I am working on a menu on mobile devices that when you tap it the ul should come visible, do i need jquery mobile for this?
[10:48:12] <johnkpaul> jacof: so there are two options, learn how to work with jquery's ajax callbacks or learn how to work with jquery promises
[10:48:30] <johnkpaul> jonkristian: for that one requirepement specifically? no, you don't need jquery mobile
[10:48:38] <jacof> johnkpaul which one do you suggest
[10:48:48] <jonkristian> johnkpaul: doesn't seem to work with click, is there another event i should use?
[10:49:21] <johnkpaul> jonkristian: the event on a mobile device isn't called click
[10:49:24] <johnkpaul> it's touch or something
[10:49:34] <johnkpaul> I dont' remember of the top of my head, google for the tap event names
[10:49:49] <johnkpaul> jacof: depends on your background, it seems like in your code, you chose the promise method
[10:49:49] <jonkristian> yeah i think i tried that, i'll give it another shot
[10:50:15] <johnkpaul> jonkristian: I hear that there's a ##mobileweb now
[10:50:17] <jonkristian> but those touch events are included in main jquery right, not the mobile one?
[10:50:22] <jonkristian> johnkpaul: ah thanks
[10:50:49] <johnkpaul> jonkristian: jquery doesn't care about the name of the events that you use, they just don't give you the convience functions
[10:50:55] <jacof> johnkpaul but what if I use async:false ??
[10:51:01] <johnkpaul> .bind("whateveryouwant") and .trigger("whateveryouwant") will work fine jonkristian
[10:51:06] <jonkristian> ok
[10:51:32] <johnkpaul> jacof: that has some very bad side effects for the user
[10:51:45] <johnkpaul> the UI will be compeletely frozen until the ajax call returns
[10:52:01] <johnkpaul> but yes, that would work
[10:52:14] <jacof> johnkpaul well.. i'm the only user
[10:54:36] <johnkpaul> jacof: then that works fine, I would really recommend it for any production code
[10:55:32] <johnkpaul> recommend _against_ it
[10:55:33] <johnkpaul> ha
[10:56:21] <jacof> mm ok i'll look into promises() as well
[10:56:59] <jacof> how do I write this in Javascript: If thisItems.key is one of the elements in ThisArray, then, do this.
[10:57:25] <jacof> sorry wrong channel
[10:57:33] <monk12> anyone using the Foundation CSS framework?
[10:58:25] <monk12> Im trying to figure out if some jquery/adaptive type switching is going on: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/forms.php  when you resize the browser window smaller, it thinks its a phone kinda and the inputs stretch to 100% of window...
[10:58:53] <monk12> but i think the rule that does that, only is when the input has a class of .oversize or .small, which in Firebug looks like doesnt
[10:59:47] <min|dvir|us-work> Hi. Is it safe to change an a tag's href from within .click()?
[10:59:55] <monk12> so not sure how that rule is coming into play heh. maybe this is more a CSS question. but i just assume some javascript switching is going on where it sets a class somewhere/somehow like body.small-browser-window pretend.
[11:00:33] <johnkpaul> min|dvir|us-work: what do you mean "safe", it's definitely possible
[11:01:09] <mllie> If I have 2 radio buttons with name type[1], type[2], type[3] etc and want to hook into the change event for every of these couples.. How do I do?
[11:01:14] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, will the browser be directed to the new href?
[11:01:17] <min|dvir|us-work> (Reliably?)
[11:01:51] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean if you change it in the click on the anchor tag, will it use the new href?
[11:01:55] <johnkpaul> I don't know, check it in a jsfiddle
[11:01:59] <johnkpaul> or, you could window.location = href
[11:02:40] <min|dvir|us-work> Does anyone know if changing an anchor's href within a click tag will reliably cause the browser go to the new href?
[11:03:09] <johnkpaul> min|dvir|us-work: you can check this yourself in 5 minutes
[11:03:40] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, by testing it across all 12 major browsers?
[11:03:41] <min|dvir|us-work> On platforms I don't have?
[11:04:15] <johnkpaul> I mean, at least get a positive result once
[11:04:46] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, I've tested in Chromium and Firefox.
[11:05:02] <granden> I got a bit of problem using jquery/php to create a new row in a table. my php file looks like this, http://pastebin.com/sKzXyc7W and my html file with the jquery code looks like this, http://pastebin.com/jdEFaiyx
[11:05:03] <johnkpaul> oh ok, so it works there?
[11:05:07] <granden> anyone who can spot the problem?
[11:06:00] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, yes, but that doesn't mean anything at all.
[11:06:23] <min|dvir|us-work> I can't believe people still use PHP.
[11:06:43] <johnkpaul> :) but it makes people $
[11:06:46] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, are you aware HTML5 is the new XHTML 1.0 Strict?
[11:06:47] <mllie> If I have 2 radio buttons with name type[1], type[2], type[3] etc and want to hook into the change event for every of these couples.. How do I do?
[11:07:36] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, why are you creating an AJAX call?
[11:07:37] <min|dvir|us-work> Just submit the form.
[11:07:59] <min|dvir|us-work> Do preprocessing logic in the $('form').submit() event handler.
[11:08:42] <Innocentus> hi
[11:08:46] <johnkpaul> min|dvir|us-work: yeah, that's true, you do need to test in every browser, what others do you have access to?
[11:08:54] <johnkpaul> ie gives all of their old IEs as virutalpc images
[11:09:01] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, no, that's not what I need to do.
[11:09:26] <min|dvir|us-work> What I need to do is see affirmative results in the documentation, or hear it directly from a dev.
[11:09:28] <min|dvir|us-work> Or have someone show me where to look in the source.
[11:09:40] <johnkpaul> in the source for what?
[11:09:48] <min|dvir|us-work> jQuery...?
[11:09:54] <johnkpaul> you want to the source for .click?
[11:10:08] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.click
[11:10:12] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, probably not, since I'm pretty sure it's a thin wrapper.
[11:10:32] <nail_> AbstractAce: that's because + is the concatenation and addition operator and it will act depending on the context (in this case "580" is a string), '-' is only for arithmetic operations so it automatically converts its operands
[11:10:37] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: What's the concern?
[11:11:13] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, I want to know if changing an anchor's href in a click handler will reliably cause the browser to go to the new href onclick.
[11:11:38] <Innocentus> QUESTION: On the plugin tutorial page http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring chapter namespacing is described how to namespace plugins with multiple methods
[11:12:00] <Innocentus> QUESTION: However, do all used functions need to namespaced?
[11:12:15] <Innocentus> QUESTION: Or only the function which should be publicly available
[11:12:28] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: Pretty sure the answer to that is browser-level, not jQuery level
[11:12:29] <granden> min|dvir|us-work: But this way I would not have to change to another page, and as well this is the way I learned when I started learning jquery.
[11:12:47] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, POST the form into an iframe.
[11:12:51] <Innocentus> QUESTION: anyone?
[11:13:20] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, and what you learn at first is usually not the best way. (Quite obviously, in my opinion.)
[11:13:50] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, that's a shame.
[11:13:58] <granden> min|dvir|us-work: I guess we differ here, because the iframe solution is not a nice way to do it, in my opinion.
[11:14:14] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, but it requires the least amount of duplicated code.
[11:14:25] <min|dvir|us-work> Which is of greatest concern, in my opinion. :)
[11:14:36] <AbstractAce> nail_, ok
[11:14:43] <min|dvir|us-work> granden, furthermore your JS-less users wouldn't deal with a refresh.
[11:15:00] <granden> JS-less ?

[11:16:22] <Nomikos> drive-by tweeting, I hope this doesn't catch on
[11:16:41] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: Is there a reason you're not setting window.location or scrolling the page if the link is a #
[11:16:51] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, no.
[11:16:56] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, asking to learn.
[11:17:34] <Eviltwin> Especially if you're currently changing the href after it's clicked to make it go to the real target you want
[11:17:46] <Eviltwin> Just explicitly set window.location instead
[11:17:49] <Eviltwin> That always works
[11:18:36] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, definitely. I guess I just like the elegance of having it do what it does, but just changing the href.
[11:19:00] <min|dvir|us-work> Rather than event.preventDefault(); otherStuff();.
[11:20:04] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: I wouldn't call it elegant to try to change the link target mid-bubble so that it goes to place you want
[11:21:00] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, I don't know why I'm doing it this way.
[11:21:07] <min|dvir|us-work> I'm stupid for not doing it onready.
[11:21:13] <ravenzz> so is it still better to use data() if the value is a string?
[11:21:26] <min|dvir|us-work> Oh, nevermind.
[11:21:29] <min|dvir|us-work> I had a good reason. :)
[11:21:55] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, that gives very little information. Why are you storing the value in the first place?
[11:22:12] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, the answer to that question will answer whether you should use .data().
[11:22:32] <LordThumper> Is there any way to stop a jQuery UI draggable from being dragged out of viewport?
[11:22:50] <LordThumper> (generating scrollbars in the progress)
[11:23:00] <Innocentus> QUESTION: I got an element of a javascript array. How can I find out the index of that element by only the element-reference alone? :)
[11:23:06] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: Did you look over the settings for it?
[11:23:18] <Eviltwin> There are some settings for restricting movement
[11:23:27] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: You cannot
[11:23:30] <Eviltwin> It's not possible
[11:23:36] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Yes I am looking at the documentation atm
[11:23:43] <Innocentus> damn
[11:23:55] <min|dvir|us-work> Innocentus, .index(element).
[11:23:58] <Innocentus> wow
[11:24:04] <LordThumper> Ah found "containment"
[11:24:11] <min|dvir|us-work> Wait, that's Python.
[11:24:26] <johnkpaul> .index is always confusing to me, I always have to look it up
[11:24:27] <johnkpaul> ?index
[11:24:28] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/

[11:24:52] <min|dvir|us-work> johnkpaul, a JS array is not a jQuery object.
[11:25:05] <min|dvir|us-work> (But a jQuery object is a JS array.)
[11:25:11] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: This will work if you want to finx the index of an element in a specified array: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/

[11:25:20] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: He did say JavaScript array
[11:25:26] <johnkpaul> it's just an object with int indexes
[11:25:28] <johnkpaul> int keys rather

[11:26:33] <ravenzz> min|dvir|us-work I am not storing that value, I need to get it
[11:27:18] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, how is the value there in the first place, then?
[11:27:30] <min|dvir|us-work> If it's there in the first place without you storing it, obviously you should use .data().
[11:27:59] <ravenzz> I have these bunch of divs with a data attribute
[11:28:00] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, eh, I'd rather go with the native solution when it's just as cross-platform and easy.
[11:28:11] <ravenzz> <div data-foo="value"></diV<
[11:28:16] <ravenzz> v>
[11:28:16] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us-work: For what?
[11:28:25] <tgodar> annoyed pressing enter on my dialog's form refreshes the whole page... reading a bit it seems like only if one input?
[11:28:38] <min|dvir|us-work> Eviltwin, array.indexOf(element) v. $.inArray(array, element).
[11:28:44] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: .data("foo")
[11:29:17] <min|dvir|us-work> tgodar, pressing Enter within a form SHOULD submit the form.
[11:29:27] <min|dvir|us-work> (Unless it's a textarea.)
[11:29:53] <tgodar> min|dvir|us-work: not exactly my issue.  see: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6967#comment:3
[11:29:58] <ravenzz> Eviltwin I know that.
[11:30:15] <ravenzz> "Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null) otherwise it is left as a string. To retrieve the value's attribute as a string without any attempt to convert it, use the attr()"
[11:30:17] <kingfisher64> anybody know what jquery is used to create the custom scrollbar on: http://www.ascensionlatorre.com/
[11:30:43] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, why do you need it?
[11:30:50] <ravenzz> that is where my question come frome
[11:31:33] <min|dvir|us-work> tgodar, is the problem that you're event.preventDefaulting when enter is pressed on an input?
[11:31:57] <ravenzz> min|dvir|us-work i have these elements IDs stored as data-elem-id. I need to collect them
[11:32:06] <ravenzz> but I have experienced a weird issue
[11:32:10] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, just use .data().
[11:32:23] <ravenzz> if I use data it get the wrong ones :|
[11:32:39] <tgodar> min|dvir|us-work	: mostly griping.  To prevent page refreshing I am using preventDefualt at the window level.  Meaning I need to handle enter indiv. on the given inputs.
[11:32:40] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, sounds like you're doing something wrong. Make a minimal test case on jsfiddle.
[11:32:45] <ravenzz> I mean I don't even know where those comes from
[11:32:57] <min|dvir|us-work> tgodar, you most likely then want to use .keydown().
[11:33:07] <min|dvir|us-work> Because .keypress() happens after .keydown().
[11:33:20] <tgodar> kk, just seemed goofy the behavior changed with one input vs, more than one
[11:33:34] <ravenzz> min|dvir|us-work actually it is almost impossible, but I could show you some private code, so you can see it in action
[11:34:10] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, let me know when there's a minimal JSfiddle test case.
[11:34:21] <ravenzz> man it is impossible
[11:34:33] <min|dvir|us-work> Or some other minimal test case.
[11:34:39] <ravenzz> it is a bookmarklet and I am working on a 3rd party website
[11:34:43] <ravenzz> hold on
[11:34:52] <ravenzz> do you have a twitter account?
[11:35:00] <min|dvir|us-work> Don't worry about it. :)
[11:35:07] <ravenzz> you need it.
[11:36:07] <ravenzz> so?
[11:39:39] <ravenzz> min|dvir|us-work https://twitter.com/#!/search/jesus
[11:39:57] <ravenzz> then open your console and issue these 2 commands
[11:40:02] <ravenzz> console.debug(jQuery('.tweet:first')); jQuery('.tweet:first').data('tweet-id');
[11:41:02] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, aha.
[11:41:11] <ravenzz> you see that?
[11:41:23] <ravenzz> jQuery('.tweet:first').attr('data-tweet-id');
[11:41:25] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, jQuery's .data() attribute actually does not update the HTML data-* attributes.
[11:41:25] <ravenzz> work just fine
[11:41:36] <min|dvir|us-work> So it depends on what you want.
[11:41:50] <min|dvir|us-work> I don't know the difference between the tweet-id in the HTML and the tweet-id in the JS.
[11:41:55] <min|dvir|us-work> But that's what's up.
[11:42:01] <ravenzz> yep
[11:42:21] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, also, .data('tweetId') is usually what people write.
[11:42:26] <ravenzz> maybe it is somewhat alterated by the twitter app
[11:42:37] <min|dvir|us-work> ravenzz, yes, like I said.
[11:42:47] <ravenzz> same thing
[11:43:10] <ravenzz> ok i'd go for the attr() solution
[11:45:02] <Guest12260> v
[11:45:34] <techouse> is .delegate the same as .on?
[11:45:45] <Guest12260> v
[11:46:07] <StevenCodes22> Ugh
[11:46:18] <StevenCodes22> Hows the day been for ya techouse ?
[11:46:53] <techouse> StevenCodes22: sunny
[11:46:54] <techouse> :)
[11:46:55] <Eviltwin> techouse: .on didn't exist before 1.7 but .delegate has existed since like 1.4.6 or something
[11:47:07] <techouse> well, yea, but the function remains the same
[11:47:12] <techouse> since i'm using 1.7
[11:47:27] <Eviltwin> Now .delegate simply calls .on with the arguments slightly reordered
[11:47:28] <StevenCodes22> Good to hear :) same here
[11:47:34] <StevenCodes22> bit of a breeze
[11:48:39] <techouse> have to work like crazzeeee :/
[11:48:58] <StevenCodes22> techouse,  What do you do ?
[11:49:15] <techouse> i'm finishing a webpage
[11:49:27] <Whirl3d> can the .map method remove an element from the source list? In other words, in my iteration function, if I am going to return the element, I don't want it to remain in the array from which it came...
[11:49:29] <StevenCodes22> ah gotcha
[11:49:52] <StevenCodes22> techouse, www.stevencodes.com ;)
[11:50:31] <techouse> WP :)
[11:50:33] <techouse> <3
[11:50:56] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: then you want filter, no?
[11:50:59] <johnkpaul> ?filter
[11:50:59] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:51:28] <Whirl3d> I have the hardest time deciding between map, filter, each,    I am never sure which to use
[11:51:41] <Whirl3d> ?.map
[11:51:41] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: You want to remove an element from the source array?
[11:51:41] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[11:52:42] <StevenCodes22> :)
[11:52:55] <Eviltwin> Not the output?
[11:53:09] <Whirl3d> I have a long list of objects that I am going to build DOM elements from, but I want to grab one element from the list at page load (based on the presence of a hash) to load first.
[11:53:33] <Whirl3d> grab one object from the list, sorry
[11:54:23] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, I tried to use underscore.js, but it was more than I could process right away.
[11:55:38] <Whirl3d> I
[11:56:13] <Whirl3d> i'll probably just do a for loop to grab the object and push it to the top of the array so it loads first
[11:57:35] <xmaddness> Do they not have pop and push methods?
[11:57:42] <WebDragon> I have <section><img/><h2>title</h2><p>some more text</p></section> and I wanted to grab $("img").closest("h2").text(); and save it in a var, but I seem to be DoingItWrong™
[11:57:46] <WebDragon> what am I missing here
[11:58:09] <WebDragon> does closest() not look at siblings? only closest _up_ the dom tree?
[11:58:22] <xmaddness> try find
[11:58:40] <Eviltwin> ?closest @ WebDragon
[11:58:40] <bot-t> WebDragon, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:58:59] <Eviltwin> ?siblings @ WebDragon
[11:59:00] <bot-t> WebDragon, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[12:00:05] <WebDragon> Eviltwin: so I could say $(img.contentphoto).siblings(h2).text() ?
[12:00:39] <WebDragon> schwing!
[12:00:39] <Eviltwin> If you add the very important quotes
[12:00:43] <WebDragon> yes :D
[12:00:51] <WebDragon> I was shorthanding it in here
[12:08:50] <shadi> Hi all. May I ask a question?
[12:10:00] <johnkpaul> ?ask
[12:10:01] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:10:31] <shadi> I have a base64-encoded png image information in a string variable (eg 'a'), I need to change the color of its pixels and then save the new information in 'a'. is it possible?
[12:10:33] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: if it's a regular array, you could use the sort fucntion
[12:10:55] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/AkAvt/6/
[12:11:11] <Whirl3d> just plain ugly
[12:11:48] <johnkpaul> shadi: that's not really a jquery question, I have a feeling it is possible using the canvas api, but you'd get more responses in ##javascript
[12:12:56] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: so if the hash is there, you need to move the hash painting to the beginning fo the list
[12:12:57] <johnkpaul> ?
[12:13:20] <shadi> thanks @johnkpaul, I cannot use canvas. I will also ask my question in jscript channel. thanks.
[12:13:28] <Whirl3d> sure. That means someone came to the site from a bookmark. I want to load their painting right away
[12:13:36] <Whirl3d> then load the others
[12:14:06] <Whirl3d> otherwise, I just load them sequentially
[12:14:34] <johnkpaul> but it seems like there are multiple formats for the hash?
[12:14:58] <Whirl3d> Sure. But I am only concerned abou the formats that I am using.
[12:15:36] <Whirl3d> I don't want to get all fancy with deparameterizing the hash like BBQ,
[12:18:45] <moltar_net1> Hey all! I just ran into a strange issue. When I replace part of the form dynamically, that part of the form is lost during submit. E.g. I have one of those dynamic region/state fields. If you select US/CA - it shows state/province <select>, but if you select any other country, it gets replaced with <input type=text>. I'm seeing the DOM insertion to be correct (via firebug) and I am observing submitted fields via 
[12:19:13] <moltar_net1> Do I need to somehow update form object after html replacement?
[12:20:42] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/AkAvt/7/
[12:22:53] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, that's a cool way to do it, but doesn't that require that you run through the entire array to sort it?
[12:23:15] <Whirl3d> Wouldn't that be less efficient than breaking out of a loop slicing and pushing...lol
[12:23:41] <johnkpaul> check in jsperf, on your size of array, there's going to be no difference
[12:23:48] <johnkpaul> I am all about maintainable and understandable code
[12:24:04] <johnkpaul> I think it's a lot more difficult to understand what's going on with splicing and removing elements while you loop
[12:24:09] <johnkpaul> and it's much more prone to bugs
[12:24:20] <Whirl3d> Cool. I can see that logic.
[12:25:01] <johnkpaul> if your array was orders of magnitude larger, I could see it being something to look more into, although splicing might be slower in that case too
[12:25:28] <johnkpaul> I don't know how js arrays are implemented
[12:27:11] <Advocated> johnkpaul, yesterday you showed an example of sending multi parameters by autocomplete, i'm doing: http://pastebin.com/PL4DHENY but mine has rendering stuff after, can i not do it that way also?
[12:27:47] <Whirl3d> and if the truth be known, it doesn't matter for this project... the people viewing it won't care if I didnt prioritize. I was just trying to do things the best way...thanks for your insight.
[12:29:01] <johnkpaul> sure, no problem
[12:29:11] * anphonic_ falls over
[12:29:28] <johnkpaul> Advocated: I'm confused about your question
[12:29:55] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d, johnkpaul splicing an array is crazy fast
[12:30:07] <Advocated> johnkpaul, if you look at my example, that does various things with the returned data, which is perfect, but the only thing is, i want to somehow send some additional parameters with it
[12:30:18] <johnkpaul> oh ok, good to know Eviltwin
[12:30:39] <Eviltwin> I was doing some perf testing a while back for different solutions for flattening an array structure
[12:30:46] <Eviltwin> Nested many levels deep at points
[12:31:39] <johnkpaul> oh, cool
[12:31:44] <johnkpaul> both spidermonkey and v8?
[12:31:52] <Eviltwin> Let me see if I still have it
[12:32:01] <johnkpaul> Advocated: you can override _renderItem if you want
[12:32:11] <johnkpaul> but if you want to send custom data, you need to do what I showed you yesterday
[12:32:13] <johnkpaul> you can do both of them
[12:33:46] <Advocated> johnkpaul, this example? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache  what about the additional data?
[12:34:29] <johnkpaul> in the "source" property of the options object, you can do whateer you want
[12:34:42] <johnkpaul> as long as it calls the response function with the data
[12:35:08] <johnkpaul> I wish the jquery ui exmaple source had line numbers
[12:35:57] <Advocated> so i can do that, but still add  in a render item?
[12:36:15] <Eviltwin> johnkpaul: These bars got a little thin: http://jsperf.com/flatten-array2
[12:36:17] <johnkpaul> yes, you can
[12:36:23] <Eviltwin> johnkpaul: Put look a the ones of the form "2, *"
[12:36:28] <Eviltwin> Those are the ones that involve a ton of splice calls
[12:37:24] <johnkpaul> :) they got really thin
[12:37:31] <datarecall> afternoon
[12:37:31] <johnkpaul> I see it though, that's good to know
[12:37:37] <johnkpaul> I wish that there was a better abstraction for splice
[12:37:40] <datarecall> what is the best method to use copy to clipboard functionality ?
[12:37:50] <johnkpaul> datarecall: I think most solutions out there are flash based
[12:38:07] <Eviltwin> datarecall: I'm not sure there's any cross-browser pure JS solution
[12:38:26] <Eviltwin> Unless you're just trying to emulate a clipboard, not actually use the system clipboard
[12:38:34] <datarecall> i dont think it needs to be cross browsered
[12:38:44] <datarecall> well i want them to be able to copy a link
[12:38:51] <Eviltwin> By cross browser, I mean works in more than one browser
[12:39:23] <datarecall> any thoughts on what plugin to use for flash ?
[12:39:32] <datarecall> there seem to be a fair amount of jquery plugins
[12:40:34] <johnkpaul> Eviltwin: wow, so splice wins significantly
[12:40:40] <johnkpaul> I need to read through your code to see exactly what you're doing
[12:40:48] <johnkpaul> I just ran it on my own machine, which is why it took me so long to realize
[12:42:26] <Eviltwin> There are three different flatten_array functions
[12:42:33] <Eviltwin> First one walks the structure with a recursive function
[12:42:41] <Eviltwin> (Obviously slow due to the cost of function calls)
[12:43:01] <Eviltwin> Second one is a double nested loop
[12:43:23] <Eviltwin> Outer loop so it covers each index in the array
[12:43:40] <Eviltwin> Inner loop so that if the current index is an array, it gets spliced in
[12:44:09] <Eviltwin> Third one checks if there are any arrays in the array
[12:44:19] <Eviltwin> Then applies concat to [] with the whole array
[12:44:24] <Eviltwin> Effectively flattening one level
[12:44:37] <johnkpaul> ah I see
[12:44:46] <Eviltwin> The second is basically the DFS solution and the third is basically the BFS solution
[12:45:07] <johnkpaul> right
[12:45:12] <Eviltwin> The second seems like it would require moving more data around
[12:45:17] <Eviltwin> Splice constantly needing to shift elements
[12:45:23] <johnkpaul> yeah, I expected the implemtation of the array to be more like an array
[12:45:28] <johnkpaul> I assume here that it's linked listey
[12:45:39] <tfitts> does anyone know of a plugin I could use that would let me paste tab delimited text into a field and have it parsed.  batchgeo.com does what I'm looking for.
[12:45:39] <Eviltwin> I don't think so
[12:45:40] <johnkpaul> or there are some optimizations around splice
[12:45:44] <rzec> is there anyway to do a hasClass in a selector?
[12:45:56] <johnkpaul> tfitts: do you mean .split(
[12:45:58] <Eviltwin> I think there's just a lot more cost involved in creating new arrays for whatever reason
[12:46:08] <johnkpaul> Eviltwin: oh I see
[12:46:16] <johnkpaul> rzec: ".class-name"
[12:46:40] <johnkpaul> tfitts: $("input").val().split("\t")
[12:47:01] <rzec> johnkpaul, don't mind me, I am apparently an idiot today, thanks
[12:47:14] <tfitts> johnkpaul: thanks
[12:47:21] <johnkpaul> no problem
[12:48:17] <Advocated> johnkpaul, ive got that example working, literally exactly the same but a diff url, but i don't see where i add different data? basically i want to pass my request.term and tester: $('#testfield').val()  any ideas please?
[12:50:42] <subliminal> If I have 2 event handlers attached to an element, and event handler 1 executes an ajax call, is there anyway for event handler 2 to know when the ajax has finished?
[12:53:32] <Eviltwin> subliminal: Not without passing a reference to the AJAX call to the second handler
[12:54:33] <subliminal> Eviltwin, pretty much what I thought, thanks
[12:54:34] <tgodar> does everyone just use 'live' now for event binding?  A case where its better to use .bind / (click() alias) ?
[12:55:13] <Eviltwin> tgodar: No
[12:55:32] <Eviltwin> In fact no one should use .live if they want that behavior
[12:55:52] <Eviltwin> They should use .delegate or .on instead
[12:56:15] <tgodar> thanks, was trying to recall '.delegate'
[12:56:38] <jedimind> subliminal, actually
[12:56:48] <fedejp> hi everone
[12:56:56] <jedimind> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ and http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/
[12:57:14] <jedimind> if im not mistaken are global scope callbacks for when any ajax call starts or ends, you can use those functions to set some sort of state
[12:57:18] <jedimind> that your 2nd handler can check
[12:57:35] <fedejp> does anybody ever used www.smoothdivscroll.com?
[12:57:40] <Eviltwin> johnkpaul: So your solution is to pass that information in global scope?
[12:57:41] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:57:44] <Eviltwin> jedimind: ^
[12:57:47] <Woet> fedejp: no, you're it's sole user.
[12:57:52] <fedejp> because I'm having troubles with it
[12:58:30] <Woet> fedejp: I'm just going to wait until you state the actual question/problem.
[12:58:32] <jedimind> Eviltwin, no, just change states of something on the global scope, and just use his events to check that state
[12:58:59] <jedimind> like a listener or something that could change states
[12:59:03] <jedimind> i dont know, think it through
[12:59:05] <jedimind> :)
[12:59:07] <Eviltwin> subliminal: If the AJAX request is linked to that element
[12:59:21] <Eviltwin> subliminal: Store the return value of $.ajax in the .data() somewhere
[12:59:32] <tgodar> Eviltwin: so, docs on live/delegate are clear that it 'listens' on items that get added in the future too.   Now if on superseded delegate, I assume it behaves the same yet docs don't mention it.   Is the shift in 1.7 that adding a listener to say a class means we want current and future
[13:00:09] <Eviltwin> subliminal: Then in the other handler, you can use .done(function() { ... }) to run code when it finishes
[13:00:20] <tgodar> as in no longer really distinguishing currently in DOM, will be in DOM
[13:00:50] <Eviltwin> tgodar: The problem with .live is that most people don't understand how it actually works
[13:01:06] <Eviltwin> tgodar: And the syntax is designed to hide how it actually works
[13:01:20] <tgodar> So I should read the code... :)
[13:02:03] <Eviltwin> The behavior .live provided is called event delegation
[13:02:17] <Eviltwin> It's explained under the "Direct and delegated events" heading on the .on page
[13:02:46] <Eviltwin> And it's uses extend beyond simply applying to future elements that match a selector
[13:03:03] <tgodar> thanks, reading that now.  I think I lost track of the evolution around the time of /live
[13:03:03] <tetradon> How can you check if an element is not empty?
[13:03:16] <sphinxxx> how do I do something when curl times  out?
[13:03:25] <johnkpaul> Advocated: you can pass whatever you want in the source
[13:03:28] <thang> .length ?
[13:03:38] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: curl?
[13:03:41] <Eviltwin> This is #jquery
[13:03:45] <sphinxxx> wrong channel sry
[13:03:53] <tgodar> tetradon: != null ?
[13:04:19] <Eviltwin> tetradon: What do you mean
[13:04:23] <tetradon> tgodar: no
[13:04:30] <Advocated> johnkpaul, thats what i cant work out, i only want to send across { term: request.term, test: "test" } or similar
[13:04:32] <Eviltwin> You mean detect <div id="a"></div> ?
[13:04:41] <Eviltwin> Via $("#a")
[13:04:48] <gowie> Hey all, I know this just the straight jQuery channel, but none in the jQM channel seems to be around, so I thought I would open the question up here as well. Hope thats alright. does anybody know if there is a way I can fix the fact that
[13:04:48] <gowie> 	my header bar title gets overwritten by buttons? Here is an example of
[13:04:48] <gowie> 	what I mean: http://i.imgur.com/ErYKY.jpg .  I have a title there, it says 'Detail', but it is just kicked out of
[13:04:48] <gowie> 	the way by the buttons
[13:05:14] <johnkpaul> Advocated: did you understand that example from the jquery ui docs?
[13:05:25] <johnkpaul> in that example, it uses getJSON()
[13:05:30] <johnkpaul> but you can use $.ajaz
[13:05:32] <johnkpaul> ajax*
[13:05:36] <johnkpaul> and pass whatever you want as the data
[13:06:25] <fission6> how can i highlight the border of the closest parent('div') to the element where the mouse was clicked and just apply the border to immediate div
[13:08:11] <Eviltwin> fission6: What?
[13:08:36] <Advocated> johnkpaul, like  $.ajax({ url: "/autocomplete.php", data: {term: request, test: "test}, dataType: "json", type: "POST", success: function(data){ response(data); }  }); ?
[13:08:45] <johnkpaul> yes Advocated, exactly
[13:08:54] <fission6> when a use clicks anywhere on the page, i want to change the border of the closests parent div, Eviltwin
[13:09:32] <Eviltwin> $(document).click(function(e) { $(e.target).closest("div").css("border", ...); });
[13:09:33] <tetradon> Eviltwin: No, but I figured it out. tgodar was on the right track. var contents = $('#id').innerHtml; if(contents == null)
[13:09:46] <Eviltwin> That won't work
[13:09:58] <gar_onn> .html()
[13:10:00] <tgodar> string method there
[13:10:05] <fission6> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/TEXuc/
[13:10:13] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Look at what tetradon just wrote :D
[13:10:30] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: heh, exactly :)
[13:10:34] <Eviltwin> fission6: One of these things is not like the other
[13:10:49] <fedejp> guys, i've got a proble with smoothdivscroll. check it out: www.lazza.com.mx/ee/index.php/obras please
[13:11:15] <Eviltwin> fission6: Did you look at the console?
[13:11:17] <Eviltwin> The errors?
[13:12:03] <fedejp> the thing is that sometimes (not always) the scroll doesn't work and just one image is displayed
[13:12:30] <methoddk> can someone check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/aRsmV/ :: and tell me if theres any problems with the JS code/
[13:12:31] <methoddk> ?
[13:12:41] <Advocated> johnkpaul, whilst it shows my auto complete data(ie the returns) it doesn't pass the additional parameter. http://jsfiddle.net/TA5cN/ it just says poo is bool false :/ any ideas?
[13:13:07] <fedejp> and when you lead the scroll with the mouse it stops suddenly =S
[13:13:55] <johnkpaul> Advocated: where does it say poo is false
[13:13:59] <johnkpaul> hah, can't believe I just typed that
[13:14:01] <johnkpaul> in your php?
[13:14:29] <Whirl3d> poo is true!
[13:14:31] <Eviltwin> It's Pooh, by the way...
[13:14:50] <bobbytek> Is there a more terse way to express: $channels.add($vendors) ?
[13:14:51] <Advocated> lol, yeah johnkpaul : http://pastebin.com/TrUcarE7  line 25
[13:14:52] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:14:57] <bobbytek> I was looking for an array version
[13:15:02] <Advocated> i couldnt think of another test variable lol, poo came to mind
[13:15:14] <johnkpaul> Advocated: you're checking GET
[13:15:14] <bobbytek> Having a hard time finding the docs for the jQuery function itself, lol
[13:15:25] <johnkpaul> but you're sending the ajax through post
[13:15:28] <johnkpaul> so it should be false
[13:15:33] <johnkpaul> I'ma ssuming codeigniter returns false
[13:15:34] <Eviltwin> bobbytek: ?
[13:15:40] <johnkpaul> if there's no parameter of that name
[13:16:07] <bobbytek> $([$channels, $vendors]) <-- that legal?
[13:16:10] <Eviltwin> No
[13:16:15] <bobbytek> aight, thanks :)
[13:16:24] <Eviltwin> Unless $channels and $vendors are both elements and not jQuery objects
[13:16:35] <bobbytek> alas, they are not
[13:17:55] <Advocated> johnkpaul, if i change both the gets to post nothing works.. if i change it back to post, it returns the data :S
[13:18:11] <fedejp> anybody has use smoothdivscroll? check out http://www.lazza.com.mx/ee/index.php/obras
[13:18:12] <johnkpaul> you mean in your php?
[13:18:14] <djayb6> hey I posted a question on stackoverflow, it was easier to describe my problem, if you can have a look, here is the link http://bit.ly/H4Urty
[13:18:20] <johnkpaul> if you send it from javascript using post, it should be read using post on your backend
[13:18:47] <methoddk> can someone check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/aRsmV/ :: and tell me if theres any problems with the JS code? My animations work for everything else, but when I call that function the first animation does nothing.
[13:18:47] <tetradon> eviltwin: correction: var contents = $('#news_feed').text(); if(contents == '') { } thanks a lot for nothing.
[13:19:05] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxcomplete
[13:19:05] <bot-t> .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[13:19:25] <johnkpaul> djayb6: I think that ajaxcomplete fires after the success handlers
[13:19:48] <Advocated> johnkpaul, actually $_SESSION['teaaaapoo'] = $this->input->post('poo');  works fine, but if i change the other to get  $data = $this->autocomplete->get_data($this->input->post('term'));  it returns nothing. Any suggestions?
[13:19:52] <djayb6> let me test
[13:20:19] <johnkpaul> Advocated: no, if it's getting to your backend, it's a php issue
[13:20:24] <johnkpaul> and a very confusing one at that
[13:20:34] <johnkpaul> perhaps check the post superglobal
[13:21:04] <djayb6> johnkpaul no it also fires before .done()
[13:21:20] <djayb6> could it be due to done() itself ?
[13:21:47] <djayb6> should I use default 'success' callback inside $.ajax ?
[13:22:45] <Advocated> johnkpaul, im doing: $_SESSION['allpostssterm'] = $this->input->post('term');  but its showing:  ["allpostssterm"]=> array(1) { ["term"]=> string(2) "ab" } }
[13:23:19] <johnkpaul> djayb6: are those your only ajax calls? do you really need to set the global ajax handler?
[13:23:33] <johnkpaul> Advocated: that seems to me like it is working
[13:24:13] <Advocated> johnkpaul, it works, if i change: data: {term: request, poo: "bear"  to data: {poo: "bear"}  its like it already sends request by itself, as "term" ?
[13:24:37] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know
[13:25:01] <djayb6> there will be more ajax calls in the future, but I thought it was cleaner to use .ajaxSuccess instead of calling the routine function inside each .done() callback
[13:26:35] <johnkpaul> djayb6: if that's the case, I'd probably try to wrap $.ajax with something that will add routine
[13:26:42] <johnkpaul> that has the same signature
[13:29:23] <feyd> I'm building an anchor href on a page that is composed from form values on the page. I have no problem creating the href on page load, but can I re-create the href from the current form values everytime I click the anchor?
[13:30:13] <feyd> a.click( href= this.val + that.val + this.val, return true) or something similar. Just making sure it's possible and I'm not an idiot
[13:30:32] <andornaut> is this the proper way to select the first item in a <select>? $('<select>').find('OPTION:first').prop('selected', true);
[13:36:46] <yakko> andornaut: $("#select3 option[selected]")
[13:37:10] <yakko> splitting with a find will also work
[13:37:21] <andornaut> yakko: i meant to ask if was the right way to set the val of the select to the first <option>
[13:37:49] <shoky> $('select').find('option:first').attr('selected','selected')
[13:37:54] <shoky> for all selects
[13:37:54] <yakko> andornaut: you want to set it?
[13:38:05] <andornaut> yakko: yep
[13:38:07] <yakko> shoky: +1
[13:38:33] <yakko> that's so not what select means specially when we're talking about selects
[13:38:44] <shoky> it's not?
[13:38:57] <andornaut> shoky: just curious, why the attr over the prop in this instance?
[13:39:12] <shoky> andornaut because it's an attribute, not a property
[13:41:09] <andornaut> shoky: hm, well there is a "selected" property on HTMLOptionElement
[13:41:24] <andornaut> at least in the latest FF and Chrom
[13:41:26] <andornaut> *chrome
[13:43:13] <vinx> hi all, i have an issue to create a "collection" of a custom type.. have a look here.. http://bpaste.net/show/25946/
[13:43:24] <vinx> i need to access to these elments...
[13:43:50] <Eviltwin> Um...how does this relate to jQuery?
[13:45:06] <methoddk> can someone please check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/aRsmV/ and tell me if theres any problems with the JS code? My animations work for everything else, but when I call that function the first animation does nothing.
[13:45:48] <Eviltwin> Are these CSS3 animations?
[13:46:50] <shoky> andornaut there's both a property and an attribute, but setting the attribute also sets the property
[13:46:55] <shoky> and vice versa i guess
[13:47:25] <Eviltwin> shoky: In this case maybe but not in general
[13:47:28] <Innocentus> QUESTION: There is an horizontally scrollable area with relative width. With two buttons the user can scroll
[13:47:47] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: You don't need to put "QUESTION:" in front of every question
[13:48:01] <Innocentus> currently the scrollable div is scrolled by a relative value (f.ex. 50%)
[13:48:11] <shoky> yeah i didn't mean in general
[13:48:35] <Innocentus> how can I let it scroll that allways _complete_ elements are shown
[13:48:44] <Innocentus> because after some scrolling, the elements are shown halfways
[13:49:01] <Innocentus> because it is simply scrolled by relative value
[13:49:16] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding your questions.
[13:49:23] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Innocentus
[13:49:24] <bot-t> Innocentus, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:49:57] <KristofV> I'm trying to change a single select (dropdown) into cascading selects. Currently all the hierarchy between categories is shown by the number of dashes before the category name. http://pastebin.com/A41ukdAV
[13:50:08] <Innocentus> I am looking for a description / name for this kind of prolem
[13:50:12] <Innocentus> *problem
[13:50:28] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: I am looking for a better description of the problem, one that I can actually understand.
[13:50:29] <gar_onn> nesting
[13:50:49] <gar_onn> dropdowns or something
[13:50:51] <Innocentus> ah
[13:50:58] <gar_onn> You can do that with CSS
[13:51:07] <Innocentus> Can anyone recommend a good carousel plugin to me? :)
[13:51:42] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery carousel @ Innocentus
[13:51:43] <bot-t> Innocentus, jQuery Carousel - http://thomaslanciaux.pro/jquery/jquery_carousel.htm
[13:52:09] <Eviltwin> Innocentus: Or look at these: http://www.pixelzdesign.com/blog_view.php?id=55
[13:53:12] <AndreLima> Check :http://nivo.dev7studios.com/
[13:56:36] <shoky> andornaut actually after reading some it seems it's better to set the property and not the attribute in this case
[13:56:48] <converge> My website is loading slow because i have to load a lot of images at the index page, someone have some idea in how could i improve it ? www.fortunata.com.br
[13:57:50] <AndreLima> try to use css sprites
[13:57:58] <xmaddness> yeah sprites
[13:58:32] <converge> AndreLima, xmaddness: is it for me?
[13:58:35] <KristofV> I have created a jsfiddle for my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/8CMEM/ I want to transform this select into cascading selects, is that possible using jQuery? If so, what plugins should I look at?
[13:58:44] <xmaddness> converge, yes.
[13:58:49] <AndreLima> aye soz, forgot to tell it was for ya
[13:59:02] <xmaddness> Sprites is putting all your images into one file, and pushing the images around
[13:59:23] <KristofV> converge: you can use spritecow, very helpful
[14:00:28] <xmaddness> converge, http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites
[14:00:37] <xmaddness> start there then check out spritecow
[14:00:58] <converge> xmaddness, AndreLima, KristofV: thanks ill check it out
[14:01:34] <andornaut> shoky: k, thanks for looking into it
[14:01:51] <devkinetic> hi everyone, i'm putting together a slider that pulls content from ajax. i have setup a page for the ajax request, and i setup a container for the content to be pulled into. how would i, for example, make 3 ajax requests to populate my slider?
[14:01:58] <AndreLima> converge, np
[14:04:37] <converge> AndreLima, xmaddness, KristofV: I dont think it's what I need, because I have a catalog in the index page, and there is like 30 files (jpg)
[14:04:46] <converge> put it all in one file wouldnt be healthy
[14:04:56] <xmaddness> why not?
[14:05:21] <AndreLima> converge, trust me it will help a bit =)
[14:05:32] <xmaddness> more than a bit
[14:05:32] <converge> xmaddness: make the user open a file like 5MB is not a good idea and.. maybe he will not open all the catalog, maybe just the first pages
[14:05:43] <xmaddness> instead of doing 30 http requests, you would do one
[14:05:57] <djayb6> dv310p3r ?ajax
[14:06:01] <KristofV> converge: you use sprites for style images, like a logo & icons
[14:06:05] <djayb6> oops sorry
[14:06:05] <KristofV> not for real images
[14:06:15] <converge> I was thinking about something like a postload image you know?
[14:06:19] <djayb6> devkinetic check $.ajax docs
[14:06:19] <xmaddness> Oh this is images for like, items in a store?
[14:06:22] <converge> KristofV: exatcly ..
[14:06:49] <converge> xmaddness: it's .. take a look, its an entire catalog www.fortunata.com.br (in the middle)
[14:06:53] <xmaddness> You could do the ajax load as needed approach
[14:07:27] <xmaddness> converge, are you loading all of the slides at once?
[14:07:48] <converge> xmaddness: atm, unfortunately
[14:08:09] <xmaddness> okay, what you would want to try and do is to load at most 3 at a time
[14:08:17] <xmaddness> the current one
[14:08:23] <xmaddness> the next one, and the prev one
[14:08:23] <converge> xmaddness: Im not a jquery programmer, is there some plugin for something like "onfocus open this jpg and the next 3 ones" ?
[14:08:38] <xmaddness> umm
[14:08:42] <Zzaichik> hmmmmmmmmm
[14:08:43] <xmaddness> not that I know of
[14:08:49] <xmaddness> but there probably is somewhere
[14:08:56] <xmaddness> I would just do it myself
[14:09:21] <xmaddness> I know thats not much of help to you, but you could possibly look up jQuery slideshows
[14:09:29] <xmaddness> or try the html5 stuff
[14:10:02] <converge> xmaddness: you helped, I'll read about it, thanks
[14:10:23] <xmaddness> here is a slide html5 example
[14:10:42] <xmaddness> http://slides.html5rocks.com/#notifications-api
[14:10:55] <xmaddness> erm
[14:10:59] <xmaddness> http://slides.html5rocks.com/
[14:12:04] <converge> very nice
[14:17:13] <besimo> nice
[14:17:53] <Zzaichik> triple nice
[14:18:44] <KristofV> cccccombo breaker
[14:19:12] <AndreLima> lol
[14:21:13] <andornaut> how can i do something like:  var li_set = $([]); for (...) { li_set.append($('<li/>')); } $('UL').append(li_set); Not sure where I'm going wrong...
[14:22:03] <Eviltwin> Either do var ul = $("UL"); for(...) { li_set.append($("<li/>")) }
[14:22:25] <KristofV> What would be the best solution, recoding an existing select into cascading selects (http://jsfiddle.net/8CMEM/) using jQuery, or using jCombo/Cascade and starting from scratch?
[14:22:32] <Eviltwin> Or var li_set = $(); for(...) { li_set = li_set.add($("<li/>")); } $("UL").append(li_set);
[14:23:02] <Eviltwin> KristofV: Never used jCombo/Cascade so if I was doing it, I'd probably do it from scratch
[14:23:18] <Eviltwin> Does the data have to be in the form you prescribed or can you make a JavaScript object or something?
[14:24:18] <KristofV> Eviltwin: it already is in that form, I can also pull the information from scratch but that's unfamiliar territory :)
[14:25:19] <dshap> hey all, i have an input type="file" element and on it i have an attribute called "data-my-info".  but when i do $(':file').data() why do i get an empty object?  given that i'm selecting all file-type input elements and given that one of them has a data attribute, shouldn't i see that data returned?
[14:26:59] <methoddk> can someone please check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/aRsmV/ and tell me if theres any problems with the JS code? My animations work for everything else, but when I call that function the first animation does nothing.
[14:27:14] <andornaut> Eviltwin: I'm trying the latter, and items has length 0 after the loop: var li_set = $(); for (var i=0; i < 10; i++){ li_set.add($('<li/>')); } console.log(li_set.length);
[14:27:32] <andornaut> i mean *li_set has length 0
[14:28:21] <Eviltwin> andornaut: You also didn't do what I said
[14:28:26] <Eviltwin> Compare your code to mine
[14:28:31] <Eviltwin> You'll see there's a critical difference
[14:29:53] <andornaut> Eviltwin: ah =)
[14:30:09] <raj> if I dynamically add an element, the click handler doesn't work for it?
[14:30:11] <andornaut> Eviltwin: thanks for the help!
[14:30:36] <Eviltwin> raj: Event listeners are bound to elements, not selectors
[14:30:55] <raj> Eviltwin, how does that play into this?
[14:31:15] <Eviltwin> raj: This means that if you do $("#div").click(function() { console.log("foo") }); then do $("body").append("<div id='div'>Hi</div>");
[14:31:15] <raj> since the element wasn't created?
[14:31:31] <Eviltwin> If you click on that #div, the click listener I bound before it won't fire
[14:31:38] <BaruchHashem> xec++
[14:32:28] <raj> oh
[14:32:35] <raj> Eviltwin, how do I solve the issue?
[14:32:44] <raj> i can't rearrange my code really
[14:32:49] <Eviltwin> Either bind the click listener to the element explicitly
[14:32:55] <asidjazz> you dont  you kill yoruself
[14:33:01] <Eviltwin> Or take advantage of event delegation
[14:33:16] <Eviltwin> This is where you bind the listener up towards the top of the DOM
[14:33:30] <Eviltwin> And take advantage of event bubbling
[14:34:00] <Eviltwin> When the click event bubbles up to this listener, it's checked to see if it matches the selector you specify
[14:34:03] <Eviltwin> And if it does, it runs the code
[14:34:11] <raj> interesting
[14:34:16] <raj> which method do you usually prefer?
[14:34:25] <Eviltwin> It depends on the use case for me
[14:34:45] <raj> how can I make an informed decision?
[14:34:51] <raj> like what do I need to ask myself?
[14:34:54] <Eviltwin> If I have a lot of elements (or will through the lifetime of the page) that have the same form and same behavior, I tend to use dleegation
[14:34:56] <Eviltwin> delegation*
[14:35:22] <Eviltwin> Also speed wise, if you're planning to bind an identical listener to more than about 3 elements, it's usually faster to use event delegation
[14:35:48] <raj> I'm adding <a>X</a> which is supposed to remove a select box...and there could be up to 10 selectboxes
[14:35:49] <Eviltwin> If you want to bind to one specific element once
[14:36:00] <Eviltwin> I would bind directly
[14:36:03] <raj> so each one has an X
[14:36:05] <Eviltwin> raj: Yeah, that's probably a good usecase there
[14:36:07] <raj> k
[14:36:11] <Eviltwin> Let me show you an example
[14:36:15] <Eviltwin> This will just take a sec
[14:36:20] <raj> thank you :)
[14:40:37] <Eviltwin> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/xzZz2/
[14:41:18] <arphen> what's the difference between var d=$(document.create('a')); and var c=document.create('a');
[14:41:53] <Eviltwin> One's an element and one's a jQuery object
[14:42:06] <Eviltwin> The first has methods like appendChild and setAttribute
[14:42:13] <Eviltwin> The second has methods like append and attr
[14:42:33] <pifantastic> arphen: also, you can do var d = $('<a>');
[14:42:36] <pifantastic> instead of the first
[14:42:36] <Eviltwin> The first refers to exactly one element and the second refers to a list of elements that can contain 0, 1, or multiple elements
[14:42:59] <arphen> i don't mind the few extra letters, maybe someday pifantastic  thanks
[14:43:19] <arphen> would you stick with jqueryobjects everywhere, always?
[14:43:23] <arphen> or is it ok to mix
[14:43:36] <Eviltwin> Depends on if you plan to do jQuery stuff to them or not
[14:44:02] <arphen> http://pastebin.com/RhHxVkEx
[14:44:13] <arphen> i'm just inserting in a list
[14:44:21] <Eviltwin> Well that's not going to work
[14:44:34] <arphen> if i do $(document.create()) i need to reference the array
[14:44:41] <Eviltwin> see ?.html
[14:44:41] <arphen> since as you pointed out it will return an array
[14:44:42] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:44:52] <arphen> yeah, that's a ref too
[14:44:58] <Eviltwin> Or drop the $() wrapper
[14:45:05] <arphen> my question exactly
[14:45:16] <arphen> this is not the first language im learning and i'd like to do it right the first time this time
[14:45:27] <arphen> does it make any difference or just personal taste
[14:46:31] <Eviltwin> arphen: Personally, I'd collapse lines 4-7 into $("<li>", { html: value.coursename}).appendTo(orig);
[14:46:54] <Eviltwin> As you're doing it right now, you're not really taking advantage of any of the jQuery object features
[14:47:03] <Eviltwin> So you're just wastefully instantiating a new object
[14:47:13] <arphen> suppose i'm going to make a deeply nested list
[14:47:15] <arphen> with 2 more layers
[14:47:33] <arphen> i have courses which consist of multiple lessons with multiple questions each
[14:48:19] <arphen> i know this is kind of "asking for homework" but what's the smart way to do this
[14:49:01] <arphen> make a triple nested loop, generate the deepest level first and append up to elements generated on the fly?
[14:49:52] <Eviltwin> Sure
[14:50:40] <arphen> that made sense what i wrote?
[14:50:44] <monk13> i have a .dayphone field on a page, and i only want to set its .css('display','none'), only if .cellphone exists on the page... how would you do that?
[14:51:21] <monk13> i tried something like: $('.someDiv .cellphone').end().find('.someDiv .dayphone').css('display','none');//hide if user has javascript
[14:51:41] <monk13> The .end() obviously just resets the lookup and doesnt do what i want
[14:51:51] <monk13> which is like 'is this true, then find this'
[14:52:57] <arphen> how can i even formulate that... Eviltwin how do I use jquery features properly to keep track of which elements should be appended to which?
[14:54:37] <arphen> or doesn't it work with more than 1 layer of appending
[14:58:53] <Eviltwin> arphen: I don't have any idea what your data looks like
[14:59:06] <Eviltwin> I can tell you it's possible to nest loops for creating trees of elements
[15:02:36] <Okanspor> hi
[15:09:36] <raj> Eviltwin, friend just got in a car accident, gotta go pick him up, thank you for the fiddle, i'll be back soon
[15:10:04] <Eviltwin> Hope he's okay
[15:15:39] <shoky> raj, already added your X ;p
[15:15:51] <shoky> i did explicit binding when adding it
[15:15:56] <shoky> check yer pm
[15:16:10] <djayb6> that's crazy, a lot of people @ stackoverflow want the global ajax event to run before the local event, whereas I want the opposite (which is the normal behaviour x) )
[15:20:50] <methoddk> Is there a way to make a browser not scroll to the top of the page when you do a $('#div').addClass() ?
[15:22:28] <Zzaichik> It shouldn't behave that way..
[15:22:54] <Zzaichik> ..by just adding a class name
[15:23:16] <arphen> http://93.135.119.141/home/Mobile/ could someone login as peter//peter and explain why i'm only getting html-lists and not the glorious jquerymobile enhanced lists? i've been trying to call listview("refresh") but it doesnt help
[15:24:25] <methoddk> I have a list
[15:24:31] <djayb6> ok so i think i found a bug in the ajax events
[15:24:52] <methoddk> and when I click on a list item, it starts a function that changes its class for a CSS animation
[15:24:58] <methoddk> and it shoots to the top of the screen
[15:25:32] <tokam> I get the error: "jQuery is not defined" http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.17/jquery-ui.min.js
[15:25:33] <tokam> why?
[15:26:17] <djayb6> tokam did you declare jquery.js first ?
[15:26:28] <tokam> no?
[15:26:31] <tokam> ahhh lol
[15:26:36] <tokam> i imported the wrong package than i see
[15:26:41] <gehsekky> less toke, more include jquery
[15:26:57] <tokam> $this->view->headScript()	->appendFile( App_Service_Config_Global::getJqueryCoreApi() )
[15:27:05] <tokam> I just wrote UiApi there thx
[15:27:22] <Zzaichik> ?preventDefault @ methoddk
[15:27:22] <bot-t> methoddk, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:27:36] <arphen>  http://93.135.119.141/home/Mobile/ could someone login as peter//peter and explain why i'm only getting html-lists and not the glorious jquerymobile enhanced lists? i've been trying to call listview("refresh") but it doesnt help
[15:28:19] <superdmp> can anyone recommend a lightbox that uses valid HTML?
[15:28:55] <methoddk> prevent default still shoots up
[15:29:32] <Zzaichik> methoddk: I'd love to help you, but we need to be able to see your code. Can you create a working example with jsfiddle or something please?
[15:29:45] <Zzaichik> And I'll bet that e.preventDefault() is what you need.
[15:29:59] <djayb6> indeed
[15:30:05] <Zzaichik> Than put an  'e'  in the parameter of that events function
[15:30:56] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky he should teleport to austin and go out drinking with me
[15:30:57] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[15:32:36] <mastermaw> hello all - is this a known bug in IE9? i'm using jquery form plugin and receiving json data in return, in my case a line of html - "<div class="error"><img src="img/cross.png"> Please enter both your name and email address.</div>"
[15:32:44] <mastermaw> but in IE9 this returns as "Please enter both your name and email address.</div>
[15:32:53] <mastermaw> lopping off the initial div class
[15:32:58] <mastermaw> anyone seen or heard of this before?
[15:33:26] <Zzaichik> I don't get it. so it
[15:33:32] <Zzaichik> so it's not returning an image?
[15:34:34] <mastermaw> it has lost "<div class="error"><img src="img/cross.png"> "
[15:34:53] <ccmonster> hey guys, I want to have tabs on the bottom of a div, that when click, slide down to reveal content
[15:35:08] <Guest83885> so the content containers woudl be 'behind' another div and slide down to appear
[15:35:26] <Zzaichik> ahh - that's interesting. I haven't heard of such a bug.
[15:35:34] <mastermaw> see www.mawdesign.com/ginger
[15:35:43] <mastermaw> try it with firefox etc and IE9
[15:35:53] <mastermaw> just post the form without any data
[15:35:59] <Zzaichik> If IE9 can't handle that, there's no hope for IE.
[15:36:11] <Zzaichik> (like there ever was)
[15:36:42] <Zzaichik> works good in Chrome too
[15:37:07] <mastermaw> yes chrome/ff/safari all good
[15:39:15] <mastermaw> it's bloody weird no?
[15:40:01] <Zzaichik> yeah it is. Where's the js for it?
[15:43:24] <mastermaw> http://pastebin.com/MXPfdzbM
[15:44:45] <Zzaichik> hmm
[15:44:51] <methoddk> Zzaichik  http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/3/
[15:47:13] <Zzaichik> strange bug - code looks right to me.
[15:47:29] <Zzaichik> methoddk: missing the result_send function
[15:47:58] <Zzaichik> sorry, mastermaw, wish I could be more helpful.
[15:48:32] <Zzaichik> no sorry, methoddk. it's there.
[15:48:54] <methoddk> Zzaichik I left some stuff out by accident
[15:49:15] <Zzaichik> ah
[15:49:28] <Zzaichik> that's why I"m getting errors probably. :)
[15:55:35] <methoddk> Zzaichik http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/23/ its got all the right data now
[15:55:41] <methoddk> but its not doing the animate on click
[15:56:35] <Zzaichik> methoddk:  you should read this. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398760/whats-the-difference-between-using-jquerys-onclick-and-the-onclick-attribute
[15:56:38] <ngharo> methoddk: you shouldn't bind click in markup
[15:56:49] <Zzaichik> methoddk: yeah you're still getting a 'result_send is not defined' error
[15:57:06] <methoddk> where?
[15:57:11] <methoddk> I don't get errors in browser
[15:57:17] <methoddk> and JSLint said valid
[15:57:32] <Zzaichik> I am. In Chrome's console
[15:57:34] <haizum> can someone take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/2WNYMJK4 and tell me why it's not working with the content thats loaded by infinite scroll on the next page?
[15:57:40] <Zzaichik> when I click on of the li's
[15:58:55] <methoddk> hmm, okay
[15:59:05] <methoddk> well i guess i need to re-write my JS :(
[15:59:13] <Zzaichik> d'oh!!
[16:00:18] <mastermaw> fixed the problem
[16:00:18] <methoddk> the reason I'm calling the function onClick is because the template renders some data that I need to pass on to the next function
[16:00:31] <methoddk> mastermaw my problem,?
[16:00:31] <mastermaw> i had to set the header
[16:00:35] <mastermaw> no sorry
[16:00:36] <methoddk> oh
[16:00:39] <mastermaw> my own
[16:00:42] <ngharo> methoddk: you can still do that with data attributes
[16:00:43] <mastermaw> we've all got problems mate
[16:00:44] <mastermaw> ha
[16:00:49] <oojacoboo> has anyone seen issues with chrome repainting on a show/hide?
[16:00:49] <ngharo> methoddk: remove the onclick attribute and replace it with 'data-resultId="XX"'
[16:01:06] <Zzaichik> lol mastermaw, well that's awesome man! I'm glad you figured it out
[16:01:08] <oojacoboo> err. not really repainting, but showing the element
[16:01:10] <mastermaw> header('Content-type: text/plain');
[16:01:28] <mastermaw> fuck knows why
[16:01:30] <Zzaichik> hahah - IE… good god
[16:01:31] <mastermaw> anyway
[16:01:38] <mastermaw> cheers all
[16:01:41] <methoddk> ngharo how would I grab that from the html in JS?
[16:01:44] <Zzaichik> ;)
[16:02:34] <ngharo> methoddk: then you'd bind your click handler in JS, like $('.search-link').on('click', function() { var id = $(this).data('resultId'); });
[16:03:04] <methoddk> ngharo ah! then I could pass it on to the next function
[16:03:13] <methoddk> is there a way to delete jsfiddles?
[16:04:04] <ngharo> no, it's forever one with the internets
[16:05:35] <ngharo> methoddk: you can if you're logged in
[16:08:24] <feyd> I'm getting the cryptic IE error "'null' is null or  not an object" when using the .load() jquery handler on a select element change. The same exact code executes on page load, which works, but when it's called on the .load() select change (which relies on the select value for parameters), it says it's undefined
[16:14:04] <abjorn> coldhead you should teleport to austin and go drinking with me

[16:39:31] <hidensoft> how i can know is firebug open or not ?
[16:39:57] <hidensoft> or , is it possible ?
[16:41:56] <tronhammer> i think you can try { console.log('hey') } catch { // nope }
[16:42:47] <hidensoft> hm
[16:42:57] <tronhammer> nvm
[16:43:02] <WebDragon> when you're iterating through each() is there any way to identify when you're at the last (first is kinda obvious) item in the function(index) {} ?
[16:43:11] <tronhammer> lol, just tried it, I think that may have been my test for IE or not
[16:43:29] <ngharo> methoddk: can you update your paste with the data attribute stuff and the jquery on() call
[16:43:34] <oojacoboo> WebDragon: I like the count them, then set a var -- at the end
[16:43:50] <oojacoboo> and if var == 0 don't continue
[16:43:56] <oojacoboo> or whatever you want to do with that
[16:44:29] <WebDragon> so you get the count, set a var, decrement the var during the each?
[16:44:34] <oojacoboo> yea
[16:44:43] <WebDragon> hm yeah that'd be one way
[16:45:03] <oojacoboo> I like decrementing over incrementing it's less steps and cleaner
[16:46:08] <coldhead> fewer steps*
[16:46:22] <WebDragon> I gotta series of <sections> I'm adding a numbered ID to and each sections
[16:46:30] <oojacoboo> I'm sorry is this #grammarnazis ?

[16:48:45] <ngharo> methoddk: whats not working? its lookin good now.  see: http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/27/
[16:49:44] <methoddk> i couldn't even get that far :/
[16:50:33] <methoddk> ngharo my issue is I have this function I need to call: Dajaxice.lucullus.search(search_callback, argv={'query': query});
[16:50:40] <methoddk> to get the data for the .html(data)
[16:52:41] <ngharo> whats with argv={'query': query}
[16:53:18] <methoddk> it passes data from the DOM to django
[16:55:02] <miket3> when using drag n drop....  how does the page print?  WYSiWYG? or original layout?
[16:56:34] <mikkelb> yeah coldhead is onto something
[16:56:39] <Eviltwin> miket3: ?
[16:56:53] <mikkelb> let's at least add some soul to these words or what Eviltwin
[16:57:25] <mikkelb> to inspire all of us
[16:57:25] <ngharo> methoddk: ok what is "query", because #travelform doesn't exist in your markup
[16:57:29] <mikkelb> from shallow abcs
[16:57:37] <mikkelb> to soulful cdefgs, get it?
[16:57:40] <miket3> Eviltwin, I am displaying multiple customer orders....  I want to re-position manually  then print
[16:57:46] <ngharo> methoddk: are you looking to send the "resultid"?
[16:57:50] <methoddk> yes,
[16:58:04] <methoddk> I copied the jsfiddle to my browser, not working :/
[16:58:31] <ngharo> do you have it in a $(document).ready() block?
[16:58:34] <ngharo> see ?ready

[16:59:04] <methoddk> ngharo no, I don't
[16:59:20] <methoddk> I know how to do it, but I don't understand what it should enclose
[17:00:46] <ngharo> methoddk: wrap all your javascript in it
[17:01:35] <ngharo> methoddk: based off what you're saying here's how i think your click handler should look http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/29/
[17:02:56] <WebDragon> oojacoboo: I forget. does js allow for predecrement as well as postdecrement with -- ?
[17:03:04] <methoddk> so around everything just put $(document).ready( //all js here ); ?
[17:03:53] <kristofer91> Hey, i'm trying to understand everytime i use jquery on my website, you can actually see everything loading
[17:04:23] <kristofer91> a slider for exemple you can see all the "li" load so it's all messy for a couple of seconds and then it's correct
[17:05:39] <methoddk> ngharo when i add that around everything it breaks, nothing works.
[17:07:28] <ngharo> methoddk: you need to debug then, i can't help with "nothing works"

[17:07:48] <methoddk> I know. Just frustrating, thanks for the help though.
[17:07:57] <ngharo> at the very least, open your console and check for errors
[17:08:40] <ngharo> and .ready() takes a function.  so .ready(function() { // all js here });
[17:09:30] <methoddk> console shows no errors

[17:30:06] <oojacoboo> WebDragon: pre/post ?
[17:30:40] <methoddk> is .click() only for divs?
[17:30:52] <WebDragon> oojacoboo: --decrement vs decrement--
[17:31:02] <oojacoboo> why wouldn't it?
[17:31:04] <WebDragon> seems to work here :) no worries. I just TIAS'd
[17:31:15] <WebDragon> because I couldn't remember if it worked that way or not :D
[17:31:24] <oojacoboo> it's just a loop and a counter ;)
[17:31:29] <WebDragon> haven't used predecrement in so long
[17:31:31] <eddiemonge> methoddk: no

[17:35:11] <tw2113> i have a plugin that i'm writing, that does an ajax call to twitter. initiated via $('foo').tweetQuery(). I am trying to figure out how to return the successful result and append it into foo
[17:35:36] <oojacoboo> tw2113: you prob want $.ajax
[17:35:37] <mgl> eddiemonge: first, hide all rows. next, show those 2 columns contain input values
[17:35:41] <tw2113> would i do a $(this).append(result) ?
[17:35:47] <tw2113> or return it?
[17:36:05] <tw2113> $.ajax is used in it
[17:36:35] <VioByte> inside tweetquery you can $(this).append("WHATEVER");
[17:36:49] <oojacoboo> tw2113: you probably need an event
[17:37:21] <tw2113> hmm
[17:37:37] <eddiemonge> mgl: if you want columns then you should probaly use .eq as in $(table tr td).eq(2) after you figure out which column indexes to use
[17:38:18] <eddiemonge> tw2113: depends on which parameters you are sending to the API
[17:38:20] <mgl> eddiemonge: $(table tr td).eq(0) and $(table tr td).eq(1)
[17:38:33] <tw2113> i can fiddle quick
[17:38:37] <eddiemonge> tw2113: twitter is most likely returning json
[17:38:54] <eddiemonge> mgl: if you want the first and second columns yes
[17:39:23] <tw2113> yeah, i'm constructing a variable with the various parts, just the tweet at the moment, but trying to figure out how to get it into the specified div
[17:39:57] <tw2113> eh, i'll be back later if i don't figure something out
[17:40:02] <tw2113> i think i have other problems with it first
[17:40:13] <mgl> eddiemonge: i dont know how to do that

[17:44:16] <anijam> I have created a text and am trying to output it as a download. Everywhere I can find says location.href = uri however, I cannot figure out how to name the file.
[17:44:19] <eddiemonge> i mean your HTML markup
[17:44:44] <eddiemonge> anijam: name it something descriptive for your users
[17:45:19] <anijam> I mean the syntax. Nothing I do produces anything but 'download'
[17:47:24] <eddiemonge> anijam: what do you mean?
[17:47:49] <eddiemonge> mgl: slightly cleaner
[17:48:12] <anijam> I mean, I cannot seem to name the file. It just downloads as a generic 'download' file. If I open it in an editor, it's otherwise perfect.
[17:48:21] <anijam> I just can't seem to change the name.
[17:48:38] <mgl> eddiemonge: sorry my english bad, i cant undurstand clearly
[17:49:37] <mgl> eddiemonge: what should i do now?
[17:50:20] <anijam> http://pastebin.com/6YTJ9u8g

[18:01:55] <arphen> eddiemonge,  thanks for replying, i was afk for a sec :) that's just some leftover code, deleting as we spea
[18:01:56] <arphen> k
[18:04:35] <arphen> eddiemonge, that should not have made the difference
[18:04:48] <arphen> i will set up a sample page where my problem can be tested more easily
[18:07:14] <arphen> i think my problem boils down to this: how do i "rice" a list after i create it with "$(<ul>)"
[18:07:23] <arphen> i want all those fancy css styles applied
[18:07:49] <Eviltwin> "rice"?
[18:08:10] <arphen> im getting plain html <h3> entries as list items
[18:08:21] <arphen> instead of BEomgAUTIFUL jquerymobile
[18:08:34] <arphen> i think i have to "activate" or "refresh" the list view widget somehow
[18:08:41] <arphen> the docs don't say much
[18:08:53] <arphen> if i try to call .listview("refresh") i just get an error
[18:09:11] <arphen> i googled that and they suggest i use .trigger("create") to spawn the element
[18:09:16] <arphen> (that just does nothing at all)
[18:09:21] <eddiemonge> andornaut: from wikipedia: Data URIs do not carry a filename as a normal linked file would. When saving, a default filename for the specified MIME type is generally used
[18:14:24] <eddiemonge> arphen: did you change something? seems to be working now
[18:16:57] <mikkelb> At http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/ - minimalistic presentation of HTML pages - how do I put my newly loaded pages inside iframes (to avoid CSS conflicts)? I've been told maybe http://api.jquery.com/wrap/ but I'm having some trouble realizing that!
[18:17:01] <mikkelb> Or http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/17/ (though the thing won't work unless the HTML pages are on the same domain)
[18:17:24] <eddiemonge> mikkelb: iframes? eww
[18:17:57] <mikkelb> eddiemonge: Yeah, well I was told that otherwise the CSS from the loaded HTML pages would conflict with the CSS of the index.html
[18:18:19] <VioByte> the why use the same css names?
[18:18:26] <VioByte> then*
[18:18:37] <mikkelb> Yeah should I just use different names?
[18:18:42] <mikkelb> Simple as that?
[18:18:45] <mikkelb> Damn!!!
[18:18:54] <arphen> eddiemonge, don't i get rounded corners et cetera?
[18:19:03] <eddiemonge> on lists?
[18:19:06] <eddiemonge> not really
[18:19:07] <arphen> yea
[18:19:11] <VioByte> mikaelb it would be a good step in the right direction.
[18:19:17] <mikkelb> hehe
[18:19:23] <dogarrhea2> so i'm fully prepared to go monkey patching again in jqueryui, but here's the question anyways:  Is there way to close a modal without clicking on the x button?
[18:19:23] <mikkelb> thanks a lot y'all
[18:19:24] <VioByte> mikaelb then just .load() into a div
[18:19:24] <arphen> figures...

[18:19:44] <mikkelb> VioByte: sorry how do i do that?
[18:19:44] <arphen> do you know that feel when you have spent 4 hours a bug that turned out not to be a bug at all?

[18:20:37] <mikkelb> $(this).load(url + "#viewport"); like that?
[18:20:41] <arphen> everything was working just fine, the only issue was that i had a black and white icon on a black and white background

[18:28:26] <mgl> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/3675376 it works correctly sometimes
[18:35:08] <fission6> is there a way i can create an HTML object using jquery, and then attach it to specific divs using hover()
[18:35:14] <fission6> attach and detach
[18:35:33] <Eviltwin> ?
[18:35:47] <Eviltwin> An HTML object?
[18:36:10] <fission6> well a div
[18:36:31] <fission6> i want to create a div, and then float it in whatever div is being hovered over, and upon hover out remove it
[18:36:33] <Eviltwin> And attach this div "to specific divs"?
[18:36:55] <fission6> i am creating an affect on a table, where when a user hovers over rows, they get icons to dynamically pop up
[18:37:07] <fission6> i have NO control over html, only js
[18:37:29] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/ how do i fix this?
[18:38:25] <fission6> dogarrhea2: you got to post what youve saved
[18:38:53] <dogarrhea2> aw crap
[18:38:58] <dogarrhea2> it did not save ok i do over
[18:39:46] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/QBqFt/
[18:40:39] <mgl> is it right? $('table.datatable tbody tr td:eq(0):contains('+val1+'),td:eq(1):contains('+val2+')').show();
[18:41:52] <Eviltwin> Probably not
[18:42:50] <mgl> how?
[18:43:11] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to select?
[18:43:33] <dogarrhea2> bah. jqueryui is completely broken
[18:43:33] <ussher_> #kde
[18:43:59] <ussher_> oops soory. ^
[18:44:03] <Eviltwin> dekub: You didn't load jQuery UI...
[18:44:55] <dogarrhea2> hrm is there an option somewhere?
[18:45:18] <Eviltwin> Only with the most recent version of jQuery. Otherwise you need to add it under Manage Resources
[18:47:19] <mgl> eviltwin: $(rows+' td:nth-child(1):contains('+val1+')').show(); it is not working
[18:47:33] <Eviltwin> mgl: What are you trying to select?
[18:47:43] <Eviltwin> Not what selector did you come up with
[18:47:54] <Eviltwin> Describe the elements you're trying to select
[18:48:11] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/EbpLv/6/embedded/result/ I must be going blind. Can anyone tell me why the ul.Nav isn't being appended and populated for each section ?
[18:48:34] <mgl> eviltwin: just select first columns, which contain val1
[18:48:52] <WebDragon> there should be (next).(prev).top in each section, but with prev or next left off either far end, depending
[18:49:04] <WebDragon> and it should be positioned top-right in each section
[18:49:39] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: http://jsfiddle.net/EbpLv/6/
[18:49:45] <Eviltwin> Look on the left hand side, left of your code
[18:50:20] <mgl> $('table.datatable tbody tr'+' td:nth-child(1):contains('+val1+')').show();
[18:50:28] <gnarf> WebDragon: http://jsfiddle.net/EbpLv/7/
[18:50:30] <WebDragon> Eviltwin: oh for .. I switched that
[18:50:32] <WebDragon> I KNOW I did
[18:50:34] <Eviltwin> mgl: You have failed yet again to do what I asked
[18:50:36] <gnarf> helps if you include jQuery ;)
[18:51:00] <WebDragon> there we go. now, that's sexy
[18:51:18] <WebDragon> nice clean markup with all the extra trimmings only added via the script
[18:51:48] <mgl> eviltwin: i want to filter table by 2 text input. Search by 2 column values
[18:51:51] <WebDragon> makes it VERY easy for client to add a block (in something like a wordpress custom-post-type) and not have to remember all the fancy parts
[18:52:22] <gnarf> mgl: is it a very large table?
[18:52:25] <WebDragon> and it all auto-updates itself very nicely, and I get the added benefit of the lightbox :)
[18:52:55] <mgl> no not too big, about 100 records
[18:53:17] <mgl> i want to do like this $('table.datatable tbody tr'+' td:nth-child(1):contains('+val1+'), td:nth-child(2):contains('+val2+')').show();
[18:53:18] <WebDragon> I can't understand how it switched back to mootools
[18:53:25] <methoddk> would loading my scripts.js in the head or before </body> make any difference?
[18:53:38] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/QBqFt/1/
[18:53:40] <WebDragon> I want jsfiddle cookies to remember what I want for a default
[18:53:42] <gnarf> mgl: you might have better luck with $("table tr").filter(function() { var cells = $(this).find("td"); return cells.eq(0).text().indexOf( val1 ) > -1 || cells.eq(1).text().indexOf( val2 ) > -1; }).show()
[18:53:49] <dogarrhea2> so it's got the jqueryui now. i'm still wondering why nothing happens
[18:54:11] <gnarf> WebDragon: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/FVLJJ/
[18:54:16] <Eviltwin> mgl: Notice that your selector ends up selecting TDs
[18:54:21] <Eviltwin> And I'm pretty sure you want TRs
[18:54:28] <gnarf> WebDragon: just bookmark a fiddle that has the base setup you want
[18:54:55] <Eviltwin> You probably want something more like this: $('table.datatable tbody tr:has(td:nth-child(1):contains('+val1+')):has(td:nth-child(2):contains('+val2+'))').show();
[18:54:59] <gnarf> WebDragon: and fork from there --- ^^^ is my old jQuery 1.5.2 one -- http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/ is my "edge" one
[18:55:05] <dogarrhea2> k nevermind
[18:55:09] <WebDragon> hehe there's a thought
[18:56:09] <dogarrhea2> for real? i really need to include 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.core.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.widget.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.position.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.resizable.js"></script> 	<script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js"></script> 	<script src="../
[18:56:13] <dogarrhea2> just to run the modal?
[18:56:20] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/EbpLv/9/embedded/result/  thing o' beauty
[18:57:33] <mgl> gnarf: that is working wrong
[18:57:54] <coldhead> aw bless
[18:58:17] <gnarf> mgl: it should be pretty self explanatory how to make it work "right" - also - "working wrong" is about as useful as see ?doesn't work
[18:58:21] <bot-t> mgl, $("form").submit() doesn't work with named ... - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4652
[18:58:22] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[18:58:22] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[18:58:41] <methoddk> okay, so I got the jsfiddle to work the way i want in jsfiddle, but when I move to browser it quits working… what gives?
[18:58:59] <gnarf> mgl: if you wanted it to be both values matching, use && instead of ||
[18:59:52] <mgl> gnarf: yes i know that
[19:00:40] <dogarrhea2> bloated/complex/hard to get working
[19:00:43] <dogarrhea2> yeaaa. i think i'm gonna pass on this modal crap in jqueryui
[19:01:34] <mgl> gnarf: but cant filter just values. indexOf is equal contains?
[19:02:00] <gnarf> ?mdc indexOf
[19:02:01] <bot-t> gnarf, String indexOf - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex , returns -1 if the value is not found. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf
[19:02:32] <methoddk> http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/72/ <--- that works in jsfiddle, but when I move that code back to browser, I get nothing, no errors.
[19:02:57] <methoddk> could loading my scripts at the bottom just before </body> be breaking it?
[19:04:01] <Low_> oi
[19:08:10] <mgl> gnarf: woow it's working. thanks a lot
[19:12:17] <xion-db> hello guys... have someone tried jquery flexigrid?? i cant get the table show up in the client-side.... server-side script give me the json variable with all my registrys
[19:12:45] <xion-db> i mean server-side work!
[19:30:59] <tgodar> so, UI-ish question.  cant seem to set save callback function on a loaded dialog.  And is that best way to toggle subsequent 'save' action, say in a rename/create scenario where I am reusing the dialog's form.  Or do people usually set a variable / hidden form value?
[19:31:46] <tgodar> and by that first part I mean change callback function
[19:44:40] <fission6> how would i select the <a> in this structure http://jsfiddle.net/ytEmY/
[19:49:06] <shoky> $('a')
[19:49:54] <shoky> also you should close the tag
[19:51:44] <fission6> no thats a snipper of the page sorry shoky , there are more parent divs, i need to be more specific about finding the <a> relative to the <img>
[19:52:29] <shoky> so you link to a different structure and expect a helpful answer?
[19:53:13] <fission6> sorry, basically i need to get the <A> relative to the img
[19:53:24] <shoky> what does that mean?
[19:53:44] <shoky> you posted wrong html
[19:55:57] <methoddk> Just wanted to say thanks to all who helped me, I was on a track so far from where I needed to be. Got it working though.
[19:56:30] <gnarf> fission6: where does that <a> end?
[19:57:26] <fission6> ok i got it
[19:57:29] <fission6> sorry
[20:18:09] <amy_winehouse> jbar is not displaying the notification
[20:18:14] <amy_winehouse> care to take a peek to my code
[20:18:36] <amy_winehouse> Well they tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no...
[20:28:17] <fission6> how do i performa filter to find all divs with links, i have all the divs but need to filter out those without <a>
[20:34:37] <crutex> why fission6
[20:34:45] <crutex> maybe rethink your markup / problem :D
[20:36:59] <fission6> ?
[20:37:09] <fission6> i just want to select all divs which do not have links in them
[20:38:08] <ajpiano> fission6: $("div:not(:has(a))")
[20:44:55] <fission6> thanks ajpiano
[20:47:28] <methoddk> how do i stop an .addClass() method from making the list I'm applying it to from scrolling to the top?
[20:48:34] <gnarf> methoddk: sounds like mutating the class attribute is causing the scrollTop to get forgotten, perhaps save it / restore it after
[20:48:45] <methoddk> $("#search-results").addClass("animated fadeOutLeft");
[20:48:47] <methoddk> thats the line
[20:48:53] <gnarf> methoddk: if thats not it.. see ?demo
[20:48:53] <bot-t> methoddk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:50:18] <methoddk> In my script, on a click of a li element, its supposed to fade the whole unordered list to the left
[20:50:29] <methoddk> on that animation start, it pops to the top
[20:54:04] <gnarf> methoddk: http://jsfiddle.net/2BpDb/ -- doesn't seem its addClass --- see ?demo
[20:54:04] <bot-t> methoddk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:54:44] <methoddk> then it's the CSS animation?
[20:55:26] <gnarf> methoddk: *shrug* see ?demo
[20:55:26] <bot-t> methoddk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:57:05] <gnarf> methoddk: even fooling with width/height causes no scroll change: http://jsfiddle.net/2BpDb/3/
[21:00:47] <methoddk> gnarf http://jsfiddle.net/2BpDb/8/
[21:00:49] <methoddk> weird
[21:00:58] <methoddk> I made it fade on li click
[21:01:01] <methoddk> and it works
[21:01:09] <methoddk> which is what I'm doing locally
[21:01:13] <methoddk> and it acts all crazy
[21:01:49] <jayar> does anyone know if i can make a step by step form progression with shadowbox? i want to open a shadowbox with a form, click next, and have that send variables, and load the next step/page all within the shadowbox...
[21:03:02] <gnarf> methoddk: well - it seems that fadeOutLeft is working in that fiddle, keep bringing stuff ( like maybe the css/html surrounding #search-results ) etc into the fiddle until you can reproduce the problem - and you will likely have found your answer by the time you finish
[21:05:45] <methoddk> gnarf I'm betting it has something to do with loading the data via an AJAX request
[21:06:11] <methoddk> on the actual page, it loads the data via ajax after a search form submit
[21:06:29] <methoddk> so would the scrollTop be 0 always then/
[21:06:31] <methoddk> ?
[21:06:35] <gnarf> methoddk: unless you're replacing content inside the div - it shouldn't mess with that
[21:06:42] <methoddk> I am
[21:06:52] <gnarf> before you addClass?
[21:07:08] <methoddk> yeah
[21:08:29] <gnarf> methoddk: http://jsfiddle.net/2BpDb/9/
[21:08:36] <gnarf> in chrome, this doesn't seem to mess it up
[21:32:57] <methoddk> gnarf i'm trying to get a jsfiddle up, have to generate the html for it
[21:44:19] <jj9058> following the example in the documentation for jquery plugin authoring (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring), how should private methods be declared?
[21:45:03] <jj9058> or should i ask in #jquery-dev?
[21:45:15] <gnarf> jj9058: inside the (function( $ ) { })(jQuery) closure
[21:46:43] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.timepicker.js --- example -- makeBetweenMaskFunction is a "private"
[21:46:54] <jj9058> is it alright to put top-level variables there too?
[21:47:08] <gnarf> anything that isn't "instance specific" yes
[21:47:20] <jj9058> hm
[21:47:24] <jj9058> what about instance specific?
[21:48:33] <gnarf> jj9058: $(this).data('my-plugin') - or something similar
[21:48:43] <jj9058> sry, i just haven't found a good explanation of the scopes with the documentation's example. i just see tons of other frameworks for making plugins
[21:49:22] <jj9058> hm. ok
[21:49:51] <jj9058> i just have to be careful where i use that. to make sure 'this' is the object i want
[21:49:55] <gnarf> jj9058: scope is pretty straight forward in JS
[21:50:17] <gnarf> jj9058: this should generally be "an element" in that example
[21:50:59] <gnarf> jQuery UI uses elem.data('widgetname') to store the instance of the widget object
[21:51:09] <jj9058> but just inside the (function( $ ) { })(jQuery) closure, 'this' is the dom window
[21:51:10] <jj9058> no?
[21:51:31] <gnarf> jj9058: yes - if something is "instanced" it generally means its a "per-element" variable
[21:51:37] <gnarf> so store the "per-element" data on .data()
[21:51:58] <gnarf> "globals" can safely be stored in the outer scope
[21:52:10] <jj9058> ok
[21:52:30] <jj9058> that plugin you sent helps
[21:52:33] <jj9058> thanks!
[21:52:45] <gnarf> jj9058: thats built using the jQuery UI widget framework
[21:52:56] <gnarf> s/framework/factory
[21:53:15] <jj9058> right
[21:53:20] <AbstractAce> wazzup big j dawgs
[21:58:34] <methoddk> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/127/
[21:58:45] <methoddk> that is basically what is going on in my script
[21:58:55] <methoddk> minus the actual ajax functions
[21:59:05] <methoddk> only in the jsfiddle, it doesn't shoot up
[22:00:22] <gnarf> methoddk: well, you are replacing the content before it has a chance to fade out
[22:00:39] <methoddk> i added a sleep function and slept for 4 seconds
[22:00:42] <methoddk> it never fades
[22:01:00] <gnarf> methoddk: that sleep function wont do anything other than lock the browser for 4 seconds
[22:01:04] <gnarf> ?mdc setTimeout
[22:01:05] <bot-t> gnarf, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[22:01:28] <methoddk> the sleep function works for me in safari
[22:02:37] <gnarf> methoddk: http://jsfiddle.net/WeCfS/128/ -- i don't care if it "works" or not - its a REALLY bad idea -- use setTimeout
[22:03:41] <systemfault> lol @ the sleep function
[22:04:23] <methoddk> hey, i didn't know any better
[22:04:29] <methoddk> i googled and thats what i found
[22:04:30] <systemfault> It's okay :)
[22:04:34] <methoddk> i know now though hahaha
[22:04:46] <methoddk> okay so now that my snafu is fixed, still scrolling up
[22:06:18] <methoddk> LMFAO
[22:06:29] <methoddk> hahahaha, this explains why chrome was so looked up
[22:06:34] * methoddk hangs head in shame
[22:12:00] * AbstractAce sings Ganja in my brain
[22:20:40] <fission6> is there a pattern for detecting a hover over a link, have a small time out and check if the same element is still being hovered over? i basically want to see if someone hovers over a link for 2 s then make an ahjax request
[22:22:11] <methoddk> $("a").hover(function() { // do stuff });
[22:22:28] <methoddk> fission6 ?hover
[22:22:31] <methoddk> :(
[22:25:32] <gnarf> ?hoverIntent @fission6
[22:25:34] <bot-t> fission6, hoverIntent - Plugins - jQuery - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[22:26:19] <methoddk> fission6: http://pastie.org/3676144
[22:26:22] <jumbo[C]> hi all. After I remove() an element, but still have it assigned to a var, how can I test if its attached to the DOM or not?
[22:26:45] <culh> why would the mouse slowing down be a better event to act upon than the actual hover event?
[22:27:02] <gnarf> methoddk: doesn't work - that would always be called even if they left...
[22:27:14] <methoddk> oh
[22:27:46] <culh> that would slow down the user experience for experienced users: always having to wait a fraction of a second and making the user think the code is poorly done or something
[22:27:56] <fission6> thanks gnarf and methoddk will review
[22:28:14] <fission6> methoddk: that wont work
[22:28:27] <fission6> they need rto still be hovering on the link after 2s
[22:29:47] <methoddk> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/PsyHY/ can you look at that please? thats my actual code running in browser, won't do anything on fiddle, but does it look messed up?
[22:30:17] <gnarf> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/cZ7TP/
[22:30:48] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/cZ7TP/1/ <-- more visible :)
[22:31:03] <wycks> so there is no built in way to make .draggable work in multiple elements at once, anyone know?
[22:31:15] <wycks> on* rather
[22:31:21] <gnarf> fission6: ^^^ thats "basically" what hoverIntent does tho
[22:32:34] <fission6> that wont work though, its close but it doesn't do any checks if its the same element
[22:32:55] <gnarf> fission6: if you haven't "left" the element, it is obviously still the same element
[22:33:08] <gnarf> it sets a timeout on mouseenter, and clears that timeout on mouseleave
[22:33:21] <gnarf> and stores the timeout itself on $(this).data which is per element
[22:33:29] <fission6> right i need to do something once i detect intent
[22:33:47] <methoddk> elem.data("timeout", timeout); is that the mouse enter mouseleave?
[22:34:28] <gnarf> setTimeout returns a # that can be passed to clearTimeout to remove it
[22:34:48] <gnarf> so I store that number on the element's data cache to be removed in the mouseleave
[22:35:16] <gnarf> fission6: it obviously does what you said it should do, even on multiple elements
[22:36:10] <ngharo> jayquarry!!!
[22:36:12] <fission6> right so when does it make a call to a method if its over a set time
[22:36:12] <gnarf> methoddk: .hover( enterFn, leaveFn );
[22:36:23] <gnarf> fission6: setTimeout( fn, 2000 )
[22:36:24] <fission6> hoverintent looks great will play with that
[22:37:33] <ngharo> fission6: gnarf's code is doing "something" by replacing the link text, there you would make your xhr request instead
[22:37:42] <ngharo> fission6: but plugin ahoy! go nuts
[22:38:02] <gnarf> yeah - hoverIntent does what i just coded up, and more
[22:39:57] <methoddk> I'm about to just live with the list scroll up on element click
[22:40:23] <gnarf> methoddk: your ordering of ajax response/etc seems a little "wonky"
[22:41:01] <methoddk> i know. Because if i don't make the functions all inside like that, it won't pass to the browser when it needs to, then the links break
[22:41:17] <gnarf> methoddk: not quite true... what version of jQuery are you using?
[22:41:22] <methoddk> 1.7.1
[22:42:03] <methoddk> $('.search-result-li').on('click', function() {
[22:42:28] <methoddk> if that function isn't included with the Dajaxice.lucullus.search(function(){
[22:42:33] <methoddk> it doesn't work
[22:42:33] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[22:42:48] <methoddk> no error in browser console
[22:42:51] <methoddk> no error anywhere
[22:43:38] <methoddk> the only other way i had it working was to make all the functions separate, calls and callbacks, then use onClick="" and onSubmit="" in HTML
[22:44:48] <coldhead> gross
[22:44:49] <methoddk> caniuse: when I try to use jQuery to do the click and submit handling, and those functions aren't like they are in the jsfiddle, the browser does nothing, there are no console errors.
[22:47:24] <gnarf> methoddk: something like this might help: http://jsfiddle.net/PsyHY/1/
[22:47:34] <gnarf> methoddk: makes use of Deferred and jQuery.when
[22:47:37] <gnarf> ?jQuery.when
[22:47:38] <bot-t> jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[22:47:41] <gnarf> ?jQuery.Deferred
[22:47:43] <bot-t> gnarf, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[22:49:47] <gnarf> methoddk: there is another option too
[22:49:58] <coldhead> flash?
[22:50:13] <bugsy_> peepl hi!
[22:50:53] <bugsy_> need adwice with find()
[22:50:55] <tw2113> who said the F word?
[22:51:17] <bugsy_> Flash = F-word? lol
[22:51:25] <tw2113> there it was again!
[22:51:41] <bugsy_> shi... it`s me
[22:51:54] <tw2113> stop fucking saying that vulger slang
[22:52:01] <methoddk> gnarf thanks for all the help
[22:52:14] <coldhead> vulgar*
[22:52:21] <tw2113> yeah that too
[22:52:24] <gnarf> methoddk: does the Deferred version help you at all? cuz if that works, its probably the "easiest" way to go
[22:52:36] <methoddk> it works, but list still pops to top
[22:52:59] <bugsy_> guyz, can you help me with my little problem with .find()?
[22:53:02] <gnarf> methoddk: umm
[22:53:21] <methoddk> it looks nicer, but honestly out of the scope of js that i know, so i'll have to learn it that way, then try using it
[22:53:26] <gnarf> methoddk: are there any href="#" <a>'s that might be messing you up here?
[22:53:37] <methoddk> theres no <a> elements at all
[22:53:48] <methoddk> its all on list click
[22:54:01] <methoddk> so when the element is clicked, it starts function
[22:54:04] <gnarf> methoddk: cuz from what I can tell, there should be no reason that li click event should be causing any trouble
[22:54:30] <gnarf> perhaps its something inside the ajax query code itself thats tweakin you out
[22:54:35] <methoddk> it all works wonderfully, just sends the list scroll up to top on: $("#search-results").addClass("animated fadeOutLeft");
[22:54:38] <methoddk> that line ^^
[22:54:50] <methoddk> it might be, I hate dajaxice
[22:54:56] <gnarf> methoddk: http://jsfiddle.net/PsyHY/2/
[22:55:01] <gnarf> check that code out
[22:57:26] <WebDragon> I think I know what you mean, Brain, but where are we going to find a tattoo parlour at this time of night?
[22:57:28] <methoddk> doesn't work in browser, tries a GET request :/
[22:57:28] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[22:57:31] <gnarf> methoddk: just to test it without a query
[22:57:34] <WebDragon> xD
[22:58:26] <gnarf> methoddk: http://jsfiddle.net/PsyHY/3/ ?
[22:59:59] <methoddk> still nope / sends GET request, refreshes and doe nothing
[23:00:22] <gnarf> methoddk: what do you mean sends GET request?
[23:00:27] <gnarf> on the li click?
[23:00:32] <methoddk> on the form submit
[23:00:52] <methoddk> I think I may just have to live with it scrolling up for now. Thanks for all of the help though. Gave me a lot of great tips!
[23:01:09] <bugsy_> guyz, can you say me why $.post('index.php', {post:30, function(data) {alert( $( data ).find( '#posted_number' ) );}); returns object Window?
[23:01:34] <gnarf> bugsy_: um, that should cause a syntax error
[23:02:10] <gnarf> ?js {post:30, function() {}}
[23:02:16] <bot-t> gnarf: <function () {}>
[23:02:25] <gnarf> thats quite odd
[23:02:44] <bugsy_> gnarf: i just copypaste NOT ALL
[23:03:09] <gnarf> bugsy_: {post:30, function(){} } <-- that function is in a "bad" place
[23:03:24] <gnarf> i assume you wanted $.post("index.php", {post:30}, function(){} );
[23:03:32] <solidus-river> is there a way to tell if an object is animating or hook something to after an object is done animating?
[23:03:44] <solidus-river> actually, is there a way to check if an object is animating?
[23:03:47] <gnarf> ?animated selector @solidus-river
[23:03:48] <bot-t> solidus-river, :animated Selector - Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run. http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[23:04:13] <gnarf> also, see ?promise
[23:04:13] <bot-t> also, .promise([type], [target]): [New in v1.6] Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[23:04:30] <solidus-river> ooooo <3
[23:04:45] <bugsy_> gnarf: i accidentaly erase bracket when paste script here
[23:04:49] <gnarf> elem.promise().done( fn ); gets called after all functions in the "fx" queue (animations) complete
[23:07:10] <bugsy_> gnarf: point of problem is 'data' contains returned html-code of index.html, but .find() not searching selector and returns 'object Window'
[23:08:19] <gnarf> bugsy_: i wouldn't be so sure of that -- try using console.log instead of alert() --- alert() is bad debugging...   $().find() should NEVER return window
[23:08:51] <gnarf> it should ALWAYS return a jQuery collection
[23:09:21] <gnarf> ?alert
[23:09:21] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[23:09:38] <bugsy_> gnarf: at first, i was trying to use .load('index.php #posted_number', {post:30}); but POST-data NOT going to index.php
[23:12:42] <bugsy_> firebug, by the way, also shows 'length: 0', but 'selector:#posted_number'
[23:15:15] <bugsy_> gnarf: i know about .find() NEVER returns window, but... that it!
[23:15:50] <bugsy_> maybe it`s a bug?
[23:16:22] <bugsy_> and why .load() not sending POST-data?
[23:16:37] <bugsy_> maybe it`s a bug too?
[23:17:04] <Eviltwin> Oh, you found all those bugs, huh?
[23:17:14] <Eviltwin> We tried really hard to hide them
[23:18:02] <bugsy_> private Joker? relogin by yourself
[23:20:40] <marekw2143> hi, is there any alternative to templ plugin ?
[23:21:24] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: i`ve tested two versions of jQuery, but .load() not sending POST-data
[23:28:38] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: interesting that actaully looks like a bug
[23:29:04] <gnarf> bugsy[afk]: is the URL cross domain?
[23:29:05] <Cork> jquery 1.7.x .load doens't send the data attribute at all
[23:29:17] <Cork> 1.6.x works fine
[23:29:26] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/hWumu/
[23:29:34] <sgo11> hi, what is the best way to create .min.js file? I did google. found yui compressor. just wondering what the best one is or are there any python script or shell script which do this job? thanks.
[23:31:27] <gnarf> Cork: http://cl.ly/3A361T1H162A3h3H3Y1a works in 1.7.1 too
[23:32:09] <Cork> gnarf: and your getting a post call?
[23:32:12] <gnarf> sgo11: jQuery uses uglify
[23:32:25] <gnarf> ?g uglifyjs
[23:32:26] <bot-t> gnarf, mishoo/UglifyJS  GitHub - https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS
[23:33:01] <sgo11> gnarf, thanks a lot for this. In stackoverflow, somebody said jquery used packer. :)
[23:33:17] <gnarf> sgo11: where? because i'll go edit it
[23:33:38] <Cork> gnarf: ah... i missread the output from the redirect
[23:33:40] <gnarf> sgo11: we used to use yui compressor on UI
[23:33:54] <sgo11> gnarf, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3617347/obfuscate-make-file-min-js     somebody said he believed jquery used packer.
[23:34:10] <Xotix> is it possible to deactivate the scrollbar/wheel for my parent window e.g. if i have a fancybox layer? so just my layer scroll and not the whole page
[23:35:02] <gnarf> Xotix: html,body{ overflow: hidden }
[23:35:14] <gnarf> might help
[23:35:27] <gnarf> sgo11: added a comment
[23:35:38] <gnarf> thats a REALLY old question tho
[23:36:19] <Xotix> oh, didn't think about overflow: hidden … thanks :)
[23:36:41] <sgo11> gnarf, that is the first output from google when I do my query. :)
[23:37:00] <sgo11> gnarf, http://www.google.com.hk/#hl=en&safe=strict&site=&source=hp&q=how+to+create+.min.js&oq=how+to+create+.min.js&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=hp.3...96l3104l0l3527l21l10l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0.frgbld.&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=cc35e386d42a86aa&biw=1920&bih=992
[23:37:35] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/599911/what-do-you-use-to-minimize-and-compress-javascript-libraries
[23:37:36] <bugsy[afk]> gnarf: URL = self!
[23:37:39] <gnarf> thats a much better
[23:42:09] <gnarf> bugsy[afk]: either way - Eviltwin had it right, there aren't bugs in those functions, at least not bugs that simple... considering your first "example" of the call that had the "bug" also had obviously incorrect curly braces, and alert() - I'm going to assume that you are just using the functions incorrectly
[23:42:38] <gnarf> bugsy[afk]: I would suggest NOT using $.post() either, use $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: url, data: data }).done(function( data ) { });
[23:43:30] <gnarf> but thats just personal preference, i find the $.get() and $.post() shorthands to be clumsy at best.
[23:43:56] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: thanx for adwice
[23:44:08] <Cork> advice?
[23:44:18] <Cork> i just messed up :)
[23:44:23] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: `bout 1.6.x
[23:44:26] <Cork> and read my output wrong
[23:44:33] <Cork> ya, but thats not it
[23:44:48] <bugsy[afk]> whatever
[23:44:53] <Cork> lol
[23:44:57] <pneftali> hi guys - using $.getJSON, the returned data apears like this in the console: [Object { name="fzcxv zcxv"}] .... what's the right way to access it, data.name returns null....
[23:45:06] <gnarf> bugsy[afk]: both 1.6 and 1.7 versions behave they way they should with regards to $.post( url, data, callback )
[23:45:27] <Cork> pneftali: ex. data[0].name
[23:45:39] <gnarf> pneftali: yeah the [] indicates an array
[23:45:41] <Cork> pneftali: where data is the variable you grab the response in
[23:46:15] <gnarf> ?js data=[{name: "abcdef"}];  console.log( data[0].name, data.name );
[23:46:16] <bot-t> gnarf: "abcdef" undefined
[23:46:28] <pneftali> Cork: perfect! thank you! :)
[23:51:34] <bugsy[afk]> gnarf: thanx. i`ll try .ajax() now, but i think .find() will not returns content...
[23:52:39] <Xotix> bugsy[afk]:  are you trying to get the content of an external page?
[23:53:42] <bugsy[afk]> Xotix: something about it
[23:54:52] <Xotix> getting a whole page is simply $.post(mypage.html, {some data maybe), function (data) {console.log(data)}; data=source of external page.
[23:55:29] <bugsy[afk]> Xotix: i am coding 'autoload and append' on button click
[23:56:11] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: what element type is the button?
[23:56:41] <bugsy[afk]> Xotix: i`dont need ALL 'data', i need just some selector
[23:56:48] <coldhead> [Object object]
[23:57:27] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: you always have to load all the data when you fetch it from the server in this fasion
[23:57:37] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: the filter happens after its loaded
[23:57:45] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: <button id='post' offset='30'>MOAR</button>
[23:57:52] <Cork> ok
[23:58:45] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: $(parent).html($(data).find('#selector')) should be about the same as what .load does
[23:59:59] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: that 'offset' i sending by POST to 'index.php' (itself) and i want to append some selector to DOM (like in google picture search)
