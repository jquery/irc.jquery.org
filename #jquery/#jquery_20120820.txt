[00:00:17] <Eviltwin> Well AJAX is done by client-side JavaScript
[00:00:31] <Eviltwin> It makes a request to the server but doesn't run JavaScript on the server
[00:00:43] <Guest78706> ye, you're right
[00:02:27] <Guest78706> anyway all I basically wanted was to loop a div 'replaceWith' with a 'get', but I'm failing miserably
[00:02:56] <Guest78706> I should try studying the png again though and try the console.log thingie outside the function =p
[00:03:20] <Eviltwin> You mean you want to update a div on a regular interval?
[00:04:27] <Guest78706> yes
[00:05:16] <Guest78706> with a ajax get (which so far GETs a random_number.php)
[00:07:30] <Eviltwin> It should work something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/pNzjC/
[00:07:41] <Guest78706> but a while loop within the get function didn't work, and I'm not able to hold onto (store) the data received from the get function
[00:07:55] <Guest78706> ok, I'll take a look
[00:09:13] <Guest78706> oh, is the hashtag short for div?
[00:09:27] <Eviltwin> You're really new to this, aren't you?
[00:09:52] <Guest78706> I was hoping I made that clear in one of my earlier statements, but yeah :p
[00:10:37] <Eviltwin> $("#content") means select the element that has an id of "content"
[00:10:45] <Guest78706> k
[00:10:51] <Eviltwin> You should probably read at least some of this: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[00:11:22] <Guest78706> true. thanks for the link.. I often struggle alot with finding study material
[00:12:38] <Guest78706> I was just playing around anyway, but as usual got annoyed when something didn't work as I had planned >:@ anyway, again thanks (alot)
[00:14:47] <Tram> Good morning all. Anyone knows if it is possible to start a function if the fade in of a element is done?
[00:15:59] <Guest78706> also what u wrote didn't work for me, but nevermind it's np x)
[00:16:21] <__machine> if i have two .click() events on a link... one does e.preventDefault() and then opens the link target in a new page with some js code... and the other triggers some tracking code... how do i know which click gets fired first? will the e.preventDefault() potentially prevent the tracking code from firing?
[00:16:34] <Eviltwin> Guest78706: Did you make any changes to it before dumping it into your site?
[00:22:29] <Guest78706> I had div class instead of div id
[00:22:31] <Guest78706> works now
[00:22:53] <Guest78706> (or has worked for 5min but had to find out what my error/fault was before I replied)
[00:24:23] <Guest78706> anyway thanks alot I'll try and learn something from this and hit back if someone's up for helping me further if I need it <3
[00:40:13] <coldhead> LET'S ALL DO NIGHTERS AT WORK TODAY
[00:46:31] <coldhead> squeak i tell you, squeak!
[01:01:00] * coldhead np: king's daughters & sons - dead letter office
[01:13:48] <Godfather_> hi
[01:15:00] <Godfather_> $("#content div").hide(); <- how can i modify this to just apply the first level of divs? <div id="content"><div id="yes1"></div><div id="yes2"><div id="NO"></div></div></div> ?
[01:15:54] <coldhead> $('#content > div').hide();
[01:16:37] <Godfather_> thx coldhead :-d
[01:17:42] <coldhead> PLEASE TO ENJOY
[01:25:33] <jacta> how is it possible to send all this data (from #friends) to a url? - Tried this way: http://pastebin.com/qH2Mq8dL - but only got a bit :/
[01:26:09] <jacta> its pretty much data
[01:27:26] <coldhead> have you considered using jQuery, jacta? it's quite popular around these parts
[01:27:43] <jacta> is the post not jquery? :/
[01:28:21] <coldhead> it appears to be GM_xmlhttpRequest(
[01:28:25] <coldhead> i don't know what that is
[01:30:13] <coldhead> if only some of the data is getting through i would try JSON encoding it because that's pretty safe to sling around
[01:31:04] <ravenzz> it is a grease monkey script
[01:31:41] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[01:31:45] <coldhead> tres bien
[01:32:04] <ravenzz> which can make cross domain requests
[01:32:26] <ruby_on_tails> i am trying to make a live counter like the one in google analytics realtime, an ajax request gets a number from 0-100 and the counter has to move towards that number in a fixed time span, is there some quick way to do this ?
[01:32:26] <ravenzz> which is something you ( jacta ) cannot do in ajax
[01:32:35] <ravenzz> js
[01:33:09] <jacta> ravenzz, yep, its greasemonkey
[01:33:33] <jacta> how would I have to do it then? some data comes out
[01:35:39] <ravenzz> ?cross domain
[01:35:41] <bot-t> ravenzz, Cross-Domain getJSON - Documentation - jQuery - http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Ajax
[01:35:46] <ravenzz> uhm
[01:36:07] <ravenzz> I don't remember the keyword
[01:37:46] <jacta> ravenzz, hrmm - but you know what I want to?
[01:39:34] <ravenzz> send data to another domain?
[01:40:40] <ravenzz> if you meant to do that. why don't you have a form there?
[01:42:37] <ravenzz> if, for some reason, your script fails your website won't work as expected
[01:44:29] <jacta> a form on my homepage? I just though getting $_POST from there?
[01:44:41] <jacta> and just save $_POST to textfile
[01:48:36] <coldhead> just have a phone number and let the users call you and read you the data
[01:48:43] <coldhead> or provide a PO box they can send a floppy disk to
[01:48:58] <coldhead> sure it's not "web two point oh" but it works
[01:49:08] <coldhead> and it was good enough for my grandparents
[01:49:13] <coldhead> it's damn well good enough for me
[01:50:58] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have a date (var now = new Date();) and i want to add one week. How can i do that?
[01:51:46] <coldhead> Krambiorix: can i interest you in a lib that will make JS date manipulation far simpler and save years of your life?
[01:51:47] <Eviltwin> Krambiorix: Add 7 * 24 * 3600 * 1000 to it
[01:51:57] <coldhead> http://momentjs.com/
[01:52:02] <Krambiorix> i just found this: now.setDate(now.getDate() + 7);
[01:52:34] <coldhead> i'd rather stick pins in my daughter's eyes than do native JS dates
[01:52:40] <coldhead> and i don't even have a daughter
[01:52:47] <jarco> lol
[01:53:01] <Krambiorix> lol
[01:53:14] <Krambiorix> coldhead, then it's easy to say that
[01:53:26] <Krambiorix> coldhead, what if you would have?
[01:53:52] <coldhead> i don't know, Krambiorix, i just like using moment.js
[01:53:59] <coldhead> it sucks much less than vanilla JS dates
[01:56:36] <Krambiorix> ok thanks!
[02:06:05] <majd> Hey #jquery - using .delegate(), is there a signal that will tell me which of the selectors was matched? for example, i want to $(".data").delegate("img, input", "click", function() { // if img, do something, if input do something else })
[02:06:39] <quicksilver> majd: you can't check which selector matched, no, and they might overlap.
[02:06:50] <quicksilver> majd: but it is easy to tell if the current element is an img
[02:07:01] <quicksilver> if ($(this).is('img')) { ... }
[02:07:16] <quicksilver> or if (this.tagName == 'img') for that matter.
[02:07:34] <majd> quicksilver: that works just fine! thank you :)
[02:48:02] <tocka> just wanted to ask
[02:48:12] <tocka> has anyone of you tried blue imp file uploadeR?
[02:52:38] <guy> Anyone can tell any lightweight table-sorter that would sort using data- attribute, rather than column value?
[02:53:45] <radiodario> guy: you can probably build it yourself using sort and getting the data attribute on the tr or whatever
[02:54:29] <guy> I definitely could, I am just tired of building plugins for every thing that I do. This would be the fourth over the part 7 days.
[02:54:39] <guy> past*
[02:55:57] <guy> oh what the heck. it should be less than 100 lines.
[02:59:20] <Fratyr_> Hi. please help. I have this line of code, which doesn't work in IE7/IE8 and returns me "Invalid argument": t.sbtn.animate({right:10},500); // some explanation: var t = this; t.sbtn = $('.support-box'); -- objects are found correctly, there's no undefined, NaN or something like that. :|
[03:08:25] <Fratyr_> well... guess i'll have to try and debug it again myself :|
[03:12:17] <EnginA> is there a defacto history management for ajax UIs yet ?
[03:21:54] <Woet> what could, in jquery noConflict mode, cause mouseenter to get blocked? the snippet of code works in jsfiddle but not in a huge magento webshop.
[03:45:39] <guy> huh
[03:45:49] <guy> who could have thought. a table sorter in 38 lines
[03:45:50] <guy> http://drugduck.com/public/js/jquery.ay-table-sort.js
[03:46:09] <guy> seriously, what is in those 2000 lines that others use for table sorting?
[03:49:22] <majd> i'm using .delegate() to do something in a div with 12 <input>'s. I want the event to be triggered ether on click, or when the user presses tab to move to the next field. What event should i be specifying in the .delegate('eventName')??
[03:51:52] <alexbodn> hello friends,
[03:51:52] <alexbodn> i'm calling by ajax a login form, that triggers 2 redirects with jsonp. however, inspite async is false, $.ajax() ends before success or error or jsonpCallback get called. could you advice?
[03:52:32] <majd> oh, nevermind, i should use focus instead of click. Thanks anyway!!
[03:52:55] <xec> majd: there's no single event that will trigger for both, "click" for clicks and there are several keypress events
[03:53:15] <xec> yes, focus is better :)
[03:54:31] <majd> xec: for some reason i assumed that the event would be matched against the parent element, not the child that i'm delegating to. I was wrong :)
[04:04:10] <guy> radiodario:
[04:04:10] <guy> https://gist.github.com/8cd4d6b87f05608b6f39
[04:04:19] <guy> any suggestions on how to improve performance?
[04:06:48] <guy> It looks redundant to replace the whole tbody. but I can't figure out how to make it work otherwise.
[04:08:18] <granden> If I got an id number in an array. Like res[0] is an id of a div. How would I access that div? like $('#'res[0])?
[04:09:52] <guy> $('div').filter(function(){ return $(this).attr('id') == res[0]; }) or $('#' + res[0]).
[04:10:09] <granden> ah, need the + there.
[04:10:39] <keirlavelle87> how do you count the number of properties an object has?
[04:10:39] <guy> Yeah, the former is stupid. Ignore it.
[04:11:10] <granden> guy: But still its a way of getting it :)
[04:11:36] <guy> keirlavelle87: Have you tried to Google?
[04:11:51] <granden> guy: Thanks!
[04:12:07] <keirlavelle87> yeah, thats why i'm here :p
[04:12:59] <Krambiorix> hi guys, in a table i bind the click event to all table rows. When i go to another page and then back again to the page with the table , the table rows aren't clickable anymore.... What can be the problem?
[04:13:54] <guy> Krambiorix: demo?
[04:15:16] <keirlavelle87> ah its ok actually I've found it
[04:17:23] <masch> hi
[04:17:41] <Krambiorix> guy, hmm  that would take me a half day :s .... I add 2 times the click event to the element, can that be the problem?
[04:17:56] <xec> keirlavelle87: .keys.length might do the trick
[04:21:45] <keirlavelle87> xec: it did, thank you - Object.keys(obj).length - is what's working for me
[04:21:57] <xec> yes, sorry. Object.keys() is what i was after
[04:23:46] <Rickardo1> I have a wierd problem, I have made a "booklet" with images.. I load images on the demanded page by setting the src on the current page images. The problem is that sometimes images not loaded.. it just don't set the src.. if I go forward and back it works.. not the same images from time to time.
[04:25:34] <yuka> hello guys, need some help -> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/  , regex selector in jquery 1.8 seems to be broken how to fix it?
[04:29:05] <yuka> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/ <-- how could i fix the code on this link , to be compatible with jquery 1.8
[04:33:21] <alexbodn> well, i've put the waiting code inside the success function, so nothing to wait for ;).
[04:33:21] <alexbodn> thanks anyway
[04:34:58] <masch> http://jsfiddle.net/YA6EY/13/ <-- can anybody tell me whats wrong with this select-box-validation
[04:40:51] <serAphim> i'm using tabs, and the loading of links inside the tabs works, except for links which are ajax-loaded after the tab load. how should i tell these links to load inside the tab?
[04:41:36] <Cork> serAphim: you need to load them in the element for the said tab
[04:41:51] <Cork> serAphim: you should have a container element you can load your content in
[04:44:09] <serAphim> Cork: the container is created by jqueryui, as the doc shows under "Ajax mode"
[04:44:31] <yuka> anybody got answer for my jquery regex selector problem ?
[04:45:02] <Cork> serAphim: if jquery-ui loads the ajax call it expects html in the response, and if it gets an html fragment it should just work
[04:45:27] <Cork> serAphim: i thought you meant you did the ajax call your self
[04:45:42] <serAphim> cork: i'm hijacking links like the docs tell in ttp://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...open_links_in_the_current_tab_instead_of_leaving_the_page, which works for links which are in the html on load
[04:46:15] <serAphim> cork: links from ajax-calls after that (yes, kind of "my own ones")  aren't hijacked
[04:46:55] <serAphim> which makes sense, as the hijacking occurs after the tab load
[04:47:49] <Cork> serAphim: well there you have the link ui.panel refers to the new content element
[04:48:59] <xec> yuka: can you make a demo of it working with an older jquery and the same code failing with 1.8?
[04:49:25] <serAphim> cork: sure, but only in that function, which is called before my ajax call. i think i can't use ui.panel without a tab event...
[04:49:41] <yuka> xec one sec
[04:49:58] <Cork> serAphim: uh no its not before, its async, its called and yes ui.panel only exist inside that event
[04:50:30] <peterschmidler> I built a script that resizes icons according to the width and height of the container. My problem is, that the the last icon in a row sometimes jumps to the next line and sometimes doesn't, even though I divide the width of the container through the amount of icons per row to get the icon's width. I s anyone aware of any solution to this? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/zC2qD/4/
[04:50:31] <yuka> xec you mean the jsfiddle?
[04:50:35] <yuka> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11624345/getting-the-match-object-in-a-custom-filter-selector-in-jquery-1-8 here is the link
[04:51:21] <yuka> http://jsfiddle.net/YCsCm/
[04:52:06] <quazimodo> guys if i have $('#foo').change(someFunc(arguments)) how can i call someFunc with the argument being whatever the value of my select options box is?
[04:52:54] <quazimodo> $('#foo').change(someFunc($('#foo').value) ?
[04:52:56] <Cork> quazimodo: your really doing change(someFunc(args)); ?
[04:53:30] <Cork> cause that would mean that someFunc() needs to return another function
[04:54:16] <serAphim> Cork: when it's async it should catch the links loaded after tab loading, but it doesn't ...
[04:54:45] <serAphim> load - This event is triggered after the content of a remote tab has been loaded.
[04:54:54] <Cork> serAphim: no, it triggers when you click the tab, it has nothing to do with order
[04:54:57] <Cork> that was my point
[04:54:58] <peterschmidler> OK, the border seems to be added to the width, which caused the mistake. After I removed it there's only one problem left: when I resize the window to a smaller size, the icons jump around. How can this be prevented? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/zC2qD/
[04:55:27] <DonQuijote> Hello
[04:55:35] <serAphim> Cork: ok, and how could i solve my problem now? there doesn't seem to be an event when something in a tab changes...
[04:55:41] <Cork> serAphim: a sorry i missed that they'r looking for links in the content
[04:55:57] <Cork> serAphim: so what exactly is it your trying to do?
[04:56:32] <serAphim> Cork: hijack a link which wasn't there when the tab loaded
[04:57:15] <Cork> serAphim: your talking for ajax links in the content thats been forced to load inside your tab content?
[04:57:21] <Cork> or ajax call from the original page?
[04:57:57] <serAphim> Cork: there's a livesearch in the tab content, which generates links while typing
[04:58:12] <DonQuijote> Using Lightbox (http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and I would like to show the data box beneath the images always, because when clicking to the next image it hides for a short time and after the next image has been loaded its appearing again.
[04:58:45] <serAphim> Cork: but it could also be just some link which was loaded via ajax inside the tab content
[04:58:54] <Cork> serAphim: if you write your selectors to work relative to the link instead of from ex. the base of the document this should solve it self
[04:59:31] <Cork> from the page loaded in the tab you can reference the tab frame through $(this).closest('.ui-widget-content')
[04:59:48] <Cork> and just replace that if you want to replace everything
[04:59:55] <Cork> and so on
[05:00:16] <serAphim> Cork: that sounds like it's the solution :) let me try
[05:00:36] <xec> yuka: looks like that so question is answered?
[05:00:45] <Cork> serAphim: remember though $(this) is meant to be the link tag
[05:01:00] <yuka> yeh i am trying to do what stackoverflow is saying , but i cant seem to fix it yet
[05:02:28] <yuka> xec - http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/ - this is the exact regex i am tryin to fix for jquery 1.8
[05:03:02] <yuka> using that solution, but i can't seem to do it :( would appriciate if somebody who knows would help me convert
[05:05:17] <Krambiorix> hi guys, what does this do?                             cache = $.grep(cache, function(e) {return !isSourcesEqual(e.source, source);});
[05:06:10] <Cork> Krambiorix: it runs isSourceEqual on each element in cache and if its not true include it in the array set to cache
[05:06:34] <Cork> ?.grep @ Krambiorix
[05:06:35] <bot-t> Krambiorix, jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/

[05:11:41] <lathan> bot-t: really glad to see you again
[05:11:42] <bot-t> lathan, JQuerySprint/dev/irclog - All times are EDT(GMT-4) http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/dev/irclog
[05:12:26] <sk3pt1c> hello there, i have a slideshow that has captions it loads for its images, i've placed code for social media shares in the captions but when i change the slide from the first i landed on the social media buttons don't work, as if the javascript doesn't load, any ideas?
[05:12:37] <xec> yuka: i basically just implemented the fix from the SO question, so don't ask ;)
[05:12:57] <yuka> ok
[05:13:44] <yuka> thanks xec gonna check :)
[05:13:44] <lathan> sk3pt1c, you probably have the javascript for the social media stuff running while its hidden and they don't work the same hidden as with visible
[05:13:52] <kyrix> any austrian based js developers online perhaps?
[05:13:57] <sk3pt1c> the only one that works is pinterest, because it's just a link and loads its image within the link, twitter's button doesn't render and the facebook box doesn't appear at all
[05:14:14] <sk3pt1c> lathan: that makes sense, how would i fix that/
[05:14:15] <sk3pt1c> ?
[05:14:45] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I have no example....no context......no idea
[05:14:50] <lathan> ?livedemo @ sk3pt1c
[05:14:50] <bot-t> sk3pt1c, Please create a working demo of your problem on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net. Please include the JS and CSS dependencies so we can see what you're talking about. Note: the script panes do not need script tags, or $(document).ready's, that is automatic
[05:15:44] <ak> i have this element <a href="#hello" />, can i get the value "#hello" from it, some easy way? (attr('href') will return the whole url like http://foo.bar/foo.html#hello)... ?
[05:17:22] <ak> any ideas?
[05:18:25] <lathan> sk3pt1c, to make a live demo go to jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net and copy in your html and javascript so you can reproduce the same problem on that site
[05:18:44] <lathan> then we can get on and tinker with it and find a solution
[05:19:13] <radiodario> guy: just looking at it
[05:19:31] <xec> ak: iirc the "href" attribute on the dom element does that for you
[05:19:53] <radiodario> might be quicker to keep a data representation (i.e. in json?) sort that and then redraw the table?
[05:20:24] <DonQuijote> any ideas with my lightbox problem?
[05:20:49] <sk3pt1c> here is the code http://jsbin.com/ugegom/1/edit
[05:20:56] <lathan> ak, I can't reproduce that failure: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/E8utP/
[05:21:08] <lathan> ty sk3pt1c, I'll take a look
[05:22:57] <xec> ak: http://jsfiddle.net/qkrMB/
[05:23:32] <lathan> hey sk3pt1c, can you simplify that example any? and make it obvious where the gallery stuff is?
[05:23:35] <sk3pt1c> lathan: thanks. the buttons in question are in the social-shares div
[05:23:36] <xec> ak: oh, you wanted the opposite?
[05:24:00] <ak> hmm
[05:24:08] <sk3pt1c> lathan: the gallery is in the album-container
[05:24:18] <ak> thanks, it works now, i must be drun -.-
[05:24:22] <xec> ak: attr("href") returns only the attribute http://jsfiddle.net/qkrMB/1/
[05:24:39] <sk3pt1c> it's three slides with their captions and the social-shares div with the social buttons
[05:25:08] <sk3pt1c> the script for facebook is right after the body and for pinterest and twitter right before the body closes
[05:25:17] <sk3pt1c> the other long script at the bottom is the gallery's
[05:26:20] <sk3pt1c> lathan: do you want me to cut out all the extraneous stuff?
[05:26:52] <lathan> sk3pt1c, yes, please do. would make it much easier for me
[05:27:02] <sk3pt1c> ok, give me a sec
[05:29:03] <mussing> Is this right var $response=$(data); to var jQuery().response=jQuery(data);?
[05:29:38] <lathan> mussing, I don't think so
[05:29:41] <WebGate> Hi everyon, i have a little problem with a js line code
[05:29:44] <lathan> mussing, what are you trying to do?
[05:30:04] <mussing> I am trying to replace $ with jQuery for use in wordpress
[05:30:24] <lathan> ?noconflict @ mussing
[05:30:24] <bot-t> mussing, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[05:30:35] <sk3pt1c> lathan: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/mT5pz/
[05:31:12] <sk3pt1c> latha: i left two slides there for you and took out other stuff that's not needed
[05:31:50] <mussing> thanks.
[05:32:27] <lathan> sk3pt1c, so jsfiddle will put the <html> tags for you....
[05:32:27] <ScottG> So I have a 'selectable' bound to a table. Is there a way I can simulate (in code) the user clicking on the first row in a table?
[05:33:08] <lathan> ?click()
[05:33:09] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[05:33:13] <Clex> ScottG: $('#id').click()
[05:33:18] <lathan> ScottG, see ?click()
[05:33:19] <bot-t> ScottG, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[05:33:57] <sk3pt1c> lathan: so do you see anything? :)
[05:34:17] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I'm restarting my browser because i think it upgraded and is messing up
[05:35:57] <sk3pt1c> lathan: ok mate
[05:36:34] <lathan> sk3pt1c, looking now
[05:36:42] <Bonitadecara27> hola
[05:38:48] <sk3pt1c> lathan, ok, waiting
[05:38:49] <lathan> sk3pt1c, can you clear out the html, and body tags, and remove the head section. then go to "Add Resources" on the left and add the full link to the javascript libaries that it needs to run properly
[05:39:05] <lathan> sk3pt1c, like I did part of it here: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/mT5pz/1/
[05:39:21] <lathan> sk3pt1c, but I don't have the javascript libraries you need added from the jsfiddle menu on the left
[05:40:14] <ScottG> lathan: I'm still not sure I understand how this would work. Do I pass click() the function I bound to the selectable's "selected" event?
[05:40:27] <lathan> ScottG, no...just .click()
[05:40:49] <lathan> ScottG, click has 2 behaviors: if you give it a functino it binds it to the click event, if you don't it triggers a click event
[05:41:00] <lathan> ScottG, the more clear way is .trigger('click')
[05:41:04] <sk3pt1c> lathan: give me a minute to check it out
[05:42:55] <ScottG> lathan: Ok I see now. This doesn't seem to be working, though. Let me double check a few things.
[05:47:23] <ScottG> So I made sure I called .click() after selectable was bound to the element and right before I call .click() on the selector I confirm that it's the right element by logging it to the console...
[05:51:09] <sk3pt1c> lathan: does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/mT5pz/8/
[05:52:12] <lathan> sk3pt1c, you have to make it so I can tell what is going on
[05:52:38] <lathan> okay...yah...that is better
[05:54:13] <keirlavelle87> can anyone please help me figure out why this fiddle only logs the final error for this simple validation script i made?
[05:54:15] <keirlavelle87> http://jsfiddle.net/3JVtA/12/
[05:54:35] <lathan> sk3pt1c, there is just soo much in that pages HTML
[05:54:53] <lathan> sk3pt1c, you are trying to make as small and clean a page as possible that still shows the facebook pages breaking
[05:54:53] <Aha2Y> Can someone tell me why the jQuery script not works on this document?
[05:54:54] <Aha2Y> http://aha2y.webatu.com/test.php
[05:55:06] <sk3pt1c> lathan: yeh, it's the slideshow basically, it's got a lot of code
[05:55:09] <ScottG> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/ScPCy/
[05:55:35] <Aha2Y> http://aha2y.webatu.com/Core/Scripts/select.js
[05:55:41] <ScottG> lathan: That's what I'm trying to do. Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
[05:55:51] <ravenzz> keirlavelle87 let's start from the begin, 1) you could rely on the name attribute and avoi thi data-validation one
[05:55:58] <lathan> sk3pt1c, use the "Add Resoruces" button on the left sidebar instead of putting your whole html in. fiddle will do the head and body and html and you can
[05:56:06] <ravenzz> bind to the submit event instead of click
[05:56:21] <lathan> sk3pt1c, clear out the excess layers of divs....put a comment by the important stuff
[05:56:39] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I'm getting lost just looking through your html...and that makes it verry hard to help
[05:57:22] <ravenzz> keirlavelle87 if you don't wrap the form field into the label, you need a pair of id and for
[05:57:40] <ravenzz> for the form field and the label
[05:57:49] <ScottG> ravenzz: Submit event? Like replace .click() with .submit()? That doesn't work either.
[05:57:59] <keirlavelle87> ravenzz i attached the validation to a data- attr because its going to be placed on quite a large form which is made up of a couple of arrays such as name="creds[name]" etc so it's easier to maintain
[05:58:15] <ravenzz> ScottG it is not about his script
[05:58:19] <sk3pt1c> lathan: ok, give me some time to clean it up as  much as i can
[05:58:24] <lathan> k
[05:58:28] <Aha2Y> ?
[05:58:33] <ravenzz> it is about how he is supposed to do these kind of things
[05:58:58] <ScottG> ravenzz: Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
[05:59:05] <ravenzz> no eh
[05:59:28] <ravenzz> keirlavelle87 still I wouldn't mess with the markup
[05:59:32] <ScottG> lathan: Does that fiddle I sent you help?
[05:59:36] <ravenzz> it has to be clean
[05:59:41] <ravenzz> as clean as possible
[05:59:50] <lathan> ScottG, I'm looking....
[05:59:55] <ravenzz> just create unique "names" from the current one
[06:00:02] <ScottG> ok
[06:00:11] <ravenzz> eg creds[name] can be creds.name
[06:00:19] <ravenzz> eg creds[name] can be creds_name
[06:00:22] <ravenzz> whatever
[06:00:30] <Aha2Y> Anyone here available to help me?
[06:01:21] <ScottG> Aha2Y: You might want to give a little more detailed question than "why doesn't this work?"
[06:01:26] <ScottG> just fyi
[06:01:37] <keirlavelle87> yeah spose so - if you wouldnt mind having a look at this update which I think is the problem, you'll notice the console logs each character of the final error msg as an object property, instead of putting all the msg's as an individual property, can anyone help as to why this is? >> http://jsfiddle.net/3JVtA/17/
[06:01:44] <lathan> ScottG, oh...easy. you have the filter on tr, but you are triggering the click on the td
[06:02:13] <Aha2Y> ScottG, Because someone wrote me a script which should make the row clickable and bring you to another URL.
[06:02:20] <Aha2Y> http://aha2y.webatu.com/test.php but it is not clickable :<
[06:02:48] <ScottG> lathan: Are you sure? If I log that selector it shows me a tr element and not a td.
[06:03:15] <lathan> ScottG, right.....no...still working
[06:04:53] <lathan> ScottG, what you really want to do, is to have the first one selected, right?
[06:05:51] <YourA1gebra> morning all
[06:06:50] <YourA1gebra> running into an issue regarding compatibility on IE and FF vs Chrome… it works fine on Chrome, but it doesn't work until the second time it cycles on IE or FF… any ideas on this? http://jsfiddle.net/Ht7zd/
[06:08:23] <lathan> ScottG, try adding the class ui-selected: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/ScPCy/1/
[06:08:36] <lathan> ScottG, it doesn't trigger the selected event, but I think its the same thing
[06:08:46] <Aha2Y> ScottG, i told you :<
[06:15:11] <YourA1gebra> forgot to mention, it's throwing 2 errors: [cycle] DOM not ready, queueing slideshow
[06:15:11] <YourA1gebra> [cycle] terminating; zero elements found by selector
[06:15:24] <YourA1gebra> in firefox only
[06:18:48] <ScottG> lathan: hey sorry was afk. Let me try that.
[06:19:16] <lathan> ScottG, this is the best thing I can come up with: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/ScPCy/3/
[06:19:38] <lathan> ScottG, selectable doesn't have stuff setup to handle defaults....but it seems to act fine if you just add the class
[06:20:32] <ScottG> lathan: It doesn't seem to run the event, though.
[06:20:59] <ScottG> lathan: By adding the ui-selected class it just seems to apply the styling.
[06:23:35] <lathan> ScottG, no...the event doesn't run.....however, there is no need for the event if it is simply "starting" as on.
[06:23:50] <lathan> ScottG, and you can always call the function sel when setting the default
[06:24:06] <Glenjamin> hi guys, does anyone know where i can find an explanation of how jQuery ajax's script and jsonp dataTypes actually work?
[06:24:19] <Glenjamin> The docs indicate the error/success callbacks wont fire, but they appear to
[06:24:26] <lathan> ScottG, selectable uses ui.mouse which is a lot more indepth that I get into
[06:25:30] <ScottG> Ah, hm.
[06:25:55] <ScottG> lathan: I also found this and I'm trying to understand how it works at the moment http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8452833/jquery-ui-selectable-preselecting-list-item
[06:25:59] <lathan> ScottG, I know its not ideal, but I don't know enough about the internals of ui.mouse to sim it
[06:27:00] <lathan> ScottG, yah...that seems to be okay
[06:29:39] <keirlavelle87> can anyone please help me figure out why in this fiddle $.extend is adding each character  from the property I wish to add to the object, as a property itself? http://jsfiddle.net/3JVtA/22/
[06:30:58] <sk3pt1c> lathan: finally, i think i got it working for ya: http://jsfiddle.net/mT5pz/15/
[06:31:51] <sk3pt1c> lathan: as clean as it's gonna get, methinks. unless you want me to add the scripts as resources?
[06:32:44] <lathan> sk3pt1c, well....the resources would be nice for next time...but I think I got it w/out
[06:32:52] <lathan> sk3pt1c, what isn't workign?
[06:32:58] <lathan> sk3pt1c, it looks like it works
[06:33:39] <sk3pt1c> if you go from the first to the second slide, the twitter button doesn't render and facebook disappears
[06:33:54] <sk3pt1c> that's my issue
[06:34:08] <sk3pt1c> they only render properly on the first slide you see on the page
[06:34:28] <sk3pt1c> if you're linked to the second slide from outside, that'll show properly and the others get messed up
[06:39:09] <keirlavelle87> it's ok i've fixed it now
[06:39:33] <sk3pt1c> lathan: do you see it?
[06:39:45] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I'm going to guess that your gallery deletes and recreates the html every time
[06:40:03] <lathan> sk3pt1c, therefore what the social media scripts run is deleted after the 1st transition
[06:40:55] <lathan> sk3pt1c, my suggestion is to find a different gallery or a different way of doing the social media
[06:41:18] <sk3pt1c> oh balls, i was hoping against that :)
[06:41:43] <sk3pt1c> lathan: how else could i do the social media? i need to have them tied to each slide
[06:43:41] <lathan> sk3pt1c, you could try a gallery that doesn't delete and recreate the caption every time.....look for something like jQuery cycle
[06:48:24] <sk3pt1c> lathan: if i kept this one, do you think there's any way to keep the social media but implement them in a way that works?
[06:50:03] <lathan> sk3pt1c, you'd need something that re-runs their code after every swipe
[06:50:06] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I don't know
[06:51:05] <sk3pt1c> yeah, that's what i was looking for, can't i reload the scripts with an onClick of the navigation?
[06:52:15] <sk3pt1c> lathan: is it the scripts or the html that i have to reload? or both?
[06:52:31] <lathan> sk3pt1c, I don't know
[06:52:38] <sk3pt1c> i thought i might do a $("#controls").click(function () { and then somehow reload
[07:08:11] <sk3pt1c> can anybody else help with this?
[07:12:00] <rgr> is it my imagination or is the guy who packages jquery-ui a sadist? Each and every update seems to alter the url components at more than the top level.
[07:12:47] <sk3pt1c> i guess i have to get a different gallery then
[07:22:22] <stewbydoo2> anybody in here familiar with raphael at all?
[07:23:02] <NodeX> the bull fighter?
[07:23:09] <NodeX> or the TMNT
[07:25:08] <pachet> i thought they were the same dude

[07:27:16] <abhishek_> Hi guys,
[07:27:44] <abhishek_> i am using .is('hover') in my plugin
[07:28:00] <abhishek_> and it's not working in IE7 and IE8
[07:28:58] <nFFF> Guys Im requesting imag paths from server and building the html client side, however im getting this error: Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[07:29:00] <abhishek_> ???
[07:29:00] <nFFF> what gives/
[07:29:15] <abhishek_> uncaught expression :hover
[07:30:04] <pachet> abhishek: yeah, trying to use :hover as a selector will give you problems in IE
[07:30:12] <pachet> your best bet is to just toggle classes on mouseover/mouseout
[07:30:13] <abhishek_> any body help me out of this IE issue
[07:30:27] <pachet> and then check for the existence of that class
[07:30:36] <lathan> nFFF, that means the mime-type sent from the server is not an image
[07:30:49] <lathan> nFFF, it may mean the server is sending HTML instead of an image
[07:31:01] <VasiqMz> hi
[07:31:12] <lathan> nFFF, use your console (or FireBug) in the Net or resources tab to see the headers, and look for the content-type
[07:31:23] <lathan> ?hi
[07:31:23] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[07:32:24] <Aquaguy> Hello, I've a form that it prevents its submition, I want to send the form data using $.post instead of doing a regular HTTP post where the page gets reloaded. The thing is... is there any way to  get the POST variable ? or do I have to collect the form inputs one by one, create an object with them and pass it to the $.post function=
[07:32:31] <VasiqMz> I'm working on a program which uses jquery dialog UI to submit a form via Ajax but i don't understand it doesn't work..
[07:32:43] <juanlas> is anyone noticing jquery.support returning false when checking for boxModel support on mountain lion chrome?
[07:32:57] <VasiqMz> on clicking Submit it returns to the parent page..
[07:33:02] <nFFF> lathan, the server is just returning an array containing the image paths
[07:33:10] <lmao25> I have a form, and when I submit the form manually using .submit() I get this : Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[07:33:16] <NoiseEee> Aquaguy: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:33:20] <some_dude> why is the plugins archive on jquery homepage so messed up? jesus... no way to find plugins there except to google the damn thing and then you're not sure it's the same plugin...
[07:33:28] <nFFF> Im then using <img src=" + imageArr[i] + ">
[07:33:37] <nFFF> why would the header type matter in this case
[07:33:49] <Aquaguy> VasiqMz, I guess you should prevent the default behaviour of the form by doing event.preventDefault();
[07:34:34] <Aquaguy> NoiseEee, wow didn't know .serialize() existed, thank you so much!
[07:34:38] <pachet> nFFF: it probably won't make a difference, but try putting hard quotes around the path
[07:34:52] <pachet> nFFF: eg $('<img src="' + path +'" />')
[07:35:22] <quicksilver> $('<img>').attr('src',path)
[07:35:28] <quicksilver> and then you don't have to worry about quotes.
[07:35:48] <VasiqMz> Aquaguy is it because of a form within a modal
[07:36:46] <VasiqMz> because my function gets executed just the submit handler function doesn't execute
[07:37:51] <Aquaguy> VasiqMz when submiting a form if you dont prevent the default behaviour no matter where it is, it will call the action="foo.script" as soon as its submmited, if left blank I think it calls the same page you are in.
[07:43:44] <VasiqMz> Aquaguy it doesn't help, i mean, when I use preventDefault() it still does the same thing
[07:44:11] <VasiqMz> and putting a action attribute directly goes to the page after clicking submit
[07:47:38] <VasiqMz> any help?
[07:57:33] <BillCriswell> VasiqMz: Can you ask again? Got here late I think.
[08:00:25] <lduros> should I use this: $('#myinput').keyup(function () { /* do something */ }); or: $('#myinput').bind("focus", function (e) {  $(this).keyup(/* the code */); $(this).blur(function () { /(* do unbind stuff here for keyup */ });
[08:00:34] <VasiqMz> I've created one form inside a Jquery Dialog UI which is then linked to the ajax code in the back but when i click on the submit button, the Dialog disappears and i my parent page is shown
[08:00:54] <lduros> my question is: should I leave a listener for keyup all the time for an input, or use focus/blur to add remove the keyup listener
[08:01:52] <VasiqMz> BillCriswell i'm not able to figure out the problem
[08:01:53] <BillCriswell> lduros: I'd just use keyup.
[08:01:56] <Mento> Guys, any idea how can i animate this? http://i46.tinypic.com/34r6nbs.jpg - on page load it should start on 0 and count up until the number that has been given, in this case 2147, with a nice sliding up effect
[08:02:14] <lduros> BillCriswell: what if there are many inputs? use on and delegate?
[08:03:08] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you can do that.. $('.some-class').on('keyup', funciton(e){ /* Party Time */ });
[08:04:18] <pachet> $('#parent').on('keyup.mynamespace', '.child-class', handler)
[08:04:21] <lathan> just don't do $('...').blur(function(){ alert('you stuck in an alert loop!!!!');});
[08:04:39] <BillCriswell> VasiqMz: Do you have some code I can look at? Is the form in the DOM yet before you try to turn it into an ajax form?
[08:12:55] <flaggy> hello. I have altered stuff in my DOM tree and I'd like to reload all rules that might make a connection to a click event. Is there an easy way to do it? Or do I need to keep track of all times I use the construct $(...).on(...) ?
[08:13:26] <Clex> flaggy: make a separate function to do that.
[08:13:33] <Clex> That you can call whenever you want to.
[08:13:36] <definitive> I have a horizontal carousel/slider which contains 3 elements. Copy + Image + Text scroller/carousel. My problem is that I can't find any plugin which would work with another carousel inside of it. Can you guys recommend me something?
[08:15:18] <flaggy> Clex: I see, a function that creates all connections.
[08:15:48] <Clex> flaggy: yup, I don't thinks there
[08:15:54] <Clex> 's a "magic" way to do it.
[08:16:06] <pachet> can you elaborate on 'connections'?
[08:16:11] <pachet> does that mean 'event listeners'?
[08:16:25] <definitive> basically, i need a carousel which works inside another carousel - call it 'carousception'.
[08:16:42] <definitive> Clex: you're a jquery rockstar, any ideas?
[08:18:22] <Clex> definitive: if you can "carouselify" a div, why not having a carousel of divs?
[08:18:32] <Clex> Which are individually carouselified.
[08:20:07] <BillCriswell> Mento: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDKJD/ should maybe help a bit? I don't mess with animate too much though but I feel like this should be the basic idea?
[08:21:43] <BillCriswell> I have no idea why the orange bar is getting all glitchy ( here in Chrome ).
[08:21:56] <definitive> Clex: I don't think I quite understand what you mean. Could you be a bit more explicit please? Thanks
[08:24:13] <Clex> definitive: I really don't see the problem.
[08:24:32] <Clex> Do exactly what you did for your first carousel but for each elements of the first carousel.
[08:25:32] <BillCriswell> Mento: http://jsfiddle.net/ZDKJD/1/ might be a little easier figuring out the math using bottom instead of top.
[08:26:00] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm looking for a proper calendar where dates can be selected (have a class) from being unavailable.
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> How would I prevent the orange bar from leaving those ugly lines behind? http://jsfiddle.net/ZDKJD/1/
[08:30:14] <pachet> which lines are those?
[08:30:25] <BillCriswell> pachet: Thinking it might be a chrome only thing.
[08:30:32] <BillCriswell> Google right after I asked lol
[08:35:59] <Mento> BillCriswell thanks
[08:36:26] <Mento> BillCriswell this is a nice way to start with, thanks
[08:38:53] <BillCriswell> Mento: No problem at all.

[08:49:30] <se1fi> more like $('meta').attr('content', 'text/html; charset=<ur charset>')
[08:51:14] <se1fi> oh, ok, there are more metas on the page, so...
[08:52:00] <MaxymiserTE> I created a new div on the left side of my page, and would like to move the contents of another div  to the new one. Is this possible in jquery?

[08:58:33] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm looking for a proper calendar where dates can be selected (have a class)as  being unavailable.
[08:58:38] <xckpd7> question: I'm currently using jQuery to request some jsonp and I'm doing some simple looping over it
[08:58:49] <xckpd7> how hard would it be for me to do it with vanilla js?
[08:59:12] <VasiqMz> http://jsfiddle.net/CUKqv/6/
[08:59:29] <VasiqMz> the complete function is not executed.. any help on this
[08:59:37] <se1fi> sunbeam: jquery ui?
[09:05:43] <se1fi> VasiqMz: what is that checkPassword function?
[09:09:06] <se1fi> VasiqMz: you have a submit event defined in html form and submit in js, but the function you referencing in the form doesn't exist at all
[09:11:08] <jedimind> building adaptive grid structures is breaking my brain
[09:13:19] <pachet> much fear i sense in you
[09:14:05] <lindsayo> Can someone help me figure out this parseInt? I'm not sure I've built it right.
[09:14:45] <se1fi> bring it on
[09:14:46] <MaxymiserTE> I am trying to copy over a link inside a cart from one column and insert it below the description instead. http://jsfiddle.net/Cvc7C/
[09:14:55] <lindsayo> http://pastebin.com/nxDJyeTd
[09:15:00] <MaxymiserTE> is that code good for my loop? i can't seem to get the loop good
[09:15:17] <lindsayo> MaxymiserTE: that's for my summing.
[09:15:36] <lindsayo> Trying to get the rels from everything with class 'type' and add them together.
[09:15:56] <MaxymiserTE> ?
[09:16:44] <MaxymiserTE> thats not helping the looping through my each function
[09:17:03] <pachet> var $items = $('#calendar-summary .day-wrapper.sunday .type'), total = 0; $items.each(function(){ total+= parseInt(this.attr('rel'), 10); }; alert(total);
[09:17:06] <pachet> lindsayo^
[09:17:32] <lindsayo> pachet, thanks, I'll paw through that.
[09:22:23] <MaxymiserTE> WHy is my each function not working properly?
[09:22:24] <MaxymiserTE> http://jsfiddle.net/Cvc7C/
[09:22:40] <MaxymiserTE> its moving the first and third and skipping the second
[09:22:55] <lindsayo> pachet: Firebug tells me:
[09:22:56] <lindsayo> TypeError: this.attr is not a function
[09:22:56] <lindsayo> $items.each(function(){ total+= parseInt(this.attr('rel'), 10); });
[09:23:11] <pachet> oh my b

[09:23:38] <pachet> <obligatory monday morning excuse here>
[09:25:10] <StayInSkool> hey dudes! a question. I have some custom code for dragging (i'm aware of jquery-ui's draggables; this is a DOM learning project), and I'm having the issue: if I move the cursor too fast or outside the bounds of the document window, dragging stops. it seems like the element loses 'focus' and perhaps other elements around it are now given priority as far as events go.
[09:25:25] <StayInSkool> is this why jquery-ui makes a clone of the object and places it outside of the context of the original element's parent?
[09:25:30] <lindsayo> pachet, I think we're almost there, but another FB error
[09:25:32] <xckpd7> what's the best way to escape a bunch of javascript?
[09:25:39] <lindsayo> pachet: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[09:25:39] <lindsayo> $items.each(function(){ total+= parseInt$(this).attr('rel'), 10); });
[09:25:43] <MaxymiserTE> I'm trying to move the remove button on this page from quantity to product column
[09:25:53] <lindsayo> pachet, it's pointing to the 10)
[09:25:57] <lindsayo> what is the 10 for?
[09:26:01] <MaxymiserTE> And its not looping through each properly
[09:26:06] <MaxymiserTE> it seems broken
[09:26:16] <pachet> lindsayo: you're missing a start (
[09:26:22] <pachet> parseInt($
[09:26:33] <deed02392> hey guys, how do you access the object that triggered a bound blur event?
[09:27:01] <deed02392> would it be 'this' within the specified blur function?
[09:27:04] <MaxymiserTE> http://dev3.maxymiser.com/index.php?route=checkout/cart
[09:27:15] <lindsayo> pachet: $items.each(function(){ total+= parseInt$(this).attr('rel'), (10); })
[09:27:15] <lindsayo> ?
[09:28:11] <pachet> $.items.each(function ( ) { total += parseInt( $(this).attr('rel'), 10 ); });
[09:28:38] <lindsayo> oooh
[09:28:46] <lindsayo> telling it what to parseInt
[09:31:31] <lindsayo> pachet, weird, it almost works.
[09:31:32] <lindsayo> It returns 9
[09:31:36] <lindsayo> when the total is 10.5
[09:31:51] <pachet> how could you get 10.5 when you're grabbing integers
[09:32:01] <lindsayo> ah, that must be it.
[09:32:05] <lindsayo> some of these are decimals.
[09:32:11] <lindsayo> do I use parseFloat instead?
[09:33:09] <pachet> sounds like what you want, yeah :]
[09:33:57] <lindsayo> woot!
[09:34:00] <lindsayo> pachet++
[09:34:01] <lindsayo> thank you!!
[09:34:38] <pachet> yw!
[09:35:18] <Nivery> ker
[09:35:20] <lindsayo> pachet, what's the 10 for?
[09:35:49] <se1fi> 10 is for decimal
[09:36:36] <deed02392> I've got a bunch of elements with ids like: 'foo_0', 'foo_1' etc, how can I select all of these? I have tried: (id^="foo_"), which looks like it should work according to docs
[09:36:49] <Nivery> prob need #
[09:37:21] <pachet> lindsayo: what se1fi said. the technical term is 'radix'. it lets you specify the base that you're using to derive a number
[09:37:32] <deed02392> oops, I used () instead of []
[09:37:34] <pachet> ?eval parseInt('12345', 8)
[09:37:37] <bot-t> pachet: 5349
[09:38:25] <lindsayo> oh that's supercool.
[09:38:29] <lindsayo> so you could do it in hex?
[09:38:42] <pachet> yep
[09:39:10] <deed02392> also, if I use the .blur() method against an object multiple times, does this matter, or does it just simply overwrite the last bound function to the blur event?
[09:41:00] <pachet> ?eval [(255).toString(16), parseInt('FF', 16)] @ lindsayo
[09:41:01] <bot-t> lindsayo: ["ff", 255]
[09:41:44] <lindsayo> ooo, so you could do cool things with colors
[09:42:57] <LordThumper> Hi, when would Chrome show the loading icons during Ajax? Is it when it is synchronous?
[09:44:13] <StayInSkool> synchronous AJAX? O_o
[09:44:45] <pachet> deed02392: each time you call that, you're binding a new handler to that event, and all the previous ones will fire as well
[09:44:58] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: while a request is pending completion, usually
[09:45:06] <pachet> deed02392: to combat that, use .off('blur') or .off('blur.somenamespace')
[09:45:13] <deed02392> Damn pachet, I definitely don't want that.
[09:45:28] <deed02392> Ah interesting, thanks for the tip
[09:45:52] <deed02392> that won't complain if it doesn't already have a bind event bound will it?
[09:46:13] <deed02392> a blur event* rather
[09:46:53] <pachet> right, it just won't have any effect
[09:47:04] <deed02392> great!
[09:47:45] <ztroy> lun. août 20 20:47:44 CEST 2012
[09:47:57] <pachet> i'd say
[09:48:36] <deed02392> i'd like to explain exactly what I'm doing and get some thoughts on it but I may as well just do it and then hopefully someone here wouldn't mind reviewing it and giving an opinion
[09:48:38] <deed02392> probably quicker
[09:49:22] <pachet> deed02392: sounds good
[09:50:49] <JeffreyLevesque> how do i get the height of the entire browser (including the area I scroll down).. $(document).height(), and $('body').height() haven't been successful
[09:51:50] <pachet> hrm.. unsuccessful in what browser?
[09:52:04] <pachet> JeffreyLevesque: $(document).height() works for me
[09:52:49] <JeffreyLevesque> i have an image that is a simple gradient, that I'm overlaying with a higher z-index over the entire document.  But it doesn't span the entire height
[09:53:28] <JeffreyLevesque> i used var oHeight=$(document).height(); then assigned the overlay image the same height as oHeight
[09:53:34] <JeffreyLevesque> and it doesn't go all the way down
[09:56:18] <pachet> em, could it be that you're measuring the document height before the page is finished loading completely? eg, reflows adding to page height afterwards?
[09:57:02] <JeffreyLevesque> ya maybe
[09:57:18] <JeffreyLevesque> I'm using twitter bootstrap for responsive design
[09:57:20] <JeffreyLevesque> so maybe?
[09:57:21] <se1fi> pachet: how long have you been using jquery and js?
[09:59:33] <pachet> oh gosh, not sure
[09:59:42] <pachet> i remember fiddling with simple scripts and stuff in high school
[09:59:51] <pachet> i think i started using jquery at 1.2
[10:00:56] <se1fi> nice
[10:01:34] <se1fi> I wish I had that experince
[10:01:34] <lindsayo> argh, so close.
[10:01:38] <lindsayo> the addition is working.
[10:02:29] <lindsayo> Now I have to figure out how to effect the height of each of the rows.
[10:02:34] <monk12> hello all, i'd like to figure out in small amount of jquery code if Im going forward or backward in the source when i compare 2 jquery elements ... Some example code is shown here: http://jsfiddle.net/QguZL/ its giving the wrong result for :eq(3). It should say 'Going Backwards'.
[10:06:32] <sunbeam> Hi, I'm looking for a proper calendar where dates can be selected (have a class)as  being unavailable.
[10:06:37] <sunbeam> i dont need jquery ui datepicker
[10:09:31] <se1fi> sunbeam: I haven't used those, but over 10 sec in google: jMonthCalendar, FullCalendar, iCal-like Calendar
[10:10:23] <lindsayo> okay, just a little more help on this, por favor. I can't quite get each div its own assigned height.
[10:11:05] <lindsayo> http://pastebin.com/iEvNh7Nz
[10:11:18] <lindsayo> at the bottom I have the height assignment, but it doesn't work.
[10:11:28] <lindsayo> instead, all the divs get the same height.
[10:12:19] <se1fi> lindsayo: have you tried .height()?
[10:12:32] <se1fi> ?.height()
[10:12:33] <bot-t> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[10:13:15] <se1fi> when called like this .height() it returns height, but when you pass something to it, it set the height
[10:13:28] <lindsayo> se1fi: I don't need to get the height, I need to set the height.
[10:13:28] <lindsayo> oh
[10:13:45] <lindsayo> .css('height', '5') works, too.
[10:13:53] <lindsayo> I think I just didn't build the each right.
[10:14:59] <se1fi> but don't you wanna try out .height(cellHeight)?
[10:15:12] <lindsayo> sure, I'll try it.
[10:15:14] <lindsayo> thanks :)
[10:15:35] <lindsayo> se1fi: same result.
[10:15:36] <se1fi> there is a little difference between height returned from .height() and css height
[10:15:37] <lindsayo> they all get the same height
[10:16:25] <pachet> lindsayo: how do you want the height calculated
[10:16:41] <pachet> as you have it now, they're all based on the same total that you get from looping in your first .each
[10:16:54] <lindsayo> that's what I'm afraid of pachet.
[10:17:01] <lindsayo> Each div has a rel with a value
[10:17:07] <lindsayo> like 2.5 or 5 or 1
[10:17:17] <lindsayo> and the whole block of them has to be 350 px high
[10:17:29] <lindsayo> so what I'm doing is saying that the height of each of them is proportionate to the whole.
[10:17:35] <pachet> oh gotcha
[10:17:36] <lindsayo> a larger rel will be taller.
[10:17:58] <lindsayo> this way if there are fewer cells, each one will rise to fill the total height proportionately based on its rel value.
[10:18:44] <AndrewB> Hey, is there some sort of complications with safari and binding to paste? If i use the following code on firefox and chrome everything works fine on the paste. however on safari it doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/E2nCK/

[10:33:42] <lindsayo> pachet, thanks.
[10:33:43] <pachet> lindsayo: i did you the disservice of rewriting your code, but that should give you the general idea
[10:33:58] <pachet> eg, sum them all first, then loop back through and assign the heights relatively

[10:35:17] <planadecu> hello
[10:35:29] <planadecu> any specialist with jquery timers?
[10:36:06] <lindsayo> pachet, I needed the guidance
[10:36:06] <planadecu> I have a small problem with delayed shows
[10:36:12] <lindsayo> I don't know how to write pretty code yet.
[10:36:35] <pachet> planadecu: ask and ye shall maybe receive
[10:37:14] <lathan> ?ask
[10:37:14] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:38:15] <planadecu> sorry, newbie here
[10:39:08] <lathan> ?np
[10:39:09] <bot-t> No Problem
[10:39:44] <planadecu> I have a calendar, at every day I attach an event, onhover -> mouseover: $(some_div).show(300), mouseout: $(some_div).hide(). The problem is when i pas the mouse too fast, when I change date in less than 300ms then the divs keep poping up for X*300ms being X the number of days I passed over
[10:40:20] <lathan> planadecu, have you tried jquery's hover function? see ?hover
[10:40:21] <bot-t> planadecu, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[10:40:27] <planadecu> what I'd like to do is to kill the previous timer, when I start a new one, I supose *show(delay)* starts up a timer
[10:40:49] <lathan> planadecu, that combined with see ?clearQueue
[10:40:49] <bot-t> planadecu, .clearQueue([queueName]): Remove from the queue all items that have not yet been run. http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/
[10:41:07] <planadecu> let me check that queue thing up
[10:41:20] <lathan> planadecu, basically it forces all the queued items to finish
[10:41:34] <lathan> planadecu, if you don't specify the queue name it works for the animation queue
[10:41:43] <pachet> monk12: late response, but : jsfiddle.net/uq6wB/
[10:42:35] <monk12> hey pachet, cool I'll take a look in a sec. i tried another way as well thats prob more ghetto: http://jsfiddle.net/QguZL/2/
[10:42:44] <monk12> ^looping with .each
[10:43:24] <monk12> pachet,  wow, yours is shorter :).
[10:43:42] <planadecu> lathan, and how does it work, there is an animation queue per dom element u animate ?
[10:43:50] <lathan> monk12, pachet short and concice comes with time
[10:43:56] <lathan> planadecu, there is one animation queue per page
[10:44:32] <pachet> monk12: it's not dramatically shorter than what you had originally
[10:44:33] <monk12> pachet, gotcha. I guess my version doesn't look through all nodes when matching 'is(' is found.
[10:45:07] <monk12> but mine didn't work :). yours does what i wanted to do... but at a cost of looping through all nodes.
[10:45:31] <monk12> (but my newer code looks ugly hehe. so not sure which one to pick)
[10:45:54] <lathan> monk12, then you just try to reduce the nodes you have to look for with the selector (now I don't know your question, so that may not be possible)
[10:46:17] <planadecu> lathan, why isn¡t it static then
[10:46:17] <planadecu> ?
[10:46:20] <pachet> monk12: you can always just check the indices of those elements within the set, and then compare them
[10:46:23] <pachet> no looping required there :D
[10:46:32] <planadecu> lathan, cant do $.clearQueue()
[10:47:09] <lathan> ?index @ lathan
[10:47:10] <bot-t> lathan, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:47:27] <planadecu> lathan, i still have problems with clearqueue, let me write a jsfiddle so u guys can check it out
[10:51:04] <lathan> pachet, monk12: indexes...: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/yXc7B/1/
[10:52:35] <pachet> ^
[10:52:55] <lathan> pachet, although, I could optimize it better myself....give me a moment
[10:56:29] <monk12> k lathan. just checked it out, cool way to do it.
[10:56:30] <pachet> lathan: you can actually just call .index() from the child
[10:57:05] <planadecu> lathan, check that out
[10:57:06] <planadecu> http://jsfiddle.net/jDn7X/
[10:57:18] <planadecu> even with clearqueue the animation has a weird behaviour
[10:57:39] <planadecu> lathan, blue squares are without clearQueue, red squares are with clearQueue
[10:57:53] <lathan> pachet, okay...good...that did seem a little wrong
[10:58:34] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm trying to show an image before the browsers native form submit, not using ajax, and it seems the script halts before the image loads
[10:59:02] <lathan> monk12, pachet: so the cleaner way is: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/yXc7B/2/
[11:00:12] <lathan> ?queue @ lathan
[11:00:12] <tman> i was wondering if it's possible to add style information to a class such that when newly created/inserted DOM elements happen through jquery they will inherit those styles
[11:00:12] <bot-t> lathan, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[11:00:23] <monk12> cool pachet/lathan. learned some new stuff. I'll prob use the last one.
[11:00:35] <pachet> monk12: yeah, lathan's last one is the way to go :]
[11:00:44] <lathan> planadecu, ahah...see ?stop
[11:00:45] <bot-t> planadecu, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[11:01:14] <lathan> planadecu, or maybe not...
[11:01:18] <lathan> planadecu, what are you trying to do?
[11:01:35] <planadecu> just showing a different popup at every cell
[11:01:36] <lathan> planadecu, you would be better off with some type of tooltip plugin that follows the mouse and updates the value based on what you hover
[11:02:03] <planadecu> maybe it'd be better but I thought it was as simple as so
[11:03:10] <pachet> tman: you can, but it gets pretty ugly
[11:03:42] <pachet> when i'm doing something like that i tend to just store props on objects
[11:03:50] <pachet> and then pass them into .css() for the new element
[11:05:02] <pachet> eg: var stored_styles = { some_class : { height : 20, background : '#F00' } }, some_object = $('<div/>').css(stored_styles.some_class)
[11:06:36] <planadecu> lathan, thanks for the tips
[11:06:50] <planadecu> lathan, just opened a stackoverflow question if interested: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12042742/clear-queue-in-jquery-doesnt-work-for-delayed-show-hide-on-hover
[11:06:58] <lathan> planadecu, try this first: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/jDn7X/1/
[11:07:39] <lathan> planadecu, include your fiddle in that question
[11:07:51] <fork[you]> moin.
[11:08:02] <fork[you]> is there a way to select the element that the mouse has focus on ?
[11:08:09] <planadecu> lathan, it's included, i'm checking your solution
[11:08:24] <lathan> planadecu, its a slightly different style for the tooltip...but I think its better
[11:09:20] <pachet> fork[you]: $(document.activeElement) should give you the currently *focused* element
[11:09:29] <pachet> which is a little different than what the mouse is currently over
[11:09:51] <pachet> it's a bit complicated, since your mouse is actually over a number of nested elements, so..
[11:10:09] <lathan> pachet, fork[you] .one('mousemove', function(e){ e.pageY, e.pageX })
[11:10:14] <lathan> a bit rough ...^
[11:12:19] <lathan> fork[you], its probably better to do $().on('mouseenter', 'form *', function(e){...})
[11:12:28] <lathan> than constantly keep track of the mouse
[11:12:32] <RandalSchwartz> "form before function" :)
[11:12:41] <lathan> lol
[11:12:49] <lathan> but there was a * in between....
[11:12:52] <lathan> so anything could happen
[11:13:06] <RandalSchwartz> like "before" :)
[11:14:10] <lathan> RandalSchwartz, if you'd prefer :P I could do it this way: $().mouseenter(function(e){ if($(e.target).closest('form').length){.... })
[11:14:17] <lathan> "form follows function"
[11:27:43] <walidvb> Hi guys, I'm setting up a website based on jquery cycle, but i have some issues with the width. I want the cycle to be ran on a div that is 95% of the window. so basically, all divs are in %-age
[11:27:59] <walidvb> i'm a bit stuck, here.
[11:28:17] <lathan> walidvb, are you sure you want that 95%? a 50-100 pixel margin would be so much easier...
[11:28:25] <tesmar> http://www.athenians.info/stories/jesus-drove-a-honda-but-didn-t-talk-about-it
[11:28:26] <tesmar> lol
[11:28:55] <walidvb> lathan: it's not so much about 95, but more that it should be almost full window
[11:29:14] <lathan> walidvb, then a margin probably is best
[11:29:20] <lathan> walidvb, do you have a demo?
[11:29:45] <walidvb> lathan: you can have a look at http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[11:29:46] <cordoval> hi guys
[11:29:53] <walidvb> lathan: would love to have your insight
[11:29:54] <walidvb> :)
[11:29:54] <lathan> ?hi
[11:29:55] <bot-t> Hey lathan
[11:30:18] <cordoval> I am trying to do $(this).parent().find('.icon-ok').?? to find an element and refresh it to make the IE8 nightmare display it
[11:30:21] <cordoval> how to do it?
[11:30:44] <niix> can anyone see why full calendar is giving me events 4 hours off? i.e. console is printing 12 when it should be 8 etc.. http://dpaste.com/789195/
[11:30:56] <lathan> niix, just a guess, but timezone wrong?
[11:31:21] <lathan> walidvb, you have this javascript changing it to fit on screen resize/
[11:31:37] <walidvb> lathan: ftm, yes,
[11:32:08] <walidvb> lathan: i haven't found the right solution yet
[11:32:18] <walidvb> server will serve images the size I want
[11:32:48] <niix> lathan: how do I update timezone?
[11:32:55] <lathan> walidvb, drupal is making the cycle call?
[11:33:00] <lathan> niix I don't know
[11:33:22] <cordoval>  $frame.height($frame.height() + 1);  // re-renders control
[11:33:24] <cordoval>     $frame.height($frame.height() -1);   // resets to original height
[11:33:26] <cordoval> this seems like it
[11:33:28] <lathan> niix, it should be using the client computer's time
[11:33:28] <walidvb> lathan: nope, custom
[11:33:34] <cordoval> but hmm i guess i need to find the element first
[11:33:38] <lathan> walidvb, can you fiddle it?
[11:33:44] <walidvb> sure, did already
[11:33:46] <niix> lathan: it's not :-[
[11:34:06] <lathan> niix: idk...I haven't worked with that fullcalendar plugin
[11:34:18] <lathan> walidvb, would you mind posting it for me?
[11:34:19] <lathan> lol
[11:34:28] <walidvb> lathan: sry
[11:34:46] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/UZYmf/
[11:35:01] <walidvb> lathan: that's the original fiddle, now i changed a couple of things in my site
[11:35:06] <walidvb> but idea is the same.
[11:35:07] <freazy> hi, is there a tool for safari where i can manipulate the css, how in firebug?
[11:35:19] <walidvb> freazy: enable dev tools
[11:35:20] <yen_> any idea why this site http://goo.gl/4mm8q does not load in IE. Apparently it's the ad script.
[11:35:48] <yen_> also, why does IE suck?! lol.
[11:35:52] <freazy> i have but how can i manipulate the css?
[11:36:21] <niix> lathan: it's so strange because it displays the time as 9am on the object, but I when I post it it's 4 hours later :-\
[11:36:24] <walidvb> freazy: right click -> inspect element
[11:37:59] <lathan> idk niix
[11:38:11] <freazy> ok nice :), now i can manipulate the html
[11:38:55] <freazy> but the css is stativ
[11:39:02] <freazy> cant change the attributes
[11:40:59] <freazy> oh i found it
[11:41:03] <freazy> thank u
[11:41:46] <yen_> walidvb any thoughts?
[11:42:00] <walidvb> yen_: on..?
[11:42:10] <yen_> lol, sorry  any idea why this site http://goo.gl/4mm8q does not load in IE. Apparently it's the ad script.
[11:42:45] <walidvb> yen_: not really
[11:43:00] <yen_> what's the best channel to discuss this?
[11:43:03] <walidvb> lathan: do you have any suggestion on how to get this to work?
[11:43:13] <yen_> ahh..thanks!
[11:43:25] <yen_> IE is such a pain in the butt
[11:43:31] <yen_> as everyone knows!
[11:44:16] <cordoval> gah
[11:44:18] <cordoval> it does not work
[11:44:35] <cordoval> the resizing, anything in jquery can make the browser think twice to rerender that part of the dom?
[11:45:04] <yen_> cordoval are you speaking to moi?
[11:45:18] <cordoval> yes
[11:45:24] <cordoval> and to all really
[11:45:32] <yen_> yeah it loads for like 2 secs and that's it.
[11:45:38] <yen_> I just don't get it
[11:45:42] <lathan> idk walidvb, sorry....I hate 100%'s
[11:45:47] <lathan> never can get them to work well
[11:45:50] <yen_> 100%;s?
[11:46:10] <yen_> lathan i don't care either but it won't ;oad at all in IE
[11:46:15] <monk12> cordoval, so what you doing with frames?
[11:46:16] <yen_> i need to at least get it to appear.
[11:46:23] <lathan> yen_, I tagged walidvb, not you
[11:46:24] <monk12> setting a frames height?
[11:46:26] <cordoval> monk12:
[11:46:34] <cordoval> no it i sjust to refresh
[11:46:37] <cordoval> and it is not a framew
[11:46:51] <cordoval> it is a <a class="icon-ok"
[11:47:02] <yen_> lathan i know but i thought he was refering to my problem, no?
[11:47:11] <monk12>  cordoval, Do you have a jsfiddle example up?
[11:47:16] <cordoval> but it is initially hidden in a form, then i click a button and the form displays but the icon does not
[11:47:19] <monk12> or an example somewhere of whats going on.
[11:47:20] <cordoval> not quite
[11:47:20] <lathan> yen_, I was answering his original question
[11:47:23] <cordoval> no
[11:47:27] <lathan> yen_, or....giving up on it
[11:47:33] <yen_> lol ok.
[11:47:37] <yen_> sorry for the confusion.
[11:47:39] <walidvb> lathan: i don't necessarily need 100%, but the idea is to have the cycle to keep the size of the window
[11:47:47] <cordoval> i wondering how to make it so the browser can refresh
[11:47:50] <cordoval> that part
[11:47:55] <cordoval> or recalculate the css
[11:47:59] <cordoval> and make things striaght
[11:48:02] <lathan> walidvb, and unless you give it an exact width, cycle does auto and tries to figure out the size of its content
[11:48:08] <angrywombat> alright so i have some not-ideal-at-all html generated and i need helping tranversing a table, looking for spans with class sku_count.. here's the generated html http://pastebin.com/A4qgq5fG ... can anyone help?
[11:48:21] <walidvb> lathan: so basically i should lock the window size
[11:48:31] <lathan> walidvb, probably
[11:48:41] <cordoval> :(
[11:48:42] <walidvb> lathan: or destroy and reinitialise the cycle on window.resize
[11:48:52] <lathan> ouch
[11:48:57] <walidvb> lathan: haha
[11:49:02] <yen_> walidvb where can i get an answer to the IE issue?
[11:49:05] <lathan> so destructive...
[11:49:07] <walidvb> lathan: i don't like either solution
[11:49:20] <walidvb> yen_: idk, never tried to have stuff work on IE
[11:49:34] <yen_> lathan any thoughts?
[11:49:36] <lathan> ^hate it
[11:49:45] <yen_> ugh, me too lathan
[11:49:49] <lathan> yen_, what's your link again?
[11:49:54] <monk12>  cordoval, Don't you already have css rule for that thing that gets a#icon-ok that gets unhidden on your form [not sure if thats what happens, or something else gets unhidden]?
[11:50:08] <yen_> lathan:  http://goo.gl/4mm8q does not load in IE. Apparently it's the ad script.
[11:50:19] <cordoval> i already do the jquery removing ('hidden)
[11:50:32] <lathan> yen_, what versions?
[11:50:33] <cordoval> but the problem is a problem with :before on ie8
[11:50:47] <yen_> all of htem lathan
[11:50:52] <yen_> but esp the latest 2
[11:51:03] <lathan> well I'll try 8 and 9
[11:51:07] <cordoval> if i grab the window of the browser and stretch a bit it rerenders it
[11:51:12] <cordoval> and everything shows up
[11:51:17] <yen_> cordoval u talking to me?
[11:51:22] <yen_> lathan thank
[11:51:22] <cordoval> but i need a way to do it from within js, to refresh the element icon
[11:51:23] <yen_> s
[11:51:30] <walidvb> lathan: but whatever happens, I need to serve big size images, and resize them via jQuery for them to fit the window, right? THEN run cycle on images_with_size_set
[11:51:32] <cordoval> any ideas how to do thi sthen?
[11:51:54] <yen_> lathan IE 8 and 9 is definitely the best ones to go for.
[11:52:03] <lathan> walidvb, you could load them, but hide them off the top of the page....then the sizes would compute
[11:52:06] <monk12> So instead of a css rule for :before, have you tried movin the :before rule into jquery selector that sets the css?
[11:52:13] <monk12> cordoval, ^
[11:52:39] <walidvb> lathan: why hide them?
[11:53:00] <lathan> walidvb, because if you narrow your page right now you can see all the images...
[11:53:12] <cordoval> monk12: the css is font-awesome.css css
[11:53:23] <jedimind> can i use .add with .find?
[11:53:31] <tw2113> .find().add ?
[11:53:33] <cordoval> monk12: the js is just showing a form when i click on pencil
[11:53:37] <tw2113> basic chaining
[11:53:39] <jedimind> well
[11:53:41] <cordoval> form has the icon
[11:53:48] <jedimind> will that append more items to whatever find returns?
[11:53:49] <cordoval> icon is icon-ok from font-awesome
[11:53:50] <jedimind> or will it go through find
[11:54:08] <tw2113> think about it like you were reading words
[11:54:11] <tw2113> left to right
[11:54:18] <tw2113> first it'd find something, and then once it does, it'd add something
[11:54:24] <jedimind> yeah, thats not what i want
[11:54:40] <jedimind> i want it to do a find on a selector, also to do a find on something else as part of that, and build a singular collection
[11:54:53] <jedimind> so i want to find a selecotr, but also an element with a .data attribute
[11:54:55] <monk12> cordoval, I dont see a link. Why is knowing 'font-awesome.css' useful if I dont have a link?
[11:55:06] <monk12> maybe I missed a link somewhere
[11:55:24] <lathan> yen_, my guess is the page has some wierd redirect, because on Firefox I keep getting warnings about the page wanting to redirect
[11:55:33] <cordoval> monk12: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/38
[11:55:37] <monk12> cool.
[11:55:41] <walidvb> lathan: that's because of an ugly trick I did, of replacing the actual images by <div background-image="url"/>
[11:55:43] <cordoval> but it is not it, it is related though
[11:55:55] <yen_> on firefox?
[11:56:05] <lathan> walidvb, then just do background-repeat: none
[11:56:05] <yen_> it's a shrunken url
[11:56:10] <lathan> yen_, yep
[11:56:11] <cordoval> it works on ie8 but as static, not on having a hidden->show block with that icon-ok thing inside
[11:56:14] <yen_> that's why.
[11:56:16] <walidvb> lathan: but not sure if that's gonna work, because i want to be able to zoom in the images later, so not sure if the plugin accepts doing that on divs
[11:56:20] <cordoval> it seems ie8 is bad to refresh things
[11:56:23] <lathan> no...on the page it redirects to @ yen_
[11:56:35] <lathan> walidvb, no idea...
[11:56:37] <yen_> can u send me the error msg?
[11:56:42] <walidvb> lathan: so eventually I will switch back to images, with width="100%"
[11:56:42] <yen_> or what u are seeing lathan?
[11:57:13] <walidvb> lathan: thanks for looking into it. I'll come back here tmrw, maybe someone will know better. or I will hack cycle.
[11:57:25] <ikla> I have 10 input fields that change name on different pages, how can I grab these with a regexp and get the value of each one ?
[11:57:37] <lathan> yen_, its like it starts to redirect, then it gets an error about 'google' is not defined
[11:58:03] <BillCriswell> ikla: Are they in form with something common?
[11:58:12] <ikla> yes
[11:58:36] <ikla> they start all start with the same name of PLYH_xxxx
[11:59:03] <BillCriswell> $(':input[name^=PLYH]') should do the trick.
[11:59:12] <cordoval> i wonder if i can add an .animate
[11:59:14] <cordoval> or something less visible
[11:59:17] <cordoval> to have it rerender
[11:59:19] <ikla> ok that will grab all 10?
[11:59:28] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:59:32] <lathan> yen_, idk...some javascript error in some packed javascript file: http://www.google.com/cse/cse.js?cx=015703598355523603752:pakzpr5nnd8
[11:59:40] <ikla> ok, I'll play with that, thanks!
[11:59:47] <lathan> not entirely sure, but that's as far as I'm going...
[11:59:47] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:00:02] <lathan> since this is some oneelse's page, you can't even help fix something if I find it
[12:00:04] <lathan> yen_, ^
[12:00:21] <yen_> yeah looking into it lathan
[12:00:45] <monk12> cordoval, so I skimmed over this thread, they include a special stylesheet using 'IE conditional comments'. (the rule is only for IE 7 at the top post, looks like maybe it got commited but people still had problems maybe?). I also see the jquery at the bottom. Did you add that?
[12:00:47] <lathan> yen_, they got some wierd self-redirect that must be messing it up
[12:01:19] <monk12> cordoval,  like did you follow their instructions. give that ID to your script? Still have issues?
[12:01:42] <cordoval> yes if i do console.log i find the right icon element
[12:01:46] <cordoval> and there i change width or height
[12:01:50] <yen_> lathan i cant open that file :-s
[12:01:53] <cordoval> but nothing reread the css rules
[12:02:13] <lathan> yen_, idk......I'm not going to spend more time on some random advertisement webpage
[12:02:14] <yen_> can u send it via pastebin or something lathan
[12:02:25] <lathan> its packed....
[12:02:26] <monk12> when you change the width/height, do you re-set the css links href reference like the thread you gave me says?
[12:03:09] <monk12> cordoval,  The easiest thing would be to simply your problem into a jsfiddle and ask peeps while you work on fixing it yourself.
[12:03:20] <cordoval> monk12: which comment number?
[12:04:10] <monk12> cordoval, #issuecomment-6621377
[12:04:11] <yen_> lathan ok
[12:04:19] <monk12> in the link you sent. i don't see any comment #'s on the page
[12:04:40] <monk12> (but can click the comment and see href shortcut in the url)
[12:05:18] <cordoval> monk12: thanks!
[12:05:25] <cordoval> i missed that
[12:05:28] <cordoval> now i will try that
[12:05:32] <cordoval> thanks!
[12:05:47] <ikla> BillCriswell, can I do ^PLYH.*LM^   .* will cover between those
[12:06:01] <ravenzz> no
[12:06:30] <ravenzz> but you can filter the set of matched elements
[12:06:33] <BillCriswell> ikla: You can try... :input[name^=PLYH][name$=LM] maybe?
[12:06:59] <ikla> BillCriswell, they will be numbers in between
[12:07:15] <ravenzz> ?filter @ ikla
[12:07:21] <ravenzz> no bawt
[12:07:25] <ravenzz> :
[12:07:36] <monk12> cordoval, k your welcome ... Next time read the full page you give peeps :). If reading whole thread is too long... skip to bottom and go upwards as might be more recent solution as is in this case. The code stuck out so easily when i did this, not sure how you missed it.
[12:07:47] <BillCriswell> If that doesn't work go with .filter... but I don't see why that wouldn't work.
[12:07:47] <Krambiorix> hi i have a string with an emailaddress in it. How can i remove it from the string?
[12:07:48] <bot-t> ikla, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:08:12] <ravenzz> oh Am I lagged
[12:08:13] <ravenzz> ?
[12:08:21] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: Not sure.
[12:08:27] <BillCriswell> ikla: You can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/6Tav3/
[12:09:10] <BillCriswell> ikla: Not sure if using .filter would be better or whatever but both ways would work.
[12:09:42] <ravenzz> ikla go and set up a test on jsperf.com
[12:10:11] <ikla> ok, I just need to add all 8-10 fields
[12:10:33] <BillCriswell> ikla, ravenzz: The example I showed definitely works...
[12:10:48] <cordoval> monk12: I don't understand how it works hmm the function
[12:10:50] <ravenzz> ofc
[12:11:03] <ravenzz> you were talking about performance
[12:11:09] <ravenzz> "would be better"
[12:11:46] <ikla> BillCriswell, it works but how can you get both of them red?
[12:11:56] <BillCriswell> ikla: That would go against what you want.
[12:12:07] <BillCriswell> The second one doesn't match for a reason.
[12:12:27] <ikla> 10 values of each input added together
[12:12:37] <mNy`-> hello guys, i wrote a little jquery script which i could use some help with, if you want to take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/3g37F/
[12:12:38] <ikla> I can toss one up
[12:13:08] <monk12> It adds a parameter to the css src. like href="/css/font-awesome.ie7.css" becomes href="/css/font-awesome.ie7.css?reload=10234234324" and prob forces it to not use cached css file (im guess the css dynamically changes?)
[12:13:35] <monk12> just have to make sure your <link/> tag for it has that  id="font_awesome_ie7" so jquery can target it.
[12:13:37] <monk12> cordoval, ^
[12:13:43] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: Ahh... don't think performance is an issue there.
[12:14:36] <cordoval> oh
[12:14:42] <cordoval> but i am not using that css
[12:14:44] <cordoval> hmm
[12:14:55] <cordoval> i guess it will force me to load it even though i am in ie8
[12:15:48] <mNy`-> I am trying to built a dynamic menu which only always shows 5 li elements, and if there are more it should go down to 6 and hide 1
[12:15:57] <mNy`-> i posted the code i got so far on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3g37F/
[12:16:20] <ravenzz> ikla http://jsperf.com/multiple-name-attr-vs-filter
[12:16:25] <monk12> dunno cordoval. i thought you had an issue specifically with that Font-Awesome project, hence why you posted it. so thats just a generic issue you posted when you searched IE doesn't show images or something?
[12:17:21] <Norbo11> Is there a function in JQuery to check if a string ends with a certain other string?
[12:17:49] <Norbo11> Or even better - is there a way of getting the current file that the javascript is embedded on?
[12:18:38] <lathan> Norbo11, (first q) that is more of a plain javascript question. you can do a regular expression: string.match('blah-foo$')
[12:19:00] <Norbo11> ah, okay, regex is a good solution.
[12:19:03] <Norbo11> But 2nd question?
[12:19:07] <monk12> cordoval, if you make a jsfiddle with a very simple/generalized example of your problem, it would have helped me out figure out issue. Otherwise Im just guessing how that link relates to your problem. Sorry, gotta head back to work.
[12:20:31] <mNy`-> Someone maybe got a minute for me? I bet my problem is just a quick look for you guys
[12:20:42] <ak> what do you need mNy`-
[12:20:54] <mNy`-> I am trying to built a dynamic menu which only always shows 5 li elements, and if there are more it should go down to 6 and hide 1
[12:21:00] <mNy`-> http://jsfiddle.net/3g37F/
[12:21:08] <mNy`-> this is what i came up with so far
[12:21:24] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: Dammmnnn.
[12:21:53] <ravenzz> :o?
[12:22:22] <BillCriswell> Just shocked at the results.
[12:22:34] <ak> mNy`-: looks good for a start :)
[12:22:34] <lathan> Norbo11, there is no good way to do that....all the "solutions" are just hacks looking at the script tags
[12:22:43] <nerk> I am using $.load() on a pagefragment .. eg./ url #divID, the problem with this is that included javascripts do not load.  so I am extracting them from the content with filter() but am getting all scripts.  anyways, so I gave scripts I don't want to load a class of headscript and run this against this against the array of script tags. http://jsfiddle.net/yR9Xm/
[12:22:51] <nerk> anyone see an issue with that loadScripts method
[12:22:53] <nerk> ?
[12:22:53] <mNy`-> ak, well i dont know how to go on tho :P
[12:23:05] <mNy`-> ak any suggestions/tips?
[12:23:06] <cordoval> monk12: now it works but
[12:23:11] <BillCriswell> I figured the way I came up with would be slower but not by that much.. not that it's a huge difference but still.
[12:23:20] <ak> i'm looking at it at the moment :)
[12:23:27] <mNy`-> thank you so much
[12:23:53] <cordoval> there are several fields, so when i click on one pencil for the first time it does not show, for the following, the x and check show for the previous ones
[12:23:59] <cordoval> so it is refreshing the css
[12:24:24] <ravenzz> BillCriswell eh the thing is that :input is a pseudo selctor
[12:24:35] <ravenzz> so I guess that the selection is more heavy
[12:24:52] <BillCriswell> I got different results the second time. The $('input') one won.
[12:24:53] <ravenzz> than a regular getElementsByTagName
[12:25:02] <BillCriswell> The first time I ran it filter() won
[12:25:44] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: That's cool. Never used this before.
[12:27:31] <ravenzz> yep it is, I use it when I have such kind of doubts on performances, but sadly I don't for big amount of code
[12:32:15] <dialman> Hm. $(document).ready(function() { alert("Test"); }); in an externally loaded .js file is never executing in FF 15 (jQuery 1.5), but $(window).load( function() { alert("Test"); }); does.
[12:32:21] <dialman> Any idea why that would be?
[12:33:00] <zsoc> I'm having some issues with simple math in .val ... i have something like $('#some_id').val(50/2);
[12:33:20] <BillCriswell> zsoc: Should have no issue there...
[12:34:27] <BillCriswell> dialman: What happens with $(function() { alert("test"); }); ?
[12:34:54] <dialman> Let me give it a try
[12:34:55] <mNy`-> ak: you got an idea?
[12:35:00] <mNy`-> or still looking at it
[12:35:04] <zsoc> ah i see what happened i think, ty
[12:35:13] <ak> hm
[12:35:15] <ak> i got some
[12:35:22] <ak> http://jsfiddle.net/QNzfN/5/
[12:35:31] <ak> some fixes needed ;)
[12:36:05] <dialman> BillCriswell: That never executes eitehr
[12:36:33] <mNy`-> ak: looks good for an idea though :)
[12:36:42] <BillCriswell> How are you loading jQuery? Are you running these tests in different parts of your page? Anything in the error log?
[12:37:40] <mNy`-> ak: im just so used to php that the syntax makes me crazy
[12:37:42] <dialman> jQuery is loaded via
[12:37:42] <dialman> <script src="/js/shared/external/jquery-1.5.js"></script>
[12:38:06] <dialman> I can see the $(document).ready entering jQuery's ready function in firebug
[12:38:50] <BillCriswell> Can you reproduce the issue at jsfiddle.net?
[12:39:22] <igcewieling> I suspect a bug in my code, but I want to make sure.  Is the correct way to set the contents of a <textarea> is with .text()?
[12:39:34] <mNy`-> ak: maybe .eq(count -1) something..
[12:39:56] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: You should use .val()
[12:41:03] <igcewieling> BillCriswell: both have the problem I'm experiencing, but I'll use .val().  Thanks!
[12:41:14] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: What's the problem?
[12:42:32] <igcewieling> the 2nd time I try setting the contents nothing is set, but it is complicated by ajax, etc.  I just wanted to make sure I was using the right way of setting the contents
[12:43:50] <mNy`-> Someone else maybe has an idea how to fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/QNzfN/5/
[12:44:56] <mNy`-> should always show 5 li elements between the two arrows, if there are more, go down to 6th and hide the 1st
[12:46:06] <ak> hmhm
[12:46:28] <mNy`-> ak: thats what im like all day haha
[12:46:39] <mNy`-> such a small script gives me a major headache
[12:46:41] <mNy`-> :D
[12:48:01] <mNy`-> probably have to count the elements and subtract one less somehow..
[12:49:12] <ak> yeah
[12:49:20] <ak> well there are a lot of ways for this...
[12:49:27] <oktora> hhhoho
[12:49:35] <ak> you could use some vertical scrolling thing, for the shiny looks
[12:49:51] <mNy`-> i dont really need the look, just clicking up and down
[12:49:53] <mNy`-> would be enough already
[12:51:23] <mNy`-> if theres any professional here this would probably just be a one minute thing
[12:52:59] <ak> well i'm getting there..
[12:53:01] <ak> :)
[12:53:01] <BillCriswell> mNy`-: I don't really get what you're asking for. When you click the down arrow you want that to turn into a 6 or what?
[12:53:13] <mNy`-> ak: <3
[12:53:14] <zsoc> (44.99/2).float.toFixed(2) <-- is there something wrong with that syntax?
[12:53:25] <mNy`-> BillCriswell: no it should just scroll down one li
[12:53:32] <mNy`-> and hide the one on top
[12:53:34] <NoiseEee> zsoc: what's "float" ?
[12:53:40] <mNy`-> scrolling through
[12:53:43] <mNy`-> by clicking
[12:53:54] <mNy`-> up or down
[12:53:57] <BillCriswell> So you want the list to be 2,3,4,5,6 after it's clicked and you want to keep the arrows there?
[12:54:04] <zsoc> oh.. i think i want parseFloat
[12:54:05] <mNy`-> yes
[12:54:22] <mNy`-> and after another click 3,4,5,6,7
[12:54:29] <mNy`-> and the opposite of course
[12:54:39] <BillCriswell> Starting at 0 or 1?
[12:54:52] <mNy`-> well doesnt really matter
[12:55:13] <mNy`-> this will be a menu with no numbers
[12:55:22] <ak> ah i got it working
[12:55:26] <ak> :P
[12:55:30] <mNy`-> u did??
[12:55:32] <Zuhai> how long do you guys think it will take to learn jquery and javascript, to a decent level where your able to code plugins and such. I allready know php/html/css, so some aspects wont be totally new to me.
[12:55:42] <BillCriswell> You have 7 in this list... is the number of list items the limit you're using?
[12:56:02] <mNy`-> no the main thing is, there should always be 5 shown
[12:56:06] <mNy`-> and the rest be hidden
[12:56:15] <mNy`-> if there are more
[12:56:41] <ak> http://jsfiddle.net/QNzfN/11/
[12:56:42] <ak> e
[12:56:44] <ak> 11 trys
[12:56:46] <ak> :D
[12:56:59] <mNy`-> ak: i love you
[12:57:05] <rgr> delimiting a document.write string with single quotes should mean it can contains double quotes just fine shouldnt it?
[12:57:22] <mNy`-> thank you so much! you saved me a sleepless night
[12:58:02] <ak> i still would make some animated slider here ;)
[12:58:19] <mNy`-> im a jquery noob...
[12:58:28] <mNy`-> for me
[12:58:28] <mNy`-> javascript is cool
[12:58:29] <mNy`-> but jquery isnt
[12:58:30] <mNy`-> lol
[12:59:30] <BillCriswell> jQuery is the only reason I know JavaScript.
[12:59:53] <mNy`-> well i just didnt have the time to really read myself into it yet
[13:00:11] <mNy`-> i have used some scripts and this was my first real try
[13:00:22] <mNy`-> still kinda hart and confusing sometimes
[13:00:27] <mNy`-> hard*
[13:04:45] <FrozenFire> Does anyone know of an existing plugin that will gracefully handle the process of progressively enhancing a horizontally-scrolled div, such that it's scrolled with directional buttons instead of a scrollbar?
[13:10:54] <ColKurtz> FrozenFire, sounds like something I would code myself tbh
[13:10:58] <ColKurtz> that, or use the scrollTo plugin
[13:11:53] <ColKurtz> but it would still necessitate scripting the progressive enhancement... use js to change the overflow:auto; or scroll to overflow:hidden;
[13:13:20] <ColKurtz> then bind the click events on your buttons to use scrollTo. I would only use scrollTo if you want it to auto-detect how far it needs to scroll to place something in view
[13:13:24] <FrozenFire> Yeah, I've been writing it myself thusfar, but there are so many edge cases for this sort of thing
[13:13:32] <FrozenFire> Especially when dealing with a resizeable container
[13:13:34] <ColKurtz> if you only need to scroll by the same number of px each time, I would just animate the scrollLeft property
[13:13:45] <ColKurtz> okay so it's resizable
[13:14:07] <ColKurtz> then try using the scrollTo plugin
[13:14:37] <ColKurtz> if you get stuck, make a jsfiddle and mention my name and I'll try and help
[13:16:45] <FrozenFire> Thanks
[13:21:08] <trond-> hi... I am using jquery to do some dragging of an image onto a canvas. I have how ever noticed that the drop point is depended on the screen resolution... Is there a way I can have more control over this?
[13:31:04] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks - in the 1.8 rewrite, did translations com along?
[13:31:15] <jonathancutrell> like:
[13:31:34] <jonathancutrell> translateY for instance?
[13:34:40] <Justus> hi, I want to use a modal dialog with custom buttons
[13:34:41] <Justus> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[13:34:58] <Justus> like in this example, my problem is, that I want to place a function call instead of a string at the position
[13:35:15] <Justus> I need it for localisation (the string is obviously different in different languages)
[13:35:27] <Justus> any ideas how to do that?
[13:49:36] <gnarf> jonathancutrell: nope - still need to cssHook those
[13:50:00] <FrozenFire> ColKurtz, Thanks on the lead to scrollTo. Definitely made the whole process easier (and more stable)
[13:50:05] <the_jeebster> hey guys, I'm a bit new to regular expressions. If I have a string '/apple?page=1', how can I replace the '?' with '.js?'
[13:50:12] <ColKurtz> good to hear FrozenFire
[13:50:39] <Heather_> need help creating an ajax request. Im trying this $.post('index.php', '?action=befriend&userfriend=' . userfriendreq); Im using a .php controller file where the statements being executed depends on the "?action='befriend" part. Both the .js file and the .php file is in the same folder. Still I cant manage to get the statements inside the php file to be executed.
[13:55:52] <Geffer> Three in the demo because the color black?
[13:56:23] <the_jeebster> anyone?
[13:56:36] <Geffer> Three in the demo because the color black?
[13:57:34] <Geffer> .siblings()
[13:58:01] <Geffer> .siblings()  Three in the demo because the color black?
[14:00:11] <Geffer> help me ?
[14:00:29] <Geffer> .siblings()  Three in the demo because the color black?
[14:01:54] <ColKurtz> Geffer, stop spamming.
[14:02:02] <Eviltwin> Geffer: We also can't help you if we don't understand the question
[14:02:06] <ColKurtz> you don't even make sense Geffer
[14:03:51] <ColKurtz> the_jeebster:
[14:03:55] <ColKurtz> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.
[14:03:59] <ColKurtz> :P
[14:04:09] <Geffer> <html>
[14:05:56] <ScottG> Is there a way to compare two arrays?
[14:06:11] <Eviltwin> Depends on the kind of comparison you're trying to make
[14:06:24] <ScottG> That they are equal?
[14:06:45] <Eviltwin> Depends on whether you want shallow or deep equality
[14:06:54] <nerk> ScottG, you could use $.inArray()
[14:07:00] <nerk> and compare each item
[14:07:10] <nerk> and set a flag to false if they don't euqal
[14:07:12] <Eviltwin> Also depends on if order matters
[14:07:29] <Geffer> see site jquery siblings () <li class="hilite"> Three </ li> because this black?
[14:07:30] <nerk> order don't matter
[14:07:33] <nerk> with inArray
[14:08:10] <ScottG> These are all good questions, but they apply to all languages. Why does almost every language have a simple array comparator either by == or a function?
[14:08:11] <Geffer> see site jquery siblings () <li class="hilite"> Three </ li> because this black?
[14:08:15] <NoiseEee> Geffer: wtf are you asking?
[14:08:23] <Eviltwin> Geffer: They all start black, what they're trying to illustrate is that an element is not its own sibling
[14:08:35] <nerk> var arrEqual = true; $.each(array1, function() { if(!$.inArray(this,array2) { arrEqual = false; break; } });
[14:08:38] <nerk> something like that
[14:09:01] <Eviltwin> nerk: Dude, you put a "break" statement outside of a loop or switch statement
[14:09:47] <nerk> irregardless, the break portion is hardly important to the sample code.
[14:09:50] <ScottG> Just seems like a lot of work to compare a pretty data structure.
[14:10:02] <Geffer> ies .siblings()
[14:10:07] <ScottG> pretty simle*
[14:10:13] <Geffer> yes ").siblings()
[14:10:24] <ScottG> simple*
[14:12:35] <knite> /join mezzanine
[14:14:42] <Eviltwin> ScottG: Can you give some example data structures? Does order matter? Can there be arrays or objects within the arrays?
[14:15:24] <PhonicUK> Is there a way of taking a selector, and working out what its style would be without having an element that uses it?
[14:16:06] <Eviltwin> PhonicUK: Not in a simple way and definitely not in older browsers
[14:16:23] <PhonicUK> Eviltwin, well don't need to support anything older than IE9
[14:16:38] <PhonicUK> backwards compatibility isn't a requirement
[14:17:17] <Eviltwin> The only way I know how is to actually read and parse the .styleSheet selectors yourself
[14:17:23] <Eviltwin> Figure out the precedence
[14:17:24] <PhonicUK> eep
[14:17:27] <Eviltwin> And calculate
[14:17:34] <PhonicUK> hmm
[14:17:42] <Eviltwin> The alternative is to create an element that matches and use getComputedStyle
[14:18:10] <PhonicUK> balls
[14:25:33] <dialman> Why is it that is one event in the callback array that is executed for document.ready functions fails, the exception causes the remainder of the events in the array to be skipped?
[14:26:41] <catcher> What's the most consistent way to pair jquery with css media queries?  I need to animate something to a different value depending on the client width, consistent with my media queries.  Should I just go with screen.width js?
[14:27:09] <Eviltwin> dialman: Because jQuery tries to avoid hiding errors wherever possible
[14:27:42] <nerk> who wanted to compare two arrays?  try this. http://jsfiddle.net/GR7GM/1/
[14:28:24] <BillCriswell> catcher: screen.width wouldn't take into account the size of the window. Best bet might be $('body').width() ?
[14:29:04] <adante> how could i turn [1,2,3] into e.g. { 1: 1, 2:4, 3:9 } ? i know i can $.map(list, function(i, x) { return x*x; } to get the values but not sure how to combine them back into an object
[14:29:36] <smallcapsdude> adante: your object[key]
[14:29:37] <Eviltwin> adante: var obj={}; $.each([1,2,3], function(i, x) { obj[x] = x * x; });
[14:29:49] <adante> possibly $.extend({}, $.map(list, function(i ,x) { return {i:x}; }) ?
[14:30:18] <adante> Eviltwin: ah yeah, i was hoping to do it in a single line expression
[14:30:28] <Eviltwin> You could make a function that does that
[14:30:34] <smallcapsdude> member:adante
[14:30:36] <Eviltwin> But I don't think there's any built-in one-liner for that
[14:31:06] <smallcapsdude> adante: magic is that you reference an object by object.property or object[property]
[14:31:46] <Eviltwin> Those are two different things unless you've done var property = 'property';
[14:32:17] <adante> smallcapsdude: i'm aware of that not sure how that gets me to translate an array to a mapper
[14:32:47] <adante> bleh anyway my $.extend(... thing works but heh, smells
[14:32:59] <Eviltwin> adante: Are you sure it works?
[14:33:02] <catcher> BillCriswell, kk, I'll check that out, but nothing that pairs them to your knowledge?
[14:33:09] <Eviltwin> Try it for like [4, 6, 8]
[14:38:24] <BillCriswell> catcher: Sorry dude. Long day.
[14:49:56] <catcher> BillCriswell, no worries :)
[15:11:45] <ryanneufeld> GREETINGS PEOPLE OF EARTH
[15:13:14] <hobs_> gheedings hunams
[15:15:45] <ryanneufeld> 👊
[15:22:50] <sunbeam> Any Kalendae.js users in here?
[15:59:48] <imsky> i know what you all did
[16:00:22] <rgr> Does someone here have a working solution to load jquery toolkits from cdn if online but from local storage if not? The (window.jQuery || document.write (script include)) method doesnt work properly and using document.write is frowned upon. I tried creating ne jquery elements and appending then to body but that also failed for a reason I wasnt able to ascertain. So, are there any standard ways of managing this?
[16:00:50] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:01:15] <hlveheart> hey guys?
[16:01:51] <hlveheart> http://pastebin.com/hwzpTbuV    ... any idea where I'm missing a ;?
[16:02:00] <hlveheart> I can't find it.
[16:02:03] <hlveheart> =|
[16:02:37] <hlveheart> unminified, it works. minified it breaks. :(
[16:02:46] <imsky> the if
[16:02:51] <imsky> if (OSTarget == "Blank") $(".OSContainer").stop(true, true).fadeOut()
[16:03:09] <imsky> also writing multiline if clauses without braces is beyond degenerate
[16:03:44] <Eviltwin> Also there's a shitton of repetetion here
[16:03:48] <pandemic> http://www.jslint.com/
[16:03:51] <pandemic> use this :)
[16:03:52] <imsky> yep, tons
[16:03:58] <imsky> it's just poorly written
[16:04:21] <hlveheart> It's quickly written for a mockup. Any tips on what to do to it?
[16:05:03] <Eviltwin> I'd probably use a ternary
[16:05:08] <imsky> lol
[16:05:19] <chovy> what's the best way to fire an event when a select option is selected?
[16:05:27] <imsky> ?change
[16:05:28] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[16:05:40] <chovy> $("select").change() ?
[16:05:46] <imsky> i dunno man
[16:05:56] <imsky> im no jquery expert
[16:05:58] <hlveheart> lol
[16:06:17] <Eviltwin> Actually is there a reason your OSTarget is WinVISTA while your id is WinVista?
[16:06:20] <chovy> thanks
[16:06:21] <Eviltwin> Etc
[16:07:10] <Eviltwin> If you can match the cases on those, you could probably just do $(".OSContainer").html(ajax_load).load('/support/downloadlocs #' + OSTarget); instead of all of the else ifs
[16:07:25] <imsky> i like how eviltwin does the work
[16:07:28] <imsky> you go buddy
[16:07:29] <Eviltwin> Oh, and the MacOSPWRPC vs MacPwrPC
[16:07:59] <hlveheart> I guess it was just sloppy.
[16:08:00] <hlveheart> :(
[16:08:04] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[16:08:06] <Eviltwin> It was
[16:08:14] <hlveheart> Sorry. Still learning jQuery myself.
[16:08:45] <Eviltwin> We accept your apology
[16:08:53] <tw2113> on one condition
[16:08:54] <Eviltwin> And direct you to see ?learn
[16:08:54] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[16:08:55] <tw2113> keep learning :P
[16:09:48] <Lucky--> anyone know of a good lib that modernizes ie6-8, not just checks for it for tags like placeholder?
[16:10:09] <hlveheart> thanks again guys
[16:10:28] <tw2113> i earnestly suggest saying "fuck IE6"
[16:10:42] <Lucky--> tw2113: ok 7-8
[16:10:46] <tw2113> unless you somehow have a lot of traffic from it, and by a lot i mean 100+
[16:10:53] <tw2113> and even that's me being generous
[16:10:55] <Lucky--> tw2113: and I *freaking* *WISH* i didnt have to
[16:11:06] <Eviltwin> Facebook deprecated IE6 this summer
[16:11:07] <Lucky--> tw2113: this is for a landing page for a lead aggregation network, so yes high traffic
[16:11:22] <tw2113> i don't mean high traffic in general
[16:11:31] <tw2113> i mean checking analytics and seeing percent of IE6 users
[16:11:39] <tw2113> :D
[16:11:43] <Lucky--> so 7-8
[16:11:52] <tw2113> other than that, define modernizing
[16:12:03] <Lucky--> manuelbieh_: i dont have to write js for my placeholders to show up
[16:12:04] <Eviltwin> He'd like to write code that only works in Chrome
[16:12:04] <Lucky--> ;-)
[16:12:07] <Eviltwin> But make it work in IE6
[16:12:10] <Lucky--> Eviltwin: oh most def
[16:12:11] <Eviltwin> Without changing anything
[16:12:28] <Lucky--> something like this: http://css3pie.com/
[16:12:30] <tw2113> "polyfill"
[16:12:30] <Lucky--> but with html5
[16:12:48] <Eviltwin> Namely he needs file system access and 3D CSS animations
[16:13:01] <Vorspire> make a clickonce app that blue screens their computer with the error "IE_SUCKS_REQ_UPGRADE"
[16:14:43] <tw2113> srsly, determine what parts you need the dinobrowsers to be able to do, and go from there
[16:15:03] <tw2113> you'd make your users suffer trying to go and find libs that fill everything
[16:15:16] <tw2113> so figure out what you need
[16:16:22] <Vorspire> damn the only places I know that actually use <=IE6 are Gov'mnt offices in the public sector and most schools... and maybe people over 50.
[16:16:29] <Eviltwin> Wait

[16:16:40] <Vorspire> <=
[16:16:52] <tw2113> IE5.5
[16:17:00] <tw2113> at least they'd still support @font-face with .eot

[16:21:26] <BFranks> If I go to the jQueryUI page, load the console, and paste in $( ".selector" ).slider( "option", "value", 37 );  .. even the demo slider ignores me.. What am I doing wrong here?
[16:22:02] <BFranks> Oh wait.. bad example command
[16:22:43] <BFranks> $( "#slider" ).slider( "option", "value", 37 ); works fine.. ;P
[17:11:05] <rgr> Is there some concept of storing elements between svreen refreshes? eg I have made a toolbar div which changes its orientatin and display modes etc based on button clicks. When I rfresh the page the resource is "newly loaded" . What would the jquery way be to maintain this element across sessions/page refreshes?
[17:13:09] <brl0> rgr, generallky state is stored in persistent storage (localstorage/cookie/server db/session)..
[17:13:54] <brl0> rgr: you can probably add a hash/query params to the url, read that on the client, and then draw the ui based on the values passed..
[17:18:06] <rgr> right... so no jquery idea / wrapper then. fiar enuff.
[17:20:32] <rgr> so what would I need to store in say a cookie? Can I serialise the element as text with all css attribuest? If so whats the best way?
[17:29:30] <coldhead> rgr: i think a better way is NOT to reload the whole page, but just reload parts of it via ajax
[17:29:43] <coldhead> and keep your state in the browser
[17:29:48] <coldhead> "live"
[17:30:05] <tw2113> welcome to jquery, coldhead, feel free to ask questions for any issues you may have
[17:30:36] <rgr> well yes, but people still press refresh..
[17:30:47] <coldhead> then all bets are off!
[17:30:53] <coldhead> they shouldn't do that :)
[17:31:22] <rgr> well theyre not if I can store the css attribute of the node. Which should be posible.
[17:31:26] <coldhead> thanks tw2113
[17:34:39] <EMonk> Quick question regarding jQuery.ui.tabs - is it possible to allow the user to select the text of the tab?  It appears that the mouse click being cancelled for further processing is preventing the selection of the tab's text.
[17:36:06] * EMonk waves
[17:36:24] <EMonk> Anybody able to help?
[17:37:50] <coldhead> EMonk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11905620/how-to-make-the-label-text-on-jquery-ui-tabs-highlightable
[17:37:59] <coldhead> looks like you can't easily do it
[17:38:17] <EMonk> Thanks coldhead - I searched but didn't find that one.  Will read up on it now.
[17:46:13] <EMonk> OK, read that and all the related content, but no answer.
[17:46:30] <coldhead> as i said, can't easily do it
[17:46:46] <coldhead> so you're either going to patch the UI code or write your own
[17:47:34] <tw2113> woo! coding!
[17:47:39] <EMonk> The problem appears to be that jQuery.ui.tabs uses links as the tab buttons, and needs to use cancelDefault to prevent the link from being actioned.
[17:47:56] <EMonk> Might have to look at rewriting the tabs funtionality then.  *sigh*
[17:48:08] <someprimetime_> just write your own tabs
[17:48:16] <rgr> lol.
[17:48:21] <someprimetime_> it's not hard and tyou don't have to import jqueryui
[17:48:24] <someprimetime_> win win
[17:48:27] <rgr> hahaha
[17:48:28] <EMonk> But I *LIKE* jQuery ui :)
[17:48:35] <rgr> What a ridiculous suggestion
[17:48:48] <someprimetime_> how so, rgr?
[17:49:13] <rgr> the whole point of jquery and jquery ui is to use them and cntribute to them and build. Not suggest "writing your own" because of a minor hiccup. That would be insane.
[17:49:17] <tw2113> just grab all the li tags and attach classes to them?
[17:49:32] <yononi> hello. what am i doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/D8Nda/ ? besides not using jquery...
[17:49:37] <tw2113> with predefined css set
[17:49:54] <someprimetime_> isn't jquery ui getting totally rewritten anyway?
[17:49:55] <tw2113> i may have to look at the tabs source
[17:49:59] <yononi> i can't see what exaclty is undefined and why it can't be converted
[17:50:09] <someprimetime_> it's a good learning project either way to write your own stuff
[17:50:15] <tw2113> isn't it needed badly someprimetime_ ?
[17:50:23] <EMonk> Sorry someprimetime_ but your suggestion is frivolous.  I'm using jQuery.ui extensively, and I came here looking for a solution that didn't require a complete reimplementation.
[17:50:59] <someprimetime_> you're using jquery.ui extensively with the tabs or other portions of it?
[17:51:03] <EMonk> I *CAN* write the code, but it seemed like this is a common enough - and simple enough - issue that it might have been addressed already.
[17:51:28] <innociv> How do I see what order <tag id="#what-order-am-i" class="out-of-these" /> out of all .out-of-these?
[17:51:41] <innociv> index, sorry
[17:51:41] <jaket> use javascript
[17:51:42] <EMonk> Tabs, draggable, sizable, buttons, Accordian, DatePicker... lots of stuff
[17:51:51] <imsky> i need a drink
[17:52:59] <EMonk> I guess I'll submit a bug when the tracker comes back up.
[17:53:05] <someprimetime_> i'd still use draggable, sizable, accordian, datepicker since they handle a lot of crap i wouldn't want to re-write, but i ended up writing my own tabs plugin just because the jquery ui one wasn't what i was looking for
[17:53:32] <someprimetime_> i'd use jquery draggable any day over html5 drag/drop
[17:53:34] <coldhead> innociv: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[17:53:46] <someprimetime_> but that's besides the point.
[17:53:58] <innociv> yeah i see. $('.out-of-these').index('#what-index-am-i');
[17:54:47] <yononi> i have no idea what i'm doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/D8Nda/
[17:55:31] <coldhead> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/137/5c4.jpg
[17:55:36] <EMonk> @someprimetime_ : if we don't feed back into the primary project, it doesn't get improved.  Better to adapt and extend than reimplement, from that perspective.
[17:56:38] <ajpiano> why would you need the text of your tabs to be selectable
[18:00:16] <EMonk> @ajpiano The tab contents show notes for members in our database, with the text of the tabs being the ID of the member.  My users want to be able to copy and paste the MemberID into another application.
[18:01:22] <coldhead> EMonk: can you not provide them with the ID via some other element? an <input> perhaps?
[18:01:41] <coldhead> selecting text in tabs isn't especially idiomatic
[18:01:46] <coldhead> can't do it with browser tabs
[18:03:03] <EMonk> @coldhead I could, yes, but that adds more elements to an already crammed page.  They are used to being able to select arbitrary text from within a webpage, and don't want to understand why this is not correct or elegant.
[18:05:03] <coldhead> yononi: http://jsfiddle.net/D8Nda/1/
[18:05:19] <coldhead> you had n < i instead of i < n in your for loop
[18:05:28] <EMonk> If there's no simple solution I'll just show them how to select the full list of tabs and be done with it.  Usability won't suffer any, I don't think.
[18:05:48] <coldhead> EMonk: just do whatever ajpiano says
[18:05:55] <coldhead> he's an Authority
[18:06:25] <EMonk> One day I'll fiddle with the jquery.ui.tabs code see if I can make it dance to MY tune :)
[18:08:13] <yononi> coldhead: thanks for noting, but that is not the issue, it was a quick extract of the real code, so i swapped n and i there (shouldn't have done that)
[18:08:26] <ajpiano> you could probably stick a button into the tab and create a text selection range
[18:08:31] <ajpiano> of the text content of the tab
[18:08:34] <ajpiano> if you were so inclined
[18:08:58] <coldhead> yononi: so did you fix it?
[18:09:19] <yononi> coldhead: no quite, there is still something undefined
[18:09:41] <coldhead> it works in the fiddle i posted
[18:09:51] <yononi> coldhead: and my browser is bugging out al the time, doesn't speed up things...
[18:10:14] <coldhead> harsh
[18:10:56] <yononi> it's a rather large data set and loggin the whole thing to the console accidentially crashes ff; there is not way to prevent js from doing those things during testing/developing, is there?
[18:11:26] <coldhead> use a smaller dataset for testing?
[18:11:39] <coldhead> see if chrome web inspector is more stable?
[18:11:48] <EMonk> ajpiano: I'll consider that one, thanks.
[18:12:01] <ajpiano> trying to make a demo quickly here
[18:12:21] <EMonk> yononi: Cut your array size down to 10x10 or so in the fiddle until you get the code right, then expand it again in your testing.
[18:12:52] <yononi> that's not really the problem, though
[18:13:51] <coldhead> this is the real problem http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/137/5c4.jpg
[18:13:59] <yononi> i can't really see what exactly is referenced by "TypeError: can't convert undefined to object   grid[i][j] = cell" - is it the cell that should be inserted?
[18:14:06] <PrgmrBill> haha
[18:14:28] <yononi> coldhead: oh, you found a nice picture of me there ;)
[18:14:32] <coldhead> yononi: i think that is because grid[i] is not defined
[18:14:46] <coldhead> i was getting that error until i switched n and i
[18:17:03] <yononi> sure, but cell is of type Object and and Array object should be capable of storing objects of at least type Object, so why should it even be necessary to convert something here?
[18:17:19] <yononi> i mean this error message is surely right, i'm just not getting it
[18:17:59] <ejcweb> I'm setting the HTML content of a div using the .html(element) method. Immediately after this, I look for an inserted element, using $('#div_inside_inserted_element'). This element doesn't always exist, or only returns something other than [] some finite number of millisecond later. Is there a callback for when the DOM actually all exists?
[18:18:52] <EMonk> yoyoni: The error is because you are trying to index a non-existent object, since your array is not correctly initialised.
[18:20:20] <emery-c> Hi, in JQTOUCH is there anyway to have a DIV that is inside one DIV and that DIV stays on the bottom (floats)?
[18:20:26] <EMonk> yoyoni: the expression "   grid[10][23] = cell;   " fails because "grid[10]" is not initialised due to the fault in your loop that coldhead pointed out
[18:20:29] <yononi> EMonk: sure, why is it still necessary to convert something in this case? is it just any arbitrary error message popping up?
[18:20:57] <yononi> yononi: and you forgot an 'n' there ;)
[18:21:18] <EMonk> yoyoni: You need to change your loop from "  for (var i = 0; n < i; i++) {  " to "  for (var i = 0; i < n i; i++) {  " to correctly initialise the loop
[18:21:29] <EMonk> yoyoni: sorry, correctly initialise the *array*
[18:22:30] * yononi is still called 'yononi', not 'yoyoni'...
[18:22:39] <EMonk> yononi: Sorry, also spelled your name wrong.  Not on purpose.
[18:22:47] <yononi> 3 times !
[18:22:54] <yononi> use tab completion ;)
[18:23:20] <EMonk> Mental block.  Using an unfamiliar web-based IRC client.  *shrug*
[18:24:06] <EMonk> yononi: The point remains, you need to fix your initialisation loop.  Do that (and change newArray() to new Array()) and it might work for you.  Did for me and coldhead.
[18:24:40] <yononi> sure, this simple test case is working now, the real thing is not, however
[18:25:21] <EMonk> yononi: Then produce a test case that actually demonstrates the problem.
[18:25:36] <yononi> EMonk: that was the test case
[18:26:28] <EMonk> yononi: You said that the real thing is not working, even though the test case now is.  If the changes we suggested to get your test case working DON'T fix the 'real' thing, the test case was flawed.
[18:26:52] <EMonk> And on that cheerful note, I'm back to work.  Night all.
[18:29:23] <coldhead> goodbye forever, EMonk

[18:31:44] <veleiro> Can someone tell me the best way to pause an html5 video element at a certain time using javascript, but then pressing a buttons resumes play?  I have "if (this.currentTime >= 10) {this.pause(); }" but envoking ELEMENT.play(); or pressing play with the controls does not resume play properly (of course, it stops because currentTime is > 10)
[18:34:08] <ColKurtz> veleiro, you can also check a boolean var
[18:34:23] <ColKurtz> and inverse the var in your if{ } clause
[18:35:30] <ColKurtz> if ((this.currentTime >= 10) && (paused == false)){ this.pause(); paused == true; }
[18:35:33] <veleiro> my brain doesnt program well. does that mean set a boolean to true when currentTime is > 10
[18:35:33] <ColKurtz> doesn't seem very elegant though
[18:35:34] <ColKurtz> lol
[18:36:08] <ColKurtz> that way, after it pauses the first time b/c it's reached 10 seconds, then the var won't evaluate to true a second time
[18:36:08] <veleiro> thanks, makes sense!
[18:36:26] <emery-c> Can someone help me? I need to make a sticky "footer" inside only ONE of my DIVS in JQTOUCH
[18:36:33] <ColKurtz> personally I would probably use an html5 video library and I'm sure they would have a pause/unpause method
[18:37:08] <veleiro> i may look for one then, it will probably save me bunches of time since i don't think like a programmer
[18:37:48] <emery-c> If anyone can help me please PM me
[18:37:54] <veleiro> thanks!
[18:38:14] <yononi> hah, there is a loop that is not executed, suspicious...
[18:39:12] <ColKurtz> veleiro, in that case I would most definitely recommend a good HTML5 video library, will make things much easier. Sorry I cannot recommend one as I don't have much experience with any.
[18:39:29] <yononi> it was 'for (var i; i < something; i++)' instead of 'for (var i = 0; i < something; i++)' - it passed silently but was never caught as syntax/logic error...
[18:39:59] <yononi> now the sky clears up
[18:40:48] <yononi> is 'for (var i; i < something; i++)' supposed to slip through silently?
[18:41:22] <yononi> none of the consoles did detect it/produce a warning or something
[18:43:39] <shennyg> I am trying to append some html inside of a p tag I am adding with .html(). this is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/dHZm7/2/ I'm trying to get the button inside of the blue area. any tips would be great!

[18:46:28] <Afflicto> I'm inside a $.post('blah', {}, function(){   I need access to the element the was reffered to before this post function. How do do that?   }); -- Thanks in advance.
[18:47:06] <Afflicto> Can I do function(data, this_thing_i_need) ?
[18:47:40] <seich> you could store the element in a variable right before the post, and you should have access to the content inside
[18:47:50] <Afflicto> Nope I dont :\
[18:47:56] <guy> Any comments on how to improve the performance?
[18:47:57] <guy> https://github.com/anuary/jquery-table-sort/blob/master/jquery.ay-table-sort.js
[18:47:58] <yononi> shennyg: you are appending to target instead of the p
[18:48:18] <guy> Does it really require replacing the whole tbody? there isn't a better approach?
[18:48:49] <Afflicto> I tried: var that = $(this); -- then inside the function(){ $(that).dostuff()  } but it's not workign.
[18:49:15] <seich> that is already wrapped in a jquery object, so you shouldn't need to do $(that)
[18:49:26] <seich> you should be fine doing that.dostuff()
[18:49:43] <Afflicto> OOOH! of course XD
[18:50:16] <Afflicto> uhm.. ok it's still not working o.O
[18:50:29] <butblack> seich: were you talking about my query?
[18:50:30] <seich> xD
[18:50:54] <Afflicto> seich: codepaste: http://codepaste.net/jsu7yx
[18:50:55] <seich> nope, talking about Afflicto's problem
[18:51:37] <seich> Afflicto: hmm, let me see..
[18:52:28] <Afflicto> I went back in time to how it was a moment ago: http://codepaste.net/y3pft2
[18:52:38] <Afflicto> Originally wanted it that way.
[18:54:07] <tw2113> shennyg, i got it working
[18:54:25] <seich> Afflicto, can you try logging $(this) and seeing what it's currently pointing to
[18:54:37] <tw2113> $target.removeClass('ajax-loading').html(function(){ return '<p class="no-results">No Results Found.'+reset_btn[0].outerHTML+'</p>'; });
[18:55:02] <shennyg> tw2113: thanks!
[18:59:46] <Afflicto> Ok I fixed it. I nested all the $.post()'s. and it seems to work fine now. Thanks anyway x)
[19:00:58] <seich> x) okay
[19:03:31] <emery-c> Anyone here available to help? I have asked sevral times

[19:04:47] <emery-c> I am using JQTouch, and i need to make a sticky "footer" that is only seen in one "div"
[19:07:04] <seich> hmm, damn I might not be of much help then, my experience with JQTouch is pretty much null ;( sorry
[19:07:30] <emery-c> Ok
[19:07:59] <emery-c> Do you know how to make a sticky footer div? i have tried some with CSS and JQuery and they didn't work (offline)
[19:08:44] <innociv> something along the lines of googling css push footer
[19:08:55] <emery-c> Ok
[19:09:21] <innociv> Or do you mean one that is always there even when scrolled up?  That's as simple as position:fixed; bottom:0
[19:09:32] <innociv> Anyway I gtg.
[19:10:40] <emery-c> Yes that is what i mean ^
[19:10:58] <seich> that's the easiest way to do it then ;O
[19:11:03] <emery-c> Ok, thanks :)
[19:11:08] <seich> :)
[19:14:00] <emery-c> seich -- That does not work, or so i think it doesn't, unless i am doing it wrong
[19:15:28] <seich> emery-c, how about something like this: http://snippi.com/s/j3lw4dr
[19:15:56] <guy> Javascript doesn't support shorthand ternary operators? like $(this).data('foo') ?: 'something else'
[19:16:34] <emery-c> seich -- I can't test that on it, it uses DIV, everything would "stick" :P
[19:17:06] <seich> emery-c, yeah xD it's a basic example, just make the selector more specific
[19:17:35] <emery-c> yes, i did, it does not work, i think it is something to do with JQTouch
[19:18:35] <seich> what selector did you use?
[19:21:43] <emery-c> footer
[19:23:49] <seich> I don't think jqtouch is overwriting that style, it doesn't seem to have anything regarding a footer
[19:24:10] <emery-c> No, but it may be the way it is setup?
[19:24:44] <seich> Maybe.. open up the inspector and check what styles are being applied
[19:25:36] <emery-c> footer is being applied
[19:32:23] <ejcweb> I have an element in DOM, referenced by the variable 'el' in jQuery. In my code, the following: parent.html(el); console.log $(el.attr('id')).length, prints 0 to the console. This is a cut down example, and I can only reproduce it in certain cases. Can this ever happen?
[19:32:45] <ejcweb> ie. I set HTML content with jQuery, but the DOM doesn't actually exist immediately after.

[20:27:57] <edude03> Hello everyone, have a really minor issue, I want to have a form field disabled until the form is submitted, so I have it set to disabled, then on("submit" I remove the disabled attr, but how do I allow the form to be submitted after that? Tried returning true and it was a no go
[20:44:12] <clouder_> edude03, so it's disabled until they hit submit? meaning it's something you want them to see but easily change?  I'd probably use a hidden field, but I might not be understanding what you are trying to accomplish
[20:44:26] <clouder_> but not easily change*
[20:44:52] <edude03> clouder_ that's exactly it, I have a date field that's auto filled by a date picker
[20:44:56] <ejcweb> What practically is the difference between: parent.empty(); parent.append(el), and: parent.html(el)?
[20:45:30] <ejcweb> Where el is a jQuery created DOM element.
[20:45:31] <edude03> So since the date picker fills it in properly I don't want them to be able to change the value
[20:46:02] <dialman> This the right place to ask about problems building jquery with grunt?
[20:46:20] <dialman> Everything looks good until: Running "compare_size:files" (compare_size) task
[20:46:20] <dialman> >> CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified.
[20:46:32] <tash> I'd like to use .serialize() on my form ( .post ) but also pass a parameter that can't be found in the form's elements list.  Anyone know if that is doable?  I tried $.post( '/my/url/' ), serialize(), { param: var ], function(data){  //  } but that didn't work
[20:46:58] <tash> ignore that obvious bracket typo :P
[20:47:49] <tash> there are a lot of form elements, and I'd like to use serialize() becauase I'm lazy and don't want to create all the vars to pass in the .post ... but as I said, there is one more thing that I want to pass that isn't caught in the form ... unless I do a hidden input
[20:48:05] <tash> guess that'd work. rubber ducking, sorry
[20:48:37] <ejcweb> My question is this: Is .empty().append(el) equivalent to .html(el)?
[20:49:01] <clouder_> edude03, then I think I'd go for updating a hidden field on change. probably be better solutions, but that's what sounds easiest off top of my head
[20:50:00] <ajpiano> ejcweb: logically equivalent yese
[20:50:16] <ajpiano> *technically* speaking, .html( el ) is not a supported signature of .html
[20:50:32] <ejcweb> ajpiano: Because it takes a string, right?
[20:51:03] <ajpiano> yep
[20:51:06] <coldhead> technically speaking, lol
[20:52:02] <ejcweb> I'm just experiencing some different behaviour in my app is I use .html verses .empty().append.
[20:52:27] <clouder_> edude03, but just because they can't change the values via the interface you are providing doesn't mean they can't still send malformed dates or dates you don't want them to send.  just a warning if you are using this as only means for verifying sane input
[20:52:45] <ejcweb> Which I can't understand. Will there be any difference if I have event handlers attached to the element?
[20:52:52] <ajpiano> yes
[20:53:04] <ajpiano> one of them will clobber the event handlers
[20:54:06] <ejcweb> ajpiano: The html method, right?
[20:54:42] <ajpiano> yes, potentially
[20:54:46] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12330
[20:56:57] <ejcweb> ajpiano: The problem I'm encountering is that after I call .html(el), if I do $('#'+el.attr('id')), it matches nothing (until about 50ms afterwards).
[20:58:50] <ajpiano> so why would you be querying the DOM for the elemtne when you already have an element reference, for one thing
[20:59:23] <ajpiano> second, yeah, it's an unsupported signature
[21:00:00] <edude03> clouder_ no the backend verifies the format anyway, but people are dumb :P
[21:00:24] <edude03> Never trust the client right :)
[21:02:28] <ejcweb> ajpiano: I just did that as an example. The same is true for querying the DOM for child elements of the element in question.
[21:03:18] <ajpiano> and what about $(el).find("foo")
[21:04:43] <ejcweb> ajpiano: Yes, I shall try that. Maybe it'll work, but I just feel it strange that the normal selector method wouldn't work. Especially since I may want to use a plugin or some other code subsequently that will use the selector in it's normal form, and expect it to find the element I've just appended.
[21:09:28] <ajpiano> ejcweb: let's just undersscore again here that you're trying to do something that is explicitly not supported
[21:09:52] <ejcweb> ajpiano: Yes, I shall make sure not to use the html() method. Thanks for clearing that up!
[21:12:23] <ajpiano> ejcweb: also there's the minor detail that i can't prove what you're saying is true :p http://jsbin.com/ipabuw/1/edit
[21:22:34] <becom33> I wanna make a simple system witch navigates it pages with tablets . like when I click on the menu the correct page should open as a tab . but the problem is Im not sure how to get the data for the selected tab . can anyone give me a guide on that ?

[21:26:07] <RandalSchwartz> becom33 - are you familiar with the tabs UI?
[21:26:36] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[21:26:47] <becom33> RandalSchwartz, wait let me check
[21:27:30] <RandalSchwartz> the tabs ui is quite expressive
[21:52:50] <DarkGhost`> how would I make one div use animate, to slide over to another empty div?
[22:13:19] <abjorn> coldhead: !!!

[22:23:52] <h3nryturk> How can you ignore a .change() if the change is the disabled attribute being removed?
[22:24:14] <ngharo> change is natural, don't fight it
[22:24:33] <h3nryturk> :-p
[22:24:52] <abjorn> track the disabled attribute
[22:25:04] <abjorn> and if it's been disabled...don't do anything in the .change handler
[22:25:08] <abjorn> YAY IM NOT TOO DRUNK TO HELP
[22:26:12] <ngharo> good on you abjorn
[22:31:55] <abjorn> ngharo: inorite. After me and my friends finished a handle of crown i should be pretty out lol

[23:00:32] <guy> Is there any place to submit jQuery plugins?
[23:01:42] <Eviltwin> GitHub
[23:02:10] <tw2113> ^
[23:02:22] <guy> No, I mean, I have a plugin (this https://github.com/anuary/jquery-table-sort or this https://github.com/anuary/jquery-json-to-table) and is there a way to submit reference to them?
[23:02:33] <tw2113> reference where?
[23:02:48] <Eviltwin> Use SEO
[23:03:06] <guy> uh.
[23:06:00] <ngharo> use the force
[23:32:00] <coldhead> everything falls apart
[23:33:57] <abjorn> wut
[23:33:57] <b-ot> Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[23:34:04] <abjorn> very good, b-ot
[23:38:21] <dialman> b-ot: Markov chain?
[23:38:21] <b-ot> dialman, better not tell you now.
[23:44:17] <guy> how to remove any tr that have td with [colspan]?
[23:44:18] <guy> $('tr td[colspan]')
[23:44:27] <guy> $('tr td[colspan]').[something].remove()
[23:48:00] <guy> ok. got it.
[23:53:47] <masak> guy: $('tr').has('td[colspan]').remove(), I believe.
[23:54:49] <guy> yse
[23:55:25] <dialman> $('tr td[colspan]').remove(); worked fine for me
[23:56:26] <guy> that does not what you think.
[23:57:30] <dialman> I guess my simple test didn't catch something then :)
[23:58:49] <guy> var data = $('tbody > tr'); data.eq(0).before(data.filter('tr.ay-sort-top'));
[23:59:19] <guy> this should place 'tr.ay-sort-top' always first, but it doesn't
[23:59:23] <guy> what am I missing?
