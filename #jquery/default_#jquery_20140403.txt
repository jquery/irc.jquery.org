[00:00:09] <Uhkis>  /notify nickname tells you when he comes online
[00:00:14] <wa5ted> he owes me close to 1.5 k
[00:00:25] <Uhkis> wow
[00:00:31] <wa5ted> thats usd
[00:00:38] <wa5ted> so i am hunting
[00:00:41] <wa5ted> dont say anything
[00:00:55] <wa5ted> i missed him by 1.5 hours
[00:01:10] <wa5ted> first of all i dunno i need to make sure he doesnt run
[00:01:12] <wa5ted> hmmmmm
[00:01:30] <wa5ted> i missed him by 1 hour X(
[00:01:55] <wa5ted> Uhkis: i have irc logs on lock down
[00:02:01] <wa5ted> have a program scanning them
[00:02:04] <wa5ted> how did they miss it
[00:03:02] <wa5ted> irc logs quits right?
[00:03:04] <wa5ted> and joins
[00:03:34] <Uhkis> depends on client
[00:03:36] <Cork> wa5ted: depends on the client
[00:03:52] <Cork> and depends on settings
[00:04:04] <wa5ted> damn it
[00:04:08] <wa5ted> but wait
[00:04:14] <Uhkis> that too, for example i have ignored joins/parts/quits from all the big channels
[00:04:17] <wa5ted> wouldnt the server handle the quits and connects
[00:04:23] <wa5ted> since it send the header to hte client?
[00:04:25] <wa5ted> the*
[00:04:31] <Cork> wa5ted: it does
[00:04:35] <Cork> but the server doesn't log
[00:04:37] <wa5ted> but the logs would record all
[00:04:40] <wa5ted> why not
[00:04:44] <wa5ted> curious
[00:04:48] <Cork> performance
[00:05:00] <wa5ted> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20140401.log.html
[00:05:03] <Uhkis> that would be like 1TB per day :-)
[00:05:05] <wa5ted> ^ how come it logs others
[00:05:15] <Cork> wa5ted: theres a bot on here that logs
[00:05:28] <wa5ted> yup
[00:05:32] <wa5ted> so wouldnt the bot detect it
[00:05:42] <wa5ted> im still confused i mean it isnt a lot of data to grab
[00:05:44] <Cork> depends if they log quits
[00:05:50] <wa5ted> plus the server anyways sends the header so
[00:06:02] <wa5ted> what d oyu mean Cork
[00:06:08] <wa5ted> do you*
[00:06:20] <Cork> wa5ted: that bot logs what happens in this channel
[00:06:26] <Cork> not what happens on the network
[00:06:31] <wa5ted> ohhhh
[00:06:42] <wa5ted> interesting
[00:06:49] <Cork> so if he wasn't ever on this channel you won't see it there
[00:06:58] <wa5ted> so it relaly depends o nthe persons client whether nfo is given out
[00:07:06] <Cork> yes
[00:07:15] <wa5ted> how come then when i type /ns info nafta
[00:07:27] <wa5ted> it gives me his last occurance on this channel
[00:07:30] <wa5ted> as 1 hour ago
[00:07:35] <wa5ted> and if this is true
[00:07:39] <wa5ted> would it not be logged
[00:08:00] <Cork> no not the channel
[00:08:02] <Cork> on the network
[00:08:11] <wa5ted> lol interesting
[00:08:19] <Cork> /ns info is when nickserv saw him last
[00:08:30] <wa5ted> so he could be in nay channel
[00:08:33] <Cork> /whowas is when the server saw him
[00:08:33] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “whowas”.
[00:08:41] <Cork> O_o'
[00:08:50] <Cork> b-ot: hush
[00:09:11] <wa5ted> lol
[00:09:22] <Cork> or rather when the server saw the nick
[00:09:25] <wa5ted> so /ns info gives last position according to nickserv
[00:09:28] <Cork> doesn't have to be him
[00:09:34] <wa5ted> and nick serv gets his info from network
[00:09:39] <Cork> no
[00:09:43] <wa5ted> then?
[00:09:50] <wa5ted> sry im not following the system yet
[00:09:54] <Cork> nickserv tracks users on the network
[00:10:10] <Cork> as it handles registering nicks
[00:10:27] <Cork> so when a user has identified as a nick those times starts getting updated
[00:10:45] <Cork> and when the user goes away nickserv knows about it
[00:10:49] <wa5ted> so if i enter as wa5ted
[00:10:51] <wa5ted> without
[00:11:08] <wa5ted> without /msg NickServ identify <password>.
[00:11:12] <wa5ted> then it wont log
[00:11:18] <wa5ted> or it logs regardless
[00:11:31] <Cork> it will see you as not online
[00:12:40] <wa5ted> so when i did /ns info nafta it said
[00:12:55] <wa5ted> Information on nafta (account nafta):

[00:17:32] <Cork> wa5ted: you don't know thqat
[00:17:35] <Cork> *that
[00:17:45] <Cork> all you know is that he was online and identified
[00:17:54] <wa5ted> dman aight
[00:17:56] <Cork> what channel he was on isn't tracked
[00:17:56] <wa5ted> hmmmmmm
[00:18:01] <wa5ted> damn it
[00:18:33] <wa5ted> Cork: any way i can track the channels
[00:18:36] <wa5ted> :D
[00:18:44] <Cork> no
[00:18:58] <Cork> you would have to have a client on the channel and log it
[00:20:01] <wa5ted> damn
[00:20:03] <wa5ted> hmmmm
[00:20:06] <wa5ted> irc so usefull
[00:20:10] <wa5ted> and the again its not
[00:20:12] <wa5ted> hmmmmm
[00:20:15] <wa5ted> anyways
[00:20:20] <wa5ted> I have changed my nick since
[00:20:22] <wa5ted> so he wont know
[00:20:34] <wa5ted> and Cork dont say anything
[00:20:37] <wa5ted> seriously
[00:20:43] <Cork> wa5ted: why on earth would you borrow money to a random guy on irc??
[00:20:58] <wa5ted> he was suppose to pay me for a job
[00:21:08] <wa5ted> it was settled too
[00:21:12] <wa5ted> i sent the invoice
[00:21:19] <wa5ted> cash never got to me
[00:21:27] <wa5ted> went on his "honeymoon" never got back to me
[00:21:30] <Cork> just take it as a loss
[00:21:33] <Cork> and move on
[00:21:42] <wa5ted> Cork: he was here today
[00:21:52] <Cork> well not "here"
[00:21:56] <wa5ted> if there was a slightest chance of getting soemthing back
[00:22:02] <wa5ted> wouldnt you make an effort?
[00:22:05] <Cork> no
[00:22:11] <wa5ted> well im differnt  :D
[00:22:28] <wa5ted> and its not like im asking you to help me find the guy
[00:22:38] <wa5ted> im asking the functionality and limitations of irc
[00:22:48] <wa5ted> with a particular application :D
[00:23:04] <Cork> wa5ted: the amount of time your would have to put in for the likelyhood of finding him
[00:23:17] <wa5ted> true
[00:23:18] <Cork> would be more then the payment most likely
[00:23:42] <wa5ted> Cork: one last question, i did the /notify command
[00:23:51] <wa5ted> whats the command if i wanna talk to that person
[00:23:58] <wa5ted> direct regardless of the channel im in
[00:24:01] <Cork> /msg
[00:24:04] <wa5ted> aight
[00:24:17] <wa5ted> thanks
[00:24:24] <wa5ted> bt what time is it where you are
[00:24:25] <Cork> and if i where to do a payed job on irc i would use a service where they deposit the money and when the result is delivered it is transfered
[00:24:28] <wa5ted> your always on at this time
[00:24:43] <wa5ted> lol first contract work
[00:24:44] <Cork> wa5ted: i'm always on; period

[00:27:15] <b-ot> Cork: ZNC → http://znc.in/
[00:29:17] <Cork> wa5ted: fyi he was in #nginx back when he was on today
[00:29:37] <wa5ted> wait
[00:29:39] <wa5ted> a sec
[00:29:43] <wa5ted> you know this guy was there
[00:29:44] <wa5ted> how
[00:30:33] <wa5ted> what are you a ninja
[00:30:44] <wa5ted> Cork: how the hell did you know you open every channel on irc
[00:31:06] <Cork> wa5ted: no but i have a few of them
[00:31:14] <Cork> and i log all the channels i'm in
[00:31:18] <Cork> so i just searched the logs
[00:32:31] <wa5ted> Cork: you are a god
[00:32:37] <wa5ted> you always were
[00:32:51] <wa5ted> one of these days I will return back permanently to help on #jquery
[00:33:46] <Cork> wa5ted: but really, if you are to do jobs like that, make sure you use a service to handle the payment, else your going to experience things like this over and over again
[00:34:24] <wa5ted> example service?
[00:35:27] <Cork> wa5ted: i don't do contracting so i don't have one
[00:35:30] <Cork> but i know they exist
[00:35:53] <wa5ted> true
[00:36:03] <xec> they probably know in #ccs-lance
[00:36:09] <wa5ted> im using a 50 on sign 50% on delivery
[00:36:11] <wa5ted> now
[00:36:29] <wa5ted> xec: really? (oh also and hi :) )
[00:37:31] <xec> yeah, as far as i understand, that's where webdevs for hire usually hang out
[00:39:16] <wa5ted> true
[00:42:26] <wa5ted> xec:  did you know Cork is a ninja
[00:42:34] <wa5ted> hes fricken everyhwere
[00:42:37] <wa5ted> where
[00:45:55] <motaka2> can anyone please explain me this pattern? '/(?<!^)(?!$)/u'
[00:50:42] <xec> wa5ted: no, if he was a ninja you wouldn't ever see him ;)
[00:50:55] <xec> he's more like a god
[00:50:56] <wa5ted> lol
[00:51:13] <xec> all-knowing, all-seeing ;D
[00:51:15] <wa5ted> xec: bro this guy is everywhere, i am looking for someone, and he finds the person and where they are
[00:51:17] <wa5ted> yes
[00:51:20] <wa5ted> thats what i said
[00:51:24] <wa5ted> Cork is a god
[01:26:05] <wfx> hi, was is the right way to get an array form a data-* like data-foo-bar="ka:va, kb:vb"
[01:26:35] <Cork> wfx: that isn't an array
[01:27:07] <jillesme> That's why he wants to turn data into an Array :p
[01:27:08] <Cork> wfx: you can get an object if you have data-foo-bar="{ka:'va',kb:'vb'}"
[01:27:29] <Cork> wfx: or you could get an array from data-foo-bar="{['va','vb']"
[01:27:33] <jillesme> wfx: yourelement.value.join(',');
[01:27:34] <Cork> opps
[01:27:40] <Cork> *data-foo-bar="['va','vb']"
[01:27:54] <wfx> sorry, this data-foo-bar is a html element attribute
[01:28:02] <Cork> jillesme: no it is already a string
[01:28:10] <Cork> wfx: yes, that is what i talked about
[01:28:15] <wfx> ups
[01:28:17] <wfx> :)
[01:28:26] <Cork> wfx: or do you mean you want to split the string to an array?
[01:28:34] <jillesme> Cork: I thought he ment that
[01:29:07] <Cork> wfx: so if you want the data to be valid for what you talked about what you store in the field need to change
[01:29:13] <Cork> and .data() will do it automatically
[01:29:28] <Cork> wfx: else you can handle the attribute as a string, and split it manually
[01:29:43] <Grundell> Hello every one, since you guys are so helpful here i was going to ask you some more questions about jQuery, I would like to reload all the jQuery/javascripts when i change between landscape and portrait, though i would not like to reload the whole page. How is this possible to make ?
[01:30:03] <wfx> i have : <li><a data-sx-view="ka:va, kb:vb">.... and want to use it as an array
[01:30:09] <Cork> Grundell: you most likely don't want to do that
[01:30:13] <seutje> Grundell: you can't un-execute stuff
[01:30:25] <Cork> wfx: what is the resulting structure you want out?
[01:30:55] <Grundell> Okay so in order for my jQuery to change i need to reaload the whole page ?
[01:31:10] <Cork> Grundell: but sure you could do something like lisning for the perspective change and do window.location.reload()
[01:31:18] <Cork> but it is very heavy handed
[01:31:33] <Cork> Grundell: or just make your js handle the change
[01:31:35] <Grundell> that is what i have right now ...
[01:31:54] <wfx> $.each( myarray, function( key, value )... this way i want to use it
[01:32:27] <Cork> wfx: function(key, val) indicates that you want an object, not an array
[01:32:38] <wfx> so im wrong
[01:33:03] <Cork> wfx: and the least hacky, but very uggly way you could do that would be
[01:33:22] <Grundell> Cork: so simply try to create changes that are aimed to behave after the width of the page such ass css media screen but in js ?
[01:33:34] <Cork> wfx:  var obj = eval('{' + $(this).attr('data-sx-view') + '}');
[01:33:49] <Cork> but i really, REALLY, R-E-A-L-L-Y recommend fixing the data you store instead
[01:34:22] <jillesme> wfx: http://jsfiddle.net/jillesme/fKcwv/
[01:34:42] <Cork> Grundell: well you would just have to base it on the value of elements
[01:34:48] <jillesme> Is that what you mean?
[01:34:51] <Cork> Grundell: and check what the new dimentions are as they change
[01:35:06] <Cork> jillesme: no
[01:35:10] <Cork> he wants an object
[01:35:35] <wfx> yes looks so :)
[01:35:39] <unnu> how would one go about getting the font size of selected text?
[01:35:54] <Cork> unnu: ugg
[01:36:03] <unnu> what?
[01:36:06] <Cork> unnu: that is the worst part to look for in js ;/
[01:36:14] <Cork> unnu: you have to create an inline-block element
[01:36:18] <Cork> add the text to in
[01:36:32] <Grundell> Cork: okay, so the script that you helped me with the other day for example, how do i add a check on window landscape or portrait ?
[01:36:33] <Cork> and measure the elements width/height
[01:37:01] <unnu> ? that seems redicoulus? you can set it with document.execComand
[01:37:28] <Cork> what?
[01:37:42] <Cork> i'm not sure we talk about the same thing here
[01:37:46] <wfx> aaaah my housekeeping turns the server of :)
[01:38:12] <unnu> i know you can set the font size with document.execCommand("fontsize", true, 5)   or something to that nature, but is there no easy way to get it?
[01:38:19] <unnu> jesus JS, step your game up
[01:38:22] <unnu> lol
[01:38:23] <unnu> j/k
[01:38:44] <Cork> unnu: you set the font size in css
[01:38:51] <unnu> hrmmm
[01:38:56] <Cork> why would execCommand have anything to do with it?
[01:38:56] <unnu> but for a selection of text
[01:39:01] <jillesme> wfx: here: http://jsfiddle.net/jillesme/fKcwv/1/
[01:39:06] <unnu> i would have to set up a span or something around it
[01:39:10] <jillesme> Wrote a
[01:39:19] <jillesme> Function that does the trick for you
[01:39:33] <unnu> also, i have a (font size up) (font size down) buttons i am working on
[01:39:41] <Cork> unnu: you mean you want selected text to be a different size from the normal text?
[01:39:49] <Cork> or are you talking about contentEditable?
[01:39:54] <unnu> i was gunna get the font size, ++ or -- and tada
[01:39:56] <unnu> content Eitble
[01:40:01] <Cork> ...
[01:40:05] <Cork> you should kinda mention that
[01:40:09] <unnu> OH
[01:40:09] <unnu> lol
[01:40:12] <Cork> as it makes a heck of a lot of difference...
[01:40:31] <unnu> My bad Cork. I am a PHP programmer, not javascript
[01:40:47] <unnu> this is a (to quote aladin) WHOLE NEW WORLD
[01:40:51] <Cork> jillesme: you get extra space in your key names
[01:41:20] <wfx> i test it...
[01:41:45] <unnu> so, is there an easy way to change the size of selected text in a content editable?
[01:41:47] <jillesme> Cork: you're right
[01:41:56] <Cork> unnu: well to make fontsize work it has to inject an element where the selection exist
[01:42:13] <unnu> such as a span, and create inline css?
[01:42:19] <d3m0n> When running and if statement is it good practice to return false on the else?
[01:42:31] <d3m0n> Or okay to just leave the if
[01:42:37] <jillesme> http://jsfiddle.net/jillesme/fKcwv/3/ wfx Cork
[01:42:46] <d3m0n> When running an*
[01:42:50] <Cork> unnu: i think they create a span or a div depending on the situation
[01:42:57] <Cork> and sometimes a p
[01:42:58] <dyu> has anyone encountered problems with pagespeed/jquery? basically our JS acts up when we turn on pagespeed. the browser complains it can't find certain functions. our guess is because $ doesn't mean anymore but when we checked the browser's console it still is.
[01:43:11] <unnu> alright,
[01:43:16] <wfx> works perfectly
[01:43:21] <unnu> thanks Cork, i think i know the direction to take now.
[01:43:28] <wfx> jillesme: thanks a lot!
[01:43:34] <jillesme> No problem!
[01:44:39] <unnu> Cork, i wouldn't suppose you would have a magic wrapping function to wrap tags around selected text, look to see if they already exist and instead close the tags before and re-open afterwards to "unwrap" the tags from the text all in one go
[01:44:40] <unnu> would you?
[01:44:42] <unnu> lol
[01:44:51] * unnu had to learn JS sometime
[01:45:10] <Cork> unnu: no, not magical
[01:45:26] <unnu> Cork: otherwise?
[01:45:27] <Cork> it is actually quite tedious work to get right
[01:45:52] <Cork> as you might even cross multiple elements, and multiple textnodes and...
[01:45:55] <Cork> (not fun)
[01:45:56] <unnu> that sounds not fun :(
[01:45:59] <Cork> ya
[01:46:14] <unnu> luckally my enviroment closes all tags inside of the container div
[01:46:19] <unnu> so i just have to search said div
[01:46:30] <Cork> unnu: but what i meant is the command thing wraps the text in an element
[01:46:50] <Cork> your problem will be to find the element
[01:47:02] <Cork> and i don't remember how you do that of the top of my head
[01:47:09] <unnu> find what element?
[01:47:21] <Cork> you want the current font size i guess?
[01:47:32] <unnu> well, if i can itterate the font size
[01:47:33] <unnu> that is fine
[01:47:36] <unnu> up or down
[01:47:37] <unnu> also
[01:47:41] <Cork> to get that you need to find the closest parent element
[01:47:48] <unnu> i have a wrapping function that jphase wrote up for me
[01:47:50] <gianiaz> Hi, I have to do an ajax SYNC request. In the doc I've found a note that says that async:false is depreated. I should use done(), but I cant understand how it works, can you help me?
[01:47:55] <unnu> but it does no unwrapping
[01:47:55] <Cork> but as different parts of the selected text can have different sizes...
[01:47:58] <Cork> ugg
[01:48:07] <unnu> also, i get the idea
[01:48:13] <Cork> (please don't ask me to look at it)
[01:48:19] <unnu> why?
[01:48:20] <unnu> lol
[01:48:23] <unnu> i didn't want you to
[01:48:28] <unnu> but i am curious why
[01:48:39] <Cork> gianiaz: you should never ever use sync ajax calls
[01:48:52] <jillesme> ^ +1
[01:48:58] <Cork> gianiaz: as it can frees the browser/page for as long as the connection timeout is
[01:49:04] <Cork> and that can be several minutes
[01:49:22] <Cork> gianiaz: so things that are to support ajax calls should never depend on return values
[01:49:27] <gianiaz> Cork I want to register where the user clicks on the page to create an heatmap
[01:49:43] <gianiaz> but if you click on a link I loose this information
[01:49:48] <Cork> gianiaz: why do that ever have to be sync?
[01:49:55] <Cork> ah
[01:49:57] <Cork> hmm
[01:50:04] <gianiaz> I'm doing some test
[01:50:11] <gianiaz> if this become inusable
[01:50:16] <Cork> gianiaz: those things are sadly kinda hard to support now days
[01:50:22] <Cork> as browsers remove those events
[01:50:35] <Cork> but ya, that is the single use case for sync ajax calls
[01:50:40] <gianiaz> ;)
[01:50:40] <Cork> in the unload event
[01:50:54] <Cork> gianiaz: but be warned that it won't work in all browsers
[01:51:10] <gianiaz> cork, even if I decide not to use it, now I can't live without know how to do it :D
[01:51:27] <Cork> gianiaz: you could do it with websocket i think
[01:51:32] <gianiaz> I cant' understand the doc about done(), and it is frustating
[01:51:51] <gianiaz> mmm, I will take a look
[01:51:53] <Cork> gianiaz: .dune is just a deferred format of the success: callback
[01:52:08] <Cork> *.done
[01:52:18] <gianiaz> and this makes the ajax call sync?
[01:52:21] <Cork> no
[01:52:40] <Cork> but it means you can return a callback from a function
[01:53:01] <gianiaz> then there isn't a way to do a sync call without using the deprecated method, right?
[01:53:02] <Cork> function makeCall() { return $.ajax() } .... makeCall().done(function(data) {})=
[01:53:12] <Cork> gianiaz: correct
[01:53:25] <gianiaz> ok, thank you Cork
[01:53:38] <Cork> gianiaz: but the point is that sync ajax calls, in browsers is legacy too
[01:53:50] <Cork> it isn't maintained anymore
[01:54:09] <unnu> So wait, H1 tags stack in html5?
[01:54:49] <Cork> stack?
[01:54:54] <unnu> uhhhm
[01:55:19] <unnu> <h1><h1> This Text </h1></h1> is bigger than <h1> this text</h1?
[01:55:20] <Cork> i don't think theres ever been a spec preventing you from nesting them if that is what you mean
[01:55:21] <unnu> shit
[01:55:30] <Cork> unnu: that depends on your css
[01:55:34] <Cork> not the html standard
[01:55:41] <unnu> okay
[01:55:46] <gianiaz> unnu, it's horrible :D
[01:55:50] <Cork> unnu: also if you want to talk about specs, use a spec reference and not a buzzword
[01:56:07] <unnu> Cork, i am teaching myself, so i dont know all the buzzwords
[01:56:10] <Cork> html5 is a buzzword without a technical meaning
[01:56:18] <unnu> but i would love to learn
[01:56:30] <unnu> all the spec references and such
[01:56:42] <Cork> unnu: html5 means, hw acceleration, websocket, css3, canvas, dom apis, user interaction ...
[01:56:42] <Uhkis> html5 buzzword? explain please
[01:56:48] <Cork> it is a totally meaningless word
[01:56:54] <unnu> HTML5  does websockets?
[01:56:56] <Cork> Uhkis: the spec is "html"
[01:56:57] <unnu> like c style?
[01:56:59] <unnu> nvm
[01:57:03] <unnu> i will look into that later
[01:57:07] <unnu> lol
[01:57:15] <Cork> unnu: html5 is a buzzword, where ppl push in every thing "new and fancy"
[01:57:20] <unnu> alright
[01:57:21] <Cork> it doesn't mean anything specific
[01:57:27] <Cork> that is what i meant by buzzword
[01:57:53] <Uhkis> Cork: well html5 itself did bring some new tags and attributes
[01:57:56] <unnu> anyway, "nested h1 tags" . . .
[01:58:07] <Cork> Uhkis: no the new html living standard did
[01:58:14] <Cork> html5 was the old name of the spec
[01:58:21] <Cork> and it was dropped cause it was abused too much
[01:58:55] <Uhkis> oh
[01:58:56] <Cork> Uhkis: http://www.whatwg.org/html
[01:58:59] <Cork> that is the spec
[01:59:00] <unnu> so how does one fix the <h1> <h1> thing?
[01:59:14] <unnu> so that they do not stack size
[01:59:32] <Cork> unnu: set you h1 tags to have a fixed size instead of relative
[01:59:37] <Cork> (in your css)
[01:59:42] <unnu> aight
[02:00:04] <Cork> font-size: 150%; font-size: 1.2rm; font-size 1.3em; and so on is relative
[02:00:18] <Cork> while px, rem, cm, mm and so on is absolute
[02:00:40] <Cork> rm... sorry
[02:00:48] <Cork> is ie ex?
[02:00:53] <Cork> don't remember
[02:02:02] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Units
[02:05:48] <unnu> idk, i am using px
[02:06:12] <lilalinuxKL> Hey guys
[02:06:20] <unnu> okay, nvm, fixed it
[02:06:36] <lilalinuxKL> I need to write some code for an atlassian gadget, which also provides jquery
[02:07:04] <lilalinuxKL> but it has to be used with AJS.$ instead of $
[02:07:43] <lilalinuxKL> now a library that I want to use uses $. Can I map the two names somehow?
[02:07:59] <lilalinuxKL> without replacing every $ in the library by AJS.$?
[02:08:49] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: window.$ = AJS.$;
[02:08:56] <lilalinuxKL> thank you
[02:09:19] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: plugins should normally use jQuery though
[02:09:22] <Cork> and not $
[02:09:57] <lilalinuxKL> k
[02:10:20] <Cork> and if the plugin actually does that you might be in an incompatible situation
[02:10:45] <Cork> (and really widgets shouldn't bundle jquery to begin with)
[02:10:53] <lilalinuxKL> I don't
[02:11:01] <lilalinuxKL> atlassian bundles it
[02:11:06] <lilalinuxKL> the widgets use it
[02:11:14] <Cork> ya, it was what i talked about
[02:11:39] <lilalinuxKL> i see
[02:11:42] <Cork> so might be worth looking for a less messed up widget
[02:12:17] <lilalinuxKL> so my widget should ship it's own jquery?
[02:12:24] <Cork> no, never
[02:12:28] <Cork> EVER
[02:12:38] <Cork> it should depend on jquery
[02:13:14] <Cork> only situation where it is ok to bundle is if everything you do is inside an iframe
[02:13:23] <Cork> so you are completely isolated from the rest of the page
[02:14:13] <lilalinuxKL> atlassian gadgets are inside iframes
[02:14:47] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: then you can't really use it on widgets on your page
[02:15:08] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: i didn't mean iframes with inline content
[02:15:16] <Cork> i meant the entire widget was an iframe
[02:15:19] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: the gadget framework includes the AJS framework
[02:15:38] <Cork> yes and the framework you use to talk with the iframe include jquery
[02:15:44] <Cork> that is where things goes wrong
[02:16:07] <lilalinuxKL> :-/
[02:17:07] <lilalinuxKL> Ok, so if I shouldn't use AJS.$ and not ship my own, you suggest I should include it remotely?
[02:17:33] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: my point is widgets should never include jquery
[02:17:46] <Cork> the page should load it, and widgets should just expect it to be there
[02:17:47] <lilalinuxKL> define include
[02:17:55] <Cork> bundle
[02:18:02] <lilalinuxKL> ah, now I know what you mean
[02:18:30] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: i've had this discussion with widget makers a few times
[02:18:51] <Cork> they want to make a widget the site can include without having to have dependencies
[02:19:02] <Cork> the problem is you create other dependencies instead
[02:19:14] <Cork> and it becomes much harder to manage the site if they do it like that
[02:19:40] <Cork> and not to forget the site becomes much much heavier if you load 2-3 such widgets
[02:19:59] <Cork> cause then you load several megs of jquery duplicate code
[02:20:08] <lilalinuxKL> yeah, batch.js of atlassian is already a monster :-/
[02:20:41] <Cork> those batchins should be done by the server hosting the site, or the developer of the site
[02:20:50] <Cork> not some random widget creator
[02:25:17] <SprkDev> My scripts are not loading in bootstrap modal? Why?
[02:25:44] <xec> because something is wrong
[02:25:51] <Cork> SprkDev: you often ask questions like that; why do you think anyone would know the answer?
[02:26:14] <Cork> one would have to see the code to answer the explicit problem
[02:26:20] <decx> i for one am a medium and know the origin of the problem, gremlins
[02:26:28] <Cork> generic "something breaks why" is impossible to answer
[02:35:55] <fRAiLtY-> does history.go(0) just refresh the current page?
[02:36:03] <Cork> yes
[02:36:10] <Cork> go(0) is the same as .reload()
[02:40:47] <CrowX-> I have an image that I would like to show/hide in a slideUp/slideDown manner. For this I have put the image in a container to which I am doing the slideUp/slideDown functions, and whose overflow is hidden
[02:41:12] <CrowX-> it worked fine, but now I want the image to resize to fit various browser screens
[02:41:24] <Cork> heh
[02:41:35] <CrowX-> so I made the image's width to 100% and its height to 85%(to leave place for the text bellow it)
[02:41:38] <Cork> CrowX-: that might be tricky
[02:41:46] <CrowX-> :)
[02:41:56] <CrowX-> so now when I resize its container, the image gets resized too
[02:42:04] <Cork> exactly :)
[02:42:13] <CrowX-> how can I make the image get hidden by its container, but resized by the browser? :)
[02:42:42] <Cork> CrowX-: before you do the animation set the height of the element to a fixed value
[02:42:52] <Cork> instead of 85%
[02:43:27] <CrowX-> Cork, and then set it to 85% afterwards?
[02:43:35] <Cork> no set it to ''
[02:43:41] <Cork> so it defaults to the rules value
[02:43:59] <CrowX-> Cork, but then how will it resize with the browser?
[02:44:29] <Cork> CrowX-: if you set css('width', '') you set the inline css value to an invalid value
[02:44:34] <Cork> so you fallback to what the css sets
[02:44:44] <Cork> and that should be your 85% value
[02:44:55] <CrowX-> oh
[02:45:01] <CrowX-> let me try that :)
[02:45:18] <Cork> CrowX-: the reason you want to do it that way is so you don't have to hardcode it in your code
[02:46:11] <CrowX-> Cork, when I set the fixed height, what should I base it on to get the full image?
[02:46:28] <CrowX-> I can't use $(container).height() because that's zero
[02:46:30] <Cork> $(img).height($(img).height())
[02:47:01] <Cork> you want to fixate it at its current height
[02:51:57] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: where should I place "window.$ = AJS.$;" so it will be set before the script src is loaded? Edit the library? or use some onload?
[02:52:49] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: you would have to set it in a separate script tag just before it
[02:52:50] <lilalinuxKL> forget that question
[02:53:00] <Cork> lilalinuxKL: but make sure you actually can fix it that way
[02:53:11] <CrowX-> Cork, when I set the image's height to itself it sets it to 0
[02:53:11] <Cork> i doubt you can
[02:53:16] <lilalinuxKL> yes, I'm still trying a PoC
[02:53:16] <CrowX-> i think
[02:53:20] <CrowX-> because it doesn't show the image
[02:53:42] <Cork> CrowX-: console.log($(img).height())
[02:54:07] <Cork> CrowX-: oh, and this will only work with sliding out
[02:54:19] <Cork> CrowX-: when you showing it it will be 0 height
[02:54:43] <Cork> so you will have to make a set to visible > grab height > hide again > slide
[02:54:50] <Cork> else you won't know what height to use
[02:55:25] <CrowX-> crkit says 0
[02:56:16] <CrowX-> Cork, would it work if I just use max-height instead?
[02:56:26] <CrowX-> ah nvm
[02:56:27] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[02:56:56] <Cork> CrowX-: the parent of the image change height when you do the animation
[02:57:05] <Cork> so you need to fixate the image before it
[02:57:10] <Cork> that is why you need to do this
[02:59:29] <CrowX-> what if I remove 85% from the css
[02:59:42] <CrowX-> then take the image's height, and set it to 85% after the animation
[03:00:12] <Cork> CrowX-: you will get the wrong image size while the animation happens if you do
[03:00:19] <CrowX-> hmm, but then the image would get ugly if it's bigger than the screen
[03:00:26] <Cork> you need to set a fixed height based on the screen size
[03:00:56] <Cork> CrowX-: basically you want it dynamic and static at the same time
[03:00:56] <CrowX-> what about the container's parent's height?
[03:01:06] <Cork> and that means you have to juggle the values
[03:01:21] <Cork> CrowX-: if you fixate the height you get two problems
[03:01:25] <Cork> the animations doens't work
[03:01:32] <Cork> and you can't detect the height of the display
[03:02:52] <CrowX-> so there's no solution? :)
[03:03:13] <Cork> here is, i told you a while ago
[03:03:23] <CrowX-> to show the image for a short time before the animation?
[03:03:30] <CrowX-> what would the visitor think :)
[03:03:32] <Cork> you need to let the page do a reflow so you get the final height of the image
[03:03:42] <CrowX-> what's a reflow
[03:03:47] <Cork> and then use that value as a static height while you animate
[03:04:13] <Cork> CrowX-: reflow is when the browser calculates the dimensions of elements in the page
[03:04:35] <Cork> so you need to set the parent to visible (without animation)
[03:04:42] <Cork> and then grab the image height
[03:04:49] <Cork> then hide the parent again
[03:04:55] <Cork> and set the image statically
[03:04:58] <Cork> and do the animation
[03:05:07] <Cork> after the animation remove the fixed height again
[03:05:39] <Cork> CrowX-: and that is basically the only way to can the all the behaviors you want
[03:05:49] <CrowX-> Cork, if I set the parent to visible, won't the image show for a tiny moment?
[03:05:55] <Cork> no
[03:05:58] <CrowX-> why
[03:06:14] <Cork> cause the page doens't draw until js has unwinded
[03:06:29] <Cork> and the process is back in the control of the browser
[03:06:51] <tanayc> Hi, how do I setup the testing environment for Jquery mobile
[03:20:02] <Tmw__> Hi Guys! Any Javascript developers willing to participate in a little survey? I'm doing a survey for my graduation on current best-practices regarding devstack and workflow when building Javascript applications. The survey can be found here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xQ0bnv3bFf5PeHvuIFh9UuzalWiS5cvtyZqIurlG5NI/viewform Thanks in advance! :D
[03:25:59] <JillesMe> Tmw__: jQuery !== JavaScript, ask it there too (##javascript)
[03:26:29] <Cork> JillesMe: well it is actually
[03:26:48] <Cork> jQuery === javascirpt but javascript !== jQuery :)
[03:26:53] <Tmw__> I will, thanks!
[03:27:10] <Tmw__> But your input will be very useful as well :)
[03:27:28] <JillesMe> Cork: You're completely right
[03:27:50] <JillesMe> I ment the channels
[03:27:51] <Cork> JillesMe: heh, i wasn't completely serious :)
[03:28:01] <JillesMe> But you were still right
[03:32:35] <CrowX-> Cork, the behavior is still the same
[03:32:39] <CrowX-> here's the part of my code
[03:32:39] <CrowX-> http://pastebin.com/Lh5bBBNG
[03:32:44] <CrowX-> am I doing something wrong?
[03:32:59] <Cork> CrowX-: yes
[03:33:01] <CrowX-> $(next) is the image btw
[03:33:08] <Cork> .parent().show()
[03:33:09] <Cork> not height
[03:33:25] <CrowX-> .parent() is shown the entire time
[03:33:31] <CrowX-> but with height of 0
[03:33:53] <CrowX-> Cork?
[03:33:54] <Cork> so you arn't using slideDown?
[03:34:05] <CrowX-> Cork, I'm using tweenmax
[03:34:12] <Cork> hmm, never seen it
[03:34:23] <CrowX-> i thought slide down just decreased the height till 0
[03:34:29] <CrowX-> which is what that tweenmax function does
[03:34:34] <Cork> also $(next).height($(next).parent().height()/100*85); is wrong
[03:34:44] <Cork> height() is the height of the element in px
[03:34:48] <Cork> not the procent value
[03:34:54] <CrowX-> that's what I need
[03:35:04] <CrowX-> because I'm setting next's height in pixels, right?
[03:35:15] <CrowX-> so i'm trying to calculate how many pixels are 85%
[03:36:01] <Cork> CrowX-: something like this http://pastebin.com/NNhXWXyp
[03:36:37] <lilalinuxKL> Cork: it works
[03:36:40] <lilalinuxKL> thank you
[03:43:30] <CrowX-> Cork, console log shows the height as we want it now, but the effect of the image showing is still the same
[03:43:40] <CrowX-> height and width increase together
[03:43:49] <CrowX-> instead of fixed full width and increasing height
[03:44:05] <Cork> CrowX-: skip the animation and inspect the img element
[03:44:09] <Cork> and check so height is set there
[03:44:15] <CrowX-> i did
[03:44:17] <CrowX-> height is set
[03:44:22] <Cork> O_o
[03:44:32] <CrowX-> oh wait
[03:44:35] <CrowX-> i didn't inspect element
[03:44:41] <CrowX-> I made a console.log
[03:44:57] <CrowX-> that shows the height after each step
[03:45:00] <Cork> you might need to use css('height', $(next).height() + 'px')
[03:45:29] <CrowX-> k
[03:45:55] <CrowX-> Cork, is that in the line where we set next's height?
[03:46:04] <Cork> yes
[03:48:03] <CrowX-> Corey, same
[03:48:09] <Cork> hmm
[03:48:19] <Cork> do you have a link?
[03:48:26] <Cork> or could you make a jsfiddle?
[03:50:45] <CrowX-> Cork, http://whatishacking.org/rach
[03:51:14] <CrowX-> Cork, I've only implemented the code for the images' sliding when you click the 'next' button. not the previous or the first image's loading.
[03:51:43] <CrowX-> 'next' is the iamge that loads when you press next.
[03:53:23] <Cork> CrowX-: you never set the height in the button-next event
[03:53:41] <Cork> you do set it in the imginfo event though
[03:54:11] <CrowX-> Cork, it's in the ajaxContent.js fiel
[03:54:12] <CrowX-> file*
[03:54:16] <Cork> ya
[03:54:30] <CrowX-> $(next) is the image
[03:54:47] <Cork> or sorry i read the wrong line
[03:54:57] <CrowX-> 124
[03:56:27] <Cork> CrowX-: next is the current
[03:56:28] <Cork> not next
[03:57:29] <CrowX-> Cork, that's after the animation
[03:57:43] <Cork> CrowX-: anyway you need to set max-height: auto; too
[03:57:49] <CrowX-> before the animation, next is the one that will appear, and 'current is the already appeared one'
[03:57:53] <Cork> as it is what resizes the element
[03:58:04] <CrowX-> Cork, in the css?
[03:58:11] <Cork> CrowX-: no before the animation next is id="current"
[03:58:22] <Cork> CrowX-: yes, when you set the height, you need to set max-height too
[03:58:45] <Cork> and set it to 'max-height': ''
[03:58:47] <Cork> when your done
[03:58:55] <SprkDev> I've noticed scripts don't work in modals. Is there a reason for this? I mean do you guys no of a workaround to get scripts to work inside modals?
[03:59:42] <CrowX-> Cork, to the image's container or to the image itself?
[04:00:05] <CrowX-> the max-height: 'auto'
[04:00:20] <Cork> CrowX-: the image
[04:00:42] <Cork> .css({ height: $(next).height() + 'px', 'max-height': 'auto' })
[04:00:50] <CrowX-> Cork, the image has max-height 85%, and height is unset
[04:00:53] <CrowX-> in the css
[04:00:55] <Cork> and .css({ height: '', 'max-height': '' }) when your done
[04:01:01] <CrowX-> oh, that css
[04:01:15] <Cork> CrowX-: yes, and you need to unset it so it isn't affecting the animation
[04:01:32] <Cork> or rather override it so it doesn't
[04:06:36] <CrowX-> Cork, still same
[04:08:36] <Cork> CrowX-: your not changing max-height
[04:08:36] <Rockwood> hello guyz
[04:08:52] <Rockwood> Cork hi
[04:08:58] <Cork> CrowX-: the code is still $(next).css('height', $(next).height() + 'px');
[04:09:27] <Rockwood> i am looking for jquery's registration design
[04:10:03] <CrowX-> Cork, i didn't upload it
[04:10:06] <CrowX-> sec
[04:10:39] <Rockwood> help me guyz please
[04:10:48] <CrowX-> ooh Cork could it be because we set  .css({ height: $(next).height() + 'px', 'max-height': 'auto' })
[04:10:54] <Rockwood> i am noob in jquery
[04:10:55] <Cork> no
[04:10:56] <CrowX-> shouldn't "height' be in quotes?
[04:11:02] <Cork> no
[04:11:07] <Cork> well it works either way
[04:11:11] <CrowX-> well 'max-height' is in quotes
[04:11:19] <Cork> max-height need to be in quites cause - isn't a valid key character
[04:11:26] <CrowX-> k
[04:12:11] <ddssc> in jq validate plugin rules , can I make a rule for a class of input fields? so all input fields that have class="foo" will be validated ?
[04:12:30] <Cork> Rockwood: registration design?
[04:12:54] <CrowX-> Cork, uploaded
[04:13:10] <Rockwood> i don't know jquery but i can make some changes in it
[04:13:52] <Rockwood> so i am searching for simple registration popup scipt for registration
[04:14:03] <Rockwood> with validation
[04:14:20] <Rockwood> cork
[04:15:22] <Cork> CrowX-: sorry it's max-height: none
[04:15:26] <Cork> not auto
[04:15:45] <CrowX-> ok
[04:16:05] <CrowX-> Cork, yes!
[04:16:06] <CrowX-> finally
[04:16:10] <CrowX-> it's beeeaaaautifuuuul
[04:16:15] <Cork> Rockwood: i don't think you will find a plugin that does all that
[04:16:15] <CrowX-> thank you
[04:16:25] <CrowX-> you're a jquery rockstar
[04:16:28] <Cork> Rockwood: plugins normally gives building blocks not full set features
[04:16:52] <Rockwood> Cork then what should i  do  ?
[04:17:26] <Rockwood> any suggestion for me ?
[04:18:24] <Cork> Rockwood: you would most likely have to learn jquery or get someone that knows it
[04:20:27] <Rockwood> cork its a very lengthy process as far as i can see
[04:22:00] <Cork> Rockwood: well someone needs to code what you need
[04:22:36] <Rockwood> i made a php registration script for my website
[04:23:11] <Rockwood> i wanna integrate jquery
[04:23:24] <BinaryKitten> how
[04:23:43] <BinaryKitten> that's like saying "I have a wall and i want to integrate a nail"
[04:23:51] <Rockwood> hold on showing something
[04:24:53] <Cork> BinaryKitten: lol
[04:25:31] <Cork> that one deserves a quote :D
[04:26:15] <Rockwood> something like this http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/
[04:26:39] <Rockwood> i have juqery's mater validation engine
[04:26:46] <BinaryKitten> ok.
[04:26:52] <BinaryKitten> so what's the issue?
[04:27:37] <Rockwood> but how should i put in the  validation
[04:28:03] <Rockwood> i am using jquery mastervalidation engine
[04:28:09] <BinaryKitten> however the plugin tells you to
[04:28:50] <BinaryKitten> i can't seem to find "jquery mastervaldiation engine"
[04:29:34] <BinaryKitten> are you talking about https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine/?
[04:30:59] <ddssc> in jq validate plugin rules , can I make a rule for a class of input fields? so all input fields that have class="foo" will be validated ?
[04:32:16] <spygame> hey guys, i have a weird jquery datepicker error, "cannot read property '0' of undefined https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9952756
[04:32:49] <BinaryKitten> ddssc i think so
[04:33:05] <ddssc> BinaryKitten: how?
[04:33:23] <Rockwood> https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine/blob/master/demos/demoAdjustments.html
[04:33:27] <Rockwood> i have this one
[04:34:04] <BinaryKitten> ddssc you create a rule
[04:34:19] <BinaryKitten> then you do $('.class').rules('add', 'yourrulename')
[04:34:20] <ddssc> BinaryKitten: nvm found it
[04:35:11] <ddssc> yea but your solution might work too
[04:35:15] <ddssc> thanks
[04:35:41] <BinaryKitten> ddssc remember the rules are meant to be used in a way that can be re-used
[04:38:07] <ddssc> BinaryKitten: always thought that validate only worked with forms
[04:38:18] <ddssc> as in $("form-selector").validate(
[04:38:26] <BinaryKitten> true
[04:38:35] <ddssc> didn't know you could assing validation rules for specific fields
[04:38:36] <BinaryKitten> but you can set your rules prior to that
[04:39:39] <ddssc> BinaryKitten: I don't need any custom rules
[04:39:51] <BinaryKitten> ah right
[04:39:59] <ddssc> just need to add rules for a class of input fields, as opposed to individual input fields
[04:40:23] <ddssc> so right now I'm looking at this:
[04:40:30] <ddssc> http://www.jqwidgets.com/html-form-validation-with-jquery-validator/
[04:40:50] <ddssc>  rules: [
[04:40:50] <ddssc>                 { input: '#userInput', message: 'Your username must be between 3 and 12 characters!', action: 'keyup', rule: 'length=3,12' },
[04:41:04] <SprkDev> How do I load external url javascript within a js file?
[04:41:23] <ddssc> SprkDev: you don't
[04:41:36] <BinaryKitten> SprkDev cerate a script tag in your html that points to it?
[04:41:59] <ddssc> won't that trigger csrf error?
[04:42:20] <SprkDev> But I need this for my modal. I have made everthing work so far. Need to load external js script inside the js file now.
[04:43:00] <ddssc> SprkDev: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[04:50:40] <SprkDev> what if I want to load script from url, how do I put the url in there?
[04:51:48] <ankurk_> anyone here uses animate.css?
[04:52:09] <ankurk_> I want to remove an element with animation.
[04:52:37] <ankurk_> I tried this, $divWithItemId.addClass('animated bounceOutLeft').remove(); But the animation doesn't work.
[04:53:01] <Cork> ankurk_: you can't animate removal of an element
[04:53:06] <Cork> you need to animate hide it
[04:53:07] <Cork> then remove it
[04:53:39] <ankurk_> Cork: let me try
[04:54:21] <jcool> js code: http://jsfiddle.net/8QanU/   throws Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[04:54:47] <SprkDev> what if I want to load script from url, how do I put the url in there?
[04:54:47] <jcool> not able to figure out whether there is error in jquery or something wrong with my php code.
[04:55:54] <Cork> jcool: what line number?
[04:56:07] <Cork> jcool: its most likely an error in your code
[04:56:09] <jcool> Cork, line no 1
[04:56:11] <abishek> I need a suggestion on a scenario I am trying to implement. I have a loop inside which I am executing a function. The function has a setTimeout based execution. How do I find out if the execution is completed with all the array items? I have a psuedo code here for your understanding http://pastebin.com/ducL7VtW . What I mean by successful completion is that all the array variables has been successfully processed inside the setTimeout execution\
[04:56:25] <Cork> jcool: then you must have something before this code
[04:56:46] <jcool> Cork, that's my complete .js file.
[04:56:48] <ddssc> SprkDev: $.ajax({
[04:56:48] <ddssc>   url: url,  dataType: "script", success: success});
[04:57:04] <Parsi> $("#mfrmAdd").on("click", function () {//code}); will these run even if in <input id="mfrmAdd" type="button"  onclick="return validateModal();" /> validateModal() returns false?
[04:57:46] <Cork> abishek: the code is a bit lacking
[04:58:17] <Cork> abishek: you mean you start a one second time on each loop, and want to check if there is any more values that haven't been processed when the timer fires?
[04:58:46] <Cork> jcool: your error doesn't match the code in that case
[04:59:00] <Cork> jcool: cause line 1 has no object infront of $
[04:59:21] <Cork> Parsi: possibly
[04:59:26] <spygame> guys i need help with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22836958/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-0-of-undefined-jquery-datepicker
[04:59:28] <abishek> Cork, I missed calling the function inside the loop, hope this clarifies http://pastebin.com/xzTk1RVY
[04:59:31] <Cork> Paraxial: event attributes and event listeners isn't compatible
[04:59:43] <Cork> *Parsi:
[04:59:47] <jcool> Cork, I will run a check on my code. seems some issue over there.
[04:59:52] <Parsi> Cork: how can I fix it?
[04:59:56] <Cork> Parsi: and by possibly, i mean you can't count on it either way
[05:00:03] <Cork> Parsi: don't mix event listeners and event attributes
[05:00:13] <Parsi> okay
[05:00:15] <Parsi> thanks
[05:00:18] <abishek> Cork, I want to know inside  the setTimeout that all the array variables have been processed, so that I start wit hthe next execution
[05:00:55] <Cork> abishek: js guarantee that all values will always have been looped when the first timer fires
[05:01:11] <naquad> hi
[05:01:13] <Cork> cause the firsts timers code can't execute before the loop ends
[05:01:25] <naquad> how do i combine two selectors?
[05:01:33] <Cork> ?api add
[05:01:33] <b-ot> Cork: .add(): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[05:01:48] <naquad> thanks
[05:04:27] <abishek> Cork, so do you mean, this will be executed sequentially? If you look at this, I have added the showProcessing() on this snippet, just to understand how it works http://pastebin.com/QfnayEKB. What would be the right place to add, hideProcessing if I want to call it after all execution is completed.
[05:04:45] <Cork> abishek: the loop will queue all the timers in one go
[05:04:50] <Cork> then it will wait one sec
[05:04:54] <Cork> and all will fire in one go
[05:05:25] <Cork> abishek: .each is synchronous
[05:05:43] <abishek> so me calling hideProcessing after .each will be the right place?
[05:05:51] <Cork> abishek: if you want to have a delayed loop you need to use setTimeout for the "looping"
[05:06:08] <abishek> Cork, could you give me an example
[05:06:11] <zyphz>  /clear
[05:06:26] <Cork> abishek: if you need to make each loop take one sec
[05:06:54] <krambiorix> hi, i have 2 on change events bound to the same input field like $("body").on('change','.myinput'.......    How can i force the the first binding to fire first?
[05:06:56] <Cork> you need to do something like function next(index) { setTimeout(function() { next(++index); }, 1000) } next(0)
[05:07:07] <Cork> for the loop i mean
[05:07:34] <Cork> krambiorix: you can't
[05:07:49] <Cork> krambiorix: only way would be to unbind the other events and bind your first
[05:08:11] <Cork> krambiorix: or have the other event listeners bound on a parent higher up in the tree
[05:08:30] <abishek> Cork, finding it difficult to understand, can you give me the above example in relation to http://pastebin.com/QfnayEKB
[05:08:50] <krambiorix> Cork that's a problem :s
[05:10:33] <ankurk_> Cork: Animation still didn't happen, I did this, $divWithItemId.addClass('animated bounceOutLeft').hide();
[05:10:57] <naquad> is there something like filter but stopping after first match?
[05:12:26] <Cork> abishek: http://jsbin.com/fujevudi/1/edit
[05:12:44] <Cork> ankurk_: hide sets display: none;
[05:12:53] <Cork> ankurk_: that can't be animated either
[05:13:06] <Cork> you need to set opacity
[05:13:26] <ankurk_> oh I didn't know that
[05:14:14] <Cork> naquad: not really no, you could do it in .each
[05:14:32] <Cork> but that would mean you would have to run the code inside the each loop
[05:14:35] <naquad> Cork, got that with throw currently, just thought there's some better way. thanks
[05:14:52] <Cork> throw?
[05:15:03] <Cork> you shouldn't use throw for code logic!
[05:17:38] <abishek> Cork, my main problem is more on where to call hideProcessing(). so from http://jsbin.com/fujevudi/1/edit, could you suggest where I call hideProcessing, so that I do my further execution when the execution of loop is complete? Should I call it after foo() has been called? or outside the next() function?
[05:17:41] <naquad> Cork, hello from throw $break in jquery :)
[05:17:56] <Cork> abishek: ah
[05:18:13] <Cork> abishek: in the jsbin you have a complete handler in the if statement
[05:18:19] <Cork> that is where everything is done
[05:18:41] <Uhkis> ankurk_: $youritem.addClass('animated bounceOutLeft').one('webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend', function() { $(this).hide();}); should do the trick
[05:19:08] <abishek> you mean the callback() function, i can execute the hideProcessing?
[05:19:33] <ankurk_> Uhkis: Actually I went with this, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/659e339c063323368326
[05:19:49] <Cork> abishek: if you pass a function to ExecuteMe yes
[05:19:57] <abishek> ok, understand it now
[05:20:01] <Cork> abishek: or you could just add the hideProcessing in the if statment
[05:20:47] <Cork> abishek: http://jsbin.com/fujevudi/2/edit
[05:21:12] <Uhkis> ankurk_: the way i said is pretty much copypaste from the animate.css docs
[05:21:25] <abishek> Cork, thanks. that helps
[05:21:33] <abishek> Cork, appreciate it
[05:21:42] <abishek> tells, me how much more I need to learn javascript
[05:21:59] <ankurk_> Uhkis: link?
[05:22:11] <naquad> return x !== undefined && x !== null; - is there something like in this jQuery?
[05:22:26] <Cork> naquad: why would it exist in jquery
[05:22:26] <naquad> i need a function telling me was parameter given or not
[05:22:31] <Cork> just use the native js
[05:22:34] <naquad> k, thanks
[05:22:46] <naquad> just trying to don't reinvent my own bike
[05:23:14] <Cork> naquad: though return x !== undefined && x !== null; could most likely be written as return !x;
[05:23:24] <Cork> opps
[05:23:28] <Cork> * return !!x;
[05:23:41] <_biff> hi
[05:23:54] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/
[05:23:59] <drager> but I can't get them...
[05:24:06] <_biff> could it be that a jquery process ended by  the browser?
[05:24:15] <_biff> because no error callback runs
[05:24:27] <_biff> but the succes callback runs
[05:24:34] <_biff> but without undefined values
[05:24:40] <_biff> *with
[05:24:54] <_biff> what i get
[05:25:01] <Cork> _biff: there are no jquery processes
[05:25:11] <_biff> ok jquery post
[05:25:22] <Cork> the browser might block the post if it is cross domain
[05:25:42] <Cork> but then you wouldn't get the success callback
[05:25:49] <_biff> if it is cross domain?
[05:25:52] <Cork> _biff: to little context to answer
[05:25:55] <_biff> but the succes method runs
[05:25:58] <Cork> ya
[05:26:02] <Cork> _biff: to little context to answer
[05:26:06] <drager> I'm getting an empty string...
[05:26:07] <_biff> but because there is no veluas i get undefined values
[05:26:13] <_biff> int that function
[05:26:30] <Cork> 1. content-type of the data
[05:26:32] <Cork> 2. what the data is meant to be
[05:26:39] <Cork> 3. the code for the call
[05:26:50] <_biff> Cork ok this is a simple "done" text message
[05:27:09] <_biff> so the php works in the background still when i get the undefined message
[05:27:14] <_biff> instead of "done"
[05:27:24] <_biff> and this is in the succes callback
[05:27:39] <_biff> so without timout error
[05:27:43] <_biff> for example
[05:27:58] <Cork> ?p
[05:28:12] <Cork> _biff: paste your code at jsbin.com
[05:28:21] <Cork> (jsfiddle.net is kinda down right now)
[05:28:29] <_biff> cork...
[05:29:00] <_biff> :) im trying to explain this...in the background in php started to run a qr code making...
[05:29:02] <decx> not for me
[05:29:21] <_biff> but before it would ended and would send the "done" text message, the succes method runs with undefined
[05:29:32] <Cork> _biff: if you want us to help you check whats the problem with the code is, and not just spam the channel
[05:29:35] <Cork> you need to show the code
[05:30:01] <_biff> cork why do u need code?
[05:30:04] <_biff> everything is works fine
[05:30:13] <Cork> i don't but you need to share it if you want help
[05:30:14] <_biff> so the trcik is the qrcode maker function
[05:30:29] <_biff> but it runs correctly without timeout if i simpli call without jqzery
[05:30:59] <_biff> if i comment out the qrcode maker i get the right "done" message
[05:31:09] <_biff> cork do u understand?
[05:31:33] <_biff> cork should i paste the qrcode maker php library?
[05:33:53] <nicken> any suggestions for making an element continue scrolling as content is appended to it?
[05:34:18] <Cork> nicken: animate the scrollTop as you append things?
[05:35:10] <nicken> scrollTop...
[05:35:24] <_biff> Cork http://pastebin.com/H0UWFgiP
[05:35:36] <nicken> seeing the word top in that name is throwing me off a bit.
[05:35:45] <titii> Hi, there is an option to use the same name of variable and function method of the plugin? Ty
[05:36:21] <nicken> so is scrollTop the position of the portion that's visible?
[05:37:04] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/ but I'm getting an empty string...
[05:37:11] <Cork> titii: same?
[05:37:23] <Cork> titii: that question doesn't really make sense
[05:38:03] <titii> Cork: yea, the method this.info = function(key) {... and the variable property this.info = {};
[05:38:17] <nicken> I actually found a quick copy/paste solution from stackoverflow involving scrollHeight and scrollTop.
[05:38:26] <nicken> but it seemed to only work half of the time.
[05:38:47] <titii> Cork: i know maybe this is not possible, but in php it is :)
[05:38:59] <titii> but i would like to ask
[05:39:12] <nicken> I basically have an event handler registered with socket.io that will append data received to an element.
[05:39:13] <Cork> titii: js don't have methods
[05:39:24] <Cork> titii: js has variables/properties and functions
[05:39:25] <titii> Cork: i see
[05:39:36] <nicken> and then afterward it will set the scrollTop to the scrollHeight
[05:39:37] <Cork> a variable/property can point to a function
[05:39:58] <Cork> titii: so you can't have a value with the same property name as a function, cause it would be the same property
[05:39:58] <nicken> but for reasons unknown, it doesn't always work
[05:40:28] <titii> Cork: i see, so only way is to give another name of variable
[05:40:34] <Cork> yes
[05:40:38] <titii> Cork: ok, ty
[05:43:04] <nicken> I also tried calling .focus() on the last element in the container
[05:43:13] <nicken> and it will work several times as content is added
[05:43:17] <nicken> but then it just stops working suddenly
[05:45:15] <nicken> I put the function that scrolls the container outside of any callbacks and outside of $(document).ready()
[05:45:31] <nicken> in case that would make it so that the code isn't cached in some way
[05:52:52] <wfx> i clean out now my code: http://jsfiddle.net/9y7EA/ it load html content and show it but i do something wrong it loads and then hide it?
[05:54:26] <jcool> Cork, now same code shows $ undefined. php code is proper.
[05:55:04] <wfx> the testing page is on http://213.47.145.99/oliver/
[05:55:48] <msafi> Guys, how do I .detach() the children of an element? If I do $('#myElement').detach('*') it actually removes #myElement from the DOM tree. I only want to remove what's inside it?
[05:55:58] <wfx> you see the content only if you press twice any link
[05:56:21] <Uhkis> jcool: if $ is undefined, it usually means jquery is not loaded yet
[05:56:23] <Cork> msafi: $('#myElement').children().detatch()
[05:56:55] <Cork> jcool: also take php out of the equation
[05:57:09] <Cork> jcool: php generates html, and that is all the browser sees
[05:57:50] <jcool> Uhkis, I have got my jquery at proper place. my inspect element also shows url to it. when I click on url it shows me js too.
[05:58:54] <msafi> Cork, Lovely! Thanks!
[05:59:01] <jcool> Cork, yeah agreed.
[06:05:07] <wfx> i add navigation to fidle http://jsfiddle.net/9y7EA/3/
[06:09:41] <wfx> got it :)
[06:10:43] <ocx> hi all, what is the difference between fieldcontain and fieldset elements
[06:11:10] <Cork> there are no fieldcontain elements
[06:11:43] * xec awards Cork the "nice answer!" badge
[06:12:50] <wfx> i move the $(sx_view) inside the each loop.
[06:13:06] <CrowX-> how can I check if an image is fully loaded when I change its src?
[06:13:22] <Cork> CrowX-: listen for it's onload event
[06:14:17] <ocx> Cork: fieldcontain data-role i mean
[06:14:20] <ocx> and fieldset
[06:14:27] <Cork> ah, jqm
[06:14:34] <krambiorix> in my application i update fields with jquery ... How can i 'bling' a field when updated?
[06:15:01] <krambiorix> 'bling' like animate the background color to green and then back to white?
[06:15:23] <Cork> ocx: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.1.1/docs/api/data-attributes.html
[06:15:56] <Cork> krambiorix: note that if you change the background color you will reset the theme of the input field
[06:16:29] <Cork> krambiorix: but you can animate the background color
[06:17:08] <krambiorix> Cork, animate it to the new color and animate back to old color isn't possible?
[06:17:08] <CrowX-> Cork, like after I change its src, I could run $('#imageID').load() { and here the image is loaded?}
[06:18:38] <Cork> krambiorix: sure it is
[06:18:56] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to extend animate with background-color animation though
[06:19:22] <Cork> jquery ui does it and there are separate libs too
[06:19:47] <Cork> CrowX-: you need to bind the event before you change the src
[06:19:52] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/ but I'm getting an empty string...
[06:19:59] <Cork> CrowX-: and the event will fire when the url is loaded
[06:23:30] <ocx> i have a jqm question, the checkbox below is not taking the jqm styling any idea? http://pastie.org/8991315
[06:24:18] <Cork> ocx: try reproducing it in jsfiddle or jsbin
[06:24:26] <ocx> sure
[06:27:04] <ocx> Cork: it works here http://jsfiddle.net/wWg39/1/ but on my computer it does not this is the header i am including http://pastebin.com/xyRHWeXf
[06:27:28] <Cork> ocx: are you injecting the checkbox or something?
[06:27:40] <ocx> injecting?
[06:27:48] <Cork> adding it through ajax or similar
[06:28:03] <ocx> no it is plain
[06:29:59] <Cork> check that the resources are loaded then i guess
[06:30:04] <Cork> donno what else it can me
[06:30:07] <Cork> *be
[06:33:48] <wfx> DOMNodeInserted is my friend :)
[06:34:31] <ocx> what is the difference between jmin.js and js files
[06:34:44] <Cork> wfx: that event is deprecated though
[06:34:44] <drager> Anyone?
[06:34:46] <wfx> size
[06:35:02] <Cork> ocx: the code is compressed with a js minifyer script
[06:35:17] <ocx> so better to use the min one
[06:35:30] <Cork> well unless you have min script on the server
[06:35:42] <Cork> minifyer i mean
[06:36:04] <Cork> wfx: did you catch the comment about the event?
[06:36:06] <wfx> Cork: $('body').on('DOMNodeInserted', '#CBL', function(e) .... change to?
[06:36:27] <Cork> wfx: the entire set of event is deprecated
[06:36:41] <Cork> all the dom modification events
[06:36:58] <Cork> they replaced it with mutation observers
[06:37:06] <Cork> ?mdn mutation observer
[06:37:07] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[06:37:38] <Cork> wfx: but if you need support for anything except the latest ie you are in a bit of a trouble
[06:37:49] <Cork> (older ies i mean)
[06:48:38] <effortDee> hi im using zclip copy clipboard and its fine in chrome but not in firefox :(
[06:49:04] <ddssc> anyone knows how to add validation rules for a class of input fields?
[06:49:26] <jcool> Cork, Uhkis well a bad mistake of mine was preventing me to load that. thanks for help :)
[06:49:49] <ddssc> for example can I have                      $(form).validate( {rules { .classname: { required: true }}   ?
[06:50:59] <CrowX-> how can I add a function to happen while an image is loading?
[06:51:23] <Cork> $('selector').load(function() {})
[06:51:41] <CrowX-> Cork, but doesn't that happen after the 'selector' load?
[06:51:54] <Cork> CrowX-: yes
[06:51:58] <CrowX-> I have that
[06:52:03] <Cork> you bind .load on the image
[06:52:08] <Cork> and it fires the event when it loads
[06:52:14] <CrowX-> now I want to disable a button while the iamge is loading, i.e. inbetween the loading start and end
[06:52:18] <Cork> CrowX-: if you are adding html with img tags in
[06:52:22] <Cork> you have to prepars them
[06:52:31] <Cork> bind the event listeners and then append the html
[06:52:44] <Cork> *append the dom fragment*
[06:52:58] <pwz2000> Can someone assist me? I have a lightbox setup. However it is showing the full size image, when it should be showing the specified profile size image. I had it showing the correct sizing previously, however when I made changes so I can add a button_to inside the lightbox it started to show the full size image only. I have the original and new code at https://gist.github.com/pwz2k/9954743
[06:58:15] <CrowX-> Cork, I would like to disable the click() event on the navigation buttons while the image isn't fully loaded. Is this the proper way to do it?: Define the buttons' click() function with its functionality within the image's load() event, and every time I change an image's src, to redefine the button's click() event to return false, so that it would be functional only after the image loads.
[06:58:24] <ankurk_> That feel good feeling when you remove repetitive parts of your jQuery Code :D
[06:58:26] <CrowX-> Is that good, or I could have race condition problems?
[06:59:03] <Cork> CrowX-: best is prob to have the handler statically and check a pref if they should be enabled or not in the handler
[06:59:22] <CrowX-> Cork, how would I check?
[07:00:49] <Cork> CrowX-: then you get the ajax call back you disable the handlers
[07:00:58] <Cork> CrowX-: and bind the load handlers
[07:01:10] <Cork> in the load handlers you check how many times they should fire
[07:01:24] <Cork> and when all has fired you switch the value to allow the clicks again
[07:10:10] <CrowX-> <Cork> CrowX-: then you get the ajax call back you disable the handlers
[07:10:15] <CrowX-> which ajax call?
[07:10:17] <CrowX-> which handler?
[07:10:26] <CrowX-> sorry, but I don't seem to understand you fully
[07:12:31] <BillCriswell> Ugh, windows.
[07:13:47] <krambiorix> i have $("body").on('focus', '.relateprevious1,.relateprevious2,.relateprevious3', function (e) {  -> how can i get the class that has been  bound in this function?
[07:14:16] <krambiorix> so if the .relateprevious1 is focussed, i want to get 'relateprevious1'
[07:14:19] <decx> e.target
[07:14:55] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Might need to use focusout instead of focus.
[07:15:00] <BillCriswell> Don't think focus bubbles.
[07:15:33] <krambiorix> decx : e.target has multiple classes
[07:15:56] <krambiorix> so my input field with class .relateprevious1 has also other classes...
[07:16:33] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: This seems like a weird thing to need to do
[07:16:52] <erming> use data attribute then
[07:17:22] <erming> <div class="relateprevious1" data-something="tadaaa">.. and then you can fetch $(this).data("something") in your event
[07:17:37] <erming> might be one way of doing it
[07:18:01] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: What do you need to do based on the class?
[07:18:12] <BillCriswell> Could be as simple as a loop with .hasClass() conditions.
[07:20:19] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i need to replace 'previous' to 'base' and then i know which element to call
[07:22:39] <krambiorix> ok i'll use data- ...
[07:22:44] <krambiorix> thanks
[07:22:55] <joelones> hi,  I have the following:  var oTable = $('#table').dataTable( { … "fnDrawCallback": loadModalLinks }); : loadModalLinks accepts an argument which is a callback function, and doing "fnDrawCallback": loadModalLinks(function () {}) doesn't seem to work, how would i do this with jquery?
[07:24:59] <dwarder> how do i delete element of an object so that i dont' see [undefined × 1,   on the place where i deleted it
[07:24:59] <TheWhisper> Say I have function B, which is inside function A
[07:25:11] <TheWhisper> and then I have function C which is its own function'
[07:25:17] <TheWhisper> How can I expose function B to function c?
[07:26:55] <fabioportieri> TheWhisper: put c inside a ?
[07:27:09] <TheWhisper> I don't want it inside A though
[07:27:21] <xec> make B a method on an object (instead of a regular function), or move B outside A (or move C inside A), (or make it global, ugh)
[07:27:38] <TheWhisper> xec, do you have any links about making it a method on an object?
[07:27:39] <fabioportieri> TheWhisper: then initialize a inside c, and use a.b ?
[07:27:58] <fabioportieri> where a is an object literal
[07:27:59] <BillCriswell> dwarder: I never had to do that, but I'd probably just create a new variable with the ones I need filtered.
[07:29:01] <BillCriswell> Like if I have var $foos = $('.foo'); and I only want .foo.bar I could do $fooBars = $foos.filter('.bar');
[07:30:02] <BillCriswell> If I wanted to just skip the first element I might do like $collection.slice(1).something()
[07:30:10] <xec> TheWhisper: it kind of depends on exactly what you're trying to do
[07:30:24] <TheWhisper> hm
[07:30:34] <BillCriswell> There's also things like .filter(':gt(1)') ( greater than )
[07:30:35] <xec> TheWhisper: why is B inside A in the first place?
[07:30:44] <TheWhisper> xec, because A calls B
[07:30:44] <decx> net neutrality, suck it american'ts
[07:30:58] <TheWhisper> and B relies on variables set in A
[07:36:51] <xec> TheWhisper: yeah you can't do that, and it would take some refactoring to use objects instead http://jsfiddle.net/73GNf/
[07:37:20] <TheWhisper> I'll take a look
[07:38:22] <xec> TheWhisper: the A() is capital because that's the convention for constructor names
[07:38:29] <TheWhisper> k
[07:38:45] <xec> (to let fellow devs know you need to call it with "new")
[07:39:42] <xec> what was your A function originally for?
[07:43:10] <dwarder> BillCriswell: danke
[07:43:15] <BillCriswell> dwarder: No problem.
[07:50:22] <SprkDev> Why do I have this error in console? Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'<meta charset="utf-8" />
[07:50:50] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: What are you trying to use toString() on?
[07:50:57] <SprkDev> how do I login? was it /msg Nickserv IDENTIFY username password
[07:51:29] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: no username, just password
[07:51:41] <SprkDev> nothing, O am not even using toString
[07:52:06] <BillCriswell> SprkDev: You need to provide some code in a fiddle then.
[07:54:37] <TheWhisper> xec: I just decided to trigger it with .click() on page load if # === X
[07:55:18] <xec> okay? doesn't make much sense to me without knowing what you're doing :)
[07:57:00] <TheWhisper> xec: I want to do X function if I click on linkB AND I want to do X function if I load the page with #linkB
[07:57:15] <TheWhisper> So http://i.imgur.com/cbR1a9D.png
[07:59:12] <xec> TheWhisper: ok, but since you're using jquery, you might as well attach event handlers with it: $(window).on("hashchange", function(){...});
[07:59:38] <xec> TheWhisper: using window.onhashchange = func; you can only have a single event handler attached
[07:59:49] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[07:59:57] <xec> (and it's the 1999 way of doing things)
[08:00:12] <Bloomberg> I have a great mistake with ajax on mozilla and chrome
[08:00:34] <Bloomberg> mi functions works perfect on mozilla, but firefox and safari doesn't nothing
[08:01:00] <Bloomberg> someone know why?
[08:01:27] <Uhkis> Bloomberg: it might be broken
[08:01:52] <xec> `demo
[08:01:52] <b-ot> xec: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:01:58] <xec> Bloomberg^^
[08:05:42] <fabioportieri> bye bye
[08:08:46] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: var $el = $(location.hash); if ($el.length) $el.trigger('click');
[08:09:12] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, I just did http://i.imgur.com/zmbtuen.png
[08:09:30] <aro> when dragging an item around in an unordered list, is there a way to determine if its position changed?
[08:10:53] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: For every item though, right?
[08:10:58] <TheWhisper> yes
[08:11:22] <BillCriswell> That's a lot of repetition for something like that.
[08:11:39] <TheWhisper> I guess
[08:11:52] <TheWhisper> Yours looks like it takes the amount of characters in the hash, no?
[08:12:53] <BillCriswell> var $sectionNavigationLink = $('.navigation').find(location.hash); if ($sectionNavigationLink.length) $sectionNavigationLink.trigger('click'); would do the same this without all the ifs
[08:12:55] <decx> that just checks if that element even exists before clicking it
[08:13:26] <BillCriswell> You can add new sections as you want without modifying the JS.
[08:14:20] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: location.hash is basically just retuning a selector for you.
[08:14:38] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, so that looks in the nav, gets the current hash, matches its length to the link, and clicks the one that matches?
[08:15:05] <BillCriswell> It just checks the length to make sure the link exists before trying to click on it.
[08:15:12] <TheWhisper> How does it know which one to click though?
[08:15:30] <BillCriswell> $(location.hash) === $('#about')
[08:15:42] <BillCriswell> $(location.has) === $('#word'); etc, etc
[08:15:50] <TheWhisper> but the href is to about.html, not #about
[08:16:03] <TheWhisper> I guess I could make the ids the same as the hashesh
[08:16:06] <TheWhisper> *hashes
[08:16:15] <BillCriswell> So you have #foo.html ?
[08:16:22] <TheWhisper> No
[08:16:27] <TheWhisper> I have foo.html
[08:16:42] <TheWhisper> then
[08:16:43] <TheWhisper> var toLoad = $(this).attr('href').replace('.html', '');
[08:16:46] <TheWhisper> to do the hash
[08:17:07] <Soltis> If I have an array of elements, is there a way (obviously this exact code doesn't work) to do $(el_list) and get a selector which matches just the elements in that array?
[08:17:31] <Soltis> At least, I'm fairly sure that won't work.
[08:17:48] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: You're losing me here.
[08:17:49] <shoky> Soltis: you don't get a selector, you get a jquery object wrapping those elements
[08:18:04] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, what part?
[08:18:20] <Bloomberg> Uhkis : why?
[08:18:35] <decx> Soltis so you have an array ['.stuf ,'.morestuf ] and you want to check that against a jquery object like $('div')?
[08:18:53] <aro> if yoiu move an element using draggable - is there a way to determine how many elements it moved?
[08:19:10] <BillCriswell> What does your urls look like when you click a link?
[08:19:46] <TheWhisper> site.com/index#hash
[08:20:04] <Uhkis> Bloomberg: it's impossible to tell
[08:20:16] <TheWhisper> Which is not too pretty, BillCriswell
[08:20:30] <decx> aro maybe you can save the index on the start event and compare it to the one it has in the stop event
[08:20:51] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Ok, now what is the id on the menu item that yshould be clicked if that's the hash?
[08:21:04] <TheWhisper> id='about'
[08:21:07] <TheWhisper> or whatever it is
[08:21:09] <TheWhisper> no hash
[08:21:10] <Soltis> decx: No, I have an array [HTMLInputElement, HTMLInputElement, ...]
[08:21:16] <Soltis> decx: Or something like that.
[08:21:16] <krambiorix> does anyone use MsgGrowl plugin ? How can i put html tags in the alert?
[08:21:27] <JillesMe> Soltis: means that it's an array of elements
[08:21:38] <Soltis> JillesMe: I know that.
[08:21:47] <JillesMe> Oh, good
[08:21:52] <Soltis> JillesMe: 8 < Soltis> If I have an array of elements, ...
[08:22:04] <Soltis> s/8//
[08:22:05] <JillesMe> Sorry, I just read the 'No I have an array'
[08:22:12] <Soltis> JillesMe: No prob.
[08:22:12] <BillCriswell> So for the id="about" link the hash would look like index#about right?
[08:22:14] <shoky> TheWhisper: long story short, instead of your multiple ifs you can just do  $(location.hash).click()
[08:22:22] <TheWhisper> yes
[08:22:38] <Soltis> I can always do for(var i in arr) { $(arr[i]), IIRC, but that seems sloppy.
[08:22:46] <JillesMe> What do you want to achieve Soltis
[08:23:03] <shoky> Soltis:  var jqObj = $(arr);
[08:23:03] <BillCriswell> Ok, so $(location.hash) would be that link.
[08:23:14] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, I modified your code to: http://i.imgur.com/GsLqkiO.png
[08:23:17] <BillCriswell> location.hash returns #about,
[08:23:19] <TheWhisper> And that seems to work
[08:23:20] <santiissopasse> I am using $().after() to put a button in a div after an anchor, but whenever I try to click the button it performs the click action of the div. I am already using stopPropagation() but it's not working, is there anything else I coudl do to prevent the div's action from firing?
[08:23:36] <Soltis> shoky: I'll try that again. I did try it a moment ago, but my tea hasn't kicked in yet.
[08:23:39] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Ok, there we go.
[08:23:44] <Soltis> Nor my pain killers.
[08:25:46] <shoky> santiissopasse: stopPropagation should work for that, if used correctly
[08:27:37] <TheWhisper> okay, billcriswell, now the problem is that if I actually click on one of the links
[08:27:49] <TheWhisper> it takes too long to load the page
[08:27:58] <TheWhisper> like it see the hash changes
[08:28:06] <TheWhisper> hm
[08:28:18] <TheWhisper> Oh, let's see if this works
[08:28:39] <TheWhisper> nevermind, got it
[08:30:05] <krambiorix> anyone?    does anyone use MsgGrowl plugin ? How can i put html tags in the alert?
[08:32:11] <wfx> Cork: ok it is a hack but what do you think? http://www.backalleycoder.com/2012/04/25/i-want-a-damnodeinserted/
[08:32:42] <wfx> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6997826/alternative-to-domnodeinserted
[08:32:52] <santiissopasse> shoky: I know, but its not working in this instance and I can't tell why. I'm doing this on facebook where the link is buried inside something like 11 divs and I dont know somehow one of those is interfering with this. As far as I can tell the <button> I add is last child in the tree. I can't even hover over the element with the chrome console, it won't focus on it as a button, just as a div
[08:34:38] <gordian> guys i'm coding a page which is meant to have one main image and then *several pages* of clickable thumbnails to the right, like this: http://i.imgur.com/gZsV0un.png. the thumbnails are arranged with MasonryJS and i currently have them *paged* using a flexslider. was trying to figure out an effective way to make the main image change when someone clicks a thumbnail. any suggestions?
[08:35:15] <shoky> santiissopasse: can't help without a demo
[08:36:01] <gordian> ideally the "main" image would also be a flexslider but that slider doesn't have a method to defer slide/image loading
[08:36:45] <gordian> …and the problem with adding the slides dynamically is that the slide indexes might get messed up if someone doesn't click sequential thumbnails
[08:38:30] <decx> of course flexslider has that
[08:38:45] <decx> i use the end function
[08:39:08] <decx> and before for lazyloading images
[08:39:25] <beancurd> gordian: use the thumbnails to the left as your flexslider controlnav
[08:39:36] <beancurd> gordian: http://flexslider.woothemes.com/thumbnail-controlnav.html
[08:39:57] <gordian> beancurd: the problem is that the thumbnails need to be arranged using Masonry and within their own flexslider
[08:40:07] <gordian> not sure i can do that although it would probably be ideal
[08:40:10] <beancurd> 2 flexsliders?
[08:40:27] <gordian> well there will be multiple "pages" of thumbnails
[08:40:35] <gordian> know what i mean?
[08:41:04] <gordian> hmm thnk i saw a while back something about using one flexslider to control another
[08:41:40] <gordian> decx: but what happens if someone clicks a thumbnail for a slide which has not yet loaded?
[08:43:47] <decx> i don't know enough about the ux logic of your project, but what happens if you change slider.currentSlide depending on which thumb is clicked
[08:45:00] <gordian> what do you mean, "change" it?
[08:45:08] <gordian> change the current slide on the fly?
[08:45:26] <gordian> that seems kinda jank because if someone wants to go back to a slide they already viewed then it needs to load again
[08:46:02] <decx> add some data to the slide if it's loaded then
[08:47:17] <gordian> but then the slide indexes get screwy
[08:47:59] <decx> you can increment slider.count as you please
[08:48:08] <gordian> maybe asNavFor is the solution
[08:48:13] <gordian> use one slider asNavFor another
[08:48:27] <gordian> yup that's the one
[08:48:29] <decx> i tried that once for a test, but it was a hot mess
[08:50:59] <gordian> hmm maybe i'll try that first and see what happens
[08:52:00] <decx> that's what i always do, try stuff and see what happens ^^
[08:52:52] <gordian> yeah just kinda wanted to talk out some options i guess
[09:09:07] <_biff> hi
[09:09:19] <duch_kazatel> where's marty?
[09:09:20] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:09:49] <_biff> how can i save an img src image...in the src param the png image is given as base64 data
[09:10:05] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4TTWJKsNdI Sweet Jesus.
[09:10:06] <duch_kazatel> .attr('src');
[09:10:21] <duch_kazatel> _biff, you just save it.
[09:10:23] <BillCriswell> Someone has been reading my mind.
[09:10:31] <_biff> duch_kazatel....m...
[09:10:52] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell the title of this video is worth it alone
[09:10:54] <_biff> ok im tryink..
[09:10:58] <_biff> g
[09:11:31] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i don't even know what's happening but it's beautiful.
[09:12:11] <duch_kazatel> i feel like the production level is just right, too.  a movie like this DESERVES a low budget.
[09:12:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Just how it should be.
[09:13:35] <_biff> duch_kazatel instead php would better...i have to upload...this
[09:13:37] <bobbobbins> hey, i have a bunch of nested ordered lists…is there a quick way to figure out how deeply nested one is if a user clicks on a li?
[09:13:42] <duch_kazatel> _biff huh?
[09:13:43] <_biff> duch_kazatel sorry
[09:13:55] <_biff> im thinking about this..
[09:13:58] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins depends.
[09:14:09] <_biff> duch_kazatel i have to uplload this file...
[09:14:28] <bobbobbins> duch_kazatel: whats it depend on?
[09:14:44] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins let me cook up a quick sample :)
[09:14:49] <_biff> duch_kazatel jeah but first i have to save to the disk right?:)
[09:14:52] <bobbobbins> duch_kazatel: awesome, thanks
[09:14:57] <duch_kazatel> _biff huh?
[09:15:02] <_biff> duch_kazatel:D
[09:15:07] <_biff> im just thinking loud
[09:15:51] <_biff> duch_kazatel so what i need i have to save this img and the upload to the server..
[09:16:07] <duch_kazatel> _biff just transmit the string.  that's all you need to do.
[09:16:25] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins - http://jsfiddle.net/EsrE5/ so in this case, what number are you expecting if you click on "level three"?
[09:16:35] <duch_kazatel> are you expecting 3, since that's how "deep" you are?
[09:16:38] <hxm> can I create a site with jquery ui? I mean the css part is done with jquery-ui?
[09:16:45] <bobbobbins> 2 i guess, since my array starts at 0
[09:16:54] <bobbobbins> but thats an easy fix right?
[09:17:19] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins can you clarify what you're actually doing?
[09:17:46] <_biff> duch_kazatelok but i have to find out how...im not a jquery geek:)
[09:18:09] <duch_kazatel> _biff it's a string. you'd send it like you would any other string.
[09:18:19] <_biff> duch_kazatel really?
[09:18:36] <duch_kazatel> _biff yes.  it's a base64 encoded version of the image.
[09:18:36] <_biff> so should i refer to the id of the img tag?
[09:18:41] <bobbobbins> i have an outline…and users can add to the outline…so if they want to add to a part of the outline that is nested, i need to know where, so i can create the textbox for that item
[09:18:42] <duch_kazatel> _biff huh?
[09:19:04] <bobbobbins> if that makes any sense
[09:19:16] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins like you want your markup to match your data and vice versa?
[09:19:55] <duch_kazatel> because a crude way would be this: http://jsfiddle.net/EsrE5/2/
[09:20:03] <duch_kazatel> but it sounds like you really need something like riot or backbone.
[09:20:27] <_biff> duch_kazatel so if i have the <img id="myimg" src="data:image/png;base64...."> then how should i refer to this $('#myimg').....what?
[09:20:45] <duch_kazatel> _biff $('#myimg').attr('src');
[09:20:53] <_biff> jahm
[09:22:24] <ankurk_> hxm: you can't, you would have to use something else like bootstrap in addition to jQuery UI.
[09:22:29] <_biff> duch_kazatel could i transfer this thru $.ajax post?
[09:22:47] <duch_kazatel> _biff sure.  it's a string.
[09:23:03] <_biff> aham...
[09:23:03] <duch_kazatel> _biff there is nothing that really distinguishes it much more from any other string.
[09:23:09] <bobbobbins> duch_kazatel: that probably does what i need, thanks!
[09:23:19] <bobbobbins> why do you need to stop propagation though?
[09:23:51] <hxm> i though bootstrap is something like jquery
[09:23:56] <hxm> it is focused in styles?
[09:24:01] <ilhami> Hey
[09:24:03] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins because the events bubble up - if you remove that, click on the third level will trigger three click events - one for each parent. and the specific element itself.
[09:24:09] <duch_kazatel> hxm bootstrap is more of a framework.
[09:24:15] <bobbobbins> oh i see…great, thanks!
[09:24:16] <hxm> ah
[09:24:37] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell there's that terminology again :)
[09:24:50] <ilhami> anybody here who has experience with EasyPHP?
[09:25:07] <ankurk_> & jQuery is a library to help you interact with DOM
[09:25:10] <duch_kazatel> ilhami that question is probably more appropriate for a channel about PHP
[09:25:32] <ilhami> duch_kazatel how can I change the font color of a menu item in Jquery UI?
[09:25:49] <ilhami> or of all menu items
[09:25:49] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you can use .css() to do it.
[09:25:56] <duch_kazatel> ilhami but do that using plain CSS.
[09:25:57] <ilhami> tried yesterday. Didnt work :D
[09:26:12] <ilhami> is JFiddle good for testing? :D
[09:26:16] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[09:26:17] <ilhami> JSFiddle
[09:26:18] <ilhami> *
[09:26:31] <hxm> does bootstrap use jquery?
[09:26:34] <hxm> or are hey compatible?
[09:26:49] <duch_kazatel> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> ilhami - http://jsfiddle.net/MPxKg/1/
[09:27:19] <hxm> looks like it is as its own
[09:27:24] <ilhami> sometimes I hate framworks :D but Jquery is nice.
[09:27:34] <duch_kazatel> ilhami jquery is a library, not a framework.
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> hxm i'd personally avoid boostrap.
[09:27:55] <ilhami> but it works like a framework duch_kazatel ?
[09:27:58] <ilhami> or am I wrong?
[09:28:03] <duch_kazatel> ilhami it doesn't.
[09:28:04] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: you hate bootstrap?
[09:28:13] <hxm> i just want jquery with css styles, I see those jquery-ui themes but I dont find the way to use them easyly
[09:28:32] <hxm> i was thinking about <div class="header" and get a nice default and customizable header
[09:28:35] <hxm> header menu
[09:28:37] <hxm> or anything like that
[09:28:41] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap is fine if you stick with it and don't play outside of its designated fun zone.
[09:28:51] <duch_kazatel> but once you want to move away from its way of doing things, it becomes a pain.
[09:29:15] <ilhami> stop using frameworks dude. you dont learn the real stuff :D
[09:29:18] <duch_kazatel> hxm what kind of project?
[09:29:22] <duch_kazatel> ilhami wut?
[09:29:29] <duch_kazatel> ilhami frameworks can be fantastic.
[09:29:29] <ilhami> the code behind
[09:29:32] <ilhami> :D
[09:29:40] <ilhami> it's like using a shortcut
[09:29:48] <hxm> nothing in particular, I just started with php and this could simply my life
[09:29:49] <duch_kazatel> ilhami frameworks and libraries do things for me so I don't have to worry about them.
[09:30:00] <ankurk_> Frameworks are indeed awesome, but sometimes it's fun creating your own stuff
[09:30:02] <duch_kazatel> hxm ah, then check out bootstrap or zurb foundation.
[09:30:07] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ definitely.  totally depends.
[09:30:13] <hxm> but I like jquery and I dont want to start to learn again
[09:30:20] <ilhami> jquery is nice though
[09:30:27] <hxm> the developer life is so hard :/
[09:30:31] <duch_kazatel> hxm hahahaha.
[09:30:33] <hxm> soo hard
[09:30:35] <hxm> xD
[09:30:39] <duch_kazatel> hxm it gets easier ;)
[09:30:48] <duch_kazatel> hxm there's going to be a learning curve with bootstrap, too.
[09:30:57] <duch_kazatel> and zurb - they all have their own peculiarities.
[09:31:01] <ilhami> it won't get easier :D hehe
[09:31:08] <ilhami> new techniques will occur :D
[09:31:11] <ilhami> you have to learn all the time
[09:31:43] <hxm> sure, but I like jquery, I made my first ajax with it and worked so cool that was amazed, and I get involved in projects I never think I was able to do
[09:31:45] <duch_kazatel> it's gotten easier for me over the years - i guess i just sort of learned how to use documentation well?  and i've just kind of memorized stuff
[09:31:53] <hxm> so I married with jquery
[09:32:59] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: I am bad at memorizing, may be with projects I would memorize stuff better
[09:33:09] <duch_kazatel> that's the key imo :)
[09:33:11] <duch_kazatel> do projects.
[09:33:38] <ilhami> you learn better with projects
[09:35:42] <ankurk_> I remember few days, a guy made around 180 websites in 2 days, that awesome
[09:35:45] <ankurk_> *back
[09:35:47] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:36:30] <ankurk_> yeah
[09:36:44] <ankurk_> I might be exaggerating with the number, but it was a lot
[09:37:03] <duch_kazatel> define "made", because i could "make" thousands of websites in an hour.  doesn't mean they'd be any good :)
[09:37:36] <ankurk_> actually one website for 180 consecutive days :P
[09:37:39] <ankurk_> http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180
[09:38:20] <ankurk_> I was wrong
[09:40:02] <duch_kazatel> okay, i was about to say :)
[09:40:31] <ilhami> duch_kazatel how do I change the background of the menu items when you hover+ :D
[09:40:33] <ilhami> ?
[09:41:01] <duch_kazatel> ilhami use the css :hover psuedoclass.
[09:41:16] <ilhami> so li:hover?
[09:41:20] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:41:26] <ilhami> let me try
[09:48:31] <duch_kazatel> aaand it's dead.
[09:49:01] <BillCriswell> It's always a certain type of dead in here.
[09:49:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell++
[09:50:30] <BillCriswell> I'm going to /j ##math so I can feel stupid.
[09:51:32] <BillCriswell> Quiet in there too. Dammit.
[09:51:36] <duch_kazatel> D:
[09:53:22] <BillCriswell> I just went to lunch and got a beer, ended up playing some dude in darts who was saying how he played a lot and beat him. I feel bad but why would you say you're good at something a novice can beat you at?
[09:53:50] <NoiseEee> he's setting you up for a sting next week
[09:54:00] <NoiseEee> you'll plop down $100 and he'll take it
[09:54:11] <BillCriswell> Dart sharks? Never even thought of that.
[09:54:52] <BillCriswell> He was close enough to give me the impression I was lucky... maybe he's a really good shark.
[09:54:58] <Soltis> Okay, I asked about this yesterday, but powerTip isn't viable: what's a tooltip plugin that works nicely with SVG?
[09:55:19] <Soltis> BillCriswell: That's the point. And it's sharp, not shark.
[09:55:26] <duch_kazatel> Soltis please define "nicely with svg"
[09:55:36] <BillCriswell> Soltis: Really?
[09:55:41] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: powertip, e.g., renders the tooltip behind the SVG.
[09:55:48] <BillCriswell> I thought it was a shark cause it came out from under and ate you.
[09:56:02] <BillCriswell> You're fucking with me.
[09:56:32] <duch_kazatel> Soltis are you trying to make tooltips in SVG, or....?
[09:56:40] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Either is 'correct' by common usage, but 'sharp' is the original term.
[09:56:51] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No, HTML tooltip content (at least that's what I want at the moment)
[09:56:54] <BillCriswell> A "pool sharp"?
[09:57:00] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Same idea, so sure.
[09:57:14] <duch_kazatel> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_shark
[09:57:59] <Soltis> BillCriswell: http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sharp&allowed_in_frame=0
[09:57:59] <duch_kazatel> you're thinking of "card sharp"
[09:58:01] <BillCriswell> It does say "originally pool sharp", but it comes from "card sharp"... English is stupid.
[09:58:32] <BillCriswell> Sharp seems to be someone who cheats? A shark is maybe just someone who hides that they're awesome.
[09:58:34] <Soltis> BillCriswell: The term originally meant someone cunning at pool; the term 'shark' may actually have derived indirectly from that.
[09:58:40] <Soltis> BillCriswell: For the fish, I mean.
[09:59:30] <BillCriswell> Thanks for the lesson sir.

It starts out slow but in time you can turn a good profit that is if you have the necessary patience to grow a little bit every day :P
[10:00:16] <duch_kazatel> drive-by spam?  relaly?
[10:00:34] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Of course. And personally I like the term 'sharp' better; it plays on the idea that one man's skill may be to another cheating--especially if the latter hasn't sufficient skill to see how it is being done.
[10:01:04] <Soltis> BillCriswell: (As opposed to an actual 'cheat' who would not warrant the description 'sharp')
[10:01:08] <duch_kazatel> Soltis the issue is positioning related it looks like.
[10:01:20] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: How so?
[10:01:28] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19349293/display-text-over-svg
[10:02:33] <duch_kazatel> the problem is that tooltip libs are going to require their own CSS rules irt positioning, so you're probably better just building out your own solution
[10:03:43] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Ugh. Well, one which used absolute positioning would work, it looks like.
[10:03:51] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Assuming it did the calculations properly, anyway.
[10:04:24] <duch_kazatel> Soltis powertip will do proper calculations as long as your markup doesn't have any weird funk, like position: relative; on <body>
[10:04:35] <BillCriswell> English is terrible.
[10:04:42] <Soltis> BillCriswell: No, English is amazingly cool.
[10:04:50] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Simple languages are for sissies.
[10:05:00] <BillCriswell> Do you think "Pool Shark" originated just because no one knew it was "sharp"?
[10:05:17] <BillCriswell> Maybe not english, but the phrases we use.
[10:05:32] <MikeD_> it is amazing we can communicate with english
[10:05:42] <duch_kazatel> it's a very contextual language.
[10:06:28] <Soltis> BillCriswell: I'd hazard to guess that the pronunciation wasn't as clearly delineated in the time/place where the term originated, causing a divergence eventually; the subsequent resemblance in the two words, following their respective semantical divergence, caused people who were not sure what the exact term was to become mixed up, as 'sharp' fell out of usage in that sense.
[10:07:00] <BillCriswell> Magic.
[10:07:13] <Soltis> BillCriswell: divergence in pronunciation eventually*
[10:07:30] <Soltis> BillCriswell: I think the way English mutates is fascinating and lovely.
[10:07:49] <BillCriswell> Soltis: It's cool, but if like... variables in a program stated to do that I'd be pissed.
[10:08:02] <Soltis> MikeD_: I tend to think if it amazes, then one doesn't understand language all that well. It's the imprecision which causes it to work so well.
[10:08:27] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Ever used perl? 'Cause English reminds me of perl, and vice versa. Hence perl is my fave language to write in.
[10:08:58] <giustoXricordarv>  raid della regina elisabetta 2 a roma
[10:09:30] <BillCriswell> I have used perl... seems powerful with the right type of person... I am not that type of person.
[10:09:36] <MikeD_> i think the fuzzy match of english words allows us to agree on mostly ungrounded symbols because we're really too busy to be any more distinct or otherwise appreciate nuance
[10:10:37] <Soltis> BillCriswell: I'm one of those bastards who writes line-noise perl and thinks it's EASIER to read than verbose crap.
[10:10:39] <vol4ko> i am noob in this, but how can i include this plugin in my website? like the button Pop it up. I loaded the script, but don't know how to use the code, anyone can help me please http://dinbror.dk/bpopup/
[10:11:10] <BillCriswell> vol4ko: Did you read Step 1?
[10:11:13] <MikeD_> one of my friends was trying to suggest that all those fancy-big words we learned are of no use because there are always simpler versions that work just as well - the irony is that he wouldn't understand the reference to Newspeak if i'd made it
[10:11:24] <Soltis> MikeD_: Sigh.
[10:11:26] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:11:39] <Soltis> MikeD_: You just gave me a reason to drink today.
[10:11:49] <MikeD_> you need a reason? :p
[10:11:55] <Soltis> MikeD_: No, BUT IT SURE HELPS
[10:12:01] <Soltis> :D
[10:12:10] <BillCriswell> I think I just put a folder dead center of my desktop. That was awesome.
[10:12:17] <BillCriswell> Couldn't do it again if I tried.
[10:12:21] <vol4ko> BillCriswell: this is it  $('element_to_pop_up').bPopup(); but dont know how can i use it
[10:12:35] <BillCriswell> vol4ko: It's literally just that.
[10:12:43] <santiissopasse> shoky: so I think whats happening is that stopPropagation isnt working bc the element receiving the click is the sibling of an ancestor, but not necessarily in the ancestry line, would that make sense?
[10:12:57] <BillCriswell> <script src="path/to/plugin"></script> <script> $('element_to_pop_up').bPopup(); </script>
[10:13:54] <vol4ko> i did it, but how can i show the Pop it up blue button
[10:14:08] <Soltis> MikeD_: Tell your friend that until he understands the difference between spontaneous and impromptu he doesn't know English.
[10:14:46] <BillCriswell> I actually think I know that.
[10:15:22] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[10:15:50] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Would putting the svg inside an absolutely positioned div break powertip?
[10:16:05] <duch_kazatel> Soltis it shouldn't.
[10:16:15] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Huh. 'Cause it is breaking rather nastily.
[10:16:16] <MikeD_> isn't that an easy thing to test?
[10:16:32] <duch_kazatel> Soltis what's your positioning on the parent div?
[10:16:45] <duch_kazatel> or containers?
[10:16:59] <duch_kazatel> like, you're not setting position: relative; on body, right?
[10:17:03] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: top: 100px; left: 20px; right: 20px; bottom: 20px; #Yes, this actually does what you'd think.
[10:17:12] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No other positioning, IIRC.
[10:17:23] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: On any other containers, I mean.
[10:17:33] <duch_kazatel> and no reset styles or anything like that?
[10:17:40] <duch_kazatel> because withgout seeing it in action, it's hard to help.
[10:17:51] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Well, if it 'should' work, then I can hopefully figure out why it isn't.
[10:18:02] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I just don't want to bother if it's bunk in the first place.
[10:18:23] <Soltis> MikeD_: Dammit. I forgot I took tylenol. Let's hope one shot doesn't eat my liver away entirely.
[10:18:34] <MikeD_> you'll be fine
[10:18:51] <Soltis> MikeD_: I know, but I forget every so often. IT's not a good combination, though it feels interesting.
[10:18:56] <BillCriswell> I thought position on body was relative by default?
[10:19:01] <duch_kazatel> it isn't bunk.  the dude used to work on supporting tooltips on 3rd party sites all the time, so he knows what he's doing.
[10:19:02] <shoky> santiissopasse: stopPropagation works only if one element is inside another
[10:19:34] <Soltis> MikeD_: Alcohol causes one to metabolise acetamenophin faster than the liver can handle, so you get the (neurologic) impact of taking a LOT more tylenol, plus a small amount of liver damage.
[10:19:35] <BillCriswell> Hm, guess not.
[10:19:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what would it be relative to?
[10:19:51] <santiissopasse> shoky: right, so is there a way to stop all other elements in the dom from firing? Also it seems that this sibling element is blocking the button so I never actually click on the button. Any ideas?
[10:19:55] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:19:59] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I meant the situation I'm trying to deal with, not powertip itself.
[10:20:06] <shoky> santiissopasse: like i said, can't help without a demo
[10:20:09] <duch_kazatel> Soltis hrm.
[10:20:20] <duch_kazatel> Soltis kind of stuck then.
[10:20:32] <santiissopasse> shoky: the demo won't help unless you're willing to install an entire chrome extension
[10:20:37] <santiissopasse> otherwise jquery wont work on FB
[10:20:39] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Given: absolute positioning of immediate parent div; no other positioning stipulated up to <body>
[10:20:58] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Assuming that's correct, this "should" work, yes? If so, I just have to figure out what's tampering with my page.
[10:21:02] <shoky> santiissopasse no thanks. but you can try reproducing the issue on jsfiddle
[10:21:08] <duch_kazatel> Soltis it should, sure.
[10:21:14] <santiissopasse> shoky: I can show some code and take a screenshot of my console so you can see the dom tree, if that helps
[10:21:14] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Thanks.
[10:21:24] <shoky> santiissopasse: better than nothing..
[10:22:44] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Looking at the computed CSS attributes seems to confirm my hypothesis.
[10:23:07] <duch_kazatel> Soltis i can't really be of much more help without seeing some code at this point.  sorry.
[10:25:10] <santiissopasse> shoky, can you recommend a place to paste images quickly?
[10:25:20] <duch_kazatel> imgur
[10:25:22] <shoky> santiissopasse: imgur.com
[10:27:57] <duch_kazatel> this waiting game for my promotion is killing me.
[10:28:21] <shoky> you're sure to win
[10:28:28] <duch_kazatel> D:
[10:28:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: How long have you been waiting?
[10:28:57] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: It's alright. I'll figure this out. Eventually.
[10:29:04] <duch_kazatel> a few weeks.  the paperwork is taking some time.
[10:29:17] <duch_kazatel> like, they've said they're going to do it.
[10:29:22] <duch_kazatel> and i believe them.
[10:29:58] <BillCriswell> but at the same time it feels like maybe you shouldn't be believing them?
[10:30:02] <santiissopasse> shoky: http://i.imgur.com/36Hv25z.jpg https://dpaste.de/3yT9
[10:30:30] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily that.  my company is great.  pay is good, they treat us well, lots of great perks.  just makes me wonder wtf is taking so long.
[10:30:33] <santiissopasse> shoky: the button thats highlighted is the one I want to click, the <a> tag that's a sibling with the containing div is what's being fired
[10:31:01] <duch_kazatel> we have like one HR dude who takes care of these kinds of paperwork for 450+ employees.  i think maybe he's just busy?
[10:31:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's plenty fair then.
[10:31:35] <duch_kazatel> aye.  just kills me having to wait.
[10:32:02] <BillCriswell> What will your new official title be?
[10:32:37] <duch_kazatel> Sernior Developer.
[10:32:44] <duch_kazatel> *Senior
[10:32:55] <BillCriswell> Mr. Developer?
[10:32:56] <thang__> señor
[10:33:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm going to demand business cards and have the title be "Señor Developer"
[10:33:29] <duch_kazatel> because that's awesome.
[10:33:37] <BillCriswell> I do like that.
[10:33:55] <BillCriswell> I wanted to get some made up that had "Noted Expert" as my title.
[10:34:14] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:37:37] <ilhami> duch_kazatel
[10:39:00] <shoky> santiissopasse: seems like that <a> is styled to be in front of the sibling <div> or something like that. it has position:absolute, left/right/top/bottom: 0
[10:39:13] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you can just ask questions.  no need to ping me ;)_
[10:39:29] <santiissopasse> shoky: so how can I get around that?
[10:39:38] <ilhami> http://fpaste.org/91392/65466821/ look. why does that not work?
[10:39:52] <ilhami> I tried to put the menu <ul> in another file and include it?
[10:40:14] <shoky> santiissopasse: you could remove it, restyle it, or handle clicks on the <a>
[10:40:22] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/ but I'm getting an empty string...
[10:40:50] <santiissopasse> shoky: is there any way to just style the button to have it be in front? Z-index?
[10:41:06] <shoky> santiissopasse: you can try giving a high z-index to the <div>
[10:41:41] <shoky> santiissopasse: the <div> thats sibling of the <a>  that is
[10:41:55] <duch_kazatel> ilhami can you make a fiddle instead?
[10:42:19] <ilhami> yes two second. but I can't use php in fiddle, can I+
[10:42:27] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:42:46] <ilhami> :S
[10:43:20] <duch_kazatel> use the rendered html instead.
[10:44:34] <duch_kazatel> ilhami that example would have been useless to me anyway - i can't see the html you're trying to apply things to.
[10:45:08] <ilhami> hm 2 sec
[10:45:16] <shoky> santiissopasse: oh since its a chrome extension i gues you don't need cross browser support, you can put pointer-events: none;  on the <a>
[10:45:49] <santiissopasse> shoky: I just removed the <a> and that seemd to work without breaking the UX
[10:45:52] <shoky> santiissopasse: er though that would also disable any click functionality you do want on that link, looks to be a youtube link
[10:46:02] <shoky> cool
[10:46:24] <santiissopasse> shoky: there's links inside, theres just a link over the entire div too, I guess for sloppy clickers
[10:46:40] <santiissopasse> shoky: what does top, bottom, left, right: 0 do?
[10:47:05] <shoky> stretches it to its containers size
[10:47:32] <shoky> its top is 0 px from the top of its container, its bottom is 0 from the bottom, etc
[10:48:27] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I think the php is not getting included before the rest of the code is executed
[10:48:32] <ilhami> my menu isn't shown
[10:48:36] <duch_kazatel> ilhami huh
[10:48:38] <duch_kazatel> ?
[10:48:45] <duch_kazatel> ilhami so the menu isn't on the page?
[10:48:54] <ilhami> yeah I put the <ul> </ul> menu in another file and tried to include it
[10:49:03] <ilhami> while my css and jquery is in the file where I include it
[10:49:14] <duch_kazatel> ilhami and the html doesn't render at all?
[10:49:28] <ilhami> yep. Doesn't render
[10:49:32] <ilhami> checking firebug
[10:49:34] <ilhami> not even there
[10:49:46] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need ot get help in a php channel then.
[10:50:09] <ilhami> I am banned :D
[10:50:19] <duch_kazatel> ... why?
[10:50:21] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[10:50:40] <shoky> manners. he often lacks them
[10:50:48] <ilhami> do you even know me ?
[10:51:02] <duch_kazatel> ilhami apparently not.  bummer for you!
[10:51:07] <shoky> i've seen you on irc.. does that count?
[10:51:16] <ilhami> no it doesn't count.
[10:51:34] <shoky> anyway i didn't say always. no complaints here
[10:53:49] <santiissopasse> shoky: ok removing the<a> did the trick and doesnt seem to change the site too much. thanks a lot for the help
[10:54:04] <shoky> np santiissopasse
[10:54:29] <TheWhisper> I can't get this bind listeners to work for some reason :(
[10:54:54] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper what's the listener?
[10:55:08] <TheWhisper> sec
[10:56:06] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/bekuqabi/1/edit
[10:56:33] <TheWhisper> It runs through it all fine in the debug console, but then when I click on the actual element, nothing happens
[10:56:49] <duch_kazatel> which one?  $('.menuButton').on('click', 'a', function() { ?
[10:58:04] <TheWhisper> Yes
[10:58:12] <duch_kazatel> does the console log run?
[10:58:12] <ilhami> works now duch_kazatel :D
[10:58:25] <TheWhisper> No
[10:58:39] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, I pasted in the HTML too: http://jsbin.com/bekuqabi/2/edit
[10:58:49] <ilhami> you know what was the problem ? :D
[10:59:19] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper does .menuButton get ajax'd in or replaced or anything like that?
[10:59:29] <TheWhisper> By another function? no
[10:59:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:59:41] <TheWhisper> ?
[10:59:45] <TheWhisper> It's in the index.html file
[10:59:46] <duch_kazatel> does it happen at all is what i'm asking?
[10:59:49] <TheWhisper> so it's always there
[10:59:55] <TheWhisper> It doesn't come in later
[10:59:58] <TheWhisper> if that's what you mean
[11:00:00] <duch_kazatel> and doesn't get re-written or anything?
[11:00:22] <ilhami> duch_kazatel the problem was I didnt access the file with localhost but with the ///file name :D
[11:00:42] <duch_kazatel> ilhami ah.  good times.
[11:01:27] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:01:28] <TheWhisper> oh
[11:01:32] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:01:57] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, am I not actually calling the function when I click somehow?
[11:02:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:02:22] <TheWhisper> nevermind
[11:02:27] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:02:58] <duch_kazatel> delegated listeners are simple, so i'm not sure what you're talking about.
[11:03:22] <TheWhisper> Okay, the click function itself runs fine if I remove all the extraneous stuff and put it in the document.ready
[11:03:33] <TheWhisper> I think somehow it's losing the listener
[11:03:35] <duch_kazatel> are you binding that listener in a doc ready?
[11:03:50] <duch_kazatel> the listener can only bind to something that exists.
[11:03:58] <TheWhisper> Yes, I know
[11:04:03] <duch_kazatel> so make sure you running youir bidning in a doc ready.
[11:04:11] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:05:11] <TheWhisper> Ah, okay
[11:05:29] <TheWhisper> Duch_kazatel, the running of the checkSize() function was not in doc ready
[11:05:43] <duch_kazatel> checksize isn't binding anything is it?
[11:06:07] <TheWhisper> like .bind(X)?
[11:06:13] <duch_kazatel> or .on()
[11:06:19] <TheWhisper> no
[11:06:34] <duch_kazatel> okay - then why would that code matter to the listener you're talking about?
[11:06:50] <TheWhisper> I don't know, but moving it into the doc ready fixed the listener
[11:07:18] <duch_kazatel> then you've got something else going on.
[11:08:07] <TheWhisper> I showed you all the code
[11:08:14] <TheWhisper> so dunno what else it would've been lol
[11:08:33] <duch_kazatel> function checkSize() calls fancyMobileNav(), which runs the binding.
[11:08:41] <duch_kazatel> when are you running checkSize()?
[11:08:47] <TheWhisper> yes
[11:09:03] <TheWhisper> I am now running it in doc ready
[11:09:23] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i get it - this is for a mobile thing, yeah?>
[11:09:29] <TheWhisper> yes
[11:09:29] <duch_kazatel> use media queries for that instead.
[11:10:12] <BillCriswell> I'm feeling like an idiot. How do you trigger a drag event in jQuery ui?
[11:10:20] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, why?
[11:11:05] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper because that's the smart way to do responsive siutes?
[11:11:15] <duch_kazatel> don't tie your styling to your javascript like that.
[11:11:27] <TheWhisper> You mean in case the mobile browser doesn't have JS?
[11:11:36] <duch_kazatel> no
[11:11:45] <duch_kazatel> you're not giving yourself proper separations of concern.
[11:12:07] <TheWhisper> As far as I can tell, you can't do an off canvas menu without jquery
[11:12:43] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're doing, but running a size check and then binding events like that feels awkward to me.
[11:12:53] <TheWhisper> I'm trying to get an off canvas menu
[11:13:13] <duch_kazatel> "off canvas menu" meaning...?
[11:13:22] <TheWhisper> http://christopheryee.ca/pushy/
[11:13:23] <TheWhisper> like that
[11:13:28] <TheWhisper> click the top menu button
[11:13:39] <TheWhisper> Maybe I'll just use that
[11:13:50] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with a canvast.
[11:13:54] <duch_kazatel> *canvas.
[11:14:06] <TheWhisper> http://jasonweaver.name/lab/offcanvas/
[11:14:14] <TheWhisper> I didn't make up the name
[11:14:42] <duch_kazatel> okay, that's what you're talking about.
[11:14:50] <TheWhisper> Yes, an off canvas menu
[11:14:52] <TheWhisper> :P
[11:15:52] <duch_kazatel> i woulda just done an animated width on it.
[11:16:53] <TheWhisper> I was eventually going to do something like that
[11:28:14] <BillCriswell> Damn, transitions don't play well with draggables.
[11:32:34] <BillCriswell> Does toggleClass remove classes than decide to add it back or keep it removed?
[11:35:40] <BillCriswell> How would I get this smoother and how would I programatically trigger a drag so it starts off upside down? http://jsbin.com/gafuxuju/3/edit?js,output
[11:36:08] <duch_kazatel> .trigger() doesn't work?
[11:36:29] <BillCriswell> Nope. =(
[11:36:54] <BillCriswell> I guess I'd need to use translate to get it smoother.
[11:37:11] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: that's some cool shit
[11:37:33] <duch_kazatel> ooooh neat.
[11:38:04] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: We're building something for a table top at some point I imagine ( someone came down and asked me if it's doable so I had to try it ).
[11:39:56] <BillCriswell> I might not be able to use jQuery UI for this in particular. =(
[11:40:58] <sara1392> who are can speak persian?
[11:41:15] <sara1392> i have a problem
[11:41:40] <sara1392> i can not well speack engilish
[11:41:53] <BillCriswell> Your english seems better than most natives so I might just try it out in english sara1392.
[11:42:21] <ankurk_> We always underestimate ourselves :P
[11:44:06] <sara1392> no i really cant not well speack engilish
[11:44:09] <MikeD_> you speak better english than we can speak persian, can you make a code example on jsfiddle.net ?
[11:45:41] <sara1392> MikeD_, yes please wait
[11:47:32] <BillCriswell> Hmm... $elements.each() is causing jsbin to throw security errors?
[11:47:57] <CrowX-> Cork, you there?
[11:50:05] <CrowX-> My site works prefectly well in chrome and firefox, but when I open it in ie9 crazy stuff are happening, and ie9's console shows no errors. How can I make it work in ie9 well too?
[11:52:54] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- what are the issues?
[11:54:07] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- you might be using something that is not compatible with IE9.
[11:54:22] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, in ie9 the main image doesn't show, and the menu goes totally crazy. on hover it starts moving like john travolta on drugs
[11:54:31] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see it.
[11:54:38] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, http://whatishacking.org/rach
[11:55:18] <duch_kazatel> you're alinging things all weird.  IE11 is having problems, too.
[11:57:03] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, give me an example of a thing I do badly
[11:57:09] <CrowX-> so I could get on track about fixing things
[12:01:12] <duch_kazatel> your first menu-row is 444px tall.
[12:01:39] <duch_kazatel> when you mouse out, it looks like it's expanding to fill the browser - your plugin is likely the problem.
[12:03:07] <ankurk_> Well, I think it's simple, but I want to exclude <h4> tag. How would i do it?
[12:03:24] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ hrm?
[12:03:53] <ankurk_> I have a h4 tag in a span, and I want to get the text in that span excluding h4 tag.
[12:04:00] <ilhami> how to override a margin on .ui-menu
[12:04:01] <ilhami> ?
[12:04:05] <ilhami> it doesn't really work when I do
[12:04:14] <ankurk_> .not('h4') doesn't seem to work.
[12:04:20] <ankurk_> ilhami: .css?
[12:04:25] <ilhami> I tried.
[12:04:34] <duch_kazatel> ilhami margin: 0px; ?
[12:04:37] <ilhami> it works in one page but not in the other page.
[12:04:44] <ilhami> that's so weird.
[12:04:49] <ilhami> and it's the same style.
[12:04:50] <duch_kazatel> ilhami make sure you're including everything.
[12:05:09] <ankurk_> .not() and :not both doesn't seem to work for me
[12:05:31] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ you might need to run a replace() on the final string to remove the text from the h4?
[12:08:02] <duch_kazatel> though that feels dirty.
[12:08:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7NWAr/1/
[12:08:28] <duch_kazatel> you could also walk the text nodes.
[12:10:46] <vldcnst> http://paste.ee/p/J5aKS - I'm trying to see which (or at least see how many) elements (the 4 divs, in the ex) are inside which table cells, without selecting every possible div and calculating coordinates/comparing to coordinates of the table
[12:11:32] <vacho> please help me with line 27...how do I call a object outside the function? http://pastebin.com/cXcQYLTb
[12:11:37] <vacho> ajpiano:  :)
[12:14:46] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, any idea why the menu-row would be 444px in ie when it's set to be 95px when #menu is hovered, and $(item).height() when not. Also why it would work in chrome and ff but not in ie?
[12:17:49] <BillCriswell> If you're doing something with a lot of drag and drop and some animations will be involved might it be better performance wise to use canvas?
[12:19:38] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- inconsistencies in how browsers do things, obviously.  not terribly sure - just pointing you in a direction.
[12:20:00] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what would you do if you were in my place?
[12:20:39] <duch_kazatel> i would pull out a step debugger and use it.
[12:20:54] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what's a step debugger?
[12:21:11] <duch_kazatel> a debugger that lets you step through code.
[12:21:22] <duch_kazatel> which browser are you using>?
[12:21:49] <duch_kazatel> actually, since IE is your problem, what OS are you on?
[12:22:08] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, chrome
[12:22:22] <CrowX-> chromium
[12:22:23] <Brycetron> duch_kazatel, what's up? :D
[12:22:45] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- ... what go read up about IE's dev tools.
[12:22:52] <duch_kazatel> heyo Brycetron.
[12:23:18] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, OS is linux
[12:23:37] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- go read up on IE's developer tools and learn how to use the javascript debugger.
[12:24:28] <Kamuela> Anyone here use an IDE beyond something Sublime?
[12:24:54] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, you mean the console?
[12:26:45] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- yes.   there is a debugger in IE. i'd upgrade to 11 and go from there.
[12:26:48] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela for javascript?
[12:27:18] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: Yeah
[12:27:29] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela javascript doesn't really lend itself to an IDE imo.
[12:27:56] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: well, web development does with html/css/js and now js server-side
[12:28:36] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela not in my opinion, but some people really like...
[12:28:44] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember the name.  websomethignorother.
[12:29:36] <duch_kazatel> there was one that did live previews in it that didn't suck, too.
[12:29:42] <duch_kazatel> lighttable i think it was?
[12:31:49] <ilhami> is it possible to make tables with JQuery?
[12:32:00] <ilhami> or should I use html?
[12:32:12] <duch_kazatel> ilhami can you make them ahead of time?
[12:32:34] <ilhami> huh?
[12:32:48] <duch_kazatel> ilhami why do you think you need to use javascript to make them?
[12:33:08] <ilhami> just curious if it's possible.
[12:33:18] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you can do it, though I'
[12:33:31] <duch_kazatel> *i'd a) avoid tables, and b) do it in raw html if possible instead.
[12:34:07] <ilhami> duch_kazatel what is the alternative? what does wordpress use for their list of posts?
[12:34:18] <ilhami> isn't that a table? or am I completely wrong?
[12:34:30] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you could use divs, sections, articles, a ul...
[12:35:10] <ilhami> sections and articles, do all browsers support them?
[12:35:20] <duch_kazatel> those are html5.
[12:35:41] <ilhami> yeah I think not all browsers support 'em
[12:35:46] <duch_kazatel> !caniuse
[12:35:59] <duch_kazatel> http://caniuse.com/html5semantic
[12:36:36] <ilhami> most browsers support them :D
[12:36:59] <ilhami> Opera really sucks huh ? :D
[12:37:29] <duch_kazatel> opera recently switched to the same rendering engine as chrome.
[12:37:34] <ilhami> oh :D
[12:37:41] <duch_kazatel> they were also one of the most standards compliant browsers for a while.
[12:38:09] <ilhami> IE has really improved. What do you think?
[12:38:15] <duch_kazatel> i agree.
[12:38:24] <duch_kazatel> 11 is a fantastic browser imo.
[12:38:37] <ilhami> are you a Microsoft user?
[12:38:42] <slax0r> get out
[12:38:43] <slax0r> get out now
[12:38:45] <ilhami> :D
[12:38:52] <duch_kazatel> "a microsoft user"?
[12:38:55] <ilhami> Windows*
[12:38:56] <sacrebleu> what is default timeout for $.ajax
[12:38:56] <duch_kazatel> i use windows, if that's what you mean.
[12:39:13] <slax0r> *facepalm*
[12:39:15] <dougb_> is it possible to detect when an iframe begins loading vs when it ends loading? i know I can do $('iframe').load() and run an event once it's finished loading the page
[12:39:16] <ilhami> duch_kazatel Microsft = Windows hehe
[12:39:36] <ilhami> dougb_ can't you use a callback function?
[12:39:45] <duch_kazatel> ilhami they want to know when it starts.
[12:39:52] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu wut
[12:40:13] <ilhami> oh
[12:40:17] <ilhami> I misread
[12:40:17] <sacrebleu> duch_kazatel: $.ajax() has a timeout limiter, what is its default value?  https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:40:44] <dougb_> ilhami: i could do a callback function possibly with postMessage when a user clicks on a link, so the parent knows programatically when it starts loading, but 99% of the domains i'm dealing w/ I don't have access to their source
[12:41:28] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu the docs say there is no default, so there isn't one.
[12:41:42] <sacrebleu> there must be one otherwise it would be 0 which would be no transaction
[12:41:51] <duch_kazatel> 0 is there is no timeout.
[12:42:22] <ilhami> LOL
[12:43:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm serious - that's not meant to be funny.  jquery by itself has no limit.
[12:43:05] <duch_kazatel> if you want to set one, you have that option.
[12:43:58] <duch_kazatel> today's awesome error - SCRIPT28: Out of stack space
[12:44:34] <sacrebleu> duch_kazatel: where does it say that in the docs, duch_kazatel
[12:44:37] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I just laughed at he insisted on there was a limit :D
[12:45:31] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: If this actually works, I'm thinking qtip2 is WAY better than powertip
[12:45:44] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu it doesn't provide a default value, which means that there isn't one.
[12:45:54] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu i can go dump through the codebase.
[12:45:59] <duch_kazatel> Soltis for your purposes sure.
[12:46:31] <sacrebleu> did not seem to fix the problem i am having
[12:46:38] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu what problem are you having?
[12:46:40] <sacrebleu> $.ajax() times out when sending >5mb post data
[12:46:52] <duch_kazatel> sacrebleu ajax isn't your problem there.  the browser/server are.
[12:47:01] <sacrebleu> browser is chrome server is wamp
[12:47:02] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: All-round, really. Still evaluating function, but in terms of API/features/design philosophy qtip2 seems way, way better.
[12:47:24] <duch_kazatel> Soltis i know the guy who build powertip, so i'm going to be inclined to disagree either way ;)
[12:47:27] <sacrebleu> php is set to higher post_max_size and file upload size already
[12:48:51] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Sentimental, I see.
[12:49:06] <duch_kazatel> and my company uses it whenever we need tooltip.s
[12:49:16] <duch_kazatel> we found it better for our purposes than anything else out there.
[12:49:19] <duch_kazatel> it's fine to disagree :)
[12:49:34] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Haha, sure. And this is assuming this actually works how I think it does. I'm still evaluating.
[12:50:26] <ilhami> duch_kazatel how would a format a div horizontally to look nice?
[12:50:33] <acidjazz> ask your mom
[12:50:34] <ilhami> I mean have more values than one? or would I have more divs?
[12:50:58] <ilhami> would I have a div for each value from the database?
[12:51:06] <duch_kazatel> ilhami wut?
[12:51:13] <duch_kazatel> ilhami google it.
[12:51:34] <ilhami> gonna get some products from a database which I am going to list
[12:51:40] <ilhami> you said use divs
[12:51:49] <duch_kazatel> what are you "listing"
[12:51:59] <ilhami> product name, description etc.
[12:52:09] <duch_kazatel> so it's a list of information?
[12:52:14] <ilhami> yes
[12:52:26] <duch_kazatel> you could use a <ul> for lists of informationm.
[12:52:32] <duch_kazatel> that would be semantically correct.
[12:53:10] <ilhami> hmm
[12:53:33] <MikeD_> if your data comes from a database table, isn't <table> semantically correct?
[12:53:37] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:53:45] <duch_kazatel> please dear god no.
[12:53:45] <sara1392> MikeD_, dont put in jsfiddle
[12:54:12] <ilhami> duch_kazatel so I have to use <ul> and modify it with css to list horizontally?
[12:54:23] <duch_kazatel> ilhami that's one way to do it, yes
[12:54:46] <ilhami> I need a nice header.
[12:54:47] <sara1392> MikeD_,  dont put jsfiddle
[12:55:00] <ilhami> sara1392 ?????
[12:55:12] <duch_kazatel> sara1392 you mean you can't put it in a fiddle?
[12:56:01] <sara1392> yes becuse my problem is in slice of project
[12:56:18] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone has used Leaflet map plugin? I implented this library on a drupal module to render a map on node, but it crash all page. If I comment a specific line, the map looks fine, bu with the line, crashes. Any help please?
[12:56:27] <sara1392> i cant not put jsfiddle
[12:56:43] <duch_kazatel> sara1392 then it will be hard to help - try describing the problem.
[12:57:16] <sara1392> sorry i can not well speak engilish :(
[12:57:27] <duch_kazatel> sara1392 then how do you expect us to help?
[12:57:46] <MikeD_> sara1392: you have to make a simple version in fiddle so we can see _only_ the problem
[12:58:19] <ilhami> duch_kazatel should I surround the <ul> with a <div> as well?
[12:58:19] <ilhami> :)
[12:58:29] <sara1392> if who can speack pearsion
[12:58:46] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i have no idea what your layout is like, so i cannot answer that question.
[12:58:46] <ilhami> pearsion?
[12:58:52] <slax0r> persian probably
[12:58:57] <ilhami> farsi?
[12:59:06] <ilhami> I can speak Kurdish if that helps haha
[12:59:09] <duch_kazatel> persion
[12:59:13] <duch_kazatel> *persian
[12:59:19] <sara1392> i can speack persion
[12:59:21] <sara1392> farci
[12:59:30] <MikeD_> i'm afraid to even look at farsi
[12:59:39] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I can surround with a div and then display:inline? right?
[12:59:52] <duch_kazatel> ilhami you can do that on the UL.
[12:59:56] <duch_kazatel> why do you think to need the div?>
[12:59:57] <ilhami> h
[12:59:57] <sara1392> mikau, why?
[13:00:00] <ilhami> oh
[13:00:00] <MikeD_> ilhami: isn't an inline div a span?
[13:00:17] <macscam1> can anyone help me debug a little problem with infowindows not showing up on a google maps api project https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9961682
[13:00:18] <ilhami> found an example on google where they surrounded with a div. Probably a bad one then
[13:00:33] <slax0r> sara1392: try to use http://translate.google.com
[13:00:48] <slax0r> and on that note, I'm out :)
[13:00:50] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i have no idea what you're trying to do, sooo....
[13:00:51] <slax0r> buhbai!
[13:01:11] <ilhami> duch_kazatel I am trying to make a list of all products from my database like wordpress displays all posts :)
[13:01:21] <ilhami> have you used wordpress before?
[13:01:24] <duch_kazatel> ilhami i do not know what your layout will look like.
[13:01:36] <duch_kazatel> i have seen many wordpress sites. they often look different.
[13:01:37] <ilhami> me neither :D I am just trying.
[13:02:00] <ilhami> no no I am talking about the admin pages
[13:02:08] <ilhami> wp-admin
[13:02:10] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:02:17] <ilhami> wait 2 sec.
[13:02:49] <duch_kazatel> ilhami do you have any on-topic questions?
[13:02:58] <duch_kazatel> or are you going to just ask simple css questions?
[13:02:58] <ilhami> they will come.
[13:04:38] <ilhami> duch_kazatel: you see this? http://www.gracefulpenguin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wordpress-posts-page.jpg
[13:04:52] <ilhami> I want it like this.
[13:05:00] <duch_kazatel> still not on topic man.
[13:05:33] <ilhami> ok just tell me what they used to make this :D did they do it with <ul> like you suggested?
[13:05:42] <duch_kazatel> i don't know - still not on topic.
[13:05:50] <ilhami> let me ask in #css
[13:05:55] <ilhami> bbl
[13:09:56] <therealklanni> What's up guys?!
[13:10:05] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[13:10:10] <hxm> hello, I am seriously planing to use a framework for my sites, I dont want a wordpress, I want a suite with standard css or jquery as javascript
[13:10:14] <hxm> exists something like that?
[13:10:21] <therealklanni> ##javascript is being flooded with politics... so yeah, hi :D
[13:10:44] <duch_kazatel> therealklanni i gave up on that channel a long time ago.  i watch it but don't participate much any more.
[13:10:49] <duch_kazatel> hxm huh?
[13:11:01] <hxm> something like bootstrap, but with jquery
[13:11:08] <therealklanni> Bootstrap uses jQuery
[13:11:09] <duch_kazatel> hxm you can use the two together.
[13:11:14] <Jattenalle> so, as we were saying before therealklanni so rudely interrupted.. i think Mitt Romney is the superior choice for the NWO government
[13:11:21] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle :)
[13:11:24] <Jattenalle> i mean, who else is going to fight the chemtrail moon giants?
[13:11:33] <hxm> is made with jquery? oh, you made my day, thanks
[13:11:34] <therealklanni> duch_kazatel: not "can" jQuery is a requirement (if you want to use any of the components)
[13:11:48] <therealklanni> Jattenalle: *rage*
[13:11:49] <therealklanni> :P
[13:11:54] <Jattenalle> :)
[13:11:59] <duch_kazatel> therealklanni i've only ever used bootstrap's grid system.
[13:12:17] <duch_kazatel> also, they were in here asking the exact same thing earlier, so i was rephrasing my answer from before.
[13:12:31] <therealklanni> Yeah, that's what I mean, if that's all your after is the basic layout and styling stuff, sure, but anything else requires jquery
[13:12:40] <therealklanni> ok :)
[13:18:24] <mmun> does anyone have experiencing running a qunit suite in node (without phantomjs)? would you recommend using node-qunit?
[13:28:23] <NaN> is it safer to use fadeIn to a div wrapper with 1000 elems, than do a css transition (same wrapper) from alpha 0 to 1?
[13:29:36] <BillCriswell> NaN: What do you mean by safer?
[13:29:59] <NaN> BillCriswell: "better"
[13:30:14] <NaN> I want to hide all my content until all the DOM is ready
[13:31:04] <BillCriswell> The transition would get you better performance, but it's probably more cross browser safe to use fadeI.n
[13:31:33] <BillCriswell> I keep stopping myself from saying "but watch out for users with JS not turned on".
[13:32:59] <decx> there are dozens of us! dozens !
[13:33:29] <BillCriswell> decx: Probably my favorite quote from arrested development.
[13:33:56] <decx> mine is: have you even ever seen a chicken?
[13:34:00] <NaN> BillCriswell: ok, I'll go with opacity and transition, thanks :)
[13:34:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah - all two of them will have a hard time without that javascript.
[13:34:31] <duch_kazatel> welp, looks like the dude behind opencart is having a meltdown: https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/1286
[13:34:49] <BillCriswell> I'm shocked someone in here isn't like "Well, I don't have javascript enabled."
[13:34:59] <BillCriswell> "Well, you are an asshole."
[13:35:14] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it's #jquery, so there's a bias.
[13:35:31] <decx> mainly to feel smug when i encounter a big page with bad degredation
[13:35:41] <decx> *i totally would have put a fallback there*
[13:35:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's fine.
[13:36:01] <duch_kazatel> don't do stupid shit.
[13:36:07] <duch_kazatel> expect that ajax call to fail, etc.
[13:36:20] <BillCriswell> Yeah, .no-js .whatIPlannedToFadeIn { display: block; }
[13:36:27] <duch_kazatel> haha
[13:36:32] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[13:36:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Why is he having a melt down?
[13:37:20] <duch_kazatel> he didn't include the license OR attribution for some code he reused from mozilla.
[13:37:24] <duch_kazatel> somebody called him out on it.
[13:37:39] <BillCriswell> Ohhhh
[13:37:46] <BillCriswell> Why wouldn't he do that?
[13:37:54] <duch_kazatel> because he thinks he doesn't have to.
[13:37:55] <BillCriswell> Er, why would.
[13:38:04] <duch_kazatel> he decided to flip out and tell them to "fuck off".  etc.  somebody even submitted a PR that fixes it by adding back in the license.
[13:38:06] <BillCriswell> ... did my correction even make sense.
[13:38:20] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: So he's crying over some comments?
[13:38:21] <duch_kazatel> why would he not attribute it correctly?  who knows.
[13:38:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah basically.
[13:38:33] <duch_kazatel> and mozilla is coming after him iirc
[13:38:34] <BillCriswell> People are weird.
[13:38:58] <BillCriswell> Think they'd really do anything or just like "put the license in there, doofus"
[13:38:58] <NoiseEee> he resigned.
[13:39:11] <duch_kazatel> oh he did?
[13:39:12] <BillCriswell> The open cart guy?
[13:39:13] <NoiseEee> my bad
[13:39:14] <NoiseEee> lol
[13:39:17] <NoiseEee> too much JS news.
[13:39:17] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:39:23] <duch_kazatel> wait eich did?!
[13:39:26] <duch_kazatel> woah
[13:39:26] <NoiseEee> and letterman is retiring so i'm all fucked up
[13:39:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[13:39:47] <duch_kazatel> wait letterman is retiring?! late night's going to suck.
[13:40:14] <decx> people actually still watch late night shows?
[13:40:29] <duch_kazatel> only when i'm drunk
[13:40:33] <duch_kazatel> so, yeah.
[13:40:34] <NoiseEee> i think so... i watched him all the time when i was younger / in HS
[13:42:12] <BillCriswell> I never got into those shows really.
[13:42:26] <decx> i only watched colbert/daily show, but stopped last year because american reality is too much like satire, it's depressing
[13:42:41] <duch_kazatel> i only ever liked letterman because he seemed to get the joke of late night tv the most.
[13:43:14] <decx> we had our own letterman ripoff in germany
[13:43:27] <NoiseEee> letterman is super smart and has a real sense of humour
[13:43:32] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[13:43:39] <decx> harald schmidt. he had a few good jokes sometime in the 90s and has been feeding of that for 20 years
[13:47:29] <duch_kazatel> http://pitchfork.com/news/54518-wu-tang-clan-announce-another-new-album-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin/
[13:47:33] <duch_kazatel> i mean, hell yes
[13:48:03] <Uhkis> wu-tang still exists?
[13:48:12] <duch_kazatel> oh hell yes they do.
[13:48:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha posted that the other day.
[13:48:38] <Uhkis> used to be a fan a loooong time ago :D
[13:48:43] <decx> "art"
[13:48:44] <BillCriswell> $1,000,000 album.
[13:48:54] <duch_kazatel> i heard about it, but the auction is up to like 5 mil isn't it?
[13:49:02] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't surprise me.
[13:49:09] <BillCriswell> I think it's cool how they're approaching it.
[13:49:13] <duch_kazatel> right?
[13:49:17] <BillCriswell> It's a completely unique approach.
[13:49:31] <duch_kazatel> genius.  and anybody taking the whole thing seriously needs to remember: it's the wu-tang clan.
[13:49:38] <BillCriswell> They're really treating it like it's one piece of art going for country to country.
[13:49:54] <Uhkis> gza is the genius :-D
[13:50:17] <decx> sounds like an excuse for mediocrity, the spent 2 years recording. turns out it's shit and they lost their mojo. how do we salvage this disaster
[13:50:23] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Agreed.
[13:50:23] <decx> maybe i'm just too bitter ;)
[13:51:00] <BillCriswell> decx: That's true cynicism right there haha
[13:51:15] <duch_kazatel> :D
[13:51:28] <BillCriswell> It sucks ODB wasn't around to be in on it.
[13:51:32] <BillCriswell> He was my favorite.
[13:52:20] <BillCriswell> I'm hoping when the box opens up it's just a giant picture of his face.
[13:52:27] <duch_kazatel> perfect.
[13:52:44] <Jattenalle> 128 minutes of background noise and static
[13:52:48] <Jattenalle> "Genious!"
[13:53:05] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Hahaha. It's like the rockos modern life episode
[13:53:40] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFXNuzuOc2M !
[13:53:51] <Jattenalle> my dad used to have an old LP, "Greatest hits" or somesuch.. all the artists on it were dead people, such as Louix "The King" XVI
[13:53:52] <Uhkis> btw, this would be the last channel i've ever guessed to have a conversation about wu-tang clan :-D
[13:53:54] <Jattenalle> Louis*
[13:54:05] <Jattenalle> was funny, it had tracks and everything, just silence
[13:54:35] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Haha.
[13:54:53] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: This channel always surprised me with its interests.
[13:56:09] <decx> i'd rather watch mayo again than the new adam sandler movie
[13:56:45] <decx> so eich resigned huh
[13:57:20] <BillCriswell> I'm always curious as to if his movies were always bad or they just recently started getting bad... like would 29 year old me watch Billy Madison for the first time and love it or hate it.
[13:57:51] <Jattenalle> hey, i quite like some of his movies
[13:57:55] <Jattenalle> a lot are horrid though
[13:58:10] <decx> i never liked any of these, but the rlm review for jack and jill was amazing
[13:58:13] <Jattenalle> i guess it's like Jim Carrey, some you hate, some you love
[13:58:22] <Jattenalle> can't stand pet detective today, used to love it
[13:58:38] <duch_kazatel> whaaat?!  the first one was awesome.
[13:58:50] <Jattenalle> i don't know, guess i outgrew them :(
[13:59:08] <Jattenalle> decx, time to watch that RLM i guess :)
[13:59:10] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: As do I, but I don't know if I'd like Billy Madison if it was freshly introduced to me. DO I just love it for nostalgia sake? I dunno.
[14:05:26] <decx> no one knows, that's the confusing part about nostalgia and changing tastes
[14:06:07] <decx> do i like it? do i like remembering who i was when i liked it? do i like it now because it's so terrible?
[14:11:21] <fission6> can someone recommend a light div slider
[14:11:41] <duch_kazatel> a what?
[14:12:10] <fission6> ah this works http://bxslider.com/examples/carousel-demystified
[14:12:27] <duch_kazatel> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:12:49] <becca_> i have an $.each statement that does not execute the function.  i am not clearly understanding callbacks.  do all the eachs need a callback?
[14:13:06] <DannyFritz> duch_kazatel: haha that website is ironic
[14:13:35] <Jattenalle> becca_, show code
[14:14:53] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, bookmarked for future reference
[14:14:59] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle :)
[14:15:48] <decx> i've never seen a text based carousel outside of this page
[14:16:10] <voronika> conference sites love them
[14:16:11] <Jattenalle> decx, all of blizzards sites use it, even their new battle.net app uses it
[14:16:12] <duch_kazatel> i see them less and less, but there are a lot of carousels that have text inside of them.
[14:16:13] <Jattenalle> it's horrible
[14:16:15] <voronika> as do marketing product sites
[14:16:22] <Jattenalle> Steam uses it for some things as well
[14:16:36] <becca_> http://plnkr.co/edit/cHtWC1TSwMZNIpoZ4GSw?p=catalogue
[14:16:39] <Jattenalle> though steam's been moving away from the text carousels in favor of... image carousels -_-
[14:17:04] <becca_> brace yourself.  this is a hack to get a job done.  i am working on improving.
[14:17:09] <duch_kazatel> I'm fine with the occasional one, but they have their place
[14:17:11] <decx> are carousel-tab hybrids still carousels?
[14:17:44] <duch_kazatel> as long as they don't move on their own, or at least stop moving when i interact with them, i can deal.
[14:18:28] <Jattenalle> becca_, $(selector].each(function(){ code });
[14:18:38] <Jattenalle> sorry, $(selector).each...
[14:20:49] <b1nd> My version of jQuery does not have a .done() so I can't do $.getScript('').done()
[14:21:11] <duch_kazatel> b1nd there's also .success() in older versions.
[14:21:16] <duch_kazatel> whgat version are you using?
[14:21:43] <b1nd> I am loading a function from my getScript and would like the function to load as soon as the script is loaded... Would doing $.getScript('name.js',function() { }); be safe?
[14:22:02] <printForever> hello people
[14:22:13] <printForever> can anyone tell me wtf am I doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/yr48f/17/
[14:22:17] <fission6> is jsfiddle still the go to?
[14:22:20] <fission6> i guess so
[14:22:21] <fission6> hahha
[14:22:23] <duch_kazatel> yes, jsfiddle is.
[14:22:27] <b1nd> duch_kazatel, not sure, since the version info is stripped from the jquery.js file
[14:22:35] <duch_kazatel> printForever what you you mean?
[14:22:46] <b1nd> o wait
[14:22:46] <printForever> I wanted to revert back
[14:22:49] <b1nd> 1.4.4
[14:22:50] <printForever> to old state
[14:22:54] <printForever> textarea state
[14:22:57] <printForever> I tried focusout
[14:22:59] <printForever> and blur
[14:23:02] <printForever> but... no luck
[14:23:04] <duch_kazatel> b1nd woah... upgrade.
[14:23:10] <b1nd> stop i can't
[14:23:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?  why not?
[14:23:34] <b1nd> not allowed
[14:23:42] <b1nd> .success not there as well
[14:23:42] <b1nd> so
[14:23:54] <b1nd> Would doing $.getScript('name.js',function() { }); be safe?
[14:23:54] <duch_kazatel> b1nd use .ajax().
[14:24:04] <systemfault> Probably the same reason as usually “I use some shitty wordpress theme with a plugin…. and changing it would break everything”
[14:24:19] <duch_kazatel> printForever probably because $('.note-editable').blur(function() { isn't binding.
[14:24:25] <becca_> Jattenalle:  i will give that a try.  weird question, but do you think it would work with $.each(selector) with one fewer nesting?  (i ask because it does)
[14:24:28] <duch_kazatel> printForever go read up on event delegation and .on()
[14:25:03] <becca_> and I am comparing the two to try to understand my error
[14:25:05] <Jattenalle> becca_, no idea, i'm not familiar at all with $.each() method, only ever used $(selector).each()
[14:25:13] <Jattenalle> becca_, but if it works, it works :)
[14:25:20] <printForever> duch_kazatel I got that part, but I dont know how to bind it. Because textarea gets hidden and its replaced with the div that has new class .note-editable... Can you give me a heads up, on what to search for?
[14:25:47] <duch_kazatel> $.each() is a convenience method, but be careful with it because it can be slow.
[14:26:11] <duch_kazatel> printForever 0- (~aslant@37.157.33.78) has joined #jquery
[14:26:11] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:03:14:25:03] <becca_> a
[14:26:12] <b1nd> What do you mean use ajax duch_kazatel  ?
[14:26:13] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[14:26:14] <becca_> does $().each require a callback also?
[14:26:24] <duch_kazatel> becca_ yyes
[14:26:27] <duch_kazatel> printForever https://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handlereventObject
[14:26:43] <duch_kazatel> printForever use $('parent').on('event', 'child', function(){});
[14:27:01] <duch_kazatel> where parent exists on pagelaod and child is the thing you want to watch for events from.
[14:27:02] <printForever> duch_kazatel, tnx man
[14:27:06] <becca_> on all each statements, all but the last, or what?
[14:27:22] <becca_> whithin the function of course
[14:27:24] <duch_kazatel> becca_ huh?
[14:27:48] <b1nd> Would doing $.getScript('name.js',function() { }); be safe?
[14:27:53] <printForever> duch_kazatel, its not a parent, its a sibiling... in DOM level
[14:28:05] <b1nd> Would doing $.getScript('load_foo_function.js',function() { foo();  }); be safe?
[14:28:11] <duch_kazatel> printForever you need to bind your listener to a parent.
[14:28:18] <duch_kazatel> b1nd you're spamming.
[14:28:20] <duch_kazatel> fyi
[14:29:02] <duch_kazatel> becca_ here's an example use of each() - http://jsfiddle.net/PCW4q/
[14:29:09] <duch_kazatel> b1nd define "safe"
[14:29:19] <becca_> :)  bear with me.  i am noob-ish.  i'll do some research and i might come back and rephrase the question
[14:29:37] <b1nd> "safe" as in foo() will get called each time, no errors calling foo() ever
[14:30:40] <duch_kazatel> b1nd according to https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/, that's how you'd define a success callback, yes.
[14:31:27] <b1nd> okay because it also says "The Callback is fired once the script has been loaded but not necessarily executed"
[14:31:38] <b1nd> but that is okay, since I will execute the script in the call back, right?
[14:31:42] <duch_kazatel> sounds about right.  why are you using getscript?
[14:31:57] <b1nd> I should just use <script> ?
[14:32:06] <printForever> duch_kazatel, I'm reading this and I dont know if you understood me. I want to trigger an event that destroys the first action in the function.
[14:32:09] <duch_kazatel> b1nd what are you loading.
[14:32:20] <b1nd> web app
[14:32:37] <duch_kazatel> printForever right - $('.note-editable').blur(function() { will never work because $('.note-editable') doesn't exist when you bind the listener.
[14:32:47] <printForever> oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ok
[14:32:54] <printForever> got it
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> printForever instead, you want to use a delegated listener - you need to attach it to a parent of .note-editable'.
[14:33:03] <duch_kazatel> b1nd what's the "web app"?
[14:33:24] <b1nd> big function
[14:33:29] <b1nd> that does bunch of other functions
[14:33:34] <duch_kazatel> that is not helpful at all.
[14:33:47] <b1nd> what do you want?
[14:33:54] <b1nd> like what it does?
[14:33:56] <duch_kazatel> what does this "big function" do?  why do you think you need getScript?
[14:34:21] <b1nd> I think I need getScript because I only want to call foo(); after the script has been loaded
[14:34:39] <b1nd> I need just use script tag?
[14:34:51] <duch_kazatel> ... yes.
[14:34:58] <duch_kazatel> and then call the function after the document is ready.
[14:35:16] <b1nd> ok
[14:35:35] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what you're loading so i don't know how it's written, but include it before your scripts and you should be fine.
[14:36:17] <b1nd> okay thanks
[14:36:25] <b1nd> why do people use getScript then?
[14:36:35] <duch_kazatel> because they want to conditionally load script files.
[14:36:54] <duch_kazatel> but that's not something i'd reccommend you'd do.
[14:37:20] <b1nd> ok
[14:45:04] <Voyage> hi
[14:45:28] <Voyage> how can I set jQuery date picker to send the date in some specific format (to the post form handler)?
[14:47:20] <printForever> duch_kazatel, this might be a stupid question. Should I always use $parent and .on() when having some dynamic changes in the DOM? Because sometimes jQuery wont fire, when new elements are created.
[14:47:40] <printForever> like, is that a definite fix for that problem?
[14:48:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:48:38] <duch_kazatel> use the delegated syntaxt for .on(), yes
[14:48:45] <printForever> ok, thank you
[14:48:50] <duch_kazatel> not "always", but when appropriate
[14:48:56] <printForever> ok ok
[14:49:40] <printForever> sometimes I use jQ to create DOM and then jQ that should work when an event of the created DOM is fired, nothing happens
[14:49:58] <printForever> so by using parent before .on I would solve the problem of the new content not working
[14:50:11] <printForever> because jQ will keep an eye on the elements inside parent
[14:50:12] <printForever> right_
[14:50:32] <printForever> * thats how I understood it, anyway
[14:50:45] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:50:48] <duch_kazatel> don't use parent before on.
[14:50:49] <printForever> aw crap
[14:50:54] <duch_kazatel> use on's delegated syntax.
[14:51:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/bQw76/
[14:52:17] <printForever> yeah, thats what I thought
[14:52:24] <printForever> maybe I didn't explained it correctly
[14:52:40] <cluelesscoder> I'm having an issue with hiding some elements by default or hiding them at runtime
[14:52:50] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder use css to do that.
[14:52:54] <cluelesscoder> I want to toggle them to show later (based on a click), but they won't show
[14:52:56] <printForever> instead of click, could I use any of the keyboard or mouse events
[14:53:04] <duch_kazatel> printForever yes.
[14:53:11] <printForever> OMG
[14:53:16] <printForever> THAT IS SO AWESOME! :)
[14:53:17] <duch_kazatel> printForever .on() is for binding events.
[14:53:21] <cluelesscoder> I did.... I have it in my css file, but when I set a click handler to toggle them and make them show, it doesn't work
[14:53:36] <duch_kazatel> stuff like .click() actually use .on() behind the scenes.
[14:53:41] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder have a fiddle?
[14:54:18] <printForever> duch_kazatel, sir you just opened a whole new world of jQ for me
[14:54:20] <cluelesscoder> its all wrapped up with server-side Flask template code... I could show you it on bitbucket....
[14:54:41] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder i care about what's rendered, not the templating ;)
[14:54:50] <duch_kazatel> printForever that's javascript.  it supports event delegation.
[14:55:04] <printForever> duch_kazatel - because he cares™
[14:55:06] <duch_kazatel> jquery adds some magic to it, but it's nothing new.
[14:55:11] <cluelesscoder> I'll do a fiddle...
[14:57:21] <cluelesscoder> dutch_kazatel: figured it out - I was targeting the <li> element rather than the <ul>
[14:58:34] <duch_kazatel> cluelesscoder cool.
[14:58:50] <mugger> I'm looking for something that lets me open a lookup type overlay.. basically it will be loading a smaller php page with data based on variables passed to it.. but I want it to open up in overlay when they click on link in table.. is jquery dialog suited for this? Or should I look elsewhere
[14:59:53] <duch_kazatel> a modal, you mean?
[15:00:58] <mugger> duch_kazatel: I'm not familiar with the term modal
[15:01:09] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean "overlay"
[15:01:20] <duch_kazatel> or "dialog"?
[15:01:44] <CrowX-> is $(selector).first().siblings equal to $(selector).not($(selector).first())?
[15:02:24] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- wat.
[15:02:40] <mugger> duch_kazatel: what I'd like to do is have a link to load say lookup.php?id=1&other_id=2 which would be a simple page with a form presenting some data in a overlay frame
[15:02:50] <duch_kazatel> like, an iframe?
[15:02:55] <duch_kazatel> because a modal would work for that.
[15:03:25] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- no. those are not the same.
[15:03:36] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what's the difference?
[15:03:40] <CrowX-> in the output
[15:03:53] <CrowX-> actually, I know the output of the first one. tell me what's different in the latter
[15:04:04] <CrowX-> oh, and I forgot to add () after sibligs in the first one
[15:04:23] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- one selects the first child's siblings, the other one gets the selector that isn't the first child of that selector.
[15:04:37] <duch_kazatel> what are you running it against?
[15:04:45] <CrowX-> curisoity
[15:04:57] <duch_kazatel> read through it and you'll see it.
[15:05:41] <mugger> duch_kazatel: seems like modal is what I'm after.. is this built into jquery or jquery ui? or should I look up something else
[15:06:15] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery all ready?
[15:06:17] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, if I modify the latter to $(selector).children().not($(selector).first())  will they then be the same?
[15:07:20] <mugger> duch_kazatel: yes, I'm using a few jquery ui things like accordion and tabs
[15:07:40] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- it depends on your html structor.
[15:07:45] <duch_kazatel> mugger then use dialog.
[15:08:59] <duch_kazatel> *structure
[15:09:42] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, is there a way to simplify this? "$(someSelector).first().siblings().not($(anotherSelector))
[15:09:56] <duch_kazatel> please provide the markup you're running it against.
[15:11:05] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, the site I showed you earlier. menu-row got huge height, so I'm thinking it might not set row's height properly
[15:11:13] <duch_kazatel> i don't hjave that link any more.
[15:11:18] <duch_kazatel> but a small fiddle would be wonderful.
[15:11:36] <CrowX-> and where menu-row is defined, that's how it's selected
[15:11:46] <CrowX-> (".menu-column").first().siblings().not($(self.column)),
[15:11:55] <CrowX-> wait
[15:11:56] <CrowX-> not that
[15:12:01] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- without seeing a small working example, it's hard to help.
[15:12:20] <CrowX-> this $(".menu-row").first().siblings().not($(self.row))
[15:12:31] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, I can't isolate it in jsfiddle
[15:12:42] <duch_kazatel> wait are you trying to get everything that isn't the current row
[15:12:42] <CrowX-> I'd have to remake too many things
[15:12:42] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:12:51] <CrowX-> yes
[15:13:01] <duch_kazatel> what's the deal with the .first() in there?
[15:13:24] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, I want to get everything that isn't the both the current and the first row
[15:14:09] <CrowX-> here's url http://whatishacking.org/rach
[15:14:27] <CrowX-> works perfectly well in chrome, firefox and opera
[15:14:38] <CrowX-> but ie9 somehow sets huge values to row's height
[15:14:48] <CrowX-> maybe it inherits its parents' height?
[15:14:58] <CrowX-> and since its parent's height isn't defined....
[15:15:00] <duch_kazatel> did you step through it or not?
[15:15:09] <CrowX-> did I step through what?
[15:15:28] <duch_kazatel> i suggested that you use IE's debugger.
[15:15:30] <duch_kazatel> did you do that?
[15:15:48] <CrowX-> ie's console reports no errors or w/e
[15:16:47] <duch_kazatel> did you use breakpoints and step through it line by line?
[15:17:38] <duch_kazatel> because you're probably calculating heights wrong.
[15:18:47] <duch_kazatel> there's an inline style on the first menu-row that is the height of the browser window.
[15:19:50] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, set by what?
[15:19:58] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  i'm not stepping through your code ;)
[15:21:39] <CrowX-> thanks
[15:22:01] <CrowX-> i'll try to hardcode the height in pixels
[15:22:05] <CrowX-> and see if it changes anything
[15:22:50] <duch_kazatel> btw: http://jsfiddle.net/xQ2LL/2/
[15:22:56] <duch_kazatel> there's the menu markup and css abstracted out.
[15:24:41] <CrowX-> row's height is set by js
[15:24:52] <duch_kazatel> i know.
[15:32:43] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- http://jsfiddle.net/xQ2LL/4/
[15:32:55] <duch_kazatel> here's one way to approach your whole height thing.
[15:34:49] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, what does $(this).data('height', $(this).height());   do?
[15:35:08] <CrowX-> oh nvm
[15:35:09] <CrowX-> i saw
[15:35:12] <duch_kazatel> sets data on a thing to its height ;)
[15:36:59] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, check the site now btw from ie and tell me if anything is different
[15:37:11] <duch_kazatel> why don't you check it?
[15:37:19] <CrowX-> cause I'd have to reboot
[15:37:22] <CrowX-> i'm working on linux
[15:37:25] <duch_kazatel> vmware man
[15:37:34] <duch_kazatel> and still broken.
[15:37:39] <CrowX-> in the same way?
[15:37:45] <duch_kazatel> well, differently at least.
[15:37:54] <CrowX-> what's row's height now?
[15:38:21] <duch_kazatel> 17px
[15:38:29] <CrowX-> so the menu is ok, right?
[15:38:38] <duch_kazatel> not the way you want it to be, no.
[15:38:49] <CrowX-> damn
[15:38:52] <CrowX-> i'll reboot
[15:38:56] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[15:39:02] <CrowX-> what
[15:39:08] <duch_kazatel> just download the virtual machine microsoft gives away for free.
[15:39:51] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, then i'll have to install windows on it
[15:40:15] <CrowX-> which is a 45 minutes work
[15:40:27] <CrowX-> i plan to have fixed this by then :p
[15:40:29] <duch_kazatel> www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools
[15:45:13] <__joshua__> damn you jquery.  why doesnt throwing in 'then' flow onto the next fail handler?
[15:45:20] <__joshua__> should probably use Q
[15:55:26] <__joshua__> whats the cheapest test to see if an element is attached to the dom?
[15:55:36] <duch_kazatel> .length i'd assume.
[15:55:41] <duch_kazatel> .length > 0
[15:55:42] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: assume.com - ☹ TAKEN
[15:57:58] <duch_kazatel> today is starting to drag
[15:58:52] <__joshua__> $(el).parents('body') i think
[15:59:00] <__joshua__> el is a dom reference
[15:59:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:59:54] <duch_kazatel> length will all ready be on the selector, no need to run a new one.
[16:00:23] <__joshua__> ah, document.contains
[16:00:26] <__joshua__> thats what i want
[16:00:36] <__joshua__> documents.contains(my_el)
[16:20:01] <macscam1> i am not sure why making one div in my app hidden made nothing show up
[16:20:10] <macscam1> i expected nothing to change except the one be hidden ...
[16:20:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:20:30] <macscam1> i am thinking maybe jquery is no longer able to access the element
[16:20:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:20:49] <duch_kazatel> hiding it doesn't do that.
[16:21:10] <macscam1> i know, i just read that ..... but i dont know what the problem is
[16:21:21] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it please :)
[16:21:35] <macscam1> dutch_kazatel ok
[16:21:45] <printForever> duch_kazatel, its not working!!! :((((((((

[16:21:57] <duch_kazatel> printForever fiddle it?
[16:22:01] <printForever> yeah... sec
[16:22:09] <macscam1> dutch_kazatel difficult to fiddle it because it's in a rails app
[16:22:31] <duch_kazatel> you can give an isolated use case.
[16:23:38] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/yr48f/18/

[16:24:24] <printForever> second div
[16:25:57] <duch_kazatel> uuuhhh...
[16:26:08] <duch_kazatel> what events did you try?
[16:26:58] <printForever> the second one
[16:26:59] <macscam1> dutch_kazatel ok i figured it out .... it was a weird problem with rails i think
[16:27:09] <printForever> duch_kazatel .on()
[16:27:11] <duch_kazatel> "the second one" ?
[16:27:19] <duch_kazatel> printForever i mean blur, click...
[16:27:20] <printForever> oh events
[16:27:25] <printForever> blur and focusout
[16:28:19] <printForever> problem is, I believe, is that once you click the text in the textarea
[16:28:27] <printForever> it replaces the textarea with bunch of DIV's
[16:28:40] <duch_kazatel> correct - it's a contendeditable div.
[16:28:46] <printForever> yes
[16:28:59] <printForever> rendering the textarea focusout useless
[16:29:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:29:16] <printForever> well, textarea is hidden
[16:29:26] <printForever> its replaced with editable div
[16:29:33] <duch_kazatel> right, which is why you're using the blur of the contenteditable div.
[16:29:41] <printForever> I wanted to revert back, from editable div, to textarea by focusing out the editable div
[16:29:42] <duch_kazatel> i can see what all is going in in firebug ;)
[16:29:43] <printForever> but it failed
[16:29:50] <printForever> I use Firebug too
[16:29:56] <printForever> but cant see jack sh/t

[16:38:48] <duch_kazatel> *we're
[16:38:53] <printForever> eBay, I knew it... drunk off your arses :D
[16:38:58] <duch_kazatel> hah, nah.
[16:38:59] <systemfault> amazon? :P
[16:39:02] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:39:20] <systemfault> Then you’re minor in ecommerce :P
[16:39:38] <systemfault> $(duch_kazatel).troll()
[16:39:40] <duch_kazatel> our revenue numbers would say differently :)
[16:39:54] <duch_kazatel> i'll probably reveal who i am/where i work at some point.  i'm weird about it.
[16:40:06] <systemfault> In the pr0n industry?
[16:40:10] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[16:40:37] <printForever> let the man go!
[16:40:48] <systemfault> Ok, you can leave :’(
[16:40:54] <systemfault> But we’ll miss you
[16:40:58] <duch_kazatel> D:
[16:41:02] <duch_kazatel> where am i going
[16:41:02] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:41:12] <printForever> he is trippin, dont mind him
[16:41:27] <systemfault> printForever: IRC can be trippy at times.
[16:44:27] <printForever> duch_kazatel, one question. what happens if I have multiple active_textareas open...
[16:44:34] <printForever> will this close them all at once
[16:44:38] <duch_kazatel> yup
[16:44:45] <printForever> thats why I was using $this
[16:45:02] <printForever> is there a way I can prevent closing all of them at once?
[16:45:06] <duch_kazatel> okay.  shoot over the fiddle again?
[16:45:09] <printForever> ok
[16:45:12] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/yr48f/21/
[16:45:52] <duch_kazatel> wait...
[16:46:01] <duch_kazatel> how would you have more than one open at a time?
[16:46:11] <printForever> on the same page, but in a different tab
[16:46:18] <duch_kazatel> you're removing it on the blur event.
[16:46:24] <duch_kazatel> clicking a tab will fire that event
[16:47:00] <duch_kazatel> soooo...
[16:48:36] <printForever> ITS PERFECT
[16:49:15] <printForever> if you were a gay guy I would let systemfault kiss you
[16:49:26] <printForever> awww... what the hell, I would let him kiss you anyway
[16:49:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:49:59] <systemfault> My wife wouldn’t like me to kiss gays, no matter how awesome at JS/jQuery they are
[16:50:07] <systemfault> Oh shit...
[16:50:12] <systemfault> I really meant to write guys
[16:50:23] <printForever> duuuuude, he is like a master JS/jQuery... a guru
[16:50:33] <printForever> you should be having his babies right now
[16:50:37] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[16:50:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm not.
[16:50:45] <duch_kazatel> i just know a thing or two.
[16:51:37] <systemfault> The master of the callback, the DOMinator of the DOM, the async messiah, duch_kazatel!!!!
[16:51:59] <systemfault> **clap**
[16:52:18] <printForever> **applause**
[16:53:53] <duch_kazatel> "async messiah"
[16:53:55] <duch_kazatel> i like that.
[16:54:12] <printForever> haha, you should change the nickname
[16:54:33] <printForever> hahaha
[16:54:33] <async_messiah> eeeeh, feels weird.
[16:54:48] <printForever> duch_kazatel not naming the company I wanted to know
[16:55:00] <duch_kazatel> sure yeah that's it.
[16:55:05] <duch_kazatel> ... >.> jerlk
[16:55:12] <printForever> how hard were the HR people on you before you signed on
[16:55:26] <duch_kazatel> not at all, actually.
[16:55:27] <systemfault> HR people are clueless...
[16:55:33] <duch_kazatel> ours are pretty great.
[16:55:33] <printForever> how did the interview go? where there any special questions? tests?
[16:55:37] <duch_kazatel> at my place?
[16:55:50] <printForever> yeah, at your place
[16:56:11] <printForever> I was thinking on applying, but I always have some sort of a fear of HR people
[16:56:30] <duch_kazatel> i gave 'em a sampling of work, they had me do a small project in the frotnend language that's being used (coldfusion - yuck).
[16:56:38] <duch_kazatel> coupla interviews.  nothing crazy
[16:56:54] <systemfault> printForever: Just be nice… they’re usually clueless about everything technical, the point is to see if you would be a good match for the company’s culture.
[16:57:07] <printForever> once I was in CocaCola for the store level sales position and they had some weird test with some boxes and people and working positions... it was just weird
[16:57:16] <systemfault> printForever: Then.. if you succeed, you usually have an interview with someone more technical after.
[16:57:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the HR interviews are to weed out the obvious non-candidates.
[16:57:46] <duch_kazatel> our technical recruiter is fantastic at that part of the job.
[16:57:58] <printForever> systemfault, this CocaCola expirience was really weird
[16:58:15] <systemfault> Haha :)
[16:58:34] <systemfault> I worked as a frontend for playboy for a year… that was weird
[16:59:13] <duch_kazatel> i know a guy who worked for one of the companies they bought out.
[16:59:17] <printForever> it was something, if I remember right. you had 5 working posts, and you needed to manage 10 workers, but one work post needed 4 workers, and there was an age issue with some of them... and the process was moving and shifting, so some of them were idle
[16:59:55] <printForever> systemfault, I think playboy is clueless about their web direction. they could be doing so much more with that brand
[17:00:10] <duch_kazatel> printForever you know they own a TON of sites, yeah?
[17:00:26] <printForever> sure, but I was talking about the PLAYBOY brand
[17:00:31] <duch_kazatel> ah, fair enough
[17:00:37] <printForever> they bought Jenna's website, I remember that one
[17:00:57] <printForever> not that I was a visitor or something :D
[17:01:00] <systemfault> printForever: Yeah… their digital department was bought 2 years ago by a company in Montreal (Manwin… who was renamed to Mindgeek recently)
[17:02:05] <systemfault> Basically, that company owns most of the pr0n of the interwebz
[17:02:42] <systemfault> Hmm, weird discussion for #jQuery
[17:03:02] <duch_kazatel> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkVS7lOCIAAQfEd.png:large
[17:03:06] <duch_kazatel> well that's an interesting result.
[17:03:31] <tandroid> None of the rooms I'm in are talking about anything related to the room title right now haha
[17:03:41] <tandroid> Must just be the time of day…
[17:03:46] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[17:04:03] <systemfault> 8pm here
[17:04:03] <printForever> systemfault, can you tell me, what is a persons job on that kind of a website. looking from a professional standpoint
[17:04:12] <printForever> 2:04 AM in Serbia
[17:04:23] <tandroid> Exactly!
[17:04:33] <tandroid> But seriously that was a joke.
[17:04:45] <duch_kazatel> 5:04 pm here
[17:05:03] <printForever> I mean, the biggest thing on the website, is the video... Design is on hte second or third place.
[17:05:08] <printForever> systemfault
[17:05:55] <systemfault> printForever: Any website needs frontend and backend programmers… I’ve been in both positions. Then there’s the designers… monkeys who resize pictures… More people who choose the content.. Other organize sweepstakes.. Then there’s the whole SEO part.
[17:06:01] <printForever> also, we solved all of the jQuery problems, so we can talk about anything now :)
[17:06:37] <printForever> systemfault, ouh, I didn't know that it was a that big of an operation
[17:06:43] <systemfault> printForever: It’s the same as any other content-oriented website.
[17:06:57] <duch_kazatel> printForever yeah, that's pretty normal.
[17:07:15] <systemfault> printForever: And I forgot a lot of things…
[17:07:39] <printForever> systemfault, duch_kazatel how old are you guys?
[17:07:46] <printForever> 3.0 right here
[17:07:51] <systemfault> printForever: i’m 31, from Montreal (Canada)
[17:07:54] <duch_kazatel> i'm 27 on the 9th
[17:08:14] <printForever> about in the same age group of Super Nintendo :D
[17:08:19] <systemfault> Yes
[17:08:19] <duch_kazatel> yup
[17:08:25] <printForever> kids now days...
[17:08:26] <printForever>  geez
[17:08:29] <printForever> :))))))))))
[17:08:33] <systemfault> Chrono Trigger + Final Fantasy 6 + MegaMan X for ever
[17:09:16] <printForever> I was a Sega Mega Drive II kind of a guy. Loved the Comix Zone. The best SEGA game ever made.
[17:09:54] <systemfault> Ah sega… I bought one for Sonic 2 :/
[17:10:14] <printForever> systemfault, never played Final Fantasy franchise... have I missed out?
[17:10:18] <systemfault> Then found out that others games were better for the SNES (Except the exclusives for the Genesis)
[17:10:32] <systemfault> printForever: If you don’t like the genre, you missed nothing.
[17:10:39] <printForever> recently I bought Nintendo 64, just so I could get Mario Kart 64. Once that done, awww man... :D
[17:10:47] <systemfault> If you like RPGs, these were the best.
[17:11:03] <duch_kazatel> Super Mario World.  i remember getting like 95% on that.
[17:11:24] <systemfault> I think 96 was the max.
[17:11:37] <printForever> sometimes, I look back and see how much time we (I) spent with friends playing those games.
[17:11:52] <systemfault> There was a single exit I had never found by myself… learned its existence because of the web
[17:12:01] <duch_kazatel> oh shit.  it was.
[17:12:04] <duch_kazatel> that explains a lot.
[17:12:56] <printForever> its nice to be a contemporary of this age of an advanced development of the IT industry
[17:13:21] <systemfault> Yeah.. we had the chance to see everything happening...
[17:13:27] <printForever> but I felt, and I'm sorry if someone might feel offended by this, once Steve Jobs died, the magic spark of having fun in the IT went through the window...
[17:14:06] <systemfault> I liked how he pushed the industry
[17:14:08] <printForever> its strange, but I felt the games and everything else in computing was driven more by enthusiasts than by money grabbing economies and managers
[17:14:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:14:24] <duch_kazatel> i don't agree with the first thing at all.
[17:14:36] <printForever> Jobs, thing? well...
[17:14:40] <duch_kazatel> if anything, job's draconian policies did some of that before his death.
[17:14:47] <duch_kazatel> *jobs'
[17:14:57] <printForever> policies?
[17:14:59] <printForever> like?
[17:15:10] <duch_kazatel> the closed garden approach of the iphone imo.
[17:15:19] <duch_kazatel> *walled garden.
[17:15:39] <printForever> duch_kazatel, I have to say I LOVE IT. I dont own one, but I love the system. Far far more control over the apps than on Google Play.
[17:15:43] <duch_kazatel> which is fine, but there were some pretty extreme cases of controlling what could not go on with those devices.
[17:15:51] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[17:16:20] <duch_kazatel> the ecosystem is fine.  and his vehement refusal to allow flash on their devices was frustrating.
[17:16:36] <systemfault> Hmm, I think that was the best move Jobs ever did
[17:16:38] <printForever> Once, a friend, an android developer, during Android baby steps, told me he could aquire almost all of the passwords from the phone, by someone installing his app, and then updating the app with a small update that would never trace back any security flaws back to him.
[17:16:39] <systemfault> Oh well..
[17:16:59] <printForever> Apple took system security a lot, a lot tighter.
[17:17:17] <duch_kazatel> systemfault sure, but i disagree with his stance on it.  his claim that it was "closed" vs. apple's "open".
[17:17:27] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[17:17:45] <duch_kazatel> and printForever OS X stores certain passwords in plaintext iirc.
[17:17:55] <printForever> leaving flash behind was a good move, but then again... devices, like iPad 1st gen, could run flash... in a global way it made us move forward to HTML5
[17:17:57] <duch_kazatel> or at least it used to.  WiFi
[17:18:30] <printForever> I always used password vault for everything
[17:18:40] <duch_kazatel> wifi stored passwords.
[17:18:46] <printForever> yeah, I remember that
[17:19:08] <printForever> I was following Apple since early 2000
[17:19:18] <duch_kazatel> arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/debug-code-in-os-x-1073-exposes-passwords-for-legacy-filevault-network-users/
[17:19:47] <systemfault> Every OSes had their vulnerabilities…
[17:19:50] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:19:55] <duch_kazatel> apple is no better or worse imo.
[17:20:14] <printForever> I'm not going to downplay this in any way, but... I'm still on 10.6
[17:20:15] <printForever> :D
[17:20:26] <systemfault> I only praise Apple for their “execution”
[17:20:47] <printForever> they did a crazy job moving from 32bit OS to 64bit OS in a YEAR
[17:20:51] <systemfault> And for pushing hi-res screens…
[17:20:52] <printForever> in a freaking YEAR
[17:21:11] <systemfault> printForever: Easy when you have 100% control of the devices/ecosystem.
[17:21:12] <printForever> yeah, thats right systemfault
[17:21:17] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:21:36] <duch_kazatel> their hardware design is pretty solid - Ive i like.
[17:21:44] <printForever> Microsoft had Intel create 64bit CPU's and was still going strong with 32bit
[17:21:57] <systemfault> printForever: That’s not true.
[17:22:14] <printForever> AMD was the first one to break through and Intel followed
[17:22:15] <systemfault> printForever: The 64bit x86 CPU was created by AMD
[17:22:20] <printForever> :)))))
[17:22:25] <systemfault> Intel cried.
[17:22:26] <printForever> I knew what you were going to write
[17:22:31] <printForever> Intel FTW! :D
[17:22:47] <systemfault> Now yes… back in the days of the P4, Intel sucked.
[17:22:55] <printForever> oh boy
[17:22:56] <duch_kazatel> erm, the first major consumer one, at least.
[17:22:57] <printForever> did they
[17:23:31] <printForever> Intel made a quantum leap (anyone else remember that show) when they came out with Core i3, i5, i7 series
[17:23:54] <printForever> AMD was just eating their dust
[17:24:16] <systemfault> They started rebecoming good when they finally got rid of their shitty netburst architecture(P4). They took a P3, added all the new coolness they had developped over the years.. The Pentium M was born.
[17:24:44] <printForever> anyway, great times for tech guys like us to be living the period
[17:24:52] <duch_kazatel> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_processor_timeline
[17:24:54] <duch_kazatel> interesting stuff.
[17:25:01] <systemfault> Then the Pentium M was so successful (was faster than the P4 at half the frequency and power) that they based their core architecture on it.
[17:25:18] <systemfault> Then the i3/i5/i7
[17:25:30] <printForever> systemfault do you remember how netburst came to existance? They were competing with Apple! :D
[17:25:59] <systemfault> IIRC, they wanted a super flexible architecture they could use for years.
[17:26:18] <systemfault> And… they did it, it lasted years… but was way too complex.
[17:26:47] <printForever> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9VWRB07yqc
[17:28:55] <duch_kazatel> oh god i remember that video
[17:34:07] <CrowX-> How can I know if an image is fully loaded?
[17:34:21] <duch_kazatel> the load event
[17:34:38] <CrowX-> but what if that image's src has been in the cache?
[17:34:50] <CrowX-> will the load event still fire?
[17:35:17] <CrowX-> let's say another image has been loaded with that src
[17:35:19] <systemfault> CrowX-: Yes, just set the src of the image after adding a load event.
[17:36:01] <systemfault> myImage.on(‘load’, function() { console.log(‘loaded’); }); myImage.prop(‘src’, myUrl);
[17:37:24] <kongthap> hi, how can i select element with data-x="0" and data-y="0" ?
[17:38:01] <systemfault> $(‘[data-x=“0”][data-y=“0”]’)
[17:38:16] <duch_kazatel> give it a class or ID and select that instead.
[17:38:23] <duch_kazatel> because hoo boy those are slow.
[17:38:24] <systemfault> Don’t do that in a loop though… it has to be the slower selector ever
[17:38:33] <systemfault> *slowest
[17:41:16] <printForever> [02:28] <duch_kazatel> oh god i remember that video || watched it million times :) Jon Rubinstein was awesome
[17:47:38] <printForever> systemfault, duch_kazatel, how hard is it to get a job US/CAN in our line of work
[17:48:04] <printForever> I've been talking to few people who are not really in our line of work and they are saying that its pretty hard
[17:48:04] <duch_kazatel> depends: do you know what you're doing?
[17:48:16] <duch_kazatel> there's a shortage of decent developers right now.
[17:48:20] <duch_kazatel> at least in the US.
[17:48:49] <printForever> duch_kazatel I'm great with HTML/CSS... not like great, but... really good
[17:49:07] <printForever> and I know my way around photography, Photoshop, design...
[17:49:46] <printForever> I'm lacking skills in jQ, PHP, MySQL but I understand what I'm doing, its not that I'm clueless, well, not all the time
[17:49:46] <duch_kazatel> what is "our line of work?
[17:50:06] <duch_kazatel> because i’m a frontend developer - i occasionally touch our middleware, never our backend, and occasionally our DBs.
[17:50:17] <printForever> ExpressionEngine, Textpattern, WordPress (hate WP)... frontend developer
[17:50:44] <duch_kazatel> you should be proficient enough that the language/framework doesn’t matter terribly much.
[17:50:59] <printForever> most of my websites are done by hand with very little framework or off the shelf solutions
[17:51:10] <duch_kazatel> i have to use coldfusion at my current place.  we all hate it, but it’s apart of reality for us.
[17:51:35] <systemfault> printForever: If you’re good, only the first one will be a bit difficult to get..
[17:51:50] <printForever> the first one?
[17:51:51] <systemfault> printForever: You’ll get most of your jobs via reference after.
[17:51:57] <printForever> aaaahhhh ok
[17:52:05] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  work on that portfolio.
[17:52:08] <systemfault> It’s just a matter of seizing the opportunity
[17:52:21] <systemfault> I found my current job on Freenode...
[17:52:27] <systemfault> (Like my wife… lol)
[17:52:41] <printForever> I worked for a year in an international IT level company, very very big company and I have awesome recommendations. I've been working on .NET :/
[17:52:41] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:52:47] <tandroid> systemfault: you found your wife on freenode?
[17:52:50] <tandroid> That's incredible haha
[17:52:51] <duch_kazatel> i like .net personally.
[17:52:54] <systemfault> tandroid: Yes :P
[17:52:58] <printForever> systemfault hahahaha
[17:53:02] <duch_kazatel> as long as you’re using ALL MS.
[17:53:19] <printForever> I don't like MS
[17:53:23] <systemfault> printForever: You might want to find a non-ms job...
[17:53:35] <systemfault> Or else you’ll be stuck in the MS world for good.
[17:53:41] <printForever> their tools might be the best one in our current day and age
[17:53:43] <duch_kazatel> systemfault not necessarily.
[17:53:46] <duch_kazatel> it depends.
[17:53:50] <printForever> but my God... .NET is awful
[17:53:51] <duch_kazatel> i got my start in a .net shop.
[17:53:58] <systemfault> printForever: C# is awesome.
[17:54:28] <duch_kazatel> .net is fantastic.  super tight integration.  one of the best IDEs i’ve ever seen.  IIS is a decent server these days.
[17:54:34] <duch_kazatel> MSSQL is neat/
[17:55:00] <printForever> systemfault, duch_kazatel, I dont know...
[17:55:13] <printForever> I found bugs in .NET that are dating back from v1
[17:55:16] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[17:55:29] <printForever> and until 2 years ago they still were not fixed
[17:55:40] <duch_kazatel> because, btw, almost every platform has major, longstanding bugs.
[17:55:45] <systemfault> printForever: In north america.. if you’re not doing .net and you’re backend dev… then you’re likely doing PHP or Java.
[17:55:54] <printForever> duch_kazatel, honestly, I forgot... :/
[17:55:56] <duch_kazatel> or maybe node or ruby.
[17:56:15] <duch_kazatel> .NET is fantastic.  trust me.  as long as you’re not doing anything funky.
[17:56:20] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Node perhaps… I don’t know any company doing Ruby :P
[17:56:23] <printForever> php, java, node, ruby - all great platforms
[17:56:36] <systemfault> (I’m working with node ATM)
[17:56:38] <duch_kazatel> systemfault there are a few still kicking around.
[17:56:46] <duch_kazatel> our mobile platform is getting built on node
[17:57:04] <printForever> node is great and I am waiting for it to boom
[17:57:05] <duch_kazatel> those guys are lucky.
[17:57:13] <duch_kazatel> it is booming.
[17:57:23] <printForever> maybe in US, not in rest of the world
[17:57:33] <duch_kazatel> lots of major companies are using it.
[17:57:37] <duch_kazatel> where are you?
[17:57:38] <printForever> I havent noticed it in EU
[17:57:42] <printForever> Serbia
[17:57:50] <duch_kazatel> oh ow.
[17:57:51] <duch_kazatel> *wow
[17:58:26] <printForever> all of the research I did about node, when I came about, it was used sparse and that there wasnt all that much of node out there in the mainstream
[17:58:35] <duch_kazatel> there is now.
[17:58:45] <printForever> duch_kazatel, might be

[18:06:42] <kongthap> hi all, this is my selector $("input.txt_bet[data-animal='0']) how can i replace 0 with variable my_animal ?
[18:08:53] <systemfault> kongthap: create the string using +
[18:09:45] <kongthap> systemfault, ok i got it, thanks :)
[18:13:14] <kongthap> if i want to get json "once" from php backend on pageload without sending any parameters, i must use $.ajax({type:'GET'}) inside $(document).ready(function() {}); right?
[18:13:38] <systemfault> Yes.
[18:14:49] <zumba_ad_> folks, i put the value of a $('.someclass').text() to a variable. Now I would like to update some parts of the text using replace. How do I push it back to .text?
[18:16:06] <zumba_ad_> I got it
[18:19:13] <zumba_ad_> how come, I replaced the text with <a href="http://localhost">click here</a> but when it got rendered, it was rendered as a regular string and not a link?
[18:19:58] <systemfault> zumba_ad_: text isn’t html
[18:20:05] <zumba_ad_> ah
[18:20:09] <systemfault> zumba_ad_: That’s why jquery has .text and .html
[18:20:14] <zumba_ad_> got it :)
[18:20:20] <wa5ted> Cork: this guy is so hard to corner
[18:20:23] <zumba_ad_> i'm pulling it from <span>
[18:20:35] <zumba_ad_> I'll try .html. Thank you
[18:21:25] <zumba_ad_> now, replace function is undefined
[18:21:42] <zumba_ad_> I used .html().replace
[18:21:56] <CrowX-> I have a click event that changes an image's src. How can I prevent the click event while the image is loading? I tried setting a 'false' flag after the line that changes the image's src in the click event, and changing the flag to positive in the onload event of the image, and made the click event do nothing if the flag is set to negative.
[18:22:05] <CrowX-> However, that doesn't work always and I have no idea why
[18:22:16] <CrowX-> Is there a better solution for this?
[18:22:22] <systemfault> zumba_ad_: you can’t just do a replace like that.
[18:22:28] <zumba_ad_> oh
[18:22:47] <systemfault> zumba_ad_: You need to do something like myNode.html(myNode.html().replace(…….));
[18:23:01] <zumba_ad_> that's what I did
[18:23:09] <zumba_ad_> posting code, one sec
[18:24:00] <zumba_ad_>     $('.message-text').html($('.message-text').html().replace('replacethislink','<a href="'+appLinks.get('applink')+'">here</a>'))
[18:24:27] <zumba_ad_> it worked when i used .text but it was being rendered as text like you said earlier
[18:25:32] <systemfault> zumba_ad_: Works here.. http://jsfiddle.net/8xpUC/
[18:25:37] <zumba_ad_> ok
[18:25:48] <systemfault> Used your same code… except I changed then applink thingy to ‘LOL'
[18:26:25] <zumba_ad_> yeah, that worked, that's weird
[18:27:08] <zumba_ad_> it doesn't matter if it was from <span> right?
[18:27:27] <systemfault> It doesn’t matter, right
[18:31:14] <zumba_ad_> got it
[18:33:39] <zumba_ad_> oh, the error is Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[18:34:35] <zumba_ad_> it worked now :)
[18:45:30] <bowenac> anyone know how I could create another variable from this var start = $.fullCalendar.formatDate(event.start, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"); but add 30 minutes?
[18:49:17] <bowenac> nm I ust added 30 to the mm lol
[18:49:57] <jphase> bowenac: you need to make a date object (can't remember if full cal returns that from that method or not) and then add minutes to it... you can make a function like...   function add_minutes(date, minutes) { return new Date(date.getTime() + minutes * 60000); }
[18:50:10] <jphase> or just add 30 to the mm heh
[18:50:25] <jphase> that won't account for the odd occurrences though
[18:50:28] <bowenac> I thought I was in jquery channel haha
[18:50:38] <bowenac> I'm only using it for eventdrop
[18:50:40] <jphase> well that's not really a jquery question
[18:50:48] <bowenac> im checking if an event was dropped from an allday event
[18:50:56] <bowenac> if no end time add 30 mm
[18:51:16] <bowenac> js but i am using jquery lol
[18:52:12] <bowenac> jphase now if I could get my events to render correctly every time
[18:52:16] <bowenac> jphase http://www.adamcbowen.com/demos/testing/test-page/
[18:53:09] <bowenac> meh ill just use rerenderevents for now
[18:53:14] <bowenac> seems to do the trick
[18:53:32] <jphase> haven't worked with full calendar in awhile, did a gnarly one with google cal feeds for groups on this site a few years back:  http://cascadeaids.org/calendar
[18:54:18] <jphase> god that looks so bad to me now, I remember thinking it was so cool lol
[18:54:27] <bowenac> lol nice
[18:54:36] <beancurd> jphase: why not use moment.js?
[18:54:41] <bowenac> is hooking into ical difficult?
[18:54:51] <bowenac> mine is per user
[18:54:55] <beancurd> makes time stuff less painful
[18:54:56] <bowenac> not public
[18:55:17] <jphase> yeah, full cal has cal dav support natively and the client was already using google cal
[18:55:56] <bowenac> I know its included I have the file, just not sure if you need to use oauth or what since I am doing it on a per user scenario lol
[18:56:13] <bowenac> so each user would have to give auth Im assuming
[18:56:23] <bowenac> unless you just use there email which is highly doubtful lol
[18:57:05] <jphase> you'd have to make some db driven place where the user could enter their feed url
[18:57:18] <jphase> if you're planning on doing it on wordpress you might as well just use the wp db anyhow imo :\
[18:58:00] <b1nd> If I have a script that contains many jquery plugs, is it safe to call that script after document ready?
[18:58:00] <bowenac> already am
[18:58:01] <bowenac> its a plugin
[18:58:06] <bowenac> uses shortcode to display it
[18:58:17] <jphase> figured
[18:58:33] <bowenac> but no back end for the user
[18:58:49] <bowenac> I guess I could add a button at the top to add ical feed link etc
[18:59:00] <bowenac> and put that into user_events_users table
[18:59:05] <bowenac> I guess something like that would work
[18:59:26] <jphase> b1nd: contains meaning you're calling functions from those plugins?
[18:59:47] <b1nd> yes
[18:59:58] <b1nd> I am calling functions for the plugins inside of the document ready as well
[19:00:10] <b1nd> or should all jquery plugins be ran outside of document ready?
[19:00:14] <jphase> b1nd: you can put it in doc ready but you mostly just need to make sure it loads after the other scripts do
[19:00:27] <b1nd> and then only inside of document ready we should call them?
[19:00:38] <jphase> it's not required to put in doc ready but it definitely doesn't hurt
[19:01:03] <b1nd> well I tried to put them inside of document ready, and it is almost like they all load at different times
[19:01:47] <jphase> make sure you put your scripts before your </body> tag like you're supposed to and then it basically doesn't matter as long as you put your plugins before the script that calls them. Make your custom.js or whatever script that calls the plugins be the last thing before </body>
[19:02:41] <b1nd> well thing is, sometimes it says [OBJECT Object].validate not found
[19:02:59] <b1nd> and if I refresh the page then sometimes it runs as expected and validate is found
[19:03:05] <jphase> b1nd: hastebin.com your page source or link to it
[19:03:45] <b1nd> well I am just kind of talking here, don't have a live example built that I can demonstrate
[19:04:29] <jphase> b1nd: you don't *have* to put things in doc ready, but I personally always do just for shits/giggles
[19:04:41] <jphase> it doesn't hurt to load things after the DOM has loaded ever
[19:04:49] <b1nd> yes that is what I though
[19:04:56] <kongthap> inside $("input").change(function(e) {}); i have a some amount testing, if it false, how can i undo to the previous input value ?
[19:04:57] <jphase> well, at least not in most conventional situations :)
[19:05:04] <b1nd> but, I have big file with many jQuery plugins inside
[19:05:25] <b1nd> and then my function that uses all of the plugins
[19:05:26] <jphase> kongthap: on falst use $(this).val($(this).prev().val());
[19:05:28] <b1nd> at the end of the file
[19:05:34] <jphase> s/falst/false
[19:05:45] <kongthap> jphase, thanks :)
[19:05:52] <b1nd> and I do $.getScript('my.js',function() { foo(); } );
[19:06:50] <b1nd> and sometimes it finds all of the jQuery plugins and lets the function run normal and sometimes it does not find all the plugins and and on line `$("#table").validate();` in console log it says [Object Object].validate undefined
[19:06:57] <jphase> b1nd: well getScript is an async event so it's going to require network load time before your function executes
[19:07:17] <jphase> stuff will fire after it (before network loads the script) if one is quicker than the other
[19:07:43] <b1nd> even if all of the plugins are in one big .js file?
[19:08:12] <kongthap> jphase, why it returns empty instead of previous value
[19:08:13] <b1nd> listed at the top of the file and then after my foo() ?
[19:08:18] <jphase> b1nd: at this point I can't advise you any further unless I see the code to be honest, it really depends on why you're using getScript and how your events are written
[19:08:41] <jphase> kongthap: if the previous element is a label or anything but an input, that won't work, I can't tell you without seeing your html
[19:09:11] <kongthap> jphase, it's an input with type="number"
[19:09:16] <b1nd> there is no reason for me to use, getScript
[19:09:42] <jphase> kongthap: make a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do
[19:09:55] <b1nd> maybe I should just use two script tags one for my plugins and one for my function, and then wait until document ready in order to execute the foo()?
[19:10:01] <kongthap> jphase, ok please wait :)
[19:10:02] <jphase> b1nd: getScript isn't a conventional way to load js if you're loading it off of the same server, no
[19:10:24] <jphase> I mean, you *can* use getScript, but why not just use a script tag?
[19:10:44] <jphase> b1nd: precisely
[19:11:04] <LoneStar99> hello
[19:11:56] <jphase> b1nd: if you're looking into something where you need to load dependencies perhaps you should check out requirejs.org
[19:12:36] <jphase> hi LoneStar99
[19:18:30] <bowenac> cool that wasnt bad
[19:18:34] <bowenac> got the google cal working
[19:20:47] <b1nd> Okay so do you think a script tag <script> would be a good way
[19:21:17] <b1nd> yes I have used require.js and yepnope before works good for loading things *on time*
[19:21:42] <b1nd> however, if I did not want to do this then I could put in some <script> tags and then this would also solve the issue?
[19:22:17] <kongthap> jphase, http://jsfiddle.net/jeud/bnx94/, on jsfiddle there is no undo at all but in machine the input has spinnig button, and it undo to empty not the previous value
[19:22:21] <jphase> b1nd: yeah, no need to load js in an unconventional way unless you're doing something unconventional ;)
[19:22:22] <b1nd> since when the page is rendered by the browser, it stops at the <script> renders then moves on to the next <script> tag right? so then all scripts are loaded when I call the document ready?
[19:25:02] <jphase> kongthap: for lack of a better understanding of what you're doing... http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/bnx94/1/
[19:26:06] <jphase> b1nd: correct, it's synchronous loading... that's why you'll notice including libraries from google or other external sources, sometimes they'll hang until the file loads
[19:26:44] <b1nd> what happens if one of them fails to load, like lets say some type of crazy ad
[19:26:49] <b1nd> will it break the full page then?
[19:28:14] <jphase> it will try for awhile, and most likely break everything js-related on your page after the call to that function if it throws a nasty error
[19:28:28] <jphase> definitely makes IE fail in lots of cases
[19:29:11] <kongthap> jphase, thanks for you jsfiddle, but it always undo to 0, i tried to console.log $("xxx").change(), with var previous_bet_amount = $(this).prev().val(); it got "undefine" instead of any value
[19:33:40] <bowenac> jphase do you remember or know how to check if className = on the eventClick using fullcalendar
[19:36:42] <kongthap> jphase, my understanding is inside $("xxx").change() it means "after change" can we still get the previous value ?
[19:38:00] <jphase> sorry, stepped out for a bit
[19:38:34] <jphase> bowenac: not off hand no, I bet their API docs has something in there on the click event to refer to the element though
[19:40:27] <jangoh> I am trying to play/pause youtube video when any div is active like this http://www.corriere.it/reportage/esteri/2014/la-grande-fuga-new-york/ . Is there any other example like this?
[19:40:30] <jphase> kongthap: no, you'd have to set the previous value in a variable. perhaps you're needing different events
[19:41:20] <kongthap> jphase, any event fires for before change
[19:41:35] <jphase> kongthap: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/bnx94/2/
[19:42:24] <jphase> kongthap: that top line should actually be var original_amount = $('input.txt_bet').val();
[19:42:48] <kongthap> jphase, i will try from your jsfiddle :)
[19:45:11] <jphase> bowenac: try using the "view" param (3rd param) on the eventClick event to refer to the original element to check if it has a class
[19:46:12] <bowenac> tried that with if (event.className == 'google-events') {
[19:46:16] <bowenac> doesnt trigger
[19:46:42] <bowenac> added class google-events to the google events source
[19:47:00] <bowenac> and eventClick: function(event, element, view) is what I am using
[19:47:30] <bowenac> maybe I can just do if $this.hasClass lol
[19:49:33] <bowenac> that works
[19:49:44] <bowenac> not sure why event.className doesnt
[19:50:36] <jphase> beat me to it, yeah it looks like the event.className array is empty on my jsfiddle
[19:50:59] <jphase> must be for additional classes that are added rather than the ones added by fullcal
[19:51:09] <jangoh> I am trying to play a video when the div is active whats the jquery syntax for this?
[19:51:14] <kongthap> jphase, the problem is the input box has spinning button, when click the spinning button, on focus does not fire :(
[19:52:25] <jphase> kongthap: add a click event to the spinning button that does $('input.txt_bet').focus();
[19:52:26] <jphase> ;)
[19:53:45] <kongthap> jphase, i really don't know about this, the spinning button come with bootstrap, what you meant is attatch on click to $(".input.txt_bet") right?
[19:54:15] <jphase> kongthap: no, to whatever the spinning icon from bootstrap is
[19:54:16] <kongthap> jphase, i meant the spinning button is part of input box
[19:55:24] <jphase> kongthap: have an example you can show me of the spinning button?
[19:55:25] <kongthap> jphase, i just tried to inspect the element, there is no separate elements or icons
[19:55:47] <kongthap> jphase, i will caputre the screen and element inspector for you
[19:58:10] <jphase> kongthap: $('.input-group .spinner .btn').on('click', function() { $(this).closest('.input-group').children('input').focus(); });
[19:58:23] <jphase> (using http://codepen.io/Thomas-Lebeau/pen/csHqx as an example of your spinner buttons)
[19:58:54] <jphase> also, instead of the focus event entirely you could just bind the event to those button clicks too btw
[19:59:19] <kongthap> jphase, that's great because i cannot capture the spinner it only apears when mouse hover it
[20:05:18] <bowenac> jphase you still around... what do you think would be the best option for inserting users google feed. Can I add that as user_meta. Doesnt seem like something I would need a table for
[20:05:35] <bowenac> yea that will work
[20:05:37] <jphase> bowenac: most definitely
[20:07:30] <bowenac> jphase cool, im just going to show an extra button on the create event modal that says add google calendar
[20:08:20] <bowenac> jphase if one exists for the user change it to edit gcal or something
[20:08:48] <jphase> or you could give them the ability to add/del/manage several feeds ;)
[20:09:20] <jphase> you're probably going to need to have a menu page or submenu page for that plugin eventually anyhow to manage settings and prefs
[20:17:35] <th3m1773n> Hello all!
[20:19:32] <jphase> hi
[20:23:26] <th3m1773n> I'm trying to override a jQuery WYSIWYG editor (Redactor)'s default behaviours. As a JS/jQuery n00b, I was wondering if there is a way to override a method from a "prototyped" in another script?
[20:23:46] <th3m1773n> I'm trying to override _imageSet, right here: https://github.com/dybskiy/redactor-js/blob/master/redactor/redactor.js#L3319
[20:24:08] <th3m1773n> Sorry if my question is a bit hazy, I will try to clarify if needed!
[20:24:17] <bowenac> jphase yea I was going to do that, was curious if there is a way to add a user setting under profile menu or what would be a good way to do that.
[20:25:11] <jphase> bowenac: on some of my plugins I've done user stuff with I add submenu pages to the users menu or do a section in the profile itself depending on how complex the interface is
[20:25:31] <bowenac> jphase yea reading about adding feilds to the user profile page
[20:25:39] <bowenac> never done that before
[20:25:43] <jphase> th3m1773n: yes, you can override a prototype function on the instance itself
[20:27:16] <th3m1773n> Great! But how do I reach the instance from another script?
[20:28:04] <jphase> th3m1773n: after the redactor editor is bound to the element I'm sure the prototypes are attached to the element itself, so you probably can access the instances with the same selector you used with your .redactor() method
[20:28:41] <th3m1773n> jphase: alright! And I just re-declare the method?
[20:29:17] <th3m1773n> as in this._imageSet = function () { yada yada yada} ?
[20:29:21] <jphase> yeah, like... redactorobject.prototype._imageSet = function(){ }   (you'll have to console.log that to make sure that's the right spot for it first though)
[20:29:33] <th3m1773n> yay!
[20:29:46] <th3m1773n> You have no idea what your answer means to me
[20:30:05] <jphase> I <3 redactor btw, wish they would've kept it open source :[
[20:30:34] <th3m1773n> Yeah it's awesome! Very clean and uncluttered
[20:30:56] <jphase> I was almost done ridding wordpress of tinymce with redactor, binded to the media gallery and everything and then they released their licensing :(
[20:31:00] <th3m1773n> but yeah, the closed source means that the average joe can't edit Redactor beyond the API
[20:31:05] <th3m1773n> aaawww
[20:31:43] <jphase> don't get me wrong, developers need to make their money and it's a great product, but I wasn't about to pay for a dev license on it to release a free wordpress plugin
[20:32:02] <th3m1773n> however I understand that having paid the $99 fee, you get complete access to the source, and unlimited support
[20:32:06] <th3m1773n> yeah of course
[20:32:20] <th3m1773n> so imperavi are still good people ^^
[20:48:14] <CrowX-> In this code, http://jsfiddle.net/mnq7k/  how do I get the onload function to run on every change of the src, and not just the first one?
[20:48:54] <CrowX-> wrong link. http://jsfiddle.net/mnq7k/1/
[20:49:52] <th3m1773n> jphase: So this is what I have from the Chrome console: http://i.imgur.com/CzBeGiK.png
[20:50:08] <th3m1773n> So I guess I targeted the object properly right?
[20:52:54] <Kamuela> my favorite part of being on ubuntu is IRC
[20:53:07] <CrowX-> anyone please?
[20:53:12] <CrowX-> Kamuela, there's irc on any OS
[20:53:47] <jphase> th3m1773n: you'll probably have to do something like var blah = $('.input-xlarge').redactor(); and access it from that
[20:54:01] <beancurd> wut.
[20:54:36] <th3m1773n> jphase: ah alright, let me see what I can make of that =)
[20:54:47] <th3m1773n> jphase: thank you very much for all your help
[20:54:53] <Kamuela> CrowX-: yeah but it's not setup on any other OS for me :) and it works so well on ubuntu ;)
[20:55:09] <CrowX-> :)
[20:55:54] <jangoh> Whats the jquery function to check ctive div?
[20:56:00] <jangoh> Whats the jquery function to check active div?
[20:56:20] <beancurd> err.
[20:56:26] <Kamuela> jangoh: I'm interested in hearing someone's answer because that doesn't make sense to me exactly
[20:56:36] <beancurd> jangoh: .hasClass("active"); ?
[20:56:44] <beancurd> ... i'm making wild assumptions here.
[20:57:08] <Kamuela> jangoh: What do you mean by active, btw? And what do you mean by check? Define those and I think we can help
[20:57:38] <jangoh> i mean when the div is in my screen that i see
[20:57:54] <jangoh> div's context exactly
[20:58:22] <beancurd> oh, i was so wrong with my assumption.
[20:59:44] <beancurd> https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear <- this will help.
[21:01:07] <jangoh> yes thats i am looking for thanx beancurd
[21:02:56] <Kamuela> beancurd: hey awesome, I didn't know about such a thing
[21:03:37] <beancurd> :D
[21:03:46] <jphase> jangoh: I think you're actually just looking for document.activeElement ;)
[21:04:06] <CrowX-> In this code, http://jsfiddle.net/mnq7k/1/  how do I get the onload function to run on every change of the src, and not just the first one?
[21:04:19] <jangoh> yup and jquery to select ;p
[21:08:05] <jphase> CrowX-: the issue you're having is because the attr changing is happening synchronously
[21:08:59] <jphase> CrowX-: the event is firing on the last one because the first two never got a chance to load
[21:09:21] <CrowX-> I see
[21:09:37] <CrowX-> jphase, ok, let's imagine that I fire them on a click event
[21:09:57] <jphase> then as long as you don't spam click, they'd all fire ;)
[21:10:10] <CrowX-> jphase, how do I get an event that starts when the new image starts getting loaded?
[21:10:24] <jphase> CrowX-: put it inside the load function and chain them
[21:10:30] <jphase> or something like that anyhow
[21:10:52] <CrowX-> that's a good idea
[21:11:09] <jphase> you can use deferred stuff to do that
[21:22:27] <mordof> when i'm doing $.ajax({ dataType: "json" }) <-- can i still do that but prevent it from attempting to parse the JSON for me?
[21:23:47] <jphase> mordof: no, that will expect a json object and parse it for you
[21:24:05] <jphase> unless it's bunk data of course ;)
[21:25:03] <mordof> alright - i'll take that out and do it a different way
[21:25:11] <mordof> not every response returns data
[21:25:17] <jangoh> found the waypoints plugin fir me :>
[21:25:23] <mordof> and it's "failing" when it's a success even though no data is necessary.. and it's annoying
[21:53:14] <mordof> bah.. even when i take that out and control the headers myself it still gives an "unexpected end of input"
[21:53:20] <mordof> this is frustrating.
[21:53:44] <mordof> i don't want any message sent back! is there no way to tell jquery "stop looking for a message body"?
[21:53:58] <mordof> or.. trying to parse one
[21:57:49] <mordof> nevermind. i guess i have to explicitly tell it dataType: "text" and then parse it if there's something there.
[22:06:09] <Voyage> If I have a form to submit for some user information updation. The form has two submit buttons. one is 'save' and the other is 'delete'. How can / should I handle two submit types buttons that act differently ?
[22:09:51] <jangoh> I am following this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2128535/stop-a-youtube-video-with-jquery  cant play embeded youtube video :/

[22:18:33] <jangoh> http://jsfiddle.net/vexsZ/1/  here is my works
[22:27:59] <Voyage> never mind. I got the solution
[23:09:47] <jangoh>  finally got this youtube api working : http://jsfiddle.net/vexsZ/14/
[23:09:52] <jangoh> :D
[23:14:35] <decx> don't put script tags in the js area :>
[23:17:06] <jangoh> it was copy paste :p
[23:17:49] <decx> you can load the player api asynchronously
[23:20:48] <jangoh> i am playing with api n
