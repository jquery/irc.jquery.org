[00:14:36] <snimavat> Does any one know why $('#form').submit() does not work, here's the form markup http://pastebin.com/M6MaY3dt
[00:15:26] <krambiorix> hi guys
[00:15:39] <krambiorix> i use qtip to open a tooltip on a page, it opens but it can't hide... Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/bpBaYQTE
[00:20:29] <krambiorix> anyone?
[00:22:05] <snimavat> Any idea why form.submit() does not work ?
[00:32:00] <ichibiri> in Drupal 7.10, why my mobile_jquery theme doesn't display logo pic in the header, as set in that theme's conf? :(  Have <Back> button in the header where the logo pic is normally shown :)  Looking at it with Android's default browser
[00:34:41] <blackice2999> ichibiri: why not ask in #drupal #drupal-support ?
[00:36:15] <ichibiri> blackice2999:  i did, tho no1 knows, yet :)
[00:37:06] <blackice2999> ichibiri: it sounds for me like a simple css problem
[00:39:03] <ichibiri> blackice2999: the only thing that I noticed is that the mobile_jquery page.tpl.php calls .class header, but there's none defined in the theme's style.css. This maybe why I cannot see logo in the header. Working on it now
[01:08:52] <mattyh88> how do you count the amount of chars in a textbox?
[01:09:07] <mattyh88> i'm using length() but it keeps returning 1 instead of 4 (because i typed "azer")
[01:10:24] <progzer> Maybe you shouldn't be using the parenthesis ()
[01:11:04] <mattyh88> oh right i'm not :), just typed it wrong here :p
[01:11:15] <mattyh88> this is what i have now: $("#color_color").val().length
[01:12:22] <mattyh88> oh got it now ... apparently i shouldn't do this:
[01:12:23] <mattyh88> alert("chars in color textbox: " + $("#color_color").val().length);
[01:12:52] <mattyh88> oh it does work
[01:12:53] <mattyh88> strange
[01:12:58] <mattyh88> with that sring in front
[01:17:18] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/x7kucckrrjucnhhzgvkldg - something is wrong, the to-datepicker should only be able to select dates in the future of the from-datepicker, however, it's the opposite, I can only choose dates in the past
[01:23:19] <nisseni> nvm, got it
[01:28:42] <AdvoWork> is it possible to somehow limit the content/text within a list menu option with jquery? most entries are fine but ive got a few that are massive and totally mess the page layout out as the option is so long
[01:31:35] <Wiggin> greetings
[01:38:09] <krz> what type of fading animation is this: http://noisetrade.com/
[01:38:20] <krz> the huge banner that fades to another
[01:41:58] <logicrises> pratchett.freenode.net, you could loop through the options and limit the characters.
[01:43:15] <Wiggin> uh krz that's pretty simple, just fadeout one image while fading in another?
[01:43:30] <progzer> Is it bad to have form elements without forms on a page? I have a chat text box and a button to submit that. At certain times there is an additional radio button list and button
[01:43:38] <progzer> (to send the selected item)
[01:43:58] <logicrises> AdvoWork, you could loop through the options and limit the characters
[01:44:24] <progzer> I handle the enter key in the textbox for chat. But at times when the "question" area is displayed, focus may shift from the chat text box to the radio buttons.
[01:44:46] <progzer> The user presses enter to send the chat message but instead ends up sending an option for the question.
[01:45:09] <Wiggin> progzer: the form element is mostly there to group all the fields together for submission, so I don't see anything wrong with that from a practical standpoint
[01:45:32] <Wiggin> as for good practice, on the other hand, I'll have to defer to someone who practices it :P
[01:45:35] <progzer> Can I just bind keyup on the div containing the radio list and its submission button.
[01:46:20] <progzer> But from what I read about event bubling, it will propogate up from the button to the div
[01:46:22] <Wiggin> why does the focus shift to the radio buttons?
[01:46:54] <progzer> The radio buttons come in as the result of an ajax request
[01:48:05] <Wiggin> so the browser automatically shift the focus?
[01:50:35] <progzer> That's the behavior I noticed (and got a "I pressed enter to send a message, but the answer was submit instead" bug report)
[01:51:03] <Wiggin> you could try using focus to shift it back to the textbox
[01:51:05] <Wiggin> ?focus
[01:51:06] <bot-t> .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[01:51:49] <progzer> I guess I've answered my question by speaking out that part about bubling - I can just bind keyup to the button itself
[01:52:19] <progzer> Or keeping track of focus before the question comes in is also a good idea, thanks.
[02:02:22] <Anticom2> hi all
[02:02:35] <Anticom2> how do i check, if a variable is defined?
[02:02:41] <AdvoWork> is there a way to style option elements or limit them without checking each entry?  for a <select> menu?
[02:02:55] <Anticom2> i want to check, wether .attr("id") has any content, or not
[02:04:01] <aaronmcadam> Anticom2: $('#id').length
[02:04:14] <aaronmcadam> if ( ..length) { ...,. }
[02:05:13] <Anticom2> but $('#id') would return the jq-object with the matched elements having an id = 'id' o.O
[02:05:15] <Anticom2> wouldn't it?!
[02:05:21] <aaronmcadam> what?
[02:05:44] <Anticom2> i want to check wether the id ATTRIBUTE is defined or not
[02:05:48] <Anticom2> --> .attr()
[02:05:50] <aaronmcadam> kk
[02:06:03] <aaronmcadam> if $('kddd')[0].id
[02:06:10] <aaronmcadam> that would work
[02:06:25] <aaronmcadam> no need to use attr
[02:06:37] <aaronmcadam> ?tias
[02:06:37] <bot-t> Try It And See
[02:06:41] <Anticom2> but i'm iterating through dom elements using a foreach loop
[02:06:52] <aaronmcadam> don't u mean $.each
[02:06:57] <Anticom2> nope
[02:07:02] <Anticom2> custom foreach loop ;)
[02:07:16] <aaronmcadam> you can't use foreach safely cross browser, ah k
[02:07:16] <Anticom2> i have to iterate through them backwards (:
[02:07:34] <Anticom2> $.each can do what i want, ah k
[02:07:50] <aaronmcadam> wheel.reinvent = null;
[02:08:23] <Anticom2> why have we argue about how i am solving problems, huh?!
[02:08:32] <Anticom2> i just wanted to know how to check, wether a variable is defined or not
[02:08:40] <Anticom2> what's the matter of flaming around now?
[02:09:17] <StPiere> does anyone use lowpro for jquery ?
[02:09:28] <aaronmcadam> Anticom2: I'm not flaming you calm down
[02:09:39] <aaronmcadam> Anticom2: I've already told u the answer
[02:10:13] <Anticom2> so if() is not executed, if value of condition is undefined?
[02:10:24] <aaronmcadam> ...
[02:10:34] <StPiere> i cant access behavior instance from event on<event>
[02:11:02] <StPiere> doc says it should be this , but this is the actual DOM element

[02:13:21] <aaronmcadam> are you using the library called Klass?
[02:13:47] <krambiorix> i use qtip to open a tooltip on a page, it opens but it can't hide... Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/bpBaYQTE
[02:17:58] <DoDoNL> Hello all. I want to run the animate() method twice at the same time, but when I do (I enlarge an input element and enlarge it's holder), the holder animates, but the input element hides and then shows again at the new width. This also happens on another place in the website, where I dyanamically open and hide the submenu. I animate the height and to make the element fit I set the width of...
[02:18:00] <DoDoNL> ...the element before
[02:19:41] <woozly> guys, how to trigger/handle drop out of div? (with .sortable) ?
[02:20:58] <EugenA> if i'm using latest jquery, can i do like this? $(document).ready(function() {  ... });
[02:49:52] <GyroB> hello
[02:50:55] <larsemil> EugenA: yes
[02:51:42] <GyroB> i have done some research on google about blocking dialog, but nothing works... it is really possible to wait for a button response to keep running javascript?
[02:52:15] <RLa> i doubt
[02:52:36] <RLa> if you need to execute some code in the background, use workers
[02:53:14] <RLa> or use modal overlay, not confirm or such function
[02:57:17] <GyroB> the problem is that i'm using a map based app and i have some events associated with features ('beforefeaturemodified','featuremodified'), i want the dialog in beforefeaturemodified and block code untill dialog returns something... but featuremodified is fired before that
[02:57:23] <GyroB> any thoughts?
[02:59:59] <Charliemo> hi everyone got a quick question if thats ok
[03:00:06] <dr0id> not ok
[03:01:11] <diverdude> Does html5 offer improved file upload facilities such as progress indicator or multiple file selection or should a 3rd party still be used for proper handling of these basic demands?
[03:01:16] <Charliemo> I'm currently working in Drupal 7 and trying to use Jquery autocomplete with a geo request for google maps ie enter an address in a search box possible matches found user selects
[03:01:43] <Charliemo> problem is if there is a # symbol in the URL everything breaks
[03:02:26] <Charliemo> dr0id: Okay whys that?
[03:04:29] <aidan_> hey guys could anyone help me with a jquery mootools conflict issue
[03:04:38] <dr0id> ?noConflict
[03:04:38] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[03:10:02] <Charliemo> anyone at all??
[03:12:23] <aidan_> dr0id: http://pastie.org/3045766
[03:12:27] <aidan_> correct?
[03:15:21] <CamiloZZ> Y esto?
[03:16:02] <Charliemo> anyone know why # symbol in url breaks Jquery UI?
[03:17:42] <CamiloZZ> Y ahora ingles?
[03:26:07] <dr0id> aidan_: yes
[03:26:33] <Clorith> Does anyone know of a wysiwyg editor that can be attached to more then one element on the same page ? (say two textareas for example)
[03:26:59] <aidan_> dr0id: having difficulty bud
[03:27:10] <aidan_> http://pastie.org/3045824
[03:27:45] <dr0id> Clorith: did you google ?
[03:27:52] <Clorith> I did of course
[03:28:22] <ianyo> Clorith, surely $("#textarea1").tinyMCE(); $("#textarea2").tinyMCE();
[03:28:24] <dr0id> aidan_: what difficulty ? $.noConflict(); not sure why you doin jQuery.noConflict()
[03:28:35] <ianyo> or w/e it is to invoke tinymce
[03:28:43] <Clorith> well ideally I'd do $(".textarea").tineMCE() or similar
[03:28:56] <Clorith> isnt' tinymce the pay2use one though?
[03:28:57] <dr0id> that works
[03:29:01] <Clorith> (I've been using CKEditor mostly)
[03:29:01] <dr0id> heh
[03:29:13] <dr0id> and it doesn't work with 2 textareas ?
[03:29:18] <aidan_> dr0id: becuase i have a conflict with jquery and mootools
[03:29:21] <Clorith> indeed not
[03:29:24] <aidan_> the jquery stops my image slider from loading
[03:29:33] <Clorith> 2nd textarea is just that; a plain textarea
[03:29:46] <ablomen> Clorith, no, it has some payed official modules (file manager etc) but tinymce itself is free and os
[03:29:52] <aidan_> so im using no conflict but if i change that code to div=show then my first image appears but no slideshow still
[03:29:57] <kybalion> hi
[03:30:00] <Clorith> oh, nice, I might try that then =)
[03:30:12] <kybalion> is there a way to put multiple plugins on a page without conflicts?
[03:30:22] <ianyo> don't see why it wouldnt work, Clorith
[03:30:31] <ianyo> I've used it for multiple textareas before
[03:30:32] <diverdude> is "multipart upload" the same as selection and upload of multiple files? Or what does multipart upload mean?
[03:30:40] <ianyo> without doing anything abnormal
[03:30:51] <kybalion> is there a way to put multiple plugins on a page without conflicts?
[03:31:18] <Clorith> diverdude, multipart is when it splits up the upload of a single file into many (for large files if there's an upload size limit for example)
[03:31:41] <diverdude> Clorith, ahh okay. thank you
[03:32:07] <dr0id> yeah
[03:32:18] <kybalion> is there a way to put multiple plugins on a page without conflicts?
[03:32:25] <dr0id> when the data is large, like files, it has to be split up into headers footer ,etc.
[03:32:44] <Clorith> kybalion, you should be able to have multiple plugins without them conflicting to begi nwith unless they use the same triggers
[03:32:46] <dr0id> try that plupload with multiple files and then check the post data sent in  ajax request in chrome dev tool or firebug
[03:33:03] <Clorith> I had ot disable the multipart on plupload, corrupted my images :(
[03:33:13] <Clorith> (not that I needed it to begin with, I was just playing around at that time)
[03:33:20] <kybalion> what i mean is this
[03:33:27] <kybalion> what do you mean use the same triggers
[03:33:43] <Clorith> if both plyugins are caled ith $.Plugin()
[03:33:47] <Clorith> they'll argue
[03:34:07] <dr0id> aidan_: dude, use $.noConflict();
[03:34:08] <kybalion> can u use coffeescript or something to make them not conflict?
[03:34:21] <kybalion> what is $.noconflict()
[03:34:23] <ianyo> kybalion,  make sure the order of your <script> tags is correct
[03:34:29] <aidan_> dr0id: I am trying to
[03:34:39] <dr0id> or yeah that should work too actually
[03:35:10] <dr0id> console.log $ in diff places and check the output
[03:35:15] <dr0id> later
[03:35:30] <ianyo> so before </body>, jquery -> plugin1 -> plugin2 -> script.js to invote the plugins
[03:36:51] <ianyo> *invoke
[03:46:27] <Nomikos> I'm using .hover() with two functions for over & out, is there a good way to share variables between these two functions without using global scope?
[03:47:18] <Nomikos> I was thinking something closure-like, but not sure how to apply that here.. esp since the hover() is used on many different elements which need different values
[03:51:11] <aidan> two aidan's ... that's confusing.
[03:51:28] <aidan_> heh
[03:51:51] <aidan_> im the one whos tearing hair out for future reference :p
[03:51:55] <aidan> :D
[03:57:28] <alex88> morning
[03:58:56] <antonjb> night...
[03:59:40] <xec> Nomikos: maybe you can use .data()
[04:00:03] <pluffsy> hi
[04:00:08] <xec> Nomikos: depending on what it is you want to share
[04:01:55] <pluffsy> I have this problem: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/radio-buttons-buttonset-doesn-t-work-in-ie8 radio buttons made into a buttonset not always updating the value in Explorer 7. Works like 50% of the times or something like that. Anyone with similar experiences?
[04:02:34] <Nomikos> xec: data is a good idea
[04:03:13] <Nomikos> And I will remember that for a time when I will actually need to do what I described, instead of being confused :-p
[04:04:08] <Nomikos> Since the values were not only different per element but also depending on the duration of the mouseover, they still had to be recalculated each time
[04:04:31] <xec> you lost me :)
[04:04:50] <Nomikos> ehrm :-) yeah, it's.. I'll put it live and link.
[04:05:49] <dr0id> diverdude: yes
[04:09:16] <diverdude> dr0id, So can i make one layout and that layout will be used whatever technology plupload chooses?
[04:09:44] <dr0id> umm,yes
[04:09:44] <Nomikos> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/CTL4K/
[04:09:54] <dr0id> plupload will auto choose what tech to use
[04:09:57] <Demp> hi, I have a list with map arrays like so: [{'z': '3'}, {'z': '5'}, {'z': '2'}] and I want to sort the list in order of 'z' ascending. any idea how?
[04:10:24] <diverdude> dr0id, but if i make custom ui, will that be applied to all techs?
[04:11:14] <Nomikos> The animation speed on over & out had to depend on the length of the text (it has to be readable on mouseover still), and on mouseout it should depend on "how far in" it was, so it doesn't take too long but doesn't snap back either
[04:13:08] <xec> Nomikos: okay... it looks pretty decent as it is now - you fixed it already?
[04:13:21] <Nomikos> Demp: the Array.sort() method takes an optional function with which you can define a custom sort order
[04:13:36] <Nomikos> xec: yeah I think so
[04:14:31] <Nomikos> Demp: does that help?
[04:15:11] <SoulRaven> hi
[04:15:44] <SoulRaven> anyone knows any jquery plugin that use jquery themeing and generate vertical multilevel menus?
[04:16:09] <Nomikos> SoulRaven: like http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ ?
[04:17:43] <SoulRaven> Nomikos: not acordeon, i mean menu, linke this http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ipod_style_and_flyout_menus/
[04:17:55] <SoulRaven> but the elements of the first level visibile
[04:18:07] <Nomikos> oh, dropdown menus?
[04:18:38] <SoulRaven> yes
[04:18:53] <SoulRaven> but vertical and that use jquery themes
[04:23:54] <Nomikos> They have an example where the second level is vertical, maybe you can hack it around a bit? http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/menus/flyout.php
[04:35:57] <AdvoWork> if im passing variables using post() and one of those contains an & ie test&test2  which is inserting into a dB as test   how do i escape/encode it, whats the best one to use?
[04:37:02] <SoulRaven> i will bot with encode/decode
[04:37:20] <SoulRaven> then mysql escape on server side
[04:38:08] <beasty> hmm
[04:39:55] <AdvoWork> ive just tried encodeURI() but still saves weirdly
[04:47:56] <Nomikos> AdvoWork: got some code to see? usually .post() takes care of encoding for you
[04:54:58] <Deele> anyone experienced with jstree?
[04:55:18] <Deele> how to make an item change its icon?
[04:55:35] <Deele> I mean, how to use .set_type
[04:59:57] <diverdude> can PLUpload (GPLv2 license) be used on a webpage which is built on top of a MIT license framwork where users pay to use the site?
[05:00:56] <gloomer> lawyer up
[05:01:07] <spliter> hello. Need help with a node cloning, but can't find an easy answer. So, I have a node, that I want to clone. The clone should be inserted in the DOM right after the original node. Appending to the parent doesn't work, because the original node is not the last in the parent's children list
[05:01:28] <spliter> any hints?
[05:01:33] <StPiere> is there some jquery standard method to sheck element type, like DIV or INPUT ?
[05:01:59] <Nomikos> spliter: if you're just looking for the placement part,  .after() I think
[05:02:54] <Nomikos> or insertAfter(), if it follows the clone itself (and the target is the original)
[05:03:05] <spliter> Nomikos: any example of it's usage in this scenario? I can't think of how to use neither after() nor insertAfter()
[05:03:13] <digitalfiz> StPiere: i believe its .tagName
[05:03:23] <Nomikos> spliter: what are you using to clone?
[05:03:34] <spliter> Nomikos: clone()
[05:03:47] <Nomikos> good answer :p never used that myself, sec
[05:06:17] <ahandy> question, how can i make a div slide to the left of the page and then hide itself :d animate with width toggle doesn't have the effect that i'm looking for (dont want to the width to change, just want the div as a whole to slide)
[05:06:44] <Nomikos> spliter: var x = $(this).clone(); x.insertAfter($(this));
[05:07:02] <Nomikos> spliter: that should work inside your event function
[05:07:06] <gloomer> ahandy, just use .hide(400)
[05:07:09] <gloomer> with a slide maybe
[05:07:15] <gloomer> altho i think .hide(400) will slide to left
[05:07:18] <gloomer> and fade
[05:07:51] <spliter> Nomikos: right. Doing with multiple lines. Was thinking about a one-liner though, but if it's impossible will do with those separate. Thanks Nomikos
[05:08:04] <Nomikos> ahandy: you can also look at animate({"left": -200}, 400); (for example)
[05:08:32] <ahandy> gloomer: yes, but the show() doesn't have a slide effect, more like a slideDown+slide event, and i dont like that :s
[05:09:28] <ahandy> Nomikos: not working for some reason
[05:09:44] <Nomikos> spliter: ok, $(this).clone().insertAfter($(this));  ;-)
[05:10:21] <Nomikos> ahandy: that's where you have to fiddle with things like position: relative; and stuff, I think.. not my strongest area, but I know you can animate position
[05:12:31] <Nomikos> spliter: also also, if you want to be able to re-clone cloned elements you have to use .live('event', .. instead of .event(..). And it clones the id value as well, just a heads-up
[05:12:48] * Nomikos should definitely stop procrastinating
[05:14:09] <spliter> Nomikos: $(this).clone().insertAfter($(this)) doesn't work. Apparently 'this' within after() and insertAfter() refers to document and not the processed node
[05:14:21] <ahandy> Nomikos: how would you suggest i keep the divs organized? meaning i have an arrow that would change the divs (using the animate slide function you gave me), but how would i hide the others? if i use display: none i'd have to show them and then slide them, no?
[05:14:41] <spliter> Nomikos: so, I will just use a proper function with multiple lines instead. Thanks
[05:17:48] <Nomikos> spliter: that's odd, it does its thing here http://jsfiddle.net/2sjNd/
[05:18:03] <krambiorix> i use qtip to open a tooltip on a page, it opens but it can't hide...It must be a simple mistake i guess... Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/bpBaYQTE
[05:18:29] <Nomikos> ahandy: animate() does not show hidden elements by itself
[05:20:48] <Nomikos> krambiorix: put up an example on jsfiddle.net ?
[05:21:48] <krambiorix> Nomikos, there's no qtip lib there?
[05:22:18] <spliter> Nomikos: consider this case â€” http://jsfiddle.net/spliter/gZ7vA/
[05:22:20] <Nomikos> krambiorix: ah, you can use the 'Add Resources' thinger in the sidebar
[05:22:31] <spliter> Nomikos: the code is run on $(window).load()
[05:23:06] <spliter> Nomikos: as you see the result should be that every image is cloned there. But it's not the case
[05:23:31] <Nomikos> spliter: ehrm, I'm still seeing my own code there, can you save/update?
[05:24:27] <spliter> :) right. Sorry
[05:24:59] <spliter> Nomikos: http://jsfiddle.net/spliter/gZ7vA/
[05:25:29] <Nomikos> spliter: ah, I see what you mean
[05:27:33] <krambiorix> Nomikos, can't make it work :s
[05:28:14] <krambiorix> Nomikos, the problem is here if($('#Email').data("qtip"))  -> can't find data("qtip") i guess
[05:28:41] <krambiorix> Nomikos, i'm trying to make this work already 2 days
[05:29:46] <Nomikos> spliter: I ehr.. revised it slightly ;-) http://jsfiddle.net/gZ7vA/3/ - that shows what you want I think
[05:30:09] <Nomikos> so basically add each() after find(), with a function inside (where $(this) will work) that runs on each found image
[05:30:21] <spliter> Nomikos: yes, that's exactly what I'm doing now
[05:30:32] <spliter> Nomikos: thanks
[05:30:38] <Nomikos> sorted then, np :)
[05:30:49] <Nomikos> krambiorix: do you have an example online?
[05:31:43] <krambiorix> Nomikos, nope just on my computer
[05:32:47] <krambiorix> Nomikos, i just think there goes something wrong when closing. So first i attach the qtip on the div with id="Email" and then i want to close it with : $('#Email').qtip("hide"); but its like the qtip hasn't been attached to the div
[05:34:00] <Nomikos> $('.messageBody').data("qtip") checks for a data-qtip attribute in the class='messageBody' element, is that right?
[05:34:54] <krambiorix> Nomikos, i'm new to jquery but i assume so
[05:36:25] <krambiorix> Nomikos, the if($('.messageBody').data("qtip") isn't entered
[05:38:31] <Nomikos> krambiorix: can you put the relevant html in the html box here? http://jsfiddle.net/bs6UJ/1/
[05:39:20] <Nomikos> then hit update and post the new url
[05:39:27] * Nomikos runs to get more coffee
[05:39:38] <krambiorix> Nomikos, you'll need it :D
[05:40:10] <beasty> mm
[05:40:28] <beasty> $('.ui-button:even').click(function() { $(this).next('.ui-button').css('background', '#4CA20B'); });
[05:40:33] <beasty> what am i doing wrong ?
[05:42:43] <krambiorix> Nomikos, i updated it
[05:42:52] <krambiorix> you want me to add the resource for qtip?
[05:43:42] <Nomikos> it should be in there, can I have the url?
[05:44:25] <krambiorix> Nomikos, http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/packages/1.0.0-rc3/jquery.qtip-1.0.0-rc3.js
[05:44:46] <Nomikos> I meant the jsfiddle one, but I guess http://jsfiddle.net/bs6UJ/2/ works?
[05:45:25] <Nomikos> or http://jsfiddle.net/bs6UJ/3/
[05:45:44] <Nomikos> ok first id='messageBody' should be #messageBody in jquery, .messageBody refers to a class
[05:45:47] <StPiere> im want to make some simple plugin ... any idea why this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/Vy3GM/1/ ??
[05:46:31] <Nomikos> krambiorix: and moduleBaseUrl is not defined, here
[05:47:43] <krambiorix> Nomikos, *updated* but doesn't run
[05:47:46] <Nomikos> hrm.. try to get a simpler example working first?
[05:47:47] <StPiere> anyone ?
[05:48:00] <krambiorix> Nomikos, well that thing works on my computer
[05:48:13] <krambiorix> Nomikos, it's just the closing the qtip part that doesn't work
[05:48:41] <vainoharhainen> I use jquery validator on a "dynamic" form there i add inputs with javascript. But i dont get the validator to work on the items i insert with javascript.
[05:48:47] <vainoharhainen> Is it possible to use live or on?
[05:49:06] <Nomikos> krambiorix: don't know then :-/ too little I can try from here
[05:49:35] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: .live() should work nicely for dynamically added elements
[05:49:51] <krambiorix> Nomikos, but would this be correct ? if($('#messageBody').data("qtip"))  ?
[05:50:37] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: dont get it to work correclty have you any ide how i sould use the live. jQuery("form").live('', jQuery("form").validate());  or how hrmm
[05:50:48] <Nomikos> krambiorix: syntax is fine. It should run /if/ there is an element like this: <div id="messageBody" data-qtip="1">
[05:51:24] <krambiorix> Nomikos, i don't have the data-qtip="1"
[05:51:44] <Nomikos> krambiorix: then .data('qtip') will return Undefined and the function will not run
[05:52:45] <Nomikos> are you sure you need to use .data() though? what is that if() supposed to check?
[05:52:59] <krambiorix> Nomikos,  the if is being entered
[05:53:07] <krambiorix> Nomikos, with the data-qtip="1"
[05:53:20] <krambiorix> Nomikos, but the $('#Email').qtip("hide");   doesn't work....
[05:53:25] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: you use .live() with events, like live("click", function..  instead of .click(function..
[05:53:47] <krambiorix> Nomikos, so this is my html div: <div id="Email" data-qtip="1">
[05:54:26] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: okey then hrmm
[05:55:02] <solsTiCe> hi. I am using some code like that: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/523527/ is there something more elegant to manipulate the id in jquery ?
[05:56:03] <Nomikos> krambiorix: I don't know anything about qtip, I'd suggest you get a simple example working first, maybe starting from demo code
[05:57:54] <krambiorix> Nomikos, okay, thx for your help though!
[05:58:00] <Nomikos> np
[05:58:08] <krambiorix> Nomikos, and enjoy that coffee!
[05:58:28] * Nomikos blinks, spots the now cooling mug, drinks
[05:59:11] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: got it to work now.
[05:59:32] <vainoharhainen> vainoharhainen: have you any ide how the validator plugin works?
[05:59:37] <vainoharhainen> lol
[05:59:39] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: *
[06:00:23] <vainoharhainen> If i want it to load everytime i add / remove a element.
[06:00:24] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: ehrm.. can't say I have, no
[06:00:27] <vainoharhainen> okey
[06:00:37] <vainoharhainen> bc now its just check when i press submit
[06:00:39] <vainoharhainen> but i will play with it.
[06:00:41] <vainoharhainen> Thansk anyways!
[06:00:46] <Nomikos> good luck! :-)
[06:03:23] <vainoharhainen> Hm not working damn.
[06:09:20] <ShawnRisk> I am getting this error: TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'centerdata.markers') on line 16 with this code: http://pastebin.com/v1CGE2Hh
[06:10:01] <astropirate> ShawnRisk, centerdata = jQuery.parseJSON(centerdata);
[06:10:09] <astropirate> its most likely malformed json
[06:10:27] <astropirate> use jsonlint to  verify the output of centerdata = centerdata.replace(/},]/,"}]");
[06:12:31] <ShawnRisk> astropirate: I entered the data into jsonlint and got Array size is not a small enough positive integer.
[06:13:27] <astropirate> ShawnRisk, what?
[06:13:30] <iamcurio> anyone know how to add a simple line animation like on this site: http://www.arsthanea.com/ - see the View Services link
[06:13:34] <mathi> hi
[06:13:50] <mathi> is it possible to get the time an ajax request took in ms ?
[06:13:57] <ShawnRisk> astropirate: wasn't I suppose to use: http://jsonlint.com/
[06:14:38] <purefusion_> would anyone here consider it bad form to create somewhat complex html code using something like:
[06:14:41] <purefusion_>  $('<li data-categories="'+categories+'">'+tag+'<a data-project="'+name+'"><span class="'+style+'"><img src="'+thumb+'" alt="'+title+'"><span><h6>'+title+'</h6></a></li>');
[06:15:34] <purefusion_> and if so, is there a better, or cleaner approach? or would you opt for this, if it's better where performance is concerned?
[06:18:50] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: Is it possible to get the new elements someother way? force it to recheck
[06:19:30] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: if the validate plugin has a function you can call at arbitrary moments, you could call it after you add a new element
[06:19:53] <Nomikos> or I guess you want to bind it to each new element, as it is added
[06:20:17] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: im thinking of make a own validator insted.
[06:20:19] <ShawnRisk> astropirate: any other thoughts?
[06:20:27] <Nomikos> that works
[06:20:37] <vainoharhainen> just jQuery("form .required).each(function() if(val=='')
[06:21:01] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: that code will not work bc it dont got the new elements
[06:21:11] <vainoharhainen> have you any good ide what i can use
[06:21:52] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: that should work if run right before submit?
[06:22:05] <Nomikos> if the newly added elements have class 'required'
[06:22:15] <vainoharhainen> they got "required" but not working anyways =/
[06:22:24] <vainoharhainen> 2spec i past my code
[06:22:31] <g0rd0n> is there a way to set contents to an iframe? i saw there is .contents() but it only reads, i need something to write
[06:26:05] <ShawnRisk> g0rd0n: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/997986/write-elements-into-a-child-iframe-using-javascript-or-jquery
[06:26:09] <vainoharhainen> Nomikos: http://pastebin.com/59PJ7JzD
[06:26:16] <vainoharhainen> i tested with live too on the click event.
[06:29:24] <xec> vainoharhainen: it's usually more efficient to debug a live example, including relevant html. you can make one at jsfiddle.net
[06:29:33] <ShawnRisk> mathi: yes, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6840140/jquery-ajax-call-with-a-timer
[06:29:55] <g0rd0n> ShawnRisk: thanks
[06:30:32] <g0rd0n> actually i was thinkning of a more elgant way to do what i want, but then i would need to pass some stuff via POST to the iframe. is it possible?
[06:30:48] <ShawnRisk> purefusion_: where does the span end?
[06:30:57] <xec> vainoharhainen: you aren't passing any parameters to the event handler btw, maybe swap ".live('click', function()..." with ."live('click', function(event)..."
[06:31:23] <vainoharhainen> xec: okey i fixed the each now.
[06:31:33] <vainoharhainen> But i will come back bc i think i want to use validator plugin anyways
[06:31:39] <vainoharhainen> sould just make a good example code.
[06:33:37] <Nomikos> vainoharhainen: I think the issue was that 'event' was not defined
[06:33:38] <ShawnRisk> g0rd0n: it is possible but not sure it is right
[06:34:03] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: good catch, that last one's supposed to be </span>
[06:34:38] <ShawnRisk> purefusion: I am wondering why use span when you only have image in there?
[06:35:05] <ShawnRisk> g0rd0n: what about this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663973/cant-write-to-dynamic-iframe-using-jquery
[06:35:22] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: because there's a background image behind the image
[06:36:01] <g0rd0n> lol i didnt know i could do target in form
[06:36:04] * g0rd0n facepalm
[06:36:15] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: but nevertheless, I get the feeling that a good javascript developer would see that line and cringe
[06:36:19] <RLa> doesn't html5 ban frames?
[06:36:33] <ShawnRisk> purefusion: for sure
[06:36:35] <purefusion_> but I don't know, maybe that's permissable with jQ?
[06:36:53] <purefusion_> otherwise I'll be creating a bunch of new lines to replace it more cleanly
[06:36:59] <RLa> frames have all kinds of trouble with same-origin-policy
[06:37:01] <purefusion_> which I suspect could be a performance hit
[06:37:44] <ShawnRisk> RLa: from what I read yes.
[06:38:49] <ShawnRisk> purefusion: just looks like a lot of HTML code for just tags, link, image, and title in a bullet.
[06:41:47] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: appearances can be deceiving, thanks to the magic of css :P
[06:43:00] <ShawnRisk> purefusion_: for sure.  Just one question do you have two nicknames on here?
[06:44:00] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: yep, right now I'm just accessing from another machine ;)
[06:44:08] <ShawnRisk> ok
[06:44:57] <vainoharhainen> xec: hm im not possible to get jsfiddle working correctly with jquery.validate plugin
[06:45:02] <purefusion_> ShawnRisk: so anyway, do you suggest I do the creation of said elements one at a time across several lines?
[06:45:35] <shomon> hi, I need to check with an onclick on a submit button, that certain fields are filled. This is regardless of "required" fields - it's kind of a last "all data there"? check
[06:45:46] <shomon> how could I do this?
[06:46:28] <vainoharhainen> ah now
[06:47:11] <VictorCL> hi
[06:47:12] <VictorCL> how can I set the cursor:hand to all click events of jquery automatically?
[06:48:05] <ShawnRisk> purefusion_: I am unsure at the moment, depends on what browser and computer they are using.  I woudl say use google search to figure out as there are a lot of help there.
[06:49:13] <vainoharhainen> xec: so, my code is quite messy bc i got alot of php but i stripped it down quite hard.
[06:49:23] <vainoharhainen> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/m2MwK/
[06:49:50] <xec> i read "something something stripped something quite hard"
[06:50:14] <vainoharhainen> ^^
[06:50:15] <seutje> VictorCL: that really belongs in CSS, but I'm sure u can come up with a highly unperformant line of JS to patch it up a bit
[06:50:17] <xec> oh god, did I destroy the internet
[06:50:26] <vainoharhainen> xec: =).
[06:50:44] <vainoharhainen> xec: as you se its just trigger the first one (inserted with html).
[06:51:23] <xec> vainoharhainen: i'm sorry, but I don't see.. what triggers what where?
[06:51:30] <vainoharhainen> the validator.
[06:51:35] <xec> what about it
[06:51:42] <vainoharhainen> Not wokring on new "numbers"
[06:51:46] <vainoharhainen> if you press on +
[06:51:47] <seutje> VictorCL: like $('*').each(function() { var $this=$(this),events=$this.data('events'); if (events && events['click']) { $this.css('cursor', 'pointer'); } }); but I wouldn't advise using that
[06:52:04] <VictorCL> yeah that seems slow
[06:52:21] <seutje> well yea, it goes over *all* elements
[06:52:47] <xec> vainoharhainen: i click on the + button and I get a new row
[06:53:11] <vainoharhainen> xec: yes, i want to validate all new rows with jquery.validator plugin.

[06:56:13] <xec> vainoharhainen: this is really messy, i can't make sense of most of the code, but inspecting the generated html shows differences
[06:56:29] <ShawnRisk> VictorCL: http://superdit.com/2011/04/23/jquery-detect-mouse-click-event/
[06:57:05] <xec> vainoharhainen: for instance, on the first row you have a .required class and a label with .error class - which are non-existant on the new/generated rows
[06:57:33] <ShawnRisk> imajes: isn't working?
[06:57:42] <imajes> no

[07:41:21] <LordThumper> Is there any way to fire an event after the 'fade' close animation finishes?
[07:41:53] <LordThumper> Sorry I mean, call a function after the 'fade' animation finishes
[07:44:33] <jcrawford> LordThumper: how are you doing the fade animation? are you using animate()?
[07:44:46] <jcrawford> if so there is a callback function which you can provide and will be called when the animation is finished
[07:45:21] <jcrawford> if you are using fadeToggle, it also allows for a callback function
[07:45:45] <jcrawford> hah my bad just noticed you are using UI :D

[07:59:28] <oxi> hi
[07:59:53] <xec> tomasm-:  you already get a jquery collection as "this" so you don't have to wrap it, but yes, you need to loop yourself
[08:00:07] <tomasm-> xec, thnks
[08:00:20] <jcrawford> thanks Zogot going to read up on find() now
[08:00:57] <oxi> How do I select all tags containing tags x AND y?
[08:01:09] <xec> tomasm-: i.e. this.each(...) will suffice
[08:01:15] <tomasm-> k
[08:02:43] <oxi> $("*>x","*>y") will select all tags containing x OR y, ... but I'm looking for x AND y
[08:03:03] <ajpiano> oxi: $(".x.y")
[08:03:33] <_ramo> hi
[08:03:55] <ajpiano> in the same way that $("div.foo") is all elements that are divs AND have the class foo, any other combination of selectors together like that means "AND"
[08:04:26] <tomasm-> can I use wrap() with a complex element, such as an entire table that has several rows/cols already, with a specific location for the other content?
[08:04:33] <_ramo> how is that effect called, when loading new feeddata into a feed dynamically when clicking a "load more" button or hover over an area?
[08:04:54] <oxi> ajpiano: that's for classes
[08:05:13] <ajpiano> oxi: any combination will work
[08:05:24] <xec> oxi: there are no elements named both <x> and <y>, what are you trying to do
[08:05:28] <ajpiano> $("[name='foo'][data-bar='baz']")
[08:05:38] <ajpiano> is all elements who are named foo and have data-bar == baz
[08:05:38] <ssj> _ramo ajax load?
[08:05:48] <RLa> *containing*
[08:06:13] <RLa> i think that is impossible to do with pure css selectors
[08:06:31] <jaiganesh> hi i want to write a jquery which will inspect a html page and will show the css and javascripts in it
[08:06:59] <ajpiano> $("foo:has(.x.y)") ?
[08:07:24] <RLa> ajpiano, tags, not classes
[08:07:45] <_ramo> ssj: hm, but how to get this "hover over an area an fire ajax" effect?
[08:07:51] <ajpiano> that barely even makes sense, things don't have more than one tagname
[08:07:58] <ssj> _ramo html event
[08:08:01] <Moshe> I would like to change the containment for a jQuery UI draggable while dragging, does someone know a way to do this?
[08:08:02] <ssj> onhover=
[08:08:09] <_ramo> what do i need, the date of the last post shown? am i saving this into a hidden field?
[08:08:34] <ssj> not pretty sure about that
[08:08:38] <ssj> havent used it  actually
[08:08:46] <ssj> the load more that is
[08:08:54] <RLa> ajpiano, <div><a ..> <br /></div> <- div has both tags a and br
[08:09:22] <RLa> oxi, is that something like what you need?
[08:09:45] <ajpiano> $("div:has(a):has(b)")
[08:10:06] <oxi> ajpiano: exactly!
[08:10:15] <_ramo> ssj: i didn't understand any word you wrote :D
[08:10:24] <oxi> ajpiano: but I think that doesn't work in jQuery
[08:10:24] <ssj> wtf :D
[08:10:54] <oxi> ajpiano: or maybe I did something wrong trying :has( ... ):has( ... )
[08:10:55] <ajpiano> oxi:what makes you think that
[08:11:06] <oxi> ajpiano: I'll try again
[08:11:25] <_ramo> ssj: i'm asking, what kind of data do i need to transmit to get the newest feeds
[08:11:46] <oxi> ajpiano: another thing, ... nesting also didn't work for me, but I'll also try that again: :has( .. :has( ... ) )
[08:11:47] <ssj> is it like the facebook thing ?
[08:11:49] <RLa> if anything else fails you can always use filter and check subdom to contain those tags yourself
[08:11:53] <ssj> show older posts _ramo?
[08:12:18] <ajpiano> oxi: doing it all in one selector really is gross, imo,
[08:12:21] <_ramo> ssj: yeah exactly
[08:12:32] <_ramo> or get current ones to the top
[08:12:53] <xec> oxi: i have a sneaking suspicion you might be approaching this in a overcomplicated way - do you have a sample html we could look at?
[08:13:02] <xec> oxi: and a context
[08:13:33] <MarcelT3> http://jsfiddle.net/FAAcZ/2/ need to enable the user to hide the content below the toggles again. can u give me a hint?
[08:14:12] <oxi> ajpiano: now :has():has() worked fine, I think I did something wrong before
[08:14:18] <ssj> no idea _ramo
[08:14:20] <oxi> ajpiano: thanks a lot!
[08:14:26] <ajpiano> woo
[08:14:36] <ssj> but u probably need to do a timecheck on em
[08:14:48] <Blaster> anyone know of a way to hide every element inside of an element?
[08:15:00] <JAAulde> JS Community--this shall not stand! A Celebrity pulled ahead of TeamJS.  Fix This! http://www.crowdrise.com/celebrity-fundraisers/special/firefoxchallengeevent
[08:15:23] <tomasm-> Blaster, $('foo *').hide(); ?
[08:15:24] <_ramo> ssj: something like an activity feed
[08:15:31] <tomasm-> rather, $('foo > *').hide()
[08:15:47] <tomasm-> Blaster, why not just hide the element itself?
[08:15:49] <Blaster> what about $('#something').children().hide();?
[08:16:05] <xec> MarcelT3: on click you are doing a .slideUp() followed by a .slideToggle()
[08:16:12] <tomasm-> Blaster, what use is the element if everything inside of it is hidden?
[08:16:18] <jaiganesh> hi i want to write jquery which will inspect a html page and will show the css and javascripts in it
[08:16:47] <ajpiano> jaiganesh: do it.
[08:16:53] <ajpiano> no one is stopping you.
[08:17:00] <MarcelT3> xec yup, uncool, i know. i hoped to select all h2 _without_ .showing -- is there a way to do that?
[08:17:05] <tomasm-> (only himself)
[08:17:30] <jaiganesh> ajpiano please help me out how to that any hints please
[08:17:41] <jaiganesh> @ajpiano
[08:17:59] <tomasm-> MarcelT3, instead of h2.showing, i think you can do something like h2[class!~showing], though I could be wrong
[08:18:08] <Blaster> tomasm: because when you re open the element certain ones are shown again
[08:18:08] <ajpiano> jaiganesh: this channel is for helping people with specific problems they are having, not brainstorming entire concepts with strangers.
[08:18:26] <MarcelT3> tomasm i´ll check that thx.
[08:18:29] <Blaster> it's a game and only certain elements are to be shown at certain times, but when they click close, it hides everything so when they click start again it can show them all again
[08:19:15] <jaiganesh> @ajpiano please help me out  sorry for disturbing
[08:19:24] <jaiganesh> i need some hints only
[08:19:30] <ajpiano> jaiganesh: i have no such plans, sorry.
[08:21:26] <tomasm-> jaiganesh, problem is that css and js are often in external files, something jquery cant print out... only <script> and <style> tags can be searched for, ie $('script, style').text()
[08:23:26] <gho5t> I'm trying to figure out how to decide when something should be a plugin instead of a widget?
[08:23:43] <ajpiano> gho5t: plugins are stateless
[08:24:26] <ajpiano> once you have state that you need to manage, you probably will want a widget or some other means of associating an object with a dom element
[08:26:03] <gho5t> ajpiano: yeah that's the reason I keep hearing but I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out if something should have state
[08:26:14] <gho5t> how do you make that decision?
[08:26:25] <ajpiano> gho5t: it's not a decision that you make, it's a fact of the implementation
[08:26:45] <ajpiano> for instance, if it's something that you can "turn off" after you "turn it on" then that means there's state
[08:26:45] <gho5t> right. I worded that wrong
[08:26:55] <gho5t> ok
[08:27:11] <gho5t> a guy on my team made a checkbox plugin that can set the checkbox to selected
[08:27:17] <RLa> but that state might not always be contained in the script
[08:27:20] <gho5t> it seems to be working fine as a plugin
[08:27:28] <gho5t> he's just checking for a class
[08:27:33] <RLa> yes, checkbox holds its state itself
[08:27:37] <gho5t> is this something that should have been done as a widget?
[08:27:48] <ajpiano> not necessarily....
[08:28:06] <ajpiano> some things you can kludge without a full on proper widget
[08:28:22] <gho5t> via class names and data attributes, right?
[08:28:30] <gho5t> or element attributes such as selected
[08:28:32] <ajpiano> but it gets grosser and grosser to track state if there is no object with methods, etc.
[08:28:35] <ajpiano> yep.
[08:29:06] <MarcelT3> is jsfiddle under siege? i get timeouts and stuff..
[08:29:07] <gho5t> so a plugin is good if you just want to turn somethign on and don't care to know if it's been turned on later
[08:29:13] <gho5t> for example
[08:29:28] <gho5t> or if you plan on checking state by kludging
[08:29:49] <ajpiano> that's not to say the thing also couldnt' be implemented as a widget as well
[08:30:32] <gho5t> so why not use a widget every time
[08:30:39] <xh> could someone please help figure out what is wrong with this code: https://gist.github.com/1485772 - it is a frames version of a browser bookmarklet that enables text selection and context menu on pages that block it; the original no-frames version is here: http://alanhogan.com/code/text-selection-bookmarklet
[08:31:19] <ajpiano> gho5t: because plugins were around first, people found them easier to write
[08:31:33] <Papillon> jQuery documentation seems to be missing on jQuery.com is it just me?
[08:31:44] <gho5t> ajpiano: ok, but going forwrard do most people just write widgets?
[08:31:46] <ajpiano> gho5t: understand that a jquery ui "widget" is just a wrapper for "instantiating and asssociating an object instance with a dom element(s)"
[08:31:48] <gho5t> Papillon: api.jquery.com
[08:32:32] <gho5t> ajpiano: would you write a radiobutton as a widget?
[08:32:38] <ajpiano> yes
[08:32:56] <MarcelT3> http://jsfiddle.net/FAAcZ/4/ tried out the different NOT having selectors but no luck, how could i select h2 only if it has not the class .showing ?
[08:33:12] <clockwize> how would I replace a node inside it's parent with another node?
[08:33:21] <Papillon> gho5t: Ah, thanks - just the main link that's wrong -  linking to docs.jquery.com
[08:33:36] <ajpiano> MarcelT3: you are making a one-time selection with those things, the click handlers don't dynamically change just because the classes are changing
[08:34:01] <ajpiano> MarcelT3: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide25
[08:34:56] <ajpiano> MarcelT3: imagine if you poisoned everyone wearing a blue hat, and then gave everyone with a green hat a delcious turkey dinner.  then one person who had a blue hat on changes to a green hat.... he's still poisoned.
[08:35:04] <jcrawford> MarcelT3: try hasClass :D
[08:35:10] <ajpiano> he doesn't automatically have a turkey dinner.
[08:35:24] <jcrawford> lol ajpiano nice analogy :D
[08:35:34] <MarcelT3> ajpiano i´m far from poisioning people *lol
[08:36:49] <ajpiano> MarcelT3: something like this will likely work better http://jsfiddle.net/FAAcZ/4/
[08:36:53] <ajpiano> meh http://jsfiddle.net/FAAcZ/5/
[08:37:50] <MarcelT3> wow. big thanks!
[08:38:10] <ajpiano> it's important that you understand the concept in the slide i linked you too though
[08:38:12] <ajpiano> to*
[08:40:19] <MarcelT3> yes although the slide is abit short on that ;) only by using a var we start live behaviour? (in the script u fixed for me)
[08:40:54] <ajpiano> no, that has nothing to do with it
[08:41:08] <ajpiano> MarcelT3: read the slide before it too
[08:41:17] <ajpiano> i just did that because i didn't want to do $("#content") twice
[08:41:36] <MarcelT3> okay
[08:41:36] <meesebyte> Do I have permission to pretend IE doesn't exist?
[08:42:09] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Generally no
[08:42:52] <meesebyte> sudo pretend IE doesn't exist.
[08:43:41] <meesebyte> eviltwin, are you able to test IE atm?
[08:43:58] <davetarmac> hey guys - $(document).ready(function() { â€¦ } runs the jquery when the document has finished loading, right?
[08:44:08] <Blaster> how come jquery animations are so much smoother on firefox than on IE?
[08:44:21] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Nope
[08:45:06] <meesebyte> eviltwin: I'm not sure it has too much to do with the jquery, but since I've tricked out my site with jquery this (http://meesebyte.com/portfolio.html) works everywhere beautifully but widths and stuff are screwy in IE
[08:45:08] <davetarmac> I'm trying to use jquery cycle and I've got it in the $(document).ready but it is still setting a height before the image is loading in
[08:45:41] <ajpiano> meesebyte: you should consider having a doctype and an html tag in your document
[08:45:43] <ajpiano> IE likes that.
[08:46:05] <meesebyte> do I not? 0_o lemme check
[08:46:19] <meesebyte> ah, k yeah
[08:46:32] <davetarmac> nevermind - fixed it
[08:46:50] <davetarmac> gave the image a height and we're sorted
[08:46:54] <Hackwar> hi folks, I need to read/set a cookie in my code, but since jquery apparently does not have a native cookie function, I wanted to use the cookie plugin. The plugin archive however is broken/down/whatever. I can't download from there. What to do?
[08:47:20] <pifantastic> Hackwar: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[08:47:29] <Hackwar> THANK YOU!!!
[08:47:30] <Hackwar> :-)
[08:47:39] <ssj> hey is there a limit on the size of data we can post with ajax?
[08:47:43] <meesebyte> ajpianoâ€¦ Thatâ€¦.. fixed it....
[08:47:50] <pifantastic> ssj: Your server may have a limit set
[08:47:58] <pifantastic> ssj: PHP defaults to 2MB
[08:48:01] <meesebyte> Thank you...
[08:48:12] <ssj> how can i change it pifantastic?
[08:48:13] * meesebyte facepalms
[08:48:29] <dougb> I'm having an issue where I post a form that has data from a CKEditor box in a Twitter Bootstrap Modal and it isn't posting the data, but hitting the back button and submitting the data again sends it.  This is the code within the form: http://pastebin.com/t24AawYi
[08:48:54] <pifantastic> ssj: http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php search for "post_max_size"
[08:48:59] <dougb> And this is the post data: http://learn.db-dev.info/tools/postviewer/u/EXioFnzsxshUXvsZ the second post is on the top, you can see it passed "body"
[08:49:02] <pifantastic> ssj: I was wrong, default is 8M
[08:49:20] <LordThumper> dougb: Wrong pastebin url
[08:49:36] <M4d3L1> hi. I have this var http://paste2.org/p/1831903  and I want to access specific id. how I do it?
[08:50:27] <Eviltwin> M4d3L1: Specific ID? I don't see any IDs
[08:50:28] <pifantastic> M4d3L1: _deakers[10647]
[08:50:37] <dougb> LordThumper: sorry, http://pastebin.com/CXrxV30s
[08:50:45] <Eviltwin> Oh one of those items?
[08:50:54] <Eviltwin> Yeah, _dealers[10647] etc
[08:51:13] <M4d3L1> I have try alert(_dealers[clientId]); but it say undefined. and I can see it in the var
[08:51:37] <ssj> thnx pifantastic :)
[08:51:40] <ssj> will look into it
[08:51:43] <pifantastic> M4d3L1: are you sure clientId is defined?
[08:52:09] <Eviltwin> M4d3L1: see ?alert
[08:52:09] <bot-t> M4d3L1, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[08:52:45] <LordThumper> dougb: I am no javascript expert but, try removing "return false;" from the onclick
[08:53:06] <LordThumper> I think that stops the form from submitting
[08:53:52] <jepster> hi, I want to clone an element. with $('#my-element').clone().insertAfter("#my-element"); â€” but I get only the message "TypeError: undefined is not a function".
[08:53:58] <LordThumper> Try recreating your issue in jsfiddle
[08:55:10] <pifantastic> jsfiddle actually seems to be broken today...
[08:55:13] <dougb> LordThumper: nope, that is the modal window.  it's basically telling the modal window to close and then send the text data to a preview div on the page
[08:55:19] <pifantastic> anyone else having trouble getting it to execute code?
[08:55:57] <meesebyte> pifantastic: super slow? was that way yesterday
[08:57:28] <ajpiano> meesebyte: yeah, IE kicks into quirksmode without a doctype and a properly formed document so your widths and everything would be screwy, glad to help :)
[08:57:35] <jepster> LordThumper: ok, it works in jsfiddle. amazing tool. thanks.
[08:58:16] <meesebyte> ajpiano: what's funny is that I've clearly never realized it matters that much, which is probably why I've had so many problems in the past supporting IE
[08:58:29] <LordThumper> yw
[08:58:38] <ajpiano> heh
[08:59:15] <meesebyte> K, time to add IE 6 support </jest>
[08:59:47] <LordThumper> meesebyte: You don't need to
[09:00:08] <LordThumper> IE6 users will get IE8 through automatic updates soon
[09:00:29] <meesebyte> Do html tags not show up in your IRC or something?
[09:00:42] <LordThumper> lol?
[09:00:45] <Eviltwin> meesebyte: Only the closing ones
[09:00:46] <LordThumper> markup tags?
[09:00:48] <pifantastic> LordThumper: that is a tad..optimistic
[09:00:56] <meesebyte> I said "</jest>" afterwards
[09:01:00] <LordThumper> <test> </test>
[09:01:00] <Eviltwin> pifantastic: Agreed
[09:01:06] <LordThumper> Yeah i saw the </jest>
[09:01:17] <LordThumper> using mIRC
[09:01:17] <meesebyte> next time Ill do (jk)
[09:01:30] <meesebyte> I'm using Adium <3
[09:01:36] <LordThumper> Why is that optimistic?
[09:01:57] <LordThumper> Kinda realistic when updates are forced
[09:02:13] <pifantastic> LordThumper: they are opt-out, not forced
[09:02:27] <pifantastic> which means large swaths of evil IT men could opt out
[09:02:36] <pifantastic> for entire companies
[09:02:42] <LordThumper> Well fair enough, but I am sure that 10% of IE6 users will be reduced
[09:02:50] <pifantastic> LordThumper: you just made that number up
[09:02:57] <LordThumper> no I didn't
[09:03:01] <pifantastic> PROVE IT
[09:03:03] <meesebyte> :/ MSFT should totally just explode IE6 forever. Has someone not made a virus that has the sole goal up updating IE?
[09:03:04] <LordThumper> Ok
[09:03:17] <meesebyte> up->of
[09:06:20] <sphinxxx> who the hell supports ie6 still, lol
[09:06:27] <LordThumper> Ok IE6 share is actually 1.2%
[09:06:43] <LordThumper> And any sane IT department would upgrade :)
[09:07:13] <sphinxxx> and out of that 1.2%, mostly grandmas and windows 98 desktops
[09:07:58] <LordThumper> Total of IE6 and 7 is less than 5%
[09:08:14] <sphinxxx> i dont think its bad not to support ie7 either
[09:08:42] <LordThumper> Yeah well the IE8 upgarde will be avaiable to that 5%
[09:08:46] <LordThumper> upgrade*
[09:08:52] <LordThumper> frozen fingers :/
[09:08:55] <Blaster> Hey.. I have a bug that occours hiding an element on a remote server, but it works fine on my local server.... exact same code.
[09:09:10] <LordThumper> Blaster: Same browser?
[09:09:11] <sphinxxx> only way to progress is for developers to just stop supporting it, would speed things up tremendously
[09:09:14] <Blaster> LordThumper: yes
[09:09:18] <Blaster> just IE 7 though
[09:09:23] <Blaster> thats only where the bug happens
[09:09:32] <meesebyte> lordthumper: I'm sure the number of computers in corporations still with IE 6 would be disturbing. We update our company's browsers fairly frequently. Nobody is below IE8 (as far as I know)
[09:09:34] <LordThumper> Try forcing the .js reload
[09:09:46] <LordThumper> Ctrl+R
[09:09:50] <krz> why does new Date(1324339200000).toUTCString() return "Tue, 20 Dec 2011 00:00:00 GMT". shouldn't it be UTC?
[09:09:53] <Blaster> I reloaded several times
[09:09:56] <krz> instead of GMT?
[09:10:13] <LordThumper> Blaster: Try emptying the cache
[09:10:18] <Blaster> Tried that too....
[09:10:23] <Blaster> i'm stumped... but it's the exact same code
[09:10:29] <Blaster> works on local server, not on remote server
[09:10:36] <Blaster> has some ajax calls
[09:10:55] <LordThumper> Well if it's the same browser version I am kinda confused
[09:11:37] <Blaster> should it work exactly the same no matter if it's local or remote?
[09:11:47] <Blaster> if on the same IE version
[09:11:53] <LordThumper> meesebyte: Yeah I understand that. Well you need to take into consideration the target audience of your site.
[09:12:26] <LordThumper> Yes it should
[09:12:48] <meesebyte> lordthumper: I consider everyone the target, but mainly just there for info and to show off
[09:12:55] <meesebyte> so as much support as I can do it great
[09:13:20] <LordThumper> Blaster: You are using a jQuery hide() ?
[09:14:29] <LordThumper> Are you sure the jQuery library is loading from the remote server?
[09:14:30] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/pF3km/2/ : shouldn't the new <select> be set to "Mary"?  Or I guess .clone() just takes the ORIGINAL dom element, value and all?
[09:16:13] <LordThumper> Go to View Source, copy paste the jQuery resource URL and see if it loads correctly
[09:32:10] <quizme> anybody know any good customizable graph visualization libraries in javascript/jquery ?
[09:37:48] <pifantastic> quizme: graphael, jqplot, protovis, d3
[09:37:58] <pifantastic> flot
[09:38:01] <pifantastic> so many!
[09:38:14] <vdclouis> hi, I have this loop that won't quite work http://jsfiddle.net/EtesW/
[09:39:00] <pifantastic> ?xy @ vdclouis
[09:39:01] <bot-t> vdclouis, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[09:40:21] <vdclouis> pifantastic: I just want to make the original code better, so I thought a loop would be a good idea. But it doesn't do the same thing as the original code. I can't figure out what though ...
[09:40:55] <vdclouis> so the original code works, and the loop doesn't
[09:41:09] <pifantastic> vdclouis: can you also give us the HTML?
[09:41:25] <vdclouis> sure, but it's ugly :p
[09:42:20] <vdclouis> with html http://jsfiddle.net/EtesW/1/
[09:42:31] <vdclouis> obviously without img's
[09:42:44] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/pF3km/2/ : shouldn't the new <select> be set to "Mary"?  Or I guess .clone() just takes the ORIGINAL dom element, value and all?
[09:43:16] <krz> i need: "new Date(1324339200000).toUTCString()" to output Dec 20
[09:43:19] <krz> anyone know how?
[09:43:42] <pifantastic> ?g mdn Date @ krz
[09:43:43] <bot-t> krz, Date - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[09:48:18] <sphinxxx> whats a good plugin for code highlighting?
[09:48:20] <pifantastic> krz: It's a scoping issue
[09:48:21] <sphinxxx> javascript and also css
[09:48:40] <pifantastic> krz: your click handler runs after the for loop completes
[09:49:00] <pifantastic> krz: so what do you think the value of a will be *every* time that click handler runs?
[09:50:26] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: there is chili, but it is kinda hard to use: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-chili-js/
[09:50:49] <pifantastic> and syntaxhighlighter: http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/
[09:51:34] <sphinxxx> thanks pifantastic
[09:51:41] <sphinxxx> and you put code within what tags?
[09:51:46] <sphinxxx> <pre> or <code>
[09:52:02] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: I think it's configurable with syntaxhighlighter
[09:54:23] <Gent> So this question is not explicitly jQuery related, but I'm hoping you'll all forgive me and help me to answer it.  So it is obviously possible to create an element without appending it.  I also know it's possible to create an element, add event handlers, and then append it, which means a non-appended element can have events.  So here's the main question, is it possible to trigger those events on a non-appended element.  In particular is it possible to dynamica
[09:56:39] <Narcissus> So I have a div with class="current". The div has an id. How can I find the id by selecting by class?
[09:58:52] <pifantastic> Narcissus: $('.current').filter('#foo');
[09:59:00] <pifantastic> don't know why you would need to do that though
[09:59:12] <Gent> pifantastic: I think he means read the ID
[09:59:18] <pifantastic> oh
[09:59:27] <pifantastic> $('.current').attr('id');
[09:59:32] <Gent> like $('.current')[0].id
[10:00:14] <pifantastic> Gent: your question got cut off
[10:00:19] <pifantastic> but I wold say
[10:00:21] <pifantastic> ?tias
[10:00:21] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:00:50] <Gent> pifantastic: I basically want to know if it's possible to dynamically create a form, and iframe, having the form post the iframe, without ever appending either to the DOM.
[10:00:53] <Gent> I.e., just creaitng them
[10:01:16] <Gent> I know it's possible to set event handlers on created nodes before appending them, so I was hoping it was possible to fully bootstrap them and trigger them
[10:01:44] <kavelot> $('#img-list ul li') return all "li"s objects as an array... is it possible to get their attr('name') on an array instead?
[10:01:46] <Gent> Searching google provides some note of silent "failure" with regards to submit() -- but once looking at the page I can't find the words
[10:01:49] <Gent> and there's no cached version
[10:02:18] <Gent> ".submit() will (silently) fail if the the form has not been inserted into the DOM: ..."
[10:02:26] <pifantastic> kavelot: $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#img-list ul li').map(function() { return this.name; });
[10:02:31] <Gent> that's the most I can read from the cached description on Google
[10:02:35] <pifantastic> damn you colloquy
[10:02:50] <kavelot> pifantastic: smart, thanks
[10:03:03] <sphinxxx> piftantastic, syntaxhighlighter is working great,  but it seems a bit bloated
[10:03:10] <pifantastic> Gent: so that implies no. I doubt you can submit a form that has not been added to the DOM, but I honestly wouldnt know without trying
[10:03:11] <sphinxxx> had to include like 5 scripts :(
[10:03:26] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: don't say it's bloated until you actual notice a performance problem
[10:03:35] <Gent> pifantastic: The wording reads as though it's a problem with the submit() implementation though
[10:03:42] <pifantastic> It has several scripts specifically to make it unbloated
[10:03:44] <Gent> not necessarily a restriction of teh DOM or a particular browser
[10:03:47] <pifantastic> so you only include the ones you need
[10:03:53] <Gent> and now that I can't find it on the page... that leads me to believe it more so
[10:03:58] <Gent> i.e., maybe it has been *fixed*
[10:04:09] <Gent> technically creating an element DOES put it in the DOM....
[10:04:17] <pifantastic> Gent: it sounds like a security problem to me
[10:04:26] <sphinxxx> the other thing is, i can't figure out how to set the width
[10:04:31] <Gent> pifantastic: no more than having it 100% hidden before it's even appended
[10:04:32] <sphinxxx> its always doing 100% width
[10:05:08] <Gent> anyway, got a meeting
[10:05:10] <Gent> be back later
[10:06:05] <kavelot> is that too ugly? return this.name.replace(/^img_/, '')*1
[10:09:20] <Pritchard> Hi.  I have questions about the validator plugin.  My form is validating whenever a key is pressed.  I want it to validate only when the user tabs off of a form field.
[10:10:02] <Pritchard> Is there an option I should change in my validation initialization?
[10:10:40] <LordThumper> Form field?
[10:10:42] <LordThumper> Textbox?
[10:11:17] <LordThumper> Something like $('#textbox').blur(function (event) { //code });
[10:11:17] <Pritchard> LordThumper:  Yes.
[10:11:56] <Pritchard> Hm... I don't see any *.blur specified in the javascript file.
[10:12:06] <Pritchard> Or any onchange events.
[10:12:13] <Pritchard> I wonder why the form is validating whenever a key is pressed.
[10:12:17] <LordThumper> blur is when textbox loses focus
[10:12:44] <Pritchard> LordThumper:  Yes, but the form is validating whenever text is changed or a key is pressed.
[10:12:54] <kavelot> pifantastic: this map() you suggested seems to return an "object", not an array (I can't .join() it)... any hints?
[10:12:57] <LordThumper> Yeah copy your code in jsfiddle or pastebin
[10:13:38] <Pritchard> LordThumper:  Thanks.  Unfortunately, this is for work and the code is a mess.
[10:13:49] * Pritchard it isn't his code.
[10:15:52] <Pritchard> LordThumper:  Seems like I could set onkeyup: false and that would cause it only to validate onblur.
[10:15:59] <Pritchard> And on submit.
[10:16:20] <Eviltwin> kavelot: .get() on the end
[10:16:56] <LordThumper> 1) Javascript code is visible to anyone on the internet, it is not like you are disclosing any server-side code
[10:16:59] <kavelot> it's dirty, but it worked: $('#img-list ul li input[name^=img_]').map(function() { return this.name.replace(/^img_/, '')*1; }).toArray().join(' ')
[10:17:17] <Eviltwin> kavelot: http://jsfiddle.net/Cmm6T/
[10:17:26] <LordThumper> 2) If you want help, atleast try to recreate some of the code in the jsfiddle, I don't read minds
[10:17:28] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/pF3km/2/ : shouldn't the new <select> be set to "Mary"?  Or I guess .clone() just takes the ORIGINAL dom element, value and all?
[10:17:31] <Pritchard> LordThumper:  1)  You're right when it's client-side JavaScript.  The code isn't pure JS though.
[10:17:37] <Pritchard> 2)  I appreciate that sincerely.
[10:17:59] <Pritchard> This code is spaghetti.  I've had so much trouble making even small changes.
[10:18:32] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: It would probably be Mary if you grabbed the .html() and set the .html() of the target
[10:19:03] <Eviltwin> Unless I'm misunderstanding
[10:19:22] <Eviltwin> Oh, it's not keeping the value change
[10:19:23] <NoiseEee> well i just figured the value has been changed and the cloned element would receive the new set value
[10:23:04] <NoiseEee> it seems like that behaviour is only happening with a <select>; compare to http://jsfiddle.net/pF3km/3/
[10:24:17] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/pF3km/4/ to see the orig values before cliking anywhere on the "holder" <div>
[10:24:20] <Eviltwin> Peculiar
[10:25:25] <Eviltwin> You can so .clone().val(sel.val()).
[10:25:33] <Eviltwin> But that's odd
[10:25:57] <NoiseEee> mmmhm
[10:42:13] <chrisinajar> Hi! I'm using the jquery ui draggable, but when I drag the corner around it also selects text on the page. Is there any way to stop that?
[10:43:23] <rroelofs> sure
[10:43:29] <rroelofs> :-)
[10:44:48] <rroelofs>     window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
[10:44:48] <Blaster> anyone wanna help me with a problem in exchange for $?
[10:44:58] <chrisinajar> that deselects
[10:45:10] <chrisinajar> while dragging it will still select things
[10:45:36] <chrisinajar> also, if they had selected something, then they drag, it will deselect what they had highlighted (along with flashing selection on most of the page while dragging)
[10:46:06] <chrisinajar> (that's what i'm doing right now, looking for a superior solution)
[10:47:33] <chrisinajar> rroelofs: ^
[10:47:41] <Eviltwin> Blaster: If by $ you mean jQuery, then no
[10:47:53] <chrisinajar> Blaster: no, but if you ask your question someone might help you anyway.
[10:48:37] <Blaster> im having a really frustrating problem with some code that works fine on my local server but not on my remote server
[10:48:46] <Blaster> the issue only occurs in IE 7
[10:48:57] <Eviltwin> Oh, then we're going to need $$$
[10:49:03] <chrisinajar> Blaster: that's cool and all, but you still haven't asked a question.
[10:49:46] <Blaster> How is it even possible for there to be a difference in code executed on a remote server vs. a local server?
[10:49:53] <Blaster> If using the same browser
[10:51:59] <ravenzz> Blaster demo!
[10:57:23] <hkon_> it is possible if it's not the same code..
[10:58:33] <Eviltwin> Blaster: So they're both http://
[10:58:40] <Blaster> yes
[10:59:11] <Blaster> i cant demonstrate though because the problem is a difference between my local server and my remote server
[10:59:34] <Blaster> maybe I can make a screencast?
[11:00:56] <Blaster> ahh thats too much work
[11:01:24] <Eviltwin> I want you to view source for both of them and make sure they're identical
[11:01:35] <Eviltwin> And try checking some of the files they link
[11:01:37] <inMotion> hola
[11:01:59] <Eviltwin> Browsers are notorious for caching even when the server and user insit they shouldn't
[11:03:03] <hkon_> yeah maybe something linked in is cached
[11:03:10] <hkon_> but not the actual file you are accessing
[11:03:17] <hkon_> a stylesheet or a js file or smoething
[11:03:18] <KWhat_Work> What is the widget function suppose to return ?
[11:03:34] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: The widget function?
[11:03:39] <Eviltwin> Like $.widget
[11:04:40] <KWhat_Work> well let me ask what i am trying to figure out
[11:04:51] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a good place to start
[11:05:18] <Blaster> I'm finding out that jQuery probably isnt the best language to make a game in
[11:05:31] <Eviltwin> Blaster: jQuery isn't a language
[11:05:37] <Eviltwin> And it totally depends on the game
[11:05:39] <KWhat_Work> I have a .widget extension that takes an element and hides it and then inserts some other css styled dom structure right after that element.  I am trying to get that dom structure by the original item I hid.
[11:06:15] <Eviltwin> Blaster: I made this in a jsFiddle using jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/99hrw/17/
[11:06:29] <KWhat_Work> arent there specific JS libraries for games Blaster
[11:07:08] <M4d3L1> how do I select item in a dropdown menu with jquery?
[11:07:34] <Rotham> hey.. im trying to understand jquery plugin design a bit better... can someone explain what this snippet from the date picker does:  http://pastebin.com/Zx4JzWPP
[11:07:38] <KWhat_Work> M4d3L1: use attr('selected', true)
[11:07:57] <Rotham> or does anyone have a reference explaining plugin design best practices?
[11:08:15] <KWhat_Work> Rotham: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[11:08:25] <Eviltwin> M4d3L1: $("select")?
[11:08:55] <M4d3L1> kwhat but it has no way to directly do myselect.val(â€¦) and get the good option selected?
[11:09:12] <Eviltwin> M4d3L1: myselect.val()
[11:09:22] <M4d3L1> I do. but option is not selected
[11:09:22] <Eviltwin> If myselect is a jQuery collection
[11:09:26] <Eviltwin> Like $("select")
[11:09:37] <Rotham> thank you KWhat_Work
[11:09:48] <M4d3L1> jQuery("#state").val(city[1].toUpperCase());
[11:09:49] <KWhat_Work> M4d3L1: you need to select the option that is selected
[11:09:52] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: When a widget is instantiated etc, it returns whatever collection it had
[11:10:05] <Eviltwin> To maintain chainability
[11:10:17] <Eviltwin> Inside the element this.element refers to the original element
[11:10:19] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: yah, i need to go the other way
[11:10:22] <Eviltwin> Inside the widget*
[11:10:39] <Eviltwin> Now you can also do this.myshit = $("<div>"); or whatever
[11:10:44] <Eviltwin> And refer to that
[11:10:53] <KWhat_Work> i have this.element, i need to get some property thats part of that widget.... I guess i need a selector
[11:10:55] <Eviltwin> Maybe if I can see some more of your code I can help you figure it out
[11:11:43] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: its alot of code but its at http://jquery-ux-forms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/datebox.html
[11:11:45] <M4d3L1> how do I select the good option to select. it was a better question I think. when I only know the id of the select box and the value to set?
[11:12:12] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: you can store more things on the widget instance
[11:12:18] <KWhat_Work> M4d3L1: what exactly are you trying to select or get, your English is bad so maybe an example ?
[11:12:19] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: So can you explain what this issue is with referring to one by the other
[11:12:19] <ajpiano> like this.menu = this.element.find(".menu")
[11:12:43] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: I suspect you're not understanding / taking advantage of closure within the widget
[11:12:53] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: so for that example i would like todo $('#date_box').datebox('ux_element')
[11:12:56] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Doesn't work in IE
[11:13:02] <Eviltwin> Blaster: What doesn't
[11:13:05] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: then you could add a method that returns the reference
[11:13:07] <Blaster> http://jsfiddle.net/99hrw/17/
[11:13:16] <Eviltwin> It's canvas
[11:13:17] <Eviltwin> Fuck IE
[11:13:34] <Blaster> Well, since half the internet uses it we have to keep them in mind...
[11:13:37] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: just add uxElement: function() { return this.ux_exlement; } to your widget prototype
[11:14:06] <KWhat_Work> yah thats what i was thinking ajpiano, just wanted to make sure i didnt miss a more elegant solution or something
[11:14:42] <ajpiano> seems good to me
[11:14:48] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Its suported by > IE8
[11:15:06] <Eviltwin> And there are plugins available for earlier versions
[11:15:17] <Blaster> It looks cool
[11:15:26] <Eviltwin> There's no excuse for not using at least a recent version of a browser even if it is IE
[11:15:42] <Blaster> The company i'm building this software for uses IE 7
[11:15:45] <Eviltwin> I'll still hurt you if you use IE, just not as much
[11:16:02] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to do a slide motion (showing an item) to the left? ie a div that is right justified on the page opens inward.
[11:16:05] <Eviltwin> My example wasn't what you should do for your game in IE7
[11:16:20] <Eviltwin> It was just an example to show how little code is required to do some pretty neat stuff in a good browser
[11:16:32] <KWhat_Work> M4d3L1: did you figure it out?  I am still unclear on what it is you are trying to do.
[11:16:38] <Eviltwin> <= IE8 supports everything that's happening there except the actual drawing of it
[11:16:59] <BigVent> Hello all.  I've just started working with jQuery & need a nudge in the right direction.  http://jsfiddle.net/4Dbgt/2/
[11:16:59] <BigVent> When someone presses "Submit" I see all the content in the address bar... which is fine.  What's the best way to include all of this in an email automagicly?
[11:17:37] <Blaster> Well what do you do when you're building a game for someone and they demo it on IE 7?
[11:17:41] <Eviltwin> BigVent: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/271171/sending-emails-with-javascript
[11:17:54] <Eviltwin> Blaster: What kind of game is it
[11:17:54] <ajpiano> Blaster: people don't demo cutting edge browser games on ie7
[11:17:58] <Eviltwin> Does it use <canvas>?
[11:18:00] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Exactly
[11:18:13] <BigVent> Thanks Eviltwin!  I'll look into that.
[11:18:38] <Blaster> Eviltwin: No but maybe it should
[11:18:42] <Blaster> it uses divs
[11:18:49] <Eviltwin> Not if you want to support IE7.....
[11:19:09] <Blaster> its a quiz
[11:19:16] <Blaster> in chinese
[11:19:26] <ajpiano> Blaster: is this the game where you are refreshing the page state every second in a setInterval loop?
[11:19:29] <Eviltwin> There shouldn't be any need for <canvas> for a quiz
[11:19:44] <Blaster> this is the quiz http://redstarmedia.ca/eec
[11:19:54] <Blaster> the fourth "note" button is to start the quiz
[11:20:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, I remember helping you write this AJAX
[11:20:54] <Blaster> hideAll() is where the problem is
[11:21:08] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Look into the , operator
[11:21:10] <Blaster> because on IE 7 it doesnt hide properly
[11:21:12] <Eviltwin> In CSS selectors
[11:21:22] <Blaster> like css('display','none') ?
[11:21:26] <Eviltwin> No
[11:21:42] <Eviltwin> Like $('.quizWrapper, .tipWrapper, .overlay')
[11:21:49] <M4d3L1> ok nvm! it has a space in my value. it why it was not working lol
[11:22:04] <Blaster> Eviltwin: oh ok, just to condense my code?
[11:22:12] <Blaster> or will it help ie 7?
[11:22:12] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[11:22:20] <Eviltwin> So what's not working in IE7?
[11:22:22] <Eviltwin> Precisely
[11:22:22] <Blaster> go ahead and refresh the page
[11:22:29] <Blaster> because i had to revert some code i messed up
[11:23:00] <Eviltwin> Also with phonetic_number
[11:23:00] <Blaster> ok so when you click the 4th note and it opens the quiz, then you click the button on the left, it goes to the first question
[11:23:04] <Blaster> and the timer starts counting down...
[11:23:07] <Eviltwin> If you're returning, there's kind of an implied break
[11:23:11] <KWhat_Work> anyone know if there is an eta for http://plugins.jquery.com/
[11:23:15] <Eviltwin> You can only return once
[11:23:29] <Blaster> Eviltwin: which line?
[11:23:42] <Eviltwin> 322-329 of eec.js
[11:23:58] <Blaster> ohh ok
[11:24:05] <Blaster> that functions almost not used
[11:24:10] <Eviltwin> K
[11:24:14] <Eviltwin> Just thought I'd point it out
[11:24:23] <Eviltwin> So what am I supposed to be clicking?
[11:24:32] <Blaster> basically when you close the quiz while the timer is counting down
[11:24:34] <Blaster> and then re open the quiz
[11:24:43] <Blaster> some text doesn't dissapear, but this only happens on IE 7
[11:25:04] <Blaster> and it only happens on redstarmedia.ca, not localhost
[11:25:22] <Distilled> Are the API docs down on jquery.com?
[11:25:31] <Blaster> I tested with IE 8 compatibility mode because I think that is the same rendering as IE7 right?
[11:25:35] <Eviltwin> Distilled: http://api.jquery.com/
[11:25:46] <Distilled> The pages are blank for me
[11:26:02] <Eviltwin> Not here
[11:26:06] <Distilled> I can browse categories, but there are no links.
[11:26:11] <Distilled> Ok. :-(
[11:26:29] <Eviltwin> Blaster: I believe that's how they worked it
[11:26:32] <Blaster> Eviltwin: were you able to duplicate the bug?
[11:26:48] <Blaster> the 4th big yellow note is what starts the quiz
[11:26:52] <ajpiano> Distilled: hmm that looks odd
[11:26:56] <Eviltwin> I don't have IE here so I guess not
[11:26:59] <ajpiano> i'll see if i can find out what's going on
[11:27:08] <Distilled> ajpiano, it's happening for you too?
[11:27:20] <ajpiano> yes
[11:27:23] <Blaster> Eviltwin: what should I do?
[11:28:12] <Eviltwin> Blaster: If you can isolate a particular line that's not producing a particular expected result, we can help you
[11:28:20] <Eviltwin> Otherwise you're violating jdb
[11:28:22] <Eviltwin> ?jdb
[11:28:22] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[11:29:06] <Blaster> ok
[11:29:24] <Blaster> so when I get the problem on js fiddle, how will you be able to test it in ie 7?
[11:29:32] <Blaster> or be able to see what the bug is
[11:29:35] <NoiseEee> in ie7, using your link on js fiddle.
[11:29:41] <tomasm-> anyone know why doing a show('slide') on a fixed object with "position: fixed; right: 0px; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; width: 300px; z-index: 9999;" (a right-aligned sidebar on top), would slide in with the minimum height and then show 100% height only after the slide is complete?
[11:29:55] <Blaster> NoiseEee: ok
[11:30:02] <Blaster> I'll go write the demo
[11:30:10] <tomasm-> show('slide', { direction: 'right'}), that is
[11:31:36] <Blaster> if I just simplify the problem in files on my server would that be sufficient?
[11:32:02] <Eviltwin> It's not really our job to isolate the problem
[11:32:04] <Eviltwin> It's yours
[11:32:16] <Eviltwin> So try to make a jsFiddle that does the .hide() you want
[11:32:20] <Eviltwin> But doesn't work right in IE7
[11:32:52] <Eviltwin> And we'll try to see if you're doing something wrong or make a suggestion as to how to do it right
[11:33:08] <Eviltwin> But throwing 300 lines of JavaScript and bunch of HTML and CSS at us
[11:33:14] <Eviltwin> And saying, "Where's the problem"
[11:33:21] <Eviltwin> Not really something we want to do
[11:40:48] <ajpiano> Distilled: that should be straightened out now
[11:41:11] <Distilled> ajpiano, yep! thanks!
[11:44:47] <KWhat_Work> there a guide somewhere on throwing custom events
[11:45:14] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: A guide?
[11:45:25] <Eviltwin> see ?.trigger and see ?.bind
[11:45:25] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/

[11:45:40] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: are you trying to do this from within your widget?
[11:45:42] <KWhat_Work> maybe more of a best prac
[11:45:45] <KWhat_Work> yes
[11:45:48] <Eviltwin> Oh
[11:47:05] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide13
[11:48:30] <JTallis> hey, I have a bar that's 12px wide - and I want to be able to drag it up and down within a container with a height of 300px. The x axis is fixed at 0, it's the y that'll change.
[11:48:34] <JTallis> how could I do this?
[11:49:08] <Eviltwin> First take a peek at this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#slider-vertical
[11:49:19] <Eviltwin> And make sure you're not duplicating what's already been done
[11:51:25] <KWhat_Work> soo whats the filterable
[11:51:36] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: Go back several slides
[11:51:44] <Eviltwin> It's the plugin he's building there
[11:51:47] <ajpiano> KWhat_Work: it's the widget is built progres.... ^^
[11:52:19] <KWhat_Work> ahhh
[11:56:57] <KWhat_Work> hmmm having a hard time getting these vents
[11:57:13] <texinwien> has anyone had any luck getting drag and drop to work running on Android?
[11:59:52] <KWhat_Work> So I am calling self._trigger('myevent', e); but its not getting to my .bind of the widget
[12:00:01] <Eviltwin> JTallis: Is this what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/ZSjHK/
[12:00:31] <Eviltwin> KWhat_Work: Are you doing $("#originalwidgetelement").bind("mywidgetmyevent",...) ?
[12:01:14] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: doing $("#originalwidgetelement").mywidget().bind
[12:01:28] <Eviltwin> And binding to what?
[12:01:45] <Eviltwin> And why aren't you just doing .mywidget({"myevent":function(e){...}})
[12:03:28] <JTallis> yes, pretty much Eviltwin, when you slide, the black bar tends to change size slightly ... I mean it doesn't actually change the size, it just glitches... if you know what I mean.
[12:03:35] <sphinxxx> with syntaxhighlighter, is there anyway to set the max width for a block of code?
[12:04:16] <Zeph88> If I have <li class="someClass">sometext</li>, is there a way to replace "sometext"?
[12:05:16] <KWhat_Work> Eviltwin: that works, thanks
[12:05:34] <Eviltwin> Zeph88: see ?.text

[12:08:13] <tomasm-> hi, i have a fixed position box that has 'top: 0px; bottom: 0px; right: 0px; width: 200px;' (a box aligned on the right side of the window), and I try show('slide',{direction: 'right'}), but the container does not take up the viewport's width, as expected, until the animation is complete.... is that a jquery issue or css issue?
[12:09:09] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: What should it look like before and after?
[12:09:37] <fission6> how do i get the object that generated the event from function(e) { } ? i know i can use $(this) but curiousi f there is another way
[12:10:55] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, the box takes up the height of the viewport/window.... as it's animating, it's height is the minimal required to fit the content. once the animation is complete, the height jumps to the window height... problem is if I explicitly put a height, there's no issues (but i'd rather avoid that)
[12:13:03] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Is this kind of what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/Vns4r/
[12:13:05] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, I have it working, but in my case (fixed position, top: 0; bottom: 0), show('slide', {direction: 'right'}) DOES NOT work the same as animate({width: 'toggle'}) (the latter works, btw)
[12:13:12] <Eviltwin> fission6: The object that generated the event?
[12:13:42] <Eviltwin> fission6: Can you explain a bit more what you mean by that?
[12:13:53] <BigVent> How can you send multiple alert(...1...2...3) msgs?
[12:13:53] <BigVent> By adding commas between them?
[12:14:05] <Eviltwin> BigVent: see ?alert
[12:14:06] <bot-t> BigVent, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:14:17] <BigVent> ty again Eviltwin
[12:15:09] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, pretty much.... just seemed something glitchy with show('slide') vs animate({width: "toggle"})
[12:15:23] <Eviltwin> I don't use jQuery UI
[12:15:30] <Eviltwin> It seems to make a few too many decisions for me
[12:15:38] <Eviltwin> And usually doesn't decide to do it the way I wanted to
[12:16:10] <Eviltwin> fission6: $(element).bind(function(e) { /* this === element */ });
[12:16:17] <Eviltwin> That doesn't mean it's where the event originated
[12:16:29] <Eviltwin> And var a = $(element), b = $(element)
[12:16:33] <Eviltwin> a != b
[12:16:42] <Eviltwin> ?eval $("body") == $("body")
[12:16:45] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[12:17:16] <NoiseEee> ?eval $("body")[0] == $("body")[0]
[12:17:18] <bot-t> NoiseEee: true
[12:18:27] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, agreed! im trying to understand what "width: toggle" does .... does it do the movement (via width from 0 to the css determined value) AND show()/hide()?
[12:18:59] <Eviltwin> "width: toggle"?
[12:19:19] <Eviltwin> What code are you referring to?
[12:20:51] <hlveheart> i'll refer to you ;)
[12:26:00] <oxez> Hello. I'm running jquery 1.4.4, and I have an issue with this piece of code: $('select').focus(function() { $(this).addClass("focusField"); }).blur(function() { $(this).removeClass('focusField'); }); - My problem is that in IE (7,8,9) if I click on an input text, then try to click on a <select>, it will not open. It will just get selected, but the droplist will not show with one click. Is there something I could try to fix that? (Note: Clicking a second time will s
[12:27:46] <Eviltwin> If you remove that piece of code, does the expected behavior occur? (i.e. it opens when you click the first time)
[12:28:14] <oxez> Removing the .focus() makes it work
[12:28:42] <Eviltwin> Can you make a demo in jsFiddle?
[12:28:43] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[12:28:43] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:30:00] <oxez> I have one right now: http://jsfiddle.net/mMXfZ/ but the bug is not appearing. I will try to make it (not) work on jsfiddle first, hang on
[12:30:09] <JTallis> ./join #css
[12:30:11] <JTallis> oops
[12:30:13] <jcrawford> is there a way to negate :contains?
[12:30:26] <jcrawford> like I want to only find the elements that do not contain this string
[12:31:05] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: :not
[12:31:15] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: see ?:not
[12:31:16] <bot-t> jcrawford, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[12:31:16] <jQcycleFTW_> does anyone have experience w/ the cycle plugin? I need help. I need to setup a pager nav with one Fx slide transition, and a :prev/next with another  Fx transition but can't find any resources on the subject, seems like a unique requirement..
[12:31:29] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: oh ok I thought that was different and needed something like notContains
[12:31:30] <jcrawford> thanks
[12:31:44] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: :not(...) matches elements that don't match the ...
[12:31:45] <jcrawford> no that's not what i want i don't think....
[12:31:54] <jcrawford> oh so put the contains in the not
[12:31:56] <Eviltwin> Yup
[12:32:00] <jcrawford> gotcha thanks
[12:32:15] <Eviltwin> oxez: We have people make jsFiddles because it forces them to isolate the real problem
[12:32:25] <Eviltwin> oxez: Frequently people will discover their problem is actually somewhere else
[12:32:29] <Eviltwin> Or related to some weird CSS
[12:32:56] <Eviltwin> oxez: jsFiddle has a CSS reset (and so should you): http://jsfiddle.net/css/normalize.css
[12:33:04] <Eviltwin> Not necessarily that one
[12:33:13] <Eviltwin> But something to standardize across the browsers
[12:35:44] <oxez> Eviltwin: Definitely something else is causing the issue, it's just that removing this particular line makes it go away (on the select at least), I'll look into it further
[12:36:13] <oxez> Eviltwin: This site has a few thousands of JS codes, excluding the dozens of plugins loaded, so chances are it's more "complicated" than this one line hehe
[12:36:36] <Eviltwin> Right, you're going to have to ween it down a lot before anyone here will help you
[12:36:39] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ oxez
[12:36:39] <bot-t> oxez, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[12:36:48] <jcrawford> ok i cannot seem to get this to work, here's my issue.  I have 7 different tables on the page, each has a header with 2 columns that have title and value classes assigned.  The issue I am facing is that if there is no report data I need to make the value column on 6 of the tables be 0.  Now they will not contain any data if the report is not generated.  However the 1 table at the top of the page will always have a value set which is something lik
[12:37:20] <jcrawford> I thought I could simply do something like the following but it is not working. input.not($('.panelHeader .value:contains(",")')).html('0'); <-- input is the actual table and not the value column
[12:37:34] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: contains takes a CSS selector
[12:37:48] <Eviltwin> Err
[12:37:52] <Eviltwin> Wait, I'm thinking of somethign else
[12:37:57] <jcrawford> :D
[12:38:04] <Eviltwin> :has
[12:38:09] <Eviltwin> Anyway, proceed
[12:38:15] <jcrawford> what the above code does is essentially create a table tag with a value of 0
[12:38:20] <jcrawford> I need to get at the value column
[12:38:20] <oxez> Eviltwin: yup, I probably won't have to ask here when I find the real issue, if that's the case, thank you for your time
[12:38:31] <Eviltwin> oxez: No problem and good luck
[12:38:39] <jcrawford> no table tags, essentially <table>0</table>
[12:39:36] <jcrawford> I got it :D
[12:39:41] <Eviltwin> Heh
[12:39:49] <jcrawford> input.find('.panelHeader .value').not($('.panelHeader .value:contains(",")')).html('0');
[12:40:08] <jcrawford> thanks Eviltwin :D much appreciated
[12:40:43] <Eviltwin> input.find('.panelHeader .value').not('.panelHeader .value:contains(",")').html('0');
[12:41:02] <Eviltwin> Did you try that?
[12:41:31] <Eviltwin> Or actually I think it would be input.find('.panelHeader .value').not('.value:contains(",")').html('0'); or input.find('.panelHeader .value').not(':contains(",")').html('0');
[12:41:45] <JTallis> Eviltwin, I've changed it slightly http://jsfiddle.net/ZSjHK/6/ this is a css issue but nobody is responding in #css, when you hover the slider - it does show a pointer cursor, but when you slide ... it turns to a select cursor, how can I prevent this and keep it as a pointer?
[12:41:49] <Eviltwin> But then input.find('.panelHeader .value:not(:contains(","))').html('0'); should work just fine
[12:42:35] <jeffsmykil> Best form validation plugin?
[12:42:46] <Eviltwin> JTallis: It's a CSS thing and I suck at CSS
[12:43:30] <Eviltwin> Actually
[12:43:33] <Eviltwin> Wait, I think I fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/ZSjHK/7/
[12:44:00] <JTallis> looks like it
[12:44:22] <Eviltwin> I added the e.preventDefault() to the slideUpdate
[12:44:29] <Eviltwin> That means it prevents the browser's default action for that event
[12:44:39] <Eviltwin> Normally when you put the mouse down and move its to select text
[12:44:43] <Eviltwin> Now it's not doing that any more
[12:44:49] <Zogot_> http://jsfiddle.net/AWNbJ/4/
[12:44:51] <Zogot_> fixed :p
[12:45:07] <JTallis> That's a two in one, Eviltwin - i wanted to prevent the selecting of other text on the page whilst sliding ;) thank you
[12:45:28] <Eviltwin> Zogot_: That's a messy load of browser-specific fixes there :P
[12:45:53] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I've seen .validate used most
[12:46:00] <jeffsmykil> ty
[12:46:03] <JesperA> np
[12:46:05] <Zogot_> aye not the best, i didn't see you put your fix :p.  Not sure how it would act without the browser specific
[12:46:08] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[12:46:24] <Eviltwin> Zogot_: Unpredictably
[12:46:26] <Eviltwin> As it does with them
[12:46:27] <Eviltwin> :P
[12:49:25] <izepstan> very short question: http://jsfiddle.net/XwGEj/1/
[12:50:08] <Eviltwin> The answer is probably you need .delegate('#abn_1',...) instead of .delegate('#abn_1',...)
[12:50:37] <Eviltwin> That is aside from your blatant syntax error
[12:50:42] <xckpd7> anyone using modernizr.... can anyone tell me the advantage of using the .no-js class over using the noscript tag just to display / hide stuff based on javascript availability?
[12:50:44] <Eviltwin> Mismatched ()'s
[12:51:26] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: http://paulirish.com/?s=no-js ?
[12:52:44] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I believe it's more of a flag that JS is now present and loaded vs. the browser doesn't support it
[12:52:46] <skylamer`> i want to make a simple image uploading through local files and the images to be on the clien side, then to manipulate them with jquery, js and otherz :)
[12:53:25] <Eviltwin> skylamer`: I don't believe <input type="file"> allows JavaScript to actually see the file contents
[12:53:31] <skylamer`> is that can be achieved with just the File API and File System APIs? :)
[12:53:38] <skylamer`> mmmmmmmmm
[12:53:44] <DCameronMauch> question about .trigger - is it sych or async
[12:53:47] <DCameronMauch> ?
[12:53:52] <Eviltwin> skylamer`: I would read through this: http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/
[12:53:55] <Eviltwin> DCameronMauch: sync
[12:54:02] <DCameronMauch> thanks
[12:54:23] <someprimetime> when using the optional parameter for clone() to preserve and copy data, does this preserve user input from within the fields?
[12:54:37] <skylamer`> ok, man, i m looking for some thing like a online simply image manipulation with JS ( jquery pixastic ) and so on :)
[12:55:00] <skylamer`> but to be with out any server side thingz
[12:55:53] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: For most things I believe it saves the user input within the field
[12:55:59] <Eviltwin> I don't believe the flags are involved in that at all
[12:56:30] <DCameronMauch> another question about event timing / race condition
[12:56:48] <DCameronMauch> if two events are fired simultaneously
[12:56:58] <DCameronMauch> can postpone processing of one until other completes?
[12:57:14] <Eviltwin> Because events are sync, they actually can't be fired at the same time
[12:57:17] <Eviltwin> One needs to be fired before the other
[12:57:23] <skylamer`> Eviltwin, can i ask you how to make just to "upload" one thing when selecting a file ( image ) , and when select another with the input type file, then the previous one to disappear
[12:57:40] <Eviltwin> skylamer`: I don't really work with uploads through the browser much, sorry
[12:57:50] <skylamer`> i am making something wrong, because they're visible how much i "upload", and all is visible
[12:57:52] <DCameronMauch> case of input type="text" change event, and submit button click event
[12:57:59] <DCameronMauch> which one fires first?
[12:58:01] <skylamer`> its pseudo upload i believ
[12:58:24] <Eviltwin> DCameronMauch: Those are mutually exclusive events, I believe
[12:58:33] <Eviltwin> change and submit aren't related in that way
[12:59:29] <DCameronMauch> if you are currently in the text box, and then click on the submit button, the input loses focus, should trigger change event, and clicking the button shoudl trigger click event
[12:59:33] <skylamer`> i tried with "innerHTML = "" ", but not working very well
[12:59:46] <Eviltwin> DCameronMauch: Oh, I see what you're saying
[13:00:01] <Eviltwin> DCameronMauch: I *believe* the change happens first
[13:00:07] <Eviltwin> But this is a good candidate for...

[13:18:14] <indexwoes> hey people - simple thing, $(this).index(); is 5 when queried, but 42 when queried within an .each() across the whole page. So, if you have a 2nd paragraph in a div, but 40 other paragraphs before, you get two results
[13:18:19] <indexwoes> is this supposed to happen?
[13:18:58] <Mundix> i have a problem usin $.post("api url",function(){}); i can't make it work and i don't have any idea if is my url or my script
[13:19:00] <Eviltwin> You should only get one result unless you've changed the DOM in between

[13:22:30] <Mundix> or the correct way ?
[13:22:51] <NoiseEee> Mundix: post to your backend, and your backend gets the info
[13:22:55] <Mundix> i need to send var post to my server and i do with ajax pure and works fine
[13:31:13] <indexwoes> Why does index get overridden by .each? I do .index() in an element, and get the correct index to parent, but in each, the index() is overridden the each-index, which is already there...
[13:31:42] <indexwoes> What's the best way to get the index of an element relative to parent in an .each?
[13:32:08] <NoiseEee> isn't it  collection.each(function(elementNumber,element)) ?
[13:32:16] <indexwoes> NoiseEee: correct
[13:32:26] <indexwoes> so why is .index() and .index() not equal?
[13:32:31] <Blaster> is there a way to stop IE from caching everything?
[13:32:56] <indexwoes> .index() outside a .each != .index() inside a .each, the former gives the index relative to the parent, the latter, relative to the selection
[13:33:14] <NoiseEee> "IfÂ .index()Â is called on a collection of elements and a DOM element or jQuery object is passed in,Â .index()Â returns an integer indicating the position of the passed element relative to the original collection."
[13:33:15] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: jsFiddle
[13:33:29] <Eviltwin> Blaster: Check StackOverflow
[13:33:30] <NoiseEee> but yeah, fiddle
[13:33:31] <Blaster> the response from an ajax call keeps getting cached in IE :(  I even added date.getTime to the end and it's still cached
[13:33:35] <indexwoes> Thanks NoiseEee
[13:33:36] <someprimetime> how can i clone a div and give it a more unique selector id?
[13:33:40] <someprimetime> instead of the same one?
[13:33:44] <indexwoes> NoiseEee: you understood what I wanted already
[13:33:55] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: is there some part you don't understand?
[13:33:59] <ajpiano> indexwoes: .index() a method on $(this) versus using the 'index' argument provided by the loop are two different things
[13:34:14] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ indexwoes
[13:34:14] <bot-t> indexwoes, Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:34:37] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: I suspect that the problem isn't what you think what it is
[13:37:10] <Eviltwin> People make a lot of assumptions that turn out to be false which is why I generally ask for code if I'm not sure exactly where their problem is
[13:37:26] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: I was just being sure you aren't being facetious in your request, some people have no intention of helping / or no knowledge, but just want to be deletionist in their mindset.
[13:37:41] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: but I agree with you compeletely
[13:37:47] <indexwoes> Completely even
[13:38:19] <indexwoes> also makes that person make a small case to remove other variables, and find out they are wrong, which I think I just did
[13:38:26] <JTallis> I've turned the slider into more of a scroll bar ... my coding is literally a pile of crap but, it's how I learn and I'll work on it even more once I get it to work. This is how far I've got: http://jsfiddle.net/AWNbJ/6/ ... now when you scroll, it doesn't scroll down fully. Usually the scrollers height is dependant on the height of the actual content if you know what I mean. For the scrollers height, it's set 50px and it's at the bo
[13:38:29] <JTallis> big of a fix ... i think
[13:39:57] <JesperA> anyone know if they stopped doing the yayquery podcasts?
[13:40:19] <ajpiano> we haven't stopped in spirit
[13:40:24] <ajpiano> but we also haven't made one in a while
[13:40:26] <ajpiano> sooo
[13:42:06] <Eviltwin> I've never seen yayQuery
[13:42:11] <Eviltwin> What kind of stuff did you guys do?
[13:42:19] <ajpiano> it was a rollicking good time
[13:42:36] <JesperA> that makes me:   :(
[13:42:42] <ajpiano> we just talked about jquery and frontend stuff and drank and made jokes
[13:43:04] <abjorn> maybe in the next 5 months :D
[13:43:51] <ajpiano> perhaps :D
[13:44:17] <Eviltwin> On a number of occasions I drank and then came here to help people
[13:44:25] <Eviltwin> My typo rate shoots through the roof
[13:45:16] <ajpiano> THE ROOF WILL SURVIVE
[13:47:46] <simulation> hello guys, how can i return the selector value :S i need it but i cant fetch it :S
[13:48:01] <simulation> i mean $("xxxx") how can i fetch the xxxx :S
[13:49:19] <abjorn> Eviltwin: My typo rate becomes 100%
[13:49:39] <Eviltwin> simulation: Usually when you need to do that it means you've done something horribly wrong
[13:49:47] <abjorn> And my rate of actually bothering to type an entire sentence becomes 0
[13:49:47] <Eviltwin> simulation: Can you show us the use case?
[13:53:59] <Eviltwin> JTallis: http://jsfiddle.net/AWNbJ/7/
[13:54:25] <Eviltwin> JTallis: I can explain more if you don't understand how it works
[13:55:37] <Eviltwin> I would also probably do this: http://jsfiddle.net/AWNbJ/8/
[13:55:46] <Eviltwin> So that you can just click arbitrarily in the scroll bar and have it jump there
[13:57:23] <JTallis> Zerpex! & Eviltwin, that would be nice.
[13:57:33] <JTallis> I've never been a fan of messing with axis.
[13:57:36] <JTallis> and all that.
[13:57:46] <Eviltwin> JTallis: So when I move the bar down a pixel
[13:57:53] <Eviltwin> That doesn't necessarily mean I want to move the content a pixel
[13:58:08] <JTallis> Right, which is what it was doing before - yes?
[13:58:11] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:58:22] <Eviltwin> What we want is so that when the bar's at the top the content is at the top
[13:58:28] <Eviltwin> And when the bar's at the bottom, the content is at the bottom
[13:58:30] <simulation> Eviltwin: infact i'm manipulating some of data with a tags, im building a tooltip plugin, it manupilates the a tags and moves the a tags into a div. When i moved the a tags (selected ones) the hover function not works :S
[13:58:51] <Eviltwin> So what I did was define two MaxY's
[13:59:17] <Eviltwin> Those represent what we want the tops to be when they're all the way down
[13:59:20] <andrew9183> any idea where tooltip went? was it removed from jquery-ui ?
[13:59:35] <Eviltwin> What I do is take the current offset in the scrollbar
[13:59:45] <Eviltwin> And divide it by the max for the scrollbar
[14:00:02] <Eviltwin> And call it progress
[14:00:07] <Eviltwin> So when progress is 0, it's at the top
[14:00:10] <Mundix> Eviltwin
[14:00:11] <Eviltwin> And when progress is 1 it's at the bottom
[14:00:27] <Eviltwin> Then I use the Math.max and Math.min to make sure it never goes below 0 or above 1
[14:00:57] <Eviltwin> And now I can multiply that by the scrollMaxY to find the new position for the scrollbar and multiplty it by contentMaxY to find the new position for the content
[14:01:02] <Eviltwin> At progress = 0, they are both 0
[14:01:16] <Eviltwin> At progress = 1, the scrollbar goes to scrollMaxY and the content goes to contentMaxY
[14:01:24] <Eviltwin> And linearly in between
[14:01:28] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[14:01:44] <simulation> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/ZDXYS8Cg this is the html before runnin plugin and after runnin plugin.
[14:01:57] <Eviltwin> simulation: I'm sorry, I forgot what the issue was
[14:02:01] <Eviltwin> What did you need help with?
[14:02:22] <JTallis> I thikn so, I'll need to read it over and over again.
[14:02:41] <andrew9183> anyone ?
[14:02:46] <simulation> i need to fetch the selector value of a function :S i mean for example $("#id") how can i fetch the #id.
[14:03:05] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: this was the fiddle I made that didn't show the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/KEbyS/
[14:03:07] <Eviltwin> simulation: Oh, right
[14:03:12] <Eviltwin> And why?
[14:03:16] <simulation> im manipulating the html as here http://pastebin.com/ZDXYS8Cg and i cant get hover function for the a after the manipulating
[14:03:32] <Eviltwin> indexwoes:  see ?alert
[14:03:32] <bot-t> indexwoes, Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[14:03:53] <indexwoes> yet I have near identical code, and I am getting ... weird values as hell. 115 instead of 5. trying to trace it, because the layout is the same
[14:03:57] <kborchers> andrew9183: wat? Tooltip hasn't been released. it is planned for 1.9 http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Tooltip
[14:04:26] <indexwoes> indexwoes: disregard that - use safari or chrome and use console.log() there, and also with nightlies a lot of COOL debug stuff!
[14:04:30] <Eviltwin> simulation: Can you make a jsFiddle example of what manipulations you are doing the require a selector for a collection?
[14:05:28] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: You're aware of how ind and $(this).index() mean different things here, right?
[14:06:07] <derppy> I'm adjusting the width of a carousel to fit the page on window's resize-event. It works fine when I resize the window. However, manually triggering $("window").resize(); doesn't work the same way. Any idea what could be causing it?
[14:06:18] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: I know, that is the point
[14:06:22] <andrew9183> thanks kborchers
[14:06:26] <indexwoes> Here is all works, this shows that I understand it
[14:06:45] <indexwoes> What I don't get it, how almost the same code is giving values that are way off
[14:06:55] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: So this code produces what you'd expect?
[14:06:58] <indexwoes> on my setup I am getting 115 instead of 5 for instance
[14:07:05] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: yes, this fiddle produces what I expect
[14:07:24] <indexwoes> I started with a p select, then made it a class, added extra classes, in case it was a side-issue
[14:07:32] <Eviltwin> What I suggest doing is using the console and also doing a console.log on the .parent() when you spit out the index
[14:07:39] <Eviltwin> And see if the parent is right
[14:07:46] <indexwoes> Eviltwin: I checked, parent has 15 children
[14:07:58] <indexwoes> yet $(this).index() is 115
[14:08:08] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: Not really sure what to say then
[14:08:10] <Eviltwin> Is this site live?
[14:08:40] <indexwoes> in the same output I get : $(this).parent().children().size() = 15, $(this).index() = 115
[14:08:46] <indexwoes> not live
[14:08:49] <Eviltwin> simulation: If you need to turn a jQuery collection into a selector, you are almost certainly doing something horribly wrong
[14:08:53] <Eviltwin> simulation: Which is why I ask
[14:09:06] <indexwoes> it is all dynamic components, which is why I was tweaking the fiddle to see if I could break it
[14:09:36] <Eviltwin> indexwoes: Could you paste the relevant block of JS?
[14:09:43] <Eviltwin> To pastebin or something
[14:10:14] <indexwoes> ok, I solved it :)
[14:10:30] <indexwoes> I was using the index I've set previously, stupid copy-paste, bad naming hask
[14:10:54] <indexwoes> hack - normally name things right, and I was thinking 'nr' was the local, it was something entirely different, I was just hacking something up. disregard this ISC etc.
[14:12:04] <Eviltwin> simulation?
[14:12:11] <Eviltwin> Mundix?
[14:12:27] <Mundix> hey
[14:12:40] <Mundix> sorry wait
[14:12:48] <Eviltwin> $.post is AJAX
[14:17:24] <Mundix> http://www.pastie.org/3049586
[14:17:29] <Mundix> there
[14:19:00] <Eviltwin> Is this page at http://www.tamocomotamo.com/ ?
[14:19:05] <Eviltwin> The page this code is on
[14:19:23] <someprimetime> nice my site made PC Mag's top 100 websites of 2011 :o
[14:20:32] <Mundix> yes
[14:20:39] <Mundix> but is a json api
[14:20:39] <Eviltwin> Mundix: And what's happening?
[14:20:51] <Mundix> if you usee the chrome advanced rest
[14:21:34] <Mundix> the api url correct is http://www.tamocomotamo.com/tctapi/login/test_post but with the api work's without the post prefix
[14:21:51] <Eviltwin> The POST prefix?
[14:22:05] <Eviltwin> Are you saying it's expecting the request to be in JSON?
[14:22:23] <Eviltwin> The "json" at the end there actually refers to the response type
[14:23:07] <Mundix> i guest but on the jquery $.post docs says that and i don't have the minimal idea
[14:23:46] <Mundix> hows works and my response came in json type
[14:24:00] <Mundix> if you use the chrome Advanced Rest Client you may understand
[14:25:52] <Eviltwin> I suggest you see ?.ajax
[14:25:53] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:26:07] <Eviltwin> Namely the contentType
[14:26:40] <Eviltwin> And also using JSON.stringify on the data before passing it in
[14:26:47] <Eviltwin> I have to leave now
[14:26:47] <Mundix> yeap and i don't understand 100%
[14:26:50] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[14:26:57] <Mundix> thnks
[14:26:59] <Mundix> anyway
[14:27:07] <Mundix> i have to go to
[14:33:15] <KWhat_Work> is there a way to check to see if an effect is in progress
[14:34:27] <nthchildEffects> if top and left are set using :nth-child selector then jquery UI effects don't work (they lose the positioning of the element)
[14:34:39] <aerospa> :
[14:34:58] <nthchildEffects> why is that? jquery can't be looking at the class for position data can it? it must be asking the element itself what its top,left is, amiright?
[14:36:00] <nthchildEffects> anyone up on jquery UI, in particular the effects?
[14:36:25] <nthchildEffects> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects
[14:36:29] <KWhat_Work> nthchildEffects: working on it right now
[14:36:46] <nthchildEffects> KWhat_Work: you mean you are working on the fix? oh :) awesome, want some help?
[14:36:52] <Blaster> hey guys any idea why this script alert()'s "undefined"? http://pastebin.com/43QcKXaC
[14:37:05] <KWhat_Work> no im working on the effects
[14:37:28] <nthchildEffects> KWhat_Work: you mean editing jquery code, or just using the effects?
[14:37:36] <KWhat_Work> useing them
[14:37:44] <KWhat_Work> i just saw your question, or statement
[14:38:04] <nthchildEffects> http://jsfiddle.net/hSxfn/  <- oh, nevermind. but here is a testcase, click the nth squares, and click the :p squares
[14:39:10] <nthchildEffects> How is the effect getting the top,left from the element, and why is that changing just because it is using an nth-child - aaaah, I know. it is cloning the elements
[14:39:16] <nthchildEffects> so they no longer are the same nths?
[14:39:21] <nthchildEffects> maaaaaabbe, maybe not.
[14:39:39] <nthchildEffects> But, ffs, can't it convert the style to a new 'I am here' position?
[14:39:47] <nthchildEffects> anyone up on jquery UI effects?
[14:40:00] <nthchildEffects> so , KWhat_Work .... what are you working on with effects?
[14:40:09] <KWhat_Work> what are you trying to do
[14:40:20] <nthchildEffects> http://jsfiddle.net/hSxfn/ <- here you can see the testcase KWhat_Work
[14:40:37] <KWhat_Work> yah im looking at it
[14:40:42] <nthchildEffects> Just apply effects, but when using nth-child to set positions (dynamic interface) the effects are losing the position
[14:40:47] <KWhat_Work> so i guess :p:P is what your expecting
[14:40:53] <nthchildEffects> click the nth yellow, they jump left
[14:41:02] <nthchildEffects> click the :p, they don't jump left
[14:41:18] <nthchildEffects> KWhat_Work: which do you think is the right behavior? jump left... or don't jump left?
[14:41:18] <KWhat_Work> ahhh ok
[14:41:42] <KWhat_Work> nthchildEffects: its because its an position:absolute
[14:41:43] <nthchildEffects> notice I put the top elsewhere -they keep their top, they lose the left, which is the part of the position defined in the nth-child selector
[14:41:56] <nthchildEffects> KWhat_Work: nope, the others are absolute too, and they work
[14:42:21] <KWhat_Work> ahh there it is
[14:42:27] <nthchildEffects> the only difference is if the class defines the position without an nth-child selector or not (that's why I made those classes to illustrate)
[14:42:35] <mastermaker> slaves
[14:43:12] <nthchildEffects> I could look into the effect myself, but I imagine some annoyingly obfuscated means of getting the location, instead of simple code, but hell, lemme try
[14:43:59] <mastermaker> slaves
[14:46:48] <sphinxxx> is there anyway to make javascript select all text in a div?
[14:46:52] <sphinxxx> like actually highlight
[14:47:00] <mastermaker> sleaves
[14:47:00] <sphinxxx> hightlight/select it
[14:47:09] <coldhead> you need a plugin to do it across browsers, sphinxxx
[14:47:15] <coldhead> they all different and stupid
[14:47:36] <mastermaker> slaves
[14:49:59] <KWhat_Work> nthchildEffects: your own your own on this one, my guess is that the CSS :nth-child(X) is not getting applied because the order is changing due to some wrapper applied to the elements by the effect.
[14:51:03] <nthchildEffects> Yeah, just animate works... hrm
[14:51:15] <nthchildEffects> so, new thing, is http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2009/08/07/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale.html this patch for rotate and scale still necessary?
[14:55:29] <da-beginner> question: http://jsfiddle.net/eSv36/   --- how do i select only the <a>s after the submenu?
[14:55:56] <nthchildEffects> eh, well, so I worked around by created nn... classes (n1,n2,n3) and since it is all dynamic and shizzle it works. hurrah. time for more coffee
[14:56:05] <nthchildEffects> KWhat_Work: what are you working on though/
[14:56:09] <nthchildEffects> or just fiddling around?
[14:59:48] <KWhat_Work> nthchildEffects: working on creating a usable drop-in form plugin
[15:00:08] <KWhat_Work> all the garbage out there is huge and only works with a few elements
[15:00:11] <da-beginner> question: http://jsfiddle.net/eSv36/   --- how do i select only the <a>s after the submenu?
[15:03:16] <KWhat_Work> da-beginner: http://jsfiddle.net/eSv36/3/
[15:04:03] <KWhat_Work> da-beginner: .nextAll if you want them all
[15:33:16] <sorahn> hey guys, i'm trying to use .on() and it's throwing a type undefined error.      $('#menu-button').on('click', function() {  });
[15:33:25] <sorahn> but if i use .bind() it works.
[15:33:27] <sorahn> any ideas?
[15:33:37] <Axsuul> on accepts three arguments
[15:33:54] <Axsuul> $(document).on('click', '#menu-button', function() { });
[15:34:45] <sorahn> are the docs wrong then?
[15:34:50] <sorahn> $("button").on("click", notify);
[15:35:58] <Axsuul> hmm on which line is it throwing the error
[15:36:13] <sorahn> the line with the selector (the one i pasted above)
[15:36:15] <coldhead> ?on
[15:36:16] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:36:32] <sorahn> yes, i'm reading that page
[15:36:46] <coldhead> i am checking if the docs are wrong
[15:36:53] <coldhead> they look good to me
[15:37:02] <sorahn> .on('click', function(event) {    is the line that throws the error
[15:37:17] <Axsuul> can you paste your full code?
[15:37:38] <sorahn> this is all i have.
[15:37:38] <sorahn> http://pastebin.com/Ha6wgRME
[15:37:58] <sorahn> I had an alert in there, but i pulled it to see if that was doing it.
[15:38:57] <Axsuul> sorahn: http://jsfiddle.net/L6nGn/
[15:39:55] <sorahn> the only difference is that mine is an <a> tag
[15:40:00] <coldhead> sorahn: http://jsfiddle.net/FTD9p/
[15:40:04] <coldhead> your code works for me
[15:40:36] <coldhead> do you have the right version of jQuery?
[15:40:38] <khan> hey im teaching my self jquery and i was wondering if there are ways to test my skills
[15:40:40] <Axsuul> sorahn: shouldn't matter
[15:40:51] <sorahn> coldhead: yea, loading 1.7 off the code server
[15:41:32] <sorahn> the error is this: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('#menu-button').on('click', function(event){
[15:41:42] <coldhead> khan: try the exercises here: http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-6
[15:41:45] <coldhead> the last one is a good test
[15:41:56] <coldhead> Create a Slideshow
[15:42:12] <khan> thank you
[15:43:48] <someprimetime> i'm trying to alert my a ison response which comes back as: {"message": "test"} but when i do alert(data.message) it comes back as undefined
[15:43:49] <someprimetime> any reason?
[15:44:21] <coldhead> someprimetime: jquery may not be aware that you're returning JSON
[15:44:25] <coldhead> try console.log(data)
[15:44:31] <coldhead> see if that logs a string or an object
[15:45:51] <Axsuul> I'm getting a problem where if I click on a element that is a child of an element with .on() attached to it, it doesn't seem to be getting a current DOM (like if an element is visible or not). However, changing it from .on() to .bind() works... Has anyone experienced this?
[15:47:13] <BinaryKitten> Axsuul .bind is soon to be gone.
[15:47:37] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin some demo code that you see the issue with?
[15:48:06] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: my code looks like this, and I can't reproduct it in jsFiddle: https://gist.github.com/be4c5ff4b305478ecde2
[15:48:20] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: so if I click on the .inlay, it doesn't seem to toggle correctly
[15:48:26] <Axsuul> but if I click outside within the .button, it works
[15:49:28] <coldhead> bind will be with us until 2.0, surely
[15:50:16] <BinaryKitten> Axsuul.. ok looks like you're using it in delegation mode..
[15:50:27] <BinaryKitten> let me just check the api docs for a mo
[15:51:00] <Axsuul> Thanks
[15:51:48] <BinaryKitten> Axsuul are the elements always going to be there?
[15:51:54] <sorahn> so for the record, .bind works exactly as it should, but .on doesn't
[15:51:55] <sorahn> :(
[15:51:59] <sorahn> but .on works elsewher
[15:52:02] <sorahn> i have no idea what's going on
[15:52:22] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: nope, they will be manipulated in the future
[15:52:40] <BinaryKitten> Axsuul you mean inserted?
[15:53:05] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: yep
[15:53:15] <BinaryKitten> ok..
[15:53:30] <BinaryKitten> are they going to be anywhere in the document?
[15:53:49] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: ok wow that's odd... i changed from .on(document) to .on('body') and it works fine
[15:54:21] <BinaryKitten> urm .on('body') ??
[15:54:22] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: aye, anywhere in document, but definitely within <body>
[15:54:27] <sorahn> Axsuul: thats kind of like the same kind of weirdnewss i'm having... :\
[15:55:14] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: yep, instead of $(document).on('click', 'a.button', function() { ... }), now using $('body').on('click', 'a.button', function { ... }) works as intended
[15:55:25] <KWhat_Work> can you have a widget that extends another widget
[15:55:27] <Axsuul> Something with delegating to document
[15:55:33] <BinaryKitten> ok that's not what you said Axsuul  lol..
[15:55:44] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: i was referring to this code https://gist.github.com/be4c5ff4b305478ecde2
[15:55:48] <Axsuul> sorry
[15:55:48] <BinaryKitten> .on('body') !== $('body').on
[15:56:21] <BinaryKitten> also Axsuul  save teh dom query .. $(document.body).on
[15:57:12] <Axsuul> BinaryKitten: cool, thanks.. hmm but any reason why it would be acting weird for document?
[15:57:23] <BinaryKitten> not too sure
[15:57:41] <BinaryKitten> but i expect .delegate would possibly do the same
[15:57:55] <BinaryKitten> since you're using .on in delegate mode rather than bind mode
[15:58:02] <BinaryKitten> sorahn what issue are you having/
[15:58:33] <sorahn> BinaryKitten: an issue with .on sometimes working...
[15:58:40] <sorahn> sec, paste incoming
[15:58:43] <BinaryKitten> can you give example :)
[15:58:45] <BinaryKitten> cool
[15:58:59] <sorahn> it's up there somewhere but i'll make another one
[15:59:20] <sorahn> https://gist.github.com/1503872
[15:59:45] <sorahn> if i use .on insetd of .bind i get a Type Undefined error.
[15:59:54] <sorahn> however, i've got multiple jsfiddles of it working
[16:00:02] <sorahn> and i've used the same thing elsewhere that works.
[16:00:11] <Axsuul> this is your javascript console saying this?
[16:00:24] <sorahn> yea the safari console
[16:00:37] <BinaryKitten> sorahn which version of jquery are you using locally?
[16:00:46] <sorahn> 1.7 hosted on code.jq.com
[16:00:48] <Axsuul> any way you can post screenshot of the error and trace? ={p
[16:01:17] <sorahn> i could if our dev site hadn't just been taken down by a random php error... D:
[16:01:26] * sorahn waits patiently
[16:02:10] <sorahn> the error is this: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating  '$('#menu-button').on('click', function(event){
[16:04:08] <Axsuul> have you tried another browser
[16:04:19] <Axsuul> use chrome if you can
[16:06:09] <sorahn> same problem on chrome
[16:06:16] <sorahn> and ios mobile (what i'm actually developing for)
[16:06:27] <BinaryKitten> sorahn quick test..
[16:06:31] <sorahn> sure
[16:06:51] <BinaryKitten> console.log($, $('#menu-button'));
[16:06:59] <BinaryKitten> what do you get
[16:07:23] <sorahn> https://gist.github.com/1503893
[16:07:53] <sorahn> and there, I just updated it with the error.
[16:08:45] <sorahn> for the record i'm using jquery mobile as well, however i have a nother page where basically the same thing is working.
[16:08:46] <BinaryKitten> certainly a strange one
[16:09:02] <sorahn> and like i said, if i change it to .bind it works fine.
[16:09:38] <david27> have you tried triggering an external function from .on rather than on within the event?
[16:10:03] <sorahn> i haven't.
[16:11:15] <BinaryKitten> sorahn what do you get for console.log(jQuery.fn.on) ?
[16:11:31] <BinaryKitten> (illiminating all possibilities here)
[16:12:05] <sorahn> ohhh... 'undefined'
[16:12:15] <david27> the docs mention $("p").on("click", {foo: "bar"}, myHandler) you could try removing the data passing bit.
[16:12:17] <BinaryKitten> are you using 1.6.4 ?
[16:12:21] <sorahn> no
[16:12:31] <sorahn> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[16:12:32] <BinaryKitten> strange
[16:13:41] <sorahn> :(
[16:14:10] <sorahn> i just tried moving the script tag around to see if that was it, and putting it right next ot my scriptsrc i still get undefined
[16:14:26] <sorahn>  /cry
[16:14:44] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know how to extend a widget ?
[16:15:05] <sorahn> i'm goign to leave it on bind for now and finish working
[16:17:55] <BinaryKitten> yep sorahn the only thing i can see is that the version of jquery you have cached/linked to is returning undefined for the .on method. Which should not be happening at all. You will need to check that, try downloading 1.7.1 and linking locally and see if you get the same issues
[16:19:05] <BinaryKitten> if console.log(jQuery.fn.on); outputs undefined ... then you have a bigger issue than it not doing what you expect..
[16:19:11] <someprimetime> coldhead: it comes back as an object with console.log(data)
[16:19:28] <someprimetime> within the promise: object since i'm using the jquery form helper: responseText: "{"message": "test"}"
[16:19:31] <BinaryKitten> sorahn there could be other parts of the codebase which are also undefined.. leaving you more headaches
[16:20:21] <sorahn> that's crazy
[16:20:49] <sorahn> i swear i had the cache turned off to for safari
[16:20:53] <sorahn> to try and prevent this very thing
[16:21:11] <BinaryKitten> sorahn yes it is crazy   but so is jQuery.fn.on being undefined in 1.7 ...
[16:21:32] <sorahn> hmm, same thing in chrome shows the function.
[16:21:37] <sorahn> (same site)
[16:21:47] <sorahn> dumped the conten settings in safari and its still undefined
[16:21:48] <sorahn> D:::::
[16:22:01] <BinaryKitten> definitely a browser issue then
[16:22:14] <BinaryKitten> hate issues like that
[16:22:31] <BinaryKitten> sorahn are you by happenchance serving from a virtualmachine?
[16:22:52] <sorahn> i don't think our dev server is a vm
[16:22:53] <sorahn> no.
[16:23:16] <sorahn> and again, same site, no changes, chrome gets the function as its supposed to, and safari doesn't
[16:23:22] <BinaryKitten> i've seen this happen with a vm before, the vm does a cache thing ... not always good.
[16:23:35] <BinaryKitten> sorahn clear the cache in safari?
[16:23:38] <sorahn> did
[16:23:52] <sorahn> and this too: http://sorahn.com/s/8dftm86wk35dwks.png
[16:23:54] <sorahn> for good measure
[16:24:03] <BinaryKitten> and still the same issue ? darn
[16:24:07] <sorahn> yea
[16:24:47] <BinaryKitten> not sure what to say about safari sorahn, other than Sorry
[16:24:52] <sorahn> haha
[16:25:06] <BinaryKitten> at least we've found out the issue :)
[16:25:28] <sorahn> indeed
[16:25:28] <BinaryKitten> is safari the latest?
[16:25:31] <sorahn> yes
[16:25:34] <sorahn> updated today actually
[16:25:43] <sorahn> is 1.7.1 hosted on jquery.com ?
[16:26:03] <sorahn> i wonder if just switching to that...
[16:26:19] <sorahn> ok what the fuck
[16:26:29] <sorahn> that can't be a caching issue
[16:26:31] <BinaryKitten> heh it now works in safari?
[16:26:36] <sorahn> no
[16:26:38] <sorahn> still doesnt
[16:26:48] <BinaryKitten> what's happend?
[16:27:09] <sorahn> no like, nothing has happened.  how could changing to a script that i've never used not fix it?
[16:27:19] <sorahn> if i load the script, and search for .on i can SEE the function there.
[16:27:30] <sorahn> and if i load a js fiddle using 1.7 or 1.7.7 in the same browser they work
[16:27:38] <sorahn> 1.7.1
[16:28:07] <KWhat_Work> ehhh WTF, you cannot create a widget my.name.space ?
[16:28:11] <BinaryKitten> now i do not have a clue what to tell you
[16:28:51] <sorahn> i remember now that i was having this trouble before becuae i was trying to use .on for the mobile init function in jquery mobile
[16:28:54] <sorahn> but it wasn't working either
[16:29:25] <BinaryKitten> KWhat_Work Not sure how to answer that statement
[16:29:46] <BinaryKitten> think like jeapourdy, phrase it like a question....
[16:29:54] <sorahn> o.O
[16:29:59] * BinaryKitten can't spell properly at 00:29
[16:30:25] <BinaryKitten> sorahn are you at the wall meet head stage?
[16:30:35] <KWhat_Work> BinaryKitten: when i create a widget that has the name space my.name.space, I can access $.my and $.my.name  but $.my.name.space doesnt exist
[16:30:35] <sorahn> close
[16:31:12] <BinaryKitten> sorahn i'll get some padding...
[16:31:40] * BinaryKitten decides this is an ample time to go to bed
[16:31:42] <someprimetime> i'm returning this data object back which contains: responseText: "{"response": "test"}" and from using jquery form plugin, but when i try to alert(data.response) it comes back as undefined
[16:31:45] <someprimetime> any idea why?
[16:31:53] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime what are you headers?
[16:32:01] <BinaryKitten> are you returning the right content type?
[16:32:22] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: Accept:application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
[16:32:28] <BinaryKitten> that's accept
[16:32:31] <BinaryKitten> not content type
[16:32:37] <someprimetime> woops
[16:32:44] <KWhat_Work> someone really fucked this one up
[16:32:44] <BinaryKitten> and thats a request header, not a response header
[16:32:49] <someprimetime> Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8
[16:32:52] <someprimetime> sorry bout that
[16:32:57] <BinaryKitten> :D
[16:33:17] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime switch that out so it returns Content-Type:application/json
[16:33:24] <BinaryKitten> and it might solve the issue
[16:33:30] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: cool thanks!
[16:47:01] <Mayank> Hi, how can I convert  json type string to a json object?
[16:47:43] <sorahn> holy wtf...
[16:48:00] <sorahn> BinaryKitten: it only happens in safari using the mobile user agent
[16:48:15] <solidus-river> is there a way to make a div 50% of the window height even if its parent is not the browser window?
[16:49:19] <BinaryKitten> solidus-river $('div').height(window.height / 2)
[16:49:41] <solidus-river> BinaryKitten: hmm, but now way via css?
[16:50:04] <BinaryKitten> check a css channel
[16:50:21] * BinaryKitten is not well versed in CSS tricks
[16:50:42] <sorahn> tricks is exactly what CSS is
[16:50:55] <BinaryKitten> nah CSS is rules
[16:51:00] <sorahn> css is the art of tricking your browser into doing what you want with out telling it, because if you tell it, it won't do it.
[16:51:01] <BinaryKitten> CSS Tricks are bending the rules
[16:51:02] <adam-_-> so this site has a really cool footer playlist thing: http://www.vupas.com/. but from looking at the source of the page I can't work out how it works at all. I don't really understand why I can't see any jquery/javascript in the page? surely that is what's powering this?
[16:51:36] <sorahn> so yea BinaryKitten the saga goes on, only for the mobile user agent in safari.  what the actual fuck.
[16:52:47] <imsky> awwwwwhhhhhhright
[16:53:17] <BinaryKitten> urm adam-_- either you're blind to lines 19-48 of the source, or you're just trying to advertise the site
[16:54:11] <[unf]> how can I go about writing something to track the mouse position so when the mouse is below the line, it will scroll down and expose the rest of the content in the box, but when it's above the line it will scroll up to it's original position

[16:55:38] <solidus-river> as in the changes made to the style will be applied to all elements now and in the future
[16:55:39] <BinaryKitten> you want it by mouse [unf]?
[16:56:14] <[unf]> BinaryKitten yeah I believe so... I was thinking maybe I would make a button on the top and bottom... but I think maybe just a mouse position would be easier, what's your opinion?
[16:56:17] <[unf]> it's for an image gallery
[16:56:18] <adam-_-> BinaryKitten: well yes I saw the javascript includes but couldn't work out what was custom code. I've just realised which of those is...
[16:57:51] <BinaryKitten> button is a lot easier
[16:58:08] <BinaryKitten> or even a part of the text that triggers the effect [unf]
[16:58:22] <BinaryKitten> tracking the mouse is intensive if not done correctly
[16:58:46] <[unf]> well I found some clientX clientY stuff on getting the position
[16:59:02] <BinaryKitten> right.. but you have to check those for every minute mouse movement
[16:59:03] <[unf]> but I couldn't figure out how to access it's properties like if (clientX > 200) {}blah
[16:59:18] <BinaryKitten> event gets passed in
[16:59:25] <BinaryKitten> console.dir(event)
[16:59:41] <[unf]> yeah so I believe I should just use a couple buttons
[16:59:42] <BinaryKitten> that will list the properties of event with their values
[16:59:56] <BinaryKitten> [unf] is it for content?
[17:00:04] <[unf]> it's an image gallery
[17:00:09] <[unf]> with a bunch of thumbnaisl
[17:00:21] <BinaryKitten> ok.. and what do you want to show and when
[17:01:01] <[unf]> i'll update the fiddle one sec
[17:02:03] <sorahn> so... does jquery use any like browser capability detection to switch anything?
[17:02:08] <bonhoffer> anyone know why my format . . . 12/20/2011 for jquery datepicker -- i can't find where i set it
[17:02:14] <bonhoffer> i don't think i did
[17:02:21] <BinaryKitten> sorahn not that i know of
[17:02:23] <sorahn> is it possible that mobile safari doesn't support whatever .on() does ?
[17:02:29] <sorahn> so it just empties out
[17:02:30] <BinaryKitten> it does feature detection, but not browser
[17:02:58] <BinaryKitten> .on is just a unified method that will replace .bind, .delegate and .live
[17:03:07] <sorahn> yea, that's what i thought
[17:03:14] <sorahn> but i'm out of explanations
[17:03:22] <BinaryKitten> the code around it doesn't have any feature detection
[17:03:33] <bonhoffer> i searched the code for formatDate -- but can't see that i set it anywhere -- what is the default?
[17:03:39] <sorahn> then, i officially give up.
[17:04:59] <sorahn> i cannot explain why it would work on one site, and not on another, in the same browser using the same source for code.
[17:05:11] <BinaryKitten> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate @ bonhoffer
[17:06:17] <BinaryKitten> well at 17:12 sorahn if you can't get it i can't at 01:06
[17:06:25] <bonhoffer> BinaryKitten: I got that, but I am wondering if the standard is 12/20/2011
[17:06:28] <BinaryKitten> sorry can't be more help
[17:06:31] <bonhoffer> mm/dd/yyyy
[17:06:35] <BinaryKitten> yes
[17:06:38] <sorahn> yea, no worries.
[17:06:43] <bonhoffer> BinaryKitten: that is the default
[17:06:46] <bonhoffer> ?

[17:11:38] <[unf]> something like that.... I guess
[17:11:54] <BinaryKitten> [unf] you just almost missed me
[17:12:01] <[unf]> oh sorry to bother :)
[17:12:28] <BinaryKitten> [unf] use mouseenter and mouseleave

[17:13:16] <[unf]> I have no idea how to even go about it
[17:13:17] <[unf]> :/
[17:13:18] <[unf]> not very familiar with js
[17:13:22] <[unf]> do you know of any good tutorials?
[17:13:32] <BinaryKitten> urm .. not at this moment
[17:13:35] <[unf]> or could you just give me some logic idea
[17:13:40] <snover> bot-t: could you stop forgetting stuff?
[17:13:41] <bot-t> snover, My reply is no.
[17:13:45] <snover> jerk.
[17:14:06] <snover> anyway bk it is hard to link to plugins since the site died
[17:14:12] <BinaryKitten> hoverintent, if you intend to hover over the up area (or down) then scroll
[17:14:24] <snover> the great plugin massacre of 2012

[17:15:06] * BinaryKitten goes to make a hot water bottle and go sleep before 2am
[17:15:08] <[unf]> so the logic would be to add some css for overflow: scroll?
[17:15:16] <BinaryKitten> urm no
[17:15:22] <BinaryKitten> logic would be to scroll
[17:15:40] <coldhead> goodnight BK! i like your new twitter avatar!
[17:15:44] <BinaryKitten> again it's too late for me to talk logic
[17:15:48] <BinaryKitten> coldhead thanks
[17:15:57] <[unf]> okay thanks anyways
[17:16:03] <[unf]> the scroll is a feature of jquery or js?
[17:16:11] <BinaryKitten> the browser
[17:16:28] <BinaryKitten> Javascript can just tell teh browser where the scrollTop is
[17:17:23] <[unf]> alright well thanks for the advice
[17:17:25] <BinaryKitten> [unf] maybe look at http://flesler.blogspot.com/2009/05/jqueryscrollto-142-released.html
[17:17:58] <BinaryKitten> and possibly a setTimeout
[17:18:22] <BinaryKitten> and lots of christmas presents for all the lovely helpers in the channel :p

[17:31:09] <sorahn> got an automated message
[17:45:05] <Rotham> hey.. im building a plugin with jquery ui's .widget .. I want to listen to an event from another plugin (this plugin starts a date picker widget), and call a function when the date picker widget changes... I cant use this.function since it is in the context of the datepicker, not my plugin...
[17:45:28] <Rotham> how can I call a function on the current instance of my plugin?
[18:22:19] <sagreenxyz> amateur question regarding a jQuery topic - loose coupling.  Am I in the right place?
[18:23:09] <sagreenxyz> between DOM and objects I'm needing to create/use
[18:37:53] <joikus> why would jquery
[18:37:56] <joikus> er
[18:38:17] <coldhead> :D
[18:38:24] <joikus> well?
[18:38:27] <joikus> jk typing my Q :P
[18:39:20] <joikus> why would jquery's hide() show() cause in IE7 only, (using css3pie if it matters), get rid of my input text's border altogether? but there's no issue if my container around that input text was NOT display:none initially
[18:39:41] <Eviltwin> Try removing css3pie and see what happens?
[18:40:02] <joikus> border appears, but square as expected
[18:40:14] <joikus> otherwise it works flawlessly
[18:40:25] <joikus> it's only when I hide/show on dom ready, don't get it
[18:46:10] <Eviltwin> Does css3pie use any JavaScript?
[18:46:59] <joikus> I think so yea
[18:50:24] <Eviltwin> joikus: I would try doing setTimeout(function(){/*your code*/},0);
[18:50:28] <Eviltwin> Or maybe like 17 instead of 0
[18:50:51] <Eviltwin> It means you'll have a little flash of it being there
[18:51:04] <Eviltwin> But it might give css3pie time to do its work
[18:56:45] <systemfault> Is the authoring tutorial on the main website the "standard" to write plugins?
[18:57:28] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery plugin authoring
[18:57:29] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:58:45] <systemfault> Wanted to be sure that tutorial is really the "norm" and not just an easy way for beginners.
[18:59:05] <Eviltwin> The pros write plugins similar to that last one
[18:59:20] <Eviltwin> But if you're into something that sophisticated
[18:59:26] <Eviltwin> Look at the jQuery UI widget
[18:59:35] <Eviltwin> ?g ajpiano widget factory
[18:59:36] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[18:59:39] <mrryanjohnston> Am I able to use selectors with removeClass in order to remove all classes in a given element that start with foo ?
[18:59:40] <Eviltwin> That thing
[18:59:52] <Eviltwin> mrryanjohnston: You should probably use the callback for that
[18:59:54] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Thank you :)
[18:59:56] <Eviltwin> mrryanjohnston: see ?.removeClass
[18:59:57] <bot-t> mrryanjohnston, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[19:00:04] <Eviltwin> See the second syntax
[19:00:48] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: ok, cool. thanks
[19:00:49] <Eviltwin> Something like .removeClass(function(index,class){return /^foo/.test(class)});
[19:01:07] <Eviltwin> A regex will likely be your friend there
[19:01:32] <Eviltwin> Or class.substring(0,foo.length) === foo if foo is a var
[19:01:48] <Eviltwin> Good luck!
[19:04:56] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: probably will side with a regex. Thank you!
[19:09:25] <jamescarr> anyone know of some good growl like notification scripts? Basically need stackable notifications that I can embed a form in without any problems...
[19:09:44] <jamescarr> also needs to easily be toggleable. For example, certain serverside events will make it fade away.
[19:10:52] <jamescarr> currently looking at http://boedesign.com/demos/gritter/
[19:14:14] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: what is the .test(class) bit of what you're doing there?
[19:14:28] <mrryanjohnston> did you mean text?
[19:14:46] <Eviltwin> IIRC regex.test(string) is one of the syntaxes for checking a regex called regex against a string called string
[19:14:56] <mrryanjohnston> hm
[19:15:00] <mrryanjohnston> where can i find the docs for thsi stuff
[19:15:07] <mrryanjohnston> I tryied ust searching for test()
[19:15:12] <mrryanjohnston> but came up empty handed
[19:15:30] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[19:15:51] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: thanks very much
[19:26:38] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: I think test won't work since that only returns a true or false
[19:27:35] <Eviltwin> That's how removeClass works
[19:27:51] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: doesn't it look for a string of classes to remove?
[19:27:54] <mrryanjohnston> rather than a true/false
[19:28:19] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I misread
[19:32:45] <Eviltwin> mrryanjohnston: http://jsfiddle.net/dLY6T/
[19:33:23] <dannyprose> Any good ideas/plugins for preloading CSS background images with jQuery 1.7.1?
[19:33:49] <dannyprose> None of the plugins I have tried have worked, but they are all pretty old, so I wasn't expecting to.
[19:34:44] <cpgo> is there a selector to find a checkbox with a specific value - or does this need to be done with a loop
[19:35:28] <Eviltwin> cpgo: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[19:36:35] <cpgo> thanks
[19:45:11] <jaapbadlands> how would I go about selecting $('header nav ul li') but not selecting $('header nav ul li ul li') ?? Can I do this with one expression?
[19:47:02] <ajpiano> jaapbadlands: $("head nav>ul>li")
[19:51:54] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: oh sheesh, thanks man. I wouldn't have gotten that.
[19:52:55] <Eviltwin> mrryanjohnston: Yeah, I pride myself on churning out blocks like that
[19:53:01] <Eviltwin> Relatively quickly
[19:53:41] <systemfault> I'm looking at the authoring article on the website, is there a real-world usage example of that pattern?
[19:53:51] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Which pattern?
[19:54:00] <Eviltwin> The widget one?
[19:54:23] <systemfault> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring That one.
[19:54:32] <Eviltwin> The last one?
[19:54:37] <systemfault> Yeah.
[19:54:49] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: You know off hand?
[19:55:08] <Eviltwin> Most anything that involved I ususally see done as a UI widget
[19:55:20] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Internally it's how UI widget works
[19:55:26] <Eviltwin> But there's a lot going on there
[19:55:48] <systemfault> Seems that this patterns makes it difficult to create "member functions" because the this must always be apply()'ed or call()'ed
[19:56:10] <Eviltwin> That's part of what's called the "bridge" in the UI widgets
[19:56:23] <Eviltwin> The problem is that $()'s track DOM elements
[19:56:38] <ajpiano> https://github.com/malsup/cycle/blob/master/jquery.cycle.all.js
[19:57:18] <Eviltwin> And if you want to maintain chainability
[19:57:40] <Eviltwin> $("foo").parent().myplugin().find("bar") etc.
[19:57:56] <Eviltwin> You can't have myplugin() return an object
[19:58:07] <Eviltwin> And unless you want to be able to do more than just set it up
[19:58:18] <Eviltwin> You need some way to run multiple different functions
[19:58:22] <Eviltwin> (At least create and destroy)
[19:58:25] <systemfault> Eviltwin: I get it but if you look at the link ajpiano pasted.. see how awfully big are the functions :(
[19:58:44] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Hence why I highly suggest you look at UI widget
[19:58:56] <Eviltwin> It makes things a lot simpler
[20:01:02] <Eviltwin> systemfault: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js
[20:01:46] <Eviltwin> systemfault: And also look at the widget factory thing I linked earlier
[20:01:52] <systemfault> I will :)
[20:02:38] <jaapbadlands> ajpiano, thank you
[20:03:57] <Eviltwin> I think I'm going to write a classes plugin
[20:04:05] <Eviltwin> For manipulating classes on elements
[20:04:43] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: alright, so for that jfiddle, it doesn't quite work. I took out the ^ in the regex and it just blasted away all of the classes
[20:05:12] <systemfault> Eviltwin: What would that do that add/removeClass doesn't?
[20:05:54] <mrryanjohnston> hm, but it did work for you
[20:05:59] <mrryanjohnston> in the jsfiddle.
[20:06:02] <Eviltwin> systemfault: There are a number of use cases where people (ab)use classes as tags
[20:06:04] <mrryanjohnston> interestiing. I'll investigate
[20:06:08] <Eviltwin> And want to access and operate on them as an array
[20:06:18] <systemfault> Hmm, I don't like jQueryUI but the widget factory indeed looks nice.
[20:06:33] <Eviltwin> systemfault: My thoughts exactly
[20:06:51] <Eviltwin> systemfault: So basically like what mrryanjohnston's doing right now
[20:07:01] <Eviltwin> Be able to remove all the classes that match a regex or other filter
[20:07:29] <systemfault> Ah, I see, not a bad idea but it's of very limited use imho
[20:08:31] <Eviltwin> That's kind of what plugins are all about :P
[20:08:40] <Eviltwin> Something that doesn't belong in jQuery
[20:08:47] <Eviltwin> But some people would find particularly useful
[20:08:50] <systemfault> :)
[20:08:52] <Eviltwin> Anyway, my battery's dead
[20:08:55] <Eviltwin> So I'll TTYL
[20:09:00] <systemfault> Later.
[20:09:00] <Eviltwin> Good luck to all
[20:09:05] <systemfault> And thanks :)
[20:09:24] <pythonirc1011>  If I have this included -- <script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/jquery-1.4.4.js"></script> -- how do i call jquery.ajax(url) or any other jquery function? -- I tried : alert("http://mydomain.com/"+ $.URLEncode(document.forms["emailform"]["email"].value)); -- didnt work
[20:14:25] <gloomer> pythonirc put your code on jfiddle
[20:14:30] <gloomer> you will probably fix it as you post it :)
[20:14:59] <pythonirc1011> hey gloomer. thanks for the help yesterday.
[20:15:28] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: here is my problem. I've an email in a JS function. I want to send it to the server
[20:15:46] <pythonirc1011> I can send it using a url : mydomain.com/a@b.c - or using json
[20:15:51] <gloomer> ok
[20:16:02] <pythonirc1011> is one preferable than the other?
[20:16:16] <gloomer> depends what the handler is
[20:16:29] <gloomer> mvc?php?
[20:16:34] <pythonirc1011> flask/wsgi + python on the backed...it supports both
[20:19:51] <pythonirc1011> this looks ugly : http://pbin.compgeom.com/show/15/
[20:19:55] <pythonirc1011> is there a way to simplify it?
[20:23:48] <gloomer> doesnt look bad to me
[20:24:02] <gloomer> lol should see my ajax requests
[20:25:30] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: can i use $SCRIPT_ROOT = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"; -- to set  a variable and then use $.getJSON($SCRIPT_ROOT + '/_add_numbers', ... ?
[20:25:47] <pythonirc1011> or string variables have some other syntax?
[20:25:56] <pythonirc1011> sorry, never coded in js...
[20:27:49] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: does this look any good: http://pbin.compgeom.com/show/16/ ?
[20:29:02] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: is there a reason why jquery writers write the callback in the function call instead of writing it in a separate function and setting it as callback?
[20:30:37] <gloomer> probaby because .CallBack wasnt added tell 1.7
[20:31:15] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: its cleaner to write it this way, right? http://pbin.compgeom.com/show/16/
[20:31:36] <pythonirc1011> also, how do i find if the ajax failed?
[20:31:45] <systemfault> Check your debugger.
[20:31:45] <pythonirc1011> the code seems to post the correct access
[20:32:01] <systemfault> (The Chrome dev tools)
[20:32:20] <pythonirc1011> I mean programmatically -- jQuery.getJSON( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)] ) -- success i use ? failure?
[20:32:22] <bot-t> pythonirc1011, #8188 (jQuery .animate() causes failure in <=IE8 on z-index property ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8188
[20:34:55] <gloomer> you have sucess so its easy to catch failure
[20:35:15] <systemfault> !ajax
[20:35:44] <systemfault> Arf.. I don't know that bot... but at this point, the documentation is your best friend.
[20:37:20] <pythonirc1011> gloomer: how? success is called async.
[20:37:59] <systemfault> You take a look at the doc to see if you can set an error handler?
[20:39:51] <gloomer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740218/error-handling-in-getjson-calls
[20:39:58] <pythonirc1011> http://pbin.compgeom.com/show/17/ -- I am currently able to send a json dictionary with key = email using this call. How do i set the key =" email" and add the email address to the key?
[20:43:56] <pythonirc1011> Got it data : { email: string }
[20:49:19] <necromancer> pythonirc1011: there are 4 kinds of variables in javascript: numbers, "strings", [arrays] and {objects}
[20:57:50] <[knight01]> do you guys think 960-grid sysetm or Masonry?
[21:00:06] <systemfault> Never needed them...
[21:04:33] <Spike_Manana> Hi, I'm new to JS and jQuery. Is it possible to have a jQuery script in <body> when jQuery is defined only before </body>?
[21:04:53] <alFReD-NSH> put it in the header!
[21:06:04] <systemfault> Spike_Manana: No.. jquery can be in the body... no script using it must be included before.
[21:06:07] <Spike_Manana> yeah, I know that it will work that way. But maybe there is a way to do it the way I described?
[21:07:15] <Spike_Manana> so there is no function something like this: Read the whole page, define jQery, after init jQery scripts above
[21:07:36] <systemfault> Nope because it doesn't make sense.
[21:08:03] <systemfault> Optimally, all the script should be at the bottom of the body...
[21:08:17] <systemfault> You include jquery.. then your other scripts
[21:08:54] <Spike_Manana> so when people put their jquery before </body> they are sure that no jquery script will be present above?
[21:09:09] <systemfault> Spike_Manana: There's no reason to be..
[21:10:56] <Spike_Manana> OK, Thank you!
[21:11:21] <systemfault> :)
[21:15:43] <alFReD-NSH> guys I have this problem : http://pastebin.com/qGPqvWra
[21:16:06] <alFReD-NSH> $input is a collection of input elements that has no children
[21:16:22] <alFReD-NSH> and I want to select the ones with the readonly attribute
[21:16:28] <alFReD-NSH> and the ones don't have it
[21:16:49] <alFReD-NSH> but when use $input.find('[readonly]') i get empty array
[21:17:06] <alFReD-NSH> same goes for $input.find('not([readonly])')
[21:17:11] <systemfault> alFReD-NSH: .find will try to find descendants I think
[21:17:28] <alFReD-NSH> yes, I think that's the problem, any work around?
[21:17:42] <systemfault> You might want .filter('[readonly]');
[21:17:44] <systemfault> And
[21:17:50] <systemfault> You might want .filter(':not([readonly])');
[21:18:10] <alFReD-NSH> trying it, thanks :D
[21:38:05] <sente> how can i simulate clicking on links within youtube's messaging area? http://c.sente.cc/JEkp/youtube_messages.png
[21:39:03] <sente> isn't there some sort of $(<selector>).click() which should do the trick?
[21:40:09] <sente> i have to be missing something
[21:44:28] <Eviltwin> The important thing to remember is that those trigger events within jQuery
[21:44:52] <Eviltwin> And unless they've bound with jQuery, they won't get triggered
[21:46:43] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/SCGPP/
[21:47:53] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/SCGPP/1/
[21:48:01] <sente> http://bpaste.net/show/21102/ works
[21:48:19] <Eviltwin> I have no doubt
[21:48:34] <Eviltwin> But that's because you're running the JavaScript function they specified
[21:48:39] <sente> yeah, i know
[21:48:43] <sente> not ideal
[21:49:01] <Eviltwin> You might be able to do $('a[id^=tab-inbox]')[0].onmousedown();
[21:49:10] <Eviltwin> But I don't know if that works or what browsers support it
[21:49:18] <Eviltwin> And it only works for the ones that have the onmousedown set
[21:49:25] <Eviltwin> Not .attachEvent or .addEventListener etc.
[21:49:26] <sente> ah hah, that works
[21:49:30] <sente> your $('a[id^=tab-inbox]')[0].onmousedown();
[21:49:35] <sente> in chrome anyways
[21:49:39] <Eviltwin> I'm not all that surprised
[21:49:42] <Eviltwin> I think I've had to do that before
[21:51:01] <sente> is there a way to use jquery selectors to get only the first element? neither :first nor .first() make it so the the [0] isn't required after the selector
[21:51:13] <sente> Eviltwin: thank you for your help
[21:51:25] <Eviltwin> No problem
[21:51:46] <Eviltwin> You can avoid the []'s but at some level []'s are going to be used
[21:51:51] <Eviltwin> $('a[id^=tab-inbox]').get(0)
[21:52:02] <Eviltwin> But that's basically doing [0] inside
[21:52:31] <liam> any ideas how to implement this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5397184/select-all-items-in-asp-net-checkboxlist but with multiple checkboxlists?
[21:52:59] <sente> Eviltwin: I see
[21:53:04] <Eviltwin> liam: Did you see what they wrote?
[21:53:11] <Eviltwin> In the most highly voted answer
[21:54:43] <liam> Eviltwin: Yes I have tried it. The problem is that it doesn't work if there are multiple lists on the one page. It only picks up the first checkbox in the first list. But I have multiple lists. So I want to use it for the first checkbox in each list. Any ideas?
[21:55:23] <liam> and the lists are dynamically added so the easiest way will be to select them using the class, if possible.
[21:57:20] <gloomer> liam put some code on jsfiddle
[21:57:38] <gloomer> and we will fiddle with it :)
[21:58:06] <liam> ok 1 sec
[21:59:27] <Demp> I have an ajax() function that implements the success method. I want to be able to print the data that is received from the server as soon as it comes, and not wait for it to fully complete. is there a way to do that?
[22:00:04] <Eviltwin> liam: http://jsfiddle.net/DpUwp/
[22:00:23] <Eviltwin> liam: You can obviously fiddle with the selectors
[22:00:31] <Eviltwin> But at least that's the idea of what you want
[22:00:36] <Eviltwin> Uses the 1.7+ .on syntax
[22:00:38] <Eviltwin> see ?.oin
[22:00:40] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Essential jQuery Plugin Patterns - Smashing Coding - http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[22:00:41] <Eviltwin> Err
[22:00:43] <Eviltwin> see ?.on
[22:00:43] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:00:58] <Eviltwin> If you're using before 1.7, see ?.delegate instead
[22:00:59] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:01:04] <Eviltwin> Which has the same syntax just in a different order
[22:01:31] <Eviltwin> All of the functions I use (except the setTimeout which is native JavaScript) are thoroughly documented on api.jquery.com
[22:03:53] <liam> Eviltwin: Ok thanks
[22:04:38] <Eviltwin> Note that you only need to do the binding once there
[22:04:40] <Eviltwin> Only one .on
[22:04:52] <Eviltwin> And all future checklists of that form have the check all property
[22:07:17] <liam> yes thanks
[22:07:39] <sorahn> hey guys can is there something for .next that allows it to find different tags?
[22:08:09] <Eviltwin> sorahn?
[22:08:15] <Eviltwin> Explain further
[22:08:17] <sorahn> should $('a').next('div') work?
[22:08:31] <Eviltwin> It will give you the next sibling of a that is a div
[22:08:41] <sorahn> hmm, then i broke something.
[22:08:45] * sorahn aways!
[22:08:49] <Eviltwin> i.e. the first sibling after that a that is a div
[22:08:56] <sorahn> yea, thats what i thought
[22:09:24] <ajpiano> no it won't
[22:09:26] <ajpiano> ?next2
[22:09:40] <ajpiano> it gives you the next sibling, IF it is a div
[22:09:46] <ajpiano> need to use .nextAll()
[22:10:05] <bot-t> .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[22:10:18] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: So not the first sibling after that A that is a DIV?
[22:10:27] <ajpiano> nope
[22:10:38] <Eviltwin> So it's just .next().filter(...) basically?
[22:10:44] <ajpiano> yep
[22:10:51] <Eviltwin> Goes to show how often I use it
[22:11:13] <sorahn> ok so, if the first sibling IS a div...
[22:11:17] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[22:11:19] <sorahn> then it should be fine right?
[22:11:28] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:12:08] <pythonirc1011> for some reason -- for all browsers --  $.ajax({ url: $SCRIPT_ROOT + "/_add_email",dataType: 'json',  data: { email : (document.forms["emailform"]["email"].value) },  success: added_email }); -- this works the first time and posts "GET //_add_email?email=giz%40gmail.com..." but the next time it posts GET /?email=giz@gmail.com&x=36&y=25 H... -- any ideas what is going on?
[22:13:11] <pythonirc1011> why is it posting it twice...does getJSON actually post it twice?
[22:14:58] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Is there a built-in function to do what I thought .next did?
[22:15:07] <ajpiano> nope
[22:15:11] <Eviltwin> Huh
[22:15:21] <ajpiano> .nextAll("div:first")
[22:15:33] <Eviltwin> What if the target is multiple items
[22:15:52] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/RkkCS/1/
[22:16:54] <Eviltwin> Seems like you have to break out a .map to do this
[22:17:51] <sorahn> hey Eviltwin so, back to next.  if i break, and i use $('a').next().contents() I'm seeing div#contets instead of the sibling of that a tag.
[22:18:07] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/RkkCS/3/
[22:18:11] <Eviltwin> Maybe that can be done better
[22:18:18] <Eviltwin> But that's the best that's coming to my mind
[22:18:51] <pythonirc1011> gkatsev: Here is my problem. On firefox sometimes my ajax call works, but sometimes it doenst. Depends on what it posts to the server : http://pbin.compgeom.com/show/18/
[22:19:03] <Eviltwin> sorahn: Sorry, I gotta head out
[22:19:07] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: .nextIntil("div").next() :p
[22:19:07] <Eviltwin> Work in the morning
[22:19:14] <Eviltwin> Heh
[22:19:37] <Eviltwin> Still doesn't work :P
[22:20:03] <Whirl3d> Is there a way to determine if an element has a custom method bound to it?
[22:20:16] <pythonirc1011> for some reason instead of posting "GET /_add_email?email=giz%40gmail.com..." it posts this GET /?email=giz@gmail.com&x=36&y=25 H... -- any ideas what is going on?
[22:20:19] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What kind of custom method?
[22:20:26] <Eviltwin> Do you mean an event listener?
[22:21:15] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: try creating the url manually?
[22:21:51] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: as in, dont use data but in url add ?email=... and see if it works all the time then
[22:22:06] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I mean like $(el).bind("somefunc", function () {console.log("somefunc")}); how do I know if somefunc has been bound to $(el)
[22:22:25] <Whirl3d> try $.trigger ?
[22:23:05] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: A) That's called an event listener
[22:23:21] <Eviltwin> B) Do you mean you as a debugger or you as in JavaScript code you're writing?
[22:24:09] <pythonirc1011> gkatsev: is there a problem with @? do i need a urlencode?
[22:24:21] <Eviltwin> Is your goal to in your browser see if something has been bound to it
[22:24:29] <Eviltwin> Or is your goal to write code that will be able to detect that
[22:24:37] <tagaholic> whats the best way to incorporate jquery into wordpress?
[22:24:39] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: yeah, you probably want to encode it
[22:25:16] <pythonirc1011> but if i'm doing ajax, am i not just passing the data as json?
[22:25:28] <mrryanjohnston> Eviltwin: my issue was the templating engine was escaping the back slash on the \s
[22:25:36] <mrryanjohnston> so it was doing a regex for s
[22:25:55] <mrryanjohnston> just lettin' you know that the code definitely worked :)
[22:25:58] <pythonirc1011> gkatsev: for some reason, i dont even think its being posted by the ajax call
[22:26:02] <pythonirc1011> maybe the form posts it?
[22:26:19] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: the form is posting it
[22:26:28] <gkatsev> and so is your ajax call
[22:26:28] <pythonirc1011> GET /?email=myemail%40domain.com&x=75&y=26 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[22:26:36] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I know you have to work and I appreciate your help. I'll go back to the docs for delegate and on...I'm sure ill find it. I was hoping it was a simple thing like event.listeners.=array of bound listeners...
[22:26:40] <pythonirc1011> oh both of them are ...
[22:26:44] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: you want to "return false" not "return False"
[22:26:45] <pythonirc1011> how do i stop the form to post
[22:26:50] <pythonirc1011> ah ok! :(
[22:26:51] <pythonirc1011> thanks
[22:27:00] <gkatsev> you didn't get errors in your console?
[22:27:26] <stanman246> hi in here. I've been assigned a task to rewrite a complete internal site, so win7 ie9 users can use it. How's jquery's (in particular jqueryui's) support for M$'s IE9 at the moment?
[22:27:39] <gkatsev> good
[22:27:50] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: If it was bound by jQuery: $("#element").data("events")
[22:28:04] <stanman246> gkatsev, was that "good" for me?
[22:28:13] <Eviltwin> If it was bound by something else, your browser debug tools can tell you
[22:28:17] <Whirl3d> Hooray! That's what I needed. Thanks a lot.
[22:28:24] <Eviltwin> But you can't really do anything to them in JavaScript
[22:28:34] <Eviltwin> Like .addEventListener bindings won't show up there
[22:28:38] <gkatsev> stanman246: yes, jquery supports ie9 just fine. In fact, you're lucky. You wont really have to wrestle with IE that much compared to something like ie6
[22:29:32] <Whirl3d> I was just coming up with multiple binds to the same listener and was hoping there was a way to check before rebinding..
[22:29:35] <stanman246> gkatsev, ahh great! I use firefox myself on ubuntu. Is Safari's running jquery fine as well?
[22:29:45] <gkatsev> stanman246: yeah
[22:30:03] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It's not really a good practice to have JavaScript code poking at that
[22:30:09] <stanman246> gkatsev, superb! This will make my life easy again ;-)
[22:30:15] <Eviltwin> Think of it as private member data
[22:30:17] <liam__> Eviltwin: here is what I am dealing with http://jsfiddle.net/DpUwp/2/ . I can't add a class to the first checkbox only it's <span> tag. Any ideas?
[22:30:35] <Eviltwin> liam__: That's not how you add a class
[22:30:57] <gkatsev> stanman246: I'm sure there will be quirks between the browsers but it's nothing like having to support IE6. Heck, even IE8 has problems. IE9 is much better. IE10 will be even more so
[22:31:26] <pythonirc1011> gkatsev: thanks once again
[22:31:33] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: np. did it fix it?
[22:31:36] <pythonirc1011> yes
[22:31:54] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: also, I would avoid putting js in strings in the html like that.
[22:32:07] <pythonirc1011> i'll pull it out to a js soon
[22:32:22] <Eviltwin> liam__: http://jsfiddle.net/DpUwp/4/
[22:32:28] <stanman246> gkatsev, well the site isn't about all the fancy look and feel, just needs to be functional
[22:32:31] <gkatsev> pythonirc1011: ok. It just makes it cleaner
[22:32:33] <Whirl3d> way down in the comments for .bind...karl swedberg suggests unbinding before binding to avoid my issue. that'll work. Thanks for the advice Eviltwin
[22:32:41] <stanman246> gkatsev, thanks!
[22:32:56] <gkatsev> stanman246: but it still needs to look. and preferably good. :P
[22:33:10] <stanman246> gkatsev, aye!
[22:33:13] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: If you some how end up binding too much, you're likely trying to account for dynamically-added elements
[22:33:14] <mrryanjohnston> gkatsev: well said
[22:33:23] <Eviltwin> At which point I strongly suggest looking at delegate
[22:33:27] <Eviltwin> Anyway, do actually have to leave now
[22:33:30] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[22:33:31] <liam__> Evilttwin: awesome. Thank you.
[22:33:51] <gkatsev> mrryanjohnston: thanks :)
[22:34:03] <pythonirc1011> gkatsev: any good recommendations for json tidying?
[22:34:15] <pythonirc1011> sorry JS / jquery tidying
[22:34:24] <gkatsev> jsbeautifier
[22:34:37] <gkatsev> .org
[22:36:21] <pythonirc1011> thanks
[22:37:05] <gkatsev> np
[22:41:25] <Whirl3d> does anybody have a link to a form handling script that uses .on effectively to handle dynamically added form fields...one that I could pick apart to understand a little better?
[22:43:25] <diminoten> not nice Paradox
[22:43:31] <diminoten> oops
[22:48:38] <Rndnick> hi
[22:49:06] <Rndnick> im looking for a jquery that will show a part of a table by looking at a inputbox text
[22:49:54] <Rndnick> 797 in here, no-one answering ?
[22:53:21] * sente fails at parsing that
[22:53:35] <Rndnick> parsing what
[22:53:51] <sente> what you're looking for
[22:56:40] <Rndnick> jquery that pages a table as a result
[22:57:09] <Rndnick> is it auto-suggest ?
[22:58:02] <sente> you want something like http://sente.cc/stu/auto_complete.html ?
[22:58:26] <sente> or do you want filter table rows?
[22:58:45] <Rndnick> i want it to list more complex result, not just a list of words
[22:59:45] <sente> there are a bunch of plugins for that, i forget which one's ive used / which ones are better than others
[22:59:58] <sente> what in particular do you want
[23:00:22] <Rndnick> more then just words
[23:00:27] <Rndnick> more like a table
[23:01:21] <sente> you're not looking for auto-complete functionality, but rather you want to filter a dataset?
[23:01:36] <sente> http://datatables.net/
[23:01:38] <sente> ?
[23:01:52] <Rndnick> yes
[23:02:13] <Rndnick> is that a jquery plugin ?
[23:02:43] <Rndnick> ah
[23:02:44] <sente> DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library...
[23:02:48] <Rndnick> see it at top of page :P
[23:02:53] <sente> first sentence man ;)
[23:02:57] <Rndnick> can i also put images in that ?
[23:03:12] <Rndnick> in the table i mean
[23:04:56] <sente> To display an image all you need to do is use the html <img> tag :-). All content in DataTables will be interpreted as HTML.
[23:04:58] <sente> from http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/61/display-images-in-datatables-1.4/p1
[23:06:31] <Rndnick> thanks
[23:06:36] <Rndnick> how is this type of search filtering called ?
[23:06:42] <Rndnick> just filtering ?
[23:06:54] <sente> I believe so
[23:13:51] <Rndnick> anone using sharepoint ?
[23:14:09] <Rndnick> sente, you ?
[23:14:22] <sente> nope
[23:14:33] <sente> it rings a bell but I don't know offhand what sharepoint is
[23:29:01] <disco1> hey, can anybody recommend a basic image viewer with the following features: show a set of images across the page (think product browsing), click to go to url for each image, ability to scroll left and right if images don't fit on screen, and optionally, some sort of zoom or increase image size for the image in the middle reducing in size to left and right
[23:31:28] <sente> sounds hardly basic
[23:31:50] <sente> also sounds full of everything I hate
[23:32:40] * sente is very web 1.0 when it comes to galleries
[23:46:38] <gf3> disco1: http://finegoodsmarket.com/view/
[23:51:11] <disco1> gf3: thanks for that but probably need something more like this rojoouterwear.tomatosource.com.au/jackets/womens-jackets/one-and-only-caribbean-blue
[23:51:25] <disco1> gf3: i
[23:51:33] <gf3> rude
[23:51:44] <disco1> gf3: I've found some that could be cool, lemme know if u want a list
[23:53:36] <zmbmartin> I am using jquery sortable right now. If I $("ul.photo_list").sortable('toArray') I get an array of ids, but in my update ajax post data: $("ul.photo_list").sortable('toArray') the server sees a bunch of undefineds?
[23:53:45] <zmbmartin> Any ideas what I can look for?
[23:54:26] <Whirl3d> ?serialize@zmbmartin
[23:54:26] <bot-t> zmbmartin, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[23:54:49] <Whirl3d> or maybe .param?
[23:55:05] <zmbmartin> Whirl3d: but serialize is sending my photos with odd names
[23:56:24] <zmbmartin> Whirl3d: I tried serialize but then I the server I am getting stuff like adfs234iojndsf.jpg, adsfadsf2390324.jpg
[23:56:25] <Whirl3d> zmbmartin, like what?
[23:56:42] <zmbmartin> Those are not my ids at all.
[23:56:53] <Whirl3d> those look like filenames
[23:58:39] <MoTiOnXml> what is the right name for plugins that shows helper text over input fields, until the user e.g. enters a value?
[23:58:44] <MoTiOnXml> mask?
[23:59:01] <Whirl3d> placeholder
[23:59:08] <MoTiOnXml> ah
[23:59:12] <MoTiOnXml> ofcourse :)
[23:59:14] <MoTiOnXml> any suggestions?
[23:59:29] <MoTiOnXml> i'm looking for a placeholder-plugin that allows me to use e.g the title-attr for temp messages
[23:59:31] <Whirl3d> it's an attribute in HTML5
[23:59:54] <Whirl3d> <input type='text' placeholder='someinfo'/>
