[00:03:07] <k1ng> jqury is a mvc right?
[00:03:24] <yamahaalex37> how can it be k1ng
[00:03:25] <ximarin> hi all, html5 introduced the attribte 'valid' for form elements. But if I try to get the value for this by $("#bla").attr("valid") i get an undefined. How do I get the valid-state for in input?
[00:03:41] <k1ng> idk
[00:03:44] <k1ng> just asking
[00:04:39] <yamahaalex37> do you know what jquery and mvc are
[00:04:58] <k1ng> no
[00:05:10] <Cork> k1ng: jquery can be used in mvc, but it can't in any way be mvc
[00:05:16] <ximarin> hmpf, found it, for those who are as stupid as me: $("#bla").is(":valid"); does it...
[00:05:17] <aro> i am trying to write a plugin for our site, how do i run a plugin function without rinning it on an element?
[00:06:03] <aro> when i do: $.pluginFunction(); it says that it is not a function
[00:06:06] <k1ng> JavaScriptMVC AngularJS Backbone KnockoutJS
[00:06:15] <k1ng> any of those are MVC for jquery?
[00:08:03] <yamahaalex37> k1ng, i will trade you my MVC for 3 usb's
[00:09:26] <yamahaalex37> then you can stop searching
[00:09:36] <yamahaalex37> i will paypal the MVC if you email me 3 usb
[00:09:42] <k1ng>  i dont need a mvc
[00:09:46] <aro> anyone know?
[00:09:50] <yamahaalex37> oh
[00:10:01] <k1ng> i just wanted to know if jquery is MVC
[00:10:22] <yamahaalex37> its not, but it can be used in creating a mvc
[00:10:36] <Cork> aro: assign the function to jQuery
[00:10:42] <k1ng> can you explain what is MVC?
[00:10:56] <Cork> Model View Controller
[00:11:23] <k1ng> like data-bind=""
[00:11:27] <k1ng> http://knockoutjs.com/
[00:11:31] <aro> this is my code: http://pastie.org/2942883
[00:11:35] <aro> it is assigned to jquery
[00:11:48] <yamahaalex37> http://www.ericbieller.com/2010/05/20/php-project-planning-for-idiots-mvc-design-pattern/
[00:11:51] <yamahaalex37> for you k1ng
[00:12:18] <aro> mvc = model / view / controller
[00:12:25] <aro> separates application/business/data logic
[00:12:51] <k1ng> hm
[00:13:38] <bloodsport_mazer> does anyone know how to truly solve this Jquery and Lightbox conflict?
[00:13:47] <aro> bloodsport_mazer: whats the problem?
[00:14:21] <aro> how do i write a function to work anonymously i think is what i need to do
[00:14:32] <aro> $.functionname(); not $('element').functionname();
[00:14:37] <bloodsport_mazer> Only one of the scripts is working properly on my web page.. it seems that Jquery slider is not working
[00:14:49] <k1ng> bloodsport_mazer, use colorbox
[00:14:58] <aro> colorbox is cool
[00:15:05] <aro> i like fancybox personally
[00:15:08] <bloodsport_mazer> yea color box is pretty awesome
[00:15:13] <bloodsport_mazer> im new to java script
[00:15:16] <bloodsport_mazer> so this is over my head
[00:15:30] <k1ng> lightbox <<<<<< colorbox
[00:15:44] <bloodsport_mazer> does color box have any conflicts with jquery?
[00:15:53] <k1ng> its a jquery plugin
[00:15:56] <qawsedrf> how do i make an ajax request to say google.com ?
[00:16:05] <k1ng> qawsedrf, you cant
[00:16:23] <k1ng> coss-domain ajax are not allowed by browsers
[00:18:24] <qawsedrf> :(
[00:19:06] <aro> thats not entirely true
[00:20:55] <aro> anyone know how to write a plugin to allow it to be run using $.funcname(); instead of $(elem).funcname();
[00:21:58] <Cork> aro: i've alreayd answered you
[00:24:01] <qawsedrf> jQuery.funcname i guess
[00:24:05] <aro> i said it is bound to jquery
[00:24:22] <aro> when i run it as $(this).funcname(); it works fine
[00:25:21] <aro> oh well
[00:25:24] <aro> ill just do it that way
[00:29:07] <Cork> sigh
[00:29:42] <Cork> aro: (function($) { jQuery.myFunc = function() { alert('hello'); }; })(jQuery)
[00:29:50] <Cork> $.myFunc();
[00:30:38] <bloodsport_mazer> If you have a spare second please pm me if you can help me with the conflict between jquery-1.4.2.min.js and lightbox

[00:39:45] <bloodsport_mazer> drdetroit im about 5 mins from la
[00:44:05] <JesperA> hmm, i can use <img src="cake.jpg" data-anynameiwanthere="realimage" <---- and jQuery can target whatever i choose to use as a name after data-?
[00:44:38] <xeodox> Does anyone know what the comma after the selector means? $("#mydiv", this).html("blah");
[00:45:03] <Cork> xeodox: the object the selector should work on
[00:45:13] <Cork> its the same as $(this).find('#mydiv')
[00:46:16] <shesek> xeodox, makes no sense with an id selector tho, as they should be unique across the page
[00:46:40] <JesperA> maybe he only have 1 per page
[00:46:41] <JesperA> :D
[00:46:56] <bloodsport_mazer> there is about to be a riot real soon
[00:47:08] <qawsedrf> riot?

[00:55:57] <zabka> hi folks. how can i say inside of $, taht i wanna fire an event for a specified class  or for a specified name without repeting the code? can i do it at all?
[00:57:33] <zabka> like $(".zt_update") or $('input[name$="zt_update"]').change (function(){
[00:59:20] <anaron> Hi all
[00:59:59] <anaron> I've got some strange problem with .ajaxStart - it works on few first ajax calls from page, but after that the event is fired at all
[01:00:20] <anaron> Does anyone had similiar issue? I'm using it to give application default preloader
[01:00:49] <anaron> http://jsfiddle.net/4cTqu/ <- the example code
[01:02:17] <ragas>  $('#PopUp').load(url).prepend('Press Esc to close'); the url loads OK, but im having trouble attaching some text to the div where the url loaded.
[01:05:18] <phrearch> hello
[01:05:46] <phrearch> i have a div container with div based options that are selectable. how would a selector look like that is only triggered outside of the container?
[01:15:14] <PupenoW> I'm doing $(blah).prev().before(blah) to move an element up on a list of elements. That works but it's instantaneous. Is there a way to animate the swap?
[01:16:41] <dirkpennings> can I use $.getScript() to load a cross domain JS? (e.g. from a CDN)
[01:20:05] <qawsedrf> what is jsonp?
[01:22:56] <dirkpennings> qawsedrf: http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[01:26:13] <qawsedrf> confusing
[01:31:12] <zabka> how can i access a selector either by name or by class? like  $('input[name$="zt_update"]', '.class').change (function(){  ?
[01:33:53] <larsemil> $('input[name="test", '.class') should do.
[01:34:00] <larsemil> forgot a ]
[01:34:25] <larsemil> the comma should be inside the '' so that its only one string
[01:35:33] <larsemil> zabka: ^^
[01:35:56] <Waseem> hi there, I'm new to this channel but want to know if I should file a bug report regarding issue I'm getting with "wrap" function which doesn't work correctly when I use something like: $("<a>").wrap("<li>").appendTo("body")
[01:35:59] <larsemil> if i remember correctyle sending a second variable into the selector will search for first string in second variables namespace
[01:41:22] <Waseem> If jsFiddle share can help track my issue, here is the URL: http://jsfiddle.net/SSujs/
[01:42:39] <shesek> Waseem, what's the problem exactly?
[01:43:55] <shesek> oh, I see
[01:43:56] <Waseem> Function "wrap" doesn't work as intended.
[01:44:23] <Waseem> is it a known case?
[01:44:27] <shesek> two things: a. You shouldn't have `<li>` that isn't inside a list container (ul / ol)
[01:44:37] <shesek> b. your wrapping element needs to be added to the DOM too
[01:44:52] <Waseem> Ah! b is the case
[01:44:56] <shesek> e.g. $('<a>').wrap($('<p>').appendTo('body'))
[01:45:12] <shesek> otherwise, you wrapping element doesn't really exists in the DOM
[01:45:25] <shesek> but that's easier to write as $('p').append('<a>').appendTo('body')
[01:45:35] <shesek> sorry, $('<p>').append('<a>').appendTo('body')
[01:45:51] <Waseem> but y does wrap function needs the given node in DOM exactly, couldn't it just wrap the given jQuery object instance around?
[01:46:21] <sethuhdiah> any recommendations on jquery mvc framework
[01:46:42] <shesek> sethuhdiah, "jquery mvc framework"?
[01:47:05] <dr0id> mootools
[01:47:18] <dirkpennings> Waseem: http://jsfiddle.net/SSujs/2/
[01:47:34] <Cork> scary jquery events propagates completly different in jqueyr 1.7 compared to earlier version
[01:48:12] <Waseem> @shesek is there any other way around constructing jQuery objects and using wrap function without adding it to DOM first?
[01:48:14] <glimmermann> does anyone know why jquery and js/prototype.js conflict with each other?
[01:48:28] <Cork> ?.noConflict @ glimmermann
[01:48:29] <bot-t> glimmermann, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[01:48:40] <sethuhdiah> someone recommended http://knockoutjs.com/ to me due to its MVC style structure
[01:48:52] <shesek> Waseem, I don't think so. Seems like you can't wrap an element with another element if both of them don't exists in the DOM tree
[01:49:06] <glimmermann> Cork I have a jquery slider & lightbox running and only 1 seems to work properly
[01:49:08] <shesek> Waseem, One of them has to be added to the DOM first. Or you can work with append() instead
[01:49:30] <Waseem> #shesek Thanks for the help. Much appreciated
[01:49:51] <Cork> glimmermann: might be the plugin isn't capsulated correctly and therefor doesn't work with noConflict
[01:49:55] <shesek> Waseem, While I do understand why it happens, IMO it can be worked around in jQuery core... you could try to report that as a bug and see what they say
[01:50:16] <Waseem> sure. I was just about to do that.
[01:50:25] <glimmermann> Cork Should I use a different plugin ... what do you suggest?
[01:50:32] <shesek> or maybe check if someone already reported this, which is quite possible
[01:51:44] <Cork> glimmermann: is it lightbox that failes you?
[01:51:52] <Cork> *fails
[01:52:02] <glimmermann> yes
[01:52:04] <shesek> sethuhdiah, there are many MVC or MVC-like (some other structures works better than MVC in a browser environment, IMO) frameworks out there
[01:52:10] <shesek> sethuhdiah, just see what fits your need
[01:52:18] <Cork> glimmermann: do you have its uncompressed source somewhere?
[01:52:50] <sethuhdiah> np was just looking for some general feedback
[01:52:51] <glimmermann> Cork I dont know what you mean by " uncompressed source "  its in its own folder
[01:53:13] <Cork> glimmermann: a version that isn't mininized, as in not one long unreadable line
[01:53:18] <shesek> glimmermann, if jQuery.noConflict causes it to fail, you probably need to wrap its code with `(function($){` .... `})(jQuery)`
[01:54:36] <shesek> glimmermann, or maybe its your own code that uses the plugin that needs it
[01:54:56] <glimmermann> possibly
[01:55:00] <Cork> shesek: its just check it instead of guessing
[01:55:43] <glimmermann> My knowledge of Javascript is new so its been almost like running in circle.  I will have to try a new technique
[01:56:07] <glimmermann> possibly my version of lightbox is outdated?
[01:56:18] <shesek> ... or try to learn JavaScript properly before trying to write code with it?
[01:56:24] <Cork> glimmermann: what version of lightbox are you using?
[01:56:33] <glimmermann> 2.0
[01:56:48] <glimmermann> shesek what do you think im doing lol?
[01:57:19] <martin-g> hi.  recently Dave Methvin posted an example of how to handle hoverintent event with jQuery 1.7 in jsfiddle. Unfortunately I cannot find it with google. Is there a way to list all examples by jsfiddle user ?
[01:57:28] <martin-g> like in gist.github.com
[01:57:32] <Cork> glimmermann: you mean http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2 ?
[01:57:40] <shesek> glimmermann, sorry if I'm wrong, but from the looks of it it looks like you're trying to hack something together for production before properly understand JavaScript/jQuery
[01:57:49] <glimmermann> shesek correct!
[01:58:02] <shesek> * understanding
[01:58:39] <WebDragon> just a note in case someone here has access to /topic:  someone needs to update the /topic to reflect 1.7.1 jquery
[01:59:00] <Cork> glimmermann: that one is using scriptaculus, and as long as your code completly un assignes all the $ variables back to prototype and scriptaculous is should work fine
[01:59:40] <WebDragon> Cork: why not just use var $jQ = jQuery.noConflict(); $jQ( function () { //code here// });
[02:00:03] <Cork> WebDragon: that IS reassigned $ back to prototype :)
[02:00:50] <WebDragon> yeah but I explained more clearly what you do in jQuery in order to achieve that ;)
[02:01:26] <Cork> WebDragon: already linked to noConflict a bit up
[02:01:49] <WebDragon> ah, I missed it )
[02:02:00] * WebDragon kick-starts the bottomless coffeepot and waits for the multiple *peRk*GaSmS to start... 
[02:02:05] * WebDragon needs to wake up
[02:02:14] <WebDragon> long day of development ahead
[02:02:34] <glimmermann> Cork since that script is using " scriptaculous " I shouldn't have to write any additional code?
[02:02:38] <WebDragon> thankfully SHORTENED by a day and a half of potential work that I completely short-circuited a way around by using jquery
[02:02:45] <WebDragon> YEEHAW
[02:02:56] <GuidoBouman> Ola
[02:03:01] <GuidoBouman> I have the weirdest bug.
[02:03:08] <GuidoBouman> http://jsfiddle.net/xx8SR/4/
[02:03:27] <WebDragon> you have no idea how much brain-pain jquery saved me having to induce in both myself (coding some other thing I'd originally had planned) and in the client
[02:03:37] <WebDragon> I found a way around the whole problem that even makes it easier on the client too
[02:03:56] * WebDragon needs to donate some beer to the jquery team
[02:04:23] <GuidoBouman> When sliding down it slides to a size bigger than the original box, and when done animating snaps to the correct size..
[02:04:45] <GuidoBouman> I assumed the slide margin bugs were solved?
[02:04:46] <bl4ckcomb> GuidoBouman, works fine here
[02:05:13] <GuidoBouman> If you click on what's this you'll see it slides down too far, and then snaps back.
[02:05:39] <GuidoBouman> Err, wait a sec.
[02:05:41] <bl4ckcomb> GuidoBouman, works fine here <- that's english, isn't it
[02:05:44] <GuidoBouman> Now it works...
[02:05:54] <GuidoBouman> But In my live code it doesn't...
[02:06:03] <GuidoBouman> bl4ckcomb, Yes I know it's english.
[02:11:18] <PupenoW> Is there a way in jquery to run a query that should return a single element or undefined? to avoid typing this over and over again: $($(blah)[0])
[02:11:24] <PupenoW> Or what am I missing?
[02:14:57] <asdf`> PupenoW, maybe $(foo).first() is what you need
[02:15:53] <GuidoBouman> Okay, so the problem I have is in closed code and somehow can't reproduce it in jsFiddle. jQuery doesn't like me for sliding down a box which contains 2 paragraphs, it slides down to the size of the 2 paragraphs but without their margins. It snaps that extra size on when it's done animating and changes to display: box;
[02:22:35] <rethus> i got an error like: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'css' of null here http://jsfiddle.net/nFQGJ/
[02:22:44] <rethus> anyone can tell me why?
[02:24:35] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/nFQGJ/3/
[02:26:58] <MrBenn> One of the elements your calling the .css on doesn't exist
[02:31:05] <GuidoBouman> Okay, so, here we go again: http://jsfiddle.net/xx8SR/5/
[02:31:34] <GuidoBouman> Scroll all the way down in the html
[02:31:49] <rethus> MrBenn: means i need to set the class="" attribute to #font1 ?
[02:32:00] <GuidoBouman> That's a "What's this?" link next to "outgoing mail server"
[02:32:02] <MrBenn> no
[02:32:13] <GuidoBouman> If you click that It slides down to a bigger size.
[02:32:28] <MrBenn> It means that .css is being called on a 'null' or non-object and therefore te function .css doesn't exist
[02:32:35] <GuidoBouman> The issue is that I slides down to a size that's too big, and snaps back afterwards.
[02:32:58] <richprice316> how do you remove the edit item option in the sidebar cart?
[02:32:59] <rethus>  MrBenn: but the div with #font1 exist. And jquery-js is loaded.
[02:36:13] <ravenzz> rethus take a look at your browser's console
[02:36:46] <GuidoBouman> And the weirdest thing is that in my live code which uses the EXACT same code, it's too small while here it's too big..
[02:37:04] <rethus> ravenzz: there only this message: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'css' of null
[02:37:08] <mgoeppner> GuidoBouman: seems to be working fine for me?
[02:37:43] <ravenzz> so there should be something wrong
[02:37:46] <ravenzz> can you paste your code?
[02:38:20] <GuidoBouman> mgoeppner, WTF, when you click the "What's this" link, it slides down a panel whitout snapping?
[02:38:31] <mgoeppner> rethus: sounds like you are missing the jquery object.
[02:38:33] <rethus> ravenzz: if i type in: $('#font1') i got "null" in console. if i type in $() i got undefined
[02:38:37] <mgoeppner> GuidoBouman: yep.
[02:38:44] <rethus> jes, but i don't understand why
[02:38:45] <GuidoBouman> (When the animation is done it snaps to a smaller size for me)
[02:39:00] <rethus> the file is loaded, i see it in the sourcecode, and the link works, if i click on it
[02:39:01] <GuidoBouman> mgoeppner, Wow? I'm completely baffled by this.
[02:39:06] <mgoeppner> GuidoBouman: let me double check in FF
[02:39:22] <GuidoBouman> http://jsfiddle.net/xx8SR/8/
[02:40:36] <GuidoBouman> I'm on OS X Chrome & Firefox, occuring for me both times
[02:40:53] <mgoeppner> GuidoBouman: wierd, worked fine in firefox (Both links)
[02:41:02] <GuidoBouman> Windows?
[02:41:06] <mgoeppner> I on linux
[02:41:07] <rethus> ravenzz ,mgoeppner: this is the original site: http://www.ilgner-schleif-innovationen.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=177
[02:41:09] <mgoeppner> I'm*
[02:41:21] <GuidoBouman> This can't be a browser bug, right?
[02:41:27] <mgoeppner> i saw the jump in chromium on the link ending in 8 though
[02:41:57] <GuidoBouman> I have that jump in Chrome & Firefox...
[02:42:03] <mgoeppner> But after a refresh I can't reproduce
[02:43:16] <GuidoBouman> Well, F*ck me? I'll just make the animation 200ms, and hope no one notices.
[02:43:23] <GuidoBouman> ...
[02:43:58] <mgoeppner> seems to look fine at 500ms, gonna try a cache clear
[02:44:46] <mgoeppner> http://jsfiddle.net/xx8SR/9/ GuidoBouman
[02:45:40] <mgoeppner> $('#font1') doesn't exist rethus
[02:46:22] <GuidoBouman> I still have the snap? Thinking about reinstalling my macbook? (Getting desperate over here)
[02:46:22] <rethus> mgoeppner: don't understand. If i look in sourcecode, i see it
[02:46:40] <rethus> maybe i have to clean my browsercache
[02:47:38] <mgoeppner> oh
[02:48:09] <rethus> but like i say before... i wonder why $(); in console returns "undefined"
[02:48:17] <ravenzz> ..
[02:48:29] <rethus> like you say before, seems the jquery-opbject is not initiate in right way, but i don't know why
[02:48:42] <ravenzz> (function($) { /* do your stuffs here */ })(jQuery);
[02:49:35] <rethus> ravenzz: you mean me?
[02:49:53] <GuidoBouman> I always use:
[02:50:00] <GuidoBouman> jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[02:50:00] <GuidoBouman> {
[02:50:00] <GuidoBouman> });
[02:50:56] <ravenzz> yes
[02:51:09] <ravenzz> GuidoBouman it is the same
[02:51:23] <mgoeppner> jQuery is active though.
[02:51:59] <mgoeppner> jQuery("#font1").css("background", "red") runs
[02:52:05] <mgoeppner> looks like $ lost focus
[02:52:08] <ravenzz> obvious
[02:52:30] <ravenzz> where is the link? I miss it
[02:52:38] <mgoeppner> And I know why.
[02:52:44] <mgoeppner> you are including jQuery 2x
[02:52:47] <rethus> http://www.ilgner-schleif-innovationen.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=173
[02:52:59] <mgoeppner> in your head and body
[02:53:18] <rethus> i have fix it, but didn't work anyway
[02:53:37] <ravenzz> .
[02:53:49] <ravenzz> you have scripts outside the body/head
[02:54:21] <ravenzz> you are also requiring prototype, do you really need to use both jquery and prototype?
[02:54:52] <mgoeppner> prototype must be using $, leaving it unavailable for jquery
[02:55:11] <rethus> mhh, your right... in the bottom of the page.... i will check to remove this
[02:55:16] <ravenzz> the <style> goes within the head
[02:55:25] <rethus> maybe this is the error
[02:55:50] <mgoeppner> rethus: good catch on the prototype, I suspected it but I missed it down there
[02:55:53] <ravenzz> validate your code, there are silly mistakes that you can fix easily
[02:56:11] <mgoeppner> ravenzz: i meant you sorry :P
[02:56:17] <ravenzz> np
[02:57:08] <rethus> mhh, removing only prototype not work... i cleanup my sourcecode and will see, what happen
[02:57:33] <DotMH> Hi , When you develop a jQuery plugin , and it returns a jQuery object would you unit test all the base jquery functionality ?
[02:57:48] <mgoeppner> rethus: it did too work
[02:57:49] <rethus> realy strange, cause before it works well. only different thing was, that the jquery-script was included from another external page
[02:58:25] <rethus> mgoeppner: you mean, it forks on your browser now?
[02:58:28] <mgoeppner> rethus: removing prototype fixed your jquery errors, try clearing your cache.
[02:59:19] <jayflux> hi all, i need to use nth-child but i see it doesnt work in ie < 9. If i do this jQuery('#technical-information .tableizer-table tr:nth-child(2)').css('background-color', '#F57E20');  Would it work in old ies?
[03:00:01] <ravenzz> rethus  yes it work
[03:00:15] <ravenzz> I mean, no errors occurs
[03:00:42] <rethus> mh, strange, still not work on my browser. i restart my browser
[03:00:53] <mgoeppner> logic error then.
[03:00:54] <ravenzz> what it is supposed to do?
[03:01:15] <rethus> 2 layers in the headers slide-in and show some normal textmessage
[03:01:36] <mgoeppner> rethus: was the external jquery file a different version?
[03:02:32] <GuidoBouman> jayflux, try it out. ;) And yes, should work, jQuery uses a CSS3 selector engine, not really browser dependent.
[03:02:33] <rethus> exactly the same. befor i had a subdomain named framework.xyz.com to centralize all the jquerystuff, but now i copy exactly this jquery to each webspace of the webpages.
[03:02:33] <ricca> hi all
[03:02:34] <ravenzz> rethus there is no text there and its height is 0 (auto)
[03:02:50] <rethus> k, so i've a look at the settings of my cms-module
[03:03:16] <rethus> question: is there a jquery-like alternate for lightbox (cause of my removing prototype)
[03:03:30] <GuidoBouman> fancybox
[03:03:52] <Cork> ?g jquery lightbox 0.5
[03:03:53] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery lightBox plugin - http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[03:03:55] <GuidoBouman> rethus, I like fancybox.
[03:04:13] <rethus> does fancybox use the same "rel="" attribute like lightbox?
[03:04:47] <mgoeppner> rethus: that shouldn't be important.
[03:04:53] <rethus> Cork: link from bot is broken
[03:05:01] <GuidoBouman> rethus, yes it can.
[03:05:15] <Cork> rethus: wfm
[03:05:41] <GuidoBouman> $('a[rel]').fancybox();
[03:05:45] <GuidoBouman> Voila.
[03:05:49] <ricca> can someone tell me why this one http://pastebin.com/Y5tbJ2T1 is correct  and this one http://pastebin.com/7dDE7eis is not correct ?
[03:05:54] <Cork> rethus: http://leandrovieira.com/download/7/
[03:06:38] <imakewebthings> DotMH: no
[03:06:54] <rethus> Cork: whole page seems to be down: http://leandrovieira.com/
[03:07:01] <GuidoBouman> ricca, throw it in fsfiddle.net and try linting it.
[03:07:15] <Cork> ?down http://leandrovieira.com
[03:07:17] <bot-t> Cork, It's just you. - http://leandrovieira.com is up.
[03:07:47] <ravenzz> ricca that code is huge, you should be more specific
[03:07:52] <rethus> k, but fancybox seems to fit my needs
[03:09:14] <rethus> GuidoBouman: thanks for the tipp with fancybox. seems to be realy great plugin, and now i didn't need prototype-library anymore.
[03:09:24] <DotMH> imakewebthings : Great thats what I was hoping some one would say :)
[03:09:35] <ricca> ravenzz, after the ajax request. The new elements that i write after the ajax success must have a "click" function that open a modal window
[03:10:05] <ricca> in the first script they open it, in the second one they not
[03:10:10] <imakewebthings> DotMH: Assuming you aren't modifying those core functions, which of course you wouldn't dare to do... :)
[03:10:29] <ravenzz> ricca are those clicks handled by updateCatalogElementsFunction(element,data) ?
[03:11:42] <anaron> I've got some strange problem with .ajaxStart - it works on few first ajax calls from page, but after that the event is not fired at all
[03:11:46] <anaron> Does anyone had similiar issue? I'm using it to give application default preloader
[03:11:50] <anaron> http://jsfiddle.net/4cTqu/ <- the example code
[03:12:07] <DotMH> imakewebthings : Nope the plugin just returns an Element as a jQuery object , I wouldn't touch the core :) well unless I planned on writting a patch
[03:12:47] <ravenzz> ricca maybe you can assign them a class, lets say .modal and use on() on that
[03:12:50] <phrearch> hm, anyone knows a trick to measure the time spend when doing an x amount of async xhr requests?
[03:13:15] <anaron> @phrearch you can do this with .ajaxStart and .ajaxClose
[03:13:30] <phrearch> anaron: aha thanks
[03:13:46] <anaron> you can use in those methods some variable where you will write time of start
[03:13:56] <anaron> and test the end time in .ajaxClose
[03:14:04] <anaron> so you will have the difference
[03:16:02] <amirite> is there a cross-browser difference in handling keydown vs keypress?
[03:16:03] <ricca> ravenzz, seems that it don't bind the action..but why it does in the first js and not in second one ??
[03:17:32] <anaron> @amirite: You can easly check it (I don't know), just test with some alerts fired when you keydown and hold key in input, and when you keypress it
[03:17:52] <selckin> what's currently the best way to run multiple ie versions?
[03:17:59] <anaron> and test it in different browsers
[03:18:10] <Zogot> IETester
[03:18:12] <Zogot> is what i use
[03:20:00] <ricca> ravenzz, i've Jquery 1.2.6 so .on() is not implemented
[03:20:24] <ravenzz> update it
[03:20:32] <ravenzz> sorry I am busy
[03:20:34] <ravenzz> bbl
[03:21:02] <ricca> i'm working in drupal.. XD
[03:21:28] <anaron> IETester is good, but sometimes it don't work well. The 100% tests would be virtual machines with different ie versions, I read somewhere that Microsoft was giving images where you could run XP with IE6.
[03:22:51] <avidal_> how can i write something like if(ajaxFunction){...
[03:23:28] <anaron> for what purpose avidal?
[03:24:03] <anaron> if some kind of ajax function was fired?
[03:24:11] <avidal_> checking if the ajax success returned 1
[03:24:39] <anaron> but you have this built-in in .ajax method
[03:25:17] <anaron> $.ajax({
[03:25:17] <anaron>   url: "test.html",
[03:25:17] <anaron>   context: document.body,
[03:25:17] <anaron>   success: function(){
[03:25:17] <anaron>     $(this).addClass("done");
[03:25:17] <anaron>   }
[03:25:19] <anaron> });
[03:25:42] <avidal_> can i access it from outside somehow
[03:25:54] <avidal_> and have the success return true/false ?
[03:26:25] <MariusKarthaus> what is the best way to stack an object upon placement? I'm now traversing all siblings and checking their zindexes and putting the new zindex at the max+1
[03:27:56] <anaron> @avidal_ - I don't know, I never had to use it, but it's javascript - you should be able
[03:35:20] <edgardo> hmm.. I have a small project in which I need to move stuff around from point a to b.. trying it out with jsfiddle and can't seem to get it working: http://jsfiddle.net/r9NHY/10/
[03:35:39] <edgardo> can someone guide me into the right direction? I only want the clicked list item to move to list2.. not all of them
[03:38:07] <edgardo> oh.. of course it needs to be $(this).parent() not $(this).children()
[03:38:16] <edgardo> but still.. moves all the <li>s
[03:44:07] <WebDragon> okay: anyone up for a quick fiddle assist?
[03:44:35] <sahbeewah> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/r9NHY/16/
[03:44:43] <xro> Hi, i need some help to use jquery in the right way... I have a page with link on the right and corresponding text on the left... I would like to show only the text to the selected link... I think about hide() and show()... But how to use it really? a code exmple --> http://dpaste.com/663767/  can you help me? thanks
[03:46:46] <edgardo> sahbeewah, whoa that is short :)
[03:47:28] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/Lzg9G/1/embedded/result/  so I have this situation where, when text+images is added to the tinymce editor, it wraps both the text AND the image group in <p> tags, thus creating some extra padding at the bottom of the text block (there's too much space between the border and the end of the last text due to presense of now-empty P tag (since images got positioned to the left)
[03:47:31] <edgardo> thanks
[03:48:07] <WebDragon> what I want to do is something along the lines of .unwrap() but ONLY if the parent of .col-images IS in fact a P not a DIV or SPAN or what-have-you
[03:48:41] <WebDragon> BUT since I'm adding .col-images to the page content on the fly, it's problematic
[03:49:00] <mgoeppner> parent_of_parent > p .col-images ?
[03:50:00] <edgardo> sahbeewah, I need to be able to move it back from #b to #a also.. doesn't seem to work if I make another action with the reversed values ;X
[03:50:57] <WebDragon> see the thing is what I'd hoped to do was ....cycle().end().parents().map( function () { return this.tagName;}).get().join(','); and then test it somehow for a P tag
[03:51:07] <WebDragon> but I can't quite make it work
[03:51:31] <WebDragon> I can't quite figure out how to make it test, and unwrap() a div that's added to the content on the fly
[03:51:48] <WebDragon> tried several ideas and finally scrapped everything and set up this fiddle
[03:51:58] <mgoeppner> do you have an example in a fiddle?
[03:52:03] <mgoeppner> oh
[03:52:05] <mgoeppner> up ther E:P
[03:52:07] * WebDragon grins
[03:52:08] <edgardo> fiddle is nice :)
[03:52:10] <WebDragon> thanks
[03:52:32] <WebDragon> I saved myself a day and a half of work NOT having to write a custom MVC wordpress+magento shortcode function
[03:52:38] <WebDragon> go go gadget jquery
[03:52:49] <WebDragon> now I just need to unwrap the <p> from around the images if it happens to exist
[03:52:57] <WebDragon> tinymce has a tendency to add it
[03:55:04] <sahbeewah> edgardo: that's because if you attach .click on the elements it only does it the ones that are currently in the document
[03:55:15] <sahbeewah> in this case you need to use .on, or .delegate or something
[03:58:39] <sahbeewah> edgardo: http://jsfiddle.net/r9NHY/20/
[03:59:10] <jomofcw> Topic still be outdated ^^ 1.7 => 1.7.1 :x.
[03:59:25] <xro> Hi, i would like to loop all <p id='Pid' style="display:'' "> in a <div id="myID"> and  replace theme by  <p id='Pid' style="display:'none' ">... How to do it?
[04:00:58] <krycek_> is there any technique that renders the content fetched via ajax like a normal browser request would (appeding to the DOM even if it isn't complete)?
[04:01:43] <krycek_> I'm trying to search about it, but had no luck so far
[04:02:13] <edgardo> sahbeewah, thanks. works like a charm! :)
[04:02:20] <donCams> .load works on external files but not on sites though. i think
[04:02:31] <krycek_> it would be like a progressive rendering using ajax
[04:02:41] <donCams> you can request that using .ajax and append the response to an iframe.
[04:03:04] <sahbeewah> xro: $("#myID p").each(function() { $(this).css("display", "none"); });
[04:03:59] <sahbeewah> you can do that?
[04:04:18] <sahbeewah> so if you load ajax response to an iframe it loads it progressively?
[04:04:21] <sahbeewah> that doesn't make sense
[04:04:45] <donCams> didn't read that last part
[04:06:37] <mgoeppner> WebDragon: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Lzg9G/3/
[04:06:49] <mgoeppner> the extra p should be cut out.
[04:06:56] * WebDragon goes to look
[04:08:38] <krycek_> .ajax nor .load does that, both append the content into the DOM just after it's complete
[04:08:46] <krycek_> donCams  sahbeewah
[04:08:47] <mgoeppner> or did I unwrap the wrong p?
[04:09:09] <krycek_> and the iframe suggestion, I don't think it's true
[04:09:19] <krycek_> but I'm going test it
[04:09:51] <WebDragon> mgoeppner: weird, I was under the impression that if I added a static jquery statement that looked for items in the dom, but that were added after document.ready I'd need some other way to do it, because the jquery would run before the items existed
[04:09:55] <WebDragon> apparently I'm wrong
[04:10:02] <WebDragon> seems to work fine :)
[04:10:07] <mgoeppner> Cool beans!
[04:10:13] <WebDragon> I guess I should have tried that first
[04:10:25] <mgoeppner> you could always bind it to an event too
[04:10:34] * WebDragon passes the carafe of DragonCoffeeâ„¢ to mgoeppner 
[04:10:58] <mgoeppner> *takes a hearty swig!
[04:12:52] <mgoeppner> WebDragon: after you add the new elements to the dom, just add a callback with that line (or a similar one)
[04:13:24] <Soothsayer> Hasn't jQuery mobile released?
[04:16:14] <prodn> Hello! Which eventhandler should I use instead of .click() when I just want the "mousedown" and not "mouseup"? like half a click?
[04:17:27] <ablomen> prodn, .mousedown() ?
[04:17:47] <prodn> ablomen ... oO thanks
[04:18:18] <prodn> you know what, I never tried it. Just wasn't listed in the jQuery documentation at the part where they list eventhandlers
[04:18:40] <ablomen> oh weird, it should be
[04:19:14] <prodn> ablomen: if I want to apply more than one eventhandler, like .mousedown and .hover - say to select several items in a list
[04:19:17] <prodn> how can I do this?
[04:19:47] <ablomen> prodn, $("asd").bind("mouseover click focus", function ( ) { });
[04:20:57] <prodn> ablomen: so nothing with mousedown? I will try it, thanks!
[04:21:52] <ablomen> sure you can use mousedown too
[04:21:56] <ablomen> see .bind() in the docs
[04:24:26] <prodn> mousedown does not stop to happen when I release mouse-button?
[04:24:54] <Soothsayer> Anyone tried implementing a carousel in jquery mobile?
[04:25:29] <ablomen> prodn, it should..
[04:30:46] <Soothsayer> Anyone using jQuery mobile? Looking for a configurable carousel plugin that supports prev, next buttons and swipe gesture.
[04:37:24] <anaron>  I've got some strange problem with .ajaxStart - it works on few first ajax calls from page, but after that the event is not fired at all

[04:37:49] <Cristen> Hi everyone, i'm trying to use the $.ajax function to send a form, the problem is that the return false; (or event.preventDefault) doesn"t stop normal submitting, i'm always redirected to the action page ??
[04:42:22] <edgardo> Cristen, remove the action from the form tag?
[04:42:31] <Cristen> I did, same problem
[04:42:50] <edgardo> hmm
[04:42:54] <Cristen> the form is submitted and i'm redirected
[04:43:14] <prodn> .bind('mousedown mouseover', function () {}); triggers the function if I do either mousedown or mouseover. How can I get the function to trigger only if I do them both at the same time?
[04:43:19] <edgardo> make type="submit" -> type="button"
[04:43:22] <edgardo> see if that works
[04:43:26] <Cristen> ok i'll try
[04:43:38] <imakewebthings> prodn: how exactly do you mousedown without being over it?
[04:44:08] <prodn> imakewebthings: mouseover specifies when I enter region moused-down?
[04:44:27] <prodn> does not work with mouseover if I am already over the element, just on entering
[04:45:04] <imakewebthings> prodn: just saying, you can't mousedown without already being over, right?  So don't you just want mousedown?
[04:45:17] <rethus> GuidoBouman: question to fancybox: you say it works also with only rel="" tag for image or link. have you an example for me?
[04:47:27] <imakewebthings> prodn: are you talking about moving?  as in mousemove?
[04:48:07] <Cristen> edgardo, it just doesn"t recognize the .click() event
[04:49:07] <edgardo> hard to say what's wrong without any code to look at :)
[04:49:52] <beasty> le hi all
[04:50:03] <edgardo> try to paste it in www.pastie.org or something .. (remove any sensitive info is there are any)
[04:50:05] <Cristen> I think it's because the script is in a modal box ( boxy)
[04:50:13] <beasty> is there a way to check if a element doesn't have a certain class ?
[04:50:31] <edgardo> you could check if it has by removing it :)
[04:51:05] <beasty> :p
[04:51:19] <Cristen> yep that's the problem
[04:51:34] <beasty> $('.class:not(.class)') ;)
[04:52:40] <Cristen> boxy only retrieves the html data, so my form is inside, but not the script that's why it is submitted$
[04:53:59] <GuidoBouman> rethus, sec
[04:55:23] <GuidoBouman> rethus, $('a.box').fancybox();
[04:55:36] <GuidoBouman> That's for an a with the class box.
[04:55:49] <GuidoBouman> To match for a's which have a rel you can do this:
[04:56:21] <GuidoBouman> $('a[rel]').fancybox();
[04:56:50] <GuidoBouman> All a's with a rel attribute will now open in Fancybox.
[04:59:06] <GreyTrilby> afternoon all - anyone here handy with JQuery UI tabs?
[05:00:29] <AzaToth> anyone knowlegeable regarding jquery form wizard? I've been using form wizard 2.0.1, and is planning to upgrade to 3.0.5, and I wonder what breaking changes I need to do
[05:00:45] <prodn> imakewebthings: yes, sorry. I mean mouseenter
[05:01:44] <prodn> if I make them nested like this though:
[05:01:45] <prodn> $(".object").bind('mousedown', function () { $(".object").bind('mouseover', function () {
[05:02:00] <prodn> why does the inner-most function not stop when I release the mouse-button?
[05:02:11] <imakewebthings> prodn: i think im a bit lost on what you're actually trying to do.  a time when mouseenter and mousedown happen at the same time
[05:02:32] <imakewebthings> prodn: ah ah ok.  because you have to unbind it.  or there is an easier way
[05:03:02] <imakewebthings> prodn: on mousedown, set a flag to true.  and check that that flag is true within your mouseenter
[05:03:11] <imakewebthings> prodn: and on mouseup, set the flag back to false
[05:03:28] <prodn> imakewebthings:
[05:03:29] <prodn> $(".object").bind('mousedown mouseup', function () { $(".object").bind('mouseover', function () {
[05:03:32] <prodn> this solved it
[05:03:34] <prodn> why?
[05:03:48] <imakewebthings> prodn: assuming what you're trying to do is detect when you enter some element with the mouse pressed down???
[05:03:50] <prodn> ah...(?). I didn't listen for mouseup at all first? no?
[05:04:00] <prodn> imakewebthings: yes excatly that
[05:04:08] <prodn> enter with mouse down
[05:04:15] <imakewebthings> prodn: what you wrote there shouldn't work, don't know how it does
[05:04:43] <prodn> I will try the flag thing
[05:04:57] <prodn> with a flag, you mean just a variable? I learned programming in other language
[05:05:18] <imakewebthings> prodn: another way to do it is to define the function not as a closure, something with a name.  then bind it by name on mousedown, and unbind by name on mouseup
[05:05:43] <imakewebthings> prodn: yes, a boolean variable, anything that will come out truthy and falsy
[05:06:01] <prodn> thanks
[05:08:03] <prodn> erm... how do I check if the mouse is down? if (mousedown) ?
[05:08:33] <Cork> prodn: event.button if i remember correctly
[05:11:02] <imakewebthings> prodn: thats what i mean, you define that variable yourself.  set it to true in the mousedown handler, set it to false in the mouseup

[05:17:35] <Beerkeeper> I'm trying to make a dialog with draggables in it that I want to drop in an other dialog. But the draggables stay stuck in the dialog they're in :(
[05:18:16] <rethus> GuidoBouman: seems not to work, wonder why: http://www.ilgner-schleif-innovationen.com/cms/front_content.php?idart=225
[05:19:38] <Beerkeeper> Can anybody help me ? :(
[05:20:22] <Cork> Beerkeeper: you need to set the container of the draggable to boty
[05:20:24] <Cork> *body
[05:20:38] <Beerkeeper> ah thanks, will look at it
[05:20:51] <Beerkeeper> containment you mean?
[05:21:07] <Cork> ya
[05:21:15] <Cork> was just about to correct me :)
[05:22:24] <GuidoBouman> rethus, easing is empty. Just so you know. Not the issue here though.
[05:22:30] <Beerkeeper> hmm Cork, not working :(

[05:25:12] <Cork> Beerkeeper: hmm the element needs to be re positioned in the dom, as if its not it will be cept inside .ui-dialog-content
[05:25:22] <GuidoBouman> rethus, Don't, you should just use: $('a[rel]').fancybox(
[05:25:38] <Cork> Beerkeeper: i could have swarn that was what containment does...
[05:25:51] <Beerkeeper> so far I understand that Cork, and appendTo seems to be the answer, but even that refuses...
[05:25:53] <GuidoBouman> rethus, Because [@rel*='lightbox'] is an invalid expression
[05:26:03] <Beerkeeper> like appendTo: 'body'
[05:26:08] <aaronmcadam> xpath selectors have been deprecated forever
[05:26:15] <aaronmcadam> well, removed actually
[05:26:40] <rethus> GuidoBouman:$('a[rel]').fancybox( even not worked
[05:26:50] <GuidoBouman> rethus, If you want to match anything starting with lightbox do this: $('a[rel*=lightbox]').fancybox();
[05:26:56] <larsemil> how do i debug .load() ??
[05:26:59] <aaronmcadam> that's just going to select any link with a rel attr rethus
[05:27:04] <GuidoBouman> rethus, That's because you're getting an error now.
[05:27:07] <GuidoBouman> Check your console.
[05:27:24] <mgoeppner> Right, I'll be around later, time to hack together something so I can quit my day job #keepdreaming
[05:27:31] <larsemil> GuidoBouman: must be some other way
[05:27:41] <rethus> but i need exactly rel="lightbox" or rel="lightbox[somethingelse]"
[05:28:22] <aaronmcadam> is this CMS output you're dealing with?
[05:28:23] <GuidoBouman> Remove the @ sign on the ones you had.
[05:28:35] <GuidoBouman> $('a[rel*=lightbox]').fancybox();
[05:28:40] <GuidoBouman> That should do the trick.
[05:29:03] <GuidoBouman> How you came up with the @ infront is a mistery to me.
[05:29:32] <rethus> http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[05:29:39] <rethus> but didn't work without the @
[05:30:30] <GuidoBouman> That's not a valid expression.
[05:30:40] <mikunos> hi guys I have some difficulty to show a video in a webpage
[05:30:40] <rethus> now i have remove al parameters inside fancybox. still not work
[05:30:42] <quicksilver> the @ was the old xpath syntax
[05:30:47] <fzzbt> how do i manipulate external html with jquery? eg. myhtml = '<p>foobar</p>'; myhtml.('p').css('color', 'red'); -- obviously that doesnt quite work
[05:30:50] <quicksilver> that was removed from jQuery about 15 years ago.
[05:31:18] <Beerkeeper> Cork: got the answer!!!
[05:31:27] <rethus> maybe cause my rel has this value "lightbox[a]
[05:31:42] <Beerkeeper> appendTo: 'body', helper: 'clone'
[05:31:46] <Beerkeeper> :)
[05:31:56] <Cork> ah
[05:32:20] <Cork> no close but no sigar :)
[05:32:26] <Cork> *close but no
[05:32:34] <Beerkeeper> haha
[05:32:46] <GuidoBouman> rethus, Funy thing is: When I put '$('a[rel*=lightbox]').fancybox();' in my console, it works for fancybox. But then Fancybox gets an error. Which fancybox did you download?
[05:33:17] <rethus> http://fancybox.net/howto
[05:33:25] <GuidoBouman> Looks like you somehow have a bugged version of Fancybox
[05:33:35] <mikunos> I have some difficulty to show a video in a webpage using the flowplayer and jquery selector
[05:34:33] <GuidoBouman> First things first:
[05:34:44] <diverdude> Is there any downside of having multiple document.ready functions in a page?
[05:34:47] <GuidoBouman> rethus, You don't have your jQuery conde in a document wrapper.
[05:35:06] <rethus> what you mean with document wrapper
[05:35:07] <mikunos> when the page has been downloaded and the visitor click on the link where is attached the video link, the link disappears and the flash object is created but hidden, why?!
[05:35:12] <GuidoBouman> diverdude, None, apart from the double statement and double code, so like one MS slowdown?
[05:35:17] <rethus> <!// ?
[05:35:23] <mikunos> any help?
[05:35:37] <diverdude> GuidoBouman: okay...its because i have multiple views
[05:35:37] <GuidoBouman> jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[05:35:37] <GuidoBouman> {
[05:35:37] <GuidoBouman> 	$('a[rel*=lightbox]').fancybox();
[05:35:37] <GuidoBouman> });
[05:35:42] <pvivek> hi i would be very glad if someone can help me out how can i start using timepicker. I mean how to download the required files and what to include and stuff.. I mean i know the contents are there in this link http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/w/list. And i know the usage. But i am not able to get the required css and js stuff. I am a rookie
[05:37:14] <Cork> pvivek: the simplest way to get what you need it to use the themebuilder
[05:37:25] <Cork> s/builder/roller/
[05:37:49] <rethus> GuidoBouman: sorry, i missed this.. now it works like a charm
[05:38:03] <GuidoBouman> =]
[05:38:58] <rethus> GuidoBouman: question... if i only use rel="lightbox" for all iimages on the page. is there a way to flick trough the images
[05:38:58] <Cork> pvivek: but i think the dependency is jquery > jquery-ui code > draggable > resizable > dialog > datapicker
[05:39:07] <mikunos> any suggestion?
[05:39:09] <Cork> s/code/core/
[05:39:50] <GuidoBouman> rethus, left arrow, right arrow, clicking on left side of image, clicking on right side of image, and if you have jquery.scrolling.js installed using the scrollwheel will also flick trough the images.
[05:40:27] <rethus> realy cool. thanks for supporting me
[05:40:42] <pvivek> Cork : Okay. I have downloaded the whole package from the jqueryui.com. But i am not able to find that images/jquery.timepickr.css which he uses in this example http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr
[05:40:51] <GuidoBouman> Fancybox creates galleries automatically when matching more than one element at the same time.
[05:41:07] <rethus> looks much better than lightbox
[05:41:30] <GuidoBouman> I love the margin: 0 options, makes it look really slick.
[05:41:31] <Cork> pvivek: the files are merged, but if you check in them you'll find them separated with copyright comments
[05:42:57] <GuidoBouman> rethus, $('a[rel]').fancybox({padding:0}); try that.
[05:44:44] <pvivek> Cork : Why wouldn't the person who extended the function of datepicker to also make timepicker available provide us with all the required downloads with his download package.  I am just asking, maybe there's a reason behind it. I just wanted to know why
[05:45:36] <Cork> pvivek: cause many use a cdn for the basic jquery and jquery-ui packages
[05:45:42] <Cork> and they don't need it
[05:46:09] <Cork> pvivek: and if jquery and jquery-ui would be included they would have to update the package each time a new version/fix is released
[05:47:05] <pvivek> Cork : Got it :) thanks a lot.
[05:48:06] <Cork> np
[05:52:04] <larsemil> what could cause jQuery().load() gives me blank page, nothing on it what so ever. what could be the reason?
[05:52:25] <larsemil> jQuery('.class').load() more exactly
[05:52:46] <Cork> larsemil: if you check the raw transfer do you see anything from the server?
[05:53:00] <Cork> (in the network tab)
[05:54:14] <Brammm> Hi guys, I'm pretty new to jQuery and encountered someting silly. I add table rows dynamically, with a button. When a row gets added, I execute a function that contains the click event for a button in that new row. However, when I add 3 rows and then click one of the new buttons, the click function gets executed three times
[05:54:19] <Brammm> Is there any way of preventing this?
[05:54:41] <Brammm> working with .live() is not an option, as I also have to apply the .button() function to the new elements
[05:55:00] <martin-g> hi. I have custom custom event that delegates to keyup for IE and to input event for all other browsers: http://pastie.org/2944035. My problem is that the passed event to 'handler' function doesn't have the keyCode property, and 'which' is 0.  testing with FF8
[05:55:02] <Brammm> Or do I have to split it up: apply the button in the original function and use .live() to catch all the cliks?
[05:55:08] <diverdude> like there is a :hover in css, is there also :editing or something like that?
[05:55:26] <Cork> Brammm: your selector prob adds the click events to all the buttons
[05:55:31] <Brammm> diverdude: do you mean :focus and :blur?
[05:55:39] <Brammm> Cork: yeah, I guess so.
[05:55:44] <Cork> Brammm: but ya .live or .delegate is prob what you want see ?.delegate
[05:55:44] <bot-t> Brammm, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:55:50] <diverdude> Brammm: ahhh nice
[05:56:12] <diverdude> Brammm: can i also set text value with css ?
[05:56:22] <Brammm> diverdude: what do you mean?
[05:56:51] <Brammm> Cork: I'll probably go with delegate, will be the prettiest code I guess.
[05:57:03] <Cork> ya
[05:57:06] <Cork> and fastest
[05:57:17] <Cork> adding many event listners slows down the dom
[05:57:23] <Cork> and there by the page
[05:57:27] <Brammm> Oh, good to know
[05:57:45] <diverdude> Brammm: well its just because i am making a textfield called username. And it should be grayed out and have the text username inside until user clicks is. When is clicked it should change background color and remove the text
[05:57:54] <Brammm> Hmm, that made me think: if I execute the click event for all the buttons everytime a new row gets added, I also "reset" them as button, but that's probably not a big problem?
[05:58:04] <diverdude> Brammm: im just wondering if i could do all that in pure css
[05:58:11] <Brammm> diverdude: you can do it with HTML5
[05:58:15] <diverdude> Brammm: or if i need to use javascript
[05:58:25] <diverdude> Brammm: how can it be donw with html5?
[05:58:42] <Brammm> diverdude: placeholder attribute
[05:59:05] <diverdude> Brammm: so how do i use that attribute?
[05:59:27] <Brammm> diverdude: <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Your username..." />
[05:59:35] <Brammm> won't work in all the browsers, but will work in the most recent ones
[05:59:52] <Brammm> you can catch the background colors with css, using the :focus and :blur pseudo selectors
[06:00:15] <rethus> GuidoBouman: thanks, now it looks realy realy great: http://www.ilgner-schleif-innovationen.com/cms/front_content.php?idcat=181
[06:02:05] <diverdude> Brammm: totally wicked att. thx man :)
[06:04:03] <Brammm> diverdude: no problem, good luck.
[06:05:01] <martin-g> here is a jsfiddle that demonstrates my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/gJLCh/7/
[06:05:33] <martin-g> the printed event has no information about the typed key
[06:05:34] <GuidoBouman> rethus, Glad I could help.
[06:06:13] <martin-g> jQuery 1.7.1
[06:07:50] <crab> huh. kendo-ui is very nice to look at, but they require registration blah just to download the minified-only evaluation version.
[06:07:56] <beasty> i'm pondering if i can do a removeClass() with more classes in them
[06:08:03] <beasty> or replace a class
[06:09:16] <crab> why not?
[06:09:31] <beasty> crab: ok how ?
[06:09:52] <crab> beasty: $(x).removeClass('a b c')
[06:10:03] <crab> or $(x).removeClass('a b').addClass('p q');
[06:10:03] <beasty> ok
[06:10:30] <beasty> but for instance i have a 'ap_bad' and a 'ap_bad_white'
[06:10:55] <beasty> and a 'ap_nearlybad' => 'ap_nearlybad_white'
[06:11:33] <beasty> so basicly i need to append a _white to all classes that start with ap_
[06:12:50] <crab> no easy way to do that, afaik
[06:13:14] <beasty> ok
[06:14:50] <developernotes> When you use $("a").on or $("a").live, is there an easy way to identify the href from the link that was clicked?
[06:15:12] <especially-corn> can anyone tell me why class even is not added to the second anchor? $("#menu").find("a:nth-child(2n)").addClass("currentPage");  http://paste.ubuntu.com/754897/
[06:15:54] <especially-corn> i mean class currentPage
[06:16:55] <martin-g> developernotes: $(this).attr('href')
[06:17:03] <kborchers> especially-corn: :nth-child(2) not 2n
[06:17:19] <especially-corn> kborchers, same result
[06:18:12] <kborchers> especially-corn: i think what you actually want is $("#menu").find("a").eq(1).addClass("currentPage");
[06:19:08] <kborchers> especially-corn: which could be shortened to $("#menu a").eq(1).addClass("currentPage");
[06:19:52] <especially-corn> kborchers, it's still not adding the class
[06:20:04] <kborchers> ?demo @ especially-corn
[06:20:05] <bot-t> especially-corn, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[06:21:04] <martin-g> kborchers: I have a demo of my problem at http://jsfiddle.net/gJLCh/9/
[06:21:30] <martin-g> is it possible that 'input' event doesn't have which/keyCode property ?!
[06:21:53] <developernotes> martin-g: perfect - thanks!
[06:22:02] <Yatekii> hi guys
[06:22:18] <Yatekii> i got a problem with jquery eventhandler
[06:22:19] <Yatekii> http://baukuenstler.wapple.ch/?screen=amsee03
[06:22:23] <Yatekii> this is my page
[06:22:37] <Yatekii> if u click on the right arrow obove the big pic
[06:22:45] <Yatekii> it gives 2 alerts
[06:22:49] <Yatekii> or should be
[06:23:07] <Yatekii> if u click further, it will show u more and more alerts per click, the more u click
[06:23:31] <especially-corn> kborchers, works now, thank you, i was editing the wrong js file lol
[06:23:41] <Yatekii> http://pastebin.com/63b3Zq43
[06:23:49] <Yatekii> here's my code
[06:23:58] <thevoice-> Alright, for some reason my ajax posts work fine in Safari
[06:24:04] <thevoice-> but in Firefox they do not work :(
[06:24:04] <beasty> there fixed it :)
[06:24:05] <Yatekii> i just call the function john once on clicking...
[06:24:21] <thevoice-> anyone ever experienced the same thing?
[06:25:05] <Cade> Has anyone here tried to use jquery to initialize Lightbox in a page?
[06:25:33] <Yatekii> Cade: not actually lightbox, but there are some nice other options ;)
[06:26:34] <Cade> I doing this, but for some reason it isn't working. http://pastebin.com/Fm5yyUM5
[06:27:40] <Cade> The js files are being loaded. Firebug shows me that much. But the links just send me to the raw image.
[06:28:13] <Cade> I've got Lightbox working just fine on a different page without Jquery by using regular script tags.
[06:28:56] <GuidoBouman> Cade: Fancybox, http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ is the plugin i most prefer.
[06:29:14] <jkoudys> autocomplete question: how can I set it to autocomplete on only a single field in a multidimensional array/json? e.g. I have {id: 1, name: 'John', school:'Oxford'}; I want the autocomplete to complete only on the name, so 'Jo' would autocomplete to that entry, but 1 or Ox wouldn't
[06:29:17] <GuidoBouman> But lightbox is dependent on the protoype library.
[06:29:26] <Yatekii> Cade u cant combine jquery AND prototype ;)
[06:29:34] <Cade> Oh. You can't?
[06:29:37] <GuidoBouman> Yatekii, You can, but it's crap.
[06:29:40] <Yatekii> nope
[06:29:44] <Yatekii> yeah
[06:29:46] <Cade> Well shit.
[06:29:46] <Yatekii> with some tricks
[06:30:02] <GuidoBouman> Running jQuery in noComflict() mode.
[06:30:22] <GuidoBouman> There's a jQuery variant of Lightbox: http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[06:30:34] <GuidoBouman> But I prefer Fancybox over Lightbox.
[06:30:42] <Yatekii> yep
[06:30:47] <Yatekii> me2
[06:30:58] <Yatekii> guido do u have experience with jquery eventhandler
[06:31:03] <GuidoBouman> V2 release last week is really amazing.
[06:31:17] <Cade> Cool. I can probably use that instead. Thanks.
[06:31:21] <GuidoBouman> Quite a bit, but depends on what you want to use it for.
[06:31:33] <Yatekii> http://pastebin.com/63b3Zq43
[06:31:38] <Yatekii> my code
[06:32:00] <Yatekii> when i click on a link, influenced by the eventhandler, it doesnt call the function john a single time
[06:32:01] <Cade> I've already got the lightbox look&feel on other pages. I don't want to suddenly change that up for this page.
[06:32:07] <Yatekii> it calls it more than once
[06:32:29] <Yatekii> and the times its called are stacking up while clicking more and more
[06:33:20] <Yatekii> cade: maybe that: http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/
[06:33:29] <GuidoBouman> $("a:not(#nohref)").click(john); isn't that: $("a:not(#nohref)").click(john()); ?
[06:33:49] <GuidoBouman> Oh, you've assigned the function as a var.
[06:34:44] <GuidoBouman> for what reason if I may ask? I'm from a php background, so I tend to code everything the pph way.
[06:34:46] <GuidoBouman> php*
[06:35:34] <GuidoBouman> Yatekii, Could you move it over to jsfiddle.net with some code for me to work on?
[06:35:50] <GuidoBouman> Allows for easier debugging.
[06:36:05] <thevoice-> so in firefox when I click on my button which calls a query Post
[06:36:15] <thevoice-> it appears to add the submit to the header and run as a get
[06:36:22] <thevoice-> but it works fine in safari..
[06:36:25] <Yatekii> guido, the problem is that my page has some complicated htmp-generators :P
[06:36:34] <Yatekii> baukuenstler.wapple.ch
[06:36:37] <Yatekii> thats my page
[06:36:48] <Yatekii> wait: http://baukuenstler.wapple.ch
[06:36:57] <Yatekii> @Â guidobouman
[06:38:44] <Yatekii> gotta catch my bus in few mins, guido, but i'll return in an hour if u were in mood to analize my prob in tha time :P
[06:39:56] <GuidoBouman> Yatekii, Okay, I'll look at it later on.
[06:41:33] <Yatekii> kk ty
[06:50:11] <Cade> Can someone explain $('a[@rel*=lightbox]') to me? I get that it's doing some checking on the 'rel' attribute of <a> tags, but I can't tell exactly what.
[06:50:37] <GuidoBouman> It matches lightbox with a wildcard (*)
[06:50:49] <GuidoBouman> And the @ is something Id never use.
[06:50:53] <GuidoBouman> I'd*
[06:51:17] <Cade> What does it do?
[06:52:09] <GuidoBouman> For as a far as I know it's something the prototype library uses.
[06:52:09] <Beerkeeper> search for a rel* tag with lightbox as value?
[06:52:17] <GuidoBouman> No.
[06:52:22] <Cade> No, I mean @
[06:52:37] <GuidoBouman> Beerkeeper, it looks for a reltag that contains lightbox somehwere in the value.
[06:52:48] <GuidoBouman> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:53:42] <Cade> @ isn't on that page
[06:54:17] <GuidoBouman> I know, because It's a prototype quirk.
[06:54:35] <berndj> $('li span.foo, li span.bar') - that selects all foo or bar spans in a list item, not bar spans in (all foo spans and list items) in a list item, right?
[06:54:49] <GuidoBouman> It's also not in the css declaration, so it's best to just not ever use it. ;)
[06:55:35] <GuidoBouman> berndj, What I just pasted, scroll down.
[06:55:48] <GuidoBouman> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:56:08] <GuidoBouman> 1/5th from the bottom: Multiple selectors.
[06:56:29] <GuidoBouman> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[06:57:32] <tom__> is it safe to change the id of an element with $elem.attr('id', 'newId') ? or do browsers not like that?
[06:57:57] <berndj> GuidoBouman, sure, i'm asking specifically about operator precedence
[06:58:21] <berndj> is it implicit that because , appears further down, it has lower precedence?
[07:00:41] <anli_> Is null valid json?
[07:01:10] <Toskan> hi guys... someone knows when jquery core 1.9 will be released? not date... rather month or quartal
[07:01:11] <Cade> Ok, I have this, http://pastebin.com/dqhNRMP2 but it still isn't working.
[07:02:22] <Toskan> i mean jquery UI 1.9 (sorry) .... when will it be released?
[07:02:34] <Brammm> Is there any way to have a jquery UI dialog act as prompt? I need to halt execution of code until the user clicks one of the two dialog buttons
[07:04:16] <anli_> Seemed that null was valid json after all
[07:04:43] <diverdud`>  how do i set the size of a checkbox?
[07:06:02] <Brammm> diverdud`: you can't
[07:06:52] <Jon47> diverdud` you can simulate it though: http://lea.verou.me/css3-secrets/#custom-form-controls
[07:07:22] <GuidoBouman> berndj, Like you said, and as you can read on that page: It restarts.
[07:07:32] <GuidoBouman> Complete different selection queries.
[07:07:45] <GuidoBouman> How'd jQuery know where to begin and where to end?
[07:08:02] <GuidoBouman> Not really flexible if they'd do it in any other way, right?
[07:08:07] <GuidoBouman> And just execute your code.
[07:08:18] <GuidoBouman> You'd find out eventually.
[07:09:08] <Beerkeeper> hmm, can you add buttons to a dialogbox in the header? Say next to the close button?
[07:09:15] <berndj> Brammm, not sure what you mean by "halt execution", but do you maybe want a modal:true dialog?
[07:09:34] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, You can't change the checkbox's size, but you can change it's wrappers size.
[07:09:44] <Brammm> berndj: I'll post some code
[07:10:05] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, nevermind what I said.
[07:11:08] <GuidoBouman> if(confirm('Are you sure'))
[07:11:08] <GuidoBouman> {
[07:11:08] <GuidoBouman> Your code
[07:11:08] <GuidoBouman> }
[07:11:20] <GuidoBouman> Oh, wait UI
[07:11:41] <Beerkeeper> hmm, can you add buttons to a dialogbox in the header? Say next to the close button? I can't find it in the manual and I want an edit button next to the close button :(
[07:12:02] <Beerkeeper> Only button option I see is for at the bottom
[07:12:15] <GuidoBouman> Beerkeeper, berndj his modal is the right solution.
[07:12:29] <GuidoBouman> Beerkeeper, why would you want to add buttons at a different place?
[07:13:02] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: hmmm is he using custom images or what?
[07:13:06] <Beerkeeper> GuidoBouman: a simple editbutton at the top, for a slick design
[07:13:06] <Brammm> GuidoBouman berndj This is what I was trying: http://jsfiddle.net/LRRaL/
[07:13:30] <Brammm> I was hoping that the code would wait for a return value from the AllowYesNo function, but it doesn't
[07:13:41] <Brammm> the code gets executed immediatly and the dialog stays open...
[07:14:00] <Beerkeeper> something like this: http://nettuts.s3.amazonaws.com/127_iNETTUTS/demo/index.html
[07:14:09] <Brammm> I can use a confirm message, but I'd love to use the dialog() function to keep things styled the same
[07:15:08] <berndj> Brammm, no, if that's what you want you need to use the continuation passing style http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style
[07:15:17] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, yeah, most probably.
[07:15:44] <berndj> it gets hairy/spaghetti if you're not careful though. or even if you are!
[07:15:53] <GuidoBouman> Do you have some HTML to go with that?
[07:16:02] <GuidoBouman> @Bramm
[07:16:18] <Toskan> @Brammm no
[07:16:21] <Brammm> GuidoBouman: it's basically just a tablerow, don't see how the HTML is of importance
[07:16:42] <Toskan> halting javascript execution like for confirm is not possible
[07:16:44] <Brammm> berndj: I guess I have to do the hiding in the dialog button function?
[07:17:15] <Toskan> you can hack your way through the jungle with dirty tricks and live with that if you really want it
[07:17:23] <Brammm> Toskan: not really :p
[07:17:30] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: it seems to be quite difficult to see how he did that
[07:17:49] <GuidoBouman> Brammm, Ik speel graag met de html, ik wil weten wat je probeert te doen.
[07:18:01] <Cade> I'm trying to use the lightbox plugin, while also importing the plugin file with getScript(), but for some reason it isn't working.
[07:18:01] <Brammm> I'll just go with a confirm, as that's what I really need.
[07:18:09] <Toskan> yeah i pulled the plug on jquery confirmation as well... just not worth it
[07:19:03] <Brammm> GuidoBouman: When a user changes a select, some things get removed/hidden. I want to confirm this before actually doing it
[07:21:03] <Cade> Is there any particular reason why this wouldn't work? http://pastebin.com/dqhNRMP2
[07:21:40] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: can you tell me how it is done?
[07:23:09] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, http://lea.verou.me/css3-secrets/#custom-form-controls That page?
[07:23:17] <GuidoBouman> The css is plain visible there.
[07:23:20] <GuidoBouman> It's just css.
[07:24:02] <GuidoBouman> It increases the size, but that doesn't look well on maxc
[07:24:20] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: but what is this root
[07:24:26] <Beerkeeper> GuidoBouman: I use the dialog as a widget with configure options (I could use the dialog as a userlist, so I can select the columns to show in the dialog through a configure/edit page)
[07:24:27] <diverdud`> or :root
[07:24:44] <Beerkeeper> That's why I want an edit/configure button at top
[07:25:52] <Beerkeeper> Cade: does it work when you include the javascript file manually?
[07:26:37] <Cade> Here's the thing. The page doesn't strictly speaking "exist". It's all CMS and url rewriting.
[07:26:57] <EdwardIII> mythpage
[07:27:08] <xsamurai> I can successfully load an external js file using get script but when i reference the function i get an undefined error, I am using the same method of including and referencing this function in other scripts
[07:27:09] <Cade> But JS and CSS files get pulled in if they have the right filename.
[07:27:18] <xsamurai> i dont know why its not working in this particular file
[07:28:34] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i remove all before and after "foo-bar"? edit-foo-bar-node-form
[07:29:44] <timing> 'edit-foo-bar-node-form'.replace('edit-', '').replace('-node-form', '');
[07:29:56] <timing> yan_nick: unless edit and node-form is different every time
[07:30:06] <timing> then my example is not very dynamic :-)
[07:30:23] <yan_nick> timing: okay that's cool
[07:30:28] <yan_nick> timing: it's enough
[07:31:24] <xsamurai> console.log(data) shows the function , im a bit lost as to why its showing undefined errors
[07:31:38] <EdwardIII> hrm is there a way i can create a dispatch for a certain event, e.g. if($someObject.hasBeenClosed){ // some behaviour } ?
[07:32:05] <EdwardIII> working with some of this jquery ui stuff and it creates a lot of elements, when someone's clicking close on a dialog box i'd like to do something
[07:32:21] <EdwardIII> remove the element that 'close' has been clicked on from the dom specifically
[07:32:39] <xsamurai> why not assign the close link a  name and create a onclick event ?
[07:33:17] <EdwardIII> xsamurai: it's all generated by jquery ui so it's difficult for me to do that
[07:33:50] <EdwardIII> actually maybe .dialog has a 'onClose' dispatcher
[07:34:31] <xsamurai> EdwardIII: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/366854/jquery-ui-dialog-box-close-function
[07:34:34] <xsamurai> try that
[07:34:35] <GuidoBouman> !google
[07:34:38] <xsamurai> yes
[07:34:40] <GuidoBouman> !+google
[07:34:52] <GuidoBouman> Mehs, doesn't work here.

[07:35:31] <Anticom> hi all
[07:35:37] <xec> !g :root css
[07:35:45] <xec> worth a shot
[07:36:08] <Anticom> other than .html() i need to get the full html string of an element, e.g. <span>content</span> instead of just "content"
[07:36:12] <Anticom> any ideas on how to do that?
[07:36:31] <xec> ?g :root css
[07:36:33] <bot-t> xec, CSS - :root - http://www.quirksmode.org/css/root.html
[07:36:36] <xec> yay
[07:39:22] <GuidoBouman> xec, F me, that's it. :P
[07:39:43] <keybo> if i have an array that contains multiple strings how can turn them into one string?
[07:40:11] <Anticom> =(
[07:40:25] <erichynds> keybo: join("")
[07:40:31] <GuidoBouman> Anticom, There's .get()
[07:40:50] <GuidoBouman> ?g jquery get element
[07:40:51] <bot-t> GuidoBouman, .get() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:41:03] <Anticom> GuidoBouman ??
[07:41:18] <erichynds> ?g jquery outerhtml @ Anticom
[07:41:18] <bot-t> Anticom, jquery - Get selected element's outer HTML - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419749/get-selected-elements-outer-html
[07:41:20] <Anticom> but what has that to do with my question?
[07:41:31] <Anticom> thank you erichynds
[07:42:25] <xsamurai> Can somebody take a look at this http://dpaste.com/663877/ ,  I can successfully load an external js file but when i reference the function i get an undefined error, I am using the same method of including and referencing this function in other scripts
[07:42:55] <Anticom> works :)
[07:43:13] <GuidoBouman> Anticom, erichynds' was right, I failed.
[07:44:32] <Anticom> GuidoBouman you're welcome (=
[07:44:45] <Cade> Does getScript require an absolute URL or can you use a relative one?
[07:44:46] <Anticom> was just wondering, how i could address a certain dom element using ajax :D
[07:45:04] <GuidoBouman> Anticom, Wait what?
[07:45:22] <Anticom> because you suggested .get() ;)
[07:45:26] <GuidoBouman> xsamurai, Can you put your code in fsfiddle.net?
[07:45:40] <xsamurai> sure one sec
[07:47:28] <xec> that's one long second xD
[07:49:01] <GuidoBouman> ;)
[07:50:43] <xsamurai> GuidoBouman: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/Wpjcu/ , heres the referencing function as well http://dpaste.com/663883/
[07:53:49] <GuidoBouman> xsamurai, Oh, wait, do you have this code live somewhere?
[07:54:15] <imakewebthings> xsamurai: getScript = async.  You should be doing most of that stuff inside the callback
[07:54:22] <xsamurai> unfortunately internal server
[07:54:32] <GuidoBouman> What imakewebthings said:
[07:54:49] <GuidoBouman> It'll call the getUrlVars function before.
[07:55:02] <GuidoBouman> Why don't you just load the js file with <script>?
[07:55:11] <xsamurai> ahh i see makes sense
[07:55:16] <xsamurai> GuidoBouman: being lazy =)
[07:55:20] <xsamurai> let me go ahead and do that
[07:56:47] <Cade> I'm using getScript() to load in a js file. Thing is, I'm not entirely sure that the file is being recognized as something the browser needs to execute. Is there anything else I need to do?
[07:59:52] <Cade> I brought in the js file using document.write("<scr" + "ipt.... and it worked fine. getScript() isn't telling the browser what to do with the file.
[07:59:58] <GuidoBouman> What's up with you people using getScript? :P
[08:00:22] <Cade> Because I can't use a regular script tag in this page.
[08:00:24] <megatrond> any reason an element should not be removed using .detach()? data is passed to var but not removed from page
[08:01:29] <GuidoBouman> You can't?
[08:01:58] <pjeweb> I need an alternative to jquery tmpl (because its not maintained anymore). Features: marker for vars (with dot notation), if and else, template from String (not as html script foobar)
[08:02:16] <Cade> No. The page doesn't, strictly speaking, actually "exist". It's all CMS and URL rewriting.
[08:02:53] <GuidoBouman> Cade, okay.
[08:03:14] <GuidoBouman> Don't know if that's a smart setup, but lets assume it is.
[08:03:30] <Cade> But if a js or css file has the same filename, then it gets imported.
[08:03:34] <GuidoBouman> What's your problem? you said doing document.write() worked?
[08:04:03] <Cade> Yeah. I just did that a second ago.
[08:04:45] <Cade> I guess I can work with that. It just seems like a cheap hack.
[08:04:49] <GuidoBouman> But? Or is it already solved? jQuery docs say the file that has been retrieved willl get executed.
[08:06:32] <Cade> And some of the pages I came across suggested that the docs were incorrect.
[08:07:23] <Cade> But whatever. It's working now.
[08:08:12] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: http://www.handlebarsjs.com/ ?
[08:09:02] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: looks great!
[08:10:16] <keybo> when you reference an iframe what does the [0] mean after it?
[08:11:24] <ablomen> keybo, it get's the dom element instead of the jquery object
[08:11:29] <xec> keybo: i'm guessing index
[08:12:16] <keybo> basically i'm trying to print the content of multiple iframes, but using each to iterate through them gives me a warning that its ignoring too frequent print calls
[08:12:26] <keybo> is there way I can print them all in one call?
[08:12:31] <GuidoBouman> imakewebthings, lovely.
[08:13:16] <pjeweb> imakewebthings but i need it for the browser. :D It seems it is for nodejs and other server foobar
[08:13:50] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: not at all, what gives you that impression?
[08:14:07] <GuidoBouman> $('iframe').each(function(){
[08:14:07] <GuidoBouman> alert($(this).html());
[08:14:07] <GuidoBouman> });
[08:14:17] <xec> keybo: maybe it's possible to somehow concatenate all the content together first, and then print?
[08:14:23] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: that: https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js
[08:14:49] <xec> keybo: maybe in a makeshift div that you remove again after the print call, or something less of an ugly hack :D
[08:15:08] <imakewebthings> "Simply download the package from GitHub and add it to your web pages"
[08:15:20] <keybo> ugly hacks are beautiful if they work, doesnt need to be elegant lol im a letter packer in the admin office here where i work
[08:15:33] <andrew9183> its snowing here, ugh
[08:15:39] <pjeweb> imakewebthings ok but it is also for server :)
[08:15:44] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: the Node requirement at the bottom is for DEVS who want to modify the project
[08:15:45] <keybo> trying to make myself a little time saver that I can put info into and it will print multiple sheets at once
[08:15:56] <keybo> noone else will see it i'll just save myself about 2 hours a day :P
[08:16:04] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: or to "prerender" templates...
[08:17:41] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: no that css does not produce a textbox
[08:17:45] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: sure, you can use it in node, but it isn't required.  It's for any JS environment
[08:17:54] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: that css produces a circle
[08:18:12] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: as shown in the right side of the page
[08:18:19] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: i was just wondering because the repo is huge (for a "small" template engine in js)...
[08:18:25] <andrew9183> is there a way i can store an array of objects in jquery ?
[08:18:57] <Cork[home]> andrew9183: what type of objects are you talking about?
[08:19:28] <andrew9183> for example, i am returning a list of bikes each with an id, color, and position from java
[08:19:32] <xec> andrew9183: think of jquery as a plugin to javascript... you can store arrays in javascript, if thats what you're askin
[08:19:33] <andrew9183> what's the best way to store them in jquery ?
[08:19:43] <xec> +g
[08:19:50] <diverdud`> how do i control the size of checkboxes?
[08:20:05] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: I don't think it says anywhere that it's "small"
[08:20:15] <Cork[home]> ?.data @ andrew9183
[08:20:15] <bot-t> andrew9183, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[08:20:37] <Cork[home]> diverdud`: you can't
[08:20:59] <Cork[home]> diverdud`: you need to generate your own chackboxes if you want to modify them
[08:21:03] <andrew9183> ah cool, thanks
[08:21:09] <Cork[home]> *checkboxes
[08:21:27] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: but i think it should be :D - so i'm going to search for another lib
[08:22:26] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, Dude, if you need the css for scaling:
[08:22:26] <GuidoBouman> -moz-transform: scale(2.5);
[08:22:26] <GuidoBouman> -o-transform: scale(2.5);
[08:22:26] <GuidoBouman> -webkit-transform: scale(2.5);
[08:22:26] <GuidoBouman> -ms-transform: scale(2.5);
[08:22:27] <GuidoBouman> -webkit-transform: scale(2.5);
[08:22:34] <GuidoBouman> That's what he did.
[08:22:38] <GuidoBouman> Just check his source.
[08:23:22] <xec> silly webkit, needs to be asked twice
[08:23:26] <Cork[home]> that doesn't work all over the place reliably though
[08:23:34] <Jak2000> hi all
[08:23:38] <Jak2000> my question is: how to ask a date/time value?
[08:24:30] <jbeach> diverdud`: Lea Verou has some great thoughts on checkboxes and CSS
[08:25:01] <jbeach> http://lea.verou.me/ft2010/#intro
[08:25:10] <netpork> Jak2000: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[08:25:13] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, But one small tip: Don't change the sizes.  checkboxes aren't mean to be scaled.
[08:25:17] <Jon47> dude's not listening, he asked the same question an hour ago and i gave him the same answer
[08:25:35] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, Go for a custom design with jQuery,
[08:25:48] <Jak2000> netpork thx
[08:27:36] <Jak2000> netpork i need the user input a date time value
[08:27:48] <EdwardIII> heh great nick
[08:28:05] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: nano small enough? https://github.com/trix/nano
[08:28:53] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: :D close but with if / else...
[08:28:57] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: why is it bad to scale the checkbox...what can go wrong?
[08:29:16] <gho5t> when I submit a form via jquery e.g. $('#myForm').submit() I am getting different results than pushing a submit button with the form. Any idea why?
[08:29:19] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: it seems i can only scale it 1.9 times
[08:29:55] <rampion> I've noticed that I can pass .html() an array of dom elements, rather than an HTML string, and it replaces the contents with the dom elements
[08:29:55] <rampion> e.g. $(selector).html( $(selector).children().toArray().reverse() ) reverses the order of the children.
[08:29:55] <rampion> This isn't in the api (http://api.jquery.com/html/), but is it safe to rely on?
[08:30:15] <GuidoBouman> diverdud`, Weird, that other guy had 2.5. Maybe your browser limits it.
[08:30:24] <GuidoBouman> But what is the purpose of increasing the size?
[08:30:26] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: i have safari
[08:30:41] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: to make it easier to see
[08:30:44] <EdwardIII> hrm, this is producing Object has no method close() on line 14? https://gist.github.com/1409700
[08:31:41] <gho5t> when I submit a form via jquery e.g. $('#myForm').submit() I am getting different results than pushing a submit button with the form. Any idea why?
[08:31:59] <diverdud`> GuidoBouman: hmm ok...mozilla can scale it larger
[08:33:16] <GuidoBouman> gho5t, You really want to use append instead of after.
[08:33:24] <GuidoBouman> And close is not a jQuery or javascript method.
[08:33:46] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: i think it becomes available form jquery ui after you run .dialog on an object
[08:33:50] <GuidoBouman> gho5t, You probably want to use .hide() or something.
[08:33:58] <gho5t> GuidoBouman: I think you got the wrong guy
[08:34:11] <GuidoBouman> Fail.
[08:34:14] <GuidoBouman> Sorreh.
[08:34:37] <EdwardIII> gho5t: anything weird bound to the submit button on the form?
[08:34:44] <GuidoBouman> EdwardIII, Or you didn't call dialog on it, or you should use .hide();
[08:34:46] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: that actually looks very good: https://github.com/olado/doT/blob/master/doT.js
[08:34:57] <gho5t> EdwardIII: not on the button no
[08:35:07] <EdwardIII> gho5t: under inspect element you can usually find out under 'event listeners' - or at least a clue
[08:35:14] <gho5t> EdwardIII: ok
[08:35:51] <gho5t> EdwardIII: if it matters, the way I'm submitting the form with jquery is making a button added to jquery-ui dialog submit the form when pressed
[08:36:00] <GuidoBouman> EdwardIII, You really want to use append instead of after by the way.
[08:36:28] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: yeah, i think you're right!
[08:36:34] <slackerr> i need to create draggable and resizeable textarea using jquery. does anybody know similar plugin for textarea?
[08:36:36] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: otherwise i'd get </body><my stuff> heh
[08:36:39] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: tanks :D I'll try that
[08:36:44] <GuidoBouman> Bingo.
[08:36:54] <imakewebthings> pjeweb: ah yea, underscore has its own templating system too, forgot
[08:36:55] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: i think i am applying .dialog correctly though
[08:36:59] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: because the dialog appears?
[08:37:20] <imakewebthings> pjeweb:  been writing nothing but jade lately, so i haven't seen a lot of the newer client side templating stuff
[08:37:35] <GuidoBouman> Hmm? I think it's hide. But I'll check if dielog creates the .close method for you.
[08:38:09] <GuidoBouman> But when it creates the dialog, I guess it should also have that mathod. If it doesn't then you're just out of luck. ;)
[08:38:40] <GuidoBouman> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[08:38:47] <GuidoBouman> .dialog('close');
[08:38:59] <pjeweb> imakewebthings: yes i have to do it on client-side :( I'd love to do that in node.js
[08:39:01] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: it lists it as a method too - http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-close
[08:39:52] <GuidoBouman> EdwardIII, Check what I just wrote you. It says use.dialog('close'); to close the dialog.
[08:40:47] <EdwardIII> GuidoBouman: switched to that, doesn't error but doesn't close either
[08:41:07] <EdwardIII> is using the same modalBox for all of them a problem perhaps?
[08:41:39] <EdwardIII> is it that when i try to setup the close, it isn't a dialog box yet?
[08:41:51] <EdwardIII> it's trapped, like a tiny frightened infant, in a closure it can never escape?
[08:42:15] <DobreJoe> I have several <input name="item_x" /> but they are not ordered (item_3, item_7, item_8). How could I rename all so they are item_1, item_2, item_3, etc.?
[08:42:23] <GuidoBouman> EdwardIII, Something like that. :P You should instantiate all dialogs beforehand with autoOpen: false;
[08:42:42] * EdwardIII scratches his head
[08:42:44] <GuidoBouman> That way you can open and close the dialogs at will with .dialog('open');
[08:43:03] <GuidoBouman> and dialog('close');
[08:43:24] <keybo> how could i concatenate these iframes to print them in one job rather than sequentially then does anyone have any ideas?
[08:43:46] <GuidoBouman> And I think you should use var myDialog = $('#dialog_id').dialog({ autoOpen: false });
[08:44:00] <GuidoBouman> And pass that reference to your functions too.
[08:44:14] <GuidoBouman> Not sure if that matters too much though.
[08:44:53] <gho5t> EdwardIII: yeah there's nothing on the submit button. i think it has to do with this dialog's button. because even making the button call the click function of the submit() button is having different results than pressing the submit button manually.
[08:45:09] <EdwardIII> gho5t: any chance you can pastebin? it's tricky to visualise
[08:45:19] <gho5t> ok
[08:46:35] <JAAulde> Hi all.  I'm trying to work with a jQuery UI button set, but I cannot seem to get the icons to show on it, and the text to hide.  Here is my demo code: http://jsfiddle.net/eBjxU/ Any thoughts?  Thanks!
[08:47:03] <GuidoBouman> Keybo, you need the html of each div?
[08:47:23] <GuidoBouman> iframe I mean?
[08:47:31] <JAAulde> Sorry, found a flaw in the ink I gave above, here is a better example: http://jsfiddle.net/eBjxU/1/
[08:47:31] <keybo> of each iframe yes, but each one uses its own stylesheet too etc
[08:47:39] <JAAulde> s/ink/link/
[08:47:56] <GuidoBouman> keybo, What are you exactly trying to do?
[08:48:26] <GuidoBouman> Do you just need the HTML or also the CSS? And what do you want to use it for?
[08:48:35] <desandro> I'm checking on a outerWidth / outerHeight bug http://jsfiddle.net/desandro/5se4t/
[08:48:41] <keybo> i need the html and print styles associated with that html
[08:48:49] <keybo> basically my workflow is like this
[08:48:54] <desandro> WebKit isn't returning proper values
[08:49:38] <gho5t> i think i figured it out
[08:49:43] <gho5t> 2 forms with same id
[08:49:53] <gho5t> due to some grabbing of html and putting it in the dialog
[08:49:55] <gho5t> sorry. thanks
[08:50:40] <JAAulde> Strange, setting the icons to the input labels using class attr in markup works, whereas using the `icons` option for `buttonset` does not: http://jsfiddle.net/eBjxU/2/
[08:50:47] <JAAulde> GUess that's what I'll do
[08:51:20] <keybo> I have a html form that i fill out then submit, then on the server side i have made a script that opens a required number of template files, adding my variables that i posted from the form, then sends each document back to my html as an array, I then put each amended document into its own iframe with the intention of printing it
[08:52:22] <Zogot> why Iframe
[08:52:25] <GuidoBouman> Wait wait.
[08:52:41] <GuidoBouman> The whole use of iframes is pointless here.
[08:52:45] <GuidoBouman> Lets take a setp back:
[08:52:47] <GuidoBouman> step*
[08:53:33] <Whirl3d> good morning
[08:53:38] <GuidoBouman> When people submit a form you can capture that and make an ajax call.
[08:53:52] <desandro> never mind, looks like its bug #10639
[08:54:06] <GuidoBouman> Or you could just render that in your page straight away if you don't mind your page refreshing after the submit.
[08:55:00] <GuidoBouman> I'd just compile the whole final html from the server.
[08:55:19] <keybo> mmmm
[08:55:25] <GuidoBouman> It doesn't make sense to trow it to an iFrame and pull that to put it back in the content.
[08:55:27] <rethus> desandro: no, is a race-condition  http://jsfiddle.net/5se4t/3/
[08:55:45] <rethus> adding text-input while read out the size cause in a race-condition
[08:57:02] <Zogot> ? .html @ keypo
[08:57:02] <bot-t> keypo, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:57:39] <GuidoBouman> Zogot That's not really part of the question anymore. ;)
[08:58:34] <rethus> desandro: play a little with my example and you will see, it works well on webkit ?!
[09:01:30] <asher^> is there a jquery function that will allow me to set a property for all elements in an array?
[09:01:47] <keybo> so you think i should keep my styles in a stylesheet on my form page, change my template files so they have no head etc, concatenate the strings and put them into a single div then print that?
[09:01:55] <CoolCoder> For some reasons, keypress is not working for Chrome on tab/enter keys. Please check the code for more information http://pastebin.com/pc05GCht
[09:01:58] <miketaylr> ?each @ asher^
[09:01:58] <bot-t> asher^, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:02:58] <asher^> that came to mind, im not sure if i can do what i want with it though. i have this: chart.series[0].data[0].graphic.element).attr(....  id like this to work on each element in data. can each do that?
[09:03:22] <asher^> $(chart.series[0].data[0].graphic.element).attr(... rather
[09:03:33] <Eviltwin> Wait, what?
[09:03:45] <Eviltwin> Each chart.series[0].data[0].graphic.element[i] or each chart.series[0].data[i].graphic.element?
[09:03:52] <asher^> the latter
[09:04:21] <Eviltwin> $($.map(chart.series[0].data,function(){return this.graphic.element})).attr(...)
[09:04:28] <SparK_BR> Hey, I'm new... just watching
[09:04:39] <Eviltwin> I *highly* suggest var $all = $($.map(chart.series[0].data,function(){return this.graphic.element});
[09:04:42] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[09:04:46] <Eviltwin> So you don't have to do that over and over
[09:04:54] <asher^> hmm
[09:05:13] <asher^> thanks, ill give that a shot
[09:09:58] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, good morning. What plugin do you use for form validation? I am looking at the .validation plugin and it is filled with namespaced functions like $.validate().init(), etc. Plus it clutters the jQuery namespace and doesn''t use .on for event delegation...any suggestions?
[09:11:16] <emelpy> CoolCoder: use keydown instead of keypress. For some reason chrome doesn't respect keypress for all keys.
[09:11:25] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: The one I've seen used most is this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[09:11:34] <Eviltwin> I actually personally don't use any, usually code stuff as needed
[09:11:40] <Eviltwin> Not a recommended practice but I'm a control freak
[09:11:49] <mdevilz> Hi, I was wondering if anyone has any experience in using the dateui picker and then cloning it? As I have tried doing this, but I only get a clone with the UI image in the input field, but only the original datepicker works
[09:13:01] <Eviltwin> marthinal: Try .clone(true)
[09:13:41] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, thanks for the reply. the plugin you mentioned is the one that abuses the jquery namespace, uses namespaced function calls, doesn't use .on (didn't exist when written), etc.
[09:14:17] <Whirl3d> So I usually code myself as well. that's why I was hoping to encapsulate my usual code in a plugin.
[09:14:56] <Whirl3d> I appreciate all your help. I guess I'll follow your example (best practice or not) and continue coding myself.
[09:16:05] <Eviltwin> How does it abuse it exactly?
[09:16:19] <mdevilz> thank you Eviltwin :)
[09:17:23] <Eviltwin> I see .validate, .valid, and maybe .rules
[09:19:29] <Eviltwin> Maybe it does more littering than I know about
[09:19:34] <mdevilz> Eviltwin: okay it allows for multiple datepickers now, but it only changes the date on the first one. any ideas
[09:20:11] <Eviltwin> mdevilz: Perhaps .clone() and re-.datepicker()?
[09:30:25] <igcewieling> using .css() what is the correct syntax for adding !important?  Is it $('*').css('cursor', 'progress!important');  ?  Doesn't seem to work, but I could easily be doing something else wrong.
[09:31:28] <mdevilz> Eviltwin: any ideas on how I would re.datepicker()? as I am not clear on what you mean by that. Thanks
[09:33:53] <jimmyrcom> so when a selector is connected it only searches 1 level deep and if not it recurses through the childen? #foo.a.b vs #foo .a .b?
[09:34:32] <diverdud`> is it possible to somehow make a rule that applies to both input type=text and type=password?
[09:35:22] <dabear> diverdud`: $("input[type=text], input[type=password]")
[09:40:11] <pvivek> I am a rookie . I am not able to figure out which all js and which all css i've to include to get this timepicker working. http://code.google.com/p/jquery-utils/wiki/UiTimepickr . Would be very glad if someone can guide me through
[09:43:43] <Yatekii> hey guys
[09:44:05] <Yatekii> it would be nice if there is someone who has experiaence with the jquery eventhandler :)
[09:46:45] <Eviltwin> ?
[09:48:48] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: #foo.a.b means an element with ID foo, and classes a and b. #foo.a .b means an element with class b that has an ancestor with ID foo and class a. #foo .a.b means an element with classes a and b and a parent with ID foo. #foo .a .b means an element with class b that has an ancestor with class a that has an ancestor with ID #foo
[09:49:50] <jimmyrcom> thanks Eviltwin. I just implemented jquery selectors partially in erlang. I thought I was done. Now I know whitespace matters ;_;
[09:50:05] <Eviltwin> Well CSS selectors are this way too
[09:52:12] <BMCouto> Hi, how do I retrieve on success the info that I store on data of an ajax() call?
[09:52:47] <BMCouto> like $.ajax({data:'foo=bar', success:function() {//gett bar
[09:52:51] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: I suggest you look at: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[09:53:49] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: You do var data="foo=bar"; $.ajax({data:data,success:function(){//use data
[09:54:16] <jimmyrcom> thanks, my css/html is outdated >>
[09:55:48] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  maybe im not explaining myself correctly but that doesnt work for me
[09:55:49] <bonhoffer> how do i insert something at the beginning of a div instead of replacing all it's contents with .html?
[09:56:19] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  i have an ajax() call inside a for, so i need to use on success a var that changes on every cicly of the for
[09:56:30] <jimmyrcom> prepend()
[09:56:32] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: .prepend instead of .append
[09:56:37] <bonhoffer> jimmyrcom: thanks!
[09:56:45] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  ?
[09:56:51] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:57:10] <Eviltwin> Wrong B
[09:57:15] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  did you get my idea?
[09:57:40] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: Why can't you do use the var?
[09:57:56] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: Can you make a pastebin or jsFiddle of your situation and what you're trying to do?
[09:58:12] <BMCouto> because by the time success fires, the for and runned 3 or 4 times and the var has changed
[09:59:02] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  please check http://jsfiddle.net/bkdpR/
[10:00:21] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  did you understand my problem?
[10:01:27] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: http://jsfiddle.net/bkdpR/1/
[10:01:35] <jimmyrcom> BMCouto: success: (function(data){ })(vars,to,import)
[10:02:14] <jimmyrcom> well no that wouldn't work sorry
[10:03:39] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  thanks you're the man!
[10:03:40] <jimmyrcom> BMCouto: success: (function(vars,to,import){ return function(data){.. }})(vars,to,import)
[10:03:45] <Eviltwin> No
[10:03:48] <Eviltwin> Just do it my way
[10:04:13] <BMCouto> i never used that i have to understand it
[10:04:20] <BMCouto> jimmyrcom:  thanks! :)
[10:04:24] <Eviltwin> It's called a closure
[10:05:07] <c09ff> hi
[10:05:22] <Eviltwin> Every time a function is run it's args and vars, a copy of them are made
[10:05:45] <Eviltwin> its*
[10:05:58] <Eviltwin> Let me try that again
[10:06:09] <Eviltwin> Every time a function is run, a copy of its its args and vars
[10:06:19] <Eviltwin> And any functions defined inside of it will have access to those copies
[10:06:19] <jimmyrcom> it grabs the environment at the specific point in time, instead of referencing globals at the point of being called
[10:06:30] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: Not exactly
[10:06:33] <Silowyi> what would be a more jquery-esque way to access this variable: top.document.getElementById('namelist').contentWindow.arrValues
[10:06:47] <jimmyrcom> it grabs the environment it needs when it's created
[10:07:05] <danielss89> Hi.. this query carousel: http://www.maersk.com/Pages/default.aspx <-- is that some a special plugin, or is it just custom made?
[10:07:14] <danielss89> if anyone knows it or knows a similar one :)
[10:07:16] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: Again, not exactly
[10:07:22] <lugzer> hi
[10:07:47] <jimmyrcom> =/, I'm used to lisp and scheme
[10:08:16] <zeppo> member:danielss89: you can use ScrollTo to achieve the same result
[10:08:17] <BMCouto> just for curiosity
[10:08:30] <zeppo> oops sorry
[10:08:33] <BMCouto> whats the difference between your approach Eviltwin and jimmyrcom 's approach?
[10:08:42] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: http://jsfiddle.net/hMS56/
[10:08:48] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: His is significantly longer and less flexible
[10:09:02] <lugzer> i have a strange problem - i wrote some function which i apply to an element when clicked. but i don't want this function to be applied when i click the element for the second time. how would i "disable" the function from the element on the second click?
[10:09:15] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  hmm ok i have to study that, didnt really understood why
[10:10:12] <Eviltwin> lugzer: function myFunc(event){ $(this).unbind("click",myFunc); ...; } $("#foo").bind("click",myFunc);
[10:10:14] <jimmyrcom> yeah, it can reference globals in javascript. should never use globals unless they're constants though
[10:10:36] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: Most languages have globals and locals
[10:10:44] <Eviltwin> jimmyrcom: JavaScript has globals, locals, and nonlocals
[10:10:47] <Eviltwin> i.e. everything in between
[10:11:00] <diverdud`> what is nonlocals?
[10:11:58] <lugzer> Eviltwin, thanks i'll look into unbind
[10:12:03] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  does this still make sense or am i repeating myself? http://jsfiddle.net/bkdpR/2/
[10:12:43] <especially-corn> can anyone tell me why the it's not adding the class? http://jsfiddle.net/KVGbs/3/
[10:13:01] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/dW7Fv/
[10:13:34] <Eviltwin> BMCouto: You need to define $countryID (I removed it)
[10:14:40] <BMCouto> Eviltwin:  its there right? http://jsfiddle.net/bkdpR/3/
[10:14:58] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: http://jsfiddle.net/KVGbs/10/
[10:15:17] <Yatekii> guys, my jquery is very strange
[10:15:26] <Yatekii> see here: http://baukuenstler.wapple.ch/?screen=amsee03
[10:15:35] <Yatekii> 2 errors per pageload should be displayed
[10:15:37] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, i want it the other way around
[10:15:41] <Yatekii> * per click
[10:15:49] <Yatekii> but there are 4 at first click
[10:15:54] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: So you want hide me to show it?
[10:15:55] <Yatekii> 6 at 2nd click
[10:16:06] <Yatekii> hÃ¶?
[10:16:28] <Yatekii> eviltwin what do u mean? oO :S
[10:16:54] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, and i don't want it to be inside the div, i want the div to be an outisde element that covers the current page
[10:17:31] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, kind of like modal dialogs have
[10:18:57] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: Replace line 114 ($("a:not(#nohref)").click(john);) of ajax.js with $(document).delegate("a:not(#nohref)","click",john); then remove line 109 ($('a:not(#nohref)').live('click',john);)
[10:19:39] <Yatekii> yeah, nice, ty!
[10:19:53] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: Your div was empty
[10:19:55] <Eviltwin> But something in it
[10:20:04] <Eviltwin> Put*
[10:20:21] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, it doesn't need to have anything in it, it's width 100% height 100% and fixed
[10:21:01] <especially-corn> look Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/KVGbs/18/ if the display:none is commented out, it does cover the page
[10:21:06] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: So "hide me" should show it?
[10:21:11] <Yatekii> eviltwin: now i get another error: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'b.replace')
[10:21:18] <Yatekii> on line: http://baukuenstler.wapple.ch/inc/javascripts/jquery-1.6.2.min.js
[10:21:19] <Yatekii> TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'b.replace')
[10:21:28] <especially-corn> yes Eviltwin when you press hide me it sohuld appear like it does when display:none is not there http://jsfiddle.net/KVGbs/18/
[10:25:44] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: http://jsfiddle.net/KVGbs/20/
[10:27:52] <especially-corn> thanks Eviltwin
[10:29:15] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: You should look at:http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#specificity
[10:30:07] <especially-corn> thanks Eviltwin
[10:30:42] <Yatekii> eviltwin do u know that error? :)
[10:32:15] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: It's because you didn't replace it with what I told you too :P
[10:32:45] <Eviltwin> to*
[10:32:46] <Yatekii> oh dmn sry
[10:32:50] <Yatekii> i forgot the last part
[10:32:51] <soahccc> I used jquery all over the place so noConflict could be difficult. I want to use a Prototype plugin now (because there is no one for jquery)... Is this easily possible?
[10:32:56] <Yatekii> and then just closed the brackets
[10:33:24] <Eviltwin> soahccc: Are you trying to combine the two?
[10:33:28] <Eviltwin> Lix them
[10:33:31] <Eviltwin> Mix them*
[10:33:36] <Eviltwin> Or use them separately
[10:33:54] <soahccc> Eviltwin: No I want to use a fully finished prototype plugin in my totally jquery driven app
[10:34:15] <soahccc> It is a textile WYSIWYM editor
[10:34:33] <Eviltwin> So for jQuery you can use "jQuery" and for Prototype you can use "Prototype" right?
[10:35:14] <soahccc> Eviltwin: There is a lot of jquery javascript on that page where I need the editor
[10:35:32] <Eviltwin> Is that jQuery inside a $(document).ready ?
[10:35:59] <soahccc> Eviltwin: Mostly but there is some inline code
[10:36:05] <Eviltwin> Eww
[10:36:36] <Eviltwin> If you do jQuery(document).ready(function($){...})
[10:36:36] <Yatekii> Eviltwin: very nice, works thanks!
[10:36:38] <Yatekii> TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'e.preventDefault')
[10:36:43] <Yatekii>  but i get that new error :D
[10:36:51] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: You actually had that one before
[10:36:55] <Yatekii> ye
[10:36:58] <Yatekii> i know
[10:37:00] <Yatekii> but
[10:37:02] <Yatekii> why? xD
[10:37:09] <Eviltwin> soahccc: If you do that wrapper, regardless of if there's a noConflict outside
[10:37:17] <Eviltwin> soahccc: Inside $ will mean jQuery
[10:37:24] <soahccc> Or other question: Does somebody know a textile editor for jquery? It should show what it affects
[10:37:46] <soahccc> Eviltwin: I now that but unfortunately not all of the code is wrapped in those things
[10:38:31] <black_warlock> how do i call the name of an item instead of id
[10:39:00] <black_warlock> $("#id") << i need to call the name attribute
[10:39:14] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: Just return false at the end instead
[10:39:15] <black_warlock> my item doesnt have id
[10:40:25] <kborchers> black_warlock: $("[name='theName']")
[10:40:26] <Eviltwin> black_warlock: That's the only piece of information you have?
[10:40:48] <Eviltwin> What kind of tag is it?
[10:40:56] <Eviltwin> kborchers: That's extremely slow
[10:41:04] <Eviltwin> (Or can be)
[10:41:08] <Yatekii> hÃ¶, eviltwin i dont understand that one :S
[10:41:22] <kborchers> sure it is ... just answering the question with the info provided ;)

[10:43:22] <tsutton> This should be simple.....and I'm sure it is
[10:43:24] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: "return false" from the event listener implies e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropogation()

[10:50:23] <ColKurtz> If i have a variable that references a jquery object with a selector (e.g. var visible = $("ul#panes li:visible")) how would I go about combining that variable with other selectors in a single selector?
[10:50:28] <tman-> hey
[10:50:44] <tman-> how do i get the filename attribute of the $(location).attr()
[10:50:44] <ColKurtz> so that I can select them all to fade out
[10:50:47] <tman-> does one exist?
[10:51:04] <tman-> $(location).attr('href') returns everything up to the part i want
[10:51:20] <tman-> ie,http:site.com/filename.html ... i want to extract filename from that.
[10:51:46] <ColKurtz> then use split /
[10:51:53] <ColKurtz> to split it into an array
[10:51:59] <ColKurtz> and grab the last element of the array
[10:52:05] <ColKurtz> which would be filename.html
[10:52:08] <tman-> but the return doesn't include the filename
[10:52:28] <tman-> when i do a console.log it returns up to /.. but not the actual filenam.e.. is that cos in this example i'm testing it's index.html/ ?
[10:52:31] <tman-> lemme test
[10:52:34] <ColKurtz> console.log(window.location)
[10:52:38] <ajpiano> tman-: don't use jquery on the location object, just look at console.dir( window.location )
[10:52:45] <ajpiano> and see what property will be the most useful for you to parse
[10:52:54] <ajpiano> ColKurtz: use .add to mush jquery objects together
[10:52:54] <ajpiano> ?add
[10:52:55] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[10:53:03] <ColKurtz> ty ajpiano
[10:53:23] <ColKurtz> my animated quiz book is coming together nicely
[10:53:36] <ColKurtz> the only challenge now, is that for every button pressed, an animation has to pop up
[10:53:53] <tman-> ah
[10:54:13] <ColKurtz> and if you press a second button in the same frame, then the first animation needs to be hidden, and the next one shown
[10:55:31] <ColKurtz> it's been a nice little challenge of a project
[10:55:37] <ColKurtz> i just wish the deadline wasn't so fucking short
[10:58:18] <Yatekii> eviltwin: THX VERY MUCH! all very nice
[11:01:34] <hackeron> hey, question - I have a bunch of draggable boxes and I set a high zIndex number on them, but they still appear bellow all other elements when dragged, any ideas? < this is the page: http://monitor.xanview.com/live
[11:03:09] <sphinxxx> hackeron, that usually has to do with positioning isues
[11:03:25] <Eviltwin> hackeron: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ Go to Options, scroll down to zIndex
[11:04:56] <hackeron> Eviltwin: "I set a high zIndex number on them, but they still appear bellow "
[11:06:22] <Eviltwin> hackeron: What about the z-index CSS property?
[11:08:54] <ColKurtz> what do you think would be the best way to get rid of the black halo surrounding the PNG files in IE8 on fading them out between slides? http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html
[11:09:34] <Guerrero> hello, using jquery-ui datepicker in an xhtml document I got an error on jquery.1.6.2 on line 6143... can you help me?
[11:09:52] <xcoderzach> ColKurtz: don't fade them, or don't use IE 8 :->
[11:09:55] <Eviltwin> Guerrero: That's absolutely useless to us. You need to look a the stack trace
[11:10:16] <ColKurtz> xcoderzach, like I'm the one using IE8 :P
[11:10:28] <ColKurtz> brb gonna check it out on ie9
[11:10:32] <Eviltwin> Guerrero: Use Firebug or something
[11:10:56] <Guerrero> Eviltwin: I will install it and then come back
[11:11:22] <ColKurtz> sweeet perfect
[11:11:37] <ColKurtz> most of the ad agency is on windows 7 or mac so they won't see the halo
[11:11:37] <ColKurtz> lol
[11:11:44] <ColKurtz> but the client might use ie8 D:
[11:11:48] <xcoderzach> ColKurtz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1251416/png-transparency-problems-in-ie8
[11:12:36] <xcoderzach> The first answer fixed it, however, you might have to write a custom, ie 8 only animate function :-S
[11:12:54] <ColKurtz> sweeet thanks for the link
[11:13:07] <ColKurtz> i was googling around and hadn't found anything quite as satisfactory
[11:13:31] <ColKurtz> For most cases I can apply a background color to the image and it's fixed
[11:15:00] <ColKurtz> wait lots of comments on first answer say it doesn't work
[11:15:08] <Eviltwin> StackOverflow is a good place to turn to
[11:15:20] <ColKurtz> and the PNGs are background images, not <img> tags
[11:16:51] <ColKurtz> hmm and it says I can't fade out the <div>s with background PNGs directly...I need to fade out their container element
[11:17:13] <ColKurtz> the problem is, I was fading out the container earlier
[11:17:17] <ColKurtz> (which works in FF/chrome)
[11:17:26] <ColKurtz> but the <divs> weren't being faded at all
[11:17:47] <ColKurtz> because after it fades out I move those DOM elements into the next slide
[11:18:00] <ColKurtz> so it was a wee bug
[11:18:23] <ColKurtz> now that I'm fading them out directly, they're fading, but they have the black halo
[11:18:54] <Eviltwin> Let's call this Intro to How Much IE Sucks
[11:18:59] <Eviltwin> It's a 101 class
[11:19:07] <mgoeppner> protip: wd-40 has no effect on stubborn DOM elements.
[11:21:16] <ColKurtz> I just tried out that fix in the link xcoderzach, now everything turns black and does some weird ass shit
[11:21:18] <ColKurtz> D:
[11:21:21] <Guerrero> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/5RHUmVy3 is that what you mean before? (stack)
[11:25:07] <ccmonsters> hey guys, i have an array of json objects and I want to post it to php
[11:25:12] <ccmonsters> what is the best format to post with.
[11:25:50] <ccmonsters> the normal $.post('script.php',myObj,function(){........stuff.....}) doesn't seem to do the trick.
[11:26:33] <Eviltwin> Guerrero: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide47
[11:27:50] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: $.post('script.php',JSON.stringify(myObj),function(){...})
[11:27:54] <Eviltwin> Try that
[11:29:07] <ccmonsters> hmm. shouldn't $.param() do the trick?
[11:29:33] <Eviltwin> Query params != JSON
[11:29:35] <Yatekii> guys, does someone know simply scroll?
[11:29:50] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: see ? param
[11:29:51] <bot-t> ccmonsters, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[11:30:07] <Yatekii> if i use this code: http://pastebin.com/bYechQXe
[11:30:08] <ccmonsters> ah, i need to stringify, then param
[11:30:20] <Yatekii> just the speed of scroller is changed to 4
[11:30:27] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: Uh...probably not
[11:30:27] <Yatekii> the speed of scroller1 remains 1
[11:30:32] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you're doing
[11:30:38] <Yatekii> do u know why its like its?
[11:31:16] <ccmonsters> well, i have some li's with data() attached to them, I grabbed all the data() off each element and did a rows = row.data('mydata'), and now i want to post rows
[11:31:18] <mgoeppner> ahhh people! pastebin makes my eyes bleed...
[11:31:25] <ccmonsters> eek, hopefully that made sense lol
[11:33:02] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: Have you already done some form of $("#scroller1").simplyScroll(...) ?
[11:33:28] <Yatekii> yep, the scrolling worksâ€¦just the speedchange not
[11:33:39] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: $.param(JSON.stringify(...)) does not make sense
[11:33:42] <Yatekii> or what u mean?
[11:33:42] <Eviltwin> You know that, right?
[11:33:48] <Yatekii> maybe code-overwriting?
[11:33:59] <ccmonsters> yea, it doesn't. was getting ahead of myself
[11:34:08] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: you just need to do $.post("whatever", { rows: JSON.stringify(rows) }, fn);
[11:34:10] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: I mean it looks like $("#scroller1").simplyScroll({...}) and another $("#scroller1").simplyScroll({...}) later will fuck things up
[11:34:16] <ajpiano> and on your backend json_decode the rows
[11:34:23] <ccmonsters> yea.
[11:34:35] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: Unless your backend is expecting only JSON
[11:34:37] <Yatekii> evil, no i just have that ajax.js
[11:34:44] <Yatekii> i dont have any other scripts
[11:34:54] <Eviltwin> Like if you were reading from php://input in PHP
[11:34:55] <Yatekii> there is no other creating of the simplyscroll
[11:35:30] <ccmonsters> $.post('php/csv_output.php','{ rows:' + data + "}",function(response) {});
[11:35:45] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: no, why would you do that
[11:36:18] <ccmonsters> let me show what i have.
[11:36:20] <ajpiano> i mean, unless that's what you wanted
[11:36:21] <ajpiano> please don't
[11:36:40] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible for a disabled textarea to react to a click event? i have some default text that I enable/disable and set disabled at the same time, so it doesnt get submitted with the form
[11:36:42] <ajpiano> i'm pretty sure what you want is to get a $_POST var called rows
[11:36:44] <ccmonsters> not in here. lol
[11:36:54] <ajpiano> that will have json init that you can decode
[11:36:58] <ajpiano> definitely not in PM
[11:37:02] <ajpiano> i don't want to know *more* about this
[11:37:09] <ajpiano> you should have the tools to be able to send the json now
[11:37:19] <ajpiano> as serialized json, and decode it on the backend as necessary
[11:38:02] <ccmonsters> http://pastie.org/2945660
[11:38:20] <ccmonsters> lol, not a pm or anything.
[11:38:25] <Yatekii> anyone got a plan?
[11:38:40] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: do you not understand the concept here?
[11:38:43] <amirite> foo
[11:38:45] <ajpiano> you get the serialized string of json
[11:38:50] <ajpiano> and then post it as a single parameter
[11:38:53] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: You should fix simplyScroll
[11:38:55] <danzik17> ajpiano: do you know of any way to "pause" or otherwise defer the execution of an ajax request in a prefilter?
[11:38:55] <Eviltwin> That's the plan
[11:39:12] <Yatekii> yeh, but how? oO
[11:39:19] <ajpiano> like { foo: JSON.stringify(rows) }
[11:39:23] <Yatekii> if i dont know whats wrong :S
[11:39:23] <ajpiano> danzik17: nope
[11:39:44] <danzik17> damn :(
[11:39:58] <tomasm-> is there an easy way to take create a textarea that will take on the exact size and position of another one (with a different z-index)? maybe an easy way to position it over via jquery
[11:40:01] <ccmonsters> then what is wrong with :  $.post('php/csv_output.php','{ rows:' + data + "}",fn);
[11:40:14] <ccmonsters> if the data is JSON.stringify() already
[11:40:22] <ajpiano> danzik17: i mean, you could try something like, caching all the options, and then setting a beforeSend or something else that aborts the xhr
[11:40:33] <Eviltwin> Yatekii: The problem is you're using what looks like a poorly-designed plugin
[11:40:36] <mgoeppner> ccmonsters: now it just seems like you are going in circles...
[11:40:37] <ajpiano> and stick the cached ajax options somewhere else and then eventually make a new request using that
[11:40:53] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: you won't be able to access that on the backend
[11:41:04] <ajpiano> you won't have a $_POST['rows'] or whatnot
[11:41:10] <ccmonsters> mgoeppner, i hear ya.
[11:41:11] <ajpiano> or at least, i don't think you will
[11:41:16] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: But he could get it from php://input
[11:41:20] <ccmonsters> i thnk you are probably right.
[11:41:28] <ccmonsters> this isn't a php page, im trying to post to a seperate php script
[11:41:29] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Which is the "proper" way to do a JSON API
[11:41:30] <danzik17> ajpiano: yea i thought about that, but the problem with that is that i can't get at any callbacks that were attached using the Deferred methods, only the internal success, error, etc...
[11:41:37] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: yeah, i don't know
[11:41:49] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: How is this separate PHP script trying to access this data?
[11:41:56] <ccmonsters> I was going to post to it.
[11:42:06] <Yatekii> eviltwin, u got  a better one?? maybe one with looping? not just left or right?
[11:42:08] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: also it's insane to take some JS data, stringify it, and then manually insert the stuff you stringified into another "json string"
[11:42:18] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: PHP end, how is it attempting to access this data?
[11:42:56] <ccmonsters> with your normal $.POST['var']
[11:43:04] <ajpiano> ccmonsters: so tell you what
[11:43:06] <ajpiano> try it both ways
[11:43:19] <ajpiano> one with { foo: JSON.stringify(rows) }
[11:43:30] <ajpiano> and then json_decode($_POST['foo'])
[11:43:31] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: Then what you actually need to send to the server is var={...encoded data...}
[11:43:31] <ajpiano> on php
[11:43:50] <ajpiano> and then try it your broken way and realise for yourself that there is no post param and that it's broken
[11:43:57] <ajpiano> we don't need to explain this 7 times
[11:43:59] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: As a string $.param({"var": JSON.stringify(object)})
[11:44:18] <ccmonsters> well that makes sense right there.
[11:44:19] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: he doesn't have to $.param it
[11:44:43] <ccmonsters> two different things were going on here, and I think I was confusing you two and signals were crossing.
[11:44:53] <ccmonsters> because like mgoeppner said, this was feeling circular lol
[11:45:16] <ajpiano> yeah i was getting the "feeling" that i wanted to stick my head into a "circular" saw
[11:45:17] <ajpiano> :/
[11:45:29] <ccmonsters> unhuh. i see.
[11:45:34] <ajpiano> :D
[11:45:38] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: So if the object was {a: {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}, b: [1, 2, 3]}
[11:45:51] <Eviltwin> That gets JSON encoded to a string as {"a":{"one":1,"two":2,"three":3},"b":[1,2,3]}
[11:45:57] <ccmonsters> yea....
[11:46:12] <Eviltwin> Then in order for the server to find that at $_POST['var']
[11:46:31] <Eviltwin> It needs to be encoded as a query param for var=[encoded version of that string]
[11:46:36] <ccmonsters> yea.
[11:46:39] <Eviltwin> Which actually looks like this: var=%7B%22a%22%3A%7B%22one%22%3A1%2C%22two%22%3A2%2C%22three%22%3A3%7D%2C%22b%22%3A%5B1%2C2%2C3%5D%7D
[11:46:58] <ccmonsters> yeap
[11:47:06] <ccmonsters> I get all that.
[11:47:07] <Eviltwin> Generated via $.param({var: JSON.stringify({a: {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}, b: [1, 2, 3]})})
[11:47:16] <ccmonsters> yeap.
[11:47:25] <Eviltwin> When you pass data to jQuery's AJAX (and related methods)
[11:47:32] <Eviltwin> If the data is not a string
[11:47:37] <Eviltwin> There's an implied $.param
[11:47:45] <Eviltwin> If it is a string, it's just sent directly
[11:48:00] <mgoeppner> couldn't you just set $.ajax 's dataType to json, and pass the object directly as data? ccmonsters
[11:48:31] <Eviltwin> So if you pass in "{var: "+JSON.stringify(...)+"}", that actually sends '{var: {"a":{"one":1,"two":2,"three":3},"b":[1,2,3]}}'
[11:48:44] <ajpiano> mgoeppner: dataType determines what jQuery does with the response, not what the server does with the data
[11:48:45] <Eviltwin> mcluskydodallas: dataType is the expected *return* type
[11:49:05] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: So you see "{var: "+JSON.stringify(...)+"}" is definitely wrong
[11:49:14] <Eviltwin> As it doesn't produce that URL encoding PHP's expecting
[11:49:30] <ccmonsters> yea. its not encoded.
[11:49:34] <catcher> Can I use nth-child with find?
[11:49:38] <ccmonsters> that's all that had to be said earlier and i would have had you.
[11:49:43] <ccmonsters> :)
[11:49:49] <mgoeppner> ajpiano: Eviltwin I thought i read something along those lines once... My brain must be lieing to me :P
[11:50:46] <ccmonsters> so Eviltwin , this looks better? http://pastie.org/2945660
[11:51:13] <minna> Halloj you guys!! :-D
[11:51:21] <ccmonsters> hallo, wie gehts
[11:51:31] <minna> Sehr gut mein herren
[11:51:53] <minna> Whie gehts es?
[11:51:59] <minna> Geesh, my german is not good.
[11:52:28] * soahccc is a german pro... A grade :P
[11:52:34] <ccmonsters> ich auch
[11:52:56] * soahccc and a english intermediate :S
[11:53:09] <minna> Maybe you'r from germany then ;)
[11:53:15] <minna> Im swede
[11:53:23] <soahccc> Yeah I am =)
[11:53:36] <minna> Anyone of you guys know why IE8 shots out console is not defined?
[11:53:56] <soahccc> I've got british roots but my english isn't that good as it should be I guess
[11:54:23] <minna> soahccc: no worries, i can still understand you and thats the most important :)
[11:55:27] <soahccc> so true
[11:58:30] <keybo> xvbgcfh#
[12:01:00] <ColKurtz> what's the keyword for medium duration in animate
[12:01:03] <ColKurtz> 'normal' ?
[12:01:16] <minna> Try it :)
[12:01:51] <Eviltwin> ccmonsters: Close here: http://pastie.org/2945660
[12:02:13] <Eviltwin> You actually would need $.param({rows: JSON.stringify(data)})
[12:02:18] <Eviltwin> The {}'s are important
[12:02:39] <Eviltwin> But if you pass {rows: JSON.stringify(data)} as the data directly, jQuery will automatically $.param it for you
[12:02:56] <ColKurtz> meh
[12:03:00] <ColKurtz> i give up on those evil black halos
[12:03:08] <ColKurtz> the situation is too complex
[12:03:15] <ColKurtz> there's no way they were going anywhere
[12:03:34] <Eviltwin> catcher: Sure why not
[12:03:56] <Eviltwin> minna: Because console isn't defined in IE
[12:04:03] <Eviltwin> It didn't have a console
[12:04:09] <Eviltwin> Because Microsoft is an asshole
[12:04:13] <minna> Eviltwin: Ah, makes sense.
[12:04:22] <minna> Eviltwin: Yes, yes they are very much so.
[12:04:43] <ColKurtz> yeah
[12:04:45] <ColKurtz> console isn't defined
[12:04:51] <ColKurtz> until you open it up
[12:04:52] <ColKurtz> D:
[12:05:03] <ColKurtz> f12->console
[12:05:13] <minna> There is a console in IE8??!
[12:05:19] <Eviltwin> Oh shit, I wrote a nify plugin in an anoymous gist yesterday
[12:05:19] <ColKurtz> yeah
[12:05:24] <ColKurtz> f12->console
[12:05:29] <minna> Holy shit
[12:05:32] <minna> look at that :)
[12:05:39] <ColKurtz> using console.log broke a script for me in firefox too
[12:05:39] <Eviltwin> I have no idea what it was called
[12:05:48] <ColKurtz> i don't knwo if it was bc it didn't have firebug installed, or if it was an older version
[12:05:54] <Eviltwin> catcher: Yup, Firefox doesn't define it either
[12:05:56] <Eviltwin> Firebug does
[12:06:04] <ColKurtz> my boss is gone, maybe i should secretly update his firefox
[12:06:05] <ColKurtz> lol
[12:06:10] <Eviltwin> Really there shouldn't be anything console.* in production code
[12:06:26] <Eviltwin> Unless explicitly enabled perhaps
[12:06:35] <Eviltwin> Which is why we built a kill switch
[12:06:47] <bodisiw> hi, is there any way to distinguish between a scroll event that was invoked as part of animate scrollTop and a manually invoked user scroll e.g. with the mousewheel?
[12:07:10] <catcher> cool, ty
[12:07:28] <ColKurtz> bodisiw, maybe you could trigger a custom event when you animate
[12:08:31] <bodisiw> ColKurtz, well the situation is more like i want it to be constantly scrolling automatically _unless_ there is some user intervention to try to scroll it, then pause the automatic
[12:08:43] <ColKurtz> ah
[12:09:38] <ColKurtz> bodisiw, surely searching "jquery auto scroll" will net you some code or plugins to look at
[12:10:13] <bodisiw> thanks
[12:12:53] <tomasm-> if I call $('textarea').clone(), will it be identical in content, width, height, position, etc css?
[12:13:08] <yan_nick> hey guys, why this always return FALSE? var foo = ["basic_page"]; console.log('basic_page' in foo);
[12:13:16] <yan_nick> how can i check whether "basic_page" is in foo?
[12:14:34] <ajpiano> ?inArray @ yan_nick
[12:14:34] <bot-t> yan_nick, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[12:14:41] <ajpiano> 'in' is for objects, not arrays, yan_nick
[12:14:47] <yan_nick> oh
[12:14:56] <yan_nick> ajpiano++
[12:15:53] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: It will copy the element and its contents
[12:16:01] <Eviltwin> Including its properties like style
[12:16:16] <yan_nick> ajpiano: wtf? 0 and -1? why not as boolean?
[12:16:18] <yan_nick> 0 and 1
[12:16:31] <ColKurtz> Is there anyway to tell if a variable's string content has the same value as the name of a function, and if so, execute that function?
[12:16:32] <Eviltwin> Index in the array
[12:16:36] <ajpiano> yan_nick: because it tells you where in the array the item is found
[12:16:45] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, so if I clone() an item and then hide the original, then append the clone after the original, will the thing look the same?
[12:16:47] <yan_nick> ajpiano: ah see it
[12:16:48] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: To make it a boolean, use $.inArray(...) >= 0
[12:17:06] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Should
[12:17:12] <Eviltwin> Do you have any .data() on it?
[12:17:20] <Eviltwin> Or jQuery UI stuff?
[12:17:28] <Eviltwin> Or other plugins
[12:17:34] <Eviltwin> Or widgets
[12:17:38] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, no just an ordinary textarea.... trying to create a ghostable item without affecting original content
[12:18:07] <Eviltwin> Then .clone() should work just fne
[12:18:12] <Eviltwin> fine*
[12:18:16] <Eviltwin> This internet is really shitty
[12:19:06] <rue> Tried internet2?
[12:19:16] <svcghost> Hi I am using jQuery to, upon load of the page, resize a textbox depending on how wide the browser window is. I am wondering if there is any way to make it so the textbox resizes instantly, and doesn't have to wait for the page to load because it may take seconds.
[12:20:00] <Eviltwin> svcghost: This is the difference between $(window).load and $(document).ready
[12:20:17] <Eviltwin> You should be able to do this at $(document).ready
[12:20:26] <Eviltwin> Which happens before imagesetc  load
[12:22:14] <Eviltwin> Ha ha, love the comments in this, ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/wq376/
[12:22:43] <ajpiano> i love the data :DD
[12:23:30] <tomasm-> "shonn".... nice.
[12:23:53] <jayd3e> you guys have any neat tricks in dealing with tabular data, i.e. I need to replace the value in column 2 for a specific key found in column 1
[12:23:58] <tman-> does anyone happen to know the keycode for the +/=  key ?
[12:24:10] <jayblanchard> ajpiano but it's da Jets
[12:24:11] <svcghost> awesome thanks Eviltwin :)
[12:24:18] <tomasm-> tman-, google for ascii keycodes
[12:24:28] <Eviltwin> jayd3e: You're going to have to search and find it but that's not too bad
[12:24:38] <ajpiano> jayblanchard: exactly
[12:24:43] <tman-> yea
[12:24:44] <tman-> i did
[12:24:57] <tman-> none of them work, i'm thinking it might vary between browsers.
[12:25:14] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: $(window).keypress(function(e){console.log(e.keyCode)})
[12:25:17] <tman-> ill just get the console to tell me
[12:25:18] <Eviltwin> Then press the keys
[12:25:18] <tman-> uea
[12:25:19] <Eviltwin> Congrats!
[12:25:29] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[12:25:29] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:25:47] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, not me, tman-
[12:25:48] <jayd3e> Eviltwin: search for what exactly?  I half-assumed that jquery has accounted for such a usecase, potentially, so I thought I would ask, I could always do it the manual way tho
[12:26:12] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: I tab completed t*- and assumed there would only be one
[12:26:15] <Eviltwin> My bad
[12:27:16] <tman-> nice .. console.log = god.
[12:27:29] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, all i get is '0', for anything I press
[12:27:48] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you need a new keyboard
[12:28:12] <tomasm-> ok..... :-|
[12:28:58] <jayd3e> Eviltwin: o ic what you meant, search through column 1 and find that row, then replace column 2
[12:29:05] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:29:18] <jayd3e> Eviltwin: misunderstood, thought you meant like search the interwebs
[12:30:44] <Eviltwin> jayd3e: http://jsfiddle.net/q5hem/
[12:33:37] <jaffipaffi> Why does this code call addtobasket.php twice? http://pastebin.com/JTnAzYSC
[12:33:49] <jaffipaffi> It fades two objects that has the class cartfade
[12:33:54] <jayd3e> Eviltwin: thnx man
[12:34:39] <darcyclarke> jaffipaffi you answered your own question.. you have two elements that you bind that animation and subsequent callback too... thus, you call that $.post twice
[12:35:06] <jaffipaffi> darcyclarke: That's what I thought.. So the question is really: how do I prevent it from posting twice?
[12:36:24] <jaffipaffi> Could of course just wrap a div around it
[12:36:29] <jaffipaffi> And call that instead
[12:36:38] <ProLoser|Work> what would be a more elegant approach to this? var x = (arr1.length && arr2.length && true) || false
[12:36:44] <Eviltwin> jayd3e: If they occupy the same space, then yet
[12:36:52] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: What's your goal?
[12:37:34] <ProLoser|Work> boolean
[12:38:01] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Can length be negative?
[12:38:01] <darcyclarke> jaffipaffi use deffereds http://vimeo.com/22687950
[12:39:37] <jaffipaffi> darcyclarke: Could work...
[12:40:33] <Eviltwin> jaffipaffi: http://jsfiddle.net/mf9FA/
[12:40:41] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: no
[12:40:49] <ColKurtz> oh what to eat what to eat
[12:40:51] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: And why do you need a boolean?
[12:40:55] <ColKurtz> philly cheesesteak accross the street?
[12:41:08] <ColKurtz> i wonder what kind of soup they have at the place in my building today...
[12:41:09] <jaffipaffi> Thanks Eviltwin. :)
[12:41:24] <Eviltwin> jaffipaffi: It was adapted for jsFiddle
[12:41:28] <Eviltwin> Note it's posting to /echo/html
[12:41:37] <Eviltwin> Just to demonstrate what's happening
[12:41:59] <jaffipaffi> Yep, I see
[12:42:10] <jaffipaffi> The reason why I used eval is pretty strange
[12:42:16] <Eviltwin> And what is that?
[12:42:37] <jaffipaffi> In my addtobasket.php file i had something like this: <script type="text/javascript">$('#something').toggle();</script>
[12:42:39] <jaffipaffi> Just for example
[12:42:47] <jaffipaffi> And put the data into a buffer div
[12:42:49] <jaffipaffi> But
[12:42:57] <jaffipaffi> After 4-5-6 clicks
[12:43:06] <ProLoser|Work> Eviltwin: i hear a lot that i shouldn't rely on implicit casting
[12:43:09] <jaffipaffi> The javascript is no longer parsed? even though it's put into the buffer?
[12:43:20] <jaffipaffi> So, I changed the addtobasket.php file to return just $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#something').toggle();
[12:43:23] <jaffipaffi> And then eval'ed the data
[12:43:26] <atkrad> less
[12:43:31] <jaffipaffi> And it works on all clicks
[12:43:37] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: It's not really casting
[12:43:47] <zulax> if i do var f = "g"; and again later do var f ="sd"; will my declaring var twice break the code?
[12:43:52] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to remove a remove a class, and then add a class. I'm using the ability to use a callback from within removeClass. But the callback isn't firing. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/UVCUn/
[12:43:55] <Eviltwin> But the easiest way to make a truthy x true or a falsey x false is to use !!x
[12:44:01] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!"barn"
[12:44:03] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[12:44:05] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!0
[12:44:06] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[12:44:08] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!null
[12:44:09] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[12:44:11] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!12
[12:44:12] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[12:44:31] <Eviltwin> zulax: Are they in the same function?
[12:44:50] <aaronmcadam> ProLoser|Work: you absolutely should depend on type coericon
[12:44:55] <aaronmcadam> coercion even
[12:45:09] <jaffipaffi> Eviltwin: So if there would be a solution on that, I would of course not use eval
[12:45:35] <aaronmcadam> zulax if defined in different scopes, but it breaks readability really
[12:45:37] <zulax> Eviltwin, on one big js file, not a function though
[12:45:49] <aaronmcadam> it won't *break* it zulax
[12:45:53] <zulax> thanks
[12:45:59] <aaronmcadam> it's just not the done thing
[12:46:04] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: .removeClass callback doesn't work that way
[12:46:16] <aaronmcadam> var x; x = "overwriting x rather than redefining it"
[12:46:16] <ColKurtz> if (typeof action == 'string' && eval('typeof ' + action) == 'function') {
[12:46:16] <ColKurtz> 				eval(action+'()');
[12:46:16] <ColKurtz> 			}
[12:46:16] <Eviltwin> .removeClass is synchronous
[12:46:18] <ColKurtz> :D
[12:46:18] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: You know, I've just worked that out.
[12:46:30] <aaronmcadam> yuuuuck
[12:46:48] <bobdobbs>  I mean, I took a closer look at the docs, and saw that the callback isn't designed that way.
[12:46:51] <pojo_> hi http://jsfiddle.net/vivektikoo/2g7Ln/12/
[12:47:30] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: what does it mean that
[12:47:44] <bobdobbs> ...sorry, keyboard issues...
[12:48:07] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: What do you mean when you say that "removeClass is synchronous"?
[12:48:11] <pojo_> http://jsfiddle.net/vivektikoo/2g7Ln/12/ button click not generated only input change called
[12:48:23] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: I mean you don't need to use a callback to wait for it to happen
[12:48:30] <Eviltwin> When the function returns, the class has been removed
[12:48:52] <bobdobbs> ok
[12:48:53] <bobdobbs> thanks
[12:49:00] <aaronmcadam> that's nice

[12:51:55] <chrisvwebdev> hello all.
[12:53:03] <chrisvwebdev> i have a wrapped set with and html string in each element.  when i invoke .each(), i want to use a function in each to add a break <br> in the last space within the strinng.  any ideas?
[12:53:21] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle
[12:54:04] <bobdobbs> Just on the off-chance... has anyone ported the jquery docs to the linux man format
[12:54:05] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ chrisvwebdev
[12:54:06] <bot-t> chrisvwebdev, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:54:10] <aaronmcadam> ha!
[12:54:12] <aaronmcadam> what an idea
[12:54:30] <aaronmcadam> I've never heard of *any* project doing that
[12:54:43] <pojo_> aaronmcadam
[12:54:45] * aaronmcadam tries man python
[12:55:08] <aaronmcadam> ah well yeah that's for the bin
[12:55:31] <aaronmcadam> that's my name
[12:55:36] <pojo_> aaronmcadam did u see that xample
[12:55:38] <bobdobbs> well, it would save me from switching from the terminal to the browser
[12:55:45] <aaronmcadam> i didn't look at it
[12:55:49] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[12:55:53] <aaronmcadam> you work in vim bobdobbs
[12:55:54] <aaronmcadam> ?
[12:55:57] <bobdobbs> emacs
[12:56:04] * bobdobbs ducks
[12:56:04] <aaronmcadam> nooo hehe only kiddin
[12:56:20] <aaronmcadam> emacs would be alright if I'd learned it at uni
[12:56:31] <aaronmcadam> learning vim has proven to be easier but I digress
[12:56:33] <bobdobbs> I guess I was just wondering, cos someone did the same thing for the php docs
[12:56:38] <aaronmcadam> they did? nice
[12:56:42] <aaronmcadam> can u pipe in commands?
[12:57:00] <bobdobbs> I'm not sure. I've never tried doing anything fancy
[12:57:04] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[12:57:07] <aaronmcadam> I think "man jquery"
[12:57:11] <bobdobbs> yeah
[12:57:15] <bobdobbs> that'd be cool
[12:57:16] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to add a dummy bin
[12:57:26] <aaronmcadam> cuz man commands work on actual programs
[12:57:28] <bobdobbs> or 'man jquery removeClass'
[12:57:38] <aaronmcadam> maybe a dummy bin that just wgets the api
[12:57:42] <aaronmcadam> and parses the xml
[12:57:49] <bobdobbs> maybe 'jman'
[12:57:53] <aaronmcadam> the overhead might be a bit mad
[12:57:55] <bobdobbs> hehe
[12:58:02] <bobdobbs> with php, it's 'pman'
[12:58:05] <aaronmcadam> right
[12:58:13] <aaronmcadam> so you could have it download the xml, easy
[12:58:22] <aaronmcadam> and then pipe your command name into an xslt
[12:58:24] <aaronmcadam> that would work
[12:58:27] <Eviltwin> chrisvwebdev: Did you make a jsFiddle example?
[12:58:45] <aaronmcadam> you could do it in a bash script
[12:58:50] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[12:58:53] <aaronmcadam> or with zsh
[12:58:56] <aaronmcadam> use ruby
[12:59:00] <aaronmcadam> or python
[12:59:14] <Eviltwin> pojo_: This is not jQuery
[12:59:14] <aaronmcadam> use a python processor like lxml
[12:59:24] <aaronmcadam> what *is* it?
[12:59:26] <bobdobbs> If my kung fu was anywhere near good enough, I'd give it a shot myseld
[12:59:37] <aaronmcadam> I'm just thinking that's how you could do it
[12:59:55] <aaronmcadam> I meant to do something myself to list all the functions which return jQuery
[13:00:03] <aaronmcadam> i.e. a list of chainable methods
[13:00:18] <Eviltwin> pojo_: http://jsfiddle.net/2g7Ln/16/
[13:00:35] <bobdobbs> aaronmcadam: feel free to share if you do do that :)
[13:00:55] <erichynds> aaronmcadam: Object.keys($.fn);
[13:00:56] <aaronmcadam> it won't be that difficult
[13:00:59] <bobdobbs> I bet the API docs are available in some kind of portable format
[13:01:04] <aaronmcadam> xml bobdobbs
[13:01:10] <bobdobbs> cool
[13:01:11] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: I have had lots of weird issues with lxml
[13:01:21] <aaronmcadam> what sort?
[13:01:23] <aaronmcadam> with xslt?
[13:01:30] <Eviltwin> With lxml.html
[13:01:40] <aaronmcadam> go on?
[13:01:44] <Eviltwin> I had <table><tbody></tbody></table> or something like that
[13:01:46] <Eviltwin> Parsed it
[13:01:47] <aaronmcadam> all I want to use it for is xslt
[13:01:49] <Eviltwin> Stringified
[13:01:52] <innociv> Fffffffffffucking tinymce is a pain.
[13:01:55] <aaronmcadam> haha
[13:01:57] <jayblanchard> chriswebdev like this http://jsfiddle.net/GWhWs/ ?
[13:01:58] <Eviltwin> Somehow ended up with <table><tbody></tbody><tbody></tbody></table>
[13:01:59] <aaronmcadam> ckeditor pisses all over it
[13:02:00] <bobdobbs> aaronmcadam: google tells me that there is something called 'xmltoman'
[13:02:07] <aaronmcadam> ooh
[13:02:12] <innociv> Does it? Does it have good jquery support?
[13:02:20] <aaronmcadam> um
[13:02:24] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs
[13:02:24] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[13:02:26] <innociv> When you want to do heavy ajax with tinymce, it makes you want to rip your hair out.
[13:02:30] <innociv> I know but.
[13:02:38] <aaronmcadam> tinymce is ancient shit
[13:02:39] <innociv> The whole "best practices" stuff.
[13:02:41] <aaronmcadam> the code is horrible
[13:02:47] <pojo_> yeah eviltwin change some thing in input box and click done only change event called
[13:02:50] <aaronmcadam> ckeditor was completely rewritten last year
[13:03:01] <innociv> Wait. I tried using ckeditor before. It didn't work out, iirc. :(
[13:03:08] <aaronmcadam> nice bobdobbs!
[13:03:26] <Eviltwin> pojo_: No, it's not
[13:03:30] <Eviltwin> They are both called
[13:03:32] <bobdobbs> aaronmcadam: I'm going to give it a shot at transforming the docs to man pages
[13:03:39] <danzik17> aaronmcadam: +1, but eh, none of the editors are all that great imo
[13:03:43] <aaronmcadam> is it in the repos?
[13:03:45] <aaronmcadam> looks like it
[13:03:52] <aaronmcadam> bobdobbs: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/xmltoman.1.html
[13:03:56] <bobdobbs> yeah - I just installed it with apt-get :)
[13:04:01] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Shouldn't be too hard to automate, yeah

[13:04:48] <bobdobbs> ta :)
[13:04:54] <aaronmcadam> bobdobbs: use this chrome extension to view the xml, formats it beautifully: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eeocglpgjdpaefaedpblffpeebgmgddk
[13:05:02] <Dave_Stein> any idea why var slice = [].slice, args = slice.call( arguments ), pass = args.splice(1); would fail in IE8?
[13:05:13] <pojo_> yeah eviltwin change some thing in input box and click done only change event called
[13:05:31] <aaronmcadam> args doesn't have a splice method?
[13:05:39] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[13:05:41] <aaronmcadam> hang on ok
[13:05:50] <Dave_Stein> yeah im about to make a fiddle now that i think of it

[13:06:04] <aaronmcadam> hey btw Dave_Stein
[13:06:05] <aaronmcadam> :)
[13:06:24] <Dave_Stein> ya?
[13:07:00] <Dave_Stein> oh jsfiddle why are you being so slow
[13:07:02] <aaronmcadam> just sayin hi dude
[13:07:07] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle is always slow
[13:07:12] <aaronmcadam> the beta will never come :(
[13:07:19] <ibike365> hey all
[13:07:25] <aaronmcadam> I'm willing to even pay for it at this stage
[13:07:25] <Dave_Stein> not alwayssss
[13:07:28] <Dave_Stein> i told him that too
[13:07:42] <Eviltwin> pojo_: Type something, click out of the field but not the button
[13:07:45] <Eviltwin> Then click the button
[13:07:47] <aaronmcadam> i wouldn't mind say $8 a month or even a bit more
[13:08:01] <Eviltwin> I wouldn't pay that much
[13:08:12] <ibike365> just got here... pay for what?
[13:08:17] <aaronmcadam> and a large chunk of the dev community are using it now
[13:08:20] <Eviltwin> I'd do maybe a $20 one time and then maybe like $1-3/month
[13:08:24] <dogarrhea2> any way to save a jsfiddle permanently? tired of starting over
[13:08:32] <aaronmcadam> course there is
[13:08:36] <aaronmcadam> sign up for an account..
[13:08:44] <aaronmcadam> and then u can fork fiddles n all sorts
[13:09:06] <Eviltwin> I have some from like 6 months ago
[13:09:18] <aaronmcadam> anyway Dave_Stein where's the blog post on your framework eh eh ;) :D
[13:09:58] <Dave_Stein> a) im about to hop into a meeting
[13:10:06] <Dave_Stein> b) i need to do another blog post on another component or two first
[13:10:07] <Dave_Stein> ttyl :D

[13:10:30] <aaronmcadam> hehe cya dude
[13:10:32] <bobdobbs> aaronmcadam: iteration one done... api transformed to one big single man page. Of course, that's not quiet what we want...
[13:10:53] <dogarrhea2> oh it is slow
[13:10:55] <pojo_> Eviltwin how will user know it
[13:11:08] <aaronmcadam> hmmmm
[13:11:51] <aaronmcadam> man I'm really tired of Google's SSO
[13:12:06] <aaronmcadam> pain in the arse switching browsers to sign in as a diff user
[13:12:08] <Eviltwin> pojo_: The user doesn't really have much to do with event listeners now does it?
[13:12:48] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[13:13:45] <dogarrhea2> what's the strategy to clone an array of elements?  do some each function where the ids are changed and then clone after the id is changed?
[13:14:36] <aaronmcadam> you'd use a map for that but
[13:15:09] <aaronmcadam> or use underscore

[13:18:57] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: One solution: http://jsfiddle.net/jKexj/
[13:19:28] <aaronmcadam> ah he meant a wrapped set
[13:20:06] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn't need that
[13:20:32] <DobreJoe> how do I select all inputs with name="item_name_x" where X can be any positive integer?
[13:20:43] <Eviltwin> Oh, I assumed he wanted deep
[13:20:50] <martndemus> with a regular expression?
[13:20:55] <Eviltwin> elements within elements
[13:20:55] <dogarrhea2> in your experience, do elements have the same event listeners after you clone them?
[13:21:07] <aaronmcadam> DobreJoe: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[13:21:21] <aaronmcadam> you need a special method for that
[13:21:21] <Eviltwin> DobreJoe: Then filter it down if necessary
[13:21:26] <aaronmcadam> or else use event delegation dogarrhea2
[13:21:35] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: If you .clone() them they will certainly not
[13:21:42] <aaronmcadam> you can pass
[13:21:45] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: If you .clone(true) them they certainly will :P
[13:21:45] <aaronmcadam> a true
[13:21:48] <ibike365> DobreJoe $("[name^='item_name']")
[13:21:53] <aaronmcadam> but it's best to use event delegation
[13:22:09] <DobreJoe> ibike365 tnx
[13:22:12] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: *TOTALLY* depends on the use case
[13:22:12] <aaronmcadam> rather than passing a param in there that you might miss out on
[13:22:18] <aaronmcadam> I don't think so
[13:22:35] <thebignoise> is there a way to convert charCode to its corresponding letter
[13:22:37] <aaronmcadam> if you're adding new DOM elements, you should be using delegation
[13:23:18] <aaronmcadam> right, it pulls in from the jQuery data prop
[13:23:49] <erichynds> ?mdc fromCharCode @ thebignoise
[13:23:50] <bot-t> thebignoise, fromCharCode - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode values. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[13:23:52] <ibike365> So, I'm playing with some CSS3 transforms - triggering with click. Working, but only on first time I click my button. http://jsfiddle.net/bv74z/ Anyone know why?
[13:24:12] <aaronmcadam> ooh
[13:24:45] <thebignoise> sweet! thanx a bunch erichynds

[13:25:18] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/97jUn/
[13:25:31] <innociv> How can I see how html is changed, like how change() does on textareas and such? :/
[13:25:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah so?
[13:25:49] <Eviltwin> innociv: Yes
[13:25:51] <innociv> when html is changed*
[13:26:03] <aaronmcadam> it's really best practice that if the dom is changing, use delegation that's all
[13:26:22] <ibike365> innociv do you have any example?
[13:26:23] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: And I'll say it again, it TOTALLY depends on the use case
[13:26:25] <aaronmcadam> unless you've got guys who know the api and understand why
[13:26:33] <aaronmcadam> you don't need the caps
[13:26:49] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: In this case, I've bound a listener to a particular field
[13:26:56] <Eviltwin> Now I want to copy that field and the listener somewhere else
[13:27:11] <aaronmcadam> right
[13:27:19] <Eviltwin> I don't have a class or anything on the field (I shouldn't have to)
[13:27:29] <Eviltwin> But I want both of them to trigger
[13:27:34] <aaronmcadam> right yeah i get u
[13:27:47] <innociv> Well I'm trying to see when things are written in tinyMCE.  Long story short, I can't use tinyMCE's onchange function calling.  TinyMCE doesn't actually update the textarea it's spawned off of in real time, and all the editing is done in a contenteditable="true".
[13:27:49] <Eviltwin> So don't just generalize like that
[13:27:56] <aaronmcadam> it's easier to
[13:28:03] <innociv> So I need something like changE() on the contenteditable="true" element. :|
[13:28:04] <Eviltwin> Okay, do this with delegate
[13:28:10] <aaronmcadam> it's a lot easier to explain to people
[13:28:11] <Eviltwin> Without changing the HTML
[13:28:20] <aaronmcadam> well actually it is just as hard hah
[13:28:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah well I'd structure it differently anyways
[13:28:45] <innociv> delegate?
[13:28:50] <ibike365> you can check the value of that element on keypress?
[13:28:50] <aaronmcadam> I'd classify my events
[13:29:01] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: What do you mean?
[13:29:03] <aaronmcadam> but meh
[13:29:10] <bobdobbs> aaronmcadam: ok - I put a requst through to the guy who manages the jquery API documentation for a man version
[13:29:16] <Eviltwin> Use a class for the inputs?
[13:29:17] <aaronmcadam> haha nice
[13:29:20] <aaronmcadam> good luck with that :D
[13:29:27] <ibike365> innociv can you check the value of that element on keypress?
[13:29:38] <aaronmcadam> yeah Eviltwin
[13:29:43] <aaronmcadam> and refactor it
[13:29:50] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: But I shouldn't need to do that
[13:29:55] <aaronmcadam> out to a function that sets the callback
[13:29:55] <innociv> ibike, that's what i was just about to try
[13:30:03] <aaronmcadam> yeh but you're coupling
[13:30:07] <aaronmcadam> that's why
[13:30:14] <Eviltwin> I shouldn't be required to put a unique class on an input because I want it to have a certain behavior
[13:30:18] <ibike365> innociv that's what I'd try first
[13:30:24] <Eviltwin> That totally defeats the purpose
[13:30:27] <aaronmcadam> ...
[13:30:44] <aaronmcadam> I'm coming from a writing maintainable code aspect
[13:30:49] <aaronmcadam> writing to refactor
[13:30:55] <aaronmcadam> I get your use case of course
[13:31:05] <aaronmcadam> but if you're reusing events, it should be obvious
[13:31:08] <innociv> That will probably work, except for when someone clicks undo and such. :/
[13:32:07] <innociv> Hm. No. Keyup doesn't seem to work here.
[13:32:08] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: So you're saying cloning event handlers is unmaintainable?
[13:32:13] <ibike365> innociv it's not ideal, but you could check the value at a specified interval?
[13:32:27] <Eviltwin> I think writing all of my code to use .delegate if I might want to clone something is unmaintainable
[13:32:28] <innociv> I don't want to do that. Lol.
[13:32:30] <aaronmcadam> well, it depends
[13:32:31] <Eviltwin> Not to mention slow
[13:32:55] <Eviltwin> It means instead of just getting the events I'm actually interested in
[13:33:01] <Eviltwin> I'm getting *every* event then checking
[13:33:05] <innociv> the keyup event should fire when a child has focus, right?
[13:33:31] <Eviltwin> And it means I need to put identifiers on them that are unique to the desired behavior
[13:33:41] <ibike365> innciv not sure, you'll have to test that
[13:33:44] <dogarrhea2_> oh. event delegation is where you have only 1 event handler and you do if else..
[13:33:57] <aaronmcadam> lol no
[13:34:02] <dogarrhea2_> and the other way is to create a function that handles the event for each and every class of elements that does something different
[13:34:10] <Ogredude> hiya folks
[13:34:21] <aaronmcadam> that's not true, you can make it as contextual as u need
[13:34:55] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: Okay
[13:34:59] <aaronmcadam> i just think that it's easier to look at something with a class of events
[13:35:03] <Eviltwin> I want it to apply to an element that's in a var
[13:35:03] <ibike365> innociv - yeah seems that it does
[13:35:07] <aaronmcadam> rather than ids which are actually the same
[13:35:09] <Eviltwin> And copies I make of it
[13:35:19] <Eviltwin> I don't want to have to do anything else
[13:35:29] <aaronmcadam> if it's the same thing, I'd want it to be a class
[13:35:31] <innociv> Welll
[13:35:37] <aaronmcadam> yes I know what ur sayin Eviltwin
[13:35:42] <innociv> Hard to figure out why this doesn't work and hard to isolate it for a test.
[13:35:52] <ibike365> innociv http://jsfiddle.net/bv74z/1/
[13:36:05] <aaronmcadam> I'm just coming from nearly a year's solid refactoring of shit code
[13:36:17] <Ogredude> I can guarantee I'm not going to be able to make a jsfiddle for this one.  I'm fighting with jQuery in Drupal, and was hoping to get some advice.  Drupal is including jQuery 1.5.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.11 from Google CDN.  The code I'm using is here. https://gist.github.com/1410959  It relies on the quicksand jquery plugin, which is being included and is accessible.  I'm running into an error on line 9 of that gist, browser reports "Uncaught ReferenceE
[13:36:17] <Ogredude> rror: easeInOutQuad is not defined".  I have looked at the jQuery UI that is being included from Google CDN, and the easing functions are quite certainly in there.
[13:36:25] <Ogredude> what should I be looking at next?
[13:36:26] <Eviltwin> I'm coming from years of working primarily in JavaScript
[13:36:29] <aaronmcadam> maybe for this instance I'm overengineering but I just write code in a different way
[13:36:32] <innociv> I have a thousand lines of code here, so it's hard to figure out where the mistake lies ;/
[13:37:03] <Eviltwin> aaronmcadam: What you stated was that .delegate should be used instead of .clone(true)
[13:37:07] <Eviltwin> Without particulars
[13:37:15] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/bv74z/2/ ders yer problem right dur.
[13:37:17] <Eviltwin> I don't think that's a fair thing to say
[13:37:19] <aaronmcadam> I find that stuff bound to ids and then repeated is impossible
[13:37:21] <Ogredude> I have the whole thing working in a plain old HTML file completely outside of Drupal.  Everything's fine there.  Once I put it all into Drupal, apparently the easing functions are getting dropped on the floor
[13:37:21] <innociv> It only works on inputs and such, apparently
[13:37:26] <innociv> Even though the docs say any element
[13:37:29] <Eviltwin> I think there are situations where .delegate would be a better solution
[13:37:34] <aaronmcadam> right
[13:37:43] <Eviltwin> But I would argue there are many if not as many or more cases where it's not the right solution
[13:38:03] <aaronmcadam> I think it's the toss up
[13:38:11] <ibike365> innociv well, you can't really put focus on any element
[13:38:23] <innociv> So how am I supposed to figure out when something is changed in an editablecontent="true"?
[13:38:41] <Eviltwin> innociv: keyup?
[13:38:47] <ibike365> haha
[13:38:59] <ibike365> what kind of element is it?
[13:39:13] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/bv74z/6/
[13:39:18] <innociv> Doesn't work
[13:39:23] <innociv> wait
[13:39:24] <innociv> it does now.
[13:39:24] <innociv> Hm
[13:39:34] <Eviltwin> innociv: Fail
[13:40:13] <ibike365> aight i'm out. laterz
[13:41:28] <dogarrhea2_> o well i don't really care about what the delegation/non-delegation buys me at this point i just want it to work haha
[13:41:31] <dogarrhea2_> i'll worry later if i get millions of users
[13:41:45] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2_: Do you still have an issue?
[13:41:55] <dogarrhea2_> nopes
[13:42:41] <Ogredude> alright
[13:42:54] <johncarlson21> hey guys.. anyone familiar with the jquery ui tabs plugin?
[13:42:54] <Ogredude> now I've ended up with something I can do a jsfiddle on
[13:43:08] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm looking to test run tooltip.  I've included jq1.7 and ui 1.8.16 and the error I'm getting when firing .tooltip() is "this._bind is not a function".  Any ideas?
[13:43:09] <Eviltwin> johncarlson21: Vaguely
[13:43:17] <johncarlson21> wondering why when I set cookie: { expires: 1 } it is pretty sparatic
[13:43:22] <johncarlson21> for instance..
[13:43:34] <Ogredude> managed to duplicate the issue in my standalone html
[13:43:36] <johncarlson21> I load the tabs in with ajax and then initialize it
[13:43:48] <aaronmcadam> MarcGuay: is that coming from jquery.js itself?
[13:43:53] <johncarlson21> if I then refresh the page, and reload the tabs it sometimes works..
[13:44:05] <Eviltwin> Ogredude: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide47
[13:44:17] <MarcGuay> aaronmcadam: Nope, it's tooltip line 43.
[13:44:27] <johncarlson21> if I click another js function to load something else into the page and then load the tabs, it doesn't use the cookie
[13:44:35] <aaronmcadam> what is toolip
[13:44:38] <aaronmcadam> tip*
[13:44:39] <Eviltwin> Err That was for MarcGuay
[13:45:09] <ragas> Ive got a div called PopUp that im loading some content into.  ive got another div called closeIt that i append to PopUp  after its load(). the closeIt div then becomes part of the PopUp div, so that when i close it, and click another popup, the append of CloseIt fails, because the load() content wipes out the div.
[13:45:13] <aaronmcadam> can't see it in the widget list
[13:45:22] <johncarlson21> I'm not destroying the tabs before I load the other content, but I did try that and it didn't make a difference..
[13:45:40] <aaronmcadam> is tooltip official?
[13:45:56] <MarcGuay> Eviltwin: Hi.  I'm not trying to report a bug, I'm trying to get an un-released version of tooltip working.
[13:45:58] <ragas> closeIt no longer exists, so i need to .. ? append a copy of my div?
[13:46:00] <MarcGuay> aaronmcadam: Not released.
[13:46:02] <aaronmcadam> ah
[13:46:11] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle it then?
[13:46:26] <Eviltwin> ragas: How'd you append it in the first place?
[13:46:33] <MarcGuay> Just seeing if I can get it running.  Not sure what combination of versions they've used on the demo page.http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/default.html
[13:46:35] <aaronmcadam> and yeah you're gonna have to step thru the debugger MarcelT3
[13:46:44] <aaronmcadam> MarcGuay*
[13:46:52] <ragas> $('#PopUp').load(url, function() { $(".press_top").prepend($('#closeIt'));  $('#closeIt').show();   });
[13:47:13] <aaronmcadam> ah I think i've seen this actually
[13:47:40] <aaronmcadam> MarcGuay: make a jsfiddle so we can see in what order ur loading them
[13:47:59] <jayblanchard> ragas can you make a jsfiddle so that we can look at it?
[13:48:03] <Eviltwin> ragas: Do .prepend($('#closeIt').clone(true)) instead
[13:48:21] <Eviltwin> Or rework your code to use delegate
[13:48:34] <aaronmcadam> MarcGuay: should be: jq1.7,jq.ui.core, jq.ui.widget, jq.ui.position, jq.ui.toolip
[13:49:02] <MarcGuay> aaronmcadam: Yup.  I'm pulling jq1.7 and the full package from google's CDN.
[13:49:06] <MarcGuay> In that order.
[13:49:08] <MarcGuay> Basically.
[13:49:10] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[13:49:19] <xaristax> Hi everyone correct me if im wrong im a little confuse right now iam trying to create a rain effect with jquery the thing is that i create an object that holds the image for this effect $drop = $("<img src='drop.jpg' ") and im trying to used again in a loop and it dosn't work only if i create it over an over again into the loop is this correct or is a better way... sorry for the english
[13:49:32] <aaronmcadam> very hard to see the problem without ur code MarcGuay
[13:49:33] <MarcGuay> aaronmcadam: Could be some other random conflict, don't sweat it.
[13:49:37] <MarcGuay> Yup.
[13:49:55] <aaronmcadam> sounds almost as if widget isn't working
[13:50:11] <sarspazam> i asked this in #asp.net a minute ago, but can anyone recommend and code snippet software?
[13:50:13] <aaronmcadam> sure it's not pulling of git edge?
[13:50:21] <sarspazam> ideally where i could save the snippets in my dropbox
[13:50:27] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/GNXxQ/1/ Okay here. Got a non-working working example.
[13:50:35] <innociv> You can see my plight :(
[13:50:47] <sarspazam> any*
[13:51:15] <xaristax> anyone??.. that could give me a hand
[13:51:21] <aaronmcadam> sarspazam: tried this? http://delicious.com/redirect?url=http%3A//kodery.com/
[13:51:30] <aaronmcadam> damn thing hha
[13:51:37] <aaronmcadam> I've not started using it yet
[13:51:41] <aaronmcadam> but looks cool
[13:51:46] <aaronmcadam> I was going to write one myself
[13:51:47] <innociv> shouldn't you have /> at the end of that?
[13:52:24] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: yeah innociv is right
[13:52:26] <ragas> that works eviltwin, thanks.
[13:52:49] <xaristax> yes in fact i have it that way only that i dont put it here... you know the hurry :P
[13:53:00] <innociv> Make a jsfiddle.
[13:53:07] <innociv> Then there will be less confusion
[13:53:09] <xaristax> this is how i have it in my code $imagen = $("<img style='position:absolute;' class='rain' src='drop.png' />");
[13:53:10] <Ogredude> hot damn.  Here's a jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/W4jM2/
[13:53:28] <Ogredude> it demonstrates the error.  I think I did the whole (function($) { thing wrong
[13:53:31] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: why don't u create the img outside your each
[13:53:43] <aaronmcadam> and yeah a fiddle would help
[13:54:03] <xaristax> aaronmcadam i doit that way but it only creates one element instead of doing a lot of drops
[13:54:15] <sarspazam> aaronmcadam: no i haven't but that looks cool thanks
[13:54:27] <aaronmcadam> append it in
[13:54:37] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to recreate it
[13:54:39] <sarspazam> jcodecollector is shite on w7 64bit
[13:54:40] <aaronmcadam> just append it
[13:54:48] <Ogredude> oh ffs
[13:54:51] <sarspazam> and there are some other cool ones, but i wanna save the db in my dropbox
[13:54:54] <Ogredude> someone hand me a pair of quotes, please
[13:55:12] * johnjohnson hands Ogredude some "'s
[13:55:12] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: im gonna give a link so you can see my code wait a second :D
[13:55:26] <Ogredude> johnjohnson: thanks.  http://jsfiddle.net/W4jM2/1/
[13:56:40] <aaronmcadam> still acts a bit weird tho
[13:57:05] <aaronmcadam> why do the first 3 keep disappearing
[13:57:25] <aaronmcadam> is it ur css
[13:57:59] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: here is the code running http://200.66.108.210/tiempo/
[13:58:24] <aaronmcadam> ok?
[13:58:53] <xaristax> the only problem is that is to slow and i thing that is because i create the image over and over again into the for loop
[13:58:56] <aaronmcadam> man ur indentation is non existent heh
[13:59:14] <aaronmcadam> yea
[13:59:21] <aaronmcadam> you're recreating the image every time
[13:59:23] <aaronmcadam> why
[13:59:24] <jayblanchard> xaristax it is running really quickly from what I can see
[13:59:25] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/GNXxQ/6/ Um
[13:59:29] <innociv> Why the hell can't I select the iframe?
[13:59:30] <aaronmcadam> why don't u create it once
[13:59:43] <aaronmcadam> and then set the css on it
[13:59:53] <xaristax> because if i create it once it only show one time i dont know why
[14:00:04] <aaronmcadam> doesn't help that ur vars are in spanish haha
[14:00:10] <xaristax> hahahaha damm it how dont i thing in that
[14:00:12] <aaronmcadam> u just append it in
[14:00:33] <aaronmcadam> you're already appending it in
[14:00:42] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: you are complet it right maybe the solucion is in the CSS :d
[14:00:44] <xaristax> :d
[14:00:46] <xaristax> :D
[14:00:55] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[14:01:00] <xaristax> aaronmcadam++
[14:01:10] <aaronmcadam> you could even create your gota array outside
[14:01:11] <xaristax> THANKS MAN YOU SOLVE MY PROBLEM LIKE IN 2 SECONDS
[14:01:15] <aaronmcadam> or maybe not
[14:01:28] <aaronmcadam> basically u gotta do as little as possible inside that for
[14:01:48] <aaronmcadam> especially cuz it's in a setInterval too
[14:01:58] <xaristax> im gonna follow your advice but im pretty sure that is gonna work with css
[14:02:26] <aaronmcadam> the appending to the DOM is still gonna be expensive
[14:02:32] <aaronmcadam> and using the css method too
[14:02:52] <aaronmcadam> unfortunately doesn't look like you can get around that
[14:03:15] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: but dont you thing that if i create the element once i can set the background with css? that would be less expensive dont you thing in resources of the system
[14:03:28] <krogant> hi, i'm trying to slide in a div from the left with the ui slide effect, but i want it to slide further than the default distance - how do i do this?
[14:03:36] <aaronmcadam> unless, as I say, u create a big array of random xPos,widths and alphas before
[14:03:48] <aaronmcadam> and then add them in inside the loop
[14:04:06] <xaristax> i will leave the loop the more clean as possible :D
[14:04:13] <aaronmcadam> xaristax yeah, much better, but still inserting els into the dom is expensive
[14:04:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:04:43] <jayblanchard> ?
[14:04:48] <xaristax> :D thanks again aaronmcadam
[14:04:49] <aaronmcadam> also, define ur vars outside the for loop xaristax
[14:05:00] <aaronmcadam> so say: var xPos = 0; etc
[14:05:12] <aaronmcadam> and then inside ur for, drop the var keyword
[14:05:26] <xaristax> ok like a global variable
[14:05:36] <aaronmcadam> no, not a global
[14:05:38] <aaronmcadam> but scoped
[14:05:39] <aaronmcadam> yes
[14:05:40] <ragas> .prepend($('#closeIt').clone(true));  from here, how would i modify the display attr of the clone only?
[14:05:50] <aaronmcadam> for loops don't scope vars
[14:06:02] <aaronmcadam> so you were recreating that var on each iteration
[14:06:08] <aaronmcadam> not reassigning values to them
[14:06:43] <aaronmcadam> a minor optimisation like that could save u some cycles with this use case
[14:06:56] <xaristax> :D ok i will try and see what happend im sure that is gonna improve the speed
[14:07:04] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: another one, use a while (i--)
[14:07:07] <aaronmcadam> instead of for
[14:07:12] <aaronmcadam> that's faster
[14:07:55] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: var i = arr.length; while (i--) {}
[14:09:02] <xaristax> :D Thanks
[14:09:03] <jayblanchard> krogant can you set up a jsfiddle to show your code?
[14:09:16] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: and another, instead of gota = new Array(),. use gota = []
[14:10:22] <bobdobbs> I'm looking for a list, prefereablly in plain text, of all the jquery methods
[14:10:40] <xaristax> yep i alway use [] but in my frustration i put Array() :P hoping the things work but know i have a much better idea of what to do THANKS TO YOU
[14:11:36] <krogant> why wouldn't this be working? $('#foo').effect('slide', {distance: 300}, 400)
[14:12:06] <jayblanchard> bobdobbs the closest thing that I know to that is http://visualjquery.com/
[14:12:27] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: try this http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/64Jwy/
[14:12:35] <aaronmcadam> just some tidy up xaristax
[14:13:03] <aaronmcadam> sorry one edit
[14:14:40] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam: god damn optional param i forgot about in splice
[14:14:41] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:14:42] <jayblanchard> krogant look at the syntax here http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[14:14:46] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/7kXxX/4/
[14:14:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah I saw Dave_Stein
[14:14:52] <aaronmcadam> bugger eh
[14:14:58] <aaronmcadam> are u gonna use slice instead?
[14:15:11] <Dave_Stein> nah just used splice
[14:15:17] <Dave_Stein> args.length
[14:15:29] <aaronmcadam> cool
[14:15:36] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/64Jwy/
[14:15:49] <Dave_Stein> i have a few more places in my code to fix it now
[14:16:11] <krogant> jayblanchard: thanks, i've had a look at http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Slide and it doesn't really explain the distance very well
[14:16:37] <bobdobbs> jayblanchard: that might help. Thanks
[14:16:54] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: thanks for the code men im gonna copy/paste and study :D
[14:17:02] <aaronmcadam> 1 min one more edit!
[14:17:04] <aaronmcadam> :D
[14:17:12] <xaristax> :D ok
[14:17:41] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/64Jwy/
[14:18:04] <aaronmcadam> ah damn, saw another!
[14:18:31] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: with comments and all the stuff you really rock men
[14:18:32] <xaristax> :D
[14:18:45] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: refresh dude
[14:18:54] <aaronmcadam> that's the last one i can see
[14:19:06] <aaronmcadam> just basically removing as much as u can that doesn't need repeating
[14:19:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[14:19:34] <aaronmcadam> missed of a var name :D
[14:19:48] <aaronmcadam> finally: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/64Jwy/ xaristax :)
[14:20:12] <aaronmcadam> dammit haha another one!! :D
[14:20:48] <xaristax> :D
[14:20:55] <aaronmcadam> got it now i think :)
[14:21:13] <jayblanchard> krogant I usually use animate for things like that
[14:21:16] <xaristax> :D Perfect
[14:22:19] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: sorry dude with all the edits lol
[14:22:36] <aaronmcadam> I've just commented out the 2 lines that setInterval
[14:22:40] <aaronmcadam> cuz it was raping my browser
[14:23:23] <krogant> jayblanchard: could i rotate and slide in with animate?
[14:23:26] <aaronmcadam> so if u refresh that link, xaristax that's the best I can think of
[14:24:13] <jayblanchard> krogant I don't see why not
[14:24:22] <nayena> I got this i have intercepted with a click handler on the submit button, and after i have done some validation, i change the class on the button, change the text and disable it - why does my form stop there and doesnt continue submission?
[14:24:33] <xaristax> aaronmcadam : i think you give all the solution thanks :d
[14:24:37] <xaristax> :D
[14:24:38] <nayena> wait what, something got lost there
[14:24:43] <nayena> i got this form*
[14:24:52] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: you may need to rework it some more
[14:24:52] <Bankzilla> Anyone knowledgeable in the jquery mobile department? the channel seems pretty dead
[14:24:55] <aaronmcadam> but give that a go
[14:25:33] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work lets hang out
[14:25:35] <xaristax> yep but is a big improve to my code im gonna clean it a little bit and work on the updatePhysics function :D
[14:25:47] <krogant> jayblanchard: at the same time? like a ball rolling in?
[14:25:50] <aaronmcadam> cool man
[14:26:13] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: try and think of ways u can store values instead of rechecking the dom, that's the big one
[14:26:18] <jayblanchard> krogant you may have to add in some raphael.js
[14:26:28] <nayena> I have narrowed my error down to that if i put $(this).prop('disabled','disabled'); - my form will not submit. Is it because i use prop?
[14:26:30] <krogant> raphael?
[14:26:58] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: may not be that useful but: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[14:27:14] <jayblanchard> krogant http://raphaeljs.com/
[14:27:20] <aaronmcadam> it's good to know about that stuff, but what we're doing isn't totally jq specific
[14:27:28] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: thanks for the slides :D
[14:27:35] <jayblanchard> nayena please post your code to jsfiddle so that we can have a look.
[14:27:52] <aaronmcadam> no worries
[14:28:46] <aaronmcadam> I've seen another optimisation xaristax
[14:29:03] <_thumper_> Hey, how do I fire javascript on checkbox checked/unchecked?
[14:29:56] <xaristax> ooo :D where?
[14:30:14] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/64Jwy/ in updatePhysics, I've cached the window height
[14:30:30] <aaronmcadam> if u look above the func, there's 2 vars caching height and width
[14:31:00] <aaronmcadam> actually, that could even be a var itself dude
[14:31:08] <jayblanchard> krogant check this out http://code.google.com/p/jquery-rotate/
[14:31:33] <xaristax> ooo yep assign to a variable so i dont need to be asking the dom for the width every time right?
[14:31:56] <aaronmcadam> xaristax: refresh
[14:32:05] <aaronmcadam> exactly xaristax!
[14:32:20] <xaristax> :D
[14:32:26] <aaronmcadam> good man :)
[14:32:35] <aaronmcadam> u seen what i've done there now?
[14:32:44] <aaronmcadam> so the offsetHeight is already calculated
[14:32:46] <jayblanchard> _thumper_ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/715124/how-do-i-make-a-checkbox-fire-a-function
[14:32:48] <aaronmcadam> before that func has to run
[14:33:20] <xaristax> you are a genius men really really thanks
[14:33:33] <aaronmcadam> oh not really, these are just simple optimisations
[14:33:55] <xaristax> :D haha now you make feel bad :P
[14:33:55] <aaronmcadam> it's just a matter of lookin at ur code to see where you can refactor
[14:34:26] <aaronmcadam> u already knew what was wrong xaristax i'm just demonstrating how to improve the code, at least u understand
[14:34:29] <xaristax> yep maybe i need some time to read my code and see how can i improve it
[14:34:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah and it can take time to see where you can improve it too
[14:35:00] <aaronmcadam> sometimes it's not that obvious
[14:35:28] <xaristax> you made pretty obvious :D and clear
[14:35:42] <aaronmcadam> uhoh
[14:35:49] <aaronmcadam> ur site made my tab crash
[14:35:50] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:36:15] <aaronmcadam> you're going to need to use setInterval to give the code a chance to set all the vars
[14:36:55] <xaristax> yep in fact i thing that making drops of water fall all over again its not so good idea :P
[14:37:57] <aaronmcadam> shit man
[14:37:58] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:38:23] <aaronmcadam> can u comment out the setInterval line
[14:38:25] <tidalwav1> For some reason, if I do an element.text("someText") followed by an element.width(), 0 is returned, even though the element is visible. Any ideas why? Is .text() asynchronous?
[14:38:33] <aaronmcadam> and the "}, 10)" line too
[14:38:36] <nisseni> I'm trying to do an onFocus where the value is suppossed to dissapear from the field, it works great with ordinary characters, but when using "Ã¥" I'm not sure how to treat it, I've tried regular Ã¥ and &aring; - but it doesn't do the trick, anyone?
[14:38:49] <aaronmcadam> to see if the function will run at least 5 times
[14:38:53] <xaristax> aaronmcadam: man gotta go enough for today :P REALLY thanks for giving me some of your time :D
[14:39:00] <aaronmcadam> hah alright
[14:39:01] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[14:39:07] <aaronmcadam> hopefully u learned a few things
[14:39:21] <xaristax> a lot of things THANKS :d
[14:39:28] <aaronmcadam> np cool
[14:39:29] <xaristax> :d
[14:40:51] <nisseni> anyone?
[14:41:31] <aaronmcadam> surely the actual character should have nothing to do with it disappearing
[14:41:45] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle is needed here
[14:42:15] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: how are you clearing the field
[14:43:31] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/zlqzoimqxovc0bzl4dmsda - a snippet
[14:44:37] <_thumper_> Can someone tell me what is wrong with this?  $("#chkRememberME").onclick(function () {}) ?
[14:44:52] <_thumper_> Checking the checkbox is not firing it
[14:45:34] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/DYQkG/
[14:45:58] <aaronmcadam> wtf is inputfocus?
[14:46:28] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: a script I downloaded... - but it works perfect on every value but "ByggÃ¥r"
[14:46:39] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with my fiddle
[14:47:24] <aaronmcadam> u can't just set html entities into a form value like that can u
[14:47:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah u can't
[14:48:13] <aaronmcadam> nisseni there's no need for a plugin to do this
[14:48:25] <aaronmcadam> just set placeholders
[14:48:29] <aaronmcadam> like a title attr
[14:48:36] <aaronmcadam> like what I've done except use something else?
[14:49:37] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: I'm not that good with jQuery - hence my trial and error - and the error now is on a word with Ã¥ in it, isn't my method good then?
[14:49:53] <dogarrhea2_> how many developers on jquery ui
[14:49:58] <aaronmcadam> shitloads
[14:50:03] <JohnnyM> http://www.cmclk.com/smash.html <-- can someone tell me why that function isnt working for the input field?
[14:50:09] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: yeah you're method is wrong
[14:50:18] <JohnnyM> id like the function to check if the keyboard was smashed on input
[14:50:19] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: did u look at my example
[14:50:25] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/DYQkG/
[14:51:47] <aaronmcadam> you're not logging anything out it's hard to debug
[14:52:04] <nisseni> true - and as I said, I'm very novice with this
[14:52:26] <aaronmcadam> talking to JohnnyM i was
[14:52:27] <thebignoise> can you get the element that was clicked when an element looses focus
[14:52:54] <aaronmcadam> what?
[14:53:10] <aaronmcadam> catch the next click whenever an element loses focus?
[14:53:34] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: do u understand my jsfiddle?
[14:53:54] <thebignoise> i have a focusout function and it hides an element but i want to have a click function inside the focus out
[14:54:02] <nisseni> I think I do, but I have a hard time putting it in context
[14:54:18] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:54:28] <aaronmcadam> why don't u define the click handler thebignoise
[14:54:30] <thebignoise> http://cl.ly/241H1d3s2E1J081z273E -- thats what i mean. it hides the element before it has time to change the val
[14:54:31] <aaronmcadam> and then trigger it inside
[14:54:39] <aaronmcadam> make a jsfiddle
[14:54:50] <nisseni> because I have no idea on how to do it :)
[14:54:54] <nisseni> that's why
[14:54:59] <thebignoise> ok
[14:55:04] <aaronmcadam> don't assign the handler inside ur focusout
[14:55:09] <aaronmcadam> trigger it instead
[14:55:22] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: I was talking to thebignoise
[14:55:33] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: yeah, saw that now, a bit tired
[14:55:38] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[14:55:53] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: what is the problem you're actually trying to solve with that code
[14:56:12] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: I presumed you were trying to set the text of the input based on focusing the element
[14:56:33] <thebignoise> its kinda hard to make jsfiddle it uses a database
[14:56:37] <thebignoise> with ajax requests
[14:56:40] <aaronmcadam> just stub it
[14:56:45] <aaronmcadam> simplify it
[14:56:49] <nisseni> exactly what your code does, but in another way I guess, the value goes away when focusing the element
[14:56:50] <aaronmcadam> doesn't have to actually work
[14:57:03] <aaronmcadam> yes nisseni that's how it's meant to work
[14:57:15] <nisseni> and it works fine with all the other values except for the one with a different character
[14:57:26] <aaronmcadam> sounds strange
[14:58:00] <thebignoise> http://jsfiddle.net/sbSEL/
[14:58:03] <thebignoise> well thats the code
[14:58:16] <aaronmcadam> thebignoise: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/q8Qdb/
[14:58:16] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/mmo/a.php why isn't the a turning into a q?
[14:58:19] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: also, the values in the fields array is for checking if it's the same value when validating wether it's filled or not
[14:58:49] <thebignoise> not really sure how to simplify it
[14:59:02] <_thumper_> Is there a link that reflects the latest full JQuery that i can add in <head>?
[14:59:05] <aaronmcadam> thebignoise: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/sbSEL/1/

[15:01:00] <aaronmcadam> ah
[15:01:05] <aaronmcadam> u can use the google api for that
[15:01:30] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: thats seems to work except it return the last element in the list
[15:02:00] <aaronmcadam> what list?
[15:02:09] <aaronmcadam> u've not explained what ur even doing
[15:02:29] <_thumper_> coldhead: Excuse me for not writing 100% correct grammer and spelling :)
[15:02:38] <catcher> grammar*
[15:02:45] <catcher> ;)

[15:03:06] <workmad3> _thumper_: 'Please excuse me for not being completely accurate with my grammar and spelling' :P
[15:03:07] <_thumper_> not
[15:03:20] <_thumper_> hehe
[15:04:07] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: sorry. i have search box and after each keyup it sends out an ajax requests and gets a 'list' of possible matches and creates a drop down box for probable searches
[15:04:27] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: any idea on my issue? :)
[15:04:40] <_thumper_> Yeah my OCD usually kicks in and makes me fix my grammar.
[15:05:53] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:05:58] <aaronmcadam> u need to use delegation then
[15:06:01] <aaronmcadam> instead of click
[15:06:09] <aaronmcadam> use the $.on api

[15:07:43] <JohnnyM> http://www.cmclk.com/smash.html <-- can someone tell me why that function isnt working for the input field?
[15:07:45] <JohnnyM> id like the function to check if the keyboard was smashed on input
[15:07:54] <JohnnyM> can anyone give me some feedback on that?

[15:10:53] <thebignoise> newest one i think
[15:10:56] <thebignoise> one sec
[15:10:56] <aaronmcadam> think?
[15:10:58] <aaronmcadam> good man
[15:11:22] <thebignoise> nope sorry 1.6.4 i need 1.7 eh?
[15:11:32] <aaronmcadam> nope if u don't wanna upgrade
[15:11:41] <aaronmcadam> do u not wanna upgrade?
[15:11:52] <aaronmcadam> u don't *have* to for this to work
[15:11:59] <aaronmcadam> just need to use a different method
[15:12:08] <aaronmcadam> yay/nay
[15:12:17] <aaronmcadam> ?
[15:12:57] <thebignoise> 1.7 is fine
[15:13:01] <thebignoise> doesnt really matter eh?
[15:13:05] <aaronmcadam> 1.7.1
[15:13:09] <thebignoise> right
[15:13:26] <aaronmcadam> if u don't wanna uplift ur app
[15:13:26] <thebignoise> well that scripts is setting the val
[15:13:31] <aaronmcadam> u can just use delegate
[15:13:47] <aaronmcadam> and swap around the el and event type params
[15:13:54] <thebignoise> .on is fine
[15:14:02] <aaronmcadam> kk
[15:14:13] <thebignoise> although its only setting the value
[15:14:19] <thebignoise> doesnt seem like the focus out is being called
[15:14:20] <aaronmcadam> um
[15:14:30] <aaronmcadam> that's cuz that's what ur func is doing?
[15:14:41] <aaronmcadam> are suggestions hiding?

[15:15:56] <aaronmcadam> k
[15:16:02] <thebignoise> okay they are now
[15:16:04] <aaronmcadam> ha
[15:16:07] <aaronmcadam> what was it
[15:16:09] <thebignoise> lol
[15:16:13] <thebignoise> the element name was wrong
[15:16:18] <thebignoise> but it still giving me the last value
[15:16:18] <aaronmcadam> cool
[15:16:21] <thebignoise> not the one i clicked
[15:16:35] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:16:41] <aaronmcadam> ah of course
[15:16:47] <aaronmcadam> you're not telling it a specific one to click
[15:17:02] <aaronmcadam> $('.sug_res').click();
[15:17:08] <aaronmcadam> that's not specific enough
[15:17:14] <aaronmcadam> u need closest
[15:17:19] <aaronmcadam> or set a class
[15:17:25] <thebignoise> $('.sug_res').click($(this)) ?
[15:17:36] <aaronmcadam> or use eq to check the index
[15:17:44] <aaronmcadam> that won't work
[15:17:49] <thebignoise> lol figured not
[15:18:17] <aaronmcadam> hang on
[15:18:48] <aaronmcadam> u need a refence to the suggestion right?
[15:18:54] <aaronmcadam> reference*
[15:19:17] <thebignoise> noo...?
[15:19:31] <thebignoise> well yes i think so i understand what your asking
[15:19:37] <aaronmcadam> well then how are u going to click the right one
[15:20:12] <aaronmcadam> right, does ur search_method contain the the text u want to pass to the keyword_search
[15:20:46] <aaronmcadam> it's quite difficult to guess what you're doing without some html at least
[15:20:53] <thebignoise> yes. 'search_methods' contains 'suggestions' and 'suggestions' contains the actual suggestiosn
[15:21:11] <thebignoise> its cakephp so shit is all over the place
[15:21:17] <thebignoise> its hard to show you a snippet that will help
[15:21:22] <aaronmcadam> ok
[15:22:04] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[15:22:37] <aaronmcadam> so the text entered into search_method matches suggestions
[15:22:53] <aaronmcadam> and then you want to trigger a click on the matching suggestion
[15:22:59] <aaronmcadam> but what if there's more than 1?
[15:23:10] <aaronmcadam> how can u tell which one to click on?
[15:23:14] <aaronmcadam> the closest one?
[15:23:17] <ColKurtz> Could anybody help point me in a direction for a better way to organize these different animations? http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html code at http://pastie.org/2946852
[15:23:21] <thebignoise> its just an autocomplete function
[15:23:23] <aaronmcadam> the first in the list thebignoise
[15:23:26] <aaronmcadam> ?
[15:23:31] <ColKurtz> There's a 'booklet' with 3 pages or panes
[15:23:39] <thebignoise> the user is going to click it
[15:23:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah thebignoise i know what ur trying to do
[15:23:44] <thebignoise> im not going to know whats clicked
[15:23:54] <ColKurtz> and each pane has 3 buttons, each of which is supposed to spawn a different 'scene'
[15:23:55] <aaronmcadam> right so why trigger it then?
[15:24:08] <aaronmcadam> there's no need to trigger :)
[15:24:21] <aaronmcadam> remove the line from focusout that triggers the click then
[15:24:38] <ColKurtz> So far I've got the first pane mostly set up, but it's being pretty buggy with destroying the current scene and adding the new scene
[15:25:24] <aaronmcadam> sorry thebignoise I didn't fully think about what u were trying to do in the first place
[15:25:37] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: well i didnt help that i can't epxlain shit
[15:25:38] <thebignoise> lol
[15:25:50] <aaronmcadam> haha no worries, if u remove the trigger, does it work?
[15:25:57] <ColKurtz> damn boss wants to see this whole thing done by end of day D:
[15:26:03] <aaronmcadam> fuck ur boss :P hehe
[15:26:12] <aaronmcadam> sounds pretty straight forward
[15:26:20] <ColKurtz> did you check it out?
[15:26:27] <aaronmcadam> why don't you replace the content instead of recreating
[15:26:30] <ColKurtz> it's a little quiz with 9 questions on 3 pages
[15:26:49] <aaronmcadam> looking at it now, it's loading, deep breath
[15:27:05] <ColKurtz> because each 'scene' has a different number of elements and whatnot
[15:27:08] <aaronmcadam> yeah... 193 lines is fun
[15:27:36] <aaronmcadam> christ
[15:27:45] <aaronmcadam> can u point me to where the problem is?
[15:27:49] <ColKurtz> i've never done anything this complicated and so i'm sure it's pretty apparent that my organization for such a thing is messy
[15:28:04] <ColKurtz> Click the beach button
[15:28:09] <aaronmcadam> what?
[15:28:12] <aaronmcadam> it's a pastie
[15:28:13] <ColKurtz> and then click the recreational activities button
[15:28:16] <aaronmcadam> make it a jsfiddle
[15:28:20] <ColKurtz> http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html
[15:28:37] <ColKurtz> it's kind of complicated for jsfiddle
[15:28:45] <ColKurtz> you'll see
[15:28:45] <ColKurtz> lol
[15:28:46] <aaronmcadam> u can always abstract
[15:28:56] <aaronmcadam> which is what ur meant to do for jsfiddles
[15:29:03] <aaronmcadam> I don't need all ur app specific stuff
[15:29:34] <ColKurtz> did you take a look at it?
[15:29:35] <aaronmcadam> what's the issue?
[15:29:38] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:29:49] <ColKurtz> there's lots of animations and shit going on
[15:30:04] <ColKurtz> Click 1 button, and then click another button
[15:30:09] <ColKurtz> in the first pane
[15:30:27] <ColKurtz> just click around with the buttons
[15:30:30] <aaronmcadam> that sea is mighty rough lookin no surfin today that shit's mad lol
[15:30:41] <ColKurtz> lol
[15:30:42] <sirtophat> seems I can't use .position() to actually change the element's position, only retrieve it?
[15:31:05] <aaronmcadam> yep
[15:31:16] <aaronmcadam> just set top and left from it
[15:31:35] <sirtophat> I'm doing that but it doesn't seem to do anything
[15:31:46] <aaronmcadam> have u set a positioning context on it?
[15:31:53] <aaronmcadam> as in abs/relative, etc
[15:32:20] <sirtophat> position:absolute;
[15:32:25] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/mmo/
[15:33:08] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/GNXxQ/6/ Why can't I select the iframe in this?
[15:33:09] <sirtophat> fixed it
[15:33:12] <aaronmcadam> ColKurtz: dude i dunno what to say to u, what's the problem?
[15:33:21] <ColKurtz> it's just buggy
[15:33:26] <ColKurtz> the way the animations are queued up
[15:33:31] <crazee> Basic selector question. How do I search by the text contents of an element?
[15:33:32] <aaronmcadam> ColKurtz: some of the scenes aren't removed properly it seems
[15:33:41] <ColKurtz> and i'm pretty sure it could be cleaned up to work much better
[15:33:41] <crazee> Contains works, but also gets all parent nodes
[15:33:43] <aaronmcadam> are you using the actual queue api?
[15:33:55] <ColKurtz> i'm just starting to get drained
[15:34:04] <aaronmcadam> crazee: use filter() too
[15:34:08] <ColKurtz> i think the queue api is used implicitly no?
[15:34:08] <aaronmcadam> ?filter @ crazee
[15:34:09] <bot-t> crazee, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:34:19] <aaronmcadam> I'm not so sure
[15:34:29] <crazee> filter...ok thanks aaronmcadam
[15:35:04] <aaronmcadam> ColKurtz: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/api-queue-dequeue/
[15:35:27] <aaronmcadam> ColKurtz: you could also look at using deferreds within animations too
[15:35:33] <gdoteof> i am using some jquery draggable module for drupal and it is not dragging to certain places on the screen
[15:35:52] <gdoteof> i am wondering what to look for to see why i might not be able to move something to a certain part of the screen
[15:37:52] <aaronmcadam> gdoteof: are u using drupal 6?
[15:40:58] <bobdobbs> how do I get the parent of 'this' ?
[15:42:20] <aaronmcadam> hm?
[15:42:23] <Zzaichik> $(this).parent() doesn't work huh
[15:42:50] <aaronmcadam> kind of ironic that u asked that question with no context
[15:43:08] <Zzaichik> :/
[15:43:40] <sirtophat> $("#element").css("top") is returning NULL
[15:43:42] <bobdobbs> Zzaichik: in my case, $(this).parent().addClass() returns an error. I'll paste my code...
[15:44:07] <sirtophat> actually it's returning [object DOMwindow]
[15:44:26] <aaronmcadam> is top set?
[15:44:39] <aaronmcadam> you need position, see ? position
[15:44:39] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[15:44:47] <bobdobbs> http://jsfiddle.net/nwLFF/
[15:44:50] <Zzaichik> ^
[15:44:51] <sirtophat> it is, but why would it have to be "set"? it's an inherent thing isn't it as along as it's on the page
[15:45:01] <aaronmcadam> not always
[15:45:19] <aaronmcadam> bobdobbs: http://jsfiddle.net/nwLFF/1/

[15:45:51] * bobdobbs facepalms
[15:45:58] <bobdobbs> thanks
[15:46:11] <aaronmcadam> prevent the default too
[15:46:44] <bobdobbs> Ah yes.
[15:46:52] <aaronmcadam> u forgot the dot
[15:46:54] <_thumper_> How do I fire an event each time a textbox is modified?
[15:46:56] <aaronmcadam> was that it?
[15:47:06] <aaronmcadam> _thumper_: try the change method
[15:47:12] <aaronmcadam> s/method/event
[15:47:18] <sirtophat> $("#element").position.left is just [object DOMWindow]
[15:47:19] <_thumper_> something like $("#textbox1").Change?
[15:47:22] <aaronmcadam> aye
[15:47:33] <_thumper_> thanks :)
[15:47:50] <aaronmcadam> lowercase
[15:48:40] <sirtophat> $("#element").position().left is NULL
[15:48:50] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle plz
[15:50:01] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/mmo/
[15:50:26] <aaronmcadam> what's nope
[15:50:51] <sirtophat> the text in the div called main
[15:50:58] <sirtophat> which will be images
[15:51:02] <sirtophat> later on
[15:51:11] <aaronmcadam> uh
[15:51:18] <sirtophat> the farthest background
[15:51:23] <aaronmcadam> can't u make this a simple fiddle that only shows the problem
[15:51:38] <aaronmcadam> i really don't wanna have to understand what ur app is doing
[15:52:05] <Zzaichik> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[15:52:14] <Zzaichik> I don't think you're using that properly
[15:52:29] <_thumper_> ok change() event is triggered only when the textbox looses focus
[15:52:37] <_thumper_> Can i fire it every time I input text?
[15:52:57] <aaronmcadam> keyup within it
[15:53:07] <aaronmcadam> keyup|keydown
[15:53:13] <aaronmcadam> bind to both if u want
[15:53:57] <sirtophat> somehow it works when I make a small example
[15:54:04] <aaronmcadam> well then there u are
[15:54:12] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle is great for sanity checking
[15:54:18] <yelvert> anyone know why jqueryui autocomplete on a textarea would put the list menu INSIDE the textarea rather than after/outside it?
[15:55:07] <_thumper_> thanks aaron
[15:55:22] <aaronmcadam> np
[15:55:41] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[15:56:02] <coldhead> yelvert: css?
[15:56:09] <coldhead> you should be able to inspect it and rectify it
[15:56:21] <coldhead> a container probably needs position:relative
[15:56:28] <coldhead> or somie
[15:56:52] <aaronmcadam> you can't do css with js coldhead, remember :)
[15:57:11] <aaronmcadam> and you can't write js in jQuery, it's so annoying :(
[15:57:27] <yelvert> this is the markup that it is generating https://gist.github.com/1412047
[15:57:36] <diverdud`> How do i set the text of the first option in a select box?
[15:58:16] <aaronmcadam> $('option').first().text('like this')
[15:58:20] <aaronmcadam> or another attr
[15:58:26] <yelvert> coldhead: its not css thats doing it, its the actual generated markup
[15:58:31] <aaronmcadam> value too you'll need diverdud`
[15:59:39] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: but i tried this: $("#ProfilesBirthDtDay option:first").val("tst val"); and it did not work
[15:59:50] <nisseni> I have created a var fields = new Array( content here ) - now I want to use it in $.post( 'url', { fields : fields } ... how ?
[15:59:55] <aaronmcadam> don't use pseudo selectors if u can
[16:00:18] <aaronmcadam> don't use new Array nisseni
[16:00:22] <aaronmcadam> use literals dude
[16:00:39] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: me?
[16:00:49] <sirtophat> why's $("#clickgrabber").position.top undefined? http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/mmo/
[16:00:49] <aaronmcadam> why don't u just set it as an object nisseni
[16:00:54] <nisseni> it's 1 am in the night, I'm not able to learn new stuff now...
[16:00:59] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[16:01:02] <aaronmcadam> oook
[16:01:02] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: I don't know, that's why I'm asking
[16:01:10] <aaronmcadam> I'm suggesting
[16:01:17] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: what am i doing wrong?
[16:01:20] <aaronmcadam> lost in translation :)
[16:01:27] <aaronmcadam> diverdud`: jsfiddle
[16:01:32] <kanzie> can someone help me think straight, Im trying to parse a xml that is pretty straight forward, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to break it up into proper objects. I have a start here: http://jsfiddle.net/jqp2x/
[16:01:37] <nisseni> haven't solved the other first issue yet, but I'm always there with the whole shadaddle
[16:01:55] <aaronmcadam> ?parseXML @ kanzie
[16:01:55] <bot-t> kanzie, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[16:02:22] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: thanksâ€¦you might want to look at the fiddle first though
[16:02:27] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: the page is to big for jsfiddle
[16:02:35] <aaronmcadam> abstract your problem
[16:02:37] <kanzie> understanding the problem is one step to a solution
[16:02:40] <aaronmcadam> I don't wanna see ur whole app
[16:03:07] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: but regardless of all the "why don't you" - how do I put an array in $.post ?
[16:03:20] <aaronmcadam> I was telling u what to do nisseni
[16:03:24] <aaronmcadam> u misunderstand
[16:03:35] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: if the 5 lines of code is a whole app. I have extracted the relevant snippet. But don't bother man, Im sure there is someone that can help me other than you
[16:03:38] <aaronmcadam> kanzie, use parseXML would u
[16:03:47] <aaronmcadam> huh
[16:04:07] <aaronmcadam> ?eval String.trimString
[16:04:11] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: undefined
[16:04:16] <aaronmcadam> what's that
[16:04:33] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: you can't do that
[16:04:36] <aaronmcadam> read the docs
[16:04:39] <kanzie> sorry, ill take it out, its a function defined outside of the snippet.
[16:04:44] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/GNXxQ/6/ Why can't I select the iframe in this?
[16:05:01] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[16:05:05] <yelvert> https://gist.github.com/1412047 why is jqueryui autocomplete generating markup like this?
[16:05:26] <aaronmcadam> it's exactly what ur looking for
[16:05:30] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: reading up now
[16:06:06] <nisseni> ok, aaronmcadam my answer would be, because I don't know how to...
[16:06:17] <nisseni> on the q "why don't you set it as an object"
[16:06:17] <aaronmcadam> man
[16:06:20] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:06:22] <aaronmcadam> meaning
[16:06:25] <aaronmcadam> set it as an object
[16:06:26] <aaronmcadam> literal
[16:06:31] <aaronmcadam> instead of array
[16:06:34] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: I don't see how I could use it really, but you might be right. It might be what I want. I need temp to look like thisâ€¦ (Ill update the fiddle)
[16:06:38] <aaronmcadam> use { bla : bla, bla : bla }
[16:07:11] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: but the array is created by the contact form, so it's already there
[16:07:23] <aaronmcadam> you can use mapo
[16:07:24] <aaronmcadam> you can use map
[16:07:31] <aaronmcadam> to transform it maybe
[16:07:38] <aaronmcadam> or just use serialize
[16:07:47] <aaronmcadam> ?serialize @ nisseni
[16:07:48] <bot-t> nisseni, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/

[16:09:29] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: here is my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FrAdD/
[16:09:36] <aaronmcadam> uh
[16:09:38] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: as you see the value is not changed
[16:09:58] <aaronmcadam> kanzie: you're not using parseXML there
[16:10:32] <kanzie> aaronmcadam:  no Im not, as I was saying I don't really see how to go about it. The docs don't give much examples. But Ill give it a shot
[16:10:38] <aaronmcadam> uh
[16:10:43] <aaronmcadam> just call it on the string it's not hard
[16:10:56] <aaronmcadam> $.parseXML( xml )
[16:11:21] <kanzie> no, its building the object that is tricky
[16:11:42] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: can you see what im doing wrong?
[16:12:13] <aaronmcadam> had to fix ur fiddle
[16:12:37] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: what was wrong with it
[16:12:41] <aaronmcadam> it is right
[16:12:47] <aaronmcadam> you're only setting value tho
[16:12:49] <aaronmcadam> one min
[16:12:57] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: yeah i need to set the text
[16:14:16] <aaronmcadam> diverdud`: http://jsfiddle.net/FrAdD/3/
[16:14:17] <diverdud`> text()
[16:14:21] <diverdud`> i got it
[16:14:40] <aaronmcadam> use mine, it's faster
[16:15:39] <diverdud`> why is it faster?
[16:15:55] <aaronmcadam> diverdud`: http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/
[16:16:01] <aaronmcadam> if u wanna know

[16:16:43] <diverdud`> aaronmcadam: thx
[16:16:44] <aaronmcadam> u asked lol :)
[16:17:05] <nisseni> aaronmcadam: http://pastie.org/private/rgbhh4rapeva45wgoqndkw - there you have step 3 and 4 from the form... now I need the fields array in the fourth step...
[16:17:41] <aaronmcadam> nisseni: i told u 10 mins ago to try serialize()
[16:18:04] <aaronmcadam> you're not even mapping anything there
[16:18:15] <aaronmcadam> you're mapping it onto istelf?
[16:18:19] <aaronmcadam> makes no sense
[16:18:39] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle
[16:18:42] <aaronmcadam> i can't edi thtat

[16:19:24] <someprimetime> is it possible to say click a link and have it trigger a click on a Browse.. file upload button?
[16:19:36] <aaronmcadam> christ
[16:19:38] <aaronmcadam> don't think so
[16:19:48] <someprimetime> i'm someprimetime, but ok thanks
[16:19:49] <aaronmcadam> not sure cross browser events exist for that
[16:19:53] <aaronmcadam> lol
[16:20:06] <aaronmcadam> sorry I didn;t mean u were a fictional character, sorry
[16:20:15] <someprimetime> haha i know i'm just kidding
[16:20:18] <aaronmcadam> :D
[16:20:19] <someprimetime> but really? nothing?
[16:20:22] <someprimetime> man.
[16:20:23] <Raynos> Does anyone here know of a small dom events library thats not baked into a monolithic framework?
[16:20:28] <aaronmcadam> it's not gonna be easy
[16:20:37] <ajpiano> it's not possible
[16:20:40] <aaronmcadam> think about it, it's a browser, OS-specific widget
[16:20:45] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: yeah I don't see how this will help me. The problem is not so much to parse the XML, as how I can structure the resulting object seeings as I get several elements all named "String" and they have a comma-separated list of the values.
[16:20:48] <ajpiano> nor is it possible to programatically set the value of a file input
[16:20:56] <aaronmcadam> nice
[16:20:57] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: it's not even so much that, but that doing so would be a security violation
[16:21:01] <aaronmcadam> thanks for weighing in
[16:21:03] <aaronmcadam> true
[16:21:37] <aaronmcadam> kanzie u can use the traversal methods, etc etc on the parsed xml
[16:21:49] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: hmmâ€¦ ok
[16:22:04] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: but even if the security issues could be sorted, you'd still have OS specific stuff
[16:22:22] <kanzie> but then Im kind of where I startedâ€¦ if I do a .each('name').function() { bla bla
[16:22:24] <aaronmcadam> some sort of sandboxing or something, it'd be a nightmare
[16:22:42] <kanzie> this xml is a nightmare
[16:22:59] <aaronmcadam> depends
[16:23:18] <aaronmcadam> u want to loop over the xml and do what exactly?
[16:23:39] <kanzie> I want to create an object sort of what I have in the comment of
[16:23:40] <kanzie> http://jsfiddle.net/jqp2x/2/
[16:23:47] <kanzie> where the number is the id
[16:24:23] <aaronmcadam> you're trying to create json from xml basically
[16:24:42] <aaronmcadam> any reason why u can't push json over in the first place?
[16:24:49] <aaronmcadam> or do u not have control over the full stack/
[16:25:34] <aaronmcadam> mixing csvs within xml is just retarded too
[16:25:54] <aaronmcadam> who wrote that xml?
[16:26:01] <aaronmcadam> take em out and shoot em now
[16:26:31] <aaronmcadam> every element is generic, how does that make sense
[16:26:38] <testcase> Hello, I am experiancing a really weird probablem with jquerys $.each() helper in Firefox (specifically , 8). The problem is it appears to be looping twice in concession, tracing the output of the call shows the index being 0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3 etc. I put the function I am calling up at pastebin.com/p5U0NX7F
[16:27:27] <aaronmcadam> testcase why are u setting ajaxSettings.traditional?
[16:27:56] <testcase> because I am communicating with a .NET MVC3 application and its needed to bind terms, that however, is not the problem I can assure you. The response comes back
[16:28:09] <testcase> here is the console output I get
[16:28:09] <testcase> process search called search.js (line 92) has results, coming in search.js (line 101) search/result/new called fromprocess_search 0 map.js (line 395) TRUE lat/lng:43.692295/-116.491577 map.js (line 73) ACCESS lat/lng:436922950/-1164915770 map.js (line 76) search/result/new called fromprocess_search 0 map.js (line 395) TRUE lat/lng:43.692295/-116.491577 map.js (line 73) ACCESS lat/lng:436922950/-1164915770 map.js (line 76) search/res
[16:28:18] <testcase> oh crap, meant to plop the pastebin link
[16:28:21] <aaronmcadam> bloody hell man
[16:28:25] <aaronmcadam> heh
[16:28:35] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: the xml is stupid and I have wanted to take them ou to shoot them many o times
[16:28:49] <aaronmcadam> seriously that's not even xml
[16:28:53] <kanzie> One of the reasons is that they "don't believe JSON is a reliable format for the future". Don't get me started
[16:29:06] <testcase> http://pastebin.com/V74thpwy
[16:29:10] <aaronmcadam> it's just some dude writing two custom tags and making it represent anything
[16:29:25] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: yepâ€¦ well its actually a vardump from within Labview
[16:29:26] <aaronmcadam> if they don't believe that, then at least they should learn xml ffs
[16:29:31] <botfather> whut not json not reliable ?
[16:29:48] <botfather> i am banking my future on it ;]
[16:29:52] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:29:53] <kanzie> botfather: they are just scared of everything new and they are not well versed with web
[16:30:01] <botfather> ok pfew ;]
[16:30:06] <aaronmcadam> i'd be quitting soon
[16:30:24] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: so Im stuck with these xml-thingies until next fall when I get to take over the web service and I will rewrite this part to send json
[16:30:25] <testcase> the problem im experiancing leads to dupliate map icons (only on firefox, the rest of the browsers work fine). I traced it all the way into jquery's $each all, and I can see its getting responses for them twice. I know the functions not getting called twice since it only outputs the "process search" once.
[16:30:28] <botfather> clue is one of the most desired skillz around ;]
[16:30:31] <kanzie> this is stuuuupid
[16:30:54] <aaronmcadam> it is stupid
[16:30:57] <aaronmcadam> what you're trying to do
[16:30:58] <testcase> JSON is VERY reliable and used heavily nowadays. Its a much easier to parse communication method.
[16:31:05] <aaronmcadam> what you should do kanzie
[16:31:14] <aaronmcadam> is use XSLT to translate it into something usable
[16:31:20] <aaronmcadam> into proper XML so u can loop over it
[16:31:22] <botfather> i use json to write to file, datastore on GAE and send is over the wire in xmpp
[16:31:24] <testcase> especiall when our building cross-domain services
[16:31:31] <testcase> *when you are building
[16:31:32] <aaronmcadam> ie. make times a time tag, etc etc
[16:31:36] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: listen, this is corporate politics and I just want to get my piece of software done. Then address this for realz further down the line
[16:31:47] <aaronmcadam> I'm telling u what to do
[16:31:54] <aaronmcadam> use XSLT to translate it into actual xml
[16:32:01] <aaronmcadam> it won't be too hard
[16:32:11] <aaronmcadam> next thing ur gonna say is u dunno xslt
[16:32:12] <aaronmcadam> heh
[16:32:17] <botfather> lol
[16:32:26] <testcase> unless you have an expressive need for schema validation (and I highly doubt you really do) then XML is pointless.
[16:32:33] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: Dude, last time I worked with xslt was 2000 when this was actually relevant technologies
[16:32:36] <testcase> its quite easy to translate json into whatever you want.
[16:32:40] <aaronmcadam> u can split the Val tags into multiples based on commas
[16:32:51] <testcase> and you can pass it across same origin policies using jsonp
[16:32:59] <rue> JSON is great and everything, provided you can actually use it.
[16:32:59] <aaronmcadam> xml is still relevant man
[16:33:08] <rue> When you can't, it's kinda useless :)
[16:33:10] <aaronmcadam> not everything can be encoded as json
[16:33:18] <testcase> check out mlspage.com, I power that entire thing with json
[16:33:20] <wathek> Hi everybody
[16:33:34] <aaronmcadam> BACS stuff for example
[16:33:54] <aaronmcadam> to say xml isn't relevant is wrong
[16:33:58] <testcase> anyways, can anyone take a small look at that code and see if there is something im missing? this firefox bug is driving me insane
[16:33:58] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: it isâ€¦ but that's beside the point. I don't feel like start to add xslt to shape my xml is the right way forward. Surely I would be able to parse this into a json-object
[16:34:02] <aaronmcadam> just json suits public apis
[16:34:06] <wathek> how can I avoid things like this : Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion' ? is it possible to check if an object got that method ?
[16:34:13] <z0ned> i'm trying to make this dropdown menu for my navigation bar, and it all works great, but there's a tiny bug (only seems to happen in firefox actually) that i can't seem to fix. http://jsfiddle.net/3CpEJ/2/ if you start above one of the dropdown menus (gl system 10 or gl system 12), quickly move your mouse down and over it, then stop on one of its dropdown list elements, you'll see it get stuck in this slide up/slide down loop
[16:34:13] <z0ned> .
[16:34:18] <aaronmcadam> but you're ending up with horrible code to do it
[16:34:31] <testcase> athek, your disguising another problem. but yes. check if the property is undefined
[16:34:34] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: adding xslt is overkill
[16:34:40] <aaronmcadam> ok
[16:34:52] <testcase> if($(selector).accordion != undefined)
[16:34:52] <aaronmcadam> xslt would split up ur csvs in your tags easier
[16:34:58] <aaronmcadam> but nvm
[16:35:06] <testcase> actually $.accordion != undefined would also work
[16:35:16] <testcase> since im presuming your using jqueryui or something for the accordion
[16:35:25] <testcase> but most everything can be feature tested in that manner.
[16:35:32] <ajpiano> no it can't
[16:35:38] <testcase> yes it can.
[16:36:03] <ajpiano> jquery ui accordion does not put a $.accordion
[16:36:11] <testcase> oh
[16:36:16] <ajpiano> you could check $.fn.accordion or $.ui.accordion
[16:36:19] <testcase> I thought you were talking about testing against any feature
[16:36:32] <ajpiano> oh
[16:36:56] <dogarrhea2> ???? there are only 6 active developers for jquery ui??
[16:37:15] <dogarrhea2> no wonder there are 3 year old unresolved tickets
[16:37:21] <testcase> so ... erm.. anyone having problems with $.each() on firefox 8?
[16:37:25] <ajpiano> but the point is... if you're trying to use accordion and the function isn't defined, what you don't want is a test for whether it's defined
[16:37:41] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: why does this surprise you 6
[16:37:43] <testcase> well no, you probably just want to include the file
[16:37:47] <testcase> he asked if you can test for it
[16:37:49] <ajpiano> 6 is more than we've had in a long time :)
[16:37:49] <testcase> and you can
[16:37:51] <dogarrhea2> i would think this is too little
[16:37:56] <dogarrhea2> and the sign of a dying project
[16:38:07] <dogarrhea2> i'm guessing some of them aren't even full time
[16:38:16] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: when did it have more than that, that it would be "dying"
[16:38:18] <testcase> grrr... you don't need 8 people to maintain a project like that.
[16:38:32] <ajpiano> great
[16:39:00] <testcase> jquery ui is not dead. its just accomplished most of its goals.
[16:39:13] <dogarrhea2> it just seems a little small.. from my estimation experience for the amount of work that needs to be done
[16:39:17] <dogarrhea2> it's not really robust/stable yet
[16:39:29] <testcase> we use it in production at citibank
[16:39:39] <testcase> its stable, we have only had to make minor modifications.
[16:39:55] <ajpiano> it's very stable
[16:39:58] <testcase> and most of those were speed increases for things like dialogs that used slow selectors
[16:40:11] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: it's hard to find people who can volunteer long periods of time to write high quality ui widgets for open source
[16:40:12] <dogarrhea2> i keep finding bugs :(
[16:40:17] <Eviltwin> Pfft
[16:40:21] <z0ned> anyone want to fix my dropdown? :( http://jsfiddle.net/3CpEJ/2/
[16:40:21] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: we're aware that interactions are very buggy
[16:40:25] <ajpiano> in extreme cases
[16:40:39] <ajpiano> testcase: are you sure your issue isn't more of a firefox bug than a jquery one?
[16:40:42] <Eviltwin> z0ned: Not particlarly
[16:40:51] <testcase> ajpiano, thats what I am trying to figure out
[16:40:59] <z0ned> Eviltwin, even if i ask really nicely :D
[16:41:05] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: "But jQuery promises everything will work exactly right in every browser no matter what I do"
[16:41:06] <ajpiano> does the issue happen in webkit?
[16:41:29] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: that's my favourite story of all time
[16:41:35] <wathek> testcase, thank you
[16:41:47] <testcase> ajpiano: oddly enough, it did for a while (safari), not in chrome, then disappeared in safari. but it was a different bug for that one i think.
[16:41:58] <dogarrhea2> i would expect panels to not display exotic behavior when i contrl mousewheel... or draggable to function correclty
[16:42:11] <dogarrhea2> but whatever. it's not jquery ui that's broken it's me right?
[16:42:22] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: huh?
[16:42:28] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/lzqwtmim59fbvg4qcbxg - I want the content from #result in the post-file, I'm doing something wrong, but what?
[16:42:33] <ajpiano> like i said, we're aware that the mouse interactions have some fundamental flaws
[16:42:43] <ajpiano> that we're looking to refactor
[16:43:05] <Eviltwin> nisseni: What?
[16:43:28] <JohnnyM> http://www.cmclk.com/smash.html <-- can someone tell me why that function isnt working for the input field? id like the function to check if the keyboard was smashed on input[P
[16:43:31] <testcase> ajpiano, are you aware of any low level firefox bugs that could be causing it? im using jquery latest off google CDN, and firefox 8 is in stable.
[16:43:34] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Can you try explaining that again
[16:43:40] <dogarrhea2> are you Scott Gonzalez?
[16:44:01] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: no
[16:44:02] <nisseni> Eviltwin: I'm making a $.post with some data to a file named contact-form.php - I see the post in firefox, but how do I echo the data?
[16:44:04] <Eviltwin> testcase: What was the issue and have you isolated the relevant code?
[16:44:13] <Eviltwin> nisseni: The response?
[16:44:19] <dogarrhea2> oops i mistook your afro for his..
[16:44:20] <testcase> yes, I have isolated it down to the $.each statement
[16:44:29] <testcase> pastebin.com/p5U0NX7F
[16:44:30] <nisseni> Eviltwin: yeah...
[16:44:40] <JohnnyM> hmm
[16:44:41] <dogarrhea2> Adam Sontang
[16:44:44] <Eviltwin> testcase: So instead of function() { ... you want function(data) { ...
[16:44:47] <Eviltwin> And data is the server that came back
[16:44:58] <testcase> which line?
[16:45:10] <ajpiano> testcase: that's a lot of other code besides just a $.each
[16:45:15] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: yes
[16:45:18] <Eviltwin> testcase: What's $.publish?
[16:45:36] <testcase> its pub/sub model, look at the trace output though, you will see why I have whiddled it down to that
[16:45:41] <testcase> http://pastebin.com/V74thpwy
[16:46:00] <ajpiano> testcase: a live demo helps us a lot more
[16:46:00] <Eviltwin> This data is pretty meaningless to me
[16:46:06] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net
[16:46:06] <testcase> go to mlspage.com
[16:46:12] <testcase> in firefox 8
[16:46:23] <testcase> point it to star, ID
[16:46:40] <Eviltwin> Okay
[16:47:05] <imsky> wednesday night waa
[16:47:09] <testcase> the end result is properties are duplicating.
[16:47:26] <testcase> what I have posted is where it was traced to
[16:47:45] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ testcase
[16:47:46] <bot-t> testcase, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[16:48:18] <Eviltwin> If it's a jQuery bug, it shouldn't require anything other than jQuery
[16:48:35] <testcase> I did whiddle it down to a function. but its going to be really difficult to produce a test case for it given the complexity of the application.
[16:48:44] <Eviltwin> Any of the functions you use should be JavaScript, your own, or listed on api.jquery.com
[16:49:00] <testcase> It may or may not have to do with jquery, but it IS firefox specific and the end result is that $.each() is iterating twice for each index
[16:49:18] <testcase> im simply asking what could be causing that to happen
[16:49:43] <Eviltwin> Where is that each on the live site
[16:49:46] <Eviltwin> What filename / line number
[16:49:52] <testcase> map.js
[16:50:10] <Eviltwin> Line?
[16:50:17] <ajpiano> aren't you talking about search.js?
[16:50:21] <ajpiano> line 104ish?
[16:50:32] <testcase> sounds about right
[16:50:33] <nisseni> Eviltwin: anything?
[16:50:37] <testcase> sorry, yes its search.js
[16:50:41] <Eviltwin> How does ajpiano know your code better than you? :P
[16:50:51] <testcase> lol, fresh eyes :)
[16:50:53] <ajpiano> testcase: i just stepped through that code
[16:50:59] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Targeted the wrong person
[16:51:00] <ajpiano> i got 29 elements in the array
[16:51:03] <ajpiano> and it did the loop 29 times
[16:51:05] <ajpiano> in firefox 8
[16:51:10] <nisseni> Eviltwin: okey
[16:51:12] <testcase> so it didnt reproduce duplicate properties for you?
[16:51:13] <Eviltwin> nisseni: So instead of function() { ... you want function(data) { ...
[16:51:19] <ajpiano> nope
[16:51:21] <Eviltwin> nisseni: And you want to look at that "data"
[16:51:35] <testcase> ugh, this is irritating, it seems like some systems get different responses.
[16:51:40] <diverdud`> if onload is document ready in jquery, what is then onunload _
[16:51:43] <diverdud`> -
[16:51:47] <diverdud`> ?
[16:51:57] <testcase> ive tested the data coming in, and it has the proper number of elements.
[16:52:01] <nisseni> Eviltwin: ah, thanks a lot!
[16:52:02] <ajpiano> diverdud`: onload "isn't" document ready
[16:52:20] <ajpiano> document ready is document ready, window.load is window.load, and window.onbeforeunload and window.onunload continue to be those things
[16:52:24] <diverdud`> ajpiano: hmm ok...but almost the same_
[16:52:29] <diverdud`> ?
[16:52:33] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs
[16:52:33] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[16:52:48] <ajpiano> diverdud`: you can do $(window).bind("onbeforeunload",fn)
[16:52:55] <ajpiano> we don't have anything special in jquery for page unloading
[16:53:30] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I think he wants an event to be triggered a second before the user closes the page
[16:53:35] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Why doesn't jQuery support that?
[16:53:35] <ajpiano> testcase: unless you can, well... provide a more synthesised test case, i don't know if you'll be able to find much help from jquery or mozilla
[16:53:42] <diverdud`> ajpiano: and the $(window).bind("onbeforeunload",fn) is dont in document ready+
[16:54:00] <Eviltwin> testcase: Yeah, you really need to pin this down to the very specific issue
[16:54:17] <xcoderzach> testcase: I don't know what to look for on that page
[16:54:36] <testcase> thanks for your help ajpiano. yea, this bugs all thats left from launch, and its just boggling me.
[16:54:44] <Eviltwin> testcase: Does "has results, coming in" get doubled?
[16:54:50] <testcase> nope
[16:55:15] <testcase> thats how I "whiddled it down", process_search only shows once, "has results, coming in" only once, but then it repeats saying the index twice.
[16:55:21] <testcase> there is only one subscriber to that function.
[16:55:52] <Eviltwin> testcase: Try throwing in a for(var k in data.results) console.log([k,data.results[k],data.hasOwnProperty(k)]) before the each
[16:55:54] <testcase> Im going to try console.log() on the data
[16:56:07] <Eviltwin> Wait...
[16:56:11] <Eviltwin> You haven't console.log'd the data yet?
[16:56:20] <Eviltwin> And you came running to us saying there's a jQuery bug?
[16:56:22] <testcase> no I did earlier on, it was coming in sane
[16:56:52] <Eviltwin> testcase: For objects, $.each users a for(var key in object) structure
[16:56:57] <Eviltwin> So adding what I wrote may help shed some light
[16:57:18] <testcase> hmm... are 1 and "1" different indexes perhaps?
[16:57:24] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:57:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[16:57:42] <Eviltwin> Depending on how it's structured
[16:57:50] <testcase> I could see this being a bug in FF. im going to delve deeper into the data
[16:58:21] <Eviltwin> Normally object[1] and object["1"] are the same thing but you can get some weirdness
[16:58:29] <Eviltwin> In terms of iterating over the keys
[16:59:30] <Eviltwin> All keys should be strings in an object
[17:00:27] <Eviltwin> Anyway I promised myself I'd actually get some work done tonight instead of spending the whole evening in #jquery
[17:00:35] <Eviltwin> So I'm going to AFK from IRC for the evening
[17:00:45] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[17:00:46] <svcghost> cya
[17:00:49] <svcghost> cya
[17:00:51] <svcghost> cya
[17:00:52] <svcghost> wtf
[17:01:16] <testcase> great, added a console.log before it, and now the error is not occuring....
[17:01:22] <testcase> now im scared.
[17:05:24] <testcase> data.results is right (number of elements, no duplicates)
[17:11:08] <dnyy> what library is most used for ajax file uploads?
[17:14:13] <coldhead> ?g uploadify @ dnyy
[17:14:14] <bot-t> dnyy, JQuery File Upload Plugin Script - Uploadify - http://www.uploadify.com/
[17:14:23] <coldhead> and the newer hot thing is
[17:14:30] <coldhead> ?g blueimp jquery upload @ dnyy
[17:14:31] <bot-t> dnyy, blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - GitHub - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[17:14:34] <dnyy> coldhead: don't need anything that complex though, no need for extra UI or anything
[17:14:50] <coldhead> you just asked what was popular
[17:14:55] <coldhead> :)
[17:15:11] <dnyy> coldhead: true :p
[17:15:41] <coldhead> try the blueimp one, that can look pretty minimal
[17:15:52] <ajpiano> dnyy: the jquery form plugin handles fire uploads with no extra ui
[17:16:04] <ajpiano> it just makes it so the "ajax post" is to an iframe instead of over xhr
[17:19:15] <someprimetime> how can i bind either an onFocus or keyup to an input field?
[17:19:30] <dnyy> ajpiano: this one? http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[17:19:35] <ajpiano> yep
[17:19:48] <dnyy> ajpiano: thanks :)
[17:20:24] <joosy> what's the conventional way to include dependencies in a jquery plugin?
[17:20:43] <ajpiano> there isn't one
[17:21:00] <joosy> ajpiano: what would you do?
[17:21:11] <dnyy> i wish there was a package manager style thing for jquery ;(
[17:21:36] <ajpiano> we are actually planning to introduce a package.json
[17:21:43] <ajpiano> that will allow for dependency listing
[17:21:51] <dnyy> that would be A+
[17:21:53] <ajpiano> not sure if we're gonna have a cli too to go along with it
[17:22:07] <dnyy> ajpiano: how else would it be used if not through cli?
[17:22:39] <ajpiano> the metadata provided in it will be used to drive the plugin site, essentially
[17:22:49] <ajpiano> i don't imagine a cli tool on top of it would be trivial
[17:22:56] <ajpiano> i mean, i magine it *would* be trivial
[17:23:24] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-plugins/blob/master/docs/json.md
[17:23:35] <dnyy> yeah, but how would a user get the dependencies using the package.json?
[17:23:35] <pinholecamera> anyone know why this bit of mouseover code wouldn't work when i try to defer JS loading to after page render? it's got a doc ready, so not sure why it'd be misfiring
[17:23:48] <pinholecamera> no errors... i assume it's just not finding it in the dom?
[17:23:55] <joosy> actually that question is set up for you to tell me that all projects are different. i only have a few files along with the ui.widget.js. i was planning on minifying them together with the closure compiler but i also wanted to let the user have access to the uncompiled code as well for development.
[17:24:11] <ajpiano> joosy: typically, in the present day, you'd just supply all the files uncompressed..
[17:24:12] <pinholecamera> http://pastebin.com/0tzPtkz4
[17:24:30] <ajpiano> and then yeah, they'd be concatted together by the user's build process
[17:24:42] <joosy> and make the user include them?
[17:24:50] <danheberden> and eventually we'd have the option to retrieve those files
[17:24:52] <pinholecamera> i thought it was maybe because it was appending it below the analytics code, but no dice
[17:25:11] <pinholecamera> it's funny because all the other JS in the file i'm deferring works fine
[17:25:12] <danheberden> so if you referenced ben alman's throttle plugin as a dependancy, the plugins site would get it for you
[17:25:13] <joosy> ah, should i not even bother with a minified version then?
[17:25:46] <ajpiano> to "appeal" to the widest base, you'd want to ship a .min.js as well,
[17:25:55] <ajpiano> so people who don't have a build process can get that
[17:25:58] <joosy> okay, sounds good thanks
[17:26:40] <joosy> i shouldn't include jquery in that .min.js file right?
[17:26:50] <ajpiano> definitely not
[17:27:18] <ajpiano> dnyy: we also might look at just working in tandem with https://github.com/kriszyp/cpm
[17:28:01] <dnyy> ajpiano: seems like a good route to me
[17:32:55] <ajpiano> dnyy: for what it's worth, if you have any interest in getting involved with helping us with that tooling
[17:33:05] <ajpiano> it's an excellent moment in time to mention that
[17:41:34] <pamelafoxx> looking for some CSS expertise -- i dont want to show text in a div if its going to be partially cut off - like in the bottom div here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/ae.png ...whats a good way of detecting that? (the text is arbitrary)
[17:41:34] <sunscreen> I want to dynamically generate 10 green blocks inside a div that is around 150x150 px
[17:42:22] <bobdobbs> pamelafoxx: css overflow property?
[17:42:47] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: you have to stick it into the dom offscreen into an element that's the same width, get it's height, and compare :/
[17:42:48] <pamelafoxx> thats overflow: hidden -- and it does hide it, but halfway through the 3rd line of text
[17:43:09] <pamelafoxx> ah. i see what you mean.
[17:43:32] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: also what about text-overflow
[17:43:39] <pamelafoxx> okay ill try that. sucks that css cant do it on its own.
[17:43:44] <pamelafoxx> text-overflow is ellipsis there
[17:44:26] <sunscreen> I want to dynamically generate 10 green blocks inside a div that is around 150x150 px stacked vertically.. how would you guys tackle that?
[17:48:21] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano okay so now ive calculated its offscreen height and can see its too big. can i detect at which point in the string to brreak it?
[17:49:02] <ajpiano> hmm, i can think of some pretty gross things you could try
[17:49:30] <ajpiano> whenever i used to want to do this i'd just shorten by number of characters rather than length
[17:49:46] <ajpiano> like, physical length
[17:50:08] <joosy> is there a "conventional" way to have static methods for plugins? using the widget factory?
[17:50:27] <joosy> right now i'm just tacking on a traditional plugin to $.pluginName
[17:51:06] <ajpiano> ostensibly $.your.widget.staticMethod would be it?
[17:51:11] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano yeah..i could do that..i jus want it to be as least awkward truncation as possible.. ill tinker. i could test out different combos in a while loop offscreen, but that is gross.
[17:52:04] <Casey> How can I run some jQuery only for print, like a print stylesheet in css
[17:52:36] <deadmau5> does jquery have some kind of method for say
[17:52:44] <deadmau5> foo.append(bar) and bar having .toJquery() or something?
[17:52:51] <deadmau5> to return bar.el
[17:53:00] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: i have trouble believing we're the first peeople trying to solve this though
[17:53:07] <ajpiano> i wonder if anyone else has a good solution
[17:53:18] <pamelafoxx> there goes my hope of being a pioneer
[17:53:34] <pamelafoxx> its one of those things thats hard to search for. non-obvious keywords.
[17:53:38] <ajpiano> deadmau5: use bar.appendTo(el);
[17:53:52] <deadmau5> damn
[17:54:15] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: why is text-overflow being... in the middle of the word
[17:54:51] <pamelafoxx> what it looks like without text-overflow: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/ag.png
[17:54:55] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-text-truncate/
[17:55:32] <bonhoffer> is there a way to remove an option from select with jquery?
[17:56:01] <imsky> yes
[17:56:17] <ajpiano> pamelafoxx: also just found https://github.com/tagedieb/jquery-truncate
[17:56:22] <bonhoffer> $('#select.user_id').delete_option('foo')
[17:56:26] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano thanks, checking out now
[17:56:36] <nickadeemus2002> @bonhoffer  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/375508/removing-an-item-from-a-select-box
[17:56:48] <bonhoffer> thanks!
[17:56:55] <Casey> Is it possible to only apply jQuery when a page is being printed?
[17:59:33] <ajpiano> Casey: i'm unaware of anyone having done so
[18:03:46] <sirtophat> I'm appending to the same div multiple times, using position:relative, but somehow each is taking the positions of the div before it, not the parent
[18:04:00] <sirtophat> so when it should just keep putting more of the same image on top of itself it just adds down
[18:09:17] <pamelafoxx> @ajpiano those both deal only with constrained width, not height. im gonna try the simple if-offscreen-div-is-big-truncate-to-X-chars approach for now. thnx muchly for talking through it with me.
[18:09:52] <ajpiano> i have a jq plugin thing i one wrote lying around somewhere

[18:38:57] <gdoteof> i am using jquery.draggable; or more accurately, a module for drupal 7 that uses it.  i am having an issue with not being able to drag things into certain regions
[18:39:23] <gdoteof> or maybe just past a certain X coordinate and it is a coincidence that it won't go to the region
[18:39:42] <gdoteof> i am not really sure where to look to debug this; wondering if someone could point me in the right direction
[18:40:15] <gdoteof> i drag from the left to the right.. and it just sort of gets to a certain point and won't go further
[18:40:16] <berndj> is the verboten region perhaps a Droppable that's denying the drag?
[18:40:54] <guyver_007> border 1px red to see how big the draggin container is
[18:41:04] <gdoteof> berndj: no.. because i can drop into a different region and then i go into the verboten region fine
[18:41:29] <gdoteof> and it won't actually even move; it just gets stuck at a certain x coordinate while my mouse keeps moving
[18:41:51] <gdoteof> so what i mean is that i can drop it out of the original region, pick it back up, and then it will go fine into the forbidden area
[18:42:03] <guyver_007> padding or margin overlapping the dragging area possibly
[18:42:40] <gdoteof> guyver_007: good call i will try that
[18:45:40] <gdoteof> guyver_007: seems to be the expected area that has the border
[18:51:46] <gdoteof> is there some way i can profile to see what it is running up against?
[18:51:56] <gdoteof> i am just not even sure what to look for
[18:54:36] <guyver_007> are you using live?
[18:55:41] <someprimetime> how can i set a timer on a function?
[18:58:52] <guyver_007> setsetTimeout(function() { //you crap
[18:58:54] <guyver_007> }, 500);setTimeout(function() { //you crap
[19:00:43] <donCams> hi. i have $('someelement').click(function(e){e.preventDefault(); return false;}); but why is the page still going up when I click? any way I can debug this?
[19:03:28] <finlay> noob here, I'm using jquery ui tabs, they are working, but I want to add this code: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-tabs-create-an-anchor-to-content-within-tab#14737000001187015   but it doesn't work. any chance someone could mention what is wrong with it pretty please?
[19:06:19] <gdoteof> maybe i can add an event listener; i don't suppose there is some event i can listen for when an item reaches it's boundary?
[19:06:37] <gdoteof> or maybe i can just inspect the element itself as soon as it starts getting dragged; maybe there is some metadata attached to it?
[19:09:01] <guyver_007> try using the console log
[19:11:10] <c_t_montgomery> donCams: make sure jQuery is loading. open up your web inspector (or firebug or something similar), and make sure there aren't any errors in your js file
[19:13:55] <finlay> noob here, I'm using jquery ui tabs, they are working, but I want #anchor to go to the tab that contains them, trying to follow this example but it's not working: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-tabs-create-an-anchor-to-content-within-tab#14737000001187015   any chance someone could give me a hand pretty please?
[19:21:50] <gdoteof> guyver_007: i am successfully inspecting the element when i start to drag it; any ideas on how to check why it won't go further
[19:29:42] <guyver_007> test link?
[19:32:07] <Whirl3d> evening all. How do you determine if a string passed to a function is supposed to be a decimal or integer?
[19:33:09] <Whirl3d> I've tried: var int=parseInt(param); if (int!==Number.NaN) { must not be a number...
[19:37:08] <Whirl3d> nvm
[19:40:26] <Spinkzeit> Anyone know of a good horizontal infinite scrolling script?
[19:40:39] <kurol> that kinda sounds dirty
[19:41:02] <Spinkzeit> Yup, client won't listen, not my problem :)
[19:41:29] <kurol> oh... what i meant to type is, "that's what she said"
[19:41:48] <Spinkzeit> Shouldn't I of been the one to write that after your first sentence?
[19:42:40] <kurol> idk. i'm trying to debug this other person's jquery plugin that only doesn't work in firefox so i'm not really paying attention.
[19:43:22] <Spinkzeit> I can't relate
[19:43:30] <Spinkzeit> Works in IE but not FF?
[19:43:34] <Spinkzeit> What is the world coming to
[20:19:00] <dogarrhea2> what exactly is the ui object in these event listeners that look like function(anEvent,ui)
[20:32:38] <Hypersapien> I'm using the jquery version of tinymce. I'm trying to figure out how to get the value out in xml encoded form.
[20:33:34] <igcewieling> I'm a jQuery n00b, but find it very useful.  I have a customer information form and I would like to make a "non-form" version to attach to an e-mail message.  Does anyone have any ideas on how jQuery can help?
[20:33:58] <bobdobbs> Is that really a jquery problem?
[20:34:09] <Whirl3d> Though I think this is better done in php, you *could* do it in jquery
[20:34:41] <dogarrhea2> ok figured it out
[20:34:43] <igcewieling> bobdobbs, jquery has helped with every problem I've thrown at it.  I use the .form() and various other stuff.
[20:34:53] <Whirl3d> Hypersapien, never used jquery version of tinyMCE
[20:34:54] <dogarrhea2> ui.draggable, ui.droppable, ui.rapeable etc. etc.
[20:34:55] <bobdobbs> ok
[20:35:29] <Whirl3d> but are you sending your form to a php script on the server that mails the contents of the form?
[20:36:07] <igcewieling> Whirl3d: yes.  I can do it in php, but the page is already all laid out, I just wish I could make a "snapshot of it".
[20:36:57] <rookie84> how can i keep a state of a variable in jquery/javascript
[20:37:12] <rookie84> for example if i want a button to iteratively select <li> elements
[20:37:24] <Whirl3d> You could technically use .clone() to clone to clone the form, then iterate through the inputs/buttons/textareas to make them disabled and readonly, then append that to your submit function. But that would really be a pain in arse.
[20:37:56] <rookie84> whirl3d: let me show you my code.
[20:38:07] <rookie84> just learning :)
[20:38:16] <Whirl3d> rookie84, sorry that was for igcewieling....
[20:38:23] <igcewieling> Whirl3d: I suspected as much.  I was using the wrong search terms, I started searching for jequery snapshot and have gotten useful results.  off to research.
[20:38:31] <rookie84> i thought so :)
[20:38:37] <rookie84> http://pastebin.com/b3hQZiEd
[20:38:45] <Whirl3d> rookie84, check out the $.data() object.
[20:39:11] <rookie84> i want one button, you click on it and each <li> gets highlighted
[20:40:14] <Whirl3d> rookie84, try using next...
[20:40:17] <rookie84> hmm i thought there woudl be some easy way.
[20:40:59] <rookie84> $('#show').click(function(e) { 			$('ul li:next').css("background","yellow");
[20:41:01] <rookie84> this doesn't work
[20:41:58] <Whirl3d> rookie84, like $("#show").click(function (e) {var items=$("ul li"); var nextItem=items.filter(".highlight').next(); nextItem.css("background","yellow").addClass('highlight"); });
[20:42:17] <rookie84> thanks, let me check
[20:42:47] <Whirl3d> rookie84, I forgot to check for the first highlight. Lemme show you in jsfiddle. brb
[20:42:54] <rookie84> ok
[20:48:04] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/kYDbX/6/
[20:48:47] <Whirl3d> now you could write that in just a couple of lines, but I wanted to illustrate the logic steps.
[20:51:53] <rookie84> ok great
[20:51:58] <rookie84> thanks!
[20:52:03] <Whirl3d> np
[20:52:21] <rookie84> anotehr question is i unselect all the li's (like remove the .highlight class)
[20:52:29] <rookie84> how do i check if an element has a particular class?
[20:52:53] <Cork> ?.hasClass @ rookie84
[20:52:54] <bot-t> rookie84, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[20:52:57] <Whirl3d> $("."+classname) will select it. or $(elem).hasClass(classname);
[20:53:01] <rookie84> wow great
[20:53:03] <rookie84> thanks
[20:58:57] <mehaaz> I have a link which looks like this: <a href="user.php?time=4156&height=600&width=800">
[20:59:16] <mehaaz> now, is it possible to make the "time" var change somehow in the code?
[20:59:45] <mehaaz> or better yet, how can I change the a href attribute in jquery
[20:59:48] <Whirl3d> you could manipulate it as a string
[21:00:02] <Whirl3d> $("a").attr("href",newhref);
[21:01:06] <mehaaz> ah this channel is gold, thanks will try that
[21:01:27] <Whirl3d> mehaaz, but that will change all the anchor href attributes...give it an id or a class to select it easier and then use .attr("href") to retrieve the href value and .attr("href",newValue) to set it
[21:02:40] <mehaaz> ah ok
[21:04:12] <mehaaz> <a href=""> xxxx </a>
[21:04:21] <mehaaz> what var can i reach xxx at?
[21:04:29] <Whirl3d> $("a").text();
[21:05:22] <Whirl3d> mehaaz, like $("a").text("something"); to set it and $("a").text() to read it
[21:05:39] <bobdobbs> might sound silly, but is there a jquery alternative to setTimeout ?
[21:05:55] <dismist> delay but it doesnt work the same way
[21:06:14] <Whirl3d> bobdobbs, why?
[21:06:53] <bobdobbs> Whirl3d: partly just curious. Partly, cos I'm wondering if there is a way to pass multiple functions to setTimeout.
[21:07:20] <Whirl3d> wrap them in an anonymous function
[21:07:35] <Cork> bobdobbs: you can do it through a seris of .queue().delay().unqueue
[21:07:50] <cmotDibbler> hey guys
[21:07:55] <Cork> bobdobbs: but i would prob use setTimeout
[21:07:56] <Whirl3d> var t=setTimeout(function() {doFunc(); doFunc3(); etc},2000)
[21:08:04] <bobdobbs> Ah! Theres something called .queue! That might help with my current task
[21:08:11] <bobdobbs> checking docs now...
[21:08:12] <Cork> ?.queue
[21:08:13] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[21:08:23] <bobdobbs> :)
[21:08:33] <mgauthier> Is this the right channel for jquery mobile?
[21:08:54] <Whirl3d> mgauthier, try #jquerymobile, most likely
[21:09:19] <qawsedrf> i want to bind an event to a pseudo class (div:after), how d i do it ?
[21:09:20] <Whirl3d> you might find some people who could help here, but I'd check there first
[21:09:49] <Whirl3d> ?.bind@qawsedrf
[21:09:50] <bot-t> qawsedrf, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[21:10:14] <qawsedrf> i tried $('div:after').click(function() {}); but i dont think it works
[21:10:23] <Whirl3d> what is :after?
[21:11:37] <qawsedrf> you dont know about :after and :before in css ?
[21:11:50] <Whirl3d> better yet, i don't know css.
[21:11:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[21:12:18] <coldhead> -_-
[21:12:22] <bobdobbs> qawsedrf: You can use the firebug console to check to see if your selector returns anything. That might help to diagnose
[21:12:48] <Whirl3d> coldhead! Good evening.
[21:12:59] <bobdobbs> qawsedrf: Like, enter $('div:after'), and just see if you get an empty set or not
[21:13:08] <coldhead> hello, css ignoramus
[21:13:17] <coldhead> :P
[21:13:31] <bobdobbs> qawsedrf: If what you get back isn't empty, then you have successfully grabbed something.
[21:13:43] <Whirl3d> I know enough to get me into trouble. But the second I think I got it, wrong...everything's a mess.
[21:13:50] <qawsedrf> yeh, empty array
[21:14:06] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:14:44] <Whirl3d> ?.append
[21:14:44] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[21:19:01] <Whirl3d> :after sounds like more css tomfoolery. blech. if you are looking for the first element "after" a selector, you can find that using .next()...but to bind an event to something to be added after an element seems like two steps...append the new content, then bind to the new content
[21:19:39] <qawsedrf> lol
[21:26:44] <Whirl3d> is there an easy way to convert a string representation of an array into an array? "['one','two','three']"--> ["one","two","three"] without splitting and all that...
[21:29:01] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: JSON.parse(arr)
[21:29:28] <sethuhdiah> anybody have experience/recommendations on a calendar plugin?
[21:30:00] <crab> sethu: jquery ui's datepicker is nice
[21:30:22] <sethuhdiah> looking for something more like google calendar
[21:30:33] <crab> don't know what that is, sorry.
[21:30:48] <sethuhdiah> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[21:30:56] <sethuhdiah> looks ok to me
[21:31:35] <crab> problem solved!
[21:31:57] <sethuhdiah> potentially
[21:33:08] <Whirl3d> sanjayb, I just wrote a String.prototype.toArray method...works great, but thanks.
[21:35:48] <bobdobbs> Again, dumb question, but should I be able to use queue() to make things happen in sequence? One after the other?
[21:38:34] <Whirl3d> I think the idea behind .queue was to be used for animation sequences...so I haven't used them much to be honest.
[21:38:55] <Cork> bobdobbs: yes
[21:39:10] <Cork> bobdobbs: queue generates a list of functions that will be called
[21:39:21] <Cork> they won't be called automatically though
[21:39:41] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:39:55] <Cork> .delay, .animate, .show and so on calls .unqueue when they'r done
[21:40:23] <Cork> but if you add your own queue, you need to unqueue the next command for the chain to continue
[21:40:36] <bobdobbs> hm...
[21:40:39] <bobdobbs> digesting
[21:40:48] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could use defferreds...
[21:41:17] <Cork> defered doesn't delay a command action
[21:41:35] <Cork> it just allow you to attach the function after the command
[21:41:44] <Cork> *callback
[21:41:57] <Whirl3d> and update functions
[21:42:26] <Whirl3d> bobdobb, what are you trying to accomplish, really?
[21:43:32] <Cork> Whirl3d: stors all given callbacks, it doen't update

[21:45:31] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky i miss his wiggles
[21:45:31] <bot-t> (53 hours 30 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn black friday weekend was awesome though
[21:45:32] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[21:45:37] <bobdobbs> Here is what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/297Pe/
[21:45:52] <bobdobbs> but the inner function isn't being called
[21:45:56] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky black friday/cyber monday sukk'd. Mostly because of all the customers at work.
[21:45:57] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[21:46:55] <bobdobbs> So, I want to sequentially, first  fade in one element, and then fade in another.
[21:47:35] <Cork> queue can't help you there
[21:47:43] <bobdobbs> Ah, ok
[21:47:47] <Cork> hmm yes it can...
[21:47:49] <Cork> sorry ;P
[21:47:50] <bobdobbs> oh
[21:48:03] <Cork> but it won't make much difference
[21:48:08] <bobdobbs> no ?
[21:48:11] <Cork> whats wrong with the code you have?
[21:48:24] <Whirl3d> you need a time interval for your fade function.
[21:48:28] <bobdobbs> hm
[21:48:29] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:48:52] <Cork> Whirl3d: duration is optional
[21:49:07] <Whirl3d> plus, I haven't trusted jquery's builtin fade functions since I got burned with a bug...i use animate exclusively, really.
[21:49:07] <bobdobbs> using setTimeout worked. It worked inside a queue call as well... but it seems kinda wrong
[21:50:04] <bobdobbs> It works, but I don't see why the need to use a timer exists
[21:51:21] <Cork> bobdobbs: http://jsfiddle.net/297Pe/1/ WFM'
[21:51:22] <Eviltwin> What's up?
[21:51:36] <Cork> bobdobbs: whats the problem with the code you pasted?
[21:52:04] <Cork> opps forgot to remove a change i did http://jsfiddle.net/297Pe/2/
[21:52:48] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/297Pe/3/
[21:53:51] <ddoom> Is it possible to have both an onclick and a .click() event on an <a> ?
[21:53:53] <bobdobbs> hmmm. odd. I must have broken something in the surrounding code.
[21:54:11] <Cork> ddoom: when you add onclick it will reset all event listners
[21:54:21] <ddoom> Cork: Ok thats what I thought, thanks
[21:54:57] <gdoteof> dkddd
[21:57:35] <Whirl3d> bobdobbs, http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/297Pe/8/
[21:57:52] <bobdobbs> ta
[21:58:09] <bobdobbs> cool
[21:58:11] <bobdobbs> damn
[21:59:35] <Cork> bobdobbs: that doesn't run "when done" though
[21:59:46] <bobdobbs> right
[21:59:52] <Cork> it just caclulates expected ends
[22:00:35] <bobdobbs> Yeah, I'm still having trouble applying these things to my code. I'll upload to show you what the problem is. Bear in mind - the design isn't mine...
[22:02:25] <bobdobbs> Cork: http://adroit.sunil.co.nz/experience.html
[22:03:45] <bobdobbs> Cork: If you click on 'residential' in the menu, the big background image should change
[22:04:07] <bobdobbs> The existing image should fade out, and be replaced by grey background image
[22:04:33] <bobdobbs> shortly after that, a color version of the same image should fade in
[22:04:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/297Pe/16/
[22:05:01] <Whirl3d> bobdobbs, that uses timeout and only fires once each one is complete.
[22:06:00] <bobdobbs> I se
[22:06:36] <bobdobbs> I guess I could just use setTimeout, but still, it seems... I dunno - wrong.
[22:06:57] <Cork> bobdobbs: don't see the need for it
[22:07:06] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:07:17] <Cork> what you want to do is use .delay() before your second fadein
[22:07:29] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:07:39] <bobdobbs> checking out the api now...
[22:07:49] <Cork> you still need to relay on the callback from th fadein's when you change object
[22:08:09] <Cork> but fadein respects .delay()
[22:08:32] <bobdobbs> I'm not quiet sure what oyu mean by changing objects
[22:09:12] <bobdobbs> ... but I'll delay a shot
[22:12:50] <dbz> hi i am having a jquery issue where i cannot submit a ajax post request, i will get a jsfiddle example in a second :-)
[22:13:05] <bobdobbs> Cork: thanks man. that does it. setdelay ftw
[22:13:41] <Cork> bobdobbs: sorry i meant change element
[22:13:50] <bobdobbs> k
[22:13:52] <Cork> bobdobbs: ya delay is nice for animations :)
[22:14:38] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/297Pe/17/
[22:14:44] <Eviltwin> Done the "right" way
[22:14:57] <bobdobbs> hm...
[22:15:10] <Cork> uh...
[22:15:27] <Cork> he wants to fade two elements, that feels a bit overcoded...
[22:16:08] <Eviltwin> Cork: Good thing to know
[22:16:09] <ldexterldesign> sup guys. anyone know a decent auto complete plugin?
[22:16:13] <Eviltwin> Chaining n callbacks
[22:16:21] <ldexterldesign> ... like a search filter
[22:16:26] <bobdobbs> I see that you guys are using opacity to hide the elements initially. Is there a good reason to use that over 'display none', or 'visibility hidden' ?
[22:16:30] <ldexterldesign> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete demo doesn't work
[22:16:51] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: You can't animate those
[22:16:52] <Cork> bobdobbs: they take up the intended space
[22:17:01] <bobdobbs> ok
[22:17:04] <ldexterldesign> oh, http://plugins.jquery.com/ is down - that'll be why
[22:17:05] <Eviltwin> They can be done after
[22:17:08] <Eviltwin> Or before
[22:17:09] <Cork> bobdobbs: and fadein sets opacity to 0 before it starts
[22:17:15] <bobdobbs> ah
[22:17:17] <Cork> animate needs 0
[22:17:19] <bobdobbs> that's good to know
[22:17:36] <bobdobbs> I should change my css
[22:17:55] <dbz> jsfiddle is at http://jsfiddle.net/LymqK/
[22:17:57] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: .animate works by tweening some number from what is what you specify
[22:19:11] <bobdobbs> I see
[22:19:15] <Eviltwin> Meaning if you do $("div").css("opacity",0).animate({opacity:1}) sets the opacity to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 etc over time
[22:19:22] <Eviltwin> It actually makes significantly smaller steps
[22:19:28] <Eviltwin> And they're not usually "clean" numbers
[22:19:33] <Eviltwin> But they're exact numbers
[22:19:49] <Eviltwin> With the appropriate plugins, you can fade hex colors
[22:19:56] <bobdobbs> interesting
[22:19:58] <Eviltwin> But that's because it translates them to numbers and back
[22:20:10] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[22:21:58] <ldexterldesign> is http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ the best autocomplete plugin?
[22:22:05] <Eviltwin> It's a good one
[22:22:21] <Cork> ldexterldesign: it depends on if you need jquery ui
[22:22:34] <Cork> *for other things
[22:22:47] <ldexterldesign> Cork: i have it installed in this project
[22:22:57] <Cork> then yes its the best one
[22:23:00] <ldexterldesign> Cork: it's not a production site anyway
[22:23:10] <ldexterldesign> Cork: cheers
[22:23:21] <Cork> there are other ones thats good, but no need to add another one
[22:23:25] <ldexterldesign> Cork: do you know/have you used any others?
[22:23:39] <Cork> i use another my self
[22:23:46] <Cork> had it from before it existed
[22:24:32] <Cork> ldexterldesign: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/
[22:25:02] <ldexterldesign> Cork: mmm, deprecated now though
[22:25:07] <Cork> ya
[22:25:25] <Cork> but it still works well, and if you don't need ui its small and nice

[23:45:26] <richardr> I have scope issues with a jQuery plugin I'm building. It has a couple of methods, init, swap, append, render, etc. By default, it renders. But optionally it might need to swap/append content depending on listening to events. For example pagination. At the moment I'm trying to pass the events as a second param to the plugin, as a callback and just setting up custom logic/events BUT I don't have scope in there so I can't call swap/append. Any help highly ap
