[00:00:10] <phrearch> isnt that a markup problem rather?
[00:00:23] <phrearch> i mean styling problem
[00:01:53] <rosieres> phrearch: not really, because the tooltips are very big . . . and must run over the content area . . .
[00:02:38] <phrearch> rosieres: cant you use z-index for that?
[00:04:20] <rosieres> phrearch : ever tried an z-index over an iFrame . . .  i guess that doesn´t work !
[00:04:34] <phrearch> ive used iframes and z-index some time ago to create a tabbed browsing thing in ie6. worked ok
[00:05:46] <rosieres> the tooltips are within the iFrame so the z-index has here no effect . . .
[00:06:03] <phrearch> no indeed
[00:06:12] <phrearch> that would be a problem
[00:07:33] <Spadeski> How do i get site image in tooltips like google has ?
[00:07:46] <phrearch> hm, i want to trigger a contextmenu based on the dom content using data attributes. or more specifically one attribute. but one data attribute cant have multiple values right?
[00:07:58] <phrearch> like <div class='blog-article' data-trigger='delete-blog-article foobar'>
[00:10:49] <phrearch> it seems that data can contain json objects?
[00:10:55] <phrearch> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/942348/whats-the-best-way-to-store-multiple-values-for-jquerys-data
[00:11:17] <phrearch> what would be the syntax if i want to store the data the other way around? (from html)
[00:15:02] <phrearch> ah got it
[00:15:03] <phrearch> <div class='blog-article' data-trigger='{"delete":"delete-blog-article","create":"foobar"}'>
[00:50:45] <Amaraa> hi all
[00:51:19] <Amaraa> Is there good and latest slide about jquery
[00:54:19] <Amaraa> hello
[01:03:32] <datarecall> when i include jquery IE7 errors out ?
[01:07:04] <Clorith> Ok so my issues with the datepicker in IE8 are solved with some nifty fallbacks, but in IE7 the onSelect event doesn't trigger at all.
[01:08:00] <datarecall> Clorith when you load jquery min into IE7 does it give you errors
[01:08:25] <Clorith> no, there are no errors at all
[01:08:33] <datarecall> weird
[01:08:34] <coldhead> so everything is good!
[01:08:36] <coldhead> case closed!
[01:08:39] <coldhead> have a wonderful day
[01:09:59] <datarecall> as soon as i load jquery it gives me an error in IE7
[01:10:27] <Clorith> what kind of error ?
[01:10:51] <coldhead> fatal?
[01:10:56] <datarecall> yeah its crashes IE
[01:10:59] <datarecall> sec trying to grab it
[01:11:41] <datarecall> Expected Identifier, string or number
[01:11:44] <datarecall> line 11 char 9
[01:12:00] <datarecall> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> if i take that out error goes away
[01:12:19] <Clorith> yeah but what script do you actually have ?
[01:12:51] <datarecall> what do u mean
[01:12:55] <phrearch> hm, how can i process a selection of elements from $(ctx_target).find('.context-menu-option') ?
[01:13:16] <phrearch> store it in a var and then $.each ?
[01:13:37] <datarecall> cant you just go find.each ?
[01:14:55] <datarecall> removed every piece of js on the site but left the jquery lib include and same error
[01:14:59] <phrearch> not sure, dont need the collection as param then i suppose
[01:15:30] <datarecall> phrearch im pretty sure you can just do the find and each it,
[01:16:17] <phrearch> datarecall, yea seems to work. thanks
[01:17:16] <datarecall> np
[01:18:07] <Clorith> all I want is a big table showing functions and event handlers, and known incompatibilities, is that too much to ask for =(
[01:18:11] <Clorith> Stupid google.
[01:19:52] <snoy_ms> hey there. i try to collect some images into an array an only append it one time to the dom. http://pastebin.com/U9YAcSCz
[01:20:16] <snoy_ms> this doesn't work for me
[01:20:54] <Clorith> $('img'); to get the containers I believe
[01:20:58] <Clorith> no tags around it
[01:21:32] <Clorith> and this looks wrong, you want to loop through every <img> tag, if so doing $('img').each(function() { do stuff }); seems way more efficient
[01:21:49] <snoy_ms> Clorith: me ?
[01:21:53] <Clorith> Yes
[01:22:25] <phrearch> hm, data-context-id is converted to contextId when accessing jquery data
[01:22:41] <snoy_ms> I use for because its faster then each. I use the array to be faster with only one append. But my problem is, that it holds images objects that i can't append
[01:23:28] <snoy_ms> i use join because its faster then string concat. But how do i get the image into a sting...mhh
[01:24:17] <Johanderowan> hi, does anybody know of any e-mail or rss service which i can subscribe to and sends me updates of new jquery releases?
[01:24:48] <sean`> Johanderowan, you can subscribe to our blog
[01:24:53] <sean`> Or our github releases
[01:25:02] <sean`> comits*
[01:25:05] <sean`> comets?
[01:25:09] <sean`> NO, commits :D
[01:25:22] <Johanderowan> what blog?
[01:25:29] <Johanderowan> .blog.jquery.com?
[01:28:14] <fruitbat> Has anyone had chance to try my treeview plugin yet?
[01:28:29] <Clorith> treeview yo usay? I need one of those!
[01:28:47] <snoy_ms> i have an array with image objects. How can i append all these image objects in one step to the dom ?
[01:28:59] <Johanderowan> @sean: which blog do you mean?
[01:32:23] <sean`> Johanderowan, blog.jquery.com
[01:32:26] <sean`> and it's sean`
[01:33:54] <wwalser> snoy_ms: easiest way is to create an empty $('<div />'), append all of the images to said div $('<div />').append($myImages) then append the newly created div to the DOM $('<div />').append($myImages).appendTo('body')
[01:34:20] <snoy_ms> wwalser: that sound greats, thx :-)
[01:34:33] <snoy_ms> wwalser: its fast and easy
[01:34:42] <wwalser> if you want to get it there without the div you can unwrap it before appending to the DOM, or use a document fragment.
[01:34:53] <wwalser> no worries
[01:35:15] <snoy_ms> wwalser: i give it a tryâ€¦.
[01:36:12] <Johanderowan> @sean` i can't find where i can subscribe to the blog at blog.jquery.com...
[01:36:45] <sean`> Johanderowan, http://feeds.feedburner.com/jquery/
[01:37:16] <Johanderowan> thanks!
[01:37:27] <Johanderowan> couldn't find it on the site
[01:44:26] <_dave_h_d> hi all, is there a tool for javascript similar to php code sniffer which imposes coding standards of some sort
[01:44:54] <_dave_h_d> also, what are the most widely used coding standards for javascript out there, I know of jslint which is pretty neat
[01:47:11] <yn> How would you select a textarea that has a specific value?
[01:47:24] <yn> A specific form value that is
[01:48:11] <datarecall> find by .attr ?
[01:48:49] <yn> There is no built-in selector syntax for value of textarea?
[02:09:44] <ServerSage> yn: Are you trying to select a text area based on it's value?  Or are you trying to set the value of a text area?  If the latter you can use $('#textareaid').val('Value Goes Here');
[02:10:06] <yn> ServerStage: actually, the former
[02:11:48] <ServerSage> yn: I'm not sure there is a built in selector for values for any dom element.
[02:13:02] <yn> ServerSage: welll, there's :selected and :checked, which logically function like value selectors for form elements. Although I understand that they use different HTML attributes than a value match
[02:13:14] <ServerSage> yn: Have you tried $('input[value="whatever"]')
[02:14:58] <yn> ServerSage: yup, no dice. My current solution is the ugly $("textarea").filter(function() {return $(this).val() == "YourMom"});
[02:15:44] <ServerSage> $('textarea[value="YourMOm"]'
[02:15:52] <ServerSage> Oops, entered too soon, but you get the idea.
[02:16:42] <yn> ServerSage: yea, that def. doesn't work
[02:17:20] <ServerSage> yn: I'm sure somebody with a fresh brain will pipe in and tell you just how foolish I am and how to do it correctly.  Hehe.
[02:17:46] <yn> ServerSage: well thanks for the valiant attempt
[02:18:17] <ServerSage> yn: No problem, sorry I couldn't give you the shining beacon in the darkness.  But, it is 2:18am here.
[02:18:30] <yn> here as well
[02:19:41] <ServerSage> yn: You must be west coast then.
[02:19:50] <yn> yea. Berkeley
[02:20:40] <ServerSage> yn: Stones throw away.  I'm in Redwood City.
[02:20:50] <yn> Cool!
[02:21:28] <ServerSage> Small world.
[02:25:37] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys...can anyone tell me of an existing lightbox,greybox script that can support a description or maybe even html format?
[02:27:45] <sean`> Wiz_KeeD, google for prettyphoto
[02:27:48] <sean`> fancybox
[02:27:52] <sean`> colorbox
[02:28:00] <sean`> jquery ui dialog
[02:30:12] <Wiz_KeeD> prettyphoto?
[02:30:19] <Wiz_KeeD> colorbox?
[02:31:13] <sean`> google
[02:33:10] <Gavrisimo> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=colorbox
[02:33:42] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm
[02:33:57] <Wiz_KeeD> doesn't look that good...need space for a hefty description and a price tag
[02:36:58] <phrearch> ehm is there a selector option to check for attribute names available? like check if the element has attribute data-foobar
[02:37:37] <phrearch> ah nm. hasattr. i should rtfm
[02:38:10] <Gavrisimo> http://api.jquery.com/attr/ ?
[02:38:28] <interlocutor> anyone know of a good tutorial on using DataTables?
[02:44:12] <phrearch> hm this is weird. if i add or remove a class thats part of another delegate as well, it disables the other delegate's trigger
[02:44:28] <phrearch> only happens on the same click event
[02:45:11] <jinzo> hello, I'm using some of the jQ widgets on my site, and now I want to "overlay" one of them (for notification porpuses), I tried immense z-index fu, but nothing works
[02:45:18] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476373/
[02:45:25] <Wiz_KeeD> so can anyone tell me which one would have an html description?
[02:45:30] <jinzo> any ideas, how/what do I need to set to overlay a jq ui widget?
[02:50:04] <g0rd0n> i have an ajax loading icon that shows up, however if i open a mdoal jquery ui dialog the loading icon gets darkened like the rest of the page... what can i do so that the loading icon stays on top of the jquery ui dialog?
[02:53:22] <phrearch> g0rd0n: define the z-index in both the dialog and the icon
[02:53:32] <phrearch> there is a zindex option for dialog
[02:53:51] <phrearch> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-zIndex
[02:53:53] <g0rd0n> oh right, ok... fixed that. now this is not a jquery questino i guess but i was wondering how i can make it so that the icon shows in the middle of the page
[02:54:06] <g0rd0n> with a transparent background image
[02:54:10] <g0rd0n> just like the modal dialog does
[02:54:13] <phrearch> css positioning?
[02:54:21] <interlocutor> i'm trying to stay away from installing a full CMS, but I need a plugin that will allow a client to edit tables and some body text, but not allow regular visitors to
[02:54:23] <phrearch> position:absolute;
[02:54:32] <interlocutor> anyone know of a basic plugin like that?
[02:56:46] <interlocutor> anyone know of anything even remotely similar?
[02:57:32] <iszak> interlocutor, simplecms?
[02:57:46] <interlocutor> I see plugins for in place editing, but none that include any kind of permissions validation
[02:58:08] <interlocutor> I'm trying to stay way from any server side scripting
[02:58:32] <interlocutor> also, i think simplecms doesn't have a self hosted option anyway
[02:58:41] <phrearch> hm if there are two event handlers reacting to a click event on the same element. would it be possible to define the order in which they are executed?
[02:59:29] <johnline3> hey peopie, i have this code:
[02:59:29] <johnline3> $('.clientimage').cycle({speed:300,timeout:0,pager:'.clientlist',pagerEvent:'mouseover',before:output,pagerAnchorBuilder:function (idx,slide){return '.clientlist li:eq(' + (idx) + ') a';}});
[02:59:29] <johnline3> and i am removing the ul>li>a structure and having just ul>li
[02:59:46] <interlocutor> johnline3: please use a pastebin
[02:59:52] <johnline3> i am confused what to do with the idx bit
[03:06:13] <johnline3> lol, got finished creating a jsfiddle
[03:06:20] <johnline3> then fixed it myself :/\
[03:06:38] <johnline3> all i needed was to remove the 'a'
[03:16:47] <MofeMike> i have a question in calling a callback function
[03:17:10] <Hooloovoo> MofeMike: shoot
[03:17:12] <MofeMike> can somebody help me?

[03:20:23] <aleray> hi, i'm using jeditable and I have nested elements all binded to jeditable. Problem is when I click on a nested element the click event gets triggered on its parent. How can I avoid this ?
[03:26:57] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/TJ9Dt/ i need a help lol
[03:31:25] <fruitbat> need to add peristance yet but its on my list
[03:31:43] <left-blank> anybody know of a slider plugin which allows a slider to be at an angle as opposed to horizontal or vertical?
[03:34:33] <shomon> hi, I want to exclude quotes and double quotes from a form field. Is there a jquery that'll do that?
[03:34:59] <shomon> or let me only input the kind of thing that'll go in a name/surname field?
[03:39:10] <shomon> ok I've figured out I need "mask" but how to allow it to include hyphens and things?
[04:05:07] <MoTiOnXml> is jQuery Tools considered old?
[04:05:21] <MoTiOnXml> just wondering if the plugins work with latest jQuery / UI
[04:07:29] <red> was hard to join here heh, kept typing /j query
[04:07:30] <red> :D
[04:08:13] <red> anyhow, shouldn't this work (using noconflict) jQuery('#result').html('<p>test</p>'); (in realcase the <p> is data from AJAX which displays just fine when testing with alert())
[04:08:19] <inad922> hello
[04:08:46] <inad922> Can someone tell me what does '$(function() { ?. });' does in jquery?
[04:09:39] <red> inad922: I suppose the code ran inside is "private" and doesnt affect the global scope, but I might be wrong since I'm quite bad in JS :)
[04:12:05] <N0va`> red: That should work fine, is jQuery('#result') actually a valid object, thats the only thing I can think of, unless the data displayed from AJAX is incorrect, which you've said it isn't..
[04:15:09] <seutje> inad922: shortcut to doc rdy, assuming the "?." isn't actual code
[04:15:57] <inad922> seutje: nah ? is just placeholder. Thanks seutje
[04:16:59] <red> n0va`: yeah it should meh http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2188345/odd.png
[04:17:51] <red> the id of the div is #result20937 - console.log verifies that JS has the same id appended in there, but still trying to access it gives just []
[04:18:43] <azazul> hi
[04:18:51] <red> don't mind the extra dashesh in the pic, was just ctrl-z:ing
[04:19:36] <N0va`> red, your looking for '#result-$unique' and you said your div is #result20937, notice no -
[04:19:58] <N0va`> Also, I'm basically  using the exact same setup as you, ubuntu, geany :D
[04:20:25] <red> i just reinstalled so wrong scheme in geany, I prefer the twilight theme :)
[04:21:08] <N0va`> heh
[04:21:19] <red> but like I said, pay no heed to the dashesh, it doesn't work even when they match
[04:21:35] <red> just cleaned up some testing for screenie, but went too far
[04:21:55] <N0va`> lol
[04:22:38] <red> oh well, thanks for trying to help
[04:22:49] <N0va`> Did that not fix it?
[04:24:50] <red> nope
[04:25:18] <red> I think its something to do with appending the $unique to the element that confuses jQuery
[04:25:21] <red> gotta test a bit
[04:25:29] <N0va`> Really, hmm. Thats the only thing I can see causing it not to work, that the div id name is different to the one your searching. But yeah could be that too.
[04:26:40] <bryricker> Hey, can anybody take a quick look at this little JS and see why all the DIVS link to the first div's link location? http://jsfiddle.net/PFrWD/
[04:26:59] <red> n0va`: had hitl alt-space accidently
[04:27:07] <red> inspect hid it
[04:27:11] <N0va`> xD
[04:27:18] <red> but reading source directly showed #result12356&nbsp;
[04:27:21] <red> NO WONDER
[04:27:23] <N0va`> ahh
[04:27:37] <red> I hate that in geany, cant figure where to turn it off :D
[04:27:45] <red> space -> parenthesis (or bracket)
[04:27:52] <red> sometimes im too fast with alt-gr :D
[04:29:05] <bryricker> oh actually I got it, I see that the link wasn't referencing the clicked div
[04:41:15] <yan_nick> Hey guys, how can I load a specific element via ajax?
[04:41:37] <ahandy> can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/hZ8HU/ click ont he right image and then on the left and look how the div doesnt open
[04:41:51] <yan_nick> I don't want to use load, because i need my existing html code in the element.
[04:44:48] <seutje> yan_nick: an XMLHttpRequest doesn't load elements
[04:45:10] <yan_nick> seutje: And how can I filter out my specific element?
[04:45:24] <seutje> $('#element', data)
[04:45:44] <seutje> assuming ur using "data" as the name of the data argument passed to the success handler
[04:46:58] <yan_nick> seutje: .load or .get?
[04:48:39] <marlun> If I've got a <div> with a <a> inside it and I want that clicking the div should be the same as clicking the <a>, if I add a click event on the <div> and inside it get the <a> and trigger('click') would that bubble to the div and create a endless loop or would it just follow the link?
[04:49:30] <NoNoNo> marlun: Just try :)  in HTML5 it
[04:49:45] <NoNoNo> it's valid to <a><div></div></a>
[04:50:39] <Cork> NoNoNo: no i'm quite sure html5 don't make block objects in inline ones valid
[04:51:52] <NoNoNo> Cork: http://developers.whatwg.org/text-level-semantics.html
[04:52:13] <Cork> marlun: just use event.stopPropagation on the a tag
[04:52:21] <NoNoNo> quote: The a element may be wrapped around entire paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth, even entire sections, so long as there is no interactive content within (e.g. buttons or other links).
[04:52:41] <ahandy> can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/hZ8HU/ click ont he right image and then on the left and look how the div doesnt open
[04:52:58] <NoNoNo> marlun: Or skip the DIV and just A with CSS { display: block }
[04:53:28] <Cork> NoNoNo: there might be other things beside the a tag in the div
[04:54:11] <yan_nick> seutje: ?
[04:54:33] <seutje> yan_nick: heh "I don't want to use load"
[04:54:47] <NoNoNo> Cork: just include everything inside the DIV inside the A
[04:54:52] <yan_nick> seutje: so $.get yeah?
[04:55:21] <seutje> yan_nick: I was thinking the regular ajax method, but whatever shortcut method floats ur boat
[04:55:41] <yan_nick> seutje: ah okay
[04:55:47] <seutje> don't rly see how it would matter in the context of ur question
[04:56:40] <Cork> NoNoNo: i still haven't seen a single comment in your link saying you'r allowed to use block elements inside inline elements
[04:57:04] <Cork> NoNoNo: and adding all kind of things inside a links tend to cause problems
[04:57:08] <NoNoNo> Cork: "The a element may be wrapped around entire paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth, even entire sections"
[04:57:59] * Cork nods
[04:58:14] <Cork> new to me, and i would prob not use it, its not backwards compatible
[05:00:30] <NoNoNo> Cork: it is :) HTML5 just standardizes the long time bad habbits of web development...
[05:00:58] <Cork> NoNoNo: i know older browsers that will screw up if you put some of those contents in a a tag
[05:01:16] <NoNoNo> Cork: No, try it. Will work in NN4 or IE5
[05:01:57] <Gavrisimo> i think the only problem with a element being parent to block elements is that you will get css validation error which you can fix by making that a element a block element
[05:02:20] <Cork> Gavrisimo: no not css validation
[05:02:52] <NoNoNo> A > DIV is not valid in HTML4, only in HTML5
[05:02:52] <Cork> Gavrisimo: css doens't care about that
[05:04:48] <Gavrisimo> ah right, i spoke too soon(ie before i checked it because my memory on that issue is funky ;D )
[05:12:24] <gnarf> is it possible to detect the act of dragging and dropping a standard <a> tag on say a <div> ?
[05:17:21] <stede> i try to test a simple example of ui-tabs. but they dont work and i donno why :-/ i use jquery 1.6.2 and ui 1.8.16 -> http://pastebin.com/jk1T5fCW .. no errors in java console
[05:21:29] <seutje> stede: works fine, did u forget to add the css? http://jsfiddle.net/aSk3E/
[05:22:54] <birdpoop> Hi anyone have any experience with the jquery countdown plugin?
[05:29:05] <seutje> birdpoop: ambiguous questions like that are often left unanswered
[05:31:13] <peppux> hello
[05:31:22] <birdpoop> i know, so are detailed questions about a specific plugin:)
[05:31:24] <peppux> i have a question
[05:31:43] <peppux> when i call an ajax request, with firebug i see that the response is always 1
[05:31:45] <peppux> why=
[05:31:47] <peppux> ?
[05:42:43] <Haprog> Just found a new bug in jQuery .append() affecting IE6-8 when using HTML5 elements: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10283
[05:45:31] <nail_> Shouldn't that be .append(document.createTextNode("append")) if you want to append text?
[05:45:38] <g0rd0n> Haprog: you're holding it wrong
[05:46:03] <Haprog> g0rd0n: holding? what do you mean?
[05:46:15] <g0rd0n> Haprog: nothing, was a joke
[05:46:22] <Haprog> g0rd0n: lol :P
[05:46:45] <Haprog> nail_: well it doesn't matter if I append('test') or append('<p>stuff</p>') etc.
[05:46:55] <Haprog> still the same error
[05:47:25] <Haprog> append('plain text') seems to work just as expected in all other cases

[06:21:36] <boobyWomack> thx :)
[06:21:40] <johnline3> BOBBY WOMAN
[06:21:40] <jeffsmykil> that works
[06:21:42] <jeffsmykil> heh
[06:22:17] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[06:22:57] <boobyWomack> pachet - you mean like store the span textin a buffer?
[06:23:00] <boobyWomack> good idea.
[06:23:06] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: np, parseInt on .css("width") as suggested by pachet would also work
[06:23:07] <boobyWomack> no way to do it with a selector?
[06:28:37] <pachet> boobyWomack: nodeType isnt a builtin selector, no
[06:28:59] <pachet> you could write something to that effect i guess, but seems like unnecessary work
[06:29:26] <boobyWomack> ok, yeah got yrs working, good suggestion, ta!

[06:30:41] <enyovelcora> Hi there. I have a plugin that works on a set of form elements.
[06:31:10] <enyovelcora> So inside this plugin I store: myElements: [] , and when there is another form element to be added, I simply add the jquery object to that list.
[06:31:25] <enyovelcora> So now I have an array, containing jQuery objects
[06:31:41] <enyovelcora> But what if I now want to, say, add a class to all those objects
[06:32:05] <enyovelcora> I'd have to iterate over the array, and call .addClass() on every jQuery object separately
[06:32:30] <enyovelcora> Is there a way to convert an array of jQuery objects into a single jQuery object, containing all the elements?
[06:32:47] <enyovelcora> Or should I store an additional jQuery object, containing ALL my elements?
[06:33:06] <Lion31> imagine a tabber with 3 tabs... I have a webpage wrapper with 3 main div panels, that are loaded trough ajax... and they are all different sizes... I use a marginLeft animation to slide the panels between.... the problem is, that when I load the tallest... all other have then that height...except of their own (auto)...unless I remove the content from other panesl... but I don't want to do
[06:33:06] <Lion31> that.... so what am I to do?
[06:33:17] <kinga> i know this not a jquery related question, but it's JS and AJAX related
[06:33:42] <kinga> what will 'response' from success: function(response) be if the script doesn't echo anything ?
[06:33:50] <kinga> will response be undefined? or "" ?
[06:34:27] <seutje> an empty string would be my guess
[06:34:38] <seutje> if u used text as data format
[06:35:16] <kinga> it's json :-s
[06:35:27] <kinga> i hope it won't be a parse error
[06:37:11] <glauco29> hi there
[06:37:32] <enyovelcora> kinga: If the server really does not return anything, it probably will result in a parse error
[06:37:54] <kborchers> kinga: why not just have the server return {} if there is nothing to return?
[06:38:08] <glauco29> I would like to get image dimensions (wid x heigh) using .width() and .height() within $(function()){});
[06:38:12] <enyovelcora> kinga: better, let it return null
[06:38:14] <quicksilver> jQuery.parseJSON handles the empty string specifically, kborchers, kinga
[06:38:17] <kinga> ah ok, you're right :) i'll make it echo "{}"
[06:38:26] <quicksilver> "Additionally if you pass in nothing, an empty string, null, or undefined, 'null' will be returned from parseJSON"
[06:38:32] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[06:38:33] <jeffsmykil> there is no default mousewheel up mousewheel down?
[06:38:39] <glauco29> I need verify if the image is loaded, anyone can help me?
[06:39:06] <kinga> can i echo null ?
[06:39:12] <glauco29> I have tried $('#imgselector').load(function(){}); but dont work
[06:39:18] <enyovelcora> kinga: yes.. null is valid JSON
[06:39:28] <glauco29> anyone can helpme?
[06:39:31] <kinga> ok, thanks a bunch :)
[06:39:46] <enyovelcora> kinga: The fact that jQuery interprets an empty string as null is not common behavior.
[06:39:55] <enyovelcora> kinga: and you shouldn't rely upon
[06:40:12] <kinga> i'm using echo null; in php
[06:40:39] <kinga> and how will response look like ? will it be null as well ?
[06:40:46] <enyovelcora> kinga: yes
[06:40:58] <glauco29> enyovelcora:
[06:41:03] <glauco29> can u help me?
[06:41:21] <enyovelcora> glauco29: sorry.. I would just google it. I'm sure you'll find lots of info there
[06:41:38] <dropMAU5> anyone ever use that bubbletip plugin? http://code.google.com/p/bubbletip/
[06:41:42] <enyovelcora> kinga: $.parseJSON("") === $.parseJSON("null")
[06:41:50] <enyovelcora> === null
[06:42:03] <glauco29> ok
[06:42:06] <glauco29> thank u
[06:42:09] <kinga> oh wait
[06:42:20] <kinga> you mean the string "null" or the object null ? in php
[06:42:35] <enyovelcora> Wellâ€¦ depends on how you print
[06:42:39] <tarzeau> dropMAU5: i don't like them
[06:42:47] <tarzeau> dropMAU5: why? how do they work with touch screens?
[06:42:52] <enyovelcora> The resulting text should be: null, NOT "null" (of course.. that would be the string null)
[06:42:58] <kinga> i stated that i'm doing like so: echo null;
[06:43:00] <enyovelcora> So: echo 'null'; is fine
[06:43:12] <enyovelcora> echo null; will result in an empty page
[06:43:17] <enyovelcora> sorry.. hadn't read that
[06:43:19] <kinga> gud :) thanks
[06:43:26] <dropMAU5> they wouldn't work with touch screens. luckily our software isn't really compadable with mobile devices anyway, not that only mobile have touch screens
[06:44:30] <sadmicrowave> hi all, how can I change the height and width of the browser window?
[06:45:04] <kborchers> sup sadistwasher ;)
[06:45:13] <sadmicrowave> yo kboardshorts
[06:45:19] <kborchers> heh
[06:45:25] <sadmicrowave> got some answers?
[06:45:37] <sadmicrowave> **long time no see**
[06:45:43] <sadmicrowave> err - talk
[06:45:46] <kborchers> hmm, never done it other than when opening a new window
[06:45:47] <sadmicrowave> err - type..
[06:46:45] <chilversc_> how do I display a datepicker without attaching it to an input?
[06:47:03] <kborchers> yeah, been around during the day but less at night
[06:47:13] <Elephant> Anyone know if fancybox-inner is a div no longer used by the plugin?
[06:47:35] <Elephant> the div with the overflow style had no ID, so I can't select it for .scrollTop() usage.
[06:47:49] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, got it - window.outerWidth = [pixels] and .outerHeight (not jQuery, but I like to use javascript where applicable anyways)
[06:47:50] <Elephant> it's a child of div id="fancybox-content" though.
[06:48:40] <arpegius> any thoughts why this getJSON callback isn't firing: https://gist.github.com/1219264 ? I validated the json string and it is validâ€¦
[06:48:46] <kborchers> chilversc_: just apply the date picker to a div $('#datepicker').datepicker(); where #datepicker is a div id
[06:48:53] <ksinkar> hi guys I am working on jquery treeview and am not getting the expected result. Can you please have a look at the code and point out the error to me. http://pastebin.com/rruATJts
[06:49:19] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: yeah, definitely no need for jQuery there
[06:49:33] <sadmicrowave> pretty simple
[06:50:17] <chilversc_> kborchers: that displays it inline though rather than as a pop-up
[06:50:34] <chilversc_> I want the date picker to show as a popup in response to the user clicking on a span
[06:50:39] <kinga> i have a javascript question: if i append a html code, an input elem which has onclick=Something(); will the function be attached to click event ?
[06:50:42] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: you seen nascro around at all? someone a few days ago was asking about map stuff that seemed similar to that map he had done and you worked on as well and neither of you were online but i haven't seen him in ages
[06:50:53] <ccmonster> hey kborchers , you got experience with google analytics?
[06:51:01] <kinga> what i'm trying to do is get html code from a php script through jquery/ajax
[06:51:18] <kborchers> ccmonster: sure but is this a jQuery question? ;)
[06:52:22] <ccmonster> Not as in a jquery plugin, or adapter. More about getting the asynch set up in this app that is all jquery.
[06:52:28] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, I haven't been on in about a month, so...no, I haven't seen him. If you see the guy asking about map stuff again, here is what nascro and I were working on: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/7CYAc/
[06:52:40] <sadmicrowave> ^save it
[06:52:44] <chilversc_> effectivly I want the datepicker to be more "dumb", as in don't try and update a field, don't work out the date for itself, I'll tell it the date, and let me know when the user has picked a date
[06:52:51] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: cool, thanks
[06:52:59] <sadmicrowave> fo sho
[06:54:32] <kborchers> ?ui.datepicker @ chilversc_
[06:54:32] <bot-t> chilversc_, The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[06:54:33] <ccmonster> Very slick sadmicrowave
[06:56:14] <chilversc_> kborchers: I can't find anything there that lets me control how and where its displayed though
[06:57:12] <ccmonster> just tap into the Events chilversc_ .
[06:57:41] <chilversc_> ccmonster: but my problem is, I can't tell it to display as a pop-up when attached to a span
[06:58:04] <ccmonster> popup? as a dialog?
[06:58:13] <chilversc_> yeah, same as it would if attached to an input
[06:58:57] <ccmonster> Why not? Just modify the showOn
[06:59:11] <ccmonster> and attach it to a span
[06:59:55] <ccmonster> and do you HAVE to attach it to a span?
[07:00:47] <kinga> numbers sent via POST/GET are ints or strings in php ?
[07:01:03] <pachet> var a=$(this).offset().top; var b=$(this).offset().left;
[07:01:10] <pachet> asdf
[07:01:16] <pachet> wrong window ;(
[07:01:19] <chilversc_> ccmonster: the idea is I have a header saying "Day: Tues, 24th July 2011" and I want to show the picker when the date is clicked
[07:01:46] <flint0131> kinga; try var_dump()ing it
[07:01:46] <g0rd0n> kinga: dunno, try something like $_REQUEST['id'] === (int) $_REQUEST['id']
[07:02:07] <kinga> sorry for the php/javascript question, but since i'm still here might as well go ahead and ask
[07:02:53] <NoCarrier> http://jsbin.com/asasac/edit#javascript,html,live    why does he call the helper function $.getUID?  Isn't it a not-good practice to clutter up $.?
[07:02:58] <dropMAU5> what's the reverse of appendTo?
[07:03:23] <nVee> sup guys. I have been assigned a role to create a jquery script which should allow someone to pick a order of preference for 3 videos (1, 2 or 3). Has anyone create a script like this before? In essence if I click on 1 on video 2, 1 may not be an option for video 1 and 3 (if that makes sense?)
[07:03:30] <kborchers> dropMAU5: reverse meaning remove() or reverse meaning prependTo() ?
[07:03:32] <nVee> I figured doing it with 3 radio buttons per video
[07:05:11] <BillCriswell> Doing a "mobile" cart page is a pain in the ass.
[07:05:20] <dropMAU5> sorry, I didn't ask that well. I'd like something like addThis
[07:06:05] <BillCriswell> dropdrive: prependTo() ?
[07:06:11] <kborchers> ?append @ dropMAU5
[07:06:12] <bot-t> dropMAU5, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[07:06:21] <BillCriswell> dropMAU5: prependTo() ? *
[07:06:22] <sadmicrowave> ccmonster, thanks
[07:06:27] <dropMAU5> duh! thanks ;)
[07:06:42] <dropMAU5> no, just append... thanks again
[07:06:55] <BillCriswell> It sucks that append is a word and prepend isn't.
[07:07:23] <kborchers> BillCriswell: what do you mean?
[07:08:17] <BillCriswell> kborchers: the last time I looked it up prepend wasn't in the dictionary... I must have been doing it wrong cause I just checked and it's there now lol.
[07:08:49] <kborchers> ahh, i see
[07:09:01] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/VDz4J/5/  <- how can I make #webpage's height to adapt to current .page_content  height?
[07:09:05] <BillCriswell> Oh, it's considered "Computing Jargon"
[07:09:41] <seldon75> hi, I'm trying to determine whether my element is hidden by using: if( jQuery('#navigation').filter(':hidden') )
[07:09:59] <seldon75> but this returns true even when #navigation isnt hidden
[07:10:09] <seldon75> i cant see why it's returning true
[07:10:10] <seldon75> or it's ancestors
[07:10:11] <BillCriswell> seldon75: You can use like... .is(':hidden') ?
[07:10:17] <seldon75> ok ill try that
[07:10:42] <seldon75> ah, that works
[07:10:43] <seldon75> thanks!
[07:10:44] <NoCarrier> http://jsbin.com/asasac/edit#javascript,html,live    why does he call the helper function $.getUID?  Isn't it a not-good practice to clutter up $.?
[07:10:50] <BillCriswell> seldon75: No problem.
[07:12:00] <chilversc_> here's the sort of UI I'm trying to get http://jsfiddle.net/74Gn7/1/
[07:12:14] <chilversc_> the only question really, is how to handle the datepicker correctly
[07:15:06] <Lion31> any1?
[07:15:44] <anfernee> any2?
[07:15:44] <pangel> What is the best/fastest way to transform a (DOMElement or jQuery object) into a (jQuery object)?
[07:16:36] <muzone_> best custom scrollbar plugin anyway?
[07:18:42] <BillCriswell> pangel: $() ?
[07:20:27] <pangel> BillCriswell: so it's a no-op if the object is already a jQuery object?
[07:26:59] <nVee> sup guys. I have been assigned a role to create a jquery script which should allow someone to pick a order of preference for 3 videos (1, 2 or 3). Has anyone create a script like this before? In essence if I click on 1 on video 2, 1 may not be an option for video 1 and 3 (if that makes sense?)
[07:27:03] <nVee> I figured doing it with 3 radio buttons per video
[07:30:56] <ccmonster> make it simpler nVee.
[07:31:14] <ccmonster> just have them click in order of the order they want, they display the order number when they click.
[07:31:21] <ccmonster> then*
[07:31:55] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: what happened with that previous form guy?
[07:31:59] <ccmonster> or something where they click something the number of times to represent the order perhaps
[07:33:48] <Anticom> hi all
[07:34:02] <Anticom> is it possible to scroll the browser window without using html or body selector?
[07:34:09] <Anticom> dunno what to select :/
[07:34:10] <ccmonster> hey kborchers , so I put the regular _gaq google analytics piece in the <head> , then in my script, which is loaded at the end of the <body> , i just want to do a _gaq.push...., as far as I understand. But I get a _gaq is unidentified. Yet, in my document.ready if i console.log(_gaq) i can see it.
[07:34:19] <ccmonster> I assume it's scope, but it sort of escapes me in this case.
[07:34:38] <ccmonster> you want to make the window scroll?
[07:35:08] <ccmonster> autoscroll perhaps?
[07:35:49] <Lion31> any ideas for my problem? :(
[07:35:57] <Anticom> yeah... i'm flushing with php but it's only some kind of debug live log
[07:35:59] <ccmonster> whats your issue Lion31 ?
[07:36:36] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/VDz4J/5/  <- how can I make #webpage's height to adapt to current .page_content  height?
[07:36:38] <Anticom> and now i want jq to scroll to the bottom of the page everytime an interval fires
[07:37:01] <ccmonster> #webpage.outerHeight = .page.content.outerHeight
[07:37:03] <ccmonster> or something
[07:37:06] <ccmonster> i havent looked at the demo yet
[07:37:14] <Lion31> better yet... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7432555/jquery-slider-how-to-auto-height
[07:38:18] <Anticom> ccmonster autoscroll would just improve how the page was scrolled, but that unfortunately doesn't solve my problem of what to select
[07:38:23] <itsmeoverhere> Hiya all,
[07:38:32] <Anticom> hi itsmeoverhere
[07:39:00] <kborchers> ccmonster: not sure. haven't done that much with GA
[07:40:00] <itsmeoverhere> I want to reposition an draggable using script (working on a save/restore postion), saving the postion works OK, if I set it after creation with $("#id").css({left:x,top:y}) it works.
[07:40:18] <ccmonster> well, can I show you a basic pastie of my situation.
[07:40:24] <itsmeoverhere> however, if I do this in the create event, it doen nothing..
[07:40:30] <ccmonster> From the async docs ive read, it SHOULD be pretty straight forward
[07:40:38] <kborchers> ccmonster: sure
[07:41:00] <ccmonster> Thanks kborchers . Need a fresh (and probably better) set of eyes .

[07:42:52] <ccmonster> I dont doubt that pachet  :)
[07:44:00] <ccmonster> Lion, so what am I looking for? What is wrong? What is your intention?
[07:44:11] <ccmonster> sorry, im between a few things, so if you break it down I can just peek at it and see.
[07:44:20] <kborchers> itsmeoverhere: must be something else you've done. this works fine http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/RJ8Gn/
[07:44:40] <Lion31> http://jsfiddle.net/VDz4J/13/ ... DID it
[07:45:21] <davock> is there any room about mobile web dev?
[07:45:37] <Lion31> just to be neat, how do I animate to outerheight?

[07:46:04] <pachet> lol
[07:46:22] <ccmonster> lol.
[07:46:57] <Elephant> anyone see issues with .postion() in chrome?
[07:46:57] <itsmeoverhere> kborchers, thanks, back to code to seek out the difference, at least now I know it should work ;!
[07:47:05] <kborchers> np
[07:47:38] <kborchers> Elephant: what are you seeing? see ?demo
[07:47:38] <bot-t> Elephant, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:47:58] <Elephant> k
[07:48:06] <Elephant> I'm in the google phase right now.
[07:48:15] <Elephant> I'll be sure to follow up if I think it's abug.
[07:52:26] <muzone_> what plugin yall recommend for custom scrollbars?
[07:52:55] <johnline3> i think i've tried them all
[07:52:55] <wib> The 90's called and wanted their custom scrollbars back.
[07:53:04] <Elephant> ^
[07:53:07] <Elephant> <3 jquery
[07:53:18] <johnline3> they all carry pros and cons, i wanted something lightwieght, but also sleek
[07:53:20] <Elephant> I say I hate it, but it's a lie.
[07:53:34] <muzone_> indeed johnline3
[07:53:39] <muzone_> im looking for the exact same thing
[07:53:42] <muzone_> what did you end up with?
[07:53:46] <johnline3> the one im using atm is jScrollbar
[07:53:47] <smftre> I'm trying to use tablesorter.com's jquery tablesort and am loading in data from ajax request into my table, I then .trigger("update") and then apply .tablesorter(). anyone used this type of thing before?
[07:54:35] <muzone_> johnline3: have you tried this? http://baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/
[07:54:47] * muzone_ cant find jscrollbar at http://www.net-kit.com/jquery-custom-scrollbar-plugins/
[07:54:54] <johnline3> it needs jqueryui and jquery mousewheel to function, which is a drawback, but i just made a stripped library of jqueryui to keep it light
[07:55:07] <johnline3> as far as the html implementation, its clean enough
[07:56:05] <johnline3> i have used that one too, switched away from it cause i wanted something a little more flashy
[07:56:19] <johnline3> but its a top 5
[07:56:33] <muzone_> johnline3: flashy how?
[07:56:53] <johnline3> http://www.myjqueryplugins.com/jScrollbar
[07:56:58] <johnline3> this one
[07:57:21] <johnline3> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/profile/
[07:57:26] <johnline3> here it is on my site
[07:57:41] <johnline3> it slides nice and fast and has bounce fx
[07:58:07] <ccmonster> Alright kborchers , http://pastie.org/2537639 , line 6 in the JS section shows me exactly what I expect, line 80-1, gives me an error. Wasn't sure if i was doing something wrong, or not creating the tracker right, or soemething.
[07:58:15] <ccmonster> Thanks ahead of time.
[08:00:30] <kborchers> ccmonster: a little off topic but did you figure out the page.State thing?
[08:00:42] <ccmonster> yea. I had to REALLY strip it down.
[08:01:20] <ccmonster> basically I set eff holding the state, and just kept referencing the History.getState(), which works and I'm ok with, but doesn't 'feel' as right as doing the page.State approach.
[08:01:36] <ccmonster> i said*
[08:01:55] <muzone_> johnline3: wow
[08:02:07] <muzone_> johnline3: that is hands down the best design ive ever seen anybody front on irc
[08:02:18] <kborchers> gotcha, yeah i guess that works. still hurts my brain trying to figure out why it didn't work the other way since it really looked like it should
[08:02:22] <johnline3> :o thanks
[08:02:33] <johnline3> i am new to web design
[08:02:41] <crab> hi. is there some way i can make an http request from jquery and measure the download speed?
[08:02:42] <muzone_> you designed this?
[08:02:49] <ccmonster> I like it. very clean.
[08:03:03] <johnline3> yeah, first in adobe illustrator, then learned css
[08:03:04] <muzone_> ccmonster: hell yeah!!
[08:03:09] <pachet> crab: firebug
[08:03:15] <crab> johnline3: what's the url? i'd like to see this nice design too.
[08:03:22] <muzone_> johnline3: congrats
[08:03:27] <johnline3> ty
[08:03:36] <muzone_> anyway what you mean flashy scrollbar though?
[08:03:39] <johnline3> still got validation errors to fix
[08:03:47] <ccmonster> yea kborchers , me too. It was KILLINg my brain off and on for two days.
[08:04:18] <crab> pachet: no, i mean, write js code to measure and display the speed.
[08:04:18] <johnline3> when you overscroll the content, the sliding bar bounces back into position
[08:04:18] <ccmonster> I had to step away from it at times and focus on anything that wasn't that for a while.
[08:04:51] <ccmonster> I need to refactor that code eventually.
[08:04:57] <muzone_> johnline3: thats it?
[08:04:57] <crab> i just want to know if it's possible or not. if it's not, fine.
[08:05:08] <muzone_> crab: http://www.exhibitiondesign.com
[08:05:10] <ccmonster> clean it up. use shorter param names, turn it into a revealing module pattern perhaps.
[08:06:00] <red> doesn't .prev('input') target the previous input element found in DOM?
[08:06:08] <red> getting [] for some reason when trying to console.log it
[08:06:46] <ccmonster> red, demo?
[08:06:47] <enyovelcora> Is there some way to use jquery's  grep() function, so that it returns only the first result it found?!
[08:06:49] <ccmonster> fiddle? pastie?
[08:06:57] <johnline3> yeah thats really the only difference, and tinyscrollbar is a little bit messier to implement into the html
[08:07:02] <ccmonster> grep().eq(0)? or eq(1)?
[08:07:10] <ccmonster> im not sure if eq works on that
[08:07:23] <ccmonster> i always forget what eq does and doesn't work for.
[08:07:24] <kborchers> ccmonster: so i'm guessing it is a scope thing, though seems odd. not really sure but i might try defining a function outside of page that does your pushes and pass your path into that and see if it can reference _gaq. mostly just a guess though :/
[08:07:36] <enyovelcora> ccmonster: This seems like a huge waste of resources since it has to invoke the iterator for every remaining item
[08:07:53] <muzone_> johnline3: so prior to your need for this little bounceback thingie you used tinyscrollbar?
[08:08:01] <ccmonster> what are you referring to enyovelcora ?
[08:08:05] <muzone_> im trying to avoid jquery ui and all that, if possible..
[08:08:08] <ccmonster> Yea, I assume it's scope
[08:08:25] <ccmonster> kborchers, how do I see what is actually being pushed?
[08:08:44] <ccmonster> I dont see any troubleshooting, easy ways to debug (maybe im just being blind, which is possible)
[08:09:03] <kborchers> ccmonster: you mean what's inside of _gaq?
[08:09:04] <enyovelcora> ccmonster: well, let's say I have an array of 100 elements. And I simply want to find the first item for which my iterator returns true. With grep(), the iterator will be applied to all 100 elements, even if the first element already returned true
[08:09:27] <muzone_> johnline3: my goal is something like the http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/newin/items.aspx?oby=4 sidebar
[08:09:29] <johnline3> yeah muzone_, cause it didnt need the extra js libraries, just jquery.js
[08:09:30] <ccmonster> or what I last pushed
[08:09:37] <ccmonster> like, i dont know if a push is successful or not
[08:09:45] <ccmonster> there is no handshake, or response that i see
[08:09:54] <ccmonster> im likely being dense, but hopefully that makes sense.
[08:09:58] <red> ccmonster: too complex to put into jsfiddle
[08:10:07] <red> deep deep in a script this part :)
[08:10:13] <red> full of dynamic stuff
[08:10:17] <ccmonster> red, just a basic of your html structure you are referring to is all we need
[08:10:20] <johnline3> nice, you can style tinyscrollbar to look like that quite nicely
[08:10:30] <red> ccmonster: would take 15-20 min to do it
[08:10:33] <johnline3> plus on their site mousehweel doesnt work, but yours will
[08:10:33] <kborchers> if you console.log(_gaq); it should show you the contents. it's just an array
[08:10:34] <red> just asking if I'm trying wrong
[08:10:52] <ccmonster> um, then that is probably why .prev(input) doesnt work, if it's really that crazy
[08:11:05] <red> kay, ill try something with find instead then
[08:11:27] <jaequery> does javascript have some kind of native method that do this,   var full_name = join(' ', ['james', 'mcfly']);    ?
[08:11:52] <ccmonster> find, filter, slice, prev(), siblings
[08:11:57] <kborchers> ccmonster: getting more coffee, brb
[08:12:07] <ccmonster> all quite possible to work, since i dont really see your situation
[08:12:36] <ccmonster> yea, but if i log that out after each push, are you saying it should show the updated, last piece?
[08:12:40] <johnline3> oh also muzone_, check out flexcroll
[08:13:01] <johnline3> its very light, i think i remember the implementation is even cleaner
[08:14:29] <feathersanddown> Can $.post( ) send post to a page and then return an excel file ???
[08:14:39] <red> ccmonster: jQuery("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parent().parent().parent().find('input:first')
[08:14:46] <red> did the trick, feels dirty tho
[08:15:03] <N0va`> looks dirty :P
[08:15:05] <ccmonster> return an excel file? sure.....but via js? probably not
[08:15:25] <ccmonster> so #razuna.... is nested 3 elements deep?
[08:15:30] <danzik17> enyovelcora: http://jsfiddle.net/H4JLg/
[08:16:29] <ccmonster> red, try $("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parents() see what logs out
[08:16:54] <red> I can't pick the first input that is found from the first parent though, there are 2 before the one I need :)
[08:17:02] <red> but ill check docs on parents()
[08:17:03] <red> ty
[08:18:04] <ccmonster> it should show ALL the parents, so if you know the ID or something that helps distinguish the parent you want, you can do $("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parents().eq(3) or something, or perhaps $("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parents('div.class').siblings('input:first') or something
[08:19:09] <red> ahh
[08:20:08] <muzone_> johnline3: awesome man
[08:20:14] <muzone_> thanks a lot for the help
[08:20:17] <muzone_> and the inspiration
[08:20:30] <smftre> anyone used tablesort?
[08:21:48] <muzone_> johnline3: flexcroll's website looks kinda retarded: http://www.hesido.com/web.php?page=customscrollbar
[08:22:33] <kborchers> ccmonster: back
[08:22:43] <smftre> anybody?
[08:22:48] <kborchers> if you log it, your latest push should be at the end of the array
[08:24:26] <chot> hi
[08:25:16] <muzone_> johnline3: i mean, i usually judge the book by the cover
[08:25:17] <pheredhel> is there a page or something that lists problems with jquery and ie7? / what doesn'T work in ie7 ?
[08:25:19] <muzone_> maybe thats wrong though
[08:25:55] <muzone_> im just thinking, if the author allows his website to look like that, he's probably gonna allow some pretty retarded code
[08:25:59] <muzone_> no disrespect to the author though
[08:26:27] <chot> I'm coding on a ajax web app with a json server back-end, where the server is on another domain than the app (the server should be accessible from more than this app). it all works fine except one thing; session cookies aren't sent with the requests. I've read about jsonp and I'm wondering; is there an alternative that doesn't require me to wrap all responses on the server in a function call?
[08:26:54] <chot> I looked at the facebook graph api and it just gives back pure json
[08:27:06] <ccmonster> cool. ok, let me check that out. i will do some dummy pushes in the doc.ready and see what i get
[08:28:32] <ccmonster> kborchers, that didnt seem to work. hmm
[08:28:35] <pheredhel> chot: the problem is: no browser should send cookies to another domain/port/protocol tripple than the ones explicitly set in the cookie
[08:28:37] <chot> I tried doing this in the ajax request too; headers : { "Set-Cookie" : "PHPSESSID=" + $.cookie("PHPSESSID") + "; path=/" }, but it just broke the ajax request for some reason
[08:28:55] <red> ccmonster: jQuery("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parents().eq(2).children().eq(0).children('input')
[08:28:57] <pheredhel> chot: it's called same origin policy... so you have to include that data manually if you want to send it
[08:28:59] <jaequery> anyone here used angularjs?
[08:29:02] <jaequery> or use it?
[08:29:04] <ccmonster> that do the trick red?
[08:29:10] <red> ccmonster: that does not look too good either, figure there could still be a cleaner way :)
[08:29:16] <ccmonster> yes.
[08:29:19] <red> it's still better than the parent.parent?
[08:29:26] <chot> pheredhel: alright, so basically request.php?session=13535
[08:29:41] <chot> (or in POST I guess)
[08:29:45] <ccmonster> so what is the first child? what element is that? and does it stay the same (div? or same class?)
[08:29:47] <pheredhel> that would transfer the info, yes
[08:30:10] <kborchers> red: can you paste the html somewhere and what exactly you're trying to select?
[08:30:15] <ccmonster> basically, what is the child input contained in?
[08:30:34] <chot> pheredhel: ok thanx
[08:31:00] <kborchers> ccmonster: not sure man ... another fun one ;)
[08:31:10] <ccmonster> because im thinking something along the lines of ... $("#razuna-image-search-string-$unique").parents().eq(2).children('div:first-child input')
[08:31:19] <ccmonster> Im having a string of fun ones. my luck
[08:31:32] <rohan> i need help..
[08:31:42] <rohan> i m new to jquery..
[08:31:53] <pheredhel> what would I have to check for, to see if .addClass() works in a browser (IE7 doesn'T seem to like that)
[08:32:10] <ccmonster> hasClass?
[08:32:21] <rohan> <script type="text/javascript"> 	$(document).ready(function(){ 		$("#myform").validate({ 			debug: false, 			submitHandler: function(form) { 				$.post('sendmail.php', $("#myform").serialize(), function(data) { 					$('#results').html(data); 				}); 			} 		}); 	}); 					 	</script>
[08:32:26] <ccmonster> or just look at the element and see if the class is on the element post addClass

[08:41:47] <asher^> hi guys. is there some way i can do the equivalent of setting with .html on multiple divs at once?
[08:42:43] <danzik17> asher^: You could just do $('div').each(function() { $(this).html('foo'); })
[08:43:31] <asher^> oh cool (<-jquery noob)
[08:43:44] <rohan> my question,to rephrase it..
[08:43:50] <asher^> what would the syntax for selecting all divs with a particular class be in that instance?
[08:43:57] <asher^> 'div.classname'?
[08:43:59] <aaronmcadam> a selector
[08:44:03] <aaronmcadam> yea
[08:44:11] <asher^> sweet
[08:44:16] <aaronmcadam> sure is
[08:44:25] <rohan> is that my script doesnt send data to the php that inputs data to my mysql database..

[08:56:47] <Snooops> ah ok its runs
[08:56:55] <jwpeddle> wonder why that never came up in googling. Reading not.
[08:56:57] <jwpeddle> now
[08:57:59] <rohan> what good will fork do?
[08:58:25] <rohan> my problem is with the sendmail.php
[08:58:30] <rohan> ie
[08:58:48] <rohan> i think the data is never sent to the sendmail script.
[08:59:14] <rohan> @aaronmcadam what could be the error?>
[08:59:17] <rohan> ??
[08:59:52] <aaronmcadam> ?doesnt work @ rohan
[08:59:52] <bot-t> rohan, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:59:55] <Altreus> When using .slideDown() and .slideUp() on multiple elements at once like $('#thing_one, #thing_two').slideUp(), only one of the two elements actually gets the animation. Is it sensible simply to call it on each item separately?
[09:00:07] <rohan> okay..
[09:00:12] <rohan> the form shows.
[09:00:20] <rohan> form id="myform"
[09:00:30] <rohan> everything is fine.
[09:00:37] <aaronmcadam> your php is wrong then
[09:00:49] <rohan> cant be.
[09:00:53] <aaronmcadam> well check firebug
[09:00:56] <aaronmcadam> read this site

[09:01:01] <rohan> when i do form action=sendmail.php
[09:01:07] <rohan> it updates database
[09:01:08] <aaronmcadam> try and help yourself before u ask here
[09:01:14] <Altreus> hmm even if I call them separately it only does it for one of the two!
[09:01:17] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here use ezpz hinter for text inputs ?
[09:01:27] <FunnyLookinHat> Having trouble insert data for default values and making the suggestions go away.

[09:01:52] <aaronmcadam> Altreus: slide methods musn't work with a set of elements
[09:02:05] <aaronmcadam> read that site rohan on how to debug
[09:02:05] <rohan> dint go a long way.
[09:02:34] <Altreus> aaronmcadam: Not even if each element has a separate slide?
[09:02:42] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[09:02:57] <aaronmcadam> you'd have to probably do $(this).each
[09:03:09] <Altreus> $('#thing_one').slideDown(); $('#thing_two').slideDown();  exhibits the same behaviour
[09:03:39] <aaronmcadam> u sure ur animating the write parent
[09:03:42] <aaronmcadam> right*
[09:03:45] <Altreus> Two slide animations run fine as long as they are opposite; so I can use slideDown and slideUp at the same time
[09:03:57] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ Altreus
[09:03:58] <bot-t> Altreus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:04:00] <Altreus> Well yes, you see #thing_two disappears, it just doesn't slide
[09:04:14] <aaronmcadam> could be css
[09:04:14] <Altreus> will try and reproduce :)
[09:04:17] <aaronmcadam> fiddle it
[09:04:18] <Altreus> oh
[09:04:23] <Altreus> Actually there is a lot of CSS
[09:04:30] <aaronmcadam> abs positioning on the children?
[09:04:39] <rohan> read that site rohan on how to debug
[09:04:41] <Altreus> no
[09:04:47] <aaronmcadam> kk
[09:04:47] <rohan> did u see the script?
[09:05:01] <pachet> rohan: just test your jq without the table first. $.post("sendmail.php", { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" } ); or similar
[09:05:22] <jeffsmykil> does position() only update on page load?
[09:05:43] <rohan> <pachet> what good will that do?
[09:05:51] <Altreus> Typical of this company to be using 1.5.1
[09:05:57] <Altreus> The shortest-lived release ever
[09:06:04] <jeffsmykil> Altreus:  we use 1.4.1 lol
[09:06:07] <Altreus> i'll upgrade that
[09:06:14] <Altreus> :P
[09:06:50] <jeffsmykil> does position() only get updated on page load?
[09:06:53] <jaequery>  if i do var self = this;  is it creating a copy or a link?
[09:06:54] <pachet> rohan: it'll tell you whether your jq + php, in which case your problem is somewhere else
[09:06:58] <pachet> debugging 101
[09:07:00] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: no
[09:07:12] <pachet> *jq+php are working
[09:07:26] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: does position() include the margin?
[09:07:51] <Altreus> fiddlesticks
[09:07:57] <Altreus> It works in the jsfiddle
[09:08:03] <Altreus> That means it's probably the CSS here
[09:08:13] <aaronmcadam> cool
[09:08:16] <Altreus> aaronmcadam: ta - I forgot about fiddle
[09:08:20] <aaronmcadam> add in the css
[09:08:21] <Altreus> Gives me something to work with
[09:08:23] <aaronmcadam> bit by bit Alexer
[09:08:27] <aaronmcadam> Altreus:
[09:08:42] <aaronmcadam> add it in bit by bit until it stops working
[09:08:47] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: don't think so
[09:09:05] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: that might be the issue then thanks
[09:10:15] <Altreus> bah I can't make it not work!
[09:10:27] <aaronmcadam> lol
[09:10:29] <Altreus> I might just wrap them both in a single parent :)
[09:10:31] <Ankabout> can anyone help me with this?
[09:10:33] <Altreus> easier that way
[09:10:33] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/qZZYY/
[09:10:45] <aaronmcadam> you could make it work
[09:11:04] <aaronmcadam> must be something higher up Altreus, some selector's specificity
[09:11:06] <Ankabout> I want to make it so if you click a <li> the corresponding <p> becomes visible
[09:11:14] <aaronmcadam> use firebug to turn off style rules progressively
[09:11:29] <rohan> <pachet>  i did the foo thing
[09:11:42] <rohan> doesnt return anything.
[09:11:56] <pachet> use the values needed to fire your php script
[09:11:59] <rohan> other than the page itself.
[09:12:04] <pachet> i just used those as an example
[09:12:12] <kborchers> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/qZZYY/1/
[09:12:24] <Altreus> aaronmcadam: I found it!
[09:12:29] <Altreus> The stupid thing had min-height on it
[09:12:32] <rohan> my php is fine..
[09:12:32] <Altreus> who uses min-height?!
[09:12:34] <aaronmcadam> Altreus++
[09:12:39] <aaronmcadam> most things
[09:12:41] <Ankabout> kborchers, ah cool...
[09:12:44] <aaronmcadam> common
[09:12:54] <Ankabout> so index counts which # element it is within the parent?
[09:12:54] <rohan> it worked.
[09:12:58] <Altreus> yeah but not for things whose height isn't important
[09:13:01] <kborchers> Ankabout: yes
[09:13:08] <Ankabout> haha awesome
[09:13:10] <Ankabout> thanks!
[09:13:16] * Ankabout loves learning new stuff
[09:13:20] <rohan> i did the form action
[09:13:29] <rohan> it worked.
[09:13:37] <rohan> databse got updated.
[09:13:52] <Ankabout> kborchers, and it always does the index of the immediate parent right?
[09:13:54] <rohan> <pachet> problem is with jq
[09:14:01] <Ankabout> I checked the docs, but just asking to be sure
[09:14:27] <kborchers> yes, index in relation to its siblings
[09:15:02] <Altreus> woot. thanks aaronmcadam :) Nice to know when you should be trying to make something work, and when it's not going to work in a basic case
[09:15:22] <aaronmcadam> always best to abstract your problem and work backwards
[09:15:30] <Altreus> yes that's right
[09:15:31] <pachet> rohan: ok, now bind that function to whatever event you want, and select the form elements to grab the right values
[09:15:39] <pachet> doneskies
[09:15:41] <aaronmcadam> especially to get help on here
[09:15:47] <Altreus> I made it as simple as possible, but no simpler :)
[09:15:52] <aaronmcadam> least your a good student Altreus :P
[09:16:04] <Altreus> heh I'll remember jsfiddle before asking next time
[09:16:22] * Altreus never does anything wrong
[09:16:29] <silo> Anyone know if its possible to absolutely position a div relative to a jquery mobile dialog? the div needs to be positioned outside of the dialog, but still a child of the dialog div.
[09:16:29] <aaronmcadam> lol
[09:17:26] <enyovelcora> I'm used to prototype, and fairly new to jQueryâ€¦ When I have a .each() iterator, the Â»thisÂ« keyword is always bound to the current element. How do I access the enveloping object?
[09:17:38] <enyovelcora> Do I have to assign Â»thisÂ« to a local variable before the iteration?
[09:17:45] <Ox41> I dont really understand why this code never gets run:       $(document).ready(function(){ alert('in function'); });
[09:17:45] <Haprog> wtf. If I'm using .load() with IE6-8 it fucks up all html5 elements if the page to load() begins with a whitespace (even while I'm using the html5shiv). for example <nav>stuff</nav> becomes <nav/>stuff</nav/> and behaves like "stuff" isn't even contained in <nav>. works fine in IE9 and other browsers though.
[09:17:57] <enyovelcora> Or is there a better way to do this
[09:18:06] <Altreus> enyovelcora: generally one does var $this = $(this);  and then $this in the each() function is the outer element, not the iterator element
[09:18:26] <discorpia> Ox41: hmm, it should work. do you get any js errors?
[09:18:27] <aaronmcadam> enyovelcora: that's the easiest or else $(this).parent()
[09:18:37] <Altreus> enyovelcora: Choose any sensible name for $this :)
[09:18:38] <aaronmcadam> within your each func
[09:19:11] <aaronmcadam> I use self
[09:19:14] <Altreus> aaronmcadam: Doesn't work for the general case :) (e.g. $(this).find('span').each(...) -- spans can be at any depth)
[09:19:32] <aaronmcadam> he said enveloping, i figured he meant the parent
[09:19:39] <enyovelcora> Thanks to all.. I was wondering, since in prototype you'd do: [].each(function() { }, this); Where Â»thisÂ« specifies which object the iterator should be bound to
[09:19:40] <Altreus> fair point
[09:19:54] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[09:20:06] <aaronmcadam> never had the *pleasure* of using prototype anyway
[09:20:11] <Altreus> enyovelcora: nah jQuery just makes you use closures :)
[09:20:42] <aaronmcadam> i'm sure the each implementation uses closures too Altreus
[09:20:46] <aaronmcadam> to pass in the context of the this
[09:20:52] <enyovelcora> Yes they do
[09:21:03] <enyovelcora> All in all, I must say that this stuff is better in prototype
[09:21:15] <enyovelcora> jQuery is very cool in other points though
[09:21:18] <Altreus> There are two reasons jQuery could have done it this way:
[09:21:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah but prototype is probably for people who know js really
[09:21:25] <Altreus> 1) They spotted something prototype didn't
[09:21:29] <Altreus> 2) They didn't think of that
[09:21:37] <aaronmcadam> code usability i'd say
[09:21:41] <Altreus> or the hidden option 3) They wanted to be different
[09:21:51] <enyovelcora> Mh.. Altreus don't sure if it's any of that
[09:22:00] <enyovelcora> in fact: prototype dos NOT bind the iteration element to this
[09:22:01] <aaronmcadam> i think it's API usability
[09:22:06] <enyovelcora> It's just a design choice
[09:22:21] <aaronmcadam> for less experienced devs and yeah the keep it simple idea
[09:22:23] <enyovelcora> in prototype you HAVE TO use an iteration parameter to access the current element
[09:22:39] <enyovelcora> so in prototype it's always: [].each(function(element) { });
[09:22:42] <Altreus> I do think it strange that jQuery has the iterator var both in `this` and in the second argument
[09:22:47] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: you can also use $.proxy
[09:22:52] <ajpiano> to bind the scope of a handler
[09:22:54] <aaronmcadam> most all jquery's main funcs just use one param
[09:23:01] <aaronmcadam> a function as a callback
[09:23:04] <aaronmcadam> ah
[09:23:05] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: that's what I was thinking ofâ€¦ seems a bit much though
[09:23:15] <Altreus> I almost always do $.each(thing, function(i, elem) {} );
[09:23:27] <enyovelcora> Altreus: well.. they have to have it in both
[09:23:33] <Altreus> yeah that is odd imo
[09:23:36] <gnarf> enyovelcora: what stuff?
[09:23:42] <aaronmcadam> haha
[09:23:48] <enyovelcora> because, if you do $.each([], function() { }) and the array contains strings / integers, then Â»thisÂ« can't just be an integer
[09:23:51] <aaronmcadam> Altreus: do u know what this is?
[09:24:19] <kborchers> enter the lurking gnarf ... dun dun dunnnnn ;)
[09:24:25] <Altreus> do you mean this in English or the this pointer in JS? :3
[09:24:30] <Altreus> "pointer"
[09:24:53] <gnarf> "keyword"
[09:25:02] <enyovelcora> gnarf: Â»what stuff?Â« ??
[09:25:08] <ajpiano> enyovelcora:  when we were adding scope manip to jquery, it was originally going to be the type of thing you suggested
[09:25:12] <gnarf> enyovelcora: "this stuff is better in prototype"
[09:25:20] <ajpiano> where various functions would accept a 'thisArg' type thing
[09:25:22] <aaronmcadam> keyword yes
[09:25:35] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: but?
[09:25:43] <ajpiano> but $.proxy is considerably more flexible
[09:25:45] <Altreus> Keyword is a lexical term; but the `this` keyword has a runtime significance, in that it is also a variable
[09:26:00] <ajpiano> this way you can set the scope of anything any time you pass a func to anything
[09:26:13] <enyovelcora> gnarf: ohâ€¦ :) didn't read *that* far backâ€¦ well: the binding in general
[09:26:19] <ajpiano> as opposed to us crapping up the method signatures of those places where we *guess* that you might need to manipulate 'this'
[09:26:23] <enyovelcora> iterations
[09:26:37] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: I agree with you.. that syntax is not very intuitive
[09:27:47] <enyovelcora> I'm really very astonished that jQuery has *that* few array functions
[09:27:59] <aaronmcadam> enyovelcora: underscore baby
[09:28:14] <bentkus> I got an element like "<span class="id">innertext</span>", now if I use .html() on it it will return only innertext, can I return the outer text too? (the entire quoted string)
[09:28:15] <enyovelcora> ?
[09:28:19] <aaronmcadam> good point ajpiano
[09:28:28] <aaronmcadam> api consistency is important really
[09:28:32] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: yea i was about to say, use underscore bro
[09:28:51] <aaronmcadam> me and ajpiano love that shittt
[09:29:03] <enyovelcora> In what context? sorryâ€¦ I don't get the drift
[09:29:09] <gnarf> bentkus: .parent().html()
[09:29:09] <aaronmcadam> 3k minified, and BAM! ecma shim sexyness
[09:29:18] <gnarf> bentkus: or if its not the only child
[09:29:20] <aaronmcadam> and loadsa other lovely stuff
[09:29:22] <ajpiano> use it if you need lots of nifty array helpers
[09:29:30] <aaronmcadam> i love the toArray func!
[09:29:34] <gnarf> bentkus: .clone().wrap("<div>").parent().html()
[09:29:46] <ajpiano> that happen to accept scope as a paarm
[09:29:47] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: where can I find documentation bout it?
[09:30:08] <gnarf> ?g underscore js
[09:30:08] <aaronmcadam> ?g underscore js @ enyovelcora
[09:30:09] <bot-t> gnarf, Underscore.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[09:30:09] <bot-t> enyovelcora, Underscore.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[09:30:13] <aaronmcadam> hehe :D
[09:30:25] <aaronmcadam> love it
[09:30:37] <enyovelcora> :)
[09:30:46] <Jack80> I developed a little script that make texts like they were coming from far, with Jquery and animate() function. Everything works well in IE and FireFox but on Chrome is very laggy, like it was loosing frames.
[09:30:46] <Jack80> Could someone please help me to figure this out? You can test and play with the code here: http://jsbin.com/ehahoc/7/
[09:30:50] <enyovelcora> Weird that it's not part of jQuery....
[09:30:56] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: why would it be
[09:30:59] <aaronmcadam> haha
[09:31:14] <gnarf> i kinda wish we had reduce
[09:31:20] <gnarf> there have been times i wanted it
[09:31:24] <aaronmcadam> hmm yeah
[09:31:25] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: jQuery is designed to be, well, jQuery...not... every single useful function that anyone could ever conceive of needing
[09:31:33] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[09:31:38] <gnarf> but i just included underscore and got it
[09:31:40] <gnarf> :)
[09:31:47] <aaronmcadam> pow right in the kisser!
[09:31:59] <aaronmcadam> lovely stuff
[09:32:14] <aaronmcadam> so easy for adding totals in a basket, for example
[09:32:33] <Camer0n> how can i add something to the end of the html of a div?
[09:32:39] <ajpiano> ?append
[09:32:39] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:32:40] <Camer0n> without changing the values of the current things
[09:32:45] <Camer0n> k thanks
[09:32:49] <whodat> i put this in the keypress event of a drop down (so that it does an additional keypress of an 'enter') but its not working.. it does not do the same thing as if i actually hit the enter key manually.. any ideas?
[09:32:52] <enyovelcora> Well thanks a lot. Will definitely use underscore
[09:32:56] <enyovelcora> Looks great
[09:32:58] <aaronmcadam> cool
[09:32:59] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: yeah - had a dom selection and wanted to sum a bunch of shit from the .data()
[09:33:01] <whodat> $(this).trigger({ type: 'keypress', which: 13 });
[09:33:09] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: most of those undersscore iterators also accept scope as a third param
[09:33:25] <aaronmcadam> enyovelcora: http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/07/easy-functional-programming-in-javascript-with-underscore-js-part-2/
[09:33:29] <aaronmcadam> quick intro
[09:33:40] <aaronmcadam> nice usage gnarf :D
[09:34:03] <aaronmcadam> i think sometimes with awesome util libraries like underscore, half the thing is figuring out a good use case for them
[09:34:13] <enyovelcora> (ajpiano: to be honest: I never really liked the third param scope thingâ€¦. :) Was just wondering how it's done normally in jQuery)
[09:34:18] <aaronmcadam> i mean all its cool methods
[09:34:23] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: hehe phew
[09:34:23] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: it ended up like _( $selection.map(function() { return $(this).data('number'); }).get() ).reduce( function ( a, b ) { return a+b; });
[09:34:26] <aaronmcadam> underscore.string is pretty cool too gnarf
[09:34:37] <aaronmcadam> how sweet is that!
[09:34:59] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: it's weird... like, i like having it there in underscore when i'm using it, but i don't think it's an appropriate thing for jQuery
[09:35:42] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: Mh.. yeah I don't know where I'd draw the lineâ€¦
[09:36:21] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: I feel that utility functions that are used *all the time* could be part of the framework itself
[09:36:31] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: I'd consider filters and such as core functionality
[09:36:50] <ajpiano> jquery gives you $.map $.each $.grep
[09:37:01] <Jack80> no one can help me? :)
[09:37:11] <Elephant> mmmmmmm .position() is quite maddening
[09:37:21] <ajpiano> also i think that given the fact that jquery has busted the signatures of those things, we're kind of in a bind when it comes to adding more generic iterators
[09:38:11] <enyovelcora> I feel that .detect() (or find() if you prefer the name) should have made it into the framework
[09:38:29] <aaronmcadam> detect?
[09:38:32] <enyovelcora> with only $.each, I guess that most people are going to use: $.each().first()
[09:38:43] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean in this instance?
[09:38:47] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: huh
[09:38:53] <enyovelcora> (ah sorryâ€¦. $.grep().first())
[09:38:55] <ajpiano> find the index of an element in an array?
[09:39:14] <aaronmcadam> that's one method i've never used
[09:39:23] <enyovelcora> in prototype you have detect/find which is the same as $.grep().first() but it doesn't iterator over the whole array
[09:39:36] <enyovelcora> but stops as soon as the first element is found
[09:39:44] <aaronmcadam> ah right i gotcha
[09:40:02] <ajpiano> meh, i donno.  we have $.inArray
[09:40:03] <aaronmcadam> what if u want all the amtches?
[09:40:08] <ajpiano> but that only... works in arrays
[09:40:25] <enyovelcora> amtches?
[09:40:28] <aaronmcadam> surely that should be an option, whether u want the first
[09:40:30] <aaronmcadam> matches*
[09:40:32] <ajpiano> i really don't think that $.grep(fn)[0] is a tough pill to swallow
[09:40:46] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: Depends on the size of your array
[09:40:47] <aaronmcadam> nopes
[09:41:08] <enyovelcora> aaronmcadam: of course you also have .filter() in prototype, which returns all found instances
[09:41:20] <aaronmcadam> could u not just use filter and then return if it matches
[09:41:29] <aaronmcadam> to stop iterating over the whole array
[09:42:05] <enyovelcora> aaronmcadam: if you return in an iterator when using filter()
[09:42:13] <aaronmcadam> I really need to find some good tips on api design tho
[09:42:15] <enyovelcora> the next element in the array will be tried
[09:42:33] <aaronmcadam> can you break?
[09:43:07] <enyovelcora> don't think so
[09:43:09] <danzik17> enyovelcora: Could you not do something like this like I posted earlier?  http://jsfiddle.net/H4JLg/
[09:44:36] <enyovelcora> danzik17: At first glance this code doesn't seem to be correct
[09:45:27] <danzik17> enyovelcora: And on subsequent glances?  (grabbing lunch, brb).
[09:46:21] <enyovelcora> danzik17: Oh! I'm sorry
[09:46:27] <enyovelcora> I'm a newbie to jQuery
[09:46:43] <enyovelcora> Well, that's exactly what I was talking about
[09:46:56] <enyovelcora> I didn't know you could break the each loop by returning false
[09:47:34] <Ox41> return... returns
[09:47:36] <Ox41> immediately.
[09:47:38] <Ox41> so yup
[09:47:54] <enyovelcora> (I thought that your test worked because 3 only occurred once.. your test case is not very elaborate :) )

[09:57:28] <krogant> hi, i'm trying to work with the validation plugin, and - for styling - when an input has an invalid value, would like to bubble up to a certain div.foo and add a new class. i can't find any callback / event process for doing this, so any other ideas please?
[09:59:32] * muzone_ is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/alphapup/young-montana-sacre-cool
[09:59:54] <muzone_> damn script
[09:59:54] <muzone_> sorry yall
[10:01:40] <SEJeff_work> Is there a way to say $("#some_selector").find(an element AFTER #some_selector)
[10:03:05] <kborchers> SEJeff_work: by after do you mean a following sibling? see ?nextAll
[10:03:06] <bot-t> SEJeff_work, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[10:03:08] <SEJeff_work> It is on a form, where #some_selector is an input, and I'd like to select the first text input box _after_ it
[10:04:13] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: no one knows what you mean by "after"
[10:04:47] <ajpiano> after could mean... below it in the DOM... one of its "next" siblings... one if its next siblings descendants..... etc.
[10:05:03] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, below it in the dom.
[10:05:11] <ajpiano> so a descendant?
[10:05:12] <SEJeff_work> .nextAll() doesn't seem to do it
[10:05:23] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, Please define descendant
[10:05:30] <Brodingo> no u
[10:05:41] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: <foo> <bar> </foo>
[10:05:45] <ajpiano> bar is a descendant of foo
[10:06:16] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: you should post your html somewher
[10:06:42] <azazul> hi
[10:06:58] <azazul> how can i get back then native object which has been wrapped in $() ?
[10:07:10] <azazul> s/object/html element
[10:07:21] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, The horrible html looks like this: http://dpaste.org/UZNuE/ if $("#id_add_device") is $(this), how would I select the very next input:text? The answer happens to be #id_user in that example but I don't know the way to make that generic
[10:07:21] <danzik171> Is there a generally accepted way (or...just a good way) to write testable javascript that gets certain values from the DOM?  I've got http://jsfiddle.net/FNKUN/1/ so far, looking for alternatives if there's a better way
[10:07:26] <SEJeff_work> the html is created by django-uni_form
[10:09:05] <JAAulde> When I open a UI dialog which has some inputs, the first input is focused automatically...why is this?
[10:09:50] <JAAulde> if I unfocus it, close the dialog, and reopen the dialog, it has focus again
[10:09:55] <JAAulde> this is obnoxious and I want t to tsotp
[10:10:02] <JAAulde> 8to stop*
[10:10:06] <JAAulde> oi, cannot type
[10:11:18] <azazul> is there any _other_ way how to get the native HTML element besides using : $( variable ).get(0) ?
[10:11:39] <kborchers> $( variable )[0]
[10:12:05] <azazul> isnt that value .. emm .. untrustworthy ?
[10:12:16] <tbranyen> no
[10:12:20] <tbranyen> its identical
[10:12:26] <tbranyen> minus not needing a function call
[10:12:28] <krogant> how do i bubble up to a certain selector?
[10:12:44] <azazul> no , i mean , cannot hrer be more then one element in that list an order change ?
[10:12:49] <krogant> .parents('#foo') should work right?
[10:12:52] <tbranyen> azazul: its the same thing as get 0
[10:12:56] <tbranyen> i dunno what you're asking
[10:13:10] <azazul> i have $(variable)
[10:13:17] <azazul> i need to get native HTMLElement
[10:13:32] <tbranyen> $(something) isn't necessarily a 1:1 to a single element
[10:13:34] <tbranyen> it can be a collection
[10:13:39] <azazul> $(variable).get(0) does the trick
[10:13:40] <tbranyen> hence why there is get(index) and [index]
[10:13:51] <tbranyen> "the trick" they both work dude
[10:14:00] <tbranyen> $(variable)[0] === $(variable).get(0)
[10:14:01] <azazul> huh ?
[10:14:14] <azazul> that is not what i am asking
[10:14:39] <azazul> will .. that collection always contain only 1 element ?
[10:14:54] <tbranyen> maybe? i don't know what you're doing in your code.  maybe not
[10:15:23] <azazul> i am selecting a dom element
[10:15:49] <Connor_> .get(0) returns the first element
[10:15:55] <Connor_> 0 is an index
[10:15:57] <azazul> forst element of what ?
[10:15:59] <Connor_> .get() wooul
[10:16:01] <azazul> *first
[10:16:08] <Connor_> Whatever you are selecting
[10:16:12] <Connor_> If you have 5 divs on your page
[10:16:18] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: $(this).parent().next().find("input").first()
[10:16:22] <Connor_> And you do $('div').get(0) OR $('div')[0]
[10:16:26] <Connor_> It will get the first div
[10:16:29] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: this is why "afteR" is a nebulous concept"
[10:16:32] <azazul> i guess i got it
[10:16:34] <Connor_> Beceause you are retriving the div with index of 0
[10:16:42] <ajpiano> cause "after" in the dom and after your brain are different things
[10:16:46] <azazul> what a meesed up api
[10:16:52] <Connor_> .get(0) and [0] is just getting the array with the key of 0
[10:16:55] <muley> lol
[10:16:57] <Connor_> array element sorry
[10:17:16] <Connor_> Read the documentation :P
[10:17:52] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, Perfect!
[10:18:01] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: FYI
[10:18:04] <ajpiano> the other way to do it
[10:18:07] <ajpiano> is to get a collectino of all inputs
[10:18:08] <SEJeff_work> Is there a difference other than semantics between :first in the selector or .first()?
[10:18:10] <ajpiano> var input = $("input")
[10:18:17] <ajpiano> and then use one to go to the next
[10:18:28] <muley> azazul: if you select by ID, you can guarantee .get(0) will be the element (as long as it exists)
[10:18:28] <eddiemonge> SEJeff_work: you mean like performance difference?
[10:18:32] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, Well I bind a keypress event to 1 specific input
[10:18:41] <ajpiano> var nextInput = inputs.eq( $(this).index() + 1);
[10:18:41] <SEJeff_work> eddiemonge, Just a difference at all. I'm just curious
[10:18:56] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, Oh thats actually pretty clean. Very very cool. Thanks!
[10:19:03] <JAAulde> http://jsfiddle.net/CGhEc/ - how do I make the input stop receiving focus every time the dialog opens? I don't want the datepicker showing until the user clicks.
[10:19:19] <eddiemonge> SEJeff_work: that was a subtle hint that there is a perf diff. you can also use .first() in chains with .end()
[10:19:39] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: yeah it's a lot nicer when you have a DOM like that, to just go through the set, rather than these crazy up and down traversals that can break if the DOM breaks
[10:19:51] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: i would say to prefer .first()
[10:19:55] <ajpiano> :first sucks perf wise
[10:19:56] <SEJeff_work> eddiemonge, I just was curious if 1 did something different than the other. I tend to use :first, but don't really have a reason why other than thats how I first learned it
[10:20:09] <SEJeff_work> ajpiano, good to know
[10:20:13] <SEJeff_work> eddiemonge, thanks
[10:20:31] <Connor_> @JAAulde bind the input to click instead of the P
[10:20:43] <azazul> muley: i guess that will do , thnx
[10:20:48] <muley> =]
[10:20:52] <JAAulde> Connor_: the P opens the dialog
[10:21:00] <JAAulde> (so unrelated)
[10:21:11] <Connor_> The P triggers the date box to show
[10:21:13] <Connor_> And the input to show
[10:22:34] <JAAulde> Connor_: I need something which exists in the DOM to cause a dialog to open (in my example, the P). That dialog needs to have inputs within. WHen the dialog shows, I do not want the inputs to gain focus automatically. I do not understand how your suggestion fixes what I am asking about...
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> JAAulde: that's how dialog works :/
[10:23:38] <JAAulde> ajpiano:  is dialog doing it internally by calling focus on the first input?
[10:23:49] <Connor_> @JAAulde, .datepicker() is focusing the input
[10:23:59] <JAAulde> Connor_: it is?
[10:24:00] <Connor_> You can go dif through the jQuery UI source if you really want to fix it
[10:24:15] <Connor_> Well, there is nothing in the code you have written that auto focus' it
[10:24:22] <JAAulde> calling datepicker on an element has never cause it to focus in any other context
[10:24:42] <JAAulde> Connor_: ajpiano says dialog is doing it
[10:24:55] <Connor_> It may be, my point is, jQuery UI is doing it
[10:25:10] <Connor_> So you will have to either A) find an option in the documentation to turn it off
[10:25:14] <Connor_> Or B) alter the source
[10:25:15] <JAAulde> Connor_: well, yes, I assumed so. My question was how can I make it stop, lol
[10:25:30] <ajpiano> JAAulde: dialog focuses on the first thing that can be tabbed to when it's open
[10:25:42] <ajpiano> put like, an anchor or something else before it in the dialog
[10:25:57] <JAAulde> ajpiano: bah, suckage. I can see some value in that, but when the first thing is a datepicker or whatevs, it just looks dumb
[10:26:18] <ajpiano> JAAulde: you can just put a tabindex attribute
[10:26:20] <ajpiano> on anything
[10:26:23] <JAAulde> ajpiano: yeah, I'll have to do some trick like that. thanks
[10:26:32] <ajpiano> and it should get you going there
[10:26:33] <ajpiano> kk
[10:26:55] <JAAulde> the fact that dialog does that, though, just seesm like bloat and "because we can" :(
[10:27:00] <ajpiano> lol
[10:27:02] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[10:27:11] <ajpiano> typically when someone opens a dialog
[10:27:14] <ajpiano> and it has input
[10:27:21] <ajpiano> they want the user to interct with the input
[10:27:27] <ajpiano> not... have to manually click into it first
[10:27:38] <JAAulde> yeah, I see what you're saying. but that's not hard to add to the open event if desired
[10:27:48] <JAAulde> but yeah
[10:27:52] <JAAulde> I get it
[10:28:20] <kborchers> JAAulde; 1.9 will let you configure what is focused in dialog http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/dialog-api-redesign/
[10:28:35] <ajpiano> yah
[10:28:42] <JAAulde> kborchers: cool, cool.  thanks
[10:28:49] <ajpiano> and also the idea that somehow doing it automatically is some bloaty self-indulgent "because we can" feature
[10:28:52] <ajpiano> is like... hyperbole
[10:28:55] <ajpiano> :)
[10:28:58] <JAAulde> maybe
[10:31:00] <JackBauer24> Anyone know why this code doesn't detect anchor's parent? http://pastebin.com/b0k8DfHn
[10:31:45] <eddiemonge> JackBauer24: you need to do var $this = $(this) before the ajax call and then use $this in the call
[10:32:17] <eddiemonge> and e.preventDefault() would be better there than return false
[10:32:22] <SEJeff_work> JAAulde, You could always not use jquery and write your own library or fork it if you feel that strongly :)
[10:32:52] <JackBauer24> eddiemonge: thanks, everything works now :) and thanks for the tip
[10:33:06] <JAAulde> oh come on, to call one thing somewhat bloaty and to say it seems like it's "because we can" isn't to knock the entire lib or say it's useless
[10:33:09] <JAAulde> stfu
[10:33:26] * JAAulde is pissy, unrleated to this issue. sorry
[10:41:05] <Connor_> Is the 'this' object the element being animated when using animate() ?
[10:43:18] <eddiemonge> console.log it and see
[10:59:02] <mikedoty> Is there a way I can bind a function to the close.facebox event that will let me decide whether or not to proceed with closing it?  (i.e. "Are you sure you want to close this facebox, you have unsaved changes) ?
[10:59:17] <ShaneN> Hello. I've got an element in my document named "application". There is also a global variable named "application". When I type in "application" in Chrome's console, it shows the global object. If I set a breakpoint inside of a click handler and type in "application" again, it returns the DOM element. Any idea why?
[11:02:30] <ShaneN> I'm doing this in a chrome extension. I cannot reproduce it standalone.
[11:03:11] <ajpiano> ShaneN: you know that chrome extensions work in an isolated environment
[11:03:22] <ajpiano> and can't acccess global variables from the actual page?
[11:03:30] <ShaneN> ajpiano: Ah, that would explain it...
[11:03:54] <ShaneN> I recall reading that now that you mention it, but I apparently forgot between then and now. Thank you
[11:03:54] <ajpiano> http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html#execution-environment
[11:03:58] <ajpiano> :)
[11:04:30] <Danielss89> hi.,, i have a problem with metadata http://sccups.com/tournament/tournament/13 <-- click bracket and then on one of the nunbers
[11:04:59] <Danielss89> it returns an object but i can't get the data "boxId" from the metadata :(
[11:05:10] <savid> What you guys think about this boiler plate for plugins:  http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ ?   Are there any downsides to this?  Seems a lot simpler than the jquery example...
[11:05:23] <ajpiano> savid: it sucks
[11:05:53] <ajpiano> savid: https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-boilerplate/issues/11
[11:05:55] <ajpiano> for my thoughts on that
[11:06:17] <ajpiano> savid: here's a bunch of food for thought https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[11:07:54] <savid> ajpiano, cool.  Thanks!
[11:11:46] <Birliban> hi, how to get the keys and not the values of a json object?
[11:12:56] <ajpiano> for (var k in ob) { console.log(k);  }
[11:13:06] <ajpiano> or Object.keys where it's available :)
[11:13:15] <ajpiano> ?eval typeof Object.keys
[11:13:16] <bot-t> ajpiano: "undefined"
[11:13:45] <javex> If I use multiple selectors (like $(".class1,.class2").click, is it possible to get the selector that triggered the event, so in that case ".class1" or ".class2" (and not by this.attr('class') since I got multiple classes for each element)
[11:13:58] <Danielss89> i have a problem with metadata http://sccups.com/tournament/tournament/13 <-- click bracket and then on one of the nunbers, it returns an object but i can't get the data "boxId" from the metadata
[11:15:40] <Birliban> ajpiano, thx your first example works, but isnt there a 'jquery' way?
[11:16:11] <Birliban> i get the json with $.getJSON()
[11:16:59] <smplstk> Birliban: there's no simpler/better way with jQuery that I'm aware of for getting obj keys
[11:17:03] <Birliban> aim is to build up a whole dynamic table with the keys as table headers and values as cells
[11:17:26] <ajpiano> Birliban: ... $.each(obj, function(k, v) {  console.log(k); })
[11:17:43] <ajpiano> or well
[11:18:22] <John_Dee> Can someone help me get the start/stop functionality to work, and also to find a way for the main function to cycle through the elements endlessly instead of just once? â€” http://jsfiddle.net/yUuf2/
[11:19:25] <whodat> why does this give me a -1 instead of a 2?   (the selection i picked was the 3rd option in the dropdown)  $('select[id*=myfield]').click(function() { alert ( $('select[id*=myfield]').attr('selectedIndex')  )
[11:20:00] <Connor_> @whodat try .eq() instead of attr('selectedIndex')
[11:20:07] <Connor_> I assume you are trying to get the index of the element that was clicked
[11:20:08] <ajpiano> huh
[11:20:20] <whodat> connor: selectedIndex always seems to be 1 iteration behind... :(
[11:20:20] <Birliban> ajpiano, this looks smooth, i'll try it. thanks!
[11:20:21] <ajpiano> .eq() isn't... a getter... of anything
[11:20:22] <Connor_> Actually, you would have to do $(this).eq() inside the bind
[11:20:38] <ajpiano> whodat: try .prop("selectedIndex")
[11:21:12] <whodat> ok ajpiano
[11:21:13] <ajpiano> whodat: you should also use the .change() event instead of .click()
[11:22:27] <whodat> ok i will try both ideas thanks
[11:23:44] <whodat> i changed .click to .change .. it is still 1 iteration behind... i get a -1 and then a 2 when clicking on the same option in the dropdown twice.
[11:27:23] <eddiemonge> whodat: wrap the the thing you are looking for in quotes too as in $('input[type="test"]') (wrapping test in quotes)
[11:28:08] <ajpiano> whodat: does this work as expected? http://jsfiddle.net/jJLPk/1/
[11:28:11] <whodat> double quotes within single quotes lol
[11:28:29] <ajpiano> whodat: technically the inner quotes are required in attribute selectors
[11:28:34] <ajpiano> and definiteyl to make it faster
[11:28:41] <whodat> good to know
[11:29:04] <eddiemonge> whodat: there is nothing wrong with quotes in quotes. its how its done
[11:29:11] <metaperl> $('ul li').filter('.current');Â   // cant this be written as $('ul li .current')
[11:29:19] <pachet> quotes in quotes killed my father
[11:29:39] <whodat> ajpiano: yes it does
[11:31:18] <enyovelcora> What is the easies way to call a iterator on every item in an object?
[11:31:25] <enyovelcora> Should I use $.map for that?
[11:31:28] <whodat> alert($(this).attr('selectedIndex'));
[11:31:28] <whodat> alert($(this).attr('selectedIndex'));
[11:31:36] <enyovelcora> Even if I don't care about the result?
[11:31:38] <whodat> oops
[11:31:38] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: $.each ?
[11:31:50] <whodat> ajpaino: can you add that line i just posted to it
[11:31:59] <Connor_> Can anyone see anything wrong with this line: setTimeout("slideAcross(" + $(this) + ")", delay);
[11:32:09] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: Mh.. I need to add a class to every jQuery object inside an array
[11:32:17] <stodge> Is it ok to ask here about jquery plugins?
[11:32:23] <enyovelcora> With .each() I have to write it like this, right? :
[11:32:30] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: why do you have an array of jQuery objects :/
[11:32:31] <enyovelcora> $.each(elements, function() { this.addClass('empty') });
[11:32:47] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: Wellâ€¦ I have a plugin which handles form input fieldds
[11:33:04] <enyovelcora> And on initialization it goes through them, and stores the input fields in question in an array
[11:33:20] <WebDragon> anyone around here ever worked with prettyPhoto jquery plugin ?
[11:33:25] <ajpiano> why not store references to jquery objects and use a jquery object as the storage as well
[11:33:58] <ajpiano> var inputs = $("input");   inputs = inputs.add(".moreInputs") etc
[11:34:10] <enyovelcora> mhâ€¦ I don't know.. maybe you have an idea of how to handle that the best:
[11:34:16] <enyovelcora> I have a sort of field decorator
[11:34:18] <enyovelcora> which takes an input
[11:34:29] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: in any event, if you *do* have arrays of jquery objects, the iteration you posted should be fine
[11:34:37] <ajpiano> using map isn't somehow superior
[11:34:38] <enyovelcora> and transforms it in possibly multiple inputs (e.g.: selects for a birthday) and labels and stuff
[11:35:05] <enyovelcora> so it returns an object: { input: jQueryInput, label: jQueryLabel, etc...}
[11:35:05] <zeta-> metaperl: no space in li.current ?
[11:35:13] <enyovelcora> I need to be able to access the input
[11:35:23] <metaperl> zeta i'm not sure how to process that
[11:35:25] <ajpiano> ah
[11:35:28] <metaperl> zeta i need to recall my question first
[11:35:30] <ajpiano> so you need to pluck
[11:35:40] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: to be honest.. I don't really fancy my approachâ€¦ but I don't really see how I could do it differently
[11:35:49] <metaperl> oh here it is -  $('ul li').filter('.current');Â   // cant this be written as $('ul li .current')
[11:35:55] <enyovelcora> Because now I can't just call: myElements.addClass()
[11:35:57] <enyovelcora> obviously
[11:36:08] <metaperl> zeta - i was doing a descending css selector
[11:36:34] <ajpiano> metaperl: no,... $("ul li.current") would translate to $("ul li .current")
[11:36:35] <metaperl> i thought it would be the same filtering that the final class
[11:36:38] <ajpiano> afejwklafjklamfl
[11:36:44] <enyovelcora> ajpiano: Do you have an idea on how to better store / pass around those objects, and still work with a  jQuery object?
[11:36:46] <ajpiano> metaperl: no,... $("ul li.current") would translate to $("ul li").filter(".current")
[11:37:04] <Perel> Quick jqueryui question, if that's ok here.. i am trying to use .position relative to the viewport. Docs say you can do this but not how.. am I missing something simple here?
[11:37:15] <ajpiano> enyovelcora: this is exceedingly vague, but are you familiar with jQuery's .data() API
[11:37:29] <tgodar> spinner for tabs UI is goofy... that took me a while to figure out
[11:37:49] <ajpiano> metaperl: $("ul li .current") is $("ul li").find("current")
[11:38:22] <metaperl> $('ul li. current') means - "under a <ul>, find an <li> that has a class = 'current' ... is that not what the expression ... oh so find takes a class name? i need to go read the API. I was reading jQuery Fundamentals and this example was not explained
[11:38:43] <ajpiano> metaperl: find takes a SELECTOR
[11:38:45] <ajpiano> any selector
[11:39:00] <metaperl> if find takes a sector then current would have to a tag, not a class
[11:39:16] <ajpiano> lol
[11:39:21] <ajpiano> i don't think you know what a selector is
[11:39:23] <metaperl> find ("current") would try to find a tag current find ".current" would try to find a class=current in a tag
[11:39:27] <ajpiano> oh
[11:39:31] <ajpiano> i may have typoed
[11:39:31] <metaperl> ajpiano: i guess not
[11:39:47] <ajpiano> metaperl: no
[11:39:52] <ajpiano> your statement was incorrect
[11:40:17] <pachet> i need that on a mug
[11:40:21] <ajpiano> $('ul li. current') means - "under a <ul>, find ANY ELEMENT with the class "current" that is inside of an LI"
[11:40:32] <ajpiano> well $("ul li .current") means that ^^
[11:40:40] <metaperl> yes
[11:40:41] <ajpiano> $("ul li. current") is just malformed
[11:41:05] <Perel> nm, found it in a different example
[11:43:17] <metaperl> i wish jQuery Fundamentals had one more level of detail in the TOC ... or maybe 2
[11:43:36] <WebDragon> anyone around here ever worked with prettyPhoto jquery plugin ?
[11:44:01] <WebDragon> bloody thing isn't working properly for small iconish sized gallery of awards on this one page I have
[11:44:02] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I bind a click function in this way: $('a').each(function() { $(this).bind('click', function () { alert('clicked!' ) }) }) Whenever I click on any A element alert is showing twice. Why this happens?
[11:44:16] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: you don't have to do it that way anyway
[11:44:18] <WebDragon> not sure if it's because the original wordpress theme author broke it or because of some other reason
[11:44:33] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: $("a").click(function() { }) or .bind(...
[11:44:34] <OnkelTem> ajpiano: what I do wrong?
[11:44:40] <ajpiano> willl bind to every element int he collection
[11:44:42] <ajpiano> you don't have to do .each
[11:44:43] <WebDragon> but I could use some help with understanding what the heck happened
[11:44:44] <OnkelTem> ajpiano: ah, ok, thanks! )
[11:45:21] <WebDragon> I have a link so you can see the problem in action
[11:45:30] <sphinxxx> with json, can i returned names of the indexes, or just the index #?
[11:45:41] <sphinxxx> like [0: some value, 1: some value]
[11:45:52] <sphinxxx> vs [name: some value, address: some value]
[11:46:14] <ajpiano>  lol sphinxxx yes
[11:46:21] <ajpiano> you can... return JSON string
[11:46:25] <ajpiano> that looks like an object literal
[11:46:27] <sphinxxx> my php file is returning json_encode($arr)
[11:46:37] <sphinxxx> so i suppose its more a php question
[11:46:45] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/about-us/awards/ the page (scroll down to the gallery of award icons and click one to see what happens)
[11:47:48] <matthPHP> Does anybody know if you can create an effect with jquery which is like a page flipping over?
[11:47:54] <WebDragon> whoops
[11:47:57] <WebDragon> now it should be on
[11:48:02] <OnkelTem> ajpiano: I changed to .click(). Well, message is shown twice. How could I know why?
[11:48:33] <eddiemonge> matthPHP: you can with css animations but its not supported everywhere
[11:49:05] <matthPHP> Hi eddiemonge: That's fine, it's for a presentation so we can specify the browser.
[11:49:19] <matthPHP> Have you seen such an example?
[11:49:37] <eddiemonge> i have but dont remember the link off the top of my head. google for CSS3 page animations
[11:51:08] <OnkelTem> I bind a click function in this way: $('a').click(function () { alert('clicked!' ) }) Whenever I click on any A element alert is showing twice. Any ideas what could be wrong?
[11:51:19] <Connor_> If I did .each() over 10 divs and had a function call underneath the .each statement, would the function be called once it has looped through all 10 divs, or would it run at the same time?
[11:51:33] <jinxdone> WebDragon, your images are just too small for the nav buttons to look any good?
[11:51:58] <matthPHP> Thanks, I'll have another look. Found lots that do book style curl overs but I just need a simple flip over
[11:52:15] <ahandy> passing a jquery variable to the animate function such as: $("p").animate({"width":"+=" + fluidWidth}); where fluidWidth = "250px". it should work properly correct?
[11:52:30] <WebDragon> possibly/probably -- I'm wondering if theres anyway I can find out what defaults the author set for the .prettyPhoto() call in his script by asking the debugger for a dump of it, somehow
[11:52:51] <matthPHP> Brilliant: This looks like the one http://css3playground.com/flip-card.php
[11:52:53] <phrearch> hello
[11:53:22] <phrearch> i made a simple plugin to load context menus on the fly, however somehow ctx.target is overwritten when more than one instance is created
[11:53:23] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476605/
[11:53:30] <phrearch> any idea whats wrong with the code?
[11:53:47] <DukeDrake> hi
[11:54:05] <Connor_> @WebDragon, just look at the source of the plugin
[11:54:15] <Connor_> Around line 402 in plugins.js
[11:54:36] <DukeDrake> if I got five consecutive elements with class=myclass", how can I tell on which one the user clicked?
[11:54:43] <DukeDrake> is there some .index() thing?
[11:54:52] <Connor_> Are you binding a click event to that class?
[11:54:52] * WebDragon smacks forehead
[11:55:22] <WebDragon> sorry I'm not myself today -- cracked a tooth on a piece of oatmeal on my sandwich's bread (whole grain stuff) this morning
[11:55:35] <WebDragon> don't ask me how I did that, because I've no clue, but ow ow ow
[11:55:52] <WebDragon> quite obviously it's making it a bit hard to think
[11:55:59] <Connor_> I can imagine :P
[11:58:01] <DukeDrake> Connor_: yes
[11:58:09] <jinxdone> DukeDrake, event.target
[11:58:39] <DukeDrake> click(function(event) {  I guess?
[11:58:40] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: i don't know.  do you have a live page? seems like the code that runs the bind is being executed twice
[11:59:12] <jinxdone> DukeDrake, yep
[11:59:41] <multipass> what is the cross browser way to go history -1?
[11:59:56] <PrgmrBill> leeloo dallas multipass
[12:00:03] <multipass> lol
[12:00:06] <multipass> :)
[12:00:11] <DukeDrake> jinxdone: not exactly what I need :/
[12:00:42] <kborchers> PrgmrBill: that statement was super green
[12:00:54] <DukeDrake> jinxdone: it's returning my href :/
[12:01:25] <moos3> how can i check if something is already in a array if is dont added
[12:01:33] <Connor_> @DukeDrake, just do $(this)
[12:01:37] <Connor_> Inside the click function
[12:01:41] <Connor_> Will return the element
[12:02:07] <DukeDrake> Connor_; $(this) .... ?
[12:02:28] <Connor_> Yeah. $('.myclass').click(function() { console.log($(this)); });
[12:03:20] <DukeDrake> [object Object]
[12:04:04] <Connor_> Lies
[12:04:08] <Connor_> Jsfiddle it
[12:04:38] <eddiemonge> this is the element. $(this) is the element wrapped with jquery
[12:04:59] <DukeDrake> ok
[12:05:22] <DukeDrake> it's returning "#", which is the obligate href element of the anchors with class 'myclass'
[12:05:32] <DukeDrake> ok, anyway
[12:05:34] <DukeDrake> gotta go now
[12:05:35] <DukeDrake> cya
[12:07:20] <madprops> im trying to fix the problem of not repeating the timeago function to elements that have it already, but adding it to the ones that dont have it. I'm trying this but newly added abbrs are not getting activated http://www.radpaste.com/192/  any ideas?
[12:07:54] <imajes> anyone know a way of getting around getcomputedstyle returning a width of 'auto' ?
[12:08:56] <eddiemonge> imajes: what is that for?
[12:09:11] <imajes> huh? i want to find the width of an element
[12:09:16] <imajes> that's not specified in css
[12:09:41] <take_it_t> hey guys, trying to figure out how i can use a list item and split a list in two, by inserting </ul><ul> before the <li>
[12:10:07] <take_it_t> insertBefore doesnt seem to be doing the trick according to firebug
[12:10:33] <webPragmatist> http://pastie.textmate.org/private/iehk0knft7mykmgzivs8ja
[12:10:46] <webPragmatist> ^^ is that proper way to use compatibility mode?
[12:10:52] <webPragmatist> i'm having an issue where that doesn't get run
[12:11:25] <eddiemonge> madprops: maybe you want something like this http://jsfiddle.net/LKQNh/1/
[12:11:36] <eddiemonge> imajes: .width()
[12:11:40] <imajes> returns 0.
[12:12:10] <eddiemonge> take_it_t: try before but you may have to manually add the items to a new list and then append it
[12:12:53] <webPragmatist> oh wait i'm stupid
[12:15:20] <eddiemonge> webPragmatist http://jsfiddle.net/ENPBR/
[12:16:17] <h32Lg> hey
[12:16:28] <eddiemonge> imajes: when are you calling it? what are you calling it on?
[12:16:46] <imajes> things that dont' have a width set in css
[12:17:51] <madprops> eddiemonge, what's the difference?
[12:18:03] <h32Lg> i'm doing sth like this: https://gist.github.com/1220193
[12:18:17] <h32Lg> but how can i add a loading indicator while the content is not loaded?
[12:19:06] <webPragmatist> how do i get $($this ol)
[12:19:14] <webPragmatist> $this.find('ol) ?
[12:19:23] <webPragmatist> really > ol
[12:21:07] <chrisalexthomas> hi, I'm using the data parameter given to the success() method after called $.post, I want to iterate over the members of data, but $.each, $(data).each all don't iterate, whats the beef?
[12:21:18] <eddiemonge> imajes: again, when are you calling it and what are you calling it on?
[12:21:27] <chrisalexthomas> I really am a bit surprised, it's actually the first time Iv'e tried to do it also, but I really thought it would work off the bat
[12:21:37] <eddiemonge> madprops: settimeout vs setinterval, cached selectors
[12:21:51] <chrisalexthomas> I've firebugged the data parameter and it does contain the data I want too, so it's not false, or empty, it has content
[12:22:05] <eddiemonge> ?child @ webPragmatist
[12:22:06] <bot-t> webPragmatist, parent > child: Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[12:22:16] <eddiemonge> ?children
[12:22:16] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[12:23:06] <eddiemonge> chrisalexthomas: whats data and how is .each not working?
[12:23:11] <chrisalexthomas> is it not possible to iterate over this particular object for some reason?
[12:23:45] <chrisalexthomas> eddiemonge: well, it's an Object according to firebug and when I call $(data).each(function(k,v){}) it does nothing
[12:23:59] <chrisalexthomas> if I put a var c=0; and then c++  in the function of the each, at the end, c=0
[12:24:08] <webPragmatist> anyone who uses "inline" javascript have a trick for getting the "previous" item instead of using an id?
[12:24:31] <davemo> webPragmatist: $(this).prev()
[12:24:47] <eddiemonge> chrisalexthomas: why not use for in?
[12:25:03] <webPragmatist> davemo: so if i stick that in <script it will pull "sister" item "up" one?
[12:25:07] <webPragmatist> left rather?
[12:25:08] <chrisalexthomas> eddiemonge: you can see the javascript here: http://www.themasterslounge.com/resources/login_area.js
[12:25:23] <davemo> webPragmatist: not sure what you mean, do you want to access the previous <script> element?
[12:25:34] <chrisalexthomas> eddiemonge: search for data.validation_errors,".validation_errors"
[12:25:52] <webPragmatist> i'll try it
[12:25:58] <chrisalexthomas> eddiemonge: line 48 I think according to firebug
[12:26:13] <chrisalexthomas> eddiemonge: I actually tried for(k in errors) and it didnt work
[12:26:29] <chrisalexthomas> errors is the name of the parameter I pass into the method, previously it was an element of data in the calling function
[12:26:37] <madprops> eddiemonge, im testing your solution. Strange thing with the previous one I had is that it would work fine on firefox but not on chrome
[12:28:20] <moos3> and anyone help me with my issue with inArray http://jsfiddle.net/moos3/xG3Q4/1/ my dispatchAll function, I can't figure out why its not working
[12:28:44] <madprops> eddiemonge, looks like its working, kudos man
[12:36:08] <chrisalexthomas> ok, sometimes I hate firefox, it's started to work now......urgh....
[12:36:23] <chrisalexthomas> sometimes it's js engine goes nuts and restarting it is the only way out
[12:36:40] <dropMAU5> is there a jQuery method for scrolling to an element?
[12:37:11] <chrisalexthomas> toScroll?
[12:37:16] <chrisalexthomas> scrollTo sorry
[12:38:03] <webPragmatist> davemo:  we have </ol><script></script> â€¦. trying to get "ol"
[12:38:26] <dropMAU5> in scriptaculous it would be scrollTo, but I think jquery's scrollTo just returns the position
[12:38:41] <webPragmatist> tried jQuery(this).prev()
[12:38:49] <webPragmatist> returns an empty object
[12:38:55] <davemo> webPragmatist: put and id on the markup, like this: <ol id="thing-to-get">, then in the script $('#thing-to-get')
[12:38:59] <webPragmatist> :(
[12:39:08] <webPragmatist> what are my other choices heh
[12:39:16] <multipass> is it possible to get the src of an iframe if you are inside the iframe?
[12:39:30] <webPragmatist> i don't like id because i have to now iterate and generate this id
[12:39:33] <davemo> not clear why you need to traverse the dom backwards webPragmatist
[12:39:39] <davemo> just assign an id, then it's easy
[12:39:39] <ajpiano> webPragmatist: pass the element into the func
[12:39:51] <ajpiano> onclick = foo(this);
[12:40:04] <ajpiano> function foo(elem) { $(elem).prev(); }
[12:40:22] <davemo> gross
[12:40:36] <webPragmatist> heh
[12:40:40] <ajpiano> when you're using inline event handlers
[12:40:50] <ajpiano> it's like choosing between diarrhea and vomit
[12:40:53] <davemo> he said inline js
[12:40:55] <jinxdone> multipass, wouldn't that be the same as document.location?
[12:40:55] <davemo> not inline event handlers
[12:41:04] <webPragmatist> indirectly it's an event handler heh
[12:41:07] <ajpiano> i assumed that's what he meant
[12:41:18] <davemo> gotcha webPragmatist
[12:41:23] <ajpiano> dropMAU5: ther'es a plugin
[12:41:30] <ajpiano> but nothing in core to do it in oen call
[12:41:35] <ajpiano> ?g jquery scrollTo
[12:41:36] <bot-t> ajpiano, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[12:41:45] <dropMAU5> yeah, was hoping not to use a plugin. i appreciate tho :)
[12:42:00] <ajpiano> cool i love arbitrary requirements
[12:42:03] <ajpiano> dropMAU5: you can do it yourself
[12:42:05] <ajpiano> by doing something like
[12:42:15] <webPragmatist> oh ya you are right
[12:42:19] <ajpiano> $(document).scrollTop( $("#something").offset().top );
[12:42:20] <webPragmatist> it's not an inline event handerâ€¦ sory
[12:42:36] <webPragmatist> you know whatâ€¦ i'm stupid
[12:42:41] <davemo> webPragmatist: you have <script> blocks inline in your .html or .php (or whatever), right?
[12:42:41] <webPragmatist> wait no i'm not
[12:42:47] <webPragmatist> ya
[12:42:49] <dropMAU5> ajpiano, i was misinformed about the scrollTop method- let me look into that. Thanks :)
[12:43:05] <davemo> webPragmatist: you want to access a particular node, right? in this case, an <ol>
[12:43:09] <webPragmatist> right
[12:43:10] <dropMAU5> i thougth it only returned the value
[12:43:19] <davemo> webPragmatist: do you have control of the markup? can you add an id?
[12:43:44] <webPragmatist> yea i suppose
[12:43:49] <davemo> put an id on the <ol>
[12:43:57] <davemo> in your script -> $('#the-id-you-added')
[12:44:01] <davemo> that gets you your <ol>
[12:44:11] <ajpiano> oh god he's doing *that*
[12:44:14] <webPragmatist> sad
[12:44:23] <davemo> what's sad? lol
[12:44:26] <webPragmatist> i dunno i just need to rethink this
[12:44:33] <davemo> you could also do $('ol')
[12:44:34] <ajpiano> webPragmatist: scripts don't have a mechanism for figuring out where in the DOM they are
[12:44:42] <davemo> which would give you a list of all the ols on the page
[12:45:11] <davemo> oh, it's source order dependent
[12:45:12] <davemo> gross
[12:45:31] <ajpiano> yea i guess its vom and poops
[12:45:33] <davemo> haha
[12:45:35] <davemo> truth
[12:49:08] <pootpoot> is there a way to cancel all current animations to do a special one if it needs to occur?
[12:49:35] <OnkelTem> I have two DIVs: first is hidden, second is displayed. I want to crossfade them now. How to do this?
[12:50:18] <pootpoot> OnkelTem jQuery('#first').fadeOut() ....... jQuery('#second').fadeIn()
[12:50:29] <davemo> OnkelTem: $(firstDiv).fadeOut(function() {$(secondDiv).fadeIn()}))
[12:50:38] <pootpoot> ya do that one
[12:50:40] <pootpoot> lol
[12:51:00] <ahandy> if i want a div to slide to the right using animate()'s +=250px, would i have to set the initial width to 0px so that it reaches 250px when done?
[12:51:14] <davemo> yup
[12:51:25] <ahandy> davemo: you're tlaking to me?
[12:51:28] <davemo> yup
[12:52:08] <ahandy> davemo: thing is, if i already have a div with width: 250px;, and then when i hid that one using -=250px, and then tried to show it again, the width would become 500px instead of 250
[12:52:16] <ahandy> since it'll be adding 250px to the already-there 250px;
[12:52:49] <davemo> why don't you just add classes that represent the states of your animation?
[12:53:03] <Duckpaste> ahandy: couldnt you hide it by saying with = 0?
[12:53:07] <ahandy> davemo: that wouldn't create the sliding to the right/left animation
[12:53:14] <davemo> .collapsed { width: 250px; } .expanded { width: 500px; }
[12:53:23] <OnkelTem> pootpoot: davemo: thank you! )
[12:53:36] <ahandy> Duckpaste: it would still double
[12:53:39] <davemo> .animate(function() { $(node).attr('class', 'expanded'); }, 500);
[12:53:56] <Spadeski> hello everyone
[12:54:02] <ahandy> davemo: lemme try that.
[12:54:27] <davemo> swapping classes for animations is so much easier than swapping numbers and manipulating css directly, imho
[12:54:37] <carrumba> can someone tell me why IE has problems with changing the size of a DIV element with css() and height()/width()?
[12:54:42] <Spadeski> ahandy came in and you already anwsered my question, congratz
[12:55:06] <ahandy> Spadeski: sorry?
[12:55:37] <Spadeski> with the additition to the 250px but I thought it was .=
[12:56:12] <pootpoot> does listening for div.mouseout() regard its children as well?
[12:56:25] <pootpoot> listen for mouseout() on its children
[12:56:53] <pickels> I have $('something').bind('mousewheel', function(){}); Now I've been reading that you need a plugin for mousewheel interaction but the event is firing even without the plugin. Was this added recently?
[12:57:16] <pickels> Or do some browser got a mousewheel event?
[12:57:59] <SinnerNyx> is there some way to have part of a div gradient faded? I want the left and right 30px of a particular div to fade to (0,0,0,0)
[12:58:18] <SinnerNyx> not as part of an animation but rather an ongoing effect
[12:58:19] <ahandy> davemo: that would make it disappear wont it?
[12:58:30] <ahandy> davemo: instead of sliding in to the left/right
[12:58:39] <Spadeski>  /join #web
[12:59:15] <davemo> ahandy: it would animate the property diffs between .collapsed and .expanded over 500ms
[12:59:32] <ahandy> davemo: im looking for a sliding effect.
[13:00:38] <Spadeski> do any of yall use jplayer ?
[13:00:48] <RichW> I want to run some JQuery code when the page loads, only if a url condition is met, like to run this: $('.comments').show(); maybe #comment or ?comment or something.
[13:00:50] <Elephant> jwplayer?
[13:00:54] <RichW> How can I do this?
[13:01:06] <davemo> Spadeski: yes, i'm using it in my current project
[13:01:09] <Spadeski> 'Elephant I tried that but dont you need too pay ?
[13:01:16] <Spadeski> davemo mind for a pm ?
[13:01:17] <davemo> oh wait, jwplayer is what i'm using, jplayer sucked :P
[13:01:24] <Elephant> I've used the free version for quite some time.
[13:01:31] <Spadeski> oh
[13:01:34] <Brodingo> RichW console.log(window.location);
[13:01:40] <Brodingo> find out what you want to test for
[13:01:43] <SinnerNyx> any ideas on how to gradient fade the edges of a div?
[13:01:47] <Spadeski> does it allow custom skinning with free version
[13:01:51] <Elephant> for non-comercial use I think it's free.
[13:02:10] <Elephant> I'm not sure, I apply colors to it, but I don't think I have an alternate theme
[13:02:26] <Elephant> I'm using an older version too.
[13:02:37] <Spadeski> oh ok ill check it out
[13:03:26] <OnkelTem> If I have two DIVs with same 'id', how would I address them?
[13:03:49] <necromancer> OnkelTem: change one of the IDs, you can't have 2 elements with the same id on the same page
[13:03:54] <Elephant> OnkelTem: afaik, you should not have two divs with the same ID.
[13:03:56] <necromancer> this goes for ajax-loaded content as well
[13:04:17] <OnkelTem> necromancer: yep, but how? :)
[13:04:29] <Elephant> the one referenced last will be the one selected eh?
[13:04:31] <OnkelTem> necromancer: you see, I already have two divs with same ir ))
[13:04:35] <necromancer> OnkelTem: so change them
[13:04:41] <necromancer> that's against the rules
[13:04:42] <Spadeski> OnkelTem id="id<?php echo '5'; ?>"
[13:04:47] <Spadeski> id5
[13:04:50] <necromancer> you simply can't do that and expect your shit to work
[13:05:03] <necromancer> Spadeski: that assumes he's using php
[13:05:03] <Spadeski> in jquery $(id+id_number)
[13:05:08] <RichW> Brodingo, I have to parse that url? sorry I am new to javascript.
[13:05:17] <Elephant> OnkelTem: perhaps you mean to use a "class>"
[13:05:24] <kinga> if i don't change the content-type to application/json will jquery.ajax() be able to identify it as a json string ?
[13:05:30] <OnkelTem> necromancer: I expected jQuery somehow allows to address in such cases anyway
[13:05:32] <Elephant> s/>/\?/
[13:05:39] <Spadeski> necromancer Well there is really no point to javascript or jquery for that matter without
[13:05:42] <necromancer> OnkelTem: what?
[13:05:47] <necromancer> Spadeski: that
[13:05:54] <JAAulde> mind is blanking...can I pass data to a UI widget's method? for example, open a dialog and pass it string "foo" - .dialog( 'open', 'foo' )
[13:05:58] <necromancer> Spadeski: that isn't true, and you can use python or ruby or even javascript for server-side code...
[13:06:02] <necromancer> or you don't even have to
[13:06:24] <Elephant> or lolcode
[13:06:37] <necromancer> kinga: depends on the browser. i'd serve the proper headers just to be safe.
[13:06:58] <OnkelTem> necromancer: techincally there are no limitations - if I can do $('.class').each() .. then why can't I do $('#id').each() ?
[13:07:00] <Brodingo> RichW window.location has a lot of information about the url, if you look at it in console youll see it has a lot of properties
[13:07:11] <Spadeski> necromancer really that I didnt know
[13:07:23] <Spadeski> python i thought was just for linux or something
[13:07:37] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: technically, there are limitations
[13:07:38] <Elephant> O_O
[13:07:39] <ajpiano> ?validid
[13:07:39] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[13:07:46] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4134
[13:07:51] <ajpiano> ?4134
[13:07:52] <bot-t> [#4134] Selectors with multiple identical id is not works (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/4134
[13:08:01] <Elephant> r/web_design
[13:08:01] <necromancer> OnkelTem: there are limitations, actually. please drop the arrogance and just listen to what i'm saying.
[13:08:05] <Elephant> LOL
[13:08:44] <necromancer> Spadeski: nah python can be used for web development with a number of frameworks, most notably django
[13:08:53] <OnkelTem> necromancer: jQuery could signal error, but it doesn't. Its strange
[13:09:08] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: jquery doesn't magically trigger errors for illogical conditions
[13:09:12] <necromancer> OnkelTem: it's not a jquery rule, it's a DOM rule
[13:09:24] <necromancer> it was assuming that you understood the difference between id & class
[13:09:39] <OnkelTem> necromancer: I know.
[13:09:47] <Elephant> apparently noty.
[13:09:50] <necromancer> the magic behind ids is since they're always unique, it's much faster to select elements with an id
[13:10:00] <necromancer> because the browser doesn't have to traverse the DOM, it just knows what element to grab
[13:10:25] <Spadeski> OnkelTTem the most your browser would be able to do is just get the last object with that 'id' and run the function on it but will not work for any before that
[13:10:32] <necromancer> with a class or attr selector or tag selector, it's gotta get every single occurrance of that element in the DOM. which means it has to check through the entire document
[13:10:40] <OnkelTem> So jQuery internally do something like getElementById, right?
[13:10:42] <necromancer> Spadeski: sometimes it gets the first one
[13:10:49] <ajpiano> yes, jQuery is doing exactly getElementById
[13:10:55] <ajpiano> it's so much like it that it is it
[13:10:59] <necromancer> OnkelTem: that's exactly what $('#id') does. getElementById and wraps in a DOM object
[13:11:00] <necromancer> :)
[13:11:02] <Spadeski> tomato tomato
[13:11:08] <Spadeski> lol
[13:11:08] <OnkelTem> necromancer: ok :)
[13:11:08] <davemo> wraps it in a jQuery object*
[13:11:22] <necromancer> yeah jq object sorry :)
[13:11:31] <JAAulde> clarification, I know I can pass arguments to UI dialog methods, but can I pass them tot he open method of dialog?
[13:12:24] <Laire_> When I use replaceWith, it replace the complet node, how can I replace only the conten from the node?
[13:12:30] <ajpiano> Laire_: .html()
[13:12:32] <JAAulde> n/m, I keep forgetting that the open event is not the open method
[13:12:49] <OnkelTem> I see. So its up to browser to decide how to treat such invalid cases. But the result is unpredictable.
[13:12:50] <Spadeski> Whats the meaning of the non-commercial licenwse?
[13:12:54] <necromancer> yup
[13:12:59] <Spadeski> license *
[13:13:23] <ajpiano> OnkelTem: that's a compelling reason to not have dupliated IDs in your stuff, isn't it
[13:13:25] <necromancer> RichW: the way i usually parse URL strings is with 3 arrays: you split it by "?" and then split it again by "&", and then you split those arrays by "=" to find the key/value pairs. if there are a number of variables in the URL i usually create a 4th array that maps to those key/value pairs so it's easy to reference urlGetParameters['yourvar'] or whatever
[13:13:57] <necromancer> RichW: i usually conform to this guide when i write URLs for JS accessibility http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[13:14:01] <OnkelTem> ajpiano: indeed :)
[13:14:02] <Spadeski> Whos the one that first said Jqplayer?
[13:14:07] <necromancer> this allows your application to be crawlable if necessary
[13:14:07] <Spadeski> Jwplayer
[13:14:41] <Spadeski> Thank you Elephant Jqplayer made my month
[13:14:42] <Spadeski> lol
[13:14:47] <Spadeski> jq
[13:14:49] <jeremysimmons> hi all
[13:14:53] <Spadeski> eh w/e
[13:14:54] <Elephant> jwplayer?
[13:14:59] <Elephant> yeah hehe.
[13:15:14] <Elephant> It's quite nice, probably why so many pages use it.
[13:15:18] <jeremysimmons> does anyone have a minute to answer a question about chaining $.load
[13:15:22] <Elephant> very simple and lightweight imho.
[13:15:24] <RichW> necromancer, after alot of tinkering, i found window.location.hash, seems to do the trick
[13:15:36] <pachet> ?promise @ jeremysimmons
[13:15:37] <bot-t> jeremysimmons, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[13:16:14] <jeremysimmons> thanks @pachet and @bot-t, I'll look into $.promise before I ask further
[13:16:24] <Elephant> lol
[13:16:28] <Elephant> thank you robot
[13:16:29] <necromancer> RichW: what browser(s) are you developing for? iirc that doesn't behave as expected on IE 7 and below
[13:16:34] <ccmonster> what are you doing RichW ?
[13:16:35] <pachet> ?bot-t
[13:16:35] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[13:16:42] <ccmonster> lol pachet
[13:16:43] <Elephant> lies!
[13:16:51] <OnkelTem> When a browser actually renders data (which could be time consuming procedure) - right after I modify DOM tree or when a subtree becomse displayed?
[13:17:21] <Spadeski> Elephant yeah also comes with a customizer
[13:17:32] <Spadeski> which is sweet cuz im not into that image editing shit
[13:17:37] <jeremysimmons> pachet - can you recommend a more updated resource than visualjquery.com that has a simliar interface?
[13:17:54] <RichW> necromancer, I usually test on firefox first.
[13:18:00] <ajpiano> jeremysimmons: http://jqapi.com
[13:18:12] <Elephant> Yeah, and it has quite an awesome javascript API
[13:18:18] <Elephant> very easy to deal with.
[13:18:19] <RichW> ccmonster, showing a hidden comments div tag if a url condition is met
[13:18:37] <necromancer> RichW: IE has most of the market share in terms of browsers still
[13:18:44] <ajpiano> oh boy here we go
[13:18:45] <jeremysimmons> thx ajpiano, that's delicious
[13:18:46] <necromancer> RichW: if you don't have any problems go for it :)
[13:18:57] <necromancer> much easier than making 4 fucking arrays
[13:18:59] <pachet> jeremysimmons: er...probably not with that interface, no :(
[13:19:42] <Elephant> wind0z
[13:19:45] <Elephant> <3
[13:20:55] <OnkelTem> I want to get smooth effect of changing pages on a website: I have current page visualized, and the new page in a variable.
[13:21:18] <ccmonster> did you figure it out RichW ?
[13:21:24] <OnkelTem> Is there a way to place new content with some effect like crossfade?
[13:22:22] <ccmonster> fadeOut(400,function(e){$(this).fadeOut(400)})
[13:22:28] <ccmonster> or something to that effect OnkelTem
[13:22:48] <ccmonster> woops, second one should be fadeIn(400)
[13:22:57] <Cryp71c> Is there an easy way to check for any outstanding posts (ajax calls) that are still pending, either through raw javascript or through jQuery
[13:23:20] <OnkelTem> ccmonster: where in this sequence I replace content with new one?
[13:23:47] <pachet> in the callback before the fadein
[13:23:55] <davemo> $('content1').fadeOut(function() { $(this).replaceWith('content2'); }, 400);
[13:24:04] <ccmonster> bingo
[13:24:19] <OnkelTem> yees
[13:24:30] <Spadeski> Elephant say I wanted to change the song of this player and refresh it without refreshin the page is that included with this do you know ?
[13:24:58] <ccmonster> or, $('#myDiv').fadeOut(400).empty().append(newDiv).fadeIn(400); although that could be 'jumpy'
[13:25:44] <Elephant> Spadeski: I do this two ways actually heh, one way [sloppy] is to just re call swfObject() via ajax or whatnot.
[13:25:56] <Spadeski> another ?
[13:25:57] <Elephant> but the elegant way is to create an object for you jwplayer
[13:26:03] <Elephant> and call .load() on it.
[13:26:11] <Elephant> the api docs will explain how.
[13:26:28] <Spadeski> ah ok just wanted to make sure it is included :D
[13:26:30] <Elephant> s/you/your/
[13:26:40] <OnkelTem> ccmonster: I see. But for crossfade I should have both divs rendered, right?
[13:26:44] <Elephant> alright, have fun.
[13:26:49] <Elephant> ta ta for now!
[13:29:15] <ccmonster> ah, crossfade.
[13:30:02] <ccmonster> OnkelTem, http://martin-fleming.co.uk/2011/02/crossfading-block-level-elements-with-jquery/
[13:30:44] <ccmonster> OnkelTem, or this - which looks even simpler/easier - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7073118/jquery-element-cross-fade-plugin
[13:31:40] <OnkelTem> ccmonster: thank you
[13:33:44] <Spadeski> im so fin happy right now
[13:35:08] <sphinxxx> how do you select the last h2 in a certain div?
[13:35:20] <webPragmatist> what's the noconflict equivalent to $$
[13:36:15] <Brodingo> sphinxxx ?last
[13:36:21] <Brodingo> ugh
[13:36:23] <Brodingo> ?last
[13:36:23] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[13:43:53] <Spadeski> Ok any reason why i get the jqplayer and it shows all black and unusable
[13:43:54] <Spadeski> ?
[13:43:58] <Spadeski> jwplayer
[13:46:54] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Spadeski
[13:46:55] <bot-t> Spadeski, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:47:14] <Spadeski> ok
[13:47:30] <Elephant> haqed
[13:47:43] <Elephant> haqer
[13:48:07] <deadlyicon> jQuery doesnt run animations when a page isn't visible (in browsers that support it). This is a recent optimization. Does anyone know if it is possible to tell jQuery to run post animation callbacks event when the animation isnt being run?
[13:49:37] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.138/Jwplayer/  Just goto this page and it will remake the jplayer as a black non-usable object
[13:52:14] <ravenzz> mh?
[13:52:23] <ravenzz> I see 2 players
[13:53:19] <sadmicrowave> hi guys, can I get some help with returning variables to a function call? My alert() is giving 'undefined' when returning true or false - http://pastebin.com/vDNtDBnU
[13:53:52] <dethkrieg> jquery selectors question: if i want to find an an input by both 'name' and 'value' how would i do that? I know how to get just the name: $("input[name='myName']) so what if i wanted #("input[name='myName' value='myValue'])
[13:54:26] <sadmicrowave> dethkrieg, $("input[name='myName'][value='myValue']")
[13:54:31] <dethkrieg> there it is
[13:54:32] <dethkrieg> thanks
[13:54:44] <dethkrieg> i have one other question
[13:54:55] <ravenzz> dethkrieg also there is a missing semicolon at line 7
[13:55:18] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, you mean sadmicrowave?
[13:55:22] <sadmicrowave> I see that now, thanks
[13:55:39] <ravenzz> oh yes
[13:55:41] <ravenzz> sorry
[13:55:53] <dethkrieg> a lot of times you define things with what i refer to as "key/value" pairs. So for like $("#myID").css({'background-color':'red','color':'green'});
[13:56:03] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, still returning 'undefined' however
[13:56:04] <dethkrieg> the stuff in the { key : value, key :value }
[13:56:08] <dethkrieg> what do you call taht set?
[13:56:09] <Spadeski>  Bakc
[13:56:28] <sadmicrowave> dethkrieg, an object?
[13:56:29] <Spadeski> ravenzz your right
[13:56:32] <Spadeski> hmmm
[13:56:49] <Elephant> you're
[13:57:01] <Spadeski> thank you
[13:57:04] <sadmicrowave> Elephant, lol
[13:57:47] <dethkrieg> sadmicrowave, maybe, im not sure
[13:57:47] <Elephant> yeah sorry
[13:57:49] <ravenzz> sadmicrowave: error      : function(oD,oT,oE){ console.debug( oD+'\n'+oT+'\n'+oE ) },
[13:58:22] <Elephant> is it just me or does console.* mess up ff3.6?
[13:58:23] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, you don't have 'procedures.php' so I'm betting it would fail for you...
[13:58:31] <sadmicrowave> Elephant, it does
[13:58:32] <ravenzz> sure
[13:58:35] <Elephant> without firebug
[13:58:57] <Elephant> yeah, switched from alert(), at least I don't forget to leave alerts() in
[13:59:00] <Elephant> :/
[13:59:12] <dethkrieg> sadmicrowave, you are right, that shit is called an object
[13:59:18] <sadmicrowave> :)
[13:59:26] <Elephant> I should probably do something better though.
[13:59:28] <dethkrieg> sadmicrowave, on the Jquery API they refer to it as a cssObj when they code it like that
[13:59:44] <sadmicrowave> dethkrieg, while I posed that as a question...it was intended to be more rhetorical than anything...
[13:59:45] <dethkrieg> sadmicrowave, i learned Jquery without really learning Javascript lol
[14:00:23] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, man, this is pissing me off....
[14:00:26] <dethkrieg> sadmicrowave, just verifitying incase anyone else was asking
[14:00:36] <pachet> i learned javascript without learning jquery
[14:00:38] <sadmicrowave> thats always good
[14:00:40] <pachet> how's the grass on that side
[14:00:42] <sadmicrowave> lol
[14:00:53] <sadmicrowave> probably pretty damn green
[14:02:06] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, if you want to replicate the script without the ajax just set var cType = 'MODULE' in the DoSerialVerification() function and comment out the rest (I should have done that in my bin - sorry)
[14:06:29] <matthPHP> How can i get a json file into a HTML document without a web server?
[14:08:39] <sadmicrowave> ravenzz, it has to do with the fSuccess = function(){...} that I've got going on.... take that out and it works fine...
[14:17:35] <sphinxxx> how do you find the last in the array, like .eq(0) would be first
[14:17:45] <sphinxxx> assumign you don't know the number of the last array
[14:19:29] <sadmicrowave> sphinxxx, var cnt = myarray.length; .....eq(cnt);
[14:20:16] <usurer> (not exactly jquery specific, but I figure since a lot of you guys are also javascript experts) Is there a way to send a message from one browser window to another, when both are on the same computer, same browser, same origin etc?
[14:20:22] <matthPHP> Any ideas?
[14:20:23] <matthPHP> How can i get a json file into a HTML document without a web server?
[14:20:41] <usurer> sort of like the Window.postMessage API, except sending to arbitrary number of windows which might be open
[14:20:50] <usurer> of the same exact page
[14:26:13] <meola> Anyone here good with regex?
[14:27:26] <sadmicrowave> ?ask @ meola
[14:27:26] <bot-t> meola, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:27:39] <gkatsev> there is also #regex
[14:28:23] <sadmicrowave> great place for testing regex: http://www.gskinner.com/RegExr/
[14:29:24] <kinga> sadmicrowave, that's a very useful website, thanks :D
[14:29:30] <sadmicrowave> :)
[14:30:09] <meola> trying to replace the following: <p>(Source: <a href="something" title="somename">somename</a>)</p> with <img src="somepic"/><p><a href="something" title="somename">somename</a>
[14:30:17] <meola> from the pure html
[14:30:46] <sadmicrowave> why do you need regex?
[14:31:20] <meola> was guessing it was the easiest way, since the href, title and "somename" can be anything
[14:32:04] <meola> sadmicrowave: thanks for that site, bookmarked!
[14:32:16] <sadmicrowave> I'm working on your issue
[14:33:01] <matyus> does anyone have experience with using ajax on the iPad in airplane mode?
[14:34:39] <sabotage> well, having tried asking this on #jquery-ui and #jquerymoble with no replies, can anyone at least give me the lowdown on dragging into nested sortables in jquery-ui?
[14:35:18] <sabotage> I can't seem to get the .sortable('cancel') to do anything, and ui.sender is undefined
[14:36:00] <sadmicrowave> meola, so you don't really need to replace anything...just add <img src='somepic'> to the beginning, before the <p>
[14:36:02] <sadmicrowave> ??
[14:36:14] <fructose> I'm trying to find a way to match an element id using a pattern. Is there a more scrutinizing method than [id*="string"]?
[14:36:23] <meola> and remove the (Source: and ) before/after the link
[14:36:27] <Spadeski> Elephant way to disable menu button and share buttons that come up ?
[14:36:27] <sadmicrowave> yea
[14:36:28] <sadmicrowave> ok
[14:36:44] <sabotage> and I see the beforeStop, receive, update and stop all firing on the sortable I'm trying to cancel on, just can't get it to actually cancel!
[14:39:01] <fructose> I'd like to match something like id="Username_1234" from the string "Username" without matching id="name_1234"
[14:40:44] <aTm2011> anyone want to point me to a good book on Jquery if i have had no previous experience with javascript, but have taken programming courses in python and java
[14:40:53] <ajpiano> aTm2011: see ?101
[14:40:53] <bot-t> aTm2011, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[14:40:57] <ajpiano> ?jqf
[14:40:57] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:41:15] <Ox41> How can I POST to a different domain? just open a window with the POSTed page?
[14:41:36] <ajpiano> fructose: you can do .filter(function() { return /regex/.match($(this).text()); }) kinda thig if you want
[14:42:50] <fructose> ajpiano: I'll try that, thanks
[14:48:43] <sadmicrowave> meola, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/rCqZV/1/
[14:48:53] <sadmicrowave> sorry for the delay, got tied up with some work stuff
[14:49:40] <meola> sadmicrowave: no problem, thanks for helping!
[14:49:49] <sadmicrowave> is that what you wanted?
[14:51:17] <dynedain> I'm using JQueryUI on a site with JQuery 1.3.2. According to the JQUeryUI site, both versions work on 1.3.2, but whenever I try to use 1.9 to create tabs, I get an error "cannot read property jQuery1316123060198 of undefined"â€¦. thoughts?
[14:51:28] <ajpiano> lawl
[14:51:37] <ajpiano> 1.9 and 1.3.2 def won't mix
[14:51:47] <ajpiano> 1.3.2 only works with ui 1.7.x
[14:51:53] <laks> Hi, anyone available to help me troubleshoot a cross browser issue?
[14:52:52] <dynedain> sorryâ€¦ 1.8.16, not 1.9â€¦. the download page claimes 1.8.16 works:  http://jqueryui.com/download
[14:53:17] <ajpiano> dynedain: that thing there is accidentally ambiguous
[14:53:25] <ajpiano> it means to say "anything above jquery 1.3.2"
[14:53:29] <ajpiano> not jQuery 1.3.2 and above
[14:53:30] <ajpiano> :/
[14:53:47] <laks> I have a selector that works fine in firefox, but returns no elements in chrome - anyone have any ideas?
[14:54:03] <ajpiano> laks: ?demo
[14:54:07] <ajpiano> see ?demo
[14:54:08] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:54:11] <sadmicrowave> I love accidental ambiguity
[14:54:18] <dynedain> greatâ€¦. that sucks. Need a feature from 1.8.16, but stuck with 1.3.2 because of Drupal 6
[14:54:27] <sadmicrowave> ^^just the phrase - not the concept
[14:54:28] <ajpiano> drupal is a ghettoooooooooooo
[14:55:20] <laks> ya, this is unfortunately on an isolated server =( It's a very simple selector however
[14:55:37] <laks> basically $("#someId a")
[14:55:37] <Clex> Is there a way to increase/decrease a text input form elem like this http://i.imgur.com/Ybwft.gif with jQuery or something?
[14:56:28] <ajpiano> Clex: there is a "spinner" widget in jquery ui 1.9 (which is not yet released)
[14:57:14] <ajpiano> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/currency.html
[14:57:34] <Clex> Sweet. Thanks a lot ajpiano.
[14:57:36] <meola> sadmicrowave: yeah, mostly, just wondering how it would tackle if the original text had more than one link
[14:57:47] <laks> both that and $(#someID).find("a") work on firefox, but are returning empty on chrome
[14:58:10] <meola> it should always leave the last one and remove everything else
[14:58:36] <ajpiano> Clex: even if you don't end being able to use that, at least you can know the name for the control :)
[14:58:41] <ajpiano> it's called a stepper or a spinner
[14:59:53] <Clex> Yeah ajpiano, thanks. But I think I'll go with the jQuery UI one.
[15:00:03] <sadmicrowave> meola, ok hold on
[15:00:03] <ajpiano> cool
[15:00:24] <ajpiano> Clex: just be advised it's in 1.9 which is not publically release yet
[15:01:14] <Clex> I'm far away from releasing anything so that's cool, don't worry.
[15:02:49] <sadmicrowave> meola,
[15:02:52] <sadmicrowave> http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/rCqZV/2/
[15:03:52] <meola> sadmicrowave: that will just save the link tag multiple times, and just the last one remains ye?
[15:03:56] <ajpiano> Clex: in that case, you'll probably find http://bit.ly/jquigitjs http://bit.ly/jquigitcss very useful
[15:04:01] <meola> on the $a var
[15:04:06] <ajpiano> thats the latest edge build of jqueryui with the base css
[15:05:06] <sadmicrowave> meola, no, hover over each link and check the browser status bar, they hrefs change, I'm sure there is some way to put "<br>"'s between each <a> in the append instead of making the css width:100% but I'm not sure and can't put anymore time into it
[15:05:49] <alex7> I have some elements marked as draggable in the code I'm working with, but even after I remove the code they are still draggable
[15:05:55] <meola> sadmicrowave: I'll try it out and work with that, thanks alot
[15:06:35] <sadmicrowave> meola, np, $('a') is getting all instances of <a> in the document... basically making $a an array containing all the instances...
[15:06:35] <alex7> I'm basically not able to find out exactly where all the elements are defined in the js, so I'm doing it step by step
[15:07:02] <sadmicrowave> meola, once you know that, the rest is downhill, you can loop through the array with an .each() or whatever you want to do to act upon each <a> individually
[15:07:15] <meola> sadmicrowave: ah yes, I see that now
[15:07:45] <sadmicrowave> later guys
[15:13:29] <Ox41> Im trying to POST to a different domain, and im having problems...I think it might be beacuse of the xhr
[15:13:46] <Ox41> is there a way to POST a form as if it were a form element?
[15:18:26] <laks> anyone familiar with jsTree?
[15:26:57] <jaequery> is there any way to do .......... function cat extends animal(){ }
[15:27:47] <sparuvu> use prototype feature of javascript object
[15:28:32] <sparuvu> http://helephant.com/2009/01/18/javascript-object-prototype/
[15:29:00] <Crell> Hi folks.  Hopefully simple question.  I have a jq object, an A tag specifically, on which I've attached event handlers.  I want to now turn that tag into a string to stick it into HTML elsewhere.  What's the right way to do that?  (.html() only gets me the contents of the element).
[15:29:22] <ajpiano> Crell: don't "turn it into a string"
[15:29:44] <ajpiano> Crell: you can either move it by doing $("#whatever").appendTo("#whereverElse")
[15:29:56] <ajpiano> or .clone().appendTo("whereverElse")
[15:32:09] <Crell> Hrm.
[15:32:13] <jaequery> whats the difference from doing,   cat.prototype = { eat: function(){} };   and cat.eat = function(){ };
[15:41:48] <damion_> holy hell thats alot of people
[15:42:01] <damion_> can anyone answer a few questions for me?
[15:42:58] <damion_> 839 members that are all keeping to themselves?!
[15:43:24] <kadoban> "can i ask a question" is a really bad question.  just ask what you really want
[15:43:52] <damion_> okay
[15:44:06] <damion_> so i create an element: $('<span>');
[15:44:13] <damion_> what does that give me?
[15:44:24] <damion_> say i do var el = $('<span>');
[15:44:32] <damion_> when i console.log( el );
[15:44:40] <damion_> it gives me an array with the element inside it
[15:44:48] <damion_> i think
[15:46:00] <damion_> im just trying to wrap my head around what im working with
[15:49:14] <damion_> anyone?
[15:49:27] <ajpiano> it gives you a jquery object
[15:49:30] <ajpiano> like any other jquery object
[15:49:47] <ajpiano> $("#something") - get an element by id and have a jquery object
[15:49:50] <damion_> why doesn't it show up as an object in the console?
[15:50:05] <ajpiano> $("<span>") - create a span and hav ea jquery object
[15:50:15] <ajpiano> because a jquery object is like an array on roids, kinda
[15:50:23] <ajpiano> so it prints as an array in some dev tools by default
[15:50:32] <damion_> its the chrome dev tools
[15:50:48] <damion_> how can i see into the object?
[15:50:52] <r1ch> hey guys, got an issue with query ui dialog between browsers if someone has a minute to have a quick look: http://jsfiddle.net/GgYTK/
[15:50:54] <damion_> i want to see all the methods and properties
[15:51:25] <ajpiano> console.dir, damion_
[15:51:45] <r1ch> only the far right button should be focused however in firefox both the far left and far right button are focused
[15:51:49] <damion_> im about to learn something new...
[15:52:25] <damion_> there she blows
[15:53:45] <damion_> ajpiano: how would i get that in a script? var el = $('<span>'); then what?
[15:53:53] <ajpiano> wat
[15:53:58] <damion_> for use in the script i mean
[15:54:14] <ajpiano> $("<span>").appendTo(document.body);
[15:54:21] <damion_> sorry
[15:54:28] <damion_> i didnt explain that well
[15:54:39] <damion_> when i do console.dir(), i see everything inside the object
[15:54:40] <ajpiano> var el = $("<span>"); el.doSomething().doSomethingElse();
[15:54:40] <ajpiano> etc
[15:54:50] <damion_> eh
[15:54:56] <ajpiano> have you like
[15:55:02] <ajpiano> written any jquery before, ever
[15:55:11] <damion_> yep
[15:55:18] <ajpiano> so then what is the question
[15:55:29] <ajpiano> you have a span in a jquery object, do with it what you will
[15:55:58] <damion_> why does it show up as an array when logged?
[15:56:05] <ajpiano> because it's like an array
[15:56:05] <Eviltwin> Because it is arrayish
[15:56:08] <ajpiano> what difference does it make
[15:56:15] <ajpiano> it's a "jQuery Object"
[15:56:29] <damion_> right. everything in javascript is an array.
[15:56:31] <damion_> er
[15:56:32] <damion_> object
[15:56:34] <damion_> but still
[15:56:39] <ajpiano> yes but jQuery Object is a specific thing
[15:56:49] <damion_> im curious as to why its 'cloaked' or whatever
[15:56:55] <ajpiano> which is like, this array of dom elements extended with methods
[15:57:00] <Eviltwin> It's not cloaked
[15:57:09] <damion_> one sec
[15:57:18] <mikedoty> cloak
[15:57:19] <Eviltwin> A lot of the consoles assume any object that has a .length and a .slice are arrays
[15:57:20] <ajpiano> go ask DCT
[15:57:25] <ajpiano> CDT ^^
[15:57:27] <ajpiano> yea
[15:58:00] <damion_> ah
[15:58:03] <damion_> so thats why?
[15:58:08] <Eviltwin> Why is what?
[15:58:18] <damion_> length and slice properties
[15:58:31] <Eviltwin> Again, why what?
[15:58:35] <Eviltwin> Why does the jQuery object have that?
[15:58:41] <Eviltwin> Why does it assume those are arrays
[15:58:42] <Eviltwin> ?
[15:59:00] <Ox41> can I set a form submit referrer in jquery?
[15:59:18] <Eviltwin> Ox41: Set the Referrer header with the request?
[15:59:27] <snover> no, setting referer manually is not allowed in xhr spec.
[15:59:34] <ajpiano> i don't think it's as simple as that, if you do console.log({length: 5, slice: function() {}})
[15:59:50] <ajpiano> it doesn't log an array
[15:59:53] <ajpiano> there's probably other things
[15:59:55] <Eviltwin> splice, not slice
[15:59:56] <Eviltwin> I lied
[16:00:06] <ajpiano> true story,
[16:00:15] <ajpiano> logs an array with console.log({length: 5, splice: function() {}})
[16:00:21] <Eviltwin> I know it does
[16:00:58] <damion_> okay. heres a better question. why can't i access the options object using select.options after creating a select: var select = $('<select>'); select.options[1] = new Option( asd,asd );
[16:01:06] <ajpiano> lawl
[16:01:15] <Eviltwin> Uh.....
[16:01:18] <Eviltwin> WTF?!?!?!?
[16:01:22] <ajpiano> because a jQuery object is like an array of dom elements
[16:01:33] <ajpiano> so if you want the actual select itself
[16:01:44] <ajpiano> you have to do var select = $("<select>")[0]
[16:01:51] <damion_> nice
[16:01:57] <ajpiano> but... that's not really how you'd go about adding options to a select with jquery
[16:02:01] <damion_> right i know
[16:02:02] <ajpiano> cause you can like...well... not use new Option
[16:02:17] <damion_> thats the raw javascript way of adding options
[16:02:23] <ajpiano> i'm aware of that
[16:02:28] <damion_> you'd just append an option element in jquery
[16:02:30] <damion_> right?
[16:02:31] <oojacoboo> is there a flash() or something built into the jquery api?
[16:02:37] <ajpiano> yeep
[16:02:39] <oojacoboo> something that will flash a message?
[16:03:06] <oojacoboo> or do you have to do a fadeIn() fadeOut() manually?
[16:03:39] <ajpiano> the latter
[16:03:50] <oojacoboo> awesome
[16:03:55] <oojacoboo>                     $("#demo-request-error").text(data).fadeIn(500).fadeOut(500).fadeIn(500);
[16:03:55] <damion_> totally
[16:04:00] <oojacoboo> I guess like that?
[16:04:28] <Eviltwin> $("<select>").append($("<option>").text("Apple").val("apple"));
[16:04:54] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: 1.5 seconds for a flash?
[16:05:22] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I didn't say the delays we're good :P
[16:05:28] <oojacoboo> I'll have to tweak that
[16:05:37] <oojacoboo> maybe 1000 each would be better
[16:06:10] <ajpiano> lol, like 250 each at most
[16:06:17] <ajpiano> the flash is called the flash
[16:06:19] <ajpiano> because he's really fast
[16:06:23] <Eviltwin> I'd say like 150 ma
[16:06:24] <Eviltwin> x
[16:06:25] <ajpiano> not because he slowly jogs to fight the enemies
[16:09:19] <oojacoboo> 300 looks perfect
[16:14:54] <oojacoboo> what would cause a div that's slideDown to start from the top right corner and increase in size?
[16:15:02] <oojacoboo> instead of starting full width
[16:19:32] <scorphus> oojacoboo: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:20:09] <oojacoboo> scorphus: you are recommending using this api function instead?
[16:20:41] <oojacoboo> is this to replace the others?  Them being deprecated functions?
[16:21:45] <damion_> thanks for the insight lads
[16:21:48] <damion_> good luck to you all
[16:22:25] <scorphus> oojacoboo: well, no, not at all. Animate is useful when the other functions won't do what you want
[16:22:38] <oojacoboo> I got ya
[16:22:50] <oojacoboo> i think slideDown will work, I guess I am doing something else wrong
[16:37:44] <tyfighter> hi - is there a way to disable dynamic form layout in jQuery Mobile?
[16:44:41] <ProLoser|Work> do you have to do JSON.stringify() before using ajax?
[16:45:56] <lastent> Hi, is there any way to make a selector that is the combination of two selectors, but the element has to have the two conditions to be selected?
[16:47:32] <ajpiano> you mean "the way every selector works by default"
[16:47:34] <ajpiano> ?
[16:47:40] <coldhead> $('selector1').filter('selector2')
[16:47:50] <ajpiano> $("div.foo") it matches the condition that it's a div and that it has class foo
[16:48:20] <ajpiano> $("#foo.bar.baz[name='hi']"); makes sure it is id foo class bar and baz and name attribute bar
[16:48:21] <ajpiano> etc.
[16:51:49] <ProLoser|Work> hallo ajpiano
[16:52:08] <ProLoser|Work> does anyone know if you have to do JSON.stringify() before using ajax?
[16:52:17] <ajpiano> it depends what you're trying to send
[16:52:22] <ajpiano> and what your backend is expecting
[16:52:31] <lastent> ajpiano, and what about that it is the class bar and the input value is "first"?
[16:52:34] <ajpiano> if it's a simple get or post with non-nested anything, typically not
[16:52:41] <ProLoser|Work> doesn't backend usually just expect post data and $.ajax converts it?
[16:52:50] <ajpiano> $("input.bar[value='first']")
[16:53:13] <ajpiano> who knows
[16:53:18] <ajpiano> typically you don't have to stringify first
[16:53:33] <ajpiano> unless you know that a particular service is expecting stringified JSON
[16:53:39] <ProLoser|Work> does stringify turn the whole JSON into 1 string, or just the nested ones?
[16:53:45] <ajpiano> wat
[16:53:54] <ajpiano> it doesn't turn JSON into anything
[16:54:03] <lastent> thanks ajpiano
[16:54:04] <ajpiano> it serializes the entire object or array to a single string
[16:54:05] <ProLoser|Work> i thought it flattens it into a string?
[16:54:17] <ajpiano> it does, but JSON is that string... not the object that came from it
[16:54:22] <ajpiano> that generated it*
[16:54:31] <ProLoser|Work> so is it ever unsafe to stringify?
[16:55:07] <ajpiano> if the backend isn't expecting stringified json it probably ... won't work
[16:55:41] <ajpiano> in the sense that no one ever dies from webapps erroring out,  it's "safe"
[16:56:04] <ProLoser|Work> hah
[16:56:19] <ProLoser|Work> no people running and screaming in all directions with the building on fire, eh?
[16:57:23] <ajpiano> GET OUT NOW, SAVE YOURSELF, SOMEONE PASSED SOME CRAPPY FORM INPUT
[16:58:23] * gnarf is pretty happy with this function: https://gist.github.com/1220819
[16:59:04] <gnarf> can even expand "10px 100px" into top/bottom 10px and left/right 100px
[17:05:51] <brianpWins> if I pass $.each a json object. how can I get an accurate count as to how many fields there are in that object?
[17:10:18] <Kamakazi> brian: you should jsut be able to do a .length on the object
[17:11:21] <oojacoboo> is there something likeâ€¦ .css(clear);
[17:11:44] <oojacoboo> or would you just leave that function without any properties,values
[17:26:00] <BlackFate> hello! i got a div class=songlist and inside i generate with php many divs with class="song## songlist". I tried to use $(function(){ $(".playlist > .songlist").hide(); }); to hide it but with no luck. any suggestions?
[17:26:17] <BlackFate> soz.. correction
[17:26:23] <BlackFate> hello! i got a div class=playlist and inside i generate with php many divs with class="song## songlist". I tried to use $(function(){ $(".playlist > .songlist").hide(); }); to hide it but with no luck. any suggestions?
[17:31:29] <oojacoboo> how can you clear everything in the style="" for an element?
[17:31:43] <oojacoboo> without defining the properties to null out?
[17:32:44] <Spadeski> #().style='';
[17:32:46] <Spadeski> ?
[17:32:49] <oojacoboo> removeAttr("style")
[17:32:50] <oojacoboo> ;)
[17:33:03] <Spadeski> oh nice
[17:33:32] <oojacoboo> yea, just found that, pretty bingo
[17:34:18] <oojacoboo> although, I thinkâ€¦. .css() should null it out
[17:34:20] <oojacoboo> personally
[17:34:36] <oojacoboo> but removing the html attribute is even better
[17:40:37] <acalbaza> what is the proper way to access plugin's.data from within a private function?  i cant access $(this).data('foo') from within a private method.
[17:52:39] <aibo> hi
[17:52:40] <aibo> $($(this).text().append("-nav")).show();
[17:52:43] <aibo> whats wrong?
[17:53:03] <ajpiano> so much
[17:53:10] <aibo> :)
[17:53:20] <ajpiano> are you trying to use jquery's append method to concatenate text
[17:53:25] <ajpiano> together???
[17:53:53] <ajpiano> .text().append("-nav") wat??
[17:53:58] <aibo> sorry
[17:54:02] <aibo> $("#"+$(this).text().append("-nav")).show();
[17:54:14] <ajpiano> same problem...
[17:54:20] <IT-Duck> How can I initiate this: https://gist.github.com/1148727/15e096c3ee084c2166961dab9f53472cb0340a0c
[17:54:30] <aibo> <a href="bla.html">test</a> should show the element with id "#test-nav"
[17:54:31] <ajpiano> you can't call .append() on what .text() returns
[17:54:55] <ajpiano> lawl
[17:55:11] <ajpiano> $("#"+$(this).text() + "-nav").show();
[17:55:21] <ajpiano> text returns a string, you ... do string things to it
[17:55:53] <ajpiano> IT-Duck: $("#someElement").scoreboar();
[17:55:59] <ajpiano> IT-Duck: $("#someElement").scoreboard();
[17:58:11] <aibo> ajpiano: how can i connect strings in jquery? in php it's just a . "foo".$bar
[17:58:21] <ajpiano> ...
[17:58:25] <aibo> $("#".$(this).text()."-nav").show(); but that's just wrong
[17:58:31] <ajpiano> the fact that you are asking me is mind blowing me
[17:58:40] <damjan> +
[17:58:47] <ajpiano> you had a + in your initial example...
[17:59:03] <ajpiano> but also tried to use append at the same time
[17:59:44] <aibo> i asked because i also tried this: $("#"+$(this).text()+"-nav").show();
[17:59:56] <ajpiano> that should work fine
[18:00:02] <ajpiano> test if your selector is matching elements
[18:00:13] <ajpiano> console.log($("#whatever").length)
[18:01:54] <aibo> maches :(
[18:01:58] <aibo> matches
[18:02:59] <aibo> but doesn't work aswell
[18:03:35] <ajpiano> ...
[18:03:39] <aibo472> gah.
[18:05:51] <aibo472> i don't get it... the log shows exactly what i need
[18:08:03] <aibo472> $("#" + $(this).text() + "-nav").css("background","red"); doesn't work either
[18:09:24] <ajpiano> is it happening when the document is ready?
[18:09:32] <aibo472> yep
[18:09:51] <damjan> are you sure $(this) is correct where you call that?
[18:10:00] <aibo472> yes
[18:10:18] <aibo472> the log just shows the exact thing i want
[18:10:55] <damjan> what exactly did you log?
[18:11:39] <aibo472> mhm, the log shows #test-nav that would result in $(#test-nav) but it needs to be $("#test-nav") buuut $("'#" + $(this).text() + "-nav'").css("background","red");  doesn't work eiiiither
[18:12:29] <v0lksman> anyone happen to know of a menu plugin that floats a rectangular box behind text on hover?  (I know lame way to ask but I know I've seen it) http://imgur.com/e28xM <- bare menu style

[18:20:57] <ronxyz> Hello. I am working on a page under ssl and I am trying to get rid of "displaying insecure content warnings". I am trying to replace all the "http" images in an html string (variable called 'htmlstring')  to "https". I want to use jquery to do that because it's easy. When I do 'var a = $(htmlstring)'. I get the warning "displaying insecure conent." I am not displaying it. It's just in the variable and not rendered. Why am I getting t
[18:22:32] <ajpiano> aibo472: you don't need to include the single quotes
[18:23:16] <Asone> $(world).ready(function(){revolution();});
[18:23:19] <Asone> amidoinitright ? :D
[18:23:49] <aibo472> if i take it out, it still doesn't work
[18:23:49] <ajpiano> jajklfmsklmdfamlk
[18:23:51] <ajpiano> aibo472
[18:23:56] <ajpiano> you don't put a bloody # in the dom
[18:24:10] <ajpiano> <ul id="#One-nav"
[18:24:10] <ajpiano> wat?
[18:24:23] <aibo472> fml.
[18:24:29] <ajpiano> no fMl
[18:24:52] <aibo472> fuck it... really.
[18:25:01] <ajpiano> aibo472: do you know how to like
[18:25:04] <ajpiano> log to the console
[18:25:06] <ajpiano> and debug
[18:25:37] <aibo472> i focussed on js
[18:25:40] <ajpiano> you were trying to select lol
[18:25:51] <ajpiano> select #One-nav'
[18:25:59] <aibo472> because of all the stupid id-links
[18:26:25] <ajpiano> when you concatenate strings together it returns a string, you don't have to do $( ' "#"+ something + "else" ' ) or whatever nonsense you had
[18:27:08] <seancurtis> ronxyz: you could try dropping the "http" from the url and it'll auto detect based on the page. Eg <img src="//foo.com/bar.png"> - the browser will call it using http or https depending on the mode of the calling page
[18:27:19] <seancurtis> ronxyz: gotta make sure the calling page supports ssl though
[18:27:43] <aibo472> ajpiano: i can't think about all that now... the whole thing is just too stupid
[18:27:54] <ajpiano> lol
[18:28:02] <ajpiano> i like how you're somehow laying this at the feet of "it"
[18:28:13] <aibo472> but thank you for helping me and my sleeping brain out
[18:28:22] <ronxyz> Let me ask an easier question. Is there a way to not to get "displaying insecure content in an ssl page when executing this?" var content$ = $('<img src="http://www.google.com/intl/en_com/images/srpr/logo3w.png" />');
[18:28:44] <ronxyz> Why does Chrome complain? I am not displaying it, it's just stored in a variable.
[18:29:02] <ajpiano> it's creating a new image element
[18:29:09] <ajpiano> and attempting to load the src
[18:29:24] <ajpiano> it doesn't matter that it isn't in the dom yet
[18:29:33] <aibo472> oh hey, everything works just fine... miracle.
[18:29:36] <ajpiano> ronxyz: do what seancurtis just suggested
[18:29:45] <theCole> ya, that seems kind of backwards to me aibo472
[18:29:58] <theCole> why would you wrap that in a $?
[18:30:34] <seancurtis> ronxyz: $('<img src="//www.google.com/intl/en_com/images/spr/logo3w.png" />');
[18:31:28] <ronxyz> ok. What I want to do is to proxify all the images, and replace the source to "proxifyingstring( + src of each image)". seancurtis solution doesn't work very well in that case. The only solution I see is to use javascript regex. Is there a way of doing this with jquery?
[18:31:50] <Asone> replace() ?
[18:32:01] <ajpiano> ?jsisjs @ ronxyz
[18:32:01] <bot-t> ronxyz, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[18:32:26] <ajpiano> ronxyz: you could do $("img").attr("src", function(i, src) {  return DO A REGEX ON SRC;  })
[18:33:10] <ronxyz> ajpiano: I can't because $("img") loads the src before it replaces it. That's what I am trying to do but I get the warning.
[18:33:19] <ajpiano> ronxyz: the *principle* applies
[18:33:54] <ajpiano> but if you need to do it while they're still strings
[18:33:57] <ajpiano> yes just use js
[18:34:05] <ajpiano> loop over the strings and do a regex replace....
[18:34:32] <ronxyz> that's the solution I am considering. I think I will move with that.
[18:34:36] <ronxyz> thanks
[18:53:46] <ae86-drifter> hi there, i have a jquery dialog with an iframe, the css for the iframe is 100% height/width inside the dialog, but is there a way to autoresize the dialog depending on how big the iframe contents is? the default autoresize option desn't seem to work
[18:57:32] <wao> hey, change topic
[18:57:37] <wao> 1.6.4 is out.
[18:58:17] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: you'd need to calculate the actual height/width inside the iframe and then bubble it up to the containing page and then have that page resize the iframe accordingly
[18:59:03] <ae86-drifter> i see, what do you mean by bubble though, i assume you mean some way of sending the values to the parent page, but how would one accomplish this?
[19:00:01] <ae86-drifter> i can use $('html').width() & height
[19:00:19] <ae86-drifter> but thats in the iframe and i don't know how i could send this to the main page
[19:01:56] <seancurtis> we do it in our app but I'm not really sure how
[19:02:00] <ae86-drifter> sometimes the iframe will have more content so the height of the dialog should increase according to the content but the width should be always the same actually
[19:02:05] <seancurtis> I think you can transfer values or watch values from the parent
[19:02:53] <ae86-drifter> yeah ok gotta figure out how to transfer these values now that's all
[19:04:50] <ae86-drifter> would this work? var iframeheight = $(document.getElementById(iframeId).contentDocument).height();
[19:05:34] <tbranyen> ae86-drifter: $(iframeId).contents().height() ?
[19:06:44] <ae86-drifter> ok tbranyen i'll try that, thanks
[19:07:36] <alex7> anyone use touchscroll?
[19:11:52] <ae86-drifter> invalid assignment left hand side?
[19:11:55] <ae86-drifter> i get an error
[19:12:27] <coldhead> try turning your screen around
[19:12:56] <ae86-drifter> what do u eman?
[19:13:01] <ae86-drifter> im using this code: $('#dialog-1').height() = $('#dialog-1-iframe').contents().height();
[19:13:16] <coldhead> the thing you have on the left there is not a variable
[19:13:23] <coldhead> it will return the height
[19:13:37] <coldhead> it's like you're trying to say '180px' = 'some other thing'
[19:13:48] <ae86-drifter> so im setting a getter
[19:13:49] <ae86-drifter> kk
[19:13:54] <ae86-drifter> one sec
[19:13:59] <coldhead> man you are down with the lingo
[19:14:03] <coldhead> good work
[19:14:05] <coldhead> god i want pasta
[19:15:31] <ae86-drifter> yesss it works!
[19:15:44] <coldhead> ?hi5 @ ae86-drifter
[19:15:44] <bot-t> ae86-drifter, âµ
[19:18:43] <ae86-drifter> i had to add contents().find("html").width() though after putting it in the brackets
[19:26:35] <ae86-drifter> ok, now is there a way to send the $(window).load event of the iframe to the parent? lol
[19:26:54] <mxc_> anyone know where I can download the plugin/code for Ben Alman's jquery-sphere3d
[19:27:03] <ae86-drifter> actually that was a dumb question
[19:28:09] <lduros> in javascript, what would you say is the difference between a method and a function? And are they really different? I think of a method as a function that's entered as the property of an object, but then, what is the function? Only is it a function when it belongs to the global scope?
[19:30:34] <ngharo> dood that is deep
[19:31:13] <coldhead> it doesn't have to be global
[19:31:22] <coldhead> you could have a function within a method
[19:32:14] <coldhead> methods are functions associated with objects, IMO
[19:32:22] <coldhead> and functions are detached
[19:32:41] <lduros> coldhead: so if in an object (and all is an object in js no?) you have: var myfunc = function() { //something here. } -- this is a method right?
[19:32:50] <lduros> coldhead: ok
[19:33:18] <lduros> so if you have function blah() { }, then that's a function within the object, rather than a method?
[19:33:29] <Spadeski> How do I make one of those code-blocks you see on pastebin
[19:33:56] <coldhead> lduros: i think of a function as an object if you call it as a property of an object. some_obj.this_is_a_method() vs this_is_just_a_function()
[19:34:12] <lduros> coldhead: ok, i see
[19:34:23] <coldhead> what do you mean, Spadeski >
[19:36:21] <ae86-drifter> ok i've tried and failed, is there a way to send the $(window).load event of the iframe to the parent?
[19:36:49] <Spadeski> coldhehad like numbereed list but you cantselect thenumbers and it autoscrolls
[19:37:43] <ae86-drifter> i tried $('#iframe').load() and  $('#iframe').contents().load()
[19:38:11] <ae86-drifter> there's a picture that loads in the iframe and i need to bind a function in the parent
[19:38:19] <ae86-drifter> when the picture finishes loading
[19:38:31] <ae86-drifter> or even dom ready would be good enough
[19:43:42] <jimi_hendrix> hi, i am doing some work with a canvas, and i need click and drag functionality. by default, if i click an drag, the browser tries to highlight stuff. does jquery have any functionality to prevent that from happening?
[19:44:18] <ae86-drifter> do you use the draggable() function?
[19:44:30] <ae86-drifter> i am doing a similar thing and i am not having that issue
[19:45:09] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, no, i was unaware of its existence
[19:45:50] <ae86-drifter> okay, well you can simply do $('#some-div').draggable();
[19:46:14] <ae86-drifter> and this will make that div or whatever draggable, i think jquery must of worked around that issue already
[19:46:26] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, alright, perfect
[19:46:40] <jimi_hendrix> and i am already using jquery-ui, so it isnt an additional dependency
[19:46:55] <ae86-drifter> nope its in jquery UI
[19:47:01] <ae86-drifter> unless you took it out
[19:47:38] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, right, but i am using jquery-ui anyway, so it isnt like i need to include it just for this functionality
[19:47:42] <ae86-drifter> theres also droppable() which may be of some help
[19:48:05] <ae86-drifter> no, like i said it's already part of jquery-ui, no need to include any plugins etc or whatever
[19:48:20] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, we are saying the same thing :)
[19:48:36] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, do i need to surround the canvas with a div and then call draggable on it, or can i just call draggable on my canvas?
[19:48:53] <coldhead> ?tias
[19:48:53] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:49:00] <ae86-drifter> you call gragablle on any element that you want to be able to drag,
[19:49:17] <jimi_hendrix> ok
[19:49:18] <ae86-drifter> if you make the canvas dragable the WHOLE canvas will move around, which may not be what you want
[19:50:23] <Spadeski> What is the right code to put my code into the WCC thing an thetype like define my doctype
[19:50:34] <jimi_hendrix> ae86-drifter, alright, thanks
[19:50:38] <ae86-drifter> <!doctype html>
[19:50:41] <ae86-drifter> for html5
[19:50:55] <Spadeski>  ty
[19:52:16] <SinnerNyx> i have a problem. I am trying to get the difference between an element and it's parent (in terms of position). I read up on position(), but when I use it it returns {left:0,top:0} even if the object (relative to the parent) is midway through the parent.
[19:52:44] <ae86-drifter> what is the position property in css ?
[19:52:58] <ae86-drifter> oh relatiev?
[19:53:21] <SinnerNyx> in this case it's normal.
[19:53:30] <SinnerNyx> so does that mean i can't get its relative position?
[19:53:30] <ae86-drifter> well it wont work
[19:53:33] <SinnerNyx> ic
[19:53:34] <ae86-drifter> try offset
[19:53:43] <coldhead> ?offset
[19:53:44] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[19:54:18] <SinnerNyx> that doesn't work then. although I suppose I could take the offset and then the parent.offset and subtract one from the other
[19:54:59] <ae86-drifter> yep
[19:57:42] <SinnerNyx> what the... its weird offset gives me what I expected from position()...
[19:58:04] <SinnerNyx> is it possible that it gives me the position relative to the nearest 'position:relative' ancestor?
[19:59:50] <SinnerNyx> nevermind
[20:00:02] <SinnerNyx> its giving totally weird data... i can't figure this one out yet
[20:06:02] <Spadeski> SinnerNyx if you find the anwser too your quesstion please do share
[20:07:08] <SinnerNyx> Spadeski, ya sorry. I had an unrelated bug. I was pointing at the wrong image which is why I was getting random data. i think doing element.offset().left-parent.offset().left
[20:07:39] <Spadeski> awsome
[20:07:40] <SinnerNyx> should work fine
[20:07:47] <Spadeski> tyvm
[21:16:09] <kurol> i knew it!
[21:17:44] <coldhead> i no u it

[21:39:22] <iaj> Hey there... When I got a certain a href and I want to connect 2 events (eg. for once start a download, and secondly, tell a certain div to slidetoggle, what do I need fo that to know? Or rather, how can I make this work?
[21:46:11] <Cork> iaj: you mean when they click the link it starts a download (the href) and you want to slide a div in the page at the same time?
[21:49:37] <Cork> iaj: cause queue isn't called
[21:50:25] <Cork> iaj: the previus queue needs to call dequeue to call the next on the list
[21:50:40] <SinnerNyx> why doesn't this work as i expect it to? The image disappears but the new picture never reappears :( http://jsfiddle.net/8pKDn/2/
[21:51:04] <Cork> but that also means that if your "//some intermediate processing goes here." takes too long the dequeue will call before the queue exist
[21:51:16] <Cork> opps
[21:51:19] <Cork> wrong nick
[21:51:32] <Cork> SinnerNyx: those two last lines was for you
[21:52:00] <Cork> *three
[21:52:25] <SinnerNyx> Cork, ic. so lets say it takes too long would it be bad if the dequeue is called before the queue exists?
[21:52:40] <Cork> no but the queue wouldn't happen
[21:53:04] <SinnerNyx> :S
[21:53:04] <Cork> in other words the way you write the code is racy
[21:53:17] <iaj> Cork: is that hard to do, or do you have a handy example for me for that one?
[21:53:20] <SinnerNyx> ic. is there a more appropriate way to achieve what i want?
[21:54:17] <Cork> SinnerNyx: you could ex. add your code to the queue, and save a varable you set when the previus queue executes
[21:54:29] <Cork> it calls dequeue
[21:54:39] <Cork> and when your code is done, it checks if it should call dequeue
[21:55:04] <Cork> iaj: you haven't answerd if thats what you meant
[21:55:10] <SinnerNyx> i think i'm missing something about queues and dequeue Cork. is this a step in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/8pKDn/3/
[21:55:29] <willmarshall> Backbone question! When setting up event handlers in Views, is there anything I need to do other than put my event and function in the events{} hash in the View, and instantiating that view?
[21:56:28] <willmarshall> I'm unable to get a click event on body to trigger (as a simple test-case)
[21:57:56] <Cork> SinnerNyx: http://jsfiddle.net/8pKDn/4/
[21:58:32] <iaj> Cork: yeh well theres an a href, and I want to lauch a download with it, and to add a slideToggle event to #foo.
[21:58:57] <Cork> iaj: thats the thing, your leaving information out
[21:58:58] <iaj> eg. your first statement was correct yeas:)
[21:59:18] <iaj> 2 events on one href :D
[21:59:24] <Cork> iaj: do you want to have a click event that does window.open, or is it just a plain http request when you click the link
[21:59:42] <Cork> iaj: no that would be one
[21:59:54] <Cork> just bind a click event on the link and do you animation
[22:00:04] <Cork> just don't do event.preventDefault()
[22:00:10] <iaj> ohhh.. well actually I dont get the question correctly
[22:00:17] <iaj> but I guess that makes sense :)
[22:00:32] <Cork> you==your
[22:00:34] <iaj> so I just use linkylink.bind... ?
[22:00:57] <Cork> iaj: is it multible links?
[22:01:27] <iaj> nah just one
[22:01:55] <Cork> linifylink.click(function() { something.slideToggle() });
[22:02:31] <iaj> oh ok.. I thought .click would actually invoke a click
[22:02:39] <iaj> perfect - gracias!
[22:02:48] <Cork> iaj: it does, if you don't pass it a parameter
[22:03:03] <Cork> its a shorthand for bind('click', function() {});
[22:03:19] <iaj> aaaaaaaaaaah... ok.. then all makes sense
[22:03:21] <iaj> thanks Cork

[22:23:08] <ionico> yes coldhead, but what i mean is if there is a plug in or something to do this easily
[22:24:06] <coldhead> $('selector').animate({property_to_animate: 'target'})
[22:24:10] <coldhead> it's pretty simple :)
[22:24:14] <b0x> $(*).just-add-water-animations-on-everything().
[22:24:28] <coldhead> ?animate @ ionico
[22:24:28] <bot-t> ionico, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[22:25:03] <coldhead> ionico: play with this one maybe http://jsfiddle.net/qSeNj/1/
[22:28:57] <ionico> and there is a plug in that you can recomend me to do this easily, like jQuery.spritely or somehing ?
[22:29:22] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I want to use jquery to pull all the html content of an iframe and inject it into the DOM of another page, any tips on how I might do this?
[22:29:51] <coldhead> ionico: any plugin will just make it more complicated, not less
[22:30:03] <Cork> oojacoboo: is it the same origin?
[22:30:06] <coldhead> if you don't want to use animate there might be a helper for common animations
[22:30:12] <coldhead> ?fade @ ionico
[22:30:12] <oojacoboo> Cork: no
[22:30:13] <bot-t> ionico, .fadeIn() - Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[22:30:20] <coldhead> ?slideToggle @ ionico
[22:30:20] <bot-t> ionico, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[22:30:22] <Cork> oojacoboo: then there is no way to do that
[22:30:40] <Cork> oojacoboo: js plainly can't access the content of an iframe from another origin
[22:30:48] <oojacoboo> Cork: you can't get innerHtml store that, then inject it?
[22:30:57] <oojacoboo> oh
[22:31:03] <Cork> oojacoboo: no, you can't access it at all
[22:31:12] <Cork> and thats intentional
[22:31:14] <oojacoboo> Cork: it wouldn't be an iframe of another origin
[22:31:24] <oojacoboo> it'd just be the html of a url
[22:31:37] <Cork> oojacoboo: from the same domain?
[22:31:50] <oojacoboo> same root domain :/
[22:31:57] <oojacoboo> it's not to steal shit
[22:32:04] <oojacoboo> I have to deal with zendesk's bullshit design
[22:33:14] <Cork> well if you can access it all you need to do is $('#your-target-element-in-your-page).append($('body', iframe.contentDocument));
[22:33:41] <oojacoboo> Cork: I don't want to create an iframe
[22:33:53] <Cork> you just said you did...
[22:33:54] <oojacoboo> I want to inject the html into the document, so the links will open in the parent
[22:34:05] <oojacoboo> I didn't mean to say that, I was thinking iframe earlier
[22:34:16] <Cork> so... you want to do an ajax call?
[22:34:22] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:34:30] <Cork> ?.load @ oojacoboo
[22:34:31] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[22:34:35] <Cork> bah...
[22:34:41] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[22:34:44] <oojacoboo> something like that?
[22:34:50] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[22:35:20] <Cork> specially the Loading Page Fragments part
[22:35:49] <oojacoboo> Cork: it's not a portion, I've created a partial on the target domain which will load only the content I need
[22:36:15] <oojacoboo> so, I just need all the info of the target url to inject into a DOM element on the local domain
[22:36:21] <Cork> then just a normal .load(url) then
[22:36:48] <Cork> (as long as cross-origin doesn't block you)
[22:37:03] <oojacoboo> we'll see, this seems too easy
[22:37:25] <Cork> cause its a fundamentaly easy problem
[22:37:39] <oojacoboo> that's what I like to hear
[22:38:01] <oojacoboo> I personally think zendesk should offer a header/footer template method
[22:38:06] <oojacoboo> instead of requiring js injecting
[22:40:00] <Cork> oojacoboo: not js injection, but js loading
[22:40:06] <Cork> injection is an attack ;)
[22:40:28] <oojacoboo> well, yea, but you are INJECTING html into the DOM
[22:40:55] <oojacoboo> inserting if you like
[22:41:11] <Cork> insert, load, add i'm ok with all of those
[22:41:47] <Cork> js injection is something completly different :)
[22:42:20] <oojacoboo> xss
[22:52:44] <iaj> Cork: can I have that click() if theres already a onclick="" written over that href?
[22:53:59] <Cork> iaj: as long the the onclick doesn't call return false;
[22:54:31] <seancurtis> iaj: if there's an onclick="" on the <a> then do the following: 1.) Find out who did it and punch them in the nose 2.) Remove the onclick attribute from the markup 3.) Grab a beer and relax :)
[22:54:48] <lazyPower> beer..that sounds like a grand idea
[22:55:15] <lazyPower> Glad we keep you aorund seancurtis. You've given me a renewed sense of self now that i'm going to get some moosehead out of my icebox
[22:55:16] <iaj> seancurtis: :))))))))
[22:55:22] <seancurtis> 5 mins until beer o'clock for me lazyPower
[22:55:32] <lazyPower> its 2am here, its TIME for a beer
[22:55:34] <coldhead> a renewed sense of self?
[22:55:37] <coldhead> is that legal?
[22:55:41] <seancurtis> well past time for a beer lazyPower
[22:55:43] <lazyPower> only if seven states
[22:55:45] <coldhead> STOP GIVING PEOPLE DRUGS SEAN
[22:55:47] <lazyPower> *in
[22:55:57] <Genesis730> I keep getting this error and wondered if anyone knew if it was a bug or if there is a fix....   elem.nodeName is undefined   IN jquery.js on line 4570 (using v1.6.4)
[22:56:23] <seancurtis> Genesis730: what code are you calling that's triggering that?
[22:56:54] <Genesis730> not 100%, is there an easy way to see what called the function?
[22:57:21] <seancurtis> maybe break on error in Firebug script panel?
[22:57:21] <phrearch> morning
[22:57:27] <ae86-drifter> what would i do to call a function from an iframe's parent? i tried $(window).parent().someFunction();, not working
[22:57:52] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: look at window.top
[22:58:05] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: as in google it - I think that's where you need to look
[22:58:10] <mcsilvio> hi guys. i just wrote a little java application that takes a folder as input (containing text files), reads the files, and writes a single text file out. i am considering making this a web application for various reasons. but i dont know if web sites SHOULD do this kind of file reading and writing. any thoughts?
[22:58:30] <ae86-drifter> i've been googling it but i think i was on the wrong track
[22:59:00] <oojacoboo> mcsilvio: it's called DirectoryIndexes
[22:59:23] <seancurtis> mcsilvio: well I don't believe websites can directly access the file system - but you could possibly do something like this with the file API. You'd need user interaction to select the files however
[22:59:53] <phrearch> mcsilvio: try to convert it with https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki ?
[23:00:04] <phrearch> that one features a virtual filesystem
[23:00:29] <Sam-T> is there a way to disable multiple selections with selectable()?
[23:00:36] <mcsilvio> seancurtis: ah ok. just to clarify, i do intend for the user to select the folder for reading and writing. and also these actions are for files on the client's file system. not the server.
[23:00:53] <mcsilvio> thx everyone
[23:01:09] <Genesis730> seancurtis, when i breakpoint on error, it breaks in jquery.js line 4570
[23:01:27] <seancurtis> Genesis730: can you step back up the execution stack?
[23:01:56] <phrearch> trying to create a jq extension, but i got problems keeping state between multiple instances(new instance overwrites old instance data). any idea how to cope with that properly? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476845/
[23:02:13] <seancurtis> Genesis730: if you don't have too much JS then just start commenting out blocks until you no longer get the error - then just narrow down to where it is
[23:02:29] <seancurtis> there may be a better way but I'm not sure
[23:04:07] <ajpiano> phrearch: do $.extend({}, $.ctx.defaults, params)
[23:04:20] <ajpiano> phrearch: right now you are modifying the defaults object over any over again
[23:04:30] <coldhead> and*
[23:04:58] <mcsilvio> im reading that clientside scripts can not access the clients file system. is there a safe workaround? my intention isnt to act insecurely. but is there a way i can trigger the user to accept an upload option that i give him? or should i just abandon this reading/writing of the clients file system
[23:05:35] <ajpiano> lol
[23:05:46] <ajpiano> you should do the latter
[23:05:52] <ajpiano> or write a really sweet letter to the browser
[23:06:10] <ajpiano> "dear mr browser i promise i'm not gonna do anyhting bad! pinkyswear!!"
[23:06:45] <mcsilvio> ajpiano: will that work? i can provide references
[23:07:09] <ajpiano> hahah
[23:07:15] <mcsilvio> :P
[23:07:28] <phrearch> ajpiano: same with the change
[23:07:47] <ajpiano> phrearch: tehre are probably other things you're doing similar, i only glanced :/
[23:07:51] <lazyPower> mcsilvio: theres only one way i can think of to make that work, and its been stated already. THe user will have to upload aforementioned files, which you can do whatever with them once you've captured the data. Otherwise theres no real easy way to circumvent the browser security model to get at the clients filesystem.
[23:08:38] <phrearch> ajpiano: thanks, ill try to clean up the code a bit
[23:08:58] <mcsilvio> lazyPower: sounds good. thanks!
[23:09:02] <lazyPower> Browsers are finicky little sandboxes to play in :| and demanding
[23:09:05] <mcsilvio> thanks all. gtg
[23:09:19] <Genesis730> seancurtis, i think i may have it
[23:12:00] <ajpiano> phrearch: declaring ctx as a global variable...
[23:12:02] <ajpiano> on line 4
[23:12:05] <ajpiano> probably has a lot to do with it as well
[23:12:23] <lazyPower> polluting global namespace with variables eh?!
[23:13:12] <ajpiano> clobbering his instance over and over again
[23:14:44] <ajpiano> function UselessConstructor() {  thing = this;  } thing.prototype.whatever = function() { };  new UselessConstructor();
[23:14:46] <ajpiano> phrearch:
[23:14:47] <ajpiano> ^^
[23:15:11] <phrearch> ajpiano: aha, ctx is global?
[23:15:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:15:30] <ajpiano> is this news to you ?
[23:15:51] <ajpiano> phrearch: your work on the ace collab editor stuff was really useful to me a few months ago :)
[23:16:05] <Genesis730> $(this).closest('tr').animate({   is causing that elem.nodeName is undefined   IN jquery.js on line 4570 (using v1.6.4)  any ideas why or a work around??
[23:16:09] <phrearch> ajpiano: aha cool, yea i always keep on making noob mistakes :)
[23:16:37] <phrearch> did you got the remote cursor thing working in ace?
[23:17:06] <phrearch> im kinda thinking of moving to codemirror2 because its much smaller
[23:17:09] <ajpiano> i did
[23:17:16] <ajpiano> but then the proj got canceld the next day
[23:17:25] <ajpiano> :/
[23:17:29] <phrearch> ow, sorry to hear
[23:17:39] <ajpiano> lol its no prob
[23:17:41] <ajpiano> better off lol
[23:17:50] <phrearch> well, could be handy for other projects as well i suppose
[23:18:17] <ajpiano> ya
[23:18:30] <ajpiano> i think they'll be adding something more official than what we were hacking together
[23:19:01] <rickup> I have a funtion that clears a form and forces a reload of the windows (long story... and even longer to make a change in the first select) http://pastebin.com/5FABsQur    Can I at least distract people with some throbber or useless progress counter?
[23:19:09] <phrearch> yea i suppose so
[23:20:08] <Genesis730> anyone?
[23:20:23] <phrearch> the ot-protocol isnt really the problem. its more that ace doesnt handle remote editing properly yet
[23:20:33] <rickup> and / or I would like to be able to show the detailed alert (the one commented out) but only once.... I tried briefly to figure that out too but I suck at jquery some nice person in here helped me write what evolved into that
[23:22:06] <ajpiano> phrearch:  yeah.. the whole locking the editor and all that
[23:22:10] <ajpiano> such a pain in the arse
[23:23:17] <phrearch> ajpiano: yea, when i got some spare time, ill try to convert to codemirror2 i think
[23:23:33] <phrearch> probably has other problems but its a small lib
[23:24:03] <phrearch> http://syntensity.com/static/python.html
[23:24:11] <phrearch> wonder if that would work with a custom api
[23:24:36] <phrearch> like you can import your own js libs as python modules
[23:25:08] <phrearch> that project is kinda weird. it can compile c/c++ code to javascript
[23:26:24] <phrearch> pretty cool though. there are already some converted projects that seem to work fine. js pdf converter, text-to-speech
[23:26:36] <ajpiano> crazy
[23:27:18] <phrearch> yea :)
[23:28:49] <phrearch> bullet port is kinda useful i think
[23:33:07] <kadnare> What does $(this).html(content)["fadeIn"](); do?
[23:33:21] <kadnare> is ["fadeIn"](); a shortcut for $(this).fadeIn()?
[23:33:27] <rudra> hi can somebody help me with a feedback tab opening in light box?
[23:34:54] <kadnare> $(this).fadeIn("slow", function () { $(this).html(content); });
[23:35:02] <kadnare> I'm just curious, is that the same as the other thing/
[23:36:38] <SinnerNyx|3> if i have a mousemove event triggered on an element, can I transform some of it's event data and send it to the handler of another handler designed for use with another element? specifically I want to convert the event's layerX to the correct layerX for another element
[23:37:20] <SinnerNyx> if i have a mousemove event triggered on an element, can I transform some of it's event data and send it to the handler of another handler designed for use with another element? specifically I want to convert the event's layerX to the correct layerX for another element
[23:48:08] <HardPhuck> guys I have a small problem
[23:48:13] <HardPhuck> i have a menu
[23:48:21] <HardPhuck> that slides down widh scrolling of the page
[23:49:10] <HardPhuck> howerver, if that menu's height exceeds browser's viewport, then menu's last few buttons are never shown
[23:49:21] <HardPhuck> any idea what would be the best way to fix that
[23:55:32] <phrearch> woohoo, finally got that scope right :)
[23:55:33] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/476857/
[23:59:05] <Xotix> hi
[23:59:43] <Xotix> is there still no function which gives me the html tags of my selector? like i pass an id and get e.g. div,p,a etc
[23:59:50] <waseem_> I am trying to build a drag and drop feature in my jQuery *Mobile* application. I tried to use jQuery UI's draggable and droppable methods in my mobile device. It seems that JQUI is not supposed to work with mobile applications. I will highly appreciate if you could give me any pointer that will get me started in the right direction.
