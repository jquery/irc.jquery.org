[00:00:28] <Spadeski> De|work that I cannot do for dialup disallows me to load it all the way
[00:00:55] <Deele> ?
[00:01:04] <Deele> what do you mean by that?
[00:01:30] <Spadeski> its slow as shit
[00:01:48] <Deele> who is slow?
[00:01:55] <Spadeski> my internet
[00:02:10] <Spadeski> usually stops after loads the background
[00:02:32] <Deele> ok, then...
[00:02:40] <Spadeski> can ya help Deele?
[00:04:34] <Deele> Spadeski, http://pastebin.com/ZimGChUd
[00:05:34] <Spadeski> Deele /i have that part its the jquery im havin trouble with
[00:06:06] <Deele> you just use that code for your listing
[00:06:13] <Deele> and you will get jQ done easy
[00:09:00] <Deele> Spadeski, all you need now is click event
[00:09:11] <Spadeski> oh i got it
[00:09:16] <Spadeski> thats a remake
[00:09:58] <Deele> Spadeski, $('.closeIcon').click(function() { $(this).closest('.songEntry').fadeOut('fast'); });
[00:10:31] <Spadeski> Deele Awesome ! tyvm
[00:10:45] <FleetFox> Hello i have somehting like <h1>Title<a class="close"></a></h1> I'm listening with $('h1').live('mousedown',function(){ can i exclude <a> area?
[00:11:13] <Deele> FleetFox, no
[00:11:40] <FleetFox> Is there som workaround besides editing html?
[00:11:42] <Deele> but you can try to get "Title" into another element, and listen live on it
[00:11:54] <FleetFox> Ok i see.
[00:11:59] <FleetFox> thanks
[00:12:15] <willmarshall> Is there any reason why bind("change remove") doesn't work, but two separate bind("change") and bind("remove") calls does?
[00:13:00] <Deele> FleetFox, like, store Anchor into memory, store all heading content and replace it with same element+heading content, append stored Anchor to it
[00:14:02] <Deele> willmarshall, ofcourse it wont work
[00:14:16] <willmarshall> Deele: why not?
[00:14:23] <willmarshall> Deele: JQuery API says it should
[00:14:25] <Deele> willmarshall have you read http://api.jquery.com/bind/#multiple-events
[00:14:36] <Deele> look at syntax carefully
[00:14:49] <willmarshall> Deele: syntax has changed for 1.4?
[00:14:58] <Deele> dunno
[00:15:03] <Deele> shouldn't
[00:15:25] <Deele> what you are comparing to? version 1?
[00:15:31] <willmarshall> I dunno
[00:15:38] <willmarshall> My code fits the syntax given there
[00:15:48] <willmarshall> But it doesn't work, works fine if I make two calls to bind
[00:15:53] <Deele> try reproducing your case in jsfiddle.net
[00:16:10] <Deele> so we see whole picture
[00:17:52] <willmarshall> Deele: No luck, but my env has Coffeescript, Backbone.js etc in it
[00:17:56] <willmarshall> Not a close match at all
[00:18:53] <Deele> willmarshall, you see, "Add resources" button to the left side? add your libraries, if they are not in frameworks section
[00:25:01] <Xotix> hi
[00:26:11] <Spadeski> Deele got it all updated now what if i wanted to make it show a new music block when one is forgotten
[00:28:21] <Deele> Spadeski, you mean like, append to songList?
[00:28:43] <Spadeski> yup
[00:29:18] <Deele> how you will get new music block info?
[00:29:31] <Deele> ajax? or, others are hidden?
[00:29:54] <Spadeski> nah i was planning ajax
[00:30:10] <Deele> and your server will return full HTML, or just a data, like JSON?
[00:32:28] <Spadeski> umm full html idk about json
[00:32:52] <Deele> Spadeski, then your server should return just .songEntry HTML
[00:32:55] <Deele> if that is so
[00:33:00] <Mafiay2k> hi
[00:33:16] <Deele> $('.songList').append(ajaxReturnData)
[00:33:44] <Spadeski> yeah thats what ineeded too
[00:34:04] <Deele> if you want it to fadeIn, then you should make it return display: none and when it is received, make it fadeIn
[00:34:07] <Deele> Mafiay2k, hi
[00:35:17] <Spadeski> yeah i know but thanks :D
[00:35:36] <Spadeski> Do you like to get on projects deele
[00:35:49] <Deele> yeah, I like, I have them a lot
[00:35:51] <Deele> :)
[00:36:38] <Spadeski> Would you like to get on this one ?
[00:37:14] <Deele> no, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give you enough time, as other projects need time too
[00:37:43] <Xotix> hi, may someone help me doing draggable#sortable in a table style? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/draggable-with-tables
[00:38:20] <Spadeski> Deele meaning the oersib wgi fuves accasional help lol
[00:39:18] <Spadeski> i hate laptops
[00:39:28] <Deele> sry, I know only english, russian & latvian :D
[00:40:54] <Mafiay2k> I have some problems with jquery script evolution
[00:40:56] <Mafiay2k> :(
[00:41:03] <Mafiay2k> http://www.cerveza20.com/#videos in ie8 opening the video
[00:41:08] <Mafiay2k> and closing
[00:41:47] <Mafiay2k> when I open "full page video" it leaves the page black
[00:44:31] <Deele> Xotix, afaik, you can only make rows draggable
[00:45:13] <farhad2161> i have a 2mb image in my page and i want to show a 5kb page until the 2mb page loaded completely.please give me some search keyword for googling
[00:45:23] <Deele> as dragging table cells, will be hard to get "ok" view
[00:45:36] <farhad2161> *i have a 2mb image in my page and i want to show a 5kb image until the 2mb page loaded completely.please give me some search keyword for googling
[00:45:41] <Deele> Xotix, $("#mytable td").sortable({revert: true});
[00:45:49] <farhad2161> #javascript
[00:45:57] <Deele> farhad2161, search for progressive jpg
[00:46:33] <Deele> oh, you want show "loading" image
[00:46:44] <farhad2161> Deele: yes
[00:48:30] <Deele> farhad2161, use load() on your real image
[00:48:39] <dgx> How can i Make when one lightbox closes, another one to pop in? Something like after submission of form display message : form send?
[00:49:03] <Deele> I mean, 1. show loading image, 2. use load on real image and insert loading image hiding function in it
[00:49:11] <farhad2161> tel me more
[00:49:21] <Deele> look for load() in jquery docs
[00:49:44] <dgx> Here is what I have: http://pastie.org/2615554
[00:51:20] <Deele> farhad2161, basically $('#loader_img').show(); $('#main_img').load(function(){ $('#loader_img').hide(); });
[00:51:25] <Xotix> Delle, thanks im gonna try that
[00:52:23] <Raydiation> why do i get a settings.config.progressbar is undefined on line 135  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484944/
[00:53:30] <Deele> Raydiation, maybe, cause it is undefined?
[00:54:03] <Raydiation> Deele: didnt i define it at line 40?
[00:54:04] <NodeX> Raydiation:  $(".percentage canvas").first();
[00:55:05] <Raydiation> NodeX: ty, but now im getting settings.config.progressbar.getContext is not a function
[00:55:19] <NodeX> then it can't find the element
[00:55:53] <NodeX> I'm not sure you can do that with json anyway without an anonymouse function
[00:56:25] <Raydiation> firebug says: $(".percentage canvas").first()
[00:56:25] <Raydiation> [canvas]
[00:56:48] <Raydiation> $(".percentage canvas").first()[0].getContext("2d") works
[00:57:06] <NodeX> progressbar : function() {return $(".percentage canvas")[0])
[00:57:21] <NodeX> or change [0] for first()
[00:58:03] <Raydiation> NodeX: first returns an array with the element like $(".percentage canvas") does
[00:58:13] <Xotix> Deele, your example desn't work i think, shouldnt i someone teach my script "if draggen into the area of  tbody make a new tr with a new td and put the content of this into it"?
[00:58:21] <NodeX> then it's finding more than you need
[00:58:26] <NodeX> use a better selector
[00:58:47] <Raydiation> NodeX: its an array with 1 element
[00:59:03] <NodeX> you'll need to pastebin your markup
[00:59:33] <Raydiation> NodeX: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484949/
[01:00:30] <Raydiation> line 63
[01:01:13] <NodeX> why is your canvas element not closed
[01:01:13] <NodeX>  ?
[01:01:17] <Xotix> Deele, i think i got it,  forgot tthe td at  			connectToSortable: "#sortable td", thanks
[01:01:31] <NodeX> lol .. close it and try again!
[01:02:58] <Raydiation> NodeX: closed, same problem
[01:03:43] <NodeX> are you useing the function to return the element or not
[01:03:56] <Raydiation> NodeX: no function
[01:04:07] <NodeX> I dont think you can select like that from JSON
[01:04:09] <Raydiation> is it not possible to set it as an element?
[01:04:22] <NodeX> use an anonymous function like I posted
[01:05:13] <NodeX> I could be wrong but I've never seen it done and never tried to do it - I allways use anonymous funcitons when I need to return elements or values at runtime
[01:06:20] <Mafiay2k> coldhead : Finally could not find a way to use the scrollbar on the (selects) here http://todolimpieza.yxconproyectos.com/ without removing the //self.close(event); at jquery.select.ui.js dunno if anyother else could also help me :(
[01:06:48] <Raydiation> NodeX: progressbar : function(){ return $(".percentage canvas")[0] } works progressbar : function(){ return $(".percentage canvas").first() } does not, ty
[01:07:11] <NodeX> ah yes  ...
[01:07:14] <NodeX> canvas:first
[01:07:31] <NodeX> might be a better fit instead of the [0]
[01:07:41] <Raydiation> NodeX: doesnt work
[01:07:52] <NodeX> stick wiht what works
[01:08:00] <Raydiation> anyway ty
[01:08:04] <NodeX> I would give it an ID personaly or a class of it's own !
[01:08:09] <NodeX> yw :)
[01:12:35] <Spadeski> Deele you still here?
[01:16:00] <Spadeski> How would I append this to a div $("#aud_content").load("../Modules/Module_Show_Pagination_List.php?aud=1", Hide_Load());
[01:16:33] <NodeX> use an ajax request instead
[01:16:46] <calvinmcgee> I have this application, http://jsfiddle.net/CalvinMcGee/2CPsd/12/. And it works fine, except if a user clicks before the animation is ready, the images stacks on eachother. How do I prevent this?
[01:17:07] <NodeX> $.post("URL",{params:params},function(data){$("#your-div").append(data);});
[01:17:09] <Mafiay2k> no one can find the solution on the issue i post :/
[01:18:10] <Spadeski> NodeX what about http://pastebin.com/vkgTTgdv
[01:18:31] <donttrustem> hi guy's what am I missing here http://pastebin.com/R5yGvNYk
[01:18:31] <Spadeski> which returns the date?
[01:18:38] <Spadeski> fata
[01:18:43] <Spadeski> ugh data
[01:18:46] <NodeX> success
[01:41:04] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: why don't you just use the regular select menus the browser supplies
[01:41:05] <Mafiay2k> i have ff 6.02 and Chrome 15.0 and it does not jumps :(
[01:41:09] <NodeX> wow that is getting annoying
[01:41:23] <Mafiay2k> does it was my page? hehe
[01:41:44] <NodeX> ff 3.6.23 Jumps
[01:41:58] <donttrustem> http://pastebin.com/Fimei8Em
[01:42:06] <NodeX> Chrome 14.0 jumps but only on the top one
[01:42:07] <donttrustem> thats working :S
[01:42:26] <NodeX> donttrustem : that's because it's properly closed
[01:42:40] <NodeX> it's a self executing function
[01:42:58] <NodeX> (function ($) { --- YOUR JQUERY CODE -- }(jQuery));
[01:43:07] <donttrustem> NodeX: ah so what do I need to get the other functions working
[01:43:21] <NodeX> remove the (jQuery)); like I said twice
[01:43:23] <r500> http://graffitisys.com/clients/stmachael2/student_history.php?pi=221&pg=sthis  in IE the drop down is not been shown.. iis going behind the banner .
[01:43:32] <donttrustem> NodeX: I have
[01:43:45] <donttrustem> but it ls still not working
[01:43:48] <NodeX> then add (function ($) { at the top
[01:43:52] <NodeX> Drupal sucks ass
[01:44:07] <NodeX> r500 : that's  an IE bug not jquery
[01:44:14] <pngl> Technically, what's the diffference between live() with a context and delegate()?
[01:44:15] <Mafiay2k> coldhead well, actually they need that design :/ ,
[01:44:18] <donttrustem> wtf I am an idiot
[01:44:32] <donttrustem> sorry I completely missed the top section :(
[01:44:35] <NodeX>  r500 : http://jetlogs.org/2008/05/09/jquery-fix-ie-select-box-z-index-bug/
[01:44:40] <r500> NodeX: how do i fix that. as client wont understand that
[01:44:54] <NodeX> and complain to the drupal devs about writing stupid JS includes
[01:45:00] <coldhead> Mafiay2k: they WANT that design :)
[01:45:02] <Mafiay2k> coldhead / NodeX the only thing I changed was $(document).bind("select.selectmenu", function(event) { instead of $(document).bind("mousedown.selectmenu", function(event) { so dont now how it could cause that jump
[01:45:08] <coldhead> but what they NEED is something that works
[01:45:53] <NodeX> Mafiay2k : Pass .. it's probably my screen res and it's adding a scroll bar or somehting
[01:45:55] <r500> NodeX:  thanks will check that
[01:46:00] <coldhead> i'm sorry Mafiay2k, this kind of problem is why i don't use UI
[01:46:03] <coldhead> too gomfusing
[01:46:15] <NodeX> r500 : else google "Internet explorer Select box z-index"
[01:46:29] <NodeX> plenty of fixes out there :)
[01:46:53] <Mafiay2k> NodeX what res do you have?
[01:47:00] <sandman> Så, when defining a "resizable", can I decide the size of the area of the object where I can resize it? As it is, if the object lines with the window border, the OS resize machanism kicks in first so I can't resize the DOM object
[01:47:01] <NodeX> 1600x900
[01:47:55] <donttrustem> NodeX: thanks for your help ….  as I am not a coder I totally missed the top section...
[01:48:16] <sandman> "handles" just defines the borders from where I can resize...
[01:48:23] <sandman> Not how large the "handles" are...
[01:48:32] <NodeX> nps donttrustem
[01:48:36] <Xotix> http://xotix.bplaced.net/jquery/ if you take an element over the container on the rght, the space which appears between the elements is not as big as the dragged element, hwo do i solve that?
[01:48:39] <sandman> As it is - resizing from east ("e") seems to be with a 1px wide handle...
[01:48:56] <NodeX> sandman : try #jquery-ui
[01:49:06] <sandman> Nodex: oh, sorry
[01:49:25] <NodeX> sometimes people are in here who do the UI stuff so you may get lucky
[01:49:27] <Mafiay2k> NodeX 1600 should be enough
[01:49:31] <NodeX> might have better luck in there :)
[01:49:32] <sandman> Not as many people in there, though...
[01:49:37] <sandman> Nodex: Ok :)
[01:49:49] <NodeX> or try again later / use the jquery forum mebbe
[01:50:06] <sandman> Yeah, this is my first try, then it's usua stackoverflow or something like that :)
[01:50:14] <sandman> usually
[01:50:45] <NodeX> Xotix : do you mean when you drag it before it drops
[01:51:38] <Xotix> yyeah
[01:51:45] <Xotix> that "example" space NodeX
[01:51:46] <NodeX> if you you need to get the height of the dropzone and add the height of the dragged element to it
[01:52:25] <Xotix> ah okay thanks :)
[01:52:39] <sandman> Solution: .ui-resizable-e { width: 20px }
[01:52:41] <sandman> Easy :)
[01:52:47] <NodeX> :D
[01:53:30] <Mafiay2k> NodeX could you please send me a capture (jpg or whenever) how do you see it on those versions?
[01:53:46] <NodeX> err .. browsershots.org lol
[01:54:15] <Mafiay2k> yes
[01:54:23] <Mafiay2k> but there can force to click on select
[01:54:31] <Mafiay2k> want to see the selectbox
[01:54:51] <NodeX> it's a normal select box
[01:54:56] <NodeX> once clicked
[01:57:38] <r500> bgiframe didnt help  NodeX :(
[01:57:57] <r500> http://graffitisys.com/clients/stmachael2/main.php NodeX
[01:58:05] <Mafiay2k> probably is cos this
[01:58:07] <Mafiay2k> $(document).bind("select.selectmenu", function(event) { instead of $(document).bind("mousedown.selectmenu",
[01:58:11] <Mafiay2k> select.selectmenu
[02:08:54] <sheldonh> i am extremely new to jquery, confronted with a large body of existing code, so sorry if this sounds daft.   can a custom validator method stash some json in a non-global variable, such that it is available later in errorPlacement? thanks in advance
[02:10:41] <r500> Mafiay2k:  is that for me???
[02:20:51] <NodeX> sheldonh : yes - but it's polluting the global namespace
[02:20:59] <NodeX> you can put it in the window[]
[02:21:17] <sheldonh> NodeX: well, okay if i have to go there. i was hoping for something cleaner :)
[02:21:29] <sheldonh> NodeX: but thanks for that, at least now i have a fallback
[02:21:38] <quicksilver> the global namespace *is* window
[02:21:43] <quicksilver> in web browser javascript.
[02:22:03] <NodeX> ^^ it's what I said lol
[02:22:11] <sheldonh> yeah, i don't feel like i stepped into anything there ;)
[02:22:19] <quicksilver> you said "you can put it into window[]"
[02:22:26] <quicksilver> sounded like that was a different choice from global ;)
[02:22:28] <quicksilver> but it's the same.
[02:22:31] <NodeX> after saying it polluted the namespace
[02:22:34] <Mafiay2k> r500 no sorry did not read
[02:22:38] <NodeX> anyway
[02:22:55] <NodeX> sheldonh : when I need to reference things later I put them in a hidden input sometimes
[02:23:07] <NodeX> or use jquery's data()
[02:23:23] <sheldonh> hmmm, jquery's data(). will looksee, thanks
[02:23:39] <NodeX> it stores arbitrary data into an element
[02:23:54] <chee> i just write them down on a piece of paper
[02:23:59] <NodeX> hehe
[02:24:04] <NodeX> and scan / email it
[02:24:05] <NodeX> :P
[02:24:18] <Martin_> if I have a $('<img />') how can I get the html code from it?
[02:24:28] <Mafiay2k> http://www.cerveza20.com/#videos <- ie8 gives me an error on the lightbox when I open the video in full size
[02:24:41] <Mafiay2k> anyone have a clue?
[02:24:43] <NodeX> Martin_ ?
[02:26:00] <Martin_> NodeX: ?
[02:26:17] <Dirkos> I have this line: $(oAccordion).find('#talenContainer, #rekenContainer, #llbContainer, #keuzeruimteContainer').prev().show();
[02:26:32] <Dirkos> can can i show everything where the element itself (the FIND) is visible
[02:26:45] <Martin_> Dirkos: why not add a class to all of those ?
[02:27:06] <Dirkos> cuz its old code and i dont wanna destroy it :)
[02:27:32] <Dirkos> i need to show/hide the prev elements if the element below is visible or not
[02:27:36] <NodeX> [10:24:13] <Martin_> if I have a $('<img />') how can I get the html code from it?
[02:27:39] <NodeX> it makes no sense
[02:27:50] <Dirkos> but how can i do this with all of the records? instead of checking everything by itself?
[02:28:00] <Martin_> NodeX: if I had say $('<img />').attr('src', 'blah');   how can I get <img src="blah" /> from that object
[02:28:08] <Martin_> I thought there was a .toString but it doesn't seem so
[02:28:24] <NodeX> "this" is a representation of the element
[02:28:29] <NodeX> not $(this)
[02:28:46] <NodeX> console.log(this) .. you will see what I mean :)
[02:30:11] <Dirkos> is there something like $('#element:visible') ?
[02:30:23] <NodeX> $().is(":hidden");
[02:30:58] <Martin_> :visible exists too
[02:31:04] <NodeX> if($("#foo").is(":hidden")) { $()...
[02:31:36] <Martin_> Dirkos: what you wrote will work
[02:31:49] <Martin_> but you should use if ($('#element:visible').length) { }
[02:40:33] <zerovic> hey guys, i used to have a simple but yet cool image hover effect, but i can't find it anywhere... did you see anything like this before? http://zerovic.com/jquery.jpg
[02:40:35] <zerovic> thanks
[02:46:11] <Martin_> has anyone worked with FileReader?
[02:50:55] <DarsVaeda> what event is triggered when I click on a radiobutton to select it?
[02:53:19] <jhine> Hi. How can I create an element and give it attributes with jquery?
[02:55:22] <NodeX> $("<p>My element</p>").attr("id","my-id").appendTo('body');
[02:55:45] <NodeX> creates p#my-id and adds it to the document body
[02:58:37] <Martin_> DarsVaeda: i'd use .change()
[02:58:56] <DarsVaeda> kay, thanks
[03:07:30] <ryanmcdonough> Has anyone got any experience with jqflot in here?
[03:16:36] <ryanmcdonough_> anyone talking?
[03:31:06] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[03:31:25] <Double_Rainbow> if i am loading html elements to load html fragments
[03:31:27] <bateman> $('body').html('hello world);
[03:31:53] <Double_Rainbow> i am being forced to use the ajax success callback to call events on these new html elements
[03:31:59] <Double_Rainbow> is there a better way?
[03:32:36] <quicksilver> Double_Rainbow: you could use .live or .delegate
[03:32:43] <Double_Rainbow> ohhhh
[03:32:55] <quicksilver> personally I don't find calling a subroutine in the success callback a huge problem though
[03:33:13] <Double_Rainbow> will .live work even if the elements are not psysically there during document load?
[03:33:57] <bateman> that's the whole point of .live
[03:34:11] <Double_Rainbow> bateman: and what is that?
[03:34:36] <skamikaze> ?live @ Double_Rainbow
[03:34:37] <bot-t> Double_Rainbow, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[03:34:58] <Double_Rainbow> or in the future, i love that

[03:39:03] <Martin_> has anyone worked with drag/drop?
[03:40:21] <Whirl3d> Good morning. Anybody know of any custom UI themes that are dark...I know about theme roller, I am familiar with the current UI themes, I was hoping someone knew of other publically shared themes...any help?
[03:44:58] <Whirl3d> the silence is deafening....what is this some kind of record for this channel?
[03:48:33] <Martin_> Any ideas why when drag/dropping multiple files, an image is only shown for the last one: http://pastie.org/private/h7rcnbwbuxl62ttonibgw
[03:48:42] <Martin_> if I drag/drop singulars then they all have images
[03:49:53] <Whirl3d> why does JqueryUI have a way of replacing scrollbars? Dark themes look terrible in JqueryUI if they have scrolling content.
[03:49:59] <Whirl3d> *doesn't
[03:51:04] <spike_1st> Hello...is it possible to create an entire website with Jquery and once completed, make it work with OpenCart?
[04:05:10] <inad922> Hello
[04:05:36] <inad922> Is it possible to hide options from a select with jquery? So I like select an option and call hide() on it?
[04:08:25] <Martin_> inad922: you'll have to remove them
[04:08:36] <Martin_> I think at least.
[04:08:49] <Martin_> try it
[04:09:15] <fuchstronaut> I am using this plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip, is it so outdated, that i shouldnt use it?
[04:09:46] <fuchstronaut> it is bundled with a plugin called "delegate". delegate is part of jquery since some time now
[04:10:58] <Whirl3d> is it possible to use opacity with jqueryUI?
[04:11:10] <fuchstronaut> why not, its a css property
[04:11:47] <Whirl3d> I wish someone would update the theme roller. The description of the components to theme make no sense to me.
[04:13:05] <fuchstronaut> you can simply use the classnames to style it yourself
[04:13:44] <inad922> Martin_: Ok I try it. I may have to store it then.
[04:13:51] <inad922> it -> them
[04:14:45] <Whirl3d> right, I could develop jquery from scratch as well if I had the time/inclination/skill (not likely)
[04:15:53] <inad922> Martin_: Yea hide just won't work here.
[04:18:05] <Whirl3d> inad922, if you make a jsfiddle, it'll be easier to help
[04:18:12] <fuchstronaut> why does $('element').click(function(){ $(this).focus(); }); work flawless in firefox, but not in chrome
[04:18:43] <Whirl3d> perhaps you need to return false or e.preventdefault
[04:19:06] <fuchstronaut> erm i mean select()
[04:19:21] <fuchstronaut> in firefox when i click on element (input) it selects its content
[04:19:27] <Martin_> inad922: thought so, you'll have to store your own list too then :)
[04:19:32] <fuchstronaut> in chrome it does the same and then immediently deselcts it
[04:20:09] <inad922> Whirl3d: What's a jsfiddle? I just made a gobal array where I put the uneeded elements and from where I put these elements back when needed.
[04:22:37] <Whirl3d> inad922, it's a pretty nice sandbox where you can share your html/css/js (including the jquery library) and post the url to the project back here. Then we can look at it and make suggestions.
[04:22:58] <donCams> fuchstronaut: $('element').focus ( function(){ this.select(); });
[04:23:13] <Whirl3d> donCams, you beat me to it.
[04:23:17] <inad922> Whirl3d: wow I just checked it. Cool stuff.
[04:23:28] <donCams> :)
[04:23:47] <fuchstronaut> (donCams): yes thats what i already have. it just doesnt really work
[04:23:55] <fuchstronaut> looks like it is a chrome bug or feature
[04:23:57] <Whirl3d> inad922, makes helping out a lot easier when you can see what you are working with. Plus it helps me some times to solve the problem myself before asking...
[04:24:33] <Whirl3d> fuchstronaut, the code you posted doesn't look the same as donCams...
[04:24:43] <dinosaadeh> guys if i have $(element).data('something', jsonObject)  and i want to add to it.. is there a way to add without reading, updating the object and re-saving it?
[04:24:59] <fuchstronaut> yeah, this is a feature or bug of mine. misstyping :)
[04:25:26] <Whirl3d> fuchstronaut, makes it hard to debug...i have the same feature or bug personally as well
[04:26:07] <fuchstronaut> :)
[04:26:12] <Whirl3d> dinsaadeh, perhaps you could just use $(element).data('jsonObject');
[04:26:46] <Whirl3d> that would give you access to the json pairs using $(element).data('somekey') without reading the entire jsonObject
[04:27:05] <dinosaadeh> Whirl3d: i am not reading.. say i have a plugin, and i save the data(pluginName).. in this i put settings and other stuff
[04:27:35] <dinosaadeh> Whirl3d: how can i add something to data(pluginName) without affecting the content of settings
[04:27:58] <Whirl3d> dinosaadeh, can you post a jsfiddle with an example?
[04:28:33] <Whirl3d> dinosaadeh, you can add individual pieces to the data object using the $(element).data("piecename","piecevalue"); nomenclature
[04:33:39] <dinosaadeh> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/UUvbB/
[04:36:18] <inad922> any of you know what's the time complexity of a push on a javascript array object?
[04:36:31] <inad922> Or what's the data structure behind an array?
[04:36:53] <inad922> simple array, hash, stl like array or something else?
[04:39:36] <opple> how to detect if two keys are pressed like if(e.ctrlKey && e.altKey) but this doesn't work
[04:43:42] <Martin_> I have a scenario where I have an <input type="file" /> and I handle drag/drop on the <body> for html5 enabled browsers... The issue is, if people drag a file onto the input then my drag/drop stuff doesn't work and it just populates the <input type="file" />.... I've tried setting .attr('disabled', true) on the drag over but it doesn't work. Any suggestions?
[04:47:25] <aaronmcadam> opple: this might be helpful: http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/259-jquery-keyz-plugin.html
[04:48:43] <aaronmcadam> sorry i thought that plugin supported modifier keys
[04:49:01] <aaronmcadam> well it does, just maybe not combos, try it and see
[04:49:27] <opple> i need a plugin for that?
[04:49:32] <JuJuBee> I want to use jquery to validate a form (make sure they select at least one checkbox etc...).  If I use jq to intercept the form, how do I continue posting it if validation passes?  Do I have to use ajax?
[04:50:28] <adrianp> dont use JS for form validation
[04:50:37] <opple> JuJuBee: no, u can use return
[04:51:03] <JuJuBee> adrianp: why not?   I still use php on server to validate...
[04:51:12] <JuJuBee> opple: example?
[04:51:37] <opple> if(valid())return true else return false
[04:51:58] <adrianp> yeah as long as you got the server-side stuff too
[04:52:43] <JuJuBee> opple: is that in a .submit or .click or something like that?
[04:52:46] <adrianp> use submit() and what opple said
[04:53:38] <JuJuBee> ok thanks
[04:56:54] <Xotix> how do you access the "drop zone" e.g. at sortable?
[05:02:48] <dinosaadeh> i have an string-indexed array and want to convert it to json, how can i do that please/
[05:13:08] <Whirl3d> dinosaadeh, I can't wrap my head around what you are trying to do. Are you trying to make a plugin that gets it's settings from the supplied data object rather than having to pass them in the constructor?
[05:16:40] <JuJuBee> opple does this look ok?  it doesn't seem to work... http://pastebin.com/SwFFfchZ
[05:17:56] <inad922> Shouldn't "#max_price-select option:selected" select an option element? I mean I call insertAfter on the result and it inserts everything inside this text..
[05:18:01] <inad922> I mean element
[05:19:18] <Whirl3d> inad922, again this is a great time to use jsfiddle
[05:20:29] <Whirl3d> ?parseJSON @ dinosaadeh
[05:20:29] <bot-t> dinosaadeh, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:20:56] <inad922> Whirl3d: The problem is I can't insert the html part. It's generated from a django template and several objects.
[05:21:34] <Whirl3d> you can't viewSource in a browser and cut and paste the relevant parts?
[05:22:00] <JuJuBee> Can someone take a look at http://pastebin.com/SwFFfchZ it doesn't work.
[05:22:18] <dinosaadeh> Whirl3d: parseJSON takes a json string and turns it to a json =) with my case, it returns null, i am passing an array
[05:22:51] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, where do you initialize the global variable $err?
[05:25:10] <JuJuBee> Whirl3d: line 10
[05:25:39] <JuJuBee> Oh, the $ .... so used to php...
[05:27:36] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, ding ding ding, on to the bonus round
[05:27:43] <Whirl3d> dinosaadeh, http://piratepad.net/iKgww3GVtv
[05:29:14] <JuJuBee> Whirl3d: does this look better? http://pastebin.com/8H890XMD
[05:30:00] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, no '.' for adding
[05:30:04] <Whirl3d> php again
[05:30:54] <JuJuBee> Yea, just fixed it, but still not working...
[05:32:45] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, these are all really goofy errors, you didn't remove the $ in front of err again
[05:33:12] <JuJuBee> I did in my code, just not when I edited the post...
[05:33:26] <JuJuBee> http://pastebin.com/Y3yQmSkK
[05:33:31] <Whirl3d> there's one more $err in the if($err)
[05:34:45] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/GCKFr/2/
[05:34:50] <inad922> Whirl3d: I created a jsfiddle page http://jsfiddle.net/4Z5vm/ Can you help me on why can't I reinsert elements to minprice from the array?
[05:36:14] <JuJuBee> So the jAlert not working, but alert does...
[05:36:30] <inad922> wow it doesn't even cut out the parts from max list..
[05:39:56] <JuJuBee> Got it, forgot to link to the jalert js file and css file.  Man I should go back to bed and try this day again...
[05:40:03] <JuJuBee> Thanks Whirl3d
[05:41:04] <Whirl3d> JuJuBee, glad you got it working.
[05:41:30] <Whirl3d> inad922, So, you have a list of properties with associated price ranges...
[05:41:51] <Whirl3d> inad922 and you want to select the range (min/max) using the SELECT form field
[05:42:18] <Whirl3d> inad922 which should change the options available in another SELECT form element, right?
[05:42:36] <dinosaadeh> Whirl3d: thanks =)
[05:42:51] <Whirl3d> inad922, and you are having problems changing the options in the result SELECT from field?
[05:43:02] <Whirl3d> dinosaadeh, no problem!
[05:46:12] <zabka> hi, i have a multiselect field. what is the best way to sort value by value and by text(i wanna have a button, where i can choose / switch the sort order=?
[05:46:26] <danstever> hey everyone: i'm sure there is a quick answer to this... I'm trying to run a function on someDiv when I hover over hoverDiv. Any ideas?
[05:46:31] <zabka> s/=?/)/

[05:48:47] <danstever> whirl3d: yup. like this: http://pastebin.com/EYVMGsyh
[05:49:02] <danstever> bot-t: that's to you also. http://pastebin.com/EYVMGsyh
[05:49:04] <bot-t> danstever, Couldn't find "that's to you also. http://pastebin.com/EYVMGsyh" in jQuery Docs.
[05:49:17] <Whirl3d> bot-t is a bot
[05:49:26] <danstever> Oh... my bad
[05:50:04] <Tatsh> i compiled my javascript; is it running too fast now?
[05:50:06] <Tatsh>   if ($('body[id*=page-poll-]').size() === 1) {
[05:50:11] <Tatsh> this doesn't evaluate to true
[05:50:15] <Tatsh> by the time it runs now, the page is white
[05:50:23] <Tatsh> not compiled, it works fine
[05:50:43] <skamikaze> checked error console? what compiler?
[05:51:21] <danstever> Whirl3d: I use that same snippet for my nav rollovers, just changing the $('.targetDiv') to this.
[05:51:43] <Tatsh> this is with closure compiler with advanced optimisations
[05:51:48] <Tatsh> there are no errors in the console
[05:52:28] <Tatsh> i'm removing the line as the next line is a check against window.location
[05:52:31] <skamikaze> Tatsh: does it run if you don't mimize with advanced optimisations checked?
[05:52:40] <Tatsh> yes
[05:52:43] <Tatsh> but i'm removing the line
[05:53:18] <skamikaze> mhm i'd not work around a minifier dude, don't care bout a few bytes more or less
[05:53:18] <Tatsh> yeah, don't need the check; it's useful but not necessary
[05:53:26] <Tatsh> this code is unreadable :)
[05:53:36] <skamikaze> maybe check out uglifyjs as an alternative
[05:54:34] <Tatsh> http://ompldr.org/vYWxjeg and that's how i want it :)
[05:54:36] <Tatsh> lol
[05:54:50] <Tatsh> i don't really care; but obfuscation is funny here because it's javascript
[05:55:16] <skamikaze> and easy beautified with chrome dev tools dude
[05:55:17] <skamikaze> ;)
[05:55:27] <Tatsh> yeah but variable names useless
[05:55:39] <Tatsh> i was able to debug it because i know where each thing lines up against the original files
[05:55:50] <Tatsh> that's how i got advanced compilation to actually work especially with these custom jquery ui widgets
[05:56:18] <Tatsh> the main thing about closure is that it keeps any strings you make; no obfuscation of strings
[05:56:28] <zabka> hi, i have a multiselect field. what is the best way to sort value by value and by text(i wanna have a button, where i can choose / switch the sort order)
[05:57:00] <Maxarn> !rules
[05:57:06] <skamikaze> Tatsh: i don't minimize to obfuscate things, i minimize to get a faster browser experience
[05:57:13] <Tatsh> that's my goal too
[05:57:20] <Tatsh> i cut the file size in half
[05:58:43] <Whirl3d> inad922, I am so sure... did you disappear?
[06:00:40] <Whirl3d> zabka, my best guess is that you are gonna have to do the logic yourself an rebuild your select option manually
[06:00:40] <red> Anyone know if there is a genereal Web Development channel on freenode?
[06:00:53] <Maxarn> Anyone know where you can get help with problems of the cufon script ?
[06:03:21] <beakybal4> hey
[06:04:19] <beakybal4> so here's my code: http://pastie.org/private/ie6mpgyxpp4iwu5wpdyow
[06:05:03] <beakybal4> the revert part on the bottom doesn't change the attribute of the element with the class 'revert' to 'click'
[06:06:20] <Paul_Linney> beakybal4: Try using addClass and removeClass functions for updating class attributes
[06:06:22] <beakybal4> please can someone help me fix it :(
[06:06:55] <beakybal4> hmm, when I tried to use that it said "class xyz undefined" when I tried removing the class
[06:07:01] <beakybal4> hence why i'm using attr
[06:07:41] <adrianp> any reason firebug doesnt stay open when I refresh a page?
[06:07:59] <adrianp> trying to debug script and it closes
[06:14:26] <pachet> beakyba14: was your syntax in the vein of : $(foo).addClass('bar')  ie, passing a string as the argument to the addClass method
[06:22:07] <red> I'm unable to find such a general channel so don't hate for a bit of offtopic question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7610697/why-would-a-web-developer-choose-mac-os-over-windows-linux :) And this is for the Mac people.
[06:22:12] <inad922> if I get a list of elements from a selector can I write an each function which process the elements in reverse order?
[06:24:08] <pachet> ?.reverse() @ inad922
[06:24:10] <bot-t> inad922, jQuery.makeArray() - Convert an array-like object into a true JavaScript array. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[06:24:37] <danstever> Anyone have any idea how to get this to work? this script works when I replace ('.targetDiv') with 'this.' - But i want to change targetDiv - http://pastebin.com/EYVMGsyh
[06:27:24] <pachet> danstever: a jquery object doesnt have the property "src"
[06:27:35] <pachet> the $() wrapper doesnt correlate to a DOM element
[06:27:42] <pachet> use .attr('src') instead
[06:27:52] <CKIDOW> hi
[06:28:19] <CKIDOW> how can I find out if the "hashchange" event was triggert by mouse or by keyboard?
[06:28:21] <pachet> the reason using a vanilla "this" works, is that within the bound function, this refers to the calling element, but as a DOM element, and not a jquery object
[06:28:38] <pachet> hence, to call jquery methods on the scoped "this", you have to wrap it eg $(this)
[06:31:52] <pachet> CKIDOW: there are ways to catch the hashchange event, but im not sure what you mean by mouse or keyboard
[06:32:10] <pachet> if you mean, catching the hash that a user is typing, it can't be done
[06:32:25] <pachet> (until they navigate to the new url)
[06:32:34] <CKIDOW> I want to change the document.location.hash via click on a link
[06:32:48] <CKIDOW> but I also have a "hashchange" event already
[06:33:09] <CKIDOW> handler
[06:33:10] <CKIDOW> sorry
[06:33:59] <CKIDOW> but I only want to execute the handler if the hash was changed manually by typing... so the click event never touchs the handler
[06:37:19] <pachet> i recommend using either ben alman's hashchange plugin for jquery, or the history.js polyfill by lupton
[06:37:32] <pachet> if you use the jq plugin, you'll be able to namespace the event
[06:38:00] <pachet> so, bind a new namespace to the clicks that you want hidden
[06:39:07] <pachet> or there's also jq bbq
[06:39:11] <pachet> for history

[06:48:12] <Kre10s_> sean`, that won't work for me. I needed to detect if an element contains text or some html tag. I ended up using removeClass and an extra selector...
[06:48:33] <sean`> Kre10s_, how does that not work for you
[06:48:40] <sean`> if you can select something that's empty with :empty

[06:49:06] <Brodingo> gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal
[06:49:22] <Kre10s_> sente, the question is not if it is empty or not. it is if it contains an image or some text.

[06:56:51] <pachet> time to retire
[06:58:08] <johanhar> So, how do I make a new dom element in jquery "from scratch"?
[06:58:27] <pachet> johanhar: var a = $('<div />');
[06:58:27] <johanhar> nvm found it
[06:58:29] <johanhar> th
[06:58:30] <johanhar> thx
[07:00:51] <inad922> what does $() return when a selection has no results?
[07:02:22] <thefalling> is there way i can use ajax with a input:file?
[07:02:34] <pachet> inad922: an empty jquery object
[07:03:31] <NodeX> thefalling : no
[07:03:32] <inad922> pachet:If I test equivalence against '$();' will it only be true with empty objects?
[07:03:48] <NodeX> ajax 2 has a spec for it but no browser supports it except nightly webkits
[07:04:35] <erichynds> inad922: test its length property
[07:04:39] <erichynds> $() is always true
[07:04:41] <pachet> ^
[07:07:38] <thefalling> thanks nodeX
[07:07:59] <NodeX> :)
[07:17:01] <dropmouse> hey all, when grabbing .css('top') and other styles, it will return "px" or "em" - is there jQuery way to return just the numeric value? like if I were to use animate i would give it a numeric value right, not a string with "px" or "em" ?
[07:18:45] <sean`> ?offset @ dropdrive
[07:18:45] <bot-t> dropdrive, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[07:18:48] <sean`> dropmouse
[07:18:53] <sean`> sorry dropdrive :D
[07:18:57] <sean`> dropmouse, also see .position
[07:20:31] <pachet> .css returns a string of the property value, not the computed value
[07:20:50] <pachet> so theres not really a jq way to make .css return a number
[07:20:52] <nylinuxhelp> hello, has anyone been using jquery mobile combined with scrollview on a FORM Select element? seems to exhibit an issue where the select menu becomes inactive.
[07:20:59] <inad922> if I have a list/array of results selected by some selector expression and I want to filter all of them which has a value attribute greater than some given number how can I do that?
[07:21:18] <nylinuxhelp> Here's the full description from my developer "when using jquery mobile with scrollview, the <select> form field will not open the pop up for you to choose an option, after a lot of research i have discovered the cause of this problem, when scrolling jquery mobile disables events with preventDefault and stopPropogate. Is there any way to pause this or disable the scrollview js file when the
[07:21:18] <nylinuxhelp> user clicks the select box, i notice that when you click it, it changes to the active state, so that is being picked up, its the firing of the pop up that stalls."
[07:21:29] <NodeX> pachet: parseInt
[07:21:34] <dropmouse> thanks for the input
[07:21:38] <pachet> but you can always parseInt($(foo).css('margin-left'), 10);
[07:21:39] <pachet> er
[07:21:41] <pachet> ^
[07:21:44] <NodeX> hehe
[07:23:24] <dinosaadeh> quick question please, is there a way i can select multiple items with one selector; 3 different IDs
[07:24:03] <NodeX> $("#id, #id2, #id2")
[07:24:11] <NodeX> #id3 **
[07:24:18] <dinosaadeh> NodeX: thanks ^.^
[07:24:21] <NodeX> :)
[07:24:34] <NodeX> doesnt have to be id's .. any selector works
[07:29:26] <pachet> inad922: late response, but : http://jsfiddle.net/ZMdwr/
[07:31:29] <inad922> wow thanks pachet
[07:31:53] <pachet> really just the middle part is what you asked for
[07:31:54] <Aric> I want this link to update the input value... http://jsfiddle.net/fzqFQ/
[07:32:03] <pachet> overloading .filter()
[07:32:04] <Aric> can't seem to remember/figure how to do that
[07:32:29] <Aric> targeting input by name=""
[07:32:35] <Aric> or do i have to have an id?
[07:34:48] <pachet> Aric: http://jsfiddle.net/u6Lyx/
[07:36:18] <Aric> ty, i was just testing with .attr
[07:36:19] <Aric> :)
[07:36:25] <Aric> been awhile since ive used some jquery
[07:36:34] <Aric> not too long but you forget fast ;)
[07:37:01] <pachet> i usually start forgetting by lunch
[07:40:57] <laanes> how does jquery document.ready event act on back button?
[07:41:40] <laanes> i have my preloader unloading on document.ready event
[07:41:46] <laanes> but when i press back button
[07:41:52] <laanes> the event does not fire
[07:41:54] <NodeX> unloading ....
[07:42:05] <laanes> so the preloader sticks around
[07:42:07] <NodeX> do you mean loading
[07:42:13] <laanes> what would be the way around this?
[07:42:16] <NodeX> doc ready is fired ONCE only
[07:42:42] <laanes> can i paste the website link here so you can understand what i mean
[07:43:06] <NodeX> I dont look at websites unless it's a pastebin sorry
[07:43:15] <jak> laanes
[07:43:21] <jak> is this firefox you are using?
[07:43:51] <laanes> yes
[07:43:58] <laanes> in other browsers i dont get this problem
[07:44:18] <Aric> pachet: does it have any problems working with modals? the html/js is exactly what i have but if i try to change the .val of the input inside a modal (and im rnning it after the modal is created) it's not updating
[07:44:57] <laanes> there you go
[07:44:57] <laanes> http://pastebin.com/v8mB4Kb1
[07:45:00] <Aric> im using .load on an empty div#modal, then .modal to launch it as a modal, then that code to change and input field
[07:48:09] <roger21> hi can i make a head request with jquery.ajax ? thtype thing doesn't say so
[07:48:21] <roger21> the type*
[07:48:46] <cafaro> is there a convenient jQuery function for retrieving form value indices? e.g.: <input type="text" name="value[0]" />
[07:48:57] <pachet> Aric: not sure, i'd need to see the code
[07:49:02] <pachet> could be a number of things
[07:49:15] <lastent> Hi is this an array {{name: 'vla1', lastname: 'val2'},{name: 'vla3', lastname: 'val4'},...}?
[07:49:26] <Aric> hmm
[07:49:28] <cafaro> lastent: an object
[07:49:44] <Aric> in chrome dev tools console i run '$('input[name=\"date\"]').val('foo');' and it works fine :/
[07:50:15] <Aric> but in my js i have it as the last event in my click event and it does nothing with no js errors..
[07:50:29] <laanes> jak , i am just removing a div from the DOM when $(document).ready fires, it seems that the event does not fire when using back button, can i use some other event to remove the div?
[07:50:52] <jak> i had this problem
[07:51:02] <jak> afaik there is no event that fires on firefox back button
[07:51:05] <lastent> cafaro, how can I append to and object? myObjec{} = {name : 'val1', lastname: 'val2'}}
[07:51:10] <jak> it loads page from internal cache
[07:51:20] <Aric> pachet: i would upload it to my webserver but i can't access it from behind this firewall atm
[07:51:27] <cafaro> lastent: myObject.foo = "bar"
[07:51:28] <Aric> pachet: so im working off local environment
[07:51:31] <pachet> ?.extend() @ lastent
[07:51:31] <bot-t> lastent, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:51:55] <jak> laanes ^^
[07:52:23] <jak> so, i cannot help, other than to tell you i spent hours trying to find a seemingly non-existant solution
[07:52:37] <jak> if you are luckier, or things have changed, let me know laanes!!
[07:52:44] <laanes> jak
[07:52:46] <laanes> $(window).unload(function() {});
[07:53:12] <jak> ??
[07:53:41] <jak> sorry, i meant when a page is loaded from firefox internal cache
[07:53:47] <jak> i may have misunderstood the issue
[07:55:13] <pachet> also @ lastent: what you originally posted (  {{property:'value', property2:'value'},{property4:'value'}}   )
[07:55:22] <pachet> isnt an object, because the properties are lacking identifiers
[07:55:44] <pachet> if you changed the outermost {}'s to [], you'd have an array
[07:55:47] <pachet> ;o
[08:01:56] <Aric> pachet: http://pastie.org/2617402 - alert() pops up the date i want, but the next line doesn't change the value... i am using .load() to put that input field into the DOM but JQuery should be able to index stuff that is only present after a load or does it only read the DOM at document.ready?
[08:02:44] <Aric> maybe JQuery doesnt see input[name="date"] because it is created the line above the .val() line to update it... do i need to fashion it inside another function somehow?
[08:09:24] <beakybal4> hi
[08:09:45] <beakybal4> how can i select a div with id 'derp' within the current div?
[08:10:20] <Brodingo> .find('#derp")
[08:10:22] <NodeX> Yay, just got round the age old problem of DOM's not being ready on newly cretaed elements from ajax requests and the lack of a second document.ready or some kind of document.is.ready chack
[08:11:26] <Brodingo> a second document ready?
[08:11:50] <NodeX> checking the added node has proper height/width etc etc
[08:12:21] <NodeX> for example sometimes you have to setTimeout before you can call a function that needs an element's width because it's not fully ready in teh DOM
[08:12:31] <NodeX> complete!=success
[08:12:37] <Aric> NodeX: how because i cant update content that only exists after AJAX and thats ot me stuck atm
[08:12:56] <Aric> an input field im trying to set after the form is posted inside a modal
[08:13:05] <NodeX> and $.post("",{},function(data) { //this DOES NOT USE SUCCESS!!)
[08:13:29] <NodeX> okay I';m gonna test it in other browsers a min
[08:13:38] <Aric> NodeX: http://pastie.org/2617402 - alert() pops up the date i want, but the next line doesn't change the value...
[08:13:43] <Brodingo> the hell
[08:14:43] <NodeX> but the concept is setup a global Jquery handler ajaxSuccess() and everytime an ajax request is processed make it loop an array and call the funcitons... on your ajax end (the script to respond) .. push anonymous funcitons to the array that you want executing when the DOM is ready
[08:15:02] <NodeX> atm it pollutes the window namespace but i'm working on using data instead
[08:15:19] <NodeX> but it's vokda time so no more till monday :D
[08:16:04] <Brodingo> yeah you get on that
[08:16:46] <NodeX> been plauging me all day
[08:17:28] <Brodingo> i meant the vodka
[08:17:34] <NodeX> heh
[08:19:00] <NodeX> FF and Chrome are go for launch, IE9 works
[08:19:16] <NodeX> ie8 = good to go
[08:19:34] <ajpiano> fyi no one knows what you're talking about :)
[08:20:14] <NodeX> Ok. when you do an ajax request and update an element wiht the response... lets says response has div id="foo" and you need the height of #foo
[08:20:55] <NodeX> if you are doing this from your ajax response then sometimes (not all the time) foo is not ready on the 3 parameter of $.post() os you have to delay / defer
[08:21:24] <NodeX> if you use $.ajax() widht success it's not an issue but shorthand is an issue
[08:21:37] <ajpiano> what are you on about
[08:21:43] <NodeX> I just explaiuned it
[08:21:45] <NodeX> etf
[08:21:46] <NodeX> wtf
[08:21:47] <ajpiano> $.post is a thin wrapper around $.ajax
[08:22:03] <ajpiano> the idea that something would work with $.ajax success and not with $.post success is mindboggling
[08:22:04] <NodeX> yes it is .... and you dont get success with it
[08:22:11] <ajpiano> uh, yes you do
[08:22:23] <NodeX> as the third parameter ??????
[08:22:27] <NodeX> I dont think so..
[08:22:28] <ajpiano> YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[08:22:32] <Brodingo> lol
[08:22:34] <ajpiano> ?$.post
[08:22:35] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:22:51] <NodeX> ok so why do my tests fail when $.post() but switch to $.ajax() with success and they work ??
[08:22:53] <ajpiano> success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)A callback function that is executed if the request succeeds.
[08:22:58] <ajpiano> i don't know
[08:23:06] <NodeX> beca\use it uses complete not success
[08:23:08] <NodeX> :)
[08:23:15] <Brodingo> ...
[08:23:28] <ajpiano> lol
[08:23:30] <ajpiano> no it doesn't
[08:23:32] <NodeX> if I use $.ajax with complete is does the same thing
[08:23:48] <NodeX> ok nps, I know it does but no probs
[08:23:58] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L281
[08:24:55] <Baribal> Hi. I'm a bit confused by .dialog; am I supposed to build dialogues in HTML or jQuery code? 'Cause some examples I've seen seem to mix those methods rather liberally.
[08:25:09] <ajpiano> Baribal: you are supposed to do what your use case dictates
[08:25:15] <ajpiano> sometimes you need to create it on the fly from brand new elements
[08:25:20] <ajpiano> other times you want to use an element in the DOM
[08:25:37] <Baribal> Okay. Use case says HTML, I think.
[08:27:12] <NodeX> my mistake, £().load() uses complete
[08:29:12] <pachet> ;[
[08:31:52] <pachet> Aric: sorry for the late response, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/K5CmV/
[08:32:11] <Baribal> NodeX, ()?
[08:32:35] <Baribal> Next one up after $ and  is the Yen sign? :)
[08:32:50] <Brodingo> naw, €()
[08:33:14] <NodeX> not on my keyboard
[08:38:51] <jaequery> wow i never knew moootools sucks so much balls
[08:39:07] <jaequery> i thought mootools can do everything jquery does and more (in an OOP) way, which is complete BS
[08:46:08] <Nasga> it is possible to catch en event when a node become visible (with .show()) without use a plugin ?
[08:46:36] <erichynds> Nasga: you could catch the event that makes that node visible
[08:47:28] <kborchers> Nasga: not sure what you're doing but why not just use the complete callback in show see ?show
[08:47:28] <bot-t> Nasga, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[08:48:20] <Nasga> i know this, but catch the event would be nicer than callback or exec in my code
[08:48:56] <ajpiano> is it really?
[08:49:06] <ajpiano> to catch events for things you yourself just did? rather than pass the callback initally?
[08:49:22] <Nasga> it is in my application ajpiano
[08:49:38] <ajpiano> obviously
[08:49:51] <Brodingo> is there a polite way to say your ignorant ajpiano
[08:49:53] <Nasga> i prefer even-driven than procedural
[08:50:24] <kborchers> instead of the back handed way you just did Brodingo ;)
[08:50:46] <ajpiano> Nasga: there's no event for when showing is complete.
[08:50:56] <ajpiano> that's why there's a callback
[08:51:52] <ajpiano> you could duckpunch .show() so that a callback is always passed that triggers the event and then you listen for the event
[08:52:16] <pachet> .trigger('clusterfuck')
[08:52:41] <ajpiano> ^^
[08:52:53] <kborchers> i love the clusterfuck event ... very useful
[08:53:48] <Nasga> nice way ajpiano :)
[08:54:00] <Nasga> thx a lot for this tips
[08:58:47] <jo__> when i use .append and i reload it dont stay on the site
[08:59:01] <jo__> any ideas?
[08:59:12] <jo__> anyone?
[08:59:23] <Brodingo> oh wow
[08:59:27] <pachet> that one actually hurts
[08:59:37] <vladikoff> jo__, Why would it stay?
[08:59:38] <ajpiano> jo__: why would you expect it to
[08:59:48] <biscazziere> hi, I have a jQuery element and a dinamically generated selector
[08:59:53] <jo__> well i dont
[09:00:03] <jo__> but how can i make it stay
[09:00:19] <biscazziere> I'd like to know if the selector I have matches that jquery element I have
[09:00:38] <ajpiano> biscazziere: use .is
[09:00:57] <ajpiano> somejQueryObject.is( "someselector" );
[09:02:19] <Martin_> can I create a map easily in JQuery ?
[09:02:27] <jo__> at my website i made an example
[09:02:49] <Brodingo> Martin_ what kind of map
[09:03:04] <Martin_> i am running concurrent uploads with XHR and I want to have a global progress bar... The xhr event returns bytesUploaded and totalBytes only. I need to store file --> bytesUploaded so I can work out the difference and increment the total bytes processed on my meter
[09:03:22] <Martin_> http://imgur.com/U35XH <- is an example of the xhr object
[09:03:25] <biscazziere> ajpiano: thanks, I'm trying. But how does jquery evaluate the is function? because my element is a particular p I've clicked on, but .is seems to match all the P
[09:03:46] <ajpiano> uh
[09:04:15] <ajpiano> it runs .filter("selector") on the element and sees if any of them match
[09:04:18] <Martin_> biscazziere: can you check e.target ?
[09:04:42] <ajpiano> Martin_: what does this have to do with creating a map?
[09:05:00] <Martin_> ajpiano: perhaps map isn't the correct word... I don't mean a geographical map
[09:05:02] <biscazziere> ajpiano: this is what I'm trying to achieve: the user click on a DOM element, then I traverse back the dom and I build a css selector, an array like this: ["ul", "> li:eq(0)", "ul", "> li:eq(0)", "a:icontains(sumitem 1)"]
[09:05:05] <Martin_> I mean an array map
[09:05:07] <ajpiano> do you mean... an array?
[09:05:21] <Martin_> std::map in c++
[09:05:23] <ajpiano> biscazziere: dynamically building selectors is a recipe for disaster
[09:05:58] <ajpiano> Martin_: you can ... make an object?
[09:06:02] <ajpiano> and put the values into it
[09:06:15] <biscazziere> ajpiano: then I'd like to remove redundant element from that array, to make the selector more concise, but only if after the pruning it selects the same starting element the user clicked on
[09:06:31] <ajpiano> biscazziere: what are you *actually trying to do*
[09:06:36] <Martin_> ajpiano: how can I track which object belongs to which file
[09:06:57] <biscazziere> ajpiano: an algorithm to determine a viable "minimized" css selector
[09:07:10] <ajpiano> why?
[09:07:20] <ajpiano> we've gone down that route in jquery core and it's fraught with #fail
[09:07:33] <ajpiano> trying to dynamically keep track of valid selector paths to an element
[09:07:34] <biscazziere> ajpiano: for a study
[09:08:00] <jo__> any alternative to .append that stays
[09:08:04] <ajpiano> Martin_: not sure
[09:08:14] <biscazziere> ajpiano: umg so you think it is not doable?
[09:08:20] <Brodingo> jo__ localStorage
[09:08:21] <ajpiano> jo__: there is no way to make adding something to your DOM persist it into your backend
[09:08:26] <Brodingo> BOOM
[09:08:38] <ajpiano> unless you use some approach where it will only stay on that one user's page, eg, localstorage, cookies, etc
[09:08:55] <ajpiano> biscazziere: i would certainly avoid it
[09:09:18] <ajpiano> Martin_: not sure, do you have multiple file uploads going on simultaneously?
[09:09:40] <biscazziere> ajpiano: thank you for your answers.
[09:09:41] <ravenzz> Martin_ just define an identifier for each upload
[09:09:52] <Martin_> ajpiano: yes I do have multiple concurrent uploads
[09:10:43] <jo__> ?localStorage
[09:10:44] <bot-t> jo__, localStorage | jQuery Plugins - I wrote a new, small, JQuery plugin which is quite easy to use. It's a menu which can be used with or without JQuery (if you dont want any js on your page, just get the css). http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/localstorage
[09:11:28] <biscazziere> ajpiano: given a selector, you think there is a way to know if it selects a specific DOM element (not just a P, but that P I've stored into a jquery object)
[09:11:37] <biscazziere> ?
[09:11:45] <ajpiano> biscazziere: that's what .is() is for
[09:11:52] <ajpiano> it will tell you if an element you already have matches a given selector
[09:11:57] <jo__> LOCALSTORAGEDB?
[09:12:08] <ajpiano> jo__: have you never heard of localStorage before?
[09:12:15] <ajpiano> ?mdc localStorage
[09:12:16] <bot-t> ajpiano, DOM Storage - MDN - DOM Storage is the name given to the set of storage-related features first introduced in the Web Applications 1.0 specification, and now split off into its own W3C Web Storage specification. DOM St... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage
[09:12:21] <jo__> nope
[09:13:19] <dabear> THEN I GUESS YOU MISSED OUT ON SOMETHING, MMKAY?
[09:14:04] <ajpiano> jo__: what are you appending that you want it to magically be there on the next page reload
[09:14:31] <jo__> well
[09:14:35] <jo__> can i link?
[09:14:53] <ajpiano> i guess
[09:15:01] <jo__> script9.net
[09:15:05] <jo__> i imported it
[09:15:27] <biscazziere> ajpiano: thanks, I think I was probably using .is the other way round. Now I'm calling it on the element, passing the selector as a param and it seems do to the job I wanted
[09:15:35] <Brodingo> ehhhhhh
[09:15:57] <ravenzz> strong markup btw
[09:16:15] <ajpiano> jo__, are you sure you don't need like... a backend... that actually stores these results?
[09:16:36] <jo__> well
[09:16:42] <jo__> its for a control panel
[09:17:07] <ajpiano> ah yes, the old "if it's 'for a control panel' you don't have to store it on the server" thing.
[09:18:34] <jo__> well
[09:18:35] <jo__> ?
[09:18:38] <jo__> yes i do
[09:18:57] <ravenzz> you can ask about localStorage on #html5
[09:19:02] <ravenzz> lol :D
[09:20:17] <Zitter> hi, i'm using JQuery.ajax to update dependant menus. Is it possible to add values to second dropdown menu, instead of substitute? I mean I have <option>Choose...</option> that I wouldn't remove from option's values
[09:21:02] <ajpiano> yes.... use append
[09:22:21] <kborchers> just keep in mind if you reload the appended options will not be there ;)
[09:22:27] <kborchers> sorry, couldn't resist from an earlier convo
[09:22:55] <Brodingo> hehehe
[09:23:34] <ravenzz> jo__ tip: you don't need to ask the user the youtube thumbnail url, you can retrieve it from the url. eg: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKPPMCbhz1g http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/yKPPMCbhz1g/default.jpg
[09:23:48] <jo__> how do i connect to another irc
[09:24:09] * Brodingo join #channel
[09:24:28] <Brodingo> that would be /join #channel
[09:24:30] <ravenzz> jo__ another network?
[09:28:03] <Martin_> Still stuck heh... Any pointers on how I can store all the files with their stats in an object?
[09:28:15] <Martin_> i've added a unique key per upload now but not sure how to store them
[09:28:19] <Martin_> JS always confuses me with the lack of arrays
[09:28:32] <ajpiano> Martin_: javascript has objects, use them
[09:28:41] <ajpiano> they work like associative arrays in most other languages
[09:28:49] <Martin_> so can I do say......
[09:28:52] <ajpiano> uploads[uniqueid] = entire.xhrObject
[09:28:55] <Martin_> var uploads = [];
[09:28:59] <ajpiano> no, var uploads = {};
[09:29:01] <ravenzz> this is
[09:29:02] <ravenzz> an array
[09:29:04] <ravenzz> ^
[09:29:14] <Martin_> ok.. and .push() is arrays only right ?
[09:29:18] <Martin_> can I push to an object?
[09:29:19] <ajpiano> yup
[09:29:22] <ajpiano> no you can't
[09:29:25] <ajpiano> you just add more keys in
[09:29:42] <ajpiano> i don't know if an array isn't necessarily the structure you need, but arrays don't have named keys, only numeric indices
[09:29:47] <Martin_> so how do I add { currentBytes:0, totalBytes:1000, time: 12312424 } into it ?
[09:29:50] <Martin_> and pull the relevant one?
[09:30:35] <ajpiano> Martin_: foo[ obj.uniqueId ] = obj;
[09:30:57] <Martin_> ah ok
[09:31:12] <Martin_> and then I can just grab foo[i].bytesUploaded ? or foo[i].bytesUploaded += n ?
[09:31:19] <ajpiano> yup
[09:32:46] <Martin_> great, as easy as that... Thanks guys
[09:37:32] <bakers> If I have domain.com and domain2.com can I call from the first one, ajax to the second to load foo.txt into a variable?

[09:46:06] <ravenzz> have fun
[09:48:38] <bakers> ravenzz: Something like this? http://www.fpaste.org/cE02/
[09:49:00] <ravenzz> yes
[09:49:00] <bakers> ravenzz: Would that allow me to remotely query that file?
[09:49:10] <ravenzz> but it would be better to allow just the 1st domain
[09:49:17] <ravenzz> instead of any domain
[09:50:01] <ravenzz> 1st domain = the one who are going to make the requests
[09:50:31] <bakers> ravenzz: Sweet that worked!
[09:50:40] <bakers> ravenzz: Can I say allow all requests from *.domain.com?

[09:57:23] <jacof> Hi. how would i act upon certain  element of class .sale_price that resides only as a children of the element in which the jquery is in itself
[09:57:34] <jacof> jQuery(this).children('.sales_price').remove()
[09:57:36] <jacof> is that ok ?
[09:59:01] <erichynds> jacof: yep
[09:59:38] <erichynds> jacof: if it's not a direct child, use find() instead
[09:59:51] <bakers> ravenzz: Is that not widely support by the browsers yet? The ONLY way I can get it to match is *
[10:00:09] <jacof> its not. the <script> tag is in a <p> element, and i got to go up until i find the wrapper, and then go down until i find the .sales_price.
[10:00:13] <ravenzz> did you put the http:// prefix
[10:00:13] <ravenzz> ?
[10:00:28] <jacof> i'm using parents(div.content).children(.sale_price). how would find() be?
[10:00:30] <jacof> erichynds:
[10:00:42] <bakers> ravenzz: I did *.com domain.com *.domain.com
[10:00:52] <erichynds> jacof: do closest(".content").find(".sale_price")
[10:01:00] <bakers> ravenzz: the only one that works is the exact domain http://www.domain.com and *
[10:01:21] <erichynds> jacof: find() also lets you be a little more flexible with your DOM structure in the event that it changes later on
[10:01:22] <jacof> erichynds: the issue is that there are a lot of products in the page, and I want to remove sale_price only for the one that has the javascript snippet
[10:01:33] <ravenzz> bakers i mean header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://*.domain.com");
[10:01:41] <jacof> does that support such a condition
[10:01:41] <erichynds> jacof: what do you mean 'has the javascript snippet' ?
[10:02:00] <bakers> ravenzz: no go
[10:02:13] <jacof> erichynds: I'll add the jQuery snippet to certain products that I'll want to sanitize and remove the "sales_price" tag.
[10:02:22] <bakers> ravenzz: header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.domain.com"); works though
[10:02:29] <jacof> if the jquery is not there, nothing happens. if jQuery is there, the sale_price is removed.
[10:02:41] <jacof> that's why I need it to act only inside the boundaries of a certain container div
[10:02:56] <bakers> I'm wondering if it's a browser thing?
[10:03:00] <Dave_Stein> jacof: why are you using jquery to remove sales price tag on a page? wouldnt it just not show up cause its not on sale via server side?
[10:03:12] <erichynds> jacof: the snippet I gave you is still applicable then
[10:03:18] <jacof> Dave_Stein: long story..
[10:03:31] <Dave_Stein> ha ok
[10:03:34] <jjjrmy> Anyone wanna help?
[10:03:46] <Dave_Stein> jacof: i think erichynds is right
[10:03:49] <Dave_Stein> jjjrmy just ask
[10:03:50] <jacof> erichynds: find("") searches downwards ?
[10:03:56] <Dave_Stein> jacof: yes
[10:03:57] <erichynds> jacof: yes
[10:04:02] <Dave_Stein> :)
[10:04:02] <jacof> ok. thank you very much
[10:04:09] <jjjrmy> I need a Twitter fed on my site
[10:04:10] <jjjrmy> with jquery
[10:04:12] <jjjrmy> how do I do it?
[10:04:32] <Dave_Stein> jjjrmy you dont use jquery for that
[10:04:44] <jjjrmy> how? other tahn PHP
[10:04:46] <jjjrmy> *than
[10:04:54] <erichynds> sure you can
[10:04:57] <Dave_Stein> jjjrmy i'm pretty certain they have a javascript tag you can add on your page
[10:05:10] <jjjrmy> I will pay you $5 to make it for me
[10:05:24] <jjjrmy> I just want each tweet as an li in a ul
[10:06:06] <Dave_Stein> not sure how to do that offhand, my coworker is the one who got twtitter on our site and im pretty sure we use the PHP method
[10:06:45] <ajpiano> jjjrmy: see ?g tweets with jquery

[10:07:02] <ajpiano> jjjrmy: offering someone $5 to do a coding task is, what's the word, insulting
[10:07:13] <jjjrmy> it probably takes 5 minutes
[10:07:14] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: correct

[10:07:24] <bot-t> jjjrmy, Twitter - http://twitter.com/
[10:07:26] <Dave_Stein> jjjrmy people in this room come with code samples and ask for help. no one here writes code for whatever
[10:08:05] <ajpiano> jjjrmy: there is an abundance of information on how to use jquery to fetch tweets using jquery
[10:08:06] <jjjrmy> aahhh
[10:08:13] <jjjrmy> do it for me
[10:08:15] <ajpiano> please do some research and try to implement one yourself
[10:08:15] <Dave_Stein> ?google
[10:08:15] <jjjrmy> I don't know jquery
[10:08:15] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Google - http://www.google.com/
[10:08:19] <Dave_Stein> lol
[10:08:20] <jjjrmy> I could do it in HPP so fast
[10:08:28] <jjjrmy> PHP
[10:08:38] <ajpiano> no one is going to "do it for you"
[10:08:42] <Dave_Stein> jjjrmy why dont you take ajpiano's advice and visit the link he sent you
[10:08:49] <jjjrmy> $5
[10:08:50] <ajpiano> keep up that attitude and you'll be headed out
[10:09:18] <jjjrmy> can someone help wit h the sea of cluds links?
[10:09:33] <jjjrmy> this
[10:09:34] <jjjrmy> http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/
[10:09:37] <jjjrmy> how do I set it up?
[10:09:48] <ajpiano> have you ever used a jquery plugin before?
[10:10:00] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: so that plugin is just wrapping around twitter's poo?
[10:10:00] <ajpiano> we're not going to walk you through basics of "using any javascript on your web site" right now
[10:10:10] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: i guess... i just found it 3 minuites ago
[10:10:17] <Dave_Stein> exactly why i did ?google haha
[10:10:32] <erichynds> jjjrmy: http://jsfiddle.net/PqSDQ/
[10:10:34] <erichynds> take it from there..
[10:10:38] <jjjrmy> no
[10:10:50] <jacof> any idea why this is not working if all the classes are correct?  jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery(this).closest(".content").find(".sale_price").remove(); });
[10:10:50] <erichynds> i retract my fiddle
[10:11:14] <ajpiano> jjjrmy: try looking at the link, he already did 90% of the work
[10:11:37] <Dave_Stein> jacof: 'this' is the document there and then closest is going all the way up to nowhere
[10:11:39] <ajpiano> erichynds: that's a sexy little miniature templating thing you do there
[10:11:49] <erichynds> :p
[10:11:54] <erichynds> i can't stand string concat'ing
[10:12:12] <jacof> oh.
[10:12:17] <jacof> so what should I use.
[10:12:19] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: that is nice ha see i didnt think a jquery plugin was even needed
[10:12:19] <ajpiano> it told me the same thing about you, jerk
[10:12:20] <jacof> just jQuery. ?
[10:12:39] <Dave_Stein> jacof: how do you know if its a product you wanna remove the tag for?
[10:13:43] <Dave_Stein> jacof: it seems backwards you trying to traverse up only to go back down
[10:14:07] <jacof> Dave_Stein: the idea is to have a javascript snippet that when placing in the product description, it will go and replace the href="" action of the "View Details" button, change its text, and remove the pricing, turning it into a non product.
[10:14:45] <jacof> so I need to find the closest p.sale_price to the relative location of the snippet itself.
[10:14:51] <jacof> I don't even know if that's possible... ?
[10:14:53] <jaequery> mootools is a POS
[10:15:11] <jaequery> i cant believe how crappy it is
[10:15:15] <Dave_Stein> jacof: i don't think so
[10:15:21] <jjjrmy> I went to the link
[10:15:24] <jjjrmy> it doesn't work
[10:15:28] <Dave_Stein> jacof: how is the script getting added?
[10:15:35] <Dave_Stein> jacof: is the PHP implanting the script?
[10:15:37] <Dave_Stein> PHP/serv
[10:15:47] <jacof> Dave_Stein: No, manually in the text description.
[10:16:10] <jacof> Well It can be a special div, or html tag insted of a script, and have a jquery replace them all at one.
[10:16:11] <jacof> once.
[10:16:22] <code-shah> hey guys, if I call jquery.ajax do I have to do something special if the url is on a different domain?
[10:16:29] <jacof> that would solve my relativity probelm
[10:17:05] <Dave_Stein> so you have like 10 products in the db, each with a description where you want to add a snippet
[10:17:16] <Dave_Stein> and like 3 of them might need to remove the tag
[10:17:32] <Dave_Stein> does each product description have an HTML ID in some way that maps to the product id?
[10:17:48] <jacof> Dave_Stein: The objective is that my client may at any time add this snippet into the text description and change the product type with it.
[10:18:01] <jacof> unfortunately no
[10:18:02] <Dave_Stein> jacof: you're not gonna be able to get a universal snippet that way
[10:18:21] <jacof> looks like it.
[10:18:23] <Dave_Stein> jacof: yeah you seem pretty screwed without being able to edit the markup cause otherwise you'll target a class and just remove them all
[10:18:35] <Dave_Stein> jacof: a snippet doesn't know where it is in the DOM, as far as I know
[10:18:36] <ajpiano> lol using javacript inside of a blob text field to "set the data type"
[10:19:07] <jacof> Dave_Stein: but I can have a <div class="something"> added to the text, replacing the "snippet"
[10:19:16] <jacof> and then have jQuery act on all of the .something that finds in the page
[10:19:22] <Dave_Stein> haha i see what youre saying now
[10:19:28] <Dave_Stein> that is crazy but yeah
[10:19:34] <Dave_Stein> if you had your client put into the text field
[10:19:44] <jo__> make .append stay on site
[10:19:59] <Dave_Stein> <div class="remove-price"></div><script type="text/javascript">$('.remove-price').closest('.content').find('.tag').remove();</script>
[10:20:09] <jacof> I'll just tell him its not possble.
[10:20:13] <Dave_Stein> jacof: although that is horrible
[10:20:25] <jacof> i'm pretty screwed without being able to modify the code already
[10:20:34] <Dave_Stein> yup
[10:20:39] <jacof> I'm not comfortable making this in jquery
[10:21:02] <jacof> bsides its going to get all flickery
[10:21:13] <ajpiano> jo__: please stop asking that
[10:21:18] <bakers> ravenzz: Any idea if Chrome supports that at all? I'm getting denied even with * in Chrome and Opera
[10:21:23] <bakers> ravenzz: FF is the only one working
[10:21:46] <Dave_Stein> i saw origin stuff before, are you talking about iframes or ajax stuff?
[10:22:06] <jo__> noone=
[10:22:07] <Dave_Stein> bakers: when i was working on cross-domain iframe crap i remember that webkit browsers were more strict about accepting origin
[10:22:08] <jo__> ?
[10:22:23] <bakers> Dave_Stein: Oh yeah? I can't get them to take it at ALL
[10:22:26] <Dave_Stein> bakers: there was some extra argument that was optional in FF
[10:22:34] <Dave_Stein> bakers: are you talking about an iframe or AJAX tho?
[10:23:00] <bakers> Dave_Stein: AJAX
[10:23:27] <Dave_Stein> never pulled off cross domain ajax but i'd suggest look at docs for Safari, that's where I found my answer last time
[10:23:31] <Dave_Stein> for iframe origin stuff
[10:24:06] <Dave_Stein> lunch time
[10:26:26] <bencc> how can I create a new ui widget that extends ui.tabs?
[10:26:35] <bencc> I've found this: https://gist.github.com/962848
[10:26:52] <ajpiano> bencc: $.widget("your.tabbers", $.ui.tabs, {});
[10:27:05] <bencc> ajpiano: trying. thanks
[10:27:15] <ajpiano> but that will create it as $("#foo").tabbers();
[10:27:41] <cnnr> what's the best way to bind an event to when a checkbox is checked? .change(), then throw a conditional to see if it's checked?
[10:27:52] <ajpiano> bencc: you can use $.widget.bridge to set what lives on $.fn : http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide21
[10:28:14] <bencc> ajpiano:  what wrong with $("#foo").tabbers(); ?
[10:28:27] <ajpiano> nothing
[10:28:31] <ajpiano> unless you wanted it to be .tabs()
[10:28:50] <ajpiano> in which case you could do $.widget.bridge("tabs", $.your.tabbers));
[10:28:52] <ajpiano> -)
[10:29:32] <bencc> ajpiano: I can live with an ugly name :)
[10:29:38] <ajpiano> you don't have to
[10:29:38] <ajpiano> :)
[10:30:04] <bencc> I just don't understand why jqueryui strips all the useful functions in each release
[10:30:24] <bencc> there are no functions to get selected tab and update his body div
[10:30:28] <bencc> that's strange
[10:30:37] <ajpiano> what
[10:31:01] <ajpiano> you can do that so easily
[10:31:11] <ajpiano> you can do it in the select callback...
[10:32:01] <ajpiano> and that wasn't "stripped out"
[10:32:02] <bencc> what if you want to do this afterwards?
[10:32:04] <ajpiano> there has never been a method it
[10:32:29] <ajpiano> bencc: you can set a class on the active tab using the select callback, or obtain the active tab through a variety of other ways
[10:32:41] <ajpiano> and then just do $(thatTab).html();
[10:32:52] <bencc> if I want to call the super function I should do: $.ui.tabs.prototpye._create(this, arguments) ?
[10:33:08] <ajpiano> yes, in 1.8 that's how you gotta do it
[10:33:52] <bencc> thanks
[10:34:07] <danzik17> anyone know if any of the jquery conf sessions will be up on youtube/elsewhere at some point?
[10:34:17] <bencc> there are ways to accomplish anything but that's require alot of work
[10:34:38] <ajpiano> bencc: if you consider writing a single event handler and adding a class, "a lot of work" then yeah
[10:34:52] <ajpiano> it's a lot of work
[10:35:29] <bencc> ajpiano: it's not that. every functionality I need is missing
[10:35:43] <bencc> ajpiano: for example, there is no track on the number of tabs
[10:35:50] <ajpiano> bencc: it's a generic ui component, we can't guess every piece of funcionality that every user could need -
[10:35:51] <bencc> ajpiano: you should create tab ids manually
[10:35:58] <ajpiano> that said there are some clumsinesses in the tabs api
[10:36:17] <ajpiano> bencc http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/tabs-api-redesign/
[10:36:56] <bencc> ajpiano: maybe I was spoiled with this: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/ext-4.0.2a/examples/tabs/tabs-adv.html
[10:37:03] <bencc> I saw the redesign
[10:37:12] <ajpiano> bencc: granted
[10:37:19] <ajpiano> if you're used to ext/sencha style widgets...
[10:37:35] <ajpiano> jquery ui is not that
[10:38:02] <bencc> ajpiano: ext has it's problems too but the api is very good
[10:38:34] <bencc> the good news are that I'm trying to move to jquery-ui now :)
[10:40:05] <ajpiano> :)
[10:40:18] <ajpiano> bencc, we have a pretty different mentaility in UI
[10:40:38] <ajpiano> trying not to guess every feature everyone could ever want, but instead providing extensible, evented base
[10:41:07] <snover> the different mentality in UI is “LET’S DOM EVERYTHING” I think :)
[10:41:23] <pachet> ;]
[10:41:25] <snover> (I hate jQuery UI)
[10:41:26] <bencc> ajpiano:  are there plans to add functionality to create widgets dynamically
[10:41:33] <snover> (widgets aren’t dom elements)
[10:41:35] <bencc> ajpiano:  maybe even nested widgets with layouts
[10:41:44] <ajpiano> ?iszak @ snover
[10:41:45] <bot-t> snover, http://bit.ly/9ssjmq
[10:41:55] <snover> ajpiano: I have legitimate grievances with it. :P
[10:42:02] <ajpiano> bencc: you mean like, templated widgets a-la dojo?
[10:42:22] <bencc> ajpiano: If dojo is like yui and ext than yest
[10:42:42] <bencc> ajpiano: it allows you to define nested widgets in json and create them dynamically
[10:42:51] <ajpiano> yeah, we don't have plans for that at the moment
[10:42:57] <bencc> and they layout managers handle sizing for you
[10:43:11] <bencc> that will be a killer feature
[10:43:29] <ajpiano> that's obviously not to say that you can't "create widgets dynamically" but it's considerably less like, auomated experience than some of the other ui libs
[10:44:38] <snover> bencc: You need more than jQuery can provide :)
[10:50:21] <ccmonsters> hola folks.
[10:51:36] <Nathaniel_> Hey, say I attach an event listener with $('*').mousedown(function(e) { ... });, is there anyway I can remove that specific event listener? If I did $('*').die('mousedown') it would remove ALL mousedown event listeners
[10:51:48] <Elephant> hola!
[10:52:10] <bencc> ajpiano: this part is what bothers me: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/demos/tabs/manipulation.html#L64
[10:52:15] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: you can either bind with a namespaced handler or unbind witha  function reference
[10:52:34] <bencc> ajpiano: in my opinion it's standard enough to be implemented in the widget
[10:53:14] <ajpiano> bencc: there are so many plausible ways that a use could possibly want to create the new tab on the fly
[10:53:24] <ajpiano> that just having them add it to the original dom structure is a lot more reasonable imo
[10:53:38] <bencc> ajpiano: that's not an api
[10:53:52] <bencc> ajpiano: it's just manually doing what the lib should do for you
[10:54:10] <bencc> I don't want to know anything about the header link
[10:54:24] <bencc> I just want a new tab with a title, index, and a div for content
[10:54:29] <snover> bencc: jquery has a hard time with the idea of thinking about things as components, not DOM elements
[10:54:39] <ajpiano> the API is build basic elements, then we enhance them
[10:54:45] <bencc> but that's jquery-ui not jquery
[10:54:55] <ajpiano> build more basic elements, and then we enhance them... isn't unreasonable
[10:55:06] <bencc> it is
[10:55:23] * ajpiano telephones reasonableness police
[10:55:33] <bencc> instead of tabs.add(contentEl, [id], [href])
[10:55:36] <bencc> done :)
[10:55:41] <pachet> just write that in
[10:55:42] <pachet> jeez
[10:55:42] <snover> bencc: I would really suggest looking at dojo instead of jquery.
[10:55:48] <Nathaniel_> ajpiano, how would I get a reference for the handler on-the-fly?
[10:55:52] <bencc> snover: stop it already
[10:55:53] <snover> I think you will find it is much more reasonable for what you want to do.
[10:55:57] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: don't use an anonymous function already
[10:56:02] <ajpiano> bencc: i agree w/ snover
[10:56:15] <snover> jQuery simply has different goals.
[10:56:19] <snover> and that’s fine.
[10:56:24] <snover> but don’t expect it to be what it isn’t.
[10:56:25] <bencc> ajpiano: dojo isn't well accepted
[10:56:39] <bencc> ajpiano: dojo won't survive
[10:56:45] <ajpiano> bencc: plenty of people use dojo and it is a perfectly reasonable thing
[10:56:45] <ajpiano> ok
[10:56:58] <ajpiano> if you say so
[10:57:08] <bencc> who is using dojo?
[10:57:12] <ajpiano> snover's a committer
[10:57:14] <ajpiano> lol
[10:57:31] <Nathaniel_> Ugh I love anonymous functions, is there no way to get a reference?
[10:57:33] <ajpiano> bencc: all the people who went to dojoconf two weeks ago though
[10:57:34] <bencc> ning used dojo and switched to jquery
[10:58:07] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: it's a lot better to use named functions if you need to work with those functions
[10:58:09] <ajpiano> that's the whole point
[10:58:20] <Nathaniel_> I know
[10:58:40] <Nathaniel_> But is there no way?
[10:59:01] <ajpiano> there is no way
[10:59:33] <Nathaniel_> ugh ffs
[10:59:38] <ajpiano> lol
[10:59:44] <ajpiano> sorry that you have to organise your code
[11:00:06] <Nathaniel_> It's just easier to use anonymous functions
[11:00:22] <ajpiano> in what way is it easier
[11:00:29] <snover> it’s easier to kill yourself than it is to get up every day too
[11:00:56] <Nathaniel_> Because I don't need another variable to keep track of its scope
[11:01:07] <Nathaniel_> I mean
[11:01:19] <Nathaniel_> I don't want to have to keep track of another variables scope
[11:01:23] <ajpiano> lol
[11:01:53] <pachet_> damn, snover might be on to something there
[11:02:42] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: the func ref can be local to wherever you are, you don't have to "keep track of it"
[11:03:05] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: apparently we use this twitter wrapper: https://github.com/jmathai/twitter-async
[11:03:49] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: you should probably instead keep track of whether or not it is really a good idea to bind a mousedown handler to every single element in the dom
[11:04:01] <Elephant> yeah what on earth
[11:04:12] <Dave_Stein> back to work, just wanted to pass you that for future ref
[11:04:16] <ajpiano> cool Dave_Stein
[11:04:22] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: are you coming to jqcon this weekdn
[11:04:26] <Nathaniel_> ajpiano, that was just an example, it is actually the mousemove event for a drag and drop thing
[11:04:45] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: nah im busy with family for holiday today, relaxing tomorrow, then skydiving sunday
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> Nathaniel_: the idea that you'd construct a drag-and-drop system using nothing but anonymous functions is truly frightening
[11:05:04] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i looked at topics and dont know how much i'd gain going. i may be going ot jsconf us in the future.
[11:05:27] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: heh, whoever picked the talks must be a real dummy
[11:05:31] <ajpiano> <-- it was me
[11:05:34] <Dave_Stein> lol
[11:05:35] <_tim> hey guys. any idea why line 14 in the code snippet causes jqueryui selectable and tabs to not react on events? http://pastebin.com/NCxgwaES
[11:06:00] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: they were fine topics, but considering im in here all the time and helping people with jquery and use it 24/7 im not sure how much there is for me to learn
[11:06:18] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: jasmine sitll interests me, but i can always bug you aobut that later or ask the pivotal guys cause they are quite responsive
[11:06:27] <ajpiano> heh yeah i know the feeling...
[11:06:31] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: also, more importantly, its your turn
[11:06:32] <ajpiano> good time to come up and meet the whole crew though
[11:06:38] <ajpiano> there'll be amlpe opportunity though i'm sure
[11:06:44] <ajpiano> tru
[11:07:04] <ajpiano> meh, you got the deathblow
[11:07:06] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: yeah i think ill def want to meet the team in the future, after i've done a bit more than one commit
[11:07:14] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i should be working more on ui on saturday
[11:07:41] <nylinuxhelp> hi all. on a SELECT element in jquery mobile, i'm trying to restyle the first selected option, and I can do it using optionClass.css("color", "red") - but, you don't see this until you actually give the select element focus. Any ideas?
[11:07:45] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: go the letter X
[11:08:13] <ajpiano> heh yeah
[11:08:53] <Dave_Stein> ok really back to work time
[11:09:23] <ajpiano> haha X saved yo life
[11:09:29] <ajpiano> later
[11:11:12] <Elephant> nylinuxhelp: bring focus to it on the change, and the unfocus?
[11:11:21] <Elephant> s/the/then/
[11:23:08] <Kre10s__> is it possible to stop a $.each( function from continuing?
[11:23:17] <ajpiano> return false;
[11:23:19] <Kre10s__> nm...
[11:49:18] <_tim> hey guys. any idea why line 14 in the code snippet causes jqueryui selectable and tabs to not react on events? http://pastebin.com/NCxgwaES
[12:00:33] <rroelofs> _tim:  is that a joke?
[12:04:19] <benji31> Hi, is there a way to get an array made of the values of the options in a select ?
[12:04:23] <bakers> ravenzz: You still here?
[12:05:20] <bakers> benji31: Sure use $("#select > option").each(function() { array.push($(this).val(); });
[12:05:50] <bakers> benji31: http://www.perturb.org/display/1003_JQuery_map_items_into_an_array.html
[12:05:58] <benji31> thanks!
[12:05:59] <erichynds> benji31: var values = $("#select option").map(function(){ return this.value; }).get()
[12:07:24] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: do you need get?
[12:07:31] <erichynds> yeah
[12:07:35] <erichynds> otherwise it'll be a jquery object
[12:07:42] <erichynds> which isn't what you want
[12:08:06] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: weird firebug isnt showing it as a jquery obj without .... oh wait... im at my parents house without firequery haha
[12:08:07] <bakers> erichynds: Couldn't you return $(this).val()
[12:08:17] <Dave_Stein> bakers: that returns the selected value
[12:08:23] <erichynds> bakers: if it's a multiple select, that returns an array of selected values
[12:09:00] <bakers> erichynds: Depends on your selector, I assumed you'd select each <option> then pull out the val()
[12:09:10] <erichynds> bakers: that's what I did
[12:09:34] <Dave_Stein> i made a shortcut function that like Prototype ha so $.fn.pluck is equal to the lines ercihynds did
[12:09:41] <Dave_Stein> that's a common thing i need
[12:09:45] <Dave_Stein> for not just value, but any attribute
[12:10:18] <pachet> pluck, cute name ;D
[12:10:20] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: is map internally just a wrapper for eaching through and adding to array?
[12:10:32] <Dave_Stein> pachet: its the name of the function in prototype i used to use in my dark days without jquery
[12:10:33] <erichynds> Dave_Stein: yeah. it returns a new array
[12:11:06] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: so considering i hvae a shortcut function already, i should stick to using $.each to avoid an extra function call?
[12:11:19] <erichynds> huh?
[12:11:22] <erichynds> I would use map
[12:11:40] <erichynds> it's purpose is to do exactly what you're doing - return a new function
[12:11:41] <pachet> Dave_Stein: oh gotcha. was never big into prototype :o
[12:11:44] <erichynds> eer array
[12:11:55] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: $.map isn't a wrapper around $.each
[12:11:55] <Dave_Stein> ah let me show you what i mean
[12:12:06] <erichynds> also, 1 extra fn call isn't going to kill anyone :p
[12:12:06] <Dave_Stein> oh it goes to the native map then?
[12:12:25] <ajpiano> no it is just a for/for in loop
[12:12:35] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[12:12:38] <ajpiano> it also flattens nested arrays
[12:14:04] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/W4gsz/
[12:14:06] <Dave_Stein> that's what i use
[12:15:07] <Dave_Stein> i went on a tangent, doing what that guy needed with values, but with any attribute
[12:16:35] <Dave_Stein> is it that crazy you went silent? :)
[12:16:48] <ajpiano> im also eating a turkey drumstick
[12:16:56] <Dave_Stein> ha
[12:17:08] <pachet> and riding a unicycle atop a flaming bear's back
[12:17:24] <Dave_Stein> pachet: stop lying, it's just mean
[12:18:00] <Dave_Stein> offtopic: logmein  sucks, it keeps thinkimg im right clicking and then i have to leave full sreen mode to just to fix it
[12:18:13] <pachet> :(
[12:18:55] <Dave_Stein> ?js ( typeof "bored" == true )
[12:18:55] <bot-t> Dave_Stein: false
[12:19:16] <Dave_Stein> oh man loose matching worked the way it should for once
[12:19:18] <Dave_Stein> haha
[12:29:41] <realpap> any idea why this nivo slider works buggy? http://realpap.byethost14.com/slier.html
[12:30:04] <realpap> i tried jquery latest, 1.5.2 and now 1.5.0, removed all options from the function and still shows buggy
[12:31:19] <Dave_Stein> that looks like css issue
[12:31:34] <Dave_Stein> upon first glance
[12:32:10] <Dave_Stein> but it does look like everything is getting top 0 inside relative
[12:32:15] <realpap> but there is almost no css
[12:32:42] <Dave_Stein> realpap: im not sure but you can try slowing down the animation to painfully slow and checking firebug to see why things would be veritcallya ligned incorrectly
[12:33:29] <realpap> ok
[12:35:16] <Whirl3d> hey all, using jQueryUI, how do I add a simple close button to a div?
[12:37:09] <realpap> i dont know what to look in firebug, the html?
[12:38:19] <realpap> i removed the png and still fails
[12:38:45] <Dave_Stein> realpap: yaeh i usually look at HTML and see what the css is thats changing
[12:38:49] <Dave_Stein> its just super hard in an animation
[12:38:56] <Dave_Stein> but it could just be the plugin in the end, dunno , never used it
[12:39:07] <Dave_Stein> WHirl3d what are you trying to close? do you mean just hide an element?
[12:44:42] <_tim> hey guys. any idea why line 14 in the code snippet causes jqueryui selectable and tabs to not react on events? http://pastebin.com/NCxgwaES
[12:45:05] <dabear> _tim: yep
[12:45:24] <dabear> you are setting the innerhtml of the entire body
[12:45:32] <dckur> someone here worked with cleeditor?
[12:45:42] <dabear> that will remove all elements from body, then recreate them, _tim
[12:45:56] <dabear> _tim: so don't do that
[12:46:02] <dabear> ?ask @ dckur
[12:46:02] <bot-t> dckur, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:46:49] <dckur> I have a strange bug with CLEditor, when I put it inside a div, it freaks out ;-)  when I do show hide source, look here http://dckur.dyndns.org/report.html
[12:47:17] <dckur> push on show hide source on the editor, and you will see that something goes wrong
[12:48:05] <dckur> not sure if this is my bug or their
[12:48:12] <_tim> dabear however.. this is done on "onLoad" and the selectable and tabs are created later on..?
[12:50:16] <dabear> _tim: that might not be the case, but I need to see code to know.. Also, replacing the innerhtml of body is a *really* bad idea to begin with.
[12:50:43] <_tim> yeah, indeed. i didn't write this fuckin' language system :D
[12:50:49] <_tim> no chance to put it an other
[12:50:49] <dabear> replacing innerhtml of any elements *will* brake *any* event listener inside that element
[12:51:53] <dabear> _tim: WHY are you doing this on the client side? language translation should happen on the server
[12:52:00] <_tim> dabear, the really complete code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/3x7kz/ , the document.body.innerHtml is in global.js line 33, jquery things are in html
[12:52:06] <dabear> free of any client side event listeners
[12:52:28] <snover> dabear: uh, no?
[12:52:28] <_tim> dabear, yeah.. i took this code over. wasn't me he failed :<
[12:52:39] <snover> I mean
[12:52:54] <snover> yes that just trying to clobber entire elements using innerhtml bad
[12:52:55] <dabear> snover: eh, yes
[12:53:04] <snover> no that language translation should be done on the server
[12:53:32] <dabear> obviously I do not agree to that
[12:54:00] <dabear> having the server push out pre-translated content is an obvious win
[12:54:02] <Cameron> hello
[12:54:06] <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/RedFox/index.html
[12:54:08] <coffeecup> i've a list of div containers which i would use the selectable() functionality on, when using selectable() on the element where my div containers are in all events of the childrens dont bubble anymore, any ideas how i could retrigger the event so this bubbles up correctly?
[12:54:13] <Cameron> why doesnt that banner work properly?
[12:54:36] <Cameron> when you click a button it jumps back to the first one at the end of the slide
[12:55:39] <Whirl3d> Dave_Stein, sorry for the delay. I am having a problem with understanding the jQueryUI css. I can get the logic to work, but getting the little close icon to appear on an anchor isn't working
[12:56:11] <dabear> snover: I do not see anyone ever changing languages that frequently, so there is no need to have language switching on the client side, just to save a trip to the server that single time
[12:56:24] <Dave_Stein> Whirl3d ohh you're using a theme, i don't use that but i'd just check that you have images installed in right place - easy to check in firebug when you mouseover element
[12:57:02] <Whirl3d> Yeah, they are there. I just don't know which combination of classes needs to be added to make it work.
[12:57:27] <snover> dabear: wut. how about if *the display is built on the client*.
[12:58:54] <dabear> you mean like if it's an "app"? sure, but I don't see novices building apps, nor replacing innerhtml on body:p
[12:59:08] <vyz> Hello, I have the following technical question: Does the jquery do post over xdomains? And how?
[13:01:05] <_tim> dabear, that is so logical. but now i need to find a way to go around that or i have to set jquery aside :S
[13:01:18] <_tim> too much work to change the whole language system
[13:02:46] <dabear> _tim: can't you somehow read the document contents *before* it's added to the DOM, e.g. like a middleware, and then push the altered contents into the DOM instead
[13:02:47] <dabear> ?
[13:04:39] <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/RedFox/index.html
[13:04:42] <Cameron> why doesnt that banner work properly?
[13:04:44] <Cameron> when you click a button it jumps back to the first one at the end of the slide
[13:05:53] <_tim> dabear: of course i can, since the lang keys are in the database and a php script is processed anyways. but i have to change the template engine to do so, which is approximately as complex as the language system :D the previous developers did EVERYTHING on their own
[13:06:01] <_tim> no standardized solutions :<
[13:08:14] <subsume> Can someone explain why loading jquery through googleapis doesn't work in IE?
[13:08:19] <subsume> I get "Access is denied"
[13:08:37] <_tim> dabear: so my problem simply is: time ;<
[13:10:24] <Dr4g> Guys, i have images already in the DOM. when you click the image it adds it to a list of "small thumbnails" of the original images.
[13:10:29] <Whirl3d> One last try: Could someone explain which classes from the jQueryUI CSS Theme's need to be added to make a "close button"
[13:10:38] <ravenzz> ?demo @ subsume
[13:10:38] <bot-t> subsume, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:10:46] <Dr4g> Guys, i have images already in the DOM. when you click the image it adds it to a list of "small thumbnails" of the original images. - Is the only way to .clone() the element and resize it? or is there a better way.
[13:11:38] <ravenzz> Dr4g you could grab the src and create a new img
[13:11:54] <Dr4g> that means a new http request
[13:12:12] <Dr4g> and i'm trying to avoid having to re-load the image again, but just resize the existing loaded guy
[13:12:16] <playa> Hi, I have a couple of questions. First, I am using script jquery.wysiwyg to edit the content of some div elements on my page. It works good, but it adds some divs to my html. I need to output the whole HTML after editing, and I use autput = $('.kostur').html(); to get the output HTML. Can I somehow "clean" the code from the <div class='w'> that this wysiwyg script adds before I output ? Here's the live example of it, http://www.tkmediana
[13:13:28] <Whirl3d> playa, not a valid url
[13:13:54] <playa> Im sure it is, I can open it with dblclick
[13:14:05] <Elephant> .tkmediana is not a valid top level domain.
[13:14:12] <vyz> Hello, I have the following technical question: Does the jquery do post over xdomains? And how?
[13:14:13] <Whirl3d> for some reason, the .com isn't on there
[13:14:24] <playa> add . com at the end please
[13:14:27] <playa> wait
[13:14:36] <playa> can I tinyurl it ?
[13:14:59] <playa> http://tinyurl.com/6xrz6sz
[13:15:16] <playa> working ?
[13:15:40] <Whirl3d> got it. It looks good, but where do you edit it?
[13:16:08] <playa> just click on any text and type. I need to add some style, although
[13:16:23] <playa> click save to see the output. I don't need those .w divs
[13:16:44] <Whirl3d> doesn't work for me. (the clicking and editing thing)
[13:16:54] <playa> only tested in ff so far
[13:17:30] <Whirl3d> I am using chrome, but I don't see where you included the wysiwyg plugin.
[13:18:18] <playa> here's the screenshot of it, maybe it will help http://prntscr.com/39sqr
[13:18:51] <Whirl3d> how funny, the page I was looking at is nothing like that. LOL
[13:19:02] <dabear> _tim: these L_foo  placeholders, do they appear only in text? i.e. not inside the tag definitiion itself (<div here>or here?</div)
[13:19:13] <Whirl3d> I was looking at: http://tkmediana.com/index-en.php
[13:19:43] <playa> tkmediana (dot) com (slash) delovi (slash) kostur32.html
[13:20:20] <Whirl3d> try using $.unwrap
[13:20:26] <Whirl3d> ? .unwrap
[13:20:26] <bot-t> .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[13:20:53] <playa> ok, never used it before, I will google it, thank you
[13:21:03] <playa> and my other question is, how can I save this output to file ?
[13:21:16] <playa> I suppose Ajax, but I don't have any clue about it
[13:21:32] <Whirl3d> convert it to JSON and post it to a PHP script that will save it as a file.
[13:21:35] <pachet> more of a php question
[13:21:37] <pachet> ^
[13:22:14] <playa> yes, I can create php script which stores that output, but how do I pass the string to php ?

[13:23:45] <Whirl3d> pachet, do you know jqueryUI CSS?
[13:24:01] <pachet> to an extent
[13:24:03] <pachet> what's up
[13:24:04] <PhanLord> is there an event if image is loaded from browser cache ?
[13:24:12] <PhanLord> i dont see onload being invoked in that case ?
[13:24:31] <Whirl3d> I need to make a simple close button and can't figure out what element to apply it to and which classes to add.
[13:24:59] <Whirl3d> I try the anchor button, but the classes fail on it because anchor's don't have background images (I am guessing that's why it fails)
[13:25:06] <Whirl3d> *anchor element
[13:26:31] <Whirl3d> and I use ui-button-icon-only and ui-icon-close, but can't figure out how to make it hoverable without coding it manually
[13:27:43] <danzik17> Whirl3d: when you say hoverable, do you mean the pointer?
[13:28:29] <realpap> dave_stein the problem was a double call to the nivo script and some option bad set, wich i still dunno wich was
[13:29:04] <danzik17> Whirl3d: that and why are you doing this manually anyway - use the aptly named "button" plugin on the ui site
[13:29:04] <Dave_Stein> realpap that makes sense :) calling animations twice wouldnt end well
[13:29:11] <realpap> :)
[13:29:15] <Whirl3d> danzik17, actually, the close icon changes to match the theme. It inverts colors on mouseenter for example.
[13:30:10] <Whirl3d> so, to keep it themeable, I have to add some combination of jquery UI css classes to an anchor element so that :hover style selector works
[13:32:45] <pachet> Whirl3d: have you tried overriding the ui-state-hover class for your selector
[13:35:12] <Whirl3d> pachet, thanks for the reply. The problem is that I want to adhere to the jqueryUI methodology as much as possible so that I can easily re-theme it if necessary.
[13:42:13] <Whirl3d> you'd think that the jQueryUI CSS would have a simple: a.ui-icon-hover class that would set the background image to the default state and then a.ui-icon-hover:hover class that would set the background image to the highlight state.
[13:42:38] <kevin> If I want to capture the submit event $("form").bind("submit", function(e){..... but I want to continue the form submission after some further action, how can I do this?
[13:43:13] <kevin> say for instance I want to show a dialog notifying the user of something, but after they click "OK" in the dialog I want to continue submitting the form...
[13:43:44] <slash_nick> I'm using ajax to render a partial within a page.  The partial i'm calling (redundantly) displays the application's header and footer.  To hide all that, should I use .ajax's dataFilter option or .filter() ?  Which is best?
[13:44:11] <pachet> Whirl3d: the issue is that icons inherit the ui-state-hover class for skinning purposes, not their own independent class
[13:44:27] <pachet> lends to easily mutable theming across jqui as a whole i guess
[13:47:04] <slash_nick> Are .ajax's dataFilter option or jquery's .filter function faster than using $(".class #id").css("display", "none");      ???
[13:50:55] <Whirl3d> pachet, I figured the ui-icon-close class gives the cooordinates of the close glyph, the ui-state-hover sets the source for the background sprite image and then a ui-state-hover:hover declaration would set the source for the althernate background sprite image.
[13:51:20] <Whirl3d> *alternate
[13:52:21] <ccmonsters> no clue slash_nick
[13:53:04] <pachet> Whirl3d: no, the only :hover rule in the ui css is for anchor text color
[13:53:22] <pachet> background changes on hover is done by adding and removing an independent class
[13:54:58] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick you should try jsperf

[13:57:57] <FNTom> Anybody know a good list with some fancy jQuery widgets / UI widgets? Multi-select boxes and such
[13:58:09] <FNTom> I saw a nice one in here not long ago for selecting tags from auto complete
[13:58:15] <FNTom> Forgot to bookmark it though
[13:59:11] <slash_nick> Dave_Stein: I'll check it out...thanks man.  I can't get dataFilter or .filter to do anything and I think .hide is too slow and ugly.
[13:59:38] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick what are you trying to do? .hide is very different than a filder
[13:59:40] <Dave_Stein> *filter
[14:01:02] <jbalint_> how can i specify an attribute selector for a value that doesnt contain either of two or more words?
[14:02:10] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_: you mean it doesnt contain words from a blacklist?
[14:02:18] <slash_nick> Dave_Stein: situation: I'm rendering a partial, but can't keep the application's header/footer images from re-rendering when I do... looks like 'ell.
[14:02:33] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: yes
[14:02:47] <pachet> jbalint_: override .filter()
[14:02:52] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: a partial? sometimes im not too good with terminology :)
[14:02:59] <Whirl3d> pachet, sounds like poor css design to me that you have to explicitly add a seperate class to a hoverable element to get a hover effect. I'm rethinking the use of jqueryUI now.
[14:03:14] <slash_nick> Page within a page using an asynchronous get with ajax
[14:03:25] <Dave_Stein> pachet: wouldnt he just do .not([a=word_one][b=word_two])
[14:03:25] <jbalint_> pachet: thanks. i will look into it
[14:03:34] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: ah gotcha
[14:03:49] <Dave_Stein> Whirl3d: that's not accurate, its good practice
[14:04:04] <Dave_Stein> Whirl3d: not all browsers listen to :hover on random elements, such as older IE versions
[14:04:08] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: those a/b selectors most both be satisfied, i need either of them to be satisfied
[14:04:29] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: like .not([a=word_one] Or [b=word_two])
[14:04:49] <Dave_Stein> pachet: can you do that with filter??
[14:05:14] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: why would your footer and header be -rerendering cause of an ajax call? is the ajax call pulling down the header and footer still?
[14:05:47] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: it seems i can just take on anything, .(whatever).filter(":not(this)").filter(":not(that)")
[14:05:51] <jbalint_> *tack
[14:06:28] <ajpiano> jbalint_: you can also use .not(".whatever")
[14:06:31] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ that crossed my mind but is pretty ick
[14:06:47] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ i hope you are using attributes for a reason and not classes haha
[14:06:48] <ccmonsters> ajpiano: what is your design pattern of choice, if you have one that is...?
[14:06:59] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: anytime i make suggestions like that, the user says they cant control their markup haha
[14:07:12] <Dave_Stein> jbalint_ is there a reason youre not using classes ?
[14:07:29] <jbalint_> Dave_Stein: yes
[14:07:45] <slash_nick> Dave_Stein: It's pretty unexpected... I can't wrap my head around it
[14:07:51] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: my random two cents is that I use Backbone.js' pattern altho not the actual framework along with observer
[14:08:17] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: yeah if your extra HTML is coming in, thats not something you should be solving in jQuery
[14:08:20] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: i was just saying that .not("selector") is preferable to .filter(":not(selector)")
[14:08:24] <ccmonsters> observer pattern, and you use a pattern than backbone.js uses?
[14:08:36] <Whirl3d> Dave_Stein, that sounds like you should add code to accommodate the non-hoverable legacy browsers rather than just always adding code to facilitate hover
[14:09:00] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: yeah i took the extend function of backbone to have classes work the way i want it to
[14:09:00] <slash_nick> Dave_Stein: you're right.  I would like to understand using .ajax's dataFilter option though.
[14:09:20] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: and then events are your best friend in general, for an app that's not refreshing
[14:09:43] <ccmonsters> I see. I have never used Backbone.js.
[14:09:48] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: so i have like 3 elements that are "views" and bind to "update" event so that if user changes the name of something, they all are listening and update the text
[14:10:00] <Dave_Stein> things like that, events are yummy
[14:10:10] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: i've never used it before to be honest
[14:10:15] <ccmonsters> ah, so you trigger a custom event, and then have event handlers that determine what view needs to occur.
[14:10:32] <ccmonsters> did i get that right?
[14:10:47] <slash_nick> Dave_Stein: bet there's an ajax channel on here =) thanks man...
[14:10:52] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: that's a separate thing
[14:10:57] <jbalint_> ajpiano: thanks
[14:11:04] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: that data filter thing seems like poor practice for people that can't change what the server is sending
[14:11:19] <speyburn> Hi guys, another night, another problem :/ could someone tell me why my dialog wont open in this situation when i press the "delete" "button" :) http://jsfiddle.net/XS4Mq/
[14:11:24] <Dave_Stein> slash_nick: it sounds as bad as async
[14:11:47] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: i use ba-bbq for like URL routing and that hits a controller that determines views. but my views are aware of events that happen
[14:12:03] <jbalint_> ajpiano: seems this is doable x:not(this):not(that)
[14:12:11] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: just checkout backbone.js it's pretty nifty but i dont use it since they duplicate logic thats in jquery, hence me just taking what i wanted
[14:12:22] <ccmonsters> Ok. I have an app that uses History.js to handle the various change/update events
[14:12:26] <pachet> jbalint_: , Dave_Stein: eh, ickier than i thought it would be : http://jsfiddle.net/xxDaE/
[14:12:45] <ccmonsters> then i trigger various custom events from there, and then handle them accordingly.
[14:12:52] <pachet> might as well just write a function for it ; /
[14:12:54] <ajpiano> jbalint_: .not(".this, .that") should work
[14:13:33] <ccmonsters> I dont do much revealing module pattern, but I think i might start trying it out.
[14:13:43] <ccmonsters> it looks clean. some nice accessibility.
[14:14:01] <Dave_Stein> that's the one where you return an object of "public" methods right?
[14:14:27] <ccmonsters> yea, and those public methods can be renamed for 'public' access, as opposed to what you might name the private function within the scope of the actual function
[14:14:31] <Dave_Stein> i make all my methods public as of late and just use _ to mark them as "private" since anyone can get into anything "private" using stop points and firebug anyway
[14:14:56] <ccmonsters> so object.getmyShit() can publicly be accessed as object.get() , which references the private function .getmyshit()
[14:14:58] <ccmonsters> lol
[14:14:59] <Dave_Stein> plus if you make too many things private it's nearly impossible tp properly unit test them
[14:15:15] <Dave_Stein> if youre always naming functions properly they should say what they do and it wouldnt matter
[14:15:16] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:15:24] <ccmonsters> yes and no.
[14:15:32] <ccmonsters> i can understand it either way
[14:16:06] <Dave_Stein> well i cant argue too hard anyway, revealing module is super popular from what i can tell
[14:16:27] <ajpiano> revealing module ftw
[14:16:31] <ccmonsters> Yea, it appears so. Im usually just doing a singleton, module pattern.
[14:16:35] <Dave_Stein> to be honest, i just started that backbone thing and got uplled off of it. buttt
[14:16:40] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: that's what i was doing
[14:16:47] <Dave_Stein> but i prefer backbones method over revealing module
[14:16:53] <Dave_Stein> cause then my code looks like actual classes
[14:16:57] <ccmonsters> not sure what backbones method is.
[14:16:58] <ajpiano> i use revealing module with backbone
[14:17:10] <ajpiano> so that i have a module full of views and models etc etc
[14:17:13] <ccmonsters> you come from JAVA or OOP languages Dave_Stein ?
[14:17:15] <ajpiano> and then most of it is private to itself
[14:17:27] <ccmonsters> nice. I need to get down on the RMP then :)
[14:17:27] <Dave_Stein> i taught myself so i come from the web ha didnt do OOP until 3 years ago
[14:17:29] <ajpiano> and then there's an explicit interface if other modules theoretically need to internact w/ it
[14:17:49] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: its interesting you put the views and models into the same module
[14:18:06] <ccmonsters> Ok. I come from Java, groovy etc.
[14:18:08] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: all my views, controllers, and models are in separate files. the controller knows which ones to autoload
[14:18:12] <ajpiano> yeah i think the whole like, every view/model as a separate file in a separate dir is kind of... illogical
[14:18:17] <ccmonsters> I am all for the class looking approach
[14:18:33] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i dont think so cause several views have the need of the same model to populate data
[14:18:34] <ajpiano> i prefer to encapsulate stuff by functionality
[14:19:00] <ccmonsters> i've never tried a JS MVC approach
[14:19:02] <ajpiano> but of course, that doesn't mean any of those things have to be in sep files
[14:19:43] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: well lets say theres two views for the same data in an app. the user might not ever hit second view
[14:20:05] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: so my controller knows to call model for each view, but i only ever load the source for a view when its asked
[14:20:37] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: also smaller files are easier to manage
[14:21:06] <Dave_Stein> but in the end i think these differences are highly subjective cause im guessing both of our apps arent too hard to navigate and update
[14:21:19] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: re:unit-testing  you should only really need to test your public interface, no?  if the public interface works as expected, then the private methods should be as well
[14:21:20] <Dave_Stein> we're strict on our folder struvture so more files doesnt impact us
[14:21:31] <MaxMeents> imagine a png image that is mostly transparent except for a person or object in the middle, you need to make a rollover action for the person or object and many images are going to be close to each other so the transparent portion will overlap other images. How do you set up actions for 30+ images, with 20 to 30 more each month
[14:21:39] <ajpiano> yeah it depends so much on the app you're building and what it's lifespan is, etc.
[14:21:52] <ajpiano> anyhow, i have to get ready for this wedding
[14:21:56] <speyburn> Hi guys, could someone help me and tell why my dialog wont open in this situation when i press the "delete" "button" :) http://jsfiddle.net/XS4Mq/
[14:22:01] <ajpiano> it's finally on, no hurricane this time Dave_Stein :)
[14:22:02] <ccmonsters> good luck with the wedding Adam
[14:22:05] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: but where do you draw the line on public and private methods in JS?
[14:22:11] <Dave_Stein> haha sweet
[14:22:12] <Dave_Stein> have fun
[14:22:17] <ccmonsters> btw, isnt jquery-con this weekend?
[14:22:21] <ajpiano> it is
[14:22:23] <Dave_Stein> yup cc
[14:22:25] <ajpiano> i'm leaving for it at 2:40 AM :/
[14:22:29] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i found myself making too many things private in general so maybe im just too extreme
[14:22:32] <ccmonsters> eww. Boston, right?
[14:22:34] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:22:56] <ccmonsters> And, on a side note... Why boston? Can we go more Central than that next time pweese :O
[14:23:03] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: i'm struggling with the same thing - i don't use backbone, but implemented my own flavor of MVC as i felt it gave me slightly more control
[14:23:04] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: yeah central like NYC :)
[14:23:24] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i dont know if you caught that i only took out the extend method of backbone, the rest of mine is custom to have more control too :)
[14:23:46] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i liked their overall pattern, but not that everything was "automatic" meaning more calls for no reason
[14:23:49] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: but, things like say the logic for caching, ajax calls, etc...  all of that is private - i only expose things like "add, remove"
[14:24:22] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: well that app i only spent like 2 weeks on before getting pulled off. ill have to remember this conversation when i go back to it next month
[14:24:42] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: and hooks for various events - you can either subscribe to my event with .bind, or i provide a shortcutmethod called like "onSubscribe" which essentially just takes a handler and points it at the event
[14:25:05] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: i'd be really interested when you do
[14:25:35] <shaft0> If I want to find a string that starts with a word, and ends with a specific word, but I need to know the words in between, how would I do that?  .indexof?
[14:25:39] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: the hardest thing i'm struggling with is actually cascading controller actions and partial views, but the app is fairly complex
[14:25:45] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i was also using bind a lot, not the jquery one, but random event bind not to DOM
[14:26:09] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: the one change i made to backbone's extend function was to make it cascade through all parent constructors
[14:26:13] <ccmonsters> indexof is part of it shaft0
[14:26:28] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: right now i'm just triggering an event on $({}) to to pubsub - ill replace that with $.Channels when we can move to 1.7
[14:26:29] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i didnt want to have to explicitly call .setName( name ) in each child of like "Product" cause obviously they all need setname
[14:26:32] <shaft0> how do I set the, err, I forget the name of the term, delimiter?
[14:26:52] <shaft0> like "extract from here to here, stop at the word 'derp'"
[14:26:57] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i also need to jump onto $.deferred, i had written my own 15 line file pretty much
[14:27:08] <ccmonsters> google for finding string in sentence
[14:27:18] <Dave_Stein> shaft0 you can do 'asdfdasfs'.indexOf('dfd') and then substr on it
[14:27:26] <ccmonsters> subtrings and index of, etc are what you're going to be doing
[14:27:39] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: its SO nice.  being able to provide the exact same api/interface whether the object needs to be retrieved from AJAX or a local cache is just WIN
[14:27:43] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: well backbone had its own event thing so i stole that along with extend, i knew i took 2 things but couldnt remember
[14:27:50] <shaft0> perfect, thanks!  No problem with googling it if I know the right keywords, yea? ;)
[14:27:57] <ccmonsters> yeap
[14:27:58] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: my brain is stalling, whats pubsub again
[14:28:18] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i know ive read it before haha
[14:28:20] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: publish/subscribe - think events with no bubbling kind of
[14:28:28] <Dave_Stein> ohhh duh
[14:28:29] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:28:43] <Dave_Stein> lol i get what you mean now
[14:28:47] <Dave_Stein> with the $({})
[14:29:00] <ccmonsters> ooh, backbone uses hashtags for routers? ....ugh
[14:29:10] <ccmonsters> pubsubhub yay!
[14:29:19] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: that's what i do with ba-bbq :)
[14:29:28] <ccmonsters> you should use History.js
[14:29:36] <ccmonsters> its better than bbq, as much as I love it
[14:29:38] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: yea, that was a trick i read on one of the devs blogs i think - but $.Channels will beat the hell out of it when its released
[14:29:44] <ccmonsters> ben alman is a stud js guy too.
[14:29:54] <Dave_Stein> what is it exactly?
[14:30:05] <Dave_Stein> is like "DOM" and "anything" a channel?
[14:30:14] <ccmonsters> Cross Browser, Backwards Compatable History Framework
[14:30:47] <ccmonsters> so it will set and get Hashtag style urls, or newer generation History API's for the modern browsers
[14:31:07] <danzik17> i dont have any of their slides, but essentially it's a very efficient event emitter i think, moreso than events - might better performance
[14:31:18] <realpap> fuuuuuuucking nivo slider
[14:31:20] <danzik17> and you don't need to implement a lot of the logic - jquery does it for you
[14:31:20] <realpap> dave
[14:31:26] <realpap> its still showing bad
[14:31:30] <ccmonsters> So I have a AJAX app that will function in firefox 3.6, ie 7, ie8, Chrome old and new, Safari etc, with full use of back/forward buttons, with one small framework
[14:31:33] <realpap> the slider alone with NO options
[14:31:35] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: sorry i was asking about $.channels :)
[14:31:36] <realpap> shows bad :(
[14:31:37] <danzik17> its just like channel.publish( data ); DONE.
[14:31:53] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: that does sound exciting
[14:31:59] <ccmonsters> got ya
[14:32:01] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: although i am less excited since i have my own version of that for now :)
[14:32:16] <Dave_Stein> ccmonsters: i stick to ba-bbq cause a) i heard of it first b) ben alman does it
[14:32:17] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:32:26] <Dave_Stein> c) i already have it in too many places
[14:32:31] <ccmonsters> btw, you guys see that Classes are coming to the new ECMA standards :O
[14:32:37] <ccmonsters> Fair enough Dave.
[14:33:37] <kevin> anybody know how to pause the submission of a form with jQuery, but continue after some additional input is given?
[14:33:51] <realpap> i dont get it
[14:33:56] <realpap> it fails one in a million times
[14:33:56] <gearaholic> Im working on a page that will ultimately be embedded into a Sharepoint site.  The sharepoint site has jquery 1.4.4,  If i load jquery 1.6.4 will it override the older version?
[14:33:59] <realpap> http://realpap.byethost14.com/slier.html
[14:34:06] <Dave_Stein> realpap: sorry i cant help with thatone, i know my coworkers chose cycle as the plugin
[14:34:26] <Dave_Stein> gearaholic: yes if the script tag is sitting there
[14:34:39] <ccmonsters> yes, it should override
[14:34:40] <Dave_Stein> gearaholic: and probably break their site cause 1.4 and 1.6 are pretty diff - i just did that upgrade last month
[14:34:49] <realpap> ok ill try cycle
[14:34:52] <realpap> tbx
[14:34:52] <ccmonsters> Yes, there are some BIG changes in 1.6x
[14:35:00] <Dave_Stein> attr and prop
[14:35:02] <Dave_Stein> yum
[14:35:25] <gearaholic> Dave_Stein: yeah,  but this is only going to be one page,  not the entire site,  so im not worried about 1.4 to 1.6 changes
[14:35:34] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: How painful was it?  We're on 1.5.x at the moment, but I'm definitely gonna push for 1.7 when it comes out
[14:35:43] <ccmonsters> well, it has some pretty fundamental changes with properties and attributes
[14:36:00] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i did a regex search for like .attr( "checked" and aother properties and the nreplaced em. went with .is(":checked") instead
[14:36:21] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: luckily my UI was already updated cause i remember one UI update was big with how they changed around options and whatnot
[14:36:45] <ccmonsters> yea, that was UI 1.5x ...i think...
[14:36:59] <ccmonsters> maybe 1.7, i cant rememebr.. ...ugh
[14:37:45] <Dave_Stein> i think it was 1.7
[14:37:50] <ccmonsters> sounds right.
[14:38:04] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: you just have to make sure you look at docs for going from 1.4 to 1.5 and then 1.5 to 1.6. its not too bad of a list
[14:38:20] <kevin> is there something like event.continueDefault(); or something?
[14:38:21] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: but i gotta admit my QA guy did find a lot of bugs in my site i had to catch that way before getting into production
[14:38:23] <kevin> for event handling?
[14:38:29] <Dave_Stein> kevin: once it's stopped, it's stopped
[14:38:33] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: i'm pretty familiar with them, just wondering how bad the *actual* transition was =P
[14:39:31] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: i dont think anything bad got into production
[14:39:40] <kevin> Dave_Stein: Any idea how to submit a form once it's submitted then? Say I want a user to submit a form, then I bind the submit event, do event.preventDefault to stop the form submission, make an ajax call to verify something, and if it returns a certain value then the form continues to submit
[14:39:54] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: although i cheated cause i had another site on 1.6 so i knew the changes i had to make ie for selectmenu
[14:40:34] <Dave_Stein> kevin: i do that all the time. my form builder actually makes sure all my forms get onsubmit="return false;"
[14:40:47] <Dave_Stein> kevin: but my JS binds to whatever $("#form").submit
[14:41:06] <Dave_Stein> kevin: my callback verifies the stuff, and then uses JS to redirect or do whatever else
[14:41:08] <ccmonsters> just bind to the submit event.
[14:41:13] <kevin> Dave_Stein: I tried event.preventDefault() early on, then in the case that the ajax call returns a value that should allow the form to continue, then I $("form").unbind("submit").trigger("submit"); but that doesnt' work
[14:41:19] <ccmonsters> do some validation as part of your logic on whether to complete the submit
[14:41:36] <Dave_Stein> kevin: right when you wanna go just do: window.location.href = $('#form').attr( 'action' );
[14:41:38] <ccmonsters> or use the validation plugin, and it's partially wrapped all up for you
[14:42:00] <Dave_Stein> kevin: since the only thing youre losing by stopping the submit is the actual redirection which you can handle with that one line
[14:42:01] <ccmonsters> but that might be overkill, depending on how much you really need to validate
[14:42:22] <kevin> but will the form values be POSTed if I just redirect like that?
[14:42:30] <kevin> Dave_Stein: but will the form values be POSTed if I just redirect like that?
[14:42:31] <ccmonsters> are you using a server side piece to return a true/false on validation?
[14:42:37] <kevin> ccmonsters: yep
[14:42:45] <Dave_Stein> kevin: oh ha what i do is $.ajax the post over on succesful validation
[14:42:51] <kevin> ccmonsters: and it's somewhat mission critical, so it needs to work with JS turned off, etc, etc
[14:43:03] <ccmonsters> then attach to the Submit, ajax success: on your validation and submit
[14:43:12] <Dave_Stein> kevin: ah i se my solution doesnt work - we dont care about people with JS turned off
[14:43:13] <ccmonsters> AHHHH!
[14:43:33] <ccmonsters> Well, in that case...
[14:43:39] <ccmonsters> good luck. may the force be with you :)
[14:43:41] <Dave_Stein> kevin: i mean really if someone has JS turned off they did it themselves and know how to turn it back on
[14:43:57] <kevin> i'm dealing with potentially up to a million users
[14:44:02] <ccmonsters> Ok.
[14:44:07] <Dave_Stein> kevin: i deal with that many too :)
[14:44:16] <kevin> so even if .05% have it turned off, that could still make a headache for customer service
[14:44:19] <Dave_Stein> kevin: but ive read a few articles and agree, that devs shouldnt be concerned about people like that
[14:44:31] <ccmonsters> Yea. I'm on a top 60 website. Plenty of users. JS is a must these days
[14:44:39] <kevin> ccmonsters: I agree, totally
[14:44:48] <Dave_Stein> kevin: untrue, we're in top 1k and never get any complaints aobut JS
[14:45:01] <Dave_Stein> kevin: its on by default, any user expriencing issue would realize its cause JS is turned off - by them
[14:45:14] <ccmonsters> It's a headache, but one that can be avoided. "if no js, direct them to a page"
[14:45:22] <kevin> Dave_Stein: well, I don't have the power to decide, ultimately. We're being contracted to do this, and the client is requiring that we support users w/o JS
[14:45:23] <ccmonsters> and tell them to get some FUCKING JS
[14:45:29] <Whirl3d> off topic, slightly, could someone help with a CSS question regarding scrollbars? I tried #css and someone pissed in their cheerios (since birth, I'd bet)
[14:45:30] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:45:30] <kevin> ccmonsters: lolz, i wish
[14:45:34] <Dave_Stein> kevin: that client sucks
[14:45:37] <Dave_Stein> ha
[14:45:49] <jebaird> Whirl3d what's up?
[14:45:51] <ccmonsters> overflow...something
[14:45:59] <Dave_Stein> so just bind to submit using JS, preventDefault, do validation, then do location.href= to the action
[14:46:05] <Dave_Stein> if user has JS turned off
[14:46:07] <Dave_Stein> you dont have client side validation
[14:46:09] <depressed> Hello I'm getting an uncaught exception error in jquery.js - is there something wrong with this: {a[2]||k.error(a[0]),a[2]=a[2].replace(/^\+|\s*/g,"");var b=/(-?)(\d*)(?:n([+\-]?\d*))?/.exec(a[2]==="even"&&"2n"||a[2]==="odd"&&"2n+1"||!/\D/.test(a[2])&&"0n+"+a[2]||a[2]);a[2]=b[1]+(b[2]||1)-0,a[3]=b[3]-0}
[14:46:09] <Dave_Stein> and it will just go
[14:46:22] <ccmonsters> Yeap
[14:46:31] <Dave_Stein> you should program with the non-minified version and then get a real line number
[14:46:32] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:46:34] <ccmonsters> in which case, your action/method better go somewhere that helps them out :O
[14:46:35] <Whirl3d> I can't figure out what combination of position and overflow is needed to get a div take up the entire space of it's parent and scroll if necessary.
[14:46:55] <jebaird> Whirl3d just a sec
[14:47:01] <ccmonsters> fill in those damn methods/actions..
[14:47:02] <depressed> The error I see is Uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [href$=http://www.domain.com/nobody/]
[14:47:08] <Dave_Stein> kevin: make sense? im about to hop off
[14:47:17] <ccmonsters> lol, i can honestly say ive forgotten to do it so many times because I ajax everything these days and they mena nothing to me lol
[14:47:17] <kevin> Dave_Stein: So say I am then bringing them to step 2
[14:47:20] <Whirl3d> jebaird, thanks for your help.
[14:47:40] <kevin> Dave_Stein: Currently, I check the POST to see if it has values carried from Step 1
[14:48:04] <kevin> Dave_Stein: I guess I could set a session variable or something
[14:48:05] <ccmonsters> sounds like a plan
[14:48:06] <Dave_Stein> kevin: there is a $_SERVER var to know if youre ajax or not
[14:48:29] <ccmonsters> Write that POS like it's all OLD school, then create a JS solution on top of it so you are covered either way
[14:48:45] <kevin> ccmonsters: that's what I did!
[14:48:47] <jebaird> Whirl3d no problem http://jsfiddle.net/jebaird/U2Zzp/11/
[14:48:48] <Dave_Stein> oh oh i got an idea
[14:48:50] <ccmonsters> i'd hate your client , btw
[14:48:51] <ccmonsters> :)
[14:49:12] <jebaird> Whirl3d: just add a bunch of content to the .middle should tirgger overflow
[14:49:16] <ccmonsters> and probably want to feed them to my Server rack
[14:49:21] <Dave_Stein> var checked = false; $('#form').submit( function( if ( checked ) { return true; } else { e.stop() // do validation checked = true // submit again };
[14:49:24] <kevin> Dave_Stein: Just to check though, do you have any idea why it wouldn't work to event.preventDefault, do my ajax call, and if everything is ok then do $("form").unbind("submit").trigger("submit");? (hint: it doesn't work)
[14:49:40] <Dave_Stein> kevin: ha thats what i was just suggesting
[14:49:49] <ccmonsters> yea
[14:49:50] <Dave_Stein> kevin: but a diff way
[14:49:55] <Dave_Stein> kevin: that should work
[14:50:04] <ccmonsters> do it all in the submit, like he suggested
[14:50:14] <Dave_Stein> okay really gotta go
[14:50:17] <Dave_Stein> gettin ready for holiday dinner
[14:50:18] <ccmonsters> adios.
[14:50:19] <Dave_Stein> oh to be jewish haha
[14:50:20] <Dave_Stein> ttyl
[14:50:20] <ccmonsters> nice.
[14:50:25] <kevin> adios thanks man <3
[14:50:26] <ccmonsters> Rosh SHANANANANAAN
[14:50:36] <ccmonsters> see ya
[14:50:59] <kevin> ccmonsters: the problem is that the validation can't happen client side
[14:51:21] <kevin> i mean, I can't just check if a thing is checked, I need to validate the data on the backend
[14:51:28] <ccmonsters> ok, then hit the server side script you are validating with in the other PHP script or w/e
[14:52:12] <ccmonsters> the checked = false doesn't matter if their JS is turned off. At that point the .submit event handler wont happen, and the page should POST as normal
[14:53:55] <nascro> Is it possible to add an element to a page containing a string submitted through a form on the same page?
[14:54:04] <ccmonsters> yes
[14:54:28] <kevin> ccmonsters: does this not look reasonable?
[14:54:39] <ccmonsters> cabput the submit event from that form, then $('#myDivIWantToAppendTo').append('stringFromMySubmitEvent');
[14:54:57] <ccmonsters> what is that kevin ?
[14:55:03] <kevin> sorry one sec, posting online
[14:55:06] <ccmonsters> cabput = capture
[14:56:09] <strider6> when i use a variable inside eq() filter it doesnt work...any reason ?
[14:56:10] <kevin> http://snipt.org/xnpmo
[14:56:12] <kevin> ccmonsters: http://snipt.org/xnpmo
[14:56:32] <nascro> How would I take the string from the form and append it to the current page?
[14:56:33] <ccmonsters> strider6: a variable like what ?
[14:56:41] <ccmonsters> where on the current page nascro ?
[14:56:49] <ccmonsters> ? append @ nascro
[14:56:50] <bot-t> nascro, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:56:50] <strider6> a global variable...number
[14:57:09] <ccmonsters> ? demo @ strider6
[14:57:09] <bot-t> strider6, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:57:38] <strider6> ok
[14:57:47] <Whirl3d> wow. jsfiddle doesn't automatically load a jquery UI theme when including jqueryUI?
[14:58:07] <jebaird> nope pretty dumb
[14:58:35] <nascro> @ccmonsters: like this: http://pastie.org/2619325
[14:58:56] <ccmonsters> kevin: what is yoru issue?
[14:59:07] <ccmonsters> in that code you are checking to see if it validates, right?
[14:59:08] <nascro> I'm pretty sure I've got the append down, just not sure how to get the data from the form
[14:59:24] <kevin> ccmonsters: the issue is that line #26 doesn't do what I want it to do
[14:59:33] <kevin> ccmonsters: I want it to submit the form
[14:59:54] <ccmonsters> why you ubinding?
[14:59:58] <ccmonsters> unbinding*
[15:00:26] <kevin> ccmonsters: i'm unbinding because if I don't then it automatically catches the submit event
[15:00:36] <ccmonsters> um.
[15:00:44] <ccmonsters> sounds like you need to better break out your stuff.
[15:01:04] <kevin> ccmonsters: what do you mean?
[15:01:07] <ccmonsters> first pass, validate. if (true){ // now second ajax/post with form data}
[15:01:13] <Whirl3d> jebaird, here is the context that I am having problems with: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/wp46s/6/
[15:01:32] <ccmonsters> right now, with false your popping up a modal that says "you messed up"
[15:02:02] <jebaird> Whirl3d: okay looking
[15:02:14] <ccmonsters> nascro: that wont work at all. that does nothing really
[15:02:20] <kevin> ccmonsters: the thing is, either way the form submits, what you don't see (because it's not there yet) is that when you click "ok" in the dialog, the form submits
[15:02:26] <jebaird> Whirl3d so  what do you want to scroll?
[15:03:06] <nascro> @ccmonsters: are you referring to the code I posted? That's semi-pseudocode for the intended output from the form.
[15:03:22] <Whirl3d> the content inside of each "profile" so that the header stays put (with the image and the title text)  basically, the .profile .content div
[15:03:47] <ccmonsters> what I saw wasn't very psuedo.....
[15:03:58] <strider6> when i replace the 'counter' variable with 0 the statement returns true other wise it returns false...any reason ? http://jsfiddle.net/c549D/
[15:05:24] <jebaird> Whirl3d: your going to have to wrap your profile content with an aboslue positioned div and have the overflow on that div auto
[15:06:24] <Whirl3d> jebaird, does that mean that I have to resize the .content div every time the window resizes?
[15:06:54] <ccmonsters> nascro: you need to do something more...like http://pastie.org/2619358
[15:07:01] <ccmonsters> that in no way works exactly, but that's the flow
[15:07:13] <jebaird> Whirl3d: depend on your layout, if the content is  the same size then no
[15:07:40] <nascro> @ccmonsters: thank you. I'm testing it out.
[15:07:47] <ccmonsters> refresh and look at that.
[15:07:53] <ccmonsters> i tweaked one thing for you nascro
[15:08:19] <nascro> Added the p element?
[15:08:21] <nascro> Good catch

[15:15:38] <jvm_> hi. using jquery tools tooltips, i would like to be able to dynamically switch all tooltips on and off. is there a trick?
[15:16:39] <MISI> strider6: you used counter as a string, not as a variable
[15:16:50] <MISI> alert($("li:eq(" + counter + ")").hasClass('toTop'));
[15:17:10] <matiu> jvm, maybe some global css selector .. $('.someClass').tooltips = off ?
[15:17:36] <Cameron> anyone???
[15:17:56] <matiu> What was your question Cameron ?
[15:18:10] <Cameron> <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/RedFox/index.html

[15:18:30] <fluxfox> Cameron: please stop highlighting me :P
[15:18:47] <strider6> @MISI so is it not possible to use just the variable in any filters
[15:18:49] <Cameron> hmm lol
[15:19:22] <MISI> strider6: http://jsfiddle.net/c549D/1/
[15:20:17] <matiu> Cameron, ah, I don't know :P sorry :)
[15:20:24] <matiu> too much work for busy me :)
[15:20:28] <Cameron> :( ok, anyone else?
[15:20:40] <matiu> I can confirm that it is happening for me though
[15:20:53] <Cameron> ok
[15:21:00] <Cameron> its weird
[15:21:40] <strider6> @ MISI Thank you.....I guess thats how eq() behaves....
[15:22:10] <MISI> by + you can "connect" strong with variables like that

[15:42:21] <playa> umm hey guys, im sorry I've alredy asked this like an hour ago and got answer but cant find my way to finish this script. please, can you explain me in details, or give me a link to some good tutorial on how to pass very long string to php using ajax post ?
[15:42:53] <cheriot> jquery-tmpl seems to have been in beta forever
[15:43:57] <snover> that’s because MS apparently doesn’t know how to keep developers tasked on things until they are done

[15:45:40] <cheriot> snover, any recommendation on an alternative client side templating lib?
[15:45:46] <Brodingo> and never go to .it again
[15:46:57] <snover> cheriot: underscore.
[15:47:04] <snover> cheriot: orrrrrrrrr templated dijit widgets
[15:47:11] <snover> but I’M SURE you don’t want to do that
[15:47:18] <dogarrhea2> what's with the .it domain brodingo?
[15:47:29] <dogarrhea2> it showed up as second link in google for : jquery slider
[15:47:54] <cheriot> heh, I'll check out underscore. Thanks

[17:08:08] <BinaryKitten> RomanH you don't
[17:08:16] <BinaryKitten> an object {} must have a key
[17:08:31] <BinaryKitten> you can do it via an array though

[17:40:56] <danzik17> AfroTurf: One per event binding.  Nothing is stopping you from writing a handler that passes off the arguments to N other handlers though
[17:43:08] <AfroTurf> danzik17: ok thanks
[17:57:21] <jacof> this seems to be a little tricky. How do you replace an element (<div class="class"><p>content</p></div>) with its .html() (leave just <p>content</p>). in other words, remove the wrapper.
[17:57:33] <jacof> ?
[18:16:21] <pl0sh> hey guys, this is a dummy question, how can I make a var globally available?
[18:16:58] <FNTom> Define it in the global scope, not inside any functions.
[18:17:00] <pl0sh> I mean, I need to assign it a value inside a $(document).ready() block, but I need it to be accesible from outside that block, is that possible?
[18:17:22] <FNTom> But you may want to look at jQuery's data store
[18:17:24] <pl0sh> I am trying it, but it doesn't work..
[18:17:36] <FNTom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[18:18:00] <pl0sh> ok, let me see, thanks
[18:18:12] <jacof> jQuery("#theme-my-login1").unwrap();jQuery("#theme-my-login1").prevUntil("h2").addClass("theme-my-plugin"); <- What's wrong with this
[18:18:28] <jacof> just the second part, actually.
[18:21:57] <jacof> makes no sense.
[18:29:59] <pl0sh> FNTom: jquery data didn't work
[18:31:05] <FNTom> I think you're doing something wrong then :P
[18:31:43] <pl0sh> maybe
[18:32:52] <pl0sh> http://jsfiddle.net/ARKhr/
[18:38:40] <FNTom> Helps if you don't have MooTools as the Javascript library ;)
[18:38:53] <FNTom> And if you use the correct number of paramaters
[18:40:02] <pl0sh> well, but on my end I have jquery and it doesn't work
[18:40:07] <pl0sh> and it's the same code
[18:42:11] <pl0sh> I get undefined on my alert
[18:44:14] <teear> http://design.fldx.org
[18:44:45] <kerozene> pl0sh: I get 12 when I switch jsfiddle to jquery
[18:44:47] <FNTom> pl0sh: http://jsfiddle.net/xYBta/
[18:45:03] <FNTom> You want to bind it to the document body so it's available globally
[18:45:06] <pl0sh> yes, me too
[18:45:35] <FNTom> pl0sh: Use my example I posted, that'll get you started.
[18:45:44] <FNTom> Next time read the documentation a little closer :P
[18:45:46] <pl0sh> ok, let me see..
[18:46:51] <kerozene> FNTom: what's wrong with setting it on the div?
[18:47:01] <pl0sh> a is null
[18:47:01] <pl0sh> (function(a,b){function cv(a){return f...ndexOf(".")>=0&&(i=h.split("."),h=i.
[18:47:11] <pl0sh> I get that error on my jquery library 1.6.2
[18:47:19] <pl0sh> however on jsfiddle it works perfect
[18:49:00] <FNTom> kerozene: Sure, he can but from my understanding he wanted it global
[18:49:16] <FNTom> And if you set it on a div but want to use it globally, you'd have to use the selector every time to find the div first
[18:49:27] <kerozene> fair enough
[18:49:33] <FNTom> Usually storing it in the div is the way to go for sure :)
[18:55:33] <pl0sh> how can I cast that value as integer?
[18:56:13] <pl0sh> nm
[19:16:14] <slavka`> hey guys... im trying to create a JSON call that loads some data from server and then updates a certain div... the only thing i cant seem to work out how to do is pass the context to the response handling function...
[19:35:13] <Nuck> Making my first jQuery plugin (a tag input with a more modular autocomplete)
[19:35:29] <Nuck> Haven't the foggiest idea what I'm doing, but damnit, I'll try!
[19:39:16] <Ricoshady> im using uploadify, and its having some issues with I use the base html tag (that is different than the current URL in the browser)  any one had issues like this?
[19:39:40] <Ricoshady> it creates the object, but no calls from js after its created work correctly.
[20:01:47] <timack> quit
[20:13:20] <richardr> Say I had an array, and in this array I wanted to track a whole bunch of elements/Windows with the SAME class name. What approach should I take? Thanks
[20:15:41] <fructose> I'm sending an ajax request with a data: { list: list, id: id } where list is an array and id is a value. However, when list is empty (= []), I do receive any list with the request, only the id. First, is that expected behavior. Second, is there a way to force it to send empty arrays?
[20:16:38] <richardr> The reason I need to track them individually is because if they click 'X' on the box, I want to remove that particular element, and remove it from that array
[20:18:36] <pachet> er, sounds like a jq object populated via class selector would do that pretty efficiently ;O
[20:26:08] <pachet> fructose: yeah, its expected
[20:26:15] <pachet> i dont think there's a way to serialize an empty array
[20:26:24] <pachet> how would you tell it from an empty string/obj?
[20:27:49] <fructose> Well, I'm transmitting as JSON
[20:27:57] <fructose> So I would think the empty array would just be []
[20:28:47] <fructose> e.g. {"id":1,"list":[]}
[20:29:56] <danzik17> fructose: You're sending the data AS json?
[20:30:24] <fructose> danzik17: dataType: 'json'
[20:31:04] <danzik17> fructose: That's the dataType you're expecting to receive back, not what you're sending
[20:31:34] <richardr> pachet: each element will have unique characteristics managed in JS, that's why I need to be able to track them individually
[20:32:01] <danzik17> fructose: If you want to send json, just do data: JSON.stringify{ id: 1, list: [] }
[20:32:23] <fructose> danzik17: Ah. So is there not a way to represent empty arrays in post data? That would surprise me
[20:33:37] <danzik17> fructose: What would it post?  If you have an array foo and you're POSTing it, it usually sends as &foo=1&foo=2&foo=3....
[20:33:48] <danzik17> fructose: Now if you want to explicitly send a JSON string, you can do that
[20:35:21] <fructose> danzik17: Maybe it's a PHP thing, but values sent with [] are collected as a single array
[20:35:34] <fructose> danzik17: However, I thought that was an HTML feature
[20:36:05] <danzik17> fructose: Maybe - I'm not going to pretend to have PHP experience - purely C#/F#/.NET fanboy
[20:36:44] <fructose> danzik17: Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
[20:37:46] <fructose> Anyway, I just checked list.length and set it to 0 if empty
[20:37:52] <fructose> I feel hacky, but it works
[21:15:36] <JoeUser> Hi all, I'm currently using Jquery to have a larger image appear next to the lower right corner of an image when a user hovers over it. To accomplish this, each image in placed in lick tags with a class referenced by my code which can be found here: http://pastebin.com/9MaS03aU However, I'm only able to get the coordinates of the mouse and keep failing to get the lower right X/Y position of the link (i.e.e $(this) ) that's being
[21:15:37] <JoeUser> Could some1 please offer any advice?
[21:15:57] <JoeUser> link* tags - not lick tags. Sorry!
[21:50:53] <richardr> Has anyone used the technique `list zipper` for data structures in JS?
[23:04:23] <riyonuk> ive got an effect that works on mouseover, how would I make it so that it works when the page loads?
[23:05:03] <riyonuk> ".mouseover(function()" works, but ".ready()" doesn't. :/
[23:05:40] <snover> eh?
[23:14:07] <whackyMan> hi, i have an ajax function. the server responds with a string "OK". In the ajax response function i have. function (response){ if (response == 'OK') {do something;}); problem is i cannot "do something" even though it returns OK as alert(response) gives "OK"
[23:20:41] <whackyMan> any ideas why i cannot catch the reponse in the if statement?
[23:23:21] <Nuck> Okay, I'm trying to write a jQuery addon, and I need to store options between $.fn.addTag and $.fn.tagInput
[23:23:31] <angvp> hi ppl, quick question i have a field in a form with an id called "person.name" (the dot is not mine is auto-generated) for example, and i'm having an issue when I do $('#person.name').val() the value that I got is undefined, any idea?
[23:23:59] <Nuck> IS that even valid?
[23:24:03] <Nuck> >_>
[23:24:13] <Nuck> .thing is a class selector
[23:24:29] <Nuck> IDK if CSS has a way of escaping
[23:24:31] <angvp> Nuck: I know, tell that to the framework that i'm using..
[23:25:32] <Nuck> Haha what framework?
[23:25:48] <angvp> Nuck: catalyst + form::fu
[23:30:34] <whackyMan> hi, i have an ajax function. the server responds with a string "OK". In the ajax response function i have. function (response){ if (response == 'OK') {do something;}); problem is i cannot "do something" even though it returns OK as alert(response) gives "OK"
[23:32:27] <albertosh> can you show some code?
[23:32:31] <albertosh> maybe over jsfiddle?
[23:32:35] <whackyMan> ah i found the problem.... what is weird phenomenon,
[23:32:47] <albertosh> :)
[23:33:47] <whackyMan> albertosh: it turns out there is white spaces in the reponse string. even though on the server side the variable is just $reponse = 'OK'; echo $response; exit;
[23:34:26] <angvp> whackyMan: do some trim? ;)
[23:34:30] <whackyMan> albertosh: for some reason white spaces is getting added in front of string so it looks like "      OK";
[23:34:55] <whackyMan> angvp: yeah i had to do trim for it to work. don't know why white spaces are added in front.
[23:36:36] <whackyMan> maybe iam suppose to json encode it before i echo it, and then json decode in the client-side
[23:37:39] <whackyMan> anyone know about this?
[23:46:58] <ckknight> Anyone know of a nice-looking timezone picker for jQuery (or just regular Javascript)?
