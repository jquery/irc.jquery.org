[00:00:06] <rummik> So the little red placeholder jumps all over the place, instead of going in the right place
[00:00:46] <rummik> I'm jusing latest jQuery and jQuery UI
[00:02:55] <zChris> i cant drag it rummik :P
[00:03:02] <DofLeFou> https://gist.github.com/1587756
[00:03:18] <DofLeFou> I m trying to capture the on selected val change for a select option as followed. But the following does not work in IE or FF .. any ideas? work fine in Safari
[00:04:06] <rummik> zChris: Odd O.o
[00:04:21] <rummik> zChris: How about here?
[00:04:25] <rummik> http://jsfiddle.net/rummik/EejaV/
[00:04:36] <Cork> DofLeFou: what the heck is .attr('value', Value) meant to do?
[00:04:43] <rummik> Needs to be grabbed on the labels
[00:05:29] <rummik> I, uh, haven't gotten around to handles.  Just realized it gets glitchy <.<;  Nested sortable is the upper-right darker area
[00:05:55] <Cork> DofLeFou: anyway, if #AddIsLocal is a select box change is triggered on .blur
[00:05:55] <DofLeFou> Cork : u meant here if ($('#AddIsLocal').attr('value', Value).val() == 'Yes') {
[00:06:04] <Cork> DofLeFou: yes
[00:06:22] <DofLeFou> but that work on Safari
[00:06:37] <zChris> rummik, when i drag ut upwards it want to be on left and when i drag it down on the same element without moving to any sides it switch to right. If that helps :P
[00:06:44] <DofLeFou> i m testing my code with different browser
[00:07:04] <Cork> DofLeFou: a bit hard to tell with a dead code bin, but if what i guess is true, then safari isn't following spec
[00:07:15] <rummik> zChris: Not really, no ^^;
[00:07:45] <zChris> rummik: :)
[00:07:54] <DofLeFou> Cork: $('#AddIsLocal').change(function () {
[00:07:54] <DofLeFou>         if ($('#AddIsLocal').attr('value', Value).val() == 'Yes') {
[00:08:14] <Cork> ?
[00:08:52] <DofLeFou> u r saying that  i should be looking at .blur
[00:08:53] <DofLeFou> n not .change
[00:08:59] <Cork> no
[00:09:23] <Cork> i'm saying that .change is triggered when the element loses focus (onblur)
[00:09:53] <Cork> IF the element is a <select> element that is
[00:10:06] <Cork> but as i can't tell from your code, i'n only guessing
[00:10:12] <Cork> *i'm
[00:10:34] <mindis|wurk> ".attr('value', Value).val()" what? :S
[00:10:40] <Cork> ya...
[00:10:45] <Cork> i didn't get that one either
[00:11:22] <DofLeFou> Here is what the #AddIsLocal https://gist.github.com/1587756
[00:11:25] <mindis|wurk> besides, wasn't the current recommendation to always use .val() where supported
[00:11:36] <Cork> DofLeFou: make a pb on jsfiddle instead
[00:11:50] <Cork> DofLeFou: helping on github pb's sucks

[00:16:05] <makeshiftwings> Hello all. I have the following set up. <div><div1><div2><div3></div> etc... I would like, on refreshing, divs 1-3 to be randomized... meaning it could go 213, 321, etc... Any ideas?
[00:16:49] <Cork> man i love when this happens...
[00:17:01] * Cork loads an older browser
[00:18:03] <Cork> DofLeFou: ok. looks like i remembered wrong...
[00:18:13] <Cork> change is triggered on change for selectboxes
[00:18:23] <Cork> DofLeFou: anyway, it works for me
[00:18:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7EdqD/3/
[00:18:52] <Cork> DofLeFou: but it looks more and more like something to do with attr('value', Value)
[00:18:59] <Cork> what is that meant to do?
[00:19:04] <Cork> it doesn't make any sence
[00:19:28] <DofLeFou> grab the value of attr Value
[00:19:43] <mindis|wurk> grab it with just .val() :|
[00:19:46] <Cork> uh it doens't
[00:19:52] <DofLeFou> option value="Yes"
[00:20:04] <Cork> DofLeFou: it tries to set the attribute "value" from a variable Value
[00:20:18] <Cork> and then read the just set value with val()
[00:20:42] <Cork> and thats what doesn't make sence
[00:21:02] <DofLeFou> u meant some like this $('#AddIsLocal').val()
[00:21:10] <Cork> ya
[00:21:22] <Cork> the attr part should prob not be there
[00:24:33] <GyroB> hello everyone

[00:30:42] <lb> hi folks, how to use a jquery ui  custom theme in a webpage subset, that already have a default theme enabled?
[00:30:43] <innociv> I have some simple code that I can't figure out why it's not working. Saying data is null on the last line.  Settings = {}; Settings.data = new Object();  Settings.get = function(setting, value){ Settings.data[setting] = value; }
[00:30:54] <innociv> data should be {}, an object, not null..
[00:31:40] <innociv> Oh I think I see.
[00:37:56] <sasori> what's the correct selector for getting the "id" of the <input> type of element ?
[00:38:40] <Cork> attr('id') ?
[00:38:44] <sasori> let's say there's a given name for the input <input type="text" name="test" id="id")
[00:38:49] <sasori> how to get the id ?
[00:39:13] <Cork> $('input[name="test"]').attr('id')
[00:39:23] <sasori> thanks Cork :)

[00:56:57] <xec> anyone know how/if i can change current location (address) without reloading?
[00:57:08] <Cork> no you can't
[00:57:28] <Cork> html5 has a history object you can do some of it with
[00:57:33] <Cork> but its not cross browser yet
[00:58:12] <xec> github appears to do something like this
[00:58:22] <Cork> through histiry ya
[00:58:25] <xec> aha
[00:58:32] <Cork> it doesn't work in browsers that doesn't support it though
[00:58:33] <xec> how does that work
[00:58:40] <Cork> like ie
[00:58:49] <xec> even 9?
[00:58:57] <Cork> think so
[00:59:21] <Cork> ff3.6 doens't support it either
[01:00:02] <xec> i don't care about old versions, as this is for an internal app
[01:00:42] <xec> but i was hoping for ie9 support =/
[01:02:24] <Cork> xec: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history

[01:02:50] <Cork> chrome 5, ff4, ie-, opera11.50, sarfari5
[01:03:12] <xec> yeah
[01:03:28] <xec> it's always IE giving me headaches
[01:03:43] <Cork> its the purpos in life
[01:03:51] <Cork> to scruw web-developers over
[01:04:41] <shesek> xec, internal application, and you don't drop IE support?
[01:04:44] <shesek> w00t? oO
[01:04:59] <xec> what can I say, it's a ms shop =(
[01:05:36] <shesek> the thing I like most about developing intranet apps is that I don't care about IE
[01:05:53] <shesek> ... switch them over to Chrome? :P
[01:06:11] <shesek> well, I'm really sorry for you ::-\
[01:06:15] <shesek> s/::/:
[01:06:46] <xec> you know what I *will* do - i will add features for non-ie users
[01:07:04] <xec> maybe they will start to switch
[01:07:12] <xec> if not, screw them :P
[01:08:52] <shesek> xec, you can, however, manipulate the hash portion of the URL without a refresh
[01:08:55] <shesek> which works in all browsers
[01:09:00] <xec> haha, for fun i googled "the purpose of internet explorer is" (with quotes) and all 3 results are "..is to download other browsers"
[01:09:17] <shesek> :-)
[01:09:22] <Cork> lol
[01:09:29] <sasori> question: is this a correct selector $('input[name="addtocart"]').val();    for getting the value of an input field that has a name "addtocart" ?
[01:09:31] <shesek> and I feel awful having to use IE, even just for downloading other browsers
[01:09:44] <Cork> sasori: yes
[01:09:51] <sasori> cool.tnx
[01:09:54] <shesek> I should start carrying Firefox/Chrome on a flash disk for when I install a Windows machine
[01:10:13] <Cork> shesek: you can always use wget :)
[01:10:16] <xec> surely they must be available on some ftp?
[01:10:33] <Cork> and ya, the console ftp works too :D
[01:10:41] <shesek> Cork, and how would I get wget installed on Windows?
[01:10:54] <Cork> shesek: who uses windows ;P
[01:10:58] <shesek> and I'm not going to remember the full URL of the download
[01:11:06] <Cork> shesek: but ya, ftp works
[01:11:11] * shesek is a proud Linux user
[01:11:14] <xec> you can browse using ftp client
[01:11:27] <xec> just need to know the server name
[01:11:29] <shesek> ... but I do install Windows from times to times, for family members 'n stuff
[01:11:38] <sasori> am getting a blank as value no matter what i put inside the input field..the html code was value=""  ...do i need to put something in that front-end value attrib ?
[01:11:45] <sasori> or echo out something ?
[01:11:55] <shesek> yeah, I should probably just do that
[01:12:09] <shesek> than I won't have to see IE ever again!
[01:12:17] <shesek> well, except for on testling :-(
[01:14:21] <shesek> hrr, browserling, that is
[01:15:24] <xec> ?demo @ sasori
[01:15:25] <bot-t1> sasori, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.

While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:18:56] <shesek> Try to replicate your problem, in a way that we can see it, on jsfiddle
[01:19:00] <shesek> with as minimum code as needed
[01:20:41] <xec> sasori: there isn't going to be a value in the field when you do the ajax at page load
[01:21:02] <sasori> xec: what should i do ?
[01:21:19] <xec> sasori: what is the ajax supposed to do
[01:21:31] <xec> sasori: send the value from the field?
[01:21:54] <sasori> xec: it supposed to , get the id and value of the item that has its "add to cart" button clicked
[01:22:04] <xec> oh i see
[01:22:07] <sasori> if am not mistaken , I need to use "this" in jquery ?
[01:22:11] <sasori> but where and how ? XD
[01:23:33] <xec> i didnt see the button
[01:24:18] <sasori> because it's a custom image
[01:24:46] <sasori> I only added the class="addtocart" to have a basis when i use jquery in clicking it
[01:26:09] <xec> do
[01:26:20] <xec> do you have firebug or some other console?
[01:26:30] <sasori> yes i do have firebug
[01:26:42] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/xTveT/5/
[01:26:59] <xec> check the console when you click the button
[01:27:10] <sasori> ok
[01:27:22] <xec> that is the id and value you're after right?
[01:27:45] <sasori> yes , exactly
[01:28:03] <xec> .prev() just gets the previous element in the dom, so this depends on the html structure to stay the same
[01:28:13] <xec> but at least its now relative to the button
[01:28:27] <xec> rather than set statically on page load
[01:29:24] <sasori> awesome..thanks xec :D
[01:29:27] <sasori> it worked
[01:29:35] <xec> np :)
[01:30:12] <xec> "this" inside a click event handler refers to the element it is bound to
[01:32:35] <sasori> ok
[01:32:44] <xec> sasori: for more sturdy code (not depending on the input being next to the button) you could search for the .closest() parent the button and the input have in common, and then .find() the input
[01:33:08] <sasori> ok, noted
[01:38:12] <AdvoWork> anyone know how i can get a calendar/datepicker working onclick of a hyperlink?
[01:38:39] <helllen> I would like to limit the number caracters allowed in an input text field?
[01:38:47] <helllen> I would like to allow only numbers
[01:40:35] <rgr> And goof
[01:41:20] <rgr> AdvoWork: On a hyperlink? Or just a hotspot?
[01:41:41] <rgr> helllen: Basic HTML
[01:43:14] <helllen> for the numbers probably is easy but I would like to check in other input it is a valid ip
[01:45:38] <dean__> I'm having an issue with iE6 and jQuery 1.7.1 using the $("a").on("click", funcname) handler. If i return false in function funcname() { } it just goes to the link
[01:46:13] <dean__> I've tried passing in the event to funcname(event) and preventing bubbling using event.preventDefault() before return false, but the manual says returning false should do all this anyway
[01:52:17] <neG_> hi
[01:52:34] <neG_> how to re-fire an event?
[01:53:23] <neG_> like when someone changes selectbox option it triggers function, i pass event variable to function and like to call that same event again?
[02:04:06] <dean__> nobody can help :D?
[02:07:58] <Sonderblade> dean__: i dontk now if it makes any difference, but you could use $("a").click(funcname) instead
[02:08:19] <dean__> Sonderblade, it makes a big difference. I need to use live events :)
[02:08:41] <dean__> Links are dynamically added to the page, hence the need for the on/off functions (new versions of live/die)
[02:08:45] <mindis|wurk> just add an IE6 check that tells the user to upgrade or gtfo >;P
[02:09:21] <mindis|wurk> all sites should do that in fact
[02:12:37] <fatninja> I want to do something like this
[02:12:39] <fatninja> 		rules			: window[($this).attr('name')+'Rules'],
[02:12:39] <fatninja> 		messages		: window[($this).attr('name')+'Messages']
[02:12:40] <Sonderblade> dean__: oh right, well that could make a big difference
[02:12:42] <fatninja> in the validation class
[02:12:45] <fatninja> but it does not work
[02:13:01] <dean__> mindis|wurk, unfortunately that's not a choice for our corporate customer right now
[02:13:09] <dean__> Alas, I am still looking for a solution :)
[02:13:11] <fatninja> if I put rules: loginRules, messages: loginMessages , it works, using window doesn't ,
[02:13:29] <fatninja> is there a way to make a string act as a variable ?
[02:14:13] <Sonderblade> dean__: have you seen http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ie6-click-event-known-bug and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3315?
[02:14:55] <dean__> Nope, but that's a different bug (also 3 years old :p)
[02:14:58] <dean__> Thank s for trying though ;)
[02:21:09] <fatninja> i have $(form).validate({ … }); , where the dots are, can someone explain to me how can I access $(form) attributes ?
[02:23:34] <sqon> $(form).attr("bla")
[02:23:40] <innociv> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/fixedtableheader Um.. I don't see how to download
[02:27:29] <fatninja> sqon : what if I had more elements
[02:27:38] <fatninja> it wouldn't work
[02:27:46] <fatninja> that was just an abstract example
[02:27:51] <fatninja> I want to access that specific element
[02:28:52] <sqon> just assign an id to your element
[02:30:01] <mindis|wurk> or store a reference to it in a variable
[02:30:12] <texinwien> fatninja: $(this).children() will return all child elements of the form
[02:30:39] <texinwien> fatninja: if you'll go into a little more detail about what you want to do, it might help.
[02:31:20] <fatninja> texinwien: I want to standardize my form and for the validation I have something like this
[02:31:33] <fatninja> $(.myForms).validate( { bla bla bla } ) ;
[02:31:44] <fatninja> the thing is, I have specific rules for different forms, example :
[02:32:14] <sqon> fyi remember " "
[02:32:31] <fatninja> every form has name="whatevername" , in jquery I have whatevernameRules: { bla bla } ; whatevernameMessages : {bla bla };
[02:33:40] <sqon> fatninja: $("#Thatismyspecificform").find("input[name=whatever]")
[02:33:56] <fatninja> I don't even know if a single validation can handle multiple forms at once
[02:33:59] <fatninja> hmm..
[02:34:13] <fatninja> sqon:  that was not the point here
[02:34:13] <texinwien> fatninja: Have you taken a look at this plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation ?
[02:34:25] <fatninja> texinwien: for 5 days, yes
[02:34:30] <texinwien> :D
[02:34:36] <texinwien> doesn't handle your needs?
[02:35:00] <fatninja> of course , it's the best, but I need to rethink my standardization , because it can be done slightly different
[02:37:42] <texinwien> well, you can use something like $(this).find(':text, textarea, [@type='hidden'], :radio, :checkbox');
[02:46:03] <shwaiil> hi
[03:00:29] <rahmen> Hi! I have a input with type "range". It should go from a to b, b>a. But some intervals should not exist. An example: The range should go from 0 to 100 but when slided it should skip the values between 20 and 30. I need a dynamic solution since this will differ from time to time. I haven't found any attributes for this - is there any? If not, does anyone know another solution? Thanks!
[03:24:41] <Jeroenem> Hi, im using jquery.tipsy to display some tooltips. It uses the text in the title attr. and display it in a nice way. Now i want to only display tooltips to title attr. which have text. Empty attr. shouldnt be triggered... i tried this but it wont work.. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/znCnd/
[03:30:51] <MoTiOnXml> i'm having an issue with an attribute selector that matches not-empty values: .on("contextmenu", "*[data-jsonID!='']", function(e) {..}
[03:31:01] <MoTiOnXml> it
[03:31:17] <MoTiOnXml> it's not filtering empty elements as expected
[03:32:03] <MoTiOnXml> anyone seen this before?
[03:32:45] <xec> MoTiOnXml: "contextmenu" is an event?
[03:32:51] <MoTiOnXml> xec: yes
[03:33:01] <MoTiOnXml> doesn't matter, it's the selector that makes a fuzz
[03:33:22] <MoTiOnXml> it's not the - in the attribute-name either
[03:33:50] <xec> any reason you put the * in there?
[03:34:00] <MoTiOnXml> clarity
[03:34:22] <MoTiOnXml> doesn't make a difference
[03:34:53] <innociv> Is there something that combines filter and find together?
[03:34:58] <innociv> Searching both the upper level and children.
[03:35:18] <MoTiOnXml> xec: weird, right? :)
[03:35:24] <quicksilver> MoTiOnXml: [data-jsonID!=''] will match if the attribute is entirely absent.
[03:35:32] <quicksilver> have you tested the seletor alone outside of an on?
[03:35:45] <recentlydeceased> hi folks, using mutliple autocomplete instance on one page, and want the selection on the first instance to effect what is shown in the second.  At present the first instance gets a bunch of companies returned via json, the second gets a bunch of contacts again via json...
[03:35:59] <mindis|wurk> does it? i thought != wasn't even a valid css operator
[03:36:11] <MoTiOnXml> quicksilver: didn't think of that (entirely absent); i want to check if the value of data-jsonID is not ""
[03:36:27] <recentlydeceased> I want to filter the second instances results based on the id of the business selected from the first autocomplete.  Any help? Pretty new to jquery, etc.
[03:36:27] <MoTiOnXml> quicksilver: i.e. has a {..} stringified json object inside of it
[03:36:38] <xec> MoTiOnXml: yes, i agree, i can't get it working either: http://jsfiddle.net/Th8Cr/
[03:37:09] <MoTiOnXml> xec: was hoping i could get a clue here - looks pretty darn ugly, with a chained filter :/
[03:37:19] <MoTiOnXml> quicksilver: perhaps you could enlighten us here?
[03:38:22] <xec> aahg
[03:38:24] <xec> i get it
[03:38:25] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/Th8Cr/1/
[03:38:41] <MoTiOnXml> xec: the quotes? really?
[03:38:45] <xec> no
[03:38:54] <xec> check if it exists
[03:39:08] <MoTiOnXml> ah, ofcourse
[03:39:19] <quicksilver> xec: still don't understand why !="test" matches test though..
[03:39:38] <MoTiOnXml> xec: yes, repro here - works, thanks :)
[03:40:04] <MoTiOnXml> quicksilver: i guess the absense of the attribute is also a true result
[03:40:30] <quicksilver> it is, MoTiOnXml, that's what I was saying first of all
[03:40:50] <quicksilver> however, it doesn't explain why [data-jsonID!="test"] alone matches when the attribute is present and *is* test
[03:41:00] <MoTiOnXml> quicksilver: doh, i see that now - sorry about that, and \o for the rescue :)
[03:41:02] <xec> quicksilver, MoTiOnXml: i agree, it's strange, check out http://jsfiddle.net/Th8Cr/2/
[03:41:13] <quicksilver> xec's fix/workaround fixes this other problem too
[03:41:17] <quicksilver> but it seems weird
[03:41:36] <innociv> Why is there nothing that searches both filter and find together?
[03:41:39] <innociv> I don't know what to do :|
[03:41:40] <quicksilver> xec: exactly
[03:41:54] <xec> smells like a bug to me
[03:41:58] <quicksilver> innociv: your question doesn't make sense to me. Can you be more clear?
[03:42:07] <MoTiOnXml> xec: would you file the bug?
[03:42:20] <innociv> I need to search both by filter and find.
[03:42:22] <innociv> Not one or the other.
[03:42:37] <xec> MoTiOnXml: i'm not entirely sure it is one, yet
[03:42:38] <innociv> I need to traverse all children and the selected elements themself
[03:42:50] <xec> MoTiOnXml: but it seems strange indeed
[03:42:57] <MoTiOnXml> surely your test proves it's a bug
[03:43:11] <MoTiOnXml> otherwise, the use of !=<value> is completely bogus
[03:44:44] <Jeroenem> Im using jquery.tipsy to display some tooltips. It uses the text in the title attr. and display it in a nice way. Now i want to only display tooltips to title attr. which have text. Empty attr. shouldnt be triggered... i tried this but it wont work.. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/znCnd/
[03:45:50] <xec> innociv: you could temporarily create an element, stick everything in it and then use .find()
[03:45:58] <quicksilver> innociv: well $('div,div *') should be all divs and all their descendents.
[03:46:05] <quicksilver> for example.
[03:46:11] <innociv> I found another way around it.
[03:46:24] <innociv> quicksilver, i'm searching a cached selection.
[03:46:54] <quicksilver> $(foo).add($(foo).find('*'));
[03:47:01] <quicksilver> where foo is your previous selection
[03:47:13] <quicksilver> foo.add(foo.find('*')), indeed
[03:47:21] <quicksilver> if it's already a jQ objet
[03:54:11] <Saaadi> hey guys

[04:08:30] <pyarun> Hi guys!! i am trying to Use jquery dialog box, i dont want the title bar, i just want to get a container where i can place my contents, is ti possible
[04:11:07] <innociv> How can I, every time cachedSelector is manipulated, have the same exact thing performed to aDifferentCachedSelector? ;/
[04:11:33] <harryhcs> hi there. I'm loading my scripts with LAB.js and using Backbone.js router for my routing of my app. Im also using jquery tmpl as my templating method, Now, I have a template with a link in it, once the main page loads, that template gets added to the #content element, so there is the link but its not clickable. why is this?
[04:12:11] <innociv> http://www.mustafaozcan.net/en/demo/fixedtableheader/jquery-fixedtableheader-demo-en.html I'm trying to do this to some headers, but I have so many things manipulating and listening on the header part.
[04:12:53] <IvanKuzev> pyarun : you cant do that with jquery ui dialog...but you can with simple fixed positioned <div>
[04:14:13] <pyarun> IvanKuzev: Thanks, in that case, i will have to write all the functionallity of Model Box?
[04:16:18] <IvanKuzev> modal you mean?
[04:17:20] <IvanKuzev> IvanKuzev : and yeah you will have to....i might help if you want
[04:24:24] <mightym> hey guys, I'm new to jquery, and wonder how to solve this: i have a div with child elements in it (like a form), i want the div to be hided when clicking on the body, but not on clicking on itself or its childs. what i have right now is only for the parent div but not for its childs: http://pastie.org/3159899 maybe someone has a hint for me
[04:25:45] <harryhcs> hi there. I'm loading my scripts with LAB.js and using Backbone.js router for my routing of my app. Im also using jquery tmpl as my templating method, Now, I have a template with a link in it, once the main page loads, that template gets added to the #content element, so there is the link but its not clickable. why is this?
[04:26:17] <versac> hello ^^
[04:37:11] <mightym> or maybe someone can tell me at least how i could aware that the child doesn't belong to a parent with the given id like: $(e.target).parent('#the-settings').length>0
[04:39:42] <quicksilver> that looks right mightym, for immediate parent
[04:39:54] <quicksilver> for ancestor you might want .parents()
[04:40:57] <mightym> quicksilver: i tried both, but its not working, the click events is still fired on #the-settings children
[04:41:29] <quicksilver> well that is a correct way to check for an ancestor
[04:41:32] <quicksilver> your probably is something else
[04:41:40] <quicksilver> http://jsfiddle.net/gV8T7/
[04:41:43] <mightym> this is how i check it http://pastie.org/3159973
[04:42:37] <quicksilver> you want that *not* to fire if clicked on #the-settings or any of its children?
[04:43:17] <mightym> yes
[04:43:22] <quicksilver> your logic is wrong.
[04:43:25] <quicksilver> you want an &&
[04:43:37] <quicksilver> and you have a missing not
[04:43:43] <mightym> oh
[04:43:50] <mightym> :-( ill check
[04:43:52] <quicksilver> if (e.target.id!='the-settings' && !($(e.target).parents('#the-settings').length>0))
[04:43:58] <quicksilver> is what I think you mean.
[04:44:21] <LordThumper> Is it normal for a ui-sortable-helper to stick around after a Sortable has finished sorting?
[04:45:29] <Kingsy> with the jquery ui tabs.. how do you decide which tab is displayed on load ?
[04:47:07] <Douglish> Hello everybody, is there any strightforward way how to select all divs but exclude those whose have class 'ignore' and also exclude all child elements of those divs?
[04:47:13] <Douglish> Kingsy: use option selected.
[04:49:06] <Kingsy> Douglish: option selected?
[04:49:12] <mightym> quicksilver: thx a lot for your help!
[04:49:27] <Douglish> Kingsy: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#option-selected
[04:51:49] <Kingsy> Douglish: not sure I understand I thought option selected was used to retrieve the id of the currently selected tab.. not to tell it to start with a perticular tab selected
[04:52:14] <Kingsy> and I cant see anything else in that link
[04:52:44] <Kingsy> Douglish: i.e var selected = $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected'); gets the index of the currently selected tab
[04:53:18] <Douglish> Kingsy: Yes, but there is also $( ".selector" ).tabs({ selected: 3 })
[04:53:58] <Douglish> And if I'm not wrong, but maybe I'm, it should be what you need. :)
[04:55:39] <Kingsy> Douglish: bang on! thanks man
[04:56:37] <Douglish> Kingsy: You're welcome.
[05:03:02] <harryhcs> why would a link not be clickable? is it not added to the dom?
[05:04:20] <aaronmcadam> a link is not clickable without a href attr
[05:04:29] <harryhcs> its got that
[05:04:55] <harryhcs> the link is in a jquery tmpl template, and then added to a element .html(template)
[05:05:05] <harryhcs> and that link is just there, can't click it
[05:09:03] <harryhcs> no ine?
[05:09:05] <harryhcs> one*
[05:09:34] <AdvoWork> anyone know how i can get a calendar/datepicker working onclick of a hyperlink?
[05:10:42] <sqon> AdvoWork: you want a hyperlink to show datepicker ?
[05:11:12] <LordThumper> Is there any way to get text of an element as it is displayed?
[05:11:16] <harryhcs> use jqueryUI
[05:11:30] <LordThumper> $(element).text() is giving me the original text of the element as it is supposed to do
[05:11:33] <harryhcs> $("element").text()
[05:11:59] <LordThumper> However the text is displayed different with overflow:hidden, and text-overflow:ellipsis
[05:12:11] <LordThumper> So text like "This is a test" is displayed as "This is a t..."
[05:12:20] <LordThumper> Is there any way to get the second value?
[05:13:04] <harryhcs> you could edit the string manually, like remove the let couple of X characters and replace it with "..."
[05:13:34] <harryhcs> that should be a fixed number of chars in the string where it cuts it off
[05:14:01] <LordThumper> That would be kinda painful to do
[05:14:12] <LordThumper> Dynamic data/div width
[05:14:49] <harryhcs> sure there is a plugin for this, i know its easy with python. not sure in js
[05:15:49] <harryhcs> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3358700/how-to-cut-the-string-in-javascript-so-that-it-fits-exactly-two-lines-add
[05:18:23] <AdvoWork> sqon, yeah thats what im after
[05:19:08] <harryhcs> AdvoWork:use queryUI, its got all that
[05:19:17] <harryhcs> jqueryUI
[05:19:47] <LordThumper> Thanks harryhcs
[05:19:57] <harryhcs> np
[05:22:54] <jita> Any idea why i get 500 error http://dpaste.org/4Kc7a/, if i use GET, it works fine
[05:25:19] <harryhcs> jita: what does your debug code in django say?
[05:26:19] <jita> harryhcs, it just says 500 internal server error
[05:26:36] <harryhcs> is this on your local server?
[05:26:44] <jita> harryhcs, yes
[05:26:55] <sqon> jita: do you have any htaccess configuration ?
[05:27:01] <harryhcs> it should show you debug information
[05:27:23] <jita> harryhcs, but its the ajax request, it would not show the debug information, how can i access it ?
[05:27:36] <jita> sqon, i am using django test server
[05:28:00] <harryhcs> in console you can see it
[05:28:39] <harryhcs> it will show the html from django debug in the console
[05:29:36] <jita> harryhcs, this is the only thing shown in the console [10/Jan/2012 13:09:28] "POST /drinks/recipe/red-apple/like HTTP/1.1" 500 74549
[05:29:53] <harryhcs> so click on that and it should show the html in the console log
[05:29:59] <harryhcs> what browser?
[05:30:03] <threeseven> total noob question here, how do i get the "datetime" field from this thing "http://json-time.appspot.com/time.json" and display it on a web page in a way that i can style with css?
[05:30:50] <jita> harryhcs, i cant click on it :( i am using chrome
[05:31:43] <harryhcs> mmm, ok so think you need to debug in the def recipe_like() function, see where it breaks. so print shit out before you do anything, then go deeper and deeper till it does not break no more
[05:31:50] <harryhcs> then you know where its breaking
[05:32:18] <harryhcs> or use FireFox, you can see the HTML in the console log, with firebug
[05:32:26] <harryhcs> the you can see the django error
[05:33:19] <threeseven> anyone? please?
[05:34:01] <harryhcs> threeseven, set that to a var, so var foo = {
[05:34:01] <harryhcs>   "datetime": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 13:33:47 +0000",
[05:34:02] <harryhcs> }
[05:34:03] <harryhcs> etc:etc
[05:34:44] <harryhcs> then then do foo.datetime
[05:35:35] <jita> harryhcs, seems like the it does not even reaches the view, it i cant print even the first statement in the view
[05:35:36] <harryhcs> threeseven http://dpaste.org/9wC57/
[05:35:46] <jita> harryhcs, probably something with jquery code
[05:36:27] <harryhcs> jita: so you can't print out before any of the if request = "POST" etc ?
[05:36:40] <jita> harryhcs, nope
[05:36:52] <harryhcs> is your urls right for that view?
[05:36:59] <jita> harryhcs, GET works fine
[05:37:07] <harryhcs> oh
[05:37:09] <harryhcs> yes
[05:37:57] <threeseven> well that make sense
[05:38:06] <threeseven> it's the other part that i don't know how to do
[05:38:21] <threeseven> how do i get the json object from the website
[05:38:31] <threeseven> into my js into a variable
[05:38:42] <harryhcs> jita: in chrome console: click on the error, then click on the icon on the left, it will then show you the HTML and the debug code
[05:39:23] <harryhcs> threeseven: so you want to get that json file form that server?
[05:39:30] <harryhcs> threeseven why?
[05:39:52] <threeseven> all i want to do right now
[05:39:57] <harryhcs> jita: i just did it with chrome
[05:40:09] <threeseven> is print GMT time to a website
[05:40:10] <threeseven> like
[05:40:13] <jita> harryhcs, yeah i got it, thanks a lotl
[05:40:23] <threeseven> just have a page that displays GMT time
[05:40:26] <harryhcs> jita: cool
[05:40:55] <threeseven> nothing fancy at all
[05:41:03] <harryhcs> threeseven whats your time zone?
[05:41:26] <threeseven> why?
[05:41:34] <harryhcs> is it the same as GMT?
[05:41:36] <threeseven> it's -8
[05:41:38] <threeseven> no
[05:41:49] <threeseven> and i want it to be independent of the client
[05:42:02] <threeseven> that's why i'm using that json time thing
[05:42:13] <threeseven> so regardless of the time on your computer
[05:42:16] <threeseven> it's still accurate
[05:42:20] <jita> harryhcs, it was some trailing URL slash issue, thanks again
[05:43:24] <harryhcs> jita: awesome man
[05:44:32] <harryhcs> threeseven: are you using only js? or do you have some server side?
[05:45:21] <threeseven> i guess i thought taking a json object and printing out a value from it would be incredibly trivial
[05:45:57] <threeseven> i don't really know anything about js
[05:46:39] <harryhcs> it would be super easy with something like python or php to get the json object and pass it to front end js
[05:47:09] <threeseven> but i've seen like http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[05:47:17] <threeseven> that seems to get json from ficker
[05:47:20] <threeseven> and print out cats
[05:47:33] <harryhcs> yea but seems this domain does not allow that. the server can deny those requests
[05:47:42] <threeseven> ahhhh
[05:47:49] <threeseven> well then
[05:48:01] <threeseven> i guess it's php
[05:48:13] <threeseven> and then i can just pull time off my own server can't i?
[05:48:30] <harryhcs> i guess so yes
[05:48:31] <threeseven> surely php has something for that
[05:48:37] <LukeNukem> for what?
[05:48:44] <threeseven> getting server time
[05:49:11] <harryhcs> google it...
[05:49:14] <oDesk> hello developers
[05:49:18] <threeseven> yeah i will
[05:49:20] <harryhcs> js had time to...
[05:49:24] <threeseven> not server
[05:49:28] <threeseven> only client
[05:49:37] <harryhcs> yes
[05:49:39] <LukeNukem> harryhcs, what are you trying to do ?
[05:49:59] <threeseven> i don't think he's trying to do anything
[05:50:04] <threeseven> i'm the noob here
[05:50:05] <threeseven> lol
[05:50:21] <harryhcs> LukeNukem: I'm building a single page web app, so loading templates. are we on this or the time thign?
[05:50:22] <harryhcs> mmm
[05:50:37] <LukeNukem> NOW();
[05:50:39] <LukeNukem> :D
[05:50:43] <oDesk> if you guyz were to change only price into this line, how would you do that in jQuery the elegant way   <td id="some"><span>USD</span> 444.00</td>
[05:51:03] <harryhcs> threeseven: do this , http://json-time.appspot.com/time.json?tz=Africa/Harare
[05:51:08] <harryhcs> thats gwt
[05:51:13] <Aquaguy> Hello.
[05:51:15] <harryhcs> and it will work with getJSON
[05:51:33] <harryhcs> no it will not…ah...
[05:52:02] <Aquaguy> Inside a for(x in arr) im calling a $.post, is there any way to pass to the success function arr[x] ?
[05:52:06] <LukeNukem> just use NOW(); function
[05:52:16] <LukeNukem> oh wait, let me clear that
[05:52:30] <harryhcs> who can help me with my problem…? :-(
[05:52:48] <Aquaguy> as the result comes later on, when it access arr[x] it's always the last one
[05:53:03] <burial> anybody knows why my 2 other divs are fading with the last one ? http://jsfiddle.net/a4vkt/
[05:53:14] <CrazyThinker> If I add a javascript using append(), can I call functions in that script soon after the append function gets executed?
[05:53:23] <burial> i want the box with the text to appear always on top
[05:53:32] <LukeNukem> explain your problem
[05:53:38] <harryhcs> mine?
[05:53:43] <harryhcs> lol
[05:53:48] <burial> :D
[05:54:34] <burial> my prob: I want the div with h2 always to be visible, only the background image to be fading as I will add more images to rotate. Here's the demo: http://jsfiddle.net/a4vkt/
[05:54:41] <burial> h1*
[05:55:15] <burial> but everything is fading now, it doesn't metter that the other divs are separate
[05:55:17] <harryhcs> my problem: I am using jquery tmpl for templating. So I'm loading a template into a element, the template contains a <a href="ss">foo</a> link and it puts in in the element, but the link is not clickable. something to do with the dom?
[05:55:20] <oDesk> i think var r=$("#some span");  $("#some").text(r + "22.00");
[05:55:46] <oDesk> but this will not each    r   as it were cloned with tags
[05:56:22] <quicksilver> that will delete the <span>, oDesk
[05:56:23] <oDesk> here is the line if someone following me now  <td id="some"><span>USD</span> 444.00</td>
[05:56:52] <oDesk> quicksilver: how then i can clone the span with tags into r then return it back
[05:56:52] <quicksilver> you can't use .text() that way
[05:57:12] <oDesk> quicksilver: oh, .html()
[05:58:57] <harryhcs> what loads first, HTML and images or scripts and style sheetS?
[05:58:58] <oDesk> quicksilver: but then how to return  r with span tags
[05:59:42] <quicksilver> r.html()
[05:59:47] <quicksilver> but that's a weird way to do it I think
[06:00:08] <oDesk> i might do it like this  var r=$("#some span");  $("#some").text("<span>" + r.text() + "</span>22.00");   i'm looking for elegant way
[06:00:58] <juha_> note to self: firefox sucks
[06:01:00] <xec> harryhcs: it's not quite that simple, html is rendered until a script tag is encountered, then the script is executed before resuming html rendering
[06:01:27] <xec> harryhcs: images are basically loaded last
[06:01:48] <harryhcs> xec: I'm asking cause I'm trying to figure out wtf is wrong in my app…I'm loading a javascript template containing a link, but the link is not clickable
[06:01:52] <harryhcs> not a clue
[06:02:27] <xec> harryhcs: is your app live somewhere?
[06:02:42] <harryhcs> xec, nope
[06:03:07] <xec> harryhcs: can you reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle.net ?
[06:03:18] <harryhcs> ill try, lets see
[06:03:30] <harryhcs> give me a sec, dec, thanks
[06:03:38] <xec> np barry
[06:04:05] <LukeNukem> threeseven, are you trying to echo out the time on the server pc?
[06:04:44] <elb0w> is it ok to do var num = Number($("#elem").html())?
[06:04:54] <anli_> I want a child element that will be clipped by its parent and does not take up any layout space, however, if I set position:absolute, it will not be clipped by the parent
[06:06:54] <anli_> ah, found it, must set parent to position:relative
[06:09:45] <coppa> is there any way to reverse a CSS3 animation
[06:09:50] <coppa> ?
[06:13:23] <rookie84> i have two fancy boxes : 		$('a.analytics').fancybox(); 		$('a.addons').fancybox();
[06:13:34] <rookie84> if i click either one, the other one doesn't get loaded
[06:13:37] <Trudko> guys i have input field whichs value will be changed by some other external javascrtip. I need to detect this change. Can JQuery help me with it?
[06:13:40] <rookie84> like it will not load the 2nd time
[06:13:43] <rookie84> any help with this please?
[06:23:02] <IvanKuzev> rookie84 : the fancybox plugin is not ok.it probably dont work with 2 instances..
[06:23:21] <IvanKuzev> you have to check its code and see if you can fix it...or look for newer version
[06:23:24] <rookie84> hmm any workaround for this?
[06:23:31] <rookie84> i am using the newer version
[06:23:35] <rookie84> any other alternative plugin for this?
[06:23:41] <stevejalim> anyone used jquery-ui draggable with 'collapsed' elements?
[06:23:51] <stevejalim> to reduce the distance stuff has to be dragged
[06:26:24] <JAAulde> Please refresh my memory: which mouse events are the preferred for detecting mouseover and mouseout? There's so many for that area of concern...
[06:26:34] <innociv> mouseenter mouseleave
[06:26:51] <JAAulde> innociv: ok, thanks
[06:28:01] <IvanKuzev> stevejalim:you can use the drag event of the dragable to triger open the colapsed container
[06:29:34] <stevejalim> IvanKuzev: what i want to do is collapse all containers, including the one being dragged, so that the user only has to drag a short way even if some containers normally contain long content. However, it looks like ui's draggable handlers only measure the objects at the start of drag and so you have to drag the collapsed items to where the space between uncollapsed containers USED to be. (If that makes any sense)
[06:32:48] <IvanKuzev> stevejalim: do you have an example?
[06:33:05] <stevejalim> only local dev at the mo
[06:33:13] <stevejalim> and too complex for jsbin
[06:33:53] <IvanKuzev> ok
[06:34:24] <stevejalim> actually, i've just tried refreshPositions:true and it helps
[06:34:29] <stevejalim> but a bit jittery
[06:34:52] <IvanKuzev> stevejalim: did you tried to colapse them at the start event?
[06:35:05] <tolmun> oahi
[06:35:48] <gho5t> Anyone familiar with jqGrid? I want to hook into the gridComplete event after the grid is already initialized, but doing $('#myGrid').jqGrid({ gridComplete: function(){  reinitializes the grid and I have no data
[06:35:48] <stevejalim> IvanKuzev yeah, i collapse them by adding a CSS class to them in the start callback - is there a better way?
[06:35:52] <anli_> ie has no support for @font-face?
[06:35:59] <chx> Hi. Skipping the Drupal bits, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/532834/ is there a better way to write this? I am trying to call a releveant function for each
[06:40:58] <IvanKuzev> stevejalim: not really thats the best there is
[06:41:37] <stevejalim> IvanKuzev that's ok - good to know i'm on track. with refreshPositions it's better, certainly
[06:42:00] <stevejalim> IvanKuzev but sometimes i notice that the first sortable element won't find a drop-target/won't be droppable -- ever come across that ? (Chrome)
[06:44:38] <IvanKuzev> no. sorry. and one warning for refreshPositions...it eats alot of cpu so use it only when you have to and turn it off when you dont need it
[06:46:59] <AdvoWork> I have some very simple code here http://jsfiddle.net/qHvQe/1/ but for some reason, when i click my hyperlink,the first time i do it, nothing happens, the 2nd time i do, it works as expected. Any ideas please?
[06:47:34] <DC1> I could use some help with a function that was written. I cannot seem to get the paths right. This is a php question.
[06:47:43] <DC1> http://pastebin.com/u0W8gdxA
[06:47:44] <anchovy> AdvoWork, because you have a nested click()
[06:48:01] <AdvoWork> ahh fixed, doh, thanks anchovy
[06:48:17] <anchovy> np
[06:48:59] <anchovy> DC1, if this is a php question then ask in #php
[06:49:14] <DC1> php you have to be invited to
[06:49:29] <anchovy> no you don't, you need a registered nickname
[06:49:36] <anchovy> also, use imagemagick instead
[06:53:08] <DC1> any hints on imagmagik ? tutorial ?
[06:53:53] <DC1> or another function I could call?
[06:55:37] <IvanKuzev> dc1: i could not find an error in this code...are you sure you give it correct arguments
[06:56:06] <DC1> yea thats the issue one sec I will give you the error and the param i am using
[06:56:43] <anchovy> DC1, don't use imagick either, use image magick without the imagick wrapper
[06:58:46] <DC1> http://pastebin.com/rU5S2xrR

[07:00:58] <DC1> thanks for the help anchovy
[07:03:50] <sphinxxx> is there a way to see the version of jquery with the jquery object?
[07:04:35] <anchovy> sphinxxx, $().jquery
[07:04:46] <Eviltwin> jQuery.fn.jquery I think
[07:04:47] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[07:05:14] <Eviltwin> But feature detection is usually a better way to go if you can
[07:05:33] <AdvoWork> if im doing $("#datepicker").datepicker("show");   how can i pass extra parameters at the same time? im doing: $('#datePicker').datepicker('setDate', parsedDate);  but it seems to be ignoring it.
[07:07:47] <tommyd> Hi all! I'm looking for a way to globally intercept AJAX requests in jQuery and stumbled upon the ajaxError(), ajaxSuccess(), aso. functions - I noticed however that these are executed _after_ the individual ajax handlers have been executed
[07:08:36] <ben514> the ajax events/callbacks (global handlers), when I get the response (it is type json in firebug) ajaxSuccess returns JSON, however, ajaxError and ajaxComplete do not. Do I HAVE to use the string from xhr.responseText, or am I just doing something wrong?
[07:08:38] <tommyd> ideally I'd like to block / stop the individual handlers if certain conditions are triggered in the global handler
[07:09:45] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: That should work just fine if it's already a datepicker instance
[07:09:48] <Eviltwin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[07:09:54] <Eviltwin> Look at methods
[07:10:27] <XaXoX> hi everyone, I need some help with jQuery, may i get it here?
[07:10:57] <Eviltwin> ben514: Take a peek here http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[07:11:36] <Eviltwin> See if that's what you're looking for
[07:11:56] <Eviltwin> But odds are you're trying to do something very wrong
[07:12:02] <Eviltwin> Err, that was for tommyd
[07:12:41] <sphinxxx> Eviltwin, i'm having a weird issue with fancybox and ajax
[07:12:47] <Trudko> Eviltwin: where did you get your nick?
[07:12:55] <sphinxxx> i have a site that works completely without javascript, and now im making it so its all ajax (no reloads)
[07:12:56] <Trudko> I tend to use the same for some games ...
[07:13:06] <tommyd> Eviltwin: actually not - I try to cope with JAAS container security and spurious HTTP redirects to a login page in a global place :)
[07:13:10] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: I don't regularly work with any plugins so...maybe not you're guy
[07:13:14] <sphinxxx> i used .on  to make all <a> clicks do $.ajax, and on success $.fancybox
[07:13:22] <sphinxxx> :(
[07:13:26] <Eviltwin> But I can try
[07:13:52] <Eviltwin> Trudko: I came up with it about 10 years ago when I first signed on to IRC
[07:14:07] <Eviltwin> As I am actually a twin, it suited me
[07:14:15] <XaXoX> my issue is: i got an ajax request to a php to get some html, it fires and loads correctly and shows the content on page, still when i click on "page source" i don't see the content dynamically loaded. the site tumbledry.com works as mine, but when i click on "page source" it updates with the actual page... how does it work?
[07:14:31] <Trudko> Eviltwin:  heh ok
[07:15:04] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: So what's happening and can you jsFiddle the specific issue?
[07:15:49] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, this is my example: http://jsfiddle.net/qHvQe/3/  so that should work?
[07:16:12] <sphinxxx> Eviltwin, i'm jsfiddling it now, although i don't think it will be fully functional
[07:16:17] <sphinxxx> jsfiddle is soooo slow right now
[07:16:29] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/Bazb9/
[07:17:18] <sphinxxx> it works the first time, but after opening and closing a fancybox, it doesn't
[07:17:29] <sphinxxx> it still gives me "success" (the console log) but doesn't show anything
[07:19:05] <Eviltwin> The examples here show it on an element: http://fancybox.net/howto
[07:19:15] <kanishka> if i get a json responce from the ajax and i need to phrase into html code is there any documentation for it
[07:19:40] <Eviltwin> kanishka: Can't fully understand the question but I think you should see ?.load
[07:19:41] <bot-t1> kanishka, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:19:45] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[07:19:48] <XaXoX> could anyone help? please
[07:19:57] <Eviltwin> kanishka: See this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.load/
[07:20:01] <Eviltwin> Wait
[07:20:05] <ben514> Eviltwin: so i guess the question is, can the "error" callback for a request made NOT evaluate the response as JSON? the "success" callback does this just fine. I have the server always returning JSON. :(
[07:20:07] <sphinxxx> Eviltwin, yea but they're built in way of doing ajax isn't as flexible as i need
[07:20:07] <Eviltwin> I lied this: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:20:19] <sphinxxx> thats why i'm doing it with $.ajax and calling $.fancybox as a method
[07:20:59] <Eviltwin> ben514: Error handler is called if it fails to parse too
[07:21:18] <AdvoWork> jsfiddle is borked by the look of it
[07:21:21] <Eviltwin> You can get the responseText from the jqXHR
[07:21:22] <ben514> hhhm ok something to look into thx
[07:21:32] <faianca> sphinxxx, at the end of the ajax call insert an return false;  still didn't see ur jsfiddle thought
[07:21:52] <sphinxxx> faianca, not functional but here: http://jsfiddle.net/Bazb9/
[07:22:15] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, do you know if my example won't work due to me already creating the datepicker, and im only showing it the 2nd time? or shouldnt that matter
[07:22:16] <ben514> Eviltwin: hhm ok something to look into. but if it isn't malformed JSON, then, in theory, "error" callback would evaluate the response as JSON? (thx for the help)
[07:22:51] <sphinxxx> faianca, holy sh*t i think that fixed it
[07:22:57] <Eviltwin> ben514: If the status code isn't a success, it doesn't try to parse the JSON because it doesn't expect it to be JSON
[07:22:58] <faianca> sphinxxx, :)
[07:23:03] <sphinxxx> brilliant!
[07:23:10] <Eviltwin> But you can still get the text response
[07:23:17] <sphinxxx> faianca, why is that needed
[07:23:17] <Eviltwin> Which you can parse using JSON.parse
[07:23:24] <sphinxxx> i already do e.preventDefault()
[07:23:31] <ben514> Eviltwin: ok.. so i would need to evaluate it manually, i'm guessing
[07:23:40] <Eviltwin> ...yes...
[07:23:44] <ben514> Eviltwin: Right... I can use JSON.parse thx
[07:23:47] <Eviltwin> By adding ONE function call
[07:23:53] <faianca> sphinxxx, well to stop any kind of propagation
[07:24:05] <Eviltwin> I just got through saying how it didn't parse for you if it was an error
[07:24:11] <kanishka> Eviltwin:  i need to phrase json into a html code ..
[07:24:18] <ben514> Eviltwin: thx for the help
[07:24:41] <sphinxxx> now i'm using $("body").on("click", "a", function(e){   but how can I apply it only do <a class="ajax">
[07:24:50] <sphinxxx> $("body").on("click", "a.ajax", function(e){   didn't work
[07:25:26] <faianca> sphinxxx,  $('.ajax').click(function
[07:26:32] <NoiseEee> no faianca
[07:26:51] <LordThumper> If Events are propagated up the DOM, would the sibling of the element that fired that event get the event?
[07:27:05] <NoiseEee> LordThumper: no just the parent(s)
[07:27:10] <LordThumper> Ah thanks
[07:27:13] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: The ancestors
[07:27:39] <LordThumper> Ok cheers
[07:27:56] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, are you aware of anything that would stop $('#datePicker').datepicker('setDate', queryDate); working?  ive even removed the parse date bit, no errors, but the date wont set? http://jsfiddle.net/qHvQe/6/
[07:28:04] <sphinxxx> faianca, i need .on  because elements get pulled in through ajax, and  then i need the .click event handled on them as well
[07:28:14] <sphinxxx> kind of have to think about it recursively, hurts the head a bit
[07:28:16] <kanishka> http://jsfiddle.net/kanishkablack/sM7W7/1/ i need to set up a stream like this one, i get json from yahoo pipes . how to covert or phrase  the json into html code ...
[07:28:59] <faianca> sphinxxx, i always use $('.ajax').live('click', function() for that kind of sorcery
[07:29:04] <prgmctan> am I able to do preventDefault and then window.location later?
[07:29:11] <Eviltwin> faianca: Don't use .live, use .delegate or .on
[07:29:16] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[07:29:25] <faianca> Eviltwin, =O in which version?
[07:29:37] <Eviltwin> Since delegate came to be
[07:29:51] <Eviltwin> Well
[07:29:58] <Eviltwin> It's been officially deprecated since 1.7
[07:30:13] <Eviltwin> But as soon as .delegate came around, I considered it deprecated
[07:30:23] <faianca> i see, cheers didn't saw it
[07:31:36] <Eviltwin> $(document).delegate("{foo}", "{event}", function() { ... }) does the exact same thing as $("{foo}").live("{event}", function() { ... });
[07:31:39] <Eviltwin> But more efficiently
[07:32:35] <Eviltwin> But it also gives you the ability to scope tighter
[07:32:42] <Eviltwin> By changing that "document" to something else
[07:32:52] <faianca> yeah
[07:33:28] <LordThumper> If I applied "box-shadow" css style using $(element).css("box-shadow","xxx"), would jQuery apply correct version of css according to the browser (ex. -webkit,-moz), or just apply the css style blindly
[07:33:29] <LordThumper> ?
[07:34:07] <snover> LordThumper: the latter.
[07:34:54] <snover> the irony of that statement being that box-shadow is one of the ones that does not require a prefix
[07:35:04] <LordThumper> Ah, then I probably should generate/apply a css rule on the fly
[07:35:30] <snover> you probably should use cssHooks and/or modernizr
[07:36:01] <LordThumper> Found some rules using "-moz-box-shadow", maybe older browsers required the prefix
[07:36:25] <LordThumper> Will give modernizr a look thanks
[07:38:40] <anli_> To use foo.html(div) where div already is child of element does not require any additional code, right?
[07:38:54] <anli_> child of another element that is
[07:39:22] <Eviltwin> What else could it be a child of?
[07:40:09] <dominicbarnes> Howdy all, I have a question about AJAX in jQuery
[07:40:21] <dominicbarnes> it's not a bug or anything like that, more a question of why
[07:40:41] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ dominicbarnes
[07:40:41] <bot-t1> dominicbarnes, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:40:47] <anli_> Eviltwin: null
[07:41:04] <Eviltwin> anli_: Then it wouldn't be an orphan
[07:41:10] <dominicbarnes> Why doesn't the error handler parse the response body (like the success handler does)
[07:41:14] <anli_> It may be newly created
[07:41:27] <Eviltwin> anli_: Then it needs to be adopted to be a child
[07:41:51] <anli_> The question is if I can just html or append it to a parent when its already child of another parent
[07:41:59] <Eviltwin> dominicbarnes: Because some errors don't have a result in the same form as the success
[07:42:10] <Eviltwin> dominicbarnes: Namely the ones like...let's say...parse errors
[07:42:19] <Eviltwin> Where it failed to parse the response body
[07:42:47] <dominicbarnes> true, but I've built a REST API that uses things like 403 to indicate errors, with a body that describes the error
[07:43:12] <Eviltwin> A 403 is an error
[07:44:20] <dominicbarnes> yes, but the body (according to the spec) can be used to describe that error
[07:44:38] <dominicbarnes> and it would be nice if it did the parseJSON before passing off to the handler
[07:45:00] <Eviltwin> dominicbarnes: Okay, and what happens if you send down "{{}"
[07:45:09] <Eviltwin> How should it parse that?
[07:45:27] <dominicbarnes> it would become a parser error at that point
[07:45:42] <dominicbarnes> so, is the question about which error takes priority?
[07:45:44] <Eviltwin> And hit the error handler
[07:45:59] <Eviltwin> So if the error handler expected parsed requests
[07:47:10] <Eviltwin> Long story short: If the status code is an error, you need to parse it yourself and it's right that you should have to parse it yourself
[07:47:24] <Eviltwin> Because it may not be in the format you expected
[07:48:03] <Eviltwin> Like the 500-599 range is likely not in the right format
[07:48:56] <AdvoWork> Im going insane. Any idea why its totally ignoring me trying to set the date? no errors what so ever. http://jsfiddle.net/qHvQe/7/
[07:49:26] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: I know exactly why
[07:49:33] <Lobosque> I have a click handler that triggers a 5 seconds animation. how do I ignore calls to this handler while an animation is happening?
[07:50:04] <joshsmith> I'm trying to prevent an href="#" from doing the default
[07:50:12] <joshsmith> normally I would do e.preventDefault() and return false;
[07:50:24] <joshsmith> but that seems to not be working; is there some other better method of doing that?
[07:50:30] <Eviltwin> Lobosque: Two ways: 1) Use a var as a flag; set it at the beginning of the handler and unset it at the end of the animation
[07:50:40] <Eviltwin> Checking first to see if it's set and if it is, immediately returning
[07:51:00] <Eviltwin> 2) When selecting the thing you want to animate, filter by ":not(:animated)"
[07:51:29] <Eviltwin> So if it's currently animating, it doesn't get selected
[07:51:46] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin,  really?
[07:52:10] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: I'll put it this way: case matters :P
[07:52:44] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, lol :)
[07:52:58] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Try checking the "jQuery Lint" box
[07:53:01] <Eviltwin> And running this again
[07:53:05] <Eviltwin> With the error
[07:53:14] <Eviltwin> You'll get a warning: No elements were found with the selector: "#datePicker"
[07:53:24] <Eviltwin> Super useful runtime debugging info
[07:54:12] <Richard0> Hi guys
[07:54:22] <Richard0> I wonder how I can get a div to fadeIn on submit?
[07:54:29] <Richard0> I use php to submit the form
[07:54:52] <NoiseEee> Richard0: by the time you've hit submit, a new page is being loaded.
[07:55:03] <Eviltwin> Richard0: You use...PHP to submit the form?
[07:55:46] <Richard0> NoiseEee, Eviltwin Yes and Yes
[07:56:48] <freeed> Richard0, the page may reload quicker than the animation, but you could do something like $('.submitbutton').click(function(){ //fade your div })
[07:56:48] <Eviltwin> So $("#myformid").hide().fadeIn() on the receiving page?
[07:57:08] <Eviltwin> Don't entirely understand what you're trying to do
[07:57:20] <Richard0> Alright
[07:57:29] <Richard0> Gonna test your code
[07:58:12] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, ive ticked the jquery lint, ran it, but i see no error(ive put the capital P back in to see it tho)
[07:59:45] <Richard0> Your code didnt fadein the class freeed
[07:59:46] <Richard0> hm
[08:00:26] <bradleymeck> is there a way to have the tabs ui spread across the entire width (akin to width* in a table)
[08:00:30] <freeed> Richard0, well you need to customize it for your needs
[08:00:42] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: You don't see any warnings?
[08:00:49] <Eviltwin> Are you using Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools?
[08:01:41] <sphinxxx> faianca, but apparently .live() is bad compared to .on
[08:01:44] <sphinxxx> :\
[08:01:47] <sphinxxx> who knows
[08:02:08] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: I do!
[08:02:08] <faianca> sphinxxx, yes it is, im sorry, as Eviltwin said it's been deprecated
[08:03:22] <Richard0> freeed: hm, yea
[08:04:33] <LukeNukem> cyber
[08:04:35] <LukeNukem> sholt
[08:06:16] <faianca> sphinxxx,you should do a.className as a selector just fine
[08:07:03] <edulterado> hi there, I´m using event.preventDefault() for using a link to show some divs on clicking, as long as a cookie had a certain value, the thing is that when the cookie changes its value, I need to refresh the page for stop event.preventDefault()
[08:07:09] <edulterado> more precisely: http://pastebin.com/KvNAVp0H
[08:07:41] <edulterado> I guess that using .one() with event.preventDefault() will do the trick
[08:07:54] <edulterado> bu I was wondering if there´s a way of doing the same with the code I have pasted
[08:08:40] <Eviltwin> edulterado: $('*').siblings(".landing-leaf").css('display', 'none');
[08:08:41] <Eviltwin> WTF???
[08:08:54] <Richard0> freeed: I got like this; http://jsfiddle.net/YudAx/
[08:08:55] <edulterado> Eviltwin: yes, that´s a good question
[08:09:36] <Richard0> freeed: http://jsfiddle.net/YudAx/1/ I mean
[08:09:46] <edulterado> Eviltwin: I have known jquery a couple of weeks ago and I have no programming backgrounds at all
[08:09:51] <edulterado> I´m learning :)
[08:11:08] <interopc1p> anybody know why my html file shows a link to a js file which is visible from the browser (click on the link and you can read the source of the js file) but in Chrome, inspect element, I can't see the js file in the scripts drop-down?  Seems like something's wrong.
[08:11:24] <interopc1p> the script isn't working either so I'm worried because it's not visible in the scripts drop-down
[08:11:28] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ edulterado
[08:11:28] <bot-t1> edulterado, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:11:38] <Eviltwin> I highly suggest that you use those resources
[08:12:06] <edulterado> thanks, Eviltwin
[08:12:08] <freeed> Richard0, dont forget to add id="submitbutton" to your submit button
[08:12:28] <Richard0> I do have that if you check http://jsfiddle.net/YudAx/1/
[08:13:45] <freeed> Richard0, no you don't :)
[08:13:54] <freeed> <input type="submit" id="submitbutton" />
[08:14:07] <Richard0> Yea freeed, but check the jquery
[08:14:31] <freeed> Richard0, your button still needs to have an id so jquery can access that element
[08:15:04] <Richard0> freeed: Alright, gonna try that
[08:15:31] <Richard0> Still not fadein
[08:15:31] <Richard0> ;<
[08:16:54] <john____> Richard0: what are you trying to do
[08:16:56] <andrew9183> how would you guys write something that checks if a div has a border style, and if it does, then replace the border style + other style (be it background, etc).  but if it doesn't then just append the border
[08:17:01] <andrew9183> i'm having trouble with the former part
[08:17:16] <Richard0> john____: I'm trying to fadeIn a hidden div when I submit
[08:17:28] <freeed> Richard0, save your revision on jsfiddle and paste us the new link
[08:17:32] <john____> Richard0: http://jsfiddle.net/YudAx/1/  like that?
[08:17:40] <Richard0> Yes
[08:17:57] <john____> it works for me
[08:18:14] <andrew9183> it fades in then disappears for me
[08:18:19] <john____> use the link i pasted
[08:18:30] <freeed> Rochard0, if the page reloads too fast you won't see the animation. You could halt the form submission with jquery, fade your div, then manually submit the form with jquery - this method is frowned upon as users without javascript will be unable to submit the form.
[08:19:41] <mattp_> say ive got a simple loop that creates a dom element
[08:19:44] <freeed> Richard0, or submit your form via ajax - either way the page reload is keeping you from seeing the full animation
[08:19:50] <mattp_> and i need to loop 1000 times
[08:19:55] <mattp_> how can i not block / hang the browser?
[08:20:01] <mattp_> is jquery queue the solution?
[08:20:15] <Eviltwin> Probably not
[08:20:27] <Richard0> freeed: Okay, that I guess I can't do. Don't rly know how. If you got any ideas or links please let me know :)
[08:20:30] <Eviltwin> I don't think that promises to give up any time
[08:20:40] <mattp_> Eviltwin: it just promises to do it in order
[08:20:47] <Eviltwin> But creating 1000 DOM elements isn't particularly slow IMO
[08:20:51] <faianca> Richard0, pass an event  and then event.preventDefault() and u post ur form through Ajax as freeed told you
[08:20:55] <Eviltwin> I mean it's not fast
[08:21:13] <Richard0> faianca: hm
[08:21:14] <mattp_> Eviltwin: well its choking my browser, i just pulled 1000 as an arbitrary number :)
[08:21:25] <faianca> Richard0, http://jsfiddle.net/YudAx/2/
[08:21:55] <mattp_> Eviltwin: do i need to setTimeout each creation?
[08:22:15] <Richard0> faianca: Well yea, but ..
[08:22:16] <Richard0> hm
[08:22:26] <Richard0> I'm using php to post
[08:22:40] <Eviltwin> I'd probably do something like var jobs = []; function dojobs(n) { var job; while(n-- && (job = jobs.shift())) { job(); } if(jobs.length) setTimeout(dojobs, 100, n); } dojobs(10);
[08:22:55] <faianca> Richard0, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:23:03] <Richard0> Thanks
[08:23:09] <Eviltwin> That was for mattp_
[08:23:12] <faianca> Richard0, you will be using PHP to post anyway
[08:23:15] <Eviltwin> Err
[08:23:20] <Richard0> faianca: Alright, sounds good
[08:23:23] <mattp_> Eviltwin: thankyou, ill give that a go
[08:23:28] <Richard0> Thanks for all the help so long guys :)
[08:23:49] <Eviltwin> var jobs = []; function dojobs(n) { var job, i = n; while(i-- && (job = jobs.shift())) { job(); } if(jobs.length) setTimeout(dojobs, 100, n); } dojobs(10);
[08:26:39] <mattp_> Eviltwin: why do you pass n to setTimeout?
[08:27:10] <Eviltwin> mattp_: I guess I don't. I was trying to be flexible in the number of jobs at a time
[08:27:11] <mattp_> 3rd param to setTimeout is 'Optional. The scripting language: JScript | VBScript | JavaScript' evidently
[08:27:16] <Eviltwin> But sicne they're using a shared queue
[08:27:40] <Eviltwin> var jobs = [], n = 10, delay = 100; function dojobs() { var job, i = n; while(i-- && (job = jobs.shift())) { job(); } if(jobs.length) setTimeout(dojobs, delay); } dojobs();
[08:27:58] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps
[08:28:25] <Eviltwin> var jobs = [], n = 10, delay = 100; function dojobs() { var job, i = n; while(i-- && (job = jobs.shift())) { job(); } if(jobs.length) setTimeout(dojobs, delay); else if(typeof callback == "function") callback(); } dojobs();
[08:28:32] <Eviltwin> For something like
[08:29:00] <mattp_> Eviltwin: roger. thanks
[08:29:07] <Eviltwin> function spacedLoop(jobs, delay, n, callback) { function dojobs() { var job, i = n; while(i-- && (job = jobs.shift())) { job(); } if(jobs.length) setTimeout(dojobs, delay); else if(typeof callback == "function") callback(); } dojobs();
[08:29:13] <Eviltwin> }
[08:30:27] <mattp_> Eviltwin: are you familiar with underscorejs? i was just wondering if defer/throttle could achieve the same effect
[08:30:30] <Eviltwin> It'd probably be better to use an iterator model of some kind
[08:30:38] <yan_nick> hey guys, can anybody of you can tell me why i have to click two times on a filter link  ("Foo", "Bar") to get the filtered items? http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/3MG2h/
[08:30:39] <Eviltwin> Haven't really used it, no
[08:31:51] <Eviltwin> 'Cause there's no hash...?
[08:32:14] <Eviltwin> That happens after the click event
[08:35:20] <mattp_> Eviltwin: thanks for the help
[08:36:08] <troubleman> yo yo Eviltwin !
[08:36:14] <troubleman> How's ig going?
[08:36:22] <troubleman> * it
[08:36:56] <uptownben> Hey all
[08:36:59] <uptownben> Got a weird issue
[08:37:36] <muzone> Eviltwin: Any idea how to remove .on-hover from Category A if a link in Category B is clicked at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/22/?
[08:38:37] <uptownben> using Jquery .post to post textfield data to my PHP script, but Jquery keeps inserting a string string into my posted text, looks like this: jQuery7655364758689979_96857346574785
[08:38:51] <Eviltwin> muzone: I think I've done more than enough coding for you
[08:39:30] <muzone> you sure have man.. no doubt about that..
[08:40:05] <andrew9183> it's my turn now, Eviltwin
[08:40:08] <andrew9183> j/k :P
[08:41:04] <Eviltwin> muzone: I think it's time for you to learn how to do this stuff for yourself.
[08:41:14] <uptownben> any ideas?
[08:41:15] <mattp_> Eviltwin: how do you go about shift()ing jquery arrays? it seems not to have shift defined
[08:41:30] <Eviltwin> mattp_: It's not defined/supported
[08:41:38] <mattp_> which i find confusing because i thought the idea of $() was to always return an array :)
[08:41:40] <Eviltwin> You can do .get() on a jQuery object to make it an array
[08:41:47] <Eviltwin> $() doesn't return an array
[08:41:52] <uptownben> JQuery inserting JQuery5756475647586_75647574857 into my submitted text
[08:41:53] <Eviltwin> Arrays don't have .addClass and .removeClass etc.
[08:42:06] <mattp_> ah . got it
[08:42:23] <yan_nick> why i have to click "Foo" two times to filter the items? http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/3MG2h/
[08:42:38] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Pretty sure I already explained this
[08:42:50] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, busy day? lol
[08:42:51] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: you didn't mention me :/
[08:42:58] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Then start scrolling up
[08:43:09] <xckpd7> yan_nick: wow
[08:43:43] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: but after the click event is right
[08:44:52] <muzone> Eviltwin: indeed. ive started reading that book coldhead gave me yesterday :-)
[08:44:53] <Eviltwin> If load the jsFiddle and click "Foo" what do you expect location.hash to be in the .bind('click', function() { ... })
[08:45:16] <mattp_> Eviltwin: works beautifully sir. thank you very much
[08:45:30] <Eviltwin> mattp_: No problem
[08:46:05] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: but the location.hash is set when you click
[08:46:16] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Answer the question
[08:47:38] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: which question?
[08:47:55] <xckpd7> yan_nick: scroll up dude
[08:48:00] <Eviltwin> LEARN2READ
[08:48:08] <xckpd7> he's not even replying to me and I see what he's saying to you
[08:48:35] <Eviltwin> If this is message 5, go up to message 1 of mine
[08:48:38] <yan_nick> xckpd7: If load the jsFiddle and click "Foo" what do you expect location.hash to be in the .bind('click', function() { ... })  isn't a question
[08:48:51] <Eviltwin> No, it is
[08:48:51] <yan_nick> ah
[08:48:55] <Eviltwin> It just doesn't have a "?" at the end
[08:48:56] <yan_nick> the hash is set after the click
[08:49:29] <Eviltwin> 10:31 < Eviltwin> 'Cause there's no hash...?
[08:49:29] <Eviltwin> 10:32 < Eviltwin> That happens after the click event
[08:49:52] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:49:53] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: and how can i fix that nowß
[08:49:56] <xckpd7> lets change the channel name to #daycare
[08:50:00] <yan_nick> should i set the hash manually?
[08:50:02] <sadmicrowave> this is funny to watch unfold
[08:50:25] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: use hash = $(this).attr("href") instead
[08:50:35] <Eviltwin> I'm hoping that since I used your nick, you'll actually see that one
[08:50:52] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: but there is the path included
[08:50:55] <yan_nick> got it yes :D
[08:51:09] <Eviltwin> Then learn regexes
[08:51:19] <Eviltwin> And in your example, there aren't paths included
[08:51:57] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: because i didn't know the path :D
[08:52:08] <freebe> How to create with jQuery?    <li><a href="...">bla</a></li>
[08:52:11] <freebe> var  a = $('<a>').val(url);
[08:52:12] <freebe> var li = $('<li>').text(a);
[08:52:12] <uptownben> anyone seen that? JQuery adding a JQuery857687950_95686758 string to text?
[08:52:12] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: okay i grab all stuff after the #

[08:52:34] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ uptownben
[08:52:34] <bot-t1> uptownben, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:53:54] <xckpd7> freebe: huh?
[08:53:56] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/yannickoo/3MG2h/7/ :)
[08:55:41] <sadmicrowave> freebe, last line should be: var li = $('<li>').html( a );
[08:56:10] <freebe> thanks sadmicrowave
[08:56:17] <sadmicrowave> test before thanking me
[08:56:26] <freebe> :)
[08:56:43] <sadmicrowave> does the smiley indicate a successful test?
[08:58:19] <Richard0> :s
[08:58:49] <fris> anyone have experience with tinymce? im trying to add paragraphs between each generated paragraph http://pastebin.com/euxGpSc2 lines 13,14,15 is how i would do it on a static site, need to adapt to tinymce
[09:03:24] <dv310p3r> What's better or faster, using .ajax() to get an object of data then do some html building in js and then populating the div i want the results in by doing .html(). Or having a php doc already and doing a .load()?
[09:03:44] <dv310p3r> Forget it, stupid question.
[09:04:05] <Eviltwin> Forgotten
[09:07:17] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/22/ (me and Eviltwin's cool new dropdown menu) - how do I remove .on-hover from a link in say Category A if a link in Category B is clicked? And, if a menu link has no dropdown (like NEW), how'd I change it to .on-hover after clicked?
[09:12:17] <sadmicrowave> muzone, $('myselector').unbind('mouseenter mouseleave');
[09:13:12] <sadmicrowave> muzone, by the way, that snippet is on the jquery .hover() docs page, available for all to read
[09:16:45] <muzone> sadmicrowave: cool 2 sec
[09:19:07] <muzone> sadmicrowave: this would go in somewhere under $("#main-menu > li").hoverIntent({?
[09:20:01] <sadmicrowave> not sure, I didn't even open your jsfiddle...I bet you could figure out where you need it to go though...most likely somewhere inside a click event for Category B like your question suggests
[09:21:06] <muzone> sadmicrowave: think you could check it out though?
[09:21:20] <muzone> the code was done by someone with a little bit more experience than me
[09:21:46] <sadmicrowave> by Eviltwin? I'd say 'considerably' more experience lol
[09:22:34] <sadmicrowave> muzone, just try putting that snippet in different places where you 'think' it should go in your code and see what happens....
[09:23:06] <muzone> hehe
[09:23:12] <muzone> okay cool ill give it a shot
[09:23:46] <sadmicrowave> muzone, I'm not trying to be a dick, but if you try and figure it out on your own, it will mean more to you AND you will remember it for next time
[09:23:48] <muzone> sadmicrowave: but i think its a bit more complex than that though
[09:24:18] <troubleman> sadmicrowave: you might as well not talk to the guy imho
[09:24:34] <sadmicrowave> troubleman, I'm starting to feel that way
[09:25:18] <igcewieling> I'm using jquery-ui.  .dialog() only accepts sizes in pixels, not in em.  Is there any way I can calculate the number of pixels height and width for 1em using jQuery (or even JS)?
[09:25:34] * sadmicrowave is taking some Aleve (just 2 for all day relief from your worst pain)
[09:26:05] <VictorCL> how can I take some data and submit it  like if it was a form submit ?
[09:27:29] <sadmicrowave> igcewieling, I believe (based on findings here: http://pxtoem.com/ ) that 16px == 1em ... you can use that for your conversion calculator
[09:27:57] <igcewieling> If I could find the pixel size of a specified selector that would be good as well.
[09:28:31] <igcewieling> sadmicrowave: I thought em's changed size based on your browser zoom level whereas pixels do not.  Is that not correct?
[09:28:43] <quicksilver> ems change pixels depending on the font in use.
[09:28:54] <quicksilver> browser text zoom can indeed change font size.
[09:29:04] <quicksilver> but it's not the only thing that changes font size :)
[09:29:08] <sadmicrowave> igcewieling, that is true
[09:29:13] <igcewieling> ah, sadmicrowave's suggestion won't work then 8-(
[09:29:48] <igcewieling> I prefer to have the page work well with a wide range of zoom levels.
[09:30:14] <sadmicrowave> igcewieling, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5663 its a known bug
[09:31:30] <igcewieling> sadmicrowave: I saw that, which is why I want to convert em to pixels 8-)
[09:31:55] <igcewieling> is there a way to get the current em sizes of a named div or span?
[09:32:11] <igcewieling> I guess that is more of a JS question.
[09:32:29] <sadmicrowave> igcewieling, I don't know of one, you could calculate the percent size though and just use percentages instead of em's
[09:33:17] <sadmicrowave> igcewieling, although I'm not sure how that would work with zoom levels
[09:34:01] <uptownben> I can't really replicate it, it happens occasionally
[09:34:28] <igcewieling> aha!  I should have been looking for .width().
[09:35:01] <uptownben> I've seen values like that before, associated with JQuery.  every once in a while I see JQuery85756375868_95768438 in text that was sent via JQuery.post()
[09:35:21] <uptownben> The value after the underscore is a timestamp
[09:36:01] <muzone> Eviltwin: i'll trade you for this classic Jamaican movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpeHVZl7JXk plus that small donation once I get my paycheck
[09:36:45] <VictorCL> help , I need to send some data as post    .. but $.post send it as ajax .. I need t osend it as if it was a normal form .. with page refresh
[09:37:06] <Eviltwin> muzone: How small of a donation?
[09:37:24] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[09:37:52] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, I wonder how you would be able to ensure he held up his end of the bargain....
[09:37:54] <Eviltwin> I'd probably bill at least $40-100 for the work I've done for you so far :P
[09:38:10] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, you could not help him until he actually gets his paycheck and gives you the donation
[09:38:19] <snagnever> hey! what's the best way to POST a form content using ajax?
[09:38:30] <muzone> Eviltwin: is $50 ok? for now that is. im gonna use this menu to launch my own ecommerce startup in a new exciting niche so hopefully once i get the wheels going ill be able to hook you up with more
[09:38:37] <muzone> sadmicrowave: thanks a lot asshole
[09:38:42] <Eviltwin> snagnever: See ?.ajax and see ?.serialize
[09:38:43] <bot-t1> snagnever, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:38:43] <bot-t1> snagnever, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:39:14] <snagnever> thnaks Eviltwin ;D i know there's a form plugin, but i want to avoid using plugins for simple stuff
[09:39:16] <sadmicrowave> muzone, you'd really rather pay $50 or > instead of just learning the language you are using
[09:39:50] <snagnever> hm Eviltwin i have 500 checkboxes, will that be a problem when using serialize?
[09:39:52] <muzone> sadmicrowave: yeah because i need this menu now and its gonna take a long time to fully master JS
[09:40:28] <NoiseEee> snagnever: you might want to think about whether presenting 500 checkboxes at once is even appropriate, never mind what jquery will do with them!
[09:40:55] <Eviltwin> .serialize will work but, yeah, it sounds like a lot more checkboxes than you should need
[09:41:39] <snagnever> NoiseEee, Eviltwin it's necessary... the default is having all of them selected, you only 'tune' by unchecking some
[09:41:43] <sadmicrowave> VictorCL, it depends how the data is presented....you could insert input tags with your data into the form element and call .submit() on the form
[09:41:55] <Eviltwin> muzone: On your fiddle, can you try to be extemely specific with behavior you want to change? (i.e. what happens if they click one of the Tests vs one of the Categories and what happens when they hover over one that's clicked or not etc)
[09:42:11] <Eviltwin> If you do that and I get a chance later, I'll take a look
[09:42:13] <snagnever> maybe i'll work on tweaking that by only submiting them if they are selected, or considering a NOT-logic :P
[09:42:19] <muzone> marvellous
[09:42:32] <muzone> ill get right on it, see you in a bit
[09:42:47] <Eviltwin> snagnever: If a checkbox isn't set, it serializes to ""
[09:43:12] <Eviltwin> So as long as only a small portion of them are set, it's probably fine
[09:43:38] <snagnever> Eviltwin  i'll test... cause the default behavior is having all 500 selected
[09:43:54] <Eviltwin> snagnever: Why? What's the use case?
[09:44:36] <snagnever> you are ranking investiment funds and you have ~500 'administrators'
[09:44:48] <uptownben> So where would JQuery create a value like that? JQuery678987654352647_9876567890 ?
[09:45:11] <Eviltwin> uptownben: Did you do what I suggested and make a demo of it at jsFiddle.net?
[09:45:21] <VictorCL> well i just created a hidden form .. fill thevalues and submit ti :/ .. sure there is an easier weay
[09:45:30] <uptownben> I responded to that, I cannot replicate it in JSFiddle
[09:45:42] <uptownben> it only happens occasionally
[09:45:51] <uptownben> and I can't narrow it down
[09:46:09] <Eviltwin> :/ might be hard to help then
[09:46:09] <uptownben> trying to figure out why/where JQuery creates an object like that
[09:46:11] <sadmicrowave> VictorCL, thats about it for submitting form data with a regular post
[09:46:13] <Pilate> looks like a jsonp callback function name
[09:46:24] <Eviltwin> uptownben: It does some black magic if you use $.data
[09:46:39] <Eviltwin> Where there might be a unique ID like that
[09:47:30] <shadykhan> yey aced my interview !!!!
[09:48:16] <uptownben> Yeah, I can see that the object being created happens when the .post() is called, and the last set of numbers after the underscore is a timestamp
[09:51:13] <snagnever> is there a shorthand for incrementing? $('#page').val( $('#page').val()+1 );
[09:51:33] <Eviltwin> snagnever: Not exactly because val isn't necessarily a number
[09:51:55] <Eviltwin> You can do var p = $("#page"); p.val(p.val()+1)
[09:52:14] <Eviltwin> Or if you're doing it frequently enough, $.fn.increment = function() { this.val(this.val()+1); };
[09:52:17] <Eviltwin> Then $("#page").increment();
[09:53:39] <snagnever> Eviltwin thanks again!
[09:53:59] <Eviltwin> uptownben: Hang on, this is for params for a $.post?
[09:54:38] <Eviltwin> Where does this first appear and what's the whole string it's a part of?
[09:55:07] <uptownben> yeah
[09:55:37] <Eviltwin> How should the string look and how does it look?
[09:55:39] <Eviltwin> Whole thing
[09:56:23] <muzone> Eviltwin: I hope http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/25/ explains it - other than that the existing behavior is pristine
[09:56:24] <snagnever> how do i determine the 'this' on a function context?
[09:57:13] <Eviltwin> snagnever: Hmm?
[09:57:46] <uptownben> This is directly from the DB: Irish whojQuery17106852350560948253_1326208672316?  the Univeristy of Alabama won its 14th National Football Championship last night!!!  Roll Tide!
[09:58:16] <uptownben> That JQuery string is right in the middle, all it was, was a JQuery.post()
[09:58:16] <Eviltwin> uptownben: Can you use Firebug or the WebKit Developer Tools to see what's actually getting sent?
[09:58:41] <snagnever> i mean, when i use a function as a callback for something, jquery defines WHO is "this" inside that function; i know it's not a jquery-related question, but a js one
[09:59:26] <mike817> if a select field is changed through tabbing/arrow keys the change() event doesn't fire. is there a fix for this?
[09:59:47] <uptownben> Eviltwin: not really, because the code is a simple post, and it seems to only happen intermittently
[09:59:59] <uptownben> I have 500 post, 5 have that string embedded in them
[10:01:10] <uptownben> JQuery bug?
[10:06:08] <NoiseEee> mike817: changes on <select> that way fire after the element loses focus iirc http://jsfiddle.net/L38F4/1/
[10:07:28] <NoiseEee> mike817: think your only solution would to get the value and compare yourself after watching for keyup on the element
[10:07:29] <MrGando> Hey guys, I need some help… I'm tring to add a class to a <p> element, If I inspect the element in the browser, apparently it works, it correctly displays "<p id="paragraph-1" class="big-paragraph">….</p>, but the css style is not applied :(, any ideas ? ( https://gist.github.com/f1c4fcb59e7b1480dac7 )
[10:07:53] <andornaut> So, the official jquery template plugin is no longer maintained? Anyone hear word of a successor?
[10:07:58] <NoiseEee> MrGando: all signs point to bad css definition
[10:08:13] <andornaut> nvm, in jquery.ui now
[10:08:15] <LukeNukem> hello
[10:08:17] <jedimind> andornaut, there is a template thing in .ui now
[10:08:23] <jedimind> or you can go the mustache route
[10:08:27] <MrGando> NoiseEee: big-paragraph { font-weight: bold; }
[10:08:30] <LukeNukem> i cant get php header to work if i use a jquery ui box before it
[10:08:31] <LukeNukem> ;|
[10:08:43] <NoiseEee> MrGando: recreate on jsfiddle
[10:08:49] <andornaut> jedimind: yep, thanks
[10:09:57] <t4nkd> does anyone know of a 'tagging' plugin that enables a user to click(or doubleclick) a tag and edit that text?
[10:10:20] <t4nkd> Just trying to be sure someone didn't already make this...
[10:10:31] <cybersholt> hello all
[10:10:46] <cybersholt> sup LukeNukem
[10:13:45] <Morteza_ipo> hello
[10:13:45] <MrGando> NoiseEee: How can I import twitter bootstrap css on fiddle ? just cut & paste ???
[10:13:51] <Morteza_ipo> I have a question
[10:13:58] <Morteza_ipo> I made a slider with jquery
[10:14:17] <Morteza_ipo> but I have a list of images
[10:14:31] <MrGando> NoiseEee: :( fiddle: 504 Gateway Time-out
[10:14:33] <Morteza_ipo> how to call slider function with delay?
[10:14:50] <MrGando> NoiseEee: Oh seems to work now… let's see
[10:14:55] <NoiseEee> MrGando: the idea is to recreate the fiddle in a simple way; ie: add a new class to a paragraph that properly gets the new css style definition.  if it does (which it likely will), then you focusing on the wrong thing / red herring
[10:15:33] <mike817> NoiseEee: i used bind to attach a change and keyup events to my function. any problem with that?
[10:16:22] <NoiseEee> mike817: try it and see?  to me i'd put both events on the <select>
[10:16:35] <mike817> that's what i did
[10:16:43] <Morteza_ipo> setTimeout("render($('div#mi_img_list img:hidden').first())",1000);
[10:16:43] <mike817> i'm not sure if that's best practice though
[10:16:59] <Morteza_ipo> this code cant work! setTimeout("render($('div#mi_img_list img:hidden').first())",1000);
[10:17:05] <Morteza_ipo> error
[10:17:09] <Morteza_ipo> have error
[10:17:39] <ravenzz> setTimeout(function { foo(bar); }, 1000);
[10:17:46] <ravenzz> ups
[10:17:50] <ravenzz> setTimeout(function() { foo(bar); }, 1000);
[10:19:02] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: Thank you! solved
[10:20:06] <ravenzz> yw
[10:20:08] <MrGando> NoiseEee: I recreated the thing in Fiddle ( I think ) , how can I share it ?
[10:20:31] <NoiseEee> MrGando: "save" and paste the link
[10:20:49] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: how to make time for loading image one by one
[10:21:11] <MrGando> NoiseEee: Weird :(, nothing happens when I press "Save"
[10:21:26] <MrGando> NoiseEee: Ohh there we go, ( no feedback of loading ) http://jsfiddle.net/SBYDx/
[10:21:36] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: I have a div , that have many images  , I made a function , that gives image and make slideshow that
[10:22:06] <Morteza_ipo> but I dont know to call next image! :(
[10:22:41] <ravenzz> $(img1).load(function() { loadNextImage() }); :?
[10:23:47] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: $(img1) ?
[10:24:15] <ravenzz> you want to load the images one by one sequentially?
[10:24:20] <MrGando> NoiseEee: I updated, but still doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/SBYDx/1/
[10:25:14] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: yes
[10:26:16] <NoiseEee> MrGando: the style rule should be '.big-paragraph' not 'big-paragraph', and if you look at the element in any inspector, you'll see that its weigh is getting overriden by the rule ".hero-unit p"
[10:27:49] <MrGando> NoiseEee: Yeah, I just noticed that … is there a way to fix this ? :(
[10:28:26] <NoiseEee> make your rule more specific
[10:28:55] <NoiseEee> instead of '.big-paragraph', make it '.hero-unit p.big-paragraph'
[10:30:13] <MrGando> NoiseEee: I see, that seems to work… that's like an extension to '.hero-unit p'?
[10:30:22] <ravenzz> Morteza_ipo ok hold on
[10:30:51] <NoiseEee> MrGando: its a more specific selector
[10:31:22] <NoiseEee> you're taking everything in the definition for '.hero-unit p' and then further styling <p> elements with the class 'big-paragraph'
[10:34:18] <MrGando> NoiseEee: Thanks for your help mate, I appreciate it :)
[10:34:45] <NoiseEee> np
[10:36:02] <Morteza_ipo> ravenzz: I used queue
[10:39:11] <Sazpaimon> which gets run first $(document).ready() or javascript code that's loaded after the body
[10:43:26] <Matiasu> Hello
[10:43:47] <LukeNukem> is there anyway to make a jquery UI box do redirection
[10:44:37] <Matiasu> I have written two plugins but they only makes sense if you use them with forms in that way: $('myForm').myPlugin(...); is there a way to remove this function from any other element if it's not a form?
[10:45:29] <Matiasu> right now you can do $('#whatever').myPlugin(...) since it's available from any element, I don't want that
[10:45:30] <ravenzz> ?is @ Matiasu
[10:45:31] <bot-t1> Matiasu, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[10:45:33] <kanishka> "media:thumbnail{url:'a'}" if i get a json item how extract the url
[10:46:01] <Matiasu> ravenzz, ok, I mean, I can check if it's a form I would like to remove the plugin from any element other than forms
[10:46:06] <Matiasu> they're two different things
[10:46:26] <Matiasu> form, but I *
[10:46:54] <|PiP|> im using the jQuery Form Validation plugin in my ajax app. I want to attach the validation() method to every form with class validate, even those that are returned from ajax. How can I do this? Can i do this with the .live() method?
[10:47:55] <ravenzz> if ($(this).is('form')) { /* yourcoolpluginbody */ } ?
[10:48:54] <ravenzz> but I haven't code plugins so maybe there is a better solution
[10:49:06] <Matiasu> I'm already doing that (in fact $(this) == this) but it's not the same
[10:49:54] <arthor> is there any way to prevent window jump on a hash change? (without removing the hash change)
[10:50:19] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ arthor
[10:50:19] <bot-t1> arthor, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[10:52:27] <j`ey> hm, I added a mousedown event, but it's messing with things that have onclicks
[10:53:19] <j`ey> is there a way to stop mousedown events on elemtns that have onclick?
[11:01:06] <Zzaichik> j`ey: those two things are very similar… pretty much the same.
[11:01:27] <arthor> j'ey did you try adding return falst to a click event?
[11:01:33] <arthor> *false
[11:01:52] <j`ey> well it doesnt seem like the click event is getting called
[11:02:06] <arthor> is it set with a bind or a .click
[11:02:08] <j`ey> but the mousedown one is
[11:02:11] <j`ey> .click
[11:02:16] <arthor> try a bind
[11:02:24] <Zzaichik> probably need to get a little more specific with what you're targeting
[11:02:47] <Eviltwin> muzone: If they hover the Category A menu and click Test 1, it makes the menu say Test 1 and be highlighter
[11:03:01] <Eviltwin> Now they hover Category B and click Test 2
[11:03:03] <j`ey> Zzaichik: my document has a mousedown, and I have other elements that have onclicks, the onclicks doesnt seem to get called
[11:03:07] <Eviltwin> What happens to the Category A menu?
[11:03:49] <warrenparsons> Holy shit Zoho is terrible.
[11:04:12] <Zzaichik> j`ey: the reason being, they are very similar so the last thing in your js file is what's going to be priority. So you'll have to get more specific in your code.
[11:04:28] <LukeNukem> hello i want to redirect users on dialog box close in jquery
[11:04:32] <LukeNukem> i found this snippe
[11:04:33] <LukeNukem> $('#dialog').live("dialogclose", function(){
[11:04:33] <LukeNukem>    //code to run on dialog close
[11:04:33] <LukeNukem> });
[11:04:36] <LukeNukem> iwas wondering where to put it
[11:04:39] <j`ey> Zzaichik: I see
[11:04:56] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: .live is deprecated, don't use it. Use .on or .delegate instead
[11:05:04] <LukeNukem> example?
[11:05:10] <j`ey> Zzaichik: I just tried changing the order and it didn't work
[11:05:13] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: see ?.on see ?.delegate
[11:05:15] <bot-t1> LukeNukem, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:05:15] <bot-t1> LukeNukem, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:05:38] <LukeNukem> ok so would i put it somewhere inside this ?
[11:05:40] <LukeNukem> <script>jQuery("<div'></div>").attr("id", "divMessage").attr("title", "Success!").addClass("error_message_dialog").html('The category has been created!').dialog({modal:true, resizable: false, height: 500, width: 600});</script>
[11:06:04] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[11:06:07] <Eviltwin> Read the Events tab
[11:06:20] <Eviltwin> All of the things inside there
[11:06:23] <Eviltwin> They expand
[11:06:29] <LukeNukem> cmon man this is fucking confusing
[11:06:34] <Eviltwin> ...
[11:06:41] <Eviltwin> How about this
[11:06:41] <Zzaichik> j`ey: If you're applying a mousedown to the entire document and then an onclick on a few specific elements, you're going to run into problems,
[11:06:51] <Eviltwin> You can start paying me, or you can read the docs
[11:06:56] <Zzaichik> I'm not sure what else to tell you
[11:07:04] <j`ey> Zzaichik: Well, by problems do you mean
[11:07:08] <j`ey> Zzaichik: "it doesn't work"
[11:07:18] <Zzaichik> basically.
[11:07:27] * LukeNukem reads docs :LIKE A BOSS:
[11:07:38] <j`ey> Zzaichik: Ok :P
[11:07:39] <Zzaichik> because you're applying two similar events to one element.
[11:07:48] <Zzaichik> that's going to break
[11:07:49] <j`ey> right
[11:07:57] <j`ey> Ill just have to apply the mousedown to something else
[11:08:09] <Zzaichik> that's a good idea. :)
[11:08:15] <j`ey> should I be using on() or click()
[11:08:54] <Zzaichik> well, depends on what you're doing.
[11:09:26] <warrenparsons> Defaulting to .on() is a good idea.
[11:09:52] <j`ey> reasoning?
[11:09:55] <warrenparsons> Provides consistency, makes refactoring easyer.
[11:09:57] <warrenparsons> er...easier
[11:10:15] <nexus6947> hi, i want to implement a game inventory via jquery. but i am pretty unsure if i shall use drag/dropable, sortable or a mix of both. any ideas or thoughts?
[11:10:22] <j`ey> hm
[11:10:29] <PKKid2> Is there a way to use extend, but not overwrite properties.. ie merge({a:{b:'foo'}}, {a:{c:'bar'}}) results in only the following: {a:{c:'bar'}} when it shuold be {a:{b:'foo', c:'bar'}}
[11:10:31] <Zzaichik> I'd probably go with on('click', function() {…});  But again, I really don't know what you've got going on.
[11:10:48] <j`ey> Zzaichik: but why would it make a difference?
[11:10:54] <j`ey> is there an actual difference in the calls
[11:11:00] <warrenparsons> Seriously, if the extra work in typing .on('click'… vs .click(… is too much for you, there's a bigger problem.
[11:11:15] <NoiseEee> j`ey: yes, its different.
[11:11:20] <Eviltwin> j`ey: .click vs .on in terms of performance?
[11:11:48] <Eviltwin> Almost indistinguishable
[11:11:48] <NoiseEee> j`ey: .on is more flexible, you can remove all listeners with a simple .off call, and its also easier to understand esp. when you're adding more than on listener to an element
[11:11:54] <Eviltwin> While .on is slightly faster
[11:12:04] <kanishka> "y:id" how to search a node of this kind
[11:12:11] <Zzaichik> j`ey: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:12:16] <nexion> is there any case where $.ajax might call the error function with errorThrown = 'timeout' *immediately* as opposed to waiting for 'timeout' seconds? this only happens when a timeout is set
[11:12:18] <Eviltwin> It's not really the kind of optimization that will make/break your site
[11:12:44] <Eviltwin> nexion: Are you setting the timeout in ms?
[11:12:48] <Zzaichik> Eviltwin:  you mean .click() is slightly faster?
[11:13:03] <Eviltwin> Zzaichik: No .click(foo) calls .on("click", foo)
[11:13:06] <Eviltwin> So it can't be faster
[11:13:13] <nexion> Eviltwin, I am not being explicit about it.. it's set to 50
[11:13:14] <Eviltwin> But the only additional cost is the function call
[11:13:33] <Eviltwin> nexion: Then that means it has 1/20th of a second before it times out
[11:14:25] <Eviltwin> nexion: Probably not what you want
[11:14:39] <nexion> hm.. you are correct.. somehow I convinced myself that value was in seconds
[11:14:41] <nexion> thanks :)
[11:14:50] <Promethes> hi, anyone knows when http://plugins.jquery.com will be back online?
[11:14:52] <Eviltwin> I wasn't sure but it's pretty clear on the docs
[11:14:56] <Eviltwin> nexion: see ?.ajax
[11:14:57] <bot-t1> nexion, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:17:04] <muzone> Eviltwin: greetings, sorry was away
[11:17:19] <|PiP|> ravenzz: but will that attach to items that are returned after document.ready has been called? ie ajax requests?
[11:17:43] <muzone> Eviltwin: in that case - Category A returns to normal, i.e. no highlighting
[11:18:14] <Eviltwin> So only one is set like this at a time?
[11:18:15] <muzone> Test 1 disappears and it should say Category A
[11:18:17] <kanishka> any one help me with this json {media:is{url:a}} how to get it ... (media:is.url) ??
[11:18:24] <muzone> yes indeed
[11:18:29] <muzone> just one
[11:18:31] <Eviltwin> And they can make it zero by clicking Category in the one that's selected?
[11:18:37] <Eviltwin> Or not
[11:19:43] <pensfan> what's the best way to have a simple function to ajax requst something that returns json?
[11:19:51] <muzone> if Test 1 from Category A is already selected, and the user hovers Test 1 so it says Category A, and the user then clicks, then it should say Category A (and be hilighted)
[11:19:58] <Eviltwin> pensfan: see ?.getJSON
[11:19:59] <bot-t1> pensfan, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[11:20:05] <pensfan> ty
[11:20:13] <Eviltwin> muzone: Oh, and be highlighted?
[11:20:18] <muzone> hopefully this should make it usable..
[11:20:19] <Eviltwin> So they can't unset?
[11:20:37] <muzone> no, unless they click on another link
[11:20:44] <j`ey> Eviltwin: well if click calls on, Ill use click.
[11:20:47] <Eviltwin> But then it sets the other one
[11:20:52] <Eviltwin> So it starts out with nothing set
[11:20:57] <j`ey> thanks
[11:20:57] <Eviltwin> Then once they click, they can't get bacm to nothing set
[11:20:59] <Eviltwin> Correct?
[11:21:19] <muzone> well yes
[11:21:31] <Eviltwin> Just trying to be clear about what you want
[11:21:34] <muzone> although, on the actual site, it should reset if the user returns to the front page
[11:21:36] <Eviltwin> (These were the kind of details I wanted before)
[11:22:14] <muzone> cool yeah
[11:22:40] <Mkop> anyone know if there's a way to get rid of the close button in the top right corner of a jquery ui dialog?
[11:26:11] <Eviltwin> muzone: Alright, don't have time to do this right now but those details will help if I have time this evening
[11:26:23] <Eviltwin> I have some work work to do now
[11:26:36] <nexus6947> no one can give me an advice?
[11:26:41] <cwillu_at_work> stupid trick of the day:  foo:hover {background: red; pointer-events: none;}
[11:27:04] <Eviltwin> nexion: I missed your question
[11:27:15] <nexus6947> i want to implement a game inventory via jquery. but i am pretty unsure if i shall use drag/dropable, sortable or a mix of both. any ideas or thoughts?
[11:27:41] <j`ey> yes both
[11:29:09] <muzone> Eviltwin: sure thing man!
[11:30:57] <Eviltwin> cwillu_at_work: This is pretty good for just CSS: http://doodletops.tumblr.com/
[11:32:45] <nicholasschulz> Is there a similar function as the PHP explode in JS ?
[11:32:56] <anchovy> nicholasschulz, .split()
[11:33:02] <nicholasschulz> thanks :-)
[11:34:16] <LekeFly> Anyone here used http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html in a vertical setup.. im trying to get the "easing" animation to work.. but seems it doesnt work on vertical
[11:35:22] <gho5t> is doing: $('#foo').each() an alternative way of doing if($('#foo').length > 0) {
[11:35:43] <friedbyte> how would I set a variable to the get id of an clicked element?
[11:35:49] <nicholasschulz> I am creating a validation function that works in the principle like this (haven't coded it yet): User types in text in the given textfields -> Hits "OK" -> The information is submitted to "validate.php" through AJAX -> AJAX returns a string of 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 of all fields are Ok, otherwise it will return a string containing zeroes where the fields are not valid. Does this sound Ok ?
[11:36:14] <Eviltwin> gho5t: No...
[11:36:30] <Eviltwin> friedbyte: this.id or $(this).attr("id")
[11:36:49] <gho5t> Eviltwin: I see people doing that all the time when the item they're selecting clearly is only singular. why?
[11:38:10] <Eviltwin> gho5t: In case it's not singular?
[11:38:19] <gho5t> an id?
[11:38:22] <Eviltwin> If it's definitely singular, then sure
[11:38:29] <Eviltwin> I assumed you use #foo as a generic selector
[11:38:34] <gho5t> sorry yes
[11:38:39] <friedbyte> Thanks Eviltwin, I'll try that . . .
[11:38:49] <Eviltwin> It also has the benefit of creating the new scope
[11:38:57] <Eviltwin> Because of the function
[11:38:57] <gho5t> so if it's definitely singular, you can check with $('#foo').each
[11:39:09] <Eviltwin> If your goal is to check if it exists, don't use .each
[11:39:21] <Eviltwin> If your goal is to do something if it exists that might require a new scope
[11:39:24] <Eviltwin> Then use .each
[11:41:27] <gho5t> ok
[11:45:53] <someprimetime> say i'm making a plugin, and I want to be able to just add a specific id (e.g. #foobar) to a div and then within my js code, use that specific id to do a bunch of stuff within that container (e.g. $find() and whatnot), what's the best way to handle that id from being added to multiple divs on a page? obviously i'd run into conflicts if i have > 1 unique id selector on an element, but the way this plugin works, we could end up
[11:45:54] <someprimetime> using it more than once on a single page
[11:46:19] <Eviltwin> How about...not use an ID?
[11:46:45] <nicholasschulz> I want to make a validation on my form… Once the user has changed the standard value of the textfield it should check of its ok or not… Any suggestions on how to do this?
[11:47:02] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: see ?g jquery validate
[11:47:03] <bot-t1> nicholasschulz, bassistance.de  jQuery plugin: Validation - http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[11:47:16] <jedimind> nicholasschulz, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+form+validation
[11:47:17] <someprimetime> actually, i guess i could just use a class, and use $(this) to reference the current container, right?
[11:47:34] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Why not just use $(this) to reference the current container
[11:47:52] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, good call
[11:48:05] <kreantos> asteve
[11:48:13] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Do I make any other kind?
[11:48:16] <kreantos> *sry
[11:48:21] <NoiseEee> crank
[11:48:44] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: wake up calls would be nice. i'm currently using wakerupper for that though
[11:54:27] <Mkop> I am trying to make a div flash. Can anyone recommend a better approach than this: http://jsfiddle.net/8BeZD/
[11:54:56] <nexus6947> is it possible with the ui-sortable to switch 2 items directly? and not just change the position in the list?
[11:54:57] <Mkop> rather, I am trying to make a whole bunch of divs flash. in this example there is obvioiusly only one div
[11:59:37] <nicholasschulz> There has got to be a simpler way to validate a form using JS? Every method Im reading about has this HUGE .js that seems unnecessary to me.
[12:07:38] <Eviltwin> Mkop: Does it flash forever?
[12:07:45] <daslicht> how do you use server side things with jquery ? json-rpc ?
[12:08:02] <Eviltwin> daslicht: ?
[12:08:20] <Mkop> Eviltwin: yes, until the user acknowledges and I remove the flashing and flashing2 classes
[12:08:47] <Mkop> I realize I can replace the first four lines of the function with $(".flashing,.flashing2").toggleClass("flashing flashing2");
[12:09:15] <Eviltwin> If you add the color plugin, you can do animation with colors
[12:09:17] <Mkop> but the flashing is uneven. not sure why - I figured that would be solved when I switched from setInterval to setTimeout
[12:09:18] <Eviltwin> Probably prettier
[12:09:43] <Mkop> in my real app I use a background-color that makes sense contextually
[12:10:04] <Mkop> animation/prettier = fading rather than simply alternating?
[12:10:05] <Eviltwin> But do you really want that sharp color change like that?
[12:10:14] <Eviltwin> Yes...that's exactly what I mean
[12:10:31] <Mkop> the point is to catch people's attention
[12:10:35] <Mkop> this isn't for normal site visitors
[12:10:45] <Eviltwin> It's still not pretty :P
[12:10:51] <Mkop> this is a dashboard to display critical lab values to nurses in the ICU
[12:10:54] <Eviltwin> Makes it hard to read if it's more than a few words
[12:11:04] <Mkop> I will give animation a try.
[12:11:16] <Mkop> the background-color I use is kinda pinkish, doesn't prevent readability
[12:11:25] <Eviltwin> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[12:11:35] <Mkop> #FFAFAF if you're interested
[12:11:51] <JJMalina> how can I remove the first item from an array of jQuery objects
[12:12:09] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: You can make a new one that doesn't have the first one using .slice(1)
[12:12:19] <Eviltwin> Which is the same as .gt(0)
[12:12:34] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: thanks, I thought I could use .shift() but that didnt work
[12:13:00] <Eviltwin> Sorry, it's the same as the :gt(0) selector but there's no filter for that because you can just use .slice(1)
[12:13:18] <Mkop> "This plugin is based on Color Animations by John Resig. It fixes a major bug and also adds support for the borderColor-property." out of curiosity, is there a reason they forked rather than resig just fixing the bug in his released version?
[12:13:28] <Eviltwin> No idea
[12:13:37] <Eviltwin> Never actually used it directly
[12:16:59] <kanishka> http://jsfiddle.net/kanishkablack/sM7W7/4/  can anyone help with the y:title ? plz
[12:17:25] <Eviltwin> With...what?
[12:17:47] <kanishka> how to use that y:title in extracting data
[12:18:00] <ronskee_weboolu> hi, quick question, is anyone familiar with the engine that's running the api documentation for api.jquery.com?
[12:18:16] <Eviltwin> The "y:title"?
[12:18:18] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[12:18:36] <kanishka> http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=802859b677f5a2ae70d29b5307993920&_render=json
[12:19:00] <Eviltwin> Oh, see ?object
[12:19:01] <bot-t1> Oh, object.foo === object["foo"]
[12:19:03] <kanishka> output shows the y:title as a node i am nable to get into the node
[12:19:31] <Eviltwin> Does that help?
[12:19:42] <kanishka> no i tested it
[12:19:52] <Eviltwin> What did you test?
[12:20:01] <kanishka> console.log(item.y:title);
[12:20:05] <Mkop> no. the fade-in definitely looks wrong
[12:20:10] <Eviltwin> kanishka: see ?object
[12:20:10] <bot-t1> kanishka, object.foo === object["foo"]
[12:20:21] <Eviltwin> It's telling you an alternate syntax
[12:20:24] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to use the key syntax
[12:20:27] <Eviltwin> That might be more useful
[12:20:33] <Eviltwin> In the right situation
[12:20:36] <Eviltwin> Like this situation
[12:20:36] <Mkop> the goal (of making the flash effect less pronounced) is against what I what
[12:20:47] <aaronmcadam> y:title will probably fire an unknown symbol exception
[12:20:55] <kanishka> console.log(item.y['title']) even i tested it
[12:21:07] <Eviltwin> Mkop: Totally up to you, just wanted to make sure you knew it was an option
[12:21:12] <Mkop> I appreciate that
[12:21:13] <Eviltwin> kanishka: You're really not getting this
[12:21:16] <Eviltwin> item["y:title"]
[12:21:30] <Mkop> it was definitely worth a try
[12:21:32] <kanishka> yeah
[12:21:42] <kanishka> Eviltwin: that worked
[12:22:00] * Eviltwin is shocked
[12:22:01] <Eviltwin> :P
[12:22:05] <kanishka> i am a beginner in javasceipt
[12:22:11] <kanishka> script
[12:22:31] <Mkop> the issue of the flashing being uneven (seems like sometimes it forgets to fire when scheduled) is still relevant
[12:24:44] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: question, does slice() return a new array or destructively alter the one its called on?
[12:25:06] <Eviltwin> JJMalina: New, that's what I was trying to clarify earlier
[12:25:14] <Eviltwin> (But obviously didn't do a good job)
[12:25:32] <JJMalina> Eviltwin: no you did mention that but I didnt pay attention. explains this bug :)
[12:28:36] <aaronmcadam> on node, it returns a new array
[12:29:08] <Mkop> so I recorded the time gap in ms between calls to flash(), and it is usually right around 503, but sometimes randomly pspikes to 700 or 1000
[12:29:16] <Mkop> maybe setInterval is the better way
[12:29:34] <aaronmcadam> Mkop what ya doin dude?
[12:29:41] <aaronmcadam> animations?
[12:29:45] <Mkop> trying to figure out why my flashing div isn't flashing evenly
[12:29:55] <aaronmcadam> could try using the queue api?
[12:30:34] <Eviltwin> Mkop: Is it happening in the fiddle?
[12:30:45] <Mkop> http://jsfiddle.net/8BeZD/3/ is a stripped down version of what I'm doing
[12:31:21] <Eviltwin> And is that having the spikes?
[12:31:52] <Mkop> yes, fiddle also has spikes
[12:32:03] <Eviltwin> What browser / hardware?
[12:32:05] <Mkop> let me try with setInterval
[12:32:08] <Mkop> crappy hardware
[12:32:10] <Mkop> FF9
[12:32:35] <odeland> before I try, did anyone try using $.get with jquery ui .dialog? Is my computer going to explode if I do that?
[12:33:44] <aaronmcadam> Mkop yeah looks ok http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/8BeZD/7/
[12:34:18] <Mkop> with setInterval I get spikes low and high
[12:34:22] <Mkop> (which makes sense)
[12:34:33] <aaronmcadam> ?queue
[12:34:33] <Mkop> question is, which is better for UI?
[12:34:33] <bot-t1> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[12:35:33] <Mkop> is .queue relevant since I'm not using animate functions?
[12:35:43] <aaronmcadam> oh, yeah
[12:35:49] <aaronmcadam> *maybe* not
[12:36:57] <Mkop> maybe this problem only exists on my computer with my overworked graphics cards
[12:37:20] <Mkop> my graphics cards have been acting retarded lately. taking 10 seconds to minimize a window, that kind of thing
[12:37:26] <aaronmcadam> weird
[12:37:29] <Mkop> I have a 3-monitor setup with crappy video cards
[12:37:33] <aaronmcadam> what platform u on?
[12:37:36] <Mkop> winxp
[12:37:39] <aaronmcadam> right
[12:37:51] <aaronmcadam> I want another monitor :( heh
[12:37:58] <Mkop> 3 monitors is nice
[12:38:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah 2's not enough
[12:38:18] <Mkop> right now I have one for FF, one for xchat, one for excel and eclipse
[12:38:27] <aaronmcadam> excel?
[12:38:37] <Mkop> I was plotting to see the spikes
[12:38:42] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[12:39:02] <aaronmcadam> hmm I wouldn't be tempted to blame graphics cards
[12:39:33] <Mkop> my third monitor is rotated 90 degrees. I often use it for FF+firebug which is nice with the extra height
[12:40:11] <Mkop> what the heck, I'll just leave this problem for now. it is only a slight annoyance and I have bigger things to fix in my code :-)
[12:40:54] <aaronmcadam> yeh it's easy to get bogged down
[12:41:20] <aaronmcadam> given perf you'd have to check the overhead of adding a class over adding a style attr
[12:41:57] <aaronmcadam> I'd guess mutating the style attr would be faster on a benchmark, only supposing tho
[12:43:21] <Eviltwin> Also, if there's another page in your browser that's being slow, that can affect the othe rpages
[12:43:25] <Eviltwin> other*
[12:43:29] <Eviltwin> I would try closing all other windows/tabs
[12:43:36] <Eviltwin> See if it still happens
[12:43:54] <Mkop> yeah. my deployment target will probably have this open and nothing else
[12:44:32] <Mkop> you're probably right that closing other windows/tabs would fix it, but I'm not about to restart my entire everything (I have 12 windows and ~12 tabs open right now) just to test  :-)
[12:54:30] <steve_web_cloud> can anyone confirm the following for me (one way or the other).... I'm using jquery 1.7.0 to .clone() a div... then on the cloned div... change via .attr() the id and name attributes to new values... in all browsers it works fine (including IE8) but fails to change the ids/names in IE7.... is this a known (but not documented) issue with jQuery and IE7... or is this solvable
[12:55:56] <Eviltwin> steve_web_cloud: Doesn't sound like a known issue to me
[12:56:06] <Eviltwin> But I would be surprised if it's actually a bug
[12:56:27] <NoiseEee> steve_web_cloud: how do you know nothing was changed in ie7?
[12:56:30] <Eviltwin> Perhaps make a jsFiddle example?
[12:57:10] <Sonderblade> is it possible in an ajax call, to get what the original referer to a page was?
[12:57:39] <|PiP|> the jquery validation plugin lets u attach validation to a form like such: $('#myform').validate().. i want to attach a validation to all my forms (current, and future ones that are returned by ajax that have a class ='validate'). so basically, i want to run $('form.validate').validate() on all current and future elements. how can i do that?
[12:58:42] <dbruns> How can I add a key value pair to the query string when doing $.getScript(self.href) ?
[12:58:44] <Mkop> Sonderblade: pass document.referrer as a parameter
[12:58:52] <steve_web_cloud> @NoiseEee... not sure... I know that in IE8 MSFT fixed a pile of issues with setAttribute().... if jQuery under the covers always uses this, and doesnt apply hacks for IE7... then it will fail...
[12:59:15] <cybersholt> anybody got a sec, trying to make a drag n drop work and getting some weird behavior http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/wxvCL/
[12:59:17] <NoiseEee> steve_web_cloud: of course jquery deals with those probems
[12:59:21] <Mkop> jQuery is almost always backwards compatible with IE6+
[12:59:30] <steve_web_cloud> I was under the impression that jQuery has a "set" of known issue attributes that IE had issues with and always applied the hacks if needed.
[12:59:41] <dbruns> Also, when adding an event handler such as  $('input:radio').live('click', function () . . .  etc   how can I access the value of the clicked radio button?
[13:00:03] <NoiseEee> dbruns: this.val()
[13:00:39] <Eviltwin> dbruns: Don't use .live
[13:00:43] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[13:00:51] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on if you're using 1.7+
[13:00:55] <dbruns> ok.
[13:00:58] <dbruns> i was on 1.4
[13:01:03] <dbruns> but i upgraded to 1.7 today
[13:01:15] <steve_web_cloud> @NoiseEee... true, although I recall there are somecases (at least in the past) that jQuery missed them... e.g. I recall appending options to an optgroup via .html() (or something very similar failed...
[13:01:29] <Eviltwin> Read http://api.jquery.com/delegate and/or http://api.jquery.com/on
[13:01:42] <steve_web_cloud> I'll try and make a simplified test case on jsfiddle... see if I can duplicate the issue...
[13:02:07] <NoiseEee> steve_web_cloud: indeed.  and use JS to give you the "new" ids and name; don't depend on whatever debugger you're using for IE7
[13:02:32] <steve_web_cloud> yeah, the debugger for IE7 is sh*te
[13:02:42] <cybersholt> hey evil u got a sec ? im trying to make a drag n drop here http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/wxvCL/ and having problems removing the obj the 1st time
[13:03:01] <Mkop> IE7 has a debugger?
[13:03:12] <steve_web_cloud> a downloadable one...
[13:03:16] <Mkop> I debug by typing "javascript:alert(some_value)" in the address bar
[13:03:33] <CantUnplug> http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite  works in IE
[13:03:34] <steve_web_cloud> just as sucky as the IE8 one, but didn't update the HTML well at all
[13:03:46] <Mkop> holy crap
[13:03:57] <Mkop> you mean that pain debugging IE7 was (in a sense) self-inflicted?
[13:04:02] <cybersholt> lol was about to say that too
[13:06:40] <eirikb> Hello. Is .bind suppose to be similar to addEventListener? I'm trying a simple bind('touchstart'... but the for addEventListener the event is triggered instantly, while with bind it is triggered on release
[13:07:22] <Eviltwin> It calls addEventListener
[13:07:34] <Mkop> LOL - http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite gives a JS error in IE7
[13:09:32] <eirikb> Eviltwin: It's here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L864 ?
[13:10:19] <eirikb> And then under jQuery.event.add on line 115?
[13:11:48] <eirikb> Eviltwin: Anyway, it does not seem to work as expected. If you have a touch device I can create a non-jsfiddle demo for you
[13:12:36] <Kzim> hi this must check all radio button with rel="1" no ?
[13:12:37] <Mkop> anyone want to express an opinion on storing a global options object via window.options=data vs $("body").data('options',data)?
[13:13:31] <Eviltwin> eirikb: Why can't you make a jsFiddle demo?
[13:14:05] <eirikb> Eviltwin: Just guessed it would not work appropriate for a device with higher probability of smaller screen. But yeah can sure do that
[13:14:32] <Eviltwin> eirikb: Also: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L118
[13:14:45] <Eviltwin> eirikb: If you add /show/ to the end of the URL, it's just the Result frame
[13:15:10] <eirikb> Eviltwin: That is parts of the lines I mentioned, yes
[13:15:21] <eirikb> Eviltwin: I did not know about the /show-part, thanks
[13:16:02] <Eviltwin> eirikb: You can highlight sections like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L1-1024
[13:16:13] <fpanahi> Hello In jquery java replace function only replaces the first occurrence even though the documentation says it should replace all the occurrences. Am I missing something?
[13:16:14] <NoiseEee> funny question... how to get at natural JS properties like "offsetTop" from $('p') ?
[13:16:31] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: see ?.prop
[13:16:31] <bot-t1> NoiseEee, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[13:16:42] <NoiseEee> thanks Eviltwin
[13:17:00] <nicholasschulz> I have a div called "loadBuy" that should contain the content of buy.html .. I use this to load it : $("#loadBuy").load('buy.html'); Why doesnt it show?
[13:17:00] <Eviltwin> But I'm pretty sure there's a .offsetTop() helper for that
[13:28:31] <Krinkle> nicholasschulz: still there ?
[13:28:57] <nicholasschulz> yes
[13:29:10] <Krinkle> nicholasschulz: Can you paste your code somewhere for us to see ?
[13:29:13] <nicholasschulz> i got it figured out :-) thanks
[13:29:19] <Krinkle> nicholasschulz: document ready ?
[13:29:42] <Krinkle> how did you fix it ?
[13:29:59] <nicholasschulz> i had erased the .js file by a mistake… so everything stopped working ;-)
[13:30:01] <elb0w> Im trying to get datepicker to work with simplemodal
[13:30:06] <elb0w> so far I want to shoot myself in the face
[13:30:15] <elb0w> I attached it to fire to bind to the right #id when the modal pops
[13:30:21] <elb0w> but now when I pick the value it doesnt populate it
[13:30:38] <elb0w> any idea?
[13:31:11] <MoTiOnXml> why the hell is console.log() throwing exceptions in IE when the dev-console is not open?
[13:31:13] <MoTiOnXml> WTF?
[13:31:21] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, seriously?
[13:31:30] <Mkop> MoTiOnXml: old IE doesn't have a console
[13:31:31] <Eviltwin> MoTiOnXml: Most browsers don't have a native window.console
[13:31:35] <NoiseEee> come on, you know you want to hug IE
[13:31:40] <MoTiOnXml> Mkop: I'm in IE9 rendering mode
[13:31:50] <MoTiOnXml> it works when i've got the F12 dev tools open
[13:33:30] <z0n3d> i'm trying to make an ajax request to a db located on my testing server. i keep getting this in my console: Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:33:44] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ elb0w
[13:33:45] <bot-t1> elb0w, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[13:33:56] <LordThumper> Is Event Delegation the only to use Events in Javascript (i.e. Can I use events without binding them to an element?)
[13:34:05] <Krinkle> z0n3d: yep, XmlHttpRequests are not allowed cross-domain, for security reasons
[13:34:07] <LordThumper> way to use*
[13:34:15] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Since you own both domains you can do this however
[13:34:37] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Add support to your entry-point at localhost for a callback (i.e. JSONP instead of standard JSON)
[13:34:53] <z0n3d> $.getJSONP ?
[13:34:53] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Is it a php script ?
[13:34:54] <Mkop> probably easier to just do it non-cross-domain
[13:34:57] <Krinkle> z0n3d: No
[13:35:01] <z0n3d> Krinkle, lol.
[13:35:02] <z0n3d> and yes
[13:35:23] <z0n3d> Mkop, i really don't want to have to clone all my databases to localhost
[13:35:58] <Mkop> oh, ok. so use jsonp
[13:36:10] <Mkop> (I don't know how. I need to learn one of these days0
[13:36:13] <CantUnplug> zOn3d - you can do a json to a local which does server side curl..
[13:36:24] <CantUnplug> adds about .0001 sec to roundtrip
[13:36:28] <Krinkle> z0n3d: OK. So if ! (not) isset $_GET['callback']: content-type: text/javascript; and echo json_encode($stuff); (which you have already)
[13:36:46] <z0n3d> right...
[13:37:29] <z0n3d> content-type: application/json is what i'm using actually, then json_encoding
[13:37:52] <pur3forlyphe> can you use .hover inside a javascript if statement, i.e. if ($(".foo").hover){ do something } ?
[13:38:03] <Eviltwin> pur3forlyphe: No
[13:38:13] <z0n3d> pur3forlyphe, why would you need to do that?
[13:38:16] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").hover will always evaluate to true
[13:38:27] <Krinkle> z0n3d: else (if callback and ctype_alpha($_GET['callback']): content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8; and  $_GET['callback'] ( json_encode() )
[13:38:36] <interopc1p> anybody know where you set firefox's font that ir uses for forms (like drop-down boxes etc.)?
[13:38:40] <pur3forlyphe> to stom an animation if the element is hovered on
[13:38:42] <SinnerNyx> trying to debug jquery plugin i'm making. some events appear to not be firing. I was wondering if there is some tool that will list out all events fired?
[13:38:42] <eirikb> Eviltwin: It seems it was because I was calling e.changedTouches[0].pageX, for bind it would not call out but for addEventListener it would. I'm currently not able to recreate it because both ongoingTouches and currentTouches are undefined (not in originalEvent though). Maybe just using e.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX is the best solution anyway
[13:38:49] <Krinkle> so json_encode with text/javascript for normal JSON, and for JSONP give application/json with callback(json_encode)
[13:39:11] <z0n3d> pur3forlyphe, ... $("#foo").hover(function() { $("#anime").stop(); });
[13:39:22] <pur3forlyphe> ok nice one ty
[13:39:33] <danzik17> pur3forlyphe: you can use $( el ).is( ":hover"), or ?mouseover would probably work better.
[13:39:51] <z0n3d> just put the stop inside the hover function... that's what it's for. why would you need an if
[13:40:13] <tjd> hi, i have a <select> element, and I want to prevent the browser from drawing the dropdown menu when it is clicked, but not by making it appear disabled...is that doable with jquery?
[13:40:16] <pur3forlyphe> thats trye
[13:40:53] <tjd> more specificallyl, i want to delay the drawing of the <select>'s dropdown until after an animation is complete
[13:41:01] <z0n3d> Krinkle, i'm already using application/json, and echo'ing the json_encode. how do i send/call/define/whatever i have to do with a callback? confused.
[13:41:30] <MoTiOnXml> UI.position is just a killer utility
[13:41:41] <MoTiOnXml> just replaced lots of code
[13:41:46] <MoTiOnXml> thanks, whoever wrote it :)
[13:41:47] <Krinkle> z0n3d: http://pastebin.com/RUFxR9JW
[13:42:49] <z0n3d> Krinkle, do i need to define a callback function in my JS?
[13:43:08] <pur3forlyphe> the reason i wanted the if is so i could invert the hover i.e. if the element is not being hovered on, carry on the animation
[13:43:35] <z0n3d> or just specifying the &callback= parameter will tell it to be treated as JSONP instead of JSON? how does this work
[13:43:37] <Krinkle> z0n3d: if you use $.getJSON, then jquery will detect that it is cross-domain and attempt JSONP, so it gives a [?&]callback= and creates a global function with that name and reroutes it to the callback you pass to getJSON
[13:43:50] <z0n3d> genius
[13:43:52] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Okay, so very short about what JSONP is
[13:45:35] <Krinkle> JSONP is actually not really JSON, not all. It's not even AJAX. What you do is create a dynamic .js file that calls a function named whatever you put in $callback=. So in your main application there needs to be a function by that name. so if you do window.foo = function( data ) { console.log('json return from server', data); }; and then <script src="api_with_jsonp_support.php?calback=foo"> <!-- will echo "foo({ data: 'here' });"
[13:45:39] <Krinkle> z0n3d: ^
[13:46:06] <Krinkle> jQuery creates that function for you (a randomized name) and adds &callback= and then removes the function after it is done.
[13:46:11] <z0n3d> Krinkle, but jquery does it for you?
[13:46:15] <z0n3d> awesome
[13:46:26] <Krinkle> so it's almost as if it were AJAX :)
[13:46:34] <z0n3d> thank you for the info :)
[13:46:48] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: JSONP is JSON with padding :P
[13:47:04] <LordThumper> I need to use custom Events, that are not tied to any elements specifically. What should I do? Just create a dummy element and bind/trigger events from it?
[13:48:11] <LordThumper> Not sure if the terminology is right...
[13:48:18] <Eviltwin> Can you give an example?
[13:49:12] <Krinkle> Eviltwin: jep, but the resulting content is not a valid JSON string and is not parsed as JSON, it's executed as script.
[13:49:52] <Eviltwin> Krinkle: In fact it's never a valid JSON string
[13:50:06] <Krinkle> it is essentially almost as bad as global eval.. so the api server does have power, but than again, anything you do cross-domain (even ads) is essentially self-inflicted XSS.
[13:50:19] <z0n3d> Krinkle, why would i use text/javascript if not using a callback? i've been using application/json for everything
[13:50:32] <cybersholt> anybody know how to arrange images in a circle ??? i have a div + drag n drop images
[13:50:37] <z0n3d> (not literally everything, but for anything that echos json_encode)
[13:51:01] <MoTiOnXml> is it possible to use ui.position using the pointer/event as reference?
[13:51:03] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Only if using a callback use text/javascript, otherwise it's application/json
[13:51:09] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Sorry if I mixed up
[13:51:26] <LordThumper> Yes. I am developing two different User Controls in ASP.Net. Each has its own Javascript which I want to interact together to some extent. However I want the controls to still be independent, so I don't think calling functions from one control to another is good design.
[13:51:28] <z0n3d> ah, ok, that makes sens.
[13:51:29] <z0n3d> e
[13:51:57] <LordThumper> For example I want one control to fire a "User has changed page styling" event. The other module listens to this event, and reacts when it is fired.
[13:52:27] <LordThumper> I hope that makes sense..
[13:52:58] <coppa> http://jquery-css.com/download/mobile/ I am currently preparing an automatic ajax navigation
[13:53:27] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: What do you think?
[13:53:32] <coppa> the link will be a downloadable basic website for mobile
[13:54:11] <coppa> Something really simple to have automatic ajax navigation is missing I think thus I am tring to do so

[13:56:36] <Mehrdad> how do u call a parent object's function?
[13:56:49] <Eviltwin> Explain further
[13:56:56] <Eviltwin> What you mean
[13:57:11] <LordThumper> Thanks Eviltwin. I don't know if it makes sense doing this with events. With Asp.net c# I create an event on a page, then subscribe to that event from another page to communicate cleanly between two pages
[13:57:24] <Mehrdad> anyone/
[13:57:31] <Eviltwin> Mehrdad: Explain further what you mean
[13:57:34] <Mehrdad> how do u call a parent object's function?
[13:57:43] <Eviltwin> Mehrdad: Explain further what you mean
[13:58:01] <Eviltwin> Nice
[13:58:11] <JD-Robbs> Off-topic, I know, but to anyone who ever used GoDaddy: I suppose the strikethrough prices apply from the second year onwards? I don't understand the small-print :D
[13:58:11] <Eviltwin> Mehrdad: Explain further what you mean
[13:58:32] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: Friends of mine have had nothing but bad experiences with GoDaddy
[13:58:51] <chovy> JD-Robbs: go with netfirms. you get free privacy.
[13:59:01] <Eviltwin> I use DreamHost personally
[13:59:05] <Eviltwin> And have been very satisfied
[13:59:18] <JD-Robbs> Eviltwin: Haha, cool cheers ;) ... Thing is, I've got quite a bulk of domains to secure and that was the cheapest I could find so far.
[13:59:22] <Mehrdad> i got dc'd
[13:59:29] <chovy> Dreamhost kicked me off for running an autoblog :)
[13:59:37] <JD-Robbs> Eviltwin and chovy: Cheers for the pointers, I'll check them out :)
[14:00:13] <chovy> JD-Robbs: retailmenot.com has $5 coupons for netfirms.
[14:00:16] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: If all you're looking to do is domain squat
[14:00:28] <Eviltwin> GoDaddy might be okay or name.com
[14:00:37] <chovy> namepro or sedo
[14:00:43] <Eviltwin> But prepare for a nightmare if you ever want to host with GoDaddy or transfer from them
[14:00:44] <chovy> if you're squating
[14:00:54] <z0n3d> Krinkle, when I do this, $.getJSON(url+jsonp, function(data) {console.log(data)}); I end up getting an array (the proper length/number of objects that it should return if it was successful) of __proto__ objects
[14:01:03] <chovy> iv'e transferred away from godaddy. wasn't a problem.
[14:01:07] <JD-Robbs> Squatting for only around three months. Then I want to point them to my server
[14:01:28] <JD-Robbs> chovy: Wow, thanks for the tip :)
[14:01:43] <chovy> i like netfirms.
[14:01:53] <chovy> they're all about $12/year.
[14:01:56] <JD-Robbs> But all of the above have simple DNS management and I can use their nameservers, right?
[14:02:02] <chovy> but netfirms has a coupon for $5.
[14:02:10] <Mkop> keep in mind that it is neither necessary nor advisable to use the same company as registrar and webhost
[14:02:33] <chovy> JD-Robbs: netfirms is a registrar. They have basic hosting, but it's crap I'm sure.
[14:02:46] <JD-Robbs> Mkop: Yes exactly, I am purely looking for domain management since I wish to point them to my own server
[14:02:50] <chovy> use dreamhost or mediatempl
[14:03:10] <Mkop> registrar also doesn't need to manage your DNS
[14:03:26] <Mehrdad> sorry got dc'd again
[14:03:52] <Krinkle> z0n3d: please show the real code you have + your php (you can leave out any sensitive stuff). I can't help you otherwise
[14:04:05] <JD-Robbs> Mkop: Hmm, I didn't quite understand that. My knowledge of domain management ends at pointing them to my server's IP :( haha
[14:04:09] <z0n3d> Krinkle, it's exactly what you posted.
[14:04:31] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Apparently not, as I know it works.
[14:04:39] <Krinkle> sorry, don't mean to sound harsh
[14:04:47] <Mkop> registrar registers the domain for you. most/all registrars will also have DNS management tools, or you can tell them to use some other nameserver
[14:04:50] <JD-Robbs> Also, if I wish to use a domain that is registered with GoDaddy via SSL on a sever that I own in Germany, will that be a problem?
[14:04:56] <Krinkle> z0n3d: what is the $.getJSON line you have ?
[14:05:05] <JD-Robbs> Mkop: Excellent, thank you very much
[14:05:16] <z0n3d> Krinkle, it does work, as I said it's clearly querying the databse and returning because it is the right NUMBER of objects. but the objects aren't the json objects I want, they're these __proto__ objects
[14:05:27] <z0n3d> Krinkle, $.getJSON(url+jsonp, function(data) {console.log(data)});
[14:05:37] <Krinkle> what is +jsonp doing ?
[14:05:46] <z0n3d> +"&callback=?"
[14:05:55] <Krinkle> and url ?
[14:05:57] <Krinkle> (rouhgly)
[14:06:27] <z0n3d> if i remove the +jsonp and typed the url into my browser, it returns me the correct json info
[14:06:46] <JD-Robbs> Eviltwin: If I may ask, what kind of problems did your friends have with GoDaddy? I am just trying to work-out if I'll put up with the same or opt for one of the others, cheers :D
[14:07:31] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Can you open that url including the &callback=foobar in your browser and copy and paste it here ? (if it's too long, cut out the long middle part of the json object itself)
[14:07:31] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: Their customer service is shit
[14:07:46] <muzone> JD-Robbs: and they've been known to steal domains
[14:08:03] <JD-Robbs> Eviltwin: Provided that I can do 99% of what I need on-line I could deal with that... Hmmm
[14:08:11] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Now THAT's not cool
[14:08:15] <pom> How do I attach some arbitraty data to a jQuery object now again?
[14:08:15] <muzone> like if you're one day late with the payment, they'll grab it for themselves and charge thousands of dollars for it
[14:08:23] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Surely, that's illegal?
[14:08:32] <muzone> nope
[14:08:41] <muzone> this is my experience with them though
[14:08:41] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Well, at least as long as you pay
[14:08:44] <z0n3d> Krinkle, foo([{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]) :(
[14:08:45] <muzone> but i still use them :)
[14:08:57] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Okay, but good to know still - so thanks :)
[14:08:59] <muzone> at least their UI works better now than before
[14:09:03] <Krinkle> z0n3d: okay, so it's an numeral array of objects
[14:09:05] <muzone> yup
[14:09:18] <z0n3d> Krinkle, removing the &callback gives me the correct info ... does this mean it's the PHP that's bad?
[14:09:51] <Krinkle> z0n3d: The only visual difference should be  [{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]  <---> foo ( [{},{},{},{},{},{},{}] )
[14:09:57] <Krinkle> is there more difference ?
[14:10:05] <z0n3d> Krinkle, the data is empty!
[14:10:13] <JD-Robbs> muzone: One question if I may ask. I don't understand their symbols and small-print actually... From your own experience, are the strikethrough prices the ones charged after the first year?
[14:10:18] <Krinkle> z0n3d: Then you need to show me more php code
[14:10:22] <z0n3d> 1 sec
[14:10:32] <Krinkle> I happen to know php, so I can check it out. but this really isn't a javascript issue at this point
[14:10:48] <Mehrdad> how call a parent object's method?
[14:11:00] <z0n3d> Krinkle, http://pastebin.com/Vw6cVtQa
[14:11:14] <Eviltwin> Mehrdad: Explain further what you mean
[14:11:23] <z0n3d> (i know it should be rewritten because it's dumb, i'm just trying to get it to work first)
[14:11:23] <muzone> JD-Robbs: not sure
[14:11:36] <muzone> to me the price has been the same
[14:11:45] <Krinkle> z0n3d:  what is CJSON::encode ?
[14:12:01] <muzone> they always try to trick you at checkout though to include a lot of useless stuff into your shopping bag so look out hehe
[14:12:03] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Thanks, not to worry. The difference is anyway not too great. Only for some stuff like .eu and .co
[14:12:08] <z0n3d> Krinkle, i'm using the Yii framework.... perhaps i should replace the json_encode with CJSON::encode
[14:12:15] <muzone> cool
[14:12:15] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Hahaha, yeah I saw that!
[14:12:31] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Can you get rid of the privacy option at a later point for free?
[14:12:38] <muzone> oh yeah
[14:12:54] <z0n3d> Krinkle, ahh, that did it. thanks!
[14:13:07] <JD-Robbs> Thank you! Excellent, because they're offering it for free for bulk registrations
[14:13:11] <Krinkle> z0n3d: You're welcome
[14:13:22] <Krinkle> z0n3d: I guess $data is not a regular php array/object, but needs conversion first
[14:13:35] <Krinkle> z0n3d: You can remove "$cb"
[14:13:49] <z0n3d> guess i kinda figured CJSON::encode couldn't do much more than regular json_encode ... i assumed $data was a normal object as you said
[14:14:39] <Krinkle> z0n3d: http://pastebin.com/tCg0AUnu
[14:14:47] <z0n3d> Krinkle, i know
[14:15:10] <Krinkle> z0n3d: ok ok :)
[14:15:13] <z0n3d> ty :)
[14:15:46] <z0n3d> when i get frustrated that something isn't working i just start hammering keys... then once it works i pretty it up. lol
[14:19:12] <te-brian> ugh.. I hate IE
[14:19:14] <baxter-> back
[14:21:01] <Advocated> Hi there, am i right in thinking a html page shouldnt have 2 jquery files linked, ie for 2 different versions?
[14:21:40] <Eviltwin> Advocated: In the ideal case, no
[14:21:46] <Eviltwin> There should only be one version
[14:24:37] <JD-Robbs> muzone: Sorry for nagging you but - updates of whois records are always free, right? As in address changes and stuff
[14:26:02] <Advocated> Eviltwin, thanks

[14:28:10] <muzone> JD-Robbs: yup those are always free
[14:28:40] <JD-Robbs> Excellent, cheers buddy :D
[14:28:58] <muzone> :>
[14:30:36] <Mkop> is this a sane way of doing things? $("#details .person_name").after($("<div class='error'/>").text(data.errormsg));
[14:31:25] <Zzaichik> Okay, I have an unordered list that I'm animating. It's acting as a carousel adjusting the positioning and it's switching the opacity. In IE 7 and 8 the text gets a black border, looks pixelated and ugly. Anyone seen this? And know of a fix?
[14:33:01] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Any chance you could give this a look?
[14:33:02] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/a6yGX/
[14:33:15] <LordThumper> It is regarding the PubSub you told me about earlier
[14:35:53] <JD-Robbs> How brilliant is the Round-Up-For-Charity thing! I love it when companies do that :)
[14:37:57] <LordThumper> I am trying to understand the PubSub code, what is this $({}) exactly?
[14:38:07] <LordThumper> Is the code binding the events to {} ?
[14:38:10] <Eviltwin> Essentially an empty jQuery object
[14:38:11] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[14:38:31] <LordThumper> Ah I see, is that instead of my Dummy element?
[14:39:13] <LordThumper> Ok think I got the code, thanks alot Eviltwin

[14:40:12] <muzone> Eviltwin: have updated the case with what we discussed earlier: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/26/
[14:46:45] <hays> Anyone know what this means? "I prefer the named function expression method of setting a function's name, for some rather in-depth and technical reasons. You are likely to see both methods used in others' JavaScript code."
[14:48:22] <coldhead> function this_name () {} as opposed to this_name = function () {}
[14:51:02] <Es0teric> i have a <ul> list of items… and each <li> has a <h1> tag with divs that have separate classes in it… now when i try to toggle one item to show, it shows all the sub items with the classes associated with it… my question is, how do i make the toggle only toggle the children under each li individually? kinda like an accordion list but not quite
[14:53:14] <hays> coldhead: yes but why
[14:54:15] <coldhead> you mean what's the difference?
[14:54:42] <coldhead> the named function method will let you run the function "above" its declaration later in the file
[14:54:53] <hays> why does this author prefer the named method
[14:55:05] <coldhead> the var func_name = ... method lets you shake things up more, but you can't run the function until it's been assigned
[14:55:19] <coldhead> i don't know why the author prefers it
[14:55:22] <coldhead> i suspect he is an idiot
[14:55:25] <hays> hmm
[14:55:32] <coldhead> it's a matter of taste
[14:55:46] <hays> well i got the link from this channel http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-1
[14:55:50] <ASUChander> When I'm using jquery-ui's slider and trigger an event $('#slider').trigger('change') I find that no ui element is passed to the handler
[14:55:57] <coldhead> let me find you an example i wrote for an idiot cow orker, hays
[14:55:59] <ASUChander> is there a way I can pass the ui element?
[14:56:10] <coldhead> oh mr r murphey is a bona fide genius
[14:56:15] <coldhead> you should do whatever he says
[14:56:26] <ASUChander> my handler is defined as function (event, ui) { alert(ui.values); }
[14:56:34] <andrew9183> r murphey is a girl
[14:56:39] <andrew9183> rebecca
[14:57:15] <hays> unfortunately she doesnt explain why she prefers one way to the other (link is dead)
[14:57:27] <coldhead> he's never corrected me when i have called him mr
[14:57:38] <coldhead> although rebecca is an unusual name for a fellow
[14:57:41] <keybo> hi, can anyone tell me how the pixel value for the height of the visible window?
[14:57:47] <keybo> how to get the*
[14:58:13] <hays> rdmurphy: why do you prefer using var foo = function() { ... }
[14:58:25] <coldhead> hays: http://jsfiddle.net/9VegN/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/9VegN/1/
[14:58:44] <coldhead> the latter lets you dynamically declare functions, which i like
[14:58:49] <coldhead> the first fails to do so
[14:59:11] <Krinkle> ASUChander: It's called "slidechange"
[14:59:30] <Krinkle> ASUChander: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/ -> Events -> change
[14:59:39] <coldhead> i think that's a different r murphey
[15:00:00] <ASUChander> Krinkle: I know that.  I'm trying to trigger the event manually
[15:00:18] <ASUChander> using trigger(), and it triggers fine - but the ui object isn't passed in (it is when it's changed by the user)
[15:00:49] <Krinkle> ASUChander: okay, but know that you should use trigger("slidechange") in any case
[15:00:51] <keybo> Sorry, would anyone mind telling me how to get the pixel value for the height of the visible window?
[15:01:05] <coldhead> $(window).height()
[15:01:13] <keybo> that easy huh :p
[15:01:15] <keybo> thanks
[15:01:28] <ASUChander> ahh, I see what' youre saying.  I'm actually using "trigger("slide")"
[15:01:48] <ASUChander> but in any case, the ui argument is provided for some reason
[15:01:54] <ASUChander> (when it's manually triggered.)
[15:02:04] <Krinkle> ?trigger | ASUChander
[15:02:05] <bot-t1> Krinkle, .trigger() - Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[15:02:32] <Krinkle> ASUChander: Second parameter of trigger is 'data' that is also routed to any callers for the second argument
[15:02:46] <Krinkle> so trigger("slidechange", { your UI object }) should work
[15:02:53] <ASUChander> Okay, so then (the follow on question) is how do I get a UI object?

[15:08:47] <Krinkle> but not a plain ui object
[15:15:05] <cybersholt> question: anybody know how i can align images around a circular div?
[15:19:25] <cybersholt> hmmm i guess circles are just a pain
[15:20:11] <z1000> with css3 can you have one BG image... then another one fades on top of it.. all in the same element? currently i use js with like an <em> ex... <a>text<em></em></a> curious if there is a better way?
[15:21:15] <Es0teric> i have a <ul> list of items… and each <li> has a <h1> tag with divs that have separate classes in it… now when i try to toggle one item to show, it shows all the sub items with the classes associated with it… my question is, how do i make the toggle only toggle the children under each li individually? kinda like an accordion list but not quite
[15:21:19] <snover> z1000: no
[15:21:26] <snover> z1000: someday though!
[15:21:53] <keybo> what do you mean by fades on top of it?
[15:22:05] <coldhead> cross fading
[15:22:09] <coldhead> like on the teevee
[15:24:29] <Es0teric> cold head, do you know how to do what i am talking about?
[15:24:30] <Es0teric> *coldhead
[15:25:08] <eddiemonge> no, its coldhead's first day. he doesnt know anything
[15:26:44] <coldhead> two divs with position: absolute in the same position and fade them in and out simultaneously
[15:26:51] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, you're funny

[15:36:55] <LordThumper> Is there any way to convert a String Object into a console.log(ableObject)?
[15:36:58] <whoever> hi all i am trying to use jquery to add an onclick event. reason. mobile and jquery don't really work, so i tried to add this line and nothing,  $("#softOptBtn").setAttribute("onClick", Help());
[15:37:04] <whoever> can someone assist
[15:37:16] <LordThumper> $.each(ArrayOfStrings, function() { console.log(this) })
[15:37:44] <LordThumper> It is displaying an Object with an array of chars instead of the string itself
[15:38:10] <LordThumper> In Chrome console
[15:40:12] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: jsfiddle what you are trying

[15:41:56] <bgranger> Hi, in the guthub master of jquery UI there is only the "base" theme.  Is it possible to generate the other stock themes for the dev version of jquery UI?
[15:42:23] <cybersholt> bgranger
[15:42:23] <cybersholt> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[15:42:48] <bgranger> I see that but the resulting theme won't have the markup for widgets added since last release, no?
[15:43:20] <cybersholt> i would think it would have u tried it?
[15:44:02] <sasori> hi, am seeing a "o is not defined" thing at the console of firebug ..can someone tell me what that means?
[15:44:39] <bgranger> cybersholt: yes I have tried it and it only include the styling for widgets in the last stable release
[15:44:52] <cybersholt> damn
[15:45:11] <bgranger> cybersholt: is the themeroller source available?  I didn't see it on github
[15:46:07] <BinaryKitten> sasori .. we're going to need more information. o is not defined means that something is trying to use the variable o and the code that's trying to use it finds that whatever o is meant to be, is not there.
[15:46:25] <cybersholt> im not 100% on that but i think it may not be available, on the other hand u could rip it and run it thru jsbeautifier to make it readable maybe
[15:46:26] <sasori> ok, got it..thanks :)
[15:46:36] <Cheery> I look for something similar to 'change' with exception that it fires all the time when textarea contents are being changed
[15:46:49] <Cheery> you.. know one?
[15:47:04] <cybersholt> sorry im not much of a help bgranger kinda rackin my brain atm
[15:47:33] <bgranger> cybersholt:  no problem, at least I know i am not missing something obvious...
[15:47:50] <cybersholt> yeah
[15:50:30] <whoever> bot-t1: so if i got it right i can't set the onclick .attr, i need to bind. correct?
[15:50:31] <bot-t1> whoever, Don't count on it.

[15:57:05] <Cheery> oh it's enough to just bind 'input'
[15:57:36] <BinaryKitten> don't bind
[15:57:41] <BinaryKitten> use .on
[15:58:02] <BinaryKitten> (unless it's an old version of jQuery)
[15:58:09] <nFFF> Can I mix jQuery and jscript?
[15:58:14] <nFFF> or is that not kewl
[15:58:19] <BinaryKitten> nFFF lovely question
[15:58:23] <BinaryKitten> what is jquery?
[15:58:27] <coldhead> it's the same thing, buddy
[15:58:55] <coldhead> $('*').remove(); // This code is 100% Javascript
[15:59:01] <BinaryKitten> nFFF in the end, it depends on what you're mising
[15:59:05] <BinaryKitten> *mixing
[15:59:09] <nFFF> no performance issues etc?
[15:59:18] <BinaryKitten> no performance issues, in general
[15:59:26] <BinaryKitten> you might have some with your code though
[15:59:30] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: thanks from tip
[15:59:32] <BinaryKitten> we can't say that
[15:59:59] <Cheery> is the 'input' event valid if I want to flag the text field for updating?
[16:00:18] <BinaryKitten> urm is there an "input" event?
[16:00:21] <Cheery> I'm playing with the idea of writing a collaborative editor. :)
[16:00:29] <nFFF> Ive only ever worked with jQuery and now I have to edit some pure jscript
[16:00:52] <te-brian> What is the most performant way to repond to a table row when it becomes 'visible' (enters the viewport) ?
[16:00:59] <BinaryKitten> Cheery I like your enthusiasm
[16:01:05] <eddiemonge> nFFF: what is jscript?
[16:01:23] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge javascript as referred to by microsoft
[16:01:24] <te-brian> i.e. a long-ass table the user scrolls through
[16:01:27] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: http://jsfiddle.net/xbTeL/
[16:01:29] <nFFF> tired 1am way of typing javascript
[16:01:51] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: i was hoping no one would say that
[16:02:31] <BinaryKitten> heh, it's history
[16:02:47] <BinaryKitten> we can't improve if we don't learn from it
[16:02:48] <BinaryKitten> :)
[16:03:48] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: I think I have one question which arised from .on
[16:04:22] <BinaryKitten> ok
[16:04:41] <Cheery> if I want to support the case in which there's many collaborative editors on the view, with different content in them.. which would be the nicest way to store state of each of the editors?
[16:05:03] <BinaryKitten> that has nothing to do with .on
[16:05:08] <Cheery> considering I want to define collaborative editor with <textarea class="editor"></textarea>
[16:05:56] <BinaryKitten> Cheery so, you don't need help with .on you want advice on how to build your application?
[16:06:24] <igcewieling> when using clone, how are named elements inside the cloned element handled?
[16:06:41] <eddiemonge> named elements? like .... ?
[16:06:47] <BinaryKitten> the content is cloned with it igcewieling
[16:06:48] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: well it's related to .on in a way, that I get input from multiple different elements if I have many of those that matches the selector.
[16:06:49] <igcewieling> <div id="bob">
[16:07:11] <eddiemonge> thats not named. those are elements with ids. and they are copied, id and all
[16:07:37] <igcewieling> eddiemonge: After the clone I have two elements with the same ID?
[16:07:45] <nFFF> Any function in jQuery will copy the onchange="" value?
[16:08:02] <BinaryKitten> Cheery, same with any call on a jquery object. It applies to all items within the collection
[16:08:20] <BinaryKitten> nFFF define "copy" for me please?
[16:08:30] <eddiemonge> igcewieling: yes. you cloned it
[16:08:50] <eddiemonge> nFFF: the onchange event handler?
[16:08:58] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: jquery still had some way to attach custom data on elements though?
[16:09:21] <BinaryKitten> .data
[16:09:31] <nFFF> eddiemonge ye
[16:09:36] <BinaryKitten> Cheery it's all there in teh api documentation
[16:09:40] <nFFF> BinaryKitten, save the value to a variable
[16:09:49] <BinaryKitten> .attr nFFF
[16:09:53] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: oh okay. :)
[16:10:05] <eddiemonge> nFFF: well first of all you shouldnt be using inline JS handlers
[16:10:08] <fulcan> I have a script .js/init.js. that I am trying to call on from a directive in my layout.CSS and unsure of the syntax. I setup the action .<div id=.messages.. in my index.php and cannot figure out how to call on my .id=messages. from layout.css and initiate the init.js script?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531962/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531963/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531964/
[16:10:26] <Kaffi> Trying to use show() in order to make all my spans visible. Using sample code from the jquery site, but it only works for the spans that are directly after eachother. If there is another element, like a <br> between two spns it wont work http://jsfiddle.net/ScMUr/36/
[16:10:28] <nFFF> BinaryKitten, basically I'm iterating through a documents .select tags, and I'm copying the data to a <span>, need to copy .className and onchange
[16:10:30] <fulcan> js/init.js script is just a simple fade script. I setup my id for the segment of code I want to perform this action on in my blah.php. The intelligent place to put the 'trigger' is in .css so that I can span the action in multiple places. Just can't find the proper syntax of how to 'call' or 'trigger' my 'id' class?
[16:10:32] <nFFF> but not sure how to do onchange
[16:10:42] <BinaryKitten> wow fulcan you sure do type fast
[16:10:48] <nFFF> eddiemonge, its a CMS
[16:10:56] <fulcan> BinaryKitten  :)
[16:11:07] <BinaryKitten> oh the actual event?
[16:11:14] <eddiemonge> nFFF: thats no excuse.   var onchange = $(ele).attr('onchange')
[16:11:19] <igcewieling> I am trying to clone the <div id="account_list"> with the clone being named "account_list_dialog" and append the element to the end of the body of the page.  I tried this, but I get a syntax error, I'm still a bit of a n00b.  $('<div id="account_list_dialog"></div>') = $('#account_list').clone(); $('#account_list_dialog').appendTo($('body'));
[16:11:45] <Dr4g> i have HTML inside a <textarea> i'm sending it over $.post() and it's being auto escaped over the wire... my HTML now is &lt; instead of <
[16:11:50] <nFFF> eddiemonge, you want me to re-write the whole cms?
[16:11:55] * BinaryKitten is out for the night
[16:12:05] <nFFF> Thats not realistic in the real world unfortunately
[16:12:11] <nFFF> BinaryKitten thanks for your help
[16:12:37] <eddiemonge> igcewieling: var clone = $('#account_list').clone();  clone[0].id = 'account_list_dialog'; clone.appendTo('body');
[16:13:02] <BinaryKitten> bah eddiemonge
[16:13:12] <eddiemonge> Dr4g: how are you sending it?
[16:13:15] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: what?
[16:13:39] <BinaryKitten> $('#account_list').clone().attr('id','account_list_dialog').appendTo('body');
[16:13:50] <whoever> eddiemonge: wow.... bot-t1 can i take you out behind the old 386 and give msDos
[16:14:12] <BinaryKitten> wtf whoever?
[16:14:27] <whoever> eddiemonge: .bind will work but on mobile the action will not execute
[16:14:31] <igcewieling> eddiemonge, BinaryKitten: Thanks!
[16:14:46] <Dr4g> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/1592104
[16:15:00] <eddiemonge> whoever: why not?
[16:15:07] <Dr4g> i checked.. when i do .html() on my textarea the content becomes escaped into html-entities instead of its raw form.
[16:15:31] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: yeah yeah. i always forget what .clone() returns .... even though i wrote part of that api doc page 8(
[16:15:43] <BinaryKitten> :)
[16:15:45] <whoever> eddiemonge:  i click the button that the event is assignd to , and it works on desktop, on mobile, i click the button and nothing
[16:16:14] <BinaryKitten> whoever depending on the device, it may not trigger the "click" event
[16:16:24] <eddiemonge> Dr4g: and whats receiving the input? that should work like a normal form. have you tried doing it as a normal form?
[16:16:40] <BinaryKitten> mobile events are different, you need to look into other things
[16:16:56] <eddiemonge> whoever: what mobile? you might need touch or tap instead of click
[16:17:01] <Dr4g> eddiemonge: i've fixed it by doing html_entity_decode() in the PHP receiving the ajax call
[16:17:32] <CryptoFreak> Hi everyone. I'm new to JQuery and am having trouble using the $.get() call and click() events. For some reason, my code isn't working. Can anyone give me a clue as to why? http://pastebin.com/zpFW40bn
[16:18:17] <whoever> eddiemonge: right now android, i looked at jqtouch  and it involved making a second page just for mobile, and i am trying to not do that
[16:18:24] <ohcibi> IE<=8 does create a null-value when having a trailing comma in an array elements list ([a, b,] == [a, b, null]) >8-|
[16:18:44] <NackNick> can someone help ive been stuck on this stupid problem for 2 days and cant figure out where its coming from or whats generating it, im getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < on my site
[16:18:53] <eddiemonge> Dr4g: thats what i was hinting at
[16:19:06] <ohcibi> NackNick: somehow your html gets parsed as js
[16:19:10] <NackNick> i need it gone so the alert doesnt come up in ie
[16:19:27] <eddiemonge> CryptoFreak: what fails? does the alert not get called?
[16:19:30] <ohcibi> NackNick: OR you forgot to quote html code which you intended to use as a string value in js
[16:19:42] <BinaryKitten> CryptoFreak i can see the issue
[16:19:56] <eddiemonge> whoever: you need to bind to the mobile touch events too then
[16:20:04] <NackNick> I took off the any custom jquery on the site
[16:20:07] <BinaryKitten> CryptoFreak which browser are you using?
[16:20:09] <NackNick> and it still showed
[16:20:10] <eddiemonge> NackNick: jshint.com your code
[16:20:29] <CryptoFreak> BinaryKitten: I'm using Google Chrome. Does the issue have to do with where I've placed my code?
[16:20:30] <eddiemonge> NackNick: you have a typo somewhere
[16:20:30] <NackNick> well its several js files
[16:20:32] <NackNick> not just one
[16:20:37] <BinaryKitten> CryptoFreak not at all
[16:20:54] <NackNick> would it help if you saw the site and you can see the error?
[16:20:54] <BinaryKitten> CryptoFreak press F12 in Chrome, look at the console tab
[16:20:54] <CryptoFreak> BinaryKitten: Oh. So then I am obviously completely lost lol
[16:21:07] <BinaryKitten> reload the page and see what you get
[16:21:10] <CryptoFreak> BinaryKitten: OK, hang on.
[16:21:25] <ohcibi> hm... i also jshinted my code... seem to insert that comma afterwards...
[16:21:34] <eddiemonge> CryptoFreak: http://www.jshint.com/reports/153036
[16:21:34] <BinaryKitten> I believe you will get an error telling you that the code is missing something
[16:22:06] <BinaryKitten> bah eddiemonge they never learn to use the tools, if you give them the answers like that
[16:22:24] <CodeZombie> is it possible to handle special chars ( exclamation, for example) in a jquery selector? Here's the specific on I noticed the bug on... data-tag="demo!"
[16:22:35] <eddiemonge> but im showing them the tools. you know, leading them to the water
[16:22:39] <CodeZombie> the ! causes an issue, and escaping it with \\! throws an error as well
[16:22:48] <CryptoFreak> BinaryKitten: Yes, I do. So apparently, I either left out an ; or a ) somwhere. Thank you!

[16:23:08] <whoever> eddiemonge: when i tried to include jquery_min last night , my page thaught i didn't have js enabled on my desktop or phone
[16:23:10] <BinaryKitten> CryptoFreak if you see eddiemonge's link it explains everything
[16:23:23] <CryptoFreak> BinaryKitten: Thanks. Going to look at it now
[16:23:30] <eddiemonge> whoever: maybe you didnt
[16:24:13] <CodeZombie> eddiemonge: right, I know i need to escape it, but for some reason [data-tag=demo\\!] gives me Syntax error, unrecognized expression
[16:24:15] <igcewieling> could I access these elements with duplicated IDs (because of using .clone) as (from my earlier example) as $('#account_list_dialog #close_btn') or does that not make any sense?
[16:24:55] <CodeZombie> ah, nvm
[16:25:02] <CodeZombie> bad coder, missing quotes
[16:25:10] <Kaffi> i'm using jquery.com:s example of animating hidden elements one after another. But it's not very general...it requires all elements you want to show to be directly after each other. as soon as it encounters a different element, it stops. How cn I modify it so that it's more general and owrks for EVERY element on the page, no matter where it's placed? http://jsfiddle.net/Z42nq/
[16:25:18] <BinaryKitten> igcewieling after cloning, do find
[16:25:40] <whoever> eddiemonge: i checked and both FF and chrome said it was enabled
[16:25:42] <adfasdfj> Anyone in here familiar with isotope?
[16:25:55] <BinaryKitten> eg clonedItem.find('#close_btn').attr('id','another_btn')

[16:26:43] <Blazento> hi. what do you do when you have view logic that impacts the amount of content within a div. I have been having issues with my containers overlapping when i change the content within a div... when the content in my div gets larger the size, the div itself will expand, but its corresponding neighbor div get overshadowed by the first bigger div.. how do people deal with this
[16:28:06] <eddiemonge> Kaffi: read .next() and i think youll see what the problem is see ? next
[16:28:06] <bot-t1> Kaffi, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[16:28:53] <eddiemonge> Kaffi: and then see ? nextall
[16:28:53] <bot-t1> Kaffi, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[16:29:33] <eddiemonge> Blazento: you could look at templates or adjust the size of the neighbors when the others change
[16:30:18] <Blazento> i'm using jquery templates... it seems like my app will get unmanagable if i'm explicity setting the height of each div on change
[16:31:55] <eddiemonge> Blazento: maybe you need to look at the problem differently
[16:34:50] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: you know which would be nicest way to generate html in javascript? For example when parsing wiki markup on client.
[16:35:11] <Kaffi> eddiemonge: Ah, ok. what a bummer that next works like that. I expected it to get the first matching sibling
[16:36:13] <BinaryKitten> Cheery sure, I charge £50 per hour to write code for you, and be on beck and call to answer all questions.
[16:36:29] <Kaffi> eddiemonge: so i guess it's something like nextAll("div:first") to get the first matching sibling
[16:36:58] <eddiemonge> no, nextAll('div') works fine or you can use nextAll('div').first()
[16:37:04] <eddiemonge> .first() is faster than :first
[16:37:46] <BinaryKitten> :first gets all 1st children, and then filters that by ones that are a div
[16:37:59] <Cheery> BinaryKitten: what I look is for useful libraries and routines. I don't ask you to write code for me.
[16:38:12] <BinaryKitten> Cheery stop targeting me
[16:39:21] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: what about :last and .last()?
[16:39:41] <BinaryKitten> I can't help you with your code, I can't tell you what to do in this regard. I can only help with particular issues you might  have. If you have a particular issue with some code, then please create a pastebin for it and ask the channel
[16:40:09] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge the same,
[16:40:24] <BinaryKitten> jquery (and CSS) is a right to left system
[16:40:47] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: lol i know. i was just messing with you
[16:41:18] <BinaryKitten> its now (minus lag) 12:41 am eddiemonge sorry, don't comprehend messing
[16:42:35] <Kaffi> Ok, will use next("div").first(). Thanks for the help!
[16:42:46] <Kaffi> *nextAll("div").first() i mean
[16:45:44] <Cheery> ookay.. I think I've got everything looked up I needed for now.
[16:46:33] <Cheery> encodeURI + html escaping routine stolen from Prototype.js will let me generate html with concatenating strings.

[16:55:18] <CryptoFreak> eddiemonge: isn't that jsonp?
[16:56:04] <eddiemonge> json !== jsonp
[16:56:25] <eddiemonge> ?jsonp @ CryptoFreak
[16:56:25] <bot-t1> CryptoFreak, JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[16:56:49] <CryptoFreak> Hmm, ok makes sense. Off to do more research. Thanks, eddie1
[17:02:27] <CryptoFreak> So if I understand correctly, the service I'm calling has to support jsonp as well, right? Because what I'm getting is a 404 error when the callback is included.
[17:03:49] <eddiemonge> CryptoFreak: right
[17:04:21] <CryptoFreak> eddie: thanks. So there's no way around the x-domain restriction without a proxy if the service doesn't support jsonp?
[17:04:36] <ohcibi> its a clients restriction, so no
[17:05:47] <CryptoFreak> Crap
[17:06:12] <CryptoFreak> So I guess I'll implement a PHP proxy that will then grab data from the service and set it back to my script. That's a pain in the ass lol
[17:06:49] <eddiemonge> yup. but its there for a security reason
[17:08:03] <ohcibi> CryptoFreak: thats the way you do it
[17:09:27] <ohcibi> CryptoFreak: consider using node.js or similar for the service
[17:09:43] <eddiemonge> or php if you have it
[17:09:58] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: my tip was to avoid apache/php 8-))
[17:10:03] <eddiemonge> or ruby or python or .... <insert backend language here>
[17:10:17] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: thats still not what i was suggesting 8-))
[17:11:01] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with php?
[17:11:23] <eddiemonge> php is the jquery of the backend languages
[17:11:36] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: nothing but node.js is a different approach.. you wont put it into a doc-root of any webserver.. it _is_ your webserver creating way less load for a simple service like that
[17:11:52] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: read on node.js its kind of a new concept...
[17:12:07] <eddiemonge> unless you are already running php. then its additional load
[17:12:09] <whoever> eddiemonge: i have jquery min and mobile set , but it is some how putting the button text to the left of all buttons as well as leaving the text on the button . if i comment out those two scripts it doesn't happen any ideas
[17:12:35] <eddiemonge> whoever: huh? see ? demo
[17:12:36] <bot-t1> whoever, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[17:12:38] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: no because it only creates load when it hits the service (belive me: read on it 8-)) its new)
[17:13:26] <eddiemonge> ohcibi: i know what node is and what it can do. php is similiar. only creates load when it hits the service
[17:13:36] <eddiemonge> like i said, just different backends
[17:14:07] <ohcibi> eddiemonge: implement the sample webserver on the node.js homepage.. do an apache benchmark with 10000 concurrent requests, compare, see
[17:14:09] <ohcibi> 8-))
[17:20:49] <whoever> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/xEDY4/
[17:22:46] <igcewieling> $(this) is a <tr>  I'm trying to get the contents of the 1st <td>, 2nd <td>, etc.  I thought maybe use $('this nth-child(2)').val(), but this does not work.
[17:23:14] <eddiemonge> whoever: you need to add the mobile css as well: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/xEDY4/2/
[17:23:23] <ohcibi> $(this).find(':nth-child(2)');
[17:24:07] <ohcibi> igcewieling: ^
[17:24:15] <eddiemonge> $(this).find('td').eq(2)
[17:24:22] <igcewieling> I should think of using .find() more often.  this is the second time the solution of a question involved .find()
[17:24:34] <igcewieling> thanks!
[17:25:01] <eddiemonge> .eq should be faster than nth-child
[17:25:48] <ohcibi> shouldnt it be eq(1) then? dont know if nth-child is zero-based
[17:26:41] <whoever_> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/xEDY4/3/
[17:27:01] <whoever_> eddiemonge: see butt text also appears right next to button
[17:27:20] <eddiemonge> whoever_: yeah because you arent including jquery mobile's css file
[17:27:32] <eddiemonge> and in that example your html has an error
[17:28:09] <troubleman> eddiemonge: dont be promoting php up in here
[17:29:09] <whoever_> eddiemonge: i was thinking and hopping it would default to myown css
[17:30:26] <eddiemonge> whoever_: it will if you define that
[17:30:32] <whoever_> eddiemonge: thx  for helping the blind
[17:31:37] <eddiemonge> specifically the class ui-btn-hidden

[17:47:27] <hravula> hi
[17:51:13] <vladikoff> hey hravula
[17:56:14] <paupl> Hi Everyone. I have a quick question (I hope its not a stupid one, I have googled and looked for the answer myself). For some reason if i use $.getScript inside $('document').ready() or $('window').load it will not work in Firefox. It works fine in IE. If i use <body onLoad="init()"> and have the $.getScript in init() it works fine in Firefox.
[17:57:03] <paupl> should I be able to use it inside $('document').ready() or $('window').load?
[17:59:40] <ajauhri_> Why is the div field on showing or hiding on click? http://pastebin.me/d8a17c1d84183fcc6364df81890859a4
[18:03:06] <mparodi> argh! why it doesn't show any error in JS files added with .getScript? -.-"
[18:03:17] <mparodi> it crashes silently
[18:03:32] <paupl> yeah!
[18:04:53] <mparodi> isn't there a better idea than .getScript?
[18:05:24] <paupl> possibly
[18:05:40] <Guest27945> better idea for what?
[18:05:55] <paupl> im basicly grabbing the id of the page, then using that i am loading the scripts that page nees
[18:05:57] <paupl> needs*
[18:06:15] <mparodi> uh?
[18:06:21] <mparodi> how do you load them?
[18:06:42] <Guest27945> .load()
[18:06:42] <Guest27945> ?
[18:07:34] <paupl> $.getScript(pageId + "_scripts.js");
[18:08:13] <paupl> it works fine in IE, and it works fine in Firefox when I load it using something like <body onLoad="init();"> but it doesn't run in IE inside $('document').ready() or $('window').load
[18:08:31] <adfasdfj> Hey guys, anyone familiar with Isotope.js?
[18:08:43] <adfasdfj> If so, I'd really appreciate someone looking at this barebones code: http://jsfiddle.net/NWPDf/
[18:09:19] <adfasdfj> Works when you simply initialize Isotope.
[18:09:29] <adfasdfj> And the array is holding the right data...
[18:09:53] <adfasdfj> But for some reason, it's not updating when you select different options.
[18:10:04] <adfasdfj> (look at console for array updates)
[18:10:41] <Guest27945> what should be happening?
[18:10:52] <Guest27945> all i see is text inside of theresult
[18:10:58] <_zoggy_> btw jui in topic is at 1.8.17
[18:11:57] <adfasdfj> Guest27945: It should be loading all of the html .piece's, but it's not
[18:12:25] <Matiasu> my computer crashed after I tried to change the screen brightness o.o
[18:12:34] <Matiasu> I said... how do you load them, paupl?
[18:12:53] <paupl> $.getScript(pageId + "_scripts.js");
[18:13:00] <adfasdfj> Guest27945: Here are the items that should be appearing: http://jsfiddle.net/NWPDf/1/
[18:13:01] <paupl> it works fine in IE, and it works fine in Firefox when I load it using something like <body onLoad="init();"> but it doesn't run in IE inside $('document').ready() or $('window').load
[18:13:01] <Matiasu> ok, but you have the same problem
[18:13:17] <adfasdfj> Guest27945: (depending on what you've "highlighted" of course)
[18:13:46] <Matiasu> paupl, the problem is that sometimes you have errors that are not shown so you never notice them or where/why it's not working
[18:15:47] <Matiasu> it doesn't happen always tough
[18:16:06] <paupl> Matiasu: i don't understand?
[18:16:16] <paupl> there is nothing else going on in this file right now that 1.get the body id 2.load the file with that name.
[18:16:28] <paupl> it always works in IE, and never in firefox
[18:16:43] <paupl> unless I load it using <body onLoad="function()">
[18:18:26] <Matiasu> no no, you didn't get me
[18:19:21] <Matiasu> I'm talking about this problem: for example I have a JS file that I loaded using $.getScript, it seems it works because no error is thrown but once you try to use what it's supposed to do it doesn't work at all
[18:19:55] <Matiasu> so I instead loaded it by hand (the traditional way, not dynamically) and it says "SyntaxError: invalid regular expression flag $" on line 57!
[18:20:18] <Matiasu> I wonder why it doesn't say anything when I use $.getScript, that's the problem -.-
[18:20:30] <paupl> ahh i see what your saying
[18:21:02] <paupl> when it does seem to work for me I have been able to run code from the includes (just some basic conditionals and alerts)
[18:21:29] <Matiasu> I mean, I know where's the problem now, but I don't like having to include it by hand any time I *feel* something is wrong
[18:21:33] <wookiehangover> Matiasu: it sounds like its trying to parse the file as a regular expression
[18:21:41] <wookiehangover> have you run it through jshint
[18:21:57] <wookiehangover> or jslint
[18:22:07] <Matiasu> no, the problem is that I forgot a "/" at the beginning of the regexp :P
[18:22:13] <wookiehangover> yep, that'll do
[18:22:25] <wookiehangover> so jshint catches stuff like that
[18:22:27] <wookiehangover> just fyi
[18:22:42] <wookiehangover> and there are textmate / sublime text / vim plugins for it
[18:22:53] <Matiasu> I don't know what jshint is, let me see
[18:23:05] <wookiehangover> its radsauce
[18:23:14] <wookiehangover> http://www.jshint.com/
[18:24:14] <Matiasu> oh, ok, but... it should print the error when I use $.getScript, that's the point
[18:24:33] <wookiehangover> well not if the file is somehow invalid
[18:24:38] <wookiehangover> and it did print the error
[18:24:53] <paupl> no, it only printed the error once he manually included it
[18:24:53] <wookiehangover> it thought you had a screwed up regular expression
[18:24:56] <wookiehangover> orl
[18:24:58] <wookiehangover> y
[18:25:03] <wookiehangover> sorry, I just got here
[18:25:06] <wookiehangover> its my first day
[18:25:06] <Matiasu> wookiehangover, no, it didn't print it
[18:25:15] <kborchers> wookiehangover: u noob
[18:25:29] <paupl> no drama. its my issue. For some reason if i use $.getScript inside $('document').ready() or $('window').load it will not work in Firefox. It works fine in IE. If i use <body onLoad="init()"> and have the $.getScript in init() it works fine in Firefox.
[18:25:34] <wookiehangover> kboardshorts: yup, me and coldhead
[18:25:46] <kborchers> :D
[18:26:09] <paupl> but it seems, even when the file IS included, it doesn't print errors
[18:26:27] <wookiehangover> paupl: hrm, should be fine in firefox
[18:26:41] <wookiehangover> like, there are unit tests for that sort of thing in core
[18:27:12] <wookiehangover> paupl: why are you having to load a script like that
[18:27:23] <wookiehangover> just saying that there might be better solutions
[18:27:30] <Matiasu> I will check what happens if I add the code in a script tag, lets see if it prints the error
[18:27:36] <wookiehangover> require.js, yepnope, labjs
[18:27:55] <paupl> wookiehangover: thats the first solution that I found in jQuery
[18:28:02] <wookiehangover> all purpose-built tools for async / conditional script loading
[18:28:22] <wookiehangover> paupl: ya, $.getScript is a fine solution
[18:28:24] <paupl> I saw .load(); also, but getScript seemed to be more geared towards my purpose.
[18:28:33] <wookiehangover> that's fair
[18:29:20] <paupl> did you have another solution in mind?
[18:29:31] <paupl> what would be your default for dynamicly loading js files
[18:30:05] <Matiasu> yay!
[18:30:29] <Matiasu> I have a workaround!
[18:31:01] <paupl> ó¿ò
[18:31:06] <Matiasu> if you use instead of .getScript a .ajax request with dataType: html, and then a success handler like this: function(response) {eval(response);}
[18:31:10] <Matiasu> it prints the error :)
[18:31:27] <paupl> cool
[18:31:42] <adfasdfj> Anyone know how to get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/NWPDf/
[18:31:50] <Matiasu> the important thing is the dataType: 'html' instead of dataType: 'script'
[18:31:50] <adfasdfj> isotope plugin is having it's way with me..
[18:31:55] <paupl> i will give that a lash. thanks mate
[18:32:14] <adfasdfj> I suspect it's something to do with my scope
[18:32:22] <adfasdfj> But I'm a js/jquery nub, so...
[18:33:29] <Matiasu> internally, when you use dataType:script it should do an eval, I wonder why it works different o.o
[18:33:47] <adfasdfj> http://jsfiddle.net/NWPDf/3/
[18:39:04] <Matiasu> function(code) {eval.call(window, code);
[18:39:07] <Matiasu> }
[18:39:42] <Matiasu> it's a better idea, just to change the context in which it evaluates the code
[18:40:19] <Matiasu> (in case you want to try it, paupl)
[18:44:10] <paupl> Matiasu: im just having a go at the $.ajax solution now (i haven't got it working yet). But are saying its better to do it the way I was, but change where I am running it?
[18:44:53] <Matiasu> I just said it's better to use the code I told you instead of $.getScript
[18:45:23] <Matiasu> the code is:
[18:46:28] <Matiasu> $.ajax({ url: 'filename', dataType: 'html', success: function(code) {eval.call(window, code)}});
[18:48:27] <paupl> ah. thankyou.
[18:48:44] <paupl> ill have a got with that now.
[18:48:49] <paupl> go*
[18:49:32] <Matiasu> it's weird because it should be what it does internally, anyway, it now works fine for me :)
[18:51:50] <paupl> lol now it works in firefox but not IE
[18:57:19] <paupl> Sorry, had to restart browser
[18:57:35] <oojacoboo> how do you keep chrome from caching js on a refresh?
[18:57:45] <oojacoboo> I don't have issues with any other assets, just js
[18:58:41] <PastorBones> How can I auto scroll to the bottom of a div only when the scroll is already at the bottom? (for a chat app)
[18:59:11] <PastorBones> http://jsfiddle.net/NgdNz/ does not work
[18:59:13] <oojacoboo> PastorBones: if it's at the bottom, you don't need to scroll any further
[18:59:38] <PastorBones> yeah but I want to post a new message and only want it to scroll to bottom if it was already at the bottom
[18:59:53] <oojacoboo> wow, chrome requires "no-store" instead of "no-cache"
[18:59:54] <PastorBones> else it jumps to bottom if you're scrolled up tryin to read the logs when a new message comes in
[18:59:58] <oojacoboo> so much for spec
[19:00:02] <oojacoboo> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28035
[19:00:03] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: scroll it when you append the message
[19:00:26] <PastorBones> eddiemonge, already have it like that, but like I said ^ if you're not scrolled to the bottom trying to read the history...it jumps to the bottom
[19:01:01] <PastorBones> gets really annoying and the if statement in my jsfiddle does not work unless I use this for the element..I need to be able to use it by selector in my app
[19:02:11] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: no, i mean, var scrollpos = scroll position, append content, if scrollpos  === bottom, scroll
[19:03:23] <PastorBones> yeah and how do I get those values?
[19:03:41] <PastorBones> http://jsfiddle.net/NgdNz/ does not work
[19:03:55] <PastorBones> unless I change $('div.box') to this
[19:04:27] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: did you check the console for that?
[19:05:12] <eddiemonge> do you know what $('div.box') is? and why you cant use offsetHeight on it?
[19:05:49] <PastorBones> ok, so how do I select the scrollbar?
[19:06:43] <eddiemonge> "this" in that function refers to the $('div.box').  do you know how scope works in javascript?
[19:06:49] <eddiemonge> its ok to say no
[19:07:14] <eddiemonge> and you dont select the scrollbar. you get the scroll position
[19:08:28] <Bullterd> Morning All.
[19:08:38] <Bullterd> I'm using twitters bootstrap and jquery validate together
[19:08:54] <Bullterd> In order to make the HTML jquery validate generates to play nicley with bootstraps CSS
[19:09:08] <Bullterd> I have to follow this each time I call the JS to validate a form - https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/202
[19:09:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #202 on bootstrap, reported by Tornth (3m, 4w ago): Validator Plugin for Bootstrap
[19:09:29] <PastorBones> yes I know how scope works...my problem is getting offsetHeight when not is the scroll() function
[19:09:40] <Bullterd> Its some additional options that go together with the form fields in the validate command
[19:09:54] <Bullterd> The issue I have is that for each form I want to validate on my site, I have to include all the options
[19:10:14] <Bullterd> is there any way I can define these options the once, then any further jquery validate JS I use will use that setup by default?
[19:10:28] <MrGando> Hey guys, I have a question trying to load html using ajax, here's a gist https://gist.github.com/fffd2d5f4c8ef0ca7a26 , my var foo should hold the content of the "main-images" div… but holds nothing… any ideas ?
[19:11:48] <PastorBones> MrGando, your selector is wrong, shouldn't it be find('#main-images') ?
[19:12:30] <PastorBones> the # denotes it's an ID tag it's looking for, without that it's looking for the element <main-images>
[19:12:37] <MrGando> PastorBones: …. -_- , checking
[19:13:02] <MrGando> PastorBones: I changed it… same thing
[19:13:14] <fulcan> I have a script .js/init.js. that I am trying to call on from a directive in my layout.CSS and unsure of the syntax. I setup the action .<div id=.messages.. in my index.php and cannot figure out how to call on my .id=messages. from layout.css and initiate the init.js script?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531962/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531963/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531964/
[19:13:31] <fulcan> js/init.js script is just a simple fade script. I setup my id for the segment of code I want to perform this action on in my blah.php. The intelligent place to put the 'trigger' is in .css so that I can span the action in multiple places. Just can't find the proper syntax of how to 'call' or 'trigger' my 'id' class?
[19:13:45] <eddiemonge> MrGando: the returned data is already returning that node
[19:13:50] <MrGando> PastorBones: I updated the gist… https://gist.github.com/fffd2d5f4c8ef0ca7a26
[19:14:10] <MrGando> eddiemonge: I tried to do var foo = $(data).find('#main-images').html(); and the alert prints "null":
[19:14:40] <eddiemonge> MrGando: var foo = $(data); is what you want. and the alert is correct. foo is an object
[19:14:58] <someprimetime> is it generally better to separate multiple variable declarations with commas? or use var = blah; blah = foo;
[19:15:24] <someprimetime> var = blah; var = foo; for the above example
[19:15:43] <eddiemonge> i use commas
[19:18:03] <MrGando> eddiemonge: Ok, this is interesting… now I'm getting the html contained in <div id="learn-more"> in the alert… and not the html of the div in <div id="main-images"> … weird (updated gist https://gist.github.com/fffd2d5f4c8ef0ca7a26 )
[19:20:14] <eddiemonge> learn-more or learn-more-photo?
[19:23:39] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/NgdNz/3/
[19:25:22] <PastorBones> you're still referencing this though
[19:27:02] <PastorBones> oh wait, I see what you did thar
[19:28:11] <MrGando> eddiemonge: "learn-more"
[19:28:22] <eddiemonge> MrGando: are you sure? do you have a live example?
[19:29:03] <PastorBones> I haven't a clue how to apply it though lol http://jsfiddle.net/NgdNz/1/
[19:29:44] <eddiemonge> thats a different problem
[19:29:46] <MrGando> eddiemonge: I could send you my rather small website ( like 3 files haha , It's far easier than to make a jsfiddle )
[19:29:58] <dougb> Is there something special I need to do when I append an element to a page and then try to do something with $fn.click with it?
[19:30:14] <eddiemonge> im not fixing your whole site for you. unless im charging you. im just giving you ideas
[19:30:18] <dougb> I have it linked as a class
[19:30:35] <eddiemonge> dougb: you need to "delegate" it see ? delegate
[19:30:35] <bot-t1> dougb, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:30:46] <eddiemonge> and then if you are using jquery 1.7+ up see ? .on()
[19:30:47] <bot-t1> eddiemonge, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:31:11] <MrGando> eddiemonge: I didn't mean that, it's just an index + the css and the ajax html … but I understand. I'm sure that the alert is loading that though
[19:31:28] <dougb> eddiemonge: is that just a toggle?
[19:31:40] <oojacoboo> what attr do you guys use for repetitive triggers?
[19:32:11] <oojacoboo> so, if you're setting up an action that might be used 10x on one page, what attr value would you use for that element?
[19:32:22] <PastorBones> dougb, the .click() won't work as it doesn't 'see' it there, you have to bind the even to that newly added element using delegate or .on() (delegate is deprecated)
[19:32:42] <oojacoboo> I'd say a class, but that seems like a bad idea since that class might change with styling and you don't want to have to rewrite your js as well
[19:32:54] <coldhead> ARGH MY FUCKING SPINE
[19:32:58] <dougb> PastorBones: ok, thanks...i'll try it out
[19:33:32] <PastorBones> dougb: $('div.classname').on('click', function(e){ /* do stuff here */ })
[19:34:20] <eddiemonge> MrGando: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/NgdNz/4/
[19:34:56] <MrGando> eddiemonge: :P, what's that ?
[19:35:05] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: store the function as a var and then pass that var into the event handler
[19:35:29] <dougb> PastorBones: no, that didn't work.  errrg, it's not giving me any errors either which is frustrating.
[19:35:39] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I'm asking about the event handler
[19:35:42] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: delegate isnt deprecated. live is.
[19:35:49] <PastorBones> oh sorry :(
[19:35:50] <oojacoboo> and specifically in regards to the DOM html elements attr
[19:35:57] <abjorn> dodododo
[19:35:59] <fulcan> I have a script .js/init.js. that I am trying to call on from a directive in my layout.CSS (line 21) and unsure of the syntax. I setup the action '<div id='messages'' in my index.php (line 14) and cannot figure out how to call on my 'id=messages' from layout.css and initiate the init.js script?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531962/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531963/ http://paste.pocoo.org/show/531964/
[19:36:10] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: what does an event handler have to do with attributes?
[19:36:28] <MrGando> eddiemonge: hmmm, weird… if I just keep the <div id="main-images"> this is what happens: https://gist.github.com/fffd2d5f4c8ef0ca7a26
[19:36:28] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ dougb
[19:36:28] <bot-t1> dougb, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[19:36:39] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: well, just how I am listening to trigger the event
[19:36:51] <dougb> http://apps.db-dev.info/index.php/mlfm/create# click 'add element' then try to click 'remove' on the right hand side
[19:37:05] <da-beginner> how do i append another div AFTER a certain div? eg. appending div b so it becomes: <div id="a"></div><div id="b"></div>
[19:37:15] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: $('#element').on()
[19:37:31] <oojacoboo> like that, but I am saying, if I have 20 elements on the page, I'm not going to setup 20 ids
[19:37:40] <oojacoboo> what attr do you typically use for this?
[19:37:47] <eddiemonge> fulcan: wtf? what is line 21 in that css file? what do you mean "call on my 'id=message'"?
[19:38:20] <fulcan> eddiemonge div tag.
[19:38:20] <eddiemonge> ?insertafter @ da-beginner
[19:38:21] <bot-t1> da-beginner, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[19:38:35] <eddiemonge> fulcan: im not sure you grasp html/css/javascript
[19:39:00] <eddiemonge> fulcan: html defines your pages structure. css pretties it up. javascript operates on it to make things happen
[19:39:22] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: im still not getting what you are asking. can you make a demo please?
[19:39:36] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: this is not a demo question, it's a practice question
[19:39:43] <dougb> eddiemonge: i sent you the link a few minutes ago, if you have a chance to check it out that'd be awesome. thanks man
[19:39:53] <oojacoboo> what attribute do you use when you have 20 elements on a page that you need to assign the exact same event to
[19:40:17] <fulcan> eddiemonge I am pulling an example sraight out of the textbook but make 1 single change and that is calling on it from .css instaed of a seperate file. You'll have to talk to the author and not me.
[19:40:21] <oojacoboo> I don't understand why this question is so difficult
[19:40:35] <PastorBones> eddiemonge: thank you so much! You got me on the right track...I only had to remove the 'inbox' after the scroll (unless there is a more elegant way of doing it) http://jsfiddle.net/NgdNz/5/
[19:40:58] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: class
[19:41:01] <fulcan> eddiemonge so the simple answer is "css is not capable" of doing this?
[19:41:23] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I was saying earlier how that's a bad idea b/c it's most commonly tied with styling and is subject to change more frequently
[19:41:33] <oojacoboo> therefore, you're js would have to be updated as well
[19:41:38] <oojacoboo> so in practice, that's a bad idea
[19:41:41] <eddiemonge> dougb: yeah you need to "delegate" the event
[19:42:02] <dougb> ok, i tried 'on'...i'll see if delegate works though
[19:42:05] <eddiemonge> fulcan: please tell me its not that free html5 book going around
[19:42:13] <abjorn> some need to make the movie How To Train A Dragonite
[19:42:16] <eddiemonge> fulcan: and text books arent always correct or accurate
[19:42:26] <fulcan> eddiemonge I am on the jquery website.
[19:42:50] <fulcan> eddiemonge so the simple answer is "css is not capable" of doing this?
[19:42:53] <oojacoboo> dougb: you need 1.7+ for .on()
[19:43:07] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: honestly, my way is kind of janky to begin with but yeah what you did is right for the janky way
[19:43:23] <eddiemonge> fulcan: i dont know what you are trying to make css do
[19:43:37] <eddiemonge> fulcan: where/what on which jquery website?
[19:44:06] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: not really. thats what classes are intended for, tying groups of dom elements together
[19:44:09] <PastorBones> lol @ janky, what works works but would love to learn the elegant way if ya got a link or something
[19:44:27] <fulcan> eddiemonge make a nav-button do a simple 'fade in' using jquery and possibly css.
[19:44:40] <eddiemonge> PastorBones: that was the first solution that came to mind after a long day of already lots of coding and frying my brain
[19:44:49] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yes, so, you recommend tying events to classes when they are subject to change with styling?
[19:44:57] <PastorBones> no worries, I appreciate your janky effort :P
[19:44:58] <PastorBones> God bless
[19:44:59] <oojacoboo> in practice, I've found that to be a real PITA
[19:45:03] <eddiemonge> ajpiano or coldhead or someone far smarter might have a better idea
[19:45:27] <coldhead> wtf eddiemonge it's my first day -_-
[19:45:28] <kborchers> oojacoboo: use a class. don't apply any styles to it. only use it for selection
[19:45:45] <oojacoboo> kborchers: you say to use a custom "javascript" calss
[19:45:51] <oojacoboo> in addition to the styling classes
[19:45:54] <coldhead> class*
[19:45:59] <oojacoboo> class* thanks
[19:46:05] <eddiemonge> fulcan: ok. css styles the elements. it has nothing to do with the javascript.  you use javascript ( in a .js file) to do something like $(ele).fadeIn()
[19:46:17] <eddiemonge> fulcan: read the getting started guide see ? getting started
[19:46:18] <bot-t1> fulcan, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[19:46:24] <abjorn> >ask coldhead for help
[19:46:24] <abjorn> Hah
[19:46:33] <oojacoboo> kborchers: that doesn't make things clear when working between teams of people for knowing what is used for what
[19:46:42] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: they shouldnt change with styling. the html markup shouldnt change to accomodate the css. not really anyway
[19:47:16] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: words change in an evolving application and if your class names don't change with it, you're left with WTF later when you look at the html
[19:47:25] <oojacoboo> semantics makes things less painful
[19:47:28] <abjorn> sup coldhead
[19:48:04] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: you shouldnt be changing your html classes to match your css. mark up you page so it validates, looks good from a code perspective and then style that resulting markup in css
[19:48:19] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: you misread what I said
[19:48:25] <eddiemonge> if you need to add additional elements to help with styling css then thats fine
[19:48:33] <oojacoboo> so it validates ??
[19:48:37] <oojacoboo> what does that have to do with this
[19:48:44] <eddiemonge> im a firm believer in valide code
[19:48:51] <eddiemonge> and throw it in whenever i can to remind people
[19:48:56] <oojacoboo> ok, well, that's not related
[19:49:01] <oojacoboo> and I don't care about it
[19:49:03] <coldhead> hi abjsy
[19:49:07] <eddiemonge> but the main thing is you ignored what i said
[19:49:19] <abjorn> watsgoinon
[19:49:26] <eddiemonge> you dont start making a website by writing all the css and then writing the html do you?
[19:49:32] <abjorn> yes
[19:49:33] <abjorn> I do
[19:49:45] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: you're talking about oranges man, I'm talking about granny smiths
[19:49:52] <eddiemonge> abjorn: your opinion is like coldhead's. its a cows point
[19:49:59] <abjorn> hey
[19:50:06] <abjorn> I've been doin jqueries since 1996
[19:50:14] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: no im talking about oranges. you are talking about the orange peel color
[19:50:25] <abjorn> WHAT IS THIS CONVERSATION EVEN ABOUT
[19:50:34] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: is trolling me i think
[19:50:42] <abjorn> everyone is trolling everyone!
[19:50:46] <abjorn> it's like 4chan!
[19:50:46] <oojacoboo> if you have multiple elements on a page tied to an event, what attr do you use?
[19:51:19] <oojacoboo> I say, class is a bad idea b/c it's most commonly tied to your styling and you shouldn't have to update your js when you update styling as well
[19:51:41] <oojacoboo> and yes, classes change when styling changes, but not b/c of styling, b/c of other reasons
[19:51:51] <oojacoboo> they just follow suit many times, for semantic reasons
[19:52:10] <abjorn> I'm not sure if either of you know what you're talking about anymore.
[19:52:18] <eddiemonge> if you are updating your css/html, whats one more change in the js?
[19:52:21] <oojacoboo> but I didn't know if others use things like alt or rel or a cusotm attr or what
[19:52:36] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: it's just that, one more change
[19:53:01] <abjorn> coldhead I demand to know what you've made take place here
[19:53:15] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: but if the person working with the styling makes and update and doesn't realize that events are based on it, it can break functionality
[19:53:17] <eddiemonge> i like to use <a data-my-own-custom-class-to-use-instead-of-just-using-classes-because-i-like-to-be-less-performant-that-way="myclass">Tag</a>
[19:53:20] <oojacoboo> I think it's safer to use a custom attr
[19:53:52] <eddiemonge> $('[data-my-own-custom-class-to-use-instead-of-just-using-classes-because-i-like-to-be-less-performant-that-way="myclass"'].on()
[19:53:56] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:53:59] <eddiemonge> ?boom
[19:53:59] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[19:54:05] <eddiemonge> coldhead: like that?
[19:54:27] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: that is what I am saying though
[19:54:35] <abjorn> bot-t1: BUT WHO WAS PHONE?
[19:54:35] <bot-t1> abjorn, Signs point to yes.
[19:54:38] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: if the person working on styling makes changes and doesnt check/notify other teams, you have bigger issues going on
[19:54:42] <coldhead> PERFORMANT IS NOT A REAL WORD
[19:54:54] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: that requires someone to monitor every edit, that's silly
[19:54:58] <coldhead> I KILL ALL OF YOU
[19:55:14] <abjorn> IT IS NOW
[19:55:16] <abjorn> LANGUAGES EVOLVE
[19:55:18] <eddiemonge> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/performant
[19:55:20] <abjorn> IT'S BECOME A REAL WORD
[19:55:24] <abjorn> JUST LIKE GOOGLE BECAME A WORD
[19:55:25] <coldhead> that's not a word we need
[19:55:38] <abjorn> hey it's better than saying "this performs well"
[19:55:40] <abjorn> I mean its like
[19:55:46] <dougb> oojacoboo: eddiemonge thanks guys, delegate worked! i tried .on but it didn't work even though i'm loading 1.7.1
[19:55:48] <abjorn> a whole 2 characters differences
[19:55:55] <abjorn> can has my 2chars
[19:55:58] <coldhead> when you say "perfomant" you are saying "i hate the english language and i intend to join an extremist terrorist cell"
[19:56:04] <abjorn> my char[2]
[19:56:29] <abjorn> well...I've seen bigger jumps in logic than that I suppose, coldhead
[19:56:34] <coldhead> read a book sometime, abjorn
[19:56:37] <coldhead> you'd be surprised
[19:56:47] <eddiemonge> dougb: did you get the syntax right? its very similiar to delegate but backwards
[19:56:48] <abjorn> I read books
[19:56:51] <abjorn> when the mood strikes me
[19:57:12] <eddiemonge> coldhead: i dont speak english. i speak american.
[19:57:17] <coldhead> even that stupid wikitionary entry says "(jargon, chiefly computing) "
[19:57:23] <coldhead> AKA "friendless losers"
[19:57:30] <abjorn> AKA "coldhead"
[19:57:37] <coldhead> too timid to even masturbate in church
[19:57:51] <abjorn> I'm not too timid for that.
[19:58:11] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: no, that requires a "hey is it ok to make a structural change to this html for no good reason?" shout to the other teams
[19:58:33] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I'd prefer to eliminate that communication and double checking
[19:58:35] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: i mean your db person wouldnt change a tablename and not check/notify other people would they?
[19:58:42] <coldhead> look it's a free world and all and yes language evolves and look at what happened to discrete and discreet BUT AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR TO ME please don't use performant and as a personal favour to you i won't break every finger on your mastubation hand
[19:58:43] <abjorn> I would.
[19:58:44] <eddiemonge> its the same thing
[19:59:07] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: it depends really, we run a small team
[19:59:08] <abjorn> >favour
[19:59:13] <abjorn> just for that coldhead
[19:59:17] <abjorn> I will say performant
[19:59:20] <oojacoboo> any bullshit back and forth that can be cut, should
[19:59:21] <abjorn> even when it makes no sense
[20:00:36] <abjorn> coldhead I will performant all over your face
[20:01:04] <gf3> abjorn: too soon, bro
[20:01:14] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: like this performant discussion on why people who should be using classes, want to make up an attribute that will be slower?
[20:01:19] <gf3> abjorn: coldhead just had face surgery...
[20:01:27] <abjorn> I like to be edgy
[20:01:29] <dougb> eddiemonge: that's probably where i went wrong :)
[20:01:38] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: classes aren't indexed, last I checked
[20:01:43] <gf3> abjorn: :-/
[20:01:52] <coldhead> :%|
[20:01:57] <coldhead> that's the surgery
[20:02:14] <abjorn> I'm like every comic at a comedy central roast, edgy is the only way I can be funny.
[20:03:00] <dougb> i changed it to .on, i figure i don't want to get stuck with a depreciated function
[20:03:16] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: do a jsperf on $('.class') vs $('[class]
[20:03:29] <Guddu> Dear all.....What is the best way to show the current time on my Web Application page? I would like the time to keep increasing by seconds.....
[20:03:32] <abjorn> hey now, it's not technically deprecated if you use an old version!
[20:03:39] <gf3> dougb: nothing in jQuery ever gets deprecated, ever
[20:03:49] <eddiemonge> dougb: delegate isnt deprecated but .on() is the preferred method so ... umm .... yeah. good for you
[20:03:50] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: and data()?
[20:04:03] <dougb> oh
[20:04:12] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: sure why not, but what are you going to use as your selector for data? you going to do a for loop?
[20:05:03] <abjorn> coldhead: I hear that surgery is all the rage in hollywood
[20:05:27] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: mmm true
[20:06:10] <coldhead> Guddu: http://www.ajaxupdates.com/jclock-jquery-clock-plugin/
[20:06:19] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: is the performance on the class selector really much better than the attr selector?
[20:06:21] <coldhead> something like that or any of the hundred other clock plugins
[20:08:00] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: yes. a lot
[20:08:21] <eddiemonge> especially in browsers that support getElementsByClassname or whatever that one is
[20:08:47] <oojacoboo> yea
[20:08:57] <abjorn> man all the ORM modules in the npm registry suck
[20:09:37] <coldhead> ?mlm
[20:09:38] <bot-t1> much like myself

[20:09:59] <oojacoboo> maybe something like custom classes for js with a different format :/
[20:10:00] <abjorn> no "much like yourself"
[20:10:03] <coldhead> i like boxxy, Patabugen, because it's easy to use and the name reminds me of boxy
[20:10:21] <abjorn> ?
[20:10:24] <coldhead> wait, the plugin is boxy, the person is boxxy
[20:10:28] <abjorn> lol
[20:10:29] <abjorn> was

[20:11:01] <coldhead> ?muu
[20:11:01] <bot-t1> much unlike urself
[20:11:06] <abjorn> god why
[20:11:13] <coldhead> ?mlmlm
[20:11:13] <bot-t1> much like multi-level marketing
[20:11:22] <abjorn> WHY DOES THIS ALL EXIST
[20:11:30] <abjorn> also lol multi-level marketing
[20:11:33] <coldhead> because sometimes they're needed
[20:11:36] <abjorn> aka 50% of hostgator customers
[20:11:36] <coldhead> ?fweep
[20:11:37] <bot-t1> coldhead, THOO! PAF
[20:11:48] <abjorn> but
[20:11:54] <abjorn> much like multi-level marketing?
[20:11:58] <abjorn> thats so....specific
[20:12:13] <coldhead> time and place, abjorn, time and place
[20:12:28] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: you really are making this harder than it needs to be and if you dont use classes you are going to be creating more work for yourself
[20:12:47] <abjorn> If I had a nickel for every multi-level marketing or similar scam site we had running on HostGator I'd be as rich as they claim they'll make me.
[20:12:54] <abjorn> *have
[20:13:45] <Patabugen> Thanks coldhead, Boxy looks nice!
[20:14:37] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yea, I see that classes is nice, but I HATE the idea of sharing the same class with styling
[20:14:58] <oojacoboo> I've seen the issues it's created
[20:15:01] <coldhead> i need to get in on that, abjorn
[20:15:07] <oojacoboo> and it bothers me that there isn't more structure to it as well
[20:15:07] <coldhead> i just spend my money
[20:15:11] <coldhead> i should be investing it
[20:15:17] <coldhead> in dot coms
[20:15:23] <abjorn> yeah, go invest your money in multi-level marketing
[20:15:27] <engaged> i have some divs like <div class="box" num="1"></div>   <div class="box" num="2"></div>
[20:15:34] <engaged> is there a way to modify something if all i know is the num?
[20:15:50] <oojacoboo> engaged: yes
[20:15:55] <engaged> how?
[20:16:01] <oojacoboo> just select the one with the attr num  = 1
[20:16:24] <engaged> $(".box").attr("num":1) or how?
[20:16:27] <coldhead> abjorn: i'm going to invest in these guys: http://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=JBH.AX#symbol=jbh.ax;range=3m;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=;
[20:16:38] <oojacoboo> if == 1 engaged
[20:16:42] <coldhead> sell high buy cheap
[20:16:47] <Patabugen> Ah coldhead I can't download it because the plugins site is down and they've listed no mirrors. Any chance you can send me a copy?

[20:25:48] <abjorn> I want this month to go by so I can start flex hours
[20:44:46] <rocketman> I am trying to change the rel attribute on my page with jquery. I want to apply a "rel=expand[thumb1]" to a link when it is clicked and and a rel=collapse[thumb1] to the link when another link is clicked. Does anyone know how to do this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14080718/Final/UITabs11.html
[20:45:17] <rocketman> I am very new to Jquery and not sure to make things work.
[20:48:15] <anchovy> ?attr @ rocketman
[20:48:16] <bot-t1> rocketman, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[20:50:18] <DofLeFou> it sounds as if handleError was deprecated. Does that make ajax file upload a defunct plugin, or is there some method of updating it to handle errors in a valid way?
[20:50:40] <DofLeFou> i kept getting ….Result of expression '$.handleError' [undefined] is not a function
[20:52:02] <rocketman> member:bot-t1- can you send me a sample? I have been trying to write this to relplace rel and I can seem to get it to work
[20:55:06] <anchovy> rocketman, $obj.attr('rel','expand\\[thumb1\\]')
[20:55:17] <anchovy> I believe you need to double escape the square brackets
[20:56:21] <coldhead> and watch the waves and move the faders
[20:57:37] <anchovy> gillian
[20:57:47] <coldhead> hey well spotted :)
[20:57:58] <anchovy> thanks google
[20:58:05] <coldhead> d'oh
[20:58:09] <anchovy> :)
[20:58:47] <anchovy> ?g and watch the waves and move the faders

[20:58:55] <anchovy> hey it still works
[20:59:45] <anchovy> ok that's enough bot abuse for the night, I'm going to bed.
[21:00:04] <rocketman> Ill give that a try. Thanks anchovy!
[21:00:04] <coldhead> goodnight!
[21:01:50] <Naimish> Hi Guys
[21:02:16] <Naimish> I need help
[21:02:45] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[21:02:55] <Naimish> how to stop jquery image slider on mouserhover
[21:03:31] <coldhead> is there anything about a pause() or stop() method in its docs?
[21:04:07] <Naimish> i just use 	$('.gallery').mouseover(function(){
[21:04:07] <Naimish> 					$(this).stop();
[21:04:07] <Naimish> 				});
[21:04:17] <fulcan> can someone point out what I am doing wrong?   http://pastebin.com/G1Q0SZEs   script -->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/533207/
[21:04:18] <Naimish> but it is not doing anything
[21:05:25] <coldhead> that's jQuery's stop()
[21:05:56] <coldhead> you need a reference to the gallery object and you need to call stop or pause on that
[21:05:59] <coldhead> assuming it has one
[21:09:28] <fulcan> can someone take a look and tell me why my 'fade' would fail?  No errors but I am pulling the info in from a nav.inc.php file, but this should effect it?   http://pastebin.com/G1Q0SZEs   script -->  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/533207/
[21:12:49] <fulcan> ?
[21:12:54] <coldhead> that looks okay to me, fulcan
[21:13:01] <coldhead> can you verify the script is running at all
[21:13:07] <coldhead> with alert('lol aids') or something?
[21:14:14] <fulcan> coldhead I am a little bit new to jquery, running through my first couple of test scripts. I am not familiar with 'lol aids'?
[21:14:45] <fulcan> coldhead inside my script as part of my function?
[21:15:29] <coldhead> inside the document ready, fulcan
[21:15:33] <coldhead> where the fade is
[21:15:50] <coldhead> so you can verify whether the javascript is even being run
[21:15:57] <coldhead> you don't have to use "lol aids"
[21:16:04] <coldhead> that's just an example
[21:16:10] <coldhead> alert('lorem ipsum')
[21:23:57] <fulcan> coldhead the script is running I was able to acheive an alert on the page. Thanks for the new debugging tool too. but fade doesn't work. ??  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/533210/
[21:24:45] <bobby> $(document).ready(function()  { 	alert('lorem ipsum'); 	$('#message').fadeIn('slow'); } );
[21:25:27] <fulcan> yup, that's my code.  :)
[21:27:48] <coldhead> fulcan: do you have firebug or chrome web inspector?
[21:28:32] <abjorn> coldhead: https://github.com/Abjorn/dolphin fuck these shitty ORM's, I'm makan my own
[21:29:15] <coldhead> hey good luck with that!
[21:29:20] <coldhead> you've got some guys, kid
[21:29:23] <coldhead> guts8
[21:29:26] <coldhead> er close enough
[21:29:27] <abjorn> I've got some guys
[21:29:36] <abjorn> guts? whys it take guts?
[21:29:52] <bobby> hai
[21:29:54] <bobby> gugs
[21:30:02] <bobby> what up
[21:30:07] <coldhead> ORM! it's ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE
[21:30:11] <abjorn> naw
[21:30:13] <coldhead> DONALD KNUTH
[21:30:15] <bobby> ok....
[21:30:57] <abjorn> ORM is.........the M in MVC....hardly on the level of DOONAALD KNUUTHH
[21:31:18] <coldhead> bot-t: tell bobby i will never forget you
[21:31:19] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[21:31:33] <Patabugen> Hey, does anyone know how I can create an iframe and set the entire contents of it (including the head)? I'm finding many examples for manipulatin the body but have had no luck setting the entire data
[21:33:43] <fulcan> coldhead http://pastebin.com/E7yDRfcz  nothing chome or inspector on my puter and fade fails on IE or firefox but another script works fine but as soon as I try to write a script that calls on a div tag it craps. permission should be fine.
[21:33:54] <Naimish> Hi Guys
[21:34:06] <Naimish>  $('.scrollbox').hover(function() {
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	$(this).stop();
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	}, function() {
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     		$(this).animate({
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	        right: movement
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	    }, 1000, function() {
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	            c++;
[21:34:07] <Naimish>     	         $($('.t-item')[c-2]).clone().appendTo('.scrollbox');
[21:34:08] <Naimish>     	         $($('.t-item')[c-2]).empty().html('.');
[21:34:08] <Naimish>     	         i++;
[21:34:09] <Naimish>     	        setTimeout("scroll_boxes()",5000);
[21:34:09] <Naimish>     	    });
[21:34:10] <Naimish>     		
[21:34:10] <Naimish>        });
[21:34:12] <Naimish> is this correct
[21:34:36] <Naimish>  it is not functioning correctly
[21:34:45] <Patabugen> Naimish you should use a paste bin for that much code
[21:34:50] <GranMal>  Naimish: Don't paste code into the channel
[21:34:55] <Naimish> ok
[21:34:56] <GranMal> use pastie or gist
[21:36:39] <Naimish> hi guys
[21:36:40] <Naimish> http://pastebin.com/maC0bt2r
[21:36:54] <Naimish> could you please check
[21:37:08] <Naimish> I want to stop animation on hover
[21:38:32] <coldhead> fulcan: does it work better if you load jquery before your init.js?
[21:42:47] <slide> that looks like a lot of bots
[21:43:50] <fulcan> coldhead http://pastebin.com/kWHHBRFJ   nope   :(
[21:44:47] <coldhead> you maybe wanna install firebug, fulcan
[21:45:12] <coldhead> that will let you run code in the page once it's loaded
[21:45:19] <coldhead> so you can see if it works
[21:46:40] <fulcan> coldhead I am accessing the code via the command line and prefer not to install anything on my workstation.
[21:47:04] <fulcan> coldhead is that a server side application?
[21:47:32] <Naimish> hi guys could u please help me with http://pastebin.com/maC0bt2r
[21:48:56] <coldhead> it's a firefox plugin, fulcan
[21:49:03] <coldhead> will save years of your life
[21:52:45] <fulcan> coldhead http://paste.pocoo.org/show/533213/  wow, this fails too.   :(  this is something else that a plugin won't fix.
[21:53:36] <coldhead> that still has init loading before jQuery
[21:53:41] <coldhead> reverse those two lines
[21:54:08] <coldhead> firebug is a debugger, so it is actually quite good at finding bugs
[21:56:03] <BinaryKitten> you're up early remy
[21:58:24] <coldhead> it's irccloud, BinaryKitten, it's parting and joining fiercely
[21:58:36] <BinaryKitten> bah
[21:58:41] <coldhead> bah indeed
[21:58:54] * BinaryKitten has had lots of issues with sleep
[21:58:55] <fulcan> coldhead  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/533215/  same  :(   and tried various ../   incase the calling directory structure was incorrect. I can get a 'same page' query to work but it fails when trying to access an outside script for some reason?
[22:01:34] <coldhead> i'm not sure what you mean by outside the page but that sounds like it could be the problem fulcan
[22:01:55] <coldhead> sorry to hear that, BinaryKitten, did you try sleepy tea?
[22:02:02] <BinaryKitten> a few things
[22:02:12] <coldhead> http://t2tea.com/shop-for-tea/tea-bags/sleep-tight/?v=1
[22:02:17] <BinaryKitten> ended up plowing though some work
[22:02:30] <coldhead> you champ
[22:02:42] <coldhead> much better than plowing through some heroin
[22:03:11] <fulcan> coldhead calling on an outside script should be a basic function of jquery.
[22:03:55] <coldhead> it may well be, i just don't know what you mean by that
[22:04:09] <fulcan> I cannot imagine why 'src="/js/jquery.js"' would fail. I tried src="../js/jquery.js"
[22:04:27] <coldhead> fulcan: try alert(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[22:04:35] <coldhead> that will alert the jQuery version if it's loaded
[22:04:38] <coldhead> or error if it isn't
[22:04:40] <fulcan> I cannot imagine why 'src="/js/init.js"' would fail. I tried src="../js/init.js"
[22:04:48] <fulcan> I meant
[22:05:15] <fulcan> coldhead outside script
[22:05:25] <prs> Hi
[22:05:58] <coldhead> if scripta.js is loaded then scriptb.js can call functions in scripta.js, if those functions are global
[22:06:17] <coldhead> and where scripta.js is jquery then yes, scriptb.js can use jQuery
[22:07:20] <prs> I've got a function that loads a datatable – which is exactly that, and html table with some data – and I would like to then replace all entries in first column with some string. Like "Foobar". This is what i came up with so far: http://wklej.org/id/665889/
[22:07:29] <prs> and clearly – it doesn't work.
[22:07:38] <prs> my question is – why? and how to make it work?
[22:08:29] <dytrivedi> wat is jquary can you pleas eksplain?
[22:08:31] <coldhead> :first will only work on the very first td
[22:08:42] <coldhead> ?:nth-child @ prs
[22:08:43] <bot-t> prs, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[22:09:00] <coldhead> .find('td:nth-child(0)') is probably better
[22:09:00] <prs> coldhead: ok. will try that.
[22:09:25] <coldhead> it's some french thing, dytrivedi
[22:09:32] <coldhead> you don't need to know ya big yahoo
[22:09:40] <prs> coldhead: well.... it doesn't seem to change anything.
[22:09:44] <dytrivedi> ahwaha
[22:10:22] <prs> coldhead: maybe it's a timing problem – like it try to replace it, but it's not loaded yet, and when it's loaded it already thinks that column was replaced?
[22:12:14] <kborchers> prs: without seeing your markup, if #datatable is a table that is your problem because your are trying to select a table inside of that element.
[22:12:33] <Naimish> hi guys could help me please
[22:12:44] <dytrivedi> Naimish: shure
[22:12:44] <Naimish> http://pastebin.com/maC0bt2r
[22:12:48] <dytrivedi> you from India, my man?
[22:12:53] <Naimish> yes
[22:13:27] <Naimish> I want to stop animation at hover
[22:13:55] <prs> kborchers: http://wklej.org/id/665890/ « thats the template for the markup. (in django templates)
[22:14:53] <Naimish> any help?
[22:14:53] <dytrivedi> Naimish: did you try using .stop(true)?
[22:14:54] <kborchers> prs: so where in that template is an element with the id of datatable?
[22:15:02] <prs> kborchers: around it.
[22:15:09] <dytrivedi> Naimish: also, you can do art of living course. That'll improve your coads.
[22:15:15] <Naimish> this is about wordpress post slider
[22:15:17] <dytrivedi> Or a landmark forum
[22:15:22] <dytrivedi> oh ok
[22:15:28] <prs> kborchers: thats the content that's being loaded to <div id="datatable">
[22:15:38] <dytrivedi> I don't know if these courses will help then
[22:15:42] <Naimish> it slide thorugh right
[22:15:55] <Naimish> no I will try that
[22:16:08] <dytrivedi> DID YOU HEAR WORDPRESS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING?
[22:16:19] <Naimish> no
[22:16:29] <dytrivedi> aww man
[22:17:38] <Naimish> can you please check now
[22:17:43] <Naimish> the full function
[22:17:46] <dytrivedi> how?
[22:17:53] <Naimish> in http://pastebin.com/maC0bt2r
[22:18:19] <dytrivedi> oh nice
[22:18:51] <frown_roller> hi, where would I post about a bug in ui themeroller?
[22:19:03] <kborchers> prs: assuming only one table, $("#datatable tr").each(function(){$(this).children().eq(0).html("foobar");});
[22:19:31] <dytrivedi> Naimish: have you heard of setInterval?
[22:19:39] <Naimish> yes
[22:19:47] <dytrivedi> oh good
[22:20:00] <coldhead> i've heard of it too
[22:20:29] <dytrivedi> coldhead: it is your first day, though
[22:20:30] <Naimish> I am not very good with jquery
[22:20:39] <dytrivedi> Naimish: well
[22:20:42] <dytrivedi> Nobody of us are
[22:20:50] <dytrivedi> except a david mark
[22:21:02] <dytrivedi> coldhead is figuring it out
[22:21:11] <dytrivedi> I'm figuring out what coldhead is figuring out
[22:21:11] <Naimish> but I think it is very small thing to stop slider on hover
[22:21:23] <dytrivedi> yeah it is
[22:21:32] <dytrivedi> IF YOU STRUCTURE YOUR COADS IN A BETTER WAY
[22:21:36] <dytrivedi> use setinterval, dawg
[22:21:40] <frown_roller> kborchers: $("#datatable tr > :first-child").html("foobar");
[22:21:55] <Naimish> http://cpa.hostbooyah.com/~devcaree/
[22:22:09] <dytrivedi> booyah!
[22:22:14] <dytrivedi> is it SFW?
[22:22:25] <dytrivedi> or does it have lolcats?
[22:22:31] <Naimish> this is the site and I want to stop latest news on hover
[22:22:57] <dytrivedi> you'll not believe but I'm listening to Justin Bieber now
[22:23:03] <dytrivedi> so I'm going to kill myself
[22:23:15] <Naimish> hmm
[22:23:30] <dytrivedi> ?scrollable @ Naimish
[22:23:31] <bot-t> Naimish, .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[22:23:39] <dytrivedi> ?g scrollable @ Naimish
[22:23:40] <bot-t> Naimish, jQuery Scrollable @ jQuery Tools - Scroll your HTML with eye candy - http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/
[22:23:43] <coldhead> Naimish: are you using the nivo image slider?
[22:24:03] <coldhead> $('#slider').data('nivoslider').stop();
[22:24:04] <Naimish> no
[22:24:08] <coldhead> oh
[22:24:10] <coldhead> sorry
[22:24:14] <coldhead> it's just that you never said
[22:24:19] <coldhead> so i am having to guess and imagine
[22:24:40] <Naimish> it is custom based animation
[22:24:44] <dytrivedi> coldhead: no he's reinventing the wheel
[22:24:49] <coldhead> ah, i see
[22:24:53] <coldhead> well that's good
[22:24:57] <dytrivedi> Naimish: use scrollable plugin, son
[22:24:59] <coldhead> because there aren't enough slider plugins
[22:25:02] <dytrivedi> Your prayers will be heard
[22:25:06] <dytrivedi> Amen
[22:25:07] <coldhead> it will be good to have more
[22:25:21] <coldhead> guys i am taking a bus tonight
[22:25:26] <coldhead> to an indian restaurant
[22:25:28] <Naimish> can you help in news slider
[22:25:31] <coldhead> i will be thinking of my indian brothers
[22:25:35] <coldhead> and sisters
[22:25:37] <dytrivedi> hahaha
[22:25:42] <Naimish> hahah
[22:25:49] <coldhead> i feel that that's the most helpful i can be right now
[22:25:49] <Naimish> c'mon guys
[22:26:00] <dytrivedi> Naimish: like I said, use scrollable plugin
[22:26:08] <dytrivedi> it'll solve your problems
[22:26:24] <Naimish> ok
[22:26:25] <dytrivedi> excluding premature ejaculation
[22:27:05] <coldhead> ew
[22:31:20] <fulcan> if I have a background image that is set and called in to my homepage via css, how do I make it fade? writing jquery is pretty straight forward on a .php page but .css must be different?
[22:32:08] <dytrivedi> .seen iszak
[22:32:11] <hsbot> iszak was seen 13 hours, 1 minute and 59 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Iszak
[22:32:53] <dytrivedi> fulcan: so is your situation warranting to write jquery in a .css file?
[22:33:20] <fulcan> dytrivedi just curious how to do it.
[22:33:25] <dytrivedi> oh okay
[22:33:30] <dytrivedi> I'm curious as well
[22:33:46] <frown_roller> @fulcan, you can only fade the element the background image is set on
[22:34:08] <mindis|work> you can fake the background though by using position:absolute and such
[22:37:17] <fulcan> frown_roller like setting the fading a block element vs an inline element?
[22:38:45] <enerel> hi guys
[22:38:58] <enerel> some jquery are not working on FF9?
[22:39:40] <mindis|work> for example...?
[22:40:31] <enerel> could not work jframe
[22:40:38] <enerel> http://garage.pimentech.net/scripts_doc_jquery_jframe/
[22:42:15] <mindis|work> i don't see any different results on chrome or FF9
[22:42:26] <mindis|work> in their sample that is
[22:46:14] <innociv_> I wonder if I can animate +=45 with rotate :|
[22:48:42] <LazyTown> how can I fire an even after the ajax has loaded on a ui tabs page?
[22:55:39] <prs> kborchers: thanks, that worked.
[22:57:01] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/5EydR/ What gives? :/ http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2009/08/07/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale.html
[23:02:47] <codeclarified> innociv_: you need his earlier js patch, http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2009/02/22/jquery-patch-css-transform.html for the other script to run
[23:03:02] <innociv_> I have that in the jsfiddle.
[23:03:39] <innociv_> Oh I didn't
[23:03:42] <innociv_> But a different error
[23:04:00] <codeclarified> http://jsfiddle.net/BdEVF/
[23:04:30] <codeclarified> thing is, text is left aligned, and a block element, rotated on center.... your text is now sitting somewhere behind the CSS panel (or cut off by overflow)
[23:04:55] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/5EydR/2/ Wtf ? It seems to work without minified
[23:05:34] <innociv_> Why is minifying it breaking it? :\
[23:09:21] <dytrivedi> innociv_: which minifier do you use?
[23:09:35] <mehrdad_> plleeeeeeeeeeassse
[23:09:36] <innociv_> http://jscompress.com/

[23:14:10] <dytrivedi> this might help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4128247/prototype-chaining-in-javascript
[23:14:22] <mehrdad_> lemme see
[23:14:56] <mehrdad_> while im reading it, let me say JS‌ is such a ugly ass language :(
[23:15:57] <innociv_> Just minifying, no obfuscation, has it not working :\
[23:16:03] <mehrdad_> how do u cast an object in jquery?
[23:16:08] <mehrdad_> maybe it would work for me
[23:17:19] <mehrdad_> Date.prototype._getFullYear = Date.prototype.getFullYear;
[23:17:28] <mehrdad_> how do i access the Date proto?
[23:17:32] <mehrdad_> not the underline one
[23:17:40] <innociv_> Nevermind
[23:25:19] <mehrdad_> anything like this in jquery?‌var d=(Date) obj;
[23:30:29] <aro> is there a way to link to certain tabs?
[23:30:34] <aro> with jquery ui tabs
[23:31:04] <thinced> what do you mean by linking?
[23:31:38] <innociv_> How do I check if( -50 <= -35 ) ?
[23:31:52] <innociv_> Hm. Make it a stringI guess
[23:32:18] <aro> well, like say i have a page with 4 tabs, id like to link to that page and open a specific tab
[23:32:39] <aro> server.com/page#tab3
[23:32:43] <aro> something like that
[23:36:23] <mehrdad_> what does this mean?‌(function($) {
[23:36:38] <mehrdad_> is it a sign of override or something?
[23:37:22] <codeclarified> aro: if you're using jquery ui tabs that should be default, the hashtag is the id of the tab content you want to display (not the id of the tab link)
[23:38:05] <sj26> mehrdad_: function($) { ... } is an anonymous function with one argument, $. The common jQuery idiom is (function($) { ... })(jQuery); which creates a function which turns jQuery into $ and runs the function to create an anonymous scope
[23:38:06] <mehrdad_> how do i write a function in a object that overrides some other obj's methods, that returns its parent ref?
[23:38:25] <thinced> aro, exactly :)
[23:38:31] <mehrdad_> sj26, thx
[23:39:22] <aro> i want them bookmarkable
[23:39:28] <mehrdad_> and sj26  can u answer my second question plz?
[23:39:43] <codeclarified> you can bookmark a url with a hashtag...
[23:40:08] <aro> right, but when you click a tab it doesnt update the URL
[23:40:31] <codeclarified> because you don't reload the page
[23:40:43] <aro> it doesnt update the url with hash tag
[23:40:46] <aro> so its not bookmarkable
[23:40:48] <codeclarified> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#events
[23:41:28] <codeclarified> ahh sorry... i'm not thinkin "normal" bookmarking... I'm thinkin "why the hell don they just right click the link and bookmark from there"
[23:41:39] <aro> lol
[23:41:40] <aro> np
[23:41:41] <codeclarified> got what you're sayin
[23:41:44] <thinced> aro: You can use javascripts location.hash = 'tab-2' when clicking
[23:42:02] <sj26> mehrdad_: I don't understand your question. Are you asking how to use extend?
[23:42:50] <sj26> blah = {foo: 1}; $.extend({}, blah, {overridden: 2}) == {foo:1, overriden: 2} ?
[23:42:53] <mehrdad_> going to post it on pastebin
[23:42:57] <mehrdad_> w8 plz
[23:43:14] <thinced> aro: tuning it a bit: window.location.hash = 'tab-2';
[23:50:55] <heikki_> hello. i was unable to search from google since it seems to ignore the character # but anyhow... how do i check if the browser address bar has #something
[23:51:16] <heikki_> like example.com/sample.php#position
[23:52:38] <Planet_EN> can we do something like this?
[23:52:38] <Planet_EN> http://jsbin.com/ijuwoc/9/edit/#javascript
[23:53:17] <Planet_EN> seems not to be working, can we assign a property for building other properties
