[00:04:48] <noob13> hurray! i fixed it!
[00:05:19] <anisha> noob13, can you tell what you fixed??
[00:05:29] <nVee> hey guys. How can I get the array key for a value of that element? So if I know the value, and just need the key of that value?
[00:05:52] <anisha> nVee, indexOf
[00:06:16] <noob13> anisha: the ajax/json problem i was dealing with for a while there..
[00:06:27] <anisha> k
[00:06:33] <noob13> solidus-river: i don't understand what you want to do.
[00:07:48] <solidus-river> noob13: heres the situation, my solution right now is sub-optimal i think
[00:08:41] <solidus-river> noob13: i want to be able to add tags to a post on my site. I want to parse a tags field and box the things my parsing algorithm recognizes as unique tags in the string to indicate to the user that those are the tags that will be associated with this post
[00:08:54] <solidus-river> right now i'm parsing the string and creating boxes of tags recognized below the post
[00:08:57] <anli_> Anyone using fullcalendar here? I want to know how to not have drag event days described as a delta, but real dates
[00:09:27] <solidus-river> which in a way is good, as i can then add further description of the tags to the user such as how many other posts share that tag etc
[00:09:37] <solidus-river> but in a way its bad because information is duplicated and seperated on the page
[00:15:52] <noob13> solidus-river: hmm, i still don't understand the problem :)
[00:16:01] <noob13> what is wrong with the current way?
[00:16:18] <solidus-river> nothing, its jsut not as slick as i'd like :P i can definitely make due though
[00:16:22] <noob13> information is duplicated? like you might show the same tag twice?
[00:23:36] <luke_66> hi everyone
[00:37:18] <luke_66> i'm using the bxSlider plugin (a slider similar to jcarousel) on custom Magento store. While the slider is istantiated on documet.ready() by this way: http://dpaste.com/647363/, i want
[00:37:18] <luke_66> to change auto attribute to false in the php code if the slider items count is less than 5. i've tried to change it with: http://dpaste.com/648687/ but it doesn't work, so i'm not sure that
[00:37:18] <luke_66> attribute of objects instantiated on dom ready can be changed by this way. anybody could help?
[00:45:01] <JKarsrud> luke_66: you have a . between $ and ( in your css file
[00:45:09] <JKarsrud> but you could do that with JS too, you know
[00:47:16] <luke_66> JKarsrud, sorry but i dont understand...what do u mean?
[00:47:31] <JKarsrud> in http://dpaste.com/648687/
[00:48:11] <JKarsrud> you should be writing $('#slider2').attr('auto','false'); not $.('#slider2').attr('auto','false');
[00:49:57] <luke_66> oh...ok
[00:51:42] <JKarsrud> that could help you. But what is this auto attribute?
[00:53:18] <luke_66> JKarsrud, no way. it doesnt work....
[00:53:36] <JKarsrud> you'd have to put that in document ready too tho
[00:53:54] <JKarsrud> $(function() {  $('#slider2').attr('auto','false'); })
[00:54:55] <JKarsrud> unless you include your scripts just before </body>, which means all other content is loaded before your scripts are parsed and run
[00:56:12] <pashmi56> Morning from London, how can I define static function (function belongs to class) in jquery. basically i have a plugin. I need to use one of the function inside the plugin. but i dont want to redine it again: here is the plugin: http://pastebin.com/WQYv6yAh
[00:57:09] <pashmi56> the ;function i want to use is: updateMap()
[01:01:09] <Flam> I have a json array of objects with an unknown amount of key/value pairs  (ie this one has 2 http://pastie.org/private/nooeggjtpm0adhijx63aa)
[01:01:25] <Flam> How can I retrieve the count of key value pairs (2) from that json array?
[01:01:44] <aaronmcadam> .length
[01:01:49] <aaronmcadam> weeee
[01:01:57] <JKarsrud> pashmi56: look at some plugin patterns. You can either bind some custom, namespaced events to that function, or you can expose them in another way
[01:01:57] <Flam> that gives 4
[01:02:20] <Flam> which is the # of objects in the array.  I need the # of pairs in a single object in the array
[01:02:21] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: he wants to know the count of properties in the object
[01:02:31] <aaronmcadam> ok
[01:02:48] <xec> jsonData[0].length ?
[01:03:29] <aaronmcadam> huh
[01:03:46] <Flam> xec, unless im doing it wrong, undefined
[01:03:47] <JKarsrud> Flam: you could either loop and do Object.keys(obj).length (is ES5, so you would need some polyfill for browsers that don't have ES5 support)
[01:03:54] <JakeyChan> var t = $('<input type="text" class="element" title="title element" name="input">');
[01:03:54] <JakeyChan> console.log(t.html());
[01:03:56] <aaronmcadam> Flam what do u want the count of
[01:04:02] <JakeyChan> why output empty string ?
[01:04:19] <Flam> AaronCampbell_ [04:02] <Flam> which is the # of objects in the array.  I need the # of pairs in a single object in the array
[01:04:39] <aaronmcadam> so you want 4?
[01:04:46] <JKarsrud> no, he wants 2
[01:04:47] <aaronmcadam> there are 4 key/val pairs in that
[01:05:00] <xec> no there are 8 :)
[01:05:02] <JKarsrud> Flam: Object.keys(obj).length
[01:05:06] <xec> 2 in each object
[01:05:11] <aaronmcadam> don't tell him to use es5 yet
[01:05:23] <JKarsrud> or you can use this; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7956554/efficiently-counting-the-number-of-keys-properties-of-an-object-in-javascript
[01:05:28] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: why not?
[01:05:34] <Flam> JKarsrud: that would give me 2 x amount of times (x being the number of elements in the array)
[01:05:48] <aaronmcadam> cuz it's best to learn a supported spec first
[01:06:09] <JKarsrud> Flam: Not if you pass in Object.keys(jsonData[0]).length
[01:06:31] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: sure, but and that means doing a good old for them
[01:06:34] <JKarsrud> then*
[01:06:52] <aaronmcadam> lol what
[01:06:56] <nVee> hey guys. Can you use click() on floating images?
[01:07:23] <aaronmcadam> nVee: course u can
[01:07:25] <xec> ?tias @ nVee
[01:07:25] <bot-t> nVee, Try It And See
[01:07:39] <nVee> xec: I would not ask if I did not try.
[01:07:49] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: is there a way to count the keys without using a for loop without ES5 these days?
[01:07:57] <aaronmcadam> nVee are u sure your not obscuring it with other elements
[01:07:59] <JKarsrud> If so, do tell, because I want one too :)
[01:08:00] <xec> nVee: show us a demo of your code?
[01:08:05] <aaronmcadam> nVee abs positioning maybe?
[01:08:06] <nVee> hmmmm
[01:08:23] <nVee> i am dynamically adding the images using html()
[01:08:24] <aaronmcadam> JKarsrud: probably not
[01:08:26] <nVee> it floats right
[01:08:40] <nVee> but when I click on it nothing happens. Let me have a look if something's in the way
[01:08:41] <aaronmcadam> ?on @ nVee
[01:08:42] <nVee> :)
[01:08:42] <bot-t> nVee, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:08:55] <aaronmcadam> nVee you want the delegate syntax, see ?delegate
[01:08:56] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:09:16] <luke_66> JKarsrud, well i tried with that: http://dpaste.com/648700/ but it doesnt work (and maybe is normal that it doenst). the point is that i can't put the code in other part of the code but exactly in this point, since before i can't know the items count
[01:09:54] <Flam> ok so console.log(Object.keys(json[0]).length);
[01:09:55] <JKarsrud> luke_66: well, do you initialize the plugin before or after this?
[01:09:56] <Flam> worked
[01:09:57] <Flam> thanks guys
[01:10:17] <JKarsrud> Flam: you should be aware of this tho: http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/
[01:10:31] <Flam> geez
[01:10:34] <luke_66> before. in the <head> section
[01:10:36] <aaronmcadam> see
[01:10:41] <aaronmcadam> i told you JKarsrud lol
[01:10:43] <JKarsrud> so for browsers that doesn't support ES5 just yet, you need to provide some kind of fallback
[01:10:49] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: and I told him earlier
[01:10:52] <Flam> what kind of fallback >.>
[01:10:56] <aaronmcadam> a shim
[01:11:01] <aaronmcadam> myabe underscore
[01:11:20] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam:  [10:03:47] <JKarsrud> Flam: you could either loop and do Object.keys(obj).length (is ES5, so you would need some polyfill for browsers that don't have ES5 support)
[01:11:24] <aaronmcadam> Flam: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#keys
[01:11:26] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: yeah, or es5.js
[01:11:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah yeah
[01:11:31] <JKarsrud> :)
[01:11:31] <Flam> how troublesome.  I'm just going to try and see if I can find another way to approach this problem :P
[01:11:33] <aaronmcadam> but noobs don't get that
[01:11:47] <aaronmcadam> i knew you'd think that Flam
[01:11:57] <Flam> lol
[01:12:00] <aaronmcadam> :D
[01:12:17] <JKarsrud> https://github.com/JustinLove/ES5
[01:12:19] <Xotix> Is it bad to have 2 plugins which depend on each other?
[01:12:24] <aaronmcadam> yes
[01:12:39] <aaronmcadam> defeats the purpose
[01:12:43] <aaronmcadam> of a "plugin"
[01:12:50] <aaronmcadam> "plug these two in"
[01:12:54] <aaronmcadam> :D
[01:13:07] <Flam> it might work though, depends on how you define depend
[01:13:23] <JKarsrud> well, one plugin might extend another tho
[01:13:24] <aaronmcadam> conceptually it's bad
[01:13:59] <nVee> aaronmcadam: Sorry man, just want to find out, what is the difference between using on("click" ...) and click() ?
[01:14:10] <blergh> hi guys, I'm having trouble getting my CSS to appy to my .tooltip() element. I followed this instructions: http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html. The "title=" -text is correctly displayed in the tooltip, but I can't get any formatting on the text. It says that a "class=tooltip" is automatically assinged to the element I apply it to, but when I inspect my html, it's not so. Any hints to what the problem can be?
[01:14:14] <aaronmcadam> nVee read the docs man see ?delegate
[01:14:14] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:14:29] <Xotix> okay, so how should i go about it? Plugin A cares about the drag and drop.Plugin B about an inline editor. But there are some update functions which create a dependency. Should i just"outsource" there update functions, call them manually after calling the changeXXX() function?
[01:14:34] <aaronmcadam> nVee: "now or in the future" is the important bit
[01:18:36] <JKarsrud> nVee: well, using .on("click", handler) delegates events to all elements in the current set, AND in a set of elements that might not exist yet. .click(handler) binds to a current set of elements, so elements added after the binding will not have the handler attached
[01:19:45] <JKarsrud> .on() in 1.7 does .bind() .delegate() and .live(), which makes it easier for you :)
[01:21:00] <Flam> on() is pretty intense
[01:21:42] <aaronmcadam> pretty simple
[01:22:32] <lb> is the " .delay() " function not present in the current release of jquery?
[01:22:41] <aaronmcadam> lb why
[01:23:59] <lb> aaronmcadam, seems not to be working in my version (js code breaks at that line). also wasn't recognized by eclipse or netbeans for autocomplete.
[01:24:09] <aaronmcadam> hah
[01:24:15] <aaronmcadam> what's the line
[01:24:28] <lb> the sample line from the jqeruy tutorial code page
[01:24:40] <aaronmcadam> http://api.jquery.com/delay/ ?
[01:24:42] <lb> $("div.first").slideUp(300).delay(800).fadeIn(400);
[01:24:45] <lb> yes
[01:24:54] <lb> of course a different div
[01:25:17] <aaronmcadam> got a fiddle?
[01:25:24] <lb> pardon?

[01:26:22] <lb> ok ...
[01:26:28] <nVee> aaronmcadam: Thank you for your feedback, it worked. If I understand the docs correctly, you use delegate or on (1.7+) to add events to items added by jQuery? methods like click() will not work on elements not originally in the loading dom?
[01:26:43] <nVee> sorry, i just want to understand the logic without just getting a suitable answer and leaving it at that
[01:26:48] <aaronmcadam> nVee yes
[01:26:57] <aaronmcadam> nVee event delegation vs propagation
[01:27:01] <xec> aaronmcadam, lb; seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/4RW33/
[01:27:27] <aaronmcadam> yea
[01:27:36] <aaronmcadam> it's obviously something else
[01:28:00] <lb> i thought so ;) but i'm pasting my code in and see whats happening ;)
[01:30:42] <lb> aaronmcadam, http://jsfiddle.net/C9SFd/
[01:31:55] <xec> lb: http://jsfiddle.net/C9SFd/2/
[01:32:19] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[01:32:20] <xec> it's already visible, i.e fade in won't do much
[01:32:35] <xec> and you forgot to use jquery 1.7 from the dropdown on the left
[01:32:40] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:32:58] <aaronmcadam> the amount of people who don't even set up their fiddles properly :D
[01:33:06] <aaronmcadam> come on beta I want to set my defaults
[01:35:07] <j0llyr0tten> i know it sounds odd, but i'm trying to make a buton draggable and i can't, any suggestions?
[01:36:23] <Xotix> wh can't you?
[01:36:24] <j0llyr0tten> basically a mousedown and mouseup in quick succession fires the onclick event, but if the mouse is hel dow, rhe drag event is fired
[01:36:33] <lb> aaronmcadam, xec so thanks, although i dont see any difference ( except the fiddle properties) ...
[01:36:33] <Flam> 1- <button id='dragMe'>DRAG</button>   2- mousedown/mouseup/mouseout + namespaces + e.preventDefault
[01:36:46] <Flam> you can disable the button
[01:37:10] <xec> lb: i swapped the fadein and fadeout, seeing as the element already is visisble it didn't make much sense to fade it in
[01:37:10] <Flam> and *i think* style it to appear normal again
[01:37:28] <Xotix> You can disable thasic behavior of the button.
[01:37:48] <xec> visible*
[01:38:12] <j0llyr0tten> hmmm
[01:38:47] <j0llyr0tten> Flam: could you give me some details?
[01:38:50] <Mooloo> if i used get(), and got back the html as string, $("stuff", htmldata) should just work?
[01:39:00] <Xotix> j0llyr0tten: e.preventDefault(); maybe?
[01:39:09] <Flam> <button type="button" disabled="disabled">Click Me!</button>
[01:39:35] <j0llyr0tten> Xotix: e.preventDefault() in where?
[01:39:43] <Flam> onmousedown
[01:39:45] <Xotix> Why not just fake the button?
[01:41:14] <j0llyr0tten> Xotix: is that easy? I would like the button styling with a primary icon
[01:41:55] <Flam> drag/drop isn't trivial if you don't know these basics
[01:42:29] <Xotix> j0llyr0tten: So you just want an Icon, e.G. Delete,Edit wit hthe behavior of a button? Click it, do something?
[01:43:07] <Xotix> *with the
[01:43:21] <patrick99e99> exit
[01:43:39] <patrick99e99> gf3: no way!!!!!!!
[01:43:55] <j0llyr0tten> Xotix: i would like an icon with a bit of text that has the custom styling of jQ UI buttons that i can set to draggable but also perhaps do something on simple click :)
[01:44:05] <j0llyr0tten> Xotix: makes sense?
[01:44:23] <patrick99e99> I am trying to get the value of a select option, and am wondering if this is the best way?  $('#my_select').prop('options')[0].value
[01:45:12] <j0llyr0tten> Flam: Xotix: i'll try both ways: 1) turn off the default behaviour of a real button and 2) fake a button
[01:45:16] <Xotix> j0llyr0tten:  like http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#icons
[01:53:19] <amanda19> anybody knows why my slider does not rotate?   http://optimizacijadesign.com/
[01:53:28] <amanda19> i would appreciate any help
[01:56:16] <coldhead> amanda19: try loading http://optimizacijadesign.com/files/js/js_bec3a0f57df64638d0699f6d8ca08395.js AFTER your other javascript
[01:56:42] <amanda19> just a secodn let me encrypt my js files
[01:56:48] <amanda19> so you can see better
[01:56:55] <coldhead> decrypt*
[01:57:00] <Anticom> hi all
[01:57:14] <coldhead> howdy cook1es
[01:57:18] <Anticom> i'm writing a sort of highlighting script similar to firebug ones
[01:57:46] <cook1es> coldhead: hihih
[01:57:47] <beasty> where's sean ?
[01:57:53] <Anticom> now i want to implement functionality to go up and down in html DOM hierarchy on mousewheel scrolling
[01:58:06] <cook1es> coldhead: Shortest function to add leading zeros, humor me!
[01:58:14] <Anticom> that causes the problem, that i need to remember the child, from where i started going up
[01:58:26] <Anticom> and now the real problem is to kind of recontsruct the way down again
[01:58:35] <Anticom> anyone having experiences with that problem?
[01:58:40] <JKarsrud> amanda19: well, it seems you're using jQuery 1.2.6
[01:58:56] <aaronmcadam> need some good browser compat tables for methods
[01:58:57] <amanda19> yes
[01:58:58] <JKarsrud> which, to my knowledge does not support .live() which is used in nivo slider
[01:59:05] <amanda19> ohh
[01:59:06] <jita> whats the best autocomplete tags plugin in jquery ?
[01:59:10] <amanda19> so should i update?
[01:59:16] <aaronmcadam> wow 1.2.6? jesus
[01:59:22] <ShishKabab> What is the easiest way to pass along some extra parameters using Autocomplete from jQuery UI? I need completions for car models based on a brand I entered earlier.
[01:59:23] <Anticom> jita how about the jquery-ui native one?
[01:59:27] <JKarsrud> amanda19: yes.
[01:59:31] <amanda19> what??  which version is the best?
[01:59:35] <JKarsrud> The newest version of jQuery is 1.7
[01:59:42] <amanda19> omg so old
[01:59:46] <JKarsrud> so you should definitely update
[01:59:46] <JKarsrud> :)
[01:59:47] <amanda19> where to put the files?
[01:59:54] <Anticom> hahaha
[02:00:01] <Mooloo> why does this not show the whole page html?   $.get("", function(data){alert($("*", $(data)).html())});
[02:00:02] <aaronmcadam> 2008
[02:00:05] <amanda19> do you have the correct link for jquery so I dont mess it up?
[02:00:10] <aaronmcadam> http://blog.jquery.com/2008/06/04/jquery-126-events-100-faster/
[02:00:25] <JKarsrud> You have 1.2.6 in the top of your js_becomgomsfgomsdomsdfom, so you could just replace it
[02:00:31] <JKarsrud> or that is probably built, so
[02:00:33] <Anticom> Mooloo use alert($.('html').html());
[02:00:41] <JKarsrud> amanda19: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js
[02:00:46] <amanda19> yes these are build in
[02:00:52] <aaronmcadam> amanda19: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
[02:00:53] <JKarsrud> Just use that one :)
[02:00:58] <aaronmcadam> oh
[02:01:01] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/UAP9X98L may someone explain me the use of extend here?
[02:01:05] <aaronmcadam> the cdn isn't updated yet?
[02:01:32] <aaronmcadam> looks like it
[02:01:57] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: won't work, becaute jQuery1.6.4 would be replaced with 1.2.6 anyway, as the built file is included _after_ jQuery from the CDN
[02:02:05] <aaronmcadam> ahhaha
[02:02:09] <aaronmcadam> excellent :D
[02:02:12] <JKarsrud> yus
[02:02:26] <aaronmcadam> 3 years old is *aaaancient* in web terms :D
[02:02:31] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, jsapi :P
[02:02:34] <amanda19> wow, i put this <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js"></scri pt> in my site
[02:02:38] <amanda19> and the site is broken
[02:02:41] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[02:02:44] <Mooloo> anticom, where does that use data?
[02:02:54] <jita> Anticom, it only searches at the beginning of the tag name.
[02:03:12] <Tatsh> actually interesting
[02:03:23] <Tatsh> i stopped using drupal because they stupidly 'stabilise' on one jquery version
[02:03:27] <amanda19> ok there was a typo
[02:03:31] <Tatsh> they shouldn't even get involved
[02:03:32] <xec> Xotix: it basically merges default settings (name and bar) with options passed in through parameter "options"
[02:03:37] <amanda19> but the slider is gone now
[02:03:38] <Anticom> jita does it?
[02:03:40] <aaronmcadam> wtf would drupal know :D
[02:03:47] <Anticom> depends on your sql query i'd say :P
[02:03:57] <Tatsh> like drupal 7 is jquery 1.4 i think
[02:03:59] <JKarsrud> amanda19: you should replace/not include the jquery?3
[02:04:02] <Tatsh> it's certainly not 1.6 or above
[02:04:10] <Tatsh> and upgrading is not much of an option; things break
[02:04:12] <jita> Anticom, i looked into the demonstration http://xoxco.com/clickable/jquery-tags-input
[02:04:24] <amanda19> so how to replace it
[02:04:28] <Anticom> Mooloo what exactly do you want to do?
[02:04:31] <Tatsh> amanda19, you backport everything
[02:04:36] <Tatsh> because drupal sucks
[02:04:38] <amanda19> in drupal you get an allert when the module is outdated
[02:04:42] <amanda19> but all my modules seems ok
[02:04:50] <JKarsrud> Tatsh: not really, not if you just don't include the jQuery version that is bundled with drupal, no?
[02:04:53] <amanda19> i have a module in drupal called jquery update
[02:04:57] <Tatsh> JKarsrud, try it
[02:04:59] <xec> Xotix: meaning, you can send foobar an object including name and bar, and their values will be put into settings var, and if there are no options passed in, "pete" and 655 is used
[02:05:13] <JKarsrud> Tatsh: no way, I'm not touching Drupal even if my life depended on it
[02:05:20] <Tatsh> go ahead and try it; back in the day i fixed a site to work with jquery 1.3.2 (this was Drupal 6) and it took a very long time
[02:05:22] <amanda19> drupal is cool
[02:05:26] <Tatsh> Drupal 6 comes with 1.2.6
[02:05:29] <Mooloo> i want to use get() and then use selectors on the result, as if it were my document.
[02:05:44] <amanda19> so what should i do guys
[02:05:47] <aaronmcadam> ah right that's the reason
[02:05:56] <amanda19> i guess the version of jquery is correct right?
[02:05:57] <Tatsh> my site, anfplaylists.com (Drupal based); i pretty much write no-jquery JS for it other than $()
[02:05:58] <aaronmcadam> amanda19: upgrade your drupal?
[02:06:11] <amanda19> is is latest version
[02:06:17] <amanda19> d6 latest version
[02:06:19] <Anticom> jita now i see... sec, there was some facebook-like tag plugin
[02:06:19] <aaronmcadam> drupal 7 is
[02:06:23] <JKarsrud> it can't be if it has 1.2.x
[02:06:24] <Tatsh> d6 is 1.2.6
[02:06:25] <aaronmcadam> you're way behind
[02:06:29] <Tatsh> that's VERY ol
[02:06:29] <Tatsh> d
[02:06:30] <aaronmcadam> http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0
[02:06:34] <Tatsh> drupal 7 is 1.3.x
[02:06:39] <Tatsh> or 1.4.2?
[02:06:42] <Tatsh> either way it's old
[02:06:51] <aaronmcadam> last jan
[02:06:58] <Tatsh> so yeah, go through drupal.org's modules and find it; if you don't, write your own
[02:07:00] <aaronmcadam> jan the 14th
[02:07:14] <Tatsh> and you will have to backport anything that can't support your jquery version
[02:07:30] <Tatsh> tip: don't use drupal when you want flashy effects
[02:07:35] <amanda19> why they dont use latest jquery?
[02:07:48] <Tatsh> because they have a billion poorly written 'modules' that do dumb things
[02:07:54] <Xotix> xec hm thanks.
[02:07:58] <Tatsh> and these would break if they just upgraded jquery
[02:07:59] <aaronmcadam> probably cuz they don't know js
[02:08:07] <Anticom> jita: http://www.emposha.com/javascript/jquerymultiselect.html
[02:08:09] <xec> ?extend @ Xotix
[02:08:09] <bot-t> Xotix, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[02:08:17] <Tatsh> drupal is so stupid jquery was under MIT license; drupal couldn't have this
[02:08:23] <JKarsrud> seutje probably knows how to fix it tho. Ask him amanda19
[02:08:29] <Anticom> is that what you are looking for jita?
[02:08:30] <JKarsrud> I know he works with Drupal a lot
[02:08:31] <Tatsh> drupal actually convinced jQuery to be distributed under MIT/GPL
[02:08:46] <Tatsh> Drupal hates anything non-GPL; another reason i stopped workign on drupal things
[02:08:57] <amanda19> but which other cms is better then drupal, i tried them all
[02:09:03] <aaronmcadam> apart from the fact it sucks?
[02:09:16] <aaronmcadam> expression engine is the best I've used
[02:09:21] <Tatsh> amanda19, if you know PHP, http://flourishlib.com and then go get Moor
[02:09:34] <Tatsh> in effect, write your own!
[02:09:53] <jita> Anticom, looks like it, thanks for the link :)
[02:10:00] <Tatsh> otherwise, if you only need blogging, use wordpress (it allows any jquery version)
[02:10:01] <Anticom> ur welcome
[02:10:02] <amanda19> this just is so weird
[02:10:12] <amanda19> it should work my slider it is written for d6
[02:10:23] <amanda19> i saw it works on other sites but not on mine
[02:10:32] <amanda19> http://optimizacijadesign.com/
[02:10:42] <Tatsh> Object #<Object> has no method 'live'
[02:10:48] <Tatsh> you need to get the old jQuery live plugin
[02:10:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:11:17] <aaronmcadam> it's called Live Query
[02:11:24] <aaronmcadam> Tatsh: http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=jquery%20live%20plugin&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDYQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.jquery.com%2FPlugins%2Flivequery&ei=vq63TqDfCoLU8QOAheyfBQ&usg=AFQjCNHiUDdL2OyUo88Ur01k61a-Ex3iTw
[02:11:34] <jita> Anticom, in the example, select field is being used, while i have input widget, hope it goes well with it too
[02:11:37] <amanda19> can somebody check my source code  http://optimizacijadesign.com/
[02:11:40] <aaronmcadam> Tatsh: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[02:11:49] <Tatsh> amanda19, i just told you
[02:11:55] <blackspotwiggins> livequery is slow
[02:12:01] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, not at me, at amanda19
[02:12:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know
[02:12:07] <Tatsh> and yes livequery is slow :)
[02:12:18] <amanda19> but i dont know how to use that
[02:12:26] <amanda19> jquery comes with drupal
[02:12:45] <blackspotwiggins> cant have everything - you either use ḱindergarten style drupal with old and iffy/slow plugins
[02:12:51] <Anticom> jita: <input class="maininput" type="text">
[02:12:52] <blackspotwiggins> or write your own stuff using whatever you want
[02:12:52] <Tatsh> amanda19, you will need to get the js file, edit the module, add drupal_add_js(dirname(__FILE__).'/livequery-file.js')
[02:13:01] <Anticom> it IS using a regular input type text
[02:13:10] <Tatsh> you have to edit the module to add the js file or make your own
[02:13:12] <appel> I am wondering. Does animate() perform slower on higher numbers, like for scrolling?
[02:13:15] <Tatsh> or you can add it to your template
[02:13:20] <Tatsh> but this isn't #drupal
[02:13:49] <jita> Anticom, thanks for that, there seems to be one more issue, it takes in json_url, can i directly pass the array without having to redirect
[02:13:50] <jita> ?
[02:13:51] <aaronmcadam> talk about python or ruby but not php jesus :D
[02:14:34] <amanda19> uhh that is complicated
[02:14:37] <amanda19> i cant do it
[02:14:47] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, i'm writing a book for fun called 'The Perils of WordPress-style Source Code'
[02:15:02] <Xotix> thanks
[02:15:03] <aaronmcadam> what, like pure shit?
[02:15:06] <Tatsh> yup
[02:15:15] <aaronmcadam> procedural bullshit?
[02:15:16] <Tatsh> but the interesting thing is to notate ALL of the shit one by one
[02:15:25] <Anticom> jita dunno, have a look yourself. editing the plugin may be required
[02:15:26] <Tatsh> it's not all procedural
[02:15:34] <Tatsh> it's random as shit when it comes to pattern
[02:15:35] <aaronmcadam> it's one massive hack after another
[02:15:38] <jita> ok thanks Anticom
[02:15:44] <Tatsh> there's an XML parser written with regular expressions
[02:15:48] <aaronmcadam> lol
[02:15:48] <blackspotwiggins> lol
[02:16:04] <Tatsh> there's classes with camelCase and underscore_naming_style
[02:16:15] <blackspotwiggins> Tatsh, all of php has the last bit
[02:16:20] <Tatsh> there's <?php ?> blocks right in the middle of functions
[02:16:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:16:44] <Tatsh> function something() { ?><some html><?php } ?>
[02:16:52] <aaronmcadam> wtf???
[02:16:53] <Tatsh> in effect saying print '<some html>'
[02:16:57] <aaronmcadam> I know
[02:17:00] <aaronmcadam> jesus christ
[02:17:03] <Tatsh> yes that's all over the place
[02:17:04] <Tatsh> i'm not kidding
[02:17:06] <amanda19> is there another js file interfering?
[02:17:13] <Tatsh> and guess who learns this 'pattern'? wordpress plugin authors!
[02:17:26] <aaronmcadam> are u one of them?
[02:17:41] <Tatsh> i had a task recently to write a WP plugin for the first time
[02:17:59] <aaronmcadam> fun
[02:18:05] <Tatsh> first thing i did was open the entire site root in KDevelop so it can be indexed; best decision ever
[02:18:17] <Tatsh> it allowed to me to quickly inspect the implementation of every function
[02:18:27] <Tatsh> there's a global $wpdb that i still have not found where it is defined
[02:18:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah pycharm does the same for me
[02:19:02] <Tatsh> no ORM, no nice anything; no templating system (others make those)
[02:19:48] <Tatsh> the main thing is that wordpress is very presentable; and then code quality to them just doesn't matter; in fact due to the way PHP is, sloppy code can often execute faster than organised code
[02:20:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah php itself is a mess
[02:20:32] <brunus> hi all
[02:20:33] <aaronmcadam> fuckin __autoload my arse
[02:20:38] <aaronmcadam> tacked on OO model is so shit
[02:21:01] <Tatsh> yeah no real modules is my biggest issue with PHP
[02:21:13] <aaronmcadam> namespaces will help a bit
[02:21:17] <aaronmcadam> if people actually use them
[02:21:18] <Tatsh> the issue with that is no one trusts any one else to write good code anyway (no 'professionals' like PEAR)
[02:21:34] <Tatsh> aaronmcadam, not until they make the symbol : or :: and NOT \
[02:21:34] <aaronmcadam> that's cuz pear is shit
[02:21:52] <aaronmcadam> nowhere near what gem or pip is
[02:21:57] <aaronmcadam> or even npm
[02:22:01] <Tatsh> i'm switching to node
[02:22:21] <Tatsh> next version of a site is a total rewrite with node
[02:22:28] <Tatsh> one that i'm working on
[02:22:29] <aaronmcadam> I might think about writing a node cms
[02:22:43] <brunus> I have a problem with a show/hide element displaying a login form/input. The browsers autocomplete functions take focus when the login intput is clecked. And I don't know how to keep my container displayed.
[02:23:29] <Tatsh> autocomplete="off"
[02:23:33] <Tatsh> is one way
[02:24:10] <brunus> Tatsh, yes...but...hum it's not what I wanna do :) ... it's not user friendly
[02:24:29] <Tatsh> you haven't shown any code
[02:24:33] <Xotix> $(":checkbox")
[02:24:33] <Xotix>  what means the :?
[02:24:53] <Tatsh> pseudo
[02:27:00] <hoangtranwork> :checkbox is type= checkbox :)
[02:27:00] <purefusion2> is it possible to append two elements to another element via el.append(el1, el2) ?
[02:27:40] <purefusion2> purefusion: I mean, I tried it and it seems to work, but el2 is appended twice, oddly... so I wasn't sure if that was a bug or if this approach isn't officially supported
[02:27:50] <Tatsh> .append() takes variable amount of arguments iirc
[02:28:06] <Tatsh> they can be jQuery or DOM elements
[02:30:49] <purefusion2> Tatsh: so maybe the duplicate issue is a bug after all? it seems to behave fine in Chrome but not Safari, oddly enough
[02:30:58] <purefusion2> the second element is duplicated
[02:31:09] <ravenzz> ?demo @ purefusion
[02:31:10] <bot-t> purefusion, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:31:21] <bourbaki> hidiho
[02:32:14] <bourbaki> im trying to rotate an image in html5 with css on the fly
[02:32:15] <bourbaki> $('#card').css({-webkit-transform: rotate(90deg)});
[02:32:38] <bourbaki> but this wont parse how do i  pick the rotate property then?
[02:32:40] <Tatsh> bourbaki, quote '-webkit-transform'
[02:32:46] <bourbaki> sec
[02:32:56] <Tatsh> and quote 'rotate(90deg)'
[02:33:06] <Tatsh> you are not calling a function called 'rotate'
[02:33:17] <bourbaki> hm nope doesnt parse either
[02:33:33] <Tatsh> $('#card').css({'-webkit-transform': 'rotate(90deg)'});
[02:33:56] <Tatsh> without quotes and no definition for rotate symbol it is not a valid object unless you quote both the key and the value
[02:35:04] <bourbaki> ok that works but how do i set it to a value ?
[02:35:18] <bourbaki> i have an angle var that i want to set it to
[02:35:46] <Tatsh> so do normal string concatenation
[02:35:47] <ravenzz> 'rotate('+angle+'deg)'
[02:36:02] <Tatsh> ravenzz, you ALWAYS give the answer! :P
[02:36:07] <bourbaki> heh
[02:36:15] <bourbaki> so i need the deg and px and such always?
[02:36:16] <ravenzz> sorry :p
[02:36:42] <Tatsh> bourbaki, yes; read the specs on animation but i'm pretty sure rotate(90) will simply do nothing
[02:36:44] <ravenzz> If your variable is going to contain just the value, yep
[02:37:10] <Tatsh> you can probably specify in radians too
[02:37:15] <Tatsh> rad iirc
[02:37:25] <Tatsh> anyway, i'm playing some vidya games
[02:37:25] <bourbaki> thanks
[02:37:32] <ravenzz> have fu
[02:37:36] <ravenzz> +n
[02:38:12] <patrick99e99> if I have a bunch of list items in a ul..  and the 3rd item is referenced say $('#third_li') ...  Is there a way I can select all li's AFTER that one?
[02:38:14] <bourbaki> cool it works :)
[02:38:20] <patrick99e99> I thought .siblings would do it
[02:38:26] <patrick99e99> but that seems to get all li's total
[02:38:36] <patrick99e99> i just want them descending from the currently selected one
[02:38:46] <ravenzz> ?nextAll @ patrick99e99

[02:54:30] <pashmi56> hi, i have plugin which adds some A tags to the dom dynamically. I need to add click event to these a tags. however it seems like click event only worlks if i add it inside the plugin. I want to add the click outside the plugin. any suggestions?

[02:57:25] <aaronmcadam> poppiez: what are u trying to do?
[02:57:35] <aaronmcadam> why are you grabbing the html and then trying to empty it
[02:57:41] <quicksilver> poppiez: var html = $('body').html(); $('body').empty();
[02:57:46] <pashmi56> cool thanks i will have a look :)
[02:58:02] <quicksilver> ohnoes I had to type 11 more chars :)
[02:58:21] <poppiez> quicksilver: alright, thx. was just wondering if you could do it in one chained call
[02:58:50] <quicksilver> html() can't do two things at once. It can't return the HTML for you to save *and* return an object to chain off...
[02:59:43] <sontek_> Is there a way to select an element based on its innerHTML?

[03:10:42] <solidus-river> when appending to a ul, do you have to specify the surrounding <li> </li> or are they implied
[03:10:52] <solidus-river> $("ul.tags").append("some string");
[03:11:07] <solidus-river> or $("ul.tags").append("<li>some string</li>");
[03:11:08] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:11:14] <aaronmcadam> of course u need to
[03:11:24] <solidus-river> ballocks
[03:11:33] <aaronmcadam> jQuery is some sort of magic, but it's not fucking sentient
[03:11:51] <solidus-river> well, you guys get on that then
[03:11:59] <solidus-river> o_O
[03:12:20] <aaronmcadam> actually it's not all that magical at all
[03:13:35] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: your pulling my arm, computers work via imp's from intel and I have proof
[03:13:59] <aaronmcadam> bla
[03:14:06] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: the arm processor? actually an imp arm, they found out if you take away the body.. it needs less energy
[03:14:11] <poppiez> I have a page with around 100 images. I want these to load when no JS is available, however, if JS is supported I want to transform all of them to a gallery WITHOUT loading all at once. how do I prevent the images from loading when JS is supported. I tried emptying the body on dom ready with no luck
[03:14:38] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: the technology were getting these days, i'm just waiting for the HAND, now that will be efficient
[03:14:48] <aaronmcadam> why are u talking to me
[03:15:16] <solidus-river> aaronmcadam: because you were sassy, so i threw some back :P
[03:15:16] <Mooloo> after i do this: "var data; $.get("", function(d) { data = d })", why is $("html").html() not the same as $("html", $(data)).html()  ?

[03:27:01] <Zeddeh> http://pastie.org/2824947
[03:27:03] <interactivex> and I want to replace Huidig in the label
[03:27:07] <Zeddeh> thats what an element looks like in my array
[03:27:12] <Anticom> interactivex USE jsfiddle / pastebin
[03:27:35] <interactivex> Anitcom ow ok thanks. But if I use $('#myElement').html('this is the new html'); can I only change the label text?
[03:27:55] <Anticom> Zeddeh: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:28:12] <Anticom> what label text?!
[03:28:17] <Anticom> @ interactivex
[03:28:49] <interactivex> <label for="edit-submitted-klant-bij-todays-1" class="option"><input type="radio" class="form-radio" value="huidig" name="submitted[klant_bij_todays]" id="edit-submitted-klant-bij-todays-1"> Huidig</label>
[03:28:55] <interactivex> I only want to replace "Huidig"
[03:29:03] <interactivex> I now use $('#edit-submitted-klant-bij-todays-1-wrapper label').html('Ja');
[03:29:06] <interactivex> but it's not working
[03:29:07] <interactivex> :s
[03:29:26] <Anticom> interactivex USE PASTEBIN
[03:30:10] <Zeddeh> Anticom

[03:33:34] <belevele> hi, i have two articles on a page, each article has this class="blah", where .clah { color:red; }... i want to do with jquery something like this. $('blah').css(toggle('red', 'blue'); is it possible?
[03:35:50] <appel> I have a problem with animate becoming very slow the more items I have on the page, but however, it works very fast on the first elements, becoming slower on bottom elements
[03:36:49] <Robbster> hi all, is there a better way to write this:
[03:36:50] <Robbster>                 var container = $($($(this).closest("li")).children()[0]);
[03:37:34] <appel> Any ideas why animate interpolation on "top" and "left" css properties become very slow the larger the page is?
[03:37:50] <Robbster> I've got var container = $($(this).closest("li >div")).children()[0]);
[03:37:52] <Robbster> but the thinking is the same and makes my eye start bleeding
[03:40:37] <puppen> Robbster: $(this).closest("li>div:first-child"); ? Just a stab in the dark..
[03:41:41] <Lucio85> ciao a tutti
[03:41:43] <Robbster> puppen: looks a little better...
[03:42:25] <Robbster> just worked out that I actually need the parent ( the <li>), so it stays a little nasty.
[03:42:36] <larsemil> how do i get the first h3 of parent sibling object div.content ?

[04:00:26] <JKarsrud> or you can do $($string).find('h2').text();
[04:00:42] <JKarsrud> or is this php larsemil?

[04:07:42] <DannyZB> Guys there is a cloud-based ( Amazon S3 ) file hosting facebook app I made (3 month work non-stop) a lil' bit of time ago with jQuery
[04:07:46] <DannyZB> I want to make it open-source
[04:08:07] <enapupe> poppiez: try somethind like: <img class="myImage" data-src="imgsource" />
[04:08:09] <DannyZB> Who can help with making it open source code?
[04:08:30] <enapupe> poppiez: then $(".myImage").src($(this).data("src"));
[04:08:32] <DannyZB> there are easily 6-7k lines of code there
[04:08:47] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, add a license
[04:08:56] <blackspotwiggins> and remove stuff you dont want to opensource
[04:09:01] <blackspotwiggins> like your s3 keys and such
[04:09:01] <xec> enapupe: how will those images load without js?
[04:09:03] <poppiez> enapupe: problem is, browsers with no JS won't see the image
[04:09:13] <DannyZB> yea thats the thing .. I want to opensource everything
[04:09:14] <blackspotwiggins> then push it to bitbucket/github
[04:09:22] <DannyZB> I can maybe make an interface between it and S3
[04:09:35] <DannyZB> Anyway I would like help from someone with experience
[04:09:50] <DannyZB> I think it's a pretty neat library , but making it open-source is another thing altogether
[04:09:53] <xec> poppiez: try googling for "lazy loading"
[04:10:00] <DannyZB> open-source friendly *
[04:10:37] <enapupe> ops, sorry
[04:10:42] <enapupe> misreading
[04:11:11] <DannyZB> It includes : a jQuery based image viewer , a jQuery based windowing system , a jquery based Amazon S3 browser , and Facebook API bindings for facebook-based login
[04:13:07] <enapupe> poppiez: I think you cant delay the img loading without js.
[04:13:57] <xec> enapupe: sure you can, just remove the src at doc ready. images won't be loaded until onload
[04:14:30] <enapupe> xec: without js.. ?!
[04:14:36] <DannyZB> guys anyway .. where do I go to find people interested in opensource development?
[04:14:48] <xec> enapupe: without js the images will display obviously
[04:14:53] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, well freenode def. is the place
[04:15:03] <poppiez> enapupe: hmm damn
[04:15:36] <enapupe> poppiez: seriously, if you are tryng to do something that is kinda impossible, probably is because there's another way
[04:15:40] <enapupe> to do it.
[04:15:41] <DannyZB> in short : I have a -huge- heap of quality code lying around for months and no time to actually do anything with it
[04:16:04] <xec> enapupe: read the question again " I want these to load when no JS is available, "
[04:16:06] <DannyZB> If anyone here has use for a file management system based off jQuery I can help him integrate it
[04:16:50] <enapupe> xec: bet he want's it to work without JS also
[04:16:53] <enapupe> but*
[04:17:01] <DannyZB> including : video viewer , music player , file manager , user management system , code highlighther , original windowing system
[04:17:08] <DannyZB> All I ask for is help opensourcing it (:
[04:17:27] <xec> enapupe: what? no...
[04:17:36] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, why dont you just put the code out there?
[04:17:44] <poppiez> enapupe: xec: basically, if no JS is enabled it should just load all the images so that they will get a decent experience. however, if JS is enabled I want to avoid all of the images to load and show them one at a time in a gallery
[04:17:47] <blackspotwiggins> what more help do you want
[04:18:09] <DannyZB> The code needs all sorts of changes to be flexible enough for the end-user
[04:18:10] <xec> poppiez: exactly. no problem
[04:18:14] <enapupe> OK
[04:18:31] <enapupe> then you need to set the SRC before they start loading
[04:18:37] <DannyZB> + right now its a facebook app , I need to make it a Facebook-Connect system instead
[04:18:51] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, so the changes happen with the development
[04:18:58] <poppiez> enapupe: yeah exactly, but how? they start loading as soon as they enter the DOM
[04:19:08] <DannyZB> uhm maybe
[04:19:44] <xec> poppiez: no, http://jsfiddle.net/fHCek/
[04:20:17] <xec> remove the javascript, hit run and you see the images.
[04:20:51] <DannyZB> blackspotwiggins : would you say it's better to distribute it as a whole system or split it into jQuery controls ?
[04:20:54] <xec> doc ready = before image load but after dom. onload = after images
[04:20:54] <poppiez> xec: try opening firebug. the images do download anyway
[04:21:02] <DannyZB> ie : an amazon S3 file manager / jQuery windowing system / file viewer plugin
[04:21:21] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, i would split them up
[04:21:32] <blackspotwiggins> some people might want to use s3 manager, but dont want windowing
[04:21:51] <DannyZB> http://apps.facebook.com/diskonline
[04:21:55] <DannyZB> you can see what I mean there
[04:22:01] <DannyZB> thats the system as it is now *
[04:22:50] <blackspotwiggins> DannyZB, looks kinda broken
[04:23:03] <DannyZB> what browser are you using?
[04:23:20] <blackspotwiggins> firefox7
[04:23:32] <DannyZB> Me 2 and I'm not having any problems
[04:23:37] <DannyZB> what display bugs are you seeing?
[04:23:44] <blackspotwiggins> when i click on anything it logs uploader is undefinde
[04:23:47] <blackspotwiggins> undefined*
[04:23:59] <DannyZB> seriously ? weird
[04:24:03] <DannyZB> try reloading the pag
[04:24:04] <DannyZB> e
[04:24:43] <blackspotwiggins> did that
[04:25:15] <poppiez> xec: see? that's my problem
[04:25:32] <DannyZB> Thats probably a plupload bug
[04:25:36] <xec> poppiez: yes, not sure why they would load
[04:26:28] <poppiez> xec: I think as soon they enter the DOM, they just start downloading no matter what you do
[04:26:40] <DannyZB> blackspotwiggins : anyway you'll see this thing once I cut it to pieces (:
[04:26:48] <poppiez> enapupe: can you make it work?
[04:26:50] <DannyZB> It's gonna be good stuff
[04:26:52] <blackspotwiggins> the s3 thing looks interesting at least
[04:27:06] <enapupe> poppiez: just a minute. I'm checkint it locally
[04:27:10] <DannyZB> it's based off jqGrid
[04:27:23] <DannyZB> and I don't access S3 directly, it's hosted on a database
[04:27:30] <DannyZB> so there are no latencies
[04:27:41] <DannyZB> I can access it directly but that would be too slow
[04:27:49] <DannyZB> it's a file management system more than a viewer
[04:28:48] <xec> poppiez: maybe try http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[04:29:01] <DannyZB> and , by the way , it can also bind with Rackspace file hosting
[04:29:27] <xec> poppiez: check out the demo page, it only downloads image after you scroll down
[04:30:37] <poppiez> xec: what browser are you on? downloads all the images at once in firefox
[04:30:46] <xec> firefox...
[04:31:15] <poppiez> version 7.0.1 here
[04:31:24] <poppiez> this demo, right? http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/enabled.html
[04:31:37] <xec> right
[04:31:39] <Ezek2k4> i hav a div that has tables generated with php inside of it what would be the best way to generate new tables at the end of the div ?
[04:31:46] <xec> you get the first few immediately
[04:32:09] <xec> scroll down and watch the images under net tab in firebug
[04:32:33] <poppiez> xec: yeah, when you do that you get a 304 not modified (has already been loaded)
[04:33:09] <xec> poppiez: i get 200 ok, make sure to clear cache (shift+refresh)
[04:34:12] <poppiez> xec: yeah I make sure to empty the cache. you don't have some sort of aggressive browser setting with no cache?
[04:34:37] <xec> no, if i refresh normally i get 304
[04:34:59] <poppiez> weird. doesn't work here on mac
[04:35:18] <xec> i'm on a mac too :P 7.0.1 :P
[04:35:21] <Xotix> i have a bunch of functions which aren't really reusable in other projects. Would you do for such a thing a plugin or just a file with all the functions?
[04:36:36] <StPiere> i have a 3 column list positioned horizontal and a div bellow. a use jQuery hover state to make list longer, but it pushed all content bellow .. how to prevent this ?
[04:37:16] <DannyZB> Guys : what would be a catchy name for a jQuery file manager ( which binds with cloud hosting )
[04:37:27] <DannyZB> jCloud maybe ?
[04:37:44] <poppiez> xec: hehe, that's weird alright
[04:37:50] <Younos> jPad
[04:38:01] <DannyZB> lol I don't wanna be sued
[04:41:08] <poppiez> xec: looking through the comments. a lot of people saying that it doesn't work - it loads them right away
[04:41:40] <poppiez> xec: this is the proposed solution: http://www.appelsiini.net/2009/12/tuning-lazy-loader
[04:41:47] <poppiez> but it kind of breaks what I'm trying to do
[04:43:49] <xec> ye, i can't seem to be able to make it work in jsfiddle either, strange that it would work on the demo page. although it loads most of the images, just not all
[04:44:41] <poppiez> enapupe: any luck? :)
[04:44:59] <poppiez> xec: apparently, new browser versions just load the images no matter what
[04:45:01] <xec> poppiez: i'm thinking its a timing issue, with browser vendors trying to improve speed, making javascript less of a priority and more of a timing issue, like if it's quick enough to load the images it won't be able to stop it
[04:46:12] <xec> poppiez: http://jsfiddle.net/fHCek/1/
[04:46:55] <xec> poppiez: play around with the sizes, small sized images = all are loaded before scrolling
[04:47:07] <xec> poppiez: with big images only 4 or so are loaded

[04:49:04] <xec> js_node: that's the exact same url?
[04:49:15] <poppiez> xec: true, if the images are huge, it kind of works
[04:49:52] <js_node> xec: yeah, that's same,
[04:49:54] <js_node> typo
[04:50:02] <xec> poppiez: making me think that, if the images are loaded that quickly, it probably doesnt matter if they are
[04:52:15] <poppiez> xec: what if you are on a slow connection like a mobile phone? it might start downloading 3 images, which could take minutes

[04:52:49] <xec> poppiez: i'm thinking if an image load is slow it is possible to stop it, but when it's quick, javascript is too late... so to speak
[04:52:54] <poppiez> xec: it has a noscript proposition. that's just not that google friendly
[04:53:55] <js_node> someone know how to match, in javascript?

[04:54:50] <dw> hi. is  $(parentSel).find(childSel)  equivalent to $(childSel, parentSel)  ?
[04:55:19] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[04:55:22] <dw> thanks :)
[04:55:39] <amh345> can anyone help me with this. i was using jquery swf object but had issues with it.   now im using swfobject.embedSWF.   is there a way i can insert that object in a div much like jquery swf object did?
[04:55:44] <dw> can parentSel in the latter case be a jQuery object containing more than one element?
[04:55:45] <js_node> xec: thanks, but it is matching even, onMouseover1
[04:56:00] <js_node> http://jsfiddle.net/a4f42/15/
[04:56:00] <xec> poppiez: tbh i would go with the first thing i suggested, remove (and remember) the src attribute. i doubt mobile browsers would throw a hissy fit over that
[04:56:45] <xec> js_node: yes it does. what exactly do you want to do?
[04:57:11] <js_node> only the word, onMouseover
[04:57:36] <xec> js_node: may i ask why? does it ever have a value?
[04:59:47] <js_node> yeah xec i am sending some values through span from my php.  in the client side, i am checking for an event, onMouseover, to do an action, i want to detect whether the string contrains onMouseover, onMouseover1 may be having in the sent string also, so i do not want to take that risk
[05:00:26] <poppiez> xec: I guess, it just annoys me :P
[05:00:39] <xec> js_node: so then, onMouseover will always end in an equal sign?
[05:00:52] <js_node> yeah
[05:01:38] <xec> js_node: then slap an equal sign at the end of the regex
[05:03:50] <Xotix> Whats a good approach for "code management" with jQuery?
[05:07:45] <amh345> how do i insert an object inside a div?   i tried $('#my_div").append(my_object) as well as $('#my_div").html(my_object)  but both appeared to have wiped out #my_div and replaced it with object.   i need to get it like <div>object</div>
[05:08:12] <Ezek2k4> how i delete a table? i know that i can add it this way $("#items").append('<table id="tblid' + ic + '"><tr></td>test1234</td></tr></table>');
[05:09:05] <Ezek2k4> hmm maybe remove
[05:10:34] <Xotix> amh345: what object?
[05:10:53] <amh345> Xotix: it's a flash object using swfobject.embedSWF
[05:11:08] <js_node> thanks xec , i will try, bye

[05:14:04] <amh345> xec: var my_object = swfobject.embedSWF("test.swf", "beam", "1024", "240", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes);      $('#my_div).append(my_object);
[05:14:44] <gurde> hello
[05:15:54] <xec> amh345: hmm, i've never tried to insert a flash object before... the docs say append() will accept a DOM object, maybe swfobject doesnt qualify?
[05:16:03] <gurde> $('#element').slideDown().delay(10000).slideUp(); $('#element').click(function(){ $('#element').slideUp(); }); why won't the element slide up when clicked?
[05:17:41] <amh345> xec: im trying to hide and show the object.   if my object has id="my_object"    would document.getElementById('my_object').show(); be the correct way to show it?
[05:18:28] <Xotix> ;(function($) {  whats the ; for?
[05:18:32] <xec> i doubt .show() is a valid method of a plain javascript DOM object
[05:19:16] <Logitech> Hello, why is: $(this).attr('rel');  returning "1111ZZ000" instead of the actual value -> "1111ZZ 000" ?
[05:19:17] <xec> Xotix: it's an escape in case the script is concatenated at the end of another script iirc
[05:19:39] <MACscr> is doing a search autocomplete with php/mysql as much of a pain as it looks to be? I might take the lazy way out and do a select list instead, but search with autocomplete would be ideal
[05:19:45] <Xotix> ah okay
[05:19:49] <Xotix> thanks
[05:20:19] <amh345> xec: do you have any recommendations ?
[05:21:22] <xec> amh345: maybe something like:  document.getElementById('my_object').style.display="none";
[05:22:00] <xec> or $(document.getElementById('my_object')).hide();
[05:22:08] <amh345> xec: in my css i have display:none.  and in my function in the js i have document.getElementById('my_object').style.display="";
[05:22:22] <amh345> it starts off, and then the function turns it on
[05:22:27] <xec> document.getElementById('my_object').style.display="block";
[05:22:31] <xec> perhaps
[05:22:47] <nFFF> When a suer clicks on an input field, I want to change the css of that field
[05:22:53] <nFFF> any inbuitl jquery function?
[05:23:14] <nFFF> like add a class to the html called 'active' or something
[05:23:23] <xec> nFFF: .addClass() ?
[05:23:34] <nFFF> and then have .form .active { }
[05:23:35] <Famic_> ?focus
[05:23:35] <bot-t> .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[05:24:11] <amh345> xec: document.getElementById('my_object').style.display="block";   did it. thank you
[05:24:21] <Famic_> nFFF: there is a :focus selector in css
[05:24:25] <gurde> $('#element').slideDown().delay(10000).slideUp(); $('#element').click(function(){ $('#element').slideUp(); }); Why won't the element slide up when clicked?
[05:25:05] <Famic_> amh345: $('#my_object').css('display','bock') is fine too ;p
[05:25:48] <xec> gurde: i'm guessing delay is delaying the animation ;) maybe try setTimeout instead
[05:29:08] <xec> Logitech: do you have a demo of your issue?  what is $(this)
[05:29:44] <gurde> xec: but why would delay() delay another slideUp() call?
[05:30:17] <puppen> gurde: is it because it's already 'up' ?
[05:30:32] <xec> gurde: tbh i'm not 100% on this, but i'm guessing the next sludeUp is just added to the queue
[05:31:14] <xec> gurde: so in the queue you basically get delay(10000).slideUp().slideUp()
[05:33:37] <xec> Logitech: http://jsfiddle.net/LBats/
[05:33:41] <nFFF>  $("input").focus(function () { $(this).addClass("focused");  });  ?
[05:34:49] <xec> nFFF: that looks promising, but the class will stay there even when you click on another input
[05:35:10] <puppen> nFFF: (in your stylesheet) input:focus {} ?
[05:35:43] <gurde> puppen: is not up
[05:38:20] <nFFF> xec, yea just realised, how do you remove the class when you click on another?
[05:38:35] <nFFF> puppen, I want to effedct two elements on focus
[05:38:40] <nFFF> CSS allows only the effect one
[05:38:59] <xec> nFFF: .blur() ?
[05:39:23] <xec> i think thats the opposite of focus
[05:39:33] <xec> ?blur
[05:39:33] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[05:40:07] <nights> hi
[05:41:31] <xec> gurde: maybe you can use .stop().slideUp() in your event, see ?stop
[05:41:31] <bot-t> gurde, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[05:42:21] <nFFF> xec, but basically when they click on one inoput add class 'focused', when they click on next input I need to remove the class 'focused' from previous input
[05:42:37] <xec> gurde: or actually *just* .stop() seeing as .slideUp() is next in line anyway
[05:43:04] <nights> something wrong in doing: newElem.children(':lt(1)').attr('i ?
[05:43:15] <nights> lt(2), etc
[05:43:20] <xec> nFFF: yes, .blur() should trigger on the element that *lost* focus
[05:43:27] <nights> for some reason it doesnt seem to capture the right element
[05:43:42] <nFFF> Ahh gotcha
[05:45:21] <nights> https://gist.github.com/1345004
[05:45:41] <nights> although i want each element to individually index up, only hours_day  change
[05:45:45] <damian004> huh, hilight for "004"
[05:45:47] <damian004> ;d
[05:46:00] <nights> i cant figure out why, could anyone advice please?
[05:46:13] <nights> im using lt(i) to select items
[05:46:22] <nights> as children of the div named input
[05:46:30] <nights> or id:d
[05:49:07] <nFFF> xec, anyway when they focus on input, andway to add class to label element?
[05:49:44] <asher^> hi guys, im having a problem with .merge, im using it like this: $.merge(options, data); where options is an array i have created, and data is the response in json format from a .ajax request. anyone know what im doing wrong?
[05:49:58] <Gorkyman_> hm.. do you guys think that creating a form when some <a> inputs would set <input fields is a good idea?
[05:50:36] <Gorkyman_> I want a little more customization with designing forms... so I would set input fields with jquery by clicking divs/links
[05:50:36] <adrianp> Gorkyman_: elaborate?
[05:50:58] <Gorkyman_> just thinking if that would be smart
[05:51:08] <adrianp> Gorkyman_: yes, that is possible
[05:51:22] <Gorkyman_> I know, but is it a good practice?
[05:51:40] <adrianp> what fields are you adding?
[05:52:34] <nights> could anyone please advice, i'm trying to clone a few fields and set their respective name , id , however all of them get changed to whatever the last element has
[05:52:39] <nights> https://gist.github.com/1345004
[05:52:56] <Gorkyman_> well... like I want a selection of elements, but none of the form elements are good enough... I want to look like boxes etc...
[05:53:06] <nights> im using newElem.children(':lt(3)'). etc to select the various elements
[05:53:47] <zamba> i'm looking for a jquery plugin that does both date and time
[05:54:03] <zamba> i don't need seconds, but i need year, month, date, hour and minutes
[05:54:41] <Ezek2k4> how i add something to the value of a hidden field witout remplacing what is already there
[05:54:44] <devaholic> javascript does date and time
[05:55:04] <devaholic> ezek: get the value first, then concat them
[05:56:47] <DannyZB> Guys : how do I apply the GNU-GPL on a project ?
[05:57:09] <DannyZB> I just include the license file in the project folder or are there other things I need to do?
[05:57:24] <Ezek2k4> crap i was disc
[06:22:49] <nFFF> When I user focus on an input field, I want to add a class to two elements. $(this).addClass() adds one to the current element, but how do I add one to the label elemtn also?
[06:22:54] <fakingfantastic> is there a quick way to check if any of the values in a form have changed? I am building a string based on form values, and I pretty much need updating form values and updating the string to be 1:1 without binding on each item?
[06:23:31] <fakingfantastic> like is there a form event when is data changes?
[06:23:48] <lime> nFFF instead of $(this) put $("#another_element")
[06:24:44] <xec> nFFF: can you pastebin your markup?
[06:24:48] <context> fakingfantastic: eventes do bubble.
[06:24:55] <context> fakingfantastic: bind to the form or use delegate
[06:25:50] <fakingfantastic> context: which event?
[06:26:17] <fakingfantastic> context: (maybe im missing the obvious, here)
[06:28:45] <nFFF> lime, I only want to select the previous label, or one label
[06:28:51] <nFFF> not every label
[06:29:20] <lime> alright, then you'll have to wait for someone else to reply :)
[06:29:59] <nFFF> xec, any ideas?
[06:30:14] <xec> nFFF: can you pastebin your markup?
[06:31:35] <nFFF> http://pastebin.com/3GqbDnvZ
[06:32:11] <nFFF> Basically a bunch of pairs: <label> and <input>
[06:32:25] <nFFF> When someone focus's on <input>
[06:32:28] <nFFF> I want to add a class to the current set of label and input elements
[06:32:43] <nFFF> Adding a class to the input is fine
[06:32:50] <nFFF> but hwo to also add a class to the label element
[06:32:51] <xec> nFFF: if you can rely on your markup to stay the same you can just do $(this).prev()
[06:33:31] <nFFF> xec, will that select the previous element, i.e. <p> <span> etc
[06:33:34] <nFFF> becuase it needs to be the previous <label>
[06:33:43] <xec> nFFF: previous sibling, yes
[06:34:04] <xec> nFFF: if the markup may change, you would need to refine the selection based on the for attribute
[06:35:29] <nFFF> xec, so basically $(this).prev("label").addClass("focus");
[06:35:49] <xec> you don't need to specify "label" but yes
[06:36:40] <xec> specifying "label" will just make sure nothing gets selected if the previous sibling is not a label
[06:41:13] <nFFF> xec, is there a selector for when someone actually starts typing within the input field?
[06:42:52] <xec> nFFF:  hmmm, maybe.. see ?change
[06:42:52] <bot-t> nFFF, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[06:44:05] <ibike365> xec, how about binding on keyup or keypress?
[06:46:50] <context> idoru: what about it... bind to whatever you want
[06:46:54] <context> err
[06:46:56] <context> ibike365: *
[06:47:11] <context> ibike365: you know you could answer these questions quicker yourself by just actually trying them...
[06:50:22] <abracsi> hi guys. I'm looking for a plug in, that would allow you to look at mutliple staff time tables, to see who's on shift and their workload. but i don't quite know what to call it. when i type planner/calendar i just get calendar plug ins that only care about one person
[06:50:27] <ibike365> i wasn't asking a question
[06:50:56] <ibike365> i was offering a suggestion to xec
[06:51:07] <context> oh
[06:51:35] <xec> context took something out of context :D
[06:51:47] <ibike365> true
[06:53:21] <ibike365> abracsi - that sounds pretty specific and not something i'd expect to find a plug-in for
[06:58:44] <abracsi> ibike365, perhaps. but seeing various people's schedules side by side i would have thought was a fairly common problem
[06:59:14] <mbroadst> I'm having an issue with the .load() method.. when I call load on a div with a url with a number of parameters in IE8, the only thing that is loaded is part of the URL string, as text. Has anyone seen this before?
[07:08:03] <mbroadst> any ideas on how to test the problem? Im not quite sure how to go about even tracing it
[07:08:36] <mbroadst> happens in compatibility mode as well
[07:10:08] <context> mbroadst: is the request even being made
[07:13:06] <mbroadst> context: looks like it was a really old version of jquery (~1.5) and some crufty code :)
[07:13:48] <nFFF> xec, jQuery("input").change(function () { jQuery(this).prev("label").addClass("changed");});
[07:13:50] <nFFF> doesn't seem to work
[07:14:33] <xec> ?demo @ nFFF
[07:14:33] <bot-t> nFFF, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[07:18:10] <DannyZB> Where can I find the documentation on writing jQuery UI controls ?
[07:19:45] <black_warlock> hello
[07:20:10] <black_warlock> DannyZB on the jquery website
[07:20:53] <DannyZB> I found the page on plugin authoring
[07:20:56] <black_warlock> guys who can help me updating on the fly a div , while i m writing in a FCKeditor input box ?
[07:21:07] <DannyZB> but where is the page on jQuery UI plugin authoring
[07:21:22] <ajpiano> DannyZB: the docs on the ui widget factory are somewhat disparate and evolving right now, i have a presentation on it that could help, and has some links at the end
[07:21:23] <ajpiano> ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[07:21:45] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/SdTCx/
[07:21:47] <DannyZB> am I better off making a regular plugin?
[07:21:49] <nFFF> Pwease hlp
[07:22:03] <DannyZB> and thanks *
[07:22:11] <ajpiano> DannyZB: no one can say that knowing nothing about what you intend to build
[07:22:25] <ajpiano> the widget factory is really good for more complex "stateful" widgets
[07:22:25] <Xotix> If i want to get all css of an   element, how do i do that without having x lines of code?
[07:22:34] <DannyZB> A jQuery Amazon S3 file manager
[07:23:05] <DannyZB> ajpiano : I don't even know what that means lol
[07:23:07] <ajpiano> sounds like the widget factory would be helpful then
[07:23:17] <DannyZB> The code is already written
[07:23:25] <DannyZB> I just need to make a plugin out of it
[07:23:34] <ajpiano> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[07:23:35] <ajpiano> hmm
[07:23:43] <ajpiano> sounds like you might just need a plugin wrapper around it then
[07:23:50] <nFFF> xec, back yet?
[07:23:54] <DannyZB> whats that?
[07:23:59] <first1> hey ajpiano: not sure if you remember from last night... but it turns out tablesorter had its own update method. $("table").trigger("update");
[07:24:06] <first1> so simple yet I spent hours on that :P
[07:24:19] <ajpiano> $.fn.s3filemanager = function() {  $.data( this, "s3filemanager", new S3FileManager(this) );   }
[07:24:26] <ajpiano> first1: i didn't even know you were using tablesorter
[07:24:51] <DannyZB> ajpiano: thx *
[07:25:04] <first1> I'm new to jQuery. I thought it was something the theme creator did.. but no, it was a standard jQuery plugin
[07:25:11] <first1> live and learn
[07:25:15] <first1> thank you again for your help however
[07:25:30] <ajpiano> np
[07:26:14] <black_warlock> this fckeditor making me crazy =\
[07:26:18] <black_warlock> http://pastebin.com/9g4V183t
[07:26:41] <ajpiano> black_warlock: how does one spell the word "change'
[07:26:41] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/SdTCx/ -> .change() isn't adding a class to the element
[07:26:54] <black_warlock> how can i update on fly a div with the preview of what has been written inside fckeditor  input box ?
[07:27:13] <ajpiano> black_warlock: start by spelling "onChange" correctly
[07:27:30] <ajpiano> wtf
[07:27:30] <black_warlock> hell
[07:27:33] <black_warlock> yes
[07:27:33] <ajpiano> did you just make up this code
[07:27:36] <black_warlock> :D
[07:27:42] <black_warlock> yup
[07:27:53] <jedimind> i make up code all the time!
[07:27:56] <ajpiano> did you know that CKeditor actually has documentation
[07:28:31] <black_warlock> dont use ckeditor
[07:28:46] <black_warlock> has no support for asp lenguange
[07:28:46] <ajpiano> lol why are you using FCKEditor
[07:29:08] <black_warlock> lenguage*
[07:29:42] <BlaDe^> is it possible to put a file object (i.e. from a drag handler) into an <input type="file" /> ?
[07:29:46] <black_warlock> and i have tried to update it but the file menager sux
[07:29:51] <BlaDe^> $('input').val(file) for example
[07:30:00] <black_warlock> kinda better the old fckeditor
[07:30:15] <BlaDe^> or $('<input type="file" /"').val(file).appendTo('#someForm');
[07:30:35] <BlaDe^> with a > instead of a " ... :)
[07:30:45] <nFFF> Anyone?
[07:31:25] <ajpiano> black_warlock: read this, i think it has the documentation you're looking for
[07:31:28] <ajpiano> http://docs.cksource.com/FCKeditor_2.x/Developers_Guide/JavaScript_API
[07:31:35] <ajpiano> hint: there is no "onChange" documented
[07:31:52] <NoNoNo> BlaDe^: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications
[07:33:03] <BlaDe^> NoNoNo: that show using FileReader but doesn't answer my question explicitly (that I can see)
[07:33:04] <black_warlock> what the flick !
[07:33:12] <black_warlock> the asp has been implemented !
[07:33:15] <nFFF> Anyone know how to the fire an event when an someone starts typing in an input text field
[07:33:23] <nFFF> I have .focus for when the click on it
[07:33:29] <NoNoNo> BlaDe^: maybe https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[07:33:29] <first1> nFFF: why not use click or focus ?
[07:33:35] <black_warlock> the last time i have downloaded ckeditor there was nothing about asp inside
[07:33:35] <first1> err, click or change
[07:33:37] <_dave_h_d> hi all, anyone know of some real nice documentation packages out there, right now we are using trac wiki, its cool but there must be something better out there?
[07:33:43] <ibike365> nFF use keyup or keydown
[07:33:44] <nFFF> first1, change isnt working
[07:33:52] <nFFF> ibike365, I only want it to trigeer once
[07:34:02] <first1> _dave_h: have you looked at JIRA ?
[07:34:06] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/SdTCx/
[07:34:14] <nFFF> change isn't working
[07:35:29] <ibike365> nFFF you can use .one()
[07:35:33] <ibike365> ?.one()
[07:35:34] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/

[07:38:31] <tony_> Hello!
[07:38:32] <nFFF> not working :>
[07:38:38] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/SdTCx/
[07:38:58] <ibike365> nFFF checking it out
[07:39:10] <tony_> is this chat have russian people?
[07:39:33] <nFFF> Sorry it does work
[07:39:37] <nFFF> forgot to click run :)
[07:39:54] <mats_> I have 10+ boxes with the div class "box", which I hide. when i hover over an element i want do display the hidden div box, but not all of them. just the one i'm hovering over. how do i fix such a thing?
[07:39:55] <nFFF> thanks ibike365
[07:40:05] <tony_>  i have some quetions about mail lists.
[07:40:11] <iknite> BMCouto: $.ajax({url:'whatever', statusCode:{301: functionName, 404: function (){ alert('404' }}} //jquery 1.6.4
[07:40:24] <DannyZB> Is there a good jQuery to Facebook binding plugin ?
[07:40:29] <iknite> BMCouto: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ see statusCode
[07:40:44] <DannyZB> I have binding code between jQuery and the Facebook API written down
[07:41:18] <ibike365> nice
[07:41:19] <BMCouto> iknite:  DannyZB I have seen statusCode, but it doesnt has any argument, I dont see how can I grab the url that its redirecting
[07:42:04] <DannyZB> Is there such a plugin or not?
[07:42:20] <jedimind> do we look like google ?
[07:42:26] <ibike365> mats_ $(".myclass").hover(function() { $(this).show(); });
[07:42:31] <tony_> who khows? How does mail lists make?
[07:43:27] <ajpiano> tony_: this channel has nothing to do with mailing lists
[07:43:36] <ajpiano> DannyZB: i've never heard of anything like that
[07:43:49] <DannyZB> Cool (: so there will be one soon
[07:44:14] <mats_> ibike365: but i'm hovering over another div class, forgot to mention that. i want div x to appear when hovering over div y, but div x should only appear over that specific div y and not all div y's. do you understand? hehe
[07:44:39] <jgspratt> what's the right way to reference the best jquery external library?  that is, I want to reference a jquery library hosted by someone else on my webpage
[07:44:59] <tony_> <jgspratt>\
[07:45:24] <nFFF> ibike365, ok I want to add a bit more complexity if possible: when they enter the text into the field, trigger an event (ok keydown() is workign), but if they delete this same text, if text is NULL fire another event
[07:45:31] <ibike365> mats_ does div y have any kind of relation to div x?
[07:45:59] <visua> Hey, anyone know of a plugin/lib that functions similar to ScrollSpy for MooTools?
[07:46:06] <ibike365> using one will only fire the event binding one time
[07:46:26] <jgspratt> what did he mean by \?
[07:46:40] <ibike365> maybe instead of doing this, fire it on every keychange event and check the value
[07:46:49] <mats_> ibike365: yeah, div x is inside div y. i have a simple script, but it just make div x appear over all my boxes, but it should only be for the one i'm currently hovering over
[07:47:36] <ibike365> $(this).find("div-y").show()
[07:47:56] <ibike365> make sense?
[07:49:18] <iknite> BMCouto: https://gist.github.com/1345319 then try this approach
[07:49:38] <iknite> :)
[07:50:03] <mats_> ibike365: yeah, that worked. thanks a lot. so what did we do? said that upon hovering "this" element, find div y and show it? just that simple?
[07:50:09] <Xotix> how cna i achieve something like $(this textarea).hasClass()
[07:50:31] <ibike365> yes
[07:50:31] <joshsmith> is 1.7 still not on Google's CDN?
[07:50:57] <ibike365> mats_ you are using .find() to search the current div's children for that element
[07:51:02] <Jayflux> joshsmith nope
[07:51:16] <joshsmith> argh. I thought it was happening today
[07:51:25] <Jayflux> joshsmith it may happen later on today
[07:51:39] <mats_> ibike365: ok. thanks for explaining so i can learn :)
[07:51:46] <visua> Hmm..i found a guy who seems to have ported David Walshes scroll spy to jquery
[07:51:53] <visua> but I don't know how good it is :|
[07:51:56] <joshsmith> Jayflux: yeah, but by then I'll forget :P
[07:53:37] <BMCouto> iknite:  will check :)
[07:54:32] <BMCouto> iknite:  you did it on complete for any specific reason or its available on success?
[07:55:52] <BMCouto> iknite:  and where can i grab the url from the redirect?
[07:56:09] <BMCouto> cause i want to grab it only is there is a redirect...
[07:57:31] <iknite> BMCouto: complete run everytime even if it fails, (302 sounds like a fail for me, but check it)
[07:58:32] <BMCouto> ok, but this 302 is a intended redirect
[07:58:47] <BMCouto> anyway i cant see where i can check if it is a redirect or not
[07:58:49] <iknite> and it should be transparent for end use
[07:59:22] <iknite> so maybe you didn't need to redirect manually
[07:59:48] <BMCouto> iknite:  the point is, im changing de url everytime i call a page with ajax, but if the server redirects (302) i need to redefine the var that saves the url
[08:00:26] <BMCouto> so i want something like if(302) var url = redirectedUrl
[08:00:30] <BMCouto> got the idea?
[08:00:42] <iknite> of course ;)
[08:00:57] <BMCouto> iknite:  any idea how to do it?
[08:02:09] <iknite> inside xhr.settings you have all the initial value, so when reaches the complete you have the new url inside xhr, and the original call params in xhr.settings
[08:02:27] <iknite> so recall another $.ajax with the changes you need
[08:02:41] <BMCouto> iknite:  yes but inside xhr.seeting, nothing tell me "ok this is a 302)
[08:02:52] <iknite> no it's xhr.status
[08:03:07] <iknite> make a console.log in complete and check the output
[08:03:54] <jgspratt> is it legit to do this: var loc=window.location.hash; ?
[08:03:55] <BMCouto> iknite:  ok just a minute
[08:04:36] <jgspratt> if not, how can I define a variable to be the window.location.hash?
[08:06:29] <pifantastic> jgspratt: yes, that is legal
[08:06:36] <pifantastic> but also
[08:06:38] <pifantastic> ?tias
[08:06:39] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:06:45] <Cira> Heya, I'm having trouble making lavaLamp initializing correctly. The link effect is not initially placed over the 'current' link, but instead randomly over 3 links... After I mouseover any link everything works great, but the initial look of the page when loaded isn't ok... can anyone help?
[08:06:57] <BMCouto> iknite:  I did it and nothing tells me its a 302
[08:06:57] <Cira> In this image you can see the problem (top half) and the correct behaviour AFTER I mouseover any link (bottom half): http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/5273/problemk.gif
[08:07:05] <Cira> I can supply the HTML and CSS code if needed
[08:07:24] <pifantastic> Cira: Make sure that the layout is in place before you initialize lavaLamp
[08:07:41] <pifantastic> Otherwise it may try to calculate sizes based off of a layout that is still changing
[08:08:02] <Cira> hmz, you mean comment out the lavalamp initialization and see how things look without it?
[08:08:12] <jgspratt> pifantastic: I get "syntax error" when I use that.  what am I doing wrong? http://dordt.edu/tintle/index.html#index
[08:08:14] <iknite> BMCouto: 302 should be handled by the server transparently, check with charles app, or some proxy if it's automatic
[08:09:04] <pifantastic> iknite: you are missing an opening { after function()
[08:09:15] <BMCouto> iknite:  yes, but the problem is that i need to change the url on the address bar
[08:09:24] <BMCouto> so i need to know that a redirect happened
[08:09:26] <pifantastic> shit
[08:09:28] <pifantastic> sorryt iknite
[08:09:41] <pifantastic> jgspratt: you are missing an opening { after function()
[08:10:03] <pifantastic> jgspratt: in fact, you are missing several things
[08:10:28] <jgspratt> oh, I'm fixing that.  yeah, my silly bad
[08:11:08] <black_warlock> ajpiano : how do you customize bars in ckeditor ?
[08:11:14] <pifantastic> jgspratt: https://gist.github.com/fc2c93b837f19d3bb7ed
[08:12:11] <jgspratt> pifantastic: yep, got it.  now, does that not work if I have display:none set in css?
[08:13:01] <andrew9183> anyone know of a preferred image resizer they use for jquery ?
[08:14:59] <pifantastic> jgspratt: No, it should work fine
[08:15:47] <pifantastic> jgspratt: http://grimhappy.com/i/acecf.png
[08:15:57] <pifantastic> Note that the hash will start with '#'
[08:16:48] <judofyr> I'm having trouble animating a margin-left from -10065px to -10980px
[08:17:05] <caddoo> what is the fastest way to identify different rows in a table
[08:17:11] <caddoo> is class searching fast?
[08:17:33] <judofyr> $.fn.animate seems to animate it from 0 to -10980px instead :/
[08:19:18] <jgspratt> pifantastic: oh, I get it.  the location.hash has the # in the var.  how did you get that console that you can type in?
[08:19:21] <mctux> hi folks
[08:19:43] <mctux> i have errors when load jquery-1.3.2-min
[08:20:05] <NoNoNo> mctux: please try 1.7
[08:20:05] <mctux> and jquery ui 1.7.3 or jquery-ui-1.8.16
[08:20:53] <Cira> pifantastic: I dont know what to look for.. everything looks fine to me but for some reason it initializes improperly
[08:21:38] <jgspratt> pifantastic: ok, now, how can I get that to fire more than just on the first document load?  when I click the # links on my page, nothing happens, but when I go to a hash page (like http://dordt.edu/tintle/#program ), I get to the right page.
[08:28:11] <gf3> patrick99e99: hola
[08:31:27] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, i have a script calling a php file, and even though it executes and gets a return text, i see in firebug "NetworkError: 404 Not Found -... anyone got any idea why i am getting this?
[08:32:25] <NoNoNo> dinosaadeh: maybe the scripts returns a 404 HTTP status code?
[08:32:27] <nFFF> When someone clicks on an input text field, I want a popover to come up with text in it
[08:32:32] <nFFF> is this possible?
[08:33:04] <tmayr> yes it is
[08:33:15] <nFFF> How so?
[08:33:23] <dinosaadeh> NoNoNo: when i open the same url in a tab, i can see the resulting text returned by the php script
[08:33:28] <tmayr> nFFF: one sec
[08:33:44] <denisbr> Hi All, Anybody have any simple sample for move elements between two select field, but, with optgroup ?
[08:34:08] <black_warlock> does anyone knows how to customize bars in ckeditor ?
[08:34:49] <pifantastic> jgspratt: You basically want the onhashchange event
[08:34:53] <pifantastic> which is not X-browser
[08:34:59] <pifantastic> but I would recommend looking at this:
[08:35:02] <pifantastic> ?bbq
[08:35:10] <pifantastic> ergh
[08:35:16] <pifantastic> ?g ben alman bbq
[08:35:27] <pifantastic> bot-t!
[08:35:50] <pifantastic> jgspratt: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[08:36:16] <pifantastic> That plugin gives you a hashchange event
[08:36:17] <pifantastic> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/
[08:36:19] <tmayr> god jsfiddle is slow...
[08:36:53] <tmayr> nFFF: hold on tight, trying to make an example
[08:37:27] <NoNoNo> dinosaadeh: The text is in the HTTP body, the HTTP status is separate in the HTTP header; so you can send a normal HTML page with 404 status :)
[08:38:44] <dinosaadeh> NoNoNo: please explain, didnt follow
[08:38:56] <CodyPChristian> Hey guys, any idea why .on wouldn't load in Chrome or FF when using jQuery 1.7? Needing to replace my .live instances with .on
[08:39:02] <mctux> i have a problem with jquery-ui-1.8.16  and jquery1.3.2
[08:39:10] <nFFF> tmayr, thanks :>
[08:39:11] <mctux> html appear 2 times
[08:39:19] <digidak> try explaining ur problem
[08:39:32] <tmayr> cant believe i just spent 5 minutes wondering why this was being null and i had mootools selected
[08:39:41] <mctux> head of webpage , is repeat 2 times
[08:41:09] <mctux> head html appear 2 times , one in normal head
[08:41:26] <mctux> no no sorry
[08:41:31] <mctux> full page is like a mirror
[08:41:33] <tmayr> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/P22TR/1/
[08:41:35] <tmayr> is this what you're after?
[08:41:56] <mctux> after jquery-ui object , there appear again webpage , like a mirror
[08:42:04] <mctux> somebody know it
[08:42:05] <mctux> ?
[08:42:49] <ryanneufeld> mctux: you need to provide an example
[08:42:55] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ mctux
[08:42:55] <bot-t> mctux, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:43:07] <jaequery> anyone know of other alternatives to twitter css bootstrap?
[08:43:29] <NoNoNo> dinosaadeh: the payload (HTML, PLAINTEXT or JSON) is independent from the HTTP status; normal 200 = ok, maybe 404 = not found
[08:43:29] <nFFF> tmayr, exactly what I needed thanks
[08:43:30] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: in what regard?
[08:43:40] <digidak> does any one have any tips on how I can build a mobile im client using jquery
[08:43:53] <tmayr> nFFF: you probably want to set the input and popup to 100% width and  give the container the width you want, should be easier, if you need anything else let me know
[08:44:14] <jaequery> the css total package?
[08:44:52] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: css total package... what exactly are you looking for? You want an alternative grid system?
[08:45:18] <ryanneufeld> jaequery: cause there are tones out there
[08:45:19] <visua> I think he means a fully styled library
[08:45:29] <visua> I dunno who would want that though :\
[08:45:32] <ryanneufeld> visua: he might, but he hasn't said that ;)
[08:45:38] <visua> True.
[08:45:54] <dinosaadeh> NoNoNo: could it be for php is returning text using die?
[08:46:44] <CodyPChristian> Anyone? "Hey guys, any idea why .on wouldn't load in Chrome or FF when using jQuery 1.7? Needing to replace my .live instances with .on"
[08:47:03] <bot-t> CodyPChristian, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:47:04] <NoNoNo> dinosaadeh: yes, using header() before die();
[08:47:32] <visua> Without moving to store  position()
[08:47:41] <visua> can I still access .top etc?
[08:47:43] <NoNoNo> dinosaadeh: but not very likely :)
[08:47:46] <dinosaadeh> NoNoNo: echo ('success');  return; wont do?
[08:50:37] <mctux> ryanneufeld, sorry
[08:51:19] <mctux> ryanneufeld, im using and implementing jquery-ui tabs demo
[08:51:39] <mctux> ryanneufeld, and tabs object appear very well on my page
[08:51:48] <khmer> $.derp()
[08:52:03] <mctux> ryanneufeld, but just after tabs object appear again full webpage, like a mirror
[08:52:43] <mctux> ryanneufeld, with firebug dont appear html code 2 times, but on visual look, it appear like a mirror
[08:52:44] <ccmonsters> how do I say if a string !contain a substring ..?
[08:53:03] <ccmonsters> curid is the substring I want to look for, and avoid if it's found.
[08:53:26] <dvictor> hello all, quick question. can you link me to a beginner documentation on deferred objects?
[08:53:42] <ccmonsters> just do indexOf on the json string?
[08:54:10] <sisb> Does anyone know why line 43 doesn't populate the table in my code http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/9N4Z
[08:54:58] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @mctux
[08:54:58] <bot-t> mctux, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[08:55:23] <khmer> sisb: your lrow selector seems wrong. do all your IDs end with "td"?
[08:55:33] <mctux> ryanneufeld, what?
[08:55:49] <sisb> khmer, no only the one you can see in tbody in the replaceall
[08:56:09] <ryanneufeld> mctux: I can't see your screen, please replicate your problem on jsfiddle.net so I can physically see it
[08:57:17] <sisb> replaceWith() *
[08:57:25] <mctux> ryanneufeld, ok now i know jsfiddle
[08:57:29] <ze1> Hello
[08:57:33] <mctux> ryanneufeld, im going to replicate there
[08:57:41] <ze1> someone referred to this channel to explain something to me
[08:57:48] <ze1> I think it has been a negative comparison
[08:58:05] <ze1> is that true?
[08:58:22] <ryanneufeld> ze1: you're not making any sense
[08:58:30] <ze1> I'm not?
[08:58:33] <Peaker> surprising that #jquery is larger than all programming language channels on Freenode (apparently)
[08:59:03] <sisb> because jquery is the best programming language
[08:59:04] <ze1> I see
[08:59:05] <ze1> !add
[08:59:05] <sisb> jk
[08:59:58] <black_warlock> what is wrong here http://pastebin.com/S75cLGHp
[09:00:16] <ze1> the language :(
[09:00:17] <black_warlock> i wish to show the preview on the fly inside a div
[09:00:19] <pifantastic> a whole log of things
[09:00:23] <pifantastic> lot*
[09:00:40] <khmer> black_warlock: gosh, a number of things
[09:00:42] <black_warlock> the input field its #descrizione
[09:00:55] <black_warlock> =(
[09:01:18] <black_warlock> the destination dic its box_mid
[09:01:22] <black_warlock> div*
[09:01:52] <pifantastic> black_warlock: this isn't even close to valid jQuery or JavaScript

[09:03:15] <black_warlock> let me try
[09:07:57] <daedeloth> greetings
[09:08:05] <daedeloth> I was wondering, is it possible to check if an element matches a selector?
[09:08:13] <ajpiano> daedeloth: $(elem).is("selector")
[09:08:18] <daedeloth> ok, great, thanks :)
[09:08:56] <daedeloth> so $(elem).is('*') will always return true?
[09:09:09] <Eviltwin> Not true, it will return the same as $('elem')
[09:09:22] <Eviltwin> Where as $('elem').is(':not(*)') will always return $([])
[09:09:26] <Eviltwin> Right, ajpiano?
[09:09:36] <khmer> wrong
[09:09:39] <khmer> .is() returns boolean
[09:09:43] <ajpiano> is re ^^
[09:09:45] <daedeloth> sounds like it should return boolean :p
[09:09:47] <Eviltwin> Sorry, I must be thinking has
[09:09:53] <khmer> you're thinking .filter()
[09:09:54] <Eviltwin> Or filter
[09:13:37] <sorahn> Hey guys, do you know if there is an easy way to have an icon click bring up a select menu?
[09:15:04] <drjones69> sorahn: There's a context menu plugin I've used in the past (http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/09/jquery-context-menu-plugin/) - there may well be newer/better ones by now though, then one can just bind to the appropraite event show it.
[09:15:45] * sorahn reads
[09:16:17] <sorahn> oh, sorry. I meant select as in <select>
[09:16:24] <tomoyuki28jp> What's the difference between e.which from e.keycode?
[09:16:52] <sorahn> I'd like an Icon on a mobile site to bring up the select menu so that I dont' have to code my own, It just uss the one in the iPhone/Android/Whatever
[09:17:10] <ryanneufeld> sorahn: just use an html select
[09:17:11] <drjones69> sorahn: Ah sorry, misunderstood the question.
[09:17:31] <ryanneufeld> sorahn: when the user taps on it, they'll get the native one
[09:17:51] <sorahn> right, but we'd like it to be an icon, instead of a select menu.
[09:18:04] <ryanneufeld> sorahn: then style it
[09:18:31] <sorahn> Can you style the arrow out of a select?  I was trying that earlier, and I wasn't haveing any luck,
[09:24:00] <daed> http://madrobby.github.com/scriptaculous/effect-slideup/ <- does anyone know of an equivalent to this style of .slideUp() in jquery? i.e. where the elements within the div also slide up while hiding?
[09:25:27] <khmer> daed: you can write your own effects and call them with .animate()
[09:25:33] <khmer> daed: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects
[09:25:55] <nFFF> whats wrong with:
[09:25:56] <nFFF>  	jQuery("select option:select").(function() {
[09:25:56] <nFFF> 		jQuery(this).prev("label").addClass("changed");
[09:25:56] <nFFF> 	});
[09:26:09] <nFFF> trying to add a class when an option is selected
[09:26:22] <quicksilver> you're missing the name of the handle
[09:26:25] <quicksilver> handler
[09:26:38] <quicksilver> surely you want .change() or .click() or something.
[09:26:45] <khmer> and also the pseudoclass is :selected, not :select
[09:26:51] <daed> khmer; was hoping to avoid writing my own entire slideUp, but most likely will have to. thanks.
[09:27:16] <khmer> daed: you can probably modify the existing one, just keeping the code side-by-side with the scriptaculous code
[09:29:02] <nFFF> yea sorry, still wont work
[09:29:16] <nFFF>  	jQuery("select option:selected").change(function() {
[09:29:16] <nFFF> 		jQuery(this).prev("label").addClass("changed");
[09:29:16] <nFFF> 	});
[09:29:55] <pifantastic> ?p @ nFFF
[09:29:55] <bot-t> nFFF, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:30:13] <tmayr>  nFFF try select > option:selected
[09:30:34] <pifantastic> nFFF: Don't you want $('select').change() ?
[09:30:56] <pifantastic> I dont think a change event fires for an <option> element
[09:31:03] <tmayr> actually pifantastic is right, on change you want to detect the selected
[09:31:09] <khmer> correct
[09:31:34] <sorahn> ryanneufeld: as far as I can see you can't style a select menu to not look like one.
[09:32:00] <khmer> i'm concerned that you're putting label elements inside selects though
[09:32:17] <Emn1ty> anyone here have experience with FLOT Charts?
[09:33:50] <daed> khmer; looks like jquery UI has what i need via 'slide'
[09:33:58] <khmer> daed: good!
[09:34:00] <daed> er, 'hide' effect 'slide'
[09:34:11] <daed> 'hide' also has several other nice effects.
[09:37:19] <daed> khmer; FWIW this works perfectly identical to the prototype/scriptaculous effects: $("#tabFlash").delay(3000).hide('slide', {direction: 'up'}, 800);
[09:37:29] <khmer> daed: great!
[09:37:46] <daed> i'm slowly trying to get rid of all prototype in this new project :)
[09:40:13] <mctux> ryanneufeld, in jsfiddle is possible put only div html code , true?
[09:40:28] <ryanneufeld> mctux: yeah, you don't need the head, or body tags
[09:40:31] <mctux> ryanneufeld, isnt neccesary insert html body and heads
[09:40:35] <m1chael> anyone have any experience in doing a multi file (photo+video) upload form? id like to utilize html5/state of the art technologies for this.. is there a jquery/mootools thing for this? any suggestions?
[09:40:36] <mctux> ryanneufeld, ok thx
[09:40:48] <pindropper> i've been trying to animate boxshadows. I found out that jquery doesnt support box-shadow animation natively. so i found csshooks. I can't get it to work. any suggestions/ideas anyone?
[09:40:49] <ryanneufeld> mctux: also make sure you select jquery from the libraries on the left.
[09:40:56] <sorahn> ryanneufeld: to re-state my question, can you trigger a select box, from anything that isn't a select box.
[09:41:09] <mctux> ryanneufeld, yeah i choose jquery 1.3.2 and jquery-ui-1.7.2 check selectd
[09:41:18] <ryanneufeld> sorahn: I think you can, I just don't know how
[09:41:26] <ryanneufeld> mctux: why such an old version?
[09:41:31] <mctux> ryanneufeld, onLoad option?
[09:41:41] <ryanneufeld> mctux: whatever the default is should work
[09:42:04] <mctux> ryanneufeld, what is default, onLoad, true?
[09:42:15] <mctux> ryanneufeld, 1.3.2 is our version on moment
[09:42:49] <caddoo> how would i make visible a div if it contains a p inside with class 'active'
[09:42:55] <mctux> ryanneufeld, in Library tag attriburtes, is neccesary write on it?
[09:42:58] <ryanneufeld> mctux: you should update to a newer jquery. Also, onLoad is fine
[09:43:21] <mctux> ryanneufeld, yeah really
[09:43:36] <mctux> ryanneufeld, i need to change all web pages in dev first
[09:43:49] <ryanneufeld> should be able to swap it out
[09:43:52] <mctux> ryanneufeld, and migrate my CMS own first
[09:44:06] <mctux> ryanneufeld, doesnt work
[09:44:15] <mctux> ryanneufeld, in Result appear text plan
[09:44:19] <ThRiX> Hi at all
[09:44:24] <ryanneufeld> mctux: show me
[09:44:24] <mctux> ryanneufeld, without design
[09:44:31] <ryanneufeld> mctux: save it
[09:44:34] <ryanneufeld> and send me the link
[09:44:46] <mctux> ryanneufeld, where is to generate a link
[09:45:16] <ryanneufeld> on the top
[09:45:23] <ryanneufeld> click update or save
[09:46:28] <mctux> ryanneufeld, http://jsfiddle.net/FW8sS/embedded/result/
[09:46:33] <ThRiX> would know someone help me with the plugin autocomplete and json data?
[09:47:01] <mctux> ryanneufeld, in result appear me a rare code, look this: });//]]>
[09:47:07] <ryanneufeld> mctux: you don't need the script tags
[09:47:16] <mctux> ryanneufeld, uhmm
[09:47:35] <ryanneufeld> mctux: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/FW8sS/1/
[09:48:59] <mctux> ryanneufeld, yeah now its works thx
[09:49:07] <ThRiX> iusing the autocomplete plugin with the array data in the script works perfectly, but using the data as json I see all the data without the filter, how can I fix this?
[09:49:07] <mctux> ryanneufeld, but not functional?
[09:49:15] <mctux> ryanneufeld, tabs click dont respond?
[09:50:11] <ryanneufeld> mctux: if you're linking to ids on the same page
[09:50:13] <mctux> ryanneufeld, ok now
[09:50:18] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/FW8sS/3/
[09:50:26] <ryanneufeld> you don't need to put the whole path
[09:50:30] <mctux> ryanneufeld, yeah i quit linkin and now its works! just i doit same thing! ;)
[09:50:46] <mctux> ryanneufeld, oh yeah this is my problem on code cms
[09:50:55] <mctux> ryanneufeld, it generate links bad
[09:51:03] <ryanneufeld> mctux: you were using the whole path, so what was happening was it was dong an ajax call, to load that id
[09:51:16] <ryanneufeld> mctux: so instead of just getting the element, you were getting the whole page
[09:52:25] <mctux> ryanneufeld, now i understand the problem , is for it it appear me like a mirror true?
[09:52:32] <mctux> ryanneufeld, because it load again the page
[09:52:37] <mctux> ryanneufeld, no?
[09:52:45] <PPaul> i'm clicking on a multiselect Jquery plugin and getting this error: elem.nodeName is undefined
[09:52:47] <ryanneufeld> mctux: yes
[09:52:47] <PPaul> any ideas?
[09:53:05] <mctux> ryanneufeld, interesting ;)
[09:53:07] <mctux> ryanneufeld, thx
[09:53:08] <ryanneufeld> PPaul: none based on what you just said
[09:53:12] <PPaul> ok
[09:53:14] <PPaul> :(
[09:53:20] <ryanneufeld> PPaul: paste your code at jsfiddle.net
[09:53:46] <mctux> ryanneufeld, uhm i have in my template tpl this <a href="#tabs-1">
[09:54:01] <mctux> ryanneufeld, but it generate add path
[09:54:22] <mctux> ryanneufeld, now i search in my head to change this way to dont generate with path
[09:54:31] <ryanneufeld> mctux: well I'm not sure what your CMS is doing
[09:55:38] <PPaul> https://gist.github.com/1345664
[09:55:44] <mctux> ryanneufeld, ok thx, i will review it
[09:55:50] <PPaul> line 110
[09:55:55] <PPaul> that's where i make the multiselect
[09:56:11] <PPaul> line 30 is the click handler
[09:57:13] <ryanneufeld> PPaul: that looks like you're using underscore and backbone as well?
[09:57:18] <PPaul> yes
[09:57:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm not familiar with either of those, but my guess is, that you're doing something screwy
[09:57:42] <yedimind> lol
[09:57:46] <ryanneufeld> break out line 110 into more commands
[09:57:48] <PPaul> the multiselect has a global click handler, so i'm not doing that via backbone
[09:57:49] <yedimind> "i dont really know what im talking about, but i think youre doing it wrong"
[09:57:57] <ryanneufeld> yedimind: lol
[09:58:07] <PPaul> my code was working when the click handler was outside of the doc_setup function
[09:58:59] <ryanneufeld> PPaul: sorry man, I can't help you. i don't know backbone. So Im not sure what's happening vs what should be.
[09:59:25] <ryanneufeld> PPaul: start with some console.log()ing of various things as it runs, see if the output is what you expect it to be
[09:59:38] <ryanneufeld> best help I can personally be
[10:00:26] <mctux> ryanneufeld, #tabs-1, the # is neccesary, true?
[10:00:44] <ryanneufeld> mctux: yes, that's how the tabs work
[10:00:46] <ryanneufeld> check the docs
[10:00:50] <ryanneufeld> :)
[10:03:00] <mctux> ryanneufeld, yeah, its true, ok thx a lot
[10:06:43] <mquasar> I'm trying to use $.getScript to load a Ohloh widget, but for some reason the returning js is not being executed
[10:07:33] <mquasar> if I get the response on firebug the result is there, but the contents don't appear on the page, any ideas?
[10:11:22] <jbelcher> Any suggestions for creating an object defined in a .js file that is included multiple times in a page (like in an embed situation)? The object needs to have some members unique to that object.
[10:13:52] <j0llyr0tten> jbelcher: more specificity please
[10:14:56] <cratos> Hello. I've built a wizard flow using the jQuery Form plugin and I have a PHP page which this form POSTs to. However, I'd like to download a file that is the result of processing at the PHP page. What would be the best way to accomplish this?
[10:17:00] <jbelcher> j0llyr0tten: sure, a script file that defines an object is included on a page multiple times. That object definition needs to assign a unique identifier to each object since it's associating itself with a DOM object. The page is also setting up a callback at window scope that will need to locate the correct object from that unique id.
[10:18:42] <devc> if I'm looping through an array with .each(), is there a way to pass a callback once all items have been addressed?
[10:21:15] <ryanneufeld> devc: maybe $.Callbacks in 1.7 would be useful for that
[10:21:40] <ryanneufeld> devc: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[10:22:12] <ryanneufeld> you can define that order matters, so create one function to do .each() and another for the callback
[10:22:25] <devc> ryanneufeld: Woo! That new new.. haha thanks.
[10:29:24] <ryanneufeld> devc: new hotness++
[10:29:57] <Sora_> hiya ppl

[10:32:26] <Pessimism> How do you create the formatting buttons that can, say, turn a text bold, or let the user enter a URL to make a hyperlink?
[10:33:46] <Sora_> ^^;
[10:34:15] * puppen appreciates Sora_'s well formatted smiley
[10:34:21] <devc> ryanneufeld: I'm gonna hit the drawing board first and see if I can find a way around it. I'm intimidated by .callbacks(), not sure it's something I want to try and struggle with learning/picking up.
[10:38:43] <jbelcher> devc: are the actions being performed in the each loop synchronous?
[10:41:36] <devc> jbelcher: I actually don't know the definition of the two -- did a quick Google to be able to answer with certainty but couldn't find anything. Async would be if codes continues being processed while the .each() is going through its items?
[10:41:43] <devc> am I correct?
[10:43:04] <jbelcher> devc: well like ajax calls or animations are asynchronous because they complete some time after the code is initially executed. Synchronous actions do not move to the next instruction until the previous is complete. Most JS is the latter.

[10:48:13] <msekimura> inside of iframe, i'm saving some data by using jQuery.data('foo', 'baz'), but can't get those values from parent window :(
[10:48:36] <jbelcher> msekimura: are the frames on the same domain?
[10:48:40] <msekimura> yep
[10:49:15] <devc> jbelcher: asynchronous then, as the each() is running a function that does further logic.
[10:49:17] <msekimura> i was able to get data if it's defined as html attribute like <span data-foo="baz">foo</span>
[10:50:04] <jbelcher> msekimura: does the child iframe include jquery?
[10:50:13] <jbelcher> devc: not necessarily =). Point being, if you have something like this: $.each(arr, function() { doStuff() }); doAfter();
[10:50:29] <jbelcher> in most cases doAfter() won't be called until each is done.
[10:50:29] <msekimura> jbelcher: yes it does.
[10:52:24] <jbelcher> msekimura:  parent.$.data('foo', 'baz') or top.$.data('foo','baz') from the iframe should work, but you could run into race conditions with having the dom available if you're not careful
[10:53:42] <msekimura> jbelcher: so, I have to save data on parent window rather than child window which has those elements?
[10:53:43] <hkhalid> anyone here good with jquery cycle? I tried making a link when clicked it goes to a specific slide but nothing is happening
[10:54:27] <msekimura> ah. now i c what you're saying..
[10:54:54] <jbelcher> msekimura: from the iframe, $ refers to its version of jQuery and parent/top.$ refers to its parent window's jQuery. To access DOM elements in the parent window you need to either use its jQuery or pass jQuery a different document object
[10:55:28] <msekimura> jbelcher: ok. I'm gonna try it. thank you!
[10:55:34] <devc> jbelcher: damn. You're right... so that resolved my issue. It was my misunderstanding where the 'bug' existed. :)
[10:56:30] <jbelcher> devc: yeah outside of a few special conditions (timeouts, ajax, animations) JS won't proceed forward in execution until the previous action completes.
[10:56:46] <devc> jbelcher: okay great. Thanks.
[11:02:14] <pindropper> i've been trying to animate boxshadows. I found out that jquery doesnt support box-shadow animation natively. so i found csshooks. I can't get it to work. any suggestions/ideas anyone?

[11:03:05] <pindropper> Jon47: that sounds promising. dont know what it is. will look. thanks.
[11:08:21] <mctux> ryanneufeld, one question, from href is possible to call another js?
[11:08:43] <ryanneufeld> mctux: another js what?
[11:10:35] <mctux> ryanneufeld, i need show dinamic content inside tab, generating it from js
[11:10:53] <ryanneufeld> mctux: you can use ajax for that
[11:10:55] <mctux> ryanneufeld, it is to integrate javascript api google analytics inside the tabs, basic
[11:11:05] <ryanneufeld> instead of the #tab-2 you just put the url
[11:11:20] <ColKurtz> mctux yes, you can get an external javascript file and execute it.
[11:11:49] <ColKurtz> mctux, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[11:12:03] <mctux> ryanneufeld, i see, yeah but problem is if i put absolute path in href
[11:12:11] <mctux> ryanseddon, where is my cms to search
[11:13:54] <mctux> ColKurtz, ok getscript , is nice, thx
[11:15:05] <tsutton> Hi all—I'm trying to extend the fixed/floating element thing.  I want to put the Site Title above the menu:   http://jsfiddle.net/saltcod/NwFc9/
[11:15:37] <tsutton> But it keeps printing Site Title Site Title Site Title  every time I scroll.
[11:15:54] <tsutton> Is there a way to have it print only once?   to achieve this effect:     http://cl.ly/0d0g3D3J3c2I1f0Y1d2c
[11:18:56] <mctux> ColKurtz, but is possible differents call , call js for a tab, call another js for another tab
[11:19:14] <ColKurtz> wat
[11:19:15] <mctux> ColKurtz, with getscript
[11:20:00] <ColKurtz> $('#tab1').click(function(){ $.getScript('tab1.js'); }); $('#tab2').click(function(){ $.getScript('tab2.js'); }); etc.
[11:21:00] <Daman> $.ajax() with a datatype of jsonp appends the url with &_= followed by a pretty long number(looks sort of like unix time), what is that?
[11:21:21] <BCarlyon> Cache killer.
[11:21:37] <Daman> is it just a random number or...
[11:21:37] <mctux> ColKurtz, oh thx
[11:21:57] <BCarlyon> Daman: I believe its random and linked to the current time in microseconds.
[11:22:04] <Daman> ah, alright, thanks

[11:26:22] <alaing> Hi I 'm having difficulty loading in jquery
[11:26:27] <alaing> this is my link <link href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js" type="text/javascript"/>
[11:26:57] <paul___> hey, anyone know why a div on which i call $().draggable(), is jumps in position when i begin to drag it?
[11:27:04] <paul___> is jumping *
[11:27:14] <paul___> no margins, etc are applied to it
[11:27:30] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: did it get a fright?
[11:27:50] <paul___> j0llyr0tten it's only running from a mouse ;)
[11:27:51] <tmayr> alaing <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js"></script>
[11:28:04] <dbe> Hey guys, I'm tracking seperate events for clicking a checkbox, and clicking a label. However when I click on the label, it triggers a click event on the checkbox as well. Is there a way inside of the checkbox click event that I can see what the source was?
[11:28:32] <j0llyr0tten> can you paste the code and css somewhere?
[11:28:48] <mctux> ColKurtz, but $('#tab1').click(function(){ $.getScript('tab1.js'); });
[11:28:53] * alaing is feeling a bit embaressed
[11:29:03] <paul___> j0llyr0tten would have to make a sample project
[11:29:09] <mctux> ColKurtz, is possible to put in href directly? to dont use another js
[11:29:19] <paul___> j0llyr0tten I'll try that next if I can't figure this out.. thx :)
[11:29:19] <alaing> thank tmayr completely forgot js should be in script tags not link tags
[11:29:23] <mctux> ColKurtz, the getscript call
[11:29:25] <tmayr> dont worry :P
[11:29:27] <ColKurtz> wut
[11:29:29] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: obviously should not be happening ... is it near the end of the screen, or near another object? or do you have 'snap' defined?
[11:29:40] <Cira> so, I'm having an interesting problem... I am using galleria and lavalamp on my site, both of which require jquery + easing.... Problem seems to be that they are made for different versions of jquery/easing and I can't get both of them to work together on the same web page
[11:29:51] <Cira> does anyone know a workaround?
[11:30:04] <sc30317> hey all, quick question:  I want to add a form so that I can submit the dates used in this jQuery example: http://pastebin.com/myZp76Vm and run a .php script I wrote.  Where would I add the form field?
[11:30:10] <paul___> j0llyr0tten I'm just going like this http://d.pr/2z4c
[11:30:41] <paul___> j0llyr0tten styled like this http://d.pr/zExV
[11:31:00] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: "grid" .... Snaps the dragging helper to a grid, every x and y pixels. Array values: [x, y]
[11:31:04] <paul___> (that's stylus btw - compiles to css)
[11:31:08] <paul___> yeah
[11:31:13] <paul___> but that's not what's causing it
[11:31:19] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: yes it is
[11:31:37] <paul___> then why did it happen before i even found that param to draggable?
[11:31:49] <paul___> is it on by default?
[11:32:31] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: are you super super sure? :)
[11:32:37] <paul___> yessir
[11:32:38] <j0llyr0tten> paul___: remove it and re-check :)
[11:33:09] <paul___> yep still happens
[11:33:12] <paul___> and it's not just a jump either
[11:33:16] <j0llyr0tten> hmmmm
[11:33:17] <paul___> it's dragging at some kind of offset from the cursor
[11:33:19] <paul___> just found this, maybe related http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/2964
[11:33:57] <paul___> figured it out
[11:33:58] <paul___> that was it!
[11:34:07] <j0llyr0tten> oh yes? tell me, what?!
[11:34:11] <paul___> so, apparently putting a border is a no-no
[11:34:23] <paul___> i also had an animation on the border
[11:34:28] <paul___> so it looked extra strange
[11:34:42] <paul___> (border activated on hover)
[11:35:08] <j0llyr0tten> really? ... maybe try to wrap the thing in another div and set the wrapped div to draggable and see if that works
[11:35:24] <paul___> that's a good idea
[11:35:28] <paul___> thx :)
[11:36:21] <j0llyr0tten> ok, i've seen that mentioned in the docs a few times for getting around niggly problems, mightn't work in your case mind you but can't hurt to try
[11:36:55] <j0llyr0tten> strange that border does that, you should create a ticket with the code and css that makes it happen
[11:37:06] <paul___> kk
[11:42:00] <moura> how can i stop a script of responding to events while is doing an effect?
[11:42:02] <paul___> hey j0llyr0tten, i was wrong about that
[11:42:09] <paul___> it turns out that it was cause i had a scale applied to it
[11:42:25] <paul___> http://d.pr/hhbH
[11:42:43] <pifantastic> moura: Perhaps look into queue()

[11:51:59] <dandaman_> hi all
[11:52:32] <dandaman_> I have a multiple select list and if i select 2 items at a time, how do i get both their indexes in an array or any other storage method?
[11:53:49] <BCarlyon> dandaman: : try .serialize on the selector
[11:53:52] <gar_onn> .value ...
[11:54:17] <dandaman_> k, lemme try serialize
[11:55:59] <dandaman_> BCarlyon: serialiez will give me the values, not the indexes
[11:56:26] <sublimenal> Hi there, I'm wondering if its at all possible to loop through the area element of an image map. Get the coordinates of that "area" then create a overlaying box with those coordinates
[11:58:43] <kollapse> Hi. Someone please run "if ($.browser.safari) { alert("Safari!!"); }" on a Chrome browser and comfirm that it alerts.
[11:58:59] <Axcy> Hello, I've got the quite simple -> <a href="#" onclick="collapse_div('fulldescription')"> in my php code, now I can't seem to figure out how to do this with jquery, as ;<a href="#" onclick="$('fulldescription').show();"> doesn't seem to work :/
[11:58:59] <kollapse> Strangely, $.browser treats Chrome as Safari.
[11:59:05] <sublimenal> I have gotten this far  (booths 1-8)  http://72.52.186.25/wp-content/plugins/mmis/test.html  I just need to find a way to make those boxes
[12:00:09] <j0llyr0tten> stupid question, how do i get the tag name from a jQuery object? so if i passed in an object to a function ...
[12:00:51] <sc30317> how can I use jQuery date picker values in a form?
[12:01:22] <Cheery> could there be a way to simulate set data structure in pygame?
[12:01:29] <Cheery> argh. jquery
[12:03:31] <JAAulde> Ok, I haven't abstracted out a test scenario yet, but before I do has anyone ever seen fullCalendar render the calendar toolbar, but not the actual calendar, when called? If I click a button in the toolbar, the calendar will then show up...so weird...
[12:03:38] <JAAulde> I use this plugin a lot and have never seen such a thing
[12:04:35] <supsup> sup

[12:07:14] <Funhouse> Hi everyone I have an animation sequence that uses setTimeout, when switch tabs in FF it pauses the animation, I then found the solution here --> http://api.jquery.com/animate/#notes-0
[12:07:23] <Funhouse> My question is, where do I use .queue?
[12:09:56] <pifantastic> Funhouse: that sounds like the opposite of what should happen.  Using setTimeout/setInterval, your animation will continue when the FF tab changes
[12:10:06] <pifantastic> however, if you use requestAnimationFrame, it will pause the animation
[12:11:47] <Funhouse> pifantastic, hmm ok i dont request it anywhere
[12:12:04] <Funhouse> is it better to use .queue() for an animation sequence?
[12:12:43] <pifantastic> Funhouse: Yes, because the browser can optimize the animation so that it doesn't run when a user switches tabs
[12:13:01] <tjh> Error: Unknown system errno 3 kill
[12:13:02] <tjh> :(
[12:13:08] <Funhouse> pifantastic, ok great will use that thank you
[12:14:43] <poppiez> hi guys, is there any way to do lazy loading of images with graceful degradation? I've tried almost everything to avoid images being loaded. replaced the src attrib with "", emptied the body etc. with no luck
[12:16:16] <sublimenal> Does anyone know if you can create a div based on the coordinates of an image map "area" ?
[12:17:01] <poppiez> sublimenal: you can't draw a div as a polygon for example
[12:17:06] <poppiez> squares, you can, of course
[12:17:59] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, help me please: why this script does nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/YKezq/3/
[12:18:19] <sublimenal> ah ok, im working with squares and horizontal squares  http://72.52.186.25/wp-content/plugins/mmis/test.html   just want to highlight some of the boxes
[12:20:40] <Primer> Anyone use jquery to dynamically load the google maps API? i.e. $.ajax { jsonp...} ?
[12:21:09] <Primer> I'm getting this: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'jQuery15107656295886263251_1320697112582' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[12:21:46] <pifantastic> Primer: that means you are trying to use jQuery to make a JSONP request, but the request is probably not actually JSONP
[12:21:55] <Primer> This method is it called from google's own code, it seems, and
[12:21:59] <pifantastic> meaning, the response JSON is not wrapped in a callback
[12:22:14] <Primer> yeah, exactly. It's not simply appended to the content, or wrapped in it
[12:22:36] <pifantastic> Primer: are you including a "callback=?
[12:22:41] <pifantastic>  in the URL of your request?
[12:22:44] <Primer> no
[12:22:52] <pifantastic> ?getJSON
[12:22:53] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[12:22:54] <Primer> jquery's supposed to do that, is it now?
[12:23:01] <Primer> err, not, that is
[12:23:13] <pifantastic> "If the URL includes the string "callback=?" (or similar, as defined by the server-side API), the request is treated as JSONP instead. See the discussion of the jsonp data type in $.ajax() for more details."
[12:23:25] <Primer> $.ajax { c: 'callback', type: 'jsonp', ... }
[12:23:51] <pifantastic> ?p @ Primer
[12:23:51] <sorrymyeng> guys, anyone
[12:23:51] <bot-t> Primer, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:23:54] <Primer> is that not equivalent?
[12:23:56] <sorrymyeng>  help me please: why this script does nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/YKezq/3/
[12:24:08] <supsup> sorrymyeng:  http://jsfiddle.net/KgfFg/
[12:24:12] <supsup> your setting itu p wrong
[12:24:57] <Primer> Seems I have no way out of this...I want the callback to execute an object method

[12:25:32] <monokrome> Is there a reason why jQuery wouldn't be able to animate 'background-position-x'?
[12:25:41] <Primer> yes, yes, doing so now
[12:27:06] <razzi> monokrome, afaik there is no such property
[12:27:31] <razzi> monokrome, also afaik only ie supports it
[12:27:32] <supsup> ? background-position-x
[12:27:35] <bot-t> supsup, #9621 (animate of backgroundPositionX and backgroundPositionY ... - Opened 5 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9621
[12:27:46] <monokrome> It's been working for me in Chrome.
[12:27:58] <monokrome> (Just not jQuery animating it)
[12:28:07] <avar> Is there a way to incrementally load a large text or json file from a URL with jQuery, it seems like the .load() etc. APIs give you a callback with the whole file
[12:28:18] <avar> I'm wanting to load something large for inserting into a html5-sql db
[12:28:19] <monokrome> Is there a way to animate the background position with jQuery? :/
[12:28:46] <razzi> monokrome, it seem you need to use a plugin
[12:29:22] <monokrome> hmm
[12:29:45] <sorrymyeng> supsup: how did you added jquery.form.js as resource?
[12:30:16] <bot-t> monokrome, http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery-bg-image-animations
[12:30:26] <Primer> jsfiddle hates me...can it not handle object.prototype notation?
[12:30:38] <Cira> I'm at my wits' end.... In trying to make lavaLamp and galleria work together, I manged to find a jquery version that doesnt raise any errors (1.5.2) but now lavaLamp isn't working... Can anyone help me?
[12:30:55] <supsup> Primer make sure you rpicking jquery in the left hand options
[12:31:03] <Primer> js console throwing errors
[12:31:07] <monokrome> jQuery knows how to animate the "(0 0)" format?
[12:31:08] <Primer> supsup: I did
[12:31:09] <supsup> sorrymyeng: left side options
[12:31:10] <j0llyr0tten> hey, so like i said, probably a moronic question, but if i have a jQ object and i want to get the html tag is there a way to do it?
[12:31:48] <j0llyr0tten> so $('<div></div>').? would give me back 'div'
[12:32:00] <Primer> supsup: http://jsfiddle.net/8fdnp/3/
[12:32:16] <Primer> perhaps you can tell me what's wrong
[12:32:19] <Primer> oh
[12:32:20] <Primer> nm
[12:32:45] <sorrymyeng> supsup: thank you very much:)
[12:32:54] <Cira> the site where I have this setup is tomislavsivic.com (where lavaLamp works with jquery 1.6.4.) and tomislavsivic.com/gallery.html where galleria works with jquery 1.5.2 but lavaLamp doesnt (yet doesnt raise any errors)
[12:32:57] <Primer> it was missing a }
[12:33:35] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/8fdnp/5/
[12:33:36] <supsup> yep
[12:34:04] <supsup> some other problem there also
[12:34:32] <Primer> http://jsfiddle.net/8fdnp/6/
[12:35:20] <Primer> so yeah, it seems that google's map API doesn't wrap that in a callback, but it does call the callback
[12:35:54] <Primer> otherwise why would the js console report that there's no such function?
[12:37:14] <supsup> think it has to do with the way your using the jsonp method.
[12:39:10] <Emn1ty> anyone here any good with the FLOT api?
[12:39:21] <Sora_> Primer: try with http://jsfiddle.net/echo/jsonp/ for jsonp
[12:39:29] <Sora_> in the url
[12:39:33] <Primer> Looking at the trace for the error, it shows google.maps.Load in the trace
[12:40:00] <Primer> Sora_: seems jsfiddle is working just fine for my example
[12:40:39] <Primer> just wondering why the callback is not defined when it's called
[12:42:14] <Primer> My understanding is that as long as it's being called, it should work, regardless of wrapping code or data in the callback (&callback=foo becomes foo("the data")) or it just calls the callback directly (&callback=foo becomes foo(); at the end of the returned page)
[12:44:04] <supsup> yah i don't know i don't even see the request going out. sorry afkz
[12:45:23] <Primer> the request is definitely going out
[12:45:47] <Primer> I see it in the network tab of chrome developer
[12:45:50] <sorrymyeng> supsup: why script can die on second string: http://jsfiddle.net/VtRg7/ ("1" is alertnig on my page, but "2" dont) the whole page is very big and i need an idea for debug
[12:46:10] <Primer> with the callback parameter attached, as expected
[12:46:16] <Eviltwin> sorrymyeng: "validate" is not defined
[12:46:24] <Primer> and I see the callback in the returned code, and it's being called
[12:46:27] <Primer> yet, it just doesn't exist
[12:46:36] <supsup> sorrymyeng u have to have jquery reff in left side
[12:46:39] <Eviltwin> Neither is $.fn.ajaxForm
[12:46:43] <Sora_> is jsonpCallback: 'callback'
[12:46:48] <danzik17> Primer: it's because that call is uding the wrong parameter.  dataType should be type
[12:46:51] <danzik17> using*
[12:46:54] <supsup> and yah u also need ajaxform ref
[12:46:57] <supsup> in external refrences
[12:47:12] <danzik17> whoops n/m, im on drugs.
[12:47:16] <Primer> hrmm
[12:47:31] <Sora_> Primer is jsonpCallback: 'function'
[12:47:37] <sorrymyeng> supsup: im talking about real page, not your tester
[12:49:50] <Primer> danzik17: seems that's not the case
[12:50:13] <danzik17> Primer: yea i realized that about 1.23 seconds after i hit enter :(
[12:50:40] <Primer> I'm using this exact same call against a server side script that I control
[12:50:41] <supsup> sorrymyeng, what is link. the one u listed is set to MooTools
[12:50:47] <supsup> and no refrence to ajaxForm
[12:51:11] <Primer> but in the script I just append the callback to the output with "()" at the end
[12:51:18] <sorrymyeng> Eviltwin: nope, it is not the reason, other ideas? i use noConflict, and that why im use: jQuery(function($) {    alert(1);    $('#addReviewForm').ajaxForm( { beforeSubmit: validate } );    alert(2); }); is it correct?
[12:51:48] <supsup> u would need something like:  var validate = function(){//doworkson}
[12:52:29] <supsup> sorrymyeng i suggest you learn how to use jsfiddle.net better.
[12:52:35] <Qphp> Hello, I've a some tables rows, I access each row like: #id tr:eq(1), #id tr:eq(2), #id tr:eq(3).... and so on... is it possible to know that "3" is the last index?
[12:53:37] <supsup> $("#id tr").length ?
[12:53:39] <poppiez> is there any way to lazy an image in JS that actually works? if you have an image like this: <img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200/"> I can't do anything to prevent it from loading. tried to replace the src attribute, empty the body etc. with no luck
[12:53:53] <ajpiano> Qphp: $("someElem").is(":last-child") will return true if it is the last element in its parent
[12:54:11] <Qphp> Thanks i'll try it
[12:54:21] <Primer> Anyhow, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong here
[12:55:00] <Primer> Yet, chrome's developer console stops execution when it tries to call the callback, because it doesn't exist
[12:55:10] <sorrymyeng> supsup: i write in like in that working example...  http://jsfiddle.net/KgfFg/ and i can not give you a link to page - its in localhost
[12:55:51] <Primer> I can see that the callback is attached to the request: http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&callback=jQuery17049455526378005743_1320699205639&_=1320699205641
[12:55:52] <supsup> sorry sorrymyeng not sure what u mean at all.
[12:56:29] <Primer> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'jQuery17049455526378005743_1320699205639' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[12:56:41] <Primer> Note the names match
[12:56:47] <supsup> sorrymyeng u see how validate is defined?  therefore ajaxForm beforeSubmit object method can use it
[12:56:56] <supsup> function validate is defined so it can use it
[12:57:01] <supsup> if you dont' define it, then it's undefined
[12:58:10] <supsup> make sure on your local host to add back the real refences to jquery and the document.ready method back around your ajaxForm call
[12:58:24] <supsup> u don't use those on jsfiddle (well it does it for u) but on your local machine you need them
[13:00:01] <supsup> sorrymyeng:  here is with onload jsfiddle turned off...so u can copy this one exactly http://jsfiddle.net/KgfFg/3/
[13:05:29] <aglemann> question about global eval (jquery 1.5.1).. have a page with some 3rd party ad script tags... i'd like to move the content (flash videos) created by the script tags into another node on the page.. but when i append the content, jquery evals those script tags (again) in the head of the document, which replaces all the content on the page with the flash video (took me a while to figure out what was going on)
[13:06:03] <aglemann> so my question is, what's the best approach? i guess i should be able to just filter the script tags before appending the content, but just want to check if there isn't a better approach?
[13:06:14] <poppiez> is there any way to lazy an image in JS that actually works? if you have an image like this: <img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200/"> I can't do anything to prevent it from loading. tried to replace the src attribute, empty the body etc. with no luck
[13:07:03] <sorrymyeng> supsup: thank you, i will think about it tomorrow - it is 4:00
[13:07:41] <Eviltwin> poppiez: If the <img> is in the source, you have very little control
[13:07:51] <Eviltwin> Especially in older browsers
[13:08:48] <poppiez> damn
[13:09:04] <Eviltwin> Why do you need it?
[13:09:10] <a9il> hello..
[13:11:11] <a9il> how can we know what passable string in .hide() I can use .hide('slide') but this's undocumented...
[13:11:44] <a9il> !help
[13:11:54] <supsup> poppiez have u tried doing a loop over all images and finding the one that has that src value and then removing it from dom?
[13:12:12] <poppiez> Eviltwin: I'm creating a slideshow with graceful degradation. so google, and browsers with no JS enabled will see the images. so what I wanted to do is create a richer experience when JS is present by preventing all the images from loading and then turn it into a slideshow
[13:12:25] <poppiez> supsup: yes
[13:12:34] <poppiez> supsup: they've already started loading by that point
[13:13:42] <Eviltwin> poppiez: I believe most browsers will try to load in DOM order
[13:13:49] <Eviltwin> Or in parallel
[13:14:06] <Eviltwin> Nothing's too standard about it though
[13:14:17] <supsup> poppiez what about just hiding it?
[13:14:24] <poppiez> yeah, guess I have to forget about it working
[13:15:26] <poppiez> supsup: hide what?
[13:15:33] <supsup> the image ?
[13:15:40] <supsup> via css
[13:16:07] <poppiez> it still loads even though it's hidden
[13:16:23] <supsup> why do u care if it loads tho just speed?
[13:18:17] <Eviltwin> $(document).ready(function(){...}); runs the code on the DOMContentLoaded event
[13:18:20] <Eviltwin> Before any of the images load
[13:18:33] <Eviltwin> However the browser may *begin* loading them by that point
[13:18:43] <Eviltwin> Your code will still run before they load though
[13:20:20] <supsup> u mgiht be able to abuse the onerror event of the image. by making the image src's invalid, then in the onerror parse the bad src and fix it for some cases, and in others remove from dom
[13:21:06] <supsup> i.e, force 404s but off by 1 char like ~~/images/...
[13:21:26] <supsup> onerror can catch the case where u don't want to draw them and the case where u do
[13:21:51] <supsup> and strip off the ~~ if u want them to draw and remove them if u don't
[13:21:58] <supsup> anyway just an idea prob won't work lol
[13:22:34] <Tobbe> quick question: what is the difference between .on("click"... and .click(... ?
[13:22:54] <context> on() delegates doesnt it
[13:23:11] <Tobbe> what does that mean?
[13:23:45] <supsup> ? .on
[13:23:49] <bot-t> supsup, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:23:50] <Eviltwin> context: It doesn't always
[13:24:02] <Eviltwin> .on() is a replacement for .bind() and .delegate() I believe
[13:24:06] <Tobbe> ? .click
[13:24:06] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[13:24:27] <Tobbe> see, that doesn't really tell me what the difference is... (the bot-t answers)
[13:24:36] <Eviltwin> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[13:24:36] <supsup> u see that link
[13:24:38] <supsup> at the end?
[13:24:42] <supsup> u gotta go read it
[13:24:46] <supsup> both of them ~~
[13:25:02] <Eviltwin> "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method provides all functionality required for attaching event handlers. For equivalents to older jQuery event methods, see .bind(), .delegate(), and .live()."
[13:25:45] <Tobbe> I googled for the difference between .live("click", .... and .click(... but that didn't give me any usefull answers either
[13:25:59] <Tobbe> since .on is the new .live I take it
[13:26:03] <Eviltwin> There's actually quite a difference
[13:26:03] <ajpiano> Tobbe: .click is a shorthand for .bind("click", fn)
[13:26:07] <Eviltwin> Between .live and .click
[13:26:36] <Eviltwin> $("a").click(function(){...}) vs $("a").live(function(){...})
[13:27:02] <Eviltwin> .live will make it apply to all future <a> tags
[13:27:09] <Eviltwin> .click will make it apply to only the current <a> tags
[13:27:17] <Eviltwin> It will also bind separately to each of them
[13:27:27] <Eviltwin> Time consuming and slow if there are a lot of them
[13:27:46] <Tobbe> "separately". What practical difference does that make?
[13:27:51] <Jon47> Tobbe .live delegates the click event on elements matching that selector to the document itself, so any future elements (as long as they are within the document, natch) will continue to bubble up and get caught by that handler
[13:28:24] <Eviltwin> Tobbe: It means it goes through each element in that collection and does some work to it
[13:28:29] <moo-> can i use keypress on elements that are not <input> ?
[13:28:35] <moo-> i want keypress on a table
[13:28:37] <Eviltwin> This is not the case with .live
[13:28:53] <Eviltwin> moo-: Technically I think you want to bind to $(window) for all key actions
[13:28:58] <ambackstrom> Can I use jQuery (or straight JavaScript) to observe all events happening on an element? I want more insight into what is happening when certain actions are performed (like the "X" clear button on input[type=search])
[13:29:25] <moo-> Eviltwin, i dont want to capture keys inside all elements, just a table and its tr and td
[13:29:27] <Tobbe> Eviltwin: so .live is faster?
[13:29:39] <Tobbe> is there any downside to using .live (and .on)
[13:29:42] <Tobbe> ?
[13:29:48] <Eviltwin> ambackstrom: No, but you can do $("element").bind("click keyup ...",function(e){...})
[13:29:56] <Eviltwin> For all the ones you're interested in
[13:30:08] <Eviltwin> Tobbe: Yes but they still mean different things
[13:30:26] <Eviltwin> moo-: I don't think the key events bubble normally
[13:30:33] <Eviltwin> I think it's generally faked based on focus
[13:30:40] <minna1> Im trying to use .load to update a div, but load will load the div inside itself, how can i just update the div?
[13:30:43] <ajpiano> Tobbe: you should prefer .on to .delegate to .live
[13:30:51] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: key events bubble
[13:31:12] <moo-> ajpiano, so how can i capture keypress events inside a table?
[13:31:14] <ajpiano> we only have to fake it for blur, focus, submit, change, iirc
[13:31:43] <ajpiano> moo-:  $("table").on("keypress", function() { }); should do the trick
[13:31:54] <moo-> ajpiano, thanks,i check
[13:32:19] <Tobbe> ajpiano: yes, that much I gathered :) question was what the difference was between .on("click" and .click. But now I understand that .on will also match future elements, and is faster than .click. So .on seems to always be the better choice
[13:32:53] <Eviltwin> Huh
[13:32:54] <Eviltwin> So it does
[13:32:54] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/w2u2a/
[13:32:57] <ajpiano> sort of
[13:32:58] <danzik17> Tobbe: not quite.  on('click', function()...) === click(function()...)
[13:33:08] <danzik17> If you provide the optional selector, then it's different
[13:33:10] <ambackstrom> Eviltwin: Alrighty, thank you.
[13:33:54] <Tobbe> danzik17: interesting, that's not what I have been told before :)
[13:34:35] <moo-> ajpiano, does not seem to work
[13:34:40] <Eviltwin> Tobbe: .live, .bind, .delegate, and .click (etc) are all now passed through .on
[13:34:55] <Eviltwin> It's now just another syntax for some call to .on
[13:35:10] <salientKnight> hey all
[13:35:21] <moo-> Eviltwin, should i use .live, .bind, .delegate, and .click when i know what i want, or should i just always use .on() ?
[13:35:23] <danzik17> Tobbe: just read the source if you want to confirm.  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L958-L980
[13:35:28] <ajpiano> moo-: i think actually $("table").on("keypress", "input", function(e) { }); might be what you're after
[13:35:37] <salientKnight> I'm having a problem adding content to a div can anyone help?
[13:35:38] <minna1> nevermind, i figured it out
[13:35:40] <Eviltwin> moo-: If you want to support pre-1.7, use .live, .bind, .delegate, or .click
[13:35:41] <Tobbe> aha! so .click will *also* match future elements?
[13:35:59] <ajpiano> Tobbe: no , .click never matches "future elements'
[13:36:07] <salientKnight> I have tried .html() and append() and appendto()
[13:36:08] <Eviltwin> moo-: After 1.7, there's no good reason to use .live, .bind, or .delegate
[13:36:20] <Eviltwin> moo-: But .click is still shorter than .on("click",
[13:36:30] <Eviltwin> So that's one argument for still using those
[13:36:35] <salientKnight> I am just trying to achieve an innerHtml effect
[13:36:50] <supsup> why not just use .bind tho! i like bind best of all it's my fav
[13:36:54] <Eviltwin> supsup: What's the problem?
[13:36:55] <moo-> ajpiano, that does not seem to work either
[13:37:00] <ajpiano> salientKnight: .html(htmlstring); works, i promise
[13:37:06] <Eviltwin> supsup: .on is a replacement for .bind and is more feature rich
[13:37:16] <supsup> i still use jquery 1.6.4 tho yo
[13:37:17] <ajpiano> supsup: because we don't decide on things based on sentimentality, lol
[13:37:27] <salientKnight> ajpiano, not working for me
[13:37:35] <ajpiano> salientKnight: make a test case, i promise it works
[13:37:39] <Tobbe> ajpiano: $("a").on("click", function() {...   <-- will that function be executed when I click a-elements I create later on?
[13:37:41] <ajpiano> otherwise you wouldn't be the first person to discover it works
[13:37:44] <salientKnight> I can get the string in an alert but not into that div
[13:37:52] <ajpiano> salientKnight: is the html valid
[13:38:03] <salientKnight> yeah does it need to have a place holder it in?
[13:38:05] <salientKnight> in it?
[13:38:36] <ajpiano> what placeholder are you talking about?
[13:38:47] <salientKnight> I was asking you
[13:38:51] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: What's the .innerHTML equivalent?
[13:38:52] <Eviltwin> Show us
[13:39:02] <Eviltwin> And show us your jQuery that's not working
[13:39:07] <moo-> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/NcMgm/
[13:39:09] <moo-> does not work
[13:39:14] <Eviltwin> If they're more than a line each, paste it somewhere and link us
[13:39:26] <Eviltwin> moo-: ...
[13:39:33] <Eviltwin> How can text receive a key event?
[13:39:38] <salientKnight> getByID('shipto').innerHtml="sample";
[13:39:56] <ajpiano> moo-: yeah, what Eviltwin just asked :p
[13:39:58] <moo-> Eviltwin, yeah, i want capture keypress without have a <input>
[13:40:09] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/NcMgm/1/
[13:40:12] <supsup> moo: http://jsfiddle.net/NcMgm/1/ ?
[13:40:14] <salientKnight> and I tried $('div.shipto').html("sample");
[13:40:25] <supsup> moo: o nm
[13:40:32] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: 'Cause that's a div with *CLASS* shipto
[13:40:35] <salientKnight> and $("#shipto")
[13:40:41] <moo-> supsup, i dont want any <input>
[13:41:00] <ajpiano> moo-: you can't capture keypresses on nothing though
[13:41:01] <supsup> yah i get it, i should just ignore all this .on talk anyway 1.6.4 is best jquery ever.
[13:41:08] <salientKnight> I tried it as a class and an id
[13:41:09] <ajpiano> you can *catch* them at higher level in the dom
[13:41:28] <Eviltwin> moo-: How do you know where they are typing if they're not focused on an input?
[13:41:31] <moo-> ajpiano, but i awnt capture keypress on table
[13:41:33] <ajpiano> moo-: only focusable things can have keypresses
[13:41:46] <moo-> Eviltwin, well i can capture on 'html' selector
[13:41:58] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: http://jsfiddle.net/JrdVg/
[13:42:15] <Eviltwin> moo-: You can capture a "global" keypress
[13:42:21] <moo-> Eviltwin, yeah
[13:42:21] <Eviltwin> But in that case it's not targeted at any particular element
[13:42:32] <salientKnight> Eviltwin, tried that...
[13:42:34] <moo-> Eviltwin, well i cant capture keypresses only when table is selected
[13:42:39] <moo-> like table is focused
[13:42:45] <supsup> moo: make it every 8th keypress display an annoying blinking rumbling thing
[13:42:46] <Eviltwin> Tables can't be focused...
[13:43:03] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: Dude, it works in the jsFiddle I just sent you
[13:43:07] <Eviltwin> It's not a jQuery problem
[13:43:09] <Eviltwin> It's your problem
[13:43:14] <Eviltwin> You must be doing something wrong somewhere
[13:43:20] <salientKnight> I see that it works there
[13:43:20] <Eviltwin> Which is why we've been asking to see a paste of your code
[13:43:33] <ajpiano> Tobbe: i believe your code will only affect current elements
[13:43:35] <salientKnight> for me, the var outputs to an alert box but not to the div
[13:44:16] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: Please paste your code into pastebin and link us or make a jsFiddle illustrating your problem and link us
[13:44:18] <ajpiano> Tobbe: $(document).on("click", "a", function() { }) is how you'd emulate live()
[13:45:09] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: The only difference between .live and .delegate is the context to which it binds, right?
[13:45:21] <ajpiano> pretty much
[13:45:24] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: .live catches it at the top of the document
[13:45:26] <ajpiano> live also makes a superfluous selection
[13:45:32] <supsup> ajpiano do u really watch football man i see ur twitters poppin off on football and i just shake my head a lot.
[13:45:32] <ajpiano> attempts to make ^^
[13:45:42] <ajpiano> supsup: yes i am a huge jets fan since 20 years
[13:46:11] <moo-> seems its possible http://jsfiddle.net/hKZqS/14/
[13:46:12] <ajpiano> i'm sorry if that ruins twitter for you
[13:46:14] <supsup> heh. thats hardcore
[13:47:05] <supsup> it does they should have a filter to not ignore people tweets but any with certain phrases in them
[13:47:13] <salientKnight> http://pastebin.com/1nix8Euw
[13:47:30] <Tobbe> ajpiano: Thanks!
[13:47:51] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: You don't have the quotes.....
[13:48:03] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: You have $(#shipto) and you need $("#shipto")
[13:48:05] <Eviltwin> That's a huge difference
[13:48:25] <salientKnight> I had them before... jas let me check again
[13:48:25] <supsup> heh, yah and that's soem sweet spacing there
[13:48:29] <Eviltwin> $(#shipto) doesn't compile
[13:48:30] <ajpiano> supsup: many would argue that the point of twitter is to appreciate the full spectrum of a person's personality even though you were only interested in them initially for a particular reason
[13:48:50] <ajpiano> when you get mad at someone for being "off-topic" on their own life
[13:48:58] <ajpiano> it just makes for sad kitties
[13:49:01] <supsup> i don't get mad at anything yo ~~
[13:49:06] <supsup> i was just joshin u
[13:49:06] <ajpiano> haha im jking
[13:49:10] <salientKnight> yeah nothing
[13:49:12] <ajpiano> but also being serious
[13:49:13] <ajpiano> :)
[13:49:21] <salientKnight> added the quotes...
[13:49:23] <supsup> i could just not tell if u were joking
[13:49:31] <supsup> it appeared almost as if u were
[13:49:34] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: Let's see
[13:49:41] <Eviltwin> View the source of the page
[13:49:44] <supsup> i used to watch football but then i stopped when the Oilers left Houston then iw as like F THAT
[13:49:56] <ajpiano> aw bummer
[13:50:05] <Eviltwin> If you don't see the quotes in the loaded page source, it's still cached
[13:50:19] <salientKnight> http://pastebin.com/4iditKu1
[13:50:51] <salientKnight> this is from the loaded page 	$("#shipto").html(shipto);//this does not work
[13:51:00] <ajpiano> salientKnight: making a live demo helps
[13:51:14] <ajpiano> salientKnight: we have no way of seeing how it fails from a static paste
[13:51:26] <ajpiano> also the 7th line of that paste looks woefully invalid
[13:51:34] <salientKnight> yeah I cannot to that because the data is coming from php
[13:51:45] <salientKnight> it's a json encoded array
[13:52:02] <ajpiano> do what eviltwin said, create a paste using the generated source
[13:52:28] <salientKnight> but that should not matter because my string has a value and can be output to the alert box with no problems
[13:52:38] <salientKnight> the problem is only coming when I try to push it into a div
[13:52:54] <salientKnight> ok I can try that
[13:52:58] <ajpiano> salientKnight: you can either help yourself be helped or you probably won't get any - posting a static paste and insisting repeatedly that "it doesn't work" tends not to solve javascript problems with methods that are proven to work
[13:52:59] <ajpiano> ok
[13:53:10] <salientKnight> ajpiano, working on helping :)
[13:53:16] <ajpiano> ok good :)
[13:58:28] <OliverTynes> trying to figure out where i should start looking if an $.ajax (very simple, its a retrieve that updates a div with $(selector).append() in the success) works in all browsers, including ie6 and ie8
[13:58:32] <OliverTynes> but not ie7
[13:59:41] <moo-> is there any way to figure out why when i try add a class to a selector, it does not seem to work?
[14:00:29] <minna1> Hm, i just updated a div using .on('change' and it got replaced, but now the change event on the updated select element doesn't work. I thought the point of using .on('change' was to replace .live('change' ?
[14:00:36] <JKarsrud> moo-: you can console.log the length of the selector to see if it actually returns any elements;console.log($(selector).length)
[14:01:39] <moo-> JKarsrud, thanks
[14:01:59] <moo-> it returned 0
[14:02:10] <JKarsrud> right, so it doesn't hit any elements then
[14:02:17] <jklmnop> has anyone successfully been able to set a file input value based on second file input value via js?
[14:02:54] <m1chael> anyone have any experience in doing a multi file (photo+video) upload form? id like to utilize html5/state of the art technologies for this.. is there a jquery/mootools thing for this? any suggestions?
[14:03:39] <minna1> Hm, anyone?
[14:04:10] <JKarsrud> minna1: do you have an example? Maybe you could make a jsfiddle?
[14:04:20] <minna1> JKarsrud: will do :)
[14:06:27] <minna1> JKarsrud: Just noticed it's kind of hard to make a .load sample in jsfiddle, it uses iframes ;-)
[14:06:34] <j0llyr0tten> oi, how to convert jQuery node to a DOM node? please, pretty please....
[14:06:38] <ajpiano> jklmnop: you can't manipulate the value of an input type='file' in js
[14:06:39] <Tyler> is anyone using the .on() function?  I keep getting $(document).on is not a function
[14:06:52] <ajpiano> j0llyr0tten: $("foo")[0] or $("#foo").get(0)
[14:06:52] <jklmnop> i'm not trying to manipulate… just clone
[14:06:56] <ajpiano> Tyler: it's new in 1.7
[14:06:59] <Tyler> I know
[14:07:08] <Tyler> I'm using 1.7
[14:07:09] <minna1> Tyler: Make sure you don't load jquery from google, it's not there yet ;)
[14:07:10] <ajpiano> jklmnop: i think it loses the value when you clone, and it can't be set programatically, so again, same problem
[14:07:21] <jklmnop> ajpiano: yeah i feared that
[14:07:22] <JKarsrud> minna1: well, make a smaller testcase where you add the markup dynamically with jQuery instead of using .load then?
[14:07:24] <ajpiano> Tyler: i'm skeptical of that claim :p
[14:07:27] <jklmnop> ajpiano: just gotta do it a different way :)
[14:07:41] <Tyler> is there a console command I can enter to verify what version of jquery is being used?
[14:07:59] <minna1> Tyler: Use firebug and check scripts?
[14:08:04] <j0llyr0tten> ajpiano: really? that's all it is? that gives the DOM object, not just a html string or something?
[14:08:06] <ajpiano> Tyler: console.log( jQuery.fn.jquery );
[14:08:15] <ajpiano> j0llyr0tten: yes it gives you the underlying dom element
[14:08:32] <Tyler> ajpiano, thanks a bunch
[14:08:49] <j0llyr0tten> ajpiano: oh my god, i've been operating under a huge delusion as to how jQ operates :) groooooan
[14:08:57] <ajpiano> lol
[14:08:59] <minna1> JKarsrud: .load is part of jquery and it is loading dynamically. I'll try with .live and see if that works.
[14:09:59] <minna1> JKarsrud: Yes, using .live instead of .on works!
[14:10:09] <minna1> JKarsrud: And i am still on 1.7
[14:10:13] <j0llyr0tten> ajpiano: thanks man
[14:14:02] <JKarsrud> minna1: I know, I was thinking more on jsfiddle
[14:14:11] <JKarsrud> like.. dynamically add the markup :)
[14:14:21] <JKarsrud> but if live works, then great :)=
[14:14:48] <minna1> JKarsrud: Not that great, .live is deprecated.
[14:14:56] <JKarsrud> I know it is
[14:15:13] <j0llyr0tten> ajpiano: so i should think of jQ functions as working on arrays of regular dom elements then?
[14:15:22] <ajpiano> j0llyr0tten: pretty much
[14:15:42] <ajpiano> j0llyr0tten: you can even get the simple array of dom elements only by doing $(".selector").get() //no args
[14:15:44] <JKarsrud> minna1: and I don't know why .on() doesn't work like expected there...
[14:15:44] <j0llyr0tten> ajpiano: and the magical $ function just constructs those arrays in a cinch for me
[14:15:55] <minna1> JKarsrud: I'll setup a sample package.
[14:16:15] <minna1> JKarsrud: I tried looking for issues on github but that section is not available.
[14:16:19] <ajpiano> yes, it queries the dom and returns you the elements that match the selector, in DOM order, and provides conveniences for doing things to everything that set and manipulating the set itself
[14:16:54] <JKarsrud> minna1: no, it's on bugs.jquery.com :)
[14:17:11] <minna1> JKarsrud: Thanks :-)
[14:17:22] <minna1> JKarsrud: I see .on is a bit different, i'll try and read up.
[14:17:52] <minna1> JKarsrud: i think the selector need to earlier.
[14:18:09] <moo-> i wrote an app with jquery and my browser gets unresponsive often, how can i fix this?
[14:18:25] <Bankzilla> find the loop thats repeating
[14:18:43] <JKarsrud> moo-: that depends on what you've done wrong, but you're probably looping endlessly somewhere
[14:18:49] <Eviltwin> moo-: Maybe share some of the code so we can help you check it?
[14:19:13] <Primer> http://jsfiddle.net/wwr6e/10/ <-- $.ajax({ url: google maps API, dataType: 'jsonp', jsonp: 'callback' } check the error. Bug?
[14:19:42] <Primer> the jQuery123123123123() is being called from the google maps code, yet, it doesn't exist?
[14:20:12] <ajpiano> Primer: using document.write is a terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible way to debug code
[14:20:16] <ajpiano> it DOMinates the DOM
[14:20:30] <moo-> JKarsrud, i have no for() or while() but i have some .each()
[14:20:32] <Primer> the jsfiddle attempts to explain everything
[14:20:41] <Primer> ajpiano: that's just for the jsfiddle
[14:20:49] <Eviltwin> Primer: Learn how to console
[14:20:50] <ajpiano> Primer: also JSONP can be weird in situations where you're not operating in the same window object where it cereates the function
[14:20:50] <Primer> what would you have me use instead?
[14:20:52] <moo-> Eviltwin, its 18+ kb
[14:21:04] <ajpiano> for example, a chrome extension
[14:21:06] <Primer> Eviltwin: meh, my code uses console.log()
[14:21:14] <Eviltwin> moo-: Then best of luck
[14:21:17] <Eviltwin> Check loops and recursion
[14:21:31] <Primer> I just wanted the output to be in the fiddle
[14:21:37] <Primer> seemed logical to have it there
[14:21:42] <ajpiano> wtf
[14:21:55] <ajpiano> that wasn't at that
[14:22:08] <danzik17> Primer: http://jsfiddle.net/wwr6e/11/ - wonder if ajpiano is right about the window since the callback certainly exists.
[14:22:21] <Primer> ajpiano: anyhow, it's calling window.jQuery123123123(), but I guess somehow that code's in another window
[14:23:38] <Primer> danzik17: indeed
[14:24:07] <Primer> Can anyone think of a way around this then?
[14:24:27] <supsup> you can never escape this it is all present
[14:24:50] <supsup> jk random~
[14:24:59] <danzik17> Primer: look at the returned contents anyway - it's not a json object.  try using dataType: 'script'
[14:25:01] <danzik17> http://jsfiddle.net/wwr6e/13/
[14:25:42] * Primer tries
[14:26:18] <moo-> is there any good way to find stuff that make the browser freeze?
[14:27:04] <Eviltwin> Not particularly
[14:27:25] <minna1> JKarsrud: Yeah, i had to use .on the right way and it worked.
[14:27:30] <Primer> danzik17: except it's not sending the callback to the request
[14:27:38] <JKarsrud> minna1: awesome!
[14:27:46] <minna1> JKarsrud: Thanks for listening :-)
[14:28:04] <JKarsrud> no problems, not like I have anything else to do on a monday evening
[14:28:13] <Primer> but it doesn't matter since my callback is being called anyhow
[14:28:16] <danzik17> Primer: the returned data is a script, so it's being evaluated.  is that not what you want?
[14:28:24] <Primer> indeed
[14:28:27] <minna1> JKarsrud: I'd like to sleep, but having too fun with 1.7 ;-)
[14:28:56] <minna1> Do anyone have a benchmark of 1.7 speed compared to 1.6.4?
[14:29:00] <JKarsrud> hah, I've been having issues with node0.6.0 all night, so my plans kinda sunk, but I figured I'd fix it later
[14:29:05] <minna1> Would be exciting to know :)
[14:29:17] <opie_> minna1: check the site there are performances graphs under the release notes
[14:29:21] <minna1> JKarsrud: node.js?
[14:29:28] <JKarsrud> minna1: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[14:29:31] <minna1> opie_: Thanks :-)
[14:29:32] <JKarsrud> minna1: yeah
[14:29:57] <minna1> JKarsrud: Nice, i've gotten node.js on my list, just have to learn proper javascript first ;)
[14:30:11] <Primer> heh, now jquery is issuing an OPTIONS request against the google maps API url...and google hates that
[14:30:39] <SynJu> Anyone have a nice tutorial on constant updating of a div? using jquery
[14:30:55] <Primer> well, in my code, not in the fiddle
[14:30:59] <ajpiano> Primer: this service isn't really sending back JSONP
[14:31:13] <JKarsrud> SynJu what do you mean?
[14:31:23] <Primer> ajpiano: right, seems we've solved it. Thanks
[14:31:31] <ajpiano> ok
[14:31:34] <minna1> Oh my god, 1.7 is VERY fast on event's now
[14:31:48] <opie_> tons faster
[14:31:48] <SynJu> I wana use setinterval to constantly update an area using jquery
[14:31:59] <SynJu> no idea how tho.
[14:32:04] <minna1> Super stuff!
[14:32:08] <moo-> what is difference between event.keyCode and event.which?
[14:32:16] <minna1> This is exciting!
[14:32:36] <JKarsrud> SynJu: use setInterval then? :)
[14:32:55] <SynJu> lol..
[14:33:03] <SynJu> pm
[14:33:04] <Eviltwin> minna1: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[14:33:06] <Eviltwin> moo-: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[14:33:10] <minna1> still required modernizr for html5 tags though
[14:33:54] <Primer> sigh, code is the same as the fiddle, but now I'm seeing this: OPTIONS http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false 405 (Method Not Allowed)
[14:34:05] <Primer> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false. Origin http://daniel-home-dev.www.policymap.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[14:34:22] <Primer> 1.6.<4 vs. 1.6.4+?
[14:34:35] <Primer> no idea what to make of this. The code is identical
[14:34:50] <Ebonwumon> Is it possible to use ajax to get all the HTML on a page? basically just call a URL and then the onsuccess would just return the Document as data?
[14:35:11] <Eviltwin> Ebonwumon: That's kind of what AJAX does
[14:35:14] <JKarsrud> SynJu: what is your problem? jQuery is JS, so if you know how to use setInterval, you should be good, right? What is it that you want to update with? :)
[14:35:18] <Eviltwin> But it has to be on the same protocol/domain/port
[14:35:49] <minna1> Hm, is jquery cached on mobiles?
[14:36:01] <Eviltwin> minna1: Depends on the mobile
[14:36:03] <ajpiano> Primer: do you actually need to *handle* the data
[14:36:08] <SynJu> JKarsrud, I'm simply trying to update text in a <div> but constantly.. preparing a pastebin
[14:36:11] <SynJu> brb
[14:36:11] <ajpiano> that is returned by this script thing?
[14:36:15] <ajpiano> or just get a callback to fire??
[14:36:16] <minna1> Eviltwin: android, ios.
[14:36:46] <Primer> ajpiano: no, I just need to run the callback
[14:36:49] <ajpiano> Primer: cause you can try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/wwr6e/15/
[14:36:54] <ajpiano> Primer: ^^ that seems to do the trick
[14:37:09] <ajpiano> tell it to use a specific function instead of the generated one
[14:37:12] <Eviltwin> minna1: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[14:37:18] <SynJu> it hasnt got jquery in it yet. im new to jquery and i havent found a tutorial for it that shows how to constantly update any particular <div>
[14:37:31] <Eviltwin> minna1: http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/02/06/iphone-cacheability/
[14:37:36] <Primer> ajpiano: well, http://jsfiddle.net/wwr6e/13/ works too
[14:37:51] <ajpiano> SynJu: if you keep looking for perfect tutorials that teach you the entire problem, you aren't going to get very far
[14:37:57] <ajpiano> first learn how to update any div
[14:38:04] <ajpiano> then learn how to use setInterval to do anything repeatedly
[14:38:06] <minna1> Eviltwin: Yeah, ivé heard about the 25k limit... jquery is 93k
[14:38:07] <ajpiano> then combine the two things you learn
[14:38:15] <Primer> the callback is called, and presumably, the code is run too
[14:38:27] <SynJu> not a perfect tutorial. lol.. just something for the kind of thing im trying to achieve.. i know theres no such thing as a perfect tutorial lol
[14:38:50] <ajpiano> SynJu: $("#foo").html("<div>hi</div>") is how you update the html of the div with ID food
[14:38:58] <ajpiano> SynJu: you might want to take a look at see ?jqf
[14:38:58] <bot-t> SynJu, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:40:29] <SynJu> let me just show my paste lol..
[14:42:21] <salientKnight> Eviltwin, hey here is what I have going on that jsfiddle site
[14:42:26] <salientKnight> http://jsfiddle.net/amJtZ/
[14:42:30] <SynJu> here it is: ---> http://pastebin.com/4T7k7fRd <--- you will see theres no jquery in it.. i wish to replicate the idea behind it using jquery.
[14:42:58] <SynJu> update.php is simply <?php echo date("h:i:s" ,time()); ?>
[14:43:50] <Eviltwin> salientKnight: http://jsfiddle.net/amJtZ/2/
[14:43:58] <Eviltwin> All you were adding were hidden fields....
[14:44:11] <Eviltwin> So...not visible...
[14:44:20] <SynJu> ajpiano, mind taking a look?
[14:44:43] <salientKnight> Eviltwin,  right but I should be able to see them in the div when I view page source no?
[14:44:52] <Eviltwin> Nope
[14:44:58] <Eviltwin> Page source will never, ever change after it lodas
[14:45:00] <Eviltwin> loads*
[14:45:19] <salientKnight> so basically, its probably been working the whole time LOL
[14:45:24] <salientKnight> thank you :)
[14:45:32] <salientKnight> Eviltwin++
[14:45:35] <Eviltwin> .innerHTML doesn't change the source either
[14:45:47] <Eviltwin> JavaScript manipulates the DOM
[14:45:53] <ajpiano> SynJu: this is your one freebie: http://jsfiddle.net/mp95b/
[14:45:54] <Eviltwin> The parsed and tree'd version of the source
[14:46:06] <SynJu> looking
[14:46:16] <salientKnight> makes sense... just a tired brain at the end of crazy day :) thank you very much
[14:46:18] <ajpiano> SynJu: that shows using jQuery's .load() method inside of a setInterval call to update the content of a div
[14:46:26] <ajpiano> using jsfiddle's simulated ajax requests interface
[14:46:36] <SynJu> okay looking
[14:52:26] <salientKnight> Eviltwin, can I ask you another question? I'm assuming that .html() overwrites content, what's the command to insert content?
[14:52:57] <Eviltwin> Insert where?
[14:53:05] <Eviltwin> Before or after the existing content?
[14:53:14] <salientKnight> either or
[14:53:25] <Eviltwin> .after() and .before()
[14:53:25] <salientKnight> I'm trying to add those fields into a form
[14:53:38] <salientKnight> ah perfect thank you
[14:57:59] <xckpd7> hey I have a question: for compatibility reasons I need to change a tag (from <div> to <td>) only in IE7 (trust me the only way this will work the way I want). What's the best way to do it?
[14:58:21] <minna1> Hm, what do you jquery folks think about "responsive webdesign" is it a waste of time?
[14:58:37] <xckpd7> I initially am trying to do a wrap, grab the classes on the current element, place them on the td, and then I'm trying to unwrap one level lower...
[14:58:57] <ajpiano> minna1: um, no
[14:59:49] <minna1> ajpiano: I've found many of the "responsive" sites quite laggy on a common smartphone. But still worth it?
[14:59:54] <pindropper> i am moving a div across my page by animating the 'left' css property. But I am seeing some major flicker in the animation. i tried doing it differently, by increasing padding. I still see a massive flickering. I tried it in safari, chrome, opera and firefox. the behaviour is the same. What am I missing?
[15:00:45] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Can you in a pastebin or something show the before and after?
[15:00:46] <ajpiano> minna1: that's such anecdotal evidence compared to what it potentially offers
[15:01:32] <Eviltwin> Has anyone here used piazza.com?
[15:03:03] <minna1> ajpiano: what do you mean?
[15:03:21] <labratt> looking at it now… looks cool
[15:03:33] <Eviltwin> minna1: It means that *you* have had a poor experience with *some* sites
[15:03:43] <ajpiano> i mean that rwd is like an up and coming technique that can really help simplify doing websites that look nice across devices,
[15:04:01] <ajpiano> to dismiss it as "a wwaste of time" because it was "kind of laggy"
[15:04:14] <ajpiano> seems unwise
[15:04:31] <minna1> I didn't dismiss it, i was looking for opinions, and here they are.
[15:04:42] <ajpiano> good :)
[15:04:50] <Gorkyman> is anyone using jQuery Datepicker (keith-wood.name) ?
[15:04:53] <minna1> So i guess speed is not an issue, technology will get faster and the code slimmer?
[15:05:25] <ajpiano> ostensibly
[15:05:32] <labratt> i use date picker whats up
[15:05:40] <ajpiano> if you look at the history of computing it shows that if speed is the issue now, it won't be pretty soon
[15:06:24] <minna1> Very true.
[15:06:30] <Gorkyman> labratt: I want to predefine selected date... I'm using 'defaultDate' and 'selectDefaultDate : true' ... but it doesnt get selected only hover is set..
[15:07:33] <labratt> instead just set a default value for the field
[15:08:14] <labratt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/233553/how-do-i-pre-populate-a-jquery-datepicker-textbox-with-todays-date
[15:08:19] <labratt> that should help
[15:08:20] <minna1> ajpiano: i guess devices will stop working eventually, and people buy new ones, so as you say, great benefits, no real issues.
[15:08:31] <labratt> $(".date-pick").datepicker('setDate', new Date());
[15:08:49] <labratt> is that what you are looking for
[15:08:55] <Gorkyman> hm lets try
[15:09:30] <labratt> if not setup a http://jsfiddle.net and i can mess with it
[15:10:24] <coldhead> bloody sharks
[15:14:56] <dogan> hello i use cookie plugin and can't make it to save an array to cookie. is it possible to save array to cookie?
[15:15:52] <Eviltwin> dogan: Look at JSON
[15:16:04] <PPaul> can my DOM ids have periods and spaces in them?
[15:16:38] <rafabenitez> anyone familiar with using jquery for ajax?
[15:16:40] <Eviltwin> "ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[15:16:47] <Eviltwin> No spaces
[15:16:58] <dogan> ok so directly is impossible, i will do it with json, thanks
[15:17:13] <PPaul> thanks
[15:17:26] <Eviltwin> dogan: Cookies store strings
[15:17:28] <Eviltwin> Arrays aren't strings
[15:18:00] <dogan> ok thanks a lot
[15:18:14] <Eviltwin> rafabenitez: Yes, some of us have used it before once or twice
[15:19:06] <pindropper> anyone has had any experience with flickering that occurs while animating divs?
[15:19:24] <rafabenitez> my question may be more ajax specific, but I was wondering if there are any solutions inherent to jquery: if I am making request through jquery to a php file which will return data, people will be able to see the php address I am requesting, and will be able to potentially access this php file directly. Are there any good solutions to make sure that users can not access the page directly, but only through the pages I choose?
[15:19:28] <Eviltwin> pindropper: Most "flickering" is because you're running more than one animation at once
[15:20:15] <Eviltwin> rafabenitez: It is literally impossible to have the browser or JavaScript or AJAX make a request that the user could not make directly
[15:20:21] <PPaul> i'm doing     city = $("#address.city"), but it's giving me undefined
[15:20:21] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do?
[15:20:29] <PPaul> well, it's giving me a empty array
[15:20:42] <pindropper> Eviltwin: I am sure I am not. I am simply moving a div horizontally across the screen. I am also animating only one property . i,e, that left property. The behaviour is the same across webkit, gecko
[15:20:42] <Eviltwin> PPaul: Oh, that's another issue
[15:20:50] <pifantastic> PPaul: escape the period
[15:20:51] <Eviltwin> PPaul: That's because selectors don't accept periods in them
[15:20:54] <Eviltwin> So escape it
[15:20:55] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[15:20:57] <PPaul> ok
[15:20:58] <pifantastic> $("#address\.city")
[15:21:11] <dogan> is there something ready in jquery to convert an array to json?
[15:21:24] <Eviltwin> #("#address\\.city") actually
[15:21:25] <pifantastic> Otherwise it thinks it is <div id="address" class="city" />
[15:21:38] <Techdeck> hey guys, how can I detect if my browser supports flash or not from JS?
[15:21:45] <Techdeck> if SWFObject... how?
[15:22:10] <rafabenitez> Eviltwin: Yes, this is what I figured, though I was hoping there would be some tricks based on tokens or sessions or something like that. while they aren't foolproof, it might make it a little more difficult for users to figure out
[15:22:22] <Eviltwin> pindropper: How are you animating it?
[15:22:48] <Techdeck> nvm, got it, thank you
[15:23:02] <pindropper> Eviltwin: by changing the left css property. have a look: http://pastebin.com/jx3yztHA
[15:23:20] <PPaul> street = $("#address/.street"),
[15:23:29] <PPaul> and street = $("#address\.street"),
[15:23:30] <PPaul> no good
[15:24:14] <Eviltwin> PPaul: $("#address\\.street"),
[15:24:16] <Eviltwin> Two \'s
[15:24:26] <Eviltwin> pindropper: Can you make this in a jsFiddle?
[15:24:28] <Eviltwin> So we can actually see?
[15:24:53] <pindropper> Eviltwin: ok. let me have a go. never done it before
[15:27:26] <Eviltwin> pindropper: Well it's a good thing to learn
[15:27:34] <Eviltwin> It's the preferred way of getting help for problems in here
[15:27:42] <Eviltwin> Since it means we don't have to do any more work to play wiht it
[15:27:54] <pindropper> Eviltwin: yeah. i am seeing the power of it.
[15:28:09] <Eviltwin> Since none of us are obligated to help with anything, it's a good idea to make it as convenient as possible for us to help you
[15:29:19] <pindropper> Eviltwin: ok here: http://jsfiddle.net/2wtkF/ but the script doesn't seem to be running. must be the way in which i need to put in things into jsfiddle.
[15:29:57] <Eviltwin> Well you got half the idea
[15:30:04] <Eviltwin> The goal isn't to copy your entire page into it
[15:30:14] <Eviltwin> It's to make a small, working example of your issue
[15:30:32] <Eviltwin> So maybe have one div
[15:30:34] <Eviltwin> And animate it
[15:31:33] <pindropper> Eviltwin: oh. i thought maybe if i put up the whole page, it would be clearer, because maybe the issue turns up from me trying to overlay a div on top of an existing div and then trying to animate things on top of it. anyway... what should i do here?
[15:31:45] <Eviltwin> Right now
[15:31:58] <Eviltwin> There's a hell of a lot to dig through to find the problem
[15:32:05] <Eviltwin> That's not what we're here for
[15:32:14] <Eviltwin> Your job is to boil the problem down as much as you can
[15:32:22] <Eviltwin> Then if you still can't figure it out, ask us
[15:32:27] <pindropper> ok... im gonna try.
[15:32:39] <Eviltwin> So try taking parts away until your problem isn't there any more
[15:32:44] <Eviltwin> Then you'll know what the problem areas are
[15:32:56] <PPaul> thanks EvilTwin
[15:33:11] <Eviltwin> PPaul: No problem
[15:35:00] <ryanneufeld> what's the proper way to animate scrollTop?
[15:36:29] <PPaul> i have a checkbox $node... i want to know if it's checked or not. i see the HTML.checked = true, how do i access this with jQuery?
[15:36:49] <Eviltwin> I believe you want to look at .val()
[15:37:35] <PPaul> nope
[15:37:35] <ajpiano> PPaul: $("foo").is(":checked")
[15:37:37] <PPaul> i thnk attr
[15:37:42] <PPaul> i'll try is
[15:38:04] <PPaul> is worked, thank you
[15:38:47] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to figure out what's the proper way to animate scrollTop?
[15:40:21] <Eviltwin> Are you?
[15:40:41] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yes, I am
[15:40:42] <terrysutton> Can anyone help me figure out how to print "Site Title" just once when you start scrolling here:   http://jsfiddle.net/saltcod/NwFc9/
[15:40:54] <ryanneufeld> seems $(
[15:41:13] <ryanneufeld> $('body').animate({scrollTop:200}); works
[15:41:24] <ryanneufeld> my troubles are elsewhere
[15:42:08] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: seems to work fine here http://jsfiddle.net/zfK8Z/
[15:42:11] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:42:12] <ryanneufeld> it does
[15:42:23] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to make it happen on the parent from an iframe
[15:43:44] <supsup> what if he hates boiled code tho I perfer to saute my code
[15:44:38] <Eviltwin> terrysutton: Is this kind of what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/NwFc9/2/
[15:46:29] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: the problem I'm having is I have an iframe open in a light box, when that box loads i need to trigger the parent window to scroll
[15:46:42] <terrysutton> Eviltwin: hummm!  one sec.  I think its really close
[15:46:52] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I've tried $('body',window.top).animate({scrollTop:totalOffset-150});   but that doesn't seem to be it
[15:47:36] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: what about just $(top.document.body)
[15:48:10] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano+++
[15:48:23] <ryanneufeld> such a pain working between frames
[15:48:35] <ajpiano> now you know how museum security guards feel
[15:48:51] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: confused?
[15:48:58] <ajpiano> they have to work in between frames
[15:49:12] <ryanneufeld> ./rimshot ajpiano
[15:49:23] <ryanneufeld> lol
[15:49:35] <ryanneufeld> that was honestly really terrible dude hahah
[15:49:36] <Ebonwumon> Save it for #cybersex guys.
[15:49:37] <terrysutton> Eviltwin: I'd actually like to keep the two together—just  put the site title .before() so that they both scroll down the page—like this; http://cl.ly/1u171c3V3v083J3h3H09
[15:50:08] <synju2> ajpiano, you still here?
[15:50:12] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: :D
[15:50:15] <ajpiano> synju2: nope
[15:50:18] <synju2> haha
[15:50:21] <ajpiano> as you can tell i'm distinctly not here
[15:50:27] <pindropper> Eviltwin: ok. i tried your suggestion. i boiled it down to the bare minimum, and yet the flicker persists. you can see it here: http://jsfiddle.net/2wtkF/3/ . please have a look.
[15:50:40] <synju2> could you look at http://jsfiddle.net/mp95b/1/ ? please?
[15:51:02] <ajpiano> done
[15:51:04] <ajpiano> i looked right at it
[15:51:18] <synju2> lol.. please tell me where im going wrong..
[15:51:39] <ajpiano> synju2 http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[15:51:55] <ajpiano> and you have to get $("#foo") *inside* of the document ready function
[15:52:00] <pindropper> Eviltwin: sorry. look at http://jsfiddle.net/2wtkF/4/ . i removed some more irrelevant stuff.
[15:52:26] <Eviltwin> terrysutton: You can probably work from: http://jsfiddle.net/NwFc9/3/
[15:52:52] <terrysutton> Looks quite close Eviltwin: thanks a lot
[15:52:52] <SynJu> ok.. lol..
[15:52:54] <ajpiano> SynJu: it is better to use setInterval with a function reference as well, instead of a string
[15:53:28] <SynJu> why?
[15:53:46] <ajpiano> because using strings that end up getting evaled is gross
[15:54:19] <ajpiano> the only reason you see it in so many examples is because so many people have been propagating the same crap in a vicous repeating cycle
[15:54:28] <SynJu> heh okay
[15:54:35] <SynJu> mental note made
[15:55:21] <Eviltwin> terrysutton: http://jsfiddle.net/2wtkF/5/show/
[15:55:28] <Eviltwin> You mean how it's not perfectly smooth?
[15:55:54] <terrysutton> wrong guy Eviltwin =)
[15:55:59] <Eviltwin> SOrry
[15:56:07] <Eviltwin> pindropper: You mean how it's not perfectly smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/2wtkF/5/show/
[15:57:22] <pindropper> Eviltwin: yeah. and sometimes its almost as if it disappears for a fraction of a second.
[15:57:46] <Eviltwin> pindropper: This is an unfortunate limitation of JavaScript-based animations
[15:57:55] <Eviltwin> You can look at CSS3 animations if the browsers will support it
[15:58:05] <Eviltwin> But unfortunately you might not be able to do much better
[15:58:19] <_chun> Hi; how do I catch the "onplay" event of <audio> with jquery?
[15:58:50] <pindropper> Eviltwin: really? aww. thats very disappointing. but i see that the jquery toggleup down etc animations look so smooth. how come this isnt? is it to do with speed and distance
[15:58:52] <pindropper> ?
[15:59:13] <coldhead> the jquery animations use flash
[16:00:38] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: ignore coldhead, he's lying
[16:00:51] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: most likely your CPU Needs replacing
[16:01:34] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: lol. of course he lying. also my cpu is i7 with 8 gb ram and 1.5g nvidia gtx. i dont think that is the problem
[16:01:49] <ryanneufeld> clearly you need more ramz
[16:01:59] <ryanneufeld> and 1.5g doesn't sound very big
[16:02:08] <bot-t> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facetious
[16:02:38] <ryanneufeld> haha
[16:02:42] <ryanneufeld> so true
[16:02:46] <pindropper> Eviltwin, ryanneufeld: i thought this must be a problem with jquery, because i wrote the animation at formness.com homepage without any jquery. totally custom and that runs smooth.
[16:02:49] <terrysutton> Works like a charm—just a bit of extra CSS sealed the deal, Eviltwin: Thanks x 10.
[16:04:24] <SynJu> ajpiano, is this better? - still wrong i know, its not working, but is it better? http://jsfiddle.net/mp95b/2/
[16:04:55] <ajpiano> good lord
[16:04:58] <SynJu> lol
[16:05:01] <SynJu> k shoot me now
[16:05:20] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: I looked at your example, and what's wrong with it?
[16:05:40] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: the moving div isnt animating smoothly. thats what
[16:05:45] <ryanneufeld> it is

[16:06:14] <PhonicUK> hey all - what'd be the best way to do a 'starfield' effect, but with text elements?
[16:06:20] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: what do you mean?
[16:06:22] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: chrome, on a MacPro 8core zeon
[16:06:24] <SynJu> :]
[16:06:55] <coldhead> ?animate @ PhonicUK
[16:06:55] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: well, I think because of how small the div is, it seeems jittery cause the render engine has to repaint a lot
[16:06:55] <bot-t> PhonicUK, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:07:07] <SynJu> everyone take note! ajpiano is a god.
[16:07:17] <SynJu> bow down
[16:07:22] * SynJu bows down
[16:07:24] <ryanneufeld> SynJu: we all know that
[16:07:31] <SynJu> haha
[16:07:36] <PhonicUK> how precisely can it animate?
[16:07:38] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: it's doing the same thing in firefox too
[16:07:40] <PhonicUK> text is a bit tricky
[16:07:52] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: well.... is there any solution to this?
[16:08:02] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: css transitions
[16:08:32] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: hmm. i guess its worth a shot.

[16:12:14] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: taken from the css here: http://css-tricks.com/
[16:15:29] <cpierce> is there a way to animate 	$('body').css('backgroundImage', 'url("'+image+'")'); to ease the image in … i tried fading but it fades the entire page since its the body i'm working with
[16:19:31] <raar> Can anyone recommend me a plugin/functionality that can darken a div (so like the inverted of lightbox) and reset it back to normal? I have an ajax paginator for a small part of the website, and would like that part to darken while loading new content, leaving the rest of the site normal
[16:25:20] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: wow
[16:25:27] <pindropper> thanks man. i dont know why it works.
[16:25:30] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: ?
[16:25:32] <ryanneufeld> lol
[16:25:43] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: that makes no logical sense.
[16:26:01] <ryanneufeld> basically you set a transition on the css of the element, so when you change any of it's css properties, it gets that transition animation
[16:26:51] <BG_> using jquery.bubblepopup, any idea why the white stripe? http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/3893/bubblepopup.png
[16:27:02] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: but dint you just add a settimeout to the function? theres no other change. or did you by mistake give me a wrong link.
[16:27:32] <ryanneufeld> BG_: probably some css conflict
[16:28:00] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: the settimeout was there, and all it does is delay the action enough that you can scroll the window to watch it :p
[16:28:12] <ryanneufeld> BG_: try #css
[16:28:23] <BG_> what's #css?
[16:28:36] <ryanneufeld> BG_: /join #css
[16:28:42] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: even that makes the animation better. so strange. but what trick from css-tricks? i dont see any change anywhere.
[16:28:55] <ryanneufeld> BG_: it's like #jquery  but a channel for css
[16:29:01] <BG_> yeah, I get it
[16:29:04] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: sorry. just saw it.
[16:29:09] <BG_> thanks
[16:29:15] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: the #linediv css right?
[16:29:22] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: yeah. what does that do?
[16:29:40] <ryanneufeld> basically you set a transition on the css of the element, so when you change any of it's css properties, it gets that transition animation
[16:29:53] <ryanneufeld> pindropper: I'm not explaining it well
[16:29:58] <pindropper> ryanneufeld: aaah! no i got it
[16:30:00] <ryanneufeld> so I'll call it sorcery
[16:30:04] <pindropper> lol
[16:30:10] <pindropper> it sure did look like that for a while

[16:58:30] <jgspratt> on http://dordt.edu/tintle/#home I am trying to use https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js , but I have to resize the window to get it to trigger; otherwise the .main_title is really small.  how can I fix th is?
[16:59:45] <Tatsh> jgspratt, looks fine to me
[17:00:03] <Tatsh> i do question your use of a picture for that 'Dig Deeper' header
[17:00:38] <jgspratt> when I first load that in FF, the "Undergraduate Research" is tiny
[17:01:25] <jgspratt> and in Chrome
[17:02:43] <zkirill> Would it be sensical to capture .scroll() and make your own scrolling implementation if I don't want to see the native scrollbar
[17:03:53] <Tatsh> in chrome it looks fine jgspratt
[17:04:13] <Tatsh> you'd have to give a screenshot to really show the issue
[17:04:21] <Tatsh> even in Firefox it looks fine
[17:04:37] <m_tadeu> hi...I'm trying to use the validator, but minlength and maxlength are not working
[17:04:58] <Tatsh> actually jgspratt it doesn't work in Firefox properly
[17:05:16] <Tatsh> if i resize width too small the header goes underneath the 'Dig Deeper' box
[17:05:20] <jgspratt> yeah, I took it all out
[17:05:39] <Tatsh> why worry? why not use media queries to do this task anyway?
[17:06:29] <jgspratt> Tatsh: tomorrow.  thanks!

[17:08:31] <patrick99e99> Hi everyone.. Is there a simple way to find all selects on a page that have the value of "" ?
[17:26:37] <Jon47> patrick99e99.. you could try $('select[value=""]')
[17:29:36] <patrick99e99> Jon47: yeah I tried that.. it doesn't seem to work, my guess is because <option selected=...> is the way it works
[17:31:33] <Jon47> how about..  $('option[selected][value=""]').parent('select')
[17:39:37] <sorahn> hey guys, is there a way to open a select menu from anything that isn't a select?
[17:40:36] <jedimind_> eh?
[17:40:57] <sorahn> lets say i just had a text link, and i wanted it to bring up a select menu when clicked.
[17:43:42] <jedimind_> no you cant
[17:43:47] <jedimind_> the only thing you can do is focus the select
[17:43:54] <jedimind_> or perhaps change its size if you want onclick but that's just cumbersome
[17:44:06] <sorahn> ok.

[17:44:47] <amh345> is it possible to delete a cookie if the browser is refreshed?
[17:44:49] <jedimind_> basic proof of concept
[17:45:24] <amh345> is it $(window).unload(function() { //delete cookie }?
[17:45:59] <sorahn> jedimind_: why does it change to a multiselect?
[17:46:27] <sorahn> oh nvm
[17:46:28] <sorahn> size=6
[17:46:30] <sorahn> got it
[17:47:33] <SynJu> how can I read the text already inside a <div> and then use it? eg data: <div> --this text-- </div>
[17:47:35] <sorahn> hey, that actually works in iOS
[17:47:42] <sorahn> if you focus the select, it opens the iphone select dialog
[17:48:36] <jedimind_> yeah, i imagine the focus would on a mobile device
[17:48:38] <jedimind_> but not on a pc
[17:49:04] <sorahn> right.  This is for mobile, so that might work.  now to just hide the select box, and off we go!
[17:49:32] <sorahn> thanks!
[17:49:59] <SynJu> anyone? ajpiano ? how can i read the data already inside a div.. eg data: <div> --this text-- </div>

[18:41:21] <Primer> So I'm at a bit of a loss here. How does $.ajax({ dataType: 'script' ...}) know when the code is loaded before it runs the success callback?
[18:41:55] <Primer> It seems that it doesn't...that it's just running it as soon as it's issued
[18:45:36] <Primer> or not

[19:21:07] <scar2> Is there a way to have the Accordion and/or the Tab plugins to "auto-change" tabs/accordion slots?
[19:21:35] <scar2> ... After an X amount of time and/or an X amount of no-hover time (in case someone is reading, etc etc so not to change while active)
[19:22:58] <ricardoandres> like a content-slider ?
[19:23:15] <scar2> ricardoandres: same effect, sort of, but i want the actual accordion or the tabs to do it.
[19:23:27] <scar2> instead of building a slider that does what the accordion/tabs do haha.
[19:23:47] <scar2> figured it'd be easy. i am not familiar with js or jquery timers, or if a "timer" is even the proper term.
[19:26:08] <ricardoandres> check out this code http://pastebin.com/5CeWQvTS

[20:40:35] <Eviltwin> I don't think you understand what this channel is about
[20:40:41] <Eviltwin> Check out jquery.com
[20:41:03] <coldhead> i've heard of that site
[20:58:26] <last1> how can I access the second td element of a specific tr ?
[21:00:39] <kborchers> ?eq @ last1
[21:00:39] <bot-t> last1, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[21:01:53] <Axsuul> what was the click outside jquery plugin again?
[21:02:27] <last1> kborchers: but how will .eq know that I'm trying to match td's inside the tr ?
[21:03:00] <last1> so far I have something like: $(this).closest("tr").each(function() {  var tr=$(this);
[21:03:13] <last1> now I want to access the second td from within tr
[21:03:44] <kborchers> last1: tr.children().eq(1);
[21:06:23] <last1> sweet, this works: tr.children().eq(2).text()
[21:06:38] <Eviltwin> That would be the 3rd one, wouldn't it?
[21:06:45] <last1> it is
[21:07:18] <Axsuul> !help
[21:07:24] <Axsuul> !jquery-click-outside
[21:07:55] <last1> as a general programming question
[21:08:07] <last1> I populate a table with data coming in from MySQL through JSON
[21:08:45] <last1> right now the data is simply printed within <td>'s , not placed in input fields or anything like that
[21:09:13] <last1> I already have data validation on the php script that will re-enter the data, is it 'ok' to get the data through the .text() method ?
[21:09:32] <last1> any reason why it's better to use <input>'s instead of .text() ?
[21:09:56] <Eviltwin> So your data is coming in from MySQL through JSON...through HTML?
[21:10:04] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure I understand
[21:10:28] <last1> jquery requests data from a php script, which in turns gets it from mysql
[21:10:36] <Axsuul> php to javascript should be json, javascript to php should be POST
[21:11:04] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: Um... you're talking about two different things there
[21:11:05] <snover> Axsuul: POST isn’t a data format.
[21:11:09] <solidus-river> hey guys, how do i link a button to a form submit
[21:11:10] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: The data needs to be encoded somehow
[21:11:17] <Axsuul> POST parameters
[21:11:19] <solidus-river> i have a button thats not linked to the form, but on press, i want the form to submit
[21:11:23] <snover> Axsuul: again.
[21:11:26] <last1> POST is just a string
[21:11:36] <solidus-river> so can i find the button element and force it to be "pressed?
[21:11:37] <last1> err, post-data
[21:11:37] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: $("selector-for-my-button").click(function(){$("selector-for-my-form").submit()});
[21:12:07] <Axsuul> ok well hoever PHP accepts POST parameters
[21:12:08] <last1> axsuul: you can also send data to php using GET
[21:12:32] <Axsuul> thats ugly, then you would have to put it int he url
[21:12:33] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: Okay, I want to send a tree of data to PHP
[21:12:36] <snover> Axsuul: please stop saying “POST parameters”, it is nonsense
[21:12:43] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: How do I do it?
[21:12:59] <Eviltwin> last1: So where are these TDs coming in?
[21:13:37] <Axsuul> Eviltwin: you create a form with html tags, with the action being the php script, and submit it
[21:13:55] <last1> ok, traditionally I would have my data sitting properly in a form with various text inputs, etc
[21:14:09] <last1> right now I have data simply printed in between <td> tags
[21:14:11] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: That's literally the worst idea I've ever heard
[21:14:29] <snover> Eviltwin: really? literally the worst?
[21:14:32] <Axsuul> Eviltwin: or you can use ajax
[21:14:37] <snover> Eviltwin: you have not hung out in #jquery much :]
[21:15:01] <Axsuul> Eviltwin: $.ajax and put the parameters in there via POST
[21:15:14] <Eviltwin> You still haven't explained how to send structured data
[21:15:29] <last1> through jquery ?
[21:15:38] <Eviltwin> Through "POST parameters"
[21:15:52] <last1> POST is a request method
[21:15:55] <snover> Axsuul: I don’t know how many times I need to tell you that POST is just an HTTP verb, it imbues no structure whatsoever upon whatever arbitrary content you are sending
[21:16:04] <Axsuul> snover: i know that
[21:16:20] <last1> data transfer for both GET & POST is the same
[21:16:27] <last1> aka, string form
[21:16:30] <snover> so stop saying “POST parameters”, no such thing exists. If you mean application/x-www-form-urlencoded content, that’s a different thing.
[21:16:56] <snover> multipart/form-data is another different thing, and application/json is yet another thing still.
[21:16:57] <Eviltwin> last1: Same string form but with different restrictions
[21:17:05] <last1> 255 chars for GET ?
[21:17:38] <Eviltwin> Something like that
[21:17:50] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: it's a bit more complicated than that as i want to submit my form via an ajax request
[21:18:13] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Look at .serialize and .serializeArray
[21:18:21] <last1> .serializeArray()
[21:18:26] <Axsuul> why not just send a json string then
[21:18:32] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: ...
[21:18:38] <Eviltwin> last1: So you have all these TDs
[21:18:44] <Eviltwin> And you're grabbing data to make an AJAX request?
[21:19:08] <last1> $.ajax({ data: $("#yourform").serializeArray(), ... })
[21:19:12] <Axsuul> if you want structured data..
[21:19:26] <Axsuul> json is the best
[21:19:35] <last1> EvilTwin: ok, let me start from scratch
[21:19:39] <Axsuul> it can easily be converted to a PHP associative array
[21:19:46] <Eviltwin> Axsuul: That's kind of the entire point I was making
[21:19:52] <snover> yay, everyone is a winner
[21:20:00] <Eviltwin> You were saying that all data from PHP to JS should be JSON and all data from JS to PHP should be "POST parameters"
[21:20:13] <Axsuul> ok sorry
[21:20:16] <last1> traditionally I would have all my data sitting in a form with various inputs holding said data
[21:20:45] <last1> now the data is held in between <td></td> tags which i access through: tr.children().eq(1).text() for example
[21:20:51] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:21:01] <last1> is that as safe and as good as the previous method ?
[21:21:25] <last1> I mean, <td>'s were not meant to hold data and I don't know if anything else might get in the way
[21:21:41] <Eviltwin> last1: HTML supports full Unicode
[21:21:47] <last1> styling, extra spaces, etc,
[21:21:47] <Eviltwin> And .text() will extract the Unicode encoding of it
[21:21:52] <Eviltwin> As text
[21:21:55] <Eviltwin> Not HTML or anything like that
[21:22:31] <last1> so whatever I put in the <td></td> when I generated it from my ajax call, will be there unaltered
[21:22:39] <snover> no, it may be altered
[21:22:45] <snover> the DOM is not a reliable data store
[21:23:06] <last1> is the same true for data stored in <input> elements ?
[21:23:08] <snover> the DOM is not a data store at all
[21:23:54] <snover> input values are more reliable, but again, if you are storing data in the DOM you are really doing something wrong and probably need to get a data store
[21:24:31] <last1> I'm just trying to build an interface for editing SQL data
[21:24:33] <Axsuul> where is the data coming from?
[21:24:53] <last1> the data is in between <td>'s temporarily in order to be edited by the user
[21:25:10] <Axsuul> i say store it in an attribute
[21:25:26] <Axsuul> in the data-attribute
[21:25:35] <last1> ?
[21:25:36] <snover> I don’t.
[21:25:53] <Axsuul> html5 has special data-* attributes for storing data in elements
[21:26:13] <Eviltwin> last1: If it's being edited, why aren't they inputs?
[21:26:14] <snover> last1: so, you are trying to create a form for editing sql statements? I would recommend…using a textarea…that people can edit.
[21:26:24] <last1> no, not sql statements
[21:26:26] <Axsuul> in fact, jquery has data() to retrieve those and automatically coerces them
[21:26:44] <snover> Axsuul: that functionality is horrible.
[21:26:51] <last1> say you have an sql table with two columns: username & website
[21:27:02] <last1> jquery connects to a php script and gets 2 rows
[21:27:15] <last1> it then prints them in a nice table
[21:27:36] <snover> <form><table><tr><td><input></td><td><input></td></tr></table></form>
[21:27:36] <last1> how would you go about showing that data to the user and allowing him to modify it ?
[21:27:39] <Axsuul> snover: yea or you don't have to coerce by just using attr() whichi  prefer
[21:28:06] <Axsuul> snover: but i think for most cases, data-* is good enough
[21:28:13] <snover> Axsuul: it really isn’t.
[21:28:25] <last1> snover: assume you don't want an in-place edit
[21:28:33] <last1> at the end of the row you have an 'edit' button
[21:28:36] <Axsuul> i use it all the time, because i have to store data in elements and helps prevent slow lookups
[21:28:49] <snover> <form><table><tr><td><input disabled></td>…
[21:29:10] <last1> ok, so bottom line, you would use an input
[21:29:18] <snover> why wouldn’t you want it to be editable in-place?
[21:29:21] <last1> not just put it in between <td></td> and call .text() ?
[21:29:34] <d3v1an7> Not really query specific, but can you force client reloading of js files like you can with css? i.e., file.js?8979879 <- random number
[21:29:37] <snover> yes, definitely do not do that :)
[21:29:48] <snover> d3v1an7: yes.
[21:30:01] <d3v1an7> snover: thanks mate
[21:30:19] <solidus-river> is there a way via jQuery to trigger a click of a button?
[21:30:27] <last1> snover: can't edit in place because I gave a very simple example. the table has 20 columns. when you click on 'Edit' it opens up a modal window where you can modify all the fields
[21:30:29] <snover> solidus-river: you’re doing it wrong
[21:30:29] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: .click()
[21:30:43] <Axsuul> or trigger('click')
[21:30:48] <Axsuul> if you bind to it that is...
[21:30:55] <Eviltwin> .click() is a shorthand for .trigger('click') ...
[21:30:57] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: so just $("button-selector").click() is the same as clicking the button with a mouse?
[21:31:07] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: No, nothing can realistically emulate that
[21:31:08] <snover> last1: In that case you should associate the table row with the primary key of the data, then use that to look up the correct data when you generate the modal
[21:31:11] <snover> from your data store
[21:31:21] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: well hells bells
[21:31:23] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: What are you trying to do with the click?
[21:31:25] <Axsuul> you want submit() probably
[21:31:27] <last1> so give the <tr> a unique id ?
[21:31:50] <last1> not sure I want to expose my internal id's to the end users
[21:32:00] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: i'm submitting a form via ruby on rails magical data-remot = "true" attribute, if i do form.submit() it does not submit it via ajax or respond correctly, so i want to take the submit button on the form and actually click it
[21:32:07] <solidus-river> but the button is in a different area on the page than the form
[21:32:13] <snover> last1: if you have to be concerned about that, you’re probably doing somethingwrong :)
[21:32:38] <last1> story of my life :)
[21:32:44] <Axsuul> solidus-river: try .trigger('click')
[21:32:56] <snover> solidus-river: you’re doing it wrong.
[21:33:11] <solidus-river> snover: your a cunt
[21:33:15] <solidus-river> snover: ^_^
[21:33:24] <sahbeewah> last1 snover: so would the best way be to, attach the data to the tr or the edit button?
[21:33:45] <Axsuul> sahbeewah: data-* attribute
[21:33:46] <snover> solidus-river: right back at you, friend.
[21:34:22] <sahbeewah> on the tr? is that because it's cleaner?
[21:34:29] <last1> it has to be the tr
[21:34:33] <snover> sahbeewah: <button value="rowid" type="button">Edit</button>
[21:34:37] <Axsuul> whatever you are selecting in jQuery
[21:34:42] <last1> the 'Edit' is caught through .delegated()
[21:34:52] <last1> and it has to be generic
[21:34:54] <Axsuul> you dont want to have to go up and down the tree too much
[21:34:56] <last1> can't make it unique
[21:34:57] <sahbeewah> oh right you're talking about an edit button for the table
[21:35:03] <sahbeewah> i thought you meant an edit button per row
[21:35:09] <last1> no no, it is per row
[21:36:02] <sahbeewah> so what's wrong with attaching an onclick event to .edit buttons, taking in the id as an arg?
[21:36:52] <last1> here's what I'm doing now
[21:36:53] <last1> http://jsfiddle.net/chVex/
[21:37:05] <last1> just modified the code to attach a unique id to the <tr>
[21:37:46] <last1> so when edit is pressed, I can open up the modal window which will pull all the data based on that id
[21:40:33] <trnq> Axsuul: doing prop inside a change() handler worked
[21:40:44] <Axsuul> nice
[21:40:47] <trnq> I suppose that makes sense; inside the click handler the box isn't necessarily going to be checked
[21:40:59] <sahbeewah> something along the lines of onclick="doEdit(id)"
[21:41:01] <trnq> whereas in change() that's responding to it definitely having been changed
[21:41:06] <trnq> aw yeah.
[21:41:21] <sahbeewah> although, i'm not sure how to pass args using delegate/on
[21:41:40] <sahbeewah> wait that doesn't make sense
[21:42:27] <sahbeewah> but if you put the data- attr on the edit button you can just go $(this).data(...)
[21:42:35] <sahbeewah> as opposed to the tr
[21:42:49] <sahbeewah> although there's probably semantic issues with that
[21:46:12] <last1> so to recap
[21:46:24] <last1> is it safe to have it stored as <tr id="unique_key"> ?
[21:46:36] <Axsuul> yea
[21:46:43] <Axsuul> seriously its fine
[21:46:44] <last1> and retrieve it with: tr.attr('id')
[21:46:48] <last1> ok, good :)
[21:47:11] <sahbeewah> i
[21:47:15] <sahbeewah> don't think you can have html ids as numbers
[21:47:19] <sgronblo> I have a change handler on a checkbox. I have brekapoint inside it. In this case I just unchecked the checkbox, however in my handler my_checkbox.attr('checked') returns 'checked'...
[21:47:34] <Eviltwin> They need to begin with a letter
[21:47:47] <Axsuul> sahbeewah: you can namespace it
[21:47:47] <Eviltwin> Then they can have numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes as well
[21:47:47] <sahbeewah> yea
[21:47:54] <sahbeewah> so you should probably use data anyway
[21:48:08] <trnq> sgronblo: using prop for that is working for me
[21:48:20] <trnq> sgronblo: I literally *just* asked the same(ish) question
[21:48:23] <Axsuul> you can select the element via the id, and retrieve the id through the data-attribute
[21:48:25] <trnq> and not literally...
[21:48:51] <last1> gah
[21:48:55] <snover> last1: I gave you a solution…not sure what the problem is :)
[21:49:06] <last1> an id I have starts with '12..'
[21:49:10] <sgronblo> trnq: so what was the problem?
[21:49:10] <last1> and it still shows up fine
[21:49:18] <Axsuul> last1: it's just not valid
[21:49:26] <last1> what does that mean ?
[21:49:31] <trnq> sgronblo: no idea
[21:49:47] <amh345> is this the correct way to swap an image src?		document.getElementById(img_id).src.replace("some_image.png");
[21:50:08] <Axsuul> last1: if you run it through an html validator
[21:50:25] <Axsuul> last1: just like you can use the same ids, but u're not supposed to
[21:50:31] <sgronblo> trnq: ah its all here http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[21:50:33] <sgronblo> $(elem).attr("checked")(1.6)"checked" (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change
[21:50:38] <snover> last1: what was wrong with the solution that I gave you?
[21:50:54] <last1> with the datastore ?
[21:50:55] <trnq> sgronblo: good to know; thank ya
[21:50:55] <Eviltwin> amh345: .src="some_image.png"
[21:50:56] <Eviltwin> WOrks
[21:51:12] <sgronblo> trnq: no problem and thanks to your for reminding me of prop
[21:51:27] <sgronblo> mutual exchange of information, wonderful
[21:53:04] <last1> snover: I think it won't work because my edit 'button' is in fact an <a><img></a>
[21:53:15] <snover> last1: why? why would you do that?
[21:53:39] <last1> I bought a theme... :)
[21:53:52] <snover> a theme with no css sprites?
[21:53:56] <last1> they use this: <a href='#' class='editUser'><img src='gfx/icon-edit.png' alt='edit' /></a>
[21:54:21] <snover> aight, well, good luck!
[21:54:25] <sahbeewah> lol
[21:54:36] <last1> yeah, I know ... :P
[21:55:05] <sahbeewah> did you buy it with... money?
[21:55:35] <bobnormal> is there a way to do something like Prototype/Scriptaculous's 'Effect.Move()' (visible @ http://script.aculo.us/ for the logo in the top left). i can't find one.
[21:56:44] <bobnormal> i sort of feel like the Effect.animate() thing might help, but I'd prefer not to roll my own if possible.
[21:57:32] <sahbeewah> what do you mean by roll your own
[21:58:24] <snover> bobnormal: it’s an animation of the top and left properties of an element…
[22:00:41] <bobnormal> ok.
[22:03:32] <amh345> is there a way to find where an alert is coming from?
[22:07:48] <sahbeewah> use a debugger?
[22:07:51] <sahbeewah> why would you want to do that?
[22:08:40] <amh345> i dont remember where im triggering it from?  i search the entire project and i cant find.
[22:08:41] <dwarder> so that you can see the values ===)))
[22:11:32] <last1> thank you everyone
[22:11:35] <last1> good night
[22:11:51] <sahbeewah> yea just use a debugger like chrome
[22:11:59] <sahbeewah> place a breakpoint and step through it
[22:12:11] <sahbeewah> if your project is that large
[22:20:02] <Axsuul> what is the difference between using... $('.foo')[0] and $('.foo').eq(0)?
[22:21:47] <context> [0] returns the element itself
[22:21:53] <context> .eq() returns a jQuery object
[22:22:08] <coldhead> thanks context
[22:28:05] <Axsuul> ty
[22:28:35] <coldhead> bot-t: hey
[22:28:35] <bot-t> coldhead, :)
[22:37:03] <amh345> what am i doing wrong here?  http://jsfiddle.net/CCBJ5/1/     im trying to set a variable on click (which is able to set properly.  but when i call it later on my submit i get an undefined
[22:39:27] <coldhead> amh345: document.getElementById(getImageId).src="new_image.jpg";
[22:39:39] <coldhead> what's with getElementById and why are you passing it a function
[22:42:06] <amh345> coldhead: i read it on a site for global variables (which is what i think i need).    i tried it after document.getElementById(img_id).src="new_image.jpg"; came up undefined as well.
[22:42:55] <coldhead> $('#' + window.img_id).attr('src', 'new_image.jpg');
[22:44:16] <amh345> and that's suppose to set it?
[22:47:16] <coldhead> that will retrieve the previously set ID
[22:47:26] <coldhead> and update the image's src attr
[22:48:59] <tga> greetings
[22:57:37] <tga> if I select a bunch of elements, how can I use .find() inside of each one in a loop?
[22:58:33] <tga> I must be missing something, when I loop over the elements I can't use .find() on them
[23:01:13] <sahbeewah> wrap it with $()
[23:01:56] <amh345> coldhead: when i wrap my livequery click in the function, i cant even get it to alert
[23:02:04] <Eviltwin> The this inside the loop is the element itslef, not a jQuery object representing that element
[23:02:19] <coldhead> amh345: are you calling the function?
[23:02:44] <coldhead> it's not clear to me why you have a named function around your .live
[23:02:55] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[23:03:08] <amh345> im not clear either. im totally confused.
[23:03:34] <coldhead> amh345: do you just want to get the ID of the last clicked image when you submit?
[23:04:35] <amh345> i want to click a link in my modal.  get the id.  i can do that with a simple .live('click, function()_.....   and i want to grab that id later on so i can use it to swap an image
[23:04:40] <amh345> coldhead: ^
[23:05:15] <amh345> i was under the impress that i was to use a glabal var to do that. and a global var needed to be wrapped in a function
[23:06:10] <tga> is it reasonable to have something like 10k rows in a table and check each text against 3-4 filters?
[23:06:30] <amh345> coldhead: i figured it out.  i removed the named function.
[23:07:17] <coldhead> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/PqB6J/1/
[23:07:26] <coldhead> that's how i'd avoid the global variable
[23:07:31] <coldhead> lean on that old DOM
[23:07:36] <coldhead> that old kentucky DOM
[23:08:33] <amh345> oh. i see.
[23:08:36] <Eviltwin> Mmm...kentucky DOM
[23:19:07] <tga> so if I want to look at each <option> in a table and do something depending on its value
[23:19:27] <tga> is it reasonable to do something like var rows = $(".table_row")
[23:20:07] <tga> and then for(i in rows) { var option = rows[i].find("option") } ?
[23:20:32] <coldhead> ?each @ tga
[23:20:32] <bot-t> tga, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[23:20:51] <tga> mm, I see
[23:31:42] <Xotix> hi
[23:32:22] <Hierofant> hi
[23:33:26] <Xotix> what could be the reason, that $(window).load(function(){ gets called twice?
[23:34:43] <coldhead> something calling $(window).trigger('load') perhaps?
[23:34:52] <coldhead> or maybe you have two windows
[23:35:10] <coldhead> if you're using windows as your operating system, you might have too many windows
[23:35:38] <Xotix> im not on windows. and im calling load just once
[23:36:54] <Xotix> i think i got it...
